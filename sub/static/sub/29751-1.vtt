16:38.954 --> 16:40.521
Who the fuck are you?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.088
- The guy that owns this place.

16:43.089 --> 16:43.915
- Lookit, look,

16:45.134 --> 16:47.136
there's no flow
being all casual.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.485
But we can turn this
thing around.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.053
Come on, man!
- Alright, I know.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.011
- [Father] Where's Cameron?

16:53.186 --> 16:56.058
[upbeat rap music]

17:00.845 --> 17:02.847
- Alright, I got
something wicked, right?

17:02.891 --> 17:05.111
- For shizzle, you got this,
baby.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.461
Bring the sexy, you
know how we do it.

17:07.503 --> 17:08.679
There you go.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.723
Let's keep it going.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.858
- Cameron!
- Woo, shit.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.730
- What the hell is
going on here?

17:15.772 --> 17:17.471
- Dad, what are you doing here?

17:17.513 --> 17:19.560
- What am I doing here?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.083
The question is: What
the hell are you doing

17:21.127 --> 17:22.519
throwing a party in my house?

17:22.563 --> 17:24.652
- Look, I didn't know
there'd be so many people.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.567
I'm sorry.
- Stop!

17:27.481 --> 17:29.222
Okay, just stop.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.267
You know, I've been
calling you for days now.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.445
And now you've got the balls
to throw a kegger in my house?

17:35.489 --> 17:36.316
- Dad!

17:37.752 --> 17:40.015
Can we just go to my room
to talk, please?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.495
- Dammit, go!

17:44.541 --> 17:48.676
- Okay, so, it's $100
just to touch 'em.

17:51.113 --> 17:51.940
Thank you.

17:57.902 --> 17:58.729
- Awesome!

[woman gasps]

18:11.438 --> 18:13.004
- Listen, Cameron.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.354
If you wanted to
throw a pool party

18:14.397 --> 18:15.833
you could have just asked me.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.487
But this?

18:18.488 --> 18:19.968
This is ridiculous.

18:20.969 --> 18:21.796
- I'm sorry.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.801
Look, I know I shoulda
returned your calls.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.717
What do you think of
the website?

18:35.418 --> 18:37.855
- What's your perspective
operating costs?

18:37.899 --> 18:38.856
Hmm?

18:38.900 --> 18:39.640
What's the ROI?

18:40.858 --> 18:41.990
- I mean, we're still
tinkering with it.

18:42.033 --> 18:42.991
- Tinkering, my ass!

18:43.034 --> 18:44.732
Do you even have a
business plan?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.299
- Yeah, my friend john
is writing one.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.562
- You know what, John?

18:48.605 --> 18:49.824
I mean, if Tim were
doing this thing,

18:49.867 --> 18:50.825
he'd have every bit of this--
- I'm not Tim!

18:50.868 --> 18:52.087
- I understand you're not Tim.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.871
That's the damn reason
I'm talking about this--

18:53.915 --> 18:54.698
- Dad!

18:54.742 --> 18:55.656
Enough.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.486
Why do you always compare?

19:02.880 --> 19:03.707
Forget it.

19:09.017 --> 19:09.844
- Sorry.

19:14.501 --> 19:15.328
Sorry.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.722
Have you talked to Tim lately?

19:20.202 --> 19:20.855
- Why?

19:22.030 --> 19:23.379
- [Dad] You know he's
forgiven you.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.078
- I doubt that.

19:29.342 --> 19:30.734
- [Dad] Well, you'll find
out in a couple of days

19:30.778 --> 19:31.866
at the family reunion.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.957
Oh, and your cousin
Shelby's gonna be there.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.915
I know you always
love seeing her.

19:37.959 --> 19:38.786
- Yeah.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.835
Don't count on me being there,
alright?

19:58.980 --> 20:01.287
- I asked you a fucking
question, tough guy.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.984
- Party foul, friend,
shit happens.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.420
- You're goddamn right it does.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.160
- Look,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.815
tell me how you want
this to end.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.297
Do you assholes even go

21:08.919 --> 21:11.966
- Oh yes, I got it all on tape.

You are going to be famous.

Haven't you checked it out yet?

21:20.583 --> 21:21.149
- Not yet.

- Come on!

21:36.643 --> 21:38.732
You should think about entering,

21:38.775 --> 21:41.169
I mean, who could use
the money more than you?

21:43.867 --> 21:45.695

have enough time.

He's alright.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.043
- Nah!

23:57.174 --> 23:59.089
I'm moving one box at a time.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.834
I could use the exercise.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.402
Besides, it'll be awhile
before the orphanage

24:07.446 --> 24:09.273
moves into a smaller space.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.233
- [Jeff] How much are you
behind on rent?

24:13.060 --> 24:14.583
- $20,000.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.019
It's okay, though.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.368
God works in mysterious ways.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.590
Maybe this way, each orphan
will get more attention.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.506
- Mysterious ways?

24:27.466 --> 24:30.207
Funny, I just thought
He was deaf.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.080
- You have to have faith,
my son.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.433
- I've given faith a try before.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.395
[sighs] What can you tell
me about faith?

24:48.225 --> 24:49.052
- Let's talk.

I could use a little help

access to the net?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.601
- Yeah, why?

25:20.301 --> 25:21.520
I'm thinking about entering.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.348
- It says here, the game's
gonna be played

25:24.392 --> 25:26.307
in the mountains and
you'll be camping.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.570
You didn't join the Girl Scouts

25:28.614 --> 25:30.616
because you're terrified
of the outdoors.

25:30.659 --> 25:33.575
- No, I was terrified of
your camp-side ghost stories.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.490
[laughs]

25:35.534 --> 25:39.668
Besides, I really
need the money.

25:39.712 --> 25:40.582
It's not just me.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.194
Mom, and--
- Look, I gotta go, okay?

25:44.238 --> 25:47.154
I can't deal with
mom's problems.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.635
You know?
- No.

25:49.678 --> 25:50.505
Of course not.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.467
- I'll be following you online,
okay?

25:56.511 --> 25:58.078
I hope you get in, I really do.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.561
- Great.
- I love you.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.432

pull this shit.

why are you ignoring me?

27:49.406 --> 27:50.407
- No, I'm not fucking
ignoring you!

27:50.451 --> 27:51.974
- Why can't you answer
the fucking--

- Every goddamn time, I've
answered every fucking question

27:53.889 --> 27:55.064
that you've asked--
- I'm walking out.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.196
- Oh yeah, pull that shit.

27:56.239 --> 27:57.545
No, this is bullshit.

27:57.588 --> 27:58.764
You're not gonna be doing this.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.243
Bullshit, no, no!

28:00.287 --> 28:02.593
Every fucking time, you
pull this shit!

28:02.637 --> 28:04.813
I'm trying to work through it,
okay?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.380
- Work through?
- You have no patience.

28:06.423 --> 28:07.424
- You are such a fucking liar.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.338
- Bullshit.
- I'm done.

borrow some facial cream, hun.

- I'm in.

28:33.102 --> 28:33.886

28:33.929 --> 28:35.191
- The final prank.

28:35.235 --> 28:36.889
I'm in.

28:36.932 --> 28:37.716

28:59.215 --> 29:00.956
Precaution advised.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.524
- Precaution advised?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.353
- You're going down
those train tracks

29:06.396 --> 29:08.921
just like Alice
Drexler [laughs].

29:12.794 --> 29:14.187
We're almost here.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.666
- [Jenn] This is stupid.

29:15.710 --> 29:16.929
I don't even know
where I'm going.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.321
- Dude, don't worry.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.062
My friend Katie knows this girl,
Nicky,

29:20.106 --> 29:22.151
who heard from somebody
that they've set all

29:22.195 --> 29:23.544
all sorts of safety precautions.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.807
You're totally safe!

29:25.851 --> 29:27.678
- [sighs] Great, I feel
so much better

29:27.722 --> 29:30.333
because Nicky's anonymous
friend says it's okay.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.903
- You, you're gonna film it all,
right?

29:34.947 --> 29:36.470
- They said not to
bring anything.

29:36.513 --> 29:39.821
- Jenn, break the rules
every now and then.

29:42.258 --> 29:45.348
Don't worry, I brought my
camera, and you can borrow it.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.876
- Thanks.
- [laughs] You're welcome.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.660
Now, go have fun.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.402
This is your first time
getting away from it all.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.707
- You're right.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.106
- I'm so jealous.
- You're gonna watch,

30:04.150 --> 30:05.586
online, all weekend, right?
- Yes.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.675
I will watch online all weekend.

30:08.807 --> 30:09.720
Get out of my car.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.377
Love you!
- Love you.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.387
[locker clatters]

30:24.431 --> 30:26.041
Oh, my god.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.046
We have

30:32.178 --> 30:33.353
our mace.

30:34.920 --> 30:35.921
GPS.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.361
Spaceman head cam thing.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.102
Train ticket, check on the card

30:44.581 --> 30:47.671
with a bear, fantastic, good,
bears.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.369
Exactly what I was hoping for.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.807
Alright,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.635
we have a map.

30:54.678 --> 30:57.116
We're getting close.

30:57.159 --> 31:00.293
[train whistle blows]

31:12.087 --> 31:14.046
[sighs]

31:16.178 --> 31:19.878
[ominous instrumental music]

31:28.277 --> 31:30.279
Hi, excuse me, sir.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.587
Could you tell me how
to get to this location?

31:34.762 --> 31:37.069
- Yeah, well, let's have
a look-see here.

31:37.112 --> 31:40.420
Now, well, you wanna go there?

31:40.463 --> 31:41.290
- I think so.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.207
- Well, I'm headed
that way myself.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.774
Would you like to hitch a ride?

31:46.817 --> 31:47.644
- Ah,

31:49.037 --> 31:51.518
yeah, sure, if it's not
too much trouble.

31:51.561 --> 31:52.911
- Well, sure, come on.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.565
Just climb right in and I'll
take you right up there.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.572
[engine rumbling]

32:02.616 --> 32:05.488
So, what brings you
to these parts?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.491
- I'm here to play a game.

32:09.884 --> 32:13.279
- [laughs] What kind of
a game is it?

32:14.410 --> 32:15.977
- I don't know really.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.762
- You know, nobody goes up
there where you're going

32:18.806 --> 32:21.026
no more.
- Why not?

32:21.069 --> 32:24.290
- Well, it's just that some
college kids from the city

32:24.333 --> 32:27.206
went up there a few
years back to camp out,

32:27.249 --> 32:31.210
and [laughs] well, they
called it a game,

32:31.253 --> 32:32.994
but it was a game of death.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.475
They each one made a
hangman's noose.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.695
And then they threw the
ropes over the tree limb

32:38.739 --> 32:40.001
and stood on a platform.

32:41.350 --> 32:44.440
Each one of 'em put his
head into the noose.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.618
Well, it was like these
geniuses wanted

32:48.662 --> 32:50.838
to play the hangman's
game for real.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.581
And they just should've
fallen a few inches.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.019
But something happened.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.635
- You think someone killed them?

33:05.679 --> 33:07.072
- Well, they never
caught no one.

33:08.725 --> 33:12.425
Police finally just said it
was a college prank gone bad.

33:13.643 --> 33:16.037
[chuckles] Well, they
always say that

33:16.081 --> 33:18.822
so the tourists don't
get scared off.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.434
But rumor has it,

33:22.609 --> 33:24.915
the killer's still out
there somewhere,

33:26.308 --> 33:28.397
waiting for his next victim.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.708
[sighs]

33:36.101 --> 33:38.625
[brakes squeal]

33:38.668 --> 33:39.756
- Why are we stopping?

33:41.454 --> 33:43.586
- We're here.
- We're here?

33:44.718 --> 33:46.633
- You see that trail over there?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.679
You just follow that trail

33:49.723 --> 33:51.899
and it'll take you right
up to where you wanna go.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.947
- Of course, a deserted trail.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.514
- Give you a ride back to town?

33:59.515 --> 34:02.127
- No, thank you for the ride.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.041
- Any time.

34:05.086 --> 34:08.610
I wouldn't mind getting
to know you better!

34:08.655 --> 34:11.788
[laughing maniacally]

34:26.107 --> 34:29.850
[birds chirping and singing]

34:44.038 --> 34:47.781
[ominous instrumental music]

35:08.410 --> 35:10.195
[liquid trickling]

35:10.238 --> 35:11.631
- Oh, sorry to interrupt!

35:14.416 --> 35:16.462
- You must be Jennifer?

35:16.505 --> 35:18.333
I saw your picture on the
College Pranks website.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.422
- Oh, you can just call me Jenn.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.989
- Cameron.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.644
I'm sorry, ah, my
friends call me Cam.

35:25.558 --> 35:26.385
- You're crazy.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.429
- [Cam] I've seen you around.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.127
Do you go to the
coffee house a lot?

35:29.170 --> 35:30.563
- [Jenn] Yeah, sometimes.

35:30.606 --> 35:31.041
- Alright.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.915
Well, what do you think
they're gonna have us be doing?

35:34.958 --> 35:35.872
Do you think it's gonna be like,

35:35.916 --> 35:36.830
one of those survivalist shows?

35:36.873 --> 35:38.614
You know, with pranks?

35:38.658 --> 35:40.442
You know, last man?

35:40.486 --> 35:43.750
Or woman standing.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.926
- I bet they're just
gonna have us eat like,

35:45.969 --> 35:48.450
bugs and grubs and--
- Well, that's not bad.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.496
As long as there's no
pigs feet or cow brains.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.586
- [laughs] I vote we
just survive the elements

35:53.629 --> 35:56.937
and then deal with whatever
pranks they throw at us.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.505
- Well, if we do have to
vote people off,

35:59.548 --> 36:01.681
you wanna get an alliance?

36:03.639 --> 36:04.858
- I'll get back to you on that.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.468
- Hey, wait up!

36:07.817 --> 36:10.472
[panting] I'm Jeff.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.606
- Good lord, did you
swim up here, bro?

36:14.694 --> 36:16.348
- I need to get in shape.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.176
- Ah, yeah, I'd say so.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.094
- I think the rules say we're
supposed to have cameras on.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.011
- Oh, God, Mr. Rules
and Regulations.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.665
- I didn't make the rules.

36:29.709 --> 36:33.800
I just think we were supposed
to record our first meeting.

36:33.843 --> 36:34.670
- He's right.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.064
- [Cam] Alright, fine.

36:40.110 --> 36:40.937
- I'm dying here.

36:42.025 --> 36:42.983
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.074
- [Cam] Just take some
deep breaths.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.162
You'll be alright.

36:50.033 --> 36:50.860
- Fine.

36:57.258 --> 36:59.478
- Hey, everybody, I'm Cameron.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.001
You know me.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.786
I'm the guy that's
gonna win the 25 K.

37:03.830 --> 37:04.787
- Oh, that's my boy.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.876
That's my boy, okay.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.530
- [Jenn] Keep dreaming.

37:08.574 --> 37:09.966
- Please.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.360
- Hey, I'm Jeff.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.885
I'm a Pisces.

37:18.671 --> 37:19.802
- Who's this Jeff geek?

37:26.505 --> 37:29.159
[Jeff sighs]

37:29.203 --> 37:32.946
[ominous instrumental music]

37:52.574 --> 37:54.272
- It is so beautiful!

37:57.013 --> 37:58.667
Those have to be 13
years or 14 years--

37:58.711 --> 38:00.278
- Oh, look at that!

38:00.321 --> 38:01.801
Okay, look.
- Look at that.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.977
- I cannot believe, he's
looking at her boot.

38:04.020 --> 38:07.807
He's looking at that booty.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.591
[cheering]

38:09.635 --> 38:11.332
- That is some great scenery.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.900
- There it is!
[cheering]

38:19.122 --> 38:21.473
- You better hurry up,
we're only halfway there.

38:36.444 --> 38:39.665
- They got us hooked up.
- Or something.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.015
Wow!
- Alright, cool.

38:43.625 --> 38:44.496
Nice, what's that?

38:47.237 --> 38:49.588
- Welcome to the College
Pranks campsite.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.503
The game begins
tomorrow morning.

38:51.546 --> 38:54.462
Get your rest, you'll need it.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.333
- Cool.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.336
Alright.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.294
Flashlights.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.602
- Hey, don't you think
it's kinda weird

39:03.645 --> 39:05.473
that no one from the game
came here to meet us?

39:05.517 --> 39:08.824
- What, like some type
of game host or what?

39:08.868 --> 39:10.086
- I don't know.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.307
- Well, maybe we'll
meet 'em tomorrow.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.308
Mystery guest.

39:15.962 --> 39:18.007
Here.
- You know what you're doing?

39:19.226 --> 39:21.359
- Yeah, I did grow up
in the Outback.

39:22.490 --> 39:26.407
- Australia?
- Ah, yes a diggery do.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.149
Good day, mate, throw
another Sheila on the barbie!

39:29.192 --> 39:31.412
[gasps]

39:31.456 --> 39:32.979
[laughing]

39:33.022 --> 39:35.024
These are lame.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.070
- Let's just get back to work.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.682
- You want me to show you
how to do this?

39:40.726 --> 39:42.118
- No, that's okay.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.991
My talent is winning the 25 K.

39:45.034 --> 39:48.386
- Wow, I guess that is
a good survival skill.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.258
Alright.

40:00.746 --> 40:04.402
- [gasps] Let me know if you
find a tank of oxygen in there.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.230
- Well, you made it, so relax.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.275
Take a load off.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.365
I guess we'll get
firewood in a bit.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.064
- How about you two
honeymooners take that tent?

40:15.108 --> 40:17.937
And I'll take this one.
- [laughs] Wait.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.200
You never know, by the end
of the night you might--

40:20.243 --> 40:21.331
- Not gonna happen.

40:22.594 --> 40:25.335
- Well, that hangman
character you mentioned,

40:25.379 --> 40:28.251
he could still be lurking
around these woods.

40:28.295 --> 40:30.297
- Well, that's why God
invented pepper spray.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.734
- Alright, alright, well played.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.302
Just make sure you get
the hangman and not me.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.178
[eerie instrumental music]
[Jenn gasps]

40:42.222 --> 40:43.049
- [Cam] Hey!

40:44.833 --> 40:46.313
Who the fuck are you?

40:46.356 --> 40:47.967
- Whoa!

40:48.010 --> 40:49.577
Chill, I'm Trevor.

40:50.665 --> 40:51.710
- [Cam] Yeah, who?

40:51.753 --> 40:53.102
- [Jenn] The fourth player.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.410
- You can just call me
the Wild Card.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.767
- You even go to
Penderton College?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.204
I've never seen you on campus.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.338
- [sighs] Nope.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.865
- Huh, well?

41:18.911 --> 41:19.694
- Well what?

41:22.088 --> 41:23.916
- Where do

41:23.959 --> 41:25.787
you go

41:25.831 --> 41:27.876
to school?

41:31.358 --> 41:34.666
- Worton College, down South.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.494
- Well, welcome to the game,
Trevor.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.626
I mean, Wild Card.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.934
I'm Jenn, and this is Cameron,
and Jeff.

41:45.677 --> 41:48.027
- Come on, Jenn, let's
go get firewood.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.463
We'll go together.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.291
- Who made you queen
of the jungle?

41:56.426 --> 41:57.863
Oh, my god!

41:57.906 --> 42:00.605
That Jenn girl is one
fine piece of ass!

42:03.999 --> 42:07.699
[ominous instrumental music]

42:12.834 --> 42:13.835
- Come on, he's okay.

42:15.315 --> 42:18.492
- Yeah, famous last words
from the Hangman's victim.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.277
- I never should of told you
that crazy old man's story.

42:22.627 --> 42:23.453
- Let's get wood.

42:45.345 --> 42:47.129
[ominous instrumental music]

42:47.173 --> 42:48.000
[clattering]

42:48.043 --> 42:49.567
- [Cam] Jenn, help!

42:50.829 --> 42:51.612
Jenn!

42:53.222 --> 42:54.702
Jenn, over here!

42:56.269 --> 42:57.052
[laughs]
- Oh, my god!

42:57.096 --> 42:57.923
Are you okay?

42:59.489 --> 43:01.927
- Now this is what I
call a prank!

43:01.970 --> 43:03.276
- [Jenn] Hold on a second.

43:04.669 --> 43:05.495
- Oh yeah.

43:06.409 --> 43:07.193
[Cam thuds and groans]

43:07.236 --> 43:08.063
- [Jenn] Sorry!

43:10.326 --> 43:13.591
[laughs]
- Thanks for letting me down.

43:13.634 --> 43:15.462
- You would of done
the same for me.

43:15.505 --> 43:17.159
- Well, I'd do you.

43:17.203 --> 43:19.161
I mean, I would of done
the same for you.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.903
- You can let go of me now.

43:21.947 --> 43:24.166
[groaning]

43:30.172 --> 43:35.090
[crickets chirping]
[fire crackling]

43:36.701 --> 43:39.007
[owl hoots]

43:43.838 --> 43:45.884
- What took you guys so long?

43:45.927 --> 43:47.755
- Cameron got pranked.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.496
- [laughs] Really?

43:49.539 --> 43:50.628
- What was it?

43:50.671 --> 43:52.238
- Rope snare strung him up.

43:52.281 --> 43:53.108
- [Cam] Yep.

43:55.763 --> 43:57.635
- So, you gonna make us dinner?

43:57.678 --> 43:59.288
- Do I look like room service?

44:09.864 --> 44:10.648
- Thanks.

44:11.823 --> 44:13.955
[laughing]

44:13.999 --> 44:14.826
- My man!

44:18.394 --> 44:19.308
- You guys hungry?

44:24.052 --> 44:24.879
- Thanks.

44:24.923 --> 44:25.706
- There you go, here.

44:29.928 --> 44:30.711
Jeff.

44:32.844 --> 44:33.671
[scoffs]

44:33.714 --> 44:36.586
So, Jenn, what is your major?

44:37.762 --> 44:41.330
- Psych.
- Oh nice, what year?

44:41.374 --> 44:44.856
- Last of undergrad, you?
- Cool, second year, Biz-Ad.

44:46.074 --> 44:47.597
Psych, huh?

44:47.641 --> 44:50.078
So does that mean you're
gonna be analyzing all of us?

44:50.122 --> 44:51.689
- [laughs] I might have
seen a picture

44:51.732 --> 44:54.343
of the three of you in
my Abnormal Psych book.

44:54.387 --> 44:55.562
- [Cam] What about you, Trevor?

44:55.605 --> 44:57.651
- Software engineering.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.653
- [Jenn] No offense, but--

44:59.697 --> 45:01.524
- You would of never guessed?

45:01.568 --> 45:02.395
I know.

45:03.701 --> 45:04.702
Jeff, what about you?

45:06.660 --> 45:08.488
- Undeclared, third.

45:09.402 --> 45:11.273
- Dude, you can't be.

45:11.317 --> 45:14.450
You have to be declared by
the end of your second year.

45:14.494 --> 45:16.626
- I know, I just transferred in

45:16.670 --> 45:18.890
from a school from the Springs.

45:20.282 --> 45:23.416
- Now this is how you
cook a hotdog, children.

45:23.459 --> 45:25.287
- Yeah, if you're a
sexual offender.

45:25.331 --> 45:27.072
- [Trevor] Like
you're an expert?

45:27.115 --> 45:29.901
- Look, I know how to survive
in the wild, Sasquatch!

45:29.944 --> 45:31.903
- Like, in Australia?
- Yeah, that.

45:33.295 --> 45:35.341
And an African safari
with my brother and pops.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.126
A month long expedition
through the jungles

45:38.170 --> 45:40.912
in South America.
- [scoffs] Yeah right.

45:40.955 --> 45:43.523
Here come the war stories.

45:43.566 --> 45:46.352
Remember, she's a psych major.

45:46.395 --> 45:47.745
She'll know if you're lying.

45:49.529 --> 45:50.356
- Alright.

45:52.010 --> 45:55.753
A couple years back we were
trekking through Venezuela,

45:56.754 --> 45:57.842
right along the Orinoco river.

45:59.408 --> 46:02.629
And we had to cross with 70
pounds of gear on our back

46:02.672 --> 46:04.196
and water up to our necks.

46:06.111 --> 46:08.548
And we got about three
quarters of the way across,

46:10.680 --> 46:11.507
and the water,

46:14.206 --> 46:15.773
it looked like it was trembling.

46:17.035 --> 46:17.818
- [Jenn] What?

46:19.254 --> 46:20.168
- Piranhas.

46:21.691 --> 46:23.519
- That's when I bumped
my brother Tim,

46:24.956 --> 46:27.132
and he just plunged right
under the water.

46:30.265 --> 46:33.051
Finally I was able to
pull him to shore.

46:34.530 --> 46:37.011
But it was sheer willpower
that got us out of there.

46:38.447 --> 46:40.580
Willpower, that's why
I'm alive today.

46:43.017 --> 46:44.802
- Or, you weren't meant to die.

46:46.673 --> 46:48.327
- What, you mean like,
God's plan?

46:49.545 --> 46:50.372
I disagree.

46:52.244 --> 46:53.680
We saved ourselves out there.

46:57.553 --> 46:59.817
[clapping]

47:02.820 --> 47:06.519
- So, Dr. Jenn, is he
telling the truth?

47:07.737 --> 47:08.956
- I'm not a psychic.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.262
- We all have our scars.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.570
I grew up fending for myself.

47:18.313 --> 47:20.446
And when things got rough,

47:24.015 --> 47:25.625
I found comfort in drugs.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.414
But the more I took,

47:37.811 --> 47:40.379
I did terrible things.

47:43.034 --> 47:45.079
- Like what kind of
terrible things?

47:47.908 --> 47:49.736
[branch breaks]
- Did you hear that?

47:51.172 --> 47:54.393
- Oh, it's gotta be
the pranksters.

47:54.436 --> 47:58.876
- Are we gonna go after
every little sound we hear?

48:00.007 --> 48:01.313
- There are animals
in the woods.

48:01.356 --> 48:02.967
You know, wild animals?

48:04.098 --> 48:06.013
- Come on, let's go
check it out!

48:06.057 --> 48:07.536
Look, Jeff,

48:08.494 --> 48:10.235
I've got protection, come on!

48:14.500 --> 48:17.807
- I got protection, too,
but it's lubricated.

48:19.853 --> 48:21.289
And I'm talking to myself.

48:25.728 --> 48:29.471
[ominous instrumental music]

48:35.521 --> 48:36.348
You miss me yet?

48:36.391 --> 48:37.523
[shushing]

48:37.566 --> 48:39.351
Hey, what was that?

48:39.394 --> 48:41.353
- [Jenn] I didn't hear Anything.

48:41.396 --> 48:42.745
- [Trevor] Come on,
take my hand.

48:48.534 --> 48:50.231
- That's disgusting.

48:51.450 --> 48:53.104
- Looks like pig guts.

48:53.147 --> 48:54.496
- [Jenn] What, a wild pig?

48:54.540 --> 48:56.629
What would even cause that?

48:56.672 --> 49:00.154
- No, it's gotta be a prank.

49:00.198 --> 49:02.940
Otherwise this would be an
all-you-can-eat bear buffet.

49:02.983 --> 49:04.593
- Pig guts?

49:04.637 --> 49:07.074
That's weak, I can do
better than that.

49:07.118 --> 49:08.467
- Weak, he's right.

49:08.510 --> 49:10.469
It could attract bears.

49:10.512 --> 49:13.211
- Well, Tarzan, maybe you
could swing down a rope

49:13.254 --> 49:15.778
onto a bear's back, stab
it in the neck,

49:15.822 --> 49:18.259
and drink the blood out
of a boar's tusk.

49:18.303 --> 49:19.130
- Hey!

49:20.522 --> 49:21.697
There's something over there.

49:22.829 --> 49:25.223
Come on, Trevor, let's
check it out.

49:25.266 --> 49:27.225
- I don't have anything.

49:28.966 --> 49:29.792
My hero.

49:39.106 --> 49:40.934
- Will you wait here
while I go find a bush?

49:40.978 --> 49:41.717
- No problem.

49:43.067 --> 49:46.984
Stay within shouting distance.

Where are you?

This better not be a prank,
you guys!

[gasping] Jeff, Jeff!

50:40.733 --> 50:41.995

Anyone, please!

[gasping]

50:49.307 --> 50:50.873
Cam, where are you?

- [Cam] Jenn!

50:58.185 --> 50:59.882
Jenn wait, I see you.

50:59.926 --> 51:01.145
Just wait there.

51:02.581 --> 51:05.105
[Jenn gasping]

51:06.150 --> 51:08.195
Hey, are you alright?
- Yeah.

51:08.239 --> 51:09.066
Where's Trevor?

51:09.979 --> 51:11.459
- Shopping for balls.

51:11.503 --> 51:14.245
What was that noise?
- I don't know.

51:14.288 --> 51:16.812
I found the rest of the
pig in a tree.

51:16.856 --> 51:18.858
It's not what I would
call a funny prank.

51:19.859 --> 51:20.816
- Creepy.

51:21.774 --> 51:22.601
Come on.

51:35.048 --> 51:35.831
- [Jeff] Guys!

51:37.137 --> 51:37.964
Help!

51:38.834 --> 51:39.792
Anybody!

51:41.533 --> 51:43.056
Help!

51:44.144 --> 51:45.754
[laughing]

51:45.798 --> 51:47.408
I went to go to the bathroom.

51:47.452 --> 51:49.149
- Man, let the pranks begin.

51:49.193 --> 51:51.369
I wonder if we'll get any
sleep tonight.

51:51.412 --> 51:52.631
- Can you please let me down

51:52.674 --> 51:54.937
before Niagara Falls
pours all over my face?

51:57.157 --> 51:59.420
[fire crackling]

51:59.464 --> 52:00.291
- Whoa!

52:02.858 --> 52:04.599
We have now entered
Strangeville.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.124
- The pranks are getting better.

52:08.864 --> 52:10.083
I'm still not impressed.

52:13.565 --> 52:14.827
- Seems like they're
playing heavy

52:14.870 --> 52:17.569
into this whole Hangman theory.

52:17.612 --> 52:19.440
- They're just trying to
scare us to make us think

52:19.484 --> 52:21.877
we'll end up like those
other dead college kids.

52:21.921 --> 52:23.705
I choose to focus on
the winning.

52:23.749 --> 52:26.099
The rest is just
window dressing.

52:27.535 --> 52:30.016
- What if fate has something
else in store for you,

52:30.059 --> 52:31.278
you jerk off?

52:32.975 --> 52:36.327
- How do you know what your
fate's gonna be tomorrow?

52:36.370 --> 52:38.938
- All I know is our actions
determine what we get

52:38.981 --> 52:41.767
and what we deserve: Free will.

52:43.551 --> 52:47.686
- I believe we all follow a
path that's laid out for us.

52:47.729 --> 52:49.209
- Nobody cares what you believe.

52:50.645 --> 52:53.213
- If a good person dies
young, is that free will?

52:54.606 --> 52:55.389
- I don't know.

52:55.433 --> 52:57.652
I believe what I believe.

52:57.696 --> 53:01.221
- Look, it's getting late, and
we're gonna need all the rest

53:01.265 --> 53:03.354
we can get for tomorrow.

53:03.397 --> 53:06.661
God, I didn't drink that
much, but I am feeling it.

53:06.705 --> 53:07.619
Night.
- Good night.

53:10.839 --> 53:13.494
[zipper buzzes]

53:21.633 --> 53:22.547
Yeah, well,

53:24.897 --> 53:27.943
you two can have that tent.

53:27.987 --> 53:29.336
Good night.

53:29.380 --> 53:31.251
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:31.295 --> 53:33.949
I don't think that fate
has been decided yet.

53:33.993 --> 53:36.561
- Yeah, maybe not in your mind.

53:37.736 --> 53:40.217
- How about we flip for it?

53:41.261 --> 53:43.045
- How about we wrestle for it?

53:44.569 --> 53:47.267
- [Trevor] You're not the
one I'd like to wrestle with.

53:57.843 --> 53:58.800
- [Jenn] Who is it?

54:00.106 --> 54:02.369
- The other tent's full.

54:02.413 --> 54:03.762
And besides, I don't
think it's safe

54:03.805 --> 54:05.285
for you to sleep alone tonight.

54:08.984 --> 54:11.552
[zipper buzzes]

54:11.596 --> 54:14.207
- [Jenn] You can keep the
other side of the tent safe.

54:20.082 --> 54:22.563
[zipper buzzes]

54:23.303 --> 54:24.826
- Well, that's cool.

54:24.870 --> 54:27.742
I'll just wait out here and
wait for the fire to die out.

54:29.614 --> 54:30.397
- Good night.

54:33.139 --> 54:34.227
- Good night.

54:36.751 --> 54:39.450
[fire crackling]

54:43.628 --> 54:46.108
You remind me of my
cousin Shelby.

54:46.152 --> 54:48.241
- Is she a kissing cousin?

54:49.721 --> 54:52.637
I'm kidding, she must
be really cool.

54:53.638 --> 54:54.595
- Yeah, she is.

54:56.597 --> 54:57.990
And I was supposed to
see here this weekend

54:58.033 --> 54:59.470
at my parents' family reunion,

55:01.123 --> 55:02.777
but instead I'm here with you.

55:04.823 --> 55:06.215
- But you got stuck with me.

55:10.394 --> 55:11.569
- Things could be worse.

55:16.008 --> 55:18.837
- So, what does a guy like you

55:18.880 --> 55:21.318
need 25 grand to play with?

55:22.449 --> 55:24.103
- You think I'm an elitist.

55:24.146 --> 55:26.148
No, no, it's alright, a
lot of people do.

55:28.020 --> 55:28.847
Truth:

55:30.457 --> 55:31.806
I don't want my dad's money.

55:32.894 --> 55:34.113
I want his acceptance.

55:35.506 --> 55:37.943
I don't wanna live in my
brother's shadow anymore.

55:40.598 --> 55:41.555
With my dad, though,

55:43.949 --> 55:47.082
[scoffs] it's complicated.

55:48.170 --> 55:50.999
- Trust me, I know complicated.

55:53.959 --> 55:56.396
Almost lost it back there
when my flashlight died.

55:57.354 --> 56:00.008
- Yeah, but, you're alright now.

56:00.052 --> 56:03.360
- Yeah, thanks to your
mad cave man skills.

56:03.403 --> 56:05.971
- Yeah, well, I do everything
except for the grunting.

56:06.014 --> 56:07.538
[Jenn laughs]
No, I know how

56:07.581 --> 56:09.844
to handle myself in
the outdoors.

56:09.888 --> 56:12.369
But I have trouble with
other things.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.283
- Like what?

56:15.633 --> 56:18.026
I can't imagine you have
any problem with girls.

56:19.071 --> 56:20.464
- Just meeting the right one.

56:24.859 --> 56:28.080
Well, have you given any
more thought to our alliance?

56:29.473 --> 56:32.301
- Well, I know you and
Trevor won't be allies.

56:32.345 --> 56:34.565
- What? Me and Trevor?

56:34.608 --> 56:35.870
I love the guy,

56:35.914 --> 56:39.439
like a fungus or something.
[laughing]

56:41.746 --> 56:43.835
- Yeah, okay.

56:43.878 --> 56:45.576
I could go for an alliance.

56:46.533 --> 56:48.361
But the 25 K is all mine.

56:49.493 --> 56:51.146
- Okay, shake on it.

56:59.981 --> 57:02.636
[lips smacking]

57:06.161 --> 57:08.555
- Or kiss.

57:08.599 --> 57:10.296
Either way we'll seal the deal.

57:12.733 --> 57:13.778
- I'd really like to see you

57:13.821 --> 57:16.694
when we get back at school.
- Yeah.

57:17.695 --> 57:18.478
I'd like that.

57:21.873 --> 57:24.919
- Oh wow.
[laughing]

57:24.963 --> 57:27.269
It's the beers, they're
really kicking in.

57:28.706 --> 57:29.489
I'm tired.

57:30.708 --> 57:32.927
- Well, good luck tomorrow.

57:32.971 --> 57:34.625
At least enough to
come in second.

57:35.582 --> 57:38.019
- Yeah, good luck to you.

57:39.325 --> 57:40.848
- Night!
- Good night.

57:43.285 --> 57:47.115
[peaceful instrumental music]

57:49.291 --> 57:50.815
[zipper buzzes]

57:50.858 --> 57:53.992
- Who took my stuff?

57:54.035 --> 57:58.431
- Relax, you've never gotten
drunk and been markered before?

57:58.475 --> 58:00.651
- There's no way I was
that drunk last night.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.392
- I think we were drugged.

58:03.436 --> 58:05.264
You guys remember
feeling groggy?

58:05.307 --> 58:07.614
- So they could go
through our stuff.

58:07.658 --> 58:09.703
- [Trevor] Yup, upping
up the ante now.

58:09.747 --> 58:11.618
Cell phones are all gone, too.

58:11.662 --> 58:14.229
- And they took my clothes,
what the hell!

58:14.273 --> 58:17.145
- Oh, and we got this;

58:17.189 --> 58:20.279
Coordinates to our
first challenge.

58:20.322 --> 58:23.282
Says we gotta go that way.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.196
- Let me see it.

58:24.239 --> 58:25.806
- Hey, that's mine!
- Relax!

58:28.592 --> 58:30.419
No, we gotta go that way,
Magellan.

58:35.076 --> 58:35.903
Yeah.

58:38.819 --> 58:42.519
[ominous instrumental music]

59:22.428 --> 59:23.821
- [Jeff] Hey, watch out!

59:23.864 --> 59:26.084
[laughing]

59:33.831 --> 59:35.006
- Those are my clothes.

59:38.444 --> 59:39.663
This isn't funny.

59:41.665 --> 59:43.057
This isn't funny anymore!

59:43.101 --> 59:43.928
Do you hear me?

59:58.812 --> 01:00:02.511
[ominous instrumental music]

01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:17.744
Hello?

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:19.224
Is anyone here?

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:21.052
- This is definitely it.

01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:23.097
- I am not going in there.

01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:24.969
- What, giving up on the 25 G?

01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:27.972
- I'm already over these pranks.

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:30.235
- Hey, check it out.

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:33.107
Welcome to the first challenge.

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:36.110
Pick two players to
enter the Cave of Doom!

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:39.418
- [Jeff] That sounds ominous.

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:40.680
- Looks like they're
gonna lock us in.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.160
- Yeah, I'm staying out here.

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.079
- [Jeff] I'll go.

01:00:48.122 --> 01:00:50.342
- Alright, we got our
first volunteer.

01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:51.212
I'll go with you.

01:00:51.256 --> 01:00:53.824
- Hey, don't I get a vote?

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.652
You trying to steal
my prize money?

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:57.958
- Cam, enough!

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:02.006
- Why don't you just stay out
here and keep Jenn company?

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:02.920
Can you do that?

01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.444
- You know what?

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:06.880
That sounds like a good idea.

01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:11.363
[bag thuds]
- Let's go.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.721
- You know, I coulda taken him.

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.202
Lucky for him, my index
finger's my Achilles Heel.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:32.689
[ominous instrumental music]

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:37.694
So, Jenn, what brought you here?

01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:41.828
- What else, the money.

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:45.223
And I wanted to
challenge myself.

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:50.271
- What, living a life
of quiet desperation?

01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:51.272
- Aren't we all?

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.754
- And we all have a story.

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:55.624
What's yours?

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:03.067
- When my dad died, my mom
got very protective of us.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:06.766
She made us take walkie-talkies
to the grocery store

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.377
which was only two blocks away.

01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:12.990
And we'd have to hold hands
and talk to her the whole time.

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:14.165
It was so embarrassing.

01:02:15.427 --> 01:02:18.082
- Well, at least your mom cared.

01:02:18.996 --> 01:02:19.953
- She does.

01:02:22.477 --> 01:02:23.827
It's just time to move on.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:29.006
So why are you here?
- The cheese.

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:33.401
I'm tired of eating Ramen
noodles and cat food all day.

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.490
At least, I think it
was cat food.

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.927
- [laughs] Well, at
least you have two

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:39.059
of the four food groups.

01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:42.802
[ominous instrumental music]

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:49.069
[gate clatters]

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.376
- What, you scared?

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.812
It's just bamboo.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:58.775
Well, move along, my
fellow spelunker.

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:25.192
[ominous instrumental music]

01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:27.020
- That's it; dead end.

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:29.370
- [Cam] Now look, what's that?

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.243
Should I push the button?

01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:34.767
- [Jeff] Well, I mean, I
guess it's part of the game.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.029
- [Cam] Right?

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:36.856
Alright.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.903
- [Jeff] Wait, wait! [gasps]

01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:41.339
- The gate.

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:44.472
- So, when this thing wraps
up, how 'bout you and I

01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:45.909
connect for a drink later?

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:48.476
- I'm busy [sighs].

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:52.219
I knew this would happen.

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:53.742
- [Trevor] It's
probably nothing.

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:55.396
Maybe it's an elimination round.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.711
- [Jeff] What's it
counting down to?

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:07.191
- Hopefully opening the gate.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.195
- What the hell does boom mean?

01:04:11.238 --> 01:04:12.631
- Boom, a bomb.

01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:15.112
Like a stink bomb, like
in junior high.

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.853
Like, a liquid fart.

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.332
Let's just get out of here

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:20.291
'cause I don't wanna smell
like ass in front of Jenn.

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:22.684
- Before the countdown
reaches one minute,

01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:24.599
the button must be
pressed and held

01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:26.819
or the bomb explodes.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.777
- Bomb, see, like a stink bomb.

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:30.388
Let's just figure out a
way to get out of here.

01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:33.173
It's probably gotta be like
one of those room escape games,

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.479
you know, you play online?

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:38.048
- At 30 seconds, the
gate will open

01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:39.701
allowing one player free.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:43.227
[timer beeping]

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:50.974
The C4 will detonate at
the end of the countdown.

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:52.192
- C4?

01:04:52.236 --> 01:04:55.021
Like, I mean, well,
that's gotta be a prank.

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:59.721
- [Jeff] Thanks for
playing, College Prank Team.

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:04.596
- What the hell kind of
prank is that?

01:05:06.032 --> 01:05:08.339
- I don't know, but we have
less than three minutes.

01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:10.210
- Well, somebody's gotta
push the button then.

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:11.298
- You pressed it, not me.

01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:13.735
- No, we both
decided to push it.

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.085
- On what planet?

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:15.955
I said, wait.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.739
Both of us don't have to die.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:19.741
- [Cam] Fuck, fuck!

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:21.395
Ah, fuck!

01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:23.006
Alright, what do we do,
what do we do?

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.226
Oh man.

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.186
- It's not depressing the
button enough; it's too big.

01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:31.449
And these aren't heavy enough.

01:05:31.492 --> 01:05:32.667
- [Cam] Alright, alright.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:33.538
Look, okay,

01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:37.934
you should push the button.

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:39.370
I mean, you've already done
terrible things, right?

01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:41.067
You admitted it.

01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.460
- Who gave you the
right to play God?

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:44.549
- If you look at it from
a utilitarian standpoint,

01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:46.638
who's got more to offer society,
huh?

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.248
- That's bullshit!

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:50.163
You had everything
handed to you.

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.686
- [Cam] That doesn't
change the facts.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.905
- What facts?

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.341
If I'd of been in
the same place,

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:56.256
I would've done the
same or more!

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.389
- Well, that's not really
the issue now, is it?

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:02.132
- Every Saint has a past.

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:04.090
And every sinner has a future.

01:06:04.134 --> 01:06:05.135
You're still no Saint.

01:06:05.178 --> 01:06:06.745
- What?

01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:09.748
Look, we got one minute to push
this button or we both die.

01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:13.447
- I deserve to live!

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:14.666
- [Cam] Why's that?

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.755
- Because I believe in
God and you don't!

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.104
- I never said I don't
believe in God.

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:19.932
I just think we choose
our own fate.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:22.630
- How do you choose
your fate now?

01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:24.023
- I don't know.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.983
Look, I don't know, I can't
decide this on my own.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.246
Look, whoever set up
this death trap

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.770
wants one of us to decide
the fate for both of us.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.296
- [Jeff] So much for your
free will theory, huh?

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:41.214
- Look, we got 30 seconds
to push a button, huh?

01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:42.215
Or we both die.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:44.957
Who's it gonna be?

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.657
- [Trevor] So, if you and
I were the last two people

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:52.269
on earth because of a
natural disaster,

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.271
what would you think would
happen to the human race?

01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:58.275
- [Jenn] Humanity
probably wouldn't survive.

01:06:58.318 --> 01:07:01.495
[gate clicks]

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:02.366
Cam?

01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:11.592
[timer beeping]

01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.551
- [Cam] Get out of the way!

01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:14.421
Get down!

01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:18.208
[explosion booms]

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:21.385
- [laughs] What the fuck?

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.256
- Whoa, what the?

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.953
What just happened, dude?

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:28.000
- Is that a fucking bomb,
or what? [explosion booms]

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.176
[gasping]

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.272
- Where's Jeff?

01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:42.493
- This isn't a game anymore.

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.016
That was a real bomb in there.

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:54.635
[groaning]

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:55.984
- Trevor!

01:07:56.028 --> 01:07:56.855
Can you hear me?

01:07:58.117 --> 01:07:59.423
Are you okay?

01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:00.685
I don't get it; why are
they trying to kill us?

01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:01.773
- I don't know, okay?

01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:04.428
Alright, we gotta get him
to the hospital.

01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:06.560
And then we gotta call the
police. Come on, help him up.

01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:10.825
[ominous instrumental music]

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.089
[groaning]

01:08:16.743 --> 01:08:18.484
- We have to get him
down the mountain.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.444
- Yeah, but he's gotta be able
to walk; I can't carry him.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:22.924
Fuck.

01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:24.796
- Shit!

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:31.019
We are not playing anymore,
you fuckers!

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:34.545
- Alright, okay, it says there's
a marker right over there.

01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:35.633
Wait here, alright?

01:08:35.676 --> 01:08:37.678
Wait with Trevor, I'll
be right back.

01:08:39.376 --> 01:08:41.334
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:01.180
[sighs]

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:10.711
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:11.582
- Here.

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:14.279
Look.

[ominous instrumental music]

[screams]

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:32.298
- Jenny!

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:36.259
Jenny, you have to
finish the game!

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:40.305
If you don't continue,
they're gonna kill me!

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.787
Jenny, help me!
- Why are they doing this?

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:44.571
- [Jenny's Mom] Help me!

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:49.054
[Jenny's Mom screaming]
- Okay, I don't know.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:51.274
This is way off the reservation.

01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:52.362
- We need to get help.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.582
The cameras, the cameras.

01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:00.326
I got on the train at
Union Station.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:03.982
And I got off at--
[static crackles]

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:06.724
- Man, I don't know what the
fuck is going on right now.

01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:07.812
I don't know, man.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:09.596
[camera beeping]
- Goddamn it!

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.554
Goddamn it!

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.034
Alright.

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:17.517
Our coordinates are different.

01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:20.433
That means they want
us to split up.

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:25.177
Hey, Trevor?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.047
Trevor?

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:28.615
Can you hear me?

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:29.486
You there?

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:32.358
- What happened, where's Jeff?

01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:34.752
- He's dead.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.144
- [Trevor] And the money?

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:36.971
- No--

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:37.668
- [Trevor] I knew it.

01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:39.060
- Look, buddy,

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:41.628
we gotta leave you here
for a little bit, alright?

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.811
Alright, stop, it's not
too much further

01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:51.986
till we gotta split up.

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.651
What?
- My dad's picture.

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.220
It's gone!

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.569
- [Cam] It's just a picture,
right?

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:10.396
- No, it's,

01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:15.314
Trevor, I had it when we
were with Trevor.

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:17.664
- Okay, alright, look,
calm down!

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:20.537
We haven't gone very
far, let's just go back.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.364
- [Jenn] Fine.

01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:25.455
- I don't know, man.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:28.327

track the website feeds,

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:32.070
but they keep bouncing all
over the globe.

I don't know what the
fuck is going on, man.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:35.639
- Where's Trevor?

01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:40.557

I've never seen so much blood.

01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:09.673
I couldn't even make
anything out.

01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:13.198
- Trevor?

01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:20.031
Look at this.

01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:32.609
Let's get out of here.

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.838
What happened in the
cave with you and Jeff?

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:47.711
- He let me go.

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:51.976
- He gave his life for you.
- Yeah.

01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:54.761
I can't explain why.

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:01.986
- Mine say to go this way.

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:03.466
- Look, I don't think we
should split up.

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:04.684
- We have to.

01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:08.688
We have to follow the rules,
for my mom.

01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:14.041
- Be careful.

Cam, what are you doing?

01:15:21.734 --> 01:15:22.518
It's you!

01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:26.826
Why are you doing this?
- No, Jenn, no.

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:30.526
Jenn, I found the knife in
a box where they sent me.

01:15:35.095 --> 01:15:36.096
They're watching us.

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:38.795
Somewhere.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:43.887
What did you find?

[box clatters]

01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:57.640
Inside you'll find two
syringes filled with rohypnol.

01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:02.732
What's rohypnol?
- They want us knocked out.

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:06.170
- Are you kidding me?

01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:11.697
I'm not fucking injecting
myself with that shit.

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:12.568
- Keep reading.

01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:23.274
- You have five minutes
to inject each other.

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:26.494
If you're still awake
after that time,

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.890
your mother dies.

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:38.811
Do you really think,
if we inject ourselves,

01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:40.770
then we get to walk out
of this alive?

01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:42.554
- I don't know.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.903
But what choice do we have?

01:16:45.209 --> 01:16:46.384
- We've all got choices.

01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:49.256
Life is a game of choices,

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.606
and we're playing the
game right now.

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:56.307
we get the cops, we come
back up here--

- No, time is running out

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.093

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:03.706
- Okay.

01:17:05.882 --> 01:17:09.189
I said I would be here for
you and your mom, remember?

01:17:12.845 --> 01:17:14.542
- I have to follow the rules.

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.461

is decide what's right.

And I can help you with that.

that from you in one second?

- Cam? [gasping]

01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:55.676
I'm in a coffin; they
buried my alive.

- Same.

01:21:02.814 --> 01:21:06.035
- Cam, I saw him.

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:08.254
I saw the Hangman.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:10.387
- [Hangman] Good evening,
players.

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:13.912
Welcome to the last stage
of the game: Final Prank.

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:19.875
It's my honor to facilitate
such an exciting finale.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:21.920
So here are the rules:

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:25.402
Both of you have 10
minutes of air.

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:28.753
Both of you are six
feet underground.

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:32.496
You must answer three questions
right to survive the game.

01:21:33.758 --> 01:21:36.413
A correct answer takes
away two minutes

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:37.980
away from your opponent.

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:39.416
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:21:40.547 --> 01:21:41.984
- [Hangman] Better
save your breath.

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:43.768
Because the
countdown begins now.

01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:47.772
First question, let's
see how well

01:21:47.815 --> 01:21:49.339
you know your fellow players.

01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:52.211
Not everybody comes from money

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:53.952
like daddy's boy, Cameron.

01:21:55.736 --> 01:21:57.216
Some of us didn't get the choice

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.957
of the best possible college.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.308
What college did Trevor attend?

01:22:02.352 --> 01:22:03.962
- Fuck you!

01:22:04.006 --> 01:22:05.746
Fuck you, what kind of
question is that?

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.707
- Why are you doing this to us?
[sobs]

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.056
- [Hangman] Take your time.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:14.451
What little you have.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:20.109
- Worton, he went to
Worton College.

01:22:20.152 --> 01:22:22.285
- [Hangman] Excellent,
Cam, you are correct.

01:22:23.242 --> 01:22:24.243
Next question:

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:29.292
Which one of your fellow
players is a true murderer?

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:33.339
- You're the only murderer here!

01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:36.864
- [Hangman] Now, now, Jenn,
be truthful.

01:22:36.908 --> 01:22:38.649
I've read your diary.

01:22:41.043 --> 01:22:42.783
- [Cam] Jenn, what's he
talking about?

01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:45.047
- How long have you
been following us?

01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:50.487
- [Hangman] Tick-tock,
time's a wasting.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.358
Who is the real killer here?

01:22:52.402 --> 01:22:54.752
- You are, Trevor, you are!

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.581
So give it up already,
you hear me?

01:23:00.366 --> 01:23:01.193
- I am.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.067
I'm the murderer.

01:23:06.807 --> 01:23:08.940
[sobbing]

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.768
- [Cam] Jenn, what
are you saying?

01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.248
- [Hangman] Points for honesty.

01:23:12.291 --> 01:23:14.032
And Cam loses two
minutes of oxygen.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:18.602
And we're tied going into
the last stage of the game.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:23.302
As a bonus, I'm gonna
take away three minutes

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:26.523
from the loser.
- You worthless piece of shit!

01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:28.133
I hope you rot in hell!

01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:31.745
- [Hangman] Final question:

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.794
Which one of you
deserves to live?

01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:41.668
- Damn you! [sobbing]

01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:45.411
- Jenn.

01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:47.979
Jenn does.
- Cam, no!

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:50.416
- [Hangman] I
underestimated you, Cameron.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:54.551
That's very noble of you.

01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:58.207
- Cam, you shouldn't have.

01:24:00.513 --> 01:24:01.297
- [sobs] Jenn,

01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:07.216
Jeff saved me earlier, and now,
well,

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:12.308
you got a lot more to lose.

01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:18.401
Jenn, take good care of
your mom, okay?

01:24:19.706 --> 01:24:21.056
- [Hangman] Loved ones,

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:26.931
your fate has been sealed by
the passing of your loved ones.

01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:31.979
I'm sure you'd like
an explanation.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.462
But I'd rather you die

01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:39.335
wondering why.

01:24:42.381 --> 01:24:45.993
And Cam, think about
how you got here.

01:24:46.037 --> 01:24:48.257
Who's choice really was it?

01:24:49.736 --> 01:24:51.869
I bid you adieu.

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:53.523
- [Cam] Fuck you, just
let me out of here

01:24:53.566 --> 01:24:55.133
for one fucking minute.

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:56.961
- No, no, Cam, don't.

01:24:57.004 --> 01:24:59.659
Save your air, you don't
have a lot of time [sobbing].

01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:03.663
- Mother fucker!

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:05.883
You know,

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:14.109
I shoulda gone to my
family reunion instead.

01:25:15.806 --> 01:25:16.459
- Yeah,

01:25:17.721 --> 01:25:20.680
so you could be with your
cousin, Shelby.

01:25:22.465 --> 01:25:23.248
- And my dad,

01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:27.470
he really goes all out
for these things.

01:25:27.513 --> 01:25:28.775
You should come next time.

01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:35.304
- Yeah, I'd like that.

01:25:36.827 --> 01:25:38.176
And I'll bring my mom.

01:25:40.657 --> 01:25:42.180
- I hope she likes Italian.

01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:45.314
- She loves it.

01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:53.409
- We'll have a really good time.

01:25:59.545 --> 01:26:00.372
- Cam?

01:26:04.202 --> 01:26:06.813
[gasping]

01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:09.294
- I feel like I'm under water.

01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:11.166
- Cam?

01:26:12.123 --> 01:26:14.256
[gasping]

01:26:19.522 --> 01:26:20.349
Cam?

Cam?

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.009

01:26:37.975 --> 01:26:38.802

Cam?

01:26:45.069 --> 01:26:48.203
[sobbing] Cam?

01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:50.379

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:56.211
[groaning]

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:04.044
No, no! [sobbing]

01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:04.915
No!

01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:09.136
[sobbing]

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.007
No!

01:27:13.358 --> 01:27:15.491

01:27:16.622 --> 01:27:19.103
[air hissing]

01:27:48.306 --> 01:27:49.394
- This is how it's gonna be,
huh?

01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:50.874
This is how it's gonna
fucking be, okay,

01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:52.441
every goddamn time.

01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:53.355
- Fucking liar!

01:27:53.398 --> 01:27:54.225
- Every fucking time.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.574
Every time you pull this shit.

01:27:55.618 --> 01:27:57.315
[Mother shrieking]
No, I'm fucking over this.

01:27:57.359 --> 01:27:59.186
I'm fucking over this.

01:28:04.235 --> 01:28:06.716
[engine revs]

01:28:09.196 --> 01:28:12.939
- [Mother] Really, you're
such a fucking liar.

01:28:20.904 --> 01:28:25.343
[ominous instrumental music]

01:28:25.387 --> 01:28:26.431
- Oh, my God!

01:28:38.182 --> 01:28:41.185
[crickets chirping]

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:50.194
[ominous instrumental music]

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:02.249
- [Hangman] Good evening, Jenn.

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:04.774
Welcome to the final good bye.

01:29:06.645 --> 01:29:07.994
- [gasping] Who are you?

01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:11.868
- [Hangman] Your fate,
or destiny.

01:29:13.217 --> 01:29:16.481
Whatever you'd like to call me.

01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:17.395
- And Jeff?

01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:20.267
And Trevor?

01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:22.269
What did you do to them?

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.883
[ominous instrumental music]

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.367
Jeff?

01:29:34.325 --> 01:29:37.589
I thought you were--
- A martyr?

01:29:37.633 --> 01:29:38.416
A fool?

01:29:43.247 --> 01:29:44.074
An orphan?

01:29:48.774 --> 01:29:49.558
I wasn't always.

01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:53.126
You see, my mother,

01:29:54.563 --> 01:29:57.479
she had a social worker
who helped her find a job.

01:29:59.742 --> 01:30:02.875
Your father, Peter Maddux.

01:30:07.837 --> 01:30:08.620
He helped her.

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:12.798
More than he should have.

01:30:15.453 --> 01:30:16.933
They started having an affair.

01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:20.458
But you already know that part.

01:30:21.633 --> 01:30:23.330
Your diary was very
illuminating.

01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:28.945
I just though he'd hit
her that night

01:30:28.988 --> 01:30:30.729
and left her die on the
side of the road

01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:32.905
like some wild animal!

01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:35.865
But now we know better.

01:30:37.344 --> 01:30:42.219
- Cameron, you killed Trevor
and him because of me?

01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:44.656
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:30:46.528 --> 01:30:50.270
Fate decided to intervene
in more than one way.

01:30:52.142 --> 01:30:52.969
Cam

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.452
was my half brother.
- You're crazy!

01:30:58.975 --> 01:31:00.063
- Doubt if you knew it,

01:31:01.934 --> 01:31:02.761
but Conrad,

01:31:05.155 --> 01:31:05.982
our father,

01:31:08.027 --> 01:31:08.854
he did,

01:31:11.204 --> 01:31:12.597
he doesn't even know my name!

01:31:15.557 --> 01:31:19.691
And Cam had the life
I shoulda had.

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:23.521
- Why kill your brother?

01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:29.571
- So my father would know
the heartbreak and torture

01:31:29.614 --> 01:31:30.963
of losing part of his family!

01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:36.708
- Well maybe if your mother
wasn't sleeping around with--

01:31:36.752 --> 01:31:37.622
- Don't you

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:41.060
speak of her like that.

01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:46.196
[sighs]

01:31:57.337 --> 01:31:58.164
- My mom,

01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:00.297
why?

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:04.997
- Simple:

01:32:06.477 --> 01:32:07.522
You took my mother,

01:32:09.393 --> 01:32:10.350
I took yours.

01:32:12.091 --> 01:32:13.136
Eye for an eye.

01:32:15.312 --> 01:32:16.269
And as you can see,

01:32:18.141 --> 01:32:20.360
she makes a great stand in.

01:32:20.404 --> 01:32:22.972
[Jenn sobbing]

01:32:29.587 --> 01:32:32.198
Choices have their consequences.

01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:37.377
Not to say I didn't
lead you a bit.

01:32:39.423 --> 01:32:41.686
You and Cam.

01:32:43.383 --> 01:32:46.343
The writings on the
mirror, the car trouble.

01:32:50.129 --> 01:32:52.567
He was just as money hungry.

01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:58.398
And Trevor, what about him?

01:32:58.442 --> 01:33:02.098
Lo and behold, who's face
popped up on our website,

01:33:02.141 --> 01:33:03.839
other than our good friend,
Trevor?

01:33:05.318 --> 01:33:07.843
Talk about predetermination.

01:33:07.886 --> 01:33:11.107
When I was in middle
school he used to carry

01:33:12.282 --> 01:33:16.068
a double-sided quarter,
both heads.

01:33:16.112 --> 01:33:18.767
And he'd say, "I'm
giving you a choice

01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:20.812
"by flipping this coin."

01:33:20.856 --> 01:33:25.643
But he'd choose heads first,
every time.

01:33:25.687 --> 01:33:29.995
So I gave him a
choice I never had:

01:33:30.039 --> 01:33:34.043
A true blue, 50/50,

01:33:34.086 --> 01:33:37.612
and he chose heads, like always.

01:33:40.092 --> 01:33:41.006
He chose poorly.

01:33:44.096 --> 01:33:46.795
[knife squishes]

01:33:49.232 --> 01:33:52.801
[ominous instrumental music]

01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:54.846
I had more plans for Trevor,

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:56.718
but after he got hurt
outside of the cave--

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:58.894
[gasping]

01:34:02.854 --> 01:34:05.901
- You are a coward
and a hypocrite.

01:34:07.206 --> 01:34:08.033
- Agreed.

01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:14.083
- You think you can play
with other peoples' lives?

01:34:16.955 --> 01:34:18.043
- What's done is done.

01:34:19.175 --> 01:34:20.002
Our paths are set.

01:34:21.307 --> 01:34:23.135
I'm in God's hands now.
- No.

01:34:24.441 --> 01:34:25.660
You're in mine.

01:34:27.139 --> 01:34:28.445
Up!
- Very appropriate.

01:34:29.925 --> 01:34:33.798
Indeed, you're finally
learning how to play the game.

01:34:36.975 --> 01:34:39.021
I'll tell you what,
I'll make it easy.

01:34:49.509 --> 01:34:51.773
[laughing]

01:34:51.816 --> 01:34:54.297
Looks like God has
the final prank.

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:56.734

[sobbing]

01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:27.547
- [Maggie] That's a crazy story.

01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:28.766
- Right?

01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:30.725
- So, some kid created a
fake reality show

01:35:30.768 --> 01:35:32.770
just to get these guys
up here that he hated,

01:35:32.814 --> 01:35:34.032
so he could kill them?

01:35:34.076 --> 01:35:35.425
- Yes!

01:35:35.468 --> 01:35:37.079
- There's no way that's true.

01:35:37.122 --> 01:35:40.038
- [Maggie] It's ridiculous.

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.387
- What the fuck?

01:35:43.128 --> 01:35:45.609
- Come on, man, what is
this? Did you set this up?

01:35:45.652 --> 01:35:46.479
- No.

[ominous instrumental music]

01:35:53.878 --> 01:35:54.923
- Maggie, you must
have set this up?

01:35:54.966 --> 01:35:56.751
- No, I didn't, I swear.

01:36:01.364 --> 01:36:02.191
- Alright then.

01:36:03.888 --> 01:36:04.715
I'm just gonna go kick his ass.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:06.238
- Come on, don't go out there.

01:36:06.282 --> 01:36:08.588
Just turn around.
- Jack, get back in the car!

01:36:09.415 --> 01:36:12.070
[door clatters]

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.293

01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:19.034
Oh, my God!

01:36:19.077 --> 01:36:20.122
Oh, my God!

01:36:20.165 --> 01:36:21.427
- Holy shit!

01:36:21.471 --> 01:36:22.472
Maggie, get in the back seat!

Oh, my God!
