00:44.136 --> 00:47.060
There is a place.

00:47.216 --> 00:50.381
A place that knows no sadness.

00:50.976 --> 00:55.143
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.

00:55.816 --> 01:01.500
A place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high.

01:02.256 --> 01:08.103
It lies deep in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond a medieval village.

01:08.176 --> 01:11.144
Most people believe this place is made up,

01:11.216 --> 01:15.624
only to be found in books
or in children's imaginations.

01:15.695 --> 01:18.544
Well, we beg to differ.

01:19.536 --> 01:22.101
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

01:24.975 --> 01:27.136
I'm going in!

01:28.654 --> 01:31.535
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

01:31.694 --> 01:33.102
Yes!

01:34.376 --> 01:40.823
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

01:42.054 --> 01:44.258
Oh, yeah! So excited!

01:51.534 --> 01:54.982
Now you see us, now you don't!

01:55.054 --> 01:58.262
Three, two, one. Yeah!

02:12.333 --> 02:16.173
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

02:27.932 --> 02:30.093
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!

02:30.214 --> 02:35.058
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf
plays their own special pad.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.542
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

02:37.613 --> 02:40.582
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

02:40.653 --> 02:42.932
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.

02:43.052 --> 02:45.213
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

02:45.294 --> 02:47.662
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!

02:47.734 --> 02:50.133
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

02:50.252 --> 02:52.533
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

02:52.653 --> 02:56.374
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

02:56.653 --> 02:58.856
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

02:58.933 --> 03:01.497
Clumsy! Help!

03:02.772 --> 03:06.700
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

03:07.653 --> 03:08.897
Smurf on the loose!

03:08.972 --> 03:10.216
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

03:10.292 --> 03:11.852
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.576
Who's clumsy now, huh?

03:14.692 --> 03:17.453
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

03:17.933 --> 03:21.217
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

03:21.292 --> 03:23.540
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

03:23.652 --> 03:25.452
But, wait! I...

03:29.411 --> 03:30.896
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

03:31.012 --> 03:32.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

03:32.931 --> 03:35.376
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

03:35.492 --> 03:37.815
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

03:37.931 --> 03:39.536
Grouchy, it's right there.

03:39.691 --> 03:43.051
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

03:43.211 --> 03:45.459
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

03:45.571 --> 03:47.535
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

03:47.651 --> 03:49.134
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

03:49.250 --> 03:52.775
the other Smurfs don't want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called

03:52.970 --> 03:54.695
"fractures."

03:55.492 --> 03:58.296
How could anybody think that?

03:58.891 --> 04:00.658
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

04:02.571 --> 04:06.892
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.

04:07.690 --> 04:09.610
Watch it, there!

04:10.891 --> 04:15.212
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

04:16.010 --> 04:19.218
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

04:19.329 --> 04:23.018
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

04:23.090 --> 04:27.891
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

04:28.011 --> 04:32.255
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

04:32.330 --> 04:35.374
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

04:35.889 --> 04:39.490
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

04:39.730 --> 04:43.658
La la la la la la
This is so wrong

04:43.890 --> 04:45.615
"I'm Papa Smurf.

04:45.730 --> 04:48.249
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people

04:48.329 --> 04:52.529
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

04:53.170 --> 04:56.650
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

04:56.769 --> 05:00.217
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

05:00.329 --> 05:02.969
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

05:03.049 --> 05:05.733
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

05:09.610 --> 05:12.336
But all of that is about to change.

05:18.089 --> 05:22.617
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

05:22.729 --> 05:24.737
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

05:24.808 --> 05:27.688
in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.216
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.015
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

05:33.888 --> 05:36.409
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

05:36.488 --> 05:39.128
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

05:39.207 --> 05:41.456
every single minute of every single day.

05:42.128 --> 05:43.568
'Cause I need them!

05:43.687 --> 05:47.615
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

05:47.688 --> 05:51.169
that my magic will finally become...

05:52.328 --> 05:53.452
Not infallible.

05:54.607 --> 05:57.128
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

05:57.248 --> 06:01.776
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

06:10.847 --> 06:13.412
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

06:13.486 --> 06:14.653
"O great one?"

06:14.726 --> 06:17.770
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

06:17.927 --> 06:22.248
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

06:22.567 --> 06:24.935
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

06:25.007 --> 06:27.494
For, you see, I have a magical map

06:27.567 --> 06:30.087
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows!

06:30.208 --> 06:34.736
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

06:36.207 --> 06:38.574
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

06:38.766 --> 06:40.294
Alakazoop!

06:43.207 --> 06:44.527
Great.

06:45.726 --> 06:48.488
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

06:49.807 --> 06:52.295
We really need that Smurf essence.

06:52.367 --> 06:53.654
Alakazamp!

06:57.566 --> 06:59.094
Now tie it off right there!

06:59.207 --> 07:02.612
That blue moon time of year again.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.010
Time to smurf some magic.

07:05.126 --> 07:08.607
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

07:08.686 --> 07:11.774
I must get the visioning potion just right.

07:11.846 --> 07:14.727
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

07:15.966 --> 07:19.654
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

07:19.725 --> 07:22.933
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

07:24.124 --> 07:26.405
A dragon wand.

07:26.885 --> 07:29.646
I got it! I got it!

07:30.366 --> 07:31.686
Clumsy.

07:34.365 --> 07:37.333
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

07:40.965 --> 07:42.286
Papa!

07:42.925 --> 07:45.849
Clumsy, what have you done?

07:45.925 --> 07:48.805
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

07:49.244 --> 07:50.412
Are you okay?

07:50.565 --> 07:53.368
Yes. Fine.

07:53.445 --> 07:55.845
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

07:56.204 --> 07:58.769
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

07:58.885 --> 08:01.045
so I thought I'd make
some smurf root mud packs

08:01.124 --> 08:04.212
to take down everyone's swelling.

08:05.245 --> 08:08.048
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.

08:08.324 --> 08:11.685
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

08:11.805 --> 08:13.126
I'll get the smurf root.

08:13.245 --> 08:16.244
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

08:16.324 --> 08:19.848
Okay. If you say so.

08:20.363 --> 08:25.612
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

08:28.004 --> 08:30.449
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

08:30.564 --> 08:34.764
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

08:35.643 --> 08:37.772
Let's see, just a few more...

08:41.284 --> 08:42.931
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

08:46.084 --> 08:47.371
Help!

08:47.843 --> 08:50.091
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

08:50.243 --> 08:51.530
A ball of yarn!

08:51.643 --> 08:53.564
A nice, juicy bird!

08:57.123 --> 08:58.890
So, that's it!

09:00.763 --> 09:02.083
It's invisible.

09:02.881 --> 09:05.130
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:06.042 --> 09:08.171
We don't know if it's safe.

09:13.282 --> 09:14.722
Azrael?

09:16.322 --> 09:18.569
Are you dead?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.610
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

09:22.722 --> 09:26.323
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

09:26.402 --> 09:28.007
Everything's going to be just fine.

09:28.322 --> 09:31.607
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

09:31.682 --> 09:34.408
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

09:34.562 --> 09:37.606
No, no! Gargamel!

09:38.401 --> 09:40.682
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

09:41.762 --> 09:43.562
Gargamel!

09:44.642 --> 09:46.321
Smurf for your lives!

09:46.401 --> 09:48.321
Everybody skedaddle!

09:50.921 --> 09:52.602
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

09:52.681 --> 09:54.841
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

09:54.921 --> 09:56.809
This is really bad!

09:56.921 --> 09:58.208
Smurfs, that way!

09:58.720 --> 10:01.121
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

10:02.121 --> 10:05.122
There you go, you nasty cat.

10:05.641 --> 10:07.322
- This way!
- This is no joke!

10:07.402 --> 10:09.006
- Look out!
- Papa!

10:21.160 --> 10:23.364
Let go! Cursed nature!

10:28.640 --> 10:31.041
Here comes papa, Papa!

10:33.960 --> 10:39.242
Papa, your primitive little defenses,
they're useless against me, sir!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.527
I laugh at them.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.963
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

10:53.599 --> 10:54.843
Maybe this will all blow over.

10:54.919 --> 10:57.286
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.487
Yes!

10:58.720 --> 11:00.084
Follow me, everyone!

11:02.400 --> 11:04.167
Save yourselves!

11:04.519 --> 11:06.919
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

11:07.039 --> 11:09.406
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

11:09.479 --> 11:12.043
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

11:12.160 --> 11:14.648
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

11:14.719 --> 11:16.486
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

11:16.559 --> 11:19.244
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

11:19.318 --> 11:21.567
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

11:21.639 --> 11:23.482
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

11:23.558 --> 11:25.041
This is not good at all.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.363
Clumsy!

11:32.959 --> 11:34.160
Help!

11:34.239 --> 11:35.602
Well, we tried. Let's go.

11:35.678 --> 11:38.527
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.038
Not the Smurf bridge!

11:40.679 --> 11:42.479
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

11:42.559 --> 11:45.124
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

11:45.199 --> 11:47.043
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

11:47.399 --> 11:49.407
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

11:49.478 --> 11:52.042
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

11:52.158 --> 11:53.325
Oh, no!

11:53.439 --> 11:55.761
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

11:55.838 --> 11:57.847
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

11:59.518 --> 12:02.442
- Don't let go!
- Help!

12:02.798 --> 12:03.844
Help!

12:04.238 --> 12:05.722
Look out for the hole!

12:05.797 --> 12:08.482
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.

12:08.559 --> 12:10.282
Smurf up! It's a hole.

12:11.837 --> 12:14.478
Hold on!

12:15.677 --> 12:16.922
Oh, no!

12:16.998 --> 12:20.479
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

12:20.798 --> 12:23.558
Now you belong to me!

12:24.038 --> 12:26.285
Not this time, Gargamel!

12:46.236 --> 12:47.316
What's wrong with you?

12:47.395 --> 12:51.279
That was great! Let's have another go.

12:51.357 --> 12:54.040
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!

12:54.116 --> 12:55.361
We're not even wet.

12:55.437 --> 12:58.164
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

12:58.236 --> 13:00.080
My calculations indicate...

13:01.116 --> 13:02.120
That's slimy.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.280
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

13:05.356 --> 13:06.644
Oh, my.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.241
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

13:12.636 --> 13:16.204
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

13:16.315 --> 13:17.603
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

13:17.675 --> 13:20.643
And can't we just go around the rock?

13:24.795 --> 13:28.200
Oh, my smurf.

13:28.515 --> 13:30.042
Where the smurf are we?

13:30.115 --> 13:33.999
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

13:34.076 --> 13:35.920
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.323
Oh, yeah. Really?

13:39.396 --> 13:41.120
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

13:41.195 --> 13:42.440
- Run!
- Not again!

13:42.876 --> 13:46.400
Azrael? Are you dead?

13:51.555 --> 13:55.276
Must have Smurfs!

13:59.914 --> 14:01.638
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

14:01.755 --> 14:03.360
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

14:03.436 --> 14:05.235
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

14:05.315 --> 14:07.715
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.438
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

14:09.514 --> 14:12.482
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

14:13.274 --> 14:16.362
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

14:16.475 --> 14:18.320
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

14:18.396 --> 14:21.604
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

14:21.675 --> 14:22.755
Also, don't forget to smile.

14:23.035 --> 14:25.916
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.002
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

14:28.074 --> 14:30.639
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

14:30.714 --> 14:32.154
Hello, Henri.

14:32.234 --> 14:33.915
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

14:33.994 --> 14:35.041
Well, as much as I can be.

14:35.234 --> 14:37.515
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

14:37.594 --> 14:39.077
Patrick!

14:41.793 --> 14:44.313
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

14:45.434 --> 14:48.521
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

14:48.673 --> 14:50.474
It's gonna be quite the gala.

14:50.553 --> 14:55.081
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

14:55.393 --> 14:57.674
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

14:57.754 --> 15:00.962
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

15:01.314 --> 15:03.113
Can you give me what I want?

15:03.193 --> 15:04.633
Is that what you're asking for?

15:04.714 --> 15:07.833
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

15:07.913 --> 15:10.837
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

15:10.914 --> 15:14.438
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

15:14.553 --> 15:18.121
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.793
Odile, that's two days.

15:21.353 --> 15:24.354
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

15:24.473 --> 15:26.992
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

15:27.073 --> 15:28.873
But... No, two days is perfect.

15:28.953 --> 15:30.600
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

15:30.872 --> 15:33.960
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

15:39.392 --> 15:41.673
Where are we, Azrael?

15:44.153 --> 15:47.272
What manner of freakish realm is this?

15:50.072 --> 15:52.516
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

15:52.632 --> 15:54.279
Yes, yes, of course.

15:54.393 --> 15:56.193
This day just keeps getting better and better.

15:56.313 --> 15:59.116
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

15:59.192 --> 16:00.481
and everybody's happy, right?

16:00.553 --> 16:02.680
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

16:02.752 --> 16:04.913
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

16:04.991 --> 16:06.192
We're all gonna die.

16:06.271 --> 16:09.512
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

16:09.592 --> 16:12.113
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

16:12.192 --> 16:13.916
the portal will open again.

16:13.992 --> 16:15.837
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

16:15.992 --> 16:17.596
All right, let's get smurfing.

16:17.671 --> 16:19.680
Okay, but I'm not happy.

16:20.390 --> 16:21.634
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

16:21.751 --> 16:22.951
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

16:23.031 --> 16:25.431
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

16:27.711 --> 16:30.231
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

16:33.110 --> 16:34.233
Way to go, Smurfette!

16:35.591 --> 16:37.914
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

16:37.991 --> 16:39.355
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

16:39.511 --> 16:40.799
Smurf!

16:42.791 --> 16:44.831
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

16:45.429 --> 16:46.870
Hey.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.477
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.031
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

16:52.150 --> 16:53.917
Why don't we just go around the tree?

16:55.350 --> 16:56.790
There you are. By all means,

16:56.949 --> 17:00.397
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.071
What? Where?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.630
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.914
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

17:07.351 --> 17:08.397
Be careful, Brainy.

17:09.189 --> 17:10.357
Hey. Hey!

17:10.430 --> 17:12.317
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

17:12.789 --> 17:14.034
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

17:14.109 --> 17:16.313
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

17:16.388 --> 17:17.676
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

17:17.750 --> 17:20.390
A jump from this height
will Knock the blue out of us!

17:20.470 --> 17:21.833
- My hip.
- Papa!

17:21.910 --> 17:23.077
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

17:23.190 --> 17:24.477
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

17:25.030 --> 17:26.558
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

17:26.630 --> 17:28.997
Stop that carriage!

17:29.308 --> 17:30.389
Never mind. Here it is.

17:31.069 --> 17:32.477
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

17:32.629 --> 17:34.638
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

17:34.710 --> 17:35.910
Smurfs!

17:44.828 --> 17:46.389
Oh, wow.

17:51.349 --> 17:53.750
Castles and palaces everywhere!

17:53.909 --> 17:56.712
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

17:57.589 --> 17:59.836
And look at the giant princess!

18:01.630 --> 18:04.553
This village is amazing, Papa.

18:04.629 --> 18:07.269
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

18:07.349 --> 18:09.597
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

18:09.668 --> 18:13.356
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

18:13.428 --> 18:15.391
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.

18:15.508 --> 18:16.555
You can count on us, Papa.

18:17.348 --> 18:18.875
They can see us! Camouflage.

18:19.507 --> 18:21.427
Blend in.

18:34.187 --> 18:36.391
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.912
We get to climb another tree.

18:38.986 --> 18:41.355
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

18:41.427 --> 18:42.955
- Brainy.
- That's it.

18:43.787 --> 18:46.907
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

18:46.987 --> 18:49.552
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

18:49.627 --> 18:51.787
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

18:51.866 --> 18:54.311
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

18:54.386 --> 18:56.274
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

18:56.347 --> 18:58.714
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

19:00.228 --> 19:01.395
- Grace?
- Hello?

19:01.467 --> 19:03.867
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

19:05.067 --> 19:07.630
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

19:07.706 --> 19:10.271
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

19:11.947 --> 19:12.994
Baby kicked.

19:15.186 --> 19:16.387
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:16.627 --> 19:17.706
Please say hello.

19:26.586 --> 19:28.070
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

19:28.827 --> 19:31.074
This is the sound of my voice.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.990
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

19:35.626 --> 19:37.634
Hello.

19:38.225 --> 19:40.790
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

19:40.986 --> 19:43.310
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.

19:43.387 --> 19:45.427
Or the new VP of marketing.

19:45.866 --> 19:49.390
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

19:49.465 --> 19:50.512
- It's...
- It's provisional.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.506
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

19:53.586 --> 19:56.630
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

19:56.906 --> 19:59.034
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

19:59.105 --> 20:00.588
But I have two days.

20:00.905 --> 20:02.705
- Yikes.
- I know.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.792
What if I don't get them done in time?

20:04.864 --> 20:06.752
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.

20:09.145 --> 20:10.509
Unless...

20:10.585 --> 20:13.345
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

20:13.425 --> 20:16.152
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

20:19.424 --> 20:22.545
Azrael, we've come so far,

20:22.625 --> 20:26.630
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

20:27.105 --> 20:30.586
How to find the Smurfs?

20:31.265 --> 20:32.988
If only I...

20:33.383 --> 20:36.952
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

20:37.264 --> 20:41.192
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

20:41.664 --> 20:46.389
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

20:49.464 --> 20:51.384
Very nice. Are you done now?

20:51.624 --> 20:52.791
I don't want to look at it.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.027
What? What?

20:58.104 --> 21:02.665
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

21:02.944 --> 21:04.471
It is.

21:05.344 --> 21:08.704
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

21:09.984 --> 21:16.824
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.

21:17.424 --> 21:20.631
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

21:23.104 --> 21:25.908
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

21:27.263 --> 21:30.744
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

21:30.863 --> 21:34.190
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

21:35.663 --> 21:41.228
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

21:46.383 --> 21:50.464
Yes. It's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

21:52.341 --> 21:54.545
It's even got its own cauldron.

21:56.902 --> 21:58.429
What died in here?

21:59.742 --> 22:01.946
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

22:06.302 --> 22:10.623
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.906
What is that?

22:37.181 --> 22:38.665
On, baby.

22:40.061 --> 22:42.941
Daddy is home.

22:45.262 --> 22:46.625
Come on.

22:46.701 --> 22:50.105
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

22:50.181 --> 22:51.981
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

22:52.061 --> 22:56.589
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.

22:56.661 --> 23:00.382
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

23:00.461 --> 23:01.988
Hey, I think I see something up there.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.224
Oh, no.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.540
Clumsy? Is that you?

23:44.099 --> 23:45.146
Hello.

23:46.619 --> 23:48.659
Help! Help!

23:54.259 --> 23:55.819
Oh, smurf.

24:05.298 --> 24:06.739
Hey.

24:07.059 --> 24:08.903
"Berry Boom."

24:33.538 --> 24:34.705
Patrick!

24:51.538 --> 24:53.458
Elway. Elway.

24:53.538 --> 24:56.025
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

24:56.098 --> 24:57.342
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

24:57.418 --> 24:58.465
What is it?

25:01.337 --> 25:02.384
No, no!

25:02.898 --> 25:05.986
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.618
Elway.

25:08.097 --> 25:11.218
Elway. Did you do that?

25:11.777 --> 25:13.425
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

25:13.498 --> 25:15.221
- I got this side.
- All together now.

25:15.297 --> 25:16.858
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

25:18.777 --> 25:20.261
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

25:20.338 --> 25:21.942
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

25:22.018 --> 25:24.538
GO! Pull the lid!

25:29.936 --> 25:31.103
Gross.

25:35.816 --> 25:36.983
This is so...

25:52.776 --> 25:55.262
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

25:55.616 --> 25:57.460
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

25:57.536 --> 25:58.583
Excuse me. Pardon me.

25:58.654 --> 26:00.663
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

26:01.016 --> 26:02.695
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

26:03.095 --> 26:05.179
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

26:08.535 --> 26:09.582
Did you just talk?

26:09.815 --> 26:13.262
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

26:13.335 --> 26:14.743
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

26:14.816 --> 26:16.344
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

26:16.416 --> 26:18.183
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

26:18.255 --> 26:20.022
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

26:20.095 --> 26:21.459
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

26:21.895 --> 26:23.903
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

26:24.255 --> 26:26.863
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

26:26.935 --> 26:28.178
Kiss my smurf!

26:28.256 --> 26:31.421
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!

26:32.295 --> 26:33.615
- Over here!
- Get him!

26:33.695 --> 26:35.943
Have you had enough? Tap out?

26:36.855 --> 26:40.259
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

26:41.975 --> 26:43.580
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

26:43.655 --> 26:44.855
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

26:44.935 --> 26:46.855
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

26:46.975 --> 26:48.175
Other way! Other way!

26:48.255 --> 26:49.662
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

26:49.814 --> 26:51.298
Run!

26:51.975 --> 26:53.295
Elway!

26:53.374 --> 26:55.622
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

26:55.935 --> 26:58.063
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

26:58.335 --> 27:00.822
Grace! Run!

27:00.974 --> 27:05.022
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

27:05.094 --> 27:07.178
Grace, we're being attacked!

27:07.494 --> 27:09.741
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

27:10.055 --> 27:12.096
It's okay, it's okay.

27:15.015 --> 27:16.138
They're friendly.

27:16.654 --> 27:18.455
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

27:18.533 --> 27:21.501
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.697
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

27:32.853 --> 27:36.737
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

27:36.812 --> 27:39.136
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

27:40.093 --> 27:43.454
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...

27:44.532 --> 27:47.172
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

27:47.253 --> 27:49.893
Yes, yes, yes!

27:50.093 --> 27:51.740
With this precious elixir,

27:51.812 --> 27:58.380
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

28:01.812 --> 28:06.853
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

28:16.892 --> 28:18.179
This is great!

28:18.372 --> 28:21.973
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

28:22.252 --> 28:26.136
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin

28:26.212 --> 28:30.379
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin

28:30.452 --> 28:32.940
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.419
Oh, really? After you.

28:34.492 --> 28:35.855
How crazy is this?

28:35.932 --> 28:39.020
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

28:42.131 --> 28:45.219
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

28:45.291 --> 28:46.851
Sorry.

28:47.451 --> 28:51.651
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.739
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.572
Documented by Peyo.

28:55.852 --> 28:59.812
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

28:59.892 --> 29:02.215
It says they're mythical, Grace.

29:02.851 --> 29:04.215
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

29:04.292 --> 29:05.732
Well, they look pretty real to me.

29:05.851 --> 29:07.171
Come on.

29:11.329 --> 29:13.097
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

29:13.170 --> 29:17.491
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

29:17.611 --> 29:19.575
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

29:19.651 --> 29:21.014
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

29:21.090 --> 29:22.650
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

29:22.729 --> 29:25.491
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

29:25.570 --> 29:27.654
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

29:29.889 --> 29:32.529
And you're all
named after your personalities?

29:32.691 --> 29:36.018
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

29:36.090 --> 29:37.214
- Yeah.
- Yep.

29:37.290 --> 29:38.490
Yeah, whatever.

29:38.569 --> 29:41.613
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

29:41.689 --> 29:43.250
on your magic window machine.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.013
Just what is this magic searching device?

29:46.290 --> 29:47.774
Right now, I'm using Google.

29:49.690 --> 29:51.577
- Google.
- Google.

29:53.929 --> 29:58.698
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

29:58.771 --> 30:00.375
"A figurative construct..."

30:00.770 --> 30:02.297
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

30:02.369 --> 30:05.053
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

30:05.209 --> 30:06.411
- What?
- Not blue?

30:06.489 --> 30:08.136
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

30:08.209 --> 30:12.093
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

30:12.169 --> 30:13.936
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

30:14.009 --> 30:15.330
to invoke the blue moon.

30:15.409 --> 30:16.697
You hear that, honey?

30:16.769 --> 30:19.093
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

30:19.369 --> 30:22.577
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

30:22.649 --> 30:25.255
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

30:25.328 --> 30:26.933
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

30:27.010 --> 30:30.578
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

30:30.649 --> 30:34.937
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

30:35.449 --> 30:37.729
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

30:37.809 --> 30:38.856
My what-whatzer?

30:39.728 --> 30:41.649
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?

30:41.729 --> 30:44.456
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

30:44.529 --> 30:47.169
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

30:47.249 --> 30:48.656
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

30:49.048 --> 30:52.649
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurf y.

30:52.888 --> 30:54.089
Right, Papa?

30:56.448 --> 31:00.169
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

31:04.247 --> 31:08.251
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

31:08.326 --> 31:10.246
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

31:10.527 --> 31:13.615
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

31:13.687 --> 31:16.131
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.215
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

31:18.287 --> 31:20.687
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

31:20.767 --> 31:23.090
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.295
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

31:25.367 --> 31:29.612
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

31:29.687 --> 31:32.174
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

31:33.447 --> 31:36.010
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

31:38.847 --> 31:40.812
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

31:41.127 --> 31:42.971
Pardon me, wise sir?

31:43.046 --> 31:45.207
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

31:46.766 --> 31:48.371
They're everywhere!

31:48.687 --> 31:51.413
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

31:51.926 --> 31:53.007
I know.

31:53.327 --> 31:57.855
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.

31:57.927 --> 32:00.175
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

32:00.247 --> 32:02.646
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.

32:02.765 --> 32:05.853
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

32:05.926 --> 32:09.211
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

32:09.287 --> 32:10.846
Bye, Elway.

32:10.926 --> 32:13.130
Someone looks smurfalish!

32:13.206 --> 32:15.289
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

32:15.365 --> 32:17.526
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

32:17.725 --> 32:21.173
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

32:21.247 --> 32:23.374
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.486
What are you, you pasty giant?

32:25.566 --> 32:29.570
I try to get people to buy things
by analyzing market trend predictions.

32:29.645 --> 32:33.246
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.770
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

32:35.846 --> 32:37.854
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.570
You had one outfit on,

32:39.646 --> 32:42.526
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

32:42.605 --> 32:43.850
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

32:43.925 --> 32:45.965
she probably got the other one dirty.

32:46.045 --> 32:47.813
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.165
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.

32:50.244 --> 32:54.008
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

32:54.084 --> 32:58.612
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,
somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

32:58.925 --> 33:01.411
But, then you'd be further apart.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.565
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.248
I've got a baby on the way, so...

33:06.324 --> 33:09.532
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

33:10.563 --> 33:12.724
I'm 546 years old.

33:12.804 --> 33:14.287
Of course you are.

33:14.363 --> 33:15.847
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

33:15.924 --> 33:18.007
- Love you.
- Okay.

33:18.604 --> 33:19.892
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

33:19.964 --> 33:22.211
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

33:22.484 --> 33:23.564
Why not?

33:24.523 --> 33:27.928
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

33:28.004 --> 33:29.651
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

33:30.605 --> 33:33.004
It's a movie. A moving picture.

33:33.364 --> 33:35.405
Book. Just stay, okay?

33:36.283 --> 33:39.491
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a Stargazer.

33:39.564 --> 33:43.568
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

33:43.643 --> 33:46.808
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

33:47.084 --> 33:48.567
Excellent work, Brainy.

33:48.643 --> 33:50.531
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

33:50.604 --> 33:52.371
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

33:52.443 --> 33:55.084
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.

33:56.403 --> 33:58.444
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

33:58.524 --> 34:02.048
Clumsy, I think it might be best

34:02.124 --> 34:04.131
if you stay here. You know?

34:04.402 --> 34:06.607
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

34:10.683 --> 34:13.127
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

34:13.643 --> 34:15.650
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

34:15.723 --> 34:18.210
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

34:18.283 --> 34:19.929
Smurf away!

34:20.003 --> 34:22.087
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

34:22.163 --> 34:23.330
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

34:23.402 --> 34:25.726
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.242
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

34:27.322 --> 34:29.887
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

34:29.963 --> 34:31.806
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

34:31.922 --> 34:33.603
Goodbye, blue world.

34:33.683 --> 34:35.330
Use your hat, you ninny!

34:35.562 --> 34:38.366
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

34:39.400 --> 34:40.764
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

34:41.762 --> 34:43.726
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

34:44.762 --> 34:46.725
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

34:46.801 --> 34:48.089
Not to me, Grouchy.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.561
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

34:50.641 --> 34:52.649
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

34:52.922 --> 34:55.245
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

34:55.321 --> 34:56.400
- Hey.
- Right here.

34:56.482 --> 34:57.606
What are you doing here?

34:57.682 --> 35:01.326
What part of "we need a Stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

35:01.521 --> 35:04.926
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

35:05.081 --> 35:08.289
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

35:08.361 --> 35:10.368
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.482
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

35:12.841 --> 35:14.129
All of you. Trust me.

35:14.441 --> 35:15.849
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.244
I'm not going... Hey!

35:18.320 --> 35:20.361
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

35:20.441 --> 35:21.728
All right, who smurfed?

35:22.760 --> 35:24.485
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

35:24.561 --> 35:27.288
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.129
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

35:32.201 --> 35:34.120
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.209
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

35:36.280 --> 35:38.407
- You're late.
- Odile!

35:39.160 --> 35:40.240
You were in my office.

35:40.561 --> 35:43.200
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.323
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

35:46.400 --> 35:49.128
Close. I had a crazy morning.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.244
What are you doing?

35:51.361 --> 35:55.441
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

35:55.521 --> 36:00.124
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.679
Nervous energy.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.724
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.967
- I like it.
- Yep.

36:05.161 --> 36:08.805
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.044
Hey! Stop it.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.759
- Henri.
- Make it work.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.687
You have no idea.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.007
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

36:18.079 --> 36:21.484
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

36:21.559 --> 36:23.360
Are you crazy?

36:23.441 --> 36:25.240
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

36:25.320 --> 36:28.440
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.806
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?

36:29.878 --> 36:33.642
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.

36:33.719 --> 36:37.287
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?

36:37.358 --> 36:41.722
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

36:41.798 --> 36:45.606
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

36:46.157 --> 36:49.038
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

36:49.118 --> 36:52.283
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

36:52.358 --> 36:55.566
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

36:56.237 --> 36:58.082
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

36:59.038 --> 37:00.085
Stop.

37:00.158 --> 37:01.445
La la la la la la

37:01.558 --> 37:02.606
Stop!

37:02.678 --> 37:04.522
Sing a happy song

37:04.598 --> 37:07.566
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

37:07.638 --> 37:09.045
I find it annoying.

37:09.638 --> 37:11.842
Well, what do you sing at work?

37:11.917 --> 37:14.122
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

37:14.197 --> 37:16.117
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

37:16.198 --> 37:18.359
I know. How about if we hum?

37:20.997 --> 37:22.045
Please stop humming.

37:28.476 --> 37:29.917
I need to hone my message here.

37:30.079 --> 37:31.202
I've got a message.

37:31.278 --> 37:34.966
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

37:35.037 --> 37:36.837
That's good. You should use that.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.805
Or, "Dance and be happy."

37:38.877 --> 37:40.763
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

37:40.836 --> 37:43.805
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

37:43.877 --> 37:47.118
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

37:47.957 --> 37:50.477
It's an embarrassment of riches.

37:50.557 --> 37:51.877
They're giving you gold here.

37:52.076 --> 37:53.844
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

37:53.917 --> 37:57.278
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

37:57.357 --> 37:58.601
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.878
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

37:59.957 --> 38:02.086
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

38:06.677 --> 38:09.525
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

38:11.316 --> 38:17.001
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

38:18.156 --> 38:21.244
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

38:21.435 --> 38:22.515
What?

38:22.715 --> 38:23.882
Where? Where?

38:25.395 --> 38:27.119
What?

38:29.396 --> 38:32.636
Curses! So close.

38:33.075 --> 38:34.679
What?

38:37.075 --> 38:39.562
Theirs is upside-down.

38:39.755 --> 38:42.875
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.

38:43.916 --> 38:44.963
- Hi.
- Hello.

38:45.035 --> 38:46.039
What are you doing?

38:46.115 --> 38:48.363
Just greening things up a bit.

38:48.435 --> 38:52.003
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

38:52.075 --> 38:54.519
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuffs gonna grow out here.

38:54.595 --> 38:58.076
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

38:58.635 --> 39:00.119
So where is everybody else?

39:00.196 --> 39:01.756
They went to get a Stargazer

39:01.835 --> 39:04.039
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

39:04.115 --> 39:05.315
And they went without you?

39:05.395 --> 39:08.199
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

39:10.755 --> 39:12.196
- Hey!
- Sorry!

39:12.595 --> 39:13.838
Why don't we come inside?

39:13.914 --> 39:16.642
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

39:16.715 --> 39:18.678
this new anti-aging cream can make

39:19.115 --> 39:24.123
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.236
Astonishing, really.

39:29.554 --> 39:31.442
I see no transformation.

39:31.514 --> 39:33.794
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

39:33.874 --> 39:36.601
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.960
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

39:40.235 --> 39:42.515
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

39:42.593 --> 39:44.154
How sad for you in 30 years.

39:44.754 --> 39:47.242
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

39:47.314 --> 39:48.514
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

39:48.594 --> 39:51.115
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

39:51.195 --> 39:55.003
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

39:55.155 --> 39:57.598
Alakazootiful!

40:11.672 --> 40:12.993
How did you do that?

40:13.153 --> 40:15.194
Yes, and seriously, me next.

40:15.392 --> 40:19.680
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

40:21.272 --> 40:24.316
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

40:24.432 --> 40:25.993
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

40:26.872 --> 40:28.672
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

40:28.791 --> 40:31.835
Please, señor Can you do that again?

40:33.153 --> 40:35.521
You may attempt to persuade me.

40:37.192 --> 40:39.079
What is it that you desire?

40:39.832 --> 40:41.392
Riches?

40:42.633 --> 40:43.636
Fame?

40:44.911 --> 40:45.916
Fortune?

40:47.192 --> 40:48.512
With my help,

40:49.112 --> 40:54.960
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

40:56.911 --> 40:57.916
Gargamel.

40:58.551 --> 41:05.076
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

41:07.552 --> 41:08.631
L.m

41:10.351 --> 41:14.955
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

41:16.072 --> 41:19.356
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

41:19.471 --> 41:22.472
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

41:22.672 --> 41:24.079
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

41:24.191 --> 41:27.476
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

41:28.070 --> 41:29.479
Well, I used to be.

41:29.752 --> 41:30.952
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:31.391 --> 41:34.032
So how long did it take you to...

41:35.870 --> 41:37.115
Gosh.

41:37.192 --> 41:39.275
Un-fumble your feet?

41:40.311 --> 41:44.872
Well, about as long as it takes to realize
that nobody's just one thing.

41:45.992 --> 41:47.475
You can be anything you wanna be.

41:49.431 --> 41:51.798
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.358
Probably not.

41:56.271 --> 41:58.518
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

41:58.630 --> 42:00.158
First, you put your...

42:01.230 --> 42:02.430
Works every time.

42:02.510 --> 42:04.878
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

42:04.950 --> 42:08.277
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

42:14.310 --> 42:16.110
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

42:16.190 --> 42:18.829
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

42:18.949 --> 42:22.396
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

42:25.469 --> 42:27.116
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

42:27.350 --> 42:33.197
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

42:33.389 --> 42:34.829
Not if we Kill them first.

42:35.269 --> 42:39.350
Let's see, we're going to need some knights,
preferably in shining armor,

42:39.830 --> 42:42.349
some bowmen, poison arrows.

42:42.990 --> 42:44.310
I like the way you think.

42:44.390 --> 42:46.113
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

42:46.348 --> 42:47.712
Well, it is all about the presentation.

42:47.909 --> 42:51.597
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

42:51.828 --> 42:54.468
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?

42:54.709 --> 42:55.833
Get out of here.

42:59.389 --> 43:01.396
You have a wicked sense of humor.

43:01.468 --> 43:03.389
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

43:03.469 --> 43:04.636
Henri?

43:05.228 --> 43:06.395
I said, get out of here.

43:06.549 --> 43:10.629
Señor Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

43:10.869 --> 43:14.470
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

43:14.789 --> 43:16.632
but on a massive scale.

43:17.108 --> 43:20.468
Do that, and the world will worship you.

43:20.907 --> 43:22.948
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.

43:23.309 --> 43:30.118
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

43:31.748 --> 43:33.111
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

43:34.468 --> 43:37.152
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

43:37.508 --> 43:41.391
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

43:51.547 --> 43:54.832
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

43:56.186 --> 43:58.467
Now, to the matter at hand.

43:59.267 --> 44:00.871
So do we have a deal, señor?

44:02.427 --> 44:04.630
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

44:04.707 --> 44:10.195
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

44:13.147 --> 44:16.551
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

44:16.625 --> 44:18.634
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...

44:18.707 --> 44:22.154
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.830
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

44:23.986 --> 44:26.114
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

44:26.186 --> 44:27.353
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

44:27.425 --> 44:28.472
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

44:28.705 --> 44:30.506
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

44:30.826 --> 44:31.873
Hit the deck!

44:32.225 --> 44:34.865
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

44:34.947 --> 44:36.626
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

44:36.707 --> 44:38.234
Can't everyone just slow down

44:38.306 --> 44:39.353
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

44:39.426 --> 44:40.430
Wait for it.

44:40.786 --> 44:42.106
I gotta get me one of those.

44:42.385 --> 44:43.432
Oh, my gosh!

44:43.505 --> 44:45.153
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

44:45.226 --> 44:48.947
When we get inside, spread out
and find that Stargazer.

44:49.027 --> 44:50.150
Come on, Smurfs!

45:11.545 --> 45:13.586
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

45:13.705 --> 45:14.785
Grace, are you running?

45:14.865 --> 45:16.306
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

45:16.386 --> 45:18.153
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

45:18.225 --> 45:20.267
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

45:20.346 --> 45:22.386
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

45:22.505 --> 45:23.629
Patrick, they need you.

45:23.866 --> 45:25.273
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

45:25.704 --> 45:26.708
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

45:26.984 --> 45:28.186
All right. Where are you?

45:28.785 --> 45:33.465
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.

45:33.545 --> 45:34.592
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.426
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

45:37.584 --> 45:38.663
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

45:38.743 --> 45:40.032
You call that groveling, you fool?

45:41.223 --> 45:43.384
Every village has an idiot. What?

45:44.465 --> 45:48.229
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

45:48.424 --> 45:49.864
Smurf thief!

45:50.183 --> 45:51.472
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

45:51.544 --> 45:55.145
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...

45:56.943 --> 45:59.824
So that's where all the unicorns went.

45:59.944 --> 46:02.671
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

46:02.743 --> 46:04.151
Fine. Then hang on.

46:06.663 --> 46:10.111
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

46:11.504 --> 46:12.551
Perfect.

46:14.423 --> 46:17.991
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

46:18.943 --> 46:20.471
That'll put some air up your skirt!

46:23.543 --> 46:25.310
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.

46:25.503 --> 46:26.671
Predator!

46:29.583 --> 46:30.948
Smurf droppings.

46:33.062 --> 46:36.150
These are disgustingly tasty.

46:38.263 --> 46:39.463
Hello.

46:41.223 --> 46:42.228
Oh, creepy.

46:42.304 --> 46:45.184
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

46:45.262 --> 46:46.823
Stargazers, stargazers...

46:46.943 --> 46:48.110
Dresses!

46:48.182 --> 46:51.467
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

46:51.543 --> 46:52.547
What?

46:52.622 --> 46:54.587
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

46:54.663 --> 46:56.671
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

46:56.743 --> 46:59.111
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

47:05.982 --> 47:08.742
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

47:08.823 --> 47:10.351
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

47:12.103 --> 47:13.871
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

47:14.023 --> 47:15.790
Hold still, stairs!

47:16.222 --> 47:17.663
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

47:17.742 --> 47:18.865
- Hey.
- What is that?

47:18.981 --> 47:20.028
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

47:20.101 --> 47:21.989
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

47:22.542 --> 47:24.462
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.707
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

47:28.541 --> 47:30.189
I can't seem to get it to scan.

47:30.261 --> 47:32.421
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

47:33.181 --> 47:34.589
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

47:34.660 --> 47:36.068
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

47:36.141 --> 47:37.385
What aisle did you find this on?

47:37.462 --> 47:38.509
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

47:38.582 --> 47:41.430
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

47:41.541 --> 47:42.708
What? Ice Bat?

47:43.061 --> 47:44.304
It comes in pink.

47:48.420 --> 47:50.145
Smurf thief! Stop!

47:57.781 --> 48:01.305
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

48:01.461 --> 48:02.704
You bet.

48:02.820 --> 48:04.380
Smurf!

48:04.461 --> 48:05.749
But I've got feelings.

48:05.821 --> 48:09.061
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

48:09.180 --> 48:12.628
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

48:19.660 --> 48:21.744
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

48:21.820 --> 48:25.061
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

48:25.660 --> 48:28.584
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

48:28.660 --> 48:30.143
I'm not a toy!

48:30.219 --> 48:31.343
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

48:31.419 --> 48:32.424
- There she is!
- There she is!

48:32.500 --> 48:33.820
Hey, this dress is mine!

48:34.140 --> 48:36.421
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

48:36.540 --> 48:38.863
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

48:40.021 --> 48:41.668
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

48:41.940 --> 48:44.821
A giant's after me! She's huge!

48:45.340 --> 48:46.823
Hey, that's mine!

48:46.940 --> 48:48.981
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

48:49.180 --> 48:50.904
- Mommy!
- Really?

48:51.379 --> 48:56.781
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

48:56.860 --> 48:58.867
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

49:00.820 --> 49:04.988
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.347
Hey!

49:06.659 --> 49:08.100
That's one!

49:08.739 --> 49:11.467
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

49:11.540 --> 49:13.667
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

49:13.739 --> 49:16.707
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.

49:17.418 --> 49:19.460
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

49:19.538 --> 49:22.538
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

49:22.618 --> 49:25.858
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

49:25.938 --> 49:27.139
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

49:27.218 --> 49:28.461
Let's go, go, go!

49:28.539 --> 49:30.579
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

49:30.657 --> 49:32.742
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

49:33.578 --> 49:34.986
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

49:35.058 --> 49:37.938
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

49:38.018 --> 49:40.386
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

49:42.939 --> 49:44.618
Two more!

49:45.098 --> 49:47.542
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

49:49.697 --> 49:50.985
Grace, that's Gargamel!

49:54.618 --> 49:57.465
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

49:58.459 --> 49:59.779
Bad kitty!

50:00.218 --> 50:01.461
Oh, I hate that Cat!

50:08.057 --> 50:09.345
Gargamel.

50:09.537 --> 50:10.978
Smurfette.

50:11.058 --> 50:13.338
More lovely than ever.

50:13.537 --> 50:16.745
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

50:17.817 --> 50:19.224
Or not!

50:20.896 --> 50:24.737
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

50:25.618 --> 50:27.101
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

50:27.937 --> 50:31.626
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

50:36.456 --> 50:37.460
Yahoo!

50:39.896 --> 50:41.020
- Patrick.
- Hey.

50:42.737 --> 50:44.100
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

50:44.176 --> 50:45.737
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

50:52.775 --> 50:56.583
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

50:56.656 --> 50:58.337
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

50:58.536 --> 51:01.657
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

51:01.777 --> 51:05.704
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

51:11.855 --> 51:13.939
Let me... Let me see here...

51:35.535 --> 51:37.903
How can you be the only girl in the village?

51:37.975 --> 51:41.456
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

51:42.574 --> 51:46.055
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

51:46.294 --> 51:49.021
Wow. And then what happened?

51:49.294 --> 51:50.537
Papa saved me.

51:50.615 --> 51:55.339
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

51:56.014 --> 51:57.574
No. Play it safe.

52:01.854 --> 52:08.139
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

52:10.413 --> 52:13.654
Well, here goes nothing.

52:15.614 --> 52:18.701
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

52:18.774 --> 52:20.738
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

52:20.854 --> 52:24.498
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

52:24.574 --> 52:27.335
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

52:30.133 --> 52:31.542
Well, it's off.

52:31.614 --> 52:34.821
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

52:36.774 --> 52:37.853
Hey, what's wrong?

52:38.133 --> 52:39.661
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. It's okay.

52:39.734 --> 52:42.178
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

52:42.293 --> 52:44.138
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.

52:44.893 --> 52:46.738
I know the feeling.

52:48.214 --> 52:49.894
Better yet...

52:50.133 --> 52:51.781
I know the cure.

52:54.573 --> 52:56.853
You just match the colors with the buttons.

53:05.252 --> 53:06.496
You try.

53:06.573 --> 53:08.820
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

53:09.131 --> 53:10.736
- You're good!
- Nice one!

53:11.412 --> 53:14.456
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

53:14.533 --> 53:15.657
Walk this way...

53:15.732 --> 53:16.812
You sing.

53:16.892 --> 53:19.816
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

53:21.771 --> 53:23.180
It's a rock face.

53:23.852 --> 53:25.499
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

53:25.571 --> 53:26.575
Never mind.

53:26.651 --> 53:27.939
- Like this
- Like this

53:31.572 --> 53:33.733
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy

53:33.812 --> 53:35.579
Little skirts climbing way up her knee

53:35.652 --> 53:37.736
Not another single girl
in the whole smurf in' world

53:37.812 --> 53:39.819
And I can't believe
she's lookin' at me

53:39.891 --> 53:40.938
- it's a complete
- Surrender

53:41.011 --> 53:42.179
- To the power of her
- Gender

53:42.253 --> 53:44.052
So I close my eyes and make a wish

53:44.132 --> 53:45.179
- I just want to
- Savor

53:45.251 --> 53:46.299
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor

53:46.372 --> 53:48.575
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this

53:53.851 --> 53:56.251
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

53:56.331 --> 53:58.132
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

53:58.211 --> 54:00.459
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!

54:01.131 --> 54:02.419
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

54:02.491 --> 54:05.252
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

54:05.331 --> 54:06.738
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

54:08.250 --> 54:10.574
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

54:10.652 --> 54:12.092
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

54:12.171 --> 54:13.776
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

54:13.971 --> 54:15.454
That was rare.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.339
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

54:38.450 --> 54:40.491
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

54:40.571 --> 54:43.778
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

54:45.570 --> 54:47.054
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

54:47.249 --> 54:48.658
Sorry, boys.

54:49.969 --> 54:52.173
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

54:52.249 --> 54:55.652
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

55:01.769 --> 55:03.176
- It's approved.
- What?

55:03.248 --> 55:05.169
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

55:05.248 --> 55:08.937
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

55:09.169 --> 55:10.490
Oh, my goodness!

55:10.569 --> 55:11.978
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

55:12.169 --> 55:14.372
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

55:15.168 --> 55:16.457
Yeah.

55:17.048 --> 55:19.132
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

55:19.368 --> 55:21.769
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

55:21.849 --> 55:22.972
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

55:23.049 --> 55:24.697
Do it, do it.

55:24.769 --> 55:25.848
Go, go, go!

55:25.929 --> 55:28.449
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

55:28.568 --> 55:29.976
It's a go, laddie boy!

55:30.488 --> 55:33.369
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

55:33.448 --> 55:35.052
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

55:35.329 --> 55:36.769
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

55:36.849 --> 55:40.057
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

55:40.289 --> 55:42.012
But we are going home, right?

55:42.088 --> 55:45.012
Of course. Just not tonight.

55:46.168 --> 55:47.576
Now, off to bed.

55:51.729 --> 55:55.090
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

55:55.289 --> 55:57.013
I miss the other Smurfs.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.052
Me, too.

55:59.129 --> 56:01.528
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

56:01.767 --> 56:05.935
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

56:07.769 --> 56:09.852
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

56:11.128 --> 56:13.692
Everything's going to be just fine.

56:14.047 --> 56:15.249
Papa?

56:15.327 --> 56:19.615
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

56:20.128 --> 56:21.491
Don't worry.

56:21.568 --> 56:24.329
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

56:28.727 --> 56:31.771
If only the stars would align.

56:40.166 --> 56:43.647
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

56:43.766 --> 56:46.734
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.

56:47.127 --> 56:49.691
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

56:49.766 --> 56:54.054
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

56:54.166 --> 56:57.166
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

56:57.245 --> 56:58.370
- Aye.
- Yeah.

56:58.486 --> 57:01.846
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

57:02.846 --> 57:06.054
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

57:06.686 --> 57:09.206
Oh, hello, little moth.

57:09.285 --> 57:14.894
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

57:15.606 --> 57:19.010
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

57:19.525 --> 57:21.490
Both of us meant to soar.

57:21.565 --> 57:26.366
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

57:26.885 --> 57:30.333
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

57:30.485 --> 57:32.569
Fly! Fly!

57:32.886 --> 57:34.206
Fly!

57:38.645 --> 57:41.689
Okay. Let's see here.

57:41.766 --> 57:42.845
Hey.

57:43.445 --> 57:45.126
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

57:46.325 --> 57:49.446
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

57:51.484 --> 57:56.973
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

57:57.046 --> 57:59.685
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

57:59.805 --> 58:03.689
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

58:04.405 --> 58:05.529
Thank you.

58:06.684 --> 58:10.208
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

58:10.405 --> 58:12.893
But here, without my books and potions...

58:12.966 --> 58:17.526
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

58:17.844 --> 58:18.968
Well, what are you gonna do?

58:19.164 --> 58:23.124
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

58:23.844 --> 58:27.008
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

58:27.483 --> 58:29.852
And you never give up on family.

58:33.363 --> 58:36.244
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

58:36.963 --> 58:40.007
having all those little guys
depending on you?

58:41.364 --> 58:43.612
I mean, what if you screw up?

58:44.563 --> 58:46.407
How'd you know when you were ready?

58:46.803 --> 58:48.964
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

58:51.122 --> 58:53.163
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

58:53.243 --> 58:55.808
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

58:55.923 --> 58:57.286
Let me ask you something.

58:57.883 --> 59:00.883
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

59:01.363 --> 59:04.244
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

59:06.323 --> 59:08.527
Well, that's what being a papa is.

59:08.603 --> 59:10.971
When it comes time, you just do.

59:12.403 --> 59:15.523
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

59:18.883 --> 59:22.363
It comes from here, where it matters most.

59:23.523 --> 59:25.050
My spleen?

59:25.123 --> 59:27.327
No, your heart.

59:27.443 --> 59:31.611
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

59:35.483 --> 59:39.127
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

59:56.602 --> 59:58.446
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

59:58.522 --> 01:00:00.725
Come on, baby, stop playing.

01:00:02.041 --> 01:00:05.041
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.085
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

01:00:08.722 --> 01:00:10.010
Be gone with you, behemoth,

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:14.689
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:16.448
to free me from this confine.

01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.642
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:21.485
You see? You see?

01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:24.888
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.169
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.804
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.404
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

01:00:37.361 --> 01:00:39.444
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:42.884
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.088
So long, scallywags!

01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:51.085
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.368
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:55.760
Wait, take me with you!

01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:57.848
Wait! Wait!

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.087
To my castle for more essence!

01:01:14.719 --> 01:01:16.159
Here they come, here they come.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.164
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.121
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

01:01:25.199 --> 01:01:26.999
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:30.007
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:33.440
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

01:01:33.519 --> 01:01:34.882
I think there's too much pink.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:38.244
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

01:01:38.318 --> 01:01:39.606
Yeah, it does.

01:01:39.678 --> 01:01:40.999
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

01:01:41.079 --> 01:01:44.363
- High five. High four.
- High four.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.764
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:53.479
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

01:01:53.558 --> 01:01:55.238
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:56.846
I never doubted it for a second.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.803
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:02.758
That's our only chance.

01:02:02.838 --> 01:02:05.719
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:07.726
to open the portal home.

01:02:07.797 --> 01:02:10.840
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:13.118
Is there a place that sells spells?

01:02:13.198 --> 01:02:14.398
No.

01:02:14.517 --> 01:02:17.845
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:20.084
How about old books?

01:02:20.397 --> 01:02:22.764
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:24.637
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.

01:02:24.718 --> 01:02:28.242
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

01:02:28.318 --> 01:02:30.161
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

01:02:30.237 --> 01:02:32.158
Hey! Smurf hug!

01:02:33.677 --> 01:02:35.445
Oh, I love you guys!

01:02:35.597 --> 01:02:37.005
Bring it in, big fella.

01:02:37.077 --> 01:02:38.604
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

01:02:38.678 --> 01:02:39.801
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.238
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.766
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

01:02:42.838 --> 01:02:44.878
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.

01:02:51.276 --> 01:02:52.956
Hey, get up here.

01:02:58.036 --> 01:03:00.524
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

01:03:00.596 --> 01:03:02.680
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:05.723
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

01:03:05.836 --> 01:03:07.440
We've already got one.

01:03:07.677 --> 01:03:08.997
- Really?
- What?

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.957
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

01:03:12.077 --> 01:03:14.565
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

01:03:16.916 --> 01:03:19.120
That's the wrong ad.

01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:30.360
What happened to my office?

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:33.557
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:37.199
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:40.956
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

01:03:41.035 --> 01:03:42.596
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

01:03:42.676 --> 01:03:45.360
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

01:03:48.596 --> 01:03:53.277
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.

01:03:53.357 --> 01:03:55.756
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta,
just got me fired.

01:03:56.076 --> 01:03:57.756
You sent the wrong file.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:00.279
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

01:04:00.394 --> 01:04:02.794
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.243
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

01:04:05.355 --> 01:04:09.119
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

01:04:12.755 --> 01:04:14.478
Blue. Little blue...

01:04:14.674 --> 01:04:15.797
Okay...

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:17.995
Patrick.

01:04:20.114 --> 01:04:21.238
What are you doing?

01:04:21.354 --> 01:04:23.001
Going to try to save my job.

01:04:23.114 --> 01:04:25.842
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

01:04:25.914 --> 01:04:27.713
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

01:04:27.793 --> 01:04:31.677
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

01:04:32.074 --> 01:04:33.362
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

01:04:33.434 --> 01:04:36.719
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:37.834
See?

01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:39.674
Okay, Patrick, wait.

01:04:40.954 --> 01:04:42.634
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

01:04:42.714 --> 01:04:44.394
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:45.761
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:48.639
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:50.678
And I hope that you can straighten that out.

01:04:50.794 --> 01:04:53.075
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:57.194
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.517
Of all the people on the planet,

01:04:58.634 --> 01:05:00.915
those magical little creatures came to us.

01:05:01.034 --> 01:05:02.638
They chose us.

01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:06.717
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

01:05:06.993 --> 01:05:09.154
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:11.152
This is our blue moon.

01:05:12.634 --> 01:05:15.754
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:17.357
you're gonna miss it.

01:05:25.353 --> 01:05:26.957
Hey, hey. Taxi!

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.714
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:33.997
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

01:05:34.632 --> 01:05:35.921
NOT DOW.

01:05:36.153 --> 01:05:37.560
What? What?

01:05:42.513 --> 01:05:46.037
Very, very well done, my little friend.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:50.000
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

01:05:51.432 --> 01:05:55.840
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

01:05:56.072 --> 01:05:59.280
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

01:05:59.512 --> 01:06:03.156
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:04.995
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

01:06:05.071 --> 01:06:08.552
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.

01:06:40.231 --> 01:06:41.715
Smurf me.

01:07:28.149 --> 01:07:29.754
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:30.877
According to the searching device,

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:33.078
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.350
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.597
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:37.713
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:39.509
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:40.790
- What?
- Jump!

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.636
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

01:07:44.469 --> 01:07:46.836
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

01:07:46.948 --> 01:07:49.076
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:53.836
That was great.

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:57.436
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.475
For smurf's sake.

01:08:00.548 --> 01:08:02.676
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:03.989
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:05.912
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

01:08:05.988 --> 01:08:07.592
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

01:08:07.828 --> 01:08:09.029
- It's closed.
- Figures.

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:11.472
We have to find a way in. Come on.

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:19.508
I'm gettin' too old for this.

01:08:20.548 --> 01:08:21.749
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:22.995
All right, everybody.

01:08:23.108 --> 01:08:24.156
- Hey.
- Wow.

01:08:24.228 --> 01:08:25.274
This place looks creepy to me.

01:08:25.348 --> 01:08:27.115
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:29.392
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

01:08:29.508 --> 01:08:32.792
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:39.670
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire,
limitless power and world adulation.

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:42.795
Now why does it have to be so hard?

01:08:48.308 --> 01:08:51.756
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

01:08:51.908 --> 01:08:54.308
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:55.546
It's your little blue men.

01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:57.830
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:02.515
You know, that song is really annoying.

01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:05.674
Cautiously excited.

01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:09.991
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

01:09:10.066 --> 01:09:12.631
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:15.116
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

01:09:15.267 --> 01:09:18.506
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:22.154
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:24.071
Oh. Nearly there.

01:09:25.185 --> 01:09:29.670
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

01:09:29.826 --> 01:09:31.027
Ah, yes.

01:09:31.107 --> 01:09:33.354
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”

01:09:34.225 --> 01:09:35.589
Peyo.

01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:40.069
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:43.750
- Look at that.
- Wow.

01:09:43.904 --> 01:09:45.509
Well, I'll be smurf ed.

01:09:45.986 --> 01:09:48.473
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

01:09:48.546 --> 01:09:50.073
You see all that in there?

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.750
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

01:09:58.386 --> 01:10:00.305
Openous-lockicuss.

01:10:07.105 --> 01:10:08.425
What?

01:10:13.866 --> 01:10:18.350
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

01:10:25.826 --> 01:10:28.706
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:33.989
All that remains now is to return
to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:36.584
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

01:10:36.703 --> 01:10:38.712
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

01:10:38.825 --> 01:10:42.633
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

01:10:42.945 --> 01:10:46.546
where your essence shall finally be mine.

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:48.869
- The dragon wand.
- No!

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:50.024
It's...

01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:51.823
Oh, please, please, allow me.

01:10:53.265 --> 01:10:55.513
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:57.385
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

01:10:57.505 --> 01:10:58.552
Wait for me!

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:00.633
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

01:11:00.704 --> 01:11:02.591
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

01:11:02.664 --> 01:11:03.787
After all,

01:11:03.903 --> 01:11:06.631
what is the hunt without the thrill!

01:11:10.664 --> 01:11:11.788
No!

01:11:20.224 --> 01:11:21.511
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.143
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

01:11:23.263 --> 01:11:24.268
Let's get outta here.

01:11:24.384 --> 01:11:27.952
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

01:11:28.343 --> 01:11:29.467
It has to be tonight.

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.026
Me? Smurf the moon?

01:11:31.102 --> 01:11:33.187
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.791
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:38.391
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:39.707
- Papa, no!
- No!

01:11:39.783 --> 01:11:41.986
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

01:11:42.103 --> 01:11:44.384
Come to papa, Papa!

01:11:45.542 --> 01:11:47.746
- Just go!
- Papa!

01:11:47.864 --> 01:11:49.151
- Papa!
- No!

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:50.631
Keep movin', lass.

01:11:50.782 --> 01:11:53.390
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.986
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:10.266
What's gonna happen to Papa?

01:12:10.342 --> 01:12:14.183
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:16.186
Come on. We don't have much time.

01:12:16.383 --> 01:12:17.626
"Come on"? Come on, where?

01:12:17.702 --> 01:12:19.906
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:24.382
We ride. Come on!

01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:27.902
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:29.985
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

01:12:30.743 --> 01:12:33.066
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.787
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

01:12:34.903 --> 01:12:36.822
But I'm not sure I can do this.

01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:40.262
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:44.026
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

01:12:46.302 --> 01:12:47.862
It's getting dark.

01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:50.745
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:52.065
Yeah.

01:12:55.461 --> 01:12:56.869
Hi.

01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:04.709
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:07.906
Listen, Grace, I'm...

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.145
Hey, Odile.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.548
Patrick...

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.663
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

01:13:20.739 --> 01:13:24.067
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

01:13:25.339 --> 01:13:28.427
But they're the ads I should have sent.

01:13:29.219 --> 01:13:31.303
The ads I almost did send.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.980
But I didn't 'cause...

01:13:35.459 --> 01:13:36.823
I second-guessed myself.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:42.744
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

01:13:44.899 --> 01:13:47.223
But this is right.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.220
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

01:13:50.299 --> 01:13:52.427
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:59.148
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

01:13:59.938 --> 01:14:02.023
"Once in a blue moon."

01:14:02.979 --> 01:14:07.419
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

01:14:07.579 --> 01:14:14.147
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

01:14:15.419 --> 01:14:20.908
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

01:14:22.298 --> 01:14:23.858
you might just miss it.

01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:27.422
That's what that image means.

01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:32.380
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

01:14:35.457 --> 01:14:38.622
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

01:14:44.219 --> 01:14:46.302
I so smurf in' love you.

01:14:49.138 --> 01:14:51.658
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:54.139
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:57.303
We're outta control!

01:14:57.657 --> 01:14:59.906
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

01:15:00.817 --> 01:15:02.584
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

01:15:02.656 --> 01:15:04.424
Look! We got the incantation.

01:15:04.536 --> 01:15:06.500
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

01:15:06.617 --> 01:15:08.581
- What?
- Oh, no.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:12.098
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:14.943
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

01:15:15.297 --> 01:15:17.184
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

01:15:17.296 --> 01:15:20.144
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

01:15:20.217 --> 01:15:22.017
To extract his essence.

01:15:22.137 --> 01:15:23.981
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

01:15:24.057 --> 01:15:26.184
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

01:15:26.296 --> 01:15:29.177
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

01:15:29.337 --> 01:15:30.657
He's trying to protect us.

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.136
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

01:15:34.257 --> 01:15:35.545
No, no, no. We can't.

01:15:35.617 --> 01:15:38.465
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:40.344
- That's right.
- I didn't.

01:15:42.136 --> 01:15:43.903
I never promised him anything.

01:15:44.176 --> 01:15:47.897
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

01:15:49.856 --> 01:15:52.344
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

01:15:55.696 --> 01:15:57.016
I'm in.

01:16:00.535 --> 01:16:02.302
Aye. Me, too.

01:16:04.376 --> 01:16:08.337
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

01:16:09.175 --> 01:16:12.056
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

01:16:17.215 --> 01:16:20.020
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few

01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:22.463
And steal their essence blue

01:16:25.535 --> 01:16:29.179
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.580
Oh, look at this.

01:16:35.096 --> 01:16:41.860
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard
yields me all of this essence.

01:16:42.655 --> 01:16:48.263
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.415
Alakazookas!

01:16:53.294 --> 01:16:57.342
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

01:17:01.014 --> 01:17:04.702
No. No! The cages! No! No!

01:17:05.694 --> 01:17:09.175
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:11.381
I'll snip it from their hair.

01:17:12.534 --> 01:17:14.575
You're a fool, Gargamel.

01:17:14.654 --> 01:17:17.535
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

01:17:41.814 --> 01:17:44.335
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

01:17:50.293 --> 01:17:51.940
Good luck, Gutsy!

01:17:52.653 --> 01:17:56.058
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

01:18:06.132 --> 01:18:09.820
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

01:18:10.293 --> 01:18:11.460
Brainy, what's happening?

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:15.420
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

01:18:15.532 --> 01:18:16.897
I don't think I can do it.

01:18:17.013 --> 01:18:20.537
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.132
I'll be smurf ed!

01:18:39.372 --> 01:18:43.060
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

01:18:46.411 --> 01:18:48.812
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.735
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

01:18:52.331 --> 01:18:54.414
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

01:18:54.892 --> 01:18:57.379
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:07.536
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:10.972
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:14.418
- Yo!
- Huh?

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:17.018
Gargamel! Come out and play!

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.694
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:22.211
- No!
- Ah, well.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.691
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:28.178
And remember, keep your hands and feet

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:31.174
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:33.050
Smurfs, run!

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.375
Smurfs.

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:45.371
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurfed!

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:47.094
Yeah, what he said.

01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.650
Adorable.

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:52.211
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

01:19:52.529 --> 01:19:53.970
Hey, Gargamel.

01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:57.293
Make that three little smurfs.

01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:04.014
And I went home and got a few friends.

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.693
MY, my, my!

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.048
I think the whole village must be here.

01:20:29.489 --> 01:20:33.930
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

01:20:34.449 --> 01:20:35.769
On me, boys.

01:20:37.288 --> 01:20:38.292
Fire!

01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:40.656
Let's get this hoedown started!

01:20:41.208 --> 01:20:44.131
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.289
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

01:20:45.369 --> 01:20:48.609
For what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

01:20:48.689 --> 01:20:52.289
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:53.972
Hey! Seriously?

01:20:54.088 --> 01:20:56.369
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

01:20:59.248 --> 01:21:00.689
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

01:21:03.528 --> 01:21:05.012
Patrick, can you do it?

01:21:05.128 --> 01:21:06.132
Go, go, go!

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:07.731
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

01:21:09.848 --> 01:21:14.332
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

01:21:16.808 --> 01:21:18.488
Full smurf ahead!

01:21:18.768 --> 01:21:20.089
Come on!

01:21:22.247 --> 01:21:25.051
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.

01:21:28.527 --> 01:21:30.807
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

01:21:31.047 --> 01:21:32.008
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.854
I'm too beautiful to die!

01:21:43.728 --> 01:21:44.688
Oh, Papa.

01:21:44.927 --> 01:21:46.694
No. No, Smurfette.

01:21:46.766 --> 01:21:48.611
What did he do to you?

01:21:48.686 --> 01:21:49.766
You shouldn't have come back for me.

01:21:49.847 --> 01:21:51.767
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.

01:21:56.127 --> 01:21:57.131
Smurfette!

01:21:57.207 --> 01:21:59.094
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:03.731
Charge!

01:22:03.807 --> 01:22:04.810
Get him!

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:05.933
Grab the wand!

01:22:06.006 --> 01:22:07.174
- Goin' in!
- Go!

01:22:10.366 --> 01:22:11.371
Bombs away!

01:22:11.447 --> 01:22:13.814
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

01:22:15.286 --> 01:22:16.890
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

01:22:18.164 --> 01:22:19.485
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:23.810
Hang on, Papa.

01:22:27.286 --> 01:22:28.289
Onions!

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:31.769
Get back, cat.

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.326
Here, kitty, kitty...

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:43.249
Smurfette!

01:22:45.884 --> 01:22:47.085
Looking for me?

01:22:47.565 --> 01:22:49.048
Play time is over!

01:22:49.524 --> 01:22:53.048
Behold the awesome power of me!

01:23:21.565 --> 01:23:22.612
Smurfette?

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.247
Had enough, huh?

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:25.644
You're mine, kitty.

01:23:29.325 --> 01:23:31.244
I'm done smurfing around.

01:23:40.524 --> 01:23:42.652
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.

01:23:46.684 --> 01:23:48.124
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

01:23:51.924 --> 01:23:53.332
What's happening, Papa?

01:23:53.644 --> 01:23:54.603
No!

01:23:55.723 --> 01:23:58.288
Gargamel!

01:23:59.283 --> 01:24:01.967
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

01:24:02.444 --> 01:24:03.884
Oh, Papa!

01:24:05.324 --> 01:24:08.728
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.

01:24:09.163 --> 01:24:11.889
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

01:24:12.202 --> 01:24:14.809
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

01:24:14.923 --> 01:24:18.130
is about to meet his little blue end.

01:24:18.202 --> 01:24:19.206
No!

01:24:19.282 --> 01:24:20.690
Upsy-daisy!

01:24:20.843 --> 01:24:22.447
Oh, no. Papa!

01:24:22.522 --> 01:24:23.569
Papa!

01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:30.370
No! No!

01:24:30.442 --> 01:24:31.489
You again!

01:24:31.562 --> 01:24:32.687
Goodbye!

01:24:33.722 --> 01:24:34.769
I'm really...

01:24:35.242 --> 01:24:38.123
This ends here, this ends now!

01:24:38.201 --> 01:24:39.926
Really going to enjoy this.

01:24:40.202 --> 01:24:41.326
Gotcha!

01:24:41.801 --> 01:24:43.329
Freedom!

01:24:43.401 --> 01:24:44.886
Son of a smurf!

01:24:45.082 --> 01:24:46.370
Come back here!

01:24:46.442 --> 01:24:48.526
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

01:24:49.482 --> 01:24:52.122
Come back here right now with my wand!

01:24:53.481 --> 01:24:55.445
Oh, no. Crikey.

01:24:59.122 --> 01:25:01.163
I... I got it.

01:25:01.482 --> 01:25:03.491
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

01:25:03.562 --> 01:25:06.845
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:11.769
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

01:25:12.402 --> 01:25:14.126
I got it! I got it!

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:18.009
The vision's never been wrong.

01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:31.570
I got it!

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:36.045
My wand! Give me back my wand!

01:25:50.481 --> 01:25:51.724
How dare you!

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:57.489
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.326
Oh, my God.

01:26:03.399 --> 01:26:05.003
Smurfs!

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.008
Are you dead?

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.560
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

01:26:17.638 --> 01:26:19.166
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

01:26:19.879 --> 01:26:22.324
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!

01:26:22.999 --> 01:26:24.527
- Patrick.
- Hey.

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:28.206
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:33.079
Clumsy, you're a hero.

01:26:33.158 --> 01:26:34.326
I'm a hero?

01:26:34.478 --> 01:26:35.602
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:36.039 --> 01:26:40.687
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

01:26:41.359 --> 01:26:44.686
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

01:26:45.839 --> 01:26:48.042
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

01:26:48.398 --> 01:26:51.563
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.

01:26:52.839 --> 01:26:54.607
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.358
Thanks, Papa.

01:26:57.159 --> 01:26:59.558
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:02.046
And now to get rid of this!

01:27:07.318 --> 01:27:10.646
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

01:27:11.238 --> 01:27:13.322
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

01:27:15.558 --> 01:27:17.118
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:20.558
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

01:27:20.679 --> 01:27:21.726
- Bye.
- Take care.

01:27:21.798 --> 01:27:24.886
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:28.723
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

01:27:28.838 --> 01:27:33.802
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

01:27:34.358 --> 01:27:37.043
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

01:27:37.158 --> 01:27:38.925
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

01:27:39.557 --> 01:27:41.718
I've never had a girlfriend before.

01:27:43.797 --> 01:27:47.005
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

01:27:48.197 --> 01:27:49.157
High four.

01:27:51.117 --> 01:27:52.842
High four, Grace.

01:27:54.117 --> 01:27:55.917
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:58.000
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

01:27:58.596 --> 01:28:00.516
Hero? Stop.

01:28:01.157 --> 01:28:03.436
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

01:28:03.556 --> 01:28:05.040
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:13.476
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

01:28:14.117 --> 01:28:16.037
- You saved me.
- So long!

01:28:16.556 --> 01:28:18.116
You saved my whole family.

01:28:18.316 --> 01:28:21.317
Actually I think it was the other way around.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:25.637
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

01:28:25.956 --> 01:28:28.084
Your village has given me some ideas.

01:28:29.316 --> 01:28:30.604
Come here.

01:28:39.275 --> 01:28:40.759
Goodbye, Papa.

01:28:41.475 --> 01:28:43.723
Goodbye, Papa.

01:28:50.355 --> 01:28:51.884
Let's go home.

01:28:54.915 --> 01:28:58.843
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

01:28:59.396 --> 01:29:03.521
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

01:29:03.595 --> 01:29:05.723
a little smurfier.

01:29:05.795 --> 01:29:08.359
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

01:29:08.435 --> 01:29:10.519
Hey! Seriously, stop!

01:29:11.476 --> 01:29:13.320
Bye, New York!

01:29:22.754 --> 01:29:24.838
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

01:29:24.915 --> 01:29:27.239
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

01:29:28.395 --> 01:29:30.599
Finally someone has given me what I want.

01:29:38.113 --> 01:29:39.237
I think I'm not fired.

01:29:40.593 --> 01:29:41.640
Wow!

01:29:45.473 --> 01:29:48.921
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

01:29:50.434 --> 01:29:52.441
some unique new friends...

01:29:57.033 --> 01:29:59.117
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

01:29:59.474 --> 01:30:02.355
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

01:30:07.714 --> 01:30:08.718
Oh, Grace...

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.161
I smurf you.

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:09.518
Smurfs. Smurfs!

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:16.874
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:22.110
What are you looking at?
