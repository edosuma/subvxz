00:05.338 --> 00:06.572
            - UGH!              
        [gunshot]               

00:06.639 --> 00:09.041
      - WE'RE GONNA LOOK        
      AT PROBABLY THE TWO       

00:09.109 --> 00:10.743
    GREATEST WARRIORS           
  OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY.    

00:10.810 --> 00:14.313
      THEODORE ROOSEVELT        
  VERSUS LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.    

00:14.381 --> 00:15.781
    - I LOVE THIS MATCHUP.      

00:15.849 --> 00:17.049
     I THINK THESE ARE TWO      
         AMAZING MEN,           

00:17.117 --> 00:18.417
 AND WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED  
        IN THEIR LIVES          

00:18.485 --> 00:19.818
        IS INCREDIBLE.          

00:19.886 --> 00:22.287
  ROOSEVELT WAS A POLITICIAN,   
        A LEADER,               

00:22.355 --> 00:24.790
        A HARD CHARGER,         
        A COWBOY.               

00:24.858 --> 00:27.493
     VERY SMART, FOCUSED,       
    HAD A TON OF WILLPOWER.     

00:27.560 --> 00:30.529
        IN 1898,                
  HE CREATED THE ROUGH RIDERS   

00:30.597 --> 00:32.296
    TO TAKE SAN JUAN HILL,      

00:32.365 --> 00:33.899
            WINNING             
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.       

00:33.967 --> 00:36.201
    AGAINST T.E. LAWRENCE.      

00:36.269 --> 00:38.570
     THIS MAN FOUND A WAY       
          TO OVERCOME           

00:38.638 --> 00:40.906
         ANY OBSTACLE           
     THAT GOT IN HIS WAY.       

00:40.974 --> 00:43.175
         1916 TO 1918,          

00:43.243 --> 00:45.844
 HE MANAGED TO UNITE THE ARABS  
          IN A REVOLT           

00:45.912 --> 00:48.747
THAT ALLOWS THE BRITISH EMPIRE  

00:48.815 --> 00:52.151
 TO DEFEAT THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE   
     AND WIN WORLD WAR I.       

00:52.218 --> 00:54.053
      - THE TIME PERIODS        
  AT WHICH THEY WERE FIGHTING   

00:54.120 --> 00:55.821
         WERE ACTUALLY          
    FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER.      

00:55.889 --> 00:58.690
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT        
  OF SIMILAR TYPE OF WEAPONS.   

00:58.758 --> 01:00.592
    ROOSEVELT'S GATLING GUN     
        COULD SPIT OUT          

01:00.660 --> 01:02.594
    900 ROUNDS PER MINUTE.      

01:02.662 --> 01:04.962
      VERSUS THE VICKERS.       

01:05.031 --> 01:06.465
      I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE       
    THESE TWO WEAPONS           

01:06.533 --> 01:07.833
    GO HEAD-TO-HEAD.            

01:07.901 --> 01:09.668
    - THESE ARE TWO DYNAMIC     
          CHARACTERS.           

01:09.736 --> 01:11.270
     BOTH PHYSICALLY FIT,       

01:11.337 --> 01:13.372
 BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY STRONG.   

01:13.440 --> 01:15.474
    IT'S THE ULTIMATE TEST      
     OF THE TOUGHEST GUY.       

01:15.542 --> 01:17.743
- THESE ARE TWO BRILLIANT GUYS. 

01:17.811 --> 01:19.144
    THEY'RE GREAT WARRIORS.     

01:19.212 --> 01:21.413
      I'M EXCITED TO SEE        
    HOW THIS THING UNFOLDS.

         ROUGH RIDERS           

01:26.086 --> 01:28.387

     THAT TURNED THE TIDE       

01:28.455 --> 01:30.255
 OF THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.   

01:30.323 --> 01:31.256

    U.S. ARMY COLONEL

02:58.878 --> 03:01.146
        BEFORE BECOMING         
      THE 26TH PRESIDENT.       

03:01.214 --> 03:03.315
    - AS A PHYSICIAN,           
    I WANT TO BREAK IT DOWN     

03:03.383 --> 03:04.683
  WITH THE TALE OF THE TAPE.    

03:04.751 --> 03:06.785
        IN THEIR PRIME,         
      WE HAVE ROOSEVELT,

     80-POUND DIFFERENCE.       

03:16.763 --> 03:18.730
  ROOSEVELT, AT A YOUNG AGE,    
     HE HAD SEVERE ASTHMA,      

03:18.798 --> 03:20.732
          AS WELL AS            
     SEVERE VISION ISSUES.      

03:20.800 --> 03:21.967
    BUT HE TRAINED HEAVILY.     

03:22.035 --> 03:23.535
    THE GUY WAS FIT.            

03:23.603 --> 03:24.803
         THEN YOU HAVE          
      LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.       

03:24.871 --> 03:27.206
      HE COULD RUN A MILE       
      UNDER FIVE MINUTES.       

03:27.273 --> 03:28.907
    HE DIDN'T DRINK.            
    HE DIDN'T SMOKE.            

03:28.975 --> 03:31.610
 THIS GUY WAS IN GREAT SHAPE.   

03:31.678 --> 03:33.679
    - DOC, I THINK YOU MAKE     
        A GREAT POINT.          

03:33.746 --> 03:34.680
     LAWRENCE IS SPECIAL.       

03:34.747 --> 03:35.981
  HE SPEAKS SEVEN LANGUAGES.    

03:36.049 --> 03:38.450
  A STUDENT OF ARCHITECTURE.    

03:38.518 --> 03:41.286
    THIS MAN WANDERED           
  THROUGH ALL THE MIDDLE EAST   

03:41.354 --> 03:42.988
         JUST TO PROVE          
 HE WAS TOUGH ENOUGH TO DO IT.  

03:43.056 --> 03:44.990
    ROOSEVELT, HE WAS           
    THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY     

03:45.058 --> 03:45.958
         OF THE NAVY.           

03:46.025 --> 03:48.427
    HE RESIGNS HIS POSITION     

03:48.494 --> 03:51.029
        SO HE CAN FIGHT         
 IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.   

03:51.097 --> 03:53.632
    PHYSICALLY TOUGH,           
        MENTALLY TOUGH,         

03:53.700 --> 03:55.167
      AND ABLE TO EXECUTE       
     WHEN IT MATTERED MOST      

03:55.235 --> 03:56.268
    ON A BATTLEFIELD.           

03:56.336 --> 03:57.636

     MOVING ON TO RIFLES.       

04:06.012 --> 04:07.913
          WHAT I LOVE           
      ABOUT THESE WEAPONS       

04:07.981 --> 04:09.281
     IS THAT THEY'RE BOTH       
         BOLT-ACTION.           

04:09.349 --> 04:10.983
     WE'VE GOT SOME PRETTY      
INTERESTING TESTS SET UP        

04:11.050 --> 04:12.251

 AND BECAUSE THEY'RE LEADERS,   

04:46.719 --> 04:48.353
     WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM       
     IN A LEADERSHIP ROLE.

HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD.  

05:27.360 --> 05:28.960

06:10.603 --> 06:13.271

  BECAUSE HE WAS EVEN TOUGHER   

06:13.339 --> 06:15.374

         EFFECTIVELY,           

06:28.654 --> 06:31.022
AND HE GOT OUT OF THE WAY       
 AS SOON AS THE JOB WAS DONE.   

06:31.090 --> 06:32.190
        HE WOULD VANISH         
        INTO THE DESERT

        A GREAT WARRIOR         

07:05.992 --> 07:07.292
 WAS HIS LEADERSHIP ABILITIES.  

07:07.360 --> 07:08.627
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS        
          THAT YOU DO           

07:08.694 --> 07:10.228
     IN A BATTLE SITUATION      

07:10.296 --> 07:12.998

     WOULDN'T WANT TO DO,       

07:13.065 --> 07:14.666
     AND COLONEL ROOSEVELT      
        DID THEM.

      MILITARY HISTORIAN        
AND ARMORER GARY HARPER.        

07:21.841 --> 07:22.974
  - THEODORE ROOSEVELT SAID,    

07:23.042 --> 07:24.342
  "THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO    

07:24.410 --> 07:27.245
  "IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION    
      IS THE RIGHT THING.

YOU CAN DO IS THE WRONG THING.  

07:29.582 --> 07:32.083
  THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO    
      IS NOTHING AT ALL."       

07:32.151 --> 07:34.419
TEDDY ROOSEVELT NEVER DID       
        NOTHING AT ALL.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.492
         HAS ITS ROOTS          
    IN HIS CHILDHOOD.           

07:40.560 --> 07:41.893
      - HE HAD THE STIGMA       
         OF BELIEVING           

07:41.961 --> 07:43.528
 THAT HIS FATHER WAS A COWARD   
     DURING THE CIVIL WAR       

07:43.596 --> 07:45.230
      FOR BUYING HIS WAY        
        OUT OF SERVICE,         

07:45.298 --> 07:46.998
      AND IT HAUNTED HIM.       

07:47.066 --> 07:49.267
  HE NEEDED TO PROVE HIMSELF    
        FOR HIS HONOR.          

07:49.335 --> 07:50.802
        narrator:               
         AS AN ADULT,           

07:50.870 --> 07:53.238
    ROOSEVELT WAS A DEVOTED     
        PUBLIC SERVANT.         

07:53.306 --> 07:55.474
        IN 1898,                
        HE WAS SERVING

    IN HAVANA HARBOR            

08:00.046 --> 08:01.780
    ON SPANISH-RULED CUBA.      

08:01.848 --> 08:03.882
     AMERICA DECLARED WAR       
        ON SPAIN,               

08:03.950 --> 08:05.750
         AND ROOSEVELT          
     GAVE UP HIS DESK JOB       

08:05.818 --> 08:07.285
      TO JOIN THE FIGHT.        

08:07.353 --> 08:09.421
        HE HAND-PICKED          
    HIS OWN ARMY UNIT           

08:09.489 --> 08:12.491
    AND CALLED IT THE FIRST     
U.S. VOLUNTEER CAVALRY REGIMENT.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.759
     THE PRESS NAMED THEM       
    THE ROUGH RIDERS.           

08:14.827 --> 08:17.362
     - HE WANTED SOMETHING      
        THAT EPITOMIZED         

08:17.430 --> 08:18.964
    THE NATURE OF AMERICA.      

08:19.031 --> 08:20.665
    SO HE WAS GIVING PEOPLE     

08:20.733 --> 08:22.634
FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT        
         WALKS OF LIFE          

08:22.702 --> 08:23.869
A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE,        

08:23.936 --> 08:25.770
FROM HARVARD AND YALE STUDENTS  

08:25.838 --> 08:28.006
         TO THE DREGS           
        OF THE STREETS,         

08:28.074 --> 08:30.308
  FROM COWBOYS TO STATESMEN.    

08:30.376 --> 08:32.143
narrator: FROM THE MOMENT       
        THEY HIT CUBA,          

08:32.211 --> 08:33.945
    THE ROUGH RIDERS            
    WERE OVERWHELMED            

08:34.013 --> 08:35.614
    BY TROPICAL HEAT            
         AND DISEASE.           

08:35.681 --> 08:38.817
    WITH HIS LOYAL SOLDIERS     
  GROWING WEAKER BY THE HOUR,   

08:38.885 --> 08:41.520
        ROOSEVELT KNEW          
HE HAD TO STRIKE HARD AND FAST  

08:41.587 --> 08:44.022
        OR BE WIPED OUT         
         BY THE ENEMY.          

08:44.090 --> 08:45.790
  THE OPPOSING SPANISH FORCES   
        WERE ENTRENCHED         

08:45.858 --> 08:48.393
IN HEAVILY FORTIFIED POSITIONS  

08:48.461 --> 08:49.694
          AT THE TOP            
    OF SAN JUAN HILL.           

08:49.762 --> 08:51.363
ROOSEVELT RALLIED HIS MEN       

08:51.430 --> 08:53.331
      AND FEARLESSLY LED        
    THE ROUGH RIDERS            

08:53.399 --> 08:54.799
    INTO A HAIL OF BULLETS.     

08:54.867 --> 08:55.967
    THE STRATEGIC POSITION      
         WAS CAPTURED,          

08:56.035 --> 08:58.203
      A LEGEND WAS BORN,        

08:58.271 --> 09:00.138
AND AMERICA'S REPUTATION        
    AS A WORLD POWER            

09:00.206 --> 09:01.907
         WAS SECURED.           

09:01.974 --> 09:05.544
    - ROOSEVELT KNEW            
THAT IN ORDER TO BE THAT POWER, 

09:05.611 --> 09:06.845
      WE HAD TO EXHIBIT,        
        DISPLAY,                

09:06.913 --> 09:09.014
     AND PROVE THAT POWER.      

09:09.081 --> 09:11.082
        narrator:               
  BOTH LAWRENCE AND ROOSEVELT   

09:11.150 --> 09:13.552
  USED MODERNIZED LONG-RANGE,   
      RAPID-FIRE WEAPONS        

09:13.619 --> 09:14.886
  TO MOW DOWN THEIR ENEMIES.    

09:14.954 --> 09:16.855
NOW THESE DEATH MACHINES        
        WILL BE TESTED          

09:16.923 --> 09:17.989
      AGAINST EACH OTHER,       

09:18.057 --> 09:20.225
        SHOT FOR SHOT,          
        KILL FOR KILL.          

09:20.293 --> 09:21.927
        ROOSEVELT               
     TOOK OUT THE SPANISH       

09:21.994 --> 09:24.963
     WITH THE GATLING GUN,      

09:25.031 --> 09:26.932
    MECHANIZED MAYHEM           
     THAT FIRST SAW BATTLE      

09:26.999 --> 09:28.667
    IN THE CIVIL WAR.           

09:28.734 --> 09:30.001
      - THE GATLING GUN.        

09:30.069 --> 09:31.703
 PURELY AN AMERICAN INVENTION.  

09:31.771 --> 09:34.539
    TEN BARRELS, TEN BOLTS,     
    TEN FIRING PINS.            

09:34.607 --> 09:35.674
      IT'S HAND-CRANKED.        

09:35.741 --> 09:36.641
         YOU CAN REACH          
         RATES OF FIRE          

09:36.709 --> 09:38.109
 OF UP TO 900 ROUNDS A MINUTE.  

09:38.177 --> 09:41.279
        IN 1968,                
 THIS WEAPON WAS RECONSTITUTED  

09:41.347 --> 09:42.581
        AS THE MINI-GUN         
      ON OUR HELICOPTERS.       

09:42.648 --> 09:43.815
IT WAS ACTUALLY INVENTED        

09:43.883 --> 09:45.250
          BY A DOCTOR           
     DURING THE CIVIL WAR.      

09:45.318 --> 09:47.152
  DR. RICHARD JORDAN GATLING    

09:47.219 --> 09:49.087
         THOUGHT IF HE          
     COULD INVENT A WEAPON      

09:49.155 --> 09:51.056
    THAT WOULD FIRE AS FAST     
AS A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS,       

09:51.123 --> 09:52.424
      THEY WOULDN'T DRAFT       
          SO MANY MEN           

09:52.491 --> 09:54.492
AND SEND THEM OFF TO WAR.       

09:54.560 --> 09:56.895
      - SO IT'S BASICALLY       
  LIKE TEN BOLT-ACTION RIFLES   

09:56.963 --> 09:58.363
  WORKING TOGETHER IN CONCERT   
     OVER AND OVER AGAIN.       

09:58.431 --> 10:00.231
 - YES, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO  
         TO CLEAN IT,           

10:00.299 --> 10:02.200
     YOU REALIZE IT'S TEN       
      BOLT-ACTION RIFLES.       

10:02.268 --> 10:03.401
          - PERFECT.            

10:03.469 --> 10:05.203
      - HERE'S THE TEST.        

10:05.271 --> 10:06.605
  IT'S A DEFENSIVE SCENARIO.    

10:06.672 --> 10:08.840
YOU HAVE THE HIGH GROUND.       
    YOU MUST KEEP IT.

          250 ROUNDS            

10:13.346 --> 10:16.848

    15 STATIC TROOPS            

10:16.916 --> 10:18.950

10:19.018 --> 10:20.352

10:20.419 --> 10:22.487
      ROOSEVELT EXPERTS,        
    YOU'RE UP FIRST.            

10:22.555 --> 10:25.824

10:25.891 --> 10:30.161
        CRANK 'EM OUT!          

10:30.229 --> 10:31.796
      - THAT IS AWESOME.        

10:31.864 --> 10:33.198
    - THAT'S AWESOME.           

10:33.265 --> 10:35.834
            - YEAH.

         HOLY [bleep].          

10:39.338 --> 10:42.774
     [shooting continues]       

10:42.842 --> 10:44.976
      YOU WOULD NOT WANT        
         TO BE RUNNING          

10:45.044 --> 10:47.045
     INTO THAT THING, MAN.      

10:47.113 --> 10:49.481
      HO, HO, HO, HO, HO.       

10:49.548 --> 10:50.482
         - YEAH, BABY!          

10:50.549 --> 10:53.852
            - OHHH!             

10:53.919 --> 10:55.587
    WHOA, HO, HO, HO.           

10:55.655 --> 10:57.122
    - YEP, THAT'S IT.           

10:57.189 --> 11:00.892
 - TIME, 1 MINUTE, 11 SECONDS.  
            - WOW.              

11:00.960 --> 11:02.827
    - FIRST MOVING TARGET,      

11:02.895 --> 11:04.729
          YOU'VE GOT            
  MULTIPLE ROUNDS DELIVERED.    

11:04.797 --> 11:06.264
    THROUGH THE FACE, JAW,      

11:06.332 --> 11:08.099
      THROUGH THE CHEST,        
      CENTER OF THE MASS.       

11:08.167 --> 11:09.367
 I MEAN, THIS IS INSTANT KILL.  

11:09.435 --> 11:11.302
          NUMBER TWO,           
    BEAUTIFUL DEMONSTRATION     

11:11.370 --> 11:14.072
      OF MULTIPLE ROUNDS,       
      ALL CENTER OF MASS.       

11:14.140 --> 11:15.907
 YOU'RE IN DOUBLE DIGITS HERE   
          ON ONE GUY.           

11:15.975 --> 11:17.876
    OH, WOW, LOOK AT THIS.      

11:17.943 --> 11:20.045
  STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CHEST,   
    FRACTURED THAT STERNUM.     

11:20.112 --> 11:21.646
MULTIPLE ROUNDS DELIVERED       
         IN THE BELLY.          

11:21.714 --> 11:22.781
THIS IS AN INSTANT KILL,        

11:22.848 --> 11:24.716
    AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT     
        TO DEMONSTRATE.         

11:24.784 --> 11:26.117
         - OKAY, GUYS,          
    LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE           

11:26.185 --> 11:27.519
        THREE FOR THREE         
    ON THE MOVING TARGETS,      

11:27.586 --> 11:28.586
  AND ON THE STATIC TARGETS,    

11:28.654 --> 11:31.656
  10 HITS OUT OF 15 TARGETS.    

11:31.724 --> 11:33.458
AT 1 MINUTE, 11 SECONDS.        

11:33.526 --> 11:34.926
    - IT REALLY COMES DOWN      

11:34.994 --> 11:37.028
      TO LOOKING AT THESE       
    CHARGING TARGETS.           

11:37.096 --> 11:39.097
 I IMAGINE IF YOU WERE COMING   
         UP THAT HILL           

11:39.165 --> 11:40.465
      BEHIND THESE GUYS,        

11:40.533 --> 11:42.500
AND YOU WERE LITERALLY WATCHING 
         GUY AFTER GUY          

11:42.568 --> 11:43.968
        GET MOWED DOWN,         

11:44.036 --> 11:47.539
THAT'S GONNA HAVE A HUGE        
  PSYCHOLOGICAL PLAY ON YOU.    

11:47.606 --> 11:49.908
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THAT SENSE 
     OF BEING INTIMIDATED       

11:49.975 --> 11:51.376
         AND DOMINATED          
     ON THAT BATTLE SPACE,      

11:51.444 --> 11:53.745
    AND I THINK THOSE           
  ARE GONNA BE BIG X FACTORS    

11:53.813 --> 11:55.080
     THAT WE'RE GONNA PLUG      
         INTO THE SIM.          

11:55.147 --> 11:56.915
    - WHEN I STARTED SEEING     
THE HOLES AND THE BLOOD,        

11:56.982 --> 11:58.883
IT BECAME LIKE SQUIRTING        
         A WATER HOSE.          

11:58.951 --> 12:00.452
    THERE'S NO RECOIL           
          ON THE GUN.           

12:00.519 --> 12:02.721
     IT'S GONNA DO EXACTLY      
     WHAT I WANT IT TO DO.      

12:02.788 --> 12:04.589
THERE'S THE EERIE FEELING       
        I HAVE TO SHOOT         

12:04.657 --> 12:06.357
    THROUGH THE DEAD BODIES     
    TO GET TO THE LIVE ONES     

12:06.425 --> 12:07.625
  AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL.    

12:07.693 --> 12:08.960
- IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE GUN.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.995
  I THINK IT WOULD LOOK GREAT   
          IN A MUSEUM           

12:11.063 --> 12:11.996
        OR AT A PARADE.         

12:12.064 --> 12:13.364
    BUT LAWRENCE'S VICKERS      

12:13.432 --> 12:14.733
    IS 50 YEARS NEWER           

12:14.800 --> 12:15.767
    AND 50 TIMES AS DEADLY.

    narrator: COMING UP...      

12:17.103 --> 12:19.037

12:19.105 --> 12:20.472

         FROM FICTION

  TO REVEAL THE LETHAL POWER    
OF TWO LEGENDARY WEAPONS.       

12:26.679 --> 12:29.114
AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE       
 IN THE CHAOS OF CLOSE COMBAT.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.796
 ...VERSUS LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,  

12:44.864 --> 12:47.999
  THE FEARLESS DESERT WARRIOR   
        OF WORLD WAR I.         

12:48.067 --> 12:51.236
  HE DIVIDED, THEN DESTROYED    
    HIS TURKISH ENEMY           

12:51.303 --> 12:54.405
WITH A BRILLIANT STRATEGY       
    OF DIVERSIONARY ATTACKS     

12:54.473 --> 12:56.641
      AGAINST THEIR VITAL       
  HEJAZ RAILWAY SUPPLY LINE.    

12:56.709 --> 12:58.409
  - IT WOULD'VE BEEN TEMPTING   
    TO DESTROY THE RAILWAY.     

12:58.477 --> 13:00.311
        BUT HE REALIZED         
      THAT BY BLOWING UP        

13:00.379 --> 13:02.280
    INDIVIDUAL TRAINS           

13:02.348 --> 13:04.215
AND GIVING THE TURKS TIME       
         TO REPAIR IT,          

13:04.283 --> 13:06.384
        THERE WOULD BE          
    A CONSTANT SUPPLY           

13:06.452 --> 13:09.888
 OF TRAINS AND TROOPS AND LOOT  
     COMING DOWN THAT LINE      

13:09.955 --> 13:12.423
    THAT HE COULD PICK OFF      
        AT WILL.                

13:12.491 --> 13:14.192
     SO BY NOT COMPLETELY       
        DESTROYING IT,          

13:14.260 --> 13:16.027
     BUT BY DISRUPTING IT,      
    HE KEPT DRAINING            

13:16.095 --> 13:18.730
     THE TURKISH MANPOWER       
     AND TURKISH RESOURCES      

13:18.798 --> 13:21.599
  INTO A USELESS ENTERPRISE.    

13:21.667 --> 13:23.434
        narrator:               
    THIS LEGENDARY SHOWDOWN     

13:23.502 --> 13:26.471
  KICKED OFF WITH ROOSEVELT'S   
 LONG-RANGE WEAPON OF CHOICE,   

13:26.539 --> 13:27.539
    THE GATLING GUN.            

13:27.606 --> 13:29.774
    NOW LAWRENCE OF ARABIA      
          FIRES BACK            

13:29.842 --> 13:31.342
         WITH HIS OWN           
      RAPID-FIRE KILLER,        

13:31.410 --> 13:33.044
         THE VICKERS.           

13:33.112 --> 13:34.579
      THE BRITISH ARMY'S        
      PRIMARY MACHINE GUN       

13:34.647 --> 13:36.281
    FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS      

13:36.348 --> 13:38.650
        SERVED UP DEATH         
    AT 500 ROUNDS A MINUTE.     

13:38.717 --> 13:41.719
      - THE VICKERS MADE        
ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO LAWRENCE  

13:41.787 --> 13:43.421
BECAUSE HE WAS UP AGAINST       
        SUPERIOR FORCES         

13:43.489 --> 13:45.423
     IN TERMS OF NUMBERS.       

13:45.491 --> 13:46.891
    AND HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE     

13:46.959 --> 13:49.027
     HIS IRREGULAR FORCES       

13:49.094 --> 13:51.796
      A POWERFUL WEAPON,        
    WHICH EVENED THE ODDS.      

13:51.864 --> 13:53.965
- IT FIRES A .303 ROUND.        

13:54.033 --> 13:55.300
    BY COOLING THE SYSTEM,      

13:55.367 --> 13:57.202
YOU COULD DO MUCH LONGER BURSTS 
        OF FIRE.                

13:57.269 --> 13:59.571
     WATER WOULD BE PUT IN      
    THROUGH THIS TAP            

13:59.638 --> 14:01.973
AND DRAINED OUT THROUGH THIS TAP
          AT THE END.           

14:02.041 --> 14:03.141
      BUT IN THE DESERT,        

14:03.209 --> 14:04.642
      WATER IS OBVIOUSLY        
    IN SHORT SUPPLY.            

14:04.710 --> 14:06.811
    SO IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF      

14:06.879 --> 14:09.080
    FOR SOLDIERS TO URINATE     
      FOR IT TO OPERATE.        

14:09.148 --> 14:10.815
    BUT THE URIC ACID           
WOULD ACTUALLY BE VERY DAMAGING 

14:10.883 --> 14:12.183
      TO THE GUN ITSELF.        

14:12.251 --> 14:14.385
- ALSO, URINATING UNDER PRESSURE
      IS VERY DIFFICULT.        

14:14.453 --> 14:15.687
          [laughter]            

14:15.754 --> 14:17.222
- AND THEN THERE'S THAT.

            - JAM.              

14:42.748 --> 14:44.082

          [laughter]

        NICE AND SLOW.          

14:52.625 --> 14:54.525
     - OHHHH, YEAH, BABY.       

14:54.593 --> 14:56.828
      NOW WE'RE TALKIN'.        

14:59.131 --> 15:00.765

15:00.833 --> 15:02.934
        EASY PICKINGS.

        CHECK THAT OUT.         

15:10.209 --> 15:11.576
             OHHH.              

15:11.644 --> 15:14.412

        YOU SHOOT THAT,         
THEY'RE GONNA BLEED OUT,        

15:25.925 --> 15:27.525
DROP THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE       
    IN A FEW SECONDS,           

15:27.593 --> 15:29.060
        BE UNCONSCIOUS,         
        AND DIE.                

15:29.128 --> 15:30.561
         - AND TALKING          
     ABOUT A JUICY AORTA,       

15:30.629 --> 15:31.896
        CHECK THAT OUT.         

15:31.964 --> 15:34.666
      THE JACKET ON THIS        
  IS COMPLETELY PEELED BACK.    

15:34.733 --> 15:35.700
          THIS GOING            
    THROUGH YOUR BODY           

15:35.768 --> 15:37.135
        IS A LOT                
    OF TRANSFERRED ENERGY.      

15:37.202 --> 15:38.336
          - EXACTLY.            

15:38.404 --> 15:39.671
    YOU SEE ALL THESE           
    LITTLE FRAGMENTS?           

15:39.738 --> 15:41.105
    IT'S NOT A SMOOTH           
         LITTLE CIRCLE          

15:41.173 --> 15:42.173
  THAT WE THINK OF A BULLET.    

15:42.241 --> 15:43.875
IT'S JUST TEARING AWAY TISSUE.  

15:43.943 --> 15:45.276
- AND TALKING ABOUT THE VICKERS,

15:45.344 --> 15:47.312
    YOU'RE THREE FOR THREE      
    ON THE MOVING TARGETS,      

15:47.379 --> 15:50.014
    AND I COUNTED 11 FOR 15     
     ON THE STATIC TARGETS      

15:50.082 --> 15:52.350
IN 1 MINUTE, 41 SECONDS.        

15:52.418 --> 15:56.254
  - AS SOON AS I OPENED FIRE,   
I ENCOUNTERED A BLOCKAGE.       

15:56.322 --> 15:58.022
      AS SOON AS THE GUN        
        WAS CORRECTED,          

15:58.090 --> 16:00.491
  I CAN QUITE CASUALLY RELAX    
     AND PICK OFF TARGETS.      

16:00.559 --> 16:01.960
    AND I HAD A LONG BURST      
        OF FIRE.                

16:02.027 --> 16:03.962
- FOR ALL THE CHALLENGES        
    WE FOUND WITH IT,           

16:04.029 --> 16:05.430
  THIS WEAPON DID DO THE JOB    

16:05.497 --> 16:06.831
         THAT LAWRENCE          
    NEEDED IT TO DO.            

16:06.899 --> 16:08.633
    IT WIPED OUT THE TURKS      
 WHO WERE STANDING IN HIS WAY.  

16:08.701 --> 16:10.301
    IT ENABLED HIM TO WIN.      

16:10.369 --> 16:11.469
- WITH ALL SAID AND DONE,       

16:11.537 --> 16:12.637
    YOU'VE GOT ONE BARREL.      

16:12.705 --> 16:13.838
      YOU HAD A FEW JAMS.       

16:13.906 --> 16:15.440
     BUT YOU COULDN'T FIRE      
          THAT WEAPON           

16:15.507 --> 16:17.241
UNTIL YOU CLEARED THAT BARREL.  

16:17.309 --> 16:19.177
     WITH THE GATLING GUN,      
    WE'VE GOT TEN BARRELS.      

16:19.244 --> 16:21.646
     IF I HAVE A PROBLEM,       
    I CAN PULL A BOLT           

16:21.714 --> 16:23.881
      AND CONTINUE FIRING       
 WITH THE OTHER NINE BARRELS.   

16:23.949 --> 16:25.083
        narrator:               
      LAWRENCE'S VICKERS        

16:25.150 --> 16:26.517
    HIT MORE TARGETS.           

16:26.585 --> 16:29.253
    BUT ROOSEVELT'S GATLING     
  WAS FASTER AND DIDN'T JAM.    

16:29.321 --> 16:32.323
    SO WHICH RAPID-FIRE GUN     
        GETS THE EDGE?          

16:32.391 --> 16:34.158
    - I HAVE TO ADMIT           
     I WAS GIVING MY EDGE       

16:34.226 --> 16:35.526
        TO THE VICKERS          
      RIGHT OFF THE BAT.        

16:35.594 --> 16:37.929
    I THOUGHT IT WAS            
  THE MORE RECENT TECHNOLOGY.   

16:37.997 --> 16:39.330
    BUT AFTER SEEING            
    THESE TWO TESTS,            

16:39.398 --> 16:42.200
  I'M LIKING THE GATLING GUN.   

16:42.267 --> 16:44.068
    - MULTIPLE ROUNDS           
        IN EACH TARGET,         

16:44.136 --> 16:45.603
        INSTANT KILLS.          

16:45.671 --> 16:46.938
     IT GOES TO SHOW YOU,       

16:47.006 --> 16:48.940
        IT WAS DESIGNED         
         BY A DOCTOR.           

16:49.008 --> 16:51.776
  - LISTEN, THAT GATLING GUN    
      WAS ALREADY PROVEN        

16:51.844 --> 16:53.945
      BY THE TIME IT GOT        
    INTO ROOSEVELT'S HANDS      

16:54.013 --> 16:55.146
 VERSUS A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY   

16:55.214 --> 16:56.981
     THAT HADN'T YET SEEN       
          ITS HEYDAY.           

16:57.049 --> 16:58.249
    I THINK, CLEARLY,           

16:58.317 --> 17:00.651
MY EDGE GOES TO THE GATLING GUN 
         ALL THE WAY.           

17:00.719 --> 17:02.220
        narrator:               
    FOR LONG-RANGE WEAPONS,     

17:02.287 --> 17:04.722
    EDGE: TEDDY ROOSEVELT.      

17:04.790 --> 17:08.126
  AS THE ENEMY WAS SUPPRESSED   
BY LONG-RANGE FIREPOWER,        

17:08.193 --> 17:10.528
BOTH LAWRENCE'S ARAB ARMY       
 AND ROOSEVELT'S ROUGH RIDERS   

17:10.596 --> 17:13.498
         WOULD ADVANCE          
WITH BOLT-ACTION RIFLES.        

17:13.565 --> 17:15.933
     LAWRENCE'S ARAB ARMY       
     TERRORIZED THE TURKS       

17:16.001 --> 17:18.669
    WITH THE S.M.L.E.           

17:18.737 --> 17:20.704
THE SHORT MAGAZINE LEE-ENFIELD  

17:20.772 --> 17:22.339
WAS THE BRITISH MILITARY        
        STANDARD ISSUE          

17:22.407 --> 17:24.442
      FOR OVER 50 YEARS.        

17:24.510 --> 17:26.778
      - THE MAIN BENEFIT        
         OF THIS RIFLE          

17:26.845 --> 17:28.980
         WAS THE SPEED          
      OF THE BOLT-ACTION.       

17:29.048 --> 17:31.382
TROOPS WERE ABLE TO COCK        
AND RELOAD THE NEXT ROUND       

17:31.450 --> 17:32.550
         VERY RAPIDLY,          

17:32.618 --> 17:35.153
    BETWEEN 25 TO 40 ROUNDS     
          PER MINUTE.           

17:35.220 --> 17:36.487
         SO IF YOU HAD          
    A SECTION OF MEN FIRING     

17:36.555 --> 17:37.855
        AT THAT SPEED,          

17:37.923 --> 17:40.525
     IT WAS OFTEN MISTAKEN      
     FOR MACHINE GUN FIRE.      

17:40.592 --> 17:42.560
        narrator:               
ROOSEVELT'S ROUGH RIDERS        

17:42.628 --> 17:44.162
    TAKE AIM WITH...            
            - UGH!              

17:44.229 --> 17:45.563
        narrator:               
        THE KRAG,               

17:45.631 --> 17:48.366
     THE U.S. ARMY'S FIRST      
SMOKELESS POWDER CARBINE.       

17:48.434 --> 17:49.834
         - VERY LIGHT,          
        VERY ACCURATE.          

17:49.902 --> 17:52.136
 SHOOTS THE .30-40 KRAG ROUND.  

17:52.204 --> 17:53.638
 FIVE-ROUND INTERNAL MAGAZINE,  

17:53.705 --> 17:55.006
OR YOU CAN SINGLE-SHOT IT       

17:55.074 --> 17:57.208
 THROUGH WHAT IS ACCLAIMED AS   
      THE SMOOTHEST BOLT        

17:57.276 --> 17:58.843
        EVER INVENTED.          

17:58.911 --> 18:00.812
        narrator:               
     THE KILLING CAPACITY       

18:00.879 --> 18:02.513
OF EACH BOLT-ACTION RIFLE       
        WILL BE TESTED          

18:02.581 --> 18:04.582
 BY MEASURING MUZZLE VELOCITY   
      AND TARGET DAMAGE.        

18:04.650 --> 18:06.717
         IN ADDITION,           
      GEOFF WILL MEASURE        

18:06.785 --> 18:08.953
  EACH WEAPON'S RECOIL FORCE,   

18:09.021 --> 18:11.222
    A KEY FACTOR THAT           
CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT ACCURACY. 

18:11.290 --> 18:13.091
 - WHEN YOU PULL THAT TRIGGER,  

18:13.158 --> 18:15.760
 YOU'VE GOT THE GASES PUSHING   
        ON THIS BULLET,         

18:15.828 --> 18:17.428
  PUSHING IT DOWN THE BARREL.   

18:17.496 --> 18:19.530
    BUT THERE'S AN OPPOSITE     
      AND REACTIVE FORCE        

18:19.598 --> 18:21.432
  TRAVELING THROUGH THE STOCK   

18:21.500 --> 18:23.668
        AND BACK                
INTO THIS MAN'S SHOULDER.       

18:23.735 --> 18:24.969
        narrator:               
     A LOAD CELL ATTACHED       

18:25.037 --> 18:26.304
TO THE BUTT OF EACH RIFLE       

18:26.371 --> 18:28.139
  WILL MEASURE RECOIL FORCE.    

18:28.207 --> 18:30.875
 EXPERTS WILL FIRE LIVE ROUNDS  
     THROUGH A CHRONOMETER      

18:30.943 --> 18:33.644
 INTO A BLOCK OF FBI-CERTIFIED  
        BALLISTICS CLAY         

18:33.712 --> 18:35.947
 TO DETERMINE MUZZLE VELOCITY   

18:36.014 --> 18:38.015
     AND GET AN ASSESSMENT      
    OF THE OVERALL DAMAGE.      

18:38.083 --> 18:39.884
      RICHARD'S UP FIRST,       

18:39.952 --> 18:42.086
  FIRING LAWRENCE OF ARABIA'S   
        S.M.L.E.                

18:42.154 --> 18:44.088
            - WHOO!             

18:44.156 --> 18:46.023
        narrator:               
     NEXT, QUAY TAKES AIM       

18:46.091 --> 18:47.425
WITH ROOSEVELT'S KRAG CARBINE.  

18:47.493 --> 18:49.427
            - NICE.             

18:49.495 --> 18:50.628
    MUZZLE VELOCITY.            

18:50.696 --> 18:51.629
    OFF THE S.M.L.E.,           

18:51.697 --> 18:55.166
 WE GOT 2,592 FEET PER SECOND.  

18:55.234 --> 18:58.870
    VERSUS THE KRAG,            
    1,958 FEET PER SECOND.      

18:58.937 --> 19:00.538
        narrator:               
A HIGHER MUZZLE VELOCITY        

19:00.606 --> 19:03.374
OFFERS POTENTIAL FOR MORE DAMAGE
        TO THE TARGET.          

19:03.442 --> 19:05.576
BUT GEOFF HAS TO EXAMINE        
      THE BALLISTICS CLAY       

19:05.644 --> 19:07.278
TO GET A COMPLETE PICTURE       

19:07.346 --> 19:09.046
        OF THE RIFLE'S          
      DESTRUCTIVE POWER.        

19:09.114 --> 19:12.116
      - LET'S TAKE A LOOK       
    AT QUAY WITH THE KRAG.      

19:12.184 --> 19:15.119
     AND WHAT I'M GETTING       
 OFF THE TEMPORARY CAVITY HERE  

19:15.187 --> 19:18.189
        IS FIVE INCHES          
     AT THE WIDEST POINT.       

19:18.257 --> 19:19.257
LOOKING AT THE S.M.L.E.,        

19:19.324 --> 19:21.159
  I'M MEASURING A FULL WIDTH    

19:21.226 --> 19:23.995
      OF THIS CLAY BLOCK,       
    WHICH IS 5 1/2 INCHES.      

19:24.062 --> 19:26.764
WE GOT A HIGHER MUZZLE VELOCITY 
    OFF RICHARD'S S.M.L.E.      

19:26.832 --> 19:30.668
      AND I'M SEEING HERE       
  A LARGER TEMPORARY CAVITY.    

19:30.736 --> 19:33.271
    SO IN MY OPINION,           
THE S.M.L.E. DOES MORE DAMAGE.  

19:33.338 --> 19:35.740
narrator: NEXT, GEOFF EXAMINES  
    THE LOAD CELL READINGS      

19:35.807 --> 19:37.975
         TO DETERMINE           
  EACH RIFLE'S RECOIL FORCE.    

19:38.043 --> 19:39.577
        - ON THE KRAG,          

19:39.645 --> 19:43.214
         ONLY A RECOIL          
     OF ABOUT NINE POUNDS.      

19:43.282 --> 19:44.649
    LET'S TAKE A LOOK           
        AT THE S.M.L.E.         

19:44.716 --> 19:46.083
     OKAY, BIG DIFFERENCE,      
        ACTUALLY.               

19:46.151 --> 19:48.386
OVER 37 POUNDS OF RECOIL.       

19:48.453 --> 19:50.721
    - THAT'S A HUGE FACTOR.     

19:50.789 --> 19:51.989
            I MEAN,             
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE BODY SIZE   

19:52.057 --> 19:53.024
    OF THESE TWO WARRIORS,      

19:53.091 --> 19:54.759
    YOU'VE GOT ROOSEVELT--      

19:54.826 --> 19:56.661
    HE IS 5'8", 210 POUNDS,     

19:56.728 --> 19:59.630
AND HE'S GOT THE LIGHTER RIFLE  
     WITH THE LESS RECOIL.      

19:59.698 --> 20:01.999
    THEN YOU TAKE LAWRENCE,     
      ON THE OTHER HAND,        

20:02.067 --> 20:04.936
    HE'S 5'5", 135 POUNDS.      

20:05.003 --> 20:08.606
  HE'S GOT THE HEAVIER WEAPON   
  WITH A MUCH LARGER RECOIL.    

20:08.674 --> 20:11.075
SOMEBODY CONSTANTLY TAKES RECOIL
      INTO THEIR SHOULDER       

20:11.143 --> 20:12.510
    IN A DRAWN-OUT BATTLE,      

20:12.578 --> 20:13.744
THAT'S GONNA BE A FACTOR.       

20:13.812 --> 20:15.279
    AND THAT'S AN X FACTOR      

20:15.347 --> 20:16.714
WITH REGARDS TO ENDURANCE       
        AND PHYSICALITY         

20:16.782 --> 20:17.715
 THAT WE CAN PUT INTO THE SIM.  

20:17.783 --> 20:18.883
  - LET'S NOT FORGET, THOUGH,   

20:18.951 --> 20:20.051
         THAT LAWRENCE          
      WAS SUPREMELY FIT.        

20:20.118 --> 20:21.352
 THIS WAS A GUY WHO COULD RUN   

20:21.420 --> 20:22.687
    A SUB-FIVE-MINUTE MILE.     

20:22.754 --> 20:24.055
     IF ANYONE COULD TAKE

        LAWRENCE COULD.         

20:26.458 --> 20:28.726

    WITH THIS WEAPON.           

20:28.794 --> 20:30.261
        BUT AS YOU SAW,         
    IT CAUSES MORE DAMAGE.      

20:30.329 --> 20:31.729
    - THE KRAG IS BEAUTIFUL     
        TO SHOOT.               

20:31.797 --> 20:33.598
THAT KICK THAT IT GIVES?        
        CHILDISH.               

20:33.665 --> 20:36.300

    ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING      
AMERICA'S 26TH PRESIDENT.       

21:16.875 --> 21:18.909
      - HE HAD A SAYING.        

21:18.977 --> 21:21.178
    HE WOULD RATHER GO DOWN     
      IN GLORIOUS DEFEAT        

21:21.246 --> 21:24.649
     THAN SHARE THE RANKS       
    WITH THOSE TIMID SOULS      

21:24.716 --> 21:26.984
THAT KNEW NEITHER VICTORY

     WHERE THE ACTION WAS,

          UNDER FIRE.           

24:24.496 --> 24:26.597
- WHAT REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO  
    IS THE TRAINING.            

24:26.665 --> 24:28.299
        ROOSEVELT'S MEN         
    WERE VERY WELL TRAINED      

24:28.366 --> 24:29.433
     WITH THESE CARBINES.

     WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.909
    - THAT IS A HIT.            

25:44.976 --> 25:46.143
            - TIME!             

25:46.211 --> 25:48.245
- 2 MINUTES, 15 SECONDS.        
          NICE WORK.            

25:48.313 --> 25:50.748
    - EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.     
          EXCELLENT.            

25:50.815 --> 25:52.182
    - THIS BY ITSELF            
      IS AN INSTANT KILL.       

25:52.250 --> 25:54.118
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET THE        
TRACHEA, MAYBE NOT RUPTURE IT,  

25:54.185 --> 25:55.819
      BUT YOU'LL TEAR IT.       
          IT'LL LEAK.           

25:55.887 --> 25:59.156
    THIS GUY IS UNTOUCHED.      
      HE LIVES TO FIGHT.        

25:59.224 --> 26:01.225
        narrator:               
     RICHARD KILLED SEVEN       

26:01.293 --> 26:02.459
     OUT OF EIGHT TARGETS.      

26:02.527 --> 26:03.894
    HE SCORED 14 HITS           
         WITH 20 SHOTS          

26:03.962 --> 26:05.029
    FROM THE S.M.L.E.           

26:05.096 --> 26:07.932
     TOTAL HIT RATIO, 70%.      

26:07.999 --> 26:09.733
 - WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE,  
     IT CAN BE DIFFICULT.       

26:09.801 --> 26:11.702
ESPECIALLY WITH THE HEAVY       
        ARTILLERY FIRE          

26:11.770 --> 26:14.171
      THAT WAS SIMULATED        
    IN THIS EXERCISE.           

26:14.239 --> 26:15.839
      BUT THE GREAT THING       
     WAS THE BOLT ACTION.       

26:15.907 --> 26:17.975
 IT MEANT THAT YOU COULD FIRE   
 YOUR TEN ROUNDS VERY QUICKLY.  

26:18.043 --> 26:19.743
         - ONCE AGAIN,          
I THINK THE KRAG PROVED ITSELF. 

26:19.811 --> 26:20.978
  LIGHTER, MORE MANEUVERABLE,   

26:21.046 --> 26:23.047
      ALL EIGHT TARGETS,        
        INSTANT KILLS.          

26:23.114 --> 26:24.582
        narrator:               
      LAWRENCE'S S.M.L.E.       

26:24.649 --> 26:27.918
      CAUSED MORE DAMAGE        
 AND HAD A FASTER RELOAD TIME.  

26:27.986 --> 26:30.988
  BUT ROOSEVELT'S KRAG PROVED   
        MORE ACCURATE,          

26:31.056 --> 26:33.290
        WITH A QUARTER          
OF THE S.M.L.E.'S RECOIL.       

26:33.358 --> 26:36.493
  SO WHICH BOLT-ACTION RIFLE    
        GETS THE EDGE?          

26:36.561 --> 26:39.663
- ON THE CONTROLLED TEST,       
     I LIKED THE S.M.L.E.       

26:39.731 --> 26:42.466
    BECAUSE THERE WAS           
      MORE DAMAGE THERE.        

26:42.534 --> 26:44.768
     MOVING TO THE DYNAMIC      
  SHOOTING ENVIRONMENT TEST,    

26:44.836 --> 26:46.470
 I LIKED THE S.M.L.E. AS WELL.  

26:46.538 --> 26:48.939
      HE WAS ABLE TO MOVE       
      THROUGH IT FASTER--       

26:49.007 --> 26:51.275
     2 MINUTES, 15 SECONDS      
VERSUS 2 MINUTES, 26 SECONDS--  

26:51.343 --> 26:52.409
    BECAUSE HE'S GOT            

26:52.477 --> 26:54.178
     A TEN-ROUND MAGAZINE       
        ON THIS WEAPON.         

26:54.245 --> 26:56.447
 - THE RIFLE THAT ACTUALLY HIT  
        THE RIGHT SPOT          

26:56.514 --> 26:58.349
      EVERY SINGLE TIME,        

26:58.416 --> 27:00.117
        WHETHER IT WAS          
    IN THE CONTROLLED STUDY     

27:00.185 --> 27:01.852
        OR ON THE FIELD         
     IN THE DYNAMIC STUDY,      

27:01.920 --> 27:03.654
         WAS THE KRAG.          

27:03.722 --> 27:04.955
      WITH THE S.M.L.E.,        

27:05.023 --> 27:07.358
THE RECOIL IS SO MUCH GREATER.  

27:07.425 --> 27:09.893
    NOW, YOU PUT THAT           
      IN A LONG GUNFIGHT,       

27:09.961 --> 27:11.729
  THAT'S GONNA START WEARING    
    ON YOUR SHOULDER.           

27:11.796 --> 27:12.630
     YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE      
     THE PERFECT POSITION       

27:12.697 --> 27:13.664
        AFTER A WHILE.          

27:13.732 --> 27:15.199
    - WITH THE KRAG,            

27:15.266 --> 27:17.468
     YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       
AN ADVANTAGE WITH FUNCTIONALITY.

27:17.535 --> 27:19.203
      WITH THE S.M.L.E.,        
     YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       

27:19.270 --> 27:20.337
         AN ADVANTAGE           
    WITH TECHNOLOGY.            

27:20.405 --> 27:22.072
    IT'S BASICALLY A WASH.      

27:22.140 --> 27:23.440
    TO ME, IT'S EVEN.           

27:23.508 --> 27:25.643
          (announcer)           
  - FOR MEDIUM-RANGE WEAPONS,   

27:25.710 --> 27:27.144
        IT'S DEAD EVEN.         

27:27.212 --> 27:28.646
          UP NEXT...            

27:28.713 --> 27:30.247
     WITH ROOSEVELT AHEAD,      

27:30.315 --> 27:31.782
         CAN LAWRENCE           
        EVEN THE SCORE          

27:31.850 --> 27:33.784
 WITH HIS CLOSE-RANGE KILLER?   

27:33.852 --> 27:35.753
        AND MACK JUMPS          
    INTO THE TRENCHES           

27:35.820 --> 27:37.021
OF TWO GREAT VICTORIES--        

27:37.088 --> 27:39.089
      ROOSEVELT'S CHARGE        
      UP SAN JUAN HILL...       

27:39.157 --> 27:40.224
    - WE'RE GONNA DIE           
    IF WE STAY HERE.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.127
     AT THE PORT OF AQABA.      

27:43.194 --> 27:44.928
     - THIS IS A COMPLETE       
     DIVERSIONARY TACTIC.       

27:44.996 --> 27:46.964
        narrator:               
        TEDDY ROOSEVELT         

27:47.032 --> 27:48.632
    OR LAWRENCE OF ARABIA?      

27:48.700 --> 27:50.034
    WHO IS DEADLIEST?           

27:53.872 --> 27:55.039
        narrator:               
      LAWRENCE OF ARABIA        

27:55.106 --> 27:57.274
    VERSUS TEDDY ROOSEVELT.     

27:57.342 --> 27:59.510
    MACK WILL EXAMINE           
    THE BATTLEFIELD TACTICS     

27:59.577 --> 28:01.578
         OF THESE TWO           
      LEGENDARY LEADERS,        

28:01.646 --> 28:03.747
    A CRUCIAL X FACTOR USED     
 BY THE DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE   

28:03.815 --> 28:07.217
    TO HELP DETERMINE WHICH     
COMBAT COMMANDER IS DEADLIEST.  

28:07.285 --> 28:08.852
 - WHAT IS ONE OF ROOSEVELT'S   

28:08.920 --> 28:10.554
FAVORITE BATTLEFIELD STRATEGIES 
         AND TACTICS?           

28:10.622 --> 28:11.689
          - A CHARGE.           

28:11.756 --> 28:13.524
     I LIKE TO THINK OF IT      
        AS TO SUPPRESS          

28:13.591 --> 28:14.591
AND SLAUGHTER HIS ENEMY.        

28:14.659 --> 28:16.060
- SUPPRESS AND SLAUGHTER.       

28:16.127 --> 28:17.461
GIVE ME A PERFECT EXAMPLE       
        OF THAT.                

28:17.529 --> 28:18.696
  - BATTLE OF SAN JUAN HILL.    

28:18.763 --> 28:19.663
    - WE'RE GONNA USE           
        THE TOUCH TABLE         

28:19.731 --> 28:22.066
    AND GO THERE NOW.           

28:22.133 --> 28:24.201
     - THERE IT IS, CUBA.       
         OUR BACKYARD.          

28:24.269 --> 28:26.103
    WE HAVE SAN JUAN HILL.      

28:26.171 --> 28:28.172
        WE HAVE SPANISH         
     IN TRENCH POSITIONS,       

28:28.239 --> 28:29.540
     WAITING FOR AN ENEMY       
        TO ATTACK THEM.         

28:29.607 --> 28:31.408
ROOSEVELT AND THE ROUGH RIDERS, 

28:31.476 --> 28:32.409
    THEY'RE IN A RIVERBED.      

28:32.477 --> 28:33.777
THEY'RE TAKING ARTILLERY FIRE.  

28:33.845 --> 28:35.546
        THEY'RE TAKING          
    SMALL ARMS FIRE.            

28:35.613 --> 28:37.014
- HE'S IN TROUBLE, RIGHT?       

28:37.082 --> 28:39.516
  THEY JUST START DELIVERING    
EFFECTIVE FIRE ON TOP OF THEM.  

28:39.584 --> 28:42.119
  - YES, ROOSEVELT IS LOOKING   
 AT THIS GOING, "WE'RE DYING.   

28:42.187 --> 28:43.587
    WE'RE LOSING MEN            
AND WE'RE DOING NOTHING."       

28:43.655 --> 28:46.156
SO THIS GATLING GUN DETACHMENT, 
      THEY BEGIN FIRING.        

28:46.224 --> 28:48.525
    - THE GATLING GUN           
         COMING ONLINE          

28:48.593 --> 28:51.228
    STARTS DELIVERING           
    SUPPRESSIVE FIRE.           

28:51.296 --> 28:52.963
    - ROOSEVELT HEARS           
    THIS DISTINCTIVE FIRE,      

28:53.031 --> 28:55.532
      LOOKS UP THE HILL,        
 SEES THESE SPANIARDS STARTING  

28:55.600 --> 28:57.167
          TO GO DOWN.           

28:57.235 --> 28:59.269
    THE MEN RAISE A CHEER,      
AND WITH HIM AT THE LEAD,       

28:59.337 --> 29:01.171
THEY COME OUT OF THEIR POSITION 
          AND CHARGE.           

29:01.239 --> 29:03.307
  IT TAKES THEM EIGHT MINUTES   
    TO REACH THE TOP.           

29:03.374 --> 29:06.076
    IN THAT EIGHT MINUTES,      
  THE GATLING GUN DETACHMENT    

29:06.144 --> 29:07.911
     FIRES 18,000 ROUNDS.       

29:07.979 --> 29:10.047
- WOW. THEY'RE ATTACKING        
        FROM THE FRONT.         

29:10.115 --> 29:11.281
    THEY'RE ATTACKING           
        FROM THE SIDE,          

29:11.349 --> 29:12.783
ALMOST IN A FLANKING MANEUVER.  

29:12.851 --> 29:14.384
    AND THEY CAPTURE            
        SAN JUAN HILL.          

29:14.452 --> 29:18.055
 AND THIS ALL LEADS TO WINNING  
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.       

29:18.123 --> 29:19.490
          - OH, YES--           
    SPAIN NEVER CAME BACK,      

29:19.557 --> 29:21.158
        DID THEY?

29:22.127 --> 29:23.794
      INTO THE TRENCHES,        

29:23.862 --> 29:26.063
    THE WARRIORS UNSHEATHED     
  THEIR CLOSE-COMBAT BLADES.    

29:26.131 --> 29:28.298
    THE ROUGH RIDERS' KNIFE     
          OF CHOICE:            

29:28.366 --> 29:29.833
    THE BOWIE HUNTER.           

29:29.901 --> 29:31.702
 ITS CLIP POINT DESIGN ALLOWS   

29:31.770 --> 29:33.637
        A FASTER,               
        DEEPER THRUST.          

29:33.705 --> 29:36.373
         - IT'S TOUGH,          
AND IT CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS.  

29:36.441 --> 29:38.809
- YOU CAN FIX YOUR HORSE,       
     OPEN A CAN OF BEANS.       

29:38.877 --> 29:40.911
     BUT IT WAS ALSO USED       
    AND REALLY WELL ADAPTED     

29:40.979 --> 29:42.045
         FOR HUNTING.           

29:42.113 --> 29:44.114
          CLIP POINT,           
         BLOOD GROOVE.          

29:44.182 --> 29:46.150
THIS SAME CONCEPT IS USED       
  BY THE MARINE CORPS TODAY.    

29:46.217 --> 29:48.218
  - WELL, I THINK YOURS LOOKS   
         VERY HELPFUL           

29:48.286 --> 29:49.553
      ON A CAMPING TRIP.        

29:49.621 --> 29:50.654
      BUT IF I WAS GOING        
         INTO BATTLE,           

29:50.722 --> 29:51.889
I'D PREFER TO HAVE THIS.        

29:51.956 --> 29:52.990
        narrator:               
     LAWRENCE OF ARABIA'S       

29:53.057 --> 29:54.525
    PREFERRED BLADE WEAPON:     

29:54.592 --> 29:56.927
      THE JAMBIYA DAGGER,       

29:56.995 --> 30:01.298
     THE TRADITIONAL KNIFE      
    OF NOMADIC ARAB TRIBES.     

30:01.366 --> 30:04.067
     - THE SCABBARD'S GOT       
A MUCH LARGER CURVE TO IT       

30:04.135 --> 30:05.235
    THAN THE ACTUAL DAGGER.     

30:05.303 --> 30:06.937
      THE REASON FOR THIS       

30:07.005 --> 30:08.906
     IS THEY'D BE CARRIED       
    AND HOOKED ONTO A BELT      

30:08.973 --> 30:10.007
    IN THEIR CLOTHING           

30:10.074 --> 30:11.742
    SO THAT WHEN THE DAGGER     
          WAS DRAWN,            

30:11.810 --> 30:13.010
         THE SCABBARD           
    WOULD STAY HOOKED           

30:13.077 --> 30:15.012
DOWN UNDERNEATH THE BELT.       

30:15.079 --> 30:17.314
     - LAWRENCE, YOU KNOW,      
HE ADOPTED THE CLOTHING,        

30:17.382 --> 30:18.482
    HE ADOPTED THE JAMBIYA.     

30:18.550 --> 30:19.616
         AND IN FACT,           
     JUST HOW PROUD HE WAS      

30:19.684 --> 30:21.151
IS INDICATED BY THE FACT        

30:21.219 --> 30:23.253
    THAT IN THE LAST IMAGE      
        WE HAVE OF HIM,         

30:23.321 --> 30:25.389
    THE MARBLE EFFIGY           
      ON HIS SARCOPHAGUS,       

30:25.456 --> 30:27.424
     THERE IS HIS JAMBIYA       
          IN HIS BELT.          

30:27.492 --> 30:29.660
        narrator:               
    BECAUSE TRENCH WARFARE      

30:29.727 --> 30:30.694
      WAS CONFINED CHAOS,       

30:30.762 --> 30:31.662
  GEOFF WILL TEST THE DAMAGE    

30:31.729 --> 30:33.363
AND CLOSE-QUARTER EFFECTIVENESS 

30:33.431 --> 30:35.465
         OF EACH BLADE          
      AS ENEMIES CLOSE IN       

30:35.533 --> 30:36.800
    FROM BOTH SIDES.            

30:36.868 --> 30:39.036
  - RIGHT OVER THERE WILL BE    
    A PIG COMING DOWN           

30:39.103 --> 30:40.137
    ON THIS ZIPLINE.            

30:40.205 --> 30:41.405
         TAKE HIM OUT.          

30:41.472 --> 30:43.373
 BUT YOU'LL ALSO HAVE TO REACT  

30:43.441 --> 30:44.975
     TO YOUR SECOND TARGET      
      COMING TOWARDS YOU        

30:45.043 --> 30:46.710
        AT 180 DEGREES.         

30:46.778 --> 30:48.212
         TAKE HIM OUT.          

30:48.279 --> 30:49.413
QUAY, YOU'LL BE UP FIRST        

30:49.480 --> 30:51.481
    WITH ROOSEVELT'S            
         BOWIE HUNTER.          

30:51.549 --> 30:52.783
        narrator:               
A 3-D ORIENTATION SENSOR        

30:52.851 --> 30:55.219
    WILL MEASURE THE IMPACT     
    VELOCITY OF EACH BLADE      

30:55.286 --> 30:56.920
         TO DETERMINE           
      WHICH ONE DELIVERS        

30:56.988 --> 30:58.388
      THE QUICKEST KILL.        

30:58.456 --> 31:01.525
     - ON THREE, TWO, ONE!      

31:01.593 --> 31:05.028
    RELEASE THE PIG!            

31:05.096 --> 31:06.496
             NICE.              

31:06.564 --> 31:09.333
          YEAH! YEAH!           
             NICE!              

31:09.400 --> 31:12.569
         - EXCELLENT.           
    ALL RIGHT, QUAY.            

31:12.637 --> 31:13.904
         - THIS IS NOT          
    AN INSTANT KILL.            

31:13.972 --> 31:15.672
         IT'S NOT EVEN          
        A MORTAL WOUND.         

31:15.740 --> 31:17.174
    IT'S GONNA HURT,            
MAY MAKE HIS ARM USELESS,       

31:17.242 --> 31:18.942
 BUT HE'S STILL GONNA BE ABLE   
        TO FIGHT.               

31:19.010 --> 31:21.545
      TARGET NUMBER TWO,        
 A BEAUTIFULLY DELIVERED BLOW.  

31:21.613 --> 31:23.480
    THIS ONE IS DEEP ENOUGH     
TO CAUSE AN INSTANT KILL.       

31:23.548 --> 31:25.716
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE       
         YOU WANNA GO.          

31:25.783 --> 31:26.884
     - THE BLADE IS HEAVY.      

31:26.951 --> 31:28.318
    IT'S MADE FOR STABBING.     

31:28.386 --> 31:29.786
    IT GOES RIGHT IN.           

31:29.854 --> 31:30.988
        narrator:               
    ONE MORTAL WOUND.           

31:31.055 --> 31:32.322
    ONE INSTANT KILL.           

31:32.390 --> 31:36.126
    IMPACT VELOCITY,            
      42 MILES PER HOUR.        

31:36.194 --> 31:39.863
  UP NEXT, LAWRENCE'S DEADLY    
        JAMBIYA DAGGER.         

31:39.931 --> 31:42.900
      - RELEASE THE PIG!        

31:42.967 --> 31:45.068
  - THERE YOU GO, EXCELLENT.    

31:45.136 --> 31:48.839
        - OHHHH, OHHHH!         

31:48.907 --> 31:50.407
          OH, HO, HO!           

31:50.475 --> 31:51.608
            - NICE.             

31:51.676 --> 31:53.710
 - THIS IS A HUGE LACERATION.   

31:53.778 --> 31:55.913
 THIS IS GONNA LOVE TO BLEED.   

31:55.980 --> 31:57.214
      IT'S NOT GONNA KILL       
          BY ITSELF,            

31:57.282 --> 31:58.682
    BUT WHEN YOU GET            
INTO THE STABS HIGHER UP,       

31:58.750 --> 32:01.184
        YOU DID ANOTHER         
    LACERATION HERE.            

32:01.252 --> 32:03.186
    THIS ONE IS CLOSE           
    TO THREE INCHES,            

32:03.254 --> 32:05.188
        WHICH IS GREAT          
BECAUSE YOU'RE LACERATING       

32:05.256 --> 32:06.523
          THROUGH ALL           
    OF THOSE VESSELS THERE.     

32:06.591 --> 32:08.091
    THIS IS AN INSTANT KILL     
          BY ITSELF.            

32:08.159 --> 32:09.559
        narrator:               
      THE JAMBIYA SCORES        

32:09.627 --> 32:10.994
      TWO INSTANT KILLS.        

32:11.062 --> 32:13.163
THE BLADE'S CURVED DESIGN       
        HELPS INCREASE          

32:13.231 --> 32:16.500
RICHARD'S IMPACT VELOCITY       
     TO 51 MILES PER HOUR,      

32:16.567 --> 32:18.902
          20% FASTER            
    THAN THE BOWIE HUNTER.      

32:18.970 --> 32:20.070
         - IN THE END,          

32:20.138 --> 32:21.104
     YOU HAD TO STRIKE OUT      
        A LOT OF TIMES.         

32:21.172 --> 32:22.639
        YOU GET IT ONCE         
         AND IT KILLS,          

32:22.707 --> 32:23.840
     THAT'S ALL YOU NEED.       

32:23.908 --> 32:25.242
      YOU HAVE TO STAB IT       
         50, 60 TIMES,          

32:25.310 --> 32:27.077
     LOT OF WASTED ENERGY.      

32:27.145 --> 32:28.645
        narrator:               
ROOSEVELT'S BOWIE HUNTER        

32:28.713 --> 32:31.181
         PROVES TO BE           
  A DEADLY, EFFICIENT KILLER.   

32:31.249 --> 32:33.483
     BUT THE CURVED BLADE       
 OF LAWRENCE'S JAMBIYA DAGGER   

32:33.551 --> 32:36.520
     DELIVERS SWIFT DEATH       
WITH BOTH THRUSTS AND SLASHES.  

32:36.587 --> 32:39.656
        SO WHICH BLADE          
  GIVES ITS WARRIOR THE EDGE?   

32:39.724 --> 32:41.558
- I THINK WHEN YOU'RE ENTERING  
          THAT TRENCH           

32:41.626 --> 32:44.561
    AND YOU WANT TO DELIVER     
    THAT LETHAL BLOW,           

32:44.629 --> 32:47.097
        WHICH ONE SENDS         
 A MORE INTIMIDATING MESSAGE?   

32:47.165 --> 32:49.166
  - SO I GUESS IN THIS CASE,    
    SIZE DOES MATTER?           

32:49.233 --> 32:50.834
     - SIZE IS DEFINITELY       
         INTIMIDATING.          

32:50.902 --> 32:52.569
        narrator:               
FOR CLOSE-RANGE WEAPONS,        

32:52.637 --> 32:54.371
EDGE: LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.       

32:54.439 --> 32:57.507
  BECAUSE BATTLEFIELD TACTICS   
ARE AN ESSENTIAL X FACTOR       

32:57.575 --> 32:59.276
FOR THE DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE,  

32:59.344 --> 33:02.412
MACK ANALYZES LAWRENCE'S        
  GUERRILLA WARFARE METHODS.    

33:02.480 --> 33:04.481
  - WHAT IS ONE OF LAWRENCE'S   
     FAVORITE BATTLEFIELD       

33:04.549 --> 33:05.916
     STRATEGY AND TACTICS?      

33:05.984 --> 33:08.618
  - TO HIT HARD AND TO VANISH   
    INTO THE DESERT.            

33:08.686 --> 33:10.253
         HE CALLED IT           
        A PHANTOM ARMY.         

33:10.321 --> 33:12.022
  PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THE WAY    
         THAT HE TOOK           

33:12.090 --> 33:13.890
    THE PORT OF AQABA HERE.     

33:13.958 --> 33:15.359
         - ALL RIGHT,           
        LET'S GO THERE.         

33:15.426 --> 33:17.894
- THE OBVIOUS THING TO DO       
IS TO HEAD STRAIGHT FOR AQABA.  

33:17.962 --> 33:19.096
    IT'S TOO OBVIOUS.           
        [laughs]                

33:19.163 --> 33:20.430
    BECAUSE THE TURKS           
    ARE TOO POWERFUL.           

33:20.498 --> 33:21.965
    - SO HE WOULD BE            
      CERTAINLY DESTROYED       

33:22.033 --> 33:23.633
    IF HE TRIED TO DO           
    A DIRECT ASSAULT.           

33:23.701 --> 33:26.136
         - ABSOLUTELY.          
    SO HE HAS TO FOOL THEM.     

33:26.204 --> 33:28.839
 HE WANTS THE TURKS TO BELIEVE  
      HE'S ACTUALLY GOING       

33:28.906 --> 33:30.340
         TO DAMASCUS,           
     WAY UP IN THE NORTH.       

33:30.408 --> 33:31.808
    - ALL RIGHT, DAMASCUS,      
         HERE WE COME.          

33:31.876 --> 33:33.276
     - NORTH TO DAMASCUS.       

33:33.344 --> 33:34.644
SEE THIS EXPLOSION THERE?       

33:34.712 --> 33:36.713
 THE TURKS WOULD SEND A TRAIN.  
    HE'D BLOW IT UP.            

33:36.781 --> 33:38.582
THAT CONVINCED THE TURKS        
      THAT HIS OBJECTIVE        

33:38.649 --> 33:40.150
         WAS DAMASCUS.          

33:40.218 --> 33:42.652
    - SO THEY RACE UP HERE.     
      WHAT'S LAWRENCE DO?       

33:42.720 --> 33:44.788
         - [laughing]           
      HE RACES DOWN HERE.       

33:44.856 --> 33:46.456
     - THIS IS A COMPLETE       
DIVERSIONARY TACTIC, ISN'T IT?  

33:46.524 --> 33:47.758
            - YES.              

33:47.825 --> 33:48.959
        narrator:               
  AS LAWRENCE'S PHANTOM ARMY    

33:49.027 --> 33:50.193
        TACTIC UNFOLDS,         

33:50.261 --> 33:52.529
    THE BULK OF TURK FORCES     
    RACE TO DAMASCUS,           

33:52.597 --> 33:54.698
    LEAVING ONLY ONE            
    TURKISH BATTALION           

33:54.766 --> 33:56.233
    TO DEFEND AQABA.            

33:56.300 --> 33:57.934
      - NOW IT'S GONNA BE       
    A PITCHED BATTLE.           

33:58.002 --> 34:00.270
 THE ARABS DIDN'T REALLY WANT   
      TO ATTACK THE TURKS       

34:00.338 --> 34:01.838
     BECAUSE THE TURKS HAD      
         MACHINE GUNS.          

34:01.906 --> 34:03.106
SO WHAT DOES LAWRENCE DO?       

34:03.174 --> 34:04.341
    HE GOES UP TO THE HILL,     

34:04.409 --> 34:05.442
    AND HE BURIES HIS HEAD      
         IN HIS HANDS.          

34:05.510 --> 34:07.544
AND THAT INFURIATES THEM.       

34:07.612 --> 34:08.578
      THEY ARE HUMILIATED       
        BY THIS.                

34:08.646 --> 34:10.380
- LAWRENCE ACTUALLY FIGURES OUT 

34:10.447 --> 34:12.181
 "I'M GONNA USE PSYCHOLOGICAL   
WARFARE ON MY OWN GUYS."        

34:12.250 --> 34:13.483
        - EXACTLY, YES.         

34:13.551 --> 34:16.053
- "I'M GONNA CALL THEIR MANHOODS
        INTO QUESTION."         

34:16.120 --> 34:17.687
            - YES.              

34:17.755 --> 34:19.790
 - AND THEY LITERALLY WIPE OUT  
        THIS BATTALION.         

34:19.857 --> 34:20.891
          - TOTALLY.            

34:20.958 --> 34:22.458
300 DEAD, 200 PRISONERS.        

34:22.527 --> 34:25.529
- AND LAWRENCE HAS PROVEN       
HIS PHANTOM STRATEGY AND TACTICS

34:25.596 --> 34:27.330
WORK ON THE BATTLEFIELD.        

34:27.398 --> 34:29.099
        THEY TOOK AQABA         
          AND CHANGED           

34:29.167 --> 34:30.734
    THE WHOLE OUTCOME           
        OF WORLD WAR I.         

34:30.802 --> 34:32.469
     - CHANGED THE HISTORY      
      OF THE MIDDLE EAST.       

34:32.536 --> 34:33.969
- ROOSEVELT WAS FORTUNATE       

34:34.038 --> 34:36.873
          TO COME OUT           
    OF SAN JUAN HILL ALIVE.     

34:36.940 --> 34:38.375
  HIS SUPPRESS AND SLAUGHTER    
        WORKED FOR HIM          

34:38.443 --> 34:40.577
         ON THAT DAY.           

34:40.645 --> 34:43.013
    BUT WHEN YOU LOOK           
  AT T.E. LAWRENCE'S ABILITY    

34:43.081 --> 34:45.114
     TO ADAPT, IMPROVISE,       
         AND OVERCOME           

34:45.183 --> 34:46.483
      ON THE BATTLEFIELD,       

34:46.551 --> 34:49.786
     HIS USE OF DECEPTION       
IN THE DESERTS OF ARABIA,       

34:49.853 --> 34:52.289
      T.E. LAWRENCE GETS        
        THE EDGE.

    WHO IS DEADLIEST?           

35:15.780 --> 35:18.415
    OUR TEAM OF SPECIALISTS     
    HAS TESTED AND ANALYZED     

35:18.483 --> 35:21.785
     THE WEAPONS THESE TWO      
BATTLEFIELD ICONS BROUGHT       

35:21.853 --> 35:23.487
    TO THIS SHOWDOWN.           

35:23.554 --> 35:26.723
    FOR LONG-RANGE WEAPONS,     
LAWRENCE'S VICKERS MACHINE GUN  

35:26.791 --> 35:29.860
         CAME UP SHORT          
AGAINST ROOSEVELT'S GATLING GUN.

35:29.927 --> 35:33.163
IN MEDIUM-RANGE WEAPONS,        
    A DEAD-EVEN DRAW            

35:33.231 --> 35:35.232
      BETWEEN ROOSEVELT'S       
  MORE ACCURATE KRAG CARBINE    

35:35.299 --> 35:38.301
 AND LAWRENCE'S MORE POWERFUL   
        S.M.L.E. RIFLE.         

35:38.369 --> 35:40.337
    IN CLOSE-RANGE WEAPONS,     

35:40.404 --> 35:42.572
ROOSEVELT'S BOWIE HUNTER        
    WAS SLICED APART            

35:42.640 --> 35:45.575
  BY LAWRENCE'S CURVED-BLADE    
        JAMBIYA DAGGER.         

35:45.643 --> 35:47.611
FOR BATTLEFIELD TACTICS,        

35:47.678 --> 35:49.646
     ROOSEVELT'S SUPPRESS       
    AND SLAUGHTER STRATEGY      

35:49.714 --> 35:53.350
        WAS OUTFLANKED          
  BY LAWRENCE'S PHANTOM ARMY.   

35:53.417 --> 35:56.620
    ROBERT DALY HAS ENTERED     
THE CRUCIAL WEAPONS DATA        

35:56.687 --> 35:58.388
INTO THE DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE. 

35:58.456 --> 36:00.857

        AND HISTORIANS          

36:00.925 --> 36:02.859
      HAS ALSO COMPLETED        
     THEIR VITAL RESEARCH       

36:02.927 --> 36:06.296
  AND ASSIGNED NUMERIC VALUES   
  TO MORE THAN 100 X FACTORS.   

36:06.364 --> 36:07.564
    - THERE'S ALL OF THESE      
          INTANGIBLES           

36:07.632 --> 36:09.266
THAT REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 

36:09.333 --> 36:10.634
        WHEN YOU GO OUT         
     ON THE BATTLEFIELD--       

36:10.701 --> 36:12.102
      WHAT THEIR DIET IS,       

36:12.170 --> 36:13.670
WHAT THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS.       

36:13.738 --> 36:15.305
        OUR HISTORIANS          
      AND OUR RESEARCHERS       

36:15.373 --> 36:16.473
GO THROUGH ALL THIS DATA        

36:16.541 --> 36:19.075
      AND RATE EVERYTHING       
        FROM 1 TO 100,          

36:19.143 --> 36:20.911
        100 BEING               
     THE PERFECT WARRIOR.       

36:20.978 --> 36:23.213
    - HOW DO YOU FACTOR IN      
        CALM UNDER FIRE         

36:23.281 --> 36:24.314
        INSIDE THE SIM?         

36:24.382 --> 36:25.849
    - CALM UNDER FIRE           

36:25.917 --> 36:27.184
DOES SWING TOWARDS TEDDY        
            IN THIS             

36:27.251 --> 36:29.419
     BECAUSE TEDDY REALLY       
    DID HAVE TO GO IN THERE     

36:29.487 --> 36:31.288
        AND MIX IT UP.          

36:31.355 --> 36:33.023
            I MEAN,             
    HE'S SHOOTING SPANIARDS     

36:33.090 --> 36:35.192
        AT 15, 20 FEET.         

36:35.259 --> 36:36.526
CALM UNDER FIRE FOR TEDDY       
        IS AN 86,               

36:36.594 --> 36:37.761
     VERSUS LAWRENCE'S 81.      

36:37.828 --> 36:39.162
     - MAKES SENSE TO ME.       
    - IT REALLY DOES.           

36:39.230 --> 36:42.332
    - WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT      
 NOT ONLY PHYSICAL ENDURANCE,   

36:42.400 --> 36:45.302
     BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL      
ENDURANCE THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE 

36:45.369 --> 36:46.469
  TO WITHSTAND THE ELEMENTS,    

36:46.537 --> 36:48.371
TO WITHSTAND THE DESERT,        

36:48.439 --> 36:50.040
         TO WITHSTAND           
    THE JUNGLE ENVIRONMENT.     

36:50.107 --> 36:51.841
    - IT REALLY COMES DOWN      

36:51.909 --> 36:54.177
         TO LAWRENCE'S          
     SUB-FIVE-MINUTE MILE.      

36:54.245 --> 36:55.545
AND LOOK AT THE HARDSHIPS       
THAT HE'S GOING THROUGH.        

36:55.613 --> 36:58.782
        FOR ENDURANCE,          
    WE RATED TEDDY AT A 71      

36:58.849 --> 37:00.217
    BUT LAWRENCE AT AN 88.      

37:00.284 --> 37:02.085
         - OKAY, GUYS,          
THE X FACTORS WERE CLOSE

         IN THIS ONE.

        GOING FOR HIM.

HE HAD NEWER TECHNOLOGY.        

40:47.945 --> 40:50.780

 DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN BETTER.

          HAVING THAT           
  TRIED-AND-TRUE TECHNOLOGY.

WAS ABLE TO PULL IT OUT,

      BUT BEAT A WARRIOR

      GREATEST ATTRIBUTES       

41:10.868 --> 41:12.435
        WAS HIS ABILITY

      TO GET THINGS DONE        

41:20.077 --> 41:22.479

  UNTIL HE ACCOMPLISHED THEM.
