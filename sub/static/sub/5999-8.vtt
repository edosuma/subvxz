WEBVTT

00:00.148 --> 00:01.647
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:01.649 --> 00:05.384
Information is the future,
and Britain needs a future.

00:05.386 --> 00:07.586
You want me to steal for you?

00:07.621 --> 00:09.130
For king and country.

00:09.131 --> 00:12.357
Lucy got him back, my grandson.

00:12.359 --> 00:16.210
So help me, Paul, you'll
go home to your little boy.

00:21.018 --> 00:25.338
Paul Crosley, he and Constance
Faraday are involved in something.

00:28.358 --> 00:31.628
Mom's in St. Louis, Dad's in Jefferson City

00:31.629 --> 00:34.130
at the state penitentiary.

00:34.131 --> 00:36.682
Why am I tell you that?
My wife doesn't even know.

00:37.384 --> 00:38.717
Enlistment papers?

00:39.269 --> 00:40.469
You'll stay right here

00:41.154 --> 00:43.472
as a private in the Army under my command.

00:43.473 --> 00:45.023
Why keep me on the Hill?

00:45.025 --> 00:47.742
They can build this bomb
without... without statesmen,

00:47.778 --> 00:50.829
without generals, but they
can't build it without us.

00:50.864 --> 00:53.915
Any ignorance from here on out

00:53.951 --> 00:57.369
is willful and won't be forgiven.

00:59.756 --> 01:02.040
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

01:02.092 --> 01:05.877
The doctor says I still got three or
four micrograms swimming around in my gut.

01:05.879 --> 01:09.097
How do you tell your wife that you
could have a kid with three heads?

01:09.132 --> 01:12.717
You guys love each other.
You'll figure it out.

01:12.919 --> 01:14.886
Are you a spy, Jim?

01:14.921 --> 01:16.588
Are you the one the
colonel's been looking for?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.306
Stay... stay away from me.

01:18.341 --> 01:20.091
Jeannie... Jeannie.

01:21.428 --> 01:23.445
They're starting.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.165
I'll handle this.

Maybe it's a post office box?

02:32.191 --> 02:33.941
But let's keep that between friends.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.551
Listen,

02:35.552 --> 02:37.852
I know they got a whole army in there.

02:37.888 --> 02:40.271
A whole army in a post office box?

02:40.307 --> 02:42.640
A bunch of scientists working on something.

02:42.642 --> 02:44.809
I know it and you know it.

02:46.646 --> 02:48.646
Maybe you should fold
yourself into a letter,

02:48.648 --> 02:50.448
see where the trail leads you.

02:50.484 --> 02:52.817
- I'll lick the stamp.
- Ah, okay.

02:52.869 --> 02:54.452
So you are the cavalry.

02:54.488 --> 02:55.787
I am in the right place.

02:55.822 --> 02:57.455
Listen, pal, I'm...

02:57.491 --> 02:59.324
I'm just a guy looking
for someone I care about.

02:59.376 --> 03:02.827
Okay, now it's my turn at bat.

03:02.879 --> 03:05.463
You. Who are you?

03:05.499 --> 03:07.499
Isaacs.

03:07.501 --> 03:09.384
Ring a bell?

03:10.670 --> 03:12.220
Triple-checked the circuits?

03:12.255 --> 03:14.055
Twice.

03:14.091 --> 03:16.674
Subcircuits?

03:16.676 --> 03:19.844
Zero minus one minute.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.515
Hey, they make a final sweep?

03:23.567 --> 03:25.316
All areas clear, sir.

03:25.352 --> 03:27.235
Everyone's outside the final perimeter.

03:29.573 --> 03:31.156
Just a little more.

03:31.191 --> 03:32.824
About 15 degrees over to the right.

03:32.859 --> 03:34.859
Pull those wires back a bit.

03:34.861 --> 03:37.362
Zero minus 45 seconds.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.870
It's happening, Louis.

03:47.407 --> 03:49.074
Uh, if it's all the same,

03:49.109 --> 03:52.777
I... I think I'm just gonna skip the show.

04:07.611 --> 04:11.613
All personnel prepare for detonation.

04:11.648 --> 04:14.699
Do we really need Army brass at a pretest?

04:14.734 --> 04:16.284
Well, eight weeks from now,

04:16.319 --> 04:17.902
you'll have half the President's Cabinet

04:17.904 --> 04:19.737
and the Joint Chiefs
breathing down your neck.

04:19.738 --> 04:20.904
Might as well get used to it.

04:20.957 --> 04:22.957
nine,

04:22.993 --> 04:24.793
eight,

04:24.828 --> 04:26.377
seven,

04:26.413 --> 04:28.379
six,

04:28.415 --> 04:29.914
- five...
- You gotta keep it rolling.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.082
Four,

04:31.084 --> 04:32.467
three,

04:32.502 --> 04:34.219
two,

04:34.254 --> 04:36.137
one.

04:36.173 --> 04:38.006
Fire!

04:40.477 --> 04:41.926
Oh, what the... ?

04:49.319 --> 04:52.153
What just happened?

04:56.042 --> 04:57.675
Did you see that?

05:06.953 --> 05:08.453
Jesus.

05:59.389 --> 06:01.339
Uh, no.

06:01.341 --> 06:04.726
No, Private? Count the stripes.

06:04.761 --> 06:07.228
Yeah, your stripes can march
me into a machine-gun nest

06:07.264 --> 06:08.730
or off a cliff.

06:08.765 --> 06:10.148
But they can't make me fix

06:10.183 --> 06:12.016
Charlie Isaacs' broken bomb.

06:12.068 --> 06:14.852
You think I'm bluffing?

06:14.854 --> 06:17.238
It's this moment right here,

06:17.274 --> 06:20.191
this is why you kept me on the Hill.

06:20.193 --> 06:22.527
I'm your what, your
manufacturer's warranty?

06:22.529 --> 06:24.195
I can send you off the Hill right now.

06:24.197 --> 06:26.030
Next boat across the Pacific.

06:26.082 --> 06:28.032
You got a confused boy

06:28.034 --> 06:29.500
staring into the guts of a monster

06:29.536 --> 06:31.920
he will never fully understand.

06:31.955 --> 06:33.871
Maybe...

06:33.924 --> 06:36.591
Maybe God will hand him some
kind of miracle, a eureka.

06:36.626 --> 06:38.176
Put your faith in that,

06:38.211 --> 06:39.761
put me on any boat you like.

06:39.796 --> 06:41.963
Whatever floats yours.

06:42.966 --> 06:44.882
So what do you want?

06:47.437 --> 06:49.554
My old wardrobe.

06:49.606 --> 06:52.056
An honorable discharge,

06:52.108 --> 06:53.524
which means you can't threaten
to ship me off to Japan

06:53.560 --> 06:55.610
every time you get the yen.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.279
And get to see my wife whenever I like.

06:58.315 --> 07:00.148
You think she wants to see you?

07:02.118 --> 07:04.702
That's my concern, not yours.

07:04.738 --> 07:06.371
Fine.

07:06.406 --> 07:09.240
If you can clean up Isaacs' mess,

07:09.292 --> 07:12.377
- I'll sign the papers.
- Oh, and one more thing.

07:12.412 --> 07:15.129
I want a seat on the Target Committee.

07:15.165 --> 07:16.748
Scientists, we built this bomb.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.082
We want some say in how

07:18.134 --> 07:19.250
and where it is used.

07:19.302 --> 07:21.252
That I can't give you.

07:21.254 --> 07:23.254
Today's detonation was
supposed to be the dry run.

07:23.256 --> 07:24.922
My guess is every day

07:24.924 --> 07:27.058
Isaacs can't figure out what went wrong,

07:27.093 --> 07:30.395
you lose a week or more
on your test schedule.

07:30.430 --> 07:32.313
Probably already blew July Fourth.

07:32.349 --> 07:35.316
Pretty soon you'll be looking into August.

07:35.352 --> 07:37.318
Or I could catch that cruise you offered,

07:37.354 --> 07:39.937
maybe there will be no test at all.

07:41.274 --> 07:43.274
Dr. Winter?

07:45.111 --> 07:47.996
I can get the scientists a
seat on the Target Committee.

07:48.031 --> 07:50.448
But it won't be you.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.587
Thanks, Jim.

07:56.623 --> 07:58.956
You shouldn't have.

08:04.547 --> 08:06.514
So it, um...

08:08.518 --> 08:09.967
just went up in smoke, huh?

08:09.969 --> 08:11.636
Yeah.

08:11.638 --> 08:14.639
Yeah, it was like a marshmallow on a stick.

08:14.691 --> 08:16.307
Charlie's sending a bunch
of us back to the Hill

08:16.309 --> 08:17.809
to recheck our work.

08:18.845 --> 08:21.529
Right. Um...

08:28.154 --> 08:30.488
I've been...

08:30.540 --> 08:32.490
trying to write this letter

08:32.491 --> 08:33.875
to her sister.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.994
Only...

08:37.047 --> 08:39.212
what do you say to someone you never met?

08:42.719 --> 08:46.070
"Sorry you couldn't come to her wedding"?

08:48.441 --> 08:52.060
"Sorry she wandered off into
a construction site and"...

08:52.095 --> 08:54.345
Fritz.

08:59.269 --> 09:01.936
I'm sure everybody just
thinks it's my fault.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.224
It was an accident.

09:07.594 --> 09:09.660
I should have walked her home, Jim.

09:09.696 --> 09:10.895
She said she was feeling off

09:10.930 --> 09:12.530
and I just let her go and...

09:14.768 --> 09:16.033
You know, no one in her family

09:16.069 --> 09:17.902
even knew what state she was in.

09:17.937 --> 09:19.504
The Army is probably just gonna tell them

09:19.539 --> 09:21.706
that she died a hero.

09:21.741 --> 09:23.741
She did.

09:29.215 --> 09:31.382
Jeannie was the best.

09:38.108 --> 09:40.975
You know, people always
say that kind of bull.

09:45.565 --> 09:47.899
But she really was, wasn't she?

10:08.171 --> 10:09.804
Heard you're having some trouble.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.390
You don't wanna be here.

10:12.425 --> 10:14.225
And I told the colonel
I didn't need your help.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.726
I think he must be hard of hearing

10:15.762 --> 10:17.094
'cause I'm following a direct order

10:17.096 --> 10:19.230
from my commanding officer.

10:19.265 --> 10:21.482
So you still have no idea

10:21.518 --> 10:22.984
which part was faulty,

10:23.019 --> 10:24.769
which division can fix it.

10:24.771 --> 10:27.438
Never mind how long the redesign will take.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.657
Hell, you probably lost
another day on the schedule

10:29.692 --> 10:30.942
since we started talking.

10:30.944 --> 10:34.612
So maybe you should quit talking.

10:34.664 --> 10:36.447
Yes, sir.

10:52.048 --> 10:53.848
German radio has just announced

10:53.883 --> 10:56.684
that Adolf Hitler is dead.

10:56.719 --> 10:59.971
- What's going on?
- Hitler just blew his goddamn brains out.

11:00.023 --> 11:02.056
It's all over!

11:17.898 --> 11:19.898
Sir.

11:40.921 --> 11:42.705
- He there?
- Hold, please.

11:42.707 --> 11:45.340
Charlie, hello.

11:45.376 --> 11:46.875
You're in Santa Fe County?

11:46.877 --> 11:49.595
Well, you gotta see the
place I slept last night.

11:49.630 --> 11:52.848
Made me nostalgic for the lockup.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.683
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

11:54.719 --> 11:57.052
Hey, come on. Is that any
way to greet your father

11:57.104 --> 11:59.021
after all these years?

11:59.056 --> 12:01.056
You shouldn't have come here.
It's reckless and stupid.

12:01.058 --> 12:03.058
Probably a parole violation, too.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.610
I'm a changed man, Charlie.

12:04.645 --> 12:07.029
You were a sad old man before,

12:07.064 --> 12:09.448
you'll be a sad old man
till the day you die.

12:09.483 --> 12:11.784
Okay, look, don't say that, please.

12:11.819 --> 12:14.069
That's not the way, okay?

12:14.071 --> 12:16.739
What's he called, Charlie, hmm?

12:16.741 --> 12:18.874
My grandson,

12:18.909 --> 12:20.959
what's his name?

12:23.914 --> 12:26.165
Go to hell.

12:27.418 --> 12:29.134
Charlie?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.900
- Abby.
- Hmm?

12:44.935 --> 12:47.269
I was on a call.

12:47.271 --> 12:50.489
Is there somewhere we can talk?

12:50.524 --> 12:52.658
We are interrupting this program

12:52.693 --> 12:54.109
to bring you a news flash.

12:54.161 --> 12:55.994
German radio...

12:56.030 --> 12:58.614
Well, they've already
invented a novelty cocktail.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.500
"Hitler's Brain"...
Schnapps and red grenadine.

13:01.535 --> 13:03.502
What's all this?

13:05.005 --> 13:06.705
Shut the door.

13:10.211 --> 13:12.094
We're leaving.

13:12.129 --> 13:15.130
Thankfully for us, Europe's
down to a dull simmer

13:15.132 --> 13:16.632
and sea-lanes should be opening up.

13:16.634 --> 13:19.134
We're leaving when?

13:19.186 --> 13:21.804
Tomorrow. Arranged it with the colonel.

13:21.806 --> 13:24.022
Our war is over.

13:24.058 --> 13:27.693
- We have no quarrel with the Japs.
- What about our side project?

13:27.728 --> 13:30.946
Our contacts in Site X
and Site Z have gone quiet.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.481
Could be nothing,

13:32.483 --> 13:34.366
or it could be a rope
tightening round our necks.

13:34.401 --> 13:36.318
We shan't wait around to find out.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.821
What, so we poached a king's
ransom worth in nuclear secrets

13:38.823 --> 13:40.956
to leave it all behind in the dust?

13:40.991 --> 13:44.660
Nothing's being left behind in the dust.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.128
We're carrying the papers with us.

13:46.163 --> 13:48.497
In our luggage? Are you mad?

13:48.549 --> 13:50.382
We're the Allies, don't forget.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.001
They're not likely to go
fingering our knickers.

13:57.007 --> 13:59.641
Yeah, well, it's, um...

13:59.677 --> 14:02.144
Well, this is very sudden news.

14:02.179 --> 14:04.012
Pack your things, Paul.

14:04.064 --> 14:06.181
And don't get sentimental.

14:06.233 --> 14:09.067
This place was always a safari,

14:09.103 --> 14:10.903
not a home.

14:24.535 --> 14:27.035
So your old man called, huh?

14:29.540 --> 14:32.040
Not much older than you.

14:32.092 --> 14:35.043
Yeah, I don't have much
use for mine either.

14:36.463 --> 14:38.931
They all think the war's over.

14:38.966 --> 14:40.716
Can you blame them?

14:40.718 --> 14:43.268
We've been selling them the
German version since day one.

14:44.889 --> 14:46.221
Guy puts a bullet in his head,

14:46.273 --> 14:48.357
everyone acts like it's Christmas morning.

14:48.392 --> 14:49.892
More like Hanukkah.

14:52.062 --> 14:54.696
- I don't need your help, Frank.
- I never said you did.

14:54.732 --> 14:56.565
I'm gonna fix it.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.567
Well, half my experimental problems

14:58.569 --> 15:00.619
boiled down to the detonators.

15:00.654 --> 15:02.571
You did use 32 of them, right?

15:02.623 --> 15:04.706
Yeah, the detonators were the
first thing I checked, Frank.

15:04.742 --> 15:06.959
Yellow, red. I'm not color-blind.

15:17.588 --> 15:19.004
Hey.

15:45.282 --> 15:46.865
All right...

15:50.337 --> 15:52.120
say you're me.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.623
Fun game. Got a beautiful young wife.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.291
Got my whole life ahead of me.

15:56.293 --> 15:59.628
You've built the most complex
machine in human history

15:59.680 --> 16:02.431
and it might have an Achilles'
heel. How do you find it?

16:02.466 --> 16:03.966
Gee, I don't know.

16:03.968 --> 16:06.802
Maybe ask the guy who
came up with the design.

16:11.859 --> 16:14.309
I've been through
everything. It all checks out.

16:14.361 --> 16:15.944
Apparently not.

16:15.980 --> 16:17.696
What if it can't be fixed?

16:19.817 --> 16:22.117
All right, get up.

16:22.152 --> 16:25.620
Come on. All this shit's
just muddling your brain.

16:25.656 --> 16:27.372
You're not gonna find your answers

16:27.408 --> 16:28.857
sifting through the trash.

16:28.892 --> 16:30.993
Where are you going?

16:30.995 --> 16:33.078
I'm going back to square one.

16:37.718 --> 16:40.218
Someone starts bellowing
about a secret project

16:40.254 --> 16:42.971
10 miles from here, I take it seriously.

16:43.007 --> 16:45.390
I understand, but all I'm
asking for is a day pass

16:45.426 --> 16:47.175
and an hour with my father-in-law.

16:47.227 --> 16:49.478
My men have informed Mr. Isaacs

16:49.513 --> 16:51.263
that he has 24 hours to leave the county.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.685
Country, faith, family.

16:56.737 --> 16:59.771
Aren't those the things that
matter the most, Colonel?

17:01.275 --> 17:02.741
It's my understanding that Charlie

17:02.776 --> 17:04.358
wants nothing to do with this man.

17:06.446 --> 17:08.329
- Yes, that's true.
- You do know what the Bible says

17:08.365 --> 17:10.615
about honoring thy husband?

17:12.368 --> 17:15.670
It also says that people are basically good

17:15.705 --> 17:18.006
and that we all have
something to atone for.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.375
Yes, well, you can give
him a chance to atone

17:20.411 --> 17:22.144
after the war.

17:23.579 --> 17:25.781
I have family in Eastern Europe.

17:25.816 --> 17:29.184
Cousins that I never met
and some that I never will,

17:29.219 --> 17:31.586
and my son has never met his grandfather,

17:31.622 --> 17:33.522
who is sitting at a pay telephone

17:33.557 --> 17:35.190
10 miles from this office.

17:35.225 --> 17:39.094
The Jewish people don't
just need Palestine, Colonel.

17:39.129 --> 17:41.296
We need each other.

17:58.298 --> 18:00.165
What about this?

18:02.586 --> 18:06.088
What if solenoid 132B
was out of alignment...

18:06.140 --> 18:08.890
Um, an electrical arc

18:08.926 --> 18:11.259
occurs at, uh, section P22.

18:11.295 --> 18:13.762
Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.

18:13.797 --> 18:15.197
But they did.

18:20.304 --> 18:21.853
Condensers?

18:23.440 --> 18:24.656
Totally normal.

18:34.284 --> 18:36.585
Cork lining.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.454
Maybe absorbed some of
the moisture in the air,

18:39.506 --> 18:41.456
came into contact with an exposed wire.

18:41.508 --> 18:43.792
Not a lot of moisture in the desert.

18:43.844 --> 18:45.927
Hope one of those doughboys out there

18:45.963 --> 18:47.963
knows how to brew a pot of coffee.

19:02.529 --> 19:04.312
What are you doing? You shouldn't...

19:04.364 --> 19:05.697
You shouldn't be here.

19:10.204 --> 19:11.870
They were gonna have kids.

19:14.825 --> 19:16.658
They were talking about it.

19:16.710 --> 19:19.661
The girl is gone.

19:19.713 --> 19:20.996
She has a name.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.167
It didn't happen.

19:26.570 --> 19:28.503
And you'll believe that eventually.

19:30.507 --> 19:33.341
You need to believe that.

19:33.343 --> 19:35.143
Why?

19:35.179 --> 19:38.680
- Because the ends justify the means?
- Yes.

19:38.732 --> 19:41.349
So long as the ends are not dead ends,

19:41.401 --> 19:43.852
you're gonna save thousands of people.

19:43.904 --> 19:47.189
Maybe even hundreds of thousands.

19:49.193 --> 19:52.694
You are the linchpin.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.710
What about a rogue lightning strike?

20:08.712 --> 20:10.545
A what?

20:10.547 --> 20:12.931
A bolt from the blue...

20:12.966 --> 20:14.849
Happens all the time.

20:14.885 --> 20:17.435
A storm can be 50 miles away.

20:17.471 --> 20:19.888
Current travels laterally

20:19.890 --> 20:22.557
from the leading edge of the
thundercloud through clear air...

20:22.593 --> 20:24.226
I think we need a break.

20:29.399 --> 20:32.234
My father used to say lightning
always strikes eventually

20:32.236 --> 20:34.202
if you sit at a card table long enough.

20:34.238 --> 20:37.572
Only losers get up before
the weather changes.

20:37.608 --> 20:40.475
You're 29 years old.

20:40.510 --> 20:43.245
Shepherding the most
important scientific project

20:43.280 --> 20:45.280
since Louis Pasteur.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.582
What... what has your father done?

20:47.634 --> 20:48.883
I know a thing or two about

20:48.919 --> 20:50.752
trying to improve your origins,

20:50.754 --> 20:52.921
believe me, Charlie.

20:56.260 --> 20:57.559
Okay, say I'm you.

20:58.929 --> 21:02.397
Say I'm you and the war is done

21:02.432 --> 21:03.932
and the bomb didn't work.

21:03.984 --> 21:05.767
What's the worst that happens?

21:05.819 --> 21:07.602
A bomb didn't work, a
lot of innocent people

21:07.604 --> 21:09.154
didn't lose their lives.

21:09.189 --> 21:12.107
No. We have no idea how it's gonna be used.

21:12.109 --> 21:13.775
Say I'm you.

21:13.777 --> 21:17.279
I got a beautiful wife and a son.

21:17.281 --> 21:21.783
And I've got my whole life ahead of me.

21:21.835 --> 21:24.919
What is it I want on my conscience?

21:24.955 --> 21:27.789
What are they gonna say at my funeral?

21:40.387 --> 21:42.971
You're not me, Frank.

23:32.029 --> 23:33.645
What are you doing? Give that to me!

23:33.697 --> 23:35.614
- Give... give that...
- "Perseus...

23:35.649 --> 23:38.483
Perseus is immature,
distrustful of authority,

23:38.535 --> 23:40.452
politically unformed"...

23:40.487 --> 23:42.487
It's not what it looks like.

23:42.539 --> 23:44.205
A crib sheet?

23:44.241 --> 23:46.207
So you can keep me
wrapped around your finger?

23:46.243 --> 23:48.159
No.

23:48.161 --> 23:51.046
"He... he believes that he is
more intelligent than he is,

23:51.081 --> 23:53.164
which makes him susceptible to flattery."

23:53.216 --> 23:55.634
- Jim...
- This is what you really think of me?

23:55.669 --> 23:57.669
- No, it's not.
- You think that...

23:57.721 --> 24:00.839
you think I'm condescending?

24:00.841 --> 24:02.340
Those notes are not about you.

24:02.392 --> 24:04.142
Oh, well, I guess that there's

24:04.177 --> 24:05.510
another Soviet spy on the Hill.

24:10.851 --> 24:12.517
No.

24:12.519 --> 24:15.186
That's not possible.

24:15.188 --> 24:16.855
No.

24:16.907 --> 24:18.823
I came to you.

24:18.859 --> 24:21.242
I gave you everything.

24:21.278 --> 24:22.744
You said I was the linchpin.

24:22.779 --> 24:25.196
Who is it?

24:25.198 --> 24:28.366
I would tell you if I could.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.368
Compartmentalization.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.370
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:32.372 --> 24:37.008
I let you murder my best friend's wife,

24:37.044 --> 24:40.595
then I looked him in the
eye and I lied to him.

24:40.630 --> 24:41.930
You didn't have a choice.

24:41.965 --> 24:44.933
Yeah, well, I have one now.

24:44.968 --> 24:47.218
What, you're gonna call Fritz,

24:47.220 --> 24:48.386
tell him the truth?

24:48.388 --> 24:50.855
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will.

24:50.891 --> 24:53.775
So he loses his wife and his...

24:53.810 --> 24:57.062
And his best friend. That
somehow balances the equation?

24:57.064 --> 24:59.447
If you stop now, then you're a killer,

24:59.483 --> 25:01.616
- but if you see it through...
- What?

25:01.651 --> 25:03.568
I'm a hero?

25:03.570 --> 25:05.453
I'm not the one that's
susceptible to flattery.

25:05.489 --> 25:07.739
No, you're the one that wanted to know

25:07.791 --> 25:10.408
that your friend Sid's
death was worth something.

25:13.964 --> 25:15.914
The wind must have changed direction

25:15.966 --> 25:17.749
in the middle of an experiment...

25:17.801 --> 25:19.968
At least one... and dispersed the barium

25:20.003 --> 25:22.087
all the way here

25:22.139 --> 25:24.389
from Bayo Canyon.

25:24.424 --> 25:26.091
Let me ask you a question.

25:26.143 --> 25:27.592
Who cares?

25:35.485 --> 25:37.936
The work helps, Fritz.

25:39.489 --> 25:41.406
You're out here snipping shrubs

25:41.441 --> 25:44.242
and dissecting seedpods for what?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.578
Barium doesn't matter.

25:46.613 --> 25:50.115
Matter doesn't matter.

25:50.117 --> 25:52.784
The only thing that matters is people.

25:52.836 --> 25:54.953
Who loves you and who you love.

25:55.005 --> 25:57.539
And Jeannie...

26:00.210 --> 26:01.793
Boy, did she understand that.

26:05.515 --> 26:07.882
Okay, you see this prickly pear?

26:09.686 --> 26:12.604
This is just about the only sweet
thing that grows around here,

26:12.639 --> 26:15.140
so the Pueblo Indians make it into candy.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.860
Do... do you have any idea

26:18.895 --> 26:22.814
what barium does to a child's intestines?

26:22.816 --> 26:24.816
Me neither. Not yet.

26:24.868 --> 26:26.985
Jeannie was right.

26:26.987 --> 26:28.987
People matter and... and there...

26:28.989 --> 26:31.623
And there are 20,000
of them living 50 miles

26:31.658 --> 26:33.992
from where we are about to detonate

26:33.994 --> 26:35.994
an atomic weapon.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.333
You know,

26:42.385 --> 26:46.221
we could, um, clip cactus
out here all day long,

26:46.256 --> 26:49.007
but we'd still be two
steps down the food chain.

26:49.009 --> 26:50.892
I know.

26:50.927 --> 26:54.429
I had to start somewhere and...

26:56.183 --> 26:58.349
I'm not ready to spread barium on my toast

26:58.351 --> 27:01.069
- and wait to see what happens.
- Right, but I am.

27:01.104 --> 27:03.738
Let me be your subject.

27:03.773 --> 27:05.373
I mean, I've already got a few micrograms

27:05.408 --> 27:07.025
of plutonium in my body, right?

27:07.077 --> 27:10.662
So give me a few more
and measure the results.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.996
Fritz.

27:12.032 --> 27:14.749
I've got nothing left to lose.

27:14.784 --> 27:17.919
It's perfect.

27:22.042 --> 27:24.542
Order up!

27:29.549 --> 27:31.099
You got 20 minutes, pal.

27:31.134 --> 27:33.384
A free state.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.687
All 48 are free, actually.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.056
I told you I'm not getting...

27:38.108 --> 27:40.608
Mr. Isaacs?

27:42.395 --> 27:44.395
Hello.

27:47.234 --> 27:48.950
I'm Abby

27:48.985 --> 27:52.120
and this is your grandson Joey.

27:53.657 --> 27:56.457
Oh, boy, that is a lady-slayer

27:56.493 --> 27:57.876
in training right there.

27:57.911 --> 28:00.211
Dead ringer for his Uncle Mort.

28:00.247 --> 28:01.746
Just like him.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.915
You watch this one, Mom.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.252
Charlie always did have good taste.

28:07.254 --> 28:09.754
Is he in the car or something?

28:09.806 --> 28:12.590
He's actually very busy.

28:12.592 --> 28:14.809
I wanted a chance to
finally meet you myself

28:14.844 --> 28:16.811
and Joey, too, right?

28:16.846 --> 28:18.596
Hey, Joey.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.266
See that?

28:21.268 --> 28:23.735
Spud Davis knocked that
out of Sportsman's Park

28:23.770 --> 28:26.104
in '35. I want you to keep it.

28:26.156 --> 28:30.275
- What do you say? Yeah.
- Thank you.

28:30.327 --> 28:33.328
Mommy, could I go outside?

28:33.363 --> 28:35.246
Of course you can, kid.

28:35.282 --> 28:36.831
Why not, right?

28:36.866 --> 28:40.919
All right. You go on and play.

28:40.954 --> 28:42.337
Go on.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.672
But, Joey, stay away from the cars.

28:44.708 --> 28:48.009
I know a good egg when I see one.

28:48.044 --> 28:51.462
We're family, the four of us.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.798
It shouldn't have taken this long, huh?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.968
- Mr. Isaacs, I...
- Oh, please, Eli.

28:57.020 --> 28:59.938
Hell, Dad, right?

28:59.973 --> 29:01.639
Thank you.

29:01.691 --> 29:04.275
I know that you and Charlie
had a bit of a falling out,

29:04.311 --> 29:06.778
but with everything that's been
happening with our people in Europe...

29:06.813 --> 29:09.280
We all need to come together

29:09.316 --> 29:11.149
and repair old wounds,

29:11.201 --> 29:12.483
don't we?

29:13.570 --> 29:15.153
"Our people."

29:15.155 --> 29:16.871
Exactly.

29:16.906 --> 29:19.290
You know, we got the
papers a week late inside.

29:19.326 --> 29:22.160
But I always tried to read what I could.

29:22.162 --> 29:25.163
- Inside?
- Oh, Charlie never told you.

29:25.165 --> 29:28.499
Well, I'm not ashamed of it anymore.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.719
I ran numbers. Didn't run fast enough.

29:34.007 --> 29:36.057
You've paid your debt.

29:36.092 --> 29:39.477
When I was in prison,

29:39.512 --> 29:42.230
hearing the news coming out of Europe,

29:42.265 --> 29:46.401
it made me realize that
I hadn't been a good Jew.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.404
While so many were being slaughtered,

29:49.439 --> 29:53.524
I took my ancestry for granted.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.410
You understand?

29:57.964 --> 30:00.248
Why don't we give Charlie a call?

30:00.283 --> 30:02.667
I know that you and he

30:02.702 --> 30:04.085
had some words on the telephone,

30:04.120 --> 30:05.870
- but I really think...
- Oh, I don't know.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.423
He has plenty of fair grievances with me.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.792
Well, it's time for him to move past them.

30:17.801 --> 30:19.684
She said you could reach her on this number

30:19.719 --> 30:20.718
for the next few minutes.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.387
She said it was important.

30:28.895 --> 30:32.063
She has no idea what that word means.

30:32.065 --> 30:33.614
Dismissed.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.128
He wanted to come.

30:47.163 --> 30:50.248
It's just, well,

30:50.250 --> 30:53.751
Charlie's not around very much these days.

30:53.753 --> 30:55.753
I see.

30:55.755 --> 30:58.423
- Well, don't beat yourself up.
- No.

30:58.475 --> 31:00.475
I'm just glad I got to see you two.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.127
So, what kind of work
is he doing these days?

31:03.163 --> 31:05.897
Oh, I, um... I barely understand it.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.517
It's um, physics, I guess.

31:11.354 --> 31:14.238
Pillow talk ain't something
that youngsters do anymore?

31:14.274 --> 31:16.607
Abby, look,

31:16.609 --> 31:19.660
I know he's working for the Army.

31:19.696 --> 31:22.280
- Oh.
- And I got a great idea.

31:22.282 --> 31:23.948
Something where

31:23.950 --> 31:25.950
we can all be together in the end.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.952
You're here now and it's a start.

31:28.004 --> 31:31.339
Exactly. Now, the war
is winding down, okay?

31:31.374 --> 31:33.758
And you and I both know
the problem with the Jews.

31:33.793 --> 31:35.510
We've never defended ourselves.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.845
We need weapons.

31:37.881 --> 31:40.681
Now, I know it's a harsh truth, Abby,

31:40.717 --> 31:43.601
and I don't know beans about
Charlie's hush-hush project.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.470
But I'm a betting man.

31:45.472 --> 31:47.972
And I bet that it's a weapon.

31:48.024 --> 31:49.807
A big one.

31:49.859 --> 31:52.026
Now hear me out. If he'll
do something like that

31:52.061 --> 31:55.613
for a government who turned
away the Jews by the boatload,

31:55.648 --> 31:57.698
then maybe he could do
it for his own people.

31:57.734 --> 31:59.784
And we can do it together.

31:59.819 --> 32:02.487
Isaacs and Son.

32:05.492 --> 32:08.993
You want to build weapons?

32:08.995 --> 32:12.663
With Charlie's Army contacts
and my way around a deal?

32:12.715 --> 32:15.383
There will be a bonanza as
soon as this war is over,

32:15.418 --> 32:18.336
and we can help our own people.

32:18.388 --> 32:21.222
You want to make money

32:21.257 --> 32:23.641
selling arms to the Jewish people?

32:23.676 --> 32:26.561
Look, if Charlie doesn't like this idea,

32:26.596 --> 32:28.062
believe me, I got a million more

32:28.097 --> 32:30.231
bouncing around in this head, so...

32:32.352 --> 32:34.852
You know, I... I really
have to get Joey home.

32:34.854 --> 32:38.072
Do you wanna go and say goodbye to him?

32:38.107 --> 32:40.074
Of course.

32:41.528 --> 32:44.195
- Isaac and Sons.
- Mm.

33:03.806 --> 33:06.473
The big one.

33:06.475 --> 33:09.977
Joey, please go wait in the car.

33:09.979 --> 33:12.529
- Thank you.
- All righty.

33:12.565 --> 33:14.531
Okay, you go right in.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.867
Bye, kid. See you soon, huh?

33:23.659 --> 33:25.209
Okay.

33:25.244 --> 33:26.994
This is a very nice chunk.

33:26.996 --> 33:29.163
We can parlay this kind of investment

33:29.165 --> 33:30.330
into something good, Abby.

33:30.382 --> 33:32.332
It's not an investment.

33:32.334 --> 33:34.468
Well, a loan. It's okay. I'm good for it.

33:34.503 --> 33:36.220
It's not a loan either.

33:36.255 --> 33:37.838
And honestly, Mr. Isaacs, I
don't care what you do with it

33:37.840 --> 33:39.890
as long as you stay away from us.

33:41.343 --> 33:43.177
It's what you came for, isn't it?

33:43.229 --> 33:45.229
Money.

33:47.349 --> 33:49.516
I should've known.

33:49.568 --> 33:51.685
Look at you.

33:51.687 --> 33:53.987
Your fancy handbag.

33:54.023 --> 33:56.023
Cute little hat.

33:56.025 --> 34:00.327
I bet your family's been paying
people off for generations.

34:00.362 --> 34:02.996
Charlie was right about you.

34:03.032 --> 34:05.916
And, you know, I don't know how he
turned himself into the man he is today

34:05.951 --> 34:08.368
with a role model like you.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.704
You think you know the
man you're married to?

34:10.706 --> 34:12.672
I know that you used him to place bets

34:12.708 --> 34:14.507
and count cards when he was just a child.

34:14.543 --> 34:16.092
Yeah? Was he a child nine years ago

34:16.128 --> 34:17.678
when he lured me to his apartment

34:17.713 --> 34:19.513
and he had the cops waiting for me?

34:19.547 --> 34:21.849
What kind of man sends a father to prison

34:21.884 --> 34:23.550
full of guys that wanna kill him?

34:23.601 --> 34:26.386
But you wanna know the worst part?

34:26.438 --> 34:29.106
The way he could look me in the eye

34:29.141 --> 34:30.858
and lie to my face.

34:30.893 --> 34:33.060
15 years in the business,

34:33.112 --> 34:35.562
best poker face I've ever seen.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.864
So, Mrs. Isaacs, think about that

34:37.900 --> 34:40.033
next time you're sitting
across from your husband

34:40.069 --> 34:41.534
at the dinner table.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.904
And think about it the
next time he tells you

34:43.906 --> 34:45.572
where he was at night.

34:45.574 --> 34:49.576
If I was you, I wouldn't
believe anything he says.

35:04.093 --> 35:06.426
No holding hands, I told you.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.095
I need it for stability.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.314
I've got an inner ear disorder.

35:10.349 --> 35:12.599
It's just physical, you know that, right?

35:12.651 --> 35:14.434
You realize that is exactly

35:14.486 --> 35:16.820
what every man has been
waiting to hear his entire life.

35:16.855 --> 35:18.989
Well, you're welcome.

35:19.024 --> 35:21.108
And, um, thank you.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.826
I never thought a patent lawyer

35:22.861 --> 35:25.445
would be so avant-garde in bed.

35:25.497 --> 35:26.613
Well, I could say the same thing

35:26.665 --> 35:29.917
for a theoretical physicist.

35:29.952 --> 35:31.835
Just don't go clipping at my heels, okay?

35:31.870 --> 35:33.170
This isn't real life.

35:33.205 --> 35:36.006
It's just some twisted holiday.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.791
Well, it doesn't have to be.

35:37.793 --> 35:40.928
I could be your at-home husband.

35:40.963 --> 35:43.347
I could... I could cook you dinner.

35:43.382 --> 35:46.133
Oh, yeah? You wanna
live on a woman's salary?

35:46.185 --> 35:49.303
The work you've been doing on
compressed neutron generators...

35:49.355 --> 35:50.938
Do you know what that could do for you?

35:50.973 --> 35:52.356
Yeah, zilch.

35:52.391 --> 35:54.308
It's worthless as a bomb initiator.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.525
Yeah, but it's worth millions

35:55.561 --> 35:57.811
if you're looking for oil.

35:57.813 --> 36:00.113
The president of Texaco, he doesn't
care what's between your legs.

36:00.149 --> 36:02.950
It's what's in your noggin
that's gonna buy him a yacht.

36:02.985 --> 36:05.986
Yeah, but what's in my
noggin belongs to Uncle Sam.

36:05.988 --> 36:07.821
That's why you're here, right?

36:07.873 --> 36:10.707
It only belongs to Uncle
Sam if I tell him about it.

36:23.839 --> 36:25.639
From the colonel himself.

36:25.674 --> 36:27.841
You're officially a free man.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.514
Is he expecting me?

36:34.566 --> 36:36.350
Henry?

36:36.352 --> 36:38.352
Is that what's eating you?

36:38.404 --> 36:40.904
There's no trick to fatherhood, Paul.

36:40.939 --> 36:43.857
He'll worship you no matter your faults.

36:43.859 --> 36:45.442
It's what sons do.

36:48.197 --> 36:50.364
If I've never said it before...

36:52.201 --> 36:53.867
thank you.

37:30.239 --> 37:34.207
- Turn off the engine and raise your hands.
- Shit. Stitch your trap, Paul.

37:34.243 --> 37:36.910
- You know nothing. They can't prove anything.
- Come with us.

37:38.247 --> 37:40.080
- Cheerio, mates.
- Ah!

37:49.842 --> 37:51.558
So what's next, Frank?

37:51.593 --> 37:54.761
We go back to the original designs.

37:54.813 --> 37:57.431
Maybe I built a flaw in the
system without knowing it.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.599
No, what's next for you?

37:59.651 --> 38:01.485
After all this is over.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.071
Where do you go after the Hill?

38:04.106 --> 38:05.989
Wherever my wife goes.

38:07.776 --> 38:09.326
Thought you two were done.

38:09.361 --> 38:11.995
Yeah, I'm the flaw in that system.

38:12.030 --> 38:14.164
Call it human error.

38:14.199 --> 38:16.450
I'm still working on fixing it.

38:19.538 --> 38:22.622
I haven't been husband of the year.

38:22.624 --> 38:26.009
At least you didn't trap Abby here twice.

38:27.796 --> 38:29.963
At least your kid is still with you.

38:32.968 --> 38:35.602
The things I've done
since I got to the Hill...

38:35.637 --> 38:38.472
My father went to prison for less,

38:38.474 --> 38:41.641
yet somehow here I am.

38:46.315 --> 38:48.398
I got a man killed.

38:52.488 --> 38:54.321
Sid Liao.

38:55.824 --> 38:58.542
Sid Liao? Sid Liao was a spy.

38:58.577 --> 39:01.495
No, he wasn't a spy.

39:01.497 --> 39:04.631
- He made a stupid mistake.
- He was trying to escape.

39:04.666 --> 39:07.334
He came to me for help.

39:08.837 --> 39:11.922
And instead of helping
him, I exploited him.

39:14.176 --> 39:16.676
Implosion was on the ropes.

39:17.846 --> 39:19.846
So it was Sid or my group.

39:21.266 --> 39:22.482
I don't blame the kid who shot him.

39:22.518 --> 39:23.900
I don't blame Sid.

39:23.936 --> 39:26.186
There's only one person I can blame.

39:29.858 --> 39:33.660
You come here believing that
you're here to save lives.

39:33.695 --> 39:37.497
And you tell yourself you sacrifice the few

39:37.533 --> 39:38.698
to save the many.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.001
Pretty soon...

39:41.036 --> 39:44.037
everything's negotiable
and you can't remember

39:44.039 --> 39:47.007
what you came here for in the first place.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.543
It's all turned around.

39:55.217 --> 39:56.800
It...

39:58.604 --> 40:00.303
Wait.

40:02.891 --> 40:04.724
It was turned around.

40:08.230 --> 40:11.198
Frank? You seein' something?

40:11.233 --> 40:13.233
Tell me.

40:14.653 --> 40:16.319
Frank!

40:17.456 --> 40:19.406
Hey!

40:22.411 --> 40:24.294
Say you're me, Charlie.

40:24.329 --> 40:26.913
You want a voice in how the gadget's used.

40:26.915 --> 40:28.882
You wanna minimize how
many more lives it takes.

40:28.917 --> 40:31.251
- You wanna turn things back around.
- This isn't a game.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.420
If you figured it out, tell me.

40:33.472 --> 40:37.224
Darrow's gonna give a scientist
a seat on the Target Committee.

40:37.259 --> 40:40.093
We have to use this as leverage.

40:47.102 --> 40:49.019
Wait a minute, it's you.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.906
They're giving that seat to you.

40:52.941 --> 40:54.441
I'm the head of the technical staff.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.611
Say you're me

40:57.613 --> 40:59.779
and you're suddenly talking to the guy

40:59.781 --> 41:02.449
who gets to help dictate
how the bomb is used.

41:04.169 --> 41:06.620
And that guy wants to know
what happened to his test.

41:06.622 --> 41:08.955
- What would you do then?
- What is this?

41:10.008 --> 41:11.541
Blackmail?

41:14.963 --> 41:16.680
Let's call this a...

41:17.883 --> 41:19.633
A negotiation.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.469
Bloody Yanks.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.341
If this is some sort of prank,

41:49.343 --> 41:51.309
I see no humor in it.

41:51.345 --> 41:54.229
I am a member of the Royal Society.

41:54.264 --> 41:57.315
Lord Halifax is a personal friend.

41:57.351 --> 41:58.850
I wonder what he'd have to say

41:58.902 --> 42:00.852
if he knew you imprisoned a Briton

42:00.854 --> 42:02.687
in a beef locker.

42:02.739 --> 42:04.072
How about a Briton

42:04.107 --> 42:05.690
carrying a bag full

42:05.692 --> 42:09.361
of atomic secrets off a military base?

42:10.531 --> 42:12.364
Or...

42:12.416 --> 42:16.868
are these just souvenirs
of your trip to America?

42:19.289 --> 42:21.840
I packed five suits and a Dopp kit.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.092
I've never seen those papers before.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.095
You don't think that...

42:27.130 --> 42:28.847
Paul Crosley...

42:28.882 --> 42:30.522
could have been involved in some sort of...

42:30.551 --> 42:32.217
Oh, my God.

42:32.219 --> 42:35.053
Committing espionage
right out of my office.

42:35.055 --> 42:37.389
He has seemed out of sorts.

42:47.901 --> 42:50.318
I'm afraid this is the
curtain call, William.

42:52.406 --> 42:53.905
Whatever he's told you, Colonel,

42:53.907 --> 42:55.874
the man is an inveterate liar.

42:55.909 --> 42:58.410
You recruited Paul, Dr. Hogarth.

42:58.445 --> 43:00.478
Told him who to contact.

43:00.514 --> 43:03.215
What information to collect.
Isn't that the truth?

43:03.250 --> 43:05.050
It's also become apparent that the British

43:05.085 --> 43:06.918
have been keeping atomic
secrets of their own

43:06.954 --> 43:08.587
from the Americans.

43:08.622 --> 43:10.422
And you from me.

43:10.457 --> 43:11.823
So you're going to hand over

43:11.858 --> 43:13.458
every morsel the king has been holding.

43:13.493 --> 43:15.794
Are you taking the piss?

43:15.829 --> 43:18.496
Your coconspirators at Site X

43:18.532 --> 43:20.765
are sitting in rooms just like this one.

43:20.801 --> 43:22.100
And they're cooperating with us,

43:22.135 --> 43:25.270
so I'll let you consider your options.

43:35.832 --> 43:39.501
You'd betray the
grandfather of your only son?

43:41.455 --> 43:42.837
You're going to

43:42.873 --> 43:45.340
retract your statement.

43:45.375 --> 43:49.094
Claim full responsibility like a man.

43:49.129 --> 43:50.679
If you ever want to hold your boy...

43:50.714 --> 43:53.131
Oh, I did want to hold my boy, actually.

43:53.133 --> 43:54.766
I did.

43:54.801 --> 43:57.469
Holding his photograph
seemed the next best thing.

43:57.471 --> 44:00.855
So I took the snapshot out
of the frame on your desk

44:00.891 --> 44:03.058
and I turned it around.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.646
September 1932.

44:07.698 --> 44:11.449
So that would make him, what, 17?

44:11.485 --> 44:12.951
Who is he?

44:12.986 --> 44:14.869
You know, I even convinced myself

44:14.905 --> 44:17.155
that he looked like me.

44:17.207 --> 44:21.326
But then Lucy never got Henry back,

44:21.378 --> 44:22.877
did she?

44:27.384 --> 44:29.668
How long have you known?

44:29.670 --> 44:32.053
Five months, give or take.

44:33.557 --> 44:35.924
And all this time...

44:37.561 --> 44:39.811
you and your new friend

44:39.846 --> 44:42.897
have been waiting like
two snakes in the grass?

44:42.933 --> 44:44.983
It's all been logged, William.

44:45.018 --> 44:48.320
Every conversation, every scrap
of intelligence we've stolen.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.738
Be smart.

44:49.773 --> 44:51.856
Tell the truth about what the British know

44:51.858 --> 44:53.858
and maybe you'll avoid that noose

44:53.860 --> 44:55.944
that you've been worried about.

44:59.783 --> 45:02.033
I pity you.

45:03.420 --> 45:05.370
No friends.

45:05.372 --> 45:07.539
No family.

45:07.591 --> 45:09.541
No loyalty,

45:09.543 --> 45:10.875
dignity,

45:10.927 --> 45:12.711
honor.

45:12.713 --> 45:16.381
You are a man without a country.

45:16.383 --> 45:19.267
And without iron round his wrists.

45:19.302 --> 45:21.269
Shall we begin?

45:24.391 --> 45:26.107
We have power, Charlie.

45:26.143 --> 45:28.226
Are we really gonna keep
using it to hurt people?

45:28.278 --> 45:30.445
You're really gonna
hold the project hostage?

45:30.480 --> 45:32.897
Germany's about to sign a peace treaty.

45:32.899 --> 45:34.566
All eyes are turning east

45:34.618 --> 45:36.234
toward an enemy that doesn't look like us

45:36.236 --> 45:37.736
and doesn't talk like us.

45:37.788 --> 45:40.789
That makes it pretty easy
to cast them as barbarians

45:40.824 --> 45:42.374
and justify a massacre.

45:42.409 --> 45:44.075
What do you want, Frank?

45:45.629 --> 45:48.079
We've both stumbled.

45:48.081 --> 45:50.248
Now we can stand up straight together.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.967
We can do the right thing.

45:53.003 --> 45:55.637
You're a leader.

45:55.672 --> 45:58.173
People look to you for
guidance, so guide them.

45:59.176 --> 46:00.592
Convince the Target Committee

46:00.644 --> 46:03.228
to demonstrate the bomb
on an uninhabited island.

46:03.263 --> 46:05.814
Show the world our power and our restraint.

46:05.849 --> 46:07.599
How do you know that's the right decision?

46:07.601 --> 46:08.767
How do you know it's enough to end the war?

46:08.819 --> 46:09.934
It doesn't matter what I know.

46:09.936 --> 46:11.436
You know that this is right.

46:12.773 --> 46:14.773
I have to believe that's true.

46:14.825 --> 46:18.443
'Cause the truth is I can't
force you to do anything.

46:18.495 --> 46:19.844
The reason we're both standing here

46:19.880 --> 46:21.780
is you can see the path forward to the bomb

46:21.782 --> 46:23.081
as clearly as I can

46:23.116 --> 46:24.666
and you always could.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.003
You were gonna see this, too,

46:29.039 --> 46:31.172
eventually.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.124
The detonators?

46:33.176 --> 46:35.960
It was the first thing I checked.

46:35.962 --> 46:38.430
Red to positive, yellow to negative, right?

46:38.465 --> 46:40.465
That's what the specs say.

46:47.808 --> 46:49.968
What if things got turned around?

46:53.313 --> 46:55.313
The polarity?

46:55.315 --> 46:57.649
All of these wires, theywere all...

46:57.651 --> 47:00.201
they were all color-coded by hand, right?

47:00.237 --> 47:03.121
Well, what if someone accidentally

47:03.156 --> 47:06.157
dipped the brush in the wrong can of paint?

47:12.749 --> 47:15.049
Jesus.

47:15.085 --> 47:18.002
What if the charges got turned around?

47:39.576 --> 47:42.026
You did the right thing, Frank.

47:44.414 --> 47:46.948
And I know you will, too.

47:51.204 --> 47:53.037
"I hereby declare on oath

47:53.089 --> 47:54.706
that I absolutely and entirely

47:54.708 --> 47:58.042
renounce and abjure all
allegiance and fidelity

47:58.044 --> 47:59.594
to any foreign prince,

47:59.629 --> 48:01.679
potentate, state, or sovereignty"...

48:01.715 --> 48:03.214
That's good enough, Paul.

48:03.216 --> 48:04.849
I hereby declare you

48:04.885 --> 48:06.565
a citizen of the United States of America.

48:08.054 --> 48:09.771
Welcome home, son.

49:20.961 --> 49:23.344
How long did it take him to figure it out?

49:23.380 --> 49:25.630
He didn't.

49:25.632 --> 49:27.348
I had to feed him the answer.

49:27.384 --> 49:30.935
I told you not to bet on that boy.

49:30.971 --> 49:32.353
Yeah, well...

49:33.690 --> 49:35.556
we're all betting on him now.
