- SARAH: Howard?

00:56.205 --> 00:57.784
Howard, dear, are you scared?

00:57.915 --> 01:01.367
There's no need to be frightened,
the storm can't hurt you.

01:01.627 --> 01:03.751
It... It's not that, Mother.

01:04.296 --> 01:07.215
It's just...
Tonight's the night we visit Father.

01:07.341 --> 01:09.002
In the bad place.

01:09.218 --> 01:10.250
Oh, Howard.

01:10.386 --> 01:14.385
He's really looking forward to seeing you.
You're all he has left.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.148
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:40.332 --> 01:43.953
Just hold my hand, Howard.
Everything will be fine.

01:45.713 --> 01:47.173
I don't like this place, Mother.

01:47.298 --> 01:51.628
I know, darling. I don't either.
But you know why we've come.

01:51.886 --> 01:55.303
I'm certain your father
will want to see you on his birthday.

02:03.314 --> 02:04.726
Good evening, Dr. West.

02:04.857 --> 02:06.138
I received your message.

02:06.275 --> 02:08.185
I know there's been no official change,

02:08.318 --> 02:11.736
but I thought my husband could see his son
on his birthday.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.822
Mrs Lovecraft,

02:13.949 --> 02:18.411
I wish I could tell you that seeing his son
would be therapeutic for your husband,

02:18.537 --> 02:23.034
but Winfield's mind
is like a shattered looking-glass.

02:23.167 --> 02:24.199
That's a good one.

02:24.335 --> 02:28.120
"Shattered... Looking... Glass." (CHUCKLES)

02:28.798 --> 02:33.585
But in all honesty, I'm more concerned
about the harm it could do to the boy

02:33.719 --> 02:36.674
- to see his father in this state.
- (GROANS)

02:36.931 --> 02:39.387
But haven't the treatments
shown any progress?

02:39.517 --> 02:41.557
Oh, don't expect him to tango.

02:41.685 --> 02:45.269
"Progress" is such an inexact term,
Mrs Lovecraft.

02:45.397 --> 02:49.479
Most assuredly we have done everything
within medical boundaries to assist,

02:49.610 --> 02:53.656
even a few things outside
of those boundaries to be honest.

02:53.781 --> 02:56.320
I feel for you, and the child,

02:56.450 --> 02:59.867
but Winfield is still showing
extreme nervous exhaustion

02:59.995 --> 03:02.072
and nothing is calming him down.

03:02.206 --> 03:04.164
I cannot advise visitation.

03:04.792 --> 03:08.791
I just... I was hoping on his birthday
he could actually see his son.

03:08.921 --> 03:10.630
Oh, why listen to me?

03:10.756 --> 03:13.877
I'm merely a highly-trained professional
with expert opinions

03:14.009 --> 03:16.217
on the secrets of life and death.

03:16.345 --> 03:19.098
SARAH: I don't know. Whatever am I to do?

03:29.275 --> 03:32.395
DOCTOR: Come along, Mrs Lovecraft.
Come along.

03:32.528 --> 03:36.396
A little fatherly fear never hurt anyone.

03:37.116 --> 03:40.071
I hear a lot of writers
are made that way, in fact.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.291
WINFIELD: He's coming.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.416
He's coming.

03:53.674 --> 03:55.881
- King Abdul...

03:58.179 --> 04:00.256
He always took care of everything.

04:00.598 --> 04:02.307

04:07.229 --> 04:08.725

He's coming.

04:11.525 --> 04:16.188
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming,
he's coming, he's coming.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.065
HOWARD: Father, it's me.

04:18.449 --> 04:20.277
It's Howard. Who's coming?

04:20.409 --> 04:21.988
WINFIELD: Abdul Alhazred.

04:22.119 --> 04:24.694
King Abdul. He is coming.

04:25.039 --> 04:27.116
HOWARD: Father, please speak to me.

04:27.249 --> 04:30.204
WINFIELD: He's coming, he's... (GASPS)

04:30.336 --> 04:32.413
- Howard?
- HOWARD: Father.

04:32.546 --> 04:34.125
Howard, son.

04:34.256 --> 04:35.420
Listen!

04:35.549 --> 04:36.665
Listen to me!

04:36.801 --> 04:38.593
I made a mistake.

04:38.719 --> 04:40.962
No. I discovered it.

04:41.096 --> 04:42.508
(CHUCKLING) A mistake...

04:42.890 --> 04:44.350
A glorious mistake.

04:44.475 --> 04:47.430
Father, I miss you. I miss you so much.

04:47.561 --> 04:49.389
Listen to me, son.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.681
Listen! But not to King Abdul.

04:51.816 --> 04:53.062
And not to the words.

04:53.192 --> 04:56.776
Don't ever listen to the words! Or symbols!

04:56.946 --> 05:00.612
The symbols will speak to you,
but do not listen.

05:01.033 --> 05:03.074
Listen to me.

05:03.452 --> 05:04.734
I saw it.

05:04.912 --> 05:06.288
I heard it.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.206
Should never have been written. Ever.

05:08.332 --> 05:09.329
My mistake.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.251
I never should have.

05:11.627 --> 05:14.664
Howard. The words. The symbols.

05:15.172 --> 05:16.584
Do not look.

05:16.757 --> 05:18.418
Do not listen.

05:18.676 --> 05:20.800
Do not read.

05:20.928 --> 05:22.922
- Father.
- Swear it!

05:23.055 --> 05:25.547
King Abdul, the Necronomicon,

05:25.683 --> 05:28.850
the words, the symbols, they will lead to...

05:29.103 --> 05:30.931

- Please.
- The Necronomicon, destroy it, Howard!

05:43.325 --> 05:46.411
- Destroy it for my sake, for yours!
- (GASPING) Let go!

05:46.537 --> 05:47.949
What do you think you're doing?

05:48.080 --> 05:52.245
He must remain sleeping!
The Necronomicon must be destroyed, son!

05:52.376 --> 05:53.836
- (STRUGGLING) Help!
- DOCTOR: Orderly.

05:53.961 --> 05:59.169
The symbols must be destroyed,
before they destroy us all!

05:59.300 --> 06:00.499
DOCTOR: Orderlies!

06:01.510 --> 06:03.800
Swear you'll destroy it!

06:03.971 --> 06:06.380

06:06.515 --> 06:08.010
DOCTOR: Restrain him!

06:09.643 --> 06:11.518
WINFIELD: I see the symbols.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.185
And it's madness.

(WINFIELD LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

(SIGHS)

06:42.218 --> 06:45.338
Why did you take him there
in the first place?

06:46.013 --> 06:50.094
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- No, Mary, you're right.

06:50.226 --> 06:51.935
I mean, I have to raise Howard alone.

06:52.061 --> 06:56.106
Oh, shh now. It's all right.

06:56.357 --> 06:58.267
I'll help you, Sarah.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.777
We all will.

06:59.902 --> 07:01.148
I just worry.

07:01.278 --> 07:02.939
He's always been an odd child.

07:03.072 --> 07:06.489
That imagination of his,
it puts off the other children.

07:06.992 --> 07:09.911
Now all he ever does
is sit in his room alone and read.

07:10.037 --> 07:12.327
There's nothing wrong
with Howard loving to read.

07:12.456 --> 07:15.542
It's the only reasonable trait
my nephew left his son.

07:15.668 --> 07:19.002
Must be in the blood
because Winfield was never around.

07:19.130 --> 07:23.543
His incredible curiosity
led to dark journeys.

07:23.843 --> 07:28.256
Ever since he was a boy,
Winfield had a hunger for knowledge.

07:28.389 --> 07:32.518
He was always reading, always exploring.

07:32.643 --> 07:35.930
I don't think he ever
took the same road home twice.

07:36.355 --> 07:39.807
There was always something more to know.

07:39.942 --> 07:44.071
But it never occurred to me
such a toll that life took on him.

07:44.196 --> 07:50.651
The stories that would come out of his mouth
grew from strange, to utter madness.

07:50.786 --> 07:51.985
Until...

07:52.121 --> 07:56.831
Well, we must deal with what's
in front of us, here and now.

07:56.959 --> 08:00.874
But the worrying,
that he gets from you, Sarah.

08:01.005 --> 08:02.666
He's my son, Mary.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.839
And he gets sick so often.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.293
What kind of mother would I be
if I didn't worry?

08:07.428 --> 08:09.836
He's turned a corner, Sarah.

08:09.972 --> 08:12.760
He's much healthier now than he was.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.644
Things will turn out all right
in the end, dear.

08:15.769 --> 08:17.395
Just give them a chance to.

08:17.521 --> 08:19.848
Howard will be just fine.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.358
You'll see.

08:23.277 --> 08:25.105
I can't sleep.

08:31.952 --> 08:35.784
I know today was difficult, sweetheart.
But you need to get some sleep.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.078
You're a growing boy.

08:37.207 --> 08:39.496
Your father loves you so much.

08:39.751 --> 08:44.130
- Could you tell me a story?
- I'm not very good at telling stories.

08:44.632 --> 08:46.921
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

09:11.033 --> 09:12.232
This was your father's.

09:12.368 --> 09:15.037
I wasn't sure
when I was gonna give it to you.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.699
- It's a book.
- It's a journal.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.704
He wrote it a long time ago,
back when he was well.

09:21.836 --> 09:24.921
- Before his nervous exhaustion?
- Yes.

09:25.256 --> 09:27.166
He told me how he wanted you to have it.

09:27.299 --> 09:28.925
You're sure I can read this?

09:29.051 --> 09:31.590
You can read it until you fall asleep,
if you like.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.548
All right, Mother.

09:34.306 --> 09:36.051
I love you, Howard.

I've got your hand... Tentacle... Thing.

16:11.078 --> 16:13.119
- (STRAINING) Almost there.
- (GRUNTS)

16:14.456 --> 16:17.031
Pull yourself up!

16:18.586 --> 16:20.460
(ROARING)

16:30.764 --> 16:31.880
Saved life.

16:32.016 --> 16:33.013
You Master.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.182
Me Thu Thu Hmong.

16:35.311 --> 16:36.557
"Soo Soo Human"?

16:36.687 --> 16:39.356
- Thu Thu Hmong.
- "Su-Su-Sudio"?

16:39.482 --> 16:41.309
Thu Thu Hmong.

16:41.442 --> 16:44.360
I literally have no idea what you're saying.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.483
I'm gonna call you Spot.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.189
Spot.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.742
- "Spot"?
- Spot.

16:51.869 --> 16:53.068
Spot.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.951
- Master Howard.
- Hey, you promised.

16:57.124 --> 16:58.406
Master cold.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.293
Spot makes warm.

17:00.669 --> 17:02.213
Uh, thank you.

17:04.714 --> 17:06.175
I need to get back home.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.874
My mother and my father need me.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.634
(GRUNTS)

17:14.016 --> 17:15.844
Is your mom a squid?

17:16.060 --> 17:19.015
Oh, wait. She was a dragon, right?

17:20.981 --> 17:21.978
(EXCLAIMS)

17:58.060 --> 18:00.683
(HUMMING)

18:15.828 --> 18:17.822
Oh, sire!

18:17.955 --> 18:18.952
(COUGHS) Oh, noble one.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.538
The mighty ruler of 1,000 skies.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.495
I have news.

18:23.752 --> 18:24.833
Go on.

18:25.129 --> 18:26.410
Please, do tell.

18:26.547 --> 18:30.676
Your Majesty, I...
I think he has arrived, sire.

18:30.801 --> 18:33.637
"He"? As in He from the prophecy?

18:33.762 --> 18:35.341
Yes, he appeared.

18:35.473 --> 18:39.970
In the heart of storm out of nowhere,
as if ripped from the other realm,

18:40.102 --> 18:42.771
just as the book foretold it,
before the book was lost.

18:42.897 --> 18:44.060
A boy?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.479
- You're sure it's a boy?
- Oh, positive, sire.

18:46.609 --> 18:48.567
He's so... He's so pink.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.482
- Where is he now?
- He encountered the sleeping one.

18:51.614 --> 18:55.233
- They appear to be travelling together.
- Good.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.951
- But where are they going?
- Uh, I don't know, Your Majesty.

18:59.079 --> 19:02.912
You said to announce it at once
if the outlander arrived.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.412
And, well, he did... Uh, so I did.

19:07.087 --> 19:08.499
I did say that.

19:08.631 --> 19:09.711
Well done.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.466
- Really?
- Yes.

19:11.592 --> 19:13.502
Now go back out there and find them.

19:13.636 --> 19:16.092
That shouldn't be too hard
for the likes of you.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.548
Please do keep an eye on guests.

19:18.974 --> 19:21.763
I want to make sure
they arrive here safe and sound.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.682
At once, Your Highness.

19:25.606 --> 19:26.603
(GRUNTS)

19:40.830 --> 19:43.203
- Spot?
- Hmm? Yes?

19:43.332 --> 19:45.491
- Where are we exactly?
- R'lyeh.

19:45.626 --> 19:49.162
- And that's a place, is it?
- R'lyeh.

19:49.296 --> 19:52.382
Even more helpful the second time.
Thank you, Spot.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.666
Where Master from?

19:54.802 --> 19:58.136
Oh, well, my home is
Providence, Rhode Island.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.593
That's where I need to go.

19:59.723 --> 20:03.307
Where "Prow Vow Dense Row Die Land"?

20:03.477 --> 20:06.930
- Um, it's in New England.
- "New Winged Land"?

20:07.064 --> 20:09.307
- You've never heard of it?
- Have heard of it.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.482
- Really?
- Master said it.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.479
- So, you've just heard of it right now?
- Yes.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.155
- Really not helpful.
- No.

20:18.284 --> 20:21.451
Master here now. Master safe.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.825
So, uh, any idea
how we can get back to my home?

20:27.334 --> 20:29.791
Friends close.

20:54.695 --> 20:55.692
(GASPS)

21:01.410 --> 21:02.870
- Go.
- (GRUNTS)

21:03.245 --> 21:04.409
Meet.

21:05.289 --> 21:06.453
Hello?

21:06.832 --> 21:07.864
Hello.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.041
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.661
My friend Spot says you are friends of his.

21:13.047 --> 21:14.922
- Friends.
- Right.

21:15.466 --> 21:17.506
You call him "Spot"?

21:17.635 --> 21:20.304
Well, yeah. He does have spots on him.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.426
I see.

21:21.847 --> 21:22.927
What do you want?

21:23.057 --> 21:24.054
Spot?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.722
Friends provide Master Howard food?

21:26.977 --> 21:29.185
- Hmm. Warm?
- I see.

21:29.730 --> 21:32.732
- What does that make us?
- Favour.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.189
Very well.

21:34.318 --> 21:35.778
Oh, thank you very much.

21:35.903 --> 21:39.106
- You're not from here.
- No, I'm not.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.984
I'm very far from home.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.613
I've forgotten my manners.

21:42.743 --> 21:45.235
I'm Gotha, and this is my brother Davik.

21:46.330 --> 21:47.659
He doesn't speak.

21:47.790 --> 21:51.326
Do come in.
It's as he says, it will be night soon.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.454
- It gets very cold.
- (CHUCKLES)

21:53.671 --> 21:55.083
I would believe that!

21:55.214 --> 21:56.495
What about Spot?

21:56.632 --> 21:59.587
Sorry, I'm afraid he'll have to stay outside.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.636
Spot is fine.

22:02.012 --> 22:03.472
Body not get cold.

22:03.597 --> 22:06.220
Well, all right. If you say so.

22:11.730 --> 22:12.976
Whoa!

22:13.107 --> 22:14.104
Sorry?

22:14.233 --> 22:15.313
HOWARD: Your home!

22:15.442 --> 22:17.317
It's so big in here!

22:17.653 --> 22:19.029
Of course it is.

22:19.155 --> 22:21.563
Is that strange to you?

22:21.699 --> 22:22.862
Where I'm from,

22:22.992 --> 22:27.453
our buildings are the same size
on the outside and the inside.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.991
Fascinating.

22:30.416 --> 22:33.085
- You have dark circles under your eyes.
- HOWARD: Huh?

22:33.210 --> 22:34.587
I love food.

22:34.712 --> 22:37.085
- Are you Father Dagon?
- HOWARD: No.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.549
Oh, I forgot my manners.

22:39.675 --> 22:41.170
How rude of me.

22:41.469 --> 22:42.750
I'm Howard.

22:42.887 --> 22:45.723
- Howard Lovecraft.
- What?

22:45.848 --> 22:48.091
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

22:48.225 --> 22:52.094
- Is that a common name where you're from?
- Sure. Lots of boys are named Howard.

22:52.229 --> 22:53.539
I mean "Lovecraft".

22:53.689 --> 22:55.101
Oh! No.

22:55.232 --> 22:56.229
Just me.

22:56.358 --> 22:57.439
Why?

22:57.943 --> 23:00.067
- This is Innes and this is Tw'i.
- (CHUCKLING)

23:00.196 --> 23:02.522
Did you know a Shoggoth can crush a penguin?

23:02.656 --> 23:05.528
I love fruit. But not sticky ones.

23:05.659 --> 23:09.243
Davik, take your sisters
and you can all go wash your suckers.

23:09.371 --> 23:10.617
It's almost time for supper.

23:12.249 --> 23:14.919
Forgive us. We don't get too many visitors.

23:15.044 --> 23:17.618
- But you've met someone like me before?
- Yes.

23:17.755 --> 23:19.547
Who? What was he like?

23:19.673 --> 23:23.257
Oh, he was a giddy young man,
and very curious about things.

23:23.385 --> 23:26.921
He talked very quickly,
and about a great many things.

23:27.056 --> 23:31.386
He was very keen to explore.
He wanted to see everything.

23:31.519 --> 23:32.978
Do you remember his name?

23:33.103 --> 23:36.059
It was a peculiar sort of name, like yours.

23:36.398 --> 23:39.021
Not a proper name like Gotha or Davik.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.394
Warble? Winegrass?

23:41.529 --> 23:43.154
- HOWARD: Winfield?
- That was it.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.946
- That's my father! My father was here!
- So he was.

23:47.076 --> 23:50.327
How curious to meet two Lovecrafts
on the same path.

23:50.454 --> 23:53.409
- When? When did you meet him?
- I can't be sure.

23:53.541 --> 23:55.581
The winter has lasted so long.

23:55.709 --> 23:58.118
Would your parents know, perhaps?

23:58.254 --> 24:00.662
They haven't been home in a very long time.

24:00.798 --> 24:03.171
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

24:03.300 --> 24:07.299
It's just... When you said
you'd seen my father, I... I got excited.

24:07.429 --> 24:09.507
He's not himself any more.

24:14.562 --> 24:16.187
Over and up.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.690
Up and over.

24:32.621 --> 24:34.496
Dinner incoming.

24:42.798 --> 24:44.044
I love food!

24:44.175 --> 24:45.800
I hope it's squishy.

24:45.926 --> 24:47.505
Can't quite sit right.

24:47.636 --> 24:50.591
Don't worry.
Winfield had issues with sitting, too.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.131
His legs also bent in only one direction.

24:53.267 --> 24:56.222
No bending legs? How do you squiggle around?

24:56.353 --> 24:57.813
Or slime up a wall?

24:57.938 --> 25:01.059
Or squish in a crack to hide from bad guys?

25:01.192 --> 25:03.565
- Squishing is my favourite.
- Mine, too.

25:03.694 --> 25:07.527
It's like squeezing, but grosser!

25:07.656 --> 25:08.689
Food time now.

25:08.824 --> 25:10.485
Manners with company.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.029
We thank the meal first.

25:12.161 --> 25:14.404
Everyone has washed their tentacles?

25:15.539 --> 25:16.951
At least half of them.

25:17.082 --> 25:23.703
One is super clean. The other stays dirty
in case I need to use it for surprise attacks.

25:23.839 --> 25:26.675
- Who are you attacking?
- That's a surprise!

25:26.801 --> 25:32.756
I don't know about the tentacles,
but my 10 fingers are sparkling.

25:35.309 --> 25:37.801
(CHUCKLES) Because it's... Hence clean.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.226
Then grab hold and we'll start the meal.

25:41.565 --> 25:43.974
Thank you Dark Ones, and long may you sleep.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.602
Thank you Small Ones and those that we eat.

25:46.737 --> 25:49.490
Take the cold, bring back the green.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.107
Save us from creatures evil and mean.

25:52.243 --> 25:54.236
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

25:54.370 --> 25:55.913
Wait, what?

25:56.872 --> 25:58.700
- Ready.
- So ready!

25:58.833 --> 25:59.829
Ready.

25:59.959 --> 26:00.955
Ready for what?

26:01.085 --> 26:02.082
I like it.

26:02.211 --> 26:04.039
Don't worry, we'll make sure you get some.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.880
It's hard to catch your first try.

26:06.006 --> 26:08.498
You don't get gran where you're from?

26:08.717 --> 26:11.387
Uh, no. Not really.

26:11.637 --> 26:15.303
Where I'm from, we eat green veggies
and farm animals.

26:15.432 --> 26:17.307
It squishes in my mouth.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.933
Howard, tell us of these "fahar animals".

26:20.062 --> 26:23.313
Oh, we keep the bigger animals
in special areas.

26:23.607 --> 26:27.476
We drink their milk, wear their hides,
and eat their meat.

26:27.611 --> 26:28.893
Not sure about the rest.

26:29.029 --> 26:33.324
How destructive these creatures must be
that you have to devour them.

26:33.450 --> 26:36.073
Elder Ones forbid that they ever invade us.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.663
Oh, they're very gentle.

26:37.788 --> 26:39.996
We keep animals as pets, too.

26:40.124 --> 26:42.746
We're not supposed to play with our food.

26:42.877 --> 26:48.120
I name my food. I should call this next bite
"Howard" for our guest.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.209
- That's very sweet of you, Tw'i.
- Yeah, flattered.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.428
How is it that I can talk to you?

26:54.555 --> 26:57.510
- Did someone teach you English?
- Not exactly.

26:57.725 --> 26:59.932
We share what we call a lanaath.

27:00.144 --> 27:04.522
Munch, munch. Food, food.
Eat-a one, then eat-a brood.

27:04.648 --> 27:08.481
It kinda means...
"Transmission" would be the right word.

27:08.819 --> 27:11.145
We can speak without speaking.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.523
It's rather special
that you can do it, really.

27:13.657 --> 27:17.158
Worship me! Tell your people of my power!

27:17.369 --> 27:19.577
Could my father lanite?

27:19.705 --> 27:20.737
Lanaath.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.416
Yeah, that.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.377
- Could my father do that?
- Oh, my, yes.

27:25.503 --> 27:27.330
His was particularly strong.

27:27.463 --> 27:29.753
He would chat with us from many miles away.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.919
Some nights I swear I can still hear him.

27:33.052 --> 27:36.255
You should try it. Just focus and listen.

27:36.597 --> 27:38.057
Yum, yum, squishy.

27:38.182 --> 27:40.721
Well, all of you have been
really nice so far.

27:40.851 --> 27:43.770
So was Spot.
I mean, he was scary at first, but he...

27:43.896 --> 27:46.305
There are bad things out there, Howard.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.434
Badder than I know how to tell you.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.395
R'lyeh has many creatures.

27:50.528 --> 27:52.605
Some hidden, some waiting.

27:52.738 --> 27:56.025
All fierce and powerful in ways
that you can't imagine.

27:56.659 --> 27:58.451
That's right, Davik, like Shoggoth.

27:58.577 --> 28:00.370
He's got a big mouth.

28:00.496 --> 28:02.288
What about Nythgon?

28:02.581 --> 28:07.161
Don't like them, all sharp and shadows.
And there's tons of them.

28:12.758 --> 28:16.887
It's okay, twins. We don't mention his name.
You know that.

28:17.346 --> 28:20.514
He hasn't been seen for a long, long time.

28:20.850 --> 28:22.642
Nothing to worry about.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.935
So what you're saying is,
stay out of the darkness?

28:27.189 --> 28:29.859
What we're saying is,
this world may look cool and peaceful

28:29.984 --> 28:31.942
but you have to be very careful, Howard.

28:32.069 --> 28:35.071
Your father, he was curious.

28:35.197 --> 28:39.148
He liked to explore.
Perhaps he saw too much of our world.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.820
There are things that can harm you
in more ways that you can ever imagine.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.705
If you wake them, there might never be
a chance of you getting back home.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.502
(SCOFFS) Well...

28:48.669 --> 28:51.161
I mean, I could be grumpy
when I wake up, too.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.207
No, it's more than that, Howard.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.334
The One Who Sleeps, Cthulhu.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.177
The Great Dreamer.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.759
The Sleeper of R'lyeh.

28:59.889 --> 29:03.839
There are ancient creatures here, Howard.
He's the king of them.

29:03.976 --> 29:07.891
The power you need to go home
may be strong enough to wake him.

29:08.022 --> 29:10.348
You have to be very careful in your travels.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.769
You have to be even more careful
of who you call your friend.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.362
It tastes really good
when they wiggle, right?

29:18.491 --> 29:19.986
Yeah, it's...

29:20.117 --> 29:21.363
So good.

29:23.454 --> 29:25.744
Thank you so much
for taking me in for the night.

29:25.873 --> 29:28.246
- I really appreciate it.
- Of course.

29:28.375 --> 29:31.496
It's the least we can do
for an ally of Thu Thu Hmong.

29:31.629 --> 29:32.828
He's a friend.

29:32.963 --> 29:34.459
Well, for now.

29:35.591 --> 29:39.257
Howard, I want to talk to you
about something very important.

29:39.637 --> 29:42.343
I'm afraid that this place
isn't safe for you.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.675
Remember how you told me of your father?

29:44.809 --> 29:48.724
When I met him,
he was bright, curious, eager.

29:48.854 --> 29:52.189
The man you told me about
isn't that person any more.

29:52.316 --> 29:53.728
He has seen things.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.568
Things that changed him.

29:55.694 --> 29:56.775
What do you mean?

29:56.904 --> 30:00.239
I will shelter you here for the night,
but in the morning,

30:00.366 --> 30:04.067
you should make every effort to get home
as quickly as possible.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.995
I don't know how to get back.

30:06.121 --> 30:10.666
Then you should definitely stay with Spot
until you find your way home.

30:10.793 --> 30:11.790
Okay.

30:11.919 --> 30:14.755
Good night, Howard Lovecraft. Sleep well.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.292
Good night.

30:27.268 --> 30:28.264
(YAWNING)

30:29.019 --> 30:30.016
(GASPS)

30:34.400 --> 30:35.397
(GASPS)

30:40.114 --> 30:42.024
Whoa!

31:00.217 --> 31:01.381
What?

31:07.516 --> 31:08.513
(GROANS)

31:10.060 --> 31:11.057
(SCREAMS)

31:11.520 --> 31:12.517
(GASPS)

31:13.939 --> 31:16.016
Howard, are you all right?

31:17.359 --> 31:18.356
Uh-huh.

31:18.486 --> 31:20.195
- Did you dream?
- I think so.

31:20.321 --> 31:23.073
It's just... Got a little bit
jumbled in my head.

31:23.199 --> 31:24.480
Dreams often do.

31:24.617 --> 31:27.322
- Are you ready to begin the day?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:27.578 --> 31:31.624
Then I wish you luck, Howard Lovecraft.
And a safe journey.

31:36.337 --> 31:38.212
Hey, Howard, you left your dinner.

31:38.339 --> 31:39.538
Can I eat it?

31:41.842 --> 31:44.050
Bye, Howard, travel safe.

31:44.178 --> 31:45.721
We'll miss you.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.844
- Good morning, Spot.
- Morning, Master Howard.

31:49.099 --> 31:52.303
Spot, is there a great big castle somewhere?

31:52.436 --> 31:55.557
- Maybe in that direction?
- Yes.

31:55.815 --> 31:57.892
Good. Take me there, please.

31:58.025 --> 32:00.185
- Why?
- I saw it in my dream.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.893
- It seemed pretty important.
- Yes.

32:03.697 --> 32:05.490
Let's get a move on! (GRUNTS)

32:06.534 --> 32:07.530
(EXCLAIMS)

32:08.744 --> 32:09.741
Hmm.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.242
(GRUNTING)

32:16.794 --> 32:18.503
- Master?
- Yes, Spot?

32:18.629 --> 32:20.338
- Where you come from?
- What do you mean?

32:20.464 --> 32:23.003
- How your land different?
- Oh, that's easy.

32:23.217 --> 32:26.669
I mean, it's not like this all the time.

32:26.804 --> 32:31.182
We get snow, too, but we only get
a little bit, and only in the winter.

32:31.308 --> 32:33.267
- "A bit"?
- Um...

32:33.394 --> 32:36.930
Well, "a bit" would be
a lot less snow than this.

32:37.064 --> 32:38.061
Yes.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.314
I mean, here it just goes on
forever and ever,

32:40.442 --> 32:45.819
but where I'm from, I'm lucky if we get
enough snow to cancel school, or...

32:45.948 --> 32:49.033
- Not that it matters.
- Not matter?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.568
(SIGHS) Because when I'm at school,

32:51.704 --> 32:55.121
I see all the other children
being friends with each other.

32:55.249 --> 32:57.741
None of them wanna be friends with me.

32:57.877 --> 33:01.922
- Why?
- Because I'm, you know, different.

33:02.256 --> 33:07.500
Everybody in my family worries all the time.
About me or... Or my father.

33:07.887 --> 33:10.129
We don't take a lot of time to play.

33:10.264 --> 33:12.970
- Children should play.
- "Play"?

33:13.100 --> 33:17.099
I don't play at all, really. I like to read.
I like to read a lot.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.689
I love books.

33:18.814 --> 33:21.389
- Why?
- Books tell amazing stories.

33:21.692 --> 33:23.816
I read them for hours at a time.

33:23.944 --> 33:28.324
I've even tried writing a few stories
of my own, believe it or not.

33:28.449 --> 33:32.150
But books and proper stories,
they take you places.

33:32.453 --> 33:36.582
Although most of them don't actually
take you to another dimension.

33:36.707 --> 33:39.543
- Come here?
- Yeah. It was a book my father wrote.

33:39.668 --> 33:42.042
And I left it on my bed in my room.

33:42.797 --> 33:45.004
Oh, no! What am I gonna do?

33:45.132 --> 33:47.126
Master. Spot help.

33:47.510 --> 33:52.137
- How?
- Book take you here, book take you home.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.884
- How can you guess a thing like that?
- Spot smart.

33:56.018 --> 33:57.976
- Book is key.
- A book!

33:58.103 --> 33:59.978
I saw a book in my dream last night.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.775
It was in front of a huge door.

34:02.900 --> 34:03.897
Then?

34:04.026 --> 34:06.779
I was just about to get the book,
then something grabbed me.

34:06.904 --> 34:09.110
I'm just not sure what the door was for.

34:09.239 --> 34:12.158
Keeping me out or keeping something in?

34:12.284 --> 34:13.696
I miss my parents.

34:13.828 --> 34:15.905
- I wanna go home.
- We'll find it.

34:16.038 --> 34:19.822
Hope so. But first things first,
we have to get to the castle.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.415
Agree, Master Howard. Want more.

34:22.545 --> 34:24.004
We've talked about me a lot.

34:24.130 --> 34:27.665
- What about you? Do you have any family?
- What "family"?

34:27.800 --> 34:31.466
You have to have a mom and dad,
some brothers and sisters.

34:31.594 --> 34:32.925
You can't be all alone out here.

34:33.054 --> 34:36.924
R'lyeh not like New England. Many alone.

34:37.059 --> 34:41.888
Family not for helping. Family dangerous.
Family scary.

34:42.022 --> 34:44.597
Yeah, sometimes my family
can be pretty scary,

34:44.733 --> 34:47.107
but that doesn't mean
I don't wanna go back for them.

34:47.235 --> 34:49.146
I've never been away for this long before.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.190
Master Howard is sad.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.862
Play make happy? Show Spot play.

34:53.993 --> 34:59.783
Well, in a place like this, with all this snow,
I could see them building a lot of snowmen.

35:00.082 --> 35:01.494
"Snowmen."

35:01.625 --> 35:04.746
- Haven't you ever built a snowman before?
- No.

35:27.776 --> 35:29.854
What do you think? Do you like it?

35:29.987 --> 35:31.897
- Simulacrum.
- What?

35:32.031 --> 35:35.401
- What's a simulacrum?
- A copy of Master Howard.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.694
Oh. I do know that word.

35:38.162 --> 35:40.571
Spot, you really are smart.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.913
You should try making one of yourself.

35:51.091 --> 35:52.088
(CHUCKLES)

35:55.137 --> 35:57.427
Nice snow-Spot, Spot.

35:58.140 --> 35:59.635
More play.

35:59.809 --> 36:00.805

38:47.226 --> 38:48.602
- Master Howard!
- Hello.

38:49.103 --> 38:50.479
Master Howard!

38:50.604 --> 38:52.183
Hi, Spot. (GASPS)

38:52.898 --> 38:55.437
No, no, no, no.

38:58.612 --> 38:59.609
(GROANS)

39:11.083 --> 39:12.329
Whoa.

39:14.712 --> 39:15.827
R'lyeh.

39:15.963 --> 39:18.799
I guessed that, big guy.
This where the king lives?

39:18.924 --> 39:20.040
Not king.

39:20.176 --> 39:22.050
But powerful.

39:25.264 --> 39:26.463
Master?

39:27.057 --> 39:30.012
- Go?
- Uh... Oh. Yes. Yes.

39:57.421 --> 39:59.214
I... I don't know, Spot.

39:59.340 --> 40:01.666
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

40:15.773 --> 40:17.185
Welcome.

40:32.373 --> 40:34.746
Huh. This is not what I imagined.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.074
"Imagine"?

40:36.210 --> 40:39.497
Yeah. I thought in my head it would be...

40:39.630 --> 40:41.624
I don't know... Cleaner?

40:42.758 --> 40:44.218
It is creepy...

40:45.010 --> 40:46.671
And really dirty.

40:49.807 --> 40:51.468
There's no one here.

40:54.311 --> 40:59.354
Is someone gonna come out to greet us?
Or are we supposed to just walk in?

41:00.234 --> 41:03.604
- You have no idea, do you?
- Nope.

41:10.870 --> 41:12.662
This feels odd, doesn't it?

41:16.417 --> 41:18.457
Hey, Spot, quick question.

41:18.627 --> 41:21.879
I mean, shouldn't there be
people or creatures in this place?

41:33.058 --> 41:34.055

- but Spot?
- Yes?

43:32.261 --> 43:35.133

- What?

That won't work, Spot.

Spot?

44:20.893 --> 44:22.887
Now would be a good time to hurry.

46:27.645 --> 46:29.306
It's amazing.

46:30.105 --> 46:33.807
ENVOY: I present to you Thu Thu Hmong,

46:34.485 --> 46:36.064
- and...
- Howard.

46:36.278 --> 46:37.560
Howard Lovecraft.

46:37.863 --> 46:41.031
ENVOY: And his companion, Howard Lovecraft.

46:43.035 --> 46:44.067
ALGID: I...

46:44.245 --> 46:48.078
Have waited a lifetime
for the prophecy to finally come true.

46:49.083 --> 46:52.868
A strange visitor from a distant world
arrives out of nowhere?

46:53.003 --> 46:57.133
What fortuitous luck that brought you
and Thu Thu Hmong together.

46:57.925 --> 46:59.337
Tell me, Howard Lovecraft.

46:59.677 --> 47:02.632
Are you the one spoken of in our lost book?

47:02.930 --> 47:03.962
Lost book?

47:04.098 --> 47:07.384
Will you save our kingdom
from this endless winter?

47:11.814 --> 47:12.846
Hey!

47:13.149 --> 47:15.771
(STUTTERS) You're human, like me!

47:16.068 --> 47:18.607
You have broken the rules of the court!

47:19.029 --> 47:20.062
ALGID: No!

47:20.322 --> 47:22.115
Lower your weapons at once.

47:22.449 --> 47:24.194
Howard is our guest.

47:25.077 --> 47:27.367
I am Algid Bunk.

47:27.746 --> 47:28.743
Hi.

47:28.873 --> 47:30.154
Algid Bunk.

47:30.624 --> 47:32.867
It is truly a pleasure to meet you, Howard.

47:33.169 --> 47:36.124
I understand you've been making
men out of snow.

47:36.422 --> 47:38.250
That's simply astonishing.

47:38.716 --> 47:40.756
They do it all the time where I'm from.

47:40.885 --> 47:42.428
Your powers are amazing.

47:42.970 --> 47:45.177
It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.

47:45.514 --> 47:48.386
Thank you for not letting him kill me,
by the way.

47:48.601 --> 47:50.262
You're quite welcome. (CHUCKLES)

47:51.520 --> 47:54.890
We've been expecting you
for quite some time now, you know.

47:55.274 --> 47:56.935
- Really?
- ALGID: Of course!

47:57.401 --> 48:01.607
Please join me in my chambers,
I'll explain everything.

48:01.864 --> 48:03.858
- Can I bring Spot with me?
- What?

48:04.366 --> 48:07.404
I don't... I'm not familiar with this word.

48:07.870 --> 48:10.243
- "Spot."
- You know, I mean him.

48:10.664 --> 48:12.991
Thu Thu is Spot, is he?

48:13.584 --> 48:14.616
Very well.

48:15.294 --> 48:16.706
Spot may join us.

48:18.422 --> 48:19.834
Come on, Spot. Here, boy.

48:20.966 --> 48:21.963
(HUFFS)

48:32.520 --> 48:34.181
Do you see all this, Howard?

48:34.313 --> 48:36.188
Yes. It's very beautiful.

48:36.524 --> 48:37.723
Yes, it is.

48:38.108 --> 48:42.024
And yet it's merely a painful reflection
of R'lyeh's former glory.

48:42.279 --> 48:43.823
- R'lyeh?
- My kingdom.

48:43.948 --> 48:45.028
Yes.

48:45.157 --> 48:48.907
You see, it was not always
this place of ice and desolation.

48:49.036 --> 48:50.864
That's like something Spot said.

48:51.413 --> 48:54.332
He said the snow's been around
for a long time.

48:54.834 --> 48:57.123
"A long time." Yes.

48:57.461 --> 48:59.254
That is an understatement.

48:59.630 --> 49:01.090
HOWARD: But I don't understand.

49:01.590 --> 49:02.872
If it was nice before,

49:03.425 --> 49:04.541
what happened?

49:05.052 --> 49:09.051
Long ago, R'lyeh was the most
beautiful kingdom under the two suns.

49:09.348 --> 49:11.757
Mere words could not capture its beauty.

49:12.476 --> 49:13.758
<i>It was so good,</i>

49:14.186 --> 49:19.063
<i>the poet Abdul Alhazred said the citizens
forgot there is bad in the world.</i>

49:19.483 --> 49:21.026
<i>Lest we forget.</i>

49:21.652 --> 49:24.524
<i>The people of R'lyeh had created
a cosmic good,</i>

49:24.989 --> 49:27.907
<i>but when the foolish forget
there is darkness in the world,</i>

49:28.534 --> 49:30.658
<i>a cosmic evil can arise.</i>

49:31.662 --> 49:35.281
<i>Ignoring the wise words of Abdul,
the darkness grew.</i>

49:36.125 --> 49:39.874
<i>By the time R'lyeh accepted
there was evil, it was too late.</i>

49:40.880 --> 49:45.092
<i>A water being, an Ancient One,
rose from the depths.</i>

49:46.135 --> 49:47.630
<i>Cthulhu was spawned.</i>

49:48.679 --> 49:52.512
<i>Cthulhu and his hordes,
hidden in green slimy vaults,</i>

49:52.641 --> 49:56.687
<i>sunk the city of R'lyeh,
flooding the once-great kingdom.</i>

49:57.688 --> 50:02.647
<i>R'lyeh became a nightmare corpse-city
built by the vast, loathsome shapes</i>

50:02.776 --> 50:05.446
<i>that seeped down from the dark stars.</i>

50:08.032 --> 50:11.069
<i>The citizens believed
if they could take away the water,</i>

50:11.285 --> 50:13.195
<i>that Cthulhu would lose his power.</i>

50:13.913 --> 50:18.243
<i>In an act of desperation,
the citizens of R'lyeh froze their kingdom.</i>

50:19.126 --> 50:20.954
<i>Cthulhu was gone.</i>

50:22.838 --> 50:27.086
<i>But our beautiful kingdom
had become our frozen prison.</i>

50:28.052 --> 50:30.460
<i>No one knows if this story is true,</i>

50:30.846 --> 50:35.556
<i>but we all agree if there's a way
to end this mind-numbing coldness,</i>

50:35.684 --> 50:37.345
<i>we would do anything.</i>

50:38.103 --> 50:42.102
You see, Howard,
it was not only the land that froze that day.

50:42.441 --> 50:44.482
Time itself came to a halt.

50:45.069 --> 50:48.320
Days have passed, months, even years.

50:48.697 --> 50:50.109
But nothing has changed.

50:50.616 --> 50:52.242
Nothing at all.

50:52.868 --> 50:54.529
Until your father arrived.

50:54.745 --> 50:59.702
He journeyed the entire land, our kingdom
included, writing about his findings.

50:59.834 --> 51:01.958
He rediscovered the powerful runes

51:02.086 --> 51:05.871
the people of R'lyeh used
so long ago to freeze our kingdom.

51:06.423 --> 51:10.802
He wrote, and drew,
these lost secrets into three books.

51:11.303 --> 51:13.712
One of the books, we believe the second book,

51:14.140 --> 51:17.426
was stolen from your father
by an Elder Thing.

51:17.643 --> 51:21.227
It has been deep underground
with his Shoggoth ever since.

51:21.814 --> 51:23.013
What's a Shoggoth?

51:23.524 --> 51:26.230
It is a terrible, indescribable thing,

51:26.777 --> 51:30.610
a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles

51:30.739 --> 51:34.821
with myriads of temporary
eyes forming and un-forming.

51:35.578 --> 51:37.488
- Quite nasty.
- Ew.

51:38.247 --> 51:40.620
So, these books that my father wrote...

51:41.083 --> 51:43.373
- What were in them?
- All manner of things.

51:43.711 --> 51:48.753
These books are powerful as they are filled
with secrets, runes and symbols of power.

51:48.966 --> 51:52.003
I believe we can bring our kingdom
back to the way it was

51:52.136 --> 51:54.889
before this frozen nightmare descended on us.

51:55.139 --> 51:58.723
Abdul Alhazred, many call him King Abdul,

51:58.851 --> 52:04.641
prophesied that a stranger from a distant land
would arrive to thaw our frozen kingdom.

52:04.940 --> 52:06.649
When you arrived, I felt...

52:07.234 --> 52:10.355
I felt hope for the first time since...

52:11.113 --> 52:12.906
We cannot reclaim it ourselves,

52:13.032 --> 52:15.738
for we are trapped
inside this frozen kingdom.

52:15.993 --> 52:19.445
And it is the only way
to stop to this never-ending winter.

52:19.830 --> 52:21.207
Bring me the book, Howard.

52:21.332 --> 52:22.827
Do what no one else can.

52:23.459 --> 52:25.867
Do you think it could be used to get me home?

52:26.253 --> 52:30.129
I'm sure it can, after this winter is ended.

52:30.716 --> 52:33.884
I think you've got yourself a deal,
Your Majesty.

52:34.678 --> 52:38.843
To take this book from the Shoggoth,
I'll need to know a lot more about him.

52:39.099 --> 52:41.307
And I have another request.

52:41.644 --> 52:42.676
Do tell.

52:46.774 --> 52:47.771
What?

52:47.900 --> 52:50.818
I said that I'll get the book back
from the Shoggoth.

52:51.612 --> 52:55.693
She said it was the only way to restore
their kingdom and end this long winter.

52:56.033 --> 52:59.818
And it made sense,
since they can't leave until it does.

53:00.246 --> 53:01.361
Too dangerous.

53:01.497 --> 53:04.250
That's why I said
I can only do it on one condition.

53:04.375 --> 53:05.407
What?

53:05.584 --> 53:06.783
That you go with me.

53:06.919 --> 53:09.458
- What?
- Best of all, she said yes.

53:09.839 --> 53:11.298
- No.
- Yes, she did.

53:11.715 --> 53:12.748
Good night.

53:15.553 --> 53:16.549
(HOWARD MOANING)

53:23.352 --> 53:24.384
The book!

53:41.120 --> 53:42.117
(YELLS)

53:47.918 --> 53:48.915
(GASPS)

54:00.806 --> 54:02.088
(GROWLING)

54:03.517 --> 54:04.514
Mmm...

54:07.396 --> 54:08.393
(EXCLAIMS)

54:09.273 --> 54:10.389
Master Howard.

54:10.608 --> 54:12.067
Up, Master Howard.

54:12.610 --> 54:13.690
Must go.

54:14.653 --> 54:16.813
(SIGHS IN RELIEF) It was just a dream.

54:22.328 --> 54:23.527
ALGID: Howard Lovecraft.

54:24.580 --> 54:26.870
May the wind be at your back.

54:26.999 --> 54:31.703
We will hold you in our thoughts until
your triumphant return from the Shoggoth.

54:32.129 --> 54:33.672
Thank you, Your Majesty.

54:34.715 --> 54:36.792
All right, Spot. Come along.

54:38.886 --> 54:39.883
La-di-da!

54:43.516 --> 54:45.390
- La-di-da!
- (SIGHS)

54:46.769 --> 54:48.762
Oh, Spot, there's no need to be angry.

54:48.896 --> 54:50.605
Have to go with Master Howard.

54:50.731 --> 54:52.107
Well, yeah, of course you do.

54:52.233 --> 54:54.475
Angry. Not speaking.

54:54.610 --> 54:56.981
Well, now you're just being childish.

54:57.196 --> 54:58.477
Still not speaking.

55:58.340 --> 56:00.915
This looks like the mountains
we already came from.

56:01.051 --> 56:03.092
No one goes to mountains.

56:03.220 --> 56:04.301
And why's that?

56:04.430 --> 56:05.593
You know legend now.

56:05.723 --> 56:08.179
If book anywhere, it is in mountains.

56:08.434 --> 56:10.593
- How much further, Spot?
- More.

56:11.187 --> 56:13.476
I'm happy you're speaking to me again.

56:13.689 --> 56:15.350
I was beginning to think you...

56:16.192 --> 56:17.438
I think I see the cave!

56:19.236 --> 56:20.400
I think we found it.

56:22.990 --> 56:24.070
What is that?

56:26.285 --> 56:27.531
That must be the Shoggoth.

56:29.705 --> 56:31.746
(SHUDDERS) It's hideous!

56:33.083 --> 56:34.744
What? It is.

56:35.961 --> 56:40.380
All we have to do is sneak in,
grab the book, and sneak out.

56:42.551 --> 56:44.212
(GRUNTING)

56:46.013 --> 56:47.389
Spot, you're not gonna fit.

56:47.807 --> 56:49.088
Cave too small.

56:49.225 --> 56:52.682
HOWARD: You stay here,
I'll get the book and I'll come right back.

56:52.812 --> 56:54.188
We have a deal with the king.

56:54.313 --> 56:55.310
She not king.

56:55.439 --> 56:56.899
Well, who was the last king?

56:57.024 --> 56:58.223
King Abdul.

56:58.359 --> 56:59.439
Very bad.

56:59.902 --> 57:01.148
Abdul the poet?

57:01.362 --> 57:03.272
Abdul many things.

57:03.656 --> 57:06.658
Not poet. Magic, dark.

57:07.701 --> 57:11.370
Well, we have a kingdom to save,
even if the king isn't home right now.

57:12.081 --> 57:16.143
Careful, Master Howard. Cave dangerous.

57:17.545 --> 57:19.289
(GRUMBLING)

57:23.092 --> 57:24.836
Ooh, it smells in here!

57:25.719 --> 57:27.049
What stinks?

57:28.556 --> 57:29.552
Eww.

57:30.558 --> 57:31.638
Ooh, boy!

57:36.188 --> 57:37.731
Eww. (EXCLAIMS)

57:39.233 --> 57:40.645
(SCREAMING)

57:50.161 --> 57:51.157
Yeah! (LAUGHING)

57:51.370 --> 57:52.367
Whoo-hoo!

57:53.497 --> 57:54.494
Yeah!

57:57.459 --> 57:59.500
Whoo-hoo! (CHUCKLES)

58:01.881 --> 58:03.127
La-di-da!

58:03.382 --> 58:04.414
OMINOUS VOICE: Tekeli-li.

58:06.302 --> 58:07.583

58:13.184 --> 58:14.216
OMINOUS VOICE: Tekeli-li. Tekeli-li.

58:18.022 --> 58:19.137
Tekeli-li.

58:22.443 --> 58:23.606
I found it, Spot!

58:23.736 --> 58:24.733
OMINOUS VOICE: Tekeli-li.

58:24.862 --> 58:25.894
That was easy.

58:26.030 --> 58:28.154
Now let's get out of here
before the Shoggoth...

58:28.282 --> 58:29.563
- OMINOUS VOICE: Tekeli-li.
- (GASPS)

58:29.742 --> 58:30.774
Hey!

58:31.994 --> 58:32.991
Hmm.

58:33.329 --> 58:35.618
Who dares disturbs the sleep of Shoggoth?

58:37.791 --> 58:38.788
(GASPS)

58:39.043 --> 58:41.167
Tell me before I crush you.

58:41.754 --> 58:43.035
(STRAINING)

58:46.467 --> 58:47.464
(SHOGGOTH EXCLAIMS)

58:48.093 --> 58:49.340
You dare?

58:52.431 --> 58:53.428
Ah!

58:54.642 --> 58:55.923
Tell me who you are.

58:56.143 --> 58:58.018
You want to know who I am?

58:59.021 --> 59:00.647
I am Howard Lovecraft.

59:02.066 --> 59:03.229
SHOGGOTH: Hmm.

59:03.442 --> 59:04.688
Lovecraft?

59:05.152 --> 59:06.945
This name is known to me.

59:07.071 --> 59:08.103
How?

59:08.239 --> 59:11.075
You are not the first pale young mortal
of that name to venture here.

59:11.909 --> 59:13.238
Then... My father?

59:13.536 --> 59:16.703
Yes, the other one
looked much the same as you...

59:17.164 --> 59:19.288
And he was every bit as curious.

59:19.792 --> 59:21.702
He sought an audience with the Deep One.

59:21.877 --> 59:23.835
His hunger for knowledge had no equal.

59:24.004 --> 59:26.579
Why else would he journey so deep? (CHUCKLES)

59:27.383 --> 59:28.582
What did you tell him?

59:28.801 --> 59:30.213
I gave to him words.

59:30.469 --> 59:31.751
Words of power.

59:31.887 --> 59:34.296
Words that would break down
the walls between worlds.

59:35.474 --> 59:38.809
Words that would burn up his mind,
if he dwelled on them.

59:39.436 --> 59:40.469
But why?

59:40.604 --> 59:45.018
So the fool Lovecraft could spread
my words out among the stars.

59:45.526 --> 59:48.813
Let the walls between worlds
come tumbling down

59:49.196 --> 59:52.198
and let the slumbering Deep Ones rise.

59:54.034 --> 59:57.365
Since you have found your way here,
he must have succeeded.

59:57.746 --> 59:58.743
(CHUCKLES)

59:59.373 --> 01:00:00.405
No.

01:00:00.916 --> 01:00:02.459
What do you mean, "no"?

01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:06.749
We, that is, me and Spot,
we just came here to borrow this book.

01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:07.913
"Spot"?

01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:10.463
Hmm.

01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:15.180
Your Spot...

01:00:15.556 --> 01:00:17.466
- Does he have wings?
- Yes.

01:00:17.725 --> 01:00:20.472
And his face, covered in tentacles?

01:00:20.686 --> 01:00:21.802
Uh, yes.

01:00:21.979 --> 01:00:22.976
(CHUCKLING)

01:00:25.149 --> 01:00:26.395
That is Cthulhu!

01:00:26.525 --> 01:00:29.064
You are calling him Spot?

01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:30.607
(CHUCKLING)

01:00:32.406 --> 01:00:33.818
He is my friend!

01:00:34.408 --> 01:00:36.402
No, he is not your friend.

01:00:36.577 --> 01:00:38.321
He is the Sleeper of R'lyeh.

01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:40.496
He is the destroyer of worlds.

01:00:40.664 --> 01:00:45.293
I have opened the door, but you
woke him up and have brought him through.

01:00:45.503 --> 01:00:46.666
Spot!

01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:57.383
ENVOY: You promised him this will work.

01:00:57.598 --> 01:00:58.678
Yes.

01:00:58.974 --> 01:01:02.012
And you are sure it is this Howard?

01:01:02.228 --> 01:01:05.183
Our fate rests in the hands of one child.

01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:08.308
- The child is not alone.
- (SCOFFS)

01:01:09.193 --> 01:01:10.392
Thu Thu Hmong...

01:01:10.569 --> 01:01:12.397
Or should I say Spot?

01:01:13.405 --> 01:01:14.687
Surely you jest.

01:01:14.949 --> 01:01:16.574
The Great One will awake from his slumber

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.453
and will devour Howard
the first chance he gets.

01:01:19.995 --> 01:01:22.997
But for now, the Great One is helping him.

01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:24.578
That is the plan.

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.910
Centuries have passed in this icy prison.

01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:29.999
No one has been able to cross
the barrier between worlds.

01:01:30.256 --> 01:01:32.000
Until he came.

01:01:32.383 --> 01:01:38.505
Azathoth will be pleased, if Howard
Lovecraft is actually the key.

01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:40.846
Howard needs to bring back the balance.

01:01:41.308 --> 01:01:45.177
I can feel the balance wants to be brought
back in all of its glory as well.

01:01:45.813 --> 01:01:48.352
Our kingdom will be restored

01:01:48.482 --> 01:01:51.647
through the crawling chaos, but the boy

01:01:51.777 --> 01:01:54.150
will not live to see it.

01:01:56.323 --> 01:01:57.320
Hmm?

01:01:59.368 --> 01:02:00.484
HOWARD: Spot!

01:02:01.495 --> 01:02:02.715
Master Howard?

01:02:02.746 --> 01:02:03.910
HOWARD: Help me!

01:02:05.749 --> 01:02:06.746
(GRUNTING)

01:02:10.254 --> 01:02:12.711
I gave your father the key to open the door.

01:02:12.882 --> 01:02:16.832
You turned that key
and released the cosmic evil.

01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:20.256
The Elder Ones are free,
led by the Great Old One,

01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:21.505
Cthulhu!

01:02:22.558 --> 01:02:23.970
Your Spot!

01:02:24.351 --> 01:02:25.348
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.395
Your role in history is complete.

01:02:29.106 --> 01:02:31.859
I want to savour this moment,
Howard Lovecraft.

01:02:32.526 --> 01:02:35.196
And I shall savour it after I gobble you up

01:02:35.571 --> 01:02:39.822
and slowly digest you over 1,000 years.

01:02:40.534 --> 01:02:42.824
Master Howard!

01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:47.994
(ROARING)

01:02:59.637 --> 01:03:00.966
Put him down.

01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:02.671
Now!

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.171
Thank heavens!

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:06.091

01:03:06.268 --> 01:03:07.265
(ROARING)

01:03:15.945 --> 01:03:17.060
No!

01:03:17.321 --> 01:03:18.437
Spot, no!

01:03:19.073 --> 01:03:20.449
You ate my friend!

01:03:20.908 --> 01:03:22.949
No. He is no friend.

01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:25.320
I have not stopped the Great Old One.

01:03:25.454 --> 01:03:26.784
He is too powerful.

01:03:26.914 --> 01:03:31.043
When the Sleeper finally does awake,
then Cthulhu will eat you himself.

01:03:31.502 --> 01:03:33.626
Cthulhu is the destroyer of worlds!

01:03:33.796 --> 01:03:34.912
You're wrong!

01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:37.998
Spot is not a monster, he's my friend.

01:03:38.259 --> 01:03:39.339
Enough of this!

01:03:39.468 --> 01:03:40.750
I have delayed long enough.

01:03:40.886 --> 01:03:42.761
You are no one, Howard Lovecraft.

01:03:43.097 --> 01:03:46.052
And you have nothing,
nothing in this world to save you.

01:03:48.686 --> 01:03:50.395
Argh! The Elder sign!

01:03:51.397 --> 01:03:52.394
No!

01:03:58.612 --> 01:03:59.645
Spot!

01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:02.488
Spot! Oh, thank heavens you're all right!

(GRUNTS)

01:04:03.993 --> 01:04:06.033

Yes. All right.

01:04:22.052 --> 01:04:23.049
Hmm.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:27.468
I can feel the warmth already.

- Question, Master Howard.
- What's that, Spot?

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.030
I was worried it eat you.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.441
Well, it didn't.

01:04:47.828 --> 01:04:49.656
Thank you. You saved me.

01:04:49.955 --> 01:04:52.661
Next time, though, we might not be so lucky.

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:54.619
- "Lucky"?
- Yeah!

01:04:54.752 --> 01:04:59.376
I showed this horrible monster that thing
in my pocket, and he froze in fear.

01:04:59.965 --> 01:05:01.710
- Thing?
- This!

01:05:01.967 --> 01:05:02.964

01:05:03.552 --> 01:05:04.549

01:05:06.138 --> 01:05:07.254
What is it, Spot?

01:05:07.389 --> 01:05:09.182
- What happened?
- Elder sign.

01:05:09.892 --> 01:05:13.227
Here, in R'lyeh, words have power.

01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:15.561
Symbols more power.

01:05:15.856 --> 01:05:18.479
Elder sign greatest power.

01:05:18.943 --> 01:05:20.058
It's just a necklace.

01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:22.188
- Where find?
- It was given to me.

01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:23.781
Powerful gift.

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.736
They care for you.

01:05:25.866 --> 01:05:27.065
Wow!

01:05:27.243 --> 01:05:29.485
Elder sign is great power.

01:05:29.787 --> 01:05:30.819
Careful.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.073
Book also has power.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:35.499
Make Algid return you home.

01:05:35.751 --> 01:05:37.875
You don't think she would just let me go?

01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:39.036
Maybe.

01:05:39.171 --> 01:05:40.797
Promises in R'lyeh are weak.

01:05:40.923 --> 01:05:42.549
What? But you just saved me.

01:05:42.675 --> 01:05:43.755
Why did you...

01:05:43.884 --> 01:05:46.839
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm very glad you did.

01:05:47.096 --> 01:05:48.342
We play in snow.

01:05:48.556 --> 01:05:50.134
Make men of snow.

01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:53.185
We are friends. Friends not eat each other.

01:05:53.435 --> 01:05:55.429
Yeah, we're on the same page there.

01:05:55.563 --> 01:05:57.307
Unless they get very hungry.

(CHUCKLES) Yes. Good one?

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.401
Yeah.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.623
Can it really be?

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:18.122
No more suffering, my subjects!

01:06:18.878 --> 01:06:20.918
We are finally free!

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:25.795
Oh, this is just the absolute best day!

01:06:26.969 --> 01:06:28.595
Let the kingdom of R'lyeh rejoice!

01:06:29.513 --> 01:06:34.554
Know how I fooled a Lovecraft
from my true identity.

01:06:34.685 --> 01:06:36.595
Let us restore balance.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:40.310

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.363
Stay close, Master Howard.

ALGID: I shall take control.

01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:50.863
I shall no longer be the plaything of fate!

01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:53.366
With this book and this beast

01:06:53.496 --> 01:06:57.079
I shall unite all of the realities as one.

You have to fight them.

We can restore the cosmic good to R'lyeh!

01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:30.881
You allowed me to restore the balance.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.013
But it's not cosmic good I'm restoring.

01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:38.305
I released the evil long ago.

01:08:38.434 --> 01:08:40.059
And they froze everything.

as nothing but a ticket home.

01:08:48.068 --> 01:08:53.526

your simple mind could never hope to grasp.

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:52.210
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:11:55.172 --> 01:11:56.169
(YELLING)

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.801
- (EXHALES)
- Huh?

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:03.962
Nope.

01:12:21.657 --> 01:12:22.654
(ROARING)

01:12:37.339 --> 01:12:39.666
Ah! Get the book!

01:12:55.733 --> 01:12:59.269
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:13:04.867 --> 01:13:06.031
That's my room!

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.324
That's my home!

01:13:08.287 --> 01:13:10.577
Run, Master Howard.

01:13:10.998 --> 01:13:12.742
- Go!
- No!

01:13:13.292 --> 01:13:15.036
I'm not leaving any of you!

01:13:19.924 --> 01:13:21.170
Davik!

01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:24.130
Stay away from him.

01:13:26.972 --> 01:13:27.969
Oh!

01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:29.797
(GRUNTING)

01:13:32.269 --> 01:13:34.429
Tell me, Howard, are you afraid of the dark?

01:13:35.564 --> 01:13:38.139
Because my darkness has no fear of you.

01:13:38.442 --> 01:13:40.602
In fact, I think it wants you to join it.

01:13:40.778 --> 01:13:42.190
(GRUNTING)

01:13:43.239 --> 01:13:46.573
Just close your eyes and slip into its abyss.

01:13:49.745 --> 01:13:51.953
Howard, go to your home before it's too late.

01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:57.670
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:14:09.014 --> 01:14:10.759
The Elder sign! Put it away!

01:14:11.392 --> 01:14:12.591
Give me that!

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.570
No, whoa!

01:14:23.654 --> 01:14:24.651
(YELLS)

01:14:26.365 --> 01:14:27.741
Get back to the shadows.

01:14:27.992 --> 01:14:29.024
Get back!

01:14:30.619 --> 01:14:31.949
No, Spot!

01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:45.213
(YELLS)

01:14:47.928 --> 01:14:49.756
You cannot defeat me with that.

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:56.433
"That is not dead which can eternal lie
and with strange aeons even death may die."

01:14:56.645 --> 01:14:57.726
Give me that.

01:15:04.236 --> 01:15:06.360
Your father tried to recreate <i>Al Azif,</i>

01:15:06.864 --> 01:15:09.949
but the Necronomicon
he created isn't even close.

01:15:10.284 --> 01:15:13.535
His feeble attempt
at writing a version made him mad.

01:15:16.582 --> 01:15:18.243
This is not my final form!

01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:19.705
I shall return!

01:15:19.835 --> 01:15:21.710
And you'll never see me coming!

01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:24.246
This is not a victory for you, Howard!

01:15:24.673 --> 01:15:28.589
This is only a delay of the inevitable!

01:15:38.646 --> 01:15:40.307
Spot, are you okay?

01:15:41.273 --> 01:15:42.899
Please tell me you're not hurt.

01:15:43.067 --> 01:15:44.064
(GROANING)

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.112
(PANTING) I am...

01:15:49.532 --> 01:15:50.564
Spot.

01:15:51.742 --> 01:15:54.365
The people of R'lyeh
will know of Algid's deception

01:15:54.829 --> 01:15:57.498
and she will no longer have
any power over them.

01:16:02.586 --> 01:16:04.247
I don't want to leave you guys.

01:16:04.713 --> 01:16:05.913
We've won.

01:16:06.173 --> 01:16:08.416
- Time to go.
- You... You squid kids!

01:16:09.343 --> 01:16:10.625
I love you guys.

01:16:11.387 --> 01:16:14.508
You have a great family.
Always stick together.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.922
Take care of each other.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.266
Howard, when you learn more about
the writings in the book, you can come back.

01:16:20.729 --> 01:16:22.688
For now, you have to go.

01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:26.601
Bye, Howard. I ate your dinner.

01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:29.023
I'll miss you, Howard.

01:16:31.615 --> 01:16:33.276
Thank you, Thu Thu Hmong.

01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:34.905
Not Spot?

01:16:35.035 --> 01:16:37.492
Thu Thu Hmong, Spot,

01:16:37.621 --> 01:16:40.160
I will never forget you.

01:16:40.332 --> 01:16:42.575
I will never forget you, Master Howard.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.241
I will try to come back.

01:16:45.212 --> 01:16:46.494
I will miss you all.

01:17:09.278 --> 01:17:10.275
(GRUNTS)

01:17:21.457 --> 01:17:22.489
Mother!

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.541
Are you sure about this, Howard?

01:17:29.673 --> 01:17:31.418
I want to give him this gift.

01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:39.057
Well, while I am a doctor,

01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:44.688
I also am fascinated with the relationship
between medicine and the occult.

01:17:44.814 --> 01:17:47.899
Your father claims he went to a strange land,

01:17:48.025 --> 01:17:49.568
and we know he came back...

01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:50.899
Different.

01:17:51.028 --> 01:17:53.734
He has told me his stories.
They are maddening.

01:17:53.864 --> 01:17:55.988
So imaginative, yet so clear.

01:17:56.492 --> 01:17:58.651
The most merciful thing in the world

01:17:59.119 --> 01:18:03.035
is the inability of a human mind
to correlate all its contents.

01:18:05.835 --> 01:18:07.034
Hello, Father.

01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:09.834
- Howard!
- I have something for you.

01:18:16.637 --> 01:18:17.966
You did it! Ha!

01:18:18.097 --> 01:18:19.722
You did it, my boy!

01:18:19.974 --> 01:18:22.300
You closed the portal to R'lyeh!

01:18:22.476 --> 01:18:23.473
(LAUGHING HAPPILY)

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.598
I hope you can rest now, Father.

01:18:26.772 --> 01:18:29.810
My evil deed is undone.

01:18:30.234 --> 01:18:31.813
Thank you, my boy.

01:18:32.027 --> 01:18:33.060
Thank you!

01:18:33.195 --> 01:18:34.738
Now I can get better.

01:18:36.866 --> 01:18:38.029
I love you, Father.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:44.077
Your father's mind
had seen too much, you see.

01:18:44.707 --> 01:18:50.002
His journey to the kingdom of madness
took him to the edge of these endless waters.

01:18:50.588 --> 01:18:51.703
Be careful, Howard.

01:18:51.964 --> 01:18:56.045
You have helped your father,
you have helped him a great deal,

01:18:56.177 --> 01:18:57.636
and he will now be able to get better.

01:18:58.179 --> 01:19:02.557
But I fear your journey has just begun.

01:19:09.815 --> 01:19:10.847
Good night, my sweet.

01:19:10.983 --> 01:19:12.015
Good night, Mother.

01:19:12.193 --> 01:19:13.308
Sweet dreams, Howard.

01:19:13.611 --> 01:19:15.854
They will be, Mother. They will be.

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.211
I will learn your secrets.

01:19:38.677 --> 01:19:40.505
No matter how long it takes me.

01:19:41.096 --> 01:19:44.467
I will see my friends
and I will go back to R'lyeh.

01:19:45.017 --> 01:19:47.936
