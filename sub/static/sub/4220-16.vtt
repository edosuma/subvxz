WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.294
What's the matter,
Welch? You lost?

00:03.379 --> 00:05.838
Looks like I'll be
working here at
51 for a while.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.674
Beth? How'd you know
where to find me?

00:07.758 --> 00:09.217
I'm here meeting
my ex-husband.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.844
But you should let
your lieutenant know,

00:11.929 --> 00:14.222
that he can't be
making out with
the Chief's ex

00:14.306 --> 00:15.640
or Pridgen will
destroy him.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.184
Help me keep an eye
on Lieutenant Casey.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.352
That's not how
we do things here.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.687
I'll make it
worth your while.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.783
I apologize for
keeping you waiting.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.992
Not a problem.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.369
What all have you
been told?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.163
Um, just that
it was urgent

00:39.248 --> 00:41.708
and I needed
to come in person.

00:41.792 --> 00:42.792
Well,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.753
you were
contacted because

00:45.838 --> 00:47.463
we've suffered
a security glitch.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.966
Some of the clinic's
confidential records

00:50.050 --> 00:51.092
have been compromised.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.636
And this affects me
how exactly?

00:54.138 --> 00:56.139
We're contacting
every sperm donor

00:56.223 --> 00:58.224
whose DNA
has resulted
in conception

00:59.143 --> 01:00.643
to let them know
that their identity

01:00.728 --> 01:01.978
may have become public.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.441
I'm sorry. Uh, rewind.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.320
You're suggesting
my DNA may have
possibly resulted in...

01:12.239 --> 01:13.239
A child?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.408
Well, that part's
not in question.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.994
What I'm saying is

01:18.245 --> 01:21.497
it's possible the child
may know that his

01:21.915 --> 01:24.500
or her biological
father is...

01:25.002 --> 01:27.211
Donor 1128,
and that...

01:28.005 --> 01:29.547
That's you,
Mr. McHolland.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.433
How do you want to
split it up, Casey?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.477
What's that, Chief?

01:42.853 --> 01:44.103
The alimony payments.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.315
Or were you just
hot-bunking her
out the door?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.609
Chief, I can...

01:57.326 --> 01:58.326
Hey!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.329
You need to mind
your own damn business.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.790
Hey, I'm not
the one sleeping
with the Chief's ex.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.042
I let it go
when you ran your
mouth off to Dawson.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.418
But now Pridgen?

02:08.378 --> 02:10.046
You looking to get
knocked on your ass, Welch?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.048
Okay, the way I heard it,
Beth got liquored-up

02:12.132 --> 02:13.299
and blabbed to her
sister-in-law.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.383
Either way,

02:15.385 --> 02:18.554
I got a ringside seat
to watching your career
go down the toilet.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.945
Guess who I ran into
at my new Zumba class?

02:34.613 --> 02:37.240
Is it cheer
or cringe worthy?

02:38.075 --> 02:39.075
Phil.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.285
Phil...

02:41.578 --> 02:42.578
From Chicago Med...

02:43.163 --> 02:44.664
You know,
with the killer
blue eyes?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.499
Oh! The hot guy
in admin?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.750
Yes.
Ooh, and...

02:48.043 --> 02:50.753
And I asked him
out on a date...

02:52.881 --> 02:53.881
With you.

02:54.758 --> 02:55.758
What?

02:56.093 --> 02:58.261
I don't... I don't
even know the guy.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.470
Oh, that's why
it's a double date.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.681
You know, you and Phil.
Me and Cruz.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.058
Sylvie, I don't know
about this. Seriously.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.518
This is what
friends are for...

03:06.144 --> 03:08.229
To nudge you when you're
getting cold feet.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.439
Come on. It's going
to be awesome.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
Okay.

03:17.948 --> 03:18.948
Yes.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.951
I thought these things
were supposed to be

03:22.035 --> 03:23.286
completely anonymous?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.037
Which is why
I checked the box

03:25.122 --> 03:26.539
marked "confidential."

03:26.623 --> 03:28.082
There's no secrets.
Not anymore.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.208
Not on the Internet.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.626
So, how old
is this kid?

03:30.961 --> 03:31.919
I'm not sure.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.004
Hmm, well.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.839
Is it a boy or girl?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.048
I don't know.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.717
Wait, you didn't
ask at the clinic?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.677
No. Because I don't
want to know.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.430
Hey, uh, Mouch,
you got a phone call.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.724
Who is it?
I don't know

03:44.808 --> 03:46.100
but it's the second time
the guy's called.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.393
So, go pick it up.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.448
Hello?

04:01.533 --> 04:02.658
My what?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.452
Oh, my car.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.746
Oh, thank God.
I mean, thank you.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.414
Uh, no, yeah,
I'll, uh...

04:08.498 --> 04:09.749
Just pick it up
after shift.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.250
I appreciate it, Maury.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.755
Truck 81, Squad 3...

04:17.257 --> 04:19.300
Structure Fire.
Washington and Kedzie.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.397
Go, go, go!

04:34.191 --> 04:35.316
I'm the building manager,

04:36.068 --> 04:37.610
we got a kid missing.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.861
On the third floor.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.822
The other tenants
are accounted for?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.032
Yes, sir.
All of them.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.034
Mouch,
Cruz, south entrance.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.577
Herrmann, Dawson,
grab irons,

04:46.662 --> 04:48.704
we'll take the north.
You all need any help?

04:48.914 --> 04:49.914
No, stand down.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.379
My uncle, he fell
down the stairs!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.297
His leg's hurt real bad!
Can you help him?

04:58.382 --> 04:59.382
Where is he?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.716
He's down the block.
Real close... Here.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.304
Casey!
Chief?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.306
Truck 81 is
being redeployed.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.892
Grab your EMS gear
and accompany this
young woman down the block.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.143
Chief,

05:11.228 --> 05:12.979
we got a kid
trapped inside
a burning building!

05:13.313 --> 05:14.772
Did it sound like
I was asking?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.401
Truck 64 is two minutes
out. Move it!

05:24.032 --> 05:25.199
Clear how that works,
Lieutenant?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.910
Red rag the bull
and you get gored.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.829
Yes, sir.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.580
Yeah, get in there
and find that kid.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.374
Let's go.
Out of the way.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.418
Step back!

05:35.877 --> 05:36.961
Come on.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.630
Capp,
you're with me.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.382
Tony, Welch, Take
the east side, let's go.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.550
- Right.
- Got it.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.263
Fire Department, call out.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.852
Help!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.270
Hey! Hold up.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.479
You hear that?

05:55.564 --> 05:56.605
Help me!

05:56.857 --> 05:57.857
In there!

06:00.402 --> 06:01.485
Please, help!

06:08.285 --> 06:09.827
Look out!

06:18.587 --> 06:19.712
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.130
We can't go
through there.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.049
We got to find
another way in.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.341
Capp.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.010
We'll go through
the neighbor's apartment.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.225
Hey, Capp! This way!

06:36.146 --> 06:38.147
Okay. Enter
through here.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.066
We'll punch through
the back wall.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.150
Okay.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.534
All right, Capp.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.006
- Call out!
- Help!

07:10.055 --> 07:11.764
Where are you?
Call out!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.015
Help me.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.561
Hey!

07:19.022 --> 07:21.107
You lock the door?
Mmm-hmm.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.775
Good job! Let's get you
out of here.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.529
Severide!

07:26.696 --> 07:27.905
Get out of there now!

07:35.872 --> 07:36.956
Severide?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.208
You good?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.877
Yeah.
Let's go.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.719
Hey.
No visible burns.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.054
But she sucked in
a lot of smoke.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.889
We'll bag her en route.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.266
You're going to be
just fine.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.809
We're taking you to
the hospital, okay?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.227
All right, let's go.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.401
Look, I don't know
what Welch

08:05.485 --> 08:07.153
told you about
Pridgen's ex, but...

08:07.237 --> 08:09.321
You should've
heard it from me.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.073
It's a firehouse,
Lieutenant. People talk.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.659
And we both agreed
to take some time.
Which means that we can...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.412
See other
people, right?

08:18.582 --> 08:19.707
I'm glad you're
okay with it.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.126
We're both grown-ups.

08:22.711 --> 08:23.752
Don't sweat it.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.340
So?
Sprained ankle.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.675
The guy refused
treatment.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.843
Where do you want us?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.511
Fire's under control.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.929
Return to quarters.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.933
Hey! We got this,
tough guy.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.394
Help!

08:40.478 --> 08:41.604
Oh, my God.

08:47.903 --> 08:48.903
Herrmann!

08:48.987 --> 08:50.362
Hey, truck 81.
We're gonna need a...

08:50.447 --> 08:52.698
A second ambo at
Kedzie and Washington.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.866
Copy that, 81.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.075
Truck and ambo en route.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.660
The kid...

08:56.745 --> 08:58.621
I went back in
looking for her.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.997
Shh, try
to save your energy.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.041
I got trapped in.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.459
Ambo's a block out.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.793
He's going into shock.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.462
Hey, sir... Hey!
Stay with me.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.671
Stay with me.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.548
Look at me.
Look at me.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.675
C-collar him.
Yeah, got it.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.388
- Stay with me.
- Dawson.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.848
What have we
got here?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.683
Fell from the third
floor window.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.393
He's got a bilateral
femur fracture,

09:21.478 --> 09:23.187
possible head and
spinal injury.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.397
Yeah, we got it.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.815
77 to Main.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.275
We're leaving
Washington and Kedzie

09:28.360 --> 09:29.985
with a trauma victim,
inbound for Chicago Med.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.154
Copy that, 77.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.322
I thought you
were napping.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.406
That makes two of us.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
I found this
under the couch.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.992
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.705
Now, this is going back on
the second that I leave.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.915
I know you,
Wallace Boden.
No.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.793
"Can't turn back
the clock, Wallace.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.837
"Baby's only little
for a short while."

09:50.674 --> 09:52.132
Your father
said that to you?
Yeah.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.677
That man never took
any time off

09:54.761 --> 09:55.844
until he passed.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.430
It ain't going
to be me, Donna.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.182
Not with this little man.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.476
Is that okay? Ooh!

10:03.061 --> 10:04.103
Hey, hey!

10:04.938 --> 10:06.438
Well, this little man
needs to nurse.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.107
So, I will
trade you.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.737
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. Oh.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.366
Tomorrow night.
Mmm-hmm.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.201
You and me.
Mmm-hmm.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.995
Double date.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.121
Absolutely, who with?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.206
Dawson and Phil

10:24.416 --> 10:25.624
from Chicago Med.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.042
Wait, what? Are you
out of your mind?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.502
No, why?

10:28.586 --> 10:31.130
Casey's my boss.
And he and Dawson
just broke up.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.881
Exactly,
key words being
"broke up."

10:33.008 --> 10:34.508
No. way. Uh-uh.
Forget it.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.719
Dawson really
needs this, Joe.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.178
And I promised her.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.974
And the wheels
are already in motion.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.143
What did you do?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.811
Look. If you want
to give Casey the heads up

10:45.895 --> 10:47.896
as like a courtesy
or whatever, go ahead.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.148
But we are going.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.357
Hmm.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.405
Can I have
a word, Chief?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.407
Sure you can.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.118
Hell, we're
practically family.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.543
I had no idea
who she was.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.669
All right?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.463
If I had, it never
would have happened.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.465
Regardless, it's over.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.175
You have my word.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.635
The main thing is

11:18.720 --> 11:20.512
I don't want this getting
in the way of the job.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.514
For either one of us.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.850
Hmm.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.603
Well, I... I can't speak
for you, Lieutenant.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.646
But I'm...
I'm a professional.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.774
Chief...
So, I can assure you

11:32.067 --> 11:34.109
it won't affect how
I conduct my affairs.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.945
If you'll pardon
the expression.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.200
Anything else?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.035
Yeah.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.537
Welch.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.872
What about him?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.249
If he keeps getting
in my face, we're
going to have a problem.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.795
If you've got a beef
with Tommy Welch

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
take it out behind
the backstop and settle it
like a man.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.592
Or float to another house.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.552
I already told you,
he's not going anywhere.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.637
Dismissed.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.565
He's a man.
I'm a man.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.817
He'll get it,
right?

12:14.901 --> 12:15.901
Of course.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.906
I mean, it's just a date
with his ex, right?

12:20.990 --> 12:21.990
Totally.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.034
All right, man,
you got this.
No, hey, no...

12:24.119 --> 12:25.744
Uh, hey, Lieutenant.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.329
What is it?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.665
Know what? Never mind

12:38.007 --> 12:40.008
Hey! Chief Tiberg.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.385
Lieutenant Severide.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.012
The Battalion Chief,
he in?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.682
Uh, he just stepped out
to the app floor

12:46.766 --> 12:47.975
a few minutes ago.
What's up?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.102
Squad 3 was
on the fire call

12:50.186 --> 12:51.728
at Washington and
Kedzie, correct?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.148
Yes, sir. We...
We pulled out
a young girl.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.858
Uh, Sarah...
Thompkins.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.025
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.569
Looks like she's
going to make it.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.822
You saw the building
manager, as well?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.115
Yeah, um...

13:03.199 --> 13:04.366
He was there
when we arrived.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.784
And we all saw
the aftermath.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.870
I didn't witness
the actual fall.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.331
You're aware he's in
critical condition?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.918
No, sir, I...
I wasn't.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.629
Well, his sister's
an attorney.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.631
And now Firehouse 51

13:19.716 --> 13:21.425
is under investigation
for negligence.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.930
Uh.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.812
Joel, what
do you say?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.189
Chief Pridgen.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.608
Something other than
a social call, I gather.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.985
We're looking into
the apartment fire
on Washington.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.404
Whether the building
manager was injured
due to negligence.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.655
Let me stop you
right there...

13:43.740 --> 13:45.240
CFD's concern, Pat,

13:45.700 --> 13:47.075
is that the fire got
short-staffed

13:47.160 --> 13:48.619
when Truck 81
was redeployed.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.330
And that this tactical error,
if that's what it was,

13:51.414 --> 13:52.539
is what led
to the injury.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.958
You're asking me
why I made the call?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.376
That's correct.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.171
Well, based on
the information at hand,

13:59.255 --> 14:01.465
I believed
the EMS run to be
a heart attack victim.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.634
In the moment,
I made a...

14:04.093 --> 14:06.428
Split-second decision
to save the man's life.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.388
Let's take it to
my office, shall we?

14:15.146 --> 14:17.731
Well, it turned out
to be something
less critical, obviously.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.233
But I didn't know
that going in.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.317
I see.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.693
The question I have

14:21.778 --> 14:23.612
from a tactical
perspective is

14:23.947 --> 14:25.739
what took Casey
so long to realize

14:25.823 --> 14:27.533
it wasn't a life
threatening emergency?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.245
What's the answer?

14:31.579 --> 14:34.289
I can't
speculate what's in
another man's head, Chief.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.500
I trust my lieutenants
to handle their business.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.420
Now, if you're asking me
whether it was an error
in his judgment,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.589
well, that's for
you to decide.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.552
Any further questions
for Lieutenant Severide?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.013
No. Carry on,
Lieutenant.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.357
Well, they can't possibly
blame Truck 81.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.441
We didn't do
anything wrong.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.651
We weren't
even there.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.903
Exactly. If we were,

15:04.988 --> 15:07.573
maybe we could have prevented
the guy from going back in.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.700
Or dragged him out before
he got all jammed up.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.160
Every single one of us
would have rather been
in that building.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.205
You know that,
Dawson, and so do I.
But do they?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.915
It's not like
they can fault Casey.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.001
He was just following
a direct order from
Chief Pridgen.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
This is exactly
the kind of thing

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
we have union reps for.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.005
Right, Mouch?

15:23.506 --> 15:24.840
Mary, Mother of God.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.550
What?

15:32.140 --> 15:35.017
Uh, hey,
I know this probably
comes as a shock.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.393
My name's
Emmett Byrd.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.772
I looked into it.
And I think you
may be my dad.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.110
Anyway if you're willing
to sit down with me,

15:45.194 --> 15:47.613
I'll be at the Golden Apple
on Friday at noon.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.116
I'll be standing out
front in a beanie and
a Blackhawks jersey.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.204
Well, at least he's
a Blackhawks fan.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.540
Otis!
This is a catastrophe.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.876
I say you go meet him.
What do you got to lose?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.879
No good can come
from this, Herrmann. None.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.339
Why not?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.424
Seriously, Mouch,
he's your kid.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.634
It could be
really cool.

16:09.886 --> 16:10.886
In fact,

16:12.722 --> 16:14.556
Message has been deleted.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.224
Problem solved.

16:18.895 --> 16:19.895
Wow.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.360
I didn't hear you knock.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.611
I didn't.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.326
We have a problem,
Lieutenant?

16:35.370 --> 16:36.703
I heard what you
told Tiberg.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.581
And?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.583
You knew that wasn't
a life-threatening call.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.379
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.839
I was there, Chief.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.636
It was a tactical decision
to save a man's life.

16:52.929 --> 16:53.929
Full stop.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.694
I can't do it.

17:09.904 --> 17:10.904
You know what?
Don't sweat it.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.281
If it's awkward with
Casey or whatever.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.449
Really?
Yeah.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.576
Yeah. I'll just take
Otis instead.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.996
What?
As a friend.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.456
Look, you're not taking Otis.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.500
I was friends with him
before I was friends with you.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.502
Forget it.
Oh, he doesn't mind.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.337
Will you go
with me, Otis?
Sure.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.588
Otis!

17:29.090 --> 17:30.090
As a friend.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.967
Joe, this is not
about you.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.969
Or me...
It's for Dawson.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.305
So, either you

17:38.766 --> 17:40.016
suck it up...
Okay.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.894
Fine. I'll do it.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.406
Yeah.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.825
Hey, Lieutenant.
Can I ask you a question?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.326
What's up?

17:58.661 --> 18:00.454
How would you feel

18:00.538 --> 18:03.039
about Brett and me
going on a double date?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.667
Why would I care?
With Dawson.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.502
And somebody else.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.926
You know what?
I can tell that this is
not the right time. So...

18:18.055 --> 18:19.181
It's the perfect time.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.142
Go right ahead.
Tear up the town.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.061
You sure?
I'm her Lieutenant.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.480
That's all.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.274
Okay, thanks.
Oh, and, uh... Cruz.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.859
Don't run this
by me again.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.781
Heads up,
I'm not coming in next shift.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.741
- I've got a meeting.
- What meeting?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.202
Test with, uh...
Medical Section.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.954
To see if
I re-qualify for Squad.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.582
So, you're going to
what, just...

18:46.209 --> 18:48.210
Quit the ambo and
drop me as a partner?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.504
If I'm approved?
Honestly, yeah.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.006
Wow. Harsh.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.136
Hey, clear out, guys.
Paramedics coming through.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.805
Clear way.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.139
Hey! Over here.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.224
Right here.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.065
Stand back,
please. Thank you.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.192
Stay calm, buddy.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.736
Paramedics are here.
We're going to be okay.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.196
We're gonna be fine!

19:19.033 --> 19:20.909
Daddy.
Dad!

19:21.786 --> 19:23.161
Is my dad
going to die?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.163
My name's Peter.
This is Sylvie, okay.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.790
What's your name,
buddy?
AJ.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.000
AJ, we're going to
take care of your dad,
okay. I promise.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.961
Just be strong.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.712
And do what they say,
boy. Okay?

19:32.797 --> 19:33.797
Okay.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.715
Ear is clear of
spinal fluid.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.008
We're gonna have to
secure that skate

19:37.093 --> 19:38.468
before we can
transport him to Trauma.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.555
AJ, I need you
to stay perfectly still

19:41.639 --> 19:42.973
while we take off
this boot.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.558
Can you do that?
I don't know.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.725
You can do it, boy.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.686
Okay.

19:51.774 --> 19:52.899
Doing great,
kiddo.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.734
Stay still, AJ.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.114
All right.
Nice and easy, AJ.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.699
I want you to pull
your foot out on three.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.368
One, two, three.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.542
Ah.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.793
- Okay.
- Foot's clear.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.211
- All right.
- Good job, son.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.797
Hey, you! Go grab me some
towels as fast as you can.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.258
Now go help that
security guard.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.176
- Uh. Okay.
- Go with him, AJ.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.930
Am I going to die?

20:24.640 --> 20:25.765
I don't want to die.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.350
Please, my kid...

20:27.435 --> 20:29.060
Hey, hey, buddy.
You're doing great.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.270
Okay? Just
stay strong.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.521
You sure I'm
gonna make it?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.315
Absolutely.
Please.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.191
Oh, my God.
Please!

20:37.153 --> 20:38.695
Okay. Right here.
Thanks, buddy.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.244
It's gonna be okay.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.621
Easy.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.750
Gonna be fine, boy.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.210
We're just
gonna roll you up
on your side, all right?

20:54.545 --> 20:55.921
All right, you,
grab his feet.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.213
Um, hey!
Come over here.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.257
Grab his chest, we're gonna
roll him up. All right.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.383
- Okay.
- On three.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.218
One, two, three.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.345
- Oh!
- All right.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.013
I need you to go
get that stretcher.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.151
Dad!

21:18.569 --> 21:19.861
You can
ride with us, AJ.

21:27.828 --> 21:28.828
Welch.

21:29.956 --> 21:30.956
You know,

21:31.499 --> 21:32.624
you're the only
other person

21:32.708 --> 21:34.709
who heard that girl
tell Pridgen about
her uncle.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.503
Hell, where
I come from

21:36.587 --> 21:38.838
people who make
statements against
their battalion chiefs

21:38.923 --> 21:40.590
don't last long
in the CFD, Lieutenant.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.425
Here at 51,
we tell it like it is.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.052
Yeah, well,
you don't know Pridgen.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.679
I know he's throwing
Casey under the bus

21:45.763 --> 21:47.180
to cover up a mistake
that he made.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.476
Look, even if I were
to put myself on the line,

21:51.560 --> 21:53.311
it sure as hell wouldn't
be for your buddy.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.439
This idiot
pissed him off,

21:56.524 --> 21:57.649
he can pay the price.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.609
Say it again, Welch.
Easy.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.613
Pridgen is going to
bury your ass, man.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.252
Donna, Lieutenant Casey
is on his...

22:17.503 --> 22:19.129
Oh. Shh.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.131
Sorry.
It's okay.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.551
Okay.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.678
Okay.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.349
I'm telling you, Chief,
I know what kind of guy

22:31.434 --> 22:32.726
Welch is, and he's
goading me into it.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.311
And when I drop him,
he's going to take
half my pension.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.730
Then don't let him
push your buttons.

22:36.814 --> 22:37.856
You know how this works.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.190
You got to
go through Pridgen.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.776
Pridgen's got it
in for me.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.528
Then maybe
you shouldn't have
slept with his ex.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.033
I thought you were
on furlough.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.242
I know everything.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.202
Nothing would make
Pridgen happier

22:51.287 --> 22:52.454
than for me
to crack Welch.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.289
That way, everyone forgets

22:54.373 --> 22:56.082
he almost killed my guys
in the truck crash,

22:56.167 --> 22:57.625
and I come off
as the bad guy.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.627
It's just a couple more
months, Casey, come on.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.129
I'm not going to
make it till then.

23:01.255 --> 23:03.214
Either he's going to have
a broken neck or I am.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.467
So, if I have to
float to another house,

23:06.218 --> 23:07.218
that's what I'll do.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.679
Look, please just
keep your cool.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.806
I'll make some
calls. Okay?

23:14.143 --> 23:15.268
Thanks, Chief.
Yeah.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.020
Wallace!
Yeah, I'm coming.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.493
Send him in.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.620
Chief Tiberg
can see you now.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.790
Thanks.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.507
- No way.
- I'm telling you.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.008
You are out of your mind.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.177
Dawson, will you please
settle this for us?

23:49.512 --> 23:51.012
I'm...
So sorry I'm late.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.680
Hey.
Hey.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.682
Um. Sorry.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.561
Phil.
Joe Cruz.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.606
Don't let me interrupt.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.608
Oh, Dawson, actually,
was just about to, uh,

24:03.692 --> 24:05.110
settle an important
argument for us.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.236
About what?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.780
Who sees
the crazier action,
truck or ambo?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.156
She's the only one
who's seen both.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.241
Oh.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.119
Let's just say
for starters that

24:14.203 --> 24:16.037
no one calls 911
when they do
something smart.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.872
Amen.
So true.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.457
There are more calls
in ambo

24:19.542 --> 24:20.834
and you definitely
see more whackos.

24:20.918 --> 24:21.960
Told you.
Mmm-mmm.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.461
I'm going to Mills
for a second opinion.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.588
But in terms of
straight-up intensity?

24:26.757 --> 24:28.800
Nothing beats
the feeling

24:28.884 --> 24:30.301
of rushing into
a burning building.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.803
Or bailing off
of a rooftop

24:31.887 --> 24:33.179
that's about to collapse.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.265
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, girl.
Yeah.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.350
What about you, Phil?
What's your scoop?

24:38.060 --> 24:39.060
Uh, me?

24:39.520 --> 24:40.562
I work in admin.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.397
It's mostly data entry.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.149
That's cool.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.610
I did fix this massive
typo once,

24:48.279 --> 24:49.279
so...

24:53.742 --> 24:54.742
I'm kidding.

24:54.869 --> 24:55.994
Oh.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.505
This Pridgen, he's a real
piece of work, Chief.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.175
I'll tell you about it
over a beer.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.051
I will gladly get you
a cold one, Herrmann.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.803
But I'm gonna pass
on the shop talk.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.263
Are you kidding me?

25:15.472 --> 25:16.681
"Constant updates."

25:16.765 --> 25:18.183
Those were your
exact words.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.143
I've already had
an earful from Casey.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.146
Besides, I'm trying to unplug
from the job for a while

25:23.230 --> 25:24.606
like my pop suggested,
you know?

25:24.732 --> 25:26.774
Support Donna.
Spend some time
with my boy.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.610
Mmm-hmm. How's your boy?

25:29.111 --> 25:31.738
Wallace.
Yes, ma'am.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.323
You mind giving
a listen at his door,

25:33.449 --> 25:34.949
make sure
the baby's down?
Glad to.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.621
How you holding,
Mom?

25:40.956 --> 25:42.290
That little kid
wearing you out?

25:42.625 --> 25:43.625
No.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.460
But he is.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.338
Wallace?

25:48.464 --> 25:49.464
Yeah.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.090
What's going on?

25:51.175 --> 25:53.009
Well, Lord knows
I love the man.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.386
And I appreciate his
enthusiasm for fatherhood...

25:55.471 --> 25:57.722
But he's really putting
his shoulder into it,
isn't he?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.224
He needs to
get back to work.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.475
Seriously.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.394
I think it'll be
better for everyone.

26:06.857 --> 26:07.857
All right.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.198
Lieutenant.

26:19.954 --> 26:23.998
Had, uh, dinner with, uh,
Chief Tiberg last night.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.124
Is that right?

26:25.209 --> 26:27.085
Yeah, kids do, uh,
Tae kwon do together.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.338
He said... Said you
came to see him.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.173
I did. Yeah.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.678
Told him what happened
at the apartment fire.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.348
Yeah, well,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.352
the fact that your statement
conflicts with mine is a...

26:45.104 --> 26:46.312
A major problem.

26:47.898 --> 26:51.067
Especially given that
there's a civilian
in critical condition.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.196
You know, uh,

26:55.698 --> 26:58.032
promotion exams
are next month.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.035
I mean, you'd make
a hell of a captain.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.080
I'm happy
where I am. Thanks.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.419
Hmm. So, you won't consider
amending your statement?

27:09.795 --> 27:10.962
I said what happened.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.887
You come at me,

27:21.056 --> 27:22.598
you'd better not miss,
Severide.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.685
'Cause you could
make captain

27:27.062 --> 27:28.646
or be stripped
of your rank.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.125
Gentlemen.
Don't get up.

27:52.046 --> 27:54.714
There is nothing
to see here.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.178
Is... Is that...

28:00.262 --> 28:03.014
Cheese Danish from
Dinkel's. And no!

28:03.098 --> 28:04.891
No, they are
not for you.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.488
Okay, come on.
We got to talk.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.450
Come on.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.375
I get
the first pick.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.918
You always
get the crust!

28:38.133 --> 28:41.427
There are a handful
of defining moments
in a man's life, Randall.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.763
This is one of them.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.932
I thought we
discussed this.
We did.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.475
But I just can't
sit back

28:47.559 --> 28:49.602
and watch the plane
crash into the mountain.

28:51.897 --> 28:52.897
Okay.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.192
Emmett's going to love you
for who you are.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.152
And if not,
the hell with him.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.530
But never to find out?

29:00.989 --> 29:03.366
You don't want
to lay awake
at night wondering...

29:05.953 --> 29:08.413
I...
I don't know how
to explain this, Trudy.

29:10.874 --> 29:14.168
But me at
the firehouse works.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.421
It makes sense.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.464
On a call,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.717
I know what to do
and what not to do.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.097
But when
I leave 51,

29:28.016 --> 29:31.018
things haven't always
gone my way. Okay?

29:33.981 --> 29:35.857
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.192
And I thank God for it
every day.

29:39.653 --> 29:42.238
I just don't want to
lift this garden stone.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.324
I'll be better off.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.453
And whether the kid
knows it or not,

29:49.705 --> 29:50.830
he will too.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.418
Okay.

29:57.671 --> 29:58.671
Okay?

29:59.590 --> 30:02.008
You have
all of 51.
You have me.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.345
You might have had a son
that loved you, Randall.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.308
But you'll never know.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.403
Wait.

30:27.910 --> 30:28.910
I'll go meet him.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.517
Hey, Chief.

30:52.726 --> 30:53.768
Hey. Have a seat.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.317
What's up?

31:01.693 --> 31:04.612
CFD's inquiry into
this apartment fire

31:04.696 --> 31:06.489
is now a full-blown
investigation.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.824
Thanks to
Lieutenant Severide,

31:09.117 --> 31:10.409
this thing's gone nuclear.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.746
Uh, what's this?

31:14.456 --> 31:16.791
Your sworn statement
that Lieutenant Casey

31:17.042 --> 31:18.876
and Truck 81
were redeployed

31:18.961 --> 31:21.295
because we believed it was
a life-threatening emergency.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.841
All you have to do is sign.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.940
Truck 81,
Squad 3,

31:41.024 --> 31:43.484
Ambulance 61.
Hit and run.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.418
Yeah.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.836
Apparently the car fled

32:01.920 --> 32:03.671
after barreling
down the sidewalk.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.048
Our guys are trying
to figure out
what the hell happened.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.217
How many injured?
At least a dozen.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.261
Scattered over a block.
Maybe more.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.013
We'll work our way
down the block.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.222
You leap frog.
Yeah. Copy that.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.890
Ma'am, are you
all right?

32:14.975 --> 32:16.142
I'll call for
an EMS Plan One.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.060
I'm gonna
start triaging.
All right.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.439
You all right, kid?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, easy.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.648
Whoa, what's up, buddy?

32:22.733 --> 32:23.774
Easy now, easy.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.484
What kind of damn fool
drives a car

32:25.569 --> 32:26.819
down the middle
of a sidewalk?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.696
I'm going to
patch you up, okay?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.451
Here he comes again!

32:36.038 --> 32:37.121
Easy now. Easy.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.289
Come on. Hey,
where are you going?

32:38.874 --> 32:40.333
Come on,
take it easy. Just...

32:40.626 --> 32:41.792
She's going to
check you up.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.210
Come on, kid, easy!
Easy!

33:23.418 --> 33:24.418
Yeah.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.295
Okay. Bye.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.255
Tiberg?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.632
The main thing
he wanted to know

33:29.716 --> 33:30.841
was what the girl
told Pridgen.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.593
I had to tell him
I didn't hear it.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.388
Why not just question
the girl directly?

33:35.472 --> 33:36.597
They can't find her.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.350
The uncle refused treatment
so there's no paperwork.

33:40.602 --> 33:41.936
So, it's my word
against Pridgen's.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.271
Yeah.
Great.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.441
And the only other
person there was...

33:48.777 --> 33:50.569
Walking into
Pridgen's office.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.036
Once this all
shakes out,

33:59.121 --> 34:00.621
Squad 3's going to
need a new Lieutenant.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.753
You know, everyone here
at 51

34:07.921 --> 34:10.297
has treated me
with respect, Chief.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.176
And?

34:15.429 --> 34:17.263
I just want to
get along in this house.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.479
You don't sign this, Welch,

34:27.315 --> 34:28.566
there is no house.

34:30.652 --> 34:31.861
I brought you in here.

34:32.696 --> 34:33.988
And I can
bounce you out.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.515
Hey, then bounce me out.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.143
Because I'm not
lying for you.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.858
Then get your gear
and get out.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.634
Thanks.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.303
Yeah, well I was
a firefighter

35:39.387 --> 35:41.180
before Pat Pridgen
became Chief.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.474
And I'll be one
after he's gone.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.243
Emmett?

36:03.078 --> 36:04.411
Hi, I'm Randy McHoll...

36:05.080 --> 36:06.914
McHolland...
Randy McHolland.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.375
Emmett?

36:11.086 --> 36:12.920
I'm your biological f...

36:15.090 --> 36:16.131
Biological.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.302
Emmett?

36:20.679 --> 36:21.929
Hey, it's great
to meet you.

36:22.722 --> 36:23.931
Thanks for reaching out.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.951
Okay, I admit it,

37:26.328 --> 37:28.162
the double-date idea...

37:29.164 --> 37:30.414
Total bust.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.665
You think?

37:32.125 --> 37:34.001
The important thing
is that you're
getting back out there.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.963
I say we finish these

37:38.340 --> 37:39.340
and go...

37:40.759 --> 37:42.092
Anywhere besides
Molly's.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.637
Because the perfect guy
is out there somewhere.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.639
Let's go hunt him down.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.349
You know, the, um...

37:49.517 --> 37:50.851
The truth is, I just...

37:51.019 --> 37:52.686
I just don't feel
ready for all this.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.438
Come on.
It's Ladies Night
at like,

37:54.522 --> 37:56.023
half the bars
in Chicago.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.693
You know what
I really need, Sylvie?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.320
What?

38:02.155 --> 38:03.155
A friend.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.122
You got one.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.673
This one you're going to
want to hear. Trust me.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.925
I just got off the phone with
Deputy District Chief Tiberg.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.971
All right. You first.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.683
Welch gave a statement
supporting Severide.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.186
Pridgen has been
relieved of his command.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.815
Oh, Chief,
that is fantastic.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.441
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But here's the thing.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.069
I haven't told Donna yet.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.113
I don't even know
how to tell her

38:44.197 --> 38:45.447
because she's come
to rely on me.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.241
You know
what I'm saying?
Wallace.

38:47.867 --> 38:48.993
Uh, suggestions?

38:49.077 --> 38:50.494
Eh...
Come on!

38:50.578 --> 38:53.205
Okay. Just tell her
that your family at
51 needs you.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.791
I mean, I bet you
she'll understand that.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.167
Okay. Okay.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.252
Hey.
Hey.

38:59.713 --> 39:00.713
How is my baby boy?

39:00.797 --> 39:01.797
Sound asleep.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.257
Christopher.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.800
Hey, Donna.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.220
Is everything okay?

39:08.304 --> 39:09.304
Um...

39:10.015 --> 39:11.473
There's no easy way
to say this.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.767
My replacement Chief
at 51,

39:15.061 --> 39:16.437
he's been ordered
to step down.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.732
You're going back to work.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.114
Well, I hate for you to go,
you know that.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.033
I know.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.493
But if they need you...
They do.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.872
Then I understand.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.167
You do?
Yeah.

39:39.669 --> 39:40.836
Oh, God.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.130
Thank you.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.758
Okay. I'm going
to step out

39:45.842 --> 39:47.217
and make a quick
phone call.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.803
...not kidding.
That's good.

39:52.974 --> 39:53.974
No double-date tonight?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.225
Nope.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.065
Hey, how'd it go?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.566
Uh, good. Great.
Nice guy.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.817
Just wanted to meet me,
you know?

40:06.654 --> 40:08.989
I told you it was going
to be okay, sweetheart.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.115
You were right.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.867
Uh, scotch?

40:12.660 --> 40:13.869
All right.
Thanks, Herrmann.

40:14.913 --> 40:15.913
Ugh.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.292
Truck 81

40:20.668 --> 40:22.252
has been cleared
of all wrongdoing.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.671
Chief Boden will be back
at 51 next shift.

40:24.756 --> 40:25.964
- No way!
- Yeah. Huh.

40:26.216 --> 40:28.175
What about Pridgen?
Gone for good.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.593
- Mmm.
- Yeah!

40:31.596 --> 40:33.013
Drinks on the house,
everyone!

40:36.184 --> 40:37.267
Yeah.
