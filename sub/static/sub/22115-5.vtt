00:02.603 --> 00:04.105
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.506
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.109
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.311
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.645
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.679 --> 00:13.381
or to tear us apart.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.582
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.615 --> 00:16.550
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.584 --> 00:18.652
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.686 --> 00:20.654
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.590
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.592
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.625 --> 00:26.494
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.527 --> 00:28.262
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.296 --> 00:30.331
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.333
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.366 --> 00:34.602
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.635 --> 00:37.505
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.538 --> 00:40.608
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.641 --> 00:43.177
you.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.146
Let's get to work.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.414
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:46.447 --> 00:48.616
AllSourcer just named

00:48.649 --> 00:51.185
Nell DeGraf as their new CEO.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.388
I understand you're having
some cash flow issues.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.291
You knew that Mia wanted to keep
this private. I told you that.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.294
I did not post anything
about Grand Pines on Sophe.

01:00.328 --> 01:06.167
As of today, I promise
complete transparency.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.701
I'm putting everything
that I have

01:07.735 --> 01:10.571
about my daughter on Sophe.

01:10.604 --> 01:14.175
Tell them I might know
who killed Mia Tanner.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.144
You should've just kept your
mouth shut about that girl.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.711
Carlos Ochoa was
attacked in prison.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.214
He was stabbed.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.252
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

01:24.285 --> 01:26.620
WOMAN:
His vitals have stabilized,
which is a good sign,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.190
but neurological functions
may have been compromised,

01:29.223 --> 01:31.559
and the longer he's unconscious,
the worse his chances get.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.128
I'm sorry.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.663
I wish I could
tell you more.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.166
Thank you.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.100
Thank you, Doctor.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.172
Damn it.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.475
We even know who did this?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.277
No.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.480
TANNER:
It's my fault.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.648
Sophe put a target
on his back.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.550
No.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.220
When you walk into prison, you
have a target on your back.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.589
Tanner, I know
you don't like hearing this,

02:01.622 --> 02:05.226
but some things
are out of your control.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.760
You're right.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.463
I don't like hearing that.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.339
Leaving already?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.208
Dude, I have a date.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.210
You should try it
sometime.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.578
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
That app's a waste of time.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.680
Anything that brings me closer
to Ann the lawyer

02:26.714 --> 02:28.482
is not a waste of my time.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.750
Ann the lawyer?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.552
If she's a lawyer,
I'm an astronaut.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.387
You guys will have
nothing common.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.689
We both swiped right.
We have that in common.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.458
That matching
function's based on

02:37.491 --> 02:38.592
a one-dimensional
hotness score.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.461
Here we go.
It can't capture

02:40.494 --> 02:42.530
the multidimensional
complexity of attractiveness...
Mm.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.765
...or take into account your
personal preference vector.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.400
So there's really
no reason to think

02:46.434 --> 02:47.668
she'll like
anything about you.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.404
Other than my rugged good looks.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.273
I'm just saying,
the algorithms

02:52.306 --> 02:54.408
are outdated and
kind of shallow.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.377
Shallow. That works for me.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.778
Enjoy your monitor.
All right.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.447
Adios.
Adios.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.781
Big man.

03:00.814 --> 03:01.815
Bring it in, son.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.251
Cool, cool, cool.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.824
(knocks)
Got a minute?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.726
Why even knock?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.528
(clears throat)

03:14.562 --> 03:16.764
Sara, you remember our
general counsel, Greg Stavros?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.567
(sighs)
What's this about?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.435
Nell DeGraf sent

03:21.469 --> 03:23.637
a cease and desist,
claiming Sophe's running code

03:23.671 --> 03:25.406
stolen from AllSourcer.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.840
Well, that's ridiculous.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.311
We carved out
all the code necessary

03:30.344 --> 03:32.646
to run Sophe when we left.
Yes.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.615
But that was a rudimentary
version of Sophe.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.318
You're building new capabilities
all the time, writing new code

03:37.351 --> 03:38.352
to run them.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.853
Yeah, Nell's saying the
new code was developed

03:39.887 --> 03:41.322
while you were
still at AllSourcer.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.623
I would never...

03:42.656 --> 03:44.292
Do you review
all of your team's work

03:44.325 --> 03:45.426
before it goes live?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.328
God, no.
That would be impossible.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.631
I hire good people,
and I trust them

03:50.664 --> 03:53.301
to do their job.
So, theoretically,

03:53.334 --> 03:55.669
one of your engineers
could have used code

03:55.703 --> 03:57.671
from AllSourcer
without your knowledge?

03:57.705 --> 04:00.408
MIKE:
Okay.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.610
Greg and his team need
access to all of our code,

04:02.643 --> 04:05.346
and they're gonna need to
do a side-by-side audit

04:05.379 --> 04:08.416
to see if any
of this sticks.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.318
What'll happen
if they're right?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.320
Best-case scenario?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.887
You'll have to shut it down

04:13.921 --> 04:15.856
until you can rebuild
using clean code.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.458
And if we can't...

04:17.491 --> 04:20.594
rebuild using clean code?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.330
Then AllSourcer's got

04:22.363 --> 04:25.466
a claim to ownership of Sophe.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.341
(phone ringing)

04:33.374 --> 04:36.577
They're saying we stole I.P.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.746
What?! Well, did we?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.348
No.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.616
I don't know.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.818
I might have screwed up,
Jeffrey.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.520
I'm so sorry.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.389
(sighs) All right, listen.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.823
Don't worry about it.
We'll figure it out.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.625
Can you just get back here,
please?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.860
I'm on my way.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.497
DISPATCHER:
Attention, all officers.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.500
We have a 187
at 1026 Northridge.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.702
All units
and frequencies stand by.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.437
Victim is Derek Walsh.

05:03.471 --> 05:07.341
Repeat: 187 victim is
retired officer Derek Walsh.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.779
This is one-X-ray-17,
responding code three.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.382
Sorry.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.816
We got to make a stop first.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.586
(siren wailing)

05:18.619 --> 05:21.455
(urgent chatter)

05:21.489 --> 05:22.723
(siren wailing)

05:26.894 --> 05:28.796
Stay here.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.601
CAVANAUGH:
Hey.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.936
Ruiz, what do you got?

05:35.969 --> 05:39.407
Three shots at close range.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.741
My guess is
the assailant pulled up

05:40.774 --> 05:42.443
next to Derek
at that stop sign.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.446
CAVANAUGH: All right,
so Derek loses consciousness,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.448
and the car crashes here.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.650
(audio distorted)

05:52.853 --> 05:54.354
(echoing):
Hey! Hey!

05:58.426 --> 05:59.927
Hey, sir, I need
you to stay back.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.861
Is that my daughter?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.663
Back up.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.465
Is that my daughter?!
Hey, sir, sir...

06:04.498 --> 06:07.501
Sir, I need you
to step back.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.478
Survives 15 years on the force,
even gets shot on the job,

06:17.511 --> 06:19.580
just to go out like this?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.648
(tires screech)

06:24.552 --> 06:26.654
Shelly. Shelly.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.456
Hey, no. Stand back.
Derek? Derek?

06:28.489 --> 06:29.490
Derek?
Tommy, don't.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.458
SHELLY:
Oh, no.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.892
(crying):
Oh, no. No.

06:31.925 --> 06:32.793
Tommy.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.697
(crying):
No.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.733
You're too
close to this.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.570
Go home. I got it.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.037
Go.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.674
That's an order.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.012
We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna get 'em.
(crying)

06:53.947 --> 06:56.049
Let's go.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.018
(Shelly continues crying)

07:06.827 --> 07:08.796
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

07:17.671 --> 07:19.673
Look, I-I don't mean to pry.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.810
Then don't.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.012
Look, it-it... you...

07:25.045 --> 07:27.981
It seems like
you want this case.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.850
A cop is dead, Tanner.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.052
Nobody wants this case.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.488
You want to figure out
who did it.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.592
Your deputy chief said

07:38.626 --> 07:40.961
she wants the department
to work with Sophe, right?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.964
Yeah, she said that.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.734
Where do we start?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.678
*

08:10.658 --> 08:13.160
RUIZ: Let's just start
with the basics, okay?

08:13.193 --> 08:15.629
How was Derek
handling retirement?

08:17.698 --> 08:21.234
Um... it was tough,
to be honest.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.804
Getting sh-shot
in the line of duty.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.808
No one expects their career
to end that way.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.243
And he wa... he wa...
he was still in pain,

08:30.277 --> 08:31.912
um, still going to therapy

08:31.945 --> 08:34.682
for his hip.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.851
But we...
but we were dealing with it.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.956
(sniffles) I'm sorry.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.792
Shell, it's okay.
It's all right.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.794
No, you can keep going.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.162
So, um, were there any problems

08:49.196 --> 08:52.265
with any family or friends,
anything like that?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.735
Uh, no, nothing like that.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.539
And how were things at home?

09:01.609 --> 09:04.277
I've been married for 15 years.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.313
I-I know it's not easy.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.982
Things were fine.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.853
So, no marital disputes
or money issues, anything?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.855
Seriously?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.658
I know that the wife is
always a suspect, but come on.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.992
I'm just trying to
do my job, Shelly.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.661
I know you would do the same.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.362
Well, then, let's just
cut the crap, okay?

09:22.395 --> 09:25.232
We both know that

09:25.265 --> 09:27.735
things weren't always right
with my marriage.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.704
We went through a rough patch,
we separated.

09:30.738 --> 09:35.275
But when Derek got hurt,
I cut things off with Tommy.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.945
I got transferred to Northern,

09:37.978 --> 09:40.213
Derek and I
went to counseling.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.982
We were working on it.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.622
I haven't talked to Tommy
in two years,

09:48.656 --> 09:50.924
and there hasn't been
any other man since.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.628
But if you want to
do things by the book,

09:54.662 --> 09:56.263
go ahead...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.968
...test my service weapon.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.337
(phone ringing, vibrating)

10:04.371 --> 10:05.906
Where are we at?

10:05.939 --> 10:08.776
We are officially launched
as of three hours ago,

10:08.809 --> 10:09.977
which probably means
the department already knows

10:10.010 --> 10:11.111
you're working this case.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.814
They can take me off the case,
but they can't stop me

10:13.847 --> 10:15.048
from doing my job.
What do you got?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.049
SARA:
Well, we've uploaded

10:16.083 --> 10:17.651
all the case information

10:17.685 --> 10:19.953
and asked users to posit
potential theories

10:19.987 --> 10:21.655
and vote on their likelihood.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.356
"Random act of violence"
is in first position,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.893
followed by "retribution
from someone Derek arrested."

10:25.926 --> 10:27.327
Though the newest theory
gaining momentum

10:27.360 --> 10:29.329
is suggesting that the killer
was a jealous lover.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.865
Jealous-- what?
Hold on, wh-what?

10:31.899 --> 10:33.033
SARA:
Yeah, so, a creative user

10:33.066 --> 10:35.068
managed to access
public records.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.839
Two years ago, Shelly and Derek
were living in separate homes.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.709
Marital problems then
could mean marital problems now.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.712
Yeah, but that theory's
only at eight percent.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.013
CAVANAUGH:
PD's already working

10:46.046 --> 10:47.781
the random act of violence
angle.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.282
They're looking into
Derek's old cases, too.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.951
Could be a connection.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.821
The thing is, going through
all those files could take days.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.056
Days for them.
Sophe works fast.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.358
Analyzing troves of data
is a crowd specialty.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.694
CAVANAUGH:
Whoa, wait a minute.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.296
There's some sensitive
information in those files.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.898
Yeah, but Josh
can run an algorithm

11:04.932 --> 11:06.033
and just redact
anything you want.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.968
We just need those files.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.371
I know a clerk in the file room.
She'll help.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.807
But files were only digitized
the last six years.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.843
The rest you'll have to scan
in person.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
Well, I know just the man
for the job.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.047
All right. I'll get back to you.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.719
(line ringing)

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
(phone ringing, vibrating)

11:27.755 --> 11:29.122
You need something else?

11:29.156 --> 11:31.391
No. I was just, uh...

11:31.424 --> 11:33.126
I was wondering
how you're doing.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.763
How I'm doing?

11:35.796 --> 11:38.031
You know, I...
with-with everything else.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.801
You called back to ask that?

11:40.834 --> 11:43.003
Well... yeah.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.840
I'm fine. Thank you.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.341
And good-bye.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.015
Knock, knock.

11:55.048 --> 11:59.019
(sighs) This is the budget
from the lawyers.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.356
Almost 200,000 lines of code
that need to be audited.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.325
That takes a lot of manpower.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.029
All this could've been avoided.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.163
Please tell me
you're not gonna give me

12:10.197 --> 12:11.231
the "I told you so" speech.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.867
I am gonna give you
the "I told you so" speech.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.903
Because all you had to do
was play nice with Nell.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.771
And give her a stake in Sophe?

12:17.805 --> 12:19.172
No. These users are here

12:19.206 --> 12:20.974
because they want to be

12:21.008 --> 12:22.109
a part of something.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.111
I can't just monetize it.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.979
I know you don't want
to think about it,

12:26.013 --> 12:28.081
but we need
a long-term strategy.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.449
Where are we headed?

12:29.482 --> 12:30.784
What happens after
you catch Mia's killer?

12:30.818 --> 12:31.518
Then what do we do?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.453
We don't have to go
down this road.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.888
Make nice with Nell.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.057
Negotiate now,
and we'll get a better deal.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.392
I can't. I can't do that, Mike.
I'm sorry.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.894
I can't.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.196
There is one more option.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.199
Uh...

12:46.233 --> 12:48.101
AllSourcer
can't take this to court

12:48.135 --> 12:49.536
without the board voting on it.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.104
Alex has a lot of power.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.906
She's the last super voter.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.441
I am in no position

12:54.474 --> 12:56.910
to ask Alex for a favor
right now, Mike.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.445
All right. Okay.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.913
But if Nell wins,

12:59.947 --> 13:02.816
you need to be prepared
for the worst.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.821
NELL: We're in the middle
of negotiating

13:07.855 --> 13:09.957
for an ownership
stake in Sophe.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.492
I can't imagine
that's going very well.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.061
Well, it's already
getting messy,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.496
which is why I'm here.
Now, listen.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.232
I want nothing to do with this,
nor do I want to have

13:19.266 --> 13:21.201
anything to do with Jeffrey--
you know that.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.236
You have the only
super voter shares left.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.840
As long as you hold on to them,
you have a virtual veto power.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.842
But I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

13:28.876 --> 13:29.943
But I can abstain
from voting.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.611
I can.
Yeah, you could, Alex.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.514
But what Jeffrey's tapped
into here, it's the future

13:34.547 --> 13:37.084
of social computing.
It is incredibly valuable.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.585
If we bring Sophe
back to AllSourcer,

13:38.618 --> 13:40.888
your shares
will be worth twice as much.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.255
Nell, this is not about money.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.024
No, of course it's not.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.458
But remember,

13:45.492 --> 13:46.927
if I have a controlling
stake in Sophe,

13:46.960 --> 13:49.129
I have say over how
Jeffrey uses it

13:49.162 --> 13:51.865
and what he can post.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.967
Or is it not about that, either?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.137
So, do I have your support?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.148
That's the rest
of Detective Walsh's case files.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.018
Human trafficking,
illegal gambling,

14:11.051 --> 14:12.552
prostitution...

14:12.585 --> 14:14.154
all my faves.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.455
Appreciate it.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.560
I, uh, I think we have
everything we need, so...

14:20.593 --> 14:21.995
Thank you.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.563
Can I tell you something?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.098
But I haven't told anyone
at work,

14:25.132 --> 14:26.666
so you need to keep it secret.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.169
Okay.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.971
(whispering):
I'm a Sophe user.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.940
DearPrudence95.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.174
Wait, you're DearPrudence95?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.009
You're in our top five percent
of users.

14:36.043 --> 14:36.910
You just got your
platinum star.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.312
Yeah, I was all over Sophe
from the start.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.082
But don't tell that
to anyone here.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.317
They're threatened,
understandably.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.518
Of course.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.320
Hey, is it true that
your distributed DBMS

14:47.354 --> 14:50.590
is built entirely on
open-source tools?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.192
A-Actually, yeah.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.661
It kind of matches
our crowdsourcing philosophy.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.596
Don't want to be a hater, but...

14:56.629 --> 14:58.598
have you considered
a blockchain implementation?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.100
Decentralization
might help

15:00.133 --> 15:02.302
push a lot of the
storage to the cloud.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.337
That's actually
a really good idea.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.273
I'll bring that up
at our next staff meeting.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.009
Whoa, don't sound so surprised.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.011
Women can have good ideas, too.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.213
No. No, no, no, no.
I-I didn't mean it like that.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.082
I'm sorry. Didn't...

15:15.115 --> 15:17.217
God, you Silicon Valley bros
are all alike, aren't you?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.651
No, no. My boss is a woman.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.653
I love women. Women are fan--
my mom's a woman.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.122
(sighs)

15:23.991 --> 15:25.592
You're a little too easy.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.929
You're cute, though.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.100
Uh, thanks.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.141
(siren wailing)

15:46.346 --> 15:48.281
Hey.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.283
Hey.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.654
Look, I'm really
sorry about Derek.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.390
He was a good guy.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.027
Thanks, Tommy.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.998
So, any progress?

16:05.032 --> 16:07.567
Oh, I'm not
working this one.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.139
Fine.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.707
We don't have
anything solid yet.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.144
But I will find out
who did this.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.279
Thank you.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.020
So, h-how you been?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.122
You don't need to ask about me.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.358
You got enough going on.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.693
Wasn't fair.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.029
What I did.
No, Shelly, Shelly, no, no.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.031
I didn't want to leave
things like...

16:38.065 --> 16:40.700
Look, you did what
you had to do, okay?

16:40.733 --> 16:44.437
No, I know
I did, but...

16:44.471 --> 16:47.407
there's some things
we should talk about.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.744
I didn't mean for it...

16:51.778 --> 16:53.146
to hurt you.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.449
Hey.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.185
Hey, um,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.087
Tommy, could you give us
a minute alone, please?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.189
No, no, no, whatever you got,
Tommy can hear it.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.324
I'm gonna tell him anyway.

17:04.357 --> 17:09.396
Okay. Um, did you know
that Derek was on fentanyl?

17:11.231 --> 17:14.367
He had a prescription, you know,
for the pain, for the injury.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.338
But... no, the doctors
weaned him off that last year.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.208
Okay. Well, the M.E.
found it in his system.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.709
And it wasn't from
any prescription.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.478
It was cut with levamisole
and chloroquine.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.813
Street level.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.216
SHELLY:
So, what are you saying?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.184
That Derek was an addict?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.352
No, he wasn't.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.187
I lived with him.
I would know.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.090
Blood work doesn't lie, Shelly.
I'm sorry.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.269
Fentanyl? You think it's
connected to the murders?

17:49.302 --> 17:52.672
In my experience,
when a drug addict is killed,

17:52.705 --> 17:55.275
it's usually because of
the fact he's a drug addict.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.378
Derek had 400 micrograms
in his system, which is a lot.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.647
It must've taken him forever
to build up that tolerance.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.282
(chuckles)
I'm not even gonna ask.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.816
JOSH: All right,
I think we have something.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.286
We uploaded all of Derek's
old case files.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.121
Appropriately redacted,
of course.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.689
But now that I entered
the fentanyl information,

18:09.722 --> 18:13.126
users have honed in on six cases
they think could be related

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
to his murder.
TANNER: I told you.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.829
When you have thousands of
eyes, things move quickly.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.799
So, the six cases they're
focused on are all drug busts.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.169
And they're all involving
prescription painkillers.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.670
JOSH:
And Derek used the same

18:23.703 --> 18:25.305
confidential informant
in each one.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.308
C.I. number 52914.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.442
Looks like he
was a dealer.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.311
SARA: So, the theory is
that his C.I.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.246
might have been his supplier.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.681
Or maybe even his killer.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.848
You know who this C.I. is?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.751
No. But I can find out.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.288
(knocks)

18:42.422 --> 18:43.856
Got a sec?

18:43.890 --> 18:44.857
One.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.359
I got a lead
on Derek's case,

18:46.393 --> 18:48.828
but I need a name
of one of his old C.I.s.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.264
I know it'll take you a minute
to get the request cleared,

18:51.298 --> 18:53.333
and I was hoping we'd get
the ball rolling tonight.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.202
Now, why would
you need that

18:55.235 --> 18:57.437
when you're not even supposed
to be working this case?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.273
Yeah, well, I put
a couple feelers out there.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.874
Yeah, I know you did, on Sophe.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.711
I know you don't want me
on this case.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.279
But I also know that

19:06.313 --> 19:08.315
you want to solve it
as bad as I do.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.783
So why not use
all the resources you have?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.686
Because, Tommy,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.389
having you on this case
is a bad idea.

19:16.423 --> 19:19.426
I saw what it did to you when
Shelly went back to Derek.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.829
I was your partner, remember?

19:22.862 --> 19:25.732
So forgive me if I don't want
to send you back there.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.334
You think staying off this case

19:27.367 --> 19:29.236
is gonna keep me
from thinking about her?

19:29.269 --> 19:32.171
I just don't want to see you
get hurt again.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.944
All right, so, look,
I appreciate it.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.247
But this is not about me.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.714
It's not about Shelly.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.383
It's about Derek.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.919
He was a good cop
and we owe him this.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.488
So let me help.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.891
Please.

19:55.828 --> 20:00.733
* Misty feelings
in a city of sin *

20:00.767 --> 20:03.736
* I've got no money,
just time and thoughts... *

20:03.770 --> 20:07.840
You want to talk about it?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.810
* If you want to waste...

20:10.843 --> 20:13.380
Listen, don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.482
Please don't tell me
to stop worrying, Jeffrey.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.485
There is an entire firm

20:18.518 --> 20:21.454
of lawyers reviewing my code
as we speak.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.490
We might lose Sophe,
and it's my fault.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.891
It's not your fault.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.427
Look, I was a mess
when I left AllSourcer.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.761
I wasn't thinking clearly.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.564
I should've been
more meticulous.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.566
We should've been
more meticulous.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.967
We made Sophe.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.269
Mm-hmm.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.470
I've spent years

20:37.504 --> 20:38.538
working on that platform,

20:39.506 --> 20:40.873
so please stop acting
like it's all yours.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.008
You know that's not
what I meant.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.511
No, I don't, actually,
because sometimes it seems like

20:44.544 --> 20:46.413
you're the only one
with a stake in this.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.480
And you're not.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.881
Do you understand?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.817
* And I'm feeling all right

20:50.850 --> 20:52.419
(phone chimes, vibrates)

20:52.452 --> 20:55.788
* As soon as she comes,
she's out of sight... *

20:55.822 --> 20:57.324
The lawyers have finished
their audit.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.591
Mike's on his way.

20:58.625 --> 21:03.530
* And I'm a sucker
for your bed of charms. *

21:03.563 --> 21:05.332
MIKE:
Our lawyers found

21:05.365 --> 21:09.602
5,123 lines of code
that are identical

21:09.636 --> 21:12.605
or substantially similar
to AllSourcer's code.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.841
It's a side-by-side
comparison.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.610
Oh, my God.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.479
Did you file our response?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.881
Sara needs to
review the audit first.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.983
We need you to
provide proof

21:24.016 --> 21:26.319
that the initial use of the code

21:26.353 --> 21:28.388
did not occur
at AllSourcer.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.424
And what if I can't
provide proof?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.362
Okay.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.029
I'd better get to work.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.030
You need some help?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.966
No, I've got it.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.502
MIKE:
Jeffrey?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.837
This is bad.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.941
I know that you don't want to,
but you have to talk to Alex.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.886
Hey, how you guys doing?
Looking to start a membership?

21:59.919 --> 22:03.623
No. Uh, we're looking for one of
your trainers, Gerard Rigelow.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.024
Me, too, man.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.125
He hasn't been
to work in days.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.460
Actually, you know what?

22:07.494 --> 22:08.928
His girlfriend
might know where he is.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.129
Hey, Nicole!

22:10.162 --> 22:11.364
They're looking for Gerry.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.901
Nicole!
Stop! Police!

22:14.934 --> 22:16.969
Police!

22:23.576 --> 22:24.544
(toilet flushes)

22:27.880 --> 22:29.482
Hey!

22:29.516 --> 22:31.984
(grunting)

22:35.922 --> 22:37.657
This doesn't look
suspicious at all, Nicole.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.661
So the girlfriend
had fentanyl, too?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.696
Yeah. We think she and Gerard
were dealing together.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.665
Well, she have any idea
where he is?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.967
She's not talking,
and no one's seen him

22:48.000 --> 22:49.702
since around the time
of Derek's death.

22:49.736 --> 22:52.605
So he officially promoted
himself to prime suspect.

22:52.639 --> 22:53.706
We'll find him.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.575
We'll put it up on Sophe.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.110
Listen, there's something else
that I want to tell you.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.447
What's that?
After I got off
the phone with you,

23:00.480 --> 23:02.649
I started thinking about
Mia's death and how everyone

23:02.682 --> 23:05.685
was calling me and asking me
if I was okay, and I--

23:05.718 --> 23:08.455
uh, it made me feel awkward
and angry, so I just want

23:08.488 --> 23:09.489
to let you know that
I'm not gonna do that.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.123
You mean again?

23:11.157 --> 23:12.425
Exactly.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.461
I appreciate it.
No problem.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.696
Are you okay?
No, I'm just kidding.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.730
Oh, man.

23:17.764 --> 23:18.998
Talk to you later.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.967
All right.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.705
Are you having a personal life?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.974
Who said it's personal?

23:28.007 --> 23:32.178
So you're just sending lonely
messages out into the void?

23:32.211 --> 23:35.014
Prudence? Oh, God.
It's too easy, isn't it?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.616
I-I actually don't know
where to start.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.451
I'm actually crippled
by decision fatigue.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.919
You're a child.
This must be love.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.155
No, seriously. Where'd you meet
her? Did you change your mind

23:43.189 --> 23:43.990
about the dating apps?
Did I inspire you?

23:45.224 --> 23:46.626
Ann has been amazing, by the
way. We have so much in common.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.060
We met in real life,

23:48.094 --> 23:49.629
if you must know.
IRL?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.531
Yeah.
That's impressive, dude.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.232
Did you ask her out yet?
No, no. It's not like that.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.701
She's just, you know,
interested in Sophe.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.536
I don't even know
if she's single

23:56.569 --> 23:58.170
or if she's into me
or into dudes at all.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.506
TARIQ:
Well, we're gonna find out.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.207
Dude. Do not--
Give it back to me.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.509
Don't. Come on, man.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.243
That's not cool.
Want it back?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.778
Here you go.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.681
You invited her here?

24:08.715 --> 24:10.983
She's gonna be mad impressed.
(evidence alert blaring)

24:11.017 --> 24:13.219
Check it out.
Someone found Gerard's car.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.224
Uh, so when did
the car show up?

24:18.257 --> 24:20.059
Uh, about
three days ago.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.794
You know, they found it
abandoned at some pay lot

24:21.828 --> 24:23.195
in Daly City.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.532
So... hold a sec.
(flies buzzing)

24:25.565 --> 24:28.167
Might want to stand back here.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.775
Go ahead.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.010
(groans)

24:38.044 --> 24:39.245
(flies buzzing)

24:39.278 --> 24:41.213
Oh, man!

24:44.551 --> 24:46.252
That's our guy.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.025
I'm sorry, Alex,
but I need your help.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.928
Let me guess, with Nell.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.530
How did you know?

24:57.564 --> 24:58.931
Well, she beat you
to the punch.

24:58.965 --> 25:02.301
Guess you're losing a step.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.070
She's trying to destroy
everything that I built.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.540
I don't care. You and Nell
have to duke it out.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.642
Okay, fine. We will
figure out a way

25:09.676 --> 25:11.944
to put your shares
in a trust.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.680
They'll still retain
their voter rights.

25:13.713 --> 25:14.681
Jeffrey,

25:14.714 --> 25:16.649
I sold my shares.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.885
What do you mean?

25:18.918 --> 25:20.553
Listen to me.
I'm using the money

25:20.587 --> 25:21.854
to start a foundation
in Mia's name.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.757
You know, the thing about
the super voter rights,

25:24.791 --> 25:28.094
they expire the moment
you transfer them, and...

25:28.127 --> 25:30.529
My voting bloc is gone.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.867
I'm sorry.

25:34.901 --> 25:38.571
So, M.E. puts Gerard Rigelow's
time of death at four days ago.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.106
Two days before
Derek got shot.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.341
So then Gerard's
not the guy.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.978
The thing is
the ballistics also came back.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.581
The .45 used to kill Gerard

25:48.615 --> 25:50.883
is the same gun
that killed Derek.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.785
It's the same killer.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.721
But that doesn't make sense.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.723
I mean, th-there's lots
of reasons

25:56.756 --> 25:58.090
a drug dealer gets killed,

25:58.124 --> 26:00.126
but what does that
have to do with Derek?

26:00.159 --> 26:03.362
What else do you know about
his relationship with Gerard?

26:03.395 --> 26:06.866
I didn't know Gerard existed.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.035
What are you thinking, Tommy?

26:12.171 --> 26:14.741
Look, I hate saying this.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.643
But is there a chance

26:16.676 --> 26:19.011
that Derek and Gerard
were working together?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.881
You, uh, you think
Derek was dealing?

26:21.914 --> 26:23.616
I know, I know.
But Derek spent

26:23.650 --> 26:26.653
a lot of time undercover,
on drug cases.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.954
That changes you.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.122
Throw in the fact
that he was using,

26:30.156 --> 26:32.892
who knows what's possible,
Shelly?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.160
Derek kept things to himself.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.095
It made him great at his job.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.064
Made him not so great
at being a husband.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.632
It's why we separated.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.100
When I went
back to him,

26:41.133 --> 26:43.369
after he got hurt,
I-I thought maybe

26:43.402 --> 26:47.774
that would bring us closer,
but never happened.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.609
Things were as bad
as they ever were.

26:54.413 --> 26:59.151
I gave you up because I thought
I-I was doing the right thing.

26:59.185 --> 27:02.021
And I know I hurt you.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.422
Tommy, I...

27:03.455 --> 27:06.693
I never stopped
thinking about you.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.398
Sorry. Uh...
(clears throat)

27:12.431 --> 27:13.933
I should go.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.101
Talk later?
Mm.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.906
(Cavanaugh sighs)

27:23.910 --> 27:26.946
Nicole.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.749
We know that you're trying
to cover for your boyfriend.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.450
But he's gone now.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.721
CAVANAUGH:
Help us out,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.188
and maybe we talk to the D.A.,

27:36.222 --> 27:38.858
get him to cut you a deal
on the fentanyl charges.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.862
Unless you had
something to do with this.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.964
Who, me?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.733
What do you want to know?

27:46.766 --> 27:48.034
RUIZ: Anything you
can tell us about

27:48.067 --> 27:49.468
Gerard and Derek.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.103
What were they
involved in together?

27:51.137 --> 27:52.839
Together? Nothing.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.240
They weren't in business?

27:54.273 --> 27:56.909
Gerard and Derek?

27:56.943 --> 27:58.978
No. Derek bought from us.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.947
Yeah, he was a client,
but that's all.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.481
RUIZ:
Well, the same person

28:02.514 --> 28:04.016
that killed Derek
also killed Gerard,

28:04.050 --> 28:05.785
so there's got
to be a reason.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.119
What is it?

28:07.153 --> 28:09.889
Look, Gerard didn't come home
Monday night,

28:09.922 --> 28:11.824
and I knew that
something bad happened.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.492
I didn't know
what else to do,

28:13.525 --> 28:16.128
so I asked Derek for help.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.798
What kind of help?

28:18.831 --> 28:21.167
Well, Derek used to be
a cop, right?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.903
I mean, I just thought that
maybe he could find Gerard.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.139
Derek starts investigating...

28:27.173 --> 28:29.275
And whatever he finds
gets him killed.

28:29.308 --> 28:32.078
Gerard was being stupid.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.914
Okay, he started selling
to a lot of new people.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.749
Like people
he didn't know.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.951
And when you do that,
other dealers get angry.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.920
RUIZ: Okay, so you're
talking about a turf war.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.089
So what other dealers
should we be looking at?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.826
Nicole, who is it?

28:46.859 --> 28:49.028
Nicole...

28:49.061 --> 28:51.197
we won't let anything
happen to you.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.033
You... you don't know.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.267
This guy,

28:55.301 --> 28:57.536
he's dangerous.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.205
Like really, really dangerous.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.777
The 5,123
disputed lines of code.

29:04.811 --> 29:05.744
Now...

29:07.213 --> 29:09.782
Close the door, please.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.784
Look at the first 3,056.

29:11.818 --> 29:14.120
Each and every
one of these

29:14.153 --> 29:16.789
is in the public domain.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.257
Then there's
the next 1,411,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.559
which are certainly similar
to AllSourcer's,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.061
but not similar enough

29:22.094 --> 29:23.963
as to cross the copyright
infringement threshold.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.197
MIKE:
Let's hope a judge

29:25.231 --> 29:26.966
agrees with you.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.567
What does that leave,
like, six hundred and...?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.568
Fifty-six.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.238
656 lines of code

29:32.271 --> 29:33.906
which are not in
the public domain,

29:33.940 --> 29:35.074
which are
similar enough

29:35.107 --> 29:36.943
to AllSourcer's
as to be identical

29:36.976 --> 29:40.947
and... that all originated from
my grad work at Stanford.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.852
That is my code, not theirs.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.854
We're in the clear. Right?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.823
I'll-I'll let Stavros know
to stand down.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.860
You should smile more, Mike.
It's good for the digestion.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.896
What is it?

29:56.929 --> 29:58.865
Uh, it's nothing.

29:58.898 --> 29:59.966
Uh, nothing.
We're good.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.800
Good. Nice work, Sara.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.875
Wow.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.143
We okay?

30:14.246 --> 30:16.883
Come here. Please.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.121
Look.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.261
I know that I can be a little
self-involved sometimes.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.597
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.265
It used to be cute.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.400
Mm.
It was never cute.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.969
Ever, ever cute.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.972
When I... when I heard
that we could lose it all,

30:40.006 --> 30:41.874
all I could think about was Mia.

30:41.908 --> 30:45.311
And I know how hard you've
worked, and I'm sorry

30:45.344 --> 30:47.279
that I lost sight of that.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.654
You're forgiven.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.089
(cell phone ringing)

30:59.258 --> 31:00.960
(clears throat)

31:00.993 --> 31:02.661
(phone beeps)

31:02.694 --> 31:04.931
Give me something
good, Detective.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.632
How about a name?

31:06.665 --> 31:09.335
Luis Gregorian.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.037
Yeah, according to
Gerard's girlfriend,

31:11.070 --> 31:13.139
he was looking for Gerard
the day he died.

31:13.172 --> 31:16.642
Threatened one of her friends
to get Gerard's address.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.946
Yeah, I'm-a e-mail you
Gregorian's stats right now.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.148
He's a person of interest
in half a dozen murders.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.050
All drug-related.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.351
They never stick.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.153
All right, we'll
put it up on Sophe.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.921
You read my mind.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.057
I'm getting good at that.
We'll get back to you.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.059
Yeah.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.660
TARIQ: Look, I love
that Detective Cavanaugh--

31:34.693 --> 31:36.162
real handsome dude,
stand-up guy--

31:36.195 --> 31:38.064
but I think he's wrong
about this one.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.365
"Drug turf war"
is on the list,

31:39.398 --> 31:41.367
but it's only
clocking in at 11%.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.434
Fentanyl sells mostly online.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.204
Probably not much fighting
over it on the streets.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.939
So where does
that leave us?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.107
Put up everything you have
on Gregorian.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.241
Maybe that'll
give us some answers.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.178
GREGORIAN: You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

31:52.211 --> 31:55.948
I had nothing
to do with this.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.484
Forgive me if I don't
take you at your word.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.954
You should get to know me.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.156
I'm really an honorable guy.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.192
So, Luis, can we stop
playing games?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.426
I know you threatened an addict

32:07.459 --> 32:11.964
to get Gerard's address,
the day he died.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.400
Wait.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.103
How do you know that?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.371
And then,
a few days later,

32:19.405 --> 32:23.409
Derek Walsh came by
looking for evidence.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.744
Now, he was onto you.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.080
It was only
a matter of time.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.949
So he had to go, too, didn't he?

32:32.218 --> 32:34.320
There's no way out of this, man.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.721
You killed a cop,

32:35.754 --> 32:37.156
retired or not.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.226
No. I did not.

32:40.259 --> 32:44.196
Luis, I got people at your place
right now searching it.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.531
You're gonna sit there

32:45.564 --> 32:47.466
and pretend
they won't find anything?

32:47.499 --> 32:52.538
Listen, man, if you come clean
now, I can help you out of this.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.040
All right?

32:54.073 --> 32:56.008
I'll walk you through it.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.982
(laughing)

33:06.118 --> 33:08.020
You almost had me.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.555
I swear, you-you almost did.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.157
(laughs)

33:11.190 --> 33:13.359
But then I
remembered.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.528
If you actually had
anything solid on me,

33:16.562 --> 33:19.265
you wouldn't be
talking about it.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.167
You'd be showing it.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.369
(laughs)

33:25.304 --> 33:28.174
How about that lawyer, huh?

33:28.207 --> 33:30.042
(laughs)

33:30.076 --> 33:31.443
RUIZ: We searched
Gregorian's house up and down.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.511
It's clean.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.314
Don't tell me
we got to let this fool go.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.582
Well, unless some magical
evidence shows up,

33:36.615 --> 33:37.449
we're not gonna
have a choice.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.152
But we're gonna make a
case, and until then...

33:40.186 --> 33:40.819
(phone ringing, vibrating)

33:40.852 --> 33:43.589
Hold that thought.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.592
Hey. Please tell us
you got something.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.494
This wasn't over
a turf war.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.829
It's all about
a drug overdose.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.164
You're gonna have
to elaborate.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.399
SARA: Okay, so
users created

33:53.432 --> 33:56.468
a sidebar conversation
about fentanyl overdoses,

33:56.502 --> 33:58.570
which are at record levels.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.106
Okay. So?

34:01.207 --> 34:02.208
So, some of our users
thought it might be relevant

34:02.241 --> 34:03.375
to the case.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.411
And when we put in
Gregorian's info,

34:05.444 --> 34:08.280
everything pointed to a guy
named David Kemp,

34:08.314 --> 34:10.416
who is a sophomore
at Cal State East Bay.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.284
Or at least, he used to be.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.286
He's Gregorian's nephew.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.189
He died last week
of a fentanyl overdose.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.225
And according
to the M.E.'s report,

34:19.258 --> 34:22.294
it was cut with a mixture
of levamisole and chloroquine.

34:22.328 --> 34:25.231
Gerard sold Gregorian's nephew
the drug that killed him.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.300
And that, my friend, is motive.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.202
Well, that is great,
and very helpful,

34:30.236 --> 34:31.403
but we're still
gonna need

34:31.437 --> 34:33.105
a little something
called evidence.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.206
Wait a minute.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.507
Maybe not.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.276
We'll call you back.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.221
You still want that
lawyer, right?

34:49.255 --> 34:52.291
Just have a seat.
We'll get you a phone.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.267
The hell my sister doing here?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.502
Just protocol.
You know.

35:03.535 --> 35:07.473
RUIZ:
Must've been so hard for her,

35:07.506 --> 35:08.840
when her son passed away.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.844
CAVANAUGH:
Young man like that,

35:12.878 --> 35:14.780
in the prime of his life.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.216
Had to be hard on everyone
in the family.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.451
I mean, I get it.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.420
A mother wanting revenge?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.554
Eye for an eye.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.190
No.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.392
She's not like that.

35:26.425 --> 35:29.861
But the thing is, if your sister
knew what you were gonna do

35:29.895 --> 35:31.430
and she didn't
say anything,

35:31.463 --> 35:32.831
then that still makes
her an accomplice.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.167
And that is prison time.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.835
(clicks tongue)
Oh.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.505
She's right.
I never thought of that.
RUIZ: Yeah.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.174
Yeah, right. Whatever.

35:42.208 --> 35:45.444
Right. You're close, hmm?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.180
I mean, family's important.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.915
That's why you did what you did.

35:49.948 --> 35:53.819
RUIZ: I'm sure
she appreciates you for that.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.454
And you're a good big brother.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.589
Well, although
a good big brother

35:57.623 --> 36:00.226
wouldn't let his sister
go down for this.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.263
CAVANAUGH:
So let me be clear.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.965
This...

36:06.998 --> 36:09.601
it is a one-time offer, Luis.

36:09.635 --> 36:13.572
Admit what you did,
and we let your sister

36:13.605 --> 36:15.574
go home right now.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.876
Back to her family.

36:17.909 --> 36:21.313
She has
two other kids, right?

36:21.347 --> 36:26.385
Be a shame for them to lose
their brother and their mother.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.954
Come on, Luis.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.195
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.871
CAVANAUGH:
So we got a full confession.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.374
We got him.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.409
Derek had his problems,
but at the end,

36:50.442 --> 36:51.877
he was doing
something decent.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.512
You need to know that.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.315
Thank you.

36:56.348 --> 36:59.585
Look, Shelly, you know, I'm
always here for you, right?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.387
Yeah. I do.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.854
You do?
Yeah.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.657
So am I ever gonna
see you again?

37:05.691 --> 37:08.660
Probably not for a while.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.663
I need some time.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.366
I get that.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.302
(engine starts)

37:20.339 --> 37:22.608
But yeah, you'll see me again.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.576
Take care of yourself.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.848
Bye, Tommy.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.990
*

37:50.469 --> 37:53.372
Don't you have
anywhere else to be?

37:53.405 --> 37:55.006
I just, you know,
wanted to come down...

37:55.040 --> 37:56.442
See if I'm okay. Yeah.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.944
No, no, definitely
not that.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.679
(laughs)

38:00.712 --> 38:02.581
You know what?

38:02.614 --> 38:05.351
I could use a drink.
You want to have a drink?

38:05.384 --> 38:07.453
You want, you want
to get a drink with me?

38:07.486 --> 38:09.421
Well, you're here.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.423
You know a place?

38:11.457 --> 38:12.458
Oh, I know a place.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.059
Really?
Oh, yeah.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.395
You let your hair down?
You don't seem like the type.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.433
So this is The Hive.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.636
Whoa.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.472
Right?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.540
Oh, my God.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.975
(both laugh)

38:30.008 --> 38:31.977
TARIQ: Our little
boy's growing up.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.346
SARA:
They're so cute.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.515
That's it.
I need a closer look.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.053
Games, ping pong.
You know, we got it all.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.757
This place is so cool.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.394
Yeah. Some parts
are better than others.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.695
You must be Prudence.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.463
I am.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.499
And I have no idea
who you must be.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.101
I'm Tariq. Josh must
have raved about me.
Okay.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.103
Weren't you leaving?
I was.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.138
I have a date, too.
Ann. She's super hot.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.073
(purrs, laughs)

39:02.107 --> 39:03.074
But we should do this
again sometime.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.075
How about a double date?

39:04.943 --> 39:06.344
Don't answer that.
Just think about it.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.416
I'm-I'm really sorry
about that.

39:10.449 --> 39:13.118
Look, I-I know this wasn't like
a date date or anything, so...

39:13.151 --> 39:16.555
Oh. Well, that's awkward,
because I thought it was.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.492
You-you did?

39:22.193 --> 39:24.630
You coming?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.965
Y-Yeah. Def-definitely.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.105
Let me guess.

39:34.139 --> 39:37.008
It's not good news.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.444
God, I hate it when I'm right.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.545
Uh, excuse me, everyone.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.447
Can you all just
take five minutes?

39:41.480 --> 39:42.714
Sure.
Thank you.
I need the floor.

39:46.718 --> 39:50.456
When Jeffrey recruited
you from Stanford,

39:50.489 --> 39:52.424
did AllSourcer pay off
your student loans?

39:52.458 --> 39:53.592
Yes.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.561
It was part of my contract.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.196
They also paid
for my final year of tuition,

39:58.229 --> 40:00.198
they gave me facilities
to work at, they...

40:00.231 --> 40:01.567
Exactly.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.134
(sighs)

40:03.168 --> 40:06.572
Which puts this
clause into play.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.773
It's the one that
grants AllSourcer

40:07.806 --> 40:09.675
rights to all
of your work,

40:09.708 --> 40:12.611
if you were being compensated
for it in any way at the time.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.146
Ironically, that clause
was Jeffrey's idea.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.049
I, um, I don't understand.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.853
Are you saying AllSourcer
does actually own the code?

40:21.887 --> 40:25.591
Yes. And the rights to anything
that's a direct result of it.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.858
But that's everything.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.527
That's all of Sophe.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.761
Yes.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.600
They're also saying that
you violated a non-compete.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.135
That's not really valid here in
California, but your contract

40:37.168 --> 40:39.204
specifies Massachusetts law.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.106
Another Jeffrey idea.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.141
Uh, sorry, Mike, I don't
understand what you're saying.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.645
What I'm saying is that it's not
really about the code anymore.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.481
They're coming after you.
At least, what's in your head.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.883
Which is what makes
this whole place run.

40:51.917 --> 40:55.687
They can't force me
to work for AllSourcer.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.556
No.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.658
But they can stop you from
working anywhere else.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.460
Including here.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.497
I'm sorry, Sara.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.232
Yeah.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.675
(rock music playing
over speakers)

41:16.708 --> 41:19.578
I didn't know cop bars
actually existed.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.514
Where else is the team gonna go
after a big game?

41:22.548 --> 41:23.682
Wait a minute,
are you actually saying

41:23.715 --> 41:24.850
that we're on the same team
right now?

41:24.883 --> 41:26.618
Whoa.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.721
What I'm saying is,
you're not that bad.

41:29.755 --> 41:32.758
That's literally the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.526
Good.
(phone ringing, vibrating)

41:34.560 --> 41:36.828
(clears throat)

41:36.862 --> 41:38.597
I got to take this.

41:38.630 --> 41:39.731
All right.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.166
Yeah.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.538
Having that bad
of a day, huh?

41:46.572 --> 41:47.539
Hey.

41:47.573 --> 41:48.640
Um...

41:48.674 --> 41:50.542
Oh, come on.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.744
He's having a drink with me,
not the other way around.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.547
Seriously, are you okay?

41:55.581 --> 41:58.550
Yeah. It is what it is.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.285
All right.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.722
Just checking.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.233
What?

42:15.266 --> 42:17.869
That was Carlos Ochoa's lawyer.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.838
What did he want?

42:19.871 --> 42:23.809
Ochoa left a message
the day that he was stabbed.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.811
Wanted to get in touch with me.

42:25.844 --> 42:28.279
Said that he might know
something after all.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.682
About Mia's murder?
Yeah.

42:30.716 --> 42:34.252
So what if that's why
someone was trying to kill him?

42:35.854 --> 42:38.657
(clears throat) Hear yourself,
Tanner. All right?

42:38.690 --> 42:41.793
You're talking about a cover-up
around your daughter's murder,

42:41.827 --> 42:43.829
that reaches inside
a maximum security prison?

42:43.862 --> 42:45.997
What if there is?
