SARAH: In 1490
the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca...

01:12.990 --> 01:14.991
...landed on shores of the New World...

01:15.159 --> 01:17.076
...seeking power and fortune.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.872
He was immediately attacked
and captured...

01:21.123 --> 01:24.500
...almost all of his
traveling companions murdeted.

01:25.502 --> 01:30.131
Enslaved, de Vaca chose to embrace his
captor's beliefs and learned their ways.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.968
He became a healer.
Over time, he was freed...

his own following...

over life and death.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.286
...is common among experiencers

02:00.454 --> 02:03.748
When a person lives through something
beyond human understanding...

02:03.916 --> 02:08.377
...we experience fear, a loss of control,
a sense of isolation...

02:08.587 --> 02:13.299
...and a deep, almost existential,
loneliness.

A few years after MIT,
I went to work for an aerospace firm.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.146
It was there that I was approached
by a company...

17:44.313 --> 17:46.732

I was driving home from work...
