Daniel:
BACK WHEN WE LIVED IN CAVES,

00:03.254 --> 00:05.466
OUR SURVIVAL OFTEN DEPENDED
ON OUR ABILITY

00:05.466 --> 00:08.049
TO FIGURE OUT FAST WHO WAS
A FRIEND AND WHO WAS FOE.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.590
THE AMYGDALA SERVED

00:09.590 --> 00:11.592
TO MAKE THE SNAP JUDGMENTS
THAT KEPT US ALIVE.

00:11.592 --> 00:13.013
IT'S WHAT'S KNOWN AS
THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.014
[ DOOR OPENS ]

00:23.274 --> 00:24.735
YEAH, HE'S REAL, DOC.
GOOD.

00:24.735 --> 00:27.528
TAKE OVER FOR ME.

00:33.454 --> 00:35.866
SO, HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
OFFICER?

00:35.866 --> 00:37.828
WHAT THE HELL?!
STAY AWAY FROM HER!

00:37.828 --> 00:39.460
WHO?
CAROLINE NEWSOME!

00:39.460 --> 00:41.372
I HAVEN'T -- I HAVEN'T
SEEN CAROLINE IN MONTHS.

WITH ME.

00:45.426 --> 00:48.669
SHE KNOWS IT WAS YOU, ASSHOLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:48.669 --> 00:50.171
YOU SMASHED HER WINDSHIELD.
YOU SCRATCHED

00:50.171 --> 00:51.932
"I WANT YOU BACK"
INTO THE HOOD OF HER CAR!

00:51.932 --> 00:53.224
AT LEAST HAVE THE BALLS
TO ADMIT IT!

00:53.224 --> 00:54.385
LOOK, UNLESS YOU
WANT TO FIND YOURSELF

00:54.385 --> 00:55.806
SLAPPED WITH
A POLICE-BRUTALITY SUIT,

00:55.806 --> 00:57.348
YOU BETTER TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF ME RIGHT NOW.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.559
CONSIDER THIS
A COURTESY CALL.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.481
AND IF I HAVE TO
COME BACK HERE

01:00.481 --> 01:02.313
FOR ANY MORE
OF THIS STALKER CRAP,

01:02.313 --> 01:04.525
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF
WALKING OUT OF YOUR CLASSROOM

01:16.617 --> 01:19.460

01:30.090 --> 01:32.052
IS THIS SOMEONE'S IDEA
OF A JOKE?

01:32.052 --> 01:33.304
DOC, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:33.304 --> 01:34.715

01:34.715 --> 01:36.807
WHO WROTE THIS?!

01:36.807 --> 01:39.350
THAT WAS
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION!

01:39.350 --> 01:40.851
HOW THE HELL DID YOU...?!

01:43.894 --> 01:45.526
WHAT, ARE YOU LISTENING --
TELL ME WHO WROTE THIS,

01:45.526 --> 01:47.358
OR I'LL HAUL ALL OF YOU DOWN
TO THE DEAN'S OFFICE!

01:47.358 --> 01:48.859
I -- THAT IS --
THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE BOARD.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.901
THERE'S NOTHING ON THE BOARD,
OKAY?

01:55.406 --> 01:56.997
YOU'RE HAVING AN EPISODE.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.542
I THINK YOU BETTER
TAKE ME HOME.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.334
OKAY.

02:03.334 --> 02:08.249
UM, YOU GUYS, THAT -- THAT'S
GONNA BE ALL FOR TODAY, OKAY?

02:08.249 --> 02:10.961

STALKING CAROLINE.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.963
OH, COME ON, NATALIE.
NOW WHO'S DELUSIONAL?

02:12.963 --> 02:14.215
YOU WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST SCHIZOPHRENIC

02:14.215 --> 02:16.056
TO OBSESS ABOUT
THEIR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

02:16.056 --> 02:18.259
THINK ABOUT IT, DANIEL --
YOU'RE UN-MEDICATED,

02:18.259 --> 02:19.890
AND YOU NEVER REALLY
DEALT WITH THE BREAK-UP.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.892
SO -- SO, WHAT,
I TOOK A CAB TO HER HOUSE,

02:21.892 --> 02:24.104
SMASHED HER WINDSHIELD,
CARVED A NOTE IN HER PAINT JOB,

02:24.104 --> 02:25.316
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF IT?!

02:25.316 --> 02:26.527
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

02:26.527 --> 02:27.728
MAYBE YOU WERE
IN A FUGUE STATE --

02:29.360 --> 02:30.771

LIKES THESE THINGS.

AND WHO ELSE
WOULD SCRATCH

02:32.193 --> 02:33.614
"I WANT YOU BACK"
INTO HER CAR?

02:33.614 --> 02:35.075
MAYBE IT WAS
SOME OTHER EX-BOYFRIEND.

02:35.075 --> 02:37.278
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
SHE GOES FOR THE CRAZY ONES.

02:37.278 --> 02:38.829
FACE IT, DANIEL.

02:38.829 --> 02:41.242
YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING
YOUR ILLNESS TOO CASUALLY.

MAYBE IT'S FINALLY
CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

THINK THINGS THROUGH.

YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO MAX.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.678

04:24.305 --> 04:27.308

TO TALK, ALL RIGHT?

04:31.191 --> 04:32.653
OKAY.

SO, UH, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

04:36.737 --> 04:39.740

ANONYMOUS GIFTS AND NOTES

04:39.740 --> 04:40.991
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

04:40.991 --> 04:43.574
AT FIRST,
IT SEEMED HARMLESS.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.826
I WAS PRETTY SURE
THEY WERE FROM DANIEL.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.829
WHY DANIEL?
BECAUSE THE PERSON
WHO'S LEAVING THESE THINGS

04:48.829 --> 04:50.831
SEEMS TO KNOW ME
VERY WELL --

04:50.831 --> 04:52.673
MY FAVORITE FLOWERS
AND MUSIC.

04:52.673 --> 04:55.506
BUT THE MAIN REASON IS
THAT ALL THE NOTES

04:55.506 --> 04:58.128
SAID BASICALLY
THE SAME THING --

04:58.128 --> 04:59.920
"I WANT YOU BACK."

04:59.920 --> 05:02.132
YOU THINK DANIEL
WANTS YOU BACK AS A THERAPIST.

05:02.132 --> 05:03.263
NO.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.769
OH, YOU, UH -- YOU AND HE --
WE DATED BRIEFLY.

05:08.769 --> 05:10.771
I KNOW IT WAS
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,

05:10.771 --> 05:12.773
BUT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I THINK IT'S DANIEL,

05:12.773 --> 05:14.895
ESPECIALLY GIVEN
HIS LACK OF STABILITY.

05:14.895 --> 05:17.317
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
DANIEL'S FAR FROM

05:17.317 --> 05:20.531
THE ONLY UNSTABLE PERSON
YOU'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH.

05:20.531 --> 05:22.533
I MEAN,
ANY NUMBER OF YOUR PATIENTS

05:22.533 --> 05:24.705
COULD HAVE DEVELOPED
A CRUSH ON YOU,

05:24.705 --> 05:26.907
GONE ONLINE,
FOUND OUT WHAT YOU LIKE.

05:26.907 --> 05:28.539
I'M A VERY PRIVATE PERSON.

05:28.539 --> 05:30.371
I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK
OR ANY OF THAT.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.793
AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD
KNOW THOSE THINGS ABOUT ME

05:32.793 --> 05:34.625
ARE THE MEN THAT
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.257
AND ASIDE FROM DANIEL
AND THE GUY I'M SEEING NOW,

05:37.257 --> 05:39.009
I HAVEN'T DATED ANYONE
IN YEARS.

05:39.009 --> 05:42.012
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU SEEM PRETTY CONVINCED

05:42.012 --> 05:43.424
THAT IT IS,
IN FACT, DANIEL.

05:43.424 --> 05:45.556
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
JUST TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT?

05:45.556 --> 05:47.968
I'M A SHRINK.
I KNOW STALKERS.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.770
THE BEST APPROACH
IS TO IGNORE THEM.

05:49.770 --> 05:52.603
RIGHT. DON'T ENGAGE,
AND THEY MOVE ON.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.064
RIGHT.

BUT THEN YESTERDAY, SEAN,
MY NEW BOYFRIEND --

05:56.977 --> 05:59.189
HE FOUND
MY WINDSHIELD SMASHED

05:59.189 --> 06:01.071

ON THE HOOD OF MY CAR.

SO YOU CALLED THE COPS.

06:03.534 --> 06:06.366
SEAN PLAYS HOCKEY
WITH A CPD DETECTIVE,

06:06.366 --> 06:08.989
AND HE ASKED HIM TO SPEAK
TO DANIEL OFF THE RECORD.

06:08.989 --> 06:10.831
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET DANIEL
INTO TROUBLE.

06:10.831 --> 06:13.043
I JUST WANTED HIM TO STOP.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.416

IT DIDN'T WORK.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.418

IT'S ESCALATING.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.051

FROM LEAVING GIFTS

06:21.051 --> 06:23.554
TO SMASHING WINDOWS?

06:23.554 --> 06:26.386
SEAN AND I MOVED IN WITH
EACH OTHER A FEW WEEKS AGO.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.349
I THINK THE STALKER
IS LASHING OUT.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.772

06:31.772 --> 06:35.185
THIS DOESN'T QUALIFY
AS AN FBI CASE,

06:35.185 --> 06:37.187
BUT I DO THINK
THAT I CAN HELP YOU.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.399

ANY FINGERPRINTS

06:39.399 --> 06:40.821
ON THE BOX OF CANDY,

06:40.821 --> 06:43.153
OR DNA IF HE LICKED
THE ENVELOPE...

06:43.153 --> 06:44.985
ALL RIGHT,
AND WE BOTH KNOW

06:44.985 --> 06:47.287
WHOSE FINGERPRINTS
THOSE ARE GONNA BE.
OKAY.

06:47.287 --> 06:50.290
I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU,

06:50.290 --> 06:52.122
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
I DON'T THINK

06:52.122 --> 06:53.834
DANIEL'S CAPABLE
OF DOING ANY OF THESE THINGS.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.336
DANIEL HAS
A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE!

06:56.336 --> 06:58.589
HE'S VERY GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS,

06:58.589 --> 07:01.001
EVEN LYING
TO HIDE HIS SYMPTOMS.

07:01.001 --> 07:03.544
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.

07:13.393 --> 07:15.556
SO, WHAT?
SHE STILL THINKS I DID IT?

07:15.556 --> 07:17.107
SHE HAS HER REASONS.

07:17.107 --> 07:18.318
[ SIGHS ]

07:18.318 --> 07:19.770
SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT US,
DIDN'T SHE?

07:19.770 --> 07:21.982
LISTEN, DANIEL,
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

07:21.982 --> 07:23.984
IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

07:23.984 --> 07:26.406
JUST...

07:26.406 --> 07:27.658
TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN STALKING HER.

07:27.658 --> 07:30.240
I HAVEN'T.
GREAT.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.455
SO,
WHAT'S WITH THE LOOK?

07:35.455 --> 07:39.289
THERE'S...
THERE'S LIKE A 1% CHANCE

THAT I'VE BEEN
DOING THESE THINGS,

07:40.921 --> 07:42.042
AND I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:44.044 --> 07:45.676
I'M GONNA RUN
WITH THE 99%.

07:45.676 --> 07:48.048
GOOD.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.263
DOC, WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CLASS.

07:53.263 --> 07:55.055
I'M NOT TEACHING CLASS
TODAY.

07:55.055 --> 07:57.227
ARE YOU HAVING SYMPTOMS
AGAIN?

07:57.227 --> 08:00.861
NO, I'M FINE.
I JUST...

08:00.861 --> 08:03.564
[ SIGHS ]
YESTERDAY WAS HUMILIATING.

08:03.564 --> 08:07.818
LOOK, ALL YOU DID
WAS ERASE A BLANK CHALKBOARD.

08:07.818 --> 08:10.661
BIG DEAL. OKAY?
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU HAVE YOUR...

08:10.661 --> 08:11.912
ECCENTRICITIES.

08:14.164 --> 08:17.788
[ SIGHS ] FINE.
I'LL RESCHEDULE CLASS.

08:17.788 --> 08:22.002
BUT, DOC, DON'T WORRY.
YOUR STUDENTS LOVE YOU.

08:28.298 --> 08:33.724
CHANCELLOR, TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS UNEXPECTED PLEASURE?

08:33.724 --> 08:37.137
YOU HEARD ABOUT THE INCIDENT
IN PIERCE'S CLASS YESTERDAY?

08:37.137 --> 08:38.769
I DID.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.811
DO YOU KNOW
GORDON WILLIAMS?
OF COURSE.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.402
HE'S ONE OF
OUR BIGGEST DONORS.

08:44.234 --> 08:46.066
[ SIGHS ]
AND HIS DAUGHTER MALLORY

08:46.066 --> 08:47.698
IS IN PIERCE'S CLASS.
NOT ANYMORE.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.069
WILLIAMS IS
PULLING HER OUT.

08:49.069 --> 08:50.781
THAT'S AN OVERREACTION,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:50.781 --> 08:54.454
PIERCE HAD A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE
IN FRONT OF 30 STUDENTS.

08:54.454 --> 08:57.077
LOOK, I DON'T THINK I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME TRAGIC INCIDENTS

08:57.077 --> 08:59.079
INVOLVING THE MENTALLY ILL
AT UNIVERSITIES IN RECENT YEARS.

08:59.079 --> 09:03.003
WE NEED TO SHOW WILLIAMS THAT
WE TAKE HIS CONCERN SERIOUSLY.

09:03.003 --> 09:04.755
OKAY.
I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.

09:04.755 --> 09:06.216
NO. WILLIAMS WANTS TO
TALK TO PIERCE.

09:06.216 --> 09:08.428
CHANCELLOR,
I-I JUST DON'T THINK

09:08.428 --> 09:11.261
THAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO RESOLVE THIS.

09:11.261 --> 09:15.095
PAUL, LET'S BE FRANK.
WE'VE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM HERE.

09:15.095 --> 09:17.267
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS
TAUGHT BY A SCHIZOPHRENIC.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.680
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE,

09:19.680 --> 09:22.813
BUT WE CANNOT FIRE DANIEL
BECAUSE HE HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.945
IT IS AGAINST THE AMERICANS
WITH DISABILITIES ACT!

09:24.945 --> 09:26.486
HE WOULDN'T BE FIRED
FOR BEING MENTALLY ILL.

09:26.486 --> 09:28.188
PIERCE HAS RACKED UP
A LONG LIST OF VIOLATIONS.

09:28.188 --> 09:29.780
HE DOESN'T ATTEND
FACULTY MEETINGS.

09:29.780 --> 09:32.492
HE REFUSES TO SUBMIT SYLLABI
