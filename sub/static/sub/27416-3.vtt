00:06.400 --> 00:08.159
How's your mum? She's in hospital.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.759
We've got a snake, bruv. It's
that kid with the dog, trust me.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.759
Ra'nell, they let me out for the day.
I'm at the flat.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.079
Now man's got these straps,
man can deal with Kamale.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.159
Them two little fuckers
owe me a lot of money.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.879
If they don't meet that deadline,
you can kill 'em.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.239
Don't grab him, just hold him.
If Kamale wants his cousin back,

00:28.240 --> 00:30.199
he has to bring the food, innit?

00:30.200 --> 00:32.519
Fucking dead, blood.
You killed him, bruv!

00:32.520 --> 00:36.519
I didn't mean this shit!

We will forgive every man,
woman and child.

01:22.551 --> 01:24.510
We will forgive. Amen!

01:24.511 --> 01:25.550
Amen. Amen.

01:25.551 --> 01:29.550
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

01:35.871 --> 01:39.070
See, I told you it wasn't
going to be that bad, didn't I?

01:39.071 --> 01:43.070
You know my son, Dushane?

02:01.608 --> 02:03.407
What you doin' here?

02:03.408 --> 02:05.207
What you doin' here?

02:05.208 --> 02:09.207
I ain't seen you
in like three days. You OK?

02:09.328 --> 02:11.687
Yeah.

02:11.688 --> 02:15.047
Look, you know we knew this was
gonna happen sooner or later, innit.

02:15.048 --> 02:17.927
Yeah. I woulda preferred it
to be later though, bruv, and

02:17.928 --> 02:21.447
I woulda preferred it to be
someone that fucking deserved it.

02:21.448 --> 02:23.727
Those aren't good thoughts
to behaving, Shane.

02:23.728 --> 02:27.727
The best thing we can
do is just block it out.

02:28.208 --> 02:30.247
You tell anyone?

02:30.248 --> 02:34.247
You think I'm mad?

02:38.688 --> 02:40.687
Look,
as long as only me and you know

02:40.688 --> 02:44.687
what went down... then we're cool.

02:46.848 --> 02:50.847
Keep it that way, innit.

02:54.328 --> 02:56.767
Y'all right, Mrs Hill? Wanna lift?

02:56.768 --> 02:59.527
No, thanks, we'll walk.

02:59.528 --> 03:01.007
You sure?

03:01.008 --> 03:05.007
Later on.

03:07.408 --> 03:09.287
There's something about that boy.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.567
Good, good. I told you you'd like it.

03:16.568 --> 03:18.367
Some nice girls in there.

03:18.368 --> 03:21.367
Yeah!

03:21.368 --> 03:23.567
Oh...

03:23.568 --> 03:27.007
What a waste of life.

03:27.008 --> 03:29.327
Mrs Campbell is my
church sister, you know.

03:29.328 --> 03:33.327
She'll never see her son again.

03:37.048 --> 03:41.047
I'll buy some flowers and
bring them down tomorrow.

03:52.768 --> 03:55.727
Listen,
I'll be up in a minute, yeah, Mum?

03:55.728 --> 03:59.727
Go on. I'm coming.

04:04.248 --> 04:08.247
That must be your mum. Looks like a nice lady.
I thought you'da been in touch by now.

04:09.008 --> 04:11.247
I'm dealing with it.

04:11.248 --> 04:14.807
I ain't in the habit of chasing
my own debts. That's Lee's job.

04:14.808 --> 04:15.847
Now look at the fucking state of him.

04:15.848 --> 04:17.647
Yeah, well he deserved that.

04:17.648 --> 04:21.367
What happened to your brother,
that was down to me.

04:21.368 --> 04:25.367
Now when I get my money,
you'll have to come up
with a way to make this right by Lee

04:26.048 --> 04:30.047
cos he ain't gonna fucking
swallow this and neither am I!

04:39.888 --> 04:43.887
Leon.

04:45.968 --> 04:49.767
Right, who wants some gym time?

04:49.768 --> 04:53.767
Mandy?

04:54.328 --> 04:58.327
All right. Rachel?

04:58.968 --> 05:00.647
I'll go.

05:00.648 --> 05:04.647
Good. There's room for more.

05:07.448 --> 05:11.447
OK.
Come on.

05:25.688 --> 05:28.887
This is it. I just need
20 grand for the deposit.

05:28.888 --> 05:31.607
Do you like it?
What do you think?

05:31.608 --> 05:32.807
Where are the shops?

05:32.808 --> 05:34.607
Where are the shops?!

05:34.608 --> 05:37.607
It's nice to be away from the shops
and the people and all that.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.207
It's boring.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.327
Shut up.

05:40.328 --> 05:42.927
Needs decorating, course.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.927
I'll decorate it for you.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.807
You're on.

05:47.808 --> 05:51.007
I don't think I've got
enough for that deposit.

05:51.008 --> 05:53.007
You could ask more for the crop.

05:53.008 --> 05:57.007
I'm selling wholesale to the
Vietnamese. Know what that means?

05:57.128 --> 05:58.127
A lower price?

05:58.128 --> 05:59.687
Quite a good bit lower.

05:59.688 --> 06:03.007
You should sell to somebody else.
I know these olders on the estate.

06:03.008 --> 06:05.927
No, no, no.
You haven't told anyone, have you?

06:05.928 --> 06:07.567
No...

06:07.568 --> 06:11.567
I swear.

06:11.768 --> 06:13.967
That is the way you get
caught, that is.

06:13.968 --> 06:17.127
It's safer to sell
to the Vietnamese.

06:17.128 --> 06:19.247
But then you don't get the flat.

06:19.248 --> 06:22.247
Well, if it's not meant to be,
it's not meant to be, is it?

06:22.248 --> 06:26.247
Just getting bare
missed calls, ya'know.

06:26.648 --> 06:28.967
It's like it's popping, bruv.

06:28.968 --> 06:32.527
No food. At this rate,
it's a job centre ting, bruv.
You think I'm joking?

06:32.528 --> 06:36.527
I ain't goin' no job centre, blood.

06:41.088 --> 06:42.647
Yo. Wha' gwarn?

06:42.648 --> 06:45.247
Yo, Shane. Did you hear about Shaun?

06:45.248 --> 06:46.567
Some messed up shit, bruv.

06:46.568 --> 06:48.567
Yeah.
What happened to Shaun was dark.

06:48.568 --> 06:51.087
Shaun wasn't even a road man.
He was like innocent.

06:51.088 --> 06:52.607
It's bad luck on him, bruv.

06:52.608 --> 06:55.407
Either way, it gives us
an opportunity, ya get me?

06:55.408 --> 06:57.287
Shaun is Kamale's cousin, innit.

06:57.288 --> 07:00.687
He might be careful, but he ain't
gonna disrespect his family, get me?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.767
Kamale's gotta show.

07:02.768 --> 07:05.607
I reckon either at
the shrine or at his auntie's yard.

07:05.608 --> 07:08.807
And when he shows that's
when we make our move, innit.

07:08.808 --> 07:10.727
A'ight,
you two, you go down the shrine.

07:10.728 --> 07:12.487
What?

07:12.488 --> 07:14.767
Go to the shrine.
Keep a look out, anyone comes

07:14.768 --> 07:16.887
make sure you call one of us.
Fucking hurry up.

07:16.888 --> 07:20.887
Find a good spot, bruv.
Where no-one can see you lot.

07:22.888 --> 07:25.127
What you sayin'? Wha' gwarn?

07:25.128 --> 07:27.727
Oi, where you lot goin'?

07:27.728 --> 07:29.327
School.

07:29.328 --> 07:33.327
Nah, you've got the day off.
I want you to do me a favour.
Go down to London Fields for me.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.327
What?! That' E8? Ain't my gates.

07:35.328 --> 07:39.327
Bruv, shut up, man. Don't worry
about that. Just go down
there and keep your eye out.

07:39.608 --> 07:43.247
If you see Kamale, Ninja, bell me.
Straight away, yeah?

07:43.248 --> 07:44.887
Here, take that.

07:44.888 --> 07:47.927
Make sure you bell me, you know.

07:47.928 --> 07:51.207
Yeah. Don't leave till you see him.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.967
Safe.

07:52.968 --> 07:56.487
Yo, you know I got a ting that lives
opposite Shaun's Mumsie's yard.

07:56.488 --> 07:57.567
Yeah?

07:57.568 --> 07:59.887
Right, you go and check there innit.

07:59.888 --> 08:02.687
Right. Cool.

08:02.688 --> 08:06.687
He's going to fuck that out.

08:09.168 --> 08:13.167
I know he is. Bruv, I'm telling you,
if man don't deal with Kamale,
Raikes is coming after man.

08:13.808 --> 08:16.887
Simple as that.

08:16.888 --> 08:19.767
Hear dat, but yo,
there's that other ting. The snake.

08:19.768 --> 08:21.887
Bruv, we ain't got
time for that now!

08:21.888 --> 08:24.807
Blood, we can't put this off.
If it weren't for that snake

08:24.808 --> 08:27.647
fucking house wouldn't
have got lick down.

08:27.648 --> 08:29.847
Man wouldn't even be in this mess

08:29.848 --> 08:32.807
You know someone's talking, man.
It's that Gem kid.

08:32.808 --> 08:35.847
Listen, you're going on like you
want it to be him or summit, bruv.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.847
I'm sayin' I don' think it's him.
Just fucking leave him, man!

08:40.488 --> 08:42.407
What?!

08:42.408 --> 08:44.407
What are you sayin'?

08:44.408 --> 08:46.007
What? Why you giving me orders?

08:46.008 --> 08:47.527
I ain't giving no orders.

08:47.528 --> 08:51.527
You just said leave him, no? Like,
that sounded like an order, fam.

08:52.848 --> 08:54.287
Why you giving me orders?

08:54.288 --> 08:58.287
Bruv, I ain't givin' you no orders.
I just said we ain't got time for
this shit, bruv.

09:02.848 --> 09:05.647
You know what? You go down the
school.

09:05.648 --> 09:09.647
Tell that kid I wanna
talk to him. Yeah?

09:11.768 --> 09:14.727
Fam, what's up wid you?
I'm ain't tryin' to make a big issue

09:14.728 --> 09:18.407
out of this or nothin', but I'm just
sayin' like, I don't think it's him.

09:18.408 --> 09:22.407
Well, we're just gonna have
to disagree on this one.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.687
Whatever, man.

09:27.688 --> 09:31.527
Collect as many pictures as possible
for your subject and bring them in.

09:31.528 --> 09:32.847
Yo!

09:32.848 --> 09:36.847

09:37.008 --> 09:38.567

09:38.568 --> 09:41.327
Come man, come chill. Bring your
dog, come do some tricks.

09:41.328 --> 09:42.327

Fuck your dad.
Fuck school. Come we go.

09:44.368 --> 09:46.807

Oi! Hear what I'm saying.
Sully wants to chat to you.

09:49.528 --> 09:51.287
Miss, look. Gem's in trouble.

09:51.288 --> 09:54.527
Stay here. Get some help.
What are you doing? Leave him alone.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.567
Fuck off.

09:55.568 --> 09:57.607
Gem, get inside.
I'll call the police. Oh!

09:57.608 --> 10:00.767
Fuck off, you stupid bitch.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.247

10:07.008 --> 10:10.287
Come inside.
Let's get you cleaned up.

10:10.288 --> 10:14.287
Oi, Gem! Stop fucking running.
I ain't gonna hurt you, bruv.

10:27.328 --> 10:31.327
Dog Boy! When I catch you,
I'm gonna fuck you up!

10:37.088 --> 10:38.167
What's happened?

10:38.168 --> 10:41.167
Some boy came for Gem and
punched Miss in the face.

10:41.168 --> 10:42.487
What?!

10:42.488 --> 10:44.727
Stop chatting and get to
class. Move on. Go on.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.967
You lot, clear the corridor
and get to class.

10:46.968 --> 10:48.447
What's he done? I dunno.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.687
Ra'Nell, move!

10:49.688 --> 10:50.767
Where is he now?

DOOR SLAMS

12:10.888 --> 12:14.247
Tareek says it was them Muslim boys
from Whitechapel that done Shaun.

12:14.248 --> 12:16.887
Or it might've
been the Tottenham Mob.

12:16.888 --> 12:18.247
It weren't no Tottenham Mob.
It was Dushane.

12:18.248 --> 12:19.927
Dushane done Shaun?

12:19.928 --> 12:20.927
Yeah, man. Dushane's done
like loadsa hits.

12:20.928 --> 12:23.367
How many hits has he done?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.327
Like, 20, 37. Gets a kill every time

12:25.328 --> 12:28.847
and the feds never catch him cos
he's too smart for them, innit.

12:28.848 --> 12:31.887
Him and Sully come my house
the night it happened.

12:31.888 --> 12:32.887
What for?

12:32.888 --> 12:33.727
To keep the straps.

12:33.728 --> 12:34.887
What straps?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.327
The ones they blew Shaun away with.

12:36.328 --> 12:38.647
The news didn't say
nothing 'bout Shaun.

12:38.648 --> 12:42.647
That's because the news
don't know nothin'. They shot him.

13:16.928 --> 13:20.471
(SOBS)
Thank You.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.767
Yeah.

14:19.768 --> 14:21.807
Yo, cuz.
My man got away, you know, blood.

14:21.808 --> 14:23.207
What do you mean he got away?

14:23.208 --> 14:24.727
He's a fast runner, blood!

14:24.728 --> 14:25.807
'Listen, Dris.'

14:25.808 --> 14:28.127
I don't want to hear the excuses.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.847
Look, just - you find him.
And when you do, bell me, yeah?

14:30.848 --> 14:34.847
'All right, cool.'

14:35.728 --> 14:38.287
Keep sending him texts,
but he ain't replying.

14:38.288 --> 14:41.167
Try him again.

14:41.168 --> 14:45.167

15:08.888 --> 15:10.967
That's all right. Let him in.

15:10.968 --> 15:14.967
Thank you.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.327
All right, then.
So, go on. What is it?

15:24.328 --> 15:26.487
Well, you're the one
going through it!

15:26.488 --> 15:29.087
Listen, man. I'm your older brother.
I can read you like a book, remember?

15:29.088 --> 15:32.487
I just came up to check you, innit?

15:32.488 --> 15:35.327
Just make sure
you're all right and that.

15:35.328 --> 15:39.327
Haven't seen you since it happened.

15:40.848 --> 15:43.927
Shane, you've got to get
yourself out of this, man.

15:43.928 --> 15:45.487
I will.

15:45.488 --> 15:49.087
When I've made enough money.

15:49.088 --> 15:52.367
You're going to be dead
before you've made enough.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.407
It ain't right making money that way.

15:54.408 --> 15:58.407
Chris, what's wrong with you?
You ain't never smoked no weed, huh?

15:58.928 --> 16:02.927
You ain't ever done a line of coke?
Where do you think
all that comes from?

16:03.528 --> 16:05.647
I'm trying to make it right, here.

16:05.648 --> 16:09.087
You're not going to make it right,
are you?

16:09.088 --> 16:11.727
I mean, look at me!

16:11.728 --> 16:13.247
Listen.

16:13.248 --> 16:15.047
You're my brother.

16:15.048 --> 16:19.007
And I love you, OK? I always will.

16:19.008 --> 16:23.007
I can't let you step foot
in this house again, man.

16:23.688 --> 16:27.687
I'm sorry.

16:31.488 --> 16:34.767
I did't know about what happened
with you and your dad.

16:34.768 --> 16:36.247
Don't tell no-one.

16:36.248 --> 16:40.247
I wouldn't tell anyone anything
you didn't want me to, Ra'Nell.

16:43.048 --> 16:47.047
He used to beat my mum.

16:49.168 --> 16:51.807
That time when he had her
in the kitchen by her throat.

16:51.808 --> 16:55.487
I picked up a knife.
Don't remember what happened,

16:55.488 --> 16:59.127
but I know I stabbed him.

16:59.128 --> 17:03.127
I won't tell anyone.

17:05.167 --> 17:09.166
You've made really good progress,
Lisa. We're very pleased with you.

17:09.808 --> 17:13.807
So what we have to discuss now
is putting together the support
to enable you to go home.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.567
Home?

17:15.568 --> 17:18.487
Mmm-hmm.

17:18.488 --> 17:21.367
Good. That's good news.

17:21.367 --> 17:25.327
You'll still see me as an
out-patient. We'll discuss
any problems, anxieties.

17:25.328 --> 17:28.767
But the important thing
is to keep taking the medication.

17:28.768 --> 17:29.847
I will.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.727
Don't be tempted to stop.

17:32.728 --> 17:36.727
We'll aim to reduce the dose very
gradually, when the time's right.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.807
Good.

17:40.808 --> 17:44.807
We think you're ready.

18:41.928 --> 18:42.807

18:42.808 --> 18:44.887
There's a load of people
outside the house.

18:44.888 --> 18:46.007
Yeah?

18:46.008 --> 18:48.727
Lot of people coming in and out,
but Kamale ain't one so far.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.367
'What you saying -
you can't see Dwight or Ninja?'

18:52.368 --> 18:54.127
What, none of Kamale's boys?

18:54.128 --> 18:57.127
No, none of them showed up neither.

18:57.128 --> 18:58.247
All right, fam.

18:58.248 --> 19:02.247
Just keep watching. He has
to turn up sooner or later, innit?

19:02.568 --> 19:03.847
All right, cool.

19:03.848 --> 19:07.167
'Boy, put the phone down
and come grind the garlic!'

19:07.168 --> 19:09.687
All right, Mum. I'm coming.

19:09.688 --> 19:13.687

every minute.

19:37.928 --> 19:41.927

All right.

21:54.168 --> 21:55.407

21:55.408 --> 21:59.407
You want to watch cartoons? Yeah?

21:59.648 --> 22:00.927
Let's feed them.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.207
Can't feed no nuts.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.967
Let's see what's on.

22:03.968 --> 22:07.967
Are you going to watch cartoons?

22:30.368 --> 22:33.807
Hey, man, I'm hungry.

22:33.808 --> 22:37.807
I've got some food in my bag.

22:40.688 --> 22:44.687

23:08.528 --> 23:10.207
D'you think the boy got him?

23:10.208 --> 23:11.607
I don't know.

23:11.608 --> 23:13.847
What you going to do?

23:13.848 --> 23:15.887
Go back to the flats, I suppose.

23:15.888 --> 23:18.207
Maybe Gem'll creep in later.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.527
D'you want to come and wait with me?

23:20.528 --> 23:21.607
What, at yours?

23:21.608 --> 23:23.287
No, I'll take you somewhere else.

23:23.288 --> 23:27.287
Yeah, OK.

23:58.328 --> 24:00.007
Where are we going?

24:00.008 --> 24:04.007
You'll see.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.487
I wouldn't like to live on my own.

24:14.488 --> 24:15.847
Neither would I.

24:15.848 --> 24:19.047
