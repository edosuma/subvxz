00:09.480 --> 00:12.278
This is such a beautiful sunset.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.153
Thanks.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.113
Thanks? You're taking credit
for the sunset?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.471
No, not-- Not the sunset per se.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.358
But l did buy a house on the beach. . .

00:22.520 --> 00:24.795
. . .so we can stand here
and watch the sunset. . .

00:24.960 --> 00:27.793
. . .so thanks.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.510
Your house works with
a lot of women, doesn't it?

00:31.080 --> 00:35.392
Honestly, it's like a G-spot
with two mortgages.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.079
Just so you know, l'm not with you
for your house or your money.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.238
So it's the car.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.919
Why would l care about your car?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.116
lt's an $80,000 Mercedes.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.550
Yeah, so? What does it do
that other cars don't do?

00:47.720 --> 00:49.233
lt costs $80,000.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.638
Hey, l almost forgot.
l have something for you.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.354
Charlie, you don't have
to buy me expensive jewelry.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.677
Okay, nothing but cheap crap
from now on.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.354
lt's beautiful.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.272
Read the inscription.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.792
''One month, two weeks, four days. ''
What does it mean?

01:10.400 --> 01:15.758
Well, since we decided to go ahead and
consummate our relationship finally. . .

01:16.280 --> 01:19.317
. . .l thought l should honor the time
we've already spent together.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.516
Exclusively.
ln a committed relationship.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.390
Without any sex whatsoever.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.237
So unless we have sex
before midnight. . .

01:29.400 --> 01:31.960
. . .you're gonna need to buy
a new bracelet?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.918
You're pretty sure of yourself.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.954
Well, since you went to all the trouble
to engrave it. . . .

01:39.160 --> 01:41.799
Don't even ask what l used
as a chisel.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.312
-Kandi.
-Hello, Alan.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.438
ls Charlie available?
Because l wish to speak with him.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.357
Okay, why don't you just wait here. . .

01:56.520 --> 01:57.635
. . .and l'll let him know.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.553
l would be immensely appreciative
if you would.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.999
Alrighty.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.110
What the hell does. . .this mean?

02:45.640 --> 02:47.278
-l was sending you a message.
-What?

02:47.440 --> 02:49.431
That you're a woman trapped
in a man's body?

02:50.200 --> 02:53.317
-Kandi's here.
-And you want me to call you Kandi?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.990
No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing
before Mia.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.078
She's been calling here for days.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.674
lt's time you let her know
you're with another woman.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.715
Yeah, Charlie, after all it's been
''one month, two weeks, four days. ''

03:10.440 --> 03:13.398
Did you know that Alan's
a woman trapped in a man's body?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.829
So you gonna go talk
to your ex-girlfriend?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.752
Okay, first of all, sweetheart. . .

03:25.920 --> 03:27.797
. . .she's not really an ex-girlfriend.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.871
Her name's Kandi.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.994
Thanks, Alan.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.148
With a K.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.320
-Alan.
-And an l.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.114
So if Kandi with a K and an l
isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she?

03:42.720 --> 03:45.951
Well, l-- l-- l would say
she's more of a person. . .

03:46.120 --> 03:50.398
. . .who would drop by
from time to time and--

03:50.560 --> 03:52.596
Yeah, that.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.792
Why haven't you told this person
that you're in a relationship?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.797
Her name's Kandi.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.073
Boy, you're on thin ice.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.670
l think we both know
why you didn't tell her.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.559
Well, if that's the case,
then this discussion is moot.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.196
We should go upstairs
while Alan goes back. . .

04:10.360 --> 04:12.078
. . .and lies about my whereabouts.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.637
Well, l'm not half the liar you are,
but l'll give it a shot.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.034
Shall we go upstairs
and continue this conversation?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.992
Are you out of your freaking mind?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.759
Okay, you're mad, l get that.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.796
-So?
-Well, Kandi, it's like this.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.358
Charlie's with another woman.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.515
Don't lie to me, Alan.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.199
Okay.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.998
He's in Africa. . .

04:42.160 --> 04:45.072
. . .working as a scrub nurse
for Doctors Without Borders.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.513
Story of my life.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.553
That's the story of your life?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.638
lt's not always a scrub nurse. . .

04:52.800 --> 04:55.030
. . .but it's always Africa.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.030
Before you say anything,
l want you to know. . .

04:59.200 --> 05:03.193
. . .l've anticipated problems like this.
Look on the other side of the bracelet.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.596
''l'm very, very sorry. ''

05:11.040 --> 05:14.919
Problem is, Charlie, that you don't
believe in this relationship.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.634
Not believe in it?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.553
lt's kept me from having sex
for over six weeks.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.593
lt would be like not believing
in a serious groin pull.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.951
-You know what Kandi is?
-l try not to judge.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.709
She's a lifeboat. You're keeping
a lifeboat for when this ship sinks.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.150
Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats
don't mean you expect. . .

05:32.320 --> 05:36.359
. . .the ship to sink.
The relationship, if l may.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.513
What they mean is that you have
a healthy respect. . .

05:39.680 --> 05:42.513
. . .for the power of the sea.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.878
Are you listening to yourself?

05:45.680 --> 05:49.195
Yeah, l just caught the last part.
Not well thought out. No.

05:49.680 --> 05:54.470
All my life guys have looked at me
like l'm just some kind of sex toy.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.992
Well, they're wrong.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.630
Yeah, just because you're good
at something. . .

05:59.800 --> 06:02.234
. . .doesn't mean you
should be pigeonholed.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.995
And the only reason
l'm so good at it. . .

06:12.160 --> 06:14.390
. . .is because l practice.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.551
Of course,
all the practice in the world. . .

06:19.720 --> 06:22.792
. . .isn't gonna help if you don't
love what you're doing.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.359
What do you want me to do, Mia?

06:28.520 --> 06:29.919
Call every woman l've known. . .

06:30.080 --> 06:31.991
. . .to announce l'm now
in a relationship?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.191
Hi, Shirley, this is Charlie Harper.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.716
We met at Disneyland
about 22 years ago.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.998
Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
That was me.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.833
Anyway, l thought you should know
l have a girlfriend now.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.196
So l'd appreciate it if you
didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.759
Well, that takes care of Shirley.
Now, what about Kandi?

06:52.960 --> 06:55.428
You want me to tell her?
Fine. l'll tell her.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.950
l'll go tell her right now.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.194
But before l cut
her loose completely. . .

07:02.360 --> 07:04.157
. . .let me float a crazy idea by you.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.831
Sort of a win, win, win.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.271
Are you out of your freaking mind?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.316
lt was worth a shot.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.434
Kandi, before you say anything,
l want you to know. . .

07:20.600 --> 07:24.559
. . .l'm in a committed relationship now
and l'm really in love with this woman.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.756
She's the best thing
that's happened to me. . .

07:26.960 --> 07:29.269
. . .and l can't imagine
being with anyone else.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.908
Now, sweetheart.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.554
Don't cry.
l'm sure you'll find someone else.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.350
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.829
What?
l thought we were going upstairs.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.191
Okay, you're still mad. l get that.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.068
-l made your bed.
-Thank you.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.872
lt's been real easy lately.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.552
How nice for you.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.194
You haven't even been flying solo,
have you?

08:02.920 --> 08:04.194
That's a little personal.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.073
Hey, you want privacy,
wash your own sheets.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.317
Once l get my mitts on them,
they're in the public domain.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.072
-Good morning.
-Morning.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.471
-How did it go with Mia last night?
-Based on his laundry, not well.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.434
-Why don't you tell the neighbors?
-Where do you think l'm going?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.829
By the way,
thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.752
Hey, l'm your brother.
l got your back.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.319
Good to know.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.313
Hey, as long as we're on the subject,
l was wondering.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.836
Since you're swimming in
Lake Monogamy, as it were. . .

08:34.960 --> 08:37.996
. . .would you mind if l, you know. . .

08:38.159 --> 08:40.309
-. . .asked Kandi out sometime?
-Go for it.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.794
-Just wanted to make sure you're okay.
-l'm fine.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.153
-Don't want you to feel weird.
-Thanks for your consideration.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.113
Morning, Huggy Bear.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.118
So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?

09:06.640 --> 09:08.835
Okay, l want you to know
l tracked down Kandi.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.678
l told her to move on and she has.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.479
So l got no lifeboats,
no life preservers, no water wings.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.995
lf the ship goes down,
l'm going down with it.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.875
So there's no longer any reason to
put off you and me getting naked.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.640
Charlie, l'd like you
to meet my parents.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.189
Hello.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.111
What if Dad says l could stay up
to watch it?

09:37.280 --> 09:38.793
He won't.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.069
How do you know?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.431
Your father and l talk, so don't
try to play us against each other.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.108
l gotta try, it's what l do.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.278
Hi.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.955
Hello. ls Alan here?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.596
Father Huggy Bear.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.237
Yes, my child?

09:59.640 --> 10:02.074
-You've got company.
-Alan?

10:03.520 --> 10:06.557
-Stall them, stall them, stall them.
-Okay.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.349
You must be Jake.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.112
And you must be Jake's grandma.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.757
Judith, hi.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.074
Go watch some cartoons.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.396
-Okay.
-Cool.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.669
-Are you proud of yourself?
-What do you mean?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.677
Oh, please,
she has to be half your age.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.114
Oh, that.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.111
Yeah, l am pretty proud of that.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.752
What could you possibly
have in common?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.718
-What do you talk about?
-Talk?

10:42.320 --> 10:45.198
To tell you the truth, we haven't
really done a lot of talking.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.272
l mean, l did hear her confession.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.440
She's been a very bad girl.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.679
l'm supposed to leave Jake here?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.796
What kind of message does
that send him?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.598
l don't know.
Dreams can come true.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.274
Life is beautiful. There is a God.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.394
Hey, Judith. Father.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.397
l suppose you're the one that
introduced Alan to that slutty little--

11:11.560 --> 11:14.358
Don't say it, Judith.
You'll just be demeaning all women.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.033
And yes.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.875
Figures. Well, l don't want
her around my son.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.398
Oh, really? So do l get to screen
the men that you're dating?

11:22.560 --> 11:25.597
Let's not forget about the guy
who delivered the truckload of sod.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.155
-What about him?
-lt doesn't take two months. . .

11:28.320 --> 11:29.912
. . .to put down a new lawn, Judith.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.278
Sounds like she got laid
before the sod did.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.516
l'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.674
Watch out for crab grass.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.760
So, what's Kandi, a nun?

11:47.960 --> 11:49.313
Catholic school girl.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.516
Oh, excellent choice.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.510
Oh, hey, how--?
How are things with Mia?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.518
Not bad. She forgives me.
lntroduced me to her parents.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.551
Oh, yeah? How did that go?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.913
Well, you know,
those things are always awkward.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.713
The big news is l'm taking Mia
to the Bel Air Hotel tonight. . .

12:06.880 --> 12:09.952
. . .where we will express our love
in the way that we were meant to.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.838
-Drunk and in a hurry?
-You got it.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.232
-How's the caviar?
-lt's perfect.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.839
Everything's perfect.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.750
-Would you like a fire?
-Don't go to any trouble.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.995
lt's no trouble.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.034
Luckily l was a Boy Scout
in Beverly Hills.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.798
-Champagne?
-No, thanks.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.992
l wanna be completely present
for the first time we make love.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.752
Good for you.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.671
Don't you want to be present?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.837
Well, within reason.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.398
Come on.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.919
What do you say
we save the champagne?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.752
But l already opened it.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.712
Do you need alcohol
to make love to me?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.478
No, no.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.471
l don't need it.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.477
Well, then.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.038
ls something wrong?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.599
l don't know.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.558
l mean, we didn't hop into bed
on the first date.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.399
We've gotten to know each other.
We're not drinking.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.391
lt's all so new to me.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.672
That's what makes it special.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.599
l just don't want either of us
to be disappointed. . .

13:19.760 --> 13:22.832
. . .because one of us might not be. . .

13:23.000 --> 13:24.513
. . .throwing their A-game tonight.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.439
-Are you nervous?
-No, no. Of course not.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.832
But, you know, of the two of us,
only one can fake an A-game.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.994
There's nothing that you could do
to disappoint me tonight.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.311
No, no, it's what l can't do
that might disappoint you.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.556
You just relax. l'll be right back.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.313
Okay.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.236
Why don't you put some music on?

14:43.880 --> 14:45.438
Okay.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.632
-Should l ask?
-l wish you wouldn't.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.757
l'm not supposed to play this
because my mom says it's too violent.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.313
lt has to be violent.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.311
You can't negotiate with zombies.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.717
-Don't tell me, tell her.
-l don't think she likes me.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.512
She doesn't really like anybody.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.194
Except the guy who keeps
putting grass in our backyard.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.675
Okay, time for bed.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.831
-Just a little longer.
-l'm not sleepy.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.119
No, him.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.996
l get to stay up.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.831
-That's not fair.
-Jake.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.355
Just because she's a girl.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.956
-Wanna play?
-Oh, no, thanks.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.917
l-- l thought maybe we could just talk.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.637
Hang on. Let me just saw off
this zombie's head.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.359
Good Lord.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.112
There we go.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.390
Now, let me save my work.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.115
Okay, all done.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.231
Wanna have sex?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.875
Actually, l do.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.350
But maybe we could spend a little time
getting to know each other first.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.596
All right.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.795
What do you wanna know?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.915
Well, do you have
any brothers or sisters?

16:03.480 --> 16:04.913
l do not. How about you?

16:09.800 --> 16:10.949
Well, Charlie.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.240
Oh, right, Charlie.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.555
-Do you like to read?
-Oh, yeah, l love reading.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.518
Oh, great, great, me too.
Read anything good lately?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.877
You mean like books and magazines. . .

16:27.040 --> 16:29.759
. . .not billboards
and text messages, right?

16:31.440 --> 16:33.874
-Yeah.
-Then, no.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.676
Do menus count?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.473
Are you ready for me?

16:46.520 --> 16:50.069
Mia, if l were any more ready,
l'd be done.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.999
Oh, jeez, l'm sorry. You okay?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.513
-l think so.
-Are you sure?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.397
Yeah, l'm fine.

17:08.760 --> 17:09.909
Are you okay?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.869
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.996
But l think that's enough foreplay.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.637
You see, the thing for me was
that l never should have gotten married.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.518
l was young,
l didn't know who l was.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.315
And to be completely honest,
l was just afraid of being alone.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.556
Can l share something with you?

17:44.760 --> 17:47.479
Yes, please. This is communicating,
this is how we connect.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.993
You shouldn't tell people that stuff,
it makes you sound like a loser.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.709
No, it makes me sound like
a real human being.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.155
A person with feelings and flaws.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.078
Loser.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.195
-Why don't we just go have sex?
-Finally.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.591
Oh, cheer up.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.991
lt wasn't that bad.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.678
There were parts of it that l liked.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.398
Can we please not go over
the game film now?

18:31.680 --> 18:34.319
-What's the big deal?
-What's the big deal?

18:34.520 --> 18:36.829
This is supposed to be the part
that l'm good at.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.155
You are.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.311
lt was fine.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.879
l don't wanna hear fine.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.474
l wanna see the top of
your head blow off.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.599
lt's not a carnival game.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.354
The object is not to swing
your mallet and ring my bell.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.516
Well, we disagree.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.158
That's just your ego talking.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.548
Charlie, listen to me.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.077
l love you, not your money or car
or your house or your skills in bed.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.318
What's left?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.357
-Charlie.
-Oh, come on. Come on.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.956
You're saying that if l was some
pencil-weenie guy living in a shack. . .

19:10.120 --> 19:13.590
. . .and taking the bus to my job selling
oranges on the freeway off-ramp. . .

19:13.760 --> 19:16.752
-. . .you'd still love me?
-Yes, l would still love you.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.153
-Okay, l understand now.
-Good.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.639
You're insane.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.112
Why? Because l love the real you?

19:24.320 --> 19:27.596
No, no, because you think
there is a real me.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.319
Would you believe l love you
if my eyes had rolled back. . .

19:31.480 --> 19:32.799
. . .and my head had blown off?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.429
lt would be a start.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.951
All right. l guess we're just
gonna have to try again.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.633
Hang on. Hang on.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.400
How am l gonna know
you're not faking it?

19:46.600 --> 19:50.149
lf l was gonna fake it, don't you think
l would have done it the first time?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.952
Fair enough.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.313
-Hey, wanna hear something amusing?
-Always.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.078
According to my girlfriend. . .

20:00.240 --> 20:02.879
. . .underneath all the superficial,
cool stuff in my life. . .

20:03.040 --> 20:04.439
. . .there's actually a real me.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.198
-No kidding?
-Apparently, he's quite a guy.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.393
l'd like to meet him sometime.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.794
Don't hold your breath.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.271
My girlfriend, on the other hand,
has no idea who l really am. . .

20:17.480 --> 20:19.118
. . .damn little desire to find out. . .

20:19.280 --> 20:21.840
. . .and is only interested in
riding me like a mustang. . .

20:22.000 --> 20:24.389
. . .and draining me of all bodily fluids.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.911
How do you feel about that?

20:28.440 --> 20:30.158
l think l love her.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.434
You know what. . .

20:32.600 --> 20:36.388
. . .love isn't blind, it's retarded.
