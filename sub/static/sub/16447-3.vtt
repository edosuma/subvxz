WEBVTT

00:02.267 --> 00:03.533
It's pretty late.

00:03.535 --> 00:05.735
You think I've got time
to run some more simulations

00:05.737 --> 00:06.936
on the cooling system?

00:06.938 --> 00:08.204
Sure, I'm still figuring out

00:08.206 --> 00:09.405
the thermo-acoustic expander.

00:09.407 --> 00:10.506
SHELDON:
Oh, while you do that

00:10.508 --> 00:13.843
I am going to pump
cerebral spinal fluid

00:13.845 --> 00:17.046
through my brain cells to remove
the metabolic by-products

00:17.048 --> 00:18.915
of the day's thoughts.

00:18.917 --> 00:20.950
What?

00:20.952 --> 00:22.518
It's called sleep
and it's my bedtime.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.320
Nighty-night, y'all.

00:24.322 --> 00:26.623
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not going anywhere.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.858
We only have two months to
deliver this to the Air Force

00:28.860 --> 00:29.893
because of you.

00:29.895 --> 00:32.662
(yawning):
I know, I was there.

00:32.664 --> 00:34.163
Well, wake up!

00:34.165 --> 00:36.266
We're gonna put in
a lot of late nights.

00:36.268 --> 00:37.600
How late?

00:37.602 --> 00:40.837
Well, I don't know,
midnight, 1:00.

00:40.839 --> 00:41.838
One o'clock?

00:41.840 --> 00:44.107
I'm not a raccoon.

00:44.109 --> 00:47.277
If you're tired,
have some coffee.

00:47.279 --> 00:48.745
What?
You have some coffee.

00:48.747 --> 00:50.446
I am having coffee!

00:50.448 --> 00:52.181
And look how irritable
it's making you!

00:52.183 --> 00:54.217
Guys!

00:54.219 --> 00:56.085
We're not gonna get anything
done if we start fighting.

00:56.087 --> 00:58.254
Now, can you please try
to soldier through?

00:58.256 --> 00:59.422
(sighs)

00:59.424 --> 01:00.957
Fine.

I can go much longer.

01:50.206 --> 01:53.140
SHELDON: I had a bad dream that
my best friend became a tyrant

01:53.142 --> 01:55.476
and forced me to stay
up all night to work.

01:55.478 --> 01:57.745
Oh, I had a good dream that
when I carried you to bed,

01:57.747 --> 02:01.081
I let your head hit
the wall and I laughed.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.750
Good morning.

02:02.752 --> 02:03.818
What is this?

02:03.820 --> 02:05.286
Well, we didn't see you
last night,

02:05.288 --> 02:06.520
we're not gonna see you today,

02:06.522 --> 02:08.889
so we thought we could have
breakfast together.

02:08.890 --> 02:09.889
Oh, that is so nice.

02:09.892 --> 02:13.227
Ow, it does hurt!

02:13.229 --> 02:15.563
So, what are you guys
gonna do today?

02:15.565 --> 02:16.564
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go

02:16.566 --> 02:18.265
to this party with me
this afternoon,

02:18.267 --> 02:19.467
but I don't think
that's happening.

02:19.469 --> 02:21.435
Oh, that was never happening.

02:21.437 --> 02:23.103
Oh, I'll go.

02:23.105 --> 02:24.872
I like a party.

02:24.874 --> 02:26.907
Well, to be honest, it's not
like a "party" party,

02:26.909 --> 02:28.576
it's more like a gathering

02:28.578 --> 02:30.177
where scientists of different
disciplines get together

02:30.179 --> 02:31.645
to share their work
and keep current

02:31.647 --> 02:33.047
on what's going on
in other fields.

02:33.049 --> 02:35.416
I don't know why
I called it a party, sorry.

02:35.418 --> 02:37.318
It's okay, I'll still go.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.086
You don't think you'll be bored?

02:39.088 --> 02:40.955
Oh, I'll have some wine
and listen to people go on

02:40.957 --> 02:42.189
about crap I don't understand.

02:42.191 --> 02:43.123
I mean, how is it any different

02:43.125 --> 02:45.793
than every
single day of my life?

02:45.795 --> 02:47.962
I won't be there.

02:47.964 --> 02:49.446
Look at that, it is a party.

02:49.447 --> 02:51.047
PENNY:
Oh.

02:52.368 --> 02:54.335
Sorry I have to work
all weekend.

02:54.337 --> 02:55.803
It's okay.

02:55.805 --> 02:58.005
Thanks again for breakfast.

02:58.007 --> 02:59.340
Well, I didn't get to
see you last night.

02:59.342 --> 03:01.709
It was the least I could do.

03:01.711 --> 03:04.411
You shouldn't have made
the alarm code his birthday.

03:07.183 --> 03:09.650
So, what should we do today?

03:09.652 --> 03:11.085
Oh, I appreciate it,

03:11.087 --> 03:12.753
but you don't have to
spend your day off with me.

03:12.755 --> 03:14.188
Well, I don't mind.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.490
Oh, you want go to the mall
and look at baby stuff?

03:16.492 --> 03:17.691
Not really.

03:17.693 --> 03:19.159
Oh, come on,
we could share a pretzel

03:19.161 --> 03:23.364
and get sideways glances
from racist old ladies.

03:23.366 --> 03:25.599
I get enough of that
when I take Howard

03:25.601 --> 03:27.468
to my grandmother's
for Christmas.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.570
Oh,

03:29.572 --> 03:32.606
I know, why don't we get started
on clearing out the baby's room?

03:32.608 --> 03:34.008
Isn't it
a little early for that?

03:34.010 --> 03:35.843
You have to
get to it eventually.

03:35.845 --> 03:38.579
Oh, there's so much junk
in there, it's embarrassing.

03:38.581 --> 03:40.781
How can you be
embarrassed around me?

03:40.783 --> 03:43.017
I'm gonna be in the room
with you when you give birth.

03:50.059 --> 03:52.126
I don't think you are.

03:52.128 --> 03:54.461
You didn't think I was gonna be
in your kitchen this morning,

03:54.463 --> 03:56.931
yet here I am.

04:03.139 --> 04:05.005
MAN:
Psst, hey, kid.

04:05.007 --> 04:06.206
Huh, what?

04:08.945 --> 04:10.744
You look tired.

04:10.746 --> 04:12.680
Why don't you have
an energy drink?

04:12.682 --> 04:14.715
Everyone's doing it.

04:14.717 --> 04:18.952
Oh, no, thank you,
those have caffeine in them.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.187
Oh, sorry,

04:20.189 --> 04:22.122
I thought you were cool.

04:23.826 --> 04:25.192
I am cool.

04:25.194 --> 04:26.860
This is Yoo-hoo,

04:26.862 --> 04:29.697
chocolate milk's
delicious watery cousin.

04:29.699 --> 04:31.198
All right.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.101
But if you ever want to feel
like you have superpowers,

04:34.103 --> 04:35.903
try one of these.

04:35.905 --> 04:39.073
Superheroes take
performance-enhancing chemicals?

04:39.075 --> 04:40.207
You bet.

04:40.209 --> 04:42.810
You know why Hulk
is so strong?

04:42.812 --> 04:44.311
Steroids.

04:45.615 --> 04:48.415
You know why Batman
wanders around at night

04:48.417 --> 04:50.618
getting into fights?

04:50.620 --> 04:51.919
Scotch.

04:54.457 --> 04:57.391
I am facing
a great deal of work.

04:57.393 --> 05:01.695
And I do like things better when
famous people also like them.

05:01.697 --> 05:03.831
Here.

05:03.833 --> 05:04.965
It's on the house.

05:04.967 --> 05:08.936
The first one's free?

05:08.938 --> 05:11.538
Flash, how do you
stay in business?

05:11.540 --> 05:13.941
You want to know my secret?

05:13.943 --> 05:16.577
I bought stock in Marvel.

05:19.215 --> 05:20.314
Hi, Bert.

05:20.316 --> 05:21.415
This is my friend, Penny.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.022
Hi.

05:22.047 --> 05:23.019
Hey, come on in.

05:23.019 --> 05:24.819
I'll gonna go turn on
some rock music.

05:24.820 --> 05:25.720
(Amy chuckles)

05:25.721 --> 05:28.122
That's a geology joke.

05:28.124 --> 05:29.556
Bert's a geologist.

05:29.558 --> 05:31.692
And a joker.

05:33.929 --> 05:35.696
How early are we?

05:35.698 --> 05:38.632
Oh, actually,
we're an hour late.

05:38.634 --> 05:41.769
I suddenly wish
Sheldon was here.

05:46.208 --> 05:48.075
I don't even
know where to begin.

05:48.077 --> 05:51.011
Well, in <i>The Sound of Music,</i>
Julie Andrews says,

05:51.013 --> 05:52.579
"Let's start at
the very beginning.

05:52.581 --> 05:54.882
A very good place to start."

05:54.884 --> 05:57.651
Oh, I was gonna start
at the end.

05:57.653 --> 05:59.153
Thank God you're here.

06:00.923 --> 06:04.725
Well, I think the first thing we
should get rid of is that tone.

06:04.727 --> 06:07.861
Sorry.

06:07.863 --> 06:09.196
I should probably keep this

06:09.198 --> 06:10.531
in case we have a girl.

06:10.533 --> 06:11.665
Oh, that's a nice one.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.100
Was it yours when
you were little?

06:13.102 --> 06:14.501
My dad built it for me.

06:14.503 --> 06:16.003
Wow, it's so cute.

06:16.005 --> 06:19.006
This was the husband
and this was the wife.

06:19.008 --> 06:20.607
They'd go out on
adventures together.

06:20.609 --> 06:22.142
Cruises, skiing,

06:22.144 --> 06:23.377
horseback riding.

06:23.379 --> 06:27.081
That was really me just
duct taping them to our dog.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.649
Oh, and did they have kids?

06:28.651 --> 06:31.085
They did, but the mommy
and daddy didn't like them,

06:31.087 --> 06:32.486
so they shipped them off
to an orphanage

06:32.488 --> 06:34.888
I made out of a shoebox.

06:34.890 --> 06:38.759
Yeah, that's not worrisome
at all.

06:38.761 --> 06:42.162
Not every girl dreams
about being a mom.

06:42.164 --> 06:44.998
Sometimes you think
you're never gonna have kids

06:45.000 --> 06:46.967
and one day you wake up
and you're pregnant.

06:46.969 --> 06:48.769
And it doesn't matter that your
career's going great right now

06:48.771 --> 06:50.871
and that you and your husband
never even got to go anywhere

06:50.873 --> 06:53.974
taped to a dog!

06:53.976 --> 06:56.844
I skipped spin class for this.

06:59.849 --> 07:02.916
Why is it taking him so long

07:02.918 --> 07:04.952
to get a drink out
of a vending machine?

07:04.954 --> 07:06.687
Oh, it's complicated.

07:06.689 --> 07:08.088
He finds pushing
that little door

07:08.090 --> 07:11.291
and reaching up into the machine
uncomfortably intimate.

07:11.293 --> 07:13.293
(door opens)

07:13.295 --> 07:15.362
Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

07:15.364 --> 07:18.132
To quote <i>The Martian,</i> "Let's
science the feces out of this!"

07:18.134 --> 07:19.900
That's <i>The Martian</i> the book

07:19.902 --> 07:21.602
and <i>The Martian</i> the movie,
not Marvin the Martian.

07:21.604 --> 07:22.903
Although to quote
Marvin the Martian,

07:22.905 --> 07:24.171
(as Marvin the Martian):
"I claim this planet

07:24.173 --> 07:25.572
in the name of Mars."

07:25.574 --> 07:28.509
Are you okay?

07:28.511 --> 07:30.177
Oh, I'm fantastic,
never been better.

07:30.179 --> 07:31.545
I had my first energy drink

07:31.547 --> 07:32.980
and I feel great.

07:32.982 --> 07:33.914
Hey, you guys want to wrestle?

07:33.916 --> 07:35.649
We can do arm,
thumb, mud, sumo.

07:35.651 --> 07:38.218
Nah, we're not fat enough,
or wearing diapers.

07:41.223 --> 07:42.489
You wanted him awake.

07:51.443 --> 07:54.611
(rock music playing)

07:54.613 --> 07:59.382
So should we talk
to each other or mingle?

07:59.384 --> 08:01.251
I don't know where everyone is.

08:01.253 --> 08:02.285
Yeah, I mean,

08:02.287 --> 08:04.554
I could see him eating
one or two guests,

08:04.556 --> 08:07.357
but not a whole party.

08:07.359 --> 08:09.592
Well, I guess this is
kind of a bust.

08:09.594 --> 08:11.327
You don't have to stay.

08:11.329 --> 08:13.563
I'm gonna start cleaning up.

08:13.565 --> 08:14.898
Okay.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.966
I feel so bad about
leaving him here.

08:16.968 --> 08:20.603
Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

08:20.605 --> 08:21.671
BERT:
Hey, listen,

08:21.673 --> 08:23.973
could you not
say anything about this

08:23.975 --> 08:25.708
to the people at the university?

08:25.710 --> 08:27.444
You know, 'cause...

08:27.446 --> 08:30.613
you're you and I'm me,
and it's kind of embarrassing.

08:30.615 --> 08:32.916
Wait, what do you mean
"she's her"?

08:32.918 --> 08:35.818
Well, you know how Amy's the
coolest girl on campus, right?

08:35.821 --> 08:37.554
No.
No.

08:37.556 --> 08:39.621
Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.091
What?

08:41.092 --> 08:45.995
You tell me about your foot
fungus, but this is a secret?

08:45.997 --> 08:48.298
I'm sure it's just
'cause I'm dating Sheldon.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.935
Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's
popular because he's dating you.

08:53.905 --> 08:55.672
Now Sheldon's popular?

08:55.674 --> 08:58.274
What is happening?

08:59.478 --> 09:01.311
(groans)

09:01.313 --> 09:03.079
Maybe we should break for lunch.

09:03.081 --> 09:04.080
What time is it?

09:04.082 --> 09:07.750
(moans twice)

09:07.752 --> 09:10.920
According to the world's worst
cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

09:10.922 --> 09:13.289
My head hurts

09:13.291 --> 09:15.425
and I'm more tired than ever.

09:15.427 --> 09:16.860
Why don't you just go home?

09:16.862 --> 09:18.461
No, I can do this.

09:18.463 --> 09:22.031
I just, I just need
another energy drink.

09:22.033 --> 09:23.867
Oh, no.

09:23.869 --> 09:25.101
What?

09:25.103 --> 09:26.603
I want another one.

09:26.605 --> 09:27.604
So?

09:27.606 --> 09:29.372
That's a craving.

09:29.374 --> 09:32.408
That's a sign of
chemical dependency.

09:32.410 --> 09:33.943
You only had one.

09:33.945 --> 09:35.078
No, I know,

09:35.080 --> 09:36.346
but plenty of
things are addictive

09:36.348 --> 09:38.014
after a single exposure.

09:38.016 --> 09:42.018
I mean, crack cocaine,
nicotine, Pringles.

09:42.020 --> 09:44.988
You know once one pops
one just can't stop.

09:44.990 --> 09:47.557
You can't develop
a problem that fast.

09:47.559 --> 09:48.791
You want to bet?
Oh, great,

09:48.793 --> 09:50.126
now I'm addicted to gambling.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.634
We can't afford to lose
any more time.

09:57.636 --> 10:00.303
Well, this probably won't
work, but has anyone ever tried

10:00.305 --> 10:04.240
to just haul off and
whoop the crazy out of him?

10:04.242 --> 10:07.110
That's not helpful.

10:07.112 --> 10:09.712
It's fun to think about,
but it's not helpful.

10:10.916 --> 10:14.184
Hey, Sheldon, we are on
a serious time crunch.

10:14.186 --> 10:15.752
We can't do this
without you.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.253
Can you please
pull it together?

10:17.255 --> 10:19.322
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.

10:19.324 --> 10:21.357
Thank you.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.494
Just, please, bear with me
if I display symptoms

10:24.496 --> 10:26.429
of caffeine withdrawal.

10:26.431 --> 10:28.731
No worries.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.521
You guys stink.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.691
Sorry I flipped out on you.

10:54.693 --> 10:56.392
I think it's just hormones.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.894
I think you were mean
before you were pregnant,

10:57.896 --> 10:59.028
but it's fine.

11:00.732 --> 11:03.600
So, uh, instead of
cleaning out the room,

11:03.602 --> 11:06.002
why don't we just decide
on a theme for the nursery?

11:06.004 --> 11:07.470
Does it really need one?

11:07.472 --> 11:09.038
Of course it does.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.007
Didn't your baby room
have a theme?

11:11.009 --> 11:13.042
Well, it doubled
as my dad's office,

11:13.044 --> 11:14.911
and he was a cop,
so I guess the theme was

11:14.913 --> 11:17.447
bloody homicide photos.

11:17.449 --> 11:21.517
Oh. Mine was
<i>Winnie the Pooh.</i>

11:21.519 --> 11:24.454
But anyway...

11:24.456 --> 11:26.689
why don't we just
take a step back

11:26.691 --> 11:27.857
and start with a color?

11:27.859 --> 11:29.525
Right? There are
so many amazing ones.

11:29.527 --> 11:32.495
Red, blue, green, purple...

11:32.497 --> 11:34.130
Are you just gonna name
all the colors?

11:34.132 --> 11:37.300
Well, not now.

11:38.470 --> 11:40.536
I don't care what color
the room is.

11:40.538 --> 11:42.538
Okay, well, I'm just
trying to help you.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.674
Well, you're not,
so just drop it!

11:48.013 --> 11:50.513
I'm clearly upset.
Why aren't you following me?

11:50.515 --> 11:53.716
Sorry! Sorry!

11:54.819 --> 11:57.620
And when Amy started using
a solution of chromic acid

11:57.622 --> 12:00.590
and white vinegar to clean
all her lab equipment,

12:00.592 --> 12:04.260
all of a sudden,
everybody was doing it.

12:05.397 --> 12:07.397
You trend setter!

12:07.399 --> 12:10.700
Just the right idea
at the right time.

12:10.702 --> 12:13.202
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool,
Sheldon's cool.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.405
Tell me about Leonard.
Who?

12:17.475 --> 12:18.875
Leonard Hofstadter.

12:18.877 --> 12:22.011
Oh, him.
I guess he's all right.

12:22.013 --> 12:24.514
Apparently he tricked some
hot girl into marrying him.

12:26.184 --> 12:28.551
That's me, I'm her.

12:28.553 --> 12:29.719
You know, he
didn't trick me.

12:29.721 --> 12:31.988
He just wore me down.

12:31.990 --> 12:34.757
It makes sense
you two are friends.

12:34.759 --> 12:36.859
I mean, hot girls
always stick together.

12:39.698 --> 12:41.030
And you thought this
wasn't gonna be

12:41.032 --> 12:43.466
a great party.

12:43.468 --> 12:44.767
You know, I had no idea

12:44.769 --> 12:47.737
Caltech is exactly
like my high school.

12:47.739 --> 12:49.706
Well, it's not
<i>exactly</i> like it.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.709
We're all
extremely smart.

12:52.711 --> 12:55.978
Wow... you popular
girls are mean.

12:59.918 --> 13:01.751
I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

13:01.753 --> 13:04.454
Uh, you're really going to
have caffeine in front of me

13:04.456 --> 13:06.656
when I'm trying to get
my life back on track?

13:08.259 --> 13:10.960
Uh, okay, let's pretend
you do have a problem.

13:10.962 --> 13:11.961
I do.
You don't.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.731
Yeah, but I do.
No, you don't!

13:14.733 --> 13:15.965
But let's say you do.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.633
And don't say you do,
because you don't!

13:19.304 --> 13:21.904
Now, wouldn't you think
that throwing yourself

13:21.906 --> 13:24.273
into your work would be
the best way to deal with it?

13:24.275 --> 13:26.609
With what?
Your problem.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.578
I thought I didn't have
a problem.

13:33.651 --> 13:35.585
That was painful
to watch.

13:40.058 --> 13:41.257
So where are we going?

13:41.259 --> 13:42.692
I don't know.

13:42.694 --> 13:43.793
Okay.

13:43.795 --> 13:47.463
How <i>Thelma and Louise</i> of us.

13:47.465 --> 13:50.700
Raj, why don't I care
about anything?

13:50.702 --> 13:51.701
I'm sorry?

13:51.703 --> 13:53.536
It's my baby.

13:53.538 --> 13:56.038
I-I should care about
nurseries and colors,

13:56.040 --> 13:58.174
and I don't--
what's wrong with me?

13:58.176 --> 14:02.645
Well, crime-scene photos
near your crib spring to mind.

14:02.647 --> 14:04.847
I keep waiting
to feel excited,

14:04.849 --> 14:06.182
but it's not happening.

14:06.184 --> 14:09.585
What if it
never happens?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.654
Bernadette,
come on, look,

14:11.656 --> 14:13.956
you're overthinking this,
okay?

14:13.958 --> 14:16.159
You're gonna be
an amazing mom.

14:16.161 --> 14:17.393
Even if you don't
believe it,

14:17.395 --> 14:19.729
I know you have
maternal instincts.

14:19.731 --> 14:22.231
Once, I was supposed
to babysit my brothers.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.133
Our neighbor found them
naked in the backyard

14:24.135 --> 14:25.701
eating crickets.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.005
Happy and well-fed.

14:29.007 --> 14:31.073
You see, that's what
I'm taking from that story.

14:36.314 --> 14:38.147
Leonard, can I ask you
a question?

14:38.149 --> 14:39.649
Is it about the
rotational symmetries

14:39.651 --> 14:40.817
you should be
figuring out

14:40.819 --> 14:42.418
or your fake
caffeine problem?

14:44.522 --> 14:47.623
Howard, can I ask you
a question?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.525
No.

14:50.662 --> 14:52.161
All right, I'll just
toss this out to the room.

14:52.163 --> 14:54.464
Um, I was thinking
that the best way

14:54.466 --> 14:56.199
to fight my addiction is by

14:56.201 --> 14:58.067
weaning myself off in steps.

14:58.069 --> 15:00.136
Now, I couldn't find
a caffeine patch,

15:00.138 --> 15:02.538
but I did find
what claims to be

15:02.540 --> 15:05.608
a mind-boosting
caffeine suppository.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.743
Yeah.

15:07.745 --> 15:09.779
You know, the interesting fact
about the rectum...

15:09.781 --> 15:11.414
Sheldon!

15:12.684 --> 15:15.084
We are dealing with
an impossible deadline

15:15.086 --> 15:16.652
from the Air Force
because of you.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.522
So have an energy drink,
don't have an energy drink.

15:19.524 --> 15:20.857
Order suppositories
and shove 'em

15:20.859 --> 15:23.392
wherever you want,
I don't care!

15:25.330 --> 15:26.329
You don't shove them.

15:26.331 --> 15:28.130
They come with an
easy-glide applicator.

15:30.902 --> 15:33.503
Right.
Listen to me.

15:33.505 --> 15:35.605
We can't do anything
until you do your part.

15:35.607 --> 15:38.174
So get up in front of
this whiteboard and do it!

15:38.176 --> 15:40.409
I can't.
Yes, you can.

15:40.411 --> 15:42.211
No...

15:42.213 --> 15:44.380
I can't figure out
the math.

15:44.382 --> 15:45.948
I've been racking
my brain for days,

15:45.950 --> 15:48.918
and I've got nothing.

15:49.988 --> 15:51.020
Seriously?

15:51.022 --> 15:52.622
I can't do it.

15:52.624 --> 15:54.724
I'm not as smart
as I think I am.

15:54.726 --> 15:58.261
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.733
It's okay, we'll
figure something out.

16:03.735 --> 16:06.536
But what if we can't?

16:06.538 --> 16:09.906
It'll be fine.
You'll see.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.246
Sheldon?

16:19.183 --> 16:21.951
Buddy?

16:21.953 --> 16:24.153
(snoring)

16:26.991 --> 16:28.424
When the baby gets here,

16:28.426 --> 16:31.060
you gotta teach me that.

16:34.165 --> 16:36.832
Thank you so much, Bert.
This was great.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.134
My pleasure.

16:38.136 --> 16:39.335
You girls want
to take home

16:39.337 --> 16:41.737
a two-gallon tub
of potato salad?

16:43.207 --> 16:45.741
I think we're good.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.543
Okay, well,
thanks for coming by.

16:47.545 --> 16:48.611
You're nice people.

16:48.613 --> 16:51.280
Well, so are you.
In fact, you know what?

16:51.282 --> 16:54.617
We will never
take you for granite.

16:54.619 --> 16:57.720
Did you get that?
<i>Granite?</i>

16:57.722 --> 17:00.590
A little geology joke.

17:00.592 --> 17:01.991
You need to leave.

17:01.993 --> 17:03.326
I'm in love
with both of you now.

17:03.328 --> 17:05.127
Okay.
Bye.

17:08.366 --> 17:10.232
Uh, pull over.

17:10.233 --> 17:11.968
What? Why?
Who are you calling?

17:11.970 --> 17:14.170
You're gonna rat me out
to Howard, aren't you?

17:14.172 --> 17:17.506
You're such a snitch,
no wonder I don't like you.

17:18.742 --> 17:21.743
Whoa, I'm calling
my dad, okay?

17:21.746 --> 17:23.980
He's got experience
dealing with pregnant ladies

17:23.982 --> 17:25.381
because he's an OBGYN.

17:25.383 --> 17:27.116
And experience
with crazy ladies

17:27.117 --> 17:28.451
because of my mom.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.753
(Facetime ringing)

17:30.755 --> 17:32.355
Hello, Rajesh.

17:32.357 --> 17:33.756
Are you calling
to ask for money?

17:33.758 --> 17:34.690
What? No.

17:34.692 --> 17:35.825
Are you calling to ask
for things

17:35.827 --> 17:37.893
that <i>cost</i> money?
No.

17:37.895 --> 17:39.862
Great. What's up?

17:39.864 --> 17:42.398
This is my friend,
Bernadette.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.600
She's pregnant,
and she's a bit worried,

17:44.602 --> 17:46.202
so I thought maybe
you could talk to her.

17:46.204 --> 17:48.771
Of course.
What seems to be the trouble?

17:48.773 --> 17:49.905
Something's wrong.

17:49.907 --> 17:52.208
I don't care about
any of the baby stuff

17:52.210 --> 17:54.610
every other mom is so into.

17:54.612 --> 17:57.980
Honestly, I'm not even sure
I <i>like</i> babies.

17:57.982 --> 17:59.982
Look, some people are
baby people,

17:59.984 --> 18:02.051
and some people
are not baby people.

18:02.053 --> 18:04.387
It doesn't mean you won't
love your own baby.

18:04.389 --> 18:07.089
But I thought I'd be
more excited.

18:07.091 --> 18:10.893
Oh, being excited
isn't a guarantee of anything.

18:10.895 --> 18:13.896
Rajesh's mother was thrilled
when she was pregnant with him.

18:13.898 --> 18:17.333
After he was born, she doted
on his every move.

18:17.335 --> 18:18.601
And you know what happened?

18:18.603 --> 18:20.803
He broke her heart,
moved halfway around the world,

18:20.805 --> 18:22.772
and dates only
poor white women.

18:25.643 --> 18:27.576
So you never know.

18:27.578 --> 18:30.513
Thank you.
I feel better now.

18:30.515 --> 18:32.615
I don't!
FATHER: Good.

18:32.617 --> 18:35.418
Bernadette, I hope
you have a daughter.

18:44.079 --> 18:47.580
Um, I don't really know
how to say this.

18:47.582 --> 18:49.249
Well, you could try
starting with "sir".

18:49.251 --> 18:51.251
Right. Sorry, sir.

18:51.253 --> 18:53.920
He said start with it,
not end with it.

18:55.524 --> 18:56.994
- Sir...
- Hmm?

18:56.995 --> 18:58.694
We've hit a bit
of a snag.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.630
We're already behind schedule.

19:01.633 --> 19:03.799
The computations required
to overcome

19:03.801 --> 19:05.201
the deployability issues

19:05.203 --> 19:07.537
are more significant
than we thought.

19:07.539 --> 19:09.572
I understand that
we're under contract,

19:09.574 --> 19:11.174
and I don't know what
the consequences

19:11.176 --> 19:13.242
of violating that are,
but, uh...

19:13.244 --> 19:15.745
we're not gonna
be able to deliver

19:15.747 --> 19:17.313
in the time we promised.

19:18.917 --> 19:20.816
(sighs)

19:24.022 --> 19:25.721
How long do you need?

19:25.723 --> 19:27.123
(Wolowitz clears throat)

19:27.125 --> 19:30.927
We-We're thinking...
two years.

19:33.698 --> 19:34.897
All right.

19:36.434 --> 19:38.000
(chuckles)
That's it?

19:38.002 --> 19:39.402
You're okay with that?

19:39.404 --> 19:41.871
(scoffs) You think you're
the first government contractor

19:41.873 --> 19:44.106
who isn't gonna deliver
on time?

19:44.108 --> 19:45.775
We're still waiting
for a big space laser

19:45.777 --> 19:48.578
Reagan ordered
to beat the commies.

19:50.215 --> 19:51.647
Thanks for understanding,
sir.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.349
Yes, thank you
so much.

19:53.351 --> 19:55.618
We-We really
