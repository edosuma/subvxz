00:21.952 --> 00:24.493
The war is over.
Winter has come.

00:24.785 --> 00:26.201
The war is not over.

00:26.202 --> 00:28.492
The true enemy won't
wait out the storm.

00:30.286 --> 00:33.492
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:38.368 --> 00:41.577
Our uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

00:44.952 --> 00:47.576
He murdered our father,
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

00:47.577 --> 00:49.177
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

00:49.327 --> 00:53.202
Build me a thousand ships,
and I will give you this world.

00:55.327 --> 00:56.534
There's a storm coming.

00:56.535 --> 00:58.077
You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.

00:58.535 --> 01:01.367
I don't have much, but I have
hidden a bit of silver

01:01.368 --> 01:03.493
from the bandits.

01:03.702 --> 01:05.035
What did you do?!

01:05.036 --> 01:06.493
They'll both be dead
come winter.

01:07.618 --> 01:09.534
Cold winds
are rising in the North.

01:09.535 --> 01:11.201
We need good men to help us.

01:11.202 --> 01:14.409
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.036
It's not too late for you.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.743
Send me to Oldtown.

01:18.744 --> 01:20.452
I'm to be the new maester.

01:21.702 --> 01:24.118
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

01:24.119 --> 01:26.576
I'll learn about things
that all help when...

01:28.077 --> 01:29.367
...when they come.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.577
Let go of me!

01:42.785 --> 01:44.827
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

01:45.202 --> 01:49.161
I'm the three-eyed raven.
I have to be ready for this.

01:51.327 --> 01:54.036
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.244
Aegon Targaryen.

01:55.952 --> 01:58.826
Aegon used to live here, and the
Targaryens built this castle.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.107
Aye. So they did.

02:00.535 --> 02:03.577
I want us both to go home.
But they took it from us.

02:03.785 --> 02:05.244
How do we go home?

02:05.869 --> 02:07.709
You're in the great game now,

02:07.910 --> 02:11.577
and the great game's
terrifying. Are you afraid?

02:13.535 --> 02:16.826
My name is Arya Stark.
I want you to know that.

02:57.618 --> 03:01.409
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.868
After all, we just had a feast.

03:04.869 --> 03:07.826
Since when does old Walder

03:07.827 --> 03:10.826
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

03:13.327 --> 03:16.285
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

03:16.286 --> 03:18.659
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.160
That's what I say!

03:20.161 --> 03:23.576
Yes!

03:27.452 --> 03:31.326
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

03:31.327 --> 03:36.659
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

03:36.660 --> 03:39.534
now that winter has come.

03:39.535 --> 03:42.702
But first, a toast!

03:44.244 --> 03:47.951
No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

03:47.952 --> 03:50.909
This is the finest Arbor gold!

03:50.910 --> 03:53.909
Proper wine for proper heroes!

03:59.077 --> 04:01.285
Stand together!

04:01.286 --> 04:03.535
Stand together!

04:12.286 --> 04:13.701
Not you.

04:13.702 --> 04:16.618
I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

04:20.286 --> 04:24.659
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.076
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

04:28.077 --> 04:31.201
You're my family,
the men who helped me

04:31.202 --> 04:34.243
slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

04:34.244 --> 04:38.367
Yes, yes.

04:38.368 --> 04:41.035
Cheer.

04:41.036 --> 04:44.367
Brave men, all of you.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.951
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

04:47.952 --> 04:53.784
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

04:53.785 --> 04:56.909
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

04:56.910 --> 04:58.660
into your home.

05:00.327 --> 05:05.951
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

05:05.952 --> 05:10.701
No, no, that was your mistake.

05:10.702 --> 05:14.576
You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

05:21.119 --> 05:23.451
Leave one wolf alive

05:23.452 --> 05:26.119
and the sheep are never safe.

05:51.744 --> 05:54.036
When people ask you
what happened here...

05:55.327 --> 05:57.327
tell them the North remembers.

05:58.660 --> 06:02.660
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

10:25.077 --> 10:26.868
You wildlings?

10:26.869 --> 10:29.785
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

10:31.827 --> 10:33.285
This is Brandon Stark,

10:33.286 --> 10:35.493
son of Ned Stark.

10:39.702 --> 10:41.327
How do I know that's true?

10:44.493 --> 10:47.826
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

10:47.827 --> 10:49.286
You were at Hardhome.

10:51.452 --> 10:53.161
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

10:55.036 --> 10:56.410
You've seen the Night King.

10:57.493 --> 10:59.493
He's coming for us.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.827
For all of us.

11:09.827 --> 11:11.576
Okay, come on.

11:11.577 --> 11:13.660
Let's get them inside.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.951
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

11:45.952 --> 11:49.118
for any mention of dragonglass.

11:49.119 --> 11:51.201
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

11:51.202 --> 11:53.868
It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

11:53.869 --> 11:55.534
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

11:55.535 --> 11:57.244
we need to make weapons from it.

11:58.577 --> 12:01.576
Everyone aged 10 to 60

12:01.577 --> 12:04.826
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

12:04.827 --> 12:08.035
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

12:08.036 --> 12:10.326
Not just the boys.

12:10.327 --> 12:12.826
We can't defend the North

12:12.827 --> 12:14.993
if only half the
population is fighting.

12:14.994 --> 12:19.701
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

12:19.702 --> 12:23.367
I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

12:23.368 --> 12:26.451
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

12:26.452 --> 12:28.909
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.784
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

12:30.785 --> 12:32.910
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

12:35.827 --> 12:40.659
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.743
Aye!

12:42.744 --> 12:44.243
While we're
preparing for attack,

12:44.244 --> 12:46.576
we need to shore up
our defenses.

12:46.577 --> 12:50.076
The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

12:50.077 --> 12:53.993
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

12:53.994 --> 12:56.410
I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

12:57.952 --> 13:00.285
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

13:01.827 --> 13:04.492
You want us to man
the castles for you?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.076
Aye.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.909
Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

13:08.910 --> 13:12.243
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.784
Then that's where I'll go.

13:13.785 --> 13:16.951
Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

13:19.327 --> 13:20.826
If they breach the Wall,

13:20.827 --> 13:22.367
the first two castles
in their path

13:22.368 --> 13:24.909
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

13:24.910 --> 13:28.576
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

13:28.577 --> 13:30.201
Their castles
should be torn down

13:30.202 --> 13:31.951
with not a stone left standing.

13:31.952 --> 13:34.534
The castles committed no crimes.

13:34.535 --> 13:37.951
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

13:37.952 --> 13:41.285
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

13:41.286 --> 13:43.826
loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

13:43.827 --> 13:47.035
Aye!

13:47.036 --> 13:49.326
The Umbers and the Karstarks

13:49.327 --> 13:51.826
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

13:51.827 --> 13:55.993
- They've kept faith for generation after generation.
- And then they broke faith.

13:55.994 --> 13:59.076
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

13:59.077 --> 14:01.659
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.326
So there's no
punishment for treason

14:03.327 --> 14:05.827
and no reward for loyalty?

14:10.994 --> 14:13.659
The punishment
for treason is death.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.492
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

14:16.493 --> 14:19.326
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

14:19.327 --> 14:21.743
They died fighting for Ramsay.

14:21.744 --> 14:23.326
Give the castles to the families

14:23.327 --> 14:25.701
of the men who died
fighting for you.

14:38.910 --> 14:41.827
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

14:43.327 --> 14:45.659
I executed men who betrayed me.

14:45.660 --> 14:49.909
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.701
My father always said,

14:51.702 --> 14:54.285
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

14:54.286 --> 14:57.576
and I have tried
to live by those words.

14:57.577 --> 15:01.035
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

15:01.036 --> 15:03.492
and I will not take
a family home away

15:03.493 --> 15:06.868
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

15:06.869 --> 15:09.451
That is my decision,

15:09.452 --> 15:12.036
and my decision is final.

15:18.244 --> 15:19.244
Ned Umber.

15:27.244 --> 15:28.577
Alys Karstark.

15:43.535 --> 15:45.409
For centuries,
our families fought

15:45.410 --> 15:48.243
side by side on the battlefield.

15:48.244 --> 15:53.243
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.784
to serve as our bannermen

15:55.785 --> 15:58.493
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

16:07.286 --> 16:08.410
Stand.

16:12.119 --> 16:14.909
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

16:14.910 --> 16:17.909
The North needs
to band together,

16:17.910 --> 16:19.286
all the living north.

16:20.618 --> 16:22.951
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

16:22.952 --> 16:25.201
now and always?

16:25.202 --> 16:27.659
Now and always!

16:46.785 --> 16:49.035
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

16:49.036 --> 16:50.659
Will you start wearing a crown?

16:50.660 --> 16:52.285
When you question my decisions

16:52.286 --> 16:54.451
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

16:54.452 --> 16:57.160
- So I can't question your decisions anymore?
- Of course you can, but...

16:57.161 --> 16:59.492
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

16:59.493 --> 17:01.493
You think he was a good king?

17:03.161 --> 17:05.118
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

17:08.743 --> 17:11.659
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.161
Thank you.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.867
You're good at this, you know.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.326
- At what?
- At ruling.

17:19.327 --> 17:21.160
No.

17:21.161 --> 17:22.161
You are.

17:23.202 --> 17:24.660
You are.

17:26.077 --> 17:28.451
They respect you,
they really do,

17:28.452 --> 17:30.617
but you have to...

17:30.618 --> 17:32.035
Why are you laughing?

17:32.036 --> 17:34.201
What did father used to say?

17:34.202 --> 17:37.534
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

17:37.535 --> 17:39.035
He never said that to me.

17:39.036 --> 17:41.743
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

17:41.744 --> 17:44.826
Because he was
trying to protect us.

17:44.827 --> 17:47.826
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

17:47.827 --> 17:50.534
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

17:50.535 --> 17:53.243
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

17:53.244 --> 17:54.617
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

17:54.618 --> 17:56.827
I'm not trying to undermine you!

17:58.368 --> 18:01.409
You have to be
smarter than Father.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.076
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

18:04.077 --> 18:07.201
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

18:07.202 --> 18:09.243
and they both
lost their heads for it.

18:09.244 --> 18:11.451
And how should I be smarter?

18:11.452 --> 18:12.910
By listening to you?

18:15.036 --> 18:18.243
Would that be so terrible?

18:18.244 --> 18:21.202
A raven from King's
Landing, Your Grace.

18:30.202 --> 18:33.243
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

18:33.244 --> 18:35.160
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

18:35.161 --> 18:36.784
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

18:36.785 --> 18:38.244
What does she want?

18:39.493 --> 18:42.285
Come to King's Landing.

18:42.286 --> 18:46.118
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

18:46.119 --> 18:48.243
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

18:48.244 --> 18:50.076
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

18:50.077 --> 18:53.118
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

18:53.119 --> 18:55.743
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

18:55.744 --> 18:57.451
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

18:57.452 --> 18:59.285
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

18:59.286 --> 19:02.201
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

19:02.202 --> 19:04.993
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

19:04.994 --> 19:06.451
They've never ranged
this far north.

19:06.452 --> 19:09.784
You're the military man,
but I know her.

19:09.785 --> 19:13.118
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.286
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.452
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

19:25.077 --> 19:27.286
I learned a great deal from her.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.993
What is this?

20:05.994 --> 20:08.659
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

20:08.660 --> 20:11.451
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

20:11.452 --> 20:12.951
He knew it.

20:12.952 --> 20:14.909
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

20:14.910 --> 20:16.492
lake, forest, and mountain.

20:16.493 --> 20:18.660
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

20:20.202 --> 20:22.534
You've been quiet
since you came home.

20:22.535 --> 20:23.993
Are you angry with me?

20:23.994 --> 20:26.244
No, not angry.

20:27.368 --> 20:28.368
Are you afraid of me?

20:30.368 --> 20:31.493
Should I be?

20:35.286 --> 20:39.201
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

20:39.202 --> 20:41.993
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

20:41.994 --> 20:44.993
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.409
Our little brother,

20:47.410 --> 20:49.576
the one you love so much,

20:49.577 --> 20:51.409
the one you set free,

20:51.410 --> 20:54.701
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

20:54.702 --> 20:58.036
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

21:01.744 --> 21:05.743
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

21:05.744 --> 21:07.452
Where will they land?

21:10.244 --> 21:11.576
Dragonstone.

21:11.577 --> 21:14.367
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

21:14.368 --> 21:16.367
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

21:16.368 --> 21:17.826
and that's where she was born.

21:17.827 --> 21:20.118
Enemies to the east.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.909
Enemies to the south...

21:21.910 --> 21:24.909
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.743
Enemies to the west...

21:26.744 --> 21:28.576
Olenna, the old cunt.

21:28.577 --> 21:31.784
Another traitor.

21:31.785 --> 21:33.951
Enemies to the north.

21:33.952 --> 21:37.076
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

21:37.077 --> 21:40.076
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

21:40.077 --> 21:42.743
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.451
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

21:44.452 --> 21:47.576
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

21:47.577 --> 21:50.868
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

21:50.869 --> 21:55.035
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

21:55.036 --> 21:57.076
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

21:57.077 --> 22:00.367
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

22:00.368 --> 22:03.035
If they think Daenerys will win.

22:03.036 --> 22:04.993
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

22:04.994 --> 22:08.119
Right now, we look
like the losing side.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.243
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

22:11.244 --> 22:13.993
Three kingdoms, at best.

22:13.994 --> 22:16.534
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.326
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

22:18.327 --> 22:21.367
I understand whoever loses dies.

22:21.368 --> 22:23.659
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

22:23.660 --> 22:25.243
that lasts a thousand years.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.826
A dynasty for whom?

22:27.827 --> 22:30.826
Our children are dead.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.285
We're the last of us.

22:32.286 --> 22:34.327
A dynasty for us, then.

22:37.493 --> 22:39.036
We never talked about Tommen.

22:42.036 --> 22:43.993
There's nothing to say.

22:43.994 --> 22:45.951
Our baby boy killed himself.

22:45.952 --> 22:47.492
He betrayed me.

22:47.493 --> 22:48.993
He betrayed us both.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.826
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

22:50.827 --> 22:52.243
Mother, father,
and all our children?

22:52.244 --> 22:54.826
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

22:54.827 --> 22:58.035
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

22:58.036 --> 23:01.036
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

23:06.869 --> 23:09.534
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

23:09.535 --> 23:12.701
Where are our allies now?

23:12.702 --> 23:14.909
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.576
I heard.

23:16.577 --> 23:19.118
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

23:19.119 --> 23:21.118
He was a useless, old coward,

23:21.119 --> 23:22.951
but the Freys supported us.

23:22.952 --> 23:24.326
Now they're all dead.

23:24.327 --> 23:26.035
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

23:26.036 --> 23:27.576
We need allies.

23:27.577 --> 23:29.367
Stronger, better allies.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.493
We can't win this war alone.

23:33.493 --> 23:37.119
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.617
The Greyjoys?

24:15.618 --> 24:18.201
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

24:18.202 --> 24:21.035
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

24:21.036 --> 24:22.617
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

24:22.618 --> 24:25.118
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

24:25.119 --> 24:27.826
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

24:27.827 --> 24:30.951
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

24:30.952 --> 24:33.367
How are they different
from the Freys?

24:33.368 --> 24:34.951
They both broke their promises

24:34.952 --> 24:37.243
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

24:37.244 --> 24:40.243
So does everyone
when it suits them.

24:40.244 --> 24:42.868
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

24:42.869 --> 24:45.492
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

24:45.493 --> 24:48.909
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

24:48.910 --> 24:52.118
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

24:52.119 --> 24:54.243
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.285
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.952
A queen.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.868
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

25:13.869 --> 25:16.243
they turned on me.

25:16.244 --> 25:17.492
Their own uncle.

25:17.493 --> 25:20.118
They stole
my best ships and ran.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.285
Sailed them
right across the world

25:22.286 --> 25:24.576
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

25:24.577 --> 25:28.035
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

25:28.036 --> 25:31.492
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

25:31.493 --> 25:35.160
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

25:35.161 --> 25:37.869
But still, it bothers me.

25:39.493 --> 25:42.534
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

25:42.535 --> 25:46.701
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

25:46.702 --> 25:48.617
are fighting for the same side,

25:48.618 --> 25:51.160
I thought we rightful monarchs

25:51.161 --> 25:53.744
could murder them together.

25:59.744 --> 26:02.535
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

26:06.660 --> 26:09.659
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

26:09.660 --> 26:13.701
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.534
Come to mention it,

26:15.535 --> 26:17.909
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

26:17.910 --> 26:22.118
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

26:22.119 --> 26:23.826
You certainly caught us there.

26:23.827 --> 26:26.659
Very smart move on your part.

26:26.660 --> 26:30.909
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

26:30.910 --> 26:32.118
I was there.

26:32.119 --> 26:33.951
I remember very well.

26:33.952 --> 26:35.492
I saw you.

26:35.493 --> 26:37.784
I heard so much talk.

26:37.785 --> 26:41.409
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

26:41.410 --> 26:43.118
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

26:43.119 --> 26:46.409
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

26:46.410 --> 26:48.577
and started
cutting people down...

26:52.077 --> 26:53.784
it was glorious.

26:53.785 --> 26:55.201
Like a dance.

26:55.202 --> 26:58.409
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.743
The place was getting crowded.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.326
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

27:03.327 --> 27:05.534
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

27:05.535 --> 27:07.993
A good thing for me.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.617
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

27:11.618 --> 27:13.534
If I hadn't done that,

27:13.535 --> 27:17.119
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

27:18.161 --> 27:19.994
If not the most humble.

27:21.286 --> 27:22.286
You're not humble.

27:24.244 --> 27:26.244
You're the queen
of a great nation.

27:27.535 --> 27:29.201
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

27:29.202 --> 27:33.868
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

27:33.869 --> 27:36.743
And a lot of very
unattractive people.

27:36.744 --> 27:39.367
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

27:39.368 --> 27:42.492
that's something else entirely.

27:42.493 --> 27:45.784
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

27:45.785 --> 27:50.367
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.201
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

27:53.202 --> 27:56.160
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

27:56.161 --> 27:57.785
What do you want in return?

27:59.869 --> 28:02.909
Ever since I was a little boy,

28:02.910 --> 28:04.826
I wanted to grow up and marry

28:04.827 --> 28:06.951
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

28:06.952 --> 28:09.659
So here I am,

28:09.660 --> 28:12.118
with a thousand ships

28:12.119 --> 28:13.660
and two good hands.

28:19.077 --> 28:20.660
I decline your proposal.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.201
Why?

28:24.202 --> 28:25.869
You're not trustworthy.

28:27.286 --> 28:29.367
You've broken promises
to allies before

28:29.368 --> 28:31.826
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

28:31.827 --> 28:33.368
You murdered your own brother.

28:34.702 --> 28:37.035
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.701
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

28:40.702 --> 28:43.076
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

28:43.077 --> 28:44.534
In my experience,

28:44.535 --> 28:47.534
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

28:47.535 --> 28:49.826
A priceless gift.

28:49.827 --> 28:51.701
I won't return to King's Landing

28:51.702 --> 28:53.744
until I have that for you.

31:59.744 --> 32:02.576
Ah, Maester Weyland.

32:02.577 --> 32:06.077
A drinker's
liver if ever I saw one.

32:07.327 --> 32:08.327
Weigh that.

32:09.493 --> 32:12.784
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

32:12.785 --> 32:14.701
Mankind's curse.

32:14.702 --> 32:17.784
Archmaester, I was wondering...

32:17.785 --> 32:19.743
What's the weight?

32:19.744 --> 32:22.702
Um, 147.

32:25.618 --> 32:28.701
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

32:28.702 --> 32:31.784
I don't remember
your proposition.

32:31.785 --> 32:35.076
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

32:35.077 --> 32:38.243
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

32:38.244 --> 32:39.951
That area is reserved
for maesters.

32:39.952 --> 32:42.451
- Are you a maester?
- No.

32:42.452 --> 32:44.577
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

32:53.869 --> 32:56.534
Archmaester, with respect,

32:56.535 --> 32:58.367
I've seen them...

32:58.368 --> 33:00.617
The Army of the Dead.

33:00.618 --> 33:02.993
The white walkers.

33:02.994 --> 33:05.492
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

33:05.493 --> 33:08.035
but everyone in the Citadel,

33:08.036 --> 33:10.201
those who will even talk to me,

33:10.202 --> 33:13.035
they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

33:13.036 --> 33:15.576
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.660
It's their job.

33:22.202 --> 33:25.493
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

33:27.327 --> 33:30.243
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

33:30.244 --> 33:32.826
Sources in the restricted area?

33:32.827 --> 33:34.452
The very same.

33:35.744 --> 33:37.201
And the simplest explanation

33:37.202 --> 33:40.160
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

33:40.161 --> 33:41.659
is that you're telling the truth

33:41.660 --> 33:44.784
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

33:44.785 --> 33:47.660
So, you believe me.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.492
I do.

33:50.493 --> 33:52.202
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

33:54.493 --> 33:57.327
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

34:00.368 --> 34:03.201
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

34:03.202 --> 34:05.410
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

34:07.744 --> 34:11.659
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

34:13.534 --> 34:16.326
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

34:16.327 --> 34:19.284
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

34:19.286 --> 34:21.451
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

34:21.452 --> 34:24.118
can't see forward
to any but the next.

34:24.119 --> 34:26.284
And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

34:26.286 --> 34:29.201
they howl like
you're gone forever.

34:29.202 --> 34:32.201
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

34:32.202 --> 34:34.034
people thought the end was near.

34:34.036 --> 34:37.118
The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

34:37.119 --> 34:40.576
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

34:40.577 --> 34:42.534
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

34:42.534 --> 34:44.576
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

34:44.577 --> 34:47.451
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

34:47.452 --> 34:49.576
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

34:49.577 --> 34:52.286
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

34:54.077 --> 34:56.618
The Wall has stood
through it all.

34:57.910 --> 35:00.869
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

35:09.077 --> 35:11.244
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

36:01.036 --> 36:02.744
Nope.

36:13.827 --> 36:14.869
Nope.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.327
You're a lucky man.

36:33.785 --> 36:36.660
I've heard she
beat the Hound in single combat.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.952
She's a very impressive woman.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.493
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

36:49.869 --> 36:51.868
I want you to be happy.

36:51.869 --> 36:54.243
I want you to be safe.

36:54.244 --> 36:55.534
I am safe.

36:55.535 --> 36:58.701
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

36:58.702 --> 37:02.077
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

37:05.952 --> 37:07.744
What about happy?

37:10.410 --> 37:12.243
Why aren't you happy?

37:12.244 --> 37:14.201
What do you want
that you do not have?

37:14.202 --> 37:16.951
At the moment, peace and quiet.

37:22.119 --> 37:25.243
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.618
I'll assume it was
something clever.

37:29.869 --> 37:31.451
My lady.

37:31.452 --> 37:33.244
My lady.

37:43.744 --> 37:45.285
Why is he still here?

37:45.286 --> 37:48.035
We need his men.

37:48.036 --> 37:51.618
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

37:53.077 --> 37:54.618
Littlefinger saved us.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.410
He wants something.

38:02.202 --> 38:04.535
I know exactly what he wants.

38:09.660 --> 38:13.285
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

38:13.286 --> 38:16.326
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

38:16.327 --> 38:19.909
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

38:19.910 --> 38:23.409
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

38:23.410 --> 38:26.617
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

38:26.618 --> 38:30.035
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

38:30.036 --> 38:32.951
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

38:32.952 --> 38:35.617
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

38:35.618 --> 38:39.118
♪ For hands of
gold are always cold ♪

38:39.119 --> 38:41.784
♪ But a woman's hands
are warm ♪

38:41.785 --> 38:45.617
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

38:45.618 --> 38:48.618
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

38:49.910 --> 38:51.367
That's a pretty song.

38:51.368 --> 38:52.451
I've never heard it before.

38:52.452 --> 38:53.909
It's a new one.

38:53.910 --> 38:56.909
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.367
I don't want to steal your food.

38:58.368 --> 39:00.743
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

39:00.744 --> 39:03.119
Come on, it's gonna
be a cold night.

39:31.618 --> 39:33.118
You heading south?

39:33.119 --> 39:35.201
King's Landing.

39:35.202 --> 39:37.285
Poor girl.

39:37.286 --> 39:39.951
Not so bad, is it?

39:39.952 --> 39:42.076
Depends on your taste, I guess.

39:42.077 --> 39:45.367
If you like your streets covered in shit
and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

39:45.368 --> 39:48.201
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep,

39:48.202 --> 39:50.367
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

39:50.368 --> 39:52.326
Then when I finally make it,

39:52.327 --> 39:54.534
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

39:54.535 --> 39:56.492
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

39:56.493 --> 39:58.451
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

39:58.452 --> 40:00.326
The people who live there,

40:00.327 --> 40:03.035
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

40:03.036 --> 40:05.160
Worst place in the world.

40:05.161 --> 40:07.534
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

40:07.535 --> 40:10.118
There's been some trouble with
the Freys up at the Twins,

40:10.119 --> 40:13.452
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

40:16.535 --> 40:19.367
Here you go.
Guests first.

40:19.368 --> 40:21.492
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

40:21.493 --> 40:23.951
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

40:23.952 --> 40:25.910
Strangers will be kind to you.

40:38.410 --> 40:40.492
You're a long way from home.

40:40.493 --> 40:42.576
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

40:42.577 --> 40:45.409
Yeah, endless adventures.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.076
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

40:48.077 --> 40:51.743
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

40:51.744 --> 40:54.076
But now we've been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

40:54.077 --> 40:58.118
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

40:58.119 --> 40:59.493
I ought to be
out there with him.

41:01.618 --> 41:03.451
My wife just had our first baby.

41:03.452 --> 41:05.743
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

41:05.744 --> 41:07.909
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

41:11.702 --> 41:14.367
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

41:14.368 --> 41:17.326
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

41:17.327 --> 41:19.327
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

41:22.161 --> 41:23.910
Are you old
enough to drink?

41:39.368 --> 41:41.243
It's blackberry wine.

41:41.244 --> 41:42.535
I made it myself.

41:43.994 --> 41:45.119
It's really good.

41:47.244 --> 41:50.618
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

41:58.161 --> 42:00.161
I'm going to kill the queen.

42:21.618 --> 42:23.534
Bad night
to be outdoors.

42:23.535 --> 42:26.367
You've got real
powerful magic to figure that out.

42:26.368 --> 42:30.451
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

42:30.452 --> 42:33.617
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

42:33.618 --> 42:36.576
It's gonna be
a cold night."

42:36.577 --> 42:40.451
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

42:40.452 --> 42:42.118
You want some rum?

42:42.119 --> 42:45.201
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

42:45.202 --> 42:47.244
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

42:49.410 --> 42:51.535
Experience.

42:55.702 --> 42:57.994
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.076
These people don't want us here.

43:03.077 --> 43:05.993
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

43:05.994 --> 43:07.952
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

43:27.493 --> 43:28.909
I don't like the look of it.

43:28.910 --> 43:31.909
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

43:31.910 --> 43:34.534
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me...

43:34.535 --> 43:36.534
Bald cocksuckers like you.

43:36.535 --> 43:39.409
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

43:39.410 --> 43:41.202
Bald cunt.

43:43.286 --> 43:44.826
Come on.

43:44.827 --> 43:46.660
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

43:48.327 --> 43:49.784
They don't.

43:52.702 --> 43:54.367
See if there's a larder.

43:54.368 --> 43:56.077
They always leave
something behind.

44:37.744 --> 44:39.104
How do you think
it ended for them?

44:40.660 --> 44:41.868
With death.

44:41.869 --> 44:44.826
Girl died in her father's arms.

44:44.827 --> 44:47.660
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

44:50.161 --> 44:51.784
I'd say they were starving.

44:51.785 --> 44:53.701
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

44:53.702 --> 44:55.659
he ended it for both of them.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.909
Doesn't matter now.

44:57.910 --> 45:00.702
No, doesn't matter now.

45:14.452 --> 45:16.868
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

45:16.869 --> 45:18.367
Aye.

45:18.368 --> 45:22.451
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament...

45:22.452 --> 45:25.701
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

45:27.036 --> 45:28.784
You're not bad.

45:28.785 --> 45:30.160
I don't hate you.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.534
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

45:32.535 --> 45:34.367
Thank you, Clegane.

45:34.368 --> 45:35.701
That warms the heart.

45:35.702 --> 45:38.367
But there's nothing
special about you.

45:38.368 --> 45:40.201
You're right about that.

45:40.202 --> 45:43.660
So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

45:44.952 --> 45:47.035
I've met better men than you,

45:47.036 --> 45:51.951
and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

45:51.952 --> 45:56.826
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

45:56.827 --> 45:59.909
None of them came back.

45:59.910 --> 46:01.492
So, why you?

46:01.493 --> 46:04.409
You think I don't
ask myself that?

46:04.410 --> 46:07.576
Every hour of every day?

46:07.577 --> 46:09.244
Why am I here?

46:10.618 --> 46:12.409
What am I supposed to do?

46:12.410 --> 46:14.202
What does the Lord see in me?

46:16.202 --> 46:17.535
And?

46:19.244 --> 46:21.909
I don't know.

46:21.910 --> 46:23.909
I don't understand our Lord.

46:23.910 --> 46:25.743
Your Lord.

46:25.744 --> 46:27.534
I don't know
what He wants from me.

46:27.535 --> 46:32.035
I only know that
He wants me alive.

46:32.036 --> 46:36.327
If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

46:38.410 --> 46:40.201
Clegane.

46:40.202 --> 46:41.577
Come over here.

46:44.244 --> 46:45.952
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

46:47.452 --> 46:50.243
I want to show you something.

46:50.244 --> 46:53.452
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

46:54.618 --> 46:55.951
Aye.

46:55.952 --> 46:58.285
Almost seems like
divine justice.

46:58.286 --> 47:00.826
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

47:00.827 --> 47:03.951
If there was, you'd be dead...

47:03.952 --> 47:06.119
and that girl would be alive.

47:12.493 --> 47:15.326
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

47:15.327 --> 47:17.451
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

47:17.452 --> 47:20.994
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

47:22.618 --> 47:24.868
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

47:24.869 --> 47:28.326
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

47:28.327 --> 47:29.826
We can't tell you.

47:29.827 --> 47:31.994
Only the fire can tell you.

47:44.577 --> 47:46.036
What do you see?

47:47.785 --> 47:49.243
Logs burning.

47:49.244 --> 47:51.327
Keep looking.

47:56.994 --> 47:58.202
What do you see?

48:07.702 --> 48:10.409
Ice.

48:10.410 --> 48:12.327
A wall of ice.

48:14.744 --> 48:15.744
The Wall.

48:18.535 --> 48:19.784
What else?

48:19.785 --> 48:23.994
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

48:25.202 --> 48:27.410
There's a castle there.

48:34.827 --> 48:36.326
There's a mountain.

48:36.327 --> 48:39.785
Looks like an arrowhead.

48:42.410 --> 48:44.577
The dead are marching past.

48:49.535 --> 48:51.368
Thousands of them.

48:57.493 --> 48:58.910
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

49:00.535 --> 49:02.535
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

49:34.202 --> 49:35.785
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

49:39.202 --> 49:40.785
Burying the dead.

49:53.869 --> 49:55.993
You knew these people.

49:55.994 --> 49:57.493
Not really.

50:57.994 --> 51:01.826
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

51:01.827 --> 51:04.869
We ask the Mother to...

51:07.702 --> 51:09.869
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

51:16.410 --> 51:19.367
I'm sorry you're dead.

51:19.368 --> 51:22.285
You deserved better.

51:22.286 --> 51:23.286
Both of you.

51:47.244 --> 51:48.909
Hey.

51:54.077 --> 51:55.492
Mom.

51:55.493 --> 51:57.244
You should really sleep, Sam.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.244
The dead don't.

52:09.452 --> 52:12.618
"Legends of the Long Night."

52:14.368 --> 52:17.617
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

52:17.618 --> 52:20.161
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

52:37.452 --> 52:38.452
What is it?

52:40.244 --> 52:42.201
It's a map of Dragonstone.

52:42.202 --> 52:44.492
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

52:44.493 --> 52:46.286
when they invaded Westeros.

52:48.994 --> 52:50.743
That's dragonglass?

52:50.744 --> 52:52.492
A mountain of it.

52:52.493 --> 52:53.659
Beneath the ground.

52:53.660 --> 52:55.993
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

52:55.994 --> 52:59.493
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

53:52.785 --> 53:54.868
Has she come yet?

53:54.869 --> 53:56.492
Who?

53:56.493 --> 53:58.701
The Dragon Queen.

53:58.702 --> 54:00.660
Daenerys Stormborn.

54:02.368 --> 54:03.577
Haven't heard anything.

59:43.660 --> 59:45.576
Shall we begin?

01:01:06.869 --> 01:01:08.660
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

01:01:09.827 --> 01:01:12.409
The Mad King's
daughter will destroy the realm.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.161
We have an army
of fleets and three dragons.

01:01:15.785 --> 01:01:17.660
We should hit
King's Landing now.
