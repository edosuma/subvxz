Bartokomous,
I’ve been looking for you.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.392
Well, congratulations,
Mr. Wainwright.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.827
You found me.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.762
Now, you want to hide
and I’ll look for you?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.531
‐No, no.
‐Go ahead.

01:38.464 --> 01:39.533
Bartokomous!

01:41.334 --> 01:43.369
I want to talk to you
about the sheep cartoon

01:43.403 --> 01:44.671
you draw
for the company newsletter.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.206
You know, "Dimitri’s World."

01:46.239 --> 01:47.608
Oh, I’m sorry
about that thumb smudge

01:47.641 --> 01:48.909
on Dimitri’s cheek.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.245
I, I had a brownie
while I was drawing.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.847
I never noticed it.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.749
I’m dropping
"Kangaroo Cowboy"

01:55.782 --> 01:57.751
from the cartoon page
of the "Chronicle"

01:57.784 --> 02:00.420
and I want to replace it
with "Dimitri’s World"

02:00.453 --> 02:02.455
and I want you to draw it.

02:02.488 --> 02:04.691
Thank you, Mr. Wainwright.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.694
I promise you, you will
never live to regret this.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.401
Yes, well, uh...

02:15.435 --> 02:16.469
You know, you do
a pretty good job

02:16.503 --> 02:17.571
drawing this little sheep.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.339
Hey, do you want to see

02:19.372 --> 02:20.674
an unpublished
"Dimitri’s World?"

02:20.707 --> 02:22.543
‐Well, I‐‐
‐Come on!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.545
Come on! Come over here.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.447
This my secret drawer.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.217
Now, look, this is one of my
particular favorite cartoons.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.654
Um, in the, in the first one

02:33.687 --> 02:35.622
Dimitri standing
at the street corner

02:35.656 --> 02:37.558
looking across the street
at one of them lights

02:37.591 --> 02:40.193
that says
"Don’t walk" and "Walk."

02:40.226 --> 02:41.928
And then...

02:41.962 --> 02:45.298
And then the really
funny part comes

02:45.331 --> 02:47.934
here at the end
where we realize

02:47.968 --> 02:51.738
that Dimitri is too short
to push the button.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.740
[laughing]

02:55.509 --> 02:56.977
He’s just...

02:57.010 --> 02:58.812
He’s too short
to push the button.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.714
[mumbling]

03:02.315 --> 03:04.985
Well, as much as
I like your cartoon, Bartokomous

03:05.018 --> 03:06.853
I think we should seek the input

03:06.887 --> 03:09.255
of a good writer
to help you with the words.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.693
Now, what we need is a writer
with a unique talent.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.394
’I’m not sure anyone
here at the "Chronicle"’

03:14.427 --> 03:15.929
’fills the bill.’

03:15.962 --> 03:17.497
I could! I could do it, sir!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.932
I could be unique!

03:18.965 --> 03:21.635
I‐I have a file
full of‐of unique articles.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.806
There is no job too big
for Larry Appleton.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.575
The "Chronicle" is my life, sir.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.611
You may be right, Appleton.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.746
I can’t picture you
having a life away from here.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.349
Alright, you’ve got the job.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.283
Oh, thank you, sir!

03:37.317 --> 03:38.819
Thank you, and I will not
let you down, sir.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.453
I’ve never let you
down in the past.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.522
Well, I have let you down
in the past

03:41.555 --> 03:42.723
but it’s always
worked out for the best, sir.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.657
‐’Appleton.’
‐Yes, sir.

03:43.690 --> 03:47.493
‐You’re babbling.
‐Like a brook, sir!

03:47.528 --> 03:49.796

03:49.830 --> 03:51.464
Fill in the bubbles, sir?

03:51.497 --> 03:53.499
I want you to help Bartokomous

03:53.534 --> 03:54.901
write his Dimitri cartoon.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.837
If I like it,
I’ll put "Dimitri’s World"

03:56.870 --> 03:58.338
on the children’s page
of the "Chronicle"

03:58.371 --> 04:00.306
a week from Sunday.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.846
I’m writing a cartoon?

04:05.879 --> 04:07.514
Cousin, this
the most exciting thing

04:07.548 --> 04:09.282
that ever happened to me.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.017
I’m going to be sharing
Dimitri with the world.

04:11.051 --> 04:11.952
And I’m going to be doing it

04:11.985 --> 04:13.887

in the whole world.

‐Yes, Miss Lydia?
‐Uh, do you have my mail?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.537
Oh, I’m sorry, Miss Lydia.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.873
In all the excitement
I forgot to bring you your mail

04:32.906 --> 04:35.942
but don’t worry because I can
always bring you to your mail.

‐Oh, thank you.

Well, you see, my, my little
cartoon, "Dimitri’s World"

04:45.619 --> 04:48.054
is going to be moving
from the company newsletter

04:48.088 --> 04:49.956
to the "Chronicle"
and I am going to be drawing it

04:49.990 --> 04:51.558
and Cousin Larry
is going to be writing it!

04:51.592 --> 04:53.527
‐Oh!
‐Oh!

04:53.560 --> 04:55.495
Oh!

04:55.529 --> 04:57.564
‐Oh, congratulations, Balki.
‐Thank you.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.600
‐Do you want to see it?
‐Oh, yes!

04:59.633 --> 05:00.667
Whoa!

05:02.803 --> 05:04.871
It’s a, it’s a little rough

05:04.905 --> 05:07.107
because I haven’t
shaded it in yet.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.010
Cousin, I’d love to stay here
and tickle your brain

05:10.043 --> 05:11.477
for some Dimitri ideas

05:11.512 --> 05:13.814
but, but I got to go
deliver this mail.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.848
[Lydia laughs]

05:17.718 --> 05:20.353
Don’t think until I get back.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.689
I know I won’t.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.457
[indistinct shouting]

05:28.895 --> 05:30.864
I’m writing a cartoon!

05:32.498 --> 05:34.400
I can’t wait for Jennifer
to get back from her flight

05:34.434 --> 05:35.736
so, so I can tell her

05:35.769 --> 05:37.738
"Guess what your husband,
the journalist, is doing?

05:37.771 --> 05:40.006
I’m putting words
in a sheep’s mouth."

05:41.908 --> 05:43.710
You know, I‐I,
I’m not gonna stand for it.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.445
I’m just gonna tell
Mr. Wainwright I won’t do it.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.880
Wait, wait,
wait a minute, Larry.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.783
Larry! Dim‐Dimitri’s
not just a sheep.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.452
He’s a gold mine.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.089
What do you mean, "A gold mine?"

05:56.122 --> 05:58.058
Larry, this cartoon could end up

05:58.091 --> 06:00.861
running in papers
all over the country.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.697
Dimitri could be bigger
than Garfield!

06:03.730 --> 06:05.766
Just think
of the marketing possibilities

06:05.799 --> 06:09.402
of a soft, wooly, cuddly sheep.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.573
Dimitri calendars, lunch boxes

06:12.606 --> 06:14.608
coffee cups, greeting cards...

06:14.641 --> 06:17.110
Coloring books, posters

06:17.143 --> 06:18.845
breakfast cereal.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.950
Well, Dimitri,
you are going to be the sheep

06:23.984 --> 06:25.919
that lays the golden egg.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.725
[instrumental music]

06:36.129 --> 06:39.065
Now, ahem, in this first scene
you’re supposed to be sad

06:39.099 --> 06:41.935
so...let me see sad.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.173
‐Hi, Balki.
‐Oh, hi, cousin.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.975
Okay...

06:49.009 --> 06:50.811
...take five, babe.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.182
Ready to get started on Dimitri?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.851
Well, not so fast, Balki.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.120
If we are gonna work together,
first thing we gotta do is

07:00.153 --> 07:03.724
decide on a basic concept
for the cartoon.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.592
I’ve given this
a lot of thought

07:05.626 --> 07:08.194
and I think it would be good
for the first cartoon

07:08.228 --> 07:10.831
the first time we see Dimitri,
what is he doing?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.966
He is helping out with chores.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.738
I like him for that. Don’t you?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.775
Balki, that’s sweet.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.644
Oh, thank you, cousin.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.211
But sweet stinks.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.949
But, cousin, uh...

07:30.083 --> 07:32.886
Dimitri is a‐is a‐is a sweet

07:32.919 --> 07:35.889
kind, cuddly little sheep.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.058
Balki, today’s kids

07:38.091 --> 07:40.761
don’t want sweet, kind,
and cuddly.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.832
See, see,
what today’s kids want

07:45.866 --> 07:49.235
i‐is a, is a sheep
that’s gonna be doing everything

07:49.269 --> 07:52.072
they want to do...but can’t.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.709
See, they, they want
a sheep that will...

07:55.742 --> 07:57.010
...skip school!

07:59.245 --> 08:02.148
They, they want a,
a rebellious, mischievous sheep.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.620
They want a four‐legged
Bart Simpson.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.628
Then why don’t they just
put two more legs on Bart

08:14.661 --> 08:16.196
and leave Dimitri alone.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.200
Okay, Balki,
you don’t understand.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.035
‐No, no, cousin, I understand.
‐You don’t get it.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.036
‐I get it.
‐No, you don’t get it.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.838
‐No, no, no.
‐No, you’re not gettin’ it.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.773
You know what?
I get it! I get it!

08:26.807 --> 08:28.542
You’re gonna get it!

08:29.843 --> 08:32.044
Balki, we have to take Dimitri

08:32.078 --> 08:35.181
and, and mold him and shape him

08:35.215 --> 08:38.619
into something
that kids want to see.

08:38.652 --> 08:42.222
Cousin, listen to me,
Mr. Wainwright wants to see

08:42.255 --> 08:44.958
the little kind,
sweet, cuddly Dimitri

08:44.991 --> 08:47.293
that he saw
in the company newsletter.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.930
And if we are not
going to give him that

08:49.963 --> 08:52.165
then I wash my face
of the whole thing.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.738
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.905
Okay...

09:00.807 --> 09:02.042
...you’re out.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.079
I’ll have to do it myself.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.683
Oh...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.118
This is rich!

09:14.821 --> 09:17.090
[sarcastic laughter]

09:19.092 --> 09:21.094
You think
you can do it yourself?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.996
[mocking laughter]

09:23.029 --> 09:24.130
Yes.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.200
[both laughing]

09:28.669 --> 09:30.837
How hard can it be
to draw a sheep?

09:33.707 --> 09:37.711
How hard can it be
to draw a sheep?

09:39.179 --> 09:42.182
The greatest painters
who ever lived

09:42.215 --> 09:44.885
Rembrandt, Picasso

09:44.918 --> 09:46.252
Earl Scheib...

09:49.289 --> 09:52.125
...none of them ever
even attempted a sheep.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.330
Balki, I can draw a sheep
and I don’t need you.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.901
Oh, is that so,
Mr. I‐Can‐Do‐It‐Myself?

10:00.934 --> 10:03.269
Well then, I quit.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.871
Good. Who needs ya?

10:08.274 --> 10:11.845
Oh, and I already have
the first cartoon.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.880
Dimitri is gonna show
a bunch of kids

10:13.914 --> 10:16.082
how to sneak
into the movies for free!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.984
[laughing]

10:19.352 --> 10:23.256
I have to dance! I have to sing!
I have to fly!

11:00.160 --> 11:02.062
Hey, Dimitri, did you miss me?

11:11.471 --> 11:14.374
I wasn’t aware they moved
the recycling bin down here.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.347
[whistling]

11:28.354 --> 11:29.489
Cousin, you know what?

11:29.523 --> 11:30.757
That’s, that’s really

11:30.791 --> 11:33.026
quite a wonderful drawing...

11:33.059 --> 11:34.394
...of a shoe.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.365
Would, um,
would this be the cartoon

11:39.399 --> 11:42.435
where Dimitri dreams
he’s a penny loafer?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.915
Appleton, Bartokomous.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.049
How’s the Dimitri
cartoon coming?

11:56.082 --> 11:57.417
Well, Mr. Wainwright

11:57.450 --> 12:00.386
I’m gonna let Cousin Larry
field this one.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.256
Well, it’s‐it’s coming along
amazingly well, Mr. Wainwright.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.858
You know, I have to admit it.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.960
This little sheep
really makes me laugh.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.329
[sarcastic laughter]

12:09.362 --> 12:12.265
Well, if it’s coming along that
well, why wait till next week?

12:12.298 --> 12:14.134
I’ll put it in the paper
this Sunday.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.468
Have it on my desk
first thing in the morning.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.770
Y‐yes, sir.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.374
Balki, did you hear that?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.010
We, we have to have it finished
and on Mr. Wainwright’s desk

12:24.044 --> 12:25.979
first thing tomorrow morning.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.284
I’m sorry, cousin, I...

12:31.317 --> 12:33.920
I don’t quite understand.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.790
Mr. Wainwright says Dimitri has
to be done by tomorrow morning.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.459
Oh, no, no,
that part I understand.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.495
What I don’t quite
have a grasp on

12:42.529 --> 12:46.166
is why you are using
the word "We?"

12:48.468 --> 12:49.903
Okay, okay.

12:49.936 --> 12:53.039
Mmm, I admit I may have

12:53.073 --> 12:57.143
overestimated my ability
to draw Dimitri.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.995
Okay, okay, I admit it.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.330
I can’t do it.
I can’t draw Dimitri.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.299
You have to do it.
You have to draw Dimitri.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.433
Balki, help me.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.903
Help me, please. Help me.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.271
Help me, help me.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.910
[imitates Larry]
Cousin, I would love
to help you...

13:33.113 --> 13:36.550
...but as you may recall

13:36.583 --> 13:39.285
you and I just
don’t see ear to ear

13:39.319 --> 13:42.055
on how Dimitri
should be presented.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.324
Um, you see, I really see him

13:44.357 --> 13:48.261
as a sweet, kind,
cuddly little sheep.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.134
Okay, okay,
you know, you know,

13:54.167 --> 13:57.437
I, I may have taken the idea

13:57.470 --> 14:00.106
of changing Dimitri
just a little too far

14:00.140 --> 14:02.208
but I can admit when I’m wrong.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.410
Now, I’d be willing
to cut back a bit.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.446
You know, alright
tell you what, tell you what

14:06.479 --> 14:08.582
we’ll give Dimitri

14:08.615 --> 14:10.250
tough exterior

14:10.283 --> 14:12.553
but a heart o’ gold.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.954
Huh?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.989
I love it! I love it!

14:16.022 --> 14:17.591
I love it! Ooh, ooh, ooh, yes!

14:17.624 --> 14:19.325
I love the idea.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.994
Yes! Yes!

14:21.027 --> 14:22.428
[nervous chuckling]
Yeah.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.366
[mumbling]

14:32.539 --> 14:34.274
There’s his eyes!

14:40.346 --> 14:41.682
Okay, you know what?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.049
I’ll tell you something, Balki

14:43.083 --> 14:45.118
I have had it.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.953
I mean, what is it with you

14:46.987 --> 14:49.923
and, and your obsession
with this ridiculous toy?

14:49.956 --> 14:53.193
Cousin, listen. Dimitri
is not a ridiculous toy.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.962
[sighs]

14:55.996 --> 14:57.964
There was a real Dimitri.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.166
A sheep that I had on Mypos

15:00.200 --> 15:02.936
and he wasn’t just
any little sheep, you know?

15:02.969 --> 15:05.105
He was, he was

15:05.138 --> 15:07.508
the finest and the friendliest

15:07.541 --> 15:10.176
and the fluffiest sheep
in the flock.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.314
And, uh, one night
we were out, uh

15:14.347 --> 15:17.250
doing our evening jog,
and, um...

15:18.384 --> 15:19.686
...all of a sudden,
out of nowhere

15:19.720 --> 15:23.289
this ox cart comes barreling out
of some side street

15:23.323 --> 15:25.191
and is bearing down on us

15:25.225 --> 15:27.127
and Dimitri, thinking quick

15:27.160 --> 15:29.730
with his itty‐bitty
little tiny sheep legs

15:29.763 --> 15:32.432
pushes me out of the way
and saves my life.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.271
And I‐I couldn’t
do anything for him.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.209
So I took the wool

15:43.243 --> 15:44.511
from the real Dimitri

15:44.545 --> 15:46.513
and I made this
little stuffed Dimitri

15:46.547 --> 15:49.382
so that he would
always be with me.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.723
You know...

15:56.757 --> 15:58.692
I see Dimitri a‐as...

15:59.793 --> 16:02.295
...sweet, kind, and cuddly.

16:02.328 --> 16:05.431
What do you think?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.034
‐Well, we can go that way.
‐Thank you, cousin.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.737
But if we’re gonna get
everything done by morning

16:10.771 --> 16:12.038
we’re gonna have
to work very hard.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.273
‐Okay.
‐Now.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.041
We’ll stay up
all night if we have to

16:15.075 --> 16:17.711
uh, maybe you can do, uh,
some kind of, uh, rough drawing

16:17.744 --> 16:19.479
and‐and I’ll do an outline.

16:19.513 --> 16:20.547
We’ll‐we’ll get it
to Mr. Wainwright

16:20.581 --> 16:22.182
tell him it’s
just a first draft

16:22.215 --> 16:23.383
and, and ask him
if he’ll give us

16:23.416 --> 16:25.719
a few extra days
to finish it up.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.021
And I’m sure he’ll be happy
to give us the extra time.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.058
Okay, I’m finished with my part.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.627
You just got
to fill in the bubbles.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.230
[instrumental music]

16:46.573 --> 16:48.041
[sighs]
Balki.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.785
[screaming]

17:00.787 --> 17:03.456
[gasping]

17:03.489 --> 17:05.726
Balki, I have been racking
my brains trying to figure out

17:05.759 --> 17:07.627
why Wainwright
wants to meet us up here.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.762
I don’t know why he want
to meet us up here.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.231
The last time I was up here

17:11.263 --> 17:13.599
Mr. Wainwright
was firing Miss Johnson

17:13.634 --> 17:15.801
and the time before that I was
up here and I lost my mitten.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.741
Oh, my Lord. Balki, that’s it.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.175
That’s why he wants
to meet us up here.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.310
He found my mitten?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.512
No, he’s going to fire us!

17:26.547 --> 17:28.782
This is where
Wainwright fires people.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.651
He probably likes
to put on a little show

17:30.684 --> 17:32.418
in front of everybody.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.790
Appleton, Bartokomous.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.424
I suppose you know
why I called you up here?

17:38.458 --> 17:39.593
Yes, sir, we do, sir

17:39.626 --> 17:41.528
and, and may I say,
although I do agree

17:41.562 --> 17:43.630
with each and every one
of your decisions and

17:43.664 --> 17:45.431
and you are one of the great
decision makers of our time...

17:45.465 --> 17:47.300
That’s enough, Appleton.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.435
I wanted to tell you
that everyone loved

17:49.469 --> 17:51.672
the Dimitri cartoon.

17:51.705 --> 17:53.339
I especially like the

17:53.373 --> 17:55.576
the innocence
of "Dimitri’s World."

17:55.609 --> 17:57.611
A lot of people
would have tried to change him

17:57.644 --> 18:00.346
into a rebellious,
mischievous sheep

18:00.380 --> 18:01.381
but not you.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.717
Oh, no, no. Not us, sir.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.485
Not not, not us, Mr. Wainwright.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.588
I’m gonna run it every Sunday
on the children’s page.

18:07.621 --> 18:08.855
Oh, cousin!

18:08.889 --> 18:11.157
Now, we are so happy
we do the Dance of Joy.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.293
No, no, wait, Balki.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.796
Later, later... Uh, later.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.533
Do you know why I asked you
to meet me on this floor?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.903
Well, of course, we do.
Don’t be ridiculous.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.405
To see the little show
that Cousin Larry says

18:25.438 --> 18:26.873
you put on in front of everyone.

18:26.907 --> 18:28.642
I hope it’s "Oklahoma."

18:30.243 --> 18:31.678
That’s what I love about you,
Bartokomous.

18:31.712 --> 18:34.247
You’re‐you’re innocent and kind

18:34.280 --> 18:37.684
and face it, you’ve got
the a mind of a child.

18:37.718 --> 18:40.120
‐And the socks to match.
‐Huh? Oh...

18:41.622 --> 18:44.257
And that’s why I’m making you
the editor

18:44.290 --> 18:45.526
of the Sunday children’s page.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.200
Balki’s an editor?

18:54.234 --> 18:55.702
He’s perfect.

18:55.736 --> 18:58.605
‐Balki’s an editor?
‐Yes, he is.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.874
‐I’m a predator?
‐You’re an editor.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.477
And with a new job

19:04.511 --> 19:06.580
come new responsibilities

19:06.613 --> 19:07.648
and a new office.

19:07.681 --> 19:09.415
What do you think of it?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.586
Oh. oh.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.589
Mr... Mr. Wainwright, I love it.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.357
I absolutely love it.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.896
This is gonna
take some getting used to

19:22.929 --> 19:25.866
but I, I think
I can make it work.

19:38.244 --> 19:41.481
Wwowww!

19:41.515 --> 19:43.950
Balki, congratulations,
I’m very happy for you.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.691
And if anyone wants to reach me

19:50.724 --> 19:52.458
I’ll‐I’ll be
in the basement...

19:54.861 --> 19:57.230
...with all the other people
goin’ nowhere.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.402
I’ll just get in the elevator

20:02.435 --> 20:04.805
press ’B’ for
...bottom of the barrel.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.510
You know, Mr. Wainwright

20:09.543 --> 20:12.713
I‐I would’ve made
a pretty good editorial writer.

20:12.746 --> 20:13.847
But‐but you’ll never know.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.382
Because when it comes to having
an eye for a talent

20:16.416 --> 20:17.918
you are as blind as a bat.

20:19.019 --> 20:20.954
Oh, as a matter of fact,
Appleton

20:20.987 --> 20:23.557
since the cartoon
only runs one day a week

20:23.590 --> 20:26.660
I was going to offer you the job
as my new editorial writer.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.295
What vision you have, sir.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.364
And I hope you didn’t mind my,
my little joke about the...

20:31.397 --> 20:32.999
[speaking gibberish]

20:35.802 --> 20:39.606
I mean we can, we can kid
with each other, can’t we, sir?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.407
‐Of course we can.
‐Oh, yeah. Thank you.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.677
Congratulations
on your promotion

20:43.710 --> 20:45.746
and, uh, I hope
you like your new office.

20:45.779 --> 20:47.247
Oh. Ooh! Ooh!

20:49.015 --> 20:50.584
And have a nice day, shorty.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.722
[chuckles]
Good one, sir.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.858
Cousin, cousin, congratulations

20:57.891 --> 20:59.760
and welcome
to the top of the barrel.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.830
Excuse me,
Mr. Wainwright, sir.

21:03.864 --> 21:05.866
I couldn’t help overhearing.

21:05.899 --> 21:08.034
If Bartokomous
is going to be an editor

21:08.068 --> 21:09.536
then who is going to be doing

21:09.570 --> 21:12.005
the Mypiot’s work
in the mailroom?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.340
Oh, Gorpley, I’ve been aware
for quite some time

21:14.374 --> 21:16.543
that Bartokomous
has been doing his job

21:16.577 --> 21:19.312
and yours in the mailroom.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.648
And I’ve decided,
uh, it’s about time

21:21.682 --> 21:23.083
you do your job...

21:23.116 --> 21:25.786
...and his.

21:25.819 --> 21:27.287
Outgoing, I believe.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.628
Ha.

21:34.661 --> 21:38.064
Well, I suppose you think
I am, ooh, bitter...

21:39.766 --> 21:42.703
Angry? Well I am!

21:44.738 --> 21:46.339
And let me remind you

21:46.372 --> 21:48.875
poison is often
odorless and tasteless.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.816
I’m gonna miss
those helpful little tips

21:55.849 --> 21:58.384
of Mr. Gorpley’s.

21:58.418 --> 22:01.688
Well, Balki, we are on our way.

22:01.722 --> 22:03.423
People are finally
starting to look at us

22:03.456 --> 22:06.560
as mature,
responsible professionals.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.896
Cousin, is it, is it okay now?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.500
Now.

22:14.535 --> 22:17.638
Now we are so happy,
we do the Dance of Joy.
