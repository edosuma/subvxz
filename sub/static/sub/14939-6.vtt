WEBVTT

00:08.854 --> 00:10.588
Organic chemistry
is killing me.

00:10.622 --> 00:12.518
No matter how many hours
I study,

00:12.553 --> 00:13.878
I still don't feel like
I'm getting it.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.370
Your father knows how hard
you've been working.

00:16.405 --> 00:18.300
Yeah, I'm sure he talks
about me all the time.

00:18.334 --> 00:19.836
He just assigned you to me
as a bodyguard

00:19.870 --> 00:21.436
and forgot all about me.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.239
Get down.

00:24.273 --> 00:25.805
Sara, help!

00:25.839 --> 00:27.272
Lisa, I said get down!

01:28.490 --> 01:30.992
Did you not come to bed
at all last night?

01:31.026 --> 01:32.594
I-I'm sorry, babe.

01:32.628 --> 01:34.796
I was just catching up
on work

01:34.831 --> 01:36.831
and fell asleep on the couch.

01:36.866 --> 01:40.468
That Dr. Rosen's been
keeping you busy, huh?

01:40.502 --> 01:42.870
Yeah, yeah, he is.

01:42.905 --> 01:45.272
Still, never thought
I'd say this,

01:45.307 --> 01:48.108
but D.C.I.S. might not be
such a bad idea.

01:48.143 --> 01:49.877
You don't want to go back
to the FBI?

01:49.911 --> 01:50.878
Since when?

01:50.912 --> 01:52.546
Of course, I do.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.247
It's just that, you know,
working with Rosen

01:54.282 --> 01:57.051
does have its positives, right?

01:57.086 --> 01:59.788
You know, the cases are
really, really interesting,

01:59.822 --> 02:01.757
and the money is better, right?

02:01.791 --> 02:06.130
So you get to remodel
that bathroom

02:06.165 --> 02:08.466
or maybe even do the garage
for me.

02:08.501 --> 02:11.103
Honey, you got nothing
to worry about.

02:11.137 --> 02:13.139
It may be a little awkward
at first,

02:13.173 --> 02:14.640
especially with Persky, but--

02:14.675 --> 02:16.276
No, I'm not worrying
about that at all.

02:16.311 --> 02:17.912
I'm just thinking about what's,
you know,

02:17.946 --> 02:18.913
what's best for us.

02:18.947 --> 02:20.047
That's all.

02:20.082 --> 02:22.417
I know what's best for you.

02:22.451 --> 02:27.022
You belong in the FBI.

02:27.057 --> 02:28.724
I'm gonna make you some tea.

02:28.759 --> 02:31.394
Start your day off
nice and calm.

02:44.241 --> 02:45.941
Hicks, where the hell are you?

02:49.546 --> 02:51.780
We're almost there.

02:51.815 --> 02:53.248
I'm gonna lose him!

02:55.486 --> 02:56.953
Screw it.

02:56.987 --> 02:59.656
Rachel, take the wheel.

03:02.828 --> 03:05.830
I'll drive.

03:09.468 --> 03:10.768
Okay, I can see him.

03:10.802 --> 03:12.270
He's headed west on Third.

03:12.304 --> 03:14.939
What's in the package?
Need-to-know basis.

03:14.974 --> 03:16.941
D.O.D. just--
they just want the package.

03:16.976 --> 03:20.078
'Scuse me.
'Scuse me!

03:20.113 --> 03:22.681
Gary, what's his 20?

03:22.715 --> 03:24.116
Agh, come on, move it.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.684
I don't know.
I-I lost him.

03:25.718 --> 03:28.019
He went into a park,
and there's no cameras.

03:28.054 --> 03:29.521
Come on,
we gotta find this guy.

03:29.555 --> 03:31.790
Rachel, it's on you.

03:31.824 --> 03:33.091
God, I'm just pulling over.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.961
There's too much traffic.

03:35.995 --> 03:37.029
Gary, we're gonna have to run.

03:37.063 --> 03:38.264
No, we just ate.

03:38.298 --> 03:39.765
You're not supposed to run
after you eat.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.668
- Please, Gary.
- It's a medical fact.

03:41.702 --> 03:42.669
Rachel, what is your ETA?

03:42.703 --> 03:44.003
Gary won't budge.

03:44.038 --> 03:45.605
I don't care.
Get here now!

03:45.640 --> 03:46.840
Gary, you have to stay
in the car.

03:46.874 --> 03:47.841
Promise to stay in the car.

03:47.875 --> 03:48.942
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere.

03:48.977 --> 03:49.977
And do not talk
to anybody, okay?

03:50.011 --> 03:50.978
Promise?

03:51.012 --> 03:52.012
Yeah, I promise.

03:52.047 --> 03:54.548
No moving, no talking.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.216
Relax.

04:29.255 --> 04:31.089
Hey.

04:31.124 --> 04:32.724
You can't park here.

04:32.759 --> 04:35.060
I'm not supposed to talk
to you.

04:35.094 --> 04:36.394
I need you
to move this vehicle.

04:36.429 --> 04:38.296
I already said I'm not
supposed to talk to you.

04:38.331 --> 04:41.066
All right.
License, registration.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.036
D.C.I.S.
We ask the questions.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.937
Where'd you get that?

04:45.972 --> 04:48.106
I told you.
We ask the questions.

04:48.140 --> 04:49.374
Respect the badge.

04:49.408 --> 04:52.411
Step out of the van.

05:06.493 --> 05:08.661
Got it.

05:12.099 --> 05:13.733
We bumped into each other.

05:13.768 --> 05:15.635
It was an accident.

05:15.669 --> 05:17.971
We're both fine.

05:18.005 --> 05:19.105
So you can go now.

05:19.139 --> 05:21.040
I'm glad you're okay.

05:21.074 --> 05:23.843
I should go now.

05:27.447 --> 05:29.716
Sorry, I got here
as fast as I could.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.950
What happened?
It's okay.

05:30.984 --> 05:31.951
We got what Sullivan wanted.

05:31.985 --> 05:33.486
- You got it?
- Whatever it is.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.487
- Okay.
- Where's Gary?

05:34.521 --> 05:36.322
I had to leave him.

05:36.356 --> 05:37.790
- What?
- Alone?

05:37.824 --> 05:39.892
He's in the car.

05:44.798 --> 05:46.699
He promised, okay?

05:46.733 --> 05:48.167
He did.

05:48.202 --> 05:50.303
Gary--
oh, God.

05:50.337 --> 05:53.206
Shoot.

05:58.012 --> 06:00.647
I promised not to get out
of the van.

06:12.358 --> 06:15.193
She's crying.

06:15.227 --> 06:16.261
She's crying.

06:16.295 --> 06:19.097
That--that means that she's sad.

06:19.131 --> 06:24.068
She's very sad.

06:24.102 --> 06:26.670
Yes, thank you very much.

06:26.704 --> 06:28.372
So I located Gary.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.207
He's at, uh,
the 18th Precinct,

06:30.241 --> 06:33.510
and he was arrested
for illegal parking

06:33.544 --> 06:35.813
and resisting arrest

06:35.847 --> 06:38.483
and for impersonating
a federal officer.

06:38.517 --> 06:39.918
So he should be out
in, um,

06:39.952 --> 06:41.487
about 15 years.

06:41.521 --> 06:42.521
Stop it.

06:42.555 --> 06:44.523
I'm--I'm so sorry.

06:44.558 --> 06:45.858
This isn't funny.

06:45.893 --> 06:46.893
Don't--don't worry about it,

06:46.927 --> 06:47.927
because I will take care
of it.

06:47.961 --> 06:49.129
Well, you should take care
of it

06:49.163 --> 06:50.463
because you're the one who told
me to leave him.

06:50.498 --> 06:51.564
Rachel, don't go there, okay?

06:51.599 --> 06:52.899
You need to take responsibility
for that.

06:52.933 --> 06:54.234
- So do you.
- People, please.

06:54.268 --> 06:55.702
The important thing is that
Gary's safe, right?

06:55.736 --> 06:57.404
Yes, Gary is safe.

06:57.438 --> 06:58.571
Yes, Gary is safe.

06:58.606 --> 07:01.341
He'll be safer
because I will get him.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.244
Amateurs.

07:04.278 --> 07:05.578
What is wrong with him?

07:05.613 --> 07:07.414
He's in a special mood today.

07:07.448 --> 07:09.582
I don't know.

07:09.616 --> 07:11.717
Then they printed it,
and they took my picture.

07:11.752 --> 07:13.419
Gary, you need to learn
to listen to people

07:13.453 --> 07:14.754
when they ask you
to do something.

07:14.788 --> 07:16.756
I was listening, though.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.658
Good, Gary.

07:18.692 --> 07:20.660
And then I saw the sad girl
on Broadway and 4th.

07:20.694 --> 07:22.196
Thank you
for cutting him loose.

07:22.230 --> 07:24.832
Uh, you guys look
pretty busy in here.

07:24.866 --> 07:28.036
Yeah, everyone's tied up
with the Lisa Collier thing.

07:28.070 --> 07:31.540
Your FBI buddies have been
all over our asses about it.

07:31.574 --> 07:33.608
Really? What's--
what's the state of play?

07:33.643 --> 07:34.910
It looks like some
drug cartel,

07:34.944 --> 07:35.978
Los funda-something.

07:36.012 --> 07:37.880
Wait, <i>Los Fundadores?</i>

07:37.914 --> 07:40.449
Really?
I mean, what--ransom?

07:40.484 --> 07:42.318
We did get proof of life.

07:42.352 --> 07:44.353
Cell phone video.

07:44.387 --> 07:46.555
Tried tracing it.
Came up empty.

07:46.590 --> 07:49.524
Yeah, that's her.
That's the sad girl.

07:49.559 --> 07:51.093
What? Hey, Gary.

07:51.127 --> 07:52.194
Don't sit at people's desks.

07:52.228 --> 07:53.528
- What?
- Don't do that.

07:53.563 --> 07:54.763
You saw Lisa Collier?

07:54.797 --> 07:56.798
Yeah, that's what
I keep saying, Bill.

07:56.833 --> 07:57.799
You don't listen.

07:57.833 --> 07:58.800
I saw her on the video.

07:58.835 --> 07:59.835
- Shh, shh.
- And then--

07:59.869 --> 08:01.269
inside voice.

08:01.303 --> 08:03.037
And then I saw
her cell phone signal.

08:03.072 --> 08:05.206
It was very strange,
but I traced it.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.341
It was Broadway and 4th.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.009
And you know
where this phone is?

08:08.044 --> 08:09.611
Yeah, Bill,
I keep saying that.

08:09.645 --> 08:11.112
You need to work
on your listening skills.

08:11.147 --> 08:12.380
No, no, we need to get
that phone.

08:12.415 --> 08:13.382
Come on.

08:13.416 --> 08:14.783
That's not your pen, Bill.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.128
You're sure it's down here?

08:20.132 --> 08:22.365
Yeah, yeah.
It's there.

08:29.606 --> 08:31.174
Ugh.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.110
Oh.

08:33.144 --> 08:34.311
- Agh.
- Oh.

08:34.345 --> 08:36.046
Toilet.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.881
I looked up <i>Los Fundadores</i>
<i>online.</i>

08:38.916 --> 08:40.417
They cut people's heads off.

08:40.451 --> 08:41.418
- Yeah.
- There was a--

08:41.452 --> 08:42.486
there was a picture
of a guy,

08:42.520 --> 08:43.486
and he had blood pouring out.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.488
You should not be watching

08:44.522 --> 08:46.023
that kind of stuff.

08:46.057 --> 08:47.658
No, I know, but that's why
you're gonna help, right?

08:47.692 --> 08:48.892
Well--

08:48.927 --> 08:50.528
You want to help protect Lisa
from getting hurt.

08:50.562 --> 08:52.129
Yeah, there's that.
There's that.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.831
But there's also--you know how
I'm supposed to go back

08:53.866 --> 08:55.033
to the bureau, right?

08:55.067 --> 08:56.301
Yeah, you broke
an agent's clavicle.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.669
- Yeah.
- They disciplined you.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.837
It's not like
he didn't deserve it.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.640
Listen, they called me
yesterday.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.475
They reviewed my case.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.210
They're gonna kick me out.

09:04.245 --> 09:06.313
Now, Lisa Collier's father
is one of the richest men

09:06.347 --> 09:07.580
in New York.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.983
That's gonna make this
a high-profile case.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.618
Now, what I'm thinking is,
if I can crack the case,

09:12.653 --> 09:13.753
that might get me back in.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.888
I need your help.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.756
- Yeah.
- I need a partner.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.923
Can you be my partner?

09:17.958 --> 09:18.924
A partner?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.559
Bill, partners are equal.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.727
Yes, yes.

09:21.761 --> 09:22.928
So you can't tell me
what to do.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.029
I get my own say, Bill.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.030
Okay, all right.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.498
Ugh.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.166
- Ah.
- Ugh.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.501
- Ew.
- Ohhh.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.003
There it is.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.438
Agh!

09:32.472 --> 09:33.673
I told you it was there.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.541
I'm a good partner.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.042
Yes, you are a good partner.

09:36.077 --> 09:37.711
Partners get to drive, Bill.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.914
Don't even start that.

09:41.550 --> 09:44.252
Ms. Theroux.

09:44.286 --> 09:46.154
Detective Kellerman.

09:46.188 --> 09:48.823
Yeah, I remember.

09:48.857 --> 09:50.324
What are you doing here?

09:50.358 --> 09:52.693
Need to ask you a few more
questions about Timothy Darren.

09:52.727 --> 09:56.796
I want you to listen
very...carefully.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.599
Nina.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.600
Why don't you move along?

10:01.635 --> 10:02.601
I got this.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.769
You in some kinda trouble?

10:03.803 --> 10:05.304
Avoiding me
isn't a good idea.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.074
Get in the elevator,
and go home.

10:14.014 --> 10:14.981
What the hell's going on?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.082
It's nothing, Hicks, okay?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.450
Just stay out of it.

10:17.485 --> 10:18.552
It's nothing?

10:18.586 --> 10:19.954
I just watched you
push a cop.

10:19.988 --> 10:21.422
You're gonna sit there
and tell me it's nothing?

10:21.456 --> 10:22.923
You want to know
what's going on?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.526
Fine.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.497
That cop, Kellerman,
he thinks I killed someone.

10:29.532 --> 10:32.534
Is that enough information
for you?

10:40.541 --> 10:42.508
How did you find this?

10:42.543 --> 10:44.009
Agent Bell found it.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.644
He is our resident
computer genius at D.C.I.S.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.946
No, no, Bill.
That's not my cover.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.650
We have to tell people
that I'm a data analyst.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.951
- Gary--
- That's my cover.

10:51.986 --> 10:54.020
Just what's the deal here?

10:54.055 --> 10:56.123
What the hell did Collier do
to piss of <i>Los Fundadores?</i>

10:56.157 --> 10:57.558
These guys don't usually come
this far north

10:57.592 --> 10:58.693
to pull off an abduction.

10:58.727 --> 11:01.196
He has some factories
in their territory.

11:01.230 --> 11:02.430
They wanted to tax him.
He didn't want to pay.

11:02.465 --> 11:03.698
Oh, yeah.

11:03.733 --> 11:04.967
Harken,
what are you doing here?

11:05.001 --> 11:06.635
Someone found the cell phone?

11:06.670 --> 11:08.004
Actually, Agent Harken
brought it in.

11:08.038 --> 11:10.506
Bill, this is James Collier,
the father of the victim,

11:10.540 --> 11:13.308
and his chief of security,
Sara Nelson.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.377
Mr. Collier, I'm really sorry
to hear about your daughter.

11:15.411 --> 11:17.746
This is an FBI investigation.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.547
Yeah, well, D.C.I.S.
has taken interest.

11:19.582 --> 11:22.216
Yeah? Since when?
Who's this kid?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.051
I'm Bill's partner,
Gary Bell.

11:24.085 --> 11:26.053
I'm--I'm a computer genius.

11:26.087 --> 11:28.321
No!
I'm a data analyst.

11:28.356 --> 11:31.391
Agent Bell is a very gifted
member of our team.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.392
I'm a high-functioning
autistic.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.227
32 on the C.A.R.S. scale.

11:34.262 --> 11:36.863
Someone please tell me
about the cell phone.

11:36.898 --> 11:39.533
This phone is what we call
a burner, okay?

11:39.567 --> 11:40.900
They come pre-loaded
with minutes,

11:40.935 --> 11:41.968
so there's no billing
information,

11:42.003 --> 11:43.270
and they're very hard
to track.

11:43.304 --> 11:45.305
So what you're saying is,
it's no help.

11:45.339 --> 11:46.406
The kidnappers should be
contacting us

11:46.440 --> 11:47.807
with their demands very soon.

11:47.842 --> 11:49.409
Oh, that's your plan?
Wait?

11:49.444 --> 11:51.611
My daughter is out there
somewhere.

11:51.646 --> 11:52.612
Sir, you don't need
to be here.

11:52.646 --> 11:53.747
Oh, I don't.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.849
So then who's gonna handle this?
You?

11:55.883 --> 11:58.418
Mr. Collier, I can tell you
from having extensive experience

11:58.453 --> 12:00.254
with <i>Los Fundadores</i>

12:00.288 --> 12:02.022
that my partner, Agent Bell,
and I--

12:02.056 --> 12:03.156
Agent Bell.

12:03.191 --> 12:04.291
Can bring your daughter
back safely.

12:04.325 --> 12:05.392
Sir, this man was expelled
from the FBI

12:05.427 --> 12:06.527
for disciplinary reasons.

12:06.561 --> 12:07.528
I don't think it's--

12:07.562 --> 12:09.163
I don't care what you think.

12:09.197 --> 12:11.966
This man and Agent Bell
are the only ones

12:12.000 --> 12:14.436
that have made any real progress
in finding my daughter.

12:14.470 --> 12:15.937
Everyone's calling me
Agent Bell.

12:15.971 --> 12:18.006
I think what Mr. Collier
is saying

12:18.041 --> 12:20.175
is we could use all the help
we could get.

12:20.210 --> 12:23.479
I agree.
Don't you?

12:23.513 --> 12:26.082
Of course.

12:29.987 --> 12:32.488
You're in.

12:32.522 --> 12:34.590
Don't screw it up.

12:44.466 --> 12:46.434
Did you get rid of that phone
like I told you?

12:46.468 --> 12:47.568
Just a sec.

12:47.603 --> 12:48.736
I'm doing my exercises.

12:48.771 --> 12:50.605
I told you to destroy
that thing,

12:50.639 --> 12:51.740
not throw it away.

12:51.774 --> 12:52.974
You don't know the difference?

12:53.008 --> 12:53.975
It's been found.

12:54.009 --> 12:54.976
It's a burner, okay?

12:55.010 --> 12:56.844
It's not gonna lead anywhere.

12:56.879 --> 12:58.145
Just because you're
a civilian now

12:58.180 --> 12:59.413
does not mean
you can slack off.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.949
My freakin' hands are cramping
from stress.

13:01.984 --> 13:03.351
Too much sitting around waiting.

13:03.386 --> 13:06.187
The payoff is coming.

13:06.222 --> 13:07.789
Or would you rather get
sniper guard

13:07.824 --> 13:09.124
on some oil rig in the Sudan?

13:09.158 --> 13:11.327
I'm sorry about the phone.

13:11.361 --> 13:13.262
There.

13:13.296 --> 13:16.732
Was that so hard?

13:16.767 --> 13:18.001
Where you going?

13:18.035 --> 13:20.670
To get some air.
Is that okay with you?

13:20.705 --> 13:22.606
No more screw-ups.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.110
Whatever you say, sergeant.

13:31.783 --> 13:34.418
Hey, you gotta forgive Reg.

13:34.453 --> 13:36.787
He's been through a lot.

13:43.398 --> 13:44.348
Thank you Sandra.

13:44.349 --> 13:47.763
I--yeah, I'll try not to keep
Gary up too late.

13:49.275 --> 13:50.386
Yes, you're right.

13:50.387 --> 13:52.188
It has been one of those days.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.390
Uh, bye.

13:54.424 --> 13:56.125
Okay, so Bill isn't answering
his phone,

13:56.159 --> 13:57.493
and I tried the precinct,

13:57.527 --> 13:59.661
but the desk sergeant
isn't being much help, and--

13:59.696 --> 14:01.730
I hope they're okay.

14:01.765 --> 14:03.732
Well, it's no use waiting
by the phone.

14:03.766 --> 14:04.833
Let's find him.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.668
And let's start
with the precinct.

14:06.702 --> 14:08.269
Okay.

14:10.939 --> 14:12.573
I told you.

14:12.607 --> 14:13.607
I'm outta the game.

14:13.641 --> 14:14.841
I'm on probation.

14:14.876 --> 14:17.176
I don't know nothing
about any kidnapping.

14:17.211 --> 14:18.778
Why's your boy waving
his hands like that?

14:18.813 --> 14:20.681
Don't worry about him.

14:20.715 --> 14:21.715
Now, you telling me
if I go outside

14:21.749 --> 14:22.716
and check your car,

14:22.750 --> 14:23.750
I'm not gonna find anything?

14:23.785 --> 14:25.887
You can turn my ride
inside out.

14:25.921 --> 14:27.121
I'm clean.

14:27.156 --> 14:29.857
235 Burnside Avenue.

14:29.892 --> 14:31.593
11:15 p.m.

14:31.628 --> 14:32.961
Sounds familiar, huh?

14:32.996 --> 14:35.464
I see you, uh, you making a stop
on the way home.

14:35.498 --> 14:37.666
Yo, man,
how'd he do that?

14:37.701 --> 14:38.901
He can't read my texts.

14:38.935 --> 14:40.669
Not without a warrant
or something.

14:40.704 --> 14:42.004
Alonso, I'm not playing
with you.

14:42.038 --> 14:43.872
What are you gonna do?
Send me back to jail?

14:43.907 --> 14:46.175
No, we don't send people
to jail.

14:46.209 --> 14:47.276
We send them to the compound.

14:47.310 --> 14:49.178
- Gary--
- Unless they're dead.

14:49.212 --> 14:50.512
- Gary.
- Sometimes they get killed.

14:50.546 --> 14:51.980
- Gar--
- Dr. Rosen says--

14:52.014 --> 14:53.614
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Bill, Bill.

14:53.649 --> 14:55.216
Bill, don't break his clavicle.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.350
Listen to me.

14:56.384 --> 14:59.620
Okay, man, chill.

14:59.654 --> 15:01.188
Maybe I did hear something.

15:01.223 --> 15:04.225
All right.

15:08.898 --> 15:10.466
Hey, it's Hicks.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.868
Hey.

15:11.902 --> 15:14.871
So I was gonna say that I was
just in the neighborhood,

15:14.905 --> 15:16.840
but I think we both know
that's B.S.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.743
Because I don't hang out
in this neighborhood.

15:20.777 --> 15:23.813
Hell, I can barely afford
to walk down the sidewalk.

15:23.847 --> 15:26.048
So here you are.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.050
Yep.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.493
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

15:37.527 --> 15:39.561
Today was none of my business.

15:39.596 --> 15:42.064
So you came all this way
just to apologize?

15:42.099 --> 15:48.671
I find apologies work better
face to face.

15:48.705 --> 15:51.040
Okay.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.076
I'll give you a tour.

15:57.348 --> 15:59.783
Bill, I can't eat this.

15:59.817 --> 16:01.685
It's all--
it's all mashed together.

16:01.719 --> 16:04.854
There's beans,
and there's rice and meat.

16:04.889 --> 16:06.323
There's green stuff.

16:06.358 --> 16:07.625
That's good.
That's your vegetables.

16:07.659 --> 16:08.926
You gotta eat your vegetables.

16:08.961 --> 16:09.927
No, there's no division.

16:09.962 --> 16:10.962
It needs to be separate.

16:10.996 --> 16:12.164
Gary, listen to me.

16:12.198 --> 16:13.231
If you want to be
a federal agent,

16:13.266 --> 16:15.267
you gotta learn to eat
on the fly.

16:15.301 --> 16:17.069
No, we need to go and tell
the FBI that they're wrong.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.069
Oh, hell, no.

16:18.104 --> 16:19.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:19.338 --> 16:21.105
Because the cartel
didn't take Lisa.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.640
Alonso told us.

16:22.675 --> 16:25.809
No, we're not taking
anything anywhere, okay?

16:25.844 --> 16:27.210
Until we get more evidence,
okay?

16:27.245 --> 16:28.912
We have to build
a rock-solid case

16:28.946 --> 16:30.413
before we take this to Persky.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.248
So it's time
to step up our game, partner.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.083
Step up our game.
Step up our game.

16:35.118 --> 16:38.853
- Step up our game.
- Huh.

16:38.888 --> 16:41.323
Persky's on the phone
with Nelson.

16:41.357 --> 16:43.091
The kidnappers.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.426
It--$10 million.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
Okay.

16:45.494 --> 16:46.594
And the drop
is in nine hours.

16:46.629 --> 16:49.731
Okay, so, um,
they made the demand.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.967
10 million.
That's more than 1 million.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.501
That's more than 2 million,
Bill.

16:53.536 --> 16:55.103
Gary, I need you to focus.

16:55.138 --> 16:57.072
What else?

16:57.106 --> 17:01.510
Okay, Persky says that they'll
contact them again

17:01.544 --> 17:03.345
in an hour
with the location.

17:03.379 --> 17:06.415
So did they trace the phone?

17:06.449 --> 17:07.915
N-no trace.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.416
Son of a bitch.

17:09.452 --> 17:10.551
Bastards keep using--

17:10.586 --> 17:11.986
Don't take it personal.

17:12.021 --> 17:13.320
One-time burners.

17:13.355 --> 17:15.990
Bill, that wasn't me.
That was Persky said that.

17:16.025 --> 17:17.157
Okay, see,
this is where you come in.

17:17.192 --> 17:18.425
The FBI can't trace
that phone, right?

17:18.460 --> 17:19.694
But you can.

17:19.729 --> 17:21.230
Yeah, 'cause they're gonna
call back

17:21.263 --> 17:23.164
in 60 minutes.

17:23.199 --> 17:25.099
That's 11:00 p.m.,
is in 60 minutes.

17:25.134 --> 17:26.635
All right,
so we'll sit here and wait.

17:26.669 --> 17:28.236
No, Bill.

17:28.271 --> 17:29.838
We have to go back
to the precinct.

17:29.873 --> 17:31.074
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah, the cell tower.

17:31.108 --> 17:32.208
We're not going
to the precinct.

17:32.243 --> 17:34.478
We have to use the cell tower
on the roof.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.280
It's a good--
it's a good tower.

17:36.314 --> 17:38.148
That's where I get the--
the frequencies.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.383
Okay, oh, all right.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.818
Let's go.
Come on, Gary.

17:40.852 --> 17:41.952
Let's go.
Grab your stuff.

17:41.986 --> 17:43.487
- No, no, Bill.
- Come on, come on.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.988
- I'm separating it.
- We're on the fly, let's go.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.223
- I've separated these.
- Gary, let's go.

17:46.257 --> 17:47.457
Bill, you're mashing it!

17:47.492 --> 17:49.192
- Come on, Gary.
- You ruined it.

17:49.227 --> 17:50.561
- Gary, we have to go!
- Okay.

17:50.595 --> 17:53.064
Thank you, Alonso.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.167
- Gary, it's 11:14, right?
- Yeah.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.336
This call was supposed
to happen at, what, 11:00?

17:59.371 --> 18:01.372
Yeah.
No, it takes time, Bill.

18:01.406 --> 18:02.907
There are a lot of signals.

18:02.941 --> 18:04.409
- Okay, yeah.
- You have to be patient.

18:04.443 --> 18:06.177
- I know that, but--
- Patience is a virtue, Bill.

18:06.212 --> 18:07.312
- All right.
- It's a famous saying.

18:07.346 --> 18:10.382
But what do you--
what do you see?

18:10.416 --> 18:11.884
Like, millions of signals
up here?

18:11.918 --> 18:13.586
How--how do you know
you didn't lose the burn-in

18:13.620 --> 18:14.587
and all that?

18:14.621 --> 18:15.754
Bill, each signal is unique,

18:15.789 --> 18:18.457
and you have to know
where to look.

18:18.491 --> 18:19.791
I know where to look.

18:19.826 --> 18:20.926
Okay, so tell me.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.527
What do you see, exactly?

18:22.562 --> 18:25.563
Is it colors or--
or numbers?

18:25.598 --> 18:27.465
No, Bill,
I know what I do is amazing,

18:27.499 --> 18:28.966
but I need to work.

18:29.001 --> 18:30.334
All right.
My bad.

18:30.368 --> 18:32.102
Just do your thing, okay?

18:32.136 --> 18:35.038
- Yeah.
- Focus, right?

18:35.073 --> 18:39.910
If you find that phone,
I'm gonna let you drive.

18:39.945 --> 18:40.911
You just made a promise.

18:40.946 --> 18:42.279
That's right.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.948
You said I could drive.
That's a promise, Bill.

18:43.982 --> 18:45.850
I know. Now just--
Gary, focus, all right?

18:45.885 --> 18:47.819
Okay.
Okay!

18:47.853 --> 18:50.855
Thank you.

18:59.432 --> 19:01.066
Okay!
Bill, I got it.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.467
I got it.
They're calling.

19:02.501 --> 19:04.135
They're late.
They're calling.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.236
Okay, good.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.405
- I got it.
- All right, good, good.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.439
Yeah, Bill,
give me the keys.

19:08.473 --> 19:09.640
No, no, no.
Lessons.

19:09.674 --> 19:10.674
Bill, you didn't say that.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.376
- What?
- You said I could drive.

19:12.410 --> 19:13.510
- Everybody needs lessons.
- I don't.

19:13.544 --> 19:14.711
You wanna drive?
You wanna drive, right?

19:14.746 --> 19:15.812
You wanna talk
to the guys downstairs?

19:15.847 --> 19:16.813
You deceived me.

19:16.848 --> 19:17.881
I dec--

19:17.915 --> 19:19.015
Don't laugh.

19:19.050 --> 19:20.183
I'm not--
I'm not laughing at you.

19:20.218 --> 19:21.552
- It's not fair.
- I'm laughing near you.

19:21.586 --> 19:22.553
I'm not laughing at you.

19:22.587 --> 19:23.921
Are you kidding me?

19:23.955 --> 19:26.891
You gotta be yanking my chain
on this.

19:26.925 --> 19:27.892
No, just look inside.

19:27.927 --> 19:30.062
His name's on the tag.

19:30.096 --> 19:31.263
Oh, my God.

19:31.297 --> 19:32.898
I saw <i>Caddyshack,</i> like,
a hundred times.

19:32.933 --> 19:35.702
To stand here
holding Bill Murray's hat.

19:35.736 --> 19:38.505
<i>Au revoir,</i> gopher.

19:38.539 --> 19:42.509
Yeah, never seen it.

19:42.543 --> 19:43.743
You own the hat.

19:43.778 --> 19:48.048
It was a gift from Bill.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.583
You pushed Bill Murray?

19:49.617 --> 19:51.785
Before I met Rosen,
I was on a tear.

19:51.819 --> 19:54.455
I pushed a lot of people.

19:54.489 --> 19:56.924
Like that cop.

19:56.958 --> 19:59.560
I thought you were just here
for the tour.

19:59.594 --> 20:00.895
Look.

20:00.929 --> 20:02.030
If you're in some kind
of trouble,

20:02.064 --> 20:03.464
let us help you, okay?

20:03.499 --> 20:05.500
Rosen will protect you.

20:05.534 --> 20:07.902
Or I can just keep
pushing Kellerman.

20:07.936 --> 20:09.804
I mean, it's worked so far.

20:09.838 --> 20:11.405
Well, then, you're gonna have
to push me, too,

20:11.439 --> 20:12.673
because I'm not gonna drop it.

20:12.707 --> 20:15.776
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

20:19.847 --> 20:24.352
I dated this guy,
Tim Darren,

20:24.386 --> 20:27.555
before I really understood
my ability.

20:27.590 --> 20:30.559
And Tim wasn't what you'd call
a good guy.

20:30.594 --> 20:35.365
I tried to break it off
a couple of times, but...

20:35.399 --> 20:37.433
Then this one time,
we had this argument,

20:37.468 --> 20:38.768
and I yelled at him.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.303
And I said,
"Why don't you do me a favor

20:40.337 --> 20:41.735
and kill yourself?"

20:43.106 --> 20:44.306
Jeez.

20:45.792 --> 20:46.992
Look, Nina, it was an accident.

20:47.512 --> 20:49.346
I keep trying to tell myself,

20:49.381 --> 20:53.283
but it doesn't help much.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.087
Maybe you should talk
to Kellerman,

20:57.122 --> 20:58.656
tell him the truth.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.391
Look, at the very least,
he could stop hounding you.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.393
Tell him what?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.695
I mind-controlled
my ex-boyfriend?

21:03.730 --> 21:06.465
Okay, you might want to leave
that part out.

21:10.304 --> 21:12.239
Thanks for the advice, Hicks.

21:12.273 --> 21:15.276
Oh, I'm full of surprises.

21:17.613 --> 21:20.414
That I believe.

21:40.669 --> 21:43.003
Just--Gary, Gary,
follow my lead.

21:43.038 --> 21:44.237
Put your hands down.

21:44.272 --> 21:45.539
And we gotta keep
a low profile, okay?

21:45.573 --> 21:46.773
Yeah.
Bill. Bill.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.242
I'm the one
that's gonna find him.

21:49.276 --> 21:51.277
All right, go.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.317
See that? See?
I kept a low profile.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.451
- Good.
- It's that guy.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.820
No, Gary--
Gary, what are you doing?

22:00.854 --> 22:02.287
That's the guy
with the phone!

22:02.322 --> 22:03.289
He's got the phone!

22:03.323 --> 22:07.960
Bill! Bill!

22:07.994 --> 22:10.930
Gary, stay here!

22:10.964 --> 22:12.565
Agh.

22:12.599 --> 22:13.900
Gary, what the hell
are you doing?

22:13.934 --> 22:15.468
- I'm backing you up.
- No, stay. Don't move.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.003
Okay, 10-4.

22:17.037 --> 22:20.740
Agh.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.642
Hold it!

22:22.676 --> 22:25.178
Gary, get down!

22:29.183 --> 22:31.317
Ahhh!
Ahhh!

22:34.423 --> 22:35.846
It's a okay.
It's just a little bruise.

22:35.891 --> 22:36.695
It's better than a bullet.

22:36.696 --> 22:37.729
Yeah, but there wouldn't even
be a bruise

22:37.763 --> 22:39.163
if you didn't shove me.

22:39.198 --> 22:40.865
Well, if I didn't shove you,
you'd be dead right now.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.300
You wanna get shot?
No, I don't want to get shot.

22:42.334 --> 22:43.634
What were you thinking?

22:43.669 --> 22:46.036
That was amateur going
after that suspect by yourself.

22:46.071 --> 22:48.339
No, he wasn't by himself.
I got his back.

22:48.373 --> 22:49.573
- Gary.
- And then he shoved me.

22:49.607 --> 22:51.641
- Gary, shut up, okay?
- Don't say shut up.

22:51.676 --> 22:53.710
Listen, Persky,
this is not the cartel, okay?

22:53.744 --> 22:55.912
According to my source,
it's not the cartel.

22:55.946 --> 22:58.247
And that guy I just saw
definitely isn't <i>Los Fundadores.</i>

22:58.282 --> 22:59.315
I'm not interested
in your theories.

22:59.349 --> 23:00.483
If it's not the cartel,

23:00.518 --> 23:02.052
then your whole approach
to this case is wrong.

23:02.086 --> 23:03.720
- My approach?
- Yes, your approach is wrong.

23:03.755 --> 23:05.322
You just spooked a suspect.

23:05.357 --> 23:07.325
We're lucky if that girl
isn't dead right now.

23:07.359 --> 23:08.659
So, thanks
to your little stunt,

23:08.694 --> 23:10.362
the kidnappers just raised
the ransom.

23:10.396 --> 23:12.831
$15 million.
Ooh, $15 million.

23:12.866 --> 23:14.834
Why didn't you call someone
before you went after that guy?

23:14.868 --> 23:16.068
- Because I was--
- Because he wants

23:16.103 --> 23:17.437
to take credit for the arrest
for himself.

23:17.471 --> 23:18.671
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:18.706 --> 23:19.906
Trying to weasel your way
back into the bureau

23:19.940 --> 23:21.574
on my case,
that takes balls.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.442
He said balls.

23:23.477 --> 23:24.610
That's a good joke, but--

23:24.645 --> 23:26.112
Gary--Gary--

23:26.146 --> 23:27.213
- We have to be serious.
- Look, Sara.

23:27.247 --> 23:29.950
Collier cannot hand over
this money

23:29.984 --> 23:31.217
until we know exactly
who it is

23:31.252 --> 23:32.452
that has his daughter.

23:32.486 --> 23:34.454
Hey, you had your chance.
You're done.

23:34.488 --> 23:36.256
Lou, you're gonna get
this girl killed.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.559
Okay, that's it.
Arrest these two.

23:38.593 --> 23:40.761
- On what grounds?
- Obstruction of justice.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.629
Oh, what?
Get off of me.

23:42.664 --> 23:45.666
I was already arrested today.

23:51.607 --> 23:52.741
Anything happens
to my daughter,

23:52.775 --> 23:55.978
I will hold you
personally responsible.

23:56.013 --> 23:59.081
You better not have killed
my little girl!

24:14.464 --> 24:16.398
Oh, my God.

24:16.432 --> 24:19.134
Uh, oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.769
I should've listened, but--

24:20.803 --> 24:21.903
Rachel--

24:21.938 --> 24:24.006
I should've listened,
but I-I didn't.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.974
- Rachel, this--
- Rachel, it's fine.

24:26.009 --> 24:27.109
It's okay.
You know what?

24:27.143 --> 24:28.243
Actually, I'm gonna go
to a movie.

24:28.277 --> 24:30.178
Rachel, you live here.
Just stay.

24:30.213 --> 24:31.313
You know what?
I, uh,

24:31.347 --> 24:32.814
I should go anyway.

24:32.849 --> 24:36.117
Yeah.

24:36.152 --> 24:37.285
Uh--

24:37.320 --> 24:39.320
You--your shirt's
on the couch.

24:39.355 --> 24:40.321
Yeah, okay.

24:40.356 --> 24:42.656
I'm gonna go to my room.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.362
So I'll see you
at work, then.

24:53.066 --> 24:54.533
And what I said about Kellerman,
just, uh,

24:54.568 --> 24:57.569
just think about it.

25:00.474 --> 25:02.108
Could I just bend the bars?

25:02.143 --> 25:03.710
Gary, look,
I screwed up, okay?

25:03.744 --> 25:06.079
Yeah, okay, well, then--
then we get a phone call.

25:06.114 --> 25:07.280
We're off the case.

25:07.315 --> 25:08.882
That's the law.
We get a phone call.

25:08.916 --> 25:10.083
It's America.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.585
If we--if we make a phone call,

25:11.619 --> 25:14.288
then we can get out of here,
and then we're back on the case.

25:14.322 --> 25:15.556
No, Gary, we're not gonna be
back on the case.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.791
Okay?
I screwed up.

25:16.825 --> 25:17.792
No, Bill, we're partners.

25:17.826 --> 25:20.294
We both screwed up.
We ha--

25:20.329 --> 25:21.462
I have to get my shoelaces back.

25:21.496 --> 25:22.830
Yeah, well, you know what?

25:22.864 --> 25:24.198
They don't give you
your shoelaces

25:24.232 --> 25:26.000
until you get out of here.

25:26.034 --> 25:27.568
You know, I'm always calling
you guys amateurs.

25:27.602 --> 25:29.903
- Yeah, you are.
- I mean...

25:29.937 --> 25:31.771
Even Rachel would've known
not to do this.

25:31.805 --> 25:33.472
I should've just called
for backup

25:33.507 --> 25:35.541
and organized a tail,

25:35.575 --> 25:37.342
and that would've led us
right to Lisa Collier.

25:37.377 --> 25:40.946
And now I've...

25:40.980 --> 25:43.649
Put a young woman's life
at risk.

25:43.683 --> 25:47.486
Bill, the FBI,
they need us to solve the case.

25:47.521 --> 25:49.155
'Cause we're special.

25:49.189 --> 25:50.723
And we have abilities.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.592
Yeah, we do have abilities,
Gary, but you know what?

25:52.626 --> 25:53.994
My ability got me in here.

25:54.028 --> 25:57.664
I had that fight with Persky
and lost my cool,

25:57.699 --> 26:00.501
and then the FBI
kicked me out.

26:00.535 --> 26:04.104
My wife thinks
I have anger issues.

26:04.138 --> 26:06.673
You know, she has no idea
who I am.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.208
What are you gonna tell
Dr. Rosen?

26:08.242 --> 26:09.442
I'm not worrying
about Dr. Rosen.

26:09.477 --> 26:10.744
You know, my wife is
a little more important

26:10.778 --> 26:11.978
than Dr. Rosen.

26:12.013 --> 26:14.548
He's here, Bill.
Dr. Rosen's here.

26:14.582 --> 26:16.450
Bill, this is completely
irresponsible.

26:16.484 --> 26:18.886
I had to call Sullivan
to get you out of jail,

26:18.920 --> 26:20.921
and she--she's livid.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.022
I messed up, okay?

26:22.056 --> 26:23.456
I deserve it.

26:23.491 --> 26:24.658
But I need your help.

26:24.692 --> 26:27.227
I gotta get back on this case.

26:27.261 --> 26:28.729
You put Gary in harm's way.

26:28.763 --> 26:30.097
You risked exposing
the entire team

26:30.131 --> 26:31.399
to get your old job back,
and what,

26:31.433 --> 26:33.234
now you're asking
for a favor?

26:33.268 --> 26:34.969
Wait, aren't you the one
that promised me

26:35.003 --> 26:36.370
that if I joined your team
you were gonna help me

26:36.404 --> 26:37.438
get back in the bureau?

26:37.472 --> 26:38.639
Yes, I said I'd try,
and I did.

26:38.674 --> 26:40.007
But don't twist this around,
Bill,

26:40.042 --> 26:41.109
to account for what
you've done.

26:41.143 --> 26:42.110
Bill.

26:42.144 --> 26:43.578
Bill, it's 5:07.

26:43.612 --> 26:44.779
The drop's at 8:00 a.m.

26:44.814 --> 26:45.947
We have to go.

26:45.982 --> 26:47.616
Gary, Gary,
please roll up the window.

26:47.650 --> 26:49.251
This is a private conversation.

26:49.286 --> 26:50.887
Soft top.
There's no sound dampening.

26:50.921 --> 26:52.221
It's not about you.
It's not about me.

26:52.256 --> 26:54.457
Look, it is about Lisa Collier.

26:54.492 --> 26:56.026
The FBI needs us.

26:56.060 --> 26:57.627
They don't have
a snowball's chance in hell

26:57.662 --> 26:58.662
of saving this girl.

26:58.696 --> 26:59.896
And I found
the burner phone.

26:59.930 --> 27:01.964
No one else
could've done that.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.232
- Gary, please.
- No, no.

27:03.266 --> 27:04.233
You need to listen to him.

27:04.267 --> 27:06.268
We walk away from this, Doc,

27:06.302 --> 27:07.836
and the girl is gonna die.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.371
- You don't know that.
- I do know that.

27:09.405 --> 27:11.205
Every fiber in my body
is telling me

27:11.240 --> 27:12.840
these are not pros
behind this.

27:12.874 --> 27:14.141
They just want to stick it
to Collier.

27:14.175 --> 27:15.142
Why, I have no idea.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.844
It's not even about the money.

27:16.878 --> 27:18.846
They are not gonna give this man
his daughter back.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.181
Lisa Collier was scared.

27:21.216 --> 27:23.317
She's very scared.
I saw that.

27:23.352 --> 27:26.454
We can do things
that the FBI can't.

27:26.488 --> 27:27.455
You know that.

27:27.489 --> 27:30.725
It's up to us.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.098
Yeah, we're moving her now.

27:37.132 --> 27:41.135
Should be at the new place
in about an hour.

27:41.170 --> 27:43.538
Okay, but I'll agree.
It was a stupid move.

27:43.572 --> 27:46.840
Stop apologizing for me.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.875
Done.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.510
I hate to see you grovel
like that.

27:50.545 --> 27:51.645
You had to go out
drinking, huh?

27:51.679 --> 27:53.613
You couldn't wait
another 12 hours?

27:53.647 --> 27:56.282
I got parched.

27:56.316 --> 27:57.549
I'm sorry, Reg.
I really am.

27:57.584 --> 27:59.985
Wait, wait--

28:04.991 --> 28:08.194
Better place, brother.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.020
So this is all the info I have.

28:14.056 --> 28:15.976
I'm sorry,
that my partner and I have.

28:15.977 --> 28:17.544
He means me.
I'm his partner.

28:17.578 --> 28:19.947
So the important thing is
that we get to Lisa Collier

28:19.981 --> 28:21.549
before they make
the money exchange,

28:21.583 --> 28:23.017
because once the kidnappers
have the money,

28:23.051 --> 28:25.120
they are not gonna keep
this girl alive.

28:25.154 --> 28:27.589
Yeah, so you all need
to step up your game.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.424
Yeah, right.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.594
And I also just wanted
to say thank you all very much.

28:32.628 --> 28:33.929
This really means a lot
to me.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.697
I appreciate it.

28:35.731 --> 28:38.600
Bill, the exchange
instructions.

28:38.635 --> 28:39.935
They're in.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.970
Sara Nelson,
Collier's head of security,

28:42.004 --> 28:43.371
and Agent Persky.

28:43.405 --> 28:46.440
They're gonna make the drop.

28:48.176 --> 28:51.278
Sara.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.712
I know Lisa's kidnapping
wasn't your fault.

28:52.747 --> 28:53.880
- It's okay--
- When Lisa comes back,

28:53.914 --> 28:54.948
things are gonna be different.

28:54.982 --> 28:57.550
<i>I'm</i> gonna be different.

28:57.584 --> 29:01.153
You will bring her back,
won't you?

29:01.187 --> 29:04.790
You can count on it.

29:04.824 --> 29:06.392
Okay, Nelson.

29:06.426 --> 29:07.960
She's programming the route
to the drop zone

29:07.994 --> 29:09.028
into her GPS,

29:09.062 --> 29:11.497
and she--
she's using nav-guide.

29:11.531 --> 29:13.165
I hate nav-guide.
It always--

29:13.200 --> 29:14.867
it sends you the long way.

29:14.902 --> 29:16.135
It's quicker to use
the side streets.

29:16.170 --> 29:17.937
The kidnappers want to pull
an ambush.

29:17.972 --> 29:19.206
They got spots here and here.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.373
This isn't making sense.

29:20.408 --> 29:22.275
The Bronx Zoo
is the drop zone?

29:22.310 --> 29:23.443
It's a tourist trap.

29:23.478 --> 29:26.112
It's easy for the agents
to blend in.

29:26.147 --> 29:27.113
There's surveillance everywhere.

29:27.148 --> 29:28.381
I mean, there's no advantage.

29:28.415 --> 29:30.216
Except for it uses
our resources.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.953
- And keeps us distracted.
- Yeah.

29:33.987 --> 29:38.958
Lisa, you know,
we don't have a lot of time.

29:38.993 --> 29:42.762
I know you probably weren't
too enamored with Reg.

29:44.898 --> 29:47.299
He had his problems.

29:47.334 --> 29:50.903
But I feel like you and me,
we could talk.

29:50.937 --> 29:52.672
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

29:52.706 --> 29:54.874
Great, that's great.

29:54.908 --> 29:57.244
The thing is...

29:57.278 --> 30:00.147
The people that I have killed,

30:00.181 --> 30:01.849
they never saw it coming.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.752
But with you,
it's gonna be different.

30:04.786 --> 30:06.420
Help!

30:06.455 --> 30:09.023
Hey, oh, sweetie, hey.
It's nothing personal.

30:11.126 --> 30:12.660
It's just,
we can't let you go.

30:12.695 --> 30:14.429
We let you go,
we could get caught.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.165
That makes sense, right?

30:16.199 --> 30:20.970
So here's the deal.

30:21.005 --> 30:25.174
I make it easy,
like falling asleep.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.544
But there's gotta be
<i>quid pro quo.</i>

30:36.085 --> 30:40.888
I need to know what's next.

30:40.922 --> 30:44.125
So once you're, you know,
on the other side,

30:44.159 --> 30:45.626
you send me a message.

30:45.661 --> 30:48.596
You let me know that there's
something else out there,

30:48.630 --> 30:51.098
something better than this.

30:51.133 --> 30:54.369
You know, rap on something.

30:54.403 --> 30:56.437
Tickle the back of my neck.

30:56.472 --> 31:00.641
Come to me in a dream.

31:00.675 --> 31:02.776
Deal?

31:05.446 --> 31:06.780
Just nod.

31:10.851 --> 31:12.185
Yeah.

31:12.219 --> 31:15.287
You won't regret it.

31:15.322 --> 31:17.623
Say hello to Reg for me.

31:22.828 --> 31:24.930
I don't know.
Something's still not fitting.

31:24.964 --> 31:26.832
Yeah, well, staring at that
map's not gonna help.

31:26.867 --> 31:28.467
It's not the destination.
It's the journey.

31:28.502 --> 31:29.969
My mom says that.

31:30.004 --> 31:31.805
It's a nice saying, Gary.
Doesn't really work here.

31:31.839 --> 31:33.740
No, Gary's on to something.

31:33.775 --> 31:35.342
Persky and Nelson's route
has to take them

31:35.377 --> 31:37.011
north on Broadway.

31:37.045 --> 31:38.346
Yeah, Broadway and 4th.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.948
That's--
that's near the bar, Bill.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.449
The bar where we found
the phone,

31:41.484 --> 31:42.985
where you gave me
the bruises.

31:43.019 --> 31:44.853
Right, so you include
that route,

31:44.888 --> 31:49.657
and everything happens
in the West Village.

31:49.692 --> 31:52.260
Yeah, this is
Special Agent Bill Harken.

31:52.294 --> 31:56.130
I need a listing
of all recent lease agreements

31:56.164 --> 31:59.365
within a ten-block radius
of 4th and Broadway.

32:03.703 --> 32:06.272
Okay, which one this time?

32:06.306 --> 32:08.340
She said number 25.

32:08.375 --> 32:09.909
Apparently, he paid in cash.

32:09.943 --> 32:11.677
Yeah, but Bill,
this is the fourth one.

32:11.711 --> 32:13.112
Yeah, it's called
good investigative work.

32:13.146 --> 32:17.082
Just do your thing.
Check it out.

32:21.721 --> 32:24.790
No heartbeats.

32:24.825 --> 32:26.825
But something sure stinks.
Blood.

32:26.859 --> 32:28.093
Okay, back up.

32:28.127 --> 32:31.129
Back up.

32:31.164 --> 32:33.165
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:33.199 --> 32:35.033
I smell something else.

32:35.067 --> 32:37.402
An explosive compound, thermite.
It's all over the door.

32:37.436 --> 32:38.436
Hicks, you copy that?

32:38.470 --> 32:40.038
Must've rigged it to explode.

32:40.072 --> 32:41.706
Probably on a trip wire.

32:41.740 --> 32:45.110
I got this.

33:00.863 --> 33:03.565
Agh!

33:05.467 --> 33:08.470
What's taking him so long?

33:10.739 --> 33:13.274
Piece of cake.

33:20.816 --> 33:24.919
Stay back.

33:24.953 --> 33:26.487
It's the guy from the bar.

33:26.522 --> 33:28.589
They were holding Lisa here
for sure.

33:28.624 --> 33:30.124
Yeah, but they moved.

33:30.159 --> 33:32.427
All right.
They knew we were getting close.

33:32.461 --> 33:34.062
They must have somebody
on the inside.

33:34.096 --> 33:36.130
Gary, what's your 20 on Nelson?

33:36.165 --> 33:37.832
Okay, she's headed
for the drop zone.

33:37.867 --> 33:40.101
And Persky's in the car, too.

33:40.135 --> 33:42.504
This is Persky.
All units stay sharp.

33:42.538 --> 33:44.005
Yeah, that was him.

33:44.039 --> 33:45.106
Very professional.

33:45.141 --> 33:47.142
Let's go.

33:47.176 --> 33:50.812
Come on.
Come on.

34:00.488 --> 34:03.056
It's a lot of money
back there.

34:03.091 --> 34:04.458
You ever get tempted?

34:04.492 --> 34:05.692
Yeah, that's all I need.

34:05.727 --> 34:07.695
More money for my wife
to spend.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.533
Seriously.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.935
Oh, everyone has that thought.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.536
You figure,
I take a little bit,

34:16.571 --> 34:17.838
who's gonna notice, right?

34:17.871 --> 34:20.639
Yeah, with my luck,
I'd be doing 30 years

34:20.674 --> 34:22.842
before I even got a chance
to spend a dollar.

34:29.351 --> 34:30.318
How far away are we?

34:30.353 --> 34:31.820
1.6 miles.

34:31.853 --> 34:33.554
Persky can't be
the inside guy.

34:33.589 --> 34:35.324
He's too stiff.

34:41.364 --> 34:43.266
Everything okay?

34:43.300 --> 34:44.967
Speak of the devil.

34:45.002 --> 34:46.536
That was my wife.

34:50.174 --> 34:51.975
You're a bad liar.

34:52.009 --> 34:54.143
This is air 16 to--

34:54.177 --> 34:55.578
Oh, stupid nav-guide.

34:55.612 --> 34:57.013
- What's wrong?
- She's turned it off.

34:57.047 --> 34:59.882
- Who?
- Nelson.

34:59.917 --> 35:01.284
Their car just sped off.

35:01.318 --> 35:02.618
We tried to keep up
but lost them.

35:02.652 --> 35:04.219
What about you, Overwatch?

35:04.254 --> 35:06.222
Uh, negative.
I don't have a visual.

35:06.256 --> 35:09.325
What the hell just happened?
What's going on?

35:20.206 --> 35:22.140
Heh.

35:22.174 --> 35:25.577
Good news.
It's almost over.

35:34.343 --> 35:36.343
We're a mile and a half away.
We gotta find her.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.535
Yeah, I know.
I'm looking, I'm looking.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.836
There's no street cams.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.138
Okay, look.
Here's Persky's number.

35:41.172 --> 35:45.608
See if you can ping it.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.842
Okay, yeah.
Turn--

35:46.877 --> 35:48.878
turn right.

35:50.247 --> 35:53.482
Be careful!

36:00.424 --> 36:01.391
Nice moves.

36:01.425 --> 36:04.160
It's all in the reflexes.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.572
Uh, Sara?

36:14.606 --> 36:17.507
Agent Harken.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.676
My, uh,
my car broke down.

36:23.048 --> 36:26.283
Tell us where we can find
Lisa Collier.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.520
It's Sara.
Let me in.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.589
Where the hell you been?

36:31.623 --> 36:33.557
You were supposed to call.

36:33.591 --> 36:36.593
Plans have changed.
We have to move the girl.

36:36.627 --> 36:39.330
Again? Why?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.431
Plans have changed.
We have to move the girl.

36:41.465 --> 36:43.399
No, you know what?
I'm done.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.202
No one's going anywhere
'til I get my money.

36:46.236 --> 36:47.603
The money?

36:47.637 --> 36:50.739
What happened to the money?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.437
Just in case.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.672
D.C.I.S.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.941
You don't have to be scared
anymore.

37:23.975 --> 37:24.941
Don't cry.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.176
It's okay.

37:26.210 --> 37:27.811
It'll be all right.

37:27.845 --> 37:30.280
Those aren't--
we need proper handcuffs, Bill.

37:30.314 --> 37:32.115
There you go.
How 'bout that, huh?

37:32.150 --> 37:33.383
No, those are for groceries.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.486
Gary, just go.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.461
You're in good hands now.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.697
I'll be right back.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.433
Gentlemen.

37:48.468 --> 37:50.202
Gentlemen, I can't thank you two
enough.

37:50.237 --> 37:53.038
Why are we still here?

37:53.073 --> 37:55.707
What my partner means is,
uh, you're welcome.

37:55.742 --> 37:58.476
Gary, why don't you wait
for me at the van, please?

37:58.511 --> 37:59.777
No, I'm your partner.

37:59.812 --> 38:04.615
We can't...

38:04.649 --> 38:05.783
He's a very gifted
young man.

38:05.817 --> 38:09.452
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.023
Your associate Dr. Rosen
tells me you were having trouble

38:14.057 --> 38:16.426
getting back
into the FBI?

38:19.897 --> 38:21.097
Let's go.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.402
I'd be happy to make a call.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.439
Thank you.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.345
Good work, Agent Harken.

38:34.379 --> 38:35.912
Yeah, congratulations.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.714
Thanks.

38:37.748 --> 38:38.815
You okay?

38:38.850 --> 38:40.483
I'll live.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.719
No, I mean, we never had
a chance to talk

38:42.753 --> 38:45.455
about our incident.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.889
Look.

38:46.923 --> 38:48.324
I apologize.

38:48.358 --> 38:49.692
Look, you don't
have to rub it in, okay?

38:49.726 --> 38:53.996
No, I'm serious.

38:54.030 --> 38:56.565
Why don't you guys take
the collar on this?

38:56.600 --> 39:00.771
I don't get it.
I thought you wanted back in.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.607
So did I.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.878
I'll see you around.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.113
I told 'em.

39:09.148 --> 39:10.548
You told them what?

39:10.582 --> 39:12.483
Come on, you know.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.085
So why don't you just say it?

39:14.119 --> 39:15.520
Go ahead, come on.
I wanna hear you.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.954
What, Bill?

39:16.989 --> 39:18.256
Bill, uh, well, you know,

39:18.290 --> 39:20.925
given the choice, uh,
you've decided to stay,

39:20.959 --> 39:23.627
and, uh, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

39:23.661 --> 39:25.062
science and--

39:25.096 --> 39:26.330
Well, that sounds like me,

39:26.364 --> 39:27.864
minus the blah, blah, blah.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.601
But, uh, you know, Bill,

39:31.636 --> 39:33.236
I'm a professional.

39:33.271 --> 39:35.105
I can gloat in private.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.648
Oh, sorry I didn't come home
last night.

39:43.683 --> 39:48.053
I thought D.C.I.S. was
supposed to have better hours.

39:48.087 --> 39:51.022
Bad night?

39:51.057 --> 39:53.792
FBI let me go.

39:53.827 --> 39:56.796
Disciplinary committee
ruled against me, so.

39:56.830 --> 39:59.832
I thought the director said
it looked good.

39:59.867 --> 40:01.467
Guess he was wrong.

40:01.502 --> 40:03.937
Did you know?
Why didn't you tell me, Bill?

40:03.971 --> 40:05.105
I-I didn't--

40:05.139 --> 40:07.574
I didn't want you
to be disappointed, so.

40:07.609 --> 40:09.743
Yeah, that face right there.

40:09.778 --> 40:12.079
- What face?
- The disappointed face.

40:12.114 --> 40:14.148
This is not
a disappointed face, Bill.

40:14.182 --> 40:16.584
I don't--
I don't care where you work.

40:16.619 --> 40:19.754
D.C.I.S., FBI,
what difference does it make?

40:19.789 --> 40:23.091
So you just want a man
with a job?

40:23.126 --> 40:24.660
Is that right?

40:24.694 --> 40:27.329
I want a man that's happy.
Are you happy?

40:32.035 --> 40:34.737
I am now.

40:34.772 --> 40:37.706
Is there anything else
I should know?

40:37.741 --> 40:39.341
Um...

40:39.375 --> 40:43.512
No, I think that's enough
for one night.

40:43.546 --> 40:45.614
Well, I took your advice.

40:45.648 --> 40:48.250
Turns out it had nothing to do
with Tim's suicide.

40:48.284 --> 40:51.353
Kellerman was looking into some
financial scam Tim pulled,

40:51.387 --> 40:53.388
and I told him
I didn't know anything,

40:53.422 --> 40:55.389
which was true.

40:55.424 --> 40:57.058
All that worrying
over nothing.

40:57.092 --> 41:00.094
Yeah, nothing.

41:03.732 --> 41:06.667
Look, I, um,

41:06.701 --> 41:10.504
I was in a weird place
the other night, and--

41:10.538 --> 41:11.905
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.942
Um, you know, impulses.

41:19.114 --> 41:23.518
But, um...

41:23.552 --> 41:26.555
Maybe dinner sometime.

41:29.926 --> 41:32.027
Sometime.

41:34.297 --> 41:36.298
Hm.

41:42.371 --> 41:44.005
So, um, Gary--

41:44.039 --> 41:46.674
I mean, Agent Bell,

41:46.708 --> 41:49.843
that I think you--
you did an amazing job.

41:49.877 --> 41:52.245
You know, you--
you saw what mattered.

41:52.280 --> 41:54.114
And you--you kept your eye
on the ball.

41:54.148 --> 41:56.417
And, I mean,
the most important thing is--

41:56.451 --> 42:00.288
is you really did help save
a woman's life.

42:00.322 --> 42:02.023
You're stalling, Bill.

42:02.058 --> 42:03.425
You're stalling.

42:03.459 --> 42:05.928
Okay.

42:11.602 --> 42:13.403
All right.

42:13.437 --> 42:14.504
So--

42:14.538 --> 42:15.805
- Ten and two.
- Yes, ten and two.

42:15.839 --> 42:18.040
Right, now put your foot
on the brake.

42:18.075 --> 42:19.041
Yeah, brake.

42:19.075 --> 42:20.542
And--and then, uh,

42:20.577 --> 42:21.610
you're gonna turn the ignition
right there.

42:21.645 --> 42:23.411
Yeah, I know.

42:23.446 --> 42:24.779
Okay, wait, easy, okay?

42:24.814 --> 42:26.948
Now take the gear shifter and--

42:26.982 --> 42:28.716
Pull it down to "D".

42:29.818 --> 42:31.819
Here's the moment of truth.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.653
Gary--Gary, brake.

42:33.688 --> 42:34.988
Brake!
