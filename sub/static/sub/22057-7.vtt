11:41.330 --> 11:42.863
STEVE:
I'll be right back.

12:05.387 --> 12:07.688
Hey. Junior Reigns.

12:09.158 --> 12:10.691
Adam Noshimuri.

12:11.527 --> 12:13.026
Hey, you're Kono's husband.

12:13.028 --> 12:14.128
Yeah.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.997
What, you guys back
on the island?

12:16.999 --> 12:18.899
Just me.

12:35.985 --> 12:37.684
Hey, nice leis.

12:49.498 --> 12:50.831
You got a cop's gut, kid.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.065
There's at least eight
hostages in that bank.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.267
They're all tied up.

12:53.269 --> 12:54.735
Doesn't look like any of
them have been hurt.

12:54.737 --> 12:55.736
All right, I'm
gonna go in.

12:55.738 --> 12:56.804
I want you to call
Captain Grover.

12:56.806 --> 12:57.805
Tell him what's going on.

12:57.807 --> 12:58.872
Shouldn't we wait?

12:58.874 --> 13:00.340
I mean, they got
their car there.

13:00.342 --> 13:01.575
Eventually, they'll come out.

13:01.577 --> 13:02.810
Pretty sure it's safe to say

13:02.812 --> 13:04.611
that they're all armed
in there, all right?

13:04.613 --> 13:07.614
They come outside, they
see cops, what happens?

13:07.616 --> 13:10.250
Right, you got open
warfare in the street.

13:10.252 --> 13:12.486
The only advantage
that we have right now

13:12.488 --> 13:14.021
is that they don't
know we're out here.

13:14.023 --> 13:15.722
Am I the only one
who finds this strange?

13:15.724 --> 13:17.791
Wouldn't you at least
leave someone in the car,

13:17.793 --> 13:18.959
engine running?

13:18.961 --> 13:20.327
Well, maybe they're new at this.

13:20.329 --> 13:21.728
Yeah, well,
if they're new at this,

13:21.730 --> 13:23.197
means they're
even more dangerous.

13:26.502 --> 13:27.601
Junior just called me.

13:27.603 --> 13:29.002
He told me
that he, Adam

13:29.004 --> 13:30.470
and McGarrett
are at a bank robbery

13:30.472 --> 13:32.172
in progress right now.
Come on, let's go.

13:32.174 --> 13:34.708
Okay. I thought Junior was
supposed to be in class.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.677
GROVER: He's bucking for extra credit.
Let's go.

13:36.679 --> 13:38.679
Captain Grover's
on his way over with HPD.

13:38.681 --> 13:40.514
Good. They're our backup.

13:40.516 --> 13:42.049
So we wait for them?

13:42.051 --> 13:43.483
No. The longer we wait,

13:43.485 --> 13:45.786
the greater the risk of
somebody inside getting hurt.

13:45.788 --> 13:47.621
Hooyah. So, how do we breach?

13:47.623 --> 13:49.289
<i>We</i> don't do anything.

13:49.291 --> 13:52.059
I'm going in. You guys are
waiting out here for backup.

13:52.061 --> 13:53.594
Yeah, but, sir, this...
Hey, forget it, kid.

13:53.596 --> 13:54.828
You're just wasting
your breath.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.496
Hey. You just sounded
like Danny Williams then.

13:56.498 --> 13:58.031
You know that?

13:58.033 --> 13:59.266
Yeah. Sorry about that.

13:59.268 --> 14:01.201
If you walk in
through those front doors,

14:01.203 --> 14:02.636
they're gonna see you coming.

14:03.772 --> 14:06.106
Who said anything about going
in the front doors?

14:10.346 --> 14:12.012
What's the plan?

14:12.014 --> 14:13.647
Wait for backup.

14:13.649 --> 14:14.748
Wait for backup.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.383
Keep an eye on him.

14:16.385 --> 14:17.918
He's a grown adult.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.854
Yeah, he's a grown-ass
Navy SEAL.

14:36.305 --> 14:37.671
(sighs)

14:37.673 --> 14:39.406
(hushed):
Are you out of your mind?

14:39.408 --> 14:41.041
What did I say to you?

14:41.043 --> 14:44.011
I'm more helpful in here
than I am out there.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.479
I don't like to wait.

14:45.481 --> 14:47.447
You don't like to wait.

14:48.417 --> 14:49.883
Where'd you get that gun?

14:49.885 --> 14:52.452
Uh, your gun safe
under your seat.

14:52.454 --> 14:53.487
It was locked.

14:53.489 --> 14:55.055
Yeah, it was.

14:55.057 --> 14:56.990
There you are.

14:57.893 --> 14:59.092
Are you serious?

14:59.094 --> 15:00.627
I turned my back,
and he was gone.

15:00.629 --> 15:02.062
I figured he went after you.

15:02.064 --> 15:04.031
Just figured you'd, uh...
you'd follow him down here?

15:04.033 --> 15:05.499
Yeah, you told me to
keep an eye on him.

15:05.501 --> 15:06.667
That's what I'm
trying to do.

15:06.669 --> 15:08.135
I don't supposed
I could get

15:08.137 --> 15:10.570
either of you two to,
uh, wait right here,

15:10.572 --> 15:11.738
could I?

15:13.575 --> 15:15.575
You got an extra gun?

15:20.649 --> 15:22.749
That's for
protection only.

15:22.751 --> 15:24.017
You guys pull those triggers

15:24.019 --> 15:25.786
only if somebody else
is shooting at you.

15:25.788 --> 15:27.821
Otherwise, they're paperweights.
You understand me?

15:27.823 --> 15:29.056
Yes, sir.
Copy that.

15:32.161 --> 15:33.760
Move in.

15:44.306 --> 15:45.706
Shh, shh.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.208
(hushed):
I'm Steve McGarrett from Five-O.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.609
Where are they?

15:49.611 --> 15:51.278
They went down to the vault.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.046
Took the manager with them.

15:53.048 --> 15:54.614
Don't move.

15:58.354 --> 16:00.420
All right, get up.

16:00.422 --> 16:02.055
Listen to me.

16:02.057 --> 16:04.291
I want you to untie
all these people.

16:04.293 --> 16:06.927
Get them out of the building.
HPD's on the way.

16:07.563 --> 16:08.996
Let's go.

16:08.998 --> 16:10.564
Moving.

16:29.451 --> 16:30.751
He alive?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.887
Yeah, he is.

16:35.290 --> 16:36.757
They're gone, Steve.

16:38.227 --> 16:40.594
If we didn't see them leave,
then where'd they go?

16:44.266 --> 16:45.532
STEVE:
In there.

16:46.435 --> 16:48.602
(explosion)

17:01.191 --> 17:03.925
(electrical buzzing,
high-pitched ringing)

17:07.731 --> 17:09.931
(panting)

17:14.304 --> 17:16.503
Guys. Guys?

17:16.506 --> 17:18.306
Junior.

17:18.308 --> 17:19.641
- Junior.
- Yeah.

17:19.643 --> 17:21.509
You all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

17:21.511 --> 17:24.244
I think.
Come on.

17:24.247 --> 17:25.380
Adam.

17:25.382 --> 17:26.815
Adam?
Yeah.

17:26.817 --> 17:28.415
I'm good.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.286
Sir, can you hear me?
Yeah.

17:31.288 --> 17:32.520
My name's
Commander Steve McGarrett

17:32.522 --> 17:33.688
of the Five-O task force.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.890
You hear what I'm saying to you?
Yeah.

17:35.892 --> 17:37.425
I need you to get up.

17:37.427 --> 17:39.394
Can you get up?
I think so.

17:39.396 --> 17:40.462
Come on.

17:40.464 --> 17:41.796
(groaning)

17:41.798 --> 17:43.198
I need you to open that vault.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.899
Can you open that vault?
Yeah.

17:44.901 --> 17:46.634
All right, let's go.

17:46.636 --> 17:49.137
Junior. On me.

17:54.778 --> 17:56.578
Adam, once he
unlocks that door,

17:56.580 --> 17:58.279
I need you to open it.

18:00.650 --> 18:01.983
You're going upstairs.

18:01.985 --> 18:03.952
You're gonna get medical
attention right now. Go.

18:03.954 --> 18:05.286
Don't stop moving.

18:05.288 --> 18:06.721
Go. Go.

18:29.779 --> 18:32.447
Well, that explains
why they left the car empty.

18:32.449 --> 18:34.249
STEVE:
They pre-dug a tunnel.

18:34.251 --> 18:35.750
All right, you guys
get topside.

18:35.752 --> 18:38.186
Find Grover. Tell him
I'm in pursuit.

18:38.188 --> 18:40.121
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

18:40.123 --> 18:41.823
You're going with Adam.

18:41.825 --> 18:43.591
All right, you're gonna find
Jerry, you're gonna have him

18:43.593 --> 18:46.261
track my cell, and you're gonna
follow me aboveground.

18:46.263 --> 18:48.263
You understand me, Junior?
That's an order.

18:48.265 --> 18:49.964
Yes, sir.

18:49.966 --> 18:51.332
Be careful in there.

18:51.334 --> 18:52.967
Go.

19:00.143 --> 19:02.343
(water dripping)

19:20.530 --> 19:22.197
Jerry, it's Adam.
JERRY: Hey, man.

19:22.199 --> 19:23.531
Uh, not a good time. I'm...

19:23.533 --> 19:24.832
Working a robbery in progress.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.135
I know. I was with McGarrett
when he got word.

19:27.137 --> 19:28.836
Now I'm with Junior.
You guys okay?

19:28.838 --> 19:30.471
Yeah, we're both fine.

19:30.473 --> 19:31.839
But you need to let
everyone know that

19:31.841 --> 19:33.541
the four men
who were in the bank are now

19:33.543 --> 19:35.343
underground and moving on foot.
And McGarrett?

19:35.345 --> 19:37.312
He's gone after them.
Can you track his cell?

19:39.516 --> 19:40.815
Okay, got him.

19:40.817 --> 19:42.383
He's under Bethel, moving north.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.172
(tires squealing,
siren whooping)

20:04.174 --> 20:05.573
Let's go!

20:05.575 --> 20:08.076
(officers shouting indistinctly)

20:13.083 --> 20:14.882
Well, this looks like
a good sign.

20:14.884 --> 20:16.517
Yeah, that's good,
but what about our guys?

20:16.519 --> 20:17.752
Where the hell are they?

20:18.755 --> 20:19.821
GROVER:
Hey.

20:19.823 --> 20:21.522
Captain Lou Grover, Five-O.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.957
I'm looking for Commander
McGarrett. Where is he?

20:22.959 --> 20:25.026
He and the other two guys
went down to the vault.

20:25.028 --> 20:27.795
But I looked,
and they're gone.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.631
Commander McGarrett
isn't answering.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.200
All right, Tani,
I need you to call Jerry

20:32.202 --> 20:33.968
and find him.
When you're done with that,

20:33.970 --> 20:35.637
pull all the cameras
in this place.

20:35.639 --> 20:38.539
I want to know exactly what
the hell went on in this bank.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.974
EMT's gonna be here
in a couple minutes.

20:39.976 --> 20:41.643
You'll have that looked at.
Thank you, sir.

20:41.645 --> 20:43.611
(horn honking)

20:45.915 --> 20:47.181
You okay?

20:47.183 --> 20:48.750
I had a test this morning.

20:48.752 --> 20:50.485
You're in school?

20:50.487 --> 20:51.586
Police academy.

20:51.588 --> 20:53.354
I think they'll understand.

20:53.356 --> 20:55.857
I hope so.
I'm kind of skating on thin ice.

20:55.859 --> 20:57.292
(cell phone ringing)

20:57.294 --> 20:58.726
Jerry, where's Steve?

20:58.728 --> 21:00.662
JERRY: He just banked right,
and he's heading east.

21:00.664 --> 21:02.230
But that street you're on
ends at the next intersection.

21:02.232 --> 21:03.765
You're about
to run out of road.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.566
That's all right.
We'll make one.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.402
Watch out!
(horn honking)

21:13.076 --> 21:15.009
(tires squealing)

21:17.947 --> 21:19.714
McGarrett's on foot pursuit
in the sewer.

21:19.716 --> 21:21.316
I'll get men
down there now.

21:21.318 --> 21:23.851
And we'll post guys at
every access point.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.320
Hey, what about Junior and Adam?

21:25.322 --> 21:26.621
Where are they?

21:37.867 --> 21:40.068
(clattering)

21:44.674 --> 21:46.341

bullets ricocheting)

22:26.683 --> 22:28.383

22:28.385 --> 22:29.984
I got an officer down.

22:29.986 --> 22:32.520

22:39.229 --> 22:41.062
Okay, head back
the way you came.

22:41.064 --> 22:43.030
20 yards,
there's an access door.

22:43.032 --> 22:44.799
Go through that, and inside,
there's a staircase

22:44.801 --> 22:46.134
that'll lead you to the street.

Medical attention right now.

23:45.995 --> 23:48.930
Right.
He's lost a lot of blood.

23:48.932 --> 23:51.065
Watch his head.

23:53.403 --> 23:56.070
Let's go, let's go.

24:07.684 --> 24:09.884
We got a cop in back.
He's hurt pretty bad.

24:09.886 --> 24:11.752
How's he doing back there?

24:11.754 --> 24:14.188
I need something
to stop this bleeding.

24:51.427 --> 24:53.494
Two, three.

24:53.496 --> 24:55.029
MAN:
Does he have a pulse?

24:55.031 --> 24:56.597
WOMAN:
I've got a pulse.

24:56.599 --> 24:58.132
Let's move quick!

25:01.371 --> 25:02.703
(rapid beeping)

25:02.705 --> 25:04.639
Put him in Trauma 1.
Let's move!

25:04.641 --> 25:06.140
Pulse ox down to 50.
(prolonged beep)

25:06.142 --> 25:07.141
He's coding.

25:07.143 --> 25:08.676
Start compressions.

25:09.979 --> 25:11.946
Charge to 300.
(whirring)

25:11.948 --> 25:13.114
Charged.
Clear.

25:13.116 --> 25:14.515
Clear.

25:14.517 --> 25:17.018
Continue compression.

25:17.020 --> 25:18.419
What's the rhythm?

25:18.421 --> 25:20.621
Still in V-tach.
Charge.

25:20.623 --> 25:21.656
(whirring)
Come on.

25:21.658 --> 25:23.357
Charged.
Clear.

25:24.761 --> 25:26.527
What's the rhythm?
Still in V-tach.

25:26.529 --> 25:27.595
Charge.
(whirring)

25:27.597 --> 25:29.664
Charged.
Clear.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.099
What's the rhythm?

25:32.101 --> 25:34.502
Asystole.
(prolonged beep continues)

25:34.504 --> 25:36.070
Let's call it.
Coding.

25:36.072 --> 25:37.371
What?

25:37.373 --> 25:39.407
Time of death: 1337.

25:52.653 --> 25:54.453
(door opens)

25:56.724 --> 25:58.457
Hey, Adam.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.059
Hey.

26:00.061 --> 26:02.528
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

26:03.364 --> 26:05.030
How about the cop?

26:07.535 --> 26:09.234
What happened?

26:09.236 --> 26:11.370
JUNIOR: It's friendly fire.
He was down in the sewer,

26:11.372 --> 26:13.572
and McGarrett thought it
was a hostile.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.207
TANI: Oh, my God.
Yeah.

26:15.209 --> 26:17.109
Body's in there.

26:38.933 --> 26:40.933
(sighs)

26:45.206 --> 26:47.873
Hey, you mind if I
sit down with you, man?

26:59.186 --> 27:01.754
It was dark down there, man.

27:01.756 --> 27:03.822
There's no way
you could've known.

27:03.824 --> 27:04.957
No, man.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.959
I messed up.

27:06.961 --> 27:08.093
Don't do that.

27:08.095 --> 27:10.462
Didn't have a visual.

27:11.365 --> 27:13.132
Steve, listen to me.

27:13.134 --> 27:15.134
It was an accident.

27:15.136 --> 27:16.635
The guy was trained.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.303
He should have
identified himself as a cop.

27:18.305 --> 27:19.338
Lou...

27:19.340 --> 27:21.273
I didn't have a visual.

27:37.725 --> 27:39.992
♪ ♪

27:44.565 --> 27:46.732
How's McGarrett?

27:49.103 --> 27:50.502
All right, Jerry,
what do we know?

27:50.504 --> 27:52.704
Well, HPD's sending over
footage from the bank,

27:52.706 --> 27:54.740
but I just got the
update from Duke.

27:54.742 --> 27:56.975
Looks like these
guys did some

27:56.977 --> 27:58.610
hard-core advance planning.

27:58.612 --> 28:00.045
They disabled
the alarm

28:00.047 --> 28:01.647
before they even set foot
in the building.

28:01.649 --> 28:03.649
Eric thinks they killed it
sometime late last night.

28:03.651 --> 28:05.083
That's impressive.

28:05.085 --> 28:06.819
Yeah, but not as impressive
as their haul.

28:06.821 --> 28:08.987
Initial report is they made off
with ten million in cash.

28:08.989 --> 28:10.556
Ten million in cash?

28:10.558 --> 28:13.025
That's a hell of a big reserve
for one branch.

28:13.027 --> 28:14.526
Yeah, and the weird thing is

28:14.528 --> 28:16.595
that it was all deposited
yesterday.

28:16.597 --> 28:19.498
So the robbers knew about it,

28:19.500 --> 28:21.433
meaning that it
was an inside job.

28:21.435 --> 28:22.901
Someone from the bank
tipped them off.

28:22.903 --> 28:24.703
Yeah.
JUNIOR: Wait, hang on. I'm still stuck

28:24.705 --> 28:26.305
on ten million.
I mean, I mean...

28:26.307 --> 28:27.973
who deposits that
kind of paper?

28:27.975 --> 28:29.708
ADAM:
Organized crime.

28:30.311 --> 28:31.743
You talking from experience?

28:31.745 --> 28:33.011
Yeah.

28:33.013 --> 28:34.112
JERRY:
His dad was, like,

28:34.114 --> 28:35.547
the OG of OGs.

28:35.549 --> 28:36.481
Yakuza?

28:36.483 --> 28:39.117
Yeah.
That's badass, man.

28:39.119 --> 28:40.619
GROVER: You can start a
fan club later.

28:40.621 --> 28:42.554
For right now,
can we focus?

28:42.556 --> 28:45.224
Because, if Adam is right,
we need to start

28:45.226 --> 28:47.292
looking into everybody
inside that bank.

28:47.294 --> 28:48.594
This thing has ties

28:48.596 --> 28:49.928
to organized crime,

28:49.930 --> 28:52.531
then this is way bigger
than a bank robbery.

28:52.533 --> 28:54.233
You're talking money laundering?
Absolutely.

28:54.235 --> 28:55.267
JERRY:
I'll get into that,

28:55.269 --> 28:56.902
but as far as who
tipped off the thieves,

28:56.904 --> 28:58.837
I would start with this guy.

28:58.839 --> 29:00.205
His name is Bobby Akamu.

29:00.207 --> 29:03.175
He's been a bank teller at
this branch for four years.

29:03.177 --> 29:04.910
Why do you like him
for the inside man?

29:04.912 --> 29:06.845
Because, when CSU
processed the crime scene,

29:06.847 --> 29:08.347
they found his prints
inside the vault.

29:08.349 --> 29:10.682
But he works there.
Why is that unusual?

29:11.919 --> 29:15.120
GROVER: Now, according
to the bank manager,

29:15.122 --> 29:18.323
nobody in the entire bank
went in that vault yesterday.

29:18.325 --> 29:20.659
And you being
a bank teller,

29:20.661 --> 29:23.462
that means you're hardly ever
in the vault to begin with.

29:23.464 --> 29:27.266
So we're curious to know how
your prints ended up in there.

29:27.268 --> 29:28.500
I don't know. I mean...

29:28.502 --> 29:30.903
maybe I left them
the last time I was in there.

29:30.905 --> 29:32.771
(imitates buzzer)
Try again.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.273
Who do you think
you're talking to?

29:34.275 --> 29:35.941
Security at the mall?

29:35.943 --> 29:38.443
We got people working in labs,
and our labs tell us

29:38.445 --> 29:40.445
that those prints are fresh.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.614
They're less
than 24 hours old.

29:42.616 --> 29:44.016
We know you were in the vault,
all right?

29:44.018 --> 29:45.550
We know you were in there
this morning.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.486
What were you doing in there?
That's what we want to know.

29:47.488 --> 29:48.453
What, were you planting

29:48.455 --> 29:49.688
bomb materials
for your friends? What?

29:49.690 --> 29:50.789
GROVER:
Hey, look at me.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.357
Listen to me.

29:52.359 --> 29:54.293
A cop is dead.

29:54.295 --> 29:55.827
What, do you think
this is going away?

29:55.829 --> 29:57.863
That it's like a traffic stop,
a busted taillight?

29:57.865 --> 29:59.765
Everybody on the force
and their mama

29:59.767 --> 30:01.266
wants a piece of you.

30:01.268 --> 30:02.935
So, even if you walk
out of here,

30:02.937 --> 30:06.104
I guaran-damn-tee you somebody's
gonna walk right up to you

30:06.106 --> 30:08.340
and Jack Ruby that ass,
and I can't imagine

30:08.342 --> 30:10.709
there's a judge on this rock
that'll do anything

30:10.711 --> 30:12.878
to the shooter
except pat him on the back.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.814
- I didn't kill him.
- You didn't have to, you knothead.

30:15.816 --> 30:20.552
You created the circumstances
for which now a man is dead.

30:20.554 --> 30:22.688
That means...

30:22.690 --> 30:25.590
this is on you,

30:25.592 --> 30:28.694
whether you pulled
the trigger or not.

30:49.316 --> 30:51.016
JUNIOR:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a sec.

30:51.018 --> 30:52.551
What's up?

30:54.388 --> 30:56.154
Is that, uh...

30:56.156 --> 30:58.123
Oh, my God.
Hang on.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.794
TANI:
You're kidding.

31:02.796 --> 31:04.129
JERRY:
What, you recognize that guy?

31:04.131 --> 31:05.430
Yeah.

31:08.235 --> 31:09.267
(lock buzzes, door opens)

31:09.269 --> 31:10.435
Hey.

31:10.437 --> 31:12.337
Something you need to see.

31:13.574 --> 31:15.741
What do you got?
Look at this.

31:19.613 --> 31:21.179
TANI:
It's the cop from the sewer.

31:21.181 --> 31:22.748
Except he's obviously not a cop.

31:23.617 --> 31:24.950
GROVER:
Well, I'll be damned.

31:24.952 --> 31:26.151
JUNIOR:
They must have changed

31:26.153 --> 31:27.819
into HPD uniforms
inside the vault.

31:27.821 --> 31:29.588
ADAM: After that,
all they had to do

31:29.590 --> 31:30.856
was get up to the street

31:30.858 --> 31:34.059
and blend in with all the
other cops in the area.

31:46.607 --> 31:48.306
(bell dings)

31:54.281 --> 31:56.615
Tani, go talk to Noelani.

31:56.617 --> 31:58.650
Have her run prints
on that body, okay?

31:58.652 --> 32:00.052
What about the bank teller,
Akamu?

32:00.054 --> 32:01.186
He give us anything?

32:01.188 --> 32:02.354
No, he ain't talking.

32:02.356 --> 32:04.523
If Akamu really
is the inside man,

32:04.525 --> 32:06.958
he's probably more afraid
of his crew than you guys.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.293
Yeah, he probably is.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.328
Why don't we use that?

32:10.330 --> 32:11.530
How do you mean?

32:11.532 --> 32:12.597
We go talk to Akamu

32:12.599 --> 32:14.833
and tell him we got
this guy in custody.

32:14.835 --> 32:17.002
And we'll tell him
we're about to put

32:17.004 --> 32:18.270
the word on the street

32:18.272 --> 32:20.205
that Akamu's the one
that gave this guy up.

32:20.207 --> 32:21.339
Oh, that sound like fun.

32:21.341 --> 32:22.574
Yeah, you like that?

32:45.370 --> 32:47.237
Heading up a floor.

32:51.042 --> 32:52.909
(bell dings)

32:56.882 --> 32:58.848
This is Commander McGarrett.

32:58.850 --> 33:01.251
I want the Palace sealed
right now.

33:02.387 --> 33:04.554
(alarm blaring)

33:07.159 --> 33:09.159
STEVE: Knees, knees!
Get on your knees!

33:09.161 --> 33:11.461
Everybody on your knees.
Show me your hands.

33:11.463 --> 33:13.463
Keep your hands where
I can see them.

33:13.465 --> 33:15.031
Nobody move.

33:18.937 --> 33:20.470
We must have just missed them.

33:21.006 --> 33:22.205
Doors.

33:28.413 --> 33:30.213
Lou.

33:37.322 --> 33:39.389
(heavy gunfire continues)

33:42.093 --> 33:43.293
Let's get down there.

34:11.656 --> 34:13.556
Lou.

34:13.558 --> 34:14.524
Hey!

34:14.525 --> 34:15.625
Let me see them hands.

34:15.627 --> 34:17.560
Let me see 'em.

34:18.563 --> 34:20.597
Get your ass out here.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.266
Hands. Hands where I
can see 'em right now.

34:24.268 --> 34:26.503
Behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.071
Don't move.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.545
Oh.

34:36.547 --> 34:37.981
That was easy.

34:37.983 --> 34:39.815
GROVER: Yeah, well,
don't get used to it, kid.

34:39.818 --> 34:41.284
The bad guys don't
usually come to us.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.219
Copy that.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.101
♪ ♪

35:17.923 --> 35:19.455
What's up, kid?
Are you all right?

35:19.457 --> 35:21.591
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
No, I was just thinking--

35:21.593 --> 35:22.892
you know, we never found out

35:22.894 --> 35:24.627
who deposited
that money into the bank.

35:24.629 --> 35:25.828
Oh, yeah.

35:25.830 --> 35:27.797
Well, you can solve that
on a little something

35:27.799 --> 35:29.832
we like to call “tomorrow.”

35:29.834 --> 35:32.168
(chuckles) Yeah, I guess.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.337
But wait, um, so I did a...

35:34.339 --> 35:38.508
a deep dive on the bank robber,
and it turns out

35:38.510 --> 35:40.076
that Five-O's crossed paths

35:40.078 --> 35:42.946
with the guy who executed
the bank teller.

35:43.915 --> 35:46.583
Dave Lockhart.

35:46.585 --> 35:47.884
Okay. Doesn't ring a bell.

35:47.886 --> 35:50.720
Yeah, well, he was before
both of our times.

35:50.722 --> 35:52.755
The guys questioned him

35:52.757 --> 35:55.992
in connection to a
murder back in 2011.

35:55.994 --> 35:57.961
He alibied out,
but then was convicted

35:57.963 --> 35:59.862
for some other stuff,

35:59.864 --> 36:02.465
and then made parole
about a year ago.

36:02.467 --> 36:04.367
So he's a repeat
guest in rendition.

36:04.369 --> 36:06.803
Well, I guess that explains
why he, uh...

36:06.805 --> 36:09.305
knew where the bank teller was.
Mm-hmm.

36:13.178 --> 36:16.312
You do realize
that cops sleep, too, right?

36:17.349 --> 36:19.115
Let me give you some advice,
kiddo.

36:19.117 --> 36:20.617
Get it while you can.

36:20.619 --> 36:22.118
I will. I will.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.853
Me... (sighs)

36:23.855 --> 36:27.557
I'm gonna go home, hug my wife
and soak my feet.

36:29.127 --> 36:31.561
Warm me some milk
and fall asleep

36:31.563 --> 36:36.499
watching some old...
(yawns) reruns.

36:36.501 --> 36:37.800
Damn.

36:37.802 --> 36:39.435
(chuckling): Sound like
an old man, don't I?

36:39.437 --> 36:40.870
No.

36:40.872 --> 36:42.338
Yes. (chuckles)

36:42.340 --> 36:44.540
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
I am an old man.

36:44.542 --> 36:46.509
And that'll be
our little secret.

36:49.047 --> 36:50.480
Thank you again

36:50.482 --> 36:52.749
for... this morning.

36:52.751 --> 36:54.317
The-the video.

36:54.319 --> 36:56.185
What video?

36:57.022 --> 36:58.254
Right.

36:58.256 --> 37:00.189
I know that I've...

37:00.191 --> 37:02.392
I've had a couple missteps.

37:02.394 --> 37:06.229
You know, the-the...
the Aaron Wright thing,

37:06.231 --> 37:09.265
and then now this with Koa.

37:09.267 --> 37:12.535
Um, and I just...
I want you to know

37:12.537 --> 37:14.370
it's not gonna happen again.

37:14.372 --> 37:15.872
Child, please.

37:15.874 --> 37:17.440
Of course it's gonna
happen again.

37:17.442 --> 37:19.942
Probably happen
before I leave here tonight.

37:19.944 --> 37:21.277
You're new.

37:21.279 --> 37:23.546
Listen.

37:23.548 --> 37:25.815
(sighs)

37:27.585 --> 37:31.387
This may come as a shock to you,
but, uh...

37:31.389 --> 37:33.222
I was young once.

37:33.224 --> 37:34.557
(laughs)

37:34.559 --> 37:36.559
New on the job.

37:36.561 --> 37:38.594
Made my share of mistakes.

37:38.596 --> 37:41.831
I just don't want
to let you guys down.

37:41.833 --> 37:44.667
Well, I don't see that
happening.

37:44.669 --> 37:47.036
I mean, Commander McGarrett,
he-he trusts you.

37:47.038 --> 37:48.938
He has a lot
of faith in you.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.707
We all do. Cheer up.

37:51.743 --> 37:53.876
Come on, let's go.
I'll walk you out.

37:53.878 --> 37:55.678
Okay. Thank you. I just, um...

37:55.680 --> 37:59.282
There's... I just have to do
one thing, so I'm gonna stay.

37:59.284 --> 38:03.352
Well, as my grandfather
used to say... “Bye.”

38:03.354 --> 38:05.121
(chuckles)

38:05.123 --> 38:06.122
See you tomorrow.

38:06.124 --> 38:08.725
Bye.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.602
STEVE:
All right, buddy.

38:20.438 --> 38:22.138
Here we are, man.

38:27.212 --> 38:28.578
We made it.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.947
Finally,
home sweet home.

38:30.949 --> 38:32.515
Sorry about your luggage.

38:32.517 --> 38:36.219
I guess I officially boned
that airport pickup, didn't I?

38:36.221 --> 38:38.788
(chuckles) Next time,
I think I'll take a cab.

38:38.790 --> 38:39.922
Yeah.

38:39.924 --> 38:41.858
I don't blame you.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.426
Hey, listen, um...

38:43.428 --> 38:45.461
I know it's not the first time,
but I really

38:45.463 --> 38:47.196
appreciated you having
my back today. Thank you.

38:47.198 --> 38:49.932
That's what <i>ohana</i> is for, right?

38:49.934 --> 38:51.267
Right.

38:51.269 --> 38:53.269
And, uh...

38:53.271 --> 38:54.570
I'm sorry about this.

38:54.572 --> 38:56.706
(sighs)
Triage. I get it.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.474
STEVE:
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:58.476 --> 39:00.710
Well, you're just...
you're not taking these?

39:00.712 --> 39:03.045
They're all yours.
Don't think I won't

39:03.047 --> 39:06.048
wash the blood out and wear them
out to a nice dinner.

39:06.050 --> 39:07.517
(chuckling):
Knock yourself out, man.

39:07.519 --> 39:08.985
All right.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.424
You all right?

39:15.426 --> 39:16.826
(sighs)

39:16.828 --> 39:18.261
Yeah.

39:19.430 --> 39:20.663
Look, man, you got my number.

39:20.665 --> 39:22.765
You want to get a drink,
hang out, whatever,

39:22.767 --> 39:24.300
just give me a call, yeah?

39:25.136 --> 39:26.602
Thanks, man.

39:47.091 --> 39:49.592
(cell phone ringing)

39:53.698 --> 39:55.364
Hey, Tani, what's up?

39:55.366 --> 39:58.034
Hi. Um, sorry to bother you.

39:58.036 --> 40:00.036
I just, um...

40:00.038 --> 40:01.404
Can we meet up somewhere?

40:01.406 --> 40:02.638
Yeah. You okay?

40:02.640 --> 40:04.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm good.

40:04.509 --> 40:06.008
I just, uh...

40:06.010 --> 40:08.010
Something happened this morning,

40:08.012 --> 40:12.215
and I think... I think
you should know about it.

40:12.217 --> 40:14.450
All right. I'll be right there.

40:35.874 --> 40:37.340
Hey, baby. Here you go.

40:37.342 --> 40:39.408
Oh, look at you.

40:39.410 --> 40:40.843
MAN:
All right, turn this way.

40:40.845 --> 40:42.645
Say something
to the folks at home.

40:42.647 --> 40:44.380
Like what? (laughs)

40:44.382 --> 40:46.549
MAN: I don't know, say something
nice about each other.

40:46.551 --> 40:47.683
Um...

40:47.685 --> 40:49.619
L-Layla, I, uh...

40:49.621 --> 40:52.421
think you're smart
and beautiful.

40:52.423 --> 40:54.056
And I'm going to miss you
like crazy.

40:54.058 --> 40:55.725
I-I don't know
how I'm going to get

40:55.727 --> 40:57.660
through boot camp
without you, but...

40:57.662 --> 40:59.061
I am not wearing
waterproof eyeliner.

40:59.063 --> 41:00.296
Do not make me cry.

41:00.298 --> 41:02.698
Um... I-I just want
to say thank you.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.534
I want to say thank you
for being you.

41:05.536 --> 41:07.837
Thank you for being
my best friend.

41:07.839 --> 41:10.940
And, uh, thank you
for helping me through calculus

41:10.942 --> 41:12.775
and letting me cheat
off you during the final.

41:12.777 --> 41:14.076
MAN:
Hey, what was that?

41:14.078 --> 41:15.945
(Junior and Layla laughing)

41:15.947 --> 41:18.014
Uh, my boo's going
into the Navy.

41:18.016 --> 41:19.849
I'm so proud of him.
He's gonna...

41:19.851 --> 41:22.218
He's gonna look so handsome
in his white uniform.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.053
Uh, how long is
training again?

41:24.055 --> 41:25.187
Eight weeks?
Yeah.

41:25.189 --> 41:26.589
If we can get you
through calculus,

41:26.591 --> 41:27.823
we can get you
through that.

41:27.825 --> 41:29.258
Semper Fi.

41:29.260 --> 41:31.928
Baby, that's the Marines.

41:31.930 --> 41:33.496
Really? Oh.
Yeah.

41:33.498 --> 41:34.864
What do you guys say?
Hooyah.

41:34.866 --> 41:37.333
Hooyah. Like... like:
“Who ya gonna marry one day”.

41:37.335 --> 41:38.634
(laughs)

41:38.636 --> 41:40.670
MAN: All right, on the count
of three, say “hooyah!”

41:40.672 --> 41:42.605
JUNIOR and LAYLA:
Okay. One, two, three.

41:42.607 --> 41:45.207
BOTH:
Hooyah!
