<i>- Ready?
Let's do this!</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:08.267
- Come on,
you fuckin' zombies!

01:12.572 --> 01:13.572
- Yep!

01:33.359 --> 01:34.460
- I'm out!

01:34.462 --> 01:35.462
- Same!

01:38.465 --> 01:39.932
- Come on!

01:47.540 --> 01:49.808
Come on!

02:11.064 --> 02:13.398
-<i> I've got a story to tell.</i>

02:15.502 --> 02:19.204
<i>Yesterday I went pig huntin'
with my brothers</i>

02:19.206 --> 02:21.573
<i>Mulla and Tony.</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:23.575
<i>I drove the car.</i>

02:26.779 --> 02:29.615
<i>Tony brought his blues guitar.</i>

02:29.617 --> 02:31.750
<i>Mulla brought
his favorite rifle.</i>

02:31.752 --> 02:34.253
And I brought
my mean little sawed off

02:34.255 --> 02:36.121
pistol grip 12 gauge.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.059
We went bush.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.498
<i>There was a strange feelin'
in the air.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.634
<i>Dead silent.</i>

02:48.636 --> 02:51.937
<i>That night I... I...
we made a fire.</i>

02:51.939 --> 02:54.806
<i>Like I usually do.</i>

02:54.808 --> 02:56.808
<i>We just sat there
barely talkin'.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:02.314
Then Mulla sees it.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.217
<i>Shooting stars.</i>

03:05.885 --> 03:07.486
<i>Everywhere.</i>

03:09.422 --> 03:12.424
I look up and I see them
lightin' up the sky.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.028
And I'm scared.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.731
I get a feelin'.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.168
I get a feelin' right..

03:24.370 --> 03:25.370
<i>...here.</i>

03:27.974 --> 03:29.641
That night..

03:29.643 --> 03:32.244
...it took me ages
to go to sleep.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.146
And when I did..

03:34.148 --> 03:36.148
...I dreamed bad things.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.419
<i>I woke up in the morning..</i>

03:40.421 --> 03:43.388
<i>...Mulla and Tony were gone.</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:45.557
<i>Then, I saw blood trails.</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:46.892
<i>I followed them.</i>

03:46.894 --> 03:49.161
<i>I saw Mulla.</i>

03:49.163 --> 03:51.063
He was dead.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.665
<i>I look out into the bush
and I see Tony.</i>

03:53.667 --> 03:55.767
<i>I called out to him.</i>

03:55.769 --> 03:57.703
Tony!

03:57.705 --> 03:59.404
Then he turns.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.111
That's not me brother.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.547
<i>Then he came at me.</i>

04:08.549 --> 04:10.148
<i>And I just run.</i>

04:10.150 --> 04:11.650
<i>Yellin' at him to stop.</i>

04:11.652 --> 04:13.652
But he just keeps comin'.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.555
After a while I get tired

04:17.558 --> 04:20.858
and I just start walkin'.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.428
<i>I must have went like that
for hours.</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:26.732
<i>Me walkin' and him chasin'.</i>

04:30.136 --> 04:32.738
Then I turn, aim the gun.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.808
I took out his legs.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.810
I blew his kneecap off.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.381
<i>Then he starts crawlin' at me.</i>

04:42.383 --> 04:44.616
<i>I aim for his head.</i>

04:46.185 --> 04:48.186
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

04:50.556 --> 04:52.691
I should have shot him.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.399
Barry.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.401
<i>You got any stories?</i>

05:05.772 --> 05:09.608
- This morning I shot my wife
and child with a nail gun.

05:11.377 --> 05:14.046
I don't know how to make that
into a story.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.324
- Uh-uh.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.326
Get rid of it.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.697
Wash your hands.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.911
- So I told Kaytlin that Tea
kissed Jason

05:45.913 --> 05:48.413
but Jason's not officially
going out with Kaytlin.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.049
Like they're just friends,
but he also told Angie that

05:51.051 --> 05:52.818
<i>they were friends
with benefits type deal.</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:55.287
<i>So I don't know
what to believe.</i>

05:55.289 --> 05:58.190
<i>Jason told Max that
they were like going steady.</i>

05:58.192 --> 05:59.358
- Come on, Meganne.
Hang up the phone.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.759
- One second.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.762
So like Tea's like, "Oh, my God,
everyone thinks I'm a slut."

06:03.764 --> 06:04.763
- Meganne!
- <i> And I was like..</i>

06:04.765 --> 06:06.164
- <i> Oi!</i>
- ...no, they don't.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.033
But they so do.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.301
- Watch your language, please.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.403
- Put your phone away.
- I'm talking to Lisa.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.904
- I don't care
if you're talking to Jesus.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.606
Off your phone
or you'll lose it.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.942
- Do as you're told.
- I gotta go, Lisa.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.946
Mum's having a hissy fit.
Okay. Laters.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.182
<i>- Oh, Barry.</i>
- You're a full grub, dad.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.952
- Can you not be a barbarian
just for 3 minutes?

06:26.954 --> 06:28.720
-<i> I'm sorry, babe.</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:31.223
- Meganne, come on.
Eat properly.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.653
-<i> Night, hon.</i>

07:34.855 --> 07:37.122
<i>- Stop it.
You're crazy.</i>

07:40.526 --> 07:41.526
- Yes.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.634
<i>Yep. Nice, Charlie.</i>

07:49.636 --> 07:51.303
<i>Yes, nice.</i>

07:51.305 --> 07:54.906
Do that one more time
for me, babe?

07:56.143 --> 07:58.143
- Charlie! Shh!
- Oh, God.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.145
- Hon, what's the matter?

08:01.548 --> 08:04.149
- What... the fuck is that?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.553
- Charlie! Charlie!

08:16.597 --> 08:17.597
- Fuck!

08:51.497 --> 08:52.831
- Charlie, don't..

09:52.658 --> 09:53.658
- Aah!

10:34.567 --> 10:35.800
- Yeah.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.969
- Oh, Barry! Thank fuck!
Fuck! Are you okay?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.505
Is Annie and Meganne safe?
- Brooke?

10:40.507 --> 10:42.440
- Listen, I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.343
Everyone is turning crazy.
Sherri and Charlie just turned.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.013
<i>Their eyes..
Their eyes went fucking white.</i>

10:48.015 --> 10:49.514
- Just slow down.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.384
- I had to chop off Sherri's
head with a God damn shovel.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.252
<i>- Whoa whoa whoa!
Calm down. Where are you?</i>

10:54.254 --> 10:56.788
- I'm in the studio
in Bulla Bulla.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.423
Barry, listen to me, you gotta
get somewhere safe, man.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.458
You gotta get
out of the city... like fuck!

11:00.460 --> 11:03.161
F..

11:03.163 --> 11:04.163
- Chook?

11:06.298 --> 11:07.298
-<i> Daddy.</i>

11:10.536 --> 11:12.470
There's someone in the kitchen.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.808
- Barry.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.945
No, just... Barry, just stay
here. Just call the police.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.947
- Call the cops.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.657
A little help!

12:12.732 --> 12:14.799
<i>Get this thing off me.</i>

12:21.440 --> 12:23.074
Get the axe!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.076
Get the fucking axe!

12:29.348 --> 12:31.348
<i>Hurry up.
What are you waiting for?</i>

12:35.322 --> 12:37.655
- Meganne! Get back
in the bedroom! Go! Go!

13:20.132 --> 13:22.534
- Straight to the car.
- Uh-huh.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.532

14:03.209 --> 14:05.710
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.528

14:23.530 --> 14:25.196
Keep your seatbelt on.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.198
- Come on, Meganne.
Hold on.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.910
- Shit.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.346
- <i> Daddy!</i>
- Close your eyes, honey.

15:49.982 --> 15:50.982
- Clear.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.135
- What the fuck are you doing?

16:44.137 --> 16:47.405
- Oi! We can ball gag ya
or you can shut up.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.209
Just relax.
This is for your own good.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.858
See this? This is going
to go into your neck.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.626
And if you keep struggling

17:08.627 --> 17:10.627
you're gonna rip up
your own veins.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.896
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.002
- Keep still.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.575
Good. Good. Good.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.612
There's a good girl.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.259
- Is she good?

17:43.128 --> 17:45.063
- She's good.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.065
Let's put her out.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.917
What the fuck
did you do that for?

18:05.919 --> 18:09.353
- Looks like we're gonna
have to put her out
the old fashioned way, sarge.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.355
- Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.509
- Meganne, put your mask on.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.944
Get her mask on.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.179

18:35.181 --> 18:37.381

18:40.853 --> 18:42.653
Meganne! She's not breathing!

18:42.655 --> 18:44.856
<i>- Honey?

- No, he's not
a fucking zombie!

33:00.512 --> 33:02.746
- Oh, shit! Oh, fuck me!

33:03.648 --> 33:05.382
Is he alright?
Is he okay?

33:05.384 --> 33:07.417
- What do you fucking think?

33:07.419 --> 33:09.987
He's pretty fucking dead to me!

33:09.989 --> 33:11.788
- Oh, his head's fucked!

33:19.565 --> 33:22.199
Whoa! Hey, try this.

33:30.775 --> 33:32.342
- I'm keeping this.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.282
You comin' or what, mate?

33:40.718 --> 33:42.052
- Lead the way.

33:59.737 --> 34:01.505
- Boo-ya!

34:19.056 --> 34:21.625
Why are you awake?

34:25.931 --> 34:28.565
Ah! They're playing
my song.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.234
Will you excuse me?

34:45.349 --> 34:47.818
Good morning, sir!

34:52.690 --> 34:53.824
Ah!

34:54.525 --> 34:58.628
Ah! Ah! Ah!

35:34.199 --> 35:36.199
I'm just fucking with you.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.569
No, you're just due
for another top up.

35:54.652 --> 36:00.157
Now, you are one lucky, lucky,
lucky little girl.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.425
Because you've stayed up
past your bedtime

36:02.427 --> 36:05.362
you get to see
what the adults do after dark.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.099
Now hold still.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.435
Hold still!

36:16.440 --> 36:20.677
If I get this wrong, you could
go into a seizure and die.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.679
Huh?

36:22.947 --> 36:24.581
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.553
<i>- That's a good girl.</i>

36:29.555 --> 36:34.090
We only have to do this
five more times.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.637
- I want that truck.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.844
- Oi! Oi!

37:01.452 --> 37:03.220
Can we come inside?

37:03.222 --> 37:05.222
There's fucking zombies
everywhere.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.027
- Yeah, okay.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.900
- How do we get in?

37:25.209 --> 37:28.812
- Alright. Let them
get close to ya

37:28.814 --> 37:30.814
then run around 'em.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.551
- Okay.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.820
- Just make sure
that door comes up.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.429
- Run ya bastards!

38:07.418 --> 38:08.785
- Nice shootin', mate.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.387
- Thanks, mate.

38:18.396 --> 38:21.398
- There's a lot of good shit
in here we can use, ay?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.732
- What's that, mate?

38:24.502 --> 38:26.636
- That Hilux out in the front.
Which one of you...

38:26.638 --> 38:28.538
- That Hilux
ain't goin' nowhere.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.874
- Yeah? Why's that?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.542
- You drove
from the city, right?

38:32.544 --> 38:34.110
- Right.
- Where's your car?

38:34.112 --> 38:35.478
- Broke down.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.814
- Engine trouble?

38:38.949 --> 38:40.917
Yeah, right.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.019
I need to show
you boys somethin'.

38:50.528 --> 38:54.164
Petrol. Metho.
Kero.

38:54.598 --> 38:55.932
Right?

39:10.147 --> 39:14.117
Last time I checked
they were flammable liquids,
weren't they?

39:14.119 --> 39:15.485
- How old's that stuff?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.054
- Brand spanking new, mate.
We bought it last week.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.156
- So your car
just stopped, ay?

39:21.459 --> 39:23.560
- I guess that
would explain it.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.599
- What the fuck!
Who's that?

39:29.601 --> 39:32.235
- That's Neville.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.639
- Oh!

39:36.641 --> 39:40.643
That's fucking rank.
He's farting out of his mouth.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.545
- Weird, eh?

39:42.547 --> 39:43.980
- Oh, fuck him.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.018
- Night, Neville.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.839
- Whoa! Shit!
- What the fucking fuck?

40:19.683 --> 40:21.684
- The blood is flammable!

40:30.628 --> 40:32.896
- Oi, wake up, Neville.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.771
Come on.

40:45.676 --> 40:47.010
We need petrol, right?

40:47.012 --> 40:49.012
- Right.
- Wrong. We need fuel.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.917
- There's no way
that could work.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.919
- There's one way
to find out.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.522
- Let's get him out of there.

41:07.097 --> 41:10.166
- Alright, Kel,
give it a crank now.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.501
- Oh, fuck!

41:12.136 --> 41:14.304
Come on!

41:19.978 --> 41:21.544
You beauty.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.713
- Good on ya, Neville.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.449
- If we can get that truck
inside, we can definitely
hook him up.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.284
Drive the fuck out of here.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.586
- That's gonna be
a mission but, eh?

41:29.588 --> 41:31.221
- And it's doable.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.125
- We need to armor up.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.561
Big time.

41:49.907 --> 41:51.140
Fuck ya.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.766
- They're goin' for it!

42:22.740 --> 42:23.873
- Ready?

42:23.875 --> 42:26.843
- Born ready.
- Alright. Let's do this.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.060
- Come on you fuckin' zombies!

43:07.685 --> 43:08.751
I'm out!

43:08.753 --> 43:09.886
- Same!

43:48.993 --> 43:52.662
- Fuck! It bit it off! That
thing bit me fucking nose off!

43:52.664 --> 43:55.498
Frankie, how does it look, mate?
Is me nose gone?

43:55.500 --> 43:58.134
Is it bit off? Tell me, Frankie.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.303
- Yeah, there's not much
nose left, mate.

44:07.978 --> 44:09.312
Kel!

44:09.314 --> 44:12.382
- What is it?
- Your fuckin' eyes, mate!

44:12.384 --> 44:15.084
- What... what about me
fuckin' eyes, Frankie?
What's up with 'em?

44:15.086 --> 44:16.853
- Move out of the way, Frank.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.222
- Wait! Wait!
What're you fuckin' doing?

44:19.224 --> 44:21.691
- He's gonna turn any second.
- He's a mate!

44:27.131 --> 44:29.232
- Get some fucking rope, Frank!

44:38.976 --> 44:40.610
- This is bullshit.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.128
- What the fuck is that?

44:59.130 --> 45:03.399
- Well, this my friend,
is a gas-powered harpoon.

45:03.401 --> 45:06.736
I built it for a mate,
so he can hunt sharks in Perth.

45:06.738 --> 45:08.671
- Is that thing legal?

45:08.673 --> 45:09.739
- Don't be stupid.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.074
- Does it work?

45:16.480 --> 45:19.048
- I'd move out of the way
if I were you.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.561
- Fuck me! Bull's eye!

45:43.373 --> 45:47.443
- Once that door goes up,
that's it. We're on our way.

45:47.445 --> 45:48.978
Has everyone got
everything they need?

45:48.980 --> 45:50.146
- Yep.

45:50.148 --> 45:52.148
- Ready as we're gonna be.
- Righto.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.784
- Wait a minute!
Frank?

45:54.786 --> 45:56.753
- Yeah, mate?

45:56.755 --> 45:58.755
- Did you turn the stove off?

45:59.456 --> 46:00.590
- Right.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.592
Let it rip, Benny.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.089
- Hey!

47:41.458 --> 47:43.626
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

47:43.628 --> 47:45.628
- He fucking kicked me
in the balls!

47:47.297 --> 47:50.867
- Get him up on the wall and
get out of my lab, you moron!

48:11.188 --> 48:14.824
- You call me a moron again,
I'll fucking drop ya.

48:14.826 --> 48:17.994
- By which
you'll be demonstrating
your superior intellect.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.498
Good comeback!

48:37.848 --> 48:39.315
These people!

48:39.317 --> 48:40.349
Honestly!

49:14.217 --> 49:15.318
- Oi!

49:27.130 --> 49:29.131
- Should we stop for petrol?

51:08.899 --> 51:10.132
- I need to piss.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.369
I need to piss.

51:15.105 --> 51:17.907
- You're gonna have
to wait, mate.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.175
- Barry..

51:19.177 --> 51:23.012
That means pull the truck over
so I can urinate.

51:23.014 --> 51:25.681
- Can't you hold on?
We're nearly there.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.283
- Just be quick.

51:27.285 --> 51:28.551
- Mate, take the rifle.

51:29.753 --> 51:31.954
- Frank, I'm just taking
a piss, mate.

51:31.956 --> 51:33.489
- Take the fuckin' rifle.

51:35.158 --> 51:36.225
Fuck.

51:36.227 --> 51:38.060
- I can't hold the rifle

51:38.062 --> 51:41.797
and my massive cock
at the same time, Frank.

51:41.799 --> 51:45.668
But if you want to come out
and hold one of 'em,
I'll be flattered mate!

51:45.670 --> 51:46.936
<i>- Fuck off!</i>

51:50.608 --> 51:51.707
- Come on, Benny. Hurry up.

51:51.709 --> 51:53.676
- Don't pressure me, Barry.

51:53.678 --> 51:54.944
- It's getting dark out here.

51:55.912 --> 51:57.179
- Whoa.

52:00.684 --> 52:02.017
- Hurry up, Benny.

52:07.858 --> 52:08.924
- What the fuck!

52:13.130 --> 52:15.250
- Get back in the truck,
you fucking idiot!

52:17.768 --> 52:19.735
- So what did you learn?

52:19.737 --> 52:22.571
- Never get out of the truck!
- Let's get out of here.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.840
- Are you, uh, gonna put
your cock away first?

52:24.842 --> 52:25.875
- No!

52:26.743 --> 52:27.776
- Alright.

52:31.481 --> 52:33.182
- Oh, you're fucking joking!

52:33.184 --> 52:35.284
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

52:53.069 --> 52:54.336
- They're not making any gas.

52:55.305 --> 52:56.372
- He's empty you reckon?

52:56.374 --> 52:57.573
- Nah, he's not empty.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.841
Have a look at him.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.279
Last night was Neville
breathing the gas?

53:03.281 --> 53:05.981
- Nah, that only really
started up this morning.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.784
- It's getting dark, ay.

53:09.419 --> 53:10.452
- Yeah.

53:12.422 --> 53:14.422
- They stop breathing
the gas at night.

53:15.659 --> 53:17.193
- That's why they're faster.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.061
They're using it themselves.

53:21.998 --> 53:23.032
We're fucked!

53:26.470 --> 53:28.704
- Boys! Get in
the fucking truck!

53:28.706 --> 53:30.139
- Get in the truck, Frank.

53:30.141 --> 53:31.173
<i>Get in the truck.</i>

53:37.582 --> 53:38.622
Get your helmets on.

53:40.517 --> 53:41.550
Oh. Fuck me!

53:42.819 --> 53:44.353
It's gonna be a long night.

54:11.481 --> 54:13.916
- What do ya reckon, Frank?

54:13.918 --> 54:17.319
This is the worst fuckin'
nightmare of your life or what?

54:17.321 --> 54:19.188
- No fuckin' way, mate.

54:19.190 --> 54:21.230
- What the fuck
could be worse than this?

54:26.296 --> 54:28.497
- About 15 years ago

54:28.499 --> 54:30.799
the doctor told me my son
had brain cancer.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.770
He was only 7-years-old.

54:37.907 --> 54:39.575
Talk about shitting yourself.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.178
He died in my arms.

54:44.914 --> 54:46.448
<i>That was way worse than this.</i>

54:47.584 --> 54:49.285
This is fuckin' nothin'.

54:51.554 --> 54:53.474
- Sorry to hear
about that, Frank.

54:53.723 --> 54:55.157
- Yeah, well.

54:55.159 --> 54:56.725
These things happen, ay.

54:56.727 --> 54:57.793
Baz?

55:03.066 --> 55:04.986
- So what I've been
wondering is...

55:08.672 --> 55:10.205
How come we're not like them?

55:11.274 --> 55:12.541
How come we never turned?

55:14.277 --> 55:15.678
- Wyrmwood.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.146
- What?

55:17.148 --> 55:18.947
- You never read the Bible?

55:18.949 --> 55:20.115
- Nah, man.

55:20.117 --> 55:21.383
I don't read that shit.

55:23.453 --> 55:25.321
In Revelations

55:25.323 --> 55:28.357
when the third angel
blows his trumpet.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.659
A star called Wyrmwood
falls to the Earth

55:30.661 --> 55:33.562
bringing a disease that kills
a fuckload of people.

55:35.065 --> 55:38.033
That's pretty much the beginning
of the end Biblically speaking.

55:40.770 --> 55:45.274
When I seen those
meteor showers last night..

55:45.276 --> 55:49.912
...and then in the morning all
these dead bastards come
running outta the bushes

55:49.914 --> 55:53.074
I figured we were pretty
deep into that final
judgment, you know?

55:54.050 --> 55:55.570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.221
When the end comes

55:59.223 --> 56:02.558
all the good folks go upstairs,
and all the bad folks
go downstairs

56:02.560 --> 56:05.361
and there's a bunch of poor
bastards left in the middle.

56:07.797 --> 56:09.131
- What happens to them?

56:10.600 --> 56:12.835
- They undergo a trial by fire.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.270
They get tested by God.

56:17.006 --> 56:19.608
- So you reckon
we're being tested right now?

56:19.610 --> 56:22.177
- Yeah.
I reckon we are.

56:24.414 --> 56:27.383
- I fucking hate tests.

56:27.385 --> 56:30.085
- I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

56:30.087 --> 56:34.256
If one of them bastards
gets in here and kills me,
wake us up, will you?

57:16.834 --> 57:19.334
Aah! What the fuck...
what the fuck's going on?

57:26.709 --> 57:28.444
- Fuck!
- Is that fire?

57:28.446 --> 57:29.978
- What happened?
- I don't know.

57:29.980 --> 57:32.047
I shot one of them in the face
and the fucker lit up.

57:32.049 --> 57:33.615
- What?
What did you do that for?

57:33.617 --> 57:36.485
- Fuck.
- If that fire reaches
the compressor, we're stuffed.

57:36.487 --> 57:38.520
- You think
I don't know that, Frank?

57:38.522 --> 57:40.689
I'm going up there.
- No, you're fucking not.

57:40.691 --> 57:42.524
There's a shitload of them
things out there, mate.

57:42.526 --> 57:44.159
- What else am I gonna do?

57:45.795 --> 57:48.096
Look, I'm gonna go out there
and put the fire out.

57:48.098 --> 57:49.164
Fuck those things!

57:49.166 --> 57:50.332
- Take the helmet.

57:50.334 --> 57:51.633
Put it on.

57:58.274 --> 58:00.542
- Let's do this.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.346
- Fuck you!

58:04.348 --> 58:06.114
- You ugly fuckers!

58:37.013 --> 58:38.313
- Barry!

58:38.315 --> 58:39.915
What the fuck's going on?

58:39.917 --> 58:40.917
- Fuck.

58:44.087 --> 58:45.153
- Barry!

58:51.227 --> 58:53.495
- Ah!

59:16.019 --> 59:17.319
- Lock it!

59:29.433 --> 59:31.633
- Fuck!

59:31.635 --> 59:33.769
<i>- Frank, did it bite you?</i>

59:33.771 --> 59:36.438
Frank! Did it bite you, mate?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.774
- The medical box.
- Ay?

59:38.776 --> 59:40.208
- The fucking...

59:40.210 --> 59:42.411
The fucking medical box
at your feet!

59:42.413 --> 59:43.879
- Oh.

59:43.881 --> 59:46.949
You want some bandages?

59:46.951 --> 59:49.885
- Open it.

59:49.887 --> 59:52.187
- Oh, beers.

59:52.189 --> 59:55.824
You want a beer, Frank?
- What do you fucking reckon?

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:04.600
Take a drink.

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:05.968
Take a fucking drink!

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:12.107
- Gimme some.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.179
- I can't do it.

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:22.851
I'm Catholic. I can't do it.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.853
Come on, mate!

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.190
It's okay.

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:29.891
It's alright.

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.094
<i>I've had a good life.</i>

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:34.029
<i>Just make sure</i>

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:37.399
you do it
while I'm still me, yep.

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.501
- I'm really sorry, mate.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.336
- Fucking do it!

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.652
- Mind if I finish this?

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.813
- Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, fuck man.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.550
Fuck off, meathead.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:31.620
Oh, I think I'm gonna spew.

01:01:31.622 --> 01:01:33.522
I've got a pounding hangover.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.360
Oh, nice one.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.596
- Gimme a hand with Frank.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:45.701
Come on.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.770
- Nice one!

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:52.474
- Let's get
the fuck out of here, ay!

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:54.743
- Yeah.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:55.777
Let's do it.

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:52.000
- You gonna say something?

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.002
- What's there to say?

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.882
- What was that?

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:09.184
- He's safe now.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:12.254
That crow will come
and take his spirit.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:13.256
- Nice.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.134
Come on, let's go.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.728
- You boys military?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.730
- Yeah.

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.101
- You guys know
what's been going on here?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.303
- You fellas A negative
- What?

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:11.539
- 'Course they're
fucking A negative, Thommo.
- What's he talking about?

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:15.677
- All we know is
there's something in the air
that's changing people.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.747
Anyone with an A negative blood
type is unaffected.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.415
That's obviously you, fellas.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.051
People with any other
blood type..

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:25.587
...not so lucky.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:28.089
So where are you boys headed?

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.391
- North.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:33.194
- We're going to Bulla Bulla.
- Bulla Bulla? Why?

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:34.429
- To get his sister.

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:40.001
- That's a pretty bad idea.
We've just come
from Bulla Bulla.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:42.637
It's not looking good
there's infected everywhere.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, fellas!

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:52.213
Alright, look,
we're all friends here, okay?

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:54.416
We got a call from our captain
about 10 minutes ago

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:57.852
and now, he's in a roving unit,
just down the road, okay?

01:05:57.854 --> 01:06:00.689
Now, he said, he picked up
a couple of
A negative blood types.

01:06:00.691 --> 01:06:03.091
Survivors just like you two.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.995
What was your sister's name?

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.033
- Brooke.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:13.268
- Yeah, right.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.570
I'm pretty sure
one of them was Brooke.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.243
Well, how about I go
and radio our captain
and confirm that for you, huh?

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:24.245
- Yeah, you do that.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.859
- Well, they've definitely
got a Brooke.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:39.894
- Well, I wanna speak
to whoever's on that radio.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.963
- Listen, now you hear me out.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:47.702
Just relax, hop back
in your car and I will take you
to your sister.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.938
- Just tell me where she is.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.007
- Look, mate, I don't even have
time for this shit, alright?

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.442
There are about a million things
that I have to do right now.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:57.645
And you boys, you're pretty low
on my priority list.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:07:00.715
So hop back in your car,
and you follow me or don't.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.886
You're choice.
Thommo, we're rolling.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:06.888
Well, what's it gonna be?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.863
- We'll follow you.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:20.535
- They seem like nice blokes..

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.737
..or not.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:26.074
- I don't like it.
- Don't like what?

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.876
- Don't know.

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:29.878
That guy's full of shit.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.341
- Fuck.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.825
It's time.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.216
You!

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.624
- What the fuck?

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.627
Those lying fucks.
That's Brooke!

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.064
Brooke!

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.066
- Barry?

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.405
Oh, shit!

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.076
- Quick!

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:36.078
Jump!

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.212
Jump!

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:41.349
<i>Quickly!</i>

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:46.287
Shit!
- They're shooting at us!

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.388
- Go! Go! Go!

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:52.927
- Hold on!

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.512
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.551
Fuck!
- What's that sound?

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:19.420
- Come on!
- What's the problem?

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:20.822
- I don't know.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.069
You okay?

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.278
What happened back there?

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.182
- Oh, fuck me dead, Barry!

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:50.251
They blew this joker's head off.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:51.552
- Shit.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:53.354
We need to find a zombie fast.

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:55.590
- Zombie? What do
we need a zombie for?

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.925
- This truck
runs on zombies.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.660
No zombies, no truck.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:04.165
- Come on, you dead bastards!

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.266
Come and get it!

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.668
Where are ya?

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.344
- You want a zombie?

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.274
- Yeah.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:14.876
- I'll get you a zombie.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:15.878
<i>- Fuck!</i>

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.996
- Brooke, what the fuck's
wrong with your eyes?

01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:47.208
- Don't shoot him.

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.113
Shit!

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.583
- Alright, what the fuck
just happened then?

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:57.218
- Where do you want him?

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.488
- Back of the truck.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.740
- She can control
fucking zombies!

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.889
- What?

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.341
- Come on.

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:06.854
- What are we waiting for?
- We need mask on
that thing's mouth.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:09.557
- What mask?
- The mask!
The blue fucking mask!

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.195
- Okay. Go!

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.060
- The joke's on me now, bro.

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.164
- You okay?

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.332
- Nah I'm fucked.

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:58.339
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.941
- Putting pressure on the
wound. It'll stop the bleeding.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.544
- Just fuckin'
warn me next time, ay?

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:04.546
- Sorry.

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:13.120
- You're better-looking
than your brother.

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:14.122
- So are you.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.593
I'm Brooke.

01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:20.895
- I know.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:21.897
I'm Benny.

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:26.901
- Thanks for helping
me out back there, Benny.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.603
- No problem, darling.

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:32.206
Nice to finally meet ya.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:35.242
I wish I could say
I'd heard a lot about ya.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:39.513
But your brother there is
a bit of a tight-lipped bastard.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:43.718
- Yeah.

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:47.688
- I guess it
runs in the family.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.660
- Hey, Barry?

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.031
Where's Annie and Megan?

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.536
- They're dead.

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.624
- My brother Mulla

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:27.495
he's up there in the trees
laughing at me the bastard.

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:30.297
- Barry, we're gonna have
to pull over. Benny's not good.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:32.099
- Fuck.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.368
Alright, I'm gonna
pull off road.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.791
There you go, mate.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.094
- It's a nice day for it.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.465
Oi! I want you
to leave me here, bro.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:05.699
- Don't be stupid.

01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:06.834
- Listen to me.

01:20:06.836 --> 01:20:09.436
Just give me a gun
and plenty of bullets.

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:10.971
I can take care of meself.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.173
- I know you can, mate.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:14.255
There's no bloody way
I'm leavin' you here.

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.444
Let's take a look
at this thing, ay?

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:22.216
Shit.

01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:27.721
- You two gotta
keep moving, you know that.

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:29.323
- Fuck that bullshit.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:32.126
We're gonna patch you up and
we're all leaving here together.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.528
- No, I'm not getting
back in that truck.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:35.696
- Yeah, you are.

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:37.998
Brooke?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.500
Brooky!

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:41.836
Brooke!

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:43.737
You alright?

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.407
Oh, God! Fuck me! No.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:50.945
- Something's happening to me.

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.181
- Come here.

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.424
I killed them both.

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.728
- Could you do it for me?

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:10.397
- I don't know if I can.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.102
- Give me the gun.

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.582
- Will you hold my hand?

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.081
- Give me the gun.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.852
Run! Go! Come on fuckheads!

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.324
<i>- Wakey, wakey.</i>

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:24.571
Call to your sister.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.876
- Go fuck yourself!

01:22:28.878 --> 01:22:29.878
- Thompson.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.185
<i>Rubber bullets.</i>

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:40.387
They pack quite
a punch though, don't they?

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:43.190
You wanna know what
the real one feels like, mate?

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:45.993
- The real one
feels like shit, Barry.

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:48.062
<i>- Call to your sister.</i>

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:49.296
- Nah, she'll be right.

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:54.535
- Go and get the pliers.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:04.178
- Call to your sister.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.180
- Fuck you!

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:25.332
- Fuck me!

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.402
You ever seen 'em move that fast
in the daytime before, boss?

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.605
- McLaughlin.

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.774
<i>- Yes, boss.</i>
- Take another nail out.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:34.776
- Stop!

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:40.881
- Oh, shit.

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.927
<i>- Put 'em on.</i>

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.581
- Ah, fuck this shit!

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.050
Come on!

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:19.787
- Leave her alone,
you fucking bastards.

01:24:19.789 --> 01:24:21.055
- Shut up, dickhead.

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:25.659
- Easy, easy.
Sorry about him.

01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:27.661
- Listen up.

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:31.065
They want us to take the girl's
head off and chuck it in the
icebox for later.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.502
- Fuck yeah.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:37.905
- Actually, boss, I've got
just the thing for this.

01:24:37.907 --> 01:24:40.174
It's over in the truck.
- Go and get it now.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:43.177
- Hey, Benny.

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:44.478
You got those matches
on you mate?

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.646
- Yeah.

01:24:45.648 --> 01:24:46.780
- Gimme 'em, ay?

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.182
- Why?

01:24:48.184 --> 01:24:49.683
- I'm gonna take us all out.

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:51.618
- Ay?

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.121
- See that compressor
up there?

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:55.923
I'm gonna blow it up.

01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:58.225
Be like a fucking
atom bomb went off.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:04.598
- Can we talk about
a possible alternative?

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.070
- We got no time, mate.

01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:12.005
We're dead anyway,
you know that.

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:13.974
- I got a better idea.

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:15.442
- Fuck's sake, what?

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:19.580
- I let him up there bite me.

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.917
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:27.287
- I've got a number 7
killer boomerang hidden
under the truck.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.989
Sharp as fuck.

01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:30.671
- A boomerang?
- Yeah.

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:45.472
- Your sister,
she can control zombies.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.740
- Yeah, so?

01:25:46.742 --> 01:25:50.077
- So, I'll be a zombie.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.133
That bloke she killed
over there..

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.483
...his gun.

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.353
- What?

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:02.789
- Benny, give me
the fucking matches. Now.

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:06.660
- You want a head taken off?

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.228
You use a fuckin' sword.

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:10.931
- Where the fuck
did you get that?

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:12.032
- Who cares?

01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:13.300
Let's get this done.

01:26:13.302 --> 01:26:15.135
- Fuck yeah, boss.

01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:17.177
- Leave her alone,
you fucking bastards.

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:21.074
<i>Fuckin' touch her...</i>

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:23.010
Benny they're about to chop
my sister's fucking head off.

01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:24.411
Now give me
the fucking matches.

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:25.512
- What about my idea?

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.114
- What about your idea?
You're rambling.

01:26:27.116 --> 01:26:28.415
You're not making
any fucking sense, mate.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.716
- I'm rambling, am I?

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:31.084
- Give me the
fucking matches, Benny.

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:32.686
- McLaughlin, you help me
hold her down?

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.721
Thompson, you're cutting.

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:35.889
- With pleasure, boss.

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.051
- You want the matches?
- For fuck's sake, now.

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:39.960
- Here's the matches.

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.429
- Fucking wanker.

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.366
Come on.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.143
- Come here, you bastard.

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:09.308
- You're going down,
ball buster.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.434
- One.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:27.507
<i>Two.</i>

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.648
Three.

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:03.377
- Drop the gun or they attack.

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:16.056
- No!

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:24.598
No!

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.134
No!

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.303
<i>No!</i>

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.306
<i>You fuckers!</i>

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:50.023
- Ah, fuck!

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.695
- I'm guessing you're not
an A negative blood type, mate.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:59.633
You're done, son.
Just a matter of time.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.010
- Well played.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:17.517
There's more at stake here
than you know, mate.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:23.123
It's not about you,
or you sister, or your mates.

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:26.760
It's about the survival
of the human fucking race, mate!

01:29:26.762 --> 01:29:27.961
Do you understand?

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:29.763
- You're a piece of shit.

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.908
- You wanna fight me, mate?

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:44.010
- I wanna rip
your fucking head off.

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:53.286
- Fuck it.

01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:55.188
You and me go round and round.

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:09.069
Come on then,
take a fucking swing.

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.665
Come on.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:47.240
Come on, mate. Don't you fucking
pussy out on me now. Stand up.

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:50.577
Good boy.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:18.472
Now, I could snap your fucking
neck in half, right now.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.640
Oh, you...

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.276
Oh, fuck!

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:36.923
Never... never ever..

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:39.826
...grab a man's balls
in a fist fight.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.461
It shows low character.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.631
- What about using a gun?

01:31:44.633 --> 01:31:46.166
You're a fucking dog.

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:48.768
- Dog, am I?

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.203
You're the fucking dog, mate.

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:52.572
Jesus Christ.

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.877
Fuckin', this shit is over,
mate, alright?

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.380
I'm telling ya,
some blokes..

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:02.849
...just don't know..

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.417
...when..

01:32:04.419 --> 01:32:05.485
...to quit.

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.123
Well, there you go.

01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:11.758
You're right back
where you started.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.194
Didn't exactly rip my fucking
head off did ya, mate?

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.663
Fuck, hey.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.235
Shit.

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:31.545
They are fucking disgusting.

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:35.949
<i>Where are you going mate?</i>

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:37.417
You were doing so fucking well.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:43.290
Now what are you
going to do with those?

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:13.920
- Oi!

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.347
- What the fuck?

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:23.189
Get on the fucking ground
and put your hands on your head.

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:26.993
- So, what's in the truck?

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:29.062
- Get down
on the fucking ground now!

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.164
- Wrong answer.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.712
- You mother fuckers.
