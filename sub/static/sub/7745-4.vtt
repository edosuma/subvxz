00:08.718 --> 00:10.303
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.387 --> 00:14.015
Technically, it's a studio plus.

00:14.099 --> 00:16.518
It's great. I mean it. Sign the paper.

00:16.601 --> 00:19.604
You need to get out of my face, okay?

00:21.439 --> 00:22.732
See you on the outside?

00:24.693 --> 00:25.819
Charlie. This is Jackie.

00:25.902 --> 00:29.030
Listen, I am calling you,
and you have to call me back.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.532
Charlie?

00:32.534 --> 00:34.327
No, I just came in here to talk to my friend.

00:34.411 --> 00:37.455
I would love to sit down with you someday
and sign some document

00:37.539 --> 00:39.833
that would clarify just what the fuck we are.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.919
I don't know what I came in here for.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.463
Okay, real quick.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.924
Take it in.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.300
I'm sorry, are you flirting with me?

00:49.592 --> 00:50.635
Well, that just killed it.

00:52.262 --> 00:55.265
So, do you want to do this again?
Because I do.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.601
I am a recovering drug addict.

00:58.935 --> 01:01.062
So it's a date.

02:22.352 --> 02:24.729
Well, hello, Officer.
What are you doing here?

02:24.813 --> 02:27.899
I had such a good time with you last night,
I bought you a gift.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.527
Hope you saved the receipt.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.363
What are we looking at?

02:33.446 --> 02:36.032
Steve here took someone's rowboat
for a joyride.

02:36.282 --> 02:37.700
Bad idea on many levels.

02:37.784 --> 02:38.993
Isn't Bellevue closer?

02:39.077 --> 02:41.871
Last I checked, they don't have
a nurse there named Jackie Peyton.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.458
Need warming blankets and an IV.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.170
You spent an extra 10 minutes

02:49.254 --> 02:51.881
with a potential hypothermia victim
in the back of your squad car

02:51.965 --> 02:53.299
just so you could see me?

02:53.383 --> 02:56.344
Well, when you put it like that,
it does sound a little irresponsible.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.388
Yeah. You kidding?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.348
So, what's the word, Doc?

03:00.431 --> 03:03.393
Frostbite, mild hypothermia.
Lucky you pulled him out when you did.

03:03.476 --> 03:06.855
All right, I'm gonna need to book him.
So, ironic, isn't it?

03:07.063 --> 03:08.690
Warm a guy up just to put him in the cooler.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.441
Come back around 5:00. He'll be good to go.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.068
All right, thank you.

03:12.151 --> 03:16.531
Hey, listen. I was thinking,
coffee went so good, we'll work backwards.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.075
We'll have dessert and then dinner.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.577
Can I let you know about that?

03:20.660 --> 03:22.370
That's good.
You don't want to appear too eager.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.247
- No.
- So, what do you think?

03:30.962 --> 03:32.547
I think that cop likes you.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.007
We are running low on syringes.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.842
And I think you like him, too.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.886
What are we, in seventh grade?

03:37.969 --> 03:40.054
How was your first night in the apartment?

03:40.513 --> 03:44.434
The heat randomly turns on.
Most of the outlets don't work.

03:44.559 --> 03:46.895
I love it so much.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.148
Morning, Zoey.

03:52.901 --> 03:55.278
Really? We're gonna do this now?

04:00.617 --> 04:04.954
Okay. So, Chief of ER, right?
I come in this morning to run my checks.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.625
Patient follow-up, check. Supplies, check.
Nurse schedule.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.795
Did you hear a "check"? No.
No, you didn't hear a check. You know why?

04:12.879 --> 04:15.298
Because someone forgot to schedule
any nurses for the day shift tomorrow

04:15.381 --> 04:16.966
or the late shift tomorrow night.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.385
- No nurses scheduled for two shifts.
- Check.

04:20.053 --> 04:21.387
Who's responsible for this?

04:23.806 --> 04:25.058
That would be me.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.185
<i>You'?</i>

04:27.268 --> 04:29.437
Okay, so you sure
someone didn't forget something?

04:30.021 --> 04:31.189
Again?

04:31.272 --> 04:33.399
Okay, you want this one on you, that's fine.

04:33.483 --> 04:36.152
But I am this close to reporting
her absentminded ass to the board.

04:37.487 --> 04:42.075
Jane Doe, BP 103 over 70.
Heart rate, 70 BPM. Shallow respiration.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.118
No clue where she's at or what's happening.

04:44.202 --> 04:46.788
Honey, can you tell me your name?

04:47.997 --> 04:50.416
Honey, can you hear me?

04:52.251 --> 04:55.713
Stoned out of her mind.
Get a blood panel and a urine tox.

04:55.797 --> 04:57.423
- Check.
- I'll be back.

05:04.389 --> 05:07.141
No. Honey, I need you to keep
this on for me, okay. Can you do that?

05:08.059 --> 05:09.560
I see a wedding ring.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.521
We're gonna try to find your husband, okay?

05:12.438 --> 05:14.357
Zoey, you got your phone?

05:29.998 --> 05:35.586
I just saw a patient with toes so fucked up,
his socks were fused to his feet.

05:35.670 --> 05:39.048
Gangrene? Did you run an IV of antibiotics?

05:39.132 --> 05:42.635
No, no, it was Dr. Prentiss's patient.
I just saw him.

05:42.719 --> 05:44.804
I hate feet.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.724
Listen, Carrie,
after what happened yesterday,

05:47.807 --> 05:50.143
I'm thinking dinner?

05:50.226 --> 05:51.644
Wait, help me out.
What happened yesterday?

05:51.728 --> 05:53.229
You grabbed his package.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.355
Right.

05:54.439 --> 05:57.650
I mean, we already have things going.

05:57.734 --> 06:00.445
Yeah. Yeah, I would totally go.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.656
I do have plans tonight.
Head of cardiology. Sorry.

06:05.241 --> 06:07.910
You two give groping a bad name.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.876
What do you want, Jackie?

06:15.126 --> 06:18.588
You asked for a document
that defines our relationship? Okay.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.302
Jesus, you wanna be friends.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.847
Okay, give me your finger
'cause we'll need blood for this, right?

06:27.930 --> 06:31.100
I'm serious, Eddie.
This is what I need right now.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.020
Fuck.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.189
It's fucking dumb.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.115
It's all right.

06:47.950 --> 06:51.704
Oh, my God. Sorry.

06:51.788 --> 06:53.206
- Sorry.
- Jesus, Zoey.

06:53.289 --> 06:55.333
Sorry.

06:55.416 --> 06:59.629
Are you two back together, together?

07:00.213 --> 07:01.839
Just come in.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.429
No luck matching Jane Doe to the photos.

07:08.721 --> 07:13.267
Okay, call the cops and see
if anyone's reported a missing person.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.146
Any particular cop?

07:30.076 --> 07:32.662
Honey, you need to keep this on.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.539
Is she able to tell you who she is yet?

07:35.039 --> 07:37.416
No. No, it's weird.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.586
Got a nice manicure, nice clothes.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.255
Honey, are you messing with your meds?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.882
What did you take?

07:45.967 --> 07:47.885
I should call social services.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.849
-It's my kid's school.
- Take it. I got this.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.270
Hello?

07:57.353 --> 07:58.896
Speaking.

08:00.273 --> 08:02.316
Acting out? How?

08:04.318 --> 08:07.113
Okay. Let me call you back. Thanks.

08:08.698 --> 08:10.449
Problem, they want me right now.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.701
Go. I'll take over here.

08:12.076 --> 08:16.664
It's all right. She's coming right back.
Don't worry.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.332
- Social services.
- Got it.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.135
You good?

08:30.595 --> 08:31.846
Why wouldn't I be?

08:36.893 --> 08:38.686
Yes, Sergeant.

08:39.604 --> 08:43.149
Fine. How long before you know
if there's a match?

08:44.233 --> 08:48.821
Well, how many people
could you possibly have missing?

08:48.905 --> 08:51.699
28,000. Okay, I'll hold.

08:53.075 --> 08:57.788
Okay, I gave stitches
to that elderly lady in bay three.

08:57.872 --> 09:01.584
Old people skin. It is like wet newspaper.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.087
You still wanna hang out or whatever?

09:05.171 --> 09:07.089
What happened to your cardiologist?

09:07.173 --> 09:10.635
Something about an emergency
mitral valve prolapse and priorities.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.180
He's a dick. So, whatever. Nobu, 8:00-ish?

09:20.061 --> 09:21.479
Still free.

09:28.611 --> 09:33.115
We've all noticed a gradual change
in Fiona's behavior and grades,

09:33.199 --> 09:37.036
but this is the first time
she's ever been disrespectful to a teacher.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.622
Exactly how was she disrespectful?

09:39.705 --> 09:43.292
Fiona called Miss King an "a-hole."

09:45.503 --> 09:47.630
Highly disrespectful.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.966
Where'd you learn that word?

09:50.258 --> 09:53.427
From when you and Mom yell at each other.

10:00.226 --> 10:03.229
Oh, God. She's so little.

10:04.814 --> 10:07.358
Please tell me we didn't break her.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.944
We did, a little.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.406
But we can put her back together.

10:15.533 --> 10:16.575
Truce?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.287
Yeah.

10:22.081 --> 10:25.835
Look, honey, I know there have been
a lot of changes lately,

10:25.918 --> 10:27.753
but things are gonna quiet down.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.213
It's gonna get easier.

10:29.297 --> 10:31.590
We're gonna... Grace?

10:33.843 --> 10:36.595
What are you doing
coming out of the subway?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.889
Dad signed me up for dance classes.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.182
She has a boyfriend.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.935
Okay.

10:43.019 --> 10:44.353
Let's try this again with the truth.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.024
A boyfriend?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.402
Danny.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.948
Okay, tell me you were not at his house.

10:56.032 --> 10:59.118
No, I was at Union Square.
That's where he plays.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.828
Union Square, Manhattan?

11:00.911 --> 11:04.206
Yes, he's a musician.
He just made almost $10.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.752
Your boyfriend plays for change
in Union Square?

11:08.210 --> 11:10.004
Okay, how old is he?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.841
Seventeen.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.926
Okay.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.430
Taxi. Come with me.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.319
Question about tonight.

11:33.611 --> 11:34.779
Sure.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.905
I can't make it.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.035
I know. it sucks, right?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.412
My date with the head of cardiology
is back on.

11:43.496 --> 11:46.082
Turns out he didn't have
any prolapse surgery.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.460
He had dinner with his wife,
but now she canceled.

11:50.086 --> 11:54.256
Don't you hate liars?
That is why I am being straight up.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.426
- We had plans.
- Seriously.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.888
I feel so jerked around by that guy.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.307
No oral for him.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.477
Well, maybe.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.483
I have no feeling below my waist.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.735
Consider yourself lucky.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.113
So we ground her for a week
and we dock her allowance.

12:17.530 --> 12:18.614
Sounds right.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.157
You always say that and then you cave.

12:20.241 --> 12:21.992
<i>I thought the idea was a unified front.</i>

12:22.076 --> 12:24.412
- Same page.
<i>- Yes, I'm sorry. You're right.</i>

12:24.495 --> 12:26.080
You're right.

12:26.831 --> 12:30.042
An apology. This is new.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.919
How about that? Gold star for me, huh?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.462
<i>- Gotta go.
- Bye.</i>

12:34.588 --> 12:35.798
So, how's our Jane Doe?

12:37.675 --> 12:38.801
Where is our Jane Doe?

12:38.884 --> 12:41.971
I sent her up to neurology for a CAT scan.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.181
Or was it digital imaging for an MRI?

12:44.265 --> 12:45.766
Gloria.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.352
- Hey, you left. Things got busy.
- Did you call social services?

12:48.436 --> 12:51.605
Yes, voice-mail, and until they find the time
to call me back,

12:51.689 --> 12:53.691
I'm just handling her medical needs.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.610
Okay, great. So where is she?

12:56.694 --> 12:59.280
Give me a minute. It'll come to me.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.412
She's not in neuro or digital imaging.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.581
Social services isn't answering.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.332
They're on the fucking 9th floor
of this building.

13:10.416 --> 13:13.252
Go up there and kick some ass.
Then comb the hospital.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.213
Do not stop until you find her.
Marta, give him a hand, please.

13:16.297 --> 13:17.631
Where's my Jane Doe?

13:18.466 --> 13:20.259
If you want to go up to neuro
and have the guys work faster,

13:20.342 --> 13:21.677
please be my guest.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.432
I did it.

13:29.435 --> 13:33.355
I found Jane Doe's husband, and he's here.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.236
Hi, honey.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.114
<i>Okay, Mom.
Checking in every 20 minutes like you said.</i>

13:42.198 --> 13:44.033
Show me you're home.
Let me see the living room.

13:46.702 --> 13:49.163
<i>God, Mom, why don't you just get me
one of those ankle bracelets</i>

13:49.246 --> 13:50.581
<i>that prisoners have to wear?</i>

13:50.664 --> 13:53.042
Yeah, maybe for Christmas.
All right, honey. Thanks.

13:54.335 --> 13:57.004
Mr. Farrell, meet Jackie Peyton.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.507
She is the nurse
who's been caring for your wife.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.634
God, I can't tell you how grateful I am.
Thank you.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.511
Please. There's no need to thank, really.

14:03.928 --> 14:06.931
I can't believe you actually found her.
She left her cell phone, her bag.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.224
I mean, what are the odds?

14:08.390 --> 14:10.976
- One in 28,000.
- Yeah, who'd a thunk?

14:11.060 --> 14:12.978
Jennifer has mental health issues.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.480
Depression.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.149
I took a leave of absence from my firm
till we could get her back on track,

14:17.233 --> 14:18.275
but this morning I had a deposition.

14:18.359 --> 14:21.529
I got home, I had no idea where she was.
Do you know how that feels?

14:21.612 --> 14:22.905
No, I can't imagine.

14:23.489 --> 14:25.407
- Can I see her?
- You bet.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.327
Yes, she's up in imaging right now.
So, if you don't mind,

14:28.410 --> 14:29.537
why don't you have a seat
in the waiting room?

14:29.620 --> 14:32.248
I can have someone bring you the forms
that you need to fill out, okay?

14:32.540 --> 14:34.792
Right through there. Thank you.

14:37.253 --> 14:39.463
You always tell me the paperwork can wait.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.006
Akalitus lost her.

14:41.257 --> 14:45.970
What? No. We just found her.
How can I help?

14:46.095 --> 14:48.305
Just keep Prentiss away from me, please.
He's been here five minutes,

14:48.389 --> 14:50.057
he's already threatening
to turn her over to the board.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.393
He's naturally very drawn to me,
so no problem.

14:52.935 --> 14:57.189
Good. I'm gonna go see
if I can jog her memory or what's left of it.

15:25.593 --> 15:26.635
Problem?

15:27.720 --> 15:30.889
I don't know.
I think I have something in my eye.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.391
Would you mind taking a look?

15:34.768 --> 15:35.811
Look up.

15:37.605 --> 15:38.689
With your eye.

15:40.316 --> 15:42.943
Now look over here. Look over here.

15:43.652 --> 15:44.653
And up.

15:45.613 --> 15:46.655
And down.

15:46.739 --> 15:49.325
So, see anything?

15:59.543 --> 16:00.711
Where's Akalitus?

16:00.836 --> 16:03.922
They dragged her off to an HR meeting.
Everybody wants a piece.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.091
I know she's a former nurse
and you all look out for each other.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.635
I also know that I don't give a shit.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.178
Right. This has all been very informative.

16:09.261 --> 16:14.016
Hey, we all have jobs to do, okay?
And I cannot do my job without my patient.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.357
Hey.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.484
Jane Doe's labs.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.361
Shit!

16:25.444 --> 16:26.779
Yeah, no, shit, shit.

16:26.862 --> 16:30.074
It's like four times the normal amount
for someone her size.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.786
How can a person have this much Xanax and
Nembutal in their system and still function?

16:33.869 --> 16:37.873
She can't. No one could, not even you.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.792
Her husband had no idea she was using.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.211
Please, no one's that stupid.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.755
Well...

16:45.547 --> 16:48.509
I don't mean to pile on,
but you kind of look like hell.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.886
One friend to another.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.014
Yeah, Fi's mouthing off at school.
She's failing math.

16:54.098 --> 16:57.643
Grace is chasing after older boys. It's...

16:57.726 --> 16:59.978
Anything I can do?

17:00.062 --> 17:02.022
Yeah. This.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.033
Why am I suddenly in a church?

17:13.117 --> 17:17.037
It's a chapel. It's peaceful, sacred, safe.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.915
You're making me nervous.
Why can't I see my wife?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.668
Well, I need to tell you something
about your wife.

17:22.751 --> 17:23.794
Oh, God.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.338
I think she's a drug addict.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.174
Jesus, seriously? No, she's sick.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.634
Well, if you'd listen to me for one minute,
I can...

17:30.718 --> 17:32.344
No, you listen to me.

17:32.428 --> 17:34.346
I've been with my wife every day,

17:34.430 --> 17:37.558
taking care of her,
holding her while she's screaming.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.226
If this were about drugs, I would know.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.771
I think you'd be surprised the lengths
a drug addict will go to, to keep a secret.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.690
And you're the fucking expert?

17:44.773 --> 17:48.610
Actually, I am, 'cause I'm a drug addict.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.740
<i>So, Charlie Cruz, that's my day of shit.</i>

17:53.866 --> 17:57.202
Anyway, I had to call 'cause I'm feeling so...

18:00.622 --> 18:02.541
Fuck. I gotta go.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.638
Jack. Bad news, Steve's in deep shit.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.141
The owner of the boat is pressing charges.
There's nothing I can do.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.352
But the good news is, I'm here early.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.313
I am so sorry. I got... I have...

18:24.396 --> 18:26.648
I get it, I get it. Okay, get out of here.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.859
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.239
- We looked everywhere.
- Even the morgue.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.574
Did you call social services?

18:35.657 --> 18:38.452
I went up to the office.
They said Akalitus didn't even call them.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.704
This is un-fucking-believable.
I gave her one thing to do.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.581
She can't remember
to make a fucking phone call?

18:42.664 --> 18:45.417
Can someone please explain to me
how you lose a patient?

18:45.501 --> 18:47.169
I didn't lose a patient.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.422
I hid one.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.928
Jesus, thank God.
I am so sorry about all this.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.346
Are you okay, honey?

18:57.429 --> 18:59.431
Now, thanks to her.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.184
Jackie Peyton, meet Jennifer Farrell.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.025
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:10.108 --> 19:13.403
That same fucking concerned hubby
in the waiting room?

19:13.487 --> 19:16.281
He's been drugging her.
His first two wives left him.

19:16.365 --> 19:18.116
He wanted to make sure this one didn't, too.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.829
Holy shit. That son of a bitch.
He almost cried.

19:21.912 --> 19:24.289
I knew something was wrong
when I mentioned her husband

19:24.373 --> 19:25.457
and she tried to bolt.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.001
But the clincher was when I showed her
the Xanax and the Nembutal.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.253
She didn't know what they were.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.215
Why are you giving me that look?

19:33.465 --> 19:36.176
I don't know.
You're keeping things from me.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.970
Jackie, this isn't strictly legal.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.515
I didn't need you risking your job, too,
but I had to help this woman.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.809
Social services
could've done the same thing.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.436
Sure. Two caseworkers
for the entire hospital.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.814
You know as well as I do
it'd never get done in time.

19:48.897 --> 19:52.401
Between that and her wealthy,
well-connected husband showing up,

19:53.318 --> 19:55.237
I did what I had to do.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.155
You've done this before.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.950
Maybe I helped a few people along the way.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.618
I forget.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.465
So I'm okay?

20:16.091 --> 20:19.845
You might feel a little out of it,
but given your "Yes, we cannabis" T-shirt,

20:19.928 --> 20:21.722
I'm guessing that's nothing new.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.064
Are you going home to change?

20:32.566 --> 20:36.194
Some Goldman Sachs guy threw a clot
and my date is off.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.738
I am now free.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.197
So...

20:39.281 --> 20:41.783
What? I'm supposed to jump
and take you to dinner?

20:42.701 --> 20:45.078
Dude, we can skip dinner.

20:45.162 --> 20:48.749
I'm not some toy you can just jerk
off the shelf whenever you feel like it.

20:49.333 --> 20:54.171
This is where I grow some sack
and tell you I canceled our reservation.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.424
Actually, this is where I get bored
and walk away.

20:59.927 --> 21:02.971
Dude, are you high?
She doesn't want dinner.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.116
Enough is enough.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.743
I've been waiting all afternoon
to see my wife.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.913
To be honest, we're having some difficulty
locating her at the moment.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.748
Are you kidding me?
This hospital lost my wife?

21:29.831 --> 21:32.209
Actually, we're not entirely sure
she was ever here.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.505
Why don't you try Bellevue?
Maybe they have her.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.340
Tell me where the fuck she is,

21:38.423 --> 21:41.259
or I will go through every goddamn room
in this shithole until I find her,

21:41.343 --> 21:42.886
and then I'm gonna sue your ass.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.137
You seem very agitated.

21:44.221 --> 21:47.140
Maybe I should get you
some Xanax and Nembutal?

21:49.685 --> 21:52.062
She'll come back to me.
She has nowhere else to go.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.774
Appreciate it. All right, have a good one.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.211
Oh, my God. That was so inspired.

22:16.294 --> 22:19.506
It's like when the orphans saved Annie
in the laundry basket.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.054
You will never see her again.
You have my word on that.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.223
Are we done?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.100
I am. You're not.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.643
I got your text.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.356
I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.317
You know any good lawyers?

22:50.245 --> 22:52.748
You wanna tell me
where the hell you just took my patient?

22:53.373 --> 22:55.751
To a safe house for battered women.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.669
Mr. Farrell was a threat to our patient,

22:57.753 --> 23:00.547
so measures were taken
to make sure that she was...

23:00.630 --> 23:02.466
Without informing any authorities.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.886
That violates about
a dozen different statutes,

23:05.969 --> 23:07.262
putting everyone involved at risk.

23:07.637 --> 23:08.680
Pretty much.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.016
- So this was your idea, then?
-It was mine.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.227
It was mine.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.897
- It was mine.
-It was mine.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.231
It was mine.

23:19.316 --> 23:22.110
It wasn't mine. Just a temp, okay?
Had nothing to do with it.

23:26.782 --> 23:29.451
Anything like this ever happens again,

23:31.286 --> 23:32.329
come to me.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.009
We're at work.
I can't believe we're doing this.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.844
- Keep doing that.
- What?

23:48.595 --> 23:51.973
That. That is awesome.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.821
Hey, Fi, I should be home
in about half an hour.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.823
<i>Grace is in the shower.</i>

24:08.490 --> 24:11.076
Fi, where is Grace? Tell me this second.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.295
Get your bag.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.599
You sound good. I'm her mom.

24:34.683 --> 24:35.684
Mom.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.686
You're probably a very nice kid.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.605
You're 17, she is 14.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.526
This is not happening.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.709
Dinner in 20. Keep going.

25:14.931 --> 25:15.974
Hey.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.517
Hey.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.895
I was a math major in college.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.104
Yeah?

25:21.688 --> 25:22.898
Here to help.

25:24.733 --> 25:25.817
You eat?

25:26.026 --> 25:27.402
I'm starving.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.248
- Negative eight.
- Nice!

25:40.332 --> 25:41.958
Nice!

25:42.584 --> 25:44.044
This is what I'm talking about.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.504
You didn't have to do all that work.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.173
It works every time.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.428
Hey, you.
