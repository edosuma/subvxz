00:17.250 --> 00:18.917
          he's probably
     the only man in history

00:18.985 --> 00:21.920
   who's become really wealthy
   by trying to kill himself.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.523
           it's true.
   he is somewhat of a legend.

00:24.624 --> 00:27.626
   <i> he does incredible stunts</i>
       <i> with motorcycles,</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:31.330
       <i> and he has broken,</i>
      <i> i guess, more bones</i>

00:31.431 --> 00:33.966
    <i> than anybody in history,</i>
   <i> and yet he keeps at this.</i>

00:34.067 --> 00:37.036

      here is evel knievel.

     <i> i grew up in the '70s.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:47.212
        <i> and evel knievel</i>
         <i> was the '70s.</i>

00:47.313 --> 00:51.817
   he captured my imagination
        like no one else.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.385

        this film before.

00:56.322 --> 00:59.625
     knievel: <i> the motorcycle</i>
         <i> landed short,</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:01.894
     <i> ripped the handlebars</i>
        <i> out of my hands,</i>

01:01.995 --> 01:05.998

  <i> into the dunes parking lot.</i>

          carson: <i> god.</i>

01:11.805 --> 01:14.740
   <i> you're an incredible man.</i>

01:14.808 --> 01:17.076
knoxville: <i> i didn't think of him</i>
        <i> as a daredevil.</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:19.645
        <i> i thought of him</i>
        <i> as a superhero.</i>

01:19.712 --> 01:23.082
     no one ever went for it
        like that before.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.883
        he invented that.

01:24.984 --> 01:29.254
  since then, it has taken off
         in a major way.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.093
    <i> that's such a large part</i>
      <i> of our culture now.</i>

01:34.194 --> 01:36.095
     <i> he inspired all that.</i>

01:36.196 --> 01:39.765
     <i> but there'll never be</i>
         <i> another evel.</i>

01:39.833 --> 01:42.000
  i know i've been called a lot
  of things by a lot of people,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.670
  - a crazy man or a con man...
  - carson: <i> mm-hmm.</i>

01:44.737 --> 01:47.272
    ...but when you head down
      that long white line,

01:47.373 --> 01:49.274
       you better have had
    made your peace with god,

01:49.375 --> 01:50.709
       and you better know
        what you're doing

01:50.810 --> 01:52.845
        because a con man
     ain't gonna get there.

01:52.912 --> 01:57.616
          i didn't know
      the story of the man.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.787
      and it was, you know,
         pretty complex.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.724
  california judge has ordered
motorcycle stuntman evel knievel

02:05.825 --> 02:09.061

     is tough to reconcile.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.403
       it's a crazy story.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.207

       what a wheelie was

04:24.063 --> 04:25.597
 until they explained it to me.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.000
    people didn't do wheelies
      up and down the road.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.568
             i mean,
         that was crazy,

    going 80 miles per hour?

04:31.638 --> 04:33.605

04:50.523 --> 04:52.457
    i would say you're nuts.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.797
    if you're going to try to
        understand evel,

04:58.898 --> 05:01.033
        you gotta go back
        to his childhood.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.036
      his parents split up
         and left town,

05:04.103 --> 05:05.904
   and he was basically raised
      by his grandparents.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.642
bob rowling: <i> grandma and grandpa</i>
  <i> did the best they could do,</i>

05:10.743 --> 05:13.111
  and he was just rambunctious,
            i guess.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.747
      maybe he didn't have
  that attention as a young boy

05:15.815 --> 05:17.282
       when he needed it.
          ( chuckles )

05:19.018 --> 05:21.753
       truth is, i think,
  that bobby was kind of angry

05:21.821 --> 05:24.256
     with his father because
 he didn't get to stay with him.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.924
      that's what i think.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.293
        <i> he wanted to be</i>
        <i> with his father.</i>

05:30.296 --> 05:31.763

     <i> at my grandma's house,</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:33.298
          <i> and he and i</i>
     <i> were wrestling around,</i>

05:33.366 --> 05:35.567
       <i> and i punched him</i>
         <i> in the mouth.</i>

05:35.635 --> 05:38.403
     and he lit on the back
          of his head.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.006
      and i said, "bobby?"
          and nothing.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.974
     i thought, oh, my god,
          i killed him.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.411
         and instantly,
     he had these wild eyes

05:46.479 --> 05:47.913
         'cause he knew
       what had happened.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.514
     and across the kitchen,
        there was a door

05:49.615 --> 05:51.783
     that was slightly open,
        the pantry door,

05:51.851 --> 05:53.752
     and he ran at that door

05:53.820 --> 05:55.987
       and slammed it shut
         with his head.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.457
and that half-stunned him again.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.859
      and he turned around
          sitting down,

06:00.927 --> 06:03.295
      and he pointed at me,
 and he said, "did you see that?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.697
       nobody can hurt me.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.633

06:18.311 --> 06:20.379
    would be hard to handle,

           knoxville:
        <i> butte, montana,</i>

06:24.817 --> 06:28.353
      <i> was just a tough-ass</i>
          <i> mining town.</i>

06:28.454 --> 06:31.490
 when the mines were going full,
  the bars were open 24 hours.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.825
        <i> there was a lot</i>
        <i> of prostitution.</i>

     <i> drinkin' and fightin'.</i>

06:39.732 --> 06:42.334
   williams: <i> you had to learn</i>
       <i> to cope in butte.</i>

06:42.402 --> 06:45.137
     <i> sometimes coping meant</i>
        <i> with your fists.</i>

06:45.204 --> 06:46.972
           you fought.
    you stood up like a man.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.408
           you fought,
    and you were taught that.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.243
         and that's part
       of the butte credo

06:51.310 --> 06:52.878
 is you just don't back down.

          i don't know
      why he had two tires.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.868

you never knew what he was gonna
do with that motorcycle in town.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.409

       all over raising--

07:24.510 --> 07:26.211

          overtook me,

       get married there.

 he thought that he should be at
 the top of the heap, you know?

08:43.456 --> 08:47.726

 the stuff he did to make money.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.634
         linda knievel:
    <i> he made up his own job.</i>

08:55.735 --> 09:00.105
  actually, he started working
 as a security officer at night.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.706
         he had a route
   where he used to go around

09:01.807 --> 09:04.342
     at 2:00 in the morning,
       3:00 in the morning

09:04.443 --> 09:06.645
   and check all the different
         establishments.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.047
    you'd pay him to be sure
      the doors were locked

09:09.115 --> 09:11.283
         and everything,
   and if you didn't pay him,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.218
       you might be robbed
      within a month or so.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.220
     he broke into my place.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.389
  he might have got 40 or $50,
      something like that,

09:17.456 --> 09:19.057
         but not that--
          nothing big.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.993
 yeah, he was-- he ran a racket.
      no question about it.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.497
     the police called me up
           and told me

09:25.565 --> 09:29.234
     <i> that there was a known</i>
     <i> safecracker in town.</i>

09:29.302 --> 09:31.803
  <i> now i knew they were talking</i>
          <i> about evel.</i>

09:31.904 --> 09:33.038
         he was a crook.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.074
           a con-man,
     i guess you'd call him.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.877
           knoxville:
       <i> at the age of 19,</i>

09:38.945 --> 09:42.714
he starts a semi-pro hockey team
          and convinces

09:42.815 --> 09:44.516
      <i> the czechoslovakian</i>
         <i> national team</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:46.151
        <i> to come to butte</i>
         <i> to play them.</i>

09:46.218 --> 09:48.153
           <i> ( laughs )</i>
    <i> and the czechs kill 'em.</i>

09:48.220 --> 09:50.388
    like, smoke 'em 22 to 3.

09:50.489 --> 09:54.693
     <i> but i don't think evel</i>
<i>was that upset about the score.</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:56.227
           pavlovich:
        <i> i think he left</i>

09:56.295 --> 09:57.862
         <i> in the middle</i>
     <i> of the second period,</i>

09:57.930 --> 09:59.864
   and the money disappeared.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.499
     there was no more money
           to pay 'em.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.702
          so, you know,
   draw your own conclusions.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.837
     where did the money go?
           ( laughs )

10:07.373 --> 10:09.507
         williams: <i> well,</i>
       <i> butte likes people</i>

10:09.575 --> 10:12.410
     <i> who bounce up against</i>
   <i> the edges of the envelope.</i>

10:12.478 --> 10:15.947
        they're forgiving
  about some criminal activity,

10:16.048 --> 10:18.883
         but they don't
  particularly like criminals.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.052
            tonning:
 <i> he had three kids at the time.</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:24.255
       he threw all of his
    burglar bags in the river

10:24.323 --> 10:26.024
   and decided to go straight.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.695
    so knievel gets this job
        selling insurance

10:30.763 --> 10:33.064
          <i> for combined</i>
       <i> insurance company,</i>

10:33.132 --> 10:36.768
  <i> and it was run by this guy,</i>
       <i> w. clement stone,</i>

10:36.869 --> 10:38.470
    <i> who wrote a book called</i>

10:38.571 --> 10:40.905
  <i> "success through a positive</i>
       <i> mental attitude."</i>

10:41.007 --> 10:44.576
         i feel healthy.
 i feel happy. i feel terrific.

10:44.644 --> 10:49.214
         jay tamburina:
   <i> i think it really changed</i>
   <i> his thinking drastically.</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:50.915
     i mean, he was that way
         to begin with,

10:51.017 --> 10:52.651
   and it just intensified it.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.153
  he was a legendary salesman.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.755
 when he was selling insurance,
    he was selling insurance,

10:56.856 --> 10:58.556
       and he was selling
          a lot of it.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.593
  tamburina: <i> i remember he went</i>
     <i> to the mental hospital</i>

11:01.694 --> 11:03.995
           <i> in-- in--</i>
  <i> i believe it was deer lodge.</i>

11:04.063 --> 11:08.066
   <i> and he wrote 271 policies</i>

11:08.134 --> 11:10.402
        in this hospital,
        mental hospital.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.604
    <i> this was a super record,</i>
    <i> nobody had ever written</i>

11:12.705 --> 11:14.773
       <i> that many policies</i>
        <i> in a week ever.</i>

11:14.874 --> 11:17.175
 <i> and he talked to the president</i>
  <i> of the company at that time</i>

11:17.243 --> 11:20.011
      and said, "i'll break
  every record in the company,

11:20.112 --> 11:21.780
        "every single one
          that exists,

11:21.881 --> 11:24.282
and you make me a vice president
        after i do that."

11:24.350 --> 11:27.185
   and mr. stawn says, "sorry,
    that isn't gonna happen."

11:27.253 --> 11:29.587
              well,
    knievel didn't like that.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.090
           knoxville:
   <i> so he picks up his family</i>

11:32.158 --> 11:34.993
           <i> and moves</i>
   <i> to moses lake, washington,</i>

11:35.061 --> 11:37.862
      <i> where he gets a job</i>
   <i> selling honda motorcycles.</i>

11:37.963 --> 11:39.464
       gunn: <i> he was making</i>
      <i> a good living at it,</i>

11:39.532 --> 11:41.599
         <i> but it wasn't</i>
      <i> good enough for him.</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:45.437
    he says, "i think i need
     to do something weird,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.540
      "some kind of a stunt
       so it'll get people

11:48.607 --> 11:51.309
        to come down here
    and see the motorcycles."

11:51.410 --> 11:54.612
    so he had this crazy idea
     about doing this jump.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.683
  he says, "i'm gonna jump over
    cougars and rattlesnakes"

11:58.784 --> 12:01.286
             i said,
   "you gotta be kidding me."

12:01.353 --> 12:04.155
        gunn: <i> my part in</i>
    <i> that mountain lion jump</i>

12:04.256 --> 12:07.559
    <i> was i wore a white coat</i>
         <i> like a doctor,</i>

12:07.626 --> 12:10.028
     and evel introduced me
      as the veterinarian,

12:10.096 --> 12:13.064
   which was a crock of bull,
             but...

12:13.165 --> 12:16.501
      so he brings 'em down
 and put the cougars underneath.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.403
  and they're scared to death.
      they won't come out.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.972
   they were like kitty cats.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.841
         but the snakes,
            holy -- !

12:22.908 --> 12:25.210
          <i> we put them</i>
 <i> in a big refrigerator carton,</i>

12:25.277 --> 12:27.879
   <i> and they were pissed off.</i>

12:27.980 --> 12:30.081
  <i> so he goes around the track,</i>
 <i> and then he goes up the ramp.</i>

12:30.182 --> 12:31.916
     <i> and, well, the minute</i>
     <i> he went up in the air</i>

12:31.984 --> 12:33.351
          <i> i could see</i>
    <i> he wasn't gonna make it.</i>

12:33.452 --> 12:35.520
      by god, he was about
        three feet short.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.355
       his back tire hits
    the refrigerator carton.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.257
         and the snakes
   go flipping into the crowd.

12:39.358 --> 12:42.227
   <i> talk about people running</i>
   <i> and getting out of there.</i>

12:42.328 --> 12:44.729
              <i> -- !</i>
           <i> ( laughs )</i>

12:44.830 --> 12:48.500
 the poor guy from vantage wants
  us to help catch his snakes!

12:48.567 --> 12:51.936
( laughs ) i said, "you gotta be
          kidding me!"

12:52.004 --> 12:54.539
      and he just rode back
       on his motorcycle,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.775
        went up the jump,
     and waved at the crowd.

12:56.842 --> 13:00.211
he didn't-- he didn't care about
           the snakes.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.046
 people started talking to him,
        you know, "what--

13:02.114 --> 13:04.048
            you know,
     what can you do next?"

13:04.116 --> 13:06.551
  and he started thinking about
       that kind of stuff.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.586
     that's when he come up
          with the idea

13:08.654 --> 13:10.255
    of starting a stunt show.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.291
       i told him, i said,
 "they're gonna eat you up, boy.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.559
     you'll never make it."

13:19.999 --> 13:22.367
           tim perior:
       <i> i was a bartender</i>
         <i> at marty's bar</i>

13:22.468 --> 13:25.603
     <i> in orange, california,</i>
    <i> and this fella comes in,</i>

13:25.671 --> 13:29.641
  <i> sits at the end of the bar,</i>
     <i> and we start talking.</i>

13:29.742 --> 13:33.545
              well,
  he's a motorcycle daredevil,

13:33.646 --> 13:36.147
           and he had
      jumped rattlesnakes,

13:36.215 --> 13:40.819
    and he wants to do a big
       ramp-to-ramp jump.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.987
            he said,
     "people will go wild,"

13:43.088 --> 13:45.123
    and he just convinced me.

13:49.395 --> 13:53.231
       <i> somehow i was able</i>
      <i> to get two pickups,</i>

13:53.299 --> 13:56.634
           <i> a tractor,</i>
      <i> and 40-foot trailer.</i>

13:56.735 --> 14:00.405
      <i> the logo on the side</i>
       <i> was "evel knievel</i>

14:00.472 --> 14:02.140
       <i> and his motorcycle</i>
          <i> daredevils."</i>

14:04.577 --> 14:08.580
    <i> well, the name evel came</i>
 <i> from his wild years in butte.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:10.615
     he was given that name
          by the cops.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.284
         he was in jail
   with a guy named "knawful."

14:13.385 --> 14:15.086
      and they said, "well,

14:15.187 --> 14:17.522
    better lock up the doors
      pretty good tonight.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.959
     we got an awful knawful
   and evil knievel in here."

14:23.462 --> 14:25.263
   blackenship: <i> he heard that,</i>
       <i> and he liked that.</i>

14:25.331 --> 14:27.365
             perior:
    <i> he changed it to e-v-e-l</i>

14:27.466 --> 14:29.868
        because he didn't
     want to sound too evil.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.341
   what he did is get a bunch
   of people working with him.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.344
   good guys like sweet savage
        and eddie mulder

14:39.411 --> 14:41.112
        <i> and klesh fargo.</i>

14:41.213 --> 14:43.548
              gunn:
   <i> so he started thinking up</i>

14:43.649 --> 14:45.683
    <i> different stunts to do.</i>

14:45.784 --> 14:47.485
             perior:
      <i> the flaming boards,</i>

14:47.586 --> 14:51.289
    we'd soak 'em in gasoline
      and light it on fire.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.792
   leeuwen: <i> and he'd hit that</i>
 <i> first board and just go boom!</i>

14:54.860 --> 14:57.228
         and the sparks,
 the stuff would fly in the air!

14:57.329 --> 14:59.163
        <i> and then, boom!</i>
      <i> hit the second one!</i>

14:59.231 --> 15:00.732
       <i> sparks would fly!</i>
 <i> and, boom, hit the third one!</i>

15:00.799 --> 15:03.735
      <i> hit the fourth one,</i>
      <i> and the fifth one...</i>

15:03.802 --> 15:09.140
  somehow, bob got this midget
     called butch willhelm,

15:09.241 --> 15:11.910
         <i> and talked him</i>
     <i> into joining the show.</i>

15:11.977 --> 15:16.247
      bob said, "he will do
 everything i do in miniature."

15:16.348 --> 15:19.784
       <i> and he would crash</i>
      <i> on every single one.</i>

15:21.687 --> 15:24.022
 so then it looked like when bob
   was going to make his jump,

15:24.123 --> 15:25.890
       something terrible
       is going to happen.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.662
           he was such
     a crazy son of a bitch.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.264
     <i> he'd do these stunts,</i>
 <i> and he never tried 'em before.</i>

15:33.332 --> 15:36.100
  one time he had a motorcycle
           run at him

15:36.168 --> 15:38.937
     about 60 miles an hour,
        and he jumped up,

15:39.038 --> 15:40.939
       <i> but he didn't jump</i>
          <i> high enough.</i>

15:41.040 --> 15:44.709
   perior: <i> and the motorcycle</i>
 <i> hit him and flipped him over.</i>

15:48.080 --> 15:50.882
         he was sprained
  from his waist to his ankles.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.584
      man: <i> i think at that</i>
    <i> point is when he decided</i>

15:53.686 --> 15:55.720
    <i> he was just gonna stick</i>
  <i> to jumping the motorcycles.</i>

16:09.335 --> 16:11.302
         robbie knievel:
<i>the equipment my dad jumped on,</i>

16:11.370 --> 16:14.105
       compared to what's
        going on today--

16:14.173 --> 16:15.640
          unbelievable.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.042
            leeuwen:
 <i> the thing weighed 500 pounds.</i>

16:18.143 --> 16:21.479
   it'd be like jumping a dump
   truck over all those cars,

16:21.547 --> 16:22.981
     but he'd do it anyway.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.816
      i was the speedometer
            for evel.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.051
        i had stand there
      and watch him and say

16:27.152 --> 16:29.821
    you're going fast enough
or you're not going fast enough.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.291
      i guess you'd call it
           guesswork.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.627
   perior: <i> bob jumped further</i>
  <i> and further with each show.</i>

16:36.729 --> 16:40.732
        the only thing is
   those stands were not full.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.467
        not by any means.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.570
   <i> how do you convince people</i>
       <i> to come to a sport</i>

16:45.637 --> 16:47.271
    <i> they had never heard of?</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:52.343
    <i> we were $52,000 in debt.</i>

16:52.444 --> 16:55.146
     bob kept spending money
         we didn't have.

16:55.247 --> 16:59.250
    and that's when i decided
         i had to leave.

  before we get back to racing,
  i'd like to introduce to you

18:27.139 --> 18:29.040
    a most unusual young man.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.343
this is evel knievel,
and his specialty in sports

18:32.411 --> 18:35.046
is to take a motorcycle
up over a ramp

18:35.147 --> 18:37.048
    <i> and leap through the air</i>
         <i> some 90 feet.</i>

18:37.149 --> 18:39.217
 <i> that's what he's gonna try to</i>
 <i> do today over 15 automobiles.</i>

18:39.318 --> 18:41.219
 - you're trying 15 today?
 - well, the parachute's ready.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.387
              motorcycle's ready
              and i'm ready.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.789
               and i'm not
               gonna miss today.

18:44.857 --> 18:48.092
            reporter:
      <i> and he's set to go.</i>

18:57.569 --> 19:00.872
        <i> a beautiful leap</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:04.108
     <i> gets the roar approval</i>

19:04.209 --> 19:06.277
    leeuwen: <i> here here we are</i>
   <i> at "wide world of sports."</i>

19:06.345 --> 19:07.578
    biggest race of the year.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.380
     biggest dirt track race
          of the year.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.716
          and i won it.
         i won the race.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.952
     and you think anybody'd
        remember it? no.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.888
       they know knievel.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.524
      they remember knievel
 out of that whole deal, not me.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.626
       and i won 100 laps.
        road my ass off.

19:25.164 --> 19:25.796
      so e

19:25.864 --> 19:27.298
so evel got his foot
          in the door,

19:27.399 --> 19:33.604
       and now he's going
        to knock it down.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.275
 if you was to think of the most
 outrageous thing you could do,

19:37.342 --> 19:39.644
        what would it be?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.946
  <i> it'd be jump those fountains</i>
      <i> at caesar's palace.</i>

19:43.882 --> 19:45.583
      robbie: i don't know
       where it came from,

19:45.684 --> 19:48.653
     how a guy would go down
     caesar's palace strip,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.956
    <i> look at the fountains--</i>
     <i> what was he thinking?</i>

19:52.057 --> 19:54.158
   <i> where did that come from?</i>

19:54.259 --> 19:56.093
    knoxville: <i> so evel wants</i>
   <i> to do this stunt in vegas,</i>

19:56.161 --> 19:58.429
        <i> but no one knows</i>
      <i> who the hell he is.</i>

19:58.530 --> 20:00.665
         so he switches
       into hustler mode.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.834
     kelly: <i> this guy called</i>
       <i> every news outlet,</i>

20:03.902 --> 20:07.772
  <i> told them that evel knievel,</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:10.107

20:12.611 --> 20:14.812

20:14.913 --> 20:16.514
   <i> the guy who runs caesars,</i>

20:16.615 --> 20:18.849
  <i> and each time he would call</i>
     <i> as a different person,</i>

20:18.917 --> 20:22.019
     and each time, he would
   mispronounce his own name.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.321
    evel knievel: <i> i told him</i>
      <i> my name was larson.</i>

20:23.422 --> 20:24.889
 <i> i was with</i> sports illustrated.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.624

        <i> 'evel neevel'?"</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:31.028
   <i> so i waited two more days</i>
   <i> and i called him back up,</i>

20:31.096 --> 20:32.964
          <i> and i said,</i>
   <i> "this is dennis lewin from</i>

    <i> who is this crazy guy?"</i>

20:36.802 --> 20:39.003
            <i> he said,</i>
   <i> "everybody's calling me up</i>
           <i> about him.</i>

20:39.104 --> 20:41.906
        <i> he said, i think</i>
    <i> we got a deal with him.</i>

20:42.007 --> 20:43.074
          <i> ( laughter )</i>

20:45.744 --> 20:47.211
           knoxville:
   <i> like a lot of his stunts,</i>

20:47.279 --> 20:49.080
        <i> caesar's palace</i>
        <i> was one of those</i>

20:49.181 --> 20:50.648

      <i> before he even knew</i>
        <i> it was possible.</i>

20:52.985 --> 20:55.186
      <i> and then on the day,</i>
   <i> he's got the crowds there,</i>

20:55.287 --> 20:57.622
      <i> and he doesn't know</i>
       <i> if he can make it.</i>

20:57.723 --> 20:58.990
  <i> he's just got to go for it.</i>

21:01.627 --> 21:03.928
       robin knievel-dick:
 <i> i talked with him for a while</i>
       <i> before he jumped,</i>

21:03.996 --> 21:07.632
    and he was very unsettled
         about the jump.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.467
 <i> you could tell he was nervous.</i>

21:14.172 --> 21:16.507
       <i> he was making runs</i>
        <i> at the ramp and,</i>

21:16.575 --> 21:18.709
           <i> you know,</i>
 <i> we could hear the motorcycle.</i>

21:18.810 --> 21:20.211
  <i> and we could hear the crowd,</i>

21:20.279 --> 21:22.179
     and then the doorman--

21:22.281 --> 21:25.182
  the doorman got on the phone
    and told us what went on.

21:30.088 --> 21:31.822
       <i> ( woman screams )</i>

21:36.194 --> 21:40.398
        tonning: <i> my god.</i>
       <i> that was horrible.</i>

21:40.465 --> 21:42.166
    <i> i thought he was gonna--</i>
     <i> i thought he was dead.</i>

21:42.267 --> 21:45.936
    i was horrified to watch
 my friend look like a rag doll.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.903
  linda knievel: <i> i don't think</i>
      <i> he was unconscious.</i>

22:19.004 --> 22:21.472
      <i> but he was hurting.</i>

22:21.573 --> 22:24.442
     <i> so off to the hospital</i>
            <i> we went.</i>

22:24.509 --> 22:26.644
           knoxville:
     <i> he had a broken wrist,</i>

22:26.745 --> 22:29.814
       <i> two broken ankles,</i>
      <i> crushed his pelvis.</i>

22:29.915 --> 22:32.183
       <i> and then somehow,</i>

22:32.284 --> 22:34.285
         <i> word gets out</i>
      <i> that he's in a coma</i>

22:34.386 --> 22:36.187
     <i> and might not make it.</i>

22:36.288 --> 22:40.658
       he told that story,
    but he wasn't in a coma.

22:40.759 --> 22:42.426
            in fact,
       i flew down there,

22:42.494 --> 22:44.795
       and it hadn't been
        but like two days

22:44.863 --> 22:46.464
    since he'd had the wreck,
        and he was awake

22:46.565 --> 22:48.366
          when i walked
      in the hospital room.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.000
           ( laughs )

22:50.068 --> 22:52.603
 he had the press come in there
         and play it up.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.805
     "oh, i'm about to die.
  don't know if i'll make it."

22:54.873 --> 22:56.107
     well, this was knievel.
       that's what he did.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.508
         he played it up
        right to the end.

22:59.611 --> 23:02.546
           knoxville:
 <i> pretty soon, the crash footage</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:12.523
    all of the agony of that
      and the broken bones.

   to see him go over and over

23:16.595 --> 23:19.997

26:18.843 --> 26:21.178
       -<i> do you have fear?</i>
       - i am not scared.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.814
    when i go off that jump,
 i will say i have some concern,

26:23.882 --> 26:25.716

26:31.323 --> 26:33.924
  i relax when i hit

   and being scared.

  <i> and just to go up that ramp</i>

26:55.146 --> 26:58.382

  <i> that he's got to, in effect,</i>

26:58.483 --> 27:01.585
         <i> hurdle aboard</i>
  <i> his harley davidson machine.</i>

    <i> when he left that ramp,</i>

27:05.156 --> 27:07.758
         something awful
       was going to happen

27:07.859 --> 27:11.528
 between the time he left there
  and came down way over here.

27:11.596 --> 27:14.331
   if he told ya he was gonna
  do something, he would do it,

27:14.432 --> 27:16.900
     i mean, even if he knew
     it was gonna kill him.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.986
        linda: <i> you know,</i>
       <i> you were always--</i>

27:36.087 --> 27:39.556
 <i> the question of whether or not</i>
  <i> he might not make it alive.</i>

27:39.624 --> 27:43.427
 i would think my dad would die
      every time he jumped.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.829
        it was stressful.
       it was hard on us.

27:45.897 --> 27:49.266
    pavlovich: <i> if he crashed,</i>
    <i> you know, and got hurt,</i>

27:49.367 --> 27:51.969
        then he'd go out,
     he's gonna do it again.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.905
  and everybody says he's nuts.
   he got hurt the last time.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.008
     evel knievel: <i> doctors,</i>
      <i> especially surgeons,</i>

27:58.076 --> 28:01.612
        have been amazed
    at how i can keep going.

28:01.713 --> 28:05.416
            he had...
       recuperative powers

28:05.517 --> 28:08.285
        that were beyond
         normal people.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.853

28:14.359 --> 28:16.794
     man: <i> this may look like</i>
  <i> just some abstract plumbing,</i>

28:16.895 --> 28:18.996
      <i> but this is actually</i>
         <i> the right hip</i>

28:19.097 --> 28:21.665

   evel knievel: <i> i think i've</i>
<i>probably become immune to pain.</i>

28:24.369 --> 28:29.006
 i've learned to live with pain
  for so long that i think, uh,

28:29.107 --> 28:31.675
   what would hurt an average
 person doesn't hurt me so much.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.310

    <i> when we were growing up</i>

28:33.378 --> 28:35.345
    <i> and my dad broke bones,</i>
      <i> and he was in pain,</i>

28:35.447 --> 28:36.947
   <i> he never bitched about it.</i>

28:37.015 --> 28:38.782
 <i> he never complained about it.</i>

28:38.883 --> 28:41.185
   no, no, i'll be all right.
    i'm gonna jump some more.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.354
  <i> it was just he accepted that</i>
<i>that's what he had chosen to do</i>

28:44.456 --> 28:46.023
       and it's something
    he just had to deal with,

28:46.091 --> 28:47.624
       and that's the way
        he dealt with it.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.364
         to be something
     a little extra special,

28:54.466 --> 28:56.366
   no matter what i want to do
       if i like to do it.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.802
        to be a champion
       or to be the best.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.938
   even though i've been hurt
         so many times,

29:01.005 --> 29:03.741
and live like a lot of people do
        that live in a...

29:05.844 --> 29:08.512
     a gray twilight world--

29:08.580 --> 29:10.581
      these kind of people,
  they don't even know victory

29:10.648 --> 29:12.583
    or defeat because they've
      never tried anything,

29:12.650 --> 29:15.786
      and this is something
  that i feel compelled to do,

29:15.854 --> 29:17.354
    and i am going to do it.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.862
i had
   <i> sort of been brought along</i>
    <i> the way of a teen idol.</i>

29:24.963 --> 29:26.263
                   mm-mmm.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.266
          <i> i had enough</i>
       <i> star power going,</i>

29:29.334 --> 29:31.168
       <i> but i kept trying</i>
     <i> to toughen up my act.</i>

29:31.236 --> 29:32.836
         i thought, god,
         if i could get

29:32.937 --> 29:35.105
      a really good western
  or i get good action movie...

29:35.206 --> 29:38.509
  and i was looking for sort of
 a modern day western character.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.511
       who would that be?

29:40.612 --> 29:44.615
 <i> i remember seeing the footage</i>
     <i> from caesar's palace,</i>

29:44.716 --> 29:46.750
         and i thought,
     yeah, that's the movie.

29:46.851 --> 29:50.387
 <i> in my mind there was only one</i>
 <i> guy that could do this right.</i>

29:50.488 --> 29:52.523
          <i> john milius,</i>
  <i> he'd written "dirty harry,"</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:54.525
      <i> "jeremiah johnson,"</i>

29:54.626 --> 29:57.361
      <i> and of course later</i>
       <i> "apocalypse now."</i>

29:57.428 --> 30:00.564
 milius just wrote it as though
  he was writing it for patton.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.300
       it had this sort of
  mythic sound to it, you know?

30:03.401 --> 30:06.537
      and it's got this man
  who thinks he's a gladiator.

30:06.604 --> 30:09.706
        and i was excited
       to show evel this.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.442
         <i> so he tells me</i>
 <i> to come meet him in hollywood</i>

30:12.544 --> 30:16.280
      <i> at the saharan hotel</i>
     <i> that was up on sunset.</i>

30:16.347 --> 30:18.115
     he's been up all night.

30:18.183 --> 30:21.251
     got another huge wound.
      kotex pads all there.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.821
      and he's lying there
   like a posh in a bad motel.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.557
     and that's when it all
           got crazy.

30:26.624 --> 30:28.759
        he took a bottle
       of the wild turkey,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.460
      and i heard the snap
         of the turkey,

30:30.528 --> 30:32.629
  and he drank half that thing
     down and he'd sit down.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.499
 i said, "well, i wanna tell you
 that we've got a great script,

30:35.600 --> 30:37.000
  and i just brought it to you,
   and i want you to read it."

30:37.101 --> 30:38.569
     he said, "you read it,"
           and i said,

30:38.636 --> 30:40.604
     "well, i have read it,
      and i really love it.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.005
      i think it's great."

30:42.073 --> 30:43.974
    he said, "no, i want you
       to read it to me."

30:44.075 --> 30:46.243
    and i just i didn't want
       to read the script.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.644
             i mean,
       it was just crazy,

30:47.712 --> 30:49.279
     the idea of me reading
       the script to him.

30:49.380 --> 30:52.182
    but he was dead serious,
       and i saw this gun.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.651
 and he put it right to my head.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.653
         and i thought,
         he means this.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.823
            you know,
   this is really real stuff.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.492
         my performance
     on reading that script

31:02.560 --> 31:04.761
          was the best
        i've ever given,

31:04.829 --> 31:07.931
   and i probably should have
    gotten an academy award.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.533
      ladies and gentlemen,
        you have no idea

31:09.634 --> 31:12.769
    how good it makes me feel
        to be here today.

31:12.837 --> 31:15.606
      it is truly an honor
   to risk my life before you.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.641
            an honor.

31:17.742 --> 31:21.044
   before i jump my motorcycle
      over these 19 cars--

31:21.112 --> 31:22.846
     and i want you to note,
    there's not a volkswagen

31:22.914 --> 31:24.681
     or a datsun in the row.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.850
       <i> ( motor revving )</i>

31:26.918 --> 31:29.786

 <i> evel was not happy with it,</i>
       <i> i don't believe,</i>

31:29.854 --> 31:32.289
     from what i understand
         talking to him.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.891
         i don't believe
       he was at all happy

31:33.992 --> 31:36.193
  with george hamilton in that.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.395
  hamilton: <i> i don't think evel</i>
         <i> appreciated me</i>

31:38.463 --> 31:41.498
   <i> climbing into his leathers</i>
 <i> and getting on his motorcycle,</i>

31:41.566 --> 31:44.301
      but what happened is,
           by osmosis,

31:44.402 --> 31:46.370
     when he went to see it
         in the theater,

31:46.471 --> 31:48.705
       <i> when he came out,</i>
  <i> he was saying these things,</i>

31:48.806 --> 31:50.641
         <i> and they were</i>
      <i> extraordinary words</i>

31:50.742 --> 31:52.542
     coming out of his mouth
 that john had written for him.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.378
   they told the wright brothers
   to fly was impossible,

31:54.479 --> 31:55.812
          and they probably told
          neil armstrong

31:55.914 --> 31:57.981
            the walk on the moon
            was impossible.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.651
          they said that shepard
           and glenn would never
           get around the world,

32:00.752 --> 32:02.819
    and they said that armstrong
    wouldn't step on the moon.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.456
     you know, he was using
        a writer's words.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.192
      and this is the evel
          he's become.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.833
          i'm all alone
    when i jump those ramps.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.169
     there's only two things
    that keep the rest of 'em
         from doing it,

32:19.237 --> 32:21.204
         and that's fear
 and the big hole in the middle,

32:21.306 --> 32:24.675
      and as long as i can
   stand alone and be the best

32:24.776 --> 32:27.044
      <i> at what i am doing,</i>
  <i> i'm gonna continue to do it.</i>

32:29.480 --> 32:32.416

32:32.483 --> 32:34.885
         <i> and then tried</i>
       <i> to live the part.</i>

32:34.953 --> 32:37.854
    he never broke character.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.124
     he had the evel knievel
            persona,

32:41.225 --> 32:44.761
  <i> and that's what he presented</i>

         <i> the good guy.</i>

32:57.875 --> 32:59.109
  if i look like i'm rigging up
  for a trip into outer space,

32:59.210 --> 33:00.744
          you're right.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.214
     nobody should ever ride
 a motorcycle without a helmet.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.249
           i never do.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.719

    who was seeking what many
    of us do in our own way,

33:12.757 --> 33:14.291
     and that's recognition,

33:14.392 --> 33:16.660
         <i> and if you get</i>
      <i> into his background,</i>

  <i> was one of their main areas.</i>

40:50.414 --> 40:51.748
     sullivan: <i> the announcer</i>

40:53.884 --> 40:55.452

       this jump tonight,

        back 100 years."

40:59.790 --> 41:01.324
       wrong thing to say.

41:06.397 --> 41:09.199
   <i> he barely made that jump,</i>
       <i> came back around,</i>

41:09.266 --> 41:11.935

        of hell's angels

41:12.036 --> 41:14.103
  had come out onto the floor.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.172
      and this hell's angel
          grabbed him.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.274
           well, i'm--
         i'm hoofing it.

41:18.342 --> 41:22.045
<i>the hell's angel threw him down</i>
     <i> just when i got there,</i>

         just went out.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.985
   well, then the war started,

       <i> hell's angels come</i>
     <i> bowling in over there</i>

41:34.325 --> 41:35.925
    <i> and the people come out</i>
         <i> of the stands</i>

41:35.993 --> 41:37.327
  <i> and started beating on 'em.</i>

41:39.430 --> 41:42.165
     <i> they put two of those</i>
 <i> hell's angels in the hospital.</i>

41:48.272 --> 41:50.773

42:26.911 --> 42:28.545

42:43.527 --> 42:45.361

i'm not supposed to be afraid.

     he can through alcohol,

42:59.376 --> 43:03.246
    through being flamboyant,
    through, being, you know,

43:03.314 --> 43:06.916
    crude or whatever to get
 these thoughts out of his head,

43:07.017 --> 43:08.551

43:08.652 --> 43:10.386
    you know, evel,
    you're shaking a little bit.

43:10.487 --> 43:13.456
well, if you did what i did,
you'd be shaking, too.

43:13.557 --> 43:17.994
   i could see it in his eyes
sometimes when he'd come back by

43:18.095 --> 43:19.829

          fast enough,

43:19.897 --> 43:22.231

     <i> i knew he was scared,</i>
      <i> but he would never--</i>

43:26.570 --> 43:28.571

43:28.672 --> 43:30.006
           <i> you know,</i>
    <i> he'd go ahead and do it.</i>

43:32.042 --> 43:34.944
the medicine that he was taking,
     the drugs he was taking

43:35.045 --> 43:37.447

     plus he was drinking--

43:37.548 --> 43:40.650
   <i> he became just schitzo...</i>

43:40.751 --> 43:42.452
       <i> i mean, paranoid.</i>

43:42.553 --> 43:45.588

  <i> about protecting his stuff,</i>

43:45.689 --> 43:47.790

43:47.858 --> 43:50.293
   williams: <i> we'd be talking,</i>
        <i> and almost as if</i>

43:52.029 --> 43:54.664
           <i> he'd flip</i>
 <i> and become ugly about things.</i>

43:54.765 --> 43:58.301
  i had to stand two guys down
   who wanted a piece of him,

43:58.402 --> 43:59.702
 and they wanted a piece of him

43:59.770 --> 44:01.471
  because he was being an -- .

44:01.572 --> 44:03.373
      he was being a jerk.

44:03.474 --> 44:07.010
 i'm the guy who just, you know,
  is trying to keep the peace.

44:07.111 --> 44:11.180
           i'm the guy
   protecting the troublemaker

44:11.248 --> 44:13.249
       from the good guys.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.852
    you know, and i thought,
        i can't do this.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.324
      hamilton: <i> it's really</i>
     <i> interesting when you--</i>

         <i> you are a man</i>
       <i> like evel knievel,</i>

44:24.128 --> 44:27.397
 <i> and you've created this myth,</i>
    <i> and once you're defined,</i>

44:27.498 --> 44:30.533
   it's hard to live up to it.

44:30.601 --> 44:33.670
     he was always reselling
    what he had already sold.

44:33.771 --> 44:35.505
         how do you get
      any better than that?

44:35.606 --> 44:36.673
   how do you get any bigger?

44:38.609 --> 44:40.410
            williams:
      <i> throughout his life,</i>

44:40.511 --> 44:43.212
       <i> he was insatiable.</i>

44:43.313 --> 44:46.249
        <i> even when he was</i>
   <i> the most famous daredevil</i>

44:46.350 --> 44:49.819
        <i> that ever lived,</i>
      <i> he wasn't satisfied.</i>

44:49.887 --> 44:53.690
  <i> he had to make another half</i>
  <i> a million dollars on a jump.</i>

44:53.791 --> 44:57.727
  he had to find one more woman
     prettier than the last.

44:57.795 --> 45:02.065
  <i> he couldn't satisfy himself.</i>
  <i> he had to do something else.</i>

45:02.166 --> 45:05.234
   he had a friend that, uh--
  they were at the bar talking,

45:05.335 --> 45:08.271
         and this fella
      just made a comment,

45:08.338 --> 45:09.572
    "what's your next thing?"

45:09.673 --> 45:11.841
        i think he said,
       "the grand canyon?"

45:11.909 --> 45:14.711
  well, of course that started
        wheels a-turnin'.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.785
      kelly knievel: <i> one of</i>
<i>the favorite pictures of my dad</i>

45:22.886 --> 45:25.555
      <i> is he is on the rim</i>
      <i> of the grand canyon</i>

45:25.622 --> 45:27.890
       <i> and there's these</i>
    <i> two navajo chiefs there.</i>

45:27.991 --> 45:29.392
     <i> and my dad's pointing</i>

45:29.460 --> 45:32.095
        at the other side
      of the grand canyon,

45:32.162 --> 45:35.064
 and they're just looking at him
     like this man is crazy.

45:35.165 --> 45:38.267
     evel knievel: <i> my dream</i>
 <i> was to jump the grand canyon.</i>

45:38.368 --> 45:40.236
    the secretary of interior
      told me that i could.

45:40.337 --> 45:43.906
     i took his word for it.
    then he changed his mind.

45:44.007 --> 45:48.444
 so i told him to go get hosed,
   and i bought my own canyon,

45:48.545 --> 45:51.814
     <i> the snake river canyon</i>
     <i> in the state of idaho.</i>

45:51.915 --> 45:53.983
    and the only way they'll
      get me out of the air

45:54.084 --> 45:56.219
       is to shoot me out
   with an anti-aircraft gun,

45:56.286 --> 45:58.654
     because i am gonna go,
           believe me.

45:58.722 --> 46:02.725
   <i> the jump across the canyon</i>
 <i> will be approximately a mile.</i>

46:02.826 --> 46:05.628
  <i> it's somewhere between 1,000</i>
  <i> and 1500 feet to the bottom.</i>

46:05.729 --> 46:07.263
      as you can see, pete,
         this motorcycle

46:07.364 --> 46:09.332
    is unlike any motorcycle
 you've ever seen in the world.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.769
   these rockets put out about
   90 pounds of thrust apiece.

46:12.836 --> 46:15.438
   knievel's original concept
     was take a motorcycle,

46:15.539 --> 46:16.906
      put a rocket on it--

46:17.007 --> 46:19.442
     <i> and that's impossible.</i>

46:19.543 --> 46:21.944
      and so the necessity
          just required

46:22.012 --> 46:24.447
 that he make a rocket vehicle.

46:24.548 --> 46:27.083
  <i> our partner was bob treaux,</i>

46:27.184 --> 46:30.153
      <i> and he was known as</i>
 <i> the father of steam rocketry.</i>

46:30.254 --> 46:31.854
    <i> and that was our answer</i>

46:31.922 --> 46:35.358
    <i> for getting evel knievel</i>
       <i> over the canyon--</i>

46:35.459 --> 46:37.994
       basically building
        a hot-water tank

46:38.095 --> 46:40.296
        and uncorking it
         and let it go.

46:40.397 --> 46:42.298
            this machine
            is powered by steam.

46:42.399 --> 46:43.599
        steam is the most
        reliable source of power

46:43.667 --> 46:45.168
           we have in the world.

46:45.269 --> 46:48.271
          and it'll go from zero
          to 350 miles an hour

46:48.372 --> 46:50.506
          from a dead stop
          in eight seconds flat.

           ( laughs )

49:08.979 --> 49:11.047
  rivera: <i> he was a hero of mine</i>
         <i> in many ways.</i>

49:11.114 --> 49:14.183
     <i> i was a little crazy.</i>
   <i> he was a whole lot crazy.</i>

49:14.284 --> 49:17.219
          and you just
     had to dig his courage.

49:17.287 --> 49:20.256
    it just didn't seem to me
  that courage would be enough.

49:20.357 --> 49:22.858
  ( chuckles ) i'm tellin' ya,

49:22.926 --> 49:26.262
  that looks a lot further than
  i thought a mile would look.

49:26.363 --> 49:29.899
    <i> it was the kind of stunt</i>
 <i> where you would actually see,</i>

49:30.000 --> 49:33.035
            probably,
       a guy kill himself.

49:33.103 --> 49:35.838
      it was so audacious.
        it was so daring.

49:35.939 --> 49:38.274
   it was so almost impossible
          in many ways

49:38.375 --> 49:40.176
     but for his confidence.

49:40.277 --> 49:42.111
what about the g-forces?

49:42.212 --> 49:44.413
i mean, when you start something
that's gonna be going

49:44.481 --> 49:46.882
350 miles an hour,
aren't you gonna be
knocked out almost?

49:46.950 --> 49:48.884
              yes, i'll wake up,

49:48.952 --> 49:50.753
      see the other side of
      the ground way over there,

49:50.854 --> 49:53.222
       wherever the hell i'm at,
       and i'll pull a rip cord

49:53.290 --> 49:55.591
          and open a parachute
          behind that sky cycle.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.927
are you saying that
you're gonna be unconscious
when you're up in the air?

49:58.028 --> 49:59.929
        to 2,000 feet,
        i probably will be, yes.

50:00.030 --> 50:01.630
<i>so that means you</i>
<i>have to regain</i>
<i>your consciousness.</i>

50:01.732 --> 50:04.033
              that's right,
              but i can do that.
              i'll do it.

50:04.134 --> 50:05.534
         doug malewicki:
     <i> evel had no training.</i>

50:05.635 --> 50:07.303
       he had no training
         for pulling gs

50:07.404 --> 50:09.905
        like a centrifuge
     or even in an airplane,

50:09.973 --> 50:12.041
   zero parachute experience.

50:12.109 --> 50:15.111
          sprow: <i> he had</i>
   <i> a dead stick kind of thing</i>

50:15.212 --> 50:18.581
  <i> where it was spring-loaded,</i>
      <i> and if he passed out</i>

50:18.682 --> 50:20.983
    and let go of the handle,
  the parachute would come out.

50:21.051 --> 50:21.951
                          go!

50:24.855 --> 50:26.389
   rivera: <i> there were actually</i>
   <i> three of the steam-powered</i>

50:26.490 --> 50:28.257
       <i> sky cycles built.</i>
         <i> the original,</i>

50:28.325 --> 50:30.726
         <i> called the x1,</i>
   <i> was tested without a pilot</i>

50:30.827 --> 50:32.661
     <i> about three weeks ago.</i>

50:32.763 --> 50:35.131
          <i> it ended up</i>
  <i> at the bottom of the canyon.</i>

50:42.105 --> 50:44.640
          evel knievel:
     <i> that was a test shot.</i>
     <i> we made some mistakes.</i>

50:44.741 --> 50:46.108
         if i'd have been in it,
         i'd have ended up dead,

50:46.209 --> 50:47.443
            but i don't think
            that's gonna happen.

50:47.511 --> 50:50.513
             campoy:
  <i> what the press did not know</i>

50:50.580 --> 50:54.150
     <i> is that the first one</i>
     <i> was designed to fail.</i>

50:54.217 --> 50:56.152
        <i> we purposefully</i>
    <i> underpowered the rocket</i>

50:56.219 --> 50:58.521
     <i> so it wouldn't make it</i>
       <i> to the other side.</i>

50:58.588 --> 51:00.189
          he wanted it
     as a promotional thing.

51:00.290 --> 51:02.124
      he wanted it to crash
          in the water

51:02.225 --> 51:03.959
    and let people see that.

51:04.061 --> 51:07.263
       campoy: <i> eventually,</i>
      <i> we did convince evel</i>

51:07.330 --> 51:10.433
       <i> to do a real test,</i>
      <i> but he'd only do it</i>

51:10.500 --> 51:12.868
    <i> if it was done in secret</i>
          <i> so the press</i>

51:12.969 --> 51:15.504
   <i> wouldn't get any pictures</i>
       <i> of it or anything.</i>

51:19.042 --> 51:20.709
  <i> we thought it would make it.</i>

51:20.777 --> 51:23.612
    <i> but there was a problem</i>
      <i> with the parachute.</i>

51:23.713 --> 51:27.383
      <i> it deployed early...</i>

51:27.484 --> 51:30.486
    <i> and it also landed right</i>
  <i> in the middle of the river.</i>

51:30.587 --> 51:32.788
            saltman:
 <i> knievel was there to see that.</i>

51:32.889 --> 51:36.158
  i saw it, and i was wondering
          at that time

51:36.259 --> 51:37.793
what was going through his mind.

51:37.894 --> 51:41.163
    <i> i was thinking to myself</i>

51:41.264 --> 51:43.632
   <i> that he was really looking</i>
       <i> at his mortality,</i>

51:43.733 --> 51:45.134
         <i> and thinking,</i>
           <i> you know,</i>

51:45.235 --> 51:48.104
       <i> this might not be</i>
       <i> such a good idea.</i>

51:48.171 --> 51:52.074
   <i> however, give him credit,</i>
 <i> he was going through with it.</i>

51:54.611 --> 51:57.646
     branker: <i> at this point,</i>
  <i> we're batting zero for two,</i>

51:57.714 --> 52:01.183
  and the world is watching us.
    i mean, i-- i felt that.

52:01.251 --> 52:04.386
              man:
        <i> you'll make it!</i>

52:04.454 --> 52:07.490
           <i> you will!</i>
           <i> you will!</i>

52:07.591 --> 52:10.593
       saltman: <i> he became</i>
      <i> more and more surly,</i>

52:10.694 --> 52:12.761
 <i> screeching orders at everybody</i>
         <i> that he could,</i>

52:12.863 --> 52:15.431
          <i> belittling--</i>
  <i> he belittled little people.</i>

52:15.532 --> 52:17.199
       <i> he was just mean.</i>

52:17.267 --> 52:19.168
            branker:
        <i> about a week out</i>

52:19.269 --> 52:21.704
       <i> is when we started</i>
         <i> sensing things</i>

52:21.805 --> 52:23.706
       <i> not going our way</i>
        <i> with the press,</i>

52:23.807 --> 52:25.407
        <i> 'cause the press</i>
     <i> is up here living now,</i>

52:25.509 --> 52:27.343
      <i> an the press started</i>
     <i> to see the real evel.</i>

52:27.444 --> 52:30.546
            do one thing for me.

52:30.647 --> 52:33.215
           i do not
           ask for your respect,
           i demand it.

52:33.283 --> 52:36.719
    shelly gathered everybody
 around evel's trailer and says,

52:36.820 --> 52:40.189
  "why don't you just have him
  stand up so we can see him?"

52:40.290 --> 52:42.358
  'cause there was a big crowd
        of people there.

52:42.459 --> 52:47.263
       and evel heard that
    and came out, and, uh...

52:50.534 --> 52:53.302
   - i said have a smile
   on your face.
   -<i> i don't smile at anybody.</i>

52:53.370 --> 52:55.437
         all right, get him out.
         get him out. out.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.740
         go on, get out of here.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.742
    watt: <i> that's when he came</i>
 <i> down the stairs with his cane,</i>

52:59.843 --> 53:02.478
   <i> and he grabbed my camera,</i>
 <i> and he's a pretty strong guy.</i>

53:02.546 --> 53:05.047
      and grabbed my camera
   and started pushing me back

53:05.115 --> 53:07.750
 and whacking me and the camera
         with his cane.

53:07.817 --> 53:10.419
 man: <i> are you going to apologize</i>
       <i> to that cameraman</i>

53:10.487 --> 53:12.288
           <i> for roughing him up?</i>

53:12.389 --> 53:13.756
i wouldn't apologize,

53:13.823 --> 53:15.758
and if i see the little
son of a bitch again,

53:15.825 --> 53:17.326
i'll throw him out of here,
        how's that?

53:17.394 --> 53:18.994
            saltman:
      <i> as hard as we tried,</i>

53:19.095 --> 53:22.464
a lot of evel's true temperament
     came out to the press.

53:22.566 --> 53:23.899
          man: <i> i think</i>
          <i> you should apologize.</i>

53:24.000 --> 53:25.501
well, i wanna straighten
you out right now.

53:25.569 --> 53:27.937
number one, i was in
the sky cycle all day.

53:28.004 --> 53:30.139
number two, you are a guest
of mine in my press area.

53:30.207 --> 53:32.141
do you understand that?
and so was he.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.909
number three,
when i've been up
there all day

53:34.010 --> 53:35.644
and all the blood's come out
of my legs and my feet

53:35.745 --> 53:38.147
and gone to my head,
and i come down

53:38.215 --> 53:40.849
to want to get some rest
and get along with you people,

53:40.951 --> 53:43.485
you don't tell me to come out
and stand up and smile!

53:43.587 --> 53:46.255
if i want to come out
and try and get along with you,

53:46.356 --> 53:49.792
you should at least allow me
to sit down and smile!

53:49.859 --> 53:53.596
so tell him i said
to kiss my ass!

53:53.663 --> 53:55.798
   kazikas: <i> there was a point</i>
       <i> where we were all</i>

53:55.865 --> 53:58.634
     <i> kind of sitting around</i>
 <i> and saying, "the guy's a jerk.</i>

53:58.735 --> 54:01.437
        he's just a jerk.
          he's a bully.

54:01.504 --> 54:04.707
          he's a bore.
     what are we doing here?

54:04.774 --> 54:06.375
      the rest of the press
        can now thank you

54:06.476 --> 54:08.677
  because i am going to leave.
        how's that, boys?

54:08.778 --> 54:10.045
           <i> sayonara.</i>

54:15.051 --> 54:17.486

 <i> and it started getting crazy.</i>

          <i> every biker</i>

54:18.955 --> 54:20.723

54:20.824 --> 54:24.159

 <i> different motorcycling groups,</i>

54:24.227 --> 54:26.328
   <i> none of which you'd invite</i>
   <i> to your house for dinner.</i>

54:26.396 --> 54:29.298
  they gonna have a good time.
everyone gets loose around here.

54:29.399 --> 54:33.068
       high: <i> you could say</i>
    <i> it was like a woodstock,</i>

54:33.136 --> 54:36.205
       <i> but the evil twin</i>
         <i> of woodstock.</i>

54:36.306 --> 54:39.041
    <i> it was like not a happy</i>
        <i> flower children</i>

54:39.142 --> 54:40.643
  <i> sitting around in the rain.</i>

54:40.744 --> 54:43.312
        those guys were--
 i mean, they were really rough.

54:43.413 --> 54:45.681
  tonning: <i> wackos with tattoos</i>
     <i> all over their bodies</i>

54:45.782 --> 54:48.250
          drinking beer
     and screwing in public

54:48.318 --> 54:51.520
       <i> and all kinds of--</i>
 <i> yeah, it was-- it was bedlam.</i>

54:51.588 --> 54:55.090
        ( whistle blows )
      roach clips! papers!

54:55.158 --> 54:58.394
           hash pipes!
come get them while they're hot!

54:58.495 --> 55:00.195
rundle: <i> they had a marching band</i>
     <i> from butte high school</i>

55:00.297 --> 55:01.764
        <i> that was there.</i>

55:01.865 --> 55:06.201
       it was not a place
 for a butte high marching band

55:06.303 --> 55:08.504
         to be that day,
        i'd have to say.

55:08.605 --> 55:09.872
    right when we pulled in,

55:09.973 --> 55:12.374
         there was a man
      and woman naked, uh--

55:12.442 --> 55:15.711
      you know, having sex
    right there under a tree.

55:15.779 --> 55:18.280
      i saw all the people
       that were drinking

55:18.348 --> 55:23.085
        and smoking pot,
   and they were pretty wild.

55:23.153 --> 55:27.056
    ( band playing "the stars
     and stripes forever" )

55:27.157 --> 55:29.224
      we fired up the band.

55:29.326 --> 55:32.695
            it's like
     the whole place arose.

55:32.796 --> 55:35.264
           oh, they--
   the crowd went wild, yeah.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.634
  absolutely, they were totally
   prepared for a celebration.

55:38.702 --> 55:42.271
        lisac: <i> the crowd</i>
     <i> just started mingling</i>

55:42.339 --> 55:45.541
     and just wanted to play
        our instruments.

55:45.608 --> 55:48.444
     they tugged and pulled,
     and next thing we know

55:48.545 --> 55:52.781
we're separated a good 100 yards
 away from the rest of the band.

55:52.882 --> 55:54.616
  so we were basically fighting
         for our lives,

55:54.718 --> 55:56.051
   as far as i was concerned.

55:56.152 --> 55:58.754
         at that point,
    they just stuffed my tuba

55:58.822 --> 56:00.589
      full of everything--

56:00.690 --> 56:02.458
     beer bottles, popcorn,

56:02.525 --> 56:04.093
         peanuts, rocks.

56:04.160 --> 56:05.728
  i pulled a bra out of there.

56:05.795 --> 56:08.364
     i never played a note.

56:10.734 --> 56:13.902
      <i> we also had with us</i>
        <i> the drill team,</i>

56:14.003 --> 56:16.338
      <i> and the drill team,</i>
<i>their name was the purple bees,</i>

56:16.439 --> 56:19.641
   <i> and a good friend of mine,</i>
 <i> they tore her dress right off.</i>

56:19.709 --> 56:21.844
   totally tore her dress off.

56:21.911 --> 56:25.247
             i guess
     we all thought of this

56:25.348 --> 56:27.549
   as something different than
  what it was really gonna be.

56:30.086 --> 56:33.355
           john hood:
      <i> the crowd were given</i>
           <i> oh, beer,</i>

56:33.456 --> 56:35.824
        and when the beer
         was closed up,

56:35.925 --> 56:37.760
       that's when it got
         kind of rowdy.

56:37.827 --> 56:39.862
  rundle: <i> they actually rolled</i>
     <i> the beer trucks over--</i>

56:39.929 --> 56:43.966
 the semis, over on their side,
       shot the locks off,

56:44.067 --> 56:45.634
   <i> and everybody was walking</i>
       <i> through the camps</i>

56:45.735 --> 56:47.302
      <i> with cases of beer.</i>

56:47.370 --> 56:48.971
      <i> next thing you know,</i>
    <i> they took the outhouses,</i>

56:49.072 --> 56:50.539
     and they took 'em down,
        and they started

56:50.640 --> 56:52.808
     just dumping them over,
   and they lit them on fire.

56:52.909 --> 56:57.212
    <i> the place was absolutely</i>
 <i> out of control at that point.</i>

56:57.280 --> 57:01.517

 get bad without somebody dying.

   that's as simple as that--
   just as bad as it could be.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.904

57:49.933 --> 57:51.500

     everybody's gonna rush
   to that edge of the canyon

57:54.504 --> 57:56.238

58:12.055 --> 58:13.689

         <i> on this jump.</i>

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:27.208
  <i> uh, it was a different evel.</i>

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.644
    <i> i mean, he actually did</i>
        <i> practice jumps.</i>

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.579
i'm gonna go, frank.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.215
there's no wind gonna stop me,
not even a hurricane.

   <i> it was a very gutsy jump.</i>

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.656
      <i> the doctors told him</i>
 <i> just don't ever do that again.</i>

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.725
   you know, one little slip,
          wrong thing,

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:46.461

      have been paralyzed.

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.129
            reporter:
       <i> everything is go.</i>

     <i> off the approach ramp</i>
  <i> and on to the landing ramp.</i>

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.418

    <i> ( cheers and applause )</i>

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:34.108
boy, busted the motorcycle
right in half, frank.

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:36.043
         boy, it did come apart,
         didn't it?

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.779
     - boy, did i hit hard.
     - yeah, i know.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:43.384
           thank you.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:46.821
  this motorcycle is the finest
      machine in the world,

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.256
    as far as i am concerned.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.824
        it broke in half,
       but it held me up,

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:52.760
        and all i can say
    is thanks to number one,

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.162
   thanks to harley davidson.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.664
       you've been so good
    to me through the years.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:59.567
      i would like to tell
  all of you something, though,

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:02.837
      that-- that as far as
         i am concerned,

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:05.173
    i have jumped far enough.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.942
    today i'm gonna walk away
       from here with you,

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:10.278
     and i feel that's being
         a professional.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.014
    that's what i'm gonna do.

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:17.285
  knoxville: <i> king's island was</i>
<i>the longest jump of his career.</i>

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:20.288
 <i> it was the biggest television</i>
     <i> audience he ever had,</i>

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:22.490
           <i> and it was</i>
   <i> the highest-rated episode</i>

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.927
<i>of "wide world of sports" ever.</i>

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:27.462
    <i> he did some small jumps</i>
          <i> after that,</i>

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:30.298
       <i> but he never went</i>
        <i> that big again.</i>

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:33.000
      king's island was...

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:41.509
         the gunfighter
    putting away his pistols.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.383
     <i> if you were on a bike,</i>
     <i> you'd do stupid shit,</i>

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.153
  <i> but you would do stupid shit</i>
  <i> in the name of evel knievel.</i>

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.326
       hoffman: <i> i thought</i>
   <i> that's why you had a bike.</i>

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:00.528
          i didn't know
   you just rode bikes around.
   i thought the whole purpose

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.897
   of bikes were to hit things
       and fly off of 'em.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.232
    seth enslow: <i> we'd line up</i>
       <i> the neighbor kids</i>

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.033
     <i> and see who could jump</i>
         <i> more neighbors</i>

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:08.669
     <i> without landing on 'em</i>
     <i> and things like that,</i>

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.905
  but we just dreamed of having
    a motor between our legs.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:13.040
 i loved just going down steps,

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:14.675
   and i crashed all the time.

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.177
 you're like, yeah, i'm gonna be
     just like evel knievel

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.411
        only not as good.

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.917
                there's no way
                that a youngster

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:26.087
        is not going
        to not want to try to do
        what his hero does.

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.755
      i don't think there's
    anything wrong with a kid

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.690
  wanting to be an evel knievel

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.893
   any more than he'd wanna be
an o.j. simpson or frank gifford

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:35.096
or be any kind
of a professional athlete.

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:37.098
   - reporter:
   do you view him as a hero?
   - yeah.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.432
        - do you really?
        - yeah.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.268
he's one of the greatest heroes.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.670
         robbie knievel:
 <i> he was a hero to so many kids,</i>

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.506
        <i> but his own son</i>
      <i> was his biggest fan.</i>

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:50.611
    reporter: <i> this is robbie.</i>
  <i> look at this little guy go.</i>

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:53.447
       <i> wouldn't you know</i>
   <i> it would be the young one</i>
      <i> who would steal it.</i>

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.583
    <i> he's the one that's got</i>
  <i> to have the longest wheelie.</i>

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:59.220
         robbie knievel:
   <i> he totally saw me and him,</i>

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.122
        and it was like,
    "i'm gonna be you, dad."

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.624
    and the legend continues.

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.459
  i'm gonna jump the fountains
       at caesar's palace

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.295

    <i> ( cheers and applause )</i>

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:18.706
     that was for you, dad.

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:20.841
     knoxville: <i> yeah, robbie</i>
<i>broke all of his dad's records.</i>

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:23.811
  <i> i mean, hell, he could jump</i>
 <i> fourteen buses with no hands.</i>

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.417
     <i> but robbie was jumping</i>
          <i> on lighter,</i>

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:33.421
      <i> more powerful bikes</i>
<i>that were designed for jumping.</i>

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.056
     leeuwen: <i> he could jump</i>
  <i> farther and longer than evel</i>

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.757
      <i> and all that stuff,</i>
     <i> but it didn't matter.</i>

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.125
 <i> robbie couldn't tell a story.</i>

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:40.261
            you know,
      he was not a showman.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.929
knievel is the ultimate showman.

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:44.065
        a guy could sing

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.334
        longer and louder
       than elvis presley,

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.636
      but who gave a damn?

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:52.440
      he was elvis presley.
    my dad was evel knievel.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.516
     <i> he still wanted to be</i>
       <i> in the spotlight,</i>

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.685
       and he had to find
       other things to do

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:06.754
    to get himself attention.

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.689
    yeah, one of his projects
         was hollywood.

       <i> there was one guy</i>

 <i> evel had a movie-star quality</i>
           <i> about him.</i>

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:24.338
   there's no doubt about it.
  uh, not when he tried to act.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.207
      look at you, you're trying
      to destroy yourself.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.776
        if you don't believe me,
        here's the proof.

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:31.112
       i'm not gonna let you
       commit suicide around me.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.218
          he performed
        for the audience,

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.487
        but when it came
       to the acting part,

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:40.955
  i guess there's a difference.

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:43.658
       - that was too far!
       - stop it!

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.226

   - stop it, stop it!

you know, we've got
the wallendas on the highwire,

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.682
  and the mentalist on the edge
of the canyon on a motorcycle...

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.083
      saltman: <i> when i knew</i>
      <i> i was gonna take on</i>

 <i> the snake river canyon event,</i>

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:14.321
       i decided something
        very important--

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.090
   that i would write a book,

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.926
            a legacy,
     that people could read

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:23.164
about the evel knievel promotion
   of the snake river canyon.

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:26.701
  <i> and knievel, he was my 50/50</i>
     <i> partner, and he says,</i>

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:29.770
         <i> "don't forget,</i>
     <i> just tell the truth."</i>

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.372
      <i> so with permission,</i>

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.608
           <i> i carried</i>
   <i> an audio-cassette recorder</i>

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:36.577
 <i> during the evel knievel tour.</i>

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.222
   <i> if you listen to the tape,</i>
 <i> you can form your own opinion.</i>

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:21.388
  <i> and so when i wrote my book,</i>
  <i> i kept out a lot of things,</i>

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.224
         <i> stuff i would</i>
       <i> never write about,</i>

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.726
        'cause remember,
  when the book was coming out,

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.628
     i was still protecting
           his image.

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.331
        evel's attorney,
     he checked everything,

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:33.234
       told me that it had
   evel's approval in writing,

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.969
        and then the book
         was published.

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.572
     little: <i> i was at evel's</i>
       <i> compound one day,</i>

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.341
   and he throws me this book,

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:43.344
          and he says,
        "here, keep this.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.780
    it'll be worth some money
            someday."

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:49.784
    i open it up, here's all
     his footnotes in there.

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:53.287
  the first part of the book--
         "x-rated evel."

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:56.457
       he writes in there,
     "constitutes adultery."

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.761
    so right from the get-go,
   you could tell he was mad.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:03.097
         it just starts,
    and you can tell by the--

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:06.167
the farther it gets in the book,
       the madder he got.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.868
         "this is a lie
       and not accurate."

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.136
           ( laughs )

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:11.972
       "lies, lies, lies."

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.607
        i read the book,
       and you know what?

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:17.511
          i said, yeah,
       what's the problem?

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:20.948
   he could of said a lot more
     worse stuff. ( laughs )

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.683
 i read the book a couple times.

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:25.152
          i didn't see
       anything in it bad.
            nothing.

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:29.323

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.469
       i was on the phone
           with evel,

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:14.007
    and he started coughing,
     and the phone dropped,

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:15.775
    and he went unconscious.

01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:22.849
        ( voice breaks )
         so that was it.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.822
        but it was hard.

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.223
         i wasn't ready.

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:37.564
          he was ready.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.499
 and that's what was important.

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:54.147
     you just never thought
    that evel was gonna die.

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.983
      knoxville: <i> you know,</i>
     <i> he was indestructible,</i>

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.618
          <i> and then...</i>

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:04.057
   it... it just reminded you
       that he <i> was</i> human.

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:10.997
  i didn't lose the daredevil.

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:14.634
     <i> i lost this little kid</i>
        <i> who at one time</i>

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:16.536
   <i> i thought was my brother.</i>

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:22.075
  that's the indelible knievel
             to me.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:29.015
           knoxville:
<i>i still think he's a superhero.</i>

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:33.386
       <i> and, yeah, i know</i>
   <i> a more complete story now,</i>

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:37.157
<i>and some of the stuff is really</i>
    <i> heartbreaking, you know?</i>

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.825
           <i> but to me,</i>

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:43.363
  what he did transcends that.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:46.499
  most of us don't take chances
          in our lives.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.335
   most of us weren't willing
     to lay it on the line,

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:50.737
          <i> so to speak,</i>
          <i> like he was.</i>

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:57.944
        what my dad did,
  nobody's ever gonna do again.

01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:00.647
   but there is a little evel
          in all of us.

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:07.220
  i guess i'd like to have him
      remembered as, um...

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:10.456
           a man who,
        when he was down,

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:12.358
          got back up.

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:15.461
           <i> you know,</i>
         <i> he never quit.</i>

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:21.501
        saltman: <i> i think,</i>
      <i> in fairness to him,</i>

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:27.040
    they should not remember
     the evil that evel did.

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:32.378
 instead he should be remembered
   for the good things he did.

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.382
      <i> in times of stress,</i>

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:37.817
       <i> i believe somebody</i>
        <i> on a white horse</i>

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:40.320
      <i> wearing a white hat</i>
          <i> will arrive.</i>

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:43.056
    <i> that's the american way.</i>

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:45.992
      life's pretty tough.
           ( laughs )

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:48.394
  life can be pretty -- tough.

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:50.463
           and, uh...

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.401
   you need your heroes, man.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:58.338
