WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:12.253
<i>Okay! All right, ladies and gentlemen,
the final votes for tonight.</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:14.508
<i>Governor Calhoun, 420.</i>

00:14.598 --> 00:17.682
<i>Congressman Ryan, 453.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:22.263
<i>Senator Talbot, 1, 785.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.188
Boo!

00:24.274 --> 00:26.357
President Meyer, 1,817.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.105
No candidate has secured

00:28.195 --> 00:34.032
a delegate majority of 2,368,
so, we have no nominee.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.858
- Did we win?
- Oh, yeah.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.366
I'm the president,
and you're the First Lady.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.536
Oh, we would crush it.

00:39.623 --> 00:43.287
And it seems, we have ourselves
a deadlocked convention,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.164
the first since 1952.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.917
Senator Talbot has indeed
made a miraculous comeback.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.123
You know, it's worse
having to hear it from Mike.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.753
Furlong wants
to see all the candidates

00:51.843 --> 00:53.129
for a late-night pow-wow.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.961
- Uh, no offense, Marjorie.
- Some offense.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.921
You know, Mom,
you need to tell the party

00:57.015 --> 00:58.826
that they never should have
held the convention...

00:58.850 --> 01:00.307
- Oh, my God.
- ...in North Carolina.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.761
Their bathroom bill
is an absolute disgrace.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.096
Guys, who gives a shit
where people shit?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.352
That is literally the point, Mother.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.480
Okay, then we agree.
Right? Shut up.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.063
All right, we have to get in touch
with all the floor whips.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.217
- Right, okay, great.
- We have to make sure

01:14.241 --> 01:16.241
- our delegates hold.
- I'll whip the whips, ma'am.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.072
You know,
the Chinese are ready to fix...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.931
...this whole damn election

01:19.955 --> 01:20.955
if I can be the nominee.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.279
- I'm not here. Not hearing this.
- No, that is the plan.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.010 --> 01:35.093
- How you doin' there, John?
- Outstanding, ma'am.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.589
Ah, that's my hero.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.825
And keep on getting it out there
that I plan on choosing

01:38.849 --> 01:40.326
- Governor DeVito as my Veep.
- Right.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.620
'Cause, you know, we might get
a few more delegates out of this.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.933
- Wounded warrior, Roman Catholic...
- Oh, my God, is that still a thing?

01:46.023 --> 01:48.811
Two-time Ohio governor,
18 Electoral College votes.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.018
Yeah, most importantly,
he has a penis. Right, Governor?

01:53.155 --> 01:54.236
I'm still with you, ma'am!

01:54.323 --> 01:56.736
"Till the end,"
like we used to say back in Iraq.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.532
Might want to double-check that penis.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.619
That's Kent's job.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.223
Mr. Chairman,
I would just like to point out

02:02.247 --> 02:04.864
that the official count
cannot be trusted.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.915
Oh, no, Beautiful Mindfuck.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.038
You are not gonna desecrate
my convention

02:09.128 --> 02:11.496
with more
of this Muslim math nonsense.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.754
How do you explain
that when I add up my delegates

02:14.843 --> 02:17.005
- with Christian math...
- Amen.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.157
...the number is quite different
than the official total?

02:19.181 --> 02:20.825
Because you were born
with three umbilical cords

02:20.849 --> 02:21.849
wrapped around your neck,

02:21.933 --> 02:23.845
- Hep C Kevin McHale.
- No, I wasn't.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.268
- My apologies, Mr. Chairman.
- Madam President.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.096
What is Leon doing with her?

02:28.190 --> 02:29.271
Installing cameras

02:29.358 --> 02:31.350
- in all her closets and bathrooms.
- Right.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.605
So, what did I miss?
Did President Meyer find a way

02:33.695 --> 02:36.688
to steal the nomination from me,
like she stole South Carolina?

02:36.782 --> 02:41.197
Stealing South Carolina is the bedrock
of our political system, Senator.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.575
Oh, well, there it is,
that casual Meyer attitude

02:44.665 --> 02:47.203
towards criminal enterprise,
just like her husband.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.158
- Ex-husband.
- Step-husband.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.835
If you can't figure out
how to steal South Carolina,

02:51.922 --> 02:53.538
you have no business being president.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.432
- Oh, is that how you feel?
- Yes! Am I right?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.877
Hey! Hey! All right!

02:58.970 --> 03:01.508
Right now, every Sunday pundit
and poli-sci major

03:01.598 --> 03:05.512
is treating this brokered convention
like it's a big-titted college gymnast

03:05.602 --> 03:07.218
whose daddy fucked with her
just enough

03:07.312 --> 03:09.725
that she'll do some dirty shit,
but she can still cum.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.102
Hittin' a little
close to home there, Roger,

03:12.192 --> 03:13.899
minus the big-titted part.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.772
We've never had a complaint, have we?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.321
But if we don't pillow-smother
this sad grandma of a convention

03:19.408 --> 03:21.525
lickity-fuckin'- split,
we are gonna wind up

03:21.618 --> 03:23.075
with four more years of Montez

03:23.161 --> 03:25.494
clogging up the White House plumbing
with tampons.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.500
- That's not a problem for us.
- Okay, it's fine.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.407
Tomorrow's the second ballot, okay?

03:29.501 --> 03:32.335
None of these delegates
are bound to any candidate anymore.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.879
So, it's time to get out there
and start twisting some arms

03:34.965 --> 03:36.605
and pinching nipples.
And what else, Will?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.382
And may the best man win.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.462
And may the hairiest man zip-tie me
to a slaughterhouse drainage grate

03:42.556 --> 03:45.720
and make tender hate
to my rear and mouth,

03:45.809 --> 03:47.954
- in that order, at his leisure.
- Beautiful.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.391
Well done, pig. Dismissed.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.392
Selina, you got a minute?

03:52.482 --> 03:53.848
Roger, I don't want to hear it.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.650
Selina, we need a ticket.
Just offer her Veep.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.854
You and Kemi scissoring
at the top of the ticket

03:58.947 --> 04:00.483
is gonna make everyone rock hard.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.110
I don't need her, okay?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.032
I've got the diving bell
and the governor.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.360
- Come on.
- Just make the deal!

04:05.454 --> 04:06.615
Or what's gonna happen, Will?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.823
Shit, Will left. It was a good one.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.657
Sorry to miss that.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.414
- Ma'am.
- Oh, God. Go away, Amy. Really.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.710
Your voice is like a crow.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.454
- But ma'am, I just want to discuss...
- No! I just cannot...

04:17.548 --> 04:21.293
There is no place for Jonah Ryan
in my administration.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.298
Or anywhere in the universe

04:23.388 --> 04:25.188
where the building blocks of life
are present.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.257
Okay? I'll be right back.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.637
- Uh, <i>caballeros.
- Caballeros!</i>

04:29.728 --> 04:32.266
- Do you wanna close the thing?
- Nice try, Amy.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.416
Ben, we've already got Florida.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.792
- Amy? Amy?
- We've got a butt-load of delegates.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.399
Your offer is as appealing
as a Sriracha enema.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.194
So, fuck your offer, and fuck you.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.800
- It's always good to see ya, Amy.
- You, too. I miss you guys.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.032
- Keith, you havin' fun?
- Yes, thank you.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.575
Okay, well, I have to go.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.323
Thank you! Oh...
I hope I can count on your support.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.810
What are they clapping like that for?

04:52.834 --> 04:53.870
Congratulations, ma'am.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.543
You just broke North Carolina's
transgender bathroom law.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.630
What?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.502
I've been fielding media requests
all morning, Richard.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.504
The keynote speech was such a hit.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.507
<i>New York Times?</i> Krugman
is positively creaming his khakis.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.554
Amazing speech last night,
Governor Splett.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.535
- Thank you. Thank you.
- What state are you a delegate from?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.176
- The Ukraine.
- A Wisconsin sister state.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.830
Can I get a photo with you,
please, now?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.575
- Sure.
- Absolutely not. Thank you, though.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.084
How about I get one of you two?
Sound good?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.394
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, that's fine.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.087
So sorry your wife couldn't make
the convention, Congressman.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.339
- We have to go. Let's go. Come on.
- Good seeing you.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.363
Enjoy the convention.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.111
Morning, ma'am. Some disturbing
rumblings from Justice...

05:26.243 --> 05:27.243
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.785
What? It's Okay, Ben.
You've seen behind the curtain.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.016
My source tells me
that Kemi's been kicking up some dirt

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
on the Meyer Fund.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.117
- Oh, come... Well, that's Leon.
- I don't know.

05:36.211 --> 05:39.124
Why does everybody get good
at their job after I fire them?

05:39.214 --> 05:40.921
- Lip time. Let's do lips.
- No, no, no.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.624
I want to save the Dubonnet
for when I get the nomination.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.335
Okay? 'Cause it's discontinued.
I'm wearing this now.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.949
There's a simple solution
for this, okay?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.306
- What?
- Just ask Kemi to be your Veep.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.930
I cannot stand her!

05:53.019 --> 05:55.477
And I don't say that
about a lot of people.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.772
Plus, she called me
a criminal last night.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.145
Kent and I were up all night
doing the numbers...

06:00.235 --> 06:03.569
You know, in the words
of the great Eleanor Roosevelt,

06:03.655 --> 06:06.523
- I would rather cheese-grater my clit.
- Okay.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.699
- So, we'll put a pin in that.
- That, too.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.198
Morning. Mom, you're
a regular bathroom warrior.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.029
- Oh, really?
- We're very proud of you

06:13.123 --> 06:14.830
for standing up
for the trans community.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.626
Thank you, Peppermint Patty,
but you're not a...

06:18.712 --> 06:21.045
- Oh, no, ma'am. I'm a cis woman.
- Right.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.839
- That's not a crazy question to ask.
- Not at all.

06:23.925 --> 06:28.010
You and your gay pals
can make me the grand marshal

06:28.096 --> 06:31.214
of the next parade that you have
that messes up all the traffic.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.891
Actually, ma'am,
it's a myth that lesbians and gay men

06:33.977 --> 06:35.343
have any natural affinity.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.475
As a matter of fact, Gertrude Stein
was physically disgusted

06:38.565 --> 06:40.272
- by male homosexuals.
- Excuse me?

06:40.358 --> 06:42.065
How'd she feel about tedious lesbians?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.152
Big fan, ma'am.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.524
So, how's the piss heard
around the world

06:49.618 --> 06:50.904
playing with all the delegates?

06:50.994 --> 06:54.362
Ma'am, the NYPD found a van
full of explosives at Kennedy Airport.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.448
This is why everyone
should just fly private.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.519
You've been completely
knocked out of the news cycle.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.624
Oh, God.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.579
Ma'am, Governor DeVito is here
to speak with you about his speech.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.255
Okay, great! John-boy!

07:06.343 --> 07:07.343
Johnny?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.300
Hmm.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.763
Is he...

07:11.139 --> 07:13.256
Ah! And there he is!

07:13.350 --> 07:15.467
- Governor DeVito.
- Yes. My running mate.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.552
Well, not literally, of course, but...

07:17.646 --> 07:20.184
Did you get a chance to review
my nominating speech?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.185
I did,
and I have to tell you something.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.732
It is a delight.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.258
- I wouldn't change a word. Right, Ben?
- Awesome. Absolutely.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.155
So, I'm gonna actually talk
to Kent about some numbers.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.927
- Kent.
- The president, she loved your speech.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.910
Especially the line
"There are really three Americas."

07:33.995 --> 07:35.406
I'm so glad you responded to that.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.329
She's gonna use that in her speech.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.077
Pretend to talk to me about numbers.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.454
The most compelling number to me
is not a number at all,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.456
- it's a concept.
- I said pretend, okay?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.959
I was pretending.
My favorite number is Euler's number.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.289
She's also gonna take the line,

07:47.342 --> 07:49.459
"No matter what,
I will always stand for America."

07:49.552 --> 07:51.669
- That's a reference to my leg.
- She'll tweak it.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.199
Okay. So, are we good, then?
Everything cool?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.805
- Great. All set.
- Okay. Fantastic.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.223
Thank you so much for coming.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.222
Really. Honestly. Bye-bye. Take care.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.764
So good seein' ya.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.190
Take good care.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.442
- Madam President.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.191
We're still good
on the Veep slot, right?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.146
Oh, yeah, 100%. You're my Veep.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.608
- All right.
- Great.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.902
See you soon.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.032
I want to offer Buddy Calhoun Veep.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.478
- Okay.
- 'Cause with his delegates

08:22.502 --> 08:24.414
and all that Bible-y BS,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.440
the rest of the delegates'll
have to fall in line,

08:26.464 --> 08:29.502
and Kemi can go and suck
lecture-circuit dick in hell.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.254
And by "hell,"
I mean The Kennedy School.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.630
- Hey, ma'am.
- Yeah.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.241
The floor whips are picking up a rumor

08:34.304 --> 08:36.297
that Buddy is flirting
with endorsing Kemi.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.191
Oh, please.
Buddy's not flirting with anything

08:38.268 --> 08:40.429
that's not wearing
a leather vest and a Nazi cap.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
Hey, guys.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.221
<i>God created men's rooms
and women's rooms,</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:45.931
<i>not "everyone rooms".</i>

08:46.026 --> 08:48.109
I don't think Buddy's
gonna be taking your Veep slot.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.560
<i>I don't want to go into a bathroom</i>

08:49.654 --> 08:52.271
<i>and be next to a woman
who is looking at my genitals.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:54.607
I want that person that I'm next to,

08:54.701 --> 08:56.909
to be a man,
or, better yet, lots of men.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.157
Glory, glory, hole-elujah.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.955
Ma'am, if Governor Calhoun
is joining forces with Kemi...

09:02.042 --> 09:03.811
- We've gotta call Kemi right away.
- No!

09:03.835 --> 09:06.578
Not her! We're gonna call Amy...

09:06.671 --> 09:08.287
- Brookheimer.
- Brookheimer.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.776
What are you guys doing here?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.820
You here to see me get interviewed
by Mike on CBS News?

09:12.844 --> 09:14.836
Oh, I wish,
but I'm in a bit of a rush.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.966
I've gotta go
be interviewed by Mike on CBS.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.451
Guess that means you've been bumped.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.161
Although, you know what?
ABC News is doing a piece

09:20.185 --> 09:22.643
on presidential also-rans
who can almost suck their own dicks.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.498
So, while you're in makeup,
why don't you go talk to them?

09:24.522 --> 09:25.888
Oh, like you've never tried.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.043
I'm probably gonna need that mic.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.231
You came to the convention
as Governor Richard Splett of Iowa,

09:30.320 --> 09:33.358
but after your electrifying speech
just two nights ago,

09:33.448 --> 09:36.737
party insiders are calling you
Richard Splett, "future of the party."

09:36.826 --> 09:38.679
Honestly, I'm glad that what I said
resonated with folks.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.616
Plus, it gave me a chance
to break out my ASL skills.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.325
You know,
for the deaf American delegates.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.751
Yeah. All right,
let's talk turkey, Governor.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.829
- Wonderful pets.
- What about all these rumors

09:49.923 --> 09:52.040
that Senator Talbot is talking to you

09:52.133 --> 09:54.216
about a position
in her administration?

09:54.302 --> 09:57.636
When you listen to rumors,
you rue more than...

09:57.722 --> 09:59.366
Nope. I don't know
where I was going with that.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.926
Works in sign language.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.219
Very cagey. Jane, back to you.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.046
- All clear!
- Thanks for having me.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.273
Richard, that was fantastic.
<i>Us Weekly</i> wants to do a piece on you.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.170
Twenty-five Things
That No One Knows About You.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.685
Well, number one is, I love lists.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.190
- Oh, Dan!
- Oh, hey, man.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.987
- What kind of suit is that?
- Uh...

10:16.074 --> 10:17.190
Hugo Boss?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.946
- What's wrong with the suit?
- Oh, it's not network.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.571
<i>Hello, fellow Americans!</i>

10:23.665 --> 10:25.184
- Ma'am. You wanted to see me?
- Ben. Move.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.201
Amy, we've been working together
a really long time,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.752
it just occurred to me,
and you've always been kind of like...

10:30.839 --> 10:32.455
- Daughter?
- ...a sister to me.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.756
More like a childless aunt.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.153
I just thought for old times' sake,
I might throw you a bone.

10:36.177 --> 10:40.387
Have Jonah instruct
his delegates of Dr. Moreau

10:40.473 --> 10:43.591
to back me
on the second ballot tonight,

10:43.685 --> 10:46.849
and we might be able
to find something for him at...

10:46.938 --> 10:50.648
Ben? Where can he do
the least amount of harm?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.310
- EPA.
- Perfect.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.781
What is happening?

10:59.868 --> 11:02.360
- Was she always like this?
- It used to be worse.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.910
You haven't heard.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.158
I haven't heard what, Amy?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.784
Oh, shit.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.663
The suspect in the JFK bombing

11:09.752 --> 11:13.917
is one Mr. Abdul Azeem,
a high school mathematics teacher

11:14.007 --> 11:16.841
whose Facebook page
is all about radical Islam

11:16.926 --> 11:19.794
- and trigonometry.
- So are a lot of people's.

11:19.888 --> 11:20.888
Move. Move!

11:20.972 --> 11:24.215
<i>...Azeem teaches seventh grade algebra
and eighth grade trigonometry...</i>

11:24.309 --> 11:27.017
Jonah was right.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.267
He was spectacularly right!

11:30.356 --> 11:32.393
And you know what
that makes me, sister?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.190
- Spitty?
- The campaign manager

11:34.277 --> 11:37.441
for the next President
of the United States!

11:37.530 --> 11:41.524
So, if you want to discuss
potential opportunities for yourself

11:41.618 --> 11:44.031
in the Ryan administration,

11:44.120 --> 11:47.454
maybe I'll throw you a bone.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.709
- Ma'am, this is bad.
- I know.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.457
Do you want me to take care of Amy?

11:55.757 --> 11:59.250
For the last year,
I have been crisscrossing the country,

11:59.344 --> 12:03.679
warning America about the threat
of math to our way of life.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.178
- Yeah!
- Which is why, "President Meyer,

12:06.267 --> 12:09.055
Senator Talbot, and Governor Calhoun,"

12:09.145 --> 12:11.137
I have something to say to you.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.563
I told you so!

12:12.649 --> 12:14.606
- He told you so!
- Yeah!

12:14.692 --> 12:15.808
Oh, hey...

12:15.902 --> 12:18.189
Do you remember
my five-alarm hottie of a wife, Beth?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.020
She just got out of rehab today.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.606
Yeah! And plus,
while she was in there,

12:22.700 --> 12:24.987
she dropped a couple pounds
in all the right places,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.661
so, she's hella even hotter
than she was before.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.455
- Kill her!
- Yeah! I mean, not her, man,

12:30.541 --> 12:32.248
but yeah, sure.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.078
Look, I love America,

12:35.171 --> 12:37.834
but it is time to face facts.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.091
This is a horrific country
that is falling apart

12:41.177 --> 12:43.965
because it is full of people
who are different than me.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.717
I was right!

12:45.807 --> 12:48.094
And that means I should be president!

12:48.184 --> 12:50.346
Thank you! Thank you!

12:50.436 --> 12:54.976
That is 34 more delegates from Selina
and 17 from Kemi.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.228
- We have Florida...
- That's right, guys,

12:57.318 --> 13:01.153
next stop, the White House,
and then it's payback time!

13:01.239 --> 13:03.071
- Mom!
- Hi, Clay!

13:03.157 --> 13:04.819
- She's out?
- Oh, no, I'm all better.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.445
- Hi, Beth.
- Oh, hi, Amber.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.949
We just got denounced by the ACLU.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.076
We are going to win this thing!

13:12.166 --> 13:15.079
- Yes!
- Jonie, my boy!

13:15.169 --> 13:16.376
- Fuck me!
- We did it!

13:16.462 --> 13:19.626
Ever since you were little,
I've been telling your mom,

13:19.716 --> 13:22.379
"Someday that beautiful,
brilliant boy of yours

13:22.468 --> 13:24.255
"is gonna do great things!"

13:24.345 --> 13:26.962
I thought you told my mom
to sell me to a child molester

13:27.056 --> 13:28.718
and use the money
to get her tubes tied.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.969
Eh, we're family.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.346
Come here, you!

13:32.437 --> 13:35.396
You know, the Jews have a word
for this feeling I'm having right now.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.724
I can't remember it. It sounds like
three Germans cumming real hard

13:38.818 --> 13:40.605
inside something
that doesn't want them to.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.403
Oh, Jewish is
such a beautiful language.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.199
That's not the only reason I'm here.
I come bearing gifts!

13:47.285 --> 13:51.245
New Hampshire's 27 delegates
are yours!

13:51.331 --> 13:52.867
Thank you, Uncle Jeff!

13:52.957 --> 13:55.199
- Oh, my God, baby.
- Get me Vermont.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.707
- God, yes! This is Jeff Kane. Mmm-hmm.
- I think I can sweet-talk them.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.879
Yeah, Jeff Kane.
Who am I speaking with?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.131
Oh, how's your dad?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.549
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.171
Okay, shut the fuck up!

14:06.262 --> 14:08.595
Listen, you Subaru-driving bull dykes!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.764
You better back Jonah
on the next ballot,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.341
or you will be leaf-peeping

14:12.435 --> 14:15.928
from inside your own
maple syrup-soaked assholes!

14:17.982 --> 14:20.599
I'll give 'em five minutes,
then I'll hit 'em with bad cop.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.776
<i>They're calling it Ryan Fever.</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:25.980
<i>The former congressman's message
is finding a new audience...</i>

14:26.074 --> 14:29.738
Assemblyman, I have been
to Buffalo six times,

14:29.827 --> 14:31.614
and I'm not even a serial killer.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.570
So I... Okay, forget it.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.872
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- What? What?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.824
The captain of the Texas delegation

14:37.919 --> 14:42.254
says that all of his bum steers
are stampeding towards Jonah!

14:42.340 --> 14:43.734
- No.
- No, no. We cannot lose Texas.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.124
- No.
- Texas is our firewall!

14:45.218 --> 14:48.461
Right, whoa, listen, Ben, you gotta
go back to Texas right now, okay?

14:48.554 --> 14:52.389
And just tell 'em they can violate me
with their assault rifles

14:52.475 --> 14:53.966
and a full slab of ribs

14:54.060 --> 14:57.349
on top of a stack
of slavery-free history textbooks.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.499
- You gotta go do that, Ben.
- Yeah.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.515
- Go do that right now.
- Texas is our firewall.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.044
- Yeah, do it.
- Ma'am. Ma'am?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.545
- Yeah, what is it?
- You need to see this.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.856
<i>We never got proper answers</i>

15:05.947 --> 15:08.530
<i>about the Meyer Fund
or its many foreign donors.</i>

15:08.616 --> 15:10.198
- This is Leon.
<i>- That is why I've asked</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:11.741
<i>the Justice Department and the FBI</i>

15:11.828 --> 15:14.411
<i>- to reopen its investigation.</i>
- Oh, my God.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.160
<i>The president was in close contact
with her husband Andrew Meyer...</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:18.250
The FBI?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.770
<i>...up until
his extremely suspicious death.</i>

15:19.794 --> 15:23.253
Why is this so hard?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.294
I just wanna be president.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.168
Do you want six almonds?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.503
No!

15:31.764 --> 15:35.098
This, Kent, is why I was right
not to offer her Veep.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.471
- She's the worst.
- Yeah.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.394
Ma'am, all due respect,

15:39.480 --> 15:42.644
maybe you should consider
being her Veep.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.144
That's not fucking funny, Kent.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.571
I haven't been funny since 1987.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.990
- Uh, Ma'am?
- What?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.612
Adios, New Mexico.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.391
- Oh, hey, Ben.
- Out of my way.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.415
Sorry. Captain.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.991
- Jesus.
- At least he's getting some exercise.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.793
Oh, yes!
<i>Politico's</i> reporting

16:03.880 --> 16:06.150
that Jonah's talking to you
about the Secretary of Commerce.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.712
I wish. Sounds much better than
the conversation we were having

16:08.801 --> 16:10.212
about why his urine is pink.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.303
We ruled out beets

16:11.387 --> 16:12.448
because he doesn't know
what those are.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.575
Then had to rule it right back in
for the same reason.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.966
Richard, look,
there was no offer, okay?

16:17.059 --> 16:19.472
It was me, all right?
I pulled that turd out of my ass,

16:19.562 --> 16:21.415
covered it in ketchup,
and <i>Politico</i> asked for seconds.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.749
You could've ended
that sentence at "me."

16:22.773 --> 16:23.876
All right, listen, one thing is clear

16:23.900 --> 16:25.983
after this runaway-Ferris wheel
of a convention,

16:26.068 --> 16:28.748
and that's that Montez is gonna be
president for another four years.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.966
Makes sense. She made me proud
to be an American again.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.277
Okay, but after that,
it's Splett time.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.653
We can't call it that

16:34.744 --> 16:36.827
unless we want to get sued
by my uncle's podcast.

16:36.913 --> 16:41.499
No, Senator, this whole Meyer Fund
story is a distraction, sir,

16:41.584 --> 16:44.668
the way a magician does tricks
to distract you

16:44.754 --> 16:47.371
from how depressing his life is.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.548
- And I'm gonna... I'll call you back.
- I...

16:49.634 --> 16:52.092
So, what'd you find out?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.545
- What?
- Ajai... Ajai...

16:54.639 --> 16:56.005
"Ajai"?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.076
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He's having a heart attack!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.183
- Eighth time's the charm.
- Oh, my God!

17:00.269 --> 17:01.851
Stay here with us, Ben!

17:01.938 --> 17:04.896
I don't know the names
of any of the floor whips.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.723
We need EMTs
up at the Meyer box, stat.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.981
White male, type 2 diabetes...
also type 1.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.673
Ma'am, there's something happening
out on the floor.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.634
Ma'am, there's something happening
on the floor you need to see.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.886
I'm gonna roll you over, Ben.
I'm gonna roll you over.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.195
No, no! No.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.406
- What?
- Just look down there.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.017
Draft Tom James!

17:21.499 --> 17:23.161
You know, I just want to say,

17:23.251 --> 17:26.493
I was roadkill on the side
of the political highway.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.875
One of the nice things
about being dead is,

17:29.966 --> 17:31.582
it gives you time to think.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.588
Also, fewer telemarketers.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.553
But I thought, and I thought

17:36.639 --> 17:39.222
that I don't like the direction
our party is taking.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.846
Maybe the reason
we can't find a nominee is,

17:41.936 --> 17:44.349
everyone's just saying
the same old same-old.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.771
- Run, Tom, run!
- Run, Tom, run! Run...

17:46.857 --> 17:48.644
What do you think I'm trying to do?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.976
Powerful words from Tom James.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.936
Let's go now to Michael McLintock

17:53.030 --> 17:55.397
on the convention floor
with Senator Tom James,

17:55.491 --> 17:58.780
whose potential Hail Mary
is gaining steam.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.197
I'm reading the wrong card.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.454
<i>Many now say Tom James
is the only answer they'll accept</i>

18:06.544 --> 18:08.581
<i>as the brokered convention drags on.</i>

18:08.671 --> 18:11.459
I honestly think I might be in hell.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.609
No such place, ma'am.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.545
The concept of hell
is a cultural memory

18:14.635 --> 18:18.379
of pre-Mosaic child sacrifice
among proto-Judean peoples.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.215
- You're making a strong case for hell.
- Tom played it perfectly.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.268
He'll clinch the nomination
on tomorrow night's ballot.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.973
Knock, knock.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.438
Take State.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.140
Senator.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.567
- Here to rub it in, Tom?
- No rubbing.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.690
Gary. Get.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.440
No, I just came by to see how Ben was.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.366
My first congressional race.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.740
Ben can't have been
more than 140 years old.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.822
He ran the other guy,
wiped the floor with me.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.454
Well, they may have to put him
in a medically induced coma, so...

18:48.544 --> 18:49.785
It's what he always wanted.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.415
All right, let's go.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.505
Start your gloating,

18:52.590 --> 18:55.583
make whatever insulting offer
it is you're gonna make.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.987
I didn't come here to make an offer.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.593
I don't have the patience for this.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.240
All right?
And I'm certainly not gonna beg.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.847
I'm not asking you to beg.
There's nothing to beg for.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.266
You don't have
a political future, Selina.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.390
That is your punishment.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.973
Punishment?
What are you talking about?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.650
I have people who like me,
lots of people with signs,

19:13.736 --> 19:16.103
"New Selina Now," that is working.
That...

19:16.197 --> 19:18.359
The party and the nation
will never forget

19:18.449 --> 19:20.486
all that door you pushed open,

19:20.576 --> 19:24.365
yes, backwards and in heels.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.662
Hang in there.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.576
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.412
Please, come on. If...

19:33.506 --> 19:37.750
Tom, when we're not
the worst team ever,

19:37.843 --> 19:39.800
we make a really good team!

19:39.887 --> 19:40.887
Please!

19:42.139 --> 19:43.255
Oh, Madam President.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.636
Senator, the New York delegation
is on the phone.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.433
Well, it's been fun.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.230
Let's do this again at Ben's
next cardiopulmonary event.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.936
I'll wave at you from the stage.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.312
Yeah, well, that was gloating.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.065
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.616
Wipe that grin-eating dick
off your face.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.133
I could use a drink.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.465
Yeah. Me, too.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.135
Tom James.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.972
Kent says he'll take it
on tomorrow night's ballot.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.852
I think this is it for me, too.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.480
Oh, no. You're gonna be fine.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.482
You're gonna be good as new,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.905
and then we'll figure out
my next move.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.859
You know, I've had a dozen
heart attacks, and...

20:44.952 --> 20:48.116
You know, if I play my cards right,
I'll have a dozen more,

20:48.205 --> 20:50.413
but I think this is my last rodeo.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.992
No, Ben! You're my hatchet man.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.919
You're the hatchet man.
I need you.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.884
How can I
do this without you?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.927
Don't be an idiot, Selina.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.594
You know exactly what to do.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.684
No.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.438
Yeah.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.814
Yeah.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.689
Okay.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.533
Hey, do me a favor.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.868
What?

21:30.164 --> 21:33.123
Don't tell my wife and kids, okay?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.916
I mean, I could really use the break.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.207
That's not a problem.
I've never met 'em.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.562
Ma'am.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.732
Okay.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.858
Tom's making a move on New York,

22:00.945 --> 22:04.655
so, you get ahold
of Governor Schnozzlestein right now,

22:04.740 --> 22:06.402
you tell him I want
to see him tonight.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.279
I'm not gonna let them
take this from me.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.860
- Mmm.
- Okay? Go.

22:11.997 --> 22:12.997
Okay.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.660
Can't say I blame you.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.588
I mean, that Nutmeg State indefinable
really turns my hydrant on.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.040
The only difference is,

22:23.133 --> 22:26.251
that I was the most exciting
conquest of his life,

22:26.345 --> 22:29.463
and you just had the motel room
closest to the ice machine.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.077
I don't know what
you're talking about,

22:31.141 --> 22:32.577
because I am the Senator's
chief of staff.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for now,

22:34.144 --> 22:36.978
but trust me, he will never see you

22:37.064 --> 22:41.024
as anything other than
the TGI Friday's hostess on Proactiv

22:41.110 --> 22:43.727
who lets him bend you over his desk,

22:43.821 --> 22:47.110
while you close your eyes
to avoid coming face-to-face

22:47.199 --> 22:50.317
with that framed photo
of his family's trip to Aspen,

22:50.411 --> 22:54.075
while he drowns
your Little Mermaid back tat

22:54.164 --> 22:56.497
in a pool of jizz

22:56.584 --> 22:58.246
and admires his own reflection.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.871
- Jesus.
- Wow.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.078
I just hate to see smart women

23:02.172 --> 23:05.461
throw away their political careers
on powerful men

23:05.551 --> 23:08.669
who only see them as the gash
of least resistance.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.556
Mmm.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.969
I mean, you strike me
as a smart woman.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.304
Are you?

23:20.190 --> 23:21.351
Yeah, well...

23:24.361 --> 23:26.102
New York is in the bag.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.525
Congressman, how do you
take your coffee?

23:31.619 --> 23:33.360
- Decaf.
- Okay.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.653
No?

23:34.747 --> 23:37.080
Yup. Here we go.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.749
So, Congressman, tell me something.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.999
What can we offer up
to the Montana delegation

23:43.088 --> 23:44.670
that would really dick-slap 'em?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.067
And I mean that in a good way,
of course.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.111
And I'll tell you something else.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.171
Where is she?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.462
You fucking monster!

23:51.555 --> 23:54.889
- Excuse me for half a sec.
- You soulless, conniving cunt!

23:54.975 --> 23:57.968
Oh, I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:58.062 --> 24:01.021
Oh, unless it's this, right here?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.644
<i>The moment I began
working for Senator James,</i>

24:03.734 --> 24:07.648
<i>his behavior was unprofessional
in a sexual manner.</i>

24:07.738 --> 24:10.025
- Is that the problem?
- Fuck!

24:10.115 --> 24:12.198
<i>Senator James took advantage
of his power over me.</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:13.616
He did what?

24:13.702 --> 24:16.410
<i>I had to endure sex acts
that included...</i>

24:16.497 --> 24:18.079
Yeah, it's so great.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.623
- What did you offer her?
- I didn't offer her anything.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.575
I mean, I helped her with the wording.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.206
- Oh, this... Fuck!
- Shh! No, look.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.941
This is my favorite part
right here, actually.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.925
<i>I was just this naive,
innocent young woman who had dreams...</i>

24:30.010 --> 24:33.594
"Innocent young woman."
That's hilarious, don't you think?

24:33.681 --> 24:37.345
<i>But that girl doesn't exist anymore.
She's dead.</i>

24:37.434 --> 24:39.141
<i>- Murdered by Tom James.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.392
That is actually all me.
I will take credit for that.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.315
She didn't want to do it,
but I was like, "Oh, you've got to!"

24:45.401 --> 24:48.565
My wife, my pregnant wife,
is not answering the phone.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.317
I am now a national fucking pariah!

24:51.407 --> 24:52.739
Why would you do this, Selina?

24:52.825 --> 24:56.910
I guess that the Tom James charm
only goes so far with the ladies.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.239
That's one theory, but...
Oh, listen, while I've got you.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.325
Is it okay
if I don't wave to you from the stage?

25:03.419 --> 25:07.288
Because with all of this,
I need to keep my distance.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.338
You understand that, right? Excuse me.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.796
I'm so sorry for that
little minor interruption.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.344
What the fuck are you?

25:15.431 --> 25:16.592
Bye, Tom.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.384
Toodle-oo.

25:22.730 --> 25:27.145
So emotional, right?
This is why we need a woman in office.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.565
So? What else
do we need to talk about?

25:34.658 --> 25:37.947
- Federal lands.
- They need to be protected.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.654
- We need more drilling.
- For drilling purposes.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.284
Let's frack the crap out of it.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.625
<i>Governor Calhoun, what do I
have to do to get your support?</i>

25:45.711 --> 25:47.828
- President Meyer, I'm a simple man...
- I see that.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.082
- ...of faith.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.835
But after this bathroom incident...

25:50.924 --> 25:53.007
That was just an accident. Really.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.631
Free to pee, you and me, right?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.805
Madam President, homosexuality
is no laughing matter.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.349
- Okay.
- Pernicious homosexuals are luring

26:01.435 --> 26:04.348
decent, God-fearing heterosexual men

26:04.438 --> 26:08.682
into sin and sweaty degradation.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.310
Mmm.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.191
You know, Buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

26:14.281 --> 26:17.240
It... It happens, and...

26:17.326 --> 26:19.943
- You can't beat yourself up about it.
- What?

26:20.037 --> 26:21.556
Never mind. I hear what you're saying.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.580
Let's move forward.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.203
Yes. Governor,
I am prepared to offer you

26:26.293 --> 26:27.875
Secretary of Education.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.540
Well, ma'am.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.631
How about that?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.126
As excited as I would be

26:33.217 --> 26:35.425
to remove dinosaur theory
from the curriculum,

26:35.511 --> 26:39.300
I am just a little bit uneasy about
all this Meyer Fund scuttlebutt...

26:39.389 --> 26:40.596
I'll kill gay marriage.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.637
In exchange for your support,

26:43.727 --> 26:48.472
I will raw-dog a plank
right up our party's platform,

26:48.565 --> 26:52.980
and I will outlaw same-sex marriage.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.982
Governor, can I get an amen?

26:55.072 --> 26:57.940
You can get an amen,
and I'll throw in a hallelujah.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.774
- I love it.
- And my endorsement.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.110
- Thank you, sir. Wonderful!
- Wow. Wow. Yeah!

27:02.204 --> 27:04.644
- I think we're buddies now, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah, very much.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.039
Can you be a buddy with
someone of the opposite sex?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.960
Oh, well, under certain circumstances,
yeah, we are. Yeah.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.953
- So, Buddy up! Buddy up!
- Buddy up!

27:12.047 --> 27:14.960
That's a great expression.
Thank you so, so much.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.543
He is not just gay,
he is Sam Rayburn gay.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.003
Impressive negotiation, ma'am,

27:20.097 --> 27:23.716
but we are still
approximately 662 votes short.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.471
- I am well aware.
- Good.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.054
Ma'am. You wanted to see me?

27:29.148 --> 27:30.389
That's incorrect.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.267
Not in that outfit.
But yeah, come on in.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.361
Amy, um...

27:37.948 --> 27:39.064
Um...

27:43.829 --> 27:46.537
I want to offer Jonah the VP slot.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.623
- What?
- What?

27:47.708 --> 27:49.870
Yeah. It's the only move
we have left now,

27:49.960 --> 27:51.521
and we're gonna
have to get it done today.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.958
Oh, ma'am, there are still
numerous permutations

27:54.047 --> 27:55.775
that can play out here.
You don't have to do this.

27:55.799 --> 27:58.507
Do the goddamn Islamic math.
You're the numbers guy.

27:58.594 --> 27:59.960
Fuck the numbers!

28:00.053 --> 28:03.592
I will not be part of a campaign,
let alone an administration,

28:03.682 --> 28:06.140
that includes Jonah Ryan
as Vice President!

28:06.226 --> 28:08.309
That is an entirely
unacceptable outcome.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.604
Amy, you wanna talk
some sense into him?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.807
- Don't do it.
- What?

28:13.901 --> 28:17.645
Don't make Jonah your VP.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.400
Wow. You know what I just remembered?

28:19.489 --> 28:23.608
You are a terrible campaign manager.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.285
Ma'am, you can't let
an embittered, vindictive,

28:26.371 --> 28:30.206
narcissistic man-child be one
heartbeat away from the presidency,

28:30.292 --> 28:32.033
let alone be the president.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.416
Amy, there's no safer place
to stick Jonah Ryan

28:35.505 --> 28:37.417
in all of Washington, D.C.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.921
Being vice president
is like being declawed,

28:41.011 --> 28:43.378
defanged, neutered,

28:43.472 --> 28:47.341
ball-gagged, and sealed
in an abandoned coal mine

28:47.434 --> 28:51.018
under two miles of human shit!

28:51.104 --> 28:54.188
It is a fate worse than death.

28:54.274 --> 28:58.359
Besides, I'm not gonna die,
'cause I got the heart and the twat

28:58.445 --> 29:01.688
of a high school cheerleader
who's only done anal!

29:02.282 --> 29:04.990
- I am begging you, please...
- Ma'am, entreating,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.757
- supplicating, beseeching...
- Think of...

29:06.828 --> 29:09.070
Enough!

29:09.706 --> 29:11.743
I didn't come to North Carolina
to lose.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.916
I don't even like
to change planes here.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.745
Jonah Ryan is gonna be
the vice president. You got it?

29:16.838 --> 29:18.398
And that's final.
So, get off your knees

29:18.465 --> 29:22.004
and cut out this
melodramatic bullshit!

29:22.094 --> 29:23.094
Let's go.

29:25.931 --> 29:29.174
- What's the rush?
- Oh, hey! You're my guy!

29:31.812 --> 29:33.974
Okay, so, I think
we know why we are here.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.064
Yes, ma'am.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.980
- Yes, we do.
- I don't know why we are here.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.855
Me, neither.
But I love meeting new people.

29:39.945 --> 29:44.406
She is offering you vice president,
you monument to vaginal dryness.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.286
Well, then, no.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.206
I'm sorry?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.074
I said no. As in never.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.748
I will be president,
or I will be nothing.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.080
And in fact,
if I don't get the nomination,

30:00.173 --> 30:03.257
I might run as a third party
just to fuck your shit up.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.802
Shut the fuck up,
you gum-recessed face-anus!

30:06.888 --> 30:10.006
Don't you see you've just been offered
the second-most powerful job

30:10.100 --> 30:11.216
in the world?

30:11.310 --> 30:13.302
No, you shut up, Uncle Jeff!

30:13.395 --> 30:16.138
I will not let anyone
speak to me like that.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.938
- President or nothing?
- Yeah!

30:18.400 --> 30:19.766
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Ow!

30:19.860 --> 30:21.852
You cockless cockroach!

30:21.945 --> 30:24.483
You pile of failure
shaped like a rapist!

30:24.573 --> 30:26.860
I am not shaped like a rapist!

30:26.950 --> 30:29.613
I'm gonna hit you with my car,
like I did in kindergarten!

30:29.703 --> 30:31.740
...figure out what the fuck you were!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.162
...with purpose and repetition!

30:33.248 --> 30:35.285
Okay, fine! Jesus fuckin' Christ,

30:35.375 --> 30:38.083
I'll be vice president,
just stop yelling at me!

30:38.170 --> 30:40.628
- All right, fine.
- Crisis is now averted.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.706
- No. I have one condition.
- Oh, shit.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.337
- I want my best friend Richard...
- No, and your only friend.

30:45.427 --> 30:48.795
I want Richard to be
Secretary of farm shit.

30:48.889 --> 30:51.034
- We're gonna have to fire Dan.
- We'll have to fire Dan.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.344
Why do you want to fire him?

30:52.434 --> 30:56.053
Uh, just as a way of saying sorry
for yelling at you earlier.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.887
You know, feminism.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.722
That sounds great. Fire Dan. He sucks.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.808
Mazel tov, Selina, mazel tov.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.880
- Oh, thank you, Sherman.
- Listen, when you have a sec,

31:03.904 --> 31:05.089
I want to talk to you about one of

31:05.113 --> 31:06.424
the biggest challenges
facing the country

31:06.448 --> 31:08.259
- in the 21st century.
- Okay, sure. Tell me right now.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.240
Casino licenses in Macao.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.596
Oh, and... Did you hear that, Keith?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.077
- I did.
- How could you?

31:13.163 --> 31:15.746
- Okay, Macao.
- Tell me that it is not true.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.245
Catherine, I'm right
in the middle of something.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.998
Tell me that you did not
just trade away same-sex marriage...

31:21.088 --> 31:22.982
Can you believe I'm having
to deal with this right now?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.793
...to get Buddy Calhoun's endorsement!

31:24.883 --> 31:27.591
Catherine, it is just
the party platform.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.795
It's like a to-do list of things
we're not gonna do.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.505
"Restore faith in democracy?"

31:32.599 --> 31:35.307
I mean, we couldn't do that
even if we wanted to.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.808
You cannot do this.
I will never forgive you.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.981
Oh, well, if I had a dollar for every
"Mother, I will never forgive you..."

31:42.067 --> 31:43.683
- Bazillionaire.
- Correct.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.690
Now, listen, Mommy's got a lot of work
to do right now, sweetie.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.113
I have to write the press release
for my VP pick, so.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.815
- There you go.
- Thank you very much.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.993
- Why is Jonah helping you?
- Started from the bottom, now we here.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.250
- Oh, my God.
- Are you out of your fucking mind,

32:00.335 --> 32:01.667
Gram-Ma'am?

32:01.753 --> 32:04.040
No. Oh, my God. Okay.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.963
I will never forgive you for this!

32:06.049 --> 32:07.585
- Mmm? Yep.
- Ka-ching.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.796
I'm sorry about that, folks.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.756
Awesome. Cheers, ma'am.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.298
And on this history-making
11th ballot, Jane,

32:14.391 --> 32:17.884
it looks like the convention
will finally have its nominee.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.095
...great State of North Carolina,

32:20.188 --> 32:24.023
the home of historically black
Fayetteville State University,

32:24.109 --> 32:27.227
and historically white
Duke University,

32:27.320 --> 32:30.438
would like to yield
to the great State of Maryland!

32:30.532 --> 32:32.649
Mr. Chairman, I move

32:32.742 --> 32:36.281
that Selina Meyer
be selected by this convention

32:36.371 --> 32:40.115
by acclimation as our nominee

32:40.208 --> 32:43.121
for President of the United States!

32:43.295 --> 32:47.255
All those in favor
of nominating President Selina Meyer

32:47.340 --> 32:51.084
- by acclimation, say aye!
- Aye!

32:51.178 --> 32:52.780
- All opposed, please say no!
- No!

32:52.804 --> 32:54.887
The measure is adopted!

32:56.850 --> 32:57.966
We did it!

33:03.190 --> 33:04.647
<i>I was three years old</i>

33:04.733 --> 33:07.441
<i>the first time my father
put me on a horse,</i>

33:07.527 --> 33:10.065
<i>and I fell right off.</i>

33:14.117 --> 33:17.030
<i>They say experience
is the best teacher,</i>

33:17.120 --> 33:20.329
<i>and although my own daughter
never learned to ride well,</i>

33:20.415 --> 33:22.907
<i>I've made it my mission in life
to teach...</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:25.334
I waited a long time for this.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.878
Yeah, but this Meyer Fund thing
isn't going away.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.627
It's stickier than
a red wine-and-curry dump.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.042
- We can't have a damaged nominee.
- I know.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.923
Somebody's gonna go down
for this, Selina.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.221
Like myself on any
traveling German businessman

33:37.307 --> 33:39.368
- at a Dubuque Radisson breakfast...
- Not now, Will!

33:39.392 --> 33:40.883
Read the room.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.617
Somebody's gotta
go down for this, Selina.

33:42.646 --> 33:45.104
I just said I know, Roger.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.941
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Look who I found.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.643
Oh, hey, John.

33:50.737 --> 33:55.277
Oh, yeah, so, I'm gonna take
two more lines from your speech, okay?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.367
Here, okay?

33:56.451 --> 33:59.068
That's about me waking up
in a hospital bed in Kabul

33:59.162 --> 34:01.825
- after the IED attack.
- I'm... I'm gonna tweak it.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.373
And I'm sorry about
the whole vice presidency thing,

34:04.459 --> 34:05.950
but I knew you'd understand.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.960
Oh, so, you'll probably
want to cut the line

34:09.047 --> 34:12.210
about you being
the vice president. Right?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.292
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.551
<i>...and pass it on to
the next generation in spades.</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:21.849
<i>Over the years I may
have been thrown off a few times,</i>

34:21.935 --> 34:26.020
<i>but like my daddy taught me,
you always get right back on,</i>

34:26.106 --> 34:28.893
<i>like America.</i>

34:29.025 --> 34:32.438
And now, to introduce
our party's nominee...

34:33.362 --> 34:35.650
Right. Break a leg.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.732
...John DeVito of Ohio!

34:39.452 --> 34:40.943
Come on, come on.

34:42.746 --> 34:43.746
It'd be faster

34:43.831 --> 34:45.197
- just to lay down and roll.
- Eh.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.079
Hello. I'm John DeVito.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.000
And like the soldiers I served with,

34:49.087 --> 34:52.545
I'm here to talk tonight about a woman
who always keeps her word.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.272
All right.
Are you ready for the Dubonnet?

34:55.342 --> 34:57.050
- Hey, Gary?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.719
I need you to do something for me.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.525
Yeah, yeah.
You got something in your teeth.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.048
- Hold on. Just one second.
- Sorry.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.885
Anyway, listen,
it's kind of important, actually,

35:04.978 --> 35:06.765
- and I would also say...
- Okay, yeah.

35:07.147 --> 35:09.730
- That it's not easy...
- Okay.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.978
And it's kinda also not fair.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.402
You want coffee
from across the street? Yeah?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.447
Ah! I got it. Little chia seed.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.742
Nah. Never mind.
Forget I ever said anything.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.697
- You look beautiful.
- And you are a lifesaver.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.906
Oh. Oh, come on.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.663
Yeah. I couldn't have
done it without you.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.370
You don't have to worry,
I'm not going anywhere.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.358
...the next President
of the United States of America,

35:34.382 --> 35:36.248
Selina Meyer!

35:44.684 --> 35:45.925
Thank you!

35:46.936 --> 35:48.643
Thank you!

35:48.730 --> 35:51.097
I am Selina Meyer,

35:51.191 --> 35:55.231
and I proudly accept your nomination

35:55.320 --> 35:59.405
for President of the
United States of America!

36:02.369 --> 36:03.780
Even if it took a while!

36:05.872 --> 36:08.364
The journey that we begin tonight

36:08.458 --> 36:11.417
has been many,
many years in the making,

36:11.503 --> 36:14.462
<i>and it all started in Kabul.</i>

36:15.465 --> 36:18.253
<i>Waking up in a</i>

36:18.343 --> 36:19.834
<i>hotel bed...</i>

36:20.178 --> 36:21.760
That DeVito's
a hell of a speechwriter.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.133
Good evening, Mr. Cafferty!

36:24.224 --> 36:26.136
You ready for your sponge bath?

36:26.226 --> 36:28.138
Ah, call me Ben.

36:28.228 --> 36:32.814
...to make the world a safer,
cleaner, better place!

36:32.899 --> 36:34.106
Yeah!

36:34.192 --> 36:36.104
So? What did we get?

36:36.194 --> 36:39.187
President Meyer offered me
Secretary of Agriculture.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.653
Yes, Richard!
Secretary of Swag-riculture!

36:42.742 --> 36:46.406
Oh, my God. Yes!
I'm goin' back to Washington, baby!

36:46.496 --> 36:48.579
- But...
- No! No "buts," Richard.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.203
Okay? For once in your life,
don't think so much, just say yes.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.124
- Yes.
- Good man.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.624
But the "but" was,
"But you have to fire Dan."

36:55.714 --> 36:58.172
- So, I guess you're fired.
- What?

36:58.258 --> 36:59.669
Thanks for making this easy on me.

37:01.136 --> 37:02.422
I gotta get out of politics.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.782
To be honest, I never thought you were
really cut out for it, anyway.

37:04.806 --> 37:09.176
Finally, I wanted to say
a word about sacrifice.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.137
It means to lose something

37:13.606 --> 37:15.438
for the greater good.

37:15.525 --> 37:19.235
And when I look back
on my 52 years,

37:19.320 --> 37:23.690
with almost 30 of them
spent in public service...

37:23.783 --> 37:27.697
- What's going on?
- ...there is no one who has sacrificed

37:27.787 --> 37:29.995
more than me.

37:33.585 --> 37:38.421
And there's nothing
anyone can do to stop me

37:38.506 --> 37:42.876
from standing and walking
for my country!

37:42.969 --> 37:47.134
Thank you, and God bless America!

37:54.981 --> 37:57.018
Oh, God.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.225
We got this.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.276
- We did it. We did it.
- Yes.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.752
Wonderful!

38:32.560 --> 38:35.052
- Congratulations, ma'am.
- Thank you!

38:35.146 --> 38:36.586
We're going back to the White House!

38:36.648 --> 38:39.231
- Congratulations to you, Amy!
- Thank you!

38:39.317 --> 38:42.025
You're gonna be Jonah's
chief of staff.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.272
Huh?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.966
I don't like the way you talked to me
the other day.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.231
Uh-huh.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.991
Yeah. Yeah.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.320
<i>Yes!</i>

38:55.583 --> 38:57.199
<i>He's a super Veep</i>

38:57.293 --> 38:59.159
<i>Super Veep, he's super Veepy</i>

38:59.254 --> 39:00.335
<i>Yow!</i>

39:00.421 --> 39:01.582
Hi, Sue.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.777
Sue, the Vice President would like
a minute with the President.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.340
The President told me to pencil you in
to half past go-fuck-yourself.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.967
- Sue, when I am President...
- You won't be.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.576
- If you want to work for me...
- I don't.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.308
Then I would start treating me
with the respect that I deserve.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.182
- I am.
- Sue, as Vice President

39:17.272 --> 39:21.016
of the United States, I order you
to let me into the Oval Office!

39:22.652 --> 39:24.143
God damn it!

39:25.613 --> 39:27.758
- I'm just gonna pop my head in.
- Nice to see you, Amy.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.054
Ma'am, Joint Chiefs
are getting a little squirrely

39:32.078 --> 39:34.411
about Chinese tank movements
near the Tibetan border.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.937
Oh, my God. What a bunch of pussies.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.602
Ma'am, we're expecting a call
from the Israeli prime minister

39:38.626 --> 39:40.208
about the Palestinian food riots.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.412
That reminds me, I'm starving. Gary!

39:42.547 --> 39:44.584
Oh, ma'am, Gary doesn't work here.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.652
I know. Why are you telling me things
that I already know?

39:46.676 --> 39:48.087
- Sorry. Yes.
- You know?

39:48.177 --> 39:49.321
But I would be more than happy

39:49.345 --> 39:50.906
to get you something to eat.
What would you like?

39:50.930 --> 39:52.216
- You figure that out.
- Okay.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.048
Why am I coming up
with solutions for you?

39:54.142 --> 39:55.661
That's your job, right?
That's not my job.

39:55.685 --> 39:56.801
Sorry, ma'am.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.354
The level of incompetence
in this office is just...

40:12.952 --> 40:15.695
<i>Ma'am, the Israeli prime minister
is on line three.</i>

40:16.956 --> 40:19.824
David? Shalom.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.501
So, what did the Palestinians
do this time?

40:22.837 --> 40:24.749
David, I have to tell you,
my daughter Catherine

40:24.839 --> 40:28.048
was exactly the same way,
a whiner. Yeah...

40:28.676 --> 40:30.463
Yeah. Mmm-hmm. What?

40:30.553 --> 40:32.072
This is your speech
for this afternoon.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.382
Glasses.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.263
Jesus Christ.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.216
No, no. Not you, David.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.801
Yes.

40:38.895 --> 40:43.640
Well, tell me,
how can the United States help you?

40:52.617 --> 40:54.950
Good afternoon, I'm Michael McLintock,

40:55.036 --> 40:57.699
with live coverage of
the funeral of Selina Meyer,

40:57.789 --> 40:59.906
America's first woman president.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.582
While she may have only served
one full term,

41:02.669 --> 41:04.410
Meyer is fondly remembered

41:04.504 --> 41:08.123
for briefly freeing what was once
known as the nation of Tibet,

41:08.216 --> 41:11.800
as well as for permanently
overturning same-sex marriage.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.503
<i>The former president
passed away earlier this week</i>

41:14.597 --> 41:17.510
<i>at the age of 76 or possibly 77</i>

41:17.600 --> 41:19.683
or, according to some sources, 75.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.726
<i>After lying in state in the Capitol,</i>

41:21.813 --> 41:24.806
<i>her casket made the journey
to her final resting place</i>

41:24.899 --> 41:26.891
<i>the Selina Meyer Presidential Library</i>

41:26.985 --> 41:29.693
<i>at Smith College
in Northampton, Massachusetts.</i>

41:32.323 --> 41:35.361
<i>Among the dignitaries
personally selected by Selina Meyer</i>

41:35.451 --> 41:38.364
<i>to sit in the front row
are many former rivals</i>

41:38.454 --> 41:42.243
<i>in a Meyer-esque gesture
of grace and goodwill.</i>

41:43.084 --> 41:45.918
<i>Former President Laura Montez,
the Dalai Lama,</i>

41:46.004 --> 41:47.791
<i>former Vice President Andrew Doyle,</i>

41:47.880 --> 41:51.499
<i>former two-term President Kemi Talbot,
who will deliver her eulogy...</i>

41:51.759 --> 41:53.967
How does Mike
have more hair than I do?

41:54.053 --> 41:55.760
Maybe because he has two testicles.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.687
Oh, Montez looks good.
I'd still do her.

41:57.724 --> 41:58.805
Count me in.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.869
I didn't want to go
to that stupid funeral, anyway.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.933
Well, then it's a good thing
that you got impeached,

42:03.021 --> 42:04.248
they didn't have to invite you.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.582
Catherine, you're missing it!

42:05.606 --> 42:06.606
Coming!

42:06.691 --> 42:08.774
You know, Richard,
there are few things in life

42:08.860 --> 42:10.567
more difficult
than the loss of a parent.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.111
Who wants margaritas?

42:13.239 --> 42:15.276
- Over here.
- What did I miss?

42:15.366 --> 42:17.153
<i>The Presidential motorcade
has arrived,</i>

42:17.243 --> 42:19.576
<i>and here comes
President of the United States</i>

42:19.662 --> 42:23.201
<i>Richard Splett and the First Lady,
Annette Splett, somber but elegant,</i>

42:23.291 --> 42:26.159
<i>basking in the glow
of a landslide re-election</i>

42:26.252 --> 42:29.416
<i>following President Splett's
historic three-state solution</i>

42:29.505 --> 42:31.041
<i>Middle East peace agreement,</i>

42:31.132 --> 42:34.045
<i>for which he won the Nobel Prize.</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:39.258
Amen.

42:40.141 --> 42:43.555
We have 40 head of alpaca now,
17 on the way.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.226
My daughter's stepping down from NASA

42:45.313 --> 42:48.681
to take over the ranch,
so, I can focus on my watch-making.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.188
We didn't have kids.
Best decision we ever made.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.609
Best. Best.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.778
Our greyhounds are our kids.

42:54.864 --> 42:57.072
Kent, do you still
keep in touch with Ben's widow?

42:57.158 --> 42:58.444
- I forget her name.
- No.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.775
Betcha Ben did, too.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.577
Amazing he hung on
as long as he did, the fat fuck.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.700
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

43:04.791 --> 43:07.329
- How long's it been, Ames?
- Dan.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.456
I think the last time I saw you,
your wife was being born.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.957
2019, yeah.

43:12.048 --> 43:13.048
Oh! And by the way,

43:13.132 --> 43:15.840
if you guys ever want to buy
or sell a piece of property

43:15.927 --> 43:18.030
in the Laguna Beach area,
I'm your guy. That's my cell.

43:18.054 --> 43:21.172
Look at you losers waitin' around
to make sure she's actually dead,

43:21.265 --> 43:22.597
while you sit in the back row

43:22.683 --> 43:24.640
suckin' on hard candies
like what, Will?

43:26.312 --> 43:27.519
I like jizz.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.813
Ah, shit. He ain't what he used to be.

43:30.358 --> 43:33.817
Holy shit. Ames. Check it out.

43:33.903 --> 43:36.520
I didn't think he'd show.

43:36.656 --> 43:40.115
- I heard she never visited him.
- Just keep walking.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.615
You'd hate the flowers.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.991
But I...

43:51.420 --> 43:53.286
I brought the Dubonnet.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.836
<i>And it looks like the soldiers
are having a little trouble.</i>

44:13.860 --> 44:15.003
<i>They're fumbling around the crypt,</i>

44:15.027 --> 44:17.565
<i>but they cannot seem to get it
to respond in any way.</i>

44:17.655 --> 44:19.271
Typical.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.659
<i>But now, they've got it.</i>

44:28.749 --> 44:31.833
<i>And there she goes,
sliding right in there.</i>

44:31.919 --> 44:35.253
<i>We will have more coverage of the
funeral of President Selina Meyer.</i>

44:35.339 --> 44:39.208
<i>But first, as someone who served with
President Meyer for over two decades,</i>

44:39.302 --> 44:43.296
<i>I feel I'd be remiss if I did not
offer my own heartfelt eulogy</i>

44:43.389 --> 44:47.554
<i>to a president who many feel
was very underrated and deserved...</i>

44:48.811 --> 44:50.552
<i>I'm sorry. Breaking news.</i>

44:50.646 --> 44:52.182
<i>I've just been told</i>

44:52.273 --> 44:55.732
<i>that four-time Academy Award-winning
actor Tom Hanks</i>

44:55.902 --> 44:57.814
<i>has died at the age of 88.</i>

44:57.904 --> 45:00.863
<i>The star of such Hollywood
films as</i> Big, Forrest Gump,

45:00.948 --> 45:03.281
Philadelphia <i>and</i> Philadelphia 2,

45:03.367 --> 45:06.451
<i>passed away in his Bel Air home
after a long illness,</i>

45:06.537 --> 45:08.620
<i>surrounded by his loving family.</i>

45:08.706 --> 45:11.164
<i>Husband of actress Rita Wilson
and father of four children,</i>

45:11.250 --> 45:15.415
<i>Hanks was often considered
the finest actor of his generation,</i>

45:15.504 --> 45:17.791
<i>an American everyman
who could leap effortlessly</i>

45:17.882 --> 45:19.794
<i>between comedy and drama,</i>

45:19.884 --> 45:22.592

both young and old.</i>
