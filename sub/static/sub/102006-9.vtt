scheduling some overnight visits

02:36.306 --> 02:37.898
for Nia and her mother.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.993
HEN:
Yes. We need to talk.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.144
We want to meet her.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.146
We want to meet
Nia's birth mother.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.724
Ms. Wilson,
you know we can't do that.

02:47.743 --> 02:48.983
Why not?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.244
We need to make sure
Nia's safe, right?

02:51.397 --> 02:53.154
-Mm-hmm.
-That's the job you gave us...

02:53.248 --> 02:54.898
-Mm-hmm.
-...as foster parents.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.733
I-I want to do my job.

02:56.752 --> 02:58.159
It's the state's job,

02:58.253 --> 03:00.828
and this is about reunification.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.382
These last few visits
were about rebuilding

03:04.535 --> 03:09.563
a bond and a trust between
Nia and her biological mother.

03:12.267 --> 03:16.028
Well, isn't there anything
you can tell us about her?

03:16.179 --> 03:18.513
Nothing beyond the fact
that she's demonstrated

03:18.532 --> 03:21.925
her ability to give Nia
a safe and stable home.

03:21.944 --> 03:24.185
Demonstrate how?

03:24.279 --> 03:27.021
We-we don't even know what she
did wrong in the first place.

03:27.115 --> 03:29.190
What-what, was it, was it drugs?

03:29.210 --> 03:30.934
Was she abusive?
Neglectful? What?

03:30.953 --> 03:34.880
Look, it is not uncommon for
foster parents to feel this way.

03:35.031 --> 03:38.032
I mean, Nia has been with you
a long time.

03:38.126 --> 03:40.034
Longer than we expected.

03:40.128 --> 03:42.462
And the pandemic made it longer.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.871
What are our options?

03:43.966 --> 03:46.040
-For?
-For protecting Nia.

03:46.134 --> 03:47.726
HEN:
Our legal options.

03:47.877 --> 03:49.119
Can we adopt her?

03:49.137 --> 03:51.879
DEIDRA:
Let me just stop you right here.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.291
You've done a-an amazing job
with Nia.

03:54.384 --> 03:56.902
I wish I had a dozen more
foster families like you.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.904
But the reunification of a child

03:59.055 --> 04:02.315
and their birth parent
is our main goal.

04:02.468 --> 04:05.135
What if that birth parent
is still unfit?

04:05.153 --> 04:07.061
DEIDRA: You have to trust us.
We wouldn't have started

04:07.081 --> 04:09.973
this process if we thought
her mother wasn't ready.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.750
And even after she regains
physical custody,

04:11.901 --> 04:13.234
we don't just walk away.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.570
There'll be follow-up visits,
check-ins.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.756
We will make sure she's safe.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.242
Come back inside
when you're ready.

04:21.336 --> 04:24.321
And Carly will bring Nia
out after her visit.

04:24.414 --> 04:28.058
And today,
she goes home with you.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.259
Hen? You need to calm down.

04:38.353 --> 04:41.171
T-They're tearing
our family apart, Karen.

04:41.189 --> 04:43.615
H-How can I stay calm?
How can you be calm?

04:43.767 --> 04:45.617
Because this is the job.

04:45.769 --> 04:47.435
It's what we signed up for.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.289
-We knew, we...
-I didn't know it would,
it would feel like this.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.458
We were supposed to foster her
for-for a few months.

04:53.685 --> 04:57.704
It's been almost a year, Karen.
She's our daughter now.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.464
I know.

04:59.691 --> 05:02.384
-I know this is hard...
-No, it's not hard.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.013
It's wrong.

05:13.630 --> 05:16.565

05:25.217 --> 05:26.716
MAY:
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't,

05:26.810 --> 05:29.310
-I didn't see you there.
-I'd say we need
a traffic light there,

05:29.330 --> 05:32.039
but I'm pretty sure you'd have
barreled through that, too.

05:33.559 --> 05:35.909
Hey. Are you okay?

05:36.061 --> 05:38.078
MAY:
Um, yeah. I guess.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.397
I just got this friend request
from someone

05:40.415 --> 05:41.823
I used to go
to high school with.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.233
Just kind of caught me
by surprise.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.510
JOSH:
Ah, a whole seven months ago.

05:45.737 --> 05:46.903
How the time flies.

05:46.996 --> 05:48.496
MAY: She transferred out
a few years back.

05:48.590 --> 05:54.311
After bullying me and making
my life a living hell.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.265
JOSH:
You want me to respond to her?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.601
I'm sure I could think
of a few choice ideas

06:01.753 --> 06:03.862
-of where she can stick
her friend request.
-Hey, it-it's okay.

06:04.013 --> 06:06.013
Just... I think
I'm gonna ignore it.

06:06.108 --> 06:09.092
You know,
it's-it's been three years.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.370
Doesn't really matter
what she has to say anymore.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.210
LINDA:
You sure you should be
working nights

06:18.437 --> 06:20.361
-when you're that pregnant?
-Oh, I figured staying up

06:20.381 --> 06:22.214
all night would be good practice
for all the hours

06:22.441 --> 06:24.290
I'm gonna be keeping
when the baby's born.

06:24.443 --> 06:25.959
Well, you make me feel
like I should be calling OSHA

06:26.111 --> 06:27.961
to report a labor violation.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.888
(strains):
Ooh. Don't say that word.

06:30.039 --> 06:32.391

having contractions?

06:32.542 --> 06:33.633
Constantly.

06:33.785 --> 06:34.893
But not real ones.

06:35.044 --> 06:36.377
Braxton Hicks.
I've been having them all week,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.546
and every time I think
something's gonna happen...

06:38.565 --> 06:39.714
-nothing.
-Ooh.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.974
An emotional roller coaster.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.884
Well, that would
explain the nausea.

LINDA:
Yeah, you might want to "D" that
a little faster.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.316
When my mother went
to the hospital to have

07:06.334 --> 07:07.834
my little brother, she didn't
have a name picked out, either.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.594
Then she got all caught up
in the emotion,

07:09.746 --> 07:11.430
named him after the nice doctor.

07:11.581 --> 07:13.840
And my brother has been living
his entire life regretting it.

07:13.992 --> 07:15.675
Oh, my God.

07:32.268 --> 07:35.787
Uh, I thought you were just
gonna put names in a hat.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.998
Yeah.

07:38.700 --> 07:42.852
Okay, here we go.

07:42.946 --> 07:46.548
"I really don't want to pick
our baby's name this way."

07:48.360 --> 07:50.760
Okay, but that's never gonna fit
on her driver's license.

Maddie. Maddie!

Shannon and I didn't know what

a psycho.

supposed to test your patience,

she'd at least wait

08:20.058 --> 08:21.148
until she was out of the womb.

08:21.243 --> 08:22.575
Well, at least,
you'll be well-prepared

08:22.669 --> 08:24.077
-for her arrival.
-Oh, we are.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.988
Baby toys, clothes,
towels, blankets, supplements.

hospital food that much?

08:30.511 --> 08:31.676
Hey, Wilson!

08:31.828 --> 08:33.069
Could use a hand here.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.739
No, in case the hospital
loses power.

08:35.757 --> 08:37.240
Ah.

08:37.259 --> 08:39.834
Didn't we just restock
the ambulance?

08:39.928 --> 08:41.002
Well, yeah,
but there's no such thing

08:41.096 --> 08:43.004

08:43.098 --> 08:45.673

any rhyme or reason

08:45.692 --> 08:48.318

Good luck.

20:16.107 --> 20:19.199
Word of advice?
If she tells you to shut up,

20:19.293 --> 20:20.033
shut up.

20:20.127 --> 20:22.053
-Copy that.

No, no, no, no.
I-I don't understand.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.206

I can't see her?

20:26.226 --> 20:28.559
-She's here, right?
-Yes, your wife is here,

20:28.711 --> 20:31.044
but as I explained already,
her room is currently listed

20:31.064 --> 20:32.396
-as secured.
-Secured?

20:32.548 --> 20:34.214
-What does that even mean?
-Everything okay here?

20:34.234 --> 20:36.567
Uh, this gentleman is here
to see Rachel Hawkerson.

20:36.794 --> 20:39.311
She's my wife.
I got a call that she and my son

20:39.405 --> 20:40.738
were in some kind of accident,

20:40.965 --> 20:42.389
but nobody will tell me
anything, except that my son

20:42.408 --> 20:44.891
is at a different hospital
and I can't see my wife.

20:44.911 --> 20:49.638
Sir, they were part of the
collision on the 710 freeway.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.749
The-the big pileup?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.142
Yes.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.402
Can we go somewhere quiet
where we can talk?

20:55.496 --> 20:58.405
-I want to see my wife.
-I'm afraid you can't do that
right now.

20:58.499 --> 21:01.408
Your wife's room is secure
because she's in our custody

21:01.502 --> 21:05.504

of tonight's accident.

21:05.656 --> 21:07.348

21:17.852 --> 21:20.503
they said it was a drunk driver.

21:20.596 --> 21:22.530
ATHENA:
Yes.

21:23.932 --> 21:26.117
No.

21:26.769 --> 21:28.327
No.

21:29.104 --> 21:31.622
She wouldn't do that.

21:31.774 --> 21:35.108
Not with Jacob in the car.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.128
She promised me.

21:37.279 --> 21:41.173
Sometimes,
we break our promises.

21:44.879 --> 21:46.028
Okay.

21:46.121 --> 21:48.431
Yes. Uh, thank you.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.350
How's your son?

21:53.796 --> 21:55.704
He's still in surgery.

21:55.723 --> 21:57.631
I, uh...

21:57.650 --> 21:59.650
I need to get over there.

21:59.877 --> 22:01.527
I can have an officer take you.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.991
Did she say anything?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.309
Rachel? At the scene?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.996
She wasn't really coherent.

22:14.483 --> 22:17.043
You didn't know
she was drinking?

22:18.229 --> 22:21.422
I thought all this
was behind us.

22:22.491 --> 22:23.323
She tried

22:23.343 --> 22:26.752
so many times to stay sober.

22:26.904 --> 22:29.972
It almost broke our marriage.

22:30.925 --> 22:32.516
But then...

22:32.668 --> 22:35.019
then Jacob.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.272
And I thought...

22:39.525 --> 22:40.841
I thought, "Finally,

22:40.935 --> 22:43.444
she'll have a reason
not to drink."

22:45.347 --> 22:47.365
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell him.

22:48.350 --> 22:51.202
Is there... Is there any way
you're wrong about this?

22:51.353 --> 22:55.539
She had a BAC of .28
when she arrived.

22:55.766 --> 22:58.292
Four times the legal limit.

22:59.453 --> 23:01.879
Probably higher
at the time of the crash.

23:02.030 --> 23:04.607
That would account
for her disorientation

23:04.700 --> 23:07.093
from your son's 911 call.

23:09.389 --> 23:12.973
(voice breaking):
Jacob's the one who called 911?

23:14.635 --> 23:16.394

23:16.621 --> 23:18.396

Today of all days.

31:24.791 --> 31:26.625
Well, luckily, we don't have to.

31:26.777 --> 31:27.867

Morning. Whatever.

32:43.187 --> 32:45.445
and you just write it off
like it happens every day.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.040
And the social worker tells us
there's nothing we could do,

32:49.193 --> 32:51.343

32:53.288 --> 32:56.264

41:41.074 --> 41:42.815
