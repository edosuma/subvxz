WEBVTT

00:03.954 --> 00:06.605
Isn't this Better Earth Caf
fantastic?

00:06.640 --> 00:07.892
Finally, a place where I
don't have to apologize

00:07.916 --> 00:09.499
for being a vegetarian.

00:09.534 --> 00:12.419
But I do have to apologize for
not bringing my wallet.

00:12.454 --> 00:15.346
You're paying.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.658
So I'm not going to enjoy it,
and I have to pick up the tab?

00:18.693 --> 00:21.186
This is my last date
all over again.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.163
This place is so fresh,

00:23.198 --> 00:24.706
you can literally
smell the farm.

00:24.742 --> 00:26.283
( Inhales deeply )

00:26.318 --> 00:28.110
Okay, scratch that.

00:28.145 --> 00:31.137
We're just really close
to the bathroom.

00:31.173 --> 00:34.466
( Whining ) Where's our food?
I'm hungry.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.518
Marisa, if you can't wait,
just eat the cup.

00:36.553 --> 00:39.980
It's made out of seaweed.

00:40.015 --> 00:41.973
All right, here ya go.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.575
A feed the earth
mega-vegan burrito,

00:43.610 --> 00:45.477
and a meatless double
one world burger!

00:45.513 --> 00:47.771
Wait, wait, wait.

00:47.806 --> 00:49.242
Shouldn't the double
one world burger

00:49.266 --> 00:51.558
just be called
a two world burger?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.126
( Raucous laughter )

00:55.347 --> 00:56.855
A two world burger.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.798
That's a great one.

00:58.834 --> 00:59.936
Hey, Jake, you gotta hear this.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.144
( Chuckling )

01:02.146 --> 01:06.390
Oh. Oh, I think Better Earth
needs a better chef.

01:06.425 --> 01:08.383
Well, I like it.

01:08.419 --> 01:10.360
Plus, they're giving
great jobs to teenagers.

01:10.395 --> 01:11.728
Speaking of which, excuse me.

01:11.764 --> 01:14.122
Is Danielle working today?

01:14.158 --> 01:16.058
Danielle is at
our training facility.

01:16.093 --> 01:17.229
She's been promoted to manager.

01:17.253 --> 01:19.102
Hm, that's weird,

01:19.137 --> 01:21.145
because I just saw her
yesterday,

01:21.181 --> 01:21.955
and she didn't mention
anything about that.

01:21.990 --> 01:24.249
Must've happened after you left.

01:24.326 --> 01:27.009
You mean, after she
closed up, locked the door,

01:27.045 --> 01:28.703
and then gave me a ride home?

01:30.357 --> 01:32.891
Okay.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.993
Well, you know what?
Tell her I said congrats.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.503
We're no longer
in communication.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.557
Have a nice day.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.918
And don't forget to make
the world a better place.

01:42.953 --> 01:44.970
That's a lot of pressure.

01:47.632 --> 01:50.316
No longer in communication?
Something's weird here.

01:50.352 --> 01:52.502
Oh, I agree.

01:52.537 --> 01:54.045
Yeah, and I'm holding it
in my hand.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.689
Just eat your cup.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.607
( Crunching )

01:57.642 --> 01:58.650
Oh.

02:01.212 --> 02:04.723
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:04.758 --> 02:07.876
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:07.878 --> 02:11.830
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:11.865 --> 02:15.850
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:15.886 --> 02:19.554
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:19.589 --> 02:21.648
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:21.684 --> 02:25.719
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:25.754 --> 02:29.656
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:29.692 --> 02:31.766
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:31.801 --> 02:34.044
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:34.079 --> 02:36.229
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:36.265 --> 02:38.340
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:38.375 --> 02:40.142
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:40.177 --> 02:42.427
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:42.462 --> 02:45.022
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:45.057 --> 02:46.456
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:46.491 --> 02:48.775
I keep it undercover.

02:48.810 --> 02:49.810
I keep it undercover.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.600
Great. Suddenly, Danielle
is management material.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.743
I like the girl, I do,

02:58.779 --> 03:00.771
but she couldn't even
make change for a five.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.355
Five ones, Danielle.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.100
Five ones.

03:05.135 --> 03:07.895
And then I called
the corporate office,

03:07.971 --> 03:09.891
and they said that they've
never even heard of her.

03:09.915 --> 03:12.732
This place may be vegan,
but it smells fishy.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.284
KC, you are absolutely...

03:14.319 --> 03:16.398
Ridiculous. I know. Everything
I'm saying is ridiculous.

03:16.422 --> 03:20.299
No, I was gonna say I think
your instincts are right.

03:20.334 --> 03:25.454
There's something shady about
these health food cafs.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.723
Their sole purpose seems to be
to recruit members

03:28.758 --> 03:30.784
into an organization called
the Volunteens.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.011
The Volunteens?

03:33.047 --> 03:35.022
That sounds like the worst
boy band name ever.

03:35.057 --> 03:38.583
I've heard worse. What
exactly is a Backstreet Boy?

03:41.196 --> 03:43.813
Anyway, the Volunteens'
charismatic founder

03:43.849 --> 03:46.466
is 20-year-old Jane Keller.

03:46.501 --> 03:47.954
She owns all 60 of
the Better Earth cafs

03:47.978 --> 03:50.103
across the country.

03:50.138 --> 03:53.665
Wow. I don't own 60 of anything.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.985
No. Flannel shirts.

03:57.020 --> 03:59.588
I own 60 flannel shirts.

03:59.623 --> 04:02.073
I'll keep that in mind
in case we need anybody

04:02.108 --> 04:03.859
to go undercover
as a lumberjack.

04:03.894 --> 04:06.269
But right now,

04:06.305 --> 04:09.039
we need to find out
what Keller is up to,

04:09.074 --> 04:11.207
so I want you and Ernie
to go undercover

04:11.242 --> 04:12.934
working at Better Earth,

04:12.969 --> 04:15.378
and get recruited by
the Volunteens.

04:15.413 --> 04:16.705
Okay, yeah. For sure.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.584
Oh, uh, you got
a little something...

04:21.619 --> 04:24.462
( clears throat )
all in this general area.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.068
CRAIG: Oh, yes.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.179
Truffles?

04:33.214 --> 04:35.974
You shelled out the big bucks
for a stinky mushroom,

04:36.009 --> 04:38.101
but you won't let us run
the A/C past 6:00?

04:38.136 --> 04:40.612
Look here, when you grow up
and get your own house,

04:40.647 --> 04:42.639
you can make the rules.

04:42.674 --> 04:45.683
I'm a robot; I'll never grow up.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.759
Then I guess we'll have to
keep doing things my way.

04:49.113 --> 04:51.081
For your information,

04:51.116 --> 04:53.233
I'm making a special meal
for my buddy,

04:53.268 --> 04:55.001
Ambassador Rollin,
from Monrovia.

04:55.036 --> 04:56.811
I'm protecting him
while he's in town.

04:56.846 --> 04:59.238
Interesting.
You run all over town

04:59.274 --> 05:01.174
shopping for him,
but for our anniversary,

05:01.209 --> 05:03.760
you show up with a box of tacos.

05:03.795 --> 05:06.054
That's our thing.
We're both foodies.

05:06.090 --> 05:08.047
I like food.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.557
This is different. I like him.

05:09.593 --> 05:11.460
Excuse me?!

05:11.495 --> 05:13.811
I mean, I like working with him.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.305
Excuse me?!!

05:16.341 --> 05:18.591
I meant we have a lot in common.

05:18.627 --> 05:21.711
Does Ambassador Rollin
also love sleeping on the couch,

05:21.746 --> 05:23.471
because if you keep talking,

05:23.507 --> 05:25.267
I'm guessing you'll have
that in common, too.

05:34.442 --> 05:36.534
Hello, fellow co-worker.
My name is Stella.

05:38.663 --> 05:40.672
My parents think
I'm too spoiled,

05:40.707 --> 05:41.934
so they made me get
like, a job here,

05:41.958 --> 05:46.561
but the joke's on them,

05:46.597 --> 05:50.065
band now I'm making it waitt
catill after my shift. E,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.784
Trent. Trent Blaze.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.644
Brooding bad boy.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.054
Sauerkraut enthusiast.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.178
Why did the Organization
put me in disguise and not you?

06:00.202 --> 06:02.326
I am in disguise.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.520
These aren't my usual specs.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.492
Are they your usual
prescription?

06:09.527 --> 06:10.451
Just put your regular
glasses back on.

06:10.486 --> 06:12.445
I can't break my cover.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.941
What cover? Bugs Bunny
has a better cover

06:13.965 --> 06:15.481
when he dresses like
a lady bunny.

06:15.517 --> 06:18.910
Well, good afternoon,
and a better tomorrow.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.445
Welcome to A Better Earth Caf.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.855
I'm Trent. Trent Blaze.

06:22.891 --> 06:25.166
I like sauerkraut.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.796
Hi. I'm Stella.

06:29.831 --> 06:31.734
Even though my parents give me
anything I've ever asked for,

06:31.758 --> 06:33.816
hoped for or dreamed of,

06:33.852 --> 06:36.419
I'm still dissatisfied
with everything.

06:36.454 --> 06:38.371
And it's all their fault.

06:38.406 --> 06:42.350
Wow. You guys are gonna
do well here.

06:42.385 --> 06:44.736
And the better you do,
the more you earn.

06:44.813 --> 06:46.240
And the more you earn,
the more you can give back

06:46.264 --> 06:47.981
to the company.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.641
Uh, excuse me.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.105
Like, why would we wanna
give money back to the people

06:52.129 --> 06:53.035
who are paying us?

06:53.071 --> 06:55.155
You'll see.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.375
So what are you two doing
after work today?

06:59.410 --> 07:02.019
Oh, you know, just the usual.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.972
Like, hating life.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.957
Right on.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.992
We're all going to
the Better Earth Center

07:08.028 --> 07:09.906
for a Volunteen meeting.
You might find it interesting.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.630
I have to check with
my parents first.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.025
I mean, I hate them and I don't
care what they think.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.177
All right.

07:19.615 --> 07:21.915
Great acting, Meryl.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.110
And you wonder why you never
got the lead in<i> Peter Pan.</i>

07:27.739 --> 07:30.122
Surprise!

07:30.158 --> 07:33.560
I made stuffed quail
with truffle sauce,

07:33.595 --> 07:35.562
haricot vert with shallots,

07:35.597 --> 07:37.472
and sherry butter reduction,

07:37.507 --> 07:40.942
and a chocolate espresso
dacquoise for dessert.

07:40.977 --> 07:42.944
Whoo!

07:42.979 --> 07:45.755
Craig, I thought you knew.

07:45.790 --> 07:46.792
I do not eat like that anymore.

07:46.816 --> 07:49.034
Why not?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.943
All that rich, fatty stuff.

07:50.979 --> 07:53.205
It was killing me.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.898
No! But I spent
two days making it.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.534
If you don't eat it,
it'll be killing me.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.203
Besides, it's our thing.

08:01.239 --> 08:03.531
Foodies.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.751
Well, maybe we can have
something new in common.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.994
Like what?

08:08.029 --> 08:10.288
Exercise.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.265
I have a great gym
at the embassy, huh?

08:12.300 --> 08:14.817
What else you got?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.040
Remember when we were kids

08:20.116 --> 08:22.851
and we used to dream about
what our lives would be?

08:22.886 --> 08:25.111
Those dreams never included
hunger or polluted oceans

08:25.146 --> 08:27.471
or global warming.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.949
Alone, I change nothing.
Together, we...

08:29.985 --> 08:32.210
Oop. Sorry, ma'am.
I'm Trent. Trent Blaze.

08:35.439 --> 08:37.549
- Uh, who's she?
- Keller.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.910
She's our leader.

08:40.946 --> 08:42.119
I mean, our friend.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.481
She's our friend.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.393
She always says she's
whoever we need her to be.

08:46.417 --> 08:50.478
Wow! That is so profound.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.679
What the heck is that bunk
supposed to mean?

08:58.763 --> 09:01.147
I'm gonna try to go talk to her.

09:01.183 --> 09:03.883
The world in our dreams
was a beautiful place.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.144
Well, I'm tired of dreaming.

09:06.179 --> 09:09.263
I want that world
with no hunger.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.133
I want a world with
blue oceans and clean air.

09:12.168 --> 09:14.243
That's why I need you guys.

09:14.279 --> 09:17.697
With your hard work,
we can make it happen.

09:17.732 --> 09:20.232
Alone, I'm just one voice.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.276
But together, we are strong.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.737
Together, we can be heard.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.781
Together, we can make
the world of our dreams

09:26.816 --> 09:29.567
a reality!

09:29.602 --> 09:31.903
Say it with me.
Together, we are strong.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.946
ALL: Together, we are strong.

09:33.981 --> 09:35.615
Together, we are strong.

09:35.650 --> 09:39.485
Together, we are strong. Yeah!

09:45.043 --> 09:46.500
Hey, um...

09:46.536 --> 09:48.744
I'm Stella.

09:48.779 --> 09:50.339
I hate everyone,
but, like, you're okay.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.951
Anyway, I just wanna say,

09:54.986 --> 09:56.285
like, I really liked
your speech.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.022
You're, like, saying all the
things that I only, like, think.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.307
Thank you.

10:01.342 --> 10:02.283
I'm happy you're here, Stella.

10:02.319 --> 10:05.094
Or should I say, KC?

10:05.129 --> 10:07.822
KC?

10:07.858 --> 10:10.399
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

10:10.434 --> 10:13.344
So you're not KC Cooper,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.237
teenage spy who works for
the Organization,

10:15.273 --> 10:17.493
and lives with her parents, Kira
and Craig Cooper at 35 Melby Lane?

10:17.517 --> 10:20.468
Okay.

10:20.503 --> 10:22.583
I guess you don't have me
confused with someone else.

10:38.296 --> 10:41.063
Okay, so you know who I am.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.773
So what are you gonna do now?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.959
You gonna eliminate me
or something?

10:44.994 --> 10:46.519
Because this whole
staring thing,

10:46.554 --> 10:48.221
it's starting to freak me out.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.457
Eliminate you?

10:51.492 --> 10:53.642
Please. I don't
eliminate anything.

10:53.678 --> 10:56.421
I'm all about recycling.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.214
I'm not gonna do
anything to you, KC.

10:58.249 --> 11:01.676
What happens next
is completely your choice.

11:01.711 --> 11:02.922
Okay, perfect. So you can
unlock the door, I'll leave,

11:02.946 --> 11:03.844
and we'll pretend
this never happened.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.789
Look...

11:05.824 --> 11:10.743
I'm fully aware the Organization
is investigating me.

11:10.778 --> 11:12.954
So you can go back and tell them
your cover is blown,

11:12.989 --> 11:14.384
and in a few months,
they'll send in someone else.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.290
That sounds good. Let's do that.

11:16.326 --> 11:18.668
But here's another option.

11:18.703 --> 11:21.120
You stay, and see what
this place is about.

11:21.155 --> 11:22.747
I'll give you full access.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.015
And why would you do that?

11:24.050 --> 11:25.941
Because I have nothing to hide.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.502
Oh, really?
Then what about Danielle,

11:28.538 --> 11:29.907
the supposed manager
who just disappeared?

11:29.931 --> 11:32.148
Oh, Danielle.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.717
She went to visit
her sick grandmother in Vermont.

11:34.752 --> 11:36.027
Yeah, I don't believe you.

11:36.062 --> 11:39.163
Please send in Danielle.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.823
Can you just cut the charade?

11:40.858 --> 11:43.251
Look, I know you did
something to her.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.663
Either you eliminated her or she's
lying in a ditch somewhere.

11:44.687 --> 11:45.937
( Door opens )

11:45.972 --> 11:48.464
Hi, KC.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.216
Danielle!

11:50.251 --> 11:51.809
Hey, girl.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.745
How's your grandma?

11:56.833 --> 11:59.208
Not so good.
Thanks for bringing it up.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.500
Okay, so I was wrong about
the Danielle thing.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.316
But what about the Volunteens

12:07.351 --> 12:11.504
that work at your caf giving back
their salary? That is suspicious.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.899
Since when did caring
about our planet become a crime?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.769
Ooh, look, teens caring about
something besides themselves.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.899
We'd better stop them before they
do something good for the world.

12:19.923 --> 12:22.481
We know, if we don't
step up now,

12:22.516 --> 12:25.351
there won't be a planet
to protect later.

12:25.387 --> 12:28.062
Well, I never thought
about it like that.

12:28.097 --> 12:30.164
Then stick around.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.625
I believe in what we're doing,

12:32.661 --> 12:34.738
and I think, if you give us a
chance, you'll believe, too.

12:34.762 --> 12:38.481
Wait, so, we're talking
healthy food,

12:38.516 --> 12:42.701
fresh air, and clean oceans?

12:42.737 --> 12:44.231
I don't know.
That's pretty radical thinking.

12:44.255 --> 12:45.755
Can I get back to you on that?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.472
The device is in place,
and has been armed.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.667
<i>Good work, Danielle.</i>

12:57.702 --> 12:58.659
<i>Now get out of the embassy,</i>

12:58.695 --> 13:01.270
before there is no embassy.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.767
Feels less like I'm spotting,

13:06.803 --> 13:09.887
and more like I'm doing
the actual lifting.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.592
Interesting, because to me,
it feels like...

13:11.616 --> 13:14.550
we're done.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.703
Maybe cardio's more your speed.

13:17.739 --> 13:21.791
This one is my favorite.

13:21.826 --> 13:24.052
You enjoy it.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.020
I'll be in the diner
having an egg-white omelet,

13:26.055 --> 13:27.733
wrapped in a regular omelet
wrapped in bacon and sausage.

13:27.757 --> 13:30.983
Come on, give it a try.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.046
I will go get us
some eucalyptus towels.

13:32.070 --> 13:34.887
It is wonderful, like wiping
your face with a cough drop.

13:36.499 --> 13:38.199
Crazy.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.727
Ready now.

13:40.762 --> 13:42.478
Hey.

13:42.513 --> 13:44.305
Look at that.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.049
Craig.

13:47.084 --> 13:48.834
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

13:48.870 --> 13:50.381
We have credible intel
that a bomb has been hidden

13:50.405 --> 13:52.146
in one of the embassy's
cardio machines.

13:52.181 --> 13:53.848
Any idea which is
Rollins' favorite?

13:53.883 --> 13:55.908
Unfortunately, I do,
and I'm on it.

13:57.912 --> 14:00.463
Don't panic.
The bomb's only activated

14:00.540 --> 14:02.201
when the elliptical reaches
five miles an hour.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.482
What's your speed?

14:03.518 --> 14:06.219
Six miles an hour.

14:06.254 --> 14:08.646
It's okay, Craig.
We're gonna disarm it.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.249
But until we do, you can't
drop below five miles an hour,

14:11.284 --> 14:12.884
or ka-boom! It's gonna blow up.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.063
You can do it,
but if you get tired,

14:17.098 --> 14:18.664
just give us a heads up

14:18.699 --> 14:21.634
so we can get out of
splatter range.

14:21.669 --> 14:22.977
I just got my puffs done.

14:27.525 --> 14:29.692
Alone, I change nothing.

14:29.728 --> 14:31.627
Together, we change the world.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.170
ALL: Alone, I change nothing.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.606
Together, we change the world.

14:35.642 --> 14:39.227
Alone, I change nothing.
Together, we change the world.

14:39.262 --> 14:42.038
Seriously, it's like Keller's
got everybody in a trance.

14:42.073 --> 14:45.316
Our cover's blown. We should go
report back to the Organization.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.336
No, bro, we can't leave yet.

14:48.371 --> 14:49.423
We have no credible intel that
proves that Keller's even a threat.

14:49.447 --> 14:51.238
Besides, from what
I've observed,

14:51.273 --> 14:53.007
she seems to be
on the up and up.

14:53.042 --> 14:55.417
Of course she seems
to be on the up and up.

14:55.453 --> 14:58.312
Bad people always seem
to be on the up and up,

14:58.348 --> 15:00.042
because what better way to look
like you're on the up and up

15:00.066 --> 15:02.375
than to act like
you're on the up and up?

15:02.410 --> 15:05.235
Would you shush
about the up and up?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.265
Look, bro, no one has gotten
as close to Keller as I have.

15:07.289 --> 15:08.997
If we go back to
the Organization,

15:09.033 --> 15:10.774
they're just gonna
send someone else,

15:10.810 --> 15:11.912
and what good is that gonna do?

15:11.936 --> 15:13.644
I guess that makes sense.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.505
Let's hurry it up.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.397
I need some real food,

15:17.433 --> 15:19.375
like a chicken nugget
shaped like a dinosaur.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.578
( Chanting continues )

15:29.771 --> 15:31.904
I can dismantle it.

15:31.939 --> 15:34.707
My bomb-defusing skills
are the bomb!

15:34.742 --> 15:36.008
Old joke. Keep working.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.845
Okay, the ambassador is fine,

15:39.881 --> 15:42.030
and the embassy's
been evacuated.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.276
Great. Did you find me
anything to eat?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.012
I've been working out
for two hours, and I'm starving.

15:45.036 --> 15:46.218
I found some soup.

15:46.253 --> 15:48.646
Soup?!

15:48.681 --> 15:49.455
How am I supposed to eat that
and keep moving, baby?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.256
Let's try.

15:51.292 --> 15:53.609
Okay, wait, wait.

15:53.645 --> 15:55.286
Be careful. Wait, wait, wait!

15:55.321 --> 15:56.470
( Both talking at once )

15:56.506 --> 15:58.172
I'm trying to do it.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.542
Wait. Wait a minute.
Now I can't see.

16:01.577 --> 16:03.719
Let me try and... Wait, here.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.497
Slow down!

16:06.533 --> 16:07.506
If you would
bring your face down!

16:07.541 --> 16:09.984
Never mind, never mind.

16:10.019 --> 16:12.044
Thank you.
I'm not hungry anymore.

16:15.316 --> 16:17.658
One of the biggest problems
affecting the world today

16:17.693 --> 16:20.228
is we can't get good food.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.507
Some have too little,
while others have too much

16:21.531 --> 16:23.631
of the wrong kind.

16:23.666 --> 16:25.441
A lot of people rely on
junk food

16:25.476 --> 16:27.100
because it's cheap and easy.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.645
She left out delicious.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.022
I'd kill for some
aerosol cheese right now.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.777
Or anything blue.
That's my favorite flavor.

16:35.403 --> 16:36.936
Ernie, sh! What she's saying...

16:36.971 --> 16:38.780
KC, did you have
something to add?

16:38.815 --> 16:41.182
Oh, no, sorry.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.817
- Please. Join me up front.
- Nah, I'm good.

16:43.853 --> 16:46.019
It's okay, KC.
Your opinion is valued here.

16:46.055 --> 16:47.463
This isn't school.

16:47.499 --> 16:50.508
Well, uh...

16:50.543 --> 16:52.376
I was just agreeing with you.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.939
Fresh fruits and vegetables
are expensive,

16:53.963 --> 16:55.654
and really hard to find.

16:55.689 --> 16:56.976
Meanwhile, there's
a convenience store

16:57.000 --> 16:58.883
at every corner
selling junk food.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.877
People deserve decent food
at decent prices

17:01.913 --> 17:04.154
instead of giant apples
and heads of lettuce

17:04.190 --> 17:05.990
that are covered in
pesticides and herbicides.

17:06.918 --> 17:11.604
I mean, those foods could
survive a zombie apocalypse

17:11.639 --> 17:13.897
and are laced with enough
chemicals to cause one.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.191
And I, for one, am tired of it.

17:17.195 --> 17:18.861
She's right.

17:18.896 --> 17:22.573
It's time for affordable,
healthy food for everyone.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.534
We have to take action
if we want change.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.100
Volunteens around the country

17:33.136 --> 17:35.519
are gonna stop
the scheduled delivery

17:35.554 --> 17:37.947
of chemically enhanced produce,
at Agro Inc. Supermarkets.

17:37.982 --> 17:40.115
We'll launch
simultaneous protests

17:40.150 --> 17:42.367
and make sure
our message is heard.

17:42.403 --> 17:44.061
Health not wealth.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.412
ALL: Health not wealth.

17:45.448 --> 17:48.048
Health not wealth.

17:48.084 --> 17:50.171
If we want fresh food,
we have to get our hands dirty.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.886
- We have to break some rules.
- Absolutely.

17:52.922 --> 17:56.248
We're gonna stop those trucks
at any cost.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.208
- Who's with me?
- ALL: Yeah!

17:58.244 --> 18:00.869
Health not wealth.
Health not wealth.

18:00.904 --> 18:04.139
( Chanting continues )

18:04.175 --> 18:05.399
Health not wealth.

18:05.434 --> 18:09.245
What is going on?

18:14.819 --> 18:16.844
No more Franken-food.
No more Franken-food.

18:16.879 --> 18:18.454
No more Franken-food.

18:18.489 --> 18:21.415
The media's here!

18:21.451 --> 18:23.604
We want the best food at
affordable prices for everyone!

18:23.628 --> 18:25.494
( All cheering )

18:25.530 --> 18:27.579
The truck is coming.

18:27.614 --> 18:29.390
Volunteens, into position.

18:29.425 --> 18:31.542
( Horn honking )

18:31.577 --> 18:34.461
The Volunteens
will not be ignored.

18:34.497 --> 18:35.663
Block that truck!

18:35.698 --> 18:37.814
ALL: Yeah!

18:37.850 --> 18:39.291
No! No, no, no, no.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.661
I don't even like vegetables.

18:42.697 --> 18:44.082
I'm not gonna stand in the way of
a truck and become a vegetable.

18:44.106 --> 18:45.406
( Horn honking )

18:49.070 --> 18:50.119
Let's do this!

18:59.755 --> 19:01.972
Wow, this just got real.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.108
Yeah, real scary. Time to go.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.360
No. Now's our chance.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.530
We can't let 'em push us around.
We need to send a message.

19:07.554 --> 19:09.755
What's with this "we"?

19:09.790 --> 19:11.740
We are not them.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.410
We are agents for
the Organization.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.756
No, we need to take action if
we wanna create change, okay?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.489
At any cost.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.602
That's Keller talking.
You don't really believe that.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.085
Yes, I do.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.061
And I am sick of living
in this upside-down world.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.746
That's Keller talking, too.

19:25.781 --> 19:26.955
KELLER: What do we want?

19:26.990 --> 19:28.882
ALL: Health not wealth.

19:28.918 --> 19:29.998
- When do we want it?
- Now!

19:37.393 --> 19:41.362
KC, there's something off about
Keller and those Volunteens.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.141
It's like they don't
have a mind of their own.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.660
I don't like it,
and I'm making the decision.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.535
- We're out of here.
- No.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.623
Look, you do what you gotta do,
I'll do what I gotta do.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.564
Health not wealth.
Health not wealth.

19:52.599 --> 19:54.866
( Chanting continues )

19:54.902 --> 19:56.477
Health not wealth.
Health not wealth.

19:59.022 --> 20:01.556
Judy, you have to hurry.

20:01.592 --> 20:02.844
I don't know how much
longer I can... cramp.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.176
Ow, cramp!

20:04.212 --> 20:06.095
He's losing speed.

20:06.130 --> 20:07.913
I got a blinking light
right here.

20:07.948 --> 20:10.131
- Pick up the pace.
- 5.4 and falling.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.850
Craig, we gotta switch places.

20:11.885 --> 20:13.919
- It's too dangerous.
- 5.3. 5.2.

20:13.954 --> 20:15.980
We don't have a choice.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.642
It's too fast.
You won't be able to keep up.

20:17.666 --> 20:19.625
Yeah, baby, that's cute.

20:26.066 --> 20:28.234
Kira! You're pushing me off.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.261
Move over.

20:38.396 --> 20:40.737
Craig, will you get off
the machine so you can rest?

20:40.773 --> 20:43.133
That sounds great, but exactly
how am I supposed to do that?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.377
Like that.

20:54.379 --> 20:57.279
Judy, now much longer before
you defuse the bomb?

20:57.315 --> 21:01.016
Oh, actually, I defused it
ten minutes ago.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.761
I just thought it might be fun
to watch you people panic,

21:03.796 --> 21:05.796
and I was right. It totally was.

21:17.117 --> 21:20.185
( Speaking unintelligibly )

21:22.498 --> 21:24.907
Okay, I can't understand
a word you're saying,

21:24.942 --> 21:26.550
which is usually a good thing,

21:26.585 --> 21:27.951
but that sounded important.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.254
Sorry. I need real food.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.297
Real food?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.752
You're eating flamin' hot
cheese dust.

21:33.776 --> 21:37.044
And apricots.

21:37.079 --> 21:39.137
I'm crazy worried about KC.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.632
She's gone over to their side.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.901
What are you talking about?
That makes no sense.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.644
I didn't say it made sense.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.846
I'm saying she's buying
every word Keller says.

21:47.881 --> 21:49.698
Hook, line and sinker.

21:49.733 --> 21:52.459
No, Ernie, she's just
using standard

21:52.495 --> 21:54.587
psy-ops training to get
closer to the target.

21:54.622 --> 21:56.121
She has to act like
she believes.

21:56.156 --> 21:58.131
Yeah, son, KC's just
working Keller.

21:58.166 --> 22:00.317
No, Dad.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.478
Keller's working her.

22:07.869 --> 22:10.077
( All chanting )
We can create change.

22:10.112 --> 22:12.070
We can create change.

22:12.106 --> 22:14.957
KC Cooper, please step forward.

22:14.992 --> 22:18.285
( Chanting continues )

22:24.243 --> 22:26.351
I pledge my allegiance
to the Volunteens,

22:26.387 --> 22:28.307
and sign this lifetime
contract to create change.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.676
I'm glad you're with us, KC.

22:42.712 --> 22:45.813
We're planning something big
that'll change everything

22:45.848 --> 22:47.576
It's dangerous, and we need
someone we can count on.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.074
Are you with us?

22:49.110 --> 22:52.628
At any cost.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.988
( Chanting resumes )

23:00.488 --> 23:03.004
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
