00:13.530 --> 00:15.300
You know I have the fuel rods.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.930
But I have no desire to harm innocent Americans.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.430
And yet you're threatening them with a bomb.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.860
What I'm asking for is simple.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.300
Turn over President Hassan.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.300
That will never happen.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.560
You have exactly one hour to change your mind.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.229
We have an out here.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.900
I think we should take it.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.660
Give in to the demand

00:35.730 --> 00:37.430
to turn over President Hassan?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.600
I will not sell him out to the very terrorists

00:39.660 --> 00:41.760
that we are determined to defeat.

00:41.830 --> 00:42.930
What are you suggesting?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.260
A covert action.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.800
We deliver Hassan to the terrorists, but make it look

00:46.860 --> 00:48.260
like they took him hostage.

00:48.330 --> 00:49.630
I'm begging you.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.060
Don't do this.

00:51.130 --> 00:52.960
Don't betray your president.

00:53.030 --> 00:55.800
Ethan?

00:55.860 --> 00:57.200
All right.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.730
My God! Call 911.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.460
We wait to acquire Hassan before calling an ambulance.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.660
Understand?

01:13.230 --> 01:15.530
Take the weapon off now!

01:15.600 --> 01:18.260
A dirty bomb will be detonated in New York

01:18.330 --> 01:19.900
unless we deliver Hassan to the terrorists.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.700
Does the president know about this?

01:21.760 --> 01:23.560
She's refusing to deal with the terrorists.

01:23.630 --> 01:25.100
This is General Brucker's operation.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.630
- Get up.  - What are you doing?

01:27.700 --> 01:28.860
This is on you now.

01:28.930 --> 01:31.000
You have to deliver Hassan to the terrorists.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.000
I don't take orders from anybody

01:32.060 --> 01:33.160
but the president of the United States.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.000
Now, move.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.730
Are the Americans handing over Hassan or not?

01:37.800 --> 01:39.230
The only information we have

01:39.300 --> 01:40.930
is that he's being transported to McGuire Air Force Base.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.060
So, President Taylor doesn't intend to give him up.

01:44.130 --> 01:45.960
- Tarin.  - Yes?

01:46.030 --> 01:47.530
The president has not responded.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.830
Start the countdown.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.330
The NYPD will handle hazmat and triage;

02:33.400 --> 02:35.300
the National Guard will control the streets;

02:35.360 --> 02:38.100
and I've got an army battalion standing by.

02:38.160 --> 02:42.360
Well, a dirty bomb is about to go off in Manhattan, Commander.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.760
I'd plan for mass panic.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.930
Ethan Kanin is dying back there. We need

02:48.000 --> 02:49.400
- to get him medical help.  - We will.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.030
- I mean now.  - No, not until our team comptes its mission.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.700
When we have the bomb, then we'll get your friend help.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.560
Madam President.

02:56.630 --> 02:57.800
Carry on.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.330
General, what's our status?

03:00.400 --> 03:01.660
Well, the civilian first responders

03:01.730 --> 03:03.360
are positioning for rapid deployment,

03:03.430 --> 03:05.330
and we've got army support available as necessary.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.860
At this point, only command level knows

03:06.930 --> 03:07.960
we're anticipating a radiological device,

03:08.030 --> 03:09.060
but people on the ground

03:09.130 --> 03:10.630
are quick to connect the dots.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.330
- Word will get out.  - Yeah. I'd like to get ahead of that.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.060
I've drafted an address

03:15.130 --> 03:17.300
for the networks, Rob, I need you to look at it.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.900
And I'd like Ethan to read it, too.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.430
He wasn't in his office. Do you know where he is?

03:22.930 --> 03:24.260
I'll go find him.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.460
Less than ten minutes.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.700
Dear God, this bomb cannot go off.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.400
I'm sorry, Madam President, but we have to prepare

03:34.460 --> 03:35.830
for the worst.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.900
What are the latest casualty figures?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.160
Median scenario shows 58,000 dead over three days

03:41.230 --> 03:43.860
due to the bomb and ensuing panic.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.060
But who knows?

03:45.130 --> 03:46.760
Maybe we'll get lucky.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.700
Let me know the second President Hassan arrives.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.560
Yes, ma'am.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.400
This is not right.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.959
My life for so many others.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.529
It's not right.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.200
President Taylor doesn't see it that way.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.030
She knows I would never have gone along with this decision.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.360
That's why she kept me out of it.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.230
You are more than just one life, Omar.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.000
You are the best hope

04:33.060 --> 04:35.160
of ending a war that has lasted for decades.

04:35.230 --> 04:36.500
You must understand President Taylor

04:36.560 --> 04:37.660
trying to protect that.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.160
This is not acceptable... not like this.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.930
Get in here.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Get down.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.460
What are you doing?

04:54.530 --> 04:55.700
He's slowing us down.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.900
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.160
His injuries aren't lethal.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.560
Jack, I need to talk to you.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.060
What?

05:03.130 --> 05:04.800
Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's response

05:04.860 --> 05:06.060
to the ultimatum.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.660
Doesn't matter. It doesn't affect our mission.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.600
He's a head of state, Jack. Maybe it should.

05:09.660 --> 05:10.730
It's not our call. If he wants

05:10.800 --> 05:11.860
to take it up with President Taylor,

05:11.930 --> 05:14.000
he can do it when he sees... 

05:14.060 --> 05:15.360
- Mom!  - What?

05:15.430 --> 05:17.360
- Throw your gun down.  - Omar, what are you doing?

05:17.430 --> 05:19.030
Mr. President. 

05:19.100 --> 05:20.730
Kick it to me.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.400
Omar, have you lost your mind?

05:25.900 --> 05:26.960
You, outside!

05:27.030 --> 05:28.160
Back up inside!

05:28.230 --> 05:29.900
Sir, you do not want to do...

05:29.960 --> 05:31.730
Just shut up and move it inside!

05:31.800 --> 05:33.600
I'm giving you what you want.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.900
Here, take the gun.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.160
Omar, what are you doing?

05:37.230 --> 05:38.600
I'm sorry, Dalia.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.130
My life for tens of thousands?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.460
- I couldn't live with that.  - Omar, don't.

05:42.530 --> 05:44.160
You can't give yourself up.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.860
I have to.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.260
What if they're lying?

05:48.460 --> 05:50.700
What if they blow up the bomb anyway?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.700
At least I've tried to stop the attack, and I've failed.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.260
But if I don't even try...

05:55.330 --> 05:57.060
Father, please.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.660
You stay here with Kayla. I'll send someone

05:58.730 --> 06:00.260
- from our delegation to pick you up.  - No.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.200
No. I won't leave you.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.730
- Dalia, do as I say. Do as I say!  - If you want me to stay here,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.360
then you better lock me in that room

06:06.430 --> 06:08.930
because I won't let you walk to your death!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.230
- I won't leave you!  - Dalia, I said do as I say!

06:11.300 --> 06:13.030
- No!  - Back in the room!

06:13.100 --> 06:14.260
Now! In the room!

06:19.200 --> 06:21.260
We've got less than five minutes. We got to move.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.100
Mr. President!

06:25.130 --> 06:26.460
Mr. President, you can't trust him!

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
You can't trust him!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.760
Come on.

07:08.530 --> 07:09.930
These people owe you their lives, sir.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.430
You're doing the right thing.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.730
Excuse me.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.100
Do you have the package?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.360
Yes.

07:31.430 --> 07:32.900
You're cutting it damn close. You know that?

07:32.960 --> 07:34.530
Yeah, there were complications.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.360
Jack Bauer found out about our operation.

07:39.430 --> 07:41.030
He's no longer a problem.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.700
Casualties?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.200
The entire unit.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.830
Everyone but me.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.260
Sir, you need to know

07:47.330 --> 07:49.130
that President Hassan is cooperating with us.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
He's here by choice.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.360
Well, what are you saying?

07:51.430 --> 07:53.330
That he would have given himself up?

07:53.400 --> 07:55.130
Yes, sir. We got to move.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.730
All right. Stay on the line.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.260
Weiss.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.730
Look at him. He'll be dead soon

08:09.800 --> 08:11.130
if we don't do something.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.930
Yeah, along with half of New York. Bishop's on the line.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.360
He's got Hassan. Get ready to make the call.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.160
Bishop, we're live. You there?

08:26.230 --> 08:28.200
- Yes, sir.  - All right, we got less than two minutes. Do it.

08:38.130 --> 08:40.159
- Yes.  - This is Rob Weiss,

08:40.230 --> 08:41.330
President Taylor's chief of staff.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.630
Do you have Hassan?

08:42.700 --> 08:44.860
Yes, and we're prepared to make the exchange.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.200
Prove it.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.660
Uh, Bishop, put him on.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.860
He wants to talk to you.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.260
This is President Hassan.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.100
I'm prepared to give myself up

09:00.160 --> 09:01.600
if you stop the bomb.

09:01.660 --> 09:03.960
So, President Taylor changed her mind.

09:04.030 --> 09:07.000
No. She wasn't willing to meet your demands.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.260
I am.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.930
But I need assurances.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.460
- Assurances?  - Yeah.

09:11.530 --> 09:12.730
That the exchange will...

09:12.800 --> 09:15.130
The exchange will happen exactly as you're told.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.730
What you'll do is exactly what I say.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.360
Damn it. We did what you asked.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.960
Quit stalling. We're running out of time.

09:22.530 --> 09:24.500
He cut us off.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.900
A minute and a half till the bomb goes off.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.030
Yes?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.330
Tarin...

10:42.400 --> 10:44.360
stop the bomb.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.830
Hassan will be arriving there shortly.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.860
You know what to do.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.830
Yes, all right.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.730
Bomb was supposed to go off four minutes ago.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.830
There's no report

11:18.900 --> 11:20.400
of an explosion anywhere on the island.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.930
Arlo, what's happening on the ground?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.030
Sweep teams are still looking everywhere. No luck.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.930
According to the deadline we've been given,

11:26.000 --> 11:26.960
we're on borrowed time.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.730
The bomb is still out there,

11:28.800 --> 11:30.530
still a threat.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.260
We may have caught a break here.

11:32.330 --> 11:34.160
Let's use it.

11:34.230 --> 11:35.360
O'Brian.

11:35.430 --> 11:36.930
Chloe, it's Jack. I need your help.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.130
Reception is terrible.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.330
I can barely hear you.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.000
- Can you hear me now?  - Yes.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.160
President Hassan is trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.

11:43.230 --> 11:44.360
That's why the bomb didn't go off.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.260
No one here knows that.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.130
And no one else can until I talk to the president.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.230
What's going on?

11:50.300 --> 11:52.060
Chloe, I don't have time to explain.

11:52.130 --> 11:53.730
Please, just contact Tim Woods.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.400
He can get me a clean line to the president.

11:55.460 --> 11:56.760
But no one else can know that I'm calling.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.260
Do you understand?

11:58.330 --> 12:00.230
I'll call you right back.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.460
Who was that?

12:01.530 --> 12:03.000
Search team.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.260
Requesting updated grid assignments.

12:04.330 --> 12:05.900
Do you need some help?

12:05.960 --> 12:07.960
I'll ask if I do.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.330
We're clear!

12:25.430 --> 12:28.430
Keep them up here on the landing.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.260
Nothing.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.100
I need you to get them back to President Taylor.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.300
What about you?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.360
I'm going to say behind and look for Hassan.

12:49.730 --> 12:50.960
Ma'am, I just got off the phone with CTU.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.200
They're going to help me find your husband.

12:52.260 --> 12:53.900
But right now it's not safe here for you.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
I want you and your daughter

12:55.030 --> 12:56.230
to continue on to the Air Force Base.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.500
Agent Walker will help you get there.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.160
She can be trusted completely.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.130
Mr. Bauer, my father, he did

13:01.200 --> 13:03.000
- what he thought was best.  - I know he did.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.460
We're gonna do everything we can to get him back,

13:04.530 --> 13:05.900
but right now we need to move.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.600
Let's go.

13:08.660 --> 13:11.000
Jack, he gave himself up willingly.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.460
Maybe we should just let this happen.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.100
I already told you, it's not our call.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.500
President Taylor asked me to protect him.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.760
That's what I'm gonna try and do.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.760
So, please, just get them to the Air Force Base.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.730
Taxi!

13:22.760 --> 13:24.760
Come on.

13:27.030 --> 13:28.100
This is Bauer.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.430
I got a secure line.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.000
Good. Chloe, I need you to do something else for me.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.930
I'm on Seventh Avenue between 53rd and 54th.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.360
There's a security camera mid-block.

13:35.430 --> 13:37.630
I want you to see if you can get a feed and roll it back.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.300
President Hassan was standing here less than ten minutes ago.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.400
I'll check.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.200
Seven minutes past the deadline.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.230
Do we have any idea why the bomb didn't go off?

13:47.300 --> 13:48.560
No, Madam President.

13:48.630 --> 13:49.830
We're polling our civilian counterparts,

13:49.900 --> 13:50.860
trying to determine that.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.860
Maybe it's like you said.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.460
We got lucky.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.230
Well, at the moment it certainly looks that way.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.330
What about President Hassan?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.760
When will he arrive?

13:58.830 --> 14:00.700
Well, his transport was a Secret Service operation, ma'am.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.230
- I'm not really in the loop.  - I'll look into it.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.900
No, I'd rather you find Ethan.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.500
- I'll page him.  - No,

14:05.560 --> 14:06.700
not page him, find him.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.200
I need him here.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.960
Please.

14:10.030 --> 14:11.860
Yes, ma'am.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.060
- Madam President?  - Yes?

14:13.130 --> 14:14.400
It's an urgent call from Homeland for you.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.400
Excuse me.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.060
This is President Taylor.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.530
Madam President, this is Jack Bauer.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.730
Please don't say my name

14:20.800 --> 14:22.800
or react openly to what I'm about to tell you.

14:22.860 --> 14:23.860
Yes.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.500
President Hassan is no longer in my custody.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.830
He got away

14:26.900 --> 14:28.600
and he's trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.100
That's why the bomb didn't detonate.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.860
I'm afraid I don't understand.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.760
Madam President, you're being betrayed by General Brucker.

14:33.830 --> 14:36.100
40 minutes ago we were attacked by mercenaries

14:36.160 --> 14:37.360
under his command.

14:37.430 --> 14:38.560
Go on.

14:38.630 --> 14:39.860
We managed to fight off the attack,

14:39.930 --> 14:41.860
but President Hassan turned himself over to one of them

14:41.930 --> 14:43.930
in an effort to stop the bomb from going off.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.230
As we speak,

14:45.300 --> 14:46.760
they're preparing to hand him over to the terrorists.

14:46.830 --> 14:48.060
I'm assuming that that is still something

14:48.130 --> 14:49.630
that is unacceptable to you.

14:49.700 --> 14:50.930
That is correct.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.400
Madam President, General Brucker is in charge

14:52.460 --> 14:53.560
of this operation.

14:53.630 --> 14:54.400
He's in communication with the terrorists.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.860
I need to know

14:55.930 --> 14:58.100
where the exchange is gonna take place.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.300
- Ma'am, you need to confront him now.  - I understand.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.460
As soon as you have anything, please contact CTU.

15:02.530 --> 15:03.660
I will.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.730
Thank you, ma'am.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.230
Come with me, please.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.360
Chloe, it's Jack. You still there?

15:16.430 --> 15:18.360
- I'm here.  - What do you got?

15:18.430 --> 15:21.130
Got the security camera feed you were talking about.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.300
Hassan got into a black SUV at 6:08 with one other guy.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.560
That's got to be the merc he handed himself over to.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.130
They were headed west on 53rd Street.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.960
I was able to trace them until they turned north

15:30.030 --> 15:31.300
- on Tenth Avenue.  - Okay, good work.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.300
Redirect the satellites to the Upper West Side.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.860
I'm on my way.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.300
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:51.300 --> 15:53.000
Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey!

16:18.430 --> 16:20.430
What now?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.960
Who's this?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.300
Listen carefully.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.300
Hand the phone to the driver.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.300
Tarin.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.300
It's you, isn't it?

16:43.360 --> 16:45.700
Hand it to him now.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.730
He wants to talk to you.

16:52.030 --> 16:54.200
It's Bishop.

16:54.260 --> 16:55.730
Okay, Bishop,

16:55.800 --> 16:57.160
this is what you need to do.

16:57.230 --> 17:00.100
Listen to my instructions and follow them.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.130
Step out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.200
Take the phone with you. Do it now.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.599
Walk toward the intersection.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.360
When the light changes, I want you to cross the street.

17:31.430 --> 17:34.200
Stay inside the crosswalk.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.360
Where's the bomb?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.300
Just do what I say.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.130
The deal was Hassan for the bomb.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.560
The light's changed. Bishop, move.

17:59.430 --> 18:01.560
Where is it?

18:01.630 --> 18:04.030
Just do what I say.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.930
Shut up. Listen.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.460
Stop now.

18:11.530 --> 18:14.460
Don't turn around or you get nothing.

18:14.530 --> 18:16.530
Stand there and wait.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.100
Turn around.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.660
Walk toward the newspaper stand. Look down.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.730
Show me your hands.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.500
Hands!

18:26.560 --> 18:29.130
On the dash.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.360
Where's the bomb?

18:31.660 --> 18:33.800
Where is it?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.500
Where is he?

19:00.560 --> 19:01.530
The General's in Mr. Kanin's office.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.000
With Ethan?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.130
We're not sure. No one's seen him in nearly an hour.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.300
Ma'am, there's something you need to know.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.330
Your chief of staff is with the General.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.330
They appear to be in on this together.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.000
Are you saying Rob Weiss betrayed me, too?

19:15.060 --> 19:17.030
I'm afraid so.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.200
Okay, do it.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.200
Don't move.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.700
Hands where we can see them!

20:00.760 --> 20:02.360
Up!

20:02.430 --> 20:04.060
Call medical.

20:04.130 --> 20:06.200
Against the wall, hands behind your head.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.100
Madam President, you need to see this.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.700
Oh, my God.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.400
Is he still alive?

20:21.460 --> 20:22.530
Yes, ma'am.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.900
He's had a serious cardiac event.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.160
Get him out of here!

20:29.000 --> 20:31.430
No! You stay.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.600
Where is President Hassan?

20:38.460 --> 20:39.760
Damn you, Rob.

20:39.830 --> 20:40.960
Where is he?

20:41.030 --> 20:42.860
I don't know.

20:42.930 --> 20:44.560
Don't lie to me!

20:44.630 --> 20:46.460
Tell me where he is.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.030
No, ma'am, I cannot.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.960
And if it makes any difference,

20:50.030 --> 20:51.900
this was not an easy decision.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.900
It makes no difference at all.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.960
It wasn't your decision to make.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.960
With all due respect,

20:58.030 --> 21:00.160
you were not elected to sentence tens of thousands of Americans

21:00.230 --> 21:01.830
to death.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.830
Is that how you justify this?

21:03.900 --> 21:05.830
You have sold out a peace

21:05.900 --> 21:07.100
I committed this administration to.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.100
I've protected New York

21:09.160 --> 21:10.760
and given you plausible deniability

21:10.830 --> 21:12.130
in an impossible situation.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.630
I don't want deniability. I want Hassan!

21:15.700 --> 21:18.400
We are on the verge of a peace

21:18.460 --> 21:21.900
that has eluded this planet for 50 years,

21:21.960 --> 21:24.160
and you are throwing it away!

21:24.230 --> 21:26.460
Tell me where he is.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.500
The charge is treason.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.500
It carries the death penalty,

21:35.560 --> 21:37.830
and so help me God, I'll throw the switch myself.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.800
Tell me where he is.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.530
It's not too late. 

21:47.660 --> 21:48.630
It is too late.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.660
They have Hassan.

21:50.730 --> 21:53.430
We have the bomb.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.660
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.900
We'll get NEST team there as soon as possible.

22:02.060 --> 22:04.360
Damn you, Rob.

22:04.430 --> 22:06.360
Really, Madam President?

22:06.430 --> 22:08.360
New York City is safe.

22:13.230 --> 22:15.230
Take him away!

22:42.560 --> 22:45.000
Your attention, please.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.060
I've just spoken with the president

22:47.130 --> 22:49.100
at McGuire.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.100
Rogue operatives have handed Hassan over to the terrorists.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.300
In return, they got the location

22:54.360 --> 22:57.800
of the dirty bomb: 93rd and Amsterdam.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.930
Jack Bauer and NEST are already on-site and disarming the bomb.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.660
Our focus is to recover President Hassan.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.430
I've got satellite feed at 93rd, sir.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.000
Okay, looks like we're back in business.

23:10.060 --> 23:12.530
Put it up on-screen, Arlo.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.300
We know that President Hassan was handed over

23:18.360 --> 23:19.460
at that location approximately ten minutes ago.

23:19.530 --> 23:21.100
NSA feed only gives us still images.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.330
We might have missed him.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.060
We didn't. There's Bishop's SUV.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.960
Okay,

23:26.030 --> 23:27.260
they've got to be close; find them.

23:27.330 --> 23:29.160
Someone's approaching the SUV.

23:29.230 --> 23:30.260
Any idea who that is?

23:30.330 --> 23:32.130
I can try to clean up the image.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.130
Lost it.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.330
They were heading east.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.830
We can backtrack through the traffic cam footage.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.030
I want you and Dana to find

23:37.100 --> 23:39.260
that vehicle. As soon as you reacquire it,

23:39.330 --> 23:41.260
let Jack know.

23:41.330 --> 23:43.300
Dana, where are you going?

23:43.360 --> 23:44.630
Hastings wants us to do this.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.700
I was thinking I would reroute some of the servers.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.100
Not now.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.000
It'll give us more processing speed.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.800
We can work with what we have. Let's get going.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.330
Okay.

24:11.260 --> 24:13.030
Those are the rods we were looking for, sir,

24:13.100 --> 24:15.060
packed in enough C4 to irradiate half of Manhattan.

24:15.130 --> 24:16.300
Okay, as soon as they're extracted,

24:16.360 --> 24:17.530
I want you to contact CTU.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.830
Thanks. Yes, sir.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.460
I want him transferred back to holding in medical.

24:21.530 --> 24:22.900
Contact Hastings as you're en route.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.260
So it's real.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.300
A dirty bomb.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.000
Yeah.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.930
Then we succeeded.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.330
We saved Manhattan.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.500
You betrayed your president and your country.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.600
Get him out of here.

24:39.700 --> 24:40.830
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

24:40.900 --> 24:41.830
Jack, it's Chloe.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.100
We've got Hassan's location.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.700
He's heading north on Amsterdam in a black SUV.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.260
- How far north?  - About...

24:47.330 --> 24:49.400
- 30 blocks ahead of you.  - Jack, the president wants us

24:49.460 --> 24:51.260
to do everything we can to recover Hassan.

24:51.330 --> 24:52.730
She wants you to lead the operation.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.200
How many men are with him?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.800
- We think only one... the driver.  - Okay, Chloe,

24:55.860 --> 24:57.330
I need you to find me a suitable ambush point.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.260
I want clean lines of fire from rooftop and street level.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.530
In order to protect Hassan, we need to take the vehicle

25:02.600 --> 25:04.030
and the driver out at the same time.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.560
Tac teams are standing by, Jack.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.930
- Is Cole with them?  - No, on his way back.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.260
We expect him here any minute.

25:08.330 --> 25:09.930
Then he's going to have to quarterback this op from CTU.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I'll get you real-time updates

25:11.060 --> 25:12.760
on the position of Hassan's vehicle.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.660
Copy that.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.030
Cole's back.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.300
I'll go get him.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.030
Yes?

25:42.100 --> 25:43.130
Hello?

25:44.730 --> 25:46.830
I'm so glad you're back.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.630
Yeah, me, too. I heard we recovered the bomb.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.030
Only 'cause Hassan gave himself up to the terrorists.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.660
Jack's putting together an intercept operation right now.

25:52.730 --> 25:54.660
He wants you to run it from here.

25:54.730 --> 25:57.660
All right, you'd better bring me up to speed.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.660
What happened to that probation officer

25:59.730 --> 26:01.000
that was sniffing around?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.660
I convinced him I didn't know anything; he left.

26:02.730 --> 26:04.100
That's good.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.100
Yeah, it's good.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.260
Hey.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.600
We're going to get through this, you and me.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.130
We will.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.930
We should go.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.200
You don't have to do this, Tarin.

26:23.260 --> 26:26.500
You can pull over right now, stop the car.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.500
Believe me, I want to do this.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.400
If you hate me so much, stand against me at home.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.500
Join the opposition.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.600
Fight me openly, honorably.

26:34.660 --> 26:38.060
I don't need to fight you, Hassan.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.130
You have already lost.

26:45.500 --> 26:49.460
So tell me, what's the plan?

26:49.530 --> 26:52.700
You'll put me on trial?

26:52.760 --> 26:57.430
A dark room and a video camera, I suppose.

26:57.500 --> 27:01.660
A man hiding behind a mask...

27:01.730 --> 27:03.500
will read a list of my crimes

27:03.560 --> 27:06.630
and cut off my head with a sword.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.630
The world will be impressed.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.960
You've done worse in your prisons.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.460
Whatever I did...

27:13.530 --> 27:17.360
I did to unite our country, to make us stronger.

27:17.430 --> 27:18.660
That's a lie!

27:18.730 --> 27:20.500
You just wanted to hand us over to the Americans.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.600
No.

27:23.230 --> 27:26.000
I wanted us to rejoin the world.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.530
I wanted us to have peace.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.700
You wanted the cover of Time magazine.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.530
You think I don't know you,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.030
Omar.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.230
I watched over you

27:35.300 --> 27:37.760
day and night, remember, watched over you

27:37.830 --> 27:40.400
while you betrayed your own wife with a Western whore.

27:41.430 --> 27:43.660
You care for nothing

27:43.730 --> 27:46.260
but yourself.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.230
Yes.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.500
Yes, I've made mistakes...

27:58.560 --> 28:00.900
but believing in peace was not one of them.

28:03.900 --> 28:07.300
Think whatever you like.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.660
You won't be around to find out.

28:38.990 --> 28:39.740
Madam President

28:40.030 --> 28:42.030
Just, just a moment.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.130
They're going to treat you on the base hospital.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.260
But then I want you right back here.

28:55.330 --> 28:56.460
That's an order.

28:56.530 --> 28:59.400
Excuse us just a moment.

28:59.460 --> 29:02.960
You have always been true to me, Ethan.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.160
I need you now.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.600
Hurry back.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.660
Take good care of him.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.300
Madam President, Mrs. Hassan and her daughter have just arrived.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.260
Thank you, Susan.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.700
I am

29:26.760 --> 29:28.560
so relieved you're both safe.

29:28.630 --> 29:30.630
Thank you, Madam President.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.630
Do you know what is happening with my husband?

29:32.700 --> 29:34.000
We do.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.100
He is in the hands of the terrorists,

29:36.160 --> 29:37.930
but we're tracking him on satellite.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.130
We're going in now

29:39.200 --> 29:42.230
to monitor the rescue effort.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.230
Do you want to join us?

29:44.300 --> 29:46.430
Yes.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.960
All right.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.160
If you will,

29:49.230 --> 29:50.860
go on in the situation room,

29:50.930 --> 29:52.830
and, and I'll be there in a minute.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.630
Thank you. Thank you.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.630
I didn't expect to see you again, Ms. Walker,

30:04.700 --> 30:07.260
but in these last few hours,

30:07.330 --> 30:11.330
I have learned how few people I can really trust.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.400
I am glad you're here.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.830
Thank you, Madam President.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.700
But I think I'd be of more use at CTU.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.060
Of course.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.060
Susan will arrange a car for you.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.130
Thank you, ma'am.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.460
Thank you.

30:48.660 --> 30:52.160
Jack Bauer and CTU are running the operation.

30:52.230 --> 30:53.500
We expect the intercept to occur

30:53.560 --> 30:54.660
in a few minutes.

30:54.730 --> 30:56.060
Okay.

30:56.130 --> 31:00.760
Ma'am, satellite feed's coming in from CTU.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.300
Jack, Hassan's vehicle just crossed 130th.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.330
I'm at 110th Street.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.760
Do we have an ambush point yet?

31:16.830 --> 31:18.100
Yes, intersection of 161st

31:18.160 --> 31:19.100
and Amsterdam.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.530
Who we got for the take-down team?

31:20.600 --> 31:21.830
I have a special ops unit moving into position.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.100
We'll trigger the traffic lights

31:23.160 --> 31:24.530
to stop the vehicle at the intersection,

31:24.600 --> 31:26.760
then heavy machine gun fire into the engine block

31:26.830 --> 31:28.600
to disable it, snipers to take out the driver.

31:28.660 --> 31:29.600
That leaves you

31:29.660 --> 31:30.730
- to reacquire Hassan.  - Good.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.030
What's our perimeter look like?

31:32.100 --> 31:33.830
Bridges and tunnels were closed earlier this morning.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.000
That means Riverside Drive is shut down, too.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.900
He can only use Amsterdam.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.100
What about cross streets?

31:38.160 --> 31:39.760
We got 'em all covered from 140th Street on.

31:39.830 --> 31:40.930
As long as we don't spook him,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.130
he'll drive straight into the ambush.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
Copy that. Leave this line open

31:43.260 --> 31:44.900
in case there are any changes in the route.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.860
- You got it.  - What's our timing?

31:46.930 --> 31:48.700
Given traffic flow, Tarin should hit the intersection

31:48.760 --> 31:50.760
- in eight minutes.  - I can use traffic lights

31:50.830 --> 31:52.400
to slow him down if Jack hasn't caught up.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.860
Fine, I'll let the president know.

31:53.930 --> 31:55.960
Cole, I'm seeing some fluctuations

31:56.030 --> 31:57.400
in the carrier signal on the subnet.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.430
What's that mean?

31:58.500 --> 31:59.930
It might be a problem with the trunk line.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.930
We can't afford

32:01.000 --> 32:02.530
another dropout with the satellite feed.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.060
That's how we lost the rods in the first place.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.600
Chloe, what's the status of your workaround on the trunk line?

32:06.660 --> 32:08.700
It's working fine if you ask me. Do you need me to check it?

32:08.760 --> 32:09.730
No, we need you here.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.400
I can check it if you can watch my screen,

32:11.460 --> 32:13.100
- Chloe.  - Okay.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.500
Thanks, Dana.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.630
Arlo, what are you doing here?

32:53.700 --> 32:55.630
I could ask you the same.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.660
Cole asked me to check on the trunk line.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.760
Except the trunk line's over here.

33:01.830 --> 33:03.200
I can do it from here also.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.760
I set up this system, you know.

33:04.830 --> 33:05.830
Right.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.400
Sorry.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.730
Then maybe you can explain why they keep going down.

33:12.230 --> 33:14.100
We were hit with a massive electromagnetic pulse.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.930
It's a miracle we managed to get anything

33:16.000 --> 33:18.900
up and running again as fast as we did.

33:23.230 --> 33:25.230
So, what are you doing now?

33:25.300 --> 33:28.200
I'm running a diagnostic on the trunk line.

33:29.630 --> 33:31.500
Why were you looking at a map of Manhattan

33:31.560 --> 33:33.400
if you're running an internal diagnostic?

33:34.760 --> 33:36.860
I was checking the progress of the operation.

33:36.930 --> 33:39.560
How I do my work is none of your business, Arlo.

33:39.630 --> 33:41.230
Actually, given that I've been having

33:41.300 --> 33:42.830
to cover for you the entire night,

33:42.900 --> 33:44.300
I think it is my business.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.230
Fine.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.200
You want to check up on me, go ahead.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.660
You're really going to do this.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.060
Yeah, I am.

34:03.430 --> 34:05.730
So, where are the diagnostics?

34:05.800 --> 34:08.860
In the systems folder, where they always are.

34:08.929 --> 34:12.199
No, I mean... where on your screen?

34:12.260 --> 34:15.100
Thought you said you were working on this.

34:15.159 --> 34:18.030
I wasn't using diagnostics.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.659
I was monitoring the voltage fluctuation

34:20.730 --> 34:22.000
in the trunk line directly.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.360
Really. How?

34:25.830 --> 34:27.760
I thought you knew everything.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.230
- Yeah.  - Arlo, where are you?

34:31.230 --> 34:32.330
Hastings's been looking for you.

34:32.330 --> 34:33.460
Yeah, I'll be right down.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.400
Hastings wants me on the floor.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.730
I'll leave you to do whatever you're doing.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.260
Don't push it, Arlo.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.400
Yes.

35:08.460 --> 35:10.030
CTU is following you.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.560
Where? Where are they?

35:11.630 --> 35:12.760
They're all over you.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.330
There's an ambush set for 161st.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.660
I'm nearly there.

35:15.730 --> 35:17.100
Why am I only hearing this now?

35:17.160 --> 35:19.260
Look, I am already doing far more

35:19.330 --> 35:20.730
than I've been paid to do.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.500
You need to calm down.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.060
We knew this might happen.

35:25.130 --> 35:26.830
Can you find me an exit?

35:26.900 --> 35:29.830
There's one between 158th and 159th.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.000
- parking garage.  - 158th, 159th.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.400
Is everyone ready for this?

35:33.460 --> 35:35.900
I will let Samir know, and then it is up to him.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.130
It's only a matter of time

35:37.200 --> 35:38.110
before this gets traced back to me.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.440
I need you to get the hell out of there when I still can.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.830
Hassan is crossing over 148th Street.

36:13.900 --> 36:17.400
I'm activating signals up to 160th.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.330
You took your time.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.830
I'm sorry. It got complicated.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.230
Is the trunk line going to hold?

36:30.300 --> 36:32.030
Yeah, I think so.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.300
Then we keep going.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.900
What's our timing, Chloe?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.300
Intercept: four minutes.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.300
Jack, do you have a visual on Hassan yet?

36:38.360 --> 36:41.400
- Negative.  - He's five blocks ahead of you, Jack.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.860
Roger that. Tac teams in position?

36:42.930 --> 36:44.660
- They're good to go.  - Okay, nobody move

36:44.730 --> 36:47.730
until Hassan's vehicle is stopped in the intersection.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.630
What are you looking for?

37:10.700 --> 37:12.330
We are being followed, aren't we?

37:12.400 --> 37:13.830
Shut up.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.760
That phone call... it's a warning.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.360
CTU is onto you.

37:18.430 --> 37:19.600
I'm not afraid of CTU.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.100
Why are you looking over your shoulder

37:21.160 --> 37:23.030
- all the time?  - I said shut up!

37:25.300 --> 37:27.360
Tarin, it's not too late.

37:27.430 --> 37:29.500
Give yourself up.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.430
Give yourself up, and I'll speak for you.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
I won't warn you again.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.860
You're on an island here.

37:39.930 --> 37:41.260
There's no way out.

37:41.330 --> 37:42.700
They'll find you.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.060
Yes, they will.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.400
Soon enough.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.830
Damn it. They've made us. He's breaking left.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.260
I repeat: he's breaking left.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.530
Chloe, have you got them?

38:07.600 --> 38:08.760
Can you see where they're going?

38:08.830 --> 38:09.800
Checking.

38:09.860 --> 38:11.100
What's happening? Why did he turn?

38:11.160 --> 38:12.700
He's in a parking garage.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.430
- It extends across the block.  - How many exits?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.130
- Only two.  - Okay, he's going to have

38:16.200 --> 38:18.330
to double back. Where's the other exit?

38:18.400 --> 38:19.900
- Broadway.  - I'll cover that.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.100
Cole, I want you to pull your team back from the ambush point.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.430
- Cover the block.  - You got it.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.430
All teams,

38:24.500 --> 38:25.930
pull back and reposition.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.860
Set a perimeter around the parking garage

38:27.930 --> 38:30.330
between 158th and 159th.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.060
I've got him.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.430
He's going back into the garage.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.000
Copy that. All units converging on your destination.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.500
He's just moving deeper into the structure.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.800
He's got no place else to go, Jack. You got him.

39:10.230 --> 39:11.700
Where did they go?

39:11.760 --> 39:14.160
Inside the structure.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.400
He's running for the roof.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.000
Move! Move!

39:42.100 --> 39:44.200
Where the hell is he going?

39:54.130 --> 39:55.760
Coming straight at me!

39:55.830 --> 39:57.160
Damn it!

40:14.260 --> 40:16.830
Chloe, we got any movement from the target vehicle?

40:16.900 --> 40:19.800
No. No one could survive that.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.460
Chloe, Hassan is not in the vehicle.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.600
You know where to go.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.900
- What if he comes to?  - He won't.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.960
Not before you deliver him. Go!

40:50.030 --> 40:52.860
I said go!

41:16.100 --> 41:17.100
Yeah.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.230
Hey, it's me.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.630
Have you got Hassan?

41:19.700 --> 41:20.860
No. We set up our ambush.

41:20.930 --> 41:22.560
We were seconds away from taking him down,

41:22.630 --> 41:24.630
when out of nowhere, the driver deviated from his route.

41:24.700 --> 41:25.860
He managed to transfer Hassan

41:25.930 --> 41:27.500
to another vehicle before I could get to him.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.100
Someone inside CTU has got to be tipping them off.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.530
How is that possible?

41:30.600 --> 41:32.800
I don't know, but I've got the driver's cell phone.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.430
Soon as we can set up an uplink,

41:34.500 --> 41:36.330
I'll be able to figure out who it is.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.760
I'm on my way to CTU.

41:37.830 --> 41:40.400
- Do you want me to talk to Chloe?  - Yeah, but no one else.

41:40.460 --> 41:42.630
Tell her we need a secure area to run the uplink.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.700
- Get back to me as soon as you're ready.  - Okay.

41:46.530 --> 41:48.060
We need to search the parking structure.

41:48.130 --> 41:48.730
He switched cars.

41:48.950 --> 41:50.440
All units, grid search on the parking structure now.

41:50.590 --> 41:51.310
All right, let's move.

00:01.305 --> 00:07.361
