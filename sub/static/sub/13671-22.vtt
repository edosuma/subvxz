Previously on St Elsewhere -
MONOTONE BEEP

00:03.600 --> 00:05.880
We have a mercy killer
running around.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.680
Nick Moats has been released
from prison.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.120
So much for justice.
What am I going to do?

00:11.120 --> 00:12.440
          Victor, what are you doing?

00:12.440 --> 00:13.680
          Victor, what are you doing?
Proposing.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.560
          Victor, what are you doing?
Proposing.
                      Yes!

00:14.560 --> 00:16.440
She wants the wedding
to be Greek Orthodox?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.440
Zip it up, Elliot, you're
the only person I've told.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.360
Besides, there's nothing
orthodox about either of us.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.680
So it's final.
He says he's sold the hospital

00:22.680 --> 00:24.640
to Magna Fujiyama Incorporated.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.640
Ebenezer B Wright is here to give us
an overview of the company's plans.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.560
I want you people to know that...

00:31.560 --> 00:35.560
I am one of your biggest fans.
And, uh...

02:10.919 --> 02:14.920
Throw that and you're grounded
until your sweet 16th!

02:16.040 --> 02:20.040
You never take me seriously.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.440
Mark, did you spend the night
in here?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.880
Oh, well, Barbara was fussy.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.880
Every time I tried to put her down,
she cried. So we camped out.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.240
You should have
brought her in with us.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.040
I don't want her to get
used to sleeping in our bed.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.760
The best way to break bad habits
is not to start them.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.800
You didn't read Dr Spock
when Stephen was a baby.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.080
Well, I've changed my position
on the good doctor.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.640
He knows his strained carrots.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.640
Speaking of changing,
come on, princess.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.000
Baskin's joining us for breakfast?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.320
Robin went out early.
He's looking for work.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.160
Robin went out early.
He's looking for work.
Good.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.400
I'm getting tickets for
Disney on Ice from Donald!

03:02.400 --> 03:03.800
               Duck?

03:03.800 --> 03:07.800
Westphall. He's got a friend
who works at the Garden.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.240
Just the three of us, huh, princess?

03:10.240 --> 03:13.400
You, me, and the duck.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.640
HE IMITATES DONALD DUCK

03:16.640 --> 03:19.480
Doesn't that sound like
Donald the Duck, hm?

03:19.480 --> 03:22.760
Oh sure, we're going to
see Mickey and Minnie and

03:22.760 --> 03:24.840
Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.160
And Grumpy and Sleepy and Grouchy.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.160
And, oh, Nauseous, and Febrile, hm?

03:34.920 --> 03:37.360
Item four.
Sue Levine, the hammer toes

03:37.360 --> 03:39.680
in the orthopaedics ward
discharged herself.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.760
She was last seen at 3am
walking out of the ER on her hands.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.600
Tell us about your honeymoon.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.960
All right.
Once and for all, Victor Ehrlich

03:49.960 --> 03:52.640
and I did not get secretly
married on a recent vacation.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.640
Nor were we in Mexico as per the
grapevine. We were in Puerto Rico.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.800
I couldn't tell you
what the weather was like,

04:00.800 --> 04:04.800
  but the salsa was muy picante.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.280
Come on, girls,
we still have patients to attend to.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.120
Thank you, Helen, what
would I do without you?!

04:11.120 --> 04:14.120
Our new health maintenance
organisation boss,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.880
Magna Fujiyama, wants everybody to
fill out a professional profile.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.920
  Don't ask me why. Oh, and next.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.920
High colonics are to be administered
therapeutically, not out of malice.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.400
Give them only when they need them.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.760
And last but not least, the flat
foots are still sniffing around

04:28.760 --> 04:32.320
for that so-called mercy killer,
so they want us to keep our guard up.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.120
    All right? Let's go, gang.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.440
OK.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.120
      Oh, and hey, remember.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.120
    Let's be caring out there.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.320
I want to keep the disruption
to a minimum, do you understand?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.800
With the new owners taking over,
we're under a lot of pressure.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.800
So am I.
To wrap up this investigation.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.160
Police make me nervous.

04:56.160 --> 04:56.960
Yeah.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.560
Yeah.
Just like in Vietnam.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.280
Men with guns everywhere.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.280
It's a frightening way to live.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.960
People have to learn
to protect themselves.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.960
The cops aren't always going
to be there when you need them.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.480
Any new threats from Nick Moats?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.120
Not since he called me here.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.120
It doesn't mean it's over yet.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.840
After Westphall,
rounds with Axelrod again

05:21.840 --> 05:23.240
is going to be a sea cruise.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.720
I know what you mean.
But, we got him in trouble last time.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.520
Carol. He admitted
the bad call was his fault.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.480
Face it, some people are
just born to be mud rugs.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.080
Morning.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.080
                             Morning.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
Morning. Let's start with...

05:35.080 --> 05:37.040
Mrs Rosen, windshield facial?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.680
No, smart guy.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.680
Mr Franklin, 3223, emphysema.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.760
What are you waiting for?
Let's move it!

06:02.240 --> 06:05.640
You look like you've been
slam-dunked.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.600
Oh man, I drew graveyard
and I'm whipped.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.000
I see you're a PA today.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.360
PI.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.160
    What?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.840
    What?
Private investigator.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.760
I'm gonna find the mercy killer.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.760
But Shirley Daniels did it, she gave
some old lady a shot in the heart.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.640
Hey, I see they make tennis
rackets for shrimpolas!

06:23.640 --> 06:25.440
The second murder was committed

06:25.440 --> 06:27.600
after they sent Shirley
back to prison.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.720
According to the autopsy,
the killer used potassium chloride,

06:30.720 --> 06:33.560
instantly paralysing
the heart muscle.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.360
The same drug Dr Craig
uses doing bypass surgery.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.680
Wait a minute,
you're accusing Dr Craig?

06:38.680 --> 06:42.520
Wait a minute,
you're accusing Dr Craig?
Could be anyone with
access to a pharmacy locker.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.520
And I'm gonna find out who.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.560
OK, I'm done.
Hold still, hold still.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.200
Hurry up, Victor, it's my turn.
Tie me off.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.400
Always remember our wedding day
started with a romantic blood test.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.360
When these results come
back from the lab,

06:55.360 --> 06:57.360
I'll go buy the marriage licence. Ow!

06:57.360 --> 06:59.080
After tonight's dirty deed

06:59.080 --> 07:01.600
is done, and we're officially
espoused, then we'll go public.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.280
is done, and we're officially
espoused, then we'll go public.
Oh, I can't wait.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.000
Me neither. Oh.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm gonna be late for OR.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.520
Oh, come on now.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.920
Victor. You're the greatest.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.920
Oh, this attention is
giving me a swell head.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.040
Bill, you got an
extra blast of Desenex?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.080
Go buy your own.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.080
Testy.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.640
You know, I'm wondering what
I should get Lucy and Ehrlich.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.560
It's a toss-up between a juicer,
or a lava lamp.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.640
Well, Victor already has a lava lamp.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.680
Besides, I don't think the
two of them have tied the knot.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.040
Besides, I don't think the
two of them have tied the knot.
I do.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.720
Well, why would Victor belly up again
after his 16 day wonder with Roberta?

07:38.720 --> 07:41.720
You know what they say
about second marriages.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.440
The triumph of
optimism over experience.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.440
All this relationship talk
is making me hivey. Got to go.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.960
&lt; See you.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.800
Roxanne! I thought we
had some hurry up surgery?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.840
Roxanne! I thought we
had some hurry up surgery?
We do.
I'll meet you there in a few, OK?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.600
Uh-huh.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.120
Gonna be late for rounds.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.640
Gonna be late for rounds.
Chandler. How have you been?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.240
                OK.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.440
I've missed you lately.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.760
                     What's going on?

08:04.760 --> 08:06.560
                     What's going on?
Well, I'm all keyed up.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.440
I'm about to try something.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.280
I have a 23 week pregnancy.
The ultrasound shows that

08:11.280 --> 08:14.400
the bladder's not filling, so the
urine's backed up to the kidneys.

08:14.400 --> 08:18.280
The baby's dying. The only chance
for a survival is foetal surgery.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.400
                     Out of the womb?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.560
                     Out of the womb?
The parents want the baby badly.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.160
It's a rare procedure. I mean, there
haven't been a lot of successes.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.880
It's a rare procedure. I mean, there
haven't been a lot of successes.
I know.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.440
I got pre-op jitters.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.120
Yeah, and you
came to me for a pep talk?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.000
             Rah rah, go Roxanne?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.280
                 Forget it.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.400
Just because
we're not living together,

08:37.400 --> 08:39.360
you can't give me
some support when I need some?

08:39.360 --> 08:43.360
you can't give me
some support when I need some?
Roxanne, you told me you love me,
but you can't make a commitment, OK?

08:43.799 --> 08:47.080
Can't make a commitment but
you want me to be here for  you?

08:47.080 --> 08:51.080
            It doesn't work that way.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.400
  Poor Mr Flack, he won't let go.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.360
If I ever get that bad,
I hope someone

09:08.360 --> 09:10.080
remembers to turn off the machines.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
Well, at least he's DNR,
so we won't have to code him.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Nurse.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.160
Nurse.
        Yes, Miss Lazarus?

09:15.160 --> 09:18.720
Why is my brother being
made to feed himself?

09:18.720 --> 09:21.960
We should go outside.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.680
Where are you going?

09:23.680 --> 09:27.680
Where are you going?
I'll be right back.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.920
Thomas is still very feeble from his
gall bladder surgery last Thursday.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.880
Yes, but your brother is
perfectly capable of feeding himself.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.200
It's your job.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.600
And your duty.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.240
Mr Lazarus should be encouraged

09:42.240 --> 09:44.720
to play a vital role
in his own recovery.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.880
All last week,
nurses shirked their obligation.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.200
Well, fine. I shall employ

09:50.200 --> 09:53.960
a private nursing agency
to come in and look after Thomas.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.280
Miss Lazarus, it's...

09:55.280 --> 09:59.000
Let her hire a practical nurse.
We need the extra help.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.320
She's over-protecting him.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.960
If she doesn't let him,
he's not going to get better.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.960
If she doesn't let him,
he's not going to get better.
What are you, his guardian angel?
Drop it, Helen.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.720
Cynthia. Are you doing OK?

10:14.720 --> 10:16.760
I think so. How about you?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.200
I'm ready to dipsy-do.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.720
Remember, leave my womb
a little neater than you found it.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.880
I was a girl scout.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.880
I'll see you inside.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.040
Hey, glad you two could make it.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.240
Thanks for springing us
from our rotation.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.880
You two are rock steady and I
didn't want any butter fingers.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.360
Foetal surgery.
Read about it in JAMA.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.960
This is the game plan.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.160
We lift the foetus out of the womb
and expose the kidneys to relieve

10:45.160 --> 10:47.880
the pressure. Then we sew
the foetus back into the womb.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.240
Three months from now,
at full term, the mother returns.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.840
We deliver by Caesarean.
Any questions?

10:52.840 --> 10:54.880
In and out, that's what
foetal surgery is all about.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.880
Who's the anaesthesiologist?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.840
Who's the anaesthesiologist?
                           Dr Morgan.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.640
I'd better go look over his shoulder
and talk Cynthia through twilight.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.480
I'll come back and scrub up after.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.800
What's all the mystery?
Why wasn't this operation posted?

11:04.800 --> 11:08.240
Got me.
Sure is exciting, though.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.240
I hope your malpractice is paid up!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.280
LONG MONOTONE BEEP

11:29.280 --> 11:31.720
Mr Ferrara.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.440
85% occlusion.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.440
Arteries like cannoli.
Up his medication to 75mgs.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.360
             Morning.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.800
             Morning.
Say, did you speak to your friend?

11:41.800 --> 11:45.000
Tickets, remember? Disney on Ice.
Barbara's all revved up.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.440
Must be getting goofy, Mark,

11:46.440 --> 11:48.480
I completely forgot about it.
I'll call him.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.080
What's the latest from the HMO?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.840
Oh, relax, Donald.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.400
Don't get your boxers in a knot.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.840
Magna Fujiyama has promised
to announce their plans

11:55.840 --> 11:57.640
for St Eligius
by the end of the day.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.800
Mark!

11:59.800 --> 12:03.800
Gene?

12:08.880 --> 12:12.040
Um, Donald Westphall, you remember
Gene Galecki?

12:12.040 --> 12:13.120
Sure do.

12:13.120 --> 12:17.120
Yvonne Galecki.
Stephen's...

12:17.160 --> 12:19.160
My daughter in law.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.320
Mark didn't tell me you
were back on your feet.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.440
I didn't know.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.440
Vonnie? You recognise Dr Craig?

12:31.240 --> 12:35.240
I'm sorry.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.080
POP MUSIC PLAYS

12:43.640 --> 12:47.640
Any new rumours about what the
HMO plans to do with St Eligius?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.960
            Magna Fuyi.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.520
Let's just say killing their BP

12:51.520 --> 12:54.680
of medical facilities
wasn't exactly body politic.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.760
I mean, just give
Auschlander the heave-ho.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.280
Well, thanks to them,
the hospital credit union

12:59.280 --> 13:01.560
suddenly wants me
to pay off all my loans.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.200
Ho ho, you got the moolah?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.920
No. But since Robert served notice
he wants half my future earnings,

13:06.920 --> 13:08.560
  he can have half my debts too.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.680
Well, that's the fare
in A Streetcar Named Divorce.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.080
Should have thought of that
before you just said "I do" to Lucy.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.200
I'll be happy to accept your wedding
present, but we are not married.

13:18.200 --> 13:18.640
                      Are too.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.240
                      Are too.
Am not.

13:19.240 --> 13:19.440
                      Are too.
Am not.
                    Are too.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
                      Are too.
Am not.
                    Are too.
Am not!

13:20.440 --> 13:22.760
Folks. Let's keep the chit-chat
down to a minimum.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.200
We've got a delicate operation
ahead of us.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.400
Pulling a kid out of mom
during the wash cycle

13:27.400 --> 13:29.640
and stuffing it back in for the
final rinse, brand new territory.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.680
and stuffing it back in for the
final rinse, brand new territory.
And we are about to enter it.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.400
So I need everyone's full attention.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.320
                   Scalpel.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.400
                   Scalpel.
(Am not.)

13:36.400 --> 13:40.120
                  Are too.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.600
That's number three.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.000
 Another terminal patient euthanized.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.120
Found a syringe beside the bed,
potassium chloride.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.680
Detective Zeto, can I talk to you?

13:48.680 --> 13:51.400
Detective Zeto, can I talk to you?
Wayne.
What the hell is going on here?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.160
Mercy killing hit the trifecta.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.480
No, no, I mean this. This letter
from HMO about our health plan?

13:56.480 --> 13:59.760
I got that notice. More junk mail.
Tossed it without reading.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.600
Yeah, we'll you'd better go through
the trash and read the fine print.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.920
First, the credit union.
Now, Magna Fujiyama is trying to

14:05.920 --> 14:07.480
cancel our medical coverage.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.680
You see, after examining all
the facts, I think I have

14:10.680 --> 14:12.000
a pretty good idea
who the killer is.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.400
a pretty good idea
who the killer is.
   Yeah?

14:13.400 --> 14:16.960
A nurse. Access to the meds. On
duty at the time of all the murders.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.880
Chronic drug problem recently.
I think it's Julie McPhail.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.840
So do half the people who work
with her. Only she's not the one.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.680
So do half the people who work
with her. Only she's not the one.
Oh?

14:24.680 --> 14:26.760
The woman we just took away
was killed at 10:30.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.720
One of my men checked
out McPhail's whereabouts.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.800
She was doing an EKG on
some patient two floors away.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.960
She was doing an EKG on
some patient two floors away.
Are you sure?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.400
She turned in the read-outs.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
Which has the time of
the test printed on it.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.400
10:29.
Couldn't be in both places at once.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
      All right, Mr Lazarus.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.520
Time for your X-ray.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.440
I don't want to.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.080
Oh, come on, don't you want
to get out of this room?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.120
Take a spin around the hall?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.000
Come on, help me. Work with me.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.280
Oh, can't move.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.560
What's this?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.280
It's a transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulator.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.280
It's a non-narcotic way to
control post-op pain. OK then.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.520
Lot's of new gizmos since
I was full time in hospital.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.520
All right.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.400
I'll have your dentures cleaned
and ready for you, Mr Lazarus.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.880
I'm the new LPN his sister hired.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.920
Looks about over for him.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.520
People like that
are my bread and butter.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.520
The longer they hold on,
the more work for me.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.960
The longer they hold on,
the more work for me.
Mr Lazarus can clean
his own dentures.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.280
His sister was pretty specific.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.520
Grooming, feeding, massage.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.280
Turtles, my favourite.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.720
You have an obligation
to help your patients.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.160
Oh, please!
I finally got out of the full-time

15:44.160 --> 15:47.800
angel of mercy racket, because
I finally saw through all the bull.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.800
Overworked, underpaid,
and barely recognised.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.520
Doctors treat you like crap.
Patients treat you even worse.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.280
The more you care,
the less it matters.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.440
Nursing?

16:00.440 --> 16:03.680
"A glamorous profession"!?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.320
Thank you.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.040
John Rish is our top neurologist.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.760
I want him to get a thorough
assessment of Yvonne's condition.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.160
Yvonne's been making slow
but steady progress

16:14.160 --> 16:15.520
since she came out of the coma.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.400
We've been working with her.
Exercising the muscles.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.320
You've made a real good
progress this last month.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.520
She, er...

16:23.520 --> 16:25.400
doesn't remember some.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.160
Me and her mom had to...

16:27.160 --> 16:31.160
tell her about Stephen and her and
the accident, what happened and all.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.440
Where is my baby?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.080
With Ellen.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.080
Stephen's mother.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.720
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

16:38.720 --> 16:40.040
You have to see
another doctor, Vonnie.

16:40.040 --> 16:44.040
You have to see
another doctor, Vonnie.
When can I see my baby?

16:47.760 --> 16:50.160
OK, it's your job
to gain the patient's trust.

16:50.160 --> 16:54.160
If he lied to you,
you would probably show
no credibility in your approach.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.360
Griffin.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.120
Mrs Bruni.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.319
Repeat blood tests showed
abnormal LFTs.

17:04.319 --> 17:07.640
She also has ulcerative colitis.
We performed a liver biopsy.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.880
Schedule her for a barium. You
can fit her in early tomorrow.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.119
Er, I'd hoped to arrange
that on an out-patient basis.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.920
I plan to send her home. She's got
the bridge club coming over and...

17:16.920 --> 17:19.160
Mrs Bruni just had a liver biopsy.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.079
She's supposed to lie flat on
her back for at least eight hours.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.319
Not to mention which, I'm in charge
of this team. Low-levels like you

17:25.319 --> 17:28.640
do not make major therapeutic
decisions without my approval.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.080
We've got 42 patients. There's not
enough time for non-critical testing.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.520
If you were smarter and
more organised, you'd find the time.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.680
It's always the dumb kids who
are overworked, isn't it, Novino?

17:37.680 --> 17:39.760
Sorry.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.080
Ought to be.
Wrong diagnosis. Bad judgment.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.080
You two really stink.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.080
All right, come on, one more,
one more, come on, come on.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.360
Push, push, pop a vein.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.360
There we go. That's power lifting.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.400
Thought you were supposed to be beat?

18:01.400 --> 18:04.800
Dr Morrison needed a spotter.
How's your murder investigation?

18:04.800 --> 18:05.880
What have you got to do with it?

18:05.880 --> 18:08.400
What have you got to do with it?
He's the house dick.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.040
     Now that McPhail's in the clear,

18:10.040 --> 18:12.880
I know who the killer has to be.
Got motive, opportunity...

18:12.880 --> 18:13.440
Who?

18:13.440 --> 18:16.080
Who?
     Vijay Cochar, anaesthesiologist.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.960
Access to every drug ever invented.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.600
  Plus, he believes in reincarnation.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.400
Maybe he wanted to get
the terminal patients a head start

18:23.400 --> 18:24.520
         on the next life.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.400
Listen. How do we know it's not you?

18:26.400 --> 18:30.400
Cos I'd have started by
killing big dumb orderlies!

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Paged Dr Markell three times
about the pancreatitis in 3401.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.400
Never comes in. The jerk
practises his medicine by phone.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.680
Oh, Julia, Mrs Bernal's
grandchildren are coming over.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.120
Would you make sure
she's presentable?

18:44.120 --> 18:46.000
Would you make sure
she's presentable?
                    How do I do that?

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
              Personality transplant?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.320
Oh, Paulette!

18:52.320 --> 18:56.160
I've been trying to reach
you all day. Mr Lazarus.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.760
His sister called me this morning.
Angry woman.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.120
Yes.
Now she's hired a care giver,

19:01.120 --> 19:03.000
and neither of them
will listen to me.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.040
The hospital is changing hands.
I have a full surgical schedule,

19:06.040 --> 19:09.000
plus my responsibility as
director of medical education.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.480
I cannot take part in
the troubles of the ward.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.520
Yes. But Mr Lazarus
should be further along.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.080
In my opinion, this patient
is doing fine medically.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.080
That's all we need to know.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.440
MUSIC PLAYS

19:22.440 --> 19:24.600
Through the abdominal wall.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.640
Just about into the amniotic sac.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.640
Barely filled. The foetus
isn't putting out urine at all.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.720
This little fella doesn't mind
us interrupting his siesta.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.960
Let's turn down the beat.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.280
Even though the baby's anesthetized
through of the mother's system,

19:42.280 --> 19:46.000
we want to make our presence
felt as little as possible.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.840
I wonder if the kid will
have any memory of this.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.520
We're in.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.320
Jackie, pull back on the retractor.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.920
Victor, hang close for the hand off.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.440
Victor, hang close for the hand off.
How much pressure do I use?

19:55.440 --> 19:57.000
Just enough. Snug.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.800
We'll leave the upper half
of the baby inside the mother.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.800
Contact with the air can damage
the umbilical cord. Everybody ready?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.320
Contact with the air can damage
the umbilical cord. Everybody ready?
All set.  OK.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.320
Here we go.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.240
I have to uncoil the legs.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.560
             Amazing.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.560
I'll say.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.680
You mean they just showed up,
no telephone call, nothing?

20:17.680 --> 20:20.880
Ellen, I'm as surprised as you.
Come on.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.720
    Well, is Yvonne really all right?

20:22.720 --> 20:25.120
Rish is running tests right now.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.560
She seems sluggish
at times, but otherwise...

20:27.560 --> 20:31.480
Driving here, I just kept
wondering what my life would be
like without this little girl.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.240
When we brought Barbara home,

20:33.240 --> 20:35.360
you and I discussed what would
happen if Yvonne got better.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.800
you and I discussed what would
happen if Yvonne got better.
            It was that easy for you?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.720
Ellen. That's not fair.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.720
             I won't give Barbara up.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.240
Why don't we take a little walk?

21:30.560 --> 21:33.120
It seems a long time ago,
you and me,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.600
watching over Vonnie
after the accident.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.960
  Her lying there, all banged up.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.440
You say this fellow is top-notch?

21:41.440 --> 21:43.200
One of the finest in Boston.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.320
Good.
I only want the best for my girl.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.600
We all want the best
for our children.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.880
And grandchildren.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.320
Vonnie's come too far
to have her slip back now.

21:53.320 --> 21:57.240
Gene.
She's made remarkable progress.

21:57.240 --> 22:01.240
But your daughter may always have
certain shortcomings, limitations.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.440
You don't sound
like you did back then.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.160
When I lost hope, you encouraged me,

22:06.160 --> 22:09.240
you made me believe that Vonnie
would come out of that coma.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.840
Yes, I know.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.680
But over a year?

22:12.680 --> 22:16.480
That length of time could affect
the completeness of her recovery.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.920
Do you think she's ready
to care for Barbara?

22:18.920 --> 22:20.840
Patty and me will
be there to help her.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.320
And when my girl sees
her own little one,

22:23.320 --> 22:25.640
it will give her
something more to fight for.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
When is Mrs Craig
bringing the baby around?

22:33.440 --> 22:36.200
      Donald! Help! Give me a hand. &gt;

22:36.200 --> 22:37.640
Helen?  Oh.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.320
Who are these people?

22:38.320 --> 22:39.600
Who are these people?
          Psych patients.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.360
Someone left the stairwell door open
to the 6th floor ward.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.520
Oh great(!) Come on. It's all right.
Any others get out?

22:46.520 --> 22:48.960
Yeah, about 10 or 15.
They're all over the building.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.120
The inmates run the asylum.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.680
       That's exactly the way I feel.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.120
     This whole place is topsy-turvy.

22:55.120 --> 22:59.120
Everything from doors left unlocked
to patients being murdered.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.960
I look around, nobody seems
to care any more, including

23:03.960 --> 23:07.000
the nursing staff. It's like
they've forgotten why we're here.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.160
They're just punching in
and punching out.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.640
When I was growing up
in this neighbourhood,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.720
this hospital was full of
friends, families.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.600
McCabe knew everybody that
was walking through that door.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.640
Now we have HMO, and that's treating
all of us - doctors,

23:19.640 --> 23:23.280
patients, nurses, everybody -
like commodities.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.880
Oh, when I was in charge here,

23:24.880 --> 23:27.400
I had everybody moving
in a positive direction.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.840
Unity, autonomy, dedication.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.320
Found two.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.320
OK, I'll take them from here.
Thanks, Doctor.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.040
I don't know, Donald, maybe it's me.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.720
Fighting to make my life
mean something.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.480
Put purpose back in my work.

23:43.480 --> 23:46.640
Well, you were a pretty
good head nurse, you know.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.640
Maybe you should try
and get your job back.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.800
I've got to insert a stent,

23:53.800 --> 23:57.440
which will allow urine to
enter into the amniotic sac.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.080
Not whizzing for four months?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.800
I can barely make it
through a large iced tea.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.600
I can barely make it
through a large iced tea.
             Cautery.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.720
I've never worked on
anything so delicate.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.720
How soon after birth can
the blockage be permanently repaired?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.840
Right away.
Even though we are able to perform

24:10.840 --> 24:14.200
this procedure, most defects
are best treated post partum.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.560
Uh-oh. Umbilical cord's sneaking
out. I need more moist lab pads.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.760
I'm almost finished.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.960
Saline.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.400
Pull back on the retractor.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.560
Toss in a rattle,
while the door's open?

24:28.560 --> 24:31.200
(LAUGHS)

24:31.200 --> 24:35.200
Hand me baby.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.680
We've operated on a child
that's not even born yet.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.280
Giving it a chance of life
when there wasn't one before.

24:46.280 --> 24:50.280
And he's living out man's greatest
obsession, going back to the womb.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.560
Sleep tight.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.560
I'm so relieved you're not married.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.960
                    Why!

25:01.960 --> 25:03.840
             I mean, suppose we were?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.760
          What's so bad about Victor?

25:05.760 --> 25:07.480
He's OK.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.080
You two are so much alike.

25:09.080 --> 25:12.240
I always thought marriage partners
should complement each other,

25:12.240 --> 25:14.720
bring out the best,
soften the worst.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.120
You and Victor are
like brother and sister.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.200
                 So we're both blond?

25:19.200 --> 25:23.080
And abrasive.
And loud. And aggressive.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.680
Kevin is worried about
me walking home alone at night.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.440
He offered to buy me a stun gun.

25:29.440 --> 25:33.440
The weapon is no larger than
a pack of cigarettes. 45,000 volts.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.840
Well, I don't blame your husband
for wanting you to carry something.

25:36.840 --> 25:40.160
Protect yourself against
the muggers and sickos.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.200
I want something with
a little more firepower.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.560
&lt; You were wrong about McPhail, and
you were wrong about Vijay Cochar.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.040
How did I know he's been out
with Ganges gastritis?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.000
So what make you think
you're right this time?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.840
He's got to be the one.
The on-call schedule

25:52.840 --> 25:54.800
jives with all the murders.
Found one of the bodies.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.440
That still doesn't...

25:55.440 --> 25:58.360
That still doesn't...
And he was on a shaky no code
a few months ago.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.360
Griffin's the one, I'm telling you.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.160
Can Magna Fujiyama really
cancel our health insurance?

26:05.160 --> 26:06.160
Can Magna Fujiyama really
cancel our health insurance?
No, of course not.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.600
They also said Custer
would never lose his hair.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.400
Speaking of which,
there's a curly in yours.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.000
Friend of mine was working
in a hospital in Pittsburgh.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.240
The place was bought by a HMO.
They closed it down for six months

26:18.240 --> 26:20.640
to remodel. It cost
him an extra year residency.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.560
That might not be such a bad idea in
Elliot's case, take him down a peg.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.560
That might not be such a bad idea in
Elliot's case, take him down a peg.
Hm. See you later.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.120
Carol, may I assume
you're sitting here

26:44.120 --> 26:46.800
because you've gotten Mr Petski's
CBC back from the lab?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.640
because you've gotten Mr Petski's
CBC back from the lab?
I thought I'd wait until after lunch.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.640
And what if, by then, the patient
makes Mrs Petski a widow?

26:52.800 --> 26:54.360
The man's in for
internal haemorrhoids.

26:54.360 --> 26:58.360
The man's in for
internal haemorrhoids.
Stranger things have happened.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.240
So, Elliot.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.960
What's happened to you? Your ego's
gotten as big as your bathtub ring.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.440
What's happened to you? Your ego's
gotten as big as your bathtub ring.
Did you check Mrs Garraway
after rounds?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.600
Then I guess you don't have
time to sit around

27:10.600 --> 27:14.600
making smart comments, do you?

27:21.960 --> 27:23.640
Why did you kill those
patients, Dr Griffin?

27:23.640 --> 27:26.080
Why did you kill those
patients, Dr Griffin?
Somebody ring your bell, Hawkins?

27:26.080 --> 27:27.920
Find a motive, got you nailed.
You're the mercy killer.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.800
Find a motive, got you nailed.
You're the mercy killer.
Out of my way.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.080
Wait a minute.

27:31.080 --> 27:35.080
Wasn't your mother sick for
a long time before she passed away?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.360
I've never liked you, Hawkins.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.440
Yeah? Well, I do.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.720
You mess with him and
you gotta deal with me.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.720
Just ask Wade where I was when
the first victim got popped.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.400
You left word for me, Donald?

27:57.400 --> 28:01.400
You left word for me, Donald?
Yeah, come on in.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.440
We're a little puzzled
why you didn't clear

28:04.440 --> 28:06.320
the foetal surgery
for Cynthia Adler.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.360
I wasn't aware I needed
anyone's blessings?

28:09.360 --> 28:11.600
Is that why you didn't post the
operation on the surgical board?

28:11.600 --> 28:14.160
Is that why you didn't post the
operation on the surgical board?
 I was trying to avoid looky-loos.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.160
Yeah, and you pulled Ehrlich and
Wade from their regular rotation.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.640
I'm the OB department head.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.880
That doesn't give you carte blanche.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.200
Roxanne, you know
it's a risky procedure at best.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.000
It's almost experimental.
Now I think Paulette, myself,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.920
Mark Craig, someone should have
been apprised of the situation.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.440
If I had, you wouldn't have
let me do the procedure.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.840
So that's the reason
for the secrecy?

28:34.840 --> 28:38.840
I kept it a secret because
I didn't want the interference.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.240
The endless meetings,
the bureaucracy.

28:42.240 --> 28:46.240
I wanted to make a decision, do the
operation and take responsibility.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.680
I'm sick and tired of all the
second guessing, the red tape.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.680
So just let me run my
department the way I see fit.

28:54.920 --> 28:58.880
Or you can find
yourself another yes-woman.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.600
DOOR SLAMS

29:01.600 --> 29:05.600
MONOTONE BEEP FROM THE MACHINE

29:19.400 --> 29:21.400
            Mr Lazarus?

29:21.400 --> 29:24.280
Did you see anyone in here
with this patient?

29:24.280 --> 29:27.360
No. The machine just kept going.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.960
His chest moving up and down.

29:29.960 --> 29:33.960
Wouldn't let him stop breathing.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.400
Is your private nurse
still at dinner?

29:41.400 --> 29:45.400
I'm tired.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.760
I know you are.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.520
I don't want my life
to end like his.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.040
Just running out.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.320
I used to be a high-school teacher.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.080
And then, I got ill.

30:01.080 --> 30:05.080
They took me out of the classroom,
and cut me down to nothing.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.600
You can't give up just because
someone says you're too old.

30:12.840 --> 30:16.840
You've been ill. You've got to work
very hard to get your strength back.

30:18.040 --> 30:22.040
Medicine can do just so much.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.120
I'll help you.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.320
Lucy and I are just good friends.
We get along.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.480
That would have changed
if you'd gotten married.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.640
That would have changed
if you'd gotten married.
I don't know. Might have lasted.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.560
                  Let's be realistic.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.760
We both have seen
the downside of betrothal.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.120
Yeah.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.680
Had a peek at the upside too.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.560
         Some of us peeked too early!

30:42.560 --> 30:46.560
 It's time to get Cynthia downstairs.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.240
     I think you did the right thing.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.000
Stay single and stay together.
Hi, how are you?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.400
My stomach, it hurts. It's terrible.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.200
Victor, she's had two contractions,
seven minutes apart.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.920
Looks like ruptured membranes,
lost amniotic fluid.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.760
Get Turner back up here, stat.
Just hang on.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.760
Get Turner back up here, stat.
Just hang on.
No, it's too early!

31:05.760 --> 31:07.200
Ellen?

31:07.200 --> 31:09.280
Ellen.

31:09.280 --> 31:13.280
Mark, hush.
Barbara's still down for a na...

31:14.040 --> 31:18.040
Wake her up.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.680
GUN CLICKS

31:50.120 --> 31:52.800
Excuse me!

31:52.800 --> 31:54.040
Get outta the way!

31:54.040 --> 31:56.080
What happened?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.240
Lost foetal heart tones.
Trying to locate with ultrasound.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.680
Lost foetal heart tones.
Trying to locate with ultrasound.
I'll do it.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.840
BP's 105 over 80. Pulse is rapid.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.920
BP's 105 over 80. Pulse is rapid.
Still having contractions.
Last one was seven minutes ago.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.560
I've already upped
her magnesium sulphate.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.920
I've already upped
her magnesium sulphate.
Feels like I should push!

32:07.920 --> 32:10.600
Don't. Just breathe.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.920
Where's the heartbeat?

32:11.920 --> 32:14.960
Call upstairs, tell them
to prep an OR, stat.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.680
Oh, God,
please don't let this happen.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.320
Oh, God,
please don't let this happen.
We have to take you back to surgery.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.480
No! My baby... Don't!

32:20.480 --> 32:23.200
Alert NIC, we'll deliver
by C-section.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.080
 Roxanne, the foetus isn't viable.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.440
I just can't stand here!

32:26.440 --> 32:27.760
What's happening?

32:27.760 --> 32:30.080
Ten milligrams valium.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.880
I... I did everything I could.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.800
Save my baby!

32:33.800 --> 32:35.040
I did, I tried!
I thought I could do it.

32:35.040 --> 32:39.040
I did, I tried!
I thought I could do it.
No-o-o!

32:39.560 --> 32:43.560
No-o-o!

32:50.840 --> 32:52.960
Have you seen
Mrs Cardona's chart?

32:52.960 --> 32:55.120
                Business or pleasure?

32:55.120 --> 32:58.080
While Doctor Auschlander is out of
town, I'm keeping a daily record

32:58.080 --> 33:00.040
of all his patients.
What is this?

33:00.040 --> 33:03.720
Why, that's a treasure map(!)
What does it look like?

33:03.720 --> 33:07.400
An EKG? But Mrs Cardona's
not in for a heart problem.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.120
             So, we won't charge her.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.360
She doesn't have
a pacemaker, either.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.480
See this blip?
That's a paced beat.

33:14.480 --> 33:18.480
Goody(!) But I don't have time
for PAs or people, too.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.840
Hey, Elliot.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.160
Hey, Elliot.
Yeah?

33:26.160 --> 33:27.320
Remember Mrs Brodie?

33:27.320 --> 33:28.360
Remember Mrs Brodie?
Yeah.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.240
I overheard her say she was going
to speak to Donny Boy about you.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.240
Great, I could use help getting
back in Westphall's good graces.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.000
This is a complaint.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.440
This is a complaint.
What?! What did I ever do to her?

33:37.440 --> 33:40.280
Nothing. She felt you were
too hard on Griffin and Novino.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.800
I'm just trying to show
that I could be a leader,

33:42.800 --> 33:45.040
and not a squeaky toy.
It works for Dr Craig.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.600
You want to be like Dr Craig?

33:47.600 --> 33:51.040
Well, no.
Except for sleeping with Mrs Craig.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.400
Look, Elliot, it's OK
to beat up on the first years,

33:53.400 --> 33:55.080
but you've got to know when
to let up. Look how he treated you.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.400
but you've got to know when
to let up. Look how he treated you.
Yeah, like garbage.

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
And see what a bad doctor you are?

34:02.280 --> 34:04.160
Mark, how could you bring them here?

34:04.160 --> 34:07.240
Ellen, I had to.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.520
We could get a court order.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.639
Ellen...
Yvonne is Barbara's mother.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.000
We're the grandparents.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.880
We'll have a chance to see her.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.280
Bring her back here to visit.

34:18.280 --> 34:22.280
Mark?  Come on.

34:34.600 --> 34:38.600
Barbara?

34:52.760 --> 34:56.760
She's beautiful.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.440
She has Stephen's hands.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.760
She's in custody.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.760
Let's line up counsel to
be present for questioning.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.600
               Why?

35:32.600 --> 35:33.880
Why what?

35:33.880 --> 35:35.120
              Why'd you do it?

35:35.120 --> 35:38.920
I didn't.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.880
    What about the EKG you turned in?

35:40.880 --> 35:44.880
Just proves I was somewhere else
when the woman died.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.200
Actually,
it puts you right in her room.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.000
Mrs Cardona's EKG
shows a pacemaker.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
Mrs Cardona doesn't have a pacemaker.
But the woman who died did.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.960
  So, you took a reading from her

35:58.960 --> 36:02.160
to show time, injected the
potassium chloride and killed her.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.680
Then you ran up two floors,
put Mrs Cardona's name

36:05.680 --> 36:09.680
on the strip and gave it to the
floor nurse to establish an alibi.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.360
Smart. But so what?

36:12.360 --> 36:15.200
          Just wonder why you did it.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.720
I didn't.

36:18.720 --> 36:22.720
But I approve.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.080
People should be allowed
to die with grace.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.760
With dignity.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.760
Without pain. The end of a happy,
full life shouldn't be senility.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.480
A coma.

36:33.480 --> 36:37.480
A family's life savings shouldn't be
wiped out because a doctor decides

36:37.840 --> 36:41.840
to keep some patient alive
on an expensive machine!

36:43.080 --> 36:47.080
I do not believe
in life at any price.

36:47.480 --> 36:51.480
Some things are worse than death.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.360
That's why.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.720
Let's go.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.280
KNOCK ON DOOR

37:05.280 --> 37:07.480
KNOCK ON DOOR
Yep.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.200
Dr Westphall, you wanted to see me?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.360
Dr Westphall, you wanted to see me?
No.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.560
          What I mean is,

37:13.560 --> 37:16.120
you will want to see me
after you get the complaint.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.880
Elliot, don't do this to me now.

37:18.880 --> 37:22.680
Dr Westphall, my entire life,
my father beat me up verbally.

37:22.680 --> 37:26.680
And I hated him for it.
And what do I do when I'm boss?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.720
       I act just like him.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.800
     I realise that, you know,

37:30.800 --> 37:33.800
he was probably treating me that way
because he was insecure,

37:33.800 --> 37:37.760
just like me. But I've learned
my lesson. It won't happen again.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.720
I'm glad to hear that, Elliot.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.960
But right now,

37:41.960 --> 37:45.400
I swear to you, I don't care a bit.
Something's happened.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.600
Dr Westphall,
do you want to share it?

37:48.600 --> 37:51.560
You'll find out soon enough.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.560
      Yes, sir.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.920
Lucy. We have to talk.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.600
                    OK.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.640
You've lost control.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.200
You don't know your staff.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.760
We've become handmaidens
for doctors again.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.760
I'm going to become head nurse
if it's the last thing I do.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.480
                You're right.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.480
                You're so right.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.760
      You can have your old job back.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.880
      You can have your old job back.
I can?

38:26.880 --> 38:29.480
Mmm-hmm.
Just don't get too attached, though.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.760
You have only one week
to save the world.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.040
I don't understand.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.880
            Well, I got my pink slip.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.160
              Here's yours.

38:40.160 --> 38:44.160
            The HMO has fired us all.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

38:54.520 --> 38:56.920
Never rains but it pours, huh?

38:56.920 --> 38:58.200
       I'm a pitiful thing, Chandler.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.600
       I'm a pitiful thing, Chandler.
You had to try.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.920
Baby would have died anyway.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.800
I should have saved him.
I thought that I could.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.600
Look... Come on, listen.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.400
It'll be OK.

39:13.400 --> 39:17.000
I'm thinking of taking some
time off and getting away.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
I got some vacation time coming up.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.880
I'm not talking about a vacation.
I'm talking about leaving medicine.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.560
Look, you had a setback.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.560
Listen to me. Time is slipping away.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.120
I just want to
put on the brakes a little.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.760
Do something else with
the second half of my life.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.520
I don't know what.

39:41.520 --> 39:45.520
Run for Congress, sell rugs,
go to a matinee... Just cool out.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.800
Refresh my spirit.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.000
And the school, the hard work,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.400
the residency - you're
willing to throw all that away?

39:55.400 --> 39:58.480
I don't have to be
a doctor to be happy.

39:58.480 --> 40:02.480
I haven't heard you mention us in
your list of things to think about.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.440
 You still have to prove yourself.

40:11.480 --> 40:15.480
If you go away with me to nowhere,
you'll end up hating me for it.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.800
Yeah, the Magna Fujiyama people
said they'd tell us

40:42.800 --> 40:46.600
their plans by the end of the day.

40:46.600 --> 40:50.600
I just got word.
They're closing the hospital.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.880
And it just hit me.

40:53.880 --> 40:57.200
This is the end of a relationship
that's been going on

40:57.200 --> 40:59.800
since I was six years old.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.760
I was here when those doors
were first opened.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.280
I remember, clear as
a bell, a fella was hurt.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.000
They had him in the back of a truck.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.560
The men were carrying him in,
I opened the doors for them.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.560
His blood was all over
the floor, right here.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.680
I never dreamt
I would close those doors.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.160
                Buy you a drink?

41:19.160 --> 41:20.840
                Buy you a drink?
Sure!

41:20.840 --> 41:24.280
I'd like to hear more about
the stories of the hospital.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.880
I'll take the drink,
but let's talk about anything else.

41:25.880 --> 41:29.880
I'll take the drink,
but let's talk about anything else.
                    Got it.

41:31.000 --> 41:31.760
Dr Westphall?

41:31.760 --> 41:32.600
Dr Westphall?
Yeah?

41:32.600 --> 41:34.480
Dr Westphall?
Yeah?
You're nipping my career in the bud.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.720
I had nothing to do with it,
we all got one.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.920
What am I gonna do?

41:37.920 --> 41:40.160
What am I gonna do?
Come and have a pot with us.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.560
Lose a job, gain a spouse.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.240
Pretty soon,
we'll be together forever.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.160
         Oh, do you have the licence?

41:47.160 --> 41:48.680
Right here in mister pocket.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.280
Did you remember to phone
the justice of the peace?

41:50.280 --> 41:51.760
Did you remember to phone
the justice of the peace?
                   Check.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.840
Well...

41:53.840 --> 41:55.120
                         Yeah.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.560
Just a matter of minutes.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.120
              We'll be married!

41:58.120 --> 41:58.720
Forever.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.000
Forever.
                     And ever.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.560
We're not gonna go through with it.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.880
We're not gonna go through with it.
                    No way.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.080
No.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.360
No.
                  No.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.920
       Not with us both out of a job.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.720
I don't know where I'll end up.
Maybe another city.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.160
I need a night alone
to think about things.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.040
I need a night alone
to think about things.
Me, too.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.320
         Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.480
         Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Right.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.600
                  Right.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.600
                  Right.
Night.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.920
Well, at least you
solved the murders.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.920
And the HMO killed my career.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.560
TOY PLAYS LULLABY

43:31.000 --> 43:34.960
                          It's quiet.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.960
Yeah, well...

43:37.960 --> 43:41.960
For once, Baskin isn't
banging around in the kitchen.

43:43.320 --> 43:47.320
That man eats at the oddest hours.

43:48.360 --> 43:52.360
          This is all my fault, Mark.

43:52.400 --> 43:56.400
I pushed you into bringing Barbara
home with us after she was born.

43:58.680 --> 44:02.480
She had no mother.

44:02.480 --> 44:06.160
She needed someone to care for her.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.680
We did that.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.680
   But I treated her as my own child.

44:16.240 --> 44:20.240
Well, so did I.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
All those missed opportunities
with Stephen.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.800
Must have thought I'd...

44:30.800 --> 44:34.800
make up for lost time with Barbara.

44:36.160 --> 44:40.160
There are no second chances, huh?

44:42.160 --> 44:46.160
Mark, why did we have only one child?

44:48.600 --> 44:51.160
            We stopped with one. Why?

44:51.160 --> 44:53.680
What does it matter now, Ellen?

44:53.680 --> 44:57.680
                     Oh, God...

44:58.120 --> 45:02.120
        Oh, Mark. When I was pregnant

45:02.520 --> 45:06.080
               or nursing...

45:06.080 --> 45:09.480
             My breasts full of milk,

45:09.480 --> 45:13.480
           my baby safe in my arms...

45:15.240 --> 45:19.240
                    I love you, Mark.

45:28.640 --> 45:53.000
