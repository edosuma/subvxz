- L... I don't know.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.900
He started convulsing
right after he took his meds.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.200
- How much lithium did you give him?
- Lith... No, he gets Thorazine.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.500
Thorazine? He's manic-depressive.
He doesn't need a sedative.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.700
I'm sorry.
I must've gotten them mixed up.

Look, set up a meeting with

Well, screw the D.A.
He's the one trying to pull a fast one.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.900
Let him read about
it in the paper.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.800
You sure that's a good idea?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.900
Playing chicken with the district attorney
of a major metropolitan city?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.800

See us go at it on the golf course.

Since... What?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.700
All part of the mojo

04:19.700 --> 04:22.100
Half the cases that cross our desk
are settled out on the links...

04:22.100 --> 04:24.000
before they ever make it to trial.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.600
Nine holes instead
of a jury of your peers.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.500
Just what the founding fathers
had in mind.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.300
Well, sometimes you gotta work
the system before it works you.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.500
That our new motto?

04:34.500 --> 04:38.100
Look, I know our move to Wolfram and Hart
hasn't been all flowers and candy.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.400
But we've been able to do some
serious good while we're here.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.400
Lives saved, disasters averted, with
all our fingers and souls still attached.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.300
End of the day, I'm thinkin'
we made the right choice.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.500
Maybe we made a mistake
comin' here.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.500
- What's goin' on?
- Parasite Eve, right on out the door.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.900
- You're firing her?
- Well, that's one option.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.700
A generous one, considering
she tried to kill you.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.700
Okay, first, the parasite she allegedly
sicced on you wasn't meant to be fatal.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.100
No. Just send you into
a permanent hallucinogenic coma.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.600
And what's with the "alleged"?
You don't believe I know it was her?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.300
It's not about what I believe.
It's about the evidence.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.700
This isn't a courtroom, Gunn. Things work
with a bit more immediacy in the real world.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.600
She's liaison to
the senior partners.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.800
You don't get to be that
without serious juice.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.800
Move against her without solid proof,
and it could end in a long, bloody fight.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.800
Okay, fine. I think I liked you better
when you just wanted to hit people.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.500
Rational thought.
It's an acquired taste.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.900
Wait a minute. So we're not gonna
snap Twiggy into little sticks?

05:32.900 --> 05:37.400
- Gunn's right. We can't risk it... yet.
- We'll restrict her access.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.400
Keep a closer eye on what she's up to.
Play her like she's been playin' us.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.400
Boss, we just got a tip
some loony's hatched from the bin.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.900
- A who did a what?
- A girl over in the nuthouse
went all <i>Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

05:47.900 --> 05:51.700
- Hacked up a couple of guards, went over the wall.
- Really not our department.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.600
<i>- Notify the authorities. Make sure they're on it.</i>
- Okay.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.900
But they better bring a priest.
Looks like this chick's gone all kinds of <i>Exorcist.</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:01.800
- Wait a minute. She's possessed?
- Duh.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.400
Didn't I say that?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.800
- I'll get a team together.
<i>- No. Wait.</i>

06:07.800 --> 06:10.300
I don't wanna go stormin' in with troops
until we know what we got here.

06:10.300 --> 06:14.200
I've seen a few of these possession cases.
They have to be handled very carefully.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.200
Real finesse job.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.300
Oh. [Chuckles]

- Didn't get the memo?

06:29.200 --> 06:32.000
- Hero of the people now.
- Then go and annoy them.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.600

of the simples went for a stroll.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600

06:36.600 --> 06:38.700
Goody for you,
'cause not offering it.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.600
Look, shouldn't you be out on the streets,
protecting the city from people like you?

06:43.600 --> 06:46.800
- I go where I'm needed.
- Which isn't here.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.100

07:00.800 --> 07:03.900

more of a threat at the end.

of inhuman strength.

- Right. Demon possession.
- That's ridiculous.

- No, I'm doing.

They took a young girl, and they
imbued her with the power of a demon.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.700
Thusly, the first Slayer
of the Vampyres was born.

15:01.700 --> 15:06.100
But, alas, the existence of a Slayer
is often brutal and short-lived.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.900
<i>And the Primitive, as she was called,</i>
<i>boasted no exception.</i>

15:10.200 --> 15:12.500
But the elders had foreseen
this inevitability...

15:12.500 --> 15:15.300
and devised a way
for her power to live on.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.800
In every generation,
one is chosen.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.700
Yes, attractive, slender woman.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.400
There are many Potentials,
as we experts call them.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.900
Hundreds, maybe thousands
per generation.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.200
Each of them experiencing
vivid dreams...

15:28.200 --> 15:31.600
some say nightmares,
of the heroics of past Slayers.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.800
But only one can be chosen.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.000
That's, uh, really great.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.500
But we actually know all that.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.700
You think you know, my good man.
You think you know.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.400
<i>Wait. So if there's</i>
<i>only one Slayer...</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:50.500
what is little Miss Whack Your Head Off
doing scampering around?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.400
A little Sunnydale surprise.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.500
Six months ago, Buffy,
Vampyr Slayer extraordinaire...

15:55.500 --> 15:59.200
had her lesbian witch make
with the <i>beaucoup de magie.</i>

15:59.200 --> 16:02.100
- One light show later...
- All the Potentials become Slayers.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.900
An army of Slayers.

16:04.900 --> 16:08.300
Brilliant stratagem.
But with the Watchers Council destroyed...

16:08.300 --> 16:11.100
how will these new Slayers
receive their necessary...

16:11.100 --> 16:14.800
Mr. Giles and a few
key Sunnydale alum...

16:14.800 --> 16:17.500
have been tracking
down the recently chosen...

16:17.500 --> 16:20.500
guiding them, training them,
giving them the full <i>X- Men...</i>

16:20.500 --> 16:23.000
minus the crappy third act.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.800
But this Dana girl, she's an anomaly
that no one could have foreseen.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.300
<i>Tortured, traumatized,</i>
<i>driven insane by Yoda-knows-who.</i>

16:31.300 --> 16:35.000
And then the dreams of demons and superpowers
she's always had suddenly become real.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.900
The dreams of Slayers
are usually just that... dreams.

16:37.900 --> 16:41.800
<i>But Dana's mental instability</i>
<i>may be making them seem more real.</i>

16:41.800 --> 16:44.600
My hypothesis exactly, Pryce.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.500
I see Mr. Giles may
have been wrong about you.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.800
That explains why that skirt
was yappin' at me in Chinese.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.400
Must've thought she was the Slayer
I took out back in the Boxer Rebellion.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.100
You mean the Slayer
you murdered.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.200
Well, I didn't have
a soul back then, did I?

16:58.200 --> 17:01.200
<i>Right. 'Cause having one now</i>
<i>is making such a difference.</i>

17:01.200 --> 17:03.700
You corporates go ahead
with your talky-talk.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.200
Anybody needs me,
I'll be out doin' his job.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.000
Spike.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.099
- You think this is a joke?
- Only if you're the punch line.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.000
We're the last two people that should be
confronting her. She's a Slayer.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.700
She has every reason to hate us,
and she's unstable.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.300
In her mind, there probably
aren't any good "vampyres."

17:20.300 --> 17:23.200
Vampires.
She exists for one reason...

17:23.200 --> 17:25.099
to destroy creatures like us.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.900
Dance of death.
Eternal struggle. Right. Got it.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.700
- You will, when she's staking you in the heart.
- What do you want me to do?

17:31.700 --> 17:34.200
Go all boo-hoo 'cause she got tortured
and driven out of her gourd?

17:34.200 --> 17:36.300
Not like we haven't done worse
back in the day.

17:36.300 --> 17:39.800
- Yeah, and it's somethin' I'm still paying for.
- You should let it go, mate.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.400
It's startin'
to make you look old.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.200
<i>[Elevator Bell Rings]</i>

17:59.400 --> 18:02.800
<i>[Girl Whimpering]</i>

18:07.900 --> 18:10.400
Hey, you okay?

18:11.700 --> 18:13.700
<i>You hurt?</i>

18:13.700 --> 18:17.600
Miss?
You need some help?

18:20.200 --> 18:23.400
Maybe Spike was right. Maybe we should
just get out there and find her.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.500
And then what? Kill her?
What's happening isn't her fault.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.100
She is non compos mentis. Not that it'll
matter when she's staking you in the pump.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.000
We know that she's been sighted
at these locations since her escape.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.600
<i>Tactical's doin'a nonengagement sweep,</i>
<i>but they'll have to cover over at least 60 blocks.</i>

18:37.600 --> 18:39.600
That'll take days,
if we're lucky.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.400
We have to narrow it down. Witnesses say
it was like she was looking for something.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.200
- We have to figure out what.
- Well, why not start at the source?

18:46.200 --> 18:49.400
- The asylum?
- No. Where all this started for her.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.600
- She was abducted from home, right?
- That was over 15 years ago.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
Houses have long memories,
Angelcakes.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.700
You just gotta know how
to get 'em to talk.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.800
[Sighs]
All right, fine, set it up.

18:58.800 --> 19:03.500
<i>But let's get Andrew in on this.</i>
<i>See ifhe knows... anything.</i>

19:03.500 --> 19:07.500
- Um, I don't think he's here.
- What? Where'd he go?

19:13.300 --> 19:15.200
Right.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.500
We can play cat and mouse
all night.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.800
Or I could wedgie you unconscious
and be done with it.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.600
Bravo. I see your senses
seem to be as...

19:25.600 --> 19:28.200

19:29.600 --> 19:31.700
What are you doin'
out here, Andrew?

19:31.700 --> 19:34.300
This is where the action is, bro.
On the mean streets. Can you dig it?

19:34.300 --> 19:37.000
Go back to Wolfram and Hart.
Don't have time for games.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.900
That's good,
'cause Andy ain't playin'.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.700

Just find him. Lorne, I wanna know
where he took her after he abducted her.

30:45.300 --> 30:48.500
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

30:49.600 --> 30:52.800
eight, seven...

30:54.800 --> 30:57.100
- Tactical found the body here, Fourth and Camden.
- Great.

30:57.100 --> 31:00.400
She's staying in the area. Let's get
aerial surveillance up, thermal imaging.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.200
- Have 'em go block to block, five-mile radius.
- What are they lookin' for?

31:03.200 --> 31:07.000
I mean, this is an industrial area. Most of
the buildings have a basement of some sort.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.900
- Lorne, any luck with the psychics on this place?
- No, nothin' new.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.500
It's still cold, creepy,
and smells like molasses.

31:12.500 --> 31:16.400
What about... I almost said the words
"molasses factory" out loud.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
Whiskey.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.200
Oh, God bless you, kitten. I was just about
to suggest the same thing.

31:21.200 --> 31:25.000
No, I mean when you're cookin' up whiskey,
it makes the whole room smell like molasses.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.500
Look for a distillery.
Get maps from ten years ago.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.300
- Andrew...
- We were attacked.

31:30.300 --> 31:33.900
I think she got him.
I think she got Spike.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.000
<i>Piece by piece.</i>

31:45.800 --> 31:47.700
- What did you do...
<i>- Shh.</i>

31:47.700 --> 31:51.700
Stay quiet. I'll let you go.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.300
[Exhales]
You hammer sack.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.500
What did you do... to me?

31:58.500 --> 32:02.300
Losing all your pieces.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.100
Not weak.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.600
Can't touch me anymore.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.200
Oh, God.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
I can't feel my...

32:44.200 --> 32:46.700
No!

32:46.700 --> 32:50.700
No more Daddy, no more Mommy,
no more hands.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.600
You can't touch me ever again.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.900
I never touched you.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.000
- Shut up!
- Stop!

32:57.000 --> 32:58.800
<i>You've got it wrong.</i>

32:58.800 --> 33:01.200
Your brain's all jumbled.
I never hurt you.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.000
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

33:03.000 --> 33:06.700
I've done my share of bad,
but you're not one of'em.

33:06.700 --> 33:10.000
It's someone else.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.200
[Girl Crying]

33:15.400 --> 33:18.100
You've got me confused
with another man.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.200
Let me go!
Let me go! Stop!

33:25.200 --> 33:30.300
Look. Visions are mixing
with your real memories...

33:30.300 --> 33:33.300
<i>right, all stuffed in your head.</i>

33:33.300 --> 33:36.400
Other Slayers, other places...
New York, China.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.600
[Speaking Chinese]

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
That's what you're remembering...
other Slayers.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.900
You killed her.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.900
Yes. But...

33:47.900 --> 33:50.200
You killed them both.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.300
That and worse.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.200
But I was never here.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.700
It doesn't matter!

34:03.700 --> 34:07.400
Head and heart.
Keep cutting till you see dust.

34:13.699 --> 34:16.800
Dana, look,
I'm here to help you.

34:20.900 --> 34:24.100
<i>The man who tried to hurt you,</i>
<i>his name is Walter Kindel.</i>

34:26.100 --> 34:29.400
He tried to rob a liquor store five years ago,
and the police shot him.

34:29.400 --> 34:34.000
<i>- He's dead, Dana.</i>
- Hold still.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.699
He can't hurt you anymore.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.400
[Panting]

34:39.400 --> 34:43.400
Can't hurt me.
Not weak anymore.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.100
That's right.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.800
Strong.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.900
Slayer.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.600
- [Grunting]
- Now!

35:28.200 --> 35:30.700
[Man]
We got her. Move in.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.600
<i>- [Angel] Get the med team down here, now.!</i>
<i>- [Man] You heard. Let's go.</i>

35:38.400 --> 35:42.100
Get it prepped, put surgical on standby.
We'll be there in ten minutes.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.300
Oh, for God's sake!
Tell the shaman no cadavers.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.100
We've got his hands.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.300
Go, go.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.100
Chain her into the van. I want armed guards
ridin' with her in the back.

36:01.100 --> 36:05.500
<i>- That's all right, boys. I'll take her from here.</i>
- What?

36:05.500 --> 36:09.300
Totally appreciate your help on this one, big guy.
Never could have found her without you.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.500
<i>But you've got enough problems</i>
<i>of your own to worry about.</i>

36:12.500 --> 36:14.700
Get out of the way, Andrew.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.300
She's a Slayer.
That means she's ours.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.400
Yeah. Sorry.
Not how it works.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.700
Load her up. Don't hesitate
to tranq her if she so much as...

36:26.700 --> 36:28.700
I don't think
you heard me, Angel.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.800
You think we're just gonna let you take
her back to your evil stronghold?

36:51.900 --> 36:54.300
Well, as they say in <i>México...</i>

36:56.200 --> 36:58.900
no...

36:58.900 --> 37:02.300
we're not gonna let you.

37:02.300 --> 37:05.800
She's psychotic, and I'm not
turning her over to you.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.800
You don't have a choice.
Check the view screen, Uhuru.

37:09.800 --> 37:13.800
I got 12 Vampyr Slayers behind me,
and not one of them has ever dated you.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.300
She's coming with us,
one way or another.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.700
You're way out of your league.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.800
I'll just clear this with Buffy.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.700
Where do you think
my orders came from?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.700
News flash... nobody in our camp
trusts you anymore.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.300
<i>Nobody.</i>

37:37.500 --> 37:39.900
You work for Wolfram and Hart.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.400
Don't fool yourself.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.500
We're not on the same side.

37:46.800 --> 37:51.300
Thank you for your help,
but, uh, we got it.

38:07.900 --> 38:09.800
So that's it?

38:09.800 --> 38:11.700
<i>Just gonna let him take her?</i>

38:12.700 --> 38:14.700
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>She's one of theirs.</i>

38:14.700 --> 38:16.600
They can handle it.

38:16.600 --> 38:21.000
Besides, you heard the man.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.900
We got enough problems
of our own to worry about.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.100
<i>[Footsteps Approaching Slowly]</i>

38:36.900 --> 38:39.600
Come to tap-dance
on the patient, have we, Doc?

38:39.600 --> 38:42.100
<i>I'd give you the finger,</i>
<i>but apparently...</i>

38:42.100 --> 38:45.100
I won't have the motor skills
till the drugs wear off.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.900
A lot of pain?

38:48.900 --> 38:51.500
More than I'd like.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.500
But not as much as you would.
Just what I deserve.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.400
[Sighs]
I didn't say that.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.900
No. I did.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.600
The lass thought
I killed her family.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.000
And I'm supposed to,
what, complain...

39:11.000 --> 39:14.600
'cause hers wasn't one
of the hundreds of families I did kill?

39:16.200 --> 39:18.800
I'm not saying you're right.

39:18.800 --> 39:24.300
'Cause, uh, I'm physically incapable
of saying that.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.800
But, uh...

39:26.800 --> 39:28.700
for a demon...

39:28.700 --> 39:31.800
I never did think that much
about the nature of evil.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.000
<i>No.</i>

39:34.000 --> 39:36.400
Just threw myself in.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.900
Thought it was a party.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.900
I liked the rush.
I liked the crunch.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.400
Never did look back
at the victims.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.700
I couldn't take my eyes
off them.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.200
<i>I was only in it for the evil.</i>

39:58.900 --> 40:03.200
That was everything to me.
It was art...

40:03.200 --> 40:06.600
the destruction of a human being.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.400
Geez, I would've considered
Dana a masterpiece.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.400
What happens to her?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.700
I don't know.

40:14.700 --> 40:18.700
Um, Andrew and the Slayers took her.
Didn't trust us to help her.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.000
Andrew double-crossed us?

40:22.800 --> 40:25.000
That's a good move.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
[Chuckles]
Hope for the little ponce yet.

40:30.400 --> 40:34.400
Though the tingling in my forearms
tells me she's too far gone to help.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.400
She's one of us now.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.000
She's a monster.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.600
She's an innocent victim.

40:46.900 --> 40:50.200
So were we...
once upon a time.

40:52.700 --> 40:56.500
Once upon a time.
