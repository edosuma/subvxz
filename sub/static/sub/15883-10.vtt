07:04.473 --> 07:06.004
- I first came in here...
- Stop that!

07:07.500 --> 07:10.451

you wouldn't even acknowledge

07:10.491 --> 07:12.358

be your son.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.500

- It's not a choice.
- Right.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.982

you know, some... you know,

07:48.054 --> 07:50.389

Ooh!
You must be "Le-Correct."

08:39.711 --> 08:43.604
Okay, well, we were just discussing
your options for adoption.

08:43.616 --> 08:46.218
And how difficult it is
to actually be approved.

08:46.218 --> 08:47.885
Oh, well you can just put
us on the list

08:47.953 --> 08:50.315
with a gold star and a check

08:50.328 --> 08:53.737

yester-doodle.

08:53.745 --> 08:55.560
Well, as I told your husband,

08:55.627 --> 08:57.582
it can be an extremely long
waiting period.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.044
Right, right. And it's even hard
for straight couples to adopt, so...

09:01.093 --> 09:04.479
Well, you tell them baby people
that we are going to be

09:04.509 --> 09:05.704
the best parents ever.

09:05.704 --> 09:07.705
Because we gonna be strict,
but also fun.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.941
Like, for instance,
everybody gonna have to clean up

09:10.008 --> 09:11.676

Dress-up Parade.

09:11.743 --> 09:13.711

what that is.

09:13.766 --> 09:14.780
(gasps)
I...

09:14.780 --> 09:16.390
Oh, every day gonna have
a different theme.

09:16.429 --> 09:17.615
- Is it?
- So, for instance,

09:17.683 --> 09:19.989
Monday, that's gonna be
"Under the Sea" day.

09:20.001 --> 09:21.969
Tuesday, that's gonna be
"Dress-up Parade."

09:22.037 --> 09:24.385
Wednesday gonna be based
on the Chinese calendar.

09:24.456 --> 09:27.024
Thursday gonna be
♪ "Sing What Ya Doing" day. ♪

09:27.092 --> 09:28.718
- Okay, and you know, actually...
- And then Friday...

09:28.729 --> 09:31.728
It might be very difficult when
you actually have kids, LaShawn.

09:31.757 --> 09:34.191
Kids? Do you want
to adopt more than one child?

09:34.233 --> 09:37.401
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely-tutely!

09:37.719 --> 09:39.220
It can speed things up

09:39.220 --> 09:41.517
if you're willing
to adopt siblings together.

09:41.517 --> 09:43.623
- Sammy, we can get a set.
- Why?

09:44.108 --> 09:47.277
- Sammy, we can get a set!
- We're not getting a set.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.046
Ooh!
(clicks tongue)

09:49.114 --> 09:50.915
We could dress them up
like companion objects.

09:50.983 --> 09:52.850
Like a bat and a ball,
or a kite in the wind.

09:52.918 --> 09:54.777
See?
LaShawn gets carried away, so...

09:54.806 --> 09:56.921
If you really want
to expedite the process,

09:56.989 --> 09:58.780
you could adopt
a special needs baby.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.859
- Miss, you are <i>killing</i> me here!
- Yes!

10:00.859 --> 10:03.631
Yes, that's what we want.
A special needs kid,

10:03.705 --> 10:06.097
preferably one with white eyes
and can tell the future.

10:06.164 --> 10:08.107
Okay, so now we're getting
a special needs kid.

10:08.144 --> 10:09.611
Uh, LaShawn,
there's a lot of extra cost

10:09.734 --> 10:11.101
When you get a disabled child,

10:11.153 --> 10:12.587
because that's what, actually,
"special needs" means.

10:12.587 --> 10:14.719
Come on. We ain't never gonna have
to worry about money again!

10:14.755 --> 10:15.855
How is that possible?

10:15.896 --> 10:17.196
'cause we gonna start
a family band,

10:17.208 --> 10:18.627
Called
"LaShawn and the Sam-Sations."

10:18.644 --> 10:21.746
And, ooh! How many times
can you change a child's name?

10:21.813 --> 10:23.114
Because I have this system.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.272
And it's a little bit
of an out-there idea,

10:25.284 --> 10:27.685
but I think if you really
set up a system

10:27.753 --> 10:30.554
where if you do something good,
you get a better name.

10:30.650 --> 10:32.349
So if your name is Allister
one day,

10:32.384 --> 10:34.152
you do something good,
your name could be Popeye.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.427
