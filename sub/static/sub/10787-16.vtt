WEBVTT

00:05.125 --> 00:06.959
I GOT IT.
WE CHECK OURSELVES
INTO THE B AND B,

00:06.959 --> 00:08.625
WE USE ASSUMED NAMES,
BESSIE'S NONE THE WISER,

00:08.625 --> 00:10.125
AND WE FINALLY GET
TO SPEND AN ENTIRE
NIGHT TOGETHER

00:10.125 --> 00:12.125
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 2 WEEKS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:12.125 --> 00:14.667
THERE ARE NO VACANCIES.
THERE'S SOME...

00:14.667 --> 00:17.333
WINTER ARTS FESTIVAL
OVER ON WELLFLEET.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.458
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT YOU AND ME,

00:20.458 --> 00:22.375
THE BOILER ROOM,
RIGHT NOW?

00:22.375 --> 00:23.834
NO.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.166
PACEY...

00:26.166 --> 00:28.333
YOU CONSIDERED THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:28.333 --> 00:30.166
YOU DID. I SAW IT
IN YOUR EYES.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.458
YOU, JOSEPHINE POTTER,

00:31.458 --> 00:33.667
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED
SKIPPING A.P. BIO

00:33.667 --> 00:36.125
AND ENGAGING IN ILLICIT
SEXUAL ACTIVITIES
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND...

00:36.125 --> 00:38.458
ON SCHOOL GROUNDS,
NO LESS. NAUGHTY GIRL.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.083
TSK TSK TSK TSK TSK.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.542
WELL, IT IS
SECOND SEMESTER
SENIOR YEAR.

00:44.542 --> 00:48.000
I GUESS THESE GRADES
DON'T REALLY COUNT
FOR ANYTHING.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.750
Drue: CLEARING THROUGH HERE.
PEOPLE, COMING THROUGH.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.708
EXCUSE ME.
OK, THE TWO OF YOU NEED

00:51.708 --> 00:53.750
TO BREAK THAT UP
OR CHARGE ADMISSION.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.708
EVERYONE, EVERYONE,
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE
ATTENTION HERE, PLEASE?

00:55.708 --> 00:56.625
A LITTLE ATTENTION.

00:56.625 --> 00:57.917
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
VOTING ENDED YESTERDAY

00:57.917 --> 01:01.667
IN THE HOTLY CONTESTED
CAPESIDE HIGH CLASS
OF 2001 SENIOR POLLS.

01:01.667 --> 01:05.000
AND RIGHT HERE,
I HAVE, IN MY HAND,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.041
FULLY CERTIFIED
FOR PUBLICATION
IN THIS YEAR'S YEARBOOK,

01:07.041 --> 01:09.333
RESULTS OF SAID ELECTION.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.375
NOW, UH, I CAN SEE
THAT YOU'RE ALL
DYING OF CURIOSITY.

01:12.375 --> 01:13.250
BUT...

01:15.375 --> 01:17.875
BEFORE WE GET TO ALL
THAT "MOST LIKELY
TO EKE OUT A MISERABLE

01:17.875 --> 01:20.750
AND MIND-NUMBING
EXISTENCE ON THE EDGE
OF SUBURBIA" CRAP,

01:20.750 --> 01:23.166
I JUST THOUGHT WE'D START
WITH CLASS COUPLE.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.417
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A CONTEST HERE, FOLKS.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.542
YES, IT'S THOSE
2 PEOPLE SO IN LOVE

01:27.542 --> 01:30.375
THEY MAKE THE REST
OF US WANT TO PUKE
ON A DAILY BASIS...

01:30.375 --> 01:32.000
JOEY POTTER...

01:32.583 --> 01:34.917
AND DAWSON LEERY.

02:30.792 --> 02:33.625
OK. NOW, HOW IS
THIS A FAIR FIGHT?

02:33.625 --> 02:34.625
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, HIT HER BACK?

02:34.625 --> 02:35.625
SHE'S A GIRL.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.250
SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?
ONE OF THE FEW

02:37.250 --> 02:39.250
CULTURAL ADVANTAGES
OF BEING FEMALE.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.500
WELL, YOU SEEM TO
HAVE THIS SITUATION
FIRMLY IN HAND.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.417
I THINK
I'M GONNA SKEDADDLE
OFF TO CLASS, OK?

02:43.417 --> 02:44.417
BYE.

02:44.417 --> 02:45.708
HEY, THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP, PAL.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.834
REMIND ME TO TELL HIM
ABOUT THE DIMPLED CHADS

02:47.834 --> 02:49.125
FOR HIM AND SOME
MS. JACOBS CHICK.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.333
WHOA!

02:50.333 --> 02:51.959
HEY. CHILL.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.375
HAVE YOU NO SENSE
OF HUMOR ABOUT THIS?

02:53.375 --> 02:54.375
I MEAN, PERSONALLY,

02:54.375 --> 02:55.375
I THINK IT'S
KIND OF FUNNY

02:55.375 --> 02:56.208
THAT A MAJORITY
OF OUR CLASSMATES

02:56.208 --> 02:58.333
STILL CARE SO MUCH
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.667
I MEAN, YOU AND DAWSON
WENT OUT FOR WHAT?

02:59.667 --> 03:01.166
ABOUT AS LONG
AS THE SPICE GIRLS
WERE POPULAR?

03:01.166 --> 03:02.166
PLEASE.

03:02.166 --> 03:03.708
MAJORITY, MY ASS, DRUE.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.333
IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU RIGGED THIS THING.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.667
OK. I SEE.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.000
UH, DID YOU VOTE?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.875
DID I VOTE?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.000
MOST POPULAR,
BEST-LOOKING. WHO CARES?

03:11.917 --> 03:13.875
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DO.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:15.166 --> 03:17.834
THIS ISN'T A JOKE.
THIS IS MY LIFE, OK?

03:17.834 --> 03:19.166
AND DAWSON AND I
ARE NOT A COUPLE.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.291
WE'RE NOT ANYTHING
RESEMBLING A COUPLE.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.208
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.250
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S TAKEN US A LONG TIME

03:22.250 --> 03:24.333
TO GET BACK TO THAT PLACE,
AND I REFUSE TO LET YOU

03:24.333 --> 03:27.166
HURT HIM OR PACEY
BY DREDGING UP THE PAST.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.333
SO, I SUGGEST
THAT YOU FIX THIS--

03:28.333 --> 03:30.375
OH, LOOK. IT'S
YOUR FRIEND, DAWSON.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.500
HEY, IS THIS MUGGING
BY INVITATION ONLY?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.667
YOU WANT
TO TELL HIM,
OR SHOULD I?

03:34.667 --> 03:37.000
ABOUT YOUR LATEST PATHETIC
ATTEMPT AT A PRACTICAL JOKE?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.500
I HEARD.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.875
AND?

03:39.875 --> 03:41.041
PRETTY FUNNY, ACTUALLY.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.875
YOU THINK
THIS IS FUNNY?

03:42.875 --> 03:43.875
HOW COULD IT BE
ANYTHING ELSE?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.500
IT'S SO
PATENTLY ABSURD.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
HOW CAN WE BE
CLASS COUPLE

03:46.500 --> 03:48.333
IF WE'RE NOT
EVEN A COUPLE?
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.375
THAT WORD AGAIN.
FRIENDS--

03:50.375 --> 03:51.834
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET
A RISE OUT OF US, JO,

03:51.834 --> 03:53.375
AND WE'RE LATE
FOR FIFTH PERIOD.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.083
LATER, KIDS.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.208
YOU WANT ME TO GO
DRINKING WITH DOUG?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.875
YEAH. WHY NOT?
IT WOULD BE FUN, YOU KNOW?

04:02.875 --> 04:04.250
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
LIKE YOU GOTTA BE HOME

04:04.250 --> 04:06.208
AT ANY SPECIFIC TIME
JUST 'CAUSE OF ME.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.208
IN FACT, YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD CRASH

04:07.208 --> 04:08.875
ON DOUG'S COUCH
IF YOU WANTED.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.083
YOU KNOW,
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE

04:10.083 --> 04:11.125
WHERE YOU'RE GOING
WITH THIS.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.375
GOING? I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH THIS.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.041
DRINKING AND DRIVING
IS A BIG NO-NO.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.416
AND THAT COUCH IS PRIMO.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.166
THAT THING IS GOOSE-DOWN.
YOU'LL SLEEP LIKE A BABY.

04:22.625 --> 04:23.917
YOU DID IT, DIDN'T YOU?

04:23.917 --> 04:24.917
YOU AND JOEY.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.625
WHAT? NO.

04:26.625 --> 04:27.750
HEH HEH HEH.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.208
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.458
YOU DID IT, AND NOW YOU
WANT TO DO IT AGAIN,

04:31.458 --> 04:33.250
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE
ASKING ME TO STAY
THE NIGHT AT DOUG'S

04:33.250 --> 04:34.166
AND WHY YOU'VE BEEN
IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD

04:34.166 --> 04:35.750
EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK
FROM THE SKI TRIP.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.583
YEAH. IS THERE SOME LAW

04:36.583 --> 04:38.041
THAT SAYS PACEY CAN'T
BE IN GOOD MOOD?

04:38.041 --> 04:39.917
I JUST WANT YOU AND
DOUGIE TO RECONNECT--

04:39.917 --> 04:41.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
NOTICE THIS BEFORE.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.917
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
ONLY 2 THINGS THAT
MAKE A MAN THIS HAPPY,

04:43.917 --> 04:46.041
AND THE OTHER ONE
IS FREE BEER.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.041
OH, GOD. THIS IS NOT WHY
I CAME OVER HERE, GRETCHEN.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.250
OH, COME ON.
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.083
NO, I THINK SWEET
WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING IT

04:54.083 --> 04:56.291
AND THEN NOT
TELLING ANYONE.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.750
WELL, IF THAT'S THE ONLY
THING YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT,

04:57.750 --> 04:59.583
THEN BUCK UP THERE, STUD,

04:59.583 --> 05:00.917
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.834
I PRIED IT OUT
OF YOUR COLD, DEAD HANDS.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.333
AND, UH, YOU HAVE MY SOLEMN
WORD I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.583
ANYONE?

05:08.583 --> 05:09.667
ANYONE.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.166
HEY, I USED TO BE
A HIGH-SCHOOL GIRL,
TOO, YOU KNOW?

05:12.166 --> 05:13.959
AND IN THE SPIRIT
OF THOSE DAYS,

05:13.959 --> 05:15.959
HOW ABOUT I JUST
CONVENIENTLY FAIL

05:15.959 --> 05:16.959
TO COME HOME
TONIGHT?

05:16.959 --> 05:19.125
YOU'D DO THAT?

05:19.125 --> 05:20.625
SURE. AND IF DOUG
WON'T HAVE ME,

05:20.625 --> 05:21.959
I'LL JUST CRASH
AT MOM AND DAD'S.

05:21.959 --> 05:22.959
YOU SURE?
SURE.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.291
BUT YOU OWE ME,
BIG TIME.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.458
I ALWAYS DO, GRETCH.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.708
YOU'RE THE BEST.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.792
[LAUGHS]

05:28.792 --> 05:30.458
FREAK.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.083
SO, WHAT MAKES
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH JACK SO IDEAL?

05:33.083 --> 05:35.500
I DON'T KNOW.
HE, UM...

05:35.500 --> 05:36.834
HE LISTENS TO ME,
WE HAVE FUN TOGETHER,

05:36.834 --> 05:38.708
AND...

05:38.708 --> 05:41.500
A-AND I FEEL LIKE
I CAN REALLY TRUST HIM.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.375
AND IF HE WERE STRAIGHT,
YOU COULDN'T TRUST HIM?

05:43.375 --> 05:45.959
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.959
WHAT ABOUT GIRLS?

05:49.458 --> 05:51.333
WHAT, YOU MEAN
SLEEPING WITH THEM?

05:51.333 --> 05:52.667
TRUSTING THEM.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.000
OH.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.500
YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT YOU FIND IT EASIER

05:55.500 --> 05:57.333
TO BE FRIENDS WITH GUYS
THAN WITH GIRLS.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.291
RIGHT. UM, GIRLS SUCK.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.708
[LAUGHS]

06:00.708 --> 06:02.291
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
THEY GET A LOBOTOMY

06:02.291 --> 06:03.208
THE DAY THEY
HIT PUBERTY.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.125
I MEAN, ONE DAY,
YOU'RE ALL MILLING

06:07.125 --> 06:09.291
AROUND F.A.O. SCHWARTZ
IN THE RAINBOW BRITE SECTION.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.667
THE NEXT DAY, SOMEBODY
GETS BREASTS AND...

06:11.667 --> 06:13.834
AFTER THAT, IT'S ALL ABOUT
GETTING BOYS TO LIKE YOU,

06:13.834 --> 06:15.458
AND WHOEVER DIES
THINNEST WINS.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.834
IS THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

06:16.834 --> 06:18.000
YOU WANTED BOYS
TO LIKE YOU?

06:20.417 --> 06:22.208
TEENAGE SLUTS AREN'T BORN.
THEY'RE MADE.
THAT KIND OF THING?

06:24.458 --> 06:27.708
YOU SAID BEFORE THAT YOU
MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER,

06:27.708 --> 06:30.166
SOME DECISIONS
YOU REGRET...

06:32.041 --> 06:34.333
YEAH.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.500
THE WHOLE...

06:35.500 --> 06:37.166
SEX BEFORE
THE 13th BIRTHDAY

06:37.166 --> 06:38.875
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.291
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE DRUNK
THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD SEX.

06:42.708 --> 06:43.917
AND THE SECOND
AND THE THIRD,

06:43.917 --> 06:44.875
BUT I THINK WE'VE
ALREADY BEEN OVER THIS.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.333
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

06:51.333 --> 06:53.250
SOME EMBARRASSING DETAILS

06:53.250 --> 06:54.625
OF YOUR FIRST
SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, HUH?

06:57.333 --> 06:58.583
OH, COME ON.
AREN'T YOU GONNA ASK ME

06:58.583 --> 06:59.917
WHY THAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME?

06:59.917 --> 07:01.208
DO YOU WANT ME TO?

07:01.208 --> 07:03.291
NO.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.250
IT'S JUST EVERY TIME
THAT I ASK YOU

07:04.250 --> 07:05.792
A PERSONAL QUESTION,
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW

07:05.792 --> 07:06.792
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.417
NOT THIS TIME.

07:08.417 --> 07:10.542
WHY, IS TIME UP
OR SOMETHING?

07:10.542 --> 07:12.625
I'M NOT ASKING,
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.041
I KNOW WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.875
I'M MUCH BETTER AT THIS
THAN YOU THINK I AM.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.291
ALSO, IT'S TIME.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.250
RIGHT.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.333
OK, THEN.

07:27.917 --> 07:28.917
SEE YOU TUESDAY?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.834
SEE YOU TUESDAY.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.125
THERE YOU GO.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.792
OH, HEY.
IS THAT FOR ME?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.000
NOPE.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.792
ONE OF THE WAITRESSES
FLAKED, AND I'M SO
NOT WORKING TONIGHT,

07:45.792 --> 07:47.458
BUT I TOLD THEM I'D WAIT
UNTIL THEY FIND SOMEONE

07:47.458 --> 07:49.125
OR UNTIL YOUR MOM
GETS HERE.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.417
OH.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.166
MMM! WHAT'S IN HERE?

07:53.166 --> 07:54.834
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH COFFEE
IN YOUR COFFEE. MMM.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.125
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

07:56.125 --> 07:58.834
LEERY'S FRESH FISH.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.417
OH, HI, GALE.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.458
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

08:04.458 --> 08:07.667
TRAFFIC ON 95 IS
ALWAYS A BITCH.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.166
UH, SURE.
YEAH, I'LL TELL BODIE.
NO PROBLEM.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.125
OK, HAVE FUN.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.125
MONDAY.

08:15.417 --> 08:16.291
BYE.

08:17.917 --> 08:18.917
THAT WAS YOUR MOM.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.792
HOW IS MOM?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.667
DAWSON?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.625
DID YOU FORGET
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

08:24.625 --> 08:26.375
SOMETHING, PERHAPS,
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS

08:26.375 --> 08:27.375
GOING OUT OF TOWN
THIS WEEKEND?

08:28.333 --> 08:30.959
UH, OH, HEY, GUESS WHAT?

08:30.959 --> 08:32.958
MY PARENTS ARE GOING OUT
OF TOWN THIS WEEKEND.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.291
HOW IS IT
I'M THE LAST PERSON

08:34.291 --> 08:35.207
TO GET
THIS INFORMATION?

08:35.207 --> 08:36.250
MY MOM DIDN'T TELL YOU?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.625
UH, NO.
THAT'S ODD.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.875
OF COURSE, YOU  NEVER
MENTIONED IT, EITHER.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.875
OK. BUSTED.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.166
[LAUGHS]

08:45.166 --> 08:46.333
WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

08:46.333 --> 08:49.291
HOW ABOUT "MY PARENTS
ARE GOING OUT OF TOWN
THIS WEEKEND?"

08:49.291 --> 08:50.291
ALL RIGHT.
SEE, YOU SAY IT,

08:50.291 --> 08:51.333
IT SOUNDS LIKE
NORMAL CONVERSATION.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.458
I SAY IT, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE WORLD'S
WORST COME-ON.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.375
[LAUGHS]

08:55.375 --> 08:57.250
OK. WELL, UM,

08:57.250 --> 08:58.792
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
COME OVER LATER

08:58.792 --> 09:01.166
WITH A COUPLE OF VIDEOS
AND SOME MICROWAVE POPCORN?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.291
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.667
[KNOCKING]

09:28.000 --> 09:29.708
GOOD GOD, WOMAN.

09:29.708 --> 09:30.834
IT'S NOT EVEN
NIGHTTIME YET.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.834
OH.

09:32.834 --> 09:35.208
THERE'S NOT
EVEN A "HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.208
HOW WAS YOUR DAY
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY,
PACEY?"

09:37.208 --> 09:38.375
HI.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.708
YEAH, HI.

09:39.708 --> 09:40.917
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE THIS TURN

09:40.917 --> 09:42.542
THAT OUR
RELATIONSHIP
HAS TAKEN HERE.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.083
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR MY FEELINGS.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.083
WE NEVER
TALK ANYMORE...

09:46.417 --> 09:47.750
PACE?
HMM?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.291
WE SPENT
9 MONTHS TALKING.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.917
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 2 WEEKS.

09:50.917 --> 09:51.792
WAIT, THAT STILL
DOESN'T MEAN

09:51.792 --> 09:53.542
THAT YOU GET
TO TREAT ME
AS A SEX OBJECT.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.708
AWW, I CAN TELL YOU'RE
ALL BROKEN UP ABOUT IT.

09:55.708 --> 09:56.708
YES, I AM.

09:56.708 --> 09:57.583
MM-HMM.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.125
WHEN'S GRETCHEN
COMING HOME?

10:02.125 --> 10:04.375
NEVER.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.917
GET SERIOUS, PACEY.
SHE LIVES HERE.

10:05.917 --> 10:06.875
SHE'LL COME HOME
EVENTUALLY.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.375
YES, TO PICK UP
A COUPLE THINGS,
AND THEN...

10:09.375 --> 10:10.875
AND THEN...

10:10.875 --> 10:12.750
AND THEN SHE'S GOING
TO CRASH SOMEWHERE ELSE

10:12.750 --> 10:14.208
SO THAT WE CAN
HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE
TO OURSELVES

10:14.208 --> 10:15.583
FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.250
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE WANTED, RIGHT?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.917
IT'S GREAT.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.083
SO, SHE KNOWS?

10:21.083 --> 10:22.250
GRETCHEN?

10:23.917 --> 10:25.667
YEAH.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.166
SHE KNOWS,
BUT IT WASN'T ME
THAT TOLD HER,

10:27.166 --> 10:28.959
YOU KNOW,
SHE FIGURED
IT OUT FOR HERSELF.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.166
ARE YOU MAD?

10:35.458 --> 10:38.000
NO, I'M NOT MAD.
I'M JUST...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.792
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED,
BUT IT'LL PASS.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.250
BUT THIS ISN'T
A PROBLEM. RIGHT?

10:43.250 --> 10:44.959
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF THIS IS
A PROBLEM,

10:44.959 --> 10:45.792
I'M PRETTY MUCH
WILLING TO DO

10:45.792 --> 10:47.583
ANYTHING
IN THE UNIVERSE
TO MAKE SURE

10:47.583 --> 10:48.417
THAT THIS ISN'T
A PROBLEM ANY MORE.

10:48.417 --> 10:49.417
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

10:49.417 --> 10:50.542
OK.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.375
I TAKE IT
YOU LIKE THIS WHOLE
THERAPY THING?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.375
WHAT MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

11:10.375 --> 11:13.125
YOU STARTED GOING
3 TIMES A WEEK.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.750
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.875
YOU KNOW, ISN'T
HIS OFFICE AROUND
HERE OR SOMETHING?

11:20.875 --> 11:23.708
YEAH, SOMETHING--
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.

11:23.708 --> 11:24.875
YEAH.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.667
IT'S POSSIBLY RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET,

11:26.667 --> 11:27.667
THAT BUILDING
YOU KEEP STARING AT.

11:27.667 --> 11:31.000
WHAT? I'M NOT--I'M NOT--
I'M NOT--I'M NOT STARING.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.625
YEAH, RIGHT.
COME ON,

11:32.625 --> 11:34.834
AND I WASN'T
LURED HERE UNDER
FALSE PRETENSES.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.834
WHAT FALSE PRETENSES?

11:37.834 --> 11:39.458
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU,
KIDDING ME?

11:39.458 --> 11:42.542
THE WINDOW SEAT,
THE 16 REFILLS...

11:42.542 --> 11:44.625
WE'RE STALKING
YOUR THERAPIST.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.333
WE'RE NOT STALKING ANYBODY.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.542
WE'RE SITTING.
WE'RE HAVING COFFEE
AND CONVERSATION.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.542
WE'RE COMPLETELY IMMOBILE.

11:52.542 --> 11:53.708
UH-HUH.

11:53.708 --> 11:55.875
IF DR. FROST
SHOULD HAPPEN TO WALK

11:55.875 --> 11:58.667
OUT OF HIS
ANALLY RETENTIVE,

11:58.667 --> 12:00.500
SCANDINAVIAN-DESIGNED
OFFICE--

12:00.500 --> 12:02.041
YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO FIND OUT

12:02.041 --> 12:03.583
SOMETHING ABOUT
HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

12:03.583 --> 12:04.875
NOW, HOW IS
THAT NOT STALKING?

12:04.875 --> 12:08.041
JACK, THIS GUY KNOWS
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME,

12:08.041 --> 12:09.708
I MEAN, THINGS
THAT I HAVEN'T
EVEN TOLD YOU,

12:09.708 --> 12:11.375
AND I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

12:11.375 --> 12:14.041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CAR HE DRIVES,
WHERE HE LIVES...

12:14.041 --> 12:16.083
FOR ALL I KNOW,
THE GUY COULD
BE A PROMISE KEEPER

12:16.083 --> 12:18.041
OR A CHRISTINA AGUILERA FAN.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.583
AND WE'RE GONNA
FIND ALL THAT OUT

12:19.583 --> 12:20.500
BY SITTING HERE
IN THIS WINDOW?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.417
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.959
WHOO! WOW, THERE HE IS.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
SO...

12:27.500 --> 12:29.375
SO, UP YOU GO.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.708
UP I GO--NO, WHOA!

12:31.708 --> 12:33.291
NO, SEE, YOU SAID
WE'RE SITTING, OK,

12:33.291 --> 12:34.708
WE'RE GONNA
REMAIN IMMOBILE.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.875
YEAH, BUT...
JACK, IF WE DON'T
FOLLOW HIM

12:36.875 --> 12:38.917
HOW ARE WE GONNA
FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?

12:38.917 --> 12:40.917
THAT'S VERY SIMPLE:
WE'RE NOT.

12:40.917 --> 12:42.750
PLEASE, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

12:42.750 --> 12:43.792
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT FRIENDS DO
FOR EACH OTHER.

12:43.792 --> 12:44.875
I'VE SEEN IT
IN THE MOVIES.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.125
YEAH,
ON WHAT PLANET?
COME ON.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.041
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SAYING I SHOULD HAVE A HOBBY.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.583
RIGHT, RIGHT.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.375
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK
I LIKED YOU BETTER

12:55.375 --> 12:57.083
AS A MATCHMAKING
NUDGE.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.708
I'D LIKE
TO ORDER A LARGE
PIZZA, PLEASE.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.750
Gretchen:
HI. I'M NOT REALLY HERE,

13:00.750 --> 13:02.583
I'M JUST
PICKING UP SOME STUFF.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.208
UH, LARGE, DUDE,
GRANDE.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.250
HEY, HOW DO
YOU SAY "CHEESE"
IN PORTUGUESE?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.750
UH, TRY FROMAGE.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.417
FROMAGE GRANDE.
GRETCHEN,

13:10.417 --> 13:12.417
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?
YEAH.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.792
THAT'S NOT IT.

13:14.792 --> 13:15.917
Pacey:
HOW ABOUT QUESO?
NO? LE  DAIRY?

13:17.834 --> 13:19.458
I KNOW THAT PACEY
TOLD YOU...

13:19.458 --> 13:22.083
WELL,
THAT YOU KNOW, AND,

13:22.083 --> 13:23.834
I WAS JUST HOPING
THAT YOU COULD...

13:23.834 --> 13:25.458
I CAN KEEP
MY BIG, FAT MOUTH SHUT?

13:25.458 --> 13:28.250
DON'T LOOK SO SERIOUS, JOEY.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.792
WHO AM I GONNA TELL?

13:29.792 --> 13:30.959
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE

13:30.959 --> 13:33.083
HAVE NO NEED TO KNOW
THIS INFORMATION

13:33.083 --> 13:33.875
BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY HURT THEM,

13:33.875 --> 13:35.625
AND BRING BACK
PAINFUL MEMORIES,

13:35.625 --> 13:37.792
AND IT'S NOT
WHAT I WANTED
THIS TO BE ABOUT.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.625
YOU GUYS ARE JUST FRIENDS.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.291
WE ARE. WE'RE JUST
NOT THE TYPE OF FRIENDS

13:41.291 --> 13:42.792
WHO TELL
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING
THE SECOND IT HAPPENS,

13:42.792 --> 13:45.250
AND IF HE WERE TO HEAR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

13:45.250 --> 13:47.792
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
ABOUT ME, I WOULD WANT
IT TO BE FROM--

13:47.792 --> 13:49.625
JOEY, I THINK WE'RE
IN COMPLETE AND TOTAL
AGREEMENT HERE.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.000
WE ARE?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.458
YEAH. I AM NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING TO DAWSON

13:54.458 --> 13:56.041
ON THE SUBJECT
OF YOU AND PACEY.

13:56.041 --> 13:59.125
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU--
I MEAN AS A FRIEND

13:59.125 --> 14:02.125
AND AS A VAGUELY OLDER
AND WISER SISTER-TYPE FIGURE--

14:02.125 --> 14:05.166
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION,
IT'S NOT ALL THAT HARD TO GUESS.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.792
I KNOW.

14:07.792 --> 14:09.458
I MEAN YOU LOOK HAPPY, JOEY.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.542
UH, SO THE GUY TELLS
ME IT'S GONNA BE
HERE IN 45 MINUTES,

14:17.542 --> 14:19.375
BUT I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT'S
GONNA BE ON IT.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.708
IT COULD BE DRIED
INSECTS FOR ALL I KNOW.

14:20.708 --> 14:21.792
GREAT.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.792
OK, I AM OUT OF HERE.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.208
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
HI AND BYE.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.166
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING, ANYWAY?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.333
DAWSON'S. SEE YA.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.875
OK. THERE HE IS.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.083
JUST DON'T
LOOK UP.
LOOK DOWN.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.917
ONE OF US
HAS TO LOOK UP, JEN.

14:50.917 --> 14:52.917
OTHERWISE IT DEFEATS
THE PURPOSE OF THIS WHOLE
STALKING THING.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.542
ALL RIGHT,
YOU LOOK UP.
OK.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.834
WHAT'S HE DOING?

14:55.834 --> 14:58.708
UH, WELL,
HE'S IN A BOOKSTORE.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.625
HE'S LOOKING AT BOOKS.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.583
UH-HUH.
WHAT'S HE LOOKING AT?

15:02.583 --> 15:05.917
AT THE MOMENT, LOOKS LIKE
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.

15:05.917 --> 15:07.583
SO, HE'S, UH,
HE'S OBVIOUSLY GAY.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.708
CAN WE GO NOW?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.875
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OBVIOUSLY GAY"?

15:12.875 --> 15:14.375
STRAIGHT PEOPLE
READ ANNE RICE.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.166
WELL, HELLO?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.708
YOU PARTY ALL NIGHT
WITH ETERNAL YOUTH

15:17.708 --> 15:18.583
AND A GREAT
WARDROBE.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.041
WHAT OTHER SEGMENT
OF THE POPULATION

15:20.041 --> 15:22.750
DOES THAT APPEAL TO?
HUH?

15:22.750 --> 15:24.375
HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO SURPASS ME

15:24.375 --> 15:25.583
IN THE KNOWLEDGE
OF ALL THINGS GAY?

15:25.583 --> 15:27.291
SEX AND THE CITY.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.250
HE'S MOVING.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.125
Jen: WHICH WAY?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.917
UH, HE'S GOING...

15:31.917 --> 15:33.250
HE'S GOING
THAT WAY,
SO GO THIS WAY.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.250
NO, NO!

15:34.250 --> 15:35.750
OH! JEEZ!

15:35.750 --> 15:36.750
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.917
OH, NO PROBLEM.

15:38.917 --> 15:40.875
HI...IT'S SO...

15:40.875 --> 15:42.917
THIS IS
MY FRIEND JACK.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.458
JACK, THIS IS--
THIS IS MY TH--

15:44.458 --> 15:46.417
FRIEND.
TOM FROST.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.583
HOW ARE YOU?

15:48.708 --> 15:50.083
JUST BROWSING
FOR BOOKS.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.500
WELL, THEY SEEM
TO HAVE THOSE HERE.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.625
HMM.

15:53.917 --> 15:54.959
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?

15:54.959 --> 15:55.959
IN POETRY?

15:55.959 --> 15:56.834
WHAT?

15:56.834 --> 15:59.583
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE BROWSING.
IN POETRY?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.625
RIGHT. YEAH,
I LOVE POETRY.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.750
WELL, I'M, UH,
QUITE FOND OF THIS PERSON...

16:05.959 --> 16:09.083
RIGHT,
ROBINSON ELLSWORTH.
I LOVE HIM.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.083
HER.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.083
UM, SHE'S READING TOMORROW

16:12.083 --> 16:13.625
AT THE ARTS FESTIVAL
OVER IN WELLFLEET.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.667
WOW.

16:14.667 --> 16:15.667
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.667
WELL, TAKE CARE.

16:17.667 --> 16:18.834
YOU, TOO.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.000
I DO LIKE POETRY.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.291
WHERE THE
SIDEWALK ENDS.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.125
YEAH, RIGHT.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.083
SO, I'M SURE
SHE'S JUST STOPPING
BY DAWSON'S,

16:31.083 --> 16:32.291
AND THEN THEY'RE
GONNA GO OUT,

16:32.291 --> 16:33.625
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA
GO BACK TO DOUG'S,

16:33.625 --> 16:35.166
SPEND THE NIGHT,
JUST LIKE SHE SAID.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.875
SO WHAT IF MITCH
AND GALE ARE
OUT OF TOWN?

16:38.959 --> 16:40.458
MITCH AND GALE
ARE OUT OF TOWN?

16:40.458 --> 16:42.375
LAST PRE-BABY TRIP.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.708
AT LEAST
ACCORDING TO BODIE.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.375
I'M SURE
IT'S NOTHING.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.625
WELL, IT HAS
TO BE NOTHING,
BECAUSE FRANKLY,

16:49.625 --> 16:53.875
THE ALTERNATIVE
IS JUST TOO HORRIFYING
TO CONTEMPLATE.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.125
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.
HE'S OUR FRIEND.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.166
ANY WAY YOU LOOK
AT IT, IT'S WEIRD.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.834
HMM.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.166
HOW WEIRD
WOULD YOU SAY IT IS?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.165
OUT OF 4 STARS,
OR ON A SCALE
FROM ONE TO 10?

17:04.165 --> 17:05.834
I'M BEING SERIOUS
HERE FOR A SECOND.

17:05.834 --> 17:06.916
DO YOU CARE?

17:09.375 --> 17:11.834
NO. YOU?

17:11.834 --> 17:13.416
NO.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.040
ARE YOU SURE?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.375
OF COURSE I'M SURE.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.875
IT'S ENTIRELY
NONE OF OUR
BUSINESS, PACE.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.917
AND BESIDES,
IT RUINS THE MOOD.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.333
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN

17:31.333 --> 17:33.166
AFTER WE'VE
WAITED SO LONG
FOR THIS NIGHT.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.875
COME ON.
IT WAS SWEET.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.708
I MEAN, LOOK,
SHE LOVED THE GUY
SO MUCH

17:39.708 --> 17:42.208
SHE MADE
THE SAME MISTAKES
ALL OVER AGAIN.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.208
AND SHE GOT
TO SLEEP WITH
THE MOTORCYCLE GUY.

17:44.208 --> 17:47.041
YEAH, BUT ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT HER AND NICK CAGE
BEING SOUL MATES? COME ON.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.667
JIM CARREY
WAS GOOD, THOUGH.

17:48.667 --> 17:49.834
YEAH.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.208
OK.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.083
NEXT.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.291
OK.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.750
LET'S THINK.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.375
I HAVE AN AMERICAN
MOVIE CLASSIC.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.667
OK.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.250
IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN HERE.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.750
YOU GO OUT EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT
WITH PAJAMAS AND A TOOTHBRUSH?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.750
NO. HEH HEH, NO.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.917
I JUST LIKE
TO BE PREPARED,

18:09.917 --> 18:12.417
YOU KNOW, FOR
WHATEVER POSSIBILITY
MIGHT COME UP.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.417
AND YOU SPENDING THE NIGHT
IS A POSSIBILITY?

18:18.417 --> 18:21.208
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?

18:23.792 --> 18:24.625
UH...

18:28.583 --> 18:29.583
THIS IS REALLY AWKWARD.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.417
HA HA HA! A LITTLE.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.333
YEAH.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.458
SO, YOU KNOW, HELL,

18:35.458 --> 18:36.542
LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT IT.

18:36.542 --> 18:39.041
SEX.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.708
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT,

18:40.708 --> 18:41.542
WE'LL GET IT
OUT IN THE OPEN,

18:41.542 --> 18:43.208
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
FEEL A LOT BETTER.

18:43.208 --> 18:45.458
OK.
OK.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.291
YOU'RE NOT TALKING.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.208
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.959
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

18:57.959 --> 19:00.125
OK, FINE. BE THAT WAY.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.125
I'LL START.

19:01.125 --> 19:05.208
UM...

19:05.208 --> 19:06.625
THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEX

19:06.625 --> 19:08.750
WAS WITH MY HIGH-SCHOOL
BOYFRIEND.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.792
NOT THAT MORONIC
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.125
YOU REMEMBER HIM?

19:12.125 --> 19:14.291
OH, GOD, YES
I REMEMBER HIM.
I HATED HIM.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.750
OH, NOW I HATE HIM
EVEN MORE.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.792
OK, THIS IS GOOD.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.959
SEE, WE'RE LAUGHING,
YEAH.

19:23.959 --> 19:24.959
WHICH IS
A LOT BETTER
THAN SITTING HERE

19:24.959 --> 19:25.750
NOT TALKING
TO EACH OTHER.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.000
RIGHT.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.250
YOUR TURN.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.250
I...

19:34.375 --> 19:35.959
THIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR.

19:35.959 --> 19:38.500
WHY?

19:38.500 --> 19:41.792
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD SEX.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.250
SO?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.667
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO THE MIDDLE EAST,

19:45.667 --> 19:48.166
BUT I STILL
HAVE FEELINGS
ON THE TOPIC.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.667
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.500
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.208
AND...

19:55.834 --> 19:57.166
UM...

19:57.166 --> 19:59.667
WITH JEN...

19:59.667 --> 20:03.125
UH, I MEAN,
I WAS 15 YEARS OLD.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.458
I DON'T THINK
IT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED
TO ME TO ASK, REALLY.

20:05.458 --> 20:11.375
UM...JOEY I...KIND OF THOUGHT
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.458
BUT SHE WANTED TO WAIT,
WHICH IS FINE.

20:13.458 --> 20:17.000
AND THEN EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED, HAPPENED.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.375
AND THEN, UH...

20:20.375 --> 20:23.250
WHEN THEY GOT BACK,
AT FIRST, I...

20:25.708 --> 20:27.834
GOD, I WAS RELIEVED,
WHICH IS LAME, I KNOW.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.917
IT'S JUST...I DON'T KNOW.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.750
A PART OF ME WAS STILL
CLINGING TO THE INSANE NOTION

20:31.750 --> 20:34.375
THAT JOEY AND I WERE DESTINED
TO LOSE OUR VIRGINITY TOGETHER.

20:34.375 --> 20:37.417
WELL, I GUESS IT'S
NOT ALL THAT INSANE,

20:37.417 --> 20:40.208
I MEAN,
SHE WAS YOUR FIRST
SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND.

20:40.208 --> 20:43.166
YEAH, BUT...

20:43.166 --> 20:44.917
NOW I JUST KIND OF WISHED
THEY'D DONE IT ON THE BOAT.

20:44.917 --> 20:47.708
YOU KNOW, I MEAN I JUST...

20:47.708 --> 20:49.750
OR JUST, THEY'D DO IT NOW
AND GET IT OVER WITH, YOU KNOW,

20:49.750 --> 20:52.583
PUT THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN
OF DAWSON AND JOEY.

20:55.417 --> 20:56.417
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY HAVEN'T?

20:56.417 --> 20:58.542
SHE TOLD ME.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.250
PRETTY ADULT, HUH?

21:02.250 --> 21:03.166
ESPECIALLY FOR US.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.375
I ASKED HER, AND SHE TOLD ME.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.083
[SIGHS]

21:28.083 --> 21:31.500
[SIGHS]

21:31.500 --> 21:33.625
WHAT'S THIS MOVIE
ABOUT, ANYWAY?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.792
UH, I HAVE NO IDEA.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.625
ALL I KNOW IS EVERY TIME
YOU GET UP TO GET
A DRINK OF WATER,

21:38.625 --> 21:40.375
YOU MOVE FURTHER AWAY
FROM ME ON THE COUCH.

21:43.834 --> 21:45.291
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.583
WHICH IS WHY
I SHOULD GO.

21:47.583 --> 21:50.041
I--DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
KIND OF A DRASTIC SOLUTION
TO OUR PROBLEM?

21:50.041 --> 21:51.458
DAWSON, DON'T, OK?

21:51.458 --> 21:52.834
DON'T WHAT?

21:52.834 --> 21:54.250
THIS IS NOT WHY
I CAME HERE TONIGHT.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.333
I GOTTA GO.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.125
WHA--WAIT A MINUTE.
GRETCHEN, HOLD ON.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.458
THIS IS SILLY. THIS IS
OBVIOUSLY SOME KIND
OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

22:02.458 --> 22:06.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW IT IS,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.583
I WAS REALLY WRONG
ABOUT SOMETHING.

22:08.583 --> 22:12.250
VERY WRONG.
SO JUST DON'T ASK ME
ANY MORE QUESTIONS, OK?

22:12.250 --> 22:13.542
JUST LET ME GO.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.333
YOU KNOW,
EVER SINCE THEY INVENTED
THE CARTOON NETWORK,

22:30.333 --> 22:31.667
THERE'S REALLY
NO REASON FOR HUMANS

22:31.667 --> 22:33.792
TO GET UP THIS EARLY
ON SATURDAY MORNING.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.834
I WANTED TO MAKE YOU
BREAKFAST.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.834
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

22:37.834 --> 22:41.458
WELL, I DON'T MAKE
BREAKFAST FOR JUST
ANYONE, PACE.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.917
I MEAN, IN THE PAST
YEAR, I'VE MADE IT
FOR, LIKE, WHAT?

22:43.917 --> 22:45.875
200-300 STRANGERS.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.333
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.333
OOH.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.333
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD WEAR
MY CLOTHES MORE OFTEN.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.500
YOU LIKE IT?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.875
YEP.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.208
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WASHED IT?

22:55.208 --> 22:57.041
HMM, I DON'T KNOW.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.000
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CAME OVER HERE
TO DO MY LAUNDRY?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
THAT WOULD BE NEVER.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.583
NEVER.

23:01.583 --> 23:04.250
WELL, THEN, I THINK
YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.417
YOU KNOW, WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT WHOLE THING

23:13.417 --> 23:15.542
ABOUT TELLING ME
WHAT YOU WANT,

23:15.542 --> 23:18.208
I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT
A REQUEST TO COME IN WRITING.

23:18.208 --> 23:21.208
MILK, EGGS, SYRUP.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.208
I KNOW WHAT
THIS REALLY IS.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.250
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.083
YOU HAD YOUR WAY
WITH ME,

23:26.083 --> 23:28.000
MY CONVERSATION
HAS GROWN TIRESOME,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
AND NOW YOU'RE
GIVING ME THE BOOT.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.375
GO. I'M GONNA
GET IN THE SHOWER
OR SOMETHING.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.375
MMM. OK.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.208
BUT ONLY AS LONG
AS YOU PROMISE ME

23:34.208 --> 23:36.542
YOU'LL BE WEARING THAT
WHEN I COME BACK.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.625
BYE-BYE.

23:44.542 --> 23:45.708
HEY.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.583
HEY. HEY, UH, SORRY
TO DROP BY SO EARLY.

23:49.583 --> 23:50.750
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR GRETCHEN.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.083
SHE'S NOT WITH YOU?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.750
UH, SHE WAS LAST NIGHT.
SHE NEVER CAME HOME?

23:56.083 --> 23:57.750
NO. BUT THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.250
SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST OVER AT DOUG'S.

23:59.250 --> 24:02.166
ALL RIGHT.
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:02.166 --> 24:03.708
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
SHE'S PROBABLY FINE.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.917
I JUST REALLY WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW IF SHE GOT HOME OK.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.291
WELL, SURE.
I'LL GIVE HER A CALL

24:07.291 --> 24:08.458
AND THEN
I'LL CALL YOU, OK?

24:08.458 --> 24:09.917
CAN YOU DO IT NOW?

24:09.917 --> 24:11.417
YOU WANNA CALL?

24:11.417 --> 24:13.583
YEAH, JUST BORROW YOUR PHONE.
IT'LL TAKE 2 SECONDS.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.333
YEAH, SURE THING.
THANKS.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.083
Dawson: SO, DUDE,
SINCE WHEN DO YOU GET UP

24:28.083 --> 24:29.458
BEFORE NOON ON THE WEEKENDS?

24:29.458 --> 24:30.792
Pacey: HEH HEH.
WELL, YOU KNOW,

24:30.792 --> 24:31.750
A MAN'S GOTTA EAT.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.291
OK, I DON'T SEE HIM.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.959
HE'S JUST LATE.
ALL RIGHT?

24:47.959 --> 24:49.208
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

24:49.208 --> 24:51.250
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
BECAUSE HE INVITED ME.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.458
HE DIDN'T INVITE YOU, OK?

24:52.458 --> 24:55.500
HE WAS JUST MAKING
POLITE CONVERSATION.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.959
AT LEAST, I HOPE HE WAS.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.083
I'M STARTING
TO SENSE THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE

24:58.083 --> 25:00.125
THE HIGHEST OPINION
OF PSYCHIATRISTS.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.166
WITH MY FAMILY HISTORY?

25:02.166 --> 25:03.166
FORGIVE ME
FOR NOT THINKING

25:03.166 --> 25:04.375
THAT PSYCHIATRY
IS FOOLPROOF.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.834
LOOK, NOT ALL THERAPISTS
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
YOU KNOW?

25:06.834 --> 25:09.834
THEY'RE JUST AS FALLIBLE
AS AUTO MECHANICS,

25:09.834 --> 25:11.583
PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.083
AND FOR STARTERS,
ANY THERAPIST

25:13.083 --> 25:14.875
THAT'S GONNA DATE
ONE OF HIS PATIENTS

25:14.875 --> 25:17.041
IS JUST NOT WORTH
HAVING AROUND.

25:17.041 --> 25:19.333
JACK, SHH!

25:19.333 --> 25:21.959
GOD, I AM NOT TRYING
TO DATE HIM. ALL RIGHT?

25:21.959 --> 25:23.166
I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN
THE GUY.

25:23.166 --> 25:24.917
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT MY TYPE.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.291
SO, YOU ABSOLUTELY,
POSITIVELY,

25:26.291 --> 25:27.375
DO NOT HAVE A CRUSH
ON THIS GUY?

25:27.375 --> 25:29.208
NO, I DON'T HAVE
A CRUSH ON HIM.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.000
GOD, I...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.125
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE ASKING ME ALL THIS.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.458
WELL, IT'S FAIRLY
COMMON FOR PEOPLE

25:34.458 --> 25:37.000
TO DEVELOP A THING
FOR THEIR SHRINKS.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.291
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE, ALL RIGHT?

25:39.291 --> 25:41.792
FORGIVE ME
FOR ASKING,

25:41.792 --> 25:42.750
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.625
WHY DO YOU NEED
THIS GUY TO LIKE YOU
SO MUCH?

25:46.208 --> 25:48.542
I DON'T NEED HIM
TO LIKE ME.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.208
RIGHT.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.333
YEAH, I FORGOT.
YOU LOVE POETRY.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.250
RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT, DOUG.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.208
OK. THANKS. BYE.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.708
PROBLEM SOLVED?

26:01.708 --> 26:03.291
YEAH, GREAT. THANK YOU.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.708
HEY, BETTER SAFE
THAN SORRY. RIGHT?

26:04.708 --> 26:07.208
YEAH. YEAH. SO, UH...

26:07.208 --> 26:09.792
JUST LET HER KNOW
I STOPPED BY.

26:09.792 --> 26:10.834
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

26:10.834 --> 26:12.583
DON'T TELL HER I STOPPED BY.

26:12.583 --> 26:16.083
DON'T TELL HER,
AND I'LL SEE IF SHE CALLS.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.417
DAWSON, LOOK...

26:18.417 --> 26:19.542
IF YOU GUYS
HAD A FIGHT

26:19.542 --> 26:20.834
AND YOU WANT ME
TO SAY SOMETHING...

26:20.834 --> 26:21.750
[SIGHS]

26:24.208 --> 26:25.417
WE DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHT.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.875
IT'S JUST I...

26:30.750 --> 26:33.750
I JUST THINK
SHE'S SEEN THE LIGHT.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.834
BUT, UH, THANKS.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.583
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:47.667 --> 26:48.625
GREAT.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.417
WELL...

26:56.417 --> 26:57.750
HE'S NOT HERE.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.792
HE'S NOT GONNA
BE HERE.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.458
YEAH, NEVER WAS
GONNA BE HERE.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.417
OK, YOU WIN. HAPPY?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.583
YEAH. CAN WE GO?
PLEASE?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.208
YOU KNOW, WOULD IT
KILL YOU TO SIT

27:10.208 --> 27:12.667
AND LISTEN
TO SOME POETRY?

27:12.667 --> 27:15.500
YEAH.
YEAH, IT WOULD.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.625
OK, YOU'RE RIGHT.
COME ON.

27:19.291 --> 27:20.750
YOU SAVED ME A SEAT.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.583
WELCOME, EVERYONE,
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH

27:30.583 --> 27:32.750
FOR GETTING UP THIS EARLY.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.667
THE FIRST POEM IS CALLED
"SO IT NEVER WILL CRUMBLE."

27:36.291 --> 27:37.500
[READING POEM]

27:45.083 --> 27:47.917
THANK GOD. THESE PLACES
CAN BE SO LONELY.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.041
THAT'S ONE
OF THE ATTRACTIONS.

27:50.041 --> 27:52.166
YOU'RE MAD ABOUT MY LITTLE
PRACTICAL JOKE, AREN'T YOU?

27:52.166 --> 27:53.500
ACTUALLY, NO, I'D
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT

27:53.500 --> 27:55.125
IN THE WAKE OF GREATER
PERSONAL TRAGEDIES.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.667
BUT SINCE YOU INSIST
ON INVADING MY SPACE--

27:56.667 --> 27:57.959
YOU WANT ME
TO UNFIX THE ELECTION?

27:57.959 --> 27:59.834
LET JOEY AND PACEY
WIN AS CLASS COUPLE?

27:59.834 --> 28:02.083
MM-MMM. SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.291
IT'S TOO BORING.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.291
WHERE'S THE CONFLICT?
WHERE'S THE DRAMA?

28:05.291 --> 28:07.000
THERE ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE ANY DRAMA.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.125
YOU SEE?
IT'S THINKING LIKE THAT

28:08.125 --> 28:10.834
THAT KEEPS
HIGH-SCHOOL YEARBOOKS
MIRED IN MEDIOCRITY.

28:10.834 --> 28:12.333
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THEY SHOULD BE FICTION

28:12.333 --> 28:13.708
RATHER THAN FACT?

28:13.708 --> 28:15.333
PERSONALLY,
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE TRUTH

28:15.333 --> 28:16.792
TO BE A SLIPPERY
LITTLE DEVIL

28:16.792 --> 28:18.667
AND SOMEWHAT LACKING
IN THE FUN DEPARTMENT.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.208
AND YOU DON'T CARE
WHO GET'S HURT?

28:20.208 --> 28:21.500
IT'S DOWNRIGHT SWEET,

28:21.500 --> 28:24.667
ALL THIS CONCERN
YOU SEEM TO HAVE FOR JOEY,

28:24.667 --> 28:27.708
BUT I SHOULD PROBABLY
WARN YOU,

28:27.708 --> 28:29.667
ALL IT REALLY DOES
IS PROVE MY POINT.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.208
I WASN'T AWARE
THAT YOU HAD ONE.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.083
OH, GOD, PLEASE.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.458
THIS WHOLE FRIEND DANCE
THAT YOU GUYS DO,

28:34.458 --> 28:37.166
AS IF YOU WERE
ACTUALLY OVER EACH OTHER?

28:37.166 --> 28:39.375
AS IF YOU HADN'T
FATALLY WOUNDED

28:39.375 --> 28:40.750
EACH OTHER'S PSYCHES
AND DOOMED

28:40.750 --> 28:41.875
ALL YOUR
FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS?

28:41.875 --> 28:44.083
I MEAN...

28:44.083 --> 28:45.750
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS GREAT STUFF.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.500
IT'S WHAT MAKES
YOU AND JOEY

28:47.500 --> 28:50.542
FAR AND AWAY
THE MORE COMPELLING COUPLE.

28:50.542 --> 28:52.750
WELL, MUCH AS I
APPRECIATE HAVING MY LIFE
EXPLAINED TO ME BY YOU,

28:52.750 --> 28:55.208
THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAVE NO INTENTION

28:55.208 --> 28:56.375
OF UNFIXING THIS PROBLEM.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.917
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.250
I GUESS MINE ARE, TOO.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.041
HEY.

29:15.041 --> 29:16.917
YOU'RE BACK.

29:16.917 --> 29:18.041
I AM.

29:26.083 --> 29:29.041
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

29:29.041 --> 29:31.750
MEANING?

29:31.750 --> 29:33.917
I DON'T KNOW.
I KINDA GOT THE IMPRESSION

29:33.917 --> 29:35.750
THAT EVERYONE WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

29:35.750 --> 29:38.750
AND BY EVERYBODY
YOU MEAN PACEY
AND DAWSON.

29:38.750 --> 29:39.708
'CAUSE THAT WOULD
PRETTY MUCH BE
EVERYBODY,

29:39.708 --> 29:40.625
NOW, WOULDN'T IT?

29:42.125 --> 29:45.083
SOMETIMES I WISH
I'D BEEN HERE
LAST YEAR,

29:45.083 --> 29:46.792
BECAUSE I WOULD
REALLY LIKE TO KNOW

29:46.792 --> 29:48.959
HOW YOU GUYS GOT
INTO THIS MESS
TO BEGIN WITH.

29:48.959 --> 29:51.375
YOU'RE ALL
SO WORRIED ABOUT
HURTING EACH OTHER.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.291
EVERYBODY'S TRYING
TO BE SO NICE
ALL THE TIME...

29:54.291 --> 29:55.542
EXCEPT YOU?

29:57.417 --> 30:00.291
YEAH. EXCEPT ME.

30:00.291 --> 30:04.083
I'M REALLY NOT FEELING
TOO NICE AT THE MOMENT.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.667
LOOK, GRETCHEN, I KNOW

30:07.667 --> 30:09.834
THAT YOU AND DAWSON
HAD A FIGHT OR SOMETHING,

30:09.834 --> 30:11.083
AND I KNOW THAT YOU
DIDN'T SPEND THE NIGHT

30:11.083 --> 30:12.458
AT HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.125
DID YOU WANT ME TO?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.625
YOU KNOW,
ALL THESE LIES,

30:16.625 --> 30:18.250
THESE LIES THAT
YOU'RE ALL TELLING

30:18.250 --> 30:19.750
TO PROTECT EACH OTHER,

30:19.750 --> 30:20.834
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
SOLVE ANYTHING.

30:20.834 --> 30:23.083
WHAT LIES?

30:23.083 --> 30:24.834
YOU LIED TO DAWSON
ABOUT YOU AND PACEY
HAVING SEX.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.083
I MADE A DECISION,

30:27.083 --> 30:29.458
A VERY PRIVATE DECISION
ABOUT MY LIFE,

30:29.458 --> 30:30.959
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT
THE WHOLE WORLD
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.000
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
DAWSON TO KNOW ABOUT.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.417
WELL, IT'S THE SAME THING.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.625
NO, IT'S NOT, JOEY.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.166
I DON'T WANNA BE
THE OGRE HERE,

30:37.166 --> 30:39.500
BUT LYING TO DAWSON
ISN'T GONNA SOLVE
ANYTHING.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.333
IT'S NOT FAIR TO HIM.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.500
AND IT'S NOT FAIR
TO SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING

30:42.500 --> 30:44.166
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.125
MEANING YOU.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.667
YOU KNOW, GRETCHEN,
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.

30:49.667 --> 30:51.792
YOU WEREN'T HERE
LAST YEAR,

30:51.792 --> 30:52.834
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE,

30:52.834 --> 30:55.708
SO THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU
COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.583
YOU HAVE TO TELL DAWSON
THE TRUTH.

30:57.583 --> 30:58.959
THERE'S
NO OTHER CHOICE HERE.

30:58.959 --> 31:01.667
AND IF YOU WON'T DO IT
FOR HIM OR FOR ME,

31:01.667 --> 31:03.583
THEN JUST DO IT
FOR PACEY.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.125
Pacey:
WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS?

31:07.125 --> 31:09.458
UH, BESSIE HAD
SOME SORT OF A MELTDOWN.

31:09.458 --> 31:12.667
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

31:12.667 --> 31:15.333
UH, RIGHT. GIVE ME A CALL.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.875
Joey: YEAH.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.375
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT'D I MISS?

31:29.375 --> 31:30.792
NOTHING.

31:33.708 --> 31:36.708
YOU AND DAWSON HAD
SOME SORT OF FIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

31:36.708 --> 31:39.041
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
CARE, PACEY?

31:39.041 --> 31:41.208
WHAT? I CAN'T TAKE
AN INTEREST IN YOUR LIFE?

31:41.208 --> 31:42.500
NO.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.083
OK, WELL, IF YOU AND DAWSON
DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHT,

31:45.083 --> 31:46.208
THEN WHAT WERE YOU
AND JOEY TALKING ABOUT?

31:46.208 --> 31:48.875
AND WHY WAS HE HERE
AT THE CRACK OF DAWN
THIS MORNING?

31:48.875 --> 31:50.083
DAWSON WAS HERE?

31:50.083 --> 31:52.875
YEAH. DAWSON WAS HERE,
BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU THAT,

31:52.875 --> 31:53.875
SO YOU DIDN'T
HEAR IT FROM ME.

31:53.875 --> 31:54.708
AND UNLIKE YOU,

31:54.708 --> 31:56.375
HE DOES SEEM TO BE
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

31:56.375 --> 31:57.208
THAT YOU HAD A FIGHT
LAST NIGHT.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.417
HE JUST DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.291
PACEY, YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR

31:59.291 --> 32:01.250
ABOUT ME AND DAWSON,
SO JUST STOP, OK?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.250
STOP WHAT?

32:02.250 --> 32:03.750
STOP ASKING.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.750
OK, NOW I REALLY WANT
TO KNOW, GRETCHEN.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.291
NO, YOU DON'T.
BELIEVE ME. YOU DON'T.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.917
YES, I DO,

32:09.917 --> 32:11.417
BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO HAVE
THIS HORRIFYING FEELING

32:11.417 --> 32:12.834
THAT IT SOMEHOW INVOLVES ME.

32:18.375 --> 32:19.917
AH, NO COMMENT.

32:19.917 --> 32:23.917
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK
JOEY ABOUT THIS?

32:23.917 --> 32:26.083
YOU WANT ME
TO ASK JOEY
ABOUT THE PROBLEM

32:26.083 --> 32:27.208
THAT YOU AND DAWSON
ARE HAVING?

32:27.208 --> 32:28.458
YEAH.

32:28.458 --> 32:30.708
NO. NO, LOOK.

32:30.708 --> 32:31.917
PACEY, I'M JUST REALLY NOT

32:31.917 --> 32:34.083
IN THE BEST OF MOODS
RIGHT NOW, OK?

32:34.083 --> 32:35.417
I MEAN, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT

32:35.417 --> 32:38.375
ABOUT ME AND DAWSON.
MAYBE HE'S TOO YOUNG FOR ME.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.250
MY GOAL IS NOT
TO BE RIGHT.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.583
MY GOAL IS TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON,

32:41.583 --> 32:43.166
ESPECIALLY
IF IT INVOLVES
ME AND JOEY,

32:43.166 --> 32:45.125
SO I THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD JUST TELL ME

32:45.125 --> 32:46.667
WHAT'S GOING ON,

32:46.667 --> 32:48.291
WHATEVER IT IS.

32:48.291 --> 32:51.000
AND I WON'T
MENTION IT
TO DAWSON AND JOEY.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.250
GREAT. MORE LIES.
THAT'S REALLY GONNA HELP.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.291
MORE LIES?

32:54.291 --> 32:55.959
WHAT LIES?

32:55.959 --> 32:56.959
'CAUSE THE ONLY LIE
THAT I CAN SEE

32:56.959 --> 32:57.750
THAT'S BEING PERPETRATED
RIGHT NOW

32:57.750 --> 33:00.542
IS YOU, MY OWN SISTER,
LYING TO ME.

33:03.959 --> 33:06.333
JOEY LIED TO DAWSON.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.917
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

33:07.917 --> 33:09.250
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT,

33:09.250 --> 33:11.125
BUT HE ASKED HER
FLAT-OUT

33:11.125 --> 33:12.291
WHETHER YOU GUYS WERE
SLEEPING TOGETHER,

33:12.291 --> 33:14.750
AND SHE LIED.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.500
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH,
PACEY.

33:24.458 --> 33:25.458
Jen: HI.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.208
SO, WHICH ONE
WAS YOUR FAVORITE?

33:27.208 --> 33:28.250
WHICH ONE?

33:28.250 --> 33:29.458
WHICH POEM?

33:29.458 --> 33:30.917
WHICH POEM.
WHICH POEM, UM...

33:30.917 --> 33:33.000
GOD, THEY WERE
SO GOOD.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.458
I'D SAY, PROBABLY
THE LAST ONE WOULD BE GOOD.

33:35.458 --> 33:37.500
YEAH. DEFINITELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.083
IT WAS, YOU KNOW,
IT HAS THIS REALLY,
UM...

33:40.083 --> 33:42.500
THIS REALLY SURREAL
QUALITY TO IT,

33:42.500 --> 33:44.625
WHICH--ALL THE SAME,
IT WAS VERY DEEP

33:44.625 --> 33:46.500
AND--AND
TOTALLY ORIGINAL,

33:46.500 --> 33:49.000
BUT REALLY
GREAT IMAGERY.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.208
YEAH.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.166
DON'T DITCH ME, OK?

33:51.166 --> 33:53.333
I STILL HAVE TO DO
THIS LINGER-AND-TALK THING.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.959
ROBIN, THIS IS
JEN AND JACK.

33:56.041 --> 33:57.708
OH, HI. THANKS FOR COMING.

33:57.708 --> 33:59.000
SURE.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.959
JEN WAS JUST
TELLING US HOW MUCH

33:59.959 --> 34:00.959
SHE LIKED
THE LAST ONE.

34:00.959 --> 34:02.834
OH. THAT'S
HIS FAVORITE, TOO.

34:02.834 --> 34:03.875
NOT THAT HE GETS IT.
[LAUGHS]

34:05.667 --> 34:06.708
YOU GUYS
HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS?

34:06.708 --> 34:08.375
Jack: YEAH. YEAH.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.875
I TOLD YOU ALL HOPE
WAS NOT LOST

34:09.875 --> 34:11.542
FOR THE YOUTH OF AMERICA.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.000
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE
HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
THE THINGS THAT
WE USED TO--

34:14.000 --> 34:15.875
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE MIXING?

34:15.875 --> 34:17.542
WELL, ONLY IF
YOU MIX WITH ME.

34:17.542 --> 34:18.833
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU BOTH.

34:18.833 --> 34:21.250
Jack and Jen: YOU, TOO.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.083
DEFINITELY NOT GAY.

34:25.375 --> 34:26.583
NO.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.041
THIS IS BY FAR
THE STRANGEST PLACE

34:35.041 --> 34:36.708
YOU'VE EVER ASKED ME
TO MEET YOU.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.875
AH, YEAH.
I DECIDED TO, UH,

34:38.875 --> 34:40.542
YOU KNOW, PITCH IN,
MAKE SURE THE RIGHT
PEOPLE

34:40.542 --> 34:42.542
ENDED UP
ON THE RIGHT PAGES.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.000
NOT BUYING IT?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
WE BOTH KNOW THAT YEARBOOK

34:46.000 --> 34:48.542
IS A SHAMEFUL, SQUALID
WASTE OF TIME.

34:48.542 --> 34:50.375
ALL WILL BE REVEALED
IN GOOD TIME.

34:52.583 --> 34:55.083
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?

34:55.083 --> 34:56.417
YOU DRINK BLACK COFFEE?

34:56.417 --> 34:58.917
OH, YEAH.

34:58.917 --> 35:01.458
I DRINK IT.
I DON'T LIKE IT,
BUT I DRINK IT.

35:01.458 --> 35:02.458
FIGURE EVERYBODY'S
GOT TO HAVE

35:02.458 --> 35:03.333
AT LEAST ONE VICE,
RIGHT?

35:05.291 --> 35:07.834
I GUESS THERE'S
A LOT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

35:11.834 --> 35:12.792
THAT'S NOT HOW
IT USED TO BE.

35:12.792 --> 35:16.291
I MEAN, WE...

35:16.291 --> 35:19.583
WE USED TO BE ABLE TO TELL
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.792
YEAH.

35:20.792 --> 35:23.583
I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS
SUCH A GOOD THING.

35:23.583 --> 35:28.500
NOT A VERY DAWSON LEERY-LIKE
THING TO SAY.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.458
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO SOMETHING ELSE

35:30.458 --> 35:32.250
THAT I WANT TO SAY
TO YOU. UM...

35:32.250 --> 35:33.917
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

35:33.917 --> 35:35.792
FOR WHAT?

35:35.792 --> 35:38.458
FOR THAT QUESTION
THAT I ASKED YOU
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

35:38.458 --> 35:39.959
THAT VERY
PERSONAL QUESTION.

35:39.959 --> 35:42.792
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
ASKED YOU THAT.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.667
I...

35:44.667 --> 35:46.083
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I DID.

35:46.083 --> 35:48.417
IT'S SOME MASOCHISTIC
SIDE OF ME

35:48.417 --> 35:51.417
THAT I HAVEN'T
EXPLORED YET.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.083
PROBABLY THE SAME SIDE
OF ME THAT'S SABOTAGING

35:53.083 --> 35:54.000
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH GRETCHEN.

35:57.959 --> 36:00.250
YOU THINK YOU'RE SABOTAGING
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

36:00.250 --> 36:01.750
WELL, MENTIONING YOU
EVERY 30 SECONDS,

36:01.750 --> 36:04.291
I'M SURE, DOESN'T HELP.

36:04.291 --> 36:07.500
I'M JUST--I DON'T KNOW,
I'M SO TERRIFIED

36:07.500 --> 36:09.417
OF MAKING THE SAME
MISTAKES THAT I MADE
IN THE PAST

36:09.417 --> 36:10.333
THAT EVERY MINUTE
I'M WITH HER

36:10.333 --> 36:12.166
TURNS INTO THIS PITCHED
BATTLE IN MY HEAD.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.834
I MEAN, DO I SHOW HER
THE CONFUSED MESS

36:14.834 --> 36:15.667
THAT I REALLY AM?

36:15.667 --> 36:18.667
OR, YOU KNOW, DO I
ATTEMPT TO ACT COOL,

36:18.667 --> 36:20.333
BE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO GETS THE GIRL?

36:20.333 --> 36:23.333
MAYBE YOU ARE THE GUY
THAT GETS THE GIRL.

36:25.667 --> 36:26.959
I DIDN'T GET YOU.

36:30.542 --> 36:32.333
ANYWAY...

36:36.375 --> 36:37.792
SENIOR POLLS?

36:37.792 --> 36:39.667
IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT DRUE

36:39.667 --> 36:41.875
IS KIND OF LIKE ONE
OF THE MORE LAME

36:41.875 --> 36:43.667
TV BATMAN VILLAINS--

36:43.667 --> 36:46.166
EVIL WITH A SHORT
ATTENTION SPAN.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.166
HE WENT THROUGH
ALL THE TROUBLE

36:47.166 --> 36:48.667
OF RIGGING THE ELECTION

36:48.667 --> 36:50.041
AND THEN QUIT
THE YEARBOOK STAFF

36:50.041 --> 36:52.208
BEFORE HIS PLAN
COULD BE FULLY REALIZED.

36:52.208 --> 36:55.333
SO, YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING
YOUR SERVICES TO YEARBOOK.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.375
YEAH, I FIGURED I'D
FOLLOW THROUGH FOR HIM.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.000
YOU KNOW?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.208
FOR POSTERITY'S SAKE
IF NOTHING ELSE.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.333
AT LEAST LET THE RECORD
REFLECT THE TRUTH
THIS SENIOR YEAR.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.708
SHE SEEMS REALLY NICE,
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.834
SHE IS NICE.

37:10.834 --> 37:13.708
SO, SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

37:13.708 --> 37:17.375
LIKE I SAID,
I AM GLAD YOU CAME.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.250
SO I COULD MAKE
A TOTAL IDIOT OF MYSELF?

37:19.250 --> 37:21.917
NO, BECAUSE YOU
LIKE POETRY.

37:21.917 --> 37:24.834
AND SITTING IN
COFFEEHOUSE WINDOWS

37:24.834 --> 37:27.708
AND BROWSING
IN INDEPENDENT
BOOKSTORES.

37:27.708 --> 37:29.041
WE HAVE A LOT
IN COMMON,
YOU AND I.

37:29.041 --> 37:29.917
WELL, IF YOU KNEW
WHAT I WAS DOING,

37:29.917 --> 37:31.542
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST STOP ME?

37:31.542 --> 37:34.041
BECAUSE IT WAS
OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

37:34.041 --> 37:35.625
WHAT'S LESS OBVIOUS
IS WHY,

37:35.625 --> 37:38.375
AND WE WILL TALK
ABOUT THAT
ON TUESDAY.

37:38.375 --> 37:41.083
WHY? CAN'T I JUST WANT
TO KNOW THINGS ABOUT YOU?

37:41.083 --> 37:42.417
I CAN'T JUST BE CURIOUS?

37:42.417 --> 37:43.750
ABOUT ME?

37:43.750 --> 37:45.250
I'M NOT REALLY ALL
THAT INTERESTING.

37:45.250 --> 37:46.917
I THINK THERE'S
SOME BIGGER QUESTION

37:46.917 --> 37:48.917
YOU NEEDED ANSWERED.

37:48.917 --> 37:51.250
WHAT--WHAT BIG QUESTION?

37:51.250 --> 37:52.834
TUESDAY.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.542
A CLUE.
WHAT?

37:54.542 --> 37:56.625
LIKE 5 LETTERS,
STARTS AND ENDS

37:56.625 --> 37:57.959
WITH THE SAME
CONSONANT?

37:57.959 --> 37:59.750
IT'S NOT
A CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.083
IT'S WHAT WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT
ON FRIDAY.

38:01.083 --> 38:02.959
YOU WERE THERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

38:02.959 --> 38:06.583
IN BODY,
IF NOT IN SPIRIT?

38:06.583 --> 38:09.417
TRUST.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.959
IS THAT THE QUESTION?

38:10.959 --> 38:11.917
AND WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

38:11.917 --> 38:14.083
YEAH.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.875
YES, THAT I CAN TRUST YOU.

38:23.333 --> 38:25.458
YOU KNOW, THIS PROBABLY
ISN'T THE BEST PLACE
FOR YOU TO HANG OUT

38:25.458 --> 38:28.583
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO AVOID ME.

38:28.583 --> 38:32.000
OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE
TRYING TO BREAK UP
WITH ME...

38:32.000 --> 38:33.750
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M PLANNING.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.625
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
AVOIDING ME.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.291
YEAH.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.291
IF I IN ANY WAY
GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION

38:42.291 --> 38:43.792
THAT I'M NOT OVER JOEY

38:43.792 --> 38:45.291
OR MADE YOU
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
UNIMPORTANT TO ME

38:45.291 --> 38:46.834
OR THAT I DON'T WANT
THIS TO WORK--

38:46.834 --> 38:47.792
THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.792
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG LAST NIGHT, DAWSON.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.333
ALL YOU WERE
WAS HONEST WITH ME.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.000
SO, THEN WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

39:00.583 --> 39:01.542
IS THIS ABOUT SEX?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.542
NO, IT'S NOT.

39:05.959 --> 39:08.667
LOOK, JUST
PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.500
ANYTHING.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.166
THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
AS HONEST WITH ME

39:12.166 --> 39:13.625
AS YOU WERE LAST NIGHT.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.291
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE HARDEST PART

39:16.291 --> 39:17.708
ABOUT HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP.

39:17.708 --> 39:19.625
I MEAN, IT'S SO MUCH HARDER
THAN SEX.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.458
YOU KNOW, TRUSTING SOMEONE

39:22.458 --> 39:25.166
IS LIKE THIS
GIGANTIC ACT OF FAITH.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.667
YOU KNOW,
YOU PUT IT OUT THERE

39:26.667 --> 39:28.125
AND YOU CAN
NEVER REALLY BE SURE

39:28.125 --> 39:30.625
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
GET IT BACK.

39:30.625 --> 39:32.250
AND SEX...

39:32.250 --> 39:35.000
SEX IS JUST MECHANICAL.
IT'S LIKE...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.083
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.

39:40.375 --> 39:43.083
AH, FUNNY YOU
SHOULD MENTION THAT,
ACTUALLY.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.208
WHY?
BECAUSE I GOT YOU
SOMETHING...

39:45.208 --> 39:47.041
IN CASE YOU WERE
DUMPING ME.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.792
ALTHOUGH, GIVEN
THE RECENT TURN
IN CONVERSATION,

39:48.792 --> 39:50.375
IT DOES SEEM
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

39:50.375 --> 39:51.542
WAIT. IN CASE I WAS
DUMPING YOU,

39:51.542 --> 39:52.542
YOU GOT ME A PRESENT?

39:52.542 --> 39:56.375
YEAH. WELL,
YOU CHANGED MY LIFE.

39:56.375 --> 39:57.875
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE WITHOUT

39:57.875 --> 40:00.041
SOME SMALL TOKEN
OF MY AFFECTION.

40:00.041 --> 40:01.875
SO, IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A PARTING GIFT.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.250
YEAH, EXACTLY.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.917
YOU LEFT YOUR
OLD ONE AT MY HOUSE,

40:09.917 --> 40:11.708
AND IT WAS
REALLY DISGUSTING.

40:11.708 --> 40:12.583
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO GET A NEW ONE,

40:12.583 --> 40:13.583
LIKE, EVERY
MILLENNIUM.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.041
I KNOW.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.708
THAT'S WHY
THEY PUT THE COLOR
ON THE BRISTLES.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.792
OK, I GET IT.
SHUT UP.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.041
THANK YOU.

40:22.041 --> 40:23.291
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:32.083 --> 40:35.250
IT'S A NICE THING
THAT DAWSON
JUST DID FOR YOU.

40:35.250 --> 40:37.917
WHY JUST FOR ME?

40:37.917 --> 40:39.041
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WAS SO UPSET

40:39.041 --> 40:40.333
BY THE WHOLE THING.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.583
YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD WE WALKED.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.250
IT'S REALLY NICE
OUT HERE.

40:46.250 --> 40:48.708
YEAH. IT'S NOT TOO COLD.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.125
IT'S KIND OF
FREAKY, ISN'T IT,

40:52.125 --> 40:53.291
THE WAY THE SNOW'S
ALL MELTED?

40:53.291 --> 40:55.250
LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
SPRING SOON

40:55.250 --> 40:58.417
AND WE DIDN'T
REALIZE.

40:58.417 --> 40:59.583
WELL, OUR NEW PASTIME

40:59.583 --> 41:01.375
IS MUCH MORE
OF AN INDOOR SPORT.

41:04.333 --> 41:05.917
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF WE SHOULD HAVE

41:05.917 --> 41:07.792
DONE IT ON THE BOAT,
YOU KNOW?

41:07.792 --> 41:09.583
WE WERE ALONE.

41:09.583 --> 41:13.417
NAH. WE WOULD'VE
MISSED ALL THE SCENERY.

41:13.417 --> 41:14.458
DO YOU MISS IT?

41:16.417 --> 41:17.792
THE SCENERY?

41:17.792 --> 41:20.291
NO.

41:20.291 --> 41:21.834
WHEN WE WEREN'T
HAVING SEX.

41:21.834 --> 41:23.458
WHEN EVERYTHING
AND EVERY MOMENT

41:23.458 --> 41:25.500
WASN'T ABOUT SEX.

41:27.458 --> 41:30.166
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT TIME EVER REALLY EXISTED.

41:30.166 --> 41:32.417
I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:32.417 --> 41:34.417
I MEAN, BEFORE...

41:34.417 --> 41:36.083
WHEN WE HADN'T
HAD SEX...

41:36.083 --> 41:37.458
EVERYTHING WAS
ABOUT SEX,

41:37.458 --> 41:39.917
AND NOW THAT
WE HAVE HAD SEX--

41:39.917 --> 41:41.458
EVERYTHING IS STILL
ABOUT SEX.

41:47.708 --> 41:49.417
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG?

41:50.959 --> 41:52.917
NO. DO YOU?

41:54.667 --> 41:55.667
NO.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.166
IF YOU DON'T THINK
THAT WE DID ANYTHING WRONG,
I WAS JUST--

42:00.166 --> 42:01.959
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHY THAT YOU WOULD...

42:04.291 --> 42:06.041
PACEY, DID GRETCHEN
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU

42:06.041 --> 42:07.333
AFTER I LEFT
THIS MORNING?

42:11.166 --> 42:12.125
MM-MMM. WHY?

42:15.041 --> 42:16.500
NO REASON.

42:20.792 --> 42:24.166
YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST
WALK SOME MORE. I MEAN...

42:24.166 --> 42:25.917
WE NEVER DO THAT ANYMORE.
