00:00.868 --> 00:04.210
[Dr. Jane Foster]
The Avengers are alive.

00:04.246 --> 00:06.939
I know for a fact that the Cabal
didn't disintegrate them.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.542
They just teleported them
away... far, far away.

00:14.857 --> 00:17.276
I discovered a way to back-trace the
missing Avengers through space-time.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.825
I can send you to them.

00:18.860 --> 00:20.577
These tethers
are your lifeline back.

00:20.612 --> 00:24.339
Find the Avengers, then activate
the tether to come home.

00:24.374 --> 00:26.866
Don't activate your tether until
you've found them. [Beeping]

00:26.902 --> 00:29.244
You will only
have one shot at this.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.514
Good luck.

00:32.549 --> 00:35.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa-ho, whoa, whoa! No
one said there would be any falling!

00:35.403 --> 00:37.069
[whiny yell]

00:41.934 --> 00:45.285
Okay. Looks like I'm here.
I think.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.933
Whoa! Tell me I did not
just travel through time.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.211
This looks like 1930s New York.

00:55.981 --> 00:58.140
[gasps]

00:58.175 --> 01:00.467
Except Arnim Zola's
running the place.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.225 --> 01:16.233
I'm in a world
run by Arnim Zola?

01:18.378 --> 01:21.021
[car approaching] Uh-oh!

01:21.056 --> 01:23.549
Gotta go small or go home!
[grunts]

01:23.584 --> 01:26.601
And Ant-Man is safe!

01:26.636 --> 01:28.895
Not really safe,
so much as Ant-Man not squished.

01:28.931 --> 01:32.649
[tires screeching]

01:32.684 --> 01:36.069
It's New York, all right.
But how?

01:36.104 --> 01:38.305
I need to find
the missing Avengers

01:38.382 --> 01:40.302
and figure out how and why
Arnim Zola's in charge.

01:40.326 --> 01:44.136
Wherever he goes, evil Hydra
goons can't be far behind.

01:50.093 --> 01:52.269
[tires screech]

01:56.216 --> 01:57.899
[grunts]

01:59.995 --> 02:02.179
I tell ya, these yeggs
are everywhere.

02:02.214 --> 02:04.014
We're never gonna get
the apples at this rate.

02:05.743 --> 02:06.967
[both grunt]

02:07.002 --> 02:10.187
Hawkeye... [grunts]

02:10.222 --> 02:12.422
How long do you plan
to keep talking like this?

02:12.457 --> 02:14.641
I don't know.
How long we got, pally?

02:14.677 --> 02:17.719
[brakes screech]
[Ant-Man yells, grunts]

02:17.754 --> 02:19.946
I was on a Hydra car?

02:19.981 --> 02:21.661
Explains why they ran
all those red lights.

02:22.759 --> 02:25.393
Is that... It is them!

02:25.428 --> 02:28.063
Black Widow and Hawkeye!
Hold on!

02:28.098 --> 02:30.624
[blows landing] Huh?

02:30.659 --> 02:32.942
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

02:32.977 --> 02:35.487
Ant-Man. Elevator,

02:35.522 --> 02:38.114
going down! [Yells]

02:38.149 --> 02:41.351
Hello. What have we... [grunts]

02:41.386 --> 02:42.819
Whoa!

02:44.815 --> 02:47.298
[grunts, groans]

02:47.334 --> 02:49.910
Hail Hy... [grunts]
Captain America!

02:49.945 --> 02:51.962
[weapon cocking]

02:51.997 --> 02:55.290
Take cover, soldier! [Grunts]

02:55.325 --> 02:58.159
Aw! This kind of thing
never happened to my old shield.

02:58.195 --> 03:00.337
Ant-Man, see if you can get to it.
[grunts]

03:04.543 --> 03:06.234
Hey, Hydra goon!

03:06.270 --> 03:08.202
[singsongy]
This is me distracting you.

03:08.238 --> 03:09.512
[grunts]

03:12.150 --> 03:13.600
This last one's still kicking.

03:15.037 --> 03:16.386
[grunts]

03:16.421 --> 03:17.637
[grunts]

03:17.672 --> 03:19.556
[groans]

03:19.591 --> 03:22.259
Well, Cap, what's the good word?

03:22.294 --> 03:25.094
Did it work this time?
We got what we came for.

03:25.129 --> 03:27.205
Then let's make tracks, boys.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.973
Ooh, nice use of the lingo.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.800
[grunts]

03:30.836 --> 03:31.956
[glass shatters] [cat yowls]

03:31.987 --> 03:33.486
Ooh.

03:33.521 --> 03:35.205
Sorry.

03:37.476 --> 03:42.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait. So
we're not in 1930s New York?

03:42.255 --> 03:43.983
[Captain America] As far as we can tell,
this is another world in space-time

03:44.007 --> 03:46.475
known as Dimension Z.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.877
It used to be a pocket world
with free citizens.

03:48.912 --> 03:51.154
But now it's ruled
by Arnim Zola.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.506
That explains all the Zola
poster art everywhere.

03:53.542 --> 03:56.676
Zola captured us when we
arrived, but we escaped.

03:56.711 --> 03:59.348
Ever since, we've been running a
guerilla campaign to bring him down.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.073
And this is the doohickey
that's gonna do it.

04:02.108 --> 04:05.155
We're building this antenna arrow with
pieces Cap grabbed from the radio tower.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.262
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

04:07.297 --> 04:09.280
Now that I found you,
I can bring you guys home.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.850
Dr. Foster built
a trans-dimensional tether.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.961
I just need to hit both buttons,
and we are off. [Beeps]

04:14.996 --> 04:17.213
â™ª [big band on radio]

04:17.249 --> 04:21.184
Uh, guys, I'm here to rescue you.
I don't even get a smile?

04:21.219 --> 04:25.538
We're not going anywhere, short pants.
Not yet, at least.

04:25.573 --> 04:28.583
Arnim Zola has the people of
Dimension Z under his iron boot.

04:28.619 --> 04:31.619
We can't just abandon them
and leave him in control.

04:31.655 --> 04:34.488
We have to free them, and that
means freeing the entire world.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.283
Okay. Of course. No problem.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.795
Arnim Zola runs the grid here.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.147
I can just whip up a quick
EMP, zap all the electronics,

04:42.182 --> 04:45.901
and bye-bye bad guy.
It's not that simple.

04:45.936 --> 04:48.669
Zola's wired into everything in
Dimension Z, including the people.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.905
Those little thingies
on their necks.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.982
Zola has cybernetic implants
in everyone.

04:53.018 --> 04:57.362
The populace follows Zola's
orders, or he'll fry them.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.564
An EMP would risk hurting
the people we wanna save.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.875
Only one way to stop Zola.
This doohickey.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.628
Are you still doing that?

05:04.663 --> 05:08.590
What? I'm just trying to use the lingo.
Talk like a local.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.192
Zola's link has to be
severed at the source.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.014
It's the only way to free the people.
[static on radio]

05:13.038 --> 05:14.980
[Arnim Zola]
Free them from what?

05:15.015 --> 05:17.324
[laughing] Freedom is a lie,

05:17.359 --> 05:19.917
star-spangled fool.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.070
How did he find us?

05:22.072 --> 05:24.281
[beeping softly] [Hawkeye]
Scott's the hot potato.

05:24.316 --> 05:26.149
One of Zola's gunsels
must've tagged him.

05:29.271 --> 05:31.888
[singsongy] Peekaboo. I see you.

05:31.923 --> 05:34.332
[normal voice] All of you.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.877
So this is the hole
where the Captain

05:36.912 --> 05:38.862
and his compatriots
have been hiding.

05:38.897 --> 05:41.539
But it's my world,

05:41.574 --> 05:44.000
and I cannot allow your
little clubhouse to exist.

05:44.035 --> 05:46.319
This is a raid!

05:46.355 --> 05:47.355
[thunderous thud]

05:49.066 --> 05:50.590
[weapons cocking]

05:50.625 --> 05:52.258
Destroy them!

05:56.214 --> 05:58.515
Destroy them!

06:01.911 --> 06:04.587
Avengers, send
the party crashers out!

06:04.623 --> 06:06.565
[grunts]

06:06.600 --> 06:08.349
You heard Cap!

06:08.384 --> 06:10.026
[grunts]

06:11.972 --> 06:16.007
Out you go! Tiny insect!

06:16.043 --> 06:18.468
Hope you're thirsty! [Grunts]

06:18.503 --> 06:21.554
[grunting]

06:21.590 --> 06:25.107
Bronx Bum sliding into home plate!
[grunts]

06:25.143 --> 06:28.011
Obnoxious archer!

06:28.046 --> 06:32.966
I'll see you suffer for that.
[grunts]

06:33.001 --> 06:37.354
And it's not "Bronx Bum." It's
"Brooklyn Bum," ya wet sock.

06:37.389 --> 06:39.797
"Wet sock"?
Oh, I'm totally using that.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.933
[grunts]

06:41.968 --> 06:45.636
[all grunting]

06:45.672 --> 06:47.466
More coming. We need to
bust our way outta here.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.958
[crying out]

06:49.993 --> 06:52.444
Hawkeye! [Grunts]

06:52.479 --> 06:55.130
I'm pinned down!

06:55.165 --> 06:56.823
[grunting continues]

06:56.858 --> 06:58.207
I've got him!

06:58.242 --> 07:01.353
Oh, no, Mein Captain.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.955
You can't help the archer.
You have your own problems.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.916
[crying out]

07:09.972 --> 07:12.380
Hold on!
Teeny-tiny help is on the way!

07:13.950 --> 07:16.000
[grunts, groans]

07:16.035 --> 07:17.193
Scott! [Grunts]

07:17.228 --> 07:19.587
Wunderbar.

07:19.623 --> 07:23.600
You can do nothing without this,
can you, little insect?

07:25.954 --> 07:28.672
Bring them! And evacuate
this den of criminals!

07:28.707 --> 07:33.968
It appears to be, uh,
structurally unsound. [Beeping]

07:34.003 --> 07:36.170
[beeping speeds up] [gasps]

07:36.206 --> 07:38.615
Fire in the hole! [Grunts]

07:48.042 --> 07:50.017
[coughing] Come on.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.287
They've got Cap and Hawkeye!

07:52.322 --> 07:54.797
Wait. [Grunts]

07:54.832 --> 07:56.732
You can't just go running off!
[grunts]

07:56.768 --> 07:58.509
Zola's eyes and ears
are everywhere.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.470
We need to be stealthy
and inconspicuous.

08:07.145 --> 08:11.748
I can do stealthy and inconspicuous
when I have my helmet.

08:11.783 --> 08:16.627
Which Zola now has, which means I have
no tech, which means I have no powers.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.647
You were a thief
before you were Ant-Man.

08:19.683 --> 08:21.343
And from what I read in the
files, a pretty good one.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.309
You read my files? All of them?

08:23.345 --> 08:25.094
Mm-hmm.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.130
And very good. I was very good.

08:28.166 --> 08:32.885
But it's still easier to sneak around
when I'm, you know, ant-sized.

08:32.921 --> 08:36.289
You'll just have to fall back
on your very good thief skills.

08:36.325 --> 08:38.750
You can do it. It'll just
be a little hard work.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.510
Yeah, but I hate hard work.

08:42.130 --> 08:46.107
Ew.

08:46.142 --> 08:48.529
[Hydra enforcer] Master Zola has ordered
us to take their weapons to the vault

08:48.553 --> 08:50.979
and prepare these two
for assimilation.

09:05.195 --> 09:08.529
Zola probably took Cap and Hawkeye
back to his headquarters,

09:08.565 --> 09:11.891
which is bad because we've
never been able to find it.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.511
How is it possible you've never
found Zola's headquarters?

09:14.546 --> 09:16.663
Too busy staying ahead
of his bully boys.

09:16.698 --> 09:19.382
Then, too busy
trying to fight back.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.492
Zola has a lot
of scary buildings.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.645
We don't know which one
is his base.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.839
An entire world
that he molded himself,

09:25.874 --> 09:27.965
and he made it the 1930s?

09:28.001 --> 09:31.519
Huh. Throwback to a quieter,
simpler time?

09:31.554 --> 09:35.356
No. Throwback to before Captain
America kicked Hydra's butt.

09:35.391 --> 09:38.176
Yeah. That makes sense.
[buttons beeping]

09:38.211 --> 09:39.956
I'm not getting any signal
that I can trace back to Zola.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.597
No Wi, no Fi.

09:42.632 --> 09:46.892
This whole old-timey thing
is a pain in my...

09:46.928 --> 09:51.030
But if Zola's not using wireless,
then things have to be wired.

09:51.065 --> 09:57.011
Like hardwired. Like actual wires
carrying Arnim Zola's signals.

09:57.046 --> 10:00.465
Better roll up our sleeves, because we're
about to get our hands really dirty.

10:07.890 --> 10:10.199
A control freak like Arnim Zola

10:10.235 --> 10:12.810
is gonna have all this
linked to some central hub.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.296
So if we can follow the pattern
of the city's wiring...

10:15.332 --> 10:18.449
[Black Widow] It'll lead us right
to Zola's secret headquarters.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.301
[electricity arcing] [chuckles]

10:20.337 --> 10:23.947
[painful grunting]

10:23.982 --> 10:26.741
Forget it, Zola.

10:26.776 --> 10:29.744
I'll die before I submit to you,
and we both know it.

10:33.941 --> 10:36.509
Indeed.

10:36.586 --> 10:40.163
But will you sacrifice
someone else in your stead?

10:40.198 --> 10:43.733
Hey, Zola, you are hideous.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.935
But I bet you hear that
from everyone you meet.

10:45.971 --> 10:48.471
[screaming]

10:50.616 --> 10:53.609
Hawkeye!
Arnim Zola, you let him go!

10:53.644 --> 10:57.004
Cap, forget about me.

10:57.039 --> 10:59.598
Don't give Zola a thing!
[screaming]

10:59.634 --> 11:04.637
A few more jolts will be
the end of poor Hawkeye.

11:04.672 --> 11:08.182
Oh, if only someone
might help him.

11:08.218 --> 11:10.476
Shut it off, Zola.

11:10.511 --> 11:11.973
I won't let my friends be hurt
because of me.

11:11.997 --> 11:16.958
I had a feeling you would
come around to see it my way.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.678
[cries out, groans]

11:20.714 --> 11:23.931
Cap, don't!

11:23.967 --> 11:28.035
I'm buying you time, Hawkeye.
Forget me, but save everyone else.

11:28.070 --> 11:31.197
[crying out] [chuckling]

11:31.232 --> 11:33.099
[electricity arcing]

11:33.134 --> 11:35.267
We found them.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.712
We don't have a moment to lose.

11:37.747 --> 11:40.214
[electricity arcing continues]
What are you doing to Cap?

11:40.249 --> 11:42.416
You will see soon enough,
archer.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.769
You will all... [crashing]

11:44.804 --> 11:48.439
What? Interlopers!

11:48.474 --> 11:49.474
[grunts]

11:57.300 --> 11:59.291
We gotta get Cap out.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.654
Not this time. You are too late.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.173
Doughboys, keep them away
from the Captain.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.805
[grunts]

12:15.201 --> 12:16.201
[grunts]

12:21.074 --> 12:23.232
[grunting]

12:29.157 --> 12:32.091
He got my weapon!
Welcome to the party.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.946
Some tall, ugly goon took
our gear when we got here.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.220
Natasha!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.788
One-two punch! One!

12:39.325 --> 12:40.958
Two!

12:46.374 --> 12:49.417
Doughboys... soft in the middle,
fried on the outside.

12:49.452 --> 12:51.836
Keep these things busy.
Yeah, sure.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.013
We'll just form a conga line
or something. [Grunting]

12:55.742 --> 12:57.258
Sulfur,

12:57.293 --> 12:59.043
coal,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.003
potassium nitrate,

13:01.038 --> 13:03.172
diamonds, for some reason...

13:03.208 --> 13:06.476
[grunts]

13:06.511 --> 13:09.379
What is that insect doing?

13:09.414 --> 13:12.347
Just doing a little science, a little
chemistry, a little homemade rocket.

13:12.383 --> 13:13.383
Natasha!

13:13.417 --> 13:16.244
[grunting]

13:16.279 --> 13:19.288
Huh? [Grunting]

13:21.551 --> 13:23.042
Three, two, one, blastoff!

13:24.862 --> 13:27.421
N-N-No!

13:30.168 --> 13:32.452
Ughh!

13:32.487 --> 13:34.087
[Black Widow] Hurry!
Get Cap outta there!

13:39.719 --> 13:42.228
It's okay, Cap.

13:42.264 --> 13:43.971
We gotcha.
Everything's gonna be...

13:44.006 --> 13:45.773
[static]

13:48.210 --> 13:50.953
Yes, please, archer, go on.

13:50.988 --> 13:53.797
"Everything will be"...

13:53.833 --> 13:56.584
Everybody okay with me
throwing up now?

13:56.619 --> 14:00.246
Tiny minds. Such limited scope.

14:00.282 --> 14:04.284
Do you not see? No more robots.

14:04.319 --> 14:08.195
No more computers.
My consciousness

14:08.230 --> 14:11.482
has now melded
with a strong body,

14:11.518 --> 14:14.935
one that will never burn out!

14:14.971 --> 14:18.355
[Black Widow] Cap, if you're still
inside there, fight Zola's control!

14:18.391 --> 14:21.183
Hail Hydra.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.681
[laughing]

14:27.717 --> 14:30.768
The assimilation process
is nearly complete.

14:30.804 --> 14:35.481
Soon Armin Zola will be
the true bermensch.

14:35.517 --> 14:39.586
I shall rewrite history
here in Dimension Z.

14:39.662 --> 14:43.439
There shall be order.
There shall be perfection.

14:43.474 --> 14:47.835
The world of Arnim Zola
shall be law!

14:47.870 --> 14:50.480
Dream on, Zola.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.090
[Avengers grunting]

14:55.286 --> 14:58.537
Yeah! [Laughing]

14:58.573 --> 15:00.848
[grunts, chuckles]

15:02.560 --> 15:05.094
[both grunt]

15:05.129 --> 15:08.222
[laughs] So slow.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.817
You are too afraid of hurting
your precious Captain.

15:11.852 --> 15:15.112
While I have no such compunction.
[yells]

15:15.148 --> 15:18.991
[grunts]
We have to stop this fast,

15:19.026 --> 15:21.252
or else Zola's going to have
Cap's body permanently!

15:21.287 --> 15:23.746
[laughs] Working on it!

15:23.781 --> 15:26.415
[both grunting]

15:29.337 --> 15:31.971
[both grunt]

15:32.006 --> 15:34.056
Still waiting on that plan.

15:34.091 --> 15:36.850
Still working on it. Amazing!

15:36.886 --> 15:39.528
Exhilarating!

15:39.564 --> 15:42.498
To think the Captain
had such raw physical power,

15:42.533 --> 15:46.953
but his brain never received
the right impulses to use it.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.855
[grunting]

15:52.452 --> 15:54.736
Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.

15:54.771 --> 15:55.778
[grunts, yells]

15:57.916 --> 16:00.808
Tall, ugly goon,
just like Hawkeye said.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.752
[grunting] Hey!

16:02.787 --> 16:04.996
His words, not mine. [Chuckles]

16:05.031 --> 16:07.223
[both grunting]

16:07.258 --> 16:11.293
I bet you're a decent sort of
guy when you're not being evil.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.898
I've been fighting bigger guys
all my life.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.185
[grunting]

16:19.220 --> 16:20.994
Fighting and winning.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.989
Jackpot!

16:24.025 --> 16:25.658
[growls] Hold that thought.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.226
[grunting]

16:30.256 --> 16:34.033
[Zola] As a little one,
I could only dream

16:34.110 --> 16:35.950
of growing up to be big
and strong and perfect.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.264
The dream has now
become reality.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.725
[grunts]

16:42.760 --> 16:46.779
You can never defeat me.
[both grunt]

16:46.814 --> 16:50.198
I am the world's
greatest soldier

16:50.234 --> 16:54.770
but without his morals,
without his restraint.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.306
Jeez, I wish you'd
restrain your mouth.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.245
You gonna talk us to death,
or... Arrow delivery.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.761
[growls] [laughs] Now
we're cookin' with gas.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.799
[grunting]

17:06.834 --> 17:09.459
[yells]

17:09.494 --> 17:11.012
[groans]

17:11.047 --> 17:13.021
Ouch! Right in the kisser.

17:13.057 --> 17:14.857
Do your worst.

17:14.892 --> 17:20.212
You have no idea what a
super-soldier is capable of

17:20.248 --> 17:23.549
with a superior mind in command.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.285
You can never defeat Captain America.
[grunts]

17:26.320 --> 17:27.661
[Captain America grunts]

17:27.696 --> 17:30.314
Hawkeye, get set! Set!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.742
[grunts]

17:32.777 --> 17:35.620
[growls] What? [Static]

17:35.655 --> 17:38.080
I'm no doctor, [grunts]

17:38.116 --> 17:40.416
But these cybernetic implants'll
have to go.

17:40.451 --> 17:42.760
Besides, the future is wireless.

17:42.795 --> 17:46.622
You cannot do this!
Not to me! Not to...

17:46.657 --> 17:47.881
[Captain America] ...me!

17:47.916 --> 17:49.058
Aahh!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.312
[exhales]

17:53.347 --> 17:57.183
That was... pretty awful.
[shield clangs on ground]

17:57.218 --> 18:01.069
So, did Zola just
burn himself out?

18:01.105 --> 18:03.656
Zola had an ant problem.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.934
Did I just save Captain America?
Whoo-hoo!

18:06.969 --> 18:10.529
I think I did! I think I
just saved Captain America!

18:10.564 --> 18:12.548
Whoo-hoo! Tiny dance time!

18:12.584 --> 18:14.366
Ugh! Whoo...

18:14.401 --> 18:15.717
[laughs]

18:15.753 --> 18:18.462
Ant-Man! No!

18:18.497 --> 18:22.257
Your minds are truly as tiny
as your insect friend.

18:22.292 --> 18:26.929
And I will crush you,
just as I did him.

18:26.964 --> 18:31.508
Stick to the plan and end this. Don't
let Ant-Man's sacrifice be wasted.

18:31.543 --> 18:36.104
Bah! I may be back in this cold,
metallic shell for the moment,

18:36.140 --> 18:38.949
but your body
will be mine again!

18:38.984 --> 18:40.568
Then come and get it.

18:42.296 --> 18:45.380
[grunting]

18:45.416 --> 18:48.734
[Zola] I will crush you!
Break you!

18:48.769 --> 18:50.678
Not on your best day, Zola!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.204
[grunting]

18:54.709 --> 18:56.367
Good to go.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.877
[grunts]

19:00.381 --> 19:01.964
[both grunt]

19:05.711 --> 19:08.721
[both grunting]

19:12.902 --> 19:15.710
[crying out]

19:15.746 --> 19:18.614
[groans]

19:18.650 --> 19:20.232
[both grunt]

19:22.745 --> 19:26.997
You see? I am the superior.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.674
You cannot defeat me.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.152
It was never about beating you.

19:32.188 --> 19:34.463
It was about freeing
the people of Dimension Z.

19:34.499 --> 19:35.499
Hawkeye, now!

19:37.793 --> 19:39.544
[grunts] [beeping]

19:39.579 --> 19:41.570
Huh? [Static]

19:41.605 --> 19:43.898
[static stops] [chuckles]

19:43.933 --> 19:46.341
It didn't activate.

19:46.377 --> 19:49.503
Failures! All of you, failures!

19:49.538 --> 19:52.331
[laughs] I will... [static]

19:52.366 --> 19:54.833
I will... [grunts]
[Ant-Man] Hey, big face!

19:54.869 --> 19:56.402
Ant-Man!

19:56.437 --> 19:57.544
Getting my hands dirty.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.129
[grunts]

19:59.165 --> 20:00.731
Show's over, Zola.

20:02.110 --> 20:05.561
[straining]

20:05.596 --> 20:08.005
[altered voice]
Ring-a-ding-ding.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.973
[altered voice â™ª2]
I'm no stool pigeon.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.566
Scram, kid. Ya bother me.

20:11.602 --> 20:14.670
[altered voice â™ª1] I didn't
come here to be insulted.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.964
[altered voice â™ª2 laughs]
That's what you think!

20:16.966 --> 20:20.175
[normal voice] Ants... Ants inside me!
[whirring]

20:20.210 --> 20:23.295
Stop! Get out of there!

20:23.331 --> 20:26.473
Ant-Man! [Whirring intensifies]

20:26.509 --> 20:27.616
No!

20:27.652 --> 20:31.095
Nooooo!

20:36.177 --> 20:39.494
You actually did it. We did it.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.606
That antenna arrow
was a nice bit of tech, Hawkeye.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.785
Oh, and, uh, I grabbed
a little souvenir on my way out.

20:45.820 --> 20:50.030
Armin Zola's mind
right here on this chip.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.545
Looks like Zola couldn't get by
with the low-tech thing either.

20:55.404 --> 20:59.673
Arnim Zola's control,
and this shield, are no more.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.708
[citizens cheering] [grunts]

21:01.744 --> 21:03.024
[shield pieces clatter
on ground]

21:04.838 --> 21:06.880
[descending whirring]

21:09.644 --> 21:11.860
[Ant-Man] This all would
have gone a lot easier

21:11.896 --> 21:14.138
if we'd had some
actual modern tech.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.542
[Black Widow] We did
something great here today.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.858
Dimension Z is free.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.844
[Hawkeye] Yeah, little buddy.
Take the win.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.287
Please don't
call me "little buddy."

21:22.322 --> 21:24.748
Always try to leave a place
better than when you got there.

21:24.784 --> 21:32.784
Let's go home. [Button beeps]
