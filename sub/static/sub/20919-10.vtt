I know for a fact that the Cabal
didn't disintegrate them.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.542
They just teleported them
away... far, far away.

00:14.857 --> 00:17.276
I discovered a way to back-trace the
missing Avengers through space-time.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.825
I can send you to them.

00:18.860 --> 00:20.577
These tethers

00:20.612 --> 00:24.339
Find the Avengers, then activate
the tether to come home.

Don't activate your tether until
you've found them. [Beeping]

00:26.902 --> 00:29.244
You will only
have one shot at this.

Okay. Looks like I'm here.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.933
Whoa! Tell me I did not
just travel through time.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.211

Arnim Zola's in charge.

[Captain America] As far as we can tell,
this is another world in space-time

It used to be a pocket world

03:48.912 --> 03:51.154
But now it's ruled
by Arnim Zola.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.506
That explains all the Zola

Zola captured us when we
arrived, but we escaped.

Ever since, we've been running a

We're not going anywhere, short pants.

04:25.573 --> 04:28.583
Arnim Zola has the people of
Dimension Z under his iron boot.

We can't just abandon them

I can do stealthy and inconspicuous

for assimilation.

09:05.195 --> 09:08.529
Zola probably took Cap and Hawkeye
back to his headquarters,

never been able to find it.

of scary buildings.

We don't know which one
is his base.

that he molded himself,

09:25.874 --> 09:27.965
and he made it the 1930s?

09:28.001 --> 09:31.519
Huh. Throwback to a quieter,
simpler time?

09:31.554 --> 09:35.356
No. Throwback to before Captain
America kicked Hydra's butt.

09:35.391 --> 09:38.176
Yeah. That makes sense.

then things have to be wired.

carrying Arnim Zola's signals.

Better roll up our sleeves, because we're
about to get our hands really dirty.

10:07.890 --> 10:10.199
A control freak like Arnim Zola

10:10.235 --> 10:12.810
is gonna have all this
linked to some central hub.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.296
So if we can follow the pattern
of the city's wiring...

10:15.332 --> 10:18.449

to Zola's secret headquarters.

12:29.157 --> 12:32.091
He got my weapon!
Welcome to the party.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.946
Some tall, ugly goon took
our gear when we got here.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.220
Natasha!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.788
One-two punch! One!

12:39.325 --> 12:40.958
Two!

12:46.374 --> 12:49.417
Doughboys... soft in the middle,
fried on the outside.

12:49.452 --> 12:51.836
Keep these things busy.
Yeah, sure.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.013
We'll just form a conga line
or something. [Grunting]

12:55.742 --> 12:57.258
Sulfur,

12:57.293 --> 12:59.043
coal,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.003
potassium nitrate,

13:01.038 --> 13:03.172
diamonds, for some reason...

13:03.208 --> 13:06.476
[grunts]

13:06.511 --> 13:09.379
What is that insect doing?

13:09.414 --> 13:12.347
Just doing a little science, a little
chemistry, a little homemade rocket.

13:12.383 --> 13:13.383
Natasha!

13:13.417 --> 13:16.244
[grunting]

13:16.279 --> 13:19.288
Huh? [Grunting]

13:21.551 --> 13:23.042
Three, two, one, blastoff!

13:24.862 --> 13:27.421
N-N-No!

13:30.168 --> 13:32.452
Ughh!

13:32.487 --> 13:34.087
[Black Widow] Hurry!
Get Cap outta there!

13:39.719 --> 13:42.228
It's okay, Cap.

13:42.264 --> 13:43.971
We gotcha.
Everything's gonna be...

13:44.006 --> 13:45.773
[static]

13:48.210 --> 13:50.953
Yes, please, archer, go on.

13:50.988 --> 13:53.797
"Everything will be"...

13:53.833 --> 13:56.584
Everybody okay with me
throwing up now?

13:56.619 --> 14:00.246
Tiny minds. Such limited scope.

14:00.282 --> 14:04.284
Do you not see? No more robots.

14:04.319 --> 14:08.195
No more computers.
My consciousness

14:08.230 --> 14:11.482
has now melded
with a strong body,

14:11.518 --> 14:14.935
one that will never burn out!

14:14.971 --> 14:18.355
[Black Widow] Cap, if you're still
inside there, fight Zola's control!

14:18.391 --> 14:21.183
Hail Hydra.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.681
[laughing]

14:27.717 --> 14:30.768
The assimilation process
is nearly complete.

14:30.804 --> 14:35.481
Soon Armin Zola will be
the true bermensch.

14:35.517 --> 14:39.586
I shall rewrite history
here in Dimension Z.

14:39.662 --> 14:43.439
There shall be order.
There shall be perfection.

14:43.474 --> 14:47.835
The world of Arnim Zola
shall be law!

14:47.870 --> 14:50.480
Dream on, Zola.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.090
[Avengers grunting]

14:55.286 --> 14:58.537
Yeah! [Laughing]

14:58.573 --> 15:00.848
[grunts, chuckles]

15:02.560 --> 15:05.094
[both grunt]

15:05.129 --> 15:08.222
[laughs] So slow.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.817
You are too afraid of hurting
your precious Captain.

15:11.852 --> 15:15.112
While I have no such compunction.
[yells]

15:15.148 --> 15:18.991
[grunts]
We have to stop this fast,

15:19.026 --> 15:21.252
or else Zola's going to have
Cap's body permanently!

15:21.287 --> 15:23.746
[laughs] Working on it!

15:23.781 --> 15:26.415
[both grunting]

15:29.337 --> 15:31.971
[both grunt]

15:32.006 --> 15:34.056
Still waiting on that plan.

15:34.091 --> 15:36.850
Still working on it. Amazing!

15:36.886 --> 15:39.528
Exhilarating!

15:39.564 --> 15:42.498
To think the Captain
had such raw physical power,

15:42.533 --> 15:46.953
but his brain never received
the right impulses to use it.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.855
[grunting]

15:52.452 --> 15:54.736
Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.

15:54.771 --> 15:55.778
[grunts, yells]

15:57.916 --> 16:00.808
Tall, ugly goon,
just like Hawkeye said.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.752
[grunting] Hey!

16:02.787 --> 16:04.996
His words, not mine. [Chuckles]

16:05.031 --> 16:07.223
[both grunting]

16:07.258 --> 16:11.293
I bet you're a decent sort of
guy when you're not being evil.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.898
I've been fighting bigger guys
all my life.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.185
[grunting]

16:19.220 --> 16:20.994
Fighting and winning.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.989
Jackpot!

16:24.025 --> 16:25.658
[growls] Hold that thought.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.226
[grunting]

16:30.256 --> 16:34.033
[Zola] As a little one,
I could only dream

16:34.110 --> 16:35.950
of growing up to be big
and strong and perfect.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.264
The dream has now
become reality.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.725
[grunts]

16:42.760 --> 16:46.779
You can never defeat me.
[both grunt]

16:46.814 --> 16:50.198
I am the world's
greatest soldier

16:50.234 --> 16:54.770
but without his morals,
without his restraint.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.306
Jeez, I wish you'd
restrain your mouth.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.245
You gonna talk us to death,
or... Arrow delivery.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.761
[growls] [laughs] Now
we're cookin' with gas.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.799
[grunting]

17:06.834 --> 17:09.459
[yells]

17:09.494 --> 17:11.012
[groans]

17:11.047 --> 17:13.021
Ouch! Right in the kisser.

17:13.057 --> 17:14.857
Do your worst.

17:14.892 --> 17:20.212
You have no idea what a
super-soldier is capable of

17:20.248 --> 17:23.549
with a superior mind in command.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.285
You can never defeat Captain America.
[grunts]

17:26.320 --> 17:27.661
[Captain America grunts]

17:27.696 --> 17:30.314
Hawkeye, get set! Set!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.742
[grunts]

17:32.777 --> 17:35.620
[growls] What? [Static]

17:35.655 --> 17:38.080
I'm no doctor, [grunts]

17:38.116 --> 17:40.416
But these cybernetic implants'll
have to go.

17:40.451 --> 17:42.760
Besides, the future is wireless.

17:42.795 --> 17:46.622
You cannot do this!
Not to me! Not to...

17:46.657 --> 17:47.881
[Captain America] ...me!

17:47.916 --> 17:49.058
Aahh!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.312
[exhales]

17:53.347 --> 17:57.183
That was... pretty awful.
[shield clangs on ground]

17:57.218 --> 18:01.069
So, did Zola just
burn himself out?

18:01.105 --> 18:03.656
Zola had an ant problem.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.934
Did I just save Captain America?
Whoo-hoo!

18:06.969 --> 18:10.529
I think I did! I think I
just saved Captain America!

18:10.564 --> 18:12.548
Whoo-hoo! Tiny dance time!

18:12.584 --> 18:14.366
Ugh! Whoo...

18:14.401 --> 18:15.717
[laughs]

18:15.753 --> 18:18.462
Ant-Man! No!

18:18.497 --> 18:22.257
Your minds are truly as tiny
as your insect friend.

18:22.292 --> 18:26.929
And I will crush you,
just as I did him.

18:26.964 --> 18:31.508
Stick to the plan and end this. Don't
let Ant-Man's sacrifice be wasted.

18:31.543 --> 18:36.104
Bah! I may be back in this cold,
metallic shell for the moment,

18:36.140 --> 18:38.949
but your body
will be mine again!

18:38.984 --> 18:40.568
Then come and get it.

18:42.296 --> 18:45.380
[grunting]

18:45.416 --> 18:48.734
[Zola] I will crush you!
Break you!

18:48.769 --> 18:50.678
Not on your best day, Zola!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.204
[grunting]

18:54.709 --> 18:56.367
Good to go.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.877
[grunts]

19:00.381 --> 19:01.964
[both grunt]

19:05.711 --> 19:08.721
[both grunting]

19:12.902 --> 19:15.710
[crying out]

19:15.746 --> 19:18.614
[groans]

19:18.650 --> 19:20.232
[both grunt]

19:22.745 --> 19:26.997
You see? I am the superior.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.674
You cannot defeat me.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.152
It was never about beating you.

19:32.188 --> 19:34.463
It was about freeing
the people of Dimension Z.

19:34.499 --> 19:35.499
Hawkeye, now!

19:37.793 --> 19:39.544
[grunts] [beeping]

19:39.579 --> 19:41.570
Huh? [Static]

19:41.605 --> 19:43.898
[static stops] [chuckles]

19:43.933 --> 19:46.341
It didn't activate.

19:46.377 --> 19:49.503
Failures! All of you, failures!

19:49.538 --> 19:52.331
[laughs] I will... [static]

19:52.366 --> 19:54.833
I will... [grunts]
[Ant-Man] Hey, big face!

19:54.869 --> 19:56.402
Ant-Man!

19:56.437 --> 19:57.544
Getting my hands dirty.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.129
[grunts]

19:59.165 --> 20:00.731
Show's over, Zola.

20:02.110 --> 20:05.561
[straining]

20:05.596 --> 20:08.005
[altered voice]
Ring-a-ding-ding.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.973
[altered voice ♪2]
I'm no stool pigeon.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.566
Scram, kid. Ya bother me.

20:11.602 --> 20:14.670
[altered voice ♪1] I didn't
come here to be insulted.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.964
[altered voice ♪2 laughs]
That's what you think!

20:16.966 --> 20:20.175
[normal voice] Ants... Ants inside me!
[whirring]

20:20.210 --> 20:23.295
Stop! Get out of there!

20:23.331 --> 20:26.473
Ant-Man! [Whirring intensifies]

20:26.509 --> 20:27.616
No!

20:27.652 --> 20:31.095
Nooooo!

20:36.177 --> 20:39.494
You actually did it. We did it.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.606
That antenna arrow
was a nice bit of tech, Hawkeye.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.785
Oh, and, uh, I grabbed
a little souvenir on my way out.

20:45.820 --> 20:50.030
Armin Zola's mind
right here on this chip.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.545
Looks like Zola couldn't get by
with the low-tech thing either.

20:55.404 --> 20:59.673
Arnim Zola's control,
and this shield, are no more.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.708
[citizens cheering] [grunts]

21:01.744 --> 21:03.024
[shield pieces clatter
on ground]

21:04.838 --> 21:06.880
[descending whirring]

21:09.644 --> 21:11.860
[Ant-Man] This all would
have gone a lot easier

21:11.896 --> 21:14.138
if we'd had some
actual modern tech.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.542
[Black Widow] We did
something great here today.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.858
Dimension Z is free.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.844
[Hawkeye] Yeah, little buddy.
Take the win.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.287
Please don't
call me "little buddy."

21:22.322 --> 21:24.748
Always try to leave a place
better than when you got there.

21:24.784 --> 21:32.784
