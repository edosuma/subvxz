<i>It's called speed chess.</i>

00:06.213 --> 00:08.798
You get the concept, right? Speed. Fast.

00:08.807 --> 00:11.078
- You didn't answer the question.
- About your ex's wedding?

00:11.079 --> 00:13.238
All I've done today
is answer that question.

00:13.248 --> 00:14.348
New question.

00:14.372 --> 00:15.834
Things are going great with Erica.

00:15.858 --> 00:16.977
We're really connecting.

00:17.001 --> 00:18.827
Should I bring her to the wedding?

00:19.253 --> 00:21.399
Sure. Yes. Definitely.

00:21.423 --> 00:23.248
Bring Erica to Natalie's wedding.

00:23.258 --> 00:24.560
What if the wedding
makes her uncomfortable?

00:24.584 --> 00:26.117
Am I rocking the boat?

00:26.141 --> 00:27.419
Maybe I shouldn't go at all.

00:27.429 --> 00:28.637
Question,

00:29.097 --> 00:30.839
are you carrying a gun?

00:30.849 --> 00:32.025
If so,

00:32.034 --> 00:33.666
please shoot me in the head.

00:33.676 --> 00:36.155
Okay, you're right.
I'm dominating the conversation

00:36.179 --> 00:37.267
and the board.

00:37.291 --> 00:38.407
What's going on with you?

00:38.431 --> 00:40.075
Are you still failing out of Coast State?

00:40.099 --> 00:41.243
Try straight A's.

00:41.267 --> 00:43.852
The highest average in Dr. Orsi's class.

00:43.862 --> 00:45.247
She got me a night janitor job,

00:45.271 --> 00:48.106
<i>and</i> I get to use her lab after hours.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.942
I'm like a Syrian <i>Good Will Hunting.</i>

00:50.952 --> 00:53.371
Yeah, well, Syrian <i>Good Will Hunting</i>

00:53.395 --> 00:54.919
just lost his knight.

00:54.943 --> 00:56.091
Boom.

00:56.115 --> 00:58.000
How do you like them apples?

01:00.879 --> 01:02.202
Checkmate.

01:02.226 --> 01:03.672
I got to hit the road.

01:05.759 --> 01:08.678
Two and a half hours discussing
a wedding invitation.

01:08.961 --> 01:11.379
You are not the same guy
I met in Syria, my friend.

01:11.389 --> 01:12.974
Oh, yeah?

01:12.998 --> 01:15.007
Worse guy or better guy?

01:16.226 --> 01:18.061
Happier guy.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.091

- The full name is...
- Roger.

01:46.884 --> 01:48.259
I'm on it.

01:48.283 --> 01:51.230
Listen, your mother's not gonna
promote your head shop.

01:51.254 --> 01:53.308
Now, you take your sister
and go in another room.

01:56.017 --> 01:58.176
Uh, when's the official announcement?

01:58.186 --> 02:00.011
- Well, I hope to make it...
- It's the day after tomorrow.

02:00.021 --> 02:02.568
O-Outside the Criminal Courts Building.

02:02.592 --> 02:03.659
What is going on?

02:03.683 --> 02:05.276
It's so loud down here.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.254
I have to get to bed.
I have the SATs tomorrow.

02:07.278 --> 02:08.247
Roger.

02:08.270 --> 02:09.330
I'm on it.

02:09.354 --> 02:12.857
Riana, it is only 8:30.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.370
The tutor said
I need ten hours of sleep, Dad.

02:15.394 --> 02:16.863
- Ten hours.
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.523
Teenagers, you know?

02:19.547 --> 02:20.658
So I-I think

02:20.682 --> 02:22.177
- it is time we wrap it up.
- Yes.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.701
Daryl, do you think
you have everything you need?

02:23.711 --> 02:26.047
Yeah. Just about.
Uh, I would love some time

02:26.071 --> 02:27.748
with the candidate's spouse,

02:27.772 --> 02:29.268
just to fill out the profile.

02:29.292 --> 02:30.300
For an interview?

02:30.634 --> 02:32.354
Absolutely!

02:32.378 --> 02:34.597
I mean, if-if it'll help the profile.

02:34.607 --> 02:37.465
Hey, how 'bout a ride-along?

02:38.267 --> 02:40.070
Um, Roger,

02:40.094 --> 02:42.053
- can I see you for a minute?
- Sure.

02:44.315 --> 02:46.317
This is great. They want
to interview me, too.

02:46.341 --> 02:49.087
Yeah. But, honey, are you sure
you're okay with this,

02:49.111 --> 02:50.722
a reporter following you around?

02:50.746 --> 02:53.246
I'm fine. You know, cops get
this request all the time.

02:53.270 --> 02:56.052
And, I must say, I'm a
pretty compelling character.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.553
- Yes.
- You know what I mean.

02:57.577 --> 03:01.072
There's a lot going on, and I need
you to be focused on the home front.

03:01.082 --> 03:02.417
Just until I make my announcement.

03:02.441 --> 03:03.885
- Hey. Look at me.
- Mm.

03:03.909 --> 03:05.286
I'm laser-focused.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.872
Yeah, well, Riana,
she is anxious about her SATs.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.740
And I told her you would drive her there.

03:10.764 --> 03:11.765
Look at me.

03:11.789 --> 03:13.511
I will drive her there.

03:13.535 --> 03:15.063
You just worry about your campaign.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.015
I'll handle the rest of this.

03:17.039 --> 03:18.567
- Look at me.
- Hmm?

03:18.591 --> 03:20.008
I love you.

03:20.018 --> 03:21.570
I love you, too.

03:21.594 --> 03:23.011
Oh!

03:37.312 --> 03:38.366
Oh, my God.

03:38.390 --> 03:41.098
Dr. Orsi. No, no, no.

03:41.122 --> 03:44.041
Dr. Orsi. Please wake up, please.

03:44.459 --> 03:45.510
You.

03:45.534 --> 03:46.701
Don't move.

03:47.919 --> 03:50.273
- It wasn't me. I-I didn't...
- What happened here?

03:50.297 --> 03:51.609
- What... hey! You're coming with me.
- I didn't...

03:51.633 --> 03:53.268
No, I can't!

03:59.131 --> 04:00.975
Call 911.

04:00.999 --> 04:03.384
Third floor. Engineering.

04:07.606 --> 04:08.682
<i>Relax.</i>

04:08.691 --> 04:10.642

you want off the record,

04:10.652 --> 04:11.726
just remember to say "off the record."

04:11.736 --> 04:13.229
- Cool.
- Cool. All right.

04:13.239 --> 04:14.896
Let's start off
with a little bit of background.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.981
Who is Roger Murtaugh?

04:16.991 --> 04:19.327
Well, here's Roger Murtaugh in two words.

04:19.351 --> 04:21.221
A consummate partner.

04:21.245 --> 04:24.489
A partner at home, to our future D.A.,

04:24.499 --> 04:26.385
and a partner here at work,

04:26.409 --> 04:27.803
to this guy!

04:27.827 --> 04:29.054
Hey, partner!

04:29.078 --> 04:31.264
Hey, Roger. Who's your plus-one?

04:31.288 --> 04:34.416
Well, <i>L.A. Tribune</i> is
doing a story on me.

04:34.425 --> 04:36.167
- Uh, a story on Trish.
- And me.

04:36.177 --> 04:39.514
And I was explaining to him how partners

04:39.538 --> 04:41.400
let each other shine.

04:41.424 --> 04:44.592
They speak each other's
language, so to speak.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.344
Don't you agree?

04:46.561 --> 04:48.563
Cole. Do...

04:49.273 --> 04:50.515
He agrees.

04:50.525 --> 04:53.245
<i>Victim is</i> a Professor Janet Orsi.

04:53.269 --> 04:54.579
Mechanical engineering?

04:54.603 --> 04:56.354
Yeah. Cause of death,

04:56.364 --> 04:57.939
blunt force trauma.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.251
Weapon of choice,

04:59.275 --> 05:00.442
this here telephone.

05:00.451 --> 05:02.337
Campus cop spotted a suspect.

05:02.361 --> 05:03.922
Let me guess.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.197
Male. Had access

05:06.207 --> 05:07.528
to the lab.

05:07.552 --> 05:10.034
So, probably a student.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.128
Write that down.

05:12.463 --> 05:13.872
Rafi,

05:13.881 --> 05:14.933
where are you?

05:14.957 --> 05:16.708
Something happened at school.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.103
I know. I'm here now.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.105
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Let me help you.

05:20.129 --> 05:21.296
Okay? Just tell me where you are.

05:21.847 --> 05:23.306
Rafi.

05:24.559 --> 05:26.384
Considering

05:26.394 --> 05:28.530
the abandoned janitor's cart,

05:28.554 --> 05:30.138
I posit our perp is

05:30.148 --> 05:33.201
a 20-something on a work-study,

05:33.225 --> 05:35.977
maybe even in the engineering department.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.863
- Write that.
- Wrong on all counts.

05:38.397 --> 05:39.541
What? Excuse me.

05:39.565 --> 05:40.992
Our witness I.D. is unreliable.

05:41.016 --> 05:42.400
Footprints indicate

05:42.410 --> 05:45.130
orthotic shoes, so the suspect
is probably in his 50s.

05:45.154 --> 05:48.239
Clearly German descent.
And, uh, most likely a vagrant.

05:48.811 --> 05:51.001
Keep swinging for the fences.

05:54.497 --> 05:56.331
So, everything he just said,

05:56.340 --> 05:57.424
off the record.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.114
<i>Where's Murtaugh?</i>

06:08.124 --> 06:10.141
- I wanted to brief both of you.
- He's with this reporter.

06:10.165 --> 06:11.410
Why don't you brief me
and I'll brief him.

06:11.434 --> 06:13.356
Then it becomes a game of telephone.

06:14.350 --> 06:15.651
Prints came back.

06:17.152 --> 06:18.580
You think you have a suspect.

06:18.604 --> 06:20.438
- Look, I know he's a friend of yours.
- He's not our guy.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.284
But I can pick him up, get his story,

06:22.308 --> 06:23.669
and we can figure out
who we should be looking for.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.505
No. You and Murtaugh
are to stay away from this.

06:26.529 --> 06:28.530
- You're taking us off the case?
- Wasn't my decision.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.843
I got a call
from the D.A.'s office insisting

06:30.867 --> 06:32.450
that I assign any two other detectives.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.952
Who in the D.A.'s office called you?

06:33.962 --> 06:35.420
She's in the conference room.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.626
This case moved to the top of the pile,

06:41.636 --> 06:43.128
so get his photo wide and...

06:43.138 --> 06:44.971
You had me removed from the case?

06:45.889 --> 06:47.331
Cole, I know what you're going to say.

06:47.355 --> 06:48.725
He didn't do it.

06:52.231 --> 06:53.343
_

06:53.368 --> 06:54.973
Just let me explain.

06:54.983 --> 06:56.164
I know this kid.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.359
_

06:59.737 --> 07:01.530
Give us a minute.

07:03.615 --> 07:05.294
Those two are doing it, right?

07:05.318 --> 07:07.319
You <i>are</i> a detective.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.882
I understand you and Rafi are close.

07:09.906 --> 07:12.551
I know you feel responsible for
what happened to his brother.

07:12.575 --> 07:13.925
That has nothing to do with this.

07:13.935 --> 07:16.411
But it does.
This is a high-profile murder

07:16.421 --> 07:17.788
- in an election year.
- Meaning what?

07:17.798 --> 07:19.808
Meaning every protocol you ignore,

07:19.832 --> 07:23.612
every law you break on behalf
of your friend will get noticed.

07:23.636 --> 07:24.730
Trust me to do my job.

07:24.754 --> 07:26.671
I got a warrant to track Rafi's phone.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.315
Bailey and Gutierrez

07:28.339 --> 07:29.719
are on it.

07:29.729 --> 07:31.176
You guys are not.

07:31.186 --> 07:32.344
Are we clear?

07:32.353 --> 07:33.762
Yeah, yeah. Sounds good.

07:34.411 --> 07:36.408
What is this? Is this a bit?

07:36.432 --> 07:38.433
No, you make good points.
You convinced me.

07:38.443 --> 07:40.268
I trust you to do your job.

07:40.443 --> 07:41.830
You just got a text.

07:41.854 --> 07:43.104
What did it say?

07:43.488 --> 07:45.918
It was from Roger. He wants
to get something to eat.

07:45.942 --> 07:47.192
You are very suspicious.

07:47.202 --> 07:48.417
I dig that about you.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.204
- Mm-hmm.
- See you tonight.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.118
An engineering student on a work-study.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.537
You were right about all of it.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.767
Not a rare occurrence around here.

08:03.885 --> 08:07.462
So why were two other detectives
assigned to the case?

08:07.472 --> 08:09.798
Uh, Bailey and Gutierrez.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.633
Oh, no,

08:11.643 --> 08:15.637
that's me delegating
to a pair of up-and-comers

08:15.647 --> 08:19.618
to whom I'm sort of a father figure to.

08:19.983 --> 08:21.203
They're family.

08:21.227 --> 08:22.644
I would love to talk to them, too.

08:22.654 --> 08:24.328
Get their perspective on you and Trish.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.540
Yeah, sure.

08:25.564 --> 08:27.491
I'll make that happen.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.881
Excuse me.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.039
A father figure.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.221
Daryl Hill is a viper.

08:39.245 --> 08:40.745
I gave him an interview
during my campaign,

08:40.755 --> 08:42.224
and he sunk me.

08:42.248 --> 08:43.558
Before you sunk me.

08:43.582 --> 08:44.582
I'm good.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.834
This guy loves me.

08:45.843 --> 08:48.169
That's his move.
He showers you with compliments

08:48.179 --> 08:49.337
until you spill the secrets.

08:49.347 --> 08:50.755
Disembowels you.

08:50.765 --> 08:51.733
It's under control.

08:51.757 --> 08:53.392
I'm killin' it.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.176
You've been warned.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.679
Okay. Now, listen, I know

08:57.689 --> 08:59.347
that Cole is unhappy being off the case.

08:59.357 --> 09:01.516
I don't want to see him spiral

09:01.526 --> 09:02.767
over his friend from Syria.

09:02.777 --> 09:04.913
Cole is fine.

09:04.937 --> 09:06.248
There's no spiraling.

09:06.655 --> 09:08.240
Are you sure?

09:10.225 --> 09:12.277
I know my partner, Captain.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.674
Okay? I know him better
than I know myself.

09:19.368 --> 09:20.535
In fact,

09:20.545 --> 09:22.848
he just invited me to an early lunch.

09:22.872 --> 09:24.516
Fajitas.

09:24.540 --> 09:27.042
You see? No spiraling.

09:29.295 --> 09:31.273
<i>You should've told me about Rafi.</i>

09:31.297 --> 09:33.214
You didn't have to do
the whole smoke screen

09:33.224 --> 09:34.549
and throw me off the trail.

09:34.559 --> 09:36.145
The smoke screen wasn't for you.

09:36.154 --> 09:37.218
We're partners, Roger.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.947
You telling me you didn't
know what I was doing?

09:38.971 --> 09:40.755
Okay, yeah, maybe I did.

09:40.764 --> 09:41.950
Course you did.

09:41.974 --> 09:43.808
Just like you knew there's
no Mexican restaurant here.

09:43.818 --> 09:45.203
No?

09:45.227 --> 09:47.654
Yeah, yeah. I knew that.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.376
Wait a minute. Is that, uh...
Put those away.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.712
This is my friend Rafi.

09:53.736 --> 09:55.236
Rafi, this is Roger Murtaugh.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.654
Thank you for helping me.

09:57.288 --> 10:00.751
Can I talk to you
in the office here a second?

10:02.411 --> 10:05.330
Look, we're not on this case anymore.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.893
Gute and Bailey are looking
for this kid right now.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.144
I know. And they're tracking his phone,

10:09.168 --> 10:10.585
which means we have to go. Now.

10:10.595 --> 10:12.837
Murtaugh, you have to back my play.

10:12.847 --> 10:14.389
Rafi didn't do this.

10:21.097 --> 10:23.515
GPS says Rafi is right around the corner.

10:23.524 --> 10:25.243
Well, ladies,
to get back to Roger's quote

10:25.267 --> 10:27.352
- about being a father figure...
- Okay, wait.

10:27.362 --> 10:30.688
A father figure who's teaching
us the art of police work?

10:30.698 --> 10:31.917
No. Seriously?

10:31.941 --> 10:33.358
He e-mailed me the quote.

10:33.368 --> 10:34.836
Yeah, well, I got a
couple quotes for him,

10:34.860 --> 10:36.588
so...

10:36.612 --> 10:38.029
Rafi's on the move.

10:38.913 --> 10:42.010
Okay. Hang tight.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.907
The suspect is heading

10:57.917 --> 10:59.768
east on Mission. We're in pursuit.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.211
He's ahead of us. Turning right.

11:26.921 --> 11:29.724
LAPD. Pull over.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.059
That's it, I'm doing my move.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.561
Wait, what do you mean?
Just give him two seconds.

11:32.585 --> 11:35.512
No, no, no. He had his chance,
so hang tight. Here we go.

11:56.033 --> 11:58.326
Hands off the wheel.

12:02.413 --> 12:03.748
Not our guy.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.727
One phone. No suspect.

12:06.737 --> 12:08.453
All right, so where is he?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.456
<i>Let's get inside,
get you something to eat,</i>

12:11.466 --> 12:13.508
and you tell me the whole
thing from the beginning.

12:17.713 --> 12:19.881
Erica. What are you...?

12:19.891 --> 12:21.475
Sometimes I hate being right.

12:31.026 --> 12:33.486
You broke into my motel room.
You used me.

12:33.487 --> 12:37.106
No. There's a difference between
using you and knowing you.

12:37.116 --> 12:38.793
Cole, you harbored a fugitive.

12:38.817 --> 12:41.494
No. I was trying to protect my friend.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.272
Remember two hours ago,

12:46.296 --> 12:48.499
how I took you off a case
for your own good

12:48.523 --> 12:51.637
because I thought you would ignore
the law and protect this kid?

12:51.662 --> 12:53.106
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

12:53.131 --> 12:55.593
There's motive.
And there's physical evidence.

12:55.617 --> 12:56.713
What motive?

12:56.737 --> 13:00.204
Come on. A Syrian expat
on a student visa panics

13:00.214 --> 13:01.973
because he's failing out of college.

13:01.997 --> 13:03.308
Terrified of being deported.

13:03.332 --> 13:05.643
- Confronts his professor.
- But he's not failing.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.585
He's getting straight A's.
He told me yesterday.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.305
No.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.424
His transcript.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.935
Three F's and a "D." He lied to you.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.564
This can't be right.

13:20.849 --> 13:22.327
I would have known if he was lying.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.078
How?

13:25.613 --> 13:26.998
Same way that you knew

13:27.022 --> 13:29.292
that I'd be bringing him back
to that motel room.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.474
<i>So, you and Cole were protecting Rafi?</i>

13:32.921 --> 13:35.006
It's called backing your partner's play.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.364
In work,

13:37.258 --> 13:39.043
as in life, Daryl,

13:39.067 --> 13:42.597
the last thing you want to do is let down

13:42.621 --> 13:44.237
those who depend on you.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.459
Write that down. I-I have
some more thoughts on this.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.354
Hey.

13:49.378 --> 13:50.605
Dad, where are you?

13:50.629 --> 13:53.267
I'm supposed to be at the SATs
in 20 minutes.

13:53.277 --> 13:56.217
Right, SATs. Uh...

13:56.226 --> 13:58.719
Look, if you jump in the
car, you can make it.

13:58.729 --> 14:00.674
No, I can't drive myself.

14:00.684 --> 14:01.806
We discussed this.

14:01.815 --> 14:03.974
My tutor said I'm supposed to be calm

14:03.984 --> 14:06.120
and meditative before the test.

14:06.144 --> 14:07.694
Calm and meditative!

14:07.703 --> 14:09.563
Yes, yes, yes. What about an Uber?

14:09.573 --> 14:11.042
It's too late for an Uber!

14:11.066 --> 14:12.960
Okay, hey, everything's gonna be fine.

14:13.378 --> 14:14.702
Two words.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.596
Police escort.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.633
What?

14:18.657 --> 14:20.968
Yeah. There's a unit in the neighborhood.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.076
It could pick you up.

14:22.086 --> 14:23.430
Sirens. Flashers.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.246
Red light privileges.

14:26.270 --> 14:28.810
Okay, you're telling me you
want me to show up to the SATs

14:28.834 --> 14:30.978
in the back of a police car?!

14:31.002 --> 14:33.231
Oh, my God. I'm gonna fail.

14:33.255 --> 14:34.672
No. No, you're not.

14:34.682 --> 14:37.527
Remember what your dad always says.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.846
A test is but one test,

14:41.855 --> 14:46.363
whereas life is a series of tests.

14:46.373 --> 14:47.328
What?

14:47.352 --> 14:48.996
You never say that.
What does that even mean?

14:49.020 --> 14:50.415
I'm gonna vomit.

14:50.439 --> 14:52.208
Okay, I'm hanging up.

14:53.617 --> 14:56.444
Cop, husband, father.

14:56.453 --> 14:58.339
We're all just firemen

14:58.798 --> 15:00.958
putting out the flames

15:00.982 --> 15:03.678
wherever they may spark.

15:03.702 --> 15:06.120
Yeah, write that down.

15:06.681 --> 15:09.067
Hey, Jim. Can you help me out?

15:09.091 --> 15:10.791
- Why did you lie to me?
- I didn't.

15:10.801 --> 15:13.688
I got an "A" on the midterm,
A-minus on the final.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.463
- That's not what it says here.
- It's wrong.

15:15.472 --> 15:17.548
Someone changed my transcript.

15:17.558 --> 15:20.445
I swear on my brother's life.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.438
I'm not lying.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.324
Okay.

15:27.895 --> 15:28.870
Okay, so you were alone in the lab.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.227
You went to the restroom.

15:30.237 --> 15:32.229
Then you heard what?

15:32.915 --> 15:35.300
Dr. Orsi came in arguing with a guy.

15:35.324 --> 15:36.957
They were really yelling.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.379
- About what?
- She said

15:38.403 --> 15:39.581
he stole her research.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.322
Adhesion dynamics data.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.051
Aerospace stuff. So maybe
another engineering professor.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.744
That's a dead end. We talked to
everybody in the department directory.

15:46.754 --> 15:48.329
That's not everyone.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.516
There's got to be someone you missed.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.740
Rafi was right. We missed someone.

15:55.764 --> 15:57.815
Brian Li. A visiting professor
from Beijing

15:57.839 --> 15:59.484
with connections to
the Chinese government.

15:59.508 --> 16:00.735
Cole.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.167
As suspects go, this guy's a long shot.

16:03.177 --> 16:05.490
You know... you know
who's not a long shot?

16:05.514 --> 16:07.742
I trust Rafi. We have a history.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.136
Right, from your past life.

16:12.413 --> 16:14.271
The CIA. Syria.

16:14.281 --> 16:17.508
You know what? I'm just saying
not everyone from that life

16:17.518 --> 16:18.776
was an angel.

16:18.786 --> 16:20.838
I seem to remember
a certain mentor of yours

16:20.862 --> 16:23.915
who had you buried alive in the desert.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.154
_

16:28.073 --> 16:30.681
Rafi's a part of my past,
not a part of that life.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.340
He's not a killer.

16:52.254 --> 16:54.254
_

16:56.922 --> 16:58.244
Wesley Cole.

16:58.668 --> 17:00.668
_

17:00.816 --> 17:02.816
_

17:07.234 --> 17:09.076
- Hey, isn't that, uh...
- Professor Li!

17:09.086 --> 17:10.962
Stop! LAPD!

17:20.681 --> 17:21.922
It's an extraction.

17:21.932 --> 17:23.733
- What, like a tooth?
- No.

17:23.758 --> 17:25.810
MSS. Chinese intelligence.

17:26.321 --> 17:27.935
_

17:27.935 --> 17:29.935
_

17:36.697 --> 17:38.355
They're trying to slow us down.

17:38.365 --> 17:39.949
I saw this move in Shanghai.

17:42.703 --> 17:44.612
Couldn't it just be a power outage?

17:44.621 --> 17:46.414
It's Shanghai, 2010.

17:53.394 --> 17:55.394
_

17:55.575 --> 17:56.726
_

18:05.763 --> 18:06.861
_

18:07.030 --> 18:08.196
_

18:18.707 --> 18:19.798
_

18:30.992 --> 18:32.960
Roger. Roger, stop.

18:43.838 --> 18:46.933
I know. Shanghai, 2010.

18:52.445 --> 18:54.320
We're looking at a ten-day trial
minimum, so clear your...

18:54.345 --> 18:55.489
Professor Orsi's murder? It's part of

18:55.498 --> 18:57.373
- a human intelligence operation.
- Cole, I'm in the middle

18:57.398 --> 18:59.599
- of a staff meeting.
- Definitely a black bag job.

18:59.624 --> 19:01.354
Foreign nationals,
maybe a security agency.

19:01.354 --> 19:03.165
I am not clearing another room

19:03.189 --> 19:05.199
- for you, Detective.
- It's not Rafi.

19:07.171 --> 19:10.612
So, to be clear, you don't
have this Brian Li in custody,

19:10.622 --> 19:12.257
and you haven't spoken to Brian Li.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.176
Because he was exfiltrated
by a team of agents.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.201
Or he's just out to
lunch with his friends.

19:16.211 --> 19:17.930
- That's not what happened. I saw.
- I know.

19:17.954 --> 19:19.613
Secret agents who shut down power grids,

19:19.637 --> 19:22.040
mess with traffic lights,
alter transcripts.

19:22.050 --> 19:23.625
Don't you see what's happening here?

19:23.635 --> 19:25.043
Rafi is being set up.

19:25.053 --> 19:28.130
Right. Because everyone's
wrong except for you.

19:28.139 --> 19:30.966
My office, LAPD, the university.

19:30.975 --> 19:33.278
- You have zero evidence.
- That's why I need you

19:33.302 --> 19:36.367
- to slow things down for me.
- Oh, oh, you need me to?

19:37.065 --> 19:39.618
His arraignment is set for tomorrow.

19:39.642 --> 19:41.036
What do you want me to do?

19:41.060 --> 19:43.036
Walk into the courthouse
and steal the paperwork?

19:43.046 --> 19:44.396
Yes. Do that.

19:44.406 --> 19:45.564
Or get me access,

19:45.573 --> 19:47.816
- alarm codes so I can...
- Cole, stop.

19:47.826 --> 19:51.820
You can't barge into my office
and ask me to defy my boss,

19:51.830 --> 19:53.238
break the law

19:53.248 --> 19:56.908
and end a career
I've spent 15 years building.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.406
You're talking to a D.A.

20:01.329 --> 20:03.298
Thought I was talking to a friend.

20:03.728 --> 20:05.333
I don't know what kind of relationships

20:05.343 --> 20:06.751
you've had in the past,

20:06.761 --> 20:08.920
but if this is how you treat people...

20:08.930 --> 20:11.150
You know, Natalie wouldn't think
twice about breaking the law for me,

20:11.174 --> 20:12.695
and we're not even together.

20:13.792 --> 20:14.822
Well...

20:15.344 --> 20:17.491
maybe it's <i>why you're not together.</i>

20:28.941 --> 20:31.860
Hey. Uh, Dad said set up
the table before Mom gets home,

20:31.870 --> 20:34.029
- so help out, would you?
- No, you got it.

20:34.038 --> 20:36.091
I, uh, had a long day. SATs.

20:36.115 --> 20:39.126
Right, yeah. How were the SATs?

20:40.306 --> 20:43.038
A battle, but I persevered.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.289
Really?

20:44.299 --> 20:46.268
Persevered pretty quickly
considering I saw you

20:46.292 --> 20:48.854
on Ventura drinking coffee
20 minutes after

20:48.878 --> 20:50.948
- the SATs started.
- Oh, my God. Yes.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.131
I walked out of the SATs.
And I'll help you set the table,

20:53.141 --> 20:55.583
- but please don't tell Mom and Dad.
- It's gonna be okay.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.779
I had a panic attack,

20:57.803 --> 20:59.888
and I just couldn't be in that room,

20:59.898 --> 21:01.723
and now my future's down the toilet,

21:01.733 --> 21:03.141
and I'm through. I'm done.

21:03.151 --> 21:04.786
No. No, you're not.

21:04.810 --> 21:06.923
Listen, take it from someone

21:06.947 --> 21:11.076
who's flaked on every commitment
he's ever had, okay?

21:11.100 --> 21:12.377
It's gonna be okay.

21:12.891 --> 21:15.153
Um, how do I tell Mom and Dad?

21:15.163 --> 21:16.905
Clearly and simply. "Mom, Dad,

21:16.915 --> 21:19.051
I skipped the SATs." Now you try it.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.410
Mom, Dad...

21:22.420 --> 21:24.087
"I skipped the SATs"?

21:26.227 --> 21:27.749
Perfect. Great plan, RJ.

21:27.759 --> 21:29.000
I got it. I got it. Uh, Pops,

21:29.010 --> 21:31.002
um, standardized testing
doesn't really measure

21:31.012 --> 21:33.004
- your, uh, your intelligence.
- Shut up. Sit down.

21:33.014 --> 21:35.234
I'm talking to your sister.

21:35.778 --> 21:37.008
What happened, Riana?

21:37.018 --> 21:39.094
I got you a police escort and everything.

21:39.103 --> 21:41.740
No, but I wanted you
to drive me, not a stranger

21:41.764 --> 21:43.784
with a gun and a siren!

21:43.808 --> 21:45.185
It was so loud, Dad.

21:45.195 --> 21:47.319
So loud.

21:49.605 --> 21:51.416
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.753
When your mother comes home,
not a word about this.

21:54.777 --> 21:56.695
Okay? We're gonna be all smiles...

21:57.341 --> 21:58.446
and zip it.

21:59.176 --> 22:00.970
Let's see those smiles.

22:04.849 --> 22:06.454
Hey...

22:06.464 --> 22:08.767
There she is.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.435
The candidate.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.271
A police escort...

22:12.295 --> 22:13.545
to the SATs?

22:14.191 --> 22:15.462
Who's the rat?

22:15.472 --> 22:17.025
The <i>L.A. Tribun</i> Roger. It went online

22:17.049 --> 22:18.883
- 30 minutes ago.
- It's online that

22:18.893 --> 22:21.171
I went to the SATs in a police car?

22:21.195 --> 22:25.200
"In a single day, the husband
of would-be D.A. Trish Murtaugh

22:25.224 --> 22:26.975
"led his LAPD department

22:26.985 --> 22:29.955
on a high-speed chase,
aided a fugitive and..."

22:29.979 --> 22:32.457
"...and sent a police cruiser
on a personal errand

22:32.481 --> 22:34.626
for his daughter."

22:34.650 --> 22:36.128
Oh, my God.

22:36.152 --> 22:39.237
I am going upstairs, and
I'll see you all in ten years.

22:39.247 --> 22:41.994
48 hours, Roger.

22:42.018 --> 22:45.410
All I wanted was 48 hours
to focus on my campaign.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.579
Right, but...

22:46.603 --> 22:49.923
48... hours.

22:58.486 --> 23:00.759
I forgot to say "off the record."

23:00.768 --> 23:02.615
Should've said it.

23:07.703 --> 23:09.267
Is this about the poultry truck?

23:09.277 --> 23:11.413
That doesn't sound like
an apology... but no.

23:11.437 --> 23:12.771
It's about Cole.

23:12.780 --> 23:13.938
He just called and asked me

23:13.948 --> 23:15.607
to help him break into a courthouse.

23:15.617 --> 23:17.085
Is that slang for something else?

23:17.109 --> 23:19.694
I wish. He asked me to do the same thing.

23:19.704 --> 23:21.089
But I didn't return the call.

23:21.113 --> 23:22.758
Well, if he's going
in alphabetical order,

23:22.782 --> 23:23.948
that means Scorsese is next,

23:23.958 --> 23:25.427
and you know he'll say yes.

23:25.451 --> 23:26.678
I'm not worried about Scorsese.

23:26.702 --> 23:29.052
You're not? Then who?

23:29.062 --> 23:31.922
One of those crazy lunatics
from his past, maybe? Barnes?

23:32.728 --> 23:35.607
Not really. I mean,
after what that guy did to him?

23:35.631 --> 23:36.876
Cole would never.

23:36.900 --> 23:39.139
Are you asking me, or are you telling me?

24:00.089 --> 24:01.958
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

24:01.968 --> 24:03.547
- I didn't think you'd show.
- Why?

24:03.556 --> 24:06.741
Because you threatened to kill
me last time we talked? Come on.

24:07.221 --> 24:08.743
That's how I know you care.

24:09.399 --> 24:10.524
You've looked better.

24:10.548 --> 24:11.798
You sleeping?

24:12.142 --> 24:13.193
I'm stuck.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.470
I wouldn't have called
if I had any other options.

24:15.494 --> 24:16.689
I know.

24:19.065 --> 24:23.335
So, Rafi Rahal...
I remember that was a hard deal

24:23.359 --> 24:24.454
with his kid brother.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.896
He had a good head on his shoulders.

24:26.906 --> 24:28.291
He still does.

24:28.315 --> 24:30.483
Like I said, I just need information.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.453
I think he may be caught
in the middle of something.

24:35.692 --> 24:37.249
You're not wrong.

24:39.461 --> 24:42.389
Brian Li has been recruited
by Chinese intelligence.

24:42.413 --> 24:45.976
The MSS commissioned him with
stealing aerospace technology.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.794
He got caught in the act.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.919
So the MSS is cleaning up his mess

24:49.929 --> 24:51.181
and pinning it on Rafi.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.174
Once they get him to Beijing,
Rafi's toast.

24:54.183 --> 24:55.485
That's correct.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.344
I know where he is.
I know when he's leaving.

24:58.354 --> 25:02.015
Question is: do you
want more than information?

25:02.651 --> 25:04.267
Because you know me...

25:04.277 --> 25:06.830
I'm willing to help any way I can.

25:06.854 --> 25:08.741
It's your call.

25:17.373 --> 25:20.125
Hey. Big announcement day.

25:22.463 --> 25:24.715
That's a bold wardrobe choice.

25:25.966 --> 25:28.101
I'm calling the whole thing off.
The campaign?

25:28.125 --> 25:29.436
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.461
Look, baby, I know I dropped the ball...

25:31.471 --> 25:33.690
No, Roger, it's not your fault.

25:33.714 --> 25:35.965
I asked you to take on too much.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.394
You see?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.946
Just you saying that let's me know

25:39.970 --> 25:43.700
that you would be the best D.A.
this city has ever seen.

25:43.724 --> 25:46.976
Hmm. How can I enforce the law

25:46.986 --> 25:49.529
when my husband ignores it?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.148
You believe that?

25:52.785 --> 25:53.853
No.

25:54.370 --> 25:56.203
It was a line in the article.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.405
It's too much, Roger.

25:59.415 --> 26:02.408
And I've come to terms with
what we can and cannot handle.

26:02.418 --> 26:04.077
And this family?

26:04.087 --> 26:05.464
A campaign?

26:06.924 --> 26:09.499
That's something that
we're not built for.

26:10.052 --> 26:12.145
Another line in the article?

26:12.169 --> 26:13.396
Nope.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.639
That's all me.

26:25.015 --> 26:26.030
For you.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.777
I'm on an apology... tour.

26:30.614 --> 26:32.021
Sorry I didn't call you back

26:32.031 --> 26:33.690
about breaking into the courthouse.

26:33.699 --> 26:35.694
It wouldn't have helped, anyway.

26:35.718 --> 26:36.701
It was a bad plan.

26:38.038 --> 26:40.340
Look, I know how much
you care about Rafi,

26:40.364 --> 26:43.116
- and I'll do anything to help.
- I appreciate it.

26:43.126 --> 26:44.294
See you at work.

26:47.089 --> 26:48.547
Uh, thanks for the coffee?

26:52.051 --> 26:53.186
CIA?

26:53.210 --> 26:55.128
You went to Barnes?

26:55.597 --> 26:57.213
I'm going down every road there is.

26:57.725 --> 26:59.048
My friend's life is in danger.

26:59.058 --> 27:01.960
Oh, great plan. You keep
working with this guy,

27:01.970 --> 27:03.730
and your life is gonna be in danger, too.

27:03.754 --> 27:04.948
I'm not working with him.

27:04.972 --> 27:07.307
I just went to him
for information, that's all.

27:07.316 --> 27:09.944
Brian Li? Confirmed Chinese asset.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.478
So, does Barnes know where he is now?

27:13.032 --> 27:15.148
No. Probably halfway to Beijing.

27:15.158 --> 27:18.067
- Okay, so, then, what are we gonna do?
- Well, what I'm gonna do

27:18.077 --> 27:21.070
is hit up every airport...
LAX, John Wayne...

27:21.080 --> 27:22.655
convince a TSA agent to give me access

27:22.665 --> 27:25.218
- to their restricted databases.
- Now, how are you gonna do that?

27:25.242 --> 27:26.757
Bribes, threats, intimidation.

27:27.171 --> 27:28.589
You're welcome to come along.

27:29.246 --> 27:31.657
Look, Cole, this is not just illegal...

27:31.681 --> 27:33.499
So when you said
you'd do anything to help,

27:33.509 --> 27:35.084
you didn't really mean <i>anything.</i>

27:35.471 --> 27:36.722
Did you?

27:37.096 --> 27:38.722
Close the door on your way out, Roger.

27:48.050 --> 27:49.374
<i>Captain, Cole's theory</i>

27:49.398 --> 27:51.346
<i>about the Coast State murder
might be dead-on.</i>

27:51.371 --> 27:53.622
A ton of files from
Professor Orsi's hard drive

27:53.632 --> 27:56.602
were transferred to a server
owned by the Chinese government.

27:56.867 --> 27:58.791
- That's tenuous.
- And a surveillance van

27:58.815 --> 28:00.879
that our guys were chasing is registered

28:00.889 --> 28:02.390
to the Chinese consulate.

28:03.588 --> 28:04.829
Less tenuous.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.946
Look, if Li's in town,
I bet that's where he is.

28:06.970 --> 28:09.305
The consulate's foreign soil...
we don't have jurisdiction.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.889
I know... which means
someone's gonna have to walk

28:10.899 --> 28:12.641
into our friend the D.A.'s office

28:12.651 --> 28:15.037
with a big smile on their face
and request extradition.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.946
- Not me.
- Not me.

28:18.639 --> 28:20.876
You want a letter
requesting an extradition?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.379
It doesn't have to be a
long letter... a paragraph.

28:23.403 --> 28:25.654
To whom it may concern.
End with "best wishes."

28:25.664 --> 28:28.657
There is no evidence
Brian Li killed Orsi.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.086
There is even less evidence
he's in the consulate.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.911
That's why the letter
doesn't have to be long.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.308
And even if he was,

28:35.332 --> 28:38.394
there is no way in hell
they'd hand him over.

28:38.418 --> 28:40.730
Well... Rafi's going to court
tomorrow... it's a Hail Mary.

28:40.754 --> 28:42.045
What's the downside?

28:42.070 --> 28:44.817
Murtaugh and Cole are
radioactive around here.

28:45.297 --> 28:48.260
If I do this, any nonsense
falls right on me.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.012
There will be no "pulling a Cole."

28:50.022 --> 28:51.764
Zero nonsense. I can guarantee it.

28:52.089 --> 28:53.576
Murtaugh's going by himself.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.067
Cole won't even know about it.

28:56.445 --> 28:58.020
What <i>is</i> going on with Cole?

28:58.030 --> 29:00.522
Feels like he's headed off a cliff.

29:00.532 --> 29:01.607
He's fighting for a friend.

29:01.617 --> 29:03.669
Even though it may not seem like it,

29:03.693 --> 29:04.910
it's one of his better qualities.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.044
All right, quick review.

29:12.068 --> 29:13.679
It's a simple extraction.

29:13.703 --> 29:15.704
Well, you keep telling yourself that.

29:15.714 --> 29:17.016
Now, on the perimeter,

29:17.040 --> 29:19.602
a high-voltage electrified fence.

29:19.626 --> 29:20.936
So just like Kabul.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.521
Higher voltage.

29:22.545 --> 29:23.606
Think Bogotá.

29:23.630 --> 29:24.713
15,000 watts

29:24.723 --> 29:26.632
with a recharge gap of ten seconds.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.384
I do like a challenge.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.696
Yeah, well, there's
armed security teams outside

29:30.720 --> 29:32.471
and on every floor.

29:32.921 --> 29:35.391
You want to go over the exit strategy?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.726
Nope. It's all up here.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.029
Put me in, coach. I'm ready.

29:40.814 --> 29:42.898
Just like old times.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:51.825 --> 29:53.290
So the fence is still on.

29:53.314 --> 29:54.919
Yeah, good thing you checked.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.583
Okay, on my signal,

30:01.593 --> 30:02.895
you'll have ten seconds.

30:03.721 --> 30:05.421
Power's off in...

30:05.430 --> 30:06.755
three,

30:06.765 --> 30:08.146
two,

30:08.170 --> 30:10.569
one. Ten,

30:10.593 --> 30:14.096
nine, eight, seven,

30:14.106 --> 30:16.515
six, five,

30:16.525 --> 30:19.412
four, three,

30:19.436 --> 30:21.470
two, one.

30:22.781 --> 30:23.916
I'm through.

30:23.940 --> 30:25.357
That was the easy part.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.420
Your feedback used to be more positive.

30:28.695 --> 30:30.840
Security team's on the east corner.

30:30.864 --> 30:32.448
Don't get killed.

30:32.457 --> 30:33.607
Better?

31:09.828 --> 31:11.487
Ah.

31:11.496 --> 31:12.882
He's back.

31:12.906 --> 31:14.740
I recognize you, friend.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.233
From the university.

31:17.484 --> 31:18.911
I have that kind of face.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.463
Who sent you here?

31:21.655 --> 31:22.915
Is that for me?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.477
That's so thoughtful.

31:24.501 --> 31:25.909
Do you have anything in sparkling?

31:39.941 --> 31:42.351
It's an extradition request.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.747
It's really not that long of a letter.

31:44.771 --> 31:46.916
I can summarize for you.

31:46.940 --> 31:51.504
LAPD is asking you to hand
over Mr. Brian Li to us.

31:51.528 --> 31:52.671
I'm sorry.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.623
- We can't help you.
- Huh.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.782
I brought you a fruit basket.
You like fruit?

31:56.792 --> 31:58.033
Come on.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.943
Help a brother out.

32:09.712 --> 32:11.713
My friend...

32:11.723 --> 32:13.859
you are in a foreign country.

32:13.883 --> 32:16.051
We can keep you here as long as we like.

32:16.061 --> 32:19.388
No one... is coming for you.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.033
That's not true.

32:21.057 --> 32:22.733
I ordered some soup.

32:30.567 --> 32:31.961
Detective Murtaugh.

32:31.985 --> 32:35.581
My apologies, but we have
no record of this man's visit.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.498
Professor Li isn't with us.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.803
I never said he was a professor.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.078
Your request is denied.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.673
Well, I'll just wait
until it isn't denied.

32:50.086 --> 32:51.920
Cole, I'm buying you three seconds.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.399
Better act fast.

32:53.423 --> 32:56.758
One more time. Who are you working for?

32:56.768 --> 32:58.070
LAPD...

32:58.094 --> 32:59.770
or CIA?

33:01.439 --> 33:02.908
That...

33:03.178 --> 33:05.355
is a very good question.

33:29.551 --> 33:30.959
What took you so long?

33:30.969 --> 33:33.629
To be honest, I wanted
to hear you answer the question.

33:33.638 --> 33:36.025
LAPD or CIA?

33:53.312 --> 33:55.280
Head to the northwest corner.

33:55.305 --> 33:58.349
The guest quarters should be
behind the door on the right.

33:59.822 --> 34:00.966
Your right or my right?

34:01.356 --> 34:02.908
Eeny,

34:02.918 --> 34:05.661
meeny, miny...

34:05.670 --> 34:07.412
Moe.

34:07.422 --> 34:10.132
Professor Li.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.568
_

34:11.592 --> 34:14.146
You're gonna miss that flight.

34:14.170 --> 34:16.679
Head straight, get to the tunnel.

34:32.855 --> 34:35.440
Tunnel entrance is on the left.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.576
Got it. We'll see you outside.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.441
_

35:16.408 --> 35:17.616
Brian Li!

35:20.486 --> 35:22.464
Move, kid. LAPD's on their way.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.905
They're already here.

35:23.915 --> 35:25.499
Who's in your ear?

35:26.418 --> 35:27.409
Barnes?

35:27.419 --> 35:28.804
You wouldn't help me, Roger.

35:28.828 --> 35:29.911
I'm here, aren't I?

35:29.921 --> 35:31.663
What was your plan?

35:31.673 --> 35:33.248
Abduct a Chinese national?

35:33.258 --> 35:34.560
They'll just send him home

35:34.584 --> 35:37.730
and lock you up,
and how is that gonna help Rafi?

35:38.243 --> 35:40.338
- You're doing the same thing.
- No.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.841
I did it without throwing away
the rulebook,

35:42.851 --> 35:45.070
without lying to my partner,

35:45.094 --> 35:46.928
and you're a really good liar.

35:46.938 --> 35:48.564
I had no idea.

35:52.610 --> 35:53.829
Roger.

35:53.853 --> 35:55.446
I don't want to hear it.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.522
Cole?

36:09.702 --> 36:12.037
Your extradition has been requested.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.674
I have a letter.

36:21.563 --> 36:22.971
Rafi?

36:24.040 --> 36:26.278
I wanted to offer an apology

36:26.302 --> 36:29.221
on behalf of the D.A. and myself.

36:29.838 --> 36:31.867
Thank you. You were doing your job.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.536
The way it looked, you'd have
had to be crazy to believe me.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.537
He's right.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.122
Certifiable.

36:37.146 --> 36:38.169
See you Monday.

36:44.144 --> 36:46.055
Paperwork got a bit complicated.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.323
Brian Li, after confessing to murder,

36:48.333 --> 36:51.409
claimed a crazy white guy
abducted him from the consulate.

36:51.419 --> 36:54.640
Oh. I bet he hallucinated it.

36:54.664 --> 36:57.082
I hear it's very stressful
being a fugitive.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.478
I've heard that, too.

36:59.502 --> 37:01.269
That's why I kept it out of my report.

37:01.279 --> 37:03.398
My... official,

37:03.422 --> 37:05.507
legally-binding report

37:05.517 --> 37:07.069
with my signature on it.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.729
I know I shouldn't have asked
what I asked of you. I'm sorry.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.608
Don't be. It's who you are.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.500
My key.

37:21.524 --> 37:23.575
Is this because
I asked for it back, or...?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.354
Is this you saying it's over?

37:28.021 --> 37:30.854
I'm happy you were right
about Rafi, and I was wrong.

37:31.338 --> 37:32.761
The thing is,

37:32.785 --> 37:36.849
if it happened again,
I would do it all the same,

37:37.197 --> 37:38.540
except I wouldn't lie for you.

37:39.616 --> 37:40.792
It's who you are.

37:43.972 --> 37:45.547
I blew it, didn't I?

37:48.301 --> 37:49.709
When I was in your room,

37:51.336 --> 37:53.699
I saw the invitation
to Natalie's wedding.

37:54.339 --> 37:55.507
Yeah.

37:56.966 --> 37:59.227
I was gonna ask you to be my date.

38:00.053 --> 38:01.396
I don't think I'm going.

38:02.097 --> 38:04.224
A girl that'd break the law for you.

38:05.308 --> 38:06.712
Maybe you should.

38:06.736 --> 38:09.214
♪ It could be

38:09.238 --> 38:11.874
♪ Forever you and me

38:14.752 --> 38:19.308
♪ My memories remain here

38:19.332 --> 38:22.918
♪ They'll just stay ingrained

38:27.288 --> 38:28.915
I think that one's clean.

38:29.791 --> 38:31.009
Can I help?

38:33.438 --> 38:35.597
I used to think of myself as a guy

38:35.607 --> 38:37.993
who knows his partner.

38:38.017 --> 38:40.245
Kind of like an expert.

38:40.269 --> 38:42.497
Honey, it's a two-way street.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.917
A partner has to let themselves be known.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.910
You're right. They do.

38:48.945 --> 38:50.779
Take you, for example.

38:50.788 --> 38:52.781
Oh.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.617
Is this the part you tell me
you're an expert in me?

38:55.627 --> 38:59.287
After 22 years, I believe I am.

38:59.845 --> 39:00.942
I think I know why

39:00.951 --> 39:03.095
you changed your mind
about running for D.A.

39:03.867 --> 39:05.710
I told you. I took my
hands off the wheel,

39:05.720 --> 39:07.565
cost Riana the SATs...

39:07.589 --> 39:09.122
Is it possible...

39:10.391 --> 39:13.051
that this has nothing to do with the kids

39:13.061 --> 39:14.627
or me messing up?

39:15.313 --> 39:17.449
I mean, D.A.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.785
That's a big damn job.

39:19.809 --> 39:21.954
♪ Whoa

39:21.978 --> 39:23.872
♪ Every night

39:23.896 --> 39:25.374
Does it scare you?

39:25.398 --> 39:26.648

♪ Lord, I need it...

39:28.660 --> 39:31.981
This started with me
saying "yes" one time.

39:32.562 --> 39:36.241
And now this train is out of my control.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.660
What if it's too much for us?

39:39.152 --> 39:41.890
You say the family's not built for this?

39:42.739 --> 39:44.075
Maybe not,

39:44.698 --> 39:46.267
but I'm telling you, you are.

39:47.202 --> 39:50.839
And we will just build ourselves
into the family that you need.

39:53.263 --> 39:54.426
22 years later.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.456
I learned a thing or two.

39:57.879 --> 39:59.408
You learned more than a thing or two.

39:59.432 --> 40:01.076
- I'm very impressed, baby.
- Yeah?

40:01.100 --> 40:03.819
Yes.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.297
<i>I want to thank you again.</i>

40:08.307 --> 40:10.168
You really came through for Rafi.

40:11.059 --> 40:12.828
I did that for you, pal.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.130
I've asked you before.

40:23.085 --> 40:24.604
Are you holding up okay?

40:24.613 --> 40:26.958
I mean, uh, starting
a whole new life of your own...

40:26.968 --> 40:29.011
that's not easy.

40:30.453 --> 40:31.773
I had one, didn't I?

40:33.039 --> 40:35.976
A whole life... before this.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.340
It's still there, waiting for you.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.214
I've known you forever, kid.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.680
I've seen you at your best,
at your worst.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.307
And for what it's worth,

40:52.433 --> 40:54.811
you were at the top of your game tonight.

40:58.273 --> 40:59.624
It was fun, wasn't it?

40:59.648 --> 41:01.041
Yeah.

41:01.051 --> 41:03.013
It always is.

41:04.232 --> 41:07.011
You want to do it again,
you give me a call.

41:08.202 --> 41:09.970
Any time, Cole.

41:20.101 --> 41:21.599
<i>Okay, all I'm saying is</i>

41:21.623 --> 41:23.290
that those courthouse steps
are still available

41:23.300 --> 41:24.435
tomorrow morning with...

41:24.459 --> 41:26.353
Nope. Right here, right now.

41:26.377 --> 41:27.905
Okay, you're the boss.

41:27.929 --> 41:29.638
- Leave my hair alone.
- Backing off.

41:30.896 --> 41:32.229
Your mom is tough.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.732
Yeah, do not mess with that woman. Okay.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.793
Set?

41:35.817 --> 41:37.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Action.

41:37.402 --> 41:39.904
Hi. I am Trish Murtaugh,

41:39.913 --> 41:41.299
and I am running for district...

41:42.824 --> 41:44.408
RJ, is that your phone?

41:44.418 --> 41:46.043
Nah, it's yours.

41:48.922 --> 41:51.332
That family we're building...
it's a work in progress.

41:51.341 --> 41:53.250
Excuse me.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.419
It's okay.

41:57.756 --> 41:59.650
Well, what's on your mind?

41:59.674 --> 42:00.985
You got a minute to talk?

42:01.009 --> 42:03.070
I want to thank you
for what you did today

42:03.838 --> 42:05.740
and... what you didn't do.

42:06.174 --> 42:08.015
Keeping my name out of it.

42:08.301 --> 42:10.077
And I'm sorry for bailing on you,

42:10.595 --> 42:12.102
going on my own to get this guy.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.271
Except you weren't on your own.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.000
You want to talk?

42:16.024 --> 42:18.753
Let's talk about how
you looked me right in my eye

42:18.777 --> 42:20.277
and then lied to my face,

42:20.287 --> 42:22.089
and then, how you sold it.

42:22.113 --> 42:23.614
It was unforgivable, Roger.

42:24.190 --> 42:25.909
It'll never happen again.

42:25.944 --> 42:29.397
I walked into that consulate
not knowing the score.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.955
You lied to me and I believed you,

42:30.964 --> 42:32.706
and it almost got me killed.

42:33.951 --> 42:36.020
Cole, I put my life in your hands

42:36.044 --> 42:37.962
every time I walk out my door.

42:37.971 --> 42:40.274
How am I supposed to do that now?

42:41.376 --> 42:43.717
Let me come by tonight,
talk to you face-to-face.

42:44.087 --> 42:45.135
Not tonight.

42:45.755 --> 42:48.138
- I'm all talked out.
- ...the best district attorney...

42:48.148 --> 42:50.483
And besides, my family is waiting on me.

42:53.697 --> 42:54.789
And, hey, Cole,

42:55.390 --> 42:57.064
you were right about today.

42:57.617 --> 43:00.368
What you did was unforgivable.
