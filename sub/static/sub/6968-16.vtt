00:02.044 --> 00:05.756
I have lived with a fragile faith
built on vague memories...

00:05.839 --> 00:10.344
...from an experience that I could
neither prove nor explain.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.388
When I was 12, my sister was taken from me.

00:13.472 --> 00:18.644
Taken from our home by a force
that I came to believe was extraterrestrial.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.812
This belief sustained me...

00:20.896 --> 00:25.192
...fuelling a quest for truths
that were as elusive as the memory itself.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.320
To believe so passionately
was not without sacrifice...

00:28.403 --> 00:30.531
...but I always accepted the risks -

00:30.614 --> 00:35.494
...to my career, my reputation,
my relationships, to life itself.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.265
Easy.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.477
He's an FBI agent. His name's Mulder.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.153
Come on, let's go!

01:11.405 --> 01:13.532
Get a frostbite bay, stat!

01:14.658 --> 01:16.952
Let's get ready, please!

01:24.251 --> 01:28.839
- Basal temp's 86ยบ.
- Right eye dilated. Left eye dilated.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.092
All right, let's get him into that tub
or we'll lose him.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.469
On three. One, two, three.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.768
- Agent Mulder was brought here tonight.
- This is an authorised area.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.938
- I'm a federal agent.
- Hold on! We need to see some ID.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.733
There is no time for this. A man is dying.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.613
What happened to me out on the ice
has justified every belief.

01:52.696 --> 01:56.992
If I should die now, it will be with a certainty
that my faith has been righteous.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.286
And if larger mysteries are revealed...

01:59.369 --> 02:03.540
...I will already know the answer
to the question that has driven me here.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.169
That there is intelligent life
in the universe other than our own.

02:07.252 --> 02:11.089
That they are here among us.
And that they have begun to colonise.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.474
I'm Dana Scully, his partner.
What are his vitals?

02:20.557 --> 02:24.228
- He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.
- No! Get him out of the tub.

02:24.311 --> 02:28.232
- He's lost all his body heat.
- If you keep him in there, you'll kill him.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.651
The cold is what's keeping him alive.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.569
His heart stopped!

02:32.653 --> 02:35.864
Get me one amp of epinephrine
and a cannula.

Episode 16 - Colony

03:31.962 --> 03:37.426
You gotta see this, Cap. We got a UFO
or something buzzing us. Right up here.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.601
It's been up there for about 20 minutes.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.854
- Could be a helicopter.
- Not the way it flew over us.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.023
It's coming at us again.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.568
It's gonna crash.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.908
Reverse engine!

04:01.867 --> 04:03.452
We're going after it.

04:12.794 --> 04:17.507
Two days ago, the crew of an ice cutter
thought they had seen a UFO...

04:17.591 --> 04:20.636
...when a strange aircraft
plunged into the Beaufort Sea.

04:20.677 --> 04:25.182
Later they recovered what is believed to be
a Russian fighter pilot from the water...

04:25.224 --> 04:29.228
...where he miraculously survived
the extreme Arctic temperatures.

04:29.353 --> 04:33.941
The man was airlifted to a hospital in Alaska,
where he was listed in stable condition.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.653
But while authorities have been
trying to determine who he is...

04:37.694 --> 04:42.366
...we've learned that he has walked out of
the hospital and is now listed as missing.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.701
Reporting from our field office...

04:54.670 --> 04:58.257
- Where is he?
- Agh! I don't know.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.175
- I've been looking for you.
- I was down the street.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.969
Someone fired more shots
at the White House.

05:44.011 --> 05:49.266
You gotta wonder when even the president
has to worry about drive-by shootings.

05:49.308 --> 05:53.478
- What are you working on?
- I found these in my e-mail. Three obituaries.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.147
Sent by whom?

05:55.189 --> 05:58.609
- Obviously somebody that knows me.
- Why?

05:58.650 --> 06:02.905
The deceased are Dr Landon Prince
of Scranton, Pennsylvania...

06:02.988 --> 06:05.782
...Dr Dale Gayhart of New York City...

06:05.908 --> 06:08.744
...and Dr Harvey Buchanon
of Tea Neck, New Jersey.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.914
All worked in abortion clinics.
They died in arson fires.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.334
- Sounds like militant right-to-lifers.
- Sounds like it.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.463
- Why send them to you?
- It's taken me all morning to figure that out.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.507
What'd you find?

06:21.632 --> 06:25.636
This is the latest victim - Dr Landon Prince.

06:25.677 --> 06:30.098
And these are the other two victims.
Drs Gayhart... and Buchanon.

06:33.936 --> 06:37.314
- Triplets?
- Nope. I can't find any blood connection.

06:37.689 --> 06:43.111
In fact, I can't find any records on them at all.
It's as if, before they died, they never existed.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.072
What?

06:45.656 --> 06:48.951
Dr Prince performed
legal clinical abortions...

06:48.992 --> 06:52.329
...which has its own
occupational hazards these days.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.248
You don't know any more about him?

06:54.373 --> 06:57.417
He went about his work quietly.
No family's come forward.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.212
What about the man you arrested?
This preacher?

07:00.254 --> 07:05.259
Reverend Calvin Sistrunk. He's got a motive.
He's threatened these abortion docs before.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.262
He was carrying this when we arrested him.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.391
We're hoping for an indictment.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.519
As soon as you locate Dr Prince's remains.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.856
Yes. But that fact hasn't been released.

07:18.981 --> 07:22.818
There have been two identical fire deaths.
Neither body's been found.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.864
We're certain he was in the building.
His car was in the parking lot.

07:26.989 --> 07:32.327
We found his keys where the fire was started.
He's been missing since the incident.

07:32.411 --> 07:35.831
Could be we'll just be finding teeth and bone.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.001
Good afternoon!

07:39.126 --> 07:44.256
Reverend Sistrunk, these are Agents Scully
and Mulder. They want to ask you...

07:44.298 --> 07:49.052
If Dr Prince burns in hell's fire
for his murder of the unborn?

07:49.178 --> 07:51.555
If his damnation is God's will?

07:51.597 --> 07:55.434
- Is that what you think, Reverend?
- I guess it's a question of opinion.

07:55.601 --> 07:59.354
In my opinion, Dr Prince's killer
will be linked to two other murders.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.899
How do you feel about that?

08:01.982 --> 08:06.737
There are those who endorse the killing
of the heathen sinner in God's name.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.572
But I am not one of them.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.450
Have you been to New York
or New Jersey recently?

08:11.575 --> 08:13.577
No, sir.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.205
This clipping, where'd you get it?

08:17.372 --> 08:22.336
From the newspaper. Obviously, more
of God's soldiers are seeking this man.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.506
- Which newspaper?
- The local paper up in Binghamton.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.676
Yeah, I remember this one.
The man who placed this paid cash.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.679
- Would you recognise his face?
- Might.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.224
No. That's not him.

08:35.349 --> 08:39.977
- Do you have his name or address?
- No, we don't. He wouldn't sign anything.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.688
In fact, he called to place
that ad a second week...

08:42.773 --> 08:45.817
...so we did, but... he never came back to pay.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.653
Thank you.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.821
I've got a bad feeling about this case.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.616
- What do you mean?
- Nothing about it makes sense.

08:52.658 --> 08:56.912
We've got three deaths of identical victims.
No bodies, a non-suspect.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.248
Sounds just like an <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font>.

08:59.373 --> 09:03.377
You don't know who sent you
that information. We've been set up before.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.966
If we were being set up,
would we be given this little to go on?

09:09.091 --> 09:13.095
There's something bigger here, Scully.
I'll bet there are more of these guys.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.014
- More victims?
- Unless we get to them first.

09:16.098 --> 09:20.269
The deaths follow a pattern.
New Jersey, New York, Scranton...

09:20.394 --> 09:24.690
Then an ad is placed here in Binghamton
looking for a man exactly like the others.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.985
The killer's moving in a northerly direction.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.112
Uh... Excuse me.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.738
Excuse me.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.533
The number in the ad,
would that be a voice mail?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.659
Yes.

09:35.701 --> 09:40.581
- How would you access that?
- Well, you'd start by paying the bill.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.172
Dial the number, then press 1236.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.771
There's 24 messages responding to the ad.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.902
First caller's seen the man
in the photo in Syracuse.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.904
That's north.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.617
- Special Agent Weiss.
- This is Agent Mulder.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.286
- I need to enlist your help.
- Shoot.

10:19.328 --> 10:23.332
I'm with Agent Scully. We believe
a man in your area may be in danger.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.752
His name is Dr Aaron Baker.
He's living in Syracuse.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.630
We need you to sit on him
until we can get there.

10:29.671 --> 10:34.468
You got it. I'll call you back with an address
as soon as I track him down.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.259
Your plans will not succeed.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.734
Federal agent. Drop your weapon.
I said drop it!

11:40.284 --> 11:42.244
What the hell...?

12:13.650 --> 12:17.154
- Agent Mulder?
- Yes. Agent Weiss?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.739
Yes, sir.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.575
- Did you find Dr Baker?
- No, I'm afraid not.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.494
No one's home.
There's two weeks' mail in the mailbox.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.497
We may be too late.
We should take a look around anyway.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.083
Not much to see.

13:26.849 --> 13:30.269
- Agent Mulder has arrived.
- Send him right in.

13:34.398 --> 13:38.151
- Agent Mulder, please have a seat.
- I'm sorry I'm late. I just flew in.

13:38.277 --> 13:39.862
- From?
- Syracuse.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.991
- Where you were doing what?
- Agent Scully and I were following up a lead.

13:44.116 --> 13:47.536
- Did anyone authorise this investigation?
- No, sir.

13:47.578 --> 13:50.873
- Do you have paperwork on this case?
- No, sir.

13:50.956 --> 13:54.001
We had an understanding
with respect to the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.130
Agent Mulder, the people I answer to
aren't quite so understanding.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.258
Particularly when a field agent is found dead.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.051
What?

14:03.177 --> 14:05.888
Special Agent Barrett Weiss, Syracuse office.

14:06.013 --> 14:10.559
His body was found in the trunk of a car
in front of a house that you sent him to.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.729
It's impossible.
I spoke to Agent Weiss at the house.

14:13.854 --> 14:18.734
Save it for your report! Until this matter is
cleared up, your butt and mine are in a sling!

14:18.775 --> 14:22.779
And your investigation,
official or otherwise, is terminated.

14:22.988 --> 14:28.452
Don't underestimate the seriousness of this,
Agent Mulder. A man is dead.

14:32.206 --> 14:35.918
I want a full accounting
on my desk in the morning.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.693
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.531
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.659
- Agent Weiss is dead, Scully.
- What?

15:08.700 --> 15:13.539
He was killed and Skinner hit the roof. We're
grounded until he gets a full accounting.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.834
I just wish I knew what the hell was going on.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.963
- Have you checked your e-mail, Mulder?
- No. Why?

15:21.088 --> 15:24.967
I received something unsettling
and I wondered if you'd gotten it, too.

15:25.008 --> 15:29.137
- What is it?
- It's a digitally-scanned photograph.

15:29.263 --> 15:33.517
There's another one, Mulder.
His name is Dr James Dickens.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.143
- And, Mulder...
- Yeah.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.563
He's right here in Washington.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.983
Stay where you are, Scully. I'll pick you up.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.880
Agent Mulder?

16:03.172 --> 16:05.465
My name is Ambrose Chapel.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.553
I work for the Central Intelligence Agency.

16:09.595 --> 16:13.891
I need to talk to you about the case
you're working on.

16:14.016 --> 16:18.729
- What case is that?
- The murder of certain identical victims.

16:18.770 --> 16:22.900
I have a story to tell, Agent Mulder.
Believe me, you wanna hear it.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.736
We've known of their existence for a decade.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.280
We found out they were
in the country last year.

16:28.322 --> 16:29.740
Who were they?

16:29.865 --> 16:33.744
Vague intelligence reports
reveal that, early in the Cold War...

16:33.785 --> 16:39.625
...Soviet scientists stumbled on a genetic
anomaly in sets of identical twins.

16:39.750 --> 16:45.923
They isolated the DNA material that gave
the twins their facial features, hair colour...

16:45.964 --> 16:48.759
...and they were able to reproduce it.

16:49.218 --> 16:53.597
- Are you saying these men are clones?
- By all outward appearances.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.809
How did they get here?

16:57.935 --> 17:02.481
The programme went by the code name
"Gregor" - the name given to every clone.

17:02.523 --> 17:07.194
We believe the original Gregor came here
in the mid-'70s on a German passport.

17:07.236 --> 17:12.366
Using that same document, they were able
to bring a small cadre of clones in...

17:12.491 --> 17:16.828
...several of which are in strategic positions
in the medical establishment.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.247
For what purpose?

17:18.372 --> 17:23.210
In the event of war, they would
mobilise simultaneously across the US...

17:23.252 --> 17:28.089
...to contaminate blood supplies,
sabotage pharmaceutical factories.

17:28.131 --> 17:31.385
Essentially, destroy
the country's immune system.

17:31.510 --> 17:35.264
If you've known about this for a year,
why hasn't anything been done?

17:35.389 --> 17:38.976
Well, this is where the story gets
perhaps even more incredible.

17:39.017 --> 17:43.564
Secretly, someone is allowing the Gregors
to be systematically eliminated...

17:43.689 --> 17:47.317
...by a man who I believe
is a Russian spy-killer...

17:47.401 --> 17:50.988
...in exchange for the suppression
of the programme's existence...

17:51.029 --> 17:54.116
...and to obtain the science that created it.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.159
What's your business in this?

17:56.285 --> 18:00.414
We share similar sentiments
on our government's policies of denial...

18:00.455 --> 18:03.250
...which is why they've been
trying to contact you.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.711
- Who?
- The Gregors.

18:06.461 --> 18:11.842
You're obviously someone who might protect
them and bring these misdeeds to light.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.014
What makes you think we've been contacted?

18:17.139 --> 18:19.892
Your inquiries into their deaths.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.316
And your response to the ad I placed.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.781
We're talking state-sanctioned murder.

18:34.907 --> 18:38.744
If we can find them first,
maybe the truth can be known.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.167
We know where one of these men may be.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.701
OK, let's go.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.872
- Who is it?
- Agents Scully and Mulder.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.249
We're with the FBI.

20:12.421 --> 20:15.007
- Dr Dickens?
- Yes.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.051
I believe you've been trying to contact us.

20:18.177 --> 20:20.262
Uh...

20:20.304 --> 20:23.432
- May we come in, Dr Dickens?
- Uh...

20:23.557 --> 20:27.144
It's OK, sir. There's nothing to be afraid of.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.362
I'll call the paramedics.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.326
He's moving.

20:42.451 --> 20:45.204
He's getting up!

20:49.333 --> 20:51.502
I'll call you back.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.921
- You OK?
- OK.

21:35.963 --> 21:39.091
I just got the wind knocked out of me.
Don't lose him!

21:39.216 --> 21:41.260
- Go!
- OK.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.622
Oh...

22:53.040 --> 22:54.499
He's gone.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.668
- Where?
- He blindsided me.

22:56.752 --> 22:59.213
Went up the fire escape
before I could grab him.

22:59.338 --> 23:02.925
I'm gonna go see if I can
find a way up on the roof.

23:51.223 --> 23:55.561
- How are you feeling?
- Like I should have used the crosswalk.

23:55.686 --> 23:57.855
A lot better than my phone.

23:58.564 --> 24:00.983
Maybe we should have dropped this case.

24:01.024 --> 24:06.822
Scully, if our friend from the CIA is right,
this is a big national security conspiracy.

24:06.864 --> 24:10.617
Our friend from the CIA is
about as unbelievable as his story.

24:10.701 --> 24:14.329
As is everything about this case.
What happened to "Trust no one", Mulder?

24:14.413 --> 24:17.332
I changed it to "Trust everyone."
I didn't tell you

24:17.416 --> 24:19.710
I ran a full background check on this guy.

24:19.751 --> 24:26.008
Ambrose Chapel is a 17-year veteran, special
intelligence clearance. He's the real thing.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.304
Why would a man with his experience
need our help?

24:30.345 --> 24:34.975
And how could he let a man that he's been
looking so hard for slip away so easily?

24:35.017 --> 24:39.021
That doctor wasn't running away
from us, Mulder, but Agent Chapel.

24:39.062 --> 24:43.025
- I think you're being overly paranoid, Scully.
- Paranoid.

24:43.066 --> 24:46.653
Maybe it was Agent Chapel
who killed that field agent in Syracuse.

24:46.737 --> 24:50.782
Shall I put that on my report to Skinner?
I'd be happy for you to explain it to him.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.951
Dammit, Mulder, that is not my job.

24:53.035 --> 24:56.038
You'll pursue a case to the point of insanity...

24:56.163 --> 24:59.958
...and expect me to follow you.
There has to be somewhere to draw the line.

25:00.042 --> 25:04.213
Three identical men are dead. A fourth
identical man is alive and on the lam.

25:04.338 --> 25:08.300
If this case seems like insanity to you,
feel free to step away from it.

25:08.342 --> 25:10.802
An FBI agent died because of this case.

25:10.928 --> 25:15.224
Those are the risks we take.
You either accept them or you don't.

25:15.307 --> 25:18.352
We all draw our own lines.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.650
I have to show you something.

25:29.404 --> 25:32.074
I got these a week ago.

25:33.242 --> 25:37.204
I stepped in something last night
that ate clean through the sole.

25:37.246 --> 25:43.627
Maybe I'm paranoid, but it was in the exact
spot where Chapel said the doctor escaped.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.090
Why don't you send it
to our lab guys for analysis?

25:48.215 --> 25:51.552
- And arrange for an autopsy bay.
- An autopsy bay?

25:51.677 --> 25:55.806
Putting together my report for Skinner,
I found something you'll appreciate.

25:55.848 --> 26:02.437
Whoever killed that agent in Syracuse was so
clever, no clear cause of death can be found.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.108
No penetrating knife or gunshot wounds.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.570
No ligature marks
or abrasions from strangulation.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.822
The toxicological is clean.

26:12.614 --> 26:16.618
- And the blood work... Well, it's strange.
- Strange how?

26:16.702 --> 26:21.039
There's evidence of polycythaemia -
excessive production of red blood cells.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.417
- How excessive?
- Extremely.

26:23.542 --> 26:27.171
The doctor has it in here
that the blood was curdled like jelly.

26:27.254 --> 26:31.466
As if something caused the blood
to thicken or clot prior to death.

26:31.592 --> 26:32.718
Due to what?

26:32.759 --> 26:37.973
Possibly a coagulating agent, but it would
have shown up on the toxicological.

26:38.015 --> 26:43.187
Didn't Agent Chapel say these doctors
could contaminate the blood supply?

26:43.270 --> 26:48.317
Couldn't one of those contaminants
have been used to kill this man?

26:48.358 --> 26:51.028
I don't know, Mulder. I...

26:51.987 --> 26:55.490
There was a doctor's bag I took
as evidence from the apartment.

26:55.616 --> 26:56.909
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

26:56.950 --> 27:00.913
- Assistant Director Skinner's looking for you.
- I'll be right there.

27:01.038 --> 27:04.041
Check the bag. See if you
find anything that connects.

27:04.082 --> 27:08.754
Skinner's gonna want to know why you didn't
file your report. What are you gonna say?

27:08.795 --> 27:11.381
Just the truth. I got hit by a car.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.644
I'm sorry this is late. I had trouble with...

27:23.769 --> 27:27.231
That's not why I called you in here,
Agent Mulder.

27:27.314 --> 27:32.945
Your father's been trying to reach you.
There's been a family emergency.

27:33.070 --> 27:35.239
Thank you.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.540
Hello?

27:44.623 --> 27:47.668
- Mom?
- Fox, is that you?

27:48.252 --> 27:51.672
Yeah, I... I didn't expect you to answer.
Why are you at Dad's?

27:51.797 --> 27:54.925
- Is he all right?
- Yes. Let me put him on.

27:56.927 --> 27:58.971
- Hello?
- Dad?

27:59.972 --> 28:02.391
I got a message there was
a family emergency.

28:02.432 --> 28:07.855
Yes, I received a very strange phone call
this afternoon. I called your mother.

28:07.938 --> 28:10.399
We think you should come here
as soon as possible.

28:10.440 --> 28:14.653
- Can you tell me what this is about?
- I'll know more when you get here.

28:14.695 --> 28:18.407
I didn't find anything much to go on,
but we've got an address.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.242
Check it out.

28:20.284 --> 28:23.245
- Where are you going?
- Home.

29:50.249 --> 29:54.211
This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.548
Mulder, it's me.
I need to talk to you immediately.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.384
I've got some new information on this case.

30:00.509 --> 30:02.553
Mulder, I think I'm in danger.

30:02.678 --> 30:06.390
I'm in my apartment
and I think I've been followed.

30:25.242 --> 30:27.578
Your mother needs some time.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.459
You said it was an emergency.

30:45.888 --> 30:48.599
She wanted you to come.

30:48.640 --> 30:53.562
It's a difficult time. I appreciate
you coming at such short notice.

30:53.604 --> 30:56.023
What is it, Dad?

30:57.024 --> 31:03.739
The certainty... becomes
a comfort that allows you to move on.

31:05.365 --> 31:10.204
We bury our memories so deep
after all that has been destroyed...

31:10.287 --> 31:12.372
...never expecting...

31:12.497 --> 31:14.666
Who is Mom talking to?

31:17.461 --> 31:19.630
Your sister.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.657
Fox.

31:57.376 --> 32:01.255
After all those sleepless nights,
now I can hardly keep my eyes open.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.549
You're exhausted.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.260
We all are. It's after 5.30.

32:06.635 --> 32:09.304
Oh, I just need a couple of hours.

32:12.015 --> 32:14.393
Try to get some sleep.

32:18.146 --> 32:20.983
- Fox...
- Yeah, Mom?

32:21.692 --> 32:23.944
It is really her.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.156
Isn't it?

32:29.741 --> 32:32.411
I don't see who else it could be.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.291
Go on, go to sleep.

33:25.214 --> 33:27.883
Is it too late for a game of Stratego?

33:29.468 --> 33:31.762
It's 22 years too late.

33:35.474 --> 33:40.229
I don't think Dad could think of
anything to say. He just sat here.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.899
So much has happened.

33:45.359 --> 33:47.819
Where do you begin?

33:51.698 --> 33:55.202
I must have been nine or ten
when I was returned.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.997
I had no memory.

33:59.081 --> 34:03.001
I was placed with a family
who raised me as a daughter.

34:04.503 --> 34:07.214
Who were they?

34:07.256 --> 34:11.552
I knew they weren't my parents,
but I didn't remember Mom or Dad.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.719
Or you.

34:15.681 --> 34:19.560
But you came to remember... us.

34:22.563 --> 34:25.399
I started having trouble several years ago.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.860
It was diagnosed as free-floating anxiety.

34:30.112 --> 34:33.114
Nothing worked for me. I hit rock bottom.

34:33.866 --> 34:37.536
Until I underwent regression hypnotherapy.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.998
And it all started coming back.

34:44.418 --> 34:47.004
The abductions...

34:47.045 --> 34:49.172
The tests...

35:07.024 --> 35:09.443
I'm in danger, Fox.

35:10.319 --> 35:13.197
- What do you mean?
- You've been contacted.

35:13.322 --> 35:17.159
You know there's a man hunting
my father and the other doctors.

35:17.201 --> 35:20.579
Your f... Your father.

35:22.206 --> 35:26.210
My adoptive parents.
They're only visitors here.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.047
What people would call aliens.

35:32.966 --> 35:37.346
A bounty hunter's been sent to kill them.
You've met this man.

35:37.387 --> 35:41.099
His lies to you have caused
others like my father to die.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.685
He won't stop until he's killed them all...

35:43.769 --> 35:46.355
...and anyone who tries to stop him.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.067
He'll come for me soon.

36:16.552 --> 36:22.558
This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

36:22.683 --> 36:25.561
Scully, it's Mulder. Pick up the phone.

36:26.228 --> 36:30.691
If you're screening, pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you.

36:32.651 --> 36:35.571
Do not, under any circumstances,
trust the CIA agent.

36:35.696 --> 36:38.574
Your life may be in danger. Now call me.

36:38.699 --> 36:43.120
She may not be able to recognise him.
He has the ability to disguise himself.

36:43.161 --> 36:46.123
- Disguise himself? How?
- As anyone.

36:46.164 --> 36:49.710
- As anyone? You gotta be kidding.
- No.

36:49.751 --> 36:52.337
You can't recognise him, but I can.

37:49.895 --> 37:53.649
Hello, this is Fox Mulder.
Leave a message, please.

37:53.774 --> 37:58.362
Mulder, it's me. I've left my apartment
and I don't think I've been followed.

37:58.403 --> 38:03.242
I'll be staying at the Vacation Village
Motorlodge off the I-90 in Germantown.

38:03.283 --> 38:09.206
When you reach me, I should have some very
important information regarding this case.

39:57.523 --> 39:58.774
Wait!

39:59.399 --> 40:01.944
Stop! Federal agent!

40:03.237 --> 40:05.781
Put your hands against the wall!

40:05.822 --> 40:08.492
- Do it!
- You won't shoot me.

40:09.535 --> 40:12.204
Put your hands against the wall.

40:12.246 --> 40:14.373
Now!

40:15.123 --> 40:17.668
You cannot harm us.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.548
Sir?

40:24.091 --> 40:26.635
It's all right.

40:31.932 --> 40:36.979
We are the last remaining.
Unless you protect us, we are already dead.

40:40.107 --> 40:42.943
Put them in maximum-security
protective custody.

40:42.985 --> 40:45.863
No visitors, no press, no anybody.

40:45.988 --> 40:48.699
- OK?
- Yeah.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.410
Can I ask? Who are these guys?

40:51.535 --> 40:54.621
I'll let you know when I figure it out myself.

41:22.357 --> 41:27.779
I should have some very
important information regarding this case.

41:29.198 --> 41:32.367
- Vacation Village.
- I need to speak to Dana Scully, please.

41:32.492 --> 41:34.745
Just a moment.

41:37.497 --> 41:40.375
I'm sorry, there's no one
registered by that name.

41:40.501 --> 41:44.171
All right, I need her to call Fox Mulder
as soon as she checks in.

41:44.213 --> 41:46.632
- Fox Mulder.
- Fox Mulder.

41:46.757 --> 41:49.760
- Yes.
- Will do.

41:55.766 --> 41:58.101
Who's this message for?

42:00.354 --> 42:04.525
- I'd like a single for one night, please.
- Ah! See what I got.

42:54.449 --> 42:57.703
- Whose post is this?
- Mine, sir. We're on changeover.

42:57.828 --> 43:00.163
I'm gonna talk to the prisoners.

43:02.457 --> 43:05.169
You wanna get me a coffee?
Sugar and milk, no cream.

43:05.252 --> 43:08.589
- Do you want me to keep an eye open?
- No, just get me the coffee.

43:08.714 --> 43:10.757
Yes, sir.

43:38.911 --> 43:41.747
- Who is it?
- Scully, it's me.

43:47.794 --> 43:50.047
- I got your message.
- Where have you been?

43:54.760 --> 43:58.055
- Scully.
- Scully, it's me. Where are you?

43:58.639 --> 44:00.933
Scully? Are you there?

44:03.644 --> 44:05.771
Scully?

44:14.720 --> 44:19.305
