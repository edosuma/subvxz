WHISPERING CORRIDORS

01:13.000 --> 01:17.720
This is Hur Eun-Young. I can't answer
the phone, so leave your message.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
2nd year, 3rd year...

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
2nd year, 3rd year...

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
2nd year, 3rd year...

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Mrs. Park, you're still here?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Had to check something.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.900
I'll be leaving soon.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.800
Guess the new semester's keeping you busy.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.900
Need any help?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm fine.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.900
Library

04:14.000 --> 04:14.900
Hello?

04:15.000 --> 04:15.900
Eun-Young?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Mrs. Park?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Jin-Ju is here.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Jin-Ju?

04:26.000 --> 04:26.900
I don't know.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
What are you talking about?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.720
Jin-Ju has died for sure.
But she's here.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.900
Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.900
Mrs. Park...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Eun-Young? Hello?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.900
What are you doing here?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Uh? Waiting for you.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
What?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.900
What did you say?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.900
I was waiting for you.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
For me?
Why?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Why were you waiting for me?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.320
We're the class clerks of the week.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.120
Youn Yae-Yi, trying to
make me feel guilty eh?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.200
I'm actually 15 minutes
early, thanks to my mom.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.520
Of course you're not, I'm a bit early.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.120
We never promised to meet here.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.400
You should have waited in the classroom.
It's cold.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Empty classrooms give
me the creeps, sorry...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Stop moping.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
You'll jinx my chance of spending
this senior year in style.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.920
Want to become a schoolgate ghost?
Come on.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
What's this?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.720
I'm not sure, only that she's possessed.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.900
Possessed?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.520
You know, by a grade ghost.
One with a low IQ though.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.900
Were you good friends?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.520
Does she look like she would like me?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, I forgot to bring a rag.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Hey!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.900
What...?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.600
Give me that you dufus.
No need to take those back up.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Hurry up.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Ji-Oh.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.120
It is your duty as her students.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.600
Anyone who damages her reputation
with rumors will never be forgiven.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
You heard.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.920
Don't distract the other students
with gossip, understand?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's all for the best, Okay?

14:07.000 --> 14:12.520
Fortunately, we're swearing this oath of
honor... before all hell breaks loose.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.400
You'll all be held responsible
if anything happens.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.900
Got it.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yes sir.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Got it.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.900
Yes sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.120
You'll take the blame for rumors
coming from Rm.3. Understood!

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Yes sir.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Why did she do it?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.920
It's not clear. The
police needs more leads.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.600
You could kill yourself for any reason...
But why do it at school?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm sorry.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.800
The principal will assign a new
homeroom teacher for Rm3.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.320
Special instructions will be given.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.720
But make sure this is kept confidential.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Hey! Are you sure?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Ever see me tell a lie?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
This is for real.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Suicide?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.320
Not all suicides are by hanging.
This case stinks.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.920
Most of the students
wanted to kill old fox.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Jin-Ju is here.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.900
Really? For me?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.800
Isn't it a family heirloom? Thanks Jin-Ju.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.200
Is your Dad still drinking a lot?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't know.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Don't be so cold.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.320
Did you hear? Jung-Sook
was the first to be here.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.200
Yeah, and she wasn't even
the clerk of the week.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.900
She was there even before the clerks.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.200
Remember last weeks shouting
match with Old Fox?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Making out you two?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.720
Go work in a factory. If you can cut it?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Or stay at home. You hear?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Degenerates.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.120
Look at your uniform. Hands out.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You're such a bad influence.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
What's this smell? Incense?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.720
It figures.
Having a Shaman for a mother.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Miss Hur.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Miss Hur...

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
A penny for your thoughts.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You weren't answering.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh, were you calling me?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.800
You're the only teacher by that last name.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.720
Sorry, I still feel like a student here.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Really?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.520
So Mrs. Park used to be your
senior homeroom teacher?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.120
Her death must have shocked you.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.320
She said she had something to check.
I assumed it was important.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.900
What was she checking?

20:31.000 --> 20:35.320
I'm not sure,...but she was
staring at her class agenda book.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Jin-Ju's died for sure.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.520
But she's here.
Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's not you.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.600
I just don't feel like it.
So childish.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Do it on your own.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.200
Nobody else can call the spirits.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Just this one time. Please?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.120
Oh mighty spirit, come to us...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.400
Draw us a circle if you are with us.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.720
Draw us a circle if she is a virgin.
An X if she is not.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.900
Having fun?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Get your asses over here.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.920
What the fuck is Mad Dog
doing in our class?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.920
Hasn't senior year put some sense into you?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.120
If you're so psychic,
make a living out of it.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.900
Why bother with school?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I asked her for my grades.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.120
Lim Ji-Oh, are you a
Shaman or a witch doctor?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.920
Then get better grades. You're
lowering the class average.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Get out of my sight.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Who is it?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.520
Who's the smart ass who just laughed?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.520
I see...
Everyone on your desks, now.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.320
I'll teach you a lesson. Arms up!

24:20.000 --> 24:23.720
Can't you greet your new
homeroom teacher with respect?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Homeroom teacher?

24:30.000 --> 24:34.520
Due to personal matters,
Mrs. Park is unable to continu her duties.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.320
I will be taking over,... you hear?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
This means two things.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
One, a better chance at
getting into college.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.200
Two, no personal life for a year.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.920
The new semester of your senior year...
is getting you somewhat excited...

25:05.000 --> 25:08.600
I advise you to get rid of
such cheap sentimentalisms.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.920
They're luxuries a senior
should do without.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Got it!

25:16.000 --> 25:18.200
KEEP YOUR OWN PLACE.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.720
This will be the class motto from now on.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.120
You're each other's rival,... but frankly
speaking you're each other's enemy.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.520
The worst enemy in war is yourself.
You CAN defeat your inner enemy.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
You can be a winner.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.200
I've re-scheduled the exercise
exams for tomorrow. Be prepared.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.120
Get used to it and stop whining!

25:58.000 --> 26:00.600
It's for evaluation purposes, so relax.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.600
If you don't have what it takes, tough.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.320
Class dismissed. Start cleaning up.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.320
Dang, wish we had exams every day.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.900
What?

26:59.000 --> 26:59.900
Then school ends early.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.120
Bitch, exams never kept
you from leaving early.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.900
You're always the first to
dive outta da classroom.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.600
It's better to chill after the exams...

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Bullshit!

27:14.000 --> 27:14.900
Ow, ouch.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.900
Stuck?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.900
Aw, fuck. It's blocked.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.520
Didn't we get pierced on the same day?

27:28.000 --> 27:28.900
Ouch.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.720
Stop whining bitch.
See it's going in.

27:33.000 --> 27:33.900
Stop it, it hurts.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.520
I'm trying to take it out you slut.
Want a bloody slit up your nose?

27:45.000 --> 27:45.900
Hey!

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Whatcha lookin at?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Huh, are you ignoring me?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
What's all the fuss?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.400
You psychic, mind your own business!

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Hur Eun-Young

29:20.000 --> 29:23.120
I'll ask them to replace
the missing yearbooks.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
So you're an alumni.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.900
How did you know?

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
You were pretty famous as the student
with looks and brains.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
My grades were so so,
and the yearbook shows prettier girls.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.320
Why did you choose to be a teacher?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.320
I guess it's not so bad after all.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.920
Can I drop the formalities
when we're alone?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
If you insist.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.600
The teachers often compare us together.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.520
But they say I'm prettier and smarter.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.900
You're definitely prettier,
but do you also get good grades?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.900
Yes, I'm applying for Seoul
National University.

30:22.000 --> 30:22.900
What major?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.720
Does it matter? After all, it's the best.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.920
There must be something that interests you.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.720
Nothing special. Besides I hate studying.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.720
Once I get admitted, I'm done with books.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.920
An SNU degree is a gold
card for everything.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.720
Even with an SNU degree, it
wouldn't hurt reading Joyce.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.320
How come you're still here?
Aren't you going home?

31:13.000 --> 31:16.600
I didn't have the chance...
to thank you in the toilet.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.600
You like to do girly things, don't you?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Thanks anyway.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Have a seat.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Practicing for art school?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.600
Nope. I'm supposed to have no talent...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
How would you know?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.320
My mom said... it's a waste of time.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
She's right.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
This is just for fun.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Can I see...?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
?!...No. It's embarrassing.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I guess it is embarrassing.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.520
You're breaking my heart.
Okay, I'll show it to you.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I told you so.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Why paint something so scary?

33:19.000 --> 33:23.720
School can be a horrific experience...
for both students and teachers.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.120
Like witnessing a tragic death.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Do you get it?

33:44.000 --> 33:48.720
I guess that's why I can't erase...
the image of Old Fox from my head.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
It's like an inspiration.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.900
Terrific.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.900
What is?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.320
You are. You speak like an artist.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.320
You're kidding. I can't even paint.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.520
Of course you can. You need
to improve your skills...

34:13.000 --> 34:15.520
but you know how to control light.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.520
Bad paintings drain the life
out of their objects...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.320
because they lack this quality.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.520
This painting has it. You
have a good eye for things,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.199
the most important element
to be a good painter.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.120
You must have studied painting.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
A bit.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.900
When? In Junior high?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.320
Something like that. I quit though.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
No talent like you know who.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.600
Jae-Ji, will you teach me how to paint?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.120
You can join me when you
get bored of teaching.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.900
No?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Is it a yes or no?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.600
Allright, if you insist.
Promise that you do as I say.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.320
Now you sound like Mad Dog.
We're mortal enemies.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Don't tell me your his niece?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Isn't this great Jin-Ju?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Miss Hur.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
What are you doing at my desk?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Is this your desk?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Yes.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.200
What brings you to our classroom?

38:31.000 --> 38:35.120
This used to be my senior year homeroom.
Brings back memories.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.120
It's still pretty much the same.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I didn't do that.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I know... I did it.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Was this your desk?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.400
No, it was my friend's,... Jin-Ju's.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Excuse me.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.600
Jin-Ju, this will be your desk forever.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Here.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.920
I found her address in my diary.
I want to meet her family.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.720
I explain later. It's really
important that you find it.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.520
I'll drop by later to get it.
Bye mom.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Looking for an old flame?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.320
No, a girlfriend from high school.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Lost touch after graduation?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.900
Kind of.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Can't call that friendship.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.320
Guess it happens when you're busy.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
She died in high school.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.920
Oh the student who committed suicide?
Was she your friend?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.320
Yes you were in Mrs. Park's class.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.600
But why are you looking for her family?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Just curious.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Go to the school storage room.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.120
Her ghost haunts the place.
You'll get to meet her in person.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.120
A couple of girls claim
they've seen the ghost.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.520
She died in the art room.
It used to be the art room.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.120
She must have jinxed the place.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.920
Construction workers
have been sick or hurt.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.800
That's why they can't tear down the place.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.920
Of all the places to die why choose school?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Lim Ji-Oh, you piece of shit!

44:07.000 --> 44:11.520
The vp almost had a heart attack
when he found this in the art room.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
How would you explain this?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.800
Answer me!
Are you trying to fuck with me?

44:22.000 --> 44:22.900
No sir.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Don't bullshit me!

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
You degenerate.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.920
You must be a psycho, a maniac.
Some parents you must have.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.520
Letting you create such a monstrosity.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.400
Get out of my sight. You disgust me!

44:54.000 --> 44:55.900
Go.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Go! Go!

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Go! Go! Go!

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I dare you.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.900
You psycho.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
You wanna die?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Die! Die! You filth...

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I told your mom not to worry.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.320
She's sensitive about your
first exam as a senior.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.900
If you have finished, I
would like to excuse...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
What's the hurry?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I should get back to my books.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.720
Don't be a stranger to your own teacher.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.200
A woman should be like cotton candy.
Understand?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So-Young.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.920
So-Young. Do you know where I can find
that painting of your classmate's?

46:52.000 --> 46:55.520
It must've been trashed.
Mad Dog chewed it to pieces.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Mad Dog?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.720
I apologize.
That's what we call Mr. Oh.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Shouldn't it be pervert?

47:11.000 --> 47:11.900
Who's painting is it?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Lim Ji-Oh...

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I see...

47:22.000 --> 47:24.920
It's for the best. No
more painting for me..

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Giving up painting?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Nowhere to paint.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.200
There's one place.
The teachers will never know.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Never mind.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.900
What?

47:55.000 --> 47:56.900
Let's go.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Where?
I was just joking.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
You can't go there.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Why not?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's a mess, cobwebs and rats.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.900
We'll just take a look.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.320
Are you nuts? The place is haunted.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.920
Then stay here.
I'll check for ghosts, okay?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Who taught you to smoke?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.520
No one. Ever see me learn from anyone?

49:22.000 --> 49:26.120
How brave of you.
Even the teachers are scared of this place.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I prefer ghosts.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.720
Besides, didn't you know. I'm one myself.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.120
So is this that infamous place?

49:48.000 --> 49:51.320
Then lend me some space.
I need a place to paint.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.320
I've been banned from the art room.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Don't you want to kill him?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.320
Yeah, why don't you do the honors?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.120
You have to pay rent.
Finders keepers you know.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Plus I'll keep my mouth shut.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.900
Rent?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.600
Aren't you supposed to be a rich bitch?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I'm sorry.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.320
I came to ask you something
and the door was open.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It's okay. Have a seat.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.200
Miss Hur, no need to feel guilty.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.920
Wow,... someone did quite a number on this.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.900
Why bring it here?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.720
I was curious. But the faculty lounge...

51:29.000 --> 51:30.900
It is uncomfortable there.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.400
I guess I still feel like a student.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.520
Think so?
Perhaps it's more than that.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.400
Do you usually sketch student faces?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I like their expressions.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.200
Didn't you have something to ask?

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Uh... about this painting.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Hello there.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
You were saying.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.200
I was in the art club when
I was in high school.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
So you used to paint.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.120
No, I sculpted faces in plaster.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.900
Sculpted?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.600
I used to do friend's faces as a hobby.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Must have been a great gift.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I hope they were.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.900
Excuse me.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Just a moment, Ji-Oh.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.900
Here.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Take it.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Don't give up painting.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.900
KEEP YOUR PLACE

53:36.000 --> 53:38.520
Park So-Young. School rank, 1st place.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.200
Go ahead and give her a big hand.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Kim Jung-Sook.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.920
Your class rank is 2nd place,
yet your school rank is 25th.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.600
What's the use of studying long hours
if you're not paying attention.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.800
If you don't have the brains,
ask So-Young for some tips.

54:13.100 --> 54:13.999
Class head.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.900
Yes.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.900
Hand them out after I'm gone.
Dismissed!

54:18.000 --> 54:18.900
Attention.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.900
Don't bother.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.720
How can the class with the school's
best student have the worst score?

54:26.000 --> 54:30.120
Don't greet me until you improve
the class average, you hear!

55:03.000 --> 55:05.800
Do you have Mrs. Park's class agenda book?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.800
No, but perhaps the PE teacher would know.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.720
Night patrolling with female teachers...

55:24.000 --> 55:25.900
the perfect solution for lonely nights.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
What do you think?
Not bad eh?

55:41.000 --> 55:41.900
What's wrong?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Too much dust.
Look.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.600
You have a vain side to you, don't you?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.320
Aren't you scared of this place?
Ghosts and all...

55:59.000 --> 56:01.920
On the contrary, I feel at ease.
Like home.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.900
Really?

56:09.000 --> 56:10.900
Why? Don't you?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Anything you say.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Strange.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
God damn it!

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
What the... ow!

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Who's there?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Who are you?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.900
Order.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.120
I'll be filling in for Mr.
Oh today. So behave.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.900
He didn't come in today?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Is anything wrong?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
How should I know?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.900
Kim Nuri.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.900
Choi An-Nat...

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.900
Here.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.720
He must have fallen asleep in the sauna.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Nothing can wake you there.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.900
You think a ghost got him?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Kim Yung-Sook, Kim Yung-Sook.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.900
Is that her seat?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:29.900
Yes Sir.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.900
Is she absent or late?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.900
She hasn't come in yet.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
What gives? She's never late.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.720
It was Mad Dog's turn. The ghost got him.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.900
I'm positive.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Where did you get that from?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.200
Do I still look like your friend?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:54.900
Hey...

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.900
Stop it.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Look, isn't that Jung-Sook?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.320
I'm sure he was killed last night.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
What makes you think so?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.800
I feel it. Just like the day Old Fox died.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.400
I feel like I killed Mad Dog myself.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.320
You think I was possessed...
and murdered Mad Dog?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.120
Whoever did it, aren't
you glad that he's gone?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.320
Look, I'm not joking. I'm serious.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.120
What if I'm really possessed...?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Ji-Oh, don't be so serious.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.720
Don't worry. He's a die-hard.
He must be playing hooky.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.120
Do as I say Eun-Young.
You'll thank me one day.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.520
You won't regret it. You
need to choose your friends.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
She's no good for you.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.900
Looking for this?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yes...

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
What for?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.120
It's only going to depress you.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
NAME; LIM JI-OH

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
EVALUATION NOTES

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.120
LACKS THE ABILITY AND
WILL TO APPLY FOR COLLEGE

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Oh, it's you So-Young.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.899
Any problems?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
No,... nothing.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.600
Did you say there were spare yearbooks?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.720
No, they suddenly disappeared.
So stupid.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.120
So typical of the school system.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Have you found the painting?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.899
Huh?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.200
Of Ji-Oh's. You wanted to see it.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.520
Oh yes, I did.
Do you know Ji-Oh well?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Not much. She sits next to me.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Why?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Nothing special, apart from her
ability to call the spirits.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.899
Call the spirits?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.520
Probably her way of getting attention.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.920
If you're so curious, she's in
the store room, painting...

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
What's this noise?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
What are you doing?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Get your ass over here.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Now.
I said now!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
What brings you here?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So now you're following me.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Forget it.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.520
I have nothing against you.
Never avoided you either.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.120
Let's just say we're different.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Meet me after evening studies.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Why?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Can't we talk now?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.520
Is your sister coming to pick you up?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Sister?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.120
Sorry, was that your stepmother?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
She looks so young.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Kim Jung-Sook,...

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
mind your own business.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.720
Is your real mom still in the looney bin?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.320
Bitch. To think I took pity on you.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.720
You think you could beat me? Guess again.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.120
You don't have what it takes.
We're different.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Got it...?
Loser!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.520
Your Mother will save you.
After all she's a shaman.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.920
I never spread those rumors about your mom.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
It was Mrs. Park who told me.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.600
I was scared of being ostracized
for taking your side.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.320
I never thought that
anything bad would happen...

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.320
She threatened to expel you for my sake,
if I kept seeing you...

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I was afraid.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I'm so sorry Jin-Ju.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.720
TO MY BEST FRIEND,
EUN-YOUNG, FROM JIN-JU

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.320
Does it look like you Jin-Ju?
Don't ever loose it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.900
I told you I'm Ji-Oh.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.320
Then where did you get those bells?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.900
A friend gave them to me.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Jin-Ju is dead.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.520
This is where she died 9 years ago.
I saw her body with my own eyes.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.920
She couldn't have given those bells to you.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.200
What are you talking about?
These are from Jae-Yi. Yoon Jae-Yi.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
What's wrong?
What happened?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
TO MY BEST FRIEND, JIN-JU,
FROM EUN_YOUNG, 89

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
We used to be close
during our freshman year.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.720
We would share our most private secrets.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.720
The teachers started comparing
us and we drifted apart.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
She became distant,...

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I never reached out to her...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But...

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.120
But, I never thought...
It would come to this.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
It's all my fault.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
KANG HYUN-JOO

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
PARK JI-SUNG

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.120
You should never have returned.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.320
EUN-YOUNG HAS RETURNED AS A TEACHER

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.520
ONCE AGAIN MRS. PARK HAS
BECOME THE HOMEROOM TEACHER

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
JI-OH HASN'T DESERTED ME

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.520
You're not Jae-Yi, nor are you Jin-Ju.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You're not Eun Young.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.720
I've always been and still am Eun-Young.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.320
You can never be the old Eun-Young.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.900
You'll become just like Old Fox.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You're wrong.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.520
I'm still Jin-Ju's friend, Eun-Young.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It's no use now.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I don't want to hurt you,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
but I don't have a choice.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Jae-Yi.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.900
You could never kill me.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.900
Without you, I can continu being a student.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Stop it...

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.120
What good would it do?
You're a ghost, not a student anymore!

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.920
At first, I just wanted to have a yearbook.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.920
But then I wanted more.
I needed a friend...

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.920
who really understood and cared about me...

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
But not this way!

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You're not human!

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.720
I only had to keep the classroom
full, like these desks.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Nothing more.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.400
For the past 9 years, no
one suspected my identity.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.320
Nobody cared if I was there or not.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.900
Whether I was human or
not, it didn't matter.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.520
I just had to fill the empty seats,...

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.120
and be there during headcounts.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I understand.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.900
But you have to stop now.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You don't get it now
that you're a teacher...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
What happened to you
will never happen again.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It always has and always will.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.200
Trust me Jin-Ju. I'll do my best.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I will. Trust me.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.520
There's only so much a teacher can do.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Stop it Jae-Yi.
Stop!

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.520
I don't care if you're a ghost or not.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.320
But you've gone too far this time.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.520
Don't worry Ji-Oh.
Everything will go back to normal.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
We can never... go back.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Don't worry Ji-Oh.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
You have to stop.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.920
I can't let you continu harming
the teachers, for my sake.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I've waited so long for you.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.900
I can't give up now.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Stop!

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.900
It's no use Ji-Oh.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.200
Lay a finger on her and I'm gone.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.920
Stop the horrors.
I can understand you now.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But the bloodshed has to end.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So many things I wanted to do.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.520
I pined for a friend...
who would reach out to me...

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Now I've met that friend...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I love you too,...really.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.720
But please stop...
Leave the rest to us.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Rest in peace Jae-Yi.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.920
I never intended to hurt anyone.
I just wanted a friend...

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.920
and leave with good memories.
That's all...

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I can't stay like this,...

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
cause I'm not human.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I'm so sorry.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
We'll never forget you.
