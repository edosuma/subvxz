WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:02.585
Go on, go canoodle
with your lieutenant.

00:03.087 --> 00:04.837
This was my worst
fear, Herrmann,

00:04.922 --> 00:06.798
that you guys
weren't gonna treat me
like any other candidate.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.007
You insisted on working
under Casey.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.427
Okay, so take me off of
Casey's hands, and let me
shadow you on calls.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.347
This cat Jim,
he's been playing
a sort of shell game

00:14.473 --> 00:16.557
to keep his assets out
of your sister's reach.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.850
You can't let him
get away with this.

00:19.228 --> 00:22.730
Shut up and listen, Jim.
Or I'll knock you flat
on your ass.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.986
You really think
she'd knuckle under that easy?

00:30.447 --> 00:33.783
You were gonna, what?
Run a game
and then split with the money?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.118
No one's running
any game, Matt.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.036
I'm leaving
your sister, okay?

00:37.913 --> 00:39.205
Now this can go one
of two ways.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.624
We can have an all-out
dogfight in court.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.252
Or Christie can take
the offer on the table.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.255
Two grand a month
for the next four years.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.799
What about the house?
It's still on the market.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.761
So, uh, you're okay
with leaving your wife
and daughter with no home

00:53.846 --> 00:55.138
and not enough to live on...

00:55.305 --> 00:56.389
They can keep the apartment.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.225
For the past year,
you've been moving assets
into a shell company

00:59.309 --> 01:02.311
owned by your little
piece of ass on the side,
Keri Hathaway.

01:04.148 --> 01:05.148
What's this?

01:09.236 --> 01:12.280
The documents in your hand
authorize the transactions
you're talking about.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.533
You'll note Christie
co-signed every one.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.663
You're welcome to
take those with you.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.755
You're not gonna fleece
my sister. All right?

01:29.506 --> 01:30.715
Not without getting bloody.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.016
Now, can I add to
my pass line bet?

01:40.184 --> 01:41.309
No, you have to
back it up first.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.060
Can I press the six?
You don't have money
on the six yet.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.604
Okay, okay.
Start over.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.897
There's no starting over
in craps, Capp.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.023
Come on, you're
scaring me here, bud.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.608
How about I just bet
what you bet?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.526
Hey, it's not funny.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.652
You should be
going with us.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.945
Look, I have a kid.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.822
All right, I can't abandon her
to roll with you degenerates.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.699
Fair enough.
Tony, that's a real excuse.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.327
What? My sinuses can't take
the dry heat.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.122
Hey.
Hey.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.124
How'd it go?
Not so good.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.209
Uh, Newhouse.
Yeah?

02:06.335 --> 02:07.627
You got a sec?
Uh, yeah.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.212
Excuse me. Sorry.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.760
Know any divorce attorneys?
Heavy hitter types?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.136
Yeah.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.847
Uh, use my name. Bankhead will
take care of you.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.307
All right. Thanks.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.642
Hey, man.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.060
Hey, uh, roll out
after shift.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.353
Handle that thing
we discussed?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.146
Yeah, you never told me
what the job was exactly.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.356
Oh, a little lookout
thing, man.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.482
We'll talk about it
on the way.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.400
But, anything special I need
to bring or...
Uh, nope.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.028
Cool.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.488
Truck 81,

02:35.572 --> 02:37.073
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.200
Juvenile in distress,
3304 Rosedale Avenue.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.089
Help!
I can't hold on!

02:54.383 --> 02:55.758
Help! Please, God,
help me!

02:58.095 --> 02:59.262
He's falling.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.349
I can't hold on!
I can't hold him!

03:04.268 --> 03:05.268
Please!

03:07.104 --> 03:08.521
That railing could
give out any second.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.022
Mother won't be able
to hold him for long.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.107
Jump bag?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.984
He won't survive that fall
with that thing
around his neck.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.819
Boden's tied up on
an accident investigation.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.612
You take command.
We'll throw the aerial.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.906
You fly up it.
Cruz, Otis, go.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.285
Herrmann, Dawson, stairs.
Prep for forced entry.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.456
Dawson! On his hip
means on his hip.
Not ahead of him.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.041
Understood.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.793
Let's go!
Move it, Candidate!

03:46.810 --> 03:47.810
Fire Department!

03:47.978 --> 03:48.978
Help!

03:49.438 --> 03:51.355
I can't hold on!
I can't hold him!

03:51.523 --> 03:52.773
Hang in there!

03:52.858 --> 03:55.276
Archie, no! Help us!

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
Help!

03:57.154 --> 03:59.196
It's falling.
He's falling!

04:08.373 --> 04:09.498
Oh, God!

04:09.583 --> 04:11.626
I got you.
I got it.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.923
Casey! Herrmann!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.015
Dawson, hang back.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.394
Hey. Herrmann!

04:33.982 --> 04:34.982
Ow!

04:35.067 --> 04:36.192
Be careful of his neck.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.196
Hey, buddy, buddy.
Hang on, okay?

04:41.490 --> 04:43.449
Hey, stop moving,
I don't want you to hurt
your neck, okay, bud?

04:44.368 --> 04:45.910
Herrmann, watch his neck.
Archie, please!

04:50.207 --> 04:53.542
Easy, easy, easy.
We straighten it all the way,
we could break the kid's neck.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.878
Oh, God. Oh, God.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.049
You got a favorite animal,
Archie?

05:01.635 --> 05:02.635
Snakes.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.513
Snakes?
What do you like better,
anacondas or pythons?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.057
Anacondas.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.393
Yeah, I'm a,
I'm an anaconda man myself.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.062
Let's tie this off
with some webbing.
Yeah.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.321
Okay.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.032
What about you, Mom?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.576
God, no,
I'm terrified of snakes.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.911
Take it.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.914
Find an anchor point
and tie it off.
Right.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.208
Newhouse! Sawzall!

05:36.086 --> 05:37.253
Hey, give me the sledge.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.689
Secure!

06:01.653 --> 06:03.529
The arc air torch is
on its way up, depending.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.783
Hey, Archie. What are you in,
uh, kindergarten?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.702
Uh-huh.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.162
I need you to be brave
and stay calm, okay?

06:11.997 --> 06:13.956
You can do that for me, right?
Uh-huh.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.918
Ma'am, I need you
to stand back.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.462
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

06:19.546 --> 06:20.755
No, no, no!

06:21.048 --> 06:22.715
Hey, bud, stay calm.
Easy, easy, easy.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.427
Archie.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.220
Okay, listen, this is gonna
be really loud, okay?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.556
So I want you to
cover your ears.
Can you do that for me?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.641
All right. Be brave,
you're doing great.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.311
- Okay, Casey, ready?
- Yeah.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.777
We got him.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.126
My baby.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.045
Archie.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.713
Come on.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.301
Okay, little buddy.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.513
Looking good.
All right.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.309
So, Archie,

07:15.685 --> 07:19.897
guess which one of us
raised a family of corn snakes
when she was a kid?

07:20.524 --> 07:21.524
You?
You got it.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.275
Lean forward for me, buddy.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.194
The dad was called Gus.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.905
And the mom, her name was
Toothpaste.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.616
Can you turn your head
for me, sweetheart?

07:33.245 --> 07:37.456
And I'll tell you all about
how Gus and Toothpaste
had babies on the way back.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.666
What do you say?

07:38.875 --> 07:39.917
Mmm-hmm.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.045
Thank you.
Good Lord.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.089
Did my hair turn gray?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.465
No, you were great.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.927
Look, there's no reason to
take Archie to the hospital.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.512
I mean, clearly there's
nothing wrong with him.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.973
Well, it's up to the
paramedics to make that call,

07:54.057 --> 07:55.724
but it's standard procedure
to...

07:55.851 --> 07:57.685
But I, I mean,
in his case,

07:57.769 --> 07:59.019
he doesn't have to, right?

07:59.938 --> 08:00.938
I mean, he's fine.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.523
Like I said,
it's not my call.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.779
He's perfectly fine.
Aren't you, Archie?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.406
Yeah.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.699
Ma'am, given that
he's a minor,

08:11.783 --> 08:14.201
I'm making the call
to transport your son
to the hospital.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.828
Now, you're welcome to ride
with us if you'd like.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.788
Fine. I...

08:23.170 --> 08:24.753
Can I have a word?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.630
Sure. What's up, Candidate?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.049
I trained on sledge
at the Academy.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.342
You didn't have to yank it
out of my hands.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.969
You a baseball fan, Dawson?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.929
Kinda.
Yeah?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.807
The Academy,
that's like T-ball. This?

08:36.892 --> 08:39.393
This is the bigs.
Stick with me,
I'll school you.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.400
Your partner?

08:46.484 --> 08:49.028
Uh, he's re-stocking the ambo.
But I was the primary.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.323
Uh, what I'm getting at
is whether you detected any
indications of physical abuse?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.409
Abuse? No. I mean, no.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.786
The reason I ask is
because his file was flagged.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.457
Three years ago,
Child Protective Services
took him away from his mother

09:02.042 --> 09:03.292
on suspicion of abuse
and neglect.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.795
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!
Please don't take him!

09:08.131 --> 09:09.673
Mommy! Mommy!
Please don't take him, no!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.717
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Archie!

09:12.135 --> 09:15.471
Please don't do this.
No, please. Please.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.264
Oh, my God.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.016
Mommy, stop them!
Why are they taking me?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.685
Mommy, Mommy!
Oh, my God!

09:33.531 --> 09:34.823
Gabby?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
Hey.
Hey.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.954
I can't make it.
What? Why?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.455
Herrmann asked me
to stay late.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.083
He wants me to set up
a practice station
for the sledge.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.835
Yeah. Remember,
it's Herrmann.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.504
He likes to go overboard.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.630
It's gonna be fine.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.340
Christie will be bummed.
She was hoping you'd be there.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.925
I know.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.510
But, "On his hip means
on his hip, Dawson."

09:56.179 --> 09:57.554
Fair point, Candidate.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.639
See you at home, Lieutenant.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.103
We appreciate you taking
the time to see us,

10:04.187 --> 10:05.646
especially on such
short notice.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.897
Anything for Newhouse.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.024
Thanks.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.527
So, um, as I explained
on the phone,

10:11.778 --> 10:14.863
my sister didn't know exactly
what she was signing.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.740
Jim kept her in the dark
on most financial matters.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.117
Uh, forgive me
for being abrupt.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.119
But I spoke with
opposing counsel.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.538
And bottom line is I'd be
happy to represent you.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.165
I think you've got
an eminently winnable case.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.335
That's great to hear.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.379
Clearly there's more money
than your husband lets on.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.256
No question.
All right.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.799
Where do we go
from here?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.969
First, we file a preliminary
injunction to keep him
from moving any more assets.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.470
And then we hire
a forensic accountant.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.264
That sounds expensive.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.850
I use the best firm
in Chicago.
So it won't be cheap.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.560
But I'll take your case
on contingency,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.020
so it's not gonna cost you
a penny up front.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.981
I need you to understand,
however, what you're about
to get into.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.025
What starts out as
a financial battle

10:51.109 --> 10:52.901
often ends up as
an all-out custody war.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.696
It's not gonna be easy
on anybody, least of all you.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.242
Odds are we can recover
50, 60% of the assets.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.244
Or you can take the deal
they've offered.
That's up to you.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.208
You have to fight this,
Christie.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.669
You can't let Jim
get away with it.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.879
I don't know, Matt.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.256
This has already gone
way beyond what
I was prepared for.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.550
I'll be there with you
every step of the way.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.760
Whatever you
and Violet need.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.928
I promise.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.394
I need time to think, okay?

11:28.521 --> 11:29.772
Thank you very much.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.692
Thanks.
Take care.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.579
So, uh, where are we going?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.749
Nowhere. We're here.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.419
You ever work on cars at all?
Me? No.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.670
Look, it doesn't matter.
All right?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.005
Just act like you're checking
on the engine.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.966
Main thing is you keep it
running and if anybody comes,
you call me, all right?

11:58.468 --> 11:59.885
Okay, no problem.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.630
Go, go, go!

12:40.802 --> 12:41.802
Go!

12:49.144 --> 12:52.020
All I'm gonna say is
that was insane.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.565
Yeah, well, there's nothing
like a divorce to make
a man act crazy.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.281
They met at the dog park.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.660
Toby! My sweet little
baby boy!

13:07.871 --> 13:08.871
How did he take it?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.956
I got the impression
he'd prefer the dog
stayed with him.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.000
Idiot. It's my dog.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.543
Personal check's okay?

13:14.836 --> 13:16.128
As long as
it doesn't bounce.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.005
Make it out to
Recovery Services Limited.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.515
Morning.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.726
Mastering the tools
of ignorance, I see.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.895
Trying to.
Practicing forcible entry.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.439
Allow me.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.570
Your average lock is
approximately waist-high.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.239
Top hand is for control.
The bottom's your fulcrum.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.365
You start full wide,

13:47.619 --> 13:50.412
you finish tight together.
Got it?

13:50.580 --> 13:51.580
Was I not doing that?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.500
The art is in the details,
Dawson. Watch.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.172
See?
Right.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.883
All right.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.140
What's up?
Herrmann is driving me crazy.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
I warned you.
I appreciate
what he's doing.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.311
But I don't think that
he understands that

14:14.395 --> 14:15.854
I've already attended
the Fire Academy.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.856
Correct me if I'm wrong,

14:17.941 --> 14:20.192
but the whole idea was
to put a little separation

14:20.276 --> 14:21.944
between you and me
at work, right?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.195
Yeah, I, I know, but I...

14:23.279 --> 14:24.613
So if you've got an issue
with Herrmann,

14:25.698 --> 14:26.698
just take it up with him.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.784
Okay.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.633
What is this,
the Gabriela Dawson
Anger Management Program?

14:47.679 --> 14:48.887
That is a yes.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.099
I got a fiancé
I can't marry.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.476
And a mentor
who's treating me
like a child.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.314
You want to
talk about it?
No, I'm good.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.863
Seven.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.783
All right, at least you're
getting it out of your system
before we hit Vegas.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.076
Tony, you're up.
Clear the table.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.244
Wait a minute.
Maybe I...

15:12.328 --> 15:15.122
Hey, don't.
Don't even think
about bailing on me.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.707
No way, dude. I'm in.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.000
All right,
you better be.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.751
That's good luck.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.670
- Here.
- Do it again.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.798
Be back in a sec.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.759
Can I please talk to you?
Just for, for two minutes.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.219
Yeah, of course.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.555
Look, I'm really sorry
to bother you.
I know that you're very busy.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.849
But I just, I don't...
I don't know where else to go.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.852
Um...

15:42.775 --> 15:45.736
I got married when I was 19
because I was pregnant.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.864
And by the time
I realized that he was
an abusive alcoholic,

15:48.948 --> 15:50.032
it was too late.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.411
Oh, and I drank, too.
I'm not gonna lie about it.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.205
We're not here
to judge you.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.916
After they took Archie,
I got clean right away.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.462
I filed a restraining
order against my ex.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.882
I proved myself to the state
and I won back custody
of my son. So...

16:09.719 --> 16:13.597
Please, if there's...
If there's any way that you
could put in a word for me...

16:14.057 --> 16:16.642
Ma'am, it's not our job to
follow up once a call is over.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.988
Wait, hold on.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.660
Shouldn't we go after her?
She just lost her kid.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.663
Look, we all get invested.

16:38.873 --> 16:39.873
But there's a line
you can't cross.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.210
Okay? Don't get involved.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.678
Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.012
612 Rex Drive.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.692
Fire department. Anyone call
for the paramedics?

17:10.071 --> 17:11.905
Thank God
you guys are here, man.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.741
Um, guy in the back,
he looks really hurt.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.368
So...

17:21.082 --> 17:23.458
It's really, really bad.
He's right back here, man.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.628
Okay. I need you to sit down
and stop moving, sir.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.974
Uh, 61 to Main.
We're gonna need
a second ambulance.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.308
Copy that, 61.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.103
Carter's not gonna die,
is he? Tell me Carter's
not going to die.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.021
I need you to take a seat,
okay? Come on.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.733
He's not breathing.
He's got a pulse,
but it's pretty slow.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.068
That sounds bad. Look, man,
I didn't mean to kill him.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.154
He said I was outta tune.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.240
And I swear, I swear
I wasn't, man.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.368
Okay. Hey, hey, buddy.
I'm gonna check you out.
Make sure everything's okay.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.786
Don't touch me, man.
Don't touch me!

17:59.871 --> 18:01.496
Just take a seat!
Calm down, okay?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.540
We need to intubate him
before he goes into
full cardiac arrest.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.708
Go ahead. Go.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.834
Oh, man.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.128
Yeah.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.845
Whoa, Daddy.
What have we got?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.613
Did you shove this
down his throat?

18:36.532 --> 18:38.366
Hey, buddy, come on.
Come on.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.370
Bastard tried to kill me
with a corn dog.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.333
What do we have this time?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.293
Band practice.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.342
That's good.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.011
Yeah.
There you go!

18:59.055 --> 19:00.931
Now what do I do?
How much are you gonna
back it up with?

19:01.390 --> 19:03.600
50 bucks?
There we go.
We're getting there, Capp.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.936
We're getting there, brother.
We're gonna clean up.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.103
Can I talk to you?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.482
I'll take a break.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.735
That sucks.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.945
What do you mean
don't get involved?

19:15.071 --> 19:17.113
It's not like they stop being
people when the call ends.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.787
Shay got overly invested with
someone she met on a call.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.580
Guy ends up
blowing his brains out.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.333
You never know
what's really going on.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.673
Well, I just treated
a meth head with a tuning fork
stuck in his eye.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.884
And even that guy
stepped up and called 911
to save his buddy.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.559
You quit giving somebody
a second chance,
they stop having one.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.978
I need your help on this.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.447
Mind if we come in?

20:00.783 --> 20:01.783
Sure.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.744
Just wanna ask you
a few questions.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.455
About what?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.711
What was Archie doing
on the balcony alone?

20:15.673 --> 20:18.174
He was spying on
the apartment below ours.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.385
Why didn't you
just say that?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.470
You have kids?
Mmm-mmm.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.059
My mom used to take
my brother and me to
the bar with her. O'Henry's.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.521
When she'd get liquored up,
she'd shame us in front of
whoever was there.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.565
I swore I would never
let that happen to my kid.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.567
Not ever.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.819
You've been sober
for a while, right?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.363
Two years, three months.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.574
Do you have a chip
by any chance?

20:50.374 --> 20:53.418
And your sponsor,
when was the last time
you spoke to him?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.669
It's a woman.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.343
Fifteen minutes ago.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.432
You mentioned a restraining
order against your ex.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.934
Yeah.
You got a copy?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.533
You mind if I take
a look in your fridge?

21:28.871 --> 21:29.871
Go on.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.178
They're organic.

21:46.347 --> 21:47.347
I feed Archie right.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.142
Which isn't easy to do
on 11 bucks an hour
at a nail salon.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.022
You have any other questions?

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
Thank you.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.780
We just needed to know
who we were going to bat for.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.914
Let's go! Go!

22:14.792 --> 22:17.419
One way is life.
The other way's death.
Make a decision.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.962
Make a decision!

22:21.882 --> 22:23.258
Get down! Lower down!

22:23.676 --> 22:25.051
Let's go! Get down lower.

22:25.219 --> 22:29.931
It's flashing over. Ten.
Nine, eight, seven. All right.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.226
Listen, you're badly burned,
but you're probably
still alive.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.937
I know.
You spent too much time
reading the coupling.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.772
Give me your hand.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.275
Smooth butt,
that's the female.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.277
That's the way
I'm gonna go.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.237
Flip it around,

22:44.697 --> 22:45.697
big nuts!

22:46.741 --> 22:49.200
Uh-uh. Christopher Herrmann
don't go that way. Get it?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.163
Permission to speak?
Permission granted.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.209
I know I asked for this,
and I know you're just
trying to help,

22:58.294 --> 22:59.335
but I already did
all this...

22:59.420 --> 23:01.212
Yeah, this isn't
the Academy, Dawson.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.547
What you're doing
here and now,

23:02.715 --> 23:04.883
this is the Christopher
Herrmann School
of Firefighting.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.885
Learned from a lifetime
on the job.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.055
I appreciate that.
And I will do whatever
you say, Herrmann.

23:10.139 --> 23:13.933
All I'm asking is that
when we're on calls,
you let me do my job.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.480
All right. I will.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.232
Thank you.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.527
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

23:24.862 --> 23:27.030
You're not done.
You gotta finish
these drills, Candidate.

23:27.990 --> 23:31.493
Helmet on! Let's go.
We don't stop till
we can't get it wrong.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.581
Hey, you guys okay?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.916
Hi, Uncle Matt.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.085
Sorry to bother you.
You're not. What's going on?

23:40.377 --> 23:41.836
I'm on my way to take
the teacher's test,

23:41.921 --> 23:43.379
you know,
to get recertified,

23:43.464 --> 23:44.464
and I couldn't
get a sitter.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.218
Is there any way I can
drop off Violet for, like,
an hour? Two tops?

23:48.302 --> 23:50.220
Yeah, of course.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.596
Want to say hi to Pouch?
Sure.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.014
All right.
I'll meet you inside.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.020
So, um, what do you want me
to do about Bankhead?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.438
The divorce attorney?
Yeah.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.024
I'm not doing that, Matt.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.151
I'm gonna take
the settlement offer.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.907
All right. Good luck
on the test.

24:11.867 --> 24:12.867
Thanks.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.376
We miss you, Violet!
We miss you!

24:22.711 --> 24:23.711
What're you watching?

24:24.797 --> 24:27.257
My friends at
the Latin School sent
me a Vine.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.802
Hey.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.516
You okay?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.145
I miss my house.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.063
And my school.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.442
I don't know why my dad's
doing this to us.
I don't know what I did.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.735
Hey, hey, hey.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.321
It's not your fault.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.658
It's gonna be okay.

24:56.871 --> 24:57.871
I promised.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.426
I'll be right back.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.725
What?
I need more information.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.768
There's gotta be
something else.
On your brother-in-law?

25:21.228 --> 25:24.022
I thought Ruzek gave you
what you needed.
Not him. The mistress.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.817
You dig deep enough,

25:27.902 --> 25:30.445
sooner or later,
you are gonna find a body.

25:30.821 --> 25:31.946
Then what?

25:32.323 --> 25:33.656
Just do whatever it takes.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.327
Okay.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.424
Hi there.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.094
What's this,
a fire drill?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.389
Kelly Severide.
I'm a lieutenant
with Squad 3.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.641
This is Sylvie Brett.
Paramedic.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.101
We appreciate you taking
a moment out of your busy day.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.561
Yeah? What can I do for ya?

26:03.687 --> 26:05.438
Reason we're here is
a mistake was made.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.565
And because of that a mother
and son have been split up.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.567
What's the name?
Keating.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.819
The mother's name is Katharyn.
Her son is Archie.

26:12.238 --> 26:16.324
I inherited
26 new files since
Moira went on maternity leave.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.493
Keating, Keating...

26:19.495 --> 26:21.454
Is that with an "A"
or couple of "E's"?

26:22.039 --> 26:23.164
"E-A."
Got it.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.585
As firefighters, your word
carries a lot of weight
around here. Lot of weight.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.170
Rest assured I'll get to it
as soon as I get a minute.

26:30.798 --> 26:31.798
Okay, well...

26:34.093 --> 26:36.052
There's a number on here
when you do. It's important.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.637
Every single one of them's
important.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.056
Especially for the guy
whose name's on the folder.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.308
Well, I look forward
to your call.

27:00.995 --> 27:03.913
For real?
Madmen and fools are in
the game for thrills.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.916
But wise men,
we're all about the money.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.169
Yo, you got my number,
anytime you need me.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.715
Uh, what exactly
are the requirements

27:13.841 --> 27:15.675
for participating in
such a venture?

27:16.218 --> 27:18.344
Oh, look, I can't use
anybody with an eye issue.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.681
Well, I'm available.
So consider me in
the on-deck circle.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.809
I've made a full recovery.
Clean bill of health.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.686
Look, well, I will keep
y'all in mind.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.441
Yeah.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.237
Curls suit you, girl.
Oh!

27:36.947 --> 27:38.197
This is my
wash-and-wear hair.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.241
Didn't have time to
straighten it this morning.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.243
It looks good.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.829
Stop.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.748
Okay, uh,
fax come in for me?

27:47.416 --> 27:49.625
Alabama PD?
Um, let's see.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.300
'Sup?

27:58.594 --> 27:59.594
Got something for you.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.071
We need to talk.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.865
If you'll excuse me.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.537
Anything you have to say can
be directed to my attorney.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.705
Four years ago,

28:29.375 --> 28:33.586
your little mistress
married a man from
Montgomery, Alabama.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.254
Faked his will.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.965
When the kids sued,
she split.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.594
That's a bench warrant
for her arrest.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.888
You're welcome
to keep that copy.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.685
I drop a dime,
she's gone.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.398
And given that your assets
are in her name,

28:53.482 --> 28:54.690
the money's gone, too.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.985
I'm sure you'll do
what's right.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.822
For your daughter.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.704
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61.
- Assist the police.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.456
5737 Chase Avenue.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.713
Hold it there.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.966
CPD executing
a search warrant.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.592
May need some help with
a forcible entry.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.679
Hey. Sergeant Conroy.
Thanks for coming, Chief.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.722
Wallace Boden.
How can I help you, Sergeant?

29:27.015 --> 29:30.518
Well, we got a known drug
dealer with an outstanding
warrant holed up inside.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.895
And he may be armed,
so need you to keep
your guys back

29:33.105 --> 29:34.480
till we get the area secure.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.524
Once it's safe,
we could use
some help getting in.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.942
Window or door?

29:38.193 --> 29:40.027
There's a second story window
in the back that might work,

29:40.112 --> 29:41.696
but we'd prefer to make
entry through the front.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.197
Thing is,
it's heavily fortified.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.740
Steel security door?

29:44.867 --> 29:46.868
Yeah, with a heavy-grated
steel entry door behind it.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.786
I'll take two guys
and a ladder to the rear.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.538
You take the entry.
You got it.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.708
Otis, Mouch,
grab the 20-foot ladder
and go with the Chief.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.168
Cruz, get a chain ready.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.462
Herrmann and Dawson,
grab a set of irons

29:57.546 --> 29:58.963
and have a jack plate
standing by.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.733
Okay, Cruz.
Take out the slack.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.576
Go for it.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.250
Herrmann, Dawson. Go.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.543
All right, let's go.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.589
All right.
Just like the sledge.

30:42.799 --> 30:43.841
Strike!

30:43.926 --> 30:46.052
Strike, strike!
Good.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.891
All right, one more time.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.436
Strike, strike, strike!

30:55.521 --> 30:56.729
Strike, strike!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.069
Get down!
Everybody down!

31:05.781 --> 31:07.281
Shots fired.
Shots fired.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.574
Central, be advised.

31:08.659 --> 31:11.619
We've got multiple
gunshots fired at the
Chase Avenue location.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.121
Put the gun down!

31:17.125 --> 31:19.627
Copy that.
Routing additional units
to your location.

31:25.676 --> 31:26.759
Dawson, now!

31:33.642 --> 31:35.142
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:36.186 --> 31:37.395
Police! Search warrant!

31:37.771 --> 31:39.397
Get on the ground!
Nobody move!

31:45.821 --> 31:46.821
We're clear.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.406
Clear!
Clear up!

31:52.953 --> 31:55.496
Any of you guys paramedics?
We got a wounded hostage
in here.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.000
Mills, need the backboard!

31:59.835 --> 32:02.545
Hey. Hey, hey, we got you.
You're in good hands.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.338
Now help me out
and hang in there, okay?

32:08.635 --> 32:10.428
Uh, I think it hit her lung.
She's starting to bleed out.

32:11.555 --> 32:12.763
Thanks. I got her, Dawson.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.059
Here, I got it.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.442
Okay.

32:27.863 --> 32:28.946
You see that cut,
Lieutenant?

32:29.031 --> 32:30.281
Damn straight
I saw it.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.907
Boom!

32:35.954 --> 32:38.873
Gunshot to the chest.
Pressure 80 palp.
O2 sat's in the 70s.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.335
Get her into Trauma 1.
Call CT and somebody
get Respiratory.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.604
She didn't make it?
No.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.692
That was such a good save
for Dawson.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.195
I just really wanted
her to make it.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.113
You got her here alive.
That's the job.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.366
Doesn't really count,
though, does it?

33:13.617 --> 33:15.618
You did everything
you could, right?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.332
I need to make a stop
on the way back.

33:23.960 --> 33:24.960
Okay.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.181
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
We both work for the city,

33:37.307 --> 33:39.934
so can I toss you
a bone because this is
personal for you.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.894
Personal for me?

33:41.978 --> 33:44.855
No, no, no, this is personal
for a little boy and his mom

33:44.940 --> 33:47.566
who've been put through hell
because the system,
meaning you,

33:47.651 --> 33:49.610
is too jammed up
to give a damn about them.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.030
You have the power
to make a difference.

33:53.115 --> 33:55.491
And you are going to
make that difference

33:55.575 --> 33:58.619
by taking their folder
off the bottom of your pile

33:58.704 --> 33:59.912
and putting it on top.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.040
And I'm not leaving
until you do.

34:07.713 --> 34:08.713
Yeah.

34:18.348 --> 34:21.434
This will last me
at least five hours.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.374
Hey! You ready?

34:48.003 --> 34:50.671
Don't say it.
Don't even say it.
You're gonna kill me.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.214
I knew you were
gonna do this.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.801
Uh, I promised my mom.
She's having a blowout
garage sale...

34:55.886 --> 34:57.052
I don't want
to hear about it.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.388
I can't make Vegas.
Seriously, Capp,
I don't want to hear about it.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.101
Lieutenant Severide?

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
Hey.
Hey.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.273
They're bringing Archie
back home this afternoon.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.776
I don't even know how to
begin to say thank you.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.277
Well,

35:14.154 --> 35:15.446
she's the one who
deserves the credit.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.036
Thank you.
Aww.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.583
Thank you. Thank you.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.465
Hey,

35:35.175 --> 35:36.467
do you want to go
to Vegas with me?

35:39.805 --> 35:41.388
When?
Seriously, right now.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.141
Um...

35:45.393 --> 35:46.393
It'll be fun.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.645
I...

35:48.396 --> 35:50.731
I, I'd love to. Uh...

35:52.234 --> 35:54.693
I'm not sure how great of
an idea that is, though.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.154
That's okay,
no sweat.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.574
Hey.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.285
Thanks.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.294
You did good
out there, Dawson.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.840
Thanks, Herrmann.
I had a helluva coach.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.383
I mean it.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.677
You proved yourself.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.346
Hope this doesn't mean
you're gonna quit
breaking my balls, huh?

36:31.064 --> 36:32.940
It's my job
as an old firefighter

36:33.066 --> 36:36.110
to teach the young
firefighters how to
become old ones.

36:47.247 --> 36:48.289
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.418
Well, if you'll excuse me,
it appears that the Lieutenant

36:52.502 --> 36:55.421
would like to have a word
with his candidate.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.298
Thanks, Herrmann.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.137
I gotta check in
on Violet and Christie.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.972
Can I come with you?

37:05.682 --> 37:08.517
As your fiancé,
I'd appreciate that.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.275
- Hello?
- Be right down!

37:22.198 --> 37:24.658
Hey. Good to see you, Gabby.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.746
You will never believe it.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.414
What?
Jim came by.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.710
And?
He's doubling
the child support payments,

37:35.253 --> 37:37.463
covering Violet's tuition
at the Latin School,

37:37.839 --> 37:39.840
and he took the house
off the market.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.425
We move back in
this weekend.

37:44.346 --> 37:45.346
That's great.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.597
He's not
a bad man, Matt.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.057
I told you,
he has a good heart.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.143
Yeah.
Congratulations.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.937
Violet must be happy.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.229
She's waiting for you
to tuck her in.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.611
Hey, Matt.
Mmm-hmm?

38:01.905 --> 38:05.908
Is there something... I mean,
did you do anything to make it
turn out like this?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.207
Violet?

38:13.917 --> 38:15.042
Hi.
Hey.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.212
We're moving back to
our old house. And I'm going
back to my old school.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.964
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I'm so happy.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.675
Yeah. Your mom is, too.
I know.

38:23.176 --> 38:24.343
Come on,
I'll tuck you in.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.057
I knew you'd fix it,
Uncle Matt.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.476
Turned out okay, huh?

38:33.228 --> 38:34.395
Yeah.

38:35.605 --> 38:36.605
Muah!

38:38.566 --> 38:40.067
You know I'll always be
there for you.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.325
Turn the iPad off, baby girl.
It's time for bed.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.412
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.916
Look, I left my phone
in the car. Bed.
Okay.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.982
Yeah, you can find me.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.276
But I know
where to find you.

39:31.828 --> 39:32.828
Seven out.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.133
Hey.
Hey.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.219
You play craps at all?

39:49.304 --> 39:51.138
Nope.
Good luck.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.767
Hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, come back.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.436
Come on.
New girl luck.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.645
It works every time.
Please?

40:00.523 --> 40:01.815
New girl luck?

40:02.650 --> 40:03.692
Come on.

40:06.029 --> 40:07.154
Place your bets.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.325
You're the shooter.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.204
Just aim
for the back wall.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.709
Eight easy.
There you go.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.422
Okay. What are we going
for this time?
Another eight.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.100
Eight, hard.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.310
I got it!

40:39.896 --> 40:41.021
Hey!
