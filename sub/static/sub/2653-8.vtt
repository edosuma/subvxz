WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.180
How the hell
did they lose our reservation?

00:04.238 --> 00:07.412
Dad, you were married to Mom for 30 years.
What's another couple nights on a couch?

00:07.475 --> 00:11.389
I'm gonna call for the cot, and I'm gonna
try to squeeze 'em on that 9.95 Wi-Fi fee.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.049
They're selling air.

00:13.114 --> 00:17.722
ClosetCon is the premier North American
trade show for the closet industry.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.790
I stopped going years ago 'cause
it's a trade show for the closet industry.

00:21.856 --> 00:22.960
Thank you.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.833
This schedule is incredible.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.736
Dad, there's a 10:45 session
on sustainable materials.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.741
We have got to hit that.

00:29.797 --> 00:33.006
Mmm, but it overlaps with
00 a. m. panel on paneling.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.911
And a breakout session on shoe storage.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.416
The convention floor is for suckers.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.008
All work is done at the bar.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.747
Unless Tony G. and Layla
are singing standards...

00:41.809 --> 00:44.449
in which case, no work-
prepare to be entertained.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.152
Dad, I came here to learn,
not sit in the bar and drink.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.057
You do what you want.
I'm getting a scotch.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.324
Well, I do need to meet everybody.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.533
Ooh, good. Breakfast.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.296
Breakfast? Try lunch.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.531
- We wake up early on the farm.
- Sure do.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.836
There's our sleepy city mouse.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.741
- Let's get you all squared away here.
- Yeah, I got it.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.370
- Down here.
- Down here?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.779
I forgot how much work there was
to be done around here.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.510
I've been mendin' fence all mornin'.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.518
Been mendin', have you?

01:13.574 --> 01:17.386
Missouri. Misery. Huh.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.058
- What a pigsty, huh?
- Cute.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.324
Daddy went to town. He's gonna be there
till supper, so I'm helpin' Mama slop the pigs.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.830
You wanna pitch in?

01:25.886 --> 01:29.629
I don't know. I just ate that bacon,
so how's that gonna look?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.829
Wanna ring the dinner bell, lil bomber?

01:31.892 --> 01:34.702
That's actually really quaint.
Is it one of those little triangles-

01:34.762 --> 01:37.436
Sooey!

01:37.932 --> 01:39.502
Hoo!

01:42.203 --> 01:45.707
Loudest call in the tri-county area.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.310
- Do it again!
- No, sweetheart. I think once was enough.

01:48.375 --> 01:52.414
Sooey!

01:52.480 --> 01:55.757
Wow! There's actually an animal
that runs toward that sound, huh?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.562
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:59.620 --> 02:01.657
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:01.722 --> 02:03.759
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:03.824 --> 02:05.735
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:05.793 --> 02:07.033
♪ Hey,♪♪

02:10.064 --> 02:11.873
- Hey!
- Hello, hello!

02:11.932 --> 02:14.412
- Did you make the reservation?
- Yeah, 7:00.

02:16.370 --> 02:20.318
Fun family time with this little newsie
and a steak dinner?

02:20.374 --> 02:23.150
Who says people at the closet convention
get all the fun?

02:23.210 --> 02:25.019
No one. No one says that.

02:25.079 --> 02:28.424
I am telling you. The way he looked at me
when I came to the door, it is so on.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.224
Kind of seemed like he was just delivering
pizza, and you were giving him money.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.423
What are you guys talking about?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.056
Chuck, the pizza guy from last night.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.897
He's shy and thoughtful
and wears a Princeton sweatshirt.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.631
- Hardly Haley's type.
- Oh, my God. You love him.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.402
What? No, I- How would you say I love him?
He's been to our house exactly three times.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.411
- That's ridiculous, Haley. Don't even look at me.
- This is so stupid.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.105
She loves him.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.376
Hey, Manimal. How was picture day?

02:50.437 --> 02:53.441
You know what's super helpful? When the guy
in line behind you calls you Mt. Sweatmore.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.817
- I was trying to relax you.
- Hey.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.753
It was right in front of you-
Brad Pit Stains.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.722
- Come on, Luke.
- It's okay.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.487
Whoa. New security system?

03:01.549 --> 03:04.723
You can see the backyard,
the front door, the garage- everywhere.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.423
Yeah. Can't take any chances...

03:06.487 --> 03:09.400
since Mom gave birth
to the Hope Diamond over there.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.329
There is a room off the kitchen
at Jay's house that's always locked.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.000
I try it every time I'm there.

03:17.064 --> 03:22.241
I've spent countless hours imagining
that that room is a house of treasure...

03:22.303 --> 03:25.284
a palace of ceaseless wonder.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.376
It's real.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.211
Hello, old friend.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.816
Would you look at that?

03:33.881 --> 03:37.454
What? That's coconuts!

03:37.518 --> 03:40.089
No!

03:40.154 --> 03:43.931
- Whoa. Is that-
- A replica of Apollo 13.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.732
Look at the detail.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.002
You can almost see
the astronauts drinking teeny-tiny Tang.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.133
- Can I hold it?
- No.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.972
You have any idea how valuable this is?

03:52.032 --> 03:53.534
And your fingers are covered
in cheese dust.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.274
There.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.838
- No! Luke, wait!
- Hey guys, knock it off.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.975
Whoa-ho!

03:59.039 --> 04:00.643
Don't worry, Gloria. I got it.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.513
- Dios mío.
- Nobody panic!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.682
This is a collector's edition.
It's 40 years old!

04:05.746 --> 04:09.785
We're gonna have to improvise.
Gloria, call the steak house and cancel.

04:09.850 --> 04:14.230
Um- Manny, find some glue.
Luke, let's get these parts into the garage.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.825
I know this seems impossible,
but we can do this!

04:16.890 --> 04:20.132
Hello, Houston's? We have a situation.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.074
Hi. We're with ClosetCon. All access.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.132
She doesn't care.
You're the only dope wearing that here.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.736
- Give it to me.
- No. I like it.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.680
Hey, Joel! Looking good, my friend.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.218
Took a bath on automated closets.
People aren't ready for that.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.483
Jay Pritchett!
Get your cute butt over here.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.079
- Who's that?
- An old friend.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.386
I'm gonna go say hello.
Why don't you get us a couple drinks?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.154
Yeah. I'll do that.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.895
Hi. Can I get a scotch and a white wine?
Wow. Rowdy crowd, huh?

04:47.955 --> 04:50.265
Trade shows. People get away from
their families, get a little liquored up.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.201
- Yeah, I get that.
- Let's just say...

04:52.259 --> 04:54.170
when the name tags go on,
the wedding rings come off.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.674
I am not so on board with that.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.836
- Hey there.
- Classy.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.540
Oh, you look so good!

05:05.806 --> 05:08.946
My mom was pretty self-involved,
and my dad traveled a lot for work.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.456
So yeah, I did wonder if- You know?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.652
Not that I could blame him.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.992
My friend Alison's mom greeted her
every day after school...

05:18.052 --> 05:19.895
with a big hug and a giant smile.

05:19.953 --> 05:24.026
And I always thought,
"Yeah. Wouldn't mind a piece of that."

05:24.091 --> 05:27.470
- So are we doing this?
- I'll bring it to your room this afternoon.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.670
We have a little tradition at ClosetCon
for rookies, which Claire is this year.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.975
We take a skeleton.
We hide it in their closet.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.812
They open the door and scream,
and we all have a good laugh.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.374
Can't take full credit for the idea.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.421
We stole it from CabinetCon.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.149
Hot cider!

05:44.211 --> 05:46.817
Oh, yes! Thank you, Barb.
Thank you so much.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.292
- It's chilly.
- Mmm. Wow, that's got a kick.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.795
- That'd be the rum.
- Ah.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.024
I can feel it warming up your belly.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.623
Eh, still in my mouth and throat.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.498
- Well, what's that?
- Boy, it's starting to get nippy, huh?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.128
You guys wanna walk down to the duck pond?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.139
That sounds lovely. I'll get the gun.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.833
Are y'all comin'?

06:02.896 --> 06:06.503
- Y'all? We don't say "y'all."
- Yeah, we do.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.104
Well, yeah, we say it here,
but not normally.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.115
Well, did you ever think
this is how I really talk...

06:11.171 --> 06:13.481
and that I talk "different-like"
when I'm not here?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.213
- Y'all fightin'?
- No, no, sweetie.

06:15.275 --> 06:18.085
We're just having a conversation
about how your daddy can be so stuck up.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.285
use our daughter to get your little digs in.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.850
I would never do that, sweetie.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.590
You don't think I notice how condescending
you are when we come here?

06:25.652 --> 06:28.656
You just set on the porch, you roll your eyes,
don't participate in anything.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.293
And yeah, I said "set."
But that's how we talk here.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.133
I'm from this place.
I'm proud of this place.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.037
And it hurts me that the man I love
just thinks it's some big joke.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.905
Come on, sweetie.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.036
Lord-a-mercy.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.516
I'm starving.
What are we gonna do about dinner?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.144
I checked with Dad,
and I ordered a couple pizzas from Theo's.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.450
I knew it! You're stalking my pizza guy!

06:51.512 --> 06:53.014
He is not into you, okay?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.617
Does he call you Brown Eyes
and give you extra mozzarella sticks?

06:55.682 --> 07:00.097
Okay. That's it, you two. You cannot fight
over men like it's jewelry or shoes.

07:00.154 --> 07:02.634
If you're both interested,
no one makes a move.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.794
Sisters before misters!

07:07.194 --> 07:08.468
- Stalker!
- Trollop.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.167
Ha, ha. Don't know what it means.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.232
Ow! What did you do?

07:12.299 --> 07:14.074
- Nothing!
- Yes, you did!

07:14.134 --> 07:16.011
You turned it on,
and now the propeller's all tangled up.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.071
- Why would I do that?
- 'Cause my pizza guy is coming...

07:18.138 --> 07:19.640
and now I have airplane in my hair!

07:19.706 --> 07:21.549
I swear I didn't, Haley.
Okay. I'll get it out.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.985
Oh, my God. Ow!

07:23.043 --> 07:24.716
- What is happening?
- I don't know!

07:24.778 --> 07:29.488
Oh! You find a little toy?

07:29.550 --> 07:32.554
Hey. Was that Aunt Marge
just tearin' down the driveway?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.099
Yes, and she dropped off a little present.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.034
Is that my Cam-Cam?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.264
- Gram-Gram!
- Oh, you.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.934
There have been some storm warnings,
so Marge thought she'd be safer over here.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.672
But she dropped her off so fast that
we didn't even have a chance to straighten up.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.735
Oh.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.304
We never told Gram about the gay.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.872
You know, after they reach
a certain age...

07:51.939 --> 07:54.283
you worry that it could be
the thing that sends 'em over the edge.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.844
And she's been on the edge
for a long time.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.947
We're actually on deathbed number two.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.889
Mitchell! Mitchell.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.086
Okay. What-What's this?

08:02.149 --> 08:05.187
This is me ready to slop,
bale or milk somethin'.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.732
- You don't need to do that.
- No, I- Cam, I know. I know.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.962
I gave you hell for being who you really are,
and I wanna make that up to you.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.267
But you know what? Putting on
my sister's Sunday overalls is gesture enough.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.103
- What's this?
- Oh, it's my chewin' straw.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.143
- It's not straw.
- Oh, it's just show.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.404
- For show!
- Wait. Come on.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.377
You love the man,
you love the world he comes from.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.972
- But you know what-
- I don't know if it's these farmin' clothes or what...

08:24.037 --> 08:27.382
- but I am feeling so close to you right now.
- That's so sweet.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.250
- Gimme a kiss.
- No, not right now.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.913
Well, don't make me wrassle you down.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.150
Stop.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.653
- Who's this?
- Oh, dear.

08:34.715 --> 08:39.061
Uh- Well, Grams, this is Bud,
our new farmhand.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.621
- Bud?
- Yeah.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.793
Bud's a little simpleminded
on account of gettin' mule kicked.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.133
Isn't he? And you know the rules
on bein' in the house, Bud.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.970
Now go on outside.
We're gonna milk the cows in a few minutes.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.670
Get on out there. Have a treat afterwards.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.882
- Here's what we've got to work with.
- Nicely done.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.439
I've got Florida on the line.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.746
Dad, I'm flying you in.
You're the model expert.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.686
What are we looking at, Son?

09:03.744 --> 09:07.521
Holy Moses. More like Apollo 1300pieces!

09:07.581 --> 09:11.324
Oof. In space, I guess no one
can hear you be hilarious.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.194
- I need you to focus.
- If Jay sees this-

09:13.253 --> 09:16.097
I know. Dad, you got three good men
here depending on you.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.863
Say no more. I'm gonna tap a button now..

09:17.925 --> 09:20.030
That's either gonna make you
larger on my screen or-

09:22.195 --> 09:23.697
We've lost Florida.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.869
Yeah. Bring the skeleton up now.
I just got to the room.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.537
Hey, Dad.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.844
Hey, honey. I thought we were meeting
at the restaurant.

09:30.904 --> 09:35.375
Well, the lecture got done a little early,
and I was kind of the star of the evening.

09:35.442 --> 09:40.585
I got a huge laugh when I coined
the phrase "shelf-esteem." Huh?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.820
Yeah? Okay, I'll text it to Phil.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.227
Why don't you go down to the lobby?
You'll get a stronger signal.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.525
- Oh. Hello.
- Rita.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.294
- This is my daughter, Claire.
- Hi.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.234
- Claire, this is Rita.
- Your dad and I go way back.

09:51.291 --> 09:55.671
First time we met, I told him he needed
a course in hanger management.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.675
it's still funny.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.108
Seriously?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.510
Her husband's in the garment business.
He made me a suit.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.549
- I make the closets, and he fills 'em.
- Match made in heaven.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.551
Honey, they're kind of sticklers
at that restaurant.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.951
Why don't you grab our table?
I'll put this in the room.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.989
Uh, okay. Will do.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.355
Um, really nice to meet you.
See you downstairs.

10:14.414 --> 10:18.487
I actually am gonna take the stairs.
That elevator's slow.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.193
Hey, was it just me, or was she lookin' at me weird?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.533
- I did kind of sense that.
- You don't think she knows about our deal?

10:26.593 --> 10:28.231
How could she? it was 20 years ago.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.605
And I never told anyone.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.570
Would she even care?

10:36.637 --> 10:39.277
That I tried to get rid of the man
she ended up marrying?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.410
Well, it's not like
you took a hit out on him.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.217
You had me offer him a job
in the greatest state in the union.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.278
Okay, Tex.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.720
If I never said anything,
how could she know?

10:50.784 --> 10:54.322
You're not the first one I approached.
You're just the first one who said yes.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.298
I'm done. I am done.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.432
Come on. Please. Just be Bud.
For a couple days.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.637
You can do some chores.
Maybe I can berate you a bit to really sell it.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.442
Do you hear how insane you sound?
Chores?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.575
You know what? Deal with your grandmother however you want.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.949
- Lily and I will just go get a hotel room.
- No, you can't.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.919
Fine. Motel. Silo.
Whatever you got around here.

11:16.977 --> 11:20.117
No, that alarm means
there's a tornado coming right now.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.093
God. Well, where's Lily?
I hope she's not still out in the field.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.823
Lily!

11:24.885 --> 11:29.732
- You can't just call her like a pig.
- Lily!

11:29.790 --> 11:32.066
This is just a farm thing,
not, like, a mall thing.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.935
- What's that, city voice? Mmm?
- Just go.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.203
This is really in there good.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.474
Get her off of me!
I'm getting dumb through osmosis.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.846
I don't have osmosis.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.112
Oh, great. Chuck's here with the pizza.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.176
- Gloria, can you please get it?
- No.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.018
You two be nice to each other
and figure it out.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.081
Ow! Ow!

11:55.482 --> 11:58.122
Oh, hey, Chuck.
I didn't think you'd be working tonight.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.665
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- Oh, this is my grandfather's house.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.564
There's a pool. Do you swim?
You look like you swim.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.967
- I do.
- Oh, thanks.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.700
Oh.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.639
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.335
Just a cramp. I work out. One second.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.809
- You little-
- Dude. Shut up.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.276
- Hey, you!
- Hey, Brown Eyes.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.819
- Ow!
- Uh-

12:21.875 --> 12:25.254
- Here. All right.
- Okay, cool. Thanks. Bye!

12:26.913 --> 12:29.826
- Bye!
- No! Shut the door!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.521
Don't be nervous, honey.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.121
There's nothing to be scared of.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.167
- Take it easy, Mama. Don't break a hip.
- I am telling you.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.067
I am not pretending to be something I'm not,
especially in front of our daughter.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.335
Oh, so I can't kiss you
in front of your dad for six years?

12:42.395 --> 12:46.866
And you can't give me two days? We're saving
an old lady some unnecessary upset.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.244
Why don't you give her a little credit? She
might be more open-minded than you think.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.716
Well, you're a cute little Chinese thing.

12:53.774 --> 12:57.551
Actually, Grams, she's, uh, from Vietnam.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.557
And her name's Lily.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.923
Dad, how long do I have to stay down here?

13:01.982 --> 13:02.983
Dad?

13:04.251 --> 13:06.231
Okay. Well, I guess
there's no way around this.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.563
Actually, ma'am, she's my kin.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.399
So you got a Chinese wife, Bud?

13:12.459 --> 13:16.601
No, I-I went to Vietnam,
and I did myself some adoptin'.

13:16.663 --> 13:21.043
And now I'm raisin' her,
all by my lonesome.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.514
Well, I never thought
I'd live long enough to see that!

13:24.571 --> 13:26.346
None of us did.

13:26.406 --> 13:31.412
But I guess there's nothing more important
than family, no matter how they come.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.719
Well, that is mighty open-minded of you.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.282
Some folks 'round these parts...

13:35.348 --> 13:39.023
don't share that progressive-
I say, progressive- sensibility.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.587
To each his own.

13:40.654 --> 13:45.967
But I do wish I had another
little one like that to spoil.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.607
What if I told you
you did have a great-grandbaby?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.610
- What?
- Cam.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.577
It's okay, Mama.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.376
What if I told you I was in love...

13:57.437 --> 14:00.850
and that I've never been
happier in my entire life...

14:00.907 --> 14:02.614
and that I'm about to get married?

14:02.676 --> 14:05.316
I can't think of anything better!

14:05.378 --> 14:08.518
And what if I told you
the love of my life...

14:08.582 --> 14:11.495
is this man standing right here?

14:11.551 --> 14:14.555
Then I'd know
why God sent us this tornado.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.468
After the initial shock,
Grams softened a bit.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.232
She even agreed to attend the wedding.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.897
Standing outside with a sign.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.738
Baby steps, Mitchell. Baby steps.

14:24.798 --> 14:29.076
And... our antenna is...

14:29.135 --> 14:30.136
reattached!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.648
Yes! Ha!

14:31.705 --> 14:33.207
Oh, this is useless.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.719
Hey! I don't wanna hear talk like that.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.381
If you want inspiration,
think about Apollo 13.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.618
Jay didn't give up
when he first put together this model.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.421
It was hard and complicated...

14:42.482 --> 14:45.952
and back then the print on the instructions
was tiny, but he persevered.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.625
Also, the astronauts
on the actual Apollo 13 didn't give up...

14:48.688 --> 14:50.463
when their actual lives were in danger.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.766
Them too, but they had a lot of other people
helping them out. We're on our own here.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.933
Ok.ay. I figured out what we need
to reattach that damn landing module.

14:56.997 --> 15:02.071
Glue won't work We needa very thin filament,
thinner than thread

15:02.135 --> 15:04.012
I know what would work.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.976
Well, I need to go check. on something

15:07.040 --> 15:09.782
I told my date I'd be back in a jiff.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.186
Back in a jiff.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.451
Nothing to do but wait.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.823
Why are we making ourselves crazy, Phil?

15:15.882 --> 15:18.863
I don't know.
I just hate disappointing Jay so much.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.660
He is not an easy guy to please.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.293
- I know. But when you do, it's pretty sweet, ain't it?
- Sure is.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.837
You're lucky to have a dad like that.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.204
Hard not to be hurt by that, Son.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.907
How have I never noticed
how loud you breathe?

15:33.967 --> 15:36.880
Aw, don't beat yourself up. That'd require you
to notice something that isn't about you.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.382
Oh, my God. You are such a loser!

15:38.438 --> 15:41.885
Okay! That's it!
I cannot listen to this anymore!

15:41.942 --> 15:44.548
I'm going to cut you two out of that plane.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.488
Too late!

15:46.546 --> 15:48.719
- Okay, okay! Just cut mine.
- Yeah, cut hers.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.252
- Wait, why?
- No one cares what I look like anyway.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.856
- You don't really think that.
- Yeah, well, kind of.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.026
You didn't see the way
that Chuck was looking at you?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.696
Wait. You actually think I'm a threat?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.932
I'm not gonna say that out loud.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.997
Aw, that's so sweet.

16:04.064 --> 16:07.409
Well, if I ever had a boyfriend,
I wouldn't trust him with you for five seconds.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.105
Aw!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.843
- Okay, let's finish this job-
- Gloria, no!

16:11.905 --> 16:13.248
- Wait!
- There you go.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.377
That's it. That was easy.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.353
Why did you wait an hour to do this?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.287
Why did you wait 15 years to do that?

16:19.346 --> 16:22.088
At least this way, nothing bad happened
to anyone's pretty hair.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.094
¡Ay.!

16:28.621 --> 16:31.192
- Oh, honey. I didn't hear you come in.
- Mmm.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.930
How was the rest of your night?

16:32.993 --> 16:37.305
Let's see. After you bailed on me,
Mark from Closetopia yakked my ear off...

16:37.364 --> 16:41.312
and then told me I looked like Heidi Klum,
which is such an obvious come-on.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.281
- Mark's gay.
- Well, in that case, my night stank.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.214
And I didn't bail.
I know a lot of people here.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.081
- They pulled me away.
- Hmm.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.712
Hey, these robes are terrific.
You know, there's one for you in the closet.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.950
- You oughta put it on.
- I don't want a robe.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.152
Dad, were you avoiding me tonight?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.717
Why would I avoid you?

16:56.783 --> 16:59.821
Trust me. Soft, like butter.
Right in there.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.490
Don't make me ask.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.192
What are you talking about?

17:03.256 --> 17:07.170
You and Rita, 20 years ago.
It's okay, I know.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.265
- Aw, geez.
- I get it. Things happen.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.138
- Really?
- It was a long time ago.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.509
Well, I appreciate it.
I just wanna say, I'm not proud of it.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.777
If I had known him then
like I know him now...

17:18.838 --> 17:21.284
I never would've tried to get rid of Phil.
Good night.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.251
Get rid of Phil?
What are you talking about?

17:28.314 --> 17:30.692
- What are you talking about?
- You and Rita had an affair.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.357
No, we didn't. That's crazy!
Well, okay. Good night.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.265
- Get rid of Phil- What does that even mean?
- Doesn't mean anything.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.736
You had just started dating.
You know I was never hot on the guy.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.206
I told Rita to offer him
a sales job in Texas.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.437
I remember that, but that wasn't
when we were dating. We were engaged.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.002
Doesn't matter.
Phil didn't take the job anyway.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.709
If anything, my little test
proved how much he loved you.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.341
You're welcome. We'll talk in the morning.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.851
How dare you? "You're welcome." Please!

17:54.908 --> 17:56.683
I can't even be in the same room with you.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.154
- Where is my coat?
- Uh, Claire?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.690
Oh, unbelievable.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.249
"I don't like my son-in-law,
so I'm gonna ship him off to Texas."

18:02.315 --> 18:04.795
- Real mature way to deal with your problems, Dad.
- I get that point.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.457
Yeah, real mature.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.022
That's real mature too.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.864
That's tradition. it's the skeleton-

18:10.924 --> 18:12.904
In the closet! Oh, I get it.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.461
I'm really sorry.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.234
But before you go storming out of here...

18:16.296 --> 18:20.676
you wanna talk about a certain phone call
I got from immigration a few years ago?

18:20.733 --> 18:24.579
I'd just started dating Gloria.
They were acting on an anonymous tip?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.720
It's very late.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.983
We have a very big day tomorrow.

18:32.045 --> 18:35.219
You know, Claire,
I've really come to like Phil.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.851
I know.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.693
And the irony is,
he would really love that skeleton gag.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.097
Try it out on him. You gotta take care
of that thing till next year.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.567
Oh, God.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.967
Before you turn that out...

18:46.025 --> 18:47.766
have we talked
about everything we need to?

18:47.827 --> 18:50.433
'Cause I want everything
out in the clear here.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.774
- Yeah. We have.
- Good night.

19:01.741 --> 19:06.622
I did make out with Rita once,
about 15 years ago. Good night.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.928
Okay.

19:10.984 --> 19:16.935
All that's left... is to reattach
the lander to the command module.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.628
We got one shot at this, fellas.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.365
If we fail, Jay's gonna burn up
on reentry into this house. Am I right?

19:21.427 --> 19:24.772
- Ha! Hole in one, Son.
- Thanks, Dad.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.779
Boys, if this thing goes sideways,
I don't want you to be here to see it. So go on.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.247
- But, Dad-
- No, you listen to me!

19:40.914 --> 19:42.655
Okay, Phil.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.153
Okay, Philip.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.663
Steady,

19:47.487 --> 19:48.659
He's locked in.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.832
Not now, nerves.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.011
Hold. Hold.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.074
Be a hero. Bring her home.

20:04.137 --> 20:07.118
- I guess I'll calla cab.
- So long Jeanine.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.051
Is it? Is-

20:13.713 --> 20:15.784
it is! Splashdown!

20:15.848 --> 20:17.156
Whoo!

20:17.217 --> 20:20.960
¡Ay. sì, gracias!

20:21.020 --> 20:23.523
Son of a bitch did it.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.366
Oh, yeah!

20:28.761 --> 20:31.674
Yeah! Gloria, get in here!

20:31.731 --> 20:34.143
- There we go!
- Dad, you did it!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.873
Yes, I did! I love it!

20:35.935 --> 20:39.678
I love it! I love it!

20:39.739 --> 20:41.650
Oh, my God.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.891
Phil, honey! Come to bed!

20:50.950 --> 20:53.521
This robe feels like butter.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.467
Yeah! I missed this, honey.

21:00.526 --> 21:03.097
That yoga's really paying off!

21:03.162 --> 21:05.233
Hey, whoa, slow down, baby.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.539
You can't gun a cold engine.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.441
But if you're- Then who's-

21:11.504 --> 21:13.780
- When did you know?
- When it didn't complain about my socks.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.945
You checked the closet, didn't you?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.852
Every night before bed.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.548
I really don't understand that.
It's so silly.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.558
I mean, if somebody
really wanted to kill you...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.992
obviously they'd just hide under the bed.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.996
Good night.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.588
Damn it.
