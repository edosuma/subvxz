WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.676
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.776 --> 00:11.312
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE NEVER ONCE
TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY

00:11.412 --> 00:13.081
FOR WHAT YOU DID?
YOU NEVER ONCE SAID,

00:13.181 --> 00:14.948
"I'M SORRY.
I MADE A MISTAKE."

00:15.049 --> 00:16.717
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT WILLING TO FORGIVE ME

00:16.817 --> 00:19.019
BECAUSE HE HASN'T
MADE UP HIS MIND ABOUT
THIS OTHER WOMAN YET.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.888
BY THE WAY,
ANOTHER THING
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT--

00:20.988 --> 00:23.757
WHAT KIND
OF MOTHER YOU'VE BEEN.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?

00:23.857 --> 00:27.195
YOU SHOULD REALLY BE QUIET
RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.363
GINA, YOU SAID THAT
I MIGHT'VE PUSHED

00:29.463 --> 00:33.467
KATE INTO HER AFFAIR
BECAUSE OF MY FEELINGS
FOR LAURA.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.868
MAYBE IT'S
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.804
YOU'RE BOTH GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.872
SHE'S STRUGGLING
WITH A DYNAMIC

00:38.972 --> 00:40.974
THAT EXISTED
BEFORE YOU MET

00:41.075 --> 00:43.544
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THAT YOUNGER WOMAN

00:43.644 --> 00:46.614
WHO LOOKS UP TO YOU
THE WAY KATE USED TO.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.817
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S JUST REALLY GREAT.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.023
- HI, GINA.
- HI, PAUL.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.459
HOW ARE YOU?

00:58.559 --> 01:02.396
SO, OBVIOUSLY
KATE ISN'T COMING TODAY.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.365
YES, SHE LEFT ME
A MESSAGE.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.135
SHE REALLY DIDN'T GO
INTO WHY THOUGH.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.438
SHE SAID SHE WAS TIRED
OF GOING BACK AND FORTH

01:10.538 --> 01:12.940
AND SHE'S TIRED
OF TRYING TO FIND OUT

01:13.040 --> 01:15.075
WHO STARTED WHAT
AND WHO WAS GUILTY OF WHAT

01:15.176 --> 01:16.677
AND WHO'S
REACTING TO WHAT.

01:16.777 --> 01:20.248
SHE WANTS TO DECIDE
ON HER OWN, BASICALLY.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.684
WELL, I HAVE TO
RESPECT THAT.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.287
( theme music playing )

01:42.570 --> 01:45.406
HOW DO YOU
THINK OUR SESSIONS
WITH KATE WENT?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.541
I'D SAY
THEY WERE CHAOTIC.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.310
I WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED
WITH YOU OVER THAT,

01:49.410 --> 01:52.246
BUT I SUPPOSE
I'M PARTLY AT FAULT TOO.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.015
AND I ALSO THINK
THAT SHE FELT SANDWICHED

01:55.115 --> 01:57.318
BETWEEN TWO THERAPISTS.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.387
I DO HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH,

01:59.487 --> 02:01.755
THAT YOU DID MANAGE
TO MAKE CONNECTIONS

02:01.855 --> 02:04.958
THAT RESONATED
WITH BOTH OF US,
ESPECIALLY WITH KATE.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.761
WHETHER ANYTHING IS
GONNA COME OF THAT
OR NOT, I DON'T--

02:07.861 --> 02:10.231
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

02:10.331 --> 02:15.102
MMM. YOU KNOW
WHO I ENVY?

02:15.203 --> 02:17.405
WRITERS. THEY CREATE
THESE CHARACTERS

02:17.505 --> 02:19.106
THAT THEY WANT
TO SPEND TIME WITH,

02:19.207 --> 02:21.609
AND THEN THEY DECIDE
IF THEY'RE GONNA

02:21.709 --> 02:23.143
LET THEM LIVE OR DIE

02:23.244 --> 02:25.979
OR LET THEM BE
HAPPY OR UNHAPPY,

02:26.079 --> 02:28.416
LET THEM BE
FAILURES OR SUCCESSES.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.451
YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO WRITE
EVERYBODY'S STORY FOR THEM?

02:30.551 --> 02:34.087
( chuckles )
MIND YOU, I THINK
I'D BE A SHITTY WRITER.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.624
I'D WANT TO GIVE
EVERYBODY A HAPPY ENDING.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.931
PAUL...

02:44.031 --> 02:46.400
I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
ALEX.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.774
YEAH. THANKS.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.345
NOT THE ENDING
I WOULD HAVE
WRITTEN FOR HIM.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.179
( sighs )
THE FUNERAL--
JESUS CHRIST,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.415
I'D FORGOTTEN
HOW AWFUL FUNERALS ARE.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.218
THAT DREADFUL SENSE THAT--

03:05.619 --> 03:07.788
THAT IN THE END
THERE'S ONLY SILENCE.

03:07.888 --> 03:12.192
YOU'D THINK AS THERAPISTS,
WE'D HAVE BETTER TOOLS
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

03:12.293 --> 03:16.664
WELL, I DON'T.
I FEEL THE SAME SENSE OF...

03:16.764 --> 03:20.968
FUTILITY AND HOPELESSNESS
AS THE NEXT GUY.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.103
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S ALSO
INTERESTING IS SEEING
THE RELATIVES

03:23.203 --> 03:25.639
OF PATIENTS
THAT YOU'VE TREATED.

03:25.739 --> 03:29.076
THE PARTICIPANTS IN
THE STORIES THAT YOU'VE
HEARD DOZENS OF TIMES--

03:29.176 --> 03:31.979
THE FATHER, THE SON,
THE BROTHER-- WHOEVER.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.147
WE THINK WE KNOW THEM,

03:34.248 --> 03:35.816
BUT WE DON'T
REALLY KNOW THEM AT ALL.

03:35.916 --> 03:39.387
WE KNOW REACTIONS TO THEM
OR VERSIONS OF THEM--

03:39.487 --> 03:42.723
IDEALIZED OR VILIFIED.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.559
AND I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING
TO RECONCILE THIS IMAGE

03:45.659 --> 03:47.595
THAT I HAD
OF ALEX'S WIFE

03:47.695 --> 03:49.763
WITH THE WOMAN
THAT I SAW THERE.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.566
HE ALWAYS DESCRIBED HER
AS DEMANDING, EXACTING,

03:52.666 --> 03:55.436
A CONSTANT SORT
OF PRESSURE IN HIS LIFE.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.738
BUT I LOOKED OVER
AND I JUST SAW THIS...

04:01.942 --> 04:03.611
BROKEN WOMAN.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.480
SHE SEEMED
SO SOFT AND GENTLE.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.882
GUESS I'LL NEVER
REALLY KNOW HER NOW.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.985
- DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?
- IT DOES BOTHER ME.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.754
I ASK MYSELF
ALL THE TIME

04:13.854 --> 04:16.824
IF I ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT I THINK I KNOW
ABOUT MY PATIENTS' LIVES.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.792
THAT COUPLE,
FOR EXAMPLE,

04:18.892 --> 04:22.930
THE ONES WHO WERE
TRYING TO HAVE THE BABY.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.266
AMY-- I DON'T THINK
SHE CAN EVER REALLY BE KNOWN.

04:26.367 --> 04:30.203
I MEAN, THERE ARE
CERTAIN PATTERNS THAT
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES

04:30.304 --> 04:33.607
FROM HER PAST,
BUT I CANNOT...

04:33.707 --> 04:35.476
SHRINK HER.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.478
SHE'S TOO COMPLICATED.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.212
AND THEN I SAY TO MYSELF

04:39.313 --> 04:41.649
"DO I REALLY KNOW
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE,

04:41.749 --> 04:45.252
OR ARE THEY ALL
JUST ONE BIG FICTION

04:45.353 --> 04:48.489
THAT I'VE CONSTRUCTED
IN MY HEAD?" YOU KNOW?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.958
SOMETIMES I DREAM
ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS

04:51.058 --> 04:54.595
OF PATIENTS THAT I'M TREATING,
PEOPLE I'VE NEVER MET.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.764
YOU KNOW,
IT'S CURIOUS.

04:56.864 --> 05:01.134
APART FROM
YOUR INTENSE CONNECTION
WITH YOUR PATIENTS,

05:01.234 --> 05:03.571
YOU'RE ALSO
NOW TALKING ABOUT

05:03.671 --> 05:07.741
A LONGING
FOR YOUR PATIENTS'
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.511
( sighs )
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, "A LONGING"?

05:10.611 --> 05:13.080
MAYBE THAT'S
NOT THE RIGHT WORD.

05:13.180 --> 05:17.117
DO YOU MEAN CURIOSITY
ABOUT THE LIVES
OF OTHER PEOPLE?

05:17.217 --> 05:19.052
ISN'T THAT AN ASPECT
OF WHAT WE DO?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.021
IT'S JUST--
IT'S CURIOSITY.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.525
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FASCINATED
BY HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE,

05:24.625 --> 05:28.429
AT LEAST--
AT LEAST I THINK SO.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.536
ALEX'S DEATH
LEFT ME WITH THIS
VERY STRONG FEELING

05:35.636 --> 05:39.607
THAT I WAS
LIKE A REPOSITORY,
REALLY, A TRUSTEE.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.478
THERE WERE THINGS THAT
HE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ELSE,

05:44.578 --> 05:47.214
HIS PRIVATE THOUGHTS,
AND THEY'VE STAYED WITH ME.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.249
THEY'RE INSIDE ME.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.421
A BIG PART OF HIS LIFE
IS IN THIS VAULT
I HAVE INSIDE ME.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.390
A PART
OF HIS LIFE MAYBE,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.492
BUT NOT NECESSARILY
A BIG PART.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.893
YOU WERE
HIS THERAPIST.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.430
- ONLY HIS THERAPIST, YES.
- YES.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.665
I KNOW YOU'VE
ALWAYS BEEN OF TWO MINDS

06:04.765 --> 06:07.735
IN RELATION TO THIS,
THAT THERAPY IS

06:07.835 --> 06:10.571
MORE THAN A DISCIPLINE,
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A RELIGION.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.172
BUT YOU ALSO SAY
WE'RE THERAPISTS

06:12.272 --> 06:16.143
AND WE CAN'T REALLY RUN
OUR PATIENTS' LIVES FOR THEM.

06:16.243 --> 06:19.079
AS SOON AS THEY
WALK OUT THE DOOR,
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN, YEAH?

06:24.818 --> 06:27.387
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
ALEX'S STATE OF MIND

06:27.488 --> 06:29.457
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?

06:29.557 --> 06:32.426
I WOULD SAY HE WAS
PRETTY FRAGILE,
VULNERABLE. YEAH.

06:32.526 --> 06:37.030
YOU KNOW, THE IRONIC THING
IS THAT WE'D REALLY MADE
SOME GOOD PROGRESS,

06:37.130 --> 06:38.699
AND HE JUST SEEMED
TO REGRESS.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.369
IT WAS LIKE HE FELT
THAT HE WAS SO CLOSE

06:42.470 --> 06:44.538
TO A BREAKTHROUGH
THAT IT SCARED HIM.

06:44.638 --> 06:49.009
IT WAS TOO MUCH
AND HE JUST...

06:49.109 --> 06:50.911
ГіГі
HE TURNED AWAY
FROM IT.

06:51.011 --> 06:55.148
ARE YOU FEELING
IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS DEATH?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.891
( clears throat )
YOU KNOW, I'M FRIENDLY
WITH A PSYCHIATRIST

07:03.991 --> 07:06.393
THAT CONSULTS
FOR THE NAVY--
ALFONSO CAILLAS.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.995
- DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?
- OH YEAH.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.898
WELL, I ASKED HIM
IF HE COULD FIND OUT ANYTHING.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.533
HE SAID VERTIGO.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.536
IT MEANS
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE EQUIPMENT.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.871
THEY WERE DOING SOME KIND
OF COMBAT EXERCISE.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.273
THE PLANE HE WAS
CHASING DESCENDED

07:20.373 --> 07:21.642
AND ALEX WENT
INTO VERTIGO--

07:21.742 --> 07:24.912
WHAT THEY CALL VERTIGO--
AND LOST CONTROL.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.114
THAT'S THEIR...

07:27.214 --> 07:29.182
OFFICIAL CONCLUSION.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.987
I THINK
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.356
- HOW CAN YOU
BE SURE OF THAT?
- LOOK, HIS LIFE WAS...

07:36.456 --> 07:38.225
A TRAGEDY
FROM THE SECOND
HE WAS BORN--

07:38.325 --> 07:41.328
HIS CHILDHOOD,
HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIS FATHER,

07:41.428 --> 07:42.563
RIGHT UP TO THE TIME
HE PUSHED THE BUTTON

07:42.663 --> 07:44.231
AND KILLED A ROOMFUL
OF KIDS.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.333
HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH THAT?

07:46.433 --> 07:48.636
EVEN WITH THE GADGETS
THAT THEY HAVE NOW

07:48.736 --> 07:50.771
THAT REDUCE PEOPLE
TO DOTS ON A VIDEO SCREEN,

07:50.871 --> 07:52.540
ALL THE SPIN
FROM THE NAVY--

07:52.640 --> 07:54.207
NONE OF IT MADE
ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIM.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.909
IT DIDN'T WORK ON HIM.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.880
HE FELT EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THOSE DEATHS.
I KNOW HE DID.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.654
OH, SO MANY EXPECTATIONS.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.291
THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.695
HMM.
AND HE WAS.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.832
HE WAS SO STRONG
PHYSICALLY

08:18.932 --> 08:22.335
AND HANDSOME,
INTELLIGENT.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.238
AND UNDER ALL THAT
KIND OF POSTURING

08:25.338 --> 08:27.174
AND MALE POSING
THAT HE DID,

08:27.274 --> 08:29.242
HE WAS REALLY...

08:33.714 --> 08:35.515
HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.219
CHARMING.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.654
HE WAS ENDEARING,
YOU KNOW?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.190
HE LOOKED
AND HE SOUNDED LIKE...

08:43.290 --> 08:45.258
WHAT THEY CALL
A WINNER.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.427
SUDDENLY HE BECOMES
A MURDERER.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.030
HOW DO YOU
RECONCILE THAT?

08:51.665 --> 08:53.734
I THINK THAT'S
WHAT REALLY KILLED HIM.

08:53.834 --> 08:58.238
ENDEARING.
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.373
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.309
ACTUALLY, HE WAS
KIND OF A FUNNY GUY.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.345
HE WAS...

09:05.445 --> 09:09.449
I DON'T KNOW.
AM I ALREADY BEGINNING
TO IDEALIZE HIM?

09:09.549 --> 09:13.053
- YEAH, MAYBE.
- WELL, IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

09:13.153 --> 09:14.922
AFTER SUCH A SHOCK.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.858
HE GAVE ME THE CHANCE
TO STOP HIM FROM FLYING.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.461
LITERALLY?
DID HE REALLY OFFER THAT
OR ARE YOU PROJECTING?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.164
HE ASKED ME DIRECTLY,
"SHOULD I FLY?"

09:24.264 --> 09:27.400
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- I TOLD HIM I WAS
VERY CONCERNED

09:27.500 --> 09:30.003
ABOUT HIS STATE
OF MIND.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.505
- YOU SAID THAT CLEARLY?
- MM-HMM.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.709
BUT HE WANTED ME
TO SAY IT UNEQUIVOCALLY,

09:35.809 --> 09:38.478
- "DO NOT FLY."
- IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE, PAUL.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.716
A PATIENT CAN'T ASK YOU
TO TAKE HIS LIFE
INTO YOUR HANDS.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.452
IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE
TO SAY, "DON'T FLY"

09:45.552 --> 09:47.855
ANY MORE THAN
IT'S YOUR PLACE

09:47.955 --> 09:50.090
TO SAY TO THAT COUPLE,
"HAVE AN ABORTION."

09:50.190 --> 09:53.661
OR TO LAURA, "MARRY
OR DON'T MARRY YOUR FIANCE."

09:53.761 --> 09:57.130
I SHOULD HAVE SENT
THE NAVY AN EVALUATION.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.967
"GUILT-RIDDEN.
WANTS TO PUNISH HIMSELF.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.102
SHOULDN'T FLY."

10:02.202 --> 10:05.605
ALEX'S DAD CAME
INTO THE OFFICE TO...

10:05.706 --> 10:07.775
HUH, TO TALK.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.610
SO I HAD THIS POOR GUY
YELLING AT ME

10:10.711 --> 10:12.946
SAYING THAT
HIS SON'S REPRESSION

10:13.046 --> 10:16.083
WAS WHAT HAD KEPT
HIM ALIVE ALL THE TIME,

10:16.183 --> 10:19.853
AND THAT THERAPY--
THE STUFF THAT HE WAS
DOING WITH ME--

10:21.822 --> 10:23.824
THAT THERAPY WAS
THE THING THAT KILLED HIM.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.560
- OH, GOD, PAUL.
- UP IN THE AIR AT MACH 5,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.296
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE EMOTIONS,

10:29.396 --> 10:30.798
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO THINK.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.901
THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY HE CRASHED.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.404
( sighs heavily )

10:37.504 --> 10:40.207
HE WAS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT I IMAGINED, ALSO.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.777
HE WAS RIDDLED WITH,
YOU KNOW, HIS OWN GUILT.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.981
ACTUALLY, HE DID MAKE
A COUPLE OF GOOD POINTS.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.917
HE SAID THINGS WERE
IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
FOR A REASON,

10:50.017 --> 10:52.652
BECAUSE THE MIND
CANNOT LIVE

10:52.753 --> 10:54.621
OR BREATHE OR TAKE
A SINGLE STEP

10:54.722 --> 10:56.790
IF EVERYTHING
THAT LIES DORMANT IN IT

10:56.890 --> 10:59.827
WERE OUT THERE
IN DAYLIGHT, FULLY LIT.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.763
A FULLY-CONSCIOUS HUMAN BEING
WOULD BE PARALYZED,

11:02.863 --> 11:05.699
WOULD BE LIKE
A CRIPPLE.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.600
ALEX DIDN'T NEED
TO BE CONSCIOUS,

11:07.701 --> 11:12.405
JUST MERELY EFFICIENT.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.609
DO YOU REALLY ACCEPT THAT?
THAT LIFE IS BETTER LIVED
UNEXAMINED?

11:16.710 --> 11:19.646
AND WHEN--
WHEN ANXIETY,

11:19.747 --> 11:22.115
FEAR AND PAIN
BUBBLE UP FROM BELOW,

11:22.215 --> 11:25.585
HOW CAN THAT
BE DEALT WITH EXCEPT
BY LOOKING AT IT?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.454
EXCEPT BY ANALYZING IT?

11:27.554 --> 11:30.123
BUT WE DON'T RUN
THE SHOW, PAUL.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.894
I SOMETIMES THINK
THAT THERAPISTS CAN
START TO IMAGINE

11:33.994 --> 11:35.695
THEY'RE LIKE WRITERS,

11:35.796 --> 11:38.665
THAT THEY CAN CONTROL
THE OUTCOME.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.200
WE DON'T LIVE
THEIR LIVES FOR THEM.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.702
WE DON'T EVEN LIVE
THEIR LIVES WITH THEM.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.271
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE THAT

11:44.371 --> 11:47.808
WE REALLY DO HAVE
AN INFLUENCE THAT'S
ALWAYS POSITIVE.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.910
WE HELP PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND--

11:50.010 --> 11:51.278
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
THEY'RE FEELING.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.846
AND AFTER THAT,
IF THEY MAKE A WRONG TURN,

11:52.946 --> 11:56.083
THEN IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.
IT'S HUMAN ERROR.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.185
THA-- ANYWAY...

11:58.285 --> 12:01.454
- WHO ARE YOU
REALLY ANGRY AT?
- MYSELF, OBVIOUSLY.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.223
YOU. HUH.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.692
EVERY THERAPIST
FROM FREUD TO MITCHELL.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.829
- WHY?
- BECAUSE...

12:08.929 --> 12:11.264
WE FORCE PATIENTS
TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES

12:11.364 --> 12:14.601
AND PAT OURSELVES
ON THE BACK FOR IT.

12:14.701 --> 12:17.404
THEN WE SAY
TO THEM, "HERE'S WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.206
NOW OFF YOU GO."

12:21.141 --> 12:24.577
- DID YOU FEEL
THIS WAY BEFORE ALEX DIED?
- MORE OR LESS, YEAH.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.380
HAS IT BEEN
ON YOUR MIND RECENTLY
IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.749
- LIKE WHAT?
- I'M ASKING.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.552
HAVE OTHER PATIENTS
OTHER THAN ALEX

12:32.652 --> 12:34.554
- MADE YOU THINK LIKE THIS?
- YOU'RE INSINUATING.

12:34.654 --> 12:39.692
NO, I'M JUST
TRYING TO GET
A SENSE, A HISTORY...

12:39.793 --> 12:42.262
OF THESE FEELINGS
ABOUT PSYCHOTHERAPY.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.331
YOU MEAN HAVE I BEEN
WONDERING FOR A WHILE

12:44.431 --> 12:48.235
IF OUR PROFESSION IS
ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO PEOPLE?

12:48.335 --> 12:51.371
YES, I HAVE.
I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.575
SO YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOT ABLE
TO HELP YOUR PATIENTS?

12:55.675 --> 12:58.778
THE GYMNAST,
FOR EXAMPLE-- SOPHIE.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.548
WELL, HONESTLY I FEEL

13:01.648 --> 13:03.016
THAT SHE MADE
A LOT OF PROGRESS.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.785
WE CONNECTED.
THERE WAS A BOND
BETWEEN US.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.255
BUT I THINK IT WAS
THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

13:08.355 --> 13:10.523
THAT HELPED HER,
NOT THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.426
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YALOM IS RIGHT.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.930
MAYBE IT IS
THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT ACTUALLY HEALS.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.999
BUT THAT OTHER COUPLE,
JAKE AND AMY,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.168
I CANNOT TELL YOU,
HONESTLY,

13:21.268 --> 13:24.905
IF THEY'RE BETTER OFF
TOGETHER OR APART.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.875
I DON'T KNOW
IF I HELPED THEM AT ALL.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.912
ANYWAY...

13:34.848 --> 13:36.449
ARE YOU OKAY, PAUL?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.919
I THINK
I'M TIRED, GINA.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.022
- HERE, PUT YOUR FEET UP.
- ( wood scrapes )

13:46.093 --> 13:47.527
MMM.

13:55.969 --> 14:00.707
YOU KNOW, ALEX,
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT VERTIGO

14:00.807 --> 14:03.476
AND HE SAID THAT
WHEN IT HAPPENS,

14:03.576 --> 14:06.113
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
TRUST THEIR INSTRUMENTS

14:06.213 --> 14:08.882
- AND NOT THEIR SENSES.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.450
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.887
I ONCE HAD A BOYFRIEND
WHO WAS A COMMERCIAL PILOT.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.023
THIS WAS BEFORE DAVID.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.325
HE TAUGHT ME THAT...

14:20.027 --> 14:21.995
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.864
( chuckles )

14:24.965 --> 14:29.136
YES, PAUL.
I HAVE BEEN MORE
THAN A SLEEPY SPIDER.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.770
HMM.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.306
- SO IT SEEMS.
- MM-HMM.

14:35.742 --> 14:39.146
ANYWAY, I THINK
IT'S THE OPPOSITE
FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.614
I THINK WE'D BE
FAR MORE EFFECTIVE

14:41.714 --> 14:45.585
IF WE RELIED
LESS ON INSTRUMENTS,
THEORIES AND BOOKS

14:45.685 --> 14:47.320
AND MORE
ON OUR OWN INSTINCTS.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.191
SO ALL YOUR TRAINING,
ALL YOUR KNOWLEDGE

14:51.291 --> 14:54.427
- CAN LEAD YOU ASTRAY?
- I THINK SO.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.429
DO YOU FEEL THIS
GENERALLY

14:56.529 --> 14:58.999
OR ABOUT CERTAIN PATIENTS
IN PARTICULAR?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.434
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.136
WHAT IS IT, GINA?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.105
WHAT?

15:05.205 --> 15:08.475
YOU'VE GOT
THAT LOOK OF YOURS.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.844
- WHAT LOOK IS THAT?
- YOU HAVE THE LOOK
THAT SAYS,

15:11.945 --> 15:13.546
"I HAVE A THEORY."

15:13.646 --> 15:17.484
- REGARDING WHAT?
- OH, COME ON,
CUT THE CRAP.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.052
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.753
I'M JUST SITTING HERE
LISTENING TO YOU.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.290
I'M LISTENING
TO YOUR NEWFOUND THEORIES

15:23.390 --> 15:25.358
ABOUT THE USELESSNESS
OF PSYCHOTHERAPY.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.129
"CERTAIN PATIENTS
IN PARTICULAR"?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.732
( chuckles )

15:32.832 --> 15:35.935
COME ON, WE'RE BACK
TO LAURA AGAIN.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.338
ARE WE?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.540
YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS
A REACTION TO LAURA.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.011
- WHAT'S A REACTION?
- ME CRITICIZING PSYCHOLOGY,

15:44.111 --> 15:46.579
DISMISSING THEORIES.
YOU THINK I'M MAKING EXCUSES.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.150
EVEN ALEX GETTING KILLED--
THAT'S AN EXCUSE, RIGHT?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.752
PSYCHOLOGY IS
COLLAPSING,

15:52.852 --> 15:54.988
SO I MIGHT AS WELL
SLEEP WITH LAURA.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.490
- I THINK THAT'S KIND
OF THE WAY YOU'RE--
- IS THAT WHAT I'M THINKING?

15:57.590 --> 16:01.128
- WELL, AM I WRONG?
- WHEN YOU GUESS WHAT
I'M THINKING,

16:01.228 --> 16:02.562
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT LAURA.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.098
LIKE I ASSUME
THAT EVERYTHING YOU SAY

16:05.198 --> 16:07.000
- IS CONNECTED TO HER.
- DON'T YOU?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.736
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT HER UP.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.871
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT LAURA.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.374
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FACT THAT

16:14.474 --> 16:18.145
I AM HAVING TROUBLE LATELY
BELIEVING IN THIS...

16:18.245 --> 16:20.547
- RELIGION OF YOURS.
- OF MINE?

16:20.647 --> 16:25.318
I DON'T THINK
TRADITIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
ANSWERS ANYTHING ANYMORE.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.819
YOU HAVE
TWO EXTREMES, RIGHT?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.355
YOU HAVE
POP PSYCHOLOGY,

16:28.455 --> 16:30.490
YOU'VE GOT
THESE CELEBRITY THERAPISTS

16:30.590 --> 16:33.260
WRITING BEST SELLERS,
GETTING ON TALK SHOWS,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.895
AND MAKING
SOME MISERABLE COUPLE
WEEP ON TELEVISION.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.164
IT'S A KIND
OF A PORNOGRAPHY.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.998
AND THEN
ON THE OTHER HAND,

16:39.099 --> 16:40.633
YOU'VE GOT THE EXPERTS,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.735
PSYCHOLOGISTS
LIKE YOU.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.372
ORTHODOX,
AUTHORITY FIGURES.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.141
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL
AND SUPERVISED,

16:48.241 --> 16:49.909
EXAMINED UNDER
A BRIGHT LIGHT,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.578
EXAMINED TO DEATH,

16:51.678 --> 16:55.982
COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY DIVORCED
FROM REAL LIFE.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.950
AM I DIVORCED
FROM REAL LIFE?

16:58.051 --> 17:00.420
GINA, YOU'VE NEVER LIVED
OUTSIDE THIS ROOM--

17:00.520 --> 17:04.257
THE INSTITUTE,
THE GRADUATE PROGRAM,

17:04.357 --> 17:07.127
DAVID'S WORLD.
AND AFTER DAVID DIED,

17:07.227 --> 17:08.628
YOU LOCKED
YOURSELF UP IN HERE.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.530
I MEAN,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ROOM.
LOOK AT IT.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.401
BEAUTIFULLY APPOINTED,
EVERYTHING IS IN ITS PLACE.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.804
BUT YOU SIT IN HERE,
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

17:17.904 --> 17:20.173
YOU WRITE FICTION,

17:20.273 --> 17:23.210
ABOUT HOW LIFE
COULD HAVE BEEN,
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.745
IS THAT WHAT
I'M WRITING?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.914
I DON'T KNOW.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.782
JUST ASK YOURSELF,
AS A THERAPIST,

17:29.882 --> 17:33.019
CAN YOU REALLY HELP ANYBODY
IF YOU LIVE IN A BUBBLE?

17:33.120 --> 17:36.323
SO NOW I'M A SLEEPY SPIDER
IN A BUBBLE.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.291
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU, GINA.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.627
- I--
- YOU WON'T.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.963
I FORGOT.
OF COURSE.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.433
YOU DON'T GET UPSET.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.336
- YOU NEVER LOSE IT.
- PAUL.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.305
I'VE LOST IT
HERE WITH YOU

17:52.405 --> 17:55.842
SEVERAL TIMES
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.149
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO PROVOKE ME?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.451
I AM NOT TRYING
TO PROVOKE YOU.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.887
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO END UP LIKE THIS.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.589
IS THIS IT?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.762
THIS IS HOW THERAPISTS
LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.764
YOU ARE PERVERSE.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.868
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING REAL
AND POWERFUL CAME
INTO YOUR LIFE

18:21.968 --> 18:23.069
AND YOU NEVER
GAVE IT A CHANCE.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.539
NOT FOR CHARLIE'S SAKE
OR FOR YOURS.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.309
I KNOW YOU SAID IT WAS
BECAUSE HE WAS A PATIENT,

18:29.409 --> 18:31.211
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

18:31.311 --> 18:33.112
I THINK
IT WAS BULLSHIT.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.348
- PAUL, BE CAREFUL.
- YOU WERE TERRIFIED.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.251
CHARLIE TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE

18:38.351 --> 18:41.188
THE BIGGEST
LOSS IN HIS LIFE.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.991
THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE
COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.660
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.867
I MEAN,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

18:54.967 --> 18:56.603
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.474
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH?

19:01.574 --> 19:05.178
IT'S NOT THAT
I'M TOO RESERVED,

19:05.278 --> 19:07.380
TOO DETACHED.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.783
IT'S THAT
I'M TOO EMOTIONAL.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.886
I'M IMPULSIVE
AND EMOTIONAL

19:13.986 --> 19:16.122
AND I GIVE MYSELF OVER
RIGHT AWAY

19:16.223 --> 19:17.657
AND PASSIONATELY.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.692
I POUR MYSELF OUT.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.295
CAN'T YOU SEE

19:22.395 --> 19:24.364
THAT I'M
PROTECTING MYSELF

19:24.464 --> 19:27.234
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
I'LL GET CARRIED AWAY?

19:27.334 --> 19:30.069
I WON'T BE ABLE TO THINK,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO ANALYZ,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.272
I WON'T BE ABLE TO WORK.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.508
YOU'VE CREATED
THIS COLD VERSION OF ME

19:35.608 --> 19:38.745
THAT'S LIMITING
AND CASTRATING...

19:40.079 --> 19:43.783
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE
ARGUING WITH ME

19:43.883 --> 19:48.688
YOU WANT TO SEE YOURSELF
AS BATTLING THE FORCES
OF REPRESSION.

19:48.788 --> 19:53.293
AND IF THE TRUTH IS THAT
I'M AN EMOTIONAL PERSON

19:53.393 --> 19:55.562
WHO HAS TO
REIN HERSELF IN,

19:55.662 --> 19:58.965
IT DOESN'T FIT
WITH WHAT YOU NEED,
NOW DOES IT?

20:10.410 --> 20:13.313
OF COURSE
I WANTED CHARLIE.

20:17.450 --> 20:21.621
HE WAS
THE MOST ALIVE PERSON
I EVER MET.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.791
I WANTED TO SLEEP WITH HIM.
I WANTED TO EAT HIM UP.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.461
BUT I DIDN'T...

20:28.561 --> 20:30.763
AND NOT
BECAUSE OF ETHICS.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.165
I MAY HAVE TOLD HIM

20:33.266 --> 20:36.303
IT WAS BECAUSE
HE WAS A PATIENT,

20:36.403 --> 20:38.538
BUT THE REAL REASON
WAS DAVID,

20:38.638 --> 20:42.875
EVEN THOUGH
DAVID CHEATED ON ME
FOR HOWEVER MANY YEARS.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.647
YES. I KNEW THAT
ALL ALONG.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.717
HE WAS REALLY SHITTY
AT HIDING IT.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.688
I DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH CHARLIE BECAUSE...

20:57.790 --> 21:00.259
THAT'S NOT
WHO I WANTED TO BE.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.129
I LOVED DAVID

21:03.229 --> 21:05.365
AND I LOVED
THE LIFE WE HAD

21:05.465 --> 21:07.534
AND WHO I WAS
WITH HIM.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.236
I LOVED MYSELF
WITH DAVID.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.972
DAVID'S GINA.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.351
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.858
WHEN I WAS
STANDING OVER...

21:36.128 --> 21:38.665
HIS GRAVE
AT THE FUNERAL...

21:39.932 --> 21:41.634
I THOUGHT...

21:42.669 --> 21:45.738
IF I WAS
MAGICALLY REBORN...

21:45.838 --> 21:47.374
( crying )

21:47.474 --> 21:50.343
I WOULD CHOOSE HIM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.416
FOR ALL HIS FAULTS...

21:57.517 --> 21:58.751
( sniffles )

21:58.851 --> 22:01.654
HE ALLOWED ME TO BE
WHO I WANTED TO BE.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.464
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT,

22:11.564 --> 22:13.800
HOW CRAZY I WAS
ABOUT HIM.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.369
HE WAS EVERYTHING.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.373
I NEVER HEARD
YOU SAY IT.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.442
OH, SHIT.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.977
EVERYTHING HAS TO
BE SAID?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.517
AND NOW I HAVE TO
SIT HERE AND LISTEN

22:30.617 --> 22:32.985
TO YOUR CRAPPY,
NEARSIGHTED,

22:33.085 --> 22:35.822
SELF-INVOLVED THEORIES

22:35.922 --> 22:37.690
ABOUT MY LIFE.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.593
OH GOD.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.297
LISTEN TO US.

22:45.398 --> 22:49.368
YOU KNOW, I SLAP YOU
AND YOU PUNCH ME.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.541
SOMETIMES I TELL MYSELF
IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE,

22:54.641 --> 22:58.010
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SO SURE ANYMORE.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.912
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.419
( both sigh )

23:06.519 --> 23:09.255
YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ME
FOR TWO MONTHS,

23:09.355 --> 23:12.559
SAYING "LAURA,
LAURA, LAURA."

23:12.659 --> 23:16.629
AND YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS
IMAGINARY GINA OF YOURS

23:16.729 --> 23:18.998
TO JUMP IN
AND STOP YOU.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.902
YOU KNOW...
( clears throat)

23:23.002 --> 23:27.139
PAUL, I'M NOT
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.910
YOU'RE FIGHTING YOURSELF.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.881
IT'S UP TO YOU.
IT'S LIKE ALEX.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.384
YOU KNOW, YOU CAREFULLY
LOOKED AT HIS LIFE,

23:38.485 --> 23:40.052
YOU OPENED DOORS
FOR HIM,

23:40.152 --> 23:42.254
YOU GAVE HIM INSIGHT,

23:42.354 --> 23:45.324
BUT HIS LIFE WAS HIS.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.994
AND HE DECIDED TO FLY.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.298
NOW YOU DECIDE.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.567
YOU KNOW,
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.137
MAYBE LOVE CAN BLOOM
IN A THERAPIST'S OFFICE.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.807
AND, YOU KNOW,
ETHICS AND RULES--

24:00.907 --> 24:03.776
LOVE IS BIGGER
THAN ANY RULES.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.480
AND WHAT DO I KNOW?

24:08.214 --> 24:10.316
MAYBE SHE'S YOUR DAVID.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.318
MAYBE YOU CAN ONLY BE

24:12.418 --> 24:15.121
THE PAUL YOU WANT
TO BE WITH HER.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.627
SO GO TO HER.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.096
FIND OUT.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.935
BUT PLEASE...

24:29.035 --> 24:33.506
STOP COMPARING
YOUR LIFE TO MINE.

24:36.375 --> 24:40.079
STOP USING CHARLIE
AGAINST ME.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.683
YOU KNOW,
I'M SORRY HE WAS HURT
BY WHAT HAPPENED...

24:45.051 --> 24:46.953
BUT I NEVER LOVED HIM,

24:47.053 --> 24:48.688
NOT FOR A DAY.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.758
I LOVED DAVID.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.530
SO NEVER TALK TO ME
ABOUT CHARLIE AGAIN,
AM I CLEAR?

25:10.042 --> 25:11.944
PLEASE GO NOW, PAUL.

25:28.427 --> 25:29.829
( door opens )

25:33.465 --> 25:35.001
( door closes )

25:37.203 --> 25:40.640
( theme music playing )
