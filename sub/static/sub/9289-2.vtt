00:13.995 --> 00:15.905
There's a situation, Mr. President.

00:15.997 --> 00:20.410
There's a nuclear device,
under terrorist control, that's on US soil.

00:20.502 --> 00:22.080
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.744
This bomb is going to go off today.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.920
Today's gonna be a very long day, and I don't
want my own people working against me.

00:29.219 --> 00:31.710
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

00:31.805 --> 00:34.047
What? I can't kiss my own wife?

00:34.141 --> 00:37.973
She's not your wife
for at least another 10 hours.

00:38.061 --> 00:40.184
When you asked for
a background on Reza Naiyeer,

00:40.272 --> 00:44.815
I was proofing a file on another individual.
Reza's name came up.

00:44.901 --> 00:48.566
There's a man named Syed Ali
with ties to terrorist organisations.

00:49.114 --> 00:51.237
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What are you doing here?

00:51.324 --> 00:55.488
- I just wanted to see you. I miss you.
- Dad, it's too hard for me right now.

00:55.579 --> 00:58.533
- Then why won't you...
- Every time I see you, I think of Mom.

00:58.999 --> 01:01.454
Are you a complete idiot?

01:01.543 --> 01:03.085
I don't like when he gets like this.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.874
I need a few minutes
with my daughter before I leave, OK?

01:05.964 --> 01:08.253
Did I not tell you to get outta here?

01:08.341 --> 01:10.417
Shut up! Shut up, Megan!

01:13.513 --> 01:15.173
What am I doing here, George?

01:15.265 --> 01:17.554
There's a rogue nuclear weapon
here in Los Angeles.

01:17.642 --> 01:21.557
- How close are you to IDing a prime suspect?
- The most promising one's Joseph Wald.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.137
Are there any witnesses
against Wald in his trial?

01:24.232 --> 01:27.352
Marshall Goren. Apparently
without him there's no case.

01:27.444 --> 01:29.353
You are Marshall Goren?

01:30.906 --> 01:32.732
No, Jack!

01:32.824 --> 01:35.529
- Are you out of your mind?
- You wanna find this bomb?

01:35.619 --> 01:38.288
This is what it's gonna take.
I'm gonna need a hacksaw.

01:49.174 --> 01:54.215
Quantico wants permission to relay the
nuclear threat to their mid-level tacticians.

01:54.304 --> 01:58.136
- How many people are we talking about?
- Between 600 and 700.

01:58.225 --> 02:01.226
Only if they assure
they can contain the information.

02:01.311 --> 02:04.810
I will confirm that
before I give them approval, sir.

02:04.898 --> 02:09.939
I want everyone to know that, besides
the threat of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles,

02:10.027 --> 02:13.563
I'm just as concerned with the dangers
of panic and mass hysteria.

02:13.657 --> 02:14.688
Absolutely.

02:14.783 --> 02:17.488
So where are we on everything else?

02:17.577 --> 02:21.112
Well, NSA is taking a two-pronged approach.

02:21.206 --> 02:25.500
They're trying to pick up a trail
on any known Second Wave terrorists,

02:25.585 --> 02:30.128
and they're also trying to source
stolen weapons-grade nuclear materials.

03:16.178 --> 03:19.297
Yes, call the rep,
tell them what the matter is, OK?

03:19.389 --> 03:23.469
Why can't she hang around?
I said I'd be back in a couple of minutes.

03:24.728 --> 03:25.890
Thank you. Yes...

03:25.979 --> 03:29.430
Hey, Kim. Stay there.
She's gonna be fine, OK?

03:29.524 --> 03:32.311
We'll work this out
in a couple of minutes. All right?

03:32.402 --> 03:34.691
Hey, Donny?

03:34.780 --> 03:36.322
Yeah.

03:36.406 --> 03:39.075
Yes, no... Uh... It's... it's...

03:39.785 --> 03:41.327
I know it's late.

03:41.411 --> 03:42.989
Why can't she...

03:43.079 --> 03:44.787
OK.

03:44.873 --> 03:48.787
Right, right. Yeah, do that.
Yes, I know. She's being a...

03:49.419 --> 03:50.997
No, no, no.

03:51.087 --> 03:53.757
No, everything's fine. It's fine.

03:54.299 --> 03:57.004
Yes, I know...

03:57.803 --> 04:00.210
Kim, take my keys. Get her away from here.

04:00.597 --> 04:02.139
Right.

04:05.352 --> 04:08.057
Tell them to wait until I get back, OK?

04:08.146 --> 04:09.938
I'll call you back.

04:15.070 --> 04:16.861
Come on!

04:23.537 --> 04:26.158
Kim! Stop the car. I will kill you.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.536
Stop the car! Do not do this, Kim.

04:29.334 --> 04:31.410
Do not do this.

04:44.099 --> 04:45.807
Star-Sat. Password, please.

04:45.892 --> 04:49.427
7073. I need to track
the location of my car, please.

04:54.818 --> 04:57.391
We'll drop you three blocks
from the salvage yard.

04:57.487 --> 05:00.607
- What about the car?
- Ready, with a tracker in the trunk.

05:00.699 --> 05:01.730
Good.

05:01.825 --> 05:04.363
We haven't seen Wald come in the yard yet.

05:04.453 --> 05:06.741
- What about his people?
- We're not sure.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.747
Any of these men look familiar?

05:10.834 --> 05:12.328
No.

05:13.753 --> 05:17.169
Yes, that's Eddie Grant.
He's one of Joe's main go-to guys.

05:17.257 --> 05:19.665
When I was undercover, we were friends.

05:19.760 --> 05:25.596
As soon as I'm in, I don't wanna see any of
our people. You keep everybody at a distance.

05:26.725 --> 05:29.216
You know any more about
the size of the bomb?

05:29.311 --> 05:31.387
Not yet.

05:50.123 --> 05:52.199
Sir, the press is asking questions.

05:52.292 --> 05:56.705
They know you cut your fishing trip short
and they'd like to know why.

05:59.424 --> 06:01.998
If you'd like, I can get Jenny to take care of it.

06:02.094 --> 06:05.462
- No, I'd better take care of it myself.
- Yes, sir.

06:06.264 --> 06:09.965
- Sir, we've got a lot to cover.
- I have to deal with the press.

06:10.060 --> 06:14.104
Sir, we have a serious situation
and taking time out to coddle the media...

06:14.189 --> 06:19.100
What you don't get, Eric, is that once the
rumour mill starts, we've got two problems.

06:19.194 --> 06:21.317
The last thing we need is mass hysteria.

06:34.793 --> 06:37.747
- Mason.
- George, it's Jack. Let me speak to Tony.

06:37.838 --> 06:40.210
- What do you need?
- Have you picked up Kim yet?

06:40.298 --> 06:43.999
Grothy just got to the house
a few minutes ago. Kim wasn't there.

06:44.094 --> 06:48.222
- What do you mean? Where is she?
- We don't know. She wasn't at the house.

06:48.306 --> 06:50.844
I told you to tell me when you knew anything.

06:50.934 --> 06:53.805
I was just picking up the phone. Relax, Jack.

06:53.895 --> 06:56.517
Don't tell me to relax, George.

06:56.606 --> 07:00.438
Grothy's gonna wait until Kim gets back.
Meantime, you hang in there.

07:00.527 --> 07:03.100
George, just find Kim, OK?

07:03.196 --> 07:07.360
That's what we're doin', Jack.
We're gonna find her and get her out of LA.

07:08.118 --> 07:10.407
- Trust me.
- OK. Thank you.

07:26.511 --> 07:30.639
- Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.
- Hey, sweetheart. It's your dad again.

07:30.724 --> 07:34.175
I can't tell you how important it is
that you leave Los Angeles.

07:34.269 --> 07:37.472
I'm sending a man over from my office.
His name is Roy Grothy.

07:37.564 --> 07:40.565
He's gonna pick you up
and take you over to Aunt Carol's.

07:40.650 --> 07:43.486
Honey, please, do this for me, OK?

07:43.570 --> 07:46.061
Call me back as soon as
you get these messages.

07:46.156 --> 07:48.445
I love you. Bye.

07:54.498 --> 07:57.582
Paula, have we gotten a Division update yet?

07:58.502 --> 08:03.460
Uh, yeah. Tony, shouldn't we
be working from outside LA?

08:03.548 --> 08:04.627
Why?

08:04.716 --> 08:08.548
If there's a nuclear bomb
somewhere in the city...

08:08.637 --> 08:12.504
Try to tune it out, Paula.
You never know how good the intel is.

08:16.770 --> 08:20.933
Almeida, we have a lead. Just caught
a couple of coyotes at the border.

08:21.024 --> 08:24.060
- Who were they bringing in?
- Not who, what.

08:24.152 --> 08:26.524
Michelle, you want to pull it up?

08:26.613 --> 08:28.736
Two forged Middle Eastern passports.

08:28.824 --> 08:32.986
The markings on the paper conform to
a process used by some of our suspects.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.494
They were headed for Culver City.
Let's get somebody over there.

08:36.581 --> 08:38.657
- Who?
- Who's in the area?

08:38.750 --> 08:42.368
- The only one in that section is Roy Grothy.
- Good. Send him.

08:42.462 --> 08:44.585
- George...
- What?

08:44.673 --> 08:49.216
- That's who we sent to pick up Kim Bauer.
- He's idling over there. Kim's not around.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.628
We promised Jack we'd take care of her.

08:51.721 --> 08:57.178
Fine. We'll send a gofer until he gets back.
In the meantime, don't lose this window.

09:39.352 --> 09:41.060
- Hey, cowboy.
- Can I help you?

09:41.146 --> 09:43.304
- I'm looking for Joe.
- Joe?

09:43.398 --> 09:45.391
Joseph Wald.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.188
Sorry, man. I think you got the wrong place.

09:48.278 --> 09:51.647
Hey, cowboy. I ain't got a whole lot of time.

09:51.740 --> 09:55.323
Why don't you tell Joe Jack's back in town,
see what he says?

09:55.410 --> 09:57.699
Why don't I tell him, Jack?

10:00.457 --> 10:05.997
Why don't I tell Joe Jack Roush is here?
He'd love to see the guy that put him in jail.

10:07.172 --> 10:12.676
Hey, Eddie. I just came to square things up
with Joe. You know I didn't put him in jail.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.467
Sure you didn't.

10:20.685 --> 10:23.141
Get the back room ready.

10:23.438 --> 10:27.388
Damm it, Eddie.
I got something I need to show Joe.

10:27.484 --> 10:30.189
The only thing he's gonna
wanna see is you... dead.

10:30.278 --> 10:32.567
What about Marshall Goren?

10:33.448 --> 10:34.907
What about him?

10:34.991 --> 10:40.412
Word on the street is that he turned
state's evidence, gonna put Joe away for life.

10:40.705 --> 10:43.161
Go on, Eddie. Look in my bag.

10:47.337 --> 10:50.706
- What for, Jack?
- Think of it as a present for Joe.

10:51.258 --> 10:54.377
I told you, I wanted to
square things up with him.

11:00.142 --> 11:02.218
Frank, give me that bag.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.896
Just open it.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.449
What the hell, Jack.

11:27.127 --> 11:30.959
I don't think you gotta worry
about Goren testifying any more.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.356
Jack's back.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.744
Fortunately for me
the vice president arrived when he did.

12:12.839 --> 12:16.006
We were both running out of small talk.

12:16.927 --> 12:18.670
Mr. President?

12:19.679 --> 12:21.921
- Mr. President?
- Jane.

12:22.015 --> 12:26.807
We were told you were going fishing this
morning. What brought you back so early?

12:26.895 --> 12:32.020
I already caught my quota. My conservation
policy is coming back to haunt me.

12:33.276 --> 12:37.191
- Mr. President...
- Look, let's not have so much fun all at once.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.112
We're here for a couple of days.
I'll talk to you guys later.

12:49.251 --> 12:53.498
- OK, what did Wieland want?
- I think he's putting it together, sir.

12:53.588 --> 12:57.088
How can he? I just found out myself
less than an hour ago.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.713
I'm sure he doesn't know the details,

12:59.803 --> 13:02.923
but Wieland knows everyone
and they all owe him.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.174
OK... Keep your eye on him for now.

13:08.270 --> 13:12.599
If we go out of our way to put off the press,
they'll know something's up.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.971
I agree.

13:14.985 --> 13:17.273
- I have to get back to the OC.
- OK.

13:31.209 --> 13:33.285
What's this?

13:35.130 --> 13:38.914
- My head hurts.
- I know, Megan. We'll be there real soon.

13:39.009 --> 13:42.129
- Where are we going?
- The police station.

13:44.306 --> 13:46.382
You know what?

13:48.393 --> 13:50.967
We're gonna go down this alley.

14:02.616 --> 14:05.189
Do something, Kim.
Make him go away, please.

14:20.509 --> 14:24.720
Where are you going with my daughter, Kim?
Huh? Where you gonna go?

14:26.723 --> 14:29.973
Megan, honey, get out of the car.
Come to Daddy.

14:38.985 --> 14:41.274
Do something.

14:44.449 --> 14:46.525
Get out of the car.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.783
Hurry!

14:57.796 --> 14:59.753
Move! Move, move, move, move.

15:05.637 --> 15:06.835
Kim!

15:17.524 --> 15:19.600
Megan!

15:22.237 --> 15:24.313
Megan, it's Daddy.

15:26.283 --> 15:30.411
Listen to me, pal. Kim is gonna hurt you.

15:31.413 --> 15:34.996
Megan, just call out to Daddy, OK?
I'll come get you.

15:39.129 --> 15:41.205
Megan!

15:42.424 --> 15:43.170
Megan!

15:52.851 --> 15:58.272
Don't get that stuff tangled. We won't have
time to separate them once we get there.

16:00.525 --> 16:03.775
- Who's that?
- That's Jack.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.567
Are you outta your mind
bringing him here today?

16:06.656 --> 16:09.326
He used to work with us, Dave.

16:10.660 --> 16:13.151
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Eddie?

16:13.246 --> 16:18.454
I used to work for Joe. I just did a nickel for
him up in Gainesville. That's what it means.

16:18.543 --> 16:20.619
Oh-oh. Is that a fact?

16:21.463 --> 16:25.295
And he happens to show up today
of all days? I'm not buying this, Eddie.

16:25.383 --> 16:28.301
He did a solid for Joe.
He took care of Goren, Dave.

16:28.386 --> 16:31.506
- Well, if he can get to Goren, he must be...
- Hey, Eddie.

16:31.598 --> 16:35.181
Look, man, I just need to speak to Joe, OK?
Then I'm outta here.

16:35.268 --> 16:40.096
- I hear you, Jack.
- If he's stayin', I'm checkin' him out.

16:40.190 --> 16:44.733
- Don't you have something to do, Dave?
- I'll bird-dog his records in two minutes.

16:44.820 --> 16:50.027
Don't you think it's worth two minutes
considering what's about to happen?

16:50.117 --> 16:52.193
Check it out.

16:56.164 --> 16:58.702
- Have a seat, Jack.
- OK.

17:03.964 --> 17:08.589
- Jack what?
- Roush. R-o-u-s-h.

17:14.933 --> 17:18.634
He's in. They just went online.
They're checking Jack's background.

17:18.728 --> 17:21.301
Already?
The network addresses aren't ready.

17:21.397 --> 17:25.478
Better send it to me now. Tony, did you
backfill those Gainesville end dates?

17:25.569 --> 17:28.819
- Not yet.
- I need them now. They're looking for it.

17:28.905 --> 17:32.606
- These guys don't waste time.
- I can't believe they got in so quickly.

17:32.701 --> 17:35.737
- You want me to stuff some data in?
- They want this now.

17:35.829 --> 17:39.696
I'm gonna forge their server portal
and hope they don't look too closely.

17:44.963 --> 17:48.249
I'm not finding any
release documents on this guy.

17:48.341 --> 17:50.548
What does that mean, Dave?

17:50.635 --> 17:53.553
That means he's lying. That's what it means.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.389
Keep lookin'.

18:04.274 --> 18:08.272
Listen, Jack, if this time you did
in Gainesville doesn't check out,

18:08.361 --> 18:10.817
I won't let you walk outta here.

18:10.906 --> 18:13.397
It's gonna check out, Eddie.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.001
Anything?

18:31.093 --> 18:33.169
No.

18:38.391 --> 18:39.340
Come on.

18:39.434 --> 18:42.803
- Tony, I need it.
- OK, I got it. Hold on, hold on.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.431
It's still looking.

19:02.457 --> 19:05.375
Wait a second. I think I found it.

19:09.673 --> 19:14.714
Yeah, here it is. It just took a little longer
to come up than I thought it would.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.139
Told you it would check out.

19:30.402 --> 19:33.154
You almost made me shoot a friend, Dave.

19:35.699 --> 19:39.993
I'm sorry about that, Jack.
You still got that '64 Mustang?

19:42.122 --> 19:44.411
No, the lawyers got that.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.753
Eric.

20:01.308 --> 20:05.056
Are we narrowing things down at all?
I mean, are we making any headway?

20:05.145 --> 20:08.015
- It's too soon to tell.
- Too soon?

20:08.106 --> 20:11.890
Aren't we assuming that this bomb
could go off at any moment?

20:11.985 --> 20:16.279
What can I say? I've never been sanguine
about our chances of stopping it.

20:16.364 --> 20:19.069
Not with just a few hours' warning.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.911
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm not giving up, sir.

20:22.996 --> 20:26.946
Every protocol is being followed,
every resource tapped.

20:27.042 --> 20:33.460
But I would give serious thought to your plan
of action if in fact we have a detonation.

20:34.925 --> 20:39.670
I still feel a discussion with the Pentagon
this morning is in order.

20:41.348 --> 20:43.886
Fine. Thanks, Eric.

20:43.975 --> 20:45.007
Yes, sir.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.561
Come in.

20:57.447 --> 21:00.781
I just spoke with Jenny.
I'm afraid we have a problem.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.156
- What now?
- Ron Wieland.

21:03.245 --> 21:08.322
He's convinced the network to give him
a 10-minute live report today at noon.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.448
For what?

21:09.543 --> 21:14.086
He's heard the alert condition has changed
and that you are managing a situation.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.081
Damm it.

21:16.174 --> 21:20.124
- He's going live based on what?
- Jenny doesn't know, sir.

21:20.220 --> 21:25.012
But I'm assuming that he will avoid the facts
and present the rumour.

21:28.854 --> 21:34.192
- I'm sorry, Lynne. I'm not mad at you.
- There's no need to apologise, sir.

21:34.276 --> 21:37.193
How would you like to proceed?

21:40.657 --> 21:44.489
Set up a private interview
in 10 minutes with Mr. Wieland.

21:44.578 --> 21:47.614
- The condition is no one's to know.
- Yes, sir.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.413
And, Lynne...

21:51.168 --> 21:53.244
Get Armus over here.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.090
Yes, sir.

22:15.150 --> 22:17.771
Hey, man. How you doing?

22:17.861 --> 22:20.897
- Get the hell outta here.
- I just wanted to bum a smoke.

22:20.989 --> 22:23.694
I don't smoke, so get out.

22:25.869 --> 22:29.119
You're packing the fuses a little tight, sport.

22:29.206 --> 22:31.282
What did you say?

22:32.626 --> 22:35.117
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

22:35.212 --> 22:38.462
- Makin' friends, Jack?
- The guy's a moron.

22:38.548 --> 22:42.048
- What did Joe say?
- Joe's busy. Maybe tomorrow, bro.

22:42.135 --> 22:44.258
I just need to see him for five minutes.

22:44.346 --> 22:48.889
We got this thing going down today, Jack,
so swing by tomorrow around four.

22:51.728 --> 22:53.804
Yeah, OK. That's cool.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.230
It's good to see you, man.

23:02.405 --> 23:03.900
Good luck.

23:08.286 --> 23:10.362
It's time, Dave.

23:37.190 --> 23:39.266
- Mason.
- George, it's me.

23:39.359 --> 23:43.571
- Did you get to Wald yet?
- Not yet. His crew are shutting me out.

23:43.655 --> 23:46.276
- George, you gotta pick these guys up.
- Why?

23:46.366 --> 23:48.738
They're packing charges. They're involved.

23:48.827 --> 23:51.744
If we pick 'em up, are they
gonna lead us to Wald in time?

23:51.830 --> 23:52.861
I don't know.

23:52.956 --> 23:58.911
Well, stick with them until they do. NSA just
upgraded his probable role in today's threat.

23:59.004 --> 24:02.539
Put him just a click away
from the Second Wave terrorists.

24:02.632 --> 24:05.123
OK, I'll try and figure something out.

24:05.927 --> 24:07.885
Damm it.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.423
- Mr. Mason?
- Yeah.

25:28.510 --> 25:31.427
I've opened up that socket
to Division you asked for.

25:31.513 --> 25:33.589
Thank you.

26:56.556 --> 26:58.632
George, where are you going?

26:59.059 --> 27:01.348
- Bakersfield.
- What for?

27:02.229 --> 27:06.357
Following up on a lead. We're short-handed
today so I gotta cover it myself.

27:06.441 --> 27:10.106
- Peter's assigned to Bakersfield.
- I put him on something else.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.362
- What?
- I don't have to tell you that.

27:13.448 --> 27:16.200
Well, I guess I disagree.

27:16.284 --> 27:20.412
I mean, if you're just trying
to get outside the blast radius...

27:24.126 --> 27:26.747
Who the hell do you think you are?

27:26.837 --> 27:30.040
- Do you have access to my information?
- No, George, I don't.

27:30.132 --> 27:33.168
Then keep your mouth shut and do your job.

28:02.038 --> 28:03.912
Get down!

28:14.217 --> 28:16.376
- I feel funny.
- What's wrong?

28:16.470 --> 28:18.711
- My head hurts.
- Where?

28:18.805 --> 28:20.881
Right there.

28:22.017 --> 28:25.433
- Is that where you hit your head?
- I think so.

28:28.023 --> 28:31.606
Honey, we can't stay here. I need to
make a phone call. You can rest then.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.152
- No!
- Why not?

28:33.236 --> 28:37.815
- I can't. My head really hurts...
- It's just over there. It'll be really quick.

28:37.908 --> 28:39.984
Please, for me. You can do it.

28:40.076 --> 28:43.280
- No, I can't. I don't feel good.
- OK, listen, listen. Shh...

28:43.371 --> 28:45.660
We have to stay quiet, Megan.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.034
What do you wanna do? Stay here? Yeah?

28:50.128 --> 28:53.248
OK. But you have to wait.
You promise you'll stay here?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.416
You promise?

28:56.259 --> 29:00.043
We're gonna put you in these boxes.
I'll be right back.

29:02.891 --> 29:05.596
- I don't want you moving.
- I won't.

29:05.685 --> 29:09.351
I'm gonna be really quick.
Please, just don't go anywhere.

29:09.439 --> 29:11.764
I'll be right back.

29:15.737 --> 29:18.524
- This is Burton.
- Hi, it's Kate Warner.

29:18.615 --> 29:21.818
- Did you get something for me?
- No, I couldn't get his wallet.

29:21.910 --> 29:26.453
There are only a few things we can use
to check out his connection to this guy Ali.

29:26.540 --> 29:30.869
- Actually, a passport would be ideal.
- I don't think he carries that around.

29:30.961 --> 29:36.203
It's gotta be around somewhere.
Check his briefcase. Look in his car.

29:36.299 --> 29:40.297
- Ralph, I can't just steal his passport.
- You won't have to.

29:40.387 --> 29:46.223
Just write down the countries that have been
stamped for entry over the last six months.

29:46.309 --> 29:47.768
Let me know, OK?

31:29.913 --> 31:31.989
Kate!

31:39.256 --> 31:41.960
- What are you doing?
- I, uh...

31:42.050 --> 31:46.095
Craig said more vans were coming
and they needed the space.

31:46.179 --> 31:51.137
- How you gonna drive it without the key?
- I was looking for it.

31:51.226 --> 31:54.429
- Well, why didn't you call me?
- You were busy.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.430
I'm running for strawberries.
When I come back, I'll park on the other side.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.602
Great.

32:37.856 --> 32:40.014
What are you still doing here?

32:40.108 --> 32:43.726
- My car won't start.
- Well, take a cab. Beat it.

32:46.782 --> 32:49.901
You need to learn to mind your own business.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.407
- Hey, Eddie.
- What?

32:53.497 --> 32:55.785
I hope this job isn't too important.

32:55.874 --> 33:00.085
Junior here packed your fuses too tight.
There's no way it'll blow. He's a joke.

33:03.965 --> 33:06.041
See what I'm telling ya?

33:09.221 --> 33:11.297
Agh!

33:13.308 --> 33:14.506
Jack!

33:19.773 --> 33:23.106
It's broken. He just broke my ankle.

33:26.655 --> 33:28.579
You broke his damn ankle, Jack.

33:28.779 --> 33:31.696
He shouldn't have been
playing with adults.

33:59.438 --> 34:03.305
This is the 911 emergency operator.
Please stay on the line.

34:08.737 --> 34:13.484
Who are you calling, Kim? The police are
looking for you for kidnapping my daughter.

34:13.577 --> 34:15.652
- Let go of me.
- All right. OK.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.828
I'm sorry.

34:18.915 --> 34:21.869
I'm not gonna hurt Megan. I promise.

34:23.670 --> 34:29.791
I know it was wrong of me to push Carla,
but I have been under a lot of pressure lately.

34:29.885 --> 34:31.960
You don't understand.

34:33.889 --> 34:37.092
I'm not a bad person. OK?

34:38.851 --> 34:44.606
You were right to take Megan away from that
situation. I would have done the same thing.

34:44.690 --> 34:48.391
But, listen... I'm her father, OK?

34:49.737 --> 34:54.732
I need to apologise to her and tell her
that she doesn't have to be afraid of me.

34:58.914 --> 35:01.120
You understand that, right?

35:02.209 --> 35:04.332
Yeah.

35:06.630 --> 35:09.121
Where is she?

35:15.180 --> 35:20.008
Why don't you go home and talk to Carla?
If it's OK with her, I'll bring back Megan.

35:20.102 --> 35:23.056
- You don't tell me what to do, OK?
- I'm not...

35:23.146 --> 35:26.598
You don't tell me what to do.
Tell me where my daughter is!

36:00.517 --> 36:03.388
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim!

36:03.478 --> 36:04.854
Tell me!

36:18.326 --> 36:21.909
And the last entry is Frankfurt, May 19th.

36:21.997 --> 36:25.330
- Great. That's a big help.
- So what does that tell us?

36:25.417 --> 36:31.372
We'll compare Reza's travel dates with Syed
Ali's. See if we can find a terrorist connection.

36:31.465 --> 36:35.083
Um... OK. Yes, that would be great.
Thank you.

36:36.511 --> 36:37.922
There's the bride.

36:38.013 --> 36:42.093
Reza's parents are coming in early,
so I called Brent's and I ordered lunch.

36:42.184 --> 36:45.469
- Good. I'll pick it up.
- OK. Thank you.

36:45.562 --> 36:48.729
I finally feel like everything is under control.

36:51.401 --> 36:54.319
- Kate...
- What?

36:57.199 --> 37:00.698
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

37:00.786 --> 37:02.908
For everything.

37:02.996 --> 37:06.330
For being the maid of honour,
for helping me with the wedding,

37:06.416 --> 37:09.619
for... being my big sister.

37:10.587 --> 37:13.339
- Marie...
- I love you.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.417
Oh, honey.

37:16.510 --> 37:18.633
Oh, I love you too.

37:21.723 --> 37:23.799
Now, get to work.

37:40.534 --> 37:42.989
- Ron.
- Mr. President.

37:43.078 --> 37:45.367
Good to see you. Come in.

37:47.165 --> 37:50.250
Please, sit down. Can I offer you anything?

37:50.335 --> 37:52.624
Oh, no, thank you, sir.

37:57.551 --> 38:01.002
I understand you're about
to go live with a story today.

38:01.096 --> 38:03.302
Just what is it you think is going on?

38:03.390 --> 38:08.431
I think the alert condition has been elevated
and you don't want us to know that, sir.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.596
You think?

38:10.689 --> 38:14.307
Do you want me to tell you my sources?
You know I can't do that.

38:16.611 --> 38:19.482
You're barking up the wrong tree, Ron.

38:19.573 --> 38:24.400
I don't recall the last time a journalist
got a private interview with the president

38:24.494 --> 38:26.570
on a few minutes' notice.

38:26.663 --> 38:31.408
So... my 22 years in the business
tells me I'm barking up the right tree.

38:33.462 --> 38:35.538
I tell you what, Ron.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.559
There's gonna be a briefing tomorrow.

38:37.759 --> 38:40.209
If you want a 30-minute jump,
I can arrange it.

38:40.302 --> 38:42.378
Why are you horse-trading with me?

38:42.471 --> 38:46.171
Because if you go live with a story
about unsubstantiated threats,

38:46.266 --> 38:49.018
you will cause mass hysteria.

38:49.102 --> 38:51.580
That could be worse
than the threat itself.

38:51.780 --> 38:53.314
So there is a threat.

38:53.398 --> 38:56.518
Ron... we get them every day.

38:58.653 --> 39:00.563
So you want me to sit on this,

39:00.655 --> 39:05.234
even though it's my professional right
to take what I've got on the air?

39:08.330 --> 39:10.737
Ron, you know me.

39:10.832 --> 39:15.541
I've been more forthcoming with the press
and public than any politician you know.

39:15.629 --> 39:21.252
So when I ask you for a favour, I do it in the
spirit of what's best for the American people.

39:27.891 --> 39:30.263
- Let me think about it.
- Fair enough.

39:31.728 --> 39:34.515
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Ron.

39:56.211 --> 39:58.500
- Armus.
- Yes, sir.

39:59.297 --> 40:03.627
- I think we're gonna have to deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

40:10.267 --> 40:15.641
Mr. Wieland, I'm Richard Armus. I'm with
the president's Secret Service Blue Unit.

40:15.730 --> 40:19.064
There's something the president
wants you to see before you go.

40:19.151 --> 40:22.733
- It won't take more than a few minutes.
- Let go of my arm.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.543
You haven't changed much, have you, Jack?

40:43.508 --> 40:48.004
- What's your point?
- I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.

40:50.432 --> 40:52.757
I'm looking for work.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.184
This isn't a job. You're gonna
do this for nothing, Jack.

40:56.271 --> 40:58.892
My price is a thousand a day.

40:58.982 --> 41:03.146
Well, Jack, I'd say you owe me a bit more
than that for what you did to Dave.

41:03.236 --> 41:05.727
You do this, I don't tell Joe.

41:05.822 --> 41:10.650
You don't do it, you'll be too busy
lookin' over your shoulder to find work.

41:13.789 --> 41:16.743
- What's the job?
- You're gonna like it.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.929
Megan...

41:33.016 --> 41:35.305
Megan. Megan!

41:36.228 --> 41:38.516
Megan! Megan!

41:40.482 --> 41:42.558
Megan!

41:49.407 --> 41:52.029
No! Megan! No!

41:53.120 --> 41:54.993
Megan!

41:56.206 --> 41:58.080
Megan!

42:08.009 --> 42:10.631
Megan! Megan!

42:14.474 --> 42:17.808
Yeah, we're right on schedule.

42:17.894 --> 42:22.307
We'll talk to you in about an hour.
All right, that's great. Rock out.

42:23.442 --> 42:26.063
- Where are we goin'?
- West LA.

42:26.153 --> 42:29.356
- What are we doin'?
- A conversion.

42:30.157 --> 42:31.402
What do you mean?

42:31.491 --> 42:35.785
Well, today we're turning
a government building into a cemetery.

42:36.663 --> 42:40.114
- Which building?
- A branch that's been dogging us for years.

42:40.208 --> 42:44.372
They call it the LA Counter Terrorist Unit -
the CTU.

42:46.381 --> 42:48.457
