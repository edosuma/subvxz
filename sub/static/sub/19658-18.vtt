00:00.167 --> 00:01.686
♪♪

00:01.694 --> 00:04.304
Listen up, people.
Here's what we know so far.

00:04.382 --> 00:08.203
J'Son, aka my jerk of a dad,
has five Centurion helmets.

00:08.303 --> 00:10.828
Incredibly powerful objects
in the wrong hands...

00:10.929 --> 00:12.795
AKA my dad's hands...

00:12.843 --> 00:14.687
could be used
to take over the galaxy.

00:14.804 --> 00:17.171
We need to find
our friend Adam Warlock,

00:17.293 --> 00:20.109
the only being who could stand up
to the power of those helmets.

00:20.265 --> 00:21.695
And how do we do that, Quill?

00:21.778 --> 00:24.632
It ain't like the guy left us
a krutackin' forwarding address.

00:24.789 --> 00:25.945
Good point, Rocket.

00:26.054 --> 00:27.776
But we do know people
who've mentioned myths

00:27.823 --> 00:29.716
from their home worlds
about Warlock.

00:30.304 --> 00:34.257
One of them, unfortunately, no longer has
his original home world to investigate.

00:36.101 --> 00:37.945
I am Groot.

00:38.557 --> 00:41.117
Which leaves us with one last option.

00:44.023 --> 00:46.078
That's a stretch even for you, Quill.

00:46.170 --> 00:50.698
If Drax knew something about how to contact
Warlock, why not mention it before?

00:51.643 --> 00:54.476
Because, Gamora,
I did not wish to speak of it.

00:54.581 --> 00:58.093
You've been holding out on us,
ya big, green cue ball? Spill!

00:58.281 --> 01:00.070
But I have no liquid to spill.

01:00.218 --> 01:02.570
It's a metaphor, dummy!

01:02.665 --> 01:05.812
It means tell us what you know
before I blast it outta ya!

01:06.007 --> 01:08.920
It will take more than feeble
threats to get me to admit

01:08.968 --> 01:11.617
that my planet has a temple
that, according to legend,

01:11.694 --> 01:14.461
contains a beacon
that can summon the Warlock.

01:15.371 --> 01:17.304
O-kay.

01:17.363 --> 01:20.711
So, I'm thinking we set a course
for Drax's home world now.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.030
Absolutely not.

01:22.078 --> 01:24.671
I refuse to return there
under any circumstance!

01:24.781 --> 01:27.054
Nor will I discuss the matter
any further!

01:27.195 --> 01:28.531
But...

01:28.611 --> 01:31.545
Hey! I worked hard on that!

01:34.242 --> 01:38.531
Okay. What say we just back off and
soothe that stress with a little tuneage?

01:38.856 --> 01:41.367
<i>♪ Love's a roller coaster... ♪</i>

01:41.468 --> 01:43.336
These words make no sense.

01:43.474 --> 01:45.132
How can love be a roller coaster

01:45.180 --> 01:47.398
when one can neither see,
nor touch it?

01:47.699 --> 01:50.679
It's a song, Drax.
The lyrics don't matter,

01:50.802 --> 01:52.539
as long as it swings, baby.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.479
Really? You're gonna go
with another metaphor?

01:55.835 --> 01:57.383
You just have to crank it up

01:57.430 --> 01:59.396
and tune out the rest of the world.

01:59.444 --> 02:01.452
Okay, set a course
for Drax's home world.

02:02.030 --> 02:04.101
What?! What did you say?!

02:04.273 --> 02:05.848
I am Groot.

02:06.093 --> 02:09.585
Of course it's dishonest.
That's why it'll work.

02:26.738 --> 02:29.839
Quill! What have you done?

02:30.720 --> 02:32.181
You deceived me!

02:32.275 --> 02:35.505
I would recognize
my home planet's scent anywhere!

02:35.775 --> 02:36.946
I'm sorry, man.

02:36.981 --> 02:39.749
I didn't wanna lie,
but the universe...

02:39.845 --> 02:41.917
kind of in mortal danger right now.

02:42.095 --> 02:45.103
And look, we didn't think
you'd come if we told the truth.

02:45.368 --> 02:47.157
You are correct.

02:47.829 --> 02:51.548
There's a lot more at stake than
you not wanting to face your past.

02:58.184 --> 03:01.395
Behold, the
Temple of the Destroyer!

03:01.778 --> 03:03.606
Everybody else just seeing a rock wall?

03:03.879 --> 03:05.875
The temple lies beyond the rock wall.

03:06.082 --> 03:10.479
Only one can pass through it to the
sacred space within... the Destroyer.

03:10.515 --> 03:12.606
- Imposter!
- Huh?

03:12.754 --> 03:14.395
You are not the Destroyer.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.340
I am the Destroyer.

03:22.661 --> 03:27.834
<font color=#FF00FF>*MARVEL'S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY*</font>

03:32.395 --> 03:35.288
You should never have returned,
Drax!

03:41.169 --> 03:43.122
Xeron, cease this attack.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.856
I mean you no harm.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.927
That makes one of us!

03:48.757 --> 03:51.513
You think you can
bribe me with this delicacy?

03:51.615 --> 03:53.654
It is not even cooked!

03:53.847 --> 03:55.917
I'll show ya cooked!

03:57.364 --> 03:58.583
Do not interfere!

03:58.647 --> 04:00.713
This is my fight and mine alone!

04:01.095 --> 04:04.029
For once we agree,
Drax the Traitor.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.266
Only a coward lets others
fight their battles.

04:07.515 --> 04:12.061
Well, that's just too bad, lady, 'cause
we're the Guardians, and we stick together!

04:12.475 --> 04:16.764
What do your adhesive properties
have to do with this fight?

04:16.904 --> 04:19.779
Oh, great. Another of
the metaphorically challenged.

04:23.039 --> 04:24.640
That's it!

04:28.155 --> 04:29.888
I am Groot!

04:41.578 --> 04:46.140
You may have secured victory, Drax,
but you did so without honor.

04:46.265 --> 04:49.827
Which is why I am
the one true Destroyer.

04:50.016 --> 04:51.950
Isn't that more of a Drax thing?

04:53.538 --> 04:57.327
He insults our sacred traditions
by bearing that title.

04:57.530 --> 05:01.811
And to return now, of all times,
with the Warlock upon us.

05:01.897 --> 05:03.722
So you know about Warlock.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.858
It is my sworn duty.

05:06.046 --> 05:09.225
When the Warlock returns, the
Destroyer must enter the temple

05:09.287 --> 05:11.905
to summon him
with the sacred beacon,

05:12.132 --> 05:14.054
and destroy him.

05:14.343 --> 05:17.970
Okay, you had me at "summon,"
then you lost me at "destroy."

05:18.171 --> 05:21.952
Xeron, there is much we must
discuss in regard to the Warlock.

05:22.112 --> 05:25.632
I have nothing to discuss with a heretic
who turned his back on his duty

05:25.741 --> 05:27.646
to pursue fame and fortune.

05:27.843 --> 05:29.640
That is not true!

05:29.817 --> 05:31.617
I did it for love.

05:33.874 --> 05:37.577
<i>There was a time when being crowned
Destroyer meant everything to me.</i>

05:37.758 --> 05:42.186
<i>Xeron and I trained together, competing
for this highest honor among our people.</i>

05:45.897 --> 05:49.647
<i>Eventually, the time came when I
was given what I desired most.</i>

05:50.122 --> 05:52.358
<i>I became Drax the Destroyer.</i>

05:59.490 --> 06:01.623
<i>Though fate had other plans for me.</i>

06:10.085 --> 06:12.858
<i>I knew the Destroyer
was forbidden to have a family,</i>

06:13.100 --> 06:15.594
<i>but I could not deny
my feelings for Ovette.</i>

06:18.366 --> 06:21.421
So we fled our home,
never to return.

06:21.663 --> 06:24.077
You swore an oath, Drax.

06:24.241 --> 06:27.960
The bonds of friends and
family make you weak.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.809
The Destroyer walks alone.

06:31.147 --> 06:34.038
And I have.
My wife and daughter...

06:34.421 --> 06:37.600
they perished at the hands of
Thanos and his puppet, Ronan.

06:37.772 --> 06:41.140
I am vexed that my feelings for
them can bring such happiness

06:41.335 --> 06:43.210
and also such pain.

06:43.921 --> 06:47.530
Well, maybe because love
is like a roller coaster?

06:48.171 --> 06:50.819
Metaphor.
I do not understand it,

06:50.968 --> 06:52.917
but I have learned to identify it.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.069
I do not care
for your meaningless words.

06:56.233 --> 06:59.882
I became Destroyer in your
absence, but only by default.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.968
I could never live up to your legacy.

07:05.749 --> 07:08.881
Only the true
Destroyer can enter the temple.

07:09.499 --> 07:12.272
Then perhaps, for all my sins,

07:12.632 --> 07:14.921
<i>I</i> am still the true Destroyer?

07:17.804 --> 07:19.091
Just once,

07:19.126 --> 07:21.421
couldn't these
mystic mumbo jumbo prophecies

07:21.499 --> 07:23.452
come with an instruction manual?

07:23.710 --> 07:25.374
The instructions are clear.

07:25.475 --> 07:29.818
We must battle to the finish so the
true Destroyer may be revealed.

07:30.974 --> 07:34.178
No! Do not interfere!
This is my fight!

07:48.832 --> 07:50.531
Drax!

07:54.862 --> 07:57.511
We are inside
the Temple of the Destroyer.

07:57.697 --> 07:59.081
Unacceptable.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.417
Only one can enter the temple.

08:01.530 --> 08:03.573
It is written.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.080
And yet there are two.

08:06.323 --> 08:10.408
Which means someone here
does not belong.

08:11.683 --> 08:14.179
I am Groot.

08:17.217 --> 08:19.003
Heed me.

08:19.051 --> 08:24.187
I am the Sphinx,
and this is my test.

08:24.434 --> 08:27.661
The best answer destroys the question.

08:27.976 --> 08:30.482
What walks on four legs
n the morning,

08:30.630 --> 08:33.621
two legs at midday,

08:33.828 --> 08:35.341
and three in the evening?

08:35.578 --> 08:37.280
Oh, it's a riddle.

08:37.592 --> 08:40.133
Not just a
riddle, a metaphor.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.486
They're flarged.

08:41.804 --> 08:42.897
It is a trial.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.727
The temple seeks to find
the true Destroyer.

08:46.180 --> 08:47.829
You, Sphinx,

08:48.390 --> 08:52.226
bring me this many-limbed
creature, and I will dispatch it.

08:52.527 --> 08:54.577
I do not think there is a creature.

08:55.063 --> 08:56.796
It sounds more like a metaphor.

08:57.116 --> 08:59.788
Enough with your strange words!
I will handle this!

09:10.279 --> 09:13.190
All you have done is trigger a trap!

09:14.416 --> 09:17.984
A trap that will end us both!

09:20.170 --> 09:21.684
Xeron!

09:38.403 --> 09:40.004
Do not touch me!

09:40.309 --> 09:41.809
Did I do something wrong?

09:41.871 --> 09:43.363
You interfered.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.495
Have you forgotten our ways completely?

09:45.577 --> 09:47.942
The Destroyer walks alone!

09:48.100 --> 09:50.457
That has not been my experience.

09:50.615 --> 09:52.918
Friends and allies
have helped me in the past.

09:53.145 --> 09:56.273
Although, clearly, they will
not help me solve this riddle.

09:56.606 --> 09:59.145
"It walks on four legs in the morning,

09:59.329 --> 10:02.059
two at midday,
and three in the evening."

10:02.233 --> 10:04.200
What creature has such attributes?

10:04.329 --> 10:07.363
Oh, hang on. I remember this
one from when I was a kid.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.773
It's man!

10:08.958 --> 10:12.016
Because he starts out crawling
as an infant... four legs.

10:12.370 --> 10:13.703
Then walks on two.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.367
Then needs a cane in old age...
three legs.

10:16.945 --> 10:19.375
I am Groot.

10:19.528 --> 10:22.969
Yeah. I'll never get
humie biology either, bud.

10:29.742 --> 10:34.000
Look! The Sphinx must have
seen my warrior spirit!

10:34.080 --> 10:36.703
Or perhaps it is because
I destroyed the trap?

10:43.902 --> 10:45.977
Which path do we take now?

10:46.133 --> 10:49.323
Until I am
measured I am not known,

10:49.534 --> 10:53.198
yet how you miss me
when I have flown.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.385
What am I?

10:55.644 --> 10:57.081
A new metaphor.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.800
Enough games!

10:58.995 --> 11:02.191
I am the Destroyer,
and the Destroyer acts!

11:02.316 --> 11:04.378
No, Xeron! Wait!

11:17.619 --> 11:19.775
Quill, "measured," "flown"...

11:19.939 --> 11:21.346
The answer is time.

11:21.519 --> 11:25.729
Great. So which of these squiggles
means "time" in Drax-ese?

11:26.378 --> 11:30.268
<i>Drax, you're running out
of</i> time <i> to solve this riddle!</i>

11:30.380 --> 11:33.044
How do you know
I'm trying to solve a riddle?

11:33.218 --> 11:35.416
Wait.
Are you <i> inside</i> the temple?

11:35.588 --> 11:36.697
Yeah.

11:36.791 --> 11:38.221
No. You must go.

11:38.283 --> 11:39.900
You are not permitted to be here!

11:40.018 --> 11:42.611
Drax, who are you speaking to?

11:42.721 --> 11:45.424
I am speaking to... myself.

11:45.476 --> 11:47.713
We are running out of time.

11:48.126 --> 11:49.213
Time!

11:49.346 --> 11:51.486
Run to the symbol of time!

12:07.504 --> 12:09.114
Whoo-hoo!

12:09.268 --> 12:11.235
Why run when you can fly?

12:13.970 --> 12:17.087
So this is why
you have been winning, Drax.

12:17.295 --> 12:18.915
You were cheating!

12:19.014 --> 12:21.298
Technically,
we were the ones cheating.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.199
Oh, and you're welcome.

12:23.556 --> 12:25.368
But you are not!

12:25.540 --> 12:28.767
Not here, not now, not ever!

12:32.985 --> 12:34.900
When is what weighs you down

12:34.961 --> 12:38.648
also what lifts you up?

12:39.773 --> 12:42.757
"When is what weighs you down
also what lifts you up?"

12:42.890 --> 12:45.953
What a difficult riddle. If only there
was someone

12:46.015 --> 12:47.578
<i>I could discuss it with.</i>

12:47.744 --> 12:51.140
Drax, can you hear me?
Say the riddle again.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.390
<i>Drax!</i>

12:54.317 --> 12:55.578
More cheating!

12:55.718 --> 12:58.905
Have you not a shred of honor?

13:02.687 --> 13:05.608
I am not cheating
because I am not competing.

13:09.453 --> 13:12.601
We are being punished
for your weakness.

13:13.007 --> 13:15.437
You call yourself the Destroyer,

13:15.546 --> 13:19.906
but what have you ever destroyed
besides your own family?

13:20.046 --> 13:23.734
You blame Thanos, you blame Ronan,

13:23.820 --> 13:26.250
but the fault is yours!

13:26.461 --> 13:28.015
You are right.

13:28.413 --> 13:30.367
I was not strong enough
to protect them.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.953
It is a shame
I live with always.

13:33.232 --> 13:35.226
I call myself Destroyer,

13:35.601 --> 13:39.515
hoping one day I will believe it.

13:45.749 --> 13:48.296
Do not just stand there!
Lift!

13:49.354 --> 13:51.454
Yeah! Ha!

13:51.609 --> 13:53.456
I understand the riddle now.

13:53.578 --> 13:57.523
The friends and family which
weigh us down also lift us up.

13:57.617 --> 13:59.495
The temple wants us to work together.

14:00.304 --> 14:02.131
Preposterous!

14:07.438 --> 14:11.374
As I said, friends and allies
are always beneficial.

14:11.539 --> 14:15.296
False! Your friends have
merely triggered another trap!

14:22.080 --> 14:24.080
Is that... the beacon?

14:24.151 --> 14:27.328
Ha! In your face,
tattooed lady!

14:28.393 --> 14:32.039
No! In that monster's chest!

14:33.125 --> 14:36.343
Nobody panic.
I can handle this.

14:36.711 --> 14:40.369
We just need to soothe the savage
beast with a little music.

14:42.312 --> 14:43.921
<i>♪ ...dream, and you're real ♪</i>

14:43.969 --> 14:47.871
<i>♪ 'Cause my heart's
beatin' through my chest ♪</i>

14:48.218 --> 14:50.132
<i>♪ And... ♪</i>

14:53.578 --> 14:56.219
Okay, everybody can panic now.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.457
No...

15:09.506 --> 15:12.998
Xeron, attacking the Sphinx
will only endanger my friends.

15:13.169 --> 15:15.161
We must attempt to solve the riddle.

15:19.138 --> 15:21.959
All that matters
is retrieving the beacon.

15:22.086 --> 15:26.788
And I will use it to summon
the Warlock and destroy him.

15:37.509 --> 15:39.397
I must help my friends.

15:39.489 --> 15:41.538
But riddles and metaphors...

15:42.273 --> 15:45.296
The brain of Drax
does not work this way!

15:47.259 --> 15:51.944
Yes! I will consult Quill's
Oracle of Metaphor!

15:56.280 --> 15:58.288
I cannot parse these words
or their meanings.

15:58.436 --> 16:00.921
Unless...
What was it Quill said?

16:01.157 --> 16:04.655
"The lyrics do not matter,
so long as it swings."

16:07.944 --> 16:09.831
Prepare to swing, foul beast!

16:16.442 --> 16:19.180
You, too, Xeron!
Swing with Drax!

16:26.566 --> 16:27.866
As I thought.

16:27.914 --> 16:30.143
The temple does want us
to work together.

16:42.059 --> 16:44.869
Oh, I feel like I'm
gonna hurl from getting hurled!

16:46.843 --> 16:48.323
At last!

16:48.400 --> 16:51.791
The Warlock shall be summoned
and destroyed.

16:51.975 --> 16:53.975
We can't let you do that, Xeron.

16:54.034 --> 16:56.878
Do you know the destruction
the Warlock has wrought

16:56.913 --> 16:58.780
on my people throughout the ages?

16:58.815 --> 17:01.783
This is my sacred duty.
Tell them, Drax!

17:01.945 --> 17:03.638
I have met Adam Warlock.

17:03.813 --> 17:06.580
He is an honorable, if naive soul.

17:06.848 --> 17:11.426
You are on a first-name basis
with our hated enemy?

17:11.587 --> 17:13.950
Does your betrayal know no bounds?

17:30.185 --> 17:34.521
Guardians,
what... what's happened?

17:34.708 --> 17:37.505
It's all right, Adam. We're here to help.
Just stay cool.

17:37.654 --> 17:41.610
I don't want to be here!

17:41.778 --> 17:44.927
Quill, we have a problem.
His gem's getting dark.

17:44.994 --> 17:46.928
That's never a good sign.

17:53.497 --> 17:57.208
Just look at him! His rage!
He is an animal!

17:59.849 --> 18:03.724
What do you expect?
You have him in a cage!

18:04.825 --> 18:06.914
He doesn't know
how to control his powers.

18:07.036 --> 18:08.750
He just needs to calm down.

18:08.966 --> 18:12.053
Let me go!

18:22.193 --> 18:23.648
Drax!

18:24.529 --> 18:27.075
You must fulfill your destiny.

18:27.185 --> 18:29.497
Atone for your past mistakes.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.044
What did your family bring
you in the end except loss?

18:33.286 --> 18:37.700
Remember,
the Destroyer walks alone!

18:47.554 --> 18:50.154
Yes, my family brought me pain,

18:50.331 --> 18:52.777
but it is a pain I carry gladly.

18:52.962 --> 18:55.863
And their memory
makes me strong, not weak,

18:55.933 --> 18:57.823
as do my friends.

19:00.281 --> 19:02.114
Huh?

19:02.162 --> 19:03.719
Huh?

19:08.812 --> 19:10.414
Thank you, friend Drax.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.784
I'm feeling much better now.

19:13.390 --> 19:16.250
Why would the Warlock save my life

19:16.449 --> 19:19.281
after I tried to end his?

19:19.609 --> 19:21.921
A riddle to ponder, perhaps.

19:22.007 --> 19:26.062
Okay, how's about we save the hugs for
when we get outta here? Great. Run!

19:28.731 --> 19:30.750
The entrance is still gone.

19:30.821 --> 19:35.031
The Sphinx called it a test. He said,
"The best answer destroys the question."

19:35.149 --> 19:38.726
The question:
who is the true Destroyer?

19:40.001 --> 19:41.601
- We are! - We are! 
- We are! - We are!

19:53.235 --> 19:55.485
I owe you all an apology.

19:55.723 --> 19:57.821
Whatever your Warlock once was,

19:57.869 --> 20:00.962
he clearly does not deserve
to be destroyed.

20:01.266 --> 20:05.900
BUT KNOW THIS: if the Warlock does
become a threat to the galaxy,

20:06.032 --> 20:08.993
I will not hesitate
to fulfill my destiny.

20:09.188 --> 20:11.873
I would expect no less,
Xeron the Destroyer,

20:11.923 --> 20:13.813
as I must fulfill my own destiny

20:13.943 --> 20:18.235
to help the Guardians to rid
the galaxy of a great evil.

20:18.657 --> 20:20.848
So you heard about my dad then.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.188
Farewell, friend Drax.

20:24.345 --> 20:27.626
I confess, our experience has
left me with many questions

20:27.674 --> 20:30.149
about the true purpose
of the Destroyer.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.681
Perhaps it is a metaphor.

20:33.016 --> 20:36.602
Friends help us destroy
weakness, destroy ignorance,

20:36.799 --> 20:40.001
so that we might be free
to become our best selves.

20:42.455 --> 20:44.812
After my experience,
I thought I would try

20:44.860 --> 20:48.079
to better understand "metaphor"
by writing a song of my own.

20:48.274 --> 20:50.751
♪ When we met, I fell for you ♪

20:50.829 --> 20:53.696
♪ Which is a lie
because my balance is true ♪

20:53.829 --> 20:56.188
♪ My love for you
could fill the sea ♪

20:56.376 --> 20:59.126
♪ But obviously not literally ♪

20:59.321 --> 21:01.806
♪ Because love
is an abstract notion ♪

21:01.891 --> 21:05.485
♪ And has no substance
with which to fill an ocean ♪

21:07.681 --> 21:10.086
I am Groot!

21:10.431 --> 21:12.946
Well, I don't think it literally

21:13.024 --> 21:16.009
emits a foul stench,
but it kind of stinks.

21:16.094 --> 21:18.806
Do not judge until you have
heard the other 59 verses.

21:18.983 --> 21:22.851
Must I remind you? The lyrics do
not matter, so long as it swings.

21:25.024 --> 21:27.243
I'll show ya swingin'!
