WEBVTT

00:53.178 --> 00:54.554
Na-bi would love this.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.139
Yang Do-hyeok!

00:57.265 --> 00:58.433
You're here.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.020
What happened?

01:02.729 --> 01:03.897
I just got hurt a little.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.274
How? Is it bad?

01:06.357 --> 01:09.110
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.862
Gosh, it must hurt.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.655
You should have been careful.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.408
Where's Na-bi?

01:15.492 --> 01:18.328
She said she's too tired to come.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.996
She's not coming?

01:20.080 --> 01:20.997
Are you that upset?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.168
She went to her aunt's?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.378
Probably. Why?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.256
It's nothing.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.843
But where is Jae-eon?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.059
Do-yeon, take care of the guests.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.394
What? Where are you going?

01:48.650 --> 01:53.321
EPISODE 8: I KNOW IT'S A LIE.
NEVERTHELESS,

02:17.262 --> 02:19.055
YANG DO-HYEOK

02:29.607 --> 02:30.817
Is this really okay?

02:34.529 --> 02:35.530
If we continue,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.784
I don't think I can stop.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.111
Oh, there you are.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.655
Do-yeon told me you went home.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.408
Right. I was about to leave.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.494
-I'll take you home.
-No, it's fine. I can go by myself.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.914
It's late. I'll take you.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.459
All right, then.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.021
Well…

03:50.939 --> 03:51.940
What?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.401
It feels like the timing is wrong.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.862
What do you mean?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.848
What is all this?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.868
It's a flower called lisianthus.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.537
It means…

04:52.583 --> 04:53.751
Will you accept this?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.133
Do-hyeok.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.846
You're a really good person.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.603
-Then--
-But I don't think this is good timing.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.275
I don't think
I can have a good relationship right now.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.199
Is it because of Park Jae-eon?

05:28.786 --> 05:31.080
Honestly, I can't say it isn't.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.834
I ran away and came here
because of him too.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.170
Then do you want to see him again?

05:42.508 --> 05:43.468
It's not like that.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.598
Are you disappointed in me?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.475
Yes.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.314
I already knew I'd get disappointed,

05:56.814 --> 05:58.107
so a little thing like this

05:59.692 --> 06:02.445
won't make me get disappointed in you.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.115
You're just
romanticizing me right now. I--

06:06.199 --> 06:08.034
Then just…

06:09.160 --> 06:10.703
disappoint me even more.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.458
Right now, I like you so much

06:16.501 --> 06:18.377
that I don't know what to do.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.135
I like you. Sincerely.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.395
I understand how you feel.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.733
So don't be too hard on yourself.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.200
I'm sorry.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.829
I don't even know why I'm crying.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.628
Can I give you a hug?

07:01.212 --> 07:02.380
No.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.384
You'll feel better
after you cry all you want.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.095
No. I'd feel even more sorry.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.713
<i>I know…</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:47.675
<i>exactly what my tears mean.</i>

07:58.144 --> 08:00.021
<i>I cried because I felt so pathetic.</i>

08:13.826 --> 08:15.453
Did you take her home safely?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.925
You must like her a lot.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.053
Yes. Unlike someone.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.598
So stop confusing her.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.689
It's none of your business, you know.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.363
Is Na-bi easily swayed by me?

08:57.411 --> 08:59.205
No. Not at all.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.626
She says she regrets
the time she spent with you.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.128
She says she wants to forget it all.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.258
Auntie.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.852
What?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.867
It'll take some time,
so let's wait outside.

10:59.950 --> 11:00.993
Okay.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.877
I'll finish up the rest,
so wash your hands over there.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.878
All right.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.031
You're the one who made
Na-bi come here, aren't you?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.082
-Auntie.
-You're up.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.751
Did you sleep well?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.211
What are you doing here?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.506
I was learning pottery from your aunt.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.553
He came this morning,
saying he was a close friend of yours.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.805
He wanted to learn pottery,

12:02.888 --> 12:05.683
so I was teaching him
a few of my special know-hows.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.102
You don't even know him.
You should've been careful.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.812
You should've confirmed it with me.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.982
Isn't he your friend?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.195
-He is, but--
-Then it's fine.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.531
Let's eat. Do you want to join us?

12:24.326 --> 12:25.369
Sure.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.037
What are you doing?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.539
You two can catch up.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.332
Where are you going?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.188
What are you doing here?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.649
I wanted to see your aunt.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.776
Stop joking around.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.488
We didn't get to finish.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.698
What do you mean?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.829
Just forget about yesterday.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.750
By that,

13:14.543 --> 13:17.671
are you saying it didn't mean anything?

13:20.007 --> 13:21.467
It was a mistake.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.596
We were both drunk.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.685
Well, if that's how you feel.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.104
<i>He's such a coward.</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:39.026
Are you and Do-hyeok dating?

13:39.109 --> 13:40.528
You don't have to know.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.655
It's none of your business.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.745
Hey, you're so cold.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.790
You really hurt me just now.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.253
Na-bi.

13:57.962 --> 13:58.796
Sorry.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.883
-Is there anything you like?
-I'm sorry, but I should get going.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.927
You're not going to eat?

14:05.010 --> 14:07.012
Why? It won't take long.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.556
I have other plans.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.017
I loved your <i>jangjorim</i>. It's too bad.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.521
You tried my <i>jangjorim</i>? How?

14:15.604 --> 14:17.481
I sent them only to Na-bi.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.904
Can I come and learn pottery
during vacations?

14:24.405 --> 14:25.406
Of course.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.786
He's pretty talented.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.831
If I teach him well,
he might be a better assistant than you.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.082
Don't be ridiculous.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.585
I'll be off, then.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.336
All right.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.549
See you in Seoul.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.467
Take care.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.811
Let's go eat.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.580
<i>Surprisingly, my regretful past
still hasn't ended yet.</i>

15:15.539 --> 15:17.791
Here you go. Enjoy your food.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.210
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.296
Isn't Jae-eon eating?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.423
I guess he's still sleeping.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.050
He left saying he had plans.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.135
-He left?
-What plans?

15:30.638 --> 15:33.682
I'm not sure what plans he had.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.936
-What about Na-bi?
-She went to her aunt's.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.604
I see.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.569
Hey. What about Gyu-hyun? He's not eating?

15:47.154 --> 15:50.449
I don't know.
I guess he's not feeling well.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.370
Gosh. I feel awful.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.748
Do you even remember last night, Ji-wan?

15:57.831 --> 16:01.710
I remember doing the drinking games,

16:01.794 --> 16:03.796
but I don't remember anything after that.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.341
Why did you drink so much by yourself?

16:07.424 --> 16:09.843
Sol took you to your room last night

16:09.927 --> 16:11.762
and washed your face and everything.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.474
How will you live without Sol?

16:15.557 --> 16:18.227
You should
get a grip on yourself. All right?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.230
Hey, look who's talking.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.940
-Without Gyu-hyun--
-Shut up.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.108
Okay.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.034
Darn it.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.355
CENTRAL BUS TERMINAL

17:18.454 --> 17:19.413
Na-bi.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.415
Do-hyeok.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.377
I'm glad you didn't leave yet.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.255
I didn't know you were coming.
When did you get here?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.132
I wanted to see you off this time.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.801
Oh.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.515
Get home safe.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.144
I will. Good luck with the restaurant.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.607
I'm going to try uploading
various contents like you suggested.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.484
And try changing my video styles.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.651
Good thinking.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.906
Can you watch them after I edit them?

17:53.989 --> 17:56.950
Of course.
I'll watch them and give you feedback.

18:01.663 --> 18:04.458
It's nothing special,
but have this on the way.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.130
Thanks.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.384
I only receive things from you.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.552
It's fine.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.724
I'll get going now. Take care.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.435
-Sure, you too.
-Okay.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.448
They look good.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.884
Na-bi. I thought about it…

18:58.428 --> 19:00.806
and I don't think I can give up
on you that easily.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.226
Not until you see someone else

19:05.060 --> 19:07.271
or tell me you'd never like me.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.693
I'll call you later.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.820
See you next time.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.482
It's so pretty.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.054
Go. I'll return the car.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.224
-Thanks. Get back safe.
-Bye.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.308
-Take care.
-Where are you going?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.226
We're going home.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.936
-Home?
-Bye!

21:11.019 --> 21:12.562
-I'm heading to the studio.
-Bye.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.445
Aren't you getting off?

21:25.450 --> 21:28.745
The weather
seems to have gotten hotter, right?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.414
Should we get some shaved ice?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.916
I'm just going to head home.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.377
I can't just eat it by myself.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.800
Do you still not remember
anything from yesterday?

21:41.883 --> 21:44.261
What? Yesterday?

21:44.344 --> 21:47.514
Yes. I brought you
inside the room last night.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.891
And after that…

21:49.975 --> 21:52.728
Gosh. I can't remember anything.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.814
I should really quit drinking.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.942
Did I do something bad to you yesterday?

21:59.026 --> 22:00.110
Yes.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.612
Oh, really?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.574
I'm really sorry.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.869
Sol, if I ever try to drink again,

22:08.952 --> 22:12.414
just beat me up so I'll get a grip.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.502
I was just kidding. Nothing happened.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.131
Hey! You startled me.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.054
I'm tired. I'm going home now.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.431
Okay. Get home safe.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.190
Get off.

22:38.982 --> 22:39.983
Hey.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.071
Did we break up?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.322
If you agree.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.909
You agree, right?

22:54.331 --> 22:55.373
I mean…

22:57.167 --> 22:59.795
To be honest, we both knew
what each other was like--

22:59.878 --> 23:01.338
I know.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.342
But I think we were
on better terms as friends.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.763
You said it was tough
dating a guy like me, remember?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.474
Gosh.

23:13.350 --> 23:17.020
Are you still bothered by what I said?

23:17.104 --> 23:19.439
-You--
-Honestly, it's tough for me too.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.735
And we've been fighting
ever since we started dating.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.613
Were you even happy dating me?

23:26.696 --> 23:30.367
We haven't even been dating that long.
That's a bit too deep.

23:31.701 --> 23:35.163
And it seems like we both don't want
to change for each other's sake.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.500
It's best to end things here.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.378
All right.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.464
Then let's be friends again.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.423
What?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.467
You said we were better as friends.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.012
We were friends
for much longer than we dated.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.597
Why wouldn't we be friends again?

23:53.223 --> 23:55.934
Right. We could be friends again,

23:57.727 --> 23:58.937
but it feels like

23:59.521 --> 24:02.691
you might ask
to become friends with benefits later.

24:03.817 --> 24:07.487
I won't, so let's just be friends again.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.784
Nobody knows about us,
so I'll do my best not to show it.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.370
I won't cause you trouble.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.960
<i>I ended up…</i>

25:05.212 --> 25:06.671
<i>coming back.</i>

25:25.190 --> 25:27.067
Are you here to work on your assignments?

25:28.652 --> 25:31.404
I'm just going to have a smoke and leave.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.156
I have to return the car.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.909
That's tiresome.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.702
It must've been tiring for you too.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.164
-What do you mean?
-I shouldn't have told you

25:41.248 --> 25:42.624
that Na-bi was coming.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.837
Well, something good came from that.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.214
What?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.217
I can focus on my work better.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.388
I'm ending things with her.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.306
Why?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.141
I'm exhausted.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.769
It's the same for her too.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.397
I guess people never change.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.108
Right.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.492
It's been a while.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.830
Oh, Dimples.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.792
Hey, why were you ignoring me?

26:25.875 --> 26:28.878
When? Oh, right.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.298
I was with my boyfriend.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.300
Boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?

26:33.883 --> 26:37.220
I did, but not anymore. I got dumped.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.098
You? Why? Why did you get dumped?

26:41.808 --> 26:43.101
I don't know.

26:43.685 --> 26:47.022
Hey. What do you think relationships are?

26:48.690 --> 26:49.858
Relationships?

26:49.941 --> 26:52.902
Spending time with someone you love.
Eating, drinking,

26:52.986 --> 26:56.156
watching movies, talking on the phone.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.824
What's wrong with everyone?

26:57.907 --> 27:00.035
Why? What do you think they are, then?

27:01.202 --> 27:04.789
Kissing and having sex with one person.

27:06.624 --> 27:10.045
You didn't
say that to your boyfriend, did you?

27:10.128 --> 27:11.171
I didn't…

27:12.130 --> 27:15.383
No, I guess I kind of did.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.137
Right. I see why you got dumped.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.353
Hey, cute lady.

27:27.687 --> 27:28.980
I'll be there soon.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.066
All right.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.043
I kept thinking about you.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.546
I missed you.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.555
<i>But as always,</i>

28:03.431 --> 28:04.641
<i>you're not contacting me.</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:17.028
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

28:17.862 --> 28:21.783
<i>But at least it doesn't hurt me
as hard as before.</i>

28:25.578 --> 28:27.997
<i>Did I get used to feeling this way?</i>

28:28.540 --> 28:31.709
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

28:36.589 --> 28:38.258
YANG DO-HYEOK

28:43.304 --> 28:46.015
-Hey, Do-hyeok.
-<i>Hi, Na-bi. Did you arrive home?</i>

28:46.099 --> 28:49.102
Yes. I was just about to tell you.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.479
The brownies were good.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.315
<i>That's a relief.
It was my first time making them.</i>

28:54.983 --> 28:56.359
You're good at everything.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.363
The cake you made me
on my birthday was great too.

29:00.447 --> 29:04.200
I did my best to learn how to make that
since you love chocolate.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.370
I was thinking of becoming
a pastry chef because of you.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.789
What? Really? You're lying, right?

29:09.873 --> 29:10.832
Yes.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.792
Was it obvious?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.587
Hey, that wasn't even funny.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.177
It's nice to hear your voice.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.013
The whole neighborhood

29:26.222 --> 29:28.057
seems empty without you.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.977
Everyone living there will laugh at that.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.731
<i>I'm sure they'll understand
if they know how I feel right now.</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:39.694
You're going overboard.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.572
What were you doing?

29:43.865 --> 29:46.659
I was preparing for the exhibition.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.287
I rested for the past few days.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.539
I have a lot to do now.

29:52.123 --> 29:55.376
I think I'll be going to Seoul soon.
Do you want to meet up?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.298
Sure.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.218
-<i>Is there anything you want to eat?</i>
-What about you?

30:03.885 --> 30:06.888
You're coming all the way here.
I'll treat you.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.610
What?

30:21.110 --> 30:23.154
That's way better.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.656
Isn't it too noisy?

30:25.657 --> 30:28.868
What are you talking about?
I was about to raise the volume.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.538
-What? You can't hear that?
-You can hear that?

30:31.621 --> 30:35.041
Your hearing is really bad.
You listen to music loudly, don't you?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.668
You should fix that habit.

30:36.751 --> 30:37.961
You'll lose your hearing.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.964
The volume you lowered it to
is way too quiet.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.633
Okay. Then just raise it by three.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.844
-No.
-Just three more.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.720
-My ears hurt.
-Just ten, okay?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.305
-Just ten.
-We can hear it fine.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.849
-Just ten.
-What's with you?

30:50.932 --> 30:52.183
-Come on.
-Just…

31:03.528 --> 31:04.571
Are you okay?

31:05.530 --> 31:06.781
Are you hurt?

31:09.659 --> 31:11.536
No. I'm fine.

31:12.829 --> 31:13.997
I'm okay.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.203
Thanks for this.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.413
-Sure.
-Thank you.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.666
This place has the best <i>tteokbokki</i>.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.585
-Really?
-This place?

32:02.337 --> 32:03.546
Hey, Na-bi!

32:04.589 --> 32:05.590
Applying to work late?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.175
Yes.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.718
Come have some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.262
-Chopsticks.
-Come and eat.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.057
Chopsticks.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.309
Thank you.

32:16.392 --> 32:19.020
How is your piece going?
I'm looking forward to it.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.690
Jae-eon volunteered to be her assistant,
so it's going to be great.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.401
But I saw Jae-eon earlier,

32:25.985 --> 32:29.155
and he was talking to some foreigners.
What's that about?

32:29.238 --> 32:31.115
They're from VCU.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.242
They saw his works
and wanted to talk to him.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.913
Awesome. Why?
Are they trying to scout him?

32:36.996 --> 32:38.998
Yes. They wouldn't want
to lose their chance.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.000
They're probably trying to scout

32:41.084 --> 32:43.544
some kids while they're here
for the symposium.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.799
Gosh. He seems a bit overqualified
to be Na-bi's assistant.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.094
Hey, that's ridiculous. There's
no such thing as qualifications in art.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.429
Of course there is.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.389
Right.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.060
Then I guess Jae-eon would become
an artist for sure. Like Su-yeong.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.395
I guess so.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.730
You don't have to only become an artist.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.108
There are lots of jobs
related to our major.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.820
That's only for talented people.

33:09.946 --> 33:13.449
My parents did so much to send me here,
thinking they'd have

33:13.533 --> 33:15.368
an artist in the family.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.036
They spent so much money on me.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.789
I feel so bad.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.835
It's fine, Ji-wan.
I'm sure they didn't expect much.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.336
What?

33:26.754 --> 33:28.965
You're getting
the exchange program results soon.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.550
Are you preparing your portfolio?

33:31.467 --> 33:34.178
Well, yes.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.557
I'm preparing that
along with the exhibition for now.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.184
"For now"? What do you want to do, then?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.061
Well…

33:42.979 --> 33:45.732
I'm not sure…

33:47.066 --> 33:50.737
I'm not sure yet, so if I get accepted--

33:50.820 --> 33:53.489
What you want is more important, you know.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.199
Why do you want to go to Paris?

33:58.411 --> 34:00.288
Are you doing an interview or what?

34:02.749 --> 34:06.252
Working hard is nice, of course,
but you should focus on one thing.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.254
-It's a critical time right now.
-Right.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.133
I'm worried I might end up
not gaining anything at this rate.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.260
Don't worry. Everyone feels the same.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.179
Even us graduate students.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.390
There must be something you like more.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.894
Keep asking yourself what you like.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.272
I will.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.621
<i>What I like more…</i>

34:41.704 --> 34:43.581
<i>I thought I already found it, but…</i>

34:47.627 --> 34:49.670
I'll do it. Where should I move it?

34:50.463 --> 34:51.923
It's fine. I'll do it.

34:52.006 --> 34:55.718
I should do it.
I'm your assistant, remember?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.428
I can do this much.

34:59.013 --> 35:02.975
By the way, I was at the office earlier
and Gyeong-jun told me.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.144
I heard you got scouted.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.980
Are you going to America?

35:08.064 --> 35:09.398
I'm going to give it some thought.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.319
Right. I see.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.450
Oh, and I can throw away
your stuff that's at my house, right?

35:20.409 --> 35:21.494
You still have them?

35:24.038 --> 35:25.248
I'll throw them away.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.250
No, don't. I'll go get them soon.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.627
Fine, then.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.841
Do you have a lot of work left?

35:37.802 --> 35:41.180
Well, I did finish…

35:43.850 --> 35:44.934
But why?

35:45.017 --> 35:47.228
We have somewhere to go, remember?

36:14.088 --> 36:17.258
INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR

36:58.966 --> 36:59.800
Let's go.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.033
You said you wanted to see this.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.293
What do you think? Don't you like it?

37:35.044 --> 37:36.504
Well…

37:39.548 --> 37:41.092
Would it be okay to go closer?

37:41.175 --> 37:42.426
Sure.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.024
When did you buy a car?

37:57.608 --> 38:00.528
My mom gave it to me for my birthday.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.197
That's a generous gift.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.117
We lived separately since I was ten.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.410
I guess she feels sorry.

38:11.664 --> 38:12.832
This exhibition was nice.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.251
I should come again.

38:16.210 --> 38:19.880
Right. It did feel different
seeing the pieces in person.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.507
Honestly, I didn't want to come.

38:21.590 --> 38:22.591
Why?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.803
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.224
I just have bad memories about this place.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.351
Really?

38:34.478 --> 38:36.981
I saw someone so beautiful here

38:37.940 --> 38:39.734
that I fell in love at first sight.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.653
I'm sure.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.448
It was snowing that day.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.615
I didn't ask.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.701
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.453
What was the artist's name?

38:51.912 --> 38:53.706
It was boring, so I was about to leave.

38:53.789 --> 38:57.209
But then I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.046
Just like you back there.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.428
And one day,

39:08.095 --> 39:09.722
I ran into her again.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.269
I was startled.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.398
If I believed in fate,
I would have felt that this was it.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.612
But you don't.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.030
I don't.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.955
<i>Right, there's no such thing as fate.</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:39.043
<i>Everything is just
a meaningless coincidence.</i>

39:41.128 --> 39:43.089
Yun Sol!

39:49.887 --> 39:52.598
All right…

39:52.681 --> 39:54.183
Hey, Yun Sol!

39:54.934 --> 39:57.937
Your phone's broken, right? I know.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.314
It's not.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.943
Oh, then did your fingers break?
Did they just get healed?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.281
Hey. What's going on with you?

40:11.117 --> 40:11.951
What?

40:12.034 --> 40:14.954
You keep ignoring my messages.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.040
Are you angry at me about something?

40:20.626 --> 40:21.794
Why would I be?

40:22.503 --> 40:23.379
What?

40:25.881 --> 40:29.677
It's nothing. I'm just not feeling well.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.595
You're not well? Let me see.

40:36.183 --> 40:37.852
Well…

40:38.644 --> 40:41.897
I have to finish my project. I'll be off.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.372
Let's go!

40:59.623 --> 41:00.708
Keep going forward!

41:01.417 --> 41:02.960
I can only go forward!

41:10.634 --> 41:12.303
FRIENDS LIST
GYUHYUN777

41:19.143 --> 41:20.519
SEONGJU-DONG, 24, HANDSOME

41:34.867 --> 41:38.579
I'm totally screwed! What do I do?

41:39.121 --> 41:40.456
What is it?

41:42.041 --> 41:43.876
PART-TIME MODEL:
I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY

41:46.921 --> 41:48.380
I feel like crying.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.382
-Your pizza's here.
-Thank you.

41:50.466 --> 41:54.094
Darn it. It's for today's class.
The professor's going to flip.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.888
Even if we don't pay much,

41:55.971 --> 41:58.140
how can they cancel on the day of the job?

41:58.682 --> 42:01.393
We should ask
for a bigger budget or something.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.104
We can't make up
for missing models too, you know.

42:05.064 --> 42:08.025
Let's contact everyone
who might be able to make time.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.193
What class is it?

42:09.276 --> 42:10.945
Well…

42:16.700 --> 42:19.578
Jae-eon, how would you like
to do a part-time job?

42:23.666 --> 42:24.875
Well, I…

42:24.959 --> 42:27.211
Jae-eon, try this too.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.922
This looks so filling.
You'll be full with just that.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.507
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

42:31.590 --> 42:32.508
Go on.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.471
-Isn't it good?
-It's good.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.765
-You should eat too. It's good.
-Sure.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.351
Isn't it good?

42:42.434 --> 42:44.687
It's great. Jae-eon, try the sauce too.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.355
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

42:50.150 --> 42:51.569
What? It's Mr. An again.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.946
-What?
-Jeez.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.823
When are we getting a real model?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.783
Even if we can't get nude models,

42:57.866 --> 42:59.743
we can't keep having you as our model…

42:59.827 --> 43:01.453
We're getting sick of it now.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.622
You guys, quiet down.

43:04.873 --> 43:09.837
All right. We have
a special model for today's class.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.171
-Is it you?
-Me?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.007
It's probably Ms. Jo again.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.550
All right, come in!

43:21.140 --> 43:22.558
No way.

43:22.641 --> 43:25.102
I can draw a hundred sketches of him.

43:26.061 --> 43:27.563
He could be our main model.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.030
Next pose, please.

44:37.716 --> 44:41.720
Why did Jae-eon agree to do this, though?

44:42.304 --> 44:43.681
It's so unlike him.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.265
Because Mr. An told him--

44:52.731 --> 44:54.525
Good work today, everyone.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.360
-Thanks. You did good.
-Thank you.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.278
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.655
The model was great today.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.156
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.991
She just said the model was great.

45:03.075 --> 45:04.827
-Are you going to the studio?
-Should we eat?

45:04.910 --> 45:06.495
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

45:06.995 --> 45:09.790
-Do you want to go eat?
-Do you want to go eat, Sol?

45:09.873 --> 45:11.041
Go ahead first.

45:11.125 --> 45:14.169
Hey, Jae-eon. How do you
do that flirtatious wink?

45:14.753 --> 45:16.839
What? Me? I didn't wink.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.590
-Why would you do that?
-I didn't!

45:18.674 --> 45:19.842
How shameless.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.975
Jae-eon, can you help out?

45:28.058 --> 45:30.352
-Jae-eon? Help us.
-Okay.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.146
He was the model, though.

45:35.357 --> 45:36.400
Do-hyeok.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.738
-It must've been tough coming here.
-It's fine.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.032
-What's that?
-What? Oh, it's nothing.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.618
You're hungry, right? Let's go.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.120
-It's this way.
-Okay.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.668
Gosh. Did you make this yourself?

45:54.751 --> 45:55.836
Yes.

45:56.503 --> 45:57.671
Gosh…

46:01.049 --> 46:02.468
This looks so good.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.306
It's delicious.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.393
I only had delivery
and convenience store food these days.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.023
-I'll make food for you often.
-Sure.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.610
You must've stayed up late making this.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.737
It would've been tough coming here too.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.113
No, it didn't take long.

46:23.697 --> 46:25.407
I brought some fruits too.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.034
Okay. What's this?

46:27.618 --> 46:28.452
Open it.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.247
-What is it?
-Don't get anxious.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.374
I didn't make a heart
with beans or anything.

46:35.751 --> 46:36.960
You noticed that?

46:40.547 --> 46:42.299
Hey, I love these!

46:44.009 --> 46:46.136
-Dip it in the sauce.
-You should eat too.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.137
I'm okay.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.061
-Thanks for this.
-Enjoy.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.981
Jae-eon!

47:08.575 --> 47:09.743
What is it?

47:09.826 --> 47:10.911
It's nothing.

47:11.828 --> 47:14.790
When you said you'd show me your videos,

47:14.873 --> 47:18.752
I thought you'd send them to me
through email or message.

47:18.835 --> 47:19.878
I see.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.381
I wanted to see you too.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.424
Right. I'm glad you came.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.760
I got to eat a nice meal too.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.557
Let's watch.
I'm curious about your videos.

47:32.891 --> 47:33.892
All right.

47:39.606 --> 47:40.649
Here.

47:42.568 --> 47:43.527
Left ear.

47:48.907 --> 47:49.992
Play.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.786
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
DIRECTIONS TO THE NOODLE SHOP

47:53.829 --> 47:55.247
The music is good.

48:02.754 --> 48:06.216
Hey! Isn't this the beach
in front of the noodle shop?

48:06.300 --> 48:07.884
Yes, it is.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.512
Gosh. I want to go there too.

48:15.100 --> 48:17.603
-It's kind of weird, right?
-No, it's fine.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.899
How do you chop so well?

48:29.031 --> 48:30.198
Nice.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.006
This is amazing.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.300
Stop looking at it.

48:48.383 --> 48:50.761
If you keep looking at it,
you'll see the flaws.

48:51.887 --> 48:53.680
I knew it.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.058
You're really talented.

48:56.808 --> 48:59.645
It's nothing. Everyone can do that much.

49:00.812 --> 49:01.813
That again?

49:03.607 --> 49:04.775
Na-bi.

49:05.484 --> 49:08.737
You don't seem to know
how talented and charming you are.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.369
What's with the sudden compliment?

49:16.203 --> 49:18.413
You keep saying stuff like that
out of the blue.

49:19.081 --> 49:22.292
I'm not the one who doesn't know.
It's you who doesn't know me.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.757
Oh, by the way, did you get an assistant?

49:30.926 --> 49:33.345
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

49:33.428 --> 49:36.473
I'm working on it
with two juniors from my department.

49:38.058 --> 49:39.559
-I see.
-Yes.

49:40.602 --> 49:44.314
<i>I can't bring myself to tell him
that Jae-eon is one of them.</i>

49:47.317 --> 49:49.236
<i>Why does it feel like I'm cheating?</i>

49:50.862 --> 49:51.905
That's great.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.950
It's too bad I lost my chance

49:56.368 --> 49:57.494
to help you, though.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.205
Right.

50:01.540 --> 50:04.292
Your class must be starting soon.
Go on inside.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.796
No, it's fine.
I'll walk you to the main gate.

50:10.215 --> 50:12.134
Are you going back home today?

50:13.051 --> 50:16.304
I'm visiting the restaurant later,
so I'm not sure.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.891
Oh, right. The one you worked at?

50:19.975 --> 50:20.976
-Yes.
-Okay.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.562
Are you working late again tonight?

50:26.273 --> 50:27.357
Probably.

50:28.608 --> 50:30.152
Isn't it scary at night?

50:31.194 --> 50:32.237
Not at all.

50:32.988 --> 50:34.948
I actually focus better at night.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.620
Thanks for walking me here.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.623
I didn't really do much.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.333
And thanks for watching my videos.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.586
I'll use some of the ideas you gave me.

50:47.669 --> 50:49.421
Okay, then.

50:49.504 --> 50:51.548
-I should get back now.
-Okay.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.508
-I'm really going.
-Okay.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.303
Thanks for the meal.

50:56.803 --> 50:58.805
Thank you. Go on.

50:58.889 --> 51:00.140
Be careful on the way.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.809
<i>I don't ever want</i>

51:04.561 --> 51:06.438
<i>to disappoint Do-hyeok.</i>

51:13.487 --> 51:16.239
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SELECTED
FOR THE EXCHANGE STUDENT PROGRAM

51:45.977 --> 51:47.187
MY SOL

51:47.270 --> 51:49.356
LET'S EAT DINNER TONIGHT IF YOU'RE FREE
SURE, I'M FREE

51:52.776 --> 51:54.277
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

51:54.361 --> 51:55.987
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

52:09.084 --> 52:10.210
I…

52:19.594 --> 52:21.429
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

53:22.407 --> 53:23.575
Aren't you leaving?

53:24.117 --> 53:25.201
You're going?

53:25.285 --> 53:27.996
I have plans. What about you?
Are you staying up all night?

53:29.289 --> 53:30.290
I don't know.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.460
Should I just leave too?

53:34.085 --> 53:34.920
Is something up?

53:37.255 --> 53:39.090
No, nothing.

53:39.174 --> 53:41.676
You don't look so good.
Don't strain yourself.

53:43.136 --> 53:44.846
-All right.
-Bye, then.

53:45.889 --> 53:46.973
Bye.

54:04.032 --> 54:06.785
I really don't feel like working.

54:14.876 --> 54:17.253
You're late. Did you eat dinner?

54:17.337 --> 54:18.254
I did.

54:20.340 --> 54:22.884
I told you not to drink
straight from the bottle!

54:22.968 --> 54:24.678
Oh, okay.

54:34.479 --> 54:35.855
You look exhausted.

54:35.939 --> 54:37.691
Was it your part-time job at the academy?

54:37.774 --> 54:40.568
No, I was setting up stuff
for the exhibition.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.237
My part-time job is on weekends.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.990
Don't strain yourself.
We have to write our thesis too.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.618
By the way, who was your roommate before?

54:49.202 --> 54:51.246
-My roommate? Yun--
-Yun-ji?

54:51.329 --> 54:53.164
Yun-seok, a contemporary art major.

54:53.248 --> 54:55.250
-He went to the military.
-Is that all?

54:55.333 --> 54:56.710
Well, before that,

54:56.793 --> 54:59.129
-there was--
-Oh, never mind.

54:59.713 --> 55:02.257
I'm still looking for a room.
I'll be able to leave soon.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.800
What's the hurry?

55:03.883 --> 55:07.095
If you're overworking these days
because of that…

55:07.178 --> 55:09.431
Jeez. You're at it again.

55:10.015 --> 55:10.890
What?

55:12.183 --> 55:14.227
Why are you so nosy?

55:14.310 --> 55:16.354
You don't need to mind me.

55:23.611 --> 55:25.030
Is that a cat?

55:27.198 --> 55:28.408
Oh, I forgot.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.702
Are you allergic to cats?

55:30.785 --> 55:32.704
No, I'm not. But…

55:32.787 --> 55:33.830
That's a relief.

55:34.330 --> 55:37.167
I've been taking care
of this stray cat for a while.

55:37.250 --> 55:40.545
I was waiting for its mother,
but she never came.

55:41.129 --> 55:42.839
And it must've been in the rain.

55:42.922 --> 55:45.508
I thought it shouldn't be alone,
so I brought it home.

55:45.592 --> 55:49.262
Gosh, you're taking care of animals now?

55:49.846 --> 55:51.014
You're unbelievable.

55:51.097 --> 55:52.891
-Isn't it cute? Do you want to hold it?
-Sure.

55:54.768 --> 55:57.562
Oh, my gosh. It's so tiny.

55:58.730 --> 55:59.814
I guess it likes you.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.110
Hey, I'm the one who brought you here.

56:05.403 --> 56:06.738
Have you named it yet?

56:06.821 --> 56:08.656
Not yet. What should I name it?

56:08.740 --> 56:09.949
Let's see.

56:11.409 --> 56:13.411
Congratulations.

56:13.495 --> 56:16.039
You've met a guardian

56:16.122 --> 56:18.583
who is so nosy and full of compassion.

56:21.628 --> 56:22.754
It's trying to go in.

56:23.379 --> 56:24.798
It's so cute.

56:25.924 --> 56:26.758
What?

56:52.283 --> 56:53.368
Yun Sol.

56:54.869 --> 56:56.329
Let's talk for a minute.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.172
I have to meet someone.

57:07.132 --> 57:08.174
Let's talk later.

57:08.883 --> 57:11.386
Who are you meeting at this hour?

57:13.429 --> 57:16.182
It won't take long. I'll be quick.

57:20.645 --> 57:22.188
Well…

57:23.273 --> 57:27.652
I've been thinking about why
you're acting like this to me these days.

57:29.070 --> 57:30.905
I think you've changed

57:30.989 --> 57:35.034
since we came back from the workshop.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.995
So I guess

57:37.078 --> 57:41.040
it's because of what I did that night.

57:42.333 --> 57:43.585
What I mean to say is…

57:44.169 --> 57:47.714
I remember what happened that night.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.721
So?

57:55.388 --> 57:56.723
Is that it?

57:57.515 --> 57:58.641
What?

58:00.643 --> 58:03.146
-No, that's not it.
-What is it, then?

58:05.815 --> 58:06.733
Well…

58:09.611 --> 58:10.612
I don't know!

58:11.279 --> 58:14.449
I thought you'd say something too.

58:14.532 --> 58:17.869
Do you want to apologize
about what you did that night?

58:19.579 --> 58:20.705
What?

58:20.788 --> 58:22.832
Well, I…

58:23.541 --> 58:28.755
I guess you think
I should apologize for what I did, then.

58:30.423 --> 58:32.091
If what you did

58:33.968 --> 58:36.054
was just a mistake you need to fix.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.599
What? What do you mean?

58:41.017 --> 58:42.977
Because if you did that with no meaning,

58:44.562 --> 58:46.189
then you're hurting me.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.110
Because…

58:52.362 --> 58:53.738
I like you.

58:56.449 --> 58:59.202
Of course, I like you too.

58:59.285 --> 59:00.370
Not as friends.

59:07.460 --> 59:10.380
Yun Sol. What's going on?

59:11.881 --> 59:13.550
I'm not saying I'll do anything.

59:14.884 --> 59:18.930
And I know very well
that you don't like me.

59:24.852 --> 59:28.940
I thought I'd be able
to act like nothing happened.

59:31.859 --> 59:33.194
But it's difficult.

59:43.162 --> 59:45.748
I guess I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

59:47.709 --> 59:48.668
I'm sorry…

59:50.169 --> 59:51.462
for liking you.

59:55.925 --> 59:57.010
Well…

59:58.928 --> 1:00:01.055
I'm going to be late. I should get going.

1:00:09.522 --> 1:00:11.357
It wasn't meaningless.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:13.943
So I won't apologize.

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:20.575
But I'm not sure how I feel.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:58.321
Hey, guys. I'm here.

1:00:58.404 --> 1:01:00.073
Hey, Do-hyeok.

1:01:00.990 --> 1:01:02.283
How have you been?

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:03.868
Good. Just the two of us.

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:06.704
-What's this?
-It's nothing special.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:09.916
You look really happy.

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:12.627
He's the owner of a restaurant now.

1:01:12.710 --> 1:01:15.004
I don't think that's it.

1:01:15.088 --> 1:01:17.048
Your face is totally glowing.

1:01:18.299 --> 1:01:21.636
I'm in a pretty good mood these days.

1:01:21.719 --> 1:01:22.929
What?

1:01:24.764 --> 1:01:26.683
-I get it.
-What?

1:01:28.059 --> 1:01:30.603
You're finally dating someone, right?

1:01:30.687 --> 1:01:32.146
It's not that.

1:01:32.230 --> 1:01:34.607
-Is it true? Who is it?
-No.

1:01:35.274 --> 1:01:36.317
That girl from before?

1:01:37.485 --> 1:01:38.611
Well…

1:02:43.426 --> 1:02:46.637
PARK JAE-EON

1:03:01.819 --> 1:03:03.070
PARK JAE-EON

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:07.116
PARK JAE-EON

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:50.952
Do you want to go see butterflies?

1:04:52.179 --> 1:04:53.139
I'll be there soon.

1:04:53.222 --> 1:04:56.642
<i>Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.</i>

1:04:56.726 --> 1:05:00.980
<i>Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.</i>

1:05:01.063 --> 1:05:02.356
<i>Do you like him?</i>

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:03.733
<i>Let's not make another mistake.</i>

1:05:03.816 --> 1:05:07.236
<i>Maybe Na-bi was already drifting
away from me.</i>

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.447
<i>Can we meet right now?</i>

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:11.324
<i>If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.</i>

1:05:11.407 --> 1:05:13.451
<i>Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?</i>

1:05:13.534 --> 1:05:15.912
<i>Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.</i>

1:05:15.995 --> 1:05:17.747
<i>I can't find a solution.</i>

1:05:17.830 --> 1:05:19.081
I miss you.

1:05:19.165 --> 1:05:21.918
<i>I'm not used to how I am
when I'm with Na-bi.</i>

1:05:22.543 --> 1:05:26.005
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:28.049
<i>Do you really think this is a mistake?</i>

1:05:28.132 --> 1:05:29.717
<i>-Of course.
-That's a lie.</i>

1:05:30.593 --> 1:05:32.345
<i>Let's go out.</i>

1:05:32.887 --> 1:05:37.516
