FOR THERE TO STILL BE ELECTIONS

08:26.439 --> 08:32.278
WOULD LIKE TO AVOID SOME KIND O,

>> Bill: REALLY?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.591
WHAT IS YOUR OPTIMISM BASED ON?

08:45.658 --> 08:47.793
>> I'M NOT AN OPTIMIST OR A

08:47.860 --> 08:48.594
PESSIMIST, I'M JUST HOPEFUL AND

08:48.661 --> 08:49.128
I LOVE MY COUNTRY.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.732
WHAT I'M AFRAID OF IS IF WE STAY

08:52.798 --> 08:54.367
IN THIS COCOON OF THE BIG LIE,

08:54.433 --> 08:55.635
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

08:55.701 --> 08:56.936
COUNTRY A FEW YEARS DOWN THE

08:57.003 --> 08:58.237
LINE AND I THINK THE ARGUMENTS

08:58.304 --> 08:59.005
FOR THAT ARE PRETTY STRONG.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.140
>> Bill: OKAY.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.408
>> BUT THERE ARE SOME

09:02.475 --> 09:03.509
REPUBLICANS IN GOOD FAITH TO

09:03.576 --> 09:05.344
LOOK BACK AT THE DISASTER AND

09:05.411 --> 09:05.544
AGREE.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.781
>> Bill: THERE ARE SOME.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.348
TEN.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.383
THERE WERE TEN CONGRESSMEN WHO

09:10.449 --> 09:11.484
VOTED AGAINST HIS IMPEACHMENT

09:11.550 --> 09:13.185
FOR DOING THIS, TEN.

09:13.252 --> 09:17.823
TWO OF THEM, LIZ CHENEY AND

09:17.890 --> 09:18.324
GONZALES, NOT RUNNING.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.525
LIZ CHENEY IS NOT GOING TO WIN.

09:19.592 --> 09:23.162
THE OTHER EIGHT HAVE GONE TO

09:23.229 --> 09:24.130
SILENCE ON THIS BECAUSE YOU

09:24.196 --> 09:25.398
CAN'T GO AGAINST THE CULT

09:25.464 --> 09:25.631
LEADER.

09:25.698 --> 09:29.635
SO AGAIN, I DON'T SEE WHERE YOUR

09:29.702 --> 09:31.437
OPTIMISM IS BASED.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.105
SECRETARIES OF STATE IN 15 SWING

09:33.172 --> 09:36.709
STATES, 15 OF THEM, TWO OF THE

09:36.776 --> 09:38.678
15 ADMIT THAT TRUMP LOST THE

09:38.744 --> 09:39.011
ELECTION.

09:39.078 --> 09:39.845
THAT MEANS THAT THE SECRETARIES

09:39.912 --> 09:40.980
OF STATE, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE

09:41.047 --> 09:45.651
WHO COUNT THE VOTES IN THE NEXT

09:45.718 --> 09:46.819
ELECTION, 13 OF THOSE 15 IN

09:46.886 --> 09:48.487
SWING STATES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO

09:48.554 --> 09:50.690
ARE ALREADY IN THE TANK FOR

09:50.756 --> 09:51.590
TRUMP.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.225
>> NO, YEAH, I LIKE BEING CALLED

09:53.292 --> 09:55.761
AN OPTIMIST, I DON'T GET THAT

09:55.828 --> 09:58.064
ALL THAT OFTEN, BECAUSE THAT

09:58.130 --> 10:00.032
RIGHT NOW IS THE MAINSTREAM

10:00.099 --> 10:00.299
SCENARIO.

10:00.366 --> 10:03.002
THE MAINSTREAM SCENARIO IN 2024

10:03.069 --> 10:04.870
IS SOMETHING LIKE, HE LOSES BY

10:04.937 --> 10:08.307
10 MILLION POPULAR VOTES, LOSES

10:08.374 --> 10:10.876
BY MANY DOZEN ELECTORAL VOTES

10:10.943 --> 10:12.945
BUT SOME STATES, EITHER

10:13.012 --> 10:13.846
ALTERNATE STATE ELECTORS OR THEY

10:13.913 --> 10:15.648
JUST RUN OUT THE CLOCK AND HE

10:15.715 --> 10:16.515
GETS INSTALLED AS PRESIDENT

10:16.582 --> 10:16.749
ANYWAY.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.918
I THINK RIGHT NOW WHERE WE STAND

10:18.985 --> 10:20.653
IT IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.321
AND THE REASON WHY I APPEAL TO

10:22.388 --> 10:23.356
REPUBLICANS AS I DON'T THINK

10:23.422 --> 10:25.458
THEY THOUGHT IT ALL THE WAY

10:25.524 --> 10:26.225
THROUGH, ALL OF THEM.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.560
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT WINNING

10:27.626 --> 10:28.594
THE GAME, BUT IF YOU TREAT IT AS

10:28.661 --> 10:30.763
A GAME AT SOME POINT THE OTHER

10:30.830 --> 10:31.697
SIDE IS GOING TO WALK AWAY AND

10:31.764 --> 10:33.866
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

10:33.933 --> 10:34.200
COUNTRY LEFT.

10:34.266 --> 10:35.868
>> Bill: NO, I THINK THEY ARE

10:35.935 --> 10:36.669
THINKING ABOUT THE CORNER

10:36.736 --> 10:36.902
OFFICE.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.771
>> YEAH.

10:38.838 --> 10:39.672
>> Bill: I DID A WHOLE THING

10:39.739 --> 10:41.340
ABOUT THIS THE OTHER NIGHT, THEY

10:41.407 --> 10:42.675
HAVE A NICE OFFICE, THEY HAVE A

10:42.742 --> 10:43.709
JOB THEY COULD NEVER OTHERWISE

10:43.776 --> 10:46.078
GET BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO SKILLS.

10:46.145 --> 10:46.479
[LAUGHTER]

10:46.545 --> 10:47.980
AND YOU DON'T NEED ANY SKILLS TO

10:48.047 --> 10:48.381
BE A CONGRESSMAN.

10:48.447 --> 10:51.250
[APPLAUSE]

10:51.317 --> 10:53.519
YOU GET A STAFF, YOU GET A NICE

10:53.586 --> 10:56.322
OFFICE, PEOPLE KISS YOUR ASS,

10:56.389 --> 10:57.256
YOU GET A TABLE IN THE

10:57.323 --> 10:57.556
RESTAURANT.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.725
THAT'S WHY THEY DO IT.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.328
>> YEAH, YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT THIS

11:02.395 --> 11:03.496
IS WHY DEMOCRACY IS GOOD,

11:03.562 --> 11:03.729
THOUGH.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.799
IF WE WERE A MORE DEMOCRATIC

11:06.866 --> 11:07.867
COUNTRY, WE HAD LESS

11:07.933 --> 11:08.667
GERRYMANDERING AND VOTER

11:08.734 --> 11:09.869
SUPPRESSION, THEN CONGRESSMAN

11:09.935 --> 11:11.670
WOULD HAVE TO DO AT LEAST ONE

11:11.737 --> 11:13.105
THING WHICH IS REPRESENT THE

11:13.172 --> 11:14.040
POPULATION.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.042
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS AS WE

11:16.108 --> 11:17.676
MOVE AWAY FROM DEMOCRACY,

11:17.743 --> 11:19.779
SILENTLY, STEP-BY-STEP, THE JOB

11:19.845 --> 11:21.013
OF CONGRESSMAN BECOMES MORE AND

11:21.080 --> 11:22.281
MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

11:22.348 --> 11:22.882
ABOUT AND LESS AND LESS LIKE

11:22.948 --> 11:25.684
WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS

11:25.751 --> 11:26.519
THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE.

11:26.585 --> 11:27.553
>> Bill: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT

11:27.620 --> 11:28.921
I KEEP THINKING WHERE THE RUBBER

11:28.988 --> 11:30.289
HITS THE ROAD, WHICH IS THE

11:30.356 --> 11:33.392
PERIOD BETWEEN ELECTION DAY 2024

11:33.459 --> 11:38.631
AND INAUGURATION DAY, WHICH IS

11:38.697 --> 11:41.600
JANUARY 20TH, 2025.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.334
BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT WE ARE

11:42.401 --> 11:45.171
SEEING HERE ABOUT HOW TRUMP IS

11:45.237 --> 11:46.605
RIGHT NOW CHANGING THE PEOPLE IN

11:46.672 --> 11:47.306
POWER.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.174
I MEAN, SOMETIMES THEY'VE

11:48.240 --> 11:50.176
CHANGED IT SO THAT STATE

11:50.242 --> 11:51.677
LEGISLATURES COUNT THE VOTES

11:51.744 --> 11:52.711
INSTEAD OF THE SECRETARY OF

11:52.778 --> 11:53.212
STATE.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.847
WELL, IN 2022 THE REPUBLICANS

11:54.914 --> 11:56.015
ARE GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTIONS

11:56.082 --> 11:58.584
BIG TIME, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

11:58.651 --> 11:59.652
THOSE STATE LEGISLATURES.

11:59.718 --> 12:03.389
SO LET'S SAY IN 2024, IT WAS

12:03.456 --> 12:06.926
WISCONSIN SEND A BOGUS STATE OF

12:06.992 --> 12:07.460
ELECTORS, RIGHT?

12:07.526 --> 12:08.527
HE DIDN'T REALLY WIN THOSE

12:08.594 --> 12:09.328
STATES, BUT THEY ARE SENDING

12:09.395 --> 12:12.598
THAT BECAUSE THEY FOUND BAMBOO,

12:12.665 --> 12:13.966
OR SOME CRAZY SHIT, OR THAT THEY

12:14.033 --> 12:16.702
THINK THE DOMINION PEOPLE IN

12:16.769 --> 12:18.237
VENEZUELA SWITCH THE VOTING,

12:18.304 --> 12:18.938
WHATEVER CRAZY SHIT THEY TRIED

12:19.004 --> 12:21.540
LAST TIME, THIS TIME THOSE

12:21.607 --> 12:23.075
PEOPLE ARE GOING ALONG WITH IT.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.310
RUDY GIULIANI IS GOING TO BE OUT

12:24.376 --> 12:25.111
THERE WITH HIS HAIR DYE GOING

12:25.177 --> 12:27.446
DOWN HIS FACE --

12:27.513 --> 12:27.713
[LAUGHTER]

12:27.780 --> 12:28.747
BUT THIS TIME THEY ARE GOING TO

12:28.814 --> 12:31.317
BELIEVE THAT.

12:31.383 --> 12:31.650
OKAY.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.719
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

12:33.786 --> 12:38.357
KAMALA HARRIS HAS TWO ON JANUART

12:38.424 --> 12:41.127
MIKE PENCE DID, BUT THIS

12:41.193 --> 12:44.163
TIME SHE HAS TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT

12:44.230 --> 12:46.132
HE DIDN'T DO, SHE HAS TO THROW

12:46.198 --> 12:47.566
OUT THOSE VOTES BECAUSE THEY ARE

12:47.633 --> 12:47.766
BOGUS.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.102
>> YEAH.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.070
>> Bill: NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

12:51.137 --> 12:53.706
WHAT IS TRUMP'S PEOPLE DO THEN?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.241
>> WHAT DO TRUMP'S PEOPLE DO

12:55.307 --> 12:56.876
THEM BUT WHAT DOES EVERYBODY DO

12:56.942 --> 12:57.309
THEN?

12:57.376 --> 12:58.878
BECAUSE IN THOSE TWO WEEKS IT

12:58.944 --> 13:01.280
WILL BE CLEAR A PLOT IS UNDERWAY

13:01.347 --> 13:01.847
ESSENTIALLY --

13:01.914 --> 13:03.682
>> Bill: A PLOT TO YOU.

13:03.749 --> 13:06.619
TO THEM, A RESTORATION OF TRUTH,

13:06.685 --> 13:07.820
JUSTICE AND THE AMERICAN WAY.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.089
>> THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

13:10.156 --> 13:10.923
IN OUR SCENARIO WHERE TRUMP HAS

13:10.990 --> 13:11.924
LOST THE ELECTION THAT MEANS

13:11.991 --> 13:13.192
THERE IS A LOT OF HIGHLY

13:13.259 --> 13:13.792
MOTIVATED PEOPLE WHO ARE KEEN

13:13.859 --> 13:17.930
NOT F SELL NOT JUST FOR

13:17.997 --> 13:19.431
HIM NOT TO BE PRESIDENT BUT TO

13:19.498 --> 13:21.033
HAVE THE SCENARIO NOT PLAY OUT.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.434
IN TWO YEARS EVERYBODY IS GOING

13:22.501 --> 13:23.602
TO KNOW THAT THE SCENARIO IS

13:23.669 --> 13:25.204
POSSIBLE AND IF PEOPLE WATCH

13:25.271 --> 13:29.108
THIS HAPPEN, STALE BROKEN STEP

13:29.175 --> 13:30.843
BY STEEL BROKEN STEP, THEY WILL

13:30.910 --> 13:32.378
COME TO THE CONCLUSION WE SHOULD

13:32.444 --> 13:33.679
BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.780
THAT IS WHAT WORRIES ME IN THOSE

13:34.847 --> 13:36.649
TWO WEEKS, WE WILL HAVE

13:36.715 --> 13:37.783
PARTISANS ON BOTH SIDES WHO WILL

13:37.850 --> 13:38.717
THINK THEIR PRESIDENT IS THE

13:38.784 --> 13:40.452
PRESIDENT AND WE WILL HAVE

13:40.519 --> 13:41.353
GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS UNSURE

13:41.420 --> 13:42.588
WHO THE ACTUAL PRESIDENT IS, AND

13:42.655 --> 13:45.357
THE COUNTRY, I DON'T MEAN THIS

13:45.424 --> 13:47.960
METAPHORICALLY, I MEAN IT

13:48.027 --> 13:48.827
LITERALLY, THEN THE COUNTRY WILL

13:48.894 --> 13:49.128
BREAK DOWN.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.462
>> Bill: THAT IS MY QUESTION

13:50.529 --> 13:50.696
TO YOU.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.331
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MOVIE IN

13:52.398 --> 13:56.035
YOUR HEAD OF WHAT YOU SEE IN

13:56.101 --> 13:56.502
THAT PERIOD BEFORE

13:56.569 --> 13:57.570
INAUGURATION DAY, WHAT DO YOU

13:57.636 --> 13:58.704
SEE GOING ON IN THE STREETS,

13:58.771 --> 14:00.339
WHAT DO YOU SEE GOING ON IN

14:00.406 --> 14:01.874
WASHINGTON, AND WHAT HAPPENS ON

14:01.941 --> 14:04.710
THAT DAY, JANUARY 20TH, 2025?

14:04.777 --> 14:06.745
WHEN THEY BOTH SHOW UP.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.648
>> YEAH, I IMAGINE TRUMP GIVING

14:09.715 --> 14:12.451
A VICTORY SPEECH FROM SOME KIND

14:12.518 --> 14:13.085
OF ISOLATED, PROTECTED LOCATION,

14:13.152 --> 14:14.019
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COMES TO

14:14.086 --> 14:14.620
MY MIND.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.387
I IMAGINE PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY

14:15.454 --> 14:18.123
TRYING TO REAFFIRM WHAT THE

14:18.190 --> 14:19.458
CHAINS OF COMMAND ACTUALLY ARE.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.893
I IMAGINE AMERICANS AND BLUE

14:20.960 --> 14:21.860
STATES GOING TO RED STATES AND

14:21.927 --> 14:23.195
AMERICANS IN RED STATES GOING TO

14:23.262 --> 14:23.829
BLUE STATES WORRYING ABOUT WHAT

14:23.896 --> 14:26.865
IS GOING TO COME NEXT.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.400
AND WHAT I REALLY WORRY --

14:28.467 --> 14:30.069
>> Bill: YOU ARE SAYING

14:30.135 --> 14:30.669
AMERICANS, JUST CITIZENS GOING

14:30.736 --> 14:32.371
TO PLACES IN THE COUNTRY WHERE

14:32.438 --> 14:34.773
THEY FEEL SAFER FROM THEIR

14:34.840 --> 14:35.641
FELLOW CITIZENS.

14:35.708 --> 14:35.941
TO CITIZENS.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.009
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.679
>> Bill: I AGREE.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.448
>> THE MOST HEAVILY ARMED

14:42.514 --> 14:44.216
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, 48% OF

14:44.283 --> 14:46.051
AMERICANS THINK A CIVIL WAR IS

14:46.118 --> 14:46.719
LIKELY.

14:46.785 --> 14:47.586
A FIFTH OF AMERICANS ACCORDING

14:47.653 --> 14:48.120
TO THE POLLS ARE READY FOR

14:48.187 --> 14:50.589
MILITARY RULE.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.024
THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK

14:52.091 --> 14:52.891
WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS SOME KIND

14:52.958 --> 14:54.226
OF COLLAPSE.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.194
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ALREADY, SO

14:55.261 --> 14:56.662
IF POLITICIANS A DISH UP FOR

14:56.729 --> 14:57.930
THEM THE SCENARIO, THE VERY

14:57.997 --> 14:59.698
SCENARIO THAT COULD BREAK THE

14:59.765 --> 15:01.934
COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

15:02.001 --> 15:02.601
RIGHTFULLY AFRAID.

15:02.668 --> 15:03.902
THEY ARE ALREADY IN A MENTAL

15:03.969 --> 15:05.371
PLACE WHERE IF YOU GIVEN THAT

15:05.437 --> 15:07.306
SCENARIO, THEY ARE GOING TO

15:07.373 --> 15:07.506
REACT.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.774
>> Bill: MY LAST QUESTION IS

15:08.841 --> 15:09.875
ABOUT THE FUTURE EVEN FROM

15:09.942 --> 15:12.678
THERE, IF WE HAVE ONE.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.446
WHEN IT'S A CULT OF PERSONALITY,

15:14.513 --> 15:16.882
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRUMP, IT NEVER

15:16.949 --> 15:20.619
GOES AWAY.

15:20.686 --> 15:21.153
YOU KNOW?

15:21.220 --> 15:26.091
IN KOREA, IT'S KIM, THEN KIM,

15:26.158 --> 15:27.192
AND LET ME GUESS, THE NEXT

15:27.259 --> 15:29.928
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE KIM.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.764
AND HERE'S GOING TO BE DON JR.,

15:31.830 --> 15:34.433
OR IVANKA, OR WHOEVER THEIR KIDS

15:34.500 --> 15:35.267
ARE.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.201
ONCE YOU CREATE THIS CULT OF

15:36.268 --> 15:38.504
PERSONALITY WITH A FIGURE WHO IS

15:38.570 --> 15:39.138
ABOVE REASON, I DON'T THINK IT

15:39.204 --> 15:41.373
NEVER GOES AWAY.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.942
SO THAT'S YOUR NEXT BOOK.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.444
[LAUGHS]

15:45.511 --> 15:46.412
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PROFESSOR.

15:46.478 --> 15:46.779
I APPRECIATE IT.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.682
HOPE WE AREN'T BEING TOO

15:49.748 --> 15:50.582
PESSIMISTIC.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.718
THANKS, LET'S MEET OUR PANEL.

15:52.785 --> 15:58.857
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

15:58.924 --> 15:59.625
HEY, LOOK AT YOU TWO.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.360
THE MILLENNIALS ARE HERE WITH

16:01.427 --> 16:01.527

16:01.593 --> 16:04.296
HE IS THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN

16:04.363 --> 16:06.332
REPRESENTING NEW YORK'S 15TH

16:06.398 --> 16:08.067
DISTRICT WHO AT 25 YEARS OLD,

16:16.508 --> 16:17.609
RITCHIE TORRES IS OVER HERE.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.679
[APPLAUSE]

16:20.746 --> 16:21.847
SHE'S EDITOR OF THE NEWSLETTER

16:21.914 --> 16:22.448
"COMMON SENSE" ON SUBSTACK AND

16:22.514 --> 16:23.115
HOST OF THE PODCAST,

16:23.182 --> 16:28.887

16:28.954 --> 16:31.423
BARI WEISS IS OVER HERE.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.393
OKAY.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.060
[APPLAUSE]

16:35.127 --> 16:37.062
YOU HEARD WHAT I WAS BITCHING

16:37.129 --> 16:37.796
ABOUT IN THE MONOLOGUE, THERE'S

16:37.863 --> 16:39.631
A BIT OF A RESET IN THE WORLD

16:39.698 --> 16:40.632
ABOUT COVID, I'VE BEEN ASKING

16:40.699 --> 16:42.067
FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.502
IN EUROPE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE

16:43.569 --> 16:44.837
ARE SAYING WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH

16:44.903 --> 16:45.003
IT.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.807
BORIS JOHNSON SAID IT, WE HAVE

16:48.874 --> 16:51.276
TO LIVE WITH IT, TREAT IT LIKE

16:51.343 --> 16:51.510
THE FLU.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.177
SOME OF THE THINGS THEY ARE

16:52.244 --> 16:53.445
DOING IN THE U.K. THAT THEY ARE

16:53.512 --> 16:56.715
NOT DOING ANYWHERE, THEY ARE

16:56.782 --> 16:59.251
ENDING MANDATING FACE MASKS,

16:59.318 --> 17:01.220
MASKS IN SCHOOL, THAT'S GONE,

17:01.286 --> 17:03.021
WORK FROM HOME ADVISORIES, NO,

17:03.088 --> 17:04.590
MENTOR PASSPORTS TO GET INTO

17:04.656 --> 17:06.725
NIGHTCLUBS AND LARGE EVENTS.

17:06.792 --> 17:07.292
A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO SELF

17:07.359 --> 17:09.428
ISOLATE, NO.

17:09.495 --> 17:12.598
THEY ARE GETTING BACK TO NORMAL.

17:12.664 --> 17:13.465
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THIS?

17:13.532 --> 17:17.069
I THINK, WHAT DO YOU THINK.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.271
>> SHOULD I LEAVE IT TO THE

17:19.338 --> 17:19.671
CONGRESSMAN FIRST?

17:19.738 --> 17:21.407
>> I THINK WE'VE BEEN GRADUALLY

17:21.473 --> 17:22.040
TRANSITIONING TO NORMAL IN THE

17:22.107 --> 17:24.209
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES BECOME

17:24.276 --> 17:25.677
LESTER KONY IN A MORE MEASURED

17:25.744 --> 17:26.678
OVER TIME AS THE PANDEMIC HAS

17:26.745 --> 17:27.446
BECOME MORE MEASURABLE AND THAT

17:27.513 --> 17:30.115
IS BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF

17:30.182 --> 17:31.817
THE VACCINATION CAMPAIGN FOR THE

17:31.884 --> 17:32.551
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS

17:32.618 --> 17:34.653
PROVIDED OVER THE VACCINATION

17:34.720 --> 17:36.388
OF MORE THAN 2 MILLION

17:36.455 --> 17:37.656
AMERICANS, WHICH HAS BEEN

17:37.723 --> 17:37.923
EFFECTIVE.

17:37.990 --> 17:38.257
>> Bill: OKAY.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.860
[APPLAUSE]

17:41.927 --> 17:42.161
>> I'M DONE.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.597
>> Bill: WITH THIS QUESTION?

17:45.664 --> 17:46.365
[LAUGHS]

17:46.432 --> 17:48.434
>> NO, WITH COVID, I'M DONE.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.902
I WENT SO HARD WITH COVID.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.470
>> Bill: I REMEMBER.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.338
>> I SPRAYED THE PRINGLES CANS

17:53.405 --> 17:54.706
OF THE GROCERY STORE, I STRIP MY

17:54.773 --> 17:55.441
CLOTHES OFF BECAUSE I THOUGHT

17:55.507 --> 17:58.477
COVID WOULD BE ON MY CLOTHES.

17:58.544 --> 18:01.046
I DID IT ALL, I WATCHED

18:01.113 --> 18:02.381
"TIGER KING," I GOT TO THE END

18:02.448 --> 18:03.649
OF SPOTIFY.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.184
WE ALL DID IT, RIGHT?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.686
>> Bill: NO, WE DIDN'T ALL DO

18:07.753 --> 18:07.853
IT.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.588
>> A LOT OF US DID DO IT AND

18:09.655 --> 18:10.722
THEN WE WERE TOLD YOU GET THE

18:10.789 --> 18:12.858
VACCINE AND YOU GET BACK TO

18:12.925 --> 18:14.860
NORMAL.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.495
AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN BACK TO

18:16.562 --> 18:19.031
NORMAL AND IT'S RIDICULOUS AT

18:19.097 --> 18:19.565
THIS POINT.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.800
I KNOW THAT SO MANY OF MY

18:21.867 --> 18:22.701
LIBERAL AND PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS

18:22.768 --> 18:23.435
ARE WITH ME ON THIS AND THEY DO

18:23.502 --> 18:25.103
NOT WANT TO SAY IT OUT LOUD

18:25.170 --> 18:29.975
BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED TO BE

18:30.042 --> 18:32.110
CALLED ANTI-VAX OR BE CALLED

18:32.177 --> 18:34.012
SCIENCE DENIAL OR SMEARED AS A

18:34.079 --> 18:34.246
TRUMPER.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.081
I'M SORRY, IF YOU BELIEVE THE

18:36.148 --> 18:37.149
SCIENCE YOU WILL LOOK AT THE

18:37.216 --> 18:38.684
DATA WE DID NOT HAVE TWO YEARS

18:38.750 --> 18:42.020
AGO AND YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT

18:42.087 --> 18:43.989
CLOTH MASKS DO NOT DO ANYTHING.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.090
YOU WILL REALIZE THAT YOU CAN

18:45.157 --> 18:48.227
SHOW YOUR VACCINE PASSPORT AT A

18:48.293 --> 18:49.761
RESTAURANT AND STILL BE A

18:49.828 --> 18:51.196
SYMPTOMATIC AND CARRYING

18:51.263 --> 18:51.563
OMICRON.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.564
AND YOU WILL REALIZE MOST

18:52.631 --> 18:53.599
IMPORTANTLY THAT THIS IS GOING

18:53.665 --> 18:59.238
TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE YOUNGER

18:59.304 --> 18:59.838
GENERATION AS A CATASTROPHIC

18:59.905 --> 19:00.138
MORAL CRIME.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.074
THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN,

19:02.140 --> 19:03.642
WHICH IS 80% I THINK MINORITY

19:03.709 --> 19:06.011
STUDENTS HAS JUST ANNOUNCED

19:06.078 --> 19:07.880
INDEFINITE VIRTUAL SCHOOLING.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.147
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE

19:09.214 --> 19:11.116
SEEN AMONG YOUNG GIRLS A 51%

19:11.183 --> 19:14.653
INCREASE IN SELF HARM.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.787
PEOPLE ARE KILLING THEMSELVES,

19:15.854 --> 19:17.055
THEY ARE ANXIOUS, THEY ARE

19:17.122 --> 19:18.056
DEPRESSED, THEY ARE LONELY.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.559
THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO END IT,

19:20.626 --> 19:21.560
MORE THAN ANY INCONVENIENCE IT'S

19:21.627 --> 19:23.228
BEEN TO THE REST OF US --

19:23.295 --> 19:26.565
[APPLAUSE]

19:26.632 --> 19:29.034
IT'S A PANDEMIC, AT THIS POINT

19:29.101 --> 19:30.669
IT'S A PANDEMIC OF BUREAUCRACY.

19:30.736 --> 19:31.670
IT'S A PANDEMIC OF BUREAUCRACY,

19:31.737 --> 19:33.705
IT'S NOT REAL ANYMORE.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.374
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE

19:35.440 --> 19:36.275
PANDEMIC HAS LEFT THE DEATH

19:36.341 --> 19:40.178
COUNT OF MORE THAN 850,000

19:40.245 --> 19:40.479
AMERICANS --

19:40.546 --> 19:41.113
>> Bill: WELL, THAT'S --

19:41.179 --> 19:42.748
>> BUT IT WAS A BLUNT

19:42.814 --> 19:44.349
INSTRUMENT, OKAY?

19:44.416 --> 19:45.918
IF YOU LOOK AT WHO WAS AFFECTED

19:45.984 --> 19:48.387
BY THIS, 803 CHILDREN HAVE DIED

19:48.453 --> 19:50.589
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THE

19:50.656 --> 19:52.090
ENTIRE COUNTRY FROM AND WITH

19:52.157 --> 19:52.291
COVID.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.492
>> I GUESS I OFFER A

19:53.559 --> 19:55.827
PERSPECTIVE, I WAS A NEW YORKER

19:55.894 --> 19:56.495
WHO LIVED THROUGH THE EARLY

19:56.562 --> 19:58.330
WEEKS AND EARLY MONTHS OF THE

19:58.397 --> 19:59.565
PANDEMIC AND IT WAS JUST A

19:59.631 --> 20:00.198
CATASTROPHE FOR NEW YORK CITY,

20:00.265 --> 20:01.900
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE'VE NEVER

20:01.967 --> 20:03.735
SEEN.

20:03.802 --> 20:05.170
WE SAW OVERFLOWING EMERGENCY

20:05.237 --> 20:06.705
ROOMS, NEW YORK LOST MORE THAN

20:06.772 --> 20:08.473
60,000 PEOPLE, THE BRONX ALONE

20:08.540 --> 20:09.942
WAS MORE THAN 7,000 PEOPLE WHICH

20:10.008 --> 20:12.077
IS LARGER THAN THE COMBINED

20:12.144 --> 20:12.945
DEATH TOLL OF PEARL HARBOR AND

20:13.011 --> 20:16.381
9/11.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.083
I SAW RAIDS IN THE BRONX, MOST

20:18.150 --> 20:19.585
NEW ORLEANS AND SAW A LEVEL OF

20:19.651 --> 20:20.419
DEATH AND SUFFERING WE'VE NEVER

20:20.485 --> 20:22.220
SEEN IN OUR LIVES.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.589
AND THAT'S THE SOURCE ABOUT THE

20:23.655 --> 20:24.590
CONCERN FOR COVID.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.258
I REJECT THE NOTION THAT THE

20:26.325 --> 20:27.926
RESPONSE TO COVID HAS BEEN WORSE

20:27.993 --> 20:28.427
THAN THE DISEASE ITSELF.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.595
[APPLAUSE]

20:29.661 --> 20:34.266
>> Bill: WELL, I WOULD ARGUE

20:34.333 --> 20:34.900
WITH THAT.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.635
I MEAN, I ASK FOR THE COVID

20:36.702 --> 20:38.437
DEATHS BY STATES.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.172
THIS IS PER 100,000 PEOPLE, THE

20:40.238 --> 20:42.374
WORST IS MISSISSIPPI.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.878
MY HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY,

20:46.945 --> 20:47.546
FOUR, FOURTH WORST.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.149
NEW YORK, SIXTH WORST.

20:51.216 --> 20:55.153
WEST VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS

20:55.220 --> 20:56.355
ARE 10 AND 11 RIGHT TOGETHER.

20:56.421 --> 20:56.955
COULD THERE BE TWO STATES WHO

20:57.022 --> 21:00.058
ARE MORE UNALIKE THAN

21:00.125 --> 21:01.093
WEST VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS?

21:01.159 --> 21:02.628
AND THE POSTER BOY FOR KEEPING

21:02.694 --> 21:04.930
SHIT OPEN WAS FLORIDA.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.199
THEY ARE DOWN AT 17.

21:07.265 --> 21:08.000
SO NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY DID

21:08.066 --> 21:10.869
WORSE THAN FLORIDA.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.837
WHAT I'M SAYING IS --

21:11.903 --> 21:15.607
>> WE DID WORSE BECAUSE WE ARE A

21:15.674 --> 21:17.109
DENSELY POPULATED HUB OF

21:17.175 --> 21:17.576
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL.

21:17.643 --> 21:17.843
[APPLAUSE]

21:17.909 --> 21:19.411
>> Bill: FLORIDA IS HOME TO

21:19.478 --> 21:22.247
ALL THE OLD PEOPLE IN AMERICA,

21:22.314 --> 21:23.115
SO MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE --

21:23.181 --> 21:25.417
>> BUT THE DATA IS CRYSTAL

21:25.484 --> 21:26.818
CLEAR, THIS IS BEYOND DISPUTE

21:26.885 --> 21:27.853
THAT THE DEATHS AND

21:27.919 --> 21:28.453
HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE BEEN

21:28.520 --> 21:30.756
OVERWHELMINGLY CONCENTRATED

21:30.822 --> 21:31.523
AMONG THE UNVACCINATED.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.060
IF YOU ARE FULLY VACCINATED --

21:35.127 --> 21:35.360
>> YES.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.630
>> YOU HAVE A FAR LOWER RISK OF

21:38.697 --> 21:39.631
HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH.

21:39.698 --> 21:40.832
>> Bill: BUT THAT IS NOT EVEN

21:40.899 --> 21:42.801
THE ISSUE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.069
WE WILL GET TO THIS.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.070
BUT FLORIDA STAYED OPEN.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.605
I WAS JUST IN FLORIDA, I'VE BEEN

21:46.672 --> 21:48.540
THERE A FEW TIMES SINCE THIS

21:48.607 --> 21:48.774
STARTED.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.276
>> HALF OF NEW YORK HAS MOVED

21:51.343 --> 21:51.476
THERE.

21:51.543 --> 21:52.044
>> Bill: THE ATMOSPHERE IS

21:52.110 --> 21:52.411
JUST DIFFERENT.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.447
I'M NOT MOVING TO FLORIDA, I'M

21:55.514 --> 21:56.181
NOT PROMOTING FLORIDA.

21:56.248 --> 21:56.748
I'M JUST SAYING AOC WENT TO

21:56.815 --> 21:59.785
FLORIDA AND HAD A GOOD TIME

21:59.851 --> 22:00.452
WITHOUT A MASK HUGGING PEOPLE

22:00.519 --> 22:02.421
APPEAR TO LOOK LIKE SHE HAD A

22:02.487 --> 22:02.954
BLAST.

22:03.021 --> 22:03.588
>> Bill: I'M JUST SAYING I'VE

22:03.655 --> 22:05.424
BEEN TO FLORIDA AND THE

22:05.490 --> 22:06.458
ATMOSPHERE WAS NIGHT AND DAY TO

22:06.525 --> 22:09.227
CALIFORNIA, WHICH WAS GLOOMY,

22:09.294 --> 22:10.529
AND THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN WAS OUT

22:10.595 --> 22:12.030
THERE.

22:12.097 --> 22:12.264
[LAUGHS]

22:12.330 --> 22:13.598
AND YOU WENT OUT THERE AND I'M

22:13.665 --> 22:15.567
JUST SAYING YES, THERE WERE

22:15.634 --> 22:17.002
DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT BASICALLY,

22:17.069 --> 22:19.237
IT'S LIKE THEY STAYED OPEN AND

22:19.304 --> 22:21.640
WENT ON WITH LIFE AND THEY

22:21.707 --> 22:23.842
DIDN'T DO A HELL OF A LOT WORSE

22:23.909 --> 22:24.309
AND MAYBE DID BETTER.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.477
[APPLAUSE]

22:25.544 --> 22:27.379
AS FAR AS YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT

22:27.446 --> 22:29.881
THE VACCINES, WHAT IS SO

22:29.948 --> 22:31.917
DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE WERE TWO

22:31.983 --> 22:34.119
MONTHS AGO THE LAST TIME I SAT

22:34.186 --> 22:35.987
HERE IS THAT WE NOW KNOW THE

22:36.054 --> 22:38.190
VACCINE DOES NOT STOP YOU FROM

22:38.256 --> 22:38.957
GETTING IT.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.826
I FOUND THAT OUT WHEN I GOT IT.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.260
I MEAN, I GOT IT AND EVERYONE

22:42.327 --> 22:44.463
WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD, HOW DID

22:44.529 --> 22:44.863
YOU GET IT?

22:44.930 --> 22:45.664
I GOT THE VACCINE.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.166
I GUESS I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

22:48.233 --> 22:49.000
TO KNOW EVERYONE HAS IT.

22:49.067 --> 22:49.868
IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM GETTING

22:49.935 --> 22:52.404
IT AND IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM

22:52.471 --> 22:54.239
TRANSMITTING IT.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.974
IT STOPS YOU FROM DYING WHEN YOU

22:56.041 --> 22:56.208
DO GET.

22:56.274 --> 22:57.976
>> THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD REASON

22:58.043 --> 22:58.410
TO TAKE THE VACCINE.

22:58.477 --> 22:59.544
>> Bill: I'M NOT SAYING THAT

22:59.611 --> 23:02.914
IS NOT A REASON TO GET IT, I'M

23:02.981 --> 23:05.083
JUST SAYING IT'S A HUGE

23:05.150 --> 23:05.684
DIFFERENCE AND IT COUNTERACTS

23:05.751 --> 23:07.786
THE ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED THE

23:07.853 --> 23:09.421
VACCINE TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE

23:09.488 --> 23:10.622
IT JUST PROTECTS YOU.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.190
IT DOESN'T PROTECT YOU FROM ME,

23:12.257 --> 23:13.258
DOESN'T PROTECT ME FROM GETTING

23:13.325 --> 23:14.259
IT, IT PROTECTS YOU.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.228
SO IT'S JUST REALLY ABOUT YOU

23:16.294 --> 23:16.762
NOW.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.396
SPEAK UP AT THE MAIN POINT IS

23:18.463 --> 23:19.865
EVERY ADULT IN AMERICA HAS HAD

23:19.931 --> 23:21.833
ACCESS TO THIS VACCINE FOR MORE.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.636
OBVIOUSLY, I RAN TO GET IT THE

23:24.703 --> 23:25.637
SECOND I COULD, PROBABLY A

23:25.704 --> 23:26.805
SECOND BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE.

23:26.872 --> 23:29.374
BUT THE POINT IS IF YOU ARE

23:29.441 --> 23:31.143
CHOOSING NOT TO GET IT, WHICH I

23:31.209 --> 23:33.211
THINK IS A FOOLISH DECISION, WE

23:33.278 --> 23:34.379
ARE NOT STOPPING THE WORLD FOR

23:34.446 --> 23:35.747
THE SAKE OF THOSE FOOLISH PEOPLE

23:35.814 --> 23:36.815
IN THE SAME WAY WE WOULDN'T

23:36.882 --> 23:38.450
INTERVENE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

23:38.517 --> 23:40.018
LIKE ME WANT TO EAT A BIG MAC

23:40.085 --> 23:40.285
EVERY DAY.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.853
[APPLAUSE]

23:41.920 --> 23:44.122
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW WE CAN

23:44.189 --> 23:45.323
PROCEED.

23:45.390 --> 23:49.427
>> Bill: AND ABOUT THE SCIENCE

23:49.494 --> 23:50.729
SCIENCE, PEOPLE, THIS IS I THINK

23:50.796 --> 23:51.363
WERE DEMOCRATS LOOK BAD.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.198
WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF SCIENCE,

23:53.265 --> 23:54.432
AND THEN A LOT OF WHAT THEY DO

23:54.499 --> 23:56.802
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE,

23:56.868 --> 23:59.337
LIKE SUGGESTING YOU WEAR MASKS

23:59.404 --> 23:59.571
OUTSIDE.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.039
THERE IS NO SCIENCE TO THAT.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.008
>> OR PRESCHOOLERS HAVING TO BE

24:03.074 --> 24:09.981
FITTED FOR A SPECIAL KN95 MASK.

24:10.048 --> 24:11.650
>> Bill: OR THAT THE VIRUS CAN

24:11.716 --> 24:12.918
GET ME WHEN I'M WALKING IN A

24:12.984 --> 24:13.451
RESTAURANT BUT NOT WHEN I'M

24:13.518 --> 24:15.320
SITTING DOWN.

24:15.387 --> 24:15.587
[APPLAUSE]

24:15.654 --> 24:18.957
THERE IS SO MUCH MINDLESS

24:19.024 --> 24:19.257
BUREAUCRACY.

24:19.324 --> 24:20.025
KAI RE-IRVING CAN PLAY ON THE

24:20.091 --> 24:20.258
ROAD

24:20.325 --> 24:22.327
BUT NOT HOME GAMES.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.362
IT'S JUST STUPID.

24:24.429 --> 24:26.431
>> TO ME THERE IS NO GREATER

24:26.498 --> 24:27.632
ASSAULT ON SCIENCE THAN THE

24:27.699 --> 24:29.734
ATTEMPT TO G LEGITIMIZE

24:29.801 --> 24:30.101
VACCINATION.

24:30.168 --> 24:33.171
IF WE ARE NOT FOR VACCINATION,

24:33.238 --> 24:36.007
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE ERADICATED

24:36.074 --> 24:36.675
POLIO IN THE UNITED STATES --

24:36.741 --> 24:38.009
>> OF COURSE.

24:38.076 --> 24:38.677
>> Bill: NO ONE IS ARGUING

24:38.743 --> 24:40.846
THAT'S.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.380
>> TRUMP HAS GOTTEN THE BOOSTER.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.983
>> HE IS EXCEPTION, APPARENTLY

24:45.050 --> 24:46.918
HE'S MORE RATIONAL ON VACCINES

24:46.985 --> 24:48.854
THAN THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN

24:48.920 --> 24:49.187
PARTY.

24:49.254 --> 24:49.988
>> Bill: THE SUPREME COURT

24:50.055 --> 24:50.789
JUST RULED ON THIS AND WHEN WE

24:50.856 --> 24:53.625
FOUND OUT WHAT SOME OF THE

24:53.692 --> 24:54.192
JUSTICES SAID --

24:54.259 --> 24:56.328
>> THEY WERE LISTENING TO NPR

24:56.394 --> 24:56.728
ALL THE TIME.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.430
>> Bill: IT SHOWED THEY WERE

24:58.496 --> 25:00.031
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER LIBERAL OR

25:00.098 --> 25:00.832
CONSERVATIVE, THEY ALL LISTEN TO

25:00.899 --> 25:05.036
THEIR OWN MEDIA ZONES, AND

25:05.103 --> 25:07.005
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR SAID WE HAD

25:07.072 --> 25:08.206
OVER 100,000 CHILDREN IN SERIOUS

25:08.273 --> 25:08.673
CONDITION AND MANY ON

25:08.740 --> 25:10.976
VENTILATORS AT A TIME WHEN THERE

25:11.042 --> 25:12.077
WERE FEWER THAN 5,000.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.613
SHE ALSO SAID IT WAS A

25:14.679 --> 25:15.814
BLOOD-BORNE VIRUS.

25:15.881 --> 25:16.615
BLOOD-BORNE VIRUS?

25:16.681 --> 25:18.583
I MEAN THAT IS REALLY IGNORANT

25:18.650 --> 25:19.217
FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, SO

25:19.284 --> 25:20.919
DON'T BE THE WE ARE THE PEOPLE

25:20.986 --> 25:21.519
WHO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE BUT

25:21.586 --> 25:24.189
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FACTS.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.991
I READ THIS BEFORE, LIKE 41% OF

25:26.057 --> 25:29.594
DEMOCRATS LAST YEAR THOUGHT THAT

25:29.661 --> 25:31.496
OVER 50% OF PEOPLE WHO GOT COVID

25:31.563 --> 25:32.764
WAS HOSPITALIZED.

25:32.831 --> 25:33.999
IT WAS LESS THAN 1%.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.268
>> BUT I'M SORRY, IF YOU'RE

25:36.334 --> 25:38.637
WATCHING CABLE NEWS ALL DAY --

25:38.703 --> 25:39.004
>> Bill: RIGHT.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.438
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

25:40.505 --> 25:40.972
THINK.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.140
THERE'S THIS INFORMATION, NOT

25:42.207 --> 25:43.408
JUST ON PODCAST AND THE

25:43.475 --> 25:43.675
INTERNET.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.578
IT'S ALSO ON CABLE NEWS.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.546
THE BIGGEST THING ABOUT THE

25:48.613 --> 25:49.247
DEMOCRATS IS PRESENT COMPANY

25:49.314 --> 25:50.515
EXCLUDED, I THINK IS AMAZING AND

25:50.582 --> 25:52.384
I HOPE THE FUTURE OF THE

25:52.450 --> 25:54.886
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THIS MAN.

25:54.953 --> 25:57.422
>> Bill: HE'S TRYING TO TOE

25:57.489 --> 25:57.822
THE LINE TONIGHT.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.357
[APPLAUSE]

25:59.424 --> 26:00.492
>> BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE

26:00.558 --> 26:01.793
DEMOCRATS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE

26:01.860 --> 26:02.560
PARTY OF THE LITTLE GUY PEERED

26:02.627 --> 26:03.795
AT THEIR BEST THAT IS WHAT THEY

26:03.862 --> 26:04.963
ARE ABOUT.

26:05.030 --> 26:05.931
YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

26:05.997 --> 26:07.432
NOW COMFORTABLE WITH OR

26:07.499 --> 26:08.333
SEEMINGLY COMFORTABLE WITH?

26:08.400 --> 26:13.438
A TWO TIERED SYSTEM IN WHICH THE

26:13.505 --> 26:14.806
HAVES GET TO GO INTO A

26:14.873 --> 26:17.042
RESTAURANT AND LAUGH WITH THEIR

26:17.108 --> 26:18.677
FRIENDS FOR TWO HOURS AND THEIR

26:18.743 --> 26:20.011
FRIENDS SERVING THEM ARE MASK

26:20.078 --> 26:20.712
AND WEARING GLOVES.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.414
WHEN THEY GET TO WALK LIKE AOC

26:22.480 --> 26:24.182
DID AT THE MET GALA WHERE IN THE

26:24.249 --> 26:25.150
BACKGROUND THE STAFF LOOKED LIKE

26:25.216 --> 26:26.117
THEY WERE IN THE HANDS MADE

26:26.184 --> 26:28.053
TAIL.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.287
THIS IS A LOOK THAT IS

26:29.354 --> 26:34.759
UNBELIEVABLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE

26:34.826 --> 26:34.960
THEM.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.461
>> Bill: AND THE JOBS COME OF

26:36.528 --> 26:38.196
THE PEOPLE WITH THE CONSULTING

26:38.263 --> 26:39.264
JOBS OR WHATEVER OTHER BULLSHIT

26:39.331 --> 26:40.799
THEY DO, THEY GET TO STAY AT

26:40.865 --> 26:43.101
HOME IN ORDER OUT AND DO SHIT BY

26:43.168 --> 26:45.704
ZOOM WHERE IS THE WORKING, IT'S

26:45.770 --> 26:47.639
THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO ARE

26:47.706 --> 26:49.674
BREEDING THEIR SHITTY STALE AIR

26:49.741 --> 26:51.876
ALL DAY.

26:51.943 --> 26:52.143
[APPLAUSE]

26:52.210 --> 26:52.744
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO

26:52.811 --> 26:55.847
CREATE A CLASS RESENTMENT.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.582
IT LOOKS LIKE THE LIBERALS ARE

26:57.649 --> 26:58.683
ALWAYS SUGGESTING SACRIFICES

26:58.750 --> 26:59.284
THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE TO

26:59.351 --> 27:01.186
TAKE PART IN.

27:01.252 --> 27:03.822
>> I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE WORST OF

27:03.888 --> 27:04.723
COVID IS BEHIND US.

27:04.789 --> 27:04.990
[LAUGHTER]

27:05.056 --> 27:08.626
>> Bill: THIS GUY.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.130
[LAUGHS]

27:12.197 --> 27:13.064
I'M GLAD YOU NEVER FORGET YOU

27:13.131 --> 27:16.668
ARE IN CONGRESS!

27:16.735 --> 27:19.237
>> THERE WILL NEVER BE AN

27:19.304 --> 27:19.971
ERADICATION OF COVID BUT IT WILL

27:20.038 --> 27:23.108
BECOME ENDEMIC, IT WILL BECOME

27:23.174 --> 27:23.742
NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SEASONAL

27:23.808 --> 27:25.510
FLU AND THERE WILL BE A RETURN

27:25.577 --> 27:25.777
TO NORMAL.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.780
>> Bill: OKAY, WE ARE HOPEFUL

27:28.847 --> 27:29.014
OF THAT.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.484
THE DEMOCRATS, AND AGAIN, WE ARE

27:32.550 --> 27:33.018
SHITTING AT THE DEMOCRATS

27:33.084 --> 27:33.785
BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO GET

27:33.852 --> 27:36.121
BETTER NOT BECAUSE WE WANT THEM

27:36.187 --> 27:37.088
TO LOSE.

27:37.155 --> 27:42.861
IN THE YEAR 2021, 14-POINT SWING

27:42.927 --> 27:43.862
IN THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.497
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR IT

27:45.563 --> 27:47.365
WAS DEMOCRATS PLUS NINE.

27:47.432 --> 27:50.402
AT THE END OF THE YEAR IT WAS

27:50.468 --> 27:51.036
REPUBLICANS PLUS FIVE.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.370
I'VE NEVER SEEN A SWING LIKE

27:52.437 --> 27:53.038
THAT IN A SINGLE YEAR.

27:53.104 --> 27:56.408
SOME OF THAT HAS TO BE COVID.

27:56.474 --> 27:58.276
SOME OF THAT I ALSO THINK IS

27:58.343 --> 27:58.476
CRIME.

27:58.543 --> 28:00.011
LET'S TALK ABOUT CRIME FOR A

28:00.078 --> 28:01.980
MINUTE, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

28:02.047 --> 28:03.615
CRIMES THAT ARE NOW, I KNOW THIS

28:03.681 --> 28:04.616
IS A BIG ISSUE IN NEW YORK.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.484
I READ THE LOCAL PAPER THERE.

28:06.551 --> 28:10.622
OKAY, THE D.A. FIGHTING WITH THE

28:10.688 --> 28:14.392
NEW MAYOR BECAUSE THE MAYOR WON

28:14.459 --> 28:15.794
ON A LET'S STOP CRIME PROGRAM.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.261
NOT JUST NEW YORK.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.496
SOME OF THE THINGS -- OH, WE

28:18.563 --> 28:22.801
HAVE IT ON THE SCREEN.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.735
PROGRESSIVE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

28:23.802 --> 28:25.804
ARE PROSECUTING ANYMORE, LARCENY

28:25.870 --> 28:28.006
UNDER $250, ROBBERY OF THE GUN

28:28.073 --> 28:30.575
ISN'T LOADED, SHOPLIFTING,

28:30.642 --> 28:32.410
TRESPASSING, IF A MINOR IS IN

28:32.477 --> 28:35.847
POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL, WANTON OR

28:35.914 --> 28:37.148
MALICIOUS OBSTRUCTION OF

28:37.215 --> 28:38.783
PROPERTY, FARE EVASION,

28:38.850 --> 28:42.120
DISTURBING THE PEACE, DISORDERLY

28:42.187 --> 28:44.022
CONDUCT, STOLEN PROPERTY, IT

28:44.089 --> 28:44.923
GOES ON AND ON.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.724
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, RIGHTLY

28:46.791 --> 28:48.093
OR WRONGLY, THEY ARE SEEING

28:48.159 --> 28:48.960
PEOPLE OVER REACTED IN 2020

28:49.027 --> 28:51.362
AFTER THE HEINOUS CRIME OF THE

28:51.429 --> 28:54.499
MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD, THEN

28:54.566 --> 28:55.600
THEY SAY THERE WAS AN

28:55.667 --> 28:56.601
OVERREACTION DISBANDING THE

28:56.668 --> 28:58.169
POLICE, A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

28:58.236 --> 28:58.369
THAT.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.038
AND WHO IS GOING TO GET BLAMED

29:00.105 --> 29:00.505
FOR ALL THIS?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.807
NOT THE REPUBLICANS.

29:02.874 --> 29:06.544
LET ME READ THE QUOTE FROM

29:06.611 --> 29:07.312
LONDON BREED, THE MAYOR IN TAMPA

29:07.378 --> 29:07.812
DISCO.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.147
I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN AMAZING

29:09.214 --> 29:11.449
QUOTE, "IT'S TIME THE RAIN OF

29:11.516 --> 29:12.917
CRIMINALS WHO ARE DESTROYING OUR

29:12.984 --> 29:13.651
CITIES COME TO AN END AND IT

29:13.718 --> 29:16.554
COMES TO AN END WHEN WE TAKE THE

29:16.621 --> 29:17.956
STEP OF BEING LESS TOLERANT OF

29:18.022 --> 29:19.023
ALL THE BULLSHIT THAT HAS

29:19.090 --> 29:21.559
DESTROYED OUR CITY."

29:21.626 --> 29:22.160
[APPLAUSE]

29:22.227 --> 29:24.496
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK LIKE A REAL

29:24.562 --> 29:24.963
PERSON!

29:25.029 --> 29:27.031
YOU SAY THE WORD "BULLSHIT."

29:27.098 --> 29:28.199
>> BUT THE REASON THAT IS SUCH

29:28.266 --> 29:30.668
AN IMPORTANT BELLWETHER IS IF

29:30.735 --> 29:32.070
YOU WIND BACK THE CLOCK TO 2020,

29:32.137 --> 29:35.640
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT BEING SOFT

29:35.707 --> 29:37.175
ON CRIME AND DEFINING THE

29:37.242 --> 29:40.578
POLICE, SHE WAS RUNNING AROUND

29:40.645 --> 29:41.012
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

29:41.079 --> 29:41.813
>> Bill: OH, REALLY?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.581
>> AND THE SWITCH IS A GREAT,

29:43.648 --> 29:44.816
GREAT A SIGN ABOUT WHERE SHE

29:44.883 --> 29:46.584
THINKS HER BASE IS AND WHERE SHE

29:46.651 --> 29:48.353
THINKS THE COMMON SENSE APPROACH

29:48.419 --> 29:49.254
IS.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.755
SHE HAS NOW DECLARED AN

29:50.822 --> 29:51.956
EMERGENCY AREA IN THE TENDERLOIN

29:52.023 --> 29:55.126
DISTRICT, WHICH LOOKS LIKE, I

29:55.193 --> 29:56.227
MEAN, ANTI-CIVILIZATION TO WALK

29:56.294 --> 29:56.427
THERE.

29:56.494 --> 29:57.862
AND THERE ARE PARTS OF L.A. THAT

29:57.929 --> 29:58.563
LOOKED JUST THE SAME PEER TO

29:58.630 --> 29:59.831
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE

29:59.898 --> 30:04.035
SAME SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THE D.A. N

30:04.102 --> 30:05.036
NEW YORK AND ERIC ADAMS, THE CO.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.273
BUT IT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

30:08.339 --> 30:09.574
RECALL OF -- IN SAN FRANCISCO.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.208
IT'S HAPPENING IN PHILADELPHIA.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.410
THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN

30:12.477 --> 30:13.211
SAN FRANCISCO AND WE WERE

30:13.278 --> 30:14.078
WALKING IN A BEAUTIFUL PARK AND

30:14.145 --> 30:16.147
THERE WAS A SIGN THAT SAID "THIS

30:16.214 --> 30:17.815
IS A CARJACKING AREA.

30:17.882 --> 30:20.018
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE

30:20.084 --> 30:20.585
EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR CAR.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.987
>> Bill: WHO PUT THE SIGN UP?

30:23.054 --> 30:26.157
>> THIS WAS A GOVERNMENT SIGN

30:26.224 --> 30:26.324
UP.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.091
>> Bill: NO.

30:27.158 --> 30:27.725
>> ABSOLUTELY.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.326
>> Bill: THE GOVERNMENT PUT UP

30:28.393 --> 30:31.596
A SIGN THAT SAID THIS IS A

30:31.663 --> 30:32.630
CARJACKING AREA?

30:32.697 --> 30:33.698
WHAT ABOUT THE ALTERNATE SIDE OF

30:33.765 --> 30:34.566
THE STREET?

30:34.632 --> 30:34.999
THAT IS STILL OKAY.

30:35.066 --> 30:37.569
[APPLAUSE]

30:37.635 --> 30:38.336
THAT IS CRAZY.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.738
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE '70s IN

30:40.805 --> 30:42.173
NEW YORK WHEN THE THIEVES WOULD

30:42.240 --> 30:43.107
PUT A SIGN OR PEOPLE WOULD PUT

30:43.174 --> 30:45.677
UP THE SIGN FOR THE THIEVES --

30:45.743 --> 30:47.579
>> NOTHING IN THE CAR.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.614
>> Bill: NO RADIO, THANK YOU.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.549
THEY WOULD THANK THE THIEVES FOR

30:51.616 --> 30:51.950
NOT ROBBING THEM.

30:52.016 --> 30:52.650
>> THE SOFT ON CRIME CRITIQUE IS

30:52.717 --> 30:57.922
MORE OF A CARICATURE THAN A FAIR

30:57.989 --> 31:01.125
CARICHARACTERIZATION OF WHERE MT

31:01.192 --> 31:01.492
DEMOCRATS STAND.

31:01.559 --> 31:02.227
>> Bill: MOST.

31:02.293 --> 31:02.927
>> WE HAVE THEORIES ABOUT THE

31:02.994 --> 31:04.596
CRIME WAVE AND WE GRAVITATE

31:04.662 --> 31:07.465
TOWARDS THE THEORIES THAT HOLD

31:07.532 --> 31:11.035
TRUE TO OUR OWN BIASES.

31:11.102 --> 31:12.403
THE SIMPLEST EXULTATION IS

31:12.470 --> 31:13.738
PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE SIMPLE

31:13.805 --> 31:14.973
X DONATION IS WHEN YOU HAVE MORE

31:15.039 --> 31:16.507
GUNS ON THE STREET YOU WILL HAVE

31:16.574 --> 31:16.908
MORE GUN VIOLENCE.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.109
[APPLAUSE]

31:18.176 --> 31:20.511
YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE DURING

31:20.578 --> 31:23.915
COVID, MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING

31:23.982 --> 31:25.650
GUNS THAN EVER BEFORE, MORE

31:25.717 --> 31:28.219
PEOPLE ARE CARRYING GUNS THAN

31:28.286 --> 31:30.088
EVER BEFORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE

31:30.154 --> 31:31.322
ASSEMBLING GUNS AT HOME THAN

31:31.389 --> 31:31.889
EVER BEFORE AND POLICE

31:31.956 --> 31:32.490
DEPARTMENT WILL TELL YOU THEY

31:32.557 --> 31:35.927
ARE FINDING MORE GUNS FLOWING

31:35.994 --> 31:36.861
INTEREST RATES THAN EVER BEFORE.

31:36.928 --> 31:37.829
>> Bill: THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT

31:37.895 --> 31:38.997
THAT IS NOT REALLY WHAT THIS

31:39.063 --> 31:39.764
CRIME IS ALL ABOUT.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.366
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE GOING INTO

31:41.432 --> 31:44.435
TARGETS AND STORES LIKE THAT AND

31:44.502 --> 31:46.571
JUST ROBBING THEM AND NO ONE IS

31:46.638 --> 31:46.904
STOPPING THEM.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.306
>> BECAUSE IF THE GOVERNMENT

31:48.373 --> 31:49.574
ANNOUNCES OR A D.A. IN THE CITY

31:49.641 --> 31:51.075
ANNOUNCES LIKE SUMMER IN

31:51.142 --> 31:52.744
SAN FRANCISCO, YOU CAN STILL

31:52.810 --> 31:53.611
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WITH OF

31:53.678 --> 31:54.445
STUFF AT WALGREENS AND NOTHING

31:54.512 --> 31:55.413
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU, THAT IS WHY

31:55.480 --> 32:00.351
THERE IS PRIVATE SECURITY AT

32:00.418 --> 32:00.985
WALGREENS BEHIND LOCK AND KEY.

32:01.052 --> 32:01.252
[APPLAUSE]

32:01.319 --> 32:03.988
>> NO.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.523
NEW YORK CITY HAS FIVE DISTRICT

32:05.590 --> 32:05.857
ATTORNEYS.

32:05.923 --> 32:06.491
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DISTRICT

32:06.557 --> 32:09.761
ATTORNEYS IN AMERICA.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.664
THE POLICIES VARY WIDELY.

32:12.730 --> 32:13.531
THE UPWARD TREND IN GUN VIOLENCE

32:13.598 --> 32:14.532
IS A NATIONAL TREND.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.933
THERE IS SOMETHING DEEPER THAN

32:16.000 --> 32:17.201
THE PARTICULAR POLICIES OF

32:17.268 --> 32:18.169
PROSECUTORS AND POLITICIANS.

32:18.236 --> 32:19.537
I MEAN, IT'S THE NATIONAL WAVE

32:19.604 --> 32:22.006
OF GUN VIOLENCE.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.207
>> Bill: BUT WE'D ALWAYS HAD A

32:23.274 --> 32:23.675
LOT OF A LOT OF GUNS.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.643
>> WE HAVE MORE THAN EVER

32:25.710 --> 32:25.943
BEFORE.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.812
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK THE

32:27.879 --> 32:28.179
LACK OF CRIME --

32:28.246 --> 32:29.614
>> I HAD THREE POLICE OFFICER

32:29.681 --> 32:31.215
SHOT IN MY DISTRICT IN THE LAST

32:31.282 --> 32:32.050
MONTH AND A HALF.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.585
THERE WAS AN 11-MONTH-OLD CHILD

32:34.652 --> 32:36.020
STRUCK BY A STRAY BULLET.

32:36.087 --> 32:36.587
THE GUN VIOLENCE IS OUT OF

32:36.654 --> 32:39.223
CONTROL IN MY CONSTITUENTS WANT

32:39.290 --> 32:40.792
TO LIVE IN AMERICA WHERE MOTHERS

32:40.858 --> 32:43.761
AND GRAND CHILDREN ARE NO LONGER

32:43.828 --> 32:44.529
BEARING CHILDREN AND

32:44.595 --> 32:44.862
GRANDCHILDREN.

32:44.929 --> 32:45.129
[APPLAUSE]

32:45.196 --> 32:48.666
>> YES, BUT DON'T YOU THINK

32:48.733 --> 32:51.703
THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING AT PLAY

32:51.769 --> 32:54.005
WHERE IN LOSS OF THESE CITIES

32:54.072 --> 32:55.440
THERE WAS EVERYONE, THE SHEIK

32:55.506 --> 32:56.341
THING TO SAY

32:56.407 --> 32:58.176
WAS TALKING ABOUT ABOLISHING THE

32:58.242 --> 32:59.143
POLICE AND DEFINING THE POLICE

32:59.210 --> 33:00.611
AND YOU KNOW WHAT A LOT OF

33:00.678 --> 33:01.512
POLICE OFFICERS

33:01.579 --> 33:02.447
I'VE SPOKEN TO IN MY REPORTING

33:02.513 --> 33:03.281
SYQUEST MAKE YOU WANT TO SEE

33:03.348 --> 33:05.683
WHAT THE CITIES ARE LIKE WITHOUT

33:05.750 --> 33:05.983
US?

33:06.050 --> 33:10.321
GREAT, WE ARE GOING TO WITHDRAW.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.857
I SPOKE WITH THE L.A.P.D.,

33:12.924 --> 33:14.058
SOMEONE CAME UP TO MY FRIEND

33:14.125 --> 33:14.926
TRIED TO STAB THEM IN DAYLIGHT

33:14.992 --> 33:16.894
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE L.A.P.D.

33:16.961 --> 33:17.762
SAID, WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO?

33:17.829 --> 33:20.565
ISN'T THAT A PART OF THIS?

33:20.631 --> 33:21.733
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT THE

33:21.799 --> 33:22.800
NUMBERS IN PERSPECTIVE.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.168
IN 1990 WHEN I WAS ONLY TWO

33:24.235 --> 33:25.737
THERE WERE MORE THAN 2200

33:25.803 --> 33:27.038
MURDERS IN NEW YORK CITY.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.674
IN 2021, THERE WERE 488.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.275
SO ARE WE REVERTING BACK TO A

33:31.342 --> 33:32.210
CRIME WAVE OF THE 1990s?

33:32.276 --> 33:36.447
NO, BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

33:36.514 --> 33:36.881
UPTICK IN VIOLENCE.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.950
>> Bill: SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE

33:39.016 --> 33:39.517
BLAMING THEM ON GUNS AND I'M

33:39.584 --> 33:40.885
SAYING THOSE GUNS WERE ALWAYS

33:40.952 --> 33:41.486
THERE, AMERICANS ALWAYS HAD A

33:41.552 --> 33:42.854
LOT OF GUNS.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.555
>> WE HAVE THE SAME VIOLENT

33:44.622 --> 33:46.391
GANGS WE HAD BEFORE BUT THE

33:46.457 --> 33:47.392
DIFFERENCES NOW THOSE GANGS HAVE

33:47.458 --> 33:48.459
ACCESS TO MORE GUNS.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.795
YOU CAN PURCHASE GUN COMPONENTS

33:50.862 --> 33:52.263
ONLINE AND ASSEMBLE A GUN AT

33:52.330 --> 33:53.231
HOME TO AN EXTENT THAT YOU NEVER

33:53.297 --> 33:55.299
COULD HAVE DONE BEFORE.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.368
>> Bill: OKAY.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.804
WELL, LET'S GO ON TO ANOTHER

33:59.871 --> 34:01.539
TOPIC.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.040
>> A MORE WHOLESOME TOPIC.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.208
>> Bill: THIS IS VERY

34:04.275 --> 34:04.475
WHOLESOME.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.345
I HAD A COUPLE OF GIGS CANCEL

34:07.412 --> 34:08.212
BECAUSE OF THE DREADED 19 THIS

34:08.279 --> 34:09.981
YEAR AND A PUT ME -- WHENEVER

34:10.047 --> 34:11.048
THAT HAPPENS, I WAS GOING TO BE

34:11.115 --> 34:12.350
IN NEW ORLEANS AT THE END OF THE

34:12.417 --> 34:14.652
MONTH AND IT'S NOT GOING TO

34:14.719 --> 34:15.520
HAPPEN NOW BECAUSE EVERYONE

34:15.586 --> 34:16.754
STOPPED BUYING TICKETS BECAUSE

34:16.821 --> 34:17.955
THEY WERE AFRAID.

34:18.022 --> 34:18.990
OKAY, WHENEVER THAT HAPPENS I

34:19.056 --> 34:20.591
GET INTO KIND OF A FUNK AND I

34:20.658 --> 34:22.126
WATCH A LOT OF STUPID

34:22.193 --> 34:23.761
TELEVISION.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.197
SO I WAS WATCHING THE LATEST

34:26.264 --> 34:27.832
DOCUMENTARY ON THE PLAYBOY

34:27.899 --> 34:29.600
MANSION, THERE HAVE BEEN LIKE A

34:29.667 --> 34:30.101
MILLION OF THEM.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.403
I THINK I AM IN 100 OF THEM.

34:32.470 --> 34:38.776
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:38.843 --> 34:40.745
>> Bill: BUT THIS ONE, THERE

34:40.812 --> 34:42.079
WAS SOMETHING AND I JUST HAD TO

34:42.146 --> 34:42.847
POINT OUT.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.782
IT SAID THAT THE DOGS AT THE

34:44.849 --> 34:45.416
PLAYBOY MANSION AT SOME POINT

34:45.483 --> 34:47.318
WERE HOOKED ON COCAINE.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.021
I SWEAR TO GOD, EVEN THE DOGS AT

34:50.087 --> 34:51.656
THE PLAYBOY MANSION WERE

34:51.722 --> 34:52.089
ADDICTED TO COCAINE.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.357
THIS IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT

34:53.424 --> 34:56.327
ISSUE, BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW

34:56.394 --> 34:57.061
WHAT, LET'S JUST GET ONE IN THE

34:57.128 --> 34:59.964
WIN COLUMN.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.032
LET'S JUST DO SOMETHING, I'M

35:01.098 --> 35:02.934
GOING TO BECOME A SINGLE ISSUE

35:03.000 --> 35:05.269
CANDIDATE OF GETTING DOGS OFF

35:05.336 --> 35:06.504
COCAINE.

35:06.571 --> 35:06.804
[APPLAUSE]

35:06.871 --> 35:08.539
SO I HAVE COME UP WITH THIS

35:08.606 --> 35:09.907
PAMPHLET.

35:09.974 --> 35:10.875
"HOW TO TELL IF YOUR DOG IS

35:10.942 --> 35:12.009
ADDICTED TO COCAINE."

35:12.076 --> 35:15.847
CAMPAIGN.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.482
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR SOME OF

35:17.548 --> 35:19.350
THE THINGS IN HERE?

35:19.417 --> 35:24.322
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE HEARS THE

35:24.388 --> 35:26.924
THEME TO "MIAMI VICE" HE HIDES

35:26.991 --> 35:27.291
UNDER THE SOFA.

35:27.358 --> 35:28.226
[LAUGHS]

35:28.292 --> 35:28.826
WHEN YOU TELL HIM "SPEAK!"

35:28.893 --> 35:31.095
HE WON'T SHUT UP.

35:31.162 --> 35:32.129
[LAUGHTER]

35:32.196 --> 35:32.797
HE STAYS UP ALL NIGHT CLEANING

35:32.864 --> 35:36.033
HIS DOGHOUSE.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.702
[LAUGHTER]

35:37.768 --> 35:46.177
[APPLAUSE]

35:46.244 --> 35:47.111
>> Bill: HE KEEPS LEAVING IN

35:47.178 --> 35:48.546
THE MIDDLE OF DINNER TO USE THE

35:48.613 --> 35:50.147
HYDRANT.

35:50.214 --> 35:50.915
YOU SEE HIM SUCKING SOME OTHER

35:50.982 --> 35:55.019
DOG'S DICK.

35:55.086 --> 35:55.920
[LAUGHTER]

35:55.987 --> 35:56.687
WHEN YOU TELL HIM TO GET DOWN,

35:56.754 --> 36:00.558
HE PUTS ON KOOL AND THE GANG.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.792
[LAUGHTER]

36:01.859 --> 36:02.827
WHEN HE HUMPS YOUR LEG, IT TAKES

36:02.894 --> 36:05.296
HIM FOREVER TO FINISH.

36:05.363 --> 36:12.003
[LAUGHTER]

36:12.069 --> 36:12.637
AND WHENEVER YOU CAN'T FIND HIM,

36:12.703 --> 36:14.539
HE'S WITH HUNTER BIDEN.

36:14.605 --> 36:22.213
[LAUGHTER]

36:22.280 --> 36:23.314
>> Bill: CONGRESSMAN, I

36:23.381 --> 36:26.417
COULDN'T HAVE YOU HERE WITHOUT

36:26.484 --> 36:27.018
TALKING ABOUT "WEST SIDE STORY."

36:27.084 --> 36:30.354
[LAUGHTER]

36:30.421 --> 36:33.624
>> CLEARLY A FINANCIAL EXPERT ON

36:33.691 --> 36:35.159
"WEST SIDE STORY."

36:35.226 --> 36:35.426
I'M GAY.

36:35.493 --> 36:38.896
>> Bill: NO, WHAT PART

36:38.963 --> 36:39.564
PUERTO RICAN.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.197
>> I'M PUERTO RICAN.

36:40.264 --> 36:40.898
>> Bill: RIGHTS, AND HER

36:40.965 --> 36:41.465
FATHER WAS FROM PUERTO RICO.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.769
THIS IS HALF OF WHAT THE SHOW IS

36:44.835 --> 36:45.803
ABOUT.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.905
IT'S A BIG STORY BECAUSE

36:47.972 --> 36:49.507
STEVEN SPIELBERG, PROBABLY THE

36:49.574 --> 36:50.274
MOST SUCCESSFUL DIRECTOR IN

36:50.341 --> 36:53.377
AMERICAN HISTORY, HE MADE THE

36:53.444 --> 36:54.779
REMAKE RECENTLY, AND OF COURSE

36:54.845 --> 36:56.347
HE TRIED TO BE VERY WOKE UP

36:56.414 --> 36:57.281
ABOUT IT AND GOT NOTHING BUT

36:57.348 --> 36:59.183
GRIEF.

36:59.250 --> 37:03.788
HE CAST -- IT'S TRUE.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.157
[LAUGHTER]

37:06.223 --> 37:08.559
RACHEL ZIGLER AS MARIA.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.428
SHE'S HALF COLOMBIAN -- I MEAN,

37:10.494 --> 37:12.296
SHE'S COLOMBIAN AND POLISH, I

37:12.363 --> 37:13.130
THINK.

37:13.197 --> 37:13.898
SO SHE'S NOT PUERTO RICAN.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.600
THAT IS I GUESS WHAT THE

37:15.666 --> 37:15.967
COMPLAINT WAS.

37:16.033 --> 37:18.836
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE

37:18.903 --> 37:20.605
A PROBLEM OF THIS?

37:20.671 --> 37:23.341
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT

37:23.407 --> 37:23.874
HANGS AROUND THE NECKS OF

37:23.941 --> 37:26.544
PROGRESSIVES ALL THE TIME AND

37:26.611 --> 37:29.580
PEOPLE, VOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY

37:29.647 --> 37:31.549
SAY, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

37:31.616 --> 37:32.383
WHY?

37:32.450 --> 37:32.883
WHAT IS THE POINT?

37:32.950 --> 37:36.787
YOU ARE TOO WOKE.

37:36.854 --> 37:37.688
>> [LAUGHS]

37:37.755 --> 37:40.257
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEFENDER

37:40.324 --> 37:42.293
OF WOKENESS?

37:42.360 --> 37:43.327
>> Bill: I'M JUST ASKING.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.730
>> HE'S ASKING ABOUT YOUR

37:45.796 --> 37:46.230
PUERTO RICAN IDENTITY --

37:46.297 --> 37:47.565
>> Bill: DOES MARIA IN

37:47.632 --> 37:48.566
"WEST SIDE STORY" HAVE TO BE

37:48.633 --> 37:51.135
PUERTO RICAN OR CAN SHE JUST BE

37:51.202 --> 37:52.370
COLOMBIAN?

37:52.436 --> 37:54.739
>> LOOK, WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF

37:54.805 --> 37:57.375
DIVERSITY, BUT ALSO I DO CARE

37:57.441 --> 37:58.576
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE END

37:58.643 --> 37:59.777
PRODUCT AND I'M SURE I'M GOING

37:59.844 --> 38:03.614
TO ENJOY -- I HAVE NOT SEEN THE

38:03.681 --> 38:04.281
SHOW, "WEST SIDE STORY."

38:04.348 --> 38:04.649
>> Bill: MOVIE.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.784
>> THE MOVIE, I'M SORRY.

38:06.851 --> 38:07.885
THAT GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH

38:07.952 --> 38:09.854
OF AN EXPERT I AM ON

38:09.920 --> 38:10.254
"WEST SIDE STORY."

38:10.321 --> 38:10.855
>> Bill: YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

38:10.921 --> 38:11.989
HE MADE THIS?

38:12.056 --> 38:14.525
COME ON.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.661
>> I AM SO KNEE-DEEP IN

38:16.727 --> 38:17.028
WASHINGTON, D.C.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.429
>> Bill: THERE WAS A MAN WHO

38:18.496 --> 38:19.697
WAS WORKING FOR YOU.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.099
>> CANCELLATION AT THIS POINT IS

38:22.166 --> 38:22.566
LIKE COVID.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.202
EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET IT, BUT

38:25.269 --> 38:26.937
IT'S -- ANYONE WHO TRIES TO MAKE

38:27.004 --> 38:28.939
ANYTHING OR TAKE A RISK OR DO

38:29.006 --> 38:29.373
ANYTHING CREATIVE.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.376
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD NOW

38:32.443 --> 38:33.210
WHERE FREDERICK DOUGLASS HAS

38:33.277 --> 38:34.178
BEEN CANCELED AND

38:34.245 --> 38:34.679
ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAS BEEN

38:34.745 --> 38:37.481
CANCELED, SO WHY NOT JOIN THE

38:37.548 --> 38:37.948
RANKS OF THE CANCELED?

38:38.015 --> 38:40.484
IT'S PRETTY GREAT TO BE FREE OF

38:40.551 --> 38:42.887
THE BULLSHIT.

38:42.953 --> 38:45.890
[APPLAUSE]

38:45.956 --> 38:50.995
>> I GUESS, I SHARE THE CONCERNS

38:51.062 --> 38:51.462
ABOUT CANCEL CULTURE.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.731
MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE

38:53.798 --> 38:54.899
CONVERSATION ABOUT

38:54.965 --> 38:56.967
CANCEL CULTURE IS THAT WE OFTEN

38:57.034 --> 39:00.171
SPEAK OF IT AS THOUGH IT WERE AN

39:00.237 --> 39:00.638
EXCLUSIVELY LEFT-WING

39:00.705 --> 39:00.938
PHENOMENON.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.873
>> Bill: NOT ME.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.375
>> I WOULD ARGUE THE MOST

39:04.442 --> 39:07.311
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF

39:07.378 --> 39:08.345
CANCEL CULTURE IN AMERICA IS

39:08.412 --> 39:11.348
DONALD TRUMP'S IRON GRIP ON THE

39:11.415 --> 39:12.650
PSYCHE OF REPUBLICANS.

39:12.717 --> 39:13.084
>> Bill: ABSOLUTELY.

39:13.150 --> 39:13.851
>> THERE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO

39:13.918 --> 39:14.852
LIVE IN FEAR OF CANCELLATION AT

39:14.919 --> 39:17.755
THE HANDS OF DONALD TRUMP.

39:17.822 --> 39:21.092
THEY'RE AFRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH

39:21.158 --> 39:22.293
ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTION WHO

39:22.359 --> 39:24.161
VOTED TO DECERTIFY THE ELECTION

39:24.228 --> 39:25.362
EVEN AFTER A VIOLENT ASSAULT ON

39:25.429 --> 39:26.363
THE U.S. CAPITOL.

39:26.430 --> 39:27.665
THAT KIND OF CANCEL CULTURE IS

39:27.732 --> 39:30.501
FAR MORE ALARMING TO ME IN THE

39:30.568 --> 39:30.835
EXCESSES OF --

39:30.901 --> 39:32.036
>> Bill: NO ONE EVER GOT

39:32.103 --> 39:32.303
CANCEL --

39:32.369 --> 39:34.505
[APPLAUSE]

39:34.572 --> 39:37.908
NO ONE EVER GOT CANCELED FASTER

39:37.975 --> 39:41.746
OR HARDER THAN COLIN KAEPERNICK.

39:41.812 --> 39:42.279
>> YEAH.

39:42.346 --> 39:44.248
>> Bill: THAT WAS A RIGHT WING

39:44.315 --> 39:45.382
CANCELLATION, YOU ARE RIGHT.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.585
THERE ARE SNOWFLAKES ON BOTH

39:47.651 --> 39:53.591
SIDES.

39:53.657 --> 39:54.225
BUT IF I CAN BRING UP ONE MORE

39:54.291 --> 39:54.825
THING WITH THE WOKENESS, THIS

39:54.892 --> 39:55.159
WEEK IN WOKE.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.394
>> THAT SHOULD BE A STANDING

39:57.461 --> 39:57.628
SEGMENT.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.263
>> Bill: THIS IS PRETTY

39:59.330 --> 40:00.397
AMAZING, THE ACADEMY MUSEUM OF

40:00.464 --> 40:01.766
MOTION PICTURES, I DIDN'T KNOW

40:01.832 --> 40:03.567
THERE WAS SUCH A THING, IT IS

40:03.634 --> 40:04.168
APPARENTLY A MUSEUM, THAT IS

40:04.235 --> 40:06.971
WHAT I GOT OUT OF THIS, THE

40:07.037 --> 40:08.506
ACADEMY MUSEUM, MAYBE THIS IS A

40:08.572 --> 40:11.442
MAN ACADEMY, I'M SURE WE HAD A

40:11.509 --> 40:12.409
MUSEUM FOR MOTION PICTURES BUT

40:12.476 --> 40:13.978
APPARENTLY THEY PUT THE ARM ON

40:14.044 --> 40:15.980
THE A-LISTERS OUT HERE TO GO.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.916
>> WERE YOU INVITED?

40:18.983 --> 40:19.483
>> Bill: NO.

40:19.550 --> 40:19.884
ARE YOU KIDDING?

40:19.950 --> 40:20.151
[LAUGHTER]

40:20.217 --> 40:21.652
I AM NOT PART OF THAT THING.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.722
AND I AM SO GLAD BECAUSE I

40:24.789 --> 40:25.856
WOULDN'T WANT TO GO.

40:25.923 --> 40:26.991
BUT BRAD PITT SHOWED UP IN

40:27.057 --> 40:29.527
QUEEN LATIFAH SHOWED UP AND

40:29.593 --> 40:30.427
NICOLE KIDMAN SHOWED UP AND

40:30.494 --> 40:31.629
LADY GAGA WAS THERE AND I KNOW

40:31.695 --> 40:32.463
THESE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

40:32.530 --> 40:34.431
THE HOUSE TO GO TO THIS SHIT,

40:34.498 --> 40:35.699
BUT SOMEBODY SAID THIS IS

40:35.766 --> 40:37.768
IMPORTANT, THIS IS WHAT WE DO,

40:37.835 --> 40:40.371
THIS IS OUR BUSINESS, SHOW UP.

40:40.437 --> 40:41.238
OKAY, THIS IS THE ACADEMY MUSEUM

40:41.305 --> 40:42.907
OF MOTION PICTURES.

40:42.973 --> 40:47.378
THEY LEFT OUT THE JEWS.

40:47.444 --> 40:48.779
>> YES, THEY DID.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.047
>> Bill: THAT IS PRETTY

40:50.114 --> 40:51.382
AMAZING, THAT IS LIKE THE

40:51.448 --> 40:55.920
HOLOCAUST MUSEUM NOT MENTIONING

40:55.986 --> 40:56.787
THE NAZIS.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.522
I'M JUST SAYING NAZIS WERE

40:58.589 --> 40:59.757
INTEGRAL TO THE HOLOCAUST.

40:59.824 --> 41:00.791
STUDIO FOUNDERS, MAKE THE LIST,

41:00.858 --> 41:06.964
CARL LEMLEY, GERMAN BORN JEW

41:07.031 --> 41:09.466
STARTED UNIVERSAL PICTURES, FOX,

41:09.533 --> 41:12.236
HUNGARIAN BORN JEW, THAT WAS FO

41:12.303 --> 41:12.736
FOX.

41:12.803 --> 41:16.974
COHEN, AMERICAN-BORN JEW, ADOLPH

41:17.041 --> 41:18.742
ZUCKER, HUNGARIAN BORN JEW, THAT

41:18.809 --> 41:21.545
WAS PARAMOUNT PICTURES.

41:21.612 --> 41:22.913
POLISH BORN JEW, MARK IS LOW, WE

41:22.980 --> 41:25.015
STILL HAVE THE THEATERS AND

41:25.082 --> 41:26.617
LOUIS B MAYER, THAT WAS MGM.

41:26.684 --> 41:29.753
THE JEWS INVENTED THIS BUSINESS.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.891
[APPLAUSE]

41:33.958 --> 41:35.593
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A TOPIC

41:35.659 --> 41:37.761
YOU WOULD WANT --

41:37.828 --> 41:39.730
>> HE GETS THE PUERTO RICAN

41:39.797 --> 41:41.932
"WEST SIDE STORY" QUESTION, I

41:41.999 --> 41:43.133
GET THE JEWISH QUESTION.

41:43.200 --> 41:43.534
>> Bill: EXACTLY.

41:43.601 --> 41:45.803
>> BUT I KNOW WE BOTH BELIEVE WE

41:45.870 --> 41:47.338
CAN ANSWER BOTH.

41:47.404 --> 41:48.472
>> NEXT QUESTION.

41:48.539 --> 41:48.806
>> EXACTLY.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.441
THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF A NEW

41:50.507 --> 41:53.377
IDEOLOGY THAT CLAIMS TO BE ALL

41:53.444 --> 41:56.113
ABOUT DIVERSITY, BUT FOR SOME

41:56.180 --> 41:58.883
REASON, THE JEWS AND JEWISH

41:58.949 --> 42:00.251
HISTORY DON'T SEEM TO RANK OR

42:00.317 --> 42:00.718
DON'T SEEM TO COUNT.

42:00.784 --> 42:04.521
IT'S AN IDEOLOGY THAT HAS

42:04.588 --> 42:05.556
WHITEWASHED, FRANKLY, JEWISH

42:05.623 --> 42:06.991
HISTORY THAT SAYS THAT BECAUSE

42:07.057 --> 42:12.596
AMERICANS JEWS ARE SUCCESSFUL,

42:12.663 --> 42:15.299
BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT FROM WHITE

42:15.366 --> 42:18.402
PRIVILEGE, BECAUSE THEY CAN

42:18.469 --> 42:20.437
CHANGE THEIR LAST NAME TO

42:20.504 --> 42:21.338
LAUREN, BECAUSE OF THE VICTIM

42:21.405 --> 42:23.741
THEY CLAIM, SINCE BECAUSE THE

42:23.807 --> 42:26.911
1990s THE JEWS ARE THE SINGLE

42:26.977 --> 42:28.545
MOST AGGRIEVED GROUP WHEN IT

42:28.612 --> 42:29.713
COMES TO RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED

42:29.780 --> 42:30.547
HATE CRIMES, INCLUDING WHAT

42:30.614 --> 42:34.418
HAPPENED IN TEXAS LAST SATURDAY

42:34.485 --> 42:35.019
WITH THE HOSTAGETAKING AT THE

42:35.085 --> 42:36.887
SYNAGOGUE, WHICH THANK GOD NO

42:36.954 --> 42:37.254
ONE WAS KILLED.

42:37.321 --> 42:40.758
IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU'RE

42:40.824 --> 42:41.759
LOOKING AT IDENTITY GROUPS

42:41.825 --> 42:43.327
MERELY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE

42:43.394 --> 42:44.728
AMOUNT OF MELANIN IN YOUR SKIN,

42:44.795 --> 42:45.362
MERELY THROUGH THE LENS OF RACE

42:45.429 --> 42:48.565
YOU ARE GOING TO OVERLOOK THIS

42:48.632 --> 42:50.701
UNIQUE STORY OF THE JEWS, THE

42:50.768 --> 42:53.203
UNIQUE OPPRESSION THAT JEWS HAVE

42:53.270 --> 42:55.172
FACED AND THEIR SUCCESSES COME

42:55.239 --> 42:56.273
AS YOU WERE JUST MENTIONING COME

42:56.340 --> 42:56.707
IN THIS CASE.

42:56.774 --> 42:59.043
>> Bill: SO WHY DID THEY LEAVE

42:59.109 --> 43:01.345
THEM OUT OF THE MOTION PICTURE

43:01.412 --> 43:01.578
MUSEUM?

43:01.645 --> 43:02.680
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION QUESTION

43:02.746 --> 43:05.983
JUST BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO --

43:06.050 --> 43:07.384
AND THEY DID INCLUDE LIKE

43:07.451 --> 43:09.520
OBVIOUSLY SPIKE LEE AND PEOPLE

43:09.586 --> 43:11.288
WHO DESERVE TO BE INCLUDED.

43:11.355 --> 43:13.691
THEY ARE FANTASTIC FILMMAKERS.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.093
BUT YOUR THEORY THEY LEFT THEM

43:16.160 --> 43:17.861
OUT OUT OF PREJUDICE BECAUSE

43:17.928 --> 43:18.696
THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL?

43:18.762 --> 43:20.331
>> I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE

43:20.397 --> 43:21.465
HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.033
>> Bill: THERE IS NO HISTORY,

43:23.100 --> 43:24.668
JUST OPENED.

43:24.735 --> 43:25.569
[LAUGHTER]

43:25.636 --> 43:27.204
THE HISTORY IS THEY FUCKED UP ON

43:27.271 --> 43:27.438
DAY ONE.

43:27.504 --> 43:29.773
>> RIGHT.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.742
I WOULD SAY GIVEN THAT THIS IS

43:31.809 --> 43:32.943
HOLLYWOOD AND GIVEN THE IDEOLOGY

43:33.010 --> 43:33.877
AND THE ORTHODOXY AND THE DOGMA

43:33.944 --> 43:36.613
THAT IS PREVALENT HERE AND

43:36.680 --> 43:36.814
THE --

43:36.880 --> 43:39.283
>> Bill: THIS TOWN IS RUN BY

43:39.350 --> 43:39.483
JEWS!

43:39.550 --> 43:41.552
[APPLAUSE]

43:41.618 --> 43:43.954
WHAT THE HECK COULD THEY BE

43:44.021 --> 43:44.288
THINKING?

43:44.355 --> 43:45.222
THEY STILL RUN IT!

43:45.289 --> 43:45.489
[LAUGHS]

43:45.556 --> 43:48.125
>> WHAT THEY MAY BE THINKING IS,

43:48.192 --> 43:49.393
THOSE ARE JUST DEAD WHITE GUYS.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.295
SORRY.

43:51.362 --> 43:54.098
>> Bill: IS AT THE FOUNDING

43:54.164 --> 43:54.732
FATHER EQUIVALENTS?

43:54.798 --> 43:55.132
>> SURE!

43:55.199 --> 43:56.633
>> Bill: LIKE TEARING DOWN THE

43:56.700 --> 43:57.034
LINCOLN STATUE?

43:57.101 --> 43:58.969
OH, MY GOD.

43:59.036 --> 44:04.675
>> I'M CURIOUS WHAT RITCHIE

44:04.742 --> 44:05.209
THINKS.

44:05.275 --> 44:06.710
>> I'M WORRIED ABOUT

44:06.777 --> 44:07.745
ANTI-SEMITISM IN OUR SOCIETY,

44:07.811 --> 44:08.512
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO

44:08.579 --> 44:11.982
EXCLUDE PRO-ISRAEL JEWS IN

44:12.049 --> 44:13.317
PARTICULAR FROM THE PROGRESSIVE

44:13.384 --> 44:13.717
MOVEMENT.

44:13.784 --> 44:16.120
I FEEL ALL OF US HAVE AN

44:16.186 --> 44:17.121
OBLIGATION TO CONDEMN THE

44:17.187 --> 44:17.755
ANTI-SEMITISM NO MATTER WHAT

44:17.821 --> 44:21.091
FORM IT TAKES AND NO MATTER WHAT

44:21.158 --> 44:21.859
IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION FROM WHICH

44:21.925 --> 44:22.526
IT COMES.

44:22.593 --> 44:25.262
[APPLAUSE]

44:25.329 --> 44:27.898
IT DOES FEEL LIKE OUR SOCIETY

44:27.965 --> 44:29.299
INCREASINGLY FAILS TO TREAT

44:29.366 --> 44:29.767
ANTI-SEMITISM WITH THE

44:29.833 --> 44:31.769
SERIOUSNESS THAT IT DESERVES.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.404
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU ONE

44:33.470 --> 44:34.738
FINAL QUESTION, THERE'S GOING TO

44:34.805 --> 44:36.140
BE HEARINGS WE ARE GOING TO SEE

44:36.206 --> 44:38.208
ON TV, MAYBE LIKE THE WATERGATE

44:38.275 --> 44:39.209
HEARINGS, BY JANUARY 6 THAT ARE

44:39.276 --> 44:39.777
GOING TO START.

44:39.843 --> 44:43.380
I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU KNOW WHEN?

44:43.447 --> 44:44.148
YOU WOULD KNOW THIS.

44:44.214 --> 44:45.282
>> IN THE WEEKS TO COME.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.285
>> Bill: IN THE WEEKS, OKAY.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.286
JAMIE RASKIN, HE IS A COLLEAGUE

44:49.353 --> 44:51.321
OF YOURS IN CONGRESS.

44:51.388 --> 44:52.556
HE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW

44:52.623 --> 44:54.892
THE ROOF OFF THE HOUSE IN TERMS

44:54.958 --> 44:56.460
OF EXPLAINING TO AMERICA WHAT

44:56.527 --> 44:57.828
ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE ATTACK

44:57.895 --> 44:58.762
ON OUR DEMOCRACY.

44:58.829 --> 44:59.396
I HOPE EVERYBODY WILL WATCH AND

44:59.463 --> 45:02.032
I HOPE EVERYONE WILL DISCUSS AND

45:02.099 --> 45:03.267
IT WILL LEAD TO A REPORT THAT I

45:03.333 --> 45:05.402
HOPE AGAIN WILL BE A

45:05.469 --> 45:05.903
GAME-CHANGER IN TERMS OF

45:05.969 --> 45:09.773
AMERICAN HISTORY.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.140
OVERSELLING IT?

45:10.207 --> 45:12.476
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN

45:12.543 --> 45:14.344
THIS MOVIE BEFORE, WHERE THE

45:14.411 --> 45:14.912
HALF OF AMERICA WHO ALREADY

45:14.978 --> 45:17.114
BELIEVES IT WATCHES IT AND LOVES

45:17.181 --> 45:19.283
IT AND THE HALF THAT DOESN'T, IT

45:19.349 --> 45:21.318
IGNORES IT AND IT DOESN'T

45:21.385 --> 45:21.552
MATTER.

45:21.618 --> 45:24.054
SEE IT DIFFERENTLY?

45:24.121 --> 45:25.289
>> I AGREE WITH JAMIE.

45:25.355 --> 45:28.325
AND I WAS SWORN IN ON

45:28.392 --> 45:29.093
JANUARY 3RD, 2021.

45:29.159 --> 45:31.195
AND THEN LIVED THROUGH THE

45:31.261 --> 45:31.795
INSURRECTION THREE DAYS LATER.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.697
>> Bill: WOW.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.667
>> SO IT HITS CLOSE TO HOME.

45:36.733 --> 45:38.869
MY COLLEAGUE JOKED, NONE OF THIS

45:38.936 --> 45:40.838
WAS HAPPENING UNTIL YOU CAME

45:40.904 --> 45:41.038
ALONG.

45:41.105 --> 45:41.305
[LAUGHTER]

45:41.371 --> 45:42.806
>> Bill: THAT'S GOOD.

45:42.873 --> 45:43.040
[LAUGHS]

45:43.107 --> 45:45.943
[APPLAUSE]

45:46.009 --> 45:48.812
>> FOR ME, WHAT IS AT STAKE IS

45:48.879 --> 45:50.180
THE SURVIVAL OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

45:50.247 --> 45:51.982
WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE TAKEN FOR

45:52.049 --> 45:52.216
GRANTED.

45:52.282 --> 45:54.885
AS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, WE

45:54.952 --> 45:57.721
CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS

45:57.788 --> 45:58.555
ABOUT TAXES AND SPENDING IN

45:58.622 --> 46:01.325
CULTURE AND SOCIETY BUT AS

46:01.391 --> 46:03.227
AMERICANS WE SHOULD BE UNITED

46:03.293 --> 46:05.395
AROUND THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF

46:05.462 --> 46:06.697
POWER.

46:06.763 --> 46:07.798
AS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR

46:07.865 --> 46:08.065
DEMOCRACY.

46:08.132 --> 46:08.332
[APPLAUSE]

46:08.398 --> 46:11.368
WE SHOULD BE UNITED IN DEFENDING

46:11.435 --> 46:12.536
THE IDEA THAT POLITICAL

46:12.603 --> 46:13.170
DIFFERENCES SHOULD BE RESOLVED

46:13.237 --> 46:15.906
NOT BY VIOLENCE, BUT BY

46:15.973 --> 46:16.707
ELECTIONS, BY RESPECTING THE

46:16.773 --> 46:19.076
RESULTS OF ELECTIONS.

46:19.143 --> 46:19.576
[APPLAUSE]

46:19.643 --> 46:21.512
>> Bill: WE WILL END IT THERE,

46:21.578 --> 46:23.013
HEAR HEAR HEAR.

46:23.080 --> 46:23.981
THANK YOU, NOW IT'S TIME FOR US

46:24.047 --> 46:29.887
TO BE 20 NEW RULES IN 2022, OUR

46:29.953 --> 46:30.287
20TH YEAR.

46:30.354 --> 46:33.056
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

46:33.123 --> 46:35.259
NOW THAT LOUISIANA SENATE

46:35.325 --> 46:35.792
CANDIDATE GARY CHAMBERS IS

46:35.859 --> 46:39.396
SMOKING POT IN HIS NEW CAMPAIGN

46:39.463 --> 46:40.931
AD, HE HAS TO TELL ME WHERE I

46:40.998 --> 46:43.634
CAN DONATE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.469
[LAUGHTER]

46:45.536 --> 46:47.971
BECAUSE I'M EXCITED FOR THE DAY

46:48.038 --> 46:50.340
WHEN DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN REDUCED

46:50.407 --> 46:51.475
TO, DO YOU LIKE THE CANDIDATES

46:51.542 --> 46:53.977
WHO HOLD UP GUNS IN THEIR ADS?

46:54.044 --> 46:54.811
OR DO YOU LIKE CANDIDATES WHO

46:54.878 --> 46:57.114
HOLD UP WEED?

46:57.181 --> 47:02.119
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

47:02.186 --> 47:03.754
THAT WAY WE CAN FINALLY UNITE

47:03.820 --> 47:05.656
AROUND THE ONE FEELING BOTH

47:05.722 --> 47:07.124
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SHARE:

47:07.191 --> 47:09.593
PARANOIA.

47:09.660 --> 47:18.001
[LAUGHTER]

47:18.068 --> 47:19.403
STEPHANIE MATTO, THE FORMER

47:19.469 --> 47:20.571
REALITY STAR WHO NOW HAS A

47:20.637 --> 47:25.042
TIKTOK CHANNEL WHERE SHE CHARGES

47:25.108 --> 47:25.776
$1,000 FOR A JAR OF FARTS, CAN'T

47:25.842 --> 47:27.377
STOP THERE.

47:27.444 --> 47:28.679
THERE'S STILL ONE TINY PART OF

47:28.745 --> 47:29.246
MY INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVEN'T

47:29.313 --> 47:31.815
INSULTED.

47:31.882 --> 47:32.683
I SAY SHE HAS TO SELL AN NFT OF

47:32.749 --> 47:36.186
A JAR OF FARTS.

47:36.253 --> 47:42.626
[LAUGHTER]

47:42.693 --> 47:45.963
OH WAIT, SHE DOES?

47:46.029 --> 47:46.697
THANK YOU, WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

47:46.763 --> 47:52.436
I THINK WE'RE DONE.

47:52.502 --> 47:55.872
[LAUGHTER]

47:55.939 --> 47:57.241
NEW RULE: NOW THAT ANTONIO BROWN

47:57.307 --> 47:59.610
HAS QUIT THE TAMPA BAY

47:59.676 --> 48:00.644
BUCCANEERS BY STRIPPING TO THE

48:00.711 --> 48:03.046
WAIST, FLASHING A PEACE SIGN AND

48:03.113 --> 48:07.751
JOGGING OFF, EVERYONE HAS TO

48:07.818 --> 48:10.587
QUIT THEIR JOB THAT WAY!

48:10.654 --> 48:11.955
[APPLAUSE]

48:12.022 --> 48:12.990
NO, IT'S NOT PROFESSIONAL, AND

48:13.056 --> 48:14.424
IT MAY AFFECT FUTURE EMPLOYMENT

48:14.491 --> 48:15.726
PROSPECTS, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

48:15.792 --> 48:16.827
WHEN MIRIAM FROM ACCOUNTING DOES

48:16.893 --> 48:19.830
IT, YOU'LL NEVER FORGET HER.

48:19.896 --> 48:26.670
[LAUGHTER]

48:26.737 --> 48:28.338
NEW RULE: IF CABLE NEWS REALLY

48:28.405 --> 48:29.473
WANTS ME TO CARE ABOUT UKRAINE

48:29.539 --> 48:31.141
AND RUSSIA, THEY HAVE TO FIND

48:31.208 --> 48:32.709
SOME BETTER B-ROLL THAN THIS

48:32.776 --> 48:33.343
POOR BASTARD IN A TRENCH IN THE

48:33.410 --> 48:36.046
SNOW.

48:36.113 --> 48:37.447
[LAUGHTER]

48:37.514 --> 48:38.649
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ME WANT TO

48:38.715 --> 48:39.283
SEND THEM OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST

48:39.349 --> 48:40.183
TO FIGHT AND DIE.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.251
IT MAKES ME WANT TO SEND

48:41.318 --> 48:46.490
KYLE RITTENHOUSE.

48:46.556 --> 48:54.598
[LAUGHTER]

48:54.665 --> 48:57.034
NEW RULE: PABST BLUE RIBBON,

48:57.100 --> 48:59.236
WHOSE ACCOUNT TWEETED, "NOT

48:59.303 --> 48:59.903
DRINKING THIS JANUARY?

48:59.970 --> 49:03.507
TRY EATING ASS!"

49:03.573 --> 49:04.908
[LAUGHTER]

49:04.975 --> 49:06.109
HAS TO TELL ME: A, ARE THESE MY

49:06.176 --> 49:08.178
ONLY TWO CHOICES?

49:08.245 --> 49:09.579
AND B, DID THIS MESSAGE REALLY

49:09.646 --> 49:14.785
COME FROM AN OFFICIAL SOURCE IN

49:14.851 --> 49:17.220
THE COMPANY?

49:17.287 --> 49:17.888
OR WAS SOMEONE JUST BEING TONGUE

49:17.954 --> 49:22.893
IN CHEEK?

49:22.959 --> 49:23.160
[LAUGHTER]

49:23.226 --> 49:25.195
[APPLAUSE]

49:25.262 --> 49:27.331
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE: DEMOCRATS

49:27.397 --> 49:28.965
MUST THANK PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR

49:29.032 --> 49:30.767
HIS GREAT SERVICE TO AMERICA,

49:30.834 --> 49:35.405
AND THEN MOVE HIM INTO A MORE

49:35.472 --> 49:37.741
CEREMONIAL ROLE.

49:37.808 --> 49:38.975
LET ME FINISH.

49:39.042 --> 49:39.609
JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN PRESIDENT NOW

49:39.676 --> 49:40.777
FOR A YEAR AND A DAY.

49:40.844 --> 49:41.411
THE DAY WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE

49:41.478 --> 49:44.281
YEAR?

49:44.348 --> 49:45.248
[LAUGHTER]

49:45.315 --> 49:47.117
NOT HORRIBLE, CERTAINLY BETTER

49:47.184 --> 49:48.318
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT FOR

49:48.385 --> 49:49.019
SOME REASON AMERICA HAS LOST ITS

49:49.086 --> 49:51.488
FAITH IN JOE.

49:51.555 --> 49:53.357
SOMETIMES THAT JUST HAPPENS.

49:53.423 --> 49:55.225
A NEW CBS POLL HAS JUST OVER A

49:55.292 --> 49:56.193
QUARTER OF AMERICANS SAYING THE

49:56.259 --> 49:57.494
COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE RIGHT

49:57.561 --> 49:59.496
DIRECTION, AND THE QUINNIPIAC

49:59.563 --> 50:02.165
POLL HAS BIDEN'S YEAR ONE

50:02.232 --> 50:03.233
APPROVAL RATING AT 33%, THE

50:03.300 --> 50:03.967
LOWEST FOR ANY PRESIDENT EVER,

50:04.034 --> 50:05.502
EVEN TRUMP.

50:05.569 --> 50:07.137
33%.

50:07.204 --> 50:08.672
IF HE WERE A MOVIE HE'D BE

50:08.739 --> 50:11.441
LISTED AS "CERTIFIED ROTTEN."

50:11.508 --> 50:18.615
[LAUGHTER]

50:18.682 --> 50:19.649
OF COURSE HE'S NOT, AND WHAT'S

50:19.716 --> 50:21.385
GONE WRONG IS CERTAINLY NOT ALL

50:21.451 --> 50:22.886
JOE'S FAULT, BUT THE HARD FACT

50:22.953 --> 50:24.421
IS, EVEN WHEN JOE DOES SOMETHING

50:24.488 --> 50:27.057
GOOD, HE SEEMS TO GET NO CREDIT.

50:27.124 --> 50:28.825
OUR ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

50:28.892 --> 50:29.726
AWESOME CONSIDERING WHAT WE'VE

50:29.793 --> 50:31.561
JUST BEEN THROUGH.

50:31.628 --> 50:33.330
WAGES ARE UP, WORKERS HAVE MORE

50:33.397 --> 50:39.202
LEVERAGE, WE AVOIDED A

50:39.269 --> 50:39.503
RECESSION --

50:39.569 --> 50:41.405
[APPLAUSE]

50:41.471 --> 50:42.839
STOCKS JUST HAD THEIR BEST YEAR

50:42.906 --> 50:46.376
SINCE 1995.

50:46.443 --> 50:47.411
AND YET ONLY 38% APPROVE OF HIS

50:47.477 --> 50:49.579
HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY.

50:49.646 --> 50:50.881
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

50:50.947 --> 50:53.116
LACK PASSIONATE DEFENDERS.

50:53.183 --> 50:57.788
AS OPPOSED TO TRUMP, WHO EVERY

50:57.854 --> 50:59.723
DAY SHIT THE BED, AND 90% OF

50:59.790 --> 51:03.627
REPUBLICANS BLAMED THE BED.

51:03.693 --> 51:06.396
[APPLAUSE]

51:06.463 --> 51:08.165
AND BIDEN MAY WELL HAVE EVEN

51:08.231 --> 51:12.035
FURTHER TO FALL, BECAUSE THERE'S

51:12.102 --> 51:13.703
NO DIE-HARD BIDEN BASE.

51:13.770 --> 51:14.538
HIS IS A COALITION OF THE

51:14.604 --> 51:15.705
UNENTHUSED.

51:15.772 --> 51:17.207
NO ONE EVER FAINTED DURING ONE

51:17.274 --> 51:19.543
OF HIS SPEECHES, OR CLAIMED

51:19.609 --> 51:21.044
BIDEN WAS APPOINTED BY GOD, OR

51:21.111 --> 51:24.748
ASKED HIM TO SIGN THEIR TITS.

51:24.815 --> 51:26.450
[LAUGHTER]

51:26.516 --> 51:27.451
WHEN HE FIRST GOT INTO OFFICE I

51:27.517 --> 51:29.586
TOLD YOU THAT BIDEN WAS LIKE

51:29.653 --> 51:30.687
NON-DAIRY CREAMER: NOBODY'S

51:30.754 --> 51:31.655
FIRST CHOICE, BUT HE GOT THE JOB

51:31.721 --> 51:34.991
DONE.

51:35.058 --> 51:40.230
[LAUGHTER]

51:40.297 --> 51:41.631
AND HE DID GET THE JOB DONE, IN

51:41.698 --> 51:43.500
2020, WHEN HIS NATION NEEDED HIM

51:43.567 --> 51:46.970
TO BEAT TRUMP, AND HE DID.

51:47.037 --> 51:51.975
[APPLAUSE]

51:52.042 --> 51:55.579
BUT FAIR OR NOT, TO MOST PEOPLE

51:55.645 --> 51:56.713
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE JOE BIDEN'S

51:56.780 --> 51:59.583
GET-UP-AND-GO GOT UP AND WENT.

51:59.649 --> 52:00.917
THERE'S NO BIG DICK ENERGY

52:00.984 --> 52:01.618
COMING OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC

52:01.685 --> 52:03.854
PARTY.

52:03.920 --> 52:09.359
[LAUGHTER]

52:09.426 --> 52:12.696
[APPLAUSE]

52:12.762 --> 52:14.431
>> Bill: AND THEIR BENCH IS SO

52:14.498 --> 52:16.066
THIN THEY'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT

52:16.132 --> 52:18.768
RUNNING HILLARY AGAIN.

52:18.835 --> 52:19.970
AND I'M SURE SHE'S THINKING,

52:20.036 --> 52:22.372
"WELL, WHO ELSE YOU GOT?"

52:22.439 --> 52:23.807
KAMALA?

52:23.874 --> 52:24.374
HER APPROVAL RATING IS LOWER

52:24.441 --> 52:30.347
THAN BIDEN'S.

52:30.413 --> 52:31.014
BERNIE'S TOO OLD, AND PETE'S TOO

52:31.081 --> 52:32.949
YOUNG.

52:33.016 --> 52:35.785
AND THIS DIDN'T WORK OUT.

52:35.852 --> 52:38.755
[LAUGHTER]

52:38.822 --> 52:42.325
BUT THERE IS ONE GUY ALL

52:42.392 --> 52:43.727
DEMOCRATS COULD RALLY BEHIND AND

52:43.793 --> 52:44.528
WOULD LOVE TO SEE BACK IN THE

52:44.594 --> 52:48.965
WHITE HOUSE.

52:49.032 --> 52:53.937
[APPLAUSE]

52:54.004 --> 52:55.338
NOW, OF COURSE, YOU'RE SAYING,

52:55.405 --> 52:57.207
"BUT OBAMA CAN'T BE PRESIDENT

52:57.274 --> 52:57.874
AGAIN, HE'S HAD TWO TERMS, AND

52:57.941 --> 53:01.845
THAT'S THE RULE."

53:01.912 --> 53:04.414
YEAH, THE RULE.

53:04.481 --> 53:05.348
YOU KNOW, POLITICS, OFTEN CALLED

53:05.415 --> 53:07.150
"THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE,"

53:07.217 --> 53:07.951
REALLY HAS NOW BECOME "THE ART

53:08.018 --> 53:08.818
OF WHATEVER YOU CAN GET AWAY

53:08.885 --> 53:11.555
WITH."

53:11.621 --> 53:12.188
SOMETHING ONLY REPUBLICANS SEEM

53:12.255 --> 53:14.958
TO REALIZE.

53:15.025 --> 53:15.959
LIKE WHEN THEY JUST MADE UP THAT

53:16.026 --> 53:17.160
PRESIDENTS CAN'T APPOINT A

53:17.227 --> 53:17.894
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN AN

53:17.961 --> 53:20.063
ELECTION YEAR.

53:20.130 --> 53:21.298
OR WHEN THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS

53:21.364 --> 53:22.766
AND SAID, "OH, WAIT, THEY CAN

53:22.832 --> 53:26.836
WHEN OUR SIDE IS IN POWER."

53:26.903 --> 53:30.707
HERE'S MITCH McCONNELL TELLING

53:30.774 --> 53:32.409
US IN 2016 THAT HE'S NOT GONNA

53:32.475 --> 53:33.310
EVEN GIVE OBAMA'S SUPREME COURT

53:33.376 --> 53:34.010
PICK A HEARING BECAUSE THERE'S

53:34.077 --> 53:34.578
ONLY EIGHT MONTHS TO THE

53:34.644 --> 53:38.481
ELECTION.

53:44.521 --> 53:46.323
NOT THIS LAME DUCK PRESIDENT ON

54:06.376 --> 54:08.478
IT'S A FEATURE.

54:08.545 --> 54:09.579

YOU WANT ME TO CONCEDE WHEN I

54:28.898 --> 54:29.733

54:29.799 --> 54:31.201
THAT'S JUST A TRADITION.

54:31.267 --> 54:33.737
HERE AT "REAL TIME," AS A WAY TO

54:33.803 --> 54:35.305
DESCRIBE THIS PHENOMENON WE LIKE

FOOTBALL TEAM TO KICK FIELD

54:43.580 --> 54:44.881

54:44.948 --> 54:49.753
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING

54:49.819 --> 54:51.588
SPECIFICALLY IN THE RULE BOOK

54:51.655 --> 54:52.722
THAT SAID A TEAM COULDN'T SIGN

54:52.789 --> 54:55.992
AND PLAY A MULE.

54:56.059 --> 54:56.893
TRUMP PULLED A GUS EVERY DAY

54:56.960 --> 55:00.096
WHEN HE WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

MYSELF."

[LAUGHTER]

55:30.427 --> 55:32.629

55:32.696 --> 55:36.800
NOW IS THEIR VERSION OF A GUS,

55:36.866 --> 55:40.170
AND IT GOES LIKE THIS.

55:40.236 --> 55:40.737
BIDEN AND OBAMA MUST DIVORCE

55:40.804 --> 55:42.205
THEIR WIVES.

56:08.998 --> 56:09.933
PRESIDENT AGAIN, BUT THERE'S

56:09.999 --> 56:10.600
NOTHING THAT SAYS HE CAN'T

BE FIRST LADY.

56:13.470 --> 56:21.711
[LAUGHTER]

56:21.778 --> 56:24.881

56:24.948 --> 56:26.149
"HUSBAND," THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

56:26.216 --> 56:28.351
WOULD GET ITS MOJO BACK AND WE'D

HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PERSON

PERSON WE REALLY WANT RUNNING

STILL HAVE VALUE.

56:35.525 --> 56:36.092
LIKE THAT EXTRA POPE THEY KEEP

IN ROME.

56:38.695 --> 56:44.667

56:44.734 --> 56:49.439

58:30.206 --> 58:32.475
FEELS PASSIONATE ABOUT.

58:32.542 --> 58:35.678
LAURA BUSH HAD LITERACY, AND

58:35.745 --> 58:36.946
MICHELLE OBAMA HAD FITNESS, AND
