WEBVTT

00:11.841 --> 00:14.483
Come on, I know we can
figure this out.

00:14.763 --> 00:17.278
We've been saying that
for three weeks now.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.712
Lady, can I get a little help
over here, please?

00:19.981 --> 00:22.622
Okay, but you don't have to yell at me.
I feel bad enough as it is.

00:23.571 --> 00:26.132
Look, it's not your fault that the
demon is one step ahead of us.

00:26.410 --> 00:29.404
Yeah, but if I hadn't lost my powers,
we would've found him by now.

00:29.707 --> 00:34.022
Well, you did, so we just have
to keep doing what we're doing.

00:34.383 --> 00:35.737
You mean,
what you've been doing.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.403
Which is pretty much everything.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.951
You're like the last sister standing.
I don't know how you're doing it.

00:41.269 --> 00:43.307
I've just been taking lots of naps.

00:43.564 --> 00:44.918
Yeah, I've noticed.

00:45.943 --> 00:50.737
You know, part of me just thinks we
should let him do his thing, you know?

00:51.120 --> 00:54.274
I mean, a demon killing other demons.
Is that so bad?

00:54.584 --> 00:57.977
Well, it is when we don't know
who it is or why they're doing it.

00:58.298 --> 01:01.691
It could be some sort of power base
coming along to take us on.

01:02.014 --> 01:03.368
Yeah.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.159
Should we get Piper
out of Magic School?

01:05.394 --> 01:07.705
No. She's safe there,
she stays.

01:07.981 --> 01:10.452
There's just no rhyme or reason
to his attacks, you know?

01:10.736 --> 01:13.172
They're just wacky.

01:15.665 --> 01:19.865
My gut says he's gonna go after
the Smoker Demons tonight.

01:20.589 --> 01:22.900
- Why?
- Because Mercury is in retrograde,

01:23.176 --> 01:26.329
and that is when they surface.

01:26.641 --> 01:28.713
That's an interesting theory.

01:28.980 --> 01:33.100
Yeah, well, all I know
is that the sooner we nail this guy,

01:33.444 --> 01:36.756
the sooner I get back to my naps.

02:12.473 --> 02:13.462
Dear God.

02:14.226 --> 02:16.662
Not quite. Guess again.
Run!

02:20.362 --> 02:21.842
Potions worked pretty well.

02:22.072 --> 02:24.907
But I still don't know why we didn't
use it on the old man instead.

02:25.203 --> 02:27.275
Because we were told not to.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.374
Now let's just get
out of here before...

02:31.924 --> 02:33.678
- They show up.
- Nuns?

02:36.266 --> 02:37.382
I don't think so.

02:44.573 --> 02:45.608
Weapon thingy.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.437
Thanks for saving my life again.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.391
Yeah, no problem.

02:57.637 --> 03:00.597
Well, at least we got a good look
at who's behind this.

03:00.893 --> 03:03.455
And better yet...

03:04.024 --> 03:05.458
...a clue to find them.

03:05.693 --> 03:07.811
Yeah, they gotta be working
for someone else.

03:08.073 --> 03:11.670
I mean, what powerful demons do you
know that would dress that tacky?

03:11.995 --> 03:12.985
Good point.

03:13.206 --> 03:16.119
<i>- I'll go check the Book of Shadows.
- No. You've done enough already.</i>

03:16.420 --> 03:19.653
I wanna do it. You just go home
and relax, take a load off.

03:19.971 --> 03:24.286
Okay. If you insist, l...
I think I will.

03:34.663 --> 03:36.940
Candles.

03:41.464 --> 03:45.301
<i>A perfect man, I summon now</i>

03:46.223 --> 03:47.943
<i>Another way I don't know how</i>

03:49.896 --> 03:53.688
<i>Bring him now into the light</i>

03:54.863 --> 03:56.935
<i>Come back to me, Mr. Right</i>

04:07.846 --> 04:09.485
Welcome back.

05:37.923 --> 05:43.047
"Dear Sad in San Jose, try Viagra."

05:43.432 --> 05:45.388
Horrible.

05:48.317 --> 05:51.596
- Long night?
- Leo! Yeah. Hey.

05:51.904 --> 05:54.899
I'm just working on trying
to find that mystery demon.

05:55.203 --> 05:58.117
Trying to come up with
some summoning spells.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.056
- Any luck?
- No, but I gave that thing

06:00.295 --> 06:01.570
that they threw at us to Chris,

06:01.800 --> 06:04.760
hoping he could get a lead with the
underworld contacts, you know?

06:09.018 --> 06:12.616
"Dear Sad in San Jose, if your husband
is impotent, try a cold shower..."

06:12.944 --> 06:14.856
- Nice spell.
- Give me that.

06:15.115 --> 06:17.346
- Don't ask.
- I'm asking.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.737
What's the matter?

06:21.375 --> 06:24.814
I don't know, I just feel like
I can't do anything anymore.

06:25.131 --> 06:26.885
And I'm beginning to think
that maybe I relied

06:27.135 --> 06:28.854
on my powers more
than I realized.

06:29.095 --> 06:31.736
No, your advice comes from your
heart, not from your powers.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.354
Besides, you were an advice columnist
long before you were an empath.

06:35.650 --> 06:37.131
Yeah, and before that, I was a witch.

06:37.361 --> 06:39.752
And before that, I don't remember
what the hell I was.

06:40.034 --> 06:41.866
I'm afraid I'm right back
to where I started.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.999
Just because you don't have your
power doesn't mean you're not a witch.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.855
You can still write spells,
make potions, kick ass.

06:49.258 --> 06:52.651
You'll find your way again,
you just have to be patient.

06:53.432 --> 06:55.425
- You promise?
- I promise.

06:56.771 --> 06:59.129
And it wouldn't hurt to rely
on Paige for a while.

06:59.402 --> 07:00.803
She relied on you for years.

07:02.366 --> 07:03.481
Where is she, by the way?

07:03.702 --> 07:05.022
She's sleeping, don't wake her.

07:05.246 --> 07:09.083
She's exhausted. She was tossing
and turning all night last night.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.339
Quiet, if my sisters find out, they'Il...

07:13.593 --> 07:15.152
Kill you. I know.

07:15.389 --> 07:17.950
Don't worry.

07:18.226 --> 07:19.899
So, what did that throwing
thing look like?

07:20.145 --> 07:21.579
<i>It's not in the Book, I checked.</i>

07:21.814 --> 07:24.489
Besides, I really wanna do this
without your help, okay?

07:24.781 --> 07:26.694
Well, I came down here to help,
remember?

07:26.951 --> 07:28.226
At least until the baby's born.

07:28.454 --> 07:30.367
And what's gonna happen
after the baby's born?

07:30.624 --> 07:33.015
- What do you mean?
- Between you and Piper.

07:33.295 --> 07:35.527
Have you guys even discussed it?

07:36.009 --> 07:36.998
Not exactly.

07:38.180 --> 07:41.618
Okay, not at all. It's just...
Things keep getting in the way.

07:41.936 --> 07:44.168
Well, Leo, you can't just
get the woman pregnant

07:44.440 --> 07:45.590
and pretend nothing happened.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.011
I'm not, okay?

07:47.610 --> 07:49.364
It's just... It's complicated.

07:49.615 --> 07:52.290
But it's not gonna get any less
complicated after Chris is born.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.803
- You talking about me?
- No, your foetus.

07:58.005 --> 07:59.836
- You find something?
- Not something. Someone.

08:00.091 --> 08:02.562
- Demonatrix.
- What you do in your spare time...

08:02.846 --> 08:04.166
The weapon belongs to a group

08:04.391 --> 08:07.750
of deadly assassins
known as Demonatrix.

08:10.528 --> 08:11.597
Find out who they work for?

08:11.820 --> 08:14.097
- No, but, Leo, check this, it's...
- Dad.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.122
Would it kill you to call him "Dad"?

08:16.373 --> 08:20.084
Apparently this demon gives
his assassins vanquishing potions.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.572
Charmed Ones vanquishing potions.

08:22.841 --> 08:23.831
What?

08:24.052 --> 08:25.406
<i>- How is that possible?
- The Book?</i>

08:25.638 --> 08:27.437
- They wouldn't be able to get it.
- Then how?

08:27.683 --> 08:30.836
Well, one of them must read minds,
like the telepath did at Magic School.

08:31.565 --> 08:33.443
- Magic School.
- Mom. I better go check on her.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.207
No, we'll go. You get underground,

08:35.446 --> 08:37.086
follow the assassins to the demon.

08:37.323 --> 08:38.599
- But...
- We'll take care of it.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.707
We'll make sure nothing
happens to her. I promise.

08:45.256 --> 08:47.327
I'll go wake up Paige.

08:53.104 --> 08:55.256
Just a minute.

08:57.485 --> 08:59.159
Sweetie, I'm sorry to wake you up.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.797
Oh, no, I'm fine.

09:02.079 --> 09:03.479
I'm fine, yeah, I'm up.

09:03.707 --> 09:06.347
Leo and I are gonna go to Magic
School and check on Piper.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.826
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

09:09.089 --> 09:11.207
Don't worry. We'll let you know
if we need you.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.461
- We'll call you, okay?
- Okay.

09:13.722 --> 09:16.113
Okay, go back to bed.

09:17.146 --> 09:18.375
My thoughts exactly.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.218
I really, really do have to go.

09:24.490 --> 09:28.567
She said not to worry about it.
So don't.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.830
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can!

09:31.088 --> 09:34.527
That's why you made me.
To focus on yourself for once.

09:34.844 --> 09:36.403
But I still have responsibilities.

09:36.639 --> 09:38.756
Yes, to yourself as well.

09:39.019 --> 09:41.740
<i>To your raison d'?tre.</i>

09:42.024 --> 09:46.578
Which, if you keep ignoring, you're
gonna be useless to your sisters.

09:50.037 --> 09:52.711
I think I made you
with too many pheromones.

09:53.001 --> 09:56.633
No, you made me to understand you,

09:56.968 --> 10:02.171
to pamper you,
to fill your every neglected need.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.599
- Yeah, but what I really need is...
- A vacation.

10:06.901 --> 10:12.104
Driving through Tuscany. Topless.

10:12.495 --> 10:15.808
- Topless?
- Not you, the Porsche.

10:16.126 --> 10:19.006
With the wind in your hair,
the sun on your face.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.294
Free, unburdened, loved.

10:24.016 --> 10:25.450
Okay, keep going.

10:25.685 --> 10:29.124
Someday, I promise, I'll take
you away from all this.

10:29.442 --> 10:33.324
But right now, you need to eat.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.782
Voil?, just the way you like it.

10:39.293 --> 10:41.046
Wait a second, you can do magic?

10:41.295 --> 10:44.415
I can do everything that you
made me do. Remember?

10:45.303 --> 10:49.664
Well, then. I don't mind if I do.

10:54.278 --> 10:58.992
Three weeks ago I came to you.

10:59.371 --> 11:02.331
And what did...? What did I say?

11:04.463 --> 11:07.741
What was the first thing I told you?

11:08.679 --> 11:11.515
Anyone? No?

11:13.603 --> 11:15.084
Let me remind you.

11:17.026 --> 11:18.302
Trust me!

11:18.529 --> 11:21.092
Trust in me,

11:21.368 --> 11:25.887
<i>and my raison d'?tre.</i>

11:27.753 --> 11:29.153
But one of you did not.

11:29.381 --> 11:31.499
I specifically told you:

11:31.763 --> 11:35.281
The Smoker Demons would make their
move when Mercury was in retrograde.

11:35.602 --> 11:39.997
And I told you the sisters
would figure that out.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.400
I'm sorry, Vincent. You know
that I live only to please you.

11:44.367 --> 11:45.358
Shut up.

11:50.419 --> 11:54.415
<i>What once resided in this place
Shall soon be gone with no haste</i>

11:54.759 --> 11:59.359
<i>Make this girl age in time
As punishment for her heinous crime</i>

12:06.489 --> 12:07.479
Well...

12:08.869 --> 12:10.018
...any questions?

12:11.038 --> 12:13.999
No? Good.

12:14.295 --> 12:16.127
To reiterate...

12:19.179 --> 12:21.695
...I don't want the sisters finding me.

12:22.059 --> 12:23.573
Especially Paige.

12:23.813 --> 12:25.041
Not until I'm ready.

12:31.492 --> 12:34.009
Which demon are we after next?

12:34.288 --> 12:36.440
Not a demon.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.827
A Porsche.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.986
Sorry, Piper, it must be checked out.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.134
- Can I come down now?
- Not yet.

12:45.393 --> 12:48.353
<i>Check Lozordo's Book of Prophecies,
volume one.</i>

12:48.649 --> 12:50.242
Okay.

12:51.611 --> 12:54.491
Levitating, not my favourite.
It's very...

12:55.035 --> 12:56.628
...high.

12:57.414 --> 12:59.008
- Surprise!
- Hey!

12:59.251 --> 13:01.368
Hi, I didn't know
you guys were coming.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.797
- Is something wrong?
- No, why would something be wrong?

13:06.095 --> 13:08.291
Does something have to be
wrong for me to come visit?

13:08.559 --> 13:10.152
Usually.

13:10.396 --> 13:13.869
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Good, you found it. Float on down.

13:16.155 --> 13:17.350
Oh, the good old days.

13:17.574 --> 13:19.213
We don't wanna worry her,
remember?

13:19.452 --> 13:20.602
Yes, I know it.

13:20.830 --> 13:24.348
- So, what you been doing?
- Oh, you know, same old, same old.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.902
Trying to figure out
who turns Wyatt evil.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.449
By the way, have you seen Chris?

13:29.469 --> 13:31.108
Yeah, we have him working
on something.

13:31.348 --> 13:33.021
But nothing big,
nothing to worry about.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.864
Just your everyday demon stuff.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.630
Okay, well, if you see him,

13:37.861 --> 13:40.092
tell him I'd like to talk to him
when he has a chance.

13:40.366 --> 13:42.723
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

13:43.788 --> 13:44.858
Where do we start?

13:45.081 --> 13:46.436
Sigmund, is Gideon around?

13:46.667 --> 13:48.182
He's conferring with the other Elders,

13:48.421 --> 13:50.778
which, if I may say so,
is where you should be too.

13:51.051 --> 13:52.451
Can I help you?

13:53.804 --> 13:56.446
Just trying to get a premonition,
see if you're legit.

13:57.478 --> 13:58.912
You don't have premonitions anymore.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.821
It doesn't hurt to try.

14:02.614 --> 14:05.050
Sigmund, have you noticed
any breaches in security?

14:05.327 --> 14:07.524
Students, teachers,
anyone suspicious?

14:07.788 --> 14:10.020
- None that I know of. Why?
- Never mind.

14:11.295 --> 14:12.888
Just keep an eye out around Piper.

14:13.131 --> 14:14.691
Of course.

14:16.598 --> 14:17.587
Do you believe him?

14:17.807 --> 14:19.035
No reason not to,

14:19.268 --> 14:22.103
which means the demon could be
tapping into your mind or Paige's.

14:22.398 --> 14:24.834
All right. I'll go back to the house
and keep an eye on Paige.

14:25.113 --> 14:28.073
You stay here and maybe
you and Piper can talk.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.537
- What are you doing?
- Trying to orb.

14:34.796 --> 14:38.074
- You don't orb.
- Now is not the time to rub that in.

14:38.386 --> 14:41.060
A little help here, please.

14:44.687 --> 14:46.600
Hey, where did she go?

14:47.317 --> 14:49.115
Back to work. Deadlines.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.124
Can I help?

14:59.924 --> 15:03.363
The Carrera S4. Excellent choice.

15:03.681 --> 15:07.313
Turbo styling, all-wheel drive,
zero to 60 in under five seconds.

15:07.644 --> 15:11.037
You wanna feel the wind in your face?
This is definitely the car for you.

15:11.361 --> 15:13.478
- May I?
- Oh, absolutely.

15:13.742 --> 15:16.132
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to put that out first.

15:16.412 --> 15:17.972
Of course.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.770
Thank you.

15:28.642 --> 15:32.604
Beautiful, isn't it?
No other car sounds like it.

15:33.983 --> 15:36.419
She'll love it. We'll take it.

15:36.696 --> 15:38.848
Excellent. Cash or lease?

15:40.414 --> 15:44.933
- No. We'll just take it.
- What?

15:47.050 --> 15:49.202
No! Rolls.

15:53.479 --> 15:55.676
I told you, we don't hurt innocents.

15:55.941 --> 15:57.341
Well, that's a new one.

15:59.279 --> 16:00.759
You!

16:40.101 --> 16:42.253
Stop him! He's trying to steal it!

16:43.983 --> 16:47.103
- Don't move.
- Unbelievable.

16:50.244 --> 16:54.240
I promise I will have the column
in by the deadline.

16:54.587 --> 16:56.226
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm finishing up.

16:58.342 --> 17:00.254
I gotta go. Ticktock, ticktock.

17:00.514 --> 17:03.155
- Finally. Where have you been?
- Jail.

17:03.437 --> 17:04.916
- What?
- Don't worry. It's fine.

17:05.147 --> 17:07.868
Nobody saw me orb out and I talked
to Darryl. He's gonna cover for me.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.507
How did you end up in jail?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.970
Let's say I had a little run-in
with our mystery demon.

17:12.242 --> 17:14.280
And when I say run-in,
I mean literally.

17:14.539 --> 17:17.932
The guy, he tried to run me over
with his Porsche. Not cool!

17:18.797 --> 17:21.837
A demon that drives a Porsche?
That's different.

17:22.134 --> 17:23.773
So is one who can orb
and saves innocents.

17:24.012 --> 17:26.686
Forget tapping into us.
It sounds like he wants to be us.

17:26.976 --> 17:29.856
- Why?
- Why else? To kill us.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.339
- Did you find him? Where is he?
- Yeah. He's here.

17:34.656 --> 17:38.573
- Here? Where here?
- Paige.

17:38.914 --> 17:41.349
Paige, are you oka...?

17:42.172 --> 17:44.004
- What are you doing?
- You?

17:45.511 --> 17:48.026
Just napping?

17:54.650 --> 17:56.802
Paige, I don't even
wanna talk about this!

17:57.073 --> 17:58.905
I mean, how could you
do such a thing?

17:59.160 --> 18:01.197
Oh, what, like you've never
conjured stuff before?

18:01.454 --> 18:04.732
Yeah, well, never for myself
and never a sex toy!

18:05.044 --> 18:07.161
- I am not a sex toy.
- Quiet, you.

18:07.425 --> 18:10.146
- Well, we did it for Piper before.
- Yes, but that was different.

18:10.430 --> 18:14.028
We were trying to convince her to not
give up on love. We were desperate.

18:14.352 --> 18:16.106
Well, maybe I am too.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.747
Excuse me, shouldn't we be focusing
on the bigger issue here?

18:21.406 --> 18:24.287
- How long has this been going on?
- About three weeks.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.971
- Three weeks!
- Give or take.

18:28.461 --> 18:30.693
You're the one who kept telling me
I needed a break.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.799
Yes, but I meant take a day off,
you know,

18:33.054 --> 18:36.049
go to the spa, have a pedicure,
get a massage!

18:36.352 --> 18:38.265
I massage her.

18:40.274 --> 18:42.232
Breathe. Okay, what I
wanna know is,

18:42.486 --> 18:44.877
how come when we were scrying
for the demon, we got him?

18:46.118 --> 18:47.108
- I don't know.
- You might wanna know

18:47.328 --> 18:49.718
because he looks a lot like
the guy who just tried to kill me.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.831
What? Now, that is impossible.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.684
Didn't the demon start killing the
other demons around the same time?

18:56.012 --> 18:59.370
I'm telling you, there is no way he's
a demon, I made him to be good.

18:59.685 --> 19:02.359
Well, maybe you also made
one to be bad. I don't know.

19:02.647 --> 19:05.082
- No!
- How do you explain the scrying, then?

19:05.362 --> 19:07.594
And the fact that he makes potions
and has your powers?

19:07.866 --> 19:09.937
Talk about your
personal-gain consequences.

19:10.203 --> 19:14.085
Personal gain. I am so tired... If I hear
those two words again, I tell you what...

19:14.418 --> 19:18.699
Nevertheless, it's there for a reason.
It's why Phoebe lost her powers.

19:19.969 --> 19:21.245
Whose side are you on?

19:21.891 --> 19:24.647
I know what you know, Paige.
And we both know they're right.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.785
Well, did you conjure him
or clone him?

19:28.026 --> 19:29.096
Okay, this is so stupid.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.882
Why don't we just un-conjure him
so they'll both go away?

19:32.159 --> 19:34.516
I can't. I make him to last
for 24 hours.

19:34.789 --> 19:36.142
The spell's not done yet.

19:37.668 --> 19:40.230
Great, so how long
do we have to wait?

19:41.425 --> 19:42.619
Like till after midnight.

19:43.761 --> 19:46.642
Well, let's just hope we find him
before he finds us.

19:49.274 --> 19:51.551
Maybe that's another one of your
suitors you've conjured

19:51.820 --> 19:53.811
for your own personal
gain and pleasure.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.393
Oh, I hope so.

19:55.617 --> 19:56.938
No offence.

19:58.581 --> 20:02.258
Hey, Darryl,
now's not really a good time.

20:03.173 --> 20:04.162
I'm here about Chris.

20:04.383 --> 20:06.660
Yeah, he told me you covered for him,
that was great.

20:08.765 --> 20:10.642
- I'm taking him back.
- What?

20:10.894 --> 20:13.171
Wait, what's going on?

20:13.441 --> 20:14.716
- Take him back to county.
- Hey!

20:14.944 --> 20:17.016
- A little help, please?
- What do you want me to do?

20:17.279 --> 20:19.842
- Let's go.
- Chris, don't worry, we'll figure it out.

20:20.118 --> 20:23.112
- Darryl?
- No.

20:23.416 --> 20:26.535
Don't even ask.
This time it's by the book.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.673
- Do you understand?
- Why?

20:28.927 --> 20:32.524
Why? Because I almost got killed
covering for you last time, that's why.

20:32.849 --> 20:36.367
Okay, but we always
almost get killed.

20:36.691 --> 20:39.685
Well, last time was different.
Way different.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.582
I'm not going through that again.

20:41.825 --> 20:47.062
I'm not putting my family through
that again. You understand?

20:47.459 --> 20:49.099
We'll just have to get him
out ourselves.

20:49.337 --> 20:51.853
And risk exposing magic?
I don't think so.

20:53.260 --> 20:56.095
Listen to me, Phoebe.
I'm not covering for you anymore.

20:57.394 --> 20:59.226
I mean it.

21:03.864 --> 21:07.097
Could this day get any worse?

21:14.300 --> 21:16.656
- Well?
- The car is waiting for you.

21:16.929 --> 21:18.728
As you wish.

21:18.973 --> 21:22.366
It's beautiful this time of year, isn't it?
In Florence.

21:22.689 --> 21:24.760
As good a place as any
to kill a Charmed One.

21:25.027 --> 21:27.941
It's not for killing one.
It's for loving one.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.232
For loving Paige.

21:30.493 --> 21:32.690
But I thought you said that...

21:32.955 --> 21:34.595
That's for after.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.648
When she's by my side.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.273
When I can give her what she wants
more than anything.

21:40.596 --> 21:44.478
Freedom, independence, power.

21:45.686 --> 21:47.519
But doesn't she already have power?

21:47.773 --> 21:49.413
Not the kind that gives
her independence.

21:49.655 --> 21:56.213
Still, with all due respect,
how do you know what she wants?

21:57.166 --> 21:59.159
Because it's what I want.

21:59.420 --> 22:00.615
We are one and the same.

22:00.839 --> 22:04.278
I exist solely to please her.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.216
And I intend on doing exactly that.

22:07.476 --> 22:08.626
How will you get to her?

22:10.564 --> 22:11.918
I won't have to.

22:12.150 --> 22:13.141
She'll come to me.

22:14.030 --> 22:18.266
After all, she knows my every move.

22:34.317 --> 22:36.115
What?

22:37.780 --> 22:39.613
Nothing.

22:44.501 --> 22:45.491
What?

22:46.130 --> 22:47.358
Nothing.

22:47.590 --> 22:50.026
I mean, thanks for helping with this.

22:51.054 --> 22:52.568
Well, he's my son too.

22:52.808 --> 22:54.242
Yeah, what about your other son?

22:54.477 --> 22:55.991
How are you and Chris
getting along?

22:56.230 --> 22:58.747
- Better?
- I hope so. I don't know.

22:59.026 --> 23:01.303
I mean, it is so hard
for me to wrap my mind

23:01.573 --> 23:03.929
around the idea
that he has issues with me

23:04.203 --> 23:07.437
because he hasn't even technically
been born yet.

23:07.751 --> 23:09.789
Well, that's our boy.

23:10.046 --> 23:12.562
And hopefully you'll get
a second chance with him.

23:14.221 --> 23:15.211
Hopefully.

23:16.601 --> 23:18.639
What about with you?

23:18.897 --> 23:26.776
I mean, we haven't even really talked
about us since we, well, you know.

23:27.288 --> 23:29.519
Yeah, I do know.

23:32.421 --> 23:36.383
- Have you thought about it?
- Of course. I have. A lot.

23:36.719 --> 23:40.682
But honestly, I can't even go there.

23:41.478 --> 23:43.550
I mean, it's not an option, is it?

23:43.816 --> 23:45.296
You're still an Elder.

23:48.489 --> 23:50.322
Hey, I'm not interrupting, am I?

23:50.576 --> 23:53.331
Actually, kind of.
As a matter of fact, you are.

23:53.626 --> 23:55.140
- Could you...?
- Sorry.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.340
See, I had to talk to Leo
about something real quick.

23:58.634 --> 24:00.114
- Come with me.
- All right, that's it.

24:00.345 --> 24:02.815
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

24:03.099 --> 24:06.333
Come on, I'm pregnant, not stupid.
What is it?

24:09.070 --> 24:10.663
Well, we didn't want to alarm you.

24:10.906 --> 24:14.901
But there is a demon consolidating
powers using Charmed knowledge.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.681
- What?
- Yeah, and see the problem is,

24:17.958 --> 24:20.759
I kind of conjured him,
the Mr. Right version of him, and...

24:21.049 --> 24:24.680
Wait, wait. Mr. Right, as in,
my Mr. Right?

24:25.514 --> 24:28.313
No, that would be gross.
My Mr. Right.

24:28.602 --> 24:30.161
- There are rules.
- Oh, please. Listen.

24:30.397 --> 24:32.071
You're confusing me.
That's not why I'm here.

24:32.317 --> 24:34.310
I came to tell you that Chris
has been arrested.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.964
- But it's a long story.
- Did you call Darryl?

24:37.244 --> 24:38.678
Yes, that would be
the other problem

24:38.913 --> 24:40.506
because Darryl arrested him.
Longer story.

24:42.211 --> 24:43.247
Okay, take me home.

24:43.463 --> 24:45.261
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
You stay here.

24:45.509 --> 24:48.184
No, I can't stay here when all hell
is breaking loose there.

24:48.472 --> 24:50.749
Stay here, you save one son,
I'll go save the other.

25:00.911 --> 25:01.980
Can I come in?

25:02.205 --> 25:05.005
Shouldn't you be off peeling Paige
a grape or something?

25:05.293 --> 25:09.130
She doesn't like grapes.
Actually, she's not back yet.

25:11.096 --> 25:12.290
What are you doing?

25:12.514 --> 25:14.825
I'm making a vanquishing potion
for your evil twin.

25:15.104 --> 25:17.494
- Or at least I'm trying to.
- Maybe I can help.

25:17.775 --> 25:20.007
No, I think you've done enough
already, thank you.

25:20.279 --> 25:22.476
Okay.

25:22.742 --> 25:26.340
Look, I know you're mad at her and me
and you have every right to be.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.577
I know.

25:29.378 --> 25:30.573
But you know Paige.

25:32.092 --> 25:34.483
She doesn't think it's fair for magic
to take away so much,

25:34.764 --> 25:36.118
without ever giving anything back.

25:36.349 --> 25:39.070
- Yeah, but that still doesn't justify...
- I know. It doesn't.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.418
She was going crazy.

25:41.649 --> 25:42.924
She was overloaded.

25:43.152 --> 25:44.586
She didn't wanna complain.

25:44.822 --> 25:48.181
She didn't want you to have to feel
guilty for having lost your powers.

25:49.537 --> 25:53.692
Just don't stay mad
at her too long, okay?

25:55.256 --> 25:56.291
It hurts her, Phoebe.

25:57.971 --> 25:59.291
She looks up to you.

25:59.515 --> 26:00.835
A lot more than you know.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.095
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:05.442 --> 26:08.960
I think you're missing one key
ingredient for this potion to work.

26:09.283 --> 26:13.565
My blood. After all, it's his too.

26:13.915 --> 26:16.750
- Ouch, doesn't it hurt?
- No.

26:17.045 --> 26:18.719
I only feel what Paige feels.

26:18.966 --> 26:21.435
After all, I'm not real.

26:22.347 --> 26:27.948
Although the more I come back,
the more I wish I was.

26:30.612 --> 26:33.890
Phoebe, I thought about it, and I
just wanted to say that you're right...

26:34.202 --> 26:38.801
Stop. You apologized already.
It's okay.

26:41.632 --> 26:44.353
Okay, so we have the potion,
all we need is the demon.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.469
Any idea who he'll go after next?

26:46.725 --> 26:48.444
- Kimoto Demon.
- Kimoto Demon.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.462
- I like the way you think.
- Right back at you.

27:04.130 --> 27:05.450
Looks like we're too late.

27:05.674 --> 27:08.634
Actually, you're right on time.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.050
- So glad you could make it.
- Paige, throw the potion.

27:12.855 --> 27:14.255
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

27:16.067 --> 27:17.627
- Paige.
- Give me that.

27:21.203 --> 27:24.801
Sorry. Paige didn't conjure me
to go away until it's time.

27:28.589 --> 27:30.343
You can't resist me, remember?

27:37.983 --> 27:40.214
What's going on?

27:41.405 --> 27:43.124
Where am I?

27:43.367 --> 27:45.837
You're home, Paige.

27:52.258 --> 27:53.897
"Use my blood," you said.

27:54.135 --> 27:55.889
"It's his blood too," you said.

27:56.139 --> 27:57.812
How was I to know
the potion wouldn't work?

27:58.059 --> 27:59.048
I thought you knew him.

27:59.272 --> 28:01.424
No, I said I knew Paige.
There's a difference.

28:01.693 --> 28:03.447
What? Testicles?

28:03.696 --> 28:05.575
I thought you guys were like
three peas in a pod.

28:05.824 --> 28:08.659
No, Paige is real, we're not.
Remember?

28:09.414 --> 28:12.647
He's right. She didn't make them
vulnerable. She didn't want them to go.

28:12.963 --> 28:15.081
Until it's time.

28:15.341 --> 28:16.776
We have to find her
before midnight.

28:17.010 --> 28:18.570
God knows what he'll do
to her by then.

28:18.805 --> 28:21.845
He won't hurt her. He loves her.
That much I know.

28:22.142 --> 28:24.419
- That's why she went with him.
- But why is she staying?

28:24.691 --> 28:27.411
Why hasn't she orbed out of there?
She may want a lot of crazy things

28:27.697 --> 28:29.211
but she'd never
wanna be with a demon.

28:29.449 --> 28:32.602
Don't count on it. Paige has
a dark side like everybody else.

28:32.913 --> 28:36.191
He's appealing to that.
To what she secretly wants.

28:36.503 --> 28:39.941
- And what is that?
- To be free, independent.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.457
To be able to use her magic
without fear of consequence.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.874
That's extremely seductive to her.

28:45.144 --> 28:48.741
- And so are those pheromones I bet.
- Especially when used by evil.

28:49.068 --> 28:50.980
We gotta figure out a way
to vanquish this guy.

28:51.238 --> 28:53.994
Yeah, but how?
She made him invincible.

28:54.286 --> 28:55.402
Then why not make him real?

28:56.581 --> 28:58.061
Break our magical bond.

28:59.252 --> 29:00.811
I'm sorry?

29:01.046 --> 29:02.879
It's what Paige would do
if she was here.

29:03.134 --> 29:06.732
I mean, I know it's a wacky,
but it might work.

29:07.056 --> 29:08.649
It would make him
vulnerable to a potion.

29:08.894 --> 29:12.252
<i>Guys, this is not Pinocchio.
We can't just make things real.</i>

29:12.567 --> 29:14.764
You're not making things real.
Just him.

29:15.030 --> 29:17.341
And he's already halfway there
just by being conjured.

29:20.163 --> 29:21.836
I know you can do it, Phoebe.

29:22.503 --> 29:24.939
Thanks, Paige.

29:25.216 --> 29:27.652
- Still, it doesn't help us to find her.
- But maybe we can.

29:27.929 --> 29:29.648
Or maybe Chris can,
like he did before.

29:29.890 --> 29:31.404
Have you forgotten he's in jail?

29:31.643 --> 29:33.840
Not for long he's not.

29:35.692 --> 29:40.211
Well, looks like I'm the last sister
standing now. You, come on.

29:46.168 --> 29:48.364
It's an exact duplicate.

29:48.632 --> 29:50.305
Exactly as you know it.

29:50.551 --> 29:56.188
Of course, given time, I can
re-create the entire house. For you.

30:01.987 --> 30:03.785
Well?

30:04.035 --> 30:06.072
What do you think?

30:06.957 --> 30:09.632
My head's still spinning.

30:09.919 --> 30:13.039
It's hard for you to accept when good
things happen to you. I know.

30:13.341 --> 30:16.177
But this is everything you've
ever dreamed about,

30:16.474 --> 30:17.463
wanted.

30:18.518 --> 30:21.479
Instead of fighting you,
the demons will bow down to your feet.

30:21.773 --> 30:26.567
Instead of reining in your powers,
you can use them at will.

30:26.949 --> 30:28.542
You're free...

30:28.786 --> 30:30.460
...unchallenged...

30:30.707 --> 30:32.187
...loved.

30:32.418 --> 30:34.776
- Why, Vincent?
- You don't remember?

30:36.425 --> 30:40.500
The name of your first love.
A boy who promised you the world.

30:40.849 --> 30:42.249
Now you've got it.

30:46.151 --> 30:49.703
- But, what about my...?
- Your sisters.

30:50.450 --> 30:51.851
They're a burden, aren't they?

30:52.078 --> 30:57.236
Forever forcing you to sacrifice
yourself, your needs for them.

30:57.631 --> 30:59.782
You're right. It's not fair.

31:00.051 --> 31:02.202
No, it's not.

31:02.471 --> 31:04.703
And unfortunately,
unless we do something,

31:04.977 --> 31:06.536
they'll try to stop us, won't they?

31:19.126 --> 31:20.481
We need to talk.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.264
Hello, Leo, I knew you'd show
up sooner or later.

31:26.139 --> 31:29.178
Darryl, Paige is in trouble.

31:29.479 --> 31:31.995
A demon took her
and I need Chris to help find her.

31:32.276 --> 31:33.790
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

31:34.571 --> 31:35.720
What is that supposed to mean?

31:35.947 --> 31:38.018
Exactly what it sounds like.

31:38.285 --> 31:41.120
Look, I told the girls
and now I'm telling you.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.455
I'm not doing any more.
Forget it.

31:44.464 --> 31:46.184
- Look, I understand...
- No, hey!

31:46.426 --> 31:48.224
You don't understand.

31:48.470 --> 31:49.744
It's over, Leo.

31:50.890 --> 31:54.363
One of those beings
who erase memories

31:54.690 --> 31:57.160
allowed me to remember
what happened after last time.

31:57.445 --> 32:00.325
I changed. I saw the light.

32:00.616 --> 32:02.926
This is your fight. It's not mine.

32:03.204 --> 32:04.957
Well, I am fighting to try
and save my sons.

32:05.207 --> 32:06.527
All right, they are in trouble.

32:06.755 --> 32:08.633
Wyatt might be in trouble too.
You're a father.

32:08.883 --> 32:12.196
I'm a cop! And all I know is...

32:12.514 --> 32:18.115
All I'm supposed to know is,
Chris got caught stealing a car.

32:18.525 --> 32:19.844
That's it.

32:20.070 --> 32:23.144
Son or no son, he's busted.

32:23.450 --> 32:26.729
Sooner or later they are gonna figure
out who he is and then what, huh?

32:30.001 --> 32:30.991
That's not my problem.

32:31.713 --> 32:33.831
Excuse me.

32:51.165 --> 32:52.804
- It took you long enough.
- Not so loud.

32:53.043 --> 32:55.080
- I'm getting you out of here.
- Great.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.459
- So Darryl's gonna cover?
- Forget about Darryl. Come on.

32:58.762 --> 33:02.440
We're just gonna orb out of here?
What about exposure?

33:02.770 --> 33:04.966
Right now I'm more worried
about them exposing you.

33:05.232 --> 33:07.030
- Yeah, but...
- Look, son,

33:08.445 --> 33:11.087
I'm not gonna let you hang here.
Come on, you got an aunt to save.

33:18.088 --> 33:19.078
Thanks, Dad.

33:25.434 --> 33:28.076
- Does that mean it's done?
- Or overdone.

33:28.358 --> 33:32.035
- I'm not so sure about this.
- Well, why don't we try it out?

33:32.364 --> 33:34.516
- On me.
- Are you kidding?

33:34.785 --> 33:35.774
It might kill you.

33:35.996 --> 33:38.068
Well, then at least
you'd know I was real.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.210
Look, if it works on me,
it's gonna work on him, right?

33:46.557 --> 33:48.550
Okay.

33:53.775 --> 33:56.850
- How do you feel?
- Alive.

34:03.376 --> 34:06.450
- What are you doing?
- Seeing how much I feel.

34:08.384 --> 34:09.373
Ow!

34:10.014 --> 34:12.007
"Ow" is good, though, right?
"Ow" means you're...

34:12.937 --> 34:16.694
I'm real! I can't believe it.

34:17.027 --> 34:18.176
This is amazing.

34:19.197 --> 34:21.234
You have no idea what
you've done for me, Phoebe.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.246
I hope you didn't trick me
into doing that.

34:23.496 --> 34:28.052
No, but I did help you realize you're
not as powerless as you thought.

34:33.513 --> 34:35.072
- Chris, you're out!
- Yeah. Thank God.

34:35.309 --> 34:37.188
So how's that potion coming?
Did it work?

34:37.438 --> 34:40.034
- Perfectly.
- Okay, great.

34:40.317 --> 34:42.150
Chris has an idea
on how you can find Paige.

34:42.405 --> 34:43.998
- Me?
- You're gonna have to sneak in.

34:44.241 --> 34:47.632
And then once you're in, we'll bring you
the potion that makes the demon real.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.279
And how exactly
am I gonna sneak in?

35:02.566 --> 35:05.446
- You're right on time.
- My aim is to please.

35:05.739 --> 35:07.537
- Where's Paige?
- Coming.

35:07.784 --> 35:09.424
You know that she can't
be a part of this.

35:09.662 --> 35:11.255
At least not directly.

35:11.499 --> 35:15.336
- They are, after all, still her sisters.
- I understand.

35:20.055 --> 35:21.854
Paige, what are we doing here?

35:22.100 --> 35:24.297
You know how I've always
felt tied down?

35:24.564 --> 35:26.955
Well, I thought you'd like
to know how that feels.

35:27.235 --> 35:29.033
Rope!

35:30.615 --> 35:32.447
What the hell are you doing?

35:34.624 --> 35:36.421
Paige.

35:42.261 --> 35:44.333
Paige?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.379
Leo?

35:52.614 --> 35:53.809
Chris?

35:59.251 --> 36:00.651
I missed.

36:11.063 --> 36:13.783
- It's just me, it's Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

36:14.071 --> 36:16.462
Are you here to save me or kill me?

36:16.742 --> 36:18.416
I haven't decided yet, turn around.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.358
Okay, is there a plan involved
in any of this?

36:23.669 --> 36:26.744
Well, there was until Chris and Leo
didn't respond to your call.

36:27.050 --> 36:28.451
Great.

36:30.975 --> 36:32.773
Something's wrong,
I can't sense her.

36:33.018 --> 36:34.338
- I'm going back.
- You can't.

36:34.562 --> 36:36.236
Leo, she needs the potion,
all right?

36:36.482 --> 36:37.882
It's too dangerous.
I'm not risking you too.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.142
Phoebe will figure it out,
she always finds a way.

36:43.079 --> 36:44.513
Let me see if I can get a clear shot.

36:44.747 --> 36:46.865
And risk exposing the baby,
absolutely not.

36:47.126 --> 36:51.008
This is what we'll do. I am going
to go after the two on the right first.

36:51.342 --> 36:54.496
- Okay, then what?
- Then go after the two on the left.

36:54.809 --> 36:56.038
Oh, sure.

36:56.268 --> 36:57.782
- Okay, ready?
- No.

36:58.021 --> 36:59.011
- Go!
- No!

37:12.131 --> 37:14.600
Hey, not bad for a chick
who can't levitate.

37:14.885 --> 37:17.447
- We're not done yet.
- You said you didn't have the potion.

37:17.723 --> 37:19.157
We don't need it.

37:25.862 --> 37:27.297
All right, break it up, you two!

37:28.200 --> 37:30.397
Phoebe! I'm impressed.

37:30.664 --> 37:33.099
- I underestimated you.
- Really?

37:33.375 --> 37:36.450
Well, that means she did too, and I'm
not quite sure how I feel about that.

37:36.758 --> 37:38.238
Blow him up.

37:38.469 --> 37:40.906
You can't, I'm not real. Remember?

37:42.184 --> 37:45.463
I'm betting on if Mr. Right is real,
then so are you. Just do it.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.996
What are you wearing?

38:06.476 --> 38:08.993
- Dada.
- Hey, slugger.

38:10.816 --> 38:12.409
How's your Mommy doing?
Is she all right?

38:13.904 --> 38:18.298
As long as one of her sisters doesn't
try to kill her again, she'll be fine.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.023
Well, now you know why
we didn't tell you about it.

38:21.297 --> 38:24.257
I'm glad you did. Otherwise,
I would be totally in the dark

38:24.592 --> 38:25.742
when Paige kidnapped me.

38:25.970 --> 38:30.171
- Have you forgiven her yet?
- No, not to her face anyway.

38:30.520 --> 38:33.161
But that's okay.
She can suffer a little bit.

38:34.736 --> 38:36.295
So, what's going on with Chris?

38:37.322 --> 38:38.881
The car salesman dropped
the charges.

38:39.118 --> 38:42.317
He had a sudden loss of memory.

38:42.625 --> 38:45.379
- Wouldn't testify. Go figure.
- Leo.

38:45.673 --> 38:48.347
Magic was already exposed,
so I had to do something, right?

38:52.391 --> 38:55.669
- You know, you're a good father.
- Yeah?

38:57.358 --> 38:59.590
Thanks.

38:59.864 --> 39:02.140
I hope you say that again
in 23 years.

39:03.412 --> 39:06.611
I wonder where we'll be then.

39:10.008 --> 39:11.236
Me too.

39:26.327 --> 39:30.084
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, how you doing?

39:30.418 --> 39:32.138
How's the column? Did you finish?

39:32.380 --> 39:34.657
I did, just barely.

39:34.927 --> 39:38.046
But at least Sad in San Jose
won't be so sad anymore.

39:38.348 --> 39:41.422
See, you didn't need your powers
to give good advice.

39:41.731 --> 39:44.452
Wait a second, you didn't get
your powers back, did you?

39:44.736 --> 39:47.457
No. And I'm not in any
hurry to either.

39:47.741 --> 39:51.897
I think we've both been relying on our
powers a bit too much, don't you?

39:52.625 --> 39:55.586
Oh, subtle, very subtle.
That's what I like about you.

39:56.257 --> 39:59.490
All the same, I'm not entirely sure
what I was thinking.

39:59.804 --> 40:01.842
Well, you were thinking
that you needed a break.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.155
And those needs came
from a real place,

40:04.395 --> 40:07.628
you just have to figure out a way
to honour them without using magic.

40:10.156 --> 40:11.556
Got any advice for him?

40:12.285 --> 40:14.356
No, you're on your own
with that one.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.318
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

40:21.886 --> 40:23.879
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:24.141 --> 40:25.131
You all set?

40:25.976 --> 40:29.016
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.

40:29.316 --> 40:30.590
I'm a little nervous.

40:31.485 --> 40:32.522
Well, don't worry.

40:32.737 --> 40:34.889
Leo will take good care of you.

40:35.159 --> 40:38.997
He's the best. And he's come and
gone from this world several times.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.076
So have I. Thanks to you.

40:43.171 --> 40:44.447
Well, don't thank me just yet.

40:44.674 --> 40:49.547
If you're anything like me, and I have
a sneaking suspicion that you are,

40:49.935 --> 40:52.770
you might get into a little
bit of trouble out there.

40:53.064 --> 40:55.660
Well, if I'm anything like you,
I can handle it.

40:55.945 --> 40:56.934
Right?

41:03.500 --> 41:04.695
Will I ever see you again?

41:06.589 --> 41:09.550
Only if you get in too much trouble.

41:19.195 --> 41:20.949
Well...

41:21.491 --> 41:23.165
- Take care.
- Take care.
