- Bob: <i>Hey, honey.</i>
- Hi.

00:06.449 --> 00:09.017
- What you got there?
- Oh, it's a wonderful painting

00:09.051 --> 00:10.452
By an up-and-coming
artist named,

00:10.486 --> 00:13.121
Huh, amy duncan.

00:13.155 --> 00:16.024
That's right.
Hey, you had your first
art class tonight.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.626
- How'd that go?
- I don't know, you tell me.

00:18.661 --> 00:20.328
Ba-bam.

00:22.098 --> 00:24.899
- What is it?
- It's obvious.

00:28.537 --> 00:32.006
Oh!  Oh, I know.
It's three eggs
in a nest.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.443
No, wait.
No, it's a baked potato
with three pats of butter.

00:36.879 --> 00:39.481
Dad, you see that
in every painting.

00:39.515 --> 00:43.685
Oh, I think it's baby chicks
eating out of a football.

00:44.854 --> 00:46.788
Lemons, okay?

00:46.822 --> 00:48.389
It's a bowl of lemons.

00:49.558 --> 00:50.992
All: Oh.

00:52.128 --> 00:54.062
You people have
no appreciation for art.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.097
Oh, come on, honey.
Honey.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.866
- What?
- Come on,
you know what they say--

00:57.900 --> 00:59.968
If life gives you
a bowl of lemons...

01:00.002 --> 01:03.004
That's not
very well painted...

01:04.807 --> 01:08.676
Then you should make--
make dinner?

01:09.678 --> 01:11.613
Good save, dad.

- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing here?

02:15.711 --> 02:17.579
Did you come to see me sign up
for the battle of the bands?

02:17.613 --> 02:20.915
Or maybe teddy bear
is here to see me.

02:21.951 --> 02:23.785
Okay, so the topic is

02:23.819 --> 02:26.588
"insane reasons
why teddy's at the mall."

02:26.622 --> 02:30.024
No no no,
<i>I'm</i> here to sign up
for battle of the bands.

02:30.059 --> 02:32.293
- You have a band?
- Yes, I do.

02:32.328 --> 02:34.896
My friend skyler
and I have been working
on some music.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.432
- <i>( girl giggles )</i>
- oh no-- spencer.

02:37.466 --> 02:41.402
- Man, if he's in
this thing, we are toast.
- He's a complete package

02:41.437 --> 02:45.406
With the singing, the dancing
and the sparkly smiling.

02:45.441 --> 02:47.976
Excuse me.
Hey, guys.

02:48.010 --> 02:49.711
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm.

02:49.745 --> 02:52.247
So you're-- you're--
you have a band now?

02:52.281 --> 02:55.049
- No, I'm gonna
perform alone.
- Huh.

02:55.084 --> 02:57.752
Because this is
battle of the bands

02:57.786 --> 03:00.154
And I'm pretty sure
the word "band" implies group,

03:00.189 --> 03:01.623
I.E., more than one.

03:01.657 --> 03:02.824
I mean, I could be wrong,

03:02.858 --> 03:05.093
But I don't--
don't think so.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.764
Actually, I called
and they said I could
perform alone--

03:09.798 --> 03:12.033
Something about
drawing a bigger crowd.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.568
No, I don't know.

03:13.602 --> 03:16.938
I should
get back in line,
so good luck.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.610
You know something?
His teeth were <i>not</i>
that sparkly.

03:22.645 --> 03:24.112
That's just
what I was thinking.

03:24.146 --> 03:26.414
Dude, we're gonna win
this thing because
we are so insane.

03:26.448 --> 03:27.849
- We're so insane.
Fist bump.
- Up top.

03:27.883 --> 03:30.084
- Fist-- fist bump.  Up top.
- Up top.  Fist bump.

03:30.119 --> 03:32.987
- Okay, stop stop stop.
- We've done this before.
Oh, wait.

03:38.494 --> 03:40.628

- Hey. ( chuckles )

03:41.830 --> 03:43.498
What you got there?

03:43.532 --> 03:46.968
A brand-new mytab.
My best friend lucas
gave it to me.

03:47.002 --> 03:50.171
Lucas?  Never heard of him.
How long have you guys
been best friends?

03:50.205 --> 03:53.174
Since 3:00 today when
he gave me this mytab.

03:55.244 --> 03:57.478
Sounds like he's trying
to buy your friendship.

03:57.513 --> 03:59.447
Well, it worked.

04:00.816 --> 04:02.817
Well, it's too expensive
a gift.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.954
- You're gonna have
to give it back.
- What?  Why?

04:05.988 --> 04:08.990
You shouldn't choose
your friends because
of the stuff they have.

04:09.024 --> 04:12.260
Now how would you like it
if people only liked you
because you had nice things?

04:12.294 --> 04:15.630
Why don't I keep this
and we'll test your theory?

04:15.664 --> 04:20.201
Gabe, if you won't
give it back, I will.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.855
Fine.
( chuckles )

04:23.889 --> 04:26.290
Fine, dad.
I don't need this thing.

04:26.325 --> 04:30.561
I have plenty
of other great games
to play with.

04:30.663 --> 04:33.498
Like this.
( chuckles )

04:34.700 --> 04:37.268

04:37.302 --> 04:39.637
You <i>disgust</i> me.

04:47.846 --> 04:49.681
Okay.

04:49.715 --> 04:51.516
- Shall we?
- Shall we what?

04:51.550 --> 04:53.484
Rehearse the song.

04:53.519 --> 04:55.953
- Oh!  Right.
- Yeah.

04:55.988 --> 04:58.256
Duh!  What else
would we do?  Airhead!

- Yeah!

Okay, only after
I say stuff.

Got it.

- What?  What is it?
- Come.

07:50.863 --> 07:54.565
Amy, I have
been teaching art
for many years,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.301
And I've always believed
that everybody

07:57.369 --> 08:01.405
Has artistic ability,
no matter how deeply buried.

08:02.841 --> 08:04.842
And then I met you.

08:08.013 --> 08:11.816
What?  You don't think
I have talent?

08:11.850 --> 08:14.485
Oh!  Your words,
not mine.

08:15.687 --> 08:18.589
Although if I were
to use words,

08:18.624 --> 08:20.958
I'd choose those.

08:20.993 --> 08:23.594
Well, uh, give me
another chance.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.764
What is that?!  Oh!

08:26.798 --> 08:28.466
It's glorious!

08:28.500 --> 08:31.736
What passion!
What vibrancy!

08:31.770 --> 08:35.106
Oh, amy,
you paint with a joy

08:35.140 --> 08:36.941
That's almost childlike.

- Well, actually--
- it's genius!

08:39.244 --> 08:40.912
Thank you.

08:42.481 --> 08:45.216

( whirring )

11:01.920 --> 11:03.754
You wanna join me?

11:04.823 --> 11:08.726
- ( whistle tweets )
- ( both laugh )

11:08.760 --> 11:11.295
Oh, this is awesome!

11:11.329 --> 11:14.065
Oh oh oh, bob,
what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

11:14.099 --> 11:15.766
Oh, I just
wanted to--

11:15.801 --> 11:18.169
Oh!  Here comes
the taco boat.

11:18.203 --> 11:20.204
Umm, I--

11:20.238 --> 11:23.040
I-I-- I just wanted
to say how happy I am

11:23.075 --> 11:26.377
That gabe and lucas
and you and me

11:26.411 --> 11:28.212
- Are best friends.
- Oh.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.327
- <i>( gabe sighs )</i>
- gabe, I thought it over,

11:44.996 --> 11:47.498
- And here.
- Y-you're gonna
let me keep it?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.066
Why'd you change
your mind?

11:49.101 --> 11:51.335
Because I'm not
an unreasonable man.

11:51.369 --> 11:53.938
In fact,
I'm so not unreasonable,

11:53.972 --> 11:56.140
I accepted one myself.

11:57.776 --> 12:00.044
Not-not-- not that
I'm complaining,

12:00.078 --> 12:03.280
But you're sending me
some mixed messages here.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.818
I like to think of them
as <i>flexible</i> messages.

12:10.322 --> 12:11.655
You saw the den,
didn't you?

12:11.690 --> 12:14.225
I had two trays of tacos.

12:14.259 --> 12:16.727
And we're gonna have
more this Sunday,

12:16.761 --> 12:19.163
Because we got
invited over to watch
the football game.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.832
Welcome to the dark side.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.201
We've been expecting you.

12:33.512 --> 12:36.147
Oh, spencer,
have you seen
skyler anywhere?

12:36.181 --> 12:38.249
Nope, but it's
almost time for me to win--

12:38.283 --> 12:42.386
I mean compete
in battle of the bands,

12:42.420 --> 12:44.421
- So I should get going.
- Right.

12:44.456 --> 12:45.890
Thanks for your help.
( chuckles )

12:45.924 --> 12:47.191
( mutters )
clump nugget.

12:48.693 --> 12:51.162
Oh, skyler, there you are.
I've been looking
all over for you.

12:51.196 --> 12:52.863
Oh, I was
in the photo booth.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.732
Yup yup,
I see that now.

12:54.766 --> 12:57.201
Come on, we have to
get going.  It's almost
time for us to go--

12:57.235 --> 12:59.937
Actually, I don't want
to do the contest anymore.

12:59.971 --> 13:02.907
- What?  Why not?
- Well, because...

13:02.941 --> 13:04.909
I don't want
to compete against
my boyfriend.

13:04.943 --> 13:07.311
Boyfriend?
Who's your boyfriend?

13:11.183 --> 13:14.185
No.  No.  No!

13:14.219 --> 13:16.387
Yes yes yes.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.270
And so you guys
are a couple?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.072
That's right,
p.J.'s my dude.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.641
- And skyler's my lady.
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.243
And teddy's gonna hurl.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.414
Wha-- so that's why
you don't want to do
battle of the bands?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.182
- Because you're a couple?
- That's right,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.918
'cause competing
against each other would not
be good for our relationship.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.020
- But what about our song?
- You can sing it.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.522
- But it's a duet.
- So?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.625
So I can't "du-et"
without you.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.894
- Hey, guys.
What's going on?
- Hey, man.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.630
I'll tell you what's going on.
P.J. And skyler are a couple

13:51.664 --> 13:53.799
And now they don't want
to do battle of the bands.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.901
What?  After all
our hard work?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.469
I even asked
my mom to come.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.238
Well, sorry
to disappoint her.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.772
Oh no, it's okay.
She said no.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.180
Come on.
Come on, charlie.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.149
- One painting for mama?
- I tired.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.519
Okay, come on, charlie.
Just one little painting

14:14.554 --> 14:15.988
And you can
go back to sleep.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.259
Hey, what's charlie
doing up?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
I just put her down
for a nap.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.129
Oh, well, I guess
she just got her second wind.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.797
I tired.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.200
Don't know where
that came from.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.168
( sighs )
all right.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.472
What's going on?
Why are you acting
crazier than usual?

14:33.506 --> 14:36.742
My art teacher came over
to tell me that I stink.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.211
Okay, I'm with you so far.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.180
Then she took one look
at charlie's painting

14:42.215 --> 14:43.582
And loved it, so--

14:43.616 --> 14:45.751
You took
the credit for it.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.687
Well, I made charlie,
so in a way, I made
that painting.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.357
Honey, by that logic,
I made that painting too.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.593
Really?  You carried
that painting around

14:54.627 --> 14:56.728
Inside of you
for nine months?

14:56.763 --> 14:59.197
- What?
- ( sighs )

15:00.333 --> 15:02.701
Bob, I just wanna be
the best at what I do.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.504
Honey, you are
the best

15:05.538 --> 15:07.239
At a lot of things.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.041
You're the best nurse.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.344
You're the best mommy.
You're the best wife.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.948
- Go on.
- ( chuckles ) okay.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.518
I'll tell you what--
why don't we put
charlie to bed

15:19.552 --> 15:21.019
And then you
and I can cuddle?

15:21.054 --> 15:24.222
Because you are
also the best at that.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.960
( baby voice )
I tired.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.072
¶ I can't keep
chasing you around ¶

15:40.106 --> 15:42.474
¶ all of this running is
just bringing me ¶

15:42.508 --> 15:44.276
¶ down ¶

15:44.310 --> 15:47.379

15:54.487 --> 15:59.091

15:59.125 --> 16:02.427
¶ got me feeling
hypnotized ¶

16:04.163 --> 16:06.465
¶ and, girl,
it makes me feel alive... ¶

16:06.566 --> 16:08.300
Well, would you look
at that--

16:08.334 --> 16:10.535
Our ex-boyfriend's
gonna win this thing.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.771
I don't care.
I have a new boyfriend.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.340
You could too.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.276
It just--
it makes me so mad.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.146
Because you two became
an annoying couple,
we can't compete.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.584
- Wait a minute.
- Ooh, I know that look.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.552
She's getting an idea.
I never get that look.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.355
Me neither!

16:30.390 --> 16:32.624
Both: Aww.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.599
Oh!  Man, I'm looking
forward to tonight.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.034
- Oh yeah, it should
be a good game.
- Game-shmame.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.203
There's a rumor
albert made fresh guacamole.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.139
The rumor... Is true.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.040
( laughs )

16:49.075 --> 16:51.877
Dad, I wanna
go home.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.712
What?
It's almost kick-off.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.714
We were playing
"witches versus warlocks 3"

16:55.748 --> 16:57.849
- And he said I cheated.
- Because you did cheat.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.918
I did not cheat.
I <i>beat</i> you.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.521
- Because you cheated!
- Take it easy, guys.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.122
- But, dad!
- Lucas.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.057
Come with me.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.095
Dad, I didn't cheat.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.997
- Really?
- Yes!

17:12.031 --> 17:14.266
Look, I've cheated before.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.435
I'm good at it.
If I had really cheated,

17:16.469 --> 17:18.136
He would <i>not</i>
have known about it.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.972
This is an insult
to my cheating

17:21.007 --> 17:23.508
- And I will
not stand for it!
- Okay okay, all right.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.676
I think I understand.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.612
( sighs )

17:27.646 --> 17:29.781
Couldn't you just
say you cheated?

17:31.951 --> 17:34.619
You want me to apologize
for something I didn't do?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.289
( sighs )

17:37.323 --> 17:39.191
Albert made
fresh guacamole.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.061
Bob, my boy's pretty upset.

17:43.095 --> 17:46.531
Now why don't you just
have gabe apologize to lucas,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.900
So that you and I can
enjoy the game?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.739
No, I believe
my boy, bruce.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.775
If he said
he didn't cheat,
he didn't cheat.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.078
- Thanks dad.
- Yeah, well,

18:00.112 --> 18:02.080
I think we should
get going.

18:02.114 --> 18:04.816
You know, bob, I admire
that you stood up
for your son.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.852
- So you want us
to stay?
- No.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.189
Keeping the mytab.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.032
All right!  Yeah!

18:21.067 --> 18:24.135
Okay, now our next band
is p.J. And the vibe,

18:24.170 --> 18:26.037
Plus teddy and skyler.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.279
Um, this is a song
about new love

18:34.313 --> 18:36.281
And how people find
each other,

18:36.315 --> 18:39.451
Even though it might
annoy someone's sister.

- I'm just really happy.
- Oh no, I'm cool with that.

20:51.183 --> 20:55.620
Hey, charlie,
you remember my old
boyfriend spencer, right?

20:55.655 --> 20:58.623
Totally stomped him
in battle of the bands!

21:01.293 --> 21:03.528
Did it feel good?  Yes.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.530
Yes, ma'am, it did.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.166

as good as being over

- At bruce and lucas's house.
- No, it's not.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.747
I know it's not.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.186
Sometimes I wonder
if recording moments like this

21:28.220 --> 21:31.256
Is just gonna scar you.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.158
I guess
we'll find out later.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.693
Good luck, charlie.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.392
Oh, this is the life.

Yup, nothing like it.
