WEBVTT

00:22.956 --> 00:25.524
(grunts loudly)

00:30.964 --> 00:33.132
There's, like, the
whole rest of the couch.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.768
This is the only cushion I like.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.836
You just moved in.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.338
How can you already have
a favorite cushion?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.140
The butt wants
what it wants.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.208
(crowd cheering over television)

00:45.979 --> 00:47.980
You're watching the Little
League World Series?

00:47.982 --> 00:49.982
You never even came to my games.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.150
I don't know these kids,

00:51.152 --> 00:53.619
so I won't be ashamed
when they screw up.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.892
You be nicer to your son, or
you won't get into Heaven.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.160
Heaven doesn't exist.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.663
It's just a lie to keep
morons from freaking out.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.066
You take back.
Is Heaven.
No Heaven.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.168
Is Heaven,
you    <i>diab </i>
<i>No Heaven.</i>

01:09.170 --> 01:10.235
<i>Diablo. </i>
<i>No Heaven.</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:11.236
<i>Diablo. </i>
<i>No Heaven!</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:13.005
(mouthing)

01:13.007 --> 01:14.006
ANNOUNCER:
Dropped by Simmons.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.175
And look at his dad.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.243
He wants to be
anywhere but here.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.511
You see?

01:19.513 --> 01:21.046
How do you know I was bad?

01:21.048 --> 01:22.514
You never even came to a game.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.249
Oh.

01:26.386 --> 01:27.586
I apologize.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.255
You're a natural.

01:33.359 --> 01:36.428
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:36.430 --> 01:38.530
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:38.532 --> 01:42.534
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:42.536 --> 01:44.536
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:44.538 --> 01:48.707
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:48.709 --> 01:53.212
¶ So many questions have I

01:53.214 --> 01:55.280
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:55.282 --> 01:57.950
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.222
Hey, gang.
Oh, hey, Dad.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.389
What are you doing here?

02:04.391 --> 02:06.258
I got a big meeting today.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.895
Warner, what if I told you
that I could corner

02:09.897 --> 02:13.699
the entire market
for penguin meat?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.742
Do-do-do people eat
penguin meat?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.878
Taste this.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.581
Nope.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.616
(laughs)

02:30.618 --> 02:31.750
Eli?

02:31.752 --> 02:33.318
Uh, no.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.754
I'm Jewish.

02:35.756 --> 02:39.158
It's free.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.597
Well, anyway.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.833
Keep your fingers crossed.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.602
With any luck, we'll be
firing up the slaughterhouse

02:50.604 --> 02:52.404
by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.908
I'll save you some "happy feet."

03:00.113 --> 03:02.114
My dad, the businessman.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.949
He keeps trying
because most people

03:03.951 --> 03:06.618
get their big break at 70.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.288
Guys, Golden Gate Games
is crushing us.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.489
They just announced
three new concepts

03:10.491 --> 03:12.124
and their stock is going
through the roof.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.027
I know. We both bought
500 shares last year.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.028
What?!

03:16.030 --> 03:17.162
Boom!

03:17.164 --> 03:19.464
Back that money truck up!
Okay!

03:19.466 --> 03:20.866
Back it up.
(beeping)

03:20.868 --> 03:22.301
Back it up.
Where do you want it?

03:22.303 --> 03:24.469
There's so much money.
(beeps)

03:24.471 --> 03:26.471
We need a game.
Oh, don't worry about it.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.473
This-this is the brain
that's given us games

03:28.475 --> 03:30.309
like <i>Tanks Versus Kittens.</i>

03:30.311 --> 03:32.311
<i>Satan in Outer Space.</i>

03:32.313 --> 03:36.315
<i>Knife Your Neighbor.</i>

03:36.317 --> 03:37.649
Well, that brain just handed me

03:37.651 --> 03:40.485
<i>Pierce Brosnan Presents:</i>
<i>Badminton.</i>

03:40.487 --> 03:43.355
Huh, that's all
you've come up with?
Hey, ow, ow, hey!

03:43.357 --> 03:45.324
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm trying!

03:45.326 --> 03:46.158
Let me see your eyes.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.492
What?
Eyes, eyes,

03:47.494 --> 03:48.627
eyes, eyes, eyes!

03:49.395 --> 03:51.496
Oh, my God.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.664
I knew it!

03:52.666 --> 03:53.932
You're not stoned.

03:56.836 --> 04:00.405
What, are you trying
to ruin this company?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.507
I... I don't need
to be on something

04:02.509 --> 04:04.076
to come up with a good idea.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.144
(Warner and Veronica laugh)

04:08.514 --> 04:10.415
Come here.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.253
(grunts)

04:14.255 --> 04:16.488
Eli, how long has
this been going on?

04:17.357 --> 04:19.258
Wh-What's going on?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.627
Eli, this is
a safe place.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.297
Wait, is this an intervention?

04:26.866 --> 04:30.269
It's whatever it needs to be
to get you back on drugs.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.041
I know you think not
getting high seems really cool

04:36.043 --> 04:37.209
and all that, blah-la-la-la-la.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.277
But it-it...

04:39.879 --> 04:41.713
But it's affecting
your friends, your family,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.548
and-and most importantly
your work.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.384
Eli, this company needs
a new game.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.219
It's not that bad.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.553
It's not that bad? It's not...?

04:48.555 --> 04:49.955
Yo, what is this, huh?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.390
What is that?
Is that a gym bag?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.557
You've been working out?

04:52.559 --> 04:54.059
Hey, don't touch my stuff, man!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.127
VERONICA:
Here!

04:55.129 --> 04:56.895
Why don't you touch
this stuff?

04:56.897 --> 04:59.064
Look, these are
special brownies from my clinic.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.066
Use them to come up
with a great game idea

05:01.068 --> 05:02.501
that I can put
into production.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.242
Okay.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.811
I'll get high tonight.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.324
I thought that was
your favorite cushion.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.994
I love all the cushions.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.144
Dad, did...

05:46.146 --> 05:47.779
did you eat this brownie?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.848
(laughs):
Yeah.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.856
(humming)

06:04.664 --> 06:06.965
Wow, you seem like
you're in a really good mood.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.300
Why shouldn't I be?

06:08.302 --> 06:11.036
I'm here
in this beautiful apartment.

06:11.038 --> 06:15.073
I blew my nose five minutes ago
and got everything.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.144
I have nothing
to complain about.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.812
Really? Um...

06:20.814 --> 06:22.814
okay, what about...

06:22.816 --> 06:24.049
President Obama?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.385
He's trying his best.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.223
Okay, um, you know, I was
at dinner earlier tonight,

06:31.225 --> 06:33.492
and there was a gay couple
sitting next to me.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.661
They were going at it
pretty good.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.232
Hey, love is where you find it.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.803
Even if it's at the top
of Brokeback Mountain.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.011
So, why...
why-why do you think

06:53.013 --> 06:55.247
you're so happy tonight?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.517
Well, I was
here by myself,

06:58.519 --> 07:02.354
yelling at Wolf Blitzer
like I always do...

07:02.356 --> 07:04.856
and I saw those brownies
in the refrigerator.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.892
And I don't
usually eat chocolate

07:06.894 --> 07:08.994
because it's for women.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.699
But then I thought,
"You know what, David?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.701
You deserve some pleasure."

07:16.703 --> 07:18.370
And it hit me.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.372
When I'm yelling
at Wolf Blitzer,

07:20.374 --> 07:21.573
I'm really yelling at...

07:21.575 --> 07:22.874
Yourself.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.543
No, Wolf Blitzer.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.445
I love myself.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.448
I love everybody.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.782
Even Mom?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.285
Nope.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.886
But I love you.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.221
You know that, right?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.290
Mwah!

07:45.231 --> 07:48.733
I... I love you, too, Dad.

07:48.735 --> 07:52.404
I'm sorry I don't
say it enough.

07:52.406 --> 07:55.807
Tr... trust me,
this will last a lifetime.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.783
What's wrong, honey?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.251
Oh, nothing.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.253
I'm just worried about
going under financially,

08:08.255 --> 08:10.288
and then having to sell
the house and then move in

08:10.290 --> 08:12.457
above an Ethiopian
restaurant.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.759
What is it this time?

08:14.761 --> 08:16.595
Well, you know, it's just

08:16.597 --> 08:19.264
Eli hasn't really had a good
idea since his dad moved in,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.766
and-and if we don't get a game
into production this week,

08:21.768 --> 08:24.436
then-then we're gonna
miss the holiday rush,

08:24.438 --> 08:27.272
and then have to end up
selling the house and...

08:27.274 --> 08:29.608
And Ethiopian restaurant,
right, okay.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.110
Um, listen.

08:32.112 --> 08:36.448
I think I can help you
relieve some of that stress.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.451
Oh, you mean... you
mean intercourse.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.119
Yeah, that might help.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.856
Yup, I'll just put both of
the phones in airplane mode.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.358
(both laughing)

08:47.460 --> 08:50.929
What are you doing?

08:52.331 --> 08:53.932
Oh, are you having sex?

08:55.301 --> 08:59.204
I can wait outside until
I hear Warner say, "Sorry."

09:00.172 --> 09:02.140
No, we're not having sex.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.209
Good, 'cause you know
what I always say

09:04.211 --> 09:05.977
about sex on a work night.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.146
The competition's
not having sex...

09:08.148 --> 09:10.815
CRAWFORD and WARNER: So you're
just screwing yourself.

09:10.817 --> 09:11.883
Yeah.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.654
So, what's our next big game?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.055
No idea.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.158
My dad ate one
of the brownies,

09:20.160 --> 09:23.228
and he was a delight.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.497
My dad did something
that required

09:25.499 --> 09:28.800
five toilet flushes at 4:12 a.m.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.170
Well, you know, there's
an easy solution.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.738
You can just give
him a brownie.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.173
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.575
Camila would...
Camila would kill me

09:36.577 --> 09:38.877
if she caught me
drugging my dad.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.179
Oh, I didn't realize
she was so anti-drug.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.349
Didn't she used to be the
"Bloody Nose Nightclub Queen"?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.185
Well, you know, we have kids now

09:47.187 --> 09:50.388
and so she's basically against
everything she used to love.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.357
So don't tell her.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.858
We don't keep secrets.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.860
We even have access to
each other's Internet history.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.630
That's how I know
she watches so much porno.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.937
The kids are asleep,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.040
No.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.443
Let me be your laptop tonight.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.878
Oh...

10:13.880 --> 10:15.246
I like it.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.582
Okay.
I'll be up in a minute.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.285
Fold my corner
of the blanket down.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.391
Uh, Dad?

10:26.393 --> 10:29.594
I'm going to sleep.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.663
Good night.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.235
There might be something left
on the counter for you.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.270
Warner?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.339
Aw.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.511
Hello.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.152
Mmm.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.488
WARNER:
(whoops) <i>Hey, now!</i>

11:05.931 --> 11:09.501
So, did the...
did the brownie work?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.771
Eight hours of sleep
and super-hot married sex

11:12.773 --> 11:14.272
with my wife.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.807
(laughs)

11:15.809 --> 11:18.276
She-she picked me up

11:18.278 --> 11:21.513
and did me
against the wall.

11:23.115 --> 11:26.818
She rubbed five of the seven
skin layers off my back.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.019
Wow.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.287
You know, I'm-I'm glad

11:29.289 --> 11:30.622
you're comfortable enough
around me

11:30.624 --> 11:32.290
to talk about
your rag doll-like participation

11:32.292 --> 11:34.459
in your wife's
sexual activities,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.628
but if we don't have a game
by Friday,

11:36.630 --> 11:38.329
we're gonna be screwed
for the holiday season.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.131
I don't have an idea,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.667
but I am two brownies away
from getting my dad

11:42.669 --> 11:44.736
to admit he loved my mom.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.472
Ooh. Well, when that happens,

11:47.474 --> 11:48.973
maybe you won't need to have

11:48.975 --> 11:51.142
action figures
on your desk anymore.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.178
I don't...

11:53.180 --> 11:54.646
I don't <i>need</i> them.

11:54.648 --> 11:55.680
Not...

11:55.682 --> 11:56.881
not Scooterman!

11:56.883 --> 11:58.717
Anybody but Scooterman!

12:06.158 --> 12:09.160
God, that feels so cool.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.895
(doorbell rings)

12:16.168 --> 12:17.702
Who are you?

12:17.704 --> 12:20.138
I don't know.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.577
DAVID:
Hey, Crawford!

12:25.579 --> 12:27.912
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

12:27.914 --> 12:31.416
Well, I had
a delicious brownie...

12:34.186 --> 12:37.856
...and then a little bird
led me here.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.191
So, how are you?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.860
I'm good.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.428
(plays chord)

12:44.530 --> 12:47.098
No, really, how are you?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.701
I'm sad.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.569
And I'm worried.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.874
What if it starts to
rain and never stops?

12:55.876 --> 12:57.208
(strums chords)

12:57.210 --> 12:59.744
Oh, no.
What are we gonna do?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.880
I'm gonna sing
you a song that I wrote

13:01.882 --> 13:04.449
that just might change
the world.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.720
¶ Noble Eskimo

13:08.722 --> 13:11.656
¶ We stole your snow

13:13.592 --> 13:16.427
¶ Noble Eskimo

13:16.429 --> 13:19.964
¶ We stole your snow

13:21.634 --> 13:25.069
¶ Our warming made
your igloo melt ¶

13:25.071 --> 13:30.141
¶ You're left
with just a walrus pelt ¶

13:31.577 --> 13:34.612
BOTH:
¶ Noble Eskimo

13:34.614 --> 13:36.748
¶ We stole your snow

13:36.750 --> 13:38.316
Nice.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.251
And...

13:40.253 --> 13:44.222
(harmonizing): ¶ Noble Eskimo,
we stole your snow ¶

13:45.257 --> 13:47.592
Yes, we did.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.462
¶ Our warming made
your igloo melt ¶

13:51.464 --> 13:55.133
¶ You're left
with just a walrus pelt ¶

13:55.135 --> 13:57.268
¶ Noble...

13:57.270 --> 13:58.469
Any ideas.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.339
There are...
there are no bad ideas

14:01.341 --> 14:03.641
at this point. Any ideas.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.511
I hate the way you hold
your coffee mug with two hands.

14:08.113 --> 14:11.683
I do, too. You look like a
commercial for a bone loss drug.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.787
Oh, hey, back for more?
(chuckles)

14:15.789 --> 14:17.622
No, honey, I'm-I'm not.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.959
I'm actually here for your dad
because he's upstairs at Eli's.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.460
Why's that?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.795
I-I don't know.

14:23.797 --> 14:26.164
I was stitching your pajamas
back together this morning,

14:26.166 --> 14:29.300
and he just walked
right out the door.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.469
He's been acting really weird
the last few days.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.537
(gasps)

14:32.539 --> 14:34.806
Do you think he had a stroke?
Oh...

14:34.808 --> 14:36.708
No, no, he's fine.
They've both been

14:36.710 --> 14:39.110
secretly drugging their
dads with pot brownies.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.850
You brought drugs
into our house?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.852
(chuckles)

14:47.854 --> 14:50.421
Yes, but...

14:56.495 --> 14:57.996
(clattering)

14:57.998 --> 15:00.999
And down he goes!

15:01.001 --> 15:03.835
Would you tackle me in a hallway
if we were married?

15:03.837 --> 15:05.837
It'd be hard to do
since I killed myself

15:05.839 --> 15:07.405
on our wedding night.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.582
You marijuana'd us?

15:19.518 --> 15:22.020
I'm gonna sue you.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.389
We are so sorry. I...

15:24.391 --> 15:27.025
We're just... we're under
a lot of pressure, and...

15:27.027 --> 15:28.860
you guys are...

15:28.862 --> 15:30.762
you're so
annoying. I...

15:32.197 --> 15:33.865
I'm-I'm sorry
we tricked you.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.366
You didn't trick us.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.169
Of course we knew
we were getting stoned.

15:39.872 --> 15:43.942
We grew up in the '60s,
you squares.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.379
Okay, well, you
guys are cut off.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.981
No more brownies.

15:50.950 --> 15:55.586
Fine. We'll find
our own doobies.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.222
Okay, how are you gonna
get your own doobies?

15:58.224 --> 15:59.757
(chuckles)

15:59.759 --> 16:04.395
I've got enough glaucoma
to glaze a donut.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.965
Okay, guys,
this is serious.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.900
W-We're afraid
that you guys are too old

16:08.902 --> 16:10.234
to handle the effects of pot,

16:10.236 --> 16:12.070
and if anything
were to happen to you,

16:12.072 --> 16:13.571
we'd never forgive ourselves.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.406
Can't handle the effects?

16:15.408 --> 16:18.443
I could pot you under
the table, sonny.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.746
Okay, Dad,
that's ridiculous.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.315
I got an idea.

16:24.317 --> 16:29.020
Crawford and I challenge
you two to a Pot Off.

16:31.590 --> 16:36.260
If you can handle more pot
than us, we'll stop.

16:36.262 --> 16:40.098
Okay, nobody's gonna
have a "Pot Off" here.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.934
No, we have to come up
with video game ideas.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.168
Come on.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.837
Okay, you're on.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.972
WARNER:
What?

16:47.974 --> 16:50.775
No, we-we have work to do.
Our backs are against the wall.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.677
Last I heard,
you liked that.

16:56.181 --> 17:00.685
No game, no home,
Ethiopian restaurant.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.153
Look, maybe we'll come up
with something

17:02.155 --> 17:03.321
that'll save the company.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.189
Two days ago,
you were begging me to do this.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.625
Yeah, I-I was begging <i>you, </i>
<i>not me.</i>

17:07.627 --> 17:09.694
Me go home to wife.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.364
Are you gonna let them win?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.632
Oh, forget it, Warner.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.568
I was always the cool one
in the family anyway.

17:19.004 --> 17:22.306
(mocking): "I was always the
cool one in the family anyway."

17:22.308 --> 17:24.876
I'll show you who's cool.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.045
Do you have a glass of milk?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.648
ELI:
Okay.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.183
Standard North American
Pot Off rules.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.052
If you vomit or
your eyes close

17:34.054 --> 17:35.653
for more than a
minute, you're out.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.489
And if you jump out the
window, automatic forfeit.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.991
Let the games begin.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.559
(chuckles):
Yeah.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.064
Mmm.
(chuckles)

17:48.067 --> 17:50.234
Oh, yeah. Okay.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.736
(chuckles)

17:51.738 --> 17:53.337
Mmm.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.339
(chuckles)

17:55.341 --> 17:57.408
I got to lie down.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.549
I need $2,000.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.586
I want to become a deejay.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.790
You have to give him the money.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.028
I understand
how to get people dancing

18:17.030 --> 18:20.598
and keep them dancing.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.569
He totally does!

18:24.571 --> 18:26.637
(grunts)

18:29.875 --> 18:31.709
CRAWFORD/DAVID/ELI:
¶ Noble Eskimo

18:31.711 --> 18:35.046
¶ We stole your snow

18:35.048 --> 18:39.717
¶ Noble Eskimo,
we stole your snow ¶

18:39.719 --> 18:41.219
I love this song.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.555
¶ Our warming made

18:44.557 --> 18:47.725
¶ You're left

¶ Noble Eskimo

18:49.729 --> 18:52.029
¶ We stole your snow

18:53.065 --> 18:56.400
¶ Noble Eskimo,

18:56.402 --> 18:58.569
(sputtering)

18:58.571 --> 19:02.073
¶ Our warming made

19:02.075 --> 19:04.308
¶ You're left
with just... ¶

19:06.278 --> 19:09.547
Warner?

19:10.582 --> 19:13.584
How long you gonna
stay in there?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.720
WARNER:
How long is time?

19:17.589 --> 19:19.323
(quietly):
Dude, get out of there.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.325
We're gonna lose this thing.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.768
What's it say?

19:30.770 --> 19:33.104
"I no longer
understand your ways.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.606
"P.S. I will lower
my defenses long enough

19:35.608 --> 19:38.910
for you to slide a pizza
under the east cushion."

19:39.978 --> 19:42.046
Sneak attack!

19:43.982 --> 19:46.450
(Warner laughs)

19:46.452 --> 19:49.520
Suck my cushions,
little man!

19:52.124 --> 19:54.625
Hello, 911?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.961
Hi.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.031
I think I might be dead.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.368
We're doing way
better than them.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.970
They're really messed up.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.338
I'm proud of us.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.540
Me, too.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.377
Hey, um...
can I ask you something?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.580
Did I love your mother, right?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.549
(exhales)

20:18.551 --> 20:20.184
Well, did you?

20:20.186 --> 20:25.022
I don't think I ever
really loved anyone, Eli.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.758
Until the day you were born.

20:30.662 --> 20:34.332
Thanks, Dad.
That... means... a lot.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.735
So does "plethora."

20:37.737 --> 20:40.204
Hey, you want to split
a pound of turkey?

20:40.206 --> 20:41.405
Oh, yeah.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.308
Oh!

20:46.511 --> 20:49.146
Don't!

20:55.520 --> 20:59.190
So, how was Camila?

20:59.192 --> 21:00.691
She's mad.

21:00.693 --> 21:04.362
She said I can't play
at your house anymore.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.931
(sighs)
Where's my game idea?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.600
Ah, I'm sorry. I just...
I don't have anything.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.535
Yeah, that's okay.
The important thing is...

21:11.537 --> 21:13.204
Oh!
Where's my game?!

21:13.206 --> 21:15.873
You're a modern-day secret agent
who travels back to ancient Rome

21:15.875 --> 21:17.375
to stop the assassination
of Julius Caesar!

21:17.377 --> 21:19.710
And you're not just
fighting conspiring forces,

21:19.712 --> 21:21.545
you're also battling gods
like Jupiter and Neptune!

21:21.547 --> 21:22.880
It's called <i>Save Caesar.</i>

21:22.882 --> 21:25.249
Oh.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.285
Great. I'll get to work
on it immediately.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.288
Fear: the new pot.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.458
Do you want to
get some lunch?
Oh, yeah.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.527
Let me just ask my wife.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.233
Yeah. Hi, honey.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.735
Uh, can I go to lunch with Eli?

21:44.737 --> 21:48.072
(chuckles):
Oh, okay. Okay, thanks.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.807
Yeah. No, I got to go home.
