05:41.497 --> 05:43.288
- That long?
- Yes.

05:43.457 --> 05:45.449
Actually, l was on my way
to the awards ceremony,

05:45.625 --> 05:48.246
and l thought l'd drop by
and thank you for the flowers.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.545
- And the card.
- You're welcome.

05:58.178 --> 06:00.503
''You must be very proud.''

06:00.680 --> 06:03.005
Why not ''l'm proud of you''?

06:03.224 --> 06:06.427
Why speculation
rather than declaration?

06:06.601 --> 06:08.641
- What?
- We both know there are no mistakes.

06:08.812 --> 06:11.563
There must have been some reason,
either conscious or subconscious,

06:11.731 --> 06:14.222
that you chose these words.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.683
Frasier,
l have a confession to make.

06:16.861 --> 06:19.398
- Ah.
- My assistant wrote the card.

06:19.571 --> 06:20.769
Oh.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.572
When l heard
you were getting an award,

06:22.741 --> 06:26.488
l asked her to send flowers
with a note of congratulations.

06:26.702 --> 06:29.157
l'm afraid you've been
over-analysing.

06:29.371 --> 06:31.328
l see.

06:32.165 --> 06:35.913
Then again, perhaps
in that order to your assistant,

06:36.085 --> 06:38.374
you subconsciously
communicated an emotion

06:38.546 --> 06:41.250
that you couldn't
or didn't want to acknowledge.

06:41.465 --> 06:43.956
Or perhaps your subconscious
assigned new meaning

06:44.134 --> 06:46.541
to the words to reflect
your own self-doubt.

06:46.761 --> 06:50.840
But all art is self-portraiture,
and that includes the written word.

06:51.056 --> 06:54.176
However, we can only view art
through the lens of our own psyches.

06:54.393 --> 06:55.887
Then there is no pure art.

How would you know?

l think l'll write the card myself.

so that you don't infer any meanings
that aren't actually there.

07:47.439 --> 07:48.637

07:48.856 --> 07:52.022
Oh, that l'm somehow dissatisfied
with my work, something like that.

isn't it enough just to be nominated?

11:17.746 --> 11:21.031
You tell me, Miss Three-Time-Loser.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.084
MAN:
To all my listeners...

11:27.712 --> 11:31.461
FRASlER: l know l should be happy,
but l feel so dissatisfied.

11:31.633 --> 11:34.123
Well, Frasier, it's no accident

11:34.302 --> 11:35.961
that you're going through this
on the day

11:36.136 --> 11:40.216
that you receive
your lifetime achievement award.

11:40.432 --> 11:44.096
Well, duh. l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l'm just acting out.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.851
Please, please. Continue, please.

11:49.523 --> 11:50.982
As you know,

11:51.191 --> 11:55.899
men in our society commonly
define themselves by their careers.

11:56.070 --> 11:57.943
Yes, l'll cop to that. Yeah.

11:58.113 --> 12:00.485
ln fact, there's nothing
l'm more proud of than my career.

12:00.657 --> 12:03.527
lt's because l love to help people.
l always have.

12:03.702 --> 12:04.864
Right. Refresh my memory.

12:05.078 --> 12:07.320
Wasn't it your mother
who first sparked

12:07.497 --> 12:09.288
your interest in psychiatry?

12:09.498 --> 12:13.163
Yes, it was.
l remember the exact day.

12:13.335 --> 12:16.122
l was 8.

12:16.296 --> 12:19.214
l had come home crying because one
of the older boys had thrown my copy

12:19.383 --> 12:21.209
<i>of The Fountainhead under a bus.</i>

12:22.135 --> 12:24.590
My mother explained to me

12:24.804 --> 12:27.341
it wasn't because he didn't like
the way l walked,

12:27.514 --> 12:30.634
or because
l wore an ascot to school.

12:30.809 --> 12:33.809
lt was because
he didn't like himself.

12:33.978 --> 12:37.643
And at that very moment,

12:37.815 --> 12:39.606
l became a student
of human behaviour.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.526
lt was as if someone had given me
an instruction manual

12:42.694 --> 12:45.101
explaining why people
acted the way they did.

12:45.321 --> 12:50.149
Not to mention a way to distance
yourself from painful emotions.

12:50.367 --> 12:51.992
Oh, totally.

12:52.161 --> 12:54.948
l took a lot of grief for that ascot.

12:55.622 --> 12:59.666
So you were drawn to psychiatry
not because you like to help people,

12:59.834 --> 13:01.707
but because you feared them.

13:03.170 --> 13:04.961
l feared them?

13:05.172 --> 13:07.460
Psychiatry gives you objectivity.

13:07.632 --> 13:10.205
Objectivity gives you
emotional distance.

13:10.426 --> 13:12.383
Distance makes you feel safe.

13:12.553 --> 13:14.961
Yes, yes, granted.
But what has that got to do with me?

13:15.180 --> 13:16.722
How's your practise?

13:16.890 --> 13:18.717
l don't have a practise.
l have a radio show.

13:18.892 --> 13:21.643
Distance. Any children?

13:21.853 --> 13:24.474
Yes, l have a wonderful son
with whom l'm very close.

13:24.689 --> 13:27.808
- You live with him?
- He lives in Boston.

13:28.025 --> 13:30.480
Distance. With your wife.

13:30.694 --> 13:33.481
My ex-wife. Yes, l know, distance.

13:33.697 --> 13:34.894
Wasn't she a psychiatrist?

13:35.114 --> 13:36.739
Yes, she happened
to be a good one too.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.277
That's a handy choice
for someone

13:38.450 --> 13:41.819
who'd rather share ideas
than emotions.

13:42.037 --> 13:44.243
Have you ever met Lilith?

13:44.915 --> 13:45.993
No.

13:46.207 --> 13:51.830
Well, she happens to be a very warm
and loving woman.

13:53.297 --> 13:56.795
Have you had any other meaningful
relationships since then?

13:57.008 --> 14:00.341
As a matter of fact, l--
Well, what is your point?

14:01.429 --> 14:05.805
My point is that at the age of 8, at 8,

14:05.974 --> 14:08.381
you began to use psychiatry

14:08.601 --> 14:11.009
as a way to deal with a world
that scared you to death.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.179
And this lifetime achievement award

14:13.355 --> 14:16.605
has made your realise
that your career is finite.

14:16.775 --> 14:23.394
And once it's gone, all you'll have left
is that frightened 8-year-old boy.

14:26.743 --> 14:28.450
Well...

14:31.079 --> 14:33.237
Would you like to hear my theory?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.412
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.829
l am not an 8-year-old.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.503
And you know something else?
You're not my mentor anymore.

14:47.468 --> 14:49.461
Roz, you gonna eat your quiche?

14:49.679 --> 14:50.758
Are you kidding?

14:50.930 --> 14:53.053
This would be like pulling
the ripcord on my thighs.

14:53.224 --> 14:56.177
lt's nothing but cheese
and butter and pastry--

14:56.393 --> 14:58.469
And bacon.
Are you sure you don't mind?

15:01.063 --> 15:02.143
l have good news.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.974
l just spoke to Frasier.
He's on his way.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.229
Oh, thank goodness.

15:05.401 --> 15:09.314
Oh, not that l'm not having
a good time with you, Niles.

15:09.529 --> 15:12.613
Dad, l know what you're doing.
You don't have to overcompensate.

15:12.782 --> 15:15.902
l'm not some green-eyed monster
burning with envy for Frasier.

15:16.077 --> 15:20.287
All right, but if you were,
l bet you'd be a great one.

15:22.957 --> 15:25.448
Daphne?
l haven't seen you in a while.

15:25.626 --> 15:27.287
How have you been? Are you okay?

15:28.712 --> 15:32.627
l'm better than okay.
l'm in love with a man who loves me.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.839
He showers me with attention.

15:35.010 --> 15:38.842
Every morning l wake up wondering
what treasures this day will bring.

15:39.013 --> 15:41.764
lt really is the happiest time
of my life.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.511
And how are you?

15:45.268 --> 15:47.096
Good.

15:48.062 --> 15:49.142
Really good.

15:51.524 --> 15:54.311
Could you pass me
Frasier's quiche?

15:59.865 --> 16:01.940
And the butter.

16:03.577 --> 16:04.904
Thank you.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.196
All right, l hate to be the one
to break it to you,

16:08.372 --> 16:10.364
but l'm afraid you've lost your touch.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.494
- Where's your DSM?
- There.

16:14.252 --> 16:17.952
Emotionally stunted 8-year-old,
my eye.

16:18.422 --> 16:20.995
Ah. Here's what l'm going through.

16:21.174 --> 16:22.717
Phase-of-life issue.

16:22.885 --> 16:26.383
''A problem associated
with a particular developmental phase

16:26.554 --> 16:29.305
or other life circumstances.''

16:29.515 --> 16:32.053
- Please, a mid-life crisis?
- lt's obvious, really.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.969
l'm surprised
it didn't occur to me sooner.

16:34.145 --> 16:36.896
lf someone had called with
this problem, l'd have diagnosed it.

16:37.105 --> 16:39.312
- Then what would you have done?
- Depends on the caller.

16:39.524 --> 16:41.315
All right.

16:41.985 --> 16:47.524
The caller is you.

16:51.576 --> 16:52.821
Fine.

16:53.786 --> 16:55.909
On line one,

16:56.080 --> 17:01.584
we have Frasier Crane
from Seattle.

17:04.253 --> 17:06.709
Hello, Dr. Crane.

17:06.881 --> 17:09.252
l love your show. l'm a big fan.

17:14.095 --> 17:18.803
l won't bore you with all the details
of my life because you know them.

17:20.226 --> 17:24.934
Suffice to say,
l'm a successful psychiatrist.

17:25.105 --> 17:27.477
My problem is that,

17:28.400 --> 17:31.068
in spite of the life l've built,

17:32.153 --> 17:34.110
l feel...

17:37.408 --> 17:39.234
...empty.

17:48.793 --> 17:52.160
Ah. Emptiness.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.542
The eternal void.

17:54.755 --> 17:56.795
lf l'm not mistaken,
it was John Keats who wrote--

17:57.008 --> 17:59.581
Stalling. Deal with the feelings.

18:00.844 --> 18:02.836
All right, fair enough.

18:03.012 --> 18:05.136
Perhaps, caller,
if we re-frame the issue, we can--

18:05.349 --> 18:08.597
Redefining the problem.
Deal with the feelings.

18:09.393 --> 18:11.266
Uh...

18:11.436 --> 18:13.346
Let's run down
the Beck Depression lnventory--

18:13.564 --> 18:15.355
Re-diagnosing.
You know what the problem is.

18:15.524 --> 18:17.848
- The caller feels empty. Go on.
- Okay.

18:19.318 --> 18:21.062
Last month,
in the New England Journal--

18:21.279 --> 18:23.022
- He's already read it.
- How do you know?

18:23.197 --> 18:27.146
The caller is Frasier Crane.
lf you did, he did.

18:28.201 --> 18:30.159
l can suggest certain
visualisation techniques--

18:30.328 --> 18:31.870
He knows them already.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.155
Look, if he knows all this,
then why is he calling?

18:34.331 --> 18:38.199
He told you.
Because he's empty. Keep going.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.088
Well, sometimes it helps
to write yourself a letter.

18:43.298 --> 18:45.623
He's already got himself
on the phone.

18:45.842 --> 18:48.130
But l don't know what he wants.

18:48.344 --> 18:52.127
Then why do you keep trying
to bury him in psychiatric exercises?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.803
Because that's all l have.

19:03.606 --> 19:06.062
l'm sorry, caller.

19:07.527 --> 19:09.768
l can't help you.

19:11.905 --> 19:13.566
Frasier's up next,
and he's not here yet.

19:13.741 --> 19:16.148
- What the hell am l gonna do?
- He'll be here in a minute.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.493
- Just go up there and stall.
- Stall?

19:19.663 --> 19:21.536
