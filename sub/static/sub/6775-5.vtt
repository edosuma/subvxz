HOME BOX OFFICE

01:19.500 --> 01:23.618
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.128
I REMEMBER IT ALL
VERY WELL LOOKING BACK

02:55.130 --> 02:57.428
IT WAS THE SUMMER
I TURNED 18

02:57.430 --> 02:59.796
WE LIVED IN A ONE-ROOM,
RUNDOWN SHACK

02:59.800 --> 03:02.360
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF NEW ORLEANS

03:02.360 --> 03:04.419
WE DIDN'T HAVE
MONEY FOR FOOD

03:04.430 --> 03:06.591
( female )
SO, I WANT YOU TO MEET THIS GUY
I'M GOING OUT WITH TONIGHT,

03:06.600 --> 03:08.329
OKAY ?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.360
HE'S KIND OF A DORK,
BUT IN A SWEET WAY.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.658
HE SEEMS REAL
AT LEAST.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.857
AND HE'S KINDA
RICH I THINK.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.952
KINDA.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.121
OF COURSE,
SO WAS KADEEM,

03:22.130 --> 03:24.826
AND THAT WAS A FUCKING WASTE
OF TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.157
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

03:31.160 --> 03:33.628
I KNEW YOU NEVER
LIKED KADEEM.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.622
SO, I'M GONNA BRING THIS GUY
HOME TO MEET YOU.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.427
AND THIS TIME,

03:38.430 --> 03:42.526
I SWEAR I WILL PAY ATTENTION
TO WHAT YOU THINK.

03:44.030 --> 03:48.558
BECAUSE I AM ONE FUCKING
HOT-SHIT BITCH

03:48.560 --> 03:50.858
AND HE'D BE
FUCKING LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.297
SHE LOOKED AT
OUR PITIFUL SHACK,
THEN SHE LOOKED AT ME

04:08.930 --> 04:10.557
OH...

04:10.560 --> 04:13.950
OH, DOES THAT FEEL GOOD.

04:20.630 --> 04:21.892
HEY, TITO !

04:21.900 --> 04:24.721
COME HANG
WITH ME, OKAY ?

04:25.630 --> 04:27.029
( meowing )

04:27.030 --> 04:30.158
THANK YOU.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.427
WHO'S MY LOVER ?

04:32.430 --> 04:33.920
YES.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.827
YES.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.889
AREN'T YOU GLAD
I RESCUED YOU ?

04:40.900 --> 04:43.118
YOU BETTER BE
FUCKING GLAD.

04:43.130 --> 04:45.655
COST ME 800 BUCKS
IN VET BILLS.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.298
AT A TIME
WHEN THINGS

04:47.300 --> 04:50.292
WERE PARTICULARLY TIGHT
FOR MOMMY, I MIGHT ADD.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.754
ONE GOOD THING
ABOUT THIS GUY TONIGHT,

04:54.760 --> 04:58.719
HE'S GOT A BIG FAT DICK
AND HE FUCKS LIKE A JACKHAMMER.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.024
THOSE NEVER LAST.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.425
LORD FORGIVE ME
FOR WHAT I DO

05:18.430 --> 05:21.149
BUT IF YOU WANT OUT,
IT'S UP TO YOU

05:21.160 --> 05:24.425
DON'T LET ME DOWN,
YOUR MOMMA'S GONNA HELP YOU
MOVE UPTOWN

05:34.160 --> 05:38.790
( choir singing )

05:56.660 --> 05:59.197
(singing )

06:09.560 --> 06:11.494
( singing continues )

06:16.800 --> 06:19.758
DAVID, I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU HERE.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.320
IT'S ALWAYS NICE WHEN SOMEONE
COMES BACK TO THE FOLD.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.820
OH, I'VE BEEN
GOING TO CHURCH.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.390
I WAS JUST GOING
TO A DIFFERENT CHURCH.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.095
REALLY,
WHICH ONE ?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.249
ST. STEPHEN'S ?

06:29.260 --> 06:30.420
IN THE PALISADES ?

06:30.430 --> 06:32.489
NO, ST. STEPHEN'S
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.948
WELL, I HOPE YOU ALWAYS
FEEL AS WELCOME HERE

06:36.960 --> 06:38.598
AS YOU DID THERE.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.249
THAN KS.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.750
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER
WAS A DEACON HERE

06:41.760 --> 06:43.296
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
REPLACED HIM.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.052
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR THIS CHURCH

06:45.060 --> 06:46.755
TO LISTEN TO
A YOUNGER VOICE.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.250
IF YOU'RE
AT ALL INTERESTED,

06:48.260 --> 06:50.023
I COULD SUBMIT YOUR NAME
TO THE BISHOP.

06:50.030 --> 06:52.396
ME ?
A DEACON ?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.356
DAVID,
TH'S WONDERFUL.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.328
YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE SO PROUD.

06:56.330 --> 06:59.219
WELL, SURE, I'D BE HONORED
TO BE CONSIDERED.

06:59.230 --> 07:02.256
RUTH, HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP ?

07:02.260 --> 07:04.148
I'M DOING OKAY,
FATHER.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.390
EACH DAY IT'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT EASIER.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.753
THAT'S WHAT
I LOVE HEARING.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.593
WOW, WHAT
A SMALL WORLD !

07:10.600 --> 07:12.192
DO YOU GO
TO THIS CHURCH ?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.827
I JUST JOINED,
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC,

07:13.830 --> 07:16.458
SO, I LIKE THE WHOLE
RITUAL PART OF IT.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.348
OOH, YOU SMELL GOOD,
WHAT IS THAT ?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.089
WHO ARE YOU ?

07:20.100 --> 07:23.922
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NEVER INTRODUCED MYSELF.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.727
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOREVER.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.358
I'M TRACY MONTROSE BLAIR.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.827
HI, I'M DAVID--

07:29.830 --> 07:31.491
FISHER, I KNOW,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.229
OKAY, WHY ?

07:33.230 --> 07:35.790
BECAUSE MY UNCLE WALT WAS BURIED
AT YOUR FUNERAL HOME.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.052
OLD GUY ?

07:38.060 --> 07:39.755
CANCER ?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.126
HAD A TATTOO OF
A ROULETTE WHEEL
ON HIS BACK ?

07:42.130 --> 07:43.495
OH, YES.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.127
I HAVE A TATTOO.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.223
A BUTTERFLY.

07:47.230 --> 07:51.291
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I'M NOT REALLY AVAILABLE.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.619
YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND ?

07:52.630 --> 07:54.154
YES.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.525
SERIOUS ?

07:55.530 --> 07:57.555
WE'RE ENGAGED.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.596
WELL...
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.296
MOST MEN YOUR AGE

08:02.300 --> 08:04.495
ARE SO COMMITMENT-FOBIC
IT'S PATHETIC.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.956
YES, MEN ARE PIGS.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.450
OR THEY'RE GAY.

08:07.460 --> 08:10.429
WELL, I'M CERTAINLY GLAD
TO FIND OUT YOU'RE NOT GAY.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.557
I HAVE TO GO,
MY MOTHER'S WAITING.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.297
( Tracy )
BYE BYE !

08:16.300 --> 08:18.052
SHE SEEMS NICE.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.790
SHE SEEMS NUTS.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.556
HELLO ?!

08:32.560 --> 08:35.950
( female )
OUT HERE !

08:38.230 --> 08:39.788
HEY.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.427
THIS IS
THE LIFE, HUH ?

08:41.430 --> 08:42.988
APPARENTLY.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.991
SO, HOW OFTEN DO
MOMMY AND DADDY GO AWAY ?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.422
OH, CONSTANTLY.

08:46.430 --> 08:47.897
THEY'RE VERY
IMPORTANT PEOPLE

08:47.900 --> 08:49.856
WITH VERY IMPORTANT
PLACES TO GO.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.125
LUCKY FOR THEM I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE TO GO.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.621
HOW ARE YOU ?

08:55.630 --> 08:56.892
I'M GOOD.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.026
IT'S CHILLY TODAY,
AREN'T YOU COLD ?

08:58.030 --> 08:59.019
NOPE.

09:02.030 --> 09:03.520
JESUS, IT'S LIKE
A HOT TUB IN HERE.

09:03.530 --> 09:05.589
MOMMY AND DADDY KEEP IT
THIS HOT ALL THE TIME.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.022
EVEN IN SUMMER.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.225
THEY'RE VERY WASTEFUL.

09:09.230 --> 09:12.393
AH, THAT'S JUST WRONG.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.623
( Nate )
OH, MAN, YOU ARE...

09:22.630 --> 09:24.427
WHAT ?

09:24.430 --> 09:27.797
YOU'RE UNLIKE ANY WOMAN
I'VE EVER MET.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.495
GOOD.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.694
YOU SCARE ME
A LITTLE.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.224
WHY ?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.699
I DON'T KNOW.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.793
IT'S JUST, UH...

09:47.800 --> 09:51.019
SO MUCH I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.622
ME?

09:53.630 --> 09:57.999
I AM AN OPEN BOOK.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.225
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BRINGING
YOUR FRIENDS HOME.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.027
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE THAT IN YEARS.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.793
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.290
YOU SAID YOU'D BE GONE
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.790
YES, IT'S SUNDAY.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.324
IT'S THE END
OF THE WEEKEND.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.493
NATE, THESE ARE
MY PARENTS,

10:26.500 --> 10:29.822
MARGARET AN D
BERNARD CH ENOWITH.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.298
MARGARET AND BERNARD,
THIS IS NATE FISHER,

10:32.300 --> 10:34.928
THE MAN I AM
HAVING SEX WITH.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.593
HELLO.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.854
BRENDA HAS TOLD US
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT YOU.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.852
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.418
I'M NOT SURE THERE'S
THAT MUCH TO TELL.

10:45.430 --> 10:46.897
OH, DON'T BE
SO MODEST.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.994
NATE'S STUDYING FOR HIS
FUNERAL DIRECTORS' LICENSE.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.798
WELL, NATE, YOU'LL HAVE TO
TELL US ALL ABOUT THAT.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.791
WILL YOU
STAY FOR LUNCH ?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.358
AT LEAST
A DRINK OR TWO ?

10:56.360 --> 10:58.248
I'D LIKE TO, BUT--

10:58.260 --> 11:01.593
I REALLY
HAVE TO STUDY.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.424
WELL THEN,

11:05.430 --> 11:08.490
YOU'LL HAVE TO JOIN US
FOR DINNER SOMETIME.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.649
AH...

11:09.660 --> 11:11.821
SOUNDS GREAT.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.021
( Nate )
GREAT !

11:20.200 --> 11:22.054
OKAY,
MRS. FISHER.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.528
I ASKED YOU HERE TODAY
SO WE COULD

11:24.530 --> 11:28.955
TALK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CLAIRE.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.757
I TOLD HER
IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.988
NO.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.753
CLAIRE FEELS THAT BEING
THE YOUNGEST CHILD,

11:34.760 --> 11:37.354
PERHAPS SHE MIGHT'VE
MISSED OUT

11:37.360 --> 11:39.828
ON A TIME WHEN
THE FAMILY WAS HAPPIER.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.923
NO, YOU SAID THAT,
I TOLD YOU,

11:41.930 --> 11:44.558
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A TIME
THIS FAMILY WAS EVER HAPPY.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.050
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.426
THERE WAS
LOTS OF HAPPINESS

11:48.430 --> 11:49.897
WHEN THE BOYS
WERE YOUNG.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.198
WHEN YOU WERE
YOUNG, CLAIRE.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.919
YOU WERE A VERY HAPPY
LITTLE GIRL, AND YOU KNOW IT.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.819
THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS TOO YOUNG
TO REALIZE WHAT FREAKS WE WERE.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.219
WHY WOULD YOU COME INTO
THIS MAN'S OFFICE

12:00.230 --> 12:01.891
AND TELL HIM
WE WERE NEVER HAPPY ?

12:01.900 --> 12:03.424
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE I GREW UP IN A HOUSE

12:03.430 --> 12:04.954
THAT WAS USUALLY FILLED
WITH TOTAL STRANGERS

12:04.960 --> 12:06.427
WHO WERE CRYING
ALL THE TIME ?

12:06.430 --> 12:07.920
OH, BOO HOO.

12:07.930 --> 12:10.819
I GREW UP
IN A TWO-ROOM APARTMENT
OVER A BARBER SHOP.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.651
AND I SPENT MY TEEN-AGE YEARS
TAKING CARE OF MY GRANDMOTHER

12:13.660 --> 12:15.799
AFTER ONE OF AND THEN BOTH
OF HER LEGS WERE AMPUTATED.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.949
LIFE'S HARD !

12:16.960 --> 12:18.154
MRS. FISHER--

12:18.160 --> 12:19.798
YOU HAD A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD,
YOU DIDN'T GO HUNGRY.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.051
SHE GETS UP
ON THIS CROSS,

12:21.060 --> 12:22.925
AND THEN THERE'S JUST
NO TALKING TO HER.

12:22.930 --> 12:24.989
YOU DID NOT HAVE TO GO
BEGGING FOR FOOD

12:25.000 --> 12:26.558
ON THE STREETS
OF CALCUTTA.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.323
BECAUSE I WASN'T DROPPED
IN A DUMPSTER SOMEWHERE,

12:28.330 --> 12:30.218
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
WANT THINGS TO BE BETTER ?

12:30.230 --> 12:32.448
THIS IS GOOD,
THIS IS GOOD

12:32.460 --> 12:34.394
FOR YOU TWO
TO TALK LIKE THIS.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.221
THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY
THINGS YOU NEED TO SAY.

12:37.230 --> 12:40.597
SO, WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
AND GET ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES ?

12:40.600 --> 12:42.795
I PREFER THE NOT
TALKING THING.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.223
I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY TO
HAVE MORE OF A DIALOGUE.

12:45.230 --> 12:48.688
MAKE TIME FOR IT,
SCHEDULE IT.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.225
REMEMBER, ANY
RELATIONSHIP IS WORK.

12:53.730 --> 12:56.255
OKAY, EXCELLENT SESSION.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.626
THAT'S IT ?

12:58.630 --> 13:00.689
THAT'S UP TO YOU,
ISN'T IT ?

13:03.300 --> 13:06.121
HE DOES THIS FOR LIKE
FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.095
SHE SHOULD LOOK
SPECTACULAR.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.523
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.454
WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT
SHE LOOKS HER BEST.

13:16.460 --> 13:20.191
SHE WAS THE REAL DEAL,
YOU KNOW ?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.452
SHE WAS A STAR.

13:22.460 --> 13:26.453
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
WE WILL GIVE HER A FUNERAL

13:26.460 --> 13:28.325
THAT BEFITS THE STAR
THAT SHE WAS

13:28.330 --> 13:30.150
AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.889
YOU KNOW
WHO SHE WAS ?

13:31.900 --> 13:33.219
ABSOLUTELY.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.596
AND I'M A BIG
FAN OF HERS.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.091
HEY, RICO.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.898
HOLY MOLY.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.391
FEEL THEM,
THEY'RE REALLY HARD.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.856
NO THANKS.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.225
LIKE A ROCK.

13:49.230 --> 13:51.926
SEE HOW THEY'RE
ALL COCKEYED ?

13:51.930 --> 13:54.592
THEY GOT THIS LOW-CUT
FLIMSY THING THEY WANT HER IN

13:54.600 --> 13:56.750
AND THEY SAID
ABSOLUTELY NO BRA.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.354
SHIT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK I'M GONNA DO.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.693
MAYBE I COULD LIKE,
TAPE 'EM TOGETHER SOMEHOW.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.395
YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS STUFF GOES ?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.425
I PUT IT IN THE WRONG PLACE
DAVID'LL BITCH AT ME FOR A WEEK.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.648
TOP LEFT, ABOVE
THE PURPLE STUFF.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.093
WELL, BOYS,

14:10.100 --> 14:13.251
THIS JUST MIGHT BE OUR
HIGHEST-PROFIT-MARGIN
FUNERAL THIS YEAR.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.420
SHE'S RICH, HUH ?

14:14.430 --> 14:15.897
THE GUY WHO'S
PAYING FOR IT IS.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.856
SHE LOOKS SO
FAMILIAR TO ME.

14:17.860 --> 14:18.827
SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.195
VIVECA ST. JOHN.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.760
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.455
THAT'S HER ?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.098
APPARENTLY SHE WAS
QUITE TALENTED.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.692
SHE WAS
A PORNO STAR.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.452
WHAT ?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.690
DAVID, SHE WAS HUGE, LIKE
BACK IN THE MID-TO-LATE 80$.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.452
OH, COME ON, YOU NEVER
SAW ANY OF HER VIDEOS ?

14:33.460 --> 14:34.893
NO, NATE,
I MISSED THOSE.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.595
THIS CHICK
FUCKED A SNAKE.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.852
THIS CHICK FUCKED LIKE
30 GUYS AT ONE TIME.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.623
I SAW THAT,
I SAW THAT !

14:40.630 --> 14:42.723
MY COUSIN RAMONE SHOWED ME
WHEN I WAS LIKE 12

14:42.730 --> 14:44.721
ON THE DIVING BOARD, OKAY ?

14:44.730 --> 14:46.152
THEY WERE LIKE
WRAPPED AROUND THE POOL.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.650
DID YOU SEE THE ONE
WHERE THE GUY'S

14:47.660 --> 14:49.218
RIDING THIS MOTORCYCLE
THAT SHE'S STRAPPED TO

14:49.230 --> 14:51.118
SO HE'S FUCKING HER WHEN
HE'S RIDING AROUND IN CIRCLES ?

14:51.130 --> 14:52.358
HOLY SHIT !

14:53.430 --> 14:55.921
COULD I SPEAK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE ?

15:04.460 --> 15:05.950
DAMNIT, NATE.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.724
THE WOMAN ON THAT TABLE IS
JUST AS DESERVING OF DIGNITY

15:08.730 --> 15:10.459
AS ANYONE ELSE
WE PREPARE.

15:10.460 --> 15:13.099
AND FEDERICO
IS AN EMPLOYEE.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.295
IT'S UP TO YOU AND ME TO SET
AN EXAMPLE FOR HIM, ALRIGHT ?

15:15.300 --> 15:17.598
ALRIGHT, I'M SORRY.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.851
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.249
THESE ARE HUMAN LIVES
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.557
THESE ARE NOT
ORGANIC BLACKBERRIES

15:22.560 --> 15:24.050
OR GRANOLA IN BULK.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.618
I SAID I'M SORRY.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.029
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SORRY.

15:27.030 --> 15:29.419
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT
WHAT WE DO HERE IS SERIOUS.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.988
BECAUSE IT REALLY
SUCKS FOR ME

15:31.000 --> 15:32.922
ALWAYS HAVING TO BE
THE SPOILSPORT.

15:32.930 --> 15:34.056
OKAY.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.051
THANK YOU.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.792
( phone )

15:43.600 --> 15:45.090
HELLO ?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.897
Nate, Bernard Chenowith.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.197
HI.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.724
MARGARET AND I WERE
WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

15:49.730 --> 15:51.823
JOIN US FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.991
TELL HIM WE'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.490
YOU HEAR THAT ?

15:55.500 --> 15:58.151
Actually I have a lot of
studying to do for this exam--

15:58.160 --> 15:59.821
NATE...

15:59.830 --> 16:03.095
WE'D REALLY LOVE TO BE ABLE TO
GET A SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE

16:03.100 --> 16:05.625
and I'm sure you're curious
about us as well, right ?

16:05.630 --> 16:07.222
Good.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.152
SHALL WE SAY
SEVEN-ISH ?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.196
CAN I BRING
ANYTHING ?

16:12.860 --> 16:14.293
HELLO ?

16:15.660 --> 16:18.549
( loud video game noises )

16:23.360 --> 16:25.328
SUCK ON THAT,
YOU UGLY FUCK.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.024
HI.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.657
THERE'S THIS THING
CALLED KNOCKING.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.220
IT'S LIKE PROTECTED
IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.027
I RENTED
SOME VIDEOS.

16:41.030 --> 16:44.454
I THOUGHT YOU AND I COULD
WATCH THEM TONIGHT.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.129
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

16:48.130 --> 16:50.223
YOU AND I USED TO GO TO
THE MOVIES EVERY MONDAY NIGHT ?

16:50.230 --> 16:52.858
REMEMBER HOW MUCH
FUN WE HAD ?

16:52.860 --> 16:56.193
I REMEMBER SEEING A LOT
OF REALLY BAD MOVIES.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.449
WHAT'D YOU GET ?

17:01.460 --> 17:03.690
"RU NAWAY BRIDE"

17:03.700 --> 17:06.498
AND "THE NUTTY PROFESSOR".

17:10.200 --> 17:11.622
COOL.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.899
02 didn't make
you a bitch.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.460
You were born one.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.951
( laughing )

17:26.300 --> 17:28.291
IT'D BE GOOD
FOR BUSINESS TOO.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.790
DAD WAS
A DEACON THERE.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.292
IT'S A BIG CONGREGATION,
PEOPLE DIE.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.621
THEIR FAMILIES DON'T
KNOW WHERE TO GO

17:35.630 --> 17:37.120
AND THE CHURCH
SENDS THEM OUR WAY.

17:37.130 --> 17:38.688
THEY KNOW
YOU'RE GAY ?

17:38.700 --> 17:42.056
I THINK FATHER JACK
HAS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.995
YOU THINK
HE LIKES YOU ?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.399
KEITH.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.220
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE GOING TO CHURCH
WITH ME ANYMORE ?

17:52.660 --> 17:54.218
WELL, IF THEY
MAKE ME A DEACON,

17:54.230 --> 17:56.755
I'D HAVE TO GO THERE
ALL THE TIME, YEAH.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.654
I'M SORRY,
I KNOW,

18:01.660 --> 18:04.891
SUNDAYS HAVE SORT OF
BEEN OUR DAY.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.991
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.059
I REALLY DO.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.721
ONE OF THE THINGS
I LOVE ABOUT YOU

18:13.730 --> 18:17.291
IS THE FACT THAT YOUR RELIGION
MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.518
BESIDES I THINK IT COULD BE
KIND OF HOT, YOU KNOW ?

18:19.530 --> 18:22.055
DATING A MAN
OF THE CLOTH ?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.818
BUT I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.593
WHAT IS IT, MY SON ?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.899
YOU KNOW THE GAY FIREMEN
AND POLICE OFFICERS CLUB

18:33.900 --> 18:35.128
I BELONG TO ?

18:35.130 --> 18:37.394
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
IN LAGUNA THIS WEEKEND.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.288
I WANT YOU
TO BE MY DATE.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.291
YOUR DATE,
WILL I GET A CORSAGE ?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.996
I WANT YOU TO START MEETING
SOME OF MY FRIENDS, DAVID.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.855
I'D LIKE THAT.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.727
OH.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.027
FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.954
FOR I AM
ABOUT TO SIN.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.321
(flatulating on tv)

19:03.400 --> 19:06.255
( laughing )

19:09.800 --> 19:12.553
THIS IS AN ENTIRE MOVIE
ABOUT EXPELLING GAS.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.324
I THINK THAT'S
WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.453
I DON'T WANT
TO WATCH THIS.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.394
GOOD, 'CAUSE
NEITHER DO I.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.150
CLAIRE, LOOK...

19:34.500 --> 19:37.025
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
THINK I'M OLD AND STUPID.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.089
NO, MOM, I DON'T.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.694
BUT I LOVE YOU JUST
AS MUCH AS I EVER DID.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.497
AND I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU

19:43.500 --> 19:45.229
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HELP.

19:45.230 --> 19:46.925
I DON'T NEED HELP.

19:46.930 --> 19:49.251
WHY IS EVERYONE ACTING LIKE
I'M IN THE TRENCHCOAT MAFIA ?

19:49.260 --> 19:51.023
YOU STOLE A FOOT.

19:51.030 --> 19:52.258
A HUMAN FOOT !

19:52.260 --> 19:54.319
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY ?

19:54.330 --> 19:56.924
BECAUSE SOME GUY
WHO TOTALLY SCAMMED ME
INTO HAVING SEX WITH HIM

19:56.930 --> 19:59.296
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
HE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT ME,

19:59.300 --> 20:01.621
HE TOLD THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
THAT I SUCKED HIS TOES.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.291
AND THEN WHEN I
CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT,

20:03.300 --> 20:04.995
HE SHOWED
ENTIRELY NO REMORSE.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.558
SO, I SAW NATE DROP
THE FOOT ON THE FLOOR

20:06.560 --> 20:08.994
I JUST GRABBED IT, JUST TO GET
BACK AT THAT ASSHOLE, OKAY ?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.218
IT WASN'T PREMEDITATED,
I'M NOT JEFFREY DAHMER.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.448
I DON'T GET OFF ON
HACKED-UP BODY PARTS.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.893
YOU'RE HAVING SEX ?

20:14.900 --> 20:16.697
NO.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.156
JESUS.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.128
NO, I'M SORRY, I CANNOT HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

20:20.130 --> 20:21.757
AND I'M REALLY SORRY,

20:21.760 --> 20:23.296
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER
GONNA HAVE ONE OF THESE

20:23.300 --> 20:25.154
LIKE TOUCHY-FEELY
MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIPS

20:25.160 --> 20:27.094
LIKE YOU SEE ON TV
AND IN THE MOVIES

20:27.100 --> 20:29.523
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
THEY DON'T EXIST !

20:36.000 --> 20:39.026
AH, HERE'S OUR GUEST,

20:39.030 --> 20:42.659
AND HE BROUGHT US A BOTTLE OF
LOUIS JADOT PINOT NOIR.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.652
1997, NO LESS.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.991
OKAY,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.956
A MAN WHO
KNOWS HIS WINE.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.019
I'M LIKING YOU
MORE AND MORE, NATE.

20:51.030 --> 20:54.124
WELL, I WORKED AT A FOOD CO-OP
IN SEATTLE FOR A LONG TIME.

20:54.130 --> 20:55.825
LEARNED A LITTLE BIT.

20:55.830 --> 20:58.856
A CO-OP, SO THERE'S A LITTLE
HIPPY IN THERE, HUH ?

20:58.860 --> 21:00.157
THAT MAKES SENSE.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.025
BRENDA WOULD FIND
THAT ATTRACTIVE.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.124
SHE LIKES TO THINK OF
HERSELF AS BEING WILDLY
COUNTER-CULTURAL.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.019
I THINK SHE'S ACTUALLY
JUST JEALOUS OF THE FACT

21:08.030 --> 21:10.828
THAT BERN AND I REALLY
WERE HIPPIES...

21:10.830 --> 21:11.899
BRIEFLY.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.253
CAN I OFFER
YOU A DRINK ?

21:13.260 --> 21:15.023
SURE, DO YOU HAVE
ANY BEER ?

21:15.030 --> 21:19.228
NO, WE HAVE VODKA,
SCOTCH, BOURBON.

21:19.230 --> 21:20.993
I'LL HAVE
A LITTLE BOURBON.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.524
MAN LY, BUT NOT
ELITIST.

21:22.530 --> 21:24.225
JUST HER TYPE.

21:24.230 --> 21:25.959
DOWN, GIRL.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.649
SO, WHERE IS BRENDA ?

21:29.660 --> 21:31.924
BRENDA.

21:31.930 --> 21:34.057
OH, BRENDA'S NOT
COMING TONIGHT.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.056
REALLY ?

21:39.060 --> 21:42.257
WELL, SHE FELT, AND I REALLY
HAVE TO AGREE WITH HER

21:42.260 --> 21:44.251
THAT WE'D HAVE A MUCH
BETTER CHANCE

21:44.260 --> 21:47.252
OF GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
IF SHE WEREN'T HERE.

21:47.260 --> 21:50.798
SHE DOES TEND TO TAKE
CENTER STAGE, SO TO SPEAK.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.125
HUH.

21:53.330 --> 21:56.527
I KIND OF WISH SOMEBODY THOUGHT
TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS.

21:56.530 --> 21:58.919
I'M SORRY,
I ASSUMED SHE DID.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.855
THERE YOU ARE.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.327
( male )
DAVID WAS RAISED
IN THIS CHURCH.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.957
HE WAS CHRISTENED
AND CONFIRMED HERE.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.518
HE SERVED AS
AN ALTER BOY.

22:14.530 --> 22:18.318
AND HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE
YOUTH MINISTRY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.753
HOW OLD ARE YOU,
DAVID ?

22:20.760 --> 22:22.091
I'M 31.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.728
WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING ?

22:24.730 --> 22:26.789
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.097
AH...

22:28.100 --> 22:30.250
HIS FATHER SERVED AS
A DEACON FOR OVER A DECADE.

22:30.260 --> 22:32.751
HE JUST RECENTLY
PASSED AWAY.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.423
SO, YOU SEE THIS AS A SORT OF
PASSING THE TORCH.

22:36.430 --> 22:40.298
NO, SIR, I SEE IT AS
A CHANCE TO SERVE GOD.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.124
WELL,

22:42.130 --> 22:43.791
I'M GLAD TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.654
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT IT IS.

22:45.660 --> 22:49.653
BEING A DEACON IS MORE
THAN JUST HAVING ACCESS

22:49.660 --> 22:51.093
TO THE CHURCH
MAILING LIST

22:51.100 --> 22:54.194
AND PASSING OUT YOUR
BUSINESS CARDS AFTER MASS.

22:55.860 --> 22:59.853
SIR, I WON'T DENY THAT I RUN
A BUSINESS PROVIDING SERVICE

22:59.860 --> 23:01.691
TO PEOPLE IN
TIMES OF NEED.

23:01.700 --> 23:05.158
BUT I WOULD NEVER EXPLOIT
MY RELATIONSHIP TO THE CHURCH

23:05.160 --> 23:07.196
FOR MARKETING PURPOSES.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.454
FRANKLY, I WOULD CONSIDER THAT
TO BE A PRETTY GRAVE SIN.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.951
NO PUN INTENDED.

23:14.530 --> 23:16.521
ST. BARTHOLOMEW
IS AN OLD CHURCH,

23:16.530 --> 23:19.351
A CONSERVATIVE CHURCH.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.193
CHURCH THAT DOESN'T NEED
TO HAVE ITS BOAT ROCKED.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.499
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY I FEEL
DAVID IS A GOOD CANDIDATE.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.389
HOW MANY MEN HIS AGE HAVE
VALUES AS STRONG AS HIS ?

23:28.400 --> 23:31.153
I THINK HE WOULD BE
AN EXCELLENT ROLE MODEL.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.091
ARE YOU MARRIED ?

23:34.100 --> 23:37.820
NO, SIR, I WAS
ENGAGED, BRIEFLY.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.658
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D
LIKE TO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

23:45.660 --> 23:47.924
BEFORE I CONSIDER THIS ?

23:47.930 --> 23:49.921
NO, SIR.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.393
IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT
ME THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ASK ?

23:55.400 --> 23:56.958
NO.

24:00.830 --> 24:04.948
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
MY DECISION IN A FEW DAYS.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.829
YOU IMPRESSED HIM.

24:10.830 --> 24:12.297
YOU THINK ?

24:12.300 --> 24:13.528
YES.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.919
OH, BY THE WAY,
ONE OF OUR PARISHIONERS

24:15.930 --> 24:17.625
RECENTLY LOST HER FATHER
TO LIVER CANCER,

24:17.630 --> 24:18.824
SHARON MURDOCH.

24:18.830 --> 24:21.253
I GAVE HER YOUR NAME,
YOU MAY BE GETTING A CALL.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.023
THANK YOU.

24:26.530 --> 24:28.794
AGAIN WITH
THE NOT KNOCKING.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.950
PACK SOME THINGS,
WE'RE GOING TO SAN BERNARDINO.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.120
WHAT ?

24:32.130 --> 24:33.654
WE'RE SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT MY COUSIN HANNAH'S.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.049
MOM, I'M DOING
HOMEWORK.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.755
WELL, STOP.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.297
I HAVE SCHOOL
TOMORROW.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.928
I'LL WRITE A NOTE !

24:42.930 --> 24:44.227
( door slamming )

24:45.630 --> 24:47.951
( Margaret)
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
SUCH A LONG TIME

24:47.960 --> 24:50.520
SINCE BRENDA'S WANTED US TO MEET
ANY OF THE MEN IN HER LIFE.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.794
( Bernard )
WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE,
CHIROPRACT OR ?

24:52.800 --> 24:54.290
HE WAS A ROLFER.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.927
HE WAS AN IDIOT.

24:55.930 --> 24:57.727
WELL, TO BE
PERFECT LY HONEST,

24:57.730 --> 24:59.823
I'M NOT SURE BRENDA EVER
MEANT FOR US TO MEET.

24:59.830 --> 25:00.956
I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY
EXPECTED YOU GUYS

25:00.960 --> 25:02.097
TO COME HOME
THAT DAY.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.624
OH, NATE.

25:03.630 --> 25:06.724
WHERE BRENDA'S CONCERNED,
THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.394
YOU THINK SHE
PLANNED ALL THIS ?

25:10.400 --> 25:11.856
OF COURSE.

25:11.860 --> 25:14.499
SHE'S A MASTER
MANIPULATOR.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.728
I MEAN,
I LOVE HER DEARLY,

25:15.730 --> 25:18.324
BUT YOU REALLY OUGHT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

25:18.330 --> 25:19.957
NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE
ANOTHER BOURBON ?

25:19.960 --> 25:22.690
NO THANKS.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.929
CAN I ASK YOU
GUYS SOMETHING ?

25:27.930 --> 25:30.524
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
INVOLVE ASKING US FOR MONEY.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.691
NO, IT DOESN'T.

25:34.700 --> 25:38.124
DOES THE NAME "NATHANIEL"
HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU ?

25:42.530 --> 25:43.952
WELL, SURE.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.554
NATHANIEL AND ISABEL.

25:52.930 --> 25:56.024
BRENDA ADORED THESE BOOKS
AS A LITTLE GIRL.

25:56.030 --> 25:57.998
SHE COULD READ BY THE TIME
SHE WAS THREE.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.719
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT ?

26:00.730 --> 26:03.051
TWO ORPHANS WHO
HAD ADVENTURES.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.597
THEY RAN AWAY
FROM AN ORPHANAGE,

26:05.600 --> 26:09.092
THERE WAS A MALEVOLENT NURSE WHO
WAS ALWAYS HUNTING THEM DOWN.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.489
BUT THEY ALWAYS MANAGED
TO OUTSMART HER.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.594
TYPICAL INFANTILE
WISH FULFILLMENT.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.726
HMM, I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF 'EM.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.550
THEY'RE BRITISH,
QUITE DARK.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.391
PEOPLE DIE IN THEM
ALL THE TIME.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.356
WHEN BRENDA'S BROTHER
WAS BORN,

26:24.360 --> 26:26.920
WE EXPECTED SERIOUS
DISPLACEMENT ANXIETY FROM HER,

26:26.930 --> 26:28.397
BUT THERE WAS NONE.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.753
SHE WOULD SIT
NEXT TO HIS CRIB

26:29.760 --> 26:31.955
AND READ HIM THESE
STORIES FOR HOURS.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.053
SHE WAS WHAT,
THEN, VERN, FOUR ?

26:34.060 --> 26:35.755
FIVE AT MOST.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.194
IT'S ALL
IN THE BOOK.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.022
THIS BOOK ?

26:44.500 --> 26:48.197
YOU MEAN, SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THAT EITHER ?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.326
I feel terrible.

26:54.330 --> 26:56.855
I'm sorry I snapped
at Grandma.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.623
Yeah, huh ?

26:58.630 --> 27:01.121
that was a pretty
"Frealq Friday" moment
we had back there.

27:01.130 --> 27:02.654
( laughing )

27:05.460 --> 27:07.792
RUTHIE, I AM SO
GLAD YOU CALLED.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.553
GINNIE AND I WOULD NEVER ALLOW
OURSELVES THIS KIND OF FOOD

27:10.560 --> 27:12.892
UNLESS IT WERE A REALLY
SPECIAL OCCASION.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.255
WE ARE DEFINITELY
GONNA HAVE TO DO

27:15.260 --> 27:16.921
AN EXTRA SPINNING CLASS
THIS WEEK.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.249
TOMORROW MORNING ?

27:18.260 --> 27:19.591
WHO'S TEACHING ?

27:19.600 --> 27:20.624
DEREK.

27:20.630 --> 27:22.291
OOH, I'M SO THERE.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.326
MOM AND I HAVE
THE HUGEST CRUSH

27:25.330 --> 27:26.991
ON THIS SPINNING
INSTRUCTOR AT THE Y.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.254
HE IS HOT, HOT, HOT.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.149
SO...

27:33.160 --> 27:35.025
CLAIRE, HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT COLLEGE ?

27:35.030 --> 27:36.588
YEAH.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.422
I'D LOVE TO GO TO LIKE
NYU OR COLUMBIA, BUT,

27:40.430 --> 27:42.898
I DON'T KNOW IF
I COULD EVER GET IN.

27:42.900 --> 27:46.358
WELL, THERE ARE SOME
GREAT SCHOOLS IN LA.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.420
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
TO SCHOOL IN THE SAME TOWN

27:49.430 --> 27:50.897
YOU GREW UP IN ?

27:50.900 --> 27:53.653
I GO TO CAL STATE
RIGHT HERE IN SAN BERDOO.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.299
WELL, WHATEVER
ROCKS YOUR BOAT.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.927
CLAIRE.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.693
HEY.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.849
I LOVE IT.

28:00.860 --> 28:02.293
BY LIVING AT HOME,

28:02.300 --> 28:03.756
I'M SAVING A TON OF MONEY
FOR GRAD SCHOOL.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.352
I'M NOT STUCK
IN SOME CRAPPY DORM

28:05.360 --> 28:07.248
WHERE EVERYONE'S
SMOKING POT

28:07.260 --> 28:09.023
AND PLAYING LOUD MUSIC
ALL THE TIME.

28:09.030 --> 28:12.056
AND I DON'T HAVE TO
CALL CAMPUS POLICE

28:12.060 --> 28:14.051
EVERY TIME I WANT TO
WALK HOME FROM THE LIBRARY

28:14.060 --> 28:16.153
SO THAT
I DON'T GET RAPED.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.191
AND I LIKE TO STAY
CLOSE TO MY MOM.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.350
THAT TRANSLATES INTO
I GET TO DO HER LAUNDRY.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.851
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.454
I LOVE MY MOM
AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT.

28:26.460 --> 28:28.792
THANK YOU, HONEY,
I LOVE YOU TOO.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.423
OKAY, ANYBODY
WANT MORE ?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.289
SO, HOW WAS IT ?

28:47.300 --> 28:49.052
OH, IT WAS QUITE
IN FORMATIVE.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.096
I KNOW WHAT NATHANIEL
MEANS NOW.

28:51.100 --> 28:53.193
I KNOW YOU HAVE
AN IQ OF 185.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.088
I KNOW YOU HAD A BOOK
WRITTEN ABOUT YOU.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.193
HERE, I SIGNED IT
FOR YOU.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.595
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME ABOUT THIS ?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.398
PEOPLE ALWAYS CHANGE TOWARD ME
AFTER THEY READ IT.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.493
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
THE FUN PART LAST.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.354
OH, GOD !

29:07.360 --> 29:09.089
SO, YOU'RE KIND OF
SCARILY BRILLIANT,

29:09.100 --> 29:10.499
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.151
WHAT I CAN'T HANDLE IS THE WAY
YOU KEEP MIND-FUCKING ME

29:13.160 --> 29:14.525
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL
ENTERTAINMENT.

29:14.530 --> 29:16.452
AND IT'S REALLY
STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.849
WELL, I'M SORRY I'M NOT SOME
WELL-BEHAVED LITTLE NOTHING

29:18.860 --> 29:20.191
THAT NEVER
CHALLENGES YOU,

29:20.200 --> 29:21.599
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

29:21.600 --> 29:23.227
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

29:23.230 --> 29:26.324
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE TRYING
TO DRIVE ME AWAY ?

29:26.330 --> 29:29.652
YEAH, NATE, I'M TRYING
TO DRIVE YOU AWAY.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.651
IT WAS MY MOTHER'S IDEA
THAT I NOT BE THERE.

29:38.660 --> 29:42.152
WHICH IS FINE BY ME, I DON'T
REALLY ENJOY THEIR COMPANY.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.152
SHE SAID IT
WAS YOUR IDEA.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.856
YEAH, SHE WOULD.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.590
SHE PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT,
SHE'S OUT OF HER FUCKING MIND.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.194
YOU COULD'VE WARNED ME
WHAT I WAS WALKING INTO.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.259
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GONE.

29:55.260 --> 29:58.593
I JUST WANTED TO

29:58.600 --> 30:00.124
GET IT ALL
OUT OF THE WAY.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.894
THEM, THE BOOK,
EVERYTHING.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.391
YEAH, WELL, I FELT LIKE
A FUCKING LAB RAT OVER THERE !

30:05.400 --> 30:07.391
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT THEY DO !

30:08.960 --> 30:11.258
I'M SIX YEARS OLD,
I SCORE THROUGH THE ROOF

30:11.260 --> 30:14.650
ON SOME STANDARDIZED,
CULTURALLY BIASED TEST

30:14.660 --> 30:16.753
AND IT ALL BECOMES
ABOUT THEM !

30:16.760 --> 30:19.456
THEY HAND ME OVER
TO STRANGERS, EXPERTS,

30:19.460 --> 30:21.257
A BUNCH OF
ACADEMIC FUCKS

30:21.260 --> 30:24.457
WHO SCRUTINIZED EVERYTHING
I DID OR SAID, OR THOUGHT, EVEN.

30:24.460 --> 30:27.156
IT IS A FUCKING
LAW OF PHYSICS

30:27.160 --> 30:29.094
THAT THE VERY ACT
OF OBSERVATION

30:29.100 --> 30:31.318
CHANGES THAT WHICH
IS BEING OBSERVED.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.194
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
READ THAT BOOK

30:38.200 --> 30:41.089
AND THINK THAT
YOU KNOW ME.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.627
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
YOU DON'T.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.552
YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU WON'T LET ME.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.060
OKAY, FINE.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.699
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW ?

30:57.630 --> 31:00.121
ASK ME ANYTHING.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.997
DID YOU BURN DOWN THAT HOUSE
THAT WE MADE LOVE IN ?

31:07.900 --> 31:10.050
YOU THINK I BURNED
DOWN THE HOUSE ?

31:10.060 --> 31:11.891
( laughing )
REALLY ?

31:11.900 --> 31:13.424
THAT IS SO WEIRD.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.250
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO THINK ?!

31:15.260 --> 31:17.820
YOU PUT MY BROTHER AND ME IN
THE BUS THAT KILLED OUR FATHER.

31:17.830 --> 31:20.151
YOU GET WEIRD PHONE CALLS
FROM SCREAMING PEOPLE

31:20.160 --> 31:21.957
THAT YOU
WON'T EXPLAIN.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.099
AND NOW YOU WANNA
MAKE ME FEEL STUPID
FOR BEING SUSPICIOUS ?

31:24.100 --> 31:26.250
GIVE ME A FUCKING
REASON NOT TO BE !

31:32.030 --> 31:34.954
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THIS IS...

31:36.400 --> 31:38.129
FOR YOU.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.524
AM I JUST ANOTHER
STEP ALONG YOUR WAY ?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.327
OKAY, LOOK...

31:50.330 --> 31:54.699
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE
AN INTENSE SEXUAL CONNECTION

31:54.700 --> 31:58.124
AND YES, I WOULD LIKE FOR THERE
TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.588
BUT THAT CAN'T EVER HAPPEN
UNTIL YOU TRUST ME,

32:02.600 --> 32:04.488
WHICH APPARENTLY
YOU DON'T.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.550
SHOULD
I TRUST YOU ?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.499
YES.

32:18.530 --> 32:19.827
COME HERE.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.427
IIRII

32:31.430 --> 32:32.920
IIAII

32:32.930 --> 32:34.955
"K"

32:34.960 --> 32:37.053
"E" I

32:42.300 --> 32:46.896
WHOO, TRIPLE LETTER SCORE
FOR "K", GOOD ONE, MOM.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.825
H-E-L-L.

33:00.330 --> 33:06.621
H-E-L-L-O.

33:06.630 --> 33:09.098
HELLO.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.892
IIDII

33:18.660 --> 33:20.218
"Ell

33:21.800 --> 33:23.654
IIFII

33:23.660 --> 33:26.390
"T".

33:26.400 --> 33:27.549
DEFT.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.255
WHAT IS DEFT ?

33:29.260 --> 33:32.650
WELL, IT'S A LAUNDRY DETERGENT
FROM WHEN RUTH AND I WERE KIDS.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.423
NO, IT'S A WORD.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.421
IT MEANS "SKILLED".

33:36.430 --> 33:38.295
REALLY ?

33:38.300 --> 33:40.427
USE IT IN
A SENTENCE.

33:40.430 --> 33:44.696
HE DEFTLY JUGGLED
HIS RESPONSIBILITIES.

33:46.030 --> 33:47.793
DEFT.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.950
HUH.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.752
OR "DEFT, WHERE
ITH THY THING ?"

33:53.760 --> 33:55.352
( laughing )

34:01.260 --> 34:03.524
SO, HOW YOU
BOTH DOING ?

34:03.530 --> 34:05.350
YOU KNOW, WITH
NATHANIEL PASSING.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.520
BETTER EVERY DAY.

34:06.530 --> 34:07.997
YOU KNOW,
SHIT HAPPENS.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.992
YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH
AN AWFUL THING,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.218
LOSING SOMEONE
YOU LOVE.

34:13.230 --> 34:14.857
IN TERMS OF STRESS,
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE

34:14.860 --> 34:17.055
WITH MOVING
AND GETTING FIRED.

34:17.060 --> 34:20.052
I KNOW WHEN ED AND I SPLIT UP,
I WAS DEVASTATED.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.857
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO GET OUT OF BED.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.192
I JUST WANTED TO
CURL UP AND DIE.

34:26.100 --> 34:29.297
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD
FOR MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.497
WELL, I JUST WOULDN'T
LET HER MOPE.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.627
JUST WOULDN'T LET HER.

34:34.630 --> 34:38.088
DRAGGED HER ASS,
PARDON MY FRENCH,
OUT OF BED

34:38.100 --> 34:39.658
AND TOOK HER TO
SPINNING CLASS WITH ME.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.855
AND I HATED HER FOR IT
AT THE TIME,

34:41.860 --> 34:43.748
BUT IT REALLY GOT ME
BACK ON TRACK.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.524
YOU KNOW, ENDORPHINS REALLY
ARE NATURE'S ANTI-DEPRESSANTS.

34:46.530 --> 34:49.124
LIFE GOES ON,
DOESN'T GO ON BY ITSELF.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.598
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA
KICK IT IN THE BUTT.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.091
BUT ED DIDN'T DIE.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.853
HE'S STILL ALIVE,
YOU CAN STILL SEE HIM.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.749
WHEN GINNIE GETS MARRIED,
YOU'LL BOTH BE THERE.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.699
WHEN SHE HAS CHILDREN,
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW HIM.

35:07.060 --> 35:10.450
HE'S NOT
GONE FOREVER.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.194
YEAH, WELL,
SURE, BUT...

35:16.060 --> 35:19.552
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT
IT HAD ON BOTH OUR LIVES...

35:21.230 --> 35:23.118
IT'S SIMILAR.

35:29.430 --> 35:31.352
OKAY, I HAVE
THE GREATEST IDEA.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.624
YOU GUYS ARE COMING TO
SPINNING CLASS WITH US

35:33.630 --> 35:35.188
TOMORROW MORNING,
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.919
NO OFFENSE, BUT I'D RATHER
DRIVE A RUSTY RAILROAD SPIKE

35:37.930 --> 35:39.898
THROUGH MY SKULL.

35:41.860 --> 35:43.555
JUST TRY IT ONCE.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.723
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED
HOW IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU FEEL.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.051
I FEEL FINE.

35:50.430 --> 35:53.991
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
AN INSPIRED IDEA !

35:54.000 --> 35:57.299
OKAY, LADIES,
LET'S GET TO BED

35:57.300 --> 36:00.258
BECAUSE IF YOUR BUTT ISN'T
ON THAT BIKE BY SIX A.M.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.091
DEREK DOESN'T
LET YOU IN.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.628
SO, TH ESE TITS DO
NOTHING FOR YOU, HUH ?

36:09.630 --> 36:13.589
WELL, I CAN APPRECIATE
THAT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL

36:13.600 --> 36:16.319
IN THEIR OWN COMPLETELY
ARTIFICIAL WAY.

36:16.330 --> 36:18.651
MEN LOVED THEM.

36:18.660 --> 36:20.525
WELL, REAL MEN.

36:20.530 --> 36:24.523
YOU THINK GOD CARES
THAT YOU'RE GAY ?

36:26.860 --> 36:30.296
YOU THINK GOD CARES THAT
YOU FUCKED 3O GUYS AT ONCE ?

36:30.300 --> 36:32.928
OH, SO YOU EQUATE BEING A FAG
WITH BEING A WHORE ?

36:32.930 --> 36:34.295
NO.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.892
ONE'S OKAY,
BUT ONE ISN'T ?

36:35.900 --> 36:38.027
I THINK GOD APPRECIATES IT
WHEN THERE'S LOVE INVOLVED.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.554
OH, HONEY.

36:39.560 --> 36:43.155
I LOVED EVERY MAN I EVER FUCKED
WHILE I WAS FUCKING HIM.

37:25.860 --> 37:27.452
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.496
WATCHING YOU.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.518
CLAIRE, WAKE UP.

37:36.530 --> 37:38.020
GET DRESSED.

37:38.030 --> 37:39.190
WHY ?

37:39.200 --> 37:40.394
WE'RE LEAVING,
HURRY.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.255
JESUS, MOM, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE ANNE FRANK.

37:43.260 --> 37:46.718
IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF HERE FAST
WE'LL HAVE TO GO SPINNING.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.391
OH, MY GOD.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.224
( whispering )

37:57.300 --> 37:58.824
( dog barking )

38:11.460 --> 38:13.621
THANKS FOR BUYING
ME BREAKFAST.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.757
THANK YOU FOR FINDING
MY G-SPOT THIS MORNING.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.250
ANY TIME.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.990
OH, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

38:26.230 --> 38:28.255
WOW.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.854
OH, C'MON,
IT'S JUST A KEY.

38:30.860 --> 38:32.122
NO, THIS IS GREAT.

38:32.130 --> 38:35.429
I'M JUST A LITTLE
SURPRISED, THAT'S ALL.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.795
I'M TOO NERVOUS
TO EAT.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.121
I'LL JUST DRINK COFFEE UNTIL
I START TWITCHING AND SWEATING.

38:39.130 --> 38:41.997
WHY DOES BEING A DEACON
MEAN SO MUCH TO YOU NOW ?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.753
IT WASN'T EVEN A CONSIDERATION
FOR YOU A WEEK AGO.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.398
I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S NAIVE,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.960
BUT I SEE IT AS A CHANCE
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,

38:48.960 --> 38:51.849
MAKE THE WORLD JUST
A LITTLE MORE TOLERANT.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.897
DAVID, WE HAVE OUR OWN CHURCH
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.595
WHICH MEANS THE OTHER
CHURCHES AND DIOCESES

38:56.600 --> 38:57.999
DON'T HAVE
TO TOLERATE US.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.527
FRANKLY, I RESENT THE NOTION
THAT I NEED TO BE TOLERATED.

39:01.530 --> 39:03.657
SO, WHAT, WE SHOULD JUST ALLOW
OURSELVES TO BE GHETTOIZED ?

39:03.660 --> 39:05.890
WHY DO YOU EMBRACE
AN ORGANIZATION

39:05.900 --> 39:07.595
THAT DOESN'T
EMBRACE YOU ?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.022
THE CHURCH
EM BRACES EVERYONE.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.225
OH, YEAH, RIGHT,
HATE THE SIN, LOVE THE SINNER ?

39:11.230 --> 39:13.095
THE OPERATIVE WORD
BEING HATE.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.294
WHAT IS WITH YOU ?

39:17.760 --> 39:20.354
I HAD A CHANCE
TO THINK.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.218
ISN'T THAT
YOUR BROTHER ?

39:27.230 --> 39:29.994
OKAY, LOOK, CAN WE
JUST HAVE BREAKFAST

39:34.530 --> 39:36.555
YOU PROBABLY
LIKE GEORGE WILL.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.289
DAVE.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.621
UH, HI.

39:40.630 --> 39:42.029
HEY.

39:42.030 --> 39:45.852
KEITH, YOU REMEMBER
MY BROTHER, NATE, DON'T YOU ?

39:45.860 --> 39:47.122
HOW'S IT GOING ?

39:47.130 --> 39:48.222
HEY.

39:48.230 --> 39:49.629
THIS IS BRENDA...

39:49.630 --> 39:51.291
MY...

39:52.500 --> 39:54.354
MY GIRLFRIEND.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.726
I PREFER THE TERM
"FUCK PUPPET".

39:56.730 --> 40:00.359
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE,
YOU JUST PLAY RACQUETBALL ?

40:00.360 --> 40:04.296
NO, NO, WE JUST
WORKED OUT.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.154
OH, SO, YOU GUYS
WORK OUT TOGETHER ?

40:12.600 --> 40:15.160
YEAH, YEAH,
WE DO.

40:15.660 --> 40:19.323
OH, WELL,
THAT'S GREAT.

40:21.260 --> 40:22.955
OKAY, GREAT.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.599
OKAY, YOU GUYS
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.989
YOU TOO.

40:29.530 --> 40:31.794
BYE, DAVID.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.921
OH, MY GOD, I THINK
DAVID IS GAY.

40:38.930 --> 40:40.295
I THINK DAVID
IS LUCKY.

40:40.300 --> 40:42.097
DID YOU GET
A LOOK AT THAT GUY ?

40:50.460 --> 40:52.621
CLAIRE...

40:54.930 --> 40:57.421
I HAD AN AFFAIR.

41:00.330 --> 41:03.720
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS
I WAS SEEING SOMEONE.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.192
YOUR FATHER NEVER KNEW ABOUT IT,
AT LEAST, I HOPE HE DIDN'T.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.449
AND I CALLED IT OFF
AFTER HE DIED.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.694
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I'M PROUD OF.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.518
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS ?

41:23.230 --> 41:26.028
AND WHATEVER RELATIONSHIP
YOU AND I HAVE,

41:26.030 --> 41:27.429
I WANT IT
TO BE HONEST.

41:27.430 --> 41:29.694
EVEN IF YOU HATE ME.

41:29.700 --> 41:33.852
MOM, I DON'T
HATE YOU.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.926
I REMEMBER GOING TO
THE MOVIES ON MONDAY NIGHTS,

41:38.930 --> 41:41.421
BUT I'M
17 YEARS OLD NOW.

41:41.430 --> 41:42.988
AND I HAVE
MY OWN LIFE.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.754
AND THERE'S THINGS I HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT ON MY OWN.

41:46.760 --> 41:50.548
THAT'S LIKE, NORMAL.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.758
AND I KNOW STEALING
A FOOT IS WEIRD,

41:56.760 --> 41:59.422
BUT HELLO, LIVING IN A HOUSE
WHERE A FOOT IS AVAILABLE

41:59.430 --> 42:01.421
TO BE STOLEN
IS WEIRD.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.596
I GOTTA GET
TO SCHOOL.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.528
DID YOU SEE
HIS FACE ?

42:34.530 --> 42:35.929
OH, MAN.

42:35.930 --> 42:39.149
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE LAUGHING,
BUT HE JUST LOOKED SO STUPEFIED.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.754
THE WAY HE WAS ALL, "GREAT,
GREAT, I'M HIP, I'M COOL."

42:41.760 --> 42:43.990
PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.594
SO, LISTEN, THIS THING
IN LAGUNA IS SATURDAY NIGHT.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.454
I GOT US A ROOM AT
"THE SURF AND SAND".

42:48.460 --> 42:49.859
YOU EVER BEEN THERE ?

42:49.860 --> 42:50.929
AH, NO.

42:50.930 --> 42:52.591
MAN, IT'S GONNA
BE GREAT.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.454
WE GOT A FIREPLACE
OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.

42:54.460 --> 42:57.349
KEITH, I DON'T THINK
I CAN MAKE IT AFTER ALL.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.022
I SHOULDN'T
MISS CHURCH,

43:00.030 --> 43:02.351
NOT WHILE THEY'RE CONSIDERING
ME FOR A DEACONSHIP.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.021
I'M SORRY.

43:04.030 --> 43:05.520
FINE.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.495
WE'LL COME BACK
SATURDAY NIGHT.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.899
THAT'LL WORK.

43:10.900 --> 43:12.720
I CAN GO TO CHURCH
WITH YOU ON SUNDAY.

43:12.730 --> 43:14.857
THAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

43:14.860 --> 43:17.829
THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD IDEA
FROM THE BEGINNING, HAS IT ?

43:17.830 --> 43:19.752
FINE, WHY DON'T
WE CUT OUR LOSSES

43:19.760 --> 43:21.250
AND CALL IT QUITS
RIGHT NOW ?!

43:21.260 --> 43:22.192
WHAT ?

43:22.200 --> 43:23.758
LOOK, AS LONG AS
YOU FEEL THE NEED

43:23.760 --> 43:25.296
TO KEEP OUR RELATIONSHIP
A SECRET.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.359
DAVID, YOU'RE
ASHAMED OF IT !

43:27.360 --> 43:29.726
I'M NOT HAVING ANY OF THAT,
NOT ANYMORE.

43:29.730 --> 43:31.254
I JUST CAME OUT
TO MY BROTHER.

43:31.260 --> 43:32.397
ONE STEP FORWARD.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.924
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A GIANT LEAP BACKWARDS

43:33.930 --> 43:35.420
RIGHT INTO THE ARMS
OF THE ENEMY.

43:35.430 --> 43:36.954
SO NOW I'M A NAZI
COLLABORATOR ?

43:36.960 --> 43:39.895
A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS MIGHT
SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU

43:39.900 --> 43:42.460
BEING A MEMBER
OF THE L.A.P.D.

43:44.230 --> 43:45.925
YOU FUCKING COWARD !

43:45.930 --> 43:48.728
KEITH,
PLEASE DON'T--

44:09.100 --> 44:12.149
( music playing )

44:12.830 --> 44:14.718
IT WORKS.

44:14.730 --> 44:18.052
I MUST HAVE LEFT
THE STEREO ON AGAIN.

44:18.060 --> 44:19.459
SO,

44:19.460 --> 44:23.021
YOU ARE NOT
TOO FREAKED OUT ?

44:23.030 --> 44:24.691
A LITTLE, MAYBE.

44:24.700 --> 44:27.624
IT CERTAINLY MAKES
DAVID MORE INTERESTING.

44:27.630 --> 44:31.054
NO, I MEAN ABOUT ME GIVING
YOU A KEY TO MY APARTMENT.

44:31.060 --> 44:34.621
C'MON, WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
SOME SORT OF AGING PETER PAN

44:34.630 --> 44:36.518
WHO'S GONNA DISAPPEAR AT
THE FIRST SIGN OF SOMETHING

44:36.530 --> 44:38.259
A LITTLE MORE
PERMANENT ?

44:38.260 --> 44:39.158
WELL, YEAH.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.593
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.592
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
ALLOW ME TO REFER TO YOU
AS MY GIRLFRIEND.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.755
DON'T MIND ME.

44:50.730 --> 44:53.096
I THOUGHT WE AGREED

44:53.100 --> 44:55.193
THAT YOU WOULD CALL
BEFORE YOU CAME OVER.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.725
I DID, THE HOT WATER'S
OUT IN MY BUILDING.

44:57.730 --> 44:59.891
I NEEDED TO
TAKE A SHOWER.

44:59.900 --> 45:02.926
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

45:02.930 --> 45:04.989
YOU KNOW I HATE IT
WHEN YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.592
( answering machine )
Hey, it's me.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.795
I need to use
your shower okay ?

45:08.800 --> 45:10.893
Besides, I haven't
seen you in a while

45:10.900 --> 45:13.095
and It's a fucking
gorgeous day.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.692
SATISFIED ?

45:14.700 --> 45:16.099
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A CUP OF TEA.

45:16.100 --> 45:17.453
HEY...

45:17.460 --> 45:19.849
I'LL TAKE
ONE OF THOSE.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.828
HEY, YOU BEHAVE
YOURSELF.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.749
HI.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.694
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

45:29.700 --> 45:31.099
NATE.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.829
NICE TO MEET YOU,
I'M BILLY.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.319
HI.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.858
SO, HOW LONG
YOU KNOWN BRENDA ?

45:39.860 --> 45:43.023
AH, A FEW MONTHS.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.694
SO...

45:47.700 --> 45:50.328
WHO AM I AND WHY AM I IN
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE

45:50.330 --> 45:52.355
PRACTICALLY NAKED ?

45:52.360 --> 45:54.555
YEAH.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.926
SHE'S MY SISTER.

45:56.930 --> 46:00.718
SHE'S MY MOTHER--
SISTER--
MY MOTHER.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.297
SORRY.

46:04.300 --> 46:06.689
NOBODY'S EVER LAUGHED AT THAT,
I SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.691
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

46:08.700 --> 46:10.759
SO, YOU MET
THE PARENTS YET ?

46:10.760 --> 46:12.022
YES, LAST NIGHT.

46:12.030 --> 46:13.395
WOW.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.755
YOU'VE MADE IT
PRETTY FAR.

46:17.030 --> 46:19.658
SO, WHY HAVEN'T
I HEARD ABOUT U ?

46:21.830 --> 46:23.752
NO IDEA.

46:27.260 --> 46:29.751
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
GO PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.025
HOW'D YOU GET
HER BREASTS SYNCHRONIZED ?

46:58.030 --> 47:00.225
SOME SORT OF
INDUSTRIAL EPOXY ?

47:03.200 --> 47:06.397
WOULD YOU ASK COLONEL SANDERS
FOR HIS SECRET RECIPE ?

47:06.400 --> 47:08.493
OH, C'MON,
I'M NOT GONNA TELL.

47:13.030 --> 47:16.352
I STUCK A CAN OF CAT FOOD
UNDER EACH ONE.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.397
MY SISTER-IN-LAW DID
A CAT FOOD COMMERCIAL.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.494
WE'VE GOT
LIKE 10 CASES.

47:25.060 --> 47:26.425
HEY.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.759
I'M LARRY WADD.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.648
( applause )

47:31.500 --> 47:33.229
YOU KNOW...

47:33.230 --> 47:36.893
I MET VIVECA ST. JOHN BEFORE
SHE EVEN DID HER FIRST VIDEO.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.653
YEAH.

47:39.660 --> 47:41.150
SHE WAS...

47:41.160 --> 47:45.358
SHE WAS THE FLUFFER ON THE SET
OF "DIRTY LARRY THREE".

47:47.260 --> 47:48.454
SHE WAS...

47:48.460 --> 47:52.692
FRIENDLY,
SHE WAS EAGER.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.722
I CAN HONESTLY SAY

47:55.730 --> 47:58.290
I'VE NEVER RECEIVED
A BETTER BLOW JOB IN MY LIFE.

47:58.300 --> 48:00.052
AND NOBODY WAS
EVEN FILMING IT.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.597
( applause )

48:04.560 --> 48:08.758
( female )
WHEN I FIRST MET VIVECA,
I MET HER ON "DEEP DIVING".

48:08.760 --> 48:10.796
THANK YOU.

48:11.700 --> 48:14.157
AND I HAD NEVER GONE DOWN
ON A GIRL BEFORE,

48:14.160 --> 48:15.957
SO, NATURALLY
I WAS NERVOUS,

48:15.960 --> 48:19.726
BUT VIVECA WAS SO WARM
AND RELAXED ABOUT IT.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.290
SHE REALLY
PUT ME AT EASE.

48:22.300 --> 48:26.054
HER AND THE TWO XANAX
SHE GAVE ME.

48:26.060 --> 48:30.292
WHEN I FIRST HAD TO DO
A DOUBLE PENETRATION,

48:30.300 --> 48:32.655
I WAS LIKE
A TOTAL WRECK.

48:32.660 --> 48:35.754
BUT VIVECA CAME THROUGH

48:35.760 --> 48:38.695
LIKE SUCH
THE PRO SHE IS.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.859
I MEAN WAS.

48:48.830 --> 48:51.390
NATE, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN THERE ?

48:51.400 --> 48:52.992
A FUNERAL.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.490
FOR WHOM ?

48:54.500 --> 48:55.922
A PROSTITUTE ?

48:57.900 --> 49:02.451
A WOMAN WHO WAS A STAR
OF ADULT VIDEOS.

49:02.460 --> 49:05.327
MOM, WE'RE GONNA CLEAR
LIKE EIGHT GRAND FROM THIS.

49:05.330 --> 49:07.798
WE CAN FINALLY PAY FOR
ALL THAT AIR CONDITIONING WORK.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.622
I'M JUST GLAD YOUR SISTER
IS AT SCHOOL.

49:16.460 --> 49:17.791
IT WAS AWFUL.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.552
THEY WERE LIKE
BEST FRIENDS.

49:19.560 --> 49:22.028
THEY WERE BOTH
LIKE CHEERLEADERS

49:22.030 --> 49:24.055
FOR THIS TOTALLY
PLASTIC WAY OF LIFE.

49:24.060 --> 49:26.358
LIKE, SPINNING CLASS
SOLVES EVERYTHING.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.749
AND THEY'RE BOTH
HOT FOR THE SAME GUY,

49:28.760 --> 49:30.625
IT WAS CREEPY.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.890
MY MOM'S--

49:42.500 --> 49:44.559
MY MOM IS JUST
SO FUCKING SAD.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.291
I WISH I COULD
HELP HER.

49:51.660 --> 49:53.594
SO, HELP HER.

49:55.130 --> 49:58.019
NOW, MRS. MURDOCH,
SOME PEOPLE PREFER

49:58.030 --> 49:59.520
THE SOLEMNITY
OF A CHURCH

49:59.530 --> 50:02.158
AND ST. BARTHOLOMEW IS
A BEAUTIFUL SETTING.

50:02.160 --> 50:06.449
HERE, HOWEVER, ONE IS MORE FREE
TO CUSTOMIZE THE SERVICE.

50:06.460 --> 50:08.291
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRU PT.

50:08.300 --> 50:10.256
I JUST HAD TO
TELL SOMEBODY.

50:10.260 --> 50:13.297
VIVECA LOOKS
SO GREAT.

50:13.300 --> 50:16.997
HER TITS HAVE NEVER
LOOKED BETTER.

50:18.900 --> 50:21.721
SHE WAS LIKE
A SISTER TO ME.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.497
I'M SO GLAD THAT
YOU'RE PLEASED.

50:32.500 --> 50:36.049
WE WANT TO REMEMBER HER
AT HER VERY BEST, DON'T WE ?

50:36.060 --> 50:40.724
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M HELPING
SOME OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

50:40.730 --> 50:42.527
OKAY.

50:42.530 --> 50:43.952
I'LL TALK TO YOU
AFTER THE SERVICE ?

50:43.960 --> 50:45.723
OKAY.

50:52.100 --> 50:54.591
I THINK WE'LL HAVE DAD'S
SERVICE AT THE CHURCH.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.329
FINE.

50:56.330 --> 50:58.218
I'M NOT
A RELIGIOUS MAN.

50:58.230 --> 51:00.448
BUT I DO
BELIEVE IN GOD.

51:00.460 --> 51:03.623
IF I WERE TO MAKE
A LIST OF THE THINGS

51:03.630 --> 51:07.020
I THANK GOD
FOR THE MOST...

51:09.200 --> 51:12.192
FUCKING VIV WOULD BE
AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.954
SHE WAS A GODDAMN
FORCE OF NATURE.

51:15.960 --> 51:20.750
AND I LOVED HER AND I KNOW
GOD LOVED HER TOO.

51:20.760 --> 51:23.524
I KNOW HE KNEW JUST
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

51:23.530 --> 51:27.091
AND HOW MUCH JOY...

51:27.100 --> 51:30.524
SHE WOULD BRING
TO THE WORLD.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.595
FOR DAVID JAMES FISHER,
CHOSEN DEACON IN YOUR CHURCH,

51:45.600 --> 51:47.522
WE PRAY TO YOU,
OH LORD.

51:47.530 --> 51:49.555
( congregation )
LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.596
THAT HE MAY FAITHFULLY
FULFILL THE DUTIES

51:51.600 --> 51:52.999
OF THIS MINISTRY,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.049
BUILD UP YOUR CHURCH
AND GLORIFY YOUR NAME,

51:56.060 --> 51:57.994
WE PRAY TO YOU,
OH LORD.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.093
LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.295
THAT BY THE INDWELLING
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

52:02.300 --> 52:04.393
HE MAY BE SUSTAINED
AND ENCOURAGED

52:04.400 --> 52:06.095
TO PERSEVERE
TO THE END,

52:06.100 --> 52:07.897
WE PRAY TO YOU,
OH LORD.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.697
LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.999
FOR ALL WHO FEAR GOD AND
BELIEVE IN YOU, LORD CHRIST,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.221
THAT OUR DIVISIONS MAY CEASE
AND THAT ALL MAY BE AS ONE

52:17.230 --> 52:19.551
AS YOU AND
THE FATHER ARE ONE.

52:19.560 --> 52:22.097
WE PRAY TO YOU,
OH LORD.

52:22.100 --> 52:24.557
LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.395
WAY TO GO, DAVE.

52:41.500 --> 52:43.923
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS JOIN THE KIWANIS CLUB

52:43.930 --> 52:46.148
AND FISHER & SONS WILL
HAVE ALL OUR BASES COVERED.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.399
WHERE'S KEITH ?

52:49.400 --> 52:51.789
HE'S JUST
A FRIEND, NATE.

52:55.430 --> 52:57.990
VERY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

52:58.460 --> 52:59.859
HELLO.

53:03.330 --> 53:05.821
SO MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TOMORROW NIGHT ?

53:05.830 --> 53:08.094
NOTHING AS FAR
AS I KNOW.

53:08.100 --> 53:09.556
WHY ?

53:09.560 --> 53:12.120
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
WANT TO GO SEE A MOVIE

53:12.130 --> 53:14.257
OR RENT A MOVIE
OR SOMETHING.

53:14.260 --> 53:17.991
OKAY, BUT IF YOU CRY,
THE WHOLE THING IS OFF.

53:20.700 --> 53:22.918
THANKS FOR
COMING TODAY.

53:22.930 --> 53:24.921
I KNOW YOU MUST'VE
FOUND THIS ALL A LITTLE--

53:24.930 --> 53:26.625
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
I LOVED IT.

53:26.630 --> 53:28.894
ALL THAT PAGEANTRY,
IT'S SO TRIPPY,

53:28.900 --> 53:30.652
IT'S LIKE
A FELLINI MOVIE.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.651
WELL, IT WAS KIND OF COOL
BEING WITH YOU HERE.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.389
IN FRONT OF GOD
AND EVERYBODY.

53:37.530 --> 53:40.693
YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE IN GOD, DO YOU ?

53:40.700 --> 53:42.349
WELL, YEAH.

53:42.360 --> 53:45.488
I MEAN, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN SOME BEARDED OLD WHITE MAN

53:45.500 --> 53:47.149
UP IN A CLOUD, BUT...

53:47.160 --> 53:49.048
I BELIEVE
IN SOMETHING.

53:49.060 --> 53:52.291
SOME SORT OF UNDEFINABLE
CREATIVE FORCE.

53:52.300 --> 53:55.224
I THINK IT'S JUST
ALL TOTALLY RAN DOM.

53:55.230 --> 53:56.652
REALLY ?

53:56.660 --> 53:58.525
YEAH.

53:58.530 --> 54:00.498
WE LIVE, WE DIE.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.889
ULTIMATELY, NOTHING
MEANS ANYTHING.

54:02.900 --> 54:05.619
HOW CAN YOU
LIVE LIKE THAT ?

54:05.630 --> 54:06.858
I DON'T KNOW.

54:06.860 --> 54:08.555
SOMETIMES I WAKE UP
SO FUCKING EMPTY,

54:08.560 --> 54:10.528
I WISH I'D NEVER
BEEN BORN,

54:10.530 --> 54:13.124
BUT WHAT CHOICE
DO I HAVE ?
