WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:01.399
Previously on Greek...

00:01.520 --> 00:03.855
So how is the real world?

00:03.889 --> 00:07.258
- Oh. - Tell rusty I'm using
my not-rape taxi whistle.

00:07.292 --> 00:09.494
- Talk to you later, bye.
- Your lsat score was higher than mine.

00:09.528 --> 00:11.896
- So was my gpa.
- Careful, Cartwright.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.232
I've been accepted
into cru law.

00:14.266 --> 00:17.301
- I'm ready to kick your ass in law school.
- Bring it. And me, too.

00:17.336 --> 00:19.737
- What do you want?
- I want you to want more for yourself.

00:19.771 --> 00:23.141
Because you deserve it for you,
not just for me.

00:23.175 --> 00:26.177
- I don't remember him from photos.
- Me neither, but he's a legacy.

00:26.211 --> 00:29.881
- Welcome to kt.
- New pledge spidey!

00:29.915 --> 00:33.017
Maybe you should try being one of the guys.
What about joining a fraternity?

00:33.051 --> 00:35.553
Which one of you little maniacs
wants to bid me first?

00:35.587 --> 00:38.189
- Dale, what are you doing here?
- Picking the number one house.

00:38.223 --> 00:41.926
- Congratulations. - I cannot wait
to see how rusty takes this news.

00:45.797 --> 00:48.733
- Oh, hey, the roommate returneth.
- Hey.

00:49.968 --> 00:51.235
With youeth.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.237
Yeah.
We've been at Dana's.

00:53.272 --> 00:54.906
Her roommate was out
of town for the weekend.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.141
<i>Yeah. So we started re-watching
lost from the beginning</i>

00:57.176 --> 00:59.610
to count the number of questions
that they never answered.

00:59.645 --> 01:01.612
Then we started
pretending we were lost,

01:01.647 --> 01:04.649
and couldn't get off
the island of her bed.

01:07.286 --> 01:09.387
Classes start tomorrow.
How've you been?

01:09.421 --> 01:12.056
Oh, yeah.
Upper division, baby!

01:12.090 --> 01:15.526
You know, we haven't had a chance to talk
since rush, but I'm sorry kt didn't work out.

01:15.561 --> 01:19.163
We can only take legacies because
of the Jack-ass Omega chis.

01:19.198 --> 01:21.999
That's a little harsh. How do you know
another fraternity didn't go after me?

01:22.034 --> 01:24.602
We should do something to cheer you up.
Something crazy.

01:24.636 --> 01:27.138
Ooh! We could
have a dinner party!

01:27.172 --> 01:30.808
- A dinner party?
- A murder mystery dinner party!

01:30.842 --> 01:33.778
And I'll cook.
It'll be tofu, couscous and murder!

01:33.812 --> 01:37.448
- Sure. It'll be killer fun.
- Yeah!

01:37.482 --> 01:41.652
I'm actually
gonna be, uh, pretty busy.

01:41.687 --> 01:45.389
- Why are you wearing an Omega chi pledge pin?
- I'm pledging Omega chi!

01:45.424 --> 01:48.826
- Omega who?
- Let's go, plebe!

01:48.860 --> 01:50.995
You got more Mayo-ritos to finish!
What do you say?!

01:51.029 --> 01:52.563
Thank you, sir,
may I have another?

01:56.535 --> 01:59.470
- Sorry about the door, Rus.
- Yeah. Don't...

02:08.646 --> 02:10.481
What are you doing up?

02:12.651 --> 02:14.719
Can't sleep.

02:14.753 --> 02:16.721
I miss summer.

02:16.755 --> 02:18.356
And Evan.

02:18.390 --> 02:23.527
Well, I appreciate you respecting
the "no boys upstairs" rule.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.365
Oh, sure.

02:27.399 --> 02:29.867
And he wanted to get a good night's sleep
before his first day of law school.

02:29.901 --> 02:33.170
Torts and civil
procedures tomorrow.

02:33.205 --> 02:36.841
I'm re-reading
the first 20 chapters.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.476
Seriously,
it is so much material.

02:38.510 --> 02:41.579
It makes me wonder if it
would have been this bad at GW.

02:41.613 --> 02:44.048
- Well, I'm glad you're here.
- Really?

02:44.082 --> 02:48.719
'Cause this is the last of the Cheesaritos, and
it's your job as house mom to go get more.

02:48.754 --> 02:51.722
- That's why we let you stay here for free.
- It is on my list.

02:51.757 --> 02:54.125
Right after I learn what
habeas corpus means.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.428
- Night.
- Night.

03:11.109 --> 03:13.844
Come on,
it is a four-digit code.

03:13.879 --> 03:16.213
How did we survive without
a house mom for so...?

03:19.117 --> 03:20.484
Rebecca! Rebecca!

03:30.062 --> 03:32.763
I have a fire... pokey-thing!

03:34.333 --> 03:37.268
- Casey?
- Burglar?

03:41.640 --> 03:45.476
Ashleigh!

03:45.510 --> 03:48.412
Oh, my God!
You changed the keypad code!

03:48.447 --> 03:51.382
- What are you doing here?
- Ashleigh!

03:51.416 --> 03:53.851
- Is this your first grown-up vacay?
- Yeah. Well, kind of.

03:53.885 --> 03:58.289
Well, it's more of a permanent
vacay 'cause I got fired.

04:00.792 --> 04:03.227
From your dream job?

04:03.261 --> 04:05.363
I'm so sorry.

04:06.698 --> 04:09.266
And I'm so not
done hugging you.

04:09.301 --> 04:12.403
Another one's back.

04:14.239 --> 04:16.906
Come on in, sis.

04:26.079 --> 04:28.214
- We stayed up too
late, didn't we? - No way.

04:28.248 --> 04:32.351
I haven't seen you in months.
And I still think what faith did sucks.

04:32.385 --> 04:36.288
Those hours, all that running around, and
then she fires you? You were unpaid!

04:36.323 --> 04:39.792
I know! I'm so glad to be
back here with you,

04:39.826 --> 04:41.927
and all my friends,
and free food.

04:41.962 --> 04:44.063
Well, it's not exactly free.

04:44.097 --> 04:46.365
Whatever.
You're such a house mom.

04:46.399 --> 04:49.869
- How's that going?
- Um... so far, so good.

04:49.903 --> 04:52.104
It bought a lot of goodwill
with my parents,

04:52.139 --> 04:56.408
who were less than thrilled with
my game of musical law schools.

04:56.443 --> 04:58.310
Oh, what did your parents say?

04:58.345 --> 05:01.347
Oh, they said I could always move back home.
And pay rent.

05:01.381 --> 05:05.084
And work in my dad's accounting firm.
That'd just be New York with math.

05:05.118 --> 05:08.220
- So you're definitely not going
back to New York? - I'm not sure.

05:08.255 --> 05:10.589
- How long are you staying?
- Calm down, the closer.

05:10.624 --> 05:13.959
I have no idea
what I'm going to do.

05:13.994 --> 05:17.797
I had this great plan and now I
don't, so I'm kinda freaking out.

05:17.831 --> 05:20.766
So for now, I plan to eat
this toast and take a shower

05:20.801 --> 05:22.768
and have no regrets
about quitting.

05:22.803 --> 05:26.705
- I thought you said you were fired.
- Yeah. Well, it was mutual.

05:26.740 --> 05:30.009
You know, creative differences.
What time does your class start?

05:30.043 --> 05:32.878
- Oh, crap. Have I got to go.
- Wait! Hold on!

05:35.682 --> 05:38.017
- I made you lunch.
- Aw!

05:38.051 --> 05:42.121
Ten tater chips,
four slices of Turkey

05:42.155 --> 05:44.456
and a cookie
the size of my head.

05:44.491 --> 05:47.893
- You're welcome.
- Well, I'm glad you're back.

05:47.928 --> 05:50.863
- For however long you're here.
- Me, too.

05:50.897 --> 05:54.400
- So are you ready for your first day of law school?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.974
What...?

06:04.644 --> 06:08.147
- Spidey?
- I reported for pledge duties,

06:08.181 --> 06:10.683
but, uh, the brothers
were unresponsive.

06:10.717 --> 06:14.119
Wow. I'm off to class.

06:14.154 --> 06:16.055
Cap? It's, like, 9:30.

06:16.089 --> 06:19.158
Am. In the morning.

06:19.192 --> 06:21.126
Yeah. I'm trying this
semester, remember?

06:21.161 --> 06:25.030
That's great, but we have an emergency.
Dale's pledging Omega chi.

06:25.065 --> 06:27.166
Really? You know,
if I think about it,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.802
Dale's always had a proclivity to
joining cult-like institutions.

06:29.836 --> 06:32.872
Listen to me. "Proclivity.
" I'm not even in class yet.

06:32.906 --> 06:36.242
- We hate the Omega chis, right?
- Hey, pledge spidey,

06:36.276 --> 06:38.644
could you tidy up a little bit
while cappie and I talk?

06:38.678 --> 06:42.548
- I think they gave Dale a bid just to mess with me.
- It wouldn't surprise me.

06:42.582 --> 06:44.683
Maybe they were the ones who
called the cops on our rush party

06:44.718 --> 06:47.186
to get back at us
for spring break.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.288
I bet daley will drop out
before anything bad happens.

06:49.322 --> 06:52.524
He's far too gentle a soul
to fraternize with such nimrods.

06:52.559 --> 06:54.660
What if we make him a kt first?

06:54.694 --> 06:56.829
- We can only take legacies.
- What if we come up with a way

06:56.863 --> 07:00.332
- to make him a legacy? - Yeah, but how are you...
? Spidey, just leave it.

07:00.367 --> 07:03.168
If you get killed,
we don't have any more pledges.

07:04.571 --> 07:07.239
Ok. We need Dale here.
We're the house he really wanted.

07:07.274 --> 07:10.542
Besides, our one pledge
is kind of a dud, anyway.

07:10.577 --> 07:14.113
- He's not that bad.
- Help me! Help me! Help me!

07:15.949 --> 07:18.651
- I'll go save spider-woman.
- I'll save Dale.

07:22.689 --> 07:24.056
There you are.

07:30.463 --> 07:33.933
Hey, cappie. You do
realize it's 10am, right?

07:33.967 --> 07:36.602
Uh, I believe
our truce is over.

07:36.636 --> 07:39.972
Look, I didn't bust the kt rush
party, if that's what you think.

07:40.006 --> 07:42.441
No, no, no, I'm sure there
are plenty of Omega chis

07:42.475 --> 07:46.045
who needed to screw us over so they
could make up for an election scandal

07:46.079 --> 07:49.615
and get back in the good graces
of their dumb-ass brothers.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.951
Well, I still come in peace.

07:59.826 --> 08:03.629
So a little ancient philosophy

08:03.663 --> 08:05.030
to cleanse the palate
of the soul?

08:05.065 --> 08:07.800
I guess so. I heard
the Professor was cool.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.169
- What about you?
- I'm trying this year.

08:10.203 --> 08:14.306
Which means a panoply of pre-noon
classes has opened up before me.

08:14.341 --> 08:16.308
Welcome, truth-seekers.

08:16.343 --> 08:19.578
And congratulations
on taking a brave first step

08:19.612 --> 08:22.881
beyond the confines of Cru's
all-too-familiar

08:22.916 --> 08:25.417
"memorize and spew" curriculum.

08:25.452 --> 08:28.620
There are no tests, unless you
count the personal challenges

08:28.655 --> 08:31.290
inherent in any true
philosophical journey.

08:31.324 --> 08:33.792
No tests? Is this
what happens before noon?

08:33.827 --> 08:36.828
- I freaking love morning-time. - ...
Socrates, one of the founders

08:36.863 --> 08:40.366
of Western philosophy,
who believed that all you need

08:40.400 --> 08:43.869
to discover the secrets of
the universe is a question.

08:43.903 --> 08:46.405
This ideology birthed
the socratic method,

08:46.439 --> 08:48.807
a series of questions
from teacher to student,

08:48.842 --> 08:52.111
designed to force one
to examine one's own beliefs

08:52.145 --> 08:55.614
to achieve a higher sense
of understanding and truth.

08:55.648 --> 08:58.350
Higher sense of understanding?
I think I'd do better with tests.

08:58.385 --> 09:00.986
Your first assignment
will be to pick a partner.

09:01.021 --> 09:05.591
One of you will assume the role of socrates,
the other one, his star pupil, Plato.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.527
Have a dialogue and see where you get.
Your prompt?

09:12.432 --> 09:15.801
- "Why are we here?
" - I was just gonna ask myself that.

09:15.835 --> 09:18.570
- Partners?
- Uh, well,

09:18.605 --> 09:21.940
I guess if I'm gonna discover the secrets of
the universe with anyone, it's gonna be you.

09:21.975 --> 09:25.844
You flatter me.
And you're correct.

09:35.388 --> 09:38.824
Oh... hey, hey!

09:38.858 --> 09:41.326
Psst! Why didn't you
save me a seat?

09:41.361 --> 09:44.530
And miss a chance to see you
squirming in the front row?

09:44.564 --> 09:46.632
I was here 20 minutes early
to get this one.

09:46.666 --> 09:50.002
Fair enough, chambers.
Game on.

09:50.036 --> 09:51.970
Every man and woman
for him or herself.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.773
"Look
to your left, look to your right..."

09:54.808 --> 09:57.810
"One of them won't be here"?
I hope for your sake that isn't true.

09:57.844 --> 10:01.013
Hi, Jan Carnes, my husband Jim.
Northwestern undergrads.

10:01.047 --> 10:03.682
And fellow first year
lambs to the slaughter.

10:03.716 --> 10:07.786
Welcome,
welcome, welcome, first years,

10:07.821 --> 10:11.356
to the... study of torts.

10:11.391 --> 10:14.460
By now, you've done the reading,
you've noticed the copious material.

10:14.494 --> 10:19.131
It gets worse and we move fast, so I suggest
you find a damn good study group asap.

10:19.165 --> 10:21.767
Torts is defined

10:21.801 --> 10:24.736
as the body of law concerned
with civil wrongs.

10:24.771 --> 10:29.408
Torts differs from criminal law by, among
other things, the burden of proof.

10:29.442 --> 10:34.680
Would you care to illuminate that
difference for me, Mr... Chambers?

10:34.714 --> 10:37.916
Yeah. Uh, the burden of proof
in criminal law,

10:37.951 --> 10:41.587
it differs from torts
in as such... that, um...

10:41.621 --> 10:43.989
Would anyone care to help out
miss teen South Carolina?

10:46.092 --> 10:49.261
You. Yes? In the red.
Name, please?

10:49.295 --> 10:52.164
Um, Casey Cartwright. And I think what Mr.
Chambers meant to say

10:52.198 --> 10:55.367
is that criminal cases must be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt

10:55.401 --> 11:00.372
and civil cases only require a
preponderance of the evidence.

11:00.406 --> 11:04.510
Chambers. It's no free pass
being the progeny of the elite.

11:04.544 --> 11:08.847
I believe it took jfk, Jr.
Three tries to pass the bar.

11:09.949 --> 11:11.884
That's good, Ms. Cartwright.

11:11.918 --> 11:15.854
Now, how about Mrs. carnes?

11:15.889 --> 11:18.524
In the lange motors case,
from the reading,

11:18.558 --> 11:21.860
was sexual harassment proved by
a preponderance of the evidence?

11:21.895 --> 11:25.531
In that case, yes, but the facts to me
implied that she might've been lying.

11:25.565 --> 11:28.367
Which, in that event, hurts
real sexual harassment victims.

11:28.401 --> 11:31.637
Interesting. Anyone care to
cite a present-day example?

11:32.972 --> 11:35.974
- You, sir, name?
- Jim carnes.

11:36.009 --> 11:39.011
Uh, we heard about one right
here at cru law, right?

11:39.045 --> 11:42.581
Someone contested their admissions
denial and claimed sexual harassment.

11:42.615 --> 11:45.417
- I'm not familiar.
- Apparently, this woman,

11:45.451 --> 11:47.452
who received an unfavorable
letter of recommendation,

11:47.487 --> 11:51.323
claimed the guy was biased because
she was having sex with him

11:51.357 --> 11:54.326
- and had it rescinded so she could get in.
- Well...

11:54.360 --> 11:57.896
Does she have a case?
Mr. chambers?

11:57.931 --> 12:01.433
Uh, she doesn't need one.
She got in.

12:04.037 --> 12:06.071
I would imagine.

12:06.105 --> 12:09.741
Legality aside,
if she had sex with the guy

12:09.776 --> 12:11.577
and still received a bad rec,

12:11.611 --> 12:14.613
it sounds like not getting into law
school isn't her only problem.

12:16.783 --> 12:20.652
- Or maybe she didn't have sex
with him at all. - Or that also.

12:22.155 --> 12:26.024
- Elaborate, Ms. Cartwright.
- What I meant to say

12:26.059 --> 12:28.994
is that when dealing
with a preponderance,

12:29.028 --> 12:32.764
there's always room for doubt.
Maybe we're all misinformed.

12:32.799 --> 12:36.268
Maybe she didn't have sex with him and
that's why he wrote the bad letter.

12:36.302 --> 12:39.738
Maybe she confronted him, for all we
know, and that's why he rescinded it.

12:39.772 --> 12:42.774
I mean, what proof do you...

12:42.809 --> 12:45.877
Or we, for that matter, have?

12:49.782 --> 12:52.150
Ok, causation.

12:55.054 --> 12:57.356
Right.

12:58.591 --> 13:00.192
Hey, your text
said it was urgent.

13:00.226 --> 13:02.995
Hey. Yeah, I just...
What happened to you?

13:03.029 --> 13:05.564
This? Just some new gear
I flipped at the mall.

13:05.598 --> 13:08.166
I'm on my way to a pledge
mixer with the pi pi pis.

13:08.201 --> 13:11.970
- You mean the tri pis?
- I just wanna look sharp for the ladies, right?

13:12.005 --> 13:13.472
Well, you look like
a teen movie villain.

13:13.506 --> 13:15.540
And you look like the nerdy girl
before her makeover.

13:15.575 --> 13:17.609
- Oh! - What if I told
you there's a way

13:17.644 --> 13:19.645
to get you out of those shirts
and into a better fraternity?

13:19.679 --> 13:21.747
I'd say that's impossible.

13:21.781 --> 13:26.251
- What's this? - Meet your new Uncle
on your mother's side, Conrad Liddell.

13:26.286 --> 13:27.819
My friend's a
criminal psych major.

13:27.854 --> 13:29.855
So she scanned your photo
and then mocked up

13:29.889 --> 13:31.823
- what you could look like at 50.
- Pretty authentic, right?

13:31.858 --> 13:35.594
With those jowls? I look like
Michael Douglas in a wind tunnel.

13:35.628 --> 13:38.664
The real Conrad Liddell
was a kappa tau at uva.

13:38.698 --> 13:42.567
This will make you a legacy so you can
rush kappa tau and wear whatever you want.

13:42.602 --> 13:44.870
I don't want to wear
whatever I want.

13:44.904 --> 13:48.240
The guys say you should dress for the
job you want, not the one you have.

13:48.274 --> 13:50.542
That's pretty smart, right?

13:52.312 --> 13:55.314
Look, I think they might
be leading you on, ok?

13:55.348 --> 13:57.683
It's not a real bid.
They're just messing with you

13:57.717 --> 14:00.018
to get back at me and kappa tau
for spring break.

14:00.053 --> 14:01.486
You know what?
It is a real bid.

14:01.521 --> 14:04.056
So you can take your
Conrad Liddell glamour shot

14:04.090 --> 14:05.691
and stick it in
your bunsen burner.

14:05.725 --> 14:07.225
Rusty's just
looking out for you.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.628
Yeah? Ok. Well, the Omega chis
want me for me.

14:09.662 --> 14:13.165
So just accept that,
you kappa tau.

14:18.713 --> 14:21.749
So besides picking up trash,
what else do kt pledges do?

14:21.783 --> 14:25.186
Party, pranks,
general campus mayhem.

14:25.220 --> 14:28.022
One time I TP'd my neighbor's house,
but then I cleaned it up the next day

14:28.056 --> 14:30.791
- 'cause he got mad.
- Pledge spidey!

14:30.826 --> 14:34.395
Stand completely still
and silent for five minutes!

14:34.429 --> 14:37.364
Hey, pledge educator.
How's the kt crop coming?

14:37.399 --> 14:40.267
Oh, they're great.
He's great. It's great.

14:40.302 --> 14:43.204
- And the Omega chi crop?
- Oh, yeah, they're great.

14:43.238 --> 14:45.573
- Even Dale?
- I know, I can't believe it either,

14:45.607 --> 14:48.909
- but he's way into pledging.
- But are you way into him?

14:48.944 --> 14:51.812
I mean, he's not exactly ripped from
the pages of a j. Crew catalog.

14:51.847 --> 14:55.282
We don't all look like j. Crew models.
Have you seen Marco lately?

14:55.317 --> 15:00.654
Dale's the guy who started u-sag to
destroy fraternities a couple years ago.

15:00.689 --> 15:03.290
He's got a glow-in-the-dark
Jesus hanging above his bed.

15:03.325 --> 15:05.726
Admit it, you guys
are screwing with him.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.595
Do you really think
that we would do that?

15:07.629 --> 15:10.664
- That I would do that?
- So, what happened?

15:10.699 --> 15:12.633
Did you sell Dale
to them before bid night?

15:12.667 --> 15:15.136
I didn't have to, Rus,
'cause I wasn't even there.

15:15.170 --> 15:18.005
They like what he brings.
He respects tradition.

15:18.039 --> 15:20.174
He's a complete gentleman.
And he makes a huge effort.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.611
- Dale's pledging is legit?
- Completely.

15:27.449 --> 15:30.317
My equilibrium's
off for some reason.

15:32.921 --> 15:34.522
Ok. So in Manhattan,

15:34.556 --> 15:37.491
here's how we check to see if
our cosmos have been roofied.

15:37.526 --> 15:39.527
So dip your finger
in it like so,

15:39.561 --> 15:43.397
and then dab the circle on the
special coasters I gave you.

15:43.431 --> 15:45.533
- And if it turns blue...
- You're pregnant?

15:45.567 --> 15:46.800
If you don't do it right.

15:48.537 --> 15:49.470
Oh, Casey!

15:49.504 --> 15:51.672
A toast to Casey's

15:51.706 --> 15:53.807
- first day of law school!
- Oh, thanks.

15:53.842 --> 15:54.975
No, wait!
That might've been roofied!

15:57.679 --> 16:00.181
Ah! What difference
does it make?

16:00.215 --> 16:02.516
Everyone at law school thinks
I slept my way in anyway.

16:02.551 --> 16:04.818
Wait, what? How?

16:04.853 --> 16:07.488
The Joel-thing made it
out of the admissions office,

16:07.522 --> 16:11.192
through the rumor mill, and somehow
I became an opportunistic slut.

16:11.226 --> 16:13.127
But you didn't do
anything wrong.

16:13.161 --> 16:15.329
Then why do I feel like Betsy
when she told everyone

16:15.363 --> 16:17.798
she didn't puke in the DVD player
after winter formal junior year?

16:17.832 --> 16:19.667
I didn't!

16:22.771 --> 16:25.472
Ok, but these are law students.
Aren't they supposed to know the truth,

16:25.507 --> 16:27.841
and handle it and stuff?

16:27.876 --> 16:31.212
- Yeah... - One
thing I learned from my dad:

16:31.246 --> 16:36.350
Deny, deny, deny. And if you can't
deny, pin it on someone else.

16:36.384 --> 16:39.653
No, I'm not gonna do that.
This isn't the Greek system.

16:39.688 --> 16:41.388
This is law school,
these are mature adults.

16:41.423 --> 16:43.991
I'm going to go in there
and plead my case.

16:44.025 --> 16:45.926
Well, I'll drink to that!

16:45.961 --> 16:48.429
Well, you seem less
freaked out than this morning.

16:48.463 --> 16:51.699
Because you know what's better
than being in college?

16:51.733 --> 16:55.069
Being at college and not having to go to class.
I had the best day ever!

16:55.103 --> 16:58.739
I had no school, no job.
It was like summer in September.

16:59.841 --> 17:01.775
- I got a pedicure.
- Oh!

17:01.810 --> 17:05.846
I hate you and I'm so sick of school already.
I can't stand it.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.383
Ok, now I am in the
mood for that toast.

17:09.416 --> 17:14.221
Oh! And look at our coasters.
There are no roofies in our drinks.

17:14.256 --> 17:16.457
- Cheers!
- Yay!

17:16.491 --> 17:18.425
No roofies.

17:20.662 --> 17:23.763
- Oh, dibs on socrates.
- How come I have to be the student?

17:23.798 --> 17:26.165
<i>Because Plato's
symposium is a...</i>

17:26.201 --> 17:29.937
"Handbook for those embarking
on a homoerotic-spiritual path."

17:29.971 --> 17:34.608
- Really?
- Now, tell me, young Plato,

17:34.643 --> 17:37.778
- why are we here?
- Because we're doing this assignment.

17:37.812 --> 17:39.647
But why are we
doing this assignment?

17:39.681 --> 17:41.415
Because the
Professor told us to.

17:41.449 --> 17:45.052
- Ok, a little help, Plato.
- Ok, um...

17:45.086 --> 17:48.789
I'm here because I'm
interested in examining life,

17:48.823 --> 17:51.325
and my life
and why I do what I do.

17:51.359 --> 17:55.729
And why do you think you do the things you
do, the way you do the things you do?

17:57.198 --> 18:00.334
Because...

18:00.368 --> 18:03.337
I don't know how to answer that.
This all sounds like stoner talk.

18:03.371 --> 18:07.007
- Well, we could, if you
think it'd help. - What?

18:07.042 --> 18:09.276
- No.
- As your intellectual midwife,

18:09.311 --> 18:11.912
- I really think it would help loosen up your...
- This is for a real grade.

18:11.946 --> 18:15.082
What? Come on.
"Why are we here?"

18:15.116 --> 18:18.352
She's ordering us to get high.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.622
You know what?
I have a better idea.

18:21.656 --> 18:23.190
One that doesn't
involve us getting high.

18:23.224 --> 18:25.859
You say that
like it's a good thing.

18:30.265 --> 18:32.366
You got in pretty
late last night.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.536
I had a pledge thing at the
fraternity that doesn't want me.

18:35.570 --> 18:38.539
Look, I was
out of line earlier.

18:38.573 --> 18:41.008
Apparently,
Omega chi totally wants you.

18:41.042 --> 18:43.210
Which is... great.

18:43.244 --> 18:46.647
But why do you want them?
Out of all the fraternities on campus,

18:46.681 --> 18:50.784
you picked the one house that's the
epitome of the Greek system you hated

18:50.819 --> 18:52.553
and one currently I
don't care for either.

18:52.587 --> 18:55.889
Not everything in the
Greek system is about you.

18:55.924 --> 18:58.359
What about God?
I mean, did you talk to him?

18:58.393 --> 19:00.728
- Or your parents?
- Most pre-war fraternities

19:00.762 --> 19:04.565
were founded on Christian values, including Omega chi.
We're a divine institution.

19:04.599 --> 19:06.400
My parents offered
to pay my pledge dues.

19:06.434 --> 19:08.635
My dad even chuckled when
I told him about the branding.

19:08.670 --> 19:12.706
- What branding?
- You know, just a little...

19:12.741 --> 19:14.775
Action right there.
Omega chi.

19:14.809 --> 19:16.977
They're gonna brand
their letters on your ass?

19:17.011 --> 19:19.179
No, I'm just a pledge.
I can't get all the letters.

19:19.214 --> 19:22.049
- Just the "x.
" - Because it marks the spot of a moron?

19:22.083 --> 19:23.550
Kt doesn't even do any of that.

19:23.585 --> 19:25.386
Because Omega means "the end,"

19:25.420 --> 19:27.020
and there is no end
to Omega chi.

19:27.055 --> 19:28.822
You get an Omega when
you've done pledging,

19:28.857 --> 19:31.692
to remind you that even though your
time as a novice is complete, you...

19:31.726 --> 19:33.827
I shouldn't be telling
you any of this.

19:33.862 --> 19:36.363
You shouldn't know any of this.
It's like you joined a cult.

19:36.398 --> 19:38.465
They told me you'd say that.

19:46.474 --> 19:48.842
Hey, guys. I'd like to set
the record straight.

19:48.877 --> 19:53.313
I am, in fact, the woman who protested
the admissions recommendation letter.

19:53.348 --> 19:56.617
But I can assure you that I
was nothing more than the victim

19:56.651 --> 19:59.453
of a personal attack
by someone I trusted.

19:59.487 --> 20:04.358
And did not have sex with.
He eventually plead guilty to what he did,

20:04.392 --> 20:07.661
and subsequently said he
would rescind said letter.

20:07.695 --> 20:09.563
So here I am.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.200
And may I remind you,

20:13.234 --> 20:16.103
torts, preponderance
of the evidence.

20:16.137 --> 20:17.971
Ok, thanks.

20:20.308 --> 20:21.675
You know,
I took a summer prep class.

20:21.709 --> 20:24.044
I'm so ready to dive in
and give it a hundred percent.

20:24.078 --> 20:26.814
- So can I join your study group?
- Yeah, no.

20:26.848 --> 20:31.351
- We don't have enough chairs.
- Well, I can bring a chair over.

20:31.386 --> 20:35.489
- Right, Evan? - Yes, she can.
She's very strong.

20:36.724 --> 20:38.425
How well do you
two know each other?

20:38.460 --> 20:40.727
- We used to date.
- Oh, Evan,

20:40.762 --> 20:44.331
- did you work in undergrad admissions?
- Ok, what is your problem?

20:44.365 --> 20:48.435
Our problem is we have 30 cases
to summarize by next week.

20:48.470 --> 20:52.072
We want the best students in the class,
not someone who got in on a technicality.

20:52.106 --> 20:55.342
- I would be a total asset.
- It's taken you...

20:55.376 --> 20:56.877
Don't even go there.

20:58.980 --> 21:02.216
I aced the lsat.
I got better grades than Evan.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.051
I'm just trying
to plead my case.

21:04.085 --> 21:06.353
Well, if you're just trying
to plead your case,

21:06.387 --> 21:08.956
then you should know that
your argument is flawed.

21:08.990 --> 21:10.858
It's totally based on hearsay.

21:10.892 --> 21:14.761
Ok. There's cutthroat, and then
there's just being an ass.

21:15.797 --> 21:17.264
And you are the latter.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.059
Case, wait up.

21:26.094 --> 21:27.728
Thanks for nothing back there.

21:27.762 --> 21:31.064
I'm sorry, but you called me out and
I got caught up in the competition.

21:31.099 --> 21:33.100
You're the one that said
every man for himself.

21:33.134 --> 21:35.202
You had no problem
showing me up in class.

21:35.236 --> 21:37.637
That's when I thought we were
dealing with adults in there.

21:37.672 --> 21:41.641
Law school is worse than the Greek system.
It's like junior high!

21:41.676 --> 21:44.444
"We don't have enough chairs."

21:44.479 --> 21:47.481
Look, maybe the pressure
brings out the worst in us,

21:47.515 --> 21:51.618
but summer jobs and scholarships
are on the line. Especially mine.

21:51.652 --> 21:54.154
Well, at least you
have a study group.

21:54.188 --> 21:57.591
- Forget it, I will think of something.
- Why don't you talk to Segal?

21:57.625 --> 21:59.893
See if he can assign you
to a group or something.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.630
Oh, great, now I'm rusty
in High School.

22:07.668 --> 22:10.804
<i>The meaning of life?
I don't think so.</i>

22:10.838 --> 22:12.672
- It was just a bunch of skits.
- Ok, you're right.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.675
The movie had nothing to do with the
meaning of life or why we're here.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.211
But you totally laughed when
that guy ate until he exploded.

22:18.246 --> 22:21.915
- Cautionary tales are funny.
- Calvin!

22:21.949 --> 22:25.318
- Hey! How are you? You're back.
- Hey!

22:25.353 --> 22:27.454
- Yeah! - Ashleigh, I
haven't talked to you

22:27.488 --> 22:31.091
- since that phone call when you told me I suck.
- And I still think you do.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.693
- Well, good day, then.
- Good day to you.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.796
- So, Calvin...
- I said good day, sir!

22:39.167 --> 22:42.035
Wow. I see you brought some
of that New York edge with you.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.237
- What are you doing back?
- Oh, licking my wounds.

22:44.272 --> 22:48.041
Trying to find someone to play with.
Everyone has boring class.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.445
Hard to believe,
considering we're in college.

22:51.479 --> 22:54.815
I have to finish an assignment.
I'm trying to figure out the meaning of life

22:54.849 --> 22:58.151
- and why I'm here.
- Well, while you're at it,

22:58.186 --> 23:02.089
can you figure out why I'm here, instead of
staying one step ahead of the zeitgeist?

23:02.123 --> 23:05.058
What happened?

23:05.093 --> 23:09.996
I just thought that if I came back
home, everything would be better.

23:10.031 --> 23:14.601
But everyone has something to do.
Even you, figuring out the meaning of life.

23:14.635 --> 23:18.505
- I am purposeless.
- Ooh. I can relate.

23:18.539 --> 23:21.074
Please. You're, like, the most
figured-out person I know.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.910
Thanks.

23:23.945 --> 23:27.280
Um, I think I'm gonna
go home and take a nap.

23:27.315 --> 23:30.717
So, um, have fun examining
your life with cappie.

23:30.751 --> 23:32.819
And I bet he tries
to get you stoned.

23:37.892 --> 23:39.893
Why the hell not?

23:42.964 --> 23:45.866
He called it
a divine institution.

23:45.900 --> 23:49.269
Omega chi? Now, he's
getting his butt branded?

23:49.303 --> 23:53.807
I think Dale wants more than
just tradition and brotherhood.

23:53.841 --> 23:58.278
- I can relate.
- It's week one, spidey. Be patient.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.815
- He wants to meet a girl.
- We'll get you that, too.

24:01.849 --> 24:04.451
- That'd be nice.
- No, I meant Dale.

24:04.485 --> 24:09.923
All we have to do is find him a girl
before Omega chi does and he'll drop out.

24:09.957 --> 24:13.293
- A little divine intervention,
if you will. - I will.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.329
- But how?
- At our murder mystery party!

24:16.364 --> 24:18.665
- Or the...
- Oh, no, come on!

24:18.699 --> 24:22.869
We can have all the tradition and
costumes and crazy fun of a fraternity

24:22.904 --> 24:25.772
right here in a very safe,
controlled environment.

24:25.806 --> 24:27.340
Top it off with
a pretty girl for Dale.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.143
The only question is how
are we gonna get him here?

24:30.178 --> 24:33.180
The answer is by force.

24:40.454 --> 24:42.956
Um, Professor Segal?

24:42.990 --> 24:45.859
Ms. Cartwright.

24:45.893 --> 24:47.360
Could I talk to you
about yesterday?

24:47.395 --> 24:51.298
I wanted to address the rumors
about how I got into cru law.

24:51.332 --> 24:55.168
How you got in is irrelevant.
You're here now. Do your best.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.671
Yes, but I need you
to know that I got in on merit.

24:57.705 --> 25:01.141
And I need to know that the false
things other students say about me

25:01.175 --> 25:03.643
- won't affect the way that you judge me.
- It won't.

25:03.678 --> 25:06.613
Your performance in class
is all that matters.

25:08.249 --> 25:09.849
Great. Um...

25:09.884 --> 25:12.419
But I know that you said
that it's really important

25:12.453 --> 25:14.487
that we get into a study group,
and the other students

25:14.522 --> 25:16.523
have frozen me out because of
this rumor that isn't even true.

25:16.557 --> 25:21.461
- So could you assign me to a group?
- Sure.

25:21.495 --> 25:24.197
Do you want me to make an
announcement in class?

25:24.232 --> 25:27.033
No. Unless you want to.

25:27.068 --> 25:30.036
Sure, I can pick you up
some diapers while I'm at it.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.005
I'm not your nanny,
I'm your law Professor.

25:32.039 --> 25:34.541
How your classmates treat you
is not my concern.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.410
But I didn't do anything wrong.

25:37.445 --> 25:40.747
This is an adversarial
profession, Ms. Cartwright.

25:40.781 --> 25:44.184
How you deal with it will determine
your success or your failure.

25:44.218 --> 25:46.453
Ok?

25:53.928 --> 25:57.530
All right, ladies.
Iron's hot.

25:57.565 --> 26:00.800
We're starting with
your first pledge bro.

26:00.835 --> 26:05.705
As interim president, let me be the
first to welcome you to Omega chi.

26:05.740 --> 26:08.942
Ok. Here we go.

26:08.976 --> 26:11.344
On three.

26:11.379 --> 26:15.515
One, two, three!

26:31.966 --> 26:34.634
Spidey, run interference.
Go, go, go!

26:34.669 --> 26:36.536
Rusty? Ah!

26:37.738 --> 26:40.440
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

26:40.474 --> 26:44.377
The condor is away!
Egress, egress!

26:48.883 --> 26:49.916
Hello.

26:56.873 --> 27:01.744
Ok, you guys
are really freaking me out.

27:07.618 --> 27:11.687
Oh, my gosh!
He looks like a rabbit.

27:11.722 --> 27:13.055
- Who?
- Him.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.557
No, his ears are too short.

27:14.591 --> 27:18.494
He looks like, um, link
from legend of Zelda, you know?

27:18.528 --> 27:21.931
Know what I mean?

27:23.634 --> 27:26.636
Man, I'm so glad we came
around to your idea,

27:26.670 --> 27:30.439
- but, um...
- But what?

27:30.474 --> 27:32.041
- What?
- What?

27:32.075 --> 27:35.211
Was I talking?

27:46.890 --> 27:48.324
- You know what?
- Hm?

27:48.358 --> 27:51.093
I'm gonna explode
like that guy in the movie.

27:53.297 --> 27:57.667
- Oh, man, like a piñata.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

27:57.701 --> 28:01.103
- We gotta do this assignment.
- Oh, right.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.306
- Ok.
- Ok.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.908
- Ok.
- Why am I here?

28:05.942 --> 28:08.611
- Right.
- Why am I here?

28:10.580 --> 28:12.682
Oh, dude.
Oh, my gosh. I got it.

28:12.716 --> 28:15.084
Oh, God, ok.
Listen to this, right?

28:15.118 --> 28:17.486
Ok. How do I say this? Um...

28:17.521 --> 28:21.424
Ok, so basically there's, like, a lot
of reasons, right, why we're here.

28:21.458 --> 28:24.827
But the reasons
are not as important

28:24.861 --> 28:29.498
as the people who ask
the questions, you know?

28:29.533 --> 28:34.170
Like any kid on campus,
or an astronaut.

28:34.204 --> 28:35.604
Or like Rachel ray, man.

28:35.639 --> 28:37.707
Rachel ray!

28:37.741 --> 28:40.609
I mean, we're not...
We don't have the answers.

28:40.644 --> 28:42.945
They do. Not me.

28:42.979 --> 28:44.980
Not me. Not you.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.650
So how can we know
if we're not them?

28:47.684 --> 28:51.253
That... is...

28:51.288 --> 28:52.888
Brilliant.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.359
Yeah, man.

28:57.394 --> 28:58.994
Does that even make sense?

29:05.969 --> 29:08.337
- Oh, I made a mess.
- Oh, no!

29:08.372 --> 29:10.539
You have chips on your butt.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.516
I am lady fuchsia,

29:20.550 --> 29:24.820
and welcome to murder manor, where an
unthinkable deed has just occurred.

29:24.855 --> 29:27.423
And by that I mean... murder!

29:27.457 --> 29:31.927
What? You kidnapped me for this?
I thought this was a kt prank.

29:31.962 --> 29:36.599
- You embarrass yourself, sir.
- Yeah, by attending this nerd coachella.

29:37.934 --> 29:40.136
You embarrass yourself further!

29:40.170 --> 29:42.671
But who did it?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.341
But who did it?

29:46.510 --> 29:47.510
None of us,

29:47.544 --> 29:51.514
lady fuchsia, the sous chef,

29:51.548 --> 29:55.484
not even I, the
esteemed doctor goldenrod,

29:55.519 --> 29:59.522
nor... jockey nantucket red

29:59.556 --> 30:01.857
is above suspicion.

30:03.527 --> 30:06.362
All right. Um, I gotta
get back to the house.

30:08.231 --> 30:10.199
So trip can scar you for life?

30:10.233 --> 30:12.768
- And you think this won't?
- I saved your butt back there.

30:12.803 --> 30:16.038
- Literally. - My butt didn't need saving.
My butt needed an "x" on it.

30:16.072 --> 30:18.073
I know the theme's
kind of lame.

30:18.108 --> 30:19.708
- Yeah.
- Ok.

30:19.743 --> 30:22.978
But Dana's got a friend Molly
here and she wants to meet you.

30:23.013 --> 30:26.248
- Hi. - The one with the
slight but sexy overbite?

30:26.283 --> 30:29.652
Yeah. Just give it an hour..

30:29.686 --> 30:31.487
If you two don't hit it off,
you can leave.

30:31.521 --> 30:34.490
Man, the things
I do for a girl.

30:34.524 --> 30:37.626
Welcome to my world.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.495
Smashing, then!

30:39.529 --> 30:40.830
The game's afoot!

30:42.032 --> 30:43.833
Jockey nantucket red,

30:43.867 --> 30:46.402
I'd like you to meet
chambermaid brown.

30:48.438 --> 30:50.573
Hi. Nantucket.

30:50.607 --> 30:52.408
Chambermaid.

30:57.447 --> 30:59.348
I gotta drop this class.

30:59.382 --> 31:01.851
- Well, you quit easy.
- I can't do it.

31:01.885 --> 31:03.819
Tests and quizzes,
that I can handle.

31:03.854 --> 31:07.723
But examining my life, you know,
trying to find some purpose?

31:07.757 --> 31:10.526
You don't
need this class for your major?

31:12.329 --> 31:14.630
Cappie, what do you
think my major is?

31:14.664 --> 31:18.033
It's, um, business.

31:19.236 --> 31:21.170
No, uh, architecture.

31:21.204 --> 31:24.206
Architectural business...

31:24.241 --> 31:26.842
- ...Relations?
- I don't have a major.

31:26.877 --> 31:29.512
What?
How do I not know this?

31:29.546 --> 31:31.647
No one does,
'cause I don't tell anyone.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.384
'Cause I don't want anyone
to think that I'm like, uh...

31:37.120 --> 31:39.555
Me?

31:39.589 --> 31:43.559
Everyone thinks I'm Mr.
Together, but the truth is,

31:43.593 --> 31:45.728
I have no idea what I'm doing.

31:45.762 --> 31:48.264
So, what makes you happy?

31:49.499 --> 31:51.600
Finally admitting that.

31:51.635 --> 31:55.037
Not having to try so hard to seem
like I've got it all figured out.

31:55.071 --> 31:59.275
Being with heath,
who doesn't even know.

31:59.309 --> 32:03.913
- And what are you afraid of?
- Picking something I hate just to pick.

32:03.947 --> 32:06.949
And then realizing years later
that I have made a huge mistake

32:06.983 --> 32:10.286
that I've screwed up
my entire life.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.756
I guess if you don't pick
anything, eventually,

32:13.790 --> 32:15.791
it'll be too late
to choose any of them.

32:15.825 --> 32:19.094
- Hm.
- So, what do you wanna do?

32:19.129 --> 32:22.765
Honestly, I want to do
something that matters.

32:22.799 --> 32:25.601
Makes the world
a better place. I know.

32:25.635 --> 32:28.437
- It's cheesy and clichéd.
- Yeah.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.874
Uh, hey guys,
have you seen rusty?

32:34.844 --> 32:37.980
No, Cal and I
are just here all day.

32:38.014 --> 32:41.417
Studying. Um...
Why would you need rusty?

32:41.451 --> 32:45.054
Well, the truth is I've been
having a horrible couple of days,

32:45.088 --> 32:49.658
and I'm looking at a hard three-year
sentence of being the law school pariah.

32:49.693 --> 32:51.927
And rusty knows
what that's like.

32:55.265 --> 32:56.932
Wait, are you guys high?

32:56.967 --> 32:59.468
Uh, not anymore.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.504
It was for class, I swear.

33:02.539 --> 33:05.975
Oh, for class.
Of course it was.

33:06.843 --> 33:09.178
Casey, wait up!

33:13.750 --> 33:17.453
So, uh, when you're not cleaning
chamberpots, what's your major?

33:17.487 --> 33:23.292
Applied mathematics.
With a 3.86 repeating gpa.

33:23.326 --> 33:24.927
Wow.

33:24.961 --> 33:28.097
And I do deduce

33:28.131 --> 33:30.532
this one's got
a look of guilt about 'im.

33:30.567 --> 33:35.304
- Have you been a naughty lad?
- Really?

33:35.338 --> 33:38.674
Uh, apparently while
bridling the stallion,

33:38.708 --> 33:43.045
- I heard a commotion in the armory.
- That's the tv area.

33:43.079 --> 33:46.982
And the chambermaid should show you
the clue she found in the hedge maze.

33:47.017 --> 33:50.152
Shall we?

33:50.186 --> 33:52.821
All right. Hour's up,
gold rod. I gotta go.

33:52.856 --> 33:56.859
- But the game's not done.
- Ok. Samir's the killer.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.094
Based on what?

34:00.563 --> 34:03.632
- Racial profiling?
- No, based on common sense.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.734
You're only an assistant chef,
so you're resentful

34:05.769 --> 34:08.337
and your job gives you easy access
to all kinds of murder weapons.

34:08.371 --> 34:10.873
Come on. You nerds
didn't figure this out?

34:10.907 --> 34:14.243
We nerds?
We're your circle, Dale.

34:14.277 --> 34:18.813
We read the same books as you.
We laugh at your chemistry puns.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.315
And don't tell me you'll meet
a girl like Molly at Omega chi.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.853
I hope not. No offense,
but I can do better.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.989
I didn't eat mayonnaise burritos
to date the Molly's of the world.

34:27.023 --> 34:31.126
Wow, ok. You're the
perfect Omega chi after all.

34:31.161 --> 34:36.899
You're snobby, shallow and just way
better than any of us losers, right?

34:36.933 --> 34:39.201
Dale's an Omega chi?

34:41.103 --> 34:44.172
Admit it, you can't accept that
you're no longer the only nerd

34:44.206 --> 34:48.143
- who can fit in and join a fraternity.
- Have you met our new pledge?

34:48.178 --> 34:50.179
Yeah, and where is he?

34:50.213 --> 34:54.216
Maybe you should worry about your own
pledge who you left at Omega chi.

35:02.926 --> 35:06.028
I hate this
school and everyone in it!

35:06.062 --> 35:09.698
Stupid cappie! I thought that
he'd want to change for himself,

35:09.733 --> 35:12.634
but there he was,
baked like a stoner freshman!

35:12.669 --> 35:14.603
I am so stupid
for staying at cru.

35:14.637 --> 35:17.873
Wait, I thought that you stayed
here for yourself and for rusty

35:17.907 --> 35:20.342
- and for the great law program.
- Yeah, yeah, all that crap.

35:20.376 --> 35:23.612
But a little bit for cappie, too,
and that's driving me crazy!

35:23.646 --> 35:27.182
I thought if I stayed,
he'd try, finally. Maybe.

35:27.217 --> 35:29.384
You need to forget about all
that 'cause you're here now.

35:29.419 --> 35:33.088
Well, here, my Professor, who
grades me, thinks I'm a weak bimbo.

35:33.123 --> 35:35.858
And here, my classmates
think that I'm a slut.

35:35.892 --> 35:37.493
I hate here.

35:39.162 --> 35:41.830
Well, then let's go.
I mean, we're adults.

35:41.865 --> 35:44.399
- We can do whatever we want, right?
- No, we can't just leave.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.302
- I can't just go.
- Yeah, you're right.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.075
But what's stopping me?

35:53.109 --> 35:56.545
I'd save my parents
a forte on tuition.

35:56.579 --> 35:59.481
Yeah.
Why not travel for a while?

35:59.516 --> 36:01.583
There's so much
world out there to see!

36:01.618 --> 36:04.787
Then I'll get a congressional
aide job and work my way up.

36:04.821 --> 36:08.357
I'll be in Washington three years early.
I don't even need to be here.

36:08.391 --> 36:10.526
So are we really doing this?

36:10.560 --> 36:13.061
Hell, yes. Pack your bags,
we leave in five!

36:15.131 --> 36:17.065
<i>- All done.
- This is so Thelma & Louise.</i>

36:17.100 --> 36:20.269
Oh, my God!

36:20.303 --> 36:22.104
What if we get
to the grand canyon?

36:23.439 --> 36:25.307
We keep driving.

36:29.148 --> 36:31.282
Oh, no.

36:31.817 --> 36:32.517
Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:33.185 --> 36:37.021
Yeah, that's better.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.757
I guess spider-man
does stick to walls.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.363
Not funny. Ok.

36:49.067 --> 36:50.735
Brace yourself.

36:53.872 --> 36:55.740
- You ass face!
- Ass what?

36:56.742 --> 36:58.509
You're the worst pledge
educator in history, ever!

36:59.411 --> 37:00.511
- Spidey, calm down.
- No, you calm down!

37:01.580 --> 37:03.381
- No, you calm down.
- You forgot me at Omega chi?

37:04.316 --> 37:06.717
I'm sorry. It's terrible
what they did to you.

37:07.286 --> 37:08.519
At least they noticed me.

37:09.855 --> 37:13.658
All you care about is that Dale, who
really wants to be an Omega chi.

37:14.593 --> 37:18.362
I'd kill to be a kt,
even if I wasn't a legacy.

37:21.533 --> 37:25.469
Because I can count on one finger how
many High School parties I went to.

37:26.305 --> 37:28.940
I know I could use
some socialization.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.108
And here you are,
this confident guy

37:31.944 --> 37:32.710
who's an honors
engineering major, too.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.646
You're an honors
engineering major?

37:37.216 --> 37:39.450
I want to be the cool guy
for once in my life.

37:39.985 --> 37:40.651
What's wrong with that?

37:41.553 --> 37:42.520
You know, I wasn't
always this confident.

37:43.422 --> 37:44.855
It's something
that I got from kappa tau.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.057
When's that
gonna happen for me?

37:47.559 --> 37:51.329
We'll discuss it tonight when we're putting
shaving cream on beaver when he sleeps.

37:52.497 --> 37:55.233
It's a little game I like
to call "living dangerously."

37:56.401 --> 37:57.335
Just don't leave me behind.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.337
I promise you, buddy, I won't.

38:00.339 --> 38:02.840
Now, how are we gonna
get you down from here?

38:03.775 --> 38:07.044
You got any WD-40?
It neutralizes the adhesive.

38:07.312 --> 38:09.247
Yeah.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.752
Ok. So say something
about leaving Cyprus.

38:15.354 --> 38:17.555
Um... uh, suck it, Cyprus!

38:18.257 --> 38:20.024
Casey and ashleigh are leaving.

38:20.993 --> 38:22.126
Oh, wait, hold on. Keep going.

38:23.495 --> 38:24.895
- Keep going. - Can you just answer
it so we can get on the road?

38:25.564 --> 38:26.464
No, I can't, 'cause it's faith.

38:27.266 --> 38:28.799
Well, she's not settling
for voicemail.

38:29.868 --> 38:32.069
That's pretty obsessive
for a woman who fired you.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.605
Ok. She didn't fire me.
I left.

38:35.607 --> 38:39.110
- I know, you said you quit.
- No, I just left.

38:44.116 --> 38:46.717
A full-time opening came up,
and faith gave the job

38:47.753 --> 38:50.521
to some talentless reality
wannabe from the outside,

38:51.256 --> 38:51.822
<i>just because she
was on the city.</i>

38:52.758 --> 38:55.426
- Was it Whitney port?
- Missing the point.

38:56.228 --> 38:57.862
- Right.
- I... I went to New York

38:59.064 --> 39:00.765
<i>thinking friends apartment
and sex and the city soirees.</i>

39:01.967 --> 39:06.671
- Yes. - And yes, we both watch
way too much television.

39:07.472 --> 39:10.941
But when I was in my
roach-filled dump

39:11.576 --> 39:13.811
with no friends and no money,

39:14.946 --> 39:17.481
and then you called and said
that you're not coming to dc,

39:18.050 --> 39:20.384
and so even the slim hope

39:21.253 --> 39:24.021
of weekend reunions
on the train was gone.

39:24.523 --> 39:26.190
Ash, I had no idea.

39:27.159 --> 39:30.728
Faith asked me to go
on my thousandth coffee run

39:31.430 --> 39:34.999
and I left
and I never came back.

39:39.237 --> 39:40.338
What if she thinks you're dead?

39:41.239 --> 39:43.274
No, you have to talk to her.

39:44.242 --> 39:47.178
- She's probably worried.
- Oh. Or furious.

39:47.946 --> 39:50.448
You can't run from her forever.

39:54.386 --> 39:56.787
Ok. Ok.

39:59.491 --> 40:00.725
Hi, faith.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.361
Oh, yeah, I'm ok.
I'm sorry.

40:04.663 --> 40:07.264
I just kind of freaked out about
work, and so I came back to Cyprus.

40:07.699 --> 40:10.801
I am so, so sorry.

40:13.405 --> 40:15.039
Yeah, I know.

40:16.108 --> 40:18.209
I know. I'm sor...

40:19.678 --> 40:22.246
Yeah, I know, I'll...

40:24.015 --> 40:26.684
All I can do is apologize.

40:36.194 --> 40:37.561
Now, I'm fired.

40:42.534 --> 40:44.535
We can't go.

40:45.103 --> 40:46.670
We're not kids anymore.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.373
We can't just run away.

40:51.276 --> 40:53.611
We're not Thelma and Louise.

40:55.947 --> 40:58.048
Come here.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.287
Hey, case! Where are
we on those Cheesaritos?

41:04.156 --> 41:06.791
Yes, I am getting you
the Cheesaritos.

41:07.325 --> 41:08.859
Appreciate it.

41:23.341 --> 41:25.476
Beaver caught me putting
shaving cream in his hair.

41:26.611 --> 41:28.379
This is my punishment for not
putting up enough resistance

41:29.214 --> 41:29.747
to your little murder
mystery abduction.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.082
- About earlier...
- Let's just agree to disagree

41:33.785 --> 41:36.487
- about my new affiliation. - I don't want to do that.
I want to be excited for you.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.825
I know this is a 180 for me.
But that doesn't have to be a bad thing, right?

41:41.760 --> 41:43.928
Isn't that why you
joined kappa tau? To change?

41:45.497 --> 41:50.301
I guess it's hard for me to accept because
I don't think you need to change.

41:52.037 --> 41:52.703
I appreciate that.

41:53.405 --> 41:54.572
But I do need
to do this for me.

41:55.740 --> 42:00.110
Just like you need to do this
murder mystery crap for Dana.

42:02.681 --> 42:03.814
Don't worry, pledge.

42:04.883 --> 42:07.918
I know a trick to get
the permanent ink off your face.

42:16.461 --> 42:19.029
I did my own study
notes on all the cases.

42:19.965 --> 42:20.798
I made extra copies,
if anyone wants them.

42:21.566 --> 42:22.600
Don't worry,
I'm not asking to trade.

42:23.268 --> 42:26.103
Oh, no thanks, we're covered.

42:26.905 --> 42:29.006
Let me know
when you're uncovered.

42:29.307 --> 42:30.875
Ok, case.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.911
- What the hell was that?
- What did I do?

42:35.347 --> 42:37.882
Because what? Ow.
Class... beginning.

42:39.050 --> 42:42.119
Before we begin, I have one
brief announcement to make.

42:43.455 --> 42:46.390
We have a newly arrived transfer
student who just got late acceptance

42:46.925 --> 42:48.559
into the jd-mba program.

42:49.194 --> 42:51.395
Please welcome, Ms. Parker.

42:52.898 --> 42:55.136
Didn't you get rejected
from that program?

42:55.561 --> 42:57.905
- Wait. Isn't that...?
- Katherine?

42:58.105 --> 43:00.034
- Hello, Casey! - Hey, if you're
looking for a study group...

43:00.162 --> 43:02.546
Can you not interrupt me while I'm
waving to my friend, thank you.
