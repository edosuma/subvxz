WEBVTT

00:04.124 --> 00:06.753
Okay, this is threaded.
Here, you take this.

00:06.754 --> 00:07.623
Okay.

00:07.624 --> 00:09.043
I got this.
You take this.

00:09.044 --> 00:10.463
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

00:10.464 --> 00:11.463
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

00:11.464 --> 00:12.503
All right, now...

00:12.504 --> 00:13.503
click it in.

00:13.504 --> 00:14.543
Okay, push it.

00:14.544 --> 00:15.543
(straining): I am pushing.

00:15.544 --> 00:16.543
No, push it down.

00:16.544 --> 00:18.575
I am...
pushing it down!

00:18.576 --> 00:20.155
- Okay, I think that's it.
- (seat belt clicks)

00:20.156 --> 00:21.745
- (groans) Okay.
- Okay.

00:21.746 --> 00:22.945
- Let me get mine in.
- Okay.

00:22.946 --> 00:24.745
And tighten her up.

00:24.746 --> 00:25.745
- Good.
- (panting): Like that.

00:25.746 --> 00:27.035
- All right, let me just take...
- Yeah.

00:27.036 --> 00:28.695
- Take up the slack. (groans)
- Okay.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.865
(screams)
You're cutting me in half!

00:31.866 --> 00:32.945
I'm gonna release my sides!

00:32.946 --> 00:34.985
- Ow! Oh.
- Oh.

00:34.986 --> 00:36.325
Oh, Mol!

00:36.326 --> 00:38.326
(panting)

00:41.036 --> 00:43.075
Honey...

00:43.076 --> 00:46.365
can we please just take
this thing to the fire station

00:46.366 --> 00:49.115
where they will
install it for free?

00:49.116 --> 00:51.905
Yeah, maybe they'll do it
for you shirtless, too.

00:51.906 --> 00:53.985
(chuckles) Don't worry.

00:53.986 --> 00:56.905
You're still my first
responder of choice.

00:56.906 --> 00:57.946
Thank you.

00:59.576 --> 01:01.325
You believe it?

01:01.326 --> 01:03.615
Three weeks, we're gonna
have a baby in this thing.

01:03.616 --> 01:05.035
You're gonna be a mom.

01:05.036 --> 01:06.945
You're gonna be a dad.

01:06.946 --> 01:07.945
Mama.

01:07.946 --> 01:09.945
(foreign accent): Papa.

01:09.946 --> 01:11.115
(chuckles)

01:11.116 --> 01:12.945
Okay, well, let's get
this damn car seat in

01:12.946 --> 01:15.985
so Mom and Dad aren't gonna
have to walk baby six miles home

01:15.986 --> 01:18.035
from the hospital.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.905
You know what?

01:19.906 --> 01:23.785
You have been working
really hard on this.

01:23.786 --> 01:25.535
Why don't you just...

01:25.536 --> 01:27.285
go take a nap or something,

01:27.286 --> 01:29.745
and I'll, I'll give
this another shot.

01:29.746 --> 01:31.400
You want to try
to do this alone?

01:33.812 --> 01:35.092
(whispering):
Just go take a nap.

01:37.022 --> 01:39.441
Okay, but don't take it
to Firehouse Seven...

01:39.442 --> 01:40.732
those guys know me.

(phone ringing)

02:18.675 --> 02:20.885
Ugh.

02:33.175 --> 02:35.465
Hello.

02:36.555 --> 02:38.055
Yeah, this is Molly Flynn.

02:39.715 --> 02:44.304
What? No, no, she's not due
for another three weeks.

02:44.305 --> 02:46.094
What?

02:46.095 --> 02:47.384
Oh, my God!

02:47.385 --> 02:49.174
Oh, my God, okay,
we're on our way.

02:49.175 --> 02:50.175
- Mike, get up!
- (groans)

02:53.215 --> 02:54.264
What's going on?

02:54.265 --> 02:55.764
It's go time.
The baby's coming.

02:55.765 --> 02:56.764
Our baby?

02:56.765 --> 02:58.004
Yes, our baby.
Who else's baby?

02:58.005 --> 02:59.094
Come on!

02:59.095 --> 03:01.134
I heard the phone.
What's going on?

03:01.135 --> 03:02.134
The baby's coming.

03:02.135 --> 03:03.134
Wh... your baby?

03:03.135 --> 03:05.264
Yes, my baby. What is the matter
with you people?

03:05.265 --> 03:07.174
- Get dressed.
- Oh, my God.

03:07.175 --> 03:09.095
Well, sure, I'll cut the grass.

03:10.765 --> 03:12.384
What the hell
is he talking about?

03:12.385 --> 03:14.054
He couldn't sleep,
so he took an Ambien.

03:14.055 --> 03:16.004
Well, the van's leaving
in 90 seconds.

03:16.005 --> 03:17.384
Get Magoo ready.

03:17.385 --> 03:19.264
Okay, baby's coming,
baby's coming.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.004
Grandma doesn't like it
when you squeeze the puppy.

03:22.005 --> 03:22.964
Okay.

03:22.965 --> 03:25.715
No more sleeping pills.
Get him dressed!

03:28.055 --> 03:29.174
Victoria!

03:29.175 --> 03:30.464
The baby's coming.

03:30.465 --> 03:33.214
We got to go!
We got to go!

03:33.215 --> 03:34.214
What are you doing?

03:34.215 --> 03:36.214
I'm hungry.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.344
No, there's no time for eating.

03:38.345 --> 03:40.054
Not even a bowl of cereal?

03:40.055 --> 03:41.055
No.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.924
This better not
be another drill.

03:43.925 --> 03:45.384
Hey, do you see
me holding a stopwatch?

03:45.385 --> 03:47.504
This is the real deal.
Let's go.

03:47.505 --> 03:48.504
(exhales sharply)

03:48.505 --> 03:49.505
Baby's coming?

03:51.465 --> 03:54.634
Not you two again.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.004
I would've told you sooner,

03:56.005 --> 03:57.844
but sneaking around behind
your back makes it hotter.

03:57.845 --> 03:59.054
(groans)

03:59.055 --> 04:01.094
Okay, the van's leaving
in 30 seconds.

04:01.095 --> 04:03.175
I've known about this for, like,
two weeks. Let's go!

04:06.765 --> 04:08.004
Oh.

04:08.005 --> 04:09.554
(groans) Take it easy.

04:09.555 --> 04:11.004
I'm getting carsick.

04:11.005 --> 04:13.094
Well, if you'd have had
a bowl of cereal with me,

04:13.095 --> 04:14.844
it would've
settled your stomach.

04:14.845 --> 04:15.885
Don't start.

04:17.595 --> 04:19.673
I'm sure you all got questions
about what's going on

04:19.675 --> 04:21.173
between Victoria and me.

04:21.175 --> 04:23.924
Yeah, that's exactly what
we're all thinking

04:23.925 --> 04:27.094
as we speed to the hospital
to adopt a baby.

04:27.095 --> 04:29.884
Then, to ease your mind,
it's purely sexual.

04:29.885 --> 04:31.054
Mm-hmm. Our kinks just click.

04:31.055 --> 04:32.304
I'm the ying to his Wang.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.464
- (groans)
- MOLLY: Ew.

04:33.465 --> 04:35.134
(breathing heavily)

04:35.135 --> 04:37.054
I really do think
I'm gonna get sick.

04:37.055 --> 04:39.134
Okay, okay, just-just,
uh, breathe, okay?

04:39.135 --> 04:41.054
Take short, shallow breathes.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.054
(breathes rapidly)

04:42.055 --> 04:44.264
- (mimics breathing)
- Good.

04:44.265 --> 04:46.344
You know what?
I-I actually do feel better.

04:46.345 --> 04:48.344
Yeah, it got me through
diarrhea at Disney World.

04:48.345 --> 04:49.924
Ugh!

04:49.925 --> 04:52.554
- (tires screeching)
- Ow. Where are you going?

04:52.555 --> 04:54.214
Stay on Cicero.

04:54.215 --> 04:56.054
She'd kill me if I didn't stop.

04:56.055 --> 04:58.134
Your mother?
There is no time.

04:58.135 --> 04:59.884
If we don't bring her along,

04:59.885 --> 05:03.175
we will hear about it
for the rest of our lives.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.175
Okay, there she is.

05:08.385 --> 05:10.135
(door slides open)

05:11.095 --> 05:12.265
Where am I supposed to sit?

05:13.555 --> 05:15.004
We could take out the baby seat.

05:15.005 --> 05:17.304
BOTH: No!

05:17.305 --> 05:18.805
Oh, for God's sake.

05:24.175 --> 05:27.715
No worse than coach on Delta.

05:32.505 --> 05:33.504
We're here!

05:33.505 --> 05:35.384
We're here.
We're here.

05:35.385 --> 05:37.134
They called us.
We came.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.134
We're here.
What do we do?

05:39.135 --> 05:40.384
I'm gonna need
a little more information.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.634
Okay, okay.

05:41.635 --> 05:45.174
The woman that is having
our baby is having our baby.

05:45.175 --> 05:46.174
(laughs)

05:46.175 --> 05:48.424
Okay, still need a little more.

05:48.425 --> 05:50.504
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, I got it, I got it.

05:50.505 --> 05:53.134
Okay, uh, we are here to meet
our, uh, adoption advocate,

05:53.135 --> 05:55.134
and her name is...

05:55.135 --> 05:57.595
written on a card
on my nightstand!

05:58.595 --> 05:59.764
But you had time for cereal.

05:59.765 --> 06:01.054
- Don't do that right now.
- I'm just saying.

06:01.055 --> 06:02.214
- Don't-don't...
- I'll handle this.

06:02.215 --> 06:03.844
I've got $22 here.

06:03.845 --> 06:07.884
I'll give you $11 now and $11
when you cough up the baby.

06:07.885 --> 06:10.504
That's okay, I just need
a name to work with.

06:10.505 --> 06:12.134
Name, name, Puddin' Tain.

06:12.135 --> 06:13.804
Ask me again
and I'll tell you the same.

06:13.805 --> 06:15.464
Get him out of here!

06:15.465 --> 06:18.424
Are you the Flynn-Biggs family?

06:18.425 --> 06:20.054
Yes. (laughs) That's us.

06:20.055 --> 06:21.594
Nice to meet you,
I'm your adoption advocate.

06:21.595 --> 06:23.134
(sighs) Is the baby here?

06:23.135 --> 06:25.304
Not yet,
but the mother is in labor.

06:25.305 --> 06:26.594
You guys need to stay close

06:26.595 --> 06:27.964
because it could happen
at any minute.

06:27.965 --> 06:29.174
Take this.

06:29.175 --> 06:31.054
It'll buzz and let you know
when we're ready for you.

06:31.055 --> 06:33.134
It's cool, like waiting
for a table at Chili's.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.135
(laughs)

06:35.095 --> 06:37.215
Except it's your child.

06:39.135 --> 06:40.674
This is very exciting.

06:40.675 --> 06:42.004
Thank you so much.

06:42.005 --> 06:43.344
(both chuckle)

06:43.345 --> 06:45.214
If it's a girl, we're gonna
name her after you.

06:45.215 --> 06:47.175
Oh, great.
My name is Blanche.

06:51.385 --> 06:52.924
- Do you have a middle name?
- Okay.

06:52.925 --> 06:54.174
All right, okay.

06:54.175 --> 06:55.465
No, no, no, we're good...

07:08.345 --> 07:10.258
Holy crap.

07:11.385 --> 07:12.965
Where am I?

07:13.659 --> 07:15.965
In the... in the hospital.

07:17.955 --> 07:20.295
Am I going in or being released?

07:23.005 --> 07:25.875
We're waiting for your test
results, it doesn't look good.

07:27.625 --> 07:28.914
I brought fresh bagels.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.454
- Courtesy of Abe's.
- MOLLY: Aw.

07:30.455 --> 07:33.215
Oh, great, did you bring cream
cheese and some fresh fruit?

07:34.045 --> 07:35.075
You're welcome.

07:37.005 --> 07:39.504
Hey, Nana, so glad
you could come.

07:39.505 --> 07:41.874
I wouldn't miss this
for anything.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.294
Here, I brought something
for the baby.

07:44.295 --> 07:46.254
Aw, I love it.
Thank you.

07:46.255 --> 07:47.254
Mm-hmm.

07:47.255 --> 07:48.874
Aw.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.004
These eyes are a choking hazard.

07:50.005 --> 07:52.254
- Get rid of it.
- Mm.

07:52.255 --> 07:54.505
Oh, hell no!

07:56.505 --> 07:58.214
You back with the drama queen?

07:58.215 --> 07:59.214
Yes, I am.

07:59.215 --> 08:00.875
I was talking to her.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.544
Listen, have you thought about
your living arrangements

08:06.545 --> 08:07.954
for after the baby's born?

08:07.955 --> 08:09.834
Well, we figured
the baby would sleep

08:09.835 --> 08:11.124
in our room for a little bit,

08:11.125 --> 08:13.544
and then we'll move him
into the nursery.

08:13.545 --> 08:14.754
Ugh, that'll never work.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.124
You're all on top of
each other over there.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.414
Why don't you move in with me?

08:18.415 --> 08:21.504
I got plenty of room
in my house,

08:21.505 --> 08:24.124
and everyone is sober.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.164
Is that a shot at me?

08:26.165 --> 08:28.544
Oh, good, you were listening.

08:28.545 --> 08:32.953
Listen, sweetheart, at least
my home has some joy in it.

08:32.955 --> 08:35.255
Unlike the house
you currently haunt.

08:36.294 --> 08:37.914
Joy?

08:37.914 --> 08:40.914
You mean pills, pot,
and fornication?

08:40.914 --> 08:44.714
Like raising my baby
at a Sandals resort.

08:44.715 --> 08:48.044
Okay, okay, okay.
We're not moving.

08:48.045 --> 08:51.504
I think what my daughter is
too nice to say is: Butt out.

08:51.505 --> 08:52.504
Mom, stay out of it.

08:52.505 --> 08:54.084
Yeah, stick to what you know:

08:54.085 --> 08:56.955
Orgies and edible underpants.

08:58.795 --> 09:01.124
Keep talking and I'll slap
that Poligrip

09:01.125 --> 09:03.005
right out of your mouth.

09:04.415 --> 09:07.414
Why don't we take this
outside, Red?

09:07.415 --> 09:10.004
Why don't we do this
right here, Whiskers?

09:10.005 --> 09:11.084
Okay.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.504
(yelling and clamoring)

09:13.505 --> 09:15.254
Snap you like a string bean!

09:15.255 --> 09:17.504
- Enough, enough!
- (yelling stops)

09:17.505 --> 09:18.874
God.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.124
You guys don't stop it,
I will lock that baby up,

09:21.125 --> 09:22.664
and none of you
will ever see it.

09:22.665 --> 09:24.004
(clears throat)

09:24.005 --> 09:25.834
Hey!

09:25.835 --> 09:27.544
Hey.

09:27.545 --> 09:29.044
Hey, Blanche.

09:29.045 --> 09:33.004
Blanchey-Blanche.
Big B!

09:33.005 --> 09:34.954
Hey.

09:34.955 --> 09:35.954
Do you want a bagel?

09:46.194 --> 09:47.533
Is everything okay in here?

09:47.534 --> 09:49.113
Oh, yeah.

09:49.114 --> 09:51.783
It's great, we're just
playing a lively game of...

09:51.784 --> 09:53.088
pass the grandma.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.175
- I win!
- ALL: Yay!

09:58.494 --> 10:00.993
Yeah, were just, uh,
very anxious for some news.

10:00.994 --> 10:02.243
Well, the mother
is still in labor

10:02.244 --> 10:04.073
and it looks like it's
going to be a while.

10:04.074 --> 10:08.073
I'd normally say, "Just keep
doing what you're doing," but...

10:08.074 --> 10:09.693
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.

10:09.694 --> 10:11.094
We're just, you know,
blowing off...

10:12.059 --> 10:14.098
steam and having...

10:14.099 --> 10:16.308
having fun.
We're good.

10:16.309 --> 10:18.308
Okay, well, I'll check back
in a little bit.

10:18.309 --> 10:22.099
You know, the name Blanche is
really starting to grow on us.

10:26.929 --> 10:28.468
MIKE:
You guys better straighten up.

10:28.469 --> 10:30.639
(all arguing)

10:39.019 --> 10:41.558
(sighs)

10:41.559 --> 10:42.848
What are you doing out here?

10:42.849 --> 10:44.639
Taking a break
from my loved ones.

10:46.429 --> 10:47.558
- (all arguing)
- Yeah, I don't know

10:47.559 --> 10:48.888
what you were thinking,
bringing us all here.

10:48.889 --> 10:50.468
(chuckles)

10:50.469 --> 10:53.388
Okay, so look, I got your mom
settled in the cafeteria.

10:53.389 --> 10:57.138
Jell-O seemed to soothe
that savage beast.

10:57.139 --> 10:58.058
Thanks, pal.

10:58.059 --> 10:59.348
Oh. Here.

10:59.349 --> 11:01.758
Got you some cigars
so you can hand them out.

11:01.759 --> 11:03.138
(chuckles)

11:03.139 --> 11:04.638
Yeah, the guy at the gift shop
said they were Cuban,

11:04.639 --> 11:05.678
but I don't believe him.

11:05.679 --> 11:08.678
They're perfect.
Thanks, buddy.

11:08.679 --> 11:10.098
I appreciate it.

11:10.099 --> 11:11.218
In fact,

11:11.219 --> 11:13.218
I appreciate
everything you've done.

11:13.219 --> 11:14.559
You're very welcome.

11:16.059 --> 11:17.888
You've been with me
every step of the way.

11:17.889 --> 11:18.888
Mm-hmm.

11:18.889 --> 11:20.348
When I met Molly,

11:20.349 --> 11:22.558
when we got married,

11:22.559 --> 11:24.388
and now that I'm about
to become a dad.

11:24.389 --> 11:25.429
(soft chuckle)

11:26.679 --> 11:28.139
- How about that?
- (chuckles)

11:29.259 --> 11:33.178
I could not ask
for a better friend

11:33.179 --> 11:35.518
or a better partner.

11:35.519 --> 11:37.258
And, oh,

11:37.259 --> 11:41.154
Molly and I would like you to
be the godfather of our child.

11:47.809 --> 11:50.058
Man, I'd be honored.

11:50.059 --> 11:52.138
Hey, you know I'd do
anything for that baby, right?

11:52.139 --> 11:55.348
Oh, I don't doubt
that for a second.

11:55.349 --> 11:58.178
I love you, Carl.

11:58.179 --> 11:59.178
I know.

12:09.059 --> 12:10.559
You're not gonna say it back?

12:11.969 --> 12:13.058
Now you know how it feels.

12:13.059 --> 12:15.396
- Oh, come on.
- (laughs)

12:19.139 --> 12:20.179
(babies cooing)

12:22.259 --> 12:25.968
Since they can't hear us, which one
do you think is the cutest?

12:25.969 --> 12:27.348
All of them.

12:27.349 --> 12:29.098
I want to take all of them home.

12:29.099 --> 12:32.888
I mean, this is why
I can't go into animal shelters.

12:32.889 --> 12:34.968
It's hard to believe
that you're gonna have a baby

12:34.969 --> 12:37.428
of your own soon.

12:37.429 --> 12:38.468
I feel...

12:38.469 --> 12:40.058
I feel completely...

12:40.059 --> 12:42.058
ready and...

12:42.059 --> 12:44.848
totally unprepared
all at the same time.

12:44.849 --> 12:47.258
And nauseous. Ooh.

12:47.259 --> 12:49.058
(breathing heavily):
I think that the butterflies

12:49.059 --> 12:52.968
are actually caught
in the knots in my stomach.

12:52.969 --> 12:55.678
Honey, what are you
worried about?

12:55.679 --> 12:58.598
You're gonna be the best mom.

12:58.599 --> 13:00.179
God, I hope so.

13:00.969 --> 13:01.969
I know so.

13:04.059 --> 13:05.848
And if it ever gets too much,

13:05.849 --> 13:08.058
I'm gonna be there for you.

13:08.059 --> 13:10.138
Except weekends.

13:10.139 --> 13:11.758
And mornings.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.468
- Other than that, I'm there for you.
- (chuckles)

13:13.469 --> 13:15.468
Okay.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:17.809 --> 13:19.598
I apologize

13:19.599 --> 13:22.018
for flying off the handle
at Peggy like that.

13:22.019 --> 13:23.558
This is your day.

13:23.559 --> 13:24.558
Thank you.

13:24.559 --> 13:26.098
But her day is coming.

13:26.099 --> 13:28.348
Mom!

13:28.349 --> 13:29.348
Sorry, sorry.

13:29.349 --> 13:31.058
From now on,
I'm on my best behavior.

13:31.059 --> 13:33.098
Good, 'cause I need you here.

13:33.099 --> 13:35.518
I wasn't prepared

13:35.519 --> 13:36.678
for all this waiting.

13:36.679 --> 13:38.348
I mean, first thing
I'm gonna teach this kid

13:38.349 --> 13:39.558
is the importance
of being on time.

13:39.559 --> 13:41.428
Well, some babies are stubborn.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.678
You sure were.

13:42.679 --> 13:45.098
Ugh. 22 hours of labor.

13:45.099 --> 13:46.678
(scoffs) I don't know
how many times

13:46.679 --> 13:49.468
I waddled down that hallway,
had a cigarette,

13:49.469 --> 13:52.468
went back to the room,
waiting for you to arrive.

13:52.469 --> 13:54.138
- (chuckling): Okay.
- Oh, God.

13:54.139 --> 13:54.968
What about me?

13:54.969 --> 13:56.889
You shot out like a bad clam.

13:58.139 --> 14:01.138
I just want
all this waiting to be over,

14:01.139 --> 14:02.758
I want to take
that little baby home,

14:02.759 --> 14:04.558
and I just want
to stop worrying.

14:04.559 --> 14:05.558
(chuckling): Oh.

14:05.559 --> 14:08.138
My sweet, naive girl, you...

14:08.139 --> 14:09.968
You're gonna be a mom.

14:09.969 --> 14:13.468
You got a lifetime of
worrying ahead of you.

14:13.469 --> 14:15.718
When they learn to walk,
learn to drive...

14:15.719 --> 14:18.968
date a cop.

14:18.969 --> 14:21.388
You got to admit, that one
turned out pretty good.

14:21.389 --> 14:24.929
That one turned out great.

14:28.559 --> 14:29.968
So, Victoria.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.178
You next?

14:32.179 --> 14:33.308
Oh, God, no.

14:33.309 --> 14:35.098
I don't think
I ever want a baby.

14:35.099 --> 14:36.518
Mm.

14:36.519 --> 14:38.718
Good luck.

14:38.719 --> 14:40.349
That's exactly what I said.

14:42.929 --> 14:45.018
I mean, Victoria and I said
we were keeping it casual,

14:45.019 --> 14:48.138
but I'd be a liar if I didn't
admit some of those old feelings

14:48.139 --> 14:49.468
were starting to resurface.

14:49.469 --> 14:52.719
I'd be a liar
if I said I was listening.

14:53.889 --> 14:54.888
Hey, how's it going?

14:54.889 --> 14:56.678
Hey, great.

14:56.679 --> 14:59.389
(chuckling): It's a miracle
you're a nice person.

15:00.929 --> 15:02.178
Ma, listen.

15:02.179 --> 15:05.018
You don't have to say
anything, I get it.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.518
Thank you.

15:06.519 --> 15:09.639
Once again, you chose
that family over your own mother.

15:11.349 --> 15:13.928
All I ask is, when the baby's
old enough to understand death,

15:13.929 --> 15:15.098
you show him my headstone.

15:15.099 --> 15:17.468
Don't be ridiculous.

15:17.469 --> 15:20.468
So you won't even
do that for me?

15:20.469 --> 15:22.468
Why are you being like this?

15:22.469 --> 15:24.308
You're about to be a grandma.

15:24.309 --> 15:25.968
Isn't it something
even you can enjoy?

15:25.969 --> 15:27.138
For how long?

15:27.139 --> 15:29.058
Once you get
the baby in that house,

15:29.059 --> 15:30.638
I'll never get to see it again.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.308
That is not true.
Why would you even think that?

15:33.309 --> 15:36.258
'Cause I know how I am.

15:36.259 --> 15:37.928
I'm a lot to take, Mikey.

15:37.929 --> 15:41.060
You don't see it
because you're my son.

15:45.139 --> 15:48.678
I know I'm gonna say something
awful to your wife's family,

15:48.679 --> 15:52.558
(voice breaking): And then
they won't let me see my grandchild.

15:52.559 --> 15:53.848
Ma,

15:53.849 --> 15:55.598
there is nothing

15:55.599 --> 16:00.308
that you could say or do that's
gonna keep you from that baby.

16:00.309 --> 16:02.428
You promise?

16:02.429 --> 16:05.259
Yes, but please don't
take that as a challenge.

16:06.639 --> 16:07.718
(buzzing)

16:07.719 --> 16:09.098
(sniffles) Oh.

16:09.099 --> 16:10.598
Is that your phone?

16:10.599 --> 16:12.518
Oh.
It's happening.

16:12.519 --> 16:15.138
Our table's ready!
I mean, the baby's ready!

16:15.139 --> 16:16.968
Go get your wife.

16:16.969 --> 16:19.138
Run, Mikey, run!

16:19.139 --> 16:22.179
Molly!

16:24.099 --> 16:28.139
Molly! Molly!
Molly!

16:28.969 --> 16:32.018
Molly!
Mol!

16:32.019 --> 16:33.018
Hey, stranger.

16:33.019 --> 16:34.638
Hey, Harry.
Have you seen Molly?

16:34.639 --> 16:35.928
Sure did.
In the gift shop.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.058
Got it.
Gift shop, okay.

16:37.059 --> 16:38.058
Uh, no, no, no.

16:38.059 --> 16:40.099
She <i>was</i> in the gift shop.

16:41.179 --> 16:44.098
Where is she now?

16:44.099 --> 16:45.388
- It's kind of a funny story...
- Where?

16:45.389 --> 16:47.138
- Uh, she's in the bathroom.
- Oh.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.018
Mol.

16:48.019 --> 16:49.098
Mike.

16:49.099 --> 16:50.968
The baby's here.
The baby's here.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.018
Oh, my God.

16:52.019 --> 16:53.019
Oh, my God.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.558
(panting): Where's Mikey?

16:56.559 --> 16:58.178
It's kind of a funny story.

16:58.179 --> 16:59.179
Idiot.

17:01.469 --> 17:03.428
I'm just saying,
it's not just me

17:03.429 --> 17:05.387
that's the godfather
to this child.

17:05.388 --> 17:09.178
You know, I have the title
and it's very prestigious.

17:09.179 --> 17:11.218
But we're all
in this together, you know?

17:11.219 --> 17:13.058
So we got to come together
as a team,

17:13.059 --> 17:14.637
behave like adults,

17:14.638 --> 17:17.808
and support Mike and Molly in
this new chapter of their life.

17:17.809 --> 17:19.308
But remember, as godfather,

17:19.309 --> 17:21.848
you got to run
all that by me first.

17:21.848 --> 17:25.178
He just keeps talking.

17:25.179 --> 17:26.428
Since he was eight months old.

17:26.429 --> 17:29.468
His first word was a paragraph.

17:29.469 --> 17:32.928
I don't want to make
a big deal of it,

17:32.929 --> 17:35.518
but the baby and I have
the same birthday.

17:35.519 --> 17:37.099
Oh, happy birthday.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.718
Can I have a balloon?

17:39.719 --> 17:40.969
No.

17:44.219 --> 17:45.718
Thank you, Joyce.

17:45.719 --> 17:47.178
Hmm?
For what?

17:47.179 --> 17:48.308
For taking this stray dog in

17:48.309 --> 17:50.638
and making him a part
of this crazy family.

17:50.639 --> 17:52.808
Aw, Vince.

17:52.809 --> 17:55.018
I don't know if it's
a compliment or an insult,

17:55.019 --> 17:56.518
but you fit right in.

17:56.519 --> 17:58.099
(chuckles)

18:01.639 --> 18:02.758
Look what we found.

18:02.759 --> 18:04.018
(chuckles)

18:04.019 --> 18:06.138
I'd like to present

18:06.139 --> 18:09.178
William Michael Biggs.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.388
(inhales, sniffles)

18:10.389 --> 18:12.058
Look at our grandson.

18:12.059 --> 18:14.889
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

18:17.059 --> 18:18.848
I was wrong.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.178
I do want one of those.

18:21.179 --> 18:23.968
I'm glad to hear it because
you're gonna be his godmother.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.258
- (gasps)
- And I am gonna need you

18:25.259 --> 18:27.139
on weekends and mornings.

18:28.719 --> 18:30.178
Oh.
I got to...

18:30.179 --> 18:32.178
- I got to sit down.
- Oh, okay, okay.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.098
You okay, sweetie?

18:33.099 --> 18:34.599
Yeah.

18:35.219 --> 18:36.678
Well, I mean...

18:36.679 --> 18:37.968
You know how you
hear those stories

18:37.969 --> 18:41.928
about people
that can't have a baby

18:41.929 --> 18:43.718
and then they end up adopting.

18:43.719 --> 18:47.098
Once all the pressure is
kind of off of them,

18:47.099 --> 18:50.519
they end up getting pregnant.

18:52.099 --> 18:54.388
- No.
- (chuckling): Yeah.

18:54.389 --> 18:55.388
I'm pregnant.

18:55.389 --> 18:58.019
(all cheering and laughing)

19:01.139 --> 19:03.178
I've been feeling
so nauseous lately,

19:03.179 --> 19:05.808
and I thought
it was just nerves.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.428
And then I went downstairs

19:07.429 --> 19:10.098
and I got a te-test
from the pharmacy.

19:10.099 --> 19:12.059
- (sniffles) Yeah.
- JOYCE: Oh, God.

19:14.179 --> 19:16.719
Oh, God, we're gonna have
to put in another car seat.

19:27.093 --> 19:28.093
(baby coos)

19:39.852 --> 19:42.111
Mol, it's 2:00 a.m.

19:42.112 --> 19:43.112
(whispering): Already?

19:44.232 --> 19:46.481
- (gasps)
- You can't do this every night.

19:46.482 --> 19:48.942
(whispering): But I want to.

19:52.402 --> 19:53.981
Come on.
You're pregnant.

19:53.982 --> 19:55.442
You need to get your sleep.

19:56.982 --> 19:58.442
I like watching him.

20:00.062 --> 20:04.191
Oh. I can't believe
all this is happening.

20:04.192 --> 20:05.241
I can.

20:06.982 --> 20:10.191
I've known it since
the first time I saw you.

20:10.192 --> 20:11.982
- (softly): Mike.
- I'm serious.

20:13.692 --> 20:16.231
I said, "That is the woman
I am going to marry

20:16.232 --> 20:18.462
and spend the rest
of my life with."

20:19.812 --> 20:22.062
What about the cramped house
full of mental patients?

20:23.522 --> 20:25.062
That I didn't see coming.

20:26.902 --> 20:28.232
But I wouldn't change a thing.

20:30.022 --> 20:32.021
(softly): Not a thing.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.562
- I love you.
- I love you.

20:36.022 --> 20:38.271
(baby fusses)

20:38.272 --> 20:39.271
Oh.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.852
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
