all over this country club again

How much money do you think
we're gonna make tonight?
A lot.

the water, the sooner
we can get out of here.

to go in the water? How come
you never have to go --

01:04.765 --> 01:07.499
The last time I went in, you
pulled me out four times 'cause
you thought you heard something,

01:15.276 --> 01:17.009
Nothing's
going to happen to me.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.687
No criminal record,
but two weeks ago,

He filed a fraud complaint

of his friends,

Saying they were cheated out
of $2 million by a scam artist.

has the victim been dead?

report Friday night

When mr. Dietz didn't
make it home for dinner.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.965
Did we drop the ball here
at all?

No. We followed policy.

uh, inform the captain

06:25.219 --> 06:26.651
About
the fraud complaint?

06:28.154 --> 06:31.823
Uh, mr. Dietz, his wife,
and some friends

06:31.825 --> 06:34.559
Pooled about $2 million into
their own little mutual fund.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.329
Mr. Dietz was in charge
of investing that money,

06:37.331 --> 06:38.397
And he lost it.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.499
And how is that fraud?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.334
Tao: First of all,
let me explain the difference

06:42.336 --> 06:45.937
Between asset management
and venture capital.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.574
No, no, no, no, no!
We are <i>not</i> doing that.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.376
Oh,
but to fully grasp --

06:51.378 --> 06:53.678
Mike, this is not
a financial seminar.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.947
How did our victim lose
the $2 million

06:55.949 --> 06:58.383
That he and his friends
invested? Period.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.786
Mr. Dietz sold
all his stocks and bonds

07:00.788 --> 07:03.455
And bought a 49% interest
in a brand-new app

07:03.457 --> 07:05.524
That turned out to be
vaporware.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.059
Vaporware --
why do I know that term?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.962
Whenever a fantastic new
computer program is announced

07:10.964 --> 07:12.731
But never makes it
to market,

07:12.733 --> 07:13.799
All the money that went
into developing it --

07:13.801 --> 07:15.867
Vaporizes, that's right.
Mm-hmm.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.204
So, mr. Dietz traded his cow
for magic beans.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.139
Flynn,
are you following this?

07:21.141 --> 07:24.042
Yeah. Yeah.
Magic beans.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.745
But mr. Dietz was trying
to make up for his losses.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.948
How?
By cashing out a trust fund
left to him by his father

07:29.950 --> 07:32.384
And taking $500,000

07:32.386 --> 07:34.719
To gamble at
the blackjack tables in vegas.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.055
Vegas?
When the victim
didn't check in to his hotel,

07:37.057 --> 07:40.492
His wife also tried filing
a missing-persons report
with las vegas metro.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.627
They told her to try back
in a few days,

07:42.629 --> 07:45.664
So she drove to vegas
herself and started hunting
through casinos for him.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.834
Where did the original
$2 million from the mutual fund

07:48.836 --> 07:50.135
Come from?
Sanchez: Ma'am...

07:50.137 --> 07:51.736
According
to the fraud complaint,

07:51.738 --> 07:54.840
Dietz's investors
were his wife, aubrey,

07:54.842 --> 07:57.943
Her brother, charles mason,
a dermatologist...

07:57.945 --> 08:01.313
Has a house three blocks away
near the same golf course.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.981
...His college roommate,
rick marlowe...

08:02.983 --> 08:04.316
Also lives
in the neighborhood.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.419
Also a member
of the country club.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.354
...And their contractor,
barry lawrence,

08:09.356 --> 08:10.956
Who remodeled
all their homes.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.624
Broke his leg and his knee
two weeks ago.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.526
So that would make it
very difficult for him

08:14.528 --> 08:16.761
To get around
a water hazard.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.197
Add in geoff klein,

08:19.199 --> 08:20.832
The scam artist
that developed the vaporware

08:20.834 --> 08:23.702
And who mr. Dietz gave
all their money to,

08:23.704 --> 08:26.304
And jason dietz,
the victim's son,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.306
Whose college fund was lost,
as well.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.709
And we have an olympic-sized
suspect pool.
[ chuckles ]

08:30.711 --> 08:33.445
Flynn: You know
what it sounds like to me?

08:33.447 --> 08:36.181
It sounds like our victim
accidentally screwed

08:36.183 --> 08:37.849
His family and friends,

08:37.851 --> 08:41.286
Got overly desperate
to fix things,

08:41.288 --> 08:44.155
And ended up murdered
for his $500,000.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.224
Provenza: Great, flynn. You've
caught up with the rest of us.

08:46.226 --> 08:50.829
So, to review,
our primary suspects seem to be

08:50.831 --> 08:56.701
Sonny, techie, limpy,
roomie, wifey, and doc.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.737
Should we notify the family,
see how they react?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.906
Yes. But before we do,

09:00.908 --> 09:04.175
Considering there's $500,000
still unaccounted for,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.578
I think it's time
we finally followed up

On the missing-persons

And now, when the police
finally start looking for him,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.525
It's at his own house.

But when your brother-in-law
disappeared,

09:26.433 --> 09:29.834
He had $500,000 on him.
Don't you think we've already
looked for that money?

We've been over every
square inch of this house.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.239
And the yard.
And the garage.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.008
Dad must have taken the cash
with him. Damn it.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.245
He's probably in brazil
by now.
Hey. I've known dennis
since we were 18.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.681
He may not be the savviest guy
on earth, but he would never

09:42.683 --> 09:46.084
Leave us hanging
like that.
Oh, my god! Rick, how can you
go on defending him?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.620
I told you we should
have never given him
control of the money,

09:48.622 --> 09:50.188
And now look
what's happened.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.757
His father was a stock broker.

Oh, his father
was a broker?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.594
If his father
was a dermatologist,

Would you let the idiot do
your botox injections?

Dennis isn't an idiot, chuck.
He's -- he's just trusting.

10:01.535 --> 10:05.403

and maybe even hurt him, too.

into splitting

and drove away.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.600

that dennis was missing?

10:35.602 --> 10:37.969

when he never came home.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.404
Then he quit answering

before.

to the hotel

And the vegas police said
they couldn't help me, either,

the money, too.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.013
Oh, my god.
What is going on?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.848
Why do we
have to sit down?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.185
Look, you people need to be
looking for dad extra-hard --

11:27.187 --> 11:29.854

Yeah.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.258

about that, jason.

And his golf bag's missing
a nine iron.
Sykes:
His cellphone isn't here.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.013
They do have a golf
cart in the garage,
but it's sparkly clean.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.015
Of course it is.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.651
Country club security sent me
a video file of mr. Dietz

Getting ahold of the phone
and the car won't hurt.

12:15.669 --> 12:19.104
But to find the killer,
we need to find the money.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.006
And we are not the only ones

"scammy"
instead of "techie"?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.464
Naming him techie
is derogatory to those of us --

13:19.466 --> 13:23.101
You can call him "guilty"
if you can find him and put
a golf club in his hand.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.337
Scammy is not at his
house, and his office
address is a p.O. Box.

And I've got a broadcast out
on his car.

Well, actually,
since I met doc,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.611
I think of him
more as "grumpy."

He may have been the last person
to see our victim alive.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.625
I'm not talking
about this murder.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.328
I am talking about the trial
of phillip stroh

13:53.767 --> 13:55.500
Without
my permission.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.335
Do you not realize
this is all discoverable,

13:57.337 --> 14:00.505
That the defense will now be
able to accuse rusty

Of mental instability?

that I saw a shrink?
It's nothing.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.716
The defense brings up
bullshit like this all the time.

Everyone here has been
to a psychiatrist.

[ inhales deeply ]
I'm seeing, um, a counselor

14:39.679 --> 14:41.913
Because I'm trying to make
things up with my family.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.382
And while I was doing that,
I sort of lied to my ex-wife.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.251
Why would you lie
to your ex?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.153
I don't know.
Force of habit? All right.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.389
After I brought sharon
to nicole's wedding,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.892
Everybody started asking
about her.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.261
So, maybe I let my ex think,
like,

14:56.263 --> 14:58.496
I was a little closer to sharon
than I really am.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.865
And now my whole family
wants me to bring sharon --

15:00.867 --> 15:02.767
Stop calling her that.

15:02.769 --> 15:06.337
What? That's her name.
What?

15:06.339 --> 15:10.074
Emma:
So, lieutenant, you proposed
placing my witness on the street

15:10.076 --> 15:12.911
In a police operation as bait
without my permission.

15:12.913 --> 15:17.215
That's what this
psych evaluation is all about?
Emma feels left out
of the loop.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.018
When it comes to the trial
of phillip stroh, I <i>am</i> the loop,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.053
And if you are endangering
the life of my witness --

15:22.055 --> 15:23.588
If you really cared
about me,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.623
You would have made a deal
with stroh a long time ago.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.126
That's a valid point.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.962
I have l.A.P.D. Officers
camped outside my condo
and my building 24/7.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.563

and his.

above and beyond

Trying to find this boy
a safe place to live.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.603
Look, you don't want to sweat
the psych evaluation.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.439
You want to stop worrying
that we'll somehow lose the kid

15:41.441 --> 15:43.308
In an s.I.S. Operation --

15:43.310 --> 15:45.143

never happened before

15:45.145 --> 15:46.577
In the history
of this department --

15:46.579 --> 15:48.713
It's easy.

15:48.715 --> 15:53.151
End the stroh case right now
by taking death off the table.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.586
Again, that is not
my decision, lieutenant.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.455

is necessary,

should happen to rusty --

16:16.443 --> 16:18.142
You couldn't care less
about me,

to stop me from seeing a doctor,

you are doing right now.

What?! What?!
Did you not hear us?

22:07.860 --> 22:10.528
I'm running.
Let's go. Go. Set up.
Go, go!

22:10.530 --> 22:12.363
Set up!
The guy wants to talk.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.768
Okay, now you can admit
everything.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.571
But first, we need you
to identify yourself.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.641
Um...Hi.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.976
Uh, m-my name is barry lawrence.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.779

Rusty:
Is your murder over yet?
Sharon: Not really.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
I have a confession
I can't corroborate.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.203
We served search warrants
to all of our suspects,

22:52.205 --> 22:56.340
And none of them has the
$500,000 I'm looking for. Why?

22:56.342 --> 22:59.744
Okay, um,
when my evaluation is over,

22:59.746 --> 23:02.380
Is everyone really going to
read it? I mean, really?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.081
And -- and emma, too?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.316
Especially emma.
[ sighs ]

23:05.318 --> 23:07.051
She'll need to
figure out a way

23:07.053 --> 23:08.753
To keep it from coming up
at trial.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.755
B-but I thought
everything I said to dr. Joe

23:10.757 --> 23:12.223
Was, like, private.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.725
The specific details
that you give him,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.727
Of course,
will remain confidential,

23:16.729 --> 23:20.731
But the evaluation will be
a one- or two-paragraph summary

23:20.733 --> 23:23.200
Of the doctor's
conclusions.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.603
Okay, b-b-but why does
there have to be a summary?

23:25.605 --> 23:28.506
Well, how else
is chief taylor

23:28.508 --> 23:29.940
Gonna sign off
on your participation,

23:29.942 --> 23:32.209
And how am I supposed to give
my informed consent?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.611
Wait, <i>you</i> get to read
the summary, too?

23:33.613 --> 23:35.846
Are you kidding me?!

23:35.848 --> 23:39.083
I'll show it to you, rusty.
There's nothing to worry about.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.920
In fact, the results
of the personality test

I don't see how.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.126
Well, for example,
have you figured out

23:49.128 --> 23:53.130
What you're going to be
when you grow up?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.900
A witness, obviously,

23:55.902 --> 23:59.537
Because this trial is going to
last the rest of my life.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.373
I can't believe how unfair
all of this is, sharon.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.375
Will complaining
make it easier?

24:04.377 --> 24:06.777
I knew you would say something
like that, sharon. I knew it.

yes. Lieutenant?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.715

for a partial confession.

24:11.717 --> 24:12.883
To murder?

No.
To what? Dumping the body?

24:15.455 --> 24:17.755
Uh...No.
Okay.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.758
Is limpy going to tell us
where the money is?

24:20.760 --> 24:23.127
I'm afraid not.
All right,
what is he confessing to?

24:23.129 --> 24:26.330
Well, he's hired madeline morgan
as his lawyer,

24:26.332 --> 24:28.566
And she has
generously offered

24:28.568 --> 24:31.569
To have her client plead
guilty to assault,

24:31.571 --> 24:34.171
Reducible
to misdemeanor battery.

24:34.173 --> 24:38.175
What world
is madeline morgan living in?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.077
Her client confessed.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.112
Eh...
But then he didn't.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.981
I'll be right there.

24:46.486 --> 24:50.855
Well, I don't know
if limpy has an alibi,

24:50.857 --> 24:52.456
But he has no mobility.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.991
Guy can't even drive his own
car, much less the victim's.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.493
But our victim was small.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.462
If he rolled him up in that --
that big drop cloth --

24:58.464 --> 25:00.965
Like contractors use.
He redid all their homes,
though.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.335
Any one of them could have
dragged the poor guy around
in the golf cart, even limpy.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.769
Yeah.
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.511
The music's famous,

are professionals.

What? Oh, god. God, no!

25:18.050 --> 25:20.017

I'm not asking <i>you.</i>

25:20.019 --> 25:21.852
[ sighs ]
look, I was wondering

25:21.854 --> 25:24.688
Because nicole's kind of
expecting me to bring her.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.690
If I ask the captain
to come with me tomorrow,

25:26.692 --> 25:30.194
Do you think she would take it
the wrong way?

25:32.297 --> 25:33.697
Probably not.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.534
But if you have
an extra ticket,

25:36.536 --> 25:38.903
Who you should really bring
along is your psychiatrist

25:38.905 --> 25:42.206
So he could ask you, "what
the hell are you thinking?"

25:42.208 --> 25:44.875
Now, is that
our suspect's financials?

25:52.852 --> 25:55.920
A bit of a cash-flow problem,
mr. Lawrence,

25:55.922 --> 25:57.321
And you've already told us
what happened.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.757
His bank account
isn't the issue here,

25:59.759 --> 26:02.760
And don't even bother bringing
up excited utterances and
spontaneous statements.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.262
He was surrounded by
l.A.P.D. Detectives
pointing guns at him.

hiding under his bed, ma'am.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.068
How was he to know
you were really police?

Because you were running around
shouting "l.A.P.D."

on you from where we sit.

How? Your client said
he beat up the victim

26:24.517 --> 26:26.417
Because he wanted his money.
He said, "I did it."

trouble. Why should you care?

26:29.522 --> 26:32.089

Is that the vaporware guy?

<i>with one crutch.</i>

<i>Please, be quiet</i>
<i>until I tell you otherwise.</i>
<i>Tao, is he talking</i>
<i>about techie?</i>

26:34.627 --> 26:37.861

that's why they can't
find geoff anywhere.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.863
The guy's dead.

26:39.865 --> 26:43.467
So, you don't know where
geoff's body is. Is that it?

26:43.469 --> 26:46.036
"geoff's body"?
What does that mean?

26:46.038 --> 26:47.538
And where is rios going
with my deal?

parked down the street

27:06.993 --> 27:08.559
When I've come here to deal
in good faith,

27:08.561 --> 27:11.295
Especially considering
klein is as alive as I am

27:11.297 --> 27:14.131
And doesn't
want to press charges.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.966
This other murder --
out of the blue.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.402
I understand.
Let me ask barry two questions.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.137
If I can verify
his response,

27:20.139 --> 27:23.340
Then I will let
your client go.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.775
What are your questions?

27:24.777 --> 27:27.177
Mr. Lawrence,
where were you Friday night

27:27.179 --> 27:29.580
Between the hours of 7:00 p.M.
And midnight?

27:29.582 --> 27:34.585
And if geoff klein
is still alive, where is he?

27:34.587 --> 27:38.956
My client's answers should be
considered hypothetical

27:38.958 --> 27:40.791
Until you keep your word.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.427
So don't think you can
use anything that he
says here against him.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.930
Fine.
Let's hear it.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.301
Friday night...
Mm-hmm.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.037
...I left my house
around 6:30,

27:53.039 --> 27:54.805
And then I met
with geoff klein

27:54.807 --> 27:56.540
Around 8:00 p.M.
At his office.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.643
He doesn't have an office.
Listed under his name.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.480
But I had klein's
real e-mail address.

28:03.482 --> 28:07.117
So I wrote him,
pretended like I wanted
to invest in something.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.520
And, lo and behold,
the little fraud told me

28:09.522 --> 28:10.954
Where I could find him
right away.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.290
How did you get there,
to klein's office?

28:13.292 --> 28:16.060
Bus -- route 32.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.296
Took me forever to get
there because the first bus
wouldn't even pick me up.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.499
Passed right by me. I mean,
isn't that breaking the law?
I'm already looking
at tape from over 30 casinos,

28:22.501 --> 28:25.302
And you want me to deal
with l.A. Metro, too?

28:25.304 --> 28:27.638
Do you know how many buses
travel along that route?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.374
I don't care.
Just e-mail the security people,

28:30.376 --> 28:33.377
Get all the video for Friday
night's route 32 buses

28:33.379 --> 28:36.013
And get it over here right now
and confirm limpy's story.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.682
Yes, sir.
Meanwhile, I'm looking
around his office at all
these fancy computers

28:38.684 --> 28:41.085
And whatever else
he's got in there and...

28:41.087 --> 28:43.520
You know, I just demanded
that he sell everything

28:43.522 --> 28:45.322
And just give us back
at least some of the money.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.524
Then he tells me if
we would just leave him alone,

28:47.526 --> 28:49.026
He would make us all rich.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.361
And then he tried to push me
out the door.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.230
I had every right
to defend myself.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.866
Not on mr. Klein's
property.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.535
And you entered
under false pretenses.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.104
Even though
he pushed me?

29:00.106 --> 29:03.340
Okay, just tell us
how you fought back.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.442
[ scoffs ]
I...I don't know.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.912
I just...Slapped him sideways
in the head with my crutch,

29:08.914 --> 29:10.914
And then after he fell,
I...

29:10.916 --> 29:14.618
Punched after him
with my other crutch...

29:14.620 --> 29:16.453
A couple of times.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.288
But, you know,
then I lost my balance,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.257
And I wound up on my back
like a turtle.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.693
And then klein drags me
out into the hallway
outside of his office

29:22.695 --> 29:24.762
A-and throws my crutches
after me.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.096
And then what did you do?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.198
I made my way back
to the bus stop,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.567
Started chasing down
more route 32 drivers

29:30.569 --> 29:32.803
For an hour because,
believe it or not,

29:32.805 --> 29:35.439
Those drivers won't stop
and help handicapped people.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.574
Buzz: So,
that's limpy hitting the bus,

29:37.576 --> 29:40.210
Trying to make it stop
for him.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.580
And then another driver finally
pulls over and picks him up.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.983
And he stays on the bus
for 40 minutes

29:45.985 --> 29:48.118
Until he exits at the stop
by his house at 10:20 p.M.

29:48.120 --> 29:52.222
Too late for limpy
to have killed dietz
and dumped the body.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.225
Sharon:
Which means scammy's out, too,

29:55.227 --> 29:57.427
Since he was fighting with limpy
during the murder.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.595

Is he depressed?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.908
No. He's <i>depressing.</i>

30:10.910 --> 30:13.644
Believe me,
there is no crisis.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.280
[ door opens ]
so, let me guess.

30:16.282 --> 30:20.784
Scammy does not have $500,000
in cash lying around his place.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.821
He does not. But I think
you can go back to
calling him techie.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.756
Why?
You know that worthless app

30:25.758 --> 30:28.292
Our victim invested
all his money into?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.694
Vaporware, the magic beans.
Geoff klein
sold it yesterday

30:30.696 --> 30:32.496
To morgan-stanley
for $20 million in cash

30:32.498 --> 30:35.332
And another $20 million
in stock.

30:36.434 --> 30:41.205
So, because of mr. Klein, here,
a.K.A. Scammy, a.K.A. Techie,

30:41.207 --> 30:43.674
Dennis dietz died rich.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.543
And each member of his
little investment club
is gonna make millions.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.847
So, if scammy
didn't need the money

30:49.849 --> 30:53.984

wifey, and grumpy doc

our missing $500,000?

It's like told dennis and all
of them, really. I'm a genius.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.139
I don't know why they had
such a hard time grasping that.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.909
All I needed from them
was a little patience.

Tao: Mr. Klein's app,
friend funder.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.918
It allows everybody
to do exactly

31:27.920 --> 31:31.388
What the victim and
his friends did -- form
their own mutual fund.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.323
And you can name it
and track your successes

31:33.325 --> 31:35.926
