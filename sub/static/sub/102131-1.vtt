00:00.821 --> 00:03.654
[heavy breathing]

00:07.149 --> 00:10.232
[upbeat jazz music]

00:18.048 --> 00:19.980
- [Pawel] It is not porn,

00:19.980 --> 00:20.813
it is art.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.257
- [Shannon] It's fun, you know.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.052
Just a bit of fun.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.510
- [Brad] Making people's fantasies real,

00:33.510 --> 00:35.110
by allowing them to escape

00:35.110 --> 00:36.913
from their boring lives through art.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.270
- [Katya] As for me,

00:41.610 --> 00:43.343
it is job.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.030
- [Darren] It's exciting, you know, really,

00:50.030 --> 00:50.863
what's the word?

00:51.790 --> 00:52.623
Glamorous.

01:05.391 --> 01:07.430
- Well, it's about money, obviously.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.410
One billion pounds a year to be exact.

01:10.410 --> 01:13.610
That's how much this industry
brings into the UK economy.

01:13.610 --> 01:14.600
You won't hear the politicians

01:14.600 --> 01:16.620
bandying that figure about, will you?

01:16.620 --> 01:17.690
Yeah, sex sells.

01:17.690 --> 01:18.670
I mean,

01:18.670 --> 01:20.070
there's a lot of money to be made

01:20.070 --> 01:22.620
and Liquid Dreams is taking
a fair old chunk of it.

01:23.590 --> 01:25.440
- [Interviewer] How much is that?

01:25.440 --> 01:27.983
- Well, I could tell you, but
then I'd have to kill you.

01:29.770 --> 01:31.310
Now, we make about about a dozen films a year,

01:31.310 --> 01:33.130
all here in our local studio.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.620
You'll see all that later.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.900
I've been doing this for
18 years now and I mean,

01:37.900 --> 01:39.110
a lot has changed.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.750
Back then it was all VHS.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.380
You know, we'd sell to the distributor,

01:42.380 --> 01:43.900
they'd sell on to the man on the street

01:43.900 --> 01:45.660
or the sex shops, simple.

01:45.660 --> 01:49.178
But now, now you've got
the internet, haven't you?

01:49.178 --> 01:51.830
Anybody with a webcam can be a porn star,

01:51.830 --> 01:53.610
and the amount of content out there.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.080
It's unbelievable.

01:55.080 --> 01:55.913
Unbelievable.

01:55.913 --> 01:59.070
You've got millions of photos, movies,

01:59.070 --> 02:02.040
live streaming sites,
and a lot of it free.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.368
So how do we compete with
that, and still make money?

02:06.368 --> 02:09.490
[phone ringing]

02:09.490 --> 02:10.750
Quality.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.000
Quality. As my dad used to say,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.513
you offer 'em quality,
and they'll come running.

02:16.419 --> 02:17.270
- [Janine] Hello?

02:17.270 --> 02:18.710
- He was a gravedigger, but you know,

02:18.710 --> 02:20.453
the principle's still the same.

02:21.620 --> 02:25.230
So yeah, we make high-quality films,

02:25.230 --> 02:26.940
and the punters just love 'em.

02:26.940 --> 02:27.773
- [Janine] Barry?

02:27.773 --> 02:28.790
- Yeah, what is it Janine?

02:29.990 --> 02:30.823
- That was the bank.

02:30.823 --> 02:31.950
- This is Janine.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.278
Janine's in charge of production.

02:34.278 --> 02:36.230
I don't like to get involved
in the day-to-day stuff.

02:36.230 --> 02:38.838
You know, step back, keep an
eye on the bigger picture.

02:38.838 --> 02:40.480
- There's a problem with a check.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.320
- We don't have problems,
Janine, we have issues.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.840
- Sorry, Barry.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.950
There's an issue with a check.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.947
- Look, we'll talk about it when
I'm finished here, alright?

02:52.030 --> 02:52.960
Where was I?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.563
Oh yeah, high-quality films.

02:55.660 --> 02:59.512
[acoustic guitar music]

02:59.512 --> 03:02.790
This is the nerve center
of our internet operations.

03:02.790 --> 03:05.790
Pay-per-view on our entire back catalog.

03:05.790 --> 03:08.289
Huge part of the business.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.511
[sexual moaning on video]

03:10.511 --> 03:11.344
Huge.

03:16.727 --> 03:19.000
And this is where we store all the stock.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.247
Thousands of units going
all over the place.

03:22.247 --> 03:23.540
Our films are watched all over the world.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.973
You name it, Wales...

03:25.961 --> 03:30.961
Guys, it's alright guys. Not immigration,
not immigration, yeah?

03:36.040 --> 03:38.690
Nice bunch of guys, came to
us straight off the boat.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.236
Well, back of a lorry actually.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.880
Alright, let's see what's
flying off the shelves.

03:45.880 --> 03:46.950
Ah, yes.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.280
One of our all-time classics, this one.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.930
Swept the board at the awards
ceremonies a few years ago,

03:51.930 --> 03:54.280
so it was always gonna be a good seller.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.730
Must have shifted thousands
of units of this one.

03:58.310 --> 04:00.150
Another good one.

04:00.150 --> 04:03.083
A bit of a niche market, but steady sales.

04:04.900 --> 04:08.880
Ah, "Tranny Granny's Naughty Boys," yeah.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.080
Gotta be honest, not
as popular as we'd hoped.

04:12.024 --> 04:14.540
We were slightly ahead
of the curve on that one.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.180
But, as I say,

04:16.180 --> 04:19.190
make it quality and the customer will buy.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.273
Build it, and they will come.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.383
Literally.

04:29.170 --> 04:30.600
Because we want "The Seven Holes of Rome"

04:30.600 --> 04:32.440
to sell in the quality end of the market,

04:32.440 --> 04:34.583
we're doing things a
little bit differently.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.420
We're lucky enough to be working

04:39.420 --> 04:41.430
with a world-famous arthouse filmmaker,

04:41.430 --> 04:43.300
Pawel Jankowski.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.520
He's writing and directing the film.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.520
- So, I have made many
researches into Ancient Rome.

04:50.780 --> 04:55.000
Whole atmosphere of
film will be very Roman.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.200
- We want it to be

04:56.200 --> 04:57.860
as authentic as possible, Pawel,

04:57.860 --> 05:00.130
I mean within budget, obviously.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.713
- I have made some
little changes to story.

05:04.060 --> 05:04.893
- [Barry Voiceover] We're very excited

05:04.893 --> 05:05.810
to have Pawel on board.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.940
He's won many awards for his work.

05:13.548 --> 05:15.080
You probably already
know "The Weeping Sea",

05:15.080 --> 05:17.830
which won the Golden Boar at
the Minsk Biennale in '92.

05:19.912 --> 05:22.412
[eerie music]

05:27.624 --> 05:31.624
[speaking in French, dubbed in Belarusian]

06:03.559 --> 06:05.420
And because of a few
visa problems in America,

06:05.420 --> 06:06.970
he's based in this country now.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.553
So we're very honored that Pawel's decided

06:09.553 --> 06:12.470
to make the move into the
adult entertainment industry,

06:12.470 --> 06:13.970
with Liquid Dream Productions.

06:15.010 --> 06:16.590
It's gonna be amazing.

06:16.590 --> 06:18.620
- And for Emperor Cumonus we have?

06:18.620 --> 06:20.790
- We've got Jason Silver.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.090
He should be here any moment, actually.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.527
Pawel, he's very excited
to be meeting you.

06:25.705 --> 06:27.210
- And for Empress Clitora?

06:27.210 --> 06:28.100
- [Barry Voiceover]
Because Pawel's signed up,

06:28.100 --> 06:29.600
we're able to work with a bigger budget.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.130
So, you know, this could be the film

06:31.130 --> 06:33.580
that really makes the
crossover into the mainstream.

06:33.580 --> 06:37.500
We could be talking cinematic
distribution all over Europe,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.600
not just in the porn theaters,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.310
and that's worth millions.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.500
- Shannon said she can't
come this afternoon.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.100
She's got a waxing appointment.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.820
- Oh, well that's a shame, Pawel.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.670
But I mean, you're gonna love her.

06:48.670 --> 06:52.430
She's a great performer, er, actress,
you know, very versatile.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.310
Did you see that DVD I gave you?

06:54.310 --> 06:58.030
- Oh yes, it was very interesting.

06:58.030 --> 06:59.770
- Well, I've worked a lot with Shannon,

06:59.770 --> 07:00.800
and I've gotta say,

07:00.800 --> 07:01.780
I'm gonna throw it out there.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.260
I thought "Anal Amazons 3"

07:04.260 --> 07:06.000
was her finest work, yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.833
Yeah.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.850
- As for slave girls?

07:09.850 --> 07:10.950
- We've got some beautiful girls.

07:10.950 --> 07:13.440
We've got Katya, she's been
with us on a few projects now.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.610
Great performer.

07:14.610 --> 07:18.210
And Lien is a new artist
that we've just taken on.

07:18.210 --> 07:19.830
- She is English?

07:19.830 --> 07:21.940
- Well no, she's Chinese actually,

07:21.940 --> 07:23.580
but you know, it's the
big thing at the moment.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.610
It's like the new Eastern European.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.973
- But there were no Chinese
slave girls in Rome.

07:29.027 --> 07:30.320
- Oh I'm sure there were one or two, Pawel.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.440
- No, there were none.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.243
Romans never conquered Han empire.

07:35.470 --> 07:37.070
- Oh well I'm sure Lien will bring

07:37.070 --> 07:39.240
some of her other talents to the role.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.310
- She's cheaper than the other girls.

07:40.310 --> 07:43.180
- All right Janine, that's
a production issue.

07:43.180 --> 07:45.124
I'm sure Lien'll bring,

07:45.124 --> 07:46.320
she'll be a great addition to the team.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.503
- But there were no Chinese
slave girls in Rome.

07:50.724 --> 07:52.973
- Here he is, the big
man, how are you doing?

07:52.973 --> 07:53.806
- How are you doing?

07:53.806 --> 07:54.653
- This is Pawel Jankowski,

07:54.653 --> 07:56.510
he's gonna be directing
you next Wednesday.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.590
- Hi Jason.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.190
- Have a seat.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.750
- [Jason Voiceover] I suppose
I'm just one of those people

08:00.750 --> 08:01.750
who loves their job.

08:02.811 --> 08:05.061
I wake up in the morning
and I jump out of bed.

08:06.049 --> 08:09.049
[upbeat jazz music]

08:14.590 --> 08:16.823
Yeah, I'd say me mates are jealous.

08:17.674 --> 08:19.583
Who wouldn't be?

08:19.583 --> 08:24.047
I get paid to have sex with
beautiful women, and they don't.

08:25.174 --> 08:27.110
Not everyone can do this job.

08:27.110 --> 08:27.943
It takes skill.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.810
You have to be able to like, act,

08:30.810 --> 08:32.573
and have sex at the same time.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.840
It's not just about having a 10-inch cock.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.730
There's a lot of work involved.

08:37.730 --> 08:39.800
- [Interviewer] What kind of work is that?

08:39.800 --> 08:42.100
- You have to be able
to perform on camera,

08:42.100 --> 08:42.933
every time.

08:43.930 --> 08:45.610
You have to be able to get hard on demand,

08:45.610 --> 08:47.630
and you have to be able to cum on demand.

08:47.630 --> 08:48.783
It's as simple as that,

08:49.710 --> 08:50.960
with bright lights on you,

08:50.960 --> 08:54.123
and cameras rolling, and
like 20 people watching you.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.540
But I was in the Navy,
so I'm used to that.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.173
- [Interviewer] How long do you think

09:03.173 --> 09:04.030
you'll stay in the industry?

09:04.030 --> 09:05.670
- As long as I can.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.264
Some of us are just born with talent.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.970
- So Pawel, you said
you wanted to go through

09:10.970 --> 09:13.620
characterization ideas with Jason.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.160
Would now be a good time?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.600
- Yes.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.660
- Fine with me.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.493
- So,

09:19.840 --> 09:23.550
maybe before I tell you,
whom I think is emperor,

09:23.550 --> 09:26.333
you tell me whom you think is emperor.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.793
- So Jason, who do you
think the emperor is?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.570
- Oh, I get you.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.170
Well, he's an emperor, isn't he?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.190
- Yes.

09:39.190 --> 09:42.393
That's good, but what sort of man is he?

09:44.694 --> 09:46.144
- He's a man with a big dick?

09:47.900 --> 09:50.570
- I think what Pawel's
trying to get to Jason,

09:50.570 --> 09:52.340
is what ideas have you got

09:52.340 --> 09:55.697
for what sort of a
character the emperor is.

09:55.697 --> 09:58.987
You know, is he a good
person, is he a bad person?

09:58.987 --> 10:01.510
You know, the arty stuff.

10:01.510 --> 10:02.603
- Now I get you.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.610
Yeah, I did have some
thoughts about the character.

10:06.610 --> 10:08.435
Like what kind of person he is.

10:08.435 --> 10:09.582
- Yeah.

10:09.582 --> 10:10.415
Excellent.

10:10.415 --> 10:12.300
- I was thinking, right.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.200
I think he's the kind of person
that would like teabagging.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.745
- Yeah well, Jason, I think that's,

10:20.745 --> 10:21.578
that's a very good idea.

10:21.578 --> 10:22.810
I think we can probably
work that into the film,

10:22.810 --> 10:23.990
can't we, Pawel?

10:23.990 --> 10:27.020
- Yeah sure, that gives
much depth to character.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.690
- Yeah, well Jason, I think
that's all we need you for.

10:29.690 --> 10:30.850
See you next Wednesday.

10:30.850 --> 10:33.180
- Great, really nice to meet you.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.980
- No, pleasure was all mine.

10:34.980 --> 10:35.813
- Bye.

10:35.813 --> 10:36.646
- See you Jason.

10:39.461 --> 10:41.075
Well, I think that went well.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.010
You wanted to talk to Shannon
about her characterization?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.630
- Or maybe with my fucking pussycat,

10:45.630 --> 10:47.330
we could discuss characterization.

10:48.575 --> 10:51.658
[jazz trumpet music]

10:53.990 --> 10:56.363
- [Barry Voiceover] Yes, it's
the calm before the storm.

10:56.363 --> 10:57.923
A very stressful time.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.320
I pull the whole thing
together, you know.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.260
I hire the cast,
the crew, the director,

11:05.260 --> 11:06.720
all massive outlay.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.230
I'm signing checks
left, right, and center.

11:09.230 --> 11:10.893
And then you suddenly think,

11:11.940 --> 11:13.590
will I ever see this money again?

11:15.382 --> 11:17.350
And will the film be a success?

11:17.350 --> 11:19.173
So yeah, it's a stressful time.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.960
So I always tend to burn the
midnight oil the night before.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.760
- Can I go now, please?

11:26.760 --> 11:28.870
I've got to pick the kids up
from swimming at eight o'clock.

11:28.870 --> 11:30.270
- Oh yeah, of course Janine.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.950
I'm very big on family.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.500
Make sure you're in at
5:00 a.m. to open up, though.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.022
- [Janine] Yes, Barry.

11:35.022 --> 11:36.022
Goodnight.

11:36.022 --> 11:37.410
- Goodnight.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.310
She's a good producer, Janine.

11:39.310 --> 11:42.210
She don't talk much, but you
know, that can be useful.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.560
Been with me ever since
I lost the carpet shop.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.209
She was a secretary back then.

11:50.390 --> 11:52.780
I've got to say she has taken to producing

11:52.780 --> 11:53.780
like a duck to water.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.900
- [Interviewer] So you
haven't always worked

11:55.900 --> 11:57.510
in adult entertainment?

11:57.510 --> 12:00.290
- No, this is just one of my businesses.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.890
I mainly do import and export now,

12:01.890 --> 12:04.870
but in my time I've done it all.

12:04.870 --> 12:07.380
Double-glazing, right
through to used cars.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.707
I just sort of fell into this really.

12:08.707 --> 12:11.140
A mate of mine owned
Liquid Dreams at the time,

12:11.140 --> 12:13.100
and he was making a fortune,

12:13.100 --> 12:14.320
but rushed off his feet.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.060
Couldn't keep up with the demand.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.470
Asked if I could help him out, so I did.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.630
At the end of the day,
it's just a business,

12:20.630 --> 12:22.110
selling a product.

12:22.110 --> 12:22.943
- [Interviewer] Is your friend

12:22.943 --> 12:24.503
still involved in the company?

12:25.810 --> 12:27.090
- No, sadly no.

12:27.090 --> 12:30.248
A couple of months after I
started working with him,

12:30.248 --> 12:32.610
he had a tragic accident with a golf club.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.330
Sadly passed.

12:35.330 --> 12:36.480
But luckily he did leave

12:36.480 --> 12:38.760
his half of the business
in his will to me,

12:38.760 --> 12:40.593
so we were able to continue,

12:41.522 --> 12:42.773
which was a blessing.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.368
[flamenco guitar music]

13:17.690 --> 13:20.360
- I'm sorry no, he's
not in the office yet.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.550
I can't answer that, I'm sorry.

13:22.550 --> 13:24.900
- Janine, where are the togas?

13:24.900 --> 13:26.230
- In the store room.

13:26.230 --> 13:27.063
- Thanks.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.170
Hi.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.740
- No, I'm sure it can't have bounced.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.573
No.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.040
Well it just wouldn't happen.

13:36.981 --> 13:38.230
- The talent's arrived.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.410
- It's illegal to smoke in the office.

13:42.230 --> 13:46.640
Look, I'll get him to ring
you as soon as he comes in.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.473
- Yup. Yup.

13:48.690 --> 13:49.523
Thank you.

13:50.670 --> 13:52.410
I'll put the talent in the green room.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.333
If the phone rings, answer it.

13:57.019 --> 13:59.255
[phone ringing]

13:59.255 --> 14:00.880
Please help yourself to
tea and coffee, ladies.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.030
- Enjoy it? Yeah.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.240
Yeah, I love it.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.367
Proper nympho me.

14:09.367 --> 14:10.823
I'd have shagged my
boyfriend to death by now,

14:10.823 --> 14:12.550
if I wasn't having sex at work.

14:12.550 --> 14:13.383
- [Interviewer] Does your boyfriend

14:13.383 --> 14:14.790
have a problem with your career?

14:14.790 --> 14:16.680
- No, no, he loves it.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.730
He loves coming to set when I'm filming.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.368
He was gonna come today, actually,

14:20.368 --> 14:22.725
but there's no wheelchair ramp here.

14:22.725 --> 14:24.660
- [Interviewer] Are you
excited about filming?

14:24.660 --> 14:25.500
- Oh yeah, yeah.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.190
I've got quite a few scenes,
which is always good.

14:28.190 --> 14:30.570
Working with Jason, he's
always a lot of fun.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.190
And he keeps himself clean, not
like some of the other guys.

14:33.190 --> 14:35.570
- No, just for few months.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.780
Before that I was working as waitress
in restaurant,

14:38.780 --> 14:40.403
but money here is better.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.383
And here is also less of,

14:44.405 --> 14:46.653
how you say it, exploitation.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.680
- [Interviewer] How long do
you think you'll work in porn?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.020
- As for me, I just
want to save some money

14:54.020 --> 14:55.460
to buy apartment in Lithuania.

14:55.460 --> 14:59.520
So I think maybe few more months,

14:59.520 --> 15:02.110
and then I will go home
to see my children.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.810
For two years, I haven't seen them.

15:03.810 --> 15:04.930
- Hi all!

15:04.930 --> 15:06.650
- [Katya] I have here
a photograph of them.

15:06.650 --> 15:08.417
- Darling, how are you?

15:08.417 --> 15:10.100
You look great.

15:10.100 --> 15:10.940
- Oh, thanks babe.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.640
Yeah, I had my tits done again.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.473
You all right?

15:13.473 --> 15:16.283
- Oh don't, nightmare week at the theater.

15:17.954 --> 15:19.520
- [Brad Voiceover] I mean,
it's a cliche of course,

15:19.520 --> 15:21.580
but acting is my life.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.953
I live and breathe theater.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.210
I first started acting
seriously at about 18 months.

15:31.210 --> 15:32.760
Then I joined the National Youth Theatre.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.570
After that it was a short
hop to drama school,

15:34.570 --> 15:35.870
and I haven't looked back.

15:37.192 --> 15:38.090
When you have a gift,

15:38.090 --> 15:40.893
I feel you should share
that gift with the world.

15:42.479 --> 15:44.729
[techno music]

15:52.600 --> 15:57.233
To be or not to be.

15:58.610 --> 16:01.183
That is the question.

16:02.150 --> 16:04.037
- [Brad Voiceover] So, I got together
with some friends,

16:04.037 --> 16:06.637
and we founded the Theatre
Dramatique de Bermondsey.

16:07.876 --> 16:10.350
And arrows of outrageous fortune.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.030
- [Brad Voiceover] We focus on the great
dramatists,

16:14.030 --> 16:15.483
Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.640
But we deconstruct them.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.820
It's very radical in the French tradition,

16:20.820 --> 16:22.687
hence the name of the theater.

16:22.687 --> 16:25.793
But then these were very radical
playwrights for their time.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.860
To die.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.880
- [Brad Voiceover] And the audience reacts
very well to it.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.350
They really enjoy us challenging

16:36.350 --> 16:40.173
the theatrical tradition and
as well, challenging them.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.650
- [Interviewer] And does
working in pornography

16:47.650 --> 16:49.900
have an impact on your
career in the theater?

16:51.230 --> 16:53.030
- Well, you know, it pays the bills.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.810
I mean, yes, yes.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.010
Without it, TDDB wouldn't
be able to continue

17:02.010 --> 17:04.400
to make its contribution to theater.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.600
I mean, the state of the arts funding

17:06.600 --> 17:08.610
in this country is ridiculous.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.580
Like, they fund any piece of crap

17:11.580 --> 17:12.550
with a celebrity attached to it.

17:12.550 --> 17:17.550
When it comes to real art,
valuable art,

17:17.920 --> 17:21.410
the kind of art our theater
gives to the people of London,

17:21.410 --> 17:22.760
they won't give us a penny.

17:23.780 --> 17:24.613
It's absurd.

17:27.010 --> 17:27.843
- [Interviewer] But coming back

17:27.843 --> 17:29.900
to the question for a moment,

17:29.900 --> 17:31.850
does acting in pornographic films

17:31.850 --> 17:33.563
affect your work in theater?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.439
- Yes, yes, of course it does.

17:38.439 --> 17:42.260
Every role I take on in an adult film,

17:42.260 --> 17:47.233
it gives back to me and my
development as an actor.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.900
I also think it's that little bit extra

17:51.900 --> 17:53.600
I give in an adult film.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.790
I think directors really appreciate that.

17:55.790 --> 17:58.090
Yes, it's exactly what I thought, love.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.520
It's the engine, alright?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.645
You're gonna need a new one.

18:00.645 --> 18:02.939
It's gonna cost you about a grand.

18:02.939 --> 18:04.739
- I don't know if I can afford that.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.693
Is there any other way I can pay?

18:12.260 --> 18:14.250
- Well, why don't you go into my office

18:14.250 --> 18:15.600
and I'll see what I can do.

18:22.078 --> 18:22.911
- [Interviewer] How do you feel

18:22.911 --> 18:24.613
about working with Pawel Jankowski?

18:27.210 --> 18:28.860
- I'm excited.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.810
I'm very excited, yes.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.430
I'm a huge fan.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.897
I've seen all his films.

18:34.897 --> 18:39.047
"Sophie's Decision," "The
Weeping Sea," "Commandments."

18:40.107 --> 18:43.610
I've seen them all
like a thousand times.

18:43.610 --> 18:44.910
Just fantastic.

18:44.910 --> 18:45.743
I mean,

18:47.490 --> 18:48.910
obviously he went quiet for a while

18:48.910 --> 18:50.910
after the arrest in the US and all that.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.053
But God, this,

18:54.010 --> 18:58.393
this must be his first
film in about 20 years.

18:59.230 --> 19:03.163
And for me to be a part of
that is just, incredible.

19:04.370 --> 19:07.620
Another thing is we've both
had very similar artistic

19:07.620 --> 19:10.190
journeys to where we are today.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.800
So yeah, I think we'll work well together

19:13.800 --> 19:16.050
and you never know what
could come from that.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.232
- [Janine] I've been ringing
him every five minutes.

19:18.232 --> 19:19.065
- Yeah, well tell him he either pays up,
or we break his legs.

19:19.065 --> 19:20.113
- [Pawel] I don't need this.
I lived through communism!

19:23.619 --> 19:24.630
Pawel, good to see you.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.220
- Finally, where fucking were you?

19:26.220 --> 19:29.120
- As I'm sure Janine explained,
I had a family emergency.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.010
Why don't we step into my office,

19:30.010 --> 19:31.250
and get things kicked off?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.083
- Barry?

19:32.083 --> 19:34.230
- I have like 4,000
things to discuss with you

19:34.230 --> 19:36.900
before I can shoot one frame.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.640
- Barry, Barry, I need to talk to you.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.360
There's been some large
amounts of cash taken out,

19:40.360 --> 19:41.700
which I haven't got the paperwork for.

19:41.700 --> 19:42.990
- Two coffees, Janine.
- Jimmy's been asking

19:42.990 --> 19:45.103
questions about the
lighting and there's that-

19:51.780 --> 19:54.673
- Oh yeah, Roger, the cameraman.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.320
My mates are always saying it.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.053
Roger, the cameraman.

20:01.140 --> 20:03.413
I get it all the time on set, too.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.039
It's the money.

20:09.039 --> 20:09.872
End of.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.220
Normally I'd be doing

20:12.220 --> 20:14.183
nature documentaries for the BBC,

20:15.150 --> 20:17.280
but they don't always need you.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.860
So I like to do a bit of
work for Barry now and again.

20:20.860 --> 20:24.320
Besides, it makes a change

20:24.320 --> 20:26.713
from shooting eagle owls or whatever.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.563
A bit more exciting, this.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.413
Isn't it, Nathan?

20:32.860 --> 20:34.910
Nathan and I do quite a lot of work

20:34.910 --> 20:36.310
on the nature documentaries.

20:37.260 --> 20:39.343
It was me who got him the job with Barry.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.630
You enjoy the change as
well, don't you Nathan?

20:47.730 --> 20:50.787
You record one owl, you've
got them all, haven't you?

20:50.787 --> 20:53.673
And we hate monotony, don't we Nathan?

20:58.550 --> 20:59.890
Rolling stones, we are.

21:04.140 --> 21:07.560
- So, Sir Ian turns to this young upstart,

21:07.560 --> 21:09.730
and says, darling,

21:09.730 --> 21:13.340
what do you think the 'S' in 'RSC' stands for?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.173
Sondheim?

21:15.110 --> 21:17.860
[Brad laughing]

21:25.650 --> 21:28.733
Of course, we all just died laughing.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.137
- I ain't ever going there
again, it was just horrible.

21:35.137 --> 21:35.970
- What happened?

21:35.970 --> 21:38.800
- She ruined it, took
half my lady-garden off.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.047
- There, I never had a problem.

21:41.047 --> 21:42.197
They're always careful.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.835
Was she trainee?

21:44.835 --> 21:46.560
- Don't know, she must've been blind.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.297
I had to end up getting a
Bollywood, have it all off.

21:49.297 --> 21:51.010
Them diamantes aren't cheap.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.480
- Darling, you didn't!

21:52.480 --> 21:55.030
- But they want us to have a
Hollywood for this movie, yeah?

21:55.030 --> 21:56.370
With the landing strip.

21:56.370 --> 21:58.247
- What else can I do?

21:58.247 --> 21:59.497
I'm not going around
with nothing down there.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.700
I'd look like Barbie.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.000
- Does Barbie have vagina?

22:04.244 --> 22:06.710
- A Bollywood's not very Roman now, is it?

22:06.710 --> 22:07.543
- Isn't it?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.070
- Pawel's a real stickler
for authenticity.

22:10.070 --> 22:12.440
You can see it in his old period films.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.940
- Perhaps you can remove
some of the diamantes.

22:15.940 --> 22:18.820
I think I have in my bag some tweezers.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.660
- Hi everyone, can we
have you on set please?

22:20.660 --> 22:22.657
- We're still in Makeup.

22:22.657 --> 22:23.597
- I'm not in the first scene.

22:23.597 --> 22:24.620
- Oh no, we're not shooting anything yet.

22:24.620 --> 22:27.073
Pawel just wants a word with everyone.

22:28.170 --> 22:31.730
- Oh, so we

22:31.730 --> 22:34.163
finally get to meet the maestro?

22:35.223 --> 22:37.773
Darling, you'd better tell
him about your pussy.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.710
- Didn't they have diamantes in Rome then?

22:42.330 --> 22:43.163
- Thanks guys.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.500
- Can you get a picture of me and Pawel
together?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.700
- [Interviewer] How long
have you been working

22:47.700 --> 22:49.920
for Liquid Dream Productions?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.320
- Me?
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.143
- About six months.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.500
I phoned up the office one day,

22:59.471 --> 23:00.304
to see if they had any jobs,

23:00.304 --> 23:01.221
I said I'd work for free,

23:01.221 --> 23:03.430
and then Barry got me
to start the next day.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.750
Although Janine did actually start paying me

23:04.750 --> 23:05.700
a couple of weeks ago.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.030
- Barry wants you to wash his car

23:09.030 --> 23:10.533
while they're waiting to shoot.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.400
- No rest for the wicked.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.800
- So I started to think,

23:17.800 --> 23:20.940
how will story fit in with
decline in power of Senate?

23:20.940 --> 23:25.000
And how will Emperor Cumonus
behave because of this?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.280
- I have a question.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.113
- Yes, Brad.

23:28.005 --> 23:28.838
- Hi Pawel.

23:28.838 --> 23:31.232
- Hi, it's pronounced P-A-V-E-W.

23:31.232 --> 23:33.423
- Sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry.

23:34.610 --> 23:38.100
So Pawel, is this going to be
a more Brechtian production?

23:38.100 --> 23:41.223
Because the set is so
bare, and there's no props.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.490
- Are you for real?

23:43.490 --> 23:47.250
- Although, as the majority of
the cast don't actually have names,

23:47.250 --> 23:49.780
it's harking back to the
tradition of the morality play.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.793
So, I mean, I am Centurion.

23:53.860 --> 23:56.160
Who am I?

23:56.160 --> 23:57.963
What does this name mean for me?

24:00.030 --> 24:01.810
- There is bare set because

24:01.810 --> 24:05.100
I have been given no
fucking money to create art.

24:05.100 --> 24:07.310
And your character is called Centurion

24:07.310 --> 24:09.073
because he is a centurion.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.653
- Such a simple interpretation.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.760
I love it, I totally agree.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.633
- Iesus Christos.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.852
- Well, thank you Brad.

24:19.852 --> 24:20.870
Pawel, can we wrap things up?

24:20.870 --> 24:22.250
- Well, I have some more informations

24:22.250 --> 24:23.280
I want to give actors.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.770
- Yeah, but time is money,

24:24.770 --> 24:26.300
and I think after half an hour,

24:26.300 --> 24:27.133
everybody's got the gist

24:27.133 --> 24:29.310
of where you're coming from artistically.

24:29.310 --> 24:30.310
If we can get ready

24:30.310 --> 24:32.483
for the first scene, everyone, please?

24:34.244 --> 24:36.600
- Did you see it in his eyes, so intense.

24:40.930 --> 24:42.830
- I had a word with Pawel
about the slave girl scene,

24:42.830 --> 24:43.663
it's all sorted.

24:44.530 --> 24:45.890
- Cool.

24:45.890 --> 24:46.723
I just thought a spitroast

24:46.723 --> 24:49.080
would be a bit more, you know, classy.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.627
- Yeah yeah, I'm totally
with you. That's what it needs--

24:58.020 --> 24:58.853
- Hello?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.120
Hello?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.993
Could I speak to Lien please?

25:04.980 --> 25:06.763
I'm afraid I don't understand.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.283
Do you speak English?

25:11.500 --> 25:14.593
Do you speak English?

25:18.940 --> 25:19.900
- [Barry] Any luck?

25:19.900 --> 25:23.160
- No, all I got was someone
speaking Arabic or something.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.490
- Shit.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.175
- Have you got another number for her?

25:26.175 --> 25:27.625
- No.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.248
It's no good.
We're going to have to get someone else.

25:29.248 --> 25:30.900
- I don't know if I can, Barry.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.350
It's all a bit last notice.

25:32.350 --> 25:34.780
- Where is second slave girl?

25:34.780 --> 25:35.810
- No need to panic, Pawel.

25:35.810 --> 25:37.407
We're just trying to track Lien down now.

25:37.407 --> 25:39.280
- I want to start scene now.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.660
Jesus, first you tell me
I have Chinese slave girl,

25:41.660 --> 25:44.160
then I do not, what the hell must I do?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.310
- Everything will be fine, Pawel.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.750
- Bullshit, find her!

25:47.750 --> 25:48.633
You, runner,

25:50.025 --> 25:52.062
you need to find slave girl.

25:52.062 --> 25:52.895
- Okay.

25:52.895 --> 25:53.728
- Where does she live, Barry?

25:53.728 --> 25:54.920
- There's no point sending
Darren to find her. By the time--

25:54.920 --> 25:56.870
- Where does she live?

25:56.870 --> 25:58.440
- Look, you look after
the artsy stuff, Pawel,

25:58.440 --> 26:00.240
and leave the rest to me, alright?

26:01.700 --> 26:02.533
- Find her.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.843
I want to start the shooting in one hour.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.888
- Walker's Court, Soho.

26:10.888 --> 26:12.550
Halfway down, there's a pink neon sign

26:12.550 --> 26:14.620
saying, "Models Upstairs."

26:14.620 --> 26:16.853
Second floor, ask for Lien.

26:23.530 --> 26:24.363
- [Interviewer] Do you think

26:24.363 --> 26:26.700
you'll find it difficult to find Lien?

26:26.700 --> 26:29.602
- Yeah, to be honest, I'm
not really sure I can.

26:29.602 --> 26:30.893
I don't know London very well.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.342
Could I borrow some money for the Tube?

26:40.620 --> 26:42.297
- Hey, where is Barry?

26:43.773 --> 26:45.110
I have Lien.

26:45.110 --> 26:47.153
- Oh yeah, he's just
right through there mate.

26:55.978 --> 26:57.278
Hi.

26:57.278 --> 26:58.111
- Hi.

27:00.341 --> 27:01.508
- [Pimp] Lien!

27:05.002 --> 27:07.220
- I mean, he just doesn't
understand that I won't do panto.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.203
I just won't do it.

27:09.455 --> 27:10.288
God.

27:11.273 --> 27:12.793
I think I need a new agent.

27:14.150 --> 27:14.983
- What's panto?

27:16.270 --> 27:18.197
- [Jason] So who else have you worked for?

27:19.160 --> 27:22.210
- I have made some films
for Narcissus Productions.

27:22.210 --> 27:24.973
- Oh yeah. I did a few with
them when I started out.

27:25.882 --> 27:27.682
You might have seen me in some of them.

27:27.682 --> 27:29.890
They liked me 'cause I'm so big.

27:29.890 --> 27:31.366
- [Katya] Oh I see.

27:31.366 --> 27:33.390
- You'd have seen me in "Muffy
the Vampire Shagger"

27:33.390 --> 27:36.240
Then I did "Space Orgy 1", "Space Orgy 2"

27:36.240 --> 27:40.108
and "Space Orgy 4", but not "Space Orgy 3".

27:40.108 --> 27:42.793
And I did "Netball Sluts"
for Narcissus, too.

27:44.690 --> 27:46.833
- I have not seen those films.

27:49.570 --> 27:51.960
- Everybody, Lien is finally here.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.550
Now, it's her first time on film,

27:53.550 --> 27:55.470
so you're gonna have
to show her the ropes.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.970
- [Brad] Barry, don't
worry, we'll look after her.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.793
Come on, come with me.

28:06.170 --> 28:07.870
It's absolutely fine, take a seat.

28:08.980 --> 28:12.050
So, it's your first time on film?

28:12.050 --> 28:14.210
Are you mainly theater like me?

28:14.210 --> 28:17.210
- Now, Lien's uncle is gonna
be with us during the shoot.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.210
He's only here to keep an eye on Lien.

28:19.210 --> 28:21.540
He won't be getting involved on set.

28:21.540 --> 28:24.860
- Her uncle doesn't look very Chinese.

28:24.860 --> 28:27.380
- Maybe her auntie
married into the gypsies.

28:27.380 --> 28:29.030
- Can I have everybody's passport

28:29.030 --> 28:30.420
by the end of the day, please?

28:30.420 --> 28:31.890
I just need to photocopy them

28:31.890 --> 28:34.793
for proof of eligibility to work.

28:34.793 --> 28:35.626
Thank you.

28:37.997 --> 28:39.670
- Ah Pawel, great news.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.130
Lien's just arrived.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.380
- Finally I can shoot fucking movie.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.230
I want Cumonus, and Slave Girl 1 and 2

28:45.230 --> 28:49.030
on set now for rehearsal, fast.

28:49.030 --> 28:50.780
- Please wouldn't go amiss.

28:50.780 --> 28:52.390
- Come on, darling.

28:52.390 --> 28:54.220
He's an artist.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.817
- So Jason, when you say,

28:56.817 --> 28:59.330
"the greatest fruit
that Gaul has to offer,"

28:59.330 --> 29:02.273
you must to pull off dress of Katya.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.916
- Right.

29:04.916 --> 29:06.150
- Now, what Cumonus says in this line

29:06.150 --> 29:08.470
is that he can conquer Gaul again.

29:08.470 --> 29:12.560
When he takes slave girl,
he becomes Julius Caesar.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.393
Slave girl is metaphor for
whole country, is that clear?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.173
- Yeah, totally.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.740
And then it's straight into the blowjob?

29:23.740 --> 29:27.010
- Yes, but camera must see
metaphorical level of blowjob,

29:27.010 --> 29:29.343
otherwise scene falls apart.

29:32.780 --> 29:35.490
- And the oral's on the table, Pawel.

29:35.490 --> 29:37.453
- Yes, and it's pronounced P-A-V-E-W.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.960
- We're going to need more light.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.140
- [Darren Voiceover] Why do I do it?

29:48.737 --> 29:50.043
It's my dream.

29:51.836 --> 29:53.236
I want to be where Jason is.

29:54.370 --> 29:55.520
- [Interviewer] Some people might say

29:55.520 --> 29:57.193
it's quite an unusual dream.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.193
- Well,

30:01.570 --> 30:02.803
you know my dad was a porn star,

30:03.936 --> 30:05.230
in the eighties and nineties.

30:05.230 --> 30:06.063
Jake Long?

30:09.717 --> 30:12.747
"Bus Shelter Sluts"..."Off the Rim"...

30:16.840 --> 30:19.963
They were massive films,
and dad was the star.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.283
You could sort of say I'm
carrying on the family tradition!

30:28.652 --> 30:31.485
[soft rock music]

30:38.680 --> 30:41.960
- Alright, darlin'! I'm here
to fix your washing machine.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.929
- But my husband's not in.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.997
- That's alright.

30:45.997 --> 30:47.113
- Can my friend watch?

30:52.652 --> 30:53.569
- Oh, yeah!

30:56.920 --> 30:59.987
- He wasn't one of those
dads that, you know,

30:59.987 --> 31:01.670
kicked a football around with me

31:01.670 --> 31:05.690
or took me to the cinema or whatever.

31:05.690 --> 31:06.840
Or ever came to see me.

31:08.010 --> 31:12.137
I mean, I guess he was just
busy with work, you know,

31:12.137 --> 31:13.103
and his wife,

31:13.990 --> 31:14.940
and his other kids,

31:18.149 --> 31:20.280
but he always sent me a video
of every film he was in.

31:20.280 --> 31:24.124
So I did get to see a lot of him.

31:24.124 --> 31:24.957
I was the only kid in my foster home

31:24.957 --> 31:26.900
whose dad was on the telly.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.880
I was dead proud of that.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.440
- [Interviewer] And now you
want to follow in his footsteps?

31:31.440 --> 31:32.390
- Can you blame me?

31:34.076 --> 31:35.810
It's an amazing life.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.660
Having sex with beautiful
women, and getting paid for it.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.610
As soon as I got out of care,

31:40.610 --> 31:44.661
I came straight down to
London so I could get started.

31:44.661 --> 31:45.523
- [Interviewer] Is your father happy

31:45.523 --> 31:47.789
about your career choice?

31:47.789 --> 31:48.622
- Well,

31:50.770 --> 31:54.963
he died of a heroin overdose
when I was about 12,

31:56.900 --> 31:59.303
but I'm sure he'd be dead
proud if he did know.

32:00.512 --> 32:02.143
- [Interviewer] And how does
your mother feel about it?

32:03.400 --> 32:05.413
- Oh, she stopped writing
back a few years ago.

32:07.876 --> 32:08.709
- [Interviewer] What would you be doing

32:08.709 --> 32:10.333
if you weren't working in pornography?

32:14.420 --> 32:15.253
- Not much.

32:17.675 --> 32:18.660
See, I'm from Carlisle,

32:18.660 --> 32:20.683
and there aren't many jobs up there.

32:21.550 --> 32:25.653
If I'd stayed, I'd probably
be working in a chip shop.

32:27.830 --> 32:29.530
- [Interviewer] Are you in a relationship?

32:29.530 --> 32:31.980
- No, not at the moment.

32:31.980 --> 32:34.799
I'm so focused on my career,

32:34.799 --> 32:37.850
that I never really had
time for a girlfriend.

32:37.850 --> 32:38.700
- [Interviewer] And have you appeared

32:38.700 --> 32:41.200
in front of the camera yet?

32:41.200 --> 32:43.080
- No, not yet.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.165
Still working my way up from the bottom.

32:45.165 --> 32:45.998
But Barry's promised me he'll let me

32:45.998 --> 32:47.240
have a walk-on part soon,

32:47.240 --> 32:49.860
or even let me be a stunt cock,

32:49.860 --> 32:51.713
which would just be amazing.

32:53.920 --> 32:54.753
Oh,

32:56.500 --> 32:57.790
a stunt cock is the person

32:57.790 --> 33:00.090
you get to finish the
scene if the lead can't,

33:02.460 --> 33:04.060
because that's actually,

33:04.060 --> 33:05.560
that's what it's about.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.840
If you're a bloke, in porn,

33:08.840 --> 33:10.030
that's it.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.990
That's what you're paid for,
and if you can't do that...well,

33:12.990 --> 33:14.190
you're in the wrong job.

33:15.050 --> 33:17.243
- [Interviewer] How long do
you think it will take you?

33:19.875 --> 33:22.080
- Well, that's usually up to the director.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.730
I mean, sometimes they want
you to last over an hour.

33:23.730 --> 33:26.230
Sometimes they want it like that.

33:26.230 --> 33:28.580
- [Interviewer] I meant,
how long will it take you

33:28.580 --> 33:29.823
to become a porn star?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.343
- Oh, sorry.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.553
Depends.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.593
It's about luck really, isn't it?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.700
I mean I'm 21, I've got the stamina.

33:45.700 --> 33:46.670
I go to the gym.

33:46.670 --> 33:50.513
I work here, so I can learn
from the stars like Jason.

33:52.072 --> 33:56.023
And then, hopefully, one
day I'll get my break.

33:58.580 --> 33:59.788
- [Interviewer] Do you think you'll be-

33:59.788 --> 34:02.871
- [Pawel] I need fucking runner now!

34:09.860 --> 34:11.300
- It is too dark.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.900
I want more light on slave girl.

34:16.312 --> 34:18.790
Jesus fucking Christ, I need more light!

34:21.250 --> 34:23.043
- Bloody hell, I'm not Superman.

34:26.620 --> 34:27.453
- Thank you.

34:28.510 --> 34:30.247
First positions, everyone.

34:32.150 --> 34:34.143
- We're turning. Board in.

34:35.967 --> 34:38.373
"The Seven Holes of Rome", Scene One.

34:39.550 --> 34:42.273
- And...action!

34:45.730 --> 34:49.583
- I've never seen a slave
girl like you before.

34:54.920 --> 34:58.000
- Janine, have we got
any vegans in this time?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.270
Only there wasn't any hummus at Aldi.

35:00.270 --> 35:02.107
- [Janine] No, no vegans.

35:02.107 --> 35:03.850
And just one vegetarian.

35:03.850 --> 35:05.623
- Ooh, that makes a change.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.233
I've got some nice pork pies in.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.400
- [Interviewer] And what's
your role in the company?

35:14.400 --> 35:16.383
- Me? Oh, I'm just a general dogsbody.

35:17.437 --> 35:18.310
- [Barry] I don't want
the cops sniffing around,

35:18.310 --> 35:20.038
so just torch it, yeah?

35:20.038 --> 35:21.398
Call you later.

35:21.398 --> 35:22.231
Hello, mum.

35:22.231 --> 35:23.064
- Hello, son.

35:23.064 --> 35:23.910
How's it going out there?

35:23.910 --> 35:25.198
- Yeah, not bad, not bad.

35:25.198 --> 35:27.090
I just gotta make a few phone calls.

35:27.090 --> 35:28.170
- All right, see you in a bit.

35:28.170 --> 35:29.170
- [Interviewer] How long
have you been working

35:29.170 --> 35:30.960
for Liquid Dreams?

35:30.960 --> 35:33.270
- 18 years, come June.

35:33.270 --> 35:37.023
I used to be the fluffer
when Barry first started out.

35:37.023 --> 35:39.280
He was a bit short-staffed,
so I used to help out.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.480
Mind you, there's not much
call for it these days,

35:41.480 --> 35:42.580
what with that Viagra.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.480
So I just do the lunches.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.870
Suits me.

35:46.870 --> 35:49.663
Barry don't pay me,
but I like to help out.

35:50.850 --> 35:53.300
And I'll be a stunt
hole when they need one.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.430
Some of the girls don't
always keep themselves nice.

35:56.430 --> 35:57.370
- [Interviewer] What does that entail?

35:57.370 --> 35:59.380
Oh, usually anal.

35:59.380 --> 36:01.807
Prawn mayonnaise is alright, isn't it?

36:01.807 --> 36:03.797
- [Janine] Fine.

36:03.797 --> 36:06.547
[sexual moaning, slapping]

36:09.012 --> 36:12.595
- [Jason] Who's the caesar?

36:38.710 --> 36:39.837
- What about last year, when I was in

36:39.837 --> 36:41.250
"Black Girls are Pink on the Inside"?

36:41.250 --> 36:42.190
You definitely took a photocopy then.

36:42.190 --> 36:44.430
- Barry doesn't like to hang
on to too much paperwork.

36:44.430 --> 36:45.813
He might have thrown it away.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.340
Thanks, darling.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.147
- Don't you feel exploited?

36:53.523 --> 36:57.173
- A little, but it was not so bad.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.146
- I just don't think,
however good the money was,

36:59.146 --> 37:01.046
I don't think I could
bring myself to do that.

37:01.046 --> 37:01.879
Thank you.

37:01.879 --> 37:04.118
I mean, I'm a trained actor after all.

37:04.118 --> 37:06.110
- All you have to do is
just stand and smile.

37:06.110 --> 37:07.310
You show jewelry to camera,

37:07.310 --> 37:09.040
and then presenter describes jewelry,

37:09.040 --> 37:11.190
and then many people
phone in and buy them.

37:12.210 --> 37:15.210
- Yeah but I just know how theater actors

37:15.210 --> 37:18.040
especially feel about
doing stuff like that.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.110
- And last week they let
me keep the necklace.

37:20.110 --> 37:22.620
Zirconium was really large.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.073
- Wages of sin, darling.

37:24.925 --> 37:28.592
[local radio traffic bulletin]

37:42.575 --> 37:44.240
- Lien,

37:44.240 --> 37:47.607
I need to take your
passport for photocopying.

37:50.665 --> 37:51.498
Passport.

37:53.190 --> 37:54.023
- No passport.

37:55.215 --> 37:56.215
- Oh, right.

37:57.538 --> 37:59.752
- What you want?

37:59.752 --> 38:01.975
- I need to see Lien's passport.

38:01.975 --> 38:02.808
- Why?

38:04.299 --> 38:07.589
- I need to take a photocopy
with the work permit.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.238
- No.

38:09.238 --> 38:11.575
- But we do it for everyone.

38:11.575 --> 38:12.797
We photocopy for anyone that works for us,

38:12.797 --> 38:16.493
otherwise there's problems
with the immigration authorities.

38:17.515 --> 38:19.015
- Immigration?

38:19.015 --> 38:19.848
- Yes.

38:22.102 --> 38:24.625
- Okay, I get passport from car.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.530
- Thank you.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.137
- What color is permit?

38:29.302 --> 38:33.438
- It depends on the type. Usually green.

38:33.438 --> 38:34.800
- Green?

38:34.800 --> 38:35.633
Okay,

38:38.349 --> 38:39.199
I will come back.

38:48.270 --> 38:51.820
- Everybody, I want to rehearse
next scene in five minutes.

38:51.820 --> 38:53.383
Five minutes.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.530
- Jesus, he's a slave-driver.

38:57.530 --> 39:01.012
- Could we have Jason, Brad
and Shannon on set please?

39:01.012 --> 39:02.224
Thank you very much.

39:02.224 --> 39:06.474
- [Shannon] At least
someone's polite around here.

39:12.026 --> 39:13.212
- Jason?

39:13.212 --> 39:17.089
I was wondering if I
could maybe talk to you.

39:17.089 --> 39:17.922
- Not a good time,

39:17.922 --> 39:18.755
I gotta focus on this next scene.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.400
- No, I mean after we wrap tonight.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.189
'cause I'm, well,

39:22.189 --> 39:23.170
I want to be a performer like you,

39:23.170 --> 39:26.060
and I just want to get some
advice from you really,

39:26.060 --> 39:27.530
if that's okay.

39:27.530 --> 39:28.363
- No problem.

39:29.459 --> 39:30.480
What's your name again?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.010
- Darren. Darren Long.

39:32.010 --> 39:33.260
I worked on "Fire in the Hole" as well,

39:33.260 --> 39:35.250
but maybe you don't remember.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.920
- Well, you know what it's like.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.130
- So I'll see you later on?

39:40.130 --> 39:40.990
- No worries.

39:40.990 --> 39:41.823
- Thanks.

39:41.823 --> 39:44.995
Thanks so much.

39:44.995 --> 39:46.167
So they're gonna take a mold of it,

39:46.167 --> 39:49.320
and make a rubber one, full size.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.830
Exactly the same,

39:50.830 --> 39:53.196
even down to the veins.

39:53.196 --> 39:54.983
It'll have me signature on it,

39:54.983 --> 39:57.932
and they're gonna put a
photo of me on the box.

39:57.932 --> 39:59.570
The women'll love it.

39:59.570 --> 40:02.783
The authentic Jason Silver experience.

40:03.850 --> 40:05.900
The bloke reckons they'll sell thousands.

40:07.470 --> 40:08.710
- How much are they paying?

40:08.710 --> 40:11.150
- Katya, from you I need more.

40:11.150 --> 40:13.900
This is most dramatic part of story for

40:14.810 --> 40:15.930
Slave Girl Number 1.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.383
- We haven't got that far yet.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.390
They're bound to fly off the shelves.

40:20.390 --> 40:22.730
- Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

40:22.730 --> 40:24.050
- Deep penetration shot.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.090
Need the best angle.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.363
- You almost kill me.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.510
- Pawel, what's my motivation here?

40:29.510 --> 40:31.460
What's Centurion trying to express

40:31.460 --> 40:32.470
by getting sucked off?

40:32.470 --> 40:34.340
- Read fucking script!

40:34.340 --> 40:36.193
I need runner, I need coffee!

40:37.046 --> 40:39.313
- Why don't we take five?

40:40.460 --> 40:43.680
- That is good idea. [cursing in Polish]

40:43.680 --> 40:45.820
- Brad, I'll make sure you
get one when they come out,

40:45.820 --> 40:46.653
like a souvenir.

40:47.620 --> 40:49.623
- Thanks Jason, that'd be great.

40:55.027 --> 40:55.990
- [Barry] Yeah, and do
it properly this time,

40:55.990 --> 40:59.070
'cause they can identify the
body from the dental records.

40:59.070 --> 41:00.202
Yeah.

41:00.202 --> 41:01.660
I'll call you back later, I've got to go.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.523
- Barry, Barry?

41:04.680 --> 41:06.660
Unfortunately, he's
been on set all morning.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.480
I haven't been able to get hold of him.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.720
Yeah, yeah, I will tell
him you called. Again.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.553
Yeah.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.340
I dunno when he can call
you back, I'm afraid.

41:14.340 --> 41:15.893
He's, hello?

41:16.840 --> 41:17.673
Hello?

41:21.032 --> 41:22.482
- I have passport of Lien.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.149
- Oh, right, lovely.

41:25.018 --> 41:25.893
I'll just take a copy.

41:29.910 --> 41:32.782
Is this supposed to be a work permit?

41:32.782 --> 41:34.528
- Yes, is fine.

41:34.528 --> 41:37.232
- But I can't accept this.

41:37.232 --> 41:38.729
- What is problem?

41:38.729 --> 41:40.410
- Well it's not a real permit!

41:40.410 --> 41:41.243
- Is.

41:41.243 --> 41:42.076
- It isn't.

41:42.076 --> 41:43.177
- Yes, is.

41:44.282 --> 41:45.115
- Barry.

41:45.115 --> 41:47.844
Can you come out here
please? We've got a problem.

41:47.844 --> 41:49.108
- [Barry] We don't have problems, Janine.

41:49.108 --> 41:50.558
- Well, we've got an issue then.

41:56.356 --> 41:58.022
- Ah, Edon. Good to see you.

41:58.022 --> 41:58.855
Yeah.

41:58.855 --> 41:59.688
Is Lien enjoying the shoot?

41:59.688 --> 42:01.023
- Yes, she like very much.

42:01.890 --> 42:02.970
- Well, what can I do you for?

42:02.970 --> 42:04.933
- It's Lien's permit. It's not real.

42:06.410 --> 42:08.621
- You sure you're reading
the dates right, Janine?

42:08.621 --> 42:10.963
- It hasn't got any dates,
it's not a real permit.

42:18.670 --> 42:21.320
- Well, that's definitely
a production issue, Janine.

42:23.170 --> 42:24.020
Coffee'd be nice.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.381
- So no problem.

42:29.381 --> 42:30.850
- Well, it is a problem.

42:30.850 --> 42:32.480
We can't employ people
that haven't got a right

42:32.480 --> 42:35.060
to work in this country,
it's against the law.

42:35.060 --> 42:36.950
We could get fined up to 10,000 pounds

42:36.950 --> 42:38.143
or they close us down.

42:40.081 --> 42:41.393
- Is not problem.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.593
- Is not problem.

42:47.800 --> 42:48.633
No.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.253
I'll just make a copy.

42:52.100 --> 42:52.933
- [speaking in Albanian]

42:56.978 --> 42:59.705
[Katya moaning]

42:59.705 --> 43:02.268
- [Jason] Oh, yeah.

43:02.268 --> 43:05.031
Have a bit of that!

43:05.031 --> 43:07.505
- [Katya] Harder, harder.

43:07.505 --> 43:10.655
- Where is Centurion? Spit-roast
should start by now.

43:10.655 --> 43:12.317
Where is Centurion?

43:12.317 --> 43:13.395
We need Centurion, where is he?

43:13.395 --> 43:16.968
Well, go find him!
- Okay, okay.

43:16.968 --> 43:18.510
Brad, you're on.

43:18.510 --> 43:21.010
- I only take my cue from
the director, thank you.

43:25.740 --> 43:27.420
- Hail, Caesar!

43:27.420 --> 43:29.141
- [Jason] Oh, I've lost wood.

43:29.141 --> 43:30.385
- [Katya] I must piss.

43:30.385 --> 43:32.920
- Cut! Somebody get me aspirin!

43:32.920 --> 43:35.360
- Yeah, I'm really pleased
with today's shoot.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.750
It's going even better than I predicted.

43:37.750 --> 43:40.263
- [Interviewer] So you're
not aware of any problems?

43:41.920 --> 43:44.730
Any issues with the shoot?

43:44.730 --> 43:46.140
- Of course, there's gonna be issues.

43:46.140 --> 43:48.290
I mean there's bound to
be issues, but you know,

43:48.290 --> 43:50.460
that's the same in any business.

43:50.460 --> 43:51.380
- [Interviewer] You're not worried about

43:51.380 --> 43:52.943
the delays in shooting today?

43:54.200 --> 43:56.580
- Well, there was a delay while
we waited for Lien to arrive

43:56.580 --> 43:57.900
and we are having to re-shoot

43:57.900 --> 44:02.130
part of the spit-roast scene,
but, no, I'm not worried.

44:02.130 --> 44:04.320
- [Interviewer] Will this
add to production costs?

44:04.320 --> 44:07.623
- No, as long as we finish
shooting by 11:59 on Friday.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.950
- [Interviewer] Why not?

44:09.950 --> 44:12.090
- Well everybody's paid
for a three day shoot.

44:12.090 --> 44:14.210
So we could shoot for 72 hours straight,

44:14.210 --> 44:16.610
and it wouldn't cost me any more money.

44:16.610 --> 44:19.423
So as long as we wrap
before Saturday, no issue.

44:21.161 --> 44:22.240
- [Interviewer] Is that legal?

44:22.240 --> 44:24.384
- [Barry] Maybe not for you lot in TV!

44:24.384 --> 44:27.134
[Barry laughing]

44:27.970 --> 44:31.100
Yeah, so I'm pleased.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.163
Very pleased indeed.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.260
- I'm so drained.

44:42.260 --> 44:43.303
You know? Like,

44:44.650 --> 44:49.650
I feel like I give a part of
my soul away to each character,

44:52.540 --> 44:54.410
but that's art.

44:54.410 --> 44:56.080
- Don't you like the shagging, then?

44:56.080 --> 44:58.230
- [Darren] Hi Jason.
- Yes.

44:58.230 --> 44:59.323
- Oh yeah, Dan.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.013
- Darren.

45:02.013 --> 45:02.846
- Yeah.

45:03.980 --> 45:06.120
- Are you still free to talk to me?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.760
- So long as it's quick.
Got a busy evening,

45:08.760 --> 45:09.810
you know how it is.

45:09.810 --> 45:10.643
- Yeah.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.770
- So what do you want to know?

45:13.770 --> 45:16.739
- Well, I just wanted your advice really,

45:16.739 --> 45:19.239
about working in the industry.

45:21.001 --> 45:22.584
- What's the dream?

45:24.266 --> 45:25.154
- I want to be you.

45:25.154 --> 45:28.071
I mean, I want to be where you are,

45:29.067 --> 45:30.967
a performer, the best in the business.

45:33.201 --> 45:34.427
- You don't want much then.

45:34.427 --> 45:35.589
- I know, it's stupid.

45:35.589 --> 45:36.422
I could never be as good as you,

45:36.422 --> 45:39.523
but even to be half as
good would be amazing.

45:40.550 --> 45:41.383
- Listen, kid,

45:42.230 --> 45:44.893
it takes a lot of talent to
succeed in this industry.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.510
And some things you just can't learn.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.343
It's just what God gave you.

45:52.330 --> 45:53.770
I've got 10 inches.

45:53.770 --> 45:54.860
What have you got?

45:56.410 --> 45:59.970
- Well, I can act okay.

45:59.970 --> 46:01.720
- No, I mean, how big's your cock?

46:02.740 --> 46:03.573
- Oh,

46:06.050 --> 46:07.723
well it's about nine inches.

46:08.950 --> 46:09.783
- Thick?

46:11.880 --> 46:12.930
- Yeah, I suppose so.

46:14.570 --> 46:16.210
- You'd better show me.

46:16.210 --> 46:19.263
- Oh, I haven't got
any photos on my phone.

46:19.263 --> 46:20.096
I can, I mean I can-

46:20.096 --> 46:20.996
- Just get it out.

46:24.140 --> 46:25.693
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

46:40.326 --> 46:41.550
- And it gets longer when it's hard?

46:41.550 --> 46:43.200
- Yeah, about half as long again.

46:44.950 --> 46:46.450
- It's not very thick, though.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.983
- It's okay, right?

46:51.863 --> 46:54.213
- Okay.

46:54.213 --> 46:56.999
There's a lot of blokes
out there with okay.

46:56.999 --> 46:59.332
- It's getting shorter now.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.261
- [Interviewer] How are you feeling?

47:05.261 --> 47:07.393
- Yeah, yeah, not too bad.

47:07.393 --> 47:08.323
A bit tired.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.553
- [Interviewer] Are you
upset by what Jason said?

47:14.860 --> 47:15.693
- A bit,

47:16.820 --> 47:20.870
I suppose, but he was just being honest.

47:20.870 --> 47:22.520
You know, he's been in
this business a long time,

47:22.520 --> 47:25.080
I mean, he's one of the
big names, Jason Silver.

47:25.080 --> 47:27.963
It's like Ron Jeremy
or Ben Dover, you know.

47:28.850 --> 47:30.043
Just a legend so,

47:31.310 --> 47:33.800
yeah, he knows what he's talking about.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.723
- [Interviewer] Does this
mean your dream is over?

47:37.827 --> 47:39.280
- I don't know. I mean I'll have to

47:39.280 --> 47:42.227
think my way around this and
look at me other options.

47:42.227 --> 47:44.600
- [Interviewer] What
are your other options?

47:44.600 --> 47:45.433
- Well,

47:47.550 --> 47:49.923
there's gay porn.

47:51.550 --> 47:53.410
I have heard that quite a
few straight blokes do it,

47:53.410 --> 47:55.210
you know, gay for pay.

47:55.210 --> 47:56.043
Money's good.

47:57.050 --> 48:00.433
Maybe you don't have to have
a huge cock if you like, take.

48:02.260 --> 48:04.060
I mean, I've never done that before,

48:05.483 --> 48:06.733
but I could give it a go.

48:08.710 --> 48:09.983
I'm sure you get used to it.

48:12.696 --> 48:15.613
[club dance music]

48:17.881 --> 48:22.881
- It's the best place to wind
down after a hard day on set.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.920
Catch up with me mates,

48:25.920 --> 48:28.463
have a laugh, set the world to rights.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.000
Round here, they all know who I am,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.880
but they don't make a big thing of it.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.380
It's nice to have a break
from the fame sometimes.

48:43.810 --> 48:45.740
So have you watched the DVD?

48:45.740 --> 48:46.573
- Yeah.

48:48.026 --> 48:49.420
- I got an award for that one.

48:49.420 --> 48:51.103
Best male performer, 2008.

48:54.860 --> 48:56.365
Did you like it then?

48:56.365 --> 48:57.198
- No.

49:00.640 --> 49:01.840
My boyfriend did though.

49:02.962 --> 49:03.795
3.40 please.

49:08.840 --> 49:09.673
Cheers.

49:12.390 --> 49:14.860
- [Interviewer] Does the
fame ever get to you?

49:14.860 --> 49:16.053
- Sometimes, yeah.

49:17.170 --> 49:18.530
But this is where I can escape to,

49:18.530 --> 49:20.713
you know, a man's home is his castle.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.220
- [Woman] Tea won't be long, son.

49:23.220 --> 49:24.053
- Thanks, mom.

49:25.500 --> 49:26.670
- [Interviewer] Has your career ever had

49:26.670 --> 49:29.615
a negative effect on your relationships?

49:29.615 --> 49:30.448
- No.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.163
That's not why my wife left me.

49:35.528 --> 49:37.602
- [Interviewer] Do you have any children?

49:37.602 --> 49:38.602
- Yeah, two.

49:39.570 --> 49:42.110
Me boy's eight, and me little girl's five.

49:42.110 --> 49:42.943
They're great.

49:43.790 --> 49:46.470
Every weekend I see 'em, they
have something new to tell me.

49:46.470 --> 49:48.280
Kids are amazing.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.113
- [Interviewer] How would you feel

49:49.113 --> 49:51.393
if they decided to work in porn films?

49:53.742 --> 49:54.842
- They're a bit young.

49:56.290 --> 49:58.030
- [Interviewer] I meant
when they're adults.

49:58.030 --> 49:58.863
- Oh right.

50:00.170 --> 50:03.500
Well, if my boy decides he wants
to do porn, I'll be happy.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.603
It's a good career.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.770
And he takes after his dad
in the trouser department,

50:07.770 --> 50:09.763
so he'll have no worries about that.

50:10.700 --> 50:11.653
But me little girl?

50:14.040 --> 50:14.873
No.

50:16.610 --> 50:18.210
I mean, I know women make more money

50:18.210 --> 50:19.513
than men in the industry,

50:20.500 --> 50:23.700
but at the end of the day,
if you're a woman in porn,

50:23.700 --> 50:25.350
you're just an object, aren't you?

50:31.110 --> 50:32.780
And I've kept all my reviews as well.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.220
It's a good thing to have, you know?

50:34.220 --> 50:35.163
Memories and that.

50:36.030 --> 50:39.080
Mom takes this down the bingo
with her to show off, don't you?

50:39.080 --> 50:41.360
- Well I'm a proud mother, aren't I?

50:41.360 --> 50:43.815
- She looks at this more
than I do, don't you?

50:43.815 --> 50:46.398
- Show 'em your reviews, love.

50:50.677 --> 50:54.177
- Here we go, "Space Orgy 1", three stars.

50:56.040 --> 50:58.603
"Open All Hours", just saw that one.

50:59.450 --> 51:01.690
Eight out of ten, pretty good.

51:04.811 --> 51:06.497
Here's one of me all-time best,

51:06.497 --> 51:08.380
"Zookeepers Take it From Behind"

51:09.959 --> 51:10.973
Where am I mentioned?

51:13.084 --> 51:14.300
Oh yeah.

51:14.300 --> 51:17.703
Jason Silver, in the cast list.

51:18.670 --> 51:19.597
Not bad, eh?

51:35.360 --> 51:36.620
- Upset me?

51:36.620 --> 51:37.970
How can this upset me more?

51:38.950 --> 51:40.430
- All right Janine, make a note.

51:40.430 --> 51:42.590
We'll send Darren out to
Starbucks or something.

51:42.590 --> 51:44.020
- Finally, thank you.

51:44.020 --> 51:46.550
Who has instant coffee
on film shoot? Jesus.

51:46.550 --> 51:49.000
- Right, now we're all ready
for today's shoot, yeah?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.520
- Yes, if I can make these people to act.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.750
- Now, tomorrow. Final day,

51:53.750 --> 51:55.270
big finale: the orgy scene.

51:55.270 --> 51:56.970
Is there anything else
we're gonna need for that?

51:56.970 --> 51:59.760
- Well, I have been having some new ideas.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.793
I think we need some more actors.

52:03.080 --> 52:05.120
- Pawel, we're already
stretched over budget as it is,

52:05.120 --> 52:05.953
I'm not gonna be able to give you

52:05.953 --> 52:08.060
any more actors, I'm afraid.

52:08.060 --> 52:10.122
- But if we don't have to pay them?

52:10.122 --> 52:11.209
- I admire your thinking Pawel,

52:11.209 --> 52:12.120
but we're not gonna find anybody

52:12.120 --> 52:13.770
who is willing to do it for free.

52:16.370 --> 52:17.203
- Children.

52:19.452 --> 52:20.819
- What do you mean?

52:20.819 --> 52:22.443
- We could have children in film.

52:22.443 --> 52:25.380
You do not pay children,
you give them candy.

52:25.380 --> 52:26.373
- That's true.

52:27.220 --> 52:28.493
- It's also illegal.

52:29.650 --> 52:31.550
- So what would they be doing, exactly?

52:31.550 --> 52:35.510
Well, they will be in swimming
pool with Emperor Cumonus.

52:35.510 --> 52:36.580
- In the final orgy scene?

52:36.580 --> 52:40.260
- Yes, they will be minnows,

52:40.260 --> 52:41.710
as Emperor Tiberius had.

52:41.710 --> 52:44.550
I want to make historical
connection with Tiberius.

52:44.550 --> 52:46.780
Will Cumonus die also in same way?

52:46.780 --> 52:48.580
Will Centurion kill him?

52:48.580 --> 52:51.018
- Well these are interesting
questions, Pawel,

52:51.018 --> 52:52.550
but we've got to consider the cost.

52:52.550 --> 52:53.640
I mean swimming costumes.

52:53.640 --> 52:56.407
How many kids you talking about?

52:56.407 --> 52:58.053
- Maybe ten, not many.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.220
And they will be naked,

53:00.220 --> 53:02.733
so we do not need for
them swimming costumes.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.342
- Brilliant! Sounds like a fantastic idea.

53:06.342 --> 53:07.990
- You're not allowed to have
children in porn films.

53:07.990 --> 53:10.140
- That's more of a
production issue, Janine.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.760
Look, can you get us a
couple of coffees, love?

53:11.760 --> 53:12.830
And can you send Darren in?

53:12.830 --> 53:15.243
I want to get him cracking
on this straight away.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.010
- [Interviewer] Aren't you worried

53:24.010 --> 53:27.083
that you are stepping into dangerous
territory by filming children?

53:28.180 --> 53:29.483
- Dangerous territory?

53:30.460 --> 53:33.290
No. I mean, that kid
who did "Home Alone",

53:33.290 --> 53:35.640
he was pretty young when he did that.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.410
- [Interviewer] But "Home
Alone" wasn't a porn film.

53:38.410 --> 53:41.010
- I think we will disagree about this.

53:41.010 --> 53:43.413
Anyway, the children
will be 10, 11 years old.

53:43.413 --> 53:45.200
They will be old enough to understand

53:45.200 --> 53:46.723
exactly what is happening.

54:00.690 --> 54:01.523
- [Interviewer] What are you doing here

54:01.523 --> 54:02.550
this morning, Darren?

54:03.710 --> 54:06.510
- Well, I'm trying to get
models for the shoot tomorrow.

54:07.470 --> 54:09.713
- [Interviewer] What kind of
models are you looking for?

54:11.130 --> 54:14.310
- Pawel told me he wants
a mix of boys and girls,

54:14.310 --> 54:16.810
between the ages of 10 and 12, he said.

54:16.810 --> 54:17.643
- [Interviewer] So you're hoping

54:17.643 --> 54:20.090
to find models in the school?

54:20.090 --> 54:20.923
- Yep.

54:22.720 --> 54:23.553
Although,

54:26.290 --> 54:27.890
they'll still be in classes now,
won't they?

54:29.568 --> 54:31.500
I guess I'll have to wait till break time.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.950
- [Interviewer] Are you
concerned about the fact

54:32.950 --> 54:35.900
that the children will be
appearing in a pornographic film?

54:39.420 --> 54:40.253
- Yes.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.343
I asked Barry if it was legal.

54:44.860 --> 54:45.923
- [Interviewer] And what did he say?

54:46.980 --> 54:49.123
- He didn't really say anything,

54:50.200 --> 54:53.440
but Pawel told me that if I
didn't do this, he'd sack me,

54:53.440 --> 54:55.740
and I'd never work in
the industry ever again.

54:56.890 --> 54:58.370
- [Interviewer] Do you think
that you're going to be able

54:58.370 --> 55:00.520
to find children willing
to be in the film?

55:02.030 --> 55:03.193
- I'm not really sure.

55:04.890 --> 55:07.233
Barry gave me these flyers to hand out.

55:08.620 --> 55:09.570
Maybe it will work.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.513
- [Interviewer] Have you had to do

55:13.513 --> 55:14.793
anything like this before?

55:17.420 --> 55:19.563
- No, not really.

55:21.535 --> 55:22.900
I mean,

55:22.900 --> 55:27.213
I suppose it's all good
experience for, you know,

55:28.600 --> 55:30.367
working in the industry.

55:32.600 --> 55:34.740
Hi, do you want to be in a film?

55:34.740 --> 55:36.260
- Sod off, pedo.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.546
- Can I help you?

55:37.546 --> 55:39.540
You're late for assembly, Becky.

55:39.540 --> 55:40.683
- Hi, yes.

55:42.470 --> 55:43.840
We're from a film production company

55:43.840 --> 55:46.250
and we are looking for
models, I mean, actors,

55:46.250 --> 55:47.810
to be in our film.

55:47.810 --> 55:50.513
- This is a school, why
are you looking here?

55:51.660 --> 55:54.010
- We need models between
the ages of 10 and 12.

55:54.870 --> 55:55.980
- Then you should apply formally

55:55.980 --> 55:58.910
through the head teacher's
office in writing.

55:58.910 --> 56:00.360
- Well I was just told
to hand out these flyers

56:00.360 --> 56:01.710
to the kids in the playground.

56:01.710 --> 56:03.277
- May I see one of those?

56:04.290 --> 56:05.123
- Yeah.

56:07.970 --> 56:09.470
We just want to film the kids.

56:11.150 --> 56:12.400
- I'm calling the police.

56:13.290 --> 56:15.186
- Look, it's not how it looks, okay?

56:15.186 --> 56:16.873
The kids won't be having sex.

56:17.810 --> 56:19.103
- Yes, police please.

56:20.580 --> 56:22.533
- I think it's time to go back
to the studio now.

56:24.370 --> 56:25.460
- Come back here!

56:27.110 --> 56:28.410
You're not going anywhere.

56:33.370 --> 56:35.260
- I'm afraid it's no use threatening me.

56:35.260 --> 56:37.096
I'm just the producer.
- Janine.

56:37.096 --> 56:38.530
- Darren, how'd it go?

56:38.530 --> 56:40.433
- Oh, good.

56:41.300 --> 56:43.190
Empty-handed, you got rid
of all the flyers, then?

56:43.190 --> 56:44.690
- Yeah. Yeah.

56:44.690 --> 56:45.663
- Well done, son!

56:48.546 --> 56:49.802
[Pawel shouting]

56:49.802 --> 56:51.080
We should have a good
crowd for tomorrow then.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.933
You'd better go and see what Pawel wants.

56:55.569 --> 56:58.369
He's a nice kid, but he's not
cut out for this business.

57:03.490 --> 57:05.005
- [Katya] Good morning.

57:05.005 --> 57:06.160
- Morning.

57:06.160 --> 57:08.219
- You want cup of tea?

57:08.219 --> 57:10.136
- No, I'm all right. Thanks, love.

57:11.910 --> 57:13.550
- What is wrong with this city?

57:13.550 --> 57:15.280
Delays on the Tube again.

57:15.280 --> 57:18.119
It would have been quicker to walk. Jesus.

57:18.119 --> 57:18.970
- You want cup of tea?

57:18.970 --> 57:20.810
- Is there coffee?

57:20.810 --> 57:21.793
- There is instant.

57:23.490 --> 57:25.490
- I would rather die.

57:25.490 --> 57:26.393
Tea it is.

57:28.227 --> 57:30.243
I'm in such a mood from the Tube!

57:32.320 --> 57:34.860
We have an anal scene tonight, don't we?

57:34.860 --> 57:36.060
- Yeah.

57:36.060 --> 57:37.193
- Right, okay.

57:41.100 --> 57:43.740
Is that single or double penetration?

57:43.740 --> 57:46.300
- Single. Jason ain't in that scene.

57:46.300 --> 57:48.600
- Thank goodness! I can't stand double.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.110
I always feel like it's really
hard to give it your all

57:51.110 --> 57:53.250
when someone else's legs are
in your performance space.

57:53.250 --> 57:55.920
Plus, very few directors can actually

57:55.920 --> 57:57.840
block a DP scene convincingly,

57:57.840 --> 58:00.390
although I think Pawel
will do an incredible job.

58:00.390 --> 58:01.570
- [Darren] Hey, guys.

58:01.570 --> 58:02.460
- Hi, sweetheart.

58:02.460 --> 58:03.327
- Are we going in now?
I've only just arrived.

58:03.327 --> 58:05.000
- No, no, you're cool.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.407
It's just the rehearsal for
the girl-on-girl scene.

58:06.407 --> 58:08.853
Can we have Katya and
Shannon on set, please?

58:11.830 --> 58:13.167
- Thank you, darling.

58:14.070 --> 58:16.205
- [Shannon] How heavy do you
want me to go on your nipples?

58:16.205 --> 58:19.360
[Katya muffled]

58:19.360 --> 58:22.127
- What would I be doing
if I didn't work in porn?

58:28.970 --> 58:30.670
- Probably something with the RSC.

58:32.680 --> 58:33.853
Maybe TV.

58:36.430 --> 58:37.713
"Silent Witness"?

58:38.870 --> 58:39.743
"Silent Witness".

58:46.190 --> 58:48.060
- I would work in office.

58:48.060 --> 58:49.450
Maybe.

58:49.450 --> 58:51.850
Back in Lithuania I would
work in power station.

58:59.078 --> 59:00.328
- I don't know.

59:01.410 --> 59:02.660
I don't want another job.

59:04.140 --> 59:08.530
[speaking in Mandarin Chinese]

59:08.530 --> 59:11.550
- She say good make massage.

59:13.340 --> 59:14.173
Very cheap.

59:24.428 --> 59:25.761
- I don't know.

59:26.700 --> 59:27.800
- [Interviewer] How do your family feel

59:27.800 --> 59:29.480
about your career choice?

59:29.480 --> 59:32.960
- Well, Barry's stepdad,
he wants me to retire.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.820
He says at my age I should
be taking things easy.

59:35.820 --> 59:38.110
But I enjoy it, so why not?

59:38.110 --> 59:39.550
- [Interviewer] What do you
think you would be doing

59:39.550 --> 59:42.300
if you didn't work in the
adult entertainment industry?

59:43.613 --> 59:44.863
- I don't know.

59:45.940 --> 59:47.663
I'd probably be working on a checkout,

59:48.720 --> 59:51.150
but that's no kind of life, is it?

59:51.150 --> 59:53.070
I'd be ashamed to tell the grandkids

59:53.070 --> 59:54.913
that I worked in a supermarket.

59:56.220 --> 59:58.193
Hello love, are you alright?

59:58.193 --> 59:59.743
- Yeah.

59:59.743 --> 1:00:01.066
Are you okay to stunt hole?

1:00:01.066 --> 1:00:02.730
- Of course I am, who is it?

1:00:02.730 --> 1:00:03.563
- It's Katya.

1:00:03.563 --> 1:00:04.430
It's for the closeup.

1:00:04.430 --> 1:00:07.160
- Oh, no problem, I'll be in in a minute.

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:09.560
Janine, I'm just going on set.

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:11.873
I'll warm them sausage
rolls up in a minute.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:17.360
[nature documentary on TV in background]

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:19.470
- Daddy loves you, too.

1:00:19.470 --> 1:00:21.967
Can't wait to see you at the weekend.

1:00:24.493 --> 1:00:26.420
I miss you too, sweetheart.

1:00:26.420 --> 1:00:27.720
Can you put Mommy back on?

1:00:31.620 --> 1:00:33.270
So I'll pick them up on Saturday.

1:00:34.950 --> 1:00:35.783
About nine.

1:00:40.030 --> 1:00:42.130
I've already given you this month's money.

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.013
Well what's it gone on?

1:00:48.043 --> 1:00:50.043
And were all those clothes for the kids?

1:00:51.327 --> 1:00:54.566
[quiz show on TV in background]

1:00:54.566 --> 1:00:56.899
We'll talk about this later.

1:00:59.850 --> 1:01:04.063
- Can we have Jason, Shannon,
Brad and Katya on set please?

1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:08.650
- Can you put for me in
fridge one Scottish egg?

1:01:08.650 --> 1:01:09.765
- No problem, love. Of course I will.

1:01:09.765 --> 1:01:10.765
- Thank you.

1:01:12.341 --> 1:01:13.183
- Here we go again.

1:01:14.370 --> 1:01:17.600
- Finally, slave girl lying on table,

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:18.983
and fade out.

1:01:22.202 --> 1:01:23.940
- And then the money shot's
the last part of the scene?

1:01:23.940 --> 1:01:26.760
- No, last thing is slave
girl lying on table.

1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:29.950
She is ravaged like homeland.

1:01:29.950 --> 1:01:31.363
Beauty is destroyed.

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:34.930
- So when's the money shot?

1:01:34.930 --> 1:01:36.570
- I actually haven't had mine yet, either.

1:01:36.570 --> 1:01:38.113
- There is no money shot.

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:42.010
- What?

1:01:42.010 --> 1:01:43.843
- There is no money shot.

1:01:44.876 --> 1:01:47.163
- Great rehearsal guys, I think.

1:01:48.688 --> 1:01:50.390
Pawel, what's all this
about no money shot?

1:01:50.390 --> 1:01:52.230
Are you trying to give me
another heart attack?

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:55.153
- There will be no
ejaculating in this scene.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:57.583
- What a joker!

1:01:58.490 --> 1:02:01.160
Look, I'll tell you what everybody,
why don't you all take five,

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:03.273
and I'll discuss things with Pawel?

1:02:12.793 --> 1:02:14.360
Pawel old son, you had
me going for a minute.

1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:15.533
No money shot.

1:02:15.533 --> 1:02:17.730
- I am not having you going.

1:02:17.730 --> 1:02:18.803
- But this is porn, Pawel.

1:02:18.803 --> 1:02:20.010
There's always a money shot.

1:02:20.010 --> 1:02:22.990
- It is not porn, it is art.

1:02:22.990 --> 1:02:25.700
Anyway there are many
money shots in the film,

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:27.010
but not in this scene.

1:02:27.010 --> 1:02:29.800
It does not work with complex
narrative I have written.

1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:31.410
- Well, I'm sure it does Pawel.

1:02:31.410 --> 1:02:32.700
We've got to think of the audience here.

1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:36.330
- I am director, and I
do not want ejaculating.

1:02:36.330 --> 1:02:39.053
- And I've got a lot of
money invested in this film.

1:02:40.430 --> 1:02:41.620
- You don't like it?

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:43.803
- No Pawel, no I don't.

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:45.640
- Then you will find new fucking director.

1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:49.453
I will leave and I will
take EU funding with me.

1:02:57.150 --> 1:02:57.983
- Any news?

1:02:59.050 --> 1:03:01.660
- No, they're still in Barry's office.

1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:03.460
- Thank God we get paid by the day.

1:03:03.460 --> 1:03:06.180
- Kid, you're gonna need
to sort out the gents.

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:07.250
- Why?

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:09.753
- The toilet's blocked, it's
leaking all over the floor.

1:03:15.610 --> 1:03:17.943
- Can I have everybody
back on set, please?

1:03:19.124 --> 1:03:20.480
- Are we having a money shot or not?

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:22.730
- For artistic reasons
Pawel and I have agreed

1:03:22.730 --> 1:03:25.793
there is to be no money shot
in this particular scene.

1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:29.940
- This is the weirdest
film I've ever worked on.

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:31.160
- However, I would like everybody

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:33.170
to stay a little later tonight.

1:03:33.170 --> 1:03:35.210
- Why do I have to stay behind?

1:03:35.210 --> 1:03:36.647
- Will you pay extra?

1:03:36.647 --> 1:03:38.140
- Well, I just want to get a cum shot,

1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:39.483
you know, for emergencies.

1:03:40.490 --> 1:03:41.410
- Of course.

1:03:41.410 --> 1:03:42.770
- Best wait until Pawel's left, though.

1:03:42.770 --> 1:03:43.970
Keep it on the down low.

1:03:45.830 --> 1:03:47.090
- Darling, what do you
want me to call you,

1:03:47.090 --> 1:03:49.580
bitch or slut? I forget your preference.

1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:51.960
- As for me, I think slut is better.

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:52.990
- Slut?
- Slut.

1:03:52.990 --> 1:03:53.873
- Slut, okay.

1:03:55.287 --> 1:03:57.870
[upbeat music]

1:04:02.647 --> 1:04:05.950
- [Interviewer] Katya, how
do you feel today went?

1:04:05.950 --> 1:04:07.653
- It was normal.

1:04:10.010 --> 1:04:12.010
- Oh no, I just wrapped.

1:04:12.010 --> 1:04:13.780
I had another scene to do, so-

1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:16.323
It was nothing, just
some BBC costume drama.

1:04:18.150 --> 1:04:19.450
Yeah, a complete yawn!

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:23.920
- [Interviewer] How do you
think filming went today, Jason?

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:25.933
- Yeah, I thought I was pretty good.

1:04:25.933 --> 1:04:27.570
I've just seen some of the playback.

1:04:27.570 --> 1:04:30.380
I think it could be the best
performance of me career.

1:04:30.380 --> 1:04:32.377
Barry's already talking about awards.

1:04:33.370 --> 1:04:35.460
- [Interviewer] What
are you going to do now?

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:38.750
- Going down the pub
to celebrate, usual crowd.

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:41.120
There'll be some mischief
tonight, I'll tell ya.

1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:42.960
- [Interviewer] Are you
filming tomorrow as well?

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:45.800
- Yeah, I know some blokes in the business

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:47.567
can't go out on the sauce
the night before a shoot.

1:04:47.567 --> 1:04:50.470
But I've never had any problem performing.

1:04:50.470 --> 1:04:53.847
I'll be there tomorrow,
bright and early, and hard.

1:04:55.108 --> 1:04:55.941
Night!

1:05:04.810 --> 1:05:07.610
- I thought that'd fit
really well with the film.

1:05:07.610 --> 1:05:08.770
Pawel might want to do a closeup

1:05:08.770 --> 1:05:11.340
if I'm doing a handjob or something.

1:05:12.235 --> 1:05:14.350
- Darling, do you take sugar
in your tea? I don't remember.

1:05:14.350 --> 1:05:15.260
- Yes please, one.

1:05:16.650 --> 1:05:18.730
As for me, I think they are pretty.

1:05:18.730 --> 1:05:20.747
I like palm trees.

1:05:20.747 --> 1:05:22.847
- Can I have everybody's attention please?

1:05:24.057 --> 1:05:26.493
I've got some tragic news.

1:05:29.043 --> 1:05:30.643
There's no easy way to put this.

1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:32.763
Jason's dead.

1:05:33.804 --> 1:05:35.067
- What?

1:05:35.067 --> 1:05:35.900
- Oh my God!

1:05:35.900 --> 1:05:38.763
- Yeah, he bled to death
last night at the pub.

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:42.843
- Was he stabbed?

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.093
Who would stab Jason?

1:05:45.093 --> 1:05:46.410
- No, no, nothing like that.

1:05:46.410 --> 1:05:48.930
He caught his cock...his penis...

1:05:48.930 --> 1:05:50.420
in his fly when he was having a wee

1:05:50.420 --> 1:05:52.270
and he severed an artery.

1:05:52.270 --> 1:05:53.700
They found him on the floor of the gents,

1:05:53.700 --> 1:05:55.700
got him into the back of the ambulance.

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:58.310
But it was too late, he'd lost too much blood.

1:05:58.310 --> 1:06:01.230
The doctors said it was
the size that killed him.

1:06:01.230 --> 1:06:04.230
If he'd had a smaller penis, who
knows? He might have survived.

1:06:06.143 --> 1:06:07.367
[Shannon crying]

1:06:07.367 --> 1:06:09.678
- Jason Silver, dead.

1:06:09.678 --> 1:06:11.345
I don't believe it.

1:06:12.468 --> 1:06:14.230
- You know his real name was Alan?

1:06:14.230 --> 1:06:17.555
- So, is film over?

1:06:17.555 --> 1:06:18.388
- I don't know, Katya.

1:06:18.388 --> 1:06:21.140
I mean, at this point, I'm
trying to hold things together

1:06:21.140 --> 1:06:23.430
'cause I know it's what
Jason would have wanted.

1:06:23.430 --> 1:06:24.540
- Definitely.

1:06:24.540 --> 1:06:25.661
- Absolutely.

1:06:25.661 --> 1:06:27.241
I mean the show must go on.

1:06:27.241 --> 1:06:28.830
- Now look, we're not going to
be able to do much shooting,

1:06:28.830 --> 1:06:30.850
so you might as well
all take an early lunch.

1:06:30.850 --> 1:06:32.723
But be back by one, yeah?

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:41.700
- It's unbelievable.

1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:42.933
He was here yesterday.

1:06:43.990 --> 1:06:44.823
Now he's gone.

1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:47.763
- I gave him blowjob. Now he's dead.

1:07:00.910 --> 1:07:02.933
- [Shannon] Hello, puppy!

1:07:06.430 --> 1:07:07.630
- [Interviewer] Are you
worried about the future

1:07:07.630 --> 1:07:09.760
of the film now that Jason is dead?

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.270
- No, I'm sad that he's gone.

1:07:12.270 --> 1:07:13.730
I miss working with him,

1:07:13.730 --> 1:07:15.178
but I'm sure we'll carry on.

1:07:15.178 --> 1:07:17.490
Barry'll sort something out.

1:07:17.490 --> 1:07:18.778
- [Interviewer] How are
you gonna pass the time

1:07:18.778 --> 1:07:20.690
before you're due back on set?

1:07:20.690 --> 1:07:22.320
- I've come to meet Tony at work,

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:24.400
see if we can sneak in
a quickie on his break.

1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:26.676
I'm so horny! [laughing]

1:07:26.676 --> 1:07:27.509
- [Man] Alright, Shannon?

1:07:27.509 --> 1:07:29.115
- Hi Dean, you alright?

1:07:29.115 --> 1:07:30.060
- Are you seeing Tony?

1:07:30.060 --> 1:07:30.893
- Yeah.

1:07:30.893 --> 1:07:31.860
- I'll let him know you're here.

1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:32.693
- Thanks, love.

1:07:38.110 --> 1:07:40.690
Tony doesn't actually work
in the slaughterhouse.

1:07:40.690 --> 1:07:42.820
He's in Accounts Payable.

1:07:42.820 --> 1:07:44.350
- [Interviewer] How long
have you been together?

1:07:44.350 --> 1:07:45.780
- Almost two years.

1:07:45.780 --> 1:07:47.660
- [Interviewer] How did you meet?

1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:50.640
- He sent me fan mail, can you believe it?

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:52.900
At first I thought he
was one of them saddos.

1:07:52.900 --> 1:07:55.130
You know, loves my work.

1:07:55.130 --> 1:07:57.020
But he wrote me a really sweet letter,

1:07:57.020 --> 1:07:58.240
and he sent me a poem.

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:01.793
So I wrote back, and the
rest is, as they say...

1:08:03.340 --> 1:08:05.330
- [Interviewer] Where do you
see the relationship going?

1:08:05.330 --> 1:08:07.300
- Well...marriage, I hope.

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:10.470
I just can't imagine
being with anyone else.

1:08:10.470 --> 1:08:11.650
He's so clever.

1:08:11.650 --> 1:08:15.300
And supportive, and he loves my work,

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:16.880
but he's looking to the future.

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:20.140
He wants me to go back
and finish my education,

1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:22.210
which is something I thought I'd never do.

1:08:22.210 --> 1:08:23.713
Porn just got in the way.

1:08:24.550 --> 1:08:27.100
But yeah, he wants me
to go back to college.

1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:29.000
- [Interviewer] And is that what you want?

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.880
- One day, yeah.

1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:33.330
I love my job, but I can't
keep doing it forever.

1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:35.540
People aren't gonna pay to see it

1:08:35.540 --> 1:08:37.390
when it's down by my knees, are they?

1:08:38.930 --> 1:08:40.880
- Well, we're all very upset obviously.

1:08:42.261 --> 1:08:44.200
Jason was like one of the family,

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.550
and we are a family here.

1:08:46.550 --> 1:08:48.613
You know, a family who
has sex with each other.

1:08:48.613 --> 1:08:51.240
- [Interviewer] Can you
continue making the film now?

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:52.440
- To be honest, I don't know.

1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.990
I'm waiting now to
speak to Pawel about it,

1:08:54.990 --> 1:08:55.900
but you know, I think, you know,

1:08:55.900 --> 1:08:57.470
as I said to the cast and crew just now,

1:08:57.470 --> 1:08:59.911
I think that's what
Jason would have wanted.

1:08:59.911 --> 1:09:00.877
He would have wanted us to continue.

1:09:00.877 --> 1:09:03.600
I mean he was devoted to this industry.

1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:04.840
- Pawel will be here in a minute.

1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:05.673
- All right, Janine.

1:09:05.673 --> 1:09:06.820
Send him in when he gets here.

1:09:06.820 --> 1:09:07.820
- Yeah.

1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:10.560
- Oh Janine, can you
give Jason's mum a call?

1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:11.393
- Yeah.

1:09:11.393 --> 1:09:13.377
- I spoke to her just now,
she seemed a little upset.

1:09:13.377 --> 1:09:15.590
And I did explain that
it is in his contract.

1:09:15.590 --> 1:09:17.870
He only gets paid at the end of filming.

1:09:17.870 --> 1:09:19.740
So you're gonna have to smooth that over.

1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:21.080
Worst comes to worst,

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:23.811
send her some M&S
vouchers or something.

1:09:23.811 --> 1:09:24.644
- Yeah, of course.

1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:27.820
- Well, unfortunately,
a contract's a contract.

1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:30.510
I mean, even at this sad, sad time.

1:09:30.510 --> 1:09:32.520
Pawel, there you are, take a seat.

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:34.920
I broke the tragic news
to Pawel this morning,

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.530
and he was of course devastated.

1:09:36.530 --> 1:09:38.480
- How am I going to
finish my fucking movie?

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.184
- There's a lot of support from
the cast to continue, Pawel.

1:09:41.184 --> 1:09:42.017
- Barry?

1:09:42.017 --> 1:09:42.850
- Yeah.

1:09:42.850 --> 1:09:43.683
- The crew are wondering

1:09:43.683 --> 1:09:44.900
if we're going to be
shooting anything today

1:09:44.900 --> 1:09:46.060
or can they go home?

1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:48.307
- If they want to get paid, they'll stay.

1:09:48.307 --> 1:09:50.770
- But how can we continue
without Emperor Cumonus?

1:09:50.770 --> 1:09:52.190
There's no lead actor.

1:09:52.190 --> 1:09:54.400
- Well why don't we shoot
some more scenes with Brad?

1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:56.610
- No no no, whole story is about emperor.

1:09:56.610 --> 1:09:59.930
We cannot make story about
Centurion, whole film will die.

1:09:59.930 --> 1:10:01.238
- [Darren] Pawel?

1:10:01.238 --> 1:10:02.280
- When will you say it correct,

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:03.380
it's pronounced P-A-V-E-W!

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.550
We will shoot with new Cumonus.

1:10:06.550 --> 1:10:08.019
- You're giving me an ulcer here.

1:10:08.019 --> 1:10:09.677
- We will re-shoot, there isn't other way.

1:10:09.677 --> 1:10:12.100
- But the money just isn't
there for a re-shoot.

1:10:12.100 --> 1:10:12.933
- But I can-

1:10:12.933 --> 1:10:13.966
- Why the fuck still are you here?

1:10:13.966 --> 1:10:14.870
This is a private meeting.

1:10:14.870 --> 1:10:16.840
- What we need to do, is
just get another actor.

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:18.130
We can sort the rest out in the edit.

1:10:18.130 --> 1:10:19.753
- Yeah.

1:10:19.753 --> 1:10:20.836
- I'll do it.

1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:23.760
I'll play the emperor.

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:26.313
- You are too young, and you're not actor.

1:10:27.250 --> 1:10:28.860
- He makes a fair point, Darren.

1:10:28.860 --> 1:10:31.670
I mean, if we were to employ
an inexperienced actor,

1:10:31.670 --> 1:10:33.760
the film would suffer, artistically.

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:34.810
- I'll work for free.

1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:38.060
- Now let's not be too hasty here, Pawel.

1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:40.340
I mean, I've had my eye on
young Darren here for a while

1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:41.870
as someone with potential.

1:10:41.870 --> 1:10:43.660
- I prefer to walk away from my film,

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:46.230
than have peasant in it.

1:10:46.230 --> 1:10:49.210
- Well Pawel, that is
of course your decision,

1:10:49.210 --> 1:10:50.590
but it would be a shame to walk away

1:10:50.590 --> 1:10:53.417
from your director's fee
as well, wouldn't it?

1:10:57.140 --> 1:10:59.130
- I want him to make screen
test, with one slave girl, now.

1:10:59.130 --> 1:11:01.940
If it isn't good, he
will not be in my film.

1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:03.333
- Fair enough. Darren?

1:11:04.650 --> 1:11:06.200
Great, let's get cracking then.

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:09.740
- A bit nervous, yeah.

1:11:10.690 --> 1:11:13.860
- [Interviewer] What does
this opportunity mean to you?

1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:16.463
- Oh, it means everything.

1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:19.038
I've waited all my life for this,

1:11:19.038 --> 1:11:21.690
and I finally get the
chance to prove myself.

1:11:21.690 --> 1:11:23.610
- Just treat it the same
as any of the other scenes

1:11:23.610 --> 1:11:25.430
you've done with Jason.

1:11:25.430 --> 1:11:27.800
- [Darren] I know my dad
would be really proud.

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:28.850
- [Interviewer] Did
you know you'd be doing

1:11:28.850 --> 1:11:30.920
your screen test with Lien?

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.583
- No, I'm really pleased.

1:11:35.260 --> 1:11:37.650
But I like all the girls, obviously.

1:11:37.650 --> 1:11:39.890
- Finally, I have actors.

1:11:39.890 --> 1:11:41.290
Now we must do this quickly.

1:11:42.390 --> 1:11:44.463
- [Barry] Just lay down
on the table, love.

1:11:45.607 --> 1:11:47.367
Lien's ready when you are, Pawel.

1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:51.813
- Camera turning.

1:11:51.813 --> 1:11:53.313
- [Roger] Turning.

1:11:54.570 --> 1:11:55.760
- Runner.

1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:57.270
- Yes?

1:11:57.270 --> 1:11:58.720
- I want you to fuck her now.

1:12:01.810 --> 1:12:05.053
- Do you want any, er, foreplay?

1:12:05.930 --> 1:12:08.126
- No, just fuck her.

1:12:08.126 --> 1:12:09.013
- Okay.

1:12:09.013 --> 1:12:10.013
- Right now.

1:12:25.966 --> 1:12:28.753
Hurry up, fuck her already.

1:12:28.753 --> 1:12:31.836
[uplifting organ music]

1:12:58.890 --> 1:13:02.300
- Yeah, yeah I mean I'm very
pleased, very pleased indeed.

1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:04.060
I mean it was a great screen test,

1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:05.783
and Pawel's very pleased too.

1:13:07.380 --> 1:13:09.516
- [Interviewer] So you
can finish the film?

1:13:09.516 --> 1:13:11.128
- Absolutely.

1:13:11.128 --> 1:13:11.961
- [Interviewer] Is that going to mean

1:13:11.961 --> 1:13:14.850
a lot of extra work for the cast and crew?

1:13:14.850 --> 1:13:17.170
- No, you see, that's why
we pay 'em by the day,

1:13:17.170 --> 1:13:18.003
and not the hour.

1:13:18.003 --> 1:13:22.170
So we're gonna be filming till,
I don't know, 11:59 tonight,

1:13:22.170 --> 1:13:24.460
but we'll get it all done.

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:26.570
- [Interviewer] Aren't there
going to be continuity problems

1:13:26.570 --> 1:13:28.560
with two people playing one character?

1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:31.130
- No, I've got one of the
best editors in the business.

1:13:31.130 --> 1:13:33.053
You will not be able to see the join.

1:13:34.527 --> 1:13:37.277
[sexual bumping]

1:13:40.150 --> 1:13:42.600
- I mean my accountant says I
can offset it against my tax,

1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:45.530
so I don't actually lose much.

1:13:45.530 --> 1:13:46.610
- I'll have to look into that.

1:13:46.610 --> 1:13:49.338
I could save myself a lot of money.

1:13:49.338 --> 1:13:51.615
- [Pawel] And...cue emperor!

1:13:51.615 --> 1:13:55.533
- Centurion, how dare you defile my wife?

1:13:59.060 --> 1:13:59.893
- How was that for you darling?

1:13:59.893 --> 1:14:00.726
- Yeah, good.

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:02.920
You did well, darling.

1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:04.250
- Really? Thanks.

1:14:04.250 --> 1:14:06.800
- Well done son, I knew you had it in you.

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:07.993
- It was just the rehearsal.

1:14:09.070 --> 1:14:10.440
- The real thing'll be
fine, don't worry about it.

1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:11.940
- Where the fuck are my children?

1:14:11.940 --> 1:14:14.290
I want to shoot orgy scene right after.

1:14:14.290 --> 1:14:17.020
- Relax Pawel, they're not due till two.

1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:20.043
- If they will not come, I
will be killing some runners.

1:14:26.552 --> 1:14:28.200
- [Interviewer] How is
filming going this afternoon?

1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:30.536
- Really, really well, yeah.

1:14:30.536 --> 1:14:31.710
We're just about to shoot my first scene.

1:14:31.710 --> 1:14:33.263
- [Interviewer] Are you nervous?

1:14:34.378 --> 1:14:35.978
- You know what, no, not really.

1:14:37.030 --> 1:14:39.970
I mean, I've been training
for this for years.

1:14:39.970 --> 1:14:40.880
So it's a dream come true.

1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:42.210
- [Interviewer] What's going to happen

1:14:42.210 --> 1:14:43.790
after you finish shooting this film?

1:14:43.790 --> 1:14:46.452
- Well, I won't be going back to Carlisle.

1:14:46.452 --> 1:14:47.760
- [Barry] You're joking!

1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.315
- No, hopefully I'll get another film,

1:14:49.315 --> 1:14:50.865
even if it's just a small part.

1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:56.310
He's in a hurry.

1:14:56.310 --> 1:14:57.560
- [Interviewer] So no plans to work

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:58.830
in a fish and chip shop?

1:14:58.830 --> 1:15:00.853
- No, no.

1:15:02.064 --> 1:15:04.766
You know, I feel like
I've turned a corner.

1:15:04.766 --> 1:15:06.060
My life's where I want it to be.

1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:07.930
- [Interviewer] What kind of
money can you expect to earn

1:15:07.930 --> 1:15:09.463
from working in porn films?

1:15:10.698 --> 1:15:12.260
- It all depends.

1:15:12.260 --> 1:15:14.800
If I work a lot, I could
earn a decent living.

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.040
I mean, some performers go
into directing, producing,

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:17.940
which could be a big earner.

1:15:17.940 --> 1:15:19.265
- [Interviewer] Do you feel-

1:15:19.265 --> 1:15:20.150
[door banging open]

1:15:20.150 --> 1:15:21.258
- [Officer] Police! Nobody move!

1:15:21.258 --> 1:15:23.618
- Everybody put your hands in the air.

1:15:23.618 --> 1:15:25.127
[screaming]

1:15:25.127 --> 1:15:26.350
- Put the gun down, sir.

1:15:26.350 --> 1:15:27.543
- No, you are Immigration, I kill you!

1:15:28.984 --> 1:15:30.571
- Sir, we're not Immigration.

1:15:30.571 --> 1:15:31.734
We're with the Met Pedophile Unit.

1:15:31.734 --> 1:15:32.567
- Still, I kill you!

1:15:32.567 --> 1:15:34.095
- Calm down, what's your name?

1:15:34.095 --> 1:15:36.345
- Get back, I kill you all!

1:15:38.557 --> 1:15:41.434
- I'm too young to die, I
haven't even played Lear yet!

1:15:41.434 --> 1:15:42.934
- [Pimp] Get back!

1:15:47.684 --> 1:15:48.821
- [Officer] Secure that weapon!

1:15:48.821 --> 1:15:49.695
- [Officer] Get that camera off!

1:15:49.695 --> 1:15:53.324
- But we're with the BBC-
- Get it off, now!

1:15:53.324 --> 1:15:55.824
[banjo music]

1:17:29.940 --> 1:17:32.370
- Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed
to be honest with you.

1:17:32.370 --> 1:17:36.087
I mean, I really thought I
was gonna be living the dream.

1:17:36.087 --> 1:17:38.180
- [Interviewer] What happened
to you after the police raid?

1:17:38.180 --> 1:17:41.100
- Well, we were all
arrested and questioned.

1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:42.770
They let most people go after a few hours,

1:17:42.770 --> 1:17:44.283
but they kept me in overnight.

1:17:45.630 --> 1:17:47.230
But then after a while they
let me off with a caution,

1:17:47.230 --> 1:17:49.720
so it all turned out good in the end.

1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:51.673
- [Interviewer] Why did
you come back to Carlisle?

1:17:52.690 --> 1:17:54.500
- Well, with Barry gone,

1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:56.990
there was no way of anyone
getting any money for the shoot,

1:17:56.990 --> 1:17:58.403
so I were broke pretty quick.

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:00.840
I couldn't pay my rent,

1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:03.250
so I had to come back up here.

1:18:03.250 --> 1:18:04.083
- [Interviewer] Will you get another film

1:18:04.083 --> 1:18:05.013
in the porn industry?

1:18:07.260 --> 1:18:08.093
- Maybe.

1:18:10.983 --> 1:18:13.083
But I'm not that bothered,
to be honest with you.

1:18:13.083 --> 1:18:13.916
- [Interviewer] But it's been your dream

1:18:13.916 --> 1:18:15.410
since you were very little, hasn't it?

1:18:15.410 --> 1:18:18.673
- Yeah but, you know how things change.

1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:22.210
I'm sort of happy where I am.

1:18:22.210 --> 1:18:23.220
- [Interviewer] But isn't this exactly

1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:25.370
what you didn't want to
be doing with your life?

1:18:25.370 --> 1:18:27.560
- What, working here you mean?

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:28.393
Yeah but,

1:18:30.530 --> 1:18:32.320
it's only temporary.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:33.760
I mean, we won't be here long.

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:35.210
Although Edon is in prison,

1:18:35.210 --> 1:18:37.540
I still owe his gang two
grand to buy Lien off them,

1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:38.630
but as soon as I've paid the rest of that,

1:18:38.630 --> 1:18:40.180
we'll be out of here, you know.

1:18:41.357 --> 1:18:42.553
We'll get a little place,

1:18:43.870 --> 1:18:46.120
somewhere in the country,
just the two of us,

1:18:47.430 --> 1:18:48.623
start a family.

1:18:50.342 --> 1:18:53.342
It's what I've always wanted, really.

1:18:55.965 --> 1:18:57.343
[Regrets, Secrets by Marcus O'Neill]

1:19:56.905 --> 1:20:00.590
- [Interviewer] Graeme, what
was going through your mind

1:20:00.590 --> 1:20:03.490
when you pushed the light onto
the pimp and saved the day?

1:20:04.385 --> 1:20:06.345
- Oh, that foreign bloke was in the way,

1:20:06.345 --> 1:20:10.675
I just wanted to go out
the fire exit for a fag.

1:20:10.675 --> 1:20:13.050
- [Interviewer] So you didn't intend to-

1:20:13.050 --> 1:20:14.320
- Well I wanted to get him out of the way,

1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:16.400
he was waving that fake gun around,

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.160
and I just wanted him out the way.

1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:20.833
- [Interviewer] You
know it was a real gun?

1:20:24.370 --> 1:20:27.390
And have the cast and crew
been quite grateful to you

1:20:27.390 --> 1:20:28.960
for saving their lives?

1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:31.970
- One of those porn girls
gave me her number I suppose,

1:20:31.970 --> 1:20:34.450
but I'm not really interested.

1:20:34.450 --> 1:20:38.150
- [Interviewer] So a porn
star gave you her phone number

1:20:38.150 --> 1:20:42.024
and you're not, you're not
going to follow that up?

1:20:42.024 --> 1:20:44.024
- No, I'm not into all that.

1:20:46.324 --> 1:20:48.570
- [Interviewer] And what's
your next career move?

1:20:48.570 --> 1:20:51.830
Are you gonna stay with
the adult film industry,

1:20:51.830 --> 1:20:55.057
or has this changed your
opinion of working in porn?

1:20:56.132 --> 1:20:57.940
- I'll just do whatever, you know,

1:20:57.940 --> 1:20:59.350
whatever job comes along.

1:20:59.350 --> 1:21:00.183
It doesn't really matter.

1:21:00.183 --> 1:21:01.372
I don't really pay any attention,

1:21:01.372 --> 1:21:03.289
I just flip the light on,

1:21:04.752 --> 1:21:06.634
flip the light off.

1:21:06.634 --> 1:21:08.463
It's very simple.
