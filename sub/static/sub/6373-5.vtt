00:01.000 --> 00:02.798
<i>[Wilhelmina] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:04.166
I made a terrible mistake.

00:04.237 --> 00:07.673
Did you realize this before or after
Gina dumped you?

00:07.741 --> 00:11.006
It's his HMO.
They're not gonna cover Dad anymore.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.912
Got a weird call from some woman.
She said to ask you

00:14.981 --> 00:17.609
- about Bayonne Scrap Yard.
- Haven't the foggiest.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.084
As long as there's a wedge
between the two of them,

00:20.153 --> 00:21.643
their relationship is doomed.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.554
[Woman] Perhaps it's time
I drive that wedge a little deeper.

00:29.362 --> 00:34.527
[Hip hop music]

00:34.734 --> 00:36.725
Wow, this is so cool.

00:36.803 --> 00:39.966
I've always wanted to come
to Networking Night at The Rack.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.100
- And look! There's free grilled cheese.
- OK, ground rules.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.644
Stop with the chatty.
Don't stand so close to me.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.703
And no one eats the grilled cheese.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.009
She's having one.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.545
Of course Fat Carol is eating one.
What do you expect?

00:52.619 --> 00:54.985
Anyway, so how does this work?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.523
- You have to work the room.
- "Work the room?"

00:57.590 --> 01:00.582
Circulate, baby. Introduce yourself.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.390
We want everyone to meet you.

01:03.463 --> 01:06.660
- OK. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.169
I'm sorry.

01:13.306 --> 01:14.739
It's my first time.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.276
More classic moments
for Betty's wall of shame.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.478
Hi.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.139
Excuse me.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.773
We haven't officially met.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.375
<i>Um, I'm Betty Suarez.
I work at Mode, too.</i>

01:29.289 --> 01:31.814
I always thought
I'd be good at your job.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.586
How long you think you'll last?

01:33.660 --> 01:37.027
Well, unless you know something
that I don't, a while, I hope.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.496
[Chuckles]

01:38.565 --> 01:40.032
That's too bad.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.633
You know, I love that
you're having the grilled cheese.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.694
<i>Most people at Mode don't eat.</i>

01:47.707 --> 01:49.538
Sometimes they shouldn't.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.778
Just a minute.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.384
<i>Carlo Medina. I work with
the Editor-in-Chief at Isabella.</i>

02:01.454 --> 02:04.082
<i>Betty Suarez,
assistant to Daniel Meade at Mode.</i>

02:04.157 --> 02:07.320
Oh, I know who you are.
You're a legend.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.928
Housekeeping swears
they haven't seen a red music box.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.127
Any luck?

02:16.202 --> 02:18.193
Does it look like I've had any luck?

02:18.271 --> 02:20.796
Daniel and Wilhelmina
are still waiting for you

02:20.874 --> 02:23.138
to sign off on the holiday spread.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.076
What? Oh.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.541
Keep looking.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.292
There seem to be a lot of layers.
I'd like to see more skin.

02:43.363 --> 02:47.197
It's a post-nuclear scene. Exposed skin
would melt off their bodies.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.529
[Daniel] My bad.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.831
I understand you've
a holiday spread for me.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.532
Yeah. Yes. We do.
We think you're gonna like it.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.110
In this world of global warming
and political unrest,

02:58.178 --> 03:01.705
we give you...
"A Post-Apocalyptic Christmas."

03:01.781 --> 03:04.011
A "Mad Max-mas" if you will.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.416
I discovered this designer
out of Vietnam, Anh Vu-Tran.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.717
So hot, no one in the States
knows about her.

03:09.789 --> 03:13.657
She's doing an exclusive line
of flak jackets just for us.

03:13.726 --> 03:17.093
Got all props and equipment on hold.
Just need to pull the trigger.

03:17.163 --> 03:19.927
Let's walk through mock-ups,
show you what's in mind.

03:19.999 --> 03:23.298
Yeah, sounds good.
I have to get back upstairs.

03:28.741 --> 03:30.936
[Woman] He was disturbed?

03:31.010 --> 03:33.604
He looked very disturbed.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.547
Mmm. He should.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.607
He got sloppy.

03:39.485 --> 03:42.648
And we got a music box.

03:42.722 --> 03:48.024
- [Chuckling softly]
- [Music playing]

03:49.162 --> 03:53.155
Sorry I'm late. I hope you guys
didn't wait for me to eat dinner.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.667
- What are you doing here?
- Tuesday's tamale night.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.729
- We broke up.
- Walter always comes on tamale night.

04:00.807 --> 04:05.039
He cheated on me. I'm not sure
I'm ready to just jump back in.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.176
- It's tamale night.
- Betty,

04:07.247 --> 04:09.340
I didn't raise you
to be rude to guests.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.248
Now, we saved you some tamales.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.377
OK. Thank you. I'm starving.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.922
I went to this really cool
work thing tonight,

04:16.990 --> 04:20.926
except it's not professional to eat,
so I just had a mango margarita.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.985
Here you go.
Hey!

04:23.062 --> 04:26.190
Dad, you know what the doctor said.
You can't have coffee.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.964
Anyway, so I spent the entire evening
just networking

04:30.036 --> 04:32.163
and giving out my business cards.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.598
- What?
- What? Nothing!

04:34.674 --> 04:37.438
It's just I find it interesting,
you're drinking now.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.603
OK. Used to get woozy
from your astringent.

04:39.679 --> 04:43.775
Anyway, it was really fun.
And I finally felt like I belonged.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.408
- You're a legend.
- Me?

04:46.486 --> 04:49.080
You saved the Fabia layout.
In your first week!

04:49.155 --> 04:51.623
Oh, no. No, no.
No, it didn't happen like that.

04:51.691 --> 04:55.092
I've slaved away for years, and I'm
not even trusted to pick out a belt.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.026
What is your secret?

04:57.096 --> 05:00.088
I'm just, uh, doing my job.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.833
And she's modest too.
[Chuckles]

05:04.904 --> 05:06.132
What are you drinking?

05:06.205 --> 05:07.570
Um...

05:07.640 --> 05:09.471
A mango margarita.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.638
Oh, you should have seen her.
She was so gross.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.375
All she did was talk about herself
the entire night.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.041
That doesn't sound like Betty.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.847
Well, get a drink in her,
and it is the Betty show.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.378
She would not shut up,
bragging about the Fabia layout...

05:24.457 --> 05:25.947
It was all Daniel's vision.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.926
It'd be wrong for me
to take any credit for the layout.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.987
Wow. An assistant who doesn't
trash-talk their boss.

05:32.065 --> 05:36.661
[Chuckling] I know.
Trash-talking is what I do best!

05:36.736 --> 05:39.261
Well, second best.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.500
But it's really easy
when you have a good boss.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.134
You know, I'm really, really lucky
to work for Daniel.

05:44.210 --> 05:48.977
And she was clueless
as to how to handle herself. Shock.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.609
You should've seen when
she pulled out her business cards.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.883
I just got 'em today. I don't usually
carry entire boxes in my purse.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.481
Well, not since Kleenex
came out with the travel size.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.651
[Laughter]

06:00.727 --> 06:03.161
- No, they did.
- Tragic.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.789
They're laughing at you, Betty,
not with you.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.801
Poor cow has no idea we only invited her
so people could see she really exists.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.962
She's like the real life Snuffleupagus.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.665
- Only hairier.
- Marc!

06:13.740 --> 06:16.174
What did you find out
that's useful to me?!

06:16.242 --> 06:21.475
No choice gossip? No dirt to help me
destroy any lesser magazine?

06:21.547 --> 06:24.539
I, uh... [gasping]
I'll do better next time.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.451
Do you know how many curly-haired,
effete sycophants there are

06:31.524 --> 06:33.185
waiting to replace you?

06:33.259 --> 06:35.557
I know you have five of them
on speed dial.

06:35.628 --> 06:36.890
Don't make me call.

06:38.297 --> 06:41.027
[Gasping, swallows]

06:44.670 --> 06:47.264
Anyway, it was an amazing night.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.671
You gonna eat that?

06:49.809 --> 06:54.405
Right. I forgot, you probably
need it to soak up the booze.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.576
You know what? You'd be perfect
for my school project.

06:58.651 --> 06:59.845
What school project?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.719
They gave us an assignment to write
about someone whose job we admire.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.452
We get the whole day off tomorrow
to go observe them.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.857
<i>Can you take me to Mode?</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:10.589
Yeah. Of course.
If it's OK with your mom.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.029
You know, the fashion world
isn't that great.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.432
A bunch of self-serving, shallow tramps
who starve themselves

07:16.502 --> 07:18.902
and backstab each other
for expensive clothes

07:18.971 --> 07:21.599
no self-respecting person
would be caught dead in.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.473
So, can I go?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.341
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.988
Oh, my God. You're a celebrity.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.390
The Meade security guard
knows your name!

07:43.029 --> 07:44.758
Oh, look, here are some of my friends.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.323
Just because we're sharing an
elevator doesn't mean we're friends.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.926
Marc, uh, Amanda, this is Justin.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.732
Oh... So that's pregnancy weight.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.798
No, he's my nephew.

07:58.678 --> 08:03.012
Oh, my God. Manolo Blahnik,
spring 2004.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.572
Oh.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.746
[Gasps] Wearing two-year-old shoes.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.549
Even I didn't catch that.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.285
Definitely not your son.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.621
[Bell dings]

08:14.694 --> 08:16.628
- I got nothing!
- Hey, hey!

08:16.696 --> 08:18.527
Don't take it out on the furniture.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.295
[Man] It's October. I shoot the holiday
spread this week or we won't make book.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.233
- It's the Tube!
- Shh! Justin.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.669
- Sorry.
- Go sit at my desk. It's right there.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.765
I went to go get the tanks... gone!

08:29.842 --> 08:32.970
I went to book the models... gone!

08:33.044 --> 08:35.980
I went to get the burned-out
Christmas tree... gone!

08:36.048 --> 08:38.607
<i>- Isabella took them out from under us.
- Calm down.</i>

08:38.683 --> 08:41.083
How can I calm down?
Somebody leaked our ideas!

08:41.153 --> 08:44.884
<i>Isabella magazine literally stole
our entire feature spread!</i>

08:44.957 --> 08:48.256
- Oh, my God.
- Carlo Medina.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.056
He bought me a drink.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:07.280 --> 09:11.944
<i>Isabella magazine is doing
"A Post-Apocalyptic Christmas."</i>

09:12.018 --> 09:16.717
- They copied our entire concept.
- Didn't just copy it, they took it!

09:16.789 --> 09:20.384
The holiday issue is our biggest source
of ad revenue for the year.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.485
We lose advertisers,
our circulation goes in the toilet.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.863
<i>Which is precisely why Mode
does not tolerate leaks.</i>

09:27.934 --> 09:32.962
Now I will give the guilty party
one chance to come forward and confess.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.507
Did any of you...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.338
...speak to anyone...

09:37.410 --> 09:38.900
<i>...at Isabella?</i>

09:54.527 --> 09:57.121
Well, then, cowards,
we'll do it the hard way.

09:57.196 --> 10:00.927
Everyone is considered guilty,
and will be treated as such,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.900
until there's a confession.

10:03.502 --> 10:06.801
But by noon on Thursday,
someone's head will roll.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.906
See who entered
and exited the building.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.814
I left Fey's music box on my desk
and now it's gone.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.750
Investigate everyone.
We have to find out who took it.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.481
Why didn't you burn it?

10:22.555 --> 10:25.217
I couldn't.
That music box is personal.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.488
But it connects you to Fey.
It could provide a motive.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.428
- Who knows about the affair?
- No one.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.199
No one but my wife.

10:34.600 --> 10:39.936
We have two days to conceive
and execute an entirely new concept.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.839
If any of you have any plans,
I need you to cancel them.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.672
I want everyone working together
to pull this off.

10:45.745 --> 10:49.146
What Daniel's trying to say is
kiss your loved ones goodbye

10:49.215 --> 10:51.080
and expect to come home to dead pets.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.778
- Schmoopy!
- Well? What are you waiting for?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.389
You kicked me!

11:01.460 --> 11:03.724
With your two-year-old shoes!

11:03.796 --> 11:07.254
- [Toilet flushing]
- [Gasps]

11:07.333 --> 11:09.801
Have something to be nervous about,
Carol?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.638
I ate half a bagel.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.774
<i>All three of us talked to Carlo Medina
from Isabella last night.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:21.506
What exactly did you tell him?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.571
Not that much...

11:24.016 --> 11:27.611
So, you can tell me. Is Daniel Meade
a complete incompetent,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.884
or more like a slow but cute
younger brother?

11:30.956 --> 11:34.756
Neither. Daniel is a lot smarter
than people think he is.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.557
Really?
I just find that so hard to believe.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.030
OK, like, Thursday,
we have our feature shoot.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.897
A Post-Apocalyptic Christmas.
It's really cool.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.835
We rented tanks, and
it was all Daniel's idea. The tanks.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.465
[Marc] Ooh, Betty, too bad,
looks like you're the leak.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.702
You didn't really fit in here
anyway. Ta.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.676
Wait, no! All I mentioned were tanks.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.339
- You guys talked to him, too.
- Yeah.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.848
What did you talk to Carlo about?

11:57.917 --> 12:00.909
OK, first of all, he talked to me.

12:02.321 --> 12:06.223
- To assistants!
- [All] Cheers.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.093
What are you doing here, all alone?
That's not like you.

12:11.163 --> 12:15.657
I just don't understand it.
She's like Liza at the pride parade.

the Post-Apocalyptic Christmas spread.

Wilhelmina found the flak jackets.

OK. So, we have tanks
and flak jackets...

12:40.693 --> 12:44.220
I'm guessing the Cosmo fountain
might have spilled something too.

Yes.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.972
So, I guess this means all three of us
need to go to Wilhelmina and confess.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.569
[Both] No, no, no, no, no.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.707
- You been smoking one of your ponchos?
- Nothing to confess.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.115
- Don't know if it was us.
- How can you say that?

13:40.186 --> 13:42.017
We told three parts of a giant shoot.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.851
How'd they find out about
the burned Christmas trees?

Must've been someone else.

OK, that's a lie.

It's like a secret.

is better than getting you guys fired.

26:02.427 --> 26:06.420
This is my father, Ignacio,
and my sister, Hilda.

26:06.498 --> 26:10.400
<i>- Ho-la.
- It's... hola.</i>

26:10.468 --> 26:12.698
No. There's an "h" in it.

26:13.305 --> 26:18.106
Betty, this lotion is made
from crushed diamonds and...

26:18.176 --> 26:21.111
Hey, guys,
I didn't know you were here.

26:21.179 --> 26:25.377
- Nice, you stole the good stuff.
- Justin... Homework.

26:30.422 --> 26:34.222
- Oh, um, Amanda, those are plastic.
- Ew.

26:34.292 --> 26:37.261
Betty, maybe we should
offer your friends a... snack.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.923
- We have flan.
- Oh, what's a flan?

26:39.998 --> 26:43.525
- It's a delicious custard.
- Oh, bring it!

26:44.402 --> 26:49.635
[Jazz music]

26:55.847 --> 26:57.508
How about...

26:57.582 --> 27:02.451
...a Lawrence of Arabia Christmas?
- I don't even know what that means.

27:02.520 --> 27:07.514
It means that we can use the 21 tons
of sand that are already there.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.991
OK, all right. Off that.

27:17.068 --> 27:21.266
The sand... is desert sand, like Africa.

27:21.339 --> 27:25.105
So maybe instead of Christmas,
we do other winter holidays, Kwanzaa?

27:25.176 --> 27:27.406
Did you gesture at me
when you said Kwanzaa?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.741
No!

27:39.257 --> 27:40.918
How about this?

27:41.660 --> 27:46.324
<i>Fey's Sleigh Ride. The biggest-selling
holiday issue in the history of Mode.</i>

27:46.398 --> 27:49.424
- 1986.
- Yeah, I know it well.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.332
Lemme see that.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.830
It's traditional. I like it.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.466
Old is the new "new."

27:58.543 --> 28:01.307
When Fey put herself in the photo,
it sent shockwaves.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.711
No editor ever appeared
in the center spread.

28:03.782 --> 28:09.220
I think, in the year of her death,
an empty sleigh would be a nice tribute.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.026
What do you think?

28:16.094 --> 28:19.063
Yeah. Let's do it.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.891
We're pinning it on Fat Carol.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.559
- What?!
- Have to say something

28:24.636 --> 28:28.037
- when Wilhelmina calls us in.
- Not fair! She didn't do anything.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.371
- You know she calls you "Fat Betty"?
- This is why I hate secrets,

28:31.443 --> 28:33.638
they turn into lies,
which are much worse.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.580
Fat Carol hates her job. Would she eat
so many grilled cheeses if she cared?

28:37.649 --> 28:40.709
Betty, we're doing this for you.
We could get other jobs.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.481
But look at how long it took you
to land this one.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.183
Well, I didn't realize that
keeping so many secrets

28:46.257 --> 28:48.851
was such a big part
of my job description.

28:48.927 --> 28:50.622
Betty...

28:52.163 --> 28:54.791
Do you have another pan
of this stuff?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.406
You're disgusting.

29:05.610 --> 29:08.044
Healthy appetite that girl has.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.405
Don't tell her we have ice cream.

29:17.956 --> 29:20.424
You know, Betty...

29:20.492 --> 29:25.088
...sometimes we have
to keep secrets to survive.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.108
Hold it!

29:51.389 --> 29:54.916
It's too bad about
your Wilhelmina meeting.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.790
We'll miss you around here.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.391
Shut up, Carol.

30:00.465 --> 30:04.925
I don't know if there's rehab
for whatever this is.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.733
But consider it
before starting your job hunt.

30:07.806 --> 30:12.072
And, Betty,
I think I might miss you most of all.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.345
It was nice
having someone fatter than me.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.880
Fat Carol.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.941
Fat Carol.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.014
Fat Carol!

30:28.026 --> 30:30.358
Good morning, Daniel.
Here's your coffee.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.919
I didn't realize
you were gonna come in so early.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.525
Where'd you get that?

30:38.603 --> 30:41.800
Are you OK?
Do you need me to get you something?

30:44.709 --> 30:48.975
When I was 12,
I had the worst Christmas of my life.

30:49.047 --> 30:53.484
My father had just gotten back
from Switzerland,

30:53.551 --> 30:57.783
brought my mom a music box
exactly like this.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.721
She loved it.

30:59.791 --> 31:04.319
A few days later,
she hid the thing in the attic...

31:07.165 --> 31:11.067
<i>...set fire to a thousand copies
of Mode magazine.</i>

31:12.237 --> 31:14.228
No one would ever tell me why.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.671
So, is this your mother's?

31:16.741 --> 31:20.575
No. This appeared here this morning.

31:20.645 --> 31:25.173
Apparently, my father bought
two of them: One for his wife.

31:25.250 --> 31:28.083
And... one...

31:32.824 --> 31:34.416
For his mistress.

31:36.427 --> 31:40.488
That's why Fey put herself
in the feature spread.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.591
She was flaunting the affair
in my mother's face.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.499
I'm sorry, Daniel.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.897
Was there anything inside?

31:52.010 --> 31:54.069
You know the top lifts out.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.081
This woman is trying to connect
your father to Fey Sommers.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.888
She's trying to do more than that.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.293
She's trying to connect my dad
to Fey's death.

32:14.799 --> 32:18.667
I just got back from the studio, there's
still 21 tons of sand sitting there.

32:18.736 --> 32:22.467
Maybe I should go to the Paramus mall
and take pictures of kids with Santa.

32:25.343 --> 32:28.141
No, I know what we can do
with that sand.

32:28.212 --> 32:30.407
Follow me to the Art Department.
Come on.

32:30.481 --> 32:31.709
Wait, Daniel!

32:31.783 --> 32:36.049
You should probably know that I have a
meeting with Wilhelmina in five minutes.

32:37.689 --> 32:42.717
- Really? You?
- Yeah. Me, and Amanda and Marc.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.628
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Not a clue.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.598
Just be careful what you say.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.330
Justin? What are you doing here?

32:56.407 --> 32:58.898
I have to do some more research
for my paper.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.377
Sit down. Thank you, Marc.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.108
<i>- Daniel Meade's office.
- Justin's school called.</i>

33:05.183 --> 33:08.584
- He's not there. Is he with you?
- Yeah, he's right here.

33:08.653 --> 33:12.145
I'm gonna kill him.
I knew this would happen.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.555
<i>The fashion world is no place
for a boy his age!</i>

33:14.625 --> 33:16.957
He said he has to do more work
for his paper.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.189
Wake up, Betty!
There is no paper!

33:19.263 --> 33:21.663
<i>- What?
- Yeah, he made the whole thing up</i>

33:21.733 --> 33:24.964
so he could just ditch school
and spend time in your world.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.628
Well, I didn't know.

33:26.704 --> 33:29.832
I don't know how to deal with it.
Don't know what to do with him.

33:29.907 --> 33:34.435
You tell him that he is in
big trouble when he gets home.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.610
- So you're ditching.
- It's not a big deal.

33:40.685 --> 33:44.018
I'm missing PE and Art.
We're sketching fruit!

33:44.088 --> 33:48.855
That's not the point. Justin, this place
that you think is so glamorous,

33:48.926 --> 33:51.224
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

33:51.295 --> 33:55.231
It's people deceiving each other
and hiding things

33:55.299 --> 33:59.497
and all kinds of stuff
that's not good for a kid to be around.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.539
Someday, maybe you'll end up
working in a place like this.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.132
But you're not gonna
get very far in life by lying.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.806
That is not who we are.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.178
Showtime.

34:17.321 --> 34:19.721
Stay here and don't move.

34:24.128 --> 34:28.188
Shall I ask questions, or do you wanna
just tell me what you know?

34:28.266 --> 34:29.665
Well.

34:29.734 --> 34:34.194
We were all at The Rack
on Tuesday night, and we just realized

34:34.272 --> 34:36.263
that we all saw the same thing.

34:36.340 --> 34:39.536
<i>Someone talking
to Carlo Medina from Isabella.</i>

34:39.610 --> 34:43.444
Now, as much as it hurts us
to rat out our friend,

34:43.514 --> 34:45.277
we have to tell you...

34:45.349 --> 34:48.909
- It was Fat Carol.
- I saw her too.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.284
Fat Carol leaked the spread.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.783
Betty?

34:56.194 --> 34:57.627
Is that what you saw?

35:05.636 --> 35:07.866
No.

35:07.939 --> 35:08.928
It was me.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.906
[Gasping]

35:13.778 --> 35:15.643
I told Carlo everything.

35:29.994 --> 35:31.655
You can go.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.458
What?

35:34.532 --> 35:37.501
- Aren't you going to fire her?
- If I fire her, Amanda,

35:37.568 --> 35:41.834
I'd have to fire all of you.
You're not the only one with informants.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.999
I know exactly what happened.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.067
The three of you might have leaked
a portion of the spread,

35:47.145 --> 35:49.943
but that disgusting Fat Carol

35:50.014 --> 35:53.711
slept with Carlo
and spilled everything.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.651
- He slept with Fat Carol?
- He slept with Fat Carol?

35:56.721 --> 35:59.189
He did what he had to for his magazine.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.090
So, what happens now?

36:02.160 --> 36:05.618
Well, I'll consider the last day
and a half your punishment.

36:06.197 --> 36:10.497
You were drunk, you were horny,
and you were... naive.

36:12.370 --> 36:16.704
Fat Carol, on the other hand,
gave it up intentionally.

36:16.774 --> 36:18.264
She gets the axe.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.042
Now, go before I change my mind.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.775
Go!

36:35.693 --> 36:37.684
It's Christmas in October!

36:39.997 --> 36:44.457
<i>Oh, my God. It's just like Top Model,
except no one's crying.</i>

36:45.736 --> 36:49.399
Sit in that chair and don't talk to
anybody unless they talk to you first.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.337
Wilhelmina told me what happened.

36:51.409 --> 36:55.140
Daniel, I'm sorry... for everything.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.408
You know,
it's OK to hide things sometimes.

36:57.481 --> 37:00.177
Especially if not hiding them means
I might lose you.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.315
Here.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.414
Shoo!

37:09.760 --> 37:11.955
- Nice vest.
- Ralph Lauren.

37:12.029 --> 37:15.590
We got it half price because there's
a small hole, but you can't see it.

37:15.666 --> 37:19.227
So the kids at school... they like it?

37:19.303 --> 37:21.703
No. They don't really get me.

37:23.241 --> 37:28.508
Word of advice:
Be who you are, wear what you want.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.444
Just learn how to run real fast.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.183
[Wilhelmina] All right. Let's go. Marc!

37:34.252 --> 37:35.514
Excuse me.

37:36.654 --> 37:39.646
We need to shoot in five.
Step it up, people.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.521
Hold it!

37:41.592 --> 37:44.026
This isn't the concept I approved.

37:44.095 --> 37:49.362
I've had final say on every
holiday spread for the last 20 years.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.402
Some things came up last minute
that couldn't be avoided.

37:52.470 --> 37:56.304
Our job is to fix the problem, Bradford,
not to burden you with it.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.604
You two are so full of crap.

38:01.412 --> 38:05.644
Lucky for you, it looks quite good.
Maybe even better than Fey's.

38:06.484 --> 38:09.146
- OK. Let's...
- Hold on.

38:10.054 --> 38:12.545
You know, there's one thing missing.

38:18.529 --> 38:21.498
<i>[Music plays]</i>

38:25.970 --> 38:27.403
Where did you find that?

38:28.472 --> 38:30.337
The attic.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.399
I remembered Mom had it.

38:33.911 --> 38:37.608
Looks just like the one Fey had,
don't you think?

38:40.217 --> 38:43.983
Yes. Almost identical.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.387
Good job, son.

38:46.457 --> 38:49.984
OK, can we get this thing going?

My hair is gray and I'm driving to the
early-bird special with my blinkers on.

Isn't that from the old shoot?

38:57.368 --> 38:58.562
Justin!

38:59.537 --> 39:00.868
Say, "snow."

39:03.607 --> 39:05.097
Snow.

39:11.749 --> 39:14.217
Snow is a magical blanket.

I'm sorry, but your father's
not who he says he is.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.967
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- According to our records,

- Not on our end.

been using belongs to somebody else.

You are an underhanded bastard.

A despicable, slimy weasel.
