[loud roaring]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.678
[dramatic music playing]

00:19.686 --> 00:20.979
[roaring]

00:23.648 --> 00:26.526
[Botila] Say goodbye
to your home sweet home.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.986
[laughing maniacally]

00:30.780 --> 00:32.115
[Kong grunts]

00:33.158 --> 00:34.200
[all exclaim]

00:36.077 --> 00:38.204
[roars furiously]

00:38.288 --> 00:41.124
We've done what we came for.
Move out. Now!

00:47.756 --> 00:49.507
-[grunts]
-What?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.633
[Botila grunts]

00:56.014 --> 00:57.474
-[roars]
-[gasps]

00:57.557 --> 00:58.808
[bionobot screeching]

00:59.392 --> 01:00.310
[Kong roars]

01:01.895 --> 01:05.272
Prepare for your destruction.
There's nowhere to hide anymore--

01:05.355 --> 01:06.608
[gasps]

01:06.691 --> 01:08.109
[grunting]

01:11.279 --> 01:13.865
[Jonesy] Man, she really
beat us bad this time.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.743
Ay, por dios, our house...

01:16.826 --> 01:19.370
Botila destroyed everything.

01:19.454 --> 01:24.292
Far from it. What really matters is that
we're all safe and back together again.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.376
[Anita sobs]

01:29.255 --> 01:32.217
Oh, I miss Dr. Remy so much.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.053
We all do.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.095
[Kong grunts]

01:36.638 --> 01:39.265
[sighs] Now what do we do?

01:39.349 --> 01:40.850
Botila made it painfully clear

01:40.934 --> 01:44.646
she plans to empower her AI army
to enslave humanity.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.689
So we have to find a way to stop her.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.485
Right, but first we need to come up
with a new HQ ASAP.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.445
Hey, now that the big guy's

01:52.529 --> 01:55.448
an international
superstar/superhero again,

01:55.532 --> 01:57.492
maybe we can just
move back to Kong Island.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.370
According to the surveillance Amy did
before she left for China,

02:00.453 --> 02:02.372
Botila may be using it as a base.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.041
I'm not sure we're prepared
to face her quite yet.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.292
We need to re-supply.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.752
But remember, we stored
surplus electronics

02:08.836 --> 02:10.045
and survival gear on the island.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.464
We have to go there.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.467
[sighs] All right,
but we have to be careful.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.844
We'll do a fly-by.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.308
[sighs] I am really going
to miss our home.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.018
Hasta luego, Redwoods.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:35.655 --> 02:38.783
I can't believe how sad and lonely
the island looks.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.244
[Kong grunts]

02:41.327 --> 02:44.664
[Jonesy] So far, so good. Scanners aren't
picking up any movement anywhere.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.167
Okay, then. Let's do this.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.879
[Zippi chittering]

02:50.962 --> 02:52.255
[Panchi] Aww.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.258
Sorry, guys, but you'll be safer
in the chopper.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.304
But don't worry, we cracked the windows
so you have plenty of fresh air.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.264
[whimpering]

03:03.641 --> 03:05.059
Jonesy and I'll be over there.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.186
Hopefully, everything is where we left it.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.482
And hopefully the café will have
the cooking supplies and canned goods

03:11.566 --> 03:15.111
I need for my new kitchen...
wherever we end up.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.447
Danny and I will help you, Tía Anita.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.656
[Kong grunts]

03:18.740 --> 03:22.660

[chittering]

03:29.334 --> 03:30.335
[groans]

03:30.418 --> 03:34.213
Aww, poor guy, you must be beat
after everything that's happened.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.133
[exhales deeply]

03:37.217 --> 03:40.470
Go take a nap, buddy.
We'll call you if we need any help.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.481
[snoring]

03:58.154 --> 03:58.988
[monkeys hooting]

[Anita gasps]

04:00.907 --> 04:01.991
[hooting continues]

04:02.784 --> 04:04.202
What is going on?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.620
Let's find out.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.794
It's okay, Anita.
Those bots are harmless.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.463
It's just a bunch of silly monkeys!

04:15.546 --> 04:18.716
[gasps] Those robo-chimps
are messing up my kitchen!

04:18.800 --> 04:19.968
[glass breaking]

04:21.928 --> 04:23.554
-[all gasp]
-Oh, no!

-[Chatter screeching]

04:25.723 --> 04:27.433
[monkeys hooting]

04:28.101 --> 04:29.644
They're Frankenbots!

04:29.727 --> 04:31.354
Mechanical abominations!

04:32.188 --> 04:33.106
Look out!

04:33.189 --> 04:34.774
[Frankenbots hooting]

04:37.193 --> 04:39.404
Quick, grab something
to defend yourself with!

04:41.364 --> 04:42.949
[shrieks]

04:47.412 --> 04:48.246
Batter up!

04:49.914 --> 04:51.624
Oops, strike one...

04:51.708 --> 04:54.460
Danny, this isn't a game. [shrieks]

05:02.260 --> 05:03.177
[Panchi shrieks]

05:03.261 --> 05:06.764
Whoa, they're not monkeying around,
they're trying to kill us!

05:06.848 --> 05:09.267
At least I've got my favorite ladle!

05:10.768 --> 05:12.061
[snoring]

05:21.821 --> 05:25.241
[Jonesy] Whoo! Kong sure did a number
on Richard's bionobot supply.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.160
Looks like a dino graveyard.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.536
[bionobot head growls]

05:28.619 --> 05:29.495
Did you--

05:29.579 --> 05:32.373
-[Danny over comm] Lukas! Jonesy! Help!
-What's wrong?

05:33.249 --> 05:34.500
[Danny] You're not going to believe this,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.836
but we're being attacked
by monkey Frankenbots!

05:37.754 --> 05:38.629
[yelps]

05:39.130 --> 05:42.175
[exclaiming] It's not all bad.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.093
They are throwing us
everything we need.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.181
-[Anita gasps]
-Help us, Lukas!

05:48.264 --> 05:50.308
Don't worry, we're on our way.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.559
It might take a minute!

05:51.642 --> 05:53.227
[bionobot growls]

05:55.813 --> 05:58.816
First, we are going to have to get past
these zombie bionobots.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.068
Come on!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.194
[bionobots shrieking]

06:02.028 --> 06:04.614
[Lukas] And I know exactly who must have
created them.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.410
Botila! Looks like she booby trapped
the entire island.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.828
We're going to need Kong's help.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.080
Kong?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.039
[gasps]

06:13.122 --> 06:14.957
-Kong, can you hear me?
-[Kong snoring]

06:15.041 --> 06:16.000
Kong!

06:18.586 --> 06:21.422
[Botila] No, but I can!

06:21.506 --> 06:23.382
[laughs menacingly]

06:26.260 --> 06:27.637
[clones laughing]

06:35.937 --> 06:37.230
Quiet!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.942
I can hardly hear the humans
screaming in terror!

06:43.694 --> 06:45.154
That's it!

06:45.238 --> 06:47.865
You three are getting
an instant attitude adjustment.

06:47.949 --> 06:51.327
I'm turning the happy dial
in the other direction.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.080
Wait, I like being happy.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.123
I...

06:55.206 --> 06:57.291
Oh... It was overrated.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.001
You're the boss, I guess.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.671
[sighs contentedly] That's better.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.507
No more incessant chirping.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.716
Now, where was I?

07:06.425 --> 07:08.302
Seems I've lost track of the humans.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.805
But I'm sure my AI army has not.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.682
Hmm... Whatever.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.352
There were so many parts left over
from that last battle,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.980
I just had to do something with them.

07:19.063 --> 07:23.443
They are now autonomous and running
on commands to stop Kong and his friends

07:23.526 --> 07:25.528
by any means necessary.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.782
And it looks like one of them
is right on track to take out Kong.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.622
[snoring]

07:39.459 --> 07:40.418
[grunts]

07:46.424 --> 07:47.675

08:01.355 --> 08:02.940
-[Frankenbots hooting]
-We got everything we need!

08:04.066 --> 08:06.027
Hah! Thanks for the supplies.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.493
What are we waiting for?

08:13.576 --> 08:14.744
-Run!
-[Chatter] Bawk!

08:19.540 --> 08:20.875
[Jonesy grunts]

08:21.542 --> 08:23.377
It's showtime. [grunts]

08:27.632 --> 08:28.758
[grunts]

08:36.349 --> 08:37.308
[grunts]

08:37.390 --> 08:38.851
We're seriously outnumbered.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.895
[grunts]

08:50.988 --> 08:51.948
[grunts]

08:56.953 --> 09:00.581
[grunts] These guys won't stop
until they chase us off a cliff.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.166
Huh! Right...

09:18.266 --> 09:19.183
[roaring]

09:27.984 --> 09:29.026
[roars]

09:31.404 --> 09:32.697

[all panting]

09:45.918 --> 09:48.045
[Frankenbots hooting]

09:48.129 --> 09:50.881
What? Now there's flying monkeys!

09:50.965 --> 09:52.758
Things are getting weird...

09:52.842 --> 09:54.760
I won't let you hurt my family.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.137
Get behind me!

10:02.810 --> 10:04.103
-[Frankenbots hooting]
-[yelping]

10:09.275 --> 10:10.651
Kong! Help us!

10:10.735 --> 10:12.486
[roaring]

10:25.875 --> 10:30.004
It looks like Botila must have built these
from scraps, then corrupted their AI.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.548
This way! Over here!

10:33.215 --> 10:35.468
[yelps] Oh, no.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.139
[Frankenbots hooting]

10:40.222 --> 10:41.140
[Lukas] This way.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.936
[Jonesy] Follow us! We've got a plan.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.404
[gasps]

10:58.199 --> 10:59.533
Oh, no

11:00.451 --> 11:01.494
[Anita] It's a dead end!

11:01.577 --> 11:02.411
[Jonesy grunts in exasperation]

11:09.335 --> 11:12.713
Kong may have destroyed my enhanced
monorail defenses,

11:12.797 --> 11:15.591
but he'll never save his humans in time.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.551
Jump! Do it! Jump!

11:18.844 --> 11:19.678
Yes!

11:19.762 --> 11:21.389
[roars]

11:21.472 --> 11:23.766
Yes! Yes! Yes!

11:23.849 --> 11:25.684
[Kong grunting]

11:43.828 --> 11:45.121
[roars]

11:47.957 --> 11:49.417
[Chatter] Bawk!

11:50.751 --> 11:51.836
[Chatter] Bawk!

11:53.629 --> 11:54.463
[all] Kong!

11:57.049 --> 12:00.386
Um... You might want to take another look.

12:03.806 --> 12:04.932
No!

12:05.015 --> 12:06.559
Uh... Yeah.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.936
[Botila] Holo screens off!

12:09.728 --> 12:12.148
Those idiotic AIs were useless.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.693
You doomed all those bots
to the scrap heap.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.903
Yes, and good riddance.

12:17.987 --> 12:23.617
Mine is obviously the master intelligence,
so I must do all the thinking...

12:23.701 --> 12:24.952
For all of you!

12:25.035 --> 12:27.746
We can think for ourselves just fine.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.875
Okay. You can do the thinking.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.711
[Botila] Hmm.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.590
I must find a way to replicate
the mind-body merge I experienced

12:37.673 --> 12:41.719
when I accidentally became one
with the bionobotic squid.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.014
Then no one will ever be able to stop me!

12:46.932 --> 12:47.766
[grunts]

12:48.684 --> 12:49.518
Thanks, bro.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.728
[grunting happily]

12:50.811 --> 12:53.105
We were lucky all our tools
and supplies were still here.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.982
Okay, we're ready to fly.

12:55.065 --> 12:58.819
Hold on! Wait! We're going to need these
where we're going.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.073
[grunts]

13:03.157 --> 13:06.118
What? Refried beans,
they go with everything.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.661
[squawks] Beans!

13:09.747 --> 13:10.748
[chirping excitedly]

13:10.831 --> 13:11.749
[Panchi chuckles]

13:12.583 --> 13:14.502
Good to see you guys too.

13:21.425 --> 13:25.429
Lukas, do you think we'll ever come
back to Kong Island?

13:26.555 --> 13:28.015
I really don't know, Danny.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.646
So where to? Where can we go that
Botila can't track and attack again?

13:33.729 --> 13:36.899
And where on Earth are we supposed
to hide a giant ape?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.151
Nowhere.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.903
So we're going under it.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.905
Back to Kong's birthplace
in the ancient subterranean city.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.240
Oh, yeah!

13:44.323 --> 13:46.075
Assuming the apes will welcome us.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.952
[Kong grunting]

13:49.078 --> 13:51.914
[chuckles] Kong's sure
they'll be happy to have us.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.918
Okay... Then I guess I better
turn this bird around.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.005
[breathes deeply]

14:00.089 --> 14:02.967
Prehistoric underground world,
fiery volcano...

14:03.634 --> 14:04.593
[Anita] What's next?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.353
[Lukas] There it is.
Everyone ready to fly inside?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.896
Yeah!

14:15.980 --> 14:17.481
Sí, ready.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.899
No, not yet!

14:18.983 --> 14:20.317
Almost.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.069
Yes, ready. No!

14:22.152 --> 14:23.362
¡Ay, por dios!

14:23.445 --> 14:26.657
Are you sure it's safe for us?
I've never been so scared.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.658
[squawks]

14:28.450 --> 14:30.286
It's going to be fine, I promise.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.746
You can just close your eyes
until we get there, okay?

14:33.789 --> 14:34.915
Okay.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.294
Jonesy, take us down.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.797
[Lukas] Jonesy?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.549
[gulps]

14:43.632 --> 14:44.925
Just one more minute.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.468
Not you too!

14:46.552 --> 14:49.763
Hey, Jonesy, Lukas or I
can take over the controls...

14:49.847 --> 14:52.182
if you want to close your eyes
with Anita and Chatter?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.729
But Jonesy, you're the best pilot
in the world, so please don't.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.858
[grunts reassuringly]

15:01.817 --> 15:02.651
[exhales sharply]

15:02.735 --> 15:04.695
C'mon, Kong, let's do this!

15:04.778 --> 15:06.322
[grunts in agreement]

15:12.703 --> 15:13.996
[Jonesy] Talk about flying blind!

15:14.079 --> 15:16.165
[Lukas] Just stay in the center.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.333
[Anita exclaims]

15:20.502 --> 15:22.296
-Too late!
-[all scream]

15:23.589 --> 15:25.174
Whoa! Hang on!

15:26.050 --> 15:27.801
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.511
[gulps]

15:30.054 --> 15:31.513
What is happening?

15:32.306 --> 15:33.390
[Danny] It's okay, Anita.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.643
[Lukas] Almost there, guys.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.312
[Panchi gasps]

15:40.439 --> 15:41.273
[gasps]

15:43.400 --> 15:44.234
[Lukas] Wow!

15:45.611 --> 15:48.781
[Jonesy] This place is unbelievable.
This is...

15:49.865 --> 15:50.866
[Panchi] Increíble.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.619
-[Lukas laughing]
-[Jonesy] Oh, wow.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.664
[grunting]

15:57.957 --> 16:01.377
This is nothing, Jonesy,
wait till you see--

16:01.460 --> 16:04.088
-Them! Look out, Jonesy!
-Whoa!

16:05.464 --> 16:07.466
[Anita] Turn left! Turn left!

16:07.549 --> 16:08.509
The other left!

16:10.386 --> 16:11.845
No! Turn right, turn right, Jonesy.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.888
Slow down! Slow down!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.682
Someone else wanna drive?

16:14.765 --> 16:15.641
[all] No!

16:15.724 --> 16:16.809
Well, all right then...

16:22.231 --> 16:23.816
You did it, Jonesy!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.693
[Anita] Good work, Jonesy!

16:25.776 --> 16:28.028
-Never a doubt.
-[laughing]

16:28.529 --> 16:30.698
[sighs] We definitely need
an easier way in and out

16:30.781 --> 16:33.617
if we're really going to set up
our new HQ down here.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.579
-[all gasp]
-What? Again? Hold on!

16:40.541 --> 16:41.750
[all screaming]

16:48.465 --> 16:49.633
Look out!

16:49.717 --> 16:50.884
[all scream]

16:50.968 --> 16:52.094
[roars]

16:57.057 --> 16:58.517
[roars]

17:01.645 --> 17:03.230
-Thanks, Kong.
-Phew!

17:03.313 --> 17:05.566
[grunting]

17:05.648 --> 17:06.858
[screams]

17:06.942 --> 17:07.943
-Pull up!
-Hey!

17:11.571 --> 17:12.823
[dinosaur roaring]

17:12.906 --> 17:14.575
[screaming]

17:15.325 --> 17:16.452
[Panchi] Help!

17:18.954 --> 17:19.954
[dinosaur roars]

17:20.039 --> 17:22.332
-So how much farther?
-Check it out.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.417
Kong's birthplace.

17:24.501 --> 17:29.298
-The ancient City of the Apes.
-Oh, man! Wow!

17:49.068 --> 17:51.445
-Ha.
-[laughing] Told you we'd be back.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.947
Apex says, "It's good to see you."

17:54.031 --> 17:55.574
[chuckles] It's good to see you too.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.580
This is our very good friend, Jonesy.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.793
Tía Anita?

18:06.835 --> 18:08.921
-Oh! Oh!
-[Panchi laughing]

18:09.004 --> 18:11.965
You can open your eyes now.
We're home!

18:12.049 --> 18:13.801
[grunting]

18:15.511 --> 18:17.221
[Anita] Brace yourself.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.306
I sure hope Anita doesn't freak out.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.974
Pfft.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.643
Huh?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.734
-Hey! I can work with this.
-[Chatter squawks]

18:30.818 --> 18:32.736
Just show me where my kitchen will be

18:32.820 --> 18:35.322
and I can cook up
a delicious treat for everyone.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.160
[grunting]

18:40.828 --> 18:45.249
Danny, we forgot about Mamo.
She's the chief cook around here.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.960
And it looks like
she's not into competition.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.513
Uh, Anita, how about we settle into
our new quarters first?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.933
-Good idea.
-Come on, yeah. It's going to be great.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.476
[Danny laughing]

19:09.439 --> 19:13.026
Wow! These are some
super-Kong-sized raisins.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.697
They don't taste like
anything I've ever eaten,

19:16.780 --> 19:18.323
but they are pretty delicious.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.288
I cannot believe anyone
would possibly prefer

19:24.371 --> 19:26.665
hormigas fritas over my buñuelos!

19:27.374 --> 19:29.001
What are hormigas fritas?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.795
-Fried ants.
-[spits] Ugh.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.672
I just ate ants?

19:34.131 --> 19:35.632
Come on, Danny.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.718
We know why gorillas love eating ants.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.597
It makes sense that these more-evolved
apes would enjoy them cooked.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.307
[grunts]

19:43.932 --> 19:45.350
Let Kong be the judge.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.604
What's better?

19:53.609 --> 19:56.236
You're on dangerous ground, bro.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.573
Oh, yeah.
This is clearly a lose-lose deal.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.033
[grunts]

20:01.825 --> 20:04.870
Or a win-win, Kong-style.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.163
[grunts]

20:07.164 --> 20:09.041
I refuse to cook big bugs!

20:09.124 --> 20:11.501
There must be a vegetable garden
around here somewhere.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.046
And if not, I am going to plant one!

20:14.671 --> 20:17.174
Be careful, Anita.
Don't wander too far.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.635
Danny, maybe we should follow her.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.053
[Anita] ¡Que bruto!

20:21.136 --> 20:22.387
Eating ants!

20:22.930 --> 20:25.933
Uh, I think we better let her cool off
a bit first.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.059
[grunts]

20:27.726 --> 20:31.021
I mean, seriously, bugs over buñuelos?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.192
[squeals]

20:35.275 --> 20:36.652
What?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.070
[growls softly]

20:43.408 --> 20:45.410
[gasping]

20:45.494 --> 20:47.120
What's happening?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.956
[meowing]

20:49.039 --> 20:50.457
[yelps]

20:51.250 --> 20:52.334
Oh, no!

20:52.417 --> 20:54.419
[upbeat music playing]
