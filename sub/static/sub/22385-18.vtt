All done.
By midnight tonight,

00:55.004 --> 00:57.270
the FBI team will
no longer be a concern.

00:57.306 --> 00:58.839
Let's hope your friends
are more impressive

00:58.875 --> 00:59.906
than this safe house.

00:59.942 --> 01:01.007
Well, you're the one

01:01.043 --> 01:02.342
who wanted to lay low
after Croatia.

01:02.378 --> 01:05.348
"Lay low," not
"lay in filth."

01:06.517 --> 01:08.148
When the Feds go down,

01:08.184 --> 01:09.449
we can't afford
to have any of it

01:09.485 --> 01:12.085
- splash back on Crawford.
- Don't worry.

01:12.121 --> 01:15.293
These people are as invisible
as they are lethal.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.368
Did I ever tell you about
my predecessor, Frank?

01:27.404 --> 01:29.970
No, but I feel like
you're about to.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.406
Crawford's chief counsel
for 20 years,

01:32.442 --> 01:35.109
until he accidentally
brought a corporate spy

01:35.145 --> 01:36.844
into a meeting he
shouldn't have been in.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.478
The spy had to be dealt
with on the spot.

01:38.514 --> 01:41.752
Ruined Crawford's
favorite shoes.

01:44.053 --> 01:46.254
Frank was banished,
quite literally,

01:46.290 --> 01:49.791
to Siberia to oversee
our interests there.

01:49.827 --> 01:51.159
The shoes were thrown out.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.866
I get it. I'm Frank.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.865
No, you're the shoes.

01:57.901 --> 02:01.401
You might be one of
Crawford's favorite things now,

02:01.437 --> 02:03.140
but...

02:04.374 --> 02:06.043
well...

02:07.377 --> 02:10.181
stay clean, my friend.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.188
(Patterson) I know we're all
on edge after we failed

02:21.224 --> 02:23.424
to take down
Crawford and Roman in Croatia,

02:23.460 --> 02:25.926
but maybe their travel movement
can bear some fruit.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.895
I'm now 97% sure

02:27.931 --> 02:30.301
Crawford's helicopter
escaped from Korcula...

02:31.200 --> 02:32.432
They're airborne.

02:32.468 --> 02:35.436
...to a private airfield
in Montenegro.

02:35.472 --> 02:37.904
We also know that
a Gulfstream G5

02:37.940 --> 02:41.041
flew from there to Moldova
and Moldova to Hong Kong.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.045
Which doesn't have an extradition
treaty with the U.S.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.345
Please tell me
we've got something

02:45.381 --> 02:47.184
from the land Crawford
bought from Bruyere.

02:49.552 --> 02:51.319
I mean, we could,
but we'd be lying.

02:51.355 --> 02:53.454
And Bruyere is dead,
so he's not talking.

02:53.490 --> 02:56.623
It's been two days, and
basically we've got nothing?

02:56.659 --> 02:58.626
Whoo! I haven't had
this many sleepless nights

02:58.662 --> 02:59.863
since I was a Boy Scout.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.331
I was a badge completist.

03:03.367 --> 03:04.998
What the hell
did you think I meant?

03:05.034 --> 03:06.567
Okay, Roman designed
these tattoos

03:06.603 --> 03:09.069
to take down Crawford,
so there's gotta be

03:09.105 --> 03:10.470
- something in them we can still use.
- You know, I hate to be

03:10.506 --> 03:12.039
a bit of a
Doubtful Deborah here,

03:12.075 --> 03:14.474
but Roman's been established
as a bit of a control freak.

03:14.510 --> 03:15.543
I mean, he designed
these new tattoos

03:15.579 --> 03:17.211
to require his help,
so if we don't

03:17.247 --> 03:18.980
have his cheat codes,
we're kinda screwed.

03:19.016 --> 03:22.116
(electronic tone)

03:22.152 --> 03:23.350
Is that a break
in the case?

03:23.386 --> 03:24.551
No. No, it's nothing.

03:24.587 --> 03:26.152
All right.

03:26.188 --> 03:27.521
How long has Roman
been flying

03:27.557 --> 03:29.156
around the world
as "Tom Jakeman"?

03:29.192 --> 03:30.957
(Patterson)
Roman has done a stellar job

03:30.993 --> 03:33.361
covering up his tracks.
I can't say for sure

03:33.397 --> 03:35.229
when he first
stole the identity.

03:35.265 --> 03:37.497
Maybe you can check the
Australian military records.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.366
I've checked
his military records.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.101
I've checked his hospital
records, school records,

03:41.137 --> 03:43.570
driving records. I've even
checked his Spotify account,

03:43.606 --> 03:46.273
looking for any changes
in his listening habits.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.607
There's got to be
a lead there.

03:47.643 --> 03:49.509
We're just not gonna
find it quickly.

03:49.545 --> 03:51.111
Okay. Let's go home,
get some rest,

03:51.147 --> 03:52.313
and regroup in the morning
with some fresh eyes.

03:52.349 --> 03:53.546
- All right?
- (Rich) Um...

03:53.582 --> 03:55.916
I'm still getting
reimbursed for this, right?

03:55.952 --> 03:58.252
(Weller) All right, what are
you in the mood for tonight?

03:58.288 --> 04:00.521
Thai or Italian?
Hmm?

04:00.557 --> 04:03.257
Roman's still out there,
protecting Crawford,

04:03.293 --> 04:05.392
planning God-knows-what.
Kurt, I can't just...

04:05.428 --> 04:06.694
- I have to...
- Have to eat?

04:06.730 --> 04:10.264
Yes, you do. So, what
are we gonna order in?

04:10.300 --> 04:12.265
- Thai? Italian?
- Order in?

04:12.301 --> 04:14.034
When was the last time
you two went out

04:14.070 --> 04:15.438
as a couple on the town?

04:16.640 --> 04:19.440
You see that?
That's not good.

04:19.476 --> 04:23.010
You know what you two need
is a little Mr. Velvet.

04:23.046 --> 04:25.412
- Is that a sex thing?
- No, it's not a sex thing,

04:25.448 --> 04:28.149
although...
No, no, no.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.650
It's the hottest
new hotspot in town.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.551
Impossible to get
a reservation unless you have

04:31.587 --> 04:33.553
connections and/or extensive
hacking acumen,

04:33.589 --> 04:36.424
both of which I happen
to have in spades.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.025
There you go. Table for two,
9:00 tonight.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.226
Best seat in the house, too.

04:40.262 --> 04:41.494
That's where
Jay-Z and Beyoncé sat

04:41.530 --> 04:43.197
- the night they...
- Thank you, Rich, but, uh,

04:43.233 --> 04:46.000
- we're good with take-out.
- Also, I used your credit card

04:46.036 --> 04:47.702
to secure the reservation,
so if you don't show up,

04:47.738 --> 04:49.303
they charge you
400 bucks for canceling,

04:49.339 --> 04:51.475
so <i>bon appétit.</i>

04:55.611 --> 04:57.044
- Uh...
- Wow.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.950
(laughs)
Thanks.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.748
- Thank you.
- (clears throat)

05:01.784 --> 05:03.250
I don't know whether
I should drink this

05:03.286 --> 05:05.085
or use it to recharge
my cell phone.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.186
(laughs)

05:06.222 --> 05:07.590
Uh...

05:09.592 --> 05:10.590
to us.

05:10.626 --> 05:12.028
To us.

05:16.599 --> 05:19.599
(groans)

05:19.635 --> 05:22.202
Someone zip me again so I can
forget what that tastes like.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.205
What were we thinking,
taking life advice from Rich?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.474
Rich wasn't all wrong.

05:27.510 --> 05:30.210
These cases have
taken over our lives.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.544
It's all my fault.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.513
I should have never
let Roman go.

05:33.549 --> 05:37.084
It was a team decision not
to take him down in Croatia.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.085
We had to
prioritize Crawford.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.222
I'm not talking about Croatia.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.657
If I hadn't let him go
two years ago in DC,

05:43.693 --> 05:46.363
we wouldn't have
a Roman problem right now.

05:47.563 --> 05:49.630
If we'd got Roman in DC,

05:49.666 --> 05:51.231
then Crawford would still
be calling the shots

05:51.267 --> 05:53.133
at the FBI through Hirst.

05:53.169 --> 05:56.369
Besides,
these new tattoos

05:56.405 --> 05:59.707
brought us back together
after Colorado, didn't they?

05:59.743 --> 06:03.376
If you hadn't
let Roman go then,

06:03.412 --> 06:06.082
we might not
be together now.

06:09.186 --> 06:11.385
That, uh...
That woman at the bar.

06:11.421 --> 06:14.455
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I saw her

06:14.491 --> 06:16.323
outside of our apartment
this morning.

06:16.359 --> 06:17.690
How sure?

06:17.726 --> 06:19.397
70%?

06:20.464 --> 06:22.263
She came in
right after we did.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.397
She's been nursing
the same glass of wine

06:23.433 --> 06:26.103
for the last half hour.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.537
(sighs)

06:29.573 --> 06:32.339
Listen to me. I can't even
have a normal night out

06:32.375 --> 06:33.808
without getting suspicious
of someone.

06:33.844 --> 06:36.680
- It's what I love about you.
- Hmm.

06:44.721 --> 06:46.486
She could be going
to the bathroom.

06:46.522 --> 06:49.556
No, the bathroom's
that way.

06:49.592 --> 06:51.157
That's the back exit.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.561
Of course you would clock
where all the exits are.

06:53.597 --> 06:55.695
So, here's how I see it.

06:55.731 --> 06:58.465
We either pursue that woman
that might be casing us

06:58.501 --> 07:02.436
or we finish
this lovely meal.

07:02.472 --> 07:05.575
Check, please.
(laughs)

07:06.842 --> 07:08.609
Okay. So, I'll tail her
out the back.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.878
Okay. I'll head out the front,
double back and cut her off.

07:10.914 --> 07:12.483

I'd actually like

The longer you're here,

till I crack it,

10:18.184 --> 10:21.054
and when I do, you can bet
I'll be talking to you.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.893
Can't wait.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.849
(Millicent)
Taxi! Taxi!

10:49.216 --> 10:53.585
Ooh! Ah! Trying to steal
my cab now, Assistant Director?

10:53.621 --> 10:56.186
Nope. All yours.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.656
Yes, it is,
because I hailed it.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.258
If you're heading home,
I'm going in the same direction.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.661
Which means you know
where I live.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.797
Which means it's cold out
and I don't see any cabs around,

11:06.833 --> 11:09.570
so why don't we be grown-ups
and share one?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.940
Okay.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.144
Thank you.

11:25.019 --> 11:26.950
(sighs)
Confession.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.953
I sometimes use
the parental control timer

11:28.989 --> 11:31.155
on my cell to force me
to put the phone down.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.825
A little tip I picked up
from "The 700 Club."

11:33.861 --> 11:35.963
Do you watch
"The 700 Club"?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.830
You know I'm just
doing my job, right?

11:39.866 --> 11:40.964
Absolutely.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.700
Despite what
you may think,

11:42.736 --> 11:44.368
I'm not on a crusade
against you.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.405
It's my job to assume
corruption exists everywhere

11:47.441 --> 11:48.839
until proven otherwise.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.240
Just like
the Constitution says...

11:50.276 --> 11:52.977
guilty until
proven otherwise.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.013
When the FBI
goes unchecked,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.982
people like Hirst
get into power

11:58.018 --> 11:59.282
and then they abuse
that power.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.418
We both want
a corruption-free FBI.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.354
I'm all for corruption-free.
That's not what this is.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.124
This is about how your office
dropped the ball on Hirst.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.127
Everyone dropped
the ball on Hirst.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.162
It's not everyone's job
to make sure people like her

12:11.198 --> 12:14.032
don't end up running the
entire Bureau... it's yours.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.867
You're dogging me
because you screwed up.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.167
That is a gross
misrepresentation.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.403
And you know what?
I'm not your target.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.805
I'm your scapegoat.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.706
This was a bad idea.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.145
Here is fine.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.021
(cell phone vibrating)

12:44.798 --> 12:48.036
(breathing heavily)

12:53.340 --> 12:56.407
Hey, babe, it's me.
I know you're working late,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.442
but give me a call back.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.778
I'm sorry about earlier.
I was a little short with you.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.983
I've just been super busy
and I think I've been...

13:06.019 --> 13:07.918
a little wedding planned out.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.320
Um...

13:09.356 --> 13:11.189
but I love the tablecloths
you picked out

13:11.225 --> 13:13.224
and I think
they're gonna look great.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.696
Uh...

13:16.163 --> 13:17.394
I love you.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.765
Bye.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.372
(intercom ringing)

13:26.973 --> 13:28.906
(ringing)

13:28.942 --> 13:30.240
Yeah?

13:30.276 --> 13:33.009
(Millicent) <i>Please don't let
go of the button, please.</i>

13:33.045 --> 13:34.244
Millicent?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.947
<i>I know you're not the
happiest with me right now,</i>

13:36.983 --> 13:39.083
<i>but in my rush
to get out of the cab,</i>

13:39.119 --> 13:40.984
<i>I forgot my purse,
and my keys</i>

13:41.020 --> 13:42.018
<i>and my phone were in it.</i>

13:42.054 --> 13:43.888
<i>I need to call a locksmith.</i>

13:43.924 --> 13:45.760
<i>Can I please come up?</i>

13:49.529 --> 13:52.964
Yes, it's on the
Upper Westside. Thank you.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.833
Now, is that fee
per lock or per job?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.100
(laughs)

13:57.136 --> 14:00.403
Oh! No, no, no.

14:00.439 --> 14:03.007
They say it's gonna be
45 minutes.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.975
Okay, that's fine.
I'll be there.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.243
(sighs)

14:06.279 --> 14:08.012
Uh, 45 minutes?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.546
I can wait outside
my apartment.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.019
It's just cold.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.118
All right, hold on.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.186
Um, I can't let you
loiter outside

14:16.222 --> 14:17.522
on a city block
with no phone or keys

14:17.558 --> 14:21.124
in this weather,
so you can wait here.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.127
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.198
I swear I won't be
an imposition.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.839
I don't mean to make
people uncomfortable.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.542
There's plenty of space
here for the both of us.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.210
I mean, at the office,

14:40.246 --> 14:42.479
but you're not wrong.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.547
About?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.184
About OPR missing Hirst.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.286
About me impeding cases.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.088
I know the effect I have
on people and, frankly,

14:51.124 --> 14:53.324
I hate it.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.561
It kills me to think I'm
hindering active investigations.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.229
Does that mean
you'll drop it?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.067
You know I can't do that.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.335
But I can offer you
a compromise.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.308
An easy way to resolve this.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.577
- Resign.
- (laughs)

15:13.045 --> 15:15.613
I fail to see how me quitting
when I did nothing wrong

15:15.649 --> 15:17.181
qualifies as a compromise.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.550
Consider this a courtesy.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.387
On my desk right now
is a letter to the DOJ

15:23.423 --> 15:25.355
recommending you be
suspended immediately

15:25.391 --> 15:27.190
and a criminal
investigation opened.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.459
Are you serious?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.194
Routine interviews
only get so much.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.494
Sometimes you need
more ammunition.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.330
Oh, so you already
made your mind up about me

15:33.366 --> 15:35.532
without even interviewing me
and now you're in my home,

15:35.568 --> 15:37.133
knowing that letter's
on your desk?

15:37.169 --> 15:38.235
It's part of the process.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.469
This is part of the process?

15:39.505 --> 15:40.604
Out of all the people
you interviewed,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.205
did you get any
complaints about me?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.474
- Well, no.
- Is the New York office excelling

15:44.510 --> 15:46.377
- under my leadership?
- Yes, by many measures,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.878
- it appears you...
- Do you even have

15:47.914 --> 15:48.945
any evidence right now

15:48.981 --> 15:50.114
that I did anything illegal?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.349
If you haven't done
anything illegal,

15:51.385 --> 15:53.618
then you've got
nothing to worry about!

15:53.654 --> 15:56.888
You know damn well that
even if it brings up nothing,

15:56.924 --> 15:58.122
a criminal investigation

15:58.158 --> 15:59.489
means the end of
my career at the FBI.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.959
You want to do me
a real courtesy?

16:01.995 --> 16:05.162
You rip up that letter and you start
fresh with me in the morning.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.098
No preconceived notions,
no scapegoating.

16:07.134 --> 16:11.035
Just two people sitting down, having
an honest, unbiased interview.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.936
That's all I ask.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.907
(phone vibrating)

16:15.943 --> 16:17.041
Excuse me.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.009
(sighs)
Is that your restroom?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.244
- Yeah. Door on the left.
- Fine.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.245
It's Reade.

16:22.281 --> 16:26.316
<i>This is the NYPD liaison
to the FBI,</i>

16:26.352 --> 16:27.517
<i>calling to inform you
that we received</i>

16:27.553 --> 16:30.521
<i>a distress call involving
Special Agent Zapata.</i>

16:30.557 --> 16:31.455
Where? When?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.657
<i>She's currently under fire</i>

16:32.693 --> 16:34.425
<i>at Immaculate
Conception Church.</i>

16:34.461 --> 16:36.993
Hey, Millicent, there's
an emergency with my team.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.565
- I gotta go.
- (thud)

16:40.100 --> 16:41.335
Millicent?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.407
(grunting)

16:58.116 --> 17:00.257
(Jane) Maybe you can check the
Australian military records.

17:00.293 --> 17:01.915
(Patterson) I've checked
his military records.

17:01.951 --> 17:03.604
I've checked
his hospital records,

17:03.640 --> 17:05.138
school records,
driving records.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.773
I've even checked
his Spotify account,

17:06.810 --> 17:09.644
looking for any changes
in his listening habits.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.378
There's got to be
a lead there.

17:11.415 --> 17:12.513
We're just not gonna
find it quickly.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.315
Okay. Let's go home,
get some rest,

17:14.351 --> 17:16.450
and regroup in the morning with
some fresh eyes, all right?

17:16.486 --> 17:17.852
(Weller)
Yeah.

17:17.887 --> 17:20.155
Hey, I'm still getting
reimbursed for this, right?

17:20.191 --> 17:23.358
- Hey, Reade.
- Ooh. <i>Uno momento, por favor.</i>

17:23.394 --> 17:24.693
I know you saw
what Reade just saw,

17:24.729 --> 17:26.194
but maybe let Uncle Richie

17:26.230 --> 17:27.661
deal with Agent Three-Piece
on this one.

17:27.696 --> 17:29.363
- Wrong time for your games, Uncle Richie.
- Ooh!

17:29.399 --> 17:30.532
I kind of like
when you say it,

17:30.568 --> 17:32.167
but, uh, honestly,
I think people

17:32.203 --> 17:33.735
around here might still
be sore about the whole

17:33.771 --> 17:35.603
"I knew Borden was alive
and didn't tell anybody

17:35.639 --> 17:37.438
about it" thing, so maybe
now is not the best time

17:37.474 --> 17:38.740
to be offering
one-on-one counseling.

17:38.776 --> 17:40.242
- I wasn't...
- Okay, look. When I was king

17:40.278 --> 17:41.877
of the dark web,
between all the hangers-on

17:41.913 --> 17:43.744
and sycophants, I didn't know
who my real friends were,

17:43.780 --> 17:45.914
but then I lost everything,
went to jail,

17:45.950 --> 17:48.183
and finally found my people,

17:48.219 --> 17:50.784
but I pissed them off, too,
pulled a real Zapata,

17:50.820 --> 17:53.155
and ended up the most
hated man in Cell Block D.

17:53.191 --> 17:54.421
Are you done?

17:54.457 --> 17:55.689
How did I get people
to forgive me?

17:55.725 --> 17:57.425
That's an excellent
question. I didn't.

17:57.461 --> 17:59.360
I ended up
in solitary confinement,

17:59.396 --> 18:00.494
and when that got dull,
I left.

18:00.530 --> 18:01.596
I came here.
Never went back.

18:01.632 --> 18:02.898
So, you want me to
abandon everything

18:02.934 --> 18:04.299
- and start over somewhere else.
- No, no, no.

18:04.335 --> 18:05.433
I just want you to realize

18:05.469 --> 18:06.735
things will
go back to normal.

18:06.771 --> 18:08.570
Just give it some time.
You know what?

18:08.606 --> 18:11.809
Maybe enjoy a little
solitary of your own.

18:16.947 --> 18:19.517
(Rich) We've got a
Millicent problem.

18:41.638 --> 18:43.207
(phone vibrating)

18:58.822 --> 19:00.191
Tasha.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.427
Alexis.
I almost didn't...

19:05.463 --> 19:08.830
I... I'll, uh, I'll go.

19:08.866 --> 19:12.871
No, please. My brother would
be touched that you're here.

19:14.038 --> 19:16.838
Yeah, well, I'm not
so sure about that.

19:16.874 --> 19:19.908
I am. Who do you think left
that flyer on your windshield?

19:19.944 --> 19:21.376
(laughs)

19:21.412 --> 19:22.776
I thought it was a ticket.

19:22.812 --> 19:24.579
Yeah, I should have
given you one of those, too.

19:24.615 --> 19:26.447
You still park like a cop.

19:26.483 --> 19:27.715
How do you think
Ricky would feel

19:27.751 --> 19:29.317
about you putting on
that uniform?

19:29.353 --> 19:30.517
Probably
the same way he felt

19:30.553 --> 19:32.223
about you putting on yours.

19:33.357 --> 19:34.593
(laughs)

19:36.894 --> 19:39.460
I just graduated
from the academy.

19:39.496 --> 19:41.599
I'm still doing
field training.

19:49.807 --> 19:51.740
I used to look up
to you both so much.

19:51.776 --> 19:54.475
Then you put on a uniform
and escaped the neighborhood

19:54.511 --> 19:56.477
and, uh, Ricky
put on gang colors

19:56.513 --> 19:59.046
and died here, so...

19:59.082 --> 20:01.683
it's pretty clear whose
footsteps I should follow.

20:01.719 --> 20:03.485
Yeah, well, the only
thing about escaping

20:03.521 --> 20:05.820
from somewhere is,
it's, uh,

20:05.856 --> 20:08.790
- hard to get back.
- Come on.

20:08.826 --> 20:11.426
- (violin music)
- It's starting.

20:11.462 --> 20:14.566
♪♪

20:23.540 --> 20:26.910
Thanks to everyone who shared
their memories of Ricky tonight.

20:27.845 --> 20:29.777
All right, last call.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.983
Anyone else
want to say something?

20:46.463 --> 20:47.594
(exhales)

20:47.630 --> 20:51.533
New Year's Eve,
senior year,

20:51.569 --> 20:53.735
we were on our way
to a party

20:53.771 --> 20:58.806
when Ricky leads me down
this dead-end street

20:58.842 --> 21:01.943
and it was just us

21:01.979 --> 21:05.714
under one of those
digital billboards,

21:05.750 --> 21:09.617
adding up
the number of deaths

21:09.653 --> 21:12.687
from smoking this year.
Yeah.

21:12.723 --> 21:13.987
I thought he had
the wrong address.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.559
I thought,
this is so Ricky.

21:17.595 --> 21:19.727
- (laughter)
- And we can hear people

21:19.763 --> 21:22.831
counting down to midnight
in the distance,

21:22.867 --> 21:27.569
and I'm thinking,
we missed it.

21:27.605 --> 21:31.406
And then,
when they get to one,

21:31.442 --> 21:34.141
Ricky turns to me
and tells me to look up

21:34.177 --> 21:37.978
just as the billboard
resets to zero,

21:38.014 --> 21:42.082
and then he turns to me
and he says,

21:42.118 --> 21:44.621
"To new beginnings."

21:45.955 --> 21:48.022
Ricky took
the least romantic spot

21:48.058 --> 21:50.725
in all of New York
and made it special.

21:50.761 --> 21:54.031
We never lasted long
as a couple...

21:55.532 --> 21:58.869
but we did as friends,
until...

22:00.905 --> 22:03.808
I'm so sorry, Ricky.
(crying)

22:04.774 --> 22:06.474
I knew you were
in a bad place,

22:06.510 --> 22:09.914
and I stopped knowing
how to be there for you.

22:11.816 --> 22:16.016
I'm sorry
I gave up on you.

22:16.052 --> 22:19.486
I know what
that feels like now,

22:19.522 --> 22:21.091
and it's not good.

22:31.068 --> 22:33.167
I thought you might
want to hang on to this.

22:33.203 --> 22:36.040
The uniform suited you.

22:39.210 --> 22:42.042
I don't think I recognize
that girl anymore.

22:42.078 --> 22:45.914
Hey, uh, any advice
for a rookie cop?

22:45.950 --> 22:49.050
Yeah. Make sure you join
for the right reasons,

22:49.086 --> 22:51.186
'cause the wrong ones
don't end well.

22:51.222 --> 22:52.520
- (gun cocks)
- Like?

22:52.556 --> 22:54.092
- Down!
- (gunfire)

22:56.827 --> 22:58.493
10-10, shots fired.
Officer in trouble.

22:58.529 --> 23:00.895
Immaculate Conception Church.
Send assistance now!

23:00.931 --> 23:03.997
(female dispatcher) <i>Requestor,
please identify yourself.</i>

23:04.033 --> 23:06.801
This is Special Agent
Tasha Zapata.

23:06.837 --> 23:08.535
I'll run out,
draw his fire,

23:08.571 --> 23:10.804
while you slide into position
under the balcony and shoot up.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.872
You want me to what?

23:11.908 --> 23:13.675
Shoot him
while I distract him.

23:13.711 --> 23:15.542
You can do this, Alexis.

23:15.578 --> 23:16.945
This is what you've
been training for.

23:16.981 --> 23:19.214
On three, okay?
One...

23:19.250 --> 23:21.148
two... three!

23:21.184 --> 23:24.521
(gunfire)

23:33.664 --> 23:34.866
(groans)

23:40.870 --> 23:42.637
(phone vibrating)

23:42.673 --> 23:45.844
(both grunting)

23:59.924 --> 24:01.893
(phone vibrating)

24:03.293 --> 24:04.158
Tasha, you okay?

24:04.194 --> 24:06.293
I've just been attacked.
Professional hit.

24:06.329 --> 24:07.594
I barely got out alive.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.264
Me, too, which means...

24:09.300 --> 24:11.064
Which means the whole team
could be in danger.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.001
<i>Any word on Patterson,
Jane, or Weller?</i>

24:13.037 --> 24:15.602
The last I saw Patterson,
she was going

24:15.638 --> 24:16.870
to the Henning
Culinary Center.

24:16.906 --> 24:19.741
That's not far from me.
I'm heading there now.

24:19.777 --> 24:23.144
(siren)

24:23.180 --> 24:25.280
(Patterson's voicemail)
<i>Hey, you've reached Patterson.</i>

24:25.316 --> 24:28.185
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

24:29.319 --> 24:31.054
(explosion)

24:33.323 --> 24:34.731
Patterson.

24:39.647 --> 24:41.512
(electronic tones)

24:41.548 --> 24:42.917
Is that a break
in the case?

24:44.485 --> 24:47.555
Uh, no. No, it's nothing.

24:55.295 --> 24:57.395
Oh, man,
this shirt's ruined.

24:57.431 --> 25:00.031
Well, you know what?
It was worth it.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.400
What is going on here?

25:01.436 --> 25:03.402
Did you steal clothes
out of someone else's locker?

25:03.438 --> 25:05.437
Don't start, Rich,
please. Not tonight.

25:05.473 --> 25:08.340
It's a compliment. I'm saying
you look nice for once.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.008
- I have a date.
- Oh, my God!

25:10.044 --> 25:12.277
I... I had no idea.
It's great.

25:12.313 --> 25:14.145
I kind of assumed
you'd closed up shop

25:14.181 --> 25:16.547
after, uh,
"he who shall not be named."

25:16.583 --> 25:18.450
Borden.
I'm talking about Borden.

25:18.486 --> 25:19.617
Thank you for that.

25:19.653 --> 25:20.451
So, who's the new guy?

25:20.487 --> 25:22.421
I mean, you're getting
dressed at work,

25:22.457 --> 25:23.989
so is it somebody
from the office?

25:24.025 --> 25:25.289
Give me a hint.
Is it me?

25:25.325 --> 25:28.360
If I tell you, will you
please stop talking?

25:28.396 --> 25:30.295
I don't see
how I could promise that.

25:30.331 --> 25:34.432
Okay.
It's Jack from Forensics.

25:34.468 --> 25:36.601
Dr. Izenberg?
Oh, he's cute!

25:36.637 --> 25:39.037
He's like powder
with hair and eyebrows.

25:39.073 --> 25:41.605
- I think he has a podcast, too.
- Rich!

25:41.641 --> 25:43.240
Have you
Facebook-stalked him yet?

25:43.276 --> 25:44.442
That's vital in
today's dating climate.

25:44.478 --> 25:46.979
Oh, my God.
You need to relax.

25:47.015 --> 25:48.512
This is just a first date.

25:48.548 --> 25:51.182
There's no such thing
as "just a first date."

25:51.218 --> 25:52.584
You gotta take this
seriously.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.086
No second-guessing,
no self-sabotage.

25:55.122 --> 25:56.688
- I'm not doing any of that.
- Not yet.

25:56.724 --> 25:59.190
But the second something gets
sticky, you definitely will.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.624
That's what happens when
people are out of practice.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.460
They get frustrated,
they blame themselves,

26:02.496 --> 26:04.462
they make excuses,
and then pfft!

26:04.498 --> 26:06.465
- Everything shuts down permanently.
- Whoa!

26:06.501 --> 26:08.700
This is the first first date
of the rest of your life.

26:08.736 --> 26:10.469
Promise me
it won't be your last.

26:10.505 --> 26:13.204
You are being so dramatic,
okay?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.273
You do look really nice,
by the way.

26:15.309 --> 26:16.607
(groans)
You're the worst.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.776
Hey, you know,
he works in Forensics,

26:17.812 --> 26:19.377
so maybe find a scent
that matches

26:19.413 --> 26:21.048
- with formaldehyde?
- Awesome.

26:22.516 --> 26:24.482
- Hey! (laughs)
- Hey!

26:24.518 --> 26:26.684
You ready for some
molecular gastronomy?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.787
Hells, yeah.
Using liquid nitrogen

26:28.823 --> 26:30.756
to make ice cream...
sign me up.

26:30.792 --> 26:33.725
- I already did.
- Great.

26:33.761 --> 26:36.127
They say the cream
crystallizes so fast,

26:36.163 --> 26:38.430
so perfectly, it's the
smoothest you'll ever taste.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.232
Well, good, 'cause I
hate rough ice cream.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.371
- (laughs)
- (bell dings)

26:44.405 --> 26:46.537
Oh, tiny thing...
I got the Groupon

26:46.573 --> 26:47.671
back when I was
with my ex,

26:47.707 --> 26:50.241
so if anyone asks,
your name is Diane.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.679
(laughs)

26:55.283 --> 26:58.383
(instructor)
Good, good.

26:58.419 --> 27:01.652
You want a nice,
smooth consistency.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.690
(both chuckle)

27:04.725 --> 27:05.790
This is fun, right?

27:05.826 --> 27:06.691
Yeah, yeah.

27:06.727 --> 27:08.692
You don't have to keep
asking me that.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.461
I'm having
a very good time.

27:10.497 --> 27:12.667
- Do you want to switch?
- No. I'm good.

27:14.735 --> 27:16.267
Are you sure?

27:16.303 --> 27:19.171
Yeah. Do you
want to switch?

27:19.207 --> 27:20.675
Oh. Only if you do.

27:22.576 --> 27:24.678
- Uh, you know what? Let's switch.
- Okay.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.480
(instructor) And now it's
time for the science.

27:29.516 --> 27:31.450
Add the flavoring
to the cream

27:31.486 --> 27:34.419
and then grab your gloves
and your goggles.

27:34.455 --> 27:37.823
Wait. So, is it true
that you have a podcast?

27:37.859 --> 27:39.690
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

27:39.726 --> 27:43.194
- It's about Bigfoot.
- (laughs)

27:43.230 --> 27:45.831
That's funny. Oh.

27:45.867 --> 27:47.833
- I'm so sorry. You're serious.
- Yeah.

27:47.869 --> 27:49.601
A buddy and I, we look
at all the evidence

27:49.637 --> 27:52.437
and try to see where
truth meets fiction.

27:52.473 --> 27:55.172
But you're...
you're a scientist.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.307
(laughs)

27:56.343 --> 27:57.808
You sound just
like Diane.

27:57.844 --> 28:01.446
(instructor) Now, one of
you, slowly and evenly

28:01.482 --> 28:03.347
pour the liquid nitrogen
into the mix

28:03.383 --> 28:05.653
while the other stirs.

28:06.754 --> 28:08.385
- Okay, I'll...
- Here it comes.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.092
Okay.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.190
All righty.
Slowly.

28:12.226 --> 28:13.391
I can't control it.

28:13.427 --> 28:14.758
Well, no, I just...
I want to make sure...

28:14.794 --> 28:16.327
I feel like you're pouring it
a little bit too fast.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.662
Can you stir
a little faster?

28:17.698 --> 28:18.864
I want to make sure
that the nitrogen...

28:18.900 --> 28:21.466
(explosion)

28:21.502 --> 28:22.771
You okay, Diane?

28:24.906 --> 28:26.637
Yeah, yeah.

28:26.673 --> 28:28.773
Just peachy, thank you.

28:28.809 --> 28:30.479
I'm gonna...

28:35.382 --> 28:37.481
- Again, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

28:37.517 --> 28:38.850
It's okay, it's okay.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.785
- If you want to go home...
- No, no, no, no, no.

28:40.821 --> 28:42.821
It's just a stain.
We don't need to bail.

28:42.857 --> 28:44.221
- (trumpeting alert on phone)
- We can still...

28:44.257 --> 28:47.625
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

28:47.661 --> 28:49.760
Uh, is that Wizardville?

28:49.796 --> 28:52.296
Yeah. I love that game.
Do you play?

28:52.332 --> 28:56.334
Uh, fun fact...
I'm not just a user.

28:56.370 --> 28:59.637
- Can I tell you a secret? It's a little naughty.
- Okay.

28:59.673 --> 29:01.506
I side-loaded it
from a pirate site,

29:01.542 --> 29:03.508
got all the premium
content for free.

29:03.544 --> 29:05.242
I know.
I'm horrible.

29:05.278 --> 29:07.511
Yeah, you're horrible.

29:07.547 --> 29:10.949
Hundreds of people make their
living off of that content.

29:10.985 --> 29:12.651
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

29:12.687 --> 29:15.819
Let's... Um,
let's start from scratch.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.524
Let's just reboot the date
and something simple.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.793
- Shall we go for a drink?
- Yes. Let's go for a drink.

29:21.829 --> 29:24.698
- I don't drink.
- Then why would you say that?

29:29.370 --> 29:32.237
(explosion)

29:32.273 --> 29:34.206
(gunfire)

29:34.242 --> 29:35.340
He's trying to kill us!

29:35.376 --> 29:36.811
Yeah. Good observational
skills, Jack!

29:39.447 --> 29:41.716
Okay. He's reloading.
Let's move!

29:43.950 --> 29:44.751
(gunfire)

29:48.723 --> 29:51.590
- How many rounds do you have?
- Uh...

29:51.626 --> 29:53.357
You didn't bring
your service weapon?

29:53.393 --> 29:54.558
Who brings a gun
on a date?

29:54.594 --> 29:56.827
FBI agents, Jack,
which we are!

29:56.863 --> 29:58.430
(door banging)

29:58.466 --> 30:01.999
- Here! Help me with this!
- What? What? What are you doing?

30:02.035 --> 30:03.205
(grunts)

30:05.872 --> 30:06.604
(air hissing)

30:06.640 --> 30:07.905
You're filling the room
with gas!

30:07.941 --> 30:09.473
That's what
I'm trying to go.

30:09.509 --> 30:10.608
I need something
very small

30:10.644 --> 30:11.710
and battery-powered

30:11.746 --> 30:13.979
to act as a detonator.

30:14.015 --> 30:15.614
Vape pen.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.218
You vape?

30:19.786 --> 30:23.421
(siren)

30:23.457 --> 30:25.422
(Patterson's voicemail)
<i>Hey, you've reached Patterson.</i>

30:25.458 --> 30:27.595
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

30:34.034 --> 30:36.237
(explosion)

30:38.505 --> 30:39.673
Patterson.

30:48.783 --> 30:50.047
You got a signal?

30:50.083 --> 30:51.285
No.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.688
(gunshots)

30:55.656 --> 30:58.523
Zapata.
He was trying to kill me.

30:58.559 --> 31:00.659
I know. Reade and I
were just attacked, too.

31:00.695 --> 31:02.797
- Jane and Weller?
- I can't get ahold of 'em.

31:08.292 --> 31:10.086
(Reade) Okay. Let's go
home, get some rest,

31:10.122 --> 31:11.865
and regroup in the morning with
some fresh eyes, all right?

31:14.901 --> 31:16.968
(Weller)
So, here's how I see it.

31:17.004 --> 31:19.604
We either pursue that woman
that might be casing us

31:19.640 --> 31:23.574
or we finish
this lovely meal.

31:23.610 --> 31:24.745
Check, please.

31:27.613 --> 31:28.980
Okay. So, I'll tail her
out the back.

31:29.016 --> 31:31.449
Okay. I'll head out the front,
double back and cut her off.

31:31.485 --> 31:32.753
All right.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.924
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me, sir.

31:52.639 --> 31:56.039
(line ringing)

31:56.075 --> 31:57.344
- Hey!
- (gunshot)

32:00.346 --> 32:02.916
(both grunting)

32:10.090 --> 32:11.626
(phone vibrating)

32:26.038 --> 32:27.974
(assassin)
Oh, God!

32:31.077 --> 32:32.379
Jane!

32:35.114 --> 32:36.379
Jane!

32:36.415 --> 32:38.548
(phone ringing)

32:38.584 --> 32:40.651
Reade, someone's after us.

32:40.687 --> 32:41.818
Jane and I
were just attacked.

32:41.854 --> 32:43.824
(Reade)
<i>It's not just you and Jane.</i>

32:45.959 --> 32:48.326
(Roman) <i>It was good
seeing you in Croatia.</i>

32:48.362 --> 32:49.660
Where is Kurt?

32:49.696 --> 32:51.394
Well, let's see. Uh...

32:51.430 --> 32:52.730
the assassin
I hired to kill him

32:52.766 --> 32:54.798
has a thing for poison.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.800
Or was Zapata's
the poison guy?

32:56.836 --> 32:59.804
So many assassins,
it's really hard to keep track.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.539
- You were helping us.
- Plans change.

33:02.575 --> 33:05.843
<i>Why? Because the boss's
daughter made eyes at you?</i>

33:05.879 --> 33:08.679
Is that really all it takes
to get you to abandon

33:08.715 --> 33:10.414
your last shred of goodness?

33:10.450 --> 33:11.682
<i>You know, as it turns out,</i>

33:11.718 --> 33:13.616
<i>I'm in the market
for a new family.</i>

33:13.652 --> 33:14.751
(Jane)
Remi's dead.

33:14.787 --> 33:15.853
I got the chance
to start over,

33:15.889 --> 33:18.622
and I chose this life,
away from you.

33:18.658 --> 33:21.625
Roman, you don't
have to kill them.

33:21.661 --> 33:23.461
<i>Actually, I do.</i>

33:23.497 --> 33:25.429
Then why am I still alive?

33:25.465 --> 33:27.334
Why not kill me, too?

33:29.603 --> 33:31.702
Because that would be
too easy.

33:31.738 --> 33:33.570
You don't get to die
until you witness

33:33.606 --> 33:37.441
everyone you love
die first.

33:37.477 --> 33:39.577
(Patterson) The assassins
are a disparate band

33:39.613 --> 33:42.145
of mercenaries/hitmen who,
as far as we can tell,

33:42.181 --> 33:44.882
haven't worked together
prior to this job.

33:44.918 --> 33:46.116
Which will make it
that much harder

33:46.152 --> 33:47.184
to figure out who has Jane.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.853
What about the woman
who was sitting at the bar?

33:48.889 --> 33:50.587
Mr. Velvet
only had one camera

33:50.623 --> 33:51.789
facing the bar,
and she never

33:51.825 --> 33:53.590
looked towards it,
paid in cash.

33:53.626 --> 33:54.858
She knew
what she was doing.

33:54.894 --> 33:58.462
Wait! Freeze that.
Zoom in.

33:58.498 --> 33:59.997
Take a look at this guy

34:00.033 --> 34:03.134
taking a food selfie
at the bar.

34:03.170 --> 34:04.035
What about him?

34:04.071 --> 34:06.770
Are you hacking
their reservation system?

34:06.806 --> 34:08.638
Okay. Sitting
at barstool five

34:08.674 --> 34:10.107
at that exact moment,
Mr. Ira Siegel.

34:10.143 --> 34:13.409
Let's see if Ira Siegel
has an Instagram account.

34:13.446 --> 34:17.013
And... aha! Wow!

34:17.049 --> 34:18.649
Even I'm impressed
with me.

34:18.685 --> 34:20.885
Very attracted to
myself right now.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.389
Running face detection.

34:27.726 --> 34:29.458
That is a lot of aliases.

34:29.495 --> 34:32.897
Yeah. Let's see if any of
them rented a white truck.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.899
An eyewitness saw one
leave the scene.

34:34.935 --> 34:37.438
We find that truck,
we find Jane.

34:39.806 --> 34:41.871
You're not keeping me
alive to make me suffer.

34:41.908 --> 34:44.940
You're keeping me alive because you
can't bring yourself to kill me.

34:44.976 --> 34:46.708
You don't know
what I can't do.

34:46.745 --> 34:48.446
<i>Actually, I do.</i>

34:48.482 --> 34:50.647
Because I was the same.

34:50.683 --> 34:52.649
I couldn't kill you
either.

34:52.685 --> 34:53.817
<i>Was.</i>

34:53.853 --> 34:56.953
You'd better hope
we never meet again.

34:56.989 --> 35:01.191
Well, then, I guess it's
a good thing you're there

35:01.227 --> 35:02.792
and I'm here.

35:02.828 --> 35:05.562
Yeah. About that.

35:05.598 --> 35:07.964
You really should have
done this yourself.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.533
<i>Oh, yeah? Why is that?</i>

35:09.569 --> 35:11.234
'Cause you wouldn't
have wired this monitor

35:11.270 --> 35:14.475
through the truck's
main electrical system.

35:26.620 --> 35:27.822
(grunts)

35:33.926 --> 35:35.825
A replacement vehicle's
on the way.

35:35.861 --> 35:37.964
We should prep the cargo
for transfer.

35:41.734 --> 35:43.736
(both grunting)

36:09.629 --> 36:10.764
(gunshots)

36:18.686 --> 36:21.772
(panting)

36:21.808 --> 36:23.573
Kurt, is Avery okay?

36:23.609 --> 36:25.743
She's fine. I spoke
to her handlers.

36:25.779 --> 36:27.068
No one's made
a move on her.

36:27.104 --> 36:28.412
Only our team was targeted.

36:28.448 --> 36:30.113
We clearly struck a nerve
with Crawford.

36:30.149 --> 36:32.649
Which means, until we take
down Crawford and Roman,

36:32.685 --> 36:34.651
we've got to be
very careful.

36:34.687 --> 36:38.425
All of us have got
a bull's-eye on our back now.

36:43.797 --> 36:45.062
Alexis.

36:45.098 --> 36:46.600
Hey.

36:48.301 --> 36:50.067
Hey.

36:50.103 --> 36:53.403
Oh, uh,
you forgot this.

36:53.439 --> 36:55.308
You still don't
recognize her?

36:56.509 --> 36:58.542
I guess I see
a resemblance.

36:58.578 --> 37:00.410
Uh, so before
we got shot at,

37:00.446 --> 37:01.845
you were gonna give me
some rookie advice.

37:01.881 --> 37:04.549
Something about joining
for the right reasons.

37:04.585 --> 37:07.285
Look, you were right about
me putting on the uniform

37:07.321 --> 37:09.187
to escape,

37:09.223 --> 37:11.789
but it didn't work.

37:11.825 --> 37:13.290
I was still there.

37:13.326 --> 37:15.827
Is that why you left
the NYPD for the FBI?

37:15.863 --> 37:18.428
For starters.
If you can't go back,

37:18.464 --> 37:19.763
you gotta keep
moving forward.

37:19.799 --> 37:23.738
That was a really nice speech
you gave about Ricky.

37:25.172 --> 37:26.437
But you got one thing wrong.

37:26.473 --> 37:27.705
He kept pushing us away,

37:27.741 --> 37:31.575
but you,
you always came back.

37:31.611 --> 37:34.377
Every time he got out
of jail or rehab,

37:34.413 --> 37:35.712
you were there,

37:35.748 --> 37:38.448
even when
no one else was.

37:38.484 --> 37:41.185
You didn't give up
on him, Tash.

37:41.221 --> 37:43.520
He gave up on himself.

37:43.556 --> 37:47.627
'Cause real friends,
they always come back.

37:56.937 --> 38:00.337
(exhales)

38:00.373 --> 38:01.772
So, Millicent.

38:01.808 --> 38:03.774
We should probably
talk about that, right?

38:03.810 --> 38:07.178
There's nothing
to talk about.

38:07.214 --> 38:08.379
We had our differences,

38:08.415 --> 38:11.749
but she did not deserve
what she got.

38:11.785 --> 38:14.618
So, this would be
a bad time to point out

38:14.654 --> 38:16.620
that her untimely death
completely absolves you

38:16.656 --> 38:17.821
of any wrongdoing, right?

38:17.857 --> 38:21.258
Correct. I'm not sure
it does, anyway.

38:21.294 --> 38:22.760
She'd already
written a letter.

38:22.796 --> 38:25.196
It's on her desk and it's
probably gonna end my career.

38:25.232 --> 38:26.763
- She told you that?
- Yep.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.665
And OPR is on their way
to her office

38:28.701 --> 38:30.334
to gather
her belongings now.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.636
Yeah. About that. You know
our little conversation

38:32.672 --> 38:34.638
from earlier about,
uh, snooping?

38:34.674 --> 38:35.872
Rich, I told you
not to snoop.

38:35.908 --> 38:37.408
I don't know
who told who what.

38:37.444 --> 38:38.508
You looked through
a dead woman's office?

38:38.544 --> 38:39.810
In my defense, I think

38:39.846 --> 38:41.412
she was still alive
when I went in there.

38:41.448 --> 38:43.381
I mean, the timeline's
a little murky, but, uh,

38:43.417 --> 38:44.381
there's no letter.

38:44.417 --> 38:48.785
What? Are you sure?

38:48.821 --> 38:51.421
I looked all over,
hypothetically.

38:51.457 --> 38:52.656
Maybe she was bluffing.

38:52.692 --> 38:55.930
Hey, maybe she liked you
after all.

39:01.368 --> 39:03.804
(door opens)

39:19.352 --> 39:22.819
(shredder grinding)

39:22.855 --> 39:25.823
'Cause on paper,
we're such a great match.

39:25.859 --> 39:27.959
Yeah. The equation
should balance.

39:27.995 --> 39:30.961
Like two elements that
should go together, but don't.

39:30.997 --> 39:32.696
Yeah, or my math thing.

39:32.732 --> 39:35.366
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

39:35.402 --> 39:36.566
No, don't be sorry.

39:36.602 --> 39:38.569
This is...

39:38.605 --> 39:40.504
This is actually
a good thing.

39:40.540 --> 39:43.274
In science, knowing
what doesn't work

39:43.310 --> 39:46.980
is just as important
as knowing what does.

39:50.817 --> 39:54.285
Oh! You need to pay
for Wizardville.

39:54.321 --> 39:57.225
Like, immediately.

40:05.364 --> 40:07.732
Thank you...

40:07.768 --> 40:10.801
for coming
to the cooking school.

40:10.837 --> 40:13.537
- If you hadn't...
- Oh, that's... You...

40:13.573 --> 40:15.542
saved my ass
plenty of times.

40:18.779 --> 40:21.312
So, you and Jack...

40:21.348 --> 40:23.747
Oh, yeah. Uh...

40:23.783 --> 40:27.952
No, that's definitely
not a good fit.

40:27.988 --> 40:32.756
Oh. Well, if you
ever want to talk...

40:32.792 --> 40:35.629
- (bell dings)
- Good night, Zapata.

40:41.801 --> 40:44.702
What did your brother
say in the truck

40:44.738 --> 40:46.836
other than he wants
to kill all of us?

40:46.872 --> 40:50.508
He said he found
a new family.

40:50.544 --> 40:51.776
Do you believe him?

40:51.812 --> 40:54.778
Who knows, with Roman?

40:54.814 --> 40:56.981
I did realize
one thing, though,

40:57.017 --> 41:00.551
when I thought
you might be dead.

41:00.587 --> 41:03.386
Roman's never getting away
from me ever again.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.921
Even if you had to kill him?

41:04.957 --> 41:07.827
Especially if
I have to kill him.

41:15.701 --> 41:17.667
Subcontractors.
Am I right?

41:17.703 --> 41:19.839
That's why I'm cutting out
the middlemen.

41:21.841 --> 41:23.674
- (pulls slide on gun)
- Whoa. Easy.

41:23.710 --> 41:24.841
Stand down, soldier.

41:24.877 --> 41:26.977
You are too close
to Crawford.

41:27.013 --> 41:28.044
If you get caught...

41:28.080 --> 41:29.814
The FBI team
is still out there.

41:29.850 --> 41:34.385
Yes, and they are feeling
the walls closing around them.

41:34.421 --> 41:37.587
Crawford wants to move
forward with his plans

41:37.623 --> 41:39.993
for the land
we just secured.

41:45.131 --> 41:48.466
Do you know the shot
heard around the world?

41:48.502 --> 41:52.136
It's kind of like that,
but bigger.

41:52.172 --> 41:54.108
Bolder.

41:56.109 --> 41:57.344
Bloodier.

42:00.614 --> 42:04.115
Ready to change the world,
Mr. Jakeman?
