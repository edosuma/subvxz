"What Have I Done" playing)

00:04.075 --> 00:05.576
YOU LIKED THE TILE

00:05.576 --> 00:07.778
AND THE MASTER BEDROOM
SUITE?

00:07.778 --> 00:11.042
AND YOU LIKE THE WAY THE FRENCH
DOORS OPEN OUT TO THE DECK?

00:11.042 --> 00:12.343
YES, I LOVE EVERYTHING
SO FAR.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.785
I ESPECIALLY LOVE THAT I
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

00:14.785 --> 00:16.287
MEOW.

00:16.287 --> 00:19.019
MEOW. THAT'S RIGHT, ZOLA.
THAT'S WHAT A CAT SAYS.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.191
HONESTLY,
WHEN THE HOUSE IS DONE,

00:20.191 --> 00:21.652
JUST BRING ME OUT
FOR THE BIG REVEAL.

00:21.652 --> 00:23.624
YOU WANT A BIG REVEAL?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.096
I WANT A BIG REVEAL.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.297
RAWR!

00:26.297 --> 00:30.131
GOOD, ZOLA. RAWR.
THAT'S WHAT A LION SAYS.

00:34.805 --> 00:36.167
THAT'S A LION.

00:40.411 --> 00:41.572
(Meredith) WE HAVE A PHRASE

00:41.572 --> 00:43.074

00:43.074 --> 00:45.045
"DON'T PET THE LION."
RAWR.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.347
IT MEANS,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.250
NO MATTER HOW NICE
A TUMOR LOOKS,

00:49.250 --> 00:50.751
HOW SMALL IT IS,

00:50.751 --> 00:54.085
HOW PERFECT ITS MARGINS
MAY BE...

00:55.686 --> 00:58.089
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

00:58.089 --> 01:00.191
♪♪♪

01:00.191 --> 01:01.832
AT SOME POINT,
WE HAVE TO TALK.

01:01.832 --> 01:03.334
IT'S STILL A TUMOR.

01:03.334 --> 01:04.735
IT'S STILL DANGEROUS

01:04.735 --> 01:06.667
AND IT CAN BITE.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.169
IT'LL BE WEIRD AT FIRST.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.401
BELIEVE ME,
YOU'LL FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

01:10.401 --> 01:13.244
BUT THE WORDS CAN GIVE YOU
CLOSURE AND STRENGTH.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.746
SO I WANT YOU EACH LATER

01:15.746 --> 01:18.809
TO FIND A PRIVATE MOMENT
AND JUST SAY THE WORDS ALOUD--

01:18.809 --> 01:20.581
I AM A WIDOW.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.852

GRETCHEN?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.485
(stammers)

01:24.485 --> 01:26.417
IT WAS JUST SO SUDDEN.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.319
JASON WAS FINE,
AND THEN ONE DAY,

01:28.319 --> 01:31.192
THEY SAID
HE HAD SOME BLOCKAGES,

01:31.192 --> 01:32.463
MINOR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE,

01:32.463 --> 01:35.166
AND THEN HE DIED, AND I--

01:35.166 --> 01:37.168
(laughing)

01:37.168 --> 01:39.200
(women murmuring indistinctly)

01:39.200 --> 01:41.202
I'M--I'M SORRY.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.374
BUT BLOCKAGES
WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE?

01:43.374 --> 01:45.436
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS?

01:45.436 --> 01:48.379
YOUR HUSBAND'S ARTERIES
WERE CLOGGED.

01:48.379 --> 01:50.511
I MEAN, HE PROBABLY WAS LUCKY
HE LASTED AS LONG AS HE DID,

01:50.511 --> 01:53.844
BECAUSE HIS HEART WAS WORKING
OVERTIME TO PUMP ENOUGH BLOOD

01:53.844 --> 01:55.646
TO HIS BRAIN, LET ALONE
THE REST OF HIS BODY,

01:55.646 --> 01:57.218
WHICH ATE AWAY
THE HEART MUSCLE

01:57.218 --> 02:00.291
TILL THE VENTRICULAR WALL
WAS PAPER THIN

02:00.291 --> 02:02.453
AND BARELY CONTRACTING.

02:02.453 --> 02:05.896
BECAUSE JUST TO BE CLEAR,
THERE IS NO SUCH THING

02:05.896 --> 02:08.259
AS MINOR
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

02:08.259 --> 02:10.731
A-A PATIENT WITH SYMPTOMS
THAT SEVERE?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.264

ARE EXPOSED.

06:56.787 --> 06:58.118

07:00.090 --> 07:01.852

AND THEN IT GOT AWAY

07:01.852 --> 07:03.423
AND IT PROBABLY TRIED
TO EAT OTHER PEOPLE

07:03.423 --> 07:04.995

07:10.531 --> 07:11.832
NOW BECAUSE SHE'S CRAZY

07:11.832 --> 07:14.465
DOESN'T MEAN SHE DOESN'T

THAT CRAZY LADY'S LIFE

07:17.468 --> 07:18.669

I TRY TO TALK TO HER,

07:32.022 --> 07:33.924
SO JUST LET HER KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM.

07:33.924 --> 07:35.225
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK.

07:35.225 --> 07:38.088
IF I COULD--IT--
IT WAS JUST SEX.

07:38.088 --> 07:39.630
JUST STOP.

07:39.630 --> 07:40.791
I WOULD LOVE TO STOP.

07:40.791 --> 07:41.962
I MEAN,
I DON'T RELISH DISCUSSING

07:41.962 --> 07:44.595
MY OWN PERSONAL FAILINGS
WITH YOU, BUT--

07:44.595 --> 07:47.467
WE'RE GOING TO PRETEND THIS
CONVERSATION NEVER HAPPENED.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.639
OKAY?
MEREDITH--

07:48.639 --> 07:50.571
NO. I MEAN IT.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.744
DAMN IT.
NOW I HAVE TO SCRUB AGAIN.

07:53.744 --> 07:55.075
(sighs deeply)

07:55.075 --> 08:04.114
(water running)

08:08.488 --> 08:09.660
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ARIZONA

08:09.660 --> 08:10.621
AND THAT NURSE COLLEEN?

08:10.621 --> 08:11.792
WERE THEY A THING
BEFORE SHE MET ME?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.493
ORTHO NURSE COLLEEN?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.625
YEAH. THERE WAS A GOOD-BYE HUG
THAT LINGERED TOO LONG.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.866
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT.

08:15.866 --> 08:17.868
I BEEN TRYING TO GET HER NAKED
FOR THREE YEARS.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.270
(scoffs) ANYWAY,
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING,

08:20.270 --> 08:21.772
AND I-I WORK WITH COLLEEN
EVERY DAY.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.805
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS
OTHER EXES HERE IN THE HOSPITAL?

08:24.805 --> 08:25.936
PROBABLY.
UGH.

08:25.936 --> 08:28.809
OH, QUIT IT. STOP THINKING
ABOUT THE HOT ORTHO NURSE.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.981
WAIT. YOU...
YOU THINK SHE'S HOT?

08:30.981 --> 08:32.512
(elevator bell dings)

08:32.512 --> 08:33.684
(inhales sharply)

08:33.684 --> 08:34.985
I-I COULD SEE IT
IN THOSE EYES.

08:34.985 --> 08:37.848
THOSE EYES SAID,
"YOU ARE MEAT."

08:37.848 --> 08:39.219
AND IN THAT MOMENT,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.021
I BELIEVED HIM.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.553
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

08:42.553 --> 08:44.895
THEN HE LUNGED,
AND I JUST REACTED.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.727
I SHOVED MY ARM
RIGHT INTO HIS MOUTH.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.729
WHO THE HELL WHO DOES THAT?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.561
WHO THE HELL FEEDS HIMSELF
TO A LION?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.132
I'M KINDA WONDERING
THE SAME THING. (chuckles)

08:54.304 --> 08:55.666
WHAT DO WE GOT?

08:55.666 --> 08:56.837
DEEP ANIMAL CLAW LACERATION
EXTENDING DOWN

08:56.837 --> 08:57.868
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY.

08:57.868 --> 08:59.169
AND THERE'S YOUR ARM.

08:59.169 --> 09:02.573
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT
WHEN YOU HEAR "LION."

09:02.573 --> 09:03.814
I BET IT'S NICE TO KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT

09:03.814 --> 09:05.646
INSTEAD OF SHOWING UP
AT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE

09:05.646 --> 09:07.317
FOR THE FIRST TIME

09:07.317 --> 09:09.319
AND BEING GREETED AT THE DOOR BY
THE FREAKIN' KING OF THE JUNGLE.

09:09.319 --> 09:11.752
SHE NEVER BOTHERED TO MENTION
SHE HAD A PET LION?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.754
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT OUGHT
TO COME UP ON A FIRST DATE.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.325
RIGHT?
SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD A CAT--

09:15.325 --> 09:17.828
A BIG CAT--AND I'M ALLERGIC,

09:17.828 --> 09:20.831
SO I TOOK AN ANTIHISTAMINE
BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.633
(inhales sharply)

09:22.633 --> 09:25.065
OH, YEAH. YOU SHOULDA
BROUGHT A BULL WHIP.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.937
(monitor beeps)

09:26.937 --> 09:29.940
SO I DISSECT OUT AND REMOVE
THE ANIMAL CADAVER HEARTS.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.942
THEN I INSERT THEM
WITH THE CATHETERS

09:31.942 --> 09:34.004
AND BEGIN INJECTING THEM
WITH THE SOLVENT.

09:34.004 --> 09:35.706
CORRECT.
AND WHY DO WE DO THAT?

09:35.706 --> 09:36.877
TO DRAIN THE HEARTS

09:36.877 --> 09:38.208
OF THEIR
EXISTING CARDIAC CELLS

09:38.208 --> 09:41.812
SO ALL THAT'S LEFT IS
THEIR EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.254
LIKE STRIPPING A HOUSE DOWN
TO ITS FRAME ONLY.

09:44.254 --> 09:47.758
WE ARE SCRUBBING AWAY
CELLS OF HEARTS, CRISTINA,

09:47.758 --> 09:49.089
ACTUAL HEARTS.
MM-HMM.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.721
WE ARE WIPING THEM CLEAN,

09:50.721 --> 09:53.293
TILL THEY'RE BLANK.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.795
AND THEN IN THEORY,

09:54.795 --> 09:56.997
WHEN WE INJECT THEM
WITH STEM CELLS...

09:56.997 --> 09:59.369
THEY'LL LIVE AGAIN.

09:59.369 --> 10:02.633
LET'S GROW OURSELVES
SOME NEW HEARTS.

10:02.633 --> 10:03.904
(door opens)

10:03.904 --> 10:05.706
DR. ALTMAN, I--
I TRADED WITH KEPNER.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.277
I'M ON YOUR SERVICE TODAY.

10:07.277 --> 10:08.378
ARE YOU UP ON MY PATIENTS?

10:08.378 --> 10:10.310
UH--
(smart phone chimes)

10:10.310 --> 10:12.643
KAREV?
KAREV, CAN YOU FOCUS?

10:12.643 --> 10:14.184
YEAH. SORRY.

10:14.184 --> 10:16.086
(smart phone chimes)

10:16.086 --> 10:18.819
OH, THAT'S THE E.R.
LET'S GO.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.951
HAPPY SCRUBBING.

10:25.355 --> 10:27.928
(door closes)

10:31.932 --> 10:33.734
(sighs)

10:33.734 --> 10:35.405
(beeping)

10:35.405 --> 10:39.139
YOU IMMOBILIZE THE ANEURYSM
AND PLACE THE CLIP.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.971
WAIT. I'M CLIPPING
THE ANEURYSM?

10:40.971 --> 10:42.913
WHAT IF IT RUPTURES?

10:42.913 --> 10:45.175
I-I CLIP PROXIMAL AND DISTAL
TO THE ANEURYSM.

10:45.175 --> 10:46.877
WHAT IF YOU DAMAGE
THE PERFORATING VESSELS?

10:46.877 --> 10:50.881
I THROW A TEMPORARY CLIP
ON THE PARENT ARTERY.

10:50.881 --> 10:53.083
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO DO IT.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.887
I-I KNOW THAT I-
I REALLY MESSED UP LAST WEEK.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.088
YES, YOU DID.

10:58.088 --> 10:59.790
BUT YOU'RE STILL A STUDENT,
AND THIS IS HOW YOU LEARN.

10:59.790 --> 11:00.961
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.663
(beeping continues)

11:03.663 --> 11:06.396
ARE YOU GONNA TELL MARK
TO MOVE IN WITH JULIA?

11:06.396 --> 11:08.699
I MEAN, WHAT DO THEY
EVEN REALLY TALK ABOUT?

11:08.699 --> 11:10.701
YOU KNOW, SHE SEWS EYEBALLS
FOR A LIVING. IT'S GROSS.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.703
I MEAN, PLUS, SHE HAS
REALLY THIN HAIR,

11:12.703 --> 11:14.805
WHICH CAN BE A-A SIGN
OF EARLY MENOPAUSE.

11:14.805 --> 11:15.906
(beeping continues)

11:15.906 --> 11:17.708
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
STUFF LIKE THIS.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.909
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
STUFF LIKE THIS.

11:18.909 --> 11:21.782
I WILL SEE YOU IN PRE-OP.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.784
(door closes)

11:23.784 --> 11:25.185
(monitor beeping erratically)
YOU'RE NOT USING THE OIL.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.887
ALEX USES HIS OIL
WHEN TOMMY'S DISTRESSED.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.018
IT KEEPS HIM
FROM DESATURATING.

11:28.018 --> 11:29.319
HIS SATS ARE REALLY LOW.
I DON'T THINK THE OIL IS--

11:29.319 --> 11:31.121
JUST USE THE OIL.
CAN WE PAGE DR. ROBBINS?

11:31.121 --> 11:33.123
NO, PAGE DR. KAREV.
ALEX--

11:33.123 --> 11:34.925
PAGE ROBBINS NOW!

11:34.925 --> 11:36.326
(woman speaks indistinctly)

11:36.326 --> 11:37.728
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PAIN?

11:37.728 --> 11:38.869
I DON'T KNOW.
UH, IT JUST, UH...

11:38.869 --> 11:40.931
(smart phone chimes)
IT'S LIKE A...

11:40.931 --> 11:44.104
IT--IT'S CRUSHING ME

11:44.104 --> 11:45.876
AND I CAN'T SHAKE IT.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.007
HAND ME THE E.K.G.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.239
UH, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANTEROLATERAL M.I.

11:49.239 --> 11:51.381
WE ALMOST DIDN'T COME IN.

11:51.381 --> 11:53.043
WE'RE ONLY IN TOWN
TILL TOMORROW.

11:53.043 --> 11:55.846
WE'RE CATCHING A CRUISE
FOR ALASKA.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.147
(chimes)

11:57.147 --> 11:59.750
MR. CARROLL, YOU'RE
EXPERIENCING A HEART ATTACK.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.752
WE NEED TO TAKE YOU
UP TO THE CATH LAB

12:01.752 --> 12:03.053
FOR AN ANGIOPLASTY.

12:03.053 --> 12:04.394
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

12:04.394 --> 12:05.926
WHEN YOU FELT THE CHEST PAIN?

12:05.926 --> 12:09.760
WE JUST WENT OUT TO WALK AROUND
OUR BED AND BREAKFAST.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.302
AND, UH, IT WAS LIKE
A PIANO FELL

12:12.302 --> 12:13.804
ONTO MY CHEST.

12:13.804 --> 12:15.235
SO YOU WERE WALKING.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.867
YOU WEREN'T RUNNING
OR ANYTHING ELSE

12:16.867 --> 12:18.738
THAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED
THE PAIN?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.910
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:19.910 --> 12:21.912
WELL...

12:21.912 --> 12:24.945
(laughs)

12:24.945 --> 12:26.416
WE SAW A LION.

12:26.416 --> 12:27.978
(laughs)

12:27.978 --> 12:29.319
(laughs) YEAH.

12:29.319 --> 12:30.851
(groans)

12:30.851 --> 12:32.022
HEY.

12:32.022 --> 12:33.483
SO THAT WAS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

12:33.483 --> 12:35.055
DON'T YOU THINK,
THAT THING WITH COLLEEN?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.028
HOW SHE WAS--
SHE GOT SO EMOTIONAL.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.990
ALMOST SEEMS LIKE
YOU GUYS WERE A THING.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.461
YEAH, SHE GETS LIKE THAT.
OH, REALLY?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.833
SHE GETS LIKE THAT,
LIKE YOU KNOW HOW SHE GETS,

12:42.833 --> 12:43.994
LIKE YOU WERE A THING?
CALLIE.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.165
WHAT? IT'S NOT--
WHAT? I'M JUST ASKING.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.496
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.768
OH, WE WERE. WE WERE A L--
A LITTLE BIT OF A THING

12:48.768 --> 12:49.900
A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.241
OH. WOW. WOW.

12:51.241 --> 12:52.772
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING
YOU WOULD'VE MENTIONED.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.904
WELL, IT DIDN'T EVEN
OCCUR TO ME.

12:53.904 --> 12:55.345
OH. HAVE YOU DATED
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL

12:55.345 --> 12:57.007
IT HASN'T OCCURRED TO YOU
TO TELL ME ABOUT?

12:57.007 --> 12:58.048
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:58.048 --> 12:59.209
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

12:59.209 --> 13:00.380
NO, IT'S TOTALLY FINE.
(chuckles)

13:00.380 --> 13:01.781
I MEAN, I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT MY EXES.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.353
(sighs) I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR EXES.

13:03.353 --> 13:04.484
NOT ALL OF THEM.
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT KAREV.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.256
KAREV.
I KNOW ABOUT KAREV.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.188
LOOK, JUST GIVE ME A NUMBER.
BALLPARK.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.359
(smart phone chimes)

13:09.359 --> 13:11.061
WHAT, FIVE? TEN?
A HUNDRED?

13:11.061 --> 13:12.562
OKAY, THAT'S THE NICU.
I HAVE TO GO.

13:12.562 --> 13:14.094
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T JUST GO.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.265
I'M SORRY, BUT THE BABIES,
THEY NEED ME, SO...

13:15.265 --> 13:16.526
ARIZONA--

13:16.526 --> 13:17.898
OH, I'M SORRY. WAIT.
WAIT. WH-- (imitates crying)

13:17.898 --> 13:19.069
"DR. ROBBINS,
PLEASE HELP US."

13:19.069 --> 13:20.871
JUST--JUST GIVE ME A NUMBER.
(imitates crying)

13:20.871 --> 13:22.502
JUST GIVE ME A NUMBER.
JUST GIVE ME A NUMBER.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.134
ONE OR TWO, OKAY?

13:24.134 --> 13:25.976
THAT'S--THAT'S IT.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.938
ONE OR TWO.

13:27.938 --> 13:31.111
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.943
MAYBE SHE SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN A DOG.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.045
A DOG FETCHES BALLS.

13:35.045 --> 13:37.047
MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
A RASCALLY DOG,

13:37.047 --> 13:38.218
HE CHEWS SHOES.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.090
BUT HE DOESN'T EVISCERATE
YOUR SPLEEN.

13:40.090 --> 13:44.094
YEAH, AND DON'T SAY IT'S
BECAUSE YOU LOVE LIONS SO MUCH.

13:44.094 --> 13:45.225
IF YOU LOVE LIONS,

13:45.225 --> 13:47.527
YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT
TO LIVE IN YOUR HOME.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.060
YOU WOULD WANT THAT LION
TO ROAM FREELY

13:50.060 --> 13:52.402
IN THE JUNGLE
WITH OTHER LIONS

13:52.402 --> 13:55.265
WHERE THEY CAN EVISCERATE
THE SPLEENS OF...

13:55.265 --> 13:56.436
GAZELLES.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.168
THAT'S WHAT LIONS EAT,
GAZELLES?

13:58.168 --> 14:00.140
I THINK I SAW THAT
ON A SHOW

14:00.140 --> 14:02.172
WHERE THEY WERE CHASING
A HERD OF GAZELLES.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.174
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
suction gurgling)

14:04.174 --> 14:07.247
HAVE I OFFENDED SOMEONE? 'CAUSE
IT'S AWFULLY QUIET IN HERE.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.019
(bovie sizzling)

14:09.019 --> 14:11.281
WELL, DON'T TELL ME
YOU OWN

14:11.281 --> 14:14.054
AN EXOTIC PET
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.285
GREY,
YOU LIVING WITH A MONKEY?

14:15.285 --> 14:17.057
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE LIVING WITH A MONKEY.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.128
NO. NO MONKEYS.

14:18.128 --> 14:19.289
UH, HUNT?

14:19.289 --> 14:22.032
UH, NO. CRISTINA
DOESN'T BELIEVE IN PETS.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.064
CRISTINA DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN A LOT OF THINGS.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.396
(beeping and sizzling continue)

14:26.396 --> 14:27.998
(sighs)

14:29.869 --> 14:32.002
OKAY, THEN.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.044
SUCTION.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.876
(suction gurgles)

14:42.152 --> 14:43.383
I'M SORRY.
EXPLAIN IT AGAIN.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.554
UH, DURING THE ANGIOPLASTY,

14:44.554 --> 14:46.456
MR. CARROLL HAD
ANOTHER HEART ATTACK.

14:46.456 --> 14:49.159
WE PLACED A BALLOON PUMP
TO STABILIZE HIM,

14:49.159 --> 14:51.021
BUT THAT ONLY BUYS US
A LITTLE TIME.

14:51.021 --> 14:53.163
THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO SURGERY, EMMA.

14:53.163 --> 14:56.066
BUT HE--HE'S GOING
TO BE OKAY?

14:56.066 --> 14:58.999
IF WE CAN PERFORM
A CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SOON,

14:58.999 --> 15:01.231
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'VE
CAUGHT IT IN TIME.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.103
I AM SO SORRY, EM.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.205
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS TRIP 50 YEARS.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.376
(sighs)

15:06.376 --> 15:09.639
THIS CRUISE WAS A... GIFT

15:09.639 --> 15:12.012
FROM OUR KIDS
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.184
AND NOW
I'VE MESSED IT ALL UP.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.146
YOU DIDN'T
MESS ANYTHING UP.

15:16.146 --> 15:19.249
YOU WANTED TO SEE
THOSE HUMPBACK WHALES SO BAD.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.091
FORGET THE WHALES.

15:21.091 --> 15:23.293
WE CAME FACE-TO-FACE
WITH A LION.

15:23.293 --> 15:25.395
YES, WE DID. (chuckles)

15:25.395 --> 15:28.228
IT'S ALREADY
A HECK OF A VACATION.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.361
YES, IT IS.

15:31.361 --> 15:33.363
(people speaking indistinctly)

15:33.363 --> 15:36.306
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
MARTIN.

15:36.306 --> 15:39.639
SAY THAT TO ME TOMORROW.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.012

15:46.446 --> 15:48.248
MAKE SURE HIS LABS
ARE UP TO DATE,

15:48.248 --> 15:50.950

UP TO PRE-OP.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.283

speaking indistinctly)

15:53.283 --> 15:55.255

THIS STUFF.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.192
OKAY? BUT I-I KINDA NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF,

BECAUSE WHAT IF I DON'T
AND THEN I MISS AN OPPORTUNITY

16:04.264 --> 16:06.166
TO APPEAL TO MY BIG BROTHER
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT--

16:06.166 --> 16:08.038
WHAT IF MARK IS MY SOUL MATE?

16:08.038 --> 16:09.369
I AM NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND
RIGHT NOW, LEXIE.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.341
I AM NOT YOUR BIG BROTHER.
I AM YOUR ATTENDING.

IS MY RESIDENT.

speaking indistinctly)

16:15.545 --> 16:17.277
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.350
I'M SORRY. I...

16:20.350 --> 16:21.611

16:21.611 --> 16:24.354
GOOD. MAKE SURE
OUR PATIENT IS PREPPED.

ABOUT A LION LADY?

17:12.162 --> 17:13.363
YEAH. HER BOYFRIEND WAS
THE APPETIZER,

17:13.363 --> 17:14.804

THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO?

18:56.206 --> 18:58.538
I THINK THAT YOU NEED

18:58.538 --> 19:01.571
WHAT KIND OF LIFE
YOU WANT FOR YOUR SON.

19:01.571 --> 19:04.274
IS IT OKAY FOR HIM
TO BE IN PAIN EVERY DAY?

19:04.274 --> 19:07.217
IS IT OKAY IF HE NEEDS
A FEEDING TUBE

19:07.217 --> 19:08.548

DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
WE'RE NOT IN THIS.

20:32.662 --> 20:34.764

23:46.926 --> 23:48.027
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.699
IT MEANS SHE'S PLANNING
TO FORGIVE YOU

23:49.699 --> 23:52.031
OR SHE'S DESPERATELY TRYING
TO FIND A WAY TO FORGIVE YOU.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.003
(door hisses open)
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT WAS JUST SEX.

23:54.003 --> 23:56.065
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO KNOW,
OKAY?

23:56.065 --> 23:59.469
AND NOW I DO, SO DON'T.

25:35.605 --> 25:36.936
THANK YOU.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.237
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
SHE'S TWEAKING ABOUT COLLEEN

25:38.237 --> 25:39.609
AND ALL THE OTHERS.

25:39.609 --> 25:40.940
EXCUSE ME?

25:40.940 --> 25:43.012
I TRIED TO TALK HER DOWN,
BUT IT COULD GET UGLY--

25:43.012 --> 25:44.143
MAULED BY A LION UGLY.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.616
(laughs)

25:46.616 --> 25:50.119
YOU TALKED TO YOUR EX
ABOUT MY EXES?

25:50.119 --> 25:51.881
YEAH. I WANTED SOME INPUT.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.552
NO. NO, NO, NO. HE DOES NOT
GET TO HAVE THAT INPUT

25:53.552 --> 25:54.924
ON OUR LOVE LIFE.

25:54.924 --> 25:56.085
OKAY, EXCUSE ME.

25:56.085 --> 25:57.587
COLLEEN WAS AN ORTHO NURSE.

25:57.587 --> 25:59.058
I WORKED WITH HER EVERY DAY
FOR TWO YEARS,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.060
AND I HAD NO IDEA
THAT THE TWO OF YOU...

26:01.060 --> 26:03.162
(sighs)
SHE'S SEEN YOU NAKED.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.934
OKAY, FINE.

26:04.934 --> 26:06.265
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.967
I WANT NAMES.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.769
(chuckles) MM.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.940
HER.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.142
(indistinct conversations
continue)

26:13.142 --> 26:14.844
AND HER.

26:14.844 --> 26:16.906
MM.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.148
MM. AND HER,
OVER BY THE SODA MACHINE.

26:19.148 --> 26:20.750
YEAH, TWICE.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.051
(chuckles) OKAY, THAT'S NOELLE.
SHE'S NOT EVEN GAY.

26:22.051 --> 26:24.654
WELL, SHE WAS THAT NIGHT.
(chuckles)

26:24.654 --> 26:27.917
UH, ALSO NANCY IN PATH,
UH, MEG IN DERMO,

26:27.917 --> 26:29.659
NURSE TIA
AND HER SISTER,

26:29.659 --> 26:32.622
BUT, YOU KNOW,
NOT AT THE SAME TIME.

26:32.622 --> 26:34.924
(crunches)

26:34.924 --> 26:37.366
CAN I GET SOMETHING
FOR THE PAIN?

26:37.366 --> 26:40.029
UH, YOU ARE MAXED OUT
ON PAIN MEDS, BUDDY.

26:40.029 --> 26:42.331
OF COURSE I AM.

26:42.331 --> 26:44.934
I SWEAR TO GOD, PAUL,
YOU'RE SUCH A WUSSY.

26:44.934 --> 26:46.676
OH, NO ONE THINKS THAT.
THEY SHOULD.

26:46.676 --> 26:49.178
NAOMI DOES.

26:49.178 --> 26:51.941
GOTTA BE WHY SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT KIRBY WAS A LION.

26:51.941 --> 26:53.242
SHE KNEW I WOULD'VE
FREAKED OUT.

26:53.242 --> 26:55.214
WE MET ON A DATING SITE.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.047
AND WHEN I SAW HER PROFILE,
SHE SEEMED...

26:58.047 --> 26:59.348
SO ADVENTUROUS,

26:59.348 --> 27:00.850
OUTDOORSY.

27:00.850 --> 27:03.853
MAYBE I MISREPRESENTED MYSELF
A LITTLE BIT.

27:03.853 --> 27:06.155
PRETENDED I WAS
ADVENTUROUS AND OUTDOORSY.

27:06.155 --> 27:07.857
WHEN WE MET, I COULD TELL

27:07.857 --> 27:09.859
SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.202
BUT SHE STUCK AROUND,

27:13.202 --> 27:17.066
TRYING TO SEE IF THE...

27:17.066 --> 27:19.238
GUY I PRETENDED TO BE
WAS IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.871
BUT WHEN I SHOVED MY ARM

27:21.871 --> 27:23.172
INTO KIRBY'S MOUTH

27:23.172 --> 27:25.244
AND I FELT HIM CHOMP DOWN,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.646
I SCREAMED.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.119
(voice breaking)
I REALLY, REALLY SCREAMED.

27:30.119 --> 27:33.422
SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH.

27:33.422 --> 27:37.356
(normal voice)
I AM A... WUSSY.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.728
HANG ON.

27:38.728 --> 27:40.790
KIRBY WAS GOING FOR HER

27:40.790 --> 27:42.191
AND NOT YOU,

27:42.191 --> 27:44.894
AND YOU BODY BLOCKED
A LION?

27:44.894 --> 27:46.295
MM-HMM.

27:48.097 --> 27:49.969
SON, YOU ARE A HERO.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.372
YOU WERE THE KNIGHT
ON THE WHITE HORSE

27:53.372 --> 27:56.045
WHO STARED INTO
THE DRAGON'S JAWS

27:56.045 --> 27:57.346
AND SHOVED HIS FIST

27:57.346 --> 28:01.180
STRAIGHT DOWN
THE BASTARD'S THROAT.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.183
SO... I SAVED HER?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.154
(laughs)

28:05.154 --> 28:06.916
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING,

28:06.916 --> 28:10.059
THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD'VE
BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU DID.

28:10.059 --> 28:11.120
REALLY?

28:14.063 --> 28:17.026
OH, YEAH. ME--
I MEAN, ME EITHER.

28:17.026 --> 28:19.328
HUH.

28:19.328 --> 28:20.970
YOU WANT TO COME TALK
TO THE WIFE?

28:20.970 --> 28:22.972
YOU JUST WANT AN AUDIENCE
WHILE YOU DO YOUR VICTORY LAP.

28:22.972 --> 28:25.234
YOU BET I DO.

28:25.234 --> 28:29.208
(indistinct conversations)

28:29.208 --> 28:33.082
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

28:33.082 --> 28:34.784
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A-A LITTLE INTERESTED

28:34.784 --> 28:36.245
IN WHY I KNOW ABOUT A.N.D.?

28:36.245 --> 28:38.918
IT'S 'CAUSE I HAVE TO DECIDE
TODAY IF

28:38.918 --> 28:40.990
I MAKE ROBBINS OPERATE
ON TOMMY'S FISTULA

28:40.990 --> 28:42.892
OR I JUST LET HIM DIE.

28:42.892 --> 28:44.223
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THERE ALREADY.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.025
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU VAPORIZED.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.297
I'M SORRY.
I-I-I WAS IN SURGERY.

28:48.297 --> 28:52.261
HE... HE HAD
SUCH A GOOD DAY YESTERDAY.

28:52.261 --> 28:53.933
I ACTUALLY WENT ONLINE
LAST NIGHT

28:53.933 --> 28:55.264
AND FOUND A USED CRIB,

28:55.264 --> 28:58.167
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
IT'S LIKE...

28:58.167 --> 29:01.270
WHY CAN'T HE JUST HAVE
A FEW GOOD DAYS IN A ROW?

29:01.270 --> 29:04.844
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT--WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

29:04.844 --> 29:07.176
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO--

29:07.176 --> 29:10.749
TO CONSIDER THE QUALITY OF LIFE
THAT YOU WANT TO OFFER TOMMY--

29:10.749 --> 29:13.322
I DON'T NEED YOU TO GIVE ME
THE FRIGGIN' PARTY LINE, ALEX.

29:13.322 --> 29:14.854
I HAVE ROBBINS FOR THAT.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.185
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

29:16.185 --> 29:17.887
IT'S NOT MY DECISION.

29:17.887 --> 29:19.758
HEY. HEY.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.990
DON'T GET ALL OBJECTIVE
ON ME NOW.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.461
IT'S NOT THE TIME.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.163
NO, IT IS THE TIME.

29:24.163 --> 29:27.366
LOOK, I'M NOT HIS DAD,
I'M--I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND,

29:27.366 --> 29:29.939
AND YOU CAN'T RELY ON ME
TO HELP YOU MAKE THIS DECISION.

29:29.939 --> 29:32.441
WOW. REALLY? NOW?

29:32.441 --> 29:34.143
IN--IN THE WORST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE,

29:34.143 --> 29:36.075
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
I UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT A COUPLE?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.206
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:37.206 --> 29:39.508
THIS ISN'T THE WORST MOMENT
OF YOUR LIFE.

29:39.508 --> 29:42.281
THE WORST MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
IS GONNA BE WHEN TOMMY DIES,

29:42.281 --> 29:44.353
OR WHEN HE DOESN'T DIE
AND HE'S IN PAIN AND FRUSTRATED

29:44.353 --> 29:46.856
BECAUSE HIS BODY WON'T DO
WHAT HE WANTS IT TO DO,

29:46.856 --> 29:48.357
OR HIS BRAIN DOESN'T WORK LIKE
THE OTHER KIDS' BRAINS WORK,

29:48.357 --> 29:49.318
AND YOU'RE SPENDING
HALF YOUR LIFE

29:49.318 --> 29:50.489
GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.261
SO WHAT IF HE'S NOT PERFECT?

29:52.261 --> 29:54.163
WHY DO YOU ALL PEOPLE THINK
THAT JUST BECAUSE HE'S BLIND...

29:54.163 --> 29:56.225
(voice breaking) OR IMPAIRED
OR--OR NOT A FREAKIN' DOCTOR,

29:56.225 --> 29:58.227
HE'S NOT WORTH SOMETHING?

29:58.227 --> 30:00.299
THE POINT IS, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE REST OF US THINK.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.400
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.372
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS WHAT YOU THINK.

30:03.372 --> 30:04.573
SO DECIDE--

30:04.573 --> 30:05.935
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO DO.

30:05.935 --> 30:07.176
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
