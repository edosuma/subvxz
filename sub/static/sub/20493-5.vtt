NEARLY 50 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS

02:15.900 --> 02:18.967

02:15.900 --> 02:18.967
EVEN IN A BAD ECONOMY, THE PET

02:18.967 --> 02:23.067
INDUSTRY IS RECESSION-PROOF.

02:18.967 --> 02:23.067

03:10.333 --> 03:13.067
THIS IS WHERE WE DO OUR

03:10.333 --> 03:13.067
GROOMING.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.333
I GO INTO THE DOG GROOMING

03:13.067 --> 03:15.333
ROOM, AND I NOTICE THAT THERE'S

03:15.333 --> 03:18.767
NO SIGNS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE

03:15.333 --> 03:18.767
BUILDING KIND OF DETAILING WHAT

03:18.767 --> 03:09.067
GOES ON INSIDE THIS FACILITY,

03:18.767 --> 03:09.067
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW A

03:09.067 --> 03:21.900
INTERESTING.

03:09.067 --> 03:21.900
CUSTOMER'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW WE

03:21.900 --> 03:23.567
DO.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.567
HERE'S ALYSSA.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.333
HOW ARE YOU?

03:23.567 --> 03:26.333

03:26.333 --> 03:27.233
YEAH.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.233
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.100
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW TO PRICE

03:27.233 --> 03:29.100
IT?

03:29.100 --> 03:31.200
WE PRICE BASED ON BREED.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.200
CONDITION OF THE COAT IS ALWAYS

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
A FACTOR....DEPENDING ON WHAT

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
THEY WANT US TO DO, IF THERE'S

03:34.200 --> 03:38.900
ANY SPECIAL, LIKE, REQUESTS...

03:34.200 --> 03:38.900
SO DO YOU KINDA MAKE IT UP?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.533
PRETTY MUCH.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.533
OKAY.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.433
THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE

03:41.533 --> 03:43.433
CENTERPIECE OF LA DOGWORKS.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.800
IT'S A 2,500-SQUARE FOOT INDOOR

03:43.433 --> 03:45.800
DOG PARK.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.967
THIS IS FOR DOGS TO PLAY.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.967
VERY COOL. AND WHO'S THAT?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.767
JESSE, WHO IS DIRECTOR OF

03:48.967 --> 03:50.767
ANIMAL CARE.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.667
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN WORKING

03:50.767 --> 03:52.667
HERE?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.833
SEVEN YEARS.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.833
HI, GUYS.

03:54.833 --> 03:58.700
HI, GEORGE.

03:54.833 --> 03:58.700
THIS IS MARCUS.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.467
TO GO IN AND SEE THE THOUGHT

03:58.700 --> 04:01.467
AND THE CREATIVITY THAT ANDREW

04:01.467 --> 04:04.167
PUT INTO THIS...

04:01.467 --> 04:04.167
IT'S VERY WELL-THOUGHT OUT.

04:04.167 --> 04:07.767
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

04:04.167 --> 04:07.767
HI, GUYS.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.900
WE CALL IT THE DOG DECK.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.900
IT'S A SAFE HAVEN.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.867
IF YOU NOTICE THE BUNK BEDS

04:10.900 --> 04:12.867
I CREATED--I INVENTED THESE.

04:12.867 --> 04:15.167
I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER DO

04:12.867 --> 04:15.167
THIS.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.867
YOU INVENTED THE BUNK BED?

04:15.167 --> 04:17.867
FOR DOGS--FOR USE WITH DOGS.

04:17.867 --> 04:20.567
[laughs] OKAY. OKAY.

04:17.867 --> 04:20.567
WHERE ARE THE SWEETS AT?

04:20.567 --> 04:22.667
YOU DON'T HAVE LITTLE SWEETS,

04:20.567 --> 04:22.667
INDIVIDUAL SWEETS--

04:22.667 --> 04:24.467
WE DON'T DO SWEETS.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.467
YOU DON'T.

04:24.467 --> 04:27.033
WHAT WE DO--IT'S A TWO-STORY

04:24.467 --> 04:27.033
PREFABRICATED KENNEL SYSTEM.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.100
HEY, BUDDY.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.100
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.667
YOU KNOW, THE CHAIN LINK, YOU

04:29.100 --> 04:31.667
KNOW, "MY DOG WAS IN A SHELTER

04:31.667 --> 04:33.767
AND IT'S GONNA BRING BACK BAD

04:31.667 --> 04:33.767
MEMORIES."

04:33.767 --> 04:35.733
FIRST OF ALL, DOGS DON'T THINK

04:33.767 --> 04:35.733
THAT WAY.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.767
IT WOULD NEVER--A DOG WOULD

04:35.733 --> 04:37.767
NEVER THINK THAT WAY.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.633
THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF

04:37.767 --> 04:39.633
WHEN I GOT MY TWO COCKER

04:39.633 --> 04:43.600
SPANIELS FROM A SHELTER...IT HAS

04:39.633 --> 04:43.600
THE SAME FEEL AS A SHELTER.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.300
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE SAY

04:43.600 --> 04:45.300
IT.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.633
WELL, PEOPLE.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.633
NOT DOGS.

04:47.633 --> 04:50.367
YOU BUILD THESE ROOMS THAT LOOK

04:47.633 --> 04:50.367
LIKE HUMAN ROOMS--YOU THINK THE

04:50.367 --> 04:52.800
DOGS CARE ABOUT THIS?

04:50.367 --> 04:52.800
BUT IT'S THE MARKETING FOR

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
THE CUSTOMER, NOT FOR THE DOG,

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
RIGHT?

04:54.800 --> 04:57.833
I MEAN, IT'S HOW I LEAVE THE DOG

04:54.800 --> 04:57.833
AND HOW I THINK ABOUT IT.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.167
OKAY. WE DO IT OUR WAY, AND

04:57.833 --> 05:01.167
IT WORKS REALLY WELL.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.600
THIS IS WHERE WE DO TRAINING.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.600
EMILY IS OUR DIRECTOR OF

05:03.600 --> 05:05.633
TRAINING.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.633
ARE YOU EMILY?

05:05.633 --> 05:07.333
I AM.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.333
HEY, I'M MARCUS, HOW ARE YOU?

05:07.333 --> 05:09.100
MARCUS, A PLEASURE.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.100
REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.833
AND ZOE.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.833
THIS IS ZOE.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.233
TRAINING IS A VERY, VERY

05:10.833 --> 05:13.233
IMPORTANT PART OF LA DOGWORKS

05:13.233 --> 05:16.167
WHICH FELL OFF GREATLY.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.167
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

05:16.167 --> 05:18.700
YOU KNOW WHAT, LA DOGWORKS

05:16.167 --> 05:18.700
ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.833
HOW DOES A CUSTOMER CONTACT

05:18.700 --> 05:21.833
YOU IF THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT?

05:21.833 --> 05:24.367
THERE'S A WEBSITE OUT THERE

05:21.833 --> 05:24.367
THAT PEOPLE POST BUSINESS

05:24.367 --> 05:27.567
REVIEWS, AND WE'VE HAD SOME

05:24.367 --> 05:27.567
NEGATIVE STUFF PUT UP THERE, AND

05:27.567 --> 05:30.467
ANDREW RESPONDS TO IT IN HIS

05:27.567 --> 05:30.467
WAY.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.067
[laughs]

05:30.467 --> 05:33.067
WHAT DOES "IN HIS WAY" MEAN?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.933
SO READ IT.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.933
YOU CAN READ 'EM.

05:34.933 --> 05:37.300
SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE.

05:34.933 --> 05:37.300
"I'VE BEEN BRINGING MY DOG HERE

05:37.300 --> 05:39.100
FOR SIX MONTHS.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.100
ONE NIGHT, I CAME TO PICK HIM

05:39.100 --> 05:41.367
UP.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.367
WHAT I FOUND WAS MY PUP WEARING

05:41.367 --> 05:44.933
A MUZZLE, TIED TO A WALL.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.933
MY OWN DOG--I WAS HORRIFIED."

05:44.933 --> 05:47.400
THEN YOUR RESPONSE WAS, "AFTER

05:44.933 --> 05:47.400
QUESTIONING THE STAFF, I BELIEVE

05:47.400 --> 05:50.600
THEM AND NOT YOU."

05:47.400 --> 05:50.600
YOU TOLD THE CUSTOMER THAT.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.900
YEAH.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.900
WHY?

05:52.900 --> 05:55.367
YEAH, WHY?

05:52.900 --> 05:55.367
I-I CALL IT LIKE IT IS.

05:55.367 --> 05:59.933
ANDREW, STAY THE [bleep] OFF

05:55.367 --> 05:59.933
THE INTERNET, BECAUSE YOU'RE...

05:59.933 --> 06:03.400
HURTING YOUR BUSINESS.

05:59.933 --> 06:03.400
I DON'T THINK I'M HURTING MY

06:03.400 --> 06:06.500
BUSINESS AT ALL, PERSONALLY.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.500
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT

06:06.500 --> 06:08.333
ANDREW SO FAR.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.333
THE VIBE IN THE PLACE ISN'T

06:08.333 --> 06:10.200
GREAT.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.200
I'VE SEEN SOME STUFF ONLINE,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.100
AND HIS INTERACTION WITH ME,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.100
QUITE FRANKLY, ISN'T THAT

06:12.100 --> 06:14.400
OPEN-MINDED.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.400
SO BEFORE I DO A DEAL, I NEED TO

06:14.400 --> 06:17.400
GET A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF

06:14.400 --> 06:17.400
THESE FINANCIALS.

06:17.400 --> 06:16.500
HOW ARE YOU?

06:17.400 --> 06:16.500
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.633
HI.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.633
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?

06:20.633 --> 06:24.000
I TAKE CARE OF THE MONEY.

06:20.633 --> 06:24.000
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT I CAN

06:24.000 --> 06:25.933
LOOK AT?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.933
HOW 'BOUT A P&L?

06:25.933 --> 06:28.233
YES. THIS IS APRIL.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.233
OKAY.

06:28.233 --> 06:31.633
AND THIS IS 2012.

06:28.233 --> 06:31.633
SO IN THIS MONTH, YOU KNOW

06:31.633 --> 06:35.100
HOW MUCH REVENUE YOU DID?

06:31.633 --> 06:35.100
120?

06:35.100 --> 06:37.967
109.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.967
HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE ON 109?

06:37.967 --> 06:40.933
I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.933
$78.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.333
SALES FELL OFF GREATLY, AND

06:40.933 --> 06:44.333
IT--AND IT JUST HASN'T BLOSSOMED

06:44.333 --> 06:46.500
TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.500
GROOMING HAS BEEN

06:46.500 --> 06:48.900
UNDERPERFORMING.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.900
TRAINING HAS BEEN LAGGING.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.767
OUR TOP PERFORMER IS DEFINITELY

06:48.900 --> 06:52.767
BOARDING.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.033
THIS YEAR, BOARDING'S OFF QUITE

06:52.767 --> 06:55.033
A BIT.

06:55.033 --> 06:57.500
WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPANCY?

06:55.033 --> 06:57.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.600
WE'RE GONNA THINK ABOUT THIS

06:57.500 --> 06:59.600
JUST LIKE A HOTEL--

06:59.600 --> 07:03.400
NUMBER OF BEDS, NUMBER OF

06:59.600 --> 07:03.400
NIGHTS, THE RATE PER NIGHT.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.267
THAT'S HOW A HOTEL DOES A

07:03.400 --> 07:05.267
BUDGET.

07:05.267 --> 07:07.933
THEY MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS ON

07:05.267 --> 07:07.933
SOME LEVEL OF OCCUPANCY.

07:07.933 --> 07:11.633
IF ALL OF THE RUNS AND ALL OF

07:07.933 --> 07:11.633
THE BEDS WERE OCCUPIED, YOU

07:11.633 --> 07:15.567
WOULD HAVE $1,830,000.

07:11.633 --> 07:15.567
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR LEVEL OF

07:15.567 --> 07:18.600
OCCUPANCY IS AS A PERCENTAGE

07:15.567 --> 07:18.600
OF YOUR TOTAL?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.433
DO YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.433
NO.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.467
YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER?

07:20.433 --> 07:22.467
NO.

07:22.467 --> 07:25.233
THE MAXIMUM REVENUE THAT THE

07:22.467 --> 07:25.233
KENNEL SYSTEM COULD GENERATE

07:25.233 --> 07:29.233
IS ABOUT $1.83 IF EVERY KENNEL

07:25.233 --> 07:29.233
WAS FULL EVERY NIGHT AT A STATE

07:29.233 --> 07:32.067
OF RATE.

07:29.233 --> 07:32.067
LAST YEAR, THE KENNELS GENERATED

07:32.067 --> 07:35.433
ABOUT $500,000.

07:32.067 --> 07:35.433
SO VERY SIMPLY, I JUST DIVIDE

07:35.433 --> 07:38.767
$500,000, WHICH IS WHAT THEY

07:35.433 --> 07:38.767
GENERATED, INTO THE AMOUNT THAT

07:38.767 --> 07:41.633
THEY SHOULD HAVE GENERATED, AND

07:38.767 --> 07:41.633
I COME UP WITH AN OCCUPANCY RATE

07:41.633 --> 07:45.100
OF 27%.

07:41.633 --> 07:45.100
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.167
SO THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS,

07:45.100 --> 07:48.167
ANDREW, IS YOU'RE AT THE

07:48.167 --> 07:53.300
ABSOLUTE WORST POSSIBLE LEVEL

07:48.167 --> 07:53.300
AT 27%.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.867
WE'RE OFF.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.867
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE

07:56.867 --> 07:59.533
IN YOUR JOB...WHEN YOU WAKE UP

07:56.867 --> 07:59.533
IN THE MORNING?

07:59.533 --> 08:01.233
PUTTING UP WITH ME.

07:59.533 --> 08:01.233
DEALING WITH YOU?

08:01.233 --> 08:03.400
THAT'S GOOD.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.400
ARE YOU NOT EASY TO DEAL

08:03.400 --> 08:05.233
WITH?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.233
NO.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.100
HOW COME?

08:05.233 --> 08:07.100
BECAUSE I'M VERY PASSIONATE

08:07.100 --> 08:09.667
ABOUT WHAT I DO, I KNOW WHAT I

08:07.100 --> 08:09.667
WANNA SEE, I KNOW HOW I WANT

08:09.667 --> 08:12.467
THIS PLACE TO RUN.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.467
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE TEND TO NOT

08:12.467 --> 08:15.700
FOLLOW THE PATH AND...

08:12.467 --> 08:15.700
DOES IT MAKE YOU CRAZY?

08:15.700 --> 08:17.633
YES.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.633
I DON'T WALK AROUND YELLING

08:17.633 --> 08:19.867
EVERY DAY.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.867
I WALK AROUND YELLING WHEN I

08:19.867 --> 08:22.667
NEED TO.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.667
FOR ME, IF AN EMPLOYEE

08:22.667 --> 08:25.067
DOESN'T WORK OUT, THAT'S MY

08:22.667 --> 08:25.067
FAILURE, NOT THEIRS.

08:25.067 --> 08:30.400
IF ANDREW'S TELLING ME HIMSELF

08:25.067 --> 08:30.400
THAT HE'S NOT GOOD WITH HIS

08:30.400 --> 08:33.033
THAT IT COULD BE MUCH WORSE.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.033
HEY, I'M MARCUS, HOW ARE YOU?

08:33.033 --> 08:34.400
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.400
EMPLOYEES, I HAVE TO IMAGINE

08:34.400 --> 08:36.500
RENE, JESSE'S BROTHER.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.500
OH, YOU'RE JESSE'S BROTHER.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.799
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.799
ANIMAL CARE TECH.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.100
OKAY. YOU LIKE IT?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.100
IT'S GOOD.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.332
WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT THIS

08:41.100 --> 08:43.332
PLACE?

08:43.332 --> 08:45.233
UH, JUST BEING WITH DOGS,

08:43.332 --> 08:45.233
MAN.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.267
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS

08:45.233 --> 08:47.267
GONNA LOVE YOU EVERY TIME YOU

08:47.267 --> 08:49.367
COME IN WHETHER IT'S A BAD DAY

08:47.267 --> 08:49.367
OR A GOOD DAY, YOU GOT A HAPPY

08:49.367 --> 08:51.400
DOG WITH YOU.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.400
HOW DO YOU LIKE WORKING WITH

08:51.400 --> 08:55.067
ANDREW?

08:51.400 --> 08:55.067
UH...

08:55.067 --> 08:57.633
IT CAN BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED

08:55.067 --> 08:57.633
TO EXPLAIN.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.733
SEEMS LIKE HE GETS A

08:57.633 --> 08:59.733
LITTLE...

08:59.733 --> 09:03.367
UH...

08:59.733 --> 09:03.367
YOU GOTTA WORK.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.333
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, MAN, WELL,

09:03.367 --> 09:05.333
GOOD MEETING YOU.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.200
I'LL BE SEEING YOU AROUND.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.200
SOUNDS GOOD.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.733
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.733
HEY, JESSE, CAN I GRAB YOU FOR A

09:09.733 --> 09:12.867
MINUTE, BUD?

09:09.733 --> 09:12.867
YEAH.

09:12.867 --> 09:15.800
JESSE'S THE PARK MANAGER, AND

09:12.867 --> 09:15.800
HE'S A CRITICAL STAFF MEMBER.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.633
I MEAN, HE'S RUNNING WHAT I

09:15.800 --> 09:20.633
CONSIDER 50% OF THIS BUSINESS,

09:20.633 --> 09:23.533
SO YOU AND I HAVEN'T HAD A

09:20.633 --> 09:23.533
CHANCE TO TALK OR ANYTHING.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.333
DO YOU WANNA BE HERE LONG-TERM?

09:23.533 --> 09:25.333
THE CENTER OF THE BUSINESS.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.467
ACTUALLY, YEAH, I LOVE IT

09:25.333 --> 09:27.467
HERE.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.300
I MEAN, I BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS

09:27.467 --> 09:29.300
NOW.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.400
I MEAN, I BEEN PROBABLY THE

09:29.300 --> 09:31.400
LONGEST ONE HERE AND WORKED

09:31.400 --> 09:34.933
EVERY SHIFT IMAGINABLE HERE.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.933
I MEAN, I KNOW THE PLACE INSIDE

09:34.933 --> 09:37.933
AND OUT.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.933
HOW DO YOU LIKE WORKING WITH

09:36.733 --> 09:37.933
ANDREW?

09:42.433 --> 09:44.500
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT SEEMS

09:42.433 --> 09:44.500
LIKE YOU WORK HARD, YOU'RE

09:44.500 --> 09:47.167
POSITIVE.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.167
OH, I MEAN, I HAVE TO BE.

09:47.167 --> 09:51.033
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, BUDDY.

09:47.167 --> 09:51.033
COME ON, SOOKS.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.233
NEIL? MARCUS.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.233
YOU HAVE TO BE.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.367
MARCUS. NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.367
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.367
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WOULD BE THE

09:54.367 --> 09:56.367
SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE

09:56.367 --> 09:59.033
ORGANIZATION?

09:56.367 --> 09:59.033
IT STARTS AT THE TOP.

09:59.033 --> 10:02.633
IT'S A REALLY DYNAMITE FACILITY

09:59.033 --> 10:02.633
WITH A WELL-THOUGHT OUT SYSTEM.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.333
BUT I DON'T THINK ANDREW IS

10:02.633 --> 10:05.333
RATIONAL.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.567
YEAH, ERIN TOLD ME HE FLIES

10:05.333 --> 10:07.567
OFF THE HANDLE...[snaps]...

10:07.567 --> 10:11.700
IN A NANOSECOND.

10:07.567 --> 10:11.700
HE HAS HAD SEVERAL EXPLOSIONS

10:11.700 --> 10:14.200
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.200
WHY WOULD SOMEONE LIKE YOU

10:14.200 --> 10:17.767
PUT UP WITH STUFF LIKE THAT?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.767
I LOVE THE ANIMALS, BUT I

10:17.767 --> 10:20.200
HAVE MY LIMITS.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.200
MAN-TO-MAN...I'M PLANNING MY

10:20.200 --> 10:22.967
EXIT.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.967
ARE OTHER PEOPLE TOO?

10:22.967 --> 10:27.633
YES.

10:22.967 --> 10:27.633
AND WHY DO YOU WANNA LEAVE?

10:27.633 --> 10:30.067
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS IS

10:27.633 --> 10:30.067
I GOT BIT RECENTLY.

10:30.067 --> 10:32.467
ANDREW LITERALLY GOT IN MY FACE

10:30.067 --> 10:32.467
AND YELLED AT ME AND BLAMED ME

10:32.467 --> 10:34.800
FOR IT.

10:32.467 --> 10:34.800
IN FRONT OF OTHER EMPLOYEES?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.467
YES. AND THAT'S THE THING.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.467
I MEAN, EVERYBODY ELSE RESPONDED

10:37.467 --> 10:40.467
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD.

10:37.467 --> 10:40.467
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT,

10:40.467 --> 10:43.233
I'M NOT A VIOLENT GUY, BUT I

10:40.467 --> 10:43.233
WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LEFT HERE IN

10:43.233 --> 10:49.867
HANDCUFFS AND ANDREW IN AN

10:43.233 --> 10:49.867
AMBULANCE.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.033
I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE JUST

10:49.867 --> 10:52.033
GO INTO THE TRAINING ROOM AND

10:52.033 --> 10:53.933
TALK.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.933
NOW?

10:53.933 --> 10:55.900
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

10:53.933 --> 10:55.900
YEAH, SURE.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.767
I CAME HERE TO DO BUSINESS,

10:55.900 --> 10:57.767
AND INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON

10:57.767 --> 10:59.933
BUSINESS, WE'RE FOCUSING ON HIM

10:57.767 --> 10:59.933
YELLING.

10:59.933 --> 11:02.733
YELLING AT EMPLOYEES COULD BE

10:59.933 --> 11:02.733
THE MOST INEXCUSABLE BEHAVIOR OF

11:02.733 --> 11:05.500
ANY KIND, AND IF I'M GONNA MAKE

11:02.733 --> 11:05.500
A DEAL WITH THIS GUY, THERE'S NO

11:05.500 --> 11:08.267
WAY THAT I'M GONNA LET ANDREW

11:05.500 --> 11:08.267
INTERACT WITH HIS EMPLOYEES ONCE

11:08.267 --> 11:12.433
I'M HERE.

11:08.267 --> 11:12.433
I LOOKED AT 600 BUSINESSES,

11:12.433 --> 11:15.633
AND I LIKE THIS CONCEPT.

11:12.433 --> 11:15.633
I'M WILLING TO WRITE A CHECK...

11:15.633 --> 11:18.300
MM-HMM.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.300
AND FUND WHAT I THINK NEEDS

11:18.300 --> 11:20.200
TO HAPPEN.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.200
MM-HMM.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.533
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO IT--

11:20.200 --> 11:22.533
I WILL NOT DO IT--IF YOU'RE

11:22.533 --> 11:27.133
MANAGING THE PEOPLE.

11:22.533 --> 11:27.133
YOU DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY...

11:27.133 --> 11:29.167
LIKE PEOPLE.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.167
I MEAN, THAT'S A VERY BROAD

11:29.167 --> 11:31.800
STATEMENT, BECAUSE I REALLY AM

11:29.167 --> 11:31.800
GOOD WITH PEOPLE, IT'S--

11:31.800 --> 11:33.833
YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS YOU

11:31.800 --> 11:33.833
SHOULD BE AS A BUSINESS OWNER

11:33.833 --> 11:36.100
WITH PEOPLE.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.100
MAYBE I DON'T HANDLE MY STAFF

11:36.100 --> 11:38.233
WELL, IF--IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

11:36.100 --> 11:38.233
SAYING.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.500
I'M SAYING THAT YOU DON'T

11:38.233 --> 11:40.500
HANDLE YOUR STAFF WELL OR YOUR

11:40.500 --> 11:44.833
CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS YOU SHOULD.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.833
HE'S GOT A GREAT CONCEPT HERE,

11:44.833 --> 11:47.467
AND I THINK I CAN TAKE THIS

11:44.833 --> 11:47.467
CONCEPT AND REALLY SCALE IT

11:47.467 --> 11:50.033
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

11:47.467 --> 11:50.033
BUT I'M GONNA PUT A VERY TIGHT

11:50.033 --> 11:52.300
LEASH ON HIM, AND I'M GONNA KEEP

11:50.033 --> 11:52.300
HIM AWAY FROM THE CUSTOMERS AND

11:52.300 --> 11:54.667
THE EMPLOYEES.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.667
WHY DO YOU WANT LA DOGWORKS?

11:54.667 --> 11:58.567
'CAUSE I LIKE THE BRAND, AND

11:54.667 --> 11:58.567
FOR ME, IT'S CREATING PRODUCTS

11:58.567 --> 12:02.333
AND SERVICES UNDER THE LA

11:58.567 --> 12:02.333
DOGWORKS BRAND THAT ARE SCALABLE

12:02.333 --> 12:06.100
AND THAT ARE SOLD IN MASS

12:02.333 --> 12:06.100
RETAIL, ONLINE, AND OPENING UP

12:06.100 --> 12:09.000
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.000
WE'RE ONLY GONNA OPEN UP NEW

12:09.000 --> 12:11.433
LOCATIONS WHEN I'M CONFIDENT

12:09.000 --> 12:11.433
THAT THIS LOCATION IS

12:11.433 --> 12:13.733
FUNCTIONING THE WAY IT'S

12:11.433 --> 12:13.733
SUPPOSED TO BE...INCLUDING THE

12:13.733 --> 12:16.667
MORALE.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.667
OKAY.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.233
ANDREW, I'M GONNA OFFER YOU

CONTINUES.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.300
HE ACTUALLY GETS EVEN MORE AMPED

18:56.300 --> 18:58.033
UP.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.033
AND THEN HE COMES UP TO MY

18:58.033 --> 19:01.000
OFFICE YELLING AND SCREAMING AT

18:58.033 --> 19:01.000
ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN MORE

19:01.000 --> 19:03.300
COMPASSION.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.300
BUT I THINK WHEN THAT

19:03.300 --> 19:05.833
HAPPENS, I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE

19:03.300 --> 19:05.833
LOOKING FOR IS SOME LEVEL OF

19:05.833 --> 19:09.200
SYMPATHY.

19:05.833 --> 19:09.200
THAT'S NOT--AGAIN, MY STAFF

19:09.200 --> 19:12.267
HAS TO FUNCTION A RIGHT WAY.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.267
I KNOW.

19:12.267 --> 19:14.400
WHEN NEIL STARTED WORKING

19:12.267 --> 19:14.400
HERE, AND I TOLD HIM TO THIS--

19:14.400 --> 19:16.500
TO HIS FACE--I HAD BIG HOPES FOR

19:14.400 --> 19:16.500
HIM.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
WHEN YOU SAY THAT TO

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
SOMEBODY, "I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR

19:18.500 --> 19:20.700
YOU..."

19:18.500 --> 19:20.700
NEIL DID NOT HEAR THAT FROM

19:20.700 --> 19:24.533
ME UNTIL WE HAD A HUGE ARGUMENT

19:20.700 --> 19:24.533
IN THE KITCHEN WHEN HE GOT IN MY

19:24.533 --> 19:27.567
FACE WITH HIS WIDE EYES--

19:24.533 --> 19:27.567
I-I GOT IN YOUR FACE?

19:27.567 --> 19:32.033
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THAT?

19:27.567 --> 19:32.033
I DON'T REMEMBER IT THAT WAY.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.333
WELL, MY BACK WAS TO THE DOOR

19:32.033 --> 19:34.333
AND YOU WERE STANDING HERE

19:34.333 --> 19:37.500
STARING ME DOWN AND I SAID,

19:34.333 --> 19:37.500
"WHO THE [bleep] DO YOU THINK

19:37.500 --> 19:41.767
YOU ARE STARING ME DOWN?"

19:37.500 --> 19:41.767
[inhales]

19:41.767 --> 19:44.467
DON'T REMEMBER THAT?

19:41.767 --> 19:44.467
I REMEMBER IT DIFFERENTLY.

19:44.467 --> 19:47.200
OKAY, WELL...

19:44.467 --> 19:47.200
IN THAT INSTANCE WHERE HE

19:47.200 --> 19:49.567
PULLED THE DOG--DID YOU THINK

19:47.200 --> 19:49.567
NEIL WAS OUT OF LINE?

19:49.567 --> 19:52.167
NO, NOT OUT OF LINE, JUST

19:49.567 --> 19:52.167
DOING A STUPID THING.

19:52.167 --> 19:55.467
HE JUST DID THE WRONG THING.

19:52.167 --> 19:55.467
A THING THAT NOBODY ELSE WOULD

19:55.467 --> 19:58.833
DO.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.833
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.833
OKAY--NO, NO--IS THERE A

19:58.833 --> 20:00.833
PROBLEM?

20:00.833 --> 20:05.200
[dogs barking]

20:00.833 --> 20:05.200
HE'S GONNA GET FIRED ANYWAY.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.100
WHY'S THAT?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.100
BECAUSE I [bleep] CAN'T STAND

20:07.100 --> 20:09.367
HIM.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.367
HE'S INSUBORDINATE, HE'S

20:09.367 --> 20:13.433
OBNOXIOUS.

20:09.367 --> 20:13.433
DON'T LET HIM MANIPULATE YOU,

20:13.433 --> 20:17.300
JUST WORTHLESS.

20:13.433 --> 20:17.300
ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.367
COMING UP...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.367
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF

20:19.367 --> 20:21.333
WHAT'S GONE ON HERE.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.333
THE HISTORY IS THAT THE

20:21.333 --> 20:23.767
PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE DON'T

20:21.333 --> 20:23.767
[bleep] WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE!

20:23.767 --> 20:27.167
ANDREW, THIS IS DR. RIVERA.

20:23.767 --> 20:27.167
SHE'S WORKED WITH ME IN OTHER

20:27.167 --> 20:28.267
COMPANIES IN TRYING TO HELP

20:27.167 --> 20:28.267
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU, HE IS

20:28.267 --> 20:29.533
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

20:28.267 --> 20:29.533
HA HA HA HA HA!

20:29.533 --> 20:35.633
HA HA HA HA HA!

20:29.533 --> 20:35.633
HA HA HA HA HA!

20:35.633 --> 20:38.033
TOGETHER.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.033
WE NEED TO TALK AS A GROUP NOW.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.667
AS SOON AS I SAW THE EXTENT OF

20:38.033 --> 20:41.667
ANDREW'S RAGE FOR HIS EMPLOYEES,

20:41.667 --> 20:43.167
I REALIZED I NEEDED TO GET ALL

20:41.667 --> 20:43.167
WE NEED TO GATHER EVERYBODY

20:43.167 --> 20:45.200
THE EMPLOYEES TOGETHER

20:43.167 --> 20:45.200
IMMEDIATELY.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.400
THIS IS THE TIME--THIS IS LIKE A

20:45.200 --> 20:47.400
GROUP THERAPY SESSION.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.600
I MEAN, LISTEN, A LOT OF TIMES

20:47.400 --> 20:49.600
THINGS CAN BE SOLVED IF PEOPLE

20:49.600 --> 20:55.333
CAN JUST TALK THEM OUT.

20:49.600 --> 20:55.333
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, ANDREW, FOR YOU

20:55.333 --> 20:57.500
FEEL ANYMORE.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.500
YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.867
I DON'T DISMISS.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.867
YOU DO.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.933
NO, I DON'T DISMISS.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.933
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU DO.

21:01.933 --> 21:03.067
NO, I DON'T.

21:01.933 --> 21:03.067
TO DISMISS HOW THESE PEOPLE

21:03.067 --> 21:04.900
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU DO.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.900
NO, I DON'T DISMISS.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.300
YOU DON'T TRY TO EMPATHIZE

21:04.900 --> 21:07.300
OR FEEL WHAT THEY'RE FEELING.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.100
EVERYTHING IS JUST--HANDLE IT.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.100
DO IT, FIX IT.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
FOR ME TO GET YOU GUYS TO DO

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
THINGS WASN'T ALWAYS SO EASY.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.000
'CAUSE WE HAD OTHER THINGS TO

21:13.100 --> 21:16.000
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO

21:16.000 --> 21:17.833
DO.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.833
YOU'RE SAYING THE WHOLE

21:17.833 --> 21:14.233
PROBLEM WAS WE HAD NO

21:17.833 --> 21:14.233
ORGANIZATION, THINGS WEREN'T

21:14.233 --> 21:20.900
DO.

21:14.233 --> 21:20.900
GETTING DONE THAT YOU WANTED US

21:20.900 --> 21:22.833
TO GET DONE.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.833
BUT YOU EXPECT THREE PEOPLE TO

21:22.833 --> 21:24.833
TAKE CARE OF 50 DOGS A DAY PLUS

21:22.833 --> 21:24.833
DO DROP-OFFS AND PICKUPS, MAKING

21:24.833 --> 21:26.900
SURE THEY GET MEDICATION, THEY

21:24.833 --> 21:26.900
GET THEIR FOOD, AND WE CLEAN THE

21:26.900 --> 21:29.067
WHOLE BUILDING.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.067
ALL THAT STUFF WITH THREE PEOPLE

21:29.067 --> 21:31.267
IS NOT POSSIBLE.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.267
WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE THINGS

21:31.267 --> 21:33.500
WORK.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.500
NO, I KNOW, BUT--

21:33.500 --> 21:36.667
UTILIZING OUR TIME PROPERLY.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.667
YOU FOCUS SO MUCH ON WHAT

21:36.667 --> 21:38.733
DOESN'T GET DONE THAT IT MAKES

21:36.667 --> 21:38.733
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY'RE

21:38.733 --> 21:40.933
WORTHLESS.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.933
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT HAVING TO PAY

21:40.933 --> 21:43.533
ANYBODY ANYTHING, AND PEOPLE

21:40.933 --> 21:43.533
WORK REALLY HARD.

21:43.533 --> 21:46.200
I FEEL YOU DISMISS IT.

21:43.533 --> 21:46.200
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT--

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
OKAY, YOU'RE INCORRECT IN

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
YOUR FEELINGS.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.133
I HAVE TRIED, AND I'VE TRIED TO

21:48.200 --> 21:50.133
COMMUNICATE, AND I'LL TELL YOU

21:50.133 --> 21:52.400
SOMETHING--IT DOESN'T WORK ALL

21:50.133 --> 21:52.400
THE TIME.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.167
THEY'RE SCARED OF HOW YOU'RE

21:52.400 --> 21:55.167
GONNA REACT.

21:55.167 --> 21:57.467
AND THAT'S A BIG ONE TOO,

21:55.167 --> 21:57.467
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE YOU

21:57.467 --> 21:59.400
RANTING AND YELLING AT ME WHEN

21:57.467 --> 21:59.400
I'M INSIDE DOG AREA, SO THEN

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "OH, [bleep],

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
I'M NOT GONNA GO TALK TO HIM."

22:01.400 --> 22:03.600
PEOPLE AVOID YOU.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.600
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS MY

22:03.600 --> 22:07.533
PERSONALITY, KNOWS THE WAY I AM.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.533
I'M A REACTIONARY, OKAY?

22:07.533 --> 22:09.400
I'LL YELL AND SCREAM, AND THEN

22:07.533 --> 22:09.400
IT'S FINE.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.867
YEAH, BUT I MEAN, FOR YOU.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.867
AND THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO

22:11.867 --> 22:14.033
FOR MY HEALTH.

22:11.867 --> 22:14.033
AND FOR MY HEALTH, I'M SORRY,

22:14.033 --> 22:16.033
IT'S NOT WORKING, 'CAUSE I'M

22:14.033 --> 22:16.033
STRESSED OUT--I GO HOME

22:16.033 --> 22:18.267
STRESSED AS HELL, DUDE, I DON'T

22:16.033 --> 22:18.267
SEE MY WIFE AS MUCH, 'CAUSE I

22:18.267 --> 22:19.900
HAVE TO DO THESE EXTRA HOURS.

22:18.267 --> 22:19.900
YOU DON'T THINK I WORK ENOUGH.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.967
THIS JOB HAS REALLY STRESSED ME

22:19.900 --> 22:21.967
OUT.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.300
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.300
ANDREW, YOU GOTTA LISTEN--

22:24.300 --> 22:26.233
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!

22:24.300 --> 22:26.233
I LISTEN TO EVERYTHING.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.967
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

22:26.233 --> 22:28.967
DOES HE LISTEN--YES OR NO?

22:28.967 --> 22:31.400
NO.

22:28.967 --> 22:31.400
IT'S OKAY.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.133
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, RIGHT?

22:31.400 --> 22:33.133
YES.

22:33.133 --> 22:36.267
OKAY, JUST TELL HIM HOW YOU

22:33.133 --> 22:36.267
FEEL.

22:36.267 --> 22:35.100
I'M LISTENING.

22:36.267 --> 22:35.100
OKAY. GO AHEAD.

22:35.100 --> 22:39.767
HE'S NOT GONNA GET MAD.

22:35.100 --> 22:39.767
IT'S OUR LIVELIHOOD HERE.

22:39.767 --> 22:43.333
[crying]

22:39.767 --> 22:43.333
AND IT'S JUST NEVER BEEN

22:43.333 --> 22:45.733
CONSIDERED.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.733
EMILY, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE--

22:45.733 --> 22:47.767
WE'RE WORKING SO HARD.

22:45.733 --> 22:47.767
BUT EXPLAIN WHAT'S BEEN GOING

22:47.767 --> 22:51.000
ON SO MARCUS UNDERSTANDS.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.000
NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.033
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.033
NO, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.033
NO, BECAUSE--

22:53.033 --> 22:55.033
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:55.033 --> 22:56.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I DON'T

22:55.033 --> 22:56.900
UNDERSTAND?

22:56.900 --> 22:58.967
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THE

22:56.900 --> 22:58.967
HISTORY OF WHAT'S GONE ON HERE.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.167
THE HISTORY IS THE PEOPLE

22:58.967 --> 23:01.167
THAT WORK HERE DON'T [bleep]

23:01.167 --> 23:03.600
WANNA DO IT ANYMORE!

23:01.167 --> 23:03.600
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.667
THAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.667
THAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT, MARCUS.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.767
YOU KNOW WHAT THE EASY WAY

23:06.667 --> 23:08.767
OUT FOR ALL THEM IS?

23:08.767 --> 23:10.633
WHAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT?

23:08.767 --> 23:10.633
LEAVE.

23:10.633 --> 23:12.567
WHAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT?

23:10.633 --> 23:12.567
TO LEAVE.

23:12.567 --> 23:14.200
WHAT'S THE--

23:12.567 --> 23:14.200
I QUIT.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.567
TO LEAVE.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.567
TO LEAVE--THAT'S THEIR EASY

23:16.567 --> 23:18.633
WAY OUT.

23:16.567 --> 23:18.633
AND THEN YOU'LL BE TOTALLY UP

23:18.633 --> 23:22.000
[bleep] CREEK.

23:18.633 --> 23:22.000
NOW, THAT--THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.533
I'M NOT GONNA LET THESE

23:22.000 --> 23:25.533
PEOPLE SUFFER BECAUSE YOU'RE A

23:25.533 --> 23:28.167
[bleep] COMMUNICATOR.

23:25.533 --> 23:28.167
WE'RE GONNA FIX IT.

23:28.167 --> 23:31.533
THEY ARE LOYAL TO YOU FOR SOME

23:28.167 --> 23:31.533
CRAZY REASON.

23:31.533 --> 23:33.800
I HAVE NO IDEA.

23:31.533 --> 23:33.800
BUT I'M SURPRISED THEY ALL

23:33.800 --> 23:36.500
HAVEN'T LEFT.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.500
ANDREW CONTINUES TO BE IGNORANT

23:36.500 --> 23:39.867
TO THE FACT THAT THESE EMPLOYEES

23:36.500 --> 23:39.867
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

23:39.867 --> 23:42.933
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND

23:39.867 --> 23:42.933
THAT THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE WITH

23:42.933 --> 23:46.233
REAL FEELINGS WHO HAVE A PASSION

23:42.933 --> 23:46.233
FOR HIS BUSINESS...AND THAT

23:46.233 --> 23:48.433
THESE PEOPLE, IF TREATED

23:46.233 --> 23:48.433
PROPERLY, WILL MAKE HIM A LOT OF

23:48.433 --> 23:51.000
MONEY.

23:48.433 --> 23:51.000
WE ARE GONNA LEAVE THE PAST.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.433
WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

23:53.567 --> 23:58.767
TOGETHER.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.767
GUYS, THANK YOU, OKAY?

24:06.633 --> 24:09.267
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.

24:06.633 --> 24:09.267
I DIDN'T LIKE BEING AMBUSHED

24:09.267 --> 24:11.467
TODAY.

24:09.267 --> 24:11.467
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN

24:11.467 --> 24:13.600
SOMEBODY FALLS OR SOMEBODY GETS

24:11.467 --> 24:13.600
KNOCKED DOWN AND THEN YOU KICK

24:13.600 --> 24:16.067
THEM AND THEN, OH, LOOK, AND

24:13.600 --> 24:16.067
THEN THE NEXT ONE KICKS THEM

24:16.067 --> 24:18.833
AND THEY'RE KICKING AND THEN I'M

24:16.067 --> 24:18.833
LIKE, "WHOA!" YOU KNOW?

24:18.833 --> 24:22.100
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

24:18.833 --> 24:22.100
I CREATED THIS BUSINESS...

24:22.100 --> 24:25.433
AND I SHOWED EVERYBODY HOW TO DO

24:22.100 --> 24:25.433
IT.

24:25.433 --> 24:28.233
THIS IS MY HAPPINESS.

24:25.433 --> 24:28.233
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU THE BEST

24:28.233 --> 24:30.767
BUSINESS OWNER THAT'S EVER

24:28.233 --> 24:30.767
LIVED...

24:30.767 --> 24:34.033
THANK YOU!

24:30.767 --> 24:34.033
BUT YOU HAVE TO SHUT UP ONCE

24:34.033 --> 24:36.300
IN A WHILE.

24:34.033 --> 24:36.300
AND LET 'EM JUST TALK.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.567
IT'S SO DIFFICULT FOR ME.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.567
I'M SORRY.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.700
IT IS, BUT WHAT'S THE

24:38.567 --> 24:40.700
DISADVANTAGE OF LETTING THEM GET

24:40.700 --> 24:43.300
IT OUT?

24:40.700 --> 24:43.300
ANDREW HAS WHAT I CALL DELUSIONS

24:43.300 --> 24:45.833
OF GRANDEUR.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.833
HE THINKS HE'S BIGGER AND BETTER

24:45.833 --> 24:48.467
THAN HE ACTUALLY IS.

24:45.833 --> 24:48.467
HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIS

24:48.467 --> 24:52.267
EMPLOYEES, AND THE SMALLEST OF

24:48.467 --> 24:52.267
THINGS SET HIM OFF.

24:52.267 --> 24:55.100
INSTEAD OF COUNSELING HIS

24:52.267 --> 24:55.100
EMPLOYEES AND TEACHING THEM AND

24:55.100 --> 24:59.600
TRAINING THEM AND BEING A GOOD

24:55.100 --> 24:59.600

24:59.600 --> 25:05.033

25:01.033 --> 25:05.033
MYSELF, PLEASE?

25:02.133 --> 25:05.033
SURE.

25:15.433 --> 25:18.600

25:15.433 --> 25:18.600
HE'S NOT HERE.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.500
HE'S OFF TODAY?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.500

25:21.500 --> 25:24.800

25:24.800 --> 25:27.500
ALL THESE GREAT PLANS.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.500
INSTEAD, I WALKED IN TO SOME

25:27.500 --> 25:29.767
REALLY BIG PROBLEMS.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.767
JESSE QUIT.

25:29.767 --> 25:31.733
YEAH. HE WAS HAVING A

25:29.767 --> 25:31.733
CONVERSATION WITH ERIN, AND HE

25:31.733 --> 25:34.100
GOT UP AND QUIT.

25:31.733 --> 25:34.100
I MADE A DECISION--

25:34.100 --> 25:36.633
WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL THESE

25:34.100 --> 25:36.633
PEOPLE QUIT?

25:36.633 --> 25:39.067
THEN WE HIRE NEW PEOPLE.

25:36.633 --> 25:39.067
ANDREW, YOU'RE STILL

25:39.067 --> 25:41.667

YOU'RE MANAGING THEM...LIKE

25:41.667 --> 25:45.367
SERVANTS.

25:45.367 --> 25:48.833
AND WITHOUT THEM, WE'RE CLOSED.

25:45.367 --> 25:48.833
THIS IS A MOMENT THAT I'VE

25:48.833 --> 25:51.400
WORRIED ABOUT, AND I'VE WARNED

25:48.833 --> 25:51.400
ANDREW ABOUT THIS.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.867
IF PEOPLE AREN'T TREATED

25:51.400 --> 25:53.867
PROPERLY, THEY'RE GONNA REBEL AT

25:53.867 --> 25:56.300
SOME POINT.

25:53.867 --> 25:56.300
AND WHAT I'M STARTING TO SENSE

25:56.300 --> 25:58.267
IS THERE'S MUTINY ABOUT TO

29:14.567 --> 29:18.133

30:00.567 --> 30:03.567
QUALITIES YOU SEE IN NEIL.

30:00.567 --> 30:03.567
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN NEIL

30:03.567 --> 30:06.567

30:03.567 --> 30:06.567

30:11.567 --> 30:14.167
YOU AND ANDREW?

30:11.567 --> 30:14.167
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

30:14.167 --> 30:15.500

30:14.167 --> 30:15.500
SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH

THIS DOG STARTED CHARGING OUT OF

30:15.500 --> 30:17.700
THE RUN.

30:17.700 --> 30:20.467
MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS, "PROTECT

30:17.700 --> 30:20.467
THIS DOG FROM RUNNING DOWN THE

30:20.467 --> 30:23.567
STREET," AND THE DOG LATCHED

30:20.467 --> 30:23.567
ONTO MY ARM AND LITERALLY HE

30:23.567 --> 30:26.033
SAID TO ME, "WELL, LOOK HOW

30:23.567 --> 30:26.033
YOU'RE HANDLING THE DOG!"

30:26.033 --> 30:28.633
AND I WAS LIKE, UH--UH--YOU

30:26.033 --> 30:28.633
KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S LIKE--

30:28.633 --> 30:31.000
DAMAGE CONTROL.

30:28.633 --> 30:31.000
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
IS WHAT I SAID.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
NEITHER OF THOSE STATEMENTS

30:33.000 --> 30:37.133
ANY WAY TO ME SOUND LIKE THEY

30:33.000 --> 30:37.133
HAVE ANY, UM, LEVEL OF CONCERN

30:37.133 --> 30:40.267
IN YOUR EMPLOYEE'S HEALTH,

30:37.133 --> 30:40.267
THOUGH.

30:40.267 --> 30:43.467
LET'S BE HONEST, RIGHT?

30:40.267 --> 30:43.467
THIS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE NEIL,

30:43.467 --> 30:45.900
YOU FELT YOU WEREN'T BEING TAKEN

30:43.467 --> 30:45.900
CARE OF BY YOUR EMPLOYER IN THAT

30:45.900 --> 30:48.000
MOMENT.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.000
WELL, WHEN YOU WORK IN A

30:48.000 --> 30:50.833
PLACE LIKE THIS, BITING CAN BE

30:48.000 --> 30:50.833
INEVITABLE WITH THAT MANY DOGS,

30:50.833 --> 30:54.033
BUT IT'S JUST HOW YOU HANDLE IT.

30:50.833 --> 30:54.033
I WENT UP INTO THE OFFICE AND I

30:54.033 --> 30:56.967
SAID, "NEXT TIME I GET BIT,

30:54.033 --> 30:56.967
PLEASE SHOW SOME COMPASSION."

30:56.967 --> 30:59.267
AT THAT POINT, HE STARTED

30:56.967 --> 30:59.267
SCREAMING AT ME, AND HE WAS

30:59.267 --> 31:03.300
BEING SO TOXIC AND HOSTILE IN MY

30:59.267 --> 31:03.300
FACE.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.700
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED

31:03.300 --> 31:05.700
AT ALL.

31:05.700 --> 31:10.767
HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND...

31:05.700 --> 31:10.767
REALLY CHALLENGED ME IN FRONT OF

31:10.767 --> 31:13.867
PEOPLE.

31:10.767 --> 31:13.867
AND I SAID, "WHAT IS YOUR

31:13.867 --> 31:18.833
PROBLEM?"

31:13.867 --> 31:18.833
AND HE GOES LIKE THIS...

31:18.833 --> 31:21.267
[whispers] OH, MY GOD.

31:18.833 --> 31:21.267
NOT OH, MY GOD.

31:21.267 --> 31:24.867
NOT OH, MY GOD.

31:21.267 --> 31:24.867
I DID NOT GET IN HIS FACE.

31:24.867 --> 31:27.600
THIS IS THE ENERGY THAT I HAD

31:24.867 --> 31:27.600
WHEN HE WAS SCREAMING THE

31:27.600 --> 31:29.933
F WORD IN MY FACE.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.933
"WHAT THE [bleep]--"

31:29.933 --> 31:31.767
IT JUST--THERE WAS NO STOPPING

31:29.933 --> 31:31.767
IT.

31:31.767 --> 31:39.467
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID, YOU

31:31.767 --> 31:39.467
FRICKING MORON!

31:39.467 --> 31:42.733
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID, YOU

31:39.467 --> 31:42.733
FRICKING MORON!

31:42.733 --> 31:45.267
YOU JUST THREW A PRETTY ROUGH

31:42.733 --> 31:45.267
INSULT AT NEIL.

31:45.267 --> 31:48.800
THAT'S--I DON'T CARE!

31:45.267 --> 31:48.800
I HAVE HEARD MORE STORIES ABOUT

31:48.800 --> 31:51.667
NEIL AND NEIL COMPLAINING ABOUT

31:48.800 --> 31:51.667
THIS AND CALLING ME NAMES AND

31:51.667 --> 31:54.333
I'M QUITTING AND HE'S OUT OF HIS

31:51.667 --> 31:54.333
[bleep] MIND AND NAH, NAH, NAH,

31:54.333 --> 31:56.400
NAH, NAH.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.400
YOU SAY THE WRONG THING TO HIM

31:56.400 --> 31:33.133
AND IT'S, "HOLY [bleep]!"

31:56.400 --> 31:33.133
I'M THINKING THAT PROBABLY

31:33.133 --> 32:01.333
FRICKING MORON!

31:33.133 --> 32:01.333
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST INSULT

32:01.333 --> 32:06.567
YOU'VE GOTTEN, NEIL.

32:01.333 --> 32:06.567
SO I'M WONDERING...WOW!

32:06.567 --> 32:10.100
NEIL, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

32:06.567 --> 32:10.100
HE TOLD ME HE WAS QUITTING.

32:10.100 --> 32:13.067
ARE YOU WAITING FOR THAT?

32:10.100 --> 32:13.067
I'M NOT FIRING HIM.

32:13.067 --> 32:15.267
WHY NOT?

32:13.067 --> 32:15.267
'CAUSE I DON'T DEAL WITH HIM

32:15.267 --> 32:17.400
EVERY DAY.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.400
HE DOES HIS JOB.

32:17.400 --> 32:23.233
HE ADDS VALUE AS AN EMPLOYEE.

32:17.400 --> 32:23.233
HE ADDS VALUE AS AN EMPLOYEE.

32:23.233 --> 32:26.567
INTENTION OF FIRING HIM.

32:23.233 --> 32:26.567
I NEVER DID.

32:26.567 --> 32:21.900
THERE'S JUST A DIFFERENCE OF

32:26.567 --> 32:21.900
OPINION ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,

32:21.900 --> 32:32.033
OKAY. SO YOU DON'T HAVE AN

32:21.900 --> 32:32.033
AND, QUITE HONESTLY, IT'S HIS

32:32.033 --> 32:34.533
RESPONSIBILITY...

32:32.033 --> 32:34.533
TO WHAT?

32:34.533 --> 32:38.033
TO MAKE IT WORK--NOT HIS.

32:34.533 --> 32:38.033
NEIL, I'M SORRY.

32:38.033 --> 32:41.033
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN MOVE

32:38.033 --> 32:41.033
PAST THIS?

32:41.033 --> 32:43.433
HOW HARD IS THAT?

32:41.033 --> 32:43.433
WELL, MAYBE WE'LL DO IT

32:43.433 --> 32:46.433
ANOTHER TIME.

32:43.433 --> 32:46.433
WHY ANOTHER TIME?

32:46.433 --> 32:48.433
REAL.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.433
I DON'T WANT--

32:48.433 --> 32:49.333
YOU DON'T NEED TO USE

32:48.433 --> 32:49.333
BECAUSE MAYBE IT--IT'LL BE

32:49.333 --> 32:53.767
MARCUS'S WORDS--YOU USE YOUR OWN

32:49.333 --> 32:53.767
WORDS.

32:53.767 --> 33:00.100
LET'S GO AHEAD--I'LL HELP YOU

32:55.067 --> 33:00.100
WITH DINNER, NEIL.

32:56.767 --> 33:00.100
TALK TO ANDREW.

33:08.267 --> 33:11.167
HE NEEDS TO LEARN THAT IT'S OKAY

33:08.267 --> 33:11.167
TO SAY, "I'M SORRY."

33:11.167 --> 33:13.367
WHO'S GONNA TEACH HIM?

33:11.167 --> 33:13.367
I CAN'T HELP--I NEED YOUR HELP

33:13.367 --> 33:16.067
BECAUSE HE'S NEVER GONNA MOVE

33:13.367 --> 33:16.067
ON, EVER.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.867
RIGHT.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.867
SLACK, SLACK, SLACK.

33:18.867 --> 33:20.900
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO ASK

33:18.867 --> 33:20.900
SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING?

33:20.900 --> 33:22.967
IT'S GOTTA STOP.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.967
SO ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

33:22.967 --> 33:25.633
THINGS I HEARD WAS MARCUS TALK

33:22.967 --> 33:25.633
ABOUT THE QUALITIES HE SEES IN

33:25.633 --> 33:28.200
NEIL.

33:25.633 --> 33:28.200
I FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY NEED TO

33:28.200 --> 33:30.167
HEAR THAT.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.167
I SEE QUALITIES, AND I'VE

33:30.167 --> 33:33.567
TOLD HIM I SEE QUALITIES IN HIM.

33:30.167 --> 33:33.567
LET'S HEAR IT.

33:33.567 --> 33:35.900
I SEE QUALITIES IN YOU.

33:33.567 --> 33:35.900
AND I TOLD HER THAT.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.133
COME A LITTLE CLOSER, NEIL.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.133
THAT--THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:38.133 --> 33:39.900
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

33:38.133 --> 33:39.900
NO, THAT'S GREAT--NO, THAT'S

33:39.900 --> 33:42.133
STOP--OVER THE LINE.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.133
THAT'S GREAT.

33:42.133 --> 33:44.100
STOP IT.

33:42.133 --> 33:44.100
[laughing]

33:44.100 --> 33:46.433
IS THIS--

33:44.100 --> 33:46.433
STOP. STOP.

33:46.433 --> 33:48.467
IF YOU PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME,

33:46.433 --> 33:48.467
YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU

33:48.467 --> 33:52.300
REALLY MEAN IT...AND YOU REALLY

33:48.467 --> 33:52.300
WANT TO MAKE AMENDS.

33:52.300 --> 33:55.433
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE

33:52.300 --> 33:55.433
AMENDS, I CAN DEAL WITH IT.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.467
OKAY.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.467
OKAY? I'M WILLING TO...

33:58.467 --> 34:01.800
OPEN MYSELF UP TO YOU IF YOU'RE

33:58.467 --> 34:01.800
WILLING TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO

34:01.800 --> 34:04.100
ME.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.100
ALL RIGHT.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.500
DO YOU WANT TO SHAKE HANDS?

34:04.100 --> 34:06.500
YES.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.400
WHEN I ACCEPTED HIS APOLOGY,

34:06.500 --> 34:09.400
WHEN I APOLOGIZED TO HIM, DID I

34:09.400 --> 34:11.167
MEAN IT?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.167
ABSOLUTELY.

34:11.167 --> 34:12.199
THE ONE THING I WILL SAY FOR

34:13.132 --> 34:18.667
ANYTHING TO HURT A DOG, AND

34:14.132 --> 34:18.667
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

34:20.967 --> 34:24.533
I AM EXHAUSTED.

34:20.967 --> 34:24.533
AFTER ANDREW MADE UP WITH

34:24.533 --> 34:27.933
NEIL, WE WENT INTO THE TRAINING

34:24.533 --> 34:27.933
FACILITY AND HE HAD WHAT I WOULD

34:27.933 --> 34:31.266
CALL A HUMAN MOMENT, ONE THAT HE

34:27.933 --> 34:31.266
DOESN'T HAVE VERY OFTEN, WHERE

34:31.266 --> 34:34.132
HE WAS REFLECTIVE AND HE

34:31.266 --> 34:34.132
REALIZED THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

34:34.132 --> 34:36.266
THAT HE HAS CAUSED TO OTHER

34:34.132 --> 34:36.266
PEOPLE.

34:36.266 --> 34:38.699
AFTER LA DOGWORKS OPENED, SO

34:36.266 --> 34:38.699
MANY PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND

34:38.699 --> 34:43.833
SAID, "YOU DID IT."

34:38.699 --> 34:43.833
WHEW.

34:43.833 --> 34:50.266
FEEL PROUD, RIGHT?

34:43.833 --> 34:50.266
IT'S A PROUD MOMENT.

34:50.266 --> 34:55.067
I HONESTLY FELT PEOPLE WORKED

34:50.266 --> 34:55.067
REALLY HARD.

34:55.067 --> 34:58.533
EVERYBODY PITCHED IN,

34:55.067 --> 34:58.533
EVERYBODY...PULLED THEIR WEIGHT.

34:58.533 --> 35:01.500
I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY A

34:58.533 --> 35:01.500
BEAUTIFUL THING.

35:01.500 --> 35:07.300
SOMEWHERE...THINGS FELL APART

35:01.500 --> 35:07.300
AFTER THAT.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.600
WHO ARE THE EMPLOYEES, IF YOU

35:07.300 --> 35:09.600
HAD TO GUESS, WHO ARE THE

35:09.600 --> 35:17.133
EMPLOYEES YOU THINK YOU'VE

35:10.500 --> 35:17.133
HURT THE MOST EMOTIONALLY?

35:12.633 --> 35:17.133
IN REFLECTION.

35:21.567 --> 35:25.433
I WANT YOU TO RECONCILE WITH THE

35:21.567 --> 35:25.433
PEOPLE THAT MATTER, AND SOMEHOW

35:25.433 --> 35:28.733
THAT SAME RESOLUTION THAT YOU

35:25.433 --> 35:28.733
HAD ABOUT PULLING PEOPLE

35:28.733 --> 35:32.267
TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY STRIVING

35:28.733 --> 35:32.267
FOR A COMMON GOAL--WE ARE AT

35:32.267 --> 35:36.967
THAT POINT AS WE SIT HERE RIGHT

35:32.267 --> 35:36.967
NOW--THAT THAT SAME TENACITY,

35:36.967 --> 35:40.933
THAT SAME WILL TO WIN, THAT SAME

35:36.967 --> 35:40.933
ENERGY THAT YOU USED IS WHAT HAS

35:40.933 --> 35:48.267
TO HAPPEN RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

35:42.600 --> 35:48.267
YOU HAVE TO.

35:44.700 --> 35:48.267
ABSOLUTELY.

35:57.267 --> 35:59.833
THAT'S MY DOG.

35:57.267 --> 35:59.833
OH, MY BOY.

35:59.833 --> 36:02.567
BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED WITH

35:59.833 --> 36:02.567
DR. RIVERA AND HIS BREAKTHROUGH

36:02.567 --> 36:06.433
WITH NEIL, I'M NOW WATCHING HIM

36:02.567 --> 36:06.433
ACTUALLY PITCH IN.

36:06.433 --> 36:09.733
I THINK HE REALIZES THAT IF HE

36:06.433 --> 36:09.733
DOES THE JOB OF THE REST OF HIS

36:09.733 --> 36:14.067
EMPLOYEES, HE'LL HAVE A BETTER

36:09.733 --> 36:14.067
APPRECIATION, A HIGHER LEVEL OF

36:14.067 --> 36:16.300
RESPECT, AND A BETTER

36:14.067 --> 36:16.300
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT TAKES

36:16.300 --> 36:19.267
TO WORK HERE.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.267
FELICIA'S WATER.

36:19.267 --> 36:21.000
FELICIA'S WATER?

36:19.267 --> 36:21.000
YEAH.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.667
[dogs barking]

36:21.000 --> 36:25.667
YAMMA COMING IN.

36:25.667 --> 36:30.733
GO ON.

36:25.667 --> 36:30.733
NOW THAT THINGS ARE STARTING

36:30.733 --> 36:33.667
TO LOOK UP AND I'M NOTICING A

36:30.733 --> 36:33.667
CHANGE IN ANDREW'S ATTITUDE,

36:33.667 --> 36:36.500
I WANTED TO TAKE HIM OUT FRONT

36:33.667 --> 36:36.500
AND SHOW HIM SOME OF THE CHANGES

36:36.500 --> 36:38.533
THAT I'VE MADE TO THE FRONT OF

36:36.500 --> 36:38.533
THE STORE.

36:38.533 --> 36:42.500
THE BUILDING HAS BEEN REPAINTED.

36:38.533 --> 36:42.500
PATCHED, AND WE ADDED THESE

36:42.500 --> 36:40.300
THINGS.

36:42.500 --> 36:40.300
IT SAYS GROOMING...

36:40.300 --> 36:45.567
WE HAD A LOT OF THE HOLES

36:40.300 --> 36:45.567
GROOMING AND TRAINING.

36:45.567 --> 36:48.200
LOOKS VERY NICE.

36:45.567 --> 36:48.200
WE NEEDED TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT

36:48.200 --> 36:50.900
WE DO.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.900
THE LIGHTING'S ALL WORKING.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.200
THE FLAGS ARE ALL UP, AND IT

36:50.900 --> 36:53.200
LOOKS GOOD.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.733
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.733
DID YOU SEE THE LOGO INSIDE?

36:55.733 --> 37:01.500
LET ME SHOW YOU THAT.

36:55.733 --> 37:01.500
THIS LOGO THAT WAS MADE CAME OUT

37:01.500 --> 37:03.867
GREAT.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.867
I LOVE IT.

37:03.867 --> 37:06.000
IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

37:03.867 --> 37:06.000
THAT'S GREAT.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.567
I THINK THAT IS A SPECTACULAR

37:06.000 --> 37:09.567
LOGO TO BE ON THE BUSINESS CARDS

37:09.567 --> 37:12.533
WITH THE GROOMING DEPARTMENT.

37:09.567 --> 37:12.533
I MEAN, IT'S FANTASTIC.

37:12.533 --> 37:15.367
BEAUTIFUL.

37:12.533 --> 37:15.367
I ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE LABEL

37:15.367 --> 37:18.300
PRODUCTS MARKED UP SO ANDREW AND

37:15.367 --> 37:18.300
THE TEAM CAN SEE THE KIND OF

37:18.300 --> 37:21.333
IDEAS THAT WE HAVE AND THE KIND

37:18.300 --> 37:21.333
OF PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO

37:21.333 --> 37:23.333
MARKET.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.333
WHEN WE FIRST MET, I TALKED

37:23.333 --> 37:25.967
ABOUT WAYS TO KIND OF MAKE THE

37:23.333 --> 37:25.967
BRAND BIGGER AND STRONGER.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.600
THESE ARE NOTHING MORE THAN

37:25.967 --> 37:28.600
MOCKUPS.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.400
BUT I'M LOOKING FOR PRODUCTS

37:28.600 --> 37:31.400
THAT ARE APPROVED, THAT HAVE THE

37:31.400 --> 37:34.867
LA DOGWORKS STAMP OF APPROVAL.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.867
SO THE FIRST THING I HAD

37:34.867 --> 37:38.033
CREATED...

37:34.867 --> 37:38.033
IS A NEW PET FENCE.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.067
THIS IS MORE OF A MASS MARKETED

37:38.033 --> 37:40.067
PRODUCT.

37:40.067 --> 37:41.967
YOU LIKE THAT?

37:40.067 --> 37:41.967
YES.

37:41.967 --> 37:44.067
IT'S PRETTY NICE.

37:41.967 --> 37:44.067
IT'S A VERY USEFUL TOOL.

37:44.067 --> 37:46.567
IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR TRAINING

37:44.067 --> 37:46.567
DOGS.

37:46.567 --> 37:49.600
THIS IS A FOLDABLE PET BED.

37:46.567 --> 37:49.600
IT'S A COT, IT'S A DOG COT.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
YEAH.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
I LIKE THAT.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.767
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.767
THAT'S GREAT FOR THE SUMMER.

37:53.767 --> 37:56.200
A LITTLE PORTABLE PET

37:53.767 --> 37:56.200
DRINKER.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.700
SO WHETHER IT'S THIS OR 20 OTHER

37:56.200 --> 37:59.700
THINGS OR 30 OTHER THINGS, AS

37:59.700 --> 38:03.267

37:59.700 --> 38:03.267

38:03.267 --> 38:06.233
PRODUCTS WILL BE SOLD THERE.

38:03.267 --> 38:06.233
AND IT'LL ALSO BE ONLINE.

38:06.233 --> 38:09.000
HERE, COME HERE.

38:06.233 --> 38:09.000
SEE, THE BEAUTY OF THIS

38:09.000 --> 38:13.100
RELATIONSHIP IS BEING ABLE TO

38:09.000 --> 38:13.100
COLLABORATE AND MAKE STUFF LIKE

38:13.100 --> 38:16.833
MARKET.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.833
THAT'S WHAT I THINK'S GREAT.

38:16.833 --> 38:18.767
COMING UP...

38:16.833 --> 38:18.767
I CAN MAKE THIS BUSINESS WORK

38:18.767 --> 38:20.633
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.633
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT

38:20.633 --> 38:11.867
PEOPLE.

38:20.633 --> 38:11.867
OH, YEAH, I DO.

38:11.867 --> 38:23.367
THIS AND TAKE IT TO THE MASS

38:11.867 --> 38:23.367
NO.

38:23.367 --> 38:28.567
OH, YEAH, I DO!

38:23.367 --> 38:28.567
OH, YEAH, I DO!

38:28.567 --> 38:31.000
LOOK, IN THE LAST WEEK, WE'VE

38:28.567 --> 38:31.000
DONE SOME THINGS--AT LEAST WE'VE

38:31.000 --> 38:33.067
TRIED TO.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.067
WE'VE PAINTED THE FRONT OF THE

38:33.067 --> 38:23.367
STORE, WE'VE RE-BRANDED THE

38:33.067 --> 38:23.367
RETAIL STORE, WE'VE WORKED ON

38:23.367 --> 38:37.767
OH, YEAH, I DO!

38:23.367 --> 38:37.767
WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY

38:37.767 --> 38:40.433
OF THE GROOMING DEPARTMENT.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.433
LOOK, WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE

38:40.433 --> 38:43.000
ANDREW NEEDS TO GET VERY FOCUSED

38:40.433 --> 38:43.000
IF HIS BUSINESS WANTS TO

38:43.000 --> 38:45.433
SURVIVE.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.433
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED

38:45.433 --> 38:47.900
TO DO IS TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE

38:45.433 --> 38:47.900
BOARDING.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.800
I HAD AN IDEA THAT MAY OR MAY

38:47.900 --> 38:50.800
NOT WORK, BUT IF WE WENT TO

38:50.800 --> 38:54.067
ANIMAL SHELTERS IN THE GREATER

38:50.800 --> 38:54.067
LOS ANGELES AREA AND WE SAID

38:54.067 --> 38:57.967
FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY

38:54.067 --> 38:57.967
THAT ADOPTS A PET, YOUR FIRST

38:57.967 --> 39:02.100
GROOMING OR YOUR FIRST TRAINING

38:57.967 --> 39:02.100
OR YOUR FIRST BOARDING IS

39:02.100 --> 39:04.433
COMPLIMENTARY.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.433
THAT'S OUR GIFT BACK TO YOU FOR

39:04.433 --> 39:07.900
LOVING DOGS AS MUCH AS WE DO.

39:04.433 --> 39:07.900
ALTHOUGH IT'S A GREAT THING TO

39:07.900 --> 39:10.667
DO FOR THE COMMUNITY, IT'S ALSO

39:07.900 --> 39:10.667
A GREAT WAY FOR PEOPLE TO COME

39:10.667 --> 39:13.033
IN.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.033
I WOULD CALL IT A LOSS LEADER.

39:13.033 --> 39:16.300
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

39:13.033 --> 39:16.300
YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

39:16.300 --> 39:18.533
DISCUSSED BEFORE.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.533
BUT IT DIDN'T--

39:18.533 --> 39:19.667
IT'S ALL BEEN PLANNED BEFORE,

39:18.533 --> 39:19.667
RIGHT, BUT THIS HAS ALL BEEN

39:19.667 --> 39:22.600
AND IT WAS ATTEMPTED...

39:19.667 --> 39:22.600
FOLLOW-THROUGH.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.100
I CAN'T ASK SOMEBODY 10 TIMES,

39:22.600 --> 39:26.100
20 TIMES TO DO SOMETHING WHEN

39:26.100 --> 39:30.167
PEOPLE AREN'T FOLLOWING THROUGH.

39:26.100 --> 39:30.167
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.400
THERE ARE EMPLOYEES THAT WORK

39:30.167 --> 39:33.400
HERE, OKAY, AND A LOT OF THEM

39:33.400 --> 39:37.267
AREN'T MEETING THE MARK.

39:33.400 --> 39:37.267
OKAY. I DON'T GET IT.

39:37.267 --> 39:41.433
LOOK, I SEE GREAT POSSIBILITIES

39:37.267 --> 39:41.433
WITH THIS BRAND AND THIS

39:41.433 --> 39:44.967
BUSINESS, BUT ANDREW CAN'T GET

39:41.433 --> 39:44.967
PAST BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE FOR

39:44.967 --> 39:46.900
EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE THAT'S

39:44.967 --> 39:46.900
MADE.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.767
THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO GO

39:46.900 --> 39:50.767
NEED TO GO.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.600
THE PROBLEMS NEED TO GO.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.600
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

39:53.600 --> 39:49.833
I'M JUST LISTENING FOR RIGHT

39:53.600 --> 39:49.833
NOW.

39:49.833 --> 39:56.500
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUSING

39:49.833 --> 39:56.500
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY AT THIS

39:56.500 --> 39:58.900
POINT.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.900
IF I HAVE TO COME UP WITH

39:58.900 --> 40:02.800
NEW--NEW RULES EVERY DAY TO GET

39:58.900 --> 40:02.800
PEOPLE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY,

40:02.800 --> 40:05.033
THAT'S WRONG.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.033
NO, IT'S CALLED THE EVOLUTION

40:05.033 --> 40:07.000
OF BUSINESS.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.000
THINGS CHANGE.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.667
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.667
SO YOUR SOLUTION IS TO GET

40:09.667 --> 40:11.633
RID OF ALL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE

40:09.667 --> 40:11.633
THEY ALL SUCK.

40:11.633 --> 40:13.600
WHAT PEOPLE?

40:11.633 --> 40:13.600
THE STAFF?

40:13.600 --> 40:18.667
US PEOPLE.

40:13.600 --> 40:18.667
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

40:18.667 --> 40:21.300
I'M NOT A MORON.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.300
AND I CAN MAKE THIS BUSINESS

40:21.300 --> 40:24.500
WORK WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

40:21.300 --> 40:24.500
THIS ISN'T GOOD SAM, THIS ISN'T

40:24.500 --> 40:27.267
CAMPING WORLD, THIS ISN'T--

40:24.500 --> 40:27.267
YOU KNOW WHY IT'S NOT?

40:27.267 --> 40:29.433
IF THIS WAS GOOD SAM AND CAMPING

40:27.267 --> 40:29.433
WORLD, YOUR [bleep] WOULD BE

40:29.433 --> 40:32.567
OUTTA HERE.

40:29.433 --> 40:32.567
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME FINISH--

40:32.567 --> 40:34.600
DON'T BRING UP MY BUSINESS

40:32.567 --> 40:34.600
EVER--

40:34.600 --> 40:36.267
I'LL BRING WHATEVER I WANT

40:34.600 --> 40:36.267
TO.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.367
I TREAT MY PEOPLE THE RIGHT

40:36.267 --> 40:38.367
WAY--YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO

40:38.367 --> 40:40.233
TREAT PEOPLE.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.233
OH, YEAH, I DO.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.200
NO.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.200
OKAY, I HAVE CHANGED.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.167
OH, MY GOD.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.167
OKAY, I HAVE CHANGED.

40:44.167 --> 40:46.267
I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND I

40:44.167 --> 40:46.267
KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO SEE HAPPEN

40:46.267 --> 40:48.267
HERE IN ORDER FOR LA DOGWORKS

40:46.267 --> 40:48.267
TO--

40:48.267 --> 40:50.200
OH, MY GOD, YOU DON'T THOUGH,

40:48.267 --> 40:50.200
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT, OVER AND

40:50.200 --> 40:52.067
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.067
ALL I'VE HEARD FOR THE LAST YEAR

40:52.067 --> 40:54.133
IS ABOUT GETTING RID OF THIS,

40:52.067 --> 40:54.133
THAT, AND THE OTHER, ANDREW, AND

40:54.133 --> 40:56.400
YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT.

40:54.133 --> 40:56.400
I'M SORRY, YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT,

40:56.400 --> 40:58.967
AND YOU LAMBASTE A LOT OF

40:56.400 --> 40:58.967
HARDWORKING PEOPLE WHO COME IN

40:58.967 --> 41:01.300
HERE AND THEY WORK THEIR [bleep]

40:58.967 --> 41:01.300
OFF.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
WHO WORK HERE.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.533
EVERYBODY ENSURES THE SAFETY AND

41:03.100 --> 41:05.533
WELL BEING OF THESE DOGS EVERY

41:05.533 --> 41:07.333
DAY.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.333
THAT'S BULL[bleep].

41:07.333 --> 41:09.233
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF GREAT

41:07.333 --> 41:09.233
STAFF WHO'VE COME THROUGH HERE,

41:09.233 --> 41:11.633
AND A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE WHO'VE

41:09.233 --> 41:11.633
LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU.

41:11.633 --> 41:13.867
BECAUSE OF ME?

41:11.633 --> 41:13.867
BECAUSE OF YOU.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.300
NOT TRUE.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.300
NOBODY'S LEFT FOR THAT REASON.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.967
YOU ARE SO FULL OF [bleep]!

41:16.300 --> 41:18.967
I'M SORRY. NO.

41:18.967 --> 41:20.933
YOU ARE IN SUCH DENIAL.

41:18.967 --> 41:20.933
NO, I'M NOT.

41:20.933 --> 41:23.600
YOU ARE IN DENIAL, MY FRIEND!

41:20.933 --> 41:23.600
NO. YOU ARE.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.967
ABSOLUTE BULL[bleep.]

41:23.600 --> 41:27.967
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST NOT IN THE

41:27.967 --> 41:34.333
MOOD TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

41:27.967 --> 41:34.333
YOU WITH ME?

41:34.333 --> 41:38.300
ARE YOU WITH ME?

41:34.333 --> 41:38.300
[dog barks]

41:38.300 --> 41:45.267
ARE YOU WITH ME?

41:41.000 --> 41:45.267
THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.267
OKAY.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.667
I HAD A PARTNER MANY YEARS AGO.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.667
THE ONLY REASON MY PARTNER IS

41:55.667 --> 41:59.400
ALIVE IS BECAUSE MURDER IS

41:55.667 --> 41:59.400
ILLEGAL.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.700
OKAY?

41:59.400 --> 42:02.700
SO...I DON'T DO WELL WITH

42:02.700 --> 42:04.933
PARTNERS.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.933
I DON'T THINK I'M A BAD PERSON.

42:04.933 --> 42:07.100
I DON'T THINK I'M A BAD BOSS.

42:04.933 --> 42:07.100
I JUST--I HAVE ANIMALS, YOU

42:07.100 --> 42:09.500
KNOW?

42:07.100 --> 42:09.500
IT'S NOT LIKE I OWN SOME [bleep]

42:09.500 --> 42:12.067
CAMPING WORLD...

42:09.500 --> 42:12.067
YOU KNOW, CAMPING STORE WHERE

42:12.067 --> 42:14.100
SOMEBODY PUTS THE TENTS WHERE

42:12.067 --> 42:14.100
THE SKIS ARE.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.233
NOBODY'S GONNA DIE, NOBODY'S

42:14.100 --> 42:16.233
GONNA GET SICK, AND NOBODY'S

42:16.233 --> 42:19.900
GONNA GET HURT.

42:16.233 --> 42:19.900
SO...IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.900
ANYWAY.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.900
WE'RE ON CAMERA RIGHT NOW.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.933
I JUST NOTICED.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.933
THIS LEVEL OF

42:25.933 --> 42:29.733
UNPREDICTABILITY IS TOO SCARY.

42:25.933 --> 42:29.733
I CAN'T MOVE FORWARD AND DO

42:29.733 --> 42:34.200
BUSINESS WITH SOMEBODY THAT

42:29.733 --> 42:34.200
CANNOT TREAT HIS PEOPLE RIGHT.
