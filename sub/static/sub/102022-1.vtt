00:37.814 --> 00:42.450
Many moons ago on
the distant planet of Gigax,

00:42.484 --> 00:45.520
a nameless evil
reigned supreme.

00:45.554 --> 00:48.925
This ruthless being
had amassed power beyond measure

00:48.958 --> 00:51.693
and was preparing to strike down
all that was good

00:51.726 --> 00:54.096
and just in the universe.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.933
Before he could fulfill
his dark destiny,

00:56.966 --> 01:00.402
the forces of light
banded together,

01:00.435 --> 01:02.671
and in their most desperate hour

01:02.704 --> 01:04.773
toppled the dark one
from his throne.

01:04.807 --> 01:08.476
He was imprisoned in a place
far beyond reach,

01:08.510 --> 01:10.813
for if he were ever
to be released,

01:10.847 --> 01:15.717
it would spell certain doom
for all existence.

01:22.158 --> 01:26.095
Okay, here's the deal, men.
Winner is champion of

01:26.128 --> 01:29.131
the universe,
loser gets buried alive.

01:29.165 --> 01:31.399
Got it?

01:31.433 --> 01:32.701
That's fair.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.837
- Ready?
- Set?

01:34.871 --> 01:36.538
- Crazy Ball!
- Crazy Ball!

01:40.843 --> 01:42.778
You're toast, Mimi.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.848
Not even close, you dork!

01:47.682 --> 01:48.918
Ow, my butt!

01:48.951 --> 01:51.519
Yes, five point butt bonus.

01:51.553 --> 01:53.189
Swing ball.

01:53.222 --> 01:54.522
One...

01:54.556 --> 01:55.657
Crazy ball.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.193
- Two...
- Crazy ball.

01:57.226 --> 01:59.661
- Three.
- Three of a kind!

01:59.694 --> 02:02.198
Four, alright,
four points for me.

02:02.231 --> 02:04.466
I'll get you at
the switcheroo, crumb scum.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.135
Just you watch.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.770
Buckle up for a dirt sandwich,
you little maniac.

02:08.804 --> 02:10.206
Aaaah!

02:18.713 --> 02:22.184
Switcheroo. Aaah!

02:22.218 --> 02:23.718
I win!

02:23.752 --> 02:26.554
Start digging, Luke.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.627
Damn switcheroo.

02:32.661 --> 02:34.931
Keep digging, boy.

02:34.964 --> 02:39.101
Hey, hurry up so I can bury you
and go to sleep already.

02:39.135 --> 02:41.536
I'm gonna bring your bed
into my room

02:41.569 --> 02:44.673
and make one of those,
oh, what do you call it.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.809
Oh, super beds.

02:46.842 --> 02:50.612
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

03:02.191 --> 03:04.659
Is that a coffin?

03:04.693 --> 03:06.594
Is this where
they buried Grandma?

03:06.628 --> 03:08.730
No, I don't think so.

03:08.898 --> 03:11.666
Let me see.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.506
It's really stuck in there good.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.676
Maybe if I press those,
it'll do something?

03:21.710 --> 03:26.648
No, I'm the Crazy Ball champion
so I get all the treasures.

03:26.681 --> 03:28.918
Right, of course.

03:28.951 --> 03:30.719
Let's see.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.922
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

03:32.955 --> 03:35.257
Dumb dumb chump, here we go.

03:37.559 --> 03:40.196
Wow, first try.

03:40.229 --> 03:41.696
Come to mama.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.279
Cover it up!

03:57.313 --> 04:00.116
Hurry, before mom and dad see.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.716
Shovel faster, numnuts.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.253
I'm trying.

04:13.863 --> 04:17.166
Luke, Mimi, do you kids
know what time it is?

04:17.199 --> 04:18.334
- 9:00.
- 9:00.

04:18.367 --> 04:21.337
What happens at 9:00.

04:21.370 --> 04:24.140
Get inside.
It's time for bed.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.686
Dad?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.222
You okay, sport?

04:40.256 --> 04:42.858
Is there such thing
as monsters?

04:45.861 --> 04:47.897
Well, here's the thing, Luke.

04:47.930 --> 04:51.133
In a lot of ways,
humans are the real monsters.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.802
So I'd say yes.

04:52.835 --> 04:56.671
Okay, what your genius father
is trying to say is no,

04:56.704 --> 04:59.141
there's no such thing
as monsters.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.609
What happened to your head?

05:03.946 --> 05:05.881
Somebody lost at Crazy Ball.

05:05.915 --> 05:07.615
Again?

05:07.649 --> 05:09.385
Mimi, I don't want to keep
going through this, okay?

05:09.418 --> 05:12.188
Remember what we said last time
you were playing kookie ball?

05:12.221 --> 05:14.290
It's Crazy Ball!

05:14.323 --> 05:16.826
Plus, it's not even my fault.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.727
Check the tapes. Luke sucks.

05:19.761 --> 05:21.230
It doesn't matter, okay?

05:21.263 --> 05:22.832
You need to take it easy
on your brother.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.300
He won't want to play
with you anymore.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.868
What's the deal
with monsters?

05:25.901 --> 05:29.371
Are they fake? Are they real?
All the above?

05:29.405 --> 05:32.241
Yeah, what's with all
the monster talk tonight?

05:32.274 --> 05:34.777
It's just that, if there
are monsters coming to kill us,

05:34.810 --> 05:37.712
could you make sure they...

05:37.745 --> 05:39.849
could you make sure
they kill Luke first?

05:39.882 --> 05:43.319
That's harsh.
But okay.

05:43.352 --> 05:45.955
Mimi, that's
a horrible thing to say.

05:45.988 --> 05:48.324
Why?!

05:48.357 --> 05:50.159
Dismissed.

05:50.192 --> 05:52.694
Good night, wacko.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.232
Dad!

05:59.969 --> 06:02.805
Good night.

07:13.876 --> 07:16.946
Look at this shit!
There's not a pawn shop in town

07:16.979 --> 07:19.848
that's going to want this crap!

07:19.882 --> 07:22.384
If it's all garbage,
why did that old guy put up

07:22.418 --> 07:24.386
such a fight when we busted in?

07:24.420 --> 07:27.856
I think I sprained my wrist
clocking that geezer.

07:27.890 --> 07:32.760
Look at this. Why the hell
would you even grab this?

07:32.795 --> 07:35.497
Suck my dick, asshole!
It was dark.

07:35.531 --> 07:37.533
And that's a nice frame.

07:37.566 --> 07:40.436
Not any more.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.316
What the hell did
you say, buddy?

07:59.521 --> 08:02.291
A variation
of the Ironian tongue.

08:02.324 --> 08:04.927
How primitive.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.398
Let's just get out of here!
This guy's on something.

08:09.431 --> 08:11.867
Hey, you dickless shit.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.535
We already killed
one asshole tonight.

08:13.569 --> 08:16.538
And we'll gladly do it again!

08:29.918 --> 08:32.955
Your flesh is unevolved
and weak.

08:32.988 --> 08:38.260
Perhaps in a few millennia, you
will make worthy adversaries.

08:39.928 --> 08:42.431
But not today.

09:06.355 --> 09:11.427
Hey, man, please,
I don't want to die.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.463
Then live forever.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.385
This is a really big hole.

09:36.418 --> 09:38.887
How did you even dig this?
Huh?

09:38.921 --> 09:43.025
Alright, first I want to say,
great job on the hole, son.

09:43.058 --> 09:45.194
- Thanks.
- Second I want to say,

09:45.227 --> 09:46.528
this is completely unacceptable.

09:46.562 --> 09:48.230
- Oh.
- Somebody's going to

09:48.263 --> 09:51.500
have to fill this in.

09:51.533 --> 09:54.269
Anybody.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.405
One of you even.

09:56.438 --> 09:58.440
- I vote dad.
- Me too.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.409
Yeah, me three.

10:00.442 --> 10:03.345
And if I... when I vote,
I will vote for all of

10:03.379 --> 10:06.281
- you three, as a family.
- No, no.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.583
Doesn't work that way.

10:07.616 --> 10:11.653
Alright.
So much for democracy, huh?

10:11.687 --> 10:14.423
Do the dishes, Greg.

10:14.456 --> 10:16.024
What made these?

10:16.058 --> 10:18.026
If I had to guess,
I'd say some wino

10:18.060 --> 10:19.695
was on his way home
from a bender last night.

10:19.728 --> 10:21.430
Thought he could Evel Knievel

10:21.463 --> 10:23.999
his way over this hole
and fell in.

10:24.032 --> 10:28.437
- What else could it be really?
- Maybe a raccoon.

10:28.470 --> 10:30.205
That doesn't make
any damn sense.

10:30.239 --> 10:34.443
Oh!
Oh, oh, my hand.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.311
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God, my hand.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.447
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Oh, it hurts so bad, Susan!

10:38.480 --> 10:40.382
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

10:40.416 --> 10:42.317
- Come on.
- Oh, Susan.

10:42.351 --> 10:46.255
Ow! Don't even look
at it, it hurts.

10:55.731 --> 10:58.500
Did you see the size
of those freaking claw marks?

10:58.534 --> 11:01.370
We need to tell
somebody what happened.

11:01.403 --> 11:02.638
Maybe we should
go to the police.

11:02.671 --> 11:05.307
I don't trust cops.
Not one bit.

11:05.340 --> 11:08.377
We're going to go search
ourselves tonight.

11:08.410 --> 11:09.711
That's crazy.

11:09.745 --> 11:11.647
We don't know
what was down there.

11:11.680 --> 11:15.417
What's crazy is what a stupid
wiener you can be some times.

11:15.451 --> 11:18.320
Pull up your diapers
because we're going to go find

11:18.353 --> 11:20.622
what crawled out
of your grave last night

11:20.656 --> 11:24.460
like a couple of real
American heroes.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.530
Can you dig it?!

11:28.564 --> 11:31.433
Yeah. I dig it.

11:31.467 --> 11:35.504
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Alistair.

11:35.537 --> 11:37.706
You beat Rage Master 64 yet?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.209
Yeah, man, medium difficulty.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.510
- No way.
- Hey, kiddy.

11:41.543 --> 11:44.246
You look good in your
little outfit there.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.582
Why don't you give us
a spin, hunky boy?

11:46.615 --> 11:49.351
Um, no thanks.

11:50.652 --> 11:51.788
Never mind.

11:51.821 --> 11:54.456
My math!

11:55.825 --> 11:57.759
Is your sister crazy?

12:10.606 --> 12:13.609
Mimi, look.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.345
That way.

12:20.315 --> 12:23.352
There's no way
this was a dirty wino bum.

12:23.385 --> 12:25.621
Look at how even
his footsteps are.

12:25.654 --> 12:29.525
Duh. When has dad ever
been right about anything?

12:29.558 --> 12:32.761
Yeah, good point.

12:39.735 --> 12:42.771
I'm not going in there.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.673
Here, take this.

12:44.706 --> 12:46.775
I call it the Luke killer.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.577
It will protect you.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.445
How the hell
does this work?

12:50.479 --> 12:53.348
Ow! The damn thing cut me.

12:53.382 --> 12:54.750
You're using it wrong.

12:54.784 --> 12:58.320
Don't kill her Mark.
I'm going to kill you.

12:58.353 --> 13:02.224
Mimi, wait. Oh, crap.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.415
Stop jumping at everything!

13:26.448 --> 13:27.616
You're jumping, too.

13:27.649 --> 13:30.252
I'm jumping because
you're jumping!

13:30.285 --> 13:31.788
This place is dangerous.

13:31.821 --> 13:34.891
Didn't somebody die back
when this was a shoe factory?

13:34.924 --> 13:38.594
Nobody ever died
from making shoes, Luke.

13:38.627 --> 13:40.596
That's just crazy.

13:40.629 --> 13:44.733
Besides, the most dangerous
thing in here...

13:44.766 --> 13:47.269
is me.

13:48.570 --> 13:50.739
We should get out of here.

13:50.772 --> 13:55.377
Hey, creep!
We know you're in here.

13:55.410 --> 13:58.413
Show yourself or...

13:58.447 --> 14:02.351
or I'll break you
into a pile of bones?

14:02.384 --> 14:04.686
No, that wasn't good.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.323
This is super dumb.

14:08.357 --> 14:10.525
Let's go.

14:15.664 --> 14:21.570
Is that fear I smell?
How sweet.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.509
Oh, my God.

14:27.542 --> 14:31.446
Man, that's what
this one called me.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.648
Aah!

14:32.681 --> 14:35.317
Are you also man?

14:35.350 --> 14:37.686
You are much smaller creatures.

14:37.719 --> 14:39.755
No matter.

14:39.789 --> 14:42.491
You will suffer like the rest.

14:42.524 --> 14:45.560
Know that in the sweet
release of death

14:45.594 --> 14:47.629
you'll be spared
the sight of your planet

14:47.663 --> 14:51.533
being torn to pieces,
watching as everyone

14:51.566 --> 14:54.536
you hold dear is drowned
in a sea of their own blood.

14:54.569 --> 14:56.304
Shut it!

14:56.338 --> 14:58.473
No, I am not a man.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.409
I am a wo-man.

15:00.442 --> 15:04.713
And you're going to let go of
my stupid wiener bro right now!

15:07.917 --> 15:10.519
Mimi, look.

15:18.928 --> 15:22.364
Is this yours?

15:22.397 --> 15:24.801
Speak.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.837
The gem of Praxidice.

15:27.870 --> 15:29.504
This cannot be.

15:29.538 --> 15:32.507
Believe it, buster.

15:32.541 --> 15:35.644
Stop messing around
and explain, scum.

15:43.786 --> 15:48.390
The Geminia One, whoever wields
it is able to command me

15:48.423 --> 15:50.659
for as long as it's
in their possession.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.494
But know this, child.

15:52.527 --> 15:55.297
The power you wield
will be short lived.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.768
Sure, sure. But first let's
test this baby out.

15:59.802 --> 16:01.670
Alright, Monster Mash.

16:01.703 --> 16:06.775
Pick up my bro and, uh,
spin him around a bunch.

16:07.476 --> 16:09.711
Hey, come on.

16:09.745 --> 16:11.646
Ah.

16:13.682 --> 16:14.784
It hurts.

16:14.817 --> 16:17.319
Alright, put the cry baby down.

16:19.822 --> 16:23.358
Enough! The longer we play
these childish games,

16:23.391 --> 16:26.628
the more horrifying
your deaths will be.

16:26.661 --> 16:30.565
This is but a small example
of what I am capable of.

16:30.599 --> 16:32.634
His eternal pain
will take his mind

16:32.667 --> 16:35.704
beyond the furthest
reaches of madness.

16:35.737 --> 16:39.809
Preserved in an endless
state of... no!

16:39.842 --> 16:42.845
He was my masterpiece!

16:42.879 --> 16:45.782
Oh, sorry man.

16:45.815 --> 16:48.383
Thank you.

16:48.416 --> 16:51.386
Do you have a name,
Monster Man?

16:51.419 --> 16:54.924
No name can encompass
my dark will.

16:54.957 --> 16:57.526
Though my enemies
will sometimes refer to me

16:57.559 --> 17:00.797
as the arch duke of nightmares.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.764
Well, that sucks.

17:02.799 --> 17:04.766
Never mind.
We can workshop this.

17:04.801 --> 17:08.503
Luke!

17:08.537 --> 17:10.672
- Yeah?
- I want names.

17:10.705 --> 17:13.075
They've got to be fresh,
they've got to be cool.

17:13.109 --> 17:14.643
Go.

17:14.676 --> 17:17.546
We can't name it.
He's going to kill us.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.749
Ha! You would pray
for something so simple.

17:20.783 --> 17:23.853
I will drink your
endless screams as I rip...

17:23.886 --> 17:26.923
Dinosaur-us Flex.

17:26.956 --> 17:29.624
That's not bad actually.

17:29.658 --> 17:32.594
- Rexothundrax?
- Cobrala Khan.

17:32.627 --> 17:34.596
Revenge X Bad Lord.

17:34.629 --> 17:36.531
- Heartless Creep.
- Oh, Rip Lord.

17:36.565 --> 17:41.369
How about Shadow Slammer?
Or even Merman.

17:41.403 --> 17:42.872
Nemesis Grim Night.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.807
No, too sinister.

17:44.841 --> 17:47.642
How about Dark Lord
of Wonderful Smooches?

17:47.676 --> 17:51.147
I will never accept
such a title.

17:51.180 --> 17:53.381
Stop running
and clap your hands,

17:53.415 --> 17:55.818
you know, for a while at least.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.823
How about Psycho Man?

18:00.857 --> 18:03.758
Mm, Goreman?

18:03.793 --> 18:06.428
That's it.

18:07.864 --> 18:09.598
Did I get it?

18:09.631 --> 18:11.733
No.

18:11.766 --> 18:14.871
Stop that annoying clapping!

18:14.904 --> 18:18.473
His name will be...

18:18.506 --> 18:21.443
Psycho Goreman!

18:23.445 --> 18:24.947
Or PG for short.

18:24.981 --> 18:28.416
I don't see how that's better
than Archduke of Nightmares.

18:28.450 --> 18:31.153
Psycho Goreman, that's great.

18:31.187 --> 18:34.090
It's fun, it's hip,
it's wow, and it's now.

18:34.123 --> 18:36.424
You're making
a terrible mistake,

18:36.458 --> 18:38.127
you putrid little creature.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.663
Soon I'll get the gem back,
and when I do...

18:41.696 --> 18:43.900
Nice to meet you, PG.
I'm Mimi.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.667
And I'm Luke.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.570
Aaah! I wield powers
unimaginable

18:48.603 --> 18:49.906
to your simple minds.

18:49.939 --> 18:52.674
Soon you will beg me
for mercy.

18:52.707 --> 18:55.778
But know that you will
only receive pain.

18:55.811 --> 18:57.813
Knock knock?

18:57.847 --> 19:00.216
What?

19:00.249 --> 19:01.650
Knock knock?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.518
Have you succumbed
to madness already?

19:03.551 --> 19:05.221
Just say "who's there" already.

19:05.254 --> 19:07.756
Geez, what planet are you from?

19:07.790 --> 19:10.793
Gigax.

19:10.826 --> 19:12.494
Who's there?

19:12.527 --> 19:15.764
Me. Crazy Ball champion
of the universe.

19:15.798 --> 19:19.634
And the champion says...

19:19.668 --> 19:22.470
go over there,
sit down, shut up,

19:22.504 --> 19:23.940
and wait for us
to come back in the morning.

19:23.973 --> 19:25.640
You dig?

19:25.674 --> 19:28.210
Dig what?

19:28.244 --> 19:30.212
Go!

19:39.221 --> 19:41.857
You will suffer in eternity
for this!

19:41.891 --> 19:44.193
Yeah, yeah.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.595
Bye-e-e-e-e-e!

19:59.875 --> 20:01.877
I wonder what
it's favorite shows are.

20:01.911 --> 20:05.114
Do you think it likes
grilled cheeses and tacos?

20:05.147 --> 20:06.816
We should bring him
some welcome goodies

20:06.849 --> 20:08.683
before we take him out
on the town.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.719
What do you mean
take him out on the town?

20:10.752 --> 20:12.221
I got to show him off.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.856
I'll be the coolest kid
in school.

20:13.889 --> 20:16.225
He's going to kill everybody
if we take him anywhere.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.795
No, he won't.
Not unless I tell him to.

20:19.829 --> 20:22.965
Mimi, I'm pretty good at going
along with your crazy ideas.

20:22.999 --> 20:25.868
But we need to think
about this one.

20:25.901 --> 20:29.839
Fine. I should probably teach
him some cool tricks anyways.

20:29.872 --> 20:33.209
See what kind of slick stuff
he can do.

20:37.246 --> 20:41.784
Watch out, world,
it's Mimi's time to shine.

21:01.837 --> 21:04.306
The vasiaults have analyzed
the cosmic resonance

21:04.340 --> 21:07.176
and confirmed our suspicions.

21:07.209 --> 21:09.577
The ultimate evil has awoken.

21:09.611 --> 21:11.781
How can this be possible?

21:11.814 --> 21:13.849
Who could have deciphered
the sequence

21:13.883 --> 21:16.919
that released
the gem of Praxidice?

21:16.952 --> 21:19.288
I approved
the sequence myself.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.623
Whoever solved it
must have intelligence

21:21.656 --> 21:23.926
that far surpasses our own.

21:23.959 --> 21:28.230
Which is a notion that I find
quite preposterous, I must say.

21:29.899 --> 21:32.935
- Preposterous?
- That's right.

21:32.968 --> 21:35.337
Enough!

21:35.371 --> 21:38.240
Our mistake was being merciful
to that demon

21:38.274 --> 21:41.343
instead of wiping him
from the galaxy forever.

21:41.377 --> 21:44.246
It is clear that the rules
of the Gigaxian unity accords

21:44.280 --> 21:46.182
have failed us.

21:46.215 --> 21:49.151
What do you suggest
we do, Templar Pandora?

21:53.889 --> 21:58.227
It's time to elect justice
through the Templar code.

21:58.260 --> 22:01.831
There will be no trial
for that abomination.

22:01.864 --> 22:06.634
The only verdict is for him
to die by my hand.

22:06.668 --> 22:09.238
He has single handedly
extinguished entire planets

22:09.271 --> 22:10.840
from existence.

22:10.873 --> 22:13.909
How do you expect to
defeat him on your own, hm?

22:13.943 --> 22:16.946
I do not fear him.

22:16.979 --> 22:21.917
I have faith that the gods
will watch over and protect me.

22:25.020 --> 22:29.158
Ooh, sounds like a load
of superstitious nonsense to me.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.361
What was that?

22:32.394 --> 22:34.363
- Huh?
- Huh?

22:34.396 --> 22:36.664
No, no, no.
I didn't say anything.

22:36.698 --> 22:38.968
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you, Templar.

22:39.001 --> 22:40.735
It's just, we're boys
having a laugh.

22:40.768 --> 22:42.238
And...

22:42.271 --> 22:44.874
- Just a bit of...
- Just what?

22:45.975 --> 22:48.844
I think it's an excellent plan
so why don't we just move on?

22:48.878 --> 22:50.846
Lots of things
to discuss here.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.249
Aah!

22:53.282 --> 22:56.886
Do you not believe that it is
my destiny to vanquish

22:56.919 --> 23:00.389
this darkness from the universe?

23:00.422 --> 23:04.360
I... would leave...

23:07.963 --> 23:10.866
Never forget that it was we,
the Templars,

23:10.900 --> 23:14.403
that cleansed your worlds
of the dark one's scourge.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.972
It was the will of the gods
that saved you,

23:17.006 --> 23:21.743
and they can just as easily have
you all wiped from existence.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.979
Remember this.

23:24.013 --> 23:26.448
Yes, you're very kind.

23:26.482 --> 23:29.818
What are the creatures
of this planet?

23:29.852 --> 23:32.855
Humans, your holiness.

23:32.888 --> 23:36.792
Bring me one of these
human things.

23:40.996 --> 23:44.900
- Where am I?
- Come here, my dear.

23:46.936 --> 23:48.404
Don't be afraid.

23:59.982 --> 24:02.885
He will not escape us this time.

24:02.918 --> 24:09.358
The light of heaven will always
extinguish the darkness of evil.

24:21.470 --> 24:24.940
May the gods watch over me.

24:37.987 --> 24:40.422
And the president said,

24:40.456 --> 24:42.524
"But, Mimi, every day's
your birthday."

24:42.558 --> 24:44.827
Then we started eating
the whole cake

24:44.860 --> 24:47.563
while they broadcasted
it to the whole world.

24:47.596 --> 24:49.565
And that's when I woke up.

24:49.598 --> 24:51.267
Which really sucked because

24:51.300 --> 24:54.270
I wanted to finish
that tasty cake.

24:54.303 --> 24:59.174
Okay, so who's this
guy you have got living

24:59.208 --> 25:00.876
in the old shoe factory?

25:00.909 --> 25:02.878
You're going to
love him, Alistair.

25:02.911 --> 25:07.416
He's this big scary monster
that wants to kill everybody.

25:07.449 --> 25:08.984
Huh?

25:09.018 --> 25:11.887
Hey, could one of you guys
help me with this?

25:11.920 --> 25:13.822
No, thanks.

25:22.464 --> 25:25.200
Holy crud.

25:25.234 --> 25:27.403
I know, right?

25:27.436 --> 25:30.806
PG, wake up!

25:37.613 --> 25:41.450
PG, wake up. I want you
to meet our friend, Alistair.

25:44.286 --> 25:47.489
Wait, were we supposed
to feed him?

25:49.925 --> 25:52.194
You alive, buddy?

25:57.032 --> 25:58.267
Aaah!

25:58.300 --> 26:00.602
Stop!

26:00.636 --> 26:03.906
Nice try.

26:03.939 --> 26:06.542
Anyways, Alistair,
this is Psycho Goreman.

26:06.575 --> 26:08.344
Or PG for short.

26:10.346 --> 26:12.014
- Hi.
- Silence!

26:12.047 --> 26:13.515
Okay.

26:13.549 --> 26:15.951
We've brought you
some reading material, PG.

26:15.984 --> 26:18.420
And a TV to watch.
Did you sleep okay?

26:18.454 --> 26:20.889
I'm sorry we didn't
bring any pornos.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.591
Petty displays of wealth.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.661
How can your short life spans
allow such narcissism?

26:25.694 --> 26:28.030
Yeah, but look
at all the hunky boys.

26:28.063 --> 26:31.467
I do not care for hunky boys.

26:36.438 --> 26:39.908
Or do I?

26:39.942 --> 26:42.511
PG, can I ask you something?

26:42.544 --> 26:44.012
No!

26:44.046 --> 26:46.548
PG, I don't like that attitude.

26:46.582 --> 26:50.052
Be nice, please.
Luke, ask him again.

26:50.085 --> 26:53.555
Can I ask you something?

26:53.589 --> 26:55.357
What?

26:55.391 --> 26:57.926
What are you?

27:08.737 --> 27:11.340
That is a tale bathed
in the blood

27:11.373 --> 27:13.642
of a million dead memories.

27:18.647 --> 27:24.219
I was born in a time before
time, on the planet Gigax.

27:24.253 --> 27:26.622
A world light years
from your own.

27:26.655 --> 27:29.425
My entire existence
was servitude,

27:29.458 --> 27:33.228
under the rule of beings that
claimed to serve a higher power

27:33.262 --> 27:35.330
that governed over us all.

27:35.364 --> 27:38.634
These entities,
known as the Templars,

27:38.667 --> 27:40.502
had no more divine purpose

27:40.536 --> 27:43.705
than the dirt I excavated
to help build their churches.

27:43.739 --> 27:47.309
But still they were able
to crush the people of Gigax

27:47.342 --> 27:49.711
beneath their gilded heels.

27:49.745 --> 27:52.714
The Templars preached to us
their holy scriptures,

27:52.748 --> 27:56.418
declaring their
rightful ownership of Gigax.

27:56.452 --> 27:59.455
To them, we were nothing
more than parasites

27:59.488 --> 28:01.690
trespassing on hallowed ground.

28:06.662 --> 28:08.464
That candy was weird.

28:13.368 --> 28:19.408
But then one day
every thing changed.

28:34.456 --> 28:38.327
I discovered an artifact
thought to be lost forever,

28:38.360 --> 28:42.331
forged by ancient
Gigaxian warlocks out of energy

28:42.364 --> 28:44.633
from the darkest corners
of the galaxy...

28:44.666 --> 28:47.436
the gem of Praxidice.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.722
The moment I took
the gem in my hand

29:06.755 --> 29:11.493
and felt its immense power,
my destiny was clear.

29:11.527 --> 29:14.229
I would destroy the Templars

29:14.263 --> 29:18.567
and anyone else
that stood against me.

29:48.463 --> 29:49.866
The gem bonded with me

29:49.899 --> 29:53.569
and gave me power
beyond all other beings.

29:53.602 --> 29:57.506
I was able to raise an army
led by my loyal generals,

29:57.539 --> 30:02.711
the Paladins of Sydion,
and take back Gigax.

30:02.744 --> 30:05.882
But I didn't stop there.

30:05.915 --> 30:08.717
It was clear that my thirst
for death would only be

30:08.750 --> 30:14.690
satiated if I snuffed out
all light in the universe.

30:18.393 --> 30:20.830
But I was overthrown
and imprisoned

30:20.863 --> 30:24.766
by the Templars
and their planetary alliance.

30:24.801 --> 30:29.638
They stole the gem
and, with it, my power.

30:49.892 --> 30:53.830
To this day, I do not understand
how such weak minded insects

30:53.863 --> 30:58.500
could defeat the greatest
power in the galaxy.

30:59.568 --> 31:01.403
TV's working.

31:03.505 --> 31:06.341
Well, that boring dumb story
made me tired.

31:06.375 --> 31:07.509
Let's go, guys.

31:07.542 --> 31:10.479
PG, your homework
is to watch more TV

31:10.512 --> 31:12.314
and learn how to be more fun.

31:12.347 --> 31:14.383
Otherwise...

31:14.416 --> 31:16.485
I will have to punish you.

31:16.518 --> 31:18.720
Well, it was nice meeting you.

31:18.754 --> 31:22.290
It would nicer if you were dead.

31:22.324 --> 31:23.759
Alright, bye.

31:39.775 --> 31:42.344
Energy runs through this box.

31:45.414 --> 31:48.283
It might be enough.

31:48.316 --> 31:52.287
Spirits of the electroverse,
find my world and alert

31:52.320 --> 31:56.591
the Paladins of Sydion
that their master walks again.

32:00.930 --> 32:03.331
The gem of Praxidice
has been taken

32:03.365 --> 32:05.367
by two brainless meat children.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.537
You must attain the gem
even if it has to be pried

32:08.570 --> 32:10.807
from their tiny dead hands.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.344
Thanks for
having me to stay over

32:16.378 --> 32:17.713
for dinner, Mrs. Hallenbeck.

32:17.746 --> 32:19.314
Glad to have you, Alistair.

32:19.347 --> 32:21.650
Yes, very glad to have you.

32:21.683 --> 32:23.886
Well, I was busy filling
in that hole in the backyard,

32:23.920 --> 32:25.822
so unfortunately, Mr. Hallenbeck

32:25.855 --> 32:29.324
had the pleasure
of playing master chef tonight.

32:29.357 --> 32:31.359
How great is
this chicken, Alistair?

32:31.393 --> 32:32.627
It's my special recipe.

32:32.661 --> 32:35.764
It's, uh...

32:35.798 --> 32:37.532
It's a little tough, Dad.

32:37.566 --> 32:38.868
The microwave will do that.

32:38.901 --> 32:40.837
But it sure brings
out the flavor.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.805
What did you three maniacs
get up to?

32:42.839 --> 32:45.607
We, um... Ow!

32:45.640 --> 32:47.409
We were playing
guns in the forest.

32:47.442 --> 32:49.879
Guns?
Now that sounds like fun.

32:49.912 --> 32:53.348
Back when I was in the army, we
used to play guns all the time.

32:53.381 --> 32:55.417
Except it was called
the Iraq War.

32:55.450 --> 32:58.720
We played for keeps.

32:58.754 --> 33:00.388
Meaning I killed people.

33:00.422 --> 33:02.457
Okay, don't listen to GI Joker
over here.

33:02.491 --> 33:05.862
He's never fired
a gun in his life.

33:05.895 --> 33:07.596
- Anyways...
- Can me and Alistair

33:07.629 --> 33:09.431
play video games?

33:09.464 --> 33:11.834
Mm-hmm. Just put your plates
by the sink, okay, honey?

33:11.868 --> 33:14.703
But, Alistair,
games are for nerds.

33:14.736 --> 33:16.371
Wouldn't you rather go
in the driveway

33:16.404 --> 33:19.508
and throw basketballs
at Luke or something?

33:19.541 --> 33:21.610
Oh, uh, yeah, thanks.

33:21.643 --> 33:25.580
But I just really want
to play some vids.

33:25.614 --> 33:27.516
Come on, let's go.

33:30.552 --> 33:33.355
Guess I'll play by myself then.

33:33.388 --> 33:35.323
Hey, Mimi.

33:35.357 --> 33:37.325
Can you come back
and finish your broccoli?

33:37.359 --> 33:40.762
No, I cannot, because champions
don't eat broccoli!

33:40.797 --> 33:44.100
Well, she finished
my delicious chicken.

33:44.133 --> 33:48.770
And in the end, isn't that
all that really matters?

33:48.805 --> 33:51.339
No, she didn't.

34:00.783 --> 34:03.886
And then I heard Kyle
put all his pubes in a bag

34:03.920 --> 34:06.655
and sold them to Mason
for five bucks.

34:06.688 --> 34:08.390
Isn't that crazy?

34:08.423 --> 34:11.093
Dude, what's he going to do
with a bag of pubes?

34:13.863 --> 34:16.598
What the frig are you doing?

34:16.631 --> 34:18.100
- But...
- Took you long enough.

34:18.134 --> 34:19.836
I don't have all night.

34:19.869 --> 34:23.139
Time is a false construct that
only exists for

34:23.172 --> 34:27.776
primitive beings unable to phase
into the ninth dimension.

34:27.810 --> 34:30.579
Also I got lost.

34:30.612 --> 34:34.382
Mimi, what the heck
are you doing?

34:34.416 --> 34:35.617
He can't be here.

34:35.650 --> 34:38.386
He can be wherever
I want him to be.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.621
Remember?

34:39.654 --> 34:42.091
Heads up, dumpy butt.

34:44.726 --> 34:46.528
Bulls eye!

34:46.561 --> 34:48.865
This reminds me of
an ancient torture technique

34:48.898 --> 34:52.935
I learned from the worms
of Janus many moons ago.

34:52.969 --> 34:56.138
Should I go?

34:56.172 --> 34:58.140
This is getting a little weird.

34:58.174 --> 35:01.676
Those were good people,
those worms.

35:01.710 --> 35:05.915
I don't care about
your stupid ancient techniques.

35:05.948 --> 35:09.819
Unless they can make Alistair
stop being such a freaking dork.

35:09.852 --> 35:14.489
I once used my dark magic
to help the warlord of Zatonia

35:14.522 --> 35:16.792
seduce the moon princess.

35:16.826 --> 35:20.830
I can do the same
for you if you wish.

35:21.898 --> 35:25.600
You can make him want
to chuck basketballs with me.

35:25.634 --> 35:29.771
Alright, I'm going to bounce.
Good night, everybody.

35:29.805 --> 35:31.473
Do it.

35:31.506 --> 35:34.542
So be it.

35:34.576 --> 35:37.612
Your wish is my command.

35:38.881 --> 35:41.217
Oh, Jesus!

35:41.250 --> 35:45.553
Greg, what did you do
to the microwave?

35:45.587 --> 35:48.124
Cooked a great meal
for my family, that's what.

35:48.157 --> 35:49.591
You're welcome.

35:49.624 --> 35:52.694
It's totally wrecked.

35:52.727 --> 35:55.131
You're welcome.

35:58.801 --> 36:02.737
That's great.

36:03.839 --> 36:05.841
Oh, my God.

36:06.508 --> 36:07.944
Oh, my God.

36:15.251 --> 36:18.187
What did you do to him?

36:18.220 --> 36:20.790
Get away from my kids!

36:25.593 --> 36:27.930
My lucky bat!

36:27.964 --> 36:30.166
Come on!

36:30.199 --> 36:32.969
Greg, what the hell
are you doing?

36:33.002 --> 36:34.837
Aaah!

36:34.870 --> 36:38.573
You dare stand against me with
such a weak excuse for a weapon?

36:38.606 --> 36:40.209
No, I didn't. She did. She did.

36:40.242 --> 36:41.743
You asshole!

36:41.776 --> 36:45.680
Don't hurt my parents.
That's an order.

36:45.714 --> 36:51.153
Um, Mom, dad, I want you to meet
my new best pal,

36:51.187 --> 36:54.156
Psycho Goreman,
or PG for short.

36:54.190 --> 36:57.793
I don't care what his name is,
you need to call the police.

36:57.827 --> 36:59.295
Are you kidding me?

36:59.328 --> 37:01.696
What's a cop going to do
against this thing?

37:01.730 --> 37:03.966
- Is he going to kill us?
- No way.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.901
PG's a big softy.

37:05.935 --> 37:09.905
He wouldn't hurt anybody.
Right, buddy?

37:10.739 --> 37:13.976
My entire existence is built
on death and destruction.

37:14.010 --> 37:16.245
I will kill you both.

37:16.278 --> 37:18.747
No, no, no, no.
No, you won't.

37:18.781 --> 37:22.918
PG's just being a goof.
He's family now. Don't worry.

37:22.952 --> 37:24.619
Be worried.

37:24.652 --> 37:26.755
When I'm free of
your daughter's control,

37:26.789 --> 37:28.924
I will bath in your blood.

37:28.958 --> 37:32.694
Ha!
PG, you're such a whack job!

37:36.866 --> 37:39.601
I will kill you.

37:39.634 --> 37:42.204
I will kill you.

37:42.238 --> 37:45.174
I will kill you.

39:41.924 --> 39:45.227
What the fuck, man?

39:45.261 --> 39:47.796
So tomorrow
we've got a tight schedule.

39:47.830 --> 39:50.466
We're bowling at 10:00,
and then a light picnic brunch,

39:50.499 --> 39:52.168
which we'll have to have
around noon

39:52.201 --> 39:54.303
so that Mom can take us
to the grocery store.

39:54.336 --> 39:56.438
I've set aside
four hours for baking

39:56.472 --> 40:01.443
so hopefully that's enough time
to bake all 12 cakes.

40:14.756 --> 40:16.158
Wow.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.328
I wish my face could do that.

40:19.361 --> 40:21.163
What do you eat
back at home, PG?

40:21.197 --> 40:24.934
Food is not only for
sustenance back on Gigax.

40:24.967 --> 40:27.002
It's part of an honor code.

40:27.036 --> 40:31.941
To be eaten is considered
a warriors death.

40:31.974 --> 40:37.246
I remember during the battle
on the Bridge of Souls.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.916
I've got it.
Here's the new plan.

40:40.950 --> 40:43.319
Six hours for baking,

40:43.352 --> 40:47.356
and we push upside down karaoke
to Sunday.

40:47.389 --> 40:48.924
Boom!

40:48.958 --> 40:51.794
Does that...
Of course it does.

40:51.827 --> 40:56.398
Case closed. Judge Mimi will
return after these messages.

40:59.335 --> 41:01.470
Don't mind if I do.

41:01.503 --> 41:03.806
I was going to eat those.

41:06.242 --> 41:08.177
I think you've
had enough, fatso.

41:08.210 --> 41:10.546
Champion's got to eat.

41:10.579 --> 41:12.915
So good.

42:07.336 --> 42:11.206
Hello, boy.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.908
What is happening right now?

42:12.941 --> 42:14.910
You have crossed
the dream barrier

42:14.943 --> 42:17.946
and are traversing
the nightmare realm.

42:17.980 --> 42:23.018
It is here where I am able to
communicate with your privately.

42:23.052 --> 42:26.522
Hidden in your dark thoughts.

42:26.555 --> 42:29.024
What do you want?

42:29.058 --> 42:31.927
You know what I want.

42:34.063 --> 42:35.364
The gem.

42:35.397 --> 42:38.567
This sick game
must come to an end.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.603
Get it for me
so that I can be free.

42:41.637 --> 42:43.505
I can't do that.

42:43.539 --> 42:45.474
Mimi found the gem.

42:45.507 --> 42:47.409
It belongs to her now.

42:47.443 --> 42:49.978
Finders keepers, that's the law.

42:50.012 --> 42:53.282
How long before others
learn of my awakening

42:53.315 --> 42:56.652
and invade this quiet
little planet of yours?

42:56.685 --> 43:00.656
Sooner or later,
the gem will be mine.

43:00.689 --> 43:06.195
Help me now, and I might
consider sparing your life.

43:06.695 --> 43:08.430
I can't betray
my sister like that.

43:08.464 --> 43:13.268
Do you think she would
grant you the same courtesy?

43:13.302 --> 43:14.303
No.

43:14.336 --> 43:17.339
I see the way she treats you.

43:17.373 --> 43:20.576
These small torments
are just the beginning.

43:20.609 --> 43:25.447
How long before
she puts her life before yours?

43:25.481 --> 43:29.918
She would never do that.

43:29.952 --> 43:32.921
I think.

43:32.955 --> 43:36.358
You know this is the only way.

43:36.392 --> 43:41.397
Give me the gem so we can
both be free of her madness.

43:42.598 --> 43:46.301
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can do it.

43:46.335 --> 43:48.370
It will lead to bad things
if I help you.

43:48.404 --> 43:50.506
Fine!

43:52.374 --> 43:55.344
You are stronger than I thought.

43:55.377 --> 43:58.714
But also incredibly stupid.

43:58.747 --> 44:03.252
So... what happens now?

44:03.285 --> 44:06.688
We wait for this dream
of yours to conclude.

44:12.094 --> 44:13.629
Okay.

44:20.269 --> 44:25.474
Alright, cats, what I'm about to
teach you today is confidential.

44:25.507 --> 44:30.245
The government can not,
under any circumstances,

44:30.279 --> 44:32.281
find out about this game.

44:32.314 --> 44:34.316
Got it?

44:34.349 --> 44:36.251
Okay, so there's two teams.

44:36.285 --> 44:38.287
Each team starts by throwing
their balls as far away...

44:38.320 --> 44:40.422
So you got to run and get
the other teams balls in...

44:40.456 --> 44:42.691
Chuck them at your opponents,
the other player throws their

44:42.724 --> 44:45.060
- ball as high as they can...
- And then spin around like this.

44:45.093 --> 44:46.528
Each Jumping Jack
gives you a point.

44:46.562 --> 44:48.297
Then whoever gets hit
has to take the ball.

44:48.330 --> 44:50.265
But only while the opposing
player is doing...

44:50.299 --> 44:53.368
But there is a special
move called the switcheroo.

44:53.402 --> 44:56.472
Which happens when
two balls collide in mid air.

44:56.505 --> 44:59.608
And when that happens, whoever
punches their opponent first

44:59.641 --> 45:04.279
gets all of the other
team's points plus one.

45:04.313 --> 45:08.016
Okay, the game ends
when you reach 67 points.

45:10.719 --> 45:14.256
I have no idea what's going on.
Do you?

45:22.631 --> 45:24.233
Oh, no.

45:24.266 --> 45:26.301
Get away from the kids!

45:26.335 --> 45:27.503
Right now!

45:27.536 --> 45:29.371
What the hell is that thing?

45:29.404 --> 45:33.642
- Just remember your training.
- There's no time. Shoot him!

45:39.348 --> 45:41.750
I should have let those hit you.

45:44.353 --> 45:47.389
Hurry up, PG.
We don't have all day.

45:50.359 --> 45:54.229
You are protectors
of this realm?

45:54.263 --> 45:57.633
I was expecting something
a bit more impressive.

45:57.666 --> 45:59.836
Who are you?

45:59.869 --> 46:02.271
Who am I?

46:02.304 --> 46:05.474
Let me show you, law dealer.

46:18.855 --> 46:21.723
Ahh.

46:21.757 --> 46:25.227
I am your master now.

46:29.765 --> 46:32.601
Tell your people
darkness has fallen.

46:32.634 --> 46:35.337
Resist the eclipse
of my power again

46:35.370 --> 46:36.839
and I will not
show you the mercy

46:36.873 --> 46:39.608
I've shown your friend.

46:39.641 --> 46:42.277
Run.

46:45.848 --> 46:47.683
Vince, give me the key!

47:02.899 --> 47:07.436
Here, another contestant
for your game of nonsense.

47:09.771 --> 47:13.475
PG, now I have to
start all over again.

47:13.508 --> 47:15.377
Okay, so there's two teams.

47:15.410 --> 47:16.879
Each team starts by
throwing their ball

47:16.913 --> 47:20.549
as far away from
the other team as possible.

47:20.582 --> 47:22.284
Do you get it?

47:24.519 --> 47:26.688
See, he gets it.

47:26.722 --> 47:29.892
Glad one of you
monster boys understands.

47:29.926 --> 47:31.693
That soulless husk
is just telling you

47:31.727 --> 47:33.729
what you want to hear.

47:33.762 --> 47:36.632
Whatever, you're dumb, I get it.

47:36.665 --> 47:38.300
Let's play.

47:41.703 --> 47:44.573
Oh, I get Alistair's
done for the day.

47:44.606 --> 47:46.441
Bye, Alistair.

47:46.475 --> 47:50.813
I'll be right back, you morons.
Don't move.

47:50.847 --> 47:52.748
Are you okay, buddy?

47:52.782 --> 47:55.717
Yeah, it's just...

47:55.751 --> 47:57.452
What?

47:57.486 --> 48:01.490
Do you think
I'll ever be normal again?

48:01.523 --> 48:05.327
Probably not.
But who cares?

48:05.360 --> 48:07.663
I like you just
the way you are.

48:09.331 --> 48:12.334
Oh, okay.

48:12.367 --> 48:16.672
Bye, Alistair!
You beautiful blob.

48:19.675 --> 48:22.511
So the "F" word works
in a lot of different ways.

48:22.544 --> 48:26.748
If you stub your toe, you can be
like, "Ow, my frigging toe!"

48:26.783 --> 48:28.818
Or if you see something
weird or crazy,

48:28.851 --> 48:30.820
you can be like,
"What the frig?"

48:30.853 --> 48:33.755
But the best one is when
you're telling someone off.

48:33.790 --> 48:37.726
You can be like...
you tell it to them, Luke.

48:37.759 --> 48:40.328
Frig off.

48:40.362 --> 48:42.664
Frig off.

48:43.665 --> 48:45.600
Use that on someone
you really hate.

48:53.341 --> 48:57.412
What is this?
Some kind of special card?

48:57.446 --> 48:58.680
What is this junk?!

48:58.714 --> 49:00.649
I told you guys
to write me love letters

49:00.682 --> 49:02.919
telling me how amazing I was!

49:02.952 --> 49:06.321
What a waste of beautiful card.

49:06.354 --> 49:08.623
What is love?

49:08.657 --> 49:14.429
You know, have you ever felt all
warm and fuzzy about somebody?

49:14.463 --> 49:16.465
Like when you rip out
your enemy's spine

49:16.498 --> 49:18.633
and display it
to their grieving family?

49:18.667 --> 49:22.404
No, not... no, not exactly.

49:22.437 --> 49:23.840
Love is...

49:23.873 --> 49:27.676
Love is a happy feeling
towards somebody you care about.

49:27.709 --> 49:30.847
You feel complete.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.547
Even if you didn't think
you were missing something

49:32.581 --> 49:34.382
in the first place.

49:34.416 --> 49:38.420
All I feel is anger and hate.
I will never be whole.

49:38.453 --> 49:42.424
Don't worry about it, PG.
Love is for losers anyway.

49:42.457 --> 49:46.495
Oh, yeah? I thought you were
so in love with Alistair.

49:46.528 --> 49:47.864
That doesn't count.

49:47.897 --> 49:50.298
We're just friends
that are going to get married

49:50.332 --> 49:52.501
and be together forever.

49:52.534 --> 49:53.903
And fight a lot,
like mom and dad do.

49:53.936 --> 49:56.772
PG, I don't like the way Luke's
making fun of me.

49:56.806 --> 49:59.474
Kill him, please.

49:59.508 --> 50:01.510
No, please!

50:01.543 --> 50:04.646
Stop!

50:04.679 --> 50:06.816
Just kidding!

50:08.750 --> 50:11.921
Your face.
You're such a scaredy cat.

50:11.954 --> 50:14.824
And you're just... no!

50:14.857 --> 50:17.592
So close.

50:17.626 --> 50:18.795
That's it!

50:18.828 --> 50:21.763
Now you get to pull the wagon.

50:34.776 --> 50:36.813
Faster, you dog.

50:55.798 --> 50:58.700
Hey, buddy.
You're safe now.

51:01.703 --> 51:04.106
It was horrible.

51:04.140 --> 51:05.774
His eyes.

51:05.808 --> 51:08.845
It's like he was
looking into my soul.

51:08.878 --> 51:10.847
And Vince.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.397
Excuse me, human. I'm searching
for a nameless evil

51:29.431 --> 51:31.533
that was buried here long ago.

51:31.566 --> 51:34.669
He's awoken
and has most likely slaughtered

51:34.703 --> 51:37.505
half your people already.

51:37.539 --> 51:39.175
Have you seen him?

51:39.208 --> 51:43.779
No offense, ma'am, but that
description is a little vague.

51:43.813 --> 51:47.415
I've seen him!
That think that killed Vince!

51:47.449 --> 51:48.784
Emmett O'Brien,
didn't you listen to a thing

51:48.818 --> 51:51.519
that this poor man says?

51:51.553 --> 51:53.789
No.

51:53.823 --> 51:57.459
God, you're a dumb ass.

51:57.492 --> 52:01.864
I must find him.
Give me everything.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.950
Something's coming.

52:20.983 --> 52:23.551
What? You got to dump?

52:39.601 --> 52:43.538
Welcome back to the land
of the living, master.

52:43.571 --> 52:46.242
Spare me the theatrics,
Dark Scream.

52:46.275 --> 52:47.676
What took you so long?

52:47.709 --> 52:49.678
We came as soon
as we could, my lord.

52:49.711 --> 52:51.546
Let me be the first to say

52:51.579 --> 52:55.684
that we are all so very glad
to see that you're alive.

52:55.717 --> 53:00.488
PG, are these silly
little guys your friends?

53:00.522 --> 53:02.191
Why don't you introduce us?

53:02.224 --> 53:03.926
They don't look very friendly.

53:03.960 --> 53:09.832
Ah, yes, Paladins,
this is Mimi and...

53:12.667 --> 53:13.970
her brother.

53:14.003 --> 53:16.272
It's Luke.

53:16.305 --> 53:19.141
You should know my name by now.

53:19.175 --> 53:22.878
They are the humans
responsible for freeing me.

53:22.912 --> 53:25.881
That's right. You're welcome.

53:25.915 --> 53:28.951
Mimi has the Gem of Praxidice.

53:28.985 --> 53:32.687
Don't worry.
She doesn't know how to use it.

53:32.721 --> 53:35.724
You may kill them now.

53:45.167 --> 53:47.970
You fool.
Why would we do that?

53:48.004 --> 53:50.306
Excuse me?

53:50.339 --> 53:53.275
We like things
the way they are now.

53:57.780 --> 53:59.748
You must be joking?

53:59.782 --> 54:02.151
Far from it, master.

54:02.184 --> 54:04.286
We are quite content
with running the fifth moon

54:04.320 --> 54:07.790
of Gigax ourselves,
sharing the duties equally.

54:07.823 --> 54:09.892
We take turns
as the appointed leader

54:09.925 --> 54:11.894
so everyone
gets a fair chance.

54:11.927 --> 54:15.231
As you can see,
it is currently my turn.

54:15.264 --> 54:19.567
Let me guess, you made a deal
with those righteous idiots,

54:19.601 --> 54:20.903
the Templars.

54:20.936 --> 54:22.704
In exchange for
your imprisonment,

54:22.737 --> 54:26.308
they agreed to spare us
any further inconveniences.

54:26.342 --> 54:29.812
I put my trust in the worst
the galaxy has to offer,

54:29.845 --> 54:32.815
and this is how you repay me?

54:32.848 --> 54:35.717
I should have known better.

54:35.750 --> 54:38.788
Except for you, Cassius 3000.

54:38.821 --> 54:40.688
I always knew
I couldn't trust you.

54:40.722 --> 54:45.194
Huh, come on.
We all knew this day was coming.

54:45.227 --> 54:49.231
So why don't you lay down
and die like a good little boy?

54:49.265 --> 54:52.234
Yeah, like a good
little boy, yeah.

54:52.268 --> 54:54.303
You imbeciles.

54:54.336 --> 54:57.639
Pandora's crusade
will not stop with me.

54:57.672 --> 55:01.377
Her gaze will fall upon your
wretched hides soon enough.

55:01.410 --> 55:04.612
Your shared crown is nothing
but a symbol

55:04.646 --> 55:07.383
of your own incompetence.

55:07.416 --> 55:08.918
Then we will trade this crown

55:08.951 --> 55:11.854
for one made
from your shattered skull.

55:11.887 --> 55:13.355
Kill him!

55:13.389 --> 55:15.391
PG, you jerk!

55:15.424 --> 55:17.860
Stop right there!

55:17.893 --> 55:21.263
What? No!

55:21.297 --> 55:22.697
What are you doing?!

55:22.730 --> 55:25.901
You told them to kill me!

55:25.935 --> 55:28.804
They're going to
kill you instead.

55:28.838 --> 55:31.273
See how you like it.

55:55.297 --> 55:57.199
Ahh.

55:57.233 --> 55:59.734
How long is this
going to go on for?

55:59.767 --> 56:01.270
What do you mean?

56:03.239 --> 56:05.341
I mean, shouldn't
he apologize or something?

56:05.374 --> 56:08.377
No, it's all right. Hey, PG!

56:08.410 --> 56:10.246
- What?!
- Apologize.

56:10.279 --> 56:11.447
I'm sorry.

56:11.480 --> 56:13.249
Not good enough.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.184
Let's try this again,
but this time,

56:15.217 --> 56:17.887
you got to really mean it.

56:17.920 --> 56:20.389
A ruler never apologizes.

56:20.422 --> 56:22.958
It's a betrayal
of everything I stand for.

56:22.992 --> 56:25.760
I would die... Aah!

56:25.794 --> 56:27.729
Yes, scream for me.

56:27.762 --> 56:30.933
Fine, you don't want
to give me a real apology,

56:30.966 --> 56:32.801
that's your problem.

56:32.835 --> 56:35.471
Come on, Luke. We go.

56:35.504 --> 56:38.274
Wait!

56:38.307 --> 56:39.842
Wait.

56:39.875 --> 56:43.345
Yeah, do you have
something you'd like to say?

56:44.980 --> 56:48.384
I am truly sorry,
little creature.

56:51.954 --> 56:54.823
Great. Apology accepted.

56:54.857 --> 56:57.159
Now, was that so hard?

56:57.193 --> 56:59.761
Go get them, dude.

57:22.051 --> 57:23.385
Yes!

57:24.787 --> 57:26.388
Ha-ha!

57:44.473 --> 57:46.242
Oh, my...

58:14.303 --> 58:17.239
Taste of my magic, witch master.

58:25.281 --> 58:26.882
No way, lady.

58:26.915 --> 58:29.184
You chose this, now live
with the consequences.

58:56.312 --> 58:59.315
Please spare me.

59:09.458 --> 59:12.294
Look into the pool
and see the horror that dwells

59:12.328 --> 59:14.596
inside true darkness.

59:16.532 --> 59:20.336
Do you see?
That's where real darkness lies.

59:20.369 --> 59:22.871
Within ourselves.

59:22.905 --> 59:26.942
I... understand now.

59:26.975 --> 59:29.211
Good.

59:42.991 --> 59:46.962
Maybe in the afterlife you can
be crowned the king of fools.

59:46.995 --> 59:48.397
Gloat all you want.

59:48.430 --> 59:50.432
Soon enough the Templars
will find you.

59:50.466 --> 59:53.569
And throw you back
in your dark prison forever.

59:53.602 --> 59:57.606
Despite being a gibbering idiot,
you fought honorably.

59:57.639 --> 1:00:01.977
So I will give you
a warriors death.

1:00:02.010 --> 1:00:03.445
No, please.

1:00:25.467 --> 1:00:29.338
The horrors you've just
witnessed cannot be unseen.

1:00:29.371 --> 1:00:31.440
Your young minds
will carry this

1:00:31.473 --> 1:00:35.043
until it consumes you
in a miserable death.

1:00:35.077 --> 1:00:37.946
Cool.

1:00:37.980 --> 1:00:39.948
Can we go home now?

1:00:39.982 --> 1:00:41.583
Yes.

1:00:41.617 --> 1:00:44.219
It's time to rest.

1:00:47.489 --> 1:00:50.692
PG, what's wrong?

1:00:50.726 --> 1:00:52.327
I'm dying.

1:00:52.361 --> 1:00:53.629
- What?!
- What?!

1:00:53.662 --> 1:00:55.364
Of course.

1:00:55.397 --> 1:00:57.499
They must have saved my blood
from the battle

1:00:57.533 --> 1:01:00.335
of the zone keepers
and cursed their blades with it.

1:01:01.737 --> 1:01:04.006
Clever move, Dark Scream.

1:01:04.039 --> 1:01:06.408
We can't move him
ourselves.

1:01:06.442 --> 1:01:07.576
We need to call for help.

1:01:07.609 --> 1:01:09.344
Great idea, dingus!

1:01:09.378 --> 1:01:11.246
How are we going to do that?!

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:13.715
Well, I don't know, cowboy cat,

1:01:13.749 --> 1:01:16.985
what is the difference between
a saddle and a can of paint?

1:01:17.019 --> 1:01:21.323
- You're going to love this one.
- What is this? What is that?

1:01:21.356 --> 1:01:24.393
Oh, yeah. I bought a new TV.

1:01:24.426 --> 1:01:26.428
In other news, I'm going to take
a couple of weeks off work

1:01:26.462 --> 1:01:27.763
till my hand
can heal completely.

1:01:27.797 --> 1:01:29.731
So you might want to pick up
a few extra shifts

1:01:29.765 --> 1:01:31.500
at the pharmacy.

1:01:31.533 --> 1:01:34.236
You dumped me for this beauty.

1:01:34.269 --> 1:01:37.072
- No!
- Hey. What the frig?

1:01:37.105 --> 1:01:39.341
Maybe you should pull up
your pants, huh?

1:01:39.374 --> 1:01:41.743
Just hike them up,
pack up your precious TV,

1:01:41.777 --> 1:01:43.645
get your lazy ass
out of this house.

1:01:43.679 --> 1:01:46.215
Lazy?

1:01:46.248 --> 1:01:48.417
How dare you!

1:01:48.450 --> 1:01:50.352
You know how much
I hate that word.

1:01:50.385 --> 1:01:52.721
My parents used it,
my teachers used it.

1:01:52.754 --> 1:01:54.590
And now you?

1:01:54.623 --> 1:01:56.592
Shame on you, Susan.

1:01:56.625 --> 1:01:59.261
You're better than that.

1:01:59.294 --> 1:02:01.363
You know what I hate, Greg?

1:02:01.396 --> 1:02:04.766
I hate how you will find
any excuse you can

1:02:04.801 --> 1:02:07.369
not to go to work,
help with the kids,

1:02:07.402 --> 1:02:10.472
do anything whatsoever
around the house.

1:02:10.506 --> 1:02:13.609
Oh, I don't do
a damn thing, huh?

1:02:13.642 --> 1:02:16.345
Let's have it.
What do you do, huh?

1:02:22.451 --> 1:02:25.254
I'm waiting.

1:02:25.287 --> 1:02:27.256
Oh, you think you're frigging
better than me, huh?

1:02:27.289 --> 1:02:29.291
You think you're frigging
better than me, huh?

1:02:29.324 --> 1:02:31.226
Well I have a BA in English.

1:02:31.260 --> 1:02:32.561
What have you done
with your life?

1:02:32.594 --> 1:02:35.697
Huh? What have you done
with your life?

1:02:35.731 --> 1:02:37.766
I ask you.

1:03:00.522 --> 1:03:01.757
Find me!

1:03:01.791 --> 1:03:04.560
Find me or you all die!

1:03:04.593 --> 1:03:07.563
Aaaah!

1:03:11.266 --> 1:03:12.467
Aaaah!

1:03:16.638 --> 1:03:18.640
What the frig?!

1:03:21.343 --> 1:03:23.512
Where am I going?

1:03:26.481 --> 1:03:29.685
The ravine near highway 11
and Ryerson Avenue!

1:03:29.718 --> 1:03:31.353
Aaah!

1:03:33.355 --> 1:03:35.257
Oh! Oh!

1:03:39.829 --> 1:03:42.331
I don't know where that is.

1:03:42.364 --> 1:03:43.732
Aaaah!

1:03:43.765 --> 1:03:45.367
Go south of Prescott Road

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:47.804
until you reach
the second set of lights!

1:03:47.837 --> 1:03:50.439
Go!

1:03:50.472 --> 1:03:51.740
- Come on!
- Hurry!

1:03:51.773 --> 1:03:55.410
Over here! Go faster!

1:03:55.444 --> 1:03:56.745
Right here!

1:03:56.778 --> 1:03:58.815
No, no, no.

1:03:59.782 --> 1:04:01.249
Aaah!

1:04:04.519 --> 1:04:06.455
I'm sorry, PG.

1:04:06.488 --> 1:04:09.291
You should be.
This is all your doing.

1:04:09.324 --> 1:04:12.594
Could you move over and make
room for my wagon please?

1:04:19.735 --> 1:04:22.304
Thanks, bud.

1:04:24.807 --> 1:04:27.376
You think I'm lazy, PG?

1:05:11.788 --> 1:05:14.289
Who's mom talking to?

1:05:14.322 --> 1:05:17.459
Kids, kids get out of the truck
and come inside.

1:05:17.492 --> 1:05:19.327
Why? Who's the skirt?

1:05:19.361 --> 1:05:20.729
She needs to talk
to your friend, okay?

1:05:20.762 --> 1:05:22.832
It isn't safe out here.

1:05:22.865 --> 1:05:24.733
Come, children.

1:05:24.766 --> 1:05:28.770
You don't want to be
anywhere near that... thing.

1:05:28.805 --> 1:05:30.772
Pandora.

1:05:30.807 --> 1:05:34.776
I see you've come to cleanse
the universe of me once again.

1:05:34.811 --> 1:05:37.780
Immaculate timing as always.

1:05:37.814 --> 1:05:40.682
Drop the disguise and show
these humans the face

1:05:40.716 --> 1:05:42.919
they will bow to once
you enslave them

1:05:42.952 --> 1:05:45.520
into endless servitude.

1:05:45.554 --> 1:05:46.789
Endless servitude?

1:05:46.823 --> 1:05:49.758
Sounds like being
married to you, Susan.

1:05:49.792 --> 1:05:51.828
Greg, shut up
and get out of the truck.

1:05:51.861 --> 1:05:53.628
Kids, come inside, okay?

1:05:53.662 --> 1:05:55.764
Let these two figure
their shit out.

1:05:55.798 --> 1:05:58.467
Dad, don't.

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.469
Just do what she says, child.

1:06:00.502 --> 1:06:01.570
I will not ask you again.

1:06:01.603 --> 1:06:03.438
Uh, excuse me?

1:06:03.472 --> 1:06:06.742
You don't talk to me like that.

1:06:06.775 --> 1:06:09.377
Luke, here's my idea.

1:06:09.411 --> 1:06:12.481
You go beat her up,
and we'll drive away.

1:06:12.514 --> 1:06:14.516
She doesn't look that tough.

1:06:14.549 --> 1:06:17.552
Do not let her weak
human skin fool you.

1:06:17.586 --> 1:06:20.589
She will strike you
down immediately.

1:06:20.622 --> 1:06:23.692
Good to know. Thanks, PG.
Luke, beat her up.

1:06:23.725 --> 1:06:25.527
But PG just said...

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:28.764
Shut up, your wiener,
and go fight her like a hero!

1:06:28.798 --> 1:06:30.900
Do it now!

1:06:34.103 --> 1:06:35.604
You know what, Mimi?

1:06:35.637 --> 1:06:38.373
I can't. I just can't.

1:06:38.406 --> 1:06:40.642
You go beat up
that lady right now!

1:06:40.675 --> 1:06:43.311
I'll bash her brains
if you don't.

1:06:43.345 --> 1:06:45.747
This has gone too far.
I've had enough.

1:06:45.782 --> 1:06:47.582
You can't push me
around anymore.

1:06:47.616 --> 1:06:50.752
Fine!
Then you're out of the band!

1:06:50.787 --> 1:06:53.388
Greg, for once
in your lazy ass life,

1:06:53.421 --> 1:06:55.390
you don't actually have
to do anything, okay?

1:06:55.423 --> 1:06:58.627
Just get out of the truck
and come inside.

1:07:13.475 --> 1:07:15.410
How's this for lazy, Susan?

1:07:16.813 --> 1:07:18.446
Greg.

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:20.615
Hang on, kiddo.

1:07:20.649 --> 1:07:24.653
Greg, don't even
thing about it!

1:07:24.686 --> 1:07:28.090
Bye!

1:07:32.962 --> 1:07:36.098
We must act fast before
he's able to regenerate.

1:07:36.132 --> 1:07:38.433
This beast will consume
all the light in the universe

1:07:38.466 --> 1:07:39.668
if we don't stop him.

1:07:39.701 --> 1:07:42.537
Okay. So what do we do?

1:07:42.571 --> 1:07:44.706
Follow me.

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:49.846
Slowly, slowly.

1:07:50.947 --> 1:07:54.482
Gonna wrap you up, okay, PG?

1:07:54.917 --> 1:07:59.387
I feel my life slipping away.

1:07:59.421 --> 1:08:01.656
Stay with me, PG.

1:08:01.690 --> 1:08:03.425
I'm not going to let you go.

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:06.796
There's only one remedy
for this curse.

1:08:06.829 --> 1:08:09.764
You must give me the gem.

1:08:09.799 --> 1:08:11.801
What?

1:08:11.834 --> 1:08:15.503
No, no, you'll kill everybody.

1:08:15.537 --> 1:08:17.772
It's the only way.

1:08:17.807 --> 1:08:20.109
The gem is linked
to my life force.

1:08:20.142 --> 1:08:25.380
Once it's in my possession,
I will regain my strength.

1:08:30.219 --> 1:08:31.653
Excuse me.

1:08:31.686 --> 1:08:33.722
Mr. Goreman.

1:08:35.825 --> 1:08:38.493
Can I get a moment alone
with my daughter, please?

1:08:41.130 --> 1:08:43.498
Thank you.

1:08:55.811 --> 1:08:57.880
How you doing?

1:08:57.914 --> 1:09:00.515
Dad, I'm sacred.

1:09:00.548 --> 1:09:02.751
I don't know what to do.

1:09:02.785 --> 1:09:05.754
First off, that's a lie.

1:09:05.788 --> 1:09:07.455
I know for a fact
you've never been scared

1:09:07.489 --> 1:09:09.624
of anything in your life.

1:09:09.658 --> 1:09:12.795
That's true.

1:09:12.828 --> 1:09:19.168
Look, I know I'm not
a good dad or a smart dad.

1:09:19.201 --> 1:09:21.703
But I still have
some dad wisdom for you.

1:09:23.638 --> 1:09:27.843
When I was your age, a weird guy
in a van outside my school asked

1:09:27.877 --> 1:09:30.679
if I wanted to see
his baseball cards.

1:09:30.712 --> 1:09:32.547
I said yes without thinking.

1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:34.683
And he took me
in the back of his van

1:09:34.716 --> 1:09:38.553
and showed me
his giant collection

1:09:38.586 --> 1:09:42.258
of pristine baseball cards.

1:09:42.291 --> 1:09:44.559
I had a lot of fun.

1:09:44.592 --> 1:09:47.830
And I'm thankful I put my trust
in that creepy weirdo.

1:09:49.298 --> 1:09:54.170
So I think you should trust your
weird murdering monster friend.

1:09:54.203 --> 1:09:56.571
It's the grown up thing to do.

1:09:58.874 --> 1:10:01.978
Thanks, Dad.
That makes a lot of sense.

1:10:02.011 --> 1:10:03.879
No problem, kiddo.

1:10:03.913 --> 1:10:06.215
I need a bit of a think.

1:10:06.248 --> 1:10:08.784
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

1:10:15.590 --> 1:10:18.260
Your partner made a very poor
choice taking the evil one

1:10:18.294 --> 1:10:20.562
from us.

1:10:32.674 --> 1:10:35.710
Oh, wow!

1:10:35.744 --> 1:10:37.947
My mistake was
letting him live.

1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:41.616
It was selfish of me
to want him to suffer forever.

1:10:41.649 --> 1:10:44.820
I won't make that mistake again.

1:10:44.854 --> 1:10:47.223
Drink it.

1:10:47.256 --> 1:10:49.325
It's time for you
to stand beside me

1:10:49.358 --> 1:10:52.694
and right the wrongs
of this universe.

1:10:52.727 --> 1:10:54.596
I'll drink that.

1:11:01.736 --> 1:11:03.571
Is it gross?

1:11:11.313 --> 1:11:13.215
The final battle has begun.

1:11:13.249 --> 1:11:16.919
The fate of the universe
rests in Pandora's hands.

1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:19.721
And what if she fails?

1:11:19.754 --> 1:11:21.689
Then there will be
no stopping him.

1:11:21.723 --> 1:11:23.926
She is our last hope.

1:11:23.959 --> 1:11:28.297
Stop hogging these blugels.
They're for everyone.

1:11:32.001 --> 1:11:35.271
Pass those blugels.

1:11:52.321 --> 1:11:54.390
Hi, God.

1:11:54.423 --> 1:11:57.293
Now, I know I don't do
all the goody two-shoes stuff

1:11:57.326 --> 1:12:01.897
you say everybody should do,
but I can't help it.

1:12:01.931 --> 1:12:04.900
And I'll do whatever
the heck I want, okay?

1:12:06.435 --> 1:12:09.238
Anyways, I need your advice.

1:12:09.271 --> 1:12:13.775
A huge battle between evil and
worse evil is about to go down.

1:12:13.809 --> 1:12:16.812
And I have a very
big decision to make.

1:12:21.283 --> 1:12:23.419
What shades should I wear?

1:12:23.452 --> 1:12:25.387
That's a trick question.

1:12:25.421 --> 1:12:28.257
I know I'm going
to wear the zebra ones.

1:12:28.290 --> 1:12:32.795
In conclusion,
why am I even talking to you?

1:12:32.828 --> 1:12:37.299
There's a new God in town,
and his name is Psycho Goreman.

1:12:37.333 --> 1:12:40.169
And he's coming for you, buddy.

1:12:47.977 --> 1:12:51.280
So this TV won't stop bleeding.

1:12:51.313 --> 1:12:53.782
Okay, here's the deal, man.

1:12:53.816 --> 1:12:56.852
I'll give you the gem
so you can kill that mean lady.

1:12:56.886 --> 1:13:00.356
But you have to promise
that you won't kill us, okay?

1:13:00.389 --> 1:13:03.392
I will not kill you,
little creature.

1:13:03.425 --> 1:13:05.261
Or your family of idiots.

1:13:05.294 --> 1:13:07.830
Do you mean it?

1:13:07.863 --> 1:13:09.832
Yes.

1:13:11.766 --> 1:13:13.735
Wait, what about telling him
not to kill everybody else

1:13:13.768 --> 1:13:15.471
on the planet?

1:13:15.504 --> 1:13:18.941
Oh, yeah. Oops.

1:13:18.974 --> 1:13:22.311
Oops is right.

1:13:22.344 --> 1:13:23.879
Oh, crud.

1:13:23.913 --> 1:13:27.349
What? Where's the gem?

1:13:42.031 --> 1:13:44.833
Your time is up, evil one.

1:13:44.867 --> 1:13:47.002
Oh, man! Get out of here, lady!

1:13:47.036 --> 1:13:49.872
Step aside, Mimi!

1:13:51.507 --> 1:13:54.510
Mom?

1:13:54.543 --> 1:13:56.412
Susan?

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:03.519
- Hi.
- Shut up, thief.

1:14:03.552 --> 1:14:05.854
Just walk away, child.

1:14:05.888 --> 1:14:09.959
It's time I rid the universe
of this cursed thing.

1:14:09.992 --> 1:14:11.527
Give me the gem, boy.

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:14.363
No, not until my family is safe.

1:14:14.396 --> 1:14:15.931
That's the deal.

1:14:15.965 --> 1:14:17.933
You don't get it.

1:14:17.967 --> 1:14:19.435
Do you, lady?

1:14:19.468 --> 1:14:22.538
Nobody tells me what to do.

1:14:22.571 --> 1:14:26.774
Not you, not her, not him.

1:14:26.809 --> 1:14:28.377
Yeah.

1:14:28.410 --> 1:14:31.347
Not the president. Not anybody!

1:14:31.380 --> 1:14:33.415
Mimi, this is serious!

1:14:33.449 --> 1:14:34.984
Stop it right now!

1:14:35.017 --> 1:14:37.253
Never, ever, ever!

1:14:37.286 --> 1:14:39.221
That's some good
parenting, honey.

1:14:39.255 --> 1:14:41.357
I wish I could help.

1:14:41.390 --> 1:14:44.860
I'm just too damn lazy.

1:14:44.893 --> 1:14:47.296
You!

1:14:47.329 --> 1:14:48.897
Whoa.

1:14:48.931 --> 1:14:50.966
Susan.

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.434
Think about what
you're doing here.

1:14:52.468 --> 1:14:53.469
Hey.

1:14:53.502 --> 1:14:54.903
Aaaah!

1:14:54.937 --> 1:14:56.472
Mimi, stop!

1:14:56.505 --> 1:14:59.408
Shut up, you fat traitor!

1:15:05.614 --> 1:15:08.951
Killing me won't bring back
the thousands of warriors

1:15:08.984 --> 1:15:11.387
I've massacred
with my bare hands.

1:15:11.420 --> 1:15:15.524
No, but ending you will light
a new dawn for my people.

1:15:15.557 --> 1:15:19.461
And I shall lead the galaxy
toward a bright future,

1:15:19.495 --> 1:15:23.465
built on a law
and order of the Templars.

1:15:24.266 --> 1:15:29.204
Go, Pandora! I believe in you.
I've always believed in you.

1:15:31.974 --> 1:15:36.045
Just couldn't stay away
from the TV, could you, Greg?

1:15:36.078 --> 1:15:38.914
Susan, I would still
forgive you for this

1:15:38.947 --> 1:15:41.383
if you stopped right now.

1:15:42.584 --> 1:15:44.420
I'll go to therapy now
if you want,

1:15:44.453 --> 1:15:47.589
if you still want to do that.
if that's what you still want.

1:15:55.331 --> 1:15:57.633
Come on, yes!

1:15:57.666 --> 1:15:58.967
Die!

1:15:59.001 --> 1:16:00.903
Please. Don't.

1:16:00.936 --> 1:16:04.006
I've been doing
a lot of thinking, Greg.

1:16:09.011 --> 1:16:13.515
I think you're the cause
of all the headaches in my life.

1:16:14.650 --> 1:16:18.520
And I think it's payback time!

1:16:18.554 --> 1:16:22.024
Susan, you're choking me.

1:16:22.057 --> 1:16:25.494
Give me the gem.
Don't make me use this, bro.

1:16:25.527 --> 1:16:28.197
It's just like Dad said.

1:16:28.230 --> 1:16:32.267
People are the real monsters.

1:16:32.301 --> 1:16:34.937
And you're one of them.

1:16:42.411 --> 1:16:44.446
Is it not part
of the Templar code

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:49.651
to allow a defeated foe one last
chance for battle, if requested?

1:16:49.685 --> 1:16:52.988
The Templar code
says lots of things.

1:16:53.021 --> 1:16:56.959
You are weak,
and we have the gem.

1:16:56.992 --> 1:17:00.062
There is no way
you could defeat me in battle.

1:17:00.095 --> 1:17:03.665
I do not request
hand-to-hand combat.

1:17:03.699 --> 1:17:07.336
If you are truly the warrior
you claim to be,

1:17:07.369 --> 1:17:10.339
you will honor this request.

1:17:18.247 --> 1:17:20.416
Name your contest.

1:17:20.449 --> 1:17:24.420
I will defeat you
no matter the circumstance.

1:17:31.393 --> 1:17:33.562
Mimi!

1:17:33.595 --> 1:17:35.931
Huh?

1:17:38.634 --> 1:17:41.003
You will decide the contest.

1:17:44.740 --> 1:17:48.610
Okay, you three
will be Team Suck.

1:17:48.644 --> 1:17:51.346
You two plus me
will be Team Hero.

1:17:51.380 --> 1:17:54.349
If Team Hero wins,
we get the gem.

1:17:54.383 --> 1:17:58.687
And if Team Suck wins,
you can have PG.

1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:00.355
Got it?

1:18:00.389 --> 1:18:03.225
Could you explain
the switcheroo part again?

1:18:03.258 --> 1:18:05.994
Nope.
Should have paid attention.

1:18:06.028 --> 1:18:08.597
Okay, chumps, let's do this.

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:13.937
Ready...

1:18:16.405 --> 1:18:18.440
Set...

1:18:18.474 --> 1:18:21.477
Still love you, Susan.

1:18:21.510 --> 1:18:24.513
- Crazy Ball!
- Crazy Ball!

1:18:37.493 --> 1:18:39.495
Ow!

1:18:46.468 --> 1:18:49.671
I don't understand sports.

1:18:49.705 --> 1:18:51.607
No.

1:18:55.377 --> 1:18:57.346
Quick!

1:18:57.379 --> 1:18:58.680
Do Jumping Jacks!

1:18:58.714 --> 1:19:00.616
Crazy Ball. Crazy Ball.

1:19:00.649 --> 1:19:01.750
What are Jumping Jacks again?

1:19:01.784 --> 1:19:03.820
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1:19:03.853 --> 1:19:06.655
Where are your gods
tonight now, Pandora?

1:19:09.458 --> 1:19:11.760
Aah!

1:19:14.663 --> 1:19:16.632
Yeah!

1:19:22.104 --> 1:19:25.340
I win butt bonus.

1:19:28.377 --> 1:19:30.312
66 points.

1:19:30.345 --> 1:19:32.581
One more point
and Team Suck wins.

1:19:32.614 --> 1:19:34.349
Dream on, back stabber.

1:19:34.383 --> 1:19:37.787
This is for the time you made me
eat my own sand castle.

1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:39.621
I was helping you!

1:19:39.655 --> 1:19:44.293
Now that beautiful sand castle
will be with you forever!

1:19:44.326 --> 1:19:48.430
I was so sick I had to miss
a week of school.

1:19:48.463 --> 1:19:50.699
You're welcome!

1:19:56.705 --> 1:19:59.441
The switcheroo.

1:20:00.877 --> 1:20:03.712
If they get
the switcheroo, they'll win!

1:20:03.745 --> 1:20:07.249
Oh, this game is
complete nonsense.

1:20:10.586 --> 1:20:14.289
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1:20:14.323 --> 1:20:18.393
Dumb dumb chuck, here we go!

1:20:26.936 --> 1:20:29.271
Yes!

1:20:29.304 --> 1:20:31.406
I win again.

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:33.241
We win!

1:20:35.644 --> 1:20:38.347
Aaah!

1:20:38.380 --> 1:20:41.516
How does failure taste, Pandora?

1:20:43.485 --> 1:20:45.454
Now give me the gem.

1:20:45.487 --> 1:20:47.756
I will humor this no longer.

1:20:51.660 --> 1:20:53.595
No way!

1:20:56.431 --> 1:20:57.800
What are you doing?!

1:20:57.834 --> 1:20:59.768
The beast must die!

1:20:59.802 --> 1:21:01.536
Mimi, get out!

1:21:01.570 --> 1:21:02.805
No!

1:21:02.839 --> 1:21:04.773
I'll protect you, PG.

1:21:04.807 --> 1:21:07.376
Aaah!

1:21:07.409 --> 1:21:09.846
Luke, give me the gem!

1:21:09.879 --> 1:21:13.482
Please throw it to me, you dork!

1:21:17.686 --> 1:21:20.489
I don't know.

1:21:20.522 --> 1:21:24.493
You're always so mean to me,
and I just wish that you would

1:21:24.526 --> 1:21:27.663
say you were sorry for once.

1:21:28.865 --> 1:21:30.766
And I'm always there
for you when you need me,

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:33.402
but I thought we were a team.

1:21:33.435 --> 1:21:36.271

1:23:08.697 --> 1:23:10.365
Hey.

1:23:10.398 --> 1:23:14.402
Yeah, you need to take me
to the hospital, okay?

1:23:14.436 --> 1:23:18.473
I can't feel my hand.
I think it might be broken.

1:23:18.507 --> 1:23:19.909
Luke, can you drive?

1:23:19.942 --> 1:23:25.514
- No.
- The judgment is...

1:23:25.547 --> 1:23:27.682
death.

1:23:31.419 --> 1:23:34.824
You're toast now,
you big metal moron.

1:23:45.433 --> 1:23:47.435
Even with your powers restored,

1:23:47.469 --> 1:23:50.605
how can you expect
to defeat my holy blade?

1:23:50.639 --> 1:23:53.708
You are defenseless
against me.

1:23:53.742 --> 1:23:56.545
Then I'll make my own.

1:24:38.988 --> 1:24:42.859
You'll not stand between me
and my holy destiny.

1:24:44.827 --> 1:24:46.829
Frig off.

1:25:06.715 --> 1:25:08.818
I'm not going to say it.

1:25:08.851 --> 1:25:10.786
But I have something
to tell you.

1:25:47.890 --> 1:25:51.493
Not my hunky boys!

1:25:51.526 --> 1:25:53.930
Aaaah!

1:26:03.738 --> 1:26:06.242
You have no idea
what you've done.

1:26:06.275 --> 1:26:09.145
The universe
as you know it is finished.

1:26:10.578 --> 1:26:13.215
Thank you.

1:26:13.249 --> 1:26:14.683
I'm proud of you guys.

1:26:14.716 --> 1:26:17.552
Finish me, nameless one.

1:26:17.585 --> 1:26:20.555
Get this over with
so that I can be at peace.

1:26:20.588 --> 1:26:22.925
There will never
be peace for you.

1:26:22.959 --> 1:26:24.794
I've been to the after world,

1:26:24.827 --> 1:26:29.597
and it's a place where fools
like you suffer the worst.

1:26:29.631 --> 1:26:32.168
And my name is...

1:26:32.201 --> 1:26:34.870
Psycho Goreman.

1:26:37.706 --> 1:26:39.842
That's a beautiful name.

1:26:39.875 --> 1:26:41.676
You fought with honor.

1:26:41.710 --> 1:26:44.713
It's only fitting I give you
a warriors death.

1:26:44.746 --> 1:26:46.949
No, not that!

1:26:46.983 --> 1:26:49.185
No!

1:26:49.218 --> 1:26:50.853
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.

1:26:50.886 --> 1:26:52.221
What is he doing?

1:26:52.254 --> 1:26:54.123
Oh, you don't want to see this.

1:27:03.299 --> 1:27:07.535
You know, I remember when this
used to be a shoe factory.

1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:21.283
Delicious.

1:27:21.317 --> 1:27:23.551
Well, what now?

1:27:23.585 --> 1:27:26.322
Now I will do
what I was meant to do...

1:27:26.355 --> 1:27:28.157
destroy everything.

1:27:28.190 --> 1:27:31.293
The age of chaos begins anew.

1:27:31.327 --> 1:27:35.898
Yes, and?

1:27:35.931 --> 1:27:39.135
And I will spare your lives.

1:27:46.909 --> 1:27:49.577
Take it.

1:27:49.611 --> 1:27:50.913
Really?

1:27:50.946 --> 1:27:54.817
I don't need it
anymore, little one.

1:27:54.850 --> 1:27:58.686
For the first time
in centuries I feel whole.

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:01.589
Thanks to your family,
I now know that true power

1:28:01.623 --> 1:28:04.193
comes from within.

1:28:04.226 --> 1:28:06.862
The power of love.

1:28:06.896 --> 1:28:08.630
What?

1:28:08.663 --> 1:28:10.299
Goodbye, Mimi.

1:28:10.332 --> 1:28:14.837
Goodbye, Greg and Susan and...

1:28:14.870 --> 1:28:17.373
boy.

1:28:17.406 --> 1:28:20.675
It's time for me to take
this new found power

1:28:20.708 --> 1:28:24.146
and use it to destroy
the galaxy.

1:28:28.417 --> 1:28:30.886
PG, wait!

1:29:07.957 --> 1:29:12.394
Well, we learned a lot today.

1:29:12.428 --> 1:29:14.762
About what?

1:29:16.298 --> 1:29:19.201
Okay, okay, let's go
to the hospital.

1:29:19.235 --> 1:29:24.206
Okay, Greg, come on.
Come. This way.

1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:26.175
Whoa, okay.

to stop the rampage

as a giant naked purple man.
