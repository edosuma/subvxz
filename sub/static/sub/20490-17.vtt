WEBVTT

00:02.802 --> 00:05.605
It's been so long i almost
forgot how to contact you.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.806
You never forget anything.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.174
That's the source of your
power.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.211
It's not like you to
expose yourself like this.

00:11.611 --> 00:13.578
What's so important?

00:13.613 --> 00:19.219
The wheels are turning, adam,
and wheels within wheels.

00:19.254 --> 00:20.820
I don't want to
see you crushed in them?

00:21.221 --> 00:23.223
So what's going on?

00:23.258 --> 00:24.824
Not like this.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.227
You know where to meet me.

00:27.262 --> 00:29.629
One hour.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.661 --> 01:03.228
What the hell are you doing?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.864
Sneaking off without telling
anyone where you're going,

01:05.265 --> 01:06.466
i could ask you the same thing.

01:06.501 --> 01:07.667
Well, i got some business.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.669
It doesn't concern mutant x.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.472
How many times
have you told us we need to
watch each other's backs.

01:12.507 --> 01:14.039
All right.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.277
My back doesn't need watching
right now, so you gotta go.

01:17.312 --> 01:19.644
What's going on, adam?

01:19.679 --> 01:22.482
I'm meeting an old friend who's
got some information for me.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.049
About what?

01:24.084 --> 01:27.687
He said i'm in
some kind of danger.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.490
Well, so you just decide
to take off on your own?

01:30.890 --> 01:32.057
All right, look,

01:32.092 --> 01:35.295
this guy comes from a world
that i only get glimpses of.

01:35.330 --> 01:38.498
What is he? Some
kind of covert op?

01:38.533 --> 01:39.699
No, it's more than that.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.067
He's the kind of guy
who sees the big picture,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.504
knows the names of the
folks who actually run the show.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.307
But as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

01:47.342 --> 01:48.873
they don't even
know this guy exists,

01:48.908 --> 01:50.875
and his life depends
on keeping it that way.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.713
So, if he sees you here with me
he's not going to make the meet

01:53.748 --> 01:56.533
look, adam, i...
- no, no, no, no.

01:56.568 --> 01:59.319
So, you go.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:59.354 --> 02:00.520
Thank you for coming.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.522
I'm going to be fine.
Now, get out of here.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.725
Go. Go.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.351
Adam!

02:42.962 --> 02:44.564
Adam!

02:52.172 --> 02:54.574
Guys, it's shalimar.
We got trouble.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.145
I am adam kane.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.383
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

03:03.418 --> 03:06.551
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.789
But in many, their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.793
They developed
super-human abilities.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.788
Together with four
of the most powerful,

03:43.823 --> 03:46.226
i fight to protect a world that
doesn't even know we exist.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.032
We are... mutant x.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.643
No luck.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.645
I've searched the satellite
images of all the roads leading

04:05.680 --> 04:07.247
from the harbour
from when adam was taken.

04:07.282 --> 04:09.614
They've been doctored.

04:09.649 --> 04:12.817
Dammit. Twenty more
feet i would've had them.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.854
This guy adam was meeting,
did... did he give you a name?

04:15.255 --> 04:19.259
No.
Just that he had some kind of
information on danger to adam.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.661
It sounds like
he was the danger.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.263
Maybe he set adam up.

04:23.663 --> 04:26.466
Well, not unless
part of his scheme was
to be shot by his friends.

04:26.501 --> 04:28.468
One of the bullets
grazed his arm.

04:28.503 --> 04:30.034
Well, that's great.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.071
Maybe we can get a blood
sample and id him from his dna.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.273
I'm ahead of you.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.675
I just don't know how
much luck we're going to have.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.677
I mean, adam said this guy
is as underground as it gets.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.880
Well, it's worth a try.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.683
What is it, shal?

04:44.083 --> 04:44.884
Just...

04:45.285 --> 04:46.886
adam said that the people
he was dealing with were

04:46.921 --> 04:48.453
the power behind the power.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.054
You know, the people
that really run things.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.691
Yeah, but we've dealt
with covert agencies before.

04:52.091 --> 04:53.658
Yeah, but even adam was scared.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.695
I'm just afraid of what
they're going to do to him.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.697
Well, they had guns,
and didn't shoot him.

04:57.732 --> 04:58.898
They must not want him dead.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.703
Not yet. We have
to find him. Fast.

05:13.713 --> 05:17.282
We're the tribunal, mr. Kane.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.720
You might say that we
are the last outpost of justice.

05:20.755 --> 05:24.123
We punish those criminals
who believe themselves to be

05:24.158 --> 05:27.692
otherwise untouchable.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.530
All right, i'm not
a criminal, i'm a scientist.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.534
That is what we intend
to prove or disprove.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.100
I have certain rights.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.702
First, i demand a phone cali...

05:37.737 --> 05:39.739
this is not about
defendant's rights.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.706
This is not about due process.

05:41.741 --> 05:48.548
This is about uncovering the
truth and punishing the guilty.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.168
You'll have plenty of
time to present your defence.

05:51.203 --> 05:53.753
Defence? I don't even
know what i'm charged with.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.556
Everything will be
explained to you in due time.

05:56.956 --> 06:01.361
Take these proceedings
very seriously, mr. Kane.

06:01.396 --> 06:05.765
Your life will depend upon it.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.132
Maybe these guys
that are holding adam
are looking for some

06:08.167 --> 06:10.970
kind of a ransom
or trying to get some kind
of low-down on his tech.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
Until we get some
facts, we're just guessing.

06:13.408 --> 06:15.340
Yeah.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.377
I'm just
trying to make some kind of
sense out this, you know?

06:17.412 --> 06:19.396
Someone gets
grabbed on the streets,

06:19.431 --> 06:21.407
it's easy to
figure out, you know?

06:21.442 --> 06:23.383
With adam, the game runs like...

06:23.418 --> 06:25.750
like ten levels deep.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.787
These guys that grabbed him
probably have no idea who they

06:27.822 --> 06:29.754
were grabbing him for, or why.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.557
Which is why we need
to nail down the truth.

06:32.592 --> 06:36.195
And the first
step is finding the man who
brought adam to that meet.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.598
Well, i couldn't
trace adam's call.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.599
It was on the secure server.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.218
Encrypted all the freakin' way.

06:42.253 --> 06:43.768
What about the blood sample?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.405
Well, i pulled
his genetic fingerprint.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.971
But figuring out whose it is,

06:47.006 --> 06:48.573
is going to be
a whole other thing.

06:48.608 --> 06:52.612
See,
unfortunately - 'scuse me -
the official bodies only

06:53.012 --> 06:55.014
started registering dna
samples back in the late '80s.

06:55.049 --> 06:57.016
If he's been underground
later than that...

06:57.051 --> 07:00.219
we're toast.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.186
Great.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.823
Great, now we have
nothing else to go on.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.842
Starting to
feel like a nightmare.

07:05.877 --> 07:07.827
I'm afraid it's the real world.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.995
One we know nothing about.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.032
You think he's going to be okay?

07:13.067 --> 07:14.999
Yeah, he's adam.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.036
No matter what's
happening to him,

07:17.071 --> 07:19.003
he's still got
his mind and his will.

07:19.038 --> 07:23.042
And that means he
has resources other people
wouldn't even dream of.

07:23.077 --> 07:24.644
Yeah.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.617
I'll be fine.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.854
Mr. Kane, my
name is janet nicholls.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.056
I've been assigned
to represent you.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.460
<sighs> well,
thank you miss nicholls,

07:40.495 --> 07:43.380
but i'd like
to call my own lawyer.

07:43.415 --> 07:46.265
I'm afraid that'll
be impossible.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.232
All right.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.670
Then i'd like you to
contact some friends of mine.

07:50.705 --> 07:52.236
I've been kidnapped.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.674
I've been taken god knows
where, and my rights have been

07:55.074 --> 07:57.041
violated in more
ways than i can count.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.678
Well, i thought it
had been explained to you.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.281
This tribunal operates
outside the purview of the

08:02.316 --> 08:04.283
traditional justice system.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.887
Right. And ever since i got here
everybody uses double-speak.

08:07.922 --> 08:11.508
Now, tell me something: What
exactly am i being charged with?

08:11.543 --> 08:15.094
You're accused of manipulating
the dna of over one thousand

08:15.495 --> 08:18.898
human beings; of attempting
to create a master race of

08:18.933 --> 08:22.301
super-powered mutants
with which you plan to shift the

08:22.336 --> 08:25.104
balance of world
power for your own ends.

08:25.139 --> 08:28.325
<laughs> shift the balance?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.476
Huh - wait. Are you serious?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.313
The prosecution plans to prove
that you not only inflicted

08:34.347 --> 08:37.116
your victims with pain and
suffering, but that the mutants

08:37.517 --> 08:40.284
you created have
wreaked havoc on society.

08:40.318 --> 08:44.724
It's absurd. Who's bringing
these charges? The government?

08:45.124 --> 08:47.492
Mr. Kane, this
is an impartial body.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.930
A case doesn't
come this far unless it
has been fully researched.

08:50.965 --> 08:54.333
You mean unless it's been fully
decided already that i'm guilty.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.335
Huh, now, tell me something:

08:56.736 --> 08:58.738
Are you even going to pretend
to mount a defence for me?

08:58.773 --> 08:59.939
That's the job i've been given.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.958
The job you've been given?

09:01.993 --> 09:03.943
My life is in your hands.

09:03.978 --> 09:07.111
I am aware of that.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.949
All right, look, my entire
scientific career has been

09:10.349 --> 09:12.316
dedicated to helping people.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.154
And the people that i work
with are not dangerous mutants;

09:15.555 --> 09:17.557
they're human beings.

09:17.957 --> 09:23.563
They're heroes
who risk their lives every
day trying to help people.

09:23.598 --> 09:26.330
That's good.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.567
That passion,
that forthright quality.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.770
You're going to
need all of that and more.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.172
Because once you get into
that room, you should be aware

09:33.573 --> 09:36.776
that there is likely not going
to be one person rooting for

09:37.176 --> 09:41.546
you to be innocent.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.383
All right. Tell me something.

09:44.418 --> 09:49.188
What about you?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.562
Get a good night's
sleep, mr. Kane.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.399
You're going to need all
of your energy for the trial.

10:15.181 --> 10:19.986
Adam kane, you've heard
the charges against you.

10:20.021 --> 10:21.988
How do you plead?

10:22.023 --> 10:23.589
Well, first,

10:23.990 --> 10:26.392
i want
to say that i don't recognize
the validity of this court.

10:26.427 --> 10:28.794
Be that as it may, our judgement
is just as binding and our

10:28.829 --> 10:31.998
sentences just as final.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.166
I ask again, how do you plead?

10:35.201 --> 10:37.203
Where are the charges
against me coming from?

10:37.603 --> 10:39.170
You're out of order.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.572
You're not doing
yourself any good.

10:41.607 --> 10:46.812
Your honour, my client pleads
not guilty to all charges.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.981
Mr. Warren, you have
heard the defendant.

10:50.016 --> 10:54.020
You may proceed directly
to the presentation of evidence.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.223
Take him to the chair.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.391
What is this?

11:00.426 --> 11:01.993
They just want
to get to the truth.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.030
This is some sort
of neuro-imager, isn't it?

11:04.065 --> 11:05.649
Where did you get this?

11:05.684 --> 11:07.198
I invented this technology.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.235
I realize that your arrogance
makes it difficult for you to

11:09.270 --> 11:11.237
believe that there's anyone
else creating things in the

11:11.272 --> 11:13.239
world of science,
but it is true.

11:13.274 --> 11:14.405
Okay, wait.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.606
So you're going
to probe my mind.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.208
You're going to
pull memories out of me?

11:17.243 --> 11:21.247
No. We're going to use your
own mental reconstructions
of the truth.

11:21.282 --> 11:22.848
The machine's been programmed
with the times and dates:

11:23.249 --> 11:24.050
You provide the pictures.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.651
Turn him around.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.817
All right. Wait.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.854
Fine, see, if you think that
you're going to get evidence to

11:28.889 --> 11:30.856
support this trumped-up
case against me, you're wrong.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.858
My actions will
prove my innocence.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.462
Well, we'll see.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.630
April 14 of last year.

11:39.665 --> 11:42.468
One of your mutant creations,
ashley elliott, used her

11:42.868 --> 11:45.671
powers in an attempt to sabotage
the entire power grid of

11:46.072 --> 11:48.039
the eastern seaboard.

11:48.074 --> 11:52.278
That's not
the way it happened.

11:52.313 --> 11:56.447
No.
That's not the way it was.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.484
The resulting blackout
caused the deaths of no less

11:58.519 --> 12:00.451
than thirty-seven people.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.689
And the financial loss
from fire and theft totalled

12:03.724 --> 12:06.457
tens of millions of dollars.

12:06.492 --> 12:11.297
There are no
secrets here, mr. Kane.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.666
Hey, jesse.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.504
Turn up anything on
that genetic fingerprint yet?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.906
Nothing. And unless we just
start stopping people in the

12:20.941 --> 12:22.908
streets for
random blood tests...

12:22.943 --> 12:25.711
what about the genomex data?

12:26.112 --> 12:28.114
You think this
guy might be a mutant?

12:28.149 --> 12:29.315
Yeah...

12:29.715 --> 12:31.682
i don't know, i'm just searching
for any kind of connection.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.520
Well, adam keeps
all the hard-core genomex
data pretty encrypted.

12:34.555 --> 12:38.541
Think you can crack
the security system?

12:38.576 --> 12:42.528
What we got so far,
you better hope so.

12:42.563 --> 12:44.530
Yeah...

12:46.132 --> 12:50.136
somewhere along the line,
adam kane became a monster.

12:50.536 --> 12:55.741
He is personally responsible
for the creation of a seemingly

12:55.776 --> 12:59.710
endless stream
of deadly monstrosities.

12:59.745 --> 13:03.749
I fixed the genetic flaws that
were killing those children.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.970
You fixed them?

13:07.005 --> 13:09.981
You fixed them.

13:10.016 --> 13:12.923
Who did you fix?

13:12.958 --> 13:16.562
Did you fix michael ward?

13:16.962 --> 13:19.765
Is he one of your
crowning achievements?

13:20.166 --> 13:23.769
June 29 of
this year; the location;
a national park, upstate.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.557
I had nothing
to do with michael ward.

13:46.592 --> 13:50.596
Your technology created him
and when your mistake was about

13:50.631 --> 13:54.600
to become public, you and
your mutant army destroyed him.

14:01.006 --> 14:07.012
No. Michael, stop.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.380
Agghh!

14:09.415 --> 14:11.016
Agh. Agh...

14:11.051 --> 14:14.220
agh!

14:23.429 --> 14:27.833
Tell me, how many other
mistakes have you made?

14:28.234 --> 14:34.640
Why don't you show us
how you fixed lorna templeton?

14:36.642 --> 14:39.044
Tony, you don't want to do this.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.046
Come on, stop it.

14:41.447 --> 14:51.056
Think about
what it would be like to
live in a world without me.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.260
Oh... oh.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.467
Huh. That's impressive.

15:01.867 --> 15:06.471
But his most terrible
creation was the first,

15:06.506 --> 15:11.076
the one known as patient
zero, gabriel ashlocke.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.043
Enlighten us, adam.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.682
Show us how your monster
travelled back through time in

15:16.717 --> 15:19.485
order to brutally
murder his own parents.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.493
You see, ashlocke
was a killer's killer.

15:27.893 --> 15:32.698
He was more powerful than all
the rest, and completely insane.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.509
You just can't
stay away, can you?

15:43.544 --> 15:45.476
The links are mine.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.077
You think you
can break us apart?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.515
- And untold damage was
caused by mutants who fell under

15:49.550 --> 15:51.116
ashlocke's mental domination.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.519
Ashlocke's got him!

16:03.128 --> 16:04.330
Come on. Come
on, we gotta get out.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.931
<screaming> no, i can't.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.150
We gotta go. Come on.

16:07.185 --> 16:08.299
You have a choice.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.537
Everything's about to explode.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.941
Even then, when you realized
that he didn't fit in with your

16:16.342 --> 16:21.146
twisted plans,
you had him destroyed.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.751
Do it now. Do it.

16:25.786 --> 16:27.953
Ah, ugh... ugh.

16:28.354 --> 16:32.358
Ah... ah...!

16:43.168 --> 16:45.971
All right. Now, now, now, now.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.973
We're not finished...

16:48.008 --> 16:51.577
...agh...!

16:57.182 --> 17:01.952
All of this in
the name of science.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.991
Or was it simply a string
of terrible crimes that mankind

17:06.026 --> 17:09.960
need never have seen?

17:09.994 --> 17:13.964
A confession would
make things easier.

17:13.999 --> 17:18.368
Otherwise, as you know,
we have lots more to see.

17:18.404 --> 17:22.007
Your honour, i would like
to request a recess so that my

17:22.041 --> 17:24.410
client may reconsider.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.613
Granted.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.822
Do something. Help me.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.433
This isn't gonna work.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.870
Adam's encryption system's
beyond military grade.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.673
It's a holographic a. i. System.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.240
Which means...?

17:56.275 --> 17:58.677
Which means, basically
you gotta be him to get in.

17:58.712 --> 18:01.080
We gotta face it
- we're screwed, brennan.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.082
We gotta find a way, man.

18:03.117 --> 18:06.685
What'd you do?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.453
Nothing.

18:09.488 --> 18:13.857
You were looking for me.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.295
You were the guy that
adam was supposed to meet.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.896
Stay out of this.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.699
Sending my genetic code
out on a search engine puts

18:21.100 --> 18:22.666
all of us in jeopardy.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.703
Adam wouldn't even be missing
if you didn't set up the meet.

18:25.104 --> 18:25.869
You have to help us.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.906
I don't have to do anything.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.274
<sighs>

18:30.309 --> 18:34.713
66 industry avenue. One hour.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.315
Okay, come on.
- Yeah.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.327
You know, as a
defence attorney you leave
something to be desired.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.729
And what do you expect?

18:51.130 --> 18:55.534
I can't exactly argue with
images from your own memory.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.553
They've taken
them out of context.

18:57.588 --> 18:59.538
Who's ever trying
to destroy me has...

18:59.573 --> 19:00.704
has orchestrated this.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.107
They've taken specific
dates and specific times,

19:03.142 --> 19:06.745
they've fed them to warren to
make me look as bad as possible.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.712
We witnessed the abominations.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.150
Look, there are many people
living productive lives out

19:11.550 --> 19:14.718
there who wouldn't
be there if it wasn't for me.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.556
Okay, and what about the crimes
committed by your mutants?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.123
My mutants.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.560
You make it sound like
they're my science project.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.180
They're human beings.
They have free will.

19:24.215 --> 19:26.765
I am not responsible
for their moral choices.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.533
You have to
believe me about this.

19:29.568 --> 19:33.572
Well, see, it doesn't make
any difference if you believe me

19:33.607 --> 19:37.576
or not because the whole
trial is a setup, isn't it?

19:37.976 --> 19:43.982
All right.
But tell me something:
Did you go to law school?

19:44.383 --> 19:46.785
Did you believe in justice?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.153
I mean, isn't that
why you went to law school?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
How can you divorce what
you're doing here from what you

19:51.225 --> 19:53.192
actually believe in?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.193
See, you're a good person.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.760
I don't think you can.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.797
When i was offered this
position, it was to be a part of

19:59.198 --> 20:01.565
ridding the world
of our worst nightmares.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.368
Janet, our worst nightmares
are running this trial.

20:04.403 --> 20:08.407
And doesn't the possibility of
that scare the hell out of you?

20:08.807 --> 20:11.175
Give me a chance
to prove myself, please.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.413
If you still believe in
justice, just give me that shot.

20:14.448 --> 20:17.834
Check out the government
agency called genomex.

20:17.869 --> 20:21.220
You'll find everything
you want right there.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.423
Please.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.638
You know, why is it, that
anonymous callers never want to

20:39.673 --> 20:41.857
meet in a nice warm starbuck's?

20:41.892 --> 20:44.007
Aw, i don't like it either.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.644
If this is the
guy that set adam up,

20:45.679 --> 20:47.246
we could be walking
right into a trap.

20:47.281 --> 20:48.447
Yeah, well, what's our option?

20:48.847 --> 20:50.849
You know, trap or
not, it's our only hope.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.416
Geez.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.052
Okay, how about a
little warning next time?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.254
Sorry.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.656
Got here a few minutes ago.
Decided to check the place out.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.223
Any sign of marsden?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.860
Well, there's definitely
somebody inside,

21:01.895 --> 21:04.463
but i couldn't
get an exact fix on it.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.688
That's far enough.

21:32.891 --> 21:34.893
Show yourself.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.663
That's him.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.700
Okay, tell us where adam is.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.505
When you're in
someone else's space it's
wise not to make demands.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.071
I've had enough of this.

21:48.106 --> 21:51.710
There are tracking
missiles at the other
end of each of those lasers.

21:51.745 --> 21:56.114
You don't think i've survived
forty years to be threatened

21:56.149 --> 22:00.118
by a bunch of
made-to-order super-kids?

22:00.153 --> 22:02.486
Even if you evade the missiles,

22:02.521 --> 22:06.124
there's still a score
of other traps in this building.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.091
Surprised you invited us.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.093
They tracked my
communication to adam.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.531
That means it's getting
too hot here anyway.

22:12.566 --> 22:14.898
This will be my last visit.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.336
So you intend to
kill us before you go?

22:22.140 --> 22:24.543
I just want to keep
you where i can see you.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.144
What about adam?

22:26.545 --> 22:30.148
You're too late. He's
in front of the tribunal.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.552
The people who really run
this country don't work through

22:33.587 --> 22:36.555
the legal system, but they
still recognize the need for

22:36.955 --> 22:40.158
rules, some structure as
to how they exert their will on

22:40.193 --> 22:44.928
world events, thus the tribunal.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.965
So why'd they set
their sights on adam?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.967
He has an enemy.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.571
Someone powerful enough to
have a voice even at that level.

22:52.606 --> 22:53.772
Who?

22:54.172 --> 22:55.374
Even i don't know that.

22:55.409 --> 22:56.975
Where is he?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.979
There is a decommissioned
missile silo 46 degrees,

23:01.380 --> 23:05.784
36 minutes north
latitude, 112 degrees,

23:06.184 --> 23:09.353
2 minutes west longitude.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.591
A cross band scanner
will guide you in.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.797
Okay, we're going in.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.198
Move, move, move.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.601
Move in.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.003
Bring 'em down on the wire.

23:39.017 --> 23:41.019
Jesse, take care of marsden.

23:41.054 --> 23:43.021
We'll take care of the rest.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.035
Hey, buddy, over here.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.415
He got away.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.252
He must have had over
twenty ways out of here.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.254
Let's go find adam.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.425
Your honour, during the
recess i had the opportunity to

24:21.460 --> 24:26.264
review new information
regarding dr. Kane
and his genetic therapies.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.468
And it is at this time that
i would like to request that

24:29.503 --> 24:33.036
this information
be submitted as evidence.

24:33.071 --> 24:37.441
Ms. Nicholls, what is
the source of your evidence?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.278
Through safe channels i was
able to access files from the

24:40.679 --> 24:43.882
genomex corporation, the
site where much of his genetic

24:43.917 --> 24:46.650
experimentation was conducted.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.888
Your honour, these files
are unreliable and prejudicial.

24:49.923 --> 24:53.091
Genomex was a rogue corporation
that made common practice of

24:53.126 --> 24:55.894
misrepresenting its activities.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.861
A man's life is at stake.

24:57.896 --> 25:00.699
All evidence
should be scrutinized.

25:01.099 --> 25:02.300
This is absurd, your honour.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.920
Enough, mr. Warren.

25:04.955 --> 25:07.506
The bench will confer.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.709
I hope you understand
what you're doing.

25:14.312 --> 25:17.515
Defence, your request is denied.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.719
Mr. Warren, you may proceed.

25:20.754 --> 25:22.686
Thank you, your honour.

25:22.721 --> 25:26.725
Let's move on to the matter
of mutant x. Brennan mulwray,

25:26.760 --> 25:31.129
shalimar fox, jesse
kilmartin and emma delauro...

25:31.530 --> 25:35.534
four of mr. Kane's most powerful
mutant creations assembled

25:35.569 --> 25:39.137
in one terrorist band,
committing criminal acts across

25:39.172 --> 25:42.741
the country in
support of his agenda.

25:42.776 --> 25:45.143
Specifics, mr. Warren.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.911
October 15 last year.

25:47.946 --> 25:52.350
Brennan mulwray and his
associates, robbing a bank,

25:52.385 --> 25:56.319
using his powers to
disable the alarm system,

25:56.354 --> 26:03.161
mulwray broke into the
most secure vault in the state.

26:19.978 --> 26:23.982
Mulwray's target was over
$10 million in negotiable bonds.

26:24.382 --> 26:25.549
Hah.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.951
He was successful in the theft.

26:27.986 --> 26:33.592
Just one episode in
an extended life of crime.

26:33.627 --> 26:35.559
The others?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.396
Mutant x broke into a top
secret nuclear facility where

26:38.431 --> 26:41.199
jesse kilmartin used his
mutant powers to steal deadly

26:41.234 --> 26:43.602
fissionable material.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.012
In tandem with another terrorist
group, mutant x murdered

26:54.047 --> 26:57.215
government agents
guarding the installation.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.018
We're under attack.

27:00.418 --> 27:02.020
Call it in.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.444
As you clearly see,
dr. Kane's memories

27:26.845 --> 27:28.847
show kilmartin stealing
the deadly materiai...

27:28.882 --> 27:30.413
- no.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.652
...which was later sold
to international terrorists.

27:33.687 --> 27:38.021
Also that year, mr. Kane's
entire strike force

27:38.056 --> 27:40.859
was involved in an illegal
operation in a foreign country.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.425
Huh...

27:42.460 --> 27:44.462
what... what
are you talking about?

27:44.497 --> 27:47.666
July 12, also of this year.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.470
Mr. Kane's
team entered kavakistan
in order to steal a weapon

27:52.505 --> 27:56.474
of mass destruction
in the middle of a war zone.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.888
Get down.

28:09.923 --> 28:12.090
Go, get...

28:12.490 --> 28:14.092
agh...

28:14.893 --> 28:18.496
come on.

28:18.531 --> 28:22.100
Go. Go.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.506
Stop. Stop.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.710
Here, let me help.

28:31.745 --> 28:33.128
No. Go.

28:33.163 --> 28:34.512
Got it?

28:35.714 --> 28:38.116
Where are we going?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.319
They're right on
our heels. We gotta go.

28:41.354 --> 28:43.722
All right. Here goes nothing.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.089
Looks like government aircraft.

28:46.124 --> 28:50.128
Two planes and
they're headed this way.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.534
They moved their hostile
actions from ground to air,

28:56.569 --> 28:58.937
engaging two government jets.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.539
Jets approaching.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.058
They're on us.

29:03.093 --> 29:04.542
Missiles, lookout.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.160
They're coming back at us.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.527
They have missile lock.

29:24.562 --> 29:26.564
I'm not going to
be able to do that again.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.967
Jesse, you have
to phase the helix.

29:29.002 --> 29:30.168
I can't do that.

29:30.568 --> 29:31.770
Well, we don't
have any other choice.

29:31.805 --> 29:32.988
Just do it.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.137
You can try.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.773
Jesse, you have to.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.592
We don't have a choice.

29:37.627 --> 29:39.377
They're getting closer.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.590
Agh! Agh!

29:52.625 --> 29:56.594
Agh!

30:09.007 --> 30:11.009
Oh, a direct hit.

30:11.044 --> 30:12.210
Yes.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.013
At the same time they destroyed
several fighter jets of that

30:15.048 --> 30:18.581
country's legitimate government.

30:18.616 --> 30:23.421
Further evidence of his warlike
intent is hardly necessary.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.626
Are you okay?

30:28.661 --> 30:30.193
Oh, god.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.396
Please, please find out
who's feeding him these dates.

30:33.431 --> 30:36.234
These are things
that no one could know
about but my team and i.

30:36.269 --> 30:39.838
Warren is not going
to share that information.

30:39.873 --> 30:42.205
Try.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.043
It is at this time that
i would like to expose dr. Kane's

30:45.078 --> 30:47.811
most serious crimes,

30:47.846 --> 30:50.648
those that will
certainly seal his fate.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.870
The helix is
powered up and ready.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.272
Good. Any information on
the coordinates marsden gave us?

31:14.672 --> 31:17.074
Nothing on any commercial
or military flight plans,

31:17.109 --> 31:19.477
but satellite images
from midday yesterday showed

31:19.512 --> 31:21.444
some activity in the area.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.681
Okay, i'm going to
start an all-frequency scan.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.884
I should be able to
get a tighter lock to their

31:26.284 --> 31:29.087
communication channels
by the time we close
in on their location.

31:33.491 --> 31:37.095
And finally, what might be the
most damning evidence of all,

31:37.495 --> 31:41.899
proof of adam kane's plans
to overthrow world governments.

31:41.934 --> 31:46.269
Mutant x has never plotted
to overthrow any government.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.908
Only if
you don't consider attacking
sworn government agents

31:50.308 --> 31:53.912
engaged in their
official duties as treason.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.279
- Come on.

31:56.314 --> 32:01.519
These memories
are from a september
17 break-in at the gsa.

32:26.744 --> 32:30.748
Your team helped emma
delauro evade law enforcement

32:30.783 --> 32:34.752
officials intent
on bringing her to justice.

33:28.806 --> 33:32.810
And then
she becomes a key member of
his criminal organization.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.814
No need to run any more, emma.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.416
You're among friends.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.221
Now, your honour, there are
any number of further examples

33:43.256 --> 33:47.190
of damning proof that
adam kane could show here.

33:47.225 --> 33:51.629
But i feel
a representative picture
has already been painted.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.233
Now, i request that
you forego mr. Kane's right

33:55.268 --> 33:57.200
to speak in his own defence,

33:57.235 --> 34:04.442
and i ask you to
find him guilty as charged.

34:07.645 --> 34:11.614
You will have an opportunity
to state your defence.

34:11.649 --> 34:21.259
Be careful,
mr. Kane. What you say next
will determine your fate.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.665
On course.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.232
We've got a tailwind.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.467
It should get us
there a few minutes faster.

34:30.868 --> 34:33.271
Good. We're going to need
as much time as we can get.

34:36.474 --> 34:40.043
Mr. Kane. You may
proceed with your defence.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.681
Well, your honours, what
could i possibly tell you that

34:43.716 --> 34:46.849
would alter the
outcome of this trial?

34:46.884 --> 34:50.088
Now, i could tell you that
what you have seen today has not

34:50.487 --> 34:53.690
been the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.658
It's been half-truths.

34:55.693 --> 34:59.297
That images from my life have
been deliberately taken out of

34:59.697 --> 35:03.501
context by the
prosecution to portray me
as some sort of a criminal.

35:03.536 --> 35:07.305
As a terrorist
and my teammates as some
sort of genetic monsters.

35:07.340 --> 35:11.309
I will tell you this:
That the genetic therapies that

35:11.344 --> 35:14.877
i performed at genomex
saved hundreds of lives.

35:14.912 --> 35:18.716
And i will tell you that i
made mistakes, and that some of

35:18.751 --> 35:22.520
my patients
developed extraordinary
abilities that i could

35:22.920 --> 35:26.524
never have foreseen
and that these abilities have

35:26.924 --> 35:29.692
complicated their lives.

35:29.727 --> 35:34.131
But i will also tell you that,
if this were a real trial and

35:34.166 --> 35:37.752
i were allowed to really defend
myself, that we would invite

35:37.787 --> 35:41.339
those patients here and you
would hear the vast majority of

35:41.374 --> 35:43.741
them say "thank you"
for what i have done,

35:44.142 --> 35:46.109
which is to defend
them against the

35:46.144 --> 35:50.148
forces that would
exploit or eradicate them.

35:50.548 --> 35:52.550
Objection.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.552
Conjecture.

35:54.952 --> 35:58.556
Mr. Kane, you will confine
yourself to the facts.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.958
The so-called government
forces that the prosecution says

36:00.993 --> 36:03.761
that i tampered with,
that i... that i battled with?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.929
That was the genetic
security agency.

36:06.964 --> 36:10.933
It's a rogue agency whose
job it was to hunt down, to

36:10.968 --> 36:14.572
torture, and to murder these
specially gifted human beings.

36:14.972 --> 36:16.139
Objection.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.740
Let the man speak.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.742
All right, here's another fact.

36:19.777 --> 36:22.180
The team of brave young
people that i work with called

36:22.215 --> 36:25.348
mutant x have saved
hundreds of their lives.

36:25.383 --> 36:29.752
Yeah, but you were not allowed
to see those images today

36:29.787 --> 36:33.791
because the prosecution
chose not to show
your honours those images.

36:33.826 --> 36:36.194
And why is that?

36:36.594 --> 36:39.397
Well, because
this trial's a joke.

36:39.797 --> 36:42.565
Right?

36:42.600 --> 36:48.571
It's a sham. And
i still don't know why.

36:48.606 --> 36:52.210
Is it really about some sort
of an elaborate revenge that is

36:52.610 --> 36:57.014
orchestrated against me
by enemies whose names i'm not

36:57.415 --> 36:59.382
allowed to know?

36:59.417 --> 37:06.624
But i will tell you this:
That i'm extremely proud of what

37:06.659 --> 37:10.845
my teammates and i have
accomplished, and that i face

37:10.880 --> 37:15.032
whatever verdict you send
down with something that you

37:15.067 --> 37:19.254
justices may never again enjoy:

37:19.289 --> 37:23.441
A conscience, which is clear.

37:36.654 --> 37:43.861
Mr. Kane, we shall confer
and return with our verdict.

37:57.475 --> 37:59.041
Stealth mode is activated.

37:59.076 --> 38:01.478
We are now invisible
to all scanning spectrums.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.881
Target's dead ahead
and we are locked on to the

38:03.916 --> 38:05.448
installation's heat signature.

38:05.483 --> 38:08.286
Emma, when we get a visual,
see if you can find an entrance.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.688
Will do.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.090
I'm bringing us in.

38:38.716 --> 38:42.285
This panel has
reached its decision.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.324
Adam kane, you have
been found guilty as charged.

38:46.359 --> 38:50.328
Your execution is
to be ordered without delay.

39:15.786 --> 39:18.989
Mr. Kane, prepare
yourself for execution.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.363
Well, if you could
contact my friends.

39:27.398 --> 39:30.601
Let them know they
were in my final thoughts.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.035
Emma, don't! She's on our side.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.637
Help me out.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.241
Well, talk about
waiting to the last minute.

40:10.276 --> 40:12.243
We got here
as quick as we could.

40:12.278 --> 40:13.409
Thanks.

40:13.444 --> 40:14.645
We should get
the hell out of here.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.047
No, no. Wait! There's
something i need to know.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.666
Bring him here.

40:18.701 --> 40:20.076
What the hell?

40:20.111 --> 40:21.452
You can't do this!

40:21.852 --> 40:23.018
You can't get away with this!

40:23.053 --> 40:25.421
Just consider
this part of my defence.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.057
I want to know who gave
you your information about me.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.860
No. I can't.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.263
You can't?

40:32.298 --> 40:33.464
No.

40:33.864 --> 40:37.868
Believe me, you will.

40:37.903 --> 40:42.673
Who set me up?

40:51.482 --> 40:52.883
It can't be.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.285
He's back.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.488
Who is it, adam?

40:57.523 --> 41:00.291
Mason eckhart.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.097
All right. Let's go.

41:18.709 --> 41:21.111
I can't believe
he's still out there.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.078
Well, he's out there all right.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.516
And he was able to tell warren
everything we've done minute

41:25.551 --> 41:27.883
by minute since we last saw him.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.721
You think his organization
is still intact?

41:30.756 --> 41:33.123
Well, he didn't
accomplish that alone.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.725
So what are you going to do?

41:35.125 --> 41:36.692
Just wait for him
to make another move?

41:36.727 --> 41:39.129
I say we hunt that psychopath
down and put him away for good.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.696
Yeah, he was in a pod.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.298
I thought that was already done.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.335
Well, should've known
a pod wouldn't hold him.

41:44.735 --> 41:47.938
Now we all have to
face the grim fact our worst

41:47.973 --> 41:50.306
enemy is out there again.

41:50.341 --> 41:55.145
He's not going to
rest until we're all dead.
