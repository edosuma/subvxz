00:43.300 --> 00:45.338
Is there any news of Sybil?

00:45.343 --> 00:48.578
She's still not coming.
She insists they can't afford it.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.580
Mr Travis, can we move forward?

00:51.140 --> 00:53.940
If I could just ask you to
come down the aisle again?

00:55.220 --> 00:57.220
Can we get the troops organised?

00:57.300 --> 00:59.300
That means me.

00:59.620 --> 01:03.218
It seems rather hard on poor old
Travis when he's doing all the work,

01:03.223 --> 01:05.058
but the Archbishop gets the glory.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.458
Papa was the one who wanted
a prince of the church.

01:07.463 --> 01:09.218
I'd have settled for Travis.

01:09.223 --> 01:12.458
Is there really no way we can get Sybil over?
It seems ridiculous.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.618
On the contrary, it's a relief.

01:14.623 --> 01:18.138
Branson is still an object
of fascination for the county.

01:18.143 --> 01:22.500
We'll ask him here when we can prepare
the servants and manage it gently.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.898
He's making a problem
where none exists.

01:24.903 --> 01:28.060
No-one could care less whether
Branson's at the wedding or not.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.818
You must think country life
more exciting than it is

01:30.823 --> 01:34.978
if you imagine people don't care when an
earl's daughter runs off with the chauffeur.

01:34.983 --> 01:38.738
She has run off with the chauffeur
and they'll have to get used to it.

01:38.743 --> 01:42.780
Mr Travis, are we ready?
- Any moment, Your Grace. Any moment.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.220
Can we...
Please.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.018
That treacle tart just hit the spot.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.858
So, Mrs Hughes and Anna
are getting the place ready to let?

02:05.863 --> 02:07.698
That is the plan.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.979
I'm surprised Anna held on
to that house.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.098
I thought they'd confiscated
the profits of murder.

02:13.103 --> 02:16.258
Mr Bates had the wisdom to transfer
it to her before the trial.

02:16.263 --> 02:18.218
I don't think I'd have allowed it.

02:18.223 --> 02:21.020
Then we must be grateful
you were not the presiding judge.

02:21.540 --> 02:25.538
I still think it's funny, given
that he's a convicted murderer.

02:25.543 --> 02:29.298
May I remind you, Mr Barrow, that in
this house Mr Bates is a wronged man

02:29.303 --> 02:32.858
seeking justice. If you have
any problems with that definition,

02:32.863 --> 02:34.860
I suggest you eat in the yard.

02:42.100 --> 02:46.340
I suppose you agree with Robert.
- Not for the first time, you suppose wrongly.

02:47.860 --> 02:51.498
The family must never
be a topic of conversation.

02:51.503 --> 02:54.778
I'm afraid Sybil's already made
the Crawleys a permanent topic.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.818
All the more reason.

02:56.823 --> 02:59.138
If we can show the county
he can behave normally,

02:59.143 --> 03:01.018
they will soon lose interest in him.

03:01.023 --> 03:03.618
And I shall make sure
he behaves normally

03:03.623 --> 03:06.860
because I shall hold his hand
on the radiator until he does.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.858
I don't know this young man aside
from 'Good morning' and 'Good night',

03:10.863 --> 03:14.458
but he strikes me as a very
interesting addition to the family.

03:14.463 --> 03:18.658
Oh, here we go.
- And why should he be normal as you call it?

03:18.663 --> 03:21.818
I say he should come here
and fight his corner.

03:21.823 --> 03:23.940
I like a man of strong beliefs.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.938
I think I'll send them the money.

03:26.943 --> 03:30.660
Please don't. Robert's expressly
forbidden it. He'd be furious.

03:33.020 --> 03:34.860
But it can't be as bad as...

03:36.180 --> 03:38.940
Look, I'll come and see you,
tomorrow.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.380
No, I insist.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
Right. Goodbye.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.140
Papa...
What's the matter?

03:48.860 --> 03:51.660
Nothing's the matter.
What should be the matter?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.778
How was London?
- We got it all done.

04:00.783 --> 04:04.058
But I couldn't have managed without my helper.
- Have you eaten?

04:04.063 --> 04:05.818
We had a bite on the train.

04:05.823 --> 04:07.900
Well, sit down anyway.
Have a cup of tea.

04:08.460 --> 04:13.458
I'll start on the final list
for the wedding tomorrow morning.

04:13.463 --> 04:16.817
I've got the last of the wine
deliveries coming on Tuesday.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.938
How will you manage without a footman?
- I agree.

04:19.942 --> 04:21.898
But I haven't time to find one now.

04:21.903 --> 04:25.898
I've had a letter from my sister
asking after a job for her son and...

04:25.903 --> 04:29.378
Miss O'Brien, we are about to host
a society wedding.

04:29.383 --> 04:32.300
I have no time for training
young hobbledehoys.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.300
Her ladyship is ringing.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.658
Well, I don't see why not.

04:45.663 --> 04:48.538
I'll ask his lordship when...
There you are.

04:48.543 --> 04:50.938
So I'll ask you now.
- Ask me what?

04:50.943 --> 04:54.178
Carson's in need of a footman
and O'Brien has a candidate.

04:54.183 --> 04:57.018
Alfred. Alfred Nugent, my lord.
He's a good worker.

04:57.023 --> 04:59.020
I think it sounds perfect.

04:59.700 --> 05:04.138
Whatever you say. My dear,
I have to go up to London tomorrow.

05:04.143 --> 05:06.978
I'll be catching the early train.
- That's very sudden.

05:06.983 --> 05:10.058
Do you want them to open the house?
- No, I'll come straight back.

05:10.063 --> 05:13.100
What are you going for?
- It's nothing to bother you with.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.100
It's all there, every entry.

05:32.140 --> 05:35.178
Where did you find the book?
- Behind the bureau.

05:35.183 --> 05:37.380
We moved it out to clean
and there it was.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.498
Vera must have dropped it
or something.

05:40.503 --> 05:42.378
So what do you want me to do?

05:42.383 --> 05:44.380
Make notes on all the names.

05:44.940 --> 05:46.940
Close friend, relation.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.180
Workmate, tradesman, and so on.

05:49.380 --> 05:53.060
Then I'll copy those and I'll send
them with the book to Mr Murray.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.980
Haven't you anything better to do?
- I have not.

05:57.740 --> 06:01.551
Because I'd rather work to get you free than
dine with the King at Buckingham Palace.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.780
So what news have you got?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
What news could I have in here?

06:11.420 --> 06:13.378
Oh, I've acquired a new cellmate.

06:13.383 --> 06:15.380
To be honest,
I'm not sure about him.

06:16.820 --> 06:20.180
Well, just remember
what my mother used to say.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.700
Never make an enemy by accident.

06:24.340 --> 06:28.060
Now, do you think you can get the
notes done before my next visit?

06:29.340 --> 06:31.100
I don't see what can come of it.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.498
Probably nothing.

06:33.503 --> 06:35.898
And my next idea will probably lead
to nothing.

06:35.903 --> 06:37.900
And the next, and the next.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.780
But one day something will occur
to us.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.018
And we'll follow it up.

06:43.023 --> 06:45.140
And the case against you will crumble.

06:46.860 --> 06:50.580
Do you never doubt?
For just one minute.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.260
I wouldn't blame you.
- No.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.940
I don't doubt that the sun will rise
in the east either.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.380
You're too tall to be a footman.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.738
No footman should be over six foot one.

07:08.743 --> 07:11.940
That can't be, can it,
since he's already been taken on?

07:12.780 --> 07:14.990
Well, what have you done?
- I was a hotel waiter

07:15.090 --> 07:16.902
after I was
discharged from the army.

07:16.903 --> 07:21.340
But they've cut back.
- I think that shows real initiative.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.178
I suppose he can speak for himself.

07:24.183 --> 07:26.180
Why? Is he on trial?

07:26.820 --> 07:30.378
This isn't an interview, is it?
Not when he's already got the job.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.658
No, it is not an interview,
Miss O'Brien,

07:32.663 --> 07:35.858
but he is on trial
and if he cannot match our standards,

07:35.863 --> 07:38.738
he will be found guilty.
- I mean to try, Mr Carson.

07:38.743 --> 07:40.738
As long as you do.

07:40.743 --> 07:42.860
Right, go upstairs and get settled in.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.540
Your aunt will hopefully
find you a livery that fits.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.458
Just at the start, so we've a place
to sleep after the honeymoon.

07:56.463 --> 08:00.180
You can't object to that.
- No, it's nice of them.

08:00.580 --> 08:04.298
Though I doubt I'll get used to taking you
to bed with your father watching.

08:04.303 --> 08:08.458
He's so relieved we're getting married,
he wouldn't mind if you carried me up naked.

08:08.463 --> 08:10.460
Careful. I might try it.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.178
I don't want to move to London
or anything.

08:15.183 --> 08:17.578
I'm not kicking against the traces.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.378
Just testing their strengths.

08:19.383 --> 08:21.380
I want us to get to know each other.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.900
To learn about who we both are,
without everybody being there.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.698
Well, it's quite a big house.

08:28.703 --> 08:30.738
It's a lovely house.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.140
It's your home
and I want it to be my home too.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.700
Just not quite yet.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.666
Chancery Lane.
- Yes, sir.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.498
I've spoken to Frobisher and Curran

08:55.503 --> 08:59.258
and, since I am a trustee,
should the estate ever need one,

08:59.263 --> 09:01.380
we felt I ought to be the one
to tell you.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.898
You make it sound very serious.

09:03.903 --> 09:07.540
I'm expressing myself badly
if you think it is not serious.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.935
Why did we invest so much?

09:12.463 --> 09:15.378
Lord Grantham,
it was you who insisted we should.

09:15.383 --> 09:17.538
If you remember,
we advised against it.

09:17.543 --> 09:20.858
But war would mean a huge expansion
of railways everywhere.

09:20.863 --> 09:22.778
Every forecast was certain.

09:22.783 --> 09:25.338
Rail shares were bound
to make a fortune.

09:25.343 --> 09:28.858
Many did. But your principal holding,
which was very large indeed,

09:28.863 --> 09:31.538
was in the Canadian Grand Trunk Line.

09:31.543 --> 09:35.418
It was the main railway in British
North America, for God's sake.

09:35.423 --> 09:38.540
It wasn't just me.
Everyone said we couldn't lose.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.378
We knew hard times were coming
for estates like Downton

09:42.383 --> 09:45.418
and this investment would make it
safe for the rest of time.

09:45.423 --> 09:47.578
Charles Hays was the presiding genius

09:47.583 --> 09:50.020
and since he died,
the management has not...

09:51.020 --> 09:54.820
The fact is, the company
is about to be declared bankrupt.

09:55.140 --> 09:59.260
And the line will be absorbed into
the Canadian National Railways scheme.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.020
Are you really telling me
that all the money has gone?

10:07.180 --> 10:10.700
I'm afraid so.
- The lion's share of Cora's fortune?

10:20.540 --> 10:22.540
I won't give in, Murray.

10:23.420 --> 10:26.300
I've sacrificed too much to Downton
to give in now.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.978
I refuse to be the failure,

10:28.983 --> 10:32.298
the earl who dropped the torch
and let the flame go out.

10:32.303 --> 10:36.540
I hate to state the obvious,  but if there's
not enough money to run it...

10:37.180 --> 10:39.018
Downton must go.

10:39.023 --> 10:42.098
Unless you break it up
and sell it off piecemeal.

10:42.103 --> 10:46.460
I couldn't do that. I have a duty
beyond saving my own skin.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.738
The estate must be a major employer
and support the house

10:50.743 --> 10:53.100
or there's no po int to it.
To any of it.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.980
Morning.

11:03.986 --> 11:05.386
Lady Edith...

11:12.213 --> 11:14.213
Hello.

11:14.533 --> 11:18.051
What are you doing here?
- I'm meeting a train, but I'm too early.

11:18.056 --> 11:20.973
I mustn't hold you up.
- I'm not doing anything.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.733
I thought I'd get away
from wedding panic.

11:24.493 --> 11:27.773
Don't you like weddings?
- Don't be silly. Of course I do.

11:28.173 --> 11:31.491
Only I've talked of clothes
and flowers and food and guests

11:31.496 --> 11:33.493
until I'm blue in the face.

11:33.773 --> 11:37.453
Yes, weddings can be reminders
of one's loneliness, can't they?

11:37.973 --> 11:39.891
Sorry. I don't know why I said that.

11:39.896 --> 11:41.691
So, how's it going?

11:41.696 --> 11:43.641
Is your grandmother coming over
from New York for it?

11:43.641 --> 11:45.292
She is.

11:45.293 --> 11:47.331
And Sybil...
Is she here yet?

11:47.336 --> 11:50.691
As a matter of fact, she wasn't
coming. But I think she is now.

11:50.696 --> 11:52.531
Mary had a letter this morning.

11:52.536 --> 11:55.531
Papa doesn't know yet.
- He will be pleased.

11:55.536 --> 11:57.573
I do hope so.

11:59.213 --> 12:02.531
So you'll live at the big house
when you're back from honeymoon?

12:02.536 --> 12:04.533
Not live. Stay.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.413
We'll stay there until we decide
where to go.

12:07.773 --> 12:10.691
It'll be on the estate,
I should think, or in the village.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.693
Not here?
- No.

12:13.213 --> 12:16.573
But I shall expect you and Mrs Bird
to look after Mrs Crawley.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.413
You'll not be taking me with you, sir?

12:22.653 --> 12:27.013
Only I thought you'd be needing
a proper valet, once you're married.

12:27.973 --> 12:31.651
I've always thought of you as
a butler who helps out as a valet...

12:31.656 --> 12:34.571
not the other way round.
- I'd be happy to be a valet, sir.

12:34.576 --> 12:37.973
Especially in the big house.
-  We won't be at the big house for long.

12:38.613 --> 12:42.413
To be honest, Molesley, I want to
live more simply after the wedding.

12:43.733 --> 12:47.173
And besides,
Mother absolutely relies on you.

12:48.013 --> 12:50.613
Well, that's very nice to hear, sir.
Thank you.

12:52.653 --> 12:54.531
You must be exhausted, my lord.

12:54.536 --> 12:57.171
You can't have spent
more than two hours in London.

12:57.176 --> 13:01.093
It was sufficient.
- The new footman arrived while you were gone.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.611
What?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.893
Yes, he got the cable this morning
and came straight over.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.851
Very eager.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.771
And very tall.

13:11.776 --> 13:13.773
But when did...

13:14.093 --> 13:16.093
Never mind.

13:18.013 --> 13:20.171
Did you know about the new footman?

13:20.176 --> 13:22.173
Of course. He's already here.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.491
Why did no-one tell me?
- What do you mean?

13:25.496 --> 13:27.773
We talked about it last night.
In my room.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.451
Well, nobody else must be taken on.
Absolutely no-one.

13:31.456 --> 13:33.453
Until things are settled.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.653
What things?

13:36.013 --> 13:39.171
How's the wedding going?
I suppose it's costing the earth?

13:39.176 --> 13:41.491
Mary was never going to marry
on the cheap.

13:41.496 --> 13:44.333
Oh, no.
Nothing must be done on the cheap.

13:47.213 --> 13:49.051
I feel quite nervous.
- Don't be.

13:49.056 --> 13:51.611
You've got the skill
and you've got the willingness.

13:51.616 --> 13:53.851
But he hasn't got the experience.
- He's right.

13:53.856 --> 13:57.690
Pay no attention. You've a nice
manner. You're not vain like Thomas.

13:58.456 --> 14:00.453
They'll like that.

14:03.253 --> 14:05.211
What's the matter with you?
- I'm fed up.

14:05.216 --> 14:08.811
They promised me promotion.
She said they'd get a new kitchen maid

14:08.816 --> 14:10.611
and I'd be Mrs Patmore's assistant.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.371
If they promised,
you should withdraw your services.

14:13.376 --> 14:16.331
What do you mean? Like go on strike?

14:16.336 --> 14:18.333
But don't say I put you up to it.

14:21.813 --> 14:25.371
But what was in the letter?
- Just that Sybil's coming after all.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.491
She'll be here on Wednesday
for dinner.

14:27.496 --> 14:31.013
Will she be coming alone?
- Don't make trouble, Mother.

14:32.293 --> 14:35.453
Can I do it?
- If you wish, my lady. Of course.

14:36.213 --> 14:40.333
Are you really that tall?
- Yes, my lady.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.573
I thought you might have been
walking on stilts.

14:44.853 --> 14:46.771
When does Grandmama arrive?

14:46.776 --> 14:50.331
She gets into Liverpool on the 15th
the day before the wedding.

14:50.336 --> 14:52.971
I'm so looking forward
to seeing your mother again.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.773
When I'm with her I'm reminded
of the virtues of the English.

14:57.253 --> 14:59.893
But isn't she American?
- Exactly.

15:00.613 --> 15:02.491
Can I help myself?

15:02.496 --> 15:04.411
You want to as well, my lord?

15:04.416 --> 15:07.813
To be honest, I think you'll find
that we all do it as well.

15:08.693 --> 15:11.933
What do you think you're doing?
You're not in a hotel now.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.451
Did you train in a hotel?

15:16.456 --> 15:18.453
I did, ma'am.

15:18.893 --> 15:21.013
That will be useful.
Won't it, Carson?

15:22.733 --> 15:24.771
Are you all set for the wedding?

15:24.776 --> 15:28.053
Of course he is.
Carson's motto is, be prepared.

15:28.293 --> 15:30.813
I'm afraid Baden-Powell
has stolen it.

15:31.133 --> 15:33.133
But you have all the help you need?

15:33.453 --> 15:36.933
Well, I wouldn't fight the idea
of a second footman, my lady.

15:38.733 --> 15:42.811
I sometimes think it's time we lived
in a simpler way.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.171
I agree. Much cattle, much care.

15:45.176 --> 15:47.251
Always supposing we have the choice.

15:47.256 --> 15:50.813
Oh, don't say that.
It's our job to provide employment.

15:51.293 --> 15:53.371
An aristocrat with no servants

15:53.376 --> 15:56.133
is as much use to the county
as a glass hammer.

15:58.653 --> 16:02.611
I knew this would happen. Typical.
- What's typical?

16:02.616 --> 16:06.531
That I'd wind up looking after Mr Matthew.
That's all I need.

16:06.536 --> 16:10.093
He hasn't thought it through.
I'm sorry to say, but he hasn't.

16:10.173 --> 16:12.611
Are you worried for your job,
Mr Molesley?

16:12.616 --> 16:14.371
Me? Oh, heavens, no.

16:14.376 --> 16:17.771
No, no, no, I'm essential
to Mrs Crawley. She relies on me.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.531
That's what he said.
Essential.

16:20.536 --> 16:23.813
Oh, yes, we're all essential.
Until we get sacked.

16:24.973 --> 16:28.811
How was it?
- Alfred was confused.

16:28.816 --> 16:32.093
He thought he'd been transported
to the Hotel Metropole.

16:32.893 --> 16:35.091
Cheer up. You'll get the hang of it.

16:35.096 --> 16:39.811
Will I?
- Oh, you're still here, Mr Molesley.

16:39.816 --> 16:42.931
I know. I only walked over
for a cup of tea and a chat.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.251
But I've outstayed my welcome.
- Nonsense.

16:45.256 --> 16:47.211
Why not have a bite with us?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.811
They won't be leaving
for a half hour or more.

16:49.816 --> 16:52.531
No, I'd better get back.
I wouldn't want them to get home

16:52.536 --> 16:55.373
and me not be there to let them in.
- No, you wouldn't.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.973
Not when you're essential.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.331
Then why is he coming all the way here?

17:01.336 --> 17:04.411
Why not say it on the telephone?
- I have no idea.

17:04.415 --> 17:07.090
If Mr Swire's lawyer
wants to see you and it's urgent,

17:07.096 --> 17:09.330
it means he's left you something.
- I doubt it.

17:09.336 --> 17:11.211
I would have heard long before this.

17:11.215 --> 17:14.171
Anyway, I hope not.
- Why?

17:14.175 --> 17:16.371
Matthew. Do come on.

17:16.376 --> 17:18.693
The chauffeur's freezing to death
and so am I.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.330
Are you looking forward to the wedding?

17:23.336 --> 17:25.333
What do you think?

17:25.893 --> 17:28.093
I'm looking forward
to all sorts of things.

17:28.492 --> 17:31.093
Don't make me blush.
- Matthew.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.453
Dearest Papa.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.893
Tell me, did you send the money?

18:09.173 --> 18:12.011
Please say yes.
- What money?

18:12.016 --> 18:14.013
Hello, Tom.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.093
Welcome to Downton.

18:16.253 --> 18:19.933
I hope I am welcome, your ladyship.
- Of course.

18:20.813 --> 18:23.813
Alfred, would you take the luggage
for Mr Branson?

18:24.733 --> 18:26.533
There's tea in the library.

18:27.453 --> 18:29.453
Thank you.

18:37.973 --> 18:39.973
Hello, Mr Carson.

18:47.853 --> 18:51.651
Is that Mr Charkham I saw leaving?
- Yes.

18:51.656 --> 18:54.851
He said to make his apologies.
He was late for his train.

18:54.856 --> 18:56.853
What did he have to say for himself?

18:57.853 --> 18:59.853
I don't know where to start.

18:59.933 --> 19:05.213
Basically, it seems that Reggie Swire
did not wish to divide his fortune.

19:06.133 --> 19:09.891
So when Lavinia died, he made a new
will with a list of three heirs,

19:09.896 --> 19:12.213
of which I was the third.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.691
Why didn't the first name succeed?

19:15.696 --> 19:17.693
He died before Reggie.

19:17.893 --> 19:20.413
In the same epidemic that killed Lavinia.

19:20.853 --> 19:25.131
But at first they thought that the
second heir, a Mr Clive Pullbrook,

19:25.136 --> 19:27.133
would be easy to trace.

19:27.413 --> 19:29.413
How much money are we talking about?

19:30.173 --> 19:32.173
A lot.

19:32.453 --> 19:34.453
A huge amount. I had no idea.

19:34.733 --> 19:37.531
You could never have told it
from Reggie's way of life.

19:37.536 --> 19:39.533
Lucky Mr Pullbrook.

19:40.093 --> 19:42.093
This is it.

19:42.493 --> 19:45.011
Some time before Reggie's death,

19:45.016 --> 19:46.971
Pullbrook travelled to the East,

19:46.976 --> 19:49.813
to India, to some tea plantations
he owned there.

19:51.493 --> 19:54.651
And?
- He's never been heard of since.

19:54.656 --> 19:58.693
They've made enquiries. They've sent
an agent out to visit his property.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.133
There's no sign of him.

20:02.613 --> 20:05.293
I'm sorry. I won't. And that's flat.

20:05.733 --> 20:07.731
Then you'll have to do it,
Mr Carson.

20:07.736 --> 20:09.851
I'm not dressing a chauffeur.

20:09.856 --> 20:11.811
He is not a chauffeur now.

20:11.816 --> 20:13.771
Anyway, you don't have to dress him,

20:13.776 --> 20:16.051
just see he's got everything
he needs.

20:16.056 --> 20:20.251
I'm not often as one with Mr Barrow,
but no.

20:20.256 --> 20:22.691
Then Alfred must do it.
- Alfred?

20:22.696 --> 20:26.131
He wouldn't know what to do
beyond collecting dirty shoes.

20:26.136 --> 20:28.133
Well, he'll have to learn.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.709
Is it an Irish tradition?

20:35.789 --> 20:37.726
What?
- She means not changing.

20:37.826 --> 20:40.321
Of course it isn't, Granny.
- It might have been.

20:40.809 --> 20:43.644
You don't change on the first night
of a voyage.

20:43.649 --> 20:46.004
No, my lady,
I don't own a set of tails

20:46.009 --> 20:49.324
or a dinner jacket either.
I wouldn't get any use out of them.

20:49.329 --> 20:52.284
Well, I hope you own a morning coat
since you're here for a wedding.

20:52.889 --> 20:57.004
No, I'm afraid I don't.
- We live a different kind of life, Papa.

20:57.009 --> 20:59.006
Obviously.

20:59.246 --> 21:01.646
Could you lower it a bit, please,
Mr Carson?

21:03.646 --> 21:06.284
You should buy a Downton wardrobe
and leave it here.

21:06.289 --> 21:07.995
Then you won't have to pack
when you come.

21:08.095 --> 21:09.495
What a good idea.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.644
I'm afraid I can't turn into
somebody else just to please you.

21:12.649 --> 21:16.564
More's the pity.
- Oh, no, why should you change to please us?

21:16.569 --> 21:18.684
What is the general feeling
in Ireland now?

21:18.689 --> 21:20.623
That we're in sight of throwing off
the English yoke.

21:20.723 --> 21:23.248
Do you approve of the new act?

21:23.249 --> 21:26.204
Would you of your country
being divided by a foreign power?

21:26.209 --> 21:29.244
Well, won't it bring home rule
for Southern Ireland nearer?

21:29.249 --> 21:32.164
Home rule on English terms
presided over by an English king.

21:32.169 --> 21:34.004
Is keeping the monarchy a problem?

21:34.009 --> 21:37.326
Would it be a problem for you
to be ruled by the German Kaiser?

21:39.686 --> 21:41.724
Carson, are you all right?

21:41.729 --> 21:44.604
I've been very clumsy, my lord.
I do apologise.

21:44.609 --> 21:49.109
Is it true that Irish gardens
have more variety than ours?

21:49.209 --> 21:53.484
Oh, yes. Don't you remember
Lady Dufferin's ball at Claneboye?

21:53.489 --> 21:55.446
The gardens there were heavenly.

21:58.006 --> 22:01.444
I thought them very down on him.
- That is because you know nothing.

22:01.449 --> 22:03.364
And wasn't he down on them,

22:03.369 --> 22:06.244
insulting our country,
insulting the King?

22:06.249 --> 22:09.084
I thought it was a miracle
his lordship held his temper.

22:09.089 --> 22:11.444
But it must be hard, Mr Carson.

22:11.449 --> 22:15.326
To sit up there
with people he used to drive around.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.166
It is hard, Mrs Hughes.

22:19.486 --> 22:21.524
Please, sit down.

22:21.529 --> 22:23.526
Is there something we can do, sir?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.084
I just wanted to come down
to say hello.

22:27.089 --> 22:29.638
I wouldn't want you to think I'd got
too big for my boots.

22:29.738 --> 22:31.606
That's nice.

22:32.606 --> 22:34.644
I hope you and Lady Sybil are well?

22:34.649 --> 22:36.644
We are. Thank you.

22:36.649 --> 22:39.044
And we've been following
the story of Mr Bates.

22:39.049 --> 22:40.806
Mary keeps us informed.

22:43.206 --> 22:45.926
Still, I mustn't interrupt your dinner.

22:46.326 --> 22:48.326
Thank you for coming down.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.004
He's settled into his new life.

22:56.009 --> 22:58.284
Mary keeps us informed.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.764
Well, he knows her now.
- What's that got to do with it?

23:01.769 --> 23:05.446
His lordship would never call her
Mary when talking to me. Never.

23:06.686 --> 23:10.166
If he wants to play their game,
he'd better learn their rules.

23:11.806 --> 23:14.924
Tomorrow let's ask the servants
to come up and dine with us

23:14.929 --> 23:16.884
to make things easier.

23:16.889 --> 23:20.524
You must get him to stop calling
Granny 'my lady'. And Mama.

23:20.529 --> 23:24.324
We need something that doesn't sound
too stiff and grand.

23:24.329 --> 23:26.326
Lady Grantham, of course.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.806
And he can call me Lord Grantham.

23:30.006 --> 23:32.486
That doesn't sound stiff or grand
at all.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.846
One step at a time.

23:39.606 --> 23:42.524
So what did the lawyer want?
I presume he turned up.

23:42.529 --> 23:45.246
He did, and it's rather complicated.

23:45.806 --> 23:48.406
But you were right.
It was about Reggie's will.

23:48.486 --> 23:50.604
So he's left you something?

23:50.609 --> 23:53.884
Never mind that now. Sit down
and tell me about the relations

23:53.889 --> 23:57.686
that are coming for the wedding.
I want to unscramble them in my head.

23:58.006 --> 24:01.686
Go to bed when you're done.
- I'll go to bed when I'm ready.

24:02.646 --> 24:06.324
What's happened to you? Have you
swapped places with your evil twin?

24:06.329 --> 24:09.764
I'd like to know where the new maid
is. That's what you promised.

24:09.769 --> 24:11.764
They've got a footman.
Where's the maid?

24:11.769 --> 24:14.924
I know and I'm sorry,
but I spoke to Mr Carson tonight

24:14.929 --> 24:17.204
and they won't be taking
anyone new on.

24:17.209 --> 24:21.204
Except a footman.
- I don't know how Mr Carson managed it

24:21.209 --> 24:23.444
because his lordship's put his foot down.

24:23.449 --> 24:27.564
But you're called my assistant now and
you've seven shillings extra every month.

24:27.569 --> 24:30.644
You've still kept me here
with a dishonest representation.

24:30.649 --> 24:33.606
Oh, dear.
Have you swallowed a dictionary?

24:36.846 --> 24:39.966
Somehow none of it seems to matter
when we're in Dublin.

24:40.406 --> 24:42.726
Class and all that
just seems to fade away.

24:43.646 --> 24:47.526
I'm Mrs Branson and we get on with
our lives like millions of others.

24:48.206 --> 24:50.206
But here he feels so patronised.

24:50.966 --> 24:54.364
And he hates it.
- But you don't regret it?

24:54.369 --> 24:56.366
No, never.

24:57.206 --> 24:59.206
He's a wonderful, wonderful man.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.604
I just wish you knew him.

25:01.609 --> 25:03.484
Darling, we will know him.

25:03.489 --> 25:05.686
We'll know him and value him.
I promise.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.406
Anyway...

25:10.286 --> 25:14.046
I'd best go upstairs
and make sure he's not too suicidal.

25:14.406 --> 25:16.406
Good night.

25:16.686 --> 25:19.484
Oh, by the way,
I don't know if Mama's told you...

25:19.489 --> 25:22.406
But the whole Grey family's
coming tomorrow night.

25:23.646 --> 25:25.646
Including Larry?

25:26.286 --> 25:28.286
Crikey.
- You'd better warn Tom.

25:29.286 --> 25:33.486
Oh, and, Sybil, I wouldn't tell Papa
about being Mrs Branson.

25:39.086 --> 25:40.924
But who are the Greys?

25:40.929 --> 25:43.084
And why does it matter
that they're coming?

25:43.089 --> 25:45.444
The father, Lord Merton,
is Mary's godfather.

25:45.449 --> 25:48.764
But Larry Grey used to be keen on me,
when we were young.

25:48.769 --> 25:50.804
Were you keen on him?

25:50.809 --> 25:52.806
No. I don't think so.

25:53.606 --> 25:55.606
I can hardly remember, to be honest.

25:55.886 --> 25:59.886
So what are you saying?
Nothing particularly.

26:00.606 --> 26:03.684
But we could run into Ripon
and find some tails.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.684
We have the money.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.686
I won't spend more of that money.

26:08.806 --> 26:10.806
All right.

26:11.646 --> 26:14.166
Please don't talk about Ireland
all the time.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.886
I just want to make things easier
for you.

26:18.486 --> 26:20.486
For me or for you?

26:20.846 --> 26:22.846
Don't disappoint me, Sybil.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.166
Not now that we're here.

26:34.566 --> 26:36.444
Shall I order the car?

26:36.449 --> 26:38.564
I don't think
I can refuse a lift with Mother

26:38.569 --> 26:40.844
and then make the poor man
go out again.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.846
I'll walk.
- It might rain.

26:43.486 --> 26:45.286
Then I'll get wet.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.606
Now come and kiss me.

26:52.326 --> 26:56.684
So, if they can't find Mr Pillbox,
what will you do with the money?

26:56.689 --> 26:59.446
Pullbrook. And they will find him.

27:00.246 --> 27:02.446
But if they don't?

27:03.086 --> 27:05.286
Then I'll decide what to do.

27:06.006 --> 27:08.006
Or we will.

27:10.926 --> 27:14.766
Because I can't keep it.
- No, of course not.

27:18.286 --> 27:22.206
Why have you so heavily invested in
one enterprise? Wasn't it foolish?

27:22.606 --> 27:25.446
Has some of my fortune been lost?

27:26.926 --> 27:28.926
Some.

27:30.446 --> 27:32.364
All.

27:32.369 --> 27:34.366
Almost all.

27:42.086 --> 27:44.086
Oh, my dear.

27:49.806 --> 27:51.806
How terrible for you.

27:52.646 --> 27:54.764
It's not so good for you.

27:54.769 --> 27:58.246
Don't worry about me. I'm an
American. Have gun, will travel.

28:00.606 --> 28:02.966
Thank god for you, anyway.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.086
You know what?

28:09.766 --> 28:11.966
I'm glad we have a wedding to celebrate.

28:13.766 --> 28:15.766
Let's make sure it's a great day.

28:19.246 --> 28:22.246
If it's to be our last,
let's make it a wonderful last.

28:24.526 --> 28:28.246
Enjoy our lovely home and the lovely
people we spend our life among.

28:42.086 --> 28:44.164
Bit early for drowning your sorrows.

28:44.169 --> 28:47.086
I thought it might be better
if I moved down to the pub.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.268
You're not serious?

28:49.368 --> 28:51.768
I can't go through many more dinners
like last night.

28:51.769 --> 28:53.766
You don't make it easy for them.

28:54.126 --> 28:57.646
Do you really think you can recruit
cousin Robert for Sinn Fein?

28:57.766 --> 28:59.804
I don't know what gets into me.

28:59.809 --> 29:02.684
I can see them staring
and I know they don't want me here.

29:02.689 --> 29:04.524
Well, don't include me. Or Mary.

29:04.529 --> 29:08.124
She wasn't too keen on the idea of a
chauffeur for a brother-in-law.

29:08.129 --> 29:10.246
Forget that. She's a pragmatist.

29:10.486 --> 29:13.844
She could be a tough fighter, too.
- Let's hope she's not tested.

29:13.849 --> 29:18.124
Forget this and walk back. We are
brothers-in-law with high-minded wives.

29:18.129 --> 29:20.126
We'd better stick together.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.204
It's all there.

29:29.209 --> 29:31.924
Friends.
Though there weren't too many...

29:31.929 --> 29:34.004
tradesmen, acquaintances.

29:34.009 --> 29:36.524
But I can't see
what you'll get out of them.

29:36.529 --> 29:39.204
I do not believe,
when Vera decided to kill herself,

29:39.209 --> 29:41.764
she never mentioned it
to another living soul.

29:41.769 --> 29:43.524
We know she left no note.

29:43.529 --> 29:45.526
I wish to God she had.

29:46.166 --> 29:49.204
But why are you sure it was suicide
and not murder?

29:49.209 --> 29:51.364
Well, I know you didn't kill her.

29:51.369 --> 29:53.604
What's the alternative?

29:53.609 --> 29:57.366
A thief broke in, cooked an arsenic
pie and forced her to eat it?

29:57.766 --> 30:00.046
It's not a very likely scenario.

30:01.126 --> 30:03.126
You can see why they convicted me.

30:03.526 --> 30:05.884
I'm going to write to everyone
in the book,

30:05.889 --> 30:09.244
in case she said,
or, please god, wrote anything

30:09.249 --> 30:11.246
that could suggest a desire to die.

30:11.926 --> 30:14.364
How long will that take?

30:14.369 --> 30:17.726
Why? Are you going somewhere?

30:20.406 --> 30:24.284
I should have gone into cooking.
I could pick it up in a trice.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.206
Why didn't you, then?
- It's a hard ladder for a man.

30:27.686 --> 30:31.324
For every Escoffier and Monsieur
Careme there's a thousand dogsbodies

30:31.329 --> 30:34.044
taking orders from a cross,
red-faced old woman.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.804
Who's this you're discussing?

30:35.809 --> 30:38.804
Hello, Mrs Patmore.
I didn't see you standing there.

30:38.809 --> 30:40.806
Obviously not.

30:41.206 --> 30:45.284
Sarah thought I'd be better off as a butler
and that's what I'm trying for.

30:45.289 --> 30:48.044
I think you're right.
I'd rather be giving the orders.

30:48.049 --> 30:51.726
To a cross and red-faced old woman.
Yes, we know.

30:56.126 --> 30:58.604
There. Is that what you meant?

30:58.609 --> 31:00.606
Yes. Perfect.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.326
Slightly new, but not too different.

31:04.886 --> 31:07.086
We'll see if Sir Anthony notices.

31:10.206 --> 31:13.326
I know they all think he's too old
for me, but he's not.

31:13.526 --> 31:16.406
Bates is older than you
and you're as happy as lovebirds.

31:17.166 --> 31:19.166
Our situation is hardly ideal, but

31:20.486 --> 31:23.006
yes, we're very happy together.

31:23.846 --> 31:25.846
Which is all that matters.

31:26.366 --> 31:28.366
As I keep telling them.

31:33.286 --> 31:36.846
I've no time to talk.
- His lordship's not come up yet.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.286
Well? What is it?

31:40.086 --> 31:43.966
I was hoping you could help
young Alfred to find his way about.

31:45.206 --> 31:47.806
As a footman, you mean.
- As a valet.

31:49.086 --> 31:51.124
He's looking after Mr Branson now.

31:51.129 --> 31:54.004
Though I daresay a chauffeur
can dress himself.

31:54.009 --> 31:57.324
But you could tell him what he needs
to know, give him an advantage.

31:57.329 --> 31:59.164
Why? What's the rush?

31:59.169 --> 32:02.086
You've heard Mr Matthew
has turned down Mr Molesley?

32:02.606 --> 32:04.606
Blimey, you don't want much, do you?

32:05.926 --> 32:08.564
Can you remember what I had
to go through to be a valet?

32:08.569 --> 32:10.964
Of course. I watched it, didn't I?

32:10.969 --> 32:13.964
But young Alfred is to make
the great leap in one bound?

32:13.969 --> 32:17.086
Well, I'm sorry, Miss O'Brien,
but I'm not convinced.

32:18.126 --> 32:20.126
If you'll excuse me.

32:44.022 --> 32:46.340
It's infuriating.
There's nothing he can do.

32:46.345 --> 32:48.380
I don't agree. I think it's feeble.

32:48.385 --> 32:52.380
He should will himself not to be ill
and then collapse the next day.

32:52.385 --> 32:56.062
Whom will you ask instead?
- I'm not sure.

32:56.462 --> 32:58.300
I've known Sybil all my life.

32:58.305 --> 33:02.100
You can imagine how curious I was
when I found out you'd be here tonight.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.460
Never thought we'd meet in person.

33:04.465 --> 33:06.862
As opposed to what? In spirit?

33:08.902 --> 33:12.180
Well, you see, to us,
in marrying you

33:12.185 --> 33:15.222
it seemed like Sybil
had left Downton Abbey forever.

33:16.742 --> 33:18.742
If you know what I mean.

33:19.422 --> 33:21.422
I know exactly what you mean.

33:23.182 --> 33:27.500
Did they lose your suitcase on the
way over? How maddening for you.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.300
No, my suitcase arrived safely,
thank you.

33:30.305 --> 33:32.302
Along with my manners.

33:37.462 --> 33:40.662
He's still dressed as
the man from the Prudential, I see.

33:41.542 --> 33:44.862
Yes, it's nice to have someone
from the real world, isn't it?

33:48.222 --> 33:51.140
Hello, Mama. Can I tempt you
to one of these new cocktails?

33:51.145 --> 33:53.100
I don't think so.

33:53.105 --> 33:55.940
They look too exciting
for so early in the evening.

33:55.945 --> 33:58.060
Don't you think so, Carson?

33:58.065 --> 34:00.582
Better avoided, my lady.
- I think so.

34:02.022 --> 34:05.422
What a pleasure it is to see you
out and about, Sir Anthony.

34:05.942 --> 34:09.820
I want to say, 'Can I be of any help?'
but you don't seem to need any.

34:09.824 --> 34:13.340
He doesn't need help at all, do you?
He won't let me do anything.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.141
Mustn't be a nuisance, you know.

34:15.862 --> 34:18.342
Are you coming to the wedding?
- Of course.

34:19.782 --> 34:21.782
Well, if you really want me.

34:22.422 --> 34:24.742
I do. I really do.

34:26.422 --> 34:30.342
You look very nice. Have you done
something jolly with your hair?

34:31.661 --> 34:33.500
I say. What the devil...

34:33.505 --> 34:35.060
What is it?

34:35.065 --> 34:37.062
Dinner is served, your ladyship.

34:40.782 --> 34:42.580
How's it going?
- Awkward.

34:42.585 --> 34:46.219
Mr Branson's well away
and Lady Sybil doesn't like it much.

34:46.225 --> 34:48.340
He's only had one cocktail.

34:48.344 --> 34:51.742
Maybe he was drinking before
he came down to calm his nerves.

34:54.101 --> 34:56.980
No, I don't agree,
and I don't care who knows it.

34:56.985 --> 34:59.860
The Black and Tans are there
to restore order, are they?

34:59.865 --> 35:02.260
Why don't they just murder
the entire population

35:02.265 --> 35:04.460
and then you wouldn't hear a squeak
from them.

35:04.465 --> 35:08.380
Is there any way to shut him up?
- If I knew that, he wouldn't be here at all.

35:08.385 --> 35:10.900
Are you interested in Irish politics,
Lord Merton?

35:10.905 --> 35:13.980
I was only just saying...
- He's interested in Irish repression.

35:13.985 --> 35:17.780
Like all of you.
- Look, of course this stuff matters to you.

35:17.785 --> 35:19.620
Yes, it does matter...

35:19.625 --> 35:23.220
this stuff.
It matters a very great deal.

35:23.225 --> 35:25.460
What's so funny?
- Nothing.

35:25.465 --> 35:28.662
I'm just enjoying this vivid display
of Irish character.

35:29.702 --> 35:32.622
Please, Tom.
We don't need to wear everyone out.

35:32.862 --> 35:38.542
Why? What's the matter?
Am I not being polite enough?

35:39.182 --> 35:41.780
What a minute.
This was down to you, wasn't it?

35:41.785 --> 35:44.140
I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

35:44.145 --> 35:48.062
You put something in his drink,
didn't you? Just before we came in.

35:48.942 --> 35:52.060
That's not true, is it, Larry?
- What a beastly thing to do.

35:52.065 --> 35:55.580
Oh, come on, Edith. That's not like
you. You could always take a joke.

35:55.585 --> 35:57.580
A bully's defence.

35:57.585 --> 36:02.100
Listen, Mr Grey has given Mr Branson
something to make him appear drunk.

36:02.105 --> 36:05.340
Could it be drink?
- No, not drink. Some horrible pill.

36:05.345 --> 36:08.142
Sybil, take him upstairs.
- Il ne manque que ca.

36:08.782 --> 36:10.860
Tom has been the victim
of a cruel prank

36:10.865 --> 36:13.820
which I know you'll all
be kind enough to forget.

36:13.825 --> 36:18.420
Forgive, perhaps. Forget? Never.
- Is this true, Larry?

36:18.425 --> 36:21.540
I don't know why you're getting
so hot under the collar.

36:21.545 --> 36:23.500
He's only a grubby little chauffeur.

36:23.505 --> 36:25.462
Be silent this instant, sir.

36:28.182 --> 36:31.022
I apologise for my son, Mr Branson.
Unreservedly.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.702
I only hope
you'll recover before the wedding.

36:35.822 --> 36:37.740
I hope so too.

36:37.745 --> 36:40.142
Since I want him to be my best man.

36:43.782 --> 36:46.420
Bravo. Well said.

36:46.425 --> 36:48.540
Do you really mean it?
- Honestly?

36:48.545 --> 36:51.740
I've told you. If we're mad enough
to take on the Crawley girls,

36:51.745 --> 36:53.742
we have to stick together.

36:54.302 --> 36:56.422
Thank you, Matthew.
Thank you so much.

36:59.422 --> 37:03.140
That was rather marvellous of you
to expose Larry Grey like that.

37:03.145 --> 37:04.336
You saved the day.

37:04.436 --> 37:06.544
I wouldn't say that.
Matthew saved the day.

37:06.545 --> 37:08.542
No, it was you.

37:09.502 --> 37:13.220
I do hope we'll see a bit more of you
once the wedding's over.

37:13.225 --> 37:15.300
Well...
- Wouldn't you like that?

37:15.305 --> 37:17.302
I should like that very much.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.022
Much more than I probably ought to.

37:20.662 --> 37:22.782
Edith, let Sir Anthony go.

37:32.022 --> 37:34.022
Goodnight, Papa.

37:41.542 --> 37:43.500
Well, that's the last of them.

37:43.505 --> 37:45.820
Where are the others?
- They've gone to bed.

37:45.825 --> 37:47.822
So's Edith. And so should we.

37:49.342 --> 37:53.062
Golly. What a night
for the county to feed off.

37:53.622 --> 37:56.422
It was good of Matthew
to show solidarity.

37:56.902 --> 37:58.902
I suppose so.

37:59.342 --> 38:02.100
We're going to need
all the solidarity we can muster.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.102
When will you tell the girls?

38:06.782 --> 38:10.462
I think I should tell Mary now.
- Not before the wedding, surely.

38:10.902 --> 38:14.020
I must. They're disagreeing
about where they should live.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.340
It would be wrong for me
to keep it from them.

38:16.345 --> 38:19.622
They can discuss it on the honeymoon
and decide more sensibly.

38:21.142 --> 38:23.919
Should we say something to your
mother when she gets here?

38:24.019 --> 38:25.484
No.

38:25.785 --> 38:29.902
She'll go into state mourning
and cast a pall over the whole proceedings.

38:30.582 --> 38:34.060
Thank god she missed tonight's drama
or we'd never hear the end of it.

38:34.065 --> 38:37.662
Don't worry.
She'll bring enough drama of her own.

38:44.142 --> 38:46.180
It won't work, you know.

38:46.185 --> 38:49.700
If you don't admit your guilt,
they won't let you go.

38:49.705 --> 38:51.862
How can I admit what isn't true?

38:53.022 --> 38:56.062
Why do you have to be so pious?

38:58.422 --> 39:00.422
You're a touchy fella, aren't you?

39:02.182 --> 39:04.700
Don't push me, Craig.

39:04.705 --> 39:06.702
Is that a warning?

39:07.062 --> 39:09.702
Yes. Yes, it is.

39:12.782 --> 39:14.782
I'm warning you.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.220
I'm not sure about the hat.

39:24.225 --> 39:26.380
Is it supposed to look crooked?

39:26.385 --> 39:29.980
Don't listen to her. I love it.
You're not to change a thing.

39:29.985 --> 39:32.780
Anna?
- I think you look lovely, my lady.

39:34.585 --> 39:37.220
Stop. Wait. Who is it?

39:37.225 --> 39:40.502
Your long-suffering papa.
- I suppose he can come in.

39:43.182 --> 39:45.542
What's this for?
- Going away.

39:45.902 --> 39:48.462
How does it look?
- Expensive.

39:49.142 --> 39:51.140
Twice the national debt, I'm afraid.

39:51.145 --> 39:53.422
But I know you don't mind.

39:54.422 --> 39:57.380
Can I have one moment alone
to give Mary my blessing?

39:57.385 --> 40:00.982
That's lovely. Shoo, everyone.

40:06.982 --> 40:08.982
Go on, bless me.

40:09.702 --> 40:14.202
Of course. But there's something
I feel I ought to tell you first.

40:15.102 --> 40:18.862
I wanted to wait until you got back,
but I don't believe I can.

40:19.702 --> 40:21.902
That sounds rather ominous.

40:26.902 --> 40:29.740
Hello, Mr Molesley.
I got a message to call on Mrs Crawley.

40:29.745 --> 40:34.062
Very good, sir. If you'd like
to give me your hat and coat, sir.

40:34.542 --> 40:38.380
Are you going up to the house
to welcome the Queen of Sheba?

40:38.385 --> 40:40.380
Oh, I think so.

40:40.385 --> 40:42.420
Are you?
- No.

40:42.425 --> 40:44.380
I'll pay homage at dinner.

40:44.385 --> 40:47.420
I've always admired the way
Mrs Levinson is never overawed

40:47.425 --> 40:49.333
by the set-up at Downton. 

40:50.105 --> 40:52.951
Was Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons?

40:54.222 --> 40:56.222
Come in, Tom.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.342
May I call you Tom?
- Of course.

41:01.342 --> 41:04.142
Good afternoon, my lady.
That is, Lady Grantham.

41:04.502 --> 41:06.502
I'm glad to find you here because...

41:07.422 --> 41:09.502
I want to apologise for last night.

41:10.102 --> 41:12.980
Oh, there's no need.
We know it was not your fault.

41:12.985 --> 41:17.222
You weren't the first drunk in that
dining room, I can assure you.

41:17.862 --> 41:19.900
Only the first republican.

41:19.905 --> 41:21.662
Well, you've got me there.

41:22.742 --> 41:24.780
Why was it you wanted to see me?

41:24.785 --> 41:27.580
We asked Molesley to look out
Matthew's old morning coat.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.620
He's confident he can make it fit.

41:29.625 --> 41:31.460
That's very kind, ladies.

41:31.465 --> 41:34.060
But I don't approve of these costumes.

41:34.065 --> 41:36.180
I see them as the uniform of oppression

41:36.185 --> 41:38.420
and I should be uncomfortable
wearing them.

41:38.425 --> 41:40.422
Have you quite finished?

41:41.182 --> 41:43.182
I have.
- Good.

41:43.942 --> 41:46.142
Please take off your coat.

41:47.302 --> 41:49.140
Molesley, do help him.

41:49.145 --> 41:51.142
If you'll just slip it off, sir.

41:55.942 --> 41:58.540
Shouldn't he put the waistcoat on first?

41:58.545 --> 42:02.260
What's going on?
- They're forcing me into a morning coat.

42:02.265 --> 42:06.462
He has no say in it?
- No, he doesn't. And nor do you.

42:07.142 --> 42:09.620
Well, what do you think, Molesley?

42:09.625 --> 42:12.582
It'll need lifting a little here,
my lady.

42:12.942 --> 42:14.820
I'll move the buttons.
- Fine.

42:14.825 --> 42:17.460
I think the shoulders look odd.

42:43.262 --> 42:46.100
Come war and peace,
Downton still stands

42:46.105 --> 42:48.102
and the Crawleys are still in it.

42:49.582 --> 42:51.660
Cora.
- Mother, how lovely to see you.

42:51.665 --> 42:53.660
As long as it is.

42:53.665 --> 42:56.942
Robert, aren't you going to kiss me?
- With the greatest enthusiasm.

42:58.262 --> 43:00.182
Tell me, where does this come from?

43:00.742 --> 43:02.740
I hired it in Liverpool. Why?

43:02.745 --> 43:04.795
I thought it might be a gift
from the US government

43:04.895 --> 43:07.092
to help get Britain back on its feet.

43:08.422 --> 43:12.780
Carson and Mrs Hughes.
The world has moved on since last we met.

43:12.785 --> 43:15.300
And we have moved on with it, madam.

43:15.305 --> 43:17.140
Really?

43:17.145 --> 43:20.540
It seems so strange to think
of the English embracing change.

43:20.545 --> 43:22.622
Mrs Hughes, this is my maid...
Reed.

43:23.022 --> 43:26.260
Sybil, tell me all about the
arrangements for the birth.

43:26.265 --> 43:29.382
We do these things so much better
in the States.

43:29.862 --> 43:32.302
Edith, still no-one special?

43:32.942 --> 43:37.420
Oh, well, never mind. You must take
a tip from the modern American girl.

43:37.425 --> 43:40.060
Mary, dearest Mary.

43:40.065 --> 43:43.300
Now, you tell me all of your wedding plans

43:43.305 --> 43:45.582
and I'll see what I can do to improve them.

43:56.262 --> 44:00.620
What's the matter with you?
- Mrs Patmore knows.

44:00.625 --> 44:03.860
Shall I tell you Mrs Levinson's
requirements during her stay?

44:03.865 --> 44:07.622
No, tell her.
- Yes, Miss Reed. How can I help?

44:07.942 --> 44:10.860
To start with I will need goats' milk
in the mornings.

44:10.865 --> 44:12.862
Goats' milk? Fancy that.

44:13.062 --> 44:14.860
She drinks only boiled water.

44:14.865 --> 44:17.220
Really?
- In England, that is.

44:17.225 --> 44:19.860
Shouldn't Daisy do this?
- I ought to take the tea up.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.862
I'll have it ready in a moment.

44:24.622 --> 44:27.982
No fats, no crab
and nothing from the marrow family.

44:28.862 --> 44:31.540
Do explain again how exactly

44:31.545 --> 44:34.062
you are related to all of us, Mr Crawley.

44:35.102 --> 44:37.260
Rather distantly, I'm afraid.

44:37.265 --> 44:41.207
My great-great-grandfather
was a younger son of a third earl.

44:42.065 --> 44:46.460
My. I'm going to have to write
that down, so I can study it.

44:46.465 --> 44:49.660
Look at our page in Burke's.
You'll find Matthew there.

44:49.665 --> 44:51.900
Good. Because I would
so like to understand

44:51.905 --> 44:55.102
why he gets to inherit
my late husband's money.

44:55.782 --> 44:57.982
I know. It's funny, isn't it?

44:58.742 --> 45:00.900
Not everyone shares
your sense of humour.

45:00.905 --> 45:03.820
Surely it doesn't matter
now that they're getting married.

45:03.825 --> 45:07.140
In fact, we'd better turn him out
or it'll be bad luck for tomorrow.

45:07.145 --> 45:09.142
Quite right.

45:15.702 --> 45:18.420
You must be the chauffeur
I've heard so much about.

45:18.425 --> 45:21.900
I am, ma'am.
- Tom's a journalist now, Grandmama.

45:21.905 --> 45:25.742
Oh, well, well. I've heard of those
journeys on my side of the water.

45:26.342 --> 45:29.422
It's very pleasant to hear of them
happening here.

45:32.582 --> 45:35.622
It's all right, Mama.
You can leave us unchaperoned.

45:35.982 --> 45:38.260
After tomorrow,
 all things are permitted.

45:38.265 --> 45:40.340
Don't embarrass me.

45:40.345 --> 45:42.340
Bye, Matthew.

45:42.345 --> 45:44.702
Get a good night's sleep.

45:49.342 --> 45:52.502
How many moments of Crawley history
has this room seen?

45:53.142 --> 45:55.182
And many more to come.

45:55.902 --> 45:57.902
I hope so.

45:58.862 --> 46:02.702
In fact, what happened in the search
for Mr Pumpkin?

46:03.302 --> 46:05.700
Swire's heir.
Have you heard anything?

46:05.705 --> 46:08.902
Yes, Charkham sent a telegram.
I've got it here, actually.

46:16.262 --> 46:19.382
Convincing proof of Pullbrook's death.
Stop.

46:19.982 --> 46:22.022
Investigating date.

46:22.782 --> 46:24.500
What does that mean?

46:24.505 --> 46:28.700
Well, if Pullbrook died after Reggie
then his heirs get the money.

46:28.705 --> 46:30.780
If he died first, then I do.

46:30.785 --> 46:34.140
But that's absurd. What right have
his heirs to inherit anything?

46:34.145 --> 46:37.500
Darling, what right have I?
Frankly, what difference does it make?

46:37.505 --> 46:39.340
I shan't keep it if I get it.

46:39.345 --> 46:41.742
Well, actually, you will.

46:42.422 --> 46:45.062
Because something rather terrible
has happened.

46:46.422 --> 46:51.382
You see, apparently Papa
has lost a great deal of money.

46:52.782 --> 46:56.660
Enough to ruin him.
Enough for us to lose Downton.

46:56.665 --> 46:58.702
God, I'm sorry.

46:59.782 --> 47:01.697
I'm so sorry.
- Yes, but

47:01.997 --> 47:06.683
surely if Mr Pullbrook did die
before Swire, then we're saved.

47:08.422 --> 47:10.662
Darling, I don't think you understand.

47:12.422 --> 47:14.940
Reggie Swire put me in his will
because he believed

47:14.945 --> 47:16.982
I was his daughter's one true love.

47:17.782 --> 47:19.782
So you were.
- Yes, but...

47:21.422 --> 47:24.782
But I broke Lavinia's heart and she died.
He never knew that.

47:25.542 --> 47:29.102
How could I possibly allow myself
to profit from her death to...

47:29.902 --> 47:34.140
to dine in splendour because I took away
a woman's will to live?

47:34.145 --> 47:37.860
So, you're prepared to destroy us
in payment for your destroying her?

47:37.865 --> 47:41.620
Darling, please. You know
I would do anything for this family.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.500
Anything except help us.

47:43.505 --> 47:47.620
Except save Papa from living out
his days in humiliation and grief.

47:47.625 --> 47:50.620
And what about us?
What about our children?

47:50.625 --> 47:53.020
God, Matthew,
how can you be so disappointing?

47:53.025 --> 47:55.860
Mary, please.
- No. Don't you see what this means?

47:55.865 --> 47:58.260
Don't you see what a difference this makes?

47:58.265 --> 48:00.980
It means that you're not on our side,
Matthew.

48:00.985 --> 48:03.622
It means that deep down
you're not on our side.

48:24.368 --> 48:26.966
How are you getting on
with your new companion?

48:26.971 --> 48:30.048
I don't like him,
but so far I've kept it to myself.

48:31.528 --> 48:34.248
So, who are the bridesmaids?

48:35.248 --> 48:37.846
You don't care about all that?
- You're wrong.

48:37.851 --> 48:39.928
It's the stuff of my dreams.

48:40.248 --> 48:43.326
The panic that a dinner won't
be ready, or a frock isn't ironed,

48:43.331 --> 48:45.328
or a gun wasn't cleaned.

48:45.408 --> 48:47.059
Do you know where you're going
for the honeymoon?

48:47.151 --> 48:49.128
I want to talk about that.

48:49.228 --> 48:52.080
They'll stay in London with
Lady Rosamund for a couple of days,

48:52.180 --> 48:54.220
just to get used to each other...

48:55.728 --> 48:57.848
and then they go to the South of France.

48:58.448 --> 49:02.488
I'll hire replacements in London
and then I'll come home instead.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.246
Lady Mary won't mind. I'll pay.

49:05.251 --> 49:07.326
Why would you do that?

49:07.331 --> 49:09.486
Well, to be near you, of course.

49:09.491 --> 49:11.526
Don't you understand?

49:11.531 --> 49:14.766
While I'm in here you have
to live my life as well as your own.

49:14.771 --> 49:19.267
Go to France, see some sites,
get us some memories.

49:20.008 --> 49:21.806
But I wouldn't be home for a month.

49:21.811 --> 49:23.966
Won't we have something
to talk about?

49:23.971 --> 49:25.968
Go. I insist.

49:27.368 --> 49:29.368
For my sake.

49:30.728 --> 49:32.728
I was so afraid I was going to be late.

49:35.768 --> 49:37.768
Violet.

49:41.048 --> 49:42.886
Oh, dear.

49:42.891 --> 49:46.166
I'm afraid the war has made
old women of us both.

49:46.171 --> 49:50.648
Oh, I wouldn't say that. But then,
I always keep out of the sun.

49:51.528 --> 49:53.726
How do you find Downton
on your return?

49:53.731 --> 49:55.566
Much the same, really.

49:55.571 --> 49:58.566
Probably too much the same,
but I don't want to cast a pall

49:58.571 --> 50:02.088
over all the happiness.
- How could you ever do that?

50:03.248 --> 50:05.926
Tell me, what do you think
of young Lochinvar

50:05.931 --> 50:09.606
who has so ably carried off
our granddaughter and our money?

50:09.611 --> 50:12.326
Do you approve of him?
- Not as much as you will...

50:12.331 --> 50:14.526
when you get to know him.

50:14.531 --> 50:18.488
Has he gone home to change?
- Oh, no, we won't see him again tonight.

50:19.408 --> 50:23.168
The groom never sees the bride
the night before the wedding.

50:24.728 --> 50:27.246
Nothing ever alters for you people,
does it?

50:27.251 --> 50:30.166
Revolutions erupt
and monarchies crash to the ground

50:30.171 --> 50:33.088
and the groom still cannot see
the bride before the wedding.

50:33.528 --> 50:38.028
You Americans never understand
the importance of tradition.

50:38.928 --> 50:41.808
Yes, we do.
We just don't give it power over us.

50:42.368 --> 50:45.528
History and tradition took Europe
into a world war.

50:46.088 --> 50:48.848
Maybe you should think about
letting go of its hand.

50:54.208 --> 50:56.166
There you are.

50:56.171 --> 50:58.486
I see you've said hello to Grandmama.

50:58.491 --> 51:00.608
She is like a homing pigeon.

51:02.288 --> 51:05.328
She finds our underbelly every time.

51:06.688 --> 51:08.688
Dreadful woman.

51:08.808 --> 51:11.966
No, it wasn't me.
Someone sent Sybil and Tom

51:11.971 --> 51:13.846
the price for the tickets to come over.

51:13.851 --> 51:17.606
Does it matter who it was?
It meant we could be at the wedding.

51:17.611 --> 51:21.246
Of course I wish it had been you, Papa.
But I don't mind.

51:21.251 --> 51:23.166
I thank them, whoever they are.

51:23.171 --> 51:27.326
Well, I'm very glad you're here, but
it wasn't me either, I'm sad to say.

51:27.331 --> 51:30.086
I love a mystery. Who could it be?

51:30.091 --> 51:33.406
My guess is cousin Isobel.
She always likes to stick her oar in.

51:33.411 --> 51:35.206
I'm going to ask her.

51:35.211 --> 51:37.208
For heaven's sake. It was me.

51:41.048 --> 51:43.526
You? But it wasn't your writing.

51:43.531 --> 51:45.566
No. Smithers did it.

51:45.571 --> 51:48.166
Like all ladies' maids
she lives for intrigue.

51:48.171 --> 51:50.046
You wanted me to come here?

51:50.051 --> 51:54.488
I wanted Sybil and her husband
to be here for Mary's wedding, yes.

51:55.408 --> 51:57.408
Why keep that secret?

51:58.048 --> 51:59.886
Silly, wasn't it?

51:59.891 --> 52:02.286
I'm very touched. I'll admit it.

52:02.291 --> 52:04.566
How democratic.

52:04.571 --> 52:07.168
Makes me think
maybe I have been mistaken in you.

52:07.608 --> 52:09.568
I am a woman of many parts.

52:10.608 --> 52:13.968
After all, Branson is...
I mean, Tom...

52:14.488 --> 52:16.526
You're a member of the family now.

52:16.531 --> 52:19.088
You'll find we Crawleys stick together.

52:19.768 --> 52:23.206
Not always.
- Mary, what is it?

52:23.211 --> 52:25.208
Nothing, it's just...

52:27.608 --> 52:29.608
Oh, Mary.

52:33.928 --> 52:36.928
Oh, there you are.
That's all for this course.

52:37.408 --> 52:39.408
Don't you think, Daisy?

52:39.928 --> 52:42.486
Is Daisy all right, Mrs Patmore?
- Oh, yes.

52:42.491 --> 52:44.526
She's been such a big help.

52:44.531 --> 52:47.886
Now, I think we should
check the pudding, Daisy.

52:47.891 --> 52:49.926
Don't you agree?

52:49.931 --> 52:53.766
It's nerves. Everyone cries
at some point before their wedding.

52:53.771 --> 52:55.846
But what was the quarrel about?

52:55.851 --> 52:59.846
I'm not sure. I know she accused him
of not being on our side.

52:59.851 --> 53:03.446
Oh, well, I hope she's wrong.
That could be rather serious.

53:03.451 --> 53:06.886
Of course he's on our side.
It's ridiculous. I'll go and see him.

53:06.891 --> 53:10.928
No, I'll go. I'm his best man.
I should be the one to go.

53:11.208 --> 53:14.726
What?
- I know what it is to marry into this family.

53:14.731 --> 53:16.846
I'm not comparing myself to Mr Crawley,

53:16.851 --> 53:19.406
but he is another kind of outsider.
- Well, I hardly...

53:19.411 --> 53:21.806
Well, why not?
He's the one who'll lose his job

53:21.811 --> 53:23.808
if the wedding's cancelled.

53:27.928 --> 53:31.208
I see what you're doing, you know?
- What's that, then?

53:31.728 --> 53:33.966
Not responding to my protest.

53:33.971 --> 53:36.446
Not responding to my protest.

53:36.451 --> 53:38.486
Very elegant, I must say.

53:38.491 --> 53:40.326
Who've you been talking to?

53:40.331 --> 53:42.448
Thomas?
- Well...

53:44.528 --> 53:46.648
Oh, just give me the cloth and I'll dry.

53:53.088 --> 53:56.566
Suppose he never gets the money...
- It's not about the money.

53:56.571 --> 53:59.128
It's that he won't save Papa
when he could.

54:00.928 --> 54:02.966
But he has to be true to himself.

54:02.971 --> 54:06.806
That's the point.
He puts himself above the rest of us.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.808
Don't you see?

54:09.248 --> 54:12.048
What I see is a good man, my lady.

54:13.088 --> 54:15.086
And they're not like buses.

54:15.091 --> 54:18.088
There won't be another one along
in ten minutes' time.

54:28.968 --> 54:30.968
It seems big, but it's not big.

54:32.688 --> 54:34.646
And if it happens?

54:34.651 --> 54:36.766
I get the money.

54:36.771 --> 54:38.768
I can't do what she wants.

54:39.328 --> 54:43.608
It's strange for me to be arguing
about inherited money and saving estates.

54:43.728 --> 54:47.008
When the old me would like to put
a bomb under the lot of you.

54:47.488 --> 54:50.928
But?
- But you're meant to be together.

54:51.888 --> 54:54.566
I've known that as long
as I've been at the house.

54:54.571 --> 54:57.968
And at first this kept you apart
and then that kept you apart.

54:59.488 --> 55:01.568
But please don't risk it a third time.

55:02.368 --> 55:04.368
Because I'll tell you this.

55:04.768 --> 55:08.288
You won't be happy with anyone else
while Lady Mary walks the earth.

55:08.888 --> 55:11.608
Call her Mary, please.
- Never mind what I call her.

55:12.408 --> 55:16.448
I know what I'll call you if you let
this chance slip through your fingers.

55:30.208 --> 55:33.846
I just need a word.
- No. Go away.

55:33.851 --> 55:36.006
I'm undressed. You can't come in.

55:36.011 --> 55:38.526
One word. Come to the door.

55:38.531 --> 55:41.408
Please. Just give him this chance.

55:42.088 --> 55:44.808
I won't look at you.
- It'd be unlucky if you did.

55:45.528 --> 55:47.528
Only if we were getting married.

55:48.168 --> 55:50.168
Which we are.

56:00.448 --> 56:03.846
My darling, I refuse to quarrel
about something that hasn't happened

56:03.851 --> 56:05.606
and probably never will.

56:05.611 --> 56:07.608
That's what Anna says.

56:08.088 --> 56:10.088
Then she's right.

56:11.208 --> 56:15.579
My darling, I'm sure we will fight
about money and about Downton,

56:16.928 --> 56:19.846
about how to rear our children,
about any number of things.

56:19.851 --> 56:22.386
Then shouldn't we accept it?

56:22.691 --> 56:25.048
Matthew, I've been thinking...

56:25.648 --> 56:27.968
And I'm not angry now, truly I'm not.

56:28.848 --> 56:32.286
But if we can disagree over
something as fundamental as this,

56:32.291 --> 56:35.688
then shouldn't we be brave
and back away now?

56:36.368 --> 56:38.166
No.

56:38.171 --> 56:41.766
It's not because you're afraid of
calling it off? Because I'm not.

56:41.771 --> 56:43.768
No.

56:44.288 --> 56:46.288
It's because of something Tom said.

56:49.168 --> 56:53.288
That I would never be happy with anyone else
as long as you walked the earth.

56:53.568 --> 56:55.568
Which is true.

56:56.808 --> 57:00.808
And I think you feel the same about me.

57:08.728 --> 57:10.728
Can I kiss you?

57:11.968 --> 57:13.968
Because I need to.

57:14.808 --> 57:18.328
Very much.
- No. It's bad luck to look at me.

57:19.288 --> 57:21.608
What about if I close my eyes
and you do too?

57:26.008 --> 57:28.046
All right.

57:28.051 --> 57:30.048
But you mustn't cheat.

57:57.848 --> 57:59.848
Good night.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.318
Right, I'm off to collect Matthew.

58:19.323 --> 58:20.738
You look very smart.

58:20.838 --> 58:23.721
I hope so.
Because I'm extremely uncomfortable.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.880
Branson...

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
That is, Tom.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.118
I want to thank you for what you did
last night. I'm grateful. I mean it.

58:35.123 --> 58:36.918
They're both strong characters.

58:36.923 --> 58:40.840
I'd say we have plenty of slamming
doors and shouting matches to come.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.278
Forgive me,
I was about to be indignant,

58:44.283 --> 58:46.800
but you have a perfect right
to speak as you do.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.998
I hope you mean that too.

58:49.003 --> 58:50.958
I do.

58:50.963 --> 58:52.960
Now, hurry up.

58:54.360 --> 58:58.080
You'd ask if there was anything
you wanted me to tell you.

58:58.440 --> 59:01.758
I mean, I'm sure you know.
- More than you did.

59:01.763 --> 59:04.918
And relax. There isn't anything
I need to hear now.

59:04.923 --> 59:08.960
Because when two people love each
other, you understand, everything...

59:11.520 --> 59:13.520
It's the most terrific fun.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.120
Careful, Mama, or you'll shock Anna.

59:16.800 --> 59:21.118
I'm a married woman now, my lady.
- I think we should go.

59:21.323 --> 59:24.198
What about Anna? How are you going
to get to the church?

59:24.203 --> 59:28.200
They're waiting for me in the wagonette.
I'll see you there.

59:29.520 --> 59:32.320
I know mine was a wild
runaway marriage, darling.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.438
And yours is the one everyone wanted.

59:35.443 --> 59:39.867
What's so thrilling
is that this is every bit as romantic.

59:40.640 --> 59:43.280
Thank you, for always being so sweet.

59:49.440 --> 59:53.923
Love and position in one handsome package.
Who could ask for more?

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
Never mind Edith.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.020
Well, very, very good luck,
my beautiful daughter.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.543
Now, you've a great big porter cab
all to yourselves. Think of that.

01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:29.798
So we'll expect you to behave
as if you were quite grown up.

01:00:29.803 --> 01:00:31.800
You can do that, can't you?

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.318
Got everything you need?
- Yes.

01:00:34.323 --> 01:00:36.320
Hop in, then.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.600
Careful with your dress.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.838
Settle down.

01:00:42.843 --> 01:00:44.840
All right?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.760
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- Bye.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.720
Bye-bye.
- Good luck.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.478
Have you got everything you need?
- We do.

01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:09.400
Now, be off with you and enjoy yourself.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.278
I wish we were going.

01:01:12.283 --> 01:01:15.000
Who'll get the food ready
for when they come back?

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.600
Still, fetch your coat
and we'll see her off.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.200
Right, see you in a minute.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.958
We're just leaving now, my lord.
As soon as we've got Anna.

01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:32.960
Here comes the bride.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.640
Will I do, Carson?

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.680
Very nicely, my lady.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.918
Thank heavens you got everything settled.
You had me worried.

01:02:15.923 --> 01:02:19.480
It's not quite settled, I'm afraid.
He won't get off that easily.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.478
But you're happy?

01:02:22.483 --> 01:02:24.480
I am.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.960
And what about you?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.787
I'm so happy, so very happy,
I feel my chest will explode.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.678
It's so lovely that you're here.
Come behind us.

01:02:55.683 --> 01:02:58.840
I can't. I'm not family.
- But you almost are.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.280
Morning.
- Thank you.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.478
Molesley, I'm very grateful to you

01:03:10.483 --> 01:03:12.520
for keeping Mr Branson up to the mark.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.800
We both are, aren't we?
- We certainly are.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560
Thank you, sir.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.080
This is a proud day, Mrs Hughes.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.640
I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm
very glad you're happy, Mr Carson.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.958
You're next, darling, you'll see.
- Will I?

01:03:35.963 --> 01:03:39.160
So encouraging to see the future unfurl.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.240
Good luck.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.880
You came.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.360
To be honest,
I wasn't completely sure you would.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.360
I'm glad to hear it.
I should hate to be predictable.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.918
I'm sorry, it still seems odd
to be found in your bed.

01:05:29.923 --> 01:05:33.078
Isn't it dangerous to let
this Strallan nonsense simmer on?

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:34.838
Ask him to end it.

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:37.558
Somehow the poor chap
managed to burn a hole in my tails.

01:05:37.563 --> 01:05:40.358
This is what comes of making him run
before he could walk.

01:05:40.363 --> 01:05:42.478
We've 20 lords and ladies
in the drawing room

01:05:42.483 --> 01:05:44.480
and we've got no dinner to give them.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.435
His lordship's in trouble.
He thinks he may have to sell.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.252
Sell Downton?
