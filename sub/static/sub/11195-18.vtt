00:05.923 --> 00:07.966
(Stargate alarm)

00:10.802 --> 00:13.347
- Chevron one encoded.
- Barber.

00:14.056 --> 00:17.017
When you get there,
give this to Daniel, will ya?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.895
- Sir?
- We had a bet.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.731
I lost.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.068
What'd you bet on?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.072
Sports related.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.033
Just give it to him. He'll know.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.160
Yes, sir.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.747
- What sport?
- Hm?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.416
- What sport did you bet on?
- Curling.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.378
- Daniel bet on curling.
- Oh, yes.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.464
His team won the big bonspiel.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.800
OK. You don't wanna tell me, that's fine.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.052
Good. Have fun.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.974
Chevron four encoded.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.276
Chevron five encoded.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.238
So, sir, are you sure you'd rather take
a weekend off than see this place?

01:11.363 --> 01:14.449
Oh, you know, I get that way
when I work my ass off.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.036
I figured you might want
some time off yourself.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.664
Oh, I do, but Daniel says if all the...

01:24.001 --> 01:30.174
That was the bet? Whether or not I'd go?
Don't you have anything better to do?

01:30.299 --> 01:32.342
Chevron seven locked.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.387
Barber!

01:40.350 --> 01:42.394
Oh, my God.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.970
- Jack! You have got to see this place.
- Daniel, there's been an incident.

02:58.053 --> 03:01.890
I know. But this is really important.
There is this most amazing light...

03:01.974 --> 03:04.184
Barber's dead.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.813
What?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.940
Come on.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.033
Did Lieutenant Barber show signs
of depression on the mission?

03:20.158 --> 03:23.579
The opposite. He was... fine.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.834
- How long had he been back?
- He hadn't been Earthside for 48 hours.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.838
- What was he doing?
- Awaiting a translation I was helping with.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.717
If you're asking if he was suicidal,
he wasn't. He was fine. He was...

03:37.259 --> 03:41.889
He was better than fine. Didn't anybody
talk to him or, like, notice anything?

03:42.014 --> 03:44.224
- Nothing.
- We were all taken by surprise.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.352
So am l. I don't even know what to say.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.650
We'll investigate what may have
compelled him to do what he did,...

03:53.734 --> 03:57.237
..but in my experience
these questions often go unanswered.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.363
Yes, sir.

03:58.488 --> 04:03.619
Dr Jackson, could you tell us more about
this Goa'uld palace you were studying?

04:05.996 --> 04:08.040
Dr Jackson?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.960
Yes, uh... Sorry... um...

04:12.252 --> 04:14.880
Were there any signs
of recent Goa'uld activity?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.173
No. No one had been there for centuries,...

04:17.298 --> 04:21.928
..but, uh... there was this room
where there was this pedestal.

04:22.012 --> 04:27.851
It projected this light matrix hologram
on the ceiling. It was absolutely stunning.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.979
- Any idea as to its purpose?
- Ideas, yes, but, uh...

04:31.188 --> 04:35.567
I was hoping... this... might tell me more.

04:36.443 --> 04:40.030
It's kinda like a Goa'uld
hand-held computer.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.116
It displays a Goa'uld dialect
I've never seen before.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.577
There were similar writings in the palace.

04:45.661 --> 04:50.791
I'm thinking, or hoping - crossing my
fingers, actually - that they're instructions.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.086
I would be happy to assist with
the translation, Daniel Jackson.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.755
Thank you. I was counting on that.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
Hey.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.699
- What you watchin'?
- A digital recording.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.911
I am endeavouring to translate the
writings of which Daniel Jackson spoke.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.205
How goes the endeavouring?

05:30.330 --> 05:34.001
Upon a second viewing, I have
discovered a figure in the background.

05:34.126 --> 05:37.004
It does not appear to be
one of our personnel.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.265
He never mentioned anyone else.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.771
What is wrong with this thing?

05:58.650 --> 06:02.863
- This thing isn't working.
- Did you check the battery?

06:06.116 --> 06:09.953
- I need to go back to the planet.
- Hammond suggested we go tomorrow.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.831
This isn't working and
tomorrow isn't good enough.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.375
Yes, it is.

06:16.752 --> 06:20.005
- I'm gonna talk to Hammond.
- Hey!

06:25.886 --> 06:29.723
- (Hammond) Have you slept at all?
- I fail to see what that has to do with it.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.975
SG-1 has been hard at it for weeks.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.521
I'm not sending you anywhere
until you've had a night's sleep.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.148
- I'm fine.
- You're exhausted, Doctor.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.692
I admit I have been pushing myself a bit.

06:40.776 --> 06:45.405
But this device could hold the key
to everything about that entire place.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.909
- I can't make any progress on it here.
- You're leaving tomorrow.

06:48.992 --> 06:53.163
- One day isn't going to make a difference.
- I'm telling you it is!

06:53.539 --> 06:55.332
Thank you for your time, sir...

06:55.415 --> 06:59.086
It is beyond my comprehension
how anybody who has so much power...

06:59.169 --> 07:01.547
- ..can miss the point entirely!
- Knock it off!

07:01.672 --> 07:03.882
It's all right, Colonel.

07:03.966 --> 07:08.929
This letter is to Lieutenant Barber's family
saying he died in the service of country.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.348
I've spent the last two hours on it.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.101
I can't tell them anything
about how he died,...

07:14.184 --> 07:18.438
..or anything about the work he did here.
Only that he's gone.

07:18.522 --> 07:22.651
- Do you get the point?
- Yes, sir. He does.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.196
Get him out of here.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.551
What's the delay?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.345
- Daniel hasn't reported in yet, sir.
- What?

07:50.429 --> 07:53.849
I just called him. I think he picked up,
but now I get a busy signal.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.310
Yesterday he wanted
to leave immediately.

07:56.435 --> 08:01.231
- Maybe I should give him a wake-up call.
- Sounds to me like he could use one.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.044
Daniel?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.027
Daniel.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.613
What are you doin' out here?

09:37.411 --> 09:40.497
None of it means anything.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.793
Um...

09:46.753 --> 09:49.423
Daniel, why don't you come inside here?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.634
I tried.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.223
It just... goes away.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.395
OK. Well, we'll, uh...

10:04.354 --> 10:06.648
We'll get it back.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.193
You can't get it back.

10:10.903 --> 10:14.156
Whatever's wrong, we'll... we'll fix it.

10:17.201 --> 10:20.787
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.915
No... No, I don't.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.214
But... come inside.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.682
Jack?

10:43.352 --> 10:45.395
Yeah.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.753
The PET scan shows that his
neurological activity is slowing.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.297
Neurotransmitters relay
messages in the body.

11:12.422 --> 11:19.221
Too many or too few can result in anxiety,
depression, or a number of disorders.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.974
Does this have anything to do
with Barber's thing?

11:22.057 --> 11:27.604
With the other members of SG-5 reporting
identical symptoms, it's almost certain.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.941
The good news is that it doesn't
appear to be due to a contagion.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.777
Well, if it's not a disease, what?

11:33.861 --> 11:37.781
I don't know. Such a drastic shift in levels
is generally drug induced,...

11:37.906 --> 11:40.701
..but their systems are
void of foreign substances.

11:40.784 --> 11:44.204
Not to mention that preliminary
MALP readings of P4X-347...

11:44.288 --> 11:47.291
..have ruled out the usual suspects:
air, radiation...

11:47.416 --> 11:51.170
So if we retrace SG-5's tracks,
we may come up with something.

11:51.295 --> 11:56.425
- I'm afraid, Colonel, until we get a grasp...
- General, we saw the shadow on video.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.553
Something or someone
is affecting these guys.

11:59.678 --> 12:00.929
More than that, sir.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.975
If their brain function continues to fail,
they face a worst-case scenario.

12:05.058 --> 12:09.855
So we go in MOPP 2. We bring back
samples of... the usual suspects.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.609
You've made your case, Colonel.
Watch your step.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.611
Thank you, sir.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.796
(O'Neill) I see why Daniel
was so hot on this place.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.590
Indeed.

12:38.383 --> 12:42.304
- What you got?
- The air's fine, as the MALP indicated.

12:42.387 --> 12:46.642
Whatever affected Daniel and SG-5,
they didn't breathe it in.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.401
OK. Watch your step.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.952
It's just a kid.
Obviously scared to death of us.

14:16.231 --> 14:20.277
I believe this is the room of light
of which Daniel Jackson has spoken.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.404
Really?

14:27.201 --> 14:29.912
Carter, what are we lookin' at here?

14:31.163 --> 14:33.207
Uh...

14:34.291 --> 14:39.254
It's not giving off any detectable radiation
other than visible light.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.257
I think it's just... decorative.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.970
Safe?

14:47.095 --> 14:51.391
It is most difficult to believe
that something so beautiful...

14:51.475 --> 14:54.019
..could be dangerous, O'Neill.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.606
No.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.510
We'll come back to it. Let's go.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.476
Hey! Let's go.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.854
Right. Sorry, sir.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.626
Sir, I'd like to perform
a full spectrum analysis on that light.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.711
Later.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.882
There might be a link between the light
and what's happening to Daniel.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.759
I thought you said it wasn't dangerous.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.393
I'm sure it isn't, sir. It's just that l...

17:08.737 --> 17:10.781
Hi.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.284
I'm Jack.

17:15.828 --> 17:18.121
And you are...?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.421
Nice digs.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.466
Kinda remind me of my first apartment.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.011
How are the people upstairs?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.471
Loran.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.932
I'm sorry.
I don't know what "Ioran" means.

17:37.015 --> 17:40.185
- It's me.
- Hi, Loran.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.188
- Jack.
- Yeah.

17:45.983 --> 17:50.028
- Anyone else live here with you?
- Mother and Father.

17:50.112 --> 17:53.031
Can you take me to 'em?
I'd like to talk to 'em.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.368
No.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.248
- They're not here.
- Not in this place?

18:02.875 --> 18:05.169
So you're here alone?

18:06.795 --> 18:09.006
Yes.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.341
Well, Loran...

18:11.466 --> 18:14.011
Some of my people
came here a few days ago.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.138
- I was hiding.
- You hide very well...

18:16.263 --> 18:18.932
..because they didn't
even know you were here.

18:19.016 --> 18:22.936
The thing is, when they came home,
they all got very sick.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.689
We'd like to figure out why.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.816
Do you know?

18:33.530 --> 18:37.284
OK. Well, we're going to have to
look around a little more.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.414
You should come along.

18:42.498 --> 18:45.751
(Carter) Colonel!
General Hammond is on the radio.

18:45.876 --> 18:48.170
All right. Go ahead. I'll be there.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.799
Come on.

19:15.614 --> 19:18.075
This is Hammond. Come in, Colonel.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.077
Where is he?

19:20.160 --> 19:24.414
He'sjust sending his voice over the radio,
this thing here.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.792
We read you, General.

19:30.087 --> 19:34.383
- I see you've made a friend, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.760
Loran. General Hammond.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.429
- He can see me?
- Yes, I can, son.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.224
Hi.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.519
We haven't found anything yet.
We've only had a few minutes.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.397
It's been well over an hour, Colonel.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.067
That can't be.

19:52.150 --> 19:56.780
Jack, I have some bad news.
All of SG-5 are dead.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.286
Oh, no.

20:02.369 --> 20:07.166
- What of the condition of Daniel Jackson?
- Dr Fraiser's doing everything she can,...

20:07.291 --> 20:10.460
..but I'm afraid he's
fallen into a deep coma.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.797
We don't know
how much time he has left.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.902
- Here are your samples.
- Get the boy's?

20:35.027 --> 20:36.904
It's in there.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.031
Get this off to the lab.

20:41.867 --> 20:46.163
- How's he doin'?
- I'm afraid his condition is unchanged.

20:49.875 --> 20:50.959
OK.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.420
So how long ago
was this image recorded?

21:35.504 --> 21:38.340
That's my home. Before we came here.

21:39.758 --> 21:44.471
- Your parents came from another world.
- Yeah. They were explorers.

21:44.596 --> 21:48.267
Kinda like you, I guess.
Till they came here, and then...

21:49.226 --> 21:51.103
What were we looking for?

21:51.186 --> 21:54.189
If you cannot explain
our friend's illness,...

21:54.273 --> 21:56.567
..we must search for clues as to its cause.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.403
Well, none of your friends were in here.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.031
Hey, uh... I want to show you something.

22:05.367 --> 22:09.037
This was a present from my father
on my birthday.

22:11.582 --> 22:14.042
No, it's not real.

22:27.222 --> 22:31.059
Children of the Tauri also enjoy
colourful weapons with no function.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.187
It's fun.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.027
I see.

22:40.110 --> 22:43.780
On my home world, we do not celebrate
the anniversary of one's birth.

22:43.906 --> 22:47.493
- No presents?
- It is a day like any other.

22:47.618 --> 22:51.997
- How do you know how old you are?
- I am 101 years of age.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.584
Uh... You don't look that old.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.670
So I've been told.

22:58.754 --> 23:01.840
- So when do you turn 102?
- In 47 days.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.680
Keep it.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.225
- It's a birthday present.
- I cannot.

23:12.643 --> 23:15.729
Well, in 47 days you'll be gone. Right?

23:18.732 --> 23:21.026
So keep it.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.481
Colonel, are you all right?

24:00.399 --> 24:05.821
What kind of dumb-ass question is that?
My friend is laying here on his deathbed.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.412
I'm fine.

24:13.537 --> 24:17.749
- We're working on the problem, sir.
- I don't want excuses!

24:18.500 --> 24:22.880
Colonel O'Neill, if you don't calm down
I will have you removed. Is that clear?

24:23.005 --> 24:24.548
I'm fine.

24:24.631 --> 24:27.634
Sir, I'd like to recheck
your dopamine levels.

24:35.392 --> 24:39.229
- It's happenin' to me, isn't it?
- Let me find out. Please.

24:56.622 --> 25:00.042
Whatever does this accelerates
neural activity in the brain...

25:00.125 --> 25:02.669
..and causes a dopamine-like
effect in the body.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.506
- Kinda like drugs.
- As long as you're on the planet.

25:05.589 --> 25:10.719
On your return, neural activity falls and
depression starts. Blood work confirms it.

25:10.802 --> 25:15.766
- Does the boy carry any immunity?
- No. His blood work came back the same.

25:15.891 --> 25:19.561
He won't be able to leave the planet
without withdrawal symptoms.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.397
Colonel O'Neill was only there
just over an hour.

25:22.481 --> 25:26.318
Yes, sir. This addiction
appears to be almost instantaneous.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.737
Are you saying I'm addicted to that place?

25:28.862 --> 25:34.284
The intensity of your mood swing seems
proportional to time spent on the planet.

25:34.368 --> 25:39.081
Hopefully your exposure wasn't long
enough for you to get as bad as Daniel.

25:39.164 --> 25:42.751
Great. All those years of "just sayin' no".

25:42.835 --> 25:44.962
I tried to recall Major Carter or Teal'c.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.841
They haven't responded and
I can't risk sending another team.

25:48.924 --> 25:51.385
(beeping)

25:56.139 --> 25:58.767
- What's that?
- His EEG is sporadic.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.895
This happened to the members
of SG-5 before they died.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.982
Sir, you have to take him
back to the planet.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.528
Once there, you must send me
his vital signs...

26:09.611 --> 26:11.029
(rapid beeping)

26:11.113 --> 26:13.157
(flatline beep)

26:14.700 --> 26:17.244
He's coding. No time to resuscitate.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.121
Let's go!

26:36.889 --> 26:38.765
Daniel.

26:39.391 --> 26:41.435
Daniel.

26:44.188 --> 26:46.648
Come on, Daniel. Let's go. Come on!

26:49.860 --> 26:52.070
Carter! Teal'c!

26:59.077 --> 27:00.954
- Where are my friends?
- With the light.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.041
- Get 'em for me, will ya?
- They won't come.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.168
Well, try!

27:12.299 --> 27:14.343
(groans)

27:21.934 --> 27:25.354
- I'm not allowed to go in there.
- For God's sake...

27:26.188 --> 27:28.732
Carter! Carter, wake up!

27:29.816 --> 27:32.528
- You're back, sir. When?
- Teal'c.

27:32.611 --> 27:34.905
Teal'c, come on!

27:37.741 --> 27:40.702
Yeah. Come on. Outta here. Right now.

27:51.296 --> 27:54.299
- Daniel Jackson!
- Yeah.

27:54.424 --> 27:59.137
I had to bring him back. It was the only
thing that was gonna keep him alive.

27:59.221 --> 28:01.974
Sir, how long were you gone?

28:02.057 --> 28:05.561
A few hours.
Hammond tried to contact you.

28:07.563 --> 28:10.023
- He did not.
- (Loran) He did.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.027
I heard his voice.

28:14.111 --> 28:16.655
- Where were we?
- In there.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.785
I can't explain it.

28:21.869 --> 28:25.873
Fraiser says we're addicted to something
that alters our brain chemistry.

28:25.956 --> 28:28.834
And dollars to doughnuts
it's that damn light.

28:28.917 --> 28:31.670
Oh, I don't see how that's possible.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.091
Hey!

28:36.216 --> 28:40.596
You knew, didn't you?
That's why you're not allowed in there.

28:42.014 --> 28:45.601
- My father said I was too young.
- Uh-huh.

28:45.726 --> 28:50.689
Sir, if it's the light itself, how did Daniel
recover just by arriving on the planet?

28:50.772 --> 28:54.276
I don't know, Major.
But I want you to find out.

28:54.359 --> 28:58.822
Otherwise we're stuck here indefinitely
and that's not acceptable.

29:01.158 --> 29:04.244
Oh, screw it. We're shuttin' the thing off.

29:06.205 --> 29:07.581
No.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.958
You stay here.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.382
What are we looking for, sir?

29:18.050 --> 29:21.053
The off switch.

29:28.602 --> 29:32.439
All right. If... we can't shut the thing off,...

29:34.942 --> 29:37.402
..we'll...

29:38.403 --> 29:40.364
O'Neill!

29:40.447 --> 29:42.741
Oh, man...

29:45.911 --> 29:48.205
Damn, that thing's dangerous.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.750
My guess is the control mechanism
is inside this pedestal.

29:51.834 --> 29:55.504
If we focus our attention on that,
we should be all right.

30:03.554 --> 30:07.933
I'm glad to see you're alive and well,
Dr Jackson. We thought we'd lost you.

30:08.016 --> 30:12.187
To be honest, I don't remembermuch
afteryelling at you. Sorry about that.

30:12.271 --> 30:15.774
That's all right.
Is there anything you need?

30:15.899 --> 30:21.363
Glasses. Um... supplies. It looks like
we're not going anywhere fora while.

30:21.446 --> 30:25.117
And that little remote computer thing
I couldn't make work before.

30:25.242 --> 30:29.621
I'll send it through immediately.
Where's Colonel O'Neill?

30:34.293 --> 30:36.753
Guys, I figured out how to...

30:49.808 --> 30:52.769
- How did you do that?
- Remote control.

30:54.563 --> 30:59.526
- I thought that thing was broken.
- You were right. It was the batteries.

30:59.610 --> 31:02.779
- I was?
- It draws power from inside the room.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.990
That's why it wouldn't work on Earth.

31:05.115 --> 31:07.784
- How long were we standing here?
- I'm not sure.

31:07.868 --> 31:10.537
General Hammond sent
some supplies, and...

31:10.621 --> 31:13.874
..Loran and I translated
the writing on this thing, so...

31:13.999 --> 31:15.250
That long?

31:15.334 --> 31:19.963
Perception of time is one of
the first things to go when you're... high.

31:20.088 --> 31:22.299
From what I've translated so far,...

31:22.424 --> 31:26.678
..the Goa'uld used to use this place
as some sort of opium den.

31:26.762 --> 31:31.892
Their symbiotes must have kept the host's
mind chemically balanced once they left.

31:32.017 --> 31:35.771
Then most likely I will
be able to leave this planet.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.022
How nice for you.

31:37.105 --> 31:41.193
Wait a minute. If you just turned it off,
how come I'm not getting depressed?

31:41.276 --> 31:44.530
Perhaps it will take some time
to feel its effects.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.158
Let's take advantage of that time.

31:52.871 --> 31:55.249
Loran.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.376
Jack.

31:58.252 --> 32:00.712
All right...

32:00.796 --> 32:03.507
Where did your parents actually go?

32:04.716 --> 32:08.762
- Far... far away from here.
- How far? Which direction?

32:21.066 --> 32:23.277
The kid's hiding somethin'.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.696
Teal'c, Carter. With me.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.092
What?

32:47.176 --> 32:51.972
I guess the reality that we may
never go home is starting to set in.

32:52.055 --> 32:57.728
Hammond'll keep us supplied with
all we need until we can figure this out.

32:57.853 --> 32:59.897
It's a nice beach.

33:00.022 --> 33:02.983
Be a good excuse for you, wouldn't it?

33:03.066 --> 33:06.236
- Huh?
- To do nothing for a while.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.239
- What?
- Forget it.

33:09.323 --> 33:11.366
- "Forget it, sir."
- Oh, please.

33:11.492 --> 33:13.702
You think I'm keeping that up?

33:13.827 --> 33:15.954
- Listen, Major...
- No way!

33:16.038 --> 33:17.664
"No way, Colonel."

33:17.789 --> 33:20.792
What? I'm supposed to accept
that's the way it's gonna be?

33:20.918 --> 33:23.670
- That's the way it is.
- What difference does it make?

33:23.754 --> 33:27.007
- Carter! You're in withdrawal!
- Oh, I'm in withdrawal?

33:27.090 --> 33:29.927
Yes! So am l.

33:32.846 --> 33:35.390
(Teal'c) O'Neill! Major Carter!

33:40.812 --> 33:44.149
I believe I have located
the parents of Loran.

34:02.626 --> 34:05.504
That's my mother and father. There.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.632
That's me.

34:11.969 --> 34:15.389
- You're a lot younger there.
- Yeah. It's old.

34:15.514 --> 34:18.600
- Yeah, about that...
- Hey, can I take an image of you?

34:18.684 --> 34:20.726
Sure.

34:30.112 --> 34:32.156
That's great.

34:35.324 --> 34:39.371
- You know, I'm sorry that you can't leave.
- Are you?

34:42.708 --> 34:45.793
I mean, it makes sense
that you'd want some company.

34:47.588 --> 34:50.757
Maybe that's why you didn't tell us
the light was dangerous.

34:50.841 --> 34:53.217
- No.
- It's OK. I'm not mad.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.387
That's not why.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.693
- What's wrong?
- Oh...

35:09.776 --> 35:13.280
We're going through
that withdrawal thing again.

35:13.739 --> 35:16.742
I felt fine the whole time you were gone.

35:16.825 --> 35:20.496
Actually, sir, I'm starting
to feel myself again.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.626
Me too. What's goin' on?

35:25.709 --> 35:29.046
Well, something other than
that light must be affecting us.

35:29.129 --> 35:34.968
- And we must remain in close proximity.
- So not only are we stuck here, we're...

35:35.093 --> 35:37.638
We're stuck here.

35:58.033 --> 36:01.954
Well, it's sure not as much fun
to look at with the light off.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.750
I feel no compulsion to remain here.

36:06.834 --> 36:10.337
Sir, I think you may be onto something.

36:10.420 --> 36:13.590
- How's that?
- The light isn't affecting our minds.

36:13.674 --> 36:17.511
It just takes advantage of the altered state
of our brain chemistry.

36:17.636 --> 36:21.932
- So... entertainment?
- Well, probably more than that.

36:22.057 --> 36:26.603
The colour and light interaction
probably triggers the chemical responses.

36:26.728 --> 36:30.065
- But it's not the cause of the imbalance.
- What is the cause?

36:30.190 --> 36:33.277
There must be a device
emitting energy or radiation...

36:33.402 --> 36:36.405
..that we can't detect
with our instruments.

36:40.993 --> 36:43.036
All right, Loran.

36:43.745 --> 36:46.582
Why doesn't this room
seem to affect you?

36:47.457 --> 36:48.834
I'm too young.

36:48.917 --> 36:52.254
- How do you know that?
- My father told me.

36:52.379 --> 36:55.716
It is possible this place
only affects an adult physiology.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.926
Fraiser said he's as addicted as we are.

36:58.010 --> 37:00.721
She's right. The light didn't
have any effect on me.

37:00.804 --> 37:03.599
Then what'd it do to your parents?

37:07.519 --> 37:09.730
We need to know what this thing does.

37:09.813 --> 37:13.150
- When they get back, they'll explain.
- They're not coming back!

37:13.233 --> 37:16.487
- They are.
- Somebody buried those bodies!

37:18.697 --> 37:21.575
Now, how do you shut that thing off?

37:49.895 --> 37:52.773
- Figure that thing out.
- Yes, sir.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.626
Hey.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.548
I'm sorry.

38:32.688 --> 38:36.191
Nice picture. Your parents?

38:40.863 --> 38:42.990
I killed them.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.994
You did?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.080
I find that...

38:54.710 --> 38:57.171
What happened?

39:00.549 --> 39:03.010
When we found this place...

39:05.053 --> 39:08.307
..all they would do was stare at that light.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.476
All day.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.397
The light didn't affect me. My father
said it was because I was too young.

39:15.522 --> 39:19.026
But they didn't let me
in the light room anyway.

39:21.278 --> 39:23.405
I told them to stop every day.

39:24.531 --> 39:27.868
But they'd just tell me
to bring them things.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.871
OK. So you did that.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.334
And?

39:36.418 --> 39:39.087
One day I stopped.

39:41.465 --> 39:46.345
It was days before their hunger
was stronger than the light.

39:46.470 --> 39:49.973
Then they came out
looking for me, looking for food.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.602
And I snuck into the light room.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.149
And I turned it off.

40:01.193 --> 40:03.654
Not just the light. Everything.

40:05.072 --> 40:09.243
I didn't know that it would hurt them.
I just wanted to go home.

40:09.785 --> 40:11.912
Hey. It's not your fault.

40:12.454 --> 40:14.915
They died because of me.

40:15.874 --> 40:20.337
They were screaming, they ran outside,
they didn't make any sense.

40:21.129 --> 40:23.257
So I did. I turned it back on.

40:23.924 --> 40:26.552
But they were already in the water.

40:26.635 --> 40:28.679
So far.

40:32.724 --> 40:35.811
And they just kept on going.
They just kept going.

40:35.936 --> 40:40.148
I screamed at them "I turned it back on!"
But they just kept going.

40:43.152 --> 40:45.946
And then they were gone.

40:48.448 --> 40:51.535
The next day I found them on the shore.

40:51.994 --> 40:54.037
Loran...

40:55.038 --> 40:58.876
You were trying to help them. You were
trying to free them from something.

40:59.001 --> 41:01.545
It wasn't your fault.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.384
I miss them.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.890
I know.

41:33.952 --> 41:37.539
- What you got?
- We think we can turn it off.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.501
Don't let them.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.545
You'll die, like my parents.

41:46.131 --> 41:50.385
If we shut it off, cold turkey. Loran is right.
We'd go into withdrawal again.

41:50.469 --> 41:53.555
But Teal'c and Daniel
have translated some writing, sir,...

41:53.639 --> 41:57.142
..and we think it was designed
to be turned down incrementally.

41:57.226 --> 42:01.855
The Goa'uld who used this place needed
human slaves to tend to their needs.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.983
We've already taken it
down a notch without any harm.

42:05.067 --> 42:08.487
Within three weeks, your brain chemistry
will return to normal.

42:08.570 --> 42:14.576
- You may then return home.
- So three weeks in a palace by the beach.

42:17.704 --> 42:22.084
Teal'c, you don't have to stay. Why don't
you let Hammond know what's goin' on?

42:22.167 --> 42:24.628
Very well.

42:25.712 --> 42:30.425
- And then you'll leave.
- I think we all will. Right?

42:31.468 --> 42:34.346
Yeah. He should return to normal
with the rest of us.

42:34.429 --> 42:36.890
I can go with you?

42:38.725 --> 42:40.769
