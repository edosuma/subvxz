Kendall and Kylie are coming
back Monday.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.767
We're leaving Tuesday night.
>> KHLOE: So Monday will be

21:21.767 --> 21:23.767
fine.
We'll make time Monday.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.500
>> TRISTAN: Mm-hmm.
>> KHLOE: Tristan said to me

21:26.500 --> 21:29.166
that he wants to talk with my
sisters and my mom.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.166
Um, I have my own personal
feelings, 'cause this happened

21:32.166 --> 21:35.467
to me.
But my sisters also have their

21:35.467 --> 21:38.700
feelings, and they are very much
entitled to that.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.667
>> KIM: You ready?
>> TRISTAN: Huh?

21:40.667 --> 21:43.000
>> KIM: You ready?
>> TRISTAN: Always.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.133
>> KHLOE: When there's drama,
people love to be like, "Well,

21:45.133 --> 21:48.033
this is my relationship.
I don't need to involve people."

21:48.033 --> 21:51.133
Well, in this family, you do,
so...

21:51.133 --> 21:53.133
>> TRISTAN: See you all later.
Safe travels.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.166
I'll see you all in a little
bit.

21:55.166 --> 21:59.600
>> KIM: Yeah, hey, bye.
See you later. Have a good game.

21:59.600 --> 22:03.000
Don't slip.
>> KOURTNEY: All right, I feel

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
like we should go.
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.266
>> FRIEND: Are you still okay
with us, like, coming out here

22:10.266 --> 22:14.100
on Monday?
>> KHLOE: Why don't we talk, um,

22:14.100 --> 22:16.100
just a little closer?
>> FRIEND: Okay.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.166
>> KHLOE: 'Cause things are just
being weird these days.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.166
So we'll just talk and see.
>> KOURTNEY: Are you happy we're

22:20.166 --> 22:22.166
coming back or do you think
you're gonna be overwhelmed?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.166
>> KHLOE: No, I'm happy.
I-I feel bad.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.166
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like also
it's good you get to go home,

22:26.166 --> 22:28.166
get settled.
(True crying)

22:28.166 --> 22:30.166
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: And then we'll come

22:30.166 --> 22:32.467
back.
>> KHLOE: I just have to get out

22:32.467 --> 22:35.567
of here.
>> KOURTNEY: Is somebody writing

22:35.567 --> 22:37.734
you?
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

22:37.734 --> 22:41.166
Too many people.
But writing about both things.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.200
I'm like, "Shut up."
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.567
>> KHLOE: I don't have the
energy for that right now.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.400
Like, everyone leave me alone.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.567
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like
everyone just wants you to know

22:52.567 --> 22:55.734
that you're supported.
>> KHLOE: And I appreciate that.

22:55.734 --> 23:00.600
I do. But...
it's also everyone has their own

23:00.600 --> 23:03.767
(bleep) that I know nothing
about, and mine is thrown on the

23:03.767 --> 23:07.066
public of everything.
And it's just... it's a lot

23:07.066 --> 23:10.333
harder to filter through stuff
when it's this public and when I

23:10.333 --> 23:15.734
gave birth the following day.
There's too much.

23:15.734 --> 23:19.600
It's so much harder to deal with
it when it's so public and

23:19.600 --> 23:24.633
everyone is giving you their
opinions and their input and

23:24.633 --> 23:28.233
their unsolicited advice.
Even feeling like, "Oh, God, the

23:28.233 --> 23:31.467
nurses and the doctors"--
Everyone kind of, like, looking

23:31.467 --> 23:34.100
sideways at the whole situation.
That's hard, and it's

23:34.100 --> 23:36.633
humiliating.
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like people,

23:36.633 --> 23:38.667
like, force you to try to, like,
get out of it.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.567
>> KHLOE: Yeah. I just need to
figure out my own... without

23:41.567 --> 23:45.233
feeling, like, guilty if I'm,
you know, letting you guys down

23:45.233 --> 23:47.266
or this.
Or it's like I can't even worry

23:47.266 --> 23:51.767
about that.
He obviously (bleep) up, major.

23:51.767 --> 23:55.166
But I'm not sure how I feel
about anything right now.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.266
In two weeks, I might say, "You
know what, I don't trust you,

23:57.266 --> 23:59.266
and this isn't for me."
Or I might say, "This is

23:59.266 --> 24:01.266
perfect.
Let's keep it going."

24:01.266 --> 24:03.266
But I'm just, like-- I'm
thinking way too much about

24:03.266 --> 24:05.266
this.
This is too (bleep) shady.

24:05.266 --> 24:07.266
>> KIM: I feel like the worst is
over.

24:07.266 --> 24:09.767
>> KHLOE: I don't know.
I feel so exhausted.

24:09.767 --> 24:13.500

nothing happened.

I just said, "You're being too

24:27.600 --> 24:32.266

Tristan.

24:37.700 --> 24:41.200
No cameras were there, and we
really wanted it to be a private

24:41.200 --> 24:44.000
talk.
I told him, "I think you're more

24:44.000 --> 24:46.300
remorseful 'cause it's affecting
your job."

one silver lining is just that
I'm gonna be able to go to my

reunion tomorrow.
I mean, it's been 20 years.

25:37.300 --> 25:41.133
That's a really long time.
I want to see the faces of

25:41.133 --> 25:44.633
people that I, you know, went to
high school with and see how

to talk to you and Kourtney.
I think we all need to sit down

26:06.333 --> 26:10.200

26:23.767 --> 26:28.700
really serious.
I mean, it was definitely

26:28.700 --> 26:31.000
awkward to see him, don't you

Like, it definitely got an
upgrade and looks amazing.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.433
This is so crazy, these halls.
Just even going into the

32:17.433 --> 32:21.667
bathroom, where we used to spend
so much time, is so trippy.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.467
We are the class of '98.

32:26.266 --> 32:29.266
This is where chemistry was,
through this building.

32:29.266 --> 32:32.567
This is where I-I did really bad
in this chemistry class.

It's been a long time that we

33:05.333 --> 33:07.600
all just really hung out
together.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.133
Look, I put a heart next to you,
Clair.

33:10.133 --> 33:14.600
So, I'm really happy to
reconnect with them.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.200

this late.

(Penelope squeals)

42:12.166 --> 42:16.066
>> KIM: So I unfollowed him on
Instagram and I'm like, he

42:16.066 --> 42:18.734
should be embarrassed.
So I literally wrote her and

42:18.734 --> 42:21.266
said, "Look, let's change the
subject.

42:21.266 --> 42:24.500
I love you and I support you."
But I'm, like, done.

42:24.500 --> 42:28.100
Done with him.
Over it.

42:28.100 --> 42:31.066
>> PENELOPE: Done.
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like there's

42:31.066 --> 42:34.066
only so much we can do as much
as we... it's like, everyone has

42:34.066 --> 42:36.066
to learn their own lesson.
(Penelope screams)

42:36.066 --> 42:38.100
>> KIM: She just should have
stood her ground.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.633
You know what I mean, like, you
can't just, like, right away.

42:40.633 --> 42:43.066
>> KOURTNEY: No. No.
You just... She should just do

42:43.066 --> 42:47.333
what's in her heart.
And she should either... like,

42:47.333 --> 42:50.100
give it a chance, and if that's
what makes her feel best for her

42:50.100 --> 42:52.633
family, I've been there.
>> KIM: Like, that's not

42:52.633 --> 42:54.767
realistic.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, I don't think

42:54.767 --> 42:57.200
his intentions are right.
I don't think he's gonna change,

42:57.200 --> 43:00.100
but I'm just saying, if she
wants to feel like she's trying

43:00.100 --> 43:04.667
for her own heart, and know that
she's doing her best, then I

43:04.667 --> 43:07.767
don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

43:07.767 --> 43:11.367
I think it takes a lot more
strength to do... to hang in

43:11.367 --> 43:17.767
there and try for your family
than to just walk away.

43:17.767 --> 43:21.667
(Penelope speaking indistinctly)
>> KIM: I won't make her feel

43:21.667 --> 43:26.367
bad about anything, but I just,
generally, don't care to, like,

43:26.367 --> 43:31.000
be around him.
>> KOURTNEY: I mean, it's her

43:31.000 --> 43:34.166
decision, and I don't think we
want to cause her any more

43:34.166 --> 43:37.000
stress.
>> KIM: I mean, ultimately,

43:37.000 --> 43:41.667
whatever makes her happy.
I'll stay out of the way.

43:41.667 --> 43:44.200
On the next episode...
Just to, like, a night off

43:44.200 --> 43:47.400
to happen.
>> ALL: To Cher.

43:47.400 --> 43:50.667
>> KIM: I was able to pull off a
backstage meeting with Cher.

43:50.667 --> 43:52.700
I feel like I'm gonna faint.
>> MAN: Okay, are you guys

43:52.700 --> 43:55.133
ready?
>> KIM: Oh, my God.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.133
She's like, "Oh, please, I don't
want you guys to fight."

43:57.133 --> 43:59.400
I'm like, "I unfollowed him and
I'm just letting you know."

43:59.400 --> 44:02.400
>> KOURTNEY: Does he follow us?
>> KIM: (gasps) He blocked me.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.667
Tristan is just too petty for
me.

44:04.667 --> 44:06.400
Where's my bestie?
