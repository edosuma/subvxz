Did you ever take, like,
any karate growing up, or...

00:49.427 --> 00:50.688
I did judo for a second.

00:50.757 --> 00:51.786
- You did?
- Yes.

All right, try to do it to me.

Okay.

That's really slow.

It's, like, a hair.

That's more than a hair.

01:01.739 --> 01:03.075
It's like a whole afro
too slow.

01:03.152 --> 01:04.854
Yeah, yeah,
one afro too slow.

01:04.929 --> 01:06.909

Hello, I'm Kirby Howell-Baptiste,

01:12.614 --> 01:16.340
and today we'll be
discussing Suffrajitsu.

01:16.487 --> 01:17.815
Cheers.

01:17.909 --> 01:19.350
This is gonna be some good shit.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.167
Buckle up, baby.

01:21.287 --> 01:23.046
<i>So our story starts in England.</i>

01:23.114 --> 01:24.794
<i>There is a Suffragette protest</i>

01:24.862 --> 01:26.756
<i>lead by Emmeline Pankhurst,</i>

01:26.842 --> 01:29.999
<i>and she's like, oy, listen, women.</i>

01:30.067 --> 01:32.392
<i>We need the right to vote,
so if these fu... men</i>

01:32.469 --> 01:33.815
<i>aren't gonna give us
the right to vote,</i>

01:33.883 --> 01:35.068
<i>then we're just gonna
have to take it.</i>

01:35.135 --> 01:36.148
<i>Right?</i>

01:36.216 --> 01:37.672
<i>And they're rowdy as fu...,
obviously,</i>

01:37.739 --> 01:39.567
<i>because they're, like,
ready for this.</i>

01:39.644 --> 01:41.149
<i>So the Metropolitan
Police are like, listen,</i>

01:41.216 --> 01:43.695
<i>oh, these women want
to step out of line,</i>

01:43.763 --> 01:46.117
<i>but we're gonna show
them who's boss.</i>

01:46.185 --> 01:48.543
<i>They start grabbing
women, twisting their arms,</i>

01:48.611 --> 01:49.817
<i>pulling on their breasts.</i>

01:49.885 --> 01:50.890
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

01:50.958 --> 01:53.114
<i>- Putting on their breasts?
- Pulling,</i> not putting.

01:53.182 --> 01:54.226
Oh, okay.

01:54.294 --> 01:55.946
<i>- Putting on their breasts.
- Putting on their breasts.</i>

01:56.013 --> 01:57.117
<i>I didn't know.</i>

01:57.194 --> 01:59.457
<i>So the fight turns
completely nasty.</i>

01:59.534 --> 02:01.259
<i>Two women got killed.</i>

02:01.336 --> 02:06.091
<i>One was Emmeline Pankhurst's
sister, so she's like, oh, no.</i>

02:06.203 --> 02:07.952
<i>Like, you killed my sister.</i>

02:08.020 --> 02:11.200
<i>I'm fu... coming for you.</i>

02:11.344 --> 02:13.234
<i>This event was known as
Black Friday.</i>

02:13.302 --> 02:15.436
So this was, like,
in history, a big, big day.

02:15.513 --> 02:16.617
It's still a big day.

02:16.685 --> 02:18.004
Yeah, for sales.

02:18.081 --> 02:19.643
<i>Mm-hmm. Great deals.</i>

02:19.720 --> 02:20.720
<i>Great deals.</i>

02:20.791 --> 02:22.835
<i>Anyway,
so Emmeline Pankhurst</i>

02:22.903 --> 02:24.070
<i>goes to Edith Garrud,</i>

02:24.138 --> 02:27.781
<i>this 4'11" woman who
runs a jiu-jitsu school.</i>

02:27.858 --> 02:30.650
<i>And Emmeline is like,
Edith, I need your help.</i>

02:30.831 --> 02:32.986
<i>These police are acting wild.</i>

02:33.063 --> 02:36.113
<i>We need to, like... like, help,
like, train these Suffragettes</i>

02:36.181 --> 02:38.481
<i>so that
they can defend themselves</i>

02:38.549 --> 02:39.794
<i>against the police.</i>

02:39.871 --> 02:42.800
<i>So Edith put together
30 Suffragettes.</i>

02:42.868 --> 02:47.204
<i>And she's like, we're gonna
call you the Bodyguard.</i>

02:47.912 --> 02:51.111
<i>So Edith Garrud was tea...
Edith Garrud teaches...</i>

02:51.253 --> 02:54.772
<i>so Edith Garrud taught...</i>

02:55.643 --> 02:58.064
<i>Edith Garrud starts
training these girls,</i>

02:58.158 --> 03:00.205
<i>and she's like, hi-yah!</i>

03:00.273 --> 03:01.277
<i>Block the titties!</i>

03:01.345 --> 03:02.449
<i>And they'd all go, hi-yah!</i>

03:02.517 --> 03:03.676
<i>Block the titties!</i>

03:03.753 --> 03:05.275
<i>We!
Want!</i>

03:05.496 --> 03:06.864
<i>The!</i>

03:06.963 --> 03:08.158
<i>Vote!</i>

03:08.963 --> 03:10.527
<i>So then the cream rises
to the top,</i>

03:10.595 --> 03:12.910
<i>and one of the people who
were just the cream of the crop</i>

03:12.978 --> 03:15.963
<i>was Gertrude Harding,
ultimate bad bitch.</i>

03:16.031 --> 03:18.083
Any relation to Tonya?

03:22.580 --> 03:24.075
<i>Can you narrate
every story?</i>

03:24.159 --> 03:26.648
No one reacts
to my jokes like that.

03:30.394 --> 03:31.651
So... Aah!

03:31.976 --> 03:34.348
<i>Uh! In February 1914,</i>

03:34.425 --> 03:35.785
<i>Emmaline delivered a speech</i>

03:35.862 --> 03:37.450
<i>in Camden Square,</i>

03:37.538 --> 03:39.999
<i>and at the end she goes,
okay, you lot.</i>

03:40.067 --> 03:41.589
<i>I'm coming down now,</i>

03:41.729 --> 03:45.136
<i>and police, you can try
and grab these titties.</i>

03:45.244 --> 03:46.472
<i>Whatever.</i>

03:46.540 --> 03:49.136
<i>She comes downstairs and
then the Commissioner goes,</i>

03:49.210 --> 03:50.975
<i>"Grab her by the titties, I say!</i>

03:51.043 --> 03:52.932
<i>I say, grab her by the titties!"</i>

03:53.160 --> 03:55.732
<i>And the other guy goes,
whoa, this is my first day.</i>

03:55.800 --> 03:57.685
<i>I didn't know we were gonna be
grabbing people by the titties.</i>

03:57.752 --> 04:01.705
<i>And he goes, welcome to
the Metropolitan Police!</i>

04:03.520 --> 04:05.154
Oh, my God.

04:05.222 --> 04:07.782
So, um,
there's a big tussle.

04:07.859 --> 04:10.084
<i>The police grab her,
they pull off her bonnet,</i>

04:10.161 --> 04:12.522
<i>and they're like, you're
not Emmeline Pankhurst!</i>

04:12.599 --> 04:15.159
<i>And she goes,
yeah, no shit, idiot.</i>

04:15.236 --> 04:16.846
<i>I'm her body double.</i>

04:16.993 --> 04:19.289
<i>Emmeline goes downstairs with
the rest of the Bodyguard.</i>

04:19.357 --> 04:21.214
<i>They get her out perfectly safe.</i>

04:21.355 --> 04:23.812
<i>The police are mad as hell.</i>

04:23.975 --> 04:26.581
<i>But the whole of England
knows about Emmeline now,</i>

04:26.780 --> 04:29.566
<i>so she's going out to
Glasgow for this huge talk</i>

04:29.636 --> 04:30.771
<i>at St. Andrew's Hall,</i>

04:30.848 --> 04:33.232
<i>and the Bodyguard are
standing by the stage,</i>

04:33.300 --> 04:35.878
<i>and there's, like, beautiful
bouquets behind them.</i>

04:35.955 --> 04:39.480
<i>And Emmeline strides over
to the stage, and she's like,</i>

04:39.566 --> 04:42.425
<i>we need to fight and
we need to do all this stuff.</i>

04:42.511 --> 04:45.115
<i>And then the Scottish police,
they're like, let's play that...</i>

04:45.183 --> 04:46.987
<i>that bitch's tits like a bagpipe.</i>

04:47.163 --> 04:49.521
<i>And the Bodyguard are
like, oh, hold on a minute.</i>

04:49.589 --> 04:51.021
<i>You're not playing
anyone's titties</i>

04:51.089 --> 04:52.115
<i>like a bagpipe.</i>

04:52.183 --> 04:53.253
<i>Not today.</i>

04:53.569 --> 04:55.841
<i>And they're flipping them
onto the bouquets of flowers,</i>

04:55.909 --> 04:57.022
<i>and obviously you might think,</i>

04:57.089 --> 04:57.969
<i>oh, well, that's...
what's that gonna do?</i>

04:58.046 --> 04:59.209
<i>That's gonna make them smell nice</i>

04:59.276 --> 05:00.701
<i>and maybe get a tiny bit wet?</i>

05:00.778 --> 05:01.912
<i>'Cause the flowers?</i>

05:01.980 --> 05:07.173
<i>And no, there's barbed wire
concealed in all the flowers.</i>

05:07.308 --> 05:09.331
<i>She's like, oh,
you like titties?</i>

05:09.409 --> 05:11.659
<i>You know
what is also a titty?</i>

05:11.947 --> 05:14.308
<i>Barbed wire.</i>

05:14.589 --> 05:15.932
<i>And he goes, I don't get it.</i>

05:16.016 --> 05:17.940
<i>And she goes, it doesn't
make any fu... sense!</i>

05:18.016 --> 05:20.134
<i>You just got barbed wired.</i>

05:22.703 --> 05:25.225
<i>And they go buck-wild.</i>

05:25.350 --> 05:26.998
<i>They start grabbing police officers,</i>

05:27.075 --> 05:29.228
<i>just flipping them over,</i>

05:29.305 --> 05:31.264
<i>doing all their fu...
jiu-jitsu moves,</i>

05:31.341 --> 05:33.297
<i>all the grappling and
flipping, and all this.</i>

05:33.365 --> 05:35.063
<i>And that's the great
thing about jiu-jitsu,</i>

05:35.131 --> 05:37.467
<i>is that it's not
about your size.</i>

05:39.109 --> 05:40.344
<i>But there's a lot more police</i>

05:40.420 --> 05:42.608
<i>than there are
of the Bodyguard,</i>

05:42.694 --> 05:44.375
<i>and they arrest
all the women.</i>

05:44.443 --> 05:46.438
<i>But Emmeline knew
she was gonna be arrested.</i>

05:46.506 --> 05:48.602
<i>She even said,
"If I'm not arrested,</i>

05:48.670 --> 05:50.657
<i>"if I continue to evade
the police officers,</i>

05:50.725 --> 05:53.190
<i>"I make them look like
a fu... joke, right?</i>

05:53.267 --> 05:56.899
<i>"However, if I am arrested,
I will turn sympathy towards</i>

05:56.967 --> 05:58.428
<i>"the Suffragette movement</i>

05:58.508 --> 06:00.102
<i>"'cause I'm a martyr
at that point.</i>

06:00.170 --> 06:03.730
<i>Like, I'm fu... Joan
of Arc-ing this bitch."</i>

06:03.815 --> 06:04.945
<i>And that's exactly
what happened.</i>

06:05.012 --> 06:06.409
<i>There was, like,
a rally in support</i>

06:06.476 --> 06:07.517
<i>for the Suffragette movement.</i>

06:07.584 --> 06:10.035
<i>All of a sudden, all these men
were like, oh, yeah, why not?</i>

06:10.103 --> 06:11.367
<i>Let's give you the right to vote.</i>

06:11.434 --> 06:13.598
<i>It's really the least
we can do anyway.</i>

06:13.715 --> 06:16.139
<i>And in 1918,
the bills passed.</i>

06:16.207 --> 06:17.827
<i>- The bills passed!
- The bills passed!</i>

06:17.895 --> 06:18.950
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

06:19.027 --> 06:20.645
Everyone is happy.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.717
Whoo!

06:21.785 --> 06:23.204
<i>- Ooh!
- The bills passed.</i>

06:23.272 --> 06:26.906
<i>Women in England and Ireland
now have the right to vote.</i>

06:27.102 --> 06:29.047
<i>Emmaline's like,
oh, these titties?</i>

06:29.117 --> 06:31.695
<i>These titties
get to vote now.</i>

06:31.941 --> 06:33.298
<i>- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.</i>

06:33.366 --> 06:34.431
<i>That's two votes.</i>

06:34.508 --> 06:36.267
<i>That's two votes.</i>

06:36.344 --> 06:37.861
Voter fraud.

Hey, guys. I'm Crissle West, and
today we're going to talk about

06:55.040 --> 06:57.822
the Birmingham children's march.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.645
<i>Cheers, Crissle.</i>

06:59.713 --> 07:01.080
<i>Let's march.</i>

07:01.910 --> 07:03.142
Mm.

07:04.413 --> 07:05.848
Delicious!

07:05.980 --> 07:07.807
All right, so where
does our story begin?

07:07.875 --> 07:09.358
Fu.... Who knows.

07:10.217 --> 07:15.662
So our story begins
in 1963 in Alabama,

07:15.929 --> 07:20.056
<i>where racism is so deeply
embedded in the community.</i>

07:20.163 --> 07:22.742
<i>But the breaking point
for Gwendolyn Sanders</i>

07:22.810 --> 07:25.070
<i>was when she realized,
in the 7th grade,</i>

07:25.156 --> 07:27.383
<i>that her textbook had
previously been used</i>

07:27.460 --> 07:29.093
<i>by a white 5th grader.</i>

07:29.257 --> 07:31.578
<i>And she's like, I knew
I wasn't allowed to go</i>

07:31.655 --> 07:34.281
<i>to the same movie theaters and
shit like that as white people,</i>

07:34.349 --> 07:37.276
<i>but y'all are giving us
raggedy, old textbooks</i>

07:37.344 --> 07:38.730
<i>that you were
giving your 5th graders.</i>

07:38.797 --> 07:41.104
<i>Like, not only do you
not give a fu... about me</i>

07:41.172 --> 07:42.433
<i>or my people, you
don't give a fu... about</i>

07:42.500 --> 07:44.074
<i>my education, either.</i>

07:44.208 --> 07:47.694
<i>And so she realized then
that things needed to change</i>

07:47.762 --> 07:49.543
<i>and she wanted to be a part of it.</i>

07:49.914 --> 07:53.364
So around the time that this
story sh... starts... sharts.

07:53.465 --> 07:56.316
- It sharted.
- Oh, no! Don't let the story shart!

07:56.950 --> 07:59.784
<i>So around this same time,
Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>

07:59.861 --> 08:03.750
<i>Was urging the newly elected
President Kennedy, like, man,</i>

08:03.827 --> 08:06.420
<i>we need some official
legislation to stop</i>

08:06.497 --> 08:08.322
<i>the bullshit that's
happening to black people.</i>

08:08.399 --> 08:09.525
<i>Like, you need to get involved.</i>

08:09.592 --> 08:10.827
<i>You're the fu... president.</i>

08:10.904 --> 08:12.492
<i>And Kennedy sympathized.</i>

08:12.569 --> 08:14.164
<i>He was like, you know,
I agree with you,</i>

08:14.241 --> 08:17.801
<i>but the party is still
made up of poor, white,</i>

08:17.878 --> 08:22.094
<i>Southern voters, and
I cannot alienate them,</i>

08:22.162 --> 08:25.112
which doesn't that
sound super familiar?

08:25.180 --> 08:26.654
- It sounds a little similar.
- And kind of distressing?

08:26.721 --> 08:27.637
Right.

08:27.714 --> 08:30.742
<i>So Dr. King is using the
16th Street Baptist Church</i>

08:30.810 --> 08:32.476
<i>to try to organize protests.</i>

08:32.578 --> 08:34.972
<i>And Martin Luther King being,
like, yo, for real though,</i>

08:35.049 --> 08:36.943
<i>it's time for us
to do something.</i>

08:37.020 --> 08:39.383
<i>And the adults were like,
listen,</i>

08:39.451 --> 08:41.258
<i>it's not that
we don't agree with you,</i>

08:41.326 --> 08:43.282
<i>but at the end of the
day I still have to put</i>

08:43.350 --> 08:46.149
<i>food on the table and
pay the rent in this hoe,</i>

08:46.226 --> 08:48.142
<i>and I don't want them
burning crosses on my lawn</i>

08:48.210 --> 08:49.834
<i>or any shit like that,
so... like, bitch,</i>

08:49.902 --> 08:51.232
<i>But this's not fu... safe!</i>

08:51.300 --> 08:52.833
<i>We can't do this!</i>

08:53.006 --> 08:55.266
<i>And Dr. King was like,
if we can't enact change</i>

08:55.334 --> 08:57.147
<i>in Birmingham,
we can't do it anywhere.</i>

08:57.273 --> 09:01.084
<i>Who can join in the protest
and get arrested with us?</i>

09:01.223 --> 09:05.743
<i>And he was sort of shocked
to see Gwendolyn Sanders</i>

09:05.811 --> 09:07.673
<i>and her sisters get up
and say, "You know what?</i>

09:07.750 --> 09:10.381
<i>"We'll do it.
We will do something about this."</i>

09:10.553 --> 09:14.084
<i>And then more and more
kids stood up to volunteer.</i>

09:14.397 --> 09:15.938
<i>They decided to mobilize,</i>

09:16.006 --> 09:17.449
<i>so that's exactly what they did.</i>

09:17.526 --> 09:20.186
<i>They went back
to school, like, listen,</i>

09:20.438 --> 09:23.123
<i>we know
y'all are sick of the racism,</i>

09:23.230 --> 09:25.594
<i>and there's something
we can actually do about it.</i>

09:25.702 --> 09:30.126
<i>And on May 2nd, they...
the protest went down.</i>

09:30.217 --> 09:31.985
<i>And administrators
started locking the doors</i>

09:32.053 --> 09:34.445
<i>to keep them from getting out,
and kids would just straight up</i>

09:34.513 --> 09:36.867
<i>jump out the window.
Like, bitch, you not gonna keep us here.</i>

09:36.935 --> 09:39.102
<i>Over 1,000 kids left school</i>

09:39.170 --> 09:42.483
<i>to go to Kelly Ingram Park
to protest.</i>

09:43.248 --> 09:44.707
<i>But then Bull Connor,</i>

09:44.784 --> 09:47.235
<i>the head of the Birmingham
Police Department, was like,</i>

09:47.303 --> 09:49.131
<i>okay, well, y'alls black
asses can go to jail.</i>

09:49.199 --> 09:52.131
<i>So they started carting
these kids off by the dozens,</i>

09:52.227 --> 09:55.554
<i>and over 1,000 kids were
arrested on that first day,</i>

09:55.631 --> 09:56.785
<i>which is insane.</i>

09:56.862 --> 09:58.766
<i>And after a few days of protest,</i>

09:58.834 --> 10:00.659
<i>the Birmingham jails
are totally overcrowded.</i>

10:00.736 --> 10:04.383
<i>And so as more kids are
arrested, others come back out</i>

10:04.451 --> 10:05.905
<i>to take up their place.</i>

10:06.137 --> 10:09.864
<i>But on May 5th, that was
when shit got really real.</i>

10:10.030 --> 10:12.985
<i>Bull Connor was looking
at hundreds of black kids</i>

10:13.053 --> 10:14.407
<i>standing up to his bullshit.</i>

10:14.475 --> 10:16.688
<i>He's like,
let's bring out the hoses.</i>

10:16.756 --> 10:18.110
<i>And these are high-pressure,</i>

10:18.178 --> 10:20.642
<i>knock-you-the-fu... out
water hoses.</i>

10:20.719 --> 10:23.165
<i>But the kids realized that
there's strength in numbers</i>

10:23.233 --> 10:26.873
<i>and togetherness matters,
so those kids linked hands</i>

10:26.941 --> 10:28.629
<i>and said, "Not today, bitch.</i>

10:28.697 --> 10:29.889
<i>Not today."</i>

10:30.209 --> 10:32.803
<i>So Bull Connor decides,
oh, okay.</i>

10:32.871 --> 10:34.599
<i>Release the K9 units</i>

10:34.667 --> 10:37.397
<i>so that the dogs can fu...
these kids up.</i>

10:39.939 --> 10:41.162
Excuse me.

10:42.212 --> 10:44.758
<i>And at this point,
there were news crews there</i>

10:44.826 --> 10:47.118
<i>that caught the entire
situation on camera,</i>

10:47.186 --> 10:50.438
<i>and these are now some
of the most infamous shots</i>

10:50.506 --> 10:52.047
<i>of the Civil Rights movement.</i>

10:52.115 --> 10:56.256
<i>And after people saw
children on international TV</i>

10:56.397 --> 10:59.184
<i>being sprayed with hoses
and attacked by dogs,</i>

10:59.254 --> 11:01.818
a mind shift occurred,

11:01.959 --> 11:05.532
<i>and after
eight solid days of protest,</i>

11:05.600 --> 11:09.329
<i>President Kennedy felt
motivated to come out and say,</i>

11:09.397 --> 11:10.415
<i>"You know what?</i>

11:10.483 --> 11:11.743
<i>"I didn't want to say it before</i>

11:11.811 --> 11:13.205
<i>"because of
the Southern white voters,</i>

11:13.272 --> 11:14.800
<i>"but them motherfu... are racist,</i>

11:14.877 --> 11:16.889
<i>"so it's time to just be real.</i>

11:17.020 --> 11:18.649
<i>"This shit
that you are going out here</i>

11:18.717 --> 11:24.271
<i>and doing to people in my
name is not the fu... okay."</i>

11:25.560 --> 11:27.740
<i>Oh, man, I love drinking.</i>

11:28.021 --> 11:29.943
<i>How come
I don't do this more?</i>

11:33.437 --> 11:34.959
Whoo!

11:35.059 --> 11:38.450
So anyway,
who was I talking about?

11:38.527 --> 11:39.899
- The kids.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.921
So after the success of the
Birmingham children's march,

11:42.989 --> 11:45.327
<i>Dr. King decided
to ride that momentum,</i>

11:45.395 --> 11:47.856
<i>and he gave his
"I Have a Dream" speech.</i>

11:47.942 --> 11:51.327
<i>Bull Connor was fired,
and the Civil Rights Act</i>

11:51.395 --> 11:54.069
<i>was passed
within a year of all that,</i>

11:54.137 --> 11:56.957
<i>so it was monumental
that Gwendolyn Sanders</i>

11:57.144 --> 11:59.022
<i>and these kids
were willing to say</i>

11:59.090 --> 12:02.077
<i>this is not a fu...
game, and you won't treat us</i>

12:02.145 --> 12:04.600
<i>and our people this
way because we're here</i>

12:04.668 --> 12:05.788
<i>and this is what's going on,</i>

12:05.856 --> 12:07.973
<i>and it's time for us
to stand up too.</i>

12:08.428 --> 12:10.523
And so I don't have to worry
about that sort of thing

12:10.615 --> 12:13.341
the way those kids even did
or their parents even did,

12:13.409 --> 12:15.196
and I don't take
that for granted.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.381
Cheers to the kids!

12:16.449 --> 12:17.770
Cheers to the kids.

12:18.285 --> 12:20.028
- All right.
- This is gone.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.634
I'm not drinking shit else!

12:21.711 --> 12:22.910
No! No more.

12:22.978 --> 12:24.684
I'm done, Viacom!

12:30.534 --> 12:32.200
<i>- Here you go, young lady.
- Here we go.</i>

12:32.321 --> 12:33.501
Cheers to you.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.289
- And you.
- To everybody.

12:35.357 --> 12:36.842
To everybody and you.

12:36.919 --> 12:38.181
And myself. Thank you.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.940
- Mm-hmm. And me.
- And that includes you.

12:40.008 --> 12:41.257
- Great, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:41.335 --> 12:42.383
Hello.

12:42.460 --> 12:45.858
I'm Suzi Barrett, and
today we're talking about

12:45.935 --> 12:49.425
the Section 504 sit-in.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.896
I'll sit in for this.

12:50.973 --> 12:53.843
I'll sit in with you.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.114
<i>Okay.</i>

12:55.257 --> 12:57.561
Act one, scene one.

12:58.163 --> 13:03.671
A backdrop appears slowly in
front of the audience's eyes.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.420
<i>What's on this backdrop?</i>

13:05.488 --> 13:07.310
<i>The 50s and the 60s.</i>

13:07.387 --> 13:09.866
<i>We got people with disabilities</i>

13:09.952 --> 13:14.716
<i>being treated not as normal citizens.</i>

13:14.834 --> 13:17.422
<i>If you're in a wheelchair,
you can't just, like,</i>

13:17.545 --> 13:20.891
<i>walk into a bank and apply for a job.</i>

13:20.984 --> 13:24.930
<i>There's no access, and
they're like, uh, fu... you.</i>

13:25.004 --> 13:26.098
<i>You use a wheelchair.</i>

13:26.175 --> 13:28.300
<i>Or, like, you can't see</i>

13:28.377 --> 13:32.609
<i>and therefore fu... off, dude.</i>

13:32.753 --> 13:38.055
<i>A disability is
dismiss-ability, basically.</i>

13:38.417 --> 13:42.010
Put that in your fu... pipe.

13:42.095 --> 13:43.805
I will.
And I'll smoke that.

13:43.993 --> 13:45.453
- Will you?
- I will.

13:45.557 --> 13:46.651
<i>I like this pipe.</i>

13:46.728 --> 13:49.893
Okay.
<i>So here comes 1973.</i>

13:49.961 --> 13:53.459
<i>Richard Nixon signs this thing
called the Rehabilitation Act,</i>

13:53.536 --> 13:56.502
and section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act

13:56.570 --> 13:59.498
<i>is the section that
says you can't, uh...</i>

13:59.575 --> 14:03.800
<i>a federal institution
can't, like, uh, you know,</i>

14:03.877 --> 14:06.508
<i>discriminate against
people with a disability.</i>

14:06.610 --> 14:09.493
<i>So section 504 needs to be signed.</i>

14:09.579 --> 14:12.874
So... so... so Joseph Califano,

14:12.951 --> 14:16.051
<i>the head of the Department
of Health, Education,</i>

14:16.128 --> 14:19.414
<i>and Welfare...</i>
HEW... was like, well,

14:19.491 --> 14:21.119
<i>this sounds like a lot of work.</i>

14:21.196 --> 14:23.823
<i>So, like, what do we have
to do to our buildings?</i>

14:23.900 --> 14:24.991
<i>What's braille?</i>

14:25.068 --> 14:28.456
<i>I mean, if this is
that, and that is what,</i>

14:28.533 --> 14:31.500
<i>and what this is what
we're talking about, and...</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:38.305
<i>So it sits there
for four fu... years,</i>

14:38.445 --> 14:40.422
<i>and he doesn't sign it.</i>

14:40.617 --> 14:44.946
<i>So the American Coalition of
Citizens with Disabilities,</i>

14:45.116 --> 14:48.404
<i>headed by Dr. Frank Bowe,</i>

14:48.520 --> 14:52.715
<i>are like, what the fu... fu...?</i>

14:52.792 --> 14:54.719
<i>Make us equal.
We have rights.</i>

14:54.817 --> 14:56.151
<i>We are citizens.</i>

14:57.596 --> 15:01.352
<i>Sign this by April 5th or else.</i>

15:01.600 --> 15:05.728
<i>And "else" is not
a "Frozen" character.</i>

15:05.805 --> 15:09.462
<i>"Else" is a fu... disability surprise.</i>

15:10.576 --> 15:12.467
<i>I feel way drunker than I should be.</i>

15:12.544 --> 15:14.352
You're all good. You're all good.

15:17.071 --> 15:18.071
Okay.

15:18.179 --> 15:22.478
<i>So the deadline, April
5th, comes and it goes.</i>

15:22.555 --> 15:25.651
<i>And at the federal
building in San Francisco,</i>

15:25.728 --> 15:28.287
<i>this woman, Judy Heumann, rolls up,</i>

15:28.373 --> 15:30.875
<i>and doorman's like, oh...</i>

15:30.978 --> 15:32.273
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

15:32.364 --> 15:33.711
<i>Do you need some help?</i>

15:33.779 --> 15:36.972
<i>Would you like some
punch or maybe a cookie?</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:38.969
<i>And she's like, nope.</i>

15:39.249 --> 15:40.305
<i>Uh...</i>

15:40.382 --> 15:44.533
<i>me and my 150 friends</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:48.250
<i>would actually like to
roll over your ass...</i>

15:49.178 --> 15:51.302
<i>'Cause we're about to make a change.</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:55.348
<i>And this started the first protest</i>

15:55.425 --> 15:57.344
<i>for the disability movement.</i>

15:57.539 --> 16:00.670
<i>All over the nation at all
these federal buildings,</i>

16:00.911 --> 16:02.469
<i>protests erupt.</i>

16:02.875 --> 16:05.902
<i>People with disabilities
are like, fu... you!</i>

16:06.065 --> 16:07.729
<i>We're gonna camp out
in your hallways.</i>

16:07.797 --> 16:09.996
<i>We're gonna sit on
your motherfu... desk.</i>

16:10.073 --> 16:12.898
<i>But none of these
protests across the country</i>

16:12.975 --> 16:17.362
<i>lasted more than 28 hours
except for San Francisco,</i>

16:17.430 --> 16:21.245
<i>where the days start dragging
on, and people have needs.</i>

16:21.313 --> 16:22.771
<i>Like, oh, my God.</i>

16:22.848 --> 16:24.142
<i>I don't have my ventilator.</i>

16:24.219 --> 16:26.575
<i>I can't fu... breathe.</i>

16:26.652 --> 16:28.647
<i>I don't even know why
I'm speaking right now.</i>

16:28.724 --> 16:30.096
<i>I'm wasting oxygen.</i>

16:30.164 --> 16:32.508
<i>And, like, the news is covering this.</i>

16:32.593 --> 16:35.529
<i>And people start really feeling
for what's happening here.</i>

16:35.598 --> 16:37.452
And the floodgates open,

16:37.529 --> 16:41.292
<i>and you got people bringing in
medicine, coming in with food.</i>

16:41.369 --> 16:43.124
<i>The Black Panthers show up.</i>

16:43.201 --> 16:46.344
<i>Everyone's sitting in, not
just people with disabilities.</i>

16:46.412 --> 16:48.438
<i>It's allies and people
with disabilities.</i>

16:48.506 --> 16:51.138
<i>It's veterans coming home from Vietnam</i>

16:51.287 --> 16:53.472
<i>being like, man, we got you.</i>

16:53.549 --> 16:56.539
<i>Jefferson Airplane
shows up, like,</i>

16:56.616 --> 16:58.235
<i>we're Jefferson Airplane.</i>

16:58.303 --> 17:00.414
<i>Get it... you know, get your shit on.</i>

17:00.482 --> 17:02.592
<i>We love you!</i>

17:02.754 --> 17:05.613
<i>If Woodstock was in an office building</i>

17:05.690 --> 17:08.834
<i>and filled with wheelchairs
and medical supplies,</i>

17:08.902 --> 17:10.381
<i>this is Woodstock.</i>

17:10.521 --> 17:13.844
<i>And all these people
are finding a community</i>

17:13.912 --> 17:18.193
<i>that they hadn't had
in person until now.</i>

17:18.268 --> 17:22.352
<i>And finally, they get the
attention of Washington.</i>

17:22.420 --> 17:24.470
<i>So they're like, okay,
okay, let's, um,</i>

17:24.547 --> 17:26.615
<i>let's make a little hearing,</i>

17:26.692 --> 17:31.420
<i>and we'll hear your little
disability complaints.</i>

17:31.618 --> 17:34.545
<i>When people start noticing
that they're being dicks,</i>

17:34.656 --> 17:38.349
then they start trying
to fix their dicks.

17:38.823 --> 17:41.310
That's my favorite Dr. Seuss quote.

17:43.306 --> 17:45.029
I'm so dumb.

17:48.591 --> 17:49.699
Hey.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.664
- Oh, hey, Suzi.
- Oh, hey.

17:51.819 --> 17:53.576
This is a real fu......

17:53.644 --> 17:55.536
- Is that too much?
- No.

17:56.091 --> 17:57.155
<i>Okay.</i>

17:57.223 --> 18:01.224
<i>So Judy Heumann
gets 20 of her friends</i>

18:01.306 --> 18:03.529
<i>from her activist
group in San Francisco,</i>

18:03.604 --> 18:05.429
<i>and they haul ass to Washington.</i>

18:05.587 --> 18:07.795
<i>Boom.
We're in Washington, D.C.</i>

18:08.919 --> 18:12.059
<i>And she's like, if
you are going to claim</i>

18:12.136 --> 18:16.006
<i>to be a country
of the land of the free,</i>

18:16.115 --> 18:18.999
<i>then you have to
include us in it.</i>

18:19.067 --> 18:21.701
<i>Otherwise, yikes,</i>

18:21.769 --> 18:25.866
<i>do we have a weird revolution
that's about to happen.</i>

18:26.142 --> 18:29.131
<i>So here's Senator Alan Cranston.</i>

18:29.208 --> 18:30.967
<i>You know, he's nodding his head.</i>

18:31.035 --> 18:32.105
<i>"Oh, yeah.</i>

18:32.173 --> 18:33.544
<i>Oh, my gosh, yeah.</i>

18:33.612 --> 18:35.171
<i>Oh, I'm so feeling it."</i>

18:35.248 --> 18:37.242
<i>Judy Heumann's not
having any of it.</i>

18:37.319 --> 18:39.844
<i>She's like, I'd appreciate
if you wouldn't act</i>

18:39.921 --> 18:41.980
<i>like you understand
what I'm saying</i>

18:42.057 --> 18:43.724

19:07.771 --> 19:10.076
<i>How do you not cry after that?</i>

19:10.235 --> 19:14.326
<i>You know, why would you want

19:14.394 --> 19:17.416
<i>that categorizes people</i>

19:17.537 --> 19:22.006
