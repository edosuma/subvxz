00:25.200 --> 00:28.243
RECALL THE DOOR TO THE DEMON

00:34.335 --> 00:37.166
There are two kinds of people on earth ...

00:38.792 --> 00:41.586
those who believe in the spirit world ...

00:43.254 --> 00:46.173
and those who do not.

00:48.926 --> 00:52.678
The devil likes of both types.

01:48.807 --> 01:50.517
SÃƒO MIGUEL

02:15.161 --> 02:16.871
BLESSED DEATH

03:24.212 --> 03:26.671
I've got something for you

03:26.672 --> 03:29.131
tada!

03:29.132 --> 03:30.592
I can't beleive we're doing this again

03:30.592 --> 03:33.719
Come on, Sara, they're just cards, they're not going to bite you.

03:34.803 --> 03:35.762
Come On.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.430
OK. Good

03:37.430 --> 03:41.809
OK. So the first card represents the past.

03:44.144 --> 03:45.103
The tower

03:45.812 --> 03:48.230
It looks like you had some stormy times recently.

03:48.647 --> 03:49.857
You could say that.

03:49.857 --> 03:52.067
Moving on to the present.

03:55.028 --> 03:57.405
The Fool. Perfect.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.072
That's the way I feel now.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.616
No, this is a great card.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.951
It represents new beginnings and exciting opportunities.

04:04.952 --> 04:06.412
- I like that. - Alright.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.455
But what about the future?

04:11.833 --> 04:12.751
THE DEVIL

04:14.335 --> 04:16.086
- My God- No no no no.

04:16.086 --> 04:19.130
It is not "The Devil" is the god Dionysus.

04:19.255 --> 04:22.508
He is the god of pleasure and abandon

04:23.009 --> 04:25.552
It looks like we'll have a wild night ahead of us.

04:26.011 --> 04:27.304
I've put all that behind me

04:28.346 --> 04:31.056
Sara, the cards do not lie.

04:33.808 --> 04:35.809
Your chariot awaits Ladies

04:35.809 --> 04:37.311
Hey

04:41.230 --> 04:42.189
Come On.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.902
Nice wheels!

04:49.737 --> 04:51.155
This'll put hair  on your tits

04:52.156 --> 04:54.199
Joey, you know I do not drink anymore.

04:54.991 --> 04:56.201
Some party this is going to be

04:56.201 --> 04:57.619
Leave her alone.

04:58.869 --> 05:00.371
What a nice car, Marcus.

05:00.371 --> 05:02.956
I'm using the old hearse as a camera truck

05:02.956 --> 05:04.457
It is one of the perks of the job

05:04.791 --> 05:06.834
Do you really need all this equipment?

05:06.834 --> 05:08.794
You want me to make you look beautiful, don't you?

05:08.794 --> 05:09.795
You'd better

05:10.045 --> 05:11.088
I will

05:17.635 --> 05:19.260
We got together

05:19.260 --> 05:21.012
Now and forever

05:21.012 --> 05:23.473
You can not separate us If you try

05:24.431 --> 05:26.308
The past behind us

05:26.308 --> 05:28.060
Will remember

05:28.060 --> 05:30.478
Why we fight to death

05:30.645 --> 05:32.063
Until dead

05:34.315 --> 05:36.983
To kick and knock down any wall

05:37.776 --> 05:40.528
And we will be who will stand

05:41.195 --> 05:43.739
We are one for all and all for one

05:44.615 --> 05:47.325
And we will be who will stand

05:47.617 --> 05:49.619
We are standing

06:00.958 --> 05:59.835
This is not my place

06:01.835 --> 06:03.211
MORGUE - We thought it would be cool to film...

06:03.211 --> 06:04.753
somewhere a little more edgy

06:05.713 --> 06:07.548
- A morgue? - It's where I work.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.674
It gives a nice tone for the film.

06:10.091 --> 06:12.176
And it makes it a lot harder for you to fake anything.

06:13.177 --> 06:14.178
Fine.

06:14.262 --> 06:16.054
There should be plenty of spirits around here

06:16.263 --> 06:19.723
And for the record, I never faked anything in my life.

06:20.723 --> 06:21.900
Well you never had to with me

06:22.308 --> 06:22.601
That's what you think.

06:56.461 --> 06:57.753
Hold that. Thanks.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.262
Hey, you want to help?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.806
It's fine ...

07:12.140 --> 07:13.266
Stop that.

07:20.729 --> 07:23.981
You have a lot of security, for a bunch of corpses.

07:23.981 --> 07:25.774
Keeps them fom escaping

07:25.983 --> 07:27.108
What's the code?

07:27.609 --> 07:29.277
Try 6-6-6.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.486
You're kidding, right?

07:30.737 --> 07:33.238
Mortician humour. Punch it in.

07:38.743 --> 07:41.829
Welcome to the House of Death.

08:04.430 --> 08:05.722
Where is everyone?

08:05.889 --> 08:06.806
Dead.

08:07.432 --> 08:09.850
- How funny. - Here was a hospital.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.435
But the municipality constructed a new building at the end of the road ...

08:11.435 --> 08:14.104
then just left over the morgue and funeral center.

08:14.730 --> 08:16.898
- You're kidding, right? - I swear to God.

08:16.898 --> 08:18.483
Why do not they close the place?

08:18.816 --> 08:20.692
You know how much to die today?

08:20.859 --> 08:22.110
It's a tremendous fortune.

08:22.277 --> 08:23.987
We call this place the dump

08:23.987 --> 08:25.572
We get al the unclaimed bodies...

08:25.572 --> 08:28.324
junkies, homeless people, poor people; whoever.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.826
This is where Marcus likes to do the creepy student movies

08:31.618 --> 08:33.370
Staff's gone on weekends.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.455
I can work and no one ever bothers me.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.957
- Stop it, Marcus. - What it was?

08:38.957 --> 08:40.625
Are you trying to look like a serial killer ...

08:40.625 --> 08:42.001
but it is not working.

08:42.001 --> 08:43.626
I'm just trying to get in the mood.

08:43.835 --> 08:45.712
And he does not know why has no girlfriend.

08:46.046 --> 08:47.797
Ok, Alright

08:47.797 --> 08:50.800
Here we have the main entrance hall and the family waiting area

08:52.175 --> 08:53.926
Come on, guys, get back on your mark

08:53.926 --> 08:55.260
I put them for a reason. Come On!

08:55.260 --> 08:56.762
- "Marks"? - Here no light.

08:56.762 --> 08:57.888
I need you there, okay?

08:57.888 --> 08:59.180
- That's right. - Yikes.

08:59.639 --> 09:00.598
Here is good?

09:00.765 --> 09:01.891
Right. They are ready?

09:01.891 --> 09:05.268
How you feel? Because you' look fantastic. Ready?

09:05.268 --> 09:06.353
Thank You.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.980
We are here today with Eva Delgado ...

09:08.980 --> 09:11.564
self-proclaimed Santeria priestess.

09:11.564 --> 09:13.692
I never called myself a priestess.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.485
What can you tell us about Santeria?

09:15.485 --> 09:18.278
It is true that you practice animal sacrifice?

09:18.278 --> 09:19.905
Marcus, give me the camera.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.031
What, I'm the director. This equipment is my ...

09:22.031 --> 09:24.283
- This camera is mine. - Have a camera does not make you director.

09:24.283 --> 09:25.451
Kiss my ass

09:25.451 --> 09:27.953
She can't Bro. She is a Christian crazy now.

09:27.953 --> 09:31.540
She'll have to marry you first if there's
going to be any ass kissing

09:31.623 --> 09:33.124
You're an A-hole.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.335
A-hole? You can say that? This is not sin?

09:36.419 --> 09:37.794
Not when it's true.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.421
ooh! Vicious

09:40.004 --> 09:42.339
Spicy Christian. Sure, zooms here. Come on, here.

09:42.339 --> 09:43.590
Joey, do not tell me what to do.

09:43.882 --> 09:46.135
Look, I'm giving you an opportunity to ...

09:46.135 --> 09:48.010
a great documentary, okay?

09:48.010 --> 09:51.097
You're giving me an opportunity to witness
more of your bullshit

09:51.681 --> 09:53.515
Can you you get serious, porfavor?

09:53.515 --> 09:55.892
I'm filming, say something smart, just once.

09:57.394 --> 09:58.394
Okay.

09:58.477 --> 10:01.772
We are here today because our friend, Eva ...

10:02.148 --> 10:04.190
thinks she talks to ghosts.

10:04.816 --> 10:06.818
I said "smart" Joey. "Smart"
Inteligente.

10:06.818 --> 10:09.111
We are here today because our friend, Joey ...

10:09.111 --> 10:11.613
afraid of things he does not understand.

10:11.905 --> 10:12.990
Very scared.

10:13.407 --> 10:16.033
Marcus is making his thesis documentary about me.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.536
It's not about you. It's about our bet.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.038
To prove that I am a real medium.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.582
So our friend Joey here ...

10:23.582 --> 10:26.208
will stop hassling me, once and for all

10:26.917 --> 10:30.003
And what if you can't prove that you are for real?

10:30.295 --> 10:34.591
As I promised, I dance on stage at all his shows next year.

10:36.675 --> 10:39.052
In a bikini. - I never agreed to a bikini.

10:39.219 --> 10:40.636
I'm just thinking of the fans.

10:40.761 --> 10:43.556
This has just come into my head.

10:43.556 --> 10:44.974
It was a sudden idea.

10:44.974 --> 10:48.685
But if you're right, you do not have to worry about, right?

10:49.477 --> 10:51.103
Right. Okay.

10:51.103 --> 10:52.605
- Okay. - I agree with that ...

10:52.813 --> 10:54.231
as long as you agree ...

10:54.231 --> 10:56.941
that if I win, you'll quit your band ...

10:56.941 --> 10:59.777
and join the church choir for one year.

10:59.986 --> 11:01.904
I'd pay to see that.

11:12.949 --> 11:14.242
Deal

11:19.288 --> 11:21.874
This will be the best student film of all time

11:21.874 --> 11:23.041
Come on let's go

11:35.343 --> 11:38.429
Here we have the casket room where grieving families come ...

11:38.429 --> 11:41.348
to select urns and caskets for their love ones

11:45.643 --> 11:46.977
This is nice

11:47.853 --> 11:49.771
Nice? This is a scam

11:49.771 --> 11:51.481
You know how much they charge for a box like that?

11:51.814 --> 11:52.982
$ 2,000.

11:53.107 --> 11:56.193
On the low end, if you want mahogany, they are 15,000.

11:57.319 --> 11:59.196
$ 15,000 for a box?

11:59.404 --> 12:01.489
It's hard to say goodbye to family, Joey.

12:01.906 --> 12:04.241
The burial ritual can be an important part of it.

12:04.408 --> 12:07.035
They are not saying "goodbye" are saying "I'm sorry".

12:07.035 --> 12:09.829
Are 15,000 ways to say "I'm sorry, Mom.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.373
I'm sorry I left you in that shitty nursing home
to die alone

12:12.373 --> 12:14.041
You always look on the bright side of things, Joey.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.417
That's why we love you.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.126
- Thanks. - You are welcome.

12:17.251 --> 12:19.170
I think the caskets are beautiful.

12:19.295 --> 12:21.254
Be damned coffins. Where are the bodies?

12:21.588 --> 12:23.340
Downstairs, in the embalming room.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.384
Embalming room? Now we're talking

12:25.467 --> 12:26.717
Are we allowed down ther?

12:26.717 --> 12:28.886
He is a security guard. We can go anywhere, right?

12:29.387 --> 12:31.180
Sure. Let's go

12:32.764 --> 12:33.765
Come On.

12:33.765 --> 12:34.974
Or or or.

12:36.601 --> 12:38.018
Do you ever see any ghosts up here?

12:38.227 --> 12:40.020
No, but the basement is haunted.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.522
Perfect. Eva will have many people to talk to.

12:49.027 --> 12:50.112
Got it.

13:04.453 --> 13:06.330
There's a weird energy here.

13:06.789 --> 13:07.997
We're in a morgue.

13:07.997 --> 13:09.290
Not serious.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.334
They have bodies that have been here for years.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.001
How old?

13:13.168 --> 13:16.547
I do not know. They are stacked up like side of beef in a freezer.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.214
Um freezer?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.967
Yeah. Want to check it out?

13:21.259 --> 13:22.343
Let's go.

13:33.268 --> 13:34.394
After you.

13:47.863 --> 13:49.781
I've never seen a dead body before

13:52.658 --> 13:54.452
Why this plastic on his face?

13:54.452 --> 13:56.202
Dry skin so fast that they need ...

13:56.202 --> 13:59.247
fill Ios moisturizer and wrap with plastic.

13:59.247 --> 14:01.999
He looks fake. Like he's made of wax or something.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.501
When you're gone you're gone. Nothing left but the carcase

14:05.960 --> 14:07.295
Do not touch the clients

14:07.295 --> 14:08.963
You almost scared me to death, Marcus.

14:08.963 --> 14:10.590
Sorry, but we have rules here.

14:10.756 --> 14:12.799
These things are covered in bacteria.

14:13.884 --> 14:14.885
Thank You.

14:24.976 --> 14:26.686
Okay, here we are.

14:26.769 --> 14:30.856
Welcome to the embalming room, where they drain your blood ...

14:30.856 --> 14:32.815
and pump you full of preservatives.

14:33.065 --> 14:35.026
- It's cold here. - Yeah

14:35.985 --> 14:37.444
Joey, do not do that.

14:43.490 --> 14:44.491
My God.

14:51.703 --> 14:52.746
Nice tits

14:55.498 --> 14:57.499
I do not believe you dated him.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.419
- It was the first year. - My God.

15:00.419 --> 15:02.045
We all make mistakes

15:02.170 --> 15:05.131
It's my animal magnetism. She could not help.

15:05.131 --> 15:08.383
Of course, Joey, you were impossible to resist.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.094
She still wants me.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.511
I'll talk to her about it.

15:13.763 --> 15:15.097
Dude, what's that, a sword?

15:17.891 --> 15:20.018
It's a trocar, do not touch it.

15:20.018 --> 15:22.895
They use to pierce the organs and drain fluids from the body.

15:23.395 --> 15:24.855
That's disgusting.

15:24.855 --> 15:27.316
So, boys, where are we doing the seance?

15:28.316 --> 15:30.108
How about if we set up in the casket room?

15:30.108 --> 15:31.360
Okay for you?

15:31.735 --> 15:32.986
The lighting is better.

15:33.820 --> 15:35.071
For me, no matter.

15:35.071 --> 15:36.989
At least not have bodies up there.

15:46.288 --> 15:48.332
FORMOL

16:16.144 --> 16:18.145
These caskets really are beautiful

16:19.313 --> 16:22.274
I understand why people pay so much to make their
loved ones look good

16:22.525 --> 16:24.818
Me. When I'm gone I'm going to get burned

16:24.818 --> 16:26.695
Nobody looks good dead

16:27.070 --> 16:28.488
I just want a simple service

16:27.488 --> 16:29.739
Simple but elegant, classic.

16:31.739 --> 16:32.782
Not me

16:32.782 --> 16:35.784
I want a giant pyramid, for my fans go idolize me.

16:35.867 --> 16:38.745
They can send me messages and I can answer your prayers and such.

16:38.745 --> 16:39.913
Of course you are

16:39.913 --> 16:41.497
And will your music be on a loop?

16:41.747 --> 16:42.832
For all eternity.

16:42.832 --> 16:45.126
- I hope I'm dead by then. - Hey, that's harsh, right?

16:45.126 --> 16:48.420
What's the one good song that Joey sings.

16:49.421 --> 16:51.380
Oh, That's right, they all suck!

16:53.257 --> 16:55.008
You are so out of my fan club.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.677
Marcus, where's the bathroom?

16:57.885 --> 16:59.679
The only one that is open, it is down stairs...

16:59.679 --> 17:01.888
third door on the left, near the freezer.

17:02.556 --> 17:04.598
- But take the camera. -  So you post me going to the bathroom?

17:04.598 --> 17:06.017
- I don't think so. - You can turn ...

17:06.017 --> 17:08.102
when in the bathroom, but we have to ...

17:09.102 --> 17:10.728
document everything we do, right?

17:12.605 --> 17:13.646
Ok

17:16.983 --> 17:18.943
You need to work on your game, Marcus.

17:19.902 --> 17:21.112
I liked it.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.656
Smooth. Very smooth.

17:29.618 --> 17:31.954
I'm Sarah and I'm going to the bathroom.

17:31.954 --> 17:34.747
For some reason, Marcus think this is essential viewing.

17:35.456 --> 17:36.499
What is this?

17:40.294 --> 17:41.545
Gross!

18:05.770 --> 18:07.856
- Babies. BABIES IN BOTTOM SHELF

18:08.190 --> 18:10.399
My God!

18:12.443 --> 18:14.235
Oh no.

18:17.947 --> 18:18.947
Open the door!

18:19.990 --> 18:21.283
Let me out of here!

18:22.034 --> 18:24.285
Let me out! This is not funny!

18:24.493 --> 18:25.703
Let me out!

18:27.830 --> 18:28.873
Please.

18:28.873 --> 18:30.749
Please, let me out of here!

18:34.002 --> 18:35.252
There's something here!

18:35.419 --> 18:37.838
There's something here with me! Please let me out!

18:37.963 --> 18:39.340
It's not funny!

18:41.883 --> 18:43.551
My God!

18:45.177 --> 18:47.094
You should see your face!

18:47.845 --> 18:50.681
- What? - This goes straight to my website.

18:51.223 --> 18:53.767
- Was you? - It was perfect.

19:05.317 --> 19:08.194
Wow, you know what? Good for you, I saw it coming ...

19:08.653 --> 19:09.946
but I did not believe it.

19:15.784 --> 19:16.868
You forgive me?

19:16.910 --> 19:17.911
Go to hell

19:17.911 --> 19:19.370
That's not very Christian.

19:19.370 --> 19:21.330
I am old school. I don't turn the other cheek

19:21.330 --> 19:22.706
You are an old-school psycho.

19:22.706 --> 19:25.166
Hey! Stop that! Sara, stop it!

19:25.166 --> 19:26.417
No. No!

19:26.417 --> 19:27.877
She attacked me!

19:30.211 --> 19:31.712
You know, you have no sense of humor.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.130
- He locked me in the freezer. - What?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.466
- It was a joke! - That's not funny!

19:35.466 --> 19:36.966
You're an asshole, Joey.

19:36.966 --> 19:39.010
You peel back a Christian, you always get a little crazy.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.136
No. You need to apologize now, Joey.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.889
I'm sorry

19:44.473 --> 19:46.599
I'm sorry you lost your sense of humor.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.559
What is your problem?

19:52.353 --> 19:53.396
You, Eva.

19:54.188 --> 19:56.774
- Me? - You and your mystical bullshit.

19:57.024 --> 19:59.818
Sara and her crazy Christian cult

20:00.360 --> 20:01.695
You are my problems.

20:02.278 --> 20:04.154
Look, there is no God

20:04.363 --> 20:06.156
There is no afterlife

20:06.156 --> 20:08.074
There are no benevolent guiding spirits.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.243
This is the drug that bosses feed the masses ...

20:10.243 --> 20:12.787
to keep us confused and ignorant!

20:12.787 --> 20:15.914
To distract us from the fact that 1% of the population ...

20:15.914 --> 20:18.958
It is controlling 95% of the world's resources.

20:18.958 --> 20:20.375
Here we go again.

20:21.668 --> 20:25.504
Religion is the drug that ruined the world, no matter what.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.089
Christianity.

20:27.256 --> 20:30.341
Do you really think Jesus Christ is the only way to get to heaven?

20:30.341 --> 20:33.511
And the poor kid in the Amazon that's never
heard of Jesus Christ?

20:33.511 --> 20:37.347
Is he going to spend all  eternity burning in a firey pit of hell?

20:37.514 --> 20:39.141
Does that sound like justice to you?

20:39.141 --> 20:41.392
I don't  think so, and if ...

20:41.642 --> 20:44.562
if that's what God thinks justice is, then God's an asshole.

20:45.562 --> 20:47.271
That's enough, Joey.

20:48.313 --> 20:49.648
What about the Muslims, then?

20:49.857 --> 20:54.026
You blow yourself up. Kill a bunch of innocent men,
women and kids

20:54.026 --> 20:55.236
And then, guess what.

20:55.361 --> 20:59.865
He gets to spend all eternity with 72 horny virgins.

20:59.865 --> 21:02.033
Does that make sense to anybody, except a psycho?

21:02.033 --> 21:04.243
-You finished? - No, I'm not finished

21:04.702 --> 21:08.037
This is the only life we've got. It;s right here, right now.

21:09.037 --> 21:10.956
There is no heaven and no hell.

21:11.582 --> 21:13.917
People are asleep at the wheel, and I'm going
to wake them the fuck up

21:13.917 --> 21:17.378
It's a great speech, Joey, but you're wrong.

21:17.962 --> 21:20.088
There are spirits trapped in this world.

21:20.088 --> 21:22.591
Even you can not be arrogant enough to believe that ...

21:22.591 --> 21:24.301
humans are the center of the universe.

21:24.301 --> 21:27.178
No no no. Not humans, Me.

21:27.511 --> 21:29.597
I am the center of my universe.

21:29.597 --> 21:31.973
And I will prove to you ...

21:31.973 --> 21:36.476
That you and all your religious mumbo-jumbo is full of shit

21:36.476 --> 21:38.895
- We will see. - Yeah, we will

21:42.521 --> 21:44.106
You know what? I do not want to talk about it.

21:50.361 --> 21:53.238
Hey, it's okay, it is over.

21:54.448 --> 21:56.783
Joey knows exactly how to piss me off

21:56.783 --> 21:58.118
I feel like an idiot.

21:58.118 --> 22:01.037
Joey can be an asshole. You know it.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.205
Come on, ignore it. That's what I do.

22:04.998 --> 22:07.918
To be honest, this whole seance thing is really freaking me out

22:08.501 --> 22:10.002
It's no big deal

22:10.377 --> 22:13.547
It's like picking up the phone and calling grandma

22:13.881 --> 22:16.925
The only difference is ... she's passed on.

22:20.218 --> 22:22.887
The Bible warns us not to commune with the spirits.

22:23.763 --> 22:26.014
It also warns you not to eat shellfish

22:27.933 --> 22:28.934
Come On.

22:28.934 --> 22:30.935
I will not let anything bad happen to you.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.561
I promise.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.606
Let's get this over with.

22:49.032 --> 22:51.910
Sara, Joey would like to tell you something.

22:52.910 --> 22:54.285
Isn't that right, Joey?

22:58.581 --> 23:01.124
Sara, I'm sorry about the freezer.

23:01.124 --> 23:02.584
I did not mean to scare you.

23:04.086 --> 23:07.713
OK, I did mean to scare you, but I didn't mean to freak you out.

23:08.798 --> 23:09.839
Don't worry about it

23:11.216 --> 23:13.718
Would it help if I gave you free tickets to my next show?

23:16.512 --> 23:18.806
- Not really- Hey guys, my mikes are a little...

23:18.806 --> 23:21.307
"prosumer-ingus", so keep your voices up, alright?

23:21.307 --> 23:22.767
English, Marcus, we speak English here.

23:22.767 --> 23:24.894
Don't touch the rum.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.478
It is for the spirits.

23:28.854 --> 23:31.232
When are you going to put on your sexy voodoo robe?

23:32.065 --> 23:34.442
Santeria is not voodoo, retard.

23:34.484 --> 23:36.236
Whatever. Are you going to get naked?

23:36.236 --> 23:37.820
This is serious, Joey.

23:38.779 --> 23:40.280
I'm all business, baby

23:40.864 --> 23:42.199
What do we do next

23:42.740 --> 23:46.536
Okay, before we get started, I need to lay out
some ground rules.

23:47.036 --> 23:48.954
You do not need to believe in spirits ...

23:48.954 --> 23:51.206
but I need you to be open to the possibility.

23:51.206 --> 23:53.249
You have to set aside your prejudices.

23:53.249 --> 23:56.001
Even you, Joey, otherwise we will not see anything.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.795
Oh, your getting your excuses out early. I like that.

23:59.795 --> 24:01.046
Are you finished?

24:01.713 --> 24:04.841
OK, I promise. I promise that I will take seriously.

24:06.134 --> 24:07.051
Good.

24:07.468 --> 24:10.137
Iastly: Once we open the door to the spirit world ...

24:10.137 --> 24:13.432
we can not break the circle until the door is closed.

24:13.723 --> 24:14.724
OK?

24:20.645 --> 24:22.980
Marcus, I think we're ready.

24:43.955 --> 24:48.833
Guardians of the East, I call upon you to watch over our rights.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.335
Powers of knowledge and wisdom, guided by air ...

24:51.419 --> 24:54.963
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

24:55.423 --> 25:00.342
Guardians of the South, I call upon you to watch
over our rights.

25:00.634 --> 25:03.888
Powers of energy and will guided by fire ...

25:04.138 --> 25:07.849
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

25:10.434 --> 25:15.438
Guardians of the West, I call upon you to watch over our rights.

25:15.937 --> 25:19.107
Powers of passion and emotion, guided by water ...

25:19.274 --> 25:22.776
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

25:25.362 --> 25:29.616
Guardians of the North, I call upon you to
watch over our rights.

25:29.866 --> 25:33.868
Powers of endurance and strength, guided by earth ...

25:34.035 --> 25:37.705
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.541
Let all those who enter the circle ...

25:41.541 --> 25:45.586
do so in perfect love ... and perfect trust.

26:03.892 --> 26:05.893
Close your eyes and bow your heads

26:07.895 --> 26:09.647
Beloved Grandmother Maria ...

26:10.064 --> 26:12.857
we bring you gifts from life into death.

26:13.149 --> 26:16.818
Commune with us, Grandma, and move among us.

26:23.824 --> 26:25.660
Beloved Grandmother Maria ...

26:25.743 --> 26:28.411
we bring you gifts from life into death.

26:28.620 --> 26:32.497
Commune with us, Grandma, and move among us.

26:36.541 --> 26:37.876
There's something wrong.

26:40.378 --> 26:41.337
What?

26:43.172 --> 26:44.381
I can't do this.

26:44.422 --> 26:47.217
You can not make the fucking magic happen in a morgue?
Come on

26:47.300 --> 26:49.510
There's has a power here, a darkness.

26:49.510 --> 26:50.636
How do you spell bullshit?

26:50.636 --> 26:51.929
You're just trying to get out of our bet.

26:51.929 --> 26:53.138
That's not it.

26:53.138 --> 26:55.473
We are surrounded by bodies, the whole building ...

26:55.473 --> 26:56.724
and you can not make your magic happen.

26:56.724 --> 26:59.309
- Just admit thatyour full of shit. - Joey!

26:59.309 --> 27:02.687
I usually get images in my head before my grandmother
comes to me

27:02.687 --> 27:06.022
Faces or names. This is just dark.
All I see is darkness

27:06.189 --> 27:07.440
That's fine

27:07.565 --> 27:09.484
Just admit that you can't see through the dark mist ...

27:09.484 --> 27:10.652
and let's go.

27:11.069 --> 27:11.985
What?

27:13.529 --> 27:14.905
- Nothing. - What did you say?

27:14.905 --> 27:17.532
- Nothing. - I never said "dark mist".

27:18.032 --> 27:19.617
Oh my God. You can see it too.

27:19.617 --> 27:21.536
Stop it!  - That's why you're so afraid.

27:21.701 --> 27:23.120
Of course, I should have known.

27:23.203 --> 27:24.955
It's so obvious.

27:25.455 --> 27:26.748
You are a chaneller

27:26.997 --> 27:30.000
You see spirits, right? Hear Voices?

27:30.292 --> 27:31.627
- Fuck you! - No - Don't, don't

27:31.627 --> 27:32.752
Don't break the circle, Joey.

27:32.752 --> 27:36.922
I think the darkness is drawn to your negative energy.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.173
All your anger is acting as a beacon.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.426
- We ned to close the door. - Whatever.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.760
If you can't call up the dead, I win the bet.

27:43.885 --> 27:45.595
I'm headlining the club this weekend.

27:45.595 --> 27:46.847
Don't forget to to bring  your bikini.

27:47.305 --> 27:48.265
No!

27:52.142 --> 27:53.393
My God!

27:54.853 --> 27:56.854
- Shit! Eva.
- Eva!

27:56.979 --> 27:58.230
Eva! Can you hear me?

27:59.481 --> 28:00.399
Eva.... Eva

28:09.322 --> 28:10.824
Up, up.

28:13.033 --> 28:15.035
I told you not break the circle.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.495
You're bleeding.

28:19.371 --> 28:20.372
Are you OK?

28:21.707 --> 28:22.999
I think so.

28:24.584 --> 28:26.169
You're the one I'm worried about.

28:26.711 --> 28:27.795
What you mean?

28:28.295 --> 28:30.589
Joey, can't hide from the truth.

28:30.964 --> 28:32.924
We need to talk about what happened.

28:35.176 --> 28:36.427
I'll tell you what happened.

28:37.469 --> 28:39.804
You fell down and you passed out. I do it every weekend.

28:40.722 --> 28:42.182
This does not change anything!

28:49.562 --> 28:50.604
Are you OK?

29:01.613 --> 29:02.739
Joey.

29:03.990 --> 29:05.033
Joey!

29:06.033 --> 29:08.327
What the fuck... Joey!

29:27.175 --> 29:28.550
What the fuck

29:30.719 --> 29:31.637
Joey!

29:32.888 --> 29:34.013
Joey.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.059
Dude, do you see dead people?

29:39.392 --> 29:40.352
Joey.

29:48.524 --> 29:50.567
Dude, that is some nasty shit

29:52.611 --> 29:54.112
I did the joints in embalming fluid.

29:55.112 --> 29:57.572
- Maybe that has something to do with it. - You did what?

29:58.573 --> 30:00.617
You say the gang kids do it all the time.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.826
I told you it causes brain damage, you moron.

30:02.826 --> 30:04.244
What the fuck are you doing?

30:04.244 --> 30:05.245
Nothing.

30:05.245 --> 30:07.664
- Jesus you've got blood running  down... - I said it's nothing.

30:09.749 --> 30:12.376
Jesus man, I knew you'd cut up when we were kids, but ...

30:12.376 --> 30:13.794
Shut up!

30:14.044 --> 30:16.046
I do not want to talk about it.

30:17.797 --> 30:19.590
When did you start cutting again, man?

30:23.468 --> 30:25.387
This is the first time since my parents ...

30:26.387 --> 30:27.846
What? When they sent you to rehab?

30:31.933 --> 30:34.309
It wasn't a rehab clinic, Marcus.

30:35.143 --> 30:36.103
What do you mean?

30:36.478 --> 30:37.437
It was...

30:37.896 --> 30:39.438
They sent me to a nut-house.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.065
What?

30:42.191 --> 30:43.651
It was a fucking loony bin.

30:45.318 --> 30:46.903
Look, the doctors, they ...

30:48.238 --> 30:50.781
They filled me with all this antipsychotic medicine...

30:52.783 --> 30:54.493
until I couldn't hear them any more.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.116
Hear who?

30:59.702 --> 31:01.578
The voices that are in my head.

31:04.331 --> 31:05.999
- Why didn't you tell me this? - Because I didn't want you to think ...

31:05.999 --> 31:07.958
- I'm a freak. - I wouldn't think you're a freak, man.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.668
I am cured okay? I am cured.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.545
It was a miracle of modern medicine.

31:11.545 --> 31:14.005
Sure, the drugs... they worked. Okay?

31:14.172 --> 31:17.133
I haven't seen or heard shit since.

31:19.259 --> 31:23.763
I told myself that I imagined the whole thing, you know?

31:27.724 --> 31:29.141
I thought I was cured.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.156
Are you OK?

31:48.532 --> 31:49.491
I felt it

31:50.200 --> 31:53.410
Like something cold was trying to crawl inside me

31:54.328 --> 31:55.412
It's over now.

31:55.829 --> 31:56.913
We should go.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.040
No. You don't understand.

31:59.958 --> 32:02.501
Joey left the door open.

32:02.918 --> 32:06.421
He is a natural channel, but he has no control, no training.

32:07.129 --> 32:08.714
We have to close the door.

32:12.259 --> 32:16.178
I've never judged what you do, Eve, but this is scaring me.

32:17.137 --> 32:18.429
Maybe it's wrong.

32:27.688 --> 32:28.647
What?

32:29.188 --> 32:31.983
Are you going to put down that joint so we can
talk about what happened?

32:34.943 --> 32:37.319
-I don't think so. - Joey, you need to talk to me ...

32:37.319 --> 32:38.570
about your gift.

32:39.113 --> 32:40.571
It is ready to go again?

32:40.738 --> 32:43.032
Or are you going to admit to everybody that you're a fake
so we can get out of here?

32:43.032 --> 32:44.701
I'm not faking it, Joey.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.076
You know the gift is real.

32:46.076 --> 32:48.620
You know it, because you've got the gift too

32:48.620 --> 32:50.289
I'm not a freak, alright?

32:50.289 --> 32:51.914
"A freak"? Is that what you think I?

32:51.914 --> 32:53.416
Do not put words in my mouth, Eva.

32:53.416 --> 32:55.584
- It is OK to be scared. - I'm not fucking scared!

32:55.584 --> 32:58.211
Yes you are. You are terrified. But that's OK

32:59.211 --> 33:01.547
- I can help you. - I do not want your help.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.673
You can't just run away from this Joey

33:03.673 --> 33:05.216
You need to talk to me.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.302
You know what your problem is, Eve?

33:07.302 --> 33:08.927
You do not know when shut your Goddamn mouth.

33:08.927 --> 33:10.929
- Joey. - Do you know why they burn witches?

33:10.929 --> 33:13.014
It was the only way to make them shut up.

33:13.014 --> 33:16.267
They drowned them too. That's how my grandmother died.

33:16.267 --> 33:19.561
Killed by a bunch of ignorant ass-holes, just like you.

33:19.561 --> 33:21.896
I should have known it ran in the family. Do you know what?

33:23.147 --> 33:25.982
There's only one letter between witch and bitch.
And you're both, girl

33:25.982 --> 33:27.692
- Joey, stop it! - It's fine.

33:27.984 --> 33:29.068
I've got this.

33:30.527 --> 33:32.487
- Okay. - Want a personal experience?

33:32.487 --> 33:34.239
You want real proof?

33:34.947 --> 33:38.034
- I'll give you proof. - Wait, you think that's a good idea?

33:38.200 --> 33:42.579
I'll be fine, as long as no one breaks the connection.

33:43.871 --> 33:45.622
Joey, you do not have to do this, man.

33:46.789 --> 33:47.832
Bring it!

33:48.041 --> 33:49.625
- Joey, this is not a good idea. - Sit down!

33:49.625 --> 33:52.294
Let's go, Right now! I'm going to win your award, Marcus.

33:52.836 --> 33:54.713
Fuck it. We're rolling

34:06.264 --> 34:08.223
Close your eyes and bow your heads.

34:11.226 --> 34:14.353
Spirit, we bring you gifts of life into death.

34:14.437 --> 34:16.981
Commune with us and move among us.

34:20.608 --> 34:21.609
Hello.

34:23.735 --> 34:24.860
Cheap trick!

34:25.737 --> 34:29.531
We humbly thank you for this evening's visitation.
all seek your guidance

34:30.072 --> 34:31.909
- What is happening? - Do not break the circle.

34:32.034 --> 34:33.368
That does not prove anything!

34:33.786 --> 34:34.911
What's your name?

34:37.370 --> 34:41.540
I - A - M - U

34:42.665 --> 34:43.666
N

34:43.958 --> 34:45.043
C

34:45.126 --> 34:46.168
L

34:46.252 --> 34:47.920
E

34:48.103 --> 34:49.146
A

34:51.023 --> 34:52.024
N

34:52.899 --> 34:54.150
"I am unclean."

34:54.150 --> 34:55.860
Lord, protect us. Lord, protect us.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.195
Why are you here?

34:57.778 --> 34:58.779
J

34:59.655 --> 35:00.697
O

35:01.407 --> 35:02.449
E

35:04.492 --> 35:05.451
Y

35:05.993 --> 35:07.412
My God!

35:09.788 --> 35:11.289
What do you want to do , Joey?

35:13.666 --> 35:14.959
I want to hear it speak

35:16.709 --> 35:18.878
- Eva, make it stop! - Joey, call it off!

35:20.671 --> 35:22.506
Joey, let me know when you've seen enough.

35:22.756 --> 35:24.633
- Joey!
- Stop it, Joey!

35:24.633 --> 35:25.633
Joey!

35:32.430 --> 35:33.515
Joey?

35:33.516 --> 35:41.024
[speaks foreign language]

35:47.625 --> 35:49.169
Joey, what the fuck, man?

36:08.170 --> 36:38.546
[speaks foreign language]

36:46.547 --> 36:47.632
Stop!       Joey!

36:51.800 --> 36:54.178
Joey, get off me!

37:35.960 --> 37:37.210
Where were we?

37:43.215 --> 37:44.967
Come on. Go, Go, Go

37:47.635 --> 37:50.012
- What was that? - We gotta get out of here!

37:58.394 --> 38:00.019
- Is not working! - Do it again!

38:02.105 --> 38:03.231
It is broken!

38:04.022 --> 38:05.315
Come On. Come On!

38:15.073 --> 38:16.574
No no. Do Not!

38:18.326 --> 38:19.369
It is not working.

38:21.286 --> 38:22.871
It is not working.

38:24.372 --> 38:26.623
My phone's dead. Shit!

38:27.416 --> 38:28.375
Sara.

38:30.210 --> 38:31.877
- Wer'e trapped! - Sara.

38:32.211 --> 38:33.796
Sara, stop it!

38:34.964 --> 38:37.674
You said it was safe, Eva. That no one would get hurt!

38:37.674 --> 38:39.217
I know. But when Joey touched the eye ...

38:39.217 --> 38:40.677
Marcus is dead!

38:40.677 --> 38:42.219
He's dead and he's never coming back.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.721
No! Fuck!

38:45.888 --> 38:47.140
What happened to Joey?

38:47.140 --> 38:48.932
I do not know.

38:49.099 --> 38:51.768
But, somehow, we ihave summoned a malicious spirit.

38:51.768 --> 38:53.352
A malicious spirit.

38:55.479 --> 38:56.981
You mean a demon.

38:59.149 --> 39:02.736
Look, whatever it is, it's powerful.

39:02.736 --> 39:05.821
It's possessed Joey and trapped us in the building.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.364
We have to find out what it wants.

39:09.407 --> 39:10.741
You want to talk to it?

39:10.741 --> 39:13.160
We have to help Io to pass to the next dimension.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.828
You're crazy, you know? You lost your mind!

39:15.828 --> 39:18.164
It is the only way to save Joey.

39:18.164 --> 39:20.124
Joey 's gone, Eva.

39:20.166 --> 39:23.293
That thing, that monster down there killed Marcus ...

39:23.293 --> 39:25.170
and you want to go back there and talk to it?

39:25.836 --> 39:27.671
I'm sorry, but I will not. I can not.

39:27.671 --> 39:29.465
We have no choice.

39:29.965 --> 39:31.215
When I knocked Joey unconscious ...

39:31.215 --> 39:33.217
I trapped the spirit inside his body.

39:34.384 --> 39:38.554
He's going to come around/ and when he does
it is not going to be prety

39:39.680 --> 39:40.931
Please, Sara.

39:41.515 --> 39:42.891
I need your help.

42:08.713 --> 42:09.755
Fuck!

42:12.799 --> 42:13.800
Hey!

42:17.094 --> 42:18.095
Marcus!

42:23.015 --> 42:25.268
Marcus, get me out of here!

42:33.440 --> 42:34.858
What the fuck, Guys?

42:36.317 --> 42:37.943
Why am I on the ground, Eva?

42:38.193 --> 42:40.904
Joey, is that you?

42:41.113 --> 42:42.865
No, it's the Easter Bunny!

42:43.290 --> 42:44.415
Help me up.

42:45.791 --> 42:47.960
- Are you going to untie me or what? - We can't.

42:48.085 --> 42:49.210
Not yet.

42:51.087 --> 42:52.589
- What do you mean you can't? - We have to make sure ...

42:52.589 --> 42:53.965
that you're not going to attack us again.

42:53.965 --> 42:54.965
What?

42:55.174 --> 42:56.300
Where's Marcus?

42:56.300 --> 42:58.886
- You don't remember? - Remember what?

42:59.635 --> 43:02.180
Marcus get in here, I'm going to kick your ass!

43:03.555 --> 43:06.265
- It sounds like Joey. - Of course it sounds like Joey!

43:06.265 --> 43:07.808
I'm sitting here on the floor aren't I?

43:07.808 --> 43:10.060
It's me. Joey Polito

43:10.060 --> 43:12.187
The spirit can still be hiding inside.

43:12.479 --> 43:13.563
Spirit?

43:14.105 --> 43:15.523
Okay, let's go back

43:15.523 --> 43:17.775
Does somebody want to tell me what's going on?

43:26.448 --> 43:28.783
What's the Iast thing you remember, Joey?

43:32.536 --> 43:35.246
I do not know. Look, my head's killing me right now, alright?

43:35.246 --> 43:37.290
Answer the damn question, Joey.

43:43.044 --> 43:45.587
We were using the spiritual board ...

43:48.006 --> 43:50.132
and Eve did some trick with the eye.

43:50.758 --> 43:53.302
I do not know, it all goes blurry, I don't know

43:53.844 --> 43:56.471
You do not remember because you were possessed, Joey.

43:57.180 --> 43:59.140
What the hell are you talking about?

43:59.557 --> 44:02.226
You were possessed by an evil spirit.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.519
A demon.

44:04.061 --> 44:05.020
A demon?

44:10.566 --> 44:13.527
Do you guys have any idea how crazy you sound?

44:14.527 --> 44:17.904
I need to talk to the spirit inside your head, Joey.

44:18.071 --> 44:19.864
You have to let me hypnotise you

44:19.864 --> 44:22.075
So I can bark like a dog every single time you whistle?

44:22.075 --> 44:23.325
I don't think so

44:23.325 --> 44:24.785
You have to let her do it.

44:24.952 --> 44:26.078
Where's Marcus?

44:26.078 --> 44:28.871
Hypnosis does not work unless you give permission.

44:29.455 --> 44:31.999
Pleae, Joey. We do not know what else to do.

44:32.999 --> 44:34.708
You have to let Eva hynotise you.

44:34.708 --> 44:36.794
Fuck! Where's Marcus?

44:39.087 --> 44:40.421
He is dead.

44:42.173 --> 44:43.174
What?

44:45.842 --> 44:48.345
Okay, okay, this is a joke, right?

44:48.345 --> 44:50.054
That's joke. You guys are all in on a joke, right

44:50.054 --> 44:51.013
You got me.

44:51.013 --> 44:54.267
I get it. You're all going to teach me a lesson for all the bullshit that...
Okay, fine

44:54.267 --> 44:55.600
I've learned my lesson. Okay?

44:55.600 --> 44:57.185
Untie me now. Enough is enough.

44:57.185 --> 44:58.937
This isn't a joke, Joey.

44:59.937 --> 45:00.980
Bullshit!

45:01.688 --> 45:02.981
Where's Marcus?

45:03.189 --> 45:04.190
Marcus?

45:05.316 --> 45:06.400
Marcus?

45:08.568 --> 45:09.861
Where is he, dammit?

45:27.001 --> 45:28.710
What the hell is going on, Sara?

45:41.720 --> 45:42.804
Sara, come on

45:43.972 --> 45:45.389
Come on. Untie me, please.

45:45.973 --> 45:46.974
Please.

45:47.974 --> 45:49.434
Stay away from me.

45:53.937 --> 45:54.896
What is that?

45:59.817 --> 46:00.900
Marcus?

46:01.276 --> 46:04.612
My God, Marcus. What is this? What happened?

46:04.612 --> 46:07.156
- You attacked us. - Bullshit!

46:07.281 --> 46:09.616
Marcus tried to stop you and you broke his neck.

46:10.616 --> 46:14.369
Do Not! Marcus is my best friend! I would never do that!

46:14.369 --> 46:15.746
We saw you, Joey.

46:16.371 --> 46:18.539
We saw you break Marcus's neck

46:22.001 --> 46:23.918
We have no reason to lie to you.

46:25.003 --> 46:26.588
My God, You're serious

46:27.255 --> 46:28.464
You are serious?

46:28.464 --> 46:29.715
Joey...

46:30.257 --> 46:34.385
Look, I know you would never do anything to hurt us.

46:34.385 --> 46:35.887
But when you touched the eye of Isis ...

46:35.887 --> 46:38.014
you allowed the spirit to enter your body.

46:39.930 --> 46:42.057
So you're saying that this spirit or whatever ...

46:43.434 --> 46:44.727
It's inside of me?

46:46.728 --> 46:47.771
Yes

46:49.620 --> 46:50.912
Well then get it the fuck out of me

46:50.912 --> 46:53.289
Ok then you have to let me hypnotise you

46:53.289 --> 46:55.833
Yeah, whatever. Let's get it done.

46:56.166 --> 46:58.835
Okay ... good.

46:59.961 --> 47:01.921
But can't do it here. It's not safe.

47:05.508 --> 47:06.592
Come On.

47:20.769 --> 47:21.937
What are you doing?

47:22.729 --> 47:24.939
It is a bonding spell that my grandmother taught me.

47:27.817 --> 47:29.484
Is this really necessary?

47:29.859 --> 47:31.569
It's for our protection.

47:32.278 --> 47:33.613
And yours.

47:35.572 --> 47:36.698
Okay.

47:41.576 --> 47:42.786
Are you ready?

47:44.037 --> 47:45.413
I want you to stare ...

47:45.871 --> 47:48.999
to this spot on my forehead, right here.

47:50.459 --> 47:52.710
The more you focus on this spot ...

47:52.961 --> 47:55.630
the more you feel your body relaxing.

47:56.421 --> 47:58.549
You will notice that the sound of my voice ...

47:59.049 --> 48:01.592
becomes more relaxing.

48:08.181 --> 48:09.766
Now as you relax

48:10.183 --> 48:12.726
you are going to go even twice as deep.

48:14.936 --> 48:17.438
And you' are going to hear every word I say.

48:18.397 --> 48:20.941
Five, four ...

48:22.568 --> 48:25.570
three ... even deeper ...

48:26.779 --> 48:29.906
two ... and one.

48:35.119 --> 48:37.204
Now, you are completely asleep.

48:39.581 --> 48:40.998
Can you hear me, Joey?

48:44.668 --> 48:45.877
Tell me your name.

48:49.547 --> 48:51.423
Joseph James Polito.

48:52.382 --> 48:53.425
Good.

48:55.301 --> 48:59.095
Your soul is your spirit and your body is your vessel.

49:01.639 --> 49:04.182
Is there anyone else inside your body?

49:06.727 --> 49:07.768
Yes

49:10.061 --> 49:11.438
Do you know his name?

49:13.565 --> 49:15.024
No, he won't tell me.

49:15.941 --> 49:17.318
Is he your friend?

49:19.819 --> 49:20.778
No

49:21.029 --> 49:23.114
Do you want hime to leave your body?

49:26.033 --> 49:27.576
- Yes - Okay.

49:27.951 --> 49:28.994
It's okay.

49:30.328 --> 49:34.123
I'm talking now to the spirit entity inside Joey's body.

49:34.248 --> 49:35.957
You too are subject to my hypnosis ...

49:35.957 --> 49:38.168
so you must answer my questions.

49:41.378 --> 49:44.465
Can I talk to the spirit entity inside Joey's body?

49:46.966 --> 49:49.093
You can not hypnotize me, little girl.

49:53.221 --> 49:54.723
What's your name?

49:57.933 --> 50:02.145
Names have power, Eva Delgado ...

50:04.897 --> 50:06.732
you should know that.

50:08.690 --> 50:09.816
My God!

50:10.984 --> 50:13.403
And God will not help you, Sara.

50:14.362 --> 50:15.988
Not after what you did.

50:17.531 --> 50:18.865
What did you say?

50:20.992 --> 50:24.203
You were not always a good little girl.

50:24.536 --> 50:26.038
Were you Sara?

50:26.789 --> 50:28.832
We know your little secret.

50:29.041 --> 50:30.249
Do not listen to him, Sara.

50:30.249 --> 50:31.709
He's just messing with you.

50:32.001 --> 50:33.211
What do you want with Joey?

50:34.461 --> 50:35.920
I want his body.

50:36.295 --> 50:37.880
You are not welcome here.

50:38.339 --> 50:40.216
You must leave him.

50:42.175 --> 50:43.510
I think not.

50:44.344 --> 50:48.138
I've been looking for a suitable vessel ... ...

50:48.263 --> 50:50.015
for over two hundred years.

50:50.849 --> 50:54.644
This body is so strong and so young.

50:56.354 --> 50:58.814
I think I'll stay until he's all used up

51:00.147 --> 51:02.024
I will not allow that.

51:03.900 --> 51:05.443
You won't allow it?

51:09.780 --> 51:11.240
Who do you think You Are?

51:14.325 --> 51:15.868
How is my friend, Marcus?

51:16.285 --> 51:18.329
He is with Jesus, asshole.

51:18.703 --> 51:21.748
He's not with...Jesus.

51:22.874 --> 51:23.999
He is with us.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.127
I do not believe you.

51:28.253 --> 51:31.588
If Marcus is in hell, you should know everything about him
, right?

51:32.005 --> 51:33.132
Of course.

51:34.757 --> 51:36.175
What's his brother's name?

51:46.475 --> 51:48.518
Run! Get out of here now!

51:53.105 --> 51:54.106
Joey?

52:03.321 --> 52:04.573
He's still alive.

52:09.117 --> 52:10.201
Outside.

52:13.955 --> 52:15.163
Eve, where are you going?

52:15.873 --> 52:16.874
Eva?

52:17.791 --> 52:20.209
Joey tried to save us. You can't jst walk away.

52:20.209 --> 52:21.752
I am not trained for this.

52:22.211 --> 52:23.296
You better figure it out.

52:23.296 --> 52:25.839
I have no idea what I'm doing.

52:25.839 --> 52:28.216
I've never dealt with someone who was possessed.

52:28.758 --> 52:30.175
We need a priest.

52:30.509 --> 52:31.468
A priest?

52:31.886 --> 52:34.847
We can not leave the building, how do we find a priest?

52:35.847 --> 52:37.097
It's on you, Eva.

52:37.097 --> 52:40.058
You summoned that demon into Joey and
you've got to drive it out

52:41.268 --> 52:42.518
I can not.

52:42.518 --> 52:44.770
- I might make it worse. - How? How could it be worse?

52:44.770 --> 52:46.147
I might kill him!

52:46.522 --> 52:48.565
Joey is dying, Eva.

52:48.982 --> 52:50.108
He's dying.

52:50.108 --> 52:51.401
You have to try something.

52:54.236 --> 52:55.237
Please.

52:56.739 --> 52:57.905
Okay. Okay.

53:00.199 --> 53:03.869
There are specific prayers... incantations

53:03.994 --> 53:07.664
If I had a prayer book, I could try.

53:09.081 --> 53:10.041
Come On.

53:24.885 --> 53:26.218
What are we looking for?

53:28.804 --> 53:30.264
We need the King James Bible.

53:30.264 --> 53:32.182
Sara, I'm not Christian.

53:32.474 --> 53:34.893
When are you going to get it, Eva?

53:35.226 --> 53:37.394
This is not some damn poltergeist we're dealing with ...

53:37.394 --> 53:38.562
This is a demon.

53:38.812 --> 53:40.481
Okay, you summoned a demon.

53:41.647 --> 53:43.732
This is God versus the devil.

53:44.316 --> 53:47.277
Good versus evil. You cant mess around

53:47.818 --> 53:52.031
If you want Joey to survive this, you need the Bible.

53:55.450 --> 53:56.409
Okay.

54:08.544 --> 54:10.045
From what I remember ...

54:10.212 --> 54:12.255
we need to make the demon so uncomfortable ...

54:13.255 --> 54:15.256
that he choose to leave the physical flesh ...

54:15.256 --> 54:17.384
rather than stay and endure the pain.

54:19.010 --> 54:20.302
How do we do that?

54:21.261 --> 54:23.806
Prayers, a cross and holy water.

54:23.972 --> 54:25.265
Demons hate all three.

54:26.140 --> 54:27.183
Okay

54:27.975 --> 54:30.977
We have rosaries, we have prayer books.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.278
We've got holy water.

54:44.655 --> 54:46.323
We just need something to hold it.

54:48.908 --> 54:51.619
Ive got just the thing. Here.

55:01.168 --> 55:02.169
Okay ...

55:03.878 --> 55:05.170
that's everythingl.

55:06.630 --> 55:07.714
Are you ready?

55:09.258 --> 55:11.175
Yeah. You?

55:13.803 --> 55:15.470
What if we are not strong enough?

55:17.514 --> 55:18.974
Then we pray for help.

55:23.769 --> 55:24.812
Look at this:

55:27.689 --> 55:31.942
"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
the power of his might

55:33.110 --> 55:35.404
Put on the whole armor of God ...

55:36.571 --> 55:39.948
that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. "

55:41.074 --> 55:43.075
The armor of God.

55:45.536 --> 55:49.163
This is not a prayer, Eva, this is a call to battle.

55:50.331 --> 55:51.916
This is going to be a fight

55:52.458 --> 55:54.585
But it's a fight we can win

55:55.127 --> 55:57.629
if you put all your faith in God.

55:59.796 --> 56:04.383
Sara, my grandmother was killed by the Catholic Church.

56:06.093 --> 56:07.636
I'm doing my best here.

56:09.305 --> 56:11.347
I have something for you downstairs.

56:12.974 --> 56:14.142
Come on.

56:33.615 --> 56:34.991
There it is.

56:45.790 --> 56:47.459
Sara, that was your mother's.

56:47.959 --> 56:49.877
She would have wanted you to have it

57:00.802 --> 57:02.012
Thank You.

57:10.226 --> 57:11.435
That's weird.

57:25.279 --> 57:26.238
What is it?

57:26.864 --> 57:29.199
Holy water was right there.

57:43.418 --> 57:44.461
What 's wrong?

57:46.713 --> 57:47.839
Nothing.

58:13.125 --> 58:15.943
My God! My hand!

58:15.276 --> 58:16.568
My God!

58:18.070 --> 58:19.780
Let me look at it! Let me look at it! - No no!

58:20.739 --> 58:22.198
Eva, I'll have to pull it out.

58:22.198 --> 58:24.408
- No, please! - These scalpels are infected.

58:24.408 --> 58:26.119
We have to pull it out.

58:26.202 --> 58:27.702
- Okay. - On three.

58:28.870 --> 58:31.915
One two three.

58:39.462 --> 58:40.880
We have to stop the bleeding!

58:44.882 --> 58:46.092
Help me!

58:47.051 --> 58:49.511
There's no disinfectant! - My God!

58:51.513 --> 58:52.556
My God!

58:53.557 --> 58:56.892
My God, help me! Please!

58:57.059 --> 58:58.644
We ... We've got bleach.

58:58.769 --> 58:59.894
That will have to do

59:01.312 --> 59:02.272
Here.

59:18.742 --> 59:21.120
My God! The scalpel was disgusting.

59:21.287 --> 59:23.997
I can't even count how many infections I have.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.707
The bleach will take care of most of it.

59:26.708 --> 59:28.292
At least the bleeding stopped.

59:30.042 --> 59:31.210
Yeah

59:32.670 --> 59:33.837
How do you feel?

59:34.421 --> 59:35.505
Angry.

59:37.507 --> 59:38.549
Good.

59:45.013 --> 59:47.348
I think this verse has got your name all over it.

59:55.042 --> 59:58.628
Yea,  though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...

59:59.128 --> 01:00:02.548
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me ...

01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:05.259
Thy staff and Thy rod they comfort me.

01:00:06.217 --> 01:00:07.677
My favorite psalm.

01:00:07.677 --> 01:00:11.346
Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies ...

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:15.308
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:19.686
Your cup is empty, Eva.

01:00:19.686 --> 01:00:21.604
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me ...

01:00:21.604 --> 01:00:22.896
every days of my life ...

01:00:22.896 --> 01:00:26.108
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

01:00:26.108 --> 01:00:29.569
You have to believe for the words to have power, Eva.

01:00:29.652 --> 01:00:30.570
Burn it.

01:00:41.494 --> 01:00:45.289
Lord, stretch out your hand and look down on Joey.

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:46.665
Silence, witch.

01:00:46.873 --> 01:00:49.126
God will not listen to your words.

01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:50.710
You're not welcome here, demon!

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.087
It's time for you to move on!

01:00:53.087 --> 01:00:56.589
Do not presume to tell me what to do, child!

01:00:56.589 --> 01:01:00.634
I exorcise thee in the name of God, the Father Almighty ...

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:04.137
and in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord and judge.

01:01:04.137 --> 01:01:06.930
And in the power of the Holy Spirit ...

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.932
that thou depart from this creature of God ...

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.559
- Joseph Polito. - Amen!

01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:13.561
God will not forgive you for what you've done, Sara.

01:01:13.686 --> 01:01:15.855
You know I'm telling you the truth.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.188
Keep going

01:01:19.482 --> 01:01:22.110
We make this plea, devil, for your expulsion.

01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:24.945
We make this plea, devil, for your destruction

01:01:27.947 --> 01:01:31.533
You have no idea what you're doing, do you?

01:01:31.533 --> 01:01:35.870
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:36.829
Amen.

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:39.956
Your words have no power over me, Eva.

01:01:40.373 --> 01:01:43.043
I used to fuck your grandmother in hell.

01:01:45.753 --> 01:01:50.465
St. Michael the Archangel, we ask you to defend us
in this battle ...

01:01:50.465 --> 01:01:52.258
against this world of evil.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:56.636
The Holy Church venerates you as her true guardian
and protector.

01:01:57.636 --> 01:02:00.848
The Holy Church burns witches like you, Eva.

01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:02.807
Exodus 22:18..

01:02:02.807 --> 01:02:06.227
Thou shall not suffer a witch to live!

01:02:06.311 --> 01:02:09.897
Come back to us, Eve. You belong with us.

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:12.190
I'll make you a queen.

01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:15.818
I used to rule for a thousand years before the Christian God.

01:02:15.818 --> 01:02:20.280
And with you by my side, Eva, we will rule again.

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:23.865
Come back to me.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.994
I'd rather die.

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.913
Your might get your wish

01:02:34.207 --> 01:02:35.958
Eva, come on, this is not working.

01:02:36.584 --> 01:02:38.169
Don't leave, Eva.

01:02:38.377 --> 01:02:40.337
Don't leave, Eva.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.214
Come on, Eva.

01:02:44.965 --> 01:02:46.633
We have to try something else.

01:02:47.801 --> 01:02:48.885
Like what?

01:02:50.345 --> 01:02:52.054
Like the power of Christ.

01:02:53.472 --> 01:02:54.556
My God.

01:02:54.556 --> 01:02:55.682
Whats happening?

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.016
It's the demon!

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.728
Oh no! Eva, get the door!

01:03:00.728 --> 01:03:01.728
Okay.

01:03:06.607 --> 01:03:09.109
My God! Sara! Sara!

01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:32.877
My God!

01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:34.670
My God, Sara!

01:03:35.295 --> 01:03:36.421
Okay ...

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.173
You have to straighten the bone

01:03:38.173 --> 01:03:39.258
What?

01:03:39.258 --> 01:03:42.677
Take my foot, twist and pull it straight.

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:46.346
Sara, I don't know ... - Once it's straight ...

01:03:46.346 --> 01:03:48.056
wrap it tight, use the gauze.

01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:50.558
And find something to make a splint.

01:03:51.267 --> 01:03:52.643
Hurry

01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:54.144
Okay.

01:04:03.234 --> 01:04:04.860
- It will work. - Okay

01:04:06.028 --> 01:04:07.029
Okay

01:04:07.821 --> 01:04:08.863
Now what?

01:04:13.242 --> 01:04:14.243
Okay

01:04:14.535 --> 01:04:18.705
If I pass out you have to keep going until you
get the splint on, okay?

01:04:19.705 --> 01:04:20.664
Promise me?

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:22.874
I promise.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.292
Okay.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.044
Put your left hand under my heel.

01:04:27.503 --> 01:04:30.171
Take your foot with your right hand.

01:04:30.714 --> 01:04:33.174
You need to pull and twist, okay?

01:04:33.174 --> 01:04:34.175
Okay

01:04:34.925 --> 01:04:36.885
- Okay. - Are you ready?

01:04:37.136 --> 01:04:38.053
Do it!

01:04:48.102 --> 01:04:50.521
It's not working. - Use your hands. Use your hands!

01:04:50.938 --> 01:04:51.896
Okay

01:05:00.404 --> 01:05:01.572
- I can't do this!

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.698
I'm sorry!

01:05:03.906 --> 01:05:04.991
Use your belt.

01:05:06.409 --> 01:05:08.827
Wrap it around the bone and pull it tight.

01:05:08.827 --> 01:05:11.371
Okay. Okay.

01:05:12.413 --> 01:05:13.622
alright

01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:15.374
Okay

01:05:42.519 --> 01:05:43.604
Sara.

01:05:45.147 --> 01:05:46.731
Hey, welcome back.

01:05:48.357 --> 01:05:49.734
How are you doing?

01:05:54.988 --> 01:05:56.281
I've been better.

01:05:56.614 --> 01:05:57.615
Slowly.

01:06:08.956 --> 01:06:10.333
Nice splint

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:13.293
I found you a walking stick

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.754
Thanks.

01:06:29.932 --> 01:06:32.099
We're going to die, aren't we?

01:06:34.727 --> 01:06:35.727
No

01:06:37.646 --> 01:06:39.314
No, we're not

01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:44.193
Not if you accept the power of Christ to fight this thing.

01:06:44.485 --> 01:06:46.152
How do I do that?

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.448
Just open your heart and ask for forgiveness.

01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:54.076
God will do the rest.

01:06:55.868 --> 01:06:57.203
Sara...

01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:00.747
I rejected the Christian God my whole life.

01:07:02.998 --> 01:07:04.542
That does not matter.

01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:08.419
He has already forgiven you.

01:07:09.712 --> 01:07:11.381
All you have to do is ask.

01:07:14.967 --> 01:07:16.051
Okay

01:07:20.053 --> 01:07:21.346
Get the prayer book.

01:07:52.495 --> 01:07:53.997
Pray with me.

01:07:54.247 --> 01:07:55.164
Yeah

01:07:57.916 --> 01:07:59.334
I believe in God the Father ...

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:03.838
Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.

01:08:04.171 --> 01:08:07.425
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord ...

01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:10.218
which it was conceived by the Holy Spirit ...

01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:12.178
born of the Virgin Mary ...

01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:14.305
suffered under Pontius Pilate.

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:17.724
He was crucified, dead and buried ...

01:08:18.558 --> 01:08:20.100
He descended to the dead.

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:23.353
He rose again the third day ...

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:24.979
He ascended into heaven ...

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:28.316
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.

01:08:28.524 --> 01:08:31.401
Whence shall come to judge the living and the dead.

01:08:32.152 --> 01:08:35.946
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church ...

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:39.825
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins ...

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:43.786
the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.

01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:49.249
Amen.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:51.876
Amen.

01:09:12.057 --> 01:09:13.725
How is the foot, Sara?

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.728
Hey, I'm talking to you.

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.189
Open the prayer book.

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:25.649
Oh, you're going to ignore me now, is that it?

01:09:26.526 --> 01:09:30.447
In the name of Jesus Christ, we confidently undertake...

01:09:30.447 --> 01:09:33.741
to repuls the attacks and deceits of the devil.

01:09:37.075 --> 01:09:38.243
You're boring me.

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:41.830
May your mercy. Lord,  descend down upon us.

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:44.582
We five you from us ...

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:46.250
all unclean spirits ...

01:09:46.292 --> 01:09:48.877
all satanic powers, all infernal invaders ...

01:09:48.877 --> 01:09:50.504
all wicked legions.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.631
Jesus will not answer your prayers, Sara, you know that.

01:09:54.673 --> 01:09:57.051
Not after you have committed a mortal sin.

01:09:58.468 --> 01:09:59.719
What did you say?

01:09:59.719 --> 01:10:02.055
- Sara, keep reading. - Tell her, Sara.

01:10:03.222 --> 01:10:05.224
Tell her about little Jude.

01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:09.810
How do you know his name?

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:13.063
- Who is Jude? - Sar's bloody little bundle.

01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:15.689
What?

01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:19.151
Leave me alone!

01:10:19.151 --> 01:10:20.902
Sara, who is Jude?

01:10:23.321 --> 01:10:24.697
It's my baby!

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.157
That wasn't your fault.

01:10:27.241 --> 01:10:28.659
You had a miscarriage.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.452
Yeah, with a little help fom a coat hanger

01:10:32.786 --> 01:10:36.289
Sarah was six months pregnant, he was still alive when ...

01:10:36.289 --> 01:10:38.791
she squeezed him out, wasn't he?

01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:42.085
They took him from me. They wouldn't tell me if he
was alive or dead!

01:10:42.085 --> 01:10:44.128
You never told Joey, did you?

01:10:44.504 --> 01:10:47.339
Joey never knew that he was a  Daddy.

01:10:48.715 --> 01:10:50.676
Oh yes. That's right, Joey.

01:10:52.051 --> 01:10:53.593
Joey was the father

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.011
Sara?

01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:58.431
Joey was the father?

01:10:58.931 --> 01:11:00.641
It was after you broke up.

01:11:00.641 --> 01:11:03.227
It was a one-night stand. We were both wasted.

01:11:03.894 --> 01:11:06.604
I tried to tell him, but he did not want to be a father.

01:11:06.604 --> 01:11:08.940
How did you know, if you did not ask?

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.818
Where's Jude?

01:11:12.985 --> 01:11:14.944
Didn't baby Jesus tell you?

01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:19.114
Is he alive? Please, tell me.

01:11:20.824 --> 01:11:23.242
Why don't you ask baby Jesus?

01:11:23.993 --> 01:11:25.744
That's right, I forgot.

01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:28.663
He does not answer the prayers of the damned.

01:11:28.955 --> 01:11:31.165
No, He forgave me. I know he did.

01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:35.335
I don't think so, because there's some things
you can't be forgiven for ...

01:11:35.335 --> 01:11:38.129
and killing your baby is one of them.

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:40.381
No! I didn't know!

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.173
Baby Killer!

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.679
I told you it was just going to be you and me, Eva.

01:11:51.889 --> 01:11:53.224
Oh, Eva!

01:11:53.557 --> 01:11:55.183
Come back Eva!

01:12:18.697 --> 01:12:19.698
Sara.

01:12:20.661 --> 01:12:21.995
Sara, why didn't you tell me?

01:12:21.995 --> 01:12:23.413
You could have tallked to me.

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:30.711
I was so ashamed after what I did with Joey.

01:12:31.462 --> 01:12:32.670
After all ...

01:12:33.546 --> 01:12:35.173
I'm a bad person.

01:12:36.007 --> 01:12:37.383
I'm damned.

01:12:37.924 --> 01:12:39.301
I'm going to hell.

01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:40.927
No you are not.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.687
Jude?

01:13:08.616 --> 01:13:09.617
Sara.

01:13:49.857 --> 01:13:50.942
Jude?

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.785
Is that you, baby?

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:08.745
Mommy's got you.

01:14:09.246 --> 01:14:10.580
Mommy's got you now.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:12.206
It's you?

01:14:12.706 --> 01:14:13.916
baby Killer!

01:14:27.426 --> 01:14:28.844
I'm tired of this shit!

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:30.346
What? Where are you taking me?

01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:34.640
Jesus forced that legion of demons into a herd of pigs, right?

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.599
That's right.

01:14:35.599 --> 01:14:38.185
And then he drove the pigs off a cliff and drowned them

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:39.602
Yes. So what?

01:14:45.107 --> 01:14:47.442
We're going to send this mother-fucker back to hell.

01:15:03.413 --> 01:15:07.291
In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body.

01:15:12.586 --> 01:15:14.672
He has not suffered enough. yet

01:15:15.548 --> 01:15:16.673
Burn him.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:26.556
You have no power over me, mortal.

01:15:26.806 --> 01:15:27.848
Again.

01:15:31.184 --> 01:15:32.811
It is he who commands you.

01:15:32.977 --> 01:15:35.313
He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven ...

01:15:35.313 --> 01:15:36.814
to the depths of hell.

01:15:36.939 --> 01:15:38.565
It is he who commands you.

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:42.402
He who once stilled the sea, and the wind and the storm.

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.527
Again!

01:15:46.112 --> 01:15:47.780
- We need more holy water. - Keep praying!

01:15:48.489 --> 01:15:52.826
Tremble in fear, you enemy of the faith, 
you foe of the human race ...

01:15:52.826 --> 01:15:55.369
you begtter of death, you robber of life.

01:15:55.494 --> 01:15:58.998
Corrupter of justice, you root of all evil and vice.

01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:01.624
Seducer of men, betrayer of nations ...

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:04.044
instigator of envy, font of avarice ...

01:16:04.044 --> 01:16:07.379
formentor of discord, author of pain and sorrow.

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:11.299
Do not despise my command because you know 
me to be a great sinner.

01:16:11.507 --> 01:16:13.968
It is God himself who commands you.

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:17.220
I adjure you, ancient serpent ...

01:16:18.304 --> 01:16:20.389
By the judge of the living and the dead ...

01:16:20.389 --> 01:16:23.600
by your Creator, by the Creator of the whole universe ...

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.561
by he who has the power to consign you to the depths of hell ...

01:16:27.561 --> 01:16:30.064
Be gone from this temple of the Lord!

01:16:31.564 --> 01:16:32.899
Are you kidding?

01:16:33.107 --> 01:16:35.066
This is the best seat in the house.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.235
I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:40.446
Liar.

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.530
You are trapped.

01:16:42.406 --> 01:16:44.200
I bound you with my prayer.

01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:47.285
I'm not trapped

01:16:47.994 --> 01:16:50.204
I can leave anytime I want.

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:52.956
But where's the fun in that?

01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:57.501
You see, if I don't give you any hope, you are not 
going to struggle so much

01:16:57.709 --> 01:17:00.796
And I do love to see you struggle

01:17:02.004 --> 01:17:03.255
Prove it

01:17:15.808 --> 01:17:17.517
You couldn't stay away, could you?

01:17:18.059 --> 01:17:20.144
I command you in the name of ...

01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:22.187
Are you ready to die, little christian?

01:17:23.312 --> 01:17:24.438
Go to Hell

01:17:26.982 --> 01:17:29.359
If Jesus can turn water into wine ...

01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:31.444
imagine what I can do.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:56.505
You have no power over me, demon.

01:17:56.588 --> 01:17:58.465
Jesus protects those who love Him.

01:18:02.802 --> 01:18:03.761
Sara.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:07.471
Let's finish this.

01:18:08.639 --> 01:18:10.599
The power of Christ ...

01:18:21.066 --> 01:18:22.359
Help me!

01:18:45.167 --> 01:18:46.460
God.

01:18:47.795 --> 01:18:48.879
My God ...

01:18:53.466 --> 01:18:54.801
I'm dying, Eva.

01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:58.095
No! Please.

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.180
You have to let me go.

01:19:01.389 --> 01:19:03.265
I'm going to see my baby.

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:05.934
You're not going anywhere.

01:19:06.143 --> 01:19:07.143
Please.

01:19:07.268 --> 01:19:08.352
Stay with me.

01:19:08.686 --> 01:19:11.981
We will survive this, we'll be together.

01:19:12.564 --> 01:19:14.024
Promise me one thing.

01:19:16.693 --> 01:19:17.776
Anything.

01:19:18.986 --> 01:19:20.487
Save him for me.

01:19:29.368 --> 01:19:30.619
Sara.

01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:46.840
Eva.

01:19:48.967 --> 01:19:50.052
You know ...

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:54.263
I hate to be the kind of guy who says "I told you so."

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:58.016
But I did warn you that it would just come down
 to you and me

01:20:33.753 --> 01:20:36.338
Ready or not, Eva ...

01:20:37.631 --> 01:20:40.049
here I come.

01:20:43.968 --> 01:20:45.678
Please, Jesus, protect me.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:47.971
Protect me in my hour of need.

01:20:48.138 --> 01:20:49.097
Please.

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:53.768
He can't hear you!

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:59.147
But I can.

01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:07.195
Shall we say mass?

01:21:08.904 --> 01:21:09.905
Back off!

01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:14.325
What do you think I am, a vampire?

01:21:16.494 --> 01:21:17.828
I will kill you.

01:21:17.828 --> 01:21:20.497
Not before I shove that cross up your ass.

01:21:31.798 --> 01:21:32.799
Please.

01:21:34.216 --> 01:21:35.633
Please do not kill me.

01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:37.635
I'll do anything.

01:21:40.179 --> 01:21:41.429
Anything?

01:21:43.515 --> 01:21:46.600
It's been so long since I've had a willing mortal.

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:49.270
What?

01:21:51.104 --> 01:21:54.857
Let's start with a little kiss.

01:21:55.942 --> 01:21:56.984
A kiss?

01:21:57.401 --> 01:22:01.988
Don't worry, I won't melt your pretty little face, I promise.

01:22:05.657 --> 01:22:06.700
Okay

01:22:54.528 --> 01:22:56.447
You stupid fucking whore!

01:23:13.917 --> 01:23:15.544
I could make you a queen.

01:23:16.962 --> 01:23:18.714
I could have given the world!

01:23:20.131 --> 01:23:22.050
Now I'm going to rip off your head!

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.185
It is he who commands you.

01:23:35.185 --> 01:23:37.478
He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven ...

01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:38.771
to the depths of hell.

01:23:39.104 --> 01:23:41.314
The power of Christ compels you!

01:23:41.355 --> 01:23:43.816
Leave this body and go to the rat!

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:13.173
Joey.

01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:17.718
I'm sorry

01:24:50.909 --> 01:24:52.410
Go to hell.
