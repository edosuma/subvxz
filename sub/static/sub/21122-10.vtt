00:00.088 --> 00:01.585
Previously on "The Mist..."

00:01.651 --> 00:03.435
- No one could love you.
- Alex loves me.

00:03.482 --> 00:05.383
Until she finds someone that can fuck her.

00:06.982 --> 00:08.259
I did.

00:08.314 --> 00:10.911
What did you do? What did you do?

00:10.974 --> 00:12.983
Jay was gonna take her away from me.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.958
Everyone knows.

00:16.044 --> 00:19.552
- Knows what?
- That you were a slut.

00:19.615 --> 00:21.469
- Who's the father?
- I thought it didn't matter.

00:21.532 --> 00:22.929
We can't tell her it's not me.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.728
She adores you. It would break her heart.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.052
I didn't touch her that night.

00:26.107 --> 00:27.217
Just like your father.

00:27.271 --> 00:29.230
Always blaming others
for your own failures.

00:29.301 --> 00:30.693
He thinks I raped her, too.

00:30.756 --> 00:32.957
If this thing stops, will you go with me?

00:33.035 --> 00:34.042
I'll go with you.

00:36.812 --> 00:39.504
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?

00:39.559 --> 00:40.315
You know me?

00:40.382 --> 00:41.883
I'm just happy you're safe, sir.

00:43.719 --> 00:45.554
- I was with Kevin.
- Where is he?

00:45.620 --> 00:47.050
He's dead.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.025
You've been ready to
send people out for food

00:49.060 --> 00:50.065
when we have plenty.

00:50.112 --> 00:51.102
What do you think they're gonna say

00:51.137 --> 00:53.160
when they know you have your own supply?

00:53.195 --> 00:54.694
- Shelley's dead.
- What happened?

00:54.740 --> 00:56.817
- It was Alex.
- They're gonna come after her.

00:56.864 --> 00:57.798
Lock them up.

00:59.813 --> 01:01.282
Alex.

01:23.336 --> 01:24.537
Did you do this?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.876
I had to keep him away from you.

01:25.923 --> 01:27.421
You lied to me.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.701
You've lost your mind.

01:28.736 --> 01:29.826
- He's a psycho.
- Alex.

01:29.861 --> 01:31.218
Leave me alone!

01:31.291 --> 01:32.879
I have to protect you.

01:37.425 --> 01:39.794
Now more than ever.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.608
What happened?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.844
My dad's dead.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.555
It's okay.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.293
- No!
- Adrian, no!

02:04.340 --> 02:05.573
He saved my life.

02:05.608 --> 02:06.691
- He raped you.
- He didn't.

02:06.746 --> 02:08.352
- I believe him.
- Oh!

02:08.407 --> 02:09.638
He did.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.707
I have proof.

02:11.773 --> 02:13.575
What proof?

02:15.544 --> 02:18.914
We were at the hospital,

02:18.980 --> 02:21.247
your dad and me.

02:21.249 --> 02:23.585
We talked to the doctor.

02:23.652 --> 02:26.388
They got the results for the DNA test

02:26.455 --> 02:28.090
before the mist even came.

02:28.156 --> 02:30.436
- It was him!
- Oh!

02:33.762 --> 02:35.364
What?

03:06.962 --> 03:08.797
Did you find him?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.568
No.

03:13.635 --> 03:16.872
Did you see the other people?

03:16.938 --> 03:18.807
Let's go to them.

03:18.874 --> 03:21.810
I don't think they'll understand.

03:21.877 --> 03:24.479
They haven't seen what we've seen.

03:24.546 --> 03:27.094
Then they will have seen something else.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.317
They haven't seen you survive the mist.

03:31.019 --> 03:33.922
You're ashamed of what you're going to do.

03:35.653 --> 03:37.259
You should be proud.

03:41.029 --> 03:43.598
They don't know Jay,

03:43.665 --> 03:45.267
not like I do.

03:57.479 --> 03:59.147
Wait here.

04:01.817 --> 04:03.618
I'll find him.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.469
This is it.

04:20.535 --> 04:22.971
This is the last of the rations.

04:23.038 --> 04:25.941
- Keep your voice down.
- Why?

04:26.007 --> 04:27.598
You don't think they'll find out?

04:28.443 --> 04:31.780
After this, starvation.

04:31.847 --> 04:35.717
Or we start sending
people out on food runs.

04:35.784 --> 04:37.918
Chief?

04:37.996 --> 04:39.744
Chief Heisel?

04:44.259 --> 04:47.032
- How did you get here?
- Is help coming?

04:47.103 --> 04:49.831
Is it over? Are we safe?

04:49.898 --> 04:52.134
Are we?

04:59.274 --> 05:01.207
I'm sorry.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.544
It's just me.

05:02.611 --> 05:05.013
I was hoping my son would be here.

05:13.288 --> 05:16.358
Maybe we go to my office.

05:18.627 --> 05:20.696
It's been hard.

05:20.762 --> 05:23.229
Things haven't exactly been good here.

05:23.231 --> 05:25.005
Things haven't been good anywhere.

05:25.008 --> 05:25.769
You know me.

05:25.824 --> 05:29.237
You know I only try to do
what's best for everybody.

05:29.271 --> 05:31.273
I just want...

05:31.339 --> 05:34.710
I just want people to get along.

05:34.776 --> 05:36.378
You know that, right?

05:36.445 --> 05:39.247
Where is he?

05:42.417 --> 05:45.721
Eve Copeland locked him
up in a storage room.

05:45.787 --> 05:50.759
Then we locked Eve Copeland
and her daughter up with him.

05:50.826 --> 05:53.628
What? Why?

05:53.695 --> 05:57.866
As I said, it's been hard.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.802
The Copeland girl killed a woman.

06:00.869 --> 06:03.413
People want justice.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.706
I just want to help them.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.475
Justice?

06:06.541 --> 06:09.211
No, it... just...

06:09.277 --> 06:11.053
We just want to ask the Copelands

06:11.088 --> 06:14.750
to find another place to be
until this all blows over.

06:14.816 --> 06:18.220
You taking the law into
your own hands, huh?

06:22.224 --> 06:24.826
This is a private mall.

06:24.893 --> 06:28.397
It's not illegal to throw people out.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.503
You've got something there.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.143
When this whole thing is over,

06:41.243 --> 06:44.874
we'll all have done things
we won't be proud of.

06:44.968 --> 06:49.918
But for now, we just gotta get to the when.

06:52.988 --> 06:55.255
Give me my son

06:55.257 --> 06:58.827
and I won't interfere
with how you run your mall.

07:14.443 --> 07:17.647
I don't know what the
fuck we're waiting for.

07:17.686 --> 07:20.949
Can someone tell me what
the fuck we're waiting for?

07:50.379 --> 07:51.913
Aah!

07:51.980 --> 07:53.515
Kevin!

07:53.582 --> 07:57.552
Kevin, I thought you were...

07:57.619 --> 07:59.554
What the hell?

08:01.656 --> 08:04.273
Adrian said you got shot in the head.

08:04.312 --> 08:05.051
Where is he?

08:05.086 --> 08:07.705
He's, uh, he's looking for your family.

08:07.752 --> 08:09.248
- Shit.
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:09.283 --> 08:11.102
What's going on? What the fuck happened?

08:12.634 --> 08:14.202
Adrian raped my daughter.

08:14.236 --> 08:15.947
What?

08:15.982 --> 08:16.672
When I figured it out,

08:16.707 --> 08:18.845
he knocked me out and left me there.

08:18.908 --> 08:20.633
I've been looking everywhere.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.616
There's a big group down by the fountain,

08:21.651 --> 08:23.602
but no Eve and Alex.

08:23.657 --> 08:25.947
Yeah, I saw that group, too.
They look pretty unstable.

08:26.014 --> 08:28.517
There's nobody down there. I checked.

08:28.583 --> 08:29.551
Okay.

08:29.618 --> 08:30.719
Where's Bryan?

08:30.786 --> 08:31.990
His name is Jonah.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.159
It's... it's a long story.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.716
He left while I was asleep.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.506
He's probably looking for Adrian.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.629
We've gotta find them, both of them.

08:40.696 --> 08:43.916
Look, I'll take one
floor, you take the next.

08:43.984 --> 08:46.568
- Okay.
- We'll meet back in the middle.

08:46.635 --> 08:49.438
I'm glad you're here.

08:49.504 --> 08:51.039
Be careful.

08:53.508 --> 08:57.412
If we know each other,
then tell me who I am.

08:57.479 --> 08:59.182
I'm not the person you want to talk to.

08:59.237 --> 09:00.882
- We need to go.
- Go where?

09:00.949 --> 09:03.385
Arrowhead.

09:03.452 --> 09:05.185
No.

09:05.187 --> 09:07.759
We have to. I'm sorry. I'm
not gonna hurt you, sir.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.847
You just knocked me out.

09:09.901 --> 09:13.195
Dr. Bruin told us to be careful.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.330
She the woman who tortured me?

09:15.397 --> 09:18.300
She's the reason you're alive, sir.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.502
Why do you keep calling me sir?

09:24.539 --> 09:28.477
If I'm your superior, then release me.

09:31.013 --> 09:33.782
I order you to release me.

09:33.849 --> 09:36.251
- Sir.
- I order you, soldier.

09:55.037 --> 09:57.539
You're free, sir.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.451
Connor.

10:09.518 --> 10:12.354
Dad.

10:12.421 --> 10:13.488
Dad.

10:17.859 --> 10:19.394
Can you get up?

10:19.461 --> 10:21.530
Let's go.

10:21.596 --> 10:23.999
Be careful. Easy.

10:24.066 --> 10:26.676
- All right.
- You have to help us.

10:26.711 --> 10:27.903
They're gonna kill us.

10:27.969 --> 10:30.472
Come on.

10:30.539 --> 10:32.908
Connor?

10:32.974 --> 10:34.910
Connor?

10:41.983 --> 10:48.357
The boy can go, but you
two need to come with us.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.955
Where are we going?

10:56.795 --> 10:58.229
I found him.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.403
Mrs. Raven?

11:02.469 --> 11:05.673
He's so soft.

11:10.978 --> 11:13.948
Dad, we have to go back for Eve and Alex.

11:13.983 --> 11:16.570
- They're gonna kill them.
- He's so beautiful.

11:16.605 --> 11:18.786
Nature can be so cruel.

11:20.921 --> 11:23.624
Dad?

11:23.691 --> 11:26.193
We can't leave them behind.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.395
We have to.

11:28.462 --> 11:30.364
You'll understand.

11:30.431 --> 11:32.533
Understand what?

11:32.599 --> 11:34.902
Just trust me.

11:34.969 --> 11:36.737
Come, Benedict.

11:41.842 --> 11:43.978
Where are we going?

11:46.113 --> 11:47.581
It's okay, son.

11:47.648 --> 11:51.085
Everything is going to be okay now.

11:51.151 --> 11:52.619
Come.

12:05.032 --> 12:07.001
Do you know what's happening out there?

12:07.067 --> 12:09.136
It's the Black Spring.

12:09.203 --> 12:11.672
Black Spring? What's that?

12:11.739 --> 12:14.241
I'll show you.

12:14.308 --> 12:15.609
Show me what?

12:15.676 --> 12:17.287
How to survive it.

12:17.342 --> 12:19.728
We should go back, get Eve and Alex.

12:19.775 --> 12:22.883
Dad, we should help them.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.623
We can't.

12:24.701 --> 12:26.086
Why?

12:26.153 --> 12:27.988
We just can't.

12:28.055 --> 12:30.324
You're gonna have to trust me.

12:30.391 --> 12:33.594
Do you trust me?

12:35.663 --> 12:38.299
Yeah, of course.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.367
I love you.

12:40.434 --> 12:42.102
You know that?

12:44.605 --> 12:45.973
Yeah.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.275
And I am so proud of you.

12:48.342 --> 12:51.979
You are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

12:52.046 --> 12:54.114
Dad, what's going on?

12:54.181 --> 12:56.050
You need to come here now.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.319
You trust me, right?

13:03.125 --> 13:04.826
What are we doing?

13:08.462 --> 13:11.865
I, um, I can't explain it.

13:11.932 --> 13:14.234
It'll sound weird.

13:14.301 --> 13:17.071
You just have to trust me.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.173
You're very brave.

13:19.239 --> 13:21.208
Dad?

13:25.913 --> 13:28.148
I'm sorry.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.250
I am so sorry.

13:30.317 --> 13:32.553
I made you.

13:32.619 --> 13:35.316
What? What are you talking about?

13:35.379 --> 13:37.925
It's not your fault.

13:37.992 --> 13:40.094
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.762
What's she doing?

13:41.895 --> 13:44.164
No. Dad, no.

13:44.231 --> 13:48.669
No! No, Dad.

13:48.736 --> 13:50.537
Dad!

13:50.604 --> 13:52.206
Dad, let me in!

13:52.272 --> 13:57.244
Dad, what are you doing?

13:57.311 --> 13:59.377
I'm your son! What are you doing?

13:59.412 --> 14:00.614
Let me in!

14:01.649 --> 14:04.451
Dad!

14:35.349 --> 14:37.618
It's still there.

14:37.685 --> 14:39.453
It will disappear.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.423
He may still be alive.

14:42.489 --> 14:44.625
It may not have taken him yet.

14:44.692 --> 14:46.894
Come.

15:16.323 --> 15:19.960
Losing someone you love
can be so beautiful.

15:20.027 --> 15:21.862
You'll see.

15:31.872 --> 15:34.208
I'm proud of you.

15:34.274 --> 15:36.977
I'm so proud of you.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.883
It'll be over soon.

15:42.916 --> 15:46.520
It will all be over.

15:54.962 --> 15:56.951
- Why are you doing this?
- We have to.

15:56.986 --> 15:58.073
We're just making sure

15:58.136 --> 16:00.170
this is a safe space for everyone to be

16:00.205 --> 16:02.883
- while we wait this out.
- You're insane.

16:02.953 --> 16:04.663
We haven't hurt anyone.

16:04.718 --> 16:06.173
We kept to ourselves.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.891
- Tell that to Shelley.
- I didn't do anything.

16:08.954 --> 16:10.796
- I saw you.
- That's a lie.

16:10.859 --> 16:12.113
And how do we trust you?

16:12.175 --> 16:14.848
Shelley saw you making out with
the boy you accused of rape.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.818
- Maybe she didn't...
- What?

16:16.853 --> 16:18.062
Maybe she didn't what?

16:18.097 --> 16:19.353
Didn't mean it?

16:19.420 --> 16:23.622
Is that why you lied about
surviving in the mist?

16:23.692 --> 16:26.060
You know what? Maybe Shelley was right.

16:26.126 --> 16:29.632
Maybe you are a part of it.
That's why you killed her.

16:29.687 --> 16:30.722
We don't have to stand for this.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.561
- We're not your prisoners.
- Stop.

16:32.596 --> 16:35.269
I have fought too many assholes like you

16:35.336 --> 16:38.041
to give up that power freely. Come on.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.074
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh!

16:43.877 --> 16:46.947
We have the right to defend ourselves.

16:49.183 --> 16:51.552
Anybody else disagree?

16:53.287 --> 16:56.390
Yeah, I thought so.

17:34.862 --> 17:37.515
How could you do it?

17:37.577 --> 17:40.334
How could you do that to her?

17:40.401 --> 17:42.827
Uh! No!

17:42.862 --> 17:43.871
No!

17:49.351 --> 17:52.005
Get off me please, please,
please, please, please,

17:52.052 --> 17:53.653
please, please, please stop. Please.

17:53.692 --> 17:54.454
No.

17:55.716 --> 17:59.320
I know where they are.

17:59.386 --> 18:02.256
I know where they're keeping Eve and Alex.

18:06.593 --> 18:08.462
We need to go.

18:08.529 --> 18:10.527
I can't.

18:10.597 --> 18:12.032
Sir, we have to.

18:12.099 --> 18:15.035
- I can't leave my friends.
- What friends?

18:15.102 --> 18:18.172
The people I met who helped me get here.

18:18.238 --> 18:19.448
None of that matters now.

18:19.503 --> 18:20.874
It matters to me.

18:20.941 --> 18:23.490
These are people you've
known for five days.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.391
I've known you for eight years.

18:28.349 --> 18:30.184
You have no idea, do you?

18:30.250 --> 18:32.686
You have no idea who you are.

18:35.089 --> 18:37.746
Don't you want to know who you are?

18:37.824 --> 18:39.293
- Tell me.
- Come with me.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.894
- I need to bring them.
- You can't.

18:40.961 --> 18:42.563
They can never know. You understand?

18:42.630 --> 18:45.165
If you care for them, they can never know.

18:45.232 --> 18:47.534
Jonah?

18:47.601 --> 18:49.570
Where have you been?

18:49.637 --> 18:53.040
I, um...

18:53.107 --> 18:54.875
Who's this?

18:54.942 --> 18:57.177
I'm a friend of Jonah's.

19:05.653 --> 19:08.689
Kevin's, uh...

19:08.822 --> 19:10.524
Kevin's here.

19:10.591 --> 19:14.428
He's alive and he needs our help.

19:14.495 --> 19:16.336
Wow, um...

19:16.406 --> 19:18.065
Jonah.

19:18.132 --> 19:20.644
This guy can help me find out who I am.

19:22.136 --> 19:23.737
I need to go.

19:23.837 --> 19:25.324
Wait. Go where?

19:25.402 --> 19:27.839
I'm sorry.

19:27.841 --> 19:31.597
What do you mean? Jonah, go where?

19:31.632 --> 19:32.880
I have to go with him.

19:32.946 --> 19:35.616
What the fuck are you talking about?

19:35.683 --> 19:36.848
You have to go.

19:36.850 --> 19:38.523
Please.

19:39.853 --> 19:42.643
But we... Let's just help him.

19:42.678 --> 19:44.258
Then we can all go together.

19:44.325 --> 19:46.193
I'm afraid that's not possible.

19:46.260 --> 19:50.364
- I'll find you.
- Jonah, please.

19:50.431 --> 19:52.533
We have to go, sir.

19:52.599 --> 19:55.803
Please.

20:01.275 --> 20:04.078
Don't leave me.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.918
I'm sorry.

20:20.561 --> 20:23.130
She didn't do anything.

20:23.197 --> 20:24.996
Meaning you have?

20:25.031 --> 20:26.066
No.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.635
You killed her.

20:27.701 --> 20:29.057
Part of your rules as well?

20:29.092 --> 20:30.838
She was going to break the rules,

20:30.904 --> 20:32.382
and the rules are clear.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.174
Whoever endangers the group

20:34.241 --> 20:36.441
has to leave the mall.

20:36.476 --> 20:38.412
That means Alex must go.

20:38.479 --> 20:42.142
- She has to.
- I'm not letting you throw her out.

20:42.235 --> 20:44.104
Well, then you're leaving with her.

20:51.592 --> 20:54.400
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.

20:54.447 --> 20:56.031
No, please, Gus.

21:07.041 --> 21:08.976
Con-Connor.

21:09.043 --> 21:10.642
You have to help us. You have to stop this.

21:10.677 --> 21:12.313
No, Connor's staying out of this.

21:12.379 --> 21:13.806
I can throw out anybody I want.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.949
- Please, you have to.
- He doesn't have to do anything.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.117
Yes, he does.

21:17.184 --> 21:18.519
Connor?

21:26.060 --> 21:28.062
I'm so sorry.

21:28.128 --> 21:30.331
Please forgive me.

21:30.397 --> 21:32.066
For what?

21:37.237 --> 21:40.574
I was already pregnant when I met Kevin.

21:40.641 --> 21:44.350
He didn't want to know who it was.

21:44.385 --> 21:47.247
He thought it was better that way.

21:47.314 --> 21:49.631
I'm so sorry.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.185
What?

21:53.754 --> 21:57.591
There's a reason you couldn't be with Jay.

22:02.396 --> 22:04.565
You understand?

22:18.445 --> 22:21.076
After everything else they've lied about,

22:21.154 --> 22:23.287
you expect us to trust this?

22:24.326 --> 22:25.992
Connor?

22:27.721 --> 22:29.056
She's lying.

22:30.668 --> 22:32.620
Mrs. Carmody was right.

22:32.706 --> 22:34.542
These people will do anything.

22:34.596 --> 22:35.829
She's sick.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.531
You're a sick person.

22:37.598 --> 22:38.999
You would have said something before.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.868
You would have said something.

22:40.934 --> 22:42.769
Mom?

22:42.836 --> 22:45.372
You love Dad so much,

22:45.439 --> 22:47.439
we couldn't take it away from you.

22:47.502 --> 22:49.261
There's no place in
here for people like you.

22:49.331 --> 22:50.608
She always was a whore.

22:50.679 --> 22:51.785
The girl fucked her brother.

22:51.847 --> 22:53.909
- I didn't.
- Now he didn't do it?

22:53.979 --> 22:56.069
- Which is it?
- You disgust me.

22:56.132 --> 22:57.994
You're freaks, both of you.

22:58.049 --> 23:00.440
You've all lost your fucking mind.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.625
It's time.

23:06.193 --> 23:09.463
No.

23:09.530 --> 23:13.261
Connor, please. Please,
she's your daughter.

23:14.468 --> 23:16.056
Where are they?

23:16.119 --> 23:18.805
Let me go and I'll tell you.

23:18.872 --> 23:22.075
I don't even know if I'm
going to let you live.

23:22.142 --> 23:24.111
You wouldn't.

23:25.779 --> 23:30.317
Remember what I told
Nash in the psych ward?

23:30.417 --> 23:32.786
I want to see you suffer.

23:32.853 --> 23:35.622
Uh!

23:35.689 --> 23:37.624
And I want you to learn...

23:37.691 --> 23:39.726
Uh!

23:39.793 --> 23:42.345
That there will be no salvation.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.131
Uh!

23:45.966 --> 23:49.078
But if you tell me where my family is,

23:49.148 --> 23:51.505
then maybe, just maybe,

23:51.572 --> 23:53.900
I will stop before you die.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.029
I love her.

23:59.099 --> 24:01.248
Uh!

24:04.918 --> 24:06.787
Please stop.

24:06.854 --> 24:10.090
Last chance.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.526
Where's my family?

24:12.593 --> 24:13.861
They're gonna kill her.

24:13.927 --> 24:16.980
They're gonna throw her out of the mall.

24:17.035 --> 24:19.183
Eve, too.

24:19.253 --> 24:21.065
- You need to hurry.
- Kevin?

24:21.535 --> 24:23.403
Uh!

24:23.437 --> 24:27.046
Kevin? We need to go.

24:27.089 --> 24:27.840
Where's Jonah?

24:27.875 --> 24:29.038
- He left.
- What?

24:29.101 --> 24:31.547
With another soldier. He's gone.

24:31.582 --> 24:33.480
Let's just go.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.048
Not quite yet.

24:37.251 --> 24:39.152
Kevin, here!

24:39.219 --> 24:40.721
Come on.

24:40.787 --> 24:43.296
Adrian doesn't matter anymore.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.058
Come on. Let's go.

24:45.125 --> 24:47.427
Let's go!

24:47.461 --> 24:49.897
- Get off me.
- Come on.

24:49.963 --> 24:51.465
No!

24:51.532 --> 24:54.968
Please let us walk out together.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.871
Okay.

24:57.938 --> 24:59.973
Then get to walking then.

25:04.368 --> 25:06.304
Stop!

25:07.495 --> 25:08.630
Eve!

25:10.600 --> 25:11.685
Kevin?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.259
Dad?

25:23.997 --> 25:25.399
Are you okay?

25:31.438 --> 25:33.707
They want to kick us out.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.013
Aah!

25:58.932 --> 26:01.535
Get out. Now!

26:01.602 --> 26:03.637
- You're leaving, too.
- Don't do this!

26:03.672 --> 26:06.206
I am not gonna let this
place fall into chaos,

26:06.273 --> 26:07.982
and chaos is what you bring.

26:08.055 --> 26:10.544
Please. This is insane.

26:10.611 --> 26:11.990
You attacked us.

26:15.983 --> 26:19.453
Please.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.788
This is our one chance at safety.

26:21.855 --> 26:24.424
I know you.

26:24.491 --> 26:26.091
I know you.

26:26.146 --> 26:28.889
Please. Please!

26:31.164 --> 26:33.383
Just let my family stay.

26:33.430 --> 26:34.693
Family?

26:34.763 --> 26:36.770
What...

26:36.837 --> 26:39.664
Your wife screwed the chief.

26:39.719 --> 26:41.642
Your daughter isn't really yours.

26:41.708 --> 26:44.011
Not much of a family, huh?

26:46.547 --> 26:48.782
Bunch of bastards!

26:58.859 --> 27:01.295
Fuck you.

27:01.373 --> 27:02.441
Get out.

27:02.563 --> 27:05.699
Fuck all of you.

27:05.766 --> 27:07.201
Get the door.

27:08.869 --> 27:09.870
Move.

27:24.282 --> 27:26.184
Hurry up!

27:31.692 --> 27:33.894
Run.

27:37.311 --> 27:38.230
Follow me.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.667
Get the door! Get the door!

27:44.470 --> 27:46.325
- Stay with me.
- Where?

27:46.360 --> 27:48.338
We have a car. It's at
the back of the mall.

27:48.373 --> 27:49.811
- I can't see.
- Just run.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.444
Follow the wall down to the corner.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.024
Alex?

28:28.071 --> 28:29.506
Alex?

28:31.575 --> 28:33.577
Alex?

28:33.644 --> 28:35.913
Go find the truck and bring it here.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.288
She can't be gone.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.365
She can't just disappear. Alex? Alex?

28:46.400 --> 28:47.191
Alex?

28:59.770 --> 29:01.282
Alex?

29:01.355 --> 29:02.601
Alex?

29:09.313 --> 29:10.614
Hey.

29:13.550 --> 29:14.985
Alex?

29:15.052 --> 29:18.204
Let's go. Let's go.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.945
- Jay!
- Alex!

29:22.008 --> 29:24.261
No!

29:26.196 --> 29:27.099
- Get in the car.
- Alex!

29:27.145 --> 29:28.471
Let go! Jay!

29:28.510 --> 29:30.567
- Get in the car.
- Let go!

29:30.634 --> 29:31.769
- Alex, get in the car.
- Jay!

29:35.372 --> 29:37.198
- Get in the car.
- Get in the car.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.198
No!

29:38.261 --> 29:40.077
- Eve, get in the car.
- No!

29:48.227 --> 29:50.230
How far away is Arrowhead?

29:50.265 --> 29:51.730
It's two, three hours.

29:53.199 --> 29:55.835
You're doing the right thing, sir.

29:55.901 --> 29:59.238
Do you know what it is out there?

29:59.371 --> 30:01.740
Where it came from?

30:01.857 --> 30:04.927
Do I know?

30:05.019 --> 30:07.721
We should leave.

30:07.788 --> 30:10.124
The doctor will have answers for you.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.850
Jesus.

30:42.756 --> 30:44.792
He didn't do it.

30:48.729 --> 30:51.865
I want you to know that.

30:54.902 --> 30:56.770
Who was it then?

30:56.837 --> 31:00.441
Who told you I was dead?

31:07.915 --> 31:11.819
Let's go. I don't want to be here.

31:11.886 --> 31:13.988
I don't want to be near these people.

31:37.301 --> 31:39.236
It'll be gone soon.

31:39.303 --> 31:43.707
Once they are dead, it'll be gone.

31:45.075 --> 31:46.910
Why would it be gone?

31:46.977 --> 31:50.439
Because I...

31:50.517 --> 31:52.732
I am Nature's messenger.

31:52.767 --> 31:55.536
She chose me,

31:55.603 --> 31:58.806
first through the moth and then the spider.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.034
The Black Spring is here.

32:01.112 --> 32:03.482
She needed someone, someone who...

32:05.104 --> 32:06.390
She showed me...

32:06.425 --> 32:07.771
What did she say?

32:07.834 --> 32:10.076
...showed me what had to be done.

32:10.143 --> 32:12.768
A Forest Ranger I...

32:12.838 --> 32:16.048
A Forest Ranger I knew, he...

32:17.617 --> 32:19.051
He found a bear,

32:19.118 --> 32:22.889
a mother bear who had given birth.

32:22.955 --> 32:25.925
She'd given birth to three cubs.

32:28.127 --> 32:32.120
The rangers kept an eye on the cubs

32:32.206 --> 32:35.268
to make sure they wouldn't
be injured by other predators.

33:15.182 --> 33:16.149
What?

33:19.078 --> 33:20.413
Dad?

33:20.480 --> 33:22.381
What are you doing?

33:24.717 --> 33:27.253
Kevin, no.

33:30.786 --> 33:33.285
- What is he doing?
- Put your seatbelts on.

33:38.731 --> 33:39.899
What are you doing?

33:39.953 --> 33:41.667
Put your seatbelts on now.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.751
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:12.569 --> 34:14.577
- It's stuck. It's stuck.
- Shit.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.185
Stop!

34:32.251 --> 34:34.520
- Alex. Alex!
- Please.

34:34.587 --> 34:36.489
- Alex!
- Come with us.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.524
Please.

34:42.109 --> 34:44.953
Come on.

34:45.027 --> 34:46.562
Come on, get in the car. Come on.

35:18.395 --> 35:22.460
All of you died?

35:22.527 --> 35:24.729
It's all right.

35:27.211 --> 35:31.465
We all die.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.387
I'm dying.

35:59.283 --> 36:04.169
Aah!

36:10.450 --> 36:12.656
Is he alive?

36:12.695 --> 36:14.078
I'm sorry, sweetie.

36:14.145 --> 36:17.785
I'm so sorry.

36:17.824 --> 36:18.886
Oh...

36:26.548 --> 36:29.160
She took him.

37:32.149 --> 37:35.426
Jay saved my life.

37:35.493 --> 37:38.329
Just now, before we left.

37:42.964 --> 37:47.371
He was innocent.

38:52.587 --> 38:56.357
Bangor is right, Inland is
left. We could do either.

38:56.424 --> 38:58.259
Let's get out of this town.

38:58.326 --> 39:01.229
It can't be all over.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.697
It can't be everywhere.

39:02.763 --> 39:03.996
How do you know?

39:03.998 --> 39:06.767
I don't.

39:14.207 --> 39:15.241
Dad.

39:16.277 --> 39:18.430
What's that?

39:18.497 --> 39:20.446
Something's coming. It's getting closer.

39:23.818 --> 39:25.586
It's a train.

39:29.957 --> 39:32.358
- Where are you going?
- To the station.

39:32.405 --> 39:34.128
I can get there before it does.

39:34.195 --> 39:35.596
What if doesn't stop?

39:35.663 --> 39:38.566
We have to try.

39:38.633 --> 39:40.501
Dad, hurry.

39:44.071 --> 39:46.641
That's it.

39:57.852 --> 40:00.518
You sure this is a good idea?

40:00.573 --> 40:01.720
They can save us.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.228
Maybe it can get us out of here.

40:03.283 --> 40:04.700
With your wife.

40:04.747 --> 40:06.027
Turn off the light.

40:32.186 --> 40:35.342
What do we do?

40:35.443 --> 40:36.491
What are you crazy? We run.

40:36.554 --> 40:39.160
- They can rescue us.
- Wait!

40:43.197 --> 40:47.062
- Uh! Uh!
- Aah!

40:47.116 --> 40:49.704
- Get off!
- No!

40:51.272 --> 40:53.207
Get off! Get off!

40:54.442 --> 40:56.477
What are they doing?

41:10.491 --> 41:12.660
They're feeding it.
