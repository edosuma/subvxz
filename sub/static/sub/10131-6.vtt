09:16.097 --> 09:17.598
- I'm Danny Tanner.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.144
- Back up, back up. You got him.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.144
- I am Danny Tanner.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.189
Now, I'm really Danny Tanner

09:21.186 --> 09:24.189
and welcome to tonight's fight.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.107
We're in the training room

09:24.231 --> 09:26.107
of former heavyweight champion

09:26.149 --> 09:28.402
of the world,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.402
Reggie "The Sandman" Martin.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.904
Only moments away

09:28.443 --> 09:30.904
from the Sandman's first attempt

09:30.945 --> 09:34.366
on the comeback trail to reclaim

09:30.945 --> 09:34.366
his heavyweight crown.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.326
And here he is now.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.785
Well, champ, how you feeling?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.704
I feel good! I feel strong!

09:39.746 --> 09:42.999
I feel like

09:39.746 --> 09:42.999
hittin' somebody. Huh!

09:43.041 --> 09:44.334
But not me, right?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.461
That depends on the question.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.629
Okay, no pressure here.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.425
Well, champ, the obvious

09:48.671 --> 09:51.425
question...why the comeback?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.260
You've got plenty

09:51.466 --> 09:53.260
of money in the bank.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.636
Heck, you own a bank.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.556
You've been retired

09:55.678 --> 09:57.556
for two years. What is it?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.723
Do you miss wearing the shorts?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.475
- No, no, you see--

09:58.765 --> 10:00.475
- It's pride.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.018
It's pride and respect.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.811
The champ wants to go down

10:02.060 --> 10:03.811
as the greatest fighter

10:03.853 --> 10:05.855
in the history of boxing.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.941
Are you sure

10:05.897 --> 10:07.941
it's not the $6 million?

10:07.982 --> 10:10.569
Okay. I miss wearing the shorts.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.699
My tie tack!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.659
- Yay!

10:20.454 --> 10:21.996
I know why I'm wearing the cup.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.417
But, now, why are you

10:22.038 --> 10:25.417
wearing a saucer?

10:25.459 --> 10:28.462
Oh, this? This is a gift

10:25.459 --> 10:28.462
from my daughter Stephanie.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.713
And the tie is a gift

10:28.503 --> 10:30.713
from my daughter DJ.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.090
And I have a little baby

10:30.755 --> 10:32.090
Michelle, too.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.468
But you can't wear her gifts.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.052
- Yay!

10:37.762 --> 10:38.972
You probably haven't seen

10:37.762 --> 10:38.972
much of your family

10:39.013 --> 10:40.348
during these three months

10:39.013 --> 10:40.348
of training.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.642
Yeah. Lou runs

10:40.390 --> 10:42.642
a pretty tough camp.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.394
The toughest.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.686
Total isolation!

10:45.728 --> 10:48.523
Just me, the Sandman,

10:45.728 --> 10:48.523
and misery.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.108
[laughs]

10:48.565 --> 10:50.108
No phone calls

10:50.150 --> 10:51.734
no women, no nothing.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.236
Look, I-I'm sorry

10:51.776 --> 10:53.236
about that, Marcie.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.695
How you feeling, honey?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.741
I think it's wonderful

10:56.573 --> 10:58.741
that you and your wife

10:58.783 --> 11:00.452
are still good friends,

10:58.783 --> 11:00.452
considering..

11:00.494 --> 11:01.620
Yeah.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.787
Considering what?

11:04.289 --> 11:05.540
- You know--

11:04.289 --> 11:05.540
- Yeah, right, champ.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.874
Just loosen up, baby, loosen up.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.918
Hey, hey, hey.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.918
The man said "considering."

11:08.960 --> 11:11.004
Considering what?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.671
Uh, considering what happened.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.007
Loosen up, champ, huh?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.007
Just loosen--

11:14.048 --> 11:15.425
Hey, if I don't get

11:14.048 --> 11:15.425
some information

11:15.467 --> 11:16.926
I'm gonna loosen

11:15.467 --> 11:16.926
somebody's head.

11:16.968 --> 11:20.180
Now, you said, "It's great

11:16.968 --> 11:20.180
we're still friends."

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
Why wouldn't my wife

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
and I still be friends?

11:24.058 --> 11:25.726
So, about tonight's fight, um..

11:25.768 --> 11:27.187
- Let's talk strategy.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.187
- Hey, man.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.523
Let's forget

11:27.228 --> 11:29.523
about strategy, um..

11:29.564 --> 11:31.483
All I meant was, usually

11:29.564 --> 11:31.483
when a woman moves out on a man

11:31.525 --> 11:32.984
they stop being friends.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.277
She moved out?

11:34.319 --> 11:35.529
Champ, it's time to fight.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.529
Let's go.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.988
Hey, man, you expect me to fight

11:37.030 --> 11:38.781
when I just found out

11:37.030 --> 11:38.781
my wife walked out on me?

11:38.823 --> 11:42.202
Use it, champ!

11:38.823 --> 11:42.202
Use the anger!

11:42.243 --> 11:45.121
Oh, champ, I'm sorry.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.121
Oh, boy, am I sorry.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.998
I can't believe

11:45.163 --> 11:46.998
you didn't know about this.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.375
You calling me a liar?

11:48.416 --> 11:49.708
Oh, not at all.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.752
Why would I choose those

11:49.750 --> 11:51.752
as my last words?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.630
I..

11:53.672 --> 11:55.632
I just figured since the story

11:53.672 --> 11:55.632
was in the newspapers

11:55.674 --> 11:58.218
and the magazines

11:55.674 --> 11:58.218
and the soon-to-be TV movie.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.927
She left me?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.179
And sold the rights?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.681
Oh, no, Marcie, baby.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.933
No, no, no, baby, no.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.855
It'll be okay, champ,

12:08.102 --> 12:10.855
it-it'll be okay.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.732
You kind of taken the edge

12:10.897 --> 12:13.732
off him, eh, Tanner?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.819
You know, in a way

12:16.861 --> 12:19.239
this is kind

12:16.861 --> 12:19.239
of a beautiful moment.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.615
Thanks for sharing it with us.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.866
And, Sandman..

12:21.908 --> 12:23.951
...best of luck

12:21.908 --> 12:23.951
on tonight's fight.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.245
Fight?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.705
I-I can't fight.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.582
- Come on, champ, you'll fight.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.582
- I can't fight now.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.000
You'll fight, champ. You'll

12:28.623 --> 12:31.000
fight and knock him out, champ.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.420
You're gonna win it.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.420
You're gonna win it, baby.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.088
Why was that man crying?

12:35.129 --> 12:37.507
Well, the man was crying

12:35.129 --> 12:37.507
because, uh..

12:37.549 --> 12:39.634
...because your dad

12:37.549 --> 12:39.634
made him so happy.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.429
I don't think so.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
We'll be back,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
after this word

12:45.139 --> 12:47.141
from anybody but me.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.273
Now what happens?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.149
Well, two guys beat

12:53.314 --> 12:55.149
each other up

12:55.191 --> 12:58.027
for about 36 minutes,

12:55.191 --> 12:58.027
then they get $6 million.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.988
$6 million?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.283
Forget about being a ballerina.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.496
Ah, maybe you girls shouldn't

13:05.118 --> 13:08.496
be watching all this violence.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.748
Joey's right, Steph.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.999
Let's go watch

13:09.788 --> 13:11.999
reruns of the "A-Team."

13:14.753 --> 13:16.463
[Michelle coughs]

13:16.504 --> 13:17.880
You hear that?

13:16.504 --> 13:17.880
She coughed again.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.924
This cough is getting serious.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.302
I'll think of something.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.679
- What are you doing?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.679
- Calling the baby's doctor.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.515
Good. I knew

13:24.721 --> 13:27.515
I'd think of something.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.642
Here.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.850
Hello, Dr. Landress?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.728
You're home?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.313
You answer your own phone?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.650
Are you any good?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.610
Yeah, I'm calling

13:36.691 --> 13:38.610
about Michelle Tanner.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.695
She's, um, she's coughing.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.946
Hold on, doc.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.156
He wants to know

13:41.988 --> 13:43.156
what kind of cough.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.198
What do you mean, what kind of..

13:44.240 --> 13:45.283
It's a little baby's cough

13:45.325 --> 13:46.284
like, you know, like, eh-eh.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.868
- Like that.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.868
- No.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.496
Doc, I do impressions

13:47.910 --> 13:49.496
for a living.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.581
It was more like, uh, ah-eh.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.375
Give me the phone.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.085
I'm sorry. We're new parents.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.211
Alright. Come here.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.296
Listen to Michelle cough.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.589
There you go.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.589
Cough, Michelle.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.882
Come on, cough. Come on.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.551
It's just like when you

14:01.924 --> 14:03.551
take your car to the mechanic.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.553
It never makes that same noise.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.973
Alright.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.476
Her nose? Yeah, it's running

14:09.015 --> 14:11.476
like a fountain.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.603
What's coming out of it?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.603
Diet cola.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.694
Fever? I don't know.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.362
Of course, I know how

14:20.735 --> 14:22.362
to take her temperature.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.864
You simply put

14:22.403 --> 14:24.864
the thermometer under her ton..

14:29.786 --> 14:31.579
I put it where?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.458
Joey, it's for you.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.836
To the left and tilt down

14:37.877 --> 14:39.713
to the right.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.422
Normal! No temperature.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.549
High five, Michelle.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.300
High five, high five.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.303
High five. Alright.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.557
Okay, well, doctor said

14:47.345 --> 14:50.557
no fever means it's a cold

14:50.598 --> 14:52.099
'and we should give

14:50.598 --> 14:52.099
her the medicine'

14:52.141 --> 14:53.727
that he prescribed

14:52.141 --> 14:53.727
for the last cold.

14:53.768 --> 14:57.146
Okay, we got strawberry mousse

14:57.188 --> 14:59.566
apricot conditioner..

14:59.607 --> 15:00.983
...honey-nut rinse.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
Can you believe

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
these girls put all this

15:02.485 --> 15:04.237
dumb junk in their hair?

15:08.658 --> 15:09.784
It's mine.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.953
'Would you look at that?'

15:12.995 --> 15:15.122
Alright, here it is.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.875
"Michelle Tanner, half a

15:15.164 --> 15:16.875
teaspoon. 4 times a day."

15:16.916 --> 15:18.251
- Remember that.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.251
- Alright, alright.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.253
- Give me that. Give me that.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.253
- Okay.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.589
The fight's over. They said

15:20.294 --> 15:22.589
dad will be back on

15:22.630 --> 15:24.465
after these important messages.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.342
Okay.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.302
What are you doing to Michelle?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.847
We're giving your sister

15:28.344 --> 15:30.847
some medicine.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.640
That's not the way

15:30.889 --> 15:32.640
daddy does it.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.267
Stephanie..

15:34.308 --> 15:35.602
Alright, here you go, Michelle.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.728
[Michelle coos]

15:41.399 --> 15:42.525
Joey, duck!

15:54.203 --> 15:57.164
Well, so much for cough syrup

15:54.203 --> 15:57.164
and pureed chicken.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.499
I told you it wouldn't work.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.085
You never serve red cough syrup

15:58.541 --> 16:01.085
with poultry.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.881
By the way, if I'm ever sick..

16:04.923 --> 16:06.299
...dial 911.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.802
Daddy's on!

16:08.843 --> 16:11.262
Okay. Come on.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.513
Well, fans, you saw it.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.390
A minute 17

16:12.555 --> 16:14.390
into the second round

16:14.432 --> 16:16.601
Reggie "The Sandman" Martin

16:14.432 --> 16:16.601
was KO'd.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.102
'He may have been

16:16.643 --> 16:18.102
a little off tonight.'

16:18.144 --> 16:19.771
That happens.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.021
But I don't think

16:19.813 --> 16:21.021
the blame should be laid

16:21.063 --> 16:22.440
at anybody's feet.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.818
I mean anybody.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.818
Am I being clear?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.360
A blameless defeat.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.946
Hey, Tanner!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.030
How does it feel

16:27.987 --> 16:30.030
to have personally dealt

16:30.072 --> 16:32.408
a crushing blow

16:30.072 --> 16:32.408
to a man's career?

16:32.450 --> 16:34.953
Are you talking

16:32.450 --> 16:34.953
about The Sandman's or my own?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.830
Hey, tell me, do you have

16:34.994 --> 16:36.830
some sort of personal grudge

16:36.871 --> 16:38.289
against the Sandman?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.124
Not at all, the Sandman and I

16:38.331 --> 16:40.124
have always had

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
a very warm

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
and cordial relationship.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.128
I want him! I want him!

16:44.170 --> 16:47.089
I want Danny Tanner!

16:44.170 --> 16:47.089
I want him! I want him!

16:48.842 --> 16:50.802
Can't you just feel the love?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.973
- Ooh.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.350
- Ooh.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.186
Walk with me..

17:00.227 --> 17:01.980
...as I apologize..

17:02.021 --> 17:04.774
...to the Sandman.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.861
Sandman, I am really

17:04.816 --> 17:07.861
very, very sorry.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.238
It's okay.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.950
It's not your fault.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.619
At least somebody had the guts

17:13.992 --> 17:16.619
to tell me about my wife.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.245
Say..

17:18.287 --> 17:19.622
...you wouldn't happen to know

17:19.664 --> 17:22.291
why she left me, would you?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.543
Well, maybe not seeing your wife

17:23.584 --> 17:24.878
for three or four months

17:24.919 --> 17:27.630
resulted in a teensy loss

17:24.919 --> 17:27.630
of intimacy.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.632
It's okay, champ.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.632
We don't need her.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.967
It's this "we" stuff.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.636
It's this "we" stuff

17:31.009 --> 17:33.636
that got me in trouble.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.888
You talked me

17:33.678 --> 17:34.888
out of of retirement

17:34.929 --> 17:36.514
because you needed the money.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.308
Now, you knew about my wife

17:36.556 --> 17:39.308
all the time, didn't you?

17:39.350 --> 17:40.935
Well, I kind of got an inkling

17:40.977 --> 17:43.980
when I saw the cover story

17:40.977 --> 17:43.980
in "Sports Illustrated."

17:44.022 --> 17:45.398
Look, Marcie-Marcie, honey

Can we stay up

18:27.523 --> 18:29.275

No, no, no, girls. Go to sleep.

Come on, get some rest.

Nothing. She just

from all those little bumps

so that you'll be better
