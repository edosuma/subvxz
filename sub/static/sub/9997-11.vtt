WEBVTT

00:01.948 --> 00:03.983
It's so annoying, right?

00:04.050 --> 00:06.051
Yeah. They change the street-cleaning days,

00:06.119 --> 00:08.754
And no one tells you it's on Tuesday now.

00:08.822 --> 00:11.223
I got a $65 ticket.

00:11.291 --> 00:12.958
Yeah, I probably should fight it,

00:13.026 --> 00:14.394
But I mean, come on, who has time

00:14.461 --> 00:17.030
To take a half day off
and go to traffic court?

00:17.097 --> 00:20.600
all right, well,
I got to take a shower, so...

00:20.668 --> 00:23.336
We're still on for tonight, though, right?

00:23.404 --> 00:24.337
Okay.

00:24.405 --> 00:27.073
Yep, I will see you then. Bye.

00:28.776 --> 00:31.644
Well... Looks like it's
your lucky day, jinx.

00:31.712 --> 00:34.914
I am all out of dry food.

00:36.483 --> 00:38.284
Oh.

00:38.352 --> 00:39.385
Hello?

00:39.453 --> 00:40.520
Naomi?

00:40.587 --> 00:43.089
Uh, no, I'm sorry, this is gretchen.

00:43.157 --> 00:45.658
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:45.726 --> 00:46.959
Is naomi there?

00:47.027 --> 00:49.429
Uh, no, there's no one named naomi here,

00:49.496 --> 00:52.098
So, um, I think you have the wrong number.

00:52.166 --> 00:53.166
Really?

00:53.233 --> 00:54.467
No, she has to be.

00:54.535 --> 00:56.069
She waited on me the other night,

00:56.136 --> 00:57.837
And we kind of hit it off.

00:57.905 --> 00:59.372
This is the number she gave me.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.408
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to be
the one to break it to you,

01:02.476 --> 01:05.311
But I think maybe this naomi,
whoever she is,

01:05.379 --> 01:07.847
She might not want to actually talk to you,

01:07.915 --> 01:10.016
So... Sorry. Bye.

01:10.084 --> 01:13.086
All right, jinx, chow time.

01:13.153 --> 01:14.620
Hop to it.

01:15.656 --> 01:17.290
Lazy dog.

01:20.594 --> 01:21.594
Hello?

01:21.662 --> 01:23.429
Okay, here's the thing.

01:23.497 --> 01:25.131
I know naomi's there,

01:25.199 --> 01:27.934
So stop playing around
and let me talk to her.

01:28.001 --> 01:30.036
Wow, you've really got a problem.

01:30.104 --> 01:32.138
Now, listen to me, okay?

01:32.206 --> 01:34.006
There is no naomi here,

01:34.074 --> 01:36.275
There are no waitresses that live here,

01:36.343 --> 01:39.312
And there is no one here
that wants to talk to you.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.447
Yes, there is... 

01:43.650 --> 01:45.651
Hey. Up and at 'em.

01:50.023 --> 01:51.624
Oh, my god.

01:51.692 --> 01:52.959
Jinx?

01:59.833 --> 02:01.834
Oh, my god...

02:03.070 --> 02:04.203
Hello?

02:04.271 --> 02:07.006
Tell that bitch naomi to come to the phone.

02:07.074 --> 02:08.640
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

02:08.709 --> 02:09.976
Stop calling me, okay?

02:10.043 --> 02:11.878
I can't deal with you right now.

02:11.945 --> 02:13.246
I have an emergency.

02:13.313 --> 02:17.650
A dead dog is not an emergency.

02:18.819 --> 02:20.820
Who is this?

02:23.357 --> 02:24.924
Okay... 

02:24.992 --> 02:26.993
I'm gonna go get your... Your pen,

02:27.060 --> 02:29.362
A-and I'm taking you to the vet.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074

03:25.870 --> 03:27.604
When you're finished,
bring your plates to the sink.

03:27.672 --> 03:29.939
It's almost 8:00. We got to get a move on.

03:30.007 --> 03:31.274
Dad? Yeah?

03:31.942 --> 03:33.743
Wh-why are you dressed like that?

03:33.810 --> 03:36.145
I mean, aren't you going to work today?

03:36.213 --> 03:37.346
Uh, yes, I am.

03:37.414 --> 03:38.948
I'm meeting my boss for lunch,

03:39.016 --> 03:42.985
And he's kind of a laid-back,
casual kind of guy, so...

03:43.053 --> 03:45.454
So you decided to dress sloppy?

03:45.522 --> 03:47.657
Does, uh,

03:47.724 --> 03:49.625
Does mom know you're dressed that way?

03:49.693 --> 03:52.461
Mom is not here. Mom went to work early.

03:52.529 --> 03:54.497
And besides, she's your mom, she's not mine.

03:54.564 --> 03:57.333
I decide what is appropriate
for me to wear to work.

03:57.401 --> 03:58.701
Well, it, um,

03:58.769 --> 04:00.736
It just seems strange.

04:00.804 --> 04:01.837
Yes, it is strange.

04:01.905 --> 04:03.339
This guy never has lunch with anyone,

04:03.407 --> 04:04.874
And suddenly he shoots me an e-mail

04:04.941 --> 04:06.609
Saying he wants to eat with me today.

04:06.677 --> 04:08.144
I know where he likes to go.

04:08.211 --> 04:10.012
It's just this little
hole in the wall, so...

04:10.080 --> 04:11.147
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

04:11.214 --> 04:13.049
Y-you're the one who's always telling us

04:13.116 --> 04:14.617
To "be yourself."

04:14.685 --> 04:15.818
Well, come on, this is me.

04:15.886 --> 04:17.653
This is just more of a-a weekend kind of me.

04:17.721 --> 04:19.221
Uh...

04:20.390 --> 04:22.692
You know what? I'm gonna change.

04:26.296 --> 04:28.431
Naomi clark

04:28.498 --> 04:30.199
Has been missing for five days now.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.468
Isn't it safe to assume
she's already been murdered?

04:32.536 --> 04:33.769
Absolutely not.

04:33.837 --> 04:35.971
Miss clarke is still
classified as a missing person.

04:36.039 --> 04:37.973
But the three other victims were all dead

04:38.041 --> 04:39.709
Within five days of being abducted.

04:39.776 --> 04:41.977
That's true, that has
been the pattern thus far,

04:42.045 --> 04:43.979
But that doesn't mean it's
a foregone conclusion.

04:44.047 --> 04:45.715
Naomi clarke's family is holding out hope

04:45.782 --> 04:47.717
That she's still alive, and so am I.

04:48.785 --> 04:49.785
Other than that,

04:49.853 --> 04:51.487
I don't have much new to report.

04:51.555 --> 04:53.923
The mayor is doubling the
size of the task force,

04:53.990 --> 04:55.358
Uh, devoted to finding the killer,

04:55.425 --> 04:56.592
And we are aggressively pursuing

04:56.660 --> 04:58.561
Each and every lead as it comes in.

04:58.628 --> 05:00.463
So what do you make of his name,

05:00.530 --> 05:01.931
"the penny jar killer"?

05:01.998 --> 05:04.367
You know, 'cause he leaves
the body of his last victim

05:04.434 --> 05:06.001
Inside the home of his next victim?

05:06.069 --> 05:08.738
"take a penny, leave a penny." cute, right?

05:08.805 --> 05:11.841
The man slaughters innocent women.

05:11.908 --> 05:13.843
There's nothing cute about him.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.511
Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:17.147 --> 05:20.916
yeah, that's her, naomi clarke.

05:20.984 --> 05:22.318
The killer left her body

05:22.386 --> 05:25.221
In what I can only guess
is the next victim's house.

05:25.288 --> 05:26.856
She was hanging in the closet.

05:26.923 --> 05:28.491
She was bound by electrical tape.

05:28.558 --> 05:30.359
She was still wearing her waitress uniform.

05:30.427 --> 05:32.495
It had a name tag that said "naomi."

05:32.562 --> 05:34.730
And you got a good look at this next victim?

05:34.798 --> 05:37.800
I know her first name's gretchen.

05:37.868 --> 05:40.136
Oh, uh, and in the... In the dream,

05:40.203 --> 05:42.938
She-she'd gotten a parking ticket.

05:43.006 --> 05:46.242
For parking on the wrong side of
the street for street-cleaning.

05:46.309 --> 05:47.710
It was Tuesday.

05:47.778 --> 05:49.078
Today's a Tuesday.

05:49.146 --> 05:51.814
Traffic ticket-- I might be
able to do something with that.

05:51.882 --> 05:53.182
Traffic police use handheld computers

05:53.250 --> 05:54.583
To give out tickets now.

05:54.651 --> 05:56.085
They go right on to the system.

05:56.153 --> 05:57.453
I'll get someone to monitor it.

05:57.521 --> 05:59.021
Soon as we hear that a car

05:59.089 --> 06:01.056
Registered to a woman named
gretchen gets a ticket,

06:01.124 --> 06:03.392
We should be able to
find out where she lives.

06:05.028 --> 06:07.897
* *

06:10.700 --> 06:13.169
Keith!

06:13.236 --> 06:14.570
Hi.

06:14.638 --> 06:15.905
Joe.

06:15.972 --> 06:17.473
Hey.

06:19.676 --> 06:21.410
I appreciate this.

06:21.478 --> 06:22.912
No, listen, got to eat lunch.

06:22.979 --> 06:25.147
I just, uh, you didn't
mention in your e-mail

06:25.215 --> 06:27.683
Why you wanted to get together,
so I, uh, I just...

06:27.751 --> 06:30.052
I didn't quite know if I was
supposed to prepare something...

06:30.120 --> 06:31.487
It's not about your performance review

06:31.555 --> 06:32.822
Or anything like that.

06:32.889 --> 06:34.690
I mean, I'm very aware that that's tomorrow.

06:34.758 --> 06:36.592
So you can put your mind at ease.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.227
It has nothing to do with that.

06:38.295 --> 06:40.496
In fact, I'd go as far as to say

06:40.564 --> 06:43.065
That you have nothing to
worry about in that regard.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.767
Oh. Hi there.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.069
Oh, that's okay, I'll just
have what I always have.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.405
Oh, I'll just have what he's having.

06:49.473 --> 06:52.041
Sure you want to do that?

06:52.108 --> 06:53.042
Sure.

06:53.109 --> 06:54.610
Sure I'm sure.

06:56.112 --> 06:59.114
I'll tell you why I e-mailed you.

07:00.283 --> 07:02.451
The truth is...

07:02.519 --> 07:04.487
I need a favor.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.889
Oh, sure, keith, no problem.

07:06.957 --> 07:08.924
What can I do for you?

07:08.992 --> 07:10.893
Well, when I think of you,

07:10.961 --> 07:12.962
As opposed to anybody else I work with,

07:13.029 --> 07:14.964
Any of the other engineers,

07:15.031 --> 07:20.569
I think of you as someone
who is very... Regular.

07:20.637 --> 07:23.272
Regular? Yeah.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.673
Regular, you know?

07:24.741 --> 07:26.342
Like, not strange.

07:26.409 --> 07:28.010
Pretty normal, right?

07:28.078 --> 07:29.979
Y-you're married, you have a family,

07:30.046 --> 07:31.580
You have some kids.

07:31.648 --> 07:34.450
Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm pretty regular.

07:34.518 --> 07:37.453
Good. Because I'd like to
share something with you

07:37.521 --> 07:40.356
That I haven't shared with
anybody else I work with.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.157
Okay.

07:49.399 --> 07:50.933
There you go.

07:51.001 --> 07:52.801
What's this?

07:52.869 --> 07:55.104
That is my novel.

07:55.171 --> 07:56.539
It's on that drive.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.774
I want you to read it,

07:58.842 --> 08:01.443
And I want you to be
brutally honest with me.

08:01.511 --> 08:03.145
Your novel?

08:03.213 --> 08:04.446
Yeah.

08:04.514 --> 08:07.416
I started writing it when...

08:07.484 --> 08:10.586
<i>When did the first lord of the rings movie
come out?</i>

08:10.654 --> 08:11.720
Uh...

08:11.788 --> 08:13.122
Here's your chocolate milk.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.558
And here's your chocolate milk.

08:17.561 --> 08:19.828
Your entrees will be right out.

08:19.896 --> 08:21.330
Great. Great.

08:21.398 --> 08:23.666
Great.

08:23.733 --> 08:25.234
Thank you.

08:27.771 --> 08:30.873
Okay, turns out there was
a girl named gretchen,

08:30.941 --> 08:32.908
And she did get a parking ticket.

08:32.976 --> 08:34.943
Gretchen morgan got a parking
ticket at 11:25 this morning.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.645
I'm on my way over to her place now.

08:36.712 --> 08:38.681
You want come in my car,
or you want to follow?

08:41.585 --> 08:44.453
Wait a second, you're
telling me that that man,

08:44.521 --> 08:47.656
The penny jar killer,
you think he's after me?

08:47.724 --> 08:50.292
Well, again, we're responding
to an anonymous tip.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.927
Um, it may turn out

08:51.995 --> 08:55.564
To be nothing once we take a look around.

09:01.004 --> 09:03.005
Lee.

09:04.507 --> 09:06.208
Oh.

09:06.276 --> 09:08.444
Excuse me for one second.

09:26.329 --> 09:28.097
What about your dog?

09:28.164 --> 09:29.164
Excuse me?

09:29.232 --> 09:30.799
You have a dog, don't you?

09:30.867 --> 09:33.202
Jinxy, wake up.

09:35.071 --> 09:36.405
Baby.

09:38.308 --> 09:40.809
Oh, my god.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.566
Hey, lee. Lee.

10:06.936 --> 10:10.673
You see that kid over there,
he's got black work gloves?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.207
Got the same kind of tape

10:12.275 --> 10:13.809
That I saw covering naomi's mouth.

10:17.614 --> 10:18.947
Sir, police.

10:19.015 --> 10:21.650
You mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

10:34.564 --> 10:36.632
Name's jeremy kiernan.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.167
Couple of priors for drug possession;

10:38.234 --> 10:39.368
One conviction for harassment.

10:39.436 --> 10:40.703
Harassment?

10:40.770 --> 10:42.371
Legalese for "stalking."

10:42.439 --> 10:45.107
22-year-old girl-- 30 days plus probation.

10:45.175 --> 10:46.475
So you think this is him?

10:46.543 --> 10:48.310
You think this is the penny jar killer?

10:48.378 --> 10:50.145
Well, it's sure starting to look that way.

10:50.213 --> 10:52.014
Electrician's assistant lived about

10:52.082 --> 10:53.615
A mile away from gretchen's house.

10:53.683 --> 10:56.618
His job took him close to the
homes of the other victims.

10:56.686 --> 10:57.886
We may have a match.

10:57.954 --> 11:00.789
I got people scouring his
apartment and his car.

11:00.857 --> 11:02.891
He's got to be hiding the
body of that other girl,

11:02.959 --> 11:04.226
The, uh, the waitress somewhere.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.662
Plus, you don't turn tail
and run from the cops

11:06.730 --> 11:09.164
If you don't have something to hide.

11:09.232 --> 11:11.133
I'm gonna go call manny, give him an update.

11:11.201 --> 11:12.835
But, uh, thanks for the "anonymous tip."

11:12.902 --> 11:14.570
Mm-hmm.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.540
I wasn't running because of that.

11:22.846 --> 11:23.979
I'm sorry?

11:24.047 --> 11:27.516
I wasn't running because I killed someone.

11:27.584 --> 11:30.552
I would never kill anybody.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.354
I heard what that guy said.

11:33.623 --> 11:35.491
A long time ago,

11:35.558 --> 11:37.926
There was a girl.

11:37.994 --> 11:40.662
I liked her more than she liked me.

11:40.730 --> 11:43.599
You want to call that stalking.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.802
But following someone,
calling them on the phone too much,

11:46.870 --> 11:48.036
That's not murder.

11:48.104 --> 11:49.605
Okay.

11:49.672 --> 11:51.106
So why did you run then?

11:51.174 --> 11:53.809
I had a joint in my pocket.

11:55.812 --> 11:58.647
Would've been my third strike.

11:58.715 --> 12:00.048
You would've run, too.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.052
Okay, then explain the gloves.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.854
Explain the electrical tape.

12:05.922 --> 12:08.957
I'm an electrician.

12:09.025 --> 12:12.594
Okay, well, I believe that,
but the rest of this...

12:12.662 --> 12:13.595
So...

12:13.663 --> 12:16.431
What can I do to convince you?

12:19.469 --> 12:20.569
Sorry.

12:20.637 --> 12:21.637
I startle you?

12:28.645 --> 12:29.778
<i> I just don't get it.</i>

12:29.846 --> 12:31.146
<i>Why wouldn't he admit it?</i>

12:31.214 --> 12:33.015
Tell me where the girl's body is?

12:33.082 --> 12:34.850
What's the point in denying everything?

12:34.918 --> 12:36.652
He's dead.

12:36.719 --> 12:38.654
Well, he just got hit by a car.

12:38.721 --> 12:40.789
That can have a way of
clouding your thinking.

12:40.857 --> 12:42.090
Plus, he's a murderer.

12:42.158 --> 12:44.426
I mean, I haven't actually
read the rule book,

12:44.494 --> 12:48.030
But my guess is that the number
one rule at serial killer club

12:48.097 --> 12:51.099
Is that if somebody asks
you if you are one, say no.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.601
Actually, I wish I was reading

12:52.669 --> 12:54.636
The serial killer club rule book.

12:54.704 --> 12:56.371
It's that bad?

12:58.741 --> 13:00.742
I'm, I mean, I'm just a hundred pages in,

13:00.810 --> 13:03.812
But, I mean, maybe it'll pick up, but...

13:03.880 --> 13:05.948
This thing sucks like a hoover.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.016
I should be grateful.

13:08.084 --> 13:09.518
At least he gave it to me

13:09.586 --> 13:11.753
The day before my performance review.

13:11.821 --> 13:14.223
I mean, he can't expect me to
read this thing in one night.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.325
It's over 900 pages.

13:23.199 --> 13:24.132
Hello.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.567
Hey, it's lee.

13:25.635 --> 13:28.370
Sorry to bug you at home, but,
uh, I got some bad news.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.838
When we left gretchen morgan's place today,

13:29.906 --> 13:31.106
She was pretty shaken up.

13:31.174 --> 13:33.008
She had a friend come
spend the night with her.

13:33.076 --> 13:34.343
He went out to grab some takeout,

13:34.410 --> 13:35.911
And when he came back, she was gone.

13:35.979 --> 13:37.145
Oh, no.

13:37.213 --> 13:38.180
Oh, yeah.

13:38.248 --> 13:39.781
And when we opened up the closet,

13:39.849 --> 13:41.950
We found naomi clarke.

13:42.018 --> 13:43.819
Looks like we were wrong, allison.

13:43.887 --> 13:45.854
Unless this guy got up off that morgue slab

13:45.922 --> 13:47.689
And strung this girl up by her wrists,

13:47.757 --> 13:50.659
Jeremy kiernan was not the penny jar killer.

14:01.036 --> 14:02.637
It's not my fault.

14:02.705 --> 14:03.938
I didn't make a peep.

14:04.006 --> 14:06.341
It's your brain; I can hear it whirring.

14:06.408 --> 14:09.978
I can't help it, it is whirring.

14:10.045 --> 14:12.180
I just feel terrible.

14:12.248 --> 14:14.349
That man is dead.

14:14.416 --> 14:17.051
He'd be alive if I hadn't
pointed him out to the police.

14:17.119 --> 14:18.052
Okay.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.788
Maybe.

14:20.856 --> 14:22.657
We can't be sure.

14:22.725 --> 14:23.725
Can't we?

14:23.792 --> 14:25.360
No. You're not god.

14:25.427 --> 14:27.629
At least not last time I looked.

14:27.696 --> 14:29.831
I don't even want to think
about what that would make me.

14:29.899 --> 14:31.065
Okay, not funny.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.400
You're joking and I feel like

14:32.468 --> 14:34.602
I've got this man's blood on my hands.

14:34.670 --> 14:35.803
You don't.

14:35.871 --> 14:37.705
You didn't put that joint in his pocket.

14:37.773 --> 14:39.774
You didn't make him run.

14:39.842 --> 14:41.242
Maybe not.

14:41.310 --> 14:44.245
Still, some job I did today.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.856
* imagine me and you, I do *

14:54.924 --> 14:57.191
* I think about you day and night *

14:57.259 --> 14:58.359
* it's only right *

14:58.427 --> 15:01.529
* to think about the girl you love *

15:01.597 --> 15:03.097
* and hold her tight *

15:03.165 --> 15:05.433
* so happy together *

15:07.670 --> 15:10.738
* if I should call you up, invest a dime *

15:10.806 --> 15:14.442
* and you say you belong
to me and ease my mind *

15:14.510 --> 15:18.746
* imagine how the world could be,
so very fine *

15:18.814 --> 15:23.918
* so happy together *

15:23.986 --> 15:27.922
* I can't see me loving nobody but you *

15:27.990 --> 15:31.859
* for all my life *

15:31.927 --> 15:34.529
* when you're with me, baby *

15:34.597 --> 15:39.734
* the skies will be blue for all my life *

15:39.802 --> 15:42.537
* me and you and you and me *

15:42.605 --> 15:46.641
* no matter how they tossed
the dice, it had to be *

15:46.709 --> 15:50.278
* the only one for me
is you and you for me *

15:50.346 --> 15:55.783
* so happy together *

16:13.702 --> 16:14.802
* me and you... *

16:19.475 --> 16:21.042
She's amazing, isn't she?

16:27.883 --> 16:30.785
I hate being dead.

16:32.488 --> 16:34.389
Jeremy...

16:34.456 --> 16:37.358
What are you doing here?

16:37.426 --> 16:41.262
Well, seeing as how I'm not a serial killer,

16:41.330 --> 16:44.866
And now you know I'm not a serial killer,

16:44.933 --> 16:47.535
And seeing as how you and
your friends kind of,

16:47.603 --> 16:49.437
You know, killed me today,

16:49.505 --> 16:54.242
And seeing as how you're the
only one who can see me,

16:54.309 --> 16:57.311
I was hoping we could talk about something.

16:59.615 --> 17:01.616
Not here.

17:01.684 --> 17:03.818
<i> You want me to talk to
your girlfriend?</i>

17:03.886 --> 17:07.888
I need her to know that...

17:07.955 --> 17:10.657
I love her.

17:10.726 --> 17:13.361
And I need her to know about you.

17:15.396 --> 17:16.564
About me?

17:16.632 --> 17:19.067
I need her to know that

17:19.134 --> 17:23.738
Even though it feels like I'm gone,
I'm still here.

17:23.806 --> 17:26.374
I can still help her.

17:26.442 --> 17:29.711
'cause I can see her and you can see me,

17:29.778 --> 17:31.913
So I can still be there for her.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.415
I can help her do the
things she needs to do.

17:34.483 --> 17:36.017
Wait a second.

17:36.085 --> 17:39.620
Let's just take me out of this for a second.

17:39.688 --> 17:43.024
I don't think those kinds of things...

17:43.092 --> 17:44.859
Can be said.

17:44.927 --> 17:49.263
Those are the kinds of
things that need to be felt.

17:49.331 --> 17:52.667
And the truth is, once her pain subsides,

17:52.735 --> 17:54.769
She will feel them.

17:54.837 --> 17:56.671
So you won't do it?

17:56.739 --> 17:58.039
I don't think it's smart.

17:58.107 --> 18:00.007
No.

18:00.075 --> 18:04.045
I mean, and the truth is,
once your pain subsides,

18:04.113 --> 18:06.814
You're not gonna want to hang around here.

18:06.882 --> 18:09.383
You're gonna want to move on

18:09.451 --> 18:12.253
To wherever it is that
you're supposed to go.

18:14.289 --> 18:16.591
You don't get it.

18:16.658 --> 18:19.393
Our love is different.

18:19.461 --> 18:21.462
Our love is forever.

18:21.530 --> 18:23.498
I know that you believe that.

18:23.565 --> 18:24.866
I'm not saying that's not true.

18:24.933 --> 18:28.236
And you got to know that I feel horrible

18:28.303 --> 18:31.806
About everything that has happened to you.

18:31.874 --> 18:33.307
But I just can't do it.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.443
I just, I can't do something that I know

18:35.511 --> 18:38.312
Is gonna cause a lot of
heartache down the line.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.947
I just can't do it.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.718
So what about that penny jar guy?

18:43.786 --> 18:45.319
What?

18:45.387 --> 18:46.654
What about him?

18:48.524 --> 18:52.460
I can see everything from here.

18:52.528 --> 18:55.863
I'm pretty sure, if I put my mind to it,

18:55.931 --> 18:58.933
I could find out who he is for you.

18:59.001 --> 19:01.169
And I'd be willing to do that.

19:01.236 --> 19:04.739
I'd be willing to help you.

19:04.807 --> 19:07.675
But I need you to be willing to help me.

19:13.715 --> 19:17.251
Oh, uh, hey, brian,
can you give us a couple of minutes?

19:17.319 --> 19:19.320
Absolutely.

19:28.430 --> 19:29.363
So?

19:29.431 --> 19:30.464
So?

19:30.532 --> 19:31.465
What'd you think?

19:31.533 --> 19:34.202
The book?

19:34.269 --> 19:36.137
Uh, well, I mean, I'm only about

19:36.205 --> 19:38.506
A hundred and so pages into it, so...

19:38.574 --> 19:40.541
Wow.

19:40.609 --> 19:41.576
Okay.

19:41.643 --> 19:43.511
So you were able to put it down?

19:43.579 --> 19:45.146
Well, I'm not saying it was easy.

19:45.214 --> 19:46.180
No.

19:46.248 --> 19:47.548
But, you know, like you said yesterday,

19:47.616 --> 19:49.784
I'm kind of a regular guy,
so, you know, I got kids

19:49.852 --> 19:51.819
To put to bed, I got a wife I got

19:51.887 --> 19:53.254
To spend some time with. Yeah, no, no.

19:53.322 --> 19:54.822
Of course, of course.

19:56.825 --> 19:58.826
So what'd you think?

20:00.863 --> 20:03.798
From what I've read?

20:03.866 --> 20:05.199
You really want that?

20:05.267 --> 20:07.368
Wouldn't you rather wait
till I finish the whole thing

20:07.436 --> 20:08.669
Before I give you an opinion?

20:08.737 --> 20:10.705
Uh, no.

20:10.772 --> 20:13.407
I mean, is there some rule
that says you can't give me

20:13.475 --> 20:16.677
An opinion now and then another
opinion when you're finished?

20:16.745 --> 20:17.678
No.

20:17.746 --> 20:19.747
No, I s-suppose not.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.952
So...

20:25.020 --> 20:26.821
So, uh...

20:26.889 --> 20:29.657
Yeah, so...

20:29.725 --> 20:31.425
I think it's-it's interesting.

20:31.493 --> 20:33.694
That's it?

20:33.762 --> 20:35.029
Just interesting?

20:35.097 --> 20:37.899
No, it's not just interesting.

20:37.966 --> 20:39.767
I think you made some brave choices.

20:39.835 --> 20:43.070
Thank you.

20:43.138 --> 20:47.541
Look, I-I know that this
is really awkward for you,

20:47.609 --> 20:49.543
But I want you to be honest with me.

20:49.611 --> 20:51.479
I am, I am. I'm being honest.

20:51.546 --> 20:54.949
No, I know you're being honest.

20:55.017 --> 20:59.487
If I forced you, if I,
if I made you say something negative...

20:59.554 --> 21:01.923
You want something negative?

21:01.990 --> 21:03.257
There's-there's got to be something.

21:03.325 --> 21:04.558
Right?

21:04.626 --> 21:06.360
You know, you put it down, so...

21:06.428 --> 21:07.561
I know this is hard.

21:07.629 --> 21:08.763
I just... Well, it is hard.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.164
You know, I'm not, I'm not having

21:10.232 --> 21:11.632
A negative experience, uh, so far.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.501
So I don't know if I'm
comfortable being negative.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.202
You're not being negative.

21:15.270 --> 21:17.838
You know, I'm-I'm asking
you to be constructive.

21:17.906 --> 21:19.874
Right?

21:19.942 --> 21:22.677
Can you give me, uh, a word?

21:22.744 --> 21:23.945
Like, one word.

21:24.012 --> 21:27.581
An-an adjective, a negative adjective.

21:27.649 --> 21:28.783
Can-can you do that?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.551
I don't know.

21:30.619 --> 21:32.086
Yeah, you can.

21:32.154 --> 21:33.487
Just-just think.

21:33.555 --> 21:35.156
I don't know.

21:35.223 --> 21:37.325
I don't know.

21:37.392 --> 21:40.328
Uh, maybe... Diffuse?

21:42.931 --> 21:45.032
Diffuse?

21:45.100 --> 21:48.102
What the hell does that mean?

21:48.170 --> 21:51.572
Diffuse, uh, well, let me see-- diffuse--

21:51.640 --> 21:54.575
It means kind, like, all over the place.

21:54.643 --> 21:57.211
I know what it means.

21:57.279 --> 22:00.081
Well, you know, that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

22:00.148 --> 22:02.149
Diffuse.

22:02.217 --> 22:04.018
Again, I'm only a hundred pages in.

22:04.086 --> 22:06.053
So you know, I think I need time to...

22:06.121 --> 22:07.955
Well, I want to see how the whole thing

22:08.023 --> 22:09.991
Comes together, you know.

22:10.058 --> 22:13.461
That's why I really didn't
want to say anything yet.

22:16.031 --> 22:18.499
Diffuse.

22:25.707 --> 22:28.709
Okay, well, I got her favorite band.

22:28.777 --> 22:31.779
Got her favorite flowers.

22:31.847 --> 22:36.384
And got a fistful of articles about myself.

22:36.451 --> 22:38.853
Yeah, and if all that fails, just remember--

22:38.920 --> 22:41.088
Tell her to look in the
hatbox in the closet.

22:41.156 --> 22:43.124
Hatbox?

22:43.191 --> 22:45.760
Right.

22:54.536 --> 22:56.670
Can I help you?

22:56.738 --> 22:57.838
Mandy, hi.

22:57.906 --> 22:59.006
My name is allison dubois.

22:59.074 --> 23:00.708
I'm a friend of...

23:00.776 --> 23:03.344
I was a friend of jeremy's.

23:03.412 --> 23:06.881
I just want to tell you how sorry I am.

23:06.948 --> 23:08.616
Okay. Thank you.

23:08.683 --> 23:10.384
I'm sorry, he never mentioned you.

23:10.452 --> 23:12.319
Oh, no, he wouldn't have.

23:12.387 --> 23:14.488
We didn't actually meet till yesterday.

23:14.556 --> 23:17.391
I work for the district attorney's office.

23:17.459 --> 23:20.261
And I was investigating
the penny jar killer.

23:20.328 --> 23:21.896
Oh.

23:21.963 --> 23:24.532
God, you were there.

23:24.599 --> 23:26.434
Did you see it happen?

23:26.501 --> 23:29.737
I was, and I did.

23:29.805 --> 23:31.639
He wanted me to give you these.

23:31.706 --> 23:33.974
He said they're your favorite flower.

23:35.944 --> 23:38.012
He said that?

23:38.080 --> 23:42.316
After the car hit him.

23:42.384 --> 23:44.552
I didn't realize.

23:44.619 --> 23:47.154
I guess I wanted to believe
it happened quickly--

23:47.222 --> 23:48.756
That he didn't suffer.

23:48.824 --> 23:50.658
Oh, no, he didn't.

23:50.725 --> 23:52.660
It happened quickly.

23:52.727 --> 23:57.531
Um, he-he also wanted me to give you these.

23:59.501 --> 24:01.836
Sorry, what are these?

24:01.903 --> 24:07.007
Some-- some articles about me, about how I--

24:07.075 --> 24:09.143
How sometimes I see the dead.

24:09.211 --> 24:12.980
How I can communicate with the dead.

24:13.048 --> 24:15.916
Okay, this is unspeakably cruel.

24:15.984 --> 24:18.085
He thought that you might react like that.

24:18.153 --> 24:20.521
That's why he said those
are your favorite flowers,

24:20.589 --> 24:22.323
This is your favorite band...

24:22.390 --> 24:26.627
Right. Look, I have a funeral to prepare.

24:26.695 --> 24:29.530
People to call, arrangements to make.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.732
So I'm going to go back in the house now,

24:31.800 --> 24:34.201
Shut the door and ask you
to leave my property.

24:34.269 --> 24:37.571
He wants you to know that he's watching you,

24:37.639 --> 24:39.273
And that he loves you

24:39.341 --> 24:41.275
And if there's anything you
ever need to say to him,

24:41.343 --> 24:42.810
You can say it through me.

24:42.878 --> 24:44.612
Look, I hear you, but just so you know,

24:44.679 --> 24:47.648
If I have anything to say to him,
I'm going to say it to him

24:47.716 --> 24:50.151
In my own way and my own time,
thank you very much.

24:50.218 --> 24:51.986
Oh, wait, wait.

24:52.053 --> 24:54.955
The hatbox, he wants you to look
in the hatbox in the closet.

24:55.023 --> 24:57.625
He wants you to look in there...

25:04.966 --> 25:06.433
Al, what do you think?

25:06.501 --> 25:07.701
Al?

25:07.769 --> 25:11.405
Yeah, I think it, um, looks good.

25:11.473 --> 25:13.073
I think it's fine.

25:13.141 --> 25:15.376
Well, it's my performance review,

25:15.443 --> 25:17.611
So I was kind of hoping
for better than fine.

25:17.679 --> 25:18.746
You're gonna do great.

25:18.813 --> 25:20.781
Look, he's told you already

25:20.849 --> 25:22.683
That you don't have anything to worry about.

25:22.751 --> 25:25.819
Yeah, that was before I let him down

25:25.887 --> 25:28.656
By not reading his entire 90
0-page opus in one night

25:28.723 --> 25:30.658
And declaring it a work of genius.

25:30.725 --> 25:34.428
One thing has nothing to do with the other.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.830
Take it from someone who knows nothing has

25:36.898 --> 25:38.666
Anything to do with anything.

25:38.733 --> 25:40.267
Come on, al.

25:40.335 --> 25:41.835
What did you expect?

25:41.903 --> 25:43.637
The man just died.

25:43.705 --> 25:45.673
The woman just lost her boyfriend.

25:45.740 --> 25:48.342
I know, I know, I know.

25:48.410 --> 25:51.478
It's just-- he said "
you do this and I'll do that."

25:51.546 --> 25:53.581
So I did this.

25:53.648 --> 25:55.049
He just disappeared,

25:55.116 --> 25:57.184
And I haven't seen him
or heard from him since.

26:27.949 --> 26:29.149
Hello?

26:29.217 --> 26:31.452
Where am I?

26:31.519 --> 26:32.720
Anybody here?

26:37.292 --> 26:39.226
Can you help me?

26:39.294 --> 26:43.097
I don't feel well,
and I don't know where I am.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.102
Please.

26:54.843 --> 26:57.678
<i> Hey... Hey wake up.</i>

27:00.715 --> 27:02.049
Oh, good, you're awake.

27:02.117 --> 27:03.817
We need to talk.

27:03.885 --> 27:06.754
Jeremy, I didn't think I
was going to see you again.

27:06.821 --> 27:10.124
Did you do that on purpose?

27:10.191 --> 27:12.159
Did I just do what on purpose?

27:12.227 --> 27:13.794
I was having a dream,

27:13.862 --> 27:16.563
And in it I was just about to see the face

27:16.631 --> 27:18.465
Of the penny jar killer.

27:18.533 --> 27:20.467
But right before it happened,
you woke me up.

27:20.535 --> 27:23.170
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:23.238 --> 27:25.005
I had no idea.

27:25.073 --> 27:26.807
But, look, I don't think it matters.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.343
I mean, that's what I'm here for.

27:29.411 --> 27:31.145
I found out who the guy is.

27:36.001 --> 27:37.635
So he really does exist.

27:37.703 --> 27:40.037
Shane malinowski? He sure does.

27:40.105 --> 27:41.706
Soon as I punched his name into the system,

27:41.773 --> 27:42.807
The printer went into overdrive.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.542
Look at this guy's record.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.278
He's the poster child for social deviants.

27:47.346 --> 27:49.380
Like an accident waiting to happen.

27:49.448 --> 27:52.116
And you're confident this is
the man we're looking for?

27:52.184 --> 27:54.085
The late jeremy kiernan is confident.

27:54.153 --> 27:55.720
He's the one who gave me his name.

27:55.787 --> 27:59.423
And he is in a place to know.

27:59.491 --> 28:00.791
He also told me

28:00.859 --> 28:02.527
That malinowski spent his
mornings in humboldt park.

28:02.594 --> 28:04.996
That's where he scouted for his victims.

28:05.063 --> 28:07.064
Sounds like we should put
an apb out on this guy.

28:07.132 --> 28:08.266
Get some men over to humboldt park,

28:08.333 --> 28:09.400
Take a look around for him.

28:21.079 --> 28:23.247
Mandy?

28:23.315 --> 28:24.782
How did you know?

28:24.850 --> 28:26.984
Know what?

28:28.554 --> 28:30.888
It was in the hatbox.

28:30.956 --> 28:34.525
He must have been planning to propose.

28:34.593 --> 28:36.594
How does it work?

28:36.662 --> 28:38.229
Is he here, now?

28:38.297 --> 28:40.531
Please.

28:46.805 --> 28:49.907
No, no, I'm sorry, he's not.

28:49.975 --> 28:53.477
I'm sorry for the way that
I treated you yesterday.

28:53.545 --> 28:55.880
I mean, that's really
what I came here to say.

28:57.816 --> 29:00.351
I was hoping he'd be here.

29:00.419 --> 29:04.121
Hoping you could tell him about
some decisions I've made.

29:04.189 --> 29:06.357
I can do that.

29:06.425 --> 29:09.961
I've decided to leave phoenix.

29:10.028 --> 29:12.897
It's just-- it's too hard.

29:12.965 --> 29:16.734
I mean, I came here because of jeremy.

29:16.802 --> 29:19.704
And I see him everywhere.
I feel him everywhere.

29:19.771 --> 29:22.306
It's wrong to be here without him.

29:22.374 --> 29:26.444
So I have some loose ends to tie up,
house and all.

29:26.511 --> 29:29.380
But as soon as I can,
I'm going to head back east

29:29.448 --> 29:31.616
And try living with my mom for a while.

29:31.683 --> 29:34.652
I'm sure that jeremy would understand that.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.256
Yeah.

29:38.323 --> 29:44.061
When you see him-- tell him "thank you."

29:44.129 --> 29:48.332
And tell him, thanks to you,
I know what I have to do now.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.402
Tell him that I would have said "yes."

29:52.437 --> 29:55.206
I'm sure he knows that.

29:55.274 --> 29:56.807
But I will let him know.

29:58.377 --> 30:00.845
Come on in.

30:03.148 --> 30:04.915
Nothing to be afraid of.

30:04.983 --> 30:07.385
Just your run-of-th
e-mill performance review.

30:07.452 --> 30:10.254
I'm sure you've been through these before.

30:10.322 --> 30:14.725
It's kind of nice,
your supervisor being here.

30:14.793 --> 30:16.327
Taking a personal interest in your career.

30:16.395 --> 30:20.431
Here we go.

30:20.499 --> 30:22.366
Dubois. Joseph.

30:22.434 --> 30:25.303
I have to say, joe, we, uh,
we were all very excited

30:25.370 --> 30:26.904
When you came on board here.

30:26.972 --> 30:29.807
Although, according to this,

30:29.875 --> 30:33.277
You've been having some trouble adjusting.

30:33.345 --> 30:36.013
Uh, trouble adjusting?

30:36.081 --> 30:38.215
Well, I'm sorry to say,

30:38.283 --> 30:40.351
The evaluations I received
from your supervisor,

30:40.419 --> 30:44.121
Reflect, well, a certain level of
disappointment with your performance.

30:45.424 --> 30:47.358
As you can see, pretty much

30:47.426 --> 30:49.060
Straight down the line,

30:49.127 --> 30:52.129
There are issues with the clarity and focus.

30:52.197 --> 30:53.764
Excuse me?

30:53.832 --> 30:55.933
Well, let's read along here, shall we?

30:56.001 --> 30:59.870
"describe your coworker's
communication skills."

30:59.938 --> 31:02.106
And what does it say there?

31:02.174 --> 31:04.475
"diffuse."

31:04.543 --> 31:08.379
"describe your coworker's
ability to problem solve."

31:08.447 --> 31:11.615
"diffuse."

31:11.683 --> 31:13.384
"describe your..."

31:13.452 --> 31:15.219
Well, you get the idea.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.288
Yeah, yeah.

31:17.356 --> 31:19.156
I sure do.

31:44.383 --> 31:47.418
Remember that ring?

31:47.486 --> 31:52.523
I took it off the first
girl we ever did together.

31:55.093 --> 31:57.328
You loved it so much.

31:57.396 --> 32:01.098
Kept asking what happened to it.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.933
I lied.

32:03.001 --> 32:05.202
Said it probably fell off her finger

32:05.270 --> 32:07.872
When I was fighting to get her in the van.

32:11.643 --> 32:16.313
I've been saving it for
just the right moment.

32:16.381 --> 32:18.916
Guess I waited too long.

32:30.028 --> 32:32.563
That lady who came by today?

32:32.631 --> 32:33.964
She's the real deal.

32:35.667 --> 32:38.102
That's what I need you to know.

32:38.170 --> 32:41.839
That's what I need you to understand.

32:41.907 --> 32:44.475
You got to clean up our
mess and get out of town.

32:50.282 --> 32:52.383
Attagirl.

32:52.451 --> 32:54.485
You got work to do.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.067
Is it done?

33:10.135 --> 33:12.670
Can I go now, please?

33:12.737 --> 33:15.406
I know you haven't had all your fun yet.

33:15.474 --> 33:18.242
Let's be smart, huh?

33:19.544 --> 33:20.945
You know what I'm talking about.

33:21.012 --> 33:23.180
You know what you have to do.

33:23.248 --> 33:25.416
Please let me go.

33:25.484 --> 33:26.984
No!

33:28.687 --> 33:31.722
You know what you're doing.

33:37.947 --> 33:39.549
Don't waste your time.

33:40.016 --> 33:42.284
You're just going to embarrass yourself.

33:42.352 --> 33:44.019
You can't prove anything.

33:44.087 --> 33:47.990
Oh, by the way, malinowski?

33:48.058 --> 33:51.427
The guy I told you murdered all those girls?

33:51.495 --> 33:53.963
He died.

33:54.030 --> 33:56.332
Froze to death in the desert two nights ago.

33:56.399 --> 33:58.467
You might want to mention that
to the people you work for.

33:58.535 --> 34:00.336
You used me.

34:00.403 --> 34:03.405
Oh, I did what I had to do.

34:03.473 --> 34:04.640
How can you do that?

34:04.708 --> 34:07.143
How can you just sit there,
so smug, so calm?

34:07.210 --> 34:08.878
We're going to get

34:08.945 --> 34:09.978
Your girlfriend.

34:10.045 --> 34:12.081
We are not going to let her leave town.

34:12.149 --> 34:13.349
Sure you will.

34:13.416 --> 34:15.717
What can you do?

34:15.784 --> 34:18.187
That basement? It's clean now.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.222
There's no trace of anything
that happened down there.

34:20.290 --> 34:22.591
No evidence whatsoever.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.561
Oh, yeah. She'll leave town.

34:25.629 --> 34:28.429
And sure, you'll keep an eye on her

34:28.498 --> 34:30.232
For a while.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.368
Call whatever jurisdiction she ends up in.

34:32.435 --> 34:33.601
Tell them to keep an eye on her.

34:33.670 --> 34:36.539
But time goes by.

34:36.606 --> 34:38.274
There'll be other crimes.

34:38.341 --> 34:40.743
Other murders here in phoenix.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.277
And you'll forget.

34:42.344 --> 34:44.847
That's how these things go.

34:44.915 --> 34:46.282
She'll be fine.

34:46.349 --> 34:48.050
As long as she doesn't slip up.

34:48.118 --> 34:49.851
As long as she's patient.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.288
So what? She just stops?

34:52.355 --> 34:53.455
Well...

34:53.523 --> 34:56.358
I didn't say forever.

34:56.426 --> 35:00.095
I mean, when you do the things that we do,

35:00.163 --> 35:04.967
It's a tough itch to
scratch once you've got it.

35:05.035 --> 35:07.903
But, like I said, mandy,

35:07.971 --> 35:10.639
She's nothing if not patient, so...

35:10.707 --> 35:13.642
She'll wait. Wait for the right time.

35:13.710 --> 35:15.744
The right situation.

35:15.812 --> 35:17.546
A signal from me, maybe.

35:19.115 --> 35:21.517
And I'll be patient, too.

35:21.585 --> 35:22.751
Wait for her.

35:26.323 --> 35:27.856
Ain't love grand?

35:35.699 --> 35:38.701
Oh.

35:38.768 --> 35:39.935
Hi, allison.

35:40.003 --> 35:41.470
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you.

35:41.538 --> 35:44.406
But jeremy came to see me last night.

35:44.474 --> 35:46.775
He said he had one last message.

35:46.843 --> 35:48.310
Well, what did he want you to tell me?

35:48.378 --> 35:52.147
Well, it didn't really make a
lot of sense to me at the time,

35:52.215 --> 35:54.917
I mean, with you getting
ready to leave and all.

35:54.985 --> 35:57.319
But he was terribly concerned

35:57.387 --> 35:59.021
About you going through
all of this by yourself.

35:59.089 --> 36:01.657
I mean, getting ready for the funeral,

36:01.725 --> 36:04.193
And-and moving back east.

36:04.261 --> 36:05.728
He was-he was worried

36:05.795 --> 36:08.163
That you didn't have a friend
to help you through all this.

36:19.676 --> 36:21.310
Jeremy had you take this?

36:21.378 --> 36:22.978
This morning.

36:23.046 --> 36:26.915
He said that he thought the two
of you could make great friends.

36:26.983 --> 36:28.984
That she was perfect for you.

36:31.421 --> 36:33.956
I wonder what he was thinking.

36:34.024 --> 36:36.725
He said to tell you tha
t-that she jogs every morning

36:36.793 --> 36:40.596
At walker park at 7:00, 7:00 in the morning.

36:40.664 --> 36:42.564
Um, oh, and he wanted you to know

36:42.632 --> 36:45.868
That if you two do become friends,

36:45.935 --> 36:47.936
That he will be watching,

36:48.004 --> 36:49.271
That he'll see everything,

36:49.339 --> 36:51.440
And that it'll bring him a lot of pleasure

36:51.508 --> 36:54.610
To know that you're not alone.

36:56.846 --> 36:59.415
Keith?

36:59.482 --> 37:02.551
Hey, keith. Can you not hear me over there?

37:02.619 --> 37:05.621
Am I being too diffuse?

37:05.689 --> 37:07.756
What are you working on?
Is that company business

37:07.824 --> 37:09.491
Or more of your lord of
the harry potter crap?

37:09.559 --> 37:10.826
All right. This is a private office.

37:10.894 --> 37:11.994
You can't-you can't just walk--

37:12.062 --> 37:14.897
You owe me an apology.

37:14.964 --> 37:18.100
And I want you to write a
letter to human resources

37:18.168 --> 37:20.202
Saying you didn't mean any of the things

37:20.270 --> 37:21.437
That you wrote in that report.

37:21.504 --> 37:25.407
Oh, but I meant every word of it.

37:25.475 --> 37:28.444
Of course, it's fairly early
on in your employment here.

37:28.511 --> 37:30.412
I might modify my opinion in time.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.648
Just like you might modify your opinion

37:32.716 --> 37:34.583
When you finish my manuscript.

37:34.651 --> 37:37.353
When I finish your manuscript?

37:37.420 --> 37:38.787
After what you did to me? No.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.189
Are you out of your mind?

37:40.256 --> 37:42.858
No. I'm not indulging your childish behavior

37:42.926 --> 37:44.193
For one more second.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.761
That's what this is about, isn't it?

37:45.829 --> 37:47.463
That-that I'm much younger than you.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.565
Hey, you're not that much younger than me.

37:49.632 --> 37:51.800
No. I'm-I'm a lot younger than you.

37:51.868 --> 37:54.403
Well, you're certainly a lot
more childish than I am.

37:54.471 --> 37:57.005
And I think that your behavior
in that meeting yesterday,

37:57.073 --> 37:58.340
And in fact, your behavior from the second

37:58.408 --> 38:00.142
You gave me that screed of yours...

38:00.210 --> 38:01.377
Screed?

38:02.579 --> 38:04.480
You... Punk.

38:04.547 --> 38:07.049
Okay. All right.

38:07.117 --> 38:08.484
You're calling me a punk, then?

38:08.551 --> 38:10.686
Yeah, punk, I am.

38:10.754 --> 38:12.087
'cause that is what you did yesterday.

38:12.155 --> 38:13.689
That was a punk move.

38:13.757 --> 38:15.758
That was not something
that an adult would do.

38:15.825 --> 38:17.793
That is not something that a man would do.

38:17.861 --> 38:19.495
Oh. So now I'm not a man?

38:19.562 --> 38:20.963
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?

38:21.030 --> 38:22.798
'cause I was busy trying to
remember what decade it was

38:22.866 --> 38:26.168
That I last had a chocolate
milk and pb and j for lunch.

38:26.236 --> 38:28.937
All right. That's it, dubois.

38:29.005 --> 38:30.172
You want a piece of me?

38:30.240 --> 38:31.974
Careful what you wish for, punk.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.776
Come on. We'll settle this old school.

38:33.843 --> 38:34.810
Like men?

38:34.878 --> 38:37.679
Yeah, like real men.

38:39.249 --> 38:40.716
I got that!

38:40.784 --> 38:42.317
Ha! Shoot him!

38:42.385 --> 38:43.552
Take that, punk.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.020
Die, old man!

38:45.088 --> 38:47.256
Are you guys ever gonna finish?

38:47.323 --> 38:49.758
We've been waiting here an hour.

38:49.826 --> 38:53.262
Hey. Didn't your parents teach
you to respect your elders?

38:53.329 --> 38:54.630
Go away.

38:54.697 --> 38:57.099
Scat. This is serious.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.434
Come on.

39:01.504 --> 39:04.339
You all think that you're
winning here today.

39:04.407 --> 39:06.708
You think that you're punishing me.

39:08.178 --> 39:10.746
You don't know the way things really work.

39:10.814 --> 39:13.649
I am going to go see jeremy today.

39:13.716 --> 39:15.784
And that is a reward.

39:15.852 --> 39:18.821
And we're gonna laugh.

39:18.888 --> 39:21.457
At all of you.

39:21.524 --> 39:23.192
At all of this.

39:23.259 --> 39:25.160
Everything.

40:00.897 --> 40:02.898
It's done.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.976
You tried to abduct an undercover cop.

40:16.679 --> 40:18.180
Oh, my god!

40:18.248 --> 40:20.115
Jeremy!

40:20.183 --> 40:21.750
It's really you!

40:21.818 --> 40:23.619
Yeah. It's really me.

40:23.686 --> 40:26.188
I've been waiting so long to see you.

40:26.256 --> 40:29.858
Well, actually, no, you haven't.

40:29.926 --> 40:33.662
I mean, really, mandy.

40:33.730 --> 40:34.763
I thought we could have

40:34.831 --> 40:36.498
Stretched this thing out a little bit.

40:36.566 --> 40:38.967
I didn't think it was going
to end quite so fast.

40:39.035 --> 40:41.370
Are you disappointed?

40:41.437 --> 40:45.107
Well, yeah. A little bit.

40:45.174 --> 40:49.111
I mean, you did try to
abduct an undercover cop.

40:49.178 --> 40:51.513
When did you get so stupid?

40:51.581 --> 40:53.415
Hmm?

40:53.483 --> 40:54.716
Seriously, what happened?

40:54.784 --> 40:57.252
Did you become a total idiot after I died?

40:57.320 --> 41:00.055
That woman, she said she
had a message from you.

41:00.123 --> 41:01.156
Yeah, she lied.

41:01.224 --> 41:02.558
It was a trick.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.893
I can't believe you didn't
know it was a trick.

41:04.961 --> 41:08.564
I'm sorry, okay? I wanted to believe it.

41:08.631 --> 41:10.699
I wanted to believe that
you would be watching

41:10.767 --> 41:12.568
One last time.

41:12.635 --> 41:14.069
Jeremy, why are you mad?

41:14.137 --> 41:16.471
We're together now and we'll stay together.

41:16.539 --> 41:18.006
Forever. Yeah?

41:18.074 --> 41:20.175
And what are we gonna do forever, mandy?

41:20.243 --> 41:22.177
We're gonna stare at each other?

41:22.245 --> 41:23.612
Talk?

41:23.680 --> 41:26.114
I thought you liked talking to me.

41:26.182 --> 41:27.616
I thought we were perfect together.

41:27.684 --> 41:30.152
There was one thing that made
us perfect for each other.

41:30.219 --> 41:33.322
And now, thanks to you,
that one thing is gone.

41:35.291 --> 41:37.259
Thanks to me? Mm-hmm.

41:37.327 --> 41:38.827
I didn't get hit by a car

41:38.895 --> 41:41.029
Because I never learned
to leave my dope at home.

41:41.097 --> 41:43.765
Couldn't leave it at home,
'cause, as you and I both know,

41:43.833 --> 41:45.167
It wouldn't be there when I get back.

41:45.234 --> 41:47.936
One time! One time I smoked
without you. Get over it!

41:48.004 --> 41:49.338
Get over yourself.

41:49.405 --> 41:51.406
You think I don't know you
also go through my wallet?

41:51.474 --> 41:53.375
Check my email, look through my cell phone?

41:53.443 --> 41:54.643
That's 'cause you go through mine.

41:54.711 --> 41:56.011
I do not! You do, too.

41:56.079 --> 41:57.245
Do not. You lie!

41:57.313 --> 41:58.547
Who you calling a liar?

41:58.615 --> 42:00.515
You, liar! Yeah? At least I'm not an idiot.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.684
Oh, shut your face! At least I don't have--

42:07.390 --> 42:09.124
Oh, sorry.

42:09.192 --> 42:11.860
Oh, no. It's okay. I was awake already.

42:11.928 --> 42:13.261
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

42:13.329 --> 42:14.963
Did you have a bad dream?

42:15.031 --> 42:17.733
No, I had a good dream, actually.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.402
Yeah. Yeah. I think
everything's going to work out.

42:22.071 --> 42:24.172
The perfect ending

42:24.240 --> 42:26.642
To a perfect relationship.

42:28.711 --> 42:31.246
Hey. Speaking of relationships,

42:31.314 --> 42:32.648
How did it go?

42:32.715 --> 42:34.816
Who's the new "king of kong"?

42:34.884 --> 42:38.720
Who beat who? Come on.
Inquiring minds want to know.

42:38.788 --> 42:41.023
I don't know. I let him win a couple.

42:41.090 --> 42:42.758
Then he let me win a couple.

42:42.825 --> 42:45.694
And then we-we drank a bunch.

42:45.762 --> 42:48.296
And then we ordered some food and we talked.

42:48.364 --> 42:49.931
And then we drank some more.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.500
That's it?

42:51.567 --> 42:53.669
Uh-huh. No, actually.

42:53.736 --> 42:56.338
Uh, it turns out, he can belch on command.

42:56.406 --> 42:57.806
Hmm.

42:57.874 --> 43:00.709
It's very impressive.
Uh, he likes the thing I do

43:00.777 --> 43:02.577
Where the smoke comes out of my ear.

43:02.645 --> 43:06.048
It sounds like love. Yeah.

43:06.115 --> 43:08.917
So, no more animus? No more, uh, anger?

43:08.985 --> 43:11.987
No more, "my wee-wee's bigger
than your wee-wee" stuff?

43:12.055 --> 43:13.422
Please.

43:13.489 --> 43:15.123
You're talking about a couple of adults.

43:15.191 --> 43:17.559
okay.
