00:01.070 --> 00:03.870
Gordon: Previously on
season ten of "MasterChef"...

00:03.900 --> 00:05.380
Let's go, baby!

00:05.420 --> 00:08.220
Gordon: This is the best
auditions in over a decade

00:08.250 --> 00:10.110
- of this competition.
- Holy, dude.

00:10.150 --> 00:13.630
- Gordon: That was exceptional.
- Thank you, Chef.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.260
Drop the plate, man.
Let's go, Blue Team.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.740
Joe: It looks out of,
like, a food magazine.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.710
- Beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

00:19.740 --> 00:23.440
This dish, Subha, is
"Subha-doobah" good.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.610
I'm really sorry to
say, but you've cooked

00:25.650 --> 00:28.200
for the last time in
the MasterChef kitchen.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.310
- Tonight...
- Trust me when I say

00:30.340 --> 00:32.000
it's the toughest night yet.

00:32.030 --> 00:34.380
...the home cooks fight for immunity

00:34.410 --> 00:36.550
in a mystery box challenge...

00:36.590 --> 00:37.930
- Yes!
- ...with a big surprise.

00:37.970 --> 00:41.250
Please welcome Victoria's Secret icon

00:41.280 --> 00:43.970
Alessandra Ambrosio.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.490
But that's not the only surprise.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.500
Stop the clock. There's
an additional twist!

00:49.530 --> 00:51.430
I feel like I'm going to start crying.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.170 --> 01:06.480
- Make your way down please.
- Let's go, guys.

01:06.510 --> 01:08.410
- Yeah!

01:08.450 --> 01:10.140
- Yes.
- Here we go.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.690
I walk into the kitchen
today, and I'm feeling anxious

01:12.730 --> 01:14.420
because I see the big mystery box.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.520
And I'm just coming off
an elimination challenge.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.700
I do not want to be back in another one.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.940
I've been in them
all, but I've listened.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.260
So I'm hoping to use
some of those little tips

01:23.290 --> 01:25.050
that the chefs have told me

01:25.090 --> 01:26.780
and just apply them to today's cook.

01:26.810 --> 01:30.850
We are down to 17 home cooks,

01:30.880 --> 01:35.370
fighting for the top prize
of a quarter-million dollars,

01:35.410 --> 01:37.820
the gorgeous MasterChef trophy,

01:37.860 --> 01:43.550
and the title of
America's next MasterChef.

01:43.590 --> 01:47.620
Your path to winning this
incredible tenth season

01:47.660 --> 01:51.900
continues with tonight's
top secret mystery box.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.360
- Oh!
- All right.

01:54.390 --> 01:56.810
Some of you have been
flying under the radar.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.360
But you still have an opportunity
to show us what you can do

02:01.400 --> 02:03.920
in tonight's immunity challenge.

02:03.950 --> 02:07.330
Only three of you will be saved.

02:07.370 --> 02:11.230
3 out of 17, definitely not
great math in your favor,

02:11.270 --> 02:14.720
but I need to show the judges
that I'm just not all talk.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.720
I've got knife skills, I've
got the technical chops,

02:17.760 --> 02:20.380
and I should be guaranteed immunity.

02:20.420 --> 02:21.590
Aarón: I'm sure all
of you are wondering

02:21.620 --> 02:24.350
what secret ingredients are laying

02:24.390 --> 02:27.320
- under those mystery boxes.
- Yes, Chef.

02:27.350 --> 02:29.250
To introduce those ingredients,

02:29.290 --> 02:32.700
someone who knows a thing
or two about secrets.

02:32.740 --> 02:36.120
She's an actress, a loving mother,

02:36.160 --> 02:40.850
and a former Victoria's
Secret runway icon.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.960
Please give a warm welcome
to Alessandra Ambrosio.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.650
- Hey, girl!

02:50.890 --> 02:52.000
Whoo!

02:54.280 --> 02:57.040
Hi, guys.

02:57.070 --> 02:59.140
Noah: Seeing a super
model, I'm speechless.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.910
You drop an angel literally from above

03:01.940 --> 03:03.110
down in the kitchen. Get out of here.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.430
Forget about it.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.220
I mean, unbelievable.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.570
Was not seeing that coming at all.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.360
- Welcome to the MasterChef family.
- Thank you.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.540
It's an absolute
pleasure having you here.

03:12.570 --> 03:16.160
She won't be here to taste,
because she has to jet off.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.780
But she's here to
inspire you as you cook.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.580
Now, you're from Brazil,so
they're strong, bold flavors.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.650
Coming from Brazil, we
love fresh food, fishing,

03:26.690 --> 03:29.730
grabbing whatever we have,
using it that day to cook.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.900
It's all about cooking and eating,

03:31.940 --> 03:33.630
and having fun, listening to music,

03:33.660 --> 03:35.910
spending quality time with your family.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.150
Nice. Right, all of you,
it's time to find out

03:40.190 --> 03:42.290
what secret ingredientsyou'll
be cooking with tonight.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.430
Head to your stations. Let's go.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.470
Micah: I've been in every
single elimination challenge.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.020
Having the chance to get immunity

03:48.060 --> 03:49.680
is going to be everything,

03:49.710 --> 03:51.440
and I'm about to attack
this with full force.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.780
I need to have immunity.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.270
Now, tonight, Alessandra has curated

03:55.300 --> 03:58.860
the incredible ingredients
under your mystery boxes.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.520
Alessandra, please, do the honors.

04:01.550 --> 04:05.760
On the count of three,
please lift those boxes.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.770
- Oh, wow.
- Yes!

04:13.810 --> 04:16.459
- Wow.
- There you have proteins

04:16.500 --> 04:18.779
that are staples in
Latin American cuisine.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.880
You have red snapper, prawns,

04:20.920 --> 04:25.060
octopus, skirt steak, and swordfish.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.710
Wow.

04:26.750 --> 04:27.890
I'm having a panic attack.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.130
Most of these proteins

04:29.170 --> 04:30.370
I've never cooked before.

04:30.410 --> 04:31.720
I'm feeling like I'm going to struggle.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.170
I need to get it together,

04:33.200 --> 04:35.030
so that way I can conceptualize my dish.

04:35.070 --> 04:37.860
You have one hour to make us a dish

04:37.900 --> 04:42.040
featuring at least one
ofAlessandra's chosen ingredients.

04:42.070 --> 04:46.390
You will also have access to
the amazing MasterChef pantry,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.500
which we've given a
little Latino spin to.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.260
Ooh!

04:50.290 --> 04:53.670
We want to see
Latin-inspired, elegant dishes

04:53.710 --> 04:56.920
in honor of Alessandrajoining
us this evening.

04:56.950 --> 04:57.990
- Understood?
- Yes, Chef!

04:58.020 --> 04:59.020
Remember what's at stake,

04:59.060 --> 05:01.370
three amazing places upstairs.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.230
This is my first time actually
down in the kitchen cooking a dish.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.550
A few months ago I
was just back at school

05:06.580 --> 05:09.000
cooking on this smallinduction
burner in this little

05:09.030 --> 05:11.520
illegal kitchen in my Harvard
dorm room that I built.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.930
Now here I am in the
most amazing kitchen

05:13.970 --> 05:16.070
in the entire country,
which is incredible.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.280
Gordon: Right, let's have
60 minutes on the clock.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.940
Focus.

05:20.980 --> 05:24.430
Make it the best Latin-inspireddish
you've ever cooked.

05:24.460 --> 05:29.430
Your 60 minutes start...

05:29.470 --> 05:31.020
now. Let's go, guys.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.610
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.920
- Starfish.
- Peppercorns.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.930
Did anyone see the annatto?

05:40.960 --> 05:42.450
Corn.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.760
Bri: So far, I've been underestimated.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.690
My competitors think that I'm
just a cocktail server from Dallas.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.450
But this Latin-American inspired dish

05:50.490 --> 05:51.520
is right up my alley.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.320
We'll do a pepper, too.

05:53.350 --> 05:55.630
I majored in Spanish and
I'm completely fluent,

05:55.670 --> 05:59.120
so this is great chance for
me to really show the judges

05:59.150 --> 06:00.810
that I'm truly a front-runner
in this competition.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.330
I have been to Buenos Aires,

06:04.360 --> 06:07.160
eating, drinking, going to asados.

06:07.190 --> 06:08.990
So I've got extensive experience

06:09.020 --> 06:10.610
with these kind of Latin flavors.

06:10.650 --> 06:12.340
60 minutes is decades of time

06:12.370 --> 06:13.820
for me with these proteins,
so I'm totally feeling

06:13.860 --> 06:15.480
like I'm going to nail this challenge.

06:15.510 --> 06:16.890
Behind.

06:16.930 --> 06:20.070
Yeah!Show those muscles, Fred!

06:20.100 --> 06:21.760
Showing them off.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.350
Of course. Great.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.800
Right now I'm goingto be making

06:24.830 --> 06:26.350
a seared red snapper

06:26.390 --> 06:29.420
with a Mexicanvegetable confetti,

06:29.460 --> 06:31.180
creamy yucca puree.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.560
I'm completely outof
my comfort zone here,

06:32.600 --> 06:33.810
but I'm trying to goand incorporate

06:33.840 --> 06:35.840
fresh Californianflavors into it,

06:35.880 --> 06:37.290
since I am from California.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.610
- It's a warzone.
- It is a warzone.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.510
Right now I'm workingon the salsa
for the searedswordfish I'm doing.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.860
I saw the cactus,it was something
I've neverworked with before,

06:47.890 --> 06:49.650
so I'm just cooking it down now

06:49.690 --> 06:52.200
to try to get allthe
sliminess away from it.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.660
Today's a very special day.It's
my son's first birthday.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.760
I know we've all
sacrificeda lot to be here,

06:56.800 --> 06:59.760
but hopefully this dishis going to
makethe sacrifice worth it today.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.490
If I'm one of the threewho
gets immunity, that is.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.110
Alessandra, you were so kind
by curating this mystery box

07:05.150 --> 07:07.700
with all of those Latino
flavors and ingredients

07:07.740 --> 07:09.980
that really speak to your background.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.780
What would you do?Which
protein wouldyou go to first?

07:11.810 --> 07:13.850
I'll go for the skirt steak right away.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.780
- Mmm.
- A little bit of salt, put it in the grill.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.200
- Easy.
- Joe, what would you do?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.410
These red prawns look
really interesting.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.820
A quick cook time so I can
concentrate on other things.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.070
I mean, for me, I
would go to the octopus.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.140
I'd cook that in the pressure cooker

07:26.170 --> 07:27.480
with tons of aromatics.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.070
And then I'd actually sear them

07:29.100 --> 07:31.140
in a hot cast iron skillet,
and then a beautiful

07:31.170 --> 07:32.870
- red chili vinaigrette.
- Nice.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.380
- That sounds delicious.
- What would you do, Gordon?

07:34.420 --> 07:35.660
Gordon:Joe, I'd take that red snapper.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.010
I would get a beautiful light chili rub,

07:38.040 --> 07:41.150
and I would absolutely pan-sear that.

07:41.180 --> 07:45.880
Here you got to be really conscious
of using the spice, using the citrus.

07:45.910 --> 07:47.920
I know that's one of your
favorite ingredients, Alessandra.

07:47.950 --> 07:51.370
And then just making sure that
all those ingredients sing.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.890
♪ Yes

07:52.920 --> 07:55.270
- Unh!
- Guys, 10 minutes gone.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.550
15 minutes remaining.Speed
up, multitask.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.380
More importantly,get
creativewith your ingredients.

08:10.770 --> 08:13.700
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hello, Evan.

08:13.730 --> 08:16.770
- What's the plan?
- I got chipotle spiced skirt steak

08:16.810 --> 08:18.120
marinating right here.

08:18.150 --> 08:19.460
I'm going to keepthe head on the prawns

08:19.500 --> 08:21.740
because I'm a huge
fanof breaking that open,

08:21.780 --> 08:23.300
sucking the juiceout of that head.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.950
So we're going to havea
little surf and turf

08:24.990 --> 08:27.780
with a roasted corn saladand
a little salsa verde.

08:27.820 --> 08:29.720
How are you going to
cook the skirt steak?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.680
- I'm going to sear it off.
- In what?

08:31.720 --> 08:35.690
- Aquí.
- Why not a grill plate or a cast iron pan?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.070
You want to make the best dish possible,

08:37.100 --> 08:38.789
you got to use the
appropriate equipment.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.799
They retain heat better and
they also give you a better char.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.210
- This is a non-stick
pan. - The first steak

08:42.250 --> 08:43.140
I cooked you gentlemen,which
won me my apron

08:43.179 --> 08:44.770
was cooked in non-stick.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.970
Well, we didn't say it was that good.

08:47.010 --> 08:48.910
- We just...
- If it wasn't that good, I wouldn't be here.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.980
- Okay. You know what, Evan?
- Oh, wow.

08:51.010 --> 08:53.570
You don't have to bust our balls, okay?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.780
I'm here to show youwhat I can do.

08:55.810 --> 08:57.300
- I'm comfortable with these ingredients.
- Good.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.330
I use these ingredientson
a regular basis.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.680
I've cooked well over100
pounds of skirt steakin my day.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.230
Remember something.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.340
As in life, in the MasterChef kitchen,

09:06.370 --> 09:08.960
the that you dole
outwill come back at you.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.450
I definitely don't wantto eat .

09:10.480 --> 09:12.340
Evan: I know what I'm doing.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.170
I don't need the cast iron pan.

09:14.210 --> 09:15.350
I'm looking forwardto knocking this out

09:15.380 --> 09:17.380
and impressing the judges.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.260
Nick: It is a little hard to concentrate

09:33.300 --> 09:35.260
cooking in front of Alessandra.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.270
I... you know, I, uh...

09:37.300 --> 09:39.750
she's obviously this
beautiful super model,

09:39.790 --> 09:41.960
and it's hard to focus on a radish

09:42.000 --> 09:44.030
when there's a super
model standing there.

09:44.070 --> 09:46.410
But my head is down and I'm
justnot looking up, so...

09:48.590 --> 09:50.560
Here we go.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
Being that I am a child of a diplomat,

09:53.830 --> 09:55.970
I obviously have traveled extensively.

09:56.010 --> 09:58.770
In total, I've lived
in about 16 countries,

09:58.810 --> 10:01.050
eaten all these different cuisines.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.360
I've actually realized that we're a
lot more similar than we are different.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.020
- Keturah.
- Hi, Chef.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.990
You have an amazing palate.
You've traveled the world.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.820
You're very fortunate
with diplomat parents.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.400
Where would you say has been
one of the most extravagant areas

10:11.440 --> 10:12.820
that you've traveled around the world?

10:12.850 --> 10:14.610
Should I say Brazilbecause
you're in front of me?

10:16.510 --> 10:18.030
No, I did enjoy Brazil a lot.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.650
I can say...

10:22.830 --> 10:24.490
So this dish has to be exotic tonight.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.490
I'm making swordfishand
plantain croquettes

10:27.520 --> 10:29.320
with a corn and avocado salad

10:29.350 --> 10:31.670
- beneath a caipirinha dressing.
- Nice.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.320
- Have you done this before?
- I have not.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.880
- Made it up on the fly.
- Sounds really good.

10:34.910 --> 10:36.670
That's exotic. Good luck.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.340
Shari: I cook curry almost
every day for my family.

10:47.370 --> 10:49.440
Latino food? This is something

10:49.480 --> 10:52.820
that I definitely do not cook often.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.270
I'm feeling really nervous.

10:54.310 --> 10:56.350
I love this. There's
a lot going on here.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.900
- Tell us about the dish.
- There's a lot going on.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.380
Right now I'm working
cactusfor the cactus salad.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.010
I want to get ridof the spines.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.520
And what's the protein?
What are you using?

11:03.560 --> 11:04.910
I'm going to use the snapper,

11:04.940 --> 11:07.910
and I'm going to do
somecilantro-lime rice.

11:07.940 --> 11:10.290
- No curry.
- No curry. No curry.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.770
This is the first
time in the competition

11:11.810 --> 11:13.740
Shari hasn't made a curry.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.640
It's so good to see you
out of your comfort zone.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.880
- Well done and good luck.
- Yeah, good luck.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.300
- Thank you.
- That's it, girl.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.410
You've got this.

11:24.510 --> 11:26.550
- Wuta.
- What's the dish?

11:26.580 --> 11:28.270
Right now I'm doing a yucca

11:28.310 --> 11:31.100
that I'm going to tosswith some color.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.660
And then I'm going to doa
black bean and a swordfish.

11:33.690 --> 11:35.630
You going to fry that? You
going to roast the yucca?

11:35.660 --> 11:36.660
What are you going to do with it?

11:36.700 --> 11:37.940
I'm going to boil it.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.110
Here's the deal with yucca, okay?

11:39.150 --> 11:40.460
Once it's cooked and it's parboiled,

11:40.490 --> 11:41.910
it needs a little bit of love.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.910
Whether you fry, whether you roast it,

11:43.940 --> 11:46.950
boiled yucca has a very monotone
texture and flavor to it.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.090
My mom and my sister
used to make me yucca,

11:49.120 --> 11:51.160
and I hated cassava as a kid.

11:51.190 --> 11:53.680
As a vegetarian, I changed my opinions

11:53.710 --> 11:56.060
of all the flavors that I've tasted,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.890
so this is my ode to what they love,

11:58.930 --> 12:00.650
but adding some Latin flair to it.

12:00.690 --> 12:03.690
- Yucca is "yuck-uh." -
Keep with it, all right?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.550
I used to think the same thing.

12:07.870 --> 12:09.660
Wow. What an arrayof dishes out there.

12:09.690 --> 12:13.350
They're definitelytaking up
Alessandra'sLatin-inspired dishes.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.980
Keturah, she's doing the
swordfish plantain croquettes.

12:16.010 --> 12:17.770
She's going to be
grilling the swordfish.

12:17.810 --> 12:20.290
It's been marinated inside tequilas.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.530
- Tough one to pull off.
- On the flipside,

12:22.570 --> 12:25.470
over here we have Wuta.
He's making more swordfish,

12:25.500 --> 12:26.990
and he's going to make a yucca puree.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.370
- I told him, test it...
- Has he done it before?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.540
- He's never done it. That's the thing, Alessandra.
- Oh, no. That's like...

12:31.580 --> 12:33.550
- that's tricky.
- And you know cassava farofa

12:33.580 --> 12:35.000
is extremely challenging.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.930
Because it's gummy.
It becomes like glue.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.140
Never workedthis thing before.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.860
I am struggling with this.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.980
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Joe.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.700
- What are you making?
- I'm making something

12:51.740 --> 12:53.740
I've never made orI don't
think I've ever eaten.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.710
A swordfishthat will be served

12:55.740 --> 12:58.670
with a roastedsalsa roja sauce

12:58.710 --> 12:59.740
with a pineapple mango salsa.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.950
- Great.
- I'm going to bake it.

13:00.990 --> 13:01.880
I'm going to haveall my seasonings...

13:01.920 --> 13:03.300
All right, be careful,

13:03.330 --> 13:04.510
because swordfish is pretty lean.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.850
- It cooks really quickly.
- Yes.

13:05.890 --> 13:07.370
- All right, Joe.
- So in an oven,

13:07.410 --> 13:09.720
very little time. Be
careful not to cook it.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.210
When swordfish is
overcooked, it's like sawdust.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.210
Okay. The pressure is increasing.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.660
But you know what? I'm a fighter.

13:15.690 --> 13:16.830
I'm going to cook my heart out

13:16.870 --> 13:18.380
and go up to the balcony tonight.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.180
Oh!

13:22.220 --> 13:23.560
Dorian: I can't afford to

13:23.600 --> 13:25.360
get on a plane and travel,

13:25.390 --> 13:27.500
but I study places.

13:27.530 --> 13:28.840
I study flavors.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.330
So I'm familiar with Latin flavors

13:30.360 --> 13:32.260
and I'm feeling really confident

13:32.290 --> 13:33.400
about this challenge.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.060
- Gordon: Dorian?
- Yes.

13:35.090 --> 13:38.270
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing a charred octopus.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.610
I think I kind ofgot y'all to
realize thatI'm not just a baker.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.790
But I still have some
stuffto prove to myself,

13:43.820 --> 13:46.450
and I hope this dish keeps
mehere until the finale

13:46.480 --> 13:48.210
when you're giving memy
check and my trophy.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.730
I've never wona trophy before.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.620
What better trophy to
winthan this one, right?

13:51.660 --> 13:53.900
- Sounds amazing, right?
- Yeah, you're very determined.

13:53.940 --> 13:56.040
- Good luck, my lady. That sounds amazing.
- Thank you so much.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.040
- Thank you.
- 35 minutes to go!

13:58.080 --> 14:00.250
Now we're cooking.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.260
I have cooked for
this apron three times.

14:02.290 --> 14:03.430
I need a break.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.430
I mean, I love being down here,

14:04.460 --> 14:06.050
I love cooking,

14:06.090 --> 14:07.430
I love impressing the
judges every time I show up.

14:07.470 --> 14:08.780
But I'm about tired of this.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.470
I'm tired of that black apron.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.650
I want to be up there, and
I want to be comfortable.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.680
Behind you, Nick.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.900
- Mm-hmm. -
Stop the clock!

14:26.940 --> 14:30.460
All of you, look at me.

14:30.490 --> 14:33.040
Stop what you're doing.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.050
This is "MasterChef" season ten,

14:35.080 --> 14:38.330
our season of surprises.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.670
So there's an additional twist.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.640
All four of us also

14:41.670 --> 14:43.850
want to see a delicious,

14:43.880 --> 14:46.090
Latin-inspired ceviche.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.920
- Let's go!
- What?

14:49.510 --> 14:51.440
I literally want to jump
off a bridge right now.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.820
I'm sorry, what?

14:52.860 --> 14:55.170
- Let's go!
- Oh, my God.

15:03.350 --> 15:05.180
All of you, look at me.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.980
Stop what you're doing.

15:07.010 --> 15:09.940
All four of us also want to see

15:09.980 --> 15:14.150
a delicious Latin-inspired ceviche.

15:14.190 --> 15:16.570
- Let's go!
- What?

15:19.400 --> 15:22.710
I'm such a planner, and I like
to really plan out my dishes.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.510
And I thought I had the
perfect dish planned,

15:24.540 --> 15:28.100
and now I just have this
twist,so I'm freaking out.

15:28.130 --> 15:29.550
Gordon: Let's go, guys! Come on!

15:29.580 --> 15:31.550
Don't hang around that pantry. Hurry up!

15:31.590 --> 15:33.520
Aarón: Let's start making
good decisions, guys!

15:33.550 --> 15:36.110
- Gordon: Let's go!
- I'm feeling a little bit of pressure,

15:36.140 --> 15:37.700
but in the military,we
always have to adapt.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.560
I have a mango salsa
componentthat I was planning

15:40.590 --> 15:42.560
on putting on oneof my dishes anyways,

15:42.600 --> 15:44.120
so I'm just going to adapt that

15:44.150 --> 15:46.050
and turn that into my ceviche.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.980
So we added in the twist of a ceviche.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.050
- Yes.
- Alessandra, we do this sometimes

15:52.090 --> 15:53.750
because we really want
to test these guys out.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.580
Aarón: This is season ten, Alessandra.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.130
We're really looking
for the best of the best.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.060
Let's go, guys! Come on!

15:59.100 --> 16:00.550
To see how they can adapt and overcome,

16:00.580 --> 16:02.170
think quick on their feet.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.860
That's what a great chef
does on a daily basis.

16:04.890 --> 16:07.410
They want to be the best?
They have to think quick.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.590
I was already short on time,

16:14.630 --> 16:16.390
and I'm going to have to sacrifice

16:16.420 --> 16:17.740
an element or two of my dish.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.560
Gordon: 20 minutes remaining.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.050
I'm so stressed.

16:23.090 --> 16:25.360
A little overwhelmedabout the ceviche.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.540
I've never made it before.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.610
However,I used to work in Mexico,

16:28.640 --> 16:30.960
so I'm familiar withthe
Latin-American flavors.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.680
I'm here to learn,I'm here to grow,

16:32.720 --> 16:35.060
so let's see what happens.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.760
- Gordon: Let's go, guys.
- Oh, my God.

16:37.790 --> 16:41.210
Aarón: Nick, you better start thinking
about what you're doing, young man. Okay?

16:41.240 --> 16:42.930
Let's go. Use that Harvard education.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.630
- Come on.
- Being out here,

16:45.660 --> 16:47.450
it's not some small deal to me.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.630
It's what I want to do with my life.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.420
I've taken time off from school

16:51.460 --> 16:54.390
and I've kind of put everything behind

16:54.430 --> 16:57.050
and come here to chase my dream.

16:57.090 --> 16:59.230
Nick, what's going on,
mijo? How do you feel

16:59.260 --> 17:01.640
about the ceviche wrinkle
that we threw at you?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.400
- I actually loved your ceviche wrinkle.
- Cool.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.990
I cook ceviche a lotat
home in the summer.

17:07.030 --> 17:08.819
- My brothers and I catch a lot of fish.
- Yeah?

17:08.859 --> 17:12.130
- And so that's fun for me.
- What are you going to make?

17:12.170 --> 17:15.410
Brazilian cheese bread
tacoswith a grilled corn salsa

17:15.450 --> 17:18.000
and a prawn aioli.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.069
All right, you got a lot going on, Nick.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.210
- I'm very impressed.
- I want to see this batter hit the pan.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.670
Because what's going to stop
it from coming out like a crepe?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.010
Maybe he wants it like a crepe, though?

17:27.050 --> 17:28.840
Well, you know,it's a unique taco.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.260
I think it's gotthat nice kind of...

17:30.290 --> 17:32.260
I want to see it. This is the moment.

17:32.290 --> 17:35.020
This is a very bold and
big decision he's making.

17:35.050 --> 17:37.780
- I like this, though.
- Let's see it.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.640
Whatever you call it,
as long as it's a vehicle

17:39.680 --> 17:41.780
for the actual shellfish or fish.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.340
I need a little bit more
than that. A little more.

17:43.370 --> 17:45.030
- Spread it out, mijo.
- Spread it out.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.690
Spread it out a bunch, yeah.It
may not be hot enough yet.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.450
- Good luck. Looks good.
- Thank you, Chefs.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.860
I haven't been down in
this kitchen in awhile.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.490
I do have a lot to prove to the judges,

17:52.520 --> 17:55.070
but I'm going to prove
that tonight with my dishes.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.050
- What's going on, Sam?
- I'm a little in the weeds, Joe, to be completely honest.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.670
The grill isn't reallygoing
as well as I could.

18:07.710 --> 18:09.710
You want to speed this
up. You need to steam this.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.020
I also have to grill my fish.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.510
Aww, man, the grill's just...

18:12.540 --> 18:13.850
- Put some water on here.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.440
- Okay.
- Grill your fish now.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.340
If you're having issues with the heat,

18:17.370 --> 18:19.060
- let it do its thing.
- Either you steam and grill it...

18:19.100 --> 18:21.310
Put it on top of the corn.
The steam will cook it.

18:21.340 --> 18:23.170
- That's a great idea.
- Steam and grill it at the same time.

18:23.210 --> 18:25.480
- Thank you, Joe. I need that.
- Aarón: Get with it.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.040
Don't be discouraged at all.

18:28.070 --> 18:29.350
Hi, guys.How are y'all doing today?

18:29.380 --> 18:31.560
- Noah, we good?
- Hi, Noah.

18:31.590 --> 18:33.870
I know it looks like a bomb,but we
got a lot of thingsgoing on right now.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.910
I'm working right nowon a mesquite.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.700
It's more Mexican.A
little homage to Aarón.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.500
We've got an en papillote
in the oven right now.

18:40.530 --> 18:43.160
Red snapper en papillote
that's about three minutes out.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.880
And I have thisyucca cava puree.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.090
It looks a little
gummy,but the flavor's...

18:49.130 --> 18:50.580
I think it's getting there.

18:50.610 --> 18:52.200
You want to try it,you can try it.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.510
A lot of fresh herbs.You
got parsley, thyme.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.070
It's very smooth,but
it's a little gummy.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.310
I've never cooked with this.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.860
I'm a little outside my comfort zone,

18:58.900 --> 19:00.900
- but I tried it.
- It sounds super ambitious,

19:00.930 --> 19:02.380
- but that's what we love about you, Noah.
- I'm trying, man.

19:02.420 --> 19:03.940
- I'm giving it all.
- Yeah? You got this.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.320
- Alessandra: Go for it.
- Let's roll.

19:05.350 --> 19:06.840
- Good luck, Noah.
- Thank you so much.

19:06.870 --> 19:09.390
- Good luck, Noah.
- All right. I'm an idiot.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.220
Just flexed. What a moron.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.740
Ooh, those tortillas look sad.

19:12.770 --> 19:15.360
There's some sad-looking tortillas.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.540
Oof. Oof!

19:17.570 --> 19:19.740
You might want to give up on this one.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.200
- Michael.
- Hey, Michael, are you going to give up on this?

19:22.230 --> 19:23.200
- What are you doing?
- No, no. I'm going to be frying them

19:23.230 --> 19:24.340
in little strips,

19:24.370 --> 19:25.510
so I just did them freeform.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.920
- Okay.
- Oh, I got you.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.240
It doesn't matter right
nowwhat they look like.

19:28.270 --> 19:29.750
- I understand.
- What's the dish?

19:29.790 --> 19:33.380
I am doing a beautifulroadside
style grilled shrimp.

19:33.410 --> 19:35.450
What are you doing about the
little wrinkle of the ceviche?

19:35.480 --> 19:37.140
Ah! I already have
thatcooking right here.

19:37.180 --> 19:40.390
I'm doing a beautiful
orangeand kumquat ceviche

19:40.420 --> 19:43.560
- with snapper.
- Orange and kumquat ceviche with snapper.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.360
- Yeah. I love traveling.
- I like that.

19:45.390 --> 19:47.570
Me and my fiancée are
inMexico at least once a year.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.400
- I've been all over the place.
- Wonderful.

19:49.430 --> 19:50.400
There's a lot morethat I'd like to see.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.810
It's a huge, beautiful country.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.570
Actually, tomorrowI
was supposed to leave

19:53.610 --> 19:55.260
for Puerto Vallarta.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.400
But I gave up my tripto be here.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.780
- Awesome.
- So I'm going to bring the beach here on this plate.

19:59.820 --> 20:02.200
- There you go, Michael.
- Thank you so much, guys.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.790
- Hi, Renee.
- What's happening?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.380
- You are absolutely beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

20:07.410 --> 20:10.830
And I'm actually wearingone
of your signature items.

20:10.860 --> 20:13.660
- You are?
- Ladies, please.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.970
- I mean, come on.
- Tell us about the dish. What are you doing?

20:16.010 --> 20:21.670
I am making a tequila
citrussnapper and prawn.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.980
Gordon: And the little
twist with the ceviche,

20:23.010 --> 20:24.020
where are you going with that?

20:24.050 --> 20:26.470
I am making a pineapple salsa

20:26.500 --> 20:28.430
with serranos, red onions,

20:28.470 --> 20:31.820
shallots, garlic,tons
of lime and lemon juice,

20:31.850 --> 20:34.030
and just salt and pepper.Just
make it really fresh.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.680
- Alessandra: Wow. Sounds yummy.
- Sounds amazing.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.860
- Good luck. Come on, you got this.
- I'm good. Thank you.

20:38.860 --> 20:40.200
Whew!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.000
Oh, boy.

20:43.030 --> 20:45.110
Last four minutes.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.110
And Noah's running for the pantry.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.280
Thank you for that, Noah.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.760
Wow, that was fast.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.040
You ever seen a man
that big run that fast?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.290
Let's go, guys.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.110
Give these dishes some finesse.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.840
Make sure that that ceviche
is separate from your entree.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.710
Put some beauty on that plate.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.880
Three and a half minutes
to go, guys. Come on.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.710
- Come on, Nick.
- You should be putting food on the plate right away.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.470
Fred: The plating for
this dish is very delicate,

21:06.510 --> 21:08.680
and I'm not happy with the
consistency of my puree.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.370
- It's very gluey.
- Fred, come on!

21:11.410 --> 21:13.890
I know that my confidencein
this kitchen has been shaky.

21:13.930 --> 21:16.070
I'm trying to get out
of this bad headspace.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.720
But all the doubt and all of the anxiety

21:17.760 --> 21:19.520
just comes back to me right away.

21:19.550 --> 21:22.210
Now I'm just a bundle of nerves again.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.970
Keep it going, guys.
90 seconds remaining.

21:27.010 --> 21:29.150
We'll see if thiscomes together.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.880
Not so confident.

21:31.910 --> 21:35.670
You've got to start plating your entree.

21:35.710 --> 21:38.540
- Ooh!
- I got to get these... something.

21:38.570 --> 21:40.710
- I'm running out of time.
- Michael's still frying stuff.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.750
- What is he doing?
- He has nothing on his plate.

21:42.780 --> 21:45.200
- He's behind.
- One minute to go.

21:45.230 --> 21:48.000
Michael: I literally waited
until the last minute.

21:48.030 --> 21:50.170
I have to finish and get it on the plate

21:50.210 --> 21:51.690
because I need to get up on that balcony

21:51.720 --> 21:53.100
and get that immunity.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.380
- 20 seconds!
- Let's go, guys. Come on!

21:55.420 --> 21:57.140
Let's go, Michael. Move!

22:04.320 --> 22:05.950
- Aarón: Come on!
- Joe: Time to put it on the plate, guys.

22:05.980 --> 22:07.530
- This is it.
- Gordon: Come on, hurry up.

22:07.570 --> 22:09.500
- Aarón: Come on, Sam.
- Let's go, guys. Come on.

22:09.540 --> 22:12.500
Michael's still frying
stuff, guys, in the fryer.

22:12.540 --> 22:16.370
- Let's go, Michael.
- Judges: 10, 9, 8,

22:16.400 --> 22:20.580
7, 6, 5, 4,

22:20.620 --> 22:24.380
- 3, 2, 1.
- Hands in the air!

22:24.410 --> 22:28.380
- Gordon: Well done.
- Aarón: Wow!

22:28.420 --> 22:30.800
Oh, my God.

22:30.830 --> 22:32.800
I hate not getting what I imagined

22:32.830 --> 22:34.560
in my head on the plate.

22:34.590 --> 22:36.600
The ceviche was a big curveball,

22:36.630 --> 22:40.220
and I just only hope, like,
14 other people do worse.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.910
Extraordinary.Give yourselves
a roundof applause. Come on.

22:43.190 --> 22:44.950
- Good job, Liz.
- Awesome.

22:44.980 --> 22:48.400
Alessandra,you are one busy,busy lady.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.160
Always on the move.Thank
you so much for being

22:50.200 --> 22:52.060
part of the MasterChef family.

22:52.090 --> 22:54.960
Your energy elevatedyou all, right?

22:54.990 --> 22:56.620
- Noah: Absolutely.
- Yes, Chef.

22:56.650 --> 22:58.410
- Gordon: Amazing.
- Thank you, guys.

22:58.450 --> 23:00.790
I really think you
guys turned Latin flavor

23:00.830 --> 23:03.420
into something very
special in your own way.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.590
We can't wait to see you again
in this incredible kitchen.

23:05.630 --> 23:07.250
- Yes!
- Keep up the good work.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.590
- Thank you, Gordon.
- Lots of love.

23:08.630 --> 23:09.800
Thank you, darling.Good to see you.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.360
- Nice to see you, too.
- Likewise.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.630
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

23:12.670 --> 23:13.840
Ladies and gentlemen,all of you,

23:13.880 --> 23:15.670
give it up please for Alessandra.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.290
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.190
Good luck, everyone.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.650
Tonight we want to see
incredible craft on a plate

23:31.690 --> 23:34.380
inspired by Latin-American ingredients.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.690
Shall we, gents?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.520
Jamie, wow, you used everything.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.290
You guys threw some
greatingredients at us.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.870
I think I gotthe grilled octopus flavor,

23:46.910 --> 23:49.290
especially doing somethingthat
normally would take me

23:49.320 --> 23:51.710
about two and a half hours.

23:51.740 --> 23:54.230
All right, Liz, how did
you prepare the swordfish?

23:54.260 --> 23:57.300
- I actually baked it.
- Is that the way you wanted it to look?

23:57.330 --> 23:58.330
No.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.680
- Wow.
- A little taco party, huh?

24:04.720 --> 24:07.720
I was trying to dotacos three ways,

24:07.760 --> 24:11.590
and got thrown a
littlecurveball by the ceviche.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.180
- Super clean.
- Thank you.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.560
- Dorian.
- Hey, how are you?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.320
- Wow, that's a lot of food.
- It is a lot of food,

24:20.360 --> 24:22.390
but I'm a big girl.

24:22.430 --> 24:25.260
Are you happy with the amount of
citrus you put in your ceviche?

24:25.290 --> 24:29.740
I just wish that hada
little bit more juice.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.750
Wuta: This challenge was hard.

24:31.780 --> 24:36.160
I'm looking around, and I think
we all struggled with our dishes.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.720
How'd you cook the swordfish?

24:38.750 --> 24:43.690
The swordfish I marinatedin
tequila and lime zest,

24:43.720 --> 24:46.110
and then just grilled it
offwith about ten minutes left.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.520
That's the way you
wanted to do the corn?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.690
The corn didn't come
outthe way I wanted.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.770
Have you worked with cactus pear before?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.290
A little bit. I personallylike
the crunch of the seeds,

24:54.320 --> 24:56.740
so I thought I couldadd
that into that mixture

24:56.770 --> 25:00.190
to add some textureto
contrast withthe creamy puree.

25:00.220 --> 25:04.330
Was this bleeding of the
saucesan aesthetic intention?

25:06.750 --> 25:08.300
- Subha.
- Are you happy with your presentation?

25:08.330 --> 25:10.090
- Uh, not at all, Chef.
- Why not?

25:10.130 --> 25:12.720
Because last-minute,I ran out of time.

25:12.750 --> 25:15.340
- Yep. Thank you, Subha.
- Thank you.

25:17.340 --> 25:20.660
So, the ceviche,
you've left the skin on.

25:22.350 --> 25:23.970
Have you ever had
ceviche with skin on it?

25:24.010 --> 25:25.770
Nope, I have not.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.560
I've eaten ceviche a lot.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.490
I can't actually believe I
left the skin on the fish.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.220
- Amazing array.
- It's unbelievable, huh?

25:36.260 --> 25:39.780
I feel that theyall embraced the
ideaof using multiple proteins.

25:39.810 --> 25:42.230
- Gordon: Yep.
- I think that the ceviche twist was good,

25:42.260 --> 25:44.400
because I think a lot of
them really rose and excelled.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.060
- And some fundamental flaws.
- Oh, yeah.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.510
- Happy?
- Yeah.

25:48.550 --> 25:49.820
- Happy.
- We got this.

25:52.270 --> 25:55.140
There are three dishes tonight
that Joe, Aarón, and myself

25:55.170 --> 25:57.900
really want to highlight.

25:57.940 --> 26:01.590
Sam, Liz, and Fred.

26:01.630 --> 26:02.660
You three have...

26:02.700 --> 26:04.250
the worst dishes of the night.

26:04.290 --> 26:06.460
- Oh.
- Okay.

26:08.390 --> 26:10.530
You three are lucky

26:10.570 --> 26:13.850
that tonight is not elimination.

26:13.880 --> 26:18.200
Liz, we never, ever,
ever, bake swordfish.

26:18.230 --> 26:19.920
- Yes, Chef.
- Sam,

26:19.960 --> 26:23.000
that's how a 12-year-old
would plate corn.

26:23.030 --> 26:26.000
Really? It's barely grilled.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.690
That's not MasterChef-worthy.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.040
Fred...

26:30.070 --> 26:33.040
you did something
tonight with those cactus,

26:33.070 --> 26:36.700
the seeds, the slime...
what were you doing?

26:36.730 --> 26:39.290
I thought that the seeds
wouldadd a little bit of crunch.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.530
- No.
- They're not edible.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.880
- They're not edible.

26:41.910 --> 26:45.220
Gordon: We don't serve the seeds.

26:45.260 --> 26:46.810
I should've known better

26:46.850 --> 26:49.710
than to put seeds that
are inedible into my dish.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.640
I'm upset with myself,

26:51.680 --> 26:54.850
and I just feel like
I'm in a bad headspace.

26:54.890 --> 26:58.240
I know that I have to get
that self-belief back in

26:58.270 --> 26:59.830
or else I'm the next one out that door,

26:59.860 --> 27:00.960
and I can't let that happen.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.590
Now, there are several dishes

27:03.620 --> 27:06.040
we want to take a much deeper look at.

27:06.070 --> 27:09.490
Remember, three of
you will be heading up

27:09.520 --> 27:12.730
to the safety of the balcony.

27:12.770 --> 27:16.050
- Evan, please bring your dish forward.
- Attaboy.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.600
- Good job, Evan.
- Thank you, guys.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.050
Evan: I'm comfortable
with these proteins.

27:20.090 --> 27:21.500
I love Latin flavors.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.060
This is the type of stuff I love to eat

27:23.090 --> 27:24.610
and cook for my friends and family.

27:24.640 --> 27:29.580
So, I'm feeling super confident.

27:29.610 --> 27:33.270
So I had a chipotlemarinated skirt steak

27:33.310 --> 27:37.070
on top of torched corn
saladwith cojita salsa verde,

27:37.100 --> 27:38.760
with a shrimpmarinated in garlic,

27:38.800 --> 27:41.280
and a snapper ceviche.

27:41.310 --> 27:44.870
- Visually, it pops.
- It's a plate where the colors and visuals

27:44.900 --> 27:47.740
speak of the flavor, so I feel like
I can taste it by looking at it.

27:47.770 --> 27:48.810
Thank you so much.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.640
We've got the acidity. We've got
the saltiness from the cheese.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.300
And you got the cook absolutely nailed.

27:58.330 --> 28:01.370
This ceviche is also... in its balance

28:01.400 --> 28:05.100
and its sweetness is really,
really top notch, you know?

28:05.130 --> 28:07.310
- Thank you.
- I absolutely love this dish.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.140
There's so much attention to detail,

28:09.170 --> 28:11.310
from the way that you
cut the cherry tomatoes

28:11.340 --> 28:13.660
to make them uniform
to the corn kernels.

28:13.690 --> 28:16.870
I love the acidity that just
permeates this whole dish.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.490
If I had to take you
to task on something,

28:18.520 --> 28:21.040
it's that you didn't
use a cast iron pan,

28:21.080 --> 28:22.490
which would have gotten you

28:22.530 --> 28:24.940
an even better sear on that steak.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.220
Next time,do me a favor and listen.

28:27.260 --> 28:30.330
But, well done.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.740
Good work, E!

28:33.850 --> 28:36.270
Michael, bring your dish forward.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.170
Michael: I'm really proud of this dish,

28:40.200 --> 28:41.750
because I feel like
this is the first time

28:41.790 --> 28:45.170
I've been able to show,
you know, myself on a plate.

28:45.210 --> 28:47.520
I'm starting to feel
like I can follow my dream

28:47.550 --> 28:49.520
to make a career out of cooking.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.350
And I'm hoping that
these flavor combinations

28:52.390 --> 28:54.250
are something the
judges get excited about,

28:54.280 --> 28:56.420
because I need this immunity.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.430
Describe the dish, please.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.950
Today I made a grilled prawn

28:59.980 --> 29:02.950
with a passion fruitand
prickly pear salsa,

29:02.980 --> 29:06.470
with an avocado mousseand
crispy tortilla strips.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.160
- Congratulations. It looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

29:12.990 --> 29:15.130
Flavor? Delicious.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.960
It's vibrant. It's citrus-y.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.380
What it needsis a touch more
heatin the salsa underneath,

29:19.410 --> 29:22.170
- a touch more seasoning.
- Yeah.

29:22.210 --> 29:24.310
- That salt is just missing everywhere.
- Sure.

29:24.350 --> 29:27.350
Joe: It's a one-dimensional
dish without the salt.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.980
So, it looks perfect, it
could have been perfect

29:30.010 --> 29:33.320
- had you seasoned throughout.
- You got it. I hear you.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
- Thank you.
- Aarón: Thank you.

29:34.390 --> 29:36.840
- Good job.
- Thank you.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.640
- Great job, Mike!
- Good job, Michael.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.400
Shari, please bring your dish forward.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.540
- Yay!
- Shari!

29:45.580 --> 29:47.160
Good job, Shari.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.130
Walking up there, I'm feeling amazing.

29:50.170 --> 29:53.450
I showed that I can cook
more than Indian cuisine.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.070
I know it's a big risk,

29:55.100 --> 29:58.070
but I'm just hoping my dish

29:58.110 --> 30:00.180
takes me up to the balcony.

30:00.210 --> 30:01.590
Describe the dish, please.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.590
So I did a pan-fried red snapper

30:03.630 --> 30:05.460
with cilantro lime rice,

30:05.490 --> 30:07.910
salsa verde, nopales salad,

30:07.940 --> 30:09.430
and a shrimp ceviche.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.780
Mother-in-law, the
curry is off the menu!

30:11.810 --> 30:16.190
- Finally. You can do it!
- I can, I can.

30:16.230 --> 30:17.850
It looks super clean and flavorful.

30:17.890 --> 30:19.270
I think you took a big risk,

30:19.300 --> 30:20.850
especially going away from Indian foods,

30:20.890 --> 30:22.890
which are generally saucy.

30:22.920 --> 30:26.000
So I hope that you have the
seasoning and the zing behind it,

30:26.030 --> 30:28.790
because there's no sauce
to hide behind on this dish.

30:28.830 --> 30:30.790
Gents.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.040
How'd you cook the snapper?

30:32.070 --> 30:34.490
I marinated itin a little lime juice.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.940
I put some diced
shallots,some Mexican oregano,

30:37.970 --> 30:41.700
and then I justpan-fried
it in some oil.

30:43.530 --> 30:46.640
- Mmm.
- Wow. Mmm.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.510
How'd you cook the snapper?

31:01.550 --> 31:04.240
The snapper, I marinated
itin a little lime juice.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.870
I put some diced shallotsand
then some Mexican oregano,

31:07.900 --> 31:11.210
and then I justpan-fried
it in some oil.

31:12.730 --> 31:16.010
- Mmm.
- Wow. Mmm.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.950
Shari, it's super well-seasoned.

31:19.980 --> 31:24.500
Great balance of salinity and
acidity in all the preparations.

31:24.540 --> 31:27.850
The ceviche might be the
best part of the dish.

31:27.890 --> 31:30.990
It's got my whole mouth
stimulated and ready to eat more.

31:31.030 --> 31:34.170
- Almost makes the rest of the dish taste better.
- Thank you, Joe.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.790
Your nopales, for someone who
doesn't use it quite often,

31:36.830 --> 31:38.170
you did a great job with them.

31:38.210 --> 31:39.690
They're still crunchy, they're acidic.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.180
Gordon: If you turned around and told me

31:41.210 --> 31:42.620
that you'd be cooking
cactus like this tonight

31:42.660 --> 31:44.070
three weeks ago, I'd
never have believed you.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.560
So here's the fascinating
thing about you.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.180
You're out of your comfort zone,

31:47.220 --> 31:48.180
but you're actually on top of your game.

31:48.220 --> 31:49.360
Fish are cooked beautifully,

31:49.390 --> 31:50.740
but the pop is the ceviche.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.980
- It's just
mind-blowing. - Very good.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.910
You can cook outside India,let
me tell you. Great job.

31:54.950 --> 31:57.190
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.710
- Nick, let's go.
- Attaboy, Nick.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.920
- Come on, Nick.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.370
Nick: I feel fantastic.

32:07.410 --> 32:09.000
I've put a lot of thought into the dish.

32:09.030 --> 32:11.860
It's beautiful, it's
colorful, it's bold.

32:11.900 --> 32:15.210
I took a lot of risks in
making such a complex dish.

32:17.210 --> 32:18.590
Nick, describe the dish, please.

32:18.630 --> 32:20.730
Tonight, I made a
Braziliancheese bread taco

32:20.770 --> 32:23.390
with a corn salsaand
a skirt steak on top

32:23.420 --> 32:24.430
with prawn aioli.

32:24.460 --> 32:25.870
You didn't play safe.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.080
- A Brazilian cheese tortilla.
- Yeah.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.740
How difficult are theyon
a scale of one to ten?

32:29.780 --> 32:31.230
Oh, first of all, they're tempestuous.

32:31.260 --> 32:32.880
You got to get in there.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.160
The fact that you did
this is so bold, young man.

32:35.190 --> 32:39.100
- Thank you, Chef.
- The ceviche presentation is the best of the evening.

32:39.130 --> 32:41.030
It looks like a ceviche that
would come from a restaurant.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.270
- What's in there?
- I have the snapper,

32:43.310 --> 32:45.620
and then I havesome lime supremes,

32:45.650 --> 32:47.240
a little bit of mango nectar,

32:47.280 --> 32:49.000
shaved radish,and passion fruit.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.280
The ceviche is good.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.390
You went overboard on the Scotch bonnet.

32:54.420 --> 32:57.630
You really need to tone
that down, young man.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.250
What did you marinate the steak in?

32:59.290 --> 33:02.430
I wrapped itaround some
cinnamonbefore I cooked it,

33:02.460 --> 33:04.780
and then I also just
didthe classic salt, pepper,

33:04.810 --> 33:06.640
a little bit of olive oil.

33:08.810 --> 33:12.920
What you've done with that cheese
tortilla and marinated steak?

33:12.960 --> 33:16.620
- Delicious.
- Nick, this is a cool, smart,

33:16.650 --> 33:18.620
very intellectual
take on a surf and turf

33:18.650 --> 33:20.210
with the prawn aioli.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.930
I mean, really high-thinking,
great-tasting stuff.

33:23.970 --> 33:25.450
- Thanks, Chef.
- Good job. Well done.

33:25.490 --> 33:27.210
Thank you.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.280
I tried to go above and beyond

33:29.320 --> 33:30.970
what the judges were expecting.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.980
And so, seeing them actually
love the dish was amazing.

33:34.010 --> 33:35.740
It just sort of validates it more for me

33:35.770 --> 33:39.050
that I deserve to be in
the MasterChef kitchen.

33:39.090 --> 33:43.850
- Bri, please come forward.
- Yay!

33:43.880 --> 33:45.640
Bri: I'm proud of my dish.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.990
I took the curveball

33:47.030 --> 33:49.580
and I executed that to perfection.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.820
I really do think I'll
be in that top three.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.000
Describe the dish, please.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.280
I made a pan seared snapper

34:00.310 --> 34:04.320
with cilantro and coconut
foamand roasted potatoes.

34:04.350 --> 34:06.290
- You dress food beautifully.
- Thank you.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.360
It's like your hair.There's
not a hair out of place.

34:08.389 --> 34:11.260
But it's almost like you're
trying to send a message to us all

34:11.290 --> 34:13.050
to put us on a diet.

34:13.090 --> 34:15.850
We can eat whole portions,
by the way. Why so small?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.500
Well, Chef, wheneverI've
personally traveled

34:18.540 --> 34:21.159
to a superfine dining restaurant,

34:21.199 --> 34:24.130
it's many, many
tastingsthat you're doing,

34:24.170 --> 34:27.070
so it is meant to besmaller portions.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.480
Shall we? That ceviche.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.900
- What's the marinade?
- I did a mango syrup

34:32.929 --> 34:35.040
and I also didplenty of lime juice,

34:35.070 --> 34:36.489
lots of salt and pepper,

34:36.520 --> 34:40.010
micro cilantro, and mango.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.530
That ceviche is
delicious,let's get that right.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.980
- Thank you.
- On point, seasoned,

34:43.010 --> 34:45.219
fruity, exotic, everything you want.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.050
- How'd you cook the potatoes?
- I roasted them in the oven,

34:47.090 --> 34:49.540
and I tossed them witholive
oil, plenty of salt,

34:49.570 --> 34:51.920
plenty of pepper,and smoked paprika.

34:51.949 --> 34:54.580
Yeah, I think you cooked the fish
perfectly. I think there's no debating that.

34:54.610 --> 34:57.720
I just feel like this doesn't really
represent your aesthetic very well.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.750
I saw them on the Latin table,

34:59.790 --> 35:05.380
and I wanted to incorporateas many
of those Latiningredients as I can.

35:05.410 --> 35:07.690
But there's other ingredientsin
there that go way better.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.350
A chipotle roasted corn
puree under that fish

35:10.380 --> 35:12.080
would've been absolutely spot-on.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.080
Creamy, rich, spicy.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.770
But great finesse.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.360
Joe: Ceviche, one of
the best of the night.

35:17.390 --> 35:18.840
- Thank you.
- Good job.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.220
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Thank you, Chefs.

35:20.260 --> 35:22.950
It was extremely pertinent

35:22.980 --> 35:25.190
to stand out at this
stage in the competition.

35:25.230 --> 35:27.880
So it feels great to impress the judges

35:27.920 --> 35:31.440
and show that I can be a
frontrunner in this competition.

35:31.470 --> 35:32.960
The final dish.

35:32.990 --> 35:36.130
- Wuta.
- Good job.

35:36.170 --> 35:37.550
Wuta: Let's go.

35:37.580 --> 35:38.760
Wuta: For the first time ever,

35:38.790 --> 35:40.760
I feel really good about this dish.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.690
I feel like I nailed the plating,

35:42.730 --> 35:44.140
I feel like I nailed the flavors.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.350
And most importantly,

35:46.390 --> 35:49.220
I feel like I'm finally
showing the judges

35:49.250 --> 35:51.050
I'm a strong competitor

35:51.080 --> 35:52.360
and I can rise to the top.

35:52.390 --> 35:53.810
Wuta, describe the dish, please.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.810
I have a swordfish pan-seared

35:56.840 --> 35:59.950
with a mango onionand pepper salsa,

35:59.990 --> 36:03.400
with a spicy cilantroblack
beans and yucca.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.780
For ceviche,there's the blood orange,

36:05.820 --> 36:08.990
the lemon orange,tomatoes, basil,

36:09.030 --> 36:10.890
and then I havethe swordfish in there.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.620
There you have meon a plate.

36:12.650 --> 36:15.900
- Fantastic.
- Here's the big surprise about you.

36:15.930 --> 36:17.760
You're vegetarian.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.760
So who's guiding you on this,
or is it just trial by error?

36:19.800 --> 36:21.830
It's feeling...I know
when food's cooked,

36:21.870 --> 36:24.840
and I put the fish in my moutha
little bit and spit it out.

36:24.870 --> 36:25.870
It was really good.

36:47.310 --> 36:48.830
Here's the deal, Wuta.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.870
The ceviche...

36:54.320 --> 36:57.660
is bright and super tasty.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.490
Wuta, I just have to say
that if you had a restaurant,

37:00.530 --> 37:02.010
I would become your regular customer

37:02.050 --> 37:05.190
because I like your
style, and it just makes me

37:05.220 --> 37:07.430
want to come back and
reserve at Wuta's place again.

37:07.470 --> 37:09.540
- Good job.
- Thank you, Joe. Appreciate it.

37:09.570 --> 37:11.990
That's really good.The yucca, next time,

37:12.020 --> 37:13.160
to get them cooked properly,

37:13.200 --> 37:16.200
smash them and then fry them,

37:16.230 --> 37:18.860
so it's almost like huge
chips...crispy outside, crispy in.

37:18.890 --> 37:20.480
But I just love the fact

37:20.510 --> 37:22.030
that you've got unglamorous ingredients

37:22.070 --> 37:24.170
and elevated them to the major league.

37:24.210 --> 37:25.800
Were you nervous cooking
in front of Alessandra?

37:25.830 --> 37:28.070
No, for the first time,I
wasn't actually nervous.

37:28.110 --> 37:31.040
It was crazy.There was no
sweating.I felt very poised.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.220
So to get the best out of you
going forward in this competition,

37:33.250 --> 37:34.530
every night, we have to
bring in a super model.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.320
That would be great, Chef.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.500
- Well done. Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

37:38.530 --> 37:40.600
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Good job.

37:46.510 --> 37:48.510
Okay, thank you very much.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.270
We need a moment to discuss.

37:53.620 --> 37:56.200
- Tough. Six amazing dishes.
- Yeah.

37:56.240 --> 37:59.520
They all embraced the idea of the spirit
of Latin America and those flavors,

37:59.550 --> 38:02.280
the color, the citrus, the acid.

38:02.310 --> 38:03.940
Who came out of their comfort
zone the most, as well?

38:03.970 --> 38:05.320
- Yeah.
- No one played it safe out there.

38:05.350 --> 38:08.250
No. Very good. Ceviches
were a great add.

38:08.290 --> 38:11.120
Yeah, who conquered
thatlittle curveball we threw?

38:11.150 --> 38:14.840
Absolutely. I think a lot of
them really rose and excelled.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.220
Gordon: Happy?

38:16.260 --> 38:18.400
- Yeah. I think so.
- Okay.

38:22.750 --> 38:26.100
There were several great
dishes out here tonight.

38:26.130 --> 38:29.620
But, unfortunately,
there are only three spots

38:29.650 --> 38:33.410
available up on that balcony.

38:33.450 --> 38:36.420
And in this case, we
each had our own favorite.

38:36.450 --> 38:39.970
For me, this individual came
out of their comfort zone

38:40.010 --> 38:43.770
and showed us that they
were capable of rising

38:43.800 --> 38:46.150
in amongst that competition.

38:46.190 --> 38:49.020
For me, that person is...

38:51.190 --> 38:55.470
- Shari. Well done.
- Thank you. Thank you.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.540
Amazing.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.170
Shari: I'm one of the top three dishes

39:01.200 --> 39:03.440
out of 17 home cooks.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.100
I feel like I'm going to start crying.

39:05.140 --> 39:08.620
This shows I can make anything.

39:08.660 --> 39:11.970
This next home cook did an expert job

39:12.000 --> 39:14.660
of celebrating
Latin-American ingredients.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.360
My favorite dish of the night...

39:21.190 --> 39:25.160
- is Nick. Great job, young man.
- Thank you, Chef.

39:25.190 --> 39:27.020
Nick: It's an honor to have the judges

39:27.050 --> 39:29.920
single my dish out as the best dish.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.780
Let's go, young'n.

39:31.820 --> 39:35.580
Getting my spot back up on
that balcony feels fantastic.

39:35.610 --> 39:37.650
I didn't play it safe, and it paid off.

39:37.690 --> 39:39.830
That leaves me.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.660
This cook was able to put
bold flavors on the plate,

39:43.690 --> 39:45.800
really great technique, consistency,

39:45.830 --> 39:48.460
the kind of food that
really speaks to me.

39:48.490 --> 39:51.080
That cook is...

39:52.670 --> 39:54.390
- Wuta.
- Whoo!

39:54.430 --> 39:57.220
Yeah!

39:57.260 --> 39:59.160
Wuta, you have my vote!
Head up to the balcony.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.160
- Let's go, Wu!
- Good job, buddy.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.640
Thank you, guys.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.060
For the first time in
the MasterChef kitchen,

40:04.090 --> 40:06.850
I feel like I can pat
myself on the back.

40:06.890 --> 40:08.720
I've never been in the top three,

40:08.750 --> 40:10.410
so it feels really good to deliver.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.410
Evan: Well, .

40:13.450 --> 40:15.860
I definitely had one of the
bestdishes in this room today.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.380
And I should be on the
balcony, but I don't care,

40:18.420 --> 40:20.380
because I'm going to
continue to move forward

40:20.420 --> 40:22.320
and kick ass and take
names in this operation.

40:22.350 --> 40:26.150
All three of you are
now safe. Well done.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.530
- Thank you.
- Joe: Good job.

40:27.560 --> 40:28.530
- Thank you, Chef.
- Gordon: Good job.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.840
Good job, guys.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.220
But for those of you still down here...

40:34.470 --> 40:37.750
you know what comes next.

40:37.780 --> 40:41.370
That's right, an elimination
challenge tomorrow.

40:41.400 --> 40:45.410
Trust me when I say it's definitely

40:45.440 --> 40:48.450
the toughest one yet.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.760
All of you,

40:53.800 --> 40:56.420
sweet dreams.

40:57.305 --> 41:03.280
