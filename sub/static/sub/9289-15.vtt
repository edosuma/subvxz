00:13.995 --> 00:16.831
- Tony, got a second?
- What is it?

00:16.915 --> 00:19.916
I think it's time I stepped down.
Here you go.

00:20.001 --> 00:21.033
What's this?

00:21.128 --> 00:26.169
Access codes to CTU and Division.
You're the new CTU director, Tony.

00:26.258 --> 00:29.674
Let me out of here right now.
I know the bomb didn't go off.

00:29.761 --> 00:33.130
- I just wanted some company.
- Then what are you doing out here?

00:33.223 --> 00:36.177
- This is where I belong.
- I don't.

00:36.268 --> 00:40.348
Here. Take it. There's cougars out there.

00:40.439 --> 00:43.475
If you see one, fire a shot in the air
and it'll take off.

00:43.567 --> 00:47.232
Roger Stanton confesses that
he's known about the bomb for weeks.

00:47.320 --> 00:52.825
You have to trust me, David. Your presidency
is in jeopardy. Let me help you.

00:52.909 --> 00:55.317
No. You'll leave now.

00:55.412 --> 00:56.992
If you resist in any way,

00:57.192 --> 01:00.288
I'll have no choice but to
place you under arrest.

01:00.375 --> 01:04.455
- You gotta give me your badge, Kate.
- No. I don't believe you'd shoot me.

01:07.299 --> 01:10.335
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb?

01:10.427 --> 01:14.010
You can go to hell, you bastard.
I'm not telling you anything.

01:14.097 --> 01:16.725
Why do you want me and my
team to leave here so fast?

01:16.925 --> 01:18.593
The bomb's still here, isn't it?

01:18.685 --> 01:22.517
Initiate a grid search
on every outbuilding at the airport,

01:22.606 --> 01:24.978
starting at the north end, headed south.

01:25.066 --> 01:27.818
The bomb is on site.
I repeat: the bomb is on site.

01:27.903 --> 01:31.106
- It's armed.
- How much time have we got?

01:31.198 --> 01:34.317
I can't tell. It could be any second.

01:45.629 --> 01:48.416
Let everyone know
we'll be working in hangar 12.

01:48.507 --> 01:52.041
We're on standby here.
Anything you need, Agent Bauer.

01:52.135 --> 01:53.677
Copy that.

01:53.762 --> 01:55.838
Right here should be fine.

02:00.811 --> 02:02.887
I need a relay here.

02:04.397 --> 02:07.601
Let me get a look at the circuit panel.

02:10.112 --> 02:14.738
They redirected the circuit. Bypass ready.

02:15.826 --> 02:19.693
- Easy, easy.
- I got it, I got it. Go ahead.

02:19.788 --> 02:22.279
Let's check out that timer switch.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.204
Hang on. Adjust the flash cap.

02:27.838 --> 02:30.625
It's a little tight. Almost there.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.504
- Got it. How's that?
- Wait.

02:39.224 --> 02:41.300
Cap it off.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.143
I need the bypass.

02:49.526 --> 02:52.729
- It worked. We're in good shape.
- Good.

03:03.582 --> 03:05.740
George? What are you doing here?

03:06.501 --> 03:08.055
This is what killed me, Jack.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.835
I'd like to be here when
they lay it to rest.

03:09.921 --> 03:12.044
Got it diffused yet?

03:12.132 --> 03:15.548
- Not yet. They're looking at ten minutes.
- Is there a timer?

03:15.635 --> 03:19.218
- They haven't been able to read it.
- It could detonate any minute?

03:19.306 --> 03:22.011
George, they've got it under control.

03:22.100 --> 03:25.386
There's gotta be
somewhere else you'd rather be.

03:25.479 --> 03:31.564
I promised myself I would see this through
to the end. That's what I'm gonna do.

03:37.365 --> 03:40.651
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'll just take something.

03:44.372 --> 03:46.246
Damn it.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.915
Just give me a minute, OK?

04:00.055 --> 04:04.931
- Is there a problem?
- The trigger's tamper-proofed.

04:05.018 --> 04:08.268
I should've seen it, but it was disguised.

04:09.356 --> 04:15.608
If it's dismantled or disconnected
from the main casing, it'll detonate.

04:17.029 --> 04:20.862
Are you telling me that
there is no way to disarm this bomb?

04:20.951 --> 04:23.442
That's what I'm telling you.

04:24.913 --> 04:26.989
Goodrich.

04:29.793 --> 04:32.877
They can't diffuse it.
We'll have to fly it out.

04:32.963 --> 04:34.981
I know this airport doesn't
accommodate jets,

04:35.051 --> 04:39.546
so I need you to find me the fastest plane
you can but it's got to be reliable.

04:39.636 --> 04:42.970
There's a Cessna Caravan
in front of hangar three.

04:43.056 --> 04:45.179
She's rock solid, cruises at 210.

04:45.267 --> 04:47.674
Get it.

04:55.402 --> 04:56.647
Northwest Regional?

04:56.736 --> 05:02.691
This is Jack Bauer. I need to speak
with the president. It's urgent. Thank you.

05:05.203 --> 05:08.121
- Did you get a look at the timer?
- Yeah.

05:08.206 --> 05:12.915
- How much time have we got?
- 55 minutes.

06:02.010 --> 06:04.168
Need a ride?

06:06.640 --> 06:09.973
- Where are you going?
- Where are you trying to get to?

06:10.060 --> 06:13.345
- San Jose.
- No kidding. That's right where I'm headed.

06:13.438 --> 06:17.139
Santa Clara, actually.
It's just a few minutes past San Jose.

06:22.948 --> 06:27.028
- Know what? That's OK. I'm fine, thanks.
- Don't be scared.

06:27.911 --> 06:30.580
- I'm not.
- Then get in.

06:30.664 --> 06:34.282
- No point wandering around in the night.
- I'll be fine.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.582
One second you need a ride, next you don't.

06:36.670 --> 06:40.370
I'm sorry. It's nice that you pulled over.
It's just that...

06:40.465 --> 06:43.751
Get back in the car now.

06:48.306 --> 06:51.640
You don't know how to use that thing.

06:51.726 --> 06:54.644
Get back in the car and keep driving.

07:02.779 --> 07:04.855
Bitch!

07:13.373 --> 07:17.620
- Sir, when will you have a decision?
- When will the plane be ready?

07:17.711 --> 07:20.996
- Ten minutes.
- I'll get back to you before then.

07:21.089 --> 07:24.754
In the meantime, prepare for
the two possibilities we discussed.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.844
- And coordinate with the FAA.
- Yes, sir.

07:27.929 --> 07:32.638
I want maps and charts for both scenarios.
Pacific Ocean here, desert here.

07:32.726 --> 07:34.054
We're ready to assemble.

07:34.254 --> 07:37.020
I'll get back to you when
we have a final decision.

07:37.105 --> 07:38.220
Yes, sir.

07:39.232 --> 07:42.186
I wish I had more faith
in the reliability...

07:42.277 --> 07:44.649
- Best you can, Mike.
- Yes, sir.

07:44.738 --> 07:48.154
I'll discuss consequences
of detonation in the Pacific Ocean.

07:48.241 --> 07:50.530
Lynne will do the same
for the Mojave Desert.

07:50.619 --> 07:54.663
In the time available, the plane
can get roughly 80 miles offshore.

07:54.748 --> 07:58.911
If it splashes down just before detonation,
the bomb will go off underwater.

07:59.002 --> 08:01.789
The ocean will absorb
a large portion of the radiation.

08:01.880 --> 08:06.838
However, prevailing winds
would blow a moderate level of fallout

08:06.927 --> 08:09.548
back over the city of Los Angeles.

08:09.638 --> 08:15.059
Over time, there would be a high incidence of
cancer and other radiation-related diseases.

08:15.143 --> 08:18.927
- But there'll be no immediate casualty.
- We can't be certain.

08:19.022 --> 08:23.150
The shipping lanes into the port
of Los Angeles are extremely busy.

08:23.235 --> 08:25.607
In the 80 square miles off the coast of LA,

08:25.695 --> 08:29.942
the Coast Guard counts two dozen freighters
flying flags from around the world,

08:30.033 --> 08:34.446
plus an unknown number
of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels.

08:34.538 --> 08:38.914
It's likely that one or more of them
would be sunk or capsized by the blast.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.289
What's the impact on the environment?

08:41.378 --> 08:45.921
The blast will wipe out
a substantial pocket of biodiversity.

08:46.007 --> 08:50.420
Keystone species would be exterminated,
the food chain would be contaminated,

08:50.512 --> 08:54.212
and the regional ecological
infrastructure would collapse.

08:54.307 --> 08:58.850
Marine resources such as
offshore drilling, commercial fishing,

08:58.937 --> 09:05.390
even recreational beach usage would become
hazardous or impossible for many years.

09:05.485 --> 09:10.646
The ecological and economic effects,
Mr President, would be devastating.

09:10.740 --> 09:15.201
- What about the desert?
- We can designate a ground zero.

09:15.287 --> 09:19.035
It's isolated, so inhabited areas
won't be immediately affected.

09:19.124 --> 09:24.711
Towns could be evacuated within hours
without any serious long-term effects.

09:24.796 --> 09:28.664
We can't rule out the possibility
of isolated campers and hikers,

09:28.759 --> 09:32.293
who would be killed
or contaminated by the blast.

09:32.387 --> 09:36.052
If the wind shifts substantially
during the next few hours,

09:36.141 --> 09:38.762
it could blow fallout over Las Vegas.

09:38.852 --> 09:44.392
The best meteorological projections indicate
that that is a very, very slight possibility.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.724
Long-term effects?

09:46.818 --> 09:53.070
An area of a few square miles around ground
zero would be highly radioactive for decades,

09:53.158 --> 09:58.614
but the truth is we don't get food or any
significant resources from the desert anyway.

09:58.705 --> 10:02.750
So the overall health risk
is relatively small.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.828
Sounds like the desert's our best option.

10:07.923 --> 10:13.297
Yes, sir, we do agree with that.
But there is one more thing.

10:13.386 --> 10:16.720
In the desert, ground zero
has to be a precise location.

10:16.807 --> 10:20.010
A depression, below sea level
and surrounded by mountains,

10:20.102 --> 10:22.806
so it could hopefully contain the fallout.

10:22.896 --> 10:26.431
Potential target sites
are being researched as we speak.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.176
All right.

10:27.276 --> 10:31.233
Point is, Mr President,
the airplane isn't a military craft.

10:31.321 --> 10:36.197
It doesn't have any of the equipment
needed to deliver a payload accurately.

10:36.284 --> 10:42.536
To ensure the necessary level of precision,
a pilot will have to go down with the plane.

10:42.624 --> 10:48.128
- It's a suicide mission.
- Why can't we push it out the side door?

10:48.213 --> 10:50.786
It's too imprecise, sir.

10:50.882 --> 10:56.387
If the pilot is flying low enough to ensure
accuracy, he would be killed by the blast.

10:56.471 --> 11:03.185
One man dies, Mr President,
to ensure the safety of millions.

11:11.486 --> 11:13.645
- Jack?
- Mr President?

11:13.738 --> 11:15.861
- The desert.
- Yes, sir.

11:15.949 --> 11:18.950
Jack, my people tell me
that the pilot has to die.

11:19.035 --> 11:24.077
CTU came to the same conclusion. The bomb
has to be put down on specific coordinates.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.538
I'm sorry, but there isn't another way.

11:26.626 --> 11:28.999
Do we know who the pilot will be?

11:29.838 --> 11:33.538
We have a few volunteers, sir.
All of them good men.

11:33.633 --> 11:39.469
Whoever it is, tell him he has the undying
gratitude of every citizen of this country.

11:40.807 --> 11:45.516
And tell him we will take care
of whatever family he leaves behind.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.723
- Yes, sir. I will.
- I'll be standing by, Jack.

11:48.815 --> 11:52.599
- Call me back when the plane's in the air.
- Yes, Mr President.

11:59.117 --> 12:03.863
Funny, I don't see any volunteers.
When was the last time you flew a plane?

12:03.955 --> 12:06.529
I can get it in the air
and put it down, George.

12:06.625 --> 12:12.497
So can I. I'm current, I'm instrument-rated,
and I'm gonna be dead by the end of the day.

12:12.589 --> 12:17.215
- Problem is, you could be dead any minute.
- I can hang on for another half-hour.

12:17.302 --> 12:22.178
If you blacked out and it went down before
it got to the desert, a lot of people will die.

12:22.265 --> 12:25.966
- Come on, Jack.
- I know what you're trying to do.

12:26.061 --> 12:30.189
But I gotta say no. Agent Goodrich,
this is Bauer. They chose the desert.

12:30.273 --> 12:34.271
I want you to clear air space
and start immediate evacuation now.

12:34.361 --> 12:38.738
Gentlemen! Load this bomb. We are a go!

13:01.096 --> 13:05.473
- It's not rated as a priority.
- I don't care. Just do it, all right?

13:05.559 --> 13:07.350
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

13:07.436 --> 13:11.682
All right, Mr Auda. Wait here a second.
We'll be right with you.

13:14.151 --> 13:17.187
- Agent Graves.
- Tony Almeida. We've been expecting you.

13:17.279 --> 13:21.193
- They told you what's in the case?
- Personal effects from Ali's safe house?

13:21.283 --> 13:22.777
Who's he?

13:22.868 --> 13:27.115
His name is Yusuf Auda.
His government assigned him as a liaison.

13:27.205 --> 13:32.448
They gave us information that got us in the
safe house. We couldn't refuse to bring him.

13:32.544 --> 13:36.458
- Do you trust him?
- Right now? I don't trust anyone.

13:36.548 --> 13:40.676
Yeah. Take the case and bring it into
that conference room around the corner.

13:40.761 --> 13:42.468
- OK.
- Thank you.

13:42.554 --> 13:46.718
- Tony Almeida, Director of CTU. Welcome.
- Thank you.

13:46.808 --> 13:50.391
Must have had some trip.
You were 10,000 miles away this morning.

13:50.479 --> 13:52.471
I'm ready to get back to work.

13:52.564 --> 13:57.807
I understand analysis needs to be done
on things seized from Syed Ali's apartment.

13:57.903 --> 14:02.232
Yeah. Our lab needs to do
some preliminary work first.

14:02.324 --> 14:07.449
I'll have somebody get you coffee.
I'll be with you in a moment, OK? Thank you.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.994
The lab is ready for decryption.

14:15.086 --> 14:20.211
Good. Look, I might need somebody
to do a little handholding here.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.672
That man's name over there is Yusuf Auda.

14:22.761 --> 14:27.339
Officially, he's a visiting intelligence
agent entitled to full cooperation.

14:27.432 --> 14:31.679
Unofficially, I don't want him to see
anything he doesn't need to see.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.261
Make sure anybody you assign understands.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.894
- Sure.
- OK.

14:38.026 --> 14:43.531
I'm gonna deal with this Mr Auda myself.
If you need any help, call Jacobs.

14:43.615 --> 14:47.944
- Tony told you to assign someone to Auda.
- I'm assigning myself.

14:48.036 --> 14:51.571
You're still not comfortable
working with me, are you?

14:51.665 --> 14:54.535
Just do your job, Carrie.

15:02.384 --> 15:03.648
So, what have we got?

15:03.848 --> 15:06.678
Most of it's pretty innocuous.
There is one thing.

15:06.763 --> 15:11.259
This was well-concealed.
Obviously it was of great importance to Ali.

15:11.351 --> 15:16.143
We tried to read it, but it's encrypted.
We don't have that technology in the field.

15:16.231 --> 15:20.608
OK. I'll get our people on it right away,
see what they can find.

15:20.694 --> 15:22.770
- OK.
- Thanks.

15:22.863 --> 15:25.567
Sure.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.832
- Almeida.
- Tony, have you found Kim yet?

15:33.915 --> 15:37.534
- No. We're still working on it.
- I'm running out of time.

15:37.627 --> 15:40.549
I understand, but we got
our hands full here.

15:40.749 --> 15:42.337
If you could wait until
the plane takes off...

15:42.537 --> 15:45.544
- Tony, I'm flying it.
- What?!

15:45.635 --> 15:48.886
I'd like to speak with my daughter
while I still got time.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.344
There's gotta be somebody else to fly it.

15:51.433 --> 15:54.469
Somebody that doesn't have a family
or at least no kids.

15:54.561 --> 15:58.179
I didn't have time to take a census.
I can't order anyone to do this.

15:58.273 --> 16:00.681
Please, Tony, you've gotta find her.

16:04.738 --> 16:07.229
- I'll find her.
- Tony, one other thing.

16:07.324 --> 16:08.866
Yeah?

16:09.785 --> 16:12.026
In my apartment, there's a safe.

16:12.120 --> 16:16.912
Inside is my will and a letter I wrote to Kim
in case something ever happened to me.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.076
I'll make sure she gets it, Jack.

16:20.462 --> 16:24.329
- Thanks.
- I'll get back to you.

16:50.867 --> 16:54.782
- You all right, honey?
- I could use a lift.

16:54.871 --> 16:57.872
What are you doing way out here?

16:59.126 --> 17:05.294
I was on a date and we parked.
He got a little out of hand, so I got out.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.666
Hop in.

17:21.897 --> 17:25.184
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.815
Where would you like to go?

17:27.904 --> 17:30.905
I have an aunt in San Jose.

17:30.991 --> 17:36.614
You were on a date, it didn't work out,
so you're going to your aunt's in San Jose.

17:36.705 --> 17:40.572
Honey, your business is your business,
but I'm not an idiot, OK?

17:40.667 --> 17:45.984
I know.
It's just been crazy, and it's a long story,

17:46.084 --> 17:48.212
and I'm kind of in a little bit of trouble.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.918
If you have a cellphone,
I actually really need to make a call.

17:52.012 --> 17:55.048
- To whom?
- My father.

18:03.648 --> 18:07.432
We synchronised this
with the timer on the bomb.

18:07.527 --> 18:09.650
Thank you.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.045
Good luck.

18:34.679 --> 18:37.633
So the plane has some
automatic pilot thing?

18:37.724 --> 18:41.936
Actually, no. It'll have to be flown out
to a very precise location.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.641
So the pilot...

18:46.525 --> 18:49.810
Oh, my God. Who's it gonna be?

18:49.903 --> 18:52.228
Jack Bauer.

19:01.998 --> 19:04.074
Jack!

19:04.835 --> 19:08.168
I'm sorry, Miss Warner,
but you're gonna have to stay here.

19:36.658 --> 19:39.742
Cessna 47 Fox requesting immediate takeoff.

19:39.828 --> 19:45.664
- 47 Fox, you're clear on runway three.
- Roger that, tower. Thank you.

20:28.376 --> 20:31.745
Here's your preliminary draft
for your statement tomorrow.

20:31.838 --> 20:36.216
- Yes. Right. Thank you.
- How's the plane doing, Mike?

20:36.301 --> 20:39.752
- It's at 3,000 feet and climbing.
- Out of the city yet?

20:39.846 --> 20:46.098
It's too soon for that, but they'll clear
the main population centres in ten minutes.

20:46.186 --> 20:49.021
This is a good start,
but I want to go over it again.

20:49.106 --> 20:54.562
Call Davis. I want him to get
Air Force One ready as soon as possible.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.440
Sir?

20:57.531 --> 21:01.528
- Do you mind if I ask where you're going?
- Los Angeles.

21:02.577 --> 21:09.541
Mr President, if I may speak frankly,
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

21:09.626 --> 21:13.493
It may be a little too "hands-on",
for lack of a better term.

21:13.588 --> 21:18.215
The people want to feel that you're
managing events, not caught up in them.

21:18.301 --> 21:23.177
And, in any case, I doubt if
the Secret Service will even hear of it.

21:23.265 --> 21:26.384
Secret Service works for me.
I don't work for them.

21:26.476 --> 21:28.967
Mr President.

21:31.273 --> 21:33.811
Sir, I do agree with Mike.

21:33.900 --> 21:39.191
Once word gets out that this bomb has
gone off, there's bound to be civil unrest.

21:39.281 --> 21:41.985
I don't think you should
be associated with that.

21:42.075 --> 21:45.112
The whole country
will be traumatised by this bomb,

21:45.203 --> 21:47.492
especially the people in Los Angeles.

21:47.581 --> 21:51.530
I'm gonna reassure them that
everything is under control. Understood?

21:51.626 --> 21:54.461
Yes, sir. I'll call Davis immediately.

21:54.546 --> 21:58.294
Thank you. We'll leave for the airport now.

21:59.092 --> 22:03.090
Mike, who ended up flying the plane?
Did you get a name?

22:04.556 --> 22:07.557
Yes, sir.

22:07.642 --> 22:09.718
Jack Bauer.

22:11.229 --> 22:16.271
I'd have told you sooner, but I figured
you had enough on your mind already.

22:30.457 --> 22:34.371
Cessna 47 Fox,
climb to 10,000 feet, 0-8-niner.

22:34.461 --> 22:37.497
Roger. 0-8-niner. 10,000 feet.

22:37.589 --> 22:40.045
Expect final vectors in five minutes.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.877
I copy.

22:45.180 --> 22:50.720
Agent Bauer, I've got Tony Almeida. I'm
patching him through. Hold on one second.

22:50.811 --> 22:53.811
- Jack, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

22:53.897 --> 22:57.064
We found Kim. She's on the other line.

22:57.150 --> 23:00.400
Thank you, Tony. Good work.
Have you told her anything?

23:00.487 --> 23:03.571
No. I didn't know if you'd want me to.

23:04.658 --> 23:07.149
OK.

23:07.244 --> 23:10.826
- Put her through, will ya?
- All right.

23:11.498 --> 23:15.448
- Kim?
- Dad! Finally. Oh, my God, are you OK?

23:15.544 --> 23:19.791
- I'm OK, sweetheart. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

23:19.881 --> 23:23.001
Thank God.
You've had a hell of a day, haven't you?

23:23.093 --> 23:28.467
- Yeah. What's that noise? Where are you?
- I'm in a plane.

23:28.557 --> 23:31.130
A plane? Why?

23:31.226 --> 23:32.939
There's something I've gotta tell you.

23:33.027 --> 23:37.893
It'll be hard to hear,
so I need you to stick with me.

23:38.567 --> 23:44.439
We found the bomb. It was wired in a way
that made it impossible to diffuse it.

23:44.531 --> 23:50.118
We needed someone to fly it over the desert,
so when it exploded nobody would get killed.

23:50.203 --> 23:52.777
That someone turned out to be me.

23:58.086 --> 24:01.087
How are you getting off the plane?

24:05.802 --> 24:08.174
I'm not, sweetheart.

24:08.263 --> 24:12.676
The bomb has to be dropped in a very
specific area. There was no other choice.

24:12.768 --> 24:14.974
I'm sorry.

24:17.481 --> 24:20.102
But... Dad?

24:23.445 --> 24:27.395
- Dad, no! No, you can't do this to me!
- Kim.

24:27.491 --> 24:31.619
- There has to be somebody else!
- I didn't have any other choice.

24:31.703 --> 24:35.997
- Kim, I need you to listen to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:36.082 --> 24:41.504
- Sweetheart, what are you sorry for?
- Oh, God, everything.

24:41.588 --> 24:45.716
I've been so mean and so bad to you.

24:45.801 --> 24:52.053
Honey, anything that ever happened
between us... it was never your fault.

24:53.433 --> 24:55.309
I love you just the way you are.

24:55.509 --> 24:58.558
I don't ever want you to change,
you understand that?

24:58.647 --> 25:01.813
I love you more than anything in the world.

25:06.446 --> 25:08.688
Kim, can you still hear me?

25:08.782 --> 25:11.107
Yes.

25:12.285 --> 25:16.034
Honey, I want you to live your life.
I want you to be happy.

25:16.123 --> 25:19.159
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.290
I want you to try and grow up
and be the kind of person

25:23.380 --> 25:28.421
that would have made your mom proud, OK?

25:28.510 --> 25:30.716
Oh, God.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.255
Promise me that.

25:35.559 --> 25:38.263
I promise.

25:43.775 --> 25:49.529
Honey, I've gotta start focusing on what
I'm doing up here. I'm running out of time.

25:49.614 --> 25:52.319
I'm gonna have to say goodbye.

25:53.952 --> 25:58.116
I love you more than anything in the world
and I will always be with you, OK?

25:58.206 --> 26:00.282
Remember that.

26:02.252 --> 26:07.958
I'm proud of you... and I love you.

26:12.429 --> 26:15.964
- I love you, too, sweetheart.
- No.

26:17.017 --> 26:19.508
Goodbye.

26:46.046 --> 26:49.746
I'm sorry, honey. What do you want to do?

26:51.551 --> 26:54.256
- I gotta get out of here.
- What do you mean? Why?

26:54.346 --> 26:57.631
I was supposed to get out of LA,
but it doesn't matter any more.

26:57.724 --> 27:01.971
No, wait a minute. This is crazy.
Wait. Just wait. Call someone else.

27:02.062 --> 27:04.683
I can't. I'm OK. I need to be alone.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.279
You OK?

27:22.582 --> 27:24.658
We found Kim.

27:24.751 --> 27:28.879
- Jack get a chance to say goodbye?
- Yeah.

27:28.964 --> 27:31.040
So what'd you find?

27:31.133 --> 27:33.588
We decrypted Ali's hard drive.

27:33.677 --> 27:37.888
It's a recording of conversation
that took place four months ago.

27:37.973 --> 27:40.546
Conversation between who?

27:40.642 --> 27:47.392
Syed Ali and high-ranking government
officials from these three countries.

27:54.698 --> 27:58.742
What we're saying is that these three
countries not only knew about the bomb,

27:58.827 --> 28:01.662
but they bought it
and supplied it to Syed Ali?

28:01.746 --> 28:06.705
- Yeah. That's what it looks like.
- How sure are we about this translation?

28:06.793 --> 28:13.247
We were rushed, it needs to be refined,
but the substance of it is accurate.

28:15.010 --> 28:18.628
We'll need voice authentication
on all four of these men.

28:18.722 --> 28:23.799
- I've already got people working on it.
- Get Division involved as well.

28:29.024 --> 28:32.190
- Northwest Regional?
- Tony Almeida at CTU.

28:32.277 --> 28:35.728
I need to speak to the president
about today's terrorist attack.

28:35.822 --> 28:37.898
I'll transfer you.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.167
What is it, Mr Almeida?

28:48.251 --> 28:52.249
We have a recording of Syed Ali
collaborating with high-ranking officials

28:52.339 --> 28:56.633
from three Middle Eastern countries
in preparation for today's attack.

28:56.718 --> 29:01.047
- When did this come to our attention?
- Just within the last few minutes.

29:01.139 --> 29:04.555
- Who else knows?
- Our Division headquarters, sir.

29:04.643 --> 29:08.308
They have ties to the other agencies,
which means everybody knows.

29:08.396 --> 29:11.433
I tagged it with a
section-four security, sir.

29:11.525 --> 29:16.946
But I did think it was important to get
going on the authentication process quickly.

29:17.030 --> 29:20.529
- How long will that be?
- We should have confirmation in an hour.

29:20.617 --> 29:24.200
Let me ask you another question, Mr Almeida.

29:24.287 --> 29:28.071
Why would Syed Ali record
a conversation like this in the first place?

29:28.166 --> 29:32.662
Half the time these people don't trust
each other any more than they trust us.

29:32.754 --> 29:36.170
My guess is Ali wanted
some ammunition to protect himself,

29:36.258 --> 29:40.172
in case any of these three countries
ever turned against him.

29:40.262 --> 29:41.044
All right.

29:41.138 --> 29:45.846
Thank you, Mr Almeida.
I'll let you get back to work. Good job.

29:45.934 --> 29:48.805
Please pass on my appreciation
to your staff.

29:48.895 --> 29:51.813
- Thank you, Mr President.
- Thank you.

29:54.568 --> 29:58.352
Three governments in the Middle East
may be behind this bomb.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.605
Yes, sir. I gathered that.

30:09.666 --> 30:12.204
We could be at war soon, Mike.

30:14.296 --> 30:21.627
And once it begins... there's no guarantee
it'll be limited to these three countries.

30:26.600 --> 30:31.677
I've been thinking all day about something
Lincoln said during the Civil War.

30:31.772 --> 30:34.856
"I don't claim to have controlled events

30:34.941 --> 30:39.603
but confess plainly
that events have controlled me."

30:42.157 --> 30:45.857
It's bad enough that someone tried
to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here.

30:45.952 --> 30:48.194
Worse that they succeeded.

30:48.288 --> 30:55.169
But once this bomb actually goes off,
my options will narrow very, very quickly.

31:08.100 --> 31:12.228
This is Cessna 47 Fox. I have just
crossed over to the low desert.

31:12.312 --> 31:15.348
I'm on final line to target.
Any change in my coordinates?

31:15.440 --> 31:21.360
- Negative. They're confirmed as given.
- Copy that. Confirming autopilot 0-8-niner.

31:21.446 --> 31:26.155
- Coordinates are now locked.
- Roger. Over.

31:43.093 --> 31:45.169
- Don't move!
- Hey, hey, hey.

31:45.262 --> 31:48.713
The service is bad enough.
You don't have to shoot me.

31:48.807 --> 31:52.425
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I felt like taking a ride.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.891
How the hell did you get on this plane?

31:54.980 --> 31:58.396
Wasn't that hard.
To them, I'm still head of CTU.

31:59.568 --> 32:02.522
Son of a bitch.

32:04.114 --> 32:06.605
Brought something for ya.

32:08.618 --> 32:10.077
It's a parachute.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.626
I can see what is it, George.

32:11.708 --> 32:15.583
I already told you, I'm
taking this plane in.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.419
That might have made sense
back on the ground,

32:18.503 --> 32:21.173
but let's face it, Jack,
the hard part's over.

32:21.256 --> 32:23.925
You took off, cleared the city.

32:24.009 --> 32:29.347
What's left but flying straight and level
and taking it into a dive?

32:29.431 --> 32:31.922
Am I right?

32:33.518 --> 32:36.555
Unless of course maybe you wanna die.

32:38.815 --> 32:44.236
- What are you talking about?
- You've had a death wish since Teri died.

32:44.321 --> 32:47.156
The way things have been going
for you the past year,

32:47.240 --> 32:50.574
this probably doesn't
look like such a bad idea.

32:50.660 --> 32:56.035
You get to go out in a blaze of glory,
one of the greatest heroes of all time.

32:56.124 --> 32:58.876
Leave your troubles behind.

33:00.462 --> 33:05.966
This could be the easy
way out, huh?

33:08.053 --> 33:09.789
You still got a life, Jack.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.881
You wanna be a real
hero, here's what you do.

33:12.974 --> 33:17.055
You get back down there
and you put the pieces together.

33:17.145 --> 33:21.013
Find a way to forgive yourself
for what happened to your wife,

33:21.108 --> 33:26.897
you make things right with your daughter,
and you go on serving your country.

33:26.988 --> 33:29.444
That'd take some real guts.

33:39.334 --> 33:42.869
Go on, Jack. You got 12 minutes.

33:42.963 --> 33:47.091
What's it gonna be? You wanna live or not?

33:56.601 --> 34:00.469
- You really think you can do this?
- Yes.

34:01.231 --> 34:04.932
You are absolutely sure you can do this?

34:05.944 --> 34:09.194
Jack, I'm supposed to do this.

34:18.873 --> 34:22.492
You need to maintain
this heading and this airspeed.

34:22.585 --> 34:25.148
The second the LAD reads
a minute and a half,

34:25.447 --> 34:27.793
you initiate a dive at a 30-degree angle.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.972
- Won't that get me in early?
- That's the point.

34:35.056 --> 34:41.141
You have to be certain that the bomb is
already in the depression before it goes off.

34:41.228 --> 34:43.304
I got it.

34:53.408 --> 34:55.697
Thank you, George.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.406
Thank you.

35:21.353 --> 35:24.307
Get your chute on
and get the hell outta here.

35:24.397 --> 35:28.858
- I'm staying with you as long as possible.
- I got it together. I'm fine.

35:28.944 --> 35:33.321
This is not negotiable.
I'm bailing out four minutes before impact.

35:33.406 --> 35:35.732
That should get me far enough away.

35:35.826 --> 35:38.613
This is Jack Bauer. Patch me through to CTU.

35:38.703 --> 35:41.491
- Yes, sir. Right away.
- Almeida.

35:41.581 --> 35:45.959
Tony, this is Jack. I need you to get
a helicopter in the air immediately.

35:46.044 --> 35:50.671
We got a change of plans here. I'm bailing
out. George is taking the plane down.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.216
What's George doing there?

35:52.300 --> 35:55.467
We need authentication
from three sources for each voice.

35:55.554 --> 36:01.010
Division has public speeches from ministers.
See if you can get his voice on phone taps.

36:01.101 --> 36:03.177
Michelle.

36:05.313 --> 36:09.691
Send a chopper to trail Jack's plane.
Mason got on board. Don't ask how.

36:09.776 --> 36:13.940
He'll take the plane the rest of the way.
We need that chopper to pick Jack up.

36:14.030 --> 36:16.866
I'll explain later.

36:16.950 --> 36:20.401
Mr Almeida, may I know
what you found on the hard drive?

36:20.495 --> 36:24.991
- You don't have security clearance.
- Mr Almeida.

36:25.083 --> 36:31.702
I and my country have shown good faith
in helping you to find Syed Ali's safe house.

36:31.798 --> 36:35.796
I'm asking you to do the same
by giving me some idea of what's going on.

36:35.886 --> 36:37.565
I'm sorry,
but I can't tell you at this time.

36:37.928 --> 36:40.298
You Americans.

36:42.350 --> 36:46.218
- We Americans what?
- Nothing.

37:04.372 --> 37:06.661
Come.

37:06.750 --> 37:10.617
- Sir, General Bowden's here to see you.
- Of course. Show him in.

37:13.757 --> 37:16.046
- Mr President.
- General Bowden.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.245
I understand the bomb is
over the Mojave now.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.761
It may detonate without
causing loss of life.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.967
- That is our hope.
- That's wonderful news.

37:24.059 --> 37:28.139
- Congratulations on your achievement.
- Thank you, General.

37:28.230 --> 37:32.726
Perhaps it's appropriate to begin
discussing the matter of retaliation.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.941
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

37:35.028 --> 37:40.533
The Joint Chiefs have been assuming
the bomb was the work of Second Wave.

37:40.617 --> 37:43.488
It appears they had the backing
of three governments.

37:43.578 --> 37:47.446
- That's not definite yet, General.
- No, sir. I understand that.

37:47.541 --> 37:50.625
But for planning purposes,
we should proceed as if it is.

37:50.710 --> 37:54.839
I request authority to activate plans
to invade the countries in question.

37:54.923 --> 37:58.624
Activate? There are plans
already in existence?

37:58.718 --> 38:02.847
We have plans for every conceivable
contingency, Mr President.

38:02.931 --> 38:07.225
I see. So what exactly
do you mean by activate?

38:07.310 --> 38:10.003
Putting the relevant
military units on alert,

38:10.203 --> 38:12.222
beginning logistical operations,

38:12.315 --> 38:16.443
coordinating sources regarding
the probable level of resistance

38:16.528 --> 38:19.814
to an invasion by American forces.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.946
Talk of an invasion is premature.

38:22.033 --> 38:26.245
I agree, Mr President.
This is in the planning stages only.

38:30.417 --> 38:32.010
Activate your plan, Colonel.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.957
But take no steps to implement
without my direct authorisation.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.752
Of course, Mr President.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.475
Lynne.

38:49.269 --> 38:52.555
We may be talking about World War III.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.122
OK. I'm set.

39:12.209 --> 39:16.158
George, is there anything
you want me to take care of?

39:16.963 --> 39:20.213
Oddly enough, I think I got
everything squared away.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.918
I even got to spend a
little time with my son.

39:24.012 --> 39:26.503
I didn't even know you had one.

39:28.975 --> 39:32.641
- I'm glad you got to see him.
- Yeah. Me, too.

39:32.729 --> 39:35.647
I don't think he was particularly, but...

39:35.732 --> 39:39.646
Actually, I wouldn't mind
if you checked in on him.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.936
Of course I will.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.879
- It's time.
- Yeah.

40:45.969 --> 40:49.967
Yeah.

40:55.228 --> 40:57.304
Mr President.

40:57.397 --> 41:02.355
At this altitude, the explosion
should be visible on the eastern horizon.

41:02.444 --> 41:05.647
I don't know if you want to take a look.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.926
Three, two...

42:53.305 --> 42:59.853
