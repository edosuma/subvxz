01:13.375 --> 01:15.250
<c.speakerTop>My fellow Avalorans,

01:15.250 --> 01:17.500
<c.speakerTop>today I am sad
to announce

01:17.500 --> 01:20.000
<c.speakerTop>that the brave leader
of our Royal Guard,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.291
<c.speakerTop>Captain Antonio Sandoval,

01:22.291 --> 01:24.291
<c.speakerTop>is retiring.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.416
<c.speaker>-[guards gasp]
-What? Retiring?

01:26.416 --> 01:29.750
<c.speaker>Captain Sandoval embodies
Avalor's best values--

01:29.750 --> 01:33.083
<c.speaker>courage,
selflessness, and honor,

01:33.083 --> 01:36.583
<c.speaker>so we look to him
to nominate four guards

01:36.583 --> 01:39.000
<c.speaker>worthy of replacing him.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.291
<c.speaker>Captain Sandoval?

01:41.291 --> 01:43.708
<c.speaker>I am a man of few words.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.250
<c.speaker>Rico Villalobos!

01:48.250 --> 01:50.083
<c.speaker>Nice!

01:51.208 --> 01:52.416
<c.speaker>Miguel Léon.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.333
<c.speaker>Good job!

01:54.333 --> 01:56.250
<c.speaker>Andreas Sosa.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.208
<c.speaker>Oh! Excuse me.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.708
<c.speaker>And Gabriel Nuñez.

02:03.708 --> 02:06.458
<c.speaker>[chuckles] Whew!

02:06.458 --> 02:08.416
<c.speaker>Yes!

02:08.416 --> 02:10.458
<c.speaker>The four of you
will take part

02:10.458 --> 02:12.958
<c.speaker>in a skills competition
that begins today.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.458
<c.speaker>The first two candidates
to complete the course

02:15.458 --> 02:17.875
<c.speaker>will face off again tomorrow
to decide who will be

02:17.875 --> 02:19.250
<c.speaker>the new captain
of the guard.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
<c.speaker>Anything to add, Captain?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.250
<c.speaker>Captain?

02:24.250 --> 02:25.708
<c.speaker>Dismissed!

02:28.625 --> 02:31.125
<c.speaker>-Lieutenant Nuñez!
-Atten-hut!

02:32.375 --> 02:33.458
<c.speaker>May I have a word?

02:33.458 --> 02:35.291
<c.speaker>Of course,
Your Majesty.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.000
<c.speaker>Gabe! I'm so excited
for you!

02:39.000 --> 02:41.083
<c.speaker>Me too!
I can't believe it.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.416
<c.speaker>I'll be rooting for you!
As your friend.

02:43.416 --> 02:46.625
<c.speaker>As Crown Princess,
may the best guard win.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.416
<c.speaker>I'd have it
no other way.

02:48.416 --> 02:49.625
<c.speaker>Good luck tomorrow.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.833
<c.speaker>I hear it's
a pretty tough course.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.708
<c.speaker>-[chatter]
-Did you see them?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.416
<c.speaker>If Gabe makes captain,

02:56.416 --> 02:59.000
<c.speaker>it will only be
because he's Elena's friend.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.416
<c.speaker>If I make captain,
it'll be because I earned it.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.416
<c.speaker>Oh, the captain
of the Royal Guard

03:04.416 --> 03:07.750
<c.speaker>has always been
from a distinguished
military family,

03:07.750 --> 03:09.375
<c.speaker>like me!

03:09.375 --> 03:10.833
<c.speaker>And never the son
of a baker.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.458
<c.speaker>Like you.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
<c.speaker>Hey, there's nothing wrong
with being a baker.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.375
<c.speaker>If you're making muffins!

03:16.375 --> 03:18.333
<c.speaker>But if you're
leading soldiers,

03:18.333 --> 03:21.208
<c.speaker>you should come
from a military family
like mine.

03:21.208 --> 03:25.083
<c.speaker>This sword belonged
to my father,

03:25.083 --> 03:28.458
<c.speaker>Regimental Sergeant-Major
Hilário Villalobos.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.583
<c.speaker>Gabe, uh, what did
your father pass down to you?

03:31.583 --> 03:33.083
<c.speaker>Um, a spatula?

03:33.083 --> 03:35.250
<c.speaker>[other guards ooh]

03:35.250 --> 03:39.208
<c.speaker>I don't need a fancy sword
to win the competition.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.750
<c.speaker>I can win
with this.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.208
<c.speaker>[other guards] Aww...

03:42.208 --> 03:44.000
<c.speaker>What? This is standard issue!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.458
<c.speaker>We all have the same one!

03:45.458 --> 03:49.875
<c.speaker>[laughs] Show us what you
can do with it, baker boy.

03:49.875 --> 03:53.458
<c.speaker>I will, Regimental
Sergeant-Major boy!

03:53.458 --> 03:56.375
<c.speaker>That sounded
snappier in my head.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.875
<c.speaker>[both grunting]

04:02.750 --> 04:04.875
<c.speaker>Oh, you got him, baker boy!

04:04.875 --> 04:06.416
<c.speaker>-What?
-Ahh!

04:07.708 --> 04:10.083
<c.speaker>Wait, I was distracted.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.958
<c.speaker>Yes, by my incredible
fighting skills.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.625
<c.speaker>With this sword,
I am unstoppable.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.208
<c.speaker>Atten-hut!

04:21.083 --> 04:23.375
<c.speaker>Professor Mendoza
needs a package delivered

04:23.375 --> 04:25.291
<c.speaker>to Avalor's Museum
of Archaeology.

04:25.291 --> 04:26.416
<c.speaker>Any volunteers?

04:26.416 --> 04:27.875
<c.speaker>At your service,
Professor.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.750
<c.speaker>Okay. Now, this is
very important.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.291
<c.speaker>Go directly there.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.458
<c.speaker>Do not open it.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.875
<c.speaker>Protect it with your life.
Is that clear?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.291
<c.speaker>Perfectly clear.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.000
<c.speaker>All right, then.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.291
<c.speaker>Thanks, Gabe.

04:40.416 --> 04:42.458
<c.speaker>Smart move.

04:42.458 --> 04:46.208
<c.speaker>You don't need a good sword
to deliver packages.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.583

10:04.333 --> 10:05.875
<c.speaker>[whistles]

10:05.875 --> 10:07.166
<c.speaker>[neighs]

10:07.166 --> 10:09.708
<c.speaker>The incomparable tenor
El Guapo!

10:09.708 --> 10:12.083
<c.speaker>[cocky laugh]

10:12.083 --> 10:14.291
<c.speaker>Uh, what's gotten
into Gabe?

10:14.291 --> 10:16.291
<c.speaker>I don't know,
but I don't like it.

10:16.291 --> 10:17.583
<c.speaker>[Elena] Neither do I.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.958
<c.speaker>That is definitely not

10:18.958 --> 10:21.125
<c.speaker>how a captain
of the Royal Guard acts.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.708
<c.speaker>I need to talk to him.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.208
<c.speaker>-[snick]
-[chomp]

10:25.208 --> 10:26.291
<c.speaker>Ooh, good grab, Fuego.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.750
<c.speaker>Oh! Why was I
acting like that?

10:30.750 --> 10:32.583
<c.speaker>And talking like that!

10:32.583 --> 10:34.000
<c.speaker>[grunts] Huh?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.125
<c.speaker>How'd it do that?

10:35.125 --> 10:37.166
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
Because this sword

10:37.166 --> 10:38.583
<c.speaker>is enchanted with the spirit

10:38.583 --> 10:43.000
<c.speaker>of the brave
and handsome El Guapo!

10:43.000 --> 10:47.750
<c.speaker>El Guapo? So that's why I said
all those terrible things!

10:47.750 --> 10:50.958
<c.speaker>I gotta get rid
of this sword.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.125
<c.speaker>Huh?

10:52.125 --> 10:53.750
<c.speaker>[grunts]

10:53.750 --> 10:55.833
<c.speaker>[grunting,
sword hitting hand]

10:55.833 --> 10:58.083
<c.speaker>This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.583
<c.speaker>-[neighs]
-[growls]

11:08.375 --> 11:09.458
<c.speaker>Yah!

11:10.458 --> 11:11.458
<c.speaker>[clanks]

11:11.458 --> 11:13.458
<c.speaker>Oh! Argh!

11:13.458 --> 11:15.833
<c.speaker>[grunting] That's it!

11:15.833 --> 11:19.208
<c.speaker>I'm... taking you...
to... the museum!

11:19.208 --> 11:20.750
<c.speaker>[Elena] Gabe?

11:20.750 --> 11:23.208
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
Mm! Princess Elena!

11:23.208 --> 11:24.458
<c.speaker>I need to talk to you.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.208
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
Yes, of course!

11:26.208 --> 11:28.000
<c.speaker>Right after I run
a quick errand.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.416
<c.speaker>-So sorry!
-But-- [coughs, groans]

11:33.083 --> 11:35.875
<c.speaker>Ahh. I should've brought you
here to begin with.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.750
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
No! I am not putting down
this sword!

11:38.750 --> 11:40.875
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
Oh, yes, I am! Ha!

11:40.875 --> 11:43.958
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] No!
[normal voice] Let go!

11:43.958 --> 11:47.333
<c.speaker>[grunting]

11:47.333 --> 11:50.958
<c.speaker>[sighs] I'm glad
that's over. Ha!

11:50.958 --> 11:53.166
<c.speaker>I feel like me again!

11:53.166 --> 11:54.458
<c.speaker>Hyah!

11:59.166 --> 12:01.000
<c.speaker>[gasps] Professor Mendoza!

12:01.000 --> 12:02.458
<c.speaker>[whispers]
Avoid eye contact.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.083
<c.speaker>[nonchalant whistling]

12:05.083 --> 12:06.958
<c.speaker>Oh! Lieutenant Nuñez!

12:08.250 --> 12:10.083
<c.speaker>Oh, Professor Mendoza!

12:10.083 --> 12:11.333
<c.speaker>I didn't see you there.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.708
<c.speaker>Thanks again for delivering
that package for me.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.250
<c.speaker>You're welcome!
[chuckles nervously]

12:15.250 --> 12:17.208
<c.speaker>I didn't want
to alarm you yesterday,

12:17.208 --> 12:21.083
<c.speaker>but now I can tell you
the package contained
a cursed sword.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.458
<c.speaker>[gasps] You don't say!

12:23.458 --> 12:25.708
<c.speaker>That's why I kept insisting
you not open it!

12:25.708 --> 12:29.291
<c.speaker>Which I didn't.
Open it. Even a little bit.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.958
<c.speaker>The sword once belonged
to a vain, aggressive general

12:32.958 --> 12:34.416
<c.speaker>named El Guapo.

12:34.416 --> 12:37.333
<c.speaker>If anyone is foolish enough
to pick up the sword,

12:37.333 --> 12:39.708
<c.speaker>they'll start acting
like El Guapo!

12:40.708 --> 12:42.000
<c.speaker>And what's more,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.958
<c.speaker>once the sword
finds a new owner,

12:43.958 --> 12:46.000
<c.speaker>it won't leave their side.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.291
<c.speaker>-Can the curse be broken?
-Ha! Well, if it can,

12:48.291 --> 12:50.083
<c.speaker>nobody's figured out how!

12:50.083 --> 12:51.708
<c.speaker>That's why I wanted it
sealed up

12:51.708 --> 12:53.958
<c.speaker>in a special glass case
in the museum.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.250
<c.speaker>-Uh-oh.
-[neighs]

12:55.250 --> 12:57.083
<c.speaker>[gasps] Lieutenant Nuñez!

12:57.083 --> 12:58.208
<c.speaker>Shh! [grunts]

12:59.708 --> 13:01.708
<c.speaker>I beg your pardon!

13:04.416 --> 13:06.583
<c.speaker>[gasps] Ride, Fuego!

13:06.583 --> 13:08.000
<c.speaker>[coughing]

13:12.083 --> 13:13.500
<c.speaker>-[screeches]
-[neighs]

13:18.958 --> 13:21.833
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
Ah-ha! I'm Guapo again!

13:21.833 --> 13:23.708
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
No, I'm Gabe!

13:23.708 --> 13:25.208
<c.speaker>Guapo!
Gabe!

13:25.208 --> 13:27.000
<c.speaker>Guapo!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.875
<c.speaker>[groans] Fuego,
take me to Mateo!

13:29.875 --> 13:31.291
<c.speaker>Hurry!

13:32.750 --> 13:34.958
<c.speaker>[normal voice] So then
I picked up the sword...

13:34.958 --> 13:37.708
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
...and became the most amazing
warrior who ever lived.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.000
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
Because the sword is cursed,
it changed my personality...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.875
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
...to a better one!

13:41.875 --> 13:44.208
<c.speaker>-[normal voice] Help!
-I've read about cursed objects,

13:44.208 --> 13:45.958
<c.speaker>but never seen one up close.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.583
<c.speaker>This is fascinating!

13:47.583 --> 13:48.708
<c.speaker>Mateo!

13:48.708 --> 13:50.708
<c.speaker>Okay, okay.
I can try.

13:50.708 --> 13:53.125
<c.speaker>But breaking this type
of curse is tricky.

13:53.125 --> 13:57.250
<c.speaker>The potion takes hours
to brew, and even then
it might not work.

13:57.250 --> 14:00.166
<c.speaker>[normal voice] Please try...
[Guapo voice] ...to forget
I even came to you.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.458
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
Mind your own business, Guapo!
[Guapo voice] I am!

14:02.458 --> 14:04.875
<c.speaker>Um, can you two
take it outside?

14:04.875 --> 14:06.875
<c.speaker>I need to concentrate.

14:06.875 --> 14:09.833
<c.speaker>We'll be at--
I mean, <i>I'll </i>be at the barracks.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.208
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] Preparing
for tomorrow's victory!

14:17.583 --> 14:19.750
<c.speaker>There you are.
Do you have the potion?

14:19.750 --> 14:22.000
<c.speaker>It took me all night,
but yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.875
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] I will
never drink that!

14:24.875 --> 14:27.083
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
Oh, yes, I will!

14:27.083 --> 14:29.416
<c.speaker>Now, remember,
if this potion works,

14:29.416 --> 14:31.333
<c.speaker>you can't pick up
that sword again,

14:31.333 --> 14:33.000
<c.speaker>or the curse will return.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
<c.speaker>Wait, so I can't get rid
of El Guapo and keep the sword?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.958
<c.speaker>But if I don't use
this sword,

14:38.958 --> 14:41.750
<c.speaker>I might not become
captain of the guard.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.833
<c.speaker>If that's
so important to you,

14:43.833 --> 14:46.250
<c.speaker>then maybe you
should stay El Guapo.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.625
<c.speaker>The choice is yours.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.125
<c.speaker>I have to drink it.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.250
<c.speaker>[cushion squeaks]

15:06.416 --> 15:08.958
<c.speaker>"Special delivery
to baker boy"?

15:08.958 --> 15:11.500
<c.speaker>"Never compete
on an empty stomach."

15:11.500 --> 15:13.208
<c.speaker>[scoffs] Rico!

15:13.208 --> 15:16.000
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
Guapo would show Rico!

15:22.708 --> 15:24.500
<c.speaker>-Gabe! Finally!
-[groans]

15:24.500 --> 15:26.458
<c.speaker>I've been looking
all over for you!

15:26.458 --> 15:28.291
<c.speaker>Hey, Elena, what's up?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.125
<c.speaker>That's what I
wanna know!

15:30.125 --> 15:32.291
<c.speaker>You haven't been acting
like yourself.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.458
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] I've been
acting better, no?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.875
<c.speaker>Mm, no.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.208
<c.speaker>Yesterday you cut Rico off

15:37.208 --> 15:39.166
<c.speaker>and didn't even stop
to help him!

15:39.166 --> 15:41.166
<c.speaker>Um, why would I?

15:41.166 --> 15:45.333
<c.speaker>Gabe, the captain
of my father's Royal Guard
used to say

15:45.333 --> 15:48.083
<c.speaker>the Royal Guard
is a brotherhood,

15:48.083 --> 15:50.208
<c.speaker>and whenever
one guard falls,

15:50.208 --> 15:52.458
<c.speaker>another must pick him up.

15:52.458 --> 15:56.125
<c.speaker>Yes, in battle,
but this was a race.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.875
<c.speaker>It doesn't matter.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.000
<c.speaker>If you want to be captain,
you have to be

16:00.000 --> 16:02.333
<c.speaker>a great soldier
<i>and </i>a great person.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.500
<c.speaker>Yes! I am the best person!

16:04.500 --> 16:07.208
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
I-I mean, I <i>try </i>my best.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.333
<c.speaker>Well, you may want
to try harder.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.166
<c.speaker>I... [sighs]

16:11.166 --> 16:13.000
<c.speaker>Look, you have to understand

16:13.000 --> 16:15.208
<c.speaker>why I haven't been acting
like myself lately.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.000
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
Speak for yourself!

16:17.000 --> 16:18.750
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
That's what I'm trying to do!

16:18.750 --> 16:23.958
<c.speaker>Oh...kay.
Uh, what's going on, Gabe?

16:23.958 --> 16:27.708
<c.speaker>This sword was in the package
I was supposed to deliver
to the museum.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.125
<c.speaker>Then what are you
doing with it?

16:30.125 --> 16:31.875
<c.speaker>I... borrowed it.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.333
<c.speaker>But it's enchanted,

16:33.333 --> 16:35.333
<c.speaker>and now I'm cursed
with the spirit

16:35.333 --> 16:36.833
<c.speaker>of the general
who owned it.

16:36.833 --> 16:40.291
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice]
The incomparable General Guapo!

16:40.291 --> 16:41.583
<c.speaker>Ha ha!

16:41.583 --> 16:44.000
<c.speaker>[scoffs] Uh, you're cursed?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.708
<c.speaker>But why would you even take
the sword in the first place?

16:46.708 --> 16:49.166
<c.speaker>I guess I wanted to prove
that the son of a baker

16:49.166 --> 16:51.125
<c.speaker>could be captain of the guard,

16:51.125 --> 16:55.333
<c.speaker>and I couldn't win
unless I had a great sword.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.375
<c.speaker>Gabe, a sword doesn't
make the soldier.

16:58.375 --> 17:00.291
<c.speaker>The solider makes the sword!

17:00.291 --> 17:03.000
<c.speaker>Huh. You're right.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.375
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] Uph! What kind
of nonsense is that?

17:05.375 --> 17:08.375
<c.speaker>[normal voice] She means
I don't <i>need </i>a fancy sword,

17:08.375 --> 17:12.291
<c.speaker>and I certainly don't need
El Guapo making me act
like an obnoxious fool.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.625
<c.speaker>[Guapo voice] Fool?
Who are you calling a fool?

17:14.625 --> 17:17.625
<c.speaker>[normal voice]
This curse ends now
with Mateo's potion.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.000
<c.speaker>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.416
<c.speaker>I won't let you do it!

17:21.416 --> 17:23.250
<c.speaker>[struggling]

17:23.250 --> 17:24.958
<c.speaker>Come on!

17:24.958 --> 17:26.208
<c.speaker>Just--!

17:26.208 --> 17:27.750
<c.speaker>I won't let
you do it!

17:27.750 --> 17:30.583
<c.speaker>Please! Huh! Come on!

17:30.583 --> 17:31.583
<c.speaker>[humming]

17:31.583 --> 17:33.875
<c.speaker>Oh, um...

17:33.875 --> 17:37.625
<c.speaker>El Guapo, I hear
you're a great swordsman.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.083
<c.speaker>The best that ever lived!

17:39.083 --> 17:40.875
<c.speaker>Do you think you can cut
that crate in half?

17:40.875 --> 17:42.208
<c.speaker>Of course!

17:43.416 --> 17:44.458
<c.speaker>[grunts]

17:45.875 --> 17:47.416
<c.speaker>Mm!

17:47.416 --> 17:48.583
<c.speaker>Quick! Drink it now!

17:48.583 --> 17:49.625
<c.speaker>Ah!

17:51.458 --> 17:53.833
<c.speaker>Thanks, Elena.

17:53.833 --> 17:57.375
<c.speaker>[gasps] What treachery!

18:02.875 --> 18:05.250
<c.speaker>-[sighs]
-Well, is the spell broken?

18:05.250 --> 18:08.250
<c.speaker>Yep, it's just me in here.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.250
<c.speaker>Then we'd better hurry.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.583
<c.speaker>The competition's
about to start.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.250
<c.speaker>[military drumming]

18:15.583 --> 18:17.458
<c.speaker>Congratulations,
lieutenants.

18:17.458 --> 18:19.375
<c.speaker>You've made it
to the final round.

18:19.375 --> 18:23.333
<c.speaker>The winner becomes
the next captain of the guard.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.291
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

18:27.875 --> 18:31.125
<c.speaker>Captain Sandoval,
I hope your replacement

18:31.125 --> 18:34.416
<c.speaker>shows the same honor
and integrity that you do.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.083
<c.speaker>Yes.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.375
<c.speaker>He really is
a man of few words.

18:41.958 --> 18:43.458
<c.speaker>"Yes."

18:46.458 --> 18:47.833
<c.speaker>On your marks...

18:47.833 --> 18:49.708
<c.speaker>You going to trip me
like last time?

18:49.708 --> 18:52.000
<c.speaker>-What?
-Get set!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.125
<c.speaker>It was an accident!

18:53.125 --> 18:54.416
<c.speaker>Go!

18:56.291 --> 18:57.875
<c.speaker>[grunting]

18:57.875 --> 18:59.333
<c.speaker>And it wasn't really me!

18:59.333 --> 19:01.333
<c.speaker>Huh! Smelled like you!

19:06.875 --> 19:09.333
<c.speaker>-Come on, Gabe!
-Do it, Rico!

19:09.333 --> 19:11.333
<c.speaker>You got it, Villalobos!

19:25.458 --> 19:28.500
<c.speaker>-[snap]
-Whoa-ow!

19:28.500 --> 19:29.708
<c.speaker>Rico fell!

19:29.708 --> 19:30.708
<c.speaker>[plate shatters]

19:30.708 --> 19:32.416
<c.speaker>[groans]

19:32.416 --> 19:33.458
<c.speaker>You got this, Gabe!

19:33.458 --> 19:34.875
<c.speaker>[panting]

19:43.833 --> 19:45.375
<c.speaker>[groans]

19:45.375 --> 19:46.708
<c.speaker>[sighs]

19:50.500 --> 19:52.458
<c.speaker>-You okay?
-What are you doing?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.833
<c.speaker>You could've won!

19:53.833 --> 19:55.416
<c.speaker>When one Royal Guard falls,

19:55.416 --> 19:58.416
<c.speaker>another must pick him up,
no matter what.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.166
<c.speaker>We're crossing
that finish line <i>together. </i>

20:07.625 --> 20:10.375
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

20:21.125 --> 20:24.458
<c.speaker>That was an amazing display
of camaraderie.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.500
<c.speaker>But, since you both
crossed the finish line
at the same time,

20:27.500 --> 20:29.833
<c.speaker>Captain Sandoval and I
must discuss

20:29.833 --> 20:31.583
<c.speaker>which one of you
to promote.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.583
<c.speaker>Permission to speak,
Princess Elena.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.583
<c.speaker>Go on,
Lieutenant Villalobos.

20:35.583 --> 20:37.375
<c.speaker>I know I speak
for all the guards here

20:37.375 --> 20:40.583
<c.speaker>when I say Lieutenant Nuñez
should be the new captain.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.375
<c.speaker>What?

20:42.375 --> 20:45.000
<c.speaker>He could've won,
but he came back
for me instead,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.625
<c.speaker>because that's the kind
of man he is,

20:47.625 --> 20:49.500
<c.speaker>a man of honor,

20:49.500 --> 20:53.708
<c.speaker>and it would be our honor
to serve under him.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.500
<c.speaker>What do you think,
Captain?

21:02.458 --> 21:04.750
<c.speaker>They have chosen well.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.458
<c.speaker>-Whoo-hoo!
-[whistles]

21:09.000 --> 21:10.416
<c.speaker>Okay, then.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.458
<c.speaker>Gabe-- I mean, ahem,
Lieutenant Nuñez,

21:13.458 --> 21:17.583
<c.speaker>I hereby name you captain
of the Royal Guard.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.583
<c.speaker>I present you
with your captain's sword.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.458
<c.speaker>Uhh...

21:22.458 --> 21:25.583
<c.speaker>This one's not cursed.
Mateo checked.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.583
<c.speaker>[Mateo] All good!

21:29.750 --> 21:31.583
<c.speaker>Congratulations.

21:31.583 --> 21:36.416
<c.speaker>And, uh, sorry about all that
baker boy and empanada stuff.

21:36.416 --> 21:39.750
<c.speaker>That's okay,
because my first act as captain

21:39.750 --> 21:42.208
<c.speaker>is to tell you to clean up
those empanadas,

21:42.208 --> 21:44.000
<c.speaker>Lieutenant Villalobos!

21:44.000 --> 21:46.750
<c.speaker>[laughing]

21:48.000 --> 21:50.166
<c.speaker>No, seriously,
clean it up.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.958
<c.speaker>Gabe, I'm really proud of you.

21:52.958 --> 21:54.583
<c.speaker>Thank you for reminding me

21:54.583 --> 21:56.875
<c.speaker>that the sword
doesn't make the soldier.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.458
<c.speaker>The soldier makes the sword.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.458
<c.speaker>♪♪
