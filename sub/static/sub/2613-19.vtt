(phone ringing)

00:06.605 --> 00:10.342
(ringing)

00:10.342 --> 00:12.611
No one is available.

00:12.611 --> 00:15.014
Please leave a message.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.382
(beep)

00:16.382 --> 00:18.851
Jane, you there?

00:18.851 --> 00:21.621
Pick up.

00:21.821 --> 00:25.891
Okay... I'll call back later.

00:25.891 --> 00:28.327
(sniffling)

00:28.327 --> 00:30.029
(phone ringing)

00:30.029 --> 00:31.664
(sobbing gasp)

00:31.664 --> 00:33.365
No one is available.

00:33.365 --> 00:35.768
Please leave a message.

00:35.768 --> 00:36.502
(beep)

00:36.502 --> 00:41.530
Slut. You can't hide
from me, bitch.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.473
Jane, you there?

00:46.478 --> 00:48.914
Now, didn't I tell you...

00:48.914 --> 00:51.644
not to bite your nails?!

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

(door opening softly)

01:22.982 --> 01:24.116
(scratching softly)

01:24.116 --> 01:25.885
(gasping
)

01:25.885 --> 01:27.119
(whimpering softly)

01:27.119 --> 01:28.087
Shoo, Peanut.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.256
Go away. Go away.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.689
(whimperin)

01:42.034 --> 01:43.002
(screaming)

01:43.002 --> 01:47.564
(screaming and crying)

01:52.778 --> 01:54.302
Posed?

01:56.315 --> 01:57.907
Reading my mind.

01:59.518 --> 02:01.787
What do you make
of the smears?

02:01.787 --> 02:04.857
It's definitely
not blood.

02:04.857 --> 02:07.917
Wrong color, texture.

02:15.868 --> 02:17.563
It's hair dye.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.739
Her hair's still wet.

02:20.739 --> 02:25.244
You think
the assailant surprised her
while she was dyeing her hair?

02:25.244 --> 02:26.879
Who called it in?

02:26.879 --> 02:29.281
Neighbor lady...
doing the dishes with her window open.

02:29.281 --> 02:31.884
Heard the dog
yelping, evidently.

02:31.884 --> 02:33.519
Called the cops.

02:33.519 --> 02:36.955
There's no sign
of forced entry.

02:37.122 --> 02:38.919
The bathroom window's
nailed shut.

02:43.862 --> 02:48.133
So, has anyone
seen this dog?

02:48.133 --> 02:53.672
Dog bed, dog bowl,
dog food; no dog.

02:53.672 --> 02:57.743
Triple locks
on all the doors.

02:57.743 --> 03:00.075
Every shade drawn.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.981
State-of-the-art
alarm system.

03:05.985 --> 03:08.010
Far as we know, her place was perfectly,
hermetically sealed

03:08.153 --> 03:11.657
until the cops
batter-rammed their way in.

03:11.657 --> 03:13.591
Prisoner in
her own home?

03:14.593 --> 03:16.322
So, how did he get in?

03:16.962 --> 03:18.998
A better question...
how did he get out?

03:54.033 --> 03:55.334
Aluminum foil.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.436
Keeps the
sunlight out.

03:57.436 --> 04:00.667
Keeps the eyeballs out, too.

04:09.281 --> 04:10.549
(gasping)

04:10.549 --> 04:12.642
Sorry, Nick.

04:14.253 --> 04:18.057
You've been staring
at this girl for ten minutes.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.892
Do you know her?

04:19.892 --> 04:21.360
No.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.395
Why don't you
go do the bedroom?

04:23.395 --> 04:24.630
I'll get the coroner
in here

04:24.630 --> 04:26.465
and finish up
in the bathroom.

04:26.465 --> 04:28.797
Sure.

04:35.007 --> 04:39.011
Hey, Catherine,
I'll get that.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.813
No. I got it.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.077
Tweeze me.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.681
Thank you.

04:51.657 --> 04:53.425
So, what do you think?

04:53.425 --> 04:56.028
A little thick
for a human hair.

04:56.028 --> 04:57.996
No, I've seen
them this thick.

04:57.996 --> 04:59.098
Really?
Yeah.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.225
I'll get it to the lab.

05:02.267 --> 05:05.704
Oh, and don't forget
what's under the bed.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.139
Why? What's
under the bed?

05:07.139 --> 05:11.610
Something that you would
have caught eventually...

05:11.610 --> 05:13.378
Crime Stopper.

05:13.378 --> 05:14.213
(chuckles)

05:14.213 --> 05:18.115
- No one's going to
let me live that
one down, are they? - No.

05:18.383 --> 05:20.185
You know, now that
you're a celebrity,

05:20.185 --> 05:23.388
you may want to think
about getting a new shirt.

05:23.388 --> 05:24.456
Yeah? Well...

05:24.456 --> 05:26.358
I'm short on options.

05:26.358 --> 05:29.088
Besides, the dry cleaners
keeps losing my stuff.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.138
What did you get?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.739
Grocery bag

05:40.739 --> 05:42.441
with a red smudge.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.209
Good. Fume it.

05:44.209 --> 05:47.440
Tell Sara and Warrick
to grab a couple shovels and dig in, too.

05:58.223 --> 06:00.225
(sighing)

06:00.225 --> 06:03.162
(laughter)

06:03.162 --> 06:04.763
Who wrote this?

06:04.763 --> 06:06.965
You're kidding me, right?

06:06.965 --> 06:09.668
"Nick Stokes,
Crime Stopper."

06:09.668 --> 06:10.936
(both chuckling)

06:10.936 --> 06:13.138
You went Hollywood
on me, man.

06:13.138 --> 06:14.873
And I quote,
"In his off time

06:14.873 --> 06:18.138
he enjoys creating
and inventing toys."

06:18.277 --> 06:20.179
That's fascinating. What kind of toys
do you make, Nick?

06:20.179 --> 06:23.282
I thought I got my hands on all
those departmental newsletters.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.449
Where'd you get those?

06:24.449 --> 06:26.007
Greg.
Greg.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.983
Yeah, that figures.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.555
All right, listen,
Griss wants us to divide and conquer.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.185
Blond hair for you, Warrick.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.861
I do love a blonde.

06:35.861 --> 06:36.728
Sara,

06:36.728 --> 06:38.830
you're on phone records.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.162
Yay.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.202
Hey, I wasn't done
reading that.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.204
Yes, you are.
(chuckling)

06:45.204 --> 06:47.906
I know two things for certain...

06:47.906 --> 06:51.310
Jane Galloway died
from a lack of O2,

06:51.310 --> 06:53.712
and she's
a natural blonde.

06:53.712 --> 06:55.948
What are you looking
at me for?

06:55.948 --> 06:57.282
Sorry.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.884
So, what...

06:58.884 --> 07:00.181
suffocation?

07:00.219 --> 07:02.221
It certainly looks that way.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.223
Uh, petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes,

07:04.223 --> 07:09.559
deoxygenation led to cyanosis,
hence the blue lips...

07:11.330 --> 07:13.398
blue fingertips

07:13.398 --> 07:15.067
and blue face.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.736
No ligature marks
on her neck.

07:17.736 --> 07:19.838
If she had struggled
with her assailant,

07:19.838 --> 07:23.342
that effort alone could have
limited her oxygen intake,

07:23.342 --> 07:27.301
causing further O2 depletion
of the brain.

07:31.483 --> 07:34.319
Easy kill.

07:34.319 --> 07:35.587
Sexual assault?

07:35.587 --> 07:37.289
No physical findings.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.758
You'll have
to check the kit.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.461
So, he murders her,
poses her,

07:42.461 --> 07:45.225
yet he doesn't rob her
or rape her.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.399
So, what's his agenda?

07:47.399 --> 07:49.924
How's that platinum blonde
coming?

07:50.269 --> 07:52.271
- Wrong question. - Come on, Greg

07:52.271 --> 07:53.605
I'm not getting
anything out of Trace.

07:53.605 --> 07:55.340
I was hoping you
could help me out here.

07:55.340 --> 07:59.978
I took a snip, ran a crossed
immuno-electrophoresis.

07:59.978 --> 08:01.146
Didn't pass.

08:01.146 --> 08:02.714
Not hair?
Not human?

08:02.714 --> 08:05.050
What are you reading?

08:05.050 --> 08:07.419
This is Pink.

08:07.419 --> 08:09.688
Pink, this is Warrick.

08:09.688 --> 08:11.823
Do you
know
how hot you are?

08:11.823 --> 08:12.524
Ssss!

08:12.524 --> 08:13.725
Bet I know someone
who's hotter,

08:13.725 --> 08:16.428
and I'm not talking
about looks.

08:16.428 --> 08:17.796
Yeah?
Yeah.

08:17.796 --> 08:19.264
How mad is he?

08:19.264 --> 08:21.357
Watch your back.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.573
Heard you were
looking for me?

08:28.573 --> 08:31.872
Greg. Come here. I want to talk
to you for a sec.

08:32.311 --> 08:37.349
- Come on. - What's up?

08:37.349 --> 08:40.284
Stop invading my privacy, man.
I don't like it.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.120
I'm just trying
to do my job around here.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.678
I don't need
the extra attention.

08:44.323 --> 08:48.460
Okay. But, I mean,
you are the one who's doing the
"Forensic Spotlight"

08:48.460 --> 08:49.961
in the department
newsletter.

08:49.961 --> 08:51.163
I didn't
do anything, man.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.265
Someone from the community
wrote a letter of commendation.

08:53.265 --> 08:55.100
Public Affairs
ran it. Cool?

08:55.100 --> 08:56.829
Cool.

08:59.037 --> 09:00.372
(sighing)

09:00.372 --> 09:03.008
So, uh... what
are you fuming?

09:03.008 --> 09:05.477
Plastic bag
from the crime scene.

09:05.477 --> 09:06.945
Trying to get lucky...

09:06.945 --> 09:10.142
see if I can get
some prints off it.

09:11.016 --> 09:14.315
She die
of suffocation?

09:27.999 --> 09:30.399
(screaming)

09:31.403 --> 09:33.872
Did some digging on Jane Galloway.

09:33.872 --> 09:35.607
Her boyfriend had
a TRO against him.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.042
And, according
to his phone records,

09:37.042 --> 09:39.945
the guy called Jane 13 times
the day of the murder.

09:39.945 --> 09:41.179
That's 13 times
too many,

09:41.179 --> 09:42.948
according to the
restraining order.

09:42.948 --> 09:45.217
- We're going to
check out his house. - I'll be on my cell.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.052
Grissom,
you got a second?

09:47.052 --> 09:47.882
I got a mystery.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.288
- No Becke Line. - Yeah.

09:51.356 --> 09:55.588
Hair refracts light
under cross-polarization, but glass doesn't.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.393
Well, it's not a hair. It's a synthetic fiber.

09:58.363 --> 10:02.067
Glass... what do you
think, fiberglass?

10:02.067 --> 10:03.227
Maybe.

10:03.368 --> 10:04.369
This could be
a lot of things.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.303
You'll figure it out.

10:07.272 --> 10:09.706
(pounding on door)

10:12.411 --> 10:14.913
Looks like the boyfriend
skipped out on us.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.813
(sighing)

10:19.451 --> 10:22.420
Hey, Brass?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.655
Isn't that his car?

10:28.260 --> 10:32.431
Control,
this is P-9241 requesting backup
and medical assistance,

10:32.431 --> 10:34.433
the 1800 block of Newhaven Road.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.402
Possible 419.

10:37.402 --> 10:39.427
P-9241, copy.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.046
(gasping)

10:48.046 --> 10:49.714
All right,
all right.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.950
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.552
Sit down
on the ground.

10:53.552 --> 10:54.886
Sit down,
sit down.

10:54.886 --> 10:56.288
Sit down;
just sit.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.024
Sir, are you okay?

10:59.024 --> 11:00.787
You all right? You seem injured.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.961
No, I'm all right.

11:02.961 --> 11:05.953
- Are you Adam Piorio? - Yes.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.762
Any idea how you got this blood?

11:12.771 --> 11:13.839
I don't remember.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.374
We're going
to take you to a place

11:16.374 --> 11:18.899
to help you
remember.

11:20.011 --> 11:20.909
Let's start again.

11:21.913 --> 11:23.107
What happened last night?

11:23.448 --> 11:25.109
I'm telling you,
I don't know.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.453
Adam, we're analyzing
the blood that we
found on your shirt with the blood
of your girlfriend.

11:28.453 --> 11:30.478
It's going
to tell us everything that we
want to know.

11:30.922 --> 11:33.091
Look, we broke up
a few weeks ago. She...

11:33.091 --> 11:35.494
She started acting
weird for no reason.

11:35.494 --> 11:39.590
She had a TRO against you.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.701
Something must have happened
to spook her.

11:42.701 --> 11:43.602
She changed overnight.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.404
She... she wouldn't return
any of my phone calls.

11:46.404 --> 11:48.306
She started calling
in sick at work.

11:48.306 --> 11:51.376
Barricading herself
in her own house.

11:51.376 --> 11:54.513
So, you went to Jane's
house. What next?

11:54.513 --> 11:55.878
We started arguing.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.518
Open this door.
What do you mean I can't come within
1,000 feet of you?

11:59.518 --> 12:00.919
Open the door.
Stay away from me!

12:00.919 --> 12:04.222
I was afraid she was going
to call the cops, so I-I left.

12:04.222 --> 12:05.357
Well, that's interesting.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.527
Because, according to her phone
records, she never did...

12:08.527 --> 12:09.361
call the cops.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.163
But you called
her 13 times.

12:12.163 --> 12:14.529
Once, you're in love. Twice, you're

12:15.200 --> 12:17.235
More than three,
you're a stalker.

12:17.235 --> 12:18.036
We just broke up.

12:18.036 --> 12:21.506
All right, I was...
I was rolling on "E" last night.

12:21.506 --> 12:21.740
Give me a break.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.543
Adam, that's not all
you were taking last night.

12:24.543 --> 12:27.546
I was on a lot of stuff
last night. I was a space cadet.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.138
I'm not a murderer.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.883
Blood doesn't match our victim.

12:31.883 --> 12:36.684
The girlfriend
of a Ricco Manzo filed the police report last

12:37.489 --> 12:39.891
It seems that Adam, here,
put Ricco in the hospital with a broken nose

12:39.891 --> 12:41.359
from a fight
at Bar 911.

12:41.359 --> 12:44.062
Well, that's
a lucky alibi.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.155
Roll him out of here.

13:13.358 --> 13:16.293
You have mail.

13:20.498 --> 13:21.833
Horndog?

13:21.833 --> 13:24.358
There's a blast from the past.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.291
What did your prom date say
when you called her?

13:46.291 --> 13:49.628
She said that she
was cleaning out
the attic one day,

13:49.628 --> 13:50.562
stumbled upon them,

13:50.562 --> 13:53.131
thought she'd
send them to me
for a laugh.

13:53.131 --> 13:54.132
You think she's a suspect?

13:54.132 --> 13:55.634
No. She lives
in Bosnia, man.

13:55.634 --> 13:56.999
Maine or something.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.069
She's got three kids.

13:58.069 --> 14:02.301
What's she going to do,
fly in for murder?

14:02.907 --> 14:04.676
(chuckles)

14:04.676 --> 14:06.778
Stranger things have happened.

14:06.778 --> 14:08.046
I don't know.

14:08.046 --> 14:11.650
Something in
my gut tells me
it isn't right.

14:11.650 --> 14:16.821
- Hey, what if somebody from work tapped

14:16.821 --> 14:19.324
Yeah. Maybe I forgot
to log off one day.

14:19.324 --> 14:20.492
Now you're tripping.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.660
No. I'm serious.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.662
Somebody
had
to
have read my e-mail.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.096
Change your password.

14:25.096 --> 14:28.066
I already did.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.467
How does this relate
to the case?

14:29.467 --> 14:31.670
Well, he was an eyewitness,
sort of.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.339
I mean, he says he had a vision
of Jane Galloway's murder

14:34.339 --> 14:35.507
hours before it happened.

14:35.507 --> 14:36.041
He's a psychic?

14:36.041 --> 14:36.841
Well, he has details.

14:36.841 --> 14:40.333
He has details
that weren't on the news or the press

14:46.051 --> 14:48.086
Mr. Pearson.

14:48.086 --> 14:49.754
Sit down.

14:49.754 --> 14:52.424
Captain Brass
tells me that, uh...

14:52.424 --> 14:55.093
you had some
sort of "vision"

14:55.093 --> 14:57.696
regarding Jane
Galloway's murder.

14:57.696 --> 14:58.963
Yes, I did.

14:58.963 --> 15:00.098
What kind of vision?

15:00.098 --> 15:03.659
Screaming face
in a plastic womb.

15:05.270 --> 15:08.535
Blood shower.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.703
Anything else?

15:16.815 --> 15:19.384
Three hearts beating very fast.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.252
Two large, one small.

15:21.252 --> 15:23.855
(screaming)

15:23.855 --> 15:25.990
(dog barking)

15:25.990 --> 15:28.460
Okay.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.894
Thank you.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.398
This is your
eyewitness?

15:33.398 --> 15:35.696
The dog didn't
make it, did it?

15:41.306 --> 15:43.074
What about Jane's
work history?

15:43.074 --> 15:44.743
Secretary
at a brokerage firm.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.746
About three weeks
from the day of her death,

15:47.746 --> 15:49.338
she took a leave of absence.

15:50.348 --> 15:51.716
Medical records?

15:51.716 --> 15:52.751
She saw Dr. Slater.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.754
Had a prescription
for Valium and Librium.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.756
Severe anxiety due
to personal reasons.

15:57.756 --> 16:01.593
One day back from leave,
Jane quits her job.

16:01.593 --> 16:02.594
No notice.

16:02.594 --> 16:03.762
Hotel receipts show

16:03.762 --> 16:06.598
she checked into the Monaco
for two nights.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.266
Aweek before that,

16:08.266 --> 16:10.757
she goes on a frightened woman
shopping spree.

16:11.102 --> 16:13.605
Hardware shop receipts
for locks.

16:13.605 --> 16:16.074
Locksmiths. Alarm installations.

16:16.074 --> 16:16.808
Phone screeners.

16:16.808 --> 16:19.844
The voice on her
answering machine... electronic.

16:19.844 --> 16:24.338
She changes
her telephone number. She cancels all
but one of her credit cards.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.553
It's as if she's trying
to make herself disappear.

16:28.553 --> 16:30.955
Make no mistake. Jane Galloway was

16:30.955 --> 16:33.792
Emotional terrorism
at its finest.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.760
And her boyfriend had an alibi?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.797
Here's the, uh... worst part.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.799
Uh... I ran a phone check

16:40.799 --> 16:43.529
on all her
incoming calls.

16:43.935 --> 16:47.200
Guess where
they were coming from.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.778
Inside her house.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.782
So I ran Merlin's, uh... credit card

16:57.782 --> 16:58.783
with his
permission.

16:58.783 --> 17:01.920
Do you know where he was
the night of the murder?

17:01.920 --> 17:03.922
Monaco Hotel.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.256
Room 834.

17:05.256 --> 17:08.492
Guess who was in
the adjoining room?

17:08.492 --> 17:11.428
Jane Galloway.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.447
Why didn't you tell us
you were staying here?

17:29.447 --> 17:32.083
I didn't know
she was your victim.

17:32.083 --> 17:33.618
According
to the front desk.

17:33.618 --> 17:36.855
You placed a call to Jane
Galloway's room at, uh...

17:36.855 --> 17:40.859
9:12 p.m.?
Lasting 21 seconds?

17:40.859 --> 17:46.092
- May I ask what you two
were talking about? - Energy.

17:47.098 --> 17:48.166
(phone rings)

17:48.166 --> 17:49.531
(gasps)

17:52.670 --> 17:54.205
- Hello? - I'm calling from the next room.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.540
I don't mean to alarm you,

17:55.540 --> 17:58.839
but I'm feeling some negative
energy coming from your room.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.715
Sh... she wouldn't talk to me.
I... I get that a lot.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.650
But, evidently,
you called her back.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.953
Yes. She picked up,
and hung up.

18:08.953 --> 18:13.424
Phone records say that
she received three calls.

18:13.424 --> 18:14.225
Twice, I believe.

18:14.225 --> 18:17.888
The front desk
records also show that she checked
out that night.

18:18.062 --> 18:22.897
And you checked out
shortly thereafter. Why?

18:23.167 --> 18:26.261
Well, she was suffering,
and I shared her fear.

18:28.573 --> 18:32.873
Seems my intuition was accurate,
as it turns out.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.918
(sighs)

18:39.918 --> 18:42.253
You don't believe me, do you?

18:42.253 --> 18:44.589
Mr. Pearson,
I'm a scientist.

18:44.589 --> 18:46.724
And I am a clairvoyant.

18:46.724 --> 18:50.495
You see science
without abstractions.

18:50.495 --> 18:53.731
I see visions with abstractions.

18:53.731 --> 18:56.928
Am I less credible than you, Mr. Grissom?

18:56.968 --> 19:00.939
These visions that you've had
in the past...

19:00.939 --> 19:02.607
nothing specific triggered them?

19:02.607 --> 19:07.601
Sometimes a touch or an object.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.514
- Fear? - Sure.

19:09.514 --> 19:13.084
And you were hoping to heal
Jane Galloway?

19:13.084 --> 19:16.020
I was only hoping
to comfort her.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.022
I'm bound by that obligation.

19:18.022 --> 19:20.692
So, these visions you
told us about earlier?

19:20.692 --> 19:24.329
These are the only ones
you've experienced?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.497
I have more.

19:26.497 --> 19:28.967
(inhaling)

19:28.967 --> 19:29.834
Locks.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.469
Three locks.

19:31.469 --> 19:34.739
Hanging... ghosts,
hanging ghosts.

19:34.739 --> 19:36.874
Chest to back, back to chest.

19:36.874 --> 19:39.344
A-frames, wooden beams,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.779
church dark.

19:41.779 --> 19:43.872
(sighs)

19:43.982 --> 19:46.780
That's it.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.168
Are these the three locks
you saw?

20:04.168 --> 20:08.272
Yeah... they-they seem
different, though.

20:08.272 --> 20:10.672
Perhaps it's the angle.

20:10.808 --> 20:11.909
What do you mean?

20:11.909 --> 20:17.711
It seemed...
I was looking down on them.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.900
Is this what
you saw?
Yes.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.202
Only it was...

20:38.202 --> 20:43.299
From above.

21:30.888 --> 21:34.881
(cell phone ringing)

21:38.096 --> 21:41.265
- Hello.
- Pick a number between two and five

21:41.265 --> 21:42.789
and indicate it
with your fingers.

21:43.801 --> 21:45.236
Why?

21:45.236 --> 21:47.534
Please, humor me.

21:51.242 --> 21:54.445
Four. Thank you.

21:54.445 --> 21:55.980
Where are you?

21:55.980 --> 21:56.614
Look up.

21:56.614 --> 22:01.711
Jane's bedroom closet
has a door to the attic.

22:45.963 --> 22:48.166
(phone rings)

22:48.166 --> 22:50.501
- Warrick. - Warrick, Grissom.

22:50.501 --> 22:52.570
You know that blond fiber
we were looking at?

22:52.570 --> 22:56.174
Fiberglass insulation...
comes in pink and yellow.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.441
But you already knew that.

22:57.441 --> 22:58.910
Is that why you're calling?

22:58.910 --> 23:02.213
Not really.
I was checking a phone line.

23:02.213 --> 23:03.414
But good work.

23:03.414 --> 23:05.349
Yeah.

23:05.349 --> 23:07.112
(grunts)

23:08.486 --> 23:11.189
Guess what. He tapped into her second

23:11.189 --> 23:14.358
And he's got a peephole
into every room.

23:14.358 --> 23:17.350
They're labeled.

23:21.132 --> 23:23.734
Uh... Gil, there's a, uh...

23:23.734 --> 23:27.338
Yeah. He's our psychic... Mr. Pearson.

23:27.338 --> 23:27.963
Right.

23:31.209 --> 23:33.578
You know, I don't
think this thing was about sex at all.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.414
I think it was about control...
voyeurism.

23:36.414 --> 23:40.084
Jane was like his,
uh... little goldfish.

23:40.084 --> 23:41.385
Then why kill her?

23:41.385 --> 23:46.880
And why... leave all this stuff behind?

23:47.658 --> 23:51.355
Interesting collection of toys.

23:53.831 --> 23:56.467
Digital camera...

23:56.467 --> 23:59.163
with a fiber-optic lens.

24:03.574 --> 24:06.475
Night-vision goggles.

24:12.450 --> 24:16.216
Digital recorder.

24:20.057 --> 24:23.661
I'm guessing he's got
microphones all over the house.

24:23.661 --> 24:24.962
Probably.

24:24.962 --> 24:25.663
(sighs)

24:25.663 --> 24:28.291
Same question...
how did he get in?

24:31.202 --> 24:34.330
Well, this only opens
from the inside.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.775
So, at some point,

24:37.775 --> 24:40.505
it's possible that Jane
let him in.

24:42.513 --> 24:45.778
Thank you.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.141
So...

24:47.251 --> 24:52.156
Who do we let into
our homes every day?

24:52.156 --> 24:54.358
Well,
pretty much, if you got
a uniform on,

24:54.358 --> 24:56.961
you can walk right in
the front door.

24:56.961 --> 24:58.829
So, we go through
her bills,

24:58.829 --> 25:02.287
and we see which utility companies
worked on her house.

25:08.205 --> 25:09.968
Hi, there.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.322
Luna Cable.

25:24.322 --> 25:27.155
Good company. Same as mine.

25:28.159 --> 25:29.293
150 channels.

25:29.293 --> 25:30.328
I'm telling you,
you got to get it, man.

25:30.328 --> 25:33.092
The last three weeks
have been
heaven.

25:35.066 --> 25:39.833
(knocking)

25:40.338 --> 25:42.306
Mr. Crane?

25:44.342 --> 25:46.043
Nick Stokes,
Criminalistics.

25:46.043 --> 25:49.880
(
cell phone rings)

25:49.880 --> 25:51.347
Hello.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.619
Hello? I...
I can't hear you.

25:55.619 --> 25:57.348
Hold on.

25:58.356 --> 26:00.347
Mr. Crane, your door's open.

26:01.359 --> 26:02.893
Just want to...

26:02.893 --> 26:04.662
ask you a couple questions.

26:04.662 --> 26:07.096
I can hardly hear you.

26:08.366 --> 26:12.325
We're at the, uh...
satellite guy's house that installed Jane's

26:51.108 --> 26:53.406
(rustling)

26:58.416 --> 26:59.678
Nick!

27:05.623 --> 27:07.024
Patrol.
Request immediate backup.

27:07.024 --> 27:08.959
Immediate backup.
Officer down

27:08.959 --> 27:15.387
I need emergency medical assistance,
826 Harris Lane! Nick!

27:16.434 --> 27:17.628
Nick.

27:28.412 --> 27:28.979
Concussion,

27:28.979 --> 27:29.780
two cracked ribs,

27:29.780 --> 27:32.650
sprained wrist,
five stitches to the forehead.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.413
It could have been a lot worse.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.821
- But he's going
to be all right? - He needs rest.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.790
But I don't see
why he can't go home relatively soon.

27:40.424 --> 27:41.448
Thank you, Doctor.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.689
Damn it.

27:45.129 --> 27:46.289
Grissom, this guy
was right there. I could have had him.

27:46.397 --> 27:47.331
You helped out Nick.

27:47.331 --> 27:48.999
That was the right thing to do.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.796
Doesn't feel
like the right thing.

27:50.968 --> 27:52.036
You know,
Nick was alone.

27:52.036 --> 27:55.437
The stalker could have
killed him and didn't.

27:55.739 --> 27:57.468
Yeah, I wonder why.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.643
Let's go back
over there.

27:59.643 --> 28:01.212
I'm going
with you.

28:01.212 --> 28:01.846
No, no.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.614
You need to calm down a little.

28:03.614 --> 28:06.048
Talk to Nick when he wakes up.

28:09.453 --> 28:11.455
Nigel Crane, age 37. No criminal record.

28:11.455 --> 28:14.458
Working for Luna Cable
for 11 years.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.494
No immediate family,
lives alone.

28:16.494 --> 28:19.463
Last seen by coworkers
two days ago.

28:19.463 --> 28:20.731
No priors.

28:20.731 --> 28:23.400
Not a stick of furniture...

28:23.400 --> 28:27.461
except for a computer
and a chair.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.352
(gasping)

29:48.352 --> 29:49.520
What the hell?!

29:49.520 --> 29:51.021
He lives up there.

29:51.021 --> 29:52.189
Not down here.

29:52.189 --> 29:55.593
Works, sleeps, changes his clothes...
everything in the attic.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.194
He looks down
on the world,

29:57.194 --> 29:59.063
separating himself
from others.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.565
Fascinating, really.

30:01.565 --> 30:02.566
Well...

30:02.566 --> 30:05.558
you're going to love this.

30:08.839 --> 30:10.240
Red dye.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.642
Yep.

30:11.642 --> 30:12.666
Now what?

30:14.578 --> 30:15.567
Dinner and a movie?

30:17.114 --> 30:18.582
Walking pukes.

30:18.582 --> 30:23.679
Soulless, lost, useless,
sick puppets.

30:24.588 --> 30:27.523
Little sheep
looking for direction.

30:28.892 --> 30:29.593
Gullible.

30:29.593 --> 30:37.625
From an airplane,
they used to look like ants.

30:38.135 --> 30:40.304
And now...

30:40.304 --> 30:44.308
they're all ants
all the time.

30:44.308 --> 30:46.208
You squash one.

30:49.647 --> 30:50.648
Well.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.249
Just think,
this is only tape one.

30:52.249 --> 30:56.987
They all start running around
in a panic.

30:56.987 --> 31:00.624
Now, these painkillers
are the real deal, okay?

31:00.624 --> 31:01.325
Don't overdo it.

31:01.325 --> 31:02.292
Plenty of rest.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.560
No work for
at least a week.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.495
Will do.
Thank you, Doctor.

31:07.598 --> 31:09.998
The gloves... you find them?

31:10.634 --> 31:12.932
Catherine thinks
he might have got away with them.

31:13.070 --> 31:16.640
But, uh...
Grissom did find some wacky video
collection.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.809
- Of what? - Now, did you not
just hear the doctor?

31:18.809 --> 31:21.642
You're supposed to rest. We're on it, okay?

31:21.679 --> 31:23.840
Yeah, relax, Iron side.

31:26.650 --> 31:27.674
I see you, Jane.

31:28.652 --> 31:30.020
Do you feel me?

31:30.020 --> 31:32.289
Do you feel me?

31:32.289 --> 31:36.393
(tape whirs forward)

31:36.393 --> 31:37.861
You...

31:37.861 --> 31:40.364
You will never get me.

31:40.364 --> 31:44.034
No. Not the way he does.

31:44.034 --> 31:48.300
And we all get what we deserve.

31:50.541 --> 31:50.708
I got a friend.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.539
And I...

31:53.110 --> 31:54.678
How's it going?

31:54.678 --> 31:56.669
How's Nick doing?

31:57.681 --> 31:58.943
Well, groggy.

31:59.216 --> 32:00.684
How's the epic?

32:00.684 --> 32:03.687
- Epic. - Gotten any clues as to where
this guy might be?

32:03.687 --> 32:05.382
Not really. Not yet.

32:08.692 --> 32:10.057
Archie, freeze it.

32:13.630 --> 32:14.722
Do you see that
behind him?

32:15.432 --> 32:17.457
To the left hand
of the screen?

32:17.768 --> 32:19.470
Can you focus the pixels?

32:19.470 --> 32:20.801
(typing)

32:24.842 --> 32:27.411
Okay, we're now
at 26 times magnification.

32:27.411 --> 32:30.676
Rendering
at 1086 lines.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.586
That's the Crime Stopper article.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.755
Isn't our newsletter

32:37.755 --> 32:39.723
for in-house only?

32:39.723 --> 32:40.991
Do you think he knows Nick?

32:40.991 --> 32:43.494
He may know him well enough
to read his e-mail.

32:43.494 --> 32:46.330
Found that photo
of Nick and his prom date.

32:46.330 --> 32:49.766
Used Jane Galloway
to emulate the photo?

32:50.134 --> 32:51.802
Why would he do that?

32:51.802 --> 32:52.469
Why Nick?

32:52.469 --> 32:54.767
Nick has satellite cable, right?

32:55.339 --> 32:57.933
Lunar Cable... 150 channels.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.111
Wait a minute. We've been doing this
the wrong way.

33:01.111 --> 33:03.180
We need to see the last tape.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.205
(shuffling tapes)

33:07.785 --> 33:09.116
Archie, play this.

33:13.257 --> 33:14.958
It's like he... he's...

33:14.958 --> 33:20.731
he's the kind of guy
I always wanted to, um... to be.

33:20.731 --> 33:23.700
And that's why it's
so great, because...

33:24.301 --> 33:25.636
we're friends now.

33:25.636 --> 33:29.139
I feel like I can count on him,
you know?

33:29.139 --> 33:29.807
And you know what?

33:29.807 --> 33:31.675
I think,
if it came right down to it,

33:31.675 --> 33:36.169
he would lay his life down
for me.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.281
Ask him.

33:37.281 --> 33:40.250
A... a... ask... ask Nick.

33:43.020 --> 33:43.821
Nick,

33:43.821 --> 33:47.086
would you let me
stop your heart?

34:07.211 --> 34:09.873
(knocking at door)

34:13.449 --> 34:14.184
Who is it?

34:14.184 --> 34:16.846
My name is Pearson.
Morris Pearson.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.856
We haven't met. I worked with
Mr. Grissom on the Jane
Galloway case.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.386
It's almost 1:00 in the morning.

34:27.397 --> 34:30.366
- What do you want? - I've had more

34:30.400 --> 34:32.594
Please let me in.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.742
Yeah, maybe
but look...
Please, please
let me in.

34:38.742 --> 34:39.842
I can't just
let you in my...
Please, please, please...

34:39.842 --> 34:40.878
Hey, hold up.
I saw this house.

34:40.878 --> 34:42.346
I saw this house,
I saw the number,

34:42.346 --> 34:43.313
I saw the street name.

34:43.313 --> 34:44.313
Something
is wrong here.

34:44.313 --> 34:46.550
Something terrible
is going to happen here

34:46.550 --> 34:46.884
Sir...
I can feel it.

34:46.884 --> 34:47.951
You're going
to have to leave.

34:47.951 --> 34:49.085
Please, please,
listen to me.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.884
Get out of here.
Listen to me!

34:53.456 --> 34:54.658
I saw the address.

34:54.658 --> 34:56.888
I saw this
address.

34:57.828 --> 34:59.029
You saw
my
address?

34:59.029 --> 35:00.931
Yeah, but that's not it.
That's not it.

35:00.931 --> 35:02.099
I saw, I saw...

35:02.099 --> 35:04.268
I saw crashing.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.535
I saw...

35:05.535 --> 35:07.070
falling and
crashing... I saw

35:07.070 --> 35:09.406
somebody seeing
through the back of his head.

35:09.406 --> 35:12.242
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know...

35:12.242 --> 35:13.641
Green tea.

35:13.877 --> 35:14.945
Green tea.

35:14.945 --> 35:17.814
Does that mean anything to you?
Green tea?

35:17.814 --> 35:18.882
I don't know.

35:18.882 --> 35:20.474
(phone rings)

35:24.821 --> 35:26.379
Just...

35:28.458 --> 35:29.092
Hello.

35:29.092 --> 35:31.995
- Nick, listen.
He's been in your house. - Who?

35:31.995 --> 35:33.931
Nigel Crane... the stalker.

35:33.931 --> 35:36.066
Brass is one his way with two uniforms
to put at your door.

35:36.066 --> 35:37.434
Yeah, well, I'm not alone.

35:37.434 --> 35:38.268
What?

35:38.268 --> 35:39.536
Your psychic's here.

35:39.536 --> 35:42.198
Good. Keep him there.

35:45.275 --> 35:47.266
Mr. Pearson.

35:52.282 --> 35:53.650
(gun cocking)

35:53.650 --> 35:56.881
Mr. Pearson.

36:21.578 --> 36:23.914
Mr. Pearson...

36:23.914 --> 36:26.644
you back here?

36:33.590 --> 36:35.990
(thumping)

36:47.337 --> 36:49.965
(footsteps)

37:12.529 --> 37:15.225
(coughing)

37:21.004 --> 37:23.029
Oh, man. You got to...

37:23.140 --> 37:25.074
You got to watch
who you let in here.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.307
Guy was snooping around
all over the place.

37:30.313 --> 37:32.916
You know, smart move.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.184
Spare gun.

37:34.184 --> 37:34.818
Ah.

37:34.818 --> 37:37.054
Keep it right
by the phone, right?

37:37.054 --> 37:40.524
Right next to your address book
and... and take-out menus.

37:40.524 --> 37:41.958
Cops are on their way.

37:41.958 --> 37:42.826
Yeah.

37:42.826 --> 37:44.555
I heard that.

37:48.698 --> 37:50.600
You wearing my clothes?

37:50.600 --> 37:52.002
Oh, yeah.

37:52.002 --> 37:52.969
I am.

37:52.969 --> 37:53.804
(deep exhale)

37:53.804 --> 37:57.407
You know, I-I-I picked
these up at the dry cleaners,

37:57.407 --> 37:59.042
and I... I hope you
don't mind.

37:59.042 --> 38:01.044
It's just that...
I'm sorry.

38:01.044 --> 38:03.747
I, I just get a little confused

38:03.747 --> 38:07.684
about what's yours
and what's mine.

38:07.684 --> 38:08.452
You know what?

38:08.452 --> 38:10.420
I'm a little confused
here myself.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.089
Uh... why don't you
refresh my memory?

38:12.089 --> 38:13.420
When did we meet?

38:16.193 --> 38:18.061
Sports package.

38:18.061 --> 38:20.052
150 channels.

38:20.097 --> 38:23.567
I-I-I even threw in
a few movie channels. Free.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.869
We talked, like, forever.

38:25.869 --> 38:29.206
I mean, it's like
I knew you my entire life.

38:29.206 --> 38:33.108
- You installed my cable. - Yeah.

38:34.111 --> 38:37.808
The... the minute
I met you, I knew we connected.

38:38.014 --> 38:40.851
Because you told me
what you did,

38:40.851 --> 38:41.585
and I knew exactly

38:41.585 --> 38:43.587
what you were talking
about, because...

38:43.587 --> 38:44.654
that's what I do.

38:44.654 --> 38:45.522
I do it, too.

38:45.522 --> 38:47.357
You know, I observe people.

38:47.357 --> 38:52.095
I-I-I notice everything
about them. I watch them.

38:52.095 --> 38:52.857
All the time.

38:53.096 --> 38:55.997
Like you watched
Jane Galloway?

38:56.099 --> 38:57.167
Jane was cool.

38:57.167 --> 39:02.472
But, um... it would have never worked out
between us, you know. Never.

39:02.472 --> 39:03.106
I mean, she had
a boyfriend,

39:03.106 --> 39:04.708
and she was
kind of stuck up.

39:04.708 --> 39:08.872
And you know what?
She would have totally, totally
gotten between us.

39:09.112 --> 39:15.118
So, you know,
consider that a gift.

39:15.118 --> 39:17.313
- A gift? - Yeah.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.289
Prom night.

39:19.289 --> 39:20.757
Your date.

39:20.757 --> 39:22.554
Melissa.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.164
Bent over the toilet,
puking her guts out.

39:27.164 --> 39:30.734
Is that ringing any bells, huh?

39:30.734 --> 39:31.334
Yeah.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.170
You know, I mean,
Jane's hair

39:33.170 --> 39:35.005
was the wrong color
but, you know,

39:35.005 --> 39:36.439
obviously, I fixed that.

39:36.439 --> 39:41.411
Because I know how much
you love redheads.

39:41.411 --> 39:43.380
You know, you...

39:43.380 --> 39:47.184
You mentioned her name
in your sleep.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.448
You watch me sleep?

39:53.523 --> 39:55.013
You, um...

39:55.759 --> 39:58.161
You want to open him up?

39:58.161 --> 39:59.329
Hmm?

39:59.329 --> 40:03.356
No, no,
it's, uh... It's not my job.

40:03.466 --> 40:05.202
You should know that.

40:05.202 --> 40:06.937
It's the coroner's gig.

40:06.937 --> 40:10.207
- Are you humoring me, Nick? - No.

40:10.207 --> 40:11.641
You know...

40:11.641 --> 40:14.444
We made friends that day

40:14.444 --> 40:16.980
and, every time since,

40:16.980 --> 40:21.084
you just blew me off.

40:21.084 --> 40:23.353
Do you know that?

40:23.353 --> 40:26.288
You just completely blanked me.

40:28.225 --> 40:31.194
You are so self-absorbed.

40:32.896 --> 40:36.332
I was right in front
of your face.

40:38.201 --> 40:41.071
Manners, Nick!

40:41.071 --> 40:42.239
Manners!

40:42.239 --> 40:44.341
Now, Nigel, now,
we got a DB here, huh?

40:44.341 --> 40:46.977
You're going to help me with
the crime scene, right?

40:46.977 --> 40:48.078
No, no. I'm going to...

40:48.078 --> 40:50.647
I'm going to give you
a brand-new one.

40:50.647 --> 40:52.082
I'm going to do
better than that.

40:52.082 --> 40:55.285
I'm going to give you
the best you ever had.

40:55.285 --> 40:56.987
Stand up, Nick.

40:56.987 --> 40:57.687
Stand up.

40:57.687 --> 41:02.259
Nick, you know what
a nine-millimeter slug

41:02.259 --> 41:03.593
does to a skull at close range?

41:03.593 --> 41:04.828
You know?

41:04.828 --> 41:07.230
Yeah.
Blow it right
apart, right?

41:07.230 --> 41:09.499
Brains like
strawberry swirled.

41:09.499 --> 41:12.269
Whipped cream everywhere. And you...

41:12.269 --> 41:15.238
You'd have to scoop
that stuff up, right?

41:15.238 --> 41:19.342
Yeah, little pieces of
skull and bone and brains,

41:19.342 --> 41:24.614
all in individual baggies with
the victim's name on the label.

41:24.614 --> 41:27.117
You know, I don't want
to disappoint you, Nigel,

41:27.117 --> 41:32.521
but this isn't the first time
I've had a gun in my face.

41:33.890 --> 41:38.028
How do you want
this to end, Nigel?

41:38.028 --> 41:39.796
How do I want this to end?

41:39.796 --> 41:44.801
I want you to be able
to remember my name.

41:44.801 --> 41:47.370
(grunting and gunshots)

41:47.370 --> 41:48.371
Gun!

41:48.371 --> 41:49.963
Get down! Get down!

41:51.841 --> 41:53.832
Put him down.

41:54.844 --> 41:56.709
Cuff him.

41:58.214 --> 41:59.049
Hey.

41:59.049 --> 42:00.684
(
breathing heavy
)

42:00.684 --> 42:02.218
It's... it's done.

42:02.218 --> 42:03.787
All right, yeah.

42:03.787 --> 42:05.722
I am one, and who am I?

42:05.722 --> 42:06.890
I am one,
and who am I?

42:06.890 --> 42:09.993
I am one,
and who am I?

42:09.993 --> 42:12.329
I am one, and who am I?

42:12.329 --> 42:14.764
I am one,
and who am I?

42:14.764 --> 42:16.666
I am one, and who am I?

42:16.666 --> 42:18.668
I am one,
and who am I?

42:18.668 --> 42:20.226
Why me?

42:22.339 --> 42:24.941
I don't think
it was about you, Nick.

42:24.941 --> 42:27.410
Or Jane Galloway,
for that matter.

42:27.410 --> 42:31.548
I think it was
more about Maslow's Hierarchy
of Needs.

42:31.548 --> 42:36.486
His premise is that social
beings strive to belong.

42:36.486 --> 42:37.320
In Nigel's mind,

42:37.320 --> 42:39.422
Jane Galloway
was someone
he could control,

42:39.422 --> 42:40.924
which was okay
for a while,

42:40.924 --> 42:41.558
but you...

42:41.558 --> 42:44.686
you were someone he
could actually become.

42:45.328 --> 42:49.599
See, Maslow's
fifth tier of the Hierarchy
is Self-Actualization.

42:49.599 --> 42:50.700
I am one, and who am I?

42:50.700 --> 42:52.869
The problem for Nigel
is that you would

42:52.869 --> 42:55.138
have to die in order
for that to happen.

42:55.138 --> 42:57.971
Or else he would.

43:03.346 --> 43:05.849
25 years to life, Nick.

43:05.849 --> 43:07.612
It's over.

43:08.585 --> 43:12.455
It's not over for me.

43:12.455 --> 43:15.447
It's over for Jane Galloway.

43:17.427 --> 43:21.363
Well, we should
get back to the lab.

43:23.066 --> 43:24.795
Yeah.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.042
I am one, and who am I?

43:33.042 --> 43:35.245
I am one,
and who am I?

43:35.245 --> 43:37.180
I am one, and who am I?

43:37.180 --> 43:39.282
I am one,
and who am I?

43:39.282 --> 43:42.752
I am one, and who am I?

43:42.752 --> 43:45.243
And who am I?
