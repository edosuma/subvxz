02:34.227 --> 02:36.718
<i>One of the first things
my grandfather taught me</i>

02:36.796 --> 02:38.354
<i>was about the American dream.</i>

02:38.431 --> 02:40.331
<i>To some folks, he said,
it's staying at home,</i>

02:40.400 --> 02:42.129
<i>watching the grandchildren
grow up.</i>

02:42.202 --> 02:45.000
<i>To others it's traveling
to exotic, faraway lands.</i>

02:45.071 --> 02:47.437
<i>To some it's owning
fancy cars and big houses.</i>

02:47.507 --> 02:49.270
<i>But one thing was for certain.</i>

02:49.342 --> 02:51.902
<i>Whatever their version
of the American dream,</i>

02:51.978 --> 02:55.778
<i>a lot of people were willing to
go to great lengths to get it.</i>

03:12.365 --> 03:14.299
Hey! Hey!

03:37.524 --> 03:40.015
<i>All right, we're in business!</i>

03:40.093 --> 03:42.220
<i>Yeah, we did it, man.
We did it.</i>

03:43.630 --> 03:44.824
<i>All right, yeah.</i>

03:44.898 --> 03:47.025
You never said we were gonna go steal a car.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.727
<i>Well, what did you think
we were gonna do?</i>

03:48.802 --> 03:51.066
You said we were gonna go
pick one up for your uncle.

03:51.137 --> 03:52.764
I didn't mean a real uncle.

03:52.839 --> 03:54.170
<i>You gonna help us, or what?</i>

03:54.241 --> 03:56.869
<i>You lied to me, Ray.
Hey, cut it out, man.</i>

03:56.943 --> 03:59.036
<i>Hey, come on.
Take it easy.</i>

04:06.219 --> 04:07.550
I'm getting out of here.

04:07.621 --> 04:09.714
Nobody held a gun to your head.

04:12.392 --> 04:14.553
<i>My own definition
of the American dream</i>

04:14.628 --> 04:16.619
<i>changed a lot over the years.</i>

04:16.696 --> 04:19.563
<i>First there was playing
baseball for the Detroit Tigers.</i>

04:19.632 --> 04:21.260
<i>By the time I left for Vietnam,</i>

04:21.334 --> 04:24.201
<i>that had changed to a wife,
a house, and a family,</i>

04:24.271 --> 04:26.796
<i>and I knew that's what life
had in store for me,</i>

04:26.873 --> 04:28.773
<i>because everybody
was supposed to get</i>

04:28.842 --> 04:31.333
<i>their version of
the American dream.</i>

04:31.945 --> 04:33.537
<i>Look, it was great
meeting you, but...</i>

04:33.613 --> 04:35.137
What about coming
to the club tonight?

04:35.215 --> 04:36.204
I don't know. I...

04:36.283 --> 04:37.944
You said you didn't
have anything to do.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.043
<i>That isn't what I said
exactly. All right, all right.</i>

04:40.120 --> 04:43.647
<i>All right, you said you were
gonna go to the hotel and watch TV.</i>

04:43.723 --> 04:45.350
The flight to LA
is a long flight.

04:45.425 --> 04:48.121
<i>Now, I've got all this business
to take care of tomorrow, and...</i>

04:48.194 --> 04:49.422
I don't know.

04:49.496 --> 04:51.726
<i>But nothing absolutely,
positively urgent tonight?</i>

04:51.798 --> 04:53.766
<i>No, nothing urgent. No.</i>

04:53.833 --> 04:57.030
<i>Well, you're going to miss
a great opportunity</i>

04:57.103 --> 05:00.072
for a truly spontaneous
good time.

05:03.009 --> 05:06.069
<i>I bet you're the kind of guy who could
never just say, "Aw, what the hell."</i>

05:06.146 --> 05:07.943
I do. Sometimes.

05:08.014 --> 05:09.311
You can miss out
on a lot in life

05:09.382 --> 05:12.180
<i>unless you're willing to say,
"Aw, what the hell."</i>

05:19.459 --> 05:21.120
<i>Little old for you, isn't he?</i>

05:21.194 --> 05:22.320
Yeah.

05:22.395 --> 05:24.955
<i>Yeah, he's probably 40
if he's a day.</i>

05:26.966 --> 05:29.332
<i>Oh, that's my suitcase.
Could you get that?</i>

05:29.402 --> 05:31.529
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, just get that.</i>

05:33.173 --> 05:34.265
Thanks.

05:34.341 --> 05:38.573
My mom got this for me the first time
I came to LA to make the big time.

05:38.645 --> 05:40.442
<i>Last chance, say yes.</i>

05:41.114 --> 05:43.344
A truly spontaneous good time?

05:45.018 --> 05:47.543
We'll grab a cab. That
way you won't get lost.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.884
Come on. Come on.

05:57.434 --> 05:59.452
I gonna have to owe you for my cab fare

05:59.531 --> 06:01.457
because I don't get paid until tomorrow

06:01.491 --> 06:02.758
I have a rental car.

06:03.666 --> 06:04.542
Great.

06:04.566 --> 06:05.566
Excuse me.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.377
Diamond Car Rental.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.320
Let's go.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.070
<i>One, two, three.
Tigers!</i>

06:16.142 --> 06:19.236
<i>All right!
Let's go, let's go.</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:22.776
<i>Hey, Kenny, Kenny, where's Ray?</i>

06:23.583 --> 06:24.880
I don't know.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.977
You don't know? You guys
go everywhere together.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.249
Mark. Mark. Get out there
and take Ray's place.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.915
<i>Let's do, Mark.
Let's go, buddy.</i>

06:33.459 --> 06:36.292
<i>Kenny, I want to talk to you after the game.</i>

06:37.096 --> 06:38.620
Play ball!

06:39.832 --> 06:43.097
<i>Higgins, this is great. We did
$325 just in gate receipts alone.</i>

06:43.169 --> 06:45.933
I'm sure the Anglo-Hawaiian
Home for Incorrigible Boys

06:46.005 --> 06:47.495
will be most gratified.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.040
<i>I know I said
that we'd make a killing,</i>

06:49.108 --> 06:50.507
but you gotta admit one thing.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.875
<i>Hey, has Ray Kalama been up here
getting free candy bars again?</i>

06:53.946 --> 06:55.345
Who?
Ray Kalama.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.178
He's my best hitter.
He plays third base.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.018
<i>"He's... You know,
5'7", dark wavy hair.</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:05.489
<i>Oh, yes. He's the one who made
off with our entire allotment</i>

07:05.558 --> 07:07.526
of jujubes last year.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.562
He was having a rough time.
He's doing better this year.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.063
<i>No, I haven't seen him.</i>

07:12.131 --> 07:14.656
<i>They're not gonna be real happy
down at the halfway house, T. C.,</i>

07:14.734 --> 07:16.224
if he doesn't show up.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.167
He'll be here.
Foul ball! Strike two!

07:18.237 --> 07:19.431
<i>All right, hey, let's go!</i>

07:19.505 --> 07:20.529
I gotta get back to my seat.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.403
<i>It's too bad you gotta
fill in for Thomas, Higgins.</i>

07:22.475 --> 07:23.703
You're gonna miss
the whole game.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.211
<i>Well, I suppose
when Mr. Masters calls,</i>

07:27.280 --> 07:29.214
we must all sacrifice.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.210
<i>So where did Thomas go,
anyway? Hot dogs. Peanuts.</i>

07:32.285 --> 07:34.048
Get your red-hots here.
Bali?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.678
Hotdogs. Peanuts.
Morocco?

07:35.755 --> 07:37.222
Get your red-hots here.
South of France?

07:43.029 --> 07:46.362
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Marti Jensen!</i>

07:49.769 --> 07:51.862
<i>Thank you.
Thank you.</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:54.497
<i>Don't you just love nighttime?</i>

07:54.574 --> 07:56.565
<i>See, I was born a night person.</i>

07:56.642 --> 07:58.405
<i>Literally. See,
I was born at midnight,</i>

07:58.478 --> 08:01.106
<i>and I just naturally thought,
well, that's when the day began.</i>

08:02.415 --> 08:06.249
<i>So there I was, five. I was
already a nighttime junkie,</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:08.685
<i>and I used to sneak down
the stairs to the basement</i>

08:08.754 --> 08:10.779
<i>where my dad
had this portable TV,</i>

08:10.857 --> 08:14.452
<i>and watch Night Owl Theater.</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:19.591
<i>So there I was, sitting three inches
away from the television screen</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:22.065
<i>so I could keep
the sound down low</i>

08:22.935 --> 08:24.698
<i>when I saw the movie</i>

08:25.938 --> 08:28.338
<i>that probably changed my life.</i>

08:30.176 --> 08:31.837
<i>Hookers in Hell!</i>

08:33.813 --> 08:37.442
<i>Lila, why do you always
give her the 8:15 slot?</i>

08:37.517 --> 08:39.883
Because she makes me laugh.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.121
<i>You saw it, too!</i>

08:44.390 --> 08:46.722
<i>Well, for those
of you who didn't,</i>

08:46.792 --> 08:49.818
<i>Hookers in Hell is an opera
about a psychopathic killer</i>

08:49.896 --> 08:52.865
<i>who hunts down all the hookers in Hollywood</i>

08:52.932 --> 08:55.230
<i>and stabs them to death.</i>

08:56.903 --> 08:58.803
<i>It's kind of like a comedy.</i>

09:00.706 --> 09:03.004
<i>And it goes something like this.</i>

09:15.955 --> 09:18.423
The hookers. Hooker one.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.630
<i>Where are you going?</i>

09:36.108 --> 09:37.871
<i>Look out behind you.</i>

09:38.878 --> 09:40.675
<i>They're coming after us.</i>

09:40.746 --> 09:42.714
<i>What do we do now?</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:45.683
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:45.751 --> 09:47.446
<i>But I have a funny feeling.</i>

09:47.520 --> 09:49.488
<i>We're in trouble!</i>

11:53.905 --> 11:55.851
Don't you ever get scared up there?

11:55.993 --> 11:58.055
Who? Me? Never.

11:58.159 --> 11:59.528
Being alone on the road,

11:59.568 --> 12:02.938
it's the only time I feel truly alive.

12:03.676 --> 12:05.610
You ought to try it sometime.

12:05.666 --> 12:08.432
Not a chance. Thanks for
the tip on the pizza.

12:08.685 --> 12:10.285
Mind expanding isn't it?

12:10.371 --> 12:11.704
Something like that.

12:15.111 --> 12:17.122
What a week.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.998
<i>I mean,
I win this trip to Hawaii,</i>

12:20.536 --> 12:23.664
<i>and then Lila gives me
the 8:15 spot,</i>

12:24.307 --> 12:28.539
and then you come around
and buy me a deluxe

12:28.611 --> 12:32.103
combination kitchen-sink
pizza from Signorelli's.

12:32.181 --> 12:34.979
<i>I mean, my life is complete.</i>

12:36.452 --> 12:37.544
Well.

12:39.288 --> 12:40.755
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

12:40.823 --> 12:42.791
Where do you get your energy?

12:42.859 --> 12:44.759
I better take you home.

12:45.595 --> 12:48.086
<i>No, that's okay.
I mean, you could...</i>

12:48.164 --> 12:50.826
<i>It's a long drive, and you're
tired. No, I'm not that tired.</i>

12:50.900 --> 12:52.731
<i>Well, I meant with the
time zone change and all.</i>

12:52.802 --> 12:54.326
It's three hours
earlier in Hawaii.

12:54.404 --> 12:55.837
<i>Oh, right.</i>

12:55.905 --> 12:57.270
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

12:58.207 --> 13:01.643
Couldn't I just stay here?
I could sleep on your sofa.

13:01.811 --> 13:04.905
I hate to go home alone
by myself late at night.

13:06.315 --> 13:09.250
I'll stay right here
on your sofa. And...

13:09.318 --> 13:10.979
And I don't snore.

13:11.521 --> 13:14.922
<i>Well, not very loud, anyway.</i>

13:16.492 --> 13:17.720
Please?

13:17.927 --> 13:22.125
<i>Look, I know when you get older
you need your own space and things.</i>

13:22.198 --> 13:24.029
<i>Oh, I'm not that old.</i>

13:24.934 --> 13:27.425
I'll get you a blanket.
You mean it?

13:40.149 --> 13:41.480
All right.

13:43.653 --> 13:47.453
You take the bedroom and
I'm gonna sleep on the couch.

13:48.157 --> 13:50.091
You're gonna give me the bed?

13:50.159 --> 13:52.787
<i>Well, it's the least
I can do. I had a...</i>

13:53.896 --> 13:55.989
truly spontaneous good time.

13:56.332 --> 13:57.526
Thanks.

13:59.936 --> 14:01.335
Sleep tight.

14:33.236 --> 14:35.761
<i>Look out behind you.</i>

15:00.263 --> 15:01.457
Marti?

15:03.799 --> 15:04.959
Marti?

15:20.983 --> 15:22.143
Marti?

15:34.330 --> 15:35.490
Marti?

15:51.547 --> 15:53.037
Marti.

16:07.563 --> 16:10.361
<i>I had an idea that Marti's
version of the American dream</i>

16:10.441 --> 16:12.737
<i>included fame and fortune.</i>

16:13.135 --> 16:16.161
<i>I wondered why the turn in
the road had brought her here.</i>

16:16.238 --> 16:19.105
McKEE: Where's the P.I.
That called this in?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.838
Private investigator.

16:23.646 --> 16:25.910
Thomas Magnum.
Detective McKee.

16:26.615 --> 16:28.276
Did you get a make
on the guy that did this?

16:28.350 --> 16:31.080
The perpetrator escaped before
the witness could get a good look.

16:34.723 --> 16:37.248
Any idea why he didn't stick
around to take care of you?

16:37.326 --> 16:40.762
<i>If you mean, was he after me?
No one even knew I was in LA.</i>

16:40.829 --> 16:43.320
I got a full report
while we were waiting.

16:43.399 --> 16:46.095
<i>I came in. I heard a noise
outside, I ran to the window,</i>

16:46.168 --> 16:48.159
I saw this car pulling away.
It's in the report.

16:48.237 --> 16:49.932
That's all you got?

16:50.005 --> 16:51.233
That's all.

16:51.307 --> 16:52.831
Okay.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.432
<i>Be sure to let us know
where you are,</i>

16:54.510 --> 16:57.001
in case we need to
get in touch with you.

16:57.980 --> 17:00.175
Any sign of struggle?
There were no shells.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.149
It's probably a revolver.

17:02.217 --> 17:04.185
<i>Why don't you find yourself
another hotel room, pal?</i>

17:04.252 --> 17:05.948
We're about to
seal this one off.

17:06.021 --> 17:08.615
<i>McKEE: Skin, hair?
Anything like that?</i>

17:08.790 --> 17:10.190
<i>No, sir.</i>

17:17.465 --> 17:18.933
What are you doing to find him?

17:19.001 --> 17:21.333
You're assuming
he's still alive.

17:22.271 --> 17:23.704
What do you assume?

17:23.771 --> 17:26.002
He hasn't been seen
since the shooting.

17:26.075 --> 17:27.473
That's not a good sign.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.477
What the hell
would he be doing here?

17:29.545 --> 17:31.672
<i>Hey, I know you're
close to these kids.</i>

17:31.747 --> 17:33.271
<i>Yeah, but he isn't
into that kind of stuff.</i>

17:33.349 --> 17:35.408
Not Kenny.
You never know.

17:35.517 --> 17:37.712
<i>Look, your father deserts you
when you're a baby...</i>

17:37.786 --> 17:39.481
<i>Hey, a lot of kids
come from broken homes.</i>

17:39.555 --> 17:42.217
That doesn't mean they get
involved with stuff like this.

17:42.291 --> 17:45.260
<i>Okay, okay. So what are
you doing to find him?</i>

17:45.694 --> 17:47.321
The only trail we have
at the moment

17:47.396 --> 17:48.863
is a rival chop shop gang.

17:48.931 --> 17:51.695
<i>Oh, so you think they'd
use murder as a warning.</i>

17:51.767 --> 17:53.132
That's all we have.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.136
<i>Look, the administrator
of the halfway house</i>

17:55.204 --> 17:56.933
said he thought Kenny
would come to you.

17:57.006 --> 17:59.372
<i>Frankly,
I don't hold out much hope.</i>

17:59.441 --> 18:00.840
But if you should
hear from him...

18:00.909 --> 18:03.400
I'm not gonna wait
for him to find me.

18:03.479 --> 18:07.040
<i>Hey, T. C., these guys knew
what they were doing.</i>

18:07.116 --> 18:09.676
<i>Missing Persons got an APB out,</i>

18:09.752 --> 18:14.018
but my gut feeling is we won't ever
see Kenny or the shooters again.

18:14.089 --> 18:15.954
<i>Well, I think we will.</i>

18:23.932 --> 18:25.229
And cut!

18:25.300 --> 18:27.962
<i>Looking good. It's looking real good, guys.</i>

18:28.137 --> 18:29.263
<i>John, did we get that?</i>

18:29.338 --> 18:30.464
<i>A thing of beauty, boss.</i>

18:30.539 --> 18:32.473
<i>That's a print!
Let's move on, boys.</i>

18:32.541 --> 18:34.338
<i>All right, you heard him,
boys, you heard him.</i>

18:34.410 --> 18:35.809
<i>Next setup, please.
Let's move.</i>

18:35.878 --> 18:38.506
<i>All right, atmosphere,
over by the van.</i>

18:41.283 --> 18:42.910
I said atmosphere
over by the van.

18:42.985 --> 18:44.850
<i>Oh. No, I'm not.
I'm looking for a friend.</i>

18:44.920 --> 18:46.353
Then you better
try the telephone.

18:46.422 --> 18:47.616
You know how you extras are.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.624
Cindy Farrell. Her office
said I could find her here.

18:49.692 --> 18:51.353
Then you're not one of the extras? No.

18:51.427 --> 18:53.054
<i>Ralph, where are my extras?</i>

18:53.128 --> 18:56.097
<i>Right away, right away. Why
do you want to see our lawyer?</i>

18:56.165 --> 18:58.030
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,</i>

18:58.100 --> 19:00.159
<i>Cindy and I were
high school sweethearts,</i>

19:00.235 --> 19:02.760
and we kind of lost track
of each other over the years.

19:02.838 --> 19:05.204
I don't know. I got this business trip to LA.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.674
<i>And I thought...
I know this sounds corny,</i>

19:07.743 --> 19:11.679
it really sounds corny but
I just wanted to say hi.

19:11.747 --> 19:13.874
<i>See how she was doing,
you know, and...</i>

19:13.949 --> 19:15.917
Okay. What did you say
your name was again?

19:15.984 --> 19:17.747
Howard Wescott.
Okay.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.549
Why don't you wait right there.

19:19.621 --> 19:20.986
Thank you.

19:40.876 --> 19:42.867
Hi.
Hello.

19:42.945 --> 19:44.242
<i>You are Cynthia Farrell,
aren't you?</i>

19:44.313 --> 19:46.873
<i>People, I said over by the van. Yes.</i>

19:46.949 --> 19:48.940
I think this belongs to you.

19:49.017 --> 19:50.507
<i>Oh, damn it!</i>

19:50.686 --> 19:52.381
How did you know about Howard?

19:52.454 --> 19:54.217
Professional secret.

19:54.456 --> 19:56.321
<i>I manage to elude
four process servers,</i>

19:56.391 --> 19:59.827
and they send you in with a
story about Howard Wescott.

19:59.895 --> 20:03.331
<i>Well, thank you, Miss Farrell.</i>

20:04.700 --> 20:07.635
<i>Well, I'm not gonna
take this lying down.</i>

20:07.703 --> 20:10.035
I intend to fight. That's entirely up to you.

20:10.105 --> 20:11.629
All the way.

20:11.707 --> 20:14.801
<i>And believe me, playboy,
jet-setter Robin Masters</i>

20:14.877 --> 20:16.970
<i>is gonna come out on the losing
side, Look, Miss Farrell...</i>

20:17.045 --> 20:18.706
not just in the courts
but in the press

20:18.781 --> 20:20.681
and in the hearts and minds
of Americans everywhere.

20:20.749 --> 20:23.217
The hearts and minds? When they
find out that multimillionaire.

20:23.285 --> 20:25.480
<i>Robin Masters is trying
to put this small,</i>

20:25.587 --> 20:27.282
struggling movie company...
They stole his book!

20:27.356 --> 20:28.380
That's his opinion.

20:28.457 --> 20:30.891
And anybody else's who can read.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.921
<i>Don't you dare
get patronizing with me,</i>

20:33.996 --> 20:38.126
<i>you conniving, double-talking civil servant!</i>

20:38.667 --> 20:40.134
Civil servant?
Yeah!

20:40.202 --> 20:41.692
<i>I'm not a civil servant, lady.</i>

20:41.770 --> 20:43.431
I just deliver the papers.

20:43.505 --> 20:45.973
You wanna behave like some
hysterical three-year-old that...

20:46.041 --> 20:50.273
<i>Oh, hysterical? Don't you
dare call me hys... terical.</i>

21:12.267 --> 21:14.963
<i>Hey, come on.
We're having a fight here.</i>

21:17.773 --> 21:18.797
Oh.

21:22.878 --> 21:24.539
Is something wrong?

21:25.714 --> 21:27.807
No. No. It's...

21:32.354 --> 21:33.446
smog.

21:39.228 --> 21:41.958
You were accusing me
of being hysterical.

21:42.831 --> 21:45.026
It kind of runs in the family.

21:45.901 --> 21:49.064
<i>Well, it's... It was a dirty
trick, pretending to be...</i>

21:49.137 --> 21:50.365
Howard.

21:51.273 --> 21:52.467
Howard.
Yeah.

21:57.479 --> 21:58.605
Well.

22:04.219 --> 22:05.481
Goodbye.

22:08.757 --> 22:11.191
I knew I should have
stayed home today.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.228
I already checked there.

22:14.997 --> 22:16.760
That's what I meant.

22:43.844 --> 22:45.710
Please fasten your seatbelt.

22:49.424 --> 22:51.298
Your door is ajar.

23:03.818 --> 23:06.884
Please check to see that
all doors are locked.

23:24.248 --> 23:25.381
Where's the horn?

23:27.027 --> 23:29.361
Your windshield wiper fluid is low.

23:29.537 --> 23:31.604
Just tell me where the horn is.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.513
I can't believe I'm talking to a car.

23:43.435 --> 23:47.303
<i>I'd always thought
of LA as the city of dreams.</i>

23:47.373 --> 23:50.308
<i>The place you go when you want
your fantasies to come true.</i>

23:50.376 --> 23:52.810
<i>Apparently 10 million
other people agreed with me.</i>

23:52.878 --> 23:54.709
<i>Some of those dreams
must have come true,</i>

23:54.780 --> 23:56.270
<i>but I couldn't help but notice</i>

23:56.348 --> 23:57.975
<i>that too many others
had been buried</i>

23:58.050 --> 24:00.644
<i>beneath the smog
and the congested freeways</i>

24:00.719 --> 24:03.916
<i>of a city that had
sprawled out of control.</i>

24:37.823 --> 24:40.519
<i>I didn't know if Marti's
dreams had come true.</i>

24:40.592 --> 24:43.891
<i>And maybe that's why
I couldn't just walk away.</i>

24:43.962 --> 24:45.827
<i>I hardly knew her,
but I couldn't let her</i>

24:45.898 --> 24:47.695
<i>become just another
forgotten case</i>

24:47.766 --> 24:50.496
<i>in an overworked
police detective's file.</i>

25:03.482 --> 25:05.279
<i>Goodbye.
Bye, man.</i>

25:17.329 --> 25:19.456
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

25:21.900 --> 25:24.061
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

25:29.541 --> 25:31.270
<i>Your trunk is open.</i>

25:33.512 --> 25:36.174
<i>Your hood latch is undone.</i>

25:41.120 --> 25:42.917
<i>Your door is ajar.</i>

25:44.389 --> 25:46.084
<i>Your door is ajar.</i>

25:47.893 --> 25:49.554
<i>Your door is ajar.</i>

25:50.929 --> 25:51.987
<i>Your door is...</i>

27:21.697 --> 27:24.052
There were a lot of things
working against me.

27:24.154 --> 27:26.574
I didn't know the city or
how to get around in it.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.952
I didn't know anyone to turn to for help.

27:29.063 --> 27:31.153
I didn't like the noise, the congestion,

27:31.165 --> 27:33.431
the underlying current of tension.

27:33.479 --> 27:35.391
But there was one thing working for me.

27:35.509 --> 27:36.509
Nobody knew me.

27:36.767 --> 27:39.623
And nobody would know I
was working on the case.

28:56.763 --> 28:58.788
<i>There was something
about Marti's place</i>

28:58.865 --> 29:00.526
<i>that felt familiar,</i>

29:00.600 --> 29:02.932
<i>although I couldn't quite
put my finger on it.</i>

29:03.002 --> 29:07.132
<i>Maybe it was the palm trees or
the fancy car in the driveway.</i>

29:07.207 --> 29:11.200
<i>Something made me feel
like I'd been here before.</i>

29:25.858 --> 29:27.917
<i>Don't look at the dogs,
work the lock.</i>

29:27.994 --> 29:30.053
Work the lock.
Don't look at the dogs.

29:30.129 --> 29:32.495
You looked at the dogs.

29:49.749 --> 29:52.343
<i>It didn't take a world-class
private investigator</i>

29:52.418 --> 29:54.283
<i>to figure out what was going on.</i>

29:54.354 --> 29:57.983
<i>It was pretty obvious that Marti was
living in the estate's guest house,</i>

29:58.057 --> 30:00.321
<i>sponging off some good-natured millionaire,</i>

30:00.393 --> 30:04.159
<i>while she tried to decide which
direction her life was taking.</i>

30:10.503 --> 30:15.167
<i>But then, I've never been one to
judge how anyone else lived their life.</i>

30:15.975 --> 30:19.138
<i>The important thing was I'd
found where Marti was living,</i>

30:19.212 --> 30:20.975
<i>and I was hoping
that something there</i>

30:21.047 --> 30:24.039
<i>would point me in
the direction of her killer.</i>

30:37.930 --> 30:42.264
<i>But for some reason the direction
kept turning toward a friend of hers.</i>

30:42.335 --> 30:44.633
<i>A friend who had already died.</i>

30:45.071 --> 30:47.596
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

30:49.776 --> 30:51.607
Who the hell are you?

30:51.678 --> 30:53.646
And what are you doing
in my house?

30:53.813 --> 30:55.940
<i>Hi, Lila.
You don't know me...</i>

30:56.015 --> 30:58.279
Don't move.
You're under arrest.

31:01.587 --> 31:04.078
This better be good. What the
hell were you doing in her house?

31:04.157 --> 31:05.852
<i>Well, I just thought
it was kind of strange</i>

31:05.925 --> 31:08.052
<i>that some friend of Marti's,
also a comic,</i>

31:08.127 --> 31:10.152
<i>also an employee
of the Comedy Hangout,</i>

31:10.229 --> 31:12.220
just happens to die
two weeks ago.

31:12.298 --> 31:15.495
Don't you think there
might be a connection there?

31:16.369 --> 31:18.894
That kid was whacked
out of his mind.

31:19.305 --> 31:22.206
The only connection is that your
little girlfriend was his dealer...

31:22.275 --> 31:25.039
<i>She's not my girlfriend.
Well, whatever.</i>

31:25.111 --> 31:27.739
And I don't think she's anybody's
dealer. She's not the type.

31:27.814 --> 31:31.341
Not the type.

31:32.852 --> 31:35.946
<i>Let me clue you in on something here, okay?</i>

31:36.989 --> 31:39.423
We got a drug problem
in this city.

31:39.992 --> 31:44.895
We got guys selling coke to junior high
school kids off of ice-cream trucks.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.961
I picked up a 19-year-old
girl last week

31:47.033 --> 31:49.160
who knifed somebody
over $100 worth of crack.

31:49.235 --> 31:50.327
Where you think she lived?

31:50.403 --> 31:52.234
I don't like drugs
any more than you do.

31:52.305 --> 31:54.603
Where do you think she lived?

31:56.976 --> 31:58.841
Beverly Hills.

32:02.648 --> 32:05.014
You think that's
an isolated case?

32:07.787 --> 32:10.984
<i>Marti Jensen ripped off somebody,
and they're sending a message.</i>

32:11.057 --> 32:12.183
It's that simple.

32:12.258 --> 32:15.250
<i>Over, done with, and on to the
next party. How do you know that?</i>

32:15.328 --> 32:18.161
How do you know that? Did
you find any drugs on her?

32:18.231 --> 32:19.698
In her place?

32:20.166 --> 32:21.793
You got a better idea?

32:22.535 --> 32:25.902
<i>Look, if that's all it was,
drugs, why are they following me?</i>

32:27.240 --> 32:28.605
Who's following you?

32:28.674 --> 32:31.541
<i>Well, I don't know. There
was this guy at the airport.</i>

32:31.611 --> 32:33.044
Marti was kind of watching him.

32:33.112 --> 32:34.409
He was a good-looking guy.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.004
I didn't think anything
of it at the time.

32:36.082 --> 32:37.515
<i>But he got
in this blue Town Car,</i>

32:37.583 --> 32:40.313
<i>and then today on my way to
Marti's, I saw what could have been</i>

32:40.386 --> 32:42.286
the same blue Town Car
behind me.

32:42.855 --> 32:44.686
You got a description
of this guy?

32:45.491 --> 32:47.925
<i>He was about 40,</i>

32:49.028 --> 32:50.723
<i>6'1 ", 6'2",</i>

32:50.797 --> 32:53.027
<i>180, athletic build.
He had light brown hair.</i>

32:53.099 --> 32:55.795
There was just something
real distinctive about him.

33:15.087 --> 33:17.555
That's him. That's him.
Who is he?

33:19.859 --> 33:21.918
Anton Peters.

33:22.995 --> 33:24.690
<i>We think he's a major
drug supplier,</i>

33:24.764 --> 33:27.232
but vice has never been
able to get anything on him.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.932
If we could somehow connect
him with Marti's death...

33:32.071 --> 33:33.936
I want you to go
to a safe house.

33:34.006 --> 33:36.770
<i>I've got a couple of things to
do, and then I'll meet you there.</i>

33:36.843 --> 33:39.141
I can find my own place
to stay. Thanks anyway.

33:41.747 --> 33:45.239
I have a real lousy
bedside manner.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.050
<i>I'd like to think
it's 'cause of the job,</i>

33:50.223 --> 33:53.818
<i>but the truth is, I'd be as big
a jerk if I was a pediatrician.</i>

33:56.562 --> 33:57.893
I'm sorry.

33:58.364 --> 34:00.298
<i>No, don't apologize.</i>

34:06.539 --> 34:10.100
<i>I can see why you wouldn't
want to do anything that I say,</i>

34:11.476 --> 34:13.172
<i>but I'm asking you,</i>

34:13.246 --> 34:16.272
please take this address
and go there.

34:17.717 --> 34:20.777
I'm going after Peters
and I need your help.

34:21.853 --> 34:25.551
And the last thing I'd wanna do
is come I.D. You in the morgue.

34:26.626 --> 34:29.424
<i>Look, it's my house.
You'll be safe there.</i>

34:31.496 --> 34:34.398
Together maybe we can get the
guy who killed Marti Jensen.

34:57.889 --> 35:00.687
<i>There's something about being
in the other team's home town</i>

35:00.758 --> 35:03.955
<i>that can throw you off
your game just a bit.</i>

35:04.362 --> 35:06.694
<i>I knew if I were in Hawaii
there were some questions</i>

35:06.764 --> 35:08.959
<i>I'd have asked McKee
before I left him.</i>

35:09.033 --> 35:11.695
<i>Like why he hadn't bothered
going over to the Comedy Hangout</i>

35:11.769 --> 35:13.498
<i>to look for any clues?</i>

35:13.571 --> 35:16.472
<i>Like why had I beat him
to Marti's house?</i>

35:16.541 --> 35:20.671
<i>And why was he suddenly so interested
in having my help in the case?</i>

36:31.582 --> 36:34.483
Come on.
Let's get out of here!

36:53.050 --> 36:54.050
Sushi man?

36:55.573 --> 36:56.573
Uh, no.

36:57.096 --> 36:58.096
No.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.700
You know there's nothing like a
hot jacuzzi in the spring rain.

37:08.122 --> 37:10.655
Kinda makes your body tingle all over.

37:11.491 --> 37:12.891
You know what I mean.

37:16.832 --> 37:18.113
Sushi man?

37:54.332 --> 37:56.562
I didn't know where else to go.

38:04.675 --> 38:08.042
<i>Earlier tonight, the peaceful
quiet of this Margate neighborhood</i>

38:08.112 --> 38:09.739
<i>erupted in violence.</i>

38:09.813 --> 38:11.781
<i>Witnesses say that
around 9:15</i>

38:11.849 --> 38:15.114
<i>the sound of automatic gunfire was
heard emanating from this house.</i>

38:15.185 --> 38:16.311
<i>Now, although the area...</i>

38:16.387 --> 38:18.321
That should take care
of any infection.

38:18.389 --> 38:19.856
<i>Officials say that this incident</i>

38:19.924 --> 38:21.915
<i>cannot be linked
to the earlier episodes.</i>

38:21.992 --> 38:24.552
<i>What they are not saying
is that the shooting...</i>

38:24.628 --> 38:28.086
<i>You know, it's great,
you taking me in like this.</i>

38:28.165 --> 38:29.860
But I could be
putting you in danger.

38:29.934 --> 38:32.164
I don't think it's fair
for me to stay here.

38:32.236 --> 38:33.965
I never said you could.

38:34.038 --> 38:35.665
<i>David, I'm standing
outside the home</i>

38:35.739 --> 38:38.230
<i>of Los Angeles
police detective Sam McKee,</i>

38:38.309 --> 38:42.678
<i>where two armed gunmen went on a shooting
spree approximately three hours ago.</i>

38:43.147 --> 38:46.139
<i>This rental car, photographed
shortly after the incident,</i>

38:46.216 --> 38:48.309
<i>was apparently
the only casualty.</i>

38:48.385 --> 38:50.285
<i>The driver is still
unaccounted for,</i>

38:50.354 --> 38:52.845
<i>and police are withholding
his identity at this time.</i>

38:52.923 --> 38:54.413
Happy birthday.

38:54.491 --> 38:56.891
<i>Police officials contacted
declined to be interviewed...</i>

38:56.961 --> 38:58.622
Sorry I'm late.

39:00.598 --> 39:02.657
What makes you think
you're late?

39:03.634 --> 39:05.602
Because I always am.

39:07.404 --> 39:09.770
<i>Just go ahead, open it.</i>

39:09.840 --> 39:12.434
<i>Los Angeles vice
department moved into</i>

39:12.509 --> 39:14.374
<i>the Margate neighborhood...</i>

39:14.645 --> 39:16.237
<i>A card. "To Bill,
love always, Squeakie."</i>

39:16.313 --> 39:17.780
Give me that!

39:21.051 --> 39:22.575
"Squeakie"?

39:23.787 --> 39:25.550
It's someone else.

39:30.336 --> 39:32.012
Just see if it fits.

39:32.232 --> 39:34.632
You shouldn't have. Oh look at this.

39:37.682 --> 39:39.882
Looks great. Uh-oh wait a minute.

39:41.628 --> 39:43.751
Think the sleeves are going
to be a little bit short.

39:44.211 --> 39:46.611
Well real men roll up their sleeves.

39:53.094 --> 39:55.961
We asked the witness exactly what happened.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.687
I was sitting in the jacuzzi
and I was waiting for Josh.

40:00.919 --> 40:04.308
And this terrifying man came crashing into the backyard

40:04.333 --> 40:05.723
and he rushed right at me.

40:06.326 --> 40:08.757
I was so scared I couldn't even scream for help.

40:08.781 --> 40:13.001
I just closed my eyes and prayed
he wouldn't kill me or worse.

40:19.910 --> 40:20.910
Oh, no.

40:21.631 --> 40:22.831
You don't think...

40:23.150 --> 40:24.823
No I don't

40:24.848 --> 40:26.797
I mean you hardly know me.

40:28.777 --> 40:31.153
I guess you're going to have to trust me.

40:31.557 --> 40:32.557
Right.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.399
<i>Thank you, Angela.</i>

40:35.474 --> 40:37.533
<i>In connection with that case,
we have just learned</i>

40:37.610 --> 40:40.636
<i>that Detective Sam McKee was
found murdered this evening.</i>

40:40.713 --> 40:43.648
<i>Shot to death in his car
in his precinct parking lot,</i>

40:43.716 --> 40:46.708
<i>shortly after the shootout
at his Margate home.</i>

40:46.786 --> 40:48.811
<i>Police investigators
are claiming.</i>

40:48.888 --> 40:52.380
<i>McKee's death and the earlier
shootout are unrelated.</i>

40:53.430 --> 40:54.214
Dammit.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.364
What? What?

40:55.513 --> 40:57.222
Never assume their on your side

40:57.246 --> 40:59.120
just cause their wearing the right uniform.

40:59.188 --> 41:00.082
What are you doing?

41:00.113 --> 41:01.913
I should have known better. They can find me here.

41:02.041 --> 41:02.947
Why, were you followed?

41:02.971 --> 41:03.387
No.

41:03.403 --> 41:05.327
Then how can they possibly know where you are?

41:05.354 --> 41:07.991
There's only one person who knew
I was delivering papers to you.

41:08.038 --> 41:10.271
I just want to make sure he doesn't tell anybody.

41:22.742 --> 41:24.075
King Kamehameha Club.

41:24.759 --> 41:25.803
Where have to been?

41:25.829 --> 41:28.457
You were supposed to check in 24 hours ago.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.345
I've talked to most of his friends.

41:30.396 --> 41:33.152
I searched a ten block radius
starting from the garage.

41:33.223 --> 41:34.796
He's got to be out there somewhere.

41:34.836 --> 41:37.157
It's as if you vanished into thin air.

41:37.167 --> 41:39.500
We could talk to the owner of the
car. Have they checked the manifest?

41:39.556 --> 41:40.793
What about the papers?

41:41.756 --> 41:43.769
Manifest. Registration.Everything.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.559
Well obviously there's much more to this
than just a shipping of the family car.

41:47.715 --> 41:49.207
It was demolished.

41:49.765 --> 41:52.232
The police searched every inch of it.

41:52.368 --> 41:53.423
They didn't find anything.

41:53.486 --> 41:54.486
Oh my God.

41:54.575 --> 41:57.647
Maybe what they're looking for has
already been taking out of the car.

41:57.687 --> 41:59.554
You must talk to the police.

41:59.846 --> 42:00.846
Yeah.

42:01.070 --> 42:02.953
They might not have searched the garage.

42:03.008 --> 42:04.123
I mean why would they?

42:04.186 --> 42:07.075
Especially if this involves drug trafficking.

42:09.423 --> 42:11.188
I'm going to talk to Lieutenant Tanaka.

42:11.230 --> 42:12.594
Yeah, and I'm going with you.

42:12.886 --> 42:13.886
Magnum,

42:14.889 --> 42:17.089
there's no point in being a hero.

42:20.348 --> 42:21.348
Good night.

42:24.508 --> 42:27.568
You have some reason to believe
these kids were involved in drugs?

42:27.645 --> 42:30.614
I'm saying that maybe
they stole the wrong car.

42:30.681 --> 42:34.014
Got into something they
didn't even know was going on.

42:34.084 --> 42:35.779
<i>If there were drugs in this car,</i>

42:35.853 --> 42:38.219
whoever came after them
would have found them.

42:44.528 --> 42:45.859
Maybe not.

42:47.798 --> 42:49.493
I don't think this is cleanser.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.571
<i>Cocaine, Lieutenant?</i>

42:58.642 --> 43:01.042
Looks like somebody tried
to get rid of it in a hurry.

43:01.111 --> 43:02.738
You think Kenny knew about this?

43:02.813 --> 43:05.543
<i>No, but the guys that are looking
for it probably think he did.</i>

43:05.616 --> 43:08.210
We can't assume they're
still looking for him.

43:08.285 --> 43:10.116
<i>If he's alive, he's a witness to two murders,</i>

43:10.187 --> 43:11.518
and he can still ID them.

43:11.588 --> 43:14.079
There's no way
they're gonna let him live.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.119
Where is that kid?

43:30.830 --> 43:33.918
Do you think they're going to figure out where you are?

43:33.942 --> 43:36.137
Do you have a gun?

43:36.211 --> 43:37.200
No.

43:37.545 --> 43:40.673
<i>God, no. I wouldn't even
know where to get one.</i>

43:47.956 --> 43:49.583
It's the coffee.

43:49.924 --> 43:51.118
Yeah.

43:51.793 --> 43:53.124
Thank you.

43:57.332 --> 44:00.790
<i>Look, suppose Marti followed
the drug flow to Hawaii.</i>

44:00.869 --> 44:03.394
<i>That's a giant assumption,
I know, but we could</i>

44:03.471 --> 44:05.871
assume that she
was following Peters.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.238
And it's possible that
all the bits and pieces

44:08.309 --> 44:10.971
that she put together
are related.

44:11.045 --> 44:13.673
<i>So, a kid commits suicide,
maybe,</i>

44:13.748 --> 44:17.047
and Marti shows up in Hawaii. So does Peters.

44:17.118 --> 44:19.177
But where does Lila fit in?

44:19.988 --> 44:22.320
And what about Jesse Hermano?

44:22.857 --> 44:25.519
Why is she carrying
his picture around?

44:25.860 --> 44:27.452
What am I doing?

44:29.697 --> 44:31.722
What the hell am I doing?

44:33.668 --> 44:36.262
<i>There are a bunch of lunatics
out there trying to kill you,</i>

44:36.337 --> 44:39.500
and we're acting like it's
just another Saturday night.

44:39.574 --> 44:41.667
What else can we do?
Call the police.

44:41.743 --> 44:44.041
<i>I tried that.
Well, try again.</i>

44:44.646 --> 44:46.170
I know this cop.

44:46.247 --> 44:49.307
<i>His name is Frank Danton. I met him
when I was working in the DA's office,</i>

44:49.384 --> 44:50.612
my last year in law school.

44:50.685 --> 44:54.121
And I could just call him
first thing in the morning.

45:06.401 --> 45:08.631
Do you really want this coffee?

45:09.170 --> 45:10.398
No.

45:11.272 --> 45:12.739
Me neither.

45:16.778 --> 45:18.370
Excuse me.

45:24.185 --> 45:26.210
I need to borrow your car.

45:27.422 --> 45:28.753
Now?

45:31.125 --> 45:33.252
You won't reconsider the police?

45:43.471 --> 45:45.200
<i>Guess we'll just have
to do it your way, then.</i>

45:45.273 --> 45:46.501
What are you doing?

45:46.574 --> 45:49.202
Driving. I can't let you
do that. It's not safe.

45:51.079 --> 45:53.639
Do you think that I'm gonna
trust you to drive my car?

45:53.715 --> 45:56.548
I saw what you did
to that last car you had.

45:56.618 --> 46:00.179
<i>Well, you're not coming with
me. That's absolutely final.</i>

46:01.122 --> 46:03.989
So whatever happened
to old Howard?

46:07.328 --> 46:10.525
<i>Well, he left college early</i>

46:10.598 --> 46:13.328
to go join a mission
in Guatemala.

46:14.269 --> 46:16.499
<i>He wanted me to come with him,</i>

46:17.372 --> 46:20.535
but I was too afraid to go
so far away from home.

46:21.743 --> 46:23.973
So I became a dental hygienist.

46:25.213 --> 46:29.843
It was a much safer thing to do.

46:32.220 --> 46:34.313
And what about Bill?

46:38.793 --> 46:40.761
<i>Oh, there comes someone.</i>

46:42.263 --> 46:43.662
That's Lila.

46:54.242 --> 46:56.176
Please don't say
follow that car.

47:27.842 --> 47:29.434
<i>Jesse, it's Lila.</i>

47:54.268 --> 47:55.929
So what now?

48:03.244 --> 48:05.712
<i>Well, we could stay here,</i>

48:07.582 --> 48:10.176
or I could try
and get a little closer

48:11.452 --> 48:13.477
and see who she's meeting.

48:15.923 --> 48:18.221
It would be a lot safer to wait.

48:22.697 --> 48:24.358
Don't go anywhere.

48:44.986 --> 48:48.478
<i>Listen,
about kissing you earlier...</i>

48:52.527 --> 48:54.518
I'm sorry if I...

48:55.430 --> 48:58.365
<i>You know, I didn't mean to.</i>

48:59.400 --> 49:01.095
<i>You know, I...</i>

49:02.570 --> 49:05.130
I didn't mind you kissing me.

49:06.073 --> 49:10.373
I just... I didn't know
what to do.

49:15.082 --> 49:16.413
Oh.

49:18.352 --> 49:19.444
Well.

50:16.210 --> 50:18.303
<i>I had a feeling
that Lila was gonna lead me</i>

50:18.379 --> 50:20.711
<i>right to the players
behind the drug ring.</i>

50:20.781 --> 50:24.239
<i>I suspected Anton Peters was
the man behind the iron gates.</i>

50:24.318 --> 50:27.719
<i>The person I didn't expect
to see was Jesse Hermano.</i>

50:29.056 --> 50:30.853
Thomas.

50:32.293 --> 50:33.590
<i>Cynthia, no.</i>

50:38.432 --> 50:40.093
My God!

50:42.203 --> 50:44.103
Get to the car. Pick me
up in front of the house.

50:44.171 --> 50:46.401
But where are you going?
The scenic route.

51:20.274 --> 51:22.868
Did they get the license
plate number? It's dark.

51:22.944 --> 51:26.141
But what if they got the license
plate number? I don't know.

51:27.748 --> 51:29.113
They didn't kill us.

51:29.183 --> 51:31.674
They didn't kill us!

51:32.653 --> 51:35.247
Do you think now
we could call the police?

51:45.733 --> 51:48.327
What made you decide
to go to law school?

51:48.469 --> 51:49.834
I don't know.

51:50.137 --> 51:54.198
<i>You know, I just woke up one morning
and I realized that I had been...</i>

51:54.275 --> 51:58.006
I was 28 and I'd never really been 18. What?

51:58.479 --> 52:02.040
<i>I mean, I had been a dental
hygienist for eight years,</i>

52:02.316 --> 52:05.183
and it didn't look like Howard
was gonna come back from Guatemala

52:05.252 --> 52:07.379
and suddenly decide to marry me.

52:07.521 --> 52:09.512
And I'd missed everything.

52:10.157 --> 52:11.784
<i>I mean, college.</i>

52:12.159 --> 52:13.456
The '70s.

52:14.628 --> 52:17.028
Being part of
the "Me" generation.

52:17.331 --> 52:19.959
Struggling to balance
career and motherhood.

52:20.034 --> 52:22.161
<i>You know, all the good stuff.</i>

52:22.569 --> 52:24.298
<i>So I wrote to Howard,</i>

52:24.371 --> 52:26.339
<i>and I told him that
I was quitting my job,</i>

52:26.407 --> 52:29.308
and that I was coming to
Guatemala to live with him.

52:30.177 --> 52:31.838
What'd he say?

52:31.912 --> 52:34.972
<i>He wrote back, and he told me
that there were a few things</i>

52:35.049 --> 52:36.710
he'd been meaning to tell me.

52:36.784 --> 52:40.481
And he also sent along pictures
of his wife and six kids.

52:42.222 --> 52:45.350
Sounds like he'd been real busy.

52:45.426 --> 52:46.916
<i>Yeah.
You know, it's funny,</i>

52:46.994 --> 52:49.963
Howard never had that much
energy when I knew him.

52:51.498 --> 52:54.228
<i>So I cried for about 12 minutes,</i>

52:54.301 --> 52:57.168
and then I resolved
never again to sit around

52:57.237 --> 53:00.070
and wait for somebody else
to make my life exciting.

53:01.775 --> 53:03.743
So you became a lawyer?

53:03.811 --> 53:06.177
<i>Yeah, I thought it would
open up a few doors.</i>

53:06.246 --> 53:09.545
So far my practice has
consisted mostly of dentists

53:09.616 --> 53:12.084
I knew before
I went back to school.

53:12.152 --> 53:14.814
But putting together
this movie deal

53:14.888 --> 53:17.322
is really a big
opportunity for me.

53:20.027 --> 53:21.619
What about Bill?

53:23.430 --> 53:24.954
There's Frank.

53:26.066 --> 53:27.966
<i>Oh, he got a promotion.</i>

53:28.602 --> 53:30.001
Undercover.
Undercover.

53:30.070 --> 53:31.401
Yeah.
Yeah.

53:35.309 --> 53:37.334
You think McKee was a dirty cop?

53:37.411 --> 53:39.504
I don't know if he was or not.

53:39.580 --> 53:42.572
I only know that nobody else
knew I was going to his house.

53:42.649 --> 53:44.514
<i>Well, who else would
have set up the shooting?</i>

53:44.585 --> 53:46.382
Some people think maybe you did.

53:46.987 --> 53:49.888
Think maybe Sam was onto
something and you set up the kill.

53:49.957 --> 53:52.289
Which is why they started
shooting at Thomas.

53:52.359 --> 53:54.122
That makes a lot of sense.

53:54.194 --> 53:56.719
He's still walking around.
Sam isn't.

53:56.897 --> 54:02.028
<i>Oh, don't give me this
ridiculous blood brothers garbage.</i>

54:02.369 --> 54:04.860
No one is above reproach just
because they wear a badge.

54:04.938 --> 54:07.031
<i>I'm just telling you
what I hear, that's all.</i>

54:07.775 --> 54:10.141
Did you find anything
on the Peters case?

54:10.210 --> 54:13.043
Found a file.
Nothing in it.

54:13.414 --> 54:15.177
Nothing.

54:16.283 --> 54:20.617
<i>Look, you wanna come downtown,
you wanna file a report...</i>

54:33.567 --> 54:35.501
<i>Thanks a lot, Frank.</i>

54:37.137 --> 54:38.627
Wait a minute.

54:43.510 --> 54:45.239
There is one thing.

54:45.979 --> 54:48.573
<i>I don't know if
this guy can help you,</i>

54:48.649 --> 54:50.549
but he used to be
one of Sam's informants.

54:50.617 --> 54:54.451
<i>His name is Eddy. You can usually
find him at the Fifth Street Bar.</i>

54:54.521 --> 54:57.285
<i>He's a real slime, and I doubt
if he can give you anything,</i>

54:57.357 --> 54:59.791
<i>but you never can tell.</i>

55:19.580 --> 55:22.071
<i>Hey, Eddy. Where you going? Slow down.</i>

55:22.149 --> 55:23.946
My friend and I
wanna buy you a drink.

55:24.017 --> 55:26.349
Who are you?
Sam McKee sent us.

55:26.420 --> 55:28.285
I don't know any Sam McKee.

55:28.355 --> 55:30.550
Really?
That's very strange.

55:31.024 --> 55:32.389
'Cause he knows you.

55:32.826 --> 55:33.850
Nope.

55:33.927 --> 55:35.554
<i>See, unfortunately, Eddy,</i>

55:35.629 --> 55:38.689
Sam left a little present for
you at the police department.

55:38.765 --> 55:42.701
It's a record of all cash receipts
for paid informant Eddy Rentzel.

55:43.303 --> 55:46.272
<i>You know, you've been making
some pretty good money, Eddy.</i>

55:46.340 --> 55:49.832
<i>October 4, $50, August 4, $50.</i>

55:49.910 --> 55:51.241
Wow!

55:51.311 --> 55:52.938
Here's one for $300.
No.

55:53.013 --> 55:55.072
He never gave me
$300 for nothing.

55:55.149 --> 55:56.377
That's a lie.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.472
I can't talk here.

56:23.043 --> 56:26.638
<i>All my friends,
they'd think I was a fink.</i>

56:30.951 --> 56:32.714
McKee never told me nothing.

56:32.786 --> 56:34.151
Eddy.
Honest to God.

56:34.221 --> 56:35.586
<i>But you hear things, you know?</i>

56:35.656 --> 56:36.680
<i>Well, what'd you hear?</i>

56:36.757 --> 56:38.418
<i>Well, there was this shipment, cocaine,</i>

56:38.492 --> 56:39.857
coming in from the south.

56:39.927 --> 56:41.792
<i>I heard it was
some kind of rush job,</i>

56:41.862 --> 56:45.354
<i>and that McKee was running
protection on it, you know.</i>

56:45.432 --> 56:46.865
When was it due to arrive?

56:46.934 --> 56:48.367
I don't know for sure.

56:48.435 --> 56:49.561
Where?

56:49.636 --> 56:51.035
I don't know.
I don't know!

56:51.104 --> 56:52.571
<i>Well, you think
you could find out?</i>

56:56.243 --> 56:59.474
<i>Well, maybe we could
talk to a few people.</i>

57:00.013 --> 57:02.106
Tell them what you told us.

57:02.816 --> 57:04.909
<i>Oh, you're asking a lot for $50.</i>

57:04.985 --> 57:06.452
<i>Okay, we'll go somewhere else.</i>

57:06.520 --> 57:07.885
Wait.

57:09.256 --> 57:12.157
You don't tell anybody
where this came from.

57:12.359 --> 57:13.724
Not a soul.

57:16.530 --> 57:19.863
I'll see what I can do.
Come back tomorrow.

57:19.933 --> 57:22.367
You gonna be
needing that bottle?

57:24.171 --> 57:26.571
A record of cash receipts?

57:26.640 --> 57:28.574
They don't keep records
of paid informants.

57:28.642 --> 57:29.768
I know.

57:29.843 --> 57:32.243
<i>They'd never pay him
$300, either.</i>

57:34.982 --> 57:36.779
<i>So, where to next?</i>

57:36.850 --> 57:38.374
<i>Well, I'm gonna drop you off at your house,</i>

57:38.452 --> 57:40.420
then pay a visit
to Jesse Hermano.

57:40.487 --> 57:42.921
How are you gonna
get in to see him?

57:43.423 --> 57:45.391
I'll think of something.

57:46.927 --> 57:49.225
Good. I don't mind
tagging along.

57:49.296 --> 57:51.457
No. Not this time.
It's too dangerous.

57:51.531 --> 57:54.227
You're not going.
Absolutely not. Mmm-mmm.

58:35.175 --> 58:36.335
Hello.

58:47.654 --> 58:49.588
<i>You know, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,</i>

58:49.656 --> 58:53.183
<i>but I have been jogging by your
house every day for two weeks now,</i>

58:53.260 --> 58:54.818
hoping that I'd run into you.

58:54.895 --> 58:56.624
You're kidding.

58:57.531 --> 58:59.362
You probably think I'm terrible.

58:59.433 --> 59:00.900
<i>No, no, no.</i>

59:00.967 --> 59:04.664
<i>Listen, you gotta do what you gotta
do to get ahead in this business.</i>

59:05.505 --> 59:08.099
I'm surprised
I didn't see you before.

59:10.777 --> 59:12.438
<i>You know, I'm...</i>

59:12.512 --> 59:15.970
I can't believe that you would
take time from your busy schedule

59:16.049 --> 59:18.176
to talk to me
about my little movie.

59:18.251 --> 59:22.153
<i>No, I want you to know that I
really, really appreciate it.</i>

59:24.991 --> 59:27.425
I don't even know
where to begin.

59:27.494 --> 59:30.019
<i>Am I making you nervous?
Oh, no, no. Not at all.</i>

59:32.165 --> 59:33.427
So...

59:49.383 --> 59:52.443
<i>I tell you, though, the
hairiest one was in Jonestown.</i>

59:52.519 --> 59:55.852
I didn't think we were
gonna get out of there alive.

59:55.922 --> 59:57.549
Did you see the special
I did on that?

59:57.624 --> 01:00:01.060
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, that was
really something. Something.</i>

01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:02.493
Yes.
Yes.

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:21.481
Excuse me. I gotta do something
about this. I'll be right back.

01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:23.839
Don't go away!

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:35.825
<i>What's the matter with you, boy?</i>

01:00:41.735 --> 01:00:44.829
What's the matter with you?
You're acting like a lunatic.

01:01:03.857 --> 01:01:05.085
Damn it!

01:01:12.265 --> 01:01:15.564
<i>This one has the earliest
date, so let's start here.</i>

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.469
Hmm.

01:01:30.784 --> 01:01:33.844
<i>Oh, my God!
Get that out of there!</i>

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.979
<i>Squeakie, I presume?</i>

01:01:36.056 --> 01:01:38.217
I thought I changed that tape.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.155
<i>Well, I think we have time
to look at one tape</i>

01:01:42.229 --> 01:01:43.787
before we really
get down to work.

01:01:43.864 --> 01:01:46.799
<i>Yeah, well, fortunately
it won't be that one.</i>

01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:52.364
<i>Listen, I know this is none
of my business, Squeakie,</i>

01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:56.273
but how come you never gave
Bill his birthday present?

01:01:57.077 --> 01:01:59.705
I discovered
I didn't like snorkeling.

01:02:07.153 --> 01:02:08.620
<i>Hey, florist.</i>

01:02:14.528 --> 01:02:17.520
<i>Oh, no, you keep it.
Hang it over there.</i>

01:02:22.235 --> 01:02:24.795
<i>T. C., any luck?</i>

01:02:27.674 --> 01:02:30.575
I'm afraid I came up
empty-handed as well.

01:02:30.777 --> 01:02:33.109
<i>Well, we'll just keep looking.</i>

01:02:33.413 --> 01:02:35.210
<i>He's gotta come up for air
sooner or later,</i>

01:02:35.282 --> 01:02:37.614
<i>and when he does,
somebody'll see him.</i>

01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:42.549
<i>Look, Kenny is not dead. We
cannot start thinking like that.</i>

01:02:43.456 --> 01:02:44.718
<i>No, of course not.</i>

01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:46.452
<i>Look, give us some more
of those flyers,</i>

01:02:46.526 --> 01:02:48.357
and we'll meet
back here at 6:00.

01:02:48.428 --> 01:02:50.828
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:57.597
<i>Hey, T. C., don't you worry. We'll find him.</i>

01:03:16.523 --> 01:03:19.253
<i>I'm standing in front of
the National Cathedral,</i>

01:03:19.326 --> 01:03:22.261
<i>where Miguel Delgado and
his family come to worship.</i>

01:03:22.329 --> 01:03:24.593
<i>Critics from
the Blanca Rosa regime</i>

01:03:24.664 --> 01:03:26.655
<i>claim ties with Fidel Castro,</i>

01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:30.169
<i>and paint this brutal picture
of world-wide terrorism</i>

01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:31.794
<i>and Communist takeover.</i>

01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:34.305
<i>Well, nothing could be
further from the truth.</i>

01:03:34.507 --> 01:03:37.738
<i>Miguel Delgado, placed in
office by free election,</i>

01:03:37.811 --> 01:03:41.372
<i>may not serve the best
interest of corporate America,</i>

01:03:41.448 --> 01:03:45.077
<i>but neither is he to be construed
as a puppet of Fidel Castro,</i>

01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:46.846
<i>a stooge of the Soviets.</i>

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.445
He's defending Miguel Delgado.

01:03:50.457 --> 01:03:54.188
<i>It's not an unpopular stance,
especially for the press.</i>

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.057
The guy's a dictator
and he supports terrorists.

01:03:56.129 --> 01:03:59.895
Just because they choose to look
the other way doesn't make it right.

01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:10.669
Are you nervous?

01:04:11.578 --> 01:04:12.670
No.

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:15.940
Old love letters from Bill?

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.882
Confetti.

01:04:21.955 --> 01:04:23.047
Ah-ha!

01:04:23.123 --> 01:04:25.717
For the New Year's Eve scene
where Marla breaks down

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:28.488
and confesses that the baby
she's carrying isn't Todd's.

01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:31.553
<i>You read our script.
No, I read Robin's book.</i>

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:40.068
<i>Come on, I thought you had
prop men for that sort of stuff.</i>

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.506
<i>I told you, we're low budget.
Everybody has to chip in.</i>

01:04:42.575 --> 01:04:44.702
<i>Well, then, give me a stack.</i>

01:04:44.978 --> 01:04:46.502
<i>Oh, come on, give me a stack.</i>

01:04:46.579 --> 01:04:49.173
I can watch and tear
at the same time.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:56.978
<i>All right, you get "luminous
products" through "thrift shops."</i>

01:05:00.393 --> 01:05:02.452
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,
as you can see...</i>

01:05:02.529 --> 01:05:04.759
You're tearing up
your own phone book?

01:05:05.565 --> 01:05:07.362
The new one's due out.

01:05:07.434 --> 01:05:09.925
<i>This is the only way
they can do it right now.</i>

01:05:10.203 --> 01:05:13.001
<i>This is Jesse Hermano.
Adiós.</i>

01:05:21.014 --> 01:05:22.345
Pavlovich.

01:05:23.016 --> 01:05:24.415
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

01:05:24.484 --> 01:05:29.012
<i>No, no. Sergei Pavlovich.
And Chetvirukin.</i>

01:05:30.023 --> 01:05:31.888
What's his first name?

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.784
I don't know.

01:05:36.863 --> 01:05:40.663
<i>The people of... Anatol
Chetvirukin and Sergei Pavlovich.</i>

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:42.964
<i>Russians.
KGB, last time I heard.</i>

01:05:43.036 --> 01:05:46.335
So much for Jesse's theory about Delgado
not being a stooge of the Kremlin.

01:05:46.406 --> 01:05:47.873
Maybe he didn't know
who they were.

01:05:47.941 --> 01:05:49.875
<i>Oh, he knows, all right.</i>

01:05:51.144 --> 01:05:52.873
Take a look at this.

01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:58.577
<i>There, you see that light signal? Yes.</i>

01:05:58.651 --> 01:05:59.743
Okay.

01:06:02.489 --> 01:06:04.150
There it is again.

01:06:05.959 --> 01:06:08.587
He's planning to edit out
this segment.

01:06:08.962 --> 01:06:10.327
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:06:10.396 --> 01:06:14.025
<i>I'd say Jesse has a big stake in
Delgado's success, wouldn't you?</i>

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.432
Enough to doctor a tape
to drum up support.

01:06:16.503 --> 01:06:19.370
I wonder what other kind of
support he's giving Delgado?

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:21.532
Money?
Selling product for him?

01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:23.909
Cocaine? Do you know
how risky that is?

01:06:23.977 --> 01:06:27.071
Sometimes you get hooked
on political conviction.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:30.180
<i>Well, it's a great theory, but hardly
enough to get an arrest warrant.</i>

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.740
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:06:32.786 --> 01:06:34.811
Do you have a camera?

01:06:37.056 --> 01:06:38.921
<i>If you are going
to use my camera,</i>

01:06:38.992 --> 01:06:41.552
you are going to have
to take me with you.

01:06:41.961 --> 01:06:43.519
<i>And don't try to
talk me out of it,</i>

01:06:43.596 --> 01:06:46.690
because it's not going to work
this time. I wasn't going to.

01:06:46.866 --> 01:06:49.664
<i>You're so far in now,
you're safer with me.</i>

01:06:55.909 --> 01:06:58.309
How do you
work this little thing?

01:06:58.878 --> 01:07:00.641
<i>You hold this up to your eye,</i>

01:07:00.713 --> 01:07:02.874
<i>you look through this
little hole,</i>

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:05.315
and you press
this little button.

01:07:09.489 --> 01:07:11.013
You don't have to wind it.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:12.990
It does it for you.

01:07:13.059 --> 01:07:15.084
<i>Gee, you don't get to do
anything yourself anymore.</i>

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.685
<i>Hey, map to the stars' homes?</i>

01:07:16.763 --> 01:07:18.628
What? No.
Thomas!

01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:20.222
Jesse's meeting Eddy.

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.825
<i>Hey, it's only $1.35.
No!</i>

01:07:22.902 --> 01:07:24.893
<i>Come on, come on. Give
the little lady a thrill?</i>

01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:26.871
<i>All right, fine, here.
Keep the change.</i>

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.704
<i>All right! Thanks.
Hey, have a nice day.</i>

01:07:48.428 --> 01:07:49.793
Look out!

01:07:51.564 --> 01:07:52.553
Are you all right?

01:07:52.632 --> 01:07:55.100
Do you ever have any trouble
getting car insurance?

01:07:55.168 --> 01:07:57.534
<i>Oh, wow, like, I'm really sorry!</i>

01:07:57.604 --> 01:07:59.765
<i>I was, like, listening to
INXS on my radio, you know.</i>

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:01.636
<i>I mean, like, you're just
driving your car one minute,</i>

01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:03.733
<i>listening to your absolute
favorite song,</i>

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.643
<i>and, like, the next minute...
Are you okay?</i>

01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:08.340
<i>Well, yeah, like,
physically and everything.</i>

01:08:08.414 --> 01:08:10.541
<i>It's just cosmically I'm a
little freaked out, you know.</i>

01:08:10.617 --> 01:08:13.313
<i>I mean, you could be, like, listening
to your absolute favorite song</i>

01:08:13.386 --> 01:08:15.251
<i>one minute, and the next
minute, like, oh, my God...</i>

01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:17.881
<i>Like, aren't we supposed to
exchange driver's licenses</i>

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:20.390
or answering services
or something?

01:08:28.201 --> 01:08:30.192
We still don't have
a smoking gun.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:34.673
<i>Well, we've got the tapes and the
photographs. That's something, at least.</i>

01:09:23.923 --> 01:09:25.390
Who is it?

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:28.221
Do they always deliver your
new phone books by hand?

01:09:28.294 --> 01:09:31.286
No. They usually leave them
on the front porch. Come on.

01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:52.564
<i>Well, if your son hears from
Kenny, will you let me know?</i>

01:09:52.801 --> 01:09:55.032
<i>Thanks, Mrs. Acuna.</i>

01:10:10.086 --> 01:10:13.578
I was driving by
and saw the light.

01:10:19.128 --> 01:10:21.460
I take it there's been no word.

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:24.689
No.

01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:29.968
<i>As irritating as old platitudes can be,</i>

01:10:30.573 --> 01:10:34.134
I suppose there is some comfort
in "No news is good news."

01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:40.874
Would you like some tea
or something?

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:42.884
<i>No, no.
I won't keep you.</i>

01:10:42.952 --> 01:10:45.716
If there's anything else
I can do...

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:49.090
I'll call.

01:10:50.059 --> 01:10:51.617
Please.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.133
Thanks.

01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:06.635
<i>This is it.
I have had it.</i>

01:11:07.877 --> 01:11:10.471
<i>I am perfectly happy to
find you a place to hide out,</i>

01:11:10.546 --> 01:11:12.343
<i>but just as soon as
I can get ahold of Frank,</i>

01:11:12.415 --> 01:11:13.973
<i>I am putting you in his care,</i>

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:16.041
and then I am going away!

01:11:16.118 --> 01:11:18.313
Going away? Where?

01:11:18.387 --> 01:11:20.719
Who cares? Anywhere!

01:11:21.857 --> 01:11:25.224
<i>Thanks to you, I probably don't
even have a movie to make anymore.</i>

01:11:25.294 --> 01:11:27.262
I should have known
you weren't Howard.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:28.991
Howard never called me Cindy!

01:11:29.065 --> 01:11:30.259
<i>Oh, come on...
Never!</i>

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.392
Maybe we can work something
out about the movie.

01:11:32.468 --> 01:11:34.902
Would this something involve
shooting and guns? No.

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:37.235
Did Howard call you Squeakie?

01:11:37.306 --> 01:11:39.706
<i>Oh, come on. I'm just asking. I'm sorry.</i>

01:11:40.843 --> 01:11:43.334
What happened to
my fearless companion?

01:11:43.412 --> 01:11:45.778
My Watson? My Mrs. North? My Tonto?

01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:48.339
<i>Over here.
Look, Cindy.</i>

01:11:48.417 --> 01:11:50.112
<i>Cynthia. I'm sorry,</i>

01:11:52.488 --> 01:11:54.718
I didn't mean to
drag you into this.

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.917
<i>I know how hard it is
on you, believe me.</i>

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.458
<i>Yeah, well, I'm sorry
that my movie company</i>

01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:02.690
can't afford a trailer
for you to hide out in.

01:12:02.765 --> 01:12:05.131
<i>You're... No, you're right.
You gotta talk about it.</i>

01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:07.601
It's fine. Yell at me again if
you want. It's fine. Go ahead.

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:10.366
I have absolutely no interest
in yelling at you.

01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:13.408
I am an adult.
You are an adult.

01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:16.570
I think that we can calmly
and rationally agree

01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:18.477
<i>that as long as I am
anywhere near you,</i>

01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:20.481
my life is in extreme danger.

01:12:20.549 --> 01:12:22.107
<i>Well, I wouldn't go that far.</i>

01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:23.651
Nobody works here
on the weekends.

01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:25.152
There's a guard full-time
at the gate.

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:26.654
There's not a safer place
for you to be.

01:12:26.722 --> 01:12:28.747
Hold it right there!

01:12:34.463 --> 01:12:36.192
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, sir.</i>

01:12:36.532 --> 01:12:38.659
I didn't realize it was you.

01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:42.799
Sorry to disturb you.
Good night.

01:13:00.022 --> 01:13:02.149
Who did he think you were?

01:13:03.559 --> 01:13:07.017
<i>Cynthia, can I have
a little light here?</i>

01:13:10.232 --> 01:13:11.722
<i>Cynthia, you...</i>

01:13:12.501 --> 01:13:14.992
He thought you
were Burt Reynolds?

01:13:29.452 --> 01:13:32.012
He thought that you
were Burt Reynolds.

01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:35.080
Look at this.
This place is great.

01:13:35.758 --> 01:13:37.089
He thought you
were Burt Reynolds.

01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:39.320
<i>Well, what's so shocking
about that?</i>

01:13:39.395 --> 01:13:41.590
But you don't look anything
like Burt Reynolds.

01:13:41.664 --> 01:13:45.031
<i>I don't know, I see
a certain resemblance.</i>

01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:50.900
<i>Well, yeah, you...</i>

01:13:51.273 --> 01:13:53.241
You do both have mustaches.

01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:54.936
<i>You know, I really...</i>

01:13:56.846 --> 01:13:58.973
I really don't see
what's so funny.

01:14:01.684 --> 01:14:03.845
Those guys were really
shooting at us.

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:05.910
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:14:06.922 --> 01:14:08.321
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:10.655
I have never been
so scared in my life!

01:14:10.726 --> 01:14:13.251
Come here. It's okay.

01:14:28.778 --> 01:14:31.178
<i>Hello.
Hello, Mrs. Torie?</i>

01:14:31.247 --> 01:14:34.148
<i>This is Theodore Calvin,
Mark's Babe Ruth League coach.</i>

01:14:34.216 --> 01:14:35.979
<i>Has he been missing practice?</i>

01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:38.246
<i>No, no, no.
I was wondering...</i>

01:14:39.422 --> 01:14:40.912
I need to talk to him.

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.151
<i>I left a couple of messages
with his sister,</i>

01:14:43.225 --> 01:14:45.250
but he never returned them.

01:14:45.561 --> 01:14:47.529
<i>No. He works three
afternoons a week.</i>

01:14:47.596 --> 01:14:49.826
<i>Yeah, at the
Blue Orchid Florist.</i>

01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:51.764
<i>But he's home now.
I'll get him for you.</i>

01:14:51.834 --> 01:14:55.065
<i>Mrs. Torie, did he
go to work today?</i>

01:14:56.105 --> 01:14:59.734
<i>No, he said he had something
more important to do.</i>

01:15:55.831 --> 01:15:57.423
Coach!

01:16:02.071 --> 01:16:04.505
<i>They killed him, T.C.
They killed Ray.</i>

01:16:04.573 --> 01:16:06.473
They killed him.
Yeah.

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:09.841
<i>It's okay, son.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

01:16:21.657 --> 01:16:24.387
<i>Aloha, gentlemen.
You're under arrest!</i>

01:16:26.195 --> 01:16:27.958
On the ground.
On the ground!

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:42.900
<i>Hey, Kenny.</i>

01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:47.876
Where's your van?

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:49.815
<i>Oh, it's across town.</i>

01:16:50.452 --> 01:16:52.750
<i>After Mark told me
where you were,</i>

01:16:52.888 --> 01:16:55.652
I worked out a little switch
with Lieutenant Tanaka.

01:16:56.592 --> 01:16:57.957
Let's go.

01:16:58.227 --> 01:17:00.957
<i>Illegal firearms,
resisting arrest,</i>

01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:03.198
<i>suspicion of murder,</i>

01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:08.433
not bad for a night's work.

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:12.738
<i>A trapeze artist,</i>

01:17:12.808 --> 01:17:14.742
I think that was my first dream.

01:17:15.611 --> 01:17:18.045
And then I wanted
to be a teacher.

01:17:18.113 --> 01:17:19.171
I knew it.

01:17:19.248 --> 01:17:21.216
You couldn't possibly have
known I wanted to be a teacher.

01:17:21.283 --> 01:17:23.843
<i>No, I mean I knew old Burt
would have Fig Newtons.</i>

01:17:23.919 --> 01:17:25.386
I just knew it.

01:17:25.454 --> 01:17:27.115
I guess we got a lot in common.

01:17:29.158 --> 01:17:30.785
I guess so.

01:17:31.794 --> 01:17:33.318
You want some?

01:17:33.395 --> 01:17:35.556
Sure.
Why not live a little?

01:17:37.933 --> 01:17:41.562
And then...
Then I wanted to be

01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:45.898
a devastatingly seductive woman

01:17:45.975 --> 01:17:49.604
who had dozens of men
dangling on a string.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.947
I think that was the week
I hit puberty.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:58.049
<i>You know, that's the trouble
between men and women. Timing.</i>

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.612
<i>Just when girls are thinking about
being devastatingly seductive,</i>

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:05.091
boys are thinking about playing professional
baseball with the Detroit Tigers.

01:18:06.395 --> 01:18:08.522
Hopefully that changes.

01:18:15.838 --> 01:18:17.897
<i>So, what happened
to your dreams?</i>

01:18:22.945 --> 01:18:24.412
I'm not sure.

01:18:26.782 --> 01:18:29.080
Why didn't you ever get married?

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.012
Why didn't you?

01:18:36.225 --> 01:18:37.692
I don't know.

01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:41.654
My mother's been
married four times.

01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:44.094
Mmm.
Got a little confusing.

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:47.602
Not to mention expensive
on Father's Day.

01:18:49.638 --> 01:18:52.801
I guess I just didn't want
to make the same mistakes

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.342
like she did.

01:18:55.377 --> 01:18:58.972
<i>And then lately,
I guess, nobody's asked.</i>

01:19:04.253 --> 01:19:06.221
<i>So, your turn.</i>

01:19:06.522 --> 01:19:09.150
Why didn't you ever get married?

01:19:09.425 --> 01:19:10.756
I did.

01:19:12.428 --> 01:19:13.793
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:19:14.363 --> 01:19:16.024
Me and my stupid assumptions.

01:19:16.098 --> 01:19:18.464
<i>You know, that is why I
could never be a trial lawyer.</i>

01:19:18.534 --> 01:19:22.470
I make these huge assumptions
based on little or no information.

01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:25.831
You're married now.

01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:29.239
<i>No. Well, not exactly.</i>

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.409
<i>Hey, you're a married man?
No, I'm not.</i>

01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.247
It's just that...

01:19:37.953 --> 01:19:42.117
<i>I've always kind of, well, sort
of considered myself married.</i>

01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:46.353
I knew it.
But I'm not.

01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:49.822
I'm not married.

01:19:54.203 --> 01:19:56.103
<i>Well, here we are, huh?</i>

01:19:57.272 --> 01:19:59.172
<i>Two hopeless romantics,</i>

01:19:59.808 --> 01:20:01.833
without a picket fence
between us.

01:20:05.314 --> 01:20:07.407
Would you like a picket fence?

01:20:20.129 --> 01:20:21.289
Hello.

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.028
<i>Frank, you called back!</i>

01:20:24.099 --> 01:20:25.896
<i>Yes, I know that
I called you six times.</i>

01:20:25.968 --> 01:20:27.959
<i>Look, we have to see you
right away.</i>

01:20:28.036 --> 01:20:31.301
We have photos and we have
these tapes and maybe...

01:20:31.373 --> 01:20:34.900
<i>Cynthia, listen. Cynthia.</i>

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:36.968
<i>Oh, it's Eddy Rentzel.</i>

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:38.342
<i>It's that informant
that you sent us to.</i>

01:20:38.413 --> 01:20:39.539
Cynthia.

01:20:39.615 --> 01:20:42.743
<i>Oh, and look, he's our only
chance, but I think that...</i>

01:20:45.154 --> 01:20:47.850
Thomas thinks that he would...

01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:55.589
Oh.

01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:00.361
Oh.

01:21:04.273 --> 01:21:05.399
Oh.

01:21:10.979 --> 01:21:12.173
Yeah.

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:14.780
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

01:21:16.285 --> 01:21:18.480
<i>Yeah, we'll come in tomorrow.</i>

01:21:20.956 --> 01:21:22.287
Okay.

01:21:24.593 --> 01:21:26.322
Thanks a lot.

01:21:30.332 --> 01:21:31.594
Eddy?

01:21:33.936 --> 01:21:36.427
They found him in a garbage can.

01:21:43.145 --> 01:21:46.376
Nobody has the right
to do that to somebody else.

01:21:47.983 --> 01:21:49.883
No matter who they are.

01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:54.654
How could they do that?

01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:05.397
It's gonna stop.

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:11.696
It has to stop.

01:22:16.245 --> 01:22:20.306
<i>I would like a 12-gauge
pump-action riot gun,</i>

01:22:20.382 --> 01:22:21.940
<i>with an 18-inch barrel,</i>

01:22:22.017 --> 01:22:25.783
<i>a magazine extender,
and four boxes of.</i>

01:22:26.922 --> 01:22:28.355
O- O buck.

01:22:30.225 --> 01:22:31.715
Double-aught?

01:22:31.793 --> 01:22:33.556
Right. Double-aught.

01:22:34.596 --> 01:22:36.393
<i>You know, I'm gonna have
to see a driver's license</i>

01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:38.399
or some other proof
of residency.

01:22:39.902 --> 01:22:41.870
Here you go.
Thanks.

01:22:44.172 --> 01:22:46.197
You need a riot gun?

01:22:47.175 --> 01:22:48.540
Gophers.

01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:28.474
You have a permit for this?

01:23:29.017 --> 01:23:30.245
This is all there is.

01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:32.787
<i>Oh, Lila,
I don't want your money.</i>

01:23:33.989 --> 01:23:36.355
I just wanna tell you
a couple of jokes.

01:23:36.425 --> 01:23:38.825
Did you hear the one about
the traveling cocaine salesman?

01:23:38.894 --> 01:23:41.089
<i>What the hell do you want?
Oh, you're gonna like this.</i>

01:23:41.163 --> 01:23:43.222
Stop me if you've heard it.

01:23:43.298 --> 01:23:46.665
It seems like he's got
a couple of partners.

01:23:47.436 --> 01:23:50.098
People who could really cause him
a lot of trouble if they talked.

01:23:50.172 --> 01:23:52.197
<i>I don't know what you're
talking about. Lila, Lila.</i>

01:23:52.274 --> 01:23:55.402
And I'd like you to leave.
You are throwing off my timing.

01:23:55.477 --> 01:23:58.310
<i>Now, things were
going along great</i>

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:02.510
<i>until this sweet little girl
found out about their evil doings,</i>

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:03.983
and they killed her.

01:24:04.052 --> 01:24:05.110
Case closed.

01:24:05.187 --> 01:24:08.054
Except this friend
of hers decided

01:24:08.123 --> 01:24:10.318
he wasn't gonna let them
get away with it.

01:24:10.392 --> 01:24:12.292
That's the part I play.

01:24:12.995 --> 01:24:14.553
What part does she play?

01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:16.153
Bonnie Parker.

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:20.958
<i>Now, things started
falling apart</i>

01:24:21.036 --> 01:24:23.561
<i>for the traveling cocaine
salesman when the investigator,</i>

01:24:23.638 --> 01:24:25.538
<i>me, started getting
closer and closer,</i>

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:28.633
because somebody talked.

01:24:33.248 --> 01:24:34.510
It wasn't me.

01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:36.642
No.

01:24:37.786 --> 01:24:40.346
So he starts killing
everybody he suspects.

01:24:40.422 --> 01:24:42.515
Bang. Bang.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.192
I'm not telling you anything.

01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:49.389
<i>No, here's the punchline.
He doesn't know that.</i>

01:24:57.906 --> 01:25:01.307
<i>It must be my delivery. I
never could tell a joke, Bonnie.</i>

01:25:01.376 --> 01:25:03.742
<i>Anyway, here's what
I think we should do.</i>

01:25:03.812 --> 01:25:05.803
I think we should call...

01:25:07.716 --> 01:25:09.206
Anton Peters.

01:25:10.485 --> 01:25:12.612
I think we should call him
and tell him the good news.

01:25:12.687 --> 01:25:14.814
That we have found the leak.

01:25:15.757 --> 01:25:17.554
He won't believe you.

01:25:17.659 --> 01:25:19.820
Do you really want to
take that chance?

01:25:21.263 --> 01:25:22.525
<i>Look, he'll kill me.</i>

01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:23.894
Not if he's in jail.

01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:25.865
Where's the exchange
taking place?

01:25:26.168 --> 01:25:28.659
<i>I don't know!
Lila, the joke's over.</i>

01:25:31.139 --> 01:25:33.164
<i>What do I have to do,
dial 9 to get out?</i>

01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:36.210
<i>Look, you don't understand.
He's going to kill me!</i>

01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:38.407
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.744
<i>Look, I mean, I can't
make you any promises,</i>

01:25:40.816 --> 01:25:43.216
<i>but I've worked on a lot
of these cases before,</i>

01:25:43.318 --> 01:25:45.183
and I'm sure that you
can get police protection.

01:25:45.253 --> 01:25:46.811
<i>I mean, maybe even immunity.</i>

01:25:46.888 --> 01:25:48.981
I had nothing to do
with Marti's death.

01:25:49.057 --> 01:25:51.287
So that makes your case
that much stronger.

01:25:51.359 --> 01:25:53.190
There's two scenarios.

01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:55.593
You can tell us where
the meeting's taking place.

01:25:55.664 --> 01:25:58.326
<i>You stay here and keep quiet, and
he never has to know you talked,</i>

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.027
or I place the call.

01:26:17.085 --> 01:26:18.347
Where's Frank?

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.910
He'll be here.

01:26:21.456 --> 01:26:24.084
I left a message for him
at his office.

01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:34.459
Where's Frank?

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.230
<i>Thomas, it's going down.</i>

01:26:40.609 --> 01:26:42.372
What're we gonna do?

01:26:50.685 --> 01:26:52.619
They're making the exchange.

01:26:56.491 --> 01:26:57.617
Who's that with Jesse?

01:26:57.692 --> 01:26:59.125
Anton Peters.

01:26:59.194 --> 01:27:00.525
Here.

01:27:09.037 --> 01:27:10.834
They're gonna get away.

01:27:13.575 --> 01:27:15.167
<i>No, they aren't.</i>

01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:18.636
Hang on!

01:28:40.962 --> 01:28:42.862
<i>Thomas, there's something
I have to tell you.</i>

01:28:42.931 --> 01:28:44.057
What?

01:28:45.767 --> 01:28:47.997
What?
I lied.

01:28:48.136 --> 01:28:51.105
I knew that we were ripping
off Robin Masters' book.

01:28:51.172 --> 01:28:54.164
<i>I mean I didn't know at
first, but the writer knew it,</i>

01:28:54.242 --> 01:28:55.709
<i>and by the time I found out,</i>

01:28:55.777 --> 01:28:57.870
I'd already asked
all my friends to invest.

01:28:57.946 --> 01:29:00.414
<i>They're dentists, and they put
up their whole life savings,</i>

01:29:00.482 --> 01:29:03.508
and I just didn't have the guts
to tell them that we'd been had.

01:29:03.585 --> 01:29:07.521
<i>Well, don't worry about it. We'll figure
something out right after we get married.</i>

01:29:08.056 --> 01:29:09.114
What did you say?

01:29:17.632 --> 01:29:18.758
What did you say?

01:29:18.833 --> 01:29:20.926
I said we'll figure
something out.

01:29:21.002 --> 01:29:23.197
<i>No, after that. You asked
me to marry you. I did?</i>

01:29:23.271 --> 01:29:25.466
You said after we get married.
I didn't mean to say that.

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:28.065
<i>You didn't mean to ask me to
marry you? No, I meant to ask you.</i>

01:29:28.143 --> 01:29:29.440
I just didn't mean
to ask you now.

01:29:29.511 --> 01:29:32.309
Of all the ridiculous places
to ask somebody to marry you!

01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:54.925
Freeze!

01:29:59.207 --> 01:30:01.471
<i>Ciao, amigo. Come on, Peters, out of there.</i>

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.575
<i>Gee, Frank, I thought
you'd never get here.</i>

01:30:09.084 --> 01:30:10.711
Let's go.

01:30:18.259 --> 01:30:19.521
Yes.

01:30:29.904 --> 01:30:31.166
Yes?

01:30:45.487 --> 01:30:46.681
Yes.

01:31:31.666 --> 01:31:34.362
<i>I can't tell you what
kind of surprise, Higgins.</i>

01:31:34.436 --> 01:31:36.267
Just ask T. C...

01:31:36.771 --> 01:31:39.205
<i>I know. I know I was
supposed to check in, Higgins,</i>

01:31:39.274 --> 01:31:41.037
but I have been a little busy.

01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:44.169
Just ask T.C. If he can
pick me up at the airport

01:31:44.245 --> 01:31:45.507
and have him stop by the florist

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.480
and pick up the most
beautiful lei they've got.

01:31:47.549 --> 01:31:49.483
<i>And a Lima.
I gotta go, I gotta go.</i>

01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:51.781
<i>A final note
on the American dream.</i>

01:31:51.853 --> 01:31:55.414
<i>There are exactly enough for
each person to have his own.</i>

01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:58.721
<i>And the trick is not
so much in going after it</i>

01:31:58.793 --> 01:32:00.920
<i>but recognizing it
when it comes along.</i>

01:32:00.995 --> 01:32:02.622
<i>Skycab, you busy?</i>

01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.095
You got luggage?
Yeah.

01:32:04.165 --> 01:32:07.828
<i>I mean, I don't have any,
but there's some coming. Lots.</i>

01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:17.075
It'll be here any minute.

01:32:17.145 --> 01:32:18.442
<i>Mr. Thomas Magnum,</i>

01:32:18.513 --> 01:32:20.208
<i>to a white courtesy
phone please.</i>

01:32:20.281 --> 01:32:21.373
<i>Mr. Thomas Magnum.</i>

01:32:21.449 --> 01:32:23.246
I'll be right back.

01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:34.454
<i>This is Thomas Magnum.
One moment, sir.</i>

01:32:34.529 --> 01:32:36.724
<i>This better be good, Higgins.</i>

01:32:38.299 --> 01:32:39.891
<i>Thomas?</i>

01:32:46.207 --> 01:32:48.300
<i>You're not coming, are you?</i>

01:32:53.314 --> 01:32:55.179
I want to.

01:32:57.986 --> 01:32:59.647
But not just now?

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:05.551
Please. I...

01:33:07.295 --> 01:33:08.626
It's okay.

01:33:09.397 --> 01:33:11.490
It's okay. Listen...

01:33:14.936 --> 01:33:18.201
Does this have something
to do with Bill?

01:33:19.274 --> 01:33:20.502
<i>Bill?</i>

01:33:20.775 --> 01:33:22.743
<i>Well, you know, I mean, you...</i>

01:33:24.312 --> 01:33:28.180
<i>You wouldn't talk about him
much, and I just figured...</i>

01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:32.852
<i>Oh, God, Thomas.</i>

01:33:34.522 --> 01:33:38.925
I never talked about Bill
because he was such a jerk.

01:33:38.993 --> 01:33:42.759
I was embarrassed to admit
that I ever went out with him.

01:33:43.998 --> 01:33:45.898
<i>No, this has nothing...</i>

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.468
<i>It has nothing to do
with anybody else,</i>

01:33:48.536 --> 01:33:51.972
except...
Except for you and...

01:33:52.674 --> 01:33:54.232
<i>And for me,</i>

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:59.378
and then the fact that
it just all happened so fast.

01:34:01.716 --> 01:34:02.876
Yeah.

01:34:03.518 --> 01:34:07.511
I guess I'm getting
impulsive in my old age.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.863
<i>Look, there are some
things that I have to</i>

01:34:21.936 --> 01:34:26.270
take care of here.
Some obligations.

01:34:26.608 --> 01:34:29.975
<i>And then I'd like to...</i>

01:34:30.912 --> 01:34:32.504
<i>come over.</i>

01:34:34.148 --> 01:34:35.775
Spend some time with you.

01:34:37.485 --> 01:34:40.045
<i>You know, see how much
we like each other,</i>

01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:44.454
without all the drama.

01:34:46.995 --> 01:34:48.428
I'll be there.

01:34:56.771 --> 01:34:58.033
Thomas...

01:35:08.783 --> 01:35:10.444
<i>I love you, too.</i>
