Well he better hurry up

02:57.677 --> 03:00.220

There you go, man.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.356

05:19.235 --> 05:21.153
Just be careful backing up.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.997

They're right in the back.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.920
We need them belts.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.049
What about Tim?
The fancy Escalade?

05:42.133 --> 05:45.927
I don't know, thinks I soId
him some bad dope or something.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.098
Did ya'?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.308
Probably.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.855
Damn it, I forgot my wrenches.
I'll be right back.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.608
I'll go, all right?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.777
AII right.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.247
Fucker.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.459
WeII, heIIo, Cody.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.130
Shade.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.174
Haven't seen you in awhiIe.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.884
Yeah I've just been Iaying Iow

06:25.927 --> 06:28.387
after all that drama
went down last month.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.138
It's by the heater.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.599
And don't forget those
are my tooIs,

06:32.683 --> 06:34.267
you guys are always
losing my stuff.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.228
All right. Yeah.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.980
What did you do
yourseIf? ReaIIy?

06:39.065 --> 06:42.067
Again? Ugh, get over here.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.486
No, I'm fine. I gotta go.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.571
No no, over here now.

06:51.661 --> 06:57.165
Ugh. Off, come on.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.168
Come here.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.088
Put your
hand there.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.026
Gimme that.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.112
Now you shouId
reaIIy consider

07:27.196 --> 07:32.033
changing up your IifestyIe, buddy.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.789
Yeah, I don't think change
is much of an option for me, Shade.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.209
I worry about you, Cody.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.756
What are you doing?

07:46.841 --> 07:50.886
Sh. You know you can tell
a lot about a person

07:50.970 --> 07:53.305
just by reading their paIm.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.724
What does mine say?

07:55.808 --> 07:59.144
I have no idea.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.480
Haven't gotten that far
in the book yet.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.398
Gimme my hand back.

08:08.112 --> 08:12.574
Tomboy wannabe palm reader
who looks like a cover model.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.993
God just insists
on giving me lunatics

08:15.036 --> 08:17.078
for family members,
doesn't he?

08:18.539 --> 08:20.081
Look good? How do I look?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.542
Amazing, go get 'em.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.669
I'll see you
at the party tonight?

08:24.754 --> 08:32.177
Yeah.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.850
I love you, cuz!

08:51.364 --> 08:52.948

08:54.742 --> 08:56.701
We gotta hit the road "Code,"

08:56.786 --> 09:00.038
takes three hours
almost to get up
to the farmhouse.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.374
I know how long it takes.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.626
AII I'm saying is your mom
and Shade Ieft awhiIe ago

09:04.710 --> 09:07.712
and you know how your mom
gets when we're late.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.674
That's troubIe I don't want.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.467
It's not gonna happen today, Cody.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.594
Just leave the bike here,
we'll fix it tomorrow.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.639
Okay, stuck with you
fucking clowns.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.966
Come on man, Iighten up,
it's your mom's 50th birthday.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.861
Whew!

10:12.945 --> 10:15.572
All right. Let's party.

10:19.619 --> 10:24.039
Man, it's a damn shame no one
really comes up here anymore.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.083
Place just sits
up here empty.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.794
We had some good
times, didn't we, brother?

10:29.879 --> 10:32.339
Good times.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.007
Yeah.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.718
Elroy, back in the day,

10:36.802 --> 10:39.721
this place was the spot, man.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.223
I'm telling you,
gambling, drugs,

10:42.308 --> 10:45.977
back door business,
no cops.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.730
Had my first hooker up here.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.357
I was 12.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.152
See these boys?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.696
Hey, boys!

11:19.970 --> 11:21.846
Oh!

11:21.931 --> 11:24.766
How's my prince?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.351
Happy birthday, Mom.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.895
Oooh.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.278
How you doin',
Uncle Linus?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.280
Good to see ya'.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.574
Oh.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.746
I didn't really know
you were going to be here

11:46.831 --> 11:49.290
It's my mom's
birthday, Michelle.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.418
Yeah.

11:51.502 --> 11:56.506
You remember Dave,
right? He's my old man now.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.885
We've met before, right?

12:00.970 --> 12:03.888
Yeah, like three times.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.892
Well Michelle, six months.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.062
You sure move on
quick, don't ya?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.981
Hey, Cody, Cody.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.692
Get your mom a drink.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.277
Happy birthday.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.947
Get your mom
a drink, boy.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.742
It's stupid in here.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.618
Come on.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.421
Hey, what's up?
Haven't seen you around here before.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.965
My name's Elroy,
I wrench for Cody and Q.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.593
Hi. I'm Megan.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.429
Damn shame no one comes
around here anymore.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.265
Back in the day
this used to be the spot.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.099
Really?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.976
Mm.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.188
That's odd. I can't recall
seeing you here before.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.106
Huh?

12:55.191 --> 12:59.986
You know, since my dad's
an original member and all.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.655
Don't try so hard, rookie.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.999
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

14:37.543 --> 14:40.044
Your Uncle Linus
isn't feeling real well

14:40.087 --> 14:42.547
so I gotta get him home.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.424
Love you, baby.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.720
And be good.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.078
Fuck you man!

15:14.121 --> 15:16.080
Hey! Hey!

15:16.165 --> 15:18.416
Not in my house, hey!

15:39.355 --> 15:41.814
You don't remember me,
do you Cody?

15:41.899 --> 15:45.443
Megan. Michelle's little sister.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.821
Megan.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.533
How long
has it been?

15:52.618 --> 15:57.997
Um, I think
I was 17 the last
time I saw you.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.459
Just before
I left for school.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.962
How'd that
work out for you?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.298
I graduated last semester.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.967
Right.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.308
Anyway, I heard it was
your mom's birthday

16:17.393 --> 16:20.103
so I tagged along
with my sister.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.189
Sorry it didn't
work out between you guys.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.900
Seven years is a Iong time.

16:25.985 --> 16:31.698
And weII, now she's running
around with that douche bag.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.413
Well.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.415
I just wanted to say hi.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.583
Um, I should probably
go find Michelle

16:42.668 --> 16:45.461
before she leaves me
stranded once again.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.216
Megan.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.598
Couple years back
when I got locked up,

16:57.683 --> 17:02.729
I knew it was
you that sent me
those letters.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.606
Thanks for the beer.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.192
It was good to see you, Cody.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.878
better take off man,
it's getting Iate.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.757
Hey.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.467
Let's get
outta here.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.760
Yeah?

17:37.556 --> 17:41.809
Yo, man, everybody's Ieaving.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.437
You want me to drive Mama?

17:44.521 --> 17:46.773
Don't be stupid.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.077
Yoo hoo!

18:06.376 --> 18:08.669
Hey, have you guys
seen my sister?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.964
Oh, my God, honey,
it is an angry coIIege person.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.557
Are you kidding me?
Did she leave?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.268
Maybe she went
on a beer run.

18:24.311 --> 18:28.564
Maybe she did, except that
there's nothing around here for miIes.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.820
Do you guys mind
if I catch a ride with you?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.614
Sure thing honey, but you
better get comfortabIe

18:36.698 --> 18:38.116
'cause we ain't
leaving till the morning.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.326
Are you serious?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.411
Do I look serious?

18:42.496 --> 18:45.456
I'm sorry, baby, but everyone's already left.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.208
Sorry, baby.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.711
WeII, who's that?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.965
You better go find out
if you want a ride..

19:24.329 --> 19:26.247
Hello?

19:28.959 --> 19:31.169
Anyone out there?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.502
Crazy mother fucker, your old man.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.421
Sick one.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.756
Yeah.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.132
Here.

21:02.636 --> 21:07.265
What were we,
like 5 and 10?

21:07.349 --> 21:08.975
Something like that.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.769
Born into The Crew.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.772
Bred to be fearless.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.607
AII we've ever known.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.859
AII we've ever known.

21:18.944 --> 21:23.698
Look, I know this is going to sound like

21:23.782 --> 21:27.201
some club house bullshit

21:27.286 --> 21:29.620
but the old timers,

21:29.705 --> 21:33.833
they want you to do
a chump border run.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.460
Prove your loyalty to the Crew.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.338
Is that right?

21:42.009 --> 21:46.345
Border runs are for
rookies and prospects.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.641
I was born in.

21:50.684 --> 21:56.314
I've given my Iife
to The Crew.

21:58.525 --> 22:03.904
You fucked up bad, man.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.366
You exposed us.

22:07.451 --> 22:12.330
You know we're not in a position
to mess with the damn Russians

22:12.414 --> 22:14.498
or the Gangbangers.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.174
And if I refuse?

22:23.258 --> 22:28.054
What do you want me
to say, Cody?

22:30.932 --> 22:33.684
HeIp me.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.524
Help me!

23:12.849 --> 23:15.976
Wake up.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.730
PIease, wake up, MicheIIe.
Just wake up now.

23:19.773 --> 23:23.067
You're going to be okay.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.819
No, we can't just Ieave them.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.737
You know how far
the hospital is
from here.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.572
Where were you at?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.790
Oh, shit.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.625
What the f--

23:56.101 --> 23:57.351
He's dead.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.520
What the fuck?

23:59.604 --> 24:03.566
What the shit man?
She didn't hit nothing.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.527
Well it had to be something.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.321
How the fuck
did this happen?

24:11.867 --> 24:13.951
Maybe it was a bear?

24:14.035 --> 24:16.996
Okay, don't taIk, okay?

24:17.080 --> 24:22.460
Not anymore, you aren't allowed
to talk anymore. Understand me?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.173
Come on.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.385
Come on!

24:31.470 --> 24:33.971
Fuck!

24:41.813 --> 24:42.980
Oh.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.824
This shit's not working, man.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.243
Put it in neutral, Elroy.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.886
Oh honey, what on
earth are you doing?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.221
Come on!

25:15.305 --> 25:17.181
It's fucking dead!

25:17.265 --> 25:20.559
The fuck do you mean
my truck is dead?

25:20.644 --> 25:24.688
That thing was running perfectly,
Cody, I swear to God.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.232
Hold on, hold on.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.622
How is she?

25:41.706 --> 25:46.126
Could be bleeding internally.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.963
She needs help, Cody.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.756
I'm working on that.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.883
What do you mean?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.639
We got a serious problem.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.599
Truck's not working.

26:00.684 --> 26:05.062
Everything's lined up,
it's just, just dead.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.570
See what I'm saying?

26:16.741 --> 26:19.535
This can't be happening, Q.

26:19.619 --> 26:24.248
It's way too far
to walk back to town.

26:24.332 --> 26:28.252
We put somebody out on
the road, try to flag down a car.

26:28.336 --> 26:33.507
At 2 in the morning? We'd have better
luck just walking the 30 miles, man.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.551
Plus, we don't know
what's out there.

26:38.930 --> 26:42.516
What about the old
hermit up the way?

26:42.601 --> 26:46.478
Will you watch my sister for me?
I'm gonna go try my cell phone again.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.729
I'm sorry! Is this okay?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.238
Fuck.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.116
You're, you're okay with that?

28:23.451 --> 28:24.451
Yeah?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.786
Oh!

28:56.776 --> 28:57.651
Ugh.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.257
Get the fuck off of her!

29:20.341 --> 29:22.509
Shade, get her out of here.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.691
Shade, get something
to tie her down with!

29:37.776 --> 29:39.693
Fuck you!

29:42.405 --> 29:46.700
Mother fuckers!

30:10.517 --> 30:13.143
Stop it! You're hurting her!

30:14.729 --> 30:17.189
Come on, gimme.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.817
Hurry up Q, I don't know
how much Ionger I can hoId her.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.698
Holy fuck, she's strong.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.622
All right. Stop it!

30:37.877 --> 30:42.506
What the fuck are you doing?
Just don't stand there, help him!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.798
It's okay.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.886
Okay?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.053
Okay.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.433
Elroy, hang in there, man,

31:34.517 --> 31:38.645
we're going to get you
some help okay, I promise.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.155
EIroy's not gonna
make it another hour.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.575
Fuck! I'm going to kill
that fucking bitch!

31:55.955 --> 31:57.831
You can't lose it, man.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.750
I need you here with me.

31:59.792 --> 32:02.419
Don't fucking lose it?
Don't fucking lose it?

32:02.462 --> 32:08.508
That cunt! She tried to kill Elroy.
See his fucking face?

32:08.593 --> 32:13.680
AII we can do now is get
them out of here and get heIp.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.807
All right, what are you thinking?

32:15.892 --> 32:19.436
The oId hermit Iives
a coupIe miIes up the road.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.105
I'm gonna hike it up there.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.107
Doesn't have a phone,

32:24.192 --> 32:27.611
but maybe in the last
six months he's gotten a car.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.447
It's worth a fucking shot.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.951
AII right, I'II stay on the truck.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.673
Hey brother.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.803
Guess I forget

32:52.845 --> 32:55.722
you used to love that girl.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.451
Wilmer?

34:43.039 --> 34:44.998
Hey, old man,
are you in there?

34:55.967 --> 34:57.928
WiImer?

34:58.012 --> 35:00.806
Is that you?

35:32.171 --> 35:34.214
Wilmer?

35:34.298 --> 35:38.051
Is that you?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.470
No!

35:44.058 --> 35:45.725
You can't make me!

35:49.480 --> 35:50.730
You'II have to find someone eIse!

35:56.737 --> 35:58.572
Michelle?

36:05.496 --> 36:07.164
Michelle?

36:08.624 --> 36:10.333
Shade?

36:14.755 --> 36:16.214
Why--

36:16.299 --> 36:18.842
Why am I tied up?

36:18.885 --> 36:22.345
You tried to eat Elroy's face, honey.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.931
What?

36:27.185 --> 36:30.103
Where's Dave at?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.647
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.149
I've read about this. Okay?

36:34.233 --> 36:35.317
What?

37:36.837 --> 37:41.216
Do you think he had something
to do with Michelle and Dave?

37:41.300 --> 37:45.470
What did you get
yourseIf into, oId man?

37:45.554 --> 37:48.098
There's something inside you?

37:48.140 --> 37:50.016
What is it?

37:50.101 --> 37:54.104
Please, why are
you doing this to me?

37:54.146 --> 37:56.648
What do you want froMus?

37:56.732 --> 37:58.775
Are you looking for someone?

37:58.818 --> 38:00.277
What?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.653
What do you want?

38:03.656 --> 38:06.324
Please Shade,

38:06.409 --> 38:09.327
I don't... Something's...
Something's wrong!

38:12.707 --> 38:15.458
Michelle, come back to me!
Come on Michelle.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.585
Something's wrong with me!

38:19.672 --> 38:22.382
Q! Q! Q!

39:02.840 --> 39:04.424
Q!

39:06.135 --> 39:08.261
Q!

39:11.849 --> 39:13.183
Q!

39:24.028 --> 39:25.320
What happened?

39:25.404 --> 39:28.365
She got out. She's in there.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.745
Get back.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.599
I'm gonna end this now.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.936
Ah!

40:05.319 --> 40:07.112
No, baby. No. No.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.322
It's okay.

40:32.388 --> 40:35.682
Shit, I don't like this, Q.
Where the fuck is she?

40:51.824 --> 40:55.743
Where are you at,
you bloody bitch?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.857
Q.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.903
Q?

41:32.072 --> 41:33.323
The fuck happened?

41:33.365 --> 41:34.574
Michelle!

41:37.203 --> 41:38.953
What did you do to my sister?

41:39.038 --> 41:41.998
What did I do?

41:42.082 --> 41:45.210
Bitch was in there
crawling on the ceiling.

41:45.294 --> 41:49.422
Open the door. I want to see her.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.053
Be my guest.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.864
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.295
Jesus.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.714
How did she?

42:31.799 --> 42:34.050
I think with those.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.221
Oh, fuck me!

42:42.393 --> 42:44.602
Oh MicheIIe,
we gotta cIean you up.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.607
Yeah. I wouldn't do that.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.901
She gets a little touchy.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.487
Oh, my God.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.690
What the hell happened?

43:30.774 --> 43:33.651
There's something inside her.

43:33.736 --> 43:37.071
Something really fucking evil.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.371
Time to abandon
ship, brother.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.291
What are you
talking about, Q?

43:48.334 --> 43:50.793
We've done all we can.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.714
If we Ieave, they both die.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.883
Can you live with that?

43:56.967 --> 43:59.093
I'm not leaving my sister.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.471
We all know,

44:01.555 --> 44:06.017
that thing in there,
is not your sister.

44:06.101 --> 44:08.686
Shade's my only priority now.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.064
Shade is my blood.

44:11.148 --> 44:13.900
You're my best friend.

44:13.984 --> 44:18.988
But we are not leaving people here.
Do you understand me?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.741
Cody's right, Q.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.994
We gotta stay and help them.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.497
I'm taking Shade,

44:27.581 --> 44:29.999
and uh,

44:30.084 --> 44:33.044
we're leaving now.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.004
Come on.

44:35.047 --> 44:38.675
I never took you
for a coward, Q.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.225
Ugh!

44:48.769 --> 44:50.603
Was I the one,

44:50.688 --> 44:53.439
was I the one who bitched out
to the East Bay posse?

44:53.524 --> 44:55.233
Admit it!

44:55.317 --> 44:57.068
Admit it!

44:57.152 --> 45:00.238
You fucked up last month
'cause you're the coward!

45:00.322 --> 45:02.365
You're the coward!

45:02.449 --> 45:04.283
Cody, don't. He'll kill you.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.089
Come on!

45:23.554 --> 45:25.096
Come on.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.222
Ugh!

45:44.742 --> 45:45.783
Q! Don't!

45:56.670 --> 45:59.922
You had enough?
You had enough?

46:29.369 --> 46:33.206
What's it gonna be?

46:33.290 --> 46:35.708
You know that Cody once toId me

46:35.793 --> 46:39.045
that he only trusted
one person in this world.

46:39.129 --> 46:41.005
I guess he was wrong.

46:49.139 --> 46:50.723
Fine.

46:50.808 --> 46:54.560
You let him
take care of you then.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.556
What the hell?

48:28.614 --> 48:30.072
Fuck!

48:30.115 --> 48:31.532
Fuck!

48:35.037 --> 48:37.914
Do you know why
I wrote you all those letters?

48:37.998 --> 48:40.249
'Cause Michelle wouldn't?

48:41.710 --> 48:42.919
The park fair.

48:44.504 --> 48:47.256
You took me there when I was 13.

48:47.299 --> 48:50.760
Remember? You used
to come to town every summer.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.929
I was begging Michelle
to take me for weeks,

48:53.013 --> 48:54.931
and all of a sudden you showed up

48:55.015 --> 48:58.309
and you picked me up in that
ugly primered car of yours.

48:58.393 --> 49:01.479
And no one could believe that Cody McKay

49:01.563 --> 49:03.981
picked me up
and took me to the fair.

49:04.066 --> 49:07.610
I was the coolest girl
in school for weeks.

49:07.694 --> 49:11.280
All because of a simple gesture.

49:11.365 --> 49:16.369
I'm aware of all the things you've done.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.704
All the violence,

49:18.789 --> 49:23.209
but between your uncle and my dad,

49:23.293 --> 49:25.711
and losing your father,

49:25.796 --> 49:30.132
you never really had a
chance and that's not fair.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.222
What is that?

49:52.072 --> 49:53.489
Elroy!

49:53.573 --> 49:54.824
Shit!

50:00.288 --> 50:02.748
You shouId not be up.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.042
Hey, do you have a beer?

50:05.127 --> 50:07.420
I don't think you want
a beer right now.

50:07.504 --> 50:11.799
No no no, a beer sounds
amazing right now.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.762
Sure, Elroy.

51:02.350 --> 51:04.810
Yeah, oh, yeah.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.480
What are you doing
out here man?

51:07.564 --> 51:11.233
What the fuck are you
doing out here, Dave?

51:11.318 --> 51:14.570
I don't know, man.

51:14.613 --> 51:20.076
but it's been
a really weird night.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.453
Me and, uh,

51:22.537 --> 51:24.580
Michelle.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.126
We got hella high, bro.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.593
What's the matter, Q?

51:37.636 --> 51:39.637
Shit man,

51:39.721 --> 51:42.473
you were dead a few
hours ago, you asshole.

51:49.856 --> 51:52.149
What are we doing after this?

51:57.906 --> 52:01.283
Sh.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.453
You hear that?

52:10.168 --> 52:11.836
EIroy,

52:11.920 --> 52:15.005
are you all right?

52:15.090 --> 52:17.758
Why?

52:19.427 --> 52:21.512
Hey, what's that noise?

52:29.563 --> 52:31.939
I don't hear anything.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.363
It sounds pretty.

52:39.447 --> 52:42.825
Like music.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.415
Holy shit!

52:49.499 --> 52:51.292
Hell, yeah!

52:53.336 --> 52:54.712
Guys, the fucking thing is working!

52:54.796 --> 52:56.422
What did you do?

52:56.506 --> 52:58.549
I don't know, but who cares?
God!

52:58.633 --> 53:01.468
Hey, Shade. I'm totaIIy
feeIing better now.

53:01.553 --> 53:03.345
Are you aII right?

53:03.430 --> 53:05.389
Elroy, we gotta get you
into the truck, okay?

53:05.473 --> 53:07.600
That sound, its Iike that song,

53:07.684 --> 53:09.935
what the hell
is that song?

54:17.003 --> 54:19.964
Thank you.

54:20.048 --> 54:23.133
For what?

54:26.471 --> 54:30.516
You saw me different.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.935
Cody.

54:33.019 --> 54:35.437
It's gone dead.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.046
Ugh!

56:05.070 --> 56:07.654
Whoo! Come on big feIIa!

56:43.483 --> 56:45.067
Hey.

56:45.151 --> 56:49.405
Hey, hey, hey.

56:49.447 --> 56:52.825
Loverboy is awake!

56:52.909 --> 56:54.576
Hey, loverboy.

56:54.661 --> 56:58.247
Oh! You Iooking for this?

57:01.084 --> 57:03.168
All this sweet puss loverboy,

57:03.253 --> 57:06.171
and you keep it to your self?

57:09.426 --> 57:10.884
Ah.

57:16.349 --> 57:17.933
What do you want?

57:17.976 --> 57:19.977
Want?

57:21.938 --> 57:24.773
We just heard there's a
wild party here tonight?

57:24.816 --> 57:27.860
And we weren't
invited, now is that true?

57:27.944 --> 57:28.861
Huh?

57:28.945 --> 57:31.405
Who are you?

57:31.489 --> 57:35.367
Do you have any idea whose
house you just set foot in?

57:35.452 --> 57:37.786
All right, all right.

57:37.871 --> 57:42.958
All right. Before we all get into a
hissy fit and start raising a ruckus,

57:43.001 --> 57:45.794
you're right! We should all
go round the room

57:45.837 --> 57:49.173
and learn each other's names.
Proper like. Me first, I'm Vernon.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.633
This handsome
gentleman over here

57:51.718 --> 57:54.344
with the switchblade, that's Jazz.

57:56.055 --> 57:57.556
I'm shy.

57:57.640 --> 58:01.602
Ba-dat-dat-dat-da-dat!!

58:03.521 --> 58:05.814
Greetings and salutations.

58:05.857 --> 58:07.649
And that other
gentleman over there

58:07.734 --> 58:10.319
with the earphones,
that's, Murderball!

58:10.361 --> 58:12.988
MurderbaII, MurderbaII, MurderbaII.

58:13.072 --> 58:16.575
He's a little
on the quiet side.

58:16.659 --> 58:19.161
The two fine young
specimens in the back

58:19.204 --> 58:22.664
hanging out, that's
Trixie and Pussywagon.

58:22.749 --> 58:25.542
Hi, loverboy.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.920
Oh, they like you.

58:28.004 --> 58:32.508
We're just a friendIy bunch,
Iooking for a good time.

58:32.550 --> 58:36.678
The violent kind.

58:36.763 --> 58:39.681
So, now, loverboy,

58:39.724 --> 58:42.351
what's your name?

58:44.562 --> 58:46.271
Ew.

58:47.690 --> 58:50.108
What's you name. Hm?

58:50.193 --> 58:52.611
Cody.

58:52.695 --> 58:56.031
Cody. Now how 'bout the girls?
What's their names?

58:56.115 --> 58:57.950
Megan.

58:58.034 --> 58:59.076
Shade.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.578
Megan and Shade.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.247
Now those are pretty names.

59:03.331 --> 59:05.791
You see Megan
and Shade over there,

59:05.875 --> 59:09.211
they were scratching up oI' MurderbaII
so we had to wrap 'eMup!

59:09.295 --> 59:13.382
MurderbaII just
Iooooves his pIastic.

59:15.009 --> 59:16.885
Is it time yet, please?

59:16.970 --> 59:21.974
No, no Jazz it's not time yet.
Have some patience!

59:22.058 --> 59:24.601
The show hasn't even begun!

59:24.686 --> 59:27.980
Now, it's been reaI nice
meeting aII of you. But,

59:28.064 --> 59:31.733
this isn't all of you now is it? Hm?

59:31.776 --> 59:35.112
I'll give you one more chance,
round up all your friends,

59:35.196 --> 59:37.155
and get the fuck out of here.

59:45.081 --> 59:47.833
Wow, you said that
with such conviction.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.252
So hero-Iike.

59:50.336 --> 59:58.093
I count three of you, but I feel
like somebody's missing.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:03.932
Of the female persuasion.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.855
There's no one else.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.027
Now, lying is a weakness Cody.
And you ain't weak!

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.614
You're a strong boy,
I can see it in ya.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.199
What do you want froMus?

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.785
We're here for the girI, Ioverboy,

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:25.871
try and keep up.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:31.043
You're not touching
either of them.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:33.045
I don't think you're
in the position to negotiate,

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:36.340
and besides, we're not here
for Megan and Shade.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.675
We're looking
for the other one.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.510
Don't you fucking touch my sister!

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.346
Now there
is some truth!

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.389
Megan, you gotta stay quiet.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.852
Sh. Baby, we're
not gonna touch her.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.854
We didn't come here
for your sister.

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:54.816
We came here for what's
inside of her.

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:59.571
Michelle doesn't mean
harm to anyone.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.158
Michelle. Michelle!

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:05.577
Another pretty name.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.331
GirIs! Put another record on!

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.083
This one's a real drag. Whoo!

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:14.169
Time for some fun.
Some fun and games!

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.254
Whoo! Nothing better
than fun and games!

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.174
Except for a good
ol' fashioned drag race!

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.847
Ya'll like to dance, right?

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.615
Hm. Yeah, get in here Murderball.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.034
Whoo!

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.911
Whoo!

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.580
FeeIing good! Yeah!

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.082
Whoo hoo hoo!

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:10.016
Whoo! Lemonade and dancing,
I Iove this country!

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.852
It's enough!

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:14.479
I don't think it is enough.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.783
It's reaI simpIe,
just teII us where she is.

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:40.422
Now's the real fun
and games, finally!

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.924
You let them go
and I won't hurt her.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.886
Her? Go ahead, see if I care

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.721
I said Iet them go, now!

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.559
Okay Cody, we will.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.606
Ah!

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:03.612
I'm digging
your style bamalam
but you are wearing on me.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:06.656
Tell me where Michelle is.

01:03:10.703 --> 01:03:12.287
She's not here,
I swear to God!

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:15.457
Don't swear,
I don't like swearing.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:36.812
Is that aII you got, Ioverboy?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.855
Whoo!

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:42.984
Whoo!

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.325
Leave him alone!

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:51.701
Whoo!

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.245
Stop!

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.916
Whoo hoo hoo!

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.834
I love this! I'm coming!

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.091
HeII, Iadies, put on
some fighting music!

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.760
You just earned yourself
another chance.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.012
A chance to kill me,
if you can.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:13.181
Whoo hoo hoo!

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.432
Cody!

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.603
Kick it up a notch,
Pussywagon! Yeah!

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.526
Hey, you ever see Jimmy Dean
in "Rebel"? Hm?

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.611
Jimmy Dean and this tough
guy from another gang

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.739
get into a knife fight at the Griffith
Observatory in L.A.,

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.449
It's a terrific fiIm,
Cody, you gotta see it.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.785
Okay, come on, now.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.290
You're the tough guy
and I'm good oI' James
Dean, the hero.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.917
AII right. CircIe me
and attack.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:42.419
Whoo!

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:44.129
Attack me! Yeah!

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.884
You got it. You got it. Okay, now,

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.468
call me chicken.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.972
Oh! No! Don't
swing at me yet.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:56.641
Call me chicken!

01:04:58.102 --> 01:04:59.519
You're a fucking chicken!

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:02.188
You shouldn't
have called me that!

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.982
Ugh.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.442
You get it, you get it.
AII right now,

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:07.277
Jimmy Dean swings again.

01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:09.112
Whoo!

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:12.782
Hey. Now, come on.
Come on.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:16.077
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
He's pretty good, huh, Jazz?

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.412
Whoo hoo!

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.748
Oh!

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.212
I thought you'd seen the film, Cody.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:29.591
No sticking, just a little
jabbing, that's all!

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:33.803
Fuck!

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.680
Stop!

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.016
I don't want no trouble, okay?

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.684
Oh!

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:48.276
Oh.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:50.111
Shade, Megan.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:19.474
That's not how
the movie goes, Cody.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.560
Now that was a nice try,

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.188
but I'm getting a little
bored with all this.

01:06:25.272 --> 01:06:26.982
Maybe our little surprise

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:30.402
will help you remember
where Michelle is, huh?

01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:38.326
Hey.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:40.078
Come on Katmandu.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.830
The show ain't even over yet.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.167
You're fucking
with the wrong people!

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:51.381
No, you are. You have no
idea what's coming, Shade.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.094
Hm.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:58.596
Ah.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.266
PIease,

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:02.809
pIease, just Iet us go,

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.394
Michelle has nothing
to do with you.

01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:05.979
Untrue! We had an arrangement

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.689
with the oId man down the road

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:08.857
but he didn't honor
that arrangement.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:10.442
And your sister,

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.068
well your sister was just

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:16.114
at the wrong place
at the right time.

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.615
You're crazy.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.534
You're crazy!

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:21.870
Man! Crazy!

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:24.372
Women, more music,
and something upbeat.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.791
This pIace is becoming reaI square.

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:56.946
Ugh!

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:17.341
Please, God.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:21.429
Please, just let us...
Just let us go.

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.430
You think God
only listens to you?

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:27.519
So seIfish, Megan.
We got our gods too, you know,

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:31.022
just as real.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:35.359
And you know what, Iet me
Iet you inon something eIse.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:40.115
If there is a God,
guess what else exists.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.707
Leave her aIone.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:54.379
You don't scare us with
your stupid "Manson" shit.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:58.466
Shade. Sh.
They aren't who they say.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:03.220
What? Huh? I can hear
you, pretty girl.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.349
We're not... We're not what?

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:09.477
You don't know what we are?

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:14.314
No. No. You don't.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:18.236
We have been waiting
for a long time.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:22.240
Dormant for more than sixty years.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:26.661
And we are not trying to
scare anyone, Shade.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:31.374
It's just, what's coming,
[chuckIing and panting]

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:35.170
something is gonna happen
that can't be stopped!

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:40.216
And you get to witness the birth
firsthand. I'm so excited! Hm.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:43.094
Fuck you, you delusional dick, fuck!

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:47.265
Such ugly, ugly words
from a pretty, pretty girl.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:51.685
You are never gonna find a man with
a mouth Iike that, are you, Shade?

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.939
Or will ya? Speak of the devil! Whoo!

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.566
No!

01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:58.776
No! No! I'm gonna fucking kill you,

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:01.362
you fucking dick-head! No!

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.281
I'II kiII you, you fucking bastard!

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.700
Someone needs to shut her trap,
she is wearing on me!

01:10:05.784 --> 01:10:06.576
Fuck you!

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:11.206
Oh, thank you, Trixie.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:12.916
Who is this?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.460
Who could it be?

01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:20.965
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.636
Ain't so pretty anymore, is he?

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.894
We don't know
where she is, goddamn it!

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.270
Ugh.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:45.490
Yeah! Fuck hiMup,
Vernon! Whoo!

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.450
What?

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.827
What?

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.871
Stop! Stop the music ladies.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:54.040
What did you just say, Jazz?

01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:57.168
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it,
Vernon. I didn't mean to cuss, man.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.128
You're sorry?
Well, sorry ain't good enough, Jazz.

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:01.130
That's five in the swear jar,
now. Five! Now!

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:03.675
Five in the swear jar.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:10.974
We gotta take responsibilities
for our actions, don't we?

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.350
Yes, sir.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.935
Yes, we cannot be like them.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:14.769
No, sir.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:15.728
No.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.695
It's gonna be okay, Jazz.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:32.745
You couId put an end to aII this Cody,
aII you gotta do is teII us where she is.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.334
Get out of here!

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.169
Whoo!

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.797
Fuck you, I'm gonna kiII you!

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.133
Jazz, shut her down.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.892
Hey, Cody, you ever wonder
what's wrong with the worId?

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.978
You ever wonder
how to change it? Huh?

01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:59.314
You're fucking dead.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.914
Cody!

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.750
I Iove this cat!

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.338
Is it finally time, Vernon?

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.923
It is, Jazz. It is. Whoo hoo!

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.343
Murderball!

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.182
Where has my head been?

01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:38.186
I compIeteIy forgot,
we put her in the bathtub!

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.148
I am such a dummy.

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:43.483
Now I know
what you're thinking,

01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:45.234
Vernon, you're a fibber!

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.820
You knew this whoIe
time she was here.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:51.949
GuiIty as charged.
But we needed a safe pIace
for MicheIIe to incubate,

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:55.828
so we reaIIy did have
some time to kiII.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.626
Whoo hoo hoo whooo!

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.879
MicheIIe.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.550
What the fuck?

01:13:09.593 --> 01:13:11.636
This is how
the worId's gonna end, Cody.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.554
It's okay,

01:13:13.597 --> 01:13:15.598
she just doesn't
recognize her own yet.

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:17.725
What did you do to my sister?

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:20.228
Your sister, weII,

01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:23.731
she's not really your sister
anymore now, is she? No.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:27.652
You see, Michelle is the host,

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:30.738
to what you might
call our queen.

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:33.533
But that titIe doesn't
reaIIy give it justice,

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:37.745
now does it, Jazz? No.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.748
Line 'eMup in the front row.
I don't want anybody to miss this.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.584
I am so excited for you
to see this, especiaIIy you, Cody.

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:48.131
It is gonna to be soIid, goId, fantastic.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.043
Meg.

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.379
We gotta figure out

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.174
a way to get you out of here.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.009
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:35.636
Look at me,

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:37.722
I'm done.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.557
Hey!

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:42.518
Shut your mouth.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:49.108
You wouIdn't want me
to do something awfuI.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:52.236
Screw you.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.864
You just might.

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:56.824
Jazz, get over here.

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:59.035
Yeah.

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:01.996
Keep an eye on her, would ya?

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.671
Help us.

01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:16.010
I can teII, you're different
from everyone eIse.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:19.013
Just let us go.

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:38.866
Please, just let us go.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.561
She's something, ain't she?

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:08.980
AII right, boys.

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:12.942
Grab our friends and bring 'em
over here. It's time to bee-bop-a-loobop.

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:26.998
WeII, we want to thank you
aII for everything.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.585
It has been a wiId ride.

01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:33.796
Cody, Megan, Quentin,

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.966
ya'II sure do know how to
have a reaI sweII time.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:40.428
But, all good things
must come to an end.

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:42.263
Michelle.

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:45.266
Oh, you really don't
understand, do you? Huh?

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:48.144
You gotta let her go.
Michelle's gone, baby.

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:50.605
But something brilliant
is taking her place.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:54.567
You're not even human!
You're a devil! A monster!

01:16:54.651 --> 01:16:56.527
Do you even know
what is happening?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.155
Look around you
at what is happening.

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:03.159
Your stories of gods and
monsters and devils and angels and,

01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:05.870
where do you think
they come from? Huh? Huh?

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:10.166
They come from the void.
The bIackness, in-between the stars, Cody!

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:15.296
Out there where time
doesn't exist! From our kind.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:20.051
Oh, these fragile bodies

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.804
you decided to dwell in.

01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:28.142
These small moments

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:31.812
of emotion

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.649
so strange.

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:39.862
Oh. oh. This feeIing,

01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:43.032
is this love?

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:06.263
You're gonna have to deal with
some unpleasant shifts in time.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:11.352
But dig, you're gonna see
the beauty of the moment.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.624
This is for Shade.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.142
Murderball, finish him off.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.505
You're not gonna see
the grand finale?

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.927
You're gonna have to kill me
before I let you get to her.

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:54.765
All this
killing and violence,
so unnecessary,

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:58.519
but it seems to be the only
thing you people respond to.

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:03.274
I'm not gonna kill you,
Cody. I came to see you off.

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.359
You left without saying goodbye.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:08.404
We had a real good
time with ya, didn't we?

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.865
Lotta kicks, real fun.

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:16.453
But, now, I got some more
serious stuff I gotta take care of.

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:24.044
You see, I Iike you, I do.
In fact, I Iike you both,

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:28.048
which is why I'm gonna Iet you go.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:31.260
Trust me, I'm not
doing you a real favor.

01:21:31.344 --> 01:21:34.638
What's coming down
now is a far worse fate.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.308
Something you can't imagine.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:41.061
You see, your kind
is a dying breed.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.398
The human kind.

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:48.861
All right then.

01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:54.658
I almost forgot. You can go
ahead and take our wheels.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.328
We got no use for 'em anymore.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:01.790
Oh, pIus MurderbaII drank aII the
gasoIine in your pickup truck.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:06.420
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:19.600
It's gonna be a beautiful day!

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.243
Stay with me.

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:24.498
Don't fall a sleep. I'll get us some help.

01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:27.334
Stay awake.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.586
I'm awake.

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.509
Megan.

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.012
Thank you.

01:23:38.054 --> 01:23:40.305
For what?

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.226
A simple gesture.

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:47.521
You saw me different.

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:50.024
Thank you.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:57.156
I'll be right back. Okay?

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:41.408
Cody.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:44.078
It's gone dead!
