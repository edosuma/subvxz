Previously on Evermoor Chronicles.

00:02.080 --> 00:05.520
You must give us
three Fated villagers to inhabit.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.000
Where is the third?

00:07.160 --> 00:09.880
The lantern was repaired
with imbued thread.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.160
Those who aren’t Fated,
the lantern will hurt them.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.000
Stay away from the lantern!

00:16.440 --> 00:18.800
Kiss him and he'll be like he was before.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.320
Where's the tapestry?
In the beacon.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.920
The Founders are looking for you.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.480
# I left my friends for my new life

00:30.640 --> 00:33.680
# How will I know it's gonna be all right?

00:33.880 --> 00:40.440
#I got to take control
And write my destiny

00:40.560 --> 00:45.760
# The future's still untold
Nobody else can see

00:45.920 --> 00:52.600
# If this will be for Evermoor #

(CRACKLE)

01:00.000 --> 01:02.760
You’ll be safe from the Founders here.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.360
How? They've lamped everybody else
with a purple cloak.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.080
We both know I’m next.

01:08.280 --> 01:12.360
All we have to do is get that lantern,
then they won’t be able to harm you.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.600
What are you doing?

01:15.800 --> 01:18.960
Solving the problem.
The Founders won’t get me in London.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.440
What?
We escaped banishment and you’re leaving?

01:22.560 --> 01:26.360
Sure I’ll miss it here.
But what have I got in this place?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.000
Uh, your whole life?

01:28.120 --> 01:31.560
I'll start a new one.
Seen it on the Starting Over Channel.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.760
I’ll stay with Granny and you and Cam
can come whenever you want,

01:35.920 --> 01:37.840
with no-one in the way.
It’s insane!

01:38.000 --> 01:39.360
What’s insane?

01:41.520 --> 01:45.160
Bella wanted to give me
a kind of extreme style makeover.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.640
I was thinking Nautical--
Gothic.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.600
Gothic Nautical.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.320
Oh, that’s actually pretty good.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.480
Reminds me of the sleepovers
I used to have.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.000
Hey! Why don’t you girls
have a sleepover this evening?

02:00.160 --> 02:01.400
Have Sorsha round.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.160
Huh. I could give you both makeovers!

02:04.360 --> 02:05.360
(GASP)

02:06.840 --> 02:07.880
One night.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.640
Two intergalactic time travelers.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.520
Let the Nebula Battle-Lord
adventure begin!

02:16.680 --> 02:19.520
Or we could do my plan.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.520
Okay, what’s happening now?

02:21.680 --> 02:23.880
It’s my mom’s bogberry lipwand,

02:24.000 --> 02:29.320
and one of the many items
that will go into my "Casket of Eternity".

02:30.360 --> 02:32.560
You want to make a time capsule?

02:32.760 --> 02:34.400
"Casket of Eternity".

02:36.600 --> 02:38.080
We’ll leave a message.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.640
In 500 years, Evermoorians of the future
will discover it,

02:42.840 --> 02:44.760
hop in a time machine,
and visit us!

02:44.920 --> 02:48.080
So you’re like the tourist board,
for time travelers.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.080
Correct.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.000
"Welcome to the past.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.520
"It’s like the future, but slower!"

(DOOR KNOB CLICKS)

03:01.360 --> 03:04.040
Hello.
Hey.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.480
Did you learn anything about the lantern?

03:06.640 --> 03:10.440
It’s at the village hall.
Father will be watching over it tonight.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.640
But tomorrow Crimson takes over.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.880
Then that’s when we strike,
at the changeover!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.520
Nice work, Sorsha.
Whoop!

03:18.600 --> 03:20.840
Father disapproves of whooping.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.880
First things first. Sorsha, take a seat,
and prepare to be transformed.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.000
Not that one. It’s new.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.480
There’s no need to look frightened!

03:33.600 --> 03:36.840
We don’t want the boys to
have a better time than us.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.560
No. We’re going to have such a fun night,
we forget they even exist.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.200
(LAUGHING)
Whoa, this is amazing.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.200
You know you’re driving backwards right?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.520
(LAUGHING)

03:56.000 --> 03:57.320
You okay?

03:58.480 --> 04:01.120
It’s just quite an emotional bit.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.400
In "The Snoot Pellets Field Guide"?

04:04.520 --> 04:07.760
Look.
You know how Bella can sniff things out?

04:07.920 --> 04:13.120
The other day,
I’m pretty sure she could smell, that....

04:13.320 --> 04:18.400
That I... I don’t not like her.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.000
Oh, so you like her.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.760
Come on! Do something!

04:22.920 --> 04:25.400
What he said? Why don’t you tell her?

04:25.520 --> 04:31.840
Because I didn’t know I liked her.
Until I did. And there was Valentina.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.360
But you may not see her
for 1000 years.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.440
Even for a snoot,
that’s kind of a long wait for a date.

04:41.400 --> 04:46.400
Wow. It’s... futuristic.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.280
Retro! I knew you’d love it.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.480
Shall we do something else?

04:52.640 --> 04:55.400
I borrowed some of your golden thread.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.600
I thought we could make worry-no-mores!

05:00.800 --> 05:02.160
Worry no what now?

05:02.360 --> 05:03.480
Worry-no-mores!

05:03.600 --> 05:06.200
They’re dolls, made of golden thread.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.520
In the past, Everines sometimes made
terrible predictions about the future.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.440
To stop themselves worrying,
they made dolls.

(BIRD CHIRPING)

05:15.800 --> 05:17.400
Okay.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.320
You whisper your worries
to the dolls at night.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.000
And in the morning, the dolls are gone,
so are your worries.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.520
You go ahead with your "craft activity."

06:17.120 --> 06:21.600
They have the lantern. And the fated one.
Where is she?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.880
She must wear a purple cloak,
so must be in the circle.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.760
The circle were all weaklings.
Give me the list of names.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.000
They’re all crossed off. Except one.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.120
Bella Crossley.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.400
Bella still owns her purple cloak.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.000
I never barred her from the circle.

She’ll be fun to hunt.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.640

06:59.480 --> 07:06.480
I’m worried about the lantern.
And Bella. And the founders. And Tara.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.960
And Evermoor and everyone,

07:10.080 --> 07:14.320
and everything.

07:14.480 --> 07:20.440

take my fears, and disappear.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.200
I see my style magic rubbed off on you.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.920
Come on! My father’s in the village hall,
"keeping watch".

08:00.040 --> 08:04.280
Which means he’s asleep.
Which means we can take it. Coming?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.760
(FOOTSTEPS)

08:06.920 --> 08:10.200
But I thought we were
all going to go together.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.880
Bella, the founders are after you.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.040
We have to get that lantern
before the founders get it.

08:17.200 --> 08:22.400
But if you’re too scared to come with me,
perhaps the boys will have more guts.

Sorsha, what’s happened to you?
Why?

09:26.920 --> 09:29.960
Don’t like what you see?
No, you seem kind of--

Fearless? I made "worry-no-mores", Seb!

09:32.800 --> 09:34.560
And what worry did you tell?

09:34.720 --> 09:38.520
All of them. And it worked!
All my worries have gone.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.160
You’re only supposed to tell them one.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.080
Because if you all your worries

09:43.240 --> 09:46.120
you’d end up
a few groat-cheeses short of a picnic.

# Now, I’m not!

You made sure they were gone by morning?
Yeah! I’m like 73 percent sure.

If they were still there,
you have to cast them into water.

What’s with the cloak?
It’s a cunning decoy!

10:31.720 --> 10:34.080
If the Founders come,
I can lure them away.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.400
Shouldn’t you be asleep?
Sleep? Sleep is the worst.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.240

10:41.400 --> 10:43.920
and me, and everyone, all night.

So no more sleep.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.520
Yeah. For you maybe.

Now you’re awake, let’s play a game called
"emergency".

10:50.920 --> 10:54.520
All you have to do is read
the evacuation procedures.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.440
That sounds like a great game.
Exactly!

Wait, did Tara make worry dolls too?

11:22.840 --> 11:27.520
Do you care about the lantern or not?
I’m sure Tara’s fine.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.760
I’m just going to check she’s okay.
She’s fine! And I’m fine.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.240
More than fine, I’m on a mission.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.000
You’ll wake up your dad.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.240
Yes! That’s it. That’s what we do.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.800
We wake him up!
Otto, go wake him up.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.000
Say there’s a Code 90.
It means the Stumpy Plum has been burgled.

11:47.160 --> 11:51.880
Then you can sneak in, grab the lantern.
Simple.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.840
Is it? Because thinking about that plan
makes me want to fly away

11:56.000 --> 11:58.040
and take shelter in a nearby elm.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.680
Okay. Let’s stop and think about--

12:00.840 --> 12:03.160
Why, Sebastian?

12:03.320 --> 12:05.320
Have you lost your nerve?

12:05.520 --> 12:08.000

Otto texted me,
said it was an emergency.

Unless you both want to be bog-barreled,
you’d better tell me what’s going on now.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.320
It wasn’t them. It was me.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.920
Sorsha?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.560
What are you doing here?

13:57.720 --> 13:59.880
Only trying to save Evermoor!

14:00.000 --> 14:02.720
It’s the last time you stay
with the Crossley's.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.160
Father, it was me.

14:04.320 --> 14:09.160
Yes, you. You watching in horror
as Sebastian turned my store upside down.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.840
I did this.
Sorsha.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.960
I told you, I acted alone.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.800
So, Sebastian is behind this! I knew it.

14:18.960 --> 14:24.640
You’re not even listening to me!
There’s much I have to say. The Founders--

14:24.800 --> 14:29.360
She’s sleep talking!
Silence! I don’t want another word.

14:29.560 --> 14:34.040
Right now,
I have the lantern to take care of.

14:35.240 --> 14:39.560
Doors must be locked.
We’ve got to stop the Founders getting in.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.960
Doors locked.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.760
Windows shut. Doors locked.

14:49.240 --> 14:53.360
One sample of bogvine tea...

14:53.560 --> 14:55.600
and one string of worry-no-mores!

14:55.760 --> 14:57.960
Excellent.

14:58.960 --> 15:03.960
Now, for the ceremony of time.
We’ll bury the casket on the green.

15:04.080 --> 15:10.240
What about sleep?
The word’s sleepover. Sleep.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.080
Who’s there?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.920
Whoa!
Cameron! What are you doing here?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.240
I need to find the worry-no-mores.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.920
Are you in danger? I will protect you!

15:22.040 --> 15:23.400
Okay, just calm down.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.880
Oh, sure, let’s all be calm.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.080
That’s just what we need
when the forces of darkness are after us!

15:30.240 --> 15:33.320
They’ve gone!
The dolls are gone. Find The Dolls!

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Where are Jake and Ludo?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.760
They passed me with their casket.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.400
Jake, Ludo, the casket!
I’ll be back, okay?

15:43.600 --> 15:47.760
Jake? Ludo? Are you in there?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.520
Cameron?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.160
Stupid disguise!

16:00.400 --> 16:02.560
Disguise...

16:09.920 --> 16:12.880
(SPRAY SOUND THEN SNIFF)

16:16.320 --> 16:17.920
Tara?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.280
Tara?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.320
(SCREECH)

16:36.560 --> 16:38.760
"Dear Evermoorians of tomorrow.

16:38.920 --> 16:44.320
"Welcome to the past.
It’s like the future but slower. Visit us"

16:44.520 --> 16:47.280
Cameron! You’re okay.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.600
Hey, give me those dolls!
Please, they’re mine!

16:51.920 --> 16:53.640
(SPUTTER)
No!

16:56.600 --> 16:59.680
Wait, what just happened?

16:59.840 --> 17:02.680
Your sleepover got a little out of hand.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.200
Oh, no. Bella!

17:08.600 --> 17:10.920
I’m sick of being told what to do.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.000
Sorsha! This isn’t like you!
Isn’t it?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.200
(BOILING)

17:16.360 --> 17:18.160
Because I’m...

17:21.200 --> 17:23.680
so sorry.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.120
I’ll clear it up.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.960
Bella?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.160
Bella!

17:37.320 --> 17:38.320
Bella!

17:38.520 --> 17:43.000
Tara. You know,
you should really go back to bed.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.960
Tara? What is with you? Just talk to me!

17:49.800 --> 17:52.360
(INDISTINCTLY)
Bella?

18:06.840 --> 18:08.080
The lantern’s missing!

18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
Where’s Bella?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.600
It’s all my fault.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.120
The ancient magic, true love!

18:26.280 --> 18:28.880
It brought me back.
It can bring Bella back.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.680
Yeah, but you had Valentina.
Who does Bella love?

18:32.680 --> 18:35.240
(CAMERON) Tara! Where are you?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.960
No. No, he doesn’t feel the same way.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.120
Cameron can’t fall in love
with someone who isn’t here.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.440
What if she was?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.600
I’m a shapeshifter.
Do you know how I transform?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.280
I just close my eyes, and concentrate.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.960
And use this.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.120
I’ve never let anyone else use it before.
But I can’t see any other way.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.200
If you were Bella,
got Cameron to fall for her,

19:11.360 --> 19:14.720
perhaps he could bring her back.
You can’t be serious.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.040
You know Cameron better than anyone.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.040
I can't do this.

19:24.320 --> 19:28.840
(MAGICAL SOUND)

19:29.000 --> 19:31.760
Hey, have you seen Tara?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.440
Sweet Veronica...

19:37.920 --> 19:40.040
Next time on Evermoor Chronicles.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.560
It’s not a member of the Circle,
it’s the owner of a purple cloak.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.800
Sorsha Doyle owns a purple cloak.

19:46.960 --> 19:52.200
If you were to restate your vows,
you would be welcomed back in the Circle.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.760
If she doesn’t like you,
there's nothing we can do.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.160
It has to be Cameron.
You have to make him hate you.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.160
Why are you being mean?
I’m being honest with you. I have to be.

20:03.320 --> 20:07.640
Ever feel like we cross an invisible line?
Are you kidding me?
