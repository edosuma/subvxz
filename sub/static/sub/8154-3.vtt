00:32.064 --> 00:34.090
Honey, I'm home.

01:03.430 --> 01:07.833
Today, I, your eldest elder, am, uh...

01:07.901 --> 01:09.164
You're 72.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.534
Seventy-two years old.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.041
I've lived long
and witnessed many wonders.

01:15.108 --> 01:18.169
But now I am old.
I am slow.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.237
And I get up 16 times
in the middle of the night.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.682
I can no longer
keep up with the herd.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.947
I straggle behind,
attracting predators,

01:27.020 --> 01:30.615
endangering my brethren
and making us late for everything.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.750
Don't act like
you haven't noticed.

01:32.826 --> 01:37.491
Therefore, I wish to be hurled
from the highest cliff

01:37.564 --> 01:38.998
into a tar pit.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.660
- [clapping]
- [all] Ooh!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.597
- But before I go...
- Here it comes.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.572
...now decree that
from this day forward,

01:48.642 --> 01:50.201
all dinosaurs,

01:50.277 --> 01:53.975
upon reaching their, uh...

01:54.047 --> 01:56.379
Oh, 72nd birthday,

01:56.450 --> 02:00.080
shall be hurled into a tar pit,

02:00.153 --> 02:03.987
and this day
shall be known as...

02:04.057 --> 02:05.650
...Hurling Day.

02:05.726 --> 02:09.685
And so that this tradition
remains holy and solemn,

02:09.763 --> 02:14.564
each dinosaur shall be
hurled by a loving relative.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.194
Uh, excuse me.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.999
Yes, in the back.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.870
Uh, so this won't
be a total loss,

02:20.941 --> 02:24.844
could you make it that guys get
to hurl their mother-in-laws?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.280
Sure, why not?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.782
Hurling Day!
Hurling Day!

02:29.850 --> 02:33.013
[laughing] One more day
till Hurling Day!

02:33.086 --> 02:35.783
One more day
till 1 throw your mother

02:35.856 --> 02:39.793
over the cliff
and into the pit.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.989
Earl, it's supposed to be
a solemn and holy day.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.293
No. That's tomorrow.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.494
Today's a day of saying,
"Yipee, yipee!"

02:48.569 --> 02:50.970
After 20 years
of your mother on my back,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.029
I get to haul her to
the top of the mountain

02:53.106 --> 02:55.905
and fling her bony butt
to oblivion,

02:55.976 --> 02:58.172
solemnly and with dignity,
of course.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.077
[snickering]

03:00.147 --> 03:02.047
Earl, this is Mother's big day.

03:02.115 --> 03:05.676
Now, she's depending on you to throw
her in that nice section of the pit

03:05.752 --> 03:08.847
where there's shade,
next to her old friends, the Rosenfelds.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.947
Oh, yeah,
I'll do what I can,

03:11.024 --> 03:15.427
as long as she agrees
to sink quickly. [laughing]

03:15.495 --> 03:18.123
Hey, there's my little guy.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.599
Want to give Daddy a kiss?

03:20.667 --> 03:23.193
Not the mama,
not the mama, not the mama,

03:23.270 --> 03:25.534
not the mama,
not the mama!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.475
That is starting
to bother me.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.102
[laughing]

03:31.178 --> 03:33.146
Hey, guys,
Grandma's in the paper.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.681
Let me see.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.375
Give it here, Robbie.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.441
Ah...

03:38.519 --> 03:41.955
"Marriages, births, dismemberments,
large bites, hurlings."

03:42.022 --> 03:46.050
Here it is! "Ethyl Phillips, wife of...
blah, blah, blah,

03:46.126 --> 03:49.756
mother of... blah, blah, blah,
grandmother of... blah, blah, blah..."

03:49.830 --> 03:50.956
Oh! Listen!

03:51.031 --> 03:53.193
"...to be hurled into the ooze

03:53.267 --> 03:56.464
by her loving
son-in-law, Earl Sinclair."

03:56.537 --> 03:58.335
God, I love being a dinosaur!

03:58.405 --> 04:01.033
So, what do you think
it's like in the tar, anyway?

04:01.108 --> 04:03.338
In the tar?
You mean, actually in the tar?

04:03.410 --> 04:04.400
[Robbie] Yeah.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.412
Well... duh...

04:06.480 --> 04:10.314
I'd have to say that it's dark,
it's peaceful, it's quiet.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.783
No one really knows, son.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.116
But we'll all find out
when our time comes.

04:14.188 --> 04:17.851
- I gotta get to work. Thanks, honey.
- Bye, dear.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.485
Tell him to stop asking
such depressing questions.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.361
Your grandmother's been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.423
She's going to be reunited
with Grandpa Louie.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.869
I thought Grandpa
went on a cruise.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.428
You bought that?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.406
Robbie.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.808
Charlene, until now,
you've been too young to understand.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.473
But I think you're emotionally
mature enough now to know the truth.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.538
Oh.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.052
When dinosaurs turn 72,
they're thrown into a tar pit.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.712
Oh.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.348
Does this outfit
make me look fat?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.620
And I want you
to think of the tar pit

04:52.693 --> 04:54.593
as a wonderful place

04:54.661 --> 04:57.926
where you'll want
to spend eternity.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.798
Oh, I get it.
Just like the Galleria.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.771
Yeah.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.067
Hah.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.870
- [news theme on TV]
- Oh. [giggling]

05:08.942 --> 05:10.137
Hi, baby.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.770
Shh! Look!

05:12.846 --> 05:15.008
Well, I always felt
{ was was an herbivore

05:15.082 --> 05:18.052
trapped in
a carnivore's body.

05:18.118 --> 05:22.112
Cross-eaters, today at four on Raptile.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.682
- What's that all about?
- Eat.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.817
[humming]

05:28.896 --> 05:30.193
Hey there, pally boy,

05:30.264 --> 05:33.063
ready to give the mother-in-law
the old heave-ho?

05:33.133 --> 05:34.567
Roy, please.

05:34.635 --> 05:38.401
Fran's mother and I may have had
our differences for 20 years,

05:38.472 --> 05:41.237
but I take no joy
in what I do tomorrow.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.639
Huh?

05:44.578 --> 05:48.037
[both laughing]

05:48.115 --> 05:51.085
Hey, look at this.
Roy, Roy, look.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.382
- Take a look at these beauties.
- Oh, snatch me baldheaded.

05:54.454 --> 05:58.516
Genuine mother-in-law
pterodactyl-skin hurling gloves!

05:58.592 --> 06:01.220
Yeah, my father gave them
to me on my wedding day.

06:01.295 --> 06:04.424
- Look. Non-skid grip.
- Oh.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.763
These old babies have
thrown a lot of old ladies.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.236
- Yep.
- [male] Hey, Earl!

06:10.304 --> 06:14.207
Hey, tomorrow's
the big day, huh?

06:14.274 --> 06:15.537
Yeah.
How do you feel?

06:15.609 --> 06:18.169
I mean, any thoughts
in these final hours?

06:18.245 --> 06:21.647
Well, I just hope that when my turn
comes to go into the tar,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.412
those who knew me
will lift a glass and say,

06:24.484 --> 06:28.614
"Earl Sinclair,
no genius, no big shot,

06:28.689 --> 06:31.522
but did you see the loft
he got on his mother-in-law?"

06:31.592 --> 06:34.493
[all laughing]

06:34.561 --> 06:36.825
Hey, Earl, we just
want you to know

06:36.897 --> 06:39.923
tomorrow you're going
out there for all of us.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.764
Yeah, and remember,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.327
lift with your knees.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.872
Guys.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.338
Times like this,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.671
a guy feels
very close to his buddies.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.303
- We feel close to you.
- Yeah, we do.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.938
Sinclair, in here now!

06:54.014 --> 06:56.244
[all screaming]

06:58.051 --> 07:00.543
Aah! Oh!

07:01.955 --> 07:03.684
You sent for me,
my captain?

07:04.992 --> 07:09.020
Sinclair, I am a great
and powerful dinosaur,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.827
and you... well,
you're a puny nothing.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.196
Thank you, sir.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.134
Because of my position
and social standing,

07:16.203 --> 07:17.762
I can say
whatever I want to you,

07:17.838 --> 07:20.205
and you have
to flatter me in return!

07:20.274 --> 07:23.073
That's a keen and
brilliant observation, sir.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.169
But tradition gives us
one great equalizer:

07:26.246 --> 07:28.010
Hurling Day.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.778
One day, regardless
of our station in life,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.717
when the lowest
of the low

07:32.786 --> 07:34.515
can stand shoulder
to shoulder

07:34.588 --> 07:36.852
with the highest
of the high.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.655
- So drink, Sinclair?
- Wow!

07:39.726 --> 07:43.026
I'm overwhelmed by your
sudden lack of cruelty.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.326
Well, uh...

07:45.399 --> 07:47.231
...uh, here.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.099
- Nice gloves.
- Mmm.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.228
Thank you, sir.
They were given to me by...

07:51.305 --> 07:54.104
- I'm speaking.
- Yes, sir.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.664
It's been almost 30 years

07:55.742 --> 08:00.145
since I tossed
Mother Wilkerson into the goo.

08:00.214 --> 08:03.582
That look on her face as
she spiraled out of sight...

08:03.650 --> 08:05.277
Ahh.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.482
Ahh. Aah!

08:11.725 --> 08:15.423
My, it's sad
how the memories fade.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.225
Good thing I got it on VHS.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.822
- [chuckles]
- Ooh.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.391
[gasping]

08:21.468 --> 08:24.301
[female screaming]

08:24.371 --> 08:27.671
- Nice trajectory, sir.
- Damn right.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.210
The moment goes by
so quickly, my captain.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.042
Well, not on slo-mo.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.172
- Ha!
- [Earl laughing]

08:35.249 --> 08:37.479
[rewinding]

08:37.551 --> 08:39.883
[Richfield ] Whoop, there she goes.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.011
[Earl] Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

08:42.089 --> 08:44.183
[both laughing]

08:44.258 --> 08:48.092
Oh, this is...
this is so inspiring.

08:48.162 --> 08:51.257
It better be because
tomorrow's your day, Sinclair,

08:51.331 --> 08:53.129
and no one can
take it away from you,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.668
or I would've!

08:56.036 --> 08:58.368
But remember,
after tomorrow...

08:58.438 --> 09:00.099
Lowest of the low?

09:00.174 --> 09:02.370
For the rest of your life.

09:03.443 --> 09:06.310
So savor the moment,
Sinclair.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.439
It's the only one
you're ever going to get.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.914
[rumbling]

09:09.983 --> 09:11.417
Don't screw it up!

09:11.485 --> 09:13.180
Yes, sir... ho, sir.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.517
Uh... door.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.889
Aah!

09:22.963 --> 09:25.057
Yep, she's in the tar!

09:25.132 --> 09:27.032
Nice hang time, pally boy.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.499
I can do better.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.799
I've got to work
on my follow-through.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.398
Has anybody ever climbed
back out of the tar pit?

09:34.475 --> 09:36.273
No, son, once you're in,
you're in.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.209
Give me another mother-in-law.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.740
Yeah. Ready!

09:40.814 --> 09:42.407
Set, throw!

09:42.483 --> 09:44.008
[groans]

09:44.084 --> 09:45.574
[thud]

09:45.652 --> 09:47.882
Uh, Dad, when Grandma
goes into the tar pit,

09:47.955 --> 09:49.252
is there life after that?

09:49.323 --> 09:50.882
For me, there is.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.426
You're losing elevation.

09:52.493 --> 09:55.690
Robbie, you're breaking
my concentration.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.663
What do I say when she comes over
for this birthday dinner?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.793
Goodbye, good luck,
sorry you're being tossed off a cliff?

10:01.869 --> 10:04.531
[sighs] Let me explain this to you.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.438
She's lived her life.
She has laid her eggs.

10:07.508 --> 10:09.636
It is time for her to move on.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.974
Now, you want dinner conversation,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.514
ask her to tell you
about how useless she is.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.915
- [doorbell]
- [Fran] Earl, Mother's here.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.886
Not for long.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.753
- [laughing] Yeah
- Oh! .

10:26.426 --> 10:29.054
Mother, you look terrific.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.827
Thank you, sweetheart.
I had my scales done for the occasion.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.890
Yeah, yeah.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.595
Mom, tomorrow's the big day.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.195
Yeah, the biggest.

10:38.272 --> 10:40.639
I'm so excited,
I feel like a schoolgirl.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.301
Charlene, sweetheart,
pour me a Scotch, will you?

10:43.377 --> 10:45.539
OK. ♪ La la la la la

10:45.612 --> 10:47.740
- There's a good girl.
- [Robbie] Hi, Gram.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.307
There he is,
Robbie, my baby.

10:50.384 --> 10:53.081
Come here, let your grandma
give you five kisses.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.121
[smooching]

10:56.457 --> 10:58.516
You must be beating
girls off with a stick.

10:58.592 --> 10:59.753
Oh, well...

10:59.827 --> 11:01.693
Here's $5.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.231
Aw, thanks, Grandma.

11:04.298 --> 11:06.392
Come on, Mom,
you're gonna spoil him.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.865
Indulge me, Fran.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.562
What am I saving it for?

11:09.636 --> 11:12.230
Grandma, what's this
worth to you?

11:12.306 --> 11:15.936
Oh, wow, $100.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.943
- And five kisses.
- Oh!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.604
That's for college.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.148
I'm not going to college

11:21.215 --> 11:23.115
unless I have
something to wear!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.277
[gasps]

11:25.352 --> 11:26.979
It's the baby.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.217
It's the grandma!
Uh-oh.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.520
Hello, Mother Phillips.

11:32.593 --> 11:34.425
Hello, fat boy.

11:34.495 --> 11:36.224
Hello, you vicious old...

11:36.296 --> 11:37.821
Earl Snead Sinclair!

11:37.898 --> 11:39.559
Oh, God.
My whole name.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.761
I'm asking for peace
for one night.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.269
- But she...
- One night.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.863
Twelve hours, and she's
out of your life forever.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.909
- But, Frannie...
- Don't respond to her.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.570
I do not want you
to open your mouth.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.135
She provokes me!

11:53.213 --> 11:55.545
Close your mouth
and don't let her provoke you.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.414
- I am the mighty mega...
- Close it!

11:57.484 --> 11:58.679
[grumbling]

11:58.752 --> 12:00.584
Hello, fat boy.

12:00.654 --> 12:01.951
[laughing]

12:02.022 --> 12:03.353
You see that?

12:03.423 --> 12:06.393
Oh, Mother.
Come here, sweetheart.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.895
Up we go, there.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.496
You and I have had
a lot of tough times, Earl.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.434
I just want to say I'm sorry.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.100
Jeez, Ethyl, you mean it,
you're sorry?

12:20.174 --> 12:23.200
Yeah, I'm sorry
you married my daughter,

12:23.277 --> 12:25.837
and I'm sorry she has to live
in a cold, drafty hole

12:25.913 --> 12:27.438
on the wrong side of the swamp

12:27.514 --> 12:29.846
with a guy who was a tree
pusher 20 years ago,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.784
and today is, surprise,
still a tree pusher.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.914
- Frannie!
- Mother.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.482
- I said I'm sorry.
- Let's go, old lady.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.995
We're going over
the cliff right now!

12:42.062 --> 12:44.531
Dinner? Would anyone
like dinner?

12:44.598 --> 12:47.295
Only if it's fattening.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.132
Eat all you want.
You'll be worth the hernia.

12:55.409 --> 12:57.036
And I want you
to have this.

12:57.111 --> 12:59.603
It's a seashell necklace
your grandfather gave me

12:59.680 --> 13:01.808
on our tenth anniversary.

13:01.882 --> 13:05.546
Wow! Hey, there's a bite
taken out of it here.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.179
It was a wild night.
Don't ask.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.781
Thanks for the great stuff, Grandma.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.385
You know, you've lived
such a fascinating life.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.452
Well, I'm bored
out of my mind.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.589
I'll see you tomorrow, Ethyl.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.133
[laughing]

13:20.200 --> 13:21.634
It is getting late.

13:21.702 --> 13:23.363
We should go to sleep.

13:23.437 --> 13:25.769
- [Fran] Good night.
- [Charlene] Good night.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.068
[smooching]

13:27.140 --> 13:29.131
[Fran] Is there anything
I can get you?

13:29.209 --> 13:32.042
Yeah, get a divorce
and marry someone else.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.807
There's still 12 hours left.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.043
Good night, Mother.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.949
Mary Ellen Sworkinson's
daughter married a podiatrist

13:39.019 --> 13:40.851
four hours before she got hurled.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.357
She went into the tar
a happy dinosaur,

13:44.425 --> 13:46.257
hurled by a professional.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.355
Oh.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.919
Hmm.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.527
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Not tired?

13:56.603 --> 13:59.903
Aren't you worried about what's
gonna happen to you tomorrow?

13:59.973 --> 14:01.668
I'm looking forward to it.

14:01.742 --> 14:03.301
I miss my Louie.

14:03.377 --> 14:05.505
You don't remember
your grandpa, do you?

14:05.579 --> 14:07.980
You were very young
when he was hurled.

14:09.183 --> 14:10.446
Aw. See that?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.713
That's you on your
Grandpa Louie's back,

14:12.786 --> 14:14.686
hitting him on the head with a pot.

14:14.755 --> 14:16.814
Wow.
Is this me and you?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.450
Yeah. Look, I had all my spikes.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.654
This is when you
visited me at camp.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.026
Your Grandpa Louie
was such a fisherman.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.929
He could stick his head
in the water,

14:25.999 --> 14:28.798
come up with tuna fish,
grouper, you name it.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.894
Oh. A letter I wrote you.

14:30.971 --> 14:35.431
[clears throat] It says, "Dear Grandma,
how are you? I am good.

14:35.509 --> 14:38.103
It is good here at camp.
The food is good.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.772
I hope you're good too.

14:40.848 --> 14:42.646
Love, Robbie Sinclair."

14:42.716 --> 14:46.118
Yeah, yeah,
you always wrote me.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.520
Grandma, I don't want
you to go in the tar tomorrow.

14:49.590 --> 14:52.082
Hey, I've lived a long life.
I've earned this.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.992
But I don't want you to go.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.588
You're a young,
sweet kid, Robbie,

14:57.664 --> 15:00.759
and you don't really
know anything yet.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.226
I know. I know, you're right.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.297
Hurling's been around a million years,
and I've been around 14 years.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.809
So I can hardly believe
I'm gonna do this.

15:09.877 --> 15:11.936
- Let's go.
- What are you gonna do?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.208
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.375
[groaning]

15:25.759 --> 15:28.285
[Earl] Rise and shine, Ethyl.
Rise and shine!

15:28.362 --> 15:31.388
Today's the last day
of the rest of your life.

15:31.465 --> 15:36.869
I'm wearing my brand-new
silk Hurling Day tie.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.371
Ethyl?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.928
Ethyl?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.497
Ethyl?

15:41.575 --> 15:43.475
Ethyl!

15:43.544 --> 15:44.978
Fran!

15:45.045 --> 15:47.742
Robert, stop this.
It's dangerous out this early.

15:47.815 --> 15:49.408
Everything's hungry.

15:49.483 --> 15:52.248
No, I'm not letting them
throw you in the tar pit.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.788
- There's just no reason for it.
- There is, dear.

15:54.855 --> 15:59.759
It's a time-honored tradition started by
a wise old dinosaur named Bob La Brea.

15:59.827 --> 16:02.353
- [snapping]
- What's that?

16:02.429 --> 16:05.023
- Hide yourself.
- Uh...uh...

16:05.098 --> 16:08.090
- Robbie, don't be a stupid kid!
- Come on, Grandma.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.000
Forget about me.
Hide yourself.

16:12.673 --> 16:16.132
Forget about me.
Hide yourself.

16:16.210 --> 16:18.736
[growling]

16:26.086 --> 16:28.111
...I just couldn't
leave you, Grandma.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.020
I couldn't do it.

16:30.090 --> 16:34.049
Now do you see
why old dinosaurs go into the tar?

16:37.865 --> 16:40.027
Take me home, dear.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.268
Please let the old lady
be all right.

16:45.339 --> 16:50.038
Please, please,
don't take this away from me!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.442
[Earl] Where have you been?

16:52.513 --> 16:56.211
Don't get in an uproar, chuckles.
We were just out for a little walk.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.377
I know where you went.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.942
You do?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.614
You went to throw yourself
over the cliff without me,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.817
but Robbie found you
and brought you back.

17:04.892 --> 17:07.292
Good boy.
She may try again.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.851
Keep an eye on her.

17:08.929 --> 17:11.261
- No problem.
- Ethyl.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.388
[chuckling]

17:12.465 --> 17:14.263
Now, listen, Ugh,

17:14.334 --> 17:17.065
I'm expecting an important
package this afternoon.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.071
So whatever you do,
don't open it.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.871
I won't, Woodrow.

17:24.444 --> 17:29.541
[narrator] Hilarious high jinks
with that talking caveman on Mr. Ugh.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.948
<i>3 lam Mr. Ugh</i>

17:32.019 --> 17:33.953
[narrator] Today at four.

17:35.089 --> 17:37.524
Uh... Mom, could I talk
to you for a second?

17:37.591 --> 17:38.615
Yes, dear.

17:38.692 --> 17:40.319
Uh... what would
be the big deal

17:40.394 --> 17:42.385
if nobody threw Grandma
into the tar pit?

17:42.463 --> 17:44.488
It would kill
your father, dear.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.535
Mom, it used to be that
old dinosaurs slowed down the pack.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.035
Now we live in houses.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.230
It used to be old
dinosaurs couldn't hunt.

17:51.305 --> 17:52.670
Now we have supermarkets.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.003
Isn't throwing Grandma
off a cliff just a waste

17:55.075 --> 17:56.600
of a perfectly good old lady?

17:58.946 --> 18:00.345
I'm just asking.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.404
What?

18:01.482 --> 18:03.041
Since we're domesticated now,

18:03.117 --> 18:06.052
there's nothing forcing us
to hurl Mother, is there?

18:06.120 --> 18:10.023
[laughing] That's an interesting
notion there, Fran.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.114
Isn't it?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.955
I just can't help wondering

18:13.026 --> 18:15.791
where you came up with
this interesting notion.

18:15.863 --> 18:18.730
Well, I have to admit
it's not actually my idea,

18:18.799 --> 18:21.427
although the moment I heard it,
it made so much sense.

18:21.502 --> 18:23.470
Doesn't it make sense to you?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.665
Oh, yeah,
it certainly does.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.606
But you know what
I'm curious about?

18:28.675 --> 18:32.669
Where did this idea
come from originally?

18:32.746 --> 18:36.239
If you think about it,
it's a barbaric ritual.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.750
It's not barbaric!

18:37.818 --> 18:39.786
It's holy and solemn.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.947
Earl, you're overreacting.

18:42.022 --> 18:44.423
Fran, dear, I'm merely
stating my position.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.959
There is no position.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.721
Earl, I've made my decision.

18:47.795 --> 18:49.490
You're not throwing Mother.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.395
- I'm throwing her!
- Ow.

18:51.465 --> 18:54.491
You want to sleep on the couch
for the rest of your life?

18:54.568 --> 18:57.094
I'm throwing her, Fran.
Ethyl!

18:57.171 --> 18:59.333
I'm throwing her.
I'm throwing her.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.272
I married you
so I could throw her.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.139
So is the hat too much?

19:03.210 --> 19:05.679
Change of schedule.
We're taking off early.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.111
Earl!

19:07.181 --> 19:09.013
Uh... look, it's Godzilla!

19:09.082 --> 19:10.743
Huh, what?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.648
[groaning] You had
to eat a big breakfast.

19:18.726 --> 19:21.252
Just push the chair, fat boy.

19:22.196 --> 19:23.664
Come on. Come on.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.756
Slow down. I want to fix
my face for my Louie.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.735
- You look gorgeous, Ethyl.
- Oh, do you think so?

19:29.803 --> 19:33.103
- Yeah. Get your foot off the brake.
- Oh, shut up.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.575
[groans]

19:36.643 --> 19:38.702
[Ethyl] Push, push!

19:38.779 --> 19:41.942
OK, Ethyl,
I wrote this speech...

19:42.015 --> 19:43.949
Uh... you can read it
on the way down.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.009
- Earl, stop!
- OK, I'm ready.

19:47.087 --> 19:49.419
No, you're not, Grandma.
You don't have to go.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.254
- What?
- Dad, a million years ago,

19:51.325 --> 19:55.353
some old dinosaur did what was right in
his time and created this hurling thing.

19:55.429 --> 19:58.490
You can do what's right in your time
and go down in history.

19:58.565 --> 20:02.058
You could be a legend
among dinosaurs!

20:02.136 --> 20:05.731
Or have momentary satisfaction
of throwing grandma off the cliff.

20:07.608 --> 20:10.600
You should think about
this long and hard.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.541
Watch your toes, son.

20:16.617 --> 20:19.086
- Listen, Dad!
- No, you listen!

20:19.153 --> 20:20.518
This is my moment.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.783
This is the time when
the lowest of the low

20:22.856 --> 20:25.348
can stand with
the highest of the high.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.417
If I lose this,
my life means nothing.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.726
Well, then I guess
my life means nothing, Dad.

20:31.799 --> 20:34.928
- What are you saying?
- When the time comes,

20:35.002 --> 20:37.471
- I'm not throwing you.
- Why the hell not?

20:37.538 --> 20:40.098
Because you're my father
and just because you get old

20:40.174 --> 20:43.542
doesn't mean you're not
my father anymore.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.873
Oh, jeez!

20:44.945 --> 20:46.777
Hello?
Hello?

20:46.847 --> 20:48.508
Am I suddenly invisible?

20:48.582 --> 20:51.517
Why doesn't somebody
ask me how I feel?

20:51.585 --> 20:54.020
How do you feel, Mother?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.816
I'm an old dinosaur.

20:55.889 --> 20:58.381
There's no safe place
for me anymore in this world.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.727
You could live with us
in Dad's den!

21:01.795 --> 21:04.457
That's it!
They're both going over.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.329
Times are changing, Earl.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.494
Today? Do they have
to change today?

21:08.569 --> 21:10.196
She's just an old dinosaur.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.863
She's just gonna be in the way.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.203
She's only old because
she's lived a long time.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.503
[Earl gasps]

21:15.576 --> 21:17.840
Maybe there are things
we can learn from her.

21:17.911 --> 21:20.243
Maybe how we treat our old
dinosaurs is wrong.

21:20.314 --> 21:23.443
Maybe it's better to keep
them than throw them away.

21:23.517 --> 21:26.976
Grandma, just tell him
you don't want to go.

21:27.054 --> 21:28.886
Robbie, darling,

21:28.956 --> 21:32.153
I've done everything there
is to do in this life.

21:32.226 --> 21:34.820
At my age, what do
I have to live for?

21:34.895 --> 21:38.195
Fran, I am not letting
your mother move into my house

21:38.265 --> 21:41.064
to spend her days
making my life miserable.

21:44.438 --> 21:45.735
Take me home, dear.

21:45.806 --> 21:49.640
Yes! Cool!
Excellent!

21:49.710 --> 21:50.905
I'm coming, Louie.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.173
Earl, stop.

21:52.246 --> 21:54.010
Fran, if you love me,
throw me in.

21:54.081 --> 21:56.209
Earl, it's just
for the rest of her life.

21:56.283 --> 21:58.081
How long can that possibly be?

21:58.152 --> 21:59.551
How should I know, Fran?

21:59.620 --> 22:03.113
Nobody ever died
of getting old before.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.452
You know...

22:08.529 --> 22:12.727
I feel like I could
live to be a million!

22:13.700 --> 22:15.361
Jeez!

22:15.436 --> 22:17.234
[groans]

22:29.016 --> 22:30.745
[Earl] Hey, it was a mighty toss.

22:30.818 --> 22:33.583
I mean, I almost threw her
past the tar pit entirely.

22:33.654 --> 22:37.147
And then-then-then
she came down and down,

22:37.224 --> 22:40.194
and then, uh...

22:40.260 --> 22:41.785
She bounced!

22:41.862 --> 22:44.991
Yeah, she bounced right back up
and landed back in her chair.

22:45.065 --> 22:46.624
It's a miracle, they tell me.

22:46.700 --> 22:50.364
So I gotta let her move in.
That's the truth.

22:51.672 --> 22:54.039
Earl, you killed us.

22:54.108 --> 22:56.975
[groans]

22:57.305 --> 23:03.534
