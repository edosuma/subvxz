WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:05.575
Oh, hey, we ran into your
mom at Benihana last night.

00:05.577 --> 00:07.276
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

00:07.278 --> 00:09.178
Every time they flip
a shrimp in the air,

00:09.180 --> 00:11.814
she practically leaps out
of her seat to catch it.

00:12.784 --> 00:15.084
That's why I don't take her
to SeaWorld.

00:16.321 --> 00:17.620
I know you-you don't
want to hear it,

00:17.622 --> 00:18.921
but she was there with Stuart.

00:18.923 --> 00:20.089
That's fine.

00:20.091 --> 00:21.324
I don't care.

00:21.326 --> 00:23.426
It doesn't bug you when
they go out on dates?

00:23.428 --> 00:24.694
They're not dating.

00:24.696 --> 00:27.530
They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

00:27.532 --> 00:29.499
And then went back
to the home they share

00:29.501 --> 00:30.566
where they probably fell asleep

00:30.568 --> 00:32.134
in the matching pajamas
she got them

00:32.137 --> 00:35.071
because they both
just love penguins.

00:36.307 --> 00:39.041
Hey, lots of people
wear matching pajamas

00:39.043 --> 00:40.009
who aren't dating.

00:40.011 --> 00:43.079
Like who?
Like you and your dog.

00:44.649 --> 00:47.283
Don't rule out the dating.

00:47.285 --> 00:49.919
Fine, it bothers me.

00:49.921 --> 00:51.788
You happy?

00:51.790 --> 00:53.389
You think you've got problems.

00:53.391 --> 00:57.326
The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified

00:57.328 --> 01:00.129
as a great ape.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.031
How is this helpful?

01:02.033 --> 01:04.566
All the non-human apes
are classified

01:04.569 --> 01:06.202
as great apes except one.

01:06.204 --> 01:09.438
That means taxonomists created
the entire category

01:09.440 --> 01:12.441
of lesser ape just
to single out the poor gibbon

01:12.443 --> 01:15.144
as the weird kid
on the playground.

01:15.146 --> 01:19.315
Now there's a hairy little
fellow with a genuine beef.

01:19.317 --> 01:22.285
But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

01:22.287 --> 01:23.920
It doesn't even know
it's called a gibbon.

01:23.922 --> 01:25.888
True.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.491
Sorry, kid, you've got it
worse than a gibbon.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.920
(knocking on door)
Hi.

02:00.922 --> 02:01.854
Hey.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.122
We brought snacks
for movie night.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.423
Oh, great.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.359
I don't suppose you also brought
napkins, clean bowls,

02:06.361 --> 02:08.227
utensils and a roll
of toilet paper.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.229
Right here.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.263
Ah!

02:11.265 --> 02:12.665
You guys are the best.

02:12.667 --> 02:13.733
What's with the clothes?

02:13.735 --> 02:15.701
Well, with all the new stuff
I bought for work,

02:15.703 --> 02:17.370
I needed to make room
in my closet.

02:17.372 --> 02:18.971
I meant why are they folded?

02:18.973 --> 02:21.240
But whatever.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.776
Ooh, what's this?

02:23.778 --> 02:26.679
That, believe it or not,
is my prom dress.

02:26.681 --> 02:28.981
Wow, you still have it?

02:28.983 --> 02:30.483
I just assumed
it was balled up

02:30.485 --> 02:34.086
in the corner
of a barn somewhere.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.657
What kind of teenager
did you think I was?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.760
Slutty.
Easy.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.964
The word is "popular."

02:45.967 --> 02:47.967
How was your prom?
Did you go?

02:47.969 --> 02:49.502
No, but I was
on clean-up crew.

02:49.504 --> 02:51.170
Aw, that's sad.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.805
No, it was okay.

02:52.807 --> 02:55.341
The DJ let me dance
one slow song with my mop

02:55.343 --> 02:57.743
before he shut down.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.046
Whenever I see
a bucket of dirty water,

03:00.048 --> 03:03.749
I still hear "Lady in Red."

03:05.386 --> 03:07.653
My prom was pretty
terrible, too.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.954
I was so excited
about my date,

03:08.956 --> 03:10.723
but it turned out
he only asked me

03:10.725 --> 03:11.791
'cause he liked my friend.

03:11.793 --> 03:13.859
He spent the whole night
talking about her.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.262
Okay, we get it, you had
a friend <i> and</i> a date.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.064
Stop bragging.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.632
Doesn't matter.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.699
Prom is silly anyways.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.368
Easy for you to say;
you probably went

03:22.370 --> 03:23.803
with the captain
of the football team.

03:23.805 --> 03:25.938
(scoffs)
No.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.606
I just made out
with him a little

03:27.608 --> 03:29.475
while his date was puking.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.812
My date would've had
to clean that up.

03:34.182 --> 03:35.614
Ooh, I have an idea.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.651
Maybe we can have,
like, a prom do-over.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.586
Oh, that would be so much fun.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.456
We could decorate the roof
and make the guys wear tuxedos.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.357
Ooh, and get our hair done,
and slow-dance.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.625
Okay, guys, trust me,

03:46.627 --> 03:48.427
as someone who's been to,
like, seven proms,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.896
it is never as good
as you want it to be.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.599
You went to seven proms?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.800
Yeah, let's see.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.536
Uh, four "Under the Seas,"
two "Enchanted Evenings,"

03:57.538 --> 03:58.771
and one "Night to Remember"

03:58.773 --> 04:02.007
that... I cannot remember
for the life of me.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.711
Hey.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.413
Hey.
Hey, where's Bernadette?

04:07.415 --> 04:10.049
She and Amy are out dress
shopping for their prom thing.

04:10.051 --> 04:11.884
Oh, yeah,
I got that Evite.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.619
Ever since I saw <i> Pretty in Pink,</i>

04:13.621 --> 04:15.654
I've wanted to go
to an American prom.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.324
But then I saw <i> Carrie,</i>

04:18.326 --> 04:21.060
and I did not want to go
to an American prom.

04:21.062 --> 04:22.361
But then I saw
<i>Never Been Kissed,</i>

04:22.363 --> 04:23.929
and I'm back
on the prom bandwagon.

04:25.233 --> 04:28.234
This prom thing's been
a real roller coaster.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.836
Bernie's really excited.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.072
I-I could tell because
her voice got so high,

04:33.074 --> 04:35.708
the beagle next door
started howling.

04:37.512 --> 04:38.711
Did you go to your prom?

04:38.713 --> 04:40.613
No.
(chuckles)

04:40.615 --> 04:43.182
I had a date
with a proper education.

04:44.719 --> 04:48.621
Instead of a tuxedo,
I dressed myself in good habits.

04:48.623 --> 04:49.755
Instead of spiked punch,

04:49.757 --> 04:52.291
I enjoyed the intoxicating
flavor of knowledge.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.827
Instead of
dancing in a gym,

04:54.829 --> 04:57.396
I shook my booty
to the seductive rhythms...

04:57.398 --> 04:59.064
Okay, okay.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.799
...of AP Calculus.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.838
How come you're not shopping
with Amy and Bernadette?

05:05.840 --> 05:08.641
Let me guess, you think
the whole idea is lame?

05:08.643 --> 05:10.142
Well, who cares what I think?
What do you think?

05:10.144 --> 05:12.144
Hmm, to be honest,

05:12.146 --> 05:15.214
it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom

05:15.216 --> 05:16.815
with a woman
as beautiful as you.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.485
Ugh, thanks a lot.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.287
What?

05:21.289 --> 05:25.424
Well, now I can't blow this
thing off without being a bitch.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.826
That sounds like a "yes"!

05:30.698 --> 05:34.066
Ooh, every single person
RSVP'd "yes."

05:34.068 --> 05:35.834
This is so exciting!

05:35.836 --> 05:38.170
(higher pitched):
Isn't this exciting?

05:38.172 --> 05:39.939
(dog howls)

05:41.275 --> 05:42.675
Yep.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.177
Look, even Stuart's
bringing a date.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.245
I wonder who it is.

05:46.247 --> 05:48.180
You know exactly
who it is.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.515
He's gonna bring my mom.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.050
Why did you even invite him?

05:51.052 --> 05:53.786
Because he's our friend,
and you two need to get along.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.221
And why can't
he take your mom?

05:55.223 --> 05:57.990
You took her
to your prom.

05:57.992 --> 06:01.894
I didn't "take" her;
she was a chaperone.

06:01.896 --> 06:05.030
I saw a picture of you two
dancing together.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.165
W-What was I gonna do?

06:06.167 --> 06:07.666
They were playing our song!

06:09.370 --> 06:11.670
I can't take
this anymore.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.374
(phone rings)

06:15.376 --> 06:16.342
Hello.

06:16.344 --> 06:17.610
WOLOWITZ:
Stuart, we have to talk.

06:17.612 --> 06:22.314
This thing with you and my mom,
I-I hate it.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.049
It's making me crazy.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.585
You and I were
friends for years,

06:26.587 --> 06:30.089
and now you're bringing my
mother to a party I'm going to?!

06:30.091 --> 06:31.557
What the hell?!

06:31.559 --> 06:34.126
I'm not bringing your mother,
I have a date.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.662
Oh, so now you're cheating
on my mother?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.968
Wha-What are you talking about?

06:42.970 --> 06:45.971
There's nothing weird going on
with me and your mother.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.841
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Stewie,
your bath is getting cold!

06:50.011 --> 06:52.211
I got to go, bye.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.615
(knocking on door)
SHELDON: Penny?

06:56.617 --> 06:57.850
(knocks)
Penny.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.084
(knocks)
Penny.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.452
(knocks)
Penny.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.187
(knocks)
Penny.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.523
You knocked more than usual.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.724
Next time I might be in a rush,

07:05.726 --> 07:07.293
it's good to have
a few in the bank.

07:07.295 --> 07:09.094
Okay, what's up?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.463
I'd like to discuss this party

07:11.465 --> 07:12.998
that Amy and Bernadette
are throwing.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.168
Since you and I are both
reluctant to go,

07:16.170 --> 07:19.738
I think I've come up with a
perfect way for us to enjoy it.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.140
Great, how?

07:21.142 --> 07:23.275
We pretend we're aliens.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.147
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

07:28.149 --> 07:31.016
but I'm gonna say that you love
it and want to hear more.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.586
Now,
in the beloved novel

07:34.588 --> 07:36.488
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

07:36.490 --> 07:39.992
an alien named Ford Prefect
pretended to be human

07:39.994 --> 07:43.228
in order to blend in so that he
could write an entry about Earth

07:43.230 --> 07:45.397
for <i> The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

07:45.399 --> 07:48.000
which is a travel book
within the actual book,

07:48.002 --> 07:49.201
which is also called

07:49.203 --> 07:52.004
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

07:52.006 --> 07:54.840
Okay, just one question.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.108
What?

07:57.511 --> 08:00.312
My point is,
pretending to be an alien is

08:00.314 --> 08:02.681
a valuable coping mechanism
I've used many times.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.818
I did it the first time
I went to see you in a play.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.988
You had no idea
Commander Umfrumf

08:09.990 --> 08:12.224
of Ceti Alpha Three
was in the audience.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.128
Oh, d-don't worry,
he gave you seven thumbs up.

08:17.098 --> 08:18.931
Here's a question--

08:18.933 --> 08:22.134
as an alien pretending to be
human, are you planning

08:22.136 --> 08:26.939
to engage in any post-prom
mating rituals with Amy?

08:30.077 --> 08:33.812
There are post-prom
mating rituals?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.114
Not always.

08:35.116 --> 08:37.282
Unless your date drives
a van with an air mattress,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.150
then always.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.188
Well, if it's part of the prom
experience, then I'm open to it.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.925
You're kidding.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.862
I may be an alien,
but I have urges.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.900
If Amy wants to copulate
by firing her eggs into space,

08:54.902 --> 08:56.635
well, then,
I will happily catch them

08:56.637 --> 08:59.805
with the reproductive sac
on my upper flermin.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.311
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

09:06.313 --> 09:09.114
but I can see that
you're a little turned on.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.887
You know, if you're not
gonna learn how to do this,

09:14.889 --> 09:16.555
they make some
pretty good clip-ons.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.958
Bruce Wayne doesn't
wear a clip-on.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.329
Bruce Wayne doesn't make
his roommate tie it for him.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.199
His name is Alfred,
and, yes, he does.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.670
There, perfect.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.938
What, are you sure?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.574
It's my first prom,
I want to do it correctly.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.810
I thought you were gonna
pretend to be an alien.

09:37.812 --> 09:40.279
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

09:40.281 --> 09:41.780
You didn't want to.

09:41.782 --> 09:45.684
Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali
and Wolowitz didn't want to.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.954
And even I knew it was weird
to hire somebody.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.594
Was that a flask?

09:55.596 --> 09:56.995
Yes.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.031
I've decided to embrace
all of the traditions

09:59.033 --> 10:01.934
associated with prom,
including spiking the punch.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.371
You're gonna put alcohol
in the punch?

10:06.373 --> 10:09.074
Oh, no, this is
pomegranate juice.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.510
It's all the fun
of high school high jinks

10:11.512 --> 10:14.780
with the cell-protecting zip
of antioxidants.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.417
If you had ripped jeans
and a leather jacket,

10:18.419 --> 10:21.253
you'd be like the toughest kid
on the Disney Channel.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.991
So, anything else
planned for tonight?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.659
Oh, everything.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.395
Getting our picture taken,
slow-dancing,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.731
being elected prom king.

10:34.335 --> 10:36.802
Pointing out that
kings aren't elected.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.707
It's gonna be off the hook.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.276
And while you're at it,

10:44.278 --> 10:46.645
I know that at this age
your hormones are raging,

10:46.647 --> 10:48.614
but just because all
your friends are having sex

10:48.616 --> 10:49.915
doesn't mean you have to.

10:52.253 --> 10:53.785
Why would you say that?

10:53.787 --> 10:56.088
You know, 'cause...

10:56.090 --> 10:58.390
'cause a lot of people lose
their virginity on prom night.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.392
Penny implied the same thing.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.527
Is this true?

11:01.529 --> 11:03.462
Just relax, it's a joke.

11:03.464 --> 11:06.298
You don't have
hormones.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.074

11:19.786 --> 11:21.734
Wow, you look amazing.

11:21.870 --> 11:24.437
Thank you, so do you.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.701
Sheldon,
you look so handsome.

11:26.703 --> 11:28.970
Thank you.

11:30.173 --> 11:32.207
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

11:32.209 --> 11:35.410
That's got to put some starch
in the upper flermin.

11:37.481 --> 11:38.446
What's that?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.281
Oh, it's a scaly
genital organ

11:40.283 --> 11:41.983
that grows between
his shoulder blades.

11:41.985 --> 11:45.053
Try not to touch it
when you're dancing.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.255
Excuse me.

11:47.257 --> 11:48.556
Where are you going?

11:48.558 --> 11:49.824
I can't do this.

11:49.826 --> 11:51.326
And for your information,
Leonard,

11:51.328 --> 11:53.194
the upper flermin doesn't grow
between my shoulder blades,

11:53.196 --> 11:55.497
it grows out of the belly button
on my neck.

11:59.269 --> 12:02.404
He's right, I was thinking
of the lower flermin.

12:04.574 --> 12:08.309
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart,
let him know we're close.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.911
That's a neat tattoo.

12:09.913 --> 12:13.314
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from
<i>Nightmare before Christmas.</i>

12:13.316 --> 12:14.549
Aw, that movie's
so cute.

12:14.551 --> 12:16.651
Do you like her because
you both have red hair?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.421
Uh, a little, but more
that she's covered in scars

12:19.423 --> 12:22.390
and can pull her own limbs off
and sew them back on.

12:24.194 --> 12:27.195
I like Cinderella.

12:28.632 --> 12:30.165
Did you know,
in the original book,

12:30.167 --> 12:32.200
the sisters cut off
their toes with knives

12:32.202 --> 12:34.102
in order to fit
in the glass slipper?

12:35.372 --> 12:38.239
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

12:39.609 --> 12:41.676
Hey, here comes
Stuart and his date.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.811
Oh, she's cute.

12:43.914 --> 12:45.647
Oh, my God.

12:45.649 --> 12:46.748
What?

12:46.750 --> 12:47.682
That's Jeanie.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.650
That's Jeanie?!

12:48.652 --> 12:50.418
Who's Jeanie?
Don't say it.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.587
That's Howard's cousin
that he had sex with.

12:55.926 --> 12:57.892
She is my second cousin.

12:57.894 --> 13:00.562
We were 15... I just said,
"Don't say it."

13:00.564 --> 13:02.230
No, it's okay.

13:02.232 --> 13:04.098
He told me that story
a long time ago.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.166
Raj!

13:05.168 --> 13:06.301
It was our first date,

13:06.303 --> 13:07.402
there was an
awkward silence.

13:07.404 --> 13:10.004
What was I
supposed to say?

13:14.244 --> 13:15.810
(gasps)

13:15.812 --> 13:17.979
Oh, it's beautiful.

13:17.981 --> 13:20.248
Oh, the girls really
did a nice job.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.349
Aw...

13:21.351 --> 13:22.817
I know I wasn't
into this before,

13:22.819 --> 13:25.353
but I'm so glad I get
to take you to your first prom.

13:25.355 --> 13:27.355
What makes you think
I didn't go to my prom?

13:27.357 --> 13:29.357
I went.
Well, who'd you go with?

13:29.359 --> 13:33.328
I took a little lady
I like to call loneliness.

13:33.330 --> 13:34.496
Aw...

13:34.498 --> 13:35.864
Aw, it's all right.

13:35.866 --> 13:37.165
We ended up having a threesome

13:37.167 --> 13:39.133
with her friend humiliation,
so...

13:41.438 --> 13:43.738
Well, if I would have been
there and saw you alone,

13:43.740 --> 13:45.006
I would've asked you
to dance.

13:45.008 --> 13:46.107
No, you wouldn't have.

13:46.109 --> 13:47.208
Well, you don't
know that.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.676
It was before
my growth spurt.

13:48.678 --> 13:49.811
What, that already happened?

13:49.813 --> 13:51.813
(imitates laughter)

13:51.815 --> 13:53.781
Very funny.

13:53.783 --> 13:55.350
Well, you wouldn't
have asked me either.

13:55.352 --> 13:56.584
I would have asked you.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.452
(scoffs)

13:57.454 --> 13:58.620
In my head.

13:58.622 --> 14:00.388
(chuckles)

14:00.390 --> 14:02.790
On the way home.

14:02.792 --> 14:05.059
While I was having a good cry.

14:09.399 --> 14:11.599
(knocking on door)

14:11.601 --> 14:12.867
Sheldon, can I come in?

14:12.869 --> 14:15.203
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:15.205 --> 14:16.437
Why not?

14:16.439 --> 14:18.573
According to an online
message board,

14:18.575 --> 14:20.742
I may be having a panic attack.

14:20.744 --> 14:22.977
SoccerMom09 had
similar symptoms.

14:24.814 --> 14:29.117
But to be fair, the twins were
a real handful that day.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.518
You're making me worry.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.653
What's going on?

14:31.655 --> 14:35.557
What's going on is we're
about to go to a prom.

14:35.559 --> 14:36.691
And there's
a great deal of pressure

14:36.693 --> 14:38.660
on young couples
like us to engage in

14:38.662 --> 14:42.997
what Mr. Bob Eubanks
called making whoopee.

14:42.999 --> 14:44.632
What pressure?

14:44.634 --> 14:46.434
All I said was
you look handsome.

14:46.436 --> 14:49.170
Can you please
open the door?

14:49.172 --> 14:51.005
It's not just that.

14:51.007 --> 14:53.575
Leonard and Penny also
made comments about it.

14:53.577 --> 14:55.209
And I'm not blind.

14:55.211 --> 14:57.745
Even I looked twice
when I saw my posterior

14:57.747 --> 14:59.781
in these tuxedo pants.

15:01.952 --> 15:04.552
So, I met Jeanie
at your Aunt Gladys'.

15:04.554 --> 15:06.054
She passed me
the Manischewitz,

15:06.056 --> 15:07.755
I took one look
at this punim,

15:07.757 --> 15:10.925
and I almost plotzed
on the kugel.

15:12.729 --> 15:15.296
Is this what I sound like
when I talk about India?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.201
So, my mother's okay
with this?

15:20.203 --> 15:22.670
Why would your mother have
a problem with me and Stuart?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.773
'Cause they have a weird,
inappropriate relationship.

15:25.775 --> 15:29.210
Weirder than what you and I
did in my dad's Corolla?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.681
This is so messed up.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.784
I know, I'm having
the best time.

15:36.786 --> 15:39.621
Why would you even come to this?

15:39.623 --> 15:41.122
Didn't you know I'd be here?

15:41.124 --> 15:43.091
It was a long
time ago, Howard.

15:43.093 --> 15:45.259
And you're only second
cousins, who cares?

15:45.261 --> 15:47.729
So, you knew and you
brought her anyway?

15:47.731 --> 15:50.732
Oh, so she's good enough
for Howard, but not for me?!

15:50.734 --> 15:51.699
Yeah.

15:51.701 --> 15:52.700
Yeah, go have weird
relationships

15:52.702 --> 15:53.801
with your own
mother and cousin.

15:53.803 --> 15:54.803
This is his turf.

15:54.804 --> 15:56.004
Yeah.

15:59.476 --> 16:02.610
Well, I might not have
asked you to dance then,

16:02.612 --> 16:05.079
but I will ask you now.
There's no music.

16:05.081 --> 16:06.314
I don't care.

16:06.316 --> 16:07.515
We'll make
our own music.

16:07.517 --> 16:09.517
My God, who's the dork now?

16:09.519 --> 16:10.685
(scoffs)

16:11.521 --> 16:13.721
(giggles)

16:17.460 --> 16:19.894
Thank you for
wearing your flats.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.096
Thank you for
wearing your heels.

16:24.501 --> 16:26.034
Mmm.

16:26.036 --> 16:27.368
Look at me.

16:27.370 --> 16:30.605
Dancing with the prettiest
girl at the prom.

16:30.607 --> 16:32.674
Want to take a picture
of us and send it

16:32.676 --> 16:35.410
to your old friends
in the chess club?

16:35.412 --> 16:38.312
I sent them a bikini shot
of you years ago.

16:41.484 --> 16:43.918
This is nice.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.887
I kind of wish
no one else was coming.

16:45.889 --> 16:48.956
I know, me, too.

16:48.958 --> 16:52.794
But it will be fun to have a
prom without all the drama.

16:55.799 --> 16:57.265
Howie, get off of him!

16:57.267 --> 17:00.702
Not until he stops humping
his way up my family tree!

17:02.706 --> 17:05.306
Sheldon, this is silly.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.773
I'm not missing another prom.

17:06.776 --> 17:07.875
I'm going upstairs now.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.410
Good-bye.

17:09.412 --> 17:12.512
I really did think
you looked pretty.

17:12.515 --> 17:14.348
You did?

17:14.349 --> 17:16.684
Yes.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.087
So much so that
I started to panic.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.021
Well, you can relax.

17:21.991 --> 17:24.525
Just because you think
I look pretty

17:24.527 --> 17:26.961
doesn't mean we have
to spend the night together.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.598
Were you hoping we would
because it's prom?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.934
I'm always hoping.

17:34.170 --> 17:38.506
But tonight I just wanted
to have a nice time with you.

17:38.508 --> 17:41.676
And maybe dance
with someone who has arms.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.413
Thank you for understanding.

17:45.415 --> 17:47.749
Of course I understand.

17:49.719 --> 17:52.286
Sheldon,

17:52.288 --> 17:54.288
there's something else
I've been wanting to say,

17:54.290 --> 17:56.257
but before I do,
I just...

17:56.259 --> 17:59.994
I want you to know that you
don't have to say it back.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.963
I know you're not ready,

18:01.965 --> 18:03.498
and I don't want you to say it

18:03.500 --> 18:05.099
just because
social convention dictates...

18:05.101 --> 18:07.068
I love you, too.

18:10.573 --> 18:12.573
You said it.

18:12.575 --> 18:15.243
There's no denying
I have feelings for you

18:15.245 --> 18:17.612
that can't be explained
in any other way.

18:18.648 --> 18:22.650
I briefly considered
that I had a brain parasite.

18:25.121 --> 18:27.789
But that seems even
more farfetched.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.794
The only conclusion was love.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.432
I know what's happening.

18:39.769 --> 18:42.203
This is a panic attack.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.806
SoccerMom09 says to lie down
with your feet elevated.

18:44.808 --> 18:45.973
Okay.

18:45.975 --> 18:47.809
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

18:47.811 --> 18:49.410
Just because I love you
doesn't mean

18:49.412 --> 18:51.345
girls are allowed in my room.

19:07.074 --> 19:08.974
Okay.

19:08.976 --> 19:10.676
Here we go...

19:10.678 --> 19:13.245
Say "Cheese"!

19:15.649 --> 19:18.150
Say "Cheese"!

19:20.654 --> 19:23.288
Say "Cousin"!

19:25.926 --> 19:27.626
Say...

19:27.628 --> 19:28.628
(cell phone rings)

19:28.629 --> 19:29.629
Oh, sorry.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.830
Hang on, sorry.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.567
Hey, Debbie.

19:35.569 --> 19:37.602
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm
here with Jeanie.

19:38.331 --> 19:40.473
Okay, but we're just friends.

19:40.682 --> 19:44.041
It's... Yeah. I got to go.
