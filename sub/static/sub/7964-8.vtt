WEBVTT

00:32.360 --> 00:34.200
Drinks voucher for tonight.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.840
There's a weekly party out front.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.080
Welcome.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.600
Three, two, one...

00:58.360 --> 01:00.920
-That's not tequila.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.520
-It's Caribbean tequila.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.360
Oh, guess what? I did it.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.000
I got it done this afternoon.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.480
No way. You didn't.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.360
Is that a moth?

01:11.400 --> 01:12.960
It's a butterfly.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.400
Represents freedom, new beginnings...

01:15.440 --> 01:18.000
Stop staring at it. It is not a moth.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.920
I'm only joking, it's amazing. Seriously, Perrie.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.360
I mean, the fact that you're actually here at your...

01:23.400 --> 01:25.280
At my age?

01:25.320 --> 01:26.840
I might be twice as old as you,

01:26.880 --> 01:29.480
but I bet I can still drink you under the table.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.520
-No. -Yes.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.680
-Uh... -Right.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.000
Caller, hold the line!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.520
This time next week we'll be back home.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.840
Yeah.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.040
Be nice to be back.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.480
I come bearing shots and...

01:52.520 --> 01:54.800
-Leo. -Leo. I knew that.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.760
How you doing, Leo? I'm Griff.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.560
-This is my girlfriend, Sian. -Hey.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.080
-Hi. -PERRIE: Right!

02:00.120 --> 02:03.760
Let's get this party started.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.320
GRIFF:  Ready? Three...

02:36.840 --> 02:38.760
I just want to check that we're cool, yeah?

02:38.800 --> 02:41.800
Eh

02:41.840 --> 02:42.960
Yeah, I said I wouldn't.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.360
Cool.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.040
Better get her to bed.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.560
She's lucky to have you.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.520
GRIFF: Oh, the other way around, I reckon.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.760
PERRIE: Don't dismiss it.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.520
Take care of her. Look after her.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.160
You're so lovely.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.640
Oh...

03:06.680 --> 03:07.840
PERRIE: I'm sorry.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.440
I've had too much to drink.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.640
It's fine. Honestly, don't worry.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.360
I better head back.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.840
You want someone to walk you back?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.160
No, no, no. Don't be silly.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.240
Goodnight.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.640
-Goodnight. -BOTH: Goodnight.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.440
Well, that was awkward.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.280
Hey, you.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.800
Let's get you to bed, eh?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.960
No, I'm fine.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.600
See you tomorrow, man. Have a good one.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.960
-Come here. -Oops.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.320
You hear that?

04:24.360 --> 04:25.520
There's someone in there.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.200
What's going on?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.120
ASTOR: Stand back. What?

04:42.320 --> 04:43.920
No. Sian!

04:44.720 --> 04:45.880
GRIFF: Sian!

05:16.640 --> 05:20.080
HUMPHREY: So, this is my suit for JP's wedding.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.760
Which tailor did you use?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.400
HUMPHREY: Dwayne recommended him.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.200
What do you think?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.000
Both of you. A touch bold.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.320
My eldest brother,

05:42.360 --> 05:46.040
he's about the same size so maybe I could ask

05:42.360 --> 05:46.040
to borrow something from him.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.280
-Yeah.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.360
Dwayne, um...

05:50.400 --> 05:51.600
Top of the morning to you. Really?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.600
Well, we're on our way.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.520
Florence.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.880
Duty calls. You're driving.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.880
Sorry.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.960
DWAYNE: Chief.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.840
We've got a young woman inside.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.240
The paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene,

06:16.280 --> 06:18.320
but they still haven't taken away the body.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.440
Any idea what happened?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.800
It looks like she killed herself.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.760
-They discovered the body.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.480
DWAYNE: The boyfriend. Couple of guests.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.000
And that's the owner of the hostel, Astor.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.720
OK, let's take Astor.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.080
JP, keep the others here. I'll have a chat

06:31.760 --> 06:33.080
with them later.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.280
Yes, Chief.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.000
I tried the door but it wouldn't open.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.640
And then I came round back and smashed

06:50.040 --> 06:52.640
the window through.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.120
Do you know her?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.080
ASTOR: Her name is Sian.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.320
She'd been staying with us for about a week or so.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.360
Poor girl.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.320
She can't be more than what, 19?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.560
Twenty?

07:16.360 --> 07:18.760
Where were you when you heard the gunshot?

07:18.800 --> 07:20.880
I was cleaning the dorm room.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.280
What time was this?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.080
It must have been about 8:00.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.280
Yes, it was 8:00, 'cause I always start

07:24.120 --> 07:27.280
cleaning the same time.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.560
FLORENCE: When was the last time

07:27.320 --> 07:29.560
you saw Sian alive?

07:29.600 --> 07:30.920
Last night.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.280
I was at the bar.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.640
She was around at the party, I think.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.400
Why?

07:38.440 --> 07:41.720
Why would a young girl like that

07:38.440 --> 07:41.720
want to kill herself, man?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.560
Sorry. Who's saying she did?

07:43.600 --> 07:44.880
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.360
DWAYNE: You'd think so.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.360
-HUMPHREY: Well, let's see.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.360
She was found flush against the frosted glass door,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.040
which means that nobody could've shot her

07:52.080 --> 07:55.600
whilst inside the shower room and then exited via this door.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.760
And nobody could've entered or left via this window.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.280
Hence, why Astor here had to smash the shutters

07:58.800 --> 08:02.280
in order to gain access.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.800
-FLORENCE: But... -But,

08:03.840 --> 08:05.200
if you're planning to kill yourself,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.400
why bring a washbag?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.080
Why unpack your toiletries

08:09.120 --> 08:10.520
and then choose to shoot yourself?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.280
Where is her towel?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.760
If you were coming for a shower,

08:14.800 --> 08:17.400
you'd use a towel, wouldn't you?

08:17.440 --> 08:19.240
Yes, I hadn't really thought of that.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.160
So you think this wasn't a suicide?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.120
Uh, well, I'm not saying it wasn't

08:23.160 --> 08:25.000
not suicide, if you follow? Or to put it another way,

08:26.920 --> 08:30.440
Sian entered the shower room without a towel,

08:30.480 --> 08:32.720
unpacked her washbag, and only then

08:32.760 --> 08:36.000
decided to shoot herself at point-blank range.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.120
And why here? In a communal shower.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.120
Outside there's a secluded beach,

08:38.160 --> 08:42.120
a quiet, dense jungle.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.920
And where would someone with no knowledge of the island

08:44.960 --> 08:46.480
find a gun?

08:50.480 --> 08:51.640
DWAYNE: Astor?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.800
Something you'd like to tell us?

08:58.040 --> 08:59.680
I, uh...

08:59.720 --> 09:02.320
Oh, this isn't going to sound good but, um...

09:03.640 --> 09:05.120
That gun is mine.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.040
-It's legal and registered.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.200
But I don't know how she managed to get hold of it.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.120
I'll have to check in my office first, but

09:13.160 --> 09:15.600
that definitely looks like my gun.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.160
Hmm.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.840
Dwayne, I'll need you and JP

09:19.880 --> 09:22.040
to photograph the scene, release the body

09:19.880 --> 09:22.040
and dust for prints.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.800
Florence, you're with me.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.920
My name's Perrie.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.000
Perrie Campbell.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.400
Perrie. Right.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.680
And how do you know Sian?

09:31.720 --> 09:34.280
We met when she arrived a week or so ago.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.480
We got chatting.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.080
She was a really lovely girl.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.320
So, you're on holiday?

09:41.360 --> 09:43.040
No. I'm travelling.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.960
I see. And when was the last time you saw Sian alive?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.680
Last night. There was a party.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.000
We had a few drinks.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.840
And everything was fine.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.200
And in between you arriving back at the hostel

09:55.240 --> 09:57.480
and now, where have you been?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.400
Well, I came straight to bed.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.800
And then this morning,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.480
I was practising my yoga on the beach at 8:00,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.240
-and then I heard the gunshot.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.480
And so I came to find out what had happened.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.360
Can anyone confirm that?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.760
PERRIE: I don't know.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.960
There was a kayaking thing

10:16.000 --> 10:18.360
and everyone else took the boat to the next island.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.560
I'll take that as a no.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.520
Uh, name?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.560
I didn't.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.840
My flight got in yesterday afternoon.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.840
We met last night.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.760
And where were you when the gunshot was heard?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.440
<i></i>

10:35.360 --> 10:37.080
Who were you with?

10:37.120 --> 10:40.240
It was just me. As Perrie said, there was

10:37.120 --> 10:40.240
a boat trip organised.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.800
Um, given there was a boat trip,

10:41.840 --> 10:45.600
it was just you guys and Sian left in the hostel?

10:45.640 --> 10:47.680
Uh-huh. As far as I know.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.920
Uh, Griff, I know this must be a very

10:50.680 --> 10:53.920
difficult time for you.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.520
Um...

10:55.560 --> 10:58.360
How long have you and Sian been courting?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.160
Uh, three years next month.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.320
We met at work in the pub.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.560
And I was behind the bar.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.200
You've been together all summer travelling?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.360
One of those round-the-world tickets.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.280
She should start med school in September.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.000
That's why we're here.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.560
HUMPHREY: Hmm.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.160
Summer of fun...

11:21.200 --> 11:23.160
Before she... I'm sorry.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.600
When was the last time you, uh,

11:27.160 --> 11:29.240
saw Sian alive?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.160
Er, this morning.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.320
I was heading out for a run and she was

11:32.200 --> 11:35.320
heading for a shower.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.600
And what time is this?

11:36.640 --> 11:38.120
Er, 7:45.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.840
<i>I remember setting</i> <i>my watch to head out.</i>

11:41.880 --> 11:43.560
HUMPHREY: <i>And did anyone see you?</i>

11:43.600 --> 11:45.960
<i>I bought a bottle of water</i> <i>from the hut in the cliffs.</i>

11:52.240 --> 11:53.680
Would anyone know

11:53.720 --> 11:55.800
why Sian would have a reason to take her own life?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.120
All right, that's all for now. Thank you.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.080
FLORENCE: Are you sure you don't

12:07.000 --> 12:09.080
want me to drive, sir?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.920
HUMPHREY: No, Florence, it will

12:09.120 --> 12:11.920
help me to concentrate.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.280
So, Sian heads into the shower room.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.960
She unpacks her toiletries.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.720
And only then chooses to shoot herself at point-blank range.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.160
She doesn't bring a towel which makes no sense...

12:25.200 --> 12:27.280
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.000
Are you OK

12:33.360 --> 12:34.840
Gosh, it's you.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.080
It's you, isn't it?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.000
It's me.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.680
Milky hot chocolate.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.520
-Sometimes a blueberry muffin. -Oh!

12:44.760 --> 12:46.160
My goodness. Wow.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.080
Florence, this is Martha.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.480
-Hi. -Um, she used to work

12:49.520 --> 12:52.560
back in the coffee shop back in ol' Blighty.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.160
What are you doing here?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.880
Oh, um, you know, travelling.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.000
Finding myself.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.680
Nearly getting mowed down.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.920
-I'm so sorry. -Oh, no. It was me.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.920
I wasn't looking.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.240
-Yeah, um... -Oh.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.760
How are you?

13:08.800 --> 13:10.040
-How's, uh... -Oh.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.600
-Dylan. -Yes.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.320
We consciously uncoupled.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.080
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh, don't be. I'm not.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.240
Completely the right decision. Me too.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.160
Yes, uh, all for the good.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.240
So, um...

13:27.280 --> 13:29.200
This is where they transferred you?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.640
Yes.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.720
Beats roundabouts and rain, I guess.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.800
Yes.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.160
You too.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.720
Thanks. Trying to cut out wheat, actually.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.760
Mmm-hmm.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.840
-Oh. It's lovely.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.280
-Yes.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.080
It's awful what's happened.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.680
We all found out when we got back

13:53.120 --> 13:55.680
from the boat trip.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.760
You're investigating, I presume?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.680
Yes, yes. I am so, uh,

13:59.720 --> 14:00.960
if you hear of anything at all,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.680
then do let me know.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.880
-And sorry about nearly mowing you down.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.880
-Oh...

14:06.920 --> 14:08.560
Not at all.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.040
All right. Marv.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.600
Sorry

14:16.640 --> 14:18.160
Marvellous.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.400
Marv.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.760
It's just something I'm trying, uh...

14:23.680 --> 14:24.880
Yes.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.640
Right, um...

14:28.680 --> 14:30.240
-It's been lovely to see you. -Oh, you too.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.360
-Bye. -HUMPREY: Bye.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.720
She seems nice.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.480
Yes. Yes, she is. Yes.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.240
Yeah, she's nice.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.000
Wow, flowers. Gosh.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.680
Uh, sorry, sir.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.480
They were meant to deliver everything

15:00.720 --> 15:02.480
straight to the church,

15:02.520 --> 15:04.160
but they got the wrong address.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
Rosey is on her way to pick them all up.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.880
No, not a problem, JP.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.320
Anything we can do to help. You only get married once.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.640
You hope.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.000
I'm so sorry for your loss.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.880
We'll be in touch.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.600
Um, that was Sian's mother.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.520
She didn't believe Sian would take her own life.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.760
She was headed to medical school.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
Her life ahead of her.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.880
Apparently Sian had suffered from anxiety and depression

15:28.840 --> 15:31.880
during her exams,

15:31.920 --> 15:34.600
but she had got through it with the help

15:31.920 --> 15:34.600
of the boyfriend.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.440
Her mother spoke very highly of him.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.040
-COMPUTER:<i> Yee-haw.</i>

15:39.960 --> 15:41.400
HUMPHREY: Sorry, um,

15:41.440 --> 15:43.600
I've done something. Every time I get an e-mail...

15:43.640 --> 15:44.800
COMPUTER:<i> Yee-haw.</i>

15:44.840 --> 15:46.280
HUMPHREY: I can't turn it off.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.080
I don't know what I've done.  Settings...

15:52.240 --> 15:53.560
Sorry. You were saying. -Background.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.920
-Uh, yes.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.400
Uh, the victim, Sian Evans, 19,

15:57.440 --> 15:59.040
born and raised in Cardiff.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.720
An A-grade student about to go to Edinburgh University.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.320
Griff Morgan, 27, the boyfriend,

16:04.360 --> 16:06.840
works at the local pub and DJ's there.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.520
JP: Leo Richards, 21,

16:08.560 --> 16:10.000
originally from Hastings

16:10.040 --> 16:12.560
but is now studying history and politics at Warwick.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.960
DWAYNE: Astor Henri, age 42, born locally.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.240
Turns out the gun was registered and legal,

16:18.280 --> 16:21.480
and the only fingerprints found on the weapon

16:18.280 --> 16:21.480
belonged to Sian.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.160
Astor's been running the hostel for five years.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.320
Married for two.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.520
JP: Perrie Campbell, 43.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.920
-Mmm-hmm.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.480
Anyway, uh, looks like she worked

16:31.640 --> 16:34.480
in a supermarket for years,

16:38.440 --> 16:39.880
Is that a real place, Chief?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.600
I actually went to a christening

16:39.920 --> 16:41.600
in Cowbridge once.

16:41.640 --> 16:45.280
It's not a million miles from Cardiff,

16:41.640 --> 16:45.280
uh, if I remember.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.320
So you think there's a chance that Perrie and Sian

16:47.360 --> 16:49.800
might have known each other prior to arriving

16:47.360 --> 16:49.800
on Saint Marie?

16:49.840 --> 16:51.640
Well, perhaps their paths might have crossed.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.400
Uh, have a dig around, JP. See what you can find.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.520
Yes, Chief.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.920
Right. So,

16:56.960 --> 16:59.640
Sian Evans was found dead inside the shower room

16:59.680 --> 17:01.160
at Honore Youth Hostel,

17:01.200 --> 17:03.800
just after a gunshot was heard at 8:00 am.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.720
She was last seen alive

17:05.760 --> 17:08.560
by her boyfriend at 7:45 am.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.720
She had been shot at point-blank range

17:10.760 --> 17:14.080
and her body was found slumped flush against

17:10.760 --> 17:14.080
the shower room door.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.640
Which means that nobody could have shot her

17:14.120 --> 17:17.640
from inside the shower room

17:17.680 --> 17:19.640
and then left via the door.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.280
And nobody could have entered or left via the window,

17:22.320 --> 17:25.760
which is why Astor smashed the shutters

17:22.320 --> 17:25.760
in order to enter.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.560
Quite. The gun belonging to Astor

17:25.800 --> 17:29.560
was found in Sian's hand.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.000
Did she take her own life?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.480
Some might say it's possible.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.240
But why, if you're intending to take your own life,

17:35.280 --> 17:36.600
do you take a washbag,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.240
unpack it and only then choose to kill yourself?

17:39.280 --> 17:40.560
Uh, Chief?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.840
We also found these in Sian's possession.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.160
Looks like ecstasy.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.640
Right. Well, let's get them over to the lab

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
and wait for toxicology to confirm what they are.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.880
We also found her towel.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.640
It was on her bed, bone dry.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.040
JP: Sir, you have to come and look at this.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.320
OK, so I ran a quick internet search on Perrie Campbell,

17:54.080 --> 17:57.320
and look.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.280
First hit articles from a local newspaper.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.840
"Missing Cowbridge wife disappears.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.840
Husband appeals for help."

18:04.880 --> 18:07.160
The mysterious case of the runaway wife.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.880
So, Perrie is married.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.400
FLORENCE: She didn't mention anything about a husband.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.920
Why is she here if he's back in England?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.400
Wales, Florence.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.280
-Never say that to a Welshman.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.440
Never say that to an Englishman,

18:18.320 --> 18:20.440
come to think of it.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.880
Uh, so according to this,

18:21.920 --> 18:25.160
Cowbridge is only seven miles west from Cardiff.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.080
Close enough for me. Florence?

18:29.880 --> 18:31.040
Right.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.600
HUMPHREY: Oh, you're a writer.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.400
It's just a story.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.840
It's not finished yet.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.440
You know, Herman Melville once said,

18:52.480 --> 18:54.320
"To produce a mighty book,

18:54.360 --> 18:56.160
"one must choose a mighty theme."

18:57.520 --> 18:58.720
Deception. Deceit.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.400
Fleeing of one's homeland.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.280
Pretty big themes, wouldn't you say?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.200
Why did you leave your husband?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.320
Is it relevant?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.080
-Fairly relevant. -OK.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.000
I left because I couldn't stay.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.320
Every night before bed,

19:19.360 --> 19:20.760
I put out two cups,

19:20.800 --> 19:23.520
placed the tea bags inside ready for the morning.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.160
One night, I went to bed, I looked at those two mugs

19:23.560 --> 19:27.160
and I thought,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.320
"There's gotta be more than this."

19:29.360 --> 19:33.400
So I walked away and I never went back.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.520
I knew that there was a whole world out there.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.680
Now I can see it.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.240
We know you lived just outside Cardiff.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.080
Maybe you knew Sian from back home.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.800
Maybe she recognised you

19:45.840 --> 19:48.120
and there was talk of her getting in touch

19:45.840 --> 19:48.120
with your husband.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.560
Tell him where you are.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.280
Sian and I had never met before.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.520
I had nothing to do with what happened to her.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.600
I don't want you to contact my husband.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.840
I'm happy here.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.080
She was crying.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.640
Last night.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.120
I'd gone to bed.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.560
<i>But I wasn't feeling to good.</i> <i>I needed some air,</i>

20:10.600 --> 20:14.080
<i>so I went outside and she was</i> <i>with Griff and she was crying.</i>

20:14.120 --> 20:16.960
-I have no idea.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.720
I should have said something this morning,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.880
but I didn't want to upset Griff

20:19.760 --> 20:22.880
any more than was necessary.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.760
Ah, sir, how did it go?

20:31.800 --> 20:34.280
Well, Perrie is not the most stable of people, granted,

20:34.320 --> 20:36.880
but a cold I'm not so sure.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.080
We might have something.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.760
We've been going through the phone records.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.240
Yes, they were e-mailed over to us by the network provider.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.720
Now these are all the numbers

20:44.760 --> 20:47.480
Sian called or texted over the last three months.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.120
But there is one number we could not account for.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.640
Highlighted in orange.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.800
It's Leo, Chief.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.040
We spoke to the phone company

20:54.080 --> 20:56.080
and there are text messages and calls,

20:56.120 --> 20:58.840
between him and Sian going back months,

20:58.880 --> 21:02.720
but there is no record of any of these calls or text

20:58.880 --> 21:02.720
messages on Sian's phone.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.800
-They've all been deleted. -So we did some more digging,

21:04.840 --> 21:07.440
and it turns out that Leo was in Phuket

21:04.840 --> 21:07.440
three months ago

21:07.480 --> 21:10.120
exactly the same time as Sian and Griff.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.240
The text messages began shortly afterwards.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.000
Wow, that is barn-storming work from the two of you.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.360
Now, let's get the phone over to the lab,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.360
see what they can recover.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.720
Also, Dwayne, I'd like you to check Leo, Sian

21:17.400 --> 21:20.720
and Griff's social media.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.680
The face thingy, the tweeter, see what you can find.

21:22.720 --> 21:23.840
Yes, Chief.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.440
Let's head over and talk to Leo.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.880
HUMPHREY: Ah, Rosey.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.240
-Hello. -DWAYNE: Ah, Miss Fabrice.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.880
-FLORENCE: Hi, Rosey. -Hello.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.200
Van's all loaded.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.640
I'll take the flowers over to the church.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.120
Hmm. Beauty, brains and brawn, uh?

21:36.160 --> 21:38.000
You're a lucky man, you know, JP?

21:38.040 --> 21:40.280
Here are the nametags for the wedding favours.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.160
You have done the wedding favours?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.480
Yes, of course.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.680
Great.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.040
And my Aunt Esme's coming now,

21:46.080 --> 21:48.400
so you might have to rejig the seating plan.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.560
OK. Yes. Rejig.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.960
OK.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.080
Bye-bye.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.360
Bye.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.520
You haven't done the favours, have you?

21:59.560 --> 22:01.080
Haven't even started.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.800
Aunt Esme?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.720
I've never even met Aunt Esme.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.280
You only met Rosey's mum two weeks ago.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.800
Relax, JP.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.360
It's a whirlwind romance.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.040
-These things happen. -Whoa. Whoa.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.640
What do you mean, whirlwind?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.200
You know, whirlwind.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.600
Fast.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.040
Good, but fast.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.200
I could charge you for perverting the course

22:23.360 --> 22:26.200
of justice right now.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.480
We need to see your mobile phone.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.960
We know that you and Sian

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
have been exchanging phone calls and text messages

22:32.040 --> 22:33.600
for almost three months.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.640
We also know that three months ago

22:33.640 --> 22:35.640
you spent a week

22:35.680 --> 22:38.200
on the same island at the same time.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.320
Nothing, sir.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.640
Do you delete all your calls and text messages or just

22:40.360 --> 22:43.640
the incriminating ones?

22:43.680 --> 22:46.560
We can do this back at the station,

22:43.680 --> 22:46.560
if you'd prefer.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.360
OK, look, we met a few months ago in Phuket.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.400
<i>She was hot. We hooked up.</i>

22:53.440 --> 22:55.160
FLORENCE: Then what happened?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.360
Nothing.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.720
<i>We spent a week together.</i>

22:59.760 --> 23:00.920
<i>Her boyfriend wasn't there.</i>

23:00.960 --> 23:02.720
<i>They'd had an argument.</i>

23:02.760 --> 23:05.320
She wanted to go to this festival that everyone

23:02.760 --> 23:05.320
was talking about.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.960
He didn't want her to go.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.480
She said he could be like that, controlling.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.200
So, she just left him, we went,

23:12.240 --> 23:14.000
and we spent a few days together after that.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.400
It was just sex.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.080
I guess she sent a few texts. There were a few calls.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.760
What, you just happened to bump

23:20.120 --> 23:22.760
into her again on this island?

23:22.800 --> 23:25.280
Most British travellers book through the same website.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.040
That's the same flights, same hostels,

23:27.080 --> 23:28.240
people bump into each other.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.680
So why lie?

23:29.720 --> 23:31.320
I'm not exactly going to volunteer this information

23:31.360 --> 23:33.320
in front of her boyfriend, am I?

23:33.360 --> 23:35.040
I don't want to put him through any more grief.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.960
We'll be in touch.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.280
So, what do you think, sir?

23:41.320 --> 23:43.120
Well, if Sian and Leo had been intimate,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.240
and Griff had somehow learnt of this...

23:45.280 --> 23:47.520
-Strong motive. -HUMPHREY: Yes.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.640
HUMPHREY: Excuse me.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.840
Excuse me.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.720
Just have a couple of follow-up questions,

23:55.880 --> 23:57.720
if that's OK?

23:57.760 --> 24:00.000
-Sorry, I was miles away. -No, of course.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.240
Uh, we understand that

24:02.280 --> 24:03.840
you and Sian had an argument,

24:03.880 --> 24:06.600
which led to you parting company

24:03.880 --> 24:06.600
for a week in Phuket.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.480
How'd you know about that?

24:08.520 --> 24:09.920
Is it true?

24:11.680 --> 24:13.120
Yeah, but...

24:13.160 --> 24:14.360
It was nothing. Nothing?

24:17.680 --> 24:19.760
It was about a stupid party

24:19.800 --> 24:22.280
she wanted to go to in the middle of nowhere.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.680
It was dangerous and I didn't want her to go.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.000
We had a week apart.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.800
Then we were together again and it was fine.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.520
Did Sian tell you about Leo?

24:33.560 --> 24:34.720
What about him?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.800
They met.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.280
The week you and Sian were apart, they were together.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.080
They were intimate.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.640
They had been exchanging calls and text messages

24:41.120 --> 24:44.640
since that time.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.200
We also have a witness who claims

24:49.240 --> 24:52.600
she saw you and Sian the night before she died,

24:52.640 --> 24:55.080
and Sian had been crying.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.520
That wasn't an argument.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.160
She was scared about heading off to uni.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.240
I mean, she could get like that in her head.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.320
She used to call it her washing machine head.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.560
God.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.080
I thought they only met last night.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.560
I had no idea.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.800
What does it mean?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.680
Your necklace.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.040
It's the Thai symbol for love.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.280
Isn't it?

25:23.880 --> 25:25.120
Yeah.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.800
Sian gave it to me.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.920
Why don't you ask her out for a drink?

25:46.960 --> 25:49.320
-Um... -What's the worst

25:46.960 --> 25:49.320
that could happen?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.400
You'll be great.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.400
Right. Uh, yes.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.760
<i>Carpe diem</i> and all that.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.040
Hello.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.800
Oh, hi.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.000
How are you

26:14.040 --> 26:15.240
Yes.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.920
Good. Good. So...

26:19.280 --> 26:20.520
Yes...

26:20.560 --> 26:22.280
Er, so there's a bar.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.960
It's run by a lovely woman called Catherine

26:22.320 --> 26:24.960
and they do drinks.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.600
Um...

26:27.880 --> 26:30.480
Coffee, beer, cocktails.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.040
Soft drinks, mocktails, water.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.400
I can get you a menu if you like.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.840
-Oh, I... -And then you could

26:34.880 --> 26:36.840
choose something you'd like

26:36.880 --> 26:38.480
and I could buy it for you. A drink.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.600
I could buy you a drink tonight.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.160
Or I could just order when I'm there.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.720
That would work too. Yes.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.160
Yes, great.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.200
7:00?

26:53.240 --> 26:55.440
-That sounds lovely. -Great. See you then.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.000
-See you then. -Yes.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.280
-She said yes. -Oh, that's great.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.480
Yes, no, it's great. Let's go.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.320
What's wrong?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.480
I sat on her yoghurt. Quick before she notices.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.920
Now we know that Sian and Leo were together in Phuket.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.760
We also know that

27:14.800 --> 27:18.120
since that time they've exchanged numerous

27:14.800 --> 27:18.120
calls and text messages.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.600
We're still waiting on the lab

27:19.640 --> 27:21.400
to come back to us with the content

27:19.640 --> 27:21.400
of the messages.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.560
Yes. Dwayne, did anything come up

27:21.440 --> 27:25.560
from Griff's social media?

27:25.600 --> 27:29.320
Hmm, some posts about the disco

27:25.600 --> 27:29.320
he ran at his local pub.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.800
Some photos of him and Sian travelling.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.360
Nothing out of the ordinary, really.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.440
HUMPHREY: OK. So,

27:36.480 --> 27:38.560
what of Perrie Campbell?

27:38.600 --> 27:42.400
Well, we know she walked out on

27:38.600 --> 27:42.400
her husband to see the world.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.400
Did Sian recognise her? Did she kill to

27:42.440 --> 27:45.400
maintain her anonymity?

27:45.440 --> 27:46.840
We do not know.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.120
What we do know is that Sian Evans

27:46.880 --> 27:49.120
was found dead,

27:49.160 --> 27:51.320
slumped flush against the shower room door.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.160
But as no one could have got in or out of there,

27:54.200 --> 27:56.160
how on earth was she murdered?

27:56.200 --> 27:58.920
A question I fear will not be answered this evening.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.400
So, thank you,

27:58.960 --> 28:01.400
that's all for today.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.160
Back in first thing.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.880
Good luck, sir.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
You'll be great.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.760
Yes, thank you.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.560
Er, I'm on wedding duty, sir.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.720
Oh, right.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.440
Well, try not to stay too late.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.400
Do you think I'm getting married too soon?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.040
Gosh, where did that come from?

29:04.520 --> 29:06.040
Oh, no.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.160
Er...

29:09.200 --> 29:11.480
Why don't you let me make a quick phone call

29:11.520 --> 29:13.480
and then you can tell me all about it.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.360
Oh, sir, I'm sure you have more important things to do.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.120
JP, this is important.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.760
Just give me one minute. OK?

29:26.360 --> 29:27.960
<i>Catherine, it's me, Humphrey.</i>

29:28.000 --> 29:29.480
<i> Hello.</i>

29:29.520 --> 29:30.880
<i>I'm meant to be</i> <i>meeting someone.</i>

29:30.920 --> 29:33.600
<i>Well, thing is,</i> <i>it's a date, actually.</i>

29:33.640 --> 29:36.480
<i>Thing is, I'm going</i> <i>to be a little late.</i>

29:36.520 --> 29:39.680
<i>Now, the lady in question goes</i> <i>by the name of Martha.</i>

29:39.720 --> 29:41.520
<i>Er, she's got</i> <i>blonde hair, um...</i>

29:41.560 --> 29:44.560
<i>Uh, looks like</i> <i>she has a good heart.</i>

29:44.600 --> 29:46.560
<i>If you could let her</i> <i>know I've been</i>

29:44.600 --> 29:46.560
<i>held up in work,</i>

29:46.600 --> 29:47.880

29:47.920 --> 29:49.200
<i>Er, right.</i>

29:49.240 --> 29:52.080
<i>Yeah. That's it. Right.</i> <i>Um, thank you.</i>

30:00.760 --> 30:01.960
They told you then?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.200
JP: I only met her a few months ago.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.120
And now there's wedding favours.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.640
Table plans.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.040
Aunt Esme.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.800
I mean, this is all happening so fast,

30:27.840 --> 30:29.520
and in like two days' time,

30:29.560 --> 30:31.880
I have to declare in front of my family and friends

30:31.920 --> 30:34.760
that we're going to spend the rest

30:31.920 --> 30:34.760
of our lives together?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.240
Hmm.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.840
You know what? It's a whirlwind romance.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.640
That's exactly what Dwayne called it.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.520
Whoa. Rewind.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.000
You've been taking to Dwayne?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.760
Yes.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
All right, first things first.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.440
In matters of the heart,

30:49.480 --> 30:51.640
advice from Dwayne Myers is to be taken

30:49.480 --> 30:51.640
with a rather large

30:51.680 --> 30:54.000
pinch of salt.

30:54.040 --> 30:57.120
This is nothing but cold feet, perfectly normal.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.360
So, I remember the night before my wedding...

30:59.400 --> 31:02.840
The excitement, the anticipation.

31:02.880 --> 31:06.840
But there was also a mild, low-level,

31:06.880 --> 31:10.800
but nonetheless very real sense of panic.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.160
But you knew her longer than a few months?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.720
Well, yes.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.280
Look, you're a kind and genuine

31:18.640 --> 31:22.280
and honest man, JP.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.720
Now, I've seen you and Rosey together,

31:24.760 --> 31:27.280
and there's something very real there.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.880
Yeah.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.560
Oh, yeah, you're right.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.760
You're right, it's cold feet.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.080
Uh, as you say.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.120
You're gonna make Rosey a very happy woman.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.760
Yeah, I hope so.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.840
I know so.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.040
Come here.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.000
COMPUTER:<i> Yee-haw!</i>

31:56.600 --> 31:57.880
Is she still here?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.120
Who?

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
Martha.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.760
-No.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.040
What did it say?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.520
Well, I'm meant to be meeting someone.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.160
Blonde. Pretty.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.400
-Very pretty. -Oh, her.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.560
-Yes.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.840
-You're very late. -Yes, I know.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.920
Oh...

32:15.960 --> 32:18.000
She left about half an hour ago.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.160
I'm afraid she didn't look too happy.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.280
Will you see her again?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.920
Yes. Yes, I'm sure I will.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.000
Well, this one's on me.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.240
Thank you.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.280
FLORENCE: So, how did it go last night?

32:46.320 --> 32:48.520
Uh, well, it... Uh, it actually, um,

32:48.560 --> 32:50.160
it fell through in the end.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.600
It's one of those things.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.800
But you'll rearrange?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.640
No, no, I don't think so.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.000
Um, I phoned the hostel this morning and she was

32:54.680 --> 32:58.000
about to check out.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.760
Right. Er, a little experiment.

32:59.800 --> 33:03.560
Er, outside, you two. Chop-chop. Outside.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.120
See if you can open this door.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.840
-It won't open, Chief. -Exactly.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.440
Now come inside.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.760
Now, try and leave whilst I keep my body in this position.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.040
DWAYNE: It can't be done. It's impossible, Chief.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.120
I know, and it's driving me to distraction.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.360
-Yes.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.320
I just spoke to the lab

33:40.360 --> 33:43.440
and they've confirmed that the drugs we found

33:40.360 --> 33:43.440
in Sian's bag were ecstasy.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.840
The lab also done a cross match on the bag

33:43.480 --> 33:47.840
and our exclusion prints.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.000
They found a match.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.680
Astor.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.680
Astor sold Sian the drugs?

33:52.720 --> 33:56.040
Right. Dwayne, JP, if you can conduct a search

33:52.720 --> 33:56.040
of Astor's quarters.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.320
Yes, Chief.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.520
Florence, you and I will talk to Griff.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.640
See if he can then shed any light on why Sian was

33:59.560 --> 34:02.640
in possession of the ecstasy.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.640
Yes.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.120
Thought you were gonna throw me the keys.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.560
They're on your desk.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.040
Yes, I knew that.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.400
HUMPHREY: Found these amongst Sian's possessions.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.600
Ecstasy.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.040
This a regular thing for her?

34:32.040 --> 34:33.840
No. No.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.440
She just wanted to kick back.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.640
Last few days away.

34:37.680 --> 34:40.400
Sian had heard that Astor could get a hold of the stuff.

34:41.800 --> 34:42.920
<i>I said no.</i>

34:42.960 --> 34:44.800
Come on. Nah, Sian.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.520
<i>Somehow she got them anyway.</i>

34:46.560 --> 34:49.680
I didn't understand how because I was

34:46.560 --> 34:49.680
looking after the money.

34:49.720 --> 34:53.280
She wouldn't tell me so I went to find

34:49.720 --> 34:53.280
Astor in his office,

34:53.320 --> 34:55.200
but he wasn't there, so

34:55.240 --> 34:57.440
I started looking for his drugs.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.480
<i>But I couldn't find them.</i>

34:59.520 --> 35:02.480
<i>When he arrived he just</i> <i>kept on denying that</i>

34:59.520 --> 35:02.480
<i>he'd given them to her.</i>

35:02.520 --> 35:04.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.760
But I know he's lying.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.440
You won't find anything.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.960
Ah, our hostel owner with a side line

35:13.480 --> 35:17.960
in class-A narcotics.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.840
HUMPHREY: The drugs you sold to Sian.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.040
They're not mine.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.560
The bag has got your prints on it.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.920
HUMPHREY: How'd you explain that?

35:28.800 --> 35:30.240
I remember now.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.120
I was cleaning the room and I find them on the floor.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.200
-Sorry. I need to take this.

35:35.240 --> 35:39.280
You do realise that lying to a police officer is quite

35:35.240 --> 35:39.280
a serious offence?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.400
I found this in the outside bins.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.080
HUMPHREY: Ah!

35:46.120 --> 35:47.520
Do these belong to you too, Astor?

35:49.680 --> 35:51.920
See, because we know you gave Sian the drugs,

35:51.960 --> 35:54.440
but we also know she didn't have any money.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.720
So, what was the arrangement?

36:01.640 --> 36:04.520
She came into my office a couple of days ago.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.040
Apparently the hot water was not working.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.320
<i>I was with someone.</i>

36:11.240 --> 36:12.720
<i>Someone who was not my wife.</i>

36:15.280 --> 36:17.480
<i>Sian said she</i> <i>wouldn't say anything.</i>

36:18.560 --> 36:19.960
I repaid her

36:20.000 --> 36:22.160
to say thank you and...

36:22.200 --> 36:23.520
And that was it.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.240
I swear that was it.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.360
The lab recovered the text messages

36:29.880 --> 36:34.360
Leo and Sian exchanged.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.280
They've just e-mailed them over.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.560
Oh!

36:40.400 --> 36:42.280
Oh, stone the crows!

36:45.400 --> 36:47.040
"Hey, sexy.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.480
"Thinking of you. Kiss. Kiss.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.480
"Why are you ignoring me?

36:51.520 --> 36:54.640
"Let me take you out for the day when we both

36:51.520 --> 36:54.640
get home. Kiss. Kiss."

36:54.680 --> 36:58.640
The text messages you sent Sian clearly show

36:54.680 --> 36:58.640
that you chased her.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.440
Her reply, "Please delete my number, I'm sorry,

36:58.680 --> 37:02.440
this was a mistake."

37:03.920 --> 37:05.640
You keep lying to us.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.080
Why?

37:08.120 --> 37:11.120
Because I liked her.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.560
FLORENCE: You liked her?

37:15.920 --> 37:17.120
She...

37:18.000 --> 37:19.920
Got under my skin,

37:19.960 --> 37:22.520
and in my head, and I couldn't get her out.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.600
So you followed her here

37:24.640 --> 37:26.160
to win her back?

37:26.200 --> 37:29.040
After she specifically told you

37:26.200 --> 37:29.040
to leave her alone.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.520
Knowing she had a long-term boyfriend.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.120
<i>Knowing all of that,</i> <i>you still turned up.</i>

37:37.200 --> 37:38.880
HUMPHREY: Went well, did it?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.800
She was not too impressed.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.840
We had it all out the night before she, um...

37:45.880 --> 37:47.440
The night we'd all been drinking.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.200
I'm here for you.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.000
-I just want to be with you. -I don't want to be with you.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.280
Sian.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.600
That made you angry?

37:58.640 --> 38:00.240
Knowing that she didn't want to be with you.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.320
Angry enough to kill?

38:04.520 --> 38:06.440
I had nothing to do with her death.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.040
Might want to get some ice on that.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.480
Now, we are missing something. What are we missing?

38:20.520 --> 38:23.680
-A conviction. -Yes. Thank you, uh, Dwayne.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.680
Sian Evans was found inside the shower room.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.120
Nobody could have shot Sian and then

38:25.720 --> 38:28.120
exited via the door.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.760
And it would have been impossible for

38:28.160 --> 38:30.760
anyone to have entered

38:30.800 --> 38:32.480
or exited via the window.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.240
Did she simply kill herself?

38:34.280 --> 38:37.120
Possibly, but the washbag would indicate that Sian

38:37.160 --> 38:39.520
entered the shower room in order to shower.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.000
But there was no towel.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.000
What of the suspects?

38:43.040 --> 38:45.320
Perrie Campbell, the woman who walked out on her husband.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.920
Did she kill to maintain her anonymity?

38:47.960 --> 38:50.080
And what of the hostel owner, Astor Henri?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.960
We know his gun was used to kill Sian.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.200
Though his prints were not found on the weapon.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.240
What of Leo? Leo the liar.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.480
We know that he'd had liaisons with Sian three months

38:56.280 --> 38:59.480
before he said they met.

38:59.520 --> 39:03.120
He subsequently bombarded her with

38:59.520 --> 39:03.120
text messages and phone calls.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.000
And finally, Griff the boyfriend.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.800
Did he somehow discover Sian's tryst with Leo?

39:08.840 --> 39:11.560
Did he want revenge

39:11.600 --> 39:13.240
Who did it?

39:14.440 --> 39:16.040
And how did they do it?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.280
You know who did it?

39:30.520 --> 39:33.360
-Not a sausage. -COMPUTER:<i> Yee-haw!</i>

39:35.120 --> 39:37.040
I feel really bad, sir.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.280
-We haven't cracked the case. -No.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.320
And time is rather getting on a bit, um...

39:43.360 --> 39:44.920
But, uh, you're off-duty now.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.480
It is time for a celebration. And that, JP, is an order.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.640
-Sir, the suit from my brother.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.640
-Yes.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.720
It's in the jeep.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.360
I'm sure it will be a good fit.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.560
OK, I'll come have a look. Thank you.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.560
Well,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.560
-all the best for the big day tomorrow.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.560
-Thank you, sir.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.800
Best of British.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.480
I feel sorry for the Chief, you know.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.400
I think he's a bit down about his date.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.640
Date?

40:12.680 --> 40:14.600
DWAYNE: Yes, he had a date with a woman last night.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.320
He didn't say much.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.680
I think she stood him up.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.320
The inspector was with me until pretty late last night.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.120
What was he doing with you?

40:24.160 --> 40:25.800
I had a bit of a wobble, that's all.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.640
A wobble

40:27.680 --> 40:29.280
Something you said about

40:29.320 --> 40:32.080
-me and Rosie and whirlwind romance.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.600
When did I say that?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.960
It doesn't matter.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.360
The point is, his date didn't stand him up.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.840
He didn't turn up because of me and my stupid wobble.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.200
-Fine. -Thank you so much, Minister.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.120
Mint?

41:07.160 --> 41:09.080
Oh. No. Thank you.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.600
No.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.240
Commissioner, would you like a mint?

41:21.360 --> 41:22.600
No.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.120

DWAYNE:<i> Anyway.</i>

43:11.200 --> 43:13.360

43:13.400 --> 43:17.560

43:17.600 --> 43:20.840
<i>I'm sorry,</i> <i>I mean, that's the last thing</i>

43:17.600 --> 43:20.840
<i>he wanted me to do.</i>

43:20.880 --> 43:23.920

43:35.400 --> 43:37.240
<i>I don't know how</i> <i>he did it either!</i>

43:43.640 --> 43:45.360
Where is her towel?

43:45.400 --> 43:47.080
COMPUTER:<i> Yee-haw!</i>

43:47.120 --> 43:48.560
See, I can't turn it off.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.480
We also found these in Sian's possessions.

43:50.520 --> 43:51.960
Nah, Sian.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.280
<i>Chief?</i>

44:03.320 --> 44:06.360
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, everyone. As you were. Carry on.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.680
<i>You know who killed her,</i> <i>don't you?</i>

44:10.720 --> 44:13.120
-Yes, I'm afraid I do. -Oh, no.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.400
I think you better go.

44:16.440 --> 44:19.200
No, no, no. I'll stay with you.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.240
It's fine. I get it.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.760
-Now, go. Just hurry back. -OK.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.640
Right.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.880
You'll need to change out of your glad rags en route.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.320
Florence, can you bring my drink and napkin

44:32.920 --> 44:35.320
and round up the suspects?

44:35.360 --> 44:37.360
JP, you're with me. There's something

44:35.360 --> 44:37.360
I need to check.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.200
-Let's go. -COMMISSIONER:

44:37.400 --> 44:39.200
I'll hold the fort here.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.120
Maybe you could entertain the troops,

44:39.240 --> 44:42.120
Commissioner.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.760
I've never been one for notes, Officer Myers.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.400
Florence?

44:46.440 --> 44:49.000
COMMISSIONER:<i> Seeing young</i> <i>Officer Hooper married today</i>

44:49.040 --> 44:51.240
<i>reminded me of</i> <i>my younger self.</i>

44:51.280 --> 44:54.000
<i>My first day on the force</i>

44:54.040 --> 44:55.400
<i>I had to wrestle...</i>

45:06.480 --> 45:08.600
-Yes.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.160
Remind me, JP.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.760
Sian had only recently accepted a place

45:10.200 --> 45:12.760
at med school.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.960
Where was she headed?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.160
-Edinburgh. -Edinburgh.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.400
That's interesting.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.680
It's very interesting indeed.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.600
Good afternoon.

45:31.640 --> 45:35.160
From the outset of this investigation,

45:35.200 --> 45:37.760
we have been unable to determine

45:37.800 --> 45:39.920
whether Sian had taken her own life

45:40.920 --> 45:42.520
or whether she had been murdered.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.160
Well, I can now tell you with absolute certainty

45:48.200 --> 45:49.480
that Sian did not take her own life.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.440
She was murdered.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.840
By one of you.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.960
Perrie.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.360
You arrived on this island determined to start afresh.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.240
Had you come across Sian back in Wales?

46:02.280 --> 46:05.440
Did she recognise you? Did you kill her to

46:02.280 --> 46:05.440
protect your secret?

46:05.480 --> 46:06.880
How about you, Astor?

46:08.320 --> 46:10.600
We know the gun used to kill Sian belonged to you.

46:10.640 --> 46:14.680
We also know that Sian caught you in a rather

46:10.640 --> 46:14.680
compromising position.

46:14.720 --> 46:16.720
Perhaps you were worried she would talk.

46:18.120 --> 46:19.840
Or was it you, Leo?

46:19.880 --> 46:22.280
You'd been rejected by Sian but were too proud

46:19.880 --> 46:22.280
to accept it.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.240
-No, I loved her.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.840
GRIFF: Don't say that.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.480
You don't get to say that.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.160
Or you, Griff, the boyfriend.

46:33.120 --> 46:37.440
The sensible, loving boyfriend.

46:37.480 --> 46:40.800
Perhaps you discovered that the love of

46:37.480 --> 46:40.800
your life had, um...

46:41.440 --> 46:42.560
Strayed?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.680
No.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.440
Quite right. It's impossible, isn't it?

46:48.480 --> 46:50.560
It's impossible that anyone here

46:50.600 --> 46:52.240
could've murdered Sian.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.200
She was found slumped flush against

46:52.280 --> 46:55.200
the shower room door,

46:55.240 --> 46:56.400
gun in hand.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.400
The killer had no way in and no way out.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.240
It would have been quite impossible

46:58.440 --> 47:01.240
for someone to shoot her

47:01.280 --> 47:03.560
and then escape, and all in a matter of seconds

47:03.600 --> 47:05.080
after the gunshot was heard.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.760
Unless the gunshot you heard

47:09.000 --> 47:12.320
was not the shot that killed her.

47:12.360 --> 47:14.440
Now, on the morning of her murder,

47:14.480 --> 47:18.120
Sian went into the shower room with every intention of...

47:18.760 --> 47:20.240
showering.

47:20.280 --> 47:23.160
There was no premeditated plan to take her own life.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.400
Which means that someone else came into the shower room.

47:26.440 --> 47:29.880
<i>Now, 7:45 am,</i> <i>Sian collected her things</i>

47:29.920 --> 47:31.000
<i>and headed to the shower.</i>

47:31.040 --> 47:32.560
<i>She entered the shower room,</i> <i>placed her towel on the rack,</i>

47:34.160 --> 47:36.880
<i>and began to</i> <i>unpack her toiletries.</i>

47:38.040 --> 47:39.360
So far so good.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.440
But then...

47:44.040 --> 47:47.960
It was the person who was poised to kill her

47:44.040 --> 47:47.960
in cold blood.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.720
And herein lies the question

47:50.760 --> 47:53.800
that leads to the answer that unlocks the truth.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.440
Sian let the killer into the shower room

47:56.480 --> 47:58.560
of her own accord.

47:59.480 --> 48:00.680
So who,

48:00.720 --> 48:02.680
out of the four of you,

48:03.400 --> 48:06.120
would Sian allow in?

48:07.720 --> 48:09.280
-You.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.560
You killed Sian.

48:11.720 --> 48:13.200
<i>You entered,</i>

48:13.240 --> 48:14.600
<i>raised the pillow to</i> <i>her chest to muffle the bang</i>

48:14.640 --> 48:16.440
<i></i>

48:16.480 --> 48:19.600
All with astonishing and brutal efficiency. JP?

48:25.240 --> 48:26.400
I spy

48:27.000 --> 48:28.560
with my little eye

48:29.240 --> 48:30.400
a killer.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.640
And I'll wager you didn't have sufficient time to dispose

48:36.680 --> 48:37.840
of said pillow.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.320
A mistake, certainly.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.360
But you were clever too.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.200
Throwing us off the scent.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.960
Because you knew Sian had a history of depression.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.880
She was scared about heading off to uni.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.960
I mean, she could get like that in her head.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.040
A fact you'd assumed we'd uncover during

48:50.000 --> 48:53.040
our investigation.

48:53.080 --> 48:57.480
Apparently Sian had suffered from anxiety and

48:53.080 --> 48:57.480
depression during her exams.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.040
So, you staged her suicide,

48:59.080 --> 49:01.800
knowing we'd assume Sian was suffering once more

49:01.840 --> 49:03.800
from anxiety and depression.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.000
To stage the scene,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.480
you needed time.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.400
<i>As we know,</i>

49:11.440 --> 49:13.880
<i>you went for a run at 7:45.</i>

49:13.920 --> 49:15.680
<i>Except you didn't,</i> <i>did you, Griff?</i>

49:17.880 --> 49:20.120
Because you headed straight for Astor's office

49:20.160 --> 49:21.760
to retrieve his gun.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.040
GRIFF: Wait a minute. I didn't even know

49:21.800 --> 49:24.040
he had a gun.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.600
How would I know where to find it?

49:25.640 --> 49:27.480
Oh, you knew he had a gun, all right.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.400
And I think you knew exactly where to find it.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.240
<i>'Cause when you went</i> <i>to confront Astor</i>

49:32.280 --> 49:34.720
<i>the previous night</i> <i>about the drugs</i>

49:32.280 --> 49:34.720
<i>he'd given to Sian,</i>

49:34.760 --> 49:37.720
<i>you started to look for</i> <i>evidence of his dealing.</i>

49:34.760 --> 49:37.720
<i>You said so yourself.</i>

49:37.760 --> 49:40.760
<i>And I think that's where you</i> <i>came across Astor's gun.</i>

49:43.000 --> 49:44.720
So, the next morning,

49:44.760 --> 49:46.720
all you had to do was just nip back in

49:47.480 --> 49:48.640
and grab it.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.440
And then you made your way over to the shower room,

49:59.160 --> 50:00.280
and you killed Sian.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.040
And once you'd done it

50:02.080 --> 50:05.120
you staged the scene to look like suicide

50:02.080 --> 50:05.120
rather than murder.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.600
With Sian slumped

50:06.640 --> 50:08.280
against the door on one side of the room

50:08.320 --> 50:10.600
and a slatted window sealed on the other side,

50:10.640 --> 50:13.240
how on earth could any killer have got out of there?

50:17.280 --> 50:18.720
So, how did you do it?

50:20.160 --> 50:22.520
Oh, if you'll indulge me...

50:24.560 --> 50:25.720
Thank you.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.360
Bingo.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.640
Once he shot Sian,

50:49.680 --> 50:52.000
Griff positioned the towel underneath the door.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.440
Half in the corridor. Half in the shower room.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.440
He then moved the body onto the towel.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.280
<i>Wiped the gun for</i> <i>prints and place it</i>

50:56.480 --> 50:59.280
<i>into Sian's hand.</i>

50:59.320 --> 51:01.000
<i>He then scooped up the pillow.</i>

51:01.040 --> 51:03.640
Left the shower room, closing the shower

51:01.040 --> 51:03.640
room door behind him

51:03.680 --> 51:05.240
and pulling the towel.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.080
<i>Which in turn</i> <i>pulled Sian's body</i>

51:08.120 --> 51:09.800
<i>flush against the door.</i>

51:11.960 --> 51:13.680
Back in the dorm room,

51:13.720 --> 51:17.000
Griff neatly folded her towel and placed it

51:13.720 --> 51:17.000
back onto her bed

51:17.040 --> 51:18.680
before replacing the pillow.

51:20.080 --> 51:23.000
The stage was set. Suicide.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.280
But to give himself an alibi,

51:27.240 --> 51:29.520
Griff needed another gunshot.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.960
A second gunshot.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.160
You all heard it.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.600
-RECORDING:<i> Yee-haw!</i> -Oh, sorry.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.800
Not that one.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.800
And there you have it.

51:57.840 --> 52:01.720
The gunshot you heard was nothing more

51:57.840 --> 52:01.720
than a sound effect.

52:03.440 --> 52:07.280
<i>Griff attached</i> <i>his mobile phone</i>

52:03.440 --> 52:07.280
<i>to the speaker system.</i>

52:07.320 --> 52:09.480
<i>Set the timer for</i> <i>the gunshot sound.</i>

52:10.560 --> 52:12.560
<i>And then he headed out</i> <i>on his run.</i>

52:13.880 --> 52:15.720
Now granted, uh,

52:15.760 --> 52:18.880
I didn't really have any idea how I managed to

52:15.760 --> 52:18.880
change my e-mail alert.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.560
Uh, but it made me realise

52:20.600 --> 52:22.800
that a gunshot effect could be created in much the same way,

52:22.840 --> 52:24.600
then played through a speaker.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.360
Not beyond the capability of Griff,

52:27.400 --> 52:29.600
who we know worked as a sometime DJ

52:29.640 --> 52:31.560
in a pub back home.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.840
HUMPHREY: <i>And that was the gunshot</i>

52:33.240 --> 52:35.840
<i>that alerted you.</i>

52:35.880 --> 52:37.920
-HUMPHREY:

52:35.880 --> 52:37.920
<i>The gunshot that was set</i>

52:37.960 --> 52:39.240
<i>to deceive.</i>

52:39.280 --> 52:41.560
The loud bang, the body, the blood.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.680
The only conclusion to draw

52:43.720 --> 52:46.840
is that the noise you all heard

52:43.720 --> 52:46.840
was a real gunshot

52:46.880 --> 52:49.840
and it came from the direction of the shower room.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.200
All Griff then had to do

52:53.240 --> 52:54.640
was lay in wait.

52:56.680 --> 52:59.280
-HUMPHREY:<i> Upon his return,</i>

52:59.320 --> 53:01.040
<i>Griff retrieved his mobile</i>

53:01.080 --> 53:04.320
<i>and emerged when</i> <i>he spied Astor break</i>

53:01.080 --> 53:04.320
<i>through the shutters.</i>

53:04.360 --> 53:06.320
Risky, you might say,

53:07.160 --> 53:08.960
leaving Sian's body alone,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.120
undiscovered while he went out running.

53:13.480 --> 53:16.040
Anyone could've walked in.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.200
Except Griff knew that everyone would either be

53:18.240 --> 53:20.160
at breakfast or on the boat trip.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.280
He also knew

53:21.320 --> 53:23.360
that Astor cleaned the dorm room

53:23.400 --> 53:25.080
at 8:00 am each morning.

53:25.680 --> 53:26.800
So he timed it,

53:26.840 --> 53:29.000
knowing he had just under 10 minutes

53:29.040 --> 53:31.680
to get out of the bathroom, up to the water seller,

53:31.720 --> 53:32.920
before the gunshot.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.400
Why would I kill her? I loved her.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.560
I know you did.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.760
Trouble was, Griff...

53:42.560 --> 53:44.600
You loved her too much.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.320
See, it was something Leo said

53:46.360 --> 53:47.920
that got me thinking.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.640
She said he could be like that, controlling.

53:50.680 --> 53:52.120
That's what this is all about.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.200
Love. Obsession.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.080
Control.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.280
You controlled the purse strings.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.880
I was looking after all the money.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.400
You controlled where she went. Who she went with.

54:08.440 --> 54:09.680
I didn't want her to go.

54:09.720 --> 54:12.120
No wonder she ran off with Leo for a week.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.920
She was running away from you.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.240
See, I think that's why Sian acquired those drugs,

54:17.280 --> 54:19.280
because she needed an escape.

54:19.320 --> 54:23.240
She needed an escape from the pressure of this

54:19.320 --> 54:23.240
claustrophobic relationship.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.360
She wanted a night of fun.

54:25.400 --> 54:28.760
The truth was things were changing, Griff.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.280
Sian was spreading her wings.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.440
About to go to university.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.800
Her whole life just about to start.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.680
And not just any university either,

54:34.720 --> 54:36.200
Edinburgh.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.280
About as far away from you as she could possibly get.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.400
She'd outgrown you.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.080
-No. -HUMPHREY: Yes.

54:41.120 --> 54:44.000
And what else do controlling and possessive boyfriends do?

54:44.040 --> 54:45.560
They read their partners' text messages.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.560
And that's when you realised what had gone on

54:47.600 --> 54:49.240
the week you and Sian were separated.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.960
She had betrayed you.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.840
Which added insult to injury.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.600
Officer Myers?

55:00.640 --> 55:03.800
We came across these photos on your social media,

55:03.840 --> 55:06.320
and your necklace is indeed

55:06.360 --> 55:09.640
the Thai symbol for love, but it wasn't yours.

55:09.680 --> 55:12.480
It belonged to Sian. I think you bought it for her.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.480
You see, Sian's wearing the necklace.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.280
The same one you're wearing now.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.360
'Cause the night before she died

55:19.400 --> 55:23.000
you were not, as you previously stated,

55:19.400 --> 55:23.000
"Comforting her".

55:23.040 --> 55:25.480
<i>I think she ended</i> <i>things with you,</i>

55:25.520 --> 55:29.040
<i>and she gave you back</i> <i>the necklace you bought her.</i>

55:29.080 --> 55:31.200
<i>And that's when you</i> <i>realised you'd lost her.</i>

55:31.240 --> 55:33.400
And not just for the week this time, for good.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.800
But if you couldn't have her,

55:35.840 --> 55:37.520
nobody else could.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.080
And you would have got away with it.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.640
But for one mistake.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.120
<i>The washbag.</i>

55:45.080 --> 55:46.440
That's how we knew

55:46.480 --> 55:48.640
Sian hadn't entered into the shower room

55:48.680 --> 55:50.880
with the intention of ending her own life.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.200
You killed her.

55:53.920 --> 55:55.080
Take him away.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.360
I am so sorry.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.200
I suppose I should get used to this.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.320
Oh, young love, eh?

56:24.000 --> 56:25.920
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

56:25.960 --> 56:27.840
<i>please, could you</i> <i>make some room?</i>

56:27.880 --> 56:29.200
<i>I give to you</i>

56:30.560 --> 56:32.240
<i>Mr and Mrs Hooper.</i>

57:01.760 --> 57:03.040
Humphrey?

57:03.080 --> 57:05.160
What are you doing? You just stepped out.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.080
Yes, um, sorry.

57:07.600 --> 57:08.760
Are you OK? Yes.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.840
What are you doing here?

57:12.880 --> 57:14.520
Trying to kill you, evidently.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.120
Touche.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.280
I thought you'd left.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.200
Officer Myers tracked me down.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.040
I was literally about to get on the boat.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.960
He explained about what happened last night.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.680
About how you talked the groom down from

57:25.000 --> 57:28.680
a metaphorical cliff.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.760
Dwayne used the word metaphorical?

57:30.800 --> 57:32.040
No, I'm paraphrasing.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.920
Oh.

57:33.960 --> 57:36.560
So I thought perhaps we could get that drink after all.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.960
Yes, fantastic.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.280
It's a free bar, too.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.640
-Beer would be...

57:43.680 --> 57:45.200
-Marv.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.800
OK, two beers coming up.
