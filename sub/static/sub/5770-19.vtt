00:42.303 --> 00:44.435
THEY'VE GOT ALL-TERRAIN
WHEELS ON THEM

WE'LL SEE IF IT TURNS INTO
SOMETHING WEIRD, OKAY?

01:31.047 --> 01:33.310
THAT'S A VERY
SEXY THING TO SAY.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.095
IF OTHER PEOPLE WANNA

STUPID BROOKLYN.

[upbeat music]

01:54.810 --> 02:02.905
â™ª

02:06.169 --> 02:08.824
GUYS, I MET A HOT STRANGER
ON THE SUBWAY,

02:08.867 --> 02:10.608
AND HE DID NOT TRY
TO KILL ME.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.741
IN FACT, HE WAS HANDSOME.
AND GET THIS--

02:12.784 --> 02:14.830
HE WAS SENDING BOXES
TO HAITI.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.919
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT BOXES
ARE FUN TO PLAY IN,

02:16.962 --> 02:19.226
BUT PEOPLE IN HAITI
NEED SUPPLIES.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.053
SOUNDS BETTER THAN
YOUR LAST COUPLE GUYS.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.533
I GUESS THAT WE'LL JUST WAIT
FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.666
DARK-SECRET-WISE.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.058
OKAY, MR. CYNICAL.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.104
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU
THAT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE

02:28.148 --> 02:30.411
A PERSON EXISTS WHO DOES
GOOD FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.065
HEY, I'M GOING TO THE PRACTICE
VOLUNTEER TRIP NEXT WEEK.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.458
IN FACT, MINDY,
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

02:34.502 --> 02:36.199
WHO CURRENTLY ISN'T GOING.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.071
UGH. A WOMEN'S PRISON?
YOU GUYS, COME ON.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.334
IF I WANTED TO GET SHANKED,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.162
I'D JUST SHAVE MY LEGS
DRUNK AGAIN--AM I RIGHT?

02:42.205 --> 02:45.034
MINDY, THE AMERICAN PRISON
SYSTEM IS A BLEMISH

02:45.077 --> 02:46.992
ON AN OTHERWISE
BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.559
THE LEAST WE CAN DO
IS OFFER

02:48.603 --> 02:50.082
THESE POOR SOULS
FREE HEALTH CARE.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.259
I AM CHIPPING IN
FOR THE VAN, AM I NOT?

02:52.302 --> 02:54.870
AND THAT IS A VERY
GENEROUS CONTRIBUTION.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.437
THIS IS LIKE
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.960
WOULD YOU PREFER SOMEONE
WHO HAS NEVER

02:58.003 --> 02:59.179
PICKED UP A HAMMER BEFORE,

02:59.222 --> 03:00.223
OR WOULD YOU PREFER A CHECK

03:00.267 --> 03:02.791
TO BUY AS MANY HAMMERS
AS YOU WANT?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.358
SO NO ONE IS HAMMERING
IN YOUR SCENARIO.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.360
MINDY, THESE INMATES,
THEY NEED OUR HELP.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.839
THEY'RE MOSTLY GOOD PEOPLE.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.232
THAT IS TRUE.
THEY MAINLY ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.147
BUT AS AN EX-CON,
LET ME TELL YOU,

03:11.191 --> 03:14.585
THEY ARE MOSTLY
DEAD-EYED CREEPS AND SAVAGES.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.673
MORGAN MAKES A GREAT POINT.

03:15.717 --> 03:19.155
SEE? YOU ARE
THE TALLEST MAN

THANK YOU.
I DATED A GUY ONCE
THAT WAS 5'1".

I RODE A CREW.
REALLY?

03:25.335 --> 03:26.641
I RODE WITH
THE WINKLEVOSS TWINS.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.121
THEY CALLED US
THE WINKLEVOSS TRIPLETS.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.601
THIS IS A REALLY NICE DATE.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.125
YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE
USED TO BE A SPEAKEASY.REALLY?

03:33.169 --> 03:35.215
UH-HUH, BABE RUTH
WAS SAID TO HAVE THROWN UP

03:35.258 --> 03:36.477
AT THAT BOOTH
OVER THERE.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.130
THAT'S FUNNY THAT YOU
BRING UP BABE RUTH,

03:43.701 --> 03:45.181
I LOVE NEW YORK CITY.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.878
EVERY BUILDING
USED TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.185
FOR INSTANCE, MY APARTMENT USED
TO BE A TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.186
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.579
MYAPARTMENT BUILDING

03:51.622 --> 03:54.016

I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD
BE A WALKING TOUR

03:57.019 --> 03:59.021

04:27.658 --> 04:29.051

04:29.094 --> 04:30.531
I DO. YEAH.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.241
HE'S A PRIEST.A CATHOLIC PRIEST?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.025
YOU SHOULD FEEL WEIRD,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HELL.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.200
NO, HE'S LUTHERAN.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.201
WELL, THAT JUST MAKES HIM
A MINISTER.

I'M A PRETTY SERIOUS CATHOLIC.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.692

07:04.032 --> 07:05.381
THIS IS THE COOLEST PARTY
I'VE EVER GONE TO.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.382
IT'S NOT A PARTY.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.383
MOBY.

07:07.427 --> 07:13.084
[cheers and applause]

07:13.128 --> 07:15.260
COME ON.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.001
THIS IS GREAT.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.221
I LOVE EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU. THANK YOU.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.528
I'M EXCITED FOR TODAY.
I'VE GOT A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.920
I HOPE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.487
I WILL BE SO EMBARRASSED.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.967
I HATE GOD.

07:26.010 --> 07:26.968
[all gasping]

07:27.011 --> 07:29.100
OH, MAN.
WE'RE ALL DEAD.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.101
[Casey]
AND HERE'S WHY.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.189
HAD A LONG DAY AT THE OFFICE.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.191
GOT HOME, I WAS EXHAUSTED.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.150
YOU KNOW, I KICK OFF
MY DRESS SHOES, PUT ON MY UGGS.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.239
THANK YOU, MOBY.
APPRECIATE THOSE.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.588
WHAT I WANT TO DO--

07:38.632 --> 07:41.156
WATCH A LITTLE GAME OF THRONES
ON THE DVR.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.027
TURNS OUT--WASN'T RECORDED.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.464
I LOOK UP AT THE BIG MAN,
I GO,

07:44.507 --> 07:46.030
"WHAT'S UP WITH THAT, G?"

07:46.074 --> 07:48.032
THAT'S WHY I HATE GOD.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.730
AND I WANT EVERYONE HERE
TO SAY IT WITH ME.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.035
I HATE GOD?

07:51.079 --> 07:52.602
SHE HATES GOD.
WHO ELSE HATES GOD?

07:52.646 --> 07:54.212
[all]
I HATE GOD!

07:54.256 --> 07:55.779
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT ON BOARD WITH THIS.

07:55.823 --> 07:56.824
I HATE GOD.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.434
[all]
I HATE GOD.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.001
OKAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.482
WE ALL HATE GOD,
AND HE HEARS YOUR ANGER.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.526
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:03.570 --> 08:06.398
GOD STILL LOVES YOU ANYWAY.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.226
[murmuring] OH, YES, YES!

08:08.270 --> 08:09.445
THAT WAS AMAZING.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.577
[woman]
AMEN.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.100
SOMETHING'S BEEN
BUGGING ME TODAY.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.581
NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.SHH.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.930
I SEE A BUNCH
OF WEEKEND WARRIORS.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.584
I'M NOT SEEING YOU GUYS
HERE DURING THE WEEK.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.282
GUYS, GOD IS WITH YOU
24/7.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.458
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING
YOU KNOW WHAT.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.808
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
TO BE SOME RELIGIOUS FREAK.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.594
IF I WANT TO GO TO BONNAROO
AND SEE THE BLACK KEYS,

08:27.637 --> 08:28.812
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WANT TO GO TO HELL.

08:28.856 --> 08:29.944
I JUST WANT TO ROCK!

08:29.987 --> 08:31.598
LET GOD IN.
HE'S COOL.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.078
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
LIKE BRUNO MARS SINGS.

08:34.122 --> 08:38.169
â™ª I NEVER HAD MUCH FAITH
IN LOVE â™ª

08:38.213 --> 08:40.215
â™ª OR MIRACLES

08:40.258 --> 08:43.044
â™ª NEVER BEEN ONE TO PUT

08:43.087 --> 08:46.177
â™ª MY HEART ON THE LINE

08:46.221 --> 08:48.005
[music amps up]

08:48.049 --> 08:49.572
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:49.616 --> 08:54.577
â™ª BUT SWIMMING IN YOUR WATER'S
SOMETHING SPIRIT-U-AL â™ª

08:54.621 --> 08:56.579
â™ª

08:56.623 --> 09:00.931
â™ª I'M BORN AGAIN EVERY TIME
YOU SPEND THE NI-I-IGHT â™ª

09:00.975 --> 09:02.933
[vocalizes]

09:02.977 --> 09:04.326
[cheers and applause]

09:04.369 --> 09:07.590
I'M TOTALLY GONNA
NAIL PASTOR CASEY.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.026
JUST MOVE IT.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT, LADIES.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.071
I'M SORRY. HEY, GUYS. SORRY,
I'M JUST--I'M KIND OF--

09:10.114 --> 09:11.942
HE'S ALREADY TAKEN, SO--

09:11.986 --> 09:13.857
HEY, CASEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.903
GIVE ME A HUG.

09:15.946 --> 09:16.904
WHOA.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.253
GREAT SEEING YOU.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.690
THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

09:20.734 --> 09:21.865
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.171
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.825
NO, I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD, YOU KNOW.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.522
AND, ACTUALLY,
I BROUGHT A FRIEND.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.698
DANNY, WHAT DO YOU DOING?
COME HERE.WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:28.742 --> 09:31.005
CAN YOU TELL CASEY HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED THE SERVICE?

09:31.048 --> 09:33.703
PASTOR,
IT WAS--IT WAS NICE.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.792
A LITTLE TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL
FOR ME.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.272
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE.
IT WAS NICE.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.056
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
IN FRONT OF A CHURCH.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.450
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.843
I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM.
HIS WIFE LEFT HIM.

09:42.886 --> 09:47.021
GOD'S WITH HIM.AND I JUST WANT
TO TELL YOU...

09:47.064 --> 09:48.196
WHAT'S UP?

09:48.239 --> 09:51.503
I REALLY WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.504
OKAY.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.505
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING,

09:53.549 --> 09:55.638
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE--SURE.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.813
I'M, LIKE,
JUST SO FEELING IT.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.598
YEAH.JUST I DON'T CARE

09:58.641 --> 09:59.860
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.079
YOU CAN DEAL WITH
GROSS LEPERS ALL DAY LONG,

10:02.123 --> 10:05.300
LOOK, MINDY,
I HAD A GREAT TIME ON OUR DATE.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.041
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.ME TOO.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.172
OKAY, IT WAS FUN.
YOU'RE COOL.

10:08.216 --> 10:11.436
AND I AM ACTUALLY
VERY ATTRACTED TO YOU

10:11.480 --> 10:14.701
IN LIKE A REALLY INTERESTING
AND VISCERAL WAY.

10:14.744 --> 10:15.919
OKAY, I AM SO FEELING THAT.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.313
BUT HERE'S THE--
HERE'S THE--HERE'S THE DEAL.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.794
THE DRIVING FORCE IN MY LIFE
IS SELFLESSNESS.

10:20.837 --> 10:21.795
SELFISHNESS?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.535
SELFLESSNESS.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.060
AND I JUST DON'T GET
THE SENSE THAT IT'S YOURS.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.236
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A GOOD PERSON?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.455
NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, IT WAS ONE DATE.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.935
JUST, YOU DIDN'T SEEM
TOO INTERESTED

10:31.979 --> 10:34.242
IN THE MISSION
WE'RE WORKING ON IN HAITI.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.852
YOU ONLY LIT UP WHEN
I TALKED ABOUT MEETING WYCLEF.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.550
NO, WHEN YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR EMAIL EXCHANGE

10:38.594 --> 10:40.422
WITH SEAN PENN, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.250
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.861
IT'S JUST I HOLD MYSELF
TO AN IMPOSSIBLY HIGH STANDARD.

10:44.905 --> 10:48.996
I DON'T WANT THAT TO MAKE
YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.345
YOU KNOW.YEAH.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.956
OKAY, YEAH.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.480
YOU JUST DON'T THINK
I'M A GOOD PERSON.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.874
IT'LL TAKE TWO HOURS
TO GET TO THE PRISON.

10:57.918 --> 10:58.962
WE SHOULD START LOADING
THE VAN.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.965
WHY ARE THERE PICTURES
OF YOU IN THERE?

11:02.009 --> 11:03.358
WELL, THE WOMEN ALWAYS ASK.

11:03.401 --> 11:06.013
IT SEEMS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL
PUNISHMENT TO DENY THEM.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.971
EVERYONE, I AM READY
TO GO TO PRISON,

11:08.015 --> 11:09.930
BECAUSE I AM A GOOD PERSON.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.409
ACTUALLY, WE SHOULD ALL GO.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.889
OKAY, YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE
THAT ARE ALREADY GOING.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.935
YES, DANNY,
I AM PREACHING TO THE CHOIR,

11:14.978 --> 11:15.936
WHICH IS UNIQUELY CHALLENGING

11:15.979 --> 11:17.154
BECAUSE OFTEN THEY ARE SINGING

11:17.198 --> 11:18.155
AND THEY CANNOT HEAR YOU.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.156
WHAT'S ON YOUR KEY CHAIN?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.767
THIS IS PEPPER SPRAY.

11:20.810 --> 11:21.768
SO IF EVERYONE TRIES ANYTHING
I'LL BE LIKE,

11:21.811 --> 11:22.943
"PEW, PEW, PEPPER SPRAY."

11:22.986 --> 11:24.379
IF YOU GET CLOSE ENOUGH
TO THESE MANIACS

11:24.422 --> 11:26.424
TO USE PEPPER SPRAY,
THAT MEANS YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.774
HEY, LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.608
[Mindy]
WOW, VOLUNTEERING
JUST FEELS SO GOOD.

11:36.652 --> 11:37.827
WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.350
ALL WE DID WAS GET
BREAKFAST SANDWICHES.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.656
MINDY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THIS.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.484
IF THERE'S AN OUTLET MALL
NEAR THE PRISON.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.007
WE CAN DROP YOU THERE.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.575
ACCORDING TO THE BILLBOARD,
IT'S A REAL OASIS OF SAVINGS.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.924
GUYS, WHAT IS
THIS CRAZY PERCEPTION

11:47.968 --> 11:50.361
THAT I AM NOT ALTRUISTIC?
IT'S NUTS.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.147
AND AS JESUS SAID,
IF YOU WANT--WAIT, YOU CAN'T QUOTE JESUS.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.845
YOU'VE BEEN TO CHURCH ONCE.
HE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.673
BETSY,
QUIT SQUIRMING.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.849
OUR BONES
ARE GRINDING.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.546
[honks horn]
PAY ATTENTION, PLEASE.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.765
GOT A LOT TO GO OVER

12:02.809 --> 12:04.724
BEFORE WE GET TO
THE LADY JOINT, ALL RIGHT?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.508
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT
THESE ARE PRISONERS

12:06.551 --> 12:08.684
THAT HAVE BEEN JUDGED
AS SCUM.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.382
AND THEY ARE DESPERATE
PEOPLE, OKAY?

12:11.426 --> 12:13.645
DR. L, I GOT THIS NEWSBOY CAP.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.299
I WANT YOU TO TUCK
YOUR HAIR INTO IT.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.344
YOU GOTTA "BOY" UP.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.432
NO, I'M NOT LOOKING
LIKE AN ORPHAN.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.433
TAKE IT BACK.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.521
DR. REED, DR. CASTELLANO,

HOW TO TAPE YOUR JUNK DOWN.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.137
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.443
ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD JUST DRESS
LIKE A WOMAN, DR. REED.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.532
JUST RIGHT AWAY TO BE SAFE.NO, MORGAN.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.186
BETSY, IF YOU SHOW FEAR,

12:32.229 --> 12:33.404
THEY WILL
LITERALLY EAT YOU.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.666
OTHER RULES:

12:34.710 --> 12:36.451
DON'T VOLUNTEER

12:36.494 --> 12:37.669
DR. LAHIRI...

12:37.713 --> 12:39.802
I HEARD YOU.TO MAKE SURE...

12:39.846 --> 12:42.109
I HAVE CREATED ALIASES
FOR ALL OF US.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.676
DR. C,
YOU'RE GONNA BE EDWARD WONG.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.028
HE IS A CHINESE-AMERICAN
ATTORNEY IN PALO AL--

12:48.071 --> 12:49.551
WHO THREW IT?

12:49.594 --> 12:50.987
[shouts]
WHO THREW IT?

12:51.988 --> 12:53.163
[Mindy]
OH, GOD.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.861
DANNY, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.166
I FEEL REALLY TRAPPED
IN HERE.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.864
IT'S A PRISON.
THAT'S ON PURPOSE.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.735
I DO NOT LIKE THE WAY
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT ME.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.345
I CAN TELL THAT
THEY RESENT MY FREEDOM.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.347
YOU WANT TO WAIT IN THE VAN?
I'LL CRACK A WINDOW.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.827
I HAVE TO DO THIS.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.743
I LIKE YOUR HAIR.KEEP WALKING. KEEP WALKING.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
THOSE WHO DO NOT FOLLOW
MORGAN'S RULES

13:09.440 --> 13:10.702
ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT THEM.

13:10.746 --> 13:14.576
AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.708
I RECOGNIZE
LOTS OF OLD FACES.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.841
DONNA, I LOVE YOUR HAIRDO.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.756
FOR THOSE OF YOU BEGINNING
YOUR "STRETCH,"

13:20.800 --> 13:22.366

LADIES!

AND I USE
THAT TERM LOOSELY.

13:34.770 --> 13:38.469
I WANT THREE EQUAL LINES.
HERE, HERE, AND HERE.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.470
COME ON!
[Jeremy]
MORGAN.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.732
LET THEM CHOOSE.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.343
THEY HAVE SUCH LITTLE CHOICE
IN THEIR LIVES.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.911
NO, NOT ONLY ARE YOU MAKING
THESE TWO DOCTORS

13:44.954 --> 13:46.695
FEEL LIKE LOSERS...

13:46.738 --> 13:47.870
WHAT?
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE A LOSER.

13:47.914 --> 13:48.871
WHICH THEY ARE NOT.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.612
THEY ARE RICH, THEY ARE HOT.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.702
THEY ARE NOT IN JAIL,
UNLIKE YOU!

13:53.745 --> 13:55.747
MOVE!
BREAK IT UP NOW.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.836
THREE.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.272
NO, MORGAN.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.448
NOW ALL THE SCARY-LOOKING ONES
ARE COMING TO MY LINE.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.189
THAT WOMAN
HAS TWO WANDERING EYES.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.408
HEY, GUYS.
CAN I TRADE YOU,

14:04.452 --> 14:06.323
BECAUSE THAT ONE WOMAN
JUST ASKED TO BUY MY PENIS.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.803
THIS IS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.109
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.197
COME FORWARD.
YEAH, LET'S GET--

14:10.240 --> 14:11.589
[Morgan]
NOT FOR SALE.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.764
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THE WORD "PENIS"

14:12.808 --> 14:14.854
COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.074
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

14:18.118 --> 14:19.815
OW! UCK.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.557
OKAY, MA'AM, I CANNOT
GIVE YOU A BREAST EXAM

14:22.600 --> 14:24.080
IF YOU KEEP BITING
AT MY FINGERS.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.690
NEXT.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.214
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
DOING THIS.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.259
I DO NOT KNOW THAT
I WILL BE OF MUCH HELP.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.782
I THINK I NEED
A RABIES SHOT.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.045
COME ON IN.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.266
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

14:36.310 --> 14:38.486
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
AN EMBARRASSING QUESTION.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.401
NO, I WILL NOT PASS
A MESSAGE ON TO SOMEONE

14:40.444 --> 14:41.837
ON THE OUTSIDE.
I WON'T DO IT.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.056
NO, NO.

14:43.099 --> 14:43.839
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
ON REAL HOUSEWIVES?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.668
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:46.711 --> 14:48.278
YEAH,
DO YOU HAVE THREE HOURS?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.237
OF COURSE YOU DO.
YOU'RE IN PRISON.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.500
SUSAN ROBINSON?WHAT?

14:52.543 --> 14:53.936
I MEAN--WHAT?

14:53.980 --> 14:54.981
I DON'T KNOW ANY SUSAN,

14:55.024 --> 14:57.026
AND I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN
TO TUCSON.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.071
MOVE ALONG.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.682
SUSAN, IT'S ME, JUDITH.
WHAT GIVES?

15:00.725 --> 15:01.683
HEY, YOU HEARD HER,
JUDITH.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.685
"HEY"?SCRAM, JUDITH.

15:05.992 --> 15:06.949
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO DO THAT.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.909
I WANTED TO.
I LIKED IT.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.781
YOU'RE REALLY NICE.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.435
REALLY?YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.654
YOU'RE A FANCY DOCTOR,
AND YOU'RE TAKING

15:16.698 --> 15:18.352
ALL THIS TIME
TO TALK TO ME.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.703
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS SAVING THIS AS A REWARD

15:21.746 --> 15:24.793
FOR MY RIDE HOME,
BUT I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.360
WOW.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.710
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE GAVE ME A PRESENT.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.887
UM, WELL, I-I-I DON'T KNOW

15:31.931 --> 15:34.107
IF YOU'D HAVE USE FOR THIS,
BUT DO YOU WANT MY PASHMINA?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.065
OH, THANK YOU.YEAH?

15:36.109 --> 15:38.938
I'D GIVE YOU MY BELT,
BUT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

15:38.981 --> 15:41.244
YOU'D USE IT TO HANG YOURSELF,
SO I'M GONNA HOLD ONTO THAT.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.768
DO YOU HAVE ANY OLD KEYS
I COULD SHARPEN?

15:43.812 --> 15:45.205
UH...

15:45.248 --> 15:47.598
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE PEOPLE
LIKE US FIGHTING FOR YOU,

15:47.642 --> 15:48.904
YOU'RE NOT FORGOTTEN.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.906
TAKE A PHOTO.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.213
I JUST MET THE FIRST
FEMALE CASINO ROBBER.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.823
SAID SHE BROKE
THE GLASS CEILING.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.999
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT SET OFF
THE ALARM.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.218
[Mindy]
ALL RIGHT, LIZZY,
IT WAS GREAT MEETING YOU.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.480
TAKE CARE, OKAY?

15:59.523 --> 16:02.657
AND I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET OUT.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.963
WHAT?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.138
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D SPEND
THE WHOLE DAY

16:05.181 --> 16:06.487
HITTING ON THE GUY
IN THE WATCH TOWER.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.315
NO, I WAS TOO BUSY
TOUCHING LIVES.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.187
AS IT TURNS OUT,
I AM EXTREMELY ALTRUISTIC.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.972
GREAT. MAYBE NEXT
YOU'LL WORK ON HUMILITY.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.235
[Mindy]
NO NEED.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.236
I WANT CANDY!

16:16.279 --> 16:17.672
NO, I DROPPED THAT!

16:19.108 --> 16:20.457
NO. NO, NO.
I GAVE THAT TO LIZZY.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.632
MINDY, NO.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.677
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.765
OKAY, EVERYONE CALM DOWN.
HEY.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.810
I DID NOT
GIVE THAT TO YOU!

16:25.854 --> 16:27.421
[alarm blaring] I WANT IT!

16:27.464 --> 16:28.988
[Morgan]
YOU'RE A SURGEON.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.424
YOU'VE GOT DELICATE HANDS.GET OUT OF HERE!

16:30.467 --> 16:31.512
DO NOT ENTER
A HOT ZONE.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.817
DO NOT ENTER A HOT ZONE.HEY, STOP!

16:32.861 --> 16:33.818
[Mindy]
IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU!

16:33.862 --> 16:35.820
STOP--STOP THAT!

16:35.864 --> 16:37.039
STOP IT!

16:37.083 --> 16:38.214
STOP IT, I TOLD YOU--

16:38.258 --> 16:41.000
I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.176
[maniacal laugh]

16:43.219 --> 16:44.916
[screams]

16:44.960 --> 16:46.222
GUARDS! GAS THEM!

16:48.833 --> 16:49.791
IF YOU ASK ME, THESE CRIMINALS HAVE IT TOO EASY.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.835
I WOULD PUT THEM
IN A BOX,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.446
THROW SOME SCORPIONS
IN THE BOX,

16:52.489 --> 16:54.752
CLOSE THE BOX,
WALK AWAY.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.058
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.668
I USED TO HAVE HAIR
HERE.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.235
I THINK WE ALL
LEARNED A LESSON TODAY.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.542
EVEN THOUGH I CAN
BENCH-PRESS 200 POUNDS,

17:01.585 --> 17:03.370
A BIG WOMAN
SITS ON MY CHEST--

17:03.413 --> 17:05.024
LIGHTS OUT.

17:05.067 --> 17:05.981
DANNY?
YEAH?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.504
I AM SO
EMBARRASSED.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.984
I BASICALLY
STARTED A PRISON RIOT

17:09.028 --> 17:11.073
SO I COULD PROVE TO EVERYONE
HOW ALTRUISTIC I AM.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.989
YEAH, YOU DID IT
TO IMPRESS THAT PASTOR CASEY.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.776
YEAH.ISN'T THAT THE STUPIDEST THING
YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

17:18.820 --> 17:19.734
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S OKAY.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.388
CHRISTIANS ONLY DO
CHARITY WORK

17:21.431 --> 17:23.433
TO IMPRESS GOD.
HE'S A GUY.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.696
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICSAYS
THAT GOD COULD BE A WOMAN.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.568
I'M TRYING REALLY HARD
TO BE BENEVOLENT RIGHT NOW.

17:27.611 --> 17:28.569
YEAH.
THE POINT IS,

17:28.612 --> 17:29.874
YOU HELPED
OTHER PEOPLE TODAY.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.225
FOR ONE SECOND IT FELT GOOD,
AND NOW I REGRET IT.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.574
AND I BASICALLY
GOT SCALPED.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.923
THANK GOD YOU'RE NOT
BACK IN INDIA

17:34.966 --> 17:37.491
WHERE THAT INJURY WOULD
MAKE YOU UNMARRYABLE.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.927
THAT, PLUS YOUR AGE.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.103
[laughs] OW.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.235
SORRY.
DAMN IT!

17:42.278 --> 17:44.063
I'M SORRY.JUST DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH,

17:44.106 --> 17:47.066
A ND FIX MY FACE!DON'T GET RILED UP.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.546
[Morgan]
LET'S REVIEW
WHAT WE LEARNED TODAY.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.679
DR. LAHIRI, I TOLD YOU
TO TUCK YOUR HAIR

17:51.722 --> 17:53.115
INTO A NEWSBOY CAP,
AND YOU SCOFFED AT ME,

17:53.159 --> 17:54.899
AND NOW,
YOU LOOK LIKE A MONSTER.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.467
I AM SORRY THAT I
PEPPER-SPRAYED YOU ACCIDENTALLY,

17:57.511 --> 17:58.468
BUT YOU TACKLED ME!

17:58.512 --> 17:59.600
YEAH, LAY OFF HER.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.254
OKAY, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.864
YOU'RE SHAKIN' YOUR LITTLE HIPS
BACK THERE FOR ALL THE WOMEN,

18:02.907 --> 18:03.865
MAKING 'EM CRAZY.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.127
I WASN'T SHAKING
MY HIPS.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.694
HEY, DR. REED.
GET OFF.

18:06.737 --> 18:09.392
HEY, DO YOU THINK I ENJOY
TAPING MY GENITALS TO MY LEG?

18:09.436 --> 18:10.480
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY I DO IT?

18:10.524 --> 18:11.699
I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:11.742 --> 18:12.874
I WARNED YOU.
HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW?

18:12.917 --> 18:15.746
VIOLATED.
VIOLATED, YES.

18:16.965 --> 18:20.099
HEY, DR. L.
HEY, SLEEPY FACE.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.492
HEY, QUICK QUESTION.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.321
WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
ABOUT ME SAYING,

18:25.365 --> 18:27.889
"DO NOT FEED THE INMATES"?
WAS THAT NOT CLEAR?

18:27.932 --> 18:29.586
WE'VE ALL HAD
A VERY LONG DAY, MORGAN.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.806
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SORRY, I WAS TALKING, OKAY?

18:31.849 --> 18:34.374
BUT I GUESS THAT MEANS
NOTHING TO YOU PEOPLE.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.766
I BET IF I WAS PREGNANT,
YOU'D BE LISTENING

18:35.810 --> 18:37.420
TO EVERY SINGLE WORD
I HAVE TO SAY.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.726
IF YOU WERE PREGNANT,

18:38.769 --> 18:39.683
I THINK WE'D ALL HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.033
OH, HA HA HA HA!

18:42.077 --> 18:45.646
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS DRIVING
KEVIN HART AROUND IN MY MINIVAN!

18:45.689 --> 18:47.735
WHEN IT COMES TO PRISONS,

18:47.778 --> 18:49.780
I AM THE GYNECOLOGIST!

18:49.824 --> 18:53.001
YOU'RE THE NURSES!

18:53.044 --> 18:55.917
OKAY, WE--
WE'RE SORRY,

18:55.960 --> 18:57.701
AND WE KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET,

18:57.745 --> 18:59.616
BUT WE'RE VERY HUNGRY, MORGAN,
AND MAYBE WE COULD

18:59.660 --> 19:00.704
JUST PULL OVER AND GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

19:00.748 --> 19:02.967
CAN WE EAT?
YES.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.709
DO WE DESERVE TO EAT?

19:05.753 --> 19:07.407
NO.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.585
RISHI, WHEN YOU ALMOST DIE,
IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK

19:11.628 --> 19:13.282
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU IN LIFE.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.805
[Rishi]
YOU TALKING ABOUT ME
OR THE BURRITO?

19:14.849 --> 19:16.938
WHY CAN'T IT BE BOTH?

19:16.981 --> 19:19.549
OH, GOD, RISHI, KILL ME. IT'S THAT MINISTER GUY.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.725
NO, NO, NO.
JUST PRETEND WE'RE ON A DATE.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.726
YEAH.
IS HE WALKING BY?

19:22.770 --> 19:23.727
HE'S COMING, JUST-- MINDY?

19:23.771 --> 19:25.164
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

19:25.207 --> 19:26.948
YOU DON'T TALK TO HER,
ALL RIGHT? YOU TALK TO ME.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.906
YOU HURT MY BIG SISTER'S
FEELINGS, AND THEN

19:28.950 --> 19:30.908
SHE WENT AND VOLUNTEERED
AT A WOMEN'S PRISON,

19:30.952 --> 19:32.301
AND THEY
BEAT HER UP GOOD.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.173
LOOK AT HER FACE, MAN.
NO ONE'S GONNA DATE HER NOW.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.783
SHE LOOKS LIKE
MANNY PACQUIAO.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.219
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:37.263 --> 19:38.960
RELAX, IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

19:39.003 --> 19:42.181
WHAT? LOOK, MINDY'S
A REALLY GOOD PERSON, OKAY?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.835
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
I GOT THE CRAP KICKED OUT OF ME

19:44.879 --> 19:46.054
UNTIL MINDY
TOLD THOSE BULLIES

19:46.097 --> 19:48.796
THAT SHE WOULD
CUT THEIR GUTS OUT, OKAY?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.101
THEY STILL CALL YOU
"PSYCHO BITCH."

19:50.145 --> 19:51.625
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
A BAD PERSON TO YOU?

19:51.668 --> 19:52.887
NO.
RISH,

19:52.930 --> 19:54.280
I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

19:54.323 --> 19:56.064
BUT PLEASE DON'T DEFEND ME.
YOU MAKE ME SOUND CRAZY.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.457
SO WHO ARE
THESE CUTE KIDS?

19:57.500 --> 19:59.415
OH, THIS IS JEAN-JEAN
AND JEAN-PIERRE.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.677
[both]
BONJOUR.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.201
THEY'RE MY LITTLE BROTHERS
FROM HAITI,

20:02.244 --> 20:03.463
AND I'M ABOUT
TO GO SCHOOL 'EM

20:03.506 --> 20:05.073
IN SOME LASER TAG.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BOYS?

20:05.116 --> 20:06.596
[both]
OUI, MONSIEUR CASEY.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.597
THEY'RE GREAT KIDS.

20:07.641 --> 20:08.990
HOW DARE YOU.
WHAT?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.514
WE GET IT.
YOU'RE PERFECT.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.342
YOU'RE TALL,
YOU'RE HANDSOME,

20:13.386 --> 20:15.953
YOU HAVE TWO ADORABLE CHILDREN
FROM A TERRIBLE COUNTRY,

20:15.997 --> 20:17.346
AND YOU'RE
TAKING CARE OF THEM.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.001
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
IN TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.222
OKAY, COOL. YOU ALWAYS
CORRECT ME WHEN I SOUND RACIST.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
I DON'T CORRECT YOU,
AND YOU DIDN'T SOUND RACIST.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.791
AND YEAH, WE'RE LAME,
WE'RE HINDU,

20:27.835 --> 20:29.402
WE USED A GROUPON
FOR BURRITOS,

20:29.445 --> 20:31.708
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S
OUR LOT IN LIFE AND WE LOVE IT,

20:31.752 --> 20:33.406
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE THE LAHIRIS ALONE,

20:33.449 --> 20:34.798
AND, UH,
TO BURRITO TIME.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.278
BOOM.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.975
HEY.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.194
I'M SORRY.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.458
I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.243
THE WAY I TALKED YOU
AFTER CHURCH THE OTHER DAY

20:44.286 --> 20:45.287
WAS NOT APPROPRIATE.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.941
IT'S JUST,
I WAS COMIN' OFFSTAGE,

20:46.984 --> 20:50.945
AND IT CAN BE TOUGH TO COME DOWN
AND NOT BE SO...FULL OF MYSELF.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.556
I BET IT'S HARD TO COME DOWN
FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.036
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
JUDGED YOU.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.212
I'M PRICE CONSCIOUS TOO,
AND BURRITOS CAN BE EXPENSIVE.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.213
ARE YOU DONE?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.823
ARE YOU DONE?

20:59.867 --> 21:01.738
YEAH, I'M CASEY,
BY THE WAY.

21:01.782 --> 21:02.739
HI. RISHI.

21:02.783 --> 21:03.914
RAPPER.
SCIENTIST.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.568
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.832
KIND OF A CRAZY COINCIDENCE
RUNNING INTO YOU.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.008
BUT IF GOD'S TAUGHT ME
ANYTHING,

21:11.052 --> 21:12.967
IT'S THAT THERE ARE
NO COINCIDENCES.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.011
YOU GUYS READY TO GO?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.709
ALLONS-Y, LES ENFANTS.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.058
[both]
OUI, MONSIEUR CASEY!

21:17.101 --> 21:18.929
YOU STARTED LOVING JESUS
FOR THAT GUY?

21:18.973 --> 21:23.064
HE'S NOT 100% BAD.
HE'S JUST...MOSTLY TERRIBLE.
