Lisa, come on.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.796
Fine. She doesn't get her skin.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.803
Lisa insulted us, Mom.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.805

Dear Log: It won't be long now
before my mind melts...

14:10.816 --> 14:13.216

Soon, the arts and literature
I love will be replaced...

14:16.322 --> 14:18.916
by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps.

14:19.024 --> 14:22.425
It's time to give my brain
its last meal.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.936
Oh, Kenny. Look at the interplay
of light and shadow.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.334
It's so luminous and vibrant!

You have to listen
to the notes she's <i>not</i> playing.

I can do that at home.

[Door Dings]

14:57.630 --> 15:02.397
Son, I represent a group of oil tycoons
who make foolish purchases.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.299
We already bought us
a stained glass bathrobe...

15:05.404 --> 15:07.429
and the world's fattest racehorse.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.742
Oh, no.
I could never sell him.

Ah, well, Sanjay.
That is the end of our freak show.

15:53.085 --> 15:56.680
We must relinquish
the giddy glamour of show business...

using too many augmented ninths.

Aw, they just came

Oh, good. I figure if you've got
something special to say...

I'm sorry, little girl.
We don't just put people on TV.

- Uh, you bet I am.
- Okay. Makeup.

17:00.652 --> 17:04.179
I'm getting worried about Lisa.
She's been gone for hours.

17:04.289 --> 17:07.781
If I were her, I'd be buying me
a great big chocolate apology cake.

17:07.893 --> 17:11.021

the wave of towel snappings will get worse...

17:11.130 --> 17:13.121

And now, with an editorial reply,

Hello. My name is Lisa Simpson.

- <i>I'm supposed to talk to you</i>
<i>about Rroposition 305.</i>
- Moochir war widows.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.404
But I have something
more important to say.

17:27.512 --> 17:33.008
For reasons beyond my control, I will soon
become vapid, sluggish and slow-witted.

17:33.118 --> 17:37.020
So before that happens, I want to share some
things with you that have meant a lot to me.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.955
What is she doir out there?
I'll cut off her mike.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.586
No, no, no. Let her speak.
I'm trying to get fired.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.096
And please don't deprive yourself
of wonderful books like...

17:47.199 --> 17:51.033
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird, Harriet the Spy</i>
<i>and Yertle the Turtle...</i>

17:51.136 --> 17:54.503
possibly the best book
ever written on the subject of turtle stacking.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.039
She's got that right.

17:56.141 --> 17:59.804
Beauty is all around us,
and not just in pageants and parlors.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.176
You can find it
in the swirl of galaxies...

18:02.281 --> 18:04.511
or the swirl in the center
of a sunflower.

18:04.616 --> 18:07.517
That's a good idea.
Let's go out for some frosty swirls.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.247
Homer, your daughter
is pouring her heart out.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.654
- We'll tape it.
- Why's she saying all this. Is she dying?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.490
Oh, she's just upset 'cause I told her
her brairs turning to mush.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.962
You know, on account of
the Simpson gene.

18:20.065 --> 18:23.125
Simpson gene?
That's just foolishness!

18:23.235 --> 18:25.760
No. Baldness too.

18:25.871 --> 18:29.898
So please, I beg you,
don't take your brain for granted.

- Better. Come look.

<i>Your father.</i>

19:11.783 --> 19:14.946
I rounded up every Simpson

19:15.053 --> 19:19.149
so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong
with the Simpson genes.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.192
This is your great-uncle Chet.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.523

Uh, this is your
second cousin Stanley.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.198
Um, I shoot birds at the airport.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.210

You probably should have
researched this first, eh, Dad?

19:54.426 --> 19:59.022
- What about you?
- Well, sir, I step in front of cars and sue the drivers.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.031

Fine, fine.

I'm Chief of Complicated Surgery

20:33.732 --> 20:35.597
That means you went
to college, right?

20:35.701 --> 20:38.329
You have to if you want to be
an architect.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.405
Or an environmental lawyer.

20:40.505 --> 20:43.406
Or Regional Sales Coordinator

So all the Simpson women
turn out okay.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.018
That's right, sweetie.

20:54.119 --> 20:57.816
