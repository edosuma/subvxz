Uh, heroin.

<i>Hello.</i>

01:21.318 --> 01:24.275
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Um... it-it's-it's J.

01:26.024 --> 01:27.696
<i>J who?</i>

01:27.919 --> 01:29.783
Uh, Josh.

01:31.423 --> 01:33.710
<i>Josh, what's it been, baby?</i>

01:33.735 --> 01:35.983
<i>10... No, it's been 11 years.</i>

01:36.008 --> 01:37.907
- <i>How are you?</i>
- Um, yeah. I-I'm good.

01:37.942 --> 01:39.629
Um...

01:39.663 --> 01:41.663
Mom OD'd.

01:42.476 --> 01:43.961
She died.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.673
<i>Oh, Josh.</i>

01:48.266 --> 01:51.553
<i>Sweetheart, why don't you just
go and pack up your things?</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:52.858
Okay.

01:52.944 --> 01:55.278
Uh... d-do you know where we live?

02:14.811 --> 02:16.647
Is that all you got?

02:17.316 --> 02:20.066
Uh, yeah, and my bike downstairs.

02:20.169 --> 02:22.878
Come here. Give me a hug.

02:58.281 --> 02:59.618
Yo...

03:00.008 --> 03:01.649
Julia up there?

03:04.297 --> 03:05.589
No.

03:06.983 --> 03:09.586
Your moms owes me $90.

03:09.788 --> 03:12.609
The taste I gave her
yesterday wasn't a handout.

03:12.778 --> 03:14.730
- You got $90?
- No.

03:15.716 --> 03:16.970
- Huh?
- No.

03:23.435 --> 03:26.516
Tell her I don't get paid,
I'm coming back tomorrow...

03:26.584 --> 03:28.906
draggin' her by her
hair out to the corner.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.168
I want my money.

03:40.376 --> 03:41.813
Who was that?

03:42.102 --> 03:44.466
Uh, it was nobody. It's just a neighbor.

03:52.876 --> 03:55.418
Why don't you get your
stuff out of the truck?

04:12.153 --> 04:14.012
God damn it.

04:14.807 --> 04:16.862
I'm gone for an hour...

04:20.529 --> 04:21.928
Son of a...

04:38.967 --> 04:40.303
<i>Whoo!</i>

04:46.538 --> 04:48.455
My cupcakes are ruined.

04:48.537 --> 04:50.412
You can't do one simple thing?

04:50.437 --> 04:52.143
You told us to come over,
not to do the cooking.

04:52.168 --> 04:55.123
Well, that's what the note
was for. Can't any of you read?

04:58.276 --> 04:59.518
You remember your uncles.

04:59.543 --> 05:00.783
- Don't you, J?
- Hey.

05:00.938 --> 05:02.649
Hey, how you doin'?

05:02.792 --> 05:04.278
Really sorry about your mom, man.

05:04.334 --> 05:06.426
Oh, thanks. You too.

05:06.924 --> 05:08.455
Hey, it's been forever.

05:08.927 --> 05:10.700
Barely recognize you.

05:10.786 --> 05:13.606
That's 'cause he was like
5 the last time you saw him.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.430
Remember you and Julia were high
and like, really going at it.

05:16.455 --> 05:18.789
Oh, right, yeah, she just
threw something at you. Uh...

05:18.852 --> 05:21.054
- Uh, ah, coleslaw.
- Coleslaw, she threw coleslaw.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.281
- Of course. Amazing.
- Guys!

05:22.306 --> 05:23.817
- Guys...
- What?

05:23.878 --> 05:25.304
Shut up.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.888
You want a beer or somethin'?

05:28.004 --> 05:29.754
Oh, no, thanks. I'm-I'm good.

05:29.868 --> 05:31.478
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

05:31.513 --> 05:34.198
Good thing I didn't leave
the roast in your hands.

05:34.945 --> 05:38.637
How about I whip up another batch
of cupcakes, chocolate or vanilla, J?

05:39.121 --> 05:40.587
Uh, I'm not really that hungry.

05:40.622 --> 05:42.622
Hey, you want a real drink then?

05:42.710 --> 05:44.851
We got tequila, we got gin.

05:45.499 --> 05:48.966
Uh, I'm... I'm really...
I'm really tired so...

05:48.991 --> 05:50.788
Course you are, baby.

05:50.922 --> 05:52.753
You had a rough day.

05:52.808 --> 05:55.651
You go on in and take a
nap. I'll save you a plate.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.197
Okay, thank you.

05:58.414 --> 06:00.828
Show J to Pope's room, Deran.

06:03.469 --> 06:04.669
Yo...

06:08.868 --> 06:10.157
See you later.

06:12.401 --> 06:15.206
So, um... do y'all still live here?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.528
Uh, no, we all got our own places.

06:19.165 --> 06:21.529
I don't know. We crash
here when we feel like it.

06:22.427 --> 06:24.496
Helps keep Smurf happy, you know?

06:24.576 --> 06:25.784
Smurf?

06:25.924 --> 06:27.302
Your grandmother.

06:27.509 --> 06:28.783
Ah.

06:28.851 --> 06:30.650
Clothes are in the closet.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.217
Um, thanks, Uncle Deran.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.453
You're not seriously gonna
call me that, are you?

06:39.311 --> 06:41.613
What if he does, bro. You've
been called a lot worse.

06:41.678 --> 06:43.099
Got this TV out of the shed.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.329
Can't have you livin' in squalor, man.

06:45.354 --> 06:46.414
Oh, thanks.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.307
Just gotta find a right
bracket and put it up.

06:48.353 --> 06:49.594
Cool.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.442
Those your only shoes?

06:54.521 --> 06:55.433
Yeah.

06:55.468 --> 06:57.004
Dude, you can't be
wearing those around us.

06:57.029 --> 06:58.551
Yeah, get some decent Kicks, man.

06:58.576 --> 07:00.811
Yeah, you wanna get some
Nike Zooms or some Dunks.

07:00.836 --> 07:02.602
But not the orange ones, okay?

07:03.065 --> 07:05.269
- Those are just gay.
- Um, thank you.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.528
Cool. Get some rest.

07:24.571 --> 07:26.354
Hey, hey, have you lost your mind?

07:26.379 --> 07:29.034
Don't bring your dogs here if
you can't clean up after 'em.

07:29.059 --> 07:31.199
- I almost stepped in it by the pool.
- It-it's insane.

07:31.224 --> 07:34.057
I mean, what makes you think
that we can trust this kid?

07:34.082 --> 07:36.764
I mean, we-we... who knows what
Julia put in his head? I mean...

07:36.789 --> 07:39.315
She was too high to put
anything in his head.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.296
And-and if you're wrong, what?

07:45.338 --> 07:48.295
Well, I-I guess a decade or two
Folsom never hurt anybody, right?

07:48.322 --> 07:50.253
- Uh, shit.
- Hmm?

07:50.688 --> 07:53.001
"Don't take stupid risks."

07:53.110 --> 07:54.864
That's what you're always saying.

07:55.164 --> 07:58.442
This isn't stupid? Right before a job.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.369
You just gonna stand there?

08:03.383 --> 08:04.664
Huh?

08:06.895 --> 08:08.440
Yeah, look, I don't know, Smurf...

08:08.465 --> 08:12.643
Kid seems okay, but i-it's not a good
time to have him around. It's just not.

08:15.475 --> 08:18.464
Okay, stay on him
tomorrow. Just suss him out.

08:20.138 --> 08:21.341
What...

08:21.366 --> 08:24.638
just take him to iHop* and-and
ask him if he's gonna screw us?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.236
That's all you can think of?

08:26.271 --> 08:29.032
And if he's not wearing
a wire, what, he just...

08:29.086 --> 08:31.408
he's a part of it all now, what...

08:31.484 --> 08:34.005
- W-w-we don't owe this kid shit!
- Hey, shut up!

08:34.317 --> 08:35.631
All of you.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.653
Now what's the matter, my baby boy?

08:38.717 --> 08:41.615
Are you afraid he's gonna
get more attention than you?

08:44.152 --> 08:46.127
Suss him out.

08:46.152 --> 08:48.484
Are you too thick to figure that out?

08:51.066 --> 08:53.053
You want to be a leader?

08:53.197 --> 08:54.697
Make a decision.

08:54.808 --> 08:57.410
Don't be a pussy and play both sides.

08:57.944 --> 09:01.017
The kid is in until I say he isn't.

09:01.066 --> 09:05.739
And the next one of you to say a
word will not get a share of this job.

09:05.773 --> 09:08.591
Not a penny.

09:09.405 --> 09:11.640
Test me. Go ahead.

09:12.964 --> 09:15.907
And clean that dog shit off my deck.

09:33.369 --> 09:36.236
_

10:27.393 --> 10:29.243
That's where we could
hit the security cameras,

10:29.268 --> 10:30.743
but the alarm is a different story.

10:30.778 --> 10:33.650
There's about 40 seconds
delay, so we should be fine.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.649
(indistinct discussions continue)

10:35.704 --> 10:39.038
Wow, I sure would step over
you if I saw you in the gutter.

10:39.063 --> 10:40.895
Hope that means you slept well, baby.

10:40.930 --> 10:42.800
How about those sheets, huh?

10:43.198 --> 10:45.886
500-thread count, just
tell her you noticed.

10:45.998 --> 10:47.857
Uh, they were great. Thank you.

10:47.907 --> 10:49.989
Only the best for my boys.

11:08.594 --> 11:10.231
Son of a bitch.

11:14.737 --> 11:16.779
Sit down, baby. You must be starving.

11:16.823 --> 11:18.750
Uh, could I just start
with coffee please?

11:18.785 --> 11:20.494
Right there in the pot.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.122
Hey, what did I say?!

11:23.562 --> 11:26.402
What the hell did I say
if it woke me up again?!

11:26.812 --> 11:28.070
Huh?!

11:28.682 --> 11:29.991
- Just do it already, man.
- Yeah,

11:30.016 --> 11:32.151
- do it already, man. Yeah.
- Yeah?! Yeah?

11:32.176 --> 11:34.534
Wh-Where is that hammer?!
Where is that hammer?

11:34.747 --> 11:36.926
- Huh?
- Can't you just smash it on the floor?

11:36.951 --> 11:38.935
Oh, you don't think I'll
do it! No, I'm gonna do it!

11:38.960 --> 11:40.410
- Do it. You bought it.
- Yeah, fine!

11:40.435 --> 11:42.269
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, actually, you did.

11:42.294 --> 11:44.282
You always forget my birthday.

11:44.307 --> 11:46.250
I bought it for you and I gave it to me.

11:46.261 --> 11:50.430
I wrapped it up really nice and
I loved it, baby. I still love it.

11:59.847 --> 12:01.051
Gimme a kiss.

12:04.889 --> 12:07.467
Will your friends be
joining us for breakfast?

12:09.364 --> 12:11.081
Sure as hell hope not.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.514
No bacon and eggs?

12:12.539 --> 12:14.434
You know, I sh... I should
probably go to school.

12:14.459 --> 12:16.470
You can't go to school
on an empty stomach.

12:16.504 --> 12:17.916
That's fine. I'll grab
something on the way.

12:17.941 --> 12:20.628
Your mom just died,
man. That's a free pass.

12:21.118 --> 12:24.991
Yeah, there's a six-foot left at
San Onofre. Isn't that right, Craig?

12:25.479 --> 12:26.679
Yeah.

12:27.269 --> 12:28.888
Should be killer, man. You should come.

12:28.984 --> 12:30.682
- You surf?
- I get by.

12:31.561 --> 12:32.761
Are you going too?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.650
Nah, I stayed the night. I'm
gonna go back,  check on my kid.

12:34.675 --> 12:36.991
Aww, give my love to Cath and the baby.

12:39.552 --> 12:40.752
Will do.

12:46.847 --> 12:48.114
What do you say, J?

12:49.050 --> 12:50.747
Wanna get a little closer to God?

12:50.772 --> 12:52.649
Um... no thanks.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.180
I'm good.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.180
Is he going to do this the whole way?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.684
Yeah, unless he bites it.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.933
Oh, you just get by, huh?

13:45.326 --> 13:46.968
Carved that up pretty good, man.

13:47.063 --> 13:48.572
I get lucky sometimes.

13:48.597 --> 13:50.026
Yeah, or you're just liar.

13:57.139 --> 13:58.707
Ah, look at these assholes.

14:00.559 --> 14:01.871
Gonna waste this.

14:08.576 --> 14:10.515
Hey, hey, you on the right!

14:11.129 --> 14:12.329
What the hell?

14:12.454 --> 14:13.654
Shit!

14:27.845 --> 14:30.568
What the hell was that?
Ever heard of surf etiquette?

14:30.593 --> 14:34.154
Yeah it means jank-ass rookies like you
should go find a beginners break, bitch.

14:34.179 --> 14:36.084
- Move on!
- <i>Like what, you own it?</i>

14:36.570 --> 14:38.135
Ocean belongs to all of us.

14:40.093 --> 14:41.721
Trailer-trash losers.

14:48.902 --> 14:50.318
- You bat, I'll beat.
- Yeah.

15:05.909 --> 15:08.241
Okay, here we go.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.641
<i>Just drop in earlier too, man.</i>

15:13.742 --> 15:15.800
<i>Dude, look at my straps.</i>

15:20.991 --> 15:22.361
<i>Asshole, hey!</i>

15:22.386 --> 15:23.731
- <i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
- <i>Asshole!</i>

15:24.500 --> 15:25.901
<i>Cut my rack straps?</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:27.255
Show 'em who's king, man.

15:28.392 --> 15:29.592
<i>Did you?</i>

15:29.991 --> 15:31.364
<i>I'm talkin' to you!</i>

15:31.690 --> 15:33.076
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Do it.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.476
Huh? What?

15:36.554 --> 15:37.844
Shit!

15:38.952 --> 15:40.519
Come on, man, seriously?

15:48.383 --> 15:49.674
How'd that feel?

15:50.870 --> 15:52.822
Get a little stiffy, huh?

16:03.527 --> 16:05.497
Yo, we got new surfboards.

16:10.288 --> 16:11.488
Okay...

16:12.334 --> 16:15.036
You're gettin' farther from the
edge, man. Think you can do it?

16:15.068 --> 16:16.959
Lot of concrete between
you and the pool.

16:17.318 --> 16:20.080
You just worry about
yourself, man. Watch and learn.

16:23.637 --> 16:24.837
Nailed it!

16:24.862 --> 16:26.780
Who's got the coolest
daddy in the world?

16:26.805 --> 16:29.250
Why aren't you in the water?
You got a suit for her?

16:29.275 --> 16:31.392
I'll take you in your
undies, wanna go in?

16:31.417 --> 16:33.498
She was up all night, fever.

16:33.523 --> 16:35.582
Yeah, well the cold
water will do her good.

16:46.874 --> 16:48.773
Be sure y'all jump real quick.

16:51.086 --> 16:54.054
- I can beat that!
- Ah, yeah, well don't try it.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.023
Lina, doesn't need a
quadraplegic for a dad.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.248
Come here.

16:57.389 --> 16:58.887
These are my triple thrusters!

16:58.974 --> 17:01.292
- Baz... no!
- Yeah.

17:01.941 --> 17:03.141
Okay.

17:13.352 --> 17:14.569
Your turn, J.

17:14.696 --> 17:16.684
Come on. We'll get you
a motorized wheelchair.

17:16.708 --> 17:21.651
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J...

17:21.675 --> 17:25.647
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J...

17:25.723 --> 17:29.864
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J...

17:31.262 --> 17:36.219
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J...

17:36.244 --> 17:37.926
Come on, do it, come on!

17:38.232 --> 17:40.324
- J, J, J, J...
- Baz?

17:40.799 --> 17:43.217
- J, J, J, J, J...
- Come on, let's go, J!

17:43.242 --> 17:44.452
You don't have to do it, man.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.508
- Forget it.
- Bullshit, the hell he doesn't!

17:46.533 --> 17:50.730
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J...

18:16.542 --> 18:18.467
_

18:38.740 --> 18:40.169
Jesus!

18:42.731 --> 18:43.931
Who are you?

18:44.202 --> 18:46.737
<i>J, honey, are you okay?</i>

18:48.118 --> 18:50.164
- Who's J?
- I'm... um...

18:50.189 --> 18:52.562
I-I'm Josh. Julia's kid.

18:52.587 --> 18:54.694
- She's here?
- No.

18:56.485 --> 18:58.285
<i>J, can you hear me?</i>

18:58.791 --> 19:00.207
J, love, what hap...

19:02.712 --> 19:04.449
You just ruined my surprise.

19:06.071 --> 19:07.389
Hey, baby.

19:08.759 --> 19:09.959
Mm.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.084
Mmm.

19:18.568 --> 19:21.420
I just wish you would've let
us know you were comin' home.

19:21.445 --> 19:22.906
We would've picked you up.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.457
With balloons and a home-made sign.

19:26.025 --> 19:27.862
In a limo with two hookers in the back.

19:27.887 --> 19:29.544
Yeah and an 8-ball of speed.

19:33.850 --> 19:36.007
Why didn't you say you were up
again, when I visited last week?

19:36.032 --> 19:40.057
Ah, I figured I'd get rejected,
like the last two times.

19:40.559 --> 19:43.376
Mm, it's about time that parole
board came to it's senses.

19:43.401 --> 19:46.115
Six years for a bank robery
where no one gets hurt.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.278
Three you've done are
crime enough, baby.

19:50.304 --> 19:52.737
Three years and nineteen days.

19:55.637 --> 19:59.485
Well, whatever it is, we are
just very happy you're home.

19:59.972 --> 20:03.410
Just so sorry you had to come
home to the news about Julia.

20:05.092 --> 20:07.181
I'm... I'm gonna go out for awhile.

20:08.185 --> 20:09.385
Where you goin'?

20:09.475 --> 20:11.326
Ah, just to my girlfriend's place.

20:11.357 --> 20:13.657
Oh, I-I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

20:15.906 --> 20:18.512
Oh, it's just more like
this girl that I know.

20:18.538 --> 20:20.151
You have to bring her by sometime.

20:23.429 --> 20:27.480
- Yeah, absolutely.
- So, you're living here, huh, J?

20:29.033 --> 20:30.233
Mm...

20:32.125 --> 20:33.455
Part of it all now?

20:33.480 --> 20:37.236
Okay, he's been here for one day,
sweetie. Don't make his head hurt.

20:37.261 --> 20:38.703
Let me drive you over.

20:39.961 --> 20:41.528
You and me can catch up.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.315
Thanks. I've got my bike.

20:46.515 --> 20:47.760
See you later.

21:48.109 --> 21:50.665
I'm making you meatloaf with
the hard boiled egg in it.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.963
Nice and spicy, just like you like it.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.588
There you go, dude.

21:57.966 --> 21:59.316
Welcome home, man.

22:01.717 --> 22:03.949
- <i>Cheers!</i>
- Letting him go to his girlfriend's,

22:03.974 --> 22:06.643
- to blab about whatever?
- Ah, he's not nothing to blab about.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.511
Anyway, the kid seems okay, doesn't he?

22:08.537 --> 22:10.953
- Seems good.
- Even Craig thinks so.

22:10.978 --> 22:13.754
Oh, if Craig thinks so,
what is there to worry about?

22:20.964 --> 22:22.685
So, what are we planning next?

22:30.014 --> 22:31.214
Shit!

22:32.092 --> 22:33.609
You're not gonna tell me,

22:33.634 --> 22:36.112
- I'm not part of this any more?
- Yes you're a part of it.

22:36.137 --> 22:40.202
But in case it slipped your mind,
this is your first day out of prison.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.946
Now you're just gonna
have to sit this one out.

22:41.971 --> 22:44.840
And where should I sit
exactly, since J is in my room?

22:44.865 --> 22:46.973
Sleep on the sofa for a night or two.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.840
A night or two, whoa!

22:50.293 --> 22:53.085
You can not stay here, sweetie.

22:53.109 --> 22:56.021
We can't have parole
officers popping in all

22:56.046 --> 22:58.474
day and night to give you piss tests.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.903
No, screw it, I'll
just crash at my place.

23:05.007 --> 23:06.337
Yeah, you can't...

23:10.988 --> 23:12.880
- we sold it.
- You what?

23:14.464 --> 23:15.664
Pope...

23:16.315 --> 23:19.994
we're gonna get you a new place.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

23:51.975 --> 23:54.989
You know, for a bad influence you're
not really pullin' your weight.

23:59.393 --> 24:00.981
I missed you in Chem today.

24:01.353 --> 24:04.920
Aunt Mara almost caught me thinking
about you with my hand down my panties.

24:06.543 --> 24:08.383
Help me with my homework?

24:09.384 --> 24:13.832
- Mole maths and mass maths...
- Hmm, stoichiometry.

24:14.064 --> 24:15.588
I don't get any of it.

24:16.305 --> 24:17.505
Do you?

24:18.753 --> 24:20.032
Of course you do.

24:28.441 --> 24:29.641
J?

24:32.473 --> 24:34.226
Jesus, J.

24:35.362 --> 24:36.562
She died?

24:38.167 --> 24:39.367
Yeah.

24:40.463 --> 24:41.791
Well, are you okay?

24:42.120 --> 24:44.673
- I mean, where will you live?
- With my grandma.

24:44.735 --> 24:47.002
In the flats. She's
got a house on Denmar.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.882
Good. Okay, that's good, at least.

24:49.063 --> 24:52.117
I don't really know her. My
mom and her weren't close.

24:53.008 --> 24:54.384
Does she seem nice?

24:56.342 --> 24:57.542
Yeah.

25:05.649 --> 25:09.128
Pope looks good, don't you
think? I mean, considering...

25:09.584 --> 25:11.430
I wonder how much he got raped.

25:11.455 --> 25:13.371
- Deran!
- What, we're all thinkin' it.

25:14.005 --> 25:15.731
Well, why don't you
ask you little shithead,

25:15.756 --> 25:17.367
so he can stab you in the face!

25:17.913 --> 25:19.812
See Smurf's eyes when she saw him?

25:19.837 --> 25:21.481
Watch the docks!

25:21.867 --> 25:24.184
It's like part of her wishin'
they hadn't let him out.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.273
Gotta admit, it's been
a whole lot eaiser...

25:30.298 --> 25:33.666
Hey, he could've rolled on us,
we owe him, keep your mouth shut.

25:33.889 --> 25:35.204
Yeah, you sure do.

25:38.459 --> 25:39.659
Say it again!

25:40.759 --> 25:41.959
Guys...

25:42.393 --> 25:43.883
Say it to my face, go ahead!

25:46.179 --> 25:47.379
<i>Baz...</i>

25:47.882 --> 25:49.084
tweakers.

25:51.302 --> 25:52.916
<i>Baz... come on.</i>

25:54.569 --> 25:56.381
<i>Guys, now! Before they run.</i>

25:56.475 --> 25:57.828
<i>Fishin' anyone?</i>

25:58.420 --> 26:01.654
<i>Yo, check it out! 2 grams, 80 bucks.</i>

26:01.679 --> 26:03.246
- <i>What's that, like half price?
- Yo...</i>

26:03.695 --> 26:04.895
<i>Okay.</i>

26:05.320 --> 26:06.520
<i>Hey!</i>

26:09.718 --> 26:12.580
<i>Loose shit, don't run!
It'll just be harder on you.</i>

26:15.218 --> 26:17.596
<i>Get in the car, in the car!</i>

26:19.580 --> 26:21.581
<i>How long are we gonna let 'em stew?</i>

26:21.606 --> 26:23.550
<i>Till right before, like we planned.</i>

26:26.020 --> 26:29.054
<i>All right boys, piss, shit
and puke. Don't look back.</i>

26:29.944 --> 26:31.736
<i>Hey, get it over the car, come on.</i>

26:33.151 --> 26:34.882
There goes that 'new car' smell.

26:35.323 --> 26:36.523
<i>Nighty-nite.</i>

26:37.345 --> 26:39.304
<i>Enjoy your new bathroom, boys!</i>

26:56.808 --> 26:58.293
<i>Who cuts your hair?</i>

26:59.355 --> 27:01.843
<i>Ah... my... my girlfriend.</i>

27:03.784 --> 27:06.057
You think she'd do mine if I asked her?

27:06.307 --> 27:08.541
Shitty prison hair cuts!

27:11.404 --> 27:13.148
Well, maybe... yeah.

27:15.826 --> 27:17.355
You know where the boys are?

27:17.631 --> 27:19.308
No, I was at my girlfriend's house.

27:21.168 --> 27:22.368
Yo...

27:23.633 --> 27:25.858
you can tell me things, right, I mean...

27:26.800 --> 27:29.302
your mum and I were twins, so...

27:30.212 --> 27:32.022
we had a lot in common.

27:36.603 --> 27:40.643
We slept in the same room
for... years. Same bed...

27:41.087 --> 27:43.207
when it rained hard.

27:46.114 --> 27:48.235
You know, she was scared of thunder.

27:52.770 --> 27:55.469
So, if you ever wanna talk...

27:55.648 --> 27:58.151
or feel scared, I'm here for you, okay?

28:14.511 --> 28:16.304
Let me help you out there, sweetie.

28:16.511 --> 28:19.792
Oh, what you gave him my suit and tie?

28:20.026 --> 28:21.423
And my best white shirt.

28:21.448 --> 28:24.216
You hate these things, you
haven't worn them in years.

28:28.854 --> 28:31.714
You know that when you
were a little boy...

28:31.739 --> 28:35.752
he used to ride you to the
highway on his cute red BMX

28:35.777 --> 28:38.139
and teach you to throw rocks at cars.

28:38.222 --> 28:39.643
He'll come around.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.845
- What?
- My mum, had a shirt just like that.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.876
She used to borrow this
from me all the time.

28:50.155 --> 28:52.163
She must have gotten one for herself.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.910
Mm... I'm wearin' it to
feel closer to her today.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.599
Hm... how do I look?

29:01.990 --> 29:03.190
Good.

29:04.696 --> 29:05.896
Correct!

29:06.295 --> 29:07.613
Beautiful boy.

29:52.888 --> 29:55.023
Would anyone like to say anything?

29:57.214 --> 29:58.414
<i>J?</i>

30:06.994 --> 30:08.194
J?

30:10.924 --> 30:13.586
I know, sweetie, it's hard.

30:15.359 --> 30:17.353
<i>They don't belong here, J.</i>

30:18.594 --> 30:21.161
Don't stand there with 'em. Don't.

30:24.654 --> 30:26.392
It's okay, she's my neighbor.

30:30.274 --> 30:32.849
<i>Dina, not now, please.</i>

30:36.258 --> 30:38.563
Maybe she was weak, but
she did everything she could

30:38.588 --> 30:39.992
to protect you from them.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.734
Look... I... I'm fine Dina.

30:47.861 --> 30:51.728
Thank you for coming,
really, but not here, please.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.770
Get the hell out of here!

31:12.174 --> 31:13.374
Well...

31:14.432 --> 31:16.620
would anyone else like to say anything?

32:01.886 --> 32:03.086
_

32:03.111 --> 32:04.426
I guess we're Lutheran.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.380
Who knew?!

32:06.791 --> 32:08.358
Nah, must have been the cheapest.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.559
<i>Yeah, first six months
Lina cried all night...</i>

32:16.584 --> 32:19.959
I mean, she screamed like she hated
us. Wanted to smother her with a pillow,

32:19.984 --> 32:22.424
but figured if I did Cath
might stop having sex with me.

32:22.765 --> 32:24.548
It's a joke, man, feel free to laugh.

32:25.015 --> 32:26.790
I want in on the job.

32:26.962 --> 32:28.282
You're gonna get your cut, Pope.

32:28.307 --> 32:29.573
No, not a handout,

32:29.598 --> 32:31.495
- I need to do somthin'. Fine,
- You've been out for a day.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.421
- then push it a week.
- No, the place has got a new shipment,

32:33.446 --> 32:35.240
- no.
- New shipment, it's not a bank?

32:37.090 --> 32:38.351
- What?
- After you got caught,

32:38.376 --> 32:40.376
I started thinking
outside the box a bit...

32:40.880 --> 32:43.222
Last two jobs, cops
haven't even looked at us.

32:44.313 --> 32:45.881
Yeah, well what is it then?

32:49.174 --> 32:51.914
Smurf's call, man. She doesn't
want you in, you're not in.

32:51.939 --> 32:53.581
Sixteen seconds.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.728
- What's that?
- Sixteen seconds, how far I was

32:56.753 --> 32:58.083
- behind you at the bank that day
- Come on Pope.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.018
It's funny, that's all.
You trip on a waste basket,

33:00.043 --> 33:02.490
that guard goes for his gun.
If I had tripped, you know,

33:02.515 --> 33:05.302
and you had drawn down,
let me run out the back,

33:05.327 --> 33:07.535
then you'd have done the time,
I'd have stayed out here...

33:07.560 --> 33:09.553
free to think outside the box.

33:12.938 --> 33:15.570
Just toss me a bone, man.
Smurf doesn't have to know.

33:20.450 --> 33:22.220
All right, we need another car.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.748
- Big or fast?
- Both.

33:25.908 --> 33:28.452
- By when?
- 3:00 A.M., usual spot.

33:28.587 --> 33:31.458
The car, Pope, hey, nothing else.

33:43.421 --> 33:44.988
Where'd you get those shoes?

33:46.007 --> 33:47.255
The mall.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.355
- You went to the mall?
- Yeah, do you like 'em?

33:49.380 --> 33:50.580
Yeah.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.976
Where'd you get the money?

33:53.187 --> 33:55.317
Turns out my mum left me a trust fund.

33:59.725 --> 34:01.076
You didn't cry,

34:02.180 --> 34:03.380
at the funeral.

34:04.874 --> 34:06.260
Did you want to?

34:07.022 --> 34:08.222
No.

34:13.837 --> 34:15.592
<i>J, man, where'd you go?</i>

34:15.617 --> 34:17.521
Been lookin' all over for you.

34:18.893 --> 34:20.092
Jump in.

34:20.235 --> 34:22.221
<i>Yeah, she can come too. Come on!</i>

34:25.674 --> 34:28.362
<i>We're gonna bum around awhile,
and then go and eat with Smurf.</i>

34:28.583 --> 34:31.185
- Smurf?
- Ah, that's my grandmother's nickname.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.254
- I've got my bike.
- Oh man, leave it.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.597
We got you a new one.

34:36.706 --> 34:37.906
<i>Come on!</i>

34:45.780 --> 34:48.753
You couldn't have taken
the lock... all the way off?

34:48.777 --> 34:50.453
Should I have gift-wrapped
it for him too?

34:51.452 --> 34:53.277
- Hm?
- Unreal!

34:56.712 --> 34:57.912
No offense, J.

34:58.103 --> 35:00.805
When you said you had a
girlfriend, I figured she'd be ugly.

35:01.655 --> 35:03.159
You called me your girlfriend?

35:09.472 --> 35:10.912
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

35:13.882 --> 35:16.611
Hundred bucks if you can
catch this in your mouth.

35:20.107 --> 35:21.307
<i>Two hundred bucks!</i>

35:21.332 --> 35:22.532
Come on, you in?

35:25.879 --> 35:27.079
- Oh.
- <i>Oww!</i>

35:27.214 --> 35:28.716
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>

35:31.022 --> 35:32.532
- <i>Oh. Oww.</i>
- Oww!

35:32.557 --> 35:34.086
You really don't have to do this Nicky.

35:34.111 --> 35:36.484
Hey, shut up, man.
That's... that's loser talk.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.128
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Mm-hm...

35:42.818 --> 35:46.081
- Oh!
- <i>He shoots, he scores!</i>

35:46.106 --> 35:48.496
- <i>Very nice. Yes, well done.</i>
- <i>Boom!</i>

35:48.871 --> 35:50.090
<i>Thank you.</i>

36:04.616 --> 36:06.037
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

36:09.523 --> 36:10.981
Nicky's great by the way, man.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.123
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good lookin', smart. Where were

36:14.148 --> 36:16.710
girls like that when I was flunking
out of high school? You know.

36:17.148 --> 36:18.348
Thanks.

36:19.414 --> 36:20.812
So, you're still in school, huh?

36:20.837 --> 36:22.037
Ah, yeah.

36:22.853 --> 36:24.189
You get decent grades?

36:24.884 --> 36:26.084
I get by.

36:26.281 --> 36:29.796
Well, keep it up. We've got too
many dropouts in this family already.

36:34.822 --> 36:36.158
Rough day, you okay?

36:37.755 --> 36:38.997
Y-yeah, I'm good.

36:39.145 --> 36:40.415
- Good?
- Yeah.

36:41.403 --> 36:43.642
What about Pope, he
givin' you any trouble?

36:45.223 --> 36:46.427
- Ah...
- Just... just...

36:46.452 --> 36:48.346
tread lightly until he gets to know you.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.095
Should be all right, okay?

37:02.178 --> 37:03.378
Really, man?

37:03.811 --> 37:06.056
We're all just hanging out,
you gotta go choppin' in?

37:07.201 --> 37:08.594
Avert your eyes, Father.

37:08.619 --> 37:10.450
Why don't you try sleep for once
in your life, it's good for ya?

37:10.475 --> 37:11.675
Someone get Baz a drink.

37:12.028 --> 37:13.228
Make it a big one.

37:13.805 --> 37:15.005
You hate me.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.559
You really wanna get mellow right now?

37:16.584 --> 37:18.631
Maybe now's not the best
time, you know what I mean?

37:25.250 --> 37:26.450
You want a taste?

37:26.801 --> 37:29.700
- Oh no, she's good, man.
- Hey man, don't trample on her freedom.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.114
Sweetheart, wanna taste or not?

37:37.051 --> 37:39.092
Thanks, I-I'll just stick with weed.

37:42.356 --> 37:45.110
Deran, give the lady another toke.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.363
Hey!

37:48.511 --> 37:49.797
I'm goin' home.

38:04.759 --> 38:05.959
Hey.

38:24.664 --> 38:25.964
Detective.

38:27.022 --> 38:28.222
Barry.

38:29.608 --> 38:30.965
Nice night.

38:31.595 --> 38:32.795

40:37.725 --> 40:40.566
She's... beautiful, man.

41:09.349 --> 41:10.966

41:12.539 --> 41:14.545

41:14.570 --> 41:15.770
Are you?

41:17.547 --> 41:18.799
I'm okay.

41:19.617 --> 41:21.044
They need a car,

41:21.461 --> 41:22.679
for the thing.

41:23.016 --> 41:24.660
Get dressed, we'll go get it.

41:25.863 --> 41:27.725
- Baz said I should...
- What?

41:29.089 --> 41:30.978
Baz, said I should go with you?

41:32.383 --> 41:33.583
Yeah.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.416
He said, "Get a car".

41:37.182 --> 41:38.556
Come on, hurry up.

41:39.388 --> 41:40.988
- Come on.
- All right.

42:07.497 --> 42:08.943
Hey, pig!

42:32.894 --> 42:34.094
Aww!

42:34.712 --> 42:35.912
Oh!

42:36.305 --> 42:37.832
- Uh!
- Argh!

42:38.016 --> 42:39.216
Aww!

42:39.617 --> 42:41.835
<i>Can't remember a face... just sayin'.</i>

42:42.031 --> 42:43.608
I d... I don't.

42:44.554 --> 42:45.754
Uh!

42:48.779 --> 42:51.456
I know where you live.
You understand me?

42:51.615 --> 42:52.993
Yeah, no, okay.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.189
My keys...

42:57.381 --> 42:58.581
get 'em.

42:59.130 --> 43:00.330
Take it.

43:04.971 --> 43:06.171
Oh!

43:18.569 --> 43:20.969
Rise and shine, kids. Party's over.

43:20.994 --> 43:22.852
Oh, man, it reeks in here.

43:24.330 --> 43:25.530
Oh!

43:25.713 --> 43:26.913
Whoo!

43:28.570 --> 43:29.770
Get in front!*

43:31.320 --> 43:33.538
Hey, you did good, boys.
Thanks for the body fluids.

43:33.563 --> 43:34.987
DNA jackpot!

43:35.376 --> 43:37.138
This should keep the crime lab busy.

44:06.115 --> 44:07.470
It's feedin' time.

44:07.583 --> 44:09.989
3 grams. Don't do it all at once.

44:25.255 --> 44:26.540
What happened?

44:27.699 --> 44:28.899
Nothing.

44:30.531 --> 44:32.184
What did you do, Pope?

44:32.547 --> 44:33.957
What? Just...

44:34.203 --> 44:37.899
took J for a little test drive and we
hit a few bumps. No big deal, right?

44:41.333 --> 44:42.675
What?

44:43.950 --> 44:46.356
You want him to learn the
ropes, don't you? So...

44:46.958 --> 44:50.237
- I started teachin' 'em to him.
- You will not do that again.

44:50.380 --> 44:52.735
- Not without asking me.
- What am I, six?

44:52.760 --> 44:55.272
You will not do that again!

44:56.372 --> 44:57.705
Who's gonna stop me,

44:58.818 --> 45:00.018
you?

45:00.043 --> 45:01.243
Come on...

45:02.231 --> 45:03.955
you remember the game.

45:04.466 --> 45:05.941
Let go of me, Andrew.

45:05.966 --> 45:08.349
Oh, Andrew. You must be mad.

45:08.989 --> 45:10.865
Come on, man. Stop me.

45:10.934 --> 45:13.184
Come on, you remember. Play it.

45:13.209 --> 45:14.470
Play with me.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.970
Okay, how about now?

45:16.995 --> 45:19.100
Mommy, does that make it any easier,

45:20.478 --> 45:21.678
now?

45:22.971 --> 45:24.700
- What if I tickle you?
- Leave her alone.

45:24.725 --> 45:27.512
It's okay, J. It's okay.

45:32.766 --> 45:33.966
Pope...!

45:44.982 --> 45:46.182
Yes!

45:48.255 --> 45:49.455
Yes.

45:52.107 --> 45:53.654
That's it J, good boy.

45:54.287 --> 45:55.516
You pass.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.829
Come on. Let's get
some ice on that face.

47:07.220 --> 47:08.420
_

48:33.185 --> 48:35.194
- <i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>
- <i>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.</i>

48:35.219 --> 48:36.490
- <i>Come on, go.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

48:36.567 --> 48:37.767
<i>Whoo!</i>

48:43.386 --> 48:44.886
- Hey!
- <i>Hey!</i>

48:46.479 --> 48:48.148
Deran, God dammit.

48:48.448 --> 48:49.711
You said there'd be no security

48:49.736 --> 48:51.294
- on the south end 'til six.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

48:51.319 --> 48:53.154
- Stop the car!
- Drive, man, drive!

48:53.764 --> 48:55.514
- Now!
- Go, go, go, go!

48:55.677 --> 48:57.585
- Rub up against the dumspter!
- Peel 'em off!

48:57.610 --> 48:58.601
What are you doin'?! Stop!

48:58.626 --> 48:59.901
- Hey!
- Push it!

49:00.626 --> 49:01.826
Whoo!

49:05.284 --> 49:06.916
- Whoa!
- What was that?

49:12.633 --> 49:13.833
<i>Shit!</i>

49:23.878 --> 49:25.078
<i>Yeah?</i>

49:25.103 --> 49:27.753
Oh, hey, um... can I
speak to Gary, please?

49:28.119 --> 49:31.607
<i>There's no Gary here. Who's
this? You know what time it is?</i>

49:31.632 --> 49:36.360
Y-yeah... I-I'm sorry... I'm lookin'
for my dad. He-he used to live there.

49:36.385 --> 49:37.860
<i>Yeah, when was that?</i>

49:38.275 --> 49:40.853
I don't know... it was...
it was probably about, ah...

49:41.142 --> 49:42.922
about 15 years ago.

49:45.021 --> 49:47.503
You got a last name for your father?

49:50.796 --> 49:53.436
Uh...  no-no I don't.

50:22.843 --> 50:24.161
Where is she?

50:24.827 --> 50:26.059
You got my money?

50:26.757 --> 50:29.936
No? Well, why don't we start with
me taking that bike of yours...

50:29.961 --> 50:31.274

50:32.390 --> 50:33.864
You little shit!

50:41.105 --> 50:42.726
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill, chill.

50:44.813 --> 50:46.962
She's dead, asshole!

50:48.169 --> 50:50.828
She died from the
shit that you sold her!

50:50.853 --> 50:52.268
Nah, wait. Hey, don't...

50:52.293 --> 50:54.139
we're cool, all right. I didn't know.

50:54.164 --> 50:55.888
Hey, you don't owe me
anything, all right.

50:57.455 --> 50:58.655
Come on, man.
