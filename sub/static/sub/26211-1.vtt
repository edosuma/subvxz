16:43.300 --> 16:44.633
One has a lot more experience
than the other,

16:44.633 --> 16:46.433
but the one that doesn't
have experience

16:46.433 --> 16:48.433
has a good attitude so far,
so it's great.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.567
- So here's who we have

16:50.567 --> 16:52.767
for our first charter.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.433
- Well,
look who it is!

16:54.433 --> 16:57.567
- Mr. Foam Man,
our primary charter guest.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.300
His name is Steve Bradley.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.000
They were previous
charter guests

17:01.000 --> 17:02.767
and Steve's a friend of mine.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.266
The reason they call him
Foam Man

17:04.266 --> 17:05.433
is because he wanted
a foam party,

17:05.433 --> 17:07.133
and the wind was blowing
so bad,

17:07.133 --> 17:08.533
we couldn't get it
past his ankles.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.266
- This is not a foam party.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.300
More foam, bosun!

17:12.300 --> 17:14.533
Hey, come on,
make it happen!

17:14.533 --> 17:16.100
- It was just like

17:16.100 --> 17:17.767
a malfunctioning carwash.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.600
- So I should maybe make
a foamy dish.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.333
- That's cute.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.734
It's kind of nice
that we have a returning guest,

17:22.734 --> 17:25.066
because I know his
preferences,

17:25.066 --> 17:26.600
and I know that he'll be

17:26.600 --> 17:28.433
blackout drunk
most of the time

17:28.433 --> 17:30.433
So even if we mess up,
he won't remember.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.400
- So he and his fiancée Jenn

17:32.400 --> 17:34.567
are coming on this charter
to celebrate

17:34.567 --> 17:38.033
their two-year anniversary
and Jenn's 32nd birthday.

17:38.033 --> 17:39.467
They want a Polynesian picnic

17:39.467 --> 17:41.600

the black sand beach,

17:41.600 --> 17:44.400

and servers dressed up

17:44.400 --> 17:47.066

what are the alternatives

17:58.066 --> 18:00.066

leave the dock tomorrow?

18:00.066 --> 18:02.233

18:02.233 --> 18:04.433

Kate can come up with.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.633

day two,

the (BLEEP) I wanna say.
- I would just stop.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.166
- I think the time has come.

42:47.166 --> 42:49.166
I've decided
to make the split...

42:49.166 --> 42:51.033
- They told me to tell you
you have one hour,

42:51.033 --> 42:52.333
and you're leaving.

42:52.333 --> 42:53.700
- (BLEEP)! (BLEEP)!
- Man overboard.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.333
- What?
- Take it off now!

42:55.333 --> 42:56.734
- Get the life ring!

42:56.734 --> 42:58.467
- Aaah!

42:58.467 --> 43:00.700
[dramatic chords]

43:00.700 --> 43:02.767
- I-I need a minute.

43:02.767 --> 43:05.500
