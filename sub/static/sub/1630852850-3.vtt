00:26.840 --> 00:28.360
Hey.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.440
So, remind me again
why we're doing this.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.720
Team building.
At least, that's the theory.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.720
Finally! You're late.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.880
OK, here are your tickets.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.720
And... snacks!

00:40.720 --> 00:42.520
Aren't we waiting for the others?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.320
Hm?
The team building?

00:44.320 --> 00:46.680
Oh, yeah,
they all cancelled last minute.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.480
Except Dr Fonseca,
who was vocally negative

00:48.480 --> 00:51.000
about the whole thing
since the beginning.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.400
Now it's just the three of us.
OK, come on, it's starting!

00:53.400 --> 00:54.560
Oh...

00:54.560 --> 00:55.720
OK.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.320
ALL: Jay Jay!

01:16.320 --> 01:18.600
That's right!

01:18.600 --> 01:22.200
Hey, cutie, you want my number?
We'll talk later! Ha-ha!

01:22.200 --> 01:27.840
I am Jay Jay and this
is my little brother Prakash!

01:27.840 --> 01:31.800

01:37.200 --> 01:41.080
Are you ready to be astounded?!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.240
CHEERING
Yes!

01:43.240 --> 01:45.280
Oh, I love the circus.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.760

02:08.080 --> 02:12.160
In a moment, I, Prakash,

02:12.160 --> 02:14.160
will attempt to defy gravity and...

02:14.160 --> 02:15.360
Ha!

02:15.360 --> 02:16.560
HE GASPS

02:16.560 --> 02:20.480
Sister, what are you doing up there?
Come down.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.240
Stop her, she's crazy,
it's too dangerous!

02:23.240 --> 02:27.400
It's not safe. I beg you, come down.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.360
Please, tell her,
she must come down immediately!

My sister...

02:41.840 --> 02:44.040
Somebody help!

02:44.040 --> 02:46.640
She's seriously not moving?
Course she's not, it's a trick.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.560
Somebody help! Please!

02:48.560 --> 02:49.640
Wait for it.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.880
Anyone, please?!

02:50.880 --> 02:53.160
I don't know,
I think she's really hurt.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.520
We need a doctor urgently!

02:54.520 --> 02:56.440
Dr Hasan, go now.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.240
Call an ambulance.
Oh, thank God!

02:59.240 --> 03:01.160
This way, doctor, sir.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.080
Is she dead, doctor?

03:05.080 --> 03:07.200
Is my sister lost?

04:11.840 --> 04:15.480
Cold beer for me,
gin and tonic for you. Thank you.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.960
And one hell of a big problem
for both of us.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.280
Deportation?!

04:31.280 --> 04:34.160
This is dated nearly two weeks ago.
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

04:34.160 --> 04:35.520
I didn't want to bother you.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.800
Besides, you've got an entire
hospital to run.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.880
Ram knows this hotshot
immigration lawyer

04:39.880 --> 04:42.480
who turned out to be as much
use as a chocolate teapot.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.000
Ram knows about this?
I'm sorry.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.560
I wanted to try everything.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.200
Well, I...

04:50.200 --> 04:53.520
There'll be a way around this,
there's bound to be.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.360
All we've gotta do is find it.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.400
When I said "we", I meant me.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.760
Oh, well... I'll get us more drinks.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.000
That's it.
Just a little more, sweetheart.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.400
I can't.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.640
I don't want to do any more.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.880
OK.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.880
So, are we thinking
permanent nerve damage?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.520
I don't think so,
she's been awake for days now.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.840
Reflexes and sensation are normal.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.760
Her power's not bad either.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.000
Logically, she should really
be able to walk by now.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.480
I dunno,
either she's refusing to try

06:17.480 --> 06:19.840
or doesn't want to get better.
It's true.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.640
She should be ravenous, but...

06:21.640 --> 06:23.600
the poor girl eats like a bird.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
The flesh is strong,
but the spirits are weak.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.080
So... what do we do?

06:29.080 --> 06:32.680
Simple. You find out what she needs
and you give it to her.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.960
Something you won't find
in a surgical textbook.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.480
Is this another
one of your initiative tests?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.920
Oh-ho! You better get used to it.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.320
MARI CHUCKLES

06:56.120 --> 07:00.120
So, after a thorough investigation,
I am 90% sure

07:00.120 --> 07:02.800
that he's at George Parker
Bird Sanctuary,

07:02.800 --> 07:05.320
and the best way to go
will be from Purakkad.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.480
The driver is called Elvis.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.280
Elvis? Of course.
OK, can we please get a move on?

07:10.280 --> 07:13.280
It was this hospital's incompetence
that caused this whole situation.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.840
Madam, I understand your concerns,
but I'm very confident

07:15.840 --> 07:18.160
that he's in safe hands.
It's a good family.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.280
I don't care if they've all been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize

07:21.280 --> 07:23.560
and this Elvis bloke is
the grandson of Mother Teresa,

07:23.560 --> 07:25.000
Bobby's a vulnerable adult.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.120
Car, now!
OK, I've got this. Let's go.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.280
All the best.

CAMERA CLICKS

07:48.320 --> 07:49.920
It's a Myna.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.960
In England, people used to keep them
in cages and teach them to talk.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.920
In English?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.640
They're natural mimics.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.560
So, yes, any language.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.680
My nan had one.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.160
He used to spout nothing
but filth in a broad Brummie accent.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.560
Where is it?

08:05.560 --> 08:06.880
Just there.

08:07.920 --> 08:12.520
The one on the branch over here
is a Green Bee-Eater, see?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.120
Oh, yeah, great.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.200
CAMERA CLICKS RAPIDLY

08:18.200 --> 08:20.280

I think.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.880
CLICKING CONTINUES

08:33.520 --> 08:36.800
I had no idea they had
invisible tractors in India.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.600
Or is there another reason that
we're going at a snail's pace?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.120
There can be unexpected hazards.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.960
My father said to always
drive with caution,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.480
even if the roads appear clear.
OK, pull over, I'm driving.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.640
Excuse me,
I'm looking for the clowns.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.160
Brother and sister?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.200
Thanks.

SWEEPING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC

09:47.440 --> 09:48.600
Hey!

09:48.600 --> 09:50.080
No public back here.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.600
Hey, Prakash!
Don't you recognise him?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.520
He's our English doctor.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.880
Even more handsome in the daylight,
huh?

09:58.880 --> 10:00.840
I'm sorry if I led you on
last night, doctor,

10:00.840 --> 10:02.280
but I'm very happy being single.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.200
Spoken for.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.880
But I do need a favour.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.800
How can I refuse?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.200
Come.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.720
We're a circus act,
we don't do private performances.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.680
Even for sick children
in a hospital?

10:28.680 --> 10:30.800
Better get your bags packed,
brother,

10:30.800 --> 10:32.160
we're going on a guilt trip.
Hm!

10:32.160 --> 10:34.320
Did I mention I'm happy to pay?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.040
How much?

10:36.040 --> 10:37.880
1,000 rupees?

10:39.240 --> 10:41.360
There's a little girl
that needs your help.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.280
PRAKASH MUMBLES

10:44.280 --> 10:45.640
2,000.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.320
500.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.800
In advance, all of it.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.520
How do I know you'll turn up?
You don't.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.440
We may both disappear into thin air.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.440
WHISTLES
Gone.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.000
So, are you a gambler, doctor,
or do you always play it safe?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.520
Ha.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Do I get a receipt?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.760
Over my dead body!

11:24.760 --> 11:26.960
You told me to use my initiative.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.880
No clown is setting their
overlong foot in my hospital.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.600
Kids last night adored them.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.360
I think a little magic
is exactly what Karishma needs.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.560
Read my lips. No!

11:35.560 --> 11:37.240
Pfft. Fine.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.040
Well, in that case,
I'll call and cancel them.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.760
DISTANT HORN HONKING

11:45.000 --> 11:48.800
The Good Karma Hospital,
we are here!

11:48.800 --> 11:51.280
Damn. Too late.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.200
Looks like they're already here.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.280
Hello!

11:56.440 --> 11:58.640
500 rupee. Thank you, thank you.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.320
Are we sure this is OK?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.040
How much money do you have left?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.160
340 rupees.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.600
Then it's definitely time
we both used our initiative.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.600
You have the knowledge,
they need your help,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.040
so we charge them, agreed?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.800
Also, your English is very good,
so...

12:21.800 --> 12:23.880
I am English.
Yeah.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.440
As I said, it's almost perfect.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.760
Go, we can start at the lake.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.960
Follow me for our famous bird tour.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.600
MARI: How on earth did you
get Lydia to agree to this?

12:38.600 --> 12:41.400
She hates clowns.
In fact, she's terrified of them.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.960
I think they call it
a fait accompli...

12:43.960 --> 12:46.440
Right, no pratfalls,

12:46.440 --> 12:47.960
no excessive noise,

12:47.960 --> 12:49.760
and absolutely no juggling.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.200
This is a hospital,
not a music hall.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.960
And if there are any complaints
from the other patients,

12:55.960 --> 12:59.480
I will take great pleasure
in ejecting you personally.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.720
Do you understand?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.760
Perfectly clear.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.400
Excuse me, doctor, you have
something in your ear. May I?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.600
Please?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.520
WHISPERS: Oh, my God...

13:08.520 --> 13:10.640
Ooh. Oh.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.120
And another one.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.280
Oh...

13:13.280 --> 13:15.800
Er... Hm, no, that's it.

13:16.840 --> 13:17.960
You're welcome.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.160
Could we... have somewhere
private to prepare?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.880
Absolutely. This way.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.600
SHE EXHALES

13:32.960 --> 13:34.520
This OK?

13:34.520 --> 13:36.680
You can change
in the nurses' office.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.560
Do you have anything smaller (?)

13:38.560 --> 13:40.520
Hm!

13:41.680 --> 13:43.920
Hey, you all right?

13:43.920 --> 13:46.600
Erm, yeah. Slight headache.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.000
I always get a little tense
before we perform.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.640
But this is great. Erm...

13:52.640 --> 13:55.200
We'll need ten minutes.
No problem.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.960
So, to answer the question,

14:03.960 --> 14:07.800
Kerala has an estimated
533 different species,

14:07.800 --> 14:09.840
including over 30 different
birds of prey.

14:09.840 --> 14:14.040
But, here, we're concentrating
on ducks, herons,

14:14.040 --> 14:15.880
shovelers and ibis.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.000
Kerala is famous for its waterways,
and it's a haven for all waterfowl.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.600
In fact, in this one
location alone...

14:20.600 --> 14:22.360
Please enjoy the rest of the tour.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.560
..we can expect to see a variety
of different species,

14:24.560 --> 14:27.680
including one of my personal
favourites, the kingfisher.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.920
That's Karishma.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.600
She's the reason I asked you here.
She's been very sick.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.320
Physically, she's better,
but we can't get her to walk.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.000
She needs, erm...

14:43.000 --> 14:46.120
More than doctors can give her.
Don't we all.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.320
APPLAUSE

14:54.840 --> 14:58.480
Welcome, hello! Namaste, everyone.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.520
Ha-ha!

15:00.520 --> 15:03.440
Welcome to the greatest
magic show in the world!

15:03.440 --> 15:04.720
For our first trick,

15:04.720 --> 15:08.360
everyone,
close your hands for me like this.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.120
As tight as you can!

15:11.120 --> 15:12.840
You know why we're doing this?

15:12.840 --> 15:17.320
Because love is the strongest
emotion in the world!

15:17.320 --> 15:20.720
When you love someone,
you give them your...

15:20.720 --> 15:21.920
Heart.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.200
Heart!

15:23.200 --> 15:26.280
When they don't love you back,
your heart breaks!

15:26.280 --> 15:28.520
THEY WEEP

15:28.520 --> 15:30.160
Oh, yeah, I love you.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.360
But, today, whom do I love today?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.000
Is it you?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.200
Show me.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.240
No!

15:36.240 --> 15:37.880
You? No!

15:37.880 --> 15:40.480
You? No! You? No!

15:41.520 --> 15:43.760
It's definitely not you.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.400
Hey, it might be...

15:46.520 --> 15:48.480
Hello? Open your hands.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.840
Oh, doctor, you're very handsome,

15:52.840 --> 15:56.880
but I'm sorry, my heart belongs
to someone else today.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.800
Who has my heart?
Everyone, show me your hands!

15:58.800 --> 16:01.800
None of you here? There's no-one...?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.160
Huh?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.200
There IS someone there.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.360
Let me see who that is!

16:07.360 --> 16:10.160
Then it must be you!

16:10.160 --> 16:11.600
Open your hand, little one.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.600
A-ha!

16:14.600 --> 16:17.160
She has my heart!

16:17.160 --> 16:18.480
Whoo!

16:18.480 --> 16:20.560
APPLAUSE

16:26.000 --> 16:28.800
My heart!
APPLAUSE

16:32.120 --> 16:34.640
It just appeared in my hand.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.160
I don't know how.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.880
WHISPERS: Magic!

16:37.880 --> 16:39.720
MARI CHUCKLES

16:39.720 --> 16:42.080
I still can't believe it.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.960
Well?
What do you want me to say?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.520
That you were right and I was wrong?
Yeah, exactly that.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.520
Passed with flying colours.
Gold star?

16:53.520 --> 16:56.560
Well, I'm gonna disappoint you,
because technically... Dr Fonseca!

16:56.560 --> 17:01.280
..technically they were a magic act,
not clowns.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.920
Pfft!

17:02.920 --> 17:05.960
Even a neurosurgeon
can't split a hair that fine.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.520
Take it, it's the closest
you'll get to an apology.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.200
Ah, a win is a win.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.800
Er, excuse me.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
Hey, hey!

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
I just wanted to say thanks.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.160
They all loved it, and I still
have no idea how you did it.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.000
That's what makes it magic.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.280
Before you leave,
I noticed something back there,

17:24.280 --> 17:26.600
when you looked at me,
a little jaundice around the eyes.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.080
I'm sure you're an excellent doctor,
but I'm in perfect health.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.960
But you said you were
getting headaches, too.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.920
I can take a look,
run a few simple tests?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.880
No, thank you, we have to go.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.440
It'll only take a few minutes,
I can call you with the results.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.640
Last show is tomorrow.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.600
We leave the next day, and there
is still much for us to do.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.840
Goodbye, doctor.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.480
We're glad we could
help your patient.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.920
See, in the end,
we made very good time.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.200
You just need to be more decisive.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.600
Hi, excuse me,
I'm looking for my son, Bobby.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.200
He's got curly hair, er, this tall.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.440
Are you the mother
of Mr Robert Martin?

18:06.440 --> 18:08.000
Yes! Have you seen him?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.280
What do you call a deer
with no eyes?

18:12.240 --> 18:13.680
I don't know.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.320
No "eye deer".
KIDS LAUGH

18:15.320 --> 18:18.160
What do you call
a deer with one eye?

18:18.160 --> 18:20.520
I don't know.
A good "eye deer".

18:20.520 --> 18:22.440
Have you been to the pharmacy today?

18:25.600 --> 18:28.680
Mr Hasan?
Hey. Yes?

18:28.680 --> 18:31.960
Are you OK?
Sorry, miles away.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.480
There's stock missing,
I think we've been robbed.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.640
Anti-nausea medication,
laxatives and oral fentanyl.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.960
Whoever came in here
knew exactly what they wanted.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.040
Did you see anyone
come in here today?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.640
No-one.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.320
Was the door forced?

18:55.320 --> 18:59.160
No, that's the strange thing,
the lock was open.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.560
And my nurses swear that...
they didn't forget.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.880
No-one else had the key.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.960
Should I tell Lydia?

19:06.960 --> 19:08.360
Not yet.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.520
Let me see if I can fix this.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.280
If anyone asks in the meantime,
I took the medication for a patient.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.840
OK?

19:15.840 --> 19:17.080
All right, doctor.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.320
Hello?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.560
I knew it.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.680
What the hell are you doing here?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.040
Get out.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.280
Now.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.880
Look at all this.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.840
I can't believe I trusted you.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.440
I'm calling the police.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.840
No.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.080
Sister! Sister, we have a problem.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.240
I need you!

20:13.760 --> 20:15.080
Police?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.400
Sister?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.040
Mr Hasan, I'm a doctor...

20:18.040 --> 20:21.520
Help!

20:25.280 --> 20:27.240
What's happening, doctor?

20:27.240 --> 20:28.760
She's not breathing.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.080
Call an ambulance
then come back and help me.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.200
Now!

20:42.280 --> 20:44.320
40-year-old female
found unconscious.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.200
Opiate OD with respiratory arrest.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.920
I need a line and 400 micrograms
of naloxone now!

20:56.840 --> 20:58.320
Naloxone, please.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.240
Administering first dose.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.200
Nothing yet.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.040
SAMIR SIGHS

21:24.400 --> 21:27.280
MONITORS BEEPING

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
LYDIA: It's serious, isn't it?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.400
I could lose him to this.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.040
When the law fails,
all that remains is politics.

21:42.640 --> 21:46.760
Have you ever considered
talking to Dr Grover about this?

21:46.760 --> 21:49.440
You think she'd help me?
It's possible.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.760
I mean,
a fellow physician in distress...

21:51.760 --> 21:54.120
She has the necessary influence.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.840
Oh! You're suggesting I bribe her.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.040
Hold on, Lydia! No, no.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.840
Just throw yourself
completely on her mercy.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.800
Ask her for a small favour,
with the understanding, of course,

22:06.800 --> 22:10.120
that some day she might ask
something in return.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.240
I know, I know, it's making you
uncomfortable, but...

22:15.240 --> 22:17.520
I don't see you have a choice.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.120
It's obvious someone
put him up to it.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.280
Or there's been some
kind of misunderstanding?

22:25.280 --> 22:28.320
There's no way he could come up with
this by himself, no way on Earth.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.680
Your son was found
working on his own.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.480
Charging guests for unauthorised
tours is a serious matter.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.720
Oh, thank God. Are you OK?

22:39.720 --> 22:41.120
Really OK?

22:41.120 --> 22:43.400
I'm fine.
Now, you don't worry.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.520
We can sort all this out, all you
need to do is tell the truth.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.800
You have to understand something.
My son is a vulnerable adult.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.880
His judgement is poor and he can
be manipulated by others.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.120
This doctor has been treating him,
she can confirm that.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.200
Er, it's true I have
been looking after him,

23:00.200 --> 23:03.760
but not for a mental health problem.

23:03.760 --> 23:07.400
Like I said, someone's obviously
put him up to this.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.800
No!

23:08.800 --> 23:10.400
It was my idea.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.800
All of it.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.560
I was running out of money,
so I decided to charge people.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.400
They liked it, you can ask them.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.680
If someone's threatened you,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.480
you really don't need
to worry about it.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.200
I am here...
Mum, will you listen to me?!

23:22.200 --> 23:24.360
I said it was my idea.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.880
Just mine. No-one else's, OK?

23:26.880 --> 23:30.760
If someone put me up to it,
then where is he now, huh?

23:30.760 --> 23:33.400
So if you're gonna take me to jail,
then just...

23:33.400 --> 23:35.240
just take me.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.760
HORN BEEPS

23:39.520 --> 23:41.480
Just thought I'd try
and make a good impression.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.360
For once, I'm lost for words.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.920
I found this in, er, lost property.
Think it'll help?

23:48.920 --> 23:51.800
Only if she's colour-blind.
Come on, let's go.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.400
ENGINE STARTS

23:56.400 --> 23:59.680
Your liver function tests
are significantly deranged,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.960
which explains the jaundice
I noticed.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.520
So my working theory was,

24:04.520 --> 24:06.680
pair of junkies,
crushing up and injecting.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.800
But then I remember, no track marks
anywhere on either of you.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.440
Plus, you have a high calcium level
and severe anaemia.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.920
So, does one of you want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.240
You tell him, brother.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.480
I'm bored of telling the story.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.360
My sister has... ovarian cancer.

24:26.360 --> 24:29.160
It was diagnosed two years ago.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.480
They operated on her and...
tried some treatment.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.680
Chemotherapy.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.280
But it did no good.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.000
Liver got severely damaged.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.640
She got very sick.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.680
Couldn't perform.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.640
So I stopped.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.760
All of it.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.360
No more surgery, no treatments.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.680
And better.

24:51.680 --> 24:56.000
As long as I can have my pills,
show can go on.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.000
Dr Fonseca?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.440
Yeah.
She's ready for you now.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.680
Thank you.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.200
I'll talk to her first,

25:11.200 --> 25:13.280
and then if she needs
to speak with you,

25:13.280 --> 25:16.240
I'll come and get you, OK?
OK. Divide and conquer, understood.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.400
Go get 'em, tiger.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.160
Good luck.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.440
DOOR SHUTS

25:30.920 --> 25:32.520
How is she?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.120
Stable.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.520
Maybe better.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.320
Once the FFP has run through,
we'll need to drain her belly.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.360
You OK to prep for that?
Of course.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.320
These conversations
can be difficult.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.280
Do you want me to talk to him?
No.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.280
I'll do it.
OK.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.160
So, er, you got the message I sent,
all the details of the case?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.880
Yes, thank you.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.440
Also talked to the chief of police.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.800
Sounds like a nasty business.
Your friend is all right?

26:25.800 --> 26:29.200
Yeah, he's fine, it was just a...
silly scuffle.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.160
But all this immigration nonsense...
That how you see it?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.000
Nonsense?

26:34.000 --> 26:38.080
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.600
I meant that, erm...

26:40.600 --> 26:43.800
I feel this whole situation
could be easily resolved

26:43.800 --> 26:47.360
with a little...
common sense, on both sides.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.720
After all, Mr McConnell
has lived here for many years...

26:49.720 --> 26:51.080
Without permission.

26:51.080 --> 26:55.200
Yeah, an oversight that he admits
was a serious mistake on his part.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.720
An illegal immigrant
is an illegal immigrant, surely,

26:58.720 --> 27:01.240
no matter how long someone
has been in residence.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.560
And now he has come
to the attention of the police.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.800
Yes, but as I've explained,
the case has been dropped,

27:06.800 --> 27:09.720
so now we just want to sort
all this stuff out.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.120
Obviously.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.360
And, er, what would you
have me do about it?

27:13.360 --> 27:18.080
Well, I was wondering if you
had any contacts in immigration.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.240
Someone who could...

27:20.240 --> 27:23.080
Make this all go away.
Yes.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.000
Yes, please.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.040
It would be a great favour to me
and I'd be forever in your debt.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.120
So...

27:32.440 --> 27:35.880
..the great Dr Lydia Fonseca
comes grovelling.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.840
No, I'm merely asking for your help.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.280
The woman who risked a lethal
Nipah outbreak because her ego

27:43.280 --> 27:46.080
would not allow her
medical opinion to be challenged?

27:46.080 --> 27:48.040
Because I thought
it was the correct thing to do,

27:48.040 --> 27:50.880
and as it turned out, I was right.
No.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.360
You were lucky
and you damn well know it.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.680
Arrogant English woman
who always knows best.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.960
As we've already established,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.040
I'm an Indian citizen,
just like you.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.280
No.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.720
Not like me.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.680
This is my home.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.240
I've lived here for many,
many years.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.520
Mm, but, er...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.640
do you belong here?

28:18.160 --> 28:20.440
I'm afraid you have a problem,
doctor.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.320
Not all Indian politicians
are corrupt.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.400
I'm not suggesting that.
Oh, come off it.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.920
We both know exactly
what you are suggesting.

28:29.920 --> 28:34.320
If you haven't guessed
already by now, the answer is no.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.600
I could help you,
of course I could.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.840
But I won't.

28:39.840 --> 28:44.480
Because I owe you
absolutely nothing.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.800
And neither does this country.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.200
Goodbye, Dr Fonseca.

28:56.280 --> 29:00.920
OMINOUS MUSIC

29:06.920 --> 29:09.000
Well, how'd it go?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.960
Need me to come and plead my case,
full Perry Mason?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.200
Sorry.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.200
All my fault.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.000
What are you talking about?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.080
It's me that messed up.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.960
Hey...

29:24.960 --> 29:26.560
It's OK.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.400
We'll be OK.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.560
I promise.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.880
Come on.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.960
You know she's dying, don't you?

29:50.960 --> 29:54.760
Cancer's very advanced.
She has weeks, maybe less.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.960
The symptoms,
what she's going through,

29:57.960 --> 30:02.160
will only get worse -
the pain, nausea, exhaustion.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.880
I'd like to admit her.
She needs proper palliative care.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.080
We can help.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.400
But she has to stop.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.440
Doing that act every night...

30:12.440 --> 30:13.960
is killing her.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.280
Jay Jay lives to perform.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.120
It's the only thing she wants.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.120
No more operations, no more help.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.880
The circus leaves tomorrow.
We're going, too.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.880
And you can't stop us.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.360
Your son has a very
capacious bladder.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.600
I've always made sure
he keeps himself hydrated.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.920
Two litres minimum,
pee like Chardonnay.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.240
Isn't that what they say?

31:09.320 --> 31:11.400
See, what would he do without you?

31:15.920 --> 31:17.800
SHE SOBS
Hey.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.280
Hey, it's OK.
We've got him, he's safe.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.520
Everything's all right.
It's not that.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.200
Hey, it's OK, come on, just...

31:27.200 --> 31:29.600
Talk to me. What's the matter?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.240
Oh, I can't, not here.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.760
Bobby, erm, your mother's been...
stung by a wasp,

31:40.760 --> 31:43.560
so she needs some air.
What kind of wasp?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.200
Er...

31:46.200 --> 31:49.120
It doesn't matter,
just stay here, understood?

31:58.560 --> 32:02.520
SOMBRE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC

32:54.240 --> 32:56.320
Madam, sir?

32:56.320 --> 32:57.560
Thank you.

32:59.760 --> 33:03.360
I think she really enjoyed it,
watching me squirm.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.000
I don't deserve this,
nor what she said to me.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.600
Is that what people really think,
that I don't belong here?

33:12.600 --> 33:17.360
Lydia, you have given
your life to this place.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.280
This hospital is you.

33:21.040 --> 33:25.240
If I had just one rupee for
each person you have helped here,

33:25.240 --> 33:28.400
believe me, I would be the richest
poor doctor in India.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.200
For any other person,

33:30.200 --> 33:33.000
this would be the point
when I would offer to help them.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.280
I just don't know what to do.

33:44.160 --> 33:50.200
Well... there is a solution
to this entire problem.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.480
I call it the nuclear option.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.840
I've not mentioned it to you
because...

33:56.440 --> 33:58.360
..because you are not
going to like it.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.040
SHE SIGHS

34:04.040 --> 34:05.200
Hm...

34:07.080 --> 34:10.360
It was, er, nearly five years ago.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.880
Locally invasive breast cancer.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.400
I told him. I mean...

34:18.400 --> 34:20.080
how could I keep it secret?

34:20.080 --> 34:23.040
He was just 16 at the time.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.600
I tried to explain it all,
treat him like a grown-up, but...

34:29.160 --> 34:30.600
..he just lost it.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.720
He couldn't cope.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.120
That must have been
really hard for you.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.440
What did you do?
The only thing I could think of.

34:43.440 --> 34:46.120
I lied to him.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.680
And after the operation,
I told him that, erm...

34:50.680 --> 34:53.680
they'd made a mistake,
it wasn't cancer at all.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.640
Had the all clear and it worked.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.520
It was the best decision
I ever made.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.160
And he accepted it
and we just carried on,

35:03.160 --> 35:04.960
as if nothing had ever happened.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.640
Except now you are alone.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
Bobby was OK.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.920
That's the most important thing,
always has been.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.120
So...

35:15.120 --> 35:17.240
as a doctor,

35:17.240 --> 35:19.960
what would you say
to a breast cancer patient

35:19.960 --> 35:22.440
who's four years and eight months
post diagnosis

35:22.440 --> 35:25.360
and has persistent back pain
that keeps her up at night?

35:27.400 --> 35:30.960
Then I would say that...

35:30.960 --> 35:33.880
it could be any number of things
and that she shouldn't panic.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.200
But...

35:38.560 --> 35:41.560
But secondary cancer
is a possibility.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.720
And she should get it
investigated urgently.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.600
Guess what? Google agrees with you.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.040
Well done, top marks.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.880
NIKI EXHALES

35:50.880 --> 35:53.000
What the hell am I doing here?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.920
In the middle of bloody India
by the side of a bloody road

35:55.920 --> 35:58.840
talking to a girl I hardly know!

35:58.840 --> 36:00.680
About dying.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.880
I'm sorry.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.400
I'm just...

36:08.520 --> 36:10.480
I'm terrified.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.440
I understand.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.920
But we can help you,
we can take care of this, I promise.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.800
Look at you.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.040
What are you, 23?

36:28.480 --> 36:31.960
Dealing with a neurotic
nightmare of a mother

36:31.960 --> 36:34.320
and her newly-delinquent kid.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.720
Bet this isn't what
you signed up for, is it?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.760
Actually, I...

36:39.760 --> 36:41.640
I think it is.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.440
Oh, Neil Diamond. Love that album.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.280
Why don't you have it, then?

37:13.280 --> 37:16.520
What's all this in aid of?
What's it look like?

37:16.520 --> 37:18.600
Packing up. Gotta start sometime.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.600
Oh, right.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.680
Spoken to my sister, said I could
stay with her for a bit.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.640
Get a job in the pub.
OK, makes sense.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.160
Oh, no, no, no.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.000
This Sinatra is definitely mine.
And the Beyonce.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.560
Am I missing something?

37:33.560 --> 37:35.480
You do remember what happened today.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.600
I'm getting kicked out
the bloody country

37:37.600 --> 37:40.840
and you're more concerned about
your easy listening collection.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.720
Ram reminded me of something today,

37:45.720 --> 37:48.400
something you and I
had both forgotten.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.240
I'm an Indian citizen.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.840
Yeah, unlike me, I know.
Good for you.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.400
So ask me.
Ask you what?

37:55.400 --> 37:57.200
I'm an Indian citizen,

37:57.200 --> 38:00.960
so get down on your knees
and ask me right now.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.600
Are...?

38:21.120 --> 38:23.000
Lydia Fonseca,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.720
citizen of India,

38:25.720 --> 38:28.200
would you do me the honour
of becoming my wife,

38:28.200 --> 38:31.080
and make me both an honest man

38:31.080 --> 38:32.720
and a permanent legal resident?

38:32.720 --> 38:34.760
Try and stop me.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.400
Thank God!

38:36.400 --> 38:38.960
Now, please, help me up.
LYDIA CHUCKLES

38:38.960 --> 38:41.600
Urgh!
GREG LAUGHS

38:41.600 --> 38:43.800
LYDIA LAUGHS

38:53.960 --> 38:58.320
Now, today, we eat all of this, yes?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.720
Yes, sister.
OK.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.080
Is it true?

39:04.080 --> 39:07.600
They said Jay Jay was here
at the hospital. Yes.

39:07.600 --> 39:11.000
She's very exhausted.
Too much performing.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
We're helping her rest.
Can I see her?

39:14.000 --> 39:17.960
She's still very tired,
so perhaps later?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.400
OK?
OK.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.800
Good girl.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.080
Now...

39:22.080 --> 39:25.320
eat all of this. Please?

40:21.400 --> 40:22.720
Hello.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.400
I'm sorry,
they said you were exhausted,

40:26.400 --> 40:27.800
but I...
No.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.760
I just need to recharge
a little bit and then...

40:31.760 --> 40:34.120
I'm as good as new.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.480
JAY JAY GRUNTS

40:35.480 --> 40:36.920
See?

40:38.120 --> 40:42.240
Hm! Come. Come sit here,
girl with my heart.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.120
They said you didn't walk.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.120
But look at you.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.440
Is it magic?

40:53.440 --> 40:55.080
No, don't tell me.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.560
A true magician
never reveals her secrets.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.440
Unless...

41:00.440 --> 41:02.080
WHISPERS: Can you keep a secret?

41:02.080 --> 41:03.840
Yes.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.920
Cross your heart and hope to die.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.160
Then watch me.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.320
Ready?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.200
Blow.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.080
JAY JAY CHUCKLES

41:26.080 --> 41:29.160
Now watch closely.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.120
LYDIA: They both
totally refused admission?

41:41.120 --> 41:43.280
SAMIR: Point-blank.
He doesn't trust hospitals.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.960
It won't be long now, but she needs
proper palliative care.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.600
We can help her.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.120
So?

41:49.120 --> 41:51.640
What, do I just let them go?
You don't have a choice.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.080
It's her body, her life.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.400
That's if you're gonna
obey the rules.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.440
And if I don't?
Well, in my experience,

41:58.440 --> 42:01.240
a little light rebellion
can be extremely therapeutic.

42:01.240 --> 42:04.200
You see,
things work differently here.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.240
Sometimes, unconventional wisdom
can be the order of the day.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.960
Another test?

42:13.560 --> 42:15.040
HE SIGHS

42:16.320 --> 42:18.400
First, we numb the area.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.160
So she won't be in pain.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.600
Because the liver is damaged,
it leaks fluid into her belly.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.200
Which is uncomfortable.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.520
Push.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.360
Good.
Mm-hm?

42:30.360 --> 42:33.600
Then we make an incision,
like so. Hm?

42:35.240 --> 42:37.320
Good. Push.
JAY JAY GROANS

42:38.960 --> 42:43.360
And, finally,
we introduce the drain.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.760
Unscrew that
and pull the needle out.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.160
And then turn this tap,
release the fluid.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.920
You've got it!

42:59.640 --> 43:02.160
So? Don't keep me in suspense.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.760
Er, your blood tests are fine,

43:03.760 --> 43:08.720
but this area here
is a little suspicious.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.520
It's almost certainly fine,

43:10.520 --> 43:13.280
but Dr Nair agrees that
we should take a closer look,

43:13.280 --> 43:14.920
a more detailed scan.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.680
OK, fine. I understand, no problem.
Can we do that now?

43:17.680 --> 43:19.600
I'm afraid we can't perform it here.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.320
It means a visit
to another hospital.

43:28.200 --> 43:32.080
You know, I know it's not really
any of my business, but...

43:32.080 --> 43:35.800
do you think maybe you should
tell him what's happening?

43:35.800 --> 43:37.720
Bobby, I mean.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.640
Everything you need is here.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.800
Medication and dressings,
local anaesthetic.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.680
When the fluid builds up again,
you can drain it like I showed you.

43:48.680 --> 43:51.880
It's all written down,
the correct doses, everything.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.240
Thank you.
My number's in there.

43:53.240 --> 43:56.240
If you need help, you call me.
Day or night, OK?

43:56.240 --> 43:58.640
I'll talk you through it.
OK.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.760
Thank you.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.640
So handsome.
Ha!

44:05.480 --> 44:08.480
Ooh, OK.
Goodbye, doctor.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.760
Come and see our show
the next time we're in town.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.680
Try and stop me.
Ha!

44:12.680 --> 44:14.840
Oh, doctor...

44:17.560 --> 44:20.320
SHE WHISPERS

44:25.840 --> 44:27.560
What did she say to you?

44:29.880 --> 44:32.200
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.000
KIDS GASP

45:37.360 --> 45:40.280
Lydia McConnell.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.320
I like Fonseca.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.120
Well, apart from the fact
it's your ex-husband's surname...

45:46.120 --> 45:47.240
Yeah.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.400
About that.

45:50.400 --> 45:51.840
If we're gonna do this,

45:51.840 --> 45:53.960
I'm gonna need to sort out
some paperwork.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.160
What kind of paperwork?

45:56.160 --> 45:59.400
I might still be
a little bit married.
