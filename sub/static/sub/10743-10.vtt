        I have no idea, general.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.084
                 Maybe we should
                    ask ERIC.
         What?

20:21.086 --> 20:22.352
                      Oh, uh,
                   nothing, sir.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.588
                    Oh, um,
               this is the, um--

20:24.590 --> 20:25.923
            The date the machine
                  gave him.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.525
          He seemed most anxious
                to have it.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.993
Hm. My mother was born
     on that day.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.730
                     But, uh,
                  not in 64 B.C.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.732
  Sixty-four B.C.?
                       Yes, sir.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.099
            The person they were
                 looking up

20:36.101 --> 20:37.401
          was born in that year.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.136
Sounds to me like ERIC
   had a breakdown.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.771
                That's what they
                 tried to claim.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.374
           No, general, there's
          something behind this.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.644
      For some reason, this date

20:46.646 --> 20:49.279
               is most important
                to Major Nelson.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.781
     But he didn't say why?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.049
            Uh, no, sir.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.918
             I told him
      to stay away from ERIC,

20:53.920 --> 20:55.519
      unless Captain Reynolds
             was there

20:55.521 --> 20:57.287
     to program his questions.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.122
       I want you to rescind
            that order.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.123
           But why, sir?

21:00.125 --> 21:02.025
          Let Major Nelson
          use the machine

21:02.027 --> 21:04.395
       any time he wants to,
       only he'll be watched.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.397
 That's an excellent idea, sir.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.899
            He's going to Alaska
               for two weeks.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.100
 I'll tell him when he returns

21:10.102 --> 21:11.869
       that ERIC will be
       available to him.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.137
   The next time the machine
   gives him any information,

21:14.139 --> 21:16.173
 I want it sent directly to me.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.642
   I don't want Major Nelson
           to see it.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.344
          Hm. Amazing.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.613
    What's amazing?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.683
             That it took
     a 5-million-dollar computer

21:25.685 --> 21:28.319
          to catch Major Nelson.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.854
             Uh...moonlight ride
                 in the park.

ice-cream soda. Mm.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.825
                 The-- The time
                you suspended me

21:34.827 --> 21:36.727
                   over the pit
                  of crocodiles.
That was funny.
