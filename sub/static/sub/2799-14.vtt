01:18.120 --> 01:20.622
Red. Hey.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.125
You look good, man.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.626
It's been a while, hasn't it

01:24.668 --> 01:27.129
Haven't seen you forever.

01:27.129 --> 01:31.133
Of course, you know that
better than anybody.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.635
I'm... surprised
to see you here.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.641
Actually, you know what,
I'm not that surprised.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.144
Listen,
I'm glad you dropped by,

01:42.186 --> 01:43.145
'cause there's something

01:43.145 --> 01:44.146
I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.647
No, I-I just wanted
to say...

02:12.174 --> 02:16.678
?... Let the good times roll

02:29.691 --> 02:32.194
? Good times roll...?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.702
Oh, my God!

02:45.707 --> 02:49.211
Oh, my God.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.712
Are you.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.715
Are you okay?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.218
Yeah, yeah, I'm...

02:56.260 --> 02:58.720
I'm okay. I'm okay.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.722
I- I am so sorry.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.225
I was on the phone,
and I was going too fast,

03:03.267 --> 03:04.726
and I just

03:04.726 --> 03:06.228
Oh, God, um... I'm going to call 911,

03:06.270 --> 03:07.729
and I'm going get you an ambulance.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.232
I'm fine, honest, I am.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.733
Okay. Really, it's nothing.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.235
At least, can I just...

03:13.235 --> 03:15.737
I'm going to call the police
and make a police report.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.240
I'd really rather
you not do that.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.741
I'll tell you why.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.744
I don't, uh,
I don't have any insurance.

03:22.786 --> 03:23.745
No, no, no

03:24.246 --> 03:25.247
That's okay. I do.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.250
Look, it was my fault;
I know that.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.253
And that is exactly
what I will tell them.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.256
My dad just said,
if I ever got into an accident

03:34.298 --> 03:35.757
that I had to make
a police report.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.261
Can I tell you something, sweetheart?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.763
You're drunk
right now, okay?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.265
And you hit me

03:43.765 --> 03:45.267
Now, that's a DUl,

03:45.267 --> 03:47.769
and if you call the police,

03:47.769 --> 03:49.521
they're going to
take your license away,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.273
and they're going
to throw you in jail.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.775
Now, what I'd like you to
do is get in your car,

03:53.775 --> 03:56.278
drive yourself home and forget
that this ever happened.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.780
Can you do that?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.574
I'm fine.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.284
Go on.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.786
I'm fine, honest, I promise.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.580
You go

04:06.622 --> 04:08.290
Okay.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.807
Her name is Ally Sullivan.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.809
She's the registered owner.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.812
Patrol unit investigating
the wreck, found the body.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.857
So far, we have nothing
on the other car.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.818
Where's the nearest
traffic camera?

04:36.860 --> 04:37.819
Four blocks north.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.321
We've been pulling bodies

04:39.321 --> 04:41.823
out of this neighborhood
twice a month, it seems like.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.825
I think that's actually
an improvement.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.827
Yeah.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.828
Well, it's a cold night.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.830
I'm going to get you
some coffee and doughnuts.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.592
Nine, nine, nine,
five, five, two.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.345
Most people would have
called 911.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.850
Well, there's a seat-belt
contusion on her shoulder.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.352
So... she survives the crash.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.145
She gets out of the car,

05:12.187 --> 05:13.772
She dies on the street?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.357
Internal injuries maybe.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.359
Maybe.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.863
How'd the car end up
in this position though?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.365
It looks like
shecaused the wreck.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.368
Usually, the guy who hits
is the guy who runs.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.370
Well, either way,
they left the scene,

05:28.412 --> 05:30.372
so it's still a hit-and-run.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.875
And this girl's dead.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.877
So we may have a murderer.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.401
It's late.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.403
I was worried.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.405
Sorry.

06:05.407 --> 06:09.411
Love you.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.915
I love you, too.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.925
? Who... are you??

06:22.925 --> 06:25.928
? Who, who, who, who??

06:25.969 --> 06:28.931
? Who... are you??

06:28.931 --> 06:30.933
? Who, who, who, who??

06:30.933 --> 06:33.185
? I really want to know?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.437
? Who... are you??

06:35.812 --> 06:37.439
? Oh-oh-oh?
? Who...?

06:37.439 --> 06:40.442
? Come on, tell me
who are you, you, you?

06:40.484 --> 06:42.444
? Oh, you!?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.957
Ally was out late all the time.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.209
I never worried about her.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.961
She liked night clubs?

06:58.961 --> 07:02.714
She liked the club business.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.468
She wasn't a party girl.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.475
She wanted to be a VIP hostess.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.980
Way you do that in this town

07:17.980 --> 07:22.484
is you...
get your face out there,

07:22.526 --> 07:26.488
meet the right people,

07:26.530 --> 07:28.490
be seen.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.509
I taught her to be responsible.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.513
If there was an accident,
call the police.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.015
Help anyone who needed it.

07:55.017 --> 07:58.020
I'd say to her all the time,

07:58.061 --> 08:01.815
no matter
how pretty you are today,

08:01.857 --> 08:05.527
someday,
all that will be gone.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.530
She knew that.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.532
She knew she had
to treat people with respect.

08:12.534 --> 08:18.040
She always did the right thing;
that's why I don't get it.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.044
Whoever was in the other car...

08:22.544 --> 08:27.049
I don't care why they left

08:27.049 --> 08:29.051
All they had to do
was call an ambulance

08:29.092 --> 08:31.053
instead of leaving her
there to die.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.058
C.O.D. was hyper-extensio n of the neck

08:36.058 --> 08:38.559
with a rotational snap ,
resulting in a ruptured

08:39.061 --> 08:40.562
vertebral artery,
mid-cervical.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.063
Mid? Yeah.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.066
Most MVA's break down low
or up high, don't they?

08:44.107 --> 08:46.068
That's why I don't think
the accident did it.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.571
The injury was more
consistent with a stranglehold.

08:52.074 --> 08:56.078
The head was rapidly twisted
relative to the spinal column.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.580
She would have been
dead within a minute.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.083
Whoever killed this poor kid
knew what they were doing.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.101
I don't like Gruyere, Daddy.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.606
No Gruyere in it, sweetie;
I promise.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.108
All right, egg me.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.614
Hello, Mommy.
I'm cooking.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.615
I see that

09:33.615 --> 09:34.616
Good morning, honey.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.118
Morning.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.121
Yeah, well, the jury's
still out on that

09:39.162 --> 09:41.123
as far you're concerned.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.125
You must have
had quite a night.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.127
Yeah. I guess
I lost track of time.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.630
That Joey's a dog.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.633
If you don't watch out, he's going
to get you into trouble.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.634
I kind of doubt that.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.887
I wouldn't worry, though

09:54.928 --> 09:56.638
It won't happen again.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.140
These days, I'm all
about you, baby.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.641
I'm the baby.

09:59.641 --> 10:05.147
I know. I know, but daddies
can have more than one baby.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.148
Yeah,
pretty talk, talk, talk.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.441
Here, wait, wait.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.567
Try this, try this.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.651
Maddy made them.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.156
Mm, it's delicious.

10:14.198 --> 10:14.656
Very good.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.660
I'm glad you shaved.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.913
I barely recognized you

10:20.954 --> 10:22.664
under all that scruff.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.166
Hadn't quite finished that

10:30.672 --> 10:34.176
Hello, rapist.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.677
Man, I'm not a rapist.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.680
I was a date rapist, which is
not even the same thing.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.182
And besides, back then,
roofies were in.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.684
So you miss the action
of the good old days, huh?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.186
It's not like that.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.687
It's not like that at
all.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.689
What's it like?

10:53.695 --> 10:54.696
Can I get a soda, too?

10:56.698 --> 10:58.700
I'm, like, parched.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.703
You want to tell me what your
fingerprints are doing on a cup

11:01.745 --> 11:02.704
in a dead girl's car?

11:03.205 --> 11:04.706
Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.208
I was out at Jet...

11:06.208 --> 11:08.210
I was kind of faded, I guess.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.712
Um, I bumped into Ally,
and she offered me a ride home.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.214
I needed it.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.715
So that's what you were
doing on Harmon Road?

11:14.216 --> 11:15.717
Yeah, Ally don't care
where I live; she's a cool girl.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.219
You were close?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.720
Oh, yeah.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.222
Were you banging her?

11:22.224 --> 11:24.226
Nah.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.728
So, what, are you like,
pen pals? Girlfriends? What?

11:27.229 --> 11:29.231
No, look, we really
didn't talk that much.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.233
But we would text
all the time.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.235
That's, like, when
you use your cell phone

11:33.277 --> 11:34.736
to send, like, you know, words.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.239
Yeah. I know what
text messaging is.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.532
Fine.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.741
Sorry.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.245
Look, I'm telling you
the truth,

11:43.245 --> 11:44.746
you really couldn't
get Ally on the phone,

11:44.788 --> 11:45.747
it's all texting with her.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.250
Well, what do you want my DNA?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.751
You want me to pee into a cup?
You want my underwear?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.295
Whatever you want, you got it,

11:51.336 --> 11:52.754
'cause I didn't kill Ally.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.755
I'll tell you what I want.

11:53.797 --> 11:54.756
I want you to write down

11:55.257 --> 11:56.258
exactly where you were
last night and when.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.267
Paint scrapings

12:05.267 --> 12:06.768
from your vic's bu
mper are consistent

12:06.810 --> 12:08.770
with a '91 to
'96 blue Ford.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.773
So that narrows it down
to a few thousand cars

12:11.815 --> 12:13.775
in the greater
Las Vegas area.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.279
Yeah, but the car you're looki
ng for is also a piece of crap.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.780
Make and model I get,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.282
but unless you have
a new test

12:20.782 --> 12:22.284
that quantifies
"crappiness"..

12:22.784 --> 12:23.285
Actually, take a look.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.791
Silver Firebird's on the left,
blue Ford on the right.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.586
What's the gray-blue
in the middle?

12:32.628 --> 12:34.963
A mixture of Rustoleum
and house paint.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.299
The killer's car had
exposed primer.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.300
Swanky.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.806
Might have found a few letters
from the license plate.

12:44.848 --> 12:45.807
"Y-K-A."

12:46.308 --> 12:46.808
You found a witness?

12:47.309 --> 12:47.809
No.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.311
Just behavior.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.812
But according to
Ally Sullivan's father,

12:50.812 --> 12:52.814
she was the type of girl
that might have noticed

12:52.856 --> 12:54.816
the license plate
of the car that hit her.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.818
And according
to her good friend,

12:56.860 --> 12:57.819
she preferred

12:57.819 --> 13:00.822
text messaging
to leaving voice messages.

13:00.864 --> 13:01.823
She was dying, right?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.325
Disoriented?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.827
I don't know, but maybe
she thought she was texting

13:05.869 --> 13:07.329
when in fact she was
just dialing the phone.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.842
That's a bit of a long shot.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.844
Yeah.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.845
It's still a shot.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.354
Good evening.
I'm Paula Francis.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.856
A weekend of sordid crimes has

13:33.856 --> 13:35.607
Las Vegas Police
working double-time.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.359
At the same time,
the police union is

13:37.401 --> 13:38.652
arguing for more pay.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.862
They say they're doing

13:39.862 --> 13:42.364
all they can to protect
residents, but the pay scale...

13:42.406 --> 13:44.366
Yeah, yeah, okay.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.368
Joey? Joey?

13:46.410 --> 13:47.870
Hey.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.372
You don't hit on a cocktail
waitressatthe bar.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.875
Go sit at a table,
then she's got a reason

13:52.875 --> 13:54.877
to come over and serve you,
and it's less obvious.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.879
Hold on. Wait, wait.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.881
The househusband's giving
me tips on women?

13:58.922 --> 14:01.383
I married a cocktail waitress.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.385
Janice cocktailed?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.387
This crappy little joint
in Cleveland.

14:05.429 --> 14:06.388
Really?
Mm-hmm.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.390
I'm not looking
to marry this broad.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.392
Although, she might think so.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.393
At least for tonight.

14:11.435 --> 14:12.895
Ah.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.897
Joey, you're, like,
40-something, right?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.899
Shouldn't you be toning
it down a little?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.400
Tone it down?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.402
Karl, I'm looking
to take it up a notch.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.404
I got, like, ten more years of fun left

14:22.446 --> 14:24.406
and my wingman's
got a curfew.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.407
No

14:25.407 --> 14:27.910
Why'd you bail out
so early last night?

14:28.410 --> 14:30.162
I missed my family.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.914
That's so sweet.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.416
You should work
for Hallmark.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.919
I'll send them my resume

14:36.919 --> 14:41.924
It wasn't the smell that got
my attention, you know?

14:41.965 --> 14:44.426
Usually when I find a body,

14:44.426 --> 14:50.933
it's, uh, it's very,
um, raunchy.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.936
It's called "decomp,"
in case you're interested.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.938
I'll remember
that for next time.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.941
If it wasn't the smell,
why did you check the room?

14:58.982 --> 15:01.944
Rent is due
every week

15:02.444 --> 15:04.446
What's his name?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.448
We ask for cash, not names.

15:08.450 --> 15:12.454
We take who the casinos won't.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.956
Someone's got to do it.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.457
Did you touch or move anything?

15:15.457 --> 15:17.459
First thing I di d was call you guys.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.461
Got you on speed dial.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.463
And finally, in local crime,

15:21.463 --> 15:23.966
an update on yesterday's tragic death

15:24.007 --> 15:26.468
of Vegas party girl
Ally Sullivan.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.970
Police are still examining
all the evidence

15:28.470 --> 15:29.972
from the gruesome crime scene.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.975
Detectives tell Eyewitness News
they have little to work with.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.977
And something that stumps them:

15:35.477 --> 15:36.979
What was the motive
for the killer

15:36.979 --> 15:39.982
in this violent end
to a young and beautiful life?

15:40.023 --> 15:40.983
Mr. Sullivan,

15:41.483 --> 15:42.484
when was the last ti
me you saw her alive?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.486
What are you people thinking?

15:44.486 --> 15:46.989
Think I'm going to say
something magical,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.992
bring Ally back to me?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.994
I'm not talking to you people.

15:52.494 --> 15:53.996
Mr. Sullivan, what was
your daughter doing

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
in that section of town? You
think it was drug-relate d?

15:55.998 --> 15:58.250
Police are hoping passersby
or other eyewitnesses

15:58.292 --> 16:00.502
will come forward
to help in the investigation

16:00.544 --> 16:02.004
of this terrible murder.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.007
If you have information
that might help police,

16:05.048 --> 16:08.010
you are urged to call
LVPD at the toll-free number

16:08.051 --> 16:09.011
on the screen.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.272
Control, this is
Detective Curtis.

16:20.314 --> 16:23.025
I'm at 1773 Twain,
Riviera Suites.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.528
I got a 419. I need CSI.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.992
You know, I think

16:32.034 --> 16:34.036
I've been called out
to this place before.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.038
I think I've processed
this very room before.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.540
Liver temp is close to ambient.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.046
But lividity is fixed.

16:46.048 --> 16:50.010
And rigidity starting to pass.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.554
So he's been dead
for at least 20 hours.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.530
".380 Auto. "

17:09.570 --> 17:11.823
That's Federal ammo.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.034
.380s make a lot of noise.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.078
It's odd that no one heard anything,

17:16.118 --> 17:18.079
even in a dump like this.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.082
"Walther PPK."

17:23.085 --> 17:25.337
Two shots in the body,
one to the head.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.589
Sounds like
a professional hit to me.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.093
Looks like the killer used
Armor All.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.594
The gun is clean.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.096
Looks like the victim
was doing

17:34.137 --> 17:35.097
a little cleaning of his own.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.598
He was a 12 Stepper.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.603
Trying to make amends.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.857
He was on step number nine.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.568
Apparently
not enough.

17:47.609 --> 17:51.113
Well, it's pretty obvious that
he came in through the window.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.078
Whew. One thing's for sure,

17:58.120 --> 18:01.623
this killer's lugging arou
nd some pretty big dogs.

18:46.168 --> 18:50.672
Oh. Hey, Grissom,
I just I.D.'d those fibers

18:50.714 --> 18:53.175
you found
on Ally Sullivan's necklace.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.928
They were not from
her jacket or her dress.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.180
They're made of lambskin
and rabbit fur.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.431
You know, just between
you and me,

18:59.473 --> 19:00.682
I used to carry
a rabbit's foot.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.142
I mean,
I'm not superstitious.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.144
It's just, I figure
why take the chance?

19:04.186 --> 19:07.689
You know, as a kid, my grandfather
used to have a rabbit farm.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.194
Is this our Ford Taurus?

19:12.694 --> 19:14.154
Once upon a time.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.156
Told you it was
a piece of crap.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
The vehicle was abando
ned near a junkyard

19:18.242 --> 19:20.160
off Boulder Highway.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.203
By the time they checked
the plates,

19:21.703 --> 19:23.205
it was already in the crusher.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.708
Plates and paint are a match
to your BOLO.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.171
Did Brass run those tags?

19:31.213 --> 19:35.217
Yeah, it was last registered
to a Betty Grinly in Henderson.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.219
She passed away last month.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.223
Gasoline. They torched it.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.691
So he burns the evidence
near a junkyard

19:50.732 --> 19:53.735
so that they'll find it
and dispose of it. Clever.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.737
Looks like we're dealing
with a professional.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.197
Professional what, though?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.241
Ally Sullivan was killed
over a fender bender.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.701
You're right.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.244
He probably just
loved his car

20:02.286 --> 20:03.745
and has a really
bad temper.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.754
And he likes pineapples.

20:16.258 --> 20:21.263
Ah, yeah, I remember
that Taurus.

20:21.305 --> 20:22.723
Cheap and reliable.

20:22.764 --> 20:23.765
That combo always sells.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.269
Could you give me a description
of the person who bought it?

20:27.311 --> 20:30.272
Honey, I'm not even sure
I can tell what you look like.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.773
All I remember is

20:31.815 --> 20:33.275
he came off the bus...

20:35.277 --> 20:38.780
he walked right up
with a big wad of cash.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.241
I put him in that Taurus,

20:41.283 --> 20:43.785
and 15 minutes later,
he drove off the lot.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.288
Did you get
a transaction record?

20:46.788 --> 20:50.792
Let's see. Taurus, Taurus,
Taurus, Taurus...

20:51.293 --> 20:53.295
Ah, here you go.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.801
This is for a '99 Jeep Cherokee.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.308
It sure is.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.270
Um, hold it.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.313
It's over here.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.822
How's that one look?

21:20.864 --> 21:22.825
Not so great.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.379
The coroner's bullets
matched the Walther,

22:17.880 --> 22:20.132
but Bobby found
an additional striated mark

22:20.174 --> 22:21.758
on the O-jive,
so he went back to the gun.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.385
There was threading
inside the muzzle.

22:25.888 --> 22:27.389
Killer used a silencer.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.403
Slightest imperfection
in the barrel

22:41.445 --> 22:43.405
of a silencer could explain

22:43.906 --> 22:45.365
these scratches on the bullet.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.910
Oh. Also explains
why no one heard anything.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.870
But.

22:49.912 --> 22:51.872
leave the gun,
take the silencer?

22:51.914 --> 22:53.916
Well, you can't legally
buy a silencer,

22:53.957 --> 22:54.917
and those things are hard
to make.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.419
If the silencer was homemade,
we might have been able

22:57.461 --> 22:58.921
to match the killer's
tool marks.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.881
Assuming we ever find this guy.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.925
I don't know who would go
to this much trouble

23:02.966 --> 23:04.885
to kill a nobody like Nash.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.929
Well, he was a somebody
to the killer.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.957
Hey, people, Amanda Congdon
from rocketboom. com

23:34.998 --> 23:36.708
with this week's creep report.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.460
If you were planning on
checking out

23:38.961 --> 23:40.963
that new club, Bubbles,
down near Harmon and Twain,

23:41.463 --> 23:43.423
you might want to think twice,

23:43.465 --> 23:46.218
because the corpses are really
piling up down there.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.971
The body of Clayton Nash was
found just two blocks away

23:49.012 --> 23:50.973
from the site of Ally
Sullivan's murder,

23:51.014 --> 23:53.976
and the killer's
still at large.

23:54.017 --> 23:57.020
Is this just another
crime spree,

23:57.062 --> 23:59.982
or the work
of one deranged maniac?

24:00.023 --> 24:00.983
Don't ask the cops.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.484
They don't have a clue.

24:02.985 --> 24:06.989
Remember, Amanda warned you.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.448
Carl?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.449
Mm
What are you doing?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.993
Oh Not even ready for dinner.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.452
I was checking
our stocks.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.496
Well, you're not wearing that
to the Eiffel Tower.

24:14.538 --> 24:16.456
I'll throw some clothes on

24:16.498 --> 24:18.500
Hurry up. My mom's waiting
for Maddy.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.002
I don't want
to lose that table.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.004
Two seconds.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.965
Okay.

24:25.007 --> 24:27.009
Well, now, who's that
beautiful girl, huh?

25:47.089 --> 25:48.340
So, you drive
Route 107 Southbound

25:48.382 --> 25:49.591
during the week, is that right?

25:50.092 --> 25:51.051
6:00 a. m.
to 6:00 p. m.

25:51.093 --> 25:52.344
Yeah, I'm a
morning person

25:52.386 --> 25:53.554
Now, is there any chance,

25:53.595 --> 25:55.597
any chance at all,
that you remember this guy?

25:55.639 --> 25:57.599
I know it's not
the best picture.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.560
Oh, yeah.

25:59.601 --> 26:03.063
I let him out on stop "E" around
4:30 day before yesterday.

26:03.105 --> 26:06.608
You know, you get hundreds of
people on and off your bus every day.

26:06.650 --> 26:09.111
We got to be sure-
are you sure you remember him?

26:09.152 --> 26:11.572
I look at every face
that steps on my ride.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.574
I saw the movieSpeed
- I'm not gonna be hijacked.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.118
Well, you know, actuallySpeed,
it... it wasn't hijacked,

26:16.160 --> 26:17.619
it was wired to explode.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.580
Whatever.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.624
Well, all right. What exactly
do you remember about him?

26:22.666 --> 26:24.626
He paid in cash,
told me to keep the change-

26:24.668 --> 26:26.086
everybody else uses a bus pass.

26:26.128 --> 26:28.630
He was a real gentleman-
tucked-in shirt,

26:28.672 --> 26:30.382
new shoes...

26:30.424 --> 26:32.092
Nice smell.

26:32.134 --> 26:34.595
Kind of stands out
on my route.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.389
So I guess you remember
where you picked him up, then?

26:37.431 --> 26:40.142
He came walking out of
the desert like Moses himself.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.144
So the bus driver said

26:42.186 --> 26:44.104
the guy got on here?

26:44.146 --> 26:46.106
You sure this is
a working stop?

26:46.148 --> 26:49.151
You know, the Cat bus stops here
59 times a day.

26:49.193 --> 26:51.153
For what?
Construction workers,

26:51.195 --> 26:52.654
hikers,

26:53.155 --> 26:54.114
migrants.

26:54.156 --> 26:55.616
se The name on the driver's licen

26:55.657 --> 26:58.619
is fake, but the
picture' s got to be real

26:58.660 --> 27:02.664
I'm gonna go... wave it
around the neighborhood.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.166
Okay.

27:06.168 --> 27:08.170
Assuming our guy's
not from around here,

27:08.212 --> 27:10.422
how'd he get here?

27:10.464 --> 27:12.674
The same way they did.

27:35.197 --> 27:37.199
Every time I come
to the desert,

27:37.241 --> 27:39.159
I see porno mags.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.453
Who brings spankables out here?

27:41.495 --> 27:43.705
It's probably just trash

27:44.206 --> 27:45.707
blown in from off the street.

27:45.749 --> 27:48.460
Nobody throws away porn.

27:48.502 --> 27:51.171
They're like heirlooms.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.714
Passed on down
the family tree.

28:01.223 --> 28:03.183
Hey, Greg.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.226
Come here and check this out.

28:06.228 --> 28:09.690
A single set of ATV tracks
goes off the trail

28:09.731 --> 28:12.234
back there into here
- killer could've dumped the ATV

28:12.276 --> 28:13.735
and then got on the bus.

28:20.742 --> 28:24.746
Whoever was here
had some big shoes.

28:30.252 --> 28:32.754
Not necessarily big feet.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.756
Multiple socks.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.258
Another precaution
to cover your tracks.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.766
Assuming it's our guy.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.226
I'd say

28:46.268 --> 28:47.769
it's our guy.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.772
And I think he just
gave us the finger.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.041
I have an update for you.

29:09.082 --> 29:11.585
The burned gloves
that Nick submitted

29:11.627 --> 29:13.879
are lambskin
lined with rabbit's fur.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.089
They're consistent
with the fibers found

29:16.131 --> 29:18.091
in Ally Sullivan's
necklace.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.551
Good.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.595
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

29:50.123 --> 29:54.127
I'm guessing
that Clayton Nash had a record.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.587
1985, aidi ng and abetting,

29:55.629 --> 29:58.090
extortion in '87,
armed robbery in '92,

29:58.131 --> 30:00.634
assault in '95, uh, loan
shark ing the same year.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.136
I get the drift.
But, uh,

30:03.637 --> 30:05.138
take a look at this-
- it's FBI surveillance.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.602
What is this, summer
camp? Well, not the kind

30:10.644 --> 30:13.146
you want to send your kid to-
they're bank robbers.

30:13.188 --> 30:16.149
All of them? Apparently,
Nash and his buddies

30:16.650 --> 30:17.609
would get together every year,

30:17.651 --> 30:20.904
talk shop, hire hookers,
play flag football.

30:20.946 --> 30:24.158
Nash did mostly grunt
work- driver, lookout

30:24.658 --> 30:25.617
Never handled the cash.

30:25.659 --> 30:28.662
He got busted
in an armored car heist

30:28.704 --> 30:31.123
in Ohio ten years ago.

30:31.165 --> 30:33.667
Testified against practically
everyone he'd ever worked with

30:34.168 --> 30:35.127
Well, that certainly explains

30:35.169 --> 30:36.920
why someone would want
to kill him.

30:36.962 --> 30:38.672
Most of those people
in the picture

30:38.714 --> 30:39.673
are either dead or in prison.

30:39.715 --> 30:41.133
Who isn't?

30:41.175 --> 30:42.176
Give me a Heine, please.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.136
What is that?

30:44.178 --> 30:46.180
Anybody should be drinking
water, it's me, let me tell ya.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.639
Really blasted my quads.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.683
Let's do shooters.
Wanna?

30:51.685 --> 30:54.688
Let's pretend...
that you're wearing a suit,

30:55.189 --> 30:57.149
and let's pretend
we're inyouroffice,

30:57.191 --> 31:01.195
and let's pretend I ju st cut
you a big check for your services

31:01.236 --> 31:03.697
because you are st
ill my damn lawyer.

31:04.198 --> 31:05.699
All right, man, all right,
I'm listening.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.701
There's some stuff I need.

31:07.743 --> 31:09.703
No particular order.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.707
Credit card blanks?

31:14.208 --> 31:16.210
DMV license blanks?
What is this?

31:16.251 --> 31:17.711
No questions.

31:19.213 --> 31:20.672
Laminating machine,
blank bar code labels.

31:20.714 --> 31:24.218
What are you doing? What makes you
think I can even get this stuff?

31:24.259 --> 31:26.220
I know the guy
s you represent.

31:26.261 --> 31:28.263
I'm one of 'em.

31:28.305 --> 31:29.765
I need the stuff fast.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.225
Don't let me down.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.771
There was no reason
to connect the two murders

32:17.813 --> 32:19.314
until ballistics
matched the silencer

32:19.314 --> 32:20.816
we found in the desert
with the gun

32:20.858 --> 32:22.276
you found
at the Riviera Suites.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.777
Two murders, same killer.

32:24.278 --> 32:25.279
Here's how we th
ink things went down.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.781
The killer drove his
ATV into the desert,

32:27.823 --> 32:29.241
sh, concealed it in the bru

32:29.283 --> 32:32.786
takes a bus to a used car
lot and buys a blue Taurus

32:32.828 --> 32:34.788
Then he drives
to the apartment,

32:34.830 --> 32:36.790
puts a cap in Clayton Nash,

32:37.291 --> 32:39.793
gets into his car
and drives away, free and clear.

32:40.294 --> 32:41.795
It's a good plan, well executed.

32:41.837 --> 32:43.255
Yeah, right up until the point

32:43.297 --> 32:44.798
that Ally Sullivan
smashed into his car.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.092
Collateral damage-
he killed her

32:47.134 --> 32:49.219
so she couldn't
identify him.

32:49.261 --> 32:51.305
Okay, that all sounds great.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.265
How do we find the guy?

32:53.307 --> 32:54.766
We know his original target,
Clayton Nash.

32:54.808 --> 32:58.312
Small-time hood who gave up
a lot of his big-time cronies.

32:58.353 --> 33:00.272
He's got a list of enemies

33:00.314 --> 33:02.316
How many guys got convicted
off Nash's testimony?

33:02.816 --> 33:03.817
Seven.

33:04.318 --> 33:06.069
Three of them
are still in prison.

33:06.111 --> 33:07.779
One is dead,
one is out on parole,

33:07.821 --> 33:10.324
and two served their time
and are now out.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.284
So we have
three potential killers

33:12.326 --> 33:14.328
and nothing to tie them
to either crime scene.

33:14.369 --> 33:15.787
Not quite.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.831
I ruled out most
of the prints

33:18.332 --> 33:19.791
from Ally Sullivan's car-

33:19.833 --> 33:21.793
the vic, the father,
her boyfriend-

33:21.835 --> 33:25.339
but there are a few
unidentified partials.

33:28.342 --> 33:29.843
It's not enough detail
to run through AFIS?

33:29.885 --> 33:30.802
Well, if this guy

33:30.844 --> 33:32.304
is a major case felon,

33:32.346 --> 33:34.097
then his prints are definitely
in the system.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.849
I dusted every inch
of that apartment window.

33:35.891 --> 33:36.850
He never took off his gloves.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.402
You going somewhere?

34:36.409 --> 34:37.870
The fake I.D. cards?!

34:37.911 --> 34:38.911
The staying out all night,

34:39.413 --> 34:41.915
and then this mysterious
ATV ride in the desert.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.917
You gave me the ATV
for my birthday.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.418
I ride it because I love you.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.920
Yeah, at 3:00 in the morning?

34:46.962 --> 34:48.172
Yeah.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.380
Uh-uh.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.924
You're planning a job.

34:50.966 --> 34:52.426
I'm not planning a job!

34:52.926 --> 34:54.428
You know
I don't do that anymore.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.889
You're a liar, Karl.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.433
You're lying! Honey, listen-
honey!

35:03.437 --> 35:05.439
Janice, look...

35:07.941 --> 35:09.443
I had to take care
of something.

35:09.943 --> 35:12.446
And what's that
supposed to mean?

35:12.488 --> 35:15.949
I killed Clayton Nash.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.455
You even think about Maddy?

35:21.497 --> 35:23.457
Your daughter?

35:23.499 --> 35:25.417
You promised...

35:25.459 --> 35:26.960
on her life,
you promised!

35:27.002 --> 35:28.921
No more robberies!

35:28.962 --> 35:31.965
I don't do robberies any more.

35:32.007 --> 35:33.467
Now you just kill people.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.968
He was a rat.

35:35.469 --> 35:36.470
Oh, Karl.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.432
All the waiting.

35:40.474 --> 35:43.477
All the maneuvering,
the lying.

35:45.479 --> 35:48.440
I did it.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.984
And I did it for us,
for this family.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.445
I kept money in our wallets.

35:53.487 --> 35:58.492
I invested it, so all you had
to do was watch football on TV.

35:58.534 --> 36:00.452
And Nash was the reason.

36:00.494 --> 36:04.498
The reason that you had to hide
the money and live on the run.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.458
I never got caught

36:06.500 --> 36:07.501
And I never would've got caught,

36:08.001 --> 36:09.503
except for that...
that lousy junkie

36:09.545 --> 36:13.006
who gave me up.

36:13.507 --> 36:16.009
I only had one rule:
you never talk!

36:16.051 --> 36:17.970
And he talked.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.972
And you jeopardized
everything we have

36:20.013 --> 36:24.518
for some scumbag that
nobody gives a damn about.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.271
Janice, he called me
four weeks ago.

36:27.312 --> 36:28.897
He said,
"I'm in town for a while

36:28.939 --> 36:30.524
Maybe we could we get together. "

36:31.024 --> 36:32.025
He had something to tell me.

36:32.526 --> 36:34.027
Tell me what?

36:34.069 --> 36:35.487
"I'm sorry?

36:35.529 --> 36:39.533
I'm sorry I stole seven
years of your life. "

36:39.575 --> 36:43.537
I- I couldn't let it go.

36:48.041 --> 36:52.546
Oh, God, he had it coming.

36:54.047 --> 36:56.049
And you were
careful, right

36:59.553 --> 37:02.556
So what's with the fake I.D.s?

37:05.058 --> 37:07.019
Karl?

37:07.060 --> 37:09.062
You don't make mistakes.

37:11.565 --> 37:14.526
I didn't.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.069
Somebody else did.

37:18.572 --> 37:22.075
A girl named Ally Sullivan.

37:23.577 --> 37:27.581
The... The girl on the TV?

37:29.583 --> 37:31.084
Oh, Karl!

37:33.086 --> 37:35.839
Oh, God, she was just a kid!

37:35.881 --> 37:38.217
She crashed into my car

37:38.258 --> 37:40.552
right after I did Nash

37:40.594 --> 37:42.596
She was gonna call the cops.

37:43.096 --> 37:44.097
I had to do it

37:47.100 --> 37:49.102
I had to.

37:52.105 --> 37:54.107
I want you to go up the stairs.

37:54.608 --> 37:56.068
I want you to kiss Maddy.

37:56.109 --> 37:59.112
I want you to tell her
that you love her...

37:59.613 --> 38:01.114
and I want you to get out
of this house.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.077
Karl Cooper.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.620
At age 19, he was

38:06.662 --> 38:08.080
an Army Ranger

38:08.121 --> 38:11.124
By 42, he was one
of the most successful

38:11.166 --> 38:12.876
bank robbers
in U.S. history.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.628
He pulled off dozens
of heists,

38:14.670 --> 38:16.588
going back two decades,

38:16.630 --> 38:18.590
all without killing
a single person,

38:18.632 --> 38:23.136
and he was known to his
bank-robbin g buddies as "Red. "

38:23.178 --> 38:24.638
He doesn't have red hair

38:24.680 --> 38:26.098
Well, he got the nickname

38:26.139 --> 38:28.642
because he was always
in debt... "in the red. "

38:29.142 --> 38:30.644
Do we have In The Red's address?

38:30.686 --> 38:32.104
Last known

38:32.145 --> 38:34.147
was the U.S.
Federal Penitentiary

38:34.189 --> 38:35.399
in Marion, Illinois.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.025
When Nash gave him up,

38:37.067 --> 38:38.610
Cooper plead guilty.

38:38.652 --> 38:40.112
He served the fu
ll seven years term

38:40.154 --> 38:42.156
He got out, dropped of
f the face of the earth.

39:03.177 --> 39:05.679
The tire model

39:06.180 --> 39:08.140
is a Dunlop KT-345

39:08.182 --> 39:09.641
I checked with the local dealers.

39:09.683 --> 39:12.186
The only ATV that uses
that particular type of tire

39:12.227 --> 39:14.188
has only been on the market
for about a year.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.939
It's called the Yamaha Raptor.

39:15.981 --> 39:17.649
So I got the
list of the names

39:17.691 --> 39:19.693
of everybody in Las Vegas
 who's recently bought one.

39:20.194 --> 39:23.947
The only Cooper on the
list is female- Janice.

39:23.989 --> 39:27.701
Well, Karl Cooper had
a girlfriend back in Ohio,

39:27.743 --> 39:29.203
a Janice Hanford.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.205
I mean, she
could be Cooper now.

39:31.246 --> 39:32.206
Do we have her address?

39:32.706 --> 39:37.711
Yeah. It's,
uh, second page.

39:38.212 --> 39:40.214
I think you
broke the case, Nick.

39:52.726 --> 39:54.728
Maddy...

39:55.229 --> 39:57.231
Sweetie, come with me, okay?

39:58.232 --> 39:59.233
Las Vegas police.
Open up!

40:05.739 --> 40:06.740
Janice Cooper?

40:06.782 --> 40:07.741
Yeah.

40:08.242 --> 40:08.742
We're looking for
your husband.

40:09.243 --> 40:09.743
He's not here.

40:10.244 --> 40:11.203
Don't take it personally,

40:11.245 --> 40:12.746
but I'm not going
to take your word for that.

40:12.788 --> 40:14.206
You guys never do.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.707
Look around all you like.

40:15.749 --> 40:17.251
Please step outside
with the child.

40:17.292 --> 40:18.752
It's for your own safety.

40:18.794 --> 40:20.254
Like I said, he's not here.

40:58.292 --> 41:00.294
Mommy doesn't like you.

41:00.794 --> 41:02.296
Really? Well, that's too bad

41:02.337 --> 41:03.255
She hardly even knows me.

41:03.297 --> 41:05.299
Maddy, you
be nice, baby, okay?

41:05.340 --> 41:07.301
Definitely. Let's all be nice.

41:07.801 --> 41:08.760
Jim...

41:08.802 --> 41:10.262
ATV has the right tires

41:10.304 --> 41:12.306
and there are plenty
of machine tools

41:12.347 --> 41:14.308
and parts back there
to build a silencer.

41:14.349 --> 41:17.269
Where's Karl.
Go to hell.

41:17.311 --> 41:18.770
All right. Here's the way it is.

41:18.812 --> 41:20.814
You're going to jail,
she's going to Child Services.

41:20.856 --> 41:22.816
End of story. I've had cops
in my face for half my life.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.818
You don't scare me.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.822
Well, maybe that's
your lawyer now.

41:28.864 --> 41:30.282
Hello?

41:30.324 --> 41:34.328
Just answer yes or no-
are the cops there?

41:34.369 --> 41:36.330
Yes.

41:37.831 --> 41:40.334
Are they threatening
to take Maddy?

41:40.375 --> 41:43.795
Yes.

41:43.837 --> 41:48.842
That's what happens
when you marry a crook.

41:50.844 --> 41:52.846
I think they're
tracing this call.

41:52.888 --> 41:53.847
I'll take that phone.

42:19.873 --> 42:20.874
Hey, Officer.

42:20.916 --> 42:23.877
Yup?

42:24.378 --> 42:26.380
I'm going to make your day.

42:48.902 --> 42:51.405
Uncuff him,
will you, Mitch?

42:56.910 --> 42:59.413
Karl. Don't do
anything stupid.

43:01.915 --> 43:04.418
Palms out, please.

43:04.459 --> 43:06.920
I know the drill.

43:13.927 --> 43:15.387
So, tell me...

43:15.429 --> 43:18.182
where'd I go wrong?

43:18.223 --> 43:20.934
You killed two people.

43:21.305 --> 43:27.219
