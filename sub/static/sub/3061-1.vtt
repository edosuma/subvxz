00:52.514 --> 00:55.765
<i>During the 1620s, Wei Zhongxian, 
Head Eunuch and Head of the Imperial Assassins...</i>

00:55.865 --> 00:58.824
<i>had been having his way in the Imperial
Court for eight years.</i>

00:59.311 --> 01:01.825
<i>At that time, seven out of ten 
Court Officials...</i>

01:01.825 --> 01:04.802
<i>were Wei's followers,
known as "the Eunuch's Clique".</i>

01:06.189 --> 01:08.249
<i>When Emperor Chongzhen 
came into power,</i>

01:08.249 --> 01:11.648
<i>he relieved Wei of all duties and sent
him to the remote outpost of Fengyang.</i>

01:12.039 --> 01:14.305
<i>Although Wei had fallen, 
the Clique was still there.</i>

01:14.405 --> 01:18.052
<i>Chongzhen wanted every member of 
the Clique arrested.</i>

01:19.205 --> 01:21.192
It sure is cold, Master Ma.

01:21.292 --> 01:23.049
A nice bowl of noodles would warm us up,

01:23.049 --> 01:24.226
wouldn't it?

01:24.226 --> 01:25.733
Noodles ...

01:26.491 --> 01:27.847
at this hour,

01:28.139 --> 01:30.187
only two kinds of people are outside...

01:30.222 --> 01:31.781
besides the night watchmen.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.485
There's us,

01:34.142 --> 01:35.683
sent by rotten luck...

01:35.683 --> 01:37.341
to patrol the grounds.

01:39.096 --> 01:40.440
And then there's ...

01:41.987 --> 01:43.926
What did you see?

01:48.411 --> 01:50.265
Get out of there.

01:59.973 --> 02:01.537
An Imperial Assassin!

02:02.590 --> 02:03.669
What's wrong?

02:03.758 --> 02:05.486
Lets get out of here. Come.

02:08.561 --> 02:13.090
<i>[ The Imperial assassins are arresting 
the Eunuch Clique member Xu Xianchun. ]</i>

02:19.017 --> 02:20.317
5 o'clock ... remember 5 o'clock.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.478
Take Xianchun with you to Xizhimen,

02:23.900 --> 02:25.403
and take this letter to Sir Cao.

02:25.403 --> 02:26.974
You will leave the city in the water cart.

02:27.025 --> 02:28.337
I'll remember that.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.650
What is all this?
Why aren't you dressed properly?

02:34.281 --> 02:36.697
Sister- in- law, what's the matter?

02:39.718 --> 02:41.030
Sir Chen!

02:41.332 --> 02:43.127
I'm from the North Zhenfu Division.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.606
My name is Shen Lian.

02:50.098 --> 02:52.349
Please don't be alarmed.
- I'm not alarmed!

02:53.017 --> 02:55.212
Sir Shen,
even Imperial Assassins...

02:55.217 --> 02:56.700
need an explanation...

02:56.849 --> 02:58.342
for storming my residence.

02:58.342 --> 02:59.691
You know perfectly well...

02:59.789 --> 03:01.437
why I'm here!

03:45.278 --> 03:47.396
Sir Chen,
he only has one arm left.

03:48.715 --> 03:50.227
Do you want him to keep it?

03:52.369 --> 03:53.923
You know what I want.

03:59.132 --> 04:00.484
Arrest me then.

04:00.947 --> 04:02.461
I know your methods!

04:02.689 --> 04:04.327
I can handle the tortures.

04:19.014 --> 04:21.075
Leave my daughter alone ...
she's only 14!

04:21.175 --> 04:24.462
Leave my daughter alone, she's only 14!

04:27.581 --> 04:29.528
If she ends up as a courtesan
at the Academy,

04:29.697 --> 04:32.279
it will be because ...
you harbored a member of the Clique.

04:40.032 --> 04:42.460
Where is Xu Xianchun?
Tell me ...

04:42.495 --> 04:44.060
and I'll leave.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.947
Never to return!

05:02.578 --> 05:03.983
Go!

05:19.314 --> 05:21.527
Sir Chen,
if you do me a favor...

05:21.718 --> 05:23.746
no one in your family gets hurt!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.009
Sir Xu ...

05:40.289 --> 05:41.787
please come with us.

06:28.854 --> 06:30.598
Run Sir.
We'll take care of him.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.304
Lui Jianxing,
I know why you're doing this ...

06:52.339 --> 06:54.859
It's because I didn't promote you 
to the rank of Baihu.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.191
Lui Jianxing, let me go!

06:57.291 --> 06:59.236
If you do, I promise I'll promote you.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.451
Lian!
- Yichuan.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.019
Even Wei Zhongxian is down,

07:10.054 --> 07:12.769
and this ex-Commander is still
so high and mighty.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.504
Jianxing ...
the roots of the Clique run deep!

07:17.700 --> 07:19.478
Those bastards higher up...

07:19.546 --> 07:21.358
only remember the three of us...

07:21.358 --> 07:23.672
when there is a tricky mission like this.

07:24.119 --> 07:27.168
You're right,
but I'm afraid it's just our lot...

07:27.486 --> 07:29.598
to deal with this kind of business.

07:36.168 --> 07:37.485
Hey, Lian ...

07:39.362 --> 07:40.880
Listen ...

07:47.480 --> 07:48.757
I get it.

07:49.824 --> 07:51.860
Yichuan ...

07:52.060 --> 07:53.952
you can not go on like this forever.

08:02.617 --> 08:04.566
<i>My good sir, it's getting late.</i>

08:04.666 --> 08:06.220
<i>Why don't you come back tomorrow?</i>

08:06.220 --> 08:08.412
<i>You bitch.
How dare you disrespect me!</i>

08:08.697 --> 08:10.403
<i>Even if I have to pay double the price...</i>

08:10.403 --> 08:12.663
<i>I will still bed Zhou Miaotong today!</i>

08:21.587 --> 08:23.168
Come to bed.

08:23.439 --> 08:24.923
I have to go to work soon.

08:29.953 --> 08:31.556
You're an interesting character.

08:34.946 --> 08:36.676
Of all our customers...

08:37.173 --> 08:38.908
you're the only one who pays...

08:39.595 --> 08:41.729
but doesn't come to bed.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.199
I'm happy to sit here.

08:49.710 --> 08:53.344
<i>Of all the houses ...
I picked yours tonight.</i>

08:53.839 --> 08:57.089
<i>Have that Zhou girl cleaned up 
and see me.</i>

08:58.548 --> 09:01.023
As soon as I've saved enough,
I'll buy your freedom!

09:04.345 --> 09:06.119
Please, Mr. Officer ...

09:07.078 --> 09:08.956
with your salary?

09:09.219 --> 09:10.699
You're joking!

09:10.902 --> 09:13.711
Besides, this is the brothel 
of the Academy.

09:14.599 --> 09:16.302
Without an official permission ...

09:16.587 --> 09:19.151
no one gets out!

09:21.187 --> 09:23.203
Sir Chen, I need a favor.

09:23.278 --> 09:24.998
I need you ...

09:25.095 --> 09:27.450
to help me release a courtesan from 
the Academy.

09:34.655 --> 09:37.189
It's morning already.
I have to go.

09:38.255 --> 09:40.368
Next time, don't bother to change.

09:44.119 --> 09:46.226
I thought you might not like the uniform.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.692
Everybody here knows...

09:49.253 --> 09:51.583
that you're Sir Shen of the 
Imperial Assassins.

10:20.606 --> 10:21.961
Xiu!

10:36.920 --> 10:38.543
What's the matter?

10:39.561 --> 10:41.501
Afraid your officer friends might see me?

10:43.951 --> 10:46.739
Don't worry, they're far away.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.698
Xiu,

10:49.898 --> 10:51.448
just take this...

10:51.581 --> 10:53.097
and go!

10:55.070 --> 10:56.963
It's better then nothing.

10:58.017 --> 11:00.622
This is the last time,
I don't want to see you again.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.189
You think this uniform turns you into
a respectable person?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.407
A thief will always be a thief.

11:08.766 --> 11:10.208
This secret of yours ...

11:10.288 --> 11:11.921
will keep me well-fed forever.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.657
Think I'm bluffing?

11:22.665 --> 11:26.218
I'll give you three days ...
to get together 100 silver taels.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.959
100 taels ...

11:28.545 --> 11:30.173
I make 20 taels a year.

11:30.447 --> 11:32.073
Where would I get a 100?

11:35.121 --> 11:36.650
Go peddle your ass.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.898
Quite a few high officials ...
who have a thing for pretty boys.

11:39.998 --> 11:41.450
With your looks,

11:41.550 --> 11:44.156
100 taels ...
would be a piece of cake.

12:07.922 --> 12:09.663
Trying to kill me again?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.671
I don't see what's so special about you...

12:15.771 --> 12:18.297
that made Master favor you over me.

12:19.127 --> 12:20.408
Three days ...

12:33.639 --> 12:36.350
Sir.
- Lui Jianxing, you're quite an early bird.

12:36.350 --> 12:39.269
I spent the night here after work yesterday.

12:40.158 --> 12:41.829
And Sir Xui ...

12:43.379 --> 12:44.801
Xui Xianchun is under custody?

12:45.448 --> 12:46.471
Yes!

12:46.513 --> 12:48.463
This is really thanks to your carefull
planning, Sir.

12:48.725 --> 12:52.189
All the credit should go to you ...
as I wrote in my report.

12:52.717 --> 12:54.127
Very well.

12:55.071 --> 12:56.726
It's to early for any work.

12:56.908 --> 12:58.241
Go get some rest.

13:02.017 --> 13:03.799
Anything else?
- Well ...

13:04.348 --> 13:06.609
actually we talked about it already.

13:07.038 --> 13:08.541
It's about my promotion.

13:08.973 --> 13:11.014
I knew you wouldn't be here for no reason!

13:11.114 --> 13:12.734
I still haven't heard back from anyone.

13:13.948 --> 13:17.068
Sir ...
I gave you silver for the bribes.

13:17.728 --> 13:19.337
I even gave you credit for last night!

13:19.337 --> 13:21.358
Lui Jianxing, 
you have some bloody nerve!

13:21.936 --> 13:24.817
In that case,
I want none of your credit...

13:24.917 --> 13:28.041
and you can stop pestering me about 
this promotion. - Sir!

13:29.823 --> 13:32.927
Apologies, sir.
I meant no offense. Please forgive me.

13:33.227 --> 13:35.009
It's just that my mother keeps asking...

13:35.009 --> 13:36.585
when I'll take over my father's position.

13:36.585 --> 13:37.818
That's enough!

13:38.159 --> 13:39.642
The silver you gave me...

13:39.642 --> 13:41.303
only goes as far as Sir Qianhu.

13:41.769 --> 13:43.799
Everyone needs to be bribed.

13:44.963 --> 13:47.970
Either ...
bring me more silver,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.000
or ...

13:50.098 --> 13:51.657
learn to be patient.

14:06.753 --> 14:09.617
Sir Zhao, - Sir Zhao ...

14:13.538 --> 14:15.533
Which one is Lui Jianxing?

14:22.433 --> 14:24.751
Do you know when Wei Zhongxian 
left the city?

14:25.498 --> 14:27.322
Your Excellency, 
the day before yesterday.

14:27.422 --> 14:28.979
If you leave now,

14:29.178 --> 14:30.986
when can you catch up with him?

14:33.560 --> 14:36.103
If the horses are fast,
in Fucheng County by midnight.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.207
Good. You three, go do that!

14:45.824 --> 14:47.447
Your Excellency?

14:49.598 --> 14:51.469
His Majesty wants Wei Zhongxian dead.

14:57.574 --> 14:58.818
Your Excellency,

14:58.864 --> 15:00.663
why the three of us?

15:04.519 --> 15:06.230
Look at how shabby you are.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.380
There's no way you're part of the Clique.

15:12.404 --> 15:14.340
Sir, Fucheng County is right ahead.

15:14.486 --> 15:16.798
Once we're inside guard the four gates.

15:16.598 --> 15:18.308
No one gets in or out.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.087
Split into teams.
Inspect all Inns, big or small.

15:23.077 --> 15:24.315
Get out!

15:24.315 --> 15:25.920
How dare you throw us out!

15:38.485 --> 15:40.365
Wei Zhongxian must be inside that Inn.

15:45.780 --> 15:47.316
Don't send out the signal.

15:47.316 --> 15:48.984
There's no way the three of us...

15:48.984 --> 15:50.639
can handle this on our own!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.940
With us three getting this mission...

15:52.940 --> 15:54.890
plenty of people must be jealous.

15:55.026 --> 15:56.688
Zhang Ying is not happy either.

15:57.203 --> 15:58.968
He might have placed moles 
among our men.

15:58.968 --> 16:00.648
If he wants to jeopardize this mission!

16:00.814 --> 16:02.507
Even our lives are at risk!

16:02.507 --> 16:03.753
Are you trying to make sure...

16:03.753 --> 16:05.697
that we get all the credit for this one?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.298
Think it through, I mean it!

16:09.684 --> 16:12.523
Lian ...
are you not fed up with this life?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.238
We have no silver and no connections.

16:14.238 --> 16:16.667
What we need is an opportunity,
an opportunity...

16:16.667 --> 16:18.238
to get on top!

16:21.848 --> 16:23.665
Yichuan, what do you think?

16:30.771 --> 16:33.158
It's so cold ...
Come sit by the fire.

17:35.192 --> 17:37.109
You lowlives have got some guts...

17:37.119 --> 17:38.942
making a scene here.

17:49.816 --> 17:51.415
Kill them.
- Lady ...

17:51.415 --> 17:52.853
they're Imperial Assassins!

17:52.853 --> 17:54.804
Only three of them,
nothing to be scared of.

17:55.511 --> 17:57.705
For each head ...
you get 10 taels of gold.

18:01.073 --> 18:02.346
Give it a try!

18:03.777 --> 18:05.126
Kill them.

18:17.671 --> 18:18.953
Block the gate!

18:47.725 --> 18:49.342
Get upstairs!
- Okay.

19:19.511 --> 19:21.176
Sir Wei ...

19:41.139 --> 19:45.799
Officer ...
even if you cut off my head,

19:47.597 --> 19:50.138
you still have plenty to deal with.

19:51.055 --> 19:53.641
What kind of trouble ...
could you possibly have?

19:55.659 --> 19:58.058
Why does that boy Chongzhan
want to kill me?

19:58.933 --> 20:00.778
Is it because I deserve to die?

20:06.096 --> 20:08.413
You underestimate His majesty.

20:10.402 --> 20:12.778
I was in power for eight years.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.550
Now, my power is gone.

20:14.650 --> 20:17.277
All that I have left is lots of money.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.588
Bandits and Manchurians
are harrassing the borders.

20:20.588 --> 20:22.221
What His Majesty needs is a fortune...

20:22.221 --> 20:25.763
to fund his armies ...
and he has his eyes on mine!

20:25.848 --> 20:28.872
If you don't bring him my money,
your trouble's only starting.

20:38.378 --> 20:39.627
If we kill you,

20:39.757 --> 20:41.604
we'll certainly bring back your money.

20:45.428 --> 20:46.853
It isn't here.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.680
400 taels of gold.

21:05.586 --> 21:07.157
Open the door.

21:22.222 --> 21:24.491
How much do you make a year?

21:25.139 --> 21:26.817
A handful of this is worth...

21:27.034 --> 21:28.843
30 years of your salary.

21:29.471 --> 21:31.641
Let me live,
and it's all yours.

21:32.236 --> 21:33.888
This money will get me killed.

21:34.171 --> 21:35.784
If you kill me ...

21:36.330 --> 21:38.685
my followers
will hunt you down one by one.

21:38.785 --> 21:40.918
Don't even dream of saving your skins.

21:41.866 --> 21:43.359
This money here ...

21:43.359 --> 21:44.703
take it and you die.

21:44.899 --> 21:46.677
Don't take it, you die aswell.

21:46.677 --> 21:48.386
Why don't you take a change...

21:48.386 --> 21:50.083
Sir Shen!

21:53.277 --> 21:54.570
You know me?

21:56.720 --> 21:58.443
I was head of the Secret Police,

21:58.443 --> 22:00.359
we kept an eye on everyone!

22:00.359 --> 22:03.692
From the commanders
to the petty officers.

22:04.358 --> 22:05.952
I know every one of you.

22:08.303 --> 22:09.842
Go, kill them.

22:15.617 --> 22:18.748
Make a deal with me,
and I'll tell you where the money is.

22:18.848 --> 22:20.917
Bring it back,
and your mission will be a succes.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.514
<i>Lian! Lian!</i>

22:22.614 --> 22:24.122
<i>Jianxing, watch out!</i>

22:24.795 --> 22:26.376
Make up your mind.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.244
Or your two friends want last much longer.

22:30.229 --> 22:33.447
This ... all yours ...
all yours ...

22:41.173 --> 22:42.742
Who sent you?

22:44.151 --> 22:45.733
He's nothing but a pawn,

22:47.183 --> 22:48.747
just like you.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.451
Lady, it's on fire upstairs.
- Go upstairs!

23:02.451 --> 23:04.658
Wei Zhongxian is dead.

23:04.811 --> 23:07.458
The Eunuch is dead, drop your weapons!

23:34.524 --> 23:36.448
Your Excellency.

23:36.857 --> 23:38.531
Let me introduce the new Grand
Secretary of Cabinet.

23:38.531 --> 23:39.871
Sir Han Kuang.

23:39.871 --> 23:41.363
Greet him.

23:42.037 --> 23:43.601
Sir Han.

23:50.738 --> 23:52.867
So this is ...
Wei the Eunuch?

23:53.031 --> 23:54.597
Yes, sir.
- Open it.

24:03.811 --> 24:06.974
It's so badly burnt.
How do I know it's really him?

24:07.539 --> 24:09.090
Here is his tablet.

24:16.369 --> 24:18.548
How did he die?
- He set himself on fire.

24:18.548 --> 24:21.098
Did you see him do it with your own eyes?
- Yes.

24:21.098 --> 24:22.843
Then why didn't you stop him?

24:27.357 --> 24:29.378
His Majesty wants the Eunuch himself,

24:30.462 --> 24:32.156
and you brought back a pile of ashes.

24:32.156 --> 24:35.040
This tablet is 
no evidence enough that it's him!

24:35.929 --> 24:38.272
You don't even convince me,
let alone His Majesty.

24:39.090 --> 24:40.470
Sir Han,

24:40.702 --> 24:42.424
what are you saying?

24:42.985 --> 24:44.288
You think...

24:44.288 --> 24:46.031
these three Imperial Assassins...

24:46.131 --> 24:48.422
brought back the corpse 
of someone else?

24:48.717 --> 24:50.951
Sir, we would never dare.

25:05.057 --> 25:07.584
If you ask me,
this is Wei himself.

25:08.078 --> 25:11.604
Dozens of Assassins
saw him burning to death.

25:12.597 --> 25:14.655
Who would have the guts...

25:15.365 --> 25:17.463
to play tricks under everyone's nose?

25:17.509 --> 25:19.363
It would have been suicidal.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.739
Sir Zhao,

25:22.457 --> 25:24.239
His Majesty is young ...

25:24.274 --> 25:25.844
but very shrewd.

25:25.844 --> 25:27.681
When you're at His service,

25:28.041 --> 25:29.777
better be extra careful.

25:30.158 --> 25:32.442
If anything goes wrong, 
we all go down.

25:34.137 --> 25:36.576
Yes, Sir!
You're right, Sir Han.

25:37.518 --> 25:39.515
Thank you for standing up for us.

25:39.515 --> 25:41.227
We're more then grateful.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.752
It's fine, go get some rest.

25:44.662 --> 25:46.859
Good job, 
I'll put in a good word for you.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.214
Thank you, your Excellency.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.838
But next time you see Sir Han,

25:50.899 --> 25:52.239
don't be so presumptuous.

25:52.239 --> 25:53.972
You know very well...

25:54.046 --> 25:56.248
whether you really saw Wei or not.

25:56.683 --> 25:58.271
<i>Let's go.</i>

26:05.667 --> 26:07.384
Your lungs are straining.

26:07.384 --> 26:08.838
There's blood in your phlegm.

26:09.412 --> 26:12.321
Your skin is dry and your pulse is weak.

26:12.956 --> 26:14.221
Master Jin ...

26:14.221 --> 26:15.813
how is your sleep?

26:24.004 --> 26:26.139
Master Jin ...
- What?

26:26.827 --> 26:28.810
I'm asking about your sleep.

26:29.785 --> 26:31.763
I sweat a lot.
- I thought so.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.095
Just a second, Master Jin.

26:34.150 --> 26:35.670
I'll write you a prescription.

26:46.547 --> 26:48.330
My name is Jin.
Jin Ychuan.

26:49.383 --> 26:50.614
I know that.

26:50.614 --> 26:52.711
Sweetie, 
if you're done with all the work...

26:52.711 --> 26:54.285
come back in here.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.285
Okay.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.428
What is this?
- Musk, cloves, sandalwood...

27:07.428 --> 27:08.839
and borneol wrapped together.

27:08.839 --> 27:10.412
Keep it on you.

27:10.643 --> 27:12.532
It will help with your cough.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.450
Thank you.
- My name is Zhang Yan.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.044
Don't tell my father.

27:19.044 --> 27:21.511
He doesn't like it when I write
my own prescriptions.

27:22.279 --> 27:24.176
Yichuan ...
- Okay!

28:01.079 --> 28:03.326
Wei Ting, you've got some nerve.

28:03.543 --> 28:05.692
The entire country is hunting down
members of the Clique,

28:05.709 --> 28:07.893
and you dare return to the Capital.

28:08.182 --> 28:09.658
Jingzhong,

28:09.770 --> 28:12.579
look at how you veil your accusations.

28:14.128 --> 28:16.240
I see you've grown subtle.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.598
Godfather ...

28:20.791 --> 28:22.506
you're unharmed!

28:22.598 --> 28:24.299
I'm not dead,

28:24.722 --> 28:27.179
and yet you don't seem surprised.

28:27.493 --> 28:30.484
When I saw the corpse, 
I knew it wasn't you.

28:31.232 --> 28:32.763
So of course I'm not surprised.

28:38.423 --> 28:40.331
How are things at the Secret Police?

28:40.896 --> 28:42.525
His Majesty is having all documents...

28:42.665 --> 28:44.438
at the Secret Service examined.

28:45.318 --> 28:48.735
I think ...
he plans to close it up.

28:50.044 --> 28:53.324
The Secret Police 
has existed for almost 200 years.

28:54.143 --> 28:56.207
I didn't think it would end with my reign.

29:00.790 --> 29:03.743
You're heading the Secret Police now,
aren't you?

29:04.411 --> 29:05.940
You know everything.

29:06.249 --> 29:08.281
His Majesty ...
just appointed me.

29:09.693 --> 29:11.488
Special passes.
- Yes.

29:12.053 --> 29:13.998
You would need them on your way.

29:14.803 --> 29:16.700
You want to get rid of me.

29:17.138 --> 29:18.609
That's not what I meant!

29:26.749 --> 29:29.700
You recognized that corpse, 
didn't you?

29:30.586 --> 29:32.323
It was my servant.

29:32.487 --> 29:33.991
Ting found out that...

29:34.122 --> 29:35.847
his family name was also Zhao,

29:36.101 --> 29:37.850
and that you're from the same town.

29:39.851 --> 29:41.437
Godfather ...

29:42.435 --> 29:44.299
your men are no match for me.

29:44.299 --> 29:45.973
If a fight starts...

29:46.144 --> 29:47.922
we both lose.

29:55.719 --> 29:57.622
Don't you want to kill me?

29:59.558 --> 30:01.607
I thought you'd be more reckless.

30:07.798 --> 30:09.299
My son ...

30:10.678 --> 30:12.276
you want to kill me...

30:13.989 --> 30:15.978
because you don't want to get
dragged into this.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.058
Am I right?

30:22.015 --> 30:24.238
That Imperial Assassin knows I'm alive.

30:24.370 --> 30:26.135
Kill him for me.

30:28.464 --> 30:29.785
Godfather ...

30:29.785 --> 30:32.533
that Han Kuang is already suspicious.
If we act now...

30:34.079 --> 30:35.931
I'm afraid he'll leave no stone unturned.

30:35.931 --> 30:37.789
Kill Shen Lian,

30:39.568 --> 30:41.603
and I'll disappear.

30:44.558 --> 30:46.167
Only then,

30:46.989 --> 30:49.084
will you be truly safe.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.738
Miaotong ...

31:17.638 --> 31:19.271
with this money ...

31:20.861 --> 31:22.459
I can buy your freedom.

31:23.306 --> 31:24.919
We'll go to Suzhou,

31:26.622 --> 31:28.697
and you can have whatever you like.

31:30.382 --> 31:31.867
What do you say?

31:40.991 --> 31:42.877
<i>Miaotong ... hurry.</i>

31:42.977 --> 31:44.748
<i>Sir Shen has been waiting down there.</i>

31:45.478 --> 31:47.892
Madame, please offer him a few more drinks.

31:47.892 --> 31:49.308
My treat.

31:51.402 --> 31:52.834
Miaotong ...

31:54.238 --> 31:55.871
Why are you still here?

31:57.191 --> 31:59.360
I have ... a visitor.

32:01.530 --> 32:03.002
I can't bear to leave you.

32:03.957 --> 32:06.224
Whatever visitor that is,
I'll ask him to leave.

32:07.144 --> 32:09.946
That won't do,
he's an Imperial Assassin.

32:09.946 --> 32:11.789
I hate their bunch ...

32:12.246 --> 32:14.524
wearing Spring Blades bestowed 
by His Majesty,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.936
but always with innocent blood 
on their hands.

32:18.251 --> 32:19.836
<i>This one's different.</i>

32:20.053 --> 32:21.857
<i>He says he will...</i>

32:21.943 --> 32:23.789
<i>buy me freedom.</i>

32:25.051 --> 32:27.375
You care about him.
- No, silly.

32:28.149 --> 32:29.849
I'm not taking his money.

32:31.257 --> 32:32.895
I only wish...

32:32.918 --> 32:34.782
it was you who bought me freedom.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.118
<i>Miaotong, I've almost saved enough...</i>

32:37.118 --> 32:39.359
to take you away from here very soon.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.408
We'll go somewhere beautiful...

32:41.487 --> 32:43.017
and spend our life there.

33:08.457 --> 33:10.273
You two are really too much.

33:10.474 --> 33:11.998
Why are you still here?

33:12.209 --> 33:14.470
Madame Xue,
I did pay you for this.

33:14.799 --> 33:16.451
But ...

33:16.651 --> 33:18.261
Alright.

33:18.351 --> 33:19.932
You should go.

33:25.981 --> 33:27.945
Miaotong, Sir Shen is gone!

33:31.932 --> 33:35.837
<i>Miaotong, Sir Shen must never find 
out about you and young Master Yan.</i>

33:36.407 --> 33:38.123
<i>You don't want to displease...</i>

33:38.192 --> 33:40.231
<i>an Imperial Assassin.</i>

33:47.429 --> 33:49.227
Yichuan, try it on.

33:54.689 --> 33:56.329
Thank you.

33:58.129 --> 33:59.779
Lian is here.

34:01.503 --> 34:03.259
Lian.

34:04.301 --> 34:06.346
Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

34:09.118 --> 34:11.411
Did you go see Miss Zhou?

34:19.284 --> 34:21.510
Yichuan, that pretty thing you 
have on your belt,

34:21.918 --> 34:23.550
where did you get it?

34:23.620 --> 34:25.405
Come on, Lian.

34:26.001 --> 34:28.659
You were there, weren't you?

34:29.206 --> 34:30.918
You little bastard, tell me.

34:31.058 --> 34:32.741
Do you fancy the doctor's daughter?

34:32.741 --> 34:34.279
You went to see the doctor?

34:34.302 --> 34:35.770
What for?

34:54.367 --> 34:55.889
Watch out!

35:06.052 --> 35:07.387
Who were they?

35:08.378 --> 35:09.622
Hard to tell.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.324
Even on our way back here...

35:11.324 --> 35:12.764
we were being followed.

35:12.838 --> 35:14.391
We should all watch out.

35:14.391 --> 35:17.313
Maybe someone from the Clique 
wants to avenge Wei.

35:19.259 --> 35:21.957
If so ...
we can't stay in the capital.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.887
They see us but we don't see them.

35:24.949 --> 35:27.767
Jianxing, 
why don't we ask our superior...

35:28.009 --> 35:30.163
to transfer us to Nanjing?

35:31.848 --> 35:33.472
Nanjing?

35:34.084 --> 35:36.402
Lian, I've never seen you scared.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.200
What's wrong this time?

35:39.722 --> 35:41.178
Jianxing,

35:41.341 --> 35:43.694
for once, listen to me.
Alright?

35:44.803 --> 35:46.386
Wei Zhongxian...

35:46.856 --> 35:48.598
set himself on fire?
- Yes.

35:48.726 --> 35:50.178
He set himself on fire.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.780
If you leave ...

35:52.912 --> 35:54.498
what about Miss Zhou?

35:54.498 --> 35:56.289
I'll find a way to bring her along.

35:58.297 --> 35:59.658
You know very well...

35:59.825 --> 36:01.473
whether you saw Wei or not.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.309
I say ...

36:04.332 --> 36:06.279
let's stay put, 
and see how it goes.

36:06.334 --> 36:07.992
What do you think?

36:09.388 --> 36:11.396
I'll do whatever you two decide.
- Good.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.334
Jianxing ...
- Stop it.

36:36.075 --> 36:37.873
I told you not to act on your own!

36:38.598 --> 36:39.965
If it weren't for me...

36:40.079 --> 36:41.616
they would have caught you.

36:42.238 --> 36:43.963
Don't expect me to be grateful.

36:44.489 --> 36:45.808
Godfather told you...

36:45.831 --> 36:47.709
to do it as soon as possible.

36:53.818 --> 36:55.626
I have my plans.

36:57.754 --> 36:59.698
Do you know about Yan Peiwei?

36:59.786 --> 37:01.999
He's the Commander 
of the Imperial Court of Censors.

37:02.704 --> 37:04.249
Correct!

37:04.469 --> 37:06.450
He's also a member of the Golden Swords.

37:06.472 --> 37:08.662
Imperial Assassins ...
today...

37:08.878 --> 37:10.697
you are to arrest members of the
Clique listed here!

37:10.697 --> 37:12.679
He commands several dozen followers,

37:12.727 --> 37:14.679
all highly skilled fighters.

37:15.439 --> 37:17.359
Lui Jianxing!
- Yes, Sir.

37:17.359 --> 37:19.166
Shen Lian!
- Yes, Sir.

37:19.266 --> 37:20.818
You two come with me.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.259
We're going to Yan Peiwei's residence.

37:24.927 --> 37:26.650
When you kill,

37:28.347 --> 37:30.501
it's essential not to leave any traces.

37:34.726 --> 37:36.438
Commander, we have been waiting 
a long time.

37:36.438 --> 37:37.814
Shall we force our way in?

37:38.251 --> 37:40.154
We're coming for Yan Peiwei alone.

37:40.468 --> 37:42.886
Why storm the residence?
Is it a massacre you want?

37:45.319 --> 37:47.168
Any volunteers to go get him?

37:47.841 --> 37:49.140
Jianxing ...

37:49.497 --> 37:50.928
something is not right!

37:51.480 --> 37:52.856
Don't go!

37:53.330 --> 37:54.821
What are you scared of?

37:55.535 --> 37:58.601
Are the Golden Swords that scary?

37:59.326 --> 38:00.644
Who would have the guts...

38:00.644 --> 38:02.145
to resist Imperial Assassins?

38:02.253 --> 38:03.790
I have orders.

38:04.103 --> 38:05.867
Whoever captures Yan Peiwei...

38:06.563 --> 38:08.216
will be promoted.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.790
Lui Jianxing ...

38:17.491 --> 38:18.724
wouldn't you...

38:18.724 --> 38:20.309
like this credit?

38:27.217 --> 38:28.766
You two don't have to go.

38:28.912 --> 38:30.504
I'll go by myself.

38:45.582 --> 38:47.409
Sir, how can I help you?

38:47.961 --> 38:49.802
I am Garrison Officer Lui Jianxing.

38:49.904 --> 38:51.501
I'm here to see Sir Yan.

38:51.528 --> 38:53.480
I am Yan Junbin, son of Yan Peiwei.

38:54.024 --> 38:55.703
My father is not well,

38:55.788 --> 38:57.419
and does not want to receive visitors.

38:57.419 --> 39:01.602
I have Division orders,
to bring Sir Yan in for questioning.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.826
This is the mandate.

39:04.087 --> 39:06.545
Young Master Yan,
it's better to let me in ...

39:06.893 --> 39:09.766
instead of having the Baihu Commander
killing his way in!

39:10.126 --> 39:11.680
What do you say?

39:14.934 --> 39:17.917
Alright ...
please follow me.

39:37.597 --> 39:38.992
Having Imperial Assassins here...

39:38.992 --> 39:40.270
makes them nervous!

39:40.270 --> 39:41.836
Please don't be offended.

39:46.007 --> 39:47.711
Father ...

39:54.997 --> 39:56.657
Junbin, what are you doing?

39:56.657 --> 39:58.371
Father, I read the mandate.

39:58.371 --> 39:59.830
They're framing you to be 
a member of the Clique.

39:59.830 --> 40:00.938
So what?

40:00.938 --> 40:02.583
Even if I have to go to the highest court,

40:02.583 --> 40:03.810
I'm still innocent.

40:03.810 --> 40:05.118
What do I have to be scared of?

40:05.138 --> 40:07.490
Once you're in the Imperial Prison,
they will torture a confession out of you.

40:07.490 --> 40:09.325
Why don't we tie up these Assassins...

40:09.325 --> 40:11.266
and make a run for it?
- Shut up!

40:12.039 --> 40:14.122
What you suggest is rebellion!
- Father!

40:14.655 --> 40:17.706
Sir Yan, we know you're not 
a member of the Clique.

40:17.996 --> 40:19.703
It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

40:19.703 --> 40:21.897
I'm sure the judges will clear your name.

40:22.321 --> 40:23.899
I do hope that...

40:24.240 --> 40:25.851
you can come with us.

40:26.227 --> 40:29.010
I'll come with you, but can you...

40:29.010 --> 40:31.070
leave my family alone?
- Father!

40:32.103 --> 40:33.680
By all means.

40:35.639 --> 40:37.056
I won't be long.

40:39.336 --> 40:40.678
Father!

40:42.859 --> 40:44.198
Father!

40:48.278 --> 40:49.617
Kill them!

40:55.265 --> 40:56.758
Send the signal!

41:00.520 --> 41:03.470
Commander, the fight seems to 
have started. Are we going in?

41:08.628 --> 41:10.487
Are you telling me what to do?

41:11.056 --> 41:12.149
I would never.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.632
No one goes in!
Seal off the gate.

41:15.632 --> 41:17.620
Don't let any Clique member get out!

41:18.618 --> 41:20.261
Wait till it dies down inside.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.813
Open the gate!

41:34.852 --> 41:36.455
Friends!
Open the gate!

41:46.200 --> 41:47.917
Jianxing, the gate is sealed!

41:54.770 --> 41:56.121
Everybody, stop!

42:17.880 --> 42:19.243
Lian!

42:21.477 --> 42:22.786
Jianxing!

42:28.479 --> 42:29.745
Yichuan ...
- I'm here!

42:29.831 --> 42:31.977
Lian ... - I'm here to!
- Let's finish this!

42:32.145 --> 42:33.864
And go get drunk.

42:36.490 --> 42:37.816
Arrows!

42:57.279 --> 42:58.579
Arrows!

43:03.768 --> 43:05.206
Your tea, Your Excellency.

43:08.508 --> 43:10.649
One Two ... One Two ...

44:21.668 --> 44:23.067
Yichuan ...

44:33.958 --> 44:35.372
What exactly ...

44:37.445 --> 44:38.989
did we do?

44:56.413 --> 44:57.904
Why are there no sounds?

44:58.059 --> 44:59.372
Open the gate!

45:34.674 --> 45:37.450
Your Excellency ...
the three of them are coming out!

46:08.682 --> 46:10.440
Shit ... Goddamned!

46:19.969 --> 46:21.303
Who is it?

46:23.231 --> 46:24.670
Who's there?

46:40.632 --> 46:42.023
Officer Shen,

46:42.148 --> 46:43.839
are you trying to scare me to death?

46:44.462 --> 46:45.902
I wouldn't dare!

46:47.183 --> 46:49.566
Especially ...
after I almost died myself.

46:52.177 --> 46:53.525
It wasn't me!

46:54.204 --> 46:56.053
I didn't order for the gate to be sealed!

46:56.566 --> 46:58.486
I don't know which bastard gave the order!

46:59.151 --> 47:01.013
I told them ...
to open the gate.

47:02.209 --> 47:04.291
Please, it wasn't me!
- I understand.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.391
The three of us...

47:06.391 --> 47:07.910
took care of Wei Zhongxian.

47:08.271 --> 47:10.558
Obviously, the Clique wants us dead.

47:12.243 --> 47:14.479
We can't stay in Beijing anymore.

47:15.420 --> 47:17.005
Please ...

47:17.581 --> 47:20.187
transfer us to Nanjing.

47:28.166 --> 47:29.703
300 taels ...

47:30.820 --> 47:32.275
Sure thing.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.137
Once in Nanjing,

47:34.279 --> 47:36.638
Jianxing would be promoted, 
I presume.

47:36.828 --> 47:38.303
Sure.

47:40.628 --> 47:41.957
Shen Lian,

47:42.700 --> 47:44.490
let's put this thing...

47:45.320 --> 47:46.829
behind us.

47:49.134 --> 47:50.418
Shall we?

48:04.421 --> 48:07.241
Sir Shen ...
my master asked me to deliver this.

48:32.348 --> 48:33.836
Father, have some tea.

48:35.269 --> 48:37.006
Sir Jin, have some tea.

49:09.907 --> 49:11.775
It's time.
I want the money.

49:13.571 --> 49:16.231
A petty criminal killing an 
Imperial Assassin...

49:16.231 --> 49:18.095
and stealing his identity ...

49:18.195 --> 49:19.747
I'm sure...

49:19.847 --> 49:22.821
the police would be interested
in that story.

49:29.726 --> 49:31.122
100 taels ...

49:34.196 --> 49:35.934
And leave Ynchuan alone!

49:36.568 --> 49:38.282
Take the money and get lost.

49:38.758 --> 49:40.658
Didn't expect 
Sir Shen to be so well off.

49:42.006 --> 49:44.900
Ding Xiu,
I did my homework on you.

49:45.140 --> 49:46.765
You're an excellent swordsman,

49:46.800 --> 49:48.818
but you're no match 
for an Imperial Assassin.

50:01.489 --> 50:02.812
Thanks.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.518
So you knew all along?
- Yichuan ...

50:11.753 --> 50:13.428
we're like brothers.

50:13.628 --> 50:15.245
I won't ask you about Ding Xiu.

50:15.311 --> 50:16.682
In return...

50:16.780 --> 50:18.221
please don't ask me...

50:18.289 --> 50:19.709
about the money.

50:20.197 --> 50:22.190
Deal?
- Sure.

50:24.899 --> 50:27.251
Jianxing ...
Sir Han is throwing a dinner party.

50:27.251 --> 50:28.777
We're all invited.

50:33.177 --> 50:35.613
<i>Lian, 
you're hiding something from me.</i>

50:36.160 --> 50:37.798
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

50:38.430 --> 50:40.059
<i>Ever since we came back here...</i>

50:40.094 --> 50:41.926
<i>I know something is not right.</i>

50:42.351 --> 50:45.474
<i>I've been wondering,
that night at the inn ...</i>

50:46.190 --> 50:47.840
<i>what really happened?</i>

50:48.542 --> 50:51.423
<i>Jianxing ...
I never betrayed you...</i>

50:51.423 --> 50:52.946
<i>or Yichuan in any way.</i>

50:53.937 --> 50:55.388
<i>My conscience is clear.</i>

50:55.611 --> 50:56.951
<i>I trust you.</i>

51:04.800 --> 51:07.084
Sir Han is here!

51:09.019 --> 51:12.020
Sir Han ... Sir Zhao.

51:12.827 --> 51:15.381
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

51:18.592 --> 51:21.799
Officer Liu.
- Your Excellency.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.409
Why are you hiding in the corner?
Come.

51:24.483 --> 51:25.818
Sit here.

51:26.343 --> 51:28.506
Your Excellency,
I'm just a lowly officer.

51:29.027 --> 51:31.983
I don't deserve to share 
a table with you and Sir Zhao.

51:32.481 --> 51:33.749
Nonsense.

51:34.139 --> 51:36.151
It's your big day today.

51:36.620 --> 51:38.004
You should sit here.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.497
What big day?
I don't understand.

51:41.190 --> 51:43.386
Officer Liu 
carried out His Majesty's orders...

51:43.450 --> 51:45.191
and killed Wei Zhongxian.

51:45.430 --> 51:46.981
That's his first feat.

51:47.205 --> 51:50.248
Today he came out unscathed from
the Yan residence,

51:50.519 --> 51:52.855
and captured Yan Peiwei's son alive.

51:53.070 --> 51:54.698
That's his second feat.

51:55.712 --> 51:57.876
Sir Zhenfu Commander,
what were you saying just now?

51:58.467 --> 51:59.731
Your Excellency,

51:59.731 --> 52:01.315
Officer Lui should be promoted...

52:01.319 --> 52:03.084
to Baihu Commander.

52:05.046 --> 52:06.432
Bring it over.

52:08.973 --> 52:10.845
Congratulations, Sir Lui.

52:11.558 --> 52:14.539
Tomorrow you'll be a level 6 officer
of the Imperial Court.

52:15.038 --> 52:16.976
You are of course qualified 
for this table.

52:18.921 --> 52:21.369
As you say, Your Excellency.

52:22.519 --> 52:24.423
There was a funny story actually.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.706
Sir Lui was so impatient that...

52:26.804 --> 52:29.409
he gave Zhang Ying 300 taels...

52:29.409 --> 52:30.993
to bribe the right people.

52:30.993 --> 52:32.733
It was completely unnecessary.

52:43.354 --> 52:44.782
Sir Lui ...

52:59.073 --> 53:00.571
Please don't be offended.

53:01.801 --> 53:03.446
There are only good friends here tonight.

53:03.565 --> 53:05.539
Don't be embarrassed.
- Yes.

53:05.910 --> 53:07.538
And don't go to Nanjing.

53:07.890 --> 53:09.729
The Imperial Court needs people like you.

53:09.890 --> 53:12.221
The three of you,
are better off here.

53:13.198 --> 53:14.551
Nanjing?

53:14.664 --> 53:16.650
Zhang Ying said you asked to be
transferred to Nanjing.

53:21.909 --> 53:23.995
The food I serve is plain,

53:24.415 --> 53:26.813
so I'm showing a performance...

53:27.049 --> 53:28.799
to add a little flavor.

53:51.778 --> 53:53.210
By the way, Sir Lui...

53:53.210 --> 53:54.973
where did you get the 300 taels...

53:55.039 --> 53:56.465
for bribery?

54:05.367 --> 54:06.756
Sir Lui,

54:06.871 --> 54:08.543
you killed Wei Zhongxian,

54:09.023 --> 54:10.910
and brought back tons of
his treasures.

54:12.242 --> 54:14.346
Sometimes Imperial Assassins...

54:14.446 --> 54:15.938
keep a little pocket money.

54:16.038 --> 54:18.066
I completely understand.

54:19.359 --> 54:21.147
What I'm saying is...

54:21.560 --> 54:23.462
you didn't need to spend that money.

54:23.823 --> 54:25.436
The position...

54:25.750 --> 54:27.474
would be yours anyway.

54:33.052 --> 54:34.955
In three days we'll perform an autopsy.

54:36.049 --> 54:37.998
If we prove the body is really Wei's,

54:38.798 --> 54:40.717
His Majesty will announce to the world...

54:40.817 --> 54:43.878
that ...
the Clique has fallen.

54:45.998 --> 54:49.218
And now ...
let's drink up.

55:04.968 --> 55:06.551
Sir ...

55:09.589 --> 55:11.528
with the condition it's in ...

55:11.749 --> 55:13.814
it's still possible to examine the body?

55:17.015 --> 55:18.909
Wei drank elixir for so many years...

55:19.079 --> 55:21.008
that we can still find it in his bones.

55:21.008 --> 55:23.878
This inspection is merely a formality.

55:27.129 --> 55:28.745
No need to worry.

55:29.819 --> 55:31.224
You're right.

55:34.738 --> 55:36.329
Sir Lui,

55:37.032 --> 55:38.773
you're getting promoted tomorrow,

55:38.773 --> 55:40.307
and yet you don't seem excited.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.562
Anything on your mind?

55:45.207 --> 55:46.587
No ... No.

55:46.967 --> 55:48.613
I'm rather flattered.

55:50.083 --> 55:51.313
Good.

56:13.892 --> 56:15.489
What are you exactly,

56:15.564 --> 56:17.118
a good guy or a bad guy?

56:17.118 --> 56:18.711
I did it to stay alive.

56:19.460 --> 56:21.264
What would you have done?

56:25.638 --> 56:27.122
I know...

56:27.122 --> 56:29.219
you guys made a fortune.

56:29.635 --> 56:31.107
Give me half the money.

56:31.276 --> 56:34.130
Otherwise ...
I'll perform your story...

56:34.316 --> 56:37.509
every day in front of the Division office.

56:42.656 --> 56:44.079
Xiu ...

56:44.226 --> 56:45.582
what fortune?

56:46.121 --> 56:47.749
There's no such thing.

56:53.658 --> 56:55.052
Sir Zhao.

56:56.182 --> 56:57.610
You know who I am?

56:57.610 --> 57:00.210
Who doesn't in this town?

57:23.649 --> 57:24.992
Not bad.

57:26.536 --> 57:27.766
Your Excellency ...

57:27.766 --> 57:29.678
this flute is a family heirloom.

57:38.315 --> 57:39.911
May I be excused?

57:52.548 --> 57:54.147
Jianxing.

57:58.878 --> 58:01.838
There's something that I've been ...
- Jianxing!

58:03.068 --> 58:04.586
Tell me ...
- Jianxing, stop it!

58:04.586 --> 58:06.319
Why did you have to buy me a promotion?

58:06.319 --> 58:08.158
Where did you get the silver?

58:09.285 --> 58:11.592
Tell me ...
- You are my sworn brother,

58:11.858 --> 58:13.577
and you set me up like this?

58:13.577 --> 58:14.959
Tell me! Tell me!

58:15.464 --> 58:16.729
Jianxing, stop it!

58:16.729 --> 58:19.109
Lian, tell him the truth!
- Go away!

58:27.320 --> 58:30.799
Yichuan ... are you alright?

58:31.543 --> 58:33.222
Yichuan.
- I'm fine.

58:46.351 --> 58:48.642
Wei Zhongxian is not dead!

58:51.383 --> 58:52.718
What?

58:58.892 --> 59:00.538
Every penny he gave me is here.

59:02.967 --> 59:04.382
That's for Jianxing.

59:05.907 --> 59:07.326
That's for Yichuan.

59:08.561 --> 59:09.824
And that's for Miaotong.

59:10.440 --> 59:11.866
I didn't think...

59:11.951 --> 59:13.658
it would turn out this way.

59:13.948 --> 59:15.385
In that case,

59:15.408 --> 59:16.915
we were in so many trouble...

59:16.963 --> 59:19.010
because Wei Zhongxian wants to kill us.

59:20.003 --> 59:21.458
I'd like to borrow...

59:21.539 --> 59:23.263
some of your guards,
if I may be so bold.

59:23.263 --> 59:25.391
Zhao Jingzhong,
you already screwed it up.

59:25.738 --> 59:27.538
How dare you ask for Godfather's guards!

59:31.078 --> 59:32.641
Jianxing, Lian...

59:33.567 --> 59:35.909
Sir Zhao is very likely the man in
black last night.

59:37.630 --> 59:39.565
Han Kuang is performing an autopsy
in three days.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.854
Those three have to be gone by the
day after tomorrow.

59:45.988 --> 59:48.218
Yichuan ...
don't say that unless you're sure.

59:48.218 --> 59:49.718
I saw the arrow wound on his hand.

59:50.094 --> 59:51.641
Lian's crossbow arrow...

59:51.641 --> 59:53.450
is different from anyone else's.

59:53.748 --> 59:56.221
I saw the shape 
of Sir Zhao's wound clearly.

59:59.843 --> 01:00:01.227
Godfather,

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:04.249
within 24 hours,
I will have their heads for you.

01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:07.865
Jingzhong,

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:10.526
you didn't expose yourself to them,

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.758
did you?

01:00:16.644 --> 01:00:18.501
Leave the country with me.

01:00:19.666 --> 01:00:20.920
There is...

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.643
no place for you in the Capital anymore.

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:31.979
Reluctant, aren't you?

01:00:34.012 --> 01:00:35.502
Yichuan,

01:00:35.504 --> 01:00:37.612
tie me up and take me to
the authority.

01:00:39.695 --> 01:00:41.230
It was my fault.

01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:44.556
I can't get you two involved.

01:00:46.328 --> 01:00:47.800
The doctor's daughter is very nice.

01:00:48.047 --> 01:00:49.539
Treat her with care.

01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:52.267
Those who rely on their luck...

01:00:52.787 --> 01:00:54.531
are gamblers,

01:00:55.223 --> 01:00:56.707
and you...

01:00:58.039 --> 01:01:00.205
won't make a very good one.

01:01:02.922 --> 01:01:04.497
Godfather ...

01:01:09.027 --> 01:01:10.942
I am ready to try my luck.

01:01:23.398 --> 01:01:24.802
Jianxing,

01:01:27.626 --> 01:01:29.610
I only ask you to do one last
thing for me.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.343
Buy Miaotong's freedom.

01:01:34.359 --> 01:01:35.739
Let's go!

01:01:35.978 --> 01:01:37.601
Let's leave town together.

01:01:42.479 --> 01:01:44.069
Nobody needs to die.

01:01:44.278 --> 01:01:46.602
We'll live peacefully ...
somewhere else.

01:01:50.011 --> 01:01:52.020
Yichuan, go pack your things.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.575
We'll leave separately tomorrow.

01:02:00.197 --> 01:02:02.301
We have to be out of town
by nightfall.

01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:20.462
Your Excellency.

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.092
You're a skilled fighter.

01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:24.228
I want you to kill someone for me.
- 200 taels.

01:02:30.505 --> 01:02:32.140
Here's 100, as an advance.

01:02:32.777 --> 01:02:34.344
Who does Your Excellency want to kill?

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:36.134
An officer of the Zhanfu Division.

01:02:36.638 --> 01:02:38.390
Jin Yichuan.
- Who?

01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:41.062
Don't you know we studied with
the same master?

01:02:41.062 --> 01:02:42.612
People like you...

01:02:43.255 --> 01:02:44.709
wouldn't care about that.

01:02:45.976 --> 01:02:47.304
That's not what I meant.

01:02:47.304 --> 01:02:51.641
That person is very dear to me,
like a brother.

01:02:54.158 --> 01:02:55.597
You need to pay more!

01:03:17.116 --> 01:03:20.706
I Monkey King,
will teach you a lesson.

01:03:43.346 --> 01:03:44.615
Miaotong!

01:03:48.359 --> 01:03:50.396
The contents need 
to be changed regularly,

01:03:50.396 --> 01:03:51.985
or it won't work.

01:03:53.048 --> 01:03:54.594
Come here every three days,

01:03:54.678 --> 01:03:56.260
and I'll change it for you.

01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:00.450
I'm leaving town today.

01:04:26.557 --> 01:04:28.368
Are you here to see the doctor?

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:31.279
My father's out visiting a patient.
- That's okay.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.787
I can wait.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:36.038
It's for you.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.664
The pardon letter from the 
Ministry of Penalty!

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.496
Where did you get this?

01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:42.922
I'm here today to set you free.

01:04:43.678 --> 01:04:45.128
I'm leaving town.

01:04:45.639 --> 01:04:47.052
Come with me.

01:04:48.462 --> 01:04:50.655
That's your condition for giving
me my freedom?

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.070
I came here...

01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:02.961
to ask you a favor.

01:05:03.415 --> 01:05:05.170
There's an official in the name of Yan.

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.841
His son, Yan Junbin...

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.127
I heard is now in prison.
Can you get him out?

01:05:10.934 --> 01:05:12.587
Yan Junbin was captured by us.

01:05:13.216 --> 01:05:15.381
The three of us almost died
at their house.

01:05:15.926 --> 01:05:17.524
One of his hands ...

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.702
What happened to him?

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.471
Nothing!

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:35.457
I can give you money to make arrangements.

01:05:37.072 --> 01:05:38.653
Please get him out.

01:05:40.733 --> 01:05:42.465
You shouldn't squander your
money this way.

01:05:42.465 --> 01:05:44.629
It's my money,
I can decide what to do with it.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:49.307
I never asked you for anything.

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:51.718
Just this once.

01:05:59.868 --> 01:06:01.439
It's the Imperial Prison.

01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:06.843
If you get him out ...

01:06:08.299 --> 01:06:09.867
I'll come with you.

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:14.920
When he reads this letter...

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.798
he'll trust you.

01:06:19.203 --> 01:06:21.231
Lian ... Lian ...

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:27.276
Is Miss Zhou coming with us?
- What time is it?

01:06:27.276 --> 01:06:28.798
Three.

01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:30.756
Stay with Miss Zhou.

01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:33.144
Where are you going?

01:06:33.144 --> 01:06:34.943
The gates won't be closed for
another four hours.

01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:36.771
I'll be back by then.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.512
Listen ...

01:06:47.854 --> 01:06:49.599
I have many more bottles of drugs.

01:06:49.785 --> 01:06:52.417
Confess ...
and you won't need to suffer anymore.

01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:56.199
Stop wasting your time with him.
Finish the last few bottles...

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:57.948
and we can go home.

01:07:01.012 --> 01:07:03.073
Officer ...
we have Commanders orders...

01:07:03.073 --> 01:07:04.878
to keep feeding him this drug.

01:07:05.536 --> 01:07:07.221
Take a walk.
- But ...

01:07:07.221 --> 01:07:08.720
You didn't see me.

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:13.838
Go, go, go.

01:07:17.448 --> 01:07:19.462
Sir Yan, I am Shen Lian ...

01:07:19.607 --> 01:07:21.203
a friend of Miaotong's.

01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:23.689
She asked me to get you out of here.

01:07:24.192 --> 01:07:25.644
Miaotong ...

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.928
She wrote you a letter,

01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:40.455
and asked me to bring it to you.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.864
My eyes are gone.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.144
Sir Shen, please ...

01:07:45.678 --> 01:07:47.339
read the letter to me.

01:07:47.987 --> 01:07:49.427
Will you?

01:07:58.061 --> 01:07:59.359
To Junbin ...

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.967
The wrongs that have been done to you...

01:08:01.067 --> 01:08:02.789
will be righted someday.

01:08:02.924 --> 01:08:04.547
Please don't give up.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.759
You once said that you'd take me
to a beautiful place.

01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:10.779
I'll be waiting for you.

01:08:15.702 --> 01:08:17.582
Let's get out of here.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.546
Lian is back.

01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:30.631
Are you looking for Sir Shen?
He's not here.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.746
I'm not looking for Sir Shen.

01:08:32.746 --> 01:08:35.640
A Sir asked me to deliver 
something to a Sir Jin.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.210
Prepare my sedan.
We're going to the Imperial Hospital.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:43.577
Yes, Sir.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:46.497
Your Excellency, Sir Han has left 
for the Imperial Hospital.

01:08:46.596 --> 01:08:47.968
Yichuan ...

01:08:52.486 --> 01:08:53.872
There's still time.

01:08:54.386 --> 01:08:55.803
We can still make it!

01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:22.596
Gentlemen...

01:09:22.596 --> 01:09:24.903
I need to make a trip to the
Division office tonight.

01:09:25.198 --> 01:09:27.285
Would you care to join me?

01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:31.203
Sir Baihu, why do you need 
to go there tonight?

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:34.218
To take my punishment.

01:09:34.318 --> 01:09:37.205
Tell Ting to do it.
- Yes, Sir.

01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:41.542
Sir Shen.
- Where's Miaotong?

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.426
I'm here to buy her freedom.

01:09:48.904 --> 01:09:50.348
Doctor Zhang.

01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:53.675
Doctor Zhang ...

01:10:30.129 --> 01:10:31.580
Let her go.

01:10:37.732 --> 01:10:40.484
I'm aware that people say you
should never...

01:10:40.565 --> 01:10:42.099
kill doctors,

01:10:42.099 --> 01:10:43.692
but I had no choice.

01:10:43.692 --> 01:10:45.803
Someone paid a price for your head.

01:10:46.537 --> 01:10:48.197
A very high price.

01:10:49.398 --> 01:10:51.094
I plan to kill you anyway,

01:10:51.469 --> 01:10:53.368
so why not make some money?

01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:54.909
So let's not waste...

01:10:55.087 --> 01:10:56.657
any more time.

01:11:07.988 --> 01:11:09.603
You picked a good one.

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.522
This girl ...

01:11:13.267 --> 01:11:14.978
feels really good.

01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:34.314
Why aren't you packed?

01:11:37.825 --> 01:11:39.320
How is ...

01:11:39.355 --> 01:11:40.793
Sir Yan?

01:11:41.528 --> 01:11:43.508
No big deal.
You don't need to pack.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.386
I'll buy you new things.

01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:48.099
How is Sir Yan?

01:11:52.169 --> 01:11:53.566
Miaotong ...

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.867
I have bought you freedom.

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:57.953
We have to hurry.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.926
The gates will be closed soon.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.438
Where is Sir Yan?
What happened to him?

01:12:14.724 --> 01:12:16.562
I'm as good as dead.

01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:19.973
I can't imagine what else they 
would do to me.

01:12:23.348 --> 01:12:24.963
You don't need to wait for him.

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.322
He's dead.

01:12:31.398 --> 01:12:32.705
I don't believe you!

01:12:32.705 --> 01:12:34.988
You're only saying that so I'd
come with you.

01:12:36.761 --> 01:12:38.239
I'm waiting for him.

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.763
I'm not lying.

01:12:45.706 --> 01:12:47.468
I have a huge favor to ask.

01:12:48.519 --> 01:12:51.206
Please kill me.
- I killed him.

01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:54.331
He begged me to.

01:12:58.743 --> 01:13:00.280
If you're dead ...

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.315
what am I supposed to say to her?

01:13:03.309 --> 01:13:04.869
You chopped off my hand.

01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:09.125
Kill me ...
and we're even.

01:13:09.823 --> 01:13:11.446
You knew it was me?

01:13:21.706 --> 01:13:23.479
Tell Miaotong that ...

01:13:24.688 --> 01:13:26.484
she doesn't need to wait for me.

01:13:29.668 --> 01:13:31.185
We have to hurry.

01:13:44.458 --> 01:13:46.667
We have a change only if we go now.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.492
Miaotong ...

01:14:06.527 --> 01:14:08.349
we must leave.

01:14:11.498 --> 01:14:13.107
I was 12 years old ...

01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:17.781
when Imperial Assassins ransacked
our house.

01:14:20.991 --> 01:14:22.776
It was also them ...

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.704
who brought me to this place.

01:14:34.267 --> 01:14:36.455
Ever since the first time I saw you.

01:14:37.197 --> 01:14:38.832
I've been scared of you.

01:14:39.758 --> 01:14:41.468
I hated your uniform ...

01:14:42.414 --> 01:14:44.294
and that blade.

01:14:45.985 --> 01:14:47.718
You think I like you?

01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:49.800
I'm just scared of you.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.894
I know ...

01:15:00.507 --> 01:15:02.393
you've been good to me,

01:15:03.948 --> 01:15:05.898
better than anyone.

01:15:07.276 --> 01:15:09.078
But I just can't let it go.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.886
I saw your face so clearly.

01:15:17.735 --> 01:15:19.722
On the day my family was ransacked.

01:15:21.339 --> 01:15:22.849
I saw you.

01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:26.284
You arrested my father with
your own hands.

01:15:30.279 --> 01:15:33.397
I don't know if I should hate you
or be grateful.

01:15:46.078 --> 01:15:48.099
Do you still want me to come with you?

01:15:50.388 --> 01:15:52.088
Sir Shen?

01:17:51.788 --> 01:17:53.417
Sir Han ...

01:17:54.287 --> 01:17:56.598
the bones are not right.
He's too young.

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.763
He can't be Wei Zhongxian.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.649
Only when you're dead,
can Godfather live in peace.

01:18:17.297 --> 01:18:19.444
Run for your life,
when you still can.

01:18:28.723 --> 01:18:31.287
Lui Jianxing ...
you have deceived His Majesty!

01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:32.823
Throw down your weapon.

01:18:35.067 --> 01:18:36.693
Kill them.

01:19:17.627 --> 01:19:19.230
Miaotong.

01:19:19.815 --> 01:19:21.637
I'll take you to the doctor.

01:19:24.538 --> 01:19:25.904
Leave me alone.

01:19:26.281 --> 01:19:28.362
Jin Yichuan 
is at the Bailu Clinic.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.176
Go find him.

01:19:45.137 --> 01:19:46.918
Why didn't you kill Wei Zhongxian?

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:49.446
I wanted to live.
- It seems you want to die instead.

01:19:50.078 --> 01:19:51.615
Your Excellency,

01:19:51.798 --> 01:19:53.518
you have exposed yourself.

01:19:53.518 --> 01:19:54.863
So what?

01:19:56.108 --> 01:19:57.884
If I kill you three...

01:19:58.402 --> 01:20:01.111
I'll still be Commander
of the Secret Police tomorrow.

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:41.174
You are so dead!
Not just you,

01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:42.786
but this woman aswell.

01:22:23.543 --> 01:22:26.253
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency ...

01:22:27.448 --> 01:22:28.769
Your Excellency.

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:52.841
If it weren't for me ...

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:57.250
you wouldn't end up like this.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.395
You will yourself cut like this.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.852
Even if I have one breath left.

01:24:04.046 --> 01:24:05.745
I'm gonna kill you!

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.338
Those moves of yours...

01:24:21.469 --> 01:24:23.378
Master never taught me.

01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:03.766
You're such a wreck.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:05.690
Going on would be boring.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:08.584
Consider our score settled today.

01:25:12.991 --> 01:25:14.535
Don't hurt the girl.

01:25:16.519 --> 01:25:18.321
Don't hurt the girl.

01:25:23.992 --> 01:25:25.609
What if I tell you...

01:25:26.606 --> 01:25:28.973
that all I ever did 
was kill her father,

01:25:29.248 --> 01:25:31.303
and I never laid a finger on her!

01:25:32.248 --> 01:25:33.814
Would you be happy?

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:47.520
This is the end.

01:25:57.998 --> 01:25:59.734
But if I really kill you,

01:26:02.487 --> 01:26:04.171
I'll be alone ...

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.544
in this world.

01:26:18.337 --> 01:26:19.885
Go away ...

01:26:33.047 --> 01:26:34.518
Lui Jianxing?

01:26:34.518 --> 01:26:36.209
I am Lui Jianxing.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.483
Your Honor.

01:26:38.483 --> 01:26:41.196
Lui Jianxing ...
did you let go of Wei Zhongxian?

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.949
Yes.
- Why?

01:26:49.693 --> 01:26:51.290
So where is Wei...

01:26:51.507 --> 01:26:53.161
at the moment?

01:26:54.311 --> 01:26:55.732
I don't know.

01:26:57.055 --> 01:26:58.679
Who ordered you to do that?

01:26:59.118 --> 01:27:00.734
I took orders from no one...

01:27:01.459 --> 01:27:03.030
and worked with no one!

01:27:03.411 --> 01:27:05.158
It was all me.

01:27:20.719 --> 01:27:22.115
Your Majesty ...

01:27:22.115 --> 01:27:24.618
would you like me to interrogate
Lui Jianxing?

01:27:24.618 --> 01:27:26.867
I'll make sure he spill out the
other members.

01:27:28.769 --> 01:27:30.644
I've already killed hundreds.

01:27:31.062 --> 01:27:34.264
Even Yuan Chonghuan built a
temple for Wei.

01:27:35.381 --> 01:27:36.904
Do you want to kill him too?

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.342
You want there to be no man
at my command?

01:27:40.837 --> 01:27:42.278
I would never dare.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.270
Don't let Lui Jianxing name
any more names.

01:27:46.408 --> 01:27:48.376
Kill him!
- I understand.

01:27:49.793 --> 01:27:51.643
Why is Zhao Jingzhong not here?

01:27:51.945 --> 01:27:53.477
Zhao Jingzhong ...

01:27:54.765 --> 01:27:56.217
He disappeared.

01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:37.557
<i>Clique Member Lui Jianxing...</i>

01:28:38.308 --> 01:28:39.937
<i>to be executed!</i>

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.459
I'm sorry.

01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.153
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:28:52.851 --> 01:28:54.507
<i>The indentity of the criminal...</i>

01:28:54.514 --> 01:28:56.208
<i>has been verified.</i>

01:28:56.447 --> 01:28:57.718
<i>Execute!</i>

01:29:11.565 --> 01:29:13.366
I'm so sorry for everything!

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.389
Sir Jin.

01:29:52.499 --> 01:29:56.470
<i>[ North Frontier, War Zone, 2 months later. ]</i>

01:30:20.488 --> 01:30:22.751
He's still following us.
It's been two weeks now.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.258
We just can't lose him.

01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:25.804
It's Shen Lian.

01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:27.098
Shen Lian!

01:31:27.177 --> 01:31:28.723
I gave you a change to live,

01:31:29.710 --> 01:31:31.559
and you came back to haunt me.

01:31:32.216 --> 01:31:33.673
If I don't kill you,

01:31:33.717 --> 01:31:35.447
I'm as good as dead.

01:31:38.717 --> 01:31:40.662
You want 
to avenge your sworn brothers?

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.285
Let me tell you something.

01:31:44.526 --> 01:31:46.260
His Majesty only requested that...

01:31:46.341 --> 01:31:48.273
Wei be taken back to the Capital,

01:31:48.364 --> 01:31:50.198
but didn't want him dead.

01:31:50.684 --> 01:31:52.317
It was me who wanted him dead.

01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:53.862
You faked His Majesty's order.

01:31:54.558 --> 01:31:56.261
Even if we killed Wei Zhongxian,

01:31:56.369 --> 01:31:57.995
you would still kill us.

01:32:00.456 --> 01:32:02.518
From the moment
I approached you three ...

01:32:03.743 --> 01:32:05.517
you were dead already.

01:32:30.056 --> 01:32:32.679
Which of you is
General Li Yongfang's friend?

01:32:36.741 --> 01:32:38.520
I am Zhao Jingzhong.

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.139
You're joining the Manchurians!

01:32:43.763 --> 01:32:45.607
Those two Han men are enemies.

01:32:52.322 --> 01:32:56.580
Kill him! Go ...

01:32:58.724 --> 01:33:00.349
As I said before,

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:02.151
you're suicidal!

01:33:02.434 --> 01:33:05.691
<i>The reason why our country
is wrecked with problems...</i>

01:33:06.031 --> 01:33:08.456
<i>and people can barely make
ends meet ...</i>

01:33:09.449 --> 01:33:11.637
<i>is because of people like you!</i>

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.857
<i>As long as I'm standing...</i>

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.308
you have no change of leaving alive.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.972
Ding Xiu, is no match for them.

01:33:23.104 --> 01:33:24.843
And you ...

01:33:25.502 --> 01:33:27.464
you really think you can kill me?

01:33:45.498 --> 01:33:47.170
Arrows!

01:35:28.982 --> 01:35:30.869
Your sidekick won't last
much longer.

01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:33.263
Neither will you!

01:36:15.482 --> 01:36:17.823
Why did you approach us three
in the first place?

01:36:18.269 --> 01:36:20.448
You worthless people ...

01:36:22.018 --> 01:36:24.362
who would care if you died?

01:36:25.429 --> 01:36:27.158
When I want you crushed,

01:36:27.158 --> 01:36:28.627
you are crushed!

01:36:29.535 --> 01:36:31.116
Zhao Jingzhong ...

01:36:31.366 --> 01:36:33.525
you're no longer 
Commander of the Secret Police.

01:36:33.773 --> 01:36:35.531
You lost everything ...

01:36:35.908 --> 01:36:37.918
thanks to us worthless people.

01:38:49.844 --> 01:38:51.359
<i>Go down south,</i>

01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:53.179
<i>to Suzhou.</i>

01:38:54.065 --> 01:38:55.607
<i>When you get there...</i>

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.737
<i>go to Qijia Lane...</i>

01:38:58.324 --> 01:39:00.119
<i>and find the second courtyard
on the left.</i>

01:39:00.599 --> 01:39:01.936
<i>Your Zhou Miaotong...</i>

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:03.670
<i>and the Zhang girl ...</i>

01:39:04.098 --> 01:39:05.628
<i>are both there.</i>

01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:09.667
Thank you.
- No need.

01:39:11.334 --> 01:39:13.258
If you didn't kill Zhao Jingzhong ...

01:39:14.145 --> 01:39:16.138
I would have killed you both.

01:39:59.468 --> 01:40:02.586
<i>Jianxing ...
when we leave Beijing,</i>

01:40:03.043 --> 01:40:05.199
<i>where would you want to go?
- Me?</i>

01:40:05.656 --> 01:40:09.102
<i>To Quanzhou.
I want to show my mother the ocean,</i>

01:40:09.524 --> 01:40:11.006
<i>and the big ships.</i>

01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:13.334
<i>Lian, what about you?</i>

01:40:14.832 --> 01:40:16.492
<i>Suzhou, I guess.</i>

01:40:17.257 --> 01:40:18.659
<i>Enough about us.</i>

01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:20.522
<i>Where do you want to go, Yichuan?</i>

01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:22.730
<i>I want to go
beyond the northern borders.</i>

01:40:22.744 --> 01:40:24.522
<i>I heard there are very few people there.</i>

01:40:24.574 --> 01:40:27.605
<i>I wonder ...
what that feels like.</i>
