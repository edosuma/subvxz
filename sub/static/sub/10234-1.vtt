- Morning, Miss Mildred.
- Girl, you got my money?

02:02.873 --> 02:05.160
I get paid today. I'll have it
for you when I pick her up.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.832
Bye, baby.
Mommy loves you.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.661
- All right.
- Here you go.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.541
Don't you see me
trying to get to work?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.418
Harry, these ain't
nothing but bills.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.420
Just put 'em
in the box next time.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.173
Come on,
come on, come on.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.765
All right.
Have a good one.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.226
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mama.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.641
Cheryl, please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this. Please.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.223
Henry, you know we ride
this bus every day.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.773
- She is coming!
- Tell her come on.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.851
Tell her come on.
Tell her come on!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.652
You know what?
I'm moving the bus.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.861
- And I'll sue you and this bus company.
- Calm down.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.071
- You ain't suing nobody.
- You're not going anywhere!

02:45.165 --> 02:47.122
- Your donuts can wait!
- Don't you worry about my donuts.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.916
L'ma drive off.
Get out of the door.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.664
- She can't be late for work.
- We all gonna be late for work.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.621
And you shut up!
I don't know you.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.173
Cheryl, will you stop talking
to the patrons like that?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.672
Get out of the door.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.972
Don't you be cussing at me.

03:04.059 --> 03:07.051
Tell her to come on.
I'ma lose my job!

03:13.485 --> 03:15.271
- She's coming!
- Tell her come on.

03:17.573 --> 03:21.942
Oh! Thanks, Henry.
You're the best.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.867
You have something to say?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.784
Mm-hmm.
That's what I thought.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.334
Oh. Oh, God.

03:41.305 --> 03:45.264
Sorry. The kids were
running-- running late.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.682
I was not gonna
let him leave without you.

03:47.769 --> 03:52.309
Good looking out. You know
I can't afford to get docked.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.857
- What's all that?
- Bills.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.402
Brenda, has Michael given you
any money for your son?

03:58.488 --> 04:02.197
Don't ask. Oh, speaking of--
can you loan me $100?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.571
I've got to give
Miss Mildred something.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.527
She won't keep Lena
for me next week.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.953
Come on. I know.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.204
Okay, let me look at my bills
and I'll let you know.

04:12.294 --> 04:16.036
- Thank you.
- I may be able to give you a joint loan.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.874
- What is a joint loan?
- A loan from my joint money.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.051
Girl. You know what?
You insane.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.721
You know you ain't supposed
to be smoking that stuff

04:25.807 --> 04:28.185
- with your condition.
- Whatever.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.804
- What's that?
- It says my daddy died.

04:32.898 --> 04:37.142
No. Your daddy died?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.402
It says the funeral
is on Saturday.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.443
Ay, Brenda, I'm sorry.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.490
- I never met the man.
- Ah.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.909
And what is this here?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.863
Three bus tickets to Georgia.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.701
- Are you going?
- I don't know these people.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.913
They know you. How else would they
know where to send the tickets?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.384
Yeah, but there's four of us, huh?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.378
But that's a good question.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.628
And read this--

05:05.722 --> 05:07.929
there is a will.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.724
Oh my God, what if
he was superrich

05:10.811 --> 05:13.553
and left you millions
and millions of dollars?

05:13.647 --> 05:17.436
Right. I doubt that.
We never talked about him.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.018
You know, since she used
to do anything for money,

05:20.112 --> 05:23.446
if he was, believe me,
she'd have still been with him.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.741
I think you should go.
You never know, mami.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.114
- You never know.
- Girl.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.445
I ain't going to no Georgia.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.870
What the hell?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.752
What's going on?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.506
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.004
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.462
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's going on, girl?

05:47.556 --> 05:48.887
- Look.
- What happened?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.681
They shut the place down, Cheryl.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.303
They said they moved
the plant to Mexico.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.476
- Hurry!
- And they didn't tell us!

05:54.563 --> 05:56.645
- Move move!
- Go go! Come on!

05:56.732 --> 05:59.690
Wait! We were supposed
to get paid today!

06:01.903 --> 06:04.861
- I've got to pay my light bill today.
- Who has a match?!

06:04.948 --> 06:08.782
I'm going to burn this place down!
Who has a match?!

06:08.869 --> 06:11.031
Don't give this fool
no match. She bipolar.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.954
No, seriously. She gotta take
medication just to stay right.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.079
I know one of you have a match!
You smoke, Georgia!

06:17.169 --> 06:19.160
Give me a match.
Give it to me.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.794
Cheryl, put that out.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.173
Come on, I'm trying
to chill out.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.349
You know with your
chemical imbalance

06:34.436 --> 06:36.143
you're not supposed
to do drugs.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.482
- Did you take your medicine?
- I was trying to,

06:38.565 --> 06:40.852
but then you started talking
about "put that out."

06:40.942 --> 06:43.809
All right. I'm just
looking out for you.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.772
I'm fine. I just can't believe they
would do something like that.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.450
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, hi, Miss Mildred.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.528
- How you doing?
- Hi, Mildred.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.957
Miss Mildred to you.

06:58.043 --> 07:02.583
- Girl, you got my money?
- We lost ourjob today, Miss Mildred.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.754
Now I'm running a daycare,
not a welfare.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.879
You're running an illegal daycare,
so relax.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.007
Little girl, you don't know nothing
about my business.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.591
This is the last day.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.677
I'm not keeping your daughter
another minute.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.264
I'll come get her.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.349
She's taking a nap now.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.310
That's the trouble
with you young mothers--

07:26.404 --> 07:28.145
only think about yourselves.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.231
You just said
come get her.

07:30.325 --> 07:34.114
And I meant it--
after she wakes up and eats.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.451
- Okay.
- The child is sleeping.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.837
Thank you, Miss Mildred!

07:41.920 --> 07:45.003
- She's crazy.
- Naw, she's all right.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.208
Shoot. I don't know what
I'm gonna do now though.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.089
- She don't play with her money.
- Yeah, me neither.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.637
If I had known they were going
to close down the plant,

07:53.723 --> 07:57.182
I would have beat
my supervisors up yesterday.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.936
Well, what you gonna do?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.684
Shoot, I'm barely
getting by as it was.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.937
What you have to do is

08:06.027 --> 08:08.405
go and file child support
on that Michael.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.105
- Hm-mmm.
- You know that Jenny got

08:11.199 --> 08:13.315
$8,000 in back child support.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.072
They'll get it for you
and they'll kick his ass.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.781
8,000? Shoot.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.537
No, he'd kill me.

08:22.627 --> 08:26.086

Now don't worry
about that, Ma.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.721
I told the guys on the team
that they're my lucky shoes.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.225
I didn't know you
were coming.

But I can work

13:13.334 --> 13:16.122
Listen, baby, I thought
the same thing. Huh?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.748
I end up having
to drop out of school,

13:17.839 --> 13:19.921
working a bunch of dead-end jobs
just to make ends meet.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.919
I don't want you working.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.305
Hey.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.261
One thing a black woman
know how to do--

13:34.355 --> 13:36.813
that's make it. Hmm?

13:42.197 --> 13:45.064
- Yo, what's up, Mike?
- Hey, what's up, Cal?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.489
Chilling.
Good game tonight though.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.442
Thanks. Nice whip, man.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.527
I appreciate it, man.
I just bought this.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.284
It's my baby.
How you doing, Miss Brown?

13:53.374 --> 13:56.537
- Hey.
- Hey, we're going to kick it tonight,

13:56.628 --> 13:59.086
celebrate a little bit.
You want to roll with us?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.590
No, man. I've gotta walk
my mom and my sisters home.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.755
I can give y'all a ride.
You want a ride?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.304
- No.
- Okay.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.552
- Hey, Cal.
- Yes, ma'am?

14:11.643 --> 14:15.352
- Whose car is that?
- It's mine. I just bought this.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.645
Calvin, where you working?

14:17.732 --> 14:20.144
Hmm? Huh?

14:20.235 --> 14:23.478
You know your mama'd turn over
in her grave if she knew, don't you?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.733
All right all right,
I'll holler, man.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.315
- All right, man. You be easy.
- Come on, Ma.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.400
Bye, Miss Brown.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.908
I don't want you hanging with them boys.
I don't even want you talking to 'em.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.491
But, Ma, you know me and Calvin
been hanging since the third grade.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.962
Yeah, well, he done changed.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.911
And I don't want you
with him, all right?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.463
- But, Ma, Calvin's cool.
- Look, do you think I'm crazy?

14:43.550 --> 14:46.633
- Huh? Do you?
- No.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.505
Now I know them boys
is in the dope game.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.179
I don't want you with them.
Do you hear me?

14:51.266 --> 14:53.803
- Do you?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.100
All right.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.018
Come on, y'all.
Come on.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.659
- Hey. Mike?
- Yeah.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.708
I'm Harry Belton. Your coach wanted me
to fly up here and see you play.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.208
You're pretty good.
You've got a lot of potential.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.882
Potential?
That's what you call it?

15:26.968 --> 15:29.050
Who is this?
Who are you?

15:29.137 --> 15:32.050
I'm Harry. Mike's coach wanted me
to see your brother play.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.802
We run a camp in the summer
for high-school players.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.725
Are your parents around? I'd like
to talk to them about Mike attending.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.554
- I'm his mama.
- Nice try though.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.390
Oh. Uh, Mrs. Brown--

15:43.484 --> 15:45.737
- Miss.
- Miss Brown,

15:45.820 --> 15:48.653
can I take you to lunch

15:48.740 --> 15:50.731
so we can talk about Mike?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.692
What? No. Look, mister,
I don't know where you're from,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.652
but what his coach
should've told you

15:55.747 --> 15:58.705
is that I don't want Mike to even
think about basketball until after

15:58.791 --> 16:01.909
he gets into college, which, judging by
his grades, might not even happen.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.166
I agree. Grades are important,
especially the way Mike plays.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.543
Whoa whoa, what's that
supposed to mean?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.671
It means you're talented,
but talent's not enough.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.593
You need the right attitude
plus skill.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.420
Look, man.
Hold on, I got skills.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.097
Watch your mouth.
You know what?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.050
The reason that coach sent
you over here by yourself

16:18.144 --> 16:19.805
is 'cause he knows
he don't do nothing

16:19.896 --> 16:22.763
but tell these boys in this neighborhood
that they can make it to the pros.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.598
And when they end up
with their hearts broken

16:24.692 --> 16:26.148
they walk around here
mad at the world.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.442
That ain't happening
to my son, okay?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.781
So you're gonna
have to excuse me.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.775
I've got too much on my mind
to deal with this.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.198
Come on, Michael.
Come on.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.657
Potential? Huh.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.583
Girl, you got my money?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.966
No, but I was just wondering
if you could keep her

16:55.056 --> 16:57.297
forjust a few hours
while I try and go get it?

16:57.392 --> 16:59.133
Girl, do you think I'm crazy?

16:59.227 --> 17:02.219
Now you got to pay your money
like all the other mothers in here.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.893
Okay. Thank you.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.974
- Come on.
- Come on in here.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.241
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.864
Yes, you are. Quit lying.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.695
When you bring that baby,

17:20.790 --> 17:23.531
oh, she be starving,
so I know you must be too.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.742
Here, eat that.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.792
I don't know what's the matter
with you young girls

17:33.886 --> 17:36.423
having all these babies
you know you can't take care of.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.927
Look, I don't need no lecture from you.
I know what I've done.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.349
They're here now,
they're my responsibility.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.520
You know what?
Lena, come on. Let's go.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.734
Oh, sit down, girly.
I'm just talking to you.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.482
Eat and settle down.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.409
Eat.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.705
- You're a good mother.
- Huh!

18:03.791 --> 18:07.375
I've got enough bad ones running
through here to know that.

18:07.462 --> 18:10.545
Now what is
going on with you?

18:14.218 --> 18:17.131
I don't know.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.594
Somehow I always managed
to make it through,

18:24.687 --> 18:28.021
but now it's just
getting harder and harder.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.395
It ain't somehow,
it's the Lord.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.228
And all that means is you're getting
close to a breakthrough.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.905
Till then you just keep praying.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.153
<i>L</i> pray-

18:39.243 --> 18:41.575
<i>I</i> try to pray

18:41.662 --> 18:43.244
and I try to live right,

18:43.331 --> 18:46.073
but where's it getting me?
Look at me.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.330
If you had seen the look
on my babies' faces

18:49.420 --> 18:51.502
when that man turned
my lights off--

18:51.589 --> 18:53.330
Now you listen to me.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.542
Don't you ever get tired
of doing the right thing,

18:56.636 --> 18:59.799
'cause in the end,
that's what pays off.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.597
You're the best mother
I have seen,

19:02.683 --> 19:05.061
that's why I'm gonna
keep that baby.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.099
Oh.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.556
I wouldn't do that
for these other ones here.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.766
At least they can afford
to pay you, Miss Mildred.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.238
Huh! Honey, I don't
want to know half

19:15.321 --> 19:18.154
of what they're doing
to get that money.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.782
Go on now.
Take that with you.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.371
Thank you,
just a couple of hours.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.294
I swear.
Thank you, Miss Mildred.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.051
All right.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.183
Hold it. Ladies, ladies,

19:51.274 --> 19:53.936
you can't be here.
This is a hard-hat area.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.270
Oh. Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Rose.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.776
- Is he here?
- Who's asking?

20:00.867 --> 20:04.326
- Brenda.
- Well, he's busy.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.530
Man, look here.
You'd better go find him.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.536
I'm his baby mama,
and if I don't find him,

20:10.626 --> 20:13.209
you are going to regret it.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.264
- I don't see him, anyway.
- Go take care of this, all right?

20:26.350 --> 20:27.761
Wait wait wait wait wait.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.093
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, man.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.483
Brenda, what are
you doing here?

20:37.570 --> 20:40.858
I've been calling you.
You haven't returned my calls.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.859
You know, this job
pays me $25 an hour.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.452
I'm busy.
What do you want?

20:45.453 --> 20:47.490
I lost my job, Michael.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.662
- I ain't got no money.
- Michael...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.081
I've been raising
your son by myself

20:52.168 --> 20:54.284
and in 17 years I ain't never
asked you for nothing.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.712
You know, now I just need
a little help.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.460
- I ain't got no money.
- Well, you'd better go find some,

21:00.551 --> 21:02.883
'cause your kids
are hungry, you fool.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.257
- Who the hell is she?
- My name is Child Welfare,

21:05.348 --> 21:07.339
and I'm gonna lock you up.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.141
- Are you threatening me?
- Oh, yeah. What, you don't know

21:10.227 --> 21:11.843
when someone is
threatening you, huh?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.521
Mike-- Michael, look.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.769
They turned my lights off,
all right?

21:16.859 --> 21:20.068
Your son, he needs some--
some clothes.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.895
- I told you.
- Could you--

21:21.989 --> 21:25.357
could you just give me
some money for food?

21:25.451 --> 21:27.533
I'll tell you what-- y'all need
to take your <i>asses</i> on

21:27.620 --> 21:30.487
and don't you come
to my job no more.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.037
Huh! Heh.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.868
Come on.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.330
- Let's go.
- Okay.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.927
I'll be right there.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.219
- Cheryl.
- You all right?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.172
- Run. Run!
- Oh my God!

21:54.647 --> 21:57.184
I can't go anywhere
with you, Cheryl!

21:57.274 --> 21:59.936
- You could've hit him in the head.
- So? He deserved it!

22:00.027 --> 22:02.564
- You're going to jail.
- Ay, I don't care.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.817
I've been there, mamacita.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.989
<i>N, we need money.</i>

22:07.076 --> 22:08.908
You need money.
I'm gonna rob a bank.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.611
Come on, be serious.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.698
Cheryl, why are
you so crazy?

22:14.792 --> 22:17.454
Because it's fun,
because I like it.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.958
You know what? I've been thinking
a lot about your father.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.540
I think you really should
go down there to Georgia.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.500
- What if he left you something?
- No, Cheryl.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.722
Come on. Why not?

22:29.432 --> 22:32.345
Because I'm tired of getting my hopes up
for things that don't happen.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.097
So what? You have nothing
to lose right now.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.471
Come on, there's the bus.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.838
Watch your step.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.583
Watch your step there.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.460
All right,
have a good day now.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.187
This is country.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.605
You can say that again.

23:21.692 --> 23:24.434
Looks like we gonna
see slaves at any minute.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.610
She look like she about
to fight somebody.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.109
Uh, excuse me,
you must be Brenda.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.361
I told you.
It's Chicken George.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.537
- Yeah.
- I knowed it! I knowed--

23:36.624 --> 23:38.206
I said to myself--
I said, "Self."

23:38.292 --> 23:40.499
Myself said, "Hmm?"
I said, "That's Brenda.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.169
That's got to be her." All these peoples,
I picked you out--

23:43.255 --> 23:46.793
looked you in the face.
Girl, I'm Leroy Brown.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.216
- Hi.
- My friends call me Leroy Brown.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.089
- You can just call me--
- Leroy Brown?

23:51.180 --> 23:52.545
Yeah yeah,
how'd you know?

23:52.640 --> 23:56.178
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.054
- This is my baby.
- Nice to meet you too.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.887
Oh, look at you!
Hey, who are you?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.972
Mommy, I like the clown.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.024
He looks like a flag.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.978
- Yeah.
- Leroy Brown?

24:08.072 --> 24:10.154
You, um-- you must be I.B.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.152
Oh no, that's my brother
Larry Brown.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.984
They just call him--
they call him I.B.

24:14.078 --> 24:17.036
Mm-hmm. That's my oldest brother
on my daddy's side.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.114
He told me to come
by here and get y'all.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.119
Yeah. Y'all ready to go?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.577
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Grab your stuff. Let's go.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.662
Oh, I'm glad
y'all made it safely.

24:25.756 --> 24:28.088
Come on. You need
some help with that?

24:28.175 --> 24:30.257
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Here, Cora, hold that.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.881
My back is messed up.
Y'all be careful now.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.340
L.B., he was gonna come to get y'all,
but he had to go somewhere.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.174
He had to go to Bingo,
I think. You see--

24:38.269 --> 24:39.759
Ooh, Lord.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.970
If y'all feel some jerking,
that's my transmission.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.566
It just "snips" sometimes.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.641
I got it fixed at church
the other day. Yeah.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.272
- So how was your ride?
- Oh, it was fine.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.445
- Yes, thank you.
- When my-- I.B. told me

24:51.532 --> 24:54.115
I needed to come get you,
he said you's a friend of the family.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.942
I said I'm gonna go get her,

24:56.036 --> 24:58.198
'cause she's a friend of him,
he's a friend of mine.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.405
That's all right.
So where you from?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.536
- Um, Chicago.
- Chicago.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.539
Chicago! That's where them big
buildings is, ain't it?

25:05.629 --> 25:07.290
Yeah, they got
a lot of big buildings.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.373
- Ain't that where that S-- Serus Tower?
- The Sears Tower.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.209
Yeah, my daddy...
my daddy just loved it there.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.842
He had a-- he was there
and everything. I miss my daddy.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.468
It's going to be
all right, Mr. Brown.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.220
I just can't take it.
Lord, take the wheel.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.893
I want you to look
at the road, Mr. Brown!

25:21.979 --> 25:23.811
Get the wheel!

25:23.898 --> 25:27.061
- Chicago's a nice town.
- Yeah, I like it.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.392
- Mm-hmm.
- See, she likes it.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.978
- I couldn't live there.
- Would you look at the road?

25:32.072 --> 25:35.030
Huh-uh, gimme the South.
Yes, I like the trees of the South.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.485
I don't like it. There's too much
smog and stuff there.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.320
- Yeah?
- My daddy liked it though.

25:40.414 --> 25:43.156
- It's okay, Mr. Brown.
- He was always in Chicago.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.457
It's all right. I want you
to watch the road.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.455
Oh wait, now watch the road!

25:47.546 --> 25:50.004
He just taught me so much.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.831
He taught me how
to dance and swim.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.213
Imiss him.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.850
- Now this is when he was a young boy.
- Mm-hmm.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.520
Oh, he was so handsome.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.893
Now over here...

26:07.983 --> 26:10.190
- this is when he married.
- That's my mama.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.563
Oh, wow.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.691
So how you know our daddy?

26:13.781 --> 26:17.524
- Well, my mama--
- Where is everybody? Oh!

26:17.618 --> 26:19.609
- Here we go.
- Y'all Daddy go.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.785
Oh, Lord, help me.
Help me.

26:21.872 --> 26:25.035
Vera, will you get somewhere
and sit down without all that drama?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.207
Go on, y'all, daddy dead!

26:27.294 --> 26:29.251
Vera, get ahold
of yourself now.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.376
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do, y'all.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.457
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.838
- You want some cake?
- Oh, yes, cake would help.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.717
That would definitely help me.
Got any rum in that?

26:39.807 --> 26:41.172
I don't know. Here you go.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.555
Oh Lord, who's this big
yellow woman blinding me?

26:44.645 --> 26:47.888
Good Lord, eclipse.
Ecfipse!

26:47.982 --> 26:50.770
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Your daughter?!

26:50.859 --> 26:54.898
Brown, I didn't know
your soldiers marched.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.071
Yeah, you remember in school

26:57.157 --> 26:59.990
and you had on them tight pants,
you had a pencil stuck in the pocket?

27:00.077 --> 27:02.865
And then he fell.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.243
- Instant vasectomy.
- D'oh!

27:06.333 --> 27:09.246
That ain't funny.
I got lead poisoning...

27:09.336 --> 27:10.918
on my privacy.

27:11.005 --> 27:14.043
- Good one.
- You do look a little familiar.

27:14.133 --> 27:18.468
- Who's your mama?
- Oh, um... Madea.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.636
Madea!

27:25.561 --> 27:28.553
- Brown, that's just nasty.
- Oh, you don't know my mother.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.184
You gonna roll up on me?
Hell to the no!

27:31.275 --> 27:33.061
I got my purse.
I got something for you.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.393
- Bring it!
- Don't go gospel gangster on her, baby.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.818
Just relax.
That's your Aunt Vera.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.691
What? Ain't no auntie of mine
acting like that.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.898
- She drinks and smokes.
- Sit down.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.950
- Sit down.
- You can't tell me to calm.

27:43.037 --> 27:45.574
- Please excuse my mother.
- Oh, this is your cousin Will.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.122
- He a doctor-- a "gonorrheacologist."
- Oh!

27:49.460 --> 27:52.077
- A gynecologist.
- Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.832
Same thing.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.300
Brown, I want to know
what these strangers

27:56.383 --> 27:58.875
are doing here
during our time of bereavement.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.462
- Vera, don't be so mean!
- How are y'all doing? I'm Will.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.093
- Vera's son.
- Hello.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.141
Who are you?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.771
Lena and Tosha.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.818
Brenda came down
for the funeral.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.567
- Where'd she come from?
- Chicago.

28:20.657 --> 28:24.241
Daddy! Daddy!

28:24.328 --> 28:27.571
- Okay, Ma.
- My daddy lived in Chicago long ago.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.496
Help me, Jesus!

28:29.583 --> 28:32.701
Come on, y'all. I'm gonna show you
where you're gonna sleep.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.503
- Oh, thank you.
- Just go on up the stairs

28:35.589 --> 28:38.126

- See you later.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.673
- Good night.
- Mm-hmm.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.594
And, Vera, you all can sleep
in Pop Brown's old room.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.844
Oh, now I ain't sleeping in some room
some dead man died in.

28:47.935 --> 28:51.053
I've been sleeping
with a dead man for years.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.281
- Hey!

29:09.665 --> 29:11.952
No. It's my hometown.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.875
- What are you doing here?
- Minding my business.

29:14.962 --> 29:18.171
Oh yes, that's Harry.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.375
Yo, hey, Harry!

29:21.468 --> 29:23.300

29:23.387 --> 29:24.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.504
Sorry to hear
about your daddy.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.465
Oh, it's okay. People's dying
that ain't never died before.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.551
Yeah, he's in a better place now.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.010
Mm-hmm, he gone to heaven.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.891
What's up, Harry?
How you doing, man?

29:34.982 --> 29:36.598
- Big Will!
- Long time no see.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.808
- I know.
- Thanks for coming. What's going on?

29:38.902 --> 29:40.404
Just came by to pay
my condolences.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.319
Oh, you ain't got to pay
for nothing.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.147
We got $25,
everything is covered.

29:44.241 --> 29:47.074
Yeah, Daddy left a big insurance
policy for that much.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.118
Hey, Mike, I was watching you
from upstairs.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.740
- You're pretty good.
- Oh, thanks.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.413
He just needs
to watch his elbow.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.001
Who are you to be
giving me advice?

29:54.084 --> 29:56.291
Mike, this is Harry Belton--

29:56.378 --> 29:58.915
high-school all-American,
college standout.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.373
And a pretty good professional player
until he retired.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.255
- I ain't never heard of him.
- You ain't never heard of him?

30:04.344 --> 30:08.133
Where you been? All you know is that
young boy "Lebanon" James, ain't it?

30:08.223 --> 30:10.760
Gimme the basketball,
I'm gonna show you-- whoa!

30:10.851 --> 30:13.639
- That's nice, Uncle Brown.
- You done scratched my suit.

30:15.606 --> 30:18.473
Harry's a high-school coach
here now and college recruiter

30:18.567 --> 30:21.559
and does camps and develops
talent over the summer, right?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.111
- Yep.
- Oh, the coach of Hillbilly High, huh?

30:24.198 --> 30:25.780
Oooh, you're so "disrespected."

30:25.866 --> 30:28.324
And arrogant.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.526
We've got some
talented kids like you.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.454
But they listen, so that would
make 'em better than you.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.998
Please.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.791
Oooh, you arrogant.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.170
- Still got it.
- "Squish"!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.667
- "Squish."
- One on one.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.715
- Do it.
- All right.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.792
You got some money?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.670
I don't gamble.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.972
Me neither. I'm safe.
I'ma-- I got knicks.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.302
I'm gonna change into my good clothes.
You don't know nothing about basketball.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.385
Check it out.
Come on.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.356
Whoo, I'm just coming in here
to keep y'all company.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.150
Don't ask me to cook nothing.
Last time I was in the kitchen

31:03.237 --> 31:05.069
I burned myself
and cut myself.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.987
Chile, slow down.
Dinner gonna be in a while.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.865
Vera, don't start.

31:12.955 --> 31:17.449
- Your mama don't feed you?
- Sometimes we don't have enough to eat.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.958
- Really?
- Well, you just eat all you want here.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.754
You hear?
We got plenty.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.456
That's right.
Miss Sarah's a great cook.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.383
Look like you been
eating here for years.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.709
Oh look, you don't know me.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.590
- You gonna make me go in my purse.
- Do it.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.388
- Don't hurt me, baby.
- You want some more, baby?

31:32.474 --> 31:36.092
I'd love to, but I gotta save
some for my sister and brother.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.598
Well, it look like you ate it all.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.431
Oooh, wow.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.108
Something sure smells good.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.523
- Uh, Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

31:47.614 --> 31:50.026
I didn't mean to eat it all.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.324
It was just so good.
I'm sorry.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.152
Oh, honey, don't be upset.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.738
Old mean Vera here
was just kidding.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.870
We got plenty.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.746
Tosha, sweetheart,

32:01.837 --> 32:04.124
do me a favor,
go check on your sister.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.965
- So sweet.
- Yeah.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.042
I'm sorry. We've just been
having it...

32:10.137 --> 32:11.923
- kinda rough lately.
- Mm-hmm.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.346
Well, get up there.
Have a seat. Sit down, honey.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.265
- Take a load off.
- Come on.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.638
- Thank you.
- Here.

32:18.729 --> 32:21.346
Oh, thanks.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.058
I lost my job lately, but even
before then, it was-- it was--

32:25.152 --> 32:27.189
it was kinda tough.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.192
- God will make a way. Won't He, Sarah?
- Mm-hmm.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.023
Sure wanna believe that.

32:32.117 --> 32:36.076
You must believe it, baby,
and don't you be ashamed to speak out.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.404
We got your back.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.536
'Cause I remember when my
husband died, if it wasn't for family,

32:41.627 --> 32:44.164
I don't know how me and my two girls
would have made it.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.245
I don't have much family.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.423
- Where these kids' daddy at?
- They're not in our lives.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.921
- They?!
- Vera.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.546
- Yeah, they.
- As in...

32:55.641 --> 32:57.757
more than one?

32:57.851 --> 33:00.434
- Three.
- Vera.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.103
Stay out of her business.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.101
Well...

33:05.192 --> 33:08.105
I wasn't trying to get in her business.
I'm gonna help her out.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.277
Here, this should help
you get a little bit.

33:10.364 --> 33:13.732
- Uh, no no no. I can't take that.
- It's the South, baby.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.611
You can take it.
It'll help out a little bit.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.363
No no no, thank you.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.368
I'm gonna go
check on my kids.

33:25.212 --> 33:29.331
Vera! $10, Vera? $10!

33:29.424 --> 33:31.256
What is she gonna do
with $10, Vera?

33:31.343 --> 33:34.631
First of all, she gonna buy
that kid a box of perm.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.964
- You see that child's head?!
- She has dreads.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.470
Dreads.
Let me spell that for you:

33:40.560 --> 33:43.803
N-A-P-P-Y.
Pshh!

33:47.484 --> 33:49.145
Uh-oh, watch the tree.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.227
All right, this game's points.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.905
- Be nice to him. Don't be--
- Whoa whoa whoa.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.483
- Oh!
- Oooh!

33:57.577 --> 34:00.114
What happened?

34:00.205 --> 34:02.367
- Oh, I see what happened.
- Hey!

34:02.457 --> 34:04.664
- Did you win?
- You know it, Mama.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.128
Aw, that's my baby.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.713
You said you want some of this?

34:07.796 --> 34:10.504
I got on my clothes,
my basketball clothes. You ready?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.456
Come on.
Gimme the ball.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.509
You-- don't stand there
looking like you ain't never seen this.

34:15.594 --> 34:18.462
Come on.
You wanna play?

34:20.934 --> 34:22.174
Hey.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.677
Hey.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.012
Harry, Brenda;
Brenda, Harry.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.518
Harry's a friend of the family.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.474
- We met already.
- Oh yeah?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.775
In Chicago. She kicked me
out of her house...

34:32.862 --> 34:35.696
when I told her her son had
potential to play pro ball.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.523
And what, you didn't
believe him?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.574
If Harry says it's true,
then it's the truth.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.618
So, what, you decided
to stalk us?

34:41.705 --> 34:43.696
No.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.871
- This is where I live.
- What?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.699
Harry, you see him foul me?

34:47.793 --> 34:49.831
You fouled me. Didn't--
you seen him, Harry?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.422
He fouled me.
You hit me on the leg.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.417
Excuse me.
Let me go ref this game.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.216
Game point!

34:56.303 --> 34:58.385
I'd still like to take
you out to lunch.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.759
Dinner's ready, you guys.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.385
That's my cue.
I'm coming, Cora!

35:02.476 --> 35:04.262
Ooh.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.226
Michael, come on. It's time
for dinner. I need you to wash up.

35:09.316 --> 35:13.230
- All right.
- It was really good seeing you again.

35:14.488 --> 35:15.899
Harry.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.401
_ Huh?
_ Harry-

35:18.492 --> 35:20.824
Harry.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.243
Sly dog. Ha ha ha!

35:23.330 --> 35:25.492
- I'll talk to you after dinner.
- Whoa whoa whoa!

35:25.582 --> 35:26.993
Man, hey hey.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.415
You didn't hear that?

35:29.503 --> 35:31.995
What, is that your way of asking
to stay for dinner?

35:32.088 --> 35:34.796
- Why, thank you.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.923
If you trying to holler at her, man, you
need to come out of that sweaty shirt.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.924
Right.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.222
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.016
Hey, I'll save you a seat.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.390
- Hey, right next to her.
- All right.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.564
And that was when we all
cried like babies.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.858
You don't know how
to tell no stories.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.312
L.B., Vera, y'all remember when

35:57.405 --> 35:59.271
Daddy tried to teach us
how to swim?

35:59.366 --> 36:01.448
- No, I don't remember that.
- Oh, I remember.

36:01.535 --> 36:04.118
I remember it because it was
like it was yesterday.

36:04.204 --> 36:08.619
I remember it was
Christmas Eve, 19...

36:08.708 --> 36:09.743
1940-something,
whatever.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.451
I remember.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.286
Daddy said he couldn't get us
nothing for Christmas.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.462
So he come in and he said,
"I'm gonna get the truck ready."

36:15.549 --> 36:17.756
- He loaded up horse on the truck.
- Uh-huh.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.459
You know, we ain't have
no engine in the truck.

36:19.553 --> 36:22.295
We just had a, you know,
old one-horsepower truck.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.754
- That was the horse.
- Giddy-up.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.305
Yeah, giddy-up, giddy-UP-

36:25.392 --> 36:28.680
We went down to that river.
I didn't want to jump in right off.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.602
That water was 50-below zero!

36:30.689 --> 36:32.600
<i>- Whoa'.
- Shdnufi.</i>

36:32.691 --> 36:35.558
Daddy got out there and he said,
"Get in the water!"

36:35.652 --> 36:37.814
And I said, "I ain't
getting in that water!"

36:37.904 --> 36:39.861
And he looked at me, he had
an extension cord in his hand.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.404
I didn't want to be no disobedient.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.108
So I got to that water
and I looked at it,

36:44.202 --> 36:47.661
and I teenched up there
and then I teeter-tottered.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.613
- Whoo.
- I teeter-tottered.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.325
Teeter-totter, next thing
you know...

36:52.419 --> 36:54.251
bang!

36:55.839 --> 36:58.331
I never learned to swim.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.042
I couldn't get the rhythm
of the stroke.

37:01.136 --> 37:04.128
Why is it that I felt
that I might choke?

37:04.222 --> 37:07.340
Mr. Brown is crazy.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.597
Harry, how is your mother?

37:10.687 --> 37:13.304
- She's good.
- Uh-huh.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.186
I'm glad she's good 'cause I know
she almost had a heart attack

37:16.276 --> 37:19.189
when she heard about all that trouble
you were in with all that illegal--

37:19.279 --> 37:20.861
Mama! Want some cake?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.858
Gimme the part
where they got that rum

37:22.949 --> 37:25.782
sopped up in there. Gimme that piece.
Gimme just that rum piece.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.359
I'm just glad to see you all right

37:27.454 --> 37:30.162
'cause I was praying for you.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.410
That prayer didn't get
no higher than the ceiling.

37:34.127 --> 37:36.710
- Mom.
- What, baby?

37:36.796 --> 37:39.083
- I got a tummy ache.
- Oh, honey,

37:39.174 --> 37:41.165
that's probably
because you ate too much.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.842
- Let me get you something.
- Don't worry about it, Ma.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.761
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.929
Young man, you know
where you going?

37:48.016 --> 37:50.007
Oh, yes, sir.
Excuse me a minute.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.058
Come on, Mike.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.510
All right. Night, baby.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.595
- Good night.
- Night.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.066
- Night.
- Later, Mike.

37:56.149 --> 37:59.232
Brenda, he seems like
such a nice young man.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.809
Thank you. He is.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.565
I couldn't make it without him.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.068
You know what? Now just a minute,
just a minute.

38:05.158 --> 38:09.117
I'm just curious. Anybody else at this
table want to know who this woman is?

38:09.204 --> 38:13.789
- Vera!
- All day y'all been skirting the issue.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.082
I want to know
who this woman is.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.752
- Mama--
- No no, uh uh uh uh!

38:18.838 --> 38:21.091
Who are you?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.679
Well, um...

38:28.765 --> 38:32.679
apparently Pop Brown
was my daddy.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.760
- What?
- Huh-uh, you's a liar.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.561
Apparently nothing.
You a liar!

38:36.648 --> 38:38.389
Huh-uh, the devil is a liar.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.942
Oh, hell to the no.
My daddy wasn't no rolling stone.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.689
Well, that's what
my mama said.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.442
- Who's your mama?
- Her name was Carol Cassidy.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.069
I don't know no Cassidy.
Who's that?

38:49.619 --> 38:51.451
I ain't got no reason
not to tell the truth.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.779
W-wait a minute.
I got something.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.205
Yeah, let's see what you got.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.545
Look at her.
She does lookjust like us.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.336
Look, I'm the baby of this family.
She ain't coming up in here.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.040
All that attitude and carrying on.
"We're from Chicago."

39:04.134 --> 39:05.795
What you got, girl?

39:05.885 --> 39:08.502
I got this letter and it
told me to come down here.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.883
Let me see this.
It's I.B.'s writing.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.056
- I.B., what the hell is this?
- I.B.?

39:13.143 --> 39:15.475
- What the hell is it?
- What's going on, I.B.?

39:15.562 --> 39:18.930
- Yeah, I.B., what's going on?
- I know all about this.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.732
Papa Brown been talking
to you about her?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.105
Yes, her and her mother.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.277
You see, when Pop Brown
got real sick,

39:26.364 --> 39:30.028
he started to tell me everything
about his past life.

39:30.118 --> 39:34.112
You know, before he got saved
and became a deacon.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.991
So you mean to tell me--

39:36.082 --> 39:38.119
you have a sister?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.120
Yep, and her mother

39:40.211 --> 39:42.589
was the love of his life
in Chicago.

39:42.672 --> 39:44.254
Oh, really?

39:44.340 --> 39:46.502
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Huh-uh-uh!

39:46.593 --> 39:48.755
'Cause I don't agree.
What are you saying?

39:48.845 --> 39:51.382
You see, when Pop Brown
was in Chicago,

39:51.473 --> 39:53.089
he was a pimp.

39:53.183 --> 39:56.141
And her mother was
his bottom ho.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.559
You don't talk
about my daddy.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.853
Hell to the no,
this is blasphemy.

40:00.940 --> 40:04.308
L.B., you don't talk about my daddy
like this, not at the dinner table.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.940
- Our daddy was a saint.
- Your daddy was a pimp!

40:09.699 --> 40:13.033
He was not a pim-- my daddy
used to date nice women.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.076
- Remember sweet Sadie?
- Yes.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.746
- Good girl.
- She was one of his whores.

40:17.832 --> 40:21.245
- Ho ho.
- What about Agnes with the freckles?

40:21.336 --> 40:23.247
She was a good girl-- Agnes.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.713
Freckle-faced ho.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.711
What about Arnette?

40:30.053 --> 40:33.296
- Latin ho.
- What about Tommy Lee?

40:34.474 --> 40:36.841
- Backdoor whore.
- What about Shirley?

40:36.935 --> 40:39.643
Shirley, the one that used to make
cupcakes for me when I was a child.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.437
Please don't tell me Shirley was no ho.
What about Shirley?

40:42.524 --> 40:45.312
- City ho.
- Miss Edna?

40:45.401 --> 40:47.859
She's a double ho.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.064
What about I.B. mama?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.238
L.B.?

40:55.328 --> 40:59.492
Nasty ho.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.994
Ain't nothing going
on here but the truth.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.459
Brenda, you sure you okay?

41:08.550 --> 41:10.211
Oh yeah. I'll be fine.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.554
But it's a good thing
this funeral's tomorrow

41:12.637 --> 41:16.175
- so I can get out of here.
- Let me welcome you to the Brown family.

41:16.266 --> 41:20.430
- Some welcome.
- I know it.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.807
This is getting pretty full.
I should take it out.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.604
Oh, okay. You sure
you want to do that?

41:24.691 --> 41:26.853
- Yeah, where?
- Just take it right out front.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.442
Ladies, I'm gonna say
good night.

41:33.533 --> 41:36.651
- Well, good night.
- Nice meeting you.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.156
Nice meeting you too.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.710
- Hey, let me help you with that.
- Oh, I got it.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.505
Around here men do that.

41:50.592 --> 41:53.050
Where I'm from women do it all.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.056
Well, then maybe
you should live here.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.054
God forbid.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.308
What?
What's wrong with my town?

42:05.398 --> 42:08.686
- You call this a town?
- Yeah.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.188
It's calming.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.895
It's too quiet here.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.777
Then maybe you should let me
show you how great a town it is.

42:15.867 --> 42:19.701
You know, I'm here for my father's funeral
and you're flirting with me.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.949
That is in poor taste.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.202
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.209
Good night.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.037
Good night.

42:45.563 --> 42:49.522
Well, we are here today to say

42:49.609 --> 42:52.522
- goodbye...
- Lord, that's my daddy!

42:52.612 --> 42:54.523
...to one of our dear
beloved sons.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.605
Daddy, you should've
let me go with you!

42:56.699 --> 42:58.360
Daddy!

42:58.451 --> 43:01.785
Mom, Mom, take it easy.
Sit down, Mom.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.828
And I need you to understand

43:03.915 --> 43:07.579
that God will see you
through all this, sister.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.667
What the hell does
he got on his head?

43:12.757 --> 43:16.216
- And you must realize that...
- Monster, Mama, monster.

43:16.302 --> 43:19.636
- Baby, it's all right.
- ...in this hour of bereavement,

43:19.722 --> 43:23.056
there is such
a word as comfort.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.930
Yeah, Southern Comfort!
Yes, sir!

43:26.020 --> 43:28.682
- Hmph
- And God is faithful

43:28.773 --> 43:32.482
- to do exactly what he says he's gonna do.
- Preacher? Excuse me, Pastor?

43:32.568 --> 43:34.980
He do, He do!

43:35.071 --> 43:36.232
Psst!

43:36.322 --> 43:38.063
- Put me on the program.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.239
I wanted to say something
about my daddy.

43:40.326 --> 43:43.068
- Don't, please.
- You can put me on program.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.903
I'm trying to do
the sermon, please.

43:44.998 --> 43:47.911
- I'm preaching right now.
- You ain't doing no--

43:48.001 --> 43:50.459
you ain't doing no good job.
You're boring everybody.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.162
Look at my daddy's face.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.965
Deacon, he dead.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.544
- Put me on the program.
- I need to finish my sermon.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.754
- Remember that--
- Psst!

44:02.849 --> 44:05.466
You can let me say something
about my daddy. He my daddy.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.222
- Is he your daddy? Act like he your daddy.
- All right.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.429
- Just put me on the program.
- Come on.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.355
- Oh, Daddy!
- All right.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.729
Now I have more to say,
but right now

44:14.819 --> 44:16.901
his son Leroy Brown

44:16.988 --> 44:19.446
has a few words
that he wants to say.

44:19.532 --> 44:22.115
Leroy Brown, come on
and say something

44:22.201 --> 44:23.453
right up on that.

44:23.536 --> 44:25.152
- Me?
- Oh yes.

44:25.246 --> 44:27.157
- What?
- Let's go. Come on now.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.580
- Shut your mouth. Is he sure?
- Yes, Deacon.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.204
- They want me to say something?
- Come on up here, Deacon.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.535
I don't know what to say.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.290
You want me to say
something, I.B.?

44:35.381 --> 44:37.873
- Till we all dead.
- Okay.

44:37.967 --> 44:40.208
I'm "nerveless."

44:40.303 --> 44:43.921
I didn't plan on saying
nothing today.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.804
I just was in my room and I
jotted down a few things.

44:47.894 --> 44:50.636
- Can y'all hear me?
- Go on, Brown. Go on, baby.

44:50.730 --> 44:53.472
Is this on?

44:53.566 --> 44:55.148
It's on.

44:55.234 --> 44:58.818
I didn't plan on saying nothing.
Let the church say "amend."

44:58.905 --> 45:03.149
- Amen.
- Let the church say "amend" again.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.824
Amen.

45:04.911 --> 45:08.825
I want to let everybody know
today that Daddy died happy.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.953
He was happy...
I'm gonna miss my daddy.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.659
Bye-bye, Daddy.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.619
My daddy loved his people...

45:15.755 --> 45:19.669
I'm getting sick of this. It don't take nobody
that long to put nobody in the ground.

45:19.759 --> 45:22.592
- Stay calm, stay calm.
- I am calm. I'm just sick of it.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.670
He'll always be right here, y'all,

45:25.765 --> 45:27.221
right here in my heart.

45:27.308 --> 45:30.801
And I won't chatter no--
this ain't no funeral.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.102
- This is a "celebrate."
- Yeah!

45:33.189 --> 45:35.601
And we here to celebrate Daddy.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.853
And I'm telling y'all today,

45:37.944 --> 45:40.811
- my daddy was a happy man.
- Sit down!

45:40.905 --> 45:43.146
- That's what we need--
- Sit down, Brown!

45:43.241 --> 45:46.029
--More superheroes in this church.
We need peoples

45:46.119 --> 45:48.486
that'll stand up and be
heroes for the Lord.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.287
- That's enough.
- Show him, baby.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.536

You wanna go with her?
There's room for you too, you know?

46:40.173 --> 46:41.834
I'll wait.

46:43.468 --> 46:46.961
I'm the baby of this family
and I deserve some respect.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.432
- Right.
- I.B. pushed me in that grave.

46:49.515 --> 46:50.926
I know, Mama. I know.

46:51.017 --> 46:53.133
Everybody's act a fool.

46:53.227 --> 46:56.185
Should have let them put the dirt
on you too-- acting a damn fool.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.604
- Calm down, everybody.
- That's just crazy!

46:58.691 --> 46:59.931
Uh, hey, y'all.

47:00.026 --> 47:02.267
It was nice meeting
all of you, but, um...

47:02.361 --> 47:04.227
- I think we're gonna go now.
- Oh no.

47:04.322 --> 47:07.860
You have to stay till tomorrow
for the reading of the will.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.658
- Yeah.
- No! Daddy ain't left her nothing.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.781
No, um, I really think
we ought to be going.

47:15.875 --> 47:17.912
You can't leave, baby,

47:18.002 --> 47:21.290
'cause... the bus only
come every three days.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.293
- It'll be here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, what?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.966
- It'll be okay.
- No no!

47:27.053 --> 47:29.340
I gotta go.
I-- no--

47:29.430 --> 47:31.512
You know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

47:31.599 --> 47:34.261
I'm gonna go change and I'm gonna
be back in 15 minutes.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.309
I'm gonna take you
and your kids

47:36.395 --> 47:38.727
to see my town.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.270
Ah-- you'll like it.

47:43.361 --> 47:46.524
- I promise.
- Okay okay okay.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.855
- Okay, all right. Okay, all right.
- 15 minutes.

47:48.950 --> 47:51.408
- All right.
- Oh my God.

47:51.494 --> 47:54.532
All right, you know
I don't know you that well,

47:54.622 --> 47:57.205
but you'd better
watch out for him. Pshaw!

47:57.291 --> 47:59.828
Flashing that pretty smile...

47:59.919 --> 48:02.331
and that nickel-slick talk.

48:02.421 --> 48:06.039
He done broke a lot of women's hearts
out here in these backwoods.

48:08.469 --> 48:11.006
You be careful... sister.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.634
Brenda.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.557
- Brown, where you all at?
- We over here.

48:16.644 --> 48:18.851
Where that money
you owe me?

48:20.273 --> 48:21.763
- I'm gonna give you two.
- Thank you.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.144
Thank you. Gracias.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.351
You didn't know
I spoke Spanish, did you?

48:26.445 --> 48:28.698
Oooh, you should have
got one.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.488
See, it's not so bad.

48:31.534 --> 48:33.150
Hey, Harry.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.903
- Hey.
- Mmm.

48:36.998 --> 48:38.955
One of your women?

48:39.041 --> 48:41.703
- No, it's my cousin.
- Oh.

48:41.794 --> 48:44.752
That don't mean nothing
down here, do it?

48:45.965 --> 48:47.956
Oh ho.

48:48.050 --> 48:50.132
That's cold.

48:50.219 --> 48:53.211
I'm kidding.

48:53.306 --> 48:55.889
_ Hi!
_ Hi!

48:55.975 --> 48:58.888
Hi, baby! Oh.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.685
They're having fun.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.183
Yeah.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.230
Why don't you have
a woman, anyway?

49:08.321 --> 49:10.983
- Huh?
- I'm divorced.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.984
Ooooh.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.533
Six years, three kids

49:15.620 --> 49:17.611
and a whole lot of drama.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.742
My drama trumps your drama.

49:26.255 --> 49:28.713
Hey, step right up,
step right up.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.882
Who can get the ball in the basket?
How about you, young man?

49:31.969 --> 49:33.801
- Huh huh?
- Hey, Harry?

49:33.888 --> 49:35.470
Yeah, you there, sir.

49:37.558 --> 49:39.174
Get the ball in the basket,

49:39.268 --> 49:41.976
you can win a cute little doll
for the lovely lady back there.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.976
- Maybe you're scared.
- You got some money?

49:45.066 --> 49:48.229
The young man's going to clean
me out of all my profits.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.981
I'm in, but I'll just play.
Not for money.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.189
- Run it.
- How about every one we win

49:54.283 --> 49:55.614
you buy back from us?

49:55.701 --> 49:57.908
All right.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.412
Keep that elbow in, all right?

50:02.500 --> 50:03.865
That's what I'm talking, dawg.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.246
- Bing bing bing.
- Oh ho ho!

50:06.337 --> 50:07.623
That's good form.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.125
That's the difference
right there, man.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.127
Come on, man, get some more,
get some more animals, man...

50:12.218 --> 50:15.256
- Oh, man, look at you.
- Too easy.

50:19.809 --> 50:22.642
- Tosha, take this in the house for Mama.
- Okay.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.719
Hey, wait up.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.814
Hey, man, here's your cut.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.397
Oh no, you keep it.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.984
Thanks.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.415
Think I'm winning him over.

50:46.502 --> 50:48.994
Don't be so sure about that.

50:51.048 --> 50:54.507
He hasn't really had
a real man in his life.

50:54.593 --> 50:57.426
And I sure can't afford
to let another one come running in

50:57.513 --> 50:59.550
and out of it.

51:04.895 --> 51:08.479
Is it his life or your life
we're talking about?

51:08.566 --> 51:10.227
What?

51:10.317 --> 51:12.729
I don't know who
you're protecting, you or him.

51:15.614 --> 51:18.572
Both of us, I guess.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.868
I see.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.287
You really think
he's that good?

51:27.752 --> 51:29.163
I do.

51:29.253 --> 51:32.712
Well, how would that work?
I mean, how would you coach him?

51:32.798 --> 51:35.210
I mean, you're here.
He's with me in Chicago.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.793
And look, he's not
moving down here.

51:37.887 --> 51:39.719
I can make a few trips up there,

51:39.805 --> 51:42.137
give him some drills.

51:42.224 --> 51:44.761
Maybe in the summer,
he can do a camp

51:44.852 --> 51:47.059
with me and some
of the other players.

51:47.146 --> 51:50.980
Hmm, what about
his education?

51:51.066 --> 51:52.602
I promise you

51:52.693 --> 51:56.152
he'll come back
smarter than he left.

51:58.949 --> 52:02.738
Yeah, well, I'll think about it.

52:02.828 --> 52:05.035
- Take your time.
- I have to ask him.

52:05.122 --> 52:08.114
Yeah, do that.

52:10.169 --> 52:12.001
Hey, thank you for the day.

52:12.087 --> 52:14.044
I really appreciate it.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.748
No, thank you.

52:16.842 --> 52:17.957
Goodbye...

52:18.052 --> 52:21.044
and thank you
so much, Harry.

52:22.681 --> 52:24.672
Goodbye.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.762
Oh.

52:39.114 --> 52:41.367
It's for you.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.617
Thanks.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.383
Excuse me.

53:05.724 --> 53:08.056
I'm just gonna go and pack.

53:08.143 --> 53:10.054
No, you are gonna stay

53:10.145 --> 53:12.273
for the reading
of the will, aren't you?

53:12.356 --> 53:15.314
Oh, no no no no.

53:15.401 --> 53:18.143
Stay? Daddy didn't
leave her nothing.

53:18.237 --> 53:20.478
- Vera.
- You should stay.

53:20.573 --> 53:22.484
- No, really.
- Come on.

53:22.575 --> 53:24.407
Come on, sit down.

53:24.493 --> 53:26.825
- Come on over here.
- He your daddy too.

53:26.912 --> 53:29.825
Brenda, come on.

53:29.915 --> 53:31.497
Come on.
Come on in here now.

53:31.584 --> 53:33.450
Come on, you'll probably
thank me too.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.205
You're Daddy's child,
you may as well.

53:35.296 --> 53:36.957
- You never know.
- Why don't you shut--

53:37.047 --> 53:38.458
Sit down now, sit sit.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.835
L.B., she ain't no puppy-

53:39.925 --> 53:41.836
What, you gonna have
her sit and do tricks?

53:41.927 --> 53:44.464
Brother Sam, you read
the last will and "testicles."

53:44.555 --> 53:47.343
Yeah, that's what
I've been waiting for.

53:47.433 --> 53:49.470
I got dressed up
for this. Come on.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.096
Okay, folks...

53:51.186 --> 53:53.928
Pop Brown's last
will and testament.

53:54.023 --> 53:56.105
Here it is.

53:56.191 --> 53:59.855
"To I.B. and his
beautiful wife Sarah..."

53:59.945 --> 54:02.983
Beautiful? Must have been blind,
crippled and crazy.

54:04.950 --> 54:06.987
Leave all my money..."

54:07.077 --> 54:09.569
<i>- Whoa'. Thank you , Daddy.
- Sweet'.!</i>

54:09.663 --> 54:14.373
- "...a total amount of $575."
- You rich! You rich!

54:14.460 --> 54:17.043
- That ain't nothing.
- What? 500?

54:17.129 --> 54:19.871
We-- we took care
of that sucker till he died.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.127
He just leave us
nothing but that?

54:22.217 --> 54:25.050
$575.

54:25.137 --> 54:28.050
I washed his toes
and cleaned his nose!

54:28.140 --> 54:30.723
He's so happy he can't
get his words out. He's rich.

54:30.809 --> 54:32.391
And and and--
keep reading, baby.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.890
- "To Vera..."
- Yes.

54:34.980 --> 54:37.893
Leave all my love."

54:37.983 --> 54:39.360
Love, yes, and...

54:39.443 --> 54:41.650
"May it keep you warm at night."

54:43.280 --> 54:45.191
There's got to be more.
You keep reading, baby.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.239
Keep reading 'cause I know
there's more for me.

54:47.326 --> 54:49.192
"And to Brown..."

54:49.286 --> 54:51.323
Oh, boy, this is good.

54:51.413 --> 54:53.529
Leave my house."

54:53.624 --> 54:55.410
The house?

54:55.501 --> 54:58.914
I'd rather have the love.
That house is tore up, Brown.

54:59.004 --> 55:01.086
Shut up, Vera.
We grew up in that house.

55:01.173 --> 55:04.006
Yeah, us and several families

55:04.093 --> 55:06.755
of rats and roaches.
What the hell is that?

55:06.845 --> 55:09.177
"To my daughter Brenda..."

55:09.264 --> 55:10.925
- Brenda?
- Brenda?

55:11.016 --> 55:14.805
<i>_</i> wh__
- leave my old rental property."

55:14.895 --> 55:18.388
Oh, Brenda,
that's wonderful.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.814
He left me a house?

55:51.932 --> 55:54.765
Do you think we're living here?

55:54.852 --> 55:57.139
Do you think
we're living here now?

55:57.229 --> 56:00.847
Okay, well, it has potential.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.979
Potential to be torn down.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.810
Is this our house, Mama?

56:05.904 --> 56:07.815
Looks that way, baby.

56:07.906 --> 56:10.398
- I'm gonna go back to the projects.
- Yeah, me too.

56:10.492 --> 56:12.074
Me three.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.370
I'd stay with you, brother.

56:21.086 --> 56:23.077
Hmm.

56:31.513 --> 56:33.595
Come on.

56:33.682 --> 56:35.673
At least go inside.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.638
All right, but, Tosha, Lena,

56:38.729 --> 56:41.096
y'all wait in the car.
Come on, go ahead.

56:41.190 --> 56:43.181
Looks dangerous in here.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.319
Ma.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.231
It got a welcome mat.

56:59.041 --> 57:01.032
Ooh.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.997
- It's a nice house.
- Really?

57:08.092 --> 57:10.459
What you looking at?

57:12.429 --> 57:14.340
It just needs a little work.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.889
This house don't need
no little nothing.

57:16.975 --> 57:19.057
- Ma, come on.
- What?

57:19.144 --> 57:21.055
Can we please get out of here?

57:21.146 --> 57:22.728
I'm not trying to miss the bus.

57:22.815 --> 57:26.024
Could you just give me a minute?
Let me ask you something.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.977
What do you think about
Harry coaching you?

57:29.071 --> 57:32.314
- Hmm?
- I'm cool with it if it gets us out of here.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.739
Oh, he cool with it.

57:36.829 --> 57:38.240
That's good.

57:38.330 --> 57:40.913
Uh-huh.

57:40.999 --> 57:44.242
You know, I really wish
you weren't leaving.

57:44.336 --> 57:47.795
Well, gotta get back to my life.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.794
- Ma, come on!
- I'm coming.

57:56.098 --> 57:58.055
Brenda, you leaving
me so soon?

57:58.142 --> 58:00.383
Yeah, we got to be heading back.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.343
Okay, well, look,
here's my number.

58:02.437 --> 58:04.144
I want you to keep in touch, okay?

58:04.231 --> 58:07.098
- Oh, I will.
- All right.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.728
And here...

58:08.819 --> 58:11.186
What's this?

58:11.280 --> 58:14.113
It's from me and Sarah.
We wanted to bless you with something.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.315
No, Cora, no. No, I can't.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.651
- No, take it.
- I can't.

58:18.745 --> 58:21.157
You have to take it.
We wanted to bless you with it.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.285
It's just a little something.
Brenda, please.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.582
Ain't no telling when
I'd be able to pay y'all back.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.626
Oh, honey,
don't worry about that.

58:27.713 --> 58:30.000
If some of these fathers
don't take care of these babies,

58:30.090 --> 58:33.048
then us single mothers have
to stick together. Please take it.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.383
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58:38.473 --> 58:41.465
This is the nicest thing
that anybody's ever done for me.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.551
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.852
Well, maybe you need
to change your friends.

58:48.233 --> 58:51.726
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.621
- What did he say?
- Yeah, he hiring all right,

59:03.707 --> 59:05.618
but not for the job
he advertising for.

59:05.709 --> 59:08.076
- I go kill him now.
- No no no no.

59:08.170 --> 59:10.286
- Cheryl.
- Let me go.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.997
Stop it, calm down.

59:13.091 --> 59:16.880
Hey, don't you wanna
hear about my trip, huh?

59:16.970 --> 59:19.883
- You never told me about the trip.
- Don't ask.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.465
- Brenda, you just--
- I'm just kidding.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.596
Did he leave you
anything at least?

59:24.686 --> 59:27.144
Yeah, a house.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.689
- When are we moving?
- Huh-uh, girl, it's so raggedy.

59:29.775 --> 59:32.483
You can't live in it.
Compared to that, we live in a palace.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.151
Brenda, don't be selfish.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.229
Let's move to Georgia
so I can find me one

59:36.323 --> 59:39.406
of those big old
Jethro-looking papis

59:39.493 --> 59:42.485
so I can cucuchanga.

59:42.579 --> 59:45.492
Girl, you know what?
I think I might have met somebody

59:45.582 --> 59:47.493
- who'd be just your style.
- For me?

59:47.584 --> 59:48.790
Uh-huh.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.868
His name's Brown.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.540
I got it.

59:56.635 --> 59:59.468
Who is it?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.545
Hey.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.472
Hey.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.180
What you doing here?

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.182
I've been thinking
about what you said,

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.389
and I'm gonna help you out.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:14.566
So can I come in,

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:16.644
Please?

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.567
Yeah.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.652
Come on in.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.834
Damn, girl, this how you live?

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.546
You gonna give me
some money or not?

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.348
What you gonna give me, huh?

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:49.427
I ain't gonna
give you nothing.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:53.014
- Aw, come on, girl, damn it.
- No, stop it, stop it.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:55.645
You oughta wanna do the right thing
and take care of your son.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:57.443
- You're right.
- Why I gotta threaten you

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.270
with child support
to take care of him?

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:00.946
Damn, Brenda, do it.

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:04.571
- The boy probably ain't mine anyway.
- You bastard!

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.163
You need this money,
don't you, right?

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.862
So come on, baby,
where's the bedroom?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.789
No, stop it. I don't sleep
with men for money.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.119
Well, your mama used to,
didn't she?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.204
I ain't my mama. Get the hell
out of my house!

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:23.461
Forget you then.
You all ain't getting nothing.

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:25.842
I don't care if both of y'all
starve to death.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.220
You bastard. You would
do that to your own son?

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:31.268
- Hey.
- You're just evil.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.814
I told you when you was pregnant I
didn't give a damn about you or the boy.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.313
Matter of fact, what did you do with
the $200 I gave you for the abortion?

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.485
I'll bet you wish
you had that $200 now.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:43.064
- Don't you?
- Hey, Michael, baby.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.026
Hey, Mike. What's up, boy?

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:51.989
Mama, why you begging like this?

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:54.291
No no, he ain't gotta help us.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.460
No, I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.332
You don't need
to beg this motherf--

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.630
Leaveit
He's still your father.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.675
- Get your hand out of my face.
- Boy, better watch your mouth!

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.675
- No, no, it's not worth it.
- Mama, are you defending him?

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.302
Look, if you ain't
man enough to help us,

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:12.431
I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.979
- No, baby. Where are you going?
- No no.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.022
Michael! Mike, stop him.

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:19.726
That boy ain't my responsibility.
It isn't my problem.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:26.065
No, Michael!

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.070
Michael!

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:55.849
Michael.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.725
. Hey-

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.604
Can I come in?

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.810
Yeah yeah, come on in.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:12.153
Have a seat.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.283
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Michael.

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:20.244
He's not here?

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.840
No.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.961
Did you tell him about the practice
sessions I set up for him?

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:27.179
Yeah, I did.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:29.299
I'm sorry.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.178
What's going on?

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.190
What's up, man?

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:48.773
What's up? You're just
the man I need to see.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.278
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.360
You can't win a game
with your shoes falling off, dawg.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:56.197
- Here.
- These are for me?

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.532
You know it. I got money
on this game, dawg.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.334
I need you on your

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:05.381
- Thanks, Calvin.
- It's all good, dawg.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.879
Hey, man,

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:09.471

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.761
Yeah.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.761
You working?

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.137
Yeah.

01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:18.310
You want in?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.891
Yeah, show me
what I gotta do.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:27.228
- All right.
- Mike.

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:30.280
Who is this fool?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.859
- He 5-0?
- No, man, I'll handle it.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.951
Dude, what are you doing here?

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.453
Your mother's looking for you.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.751
You got some nerve
coming around here.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.124
- So you gonna do this, huh?
- Why not?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:48.458
- You're too smart for this.
- Dude, you don't know nothing about me.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:51.670
I know you're about
to make a stupid mistake.

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:53.845
Harry, you don't know
nothing about my life.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:56.173
You don't know
what we're up against.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:58.350
It doesn't matter
what you're up against.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.929
You could make a stupid mistake and have
everything in the world going for you.

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.560
I was in the league.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.190
I started gambling.

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:12.899
Lost everything,
including my wife and kids.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:18.617
I made mistakes
I'm still paying for today.

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:20.869
I know a few things about
going down the wrong road.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:24.293
And this is the wrong road.

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:27.538
- All right, man.
- Dude,

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.339
you better get out of here.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.384
Okay.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.552
We're supposed to practice
tomorrow at 3:00.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:39.012
If you show up,

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.685
then I'll know you're as smart
as I think you are.

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.564
Yeah, whatever, man.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.561
I'm gonna be here for two days.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:54.816
- All right?
- Yeah, let's do this.

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:11.248
Come here.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.601
What?

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:26.271
Where you been all night, huh?

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:29.567
I was with Calvin.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.940
Okay, so you're a man now.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.941
You gonna sell dope, huh?

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.773
Now you think
that makes you a man?

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.404
Why not, Mama?
We ain't got nothing.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.827
- Boy, are you crazy?
- No, you work like a dog,

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.279
and what has it gotten you?

01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:44.285
You talk about God
making a way.

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.367
Mama, I'm not trying
to die to get to heaven.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.951
I want mine here on earth.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:49.957
Then you know what?

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:52.415
You gonna have to get out
of my house then, huh?

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.092
You think you're grown? Go.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.543
Get out!

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.549
Mama, where am I gonna go?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.177
I don't wanna hear it.
I done my best by you.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.804
I done tried. Get out.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:06.102
Who's gonna help you
with Lena and Tosha?

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.305
Don't you even worry
about that, okay? I got that.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.232
You just get out.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.696
- No no, I'm not going, Mama.
- Go on.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.692
No child of mine is gonna
sell dope, you hear me?

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:19.491
I ain't sitting up in here waiting
to hear that you done got killed.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:21.409
Get out. Hit the bricks.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.078
No, Mama, I'm not going.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.747
No, if I go, I'm a coward
just like my dad.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.324
I'm your son.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.002
I'm not gonna leave you
like them other dudes.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.999
Mama, I'm just tired

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.172
of seeing you hurt
and struggling.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.795
I'm sorry.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.673
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:43.841
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.517
You hear me?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.641
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:52.475
We gonna be all right.
I promise. I promise.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.778
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.356
I love you, baby.
I love you.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.533
- I love you too. I'm sorry.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.747
Okay, just--

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.037
just-- just go to bed, all right?

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:09.412
Go now.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.179
All right, let's go.
On the whistle, chest passes.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.885
Passer makes the shooter.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:31.392
Pass it like you want him
to shoot the ball.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.100
Are you coachable?
Do you listen?

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.069
It's good to see you.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:44.158
On the whistle,
chest passes.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.752
- What's up, Calvin?
- What's up, dawg?

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:00.880
I won six large
on you tonight.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.051
You play with heart, son.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.349
Here.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.685
Look, man, that's what
I came to tell you.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.140
Calvin, I can't do this.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:19.562
Here, this is all the money.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.398
It's your cut and mine.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.234
I'm sorry, dude.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.616
You know what?
I understand that.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.447
You ain't got this
in you, man.

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:34.035
You go on now.
You go play basketball.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:37.120
Me? I'm gonna be
a hood rat.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.705
That's all I'll ever be.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.791
Calvin, you can be
whatever you want to be.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:44.127
No, kid.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:50.845
Yo, son, you think
you can just sell on my turf?

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:54.350
Mike, run!

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:10.203
Mike's great. I wish he
was playing in my gym.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.282
What about you?
What about your house?

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.787
What about it?

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.415
What you gonna do with it?

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:20.293
Let it do what it's been doing
for the last whatever years.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.124
Which is what?

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.505
Sit there.

01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:28.134
- That ain't no good.
- Try this. You'll like it.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.261
Get in there. Come on.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.935
Oh, man, that's good.
What is that?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:36.184
- Is that pork?
- That's pork, baby.

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:39.016
I don't even eat pork,
and that's good.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.036
Brenda, I like talking to you.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.871
Thanks.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:04.208
But this is about
helping my son, right?

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:05.838
Yeah.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.887
What if I also enjoy spending
as much time with you

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.089
- as I do coaching your son?
- Harry.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.764
I ain't going down
that road, okay?

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.897
- Thanks, girl.
- You're welcome.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:21.816
- All right now, I work for tips.
- I know.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:24.190
- This is your neighborhood, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.736
It ain't so bad, is it?

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:29.157
You'd rather live here
than in your own house?

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:32.372
Well, I know this. I don't know
nothing about Georgia.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.321
Soifsffiends
keeping you here.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:38.204
If I could live here,
I ain't afraid of nothing.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.411
Brenda, ay, mami.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:44.089
- Cheryl, hi, girl.
- I've been looking all over for you.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.757
We have to go to the hospital.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.335
- The hospital, why?
- They shot him.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.807
- What happened, Cheryl?
- Mikey-- they shot him!

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.551
Michael.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.437
I never had much of a mother,

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:07.271
so I was determined
to be the best that I could.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.982
When he was young,
I gave him to the Lord.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.443
I said, "Lord, protect my baby.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:14.448
Watch him for me."

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.450
But I can't--

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.452
I can't feed him.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:20.534
I can't give him what he need.

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.458
There are nights
when I go to bed hungry

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:28.042
'cause I know they didn't
get enough to eat all day.

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:34.222
You know, I just...

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.470
feel so bad.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.142
Why did I do this to them?

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:45.942
You know, I can't even
keep 'em out of harm's way.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.895
Hey hey hey hey.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.071
You've done more than most.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.073
Look, thank you.
I know you have to go.

01:12:56.164 --> 01:12:57.620
No, I'm not going anywhere

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.199
unless you want me to go.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.330
No.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.003
I'm here with you.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:09.340
Thank you.

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:17.257
Hey, Brenda, what's up with all these
emergency phone calls?

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:19.308
Michael Jr.,
he was shot last night

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.306
trying to hustle money for me.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.434
But I ain't paying for no funeral.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.186
He ain't dead. You bastard.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.359
Hold on here. Don't call me.

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:30.687
- You know what happened last night.
- Hey hey!

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.819
- Is everything all right here, Brenda?
- Yeah.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.697
I'm fine.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:41.490
I gotta go to work.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:44.292
Hey hey-

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:45.880
- Michael.
- What?

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.711
This is my last $25.

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:53.715
That's what you make?
Can I buy an hour of your time

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:55.387
to spend with your son?

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.053
Don't you call my house again.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:03.262
You're pissing off my wife.

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:12.320
- You okay?
- Miss Brown.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:14.693
- Yes.
- Hi. Now we managed

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.900
to get the bullet
and stop the bleeding.

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.156
It's a miracle that
it missed his vital organs.

01:14:19.247 --> 01:14:20.988
Is he gonna be okay?

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:22.993
Yes, he's gonna be fine.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.415
I need to see him.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.038
Well, he's in recovery right now,

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.587
but he'll be in l.C.U.
in just a little bit.

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.835
Thank you, thank you.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:33.792

I know, but you're

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.829
I don't think so.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.207
I'll come visit
or something, but no.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.959

he stayed as long as he did.

Ay, you know I don't like half
the men you've dated,

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.924
but this one--

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.474
I like him a lot.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.393
Mmm.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.096
Uh, we ain't dating.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.727
Yeah, call it whatever you want.
You might not be dating him,

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.106
- but he's definitely dating you.
- Huh-uh.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:58.732

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.166
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

Oh my God.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.587
Welcome home.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.581
What is this? Harry!

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.212
I can't believe this.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:03.714
It's your house.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.795
Oh my God.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:08.973
Hey! Don't y'all just
stand there.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.266
Come on in this house!

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.765
Come on now!
Come on!

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.641
Oh, Harry told us
what happened.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.814
- We all prayed for you, Mike.
- Thank you.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:19.313
Y'all come on in.
I decorated.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.394
- What?
- No he didn't.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.781
Baby. Awww.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.369
Come here.
Come on.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.244
Oh my gosh.

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:41.835
Mom!

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.587
Mama, I got my own room!

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.543
I know, baby.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:49.555
Oh! Oh, God,
thank you.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:53.601
Thank you. How did you
afford to do all of this?

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:56.930
Well, I pitched in
most of the money.

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:59.516
If you call $45 most of it,

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.851
well then, okay.

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.196
No, we had a fundraiser
at the church.

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:07.535
- Yeah, and we all pitched in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:10.952
L-- I don't know what to say.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:12.870
Money shot.

01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:15.699
Here you go. Go up strong.
Always go up strong.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:24.711
You know, I think
that Harry's a nice man.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.463
- Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:30.013
- Thank you.
- He put up the most money for this house.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.885
- He sure did.
- He did?

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.558
And I think he likes you.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:36.227
Mm-hmm.

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:37.895
- Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:39.598
Where do these
two lovebirds go?

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.649
Come on, I'll show you.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:48.023
I think...

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:50.154
he likes her son.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:51.734
What are you talking about?

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.285
Honey, are you that naive?

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.739
You haven't noticed all that attention
he been giving that boy?

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.540
What are you trying to say, Vera?

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.879
Oh, not like that.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:03.330
He's being so nice to her
because her son

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:04.835
is a gold mine.

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.791
Okay? He's trying to get in

01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:09.674
so he can get that boy to go pro
so he can get some of them perks...

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.590
maybe pay off some of them
gambling debts, okay?

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:17.894
Child, please.
This is an investment.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.687
She better watch out.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.935
- I don't believe none of that.
- Me neither.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.142
Why else would
a man be this nice

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.977
to a woman with three--

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.563
count 'em-- three kids.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.445
Well, you know, Vera, there are
some good men in this world.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.617
And Harry happens
to be one of them.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.787
- That's right.
- Not according to the local bookies.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.081
Why you think he got
kicked out of the league?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.206
Don't sit there acting like y'all don't
know this boy got a gambling problem.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:44.879
- Don't be acting like you don't know.
- You need to stop

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.127
- listening to all that gossip, Vera.
- Please.

01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:50.677
- Stop being messy.
- Hush your mouth before she hears you.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.004
- Yes.
- If you ain't happy,

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.260
you don't want nobody else to be.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.809
Well, I called it like
I see it and smell it!

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.637
Well, you're always
smelling up some mess.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:02.313
That's right.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.652
Do your negative
smelling somewhere else

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:06.646
'cause you're always
smelling up a mess.

01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:12.698
- Cora!
- What?

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:14.492
- Cora!
- Yeah!

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:17.320
I'm in the kitchen!
I'm in the kitchen!

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:20.657
Your mama done went crazy!
People just everywhere!

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.209
Mr. Brown, please!

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.787
Cora, you slapped your daddy?
I oughta whup your butt.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.383
Calm down. What's wrong?

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:28.877
Just sit down. Sit down.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:30.299
- Turn the TV on.
- Okay--

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.127
- Turn the TV on!
- What happened on the TV?

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.178
- Get the TV on.
- I'm trying to get it on. Hold on.

01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:36.176
- What happened?
- Look!

01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:39.976
A routine traffic stop turned
into one of the largest and most bizarre

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.144
and shocking police pursuits

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.347
that we have ever seen.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:47.274
This old woman is driving
like she has a lot to lose.

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:49.318
Who could this be calling
me right now? Hello.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:52.193
Cora, hey.
How you doing, baby?

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:53.990
Madea, please tell me
that's not you.

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.487
Yeah, it's me, honey.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:56.784
Yeah.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.486
Madea, why don't you
just pull over?

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.117
- You can't out--
- I can't pull over.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.164
- You goin' to jail.
- These police is after me.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.662
Hold on, I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.459
Mabel, pull over. Just stop.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.083
Oh, Lordy, there's helicopters
and everything now.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.256
- Pull your car over--
- Mabel, you can't outrun

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.334
- the "helichoppers."
- Please, Madea, please!

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:16.171
- They ain't taking me to jail!
- Like hell they ain't.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.381
...just gonna send me to jail.
I'm going all the way this time.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.341
I'm going all the way this time.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.222
Madea, please
pull the car over.

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:24.554
They ain't gonna get me!
They ain't gonna get me!

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:26.355
I'm gonna be on "Cops."

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:27.898
No, you can't. Madea, please.

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:29.851
I love you, honey.
Please just pull over.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.527
I can't pull over, Cora.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:34.072
Y'all come down there to DeKalb County,
put $20 on my book.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:36.240
I'm running out of gas.
I might have to stop.

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:39.319
If it's any "constipation,"
I love you.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:41.700
I always have
and I always will.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.747
Madea, please.
I love you, honey, please--

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.745
Yeah, I love you too.
Go to hell.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.504
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, sweetheart.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.291
- Guess what.
- What?

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.672
Harry took me to his lawyer
to sign a contract with him.

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:58.095
- He's my manager now.
- He did what?

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.219
Yeah, I sent some
footage to a pro scout.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.175
I don't know
how the word got out,

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:05.682
but next thing I know, there's bunch
of agents at the gym pressuring Mike.

01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:09.061
You know, I had him sign something--
so they wouldn't take advantage of him.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:12.610
- Harry knows his stuff, Mama.
- I know a little bit.

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:14.937
Michael, why don't you
go check on your sisters,

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:18.241
- make sure they wash up?
- Okay.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:22.494
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.952
You been awful quiet
the last few days.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.829
I'm fine.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.752
Harry, can I
ask you something?

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.704
Yeah.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.549
What's in this for you?

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:38.594
- What are you talking about?
- Why is he so important to you?

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.139
- Hmm?

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.512
- Hmm.
- Mike's a good kid.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.513
He's a talented kid.

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.813
What are you
talking about?

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:53.143
I don't like you spending
all this time with him.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:56.730
And I don't understand why you're
sending footage to pro scouts.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.323
Trying to-- trying to help.

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.026
Why? Why? What for?

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.610
What's in it for you?

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:04.912
I mean, if he gets
a million-dollar contract,

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.659
you think you
gonna get your cut?

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.161
Is this some
kinda game to you?

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:09.834
Whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.958
Where is this coming from?

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:16.006
Huh? What, have that many men hurt
you that you can't trust one?

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:18.050
This ain't about me, all right?

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.174
This is about you.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:22.255
Now, how much gambling
debt are you in?

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.556
You didn't think
I'd hear about that?

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:35.188
- You think I'm in it for some money?
- Well, are you?

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:36.690
Is that what you think of me?

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.522
Should that be
what I think of you?

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:43.450
- Brenda--
- You're not going to be his manager.

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.372
- Brenda--
- No, just go. Go. Go, please.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:52.999
I paid all of my gambling debts.
I don't owe anybody anything.

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:56.463
Get out.

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:14.223
Oh, hell. I'm running out of gas.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.184
Pull your car over to the side.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:18.645
Cora, here.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.736
Go bail your mama out.
Give her this $20.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:24.487
What-- what is this for?

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.239
It's for back child support.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.991
Back--

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.118
I owe it to ya.

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.745
And there it is.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:34.167
- As fast as it started--
- Oh, they got her.

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:35.665
But it still has gone down

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:38.669
as one of the longest
police pursuits in history.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:41.296
What the hell? They gonna
send "helichoppers"

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.343
and all these police cars
for a little old woman.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.263
- Get out of the vehicle now.
- Don't shoot.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.843
I'm getting out of the car.
They gonna lock your ass up.

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:54.271
I ain't got no weapon.

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.019
I ain't never do nothing wrong.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.362
- You gonna leave me up here--
- I ain't got no weapon.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:00.561
All of this for me, huh?

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:04.194
What the hell you
got me surrounded for?

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.117
She got a gun!
She-- she kidnapped me.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:10.492
Get out of your
vehicle with your hands up.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.713
Very slowly!
Very slowly!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.467
Put your hands
on the car, ma'am.

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:26.262
- Hands on the car right now--
- Hold on one minute.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:28.589
- Let me tell you something here.
- Put your hands on the car.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.472
I ain't finna put my hands on the car
'cause my hands is hurtin'.

01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:33.303
- Ma'am, put your hands--
- Who the hell you talkin' to?

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:35.138
- You don't want--
- Put your hands on the car!

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:36.973
- You ain't gonna take me down!
- Settle down, ma'am!

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.478
Put your hands on the car now.

01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:40.480
I'm Madea!

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:42.528
There's another charge.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.776
And another charge.

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:48.076
- Man down! Man down!
- Another charge. That's six more years.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.243
Get her off me!

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.911
One, two, three!

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.661
You giving me a mammogram!

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.257
Hell, you ain't going--

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:03.833
Get in the car, ma'am.
Get in the car.

01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:06.760
Get in the car.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:09.839
- Transport chase suspect. Over.
- Affirmative.

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:15.974
- Stay back, people.
- All right, everybody.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.622
Just a minute.

01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:49.049
- Hi. How may I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Richard Carney.

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:51.801
I'm looking for Brenda
and Michael Brown.

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:55.351
- What about?
- I'm a sports agent and, well, can we talk?

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.724
Uh, what about?
How'd you get my address?

01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.851
Ma, Ma, please.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:04.602
Come on in.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.570
Hi.

01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:09.194
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:12.909
I sent your son's tape
to two professional teams.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.746
And they were very impressed.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:17.243
I've already got two teams

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.746
that are interested
in signing him right now.

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:21.418
- Really?
- Yes.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:23.371
And I can make a really
good deal for your son.

01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:27.250
So what do you want to do?

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:28.960
Hmm?

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.590
What do you think?

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:35.512
So what about college?

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.184
We'll have you take
college courses,

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:39.398
- even help you get a degree.
- Mama...

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.565
Let's do it.

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.488
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah?

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:52.282
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.235
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.822
Um, he signed a contract
with someone to be his manager.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:00.829
Does that person have any legal grounds
to any of his money?

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.660
- You mean Harry Belton?
- Yeah.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:05.872
That contract didn't ask for money.
It was more of a guidance thing.

01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.456
He wasn't even trying to get paid.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:09.713
I guess with all of his
knowledge of this business,

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.885
he just didn't want him
to be taken advantage of.

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:17.641
Listen, Miss Brown,

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:19.344
I'll be in touch in a week, okay?

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:21.270
And you, young man,

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.064
- you get ready.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:24.151 --> 01:29:28.110
We'd like to say that the Thunderhawks
are very happy to have him on board.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:31.154
A million dollars is a lot of money...

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:34.154
- I'm his daddy.
- ...are other players going to be jealous--

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:36.155
Hey, son, how you doing?

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:38.032
Look, son, can I holler
at you a minute?

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:41.991
- Mama.
- He's still your daddy.

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:44.702
- What is he to me?
- I just want to say congratulations, boy.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:47.003
- I'm proud of you. You did it.
- Hey hey hey.

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:50.208
When you had the chance to be in my life,
you didn't want no part of me.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.464
You should have thought
about all this before.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.670
Hey, now, come on.
Don't be like that.

01:29:54.765 --> 01:29:57.803
I don't know why you here, man.
That $25 an hour is waiting on you.

01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.509
What position is he
going to play?

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:03.096
Coach, what do you think Mike's
gonna do with all the money?

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.397
Why don't we let Mike
answer that question?

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.772
Mike, what are you gonna
do with all that money?

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.025
Make sure my mom and my sisters

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.652
are taken care of.

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:18.281
- And he's gonna finish school.
- And finish school.

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.408
Hey, Mike, what are you
gonna do for your dad?

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:22.957
- Who?
- Isn't that your father?

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.533
Well, that's funny.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:26.960
I've-- I've seen my father
twice since I was four.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.046
My mom's been breaking her back

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:32.591
to make sure my sisters and I

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.338
had food on the table.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.966
We lived in the projects
while he went on

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:40.220
and started his life with someone else
living the good life,

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:43.894
but somehow he seemed
to make it to my big day.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:47.439
Why don't I let my dad answer that
for you? Come on, Dad.

01:30:47.526 --> 01:30:49.267
Are you proud of your son?

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:51.102
What was he like as a kid?

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:53.107
How were his grades
growing up?

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:55.860
- Tell us about the moves he got from you.
- Favorite game memory?

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.908
Well, I-- you know,
that was a long time ago.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:31:01.203
He's always been a good boy.
He's always been real athletic

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.077
and-- and he's always
loved his basketball.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:05.999
How do you feel
about your son's comments?

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.829
Hey, you-- you know, it--

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:13.124
you know what?

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:15.004
Are you gonna spend
more time with him now?

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.086
That's up to my boy.
That's up to Mike.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.467
- I hope so.
- With you showing up at this time,

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:22.266
some folks would consider
that gold digging.

01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:24.639
But hey, this is
all about my son, right?

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:26.311
This is all about
my boy, all right?

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.685
This is not about me.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.406
This isn't the way home.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.079
Yeah, I know.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:46.824
What?

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:49.956
Ma, you were wrong about Harry.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.663
Michael, you don't know
nothing about that, okay?

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:55.590
No, that's a good dude, Mama.

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.634
And you need to fix it.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.884
Well, isn't that
what you would tell me?

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:05.384
Yeah.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.724
He's in there.

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:43.718
Hey.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:50.683
Hey.

01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:55.730
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.276
Talent, attitude, skill.

01:32:57.364 --> 01:32:59.696
He deserves it.

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:01.774
Thank you
for all your help.

01:33:04.663 --> 01:33:06.245
It's all good.

01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:11.704
You know, um...

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:13.536
I can pay you back now

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.247
for all you did for us--

01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:18.298
the house, the move,

01:33:18.385 --> 01:33:20.126
everything.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:23.463
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:25.763
I didn't do all of that
so you could pay me back.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.466
I'm sorry.

01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:31.515
I'm just so used to being
taken advantage of--

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:34.143
Yeah, that you don't even know
when somebody loves you.

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:37.401
You love me?

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:40.729
Yeah.

01:33:42.826 --> 01:33:44.863
Tell Mike I said congratulations.

01:33:56.006 --> 01:33:59.624
Hey, what if I told you
I love you too,

01:33:59.718 --> 01:34:02.085
but I just got scared for a second,

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:05.887
but I'd rather be scared and with you

01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:09.763
than not scared and not have you?

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.770
What-- why would I scare you?

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.358
Because you're everything
I always wanted in a man.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:26.362
Then let me be that for you.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:16.617
Cora, do you miss
your granddaddy?

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:19.710
I never met him.

01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:22.085
- You what?
- I never met him.

01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:24.257
Let me introduce you
to your granddaddy.

01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:29.387
- He dead.
- Cora, that man died, but he can still hear.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:32.341
Whoo! Don't you know
that angels got ears, Cora?

01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:33.937
Come here, Cora.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.978
You got to meet him.
Look the way he dressed.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.476
Look at Daddy.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:41.149
Cora, our daddy was ugly,
but he was our daddy.

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:43.947
Yes, he was. Cora, look at him.

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:45.441
This is your granddaddy.

01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:47.773
- Don't touch it.
- That's our granddaddy.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:49.278
It's our granddaddy.

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:51.201
- Cora-- look at him, Cora.
- I'm looking at him.

01:35:51.287 --> 01:35:53.699
Look at him!
Look down at him!

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.872
Look at him!

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.199
Look down at him!

01:35:57.293 --> 01:36:00.206
Go up close, Cora.
Cora, look-- look-- kiss him.

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.378
Kiss your granddaddy.
Kiss him on the forehead.

01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:03.671
Huh-uh,
huh-uh, huh-uh!

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.465
Let her alone!

01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:07.384
How strong is your faith?

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:09.211
You believe he can come back?

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:11.467
You believe he can
be like Nazareth?

01:36:11.558 --> 01:36:13.674
Put your hand
on his heart, Cora.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.179
You can beat some life in--

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.477
beat his heart, Cora!
Beat into him, Cora!

01:36:17.564 --> 01:36:19.555
Don't touch my daddy!

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.640
Cora, I just wanted
you to have--

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:23.566
this is your daddy, Cora.

01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:25.940
Cora, look at him.

Hey!

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:15.072
Yeah, I'm gonna pray now.
Thank you.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:17.279
Y'all bow your heads.

01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:19.080
Bow your heads, I'm praying.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:20.953
Heavenly Father,

01:37:21.044 --> 01:37:24.002
I ask that You would
put them chickens back in that coop

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:25.704
so she can get eggs...

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.789
...to make her pies
and cakes for the church.

01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:30.467
- I need you to watch the road.
- We thank You-- help, Cora, turn.

01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:32.464
We thank you, Lord,
that You have made a way

01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:34.216
for her to make cakes for the church.

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:35.968
Bless them chickens!

01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:37.470
- Yes.
- Amen. Amen.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.641
Amen.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:40.639
I promise you I didn't know.

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.971
Anybody feel bereaved?

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:45.979
Why so many people from
the Bereaved family die?

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:48.811
- I'm bereaved now.
- I don't know why so many--

01:37:48.905 --> 01:37:51.146
peoples are always dying
in the Bereaved family.

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:54.825
Every time you read the paper,
it say the Bereaved family.

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.743
They gonna run out
of peoples in a minute

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.331
if they keep on dying.

01:37:58.414 --> 01:38:00.325
'Cause I looked in--
is she Bereaved?

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:02.623
I didn't even know she was kin
of the Bereaved family.

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:05.168
Whoo. Cora, don't go
gospel gangster on them, baby.

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:07.087
It ain't worth it.
It ain't worth it.

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:09.505
- Don't tell me to calm--
- Cora, just relax.

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.208
- Don't do it, Cora.
- No“

01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:12.963
- Don't do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:14.510
Cora, just sit down.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:17.339
Ooh, you gonna be in that
jail and you gonna rot.

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:19.424
You gonna rot if

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:21.635
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:41.120

01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:47.248
