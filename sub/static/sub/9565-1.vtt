02:35.600 --> 02:37.840
Pretty good fella,
but not good enough.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.039
- Homo!
- Yeah, because I rule, basically...

02:40.201 --> 02:43.000
Shit bender.
Ah, Kelly, you're stankin'!

02:43.241 --> 02:45.480
What about you, you sweaty fuck!

02:45.600 --> 02:48.040
Aargh! Get away, you scummer.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.480
Later then!

02:54.639 --> 02:56.589
What you think of that, then?

02:58.919 --> 02:59.879
Tone?

03:04.710 --> 03:05.710
What?

03:06.799 --> 03:08.719
Think of what?

03:08.960 --> 03:12.079
The moves...
Me, Jonno and Kel worked it out.

03:16.799 --> 03:18.239
It's OK.

03:39.959 --> 03:42.509
Hey! Nothing to worry
about, dude. Yeah?

03:43.238 --> 03:44.718
Yeah.

03:50.917 --> 03:51.917
It's all right.

03:54.838 --> 03:57.038
Everything's cool.

04:09.837 --> 04:11.157
Hi, Maxxie. Hey.

04:11.571 --> 04:12.597
Hi.

04:13.397 --> 04:14.477
Who's that?

04:14.678 --> 04:15.917
That's Tony.

04:19.771 --> 04:20.997
What's up with you?

04:22.597 --> 04:24.717
I had a traumatic subdural haematoma

04:24.837 --> 04:27.277
with motor and
perceptional complications.

04:27.664 --> 04:29.015
Are you mental?

04:29.489 --> 04:30.517
Yes.

04:31.918 --> 04:33.476
I'd still give you one.

04:33.596 --> 04:35.796
Totally. He's well fit.
Yeah, Queenie?

04:35.957 --> 04:37.716
Yeah. He's buff.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.716
Hey come on, Tone.
See you later, girls.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.596
See you Maxxie! Bye!

04:45.996 --> 04:47.836
I wanna give Maxxie one.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.116
You can't. He's homosexual.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.556
Bummer.

04:54.596 --> 04:57.476
See? I remembered your favourite.

04:57.596 --> 04:59.036
Thanks.

05:00.956 --> 05:02.636
You've grown, Tony.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.356
And there's another two
inches in you, easy.

05:07.595 --> 05:09.515
How's your Mum?

05:09.635 --> 05:12.355
I don't remember you.

05:12.475 --> 05:14.595
Oh, well.
We used to have lovely chats

05:14.715 --> 05:16.674
when I was cleaning your mum's place.

05:16.836 --> 05:19.115
You were such a clever little lad.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.795
I'm stupid now.

05:20.996 --> 05:21.996
No.

05:22.475 --> 05:23.635
Here you go, mate.

05:27.874 --> 05:28.874
Thanks, Mum.

05:29.915 --> 05:32.235
Oh, we used to giggle.

05:32.355 --> 05:35.613
Well, you never did know what
your mum was going to say next.

05:36.596 --> 05:38.475
Ketchup, Mum?

05:38.595 --> 05:39.795
Yeah, right.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.674
Bloody hilarious jokes she told.

05:43.835 --> 05:44.982
Filthy.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.518
Oh, a right laugh, your mum.

05:55.108 --> 05:56.108
Mum?

05:58.594 --> 06:00.114
I need to pee.

06:04.514 --> 06:06.794
I can manage it myself usually.

06:06.914 --> 06:08.394
Yeah, sorry.

06:13.234 --> 06:15.833
Oh, fucking... fucking...
fucking thing!

06:34.513 --> 06:35.913
Oh! Ooh.

06:36.873 --> 06:37.833
Oooh!

06:38.233 --> 06:40.113
Ooh la la!

07:15.052 --> 07:16.531
Yee-ha!

07:25.291 --> 07:29.011
Oi, look out.
Here comes Batty Boy.

07:30.131 --> 07:32.611
You wanna watch it, Dale.
He'll slip you a big fat cock!

07:32.731 --> 07:34.651
No fucking way, man!

07:34.771 --> 07:37.211
Cockety-cock-cock!

07:37.331 --> 07:40.091
Or he'll slurp you a big fat cock!

07:41.211 --> 07:44.531
A big fucking cock, yeah.
He'll be like, "All right, my lover!"

07:44.651 --> 07:48.511
and wank you silly all over his face
and then tie you up and shoving

07:48.671 --> 07:50.810
his big fat cock
right up your arse

07:50.930 --> 07:54.330
and you wouldn't be able to fucking
stop him cos it's fucking torture.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.290
You're shrieking and...

08:02.850 --> 08:05.330
I'm just saying fucking homos,
though, innit?

08:05.450 --> 08:06.690
Yeah, fucking homos.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.490
Fuck 'em. We'll fuck them up.

08:08.610 --> 08:11.010
- Fuckin' queers!
- Lads...

08:11.130 --> 08:12.549
Yeah, fuckin' 'omos!

08:13.770 --> 08:14.770
Nice one, Taz!

08:14.890 --> 08:17.130
Hey, Taz!

08:17.250 --> 08:18.370
All right, love?

08:18.490 --> 08:19.540
Tea's ready.

08:23.089 --> 08:24.409
Nice routine, Dad.

08:24.529 --> 08:28.229
Nice? It's gonna fucking
slay them at the regionals.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.133
Cool.

08:30.689 --> 08:33.889
I just wanted to ask, is it OK if
I drop out of my A-levels and...?

08:34.009 --> 08:35.129
Come back?

08:37.328 --> 08:41.129
I wanna leave college and
audition for musicals in London.

08:46.252 --> 08:49.729
You're getting qualifications and
you're coming to me on the building.

08:49.849 --> 08:52.929
But how's a history A-level
gonna help me be a builder?

08:53.049 --> 08:54.849
You'll be an educated builder.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.528
Dad, I want to be a dancer.

08:57.648 --> 09:00.728
They have dancing every Thursday
down the centre. You love that.

09:00.848 --> 09:02.527
- No, but...
- Pastimes.

09:02.786 --> 09:04.058
That's what we're into.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.068
- Dad...
- The rest isn't for us.

09:06.658 --> 09:07.888
Get the dog.

09:08.625 --> 09:09.625
Taz.

09:23.768 --> 09:25.328
Fucking turd burglar.

09:26.448 --> 09:27.867
Watch out, Dale.

09:28.028 --> 09:29.028
Fucking dog!

09:29.188 --> 09:30.231
Quiet, boy.

09:30.889 --> 09:32.463
You got something to say, kidder?

09:32.583 --> 09:35.199
Say what I like.
Free country, innit?

09:35.319 --> 09:38.791
Fair point.
But here's my suggestion, son.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.627
You tell your Dad what
you said to Walter Oliver.

09:44.173 --> 09:45.387
All right, my lover?

09:50.550 --> 09:51.854
Lads...

09:58.727 --> 10:01.907
- You got fucked up, man!
- Big, big time.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
Sid?

10:24.193 --> 10:25.606
Tony?

10:26.186 --> 10:27.761
I need to pee.

10:29.246 --> 10:31.286
My hands don't work.

10:31.919 --> 10:34.746
Well, I always sorted you
out when you were a baby.

10:36.729 --> 10:40.405
I got to register for college,
sign my name on a form.

10:41.837 --> 10:43.865
But my head's forgotten bits of me.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.205
All sorts of bits...

10:47.182 --> 10:49.805
Give it time, love.

10:49.925 --> 10:51.885
Just...

10:52.005 --> 10:53.498
I can aim.

10:53.618 --> 10:55.114
Right...

11:01.385 --> 11:03.025
All right?

11:27.524 --> 11:30.044
Oh, bloody hell, Tone!

11:30.164 --> 11:32.103
You always did make me laugh.

11:33.604 --> 11:35.364
You're making me miss.

11:35.704 --> 11:38.744
You and every other bloke
in this sodding house.

11:47.843 --> 11:50.323
Whatever happened
to that nice lass you had?

11:54.863 --> 11:56.231
My God! OK, watch this!

11:56.351 --> 11:58.563
Watch this
you bunch of pussy-fuckers, OK?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.720
- One, two, three.
- Go!

12:02.443 --> 12:03.803
Oh, my God!

12:13.209 --> 12:15.781
- We on the right floor?
- Dunno, do I?

12:16.041 --> 12:18.003
All right... angry boots.

12:18.122 --> 12:19.722
I want to get ready
for the party.

12:19.842 --> 12:22.122
Well, that'll take all of
about 30 seconds.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.962
I get ready. I dress up.

12:24.082 --> 12:27.482
Nah... that's what we love
about you, Jal... Unstudied.

12:27.602 --> 12:29.452
Fucking hell... I dress up!

12:32.623 --> 12:33.923
Is this the door?

12:48.682 --> 12:50.762
You don't see that every day.

12:50.882 --> 12:53.241
It's open!

12:53.361 --> 12:56.481
That'll be Sid.
He's gonna take me home.

12:56.601 --> 13:00.361
Oh... Chris... Jalander.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.841
Oh, what a nice surprise.

13:02.961 --> 13:04.801
Came just at the right time.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.182
Right...

13:08.907 --> 13:10.261
Where's Sid?

13:13.176 --> 13:14.181
Ah! Hi, guys.

13:14.845 --> 13:17.321
Hi, Tony, Chris.
Hello, funny name.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.404
Where'd you lot spring from?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.201
Just finished seeing to Tony.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.618
Yeah. She was...

13:23.738 --> 13:25.021
seeing to him...

13:25.748 --> 13:27.640
Great. How are you, lad?

13:27.760 --> 13:30.110
Better, thanks.
She's got warm hands.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.459
Oh, they're lovely and warm.
Always say that.

13:36.365 --> 13:39.160
So you're all dancing
the night away tonight, huh?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.220
Yeah... bit of a party!

13:41.871 --> 13:44.019
- It's not really a party.
- Yeah, that's right.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.680
What party?

13:56.662 --> 13:59.439
Look, sorry, Tone. But your mum
says we gotta take you home.

13:59.808 --> 14:02.399
Maybe your folks think it's
a bit too soon to be going out.

14:02.519 --> 14:03.679
Fuck my folks.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.345
Where's Sid?

14:09.279 --> 14:11.719
He couldn't make it, mate.

14:12.366 --> 14:14.199
His dad made him stay in and...

14:14.319 --> 14:15.352
Mow the grass.

14:15.472 --> 14:17.922
Yeah, that's it.
He's mowing the grass.

14:18.279 --> 14:19.959
He couldn't make it, Tony.

14:20.079 --> 14:22.159
All right?
Sid couldn't make it...

14:55.373 --> 14:58.238
Hey! Hi, Sid!
When are you coming to see me?

14:58.778 --> 15:01.435
Everyone's so lovely in Elgin.

15:01.555 --> 15:04.518
Here's my new friends,
Rory and Lachlan.

15:05.752 --> 15:08.247
- All right, wee man?
- Hello there, Sidney.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.517
Rory's going to let me
blow his chanter later.

15:10.637 --> 15:12.917
It's easy.
Ye just need to learn tae finger it.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.317
And I've already been
beating Lachlan's bodhran.

15:15.437 --> 15:16.529
Magic! Aye!

15:16.897 --> 15:18.558
- What?!
- I'm not very good.

15:18.678 --> 15:20.197
Aye, ye are!

15:20.317 --> 15:24.067
Anyway, there's a present in there,
Sid. And watch what I can do.

15:59.506 --> 16:02.236
Mighty fucking Scotland.

16:07.838 --> 16:08.837
Hoots!

16:09.576 --> 16:12.036
Don't you care what I want?!
Don't I get to decide?

16:12.156 --> 16:16.135
Yeah. You're gonna decide to be a
builder who dances in his spare time.

16:16.295 --> 16:18.113
I don't want to be
a fucking builder!

16:18.233 --> 16:20.522
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing. Nothing.

16:20.642 --> 16:22.815
I just... I can do this, Dad!

16:25.555 --> 16:28.203
You don't think I can do it, do you?

16:28.323 --> 16:29.455
No, lad.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.055
Fucking hell! Thanks, Dad.

16:33.174 --> 16:34.890
It's not my fault, is it!?

16:35.010 --> 16:36.048
What?

16:36.168 --> 16:38.542
That you're stuck in a fucking
white van all your life.

16:38.662 --> 16:41.654
Don't you speak to me like that! I'll
clout you round the fucking earhole.

16:41.815 --> 16:43.366
Like you clout the fucking dog?!

16:43.486 --> 16:45.518
Don't bring the fucking dog into it.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.516
I'll have no fucking
swearing in this house.

16:47.636 --> 16:49.853
Mum fucking swears
at you all the time.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.074
Don't wait.

16:55.194 --> 16:56.954
We said we'd take you home.

16:57.074 --> 16:59.394
Don't wanna go home.

16:59.514 --> 17:01.854
# Groove upon the party

17:02.354 --> 17:05.394
# Yo, when I'm cruising
in my Lamborghini

17:05.513 --> 17:08.415
# The chicks see me, they go,

17:08.536 --> 17:10.794
# "Mmm, wow, he's so sexy"

17:11.294 --> 17:14.034
# And I might get my shot
for the end of the night

17:14.154 --> 17:17.154
# Cos pussy is pussy and baby,
you're pussy for life

17:19.893 --> 17:22.051
# I wanna fuck you, fuck you

17:22.214 --> 17:24.073
# You already know

17:24.193 --> 17:26.433
# I wanna fuck you, fuck you... #

17:26.553 --> 17:28.753
Argh! Ow!

17:28.873 --> 17:30.793
Oh... Fuckin' hell...

17:30.913 --> 17:32.673
Sorry.

17:33.499 --> 17:35.433
I gotta remember
to stand pimp in these.

17:35.553 --> 17:37.064
What's happening, "blood"?

17:37.184 --> 17:40.287
I'm in for some serious slippy-slidey
todger action at this party, man!

17:40.407 --> 17:42.953
It's not... really a party.

17:43.073 --> 17:44.172
Are you pissing me?

17:44.334 --> 17:47.433
It's the biggest night of the year.
Everybody's going!

17:47.553 --> 17:48.903
Yeah, except Tony.

17:50.193 --> 17:51.773
Shame, man. It's gonna be...

17:56.277 --> 17:58.952
Tony can't go. Remember?

18:01.818 --> 18:03.012
Fuckers...

18:05.492 --> 18:06.452
Come on, mate.

18:09.192 --> 18:11.752
I told you to keep quiet
about the sodding rave.

18:11.872 --> 18:14.187
And why are you dressed
as a crack dealer?

18:14.508 --> 18:15.815
You think it's too much?

18:15.935 --> 18:17.327
If I'd just met you,

18:17.447 --> 18:19.286
I'd rather slit my wrists
than give you one.

18:19.406 --> 18:21.405
That's because you don't
give anyone one.

18:21.525 --> 18:23.907
Watch out or they'll take
your tits into care.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.912
Because they don't get out enough.

18:27.456 --> 18:29.951
You geddit? Your tits...

18:32.470 --> 18:33.770
Hello, Mr Stonem.

18:36.351 --> 18:38.001
Wondered where you were.

18:42.751 --> 18:44.290
Thanks for bringing him back.

18:44.451 --> 18:47.431
That's all right.
No problem. Maybe we'll pop round...

18:47.865 --> 18:49.058
tomorrow.

18:52.053 --> 18:53.727
Let's go get fucked.

18:58.686 --> 19:00.995
Are you not going
to have anything, Tony?

19:01.817 --> 19:02.817
No.

19:03.691 --> 19:04.691
OK.

19:06.001 --> 19:07.974
So, um, what did you get up to today?

19:08.094 --> 19:09.384
He shouldn't be going out!

19:09.504 --> 19:11.850
He's wandering around,
God knows where...

19:11.970 --> 19:15.730
We don't even know who he's with!
He could have a bleed or a fit or...

19:15.890 --> 19:17.730
Yeah, Jim. He's here.

19:19.865 --> 19:20.970
Oh, fuck it.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.150
Fuck it.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.310
Fuck it.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.690
All right, all right. Just...
for Christ's sake, eat something!

19:28.306 --> 19:29.716
Look, Mum's made it easy.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.921
It's all... lovely and...

19:32.041 --> 19:33.490
bite-sized.

19:37.909 --> 19:39.869
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:39.989 --> 19:42.629
Come on, let's talk about
something else. Come on.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.289
Yeah, yeah.
What do you want to talk about?

19:47.109 --> 19:48.549
Dirty jokes.

19:48.669 --> 19:49.589
What?

19:49.709 --> 19:51.749
Maxxie's mum says
your jokes are filthy.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.209
You saw Jackie Oliver today?

19:55.329 --> 19:58.709
Jackie probably was thinking
about someone else. Right, Anthea?

19:58.829 --> 20:00.449
Yeah, yeah...

20:04.211 --> 20:07.829
Anyway... This mate of mine's
been going to the doctor.

20:07.949 --> 20:08.988
Who's that?

20:09.108 --> 20:12.308
Er, don't think you know him.
Um, anyway he had to have some tests,

20:12.428 --> 20:15.588
had palpitations or something...
So, he eventually goes back

20:15.708 --> 20:18.468
to the doctor to get the results
and, er, the doctor says,

20:18.588 --> 20:22.288
"Sit down. I'm afraid there's
good news and there's bad news.

20:22.448 --> 20:25.127
"The bad news is
you've only got a month to live."

20:25.665 --> 20:27.928
My mate's like,
devastated, he's gutted.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.959
But he pulls himself together and
he says, "What's the good news?"

20:32.079 --> 20:34.135
And the doctor says,
"See my new receptionist?

20:34.255 --> 20:36.348
"Blonde. Great arse. Huge tits.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.118
"Well, I'm fucking her."

20:43.507 --> 20:44.793
That's crap.

20:47.809 --> 20:48.809
Yeah...

20:49.207 --> 20:52.257
My name's Anthea Stonem.
Thank you and good night.

20:58.687 --> 21:01.214
They'll take her tits into care...

21:02.131 --> 21:03.427
They're gonna...

21:04.936 --> 21:06.667
They don't get out enough!

21:07.987 --> 21:09.307
I got it!

21:09.427 --> 21:10.427
I got it!

21:20.400 --> 21:23.280
Look, I've told you before, he's not
leaving college. That's it!

21:23.400 --> 21:25.983
You don't need to be such
a monster man about it!

21:26.103 --> 21:27.439
Who's being a monster man?

21:27.559 --> 21:28.544
You is.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.899
What's eating you,
you big old bully!?

21:31.120 --> 21:33.880
Nothing! Nothing.
Just leave it alone.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.840
He's not leaving, that's final.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.519
All right, Walter.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.959
Bandy... How you doin'?

21:49.180 --> 21:51.640
Only passable, Walter.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.000
It seems like my Dale
has overstepped his mouth.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.600
Little misunderstanding, that's it.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.240
What have you gotta say, dildohead?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.840
Sorry, Mr Oliver.

22:07.061 --> 22:08.289
And...?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.680
Sorry, Max.

22:11.669 --> 22:14.520
He's baked a cake of remorse.

22:24.539 --> 22:25.616
Very nice.

22:25.736 --> 22:27.698
So we're all right then, Walter?

22:27.860 --> 22:30.679
Water under the bridge, Bandy.
How's the wife?

22:30.799 --> 22:32.618
Oh, not bad.
They gave her early release.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.378
Still gotta wear
the electronic tag, of course.

22:35.540 --> 22:36.919
Bummer.

22:37.100 --> 22:40.119
And they've banned her for life

22:40.300 --> 22:43.019
from operating a concrete mixer
or a cattle prod.

22:43.919 --> 22:45.418
It's probably for the best.

24:45.197 --> 24:49.197
Oh, Tony! For fuck's sake. Come on!

24:55.059 --> 24:56.209
Fucking hell.

24:56.379 --> 24:57.758
Get off!

25:01.838 --> 25:03.718
Oh, fuck.

25:45.596 --> 25:47.156
Tony?

25:47.276 --> 25:49.256
Are you all right?

25:49.681 --> 25:50.681
No.

25:51.757 --> 25:54.117
Nobody wants me
to come out any more.

25:54.237 --> 25:55.816
Oh, fuck it. Come anyway.

25:57.477 --> 25:59.957
My dad won't let me
go back to college.

26:00.077 --> 26:02.477
And mine won't let me leave.

26:02.597 --> 26:04.317
We're both bummed, bruv.

26:05.917 --> 26:07.817
Why doesn't Sid come any more?

26:09.178 --> 26:10.759
Can't remember when he was here.

26:10.879 --> 26:12.329
He misses you, Tony.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.596
I miss me.

26:17.796 --> 26:20.396
Come out. I'll get you dancing.

26:20.624 --> 26:21.536
Yeah?

26:21.697 --> 26:23.716
You gonna gay me?

26:23.836 --> 26:25.756
Hey... Tony's here.

26:34.916 --> 26:37.316
Who's that?

26:43.537 --> 26:45.436
Hello, everybody.

26:46.532 --> 26:50.737
I'd like to sing a little ditty
that I hope you'll rather enjoy.

26:51.196 --> 26:53.415
Alastair, would you mind
pressing play, please?

26:53.577 --> 26:55.636
Thanks awfully.

26:58.136 --> 27:00.975
Gimme a riddim blood. Mi
gonna tear it up with a back ender.

27:01.137 --> 27:05.316
I wanna hear it big, blud.
I wanna hear it hit out, blud!

27:05.436 --> 27:08.836
I wanna hear it massive!
Cos we're takin' it uptown!

28:04.496 --> 28:05.546
Hey! Maxxie!

28:05.776 --> 28:06.776
Monkey Man!

28:49.875 --> 28:51.283
Fuck me...

28:53.675 --> 28:55.137
You're just a kid.

28:57.824 --> 28:59.954
- You're mental.
- Thanks.

29:02.234 --> 29:03.194
Ready?

29:20.034 --> 29:21.984
Hey, Jal! Where's your moves?

29:40.193 --> 29:42.993
Fuck me senseless.

29:43.113 --> 29:44.013
Whoa!

29:47.294 --> 29:50.474
Yeah. He's hot, man.

29:51.954 --> 29:53.834
Ah, you gay boy!

30:56.393 --> 31:00.313
Here I come, Cas. I'm coming!

31:27.752 --> 31:29.272
It's OK, Tony.

31:29.392 --> 31:30.832
Come on.

31:35.232 --> 31:37.192
No way. Look who's coming.

31:37.413 --> 31:39.432
It's Tony Stonem.

31:40.672 --> 31:42.152
Oh, my God!

31:42.373 --> 31:46.472
Tony, hi! You look so OK.

31:46.653 --> 31:49.032
Not like... Well, they said
you were like a total mong,

31:49.152 --> 31:51.872
and I would have been so pissed
if you were a vegetable

31:51.992 --> 31:53.912
and had to be switched off, yah?

31:54.032 --> 31:56.733
- Do I know you?
- Tony! You do...

31:56.978 --> 31:59.472
You know me really rather well.

31:59.592 --> 32:01.552
Remember?

32:02.052 --> 32:05.112
You were a very naughty boy.

32:05.293 --> 32:07.992
But I forgive you...

32:08.112 --> 32:11.112
Is it all still working, yah?

32:11.293 --> 32:12.571
Sorry. Can't place you.

32:12.733 --> 32:16.091
You remember, Tony. How you said
I was like your total dream shag?

32:16.252 --> 32:17.091
Said that?

32:17.253 --> 32:20.051
Because Michelle had the funny tits,
and was so boring,

32:20.213 --> 32:23.631
and you wanted to go out with me cos
I had the longest tongue you ever...

32:23.751 --> 32:26.271
He can't... place you.

32:28.252 --> 32:30.231
Come on, Tone.

32:36.092 --> 32:37.791
Tongue?

32:39.151 --> 32:40.591
Oh, yeah.

33:17.171 --> 33:18.211
Get off!

33:22.631 --> 33:23.671
Help!

33:26.711 --> 33:28.551
Wanna get out!

33:28.671 --> 33:30.110
Tony!

33:48.391 --> 33:50.471
Get the fuck out my way, will you!

33:57.972 --> 33:59.280
Tony!

34:01.991 --> 34:03.430
Tone?

34:25.590 --> 34:27.340
Stop fucking about, yeah?

34:30.251 --> 34:32.590
Wait... Wait.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.129
All right, Blowjob.

34:40.869 --> 34:42.088
Faggot.

34:43.328 --> 34:44.328
Cocksucker!

34:44.453 --> 34:46.149
- Wanker!
- All right, gay boy?

34:46.268 --> 34:48.070
Fucking get him! Get him!

35:24.989 --> 35:26.469
Tossers.

35:47.204 --> 35:49.128
Sent them the other way.

35:51.189 --> 35:52.688
The fucking cake.

35:53.621 --> 35:56.349
I should've knew it when I saw
the hundreds and thousands.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.447
Lemon Drizzle. It's a piece of piss.

36:01.789 --> 36:03.309
Dale.

36:03.429 --> 36:06.208
You can't just
treat me like shit and then just...

36:08.229 --> 36:10.389
Just...

36:12.469 --> 36:13.568
Ah... fuck it!

36:29.028 --> 36:30.628
Jim? What's wrong?

36:30.748 --> 36:33.068
Sorry it's so late...

36:33.188 --> 36:34.647
I've lost Tony.

36:35.668 --> 36:37.588
He doesn't answer his phone.

36:39.228 --> 36:41.188
I don't even know if he can.

36:46.068 --> 36:47.949
I can't keep him in. But...

36:50.069 --> 36:51.407
He's not right.

36:53.438 --> 36:54.778
Who is?

36:55.148 --> 36:56.327
Everything's mental.

36:57.428 --> 36:59.348
This competition last week.

36:59.468 --> 37:02.028
Fucking break-dancing chihuahua.

37:02.148 --> 37:05.007
I mean, what's it come to?

37:07.188 --> 37:08.239
Right.

37:12.668 --> 37:16.348
You never know what's gonna happen
till you're sitting in a hospital.

37:19.308 --> 37:22.405
And I'm thinking, I've really,
really fucked up here,

37:23.228 --> 37:25.678
because I'm supposed
to stop this happening.

37:27.726 --> 37:29.942
And now I don't know where he is.

37:34.427 --> 37:37.307
Something happens,
suddenly you've lost them.

37:46.188 --> 37:48.068
His friends'll look after him.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
What you on?

38:48.115 --> 38:49.770
Cass sent me a tab.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.920
She misses you, right?

38:58.999 --> 39:01.348
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

39:02.558 --> 39:04.237
I go to see him.

39:06.837 --> 39:08.513
I went to see him.

39:10.077 --> 39:12.356
Well, I suppose
you deserve some fun.

39:13.556 --> 39:15.636
Those guys just like my tits.

39:16.657 --> 39:18.066
Oh. Sweet.

39:22.995 --> 39:24.791
You're avoiding me.

39:25.955 --> 39:27.474
You make me think about him.

39:27.594 --> 39:29.722
You're not the only one, Chelle.

39:29.842 --> 39:33.634
I was there every day trying
to get him to say something.

39:34.211 --> 39:37.992
And everybody really, really
fucked up and I'm just trying to...

39:40.512 --> 39:43.391
And nobody comes but me
cos it's so terrible.

39:44.831 --> 39:47.030
You should have fucking helped me.

39:47.231 --> 39:48.511
All right!

39:53.190 --> 39:54.790
When it happened...

39:56.470 --> 39:58.148
before the bus...

39:59.869 --> 40:01.696
... he was on the phone,

40:02.098 --> 40:04.669
... he was on the phone

40:04.789 --> 40:06.587
I don't think he remembers.

40:06.748 --> 40:08.290
- But he said...
- Chelle.

40:08.410 --> 40:11.009
Fuck's sake, I'm trying
to tell you this!

40:15.186 --> 40:16.186
Oh, Jesus!

40:19.626 --> 40:21.064
Tony?

40:24.305 --> 40:25.184
Hello.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.743
Wait, I'll go back with you.

40:39.131 --> 40:40.583
Effy's taking me.

40:44.021 --> 40:45.871
I will remember everything.

41:06.938 --> 41:08.138
Where are you going?

41:08.258 --> 41:09.617
Not now, Sid!

41:47.454 --> 41:48.891
Got lost.

41:51.051 --> 41:53.610
Where do I fucking live?

42:00.369 --> 42:03.289
Walter will run him round
in the morning.

42:03.409 --> 42:05.449
Look, don't worry yourselves, OK.

42:10.608 --> 42:11.887
She's a bit upset.

42:13.048 --> 42:14.207
Yeah.

42:16.207 --> 42:17.726
College starts today.

42:23.365 --> 42:24.564
He's in there, love.

42:26.605 --> 42:28.845
Talking, not shouting.

42:28.965 --> 42:29.964
OK.

42:46.962 --> 42:49.041
Lovely bit of cake, that.

42:51.439 --> 42:53.160
Young Dale's got the magic touch.

42:54.841 --> 42:56.490
He's got that all right.

43:00.439 --> 43:02.150
You're good enough.

43:03.359 --> 43:05.159
Yeah. I am.

43:06.199 --> 43:08.037
I'm bloody good.

43:08.567 --> 43:10.437
Get it from your old man, probably.

43:11.291 --> 43:12.291
Reckon?

43:13.118 --> 43:14.341
I'm artistic, yeah.

43:15.797 --> 43:18.956
Not as artistic as you, mind.

43:20.157 --> 43:23.015
Some things is just
the way they are.

43:24.286 --> 43:25.326
Yup.

43:29.116 --> 43:30.354
I got lucky, didn't I?

43:32.074 --> 43:35.794
You didn't turn out like
the fucking ASBO Army out there.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.274
No, Dad.

43:37.394 --> 43:40.433
I feel like taking some
fucking credit for it. OK?

43:42.713 --> 43:44.912
I'm never gonna be a builder, Dad.

43:46.592 --> 43:48.842
You'll understand this one day, kid.

43:51.339 --> 43:53.511
You're everything
I've got to show for my life.

43:56.031 --> 43:58.618
And I'm not ready for you to go,

43:58.991 --> 44:00.830
because I fucking love you too much.

44:03.469 --> 44:05.108
I'm an idiot, I know.

44:05.269 --> 44:06.988
I love you too, Dad.

44:10.508 --> 44:13.907
So if you're not coming building,
back to college.

44:16.148 --> 44:18.107
Give me the last year.

44:18.227 --> 44:19.826
And then it's game on. All right?

44:22.186 --> 44:23.186
All right.

44:28.506 --> 44:29.865
Taz. On your bed.

44:34.705 --> 44:37.454
At least the sodding dog
does what he's told.

44:52.622 --> 44:54.821
I can register if I write my name.

44:56.741 --> 44:58.421
It's more than that, Tony.

44:58.541 --> 45:01.101
It's not just signing your name.

45:01.221 --> 45:02.659
Then fucking help me!

45:02.779 --> 45:04.900
Or are you gonna be
a complete fucking arse-wit

45:05.020 --> 45:06.700
like everyone fucking else I know?

45:06.820 --> 45:09.140
Whoa! He speaks.

45:09.580 --> 45:12.018
You gotta slow it down.

45:12.138 --> 45:14.298
Stop trying to write.

45:14.418 --> 45:16.578
It's just a shape your hand makes.

45:23.657 --> 45:26.776
Close your eyes and just kinda...

45:26.896 --> 45:28.336
dance it.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.933
Tone.

45:59.411 --> 46:01.051
Do I have to gay you now?

46:58.602 --> 47:00.441
Who are you?

47:00.602 --> 47:02.040
Shit!

47:03.602 --> 47:04.879
Hang on...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.519
You're fucking crazy!
