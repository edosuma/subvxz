Miss Martian's language
to Forager?

04:28.571 --> 04:30.740

apparently.

Have you tried

They're incredible.

Uh, that's another--

04:52.929 --> 04:56.265
New Genesis is one of

to the New Gods.

Well, you would
think that, wouldn't you?

Forager's life was in danger

-No. Not a car.

06:49.778 --> 06:51.781
Sorry.

Besides, I should know better
than to bring anything
spillable to Marstown.

-Marstown?
-Little Mars?

06:56.919 --> 06:58.922
Never mind.

-I have never lived in
a recreational vehicle before.

07:02.758 --> 07:04.661
Neither has Forager.

07:04.727 --> 07:08.698
Brion, Halo,
I kind of promised Dr. Jace
she could talk to you.

07:08.765 --> 07:12.602
<i>Prince Brion, Halo,
</i> <i>I've been so worried
</i> <i>about you both.</i>

07:12.669 --> 07:15.304
<i>-I want--
-We are fine, Dr. Jace.</i>

07:15.371 --> 07:17.440
<i>I owe you some answers.
</i> <i>I know.</i>

07:17.507 --> 07:19.141
BRION:
I have only one question.

07:19.208 --> 07:22.879
Is my sister...
Is Tara still alive?

07:22.946 --> 07:25.982
<i>I believe she is.
</i> <i>At least she was.</i>

07:26.049 --> 07:29.251
<i>I tried to protect her
</i> <i>for as long as I could.</i>

07:29.318 --> 07:31.921
<i>But soon after her Meta-Gene
</i> <i>was activated,</i>

07:31.988 --> 07:35.257
<i>your uncle
</i> <i>took her away from me
</i> <i>and shipped her off to...</i>

07:35.324 --> 07:37.293
<i>To I don't know where.</i>

07:37.360 --> 07:39.828
So she did have
the Meta-Gene.

07:39.895 --> 07:41.096
What were her powers?

07:41.163 --> 07:43.166
<i>I never saw.</i>

07:43.233 --> 07:46.636
But since you and Baron DeLamb
<i>both have different
</i> <i>types of Geo-Force,</i>

07:46.703 --> 07:49.438
<i>it stands to reason
</i> <i>that as your blood relative,</i>

<i>Tara would have
</i> <i>a similar power set.</i>

07:51.574 --> 07:53.909
DICK: That's what
we were thinking, too.

07:53.976 --> 07:56.612
-"We"?
-Uh, me.

07:56.679 --> 07:59.849
A man named Jaqqar Marlo
was killed this morning
by a meta-human

07:59.916 --> 08:02.219
who dropped
a massive rock
on his head.

08:02.285 --> 08:07.256
Black Spider, an assassin
from the League of Shadows
was also spotted in the area.

08:07.323 --> 08:10.060
Boulder-dropping
isn't his style.

08:10.126 --> 08:14.629
So, the possibility
does exist that your sister
is now with the Shadows.

08:14.696 --> 08:15.798
No.

08:15.865 --> 08:18.101
<i>Princess Tara
</i> <i>would never kill.</i>

08:18.168 --> 08:21.270
<i>They must be using
</i> <i>a control device upon her.</i>

08:21.337 --> 08:23.472
Like they did
with Plasmus and his sister.

08:23.539 --> 08:26.475
<i>The princess must be
</i> <i>rescued from these Shadows.</i>

08:26.542 --> 08:29.445
Yes, we must rescue her now!

08:29.512 --> 08:32.682
Brion, I want you
to literally chill.

08:32.749 --> 08:35.418
We don't know conclusively
that this was Tara

08:35.484 --> 08:38.254
or even that it was someone
with a Geo-Force power.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.423
A telekinetic
could've moved that boulder.

08:40.489 --> 08:42.558
Or someone with super strength
could've chucked it.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.995
Do you know
where the Shadows are
or not?

08:46.062 --> 08:48.598
(SIGHS) They're based
on Infinity Island.

08:48.664 --> 08:50.566
But that doesn't guarantee
Tara's with them.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.535
There's one way to find out.

08:52.602 --> 08:55.571
The League of Shadows
is run by Ra's al Ghul,

08:55.638 --> 08:57.807
the Demon's Head,
a member of the Light,

08:57.874 --> 09:00.110
and one of the most
dangerous men on the planet.

09:00.176 --> 09:04.012
We are not facing al Ghul
and all his Shadows
without more intel

09:04.079 --> 09:05.514

I suppose I should explore

11:37.466 --> 11:41.370
(BEEPING)

11:41.437 --> 11:43.106
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Grayson.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.775
You really need to work
on your pet names.

11:45.842 --> 11:48.944
Just got Halo's ID.
Her real name's
Gabrielle Daou.

11:49.011 --> 11:50.313
Oh, that's great.

11:50.380 --> 11:55.380
We should go tell her.
It might summon some memories.

11:56.886 --> 11:59.488
They're gone.
All three of them.

11:59.555 --> 12:01.723
Wolf, where are the kids?

12:01.790 --> 12:03.025
(WHINES)

12:03.091 --> 12:04.426
Thanks, Wolf.

12:04.493 --> 12:06.128
They can't have gone far.

12:06.195 --> 12:09.345
Wait. Where's Sphere?

12:17.040 --> 12:19.308
-Super-Cycle, take us down.
-(SUPER-CYCLE CHIRPS)

12:19.375 --> 12:20.575
Quietly.

12:32.388 --> 12:35.023
It would seem
we need to go there.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.790
(BIRDS SCREECHING)

12:49.239 --> 12:51.340
We're on a mission.
A rescue mission, correct?

12:51.407 --> 12:53.576
Yes, of course.
But, Halo, please.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.245
And that's
my mission name. Halo.

12:55.311 --> 12:57.947
I like it, but I think I need
a secret identity name, too.

12:58.014 --> 13:01.183
Like how Artemis
is Tigress on a mission,
but Artemis at home.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.685
Forager is Forager.

13:02.752 --> 13:04.887
All right. But at home,
I think I'll be Violet.

13:04.954 --> 13:06.255
It's what
you called me, Brion.

13:06.321 --> 13:07.656
What? When?

13:07.723 --> 13:09.225
-You don't rember?
-Violet.

13:09.292 --> 13:11.993
No, I'm Violet at home.
Here, I'm halo.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.430
Fine. Halo.

13:14.496 --> 13:17.796
Something's not right.

13:20.437 --> 13:24.473
Grayson said this was
an entire island of assassins.

13:24.540 --> 13:29.044
But there's no one here.

13:29.111 --> 13:30.546
Human is here.

13:30.613 --> 13:32.481
Hush, children.

13:32.548 --> 13:35.451
I am trying to meditate.

13:35.518 --> 13:38.721
And I am trying
to find my sister!

13:38.788 --> 13:42.257
Then your search
has gone astray,

13:42.324 --> 13:44.593
Brion Markov.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.329
You know who I am.

13:46.396 --> 13:50.066
SENSEI: Who doesn't know
of the foolish
and impatient prince

13:50.133 --> 13:53.469
banished from his kingdom
on live television?

13:53.536 --> 13:56.205
You seek the missing princess,

13:56.271 --> 13:58.607
but will not find her here.

13:58.674 --> 14:01.610
Is this
Infinity Island or not?

14:01.677 --> 14:04.480
(SIGHS) It is.

14:04.547 --> 14:07.216
Then where is
your army of ninjas?

14:07.282 --> 14:09.652
I don't need an army.

14:09.719 --> 14:12.421
I trained the army.

14:12.488 --> 14:16.838
You didn't train them for me.

14:24.433 --> 14:25.768
CONNER:
I can't believe this.

14:25.835 --> 14:28.303
They've only been
living in here five minutes.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.839
It's already a mess.

14:29.906 --> 14:31.641
You're sure they went
to Infinity Island?

14:31.708 --> 14:35.377
The one place
we very specifically
told them not to go?

14:35.444 --> 14:36.679
Yep.

14:36.746 --> 14:39.314
Well, what goes around
comes around.

14:39.381 --> 14:40.482
What's that supposed to mean?

14:40.549 --> 14:43.519
Uh, "Cadmus" ring any bells?

14:43.586 --> 14:47.656
Oh, man. I hate
being the grown-up.

14:47.723 --> 14:50.492
My sister was abducted
by the League of Shadows.

14:50.559 --> 14:52.361
I'm here to bring her home.

14:52.428 --> 14:56.032
As far as I can tell, boy,

14:56.099 --> 14:59.234
you are here
to make a fool of yourself.

14:59.301 --> 15:00.803
Tell me where my sister is!

15:00.870 --> 15:05.708
Perhaps your sister chooses
not to be found by you.

15:05.775 --> 15:07.910
I've hardly known you
five minutes,

15:07.977 --> 15:11.179
but already sympathize
with such a decision.

And you have ruined
my meditation space.

(GRUNTS)

15:40.609 --> 15:41.911
Wasn't that hot?

Pain is an illusion.

15:46.782 --> 15:50.019
Now, all of you stand down.

-Let go of her!

drain from her, Master.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.788
I swear it.

17:32.855 --> 17:35.091
Resurrection does
happen here, huh?

Boy, the Shadows may indeed
have your sister,

19:36.446 --> 19:39.014
but I'm no longer
head of the Shadows.

As you can see,
there are no Shadows here.

part of the Light.

care to reveal who is
running the Shadows now?

No, he would not.

I had to rescue Robin,
Kid Flash, and Aqualad, too.

-Who?
-Forager met Kid Flash.

20:52.788 --> 20:54.223

20:54.290 --> 20:56.192
(SIGHS) Never mind.

20:56.259 --> 20:59.696
Let's make one thing clear.
We are not happy.

20:59.763 --> 21:04.763
You stole Sphere,
disobeyed direct orders,
and endangered your lives.

21:04.934 --> 21:07.203
You will not be
doing this again.

21:07.270 --> 21:09.905

I need your help.

-Neither am I.

Forager rolls
with Forager's hive.

21:17.413 --> 21:20.016
Forager, there's still a place
for you on the team.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.419
Forager has chosen
Halo and Brion
as Forager's hive.

21:23.486 --> 21:27.323
Also, Bio Ship.
Especially Bio Ship.

21:27.390 --> 21:31.227
I do not believe any of us
would fit inside your team.

21:31.294 --> 21:35.431
But we can remain
outside together.

21:35.498 --> 21:37.733
That's the commitment
we were looking for.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.068
Does that mean--

21:39.135 --> 21:41.570
Yep. We'll find a way
to make it work.

21:41.637 --> 21:43.372
To make this work.

21:43.439 --> 21:46.309
And just like that,
you're leading another team.

is beyond me.
