-These are wrong cops.

00:18.733 --> 00:21.167
You're with him on the job, all night.

00:21.373 --> 00:25.525
-lt hasn't worked out yet, Mr. Marino.
-Clip him. Pull the trigger.

00:26.773 --> 00:29.128
What happened?
Did you take Marino out?

00:29.293 --> 00:32.968
Even if l did, the case wouldn't make.

Yeah, Mom's good.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.011
What's up?

01:28.093 --> 01:31.449
l wanted to see you
before you found something out.

01:31.613 --> 01:36.767
They're making an announcement.
Some cops are gonna be indicted.

01:37.213 --> 01:39.568
l'm gonna be one of them.

01:41.773 --> 01:44.446
lt's out of this Giardella testimony.

01:44.613 --> 01:49.846
They're gonna say l took money from
Angelo Marino, l was on his payroll.

01:53.573 --> 01:56.406
How come you don't ask if it's true?

01:58.053 --> 02:00.487
You tell me what you want to tell me.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.645
They paid me for giving up warrants.

02:03.813 --> 02:07.044
When l was on Gambling
and Narcotics. . .

02:07.213 --> 02:10.568
. . .l tipped them if there was
gonna be a raid.

02:10.733 --> 02:14.726
lt's been over for five years,
but l did it.

02:14.893 --> 02:18.522
l'm glad when you joined the force,
you used Mom's name.

02:18.693 --> 02:22.732
How you feel is one thing, but at
least no one knows we're related.

02:22.933 --> 02:26.164
l'm not ashamed to be your daughter.

02:29.653 --> 02:32.247
l want you to know l'm proud of you.

02:32.973 --> 02:37.683
l've always been proud of
the kind of cop you are.

02:37.853 --> 02:41.323
l'll always be glad for that part.

02:41.493 --> 02:44.485
That these bastards
never reached out to you.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.405
You okay?
You got someone you can talk to?

02:54.613 --> 02:57.730
Yeah. Daddy, l'm fine.

04:14.013 --> 04:15.731
Brown Appetite

05:02.373 --> 05:04.648
Sipowicz, what are you doing here?

05:04.813 --> 05:08.044
-l heard that rat's leaving town.
-Keep him inside.

05:08.213 --> 05:11.410
-They're taking Giardella to D.C.?
-That's our business.

05:11.573 --> 05:15.566
He put six bullets in me,
l shouldn't wonder what's going on?

05:15.733 --> 05:19.362
l know what Giardella did to you,
but you can't be here.

05:19.613 --> 05:24.050
Get out, or you'll be arrested
for interfering with federal marshals.

05:24.213 --> 05:28.126
How's it going, Alfonse?
Are you hiding under the bedcovers?

05:28.293 --> 05:32.286
What is it, Sipowicz,
you want to see the rest of my suite?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.327
There it is, the ugliest wig
in America.

05:35.493 --> 05:39.850
Douche bag, l got 24-hour room service
and three dirty-movie channels.

05:40.053 --> 05:44.729
How'd you like to watch them from a
hole in the middle of your forehead?

05:44.973 --> 05:46.486
That's it, get out!

05:46.693 --> 05:50.481
That's a good look for you!
Mix that mud in with your rug!

05:50.653 --> 05:52.644
He's a savage, out of the trees!

05:52.813 --> 05:55.646
l'm not done!
We're going around again.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.327
-Do not come back here.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.446
COP:

06:02.613 --> 06:04.410
-Hey. What's up?
KELLY: Thanks.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.451
Detective Kelly,
is this gonna go on forever?

06:07.613 --> 06:09.808
What's that?

06:10.053 --> 06:12.886
-You pretending l don't exist.
-You got guts.

06:13.053 --> 06:16.807
Figure yourself lucky
l don't collar you for homicide.

06:16.973 --> 06:20.010
Could l just talk to you?
l need to talk to you.

06:20.173 --> 06:21.970
No. l know what happened.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.011
You were dirty,
you were getting squeezed. . .

06:25.173 --> 06:27.733
. . .you whacked Marino to get loose.

06:27.893 --> 06:32.489
John, you're the only one
l can talk to.

06:32.773 --> 06:35.287
l can't, okay?

06:38.293 --> 06:41.922
-Regards from Harry Timmons.
-How's his security business?

06:42.093 --> 06:44.368
-Great.
-He got night work for you?

06:44.533 --> 06:47.809
l'm bodyguarding some
society people tonight.

06:47.973 --> 06:53.411
Too bad l make a lousy appearance. Busy
as l am, l could have worked a double.

06:53.573 --> 06:58.044
Andy, stay cool, all right? Fancy
wants to check on you, that's all.

06:58.213 --> 06:59.441
Oh, you think so?

06:59.613 --> 07:03.891
He's seeing if l'll set a world's record
for twiddling my thumbs.

07:04.093 --> 07:08.211
Andy, would you mind keeping an eye
on Luther again today?

07:08.413 --> 07:10.563
What am l, a kennel service here?

07:10.733 --> 07:14.442
l can't leave him alone,
and the wife's gone until Friday.

07:14.613 --> 07:18.003
-He's in the locker room?
-Yeah. You got the scooper?

07:18.213 --> 07:20.169
-l got it.
-You're a prince.

07:20.333 --> 07:26.203
Kelly, we got a residential assault,
maybe a homicide by now.

07:26.853 --> 07:30.004
-Who should l work with?
FANCY: Martinez.

07:30.213 --> 07:32.169
Sipowicz, my office.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.405
Close the door.

07:48.173 --> 07:51.449
-l just had a call from the marshals.
-ls that so?

07:51.613 --> 07:53.569
Why were you at the hotel?

07:53.733 --> 07:56.645
l was in the neighborhood.
Thought l'd say hi.

07:56.813 --> 07:58.166
l don't get you.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.211
You're on probation,
and you put on a bozo act.

08:01.413 --> 08:03.005
-He shot me.
-l know.

08:03.213 --> 08:06.888
The D.A. put him in a joint
where l can't afford a coffee.

08:07.093 --> 08:10.768
-They never should have cut a deal.
-l can't be pissed off?

08:10.973 --> 08:12.611
You can be pissed off.

08:12.773 --> 08:17.130
But you can't go down and try
to brain him with a potted plant.

08:17.293 --> 08:21.172
l used bad judgment, all right?
Maybe if l was busier--

08:21.373 --> 08:26.686
First, you stop acting like a flake,
then maybe you get back on the street.

08:26.853 --> 08:30.892
l'm taking the psycho calls,
filing stop-and-frisk reports. . .

08:31.093 --> 08:34.164
. . .doing community logs.
ls that being a flake?

08:34.332 --> 08:37.211
How long is this probation thing
gonna go on?

08:37.373 --> 08:40.763
l'm giving myself time
to make up my mind.

08:41.212 --> 08:43.283
You've already
made up your mind.

08:43.453 --> 08:47.605
You're trying to screw me
from behind that desk.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.725
You know, fellas. . .

08:59.893 --> 09:04.569
. . .l'm considering a new organizational
approach on my work area.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.530
You see this section here?

09:06.733 --> 09:12.649
This quadrant, l may reserve for these
yellow notes with glue on the back.

09:12.813 --> 09:17.967
And this area, l'm gonna restrict
to paperweights and animal magnets.

09:18.173 --> 09:20.243
Maybe those little giraffes.

09:20.453 --> 09:22.887
-Very funny.
-Nobody's being funny.

09:23.053 --> 09:25.362
l'm figuring out my work schedule.

09:25.693 --> 09:28.207
l'm under an enormous time pressure.

09:28.653 --> 09:32.566
l gotta reorganize my desk,
l gotta walk Medavoy's dog.

09:32.733 --> 09:35.611
lf it stays this hectic around here. . .

09:35.773 --> 09:39.049
. . .would l be okayed for overtime?

09:39.933 --> 09:42.049
Let's get together after work.

09:42.213 --> 09:45.171
-No ranks?
-No ranks. Just folks.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.405
-Why wait?
-After work.

09:51.213 --> 09:53.488
Kelly, you've got an assignment.

09:57.413 --> 10:00.291
-Give me another minute.
-Sure.

10:02.733 --> 10:05.247
His Highness hasn't finished his meal.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.927
What was that about with Fancy?

10:08.213 --> 10:12.764
We're getting together after work
to get to know each other better.

10:14.413 --> 10:18.167
Andy, you are on thin ice
with this guy already!

10:18.333 --> 10:20.403
How does getting in his face help?

10:20.613 --> 10:23.810
l've been in this precinct
for 17 years, John.

10:23.973 --> 10:28.012
l got informants all over.
l know every merchant, every skell.

10:28.173 --> 10:31.927
The good guys, the bad guys.
l wanna work with you again.

10:32.093 --> 10:34.288
But if the only way to get back. . .

10:34.453 --> 10:39.049
. . .because that African-American hump
won't give me a square shot. . .

10:39.213 --> 10:42.011
. . .is to put in for a transfer,
then l will.

10:42.213 --> 10:47.207
And if that's what l gotta do,
l'll get my two cents in before l go.

10:48.733 --> 10:52.248
Now, go on, get out of here.
You got a case.

10:53.493 --> 10:55.802
Go on, get out.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.811
What are you staring at?

11:01.013 --> 11:05.529
-ls that gonna be all right?
-l don't know, Martinez. l don't know.

11:14.773 --> 11:17.287

We're from the 1 5th Precinct.

11:34.013 --> 11:37.608

He brought my car back here,

16:43.413 --> 16:47.486
As matters developed in the laundry,
it was lucky l had my gun.

16:47.653 --> 16:52.488
Maybe, but then again if you didn't,
you wouldn't have been down there. . .

16:52.653 --> 16:56.248
. . .waiting for the mugger
so you could plug him, right?

16:56.453 --> 17:00.082
You're saying l should forfeit
my right to bear arms?

17:00.253 --> 17:04.883
No, l'm saying you were mugged.
That's an awful experience.

17:05.093 --> 17:09.244
Some need treatment to get over it.
Some never go outside again.

17:10.012 --> 17:13.210
And some get pissed off,
decide to square things up. . .

17:13.373 --> 17:18.401
-. . .and they start looking for trouble.
-Which is what you think l'm doing.

17:18.573 --> 17:24.364
Why don't you forget about your gun
for a while and let things unwind?

17:24.532 --> 17:29.004
No, l'm going to pursue my rights
under the Second Amendment.

17:29.693 --> 17:33.163
-Okay.
-Okay. Thank you for your time.

17:37.413 --> 17:40.371
SlPOWlCZ: You got coat hangers
hanging from your window?

17:40.533 --> 17:43.650
Did you string four hangers per pane?

17:43.813 --> 17:47.169
Radio and ultraviolet waves, yeah.

17:47.333 --> 17:52.851
Hangers neutralize any attempt to control
your mind from beyond your windows.

17:53.013 --> 17:56.528
What about aluminum foil?
Did you cover your ceiling?

17:57.013 --> 18:01.689
Well, then you're in business.
You got an alien-thought-proof room.

18:02.133 --> 18:06.570
Look, one other thing effective
with these control rays is. . .

18:06.733 --> 18:08.769
. . .refuse to think about them.

18:08.933 --> 18:12.892
Take a walk, read a book.
We call that delusion technique.

18:13.053 --> 18:17.410
Fend them off with your thoughts,
it gradually weakens their hold.

18:17.573 --> 18:21.612
All right, yeah. Wonderful.
Okay, sure thing. Keep in touch.

18:26.413 --> 18:30.452
l'm on my way to see these people
Timmons has me bodyguarding.

18:30.653 --> 18:32.962
Well, have a dandy time.

18:33.253 --> 18:34.368
Yeah.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.131
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:39.093 --> 18:42.085
This thing with the lieutenant. . . .

18:43.133 --> 18:47.046
My understanding is, you want
to be back out on the street.

18:47.733 --> 18:52.204
Remember what you're after
when you talk to somebody like him. . .

18:52.373 --> 18:55.285
-. . .then you won't fly off the handle.
-Yeah.

18:55.693 --> 18:59.572
Focus on what you want.
Then we have control.

18:59.773 --> 19:03.083
Yeah, l got you, Kelly.
l got your drift.

19:04.653 --> 19:07.292
-All right. See you later.
-Yeah.

19:25.293 --> 19:28.524
Was your father
one of the cops indicted?

19:29.053 --> 19:32.443
That what you were trying to
tell me this morning?

19:34.453 --> 19:36.967
l'm so worried about him.

19:37.133 --> 19:39.010
l'm sorry.

19:54.093 --> 20:00.248
<i>Fortune</i> magazine puts my personal
worth at over $250 million, detective.

20:00.413 --> 20:05.965
<i>Time</i> says l'm one of the 10 most
effective citizens in the country.

20:06.133 --> 20:10.684
My art collection is museum quality.

20:10.853 --> 20:14.892
None of it would mean anything
if my wife were jeopardized.

20:15.093 --> 20:19.644
-l'll try not to let that happen.
-l hope you'll do more than try.

20:19.813 --> 20:23.283
Just a way of speaking.
l won't let anything happen.

20:23.453 --> 20:26.126
Susan, this is Detective John Kelly.

20:26.933 --> 20:28.764
-Hi, ma'am.
-How do you do?

20:28.973 --> 20:33.012
Susan will tell you the details.
Do you own a tuxedo?

20:33.173 --> 20:34.606
Yes.

20:34.773 --> 20:38.652
Really? Well, if that's a fib,
bill me for the rental.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.929
Here's my schedule, Mr. Kelly.

20:43.093 --> 20:46.369
Want to benefit the National
Diabetic Fund tomorrow?

20:46.573 --> 20:47.688
Sure.

20:47.893 --> 20:51.932
-Anything else you need to know?
-Nothing comes to mind.

20:52.133 --> 20:55.682
He told you he's one of America's
most effective citizens?

20:55.853 --> 21:00.051
-His art collection is museum quality?
-Well, that came up.

21:00.213 --> 21:03.125
Good, then we're all on the same page.

21:03.453 --> 21:06.843
-l'll pick you up at 7:30 tomorrow.
-7:30 tomorrow.

21:07.013 --> 21:10.449
-l'll send my car for you.
-Okay. All right.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.971
You ready?

21:20.413 --> 21:22.085
Yeah.

21:26.773 --> 21:28.604
Catch the door.

21:33.533 --> 21:38.368
-Okay, l'm out from behind my desk.
-We'll see how far.

21:38.533 --> 21:43.482
What you said was wrong. l got opinions
about you. l think you're an asshole--

21:43.653 --> 21:47.202
-l think you are.
-lt doesn't affect how l treat you.

21:47.413 --> 21:48.732
-You think so?
-Yeah.

21:48.893 --> 21:52.568
-You guys make me laugh.
-What guys are you referring to?

21:52.773 --> 21:56.163
-Black bosses.
-Well, that didn't take long.

21:56.373 --> 22:00.446
-l'm expressing my opinions.
-For you, that means being a bigot.

22:00.613 --> 22:05.482
All l was saying is,
you guys live inside the books.

22:05.653 --> 22:09.362
You're like machines.
You go after us like robo-humps.

22:09.573 --> 22:13.771
We play it close to the vest because
people want us to mess up.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.446
Makes you nervous?

22:15.613 --> 22:18.650
Somebody always looking over
your shoulder?

22:18.853 --> 22:21.970
How exactly do you figure
l tried to screw you?

22:22.133 --> 22:24.488
l watched you crawl inside a bottle.

22:24.693 --> 22:30.450
l watched you carry on a private war
with some hood that made you crazy.

22:30.613 --> 22:35.812
l've cut you slack because you were a
good cop, and you were a good teacher.

22:36.013 --> 22:40.723
l could be that again if you would
just get your damn foot off my neck.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.646
l haven't had a drink in 63 days.

22:43.853 --> 22:47.004
-You going to meetings?
-l'm doing this my way.

22:47.173 --> 22:52.645
Sitting at home with your TV? There's
a difference between dry and sober.

22:52.853 --> 22:57.802
l just want to be able to do my job.
l don't want to have to transfer.

22:57.973 --> 23:01.852
l don't do good in new situations.
l've raised that kid.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.322
-Raised who?
-Kelly.

23:07.413 --> 23:12.043
You like this?
Seeing people embarrass themselves.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.007
You're not embarrassing yourself.

23:16.173 --> 23:17.811
Not now.

23:20.613 --> 23:22.365
l got some thinking to do.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.683
l'll see you in the morning.

23:47.133 --> 23:49.522
-Hey, how's the arm?
-A little stiff.

23:49.773 --> 23:54.324
Narcotics in the 12 picked up
the DiLeo brothers on a junkie sweep.

23:54.493 --> 23:55.642
Are they charged?

23:55.813 --> 23:58.850
They hadn't copped yet
when they got picked up.

23:59.013 --> 24:02.323
One had a VCR, says it's his mom's.
She backed him.

24:02.493 --> 24:04.927
That's my call.
Why did Narcotics talk to her?

24:05.093 --> 24:07.607
-They didn't know yet.
-Who had the VCR?

24:07.813 --> 24:10.725
-Mike, the one in the pen.
KELLY: l'll talk to him.

24:10.933 --> 24:12.810
-Want me to?
-No, l will.

24:13.013 --> 24:15.811
-No problem.
-l'll talk to him in a minute.

24:18.973 --> 24:21.407
How did it go last night?

24:21.813 --> 24:23.724
l don't know.

24:23.933 --> 24:27.608
Lieutenant said he'd inform me
today on what he decided.

24:31.693 --> 24:36.005
Sipowicz will work with you on the
Ceizler investigation.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.362
Great.

24:37.573 --> 24:43.011
-That's outdoors, indoors?
-Outdoors, indoors. Full duty.

24:44.893 --> 24:46.804
Thanks, lieutenant.

24:54.013 --> 24:57.608
-So, you understand your rights?
-Yeah.

24:57.853 --> 25:01.402
-And you don't want an attorney?
-l don't need one.

25:01.653 --> 25:05.202
Okay. lf you change your mind,
you let me know.

25:12.613 --> 25:17.164
-You're a hell of an acrobat.
-You guys scared us yesterday.

25:17.373 --> 25:23.050
-We wanted to talk about your neighbor.
-We didn't know what you guys wanted.

25:23.293 --> 25:28.083
-Did you hear what happened to her?
-Yeah, on the news and my mother said.

25:28.533 --> 25:33.243
Yeah, well, she got robbed,
strangled, and her throat was cut.

25:33.493 --> 25:35.563
We got nothing to do with it.

25:35.733 --> 25:39.726
l barely knew her.
l just knew her to say hello to.

25:39.933 --> 25:42.083
What are you doing for a living?

25:42.333 --> 25:46.042
Odd jobs, mechanical repair,
that kind of thing.

25:46.253 --> 25:51.407
l noticed the narcotics bust on
your sheet. Are you using now?

25:52.693 --> 25:56.208
l'm not 1 00 percent,
but l'm not as bad as l was.

25:57.133 --> 26:00.409
You move back in with your mom
to get straight?

26:00.613 --> 26:02.808
That's part of it.

26:03.453 --> 26:05.683
That must be tough.

26:05.893 --> 26:10.808
You're trying to get straight,
your brother's using. That's hard.

26:11.213 --> 26:13.852
He ever agitate you into getting high?

26:14.093 --> 26:16.402
You'd have to talk to him.

26:17.693 --> 26:22.209
Yeah. l'll tell you,
Michael, l don't know.

26:22.413 --> 26:26.201
lf you were involved,
l can't see you with the break-in.

26:26.413 --> 26:30.088
Not living next door.
Maybe it was your brother?

26:30.493 --> 26:35.613
l know you two were home.
You dropped your mother off at work.

26:35.893 --> 26:39.727
Maybe he was looking to break in,
get some money, get high.

26:39.933 --> 26:42.288
We weren't in that lady's house.

26:42.493 --> 26:47.009
When this happens, it's usually
a burglary gone out of whack.

26:47.253 --> 26:49.608
Nobody's meant to get hurt.

26:49.813 --> 26:52.805
lt just gets out of control.

26:54.773 --> 26:57.651
That's not what happened.
l didn't do it.

26:57.853 --> 27:01.812
How about that VCR?
Jamie steal it from your mother?

27:02.013 --> 27:04.402
She gave that to us.

27:04.813 --> 27:06.007
No.

27:06.813 --> 27:08.212
No.

27:09.373 --> 27:14.606
He took it from your mother,
but you wouldn't let him sell it.

27:20.253 --> 27:24.610
They just put me on this.
This is straight-up burglary.

27:24.813 --> 27:29.568
The woman came in, hell broke loose.
Things happened that no one meant.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.365
Look, l don't know.

27:31.573 --> 27:34.804
So you dove out a window
when the cops came?

27:35.013 --> 27:39.643
-ls it a crime to leave an apartment?
-l'm just saying that's what you did.

27:39.813 --> 27:45.524
-We call that suspicious behavior.
-Are you gonna charge me with anything?

27:47.053 --> 27:49.044
What's your hurry, Jamie?

27:49.253 --> 27:53.405
You're not jonesing on me, are you?
How long since you fixed?

27:53.613 --> 27:57.765
-You gonna charge me?
-l may hit you, you ask me that again.

27:57.973 --> 28:01.090
Up yours.
l want to be charged or released.

28:01.293 --> 28:04.126
New sneakers?
Other ones covered in blood?

28:06.253 --> 28:09.802
Watch it. Watch your balance.

28:22.093 --> 28:27.884
Detective Kelly again, Mrs. DiLeo.
That's Detective Sipowicz.

28:28.413 --> 28:29.528
Ma'am.

28:30.013 --> 28:32.732
We need to talk about
Jamie and Michael.

28:32.893 --> 28:34.326
Why?

28:34.773 --> 28:38.402
-Could we come in?
-No. They haven't done anything.

28:38.613 --> 28:41.525
You said they never had trouble
with the cops.

28:41.853 --> 28:46.085
l said not for several years.
You should let them start over.

28:46.253 --> 28:51.247
They were trying to buy heroin, and
trying to get it by selling your VCR.

28:51.413 --> 28:54.610
That's mine. lt has nothing
to do with Lois Ceizler.

28:54.773 --> 28:58.561
You're saying that you gave them
your VCR to buy heroin?

28:58.773 --> 29:01.606
l want you to leave me alone.

29:01.813 --> 29:06.011
lt gets to the point where
a mother's love isn't enough.

29:06.213 --> 29:07.646
lt isn't what they need.

29:07.813 --> 29:13.410
Your sons robbed you, took your VCR.
You're afraid they went next door.

29:13.653 --> 29:17.646
They broke in, she was home
and they did something terrible.

29:17.853 --> 29:20.413
l don't know about next door.

29:20.613 --> 29:25.846
She was robbed, strangled, her throat
was cut. How long did she live there?

29:26.093 --> 29:32.362
23 years. We both lost our husbands
within two years of each other.

29:32.613 --> 29:35.730
-She didn't deserve what happened.
-l know.

29:35.973 --> 29:39.443
Look, we want you to tell the truth
about this VCR.

29:39.693 --> 29:43.083
We wanna keep your boys
while we investigate this.

29:43.293 --> 29:48.651
While they're in custody, they get
off dope and can't hurt anybody else.

29:48.853 --> 29:53.483
We're not charging for next door.
Maybe we'll find they weren't involved.

29:53.773 --> 29:58.801
l'm so confused. l'm asking you,
please just leave me alone.

29:59.053 --> 30:01.521
-You believe in God, don't you?
-Yes.

30:01.773 --> 30:05.243
Then pray to God.
Ask him what he wants you to do.

30:05.493 --> 30:10.851
-Please, please just give me time.
-Do you still have my card?

30:12.013 --> 30:13.810
Yeah. lt's inside.

30:17.013 --> 30:22.007
l'll pray. l'll ask God what to do.

30:46.213 --> 30:48.283
What do you think, Mr. Kelly?

30:48.493 --> 30:51.053
The people running this
should be happy.

30:51.293 --> 30:53.807
We'll raise a half-million dollars.

30:54.053 --> 30:59.332
lt's how the rich persuade themselves
they're leading useful lives.

30:59.573 --> 31:02.610
My husband just got here, Mr. Kelly.

31:02.813 --> 31:08.604
There's Tom and Greg Sacca, one of his
assistants, who's bearding for him.

31:08.853 --> 31:12.812
The blond on Mr. Sacca's arm is my
husband's new mistress.

31:14.093 --> 31:20.089
-l'll pretend to go and powder my nose.
-Okay. l'll walk you to the door.

31:23.813 --> 31:24.848
LAURA:
Hi, Johnny.

31:25.893 --> 31:28.088
-Hey.
-Hi.

31:29.253 --> 31:32.211
-Big doings, huh?
-My firm took a table.

31:32.413 --> 31:36.406
-Was that Thomas Wagner's wife?
-l'm doing their security.

31:38.693 --> 31:43.448
-You look great.
-Thanks. You look very dashing.

31:45.373 --> 31:48.285
-How's the new job?
-lt's interesting.

31:49.573 --> 31:52.724
-l gotta take off. Talk to you later.
-See you.

31:52.973 --> 31:55.328
-Shall we take a little detour?
-Sure.

31:55.933 --> 31:57.810
l miss you.

31:59.173 --> 32:02.324
-Hello.
TOM: l was coming for you. Lovely gown.

32:02.533 --> 32:06.731
-Aren't you sweet. Remember Mr. Kelly?
-Of course.

32:06.933 --> 32:10.369
-Good evening, Greg.
-lt looks like a great event.

32:10.573 --> 32:12.245
Do you know Greta Weisner?

32:12.493 --> 32:14.563
Hello. l'm Susan, Tom's wife.

32:14.773 --> 32:15.762
How do you do?

32:15.973 --> 32:19.682
You're enjoying the company
of Greg and Greta so much. . .

32:19.893 --> 32:23.169
-. . .why don't they join us?
-Let's just leave it.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.369
We'll get acquainted later.

32:25.813 --> 32:29.488
l hope this doesn't make for
awkwardness with my husband.

32:29.693 --> 32:31.046
What do you mean?

32:31.253 --> 32:34.404
-Guilt pangs while you're screwing him.
-Susan--

32:34.613 --> 32:37.252
Maybe you're not bothered. He isn't.

32:37.453 --> 32:38.602
That's enough.

32:40.213 --> 32:44.809
l think you're right. l think,
actually, l will call it a night.

32:45.013 --> 32:47.208
lf you'll let go of my arm.

32:49.653 --> 32:51.211
Mr. Kelly?

33:07.493 --> 33:11.042
Does that make your list of most
miserable evenings?

33:11.493 --> 33:14.212
Well, at least it
wasn't raining, right?

33:15.573 --> 33:19.043
l've become someone
who likes public embarrassment. . .

33:19.213 --> 33:21.966
. . .and telling strangers
personal problems.

33:22.493 --> 33:27.009
-l hear people's problems all the time.
-l expect you do.

33:27.213 --> 33:29.807
l hope you're not going to quit.

33:30.013 --> 33:33.323
No. You're safe, right?
We got through the shift.

33:37.293 --> 33:42.128
-l'm gonna get going.
-Thank you for taking care of me.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.210
-Night.
-Good night.

34:18.572 --> 34:20.210
Mrs. DiLeo?

34:26.373 --> 34:28.409
You want to talk to me?

34:30.612 --> 34:31.648
Hey.

34:40.092 --> 34:43.802
l'm gonna louse up your day
real good, Jamie.

34:48.652 --> 34:52.407
Your mother gave you up.

34:55.213 --> 34:59.206
l didn't do none of the violence.
l was the lookout.

34:59.413 --> 35:02.485
Jamie wanted to do that house
for four months.

35:02.773 --> 35:04.729
Your brother, Jamie?

35:04.973 --> 35:10.809
l'm standing outside in the back, and
he goes in through the basement.

35:11.053 --> 35:16.047
Then l started to hear
scuffling and so forth.

35:16.293 --> 35:19.012
We didn't expect that
woman to be home.

35:19.213 --> 35:21.568
-You go inside?
-l went in. . .

35:23.093 --> 35:29.487
. . .and this woman was resisting, and
Jamie's got his hands on her throat.

35:30.013 --> 35:33.130
He squeezed her throat
until she went out.

35:33.333 --> 35:36.723
She was out. Jamie went
upstairs to get the jewelry.

35:36.933 --> 35:41.802
-What did you do?
-l went back outside.

35:44.173 --> 35:48.928
But then in a couple minutes,
l started to hear more scuffling.

35:49.173 --> 35:51.323
So l went back in. . .

35:51.573 --> 35:56.647
. . .and she must have got up because
she was upstairs, where Jamie was.

35:57.693 --> 36:03.529
And he got this lamp cord and
wrapped it around her neck.

36:03.773 --> 36:08.051
-Finally she went down.
-When did her throat get cut?

36:08.293 --> 36:11.842
First he went to the drawers to
get the jewelry. . .

36:12.093 --> 36:14.402
. . .and then when he was going out. . .

36:14.653 --> 36:19.169
. . .he got this ring off her finger,
and that's when he cut her throat.

36:25.653 --> 36:27.405
Then what happened?

36:30.093 --> 36:33.881
Then we sold Peggy the jewelry
and then we copped.

36:36.893 --> 36:39.805
How much smack did you
get for the jewelry?

36:41.413 --> 36:43.802
Three dime bags.

36:44.213 --> 36:48.650
That was cool. That was enough,
you know. We could both get off.

36:52.813 --> 36:56.601
And l wouldn't let Jamie
sell that VCR. . .

37:00.213 --> 37:02.249
. . .because that--

37:02.973 --> 37:05.407
That belonged to my mother.

37:20.413 --> 37:24.201
FANCY: l'll do what l can on my end,
but l can't promise anything.

37:24.853 --> 37:25.888
ls he done?

37:26.093 --> 37:29.005
He signed a statement.
l'll call the D.A.

37:29.213 --> 37:32.603
-You did a good job.
-Andy moved the mother.

37:32.813 --> 37:33.848
Good.

37:34.493 --> 37:37.451
-Nice going. Like riding a bike, huh?
-Yeah.

37:37.773 --> 37:39.206
Hey, lieutenant.

37:39.893 --> 37:44.444
Look, l don't know if you heard me
yesterday, saying l was grateful.

37:44.693 --> 37:47.890
You met me halfway on this--
More than halfway.

37:48.173 --> 37:53.805
-This mean we're going out for ribs?
-No. l didn't mean anything personal.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.408
Just do a good job, Andy.

38:00.973 --> 38:04.124
-Detective. The one brother rolled?
-Yeah.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.051
Going back to Anticrime?

38:06.253 --> 38:10.804
-That's what they told me, yeah.
-Hey, l enjoyed working with you.

38:11.013 --> 38:13.607
Same here.
l felt like l learned a lot.

38:14.573 --> 38:17.485
-See you around.
-Flying James.

38:18.693 --> 38:22.527
l just wanted to let you know,
l'm getting my gun back.

38:22.733 --> 38:26.089
The permit board didn't share
your feelings about me.

38:26.293 --> 38:32.641
-That's why there's vanilla and chocolate.
-Maybe there's merit in what you said.

38:34.053 --> 38:37.489
That getting robbed and beaten
has upset me. lt has.

38:37.693 --> 38:41.322
But l'm still a human, who has
to function in the city.

38:41.533 --> 38:45.321
You wanna be smart?
Take your gun to the property room.

38:45.533 --> 38:48.650
-No.
-You know what? Wait. Give it to me.

38:48.853 --> 38:53.131
Give it to me. l'll hold on to it
until you sort stuff out.

38:53.373 --> 38:59.926
No. Thanks for the concern. l consider
you a friend. l hope you feel the same.

39:00.093 --> 39:01.208
l do.

39:01.413 --> 39:05.804
Because l haven't made that many
friends in New York.

39:14.493 --> 39:17.803
l'm a respectable person.
l'm a chef at the Seville.

39:18.013 --> 39:20.925
Respectable people get
caught with whores.

39:21.133 --> 39:23.852
CHEF: l'm a family man.
l don't want this out.

39:24.053 --> 39:28.012
-Should have thought about that before.
SlPOWlCZ: What's the charge?

39:28.253 --> 39:32.007
Solicitation, he was trying to
pick up a whore.

39:32.213 --> 39:34.443
Let me talk to him for a second.

39:34.693 --> 39:37.605
Hold off writing that up
for two seconds. Okay?

39:37.813 --> 39:39.610
-Sure.
-What's your name?

39:39.853 --> 39:41.923
-Frank Kennedy.
-Yeah, step here.

39:42.173 --> 39:44.733
l can't believe l let this happen.

39:44.973 --> 39:48.522
Sometimes we follow our
little captains into battle.

39:48.733 --> 39:52.009
You're a chef at the Hotel Seville?

39:52.213 --> 39:53.851
For the past 12 years.

39:54.053 --> 39:57.762
You would be involved in preparing
room-service meals?

39:57.973 --> 39:59.611
Yeah, that's what l do.

40:00.413 --> 40:03.849
Someone we arrested is
staying at the Seville.

40:04.053 --> 40:07.204
-The secret government witness guy?
-Correct.

40:07.413 --> 40:08.812
Mr. Lasagna.

40:09.013 --> 40:11.686
-Mr. Lasagna, eh?
-That's all he orders.

40:11.893 --> 40:14.885
-And you prepare the meal?
-Yeah.

40:15.093 --> 40:18.324
-l'm in a lot of trouble here.
-Not necessarily.

40:20.373 --> 40:22.603
MEDAVOY:
Hey, Luth, good dog. Hey, Andy.

40:22.813 --> 40:26.408
Medavoy, you want me to take
Luther for a stroll?

40:26.613 --> 40:30.765
That'd be great. l got a bunch
of calls to make on a robbery.

40:30.973 --> 40:34.807
-Yeah, give me his scooper there.
-Yeah. There you go.

40:35.013 --> 40:36.412
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

40:36.653 --> 40:42.603
Hey, no problem. All right, Luther.
Wanna lay a loaf?

40:46.813 --> 40:48.610
Right this way, sir.

40:53.293 --> 40:54.408
KELLY:
Thanks.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.931
Thanks for coming.
l know we're not scheduled.

40:59.293 --> 41:00.328
That's okay.

41:00.853 --> 41:06.052
l don't need your services. l have
no excuse for asking you to come.

41:06.253 --> 41:08.926
l wanted company, and you came to
mind.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.124
How'd you get the eye?

41:11.333 --> 41:14.609
My husband beat me up
after the festivities.

41:14.813 --> 41:18.567
l'm sure it made for better sex
afterward with Greta.

41:19.093 --> 41:24.008
This is a horrible way to live.
lt's not how l wanted my life to be.

41:24.213 --> 41:26.522
What about making some changes?

41:28.213 --> 41:29.612
l should--

41:30.893 --> 41:32.849
l should divorce him.

41:33.853 --> 41:35.923
My husband doesn't want that.

41:36.173 --> 41:39.722
l think he's found the
arrangement he's looking for.

41:39.973 --> 41:44.842
He has a mistress and the bimbos he
cheats on her with, and then. . .

41:45.093 --> 41:50.645
. . .he gets to beat up his well-born
and genteelly impoverished wife.

41:50.893 --> 41:55.205
He says that he's insulated his
assets. He says that if l file. . .

41:55.453 --> 41:59.128
. . .for divorce, he'll tie up
the process for five years.

41:59.293 --> 42:01.853
Meanwhile, l'll be penniless.

42:05.333 --> 42:07.563
l just feel. . . .

42:08.733 --> 42:15.127
l just feel so helpless.
And l feel trapped. . .

42:17.213 --> 42:21.206
. . .and ashamed and afraid,
and l wish he were dead.

42:26.173 --> 42:28.164
Am l under arrest?

42:29.733 --> 42:32.531
Wishes don't get you busted,
Mrs. Wagner.

42:32.773 --> 42:35.241
lt's more than a wish, Mr. Kelly.

42:35.493 --> 42:39.088
lf l could come home one night
and he'd been shot--

42:39.293 --> 42:42.569
We're getting into a bad area
now, Mrs. Wagner.

43:05.373 --> 43:07.841
-Look at this. Unbelievable.
-Relax.

43:08.053 --> 43:10.442
Maybe English isn't
your first language?

43:10.653 --> 43:15.090
This is my farewell visit. l wanna
apologize. You got a job to do.

43:15.293 --> 43:16.931
You put us in the middle.

43:17.093 --> 43:21.723

see it from your point of view.

GlARDELLA: ls that who l think it is?
-The situation's under control.

43:27.213 --> 43:31.252
There he is. l'll tell you, Sipowicz,
l'll miss you in D.C.

43:31.453 --> 43:34.092
Me too. That's why
l came to say goodbye.

are you eating, Big Mac and fries?

SlPOWlCZ: l'm a realist.
MARSHAL 2: Bring it in.

43:48.853 --> 43:52.243

relief guy. Just tell him what l said.

GlARDELLA: My God, this is crap!
Sipowicz! He poisoned me! Call 911 !

44:19.413 --> 44:20.971
The bastard poisoned me!

KELLY: Your father?

44:52.093 --> 44:54.323
Cleaning his gun.

He left me this letter

45:16.653 --> 45:22.842
"l don't want you to feel bad.
There's reasons this makes sense.

This way Mommy gets benefits, which
l don't feel it's right she'd lose.

45:27.973 --> 45:34.367
Because whatever else, that was still
me going through those doors 22 years.

you're a good person. . .
