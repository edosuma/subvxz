00:15.999 --> 00:17.998
Have you ever used a condom?

00:17.999 --> 00:19.998
Do you think I'm the
biggest whore you have in your

00:19.999 --> 00:21.998
- family?
- No, but you're the

00:21.999 --> 00:23.998
only one I can talk to about
this stuff.

00:23.999 --> 00:25.998
- Like, who puts it on?
- The guy should have

00:25.999 --> 00:28.998
enough manners to put his own
condom on his own.

00:28.999 --> 00:32.998
What's a reservoir tip?
What does that even mean?

00:32.999 --> 00:35.998
- Oh.
- There you go.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.998
Oh, my God.
Khloe, you got condom juice...

00:38.999 --> 00:40.998
I on your shirt.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.998
All over my shirt!
Does this stuff stain?

00:43.999 --> 00:46.998
I mean, it's lubrication.

00:46.999 --> 00:49.999
How am I gonna explain this?

01:06.999 --> 01:08.998
- Hi, guys.
- What is that drink?

01:08.999 --> 01:10.998
- 'Cause you had it last time.
- Avocado and milk...

01:10.999 --> 01:12.998
- All right, guys.
- And, like, two

01:12.999 --> 01:15.998
- little teaspoons of sugar.
- How many calories?

01:15.999 --> 01:17.998
I don't know.
I have it every morning.

01:17.999 --> 01:18.999
- It's like pudding.
- It looks healthy; you

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
had it last time.
It looks like pudding.

01:20.001 --> 01:21.998
Yeah. Khloe said it
was gross.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.998
- It looks like, um...
- Pea soup.

01:24.999 --> 01:27.998
So, this morning,

01:27.999 --> 01:30.998
Tara will give you a little bit
of a recap on the PR, just over

01:30.999 --> 01:32.998
the last month, and what's
coming up.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.998
So July is obviously a
really big month for Kardashian

01:34.999 --> 01:37.998
Kids, in particular.
We're launching in Australia,

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
Big W, and Khloe's coming out to
Australia.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.998
Second year in a row, kids.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.998
It's your turn next, miss.

01:43.999 --> 01:45.998
- It's your turn. That's it.
- I'll go, but I said

01:45.999 --> 01:47.998
I just have a lot of baggage I
have to bring.

01:47.999 --> 01:50.998
I have a breast-feeding baby.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.998
No kids and I still
cover the kids' department.

01:52.999 --> 01:56.998
I am gonna be going to
Australia by myself to launch

01:56.999 --> 01:59.998
Kardashian Kids.
It's gonna be intense.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.998
There's gonna be three
straight 12-hour interview days,

02:02.999 --> 02:04.998
- press junkets, meet and greets.
- It's gonna be

02:04.999 --> 02:06.998
really interactive.
We're gonna have a little

02:06.999 --> 02:08.998
photo booth set up with, like,
little props that they can use.

02:08.999 --> 02:11.998
So cute.
And I am picking up the slack

02:11.999 --> 02:13.998
for my sisters.
They have so much going on in

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
their personal lives, and
apparently I don't, so two

02:17.000 --> 02:20.998
- straight years, me in Australia.
- So this is the catering

02:20.999 --> 02:22.998
menu.
There's a couple options, so if

02:22.999 --> 02:24.998
you guys want to let us know
your thoughts?

02:24.999 --> 02:26.998
Khlo, do you want the
avocado or the cheeseburgers?

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
- Are you going to this?
- No.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.999
So why are you picking the food?

02:35.999 --> 02:37.998
What is that juice, Kylie?

02:37.999 --> 02:39.998
Erewhon.
And they're really good for you.

02:39.999 --> 02:41.998
I think this is giving
me life, 'cause I was, like,

02:41.999 --> 02:43.998
- about to faint.
- Had I known you guys

02:43.999 --> 02:46.998
were into the juice, we could've
joined a cooking class.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.998
What does that have to
do with anything?

02:48.999 --> 02:53.998
So I just went over my
house stuff, and...

02:53.999 --> 02:57.998
- guess who has to move out.
- Oh, my God.

02:57.999 --> 03:00.998
Kanye and I are in the
final stages of our construction

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
on our home...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.998
and they've advised us that
we should move out so that they

03:05.999 --> 03:07.998
can do our bedroom and our
bathrooms now.

03:07.999 --> 03:10.998
- Do you want a roommate?
- I would have to make a

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
run for it.
Sayonara!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.998
Maybe we could move into
Kylie's new place for, like, a

03:14.999 --> 03:16.998
- little bit?
- I would seriously stab

03:16.999 --> 03:18.998
- myself.
- Come on, Kylie.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.998
I would do it for you.
I'm gonna ask Kanye if he's into

03:21.999 --> 03:23.998
- that idea.
- Nobody is staying at

03:23.999 --> 03:26.998
- my house.
- I don't know why they're

03:26.999 --> 03:29.998
being so rude and dramatic.
Like, I'm pregnant, they should

03:29.999 --> 03:32.998
want to, like, cater to a
pregnant woman.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.998
Maybe I'll go to Europe

03:34.999 --> 03:37.999
for a month.
Pretend like I'm Parisian.

03:47.999 --> 03:50.998
Have you ever, in your
life, met a more annoying

03:50.999 --> 03:51.999
person?
Can you imagine what your life

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
would be like with six torturous
kids?

04:07.999 --> 04:10.998
- It's Mase!
- Can I go first?

04:10.999 --> 04:12.998
I want to put you
second, 'cause I was here first,

04:12.999 --> 04:14.998
- so I already put my name first.
- Okay.

04:14.999 --> 04:18.998
How do you erase something?

04:18.999 --> 04:22.998
- I hate this thing!
- Wait, but why are

04:22.999 --> 04:25.998
- we all on the same team?
- Why are you asking me

04:25.999 --> 04:28.998
- so many questions?
- I really want to go.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.998
We have to wait
till she enters in our names.

04:30.999 --> 04:33.998
- Almost... there we go!
- There we go!

04:33.999 --> 04:35.998
- We did it, Mase!
- Oh, yeah!

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
- Yeah!
- Who is supposed to

04:37.000 --> 04:39.998
- be "Kok"?
- "Cock"?

04:39.999 --> 04:42.998
"Kokes." But we...

04:42.999 --> 04:46.998
It just says K-O-K.
No bueno.

04:46.999 --> 04:52.998
Good luck, Mase.
Yeah!

04:52.999 --> 04:54.998
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

04:54.999 --> 04:56.998
- Good job!
- Good job.

04:56.999 --> 04:58.998
When is Scott coming back?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.998
Is he gonna be back before
Saturday?

05:00.999 --> 05:04.998
- Um, yes.
- He's in Europe?

05:04.999 --> 05:06.998
Mm-hmm.
- Even though Scott and

05:06.999 --> 05:09.999
Kourtney are broken up, I'm
really worried he's gonna do

05:10.000 --> 05:12.998
whatever he can to get back with
Kourtney.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.998
What's going on with him?

05:14.999 --> 05:16.998
- Mm, nothing.
- You know, I really think

05:16.999 --> 05:19.998
that Kourtney's had it, so I
don't think that she would...

05:19.999 --> 05:22.999
necessarily get back with him,
but there's always that

05:23.000 --> 05:25.998
possibility and that just
worries me, 'cause he can't just

05:25.999 --> 05:28.998
go, do what he wants to do and
then come back when he wants to

05:28.999 --> 05:30.998
come back.
I hope that she just holds her

05:30.999 --> 05:33.998
ground, 'cause it's not gonna
help anyone.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.998
- Down the middle, Mase!
- I think my stomach

05:36.999 --> 05:38.998
- popped yesterday.
- Are your jeans

05:38.999 --> 05:39.999
- buttoned?
- Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.998
Are you wearing
maternity jeans now?

05:41.999 --> 05:43.998
- No.
- I think it's time

05:43.999 --> 05:46.998
to start.
Mase!

05:46.999 --> 05:47.999
Oh, my gosh, you did it!

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
Uh-huh!

05:59.999 --> 06:01.998
Who are you

06:01.999 --> 06:04.998
- FaceTiming?
- Bruiser.

06:04.999 --> 06:07.998
Hi, there!
There you are!

06:07.999 --> 06:09.998
Why won't you respond
to my text messages?

06:09.999 --> 06:12.998
- Are you mad at me?
- Huh?

06:12.999 --> 06:14.998
Why won't you respond
to my text...

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
Now, hold on a second.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.998
I thought I did... I didn't see
something.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.998
I'm gonna look and I will
respond.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.998
I get so insecure when
you don't respond to me.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.998
I think, like, you're mad, and I
didn't even do anything.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.998
I sincerely apologize.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.998
- Okay.
- Hi, gorgeous!

06:28.999 --> 06:30.998
- Hi!
- You look super cute.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
Ooh, so do you.
Look at the cutest one of them

06:33.000 --> 06:35.998
- all.
- Is that Kourtney?

06:35.999 --> 06:37.998
- Yep.
- Oh, I can do that,

06:37.999 --> 06:39.998
- too.
- I know.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.998
All right, I will

06:41.999 --> 06:43.998
- check for your text.
- Okay.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.998
Good-bye.
I love you.

06:45.999 --> 06:46.999
- Bye, love you.
- Bye, Kourt. Bye.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.998
Bye.
Love you, bye.

06:49.999 --> 06:52.998
- Bye!
- Aw, I love everyone.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.998
So I'm going to Australia on

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
- Monday.
- Monday?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.998
Mm-hmm.
And I was thinking, we don't

07:00.999 --> 07:03.998
want to, like, throw off our
whole workout routine, right?

07:03.999 --> 07:05.998
- Yeah.
- I was thinking you

07:05.999 --> 07:08.998
should come to Australia with
me and be my workout buddy.

07:08.999 --> 07:12.998
- Um...
- You don't want to go?

07:12.999 --> 07:15.998
I don't know.
I was thinking about it for a

07:15.999 --> 07:19.998
second, and then...
I just feel like I need to stay

07:19.999 --> 07:22.998
home.
I know that Khloe really wants

07:22.999 --> 07:26.998
me to go to Australia with her,
but I really don't want to go

07:26.999 --> 07:29.998
without my kids.
They need me now more than ever,

07:29.999 --> 07:34.998
and to leave for a week would
just be irresponsible.

07:34.999 --> 07:37.998
This whole event is to
launch, like, Kardashian Kids in

07:37.999 --> 07:42.998
Australia, so I think having
three little munchkins probably

07:42.999 --> 07:44.998
is a great, like, walking...

07:44.999 --> 07:47.998
- bonus.
- Um... I just don't

07:47.999 --> 07:55.999
want people to ask me annoying
questions.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.998
Do you know Caitlyn
told me that how you get a

08:02.999 --> 08:06.998
- penis, they make it your clit?
- Why are you having

08:06.999 --> 08:09.998
- these conversations with her?
- What do you mean?

08:09.999 --> 08:14.998
It's so weird.
So they get rid of the penis and

08:14.999 --> 08:16.998
leave just a little bit of it?

08:16.999 --> 08:18.999
- There you are!
- You have to hold this.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.998
- Hey, gorg!
- Hi, gorgeous!

08:21.999 --> 08:23.998
- What's up?
- I wanted to remember,

08:23.999 --> 08:26.999
- how do make a on a girl?
- Oh, my God.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.998
I was trying to tell

08:28.999 --> 08:31.998
Malika.
You told me, on a girl, to

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
transition, is they use the
clit, right?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.998
- Yes.
- But you still keep,

08:36.999 --> 08:40.998
like, the hole, I guess?

08:40.999 --> 08:42.998
I think they close it.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.998
You told me they kept it.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.998
Why would you have the best of
both worlds? That's unfair.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.998
You're not thinking

08:48.999 --> 08:50.998
- of getting one, are you?
- I have a pretty big

08:50.999 --> 08:52.998
set of balls already, so, you
know.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.998
Okay. Love you!

08:55.999 --> 08:57.998
Oh, that's too much
for you? Really?

08:57.999 --> 08:59.998
It's about all I can handle.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.998
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

09:01.999 --> 09:04.998
- I can't.
- Hazardous driving

09:04.999 --> 09:07.998
conditions on the U.S. 101
southbound.

09:07.999 --> 09:08.999
- Okay, bitch.
- All right.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.998
Shut up. No.
Are you excited to go to

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
- Australia?
- I am.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.999
I actually like the flight
though.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.999
Yeah, you get to sleep
the whole time.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.998
- I know.
- Everyone keeps asking,

09:19.999 --> 09:21.998
like, why doesn't Kourt go?
All this stuff.

09:21.999 --> 09:24.998
You know, she's just overwhelmed
and blah, blah, blah with

09:24.999 --> 09:27.998
everything, and I totally get
it.

09:27.999 --> 09:30.998
Kim and Kourtney have
both been very busy on the

09:30.999 --> 09:33.998
baby-making front.
And unfortunately, that has

09:33.999 --> 09:37.998
really changed the circumstances
for who travels to work and who

09:37.999 --> 09:39.998
doesn't.
And I think Khloe's a real

09:39.999 --> 09:41.998
trouper when it comes to holding
it down for her sisters on the

09:41.999 --> 09:43.998
- work front.
- We're gonna be there

09:43.999 --> 09:45.998
- for a week.
- It's crazy, 'cause it

09:45.999 --> 09:48.998
doesn't seem like it's gonna be
a week, but it...

09:48.999 --> 09:51.998
'Cause it's really, like, one
day travel there and then one

09:51.999 --> 09:55.998
- day travel back, right?
- I don't know.

09:55.999 --> 09:57.998
Head south on
Sepulveda Boulevard.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.998
Listen, bitch, on my
old car, no one ever spoke to

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
me!
Stop talking to me, or we're

10:01.000 --> 10:03.998
getting a new car.
You're short.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.998
You're, like, just an
inconvenience, you dumb

10:05.999 --> 10:13.999
whore!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.999
This looks so crazy.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.998
It makes it, like, a flakey
croissant pancake thing.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.998
Do you really want the avocado
thing?

10:22.999 --> 10:25.998
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

10:25.999 --> 10:28.998
- This is so good.
- You drink it or you eat

10:28.999 --> 10:30.998
- it with a spoon?
- I eat it with a

10:30.999 --> 10:34.998
spoon.
You kind of have to, like, get

10:34.999 --> 10:38.998
- used to it though.
- This is, like, warm.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.998
I like it like
that, but that's how I'm used to

10:40.999 --> 10:42.998
eating it, but we could put it
in the fridge for a while, and

10:42.999 --> 10:46.998
- you can have it later.
- No, I mean, it's really

10:46.999 --> 10:50.998
good.
So what's going on...

10:50.999 --> 10:53.998
with Scott?
Do you have, like, a plan, like,

10:53.999 --> 10:57.998
with the kids or anything?
Or is it just, like, whenever?

10:57.999 --> 11:00.998
I just want to keep
it, like, as normal for them as

11:00.999 --> 11:02.998
- possible.
Mm-hmm.

11:02.999 --> 11:07.998
But, like, I just
know that the way things...

11:07.999 --> 11:11.998
were, if he just, like, moved
back here, it would just be the

11:11.999 --> 11:13.998
- same.
- I feel like he had fun,

11:13.999 --> 11:17.998
and then once, like, reality set
in, he was like, "Oh,."

11:17.999 --> 11:19.998
Yeah, but I feel
like that's kind of what happens

11:19.999 --> 11:21.998
every time.
Like, he would be home and be

11:21.999 --> 11:25.998
really good for, like, three
months, and then go out of town,

11:25.999 --> 11:29.998
and then be, like, worse than he
was, you know, before.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.998
Like, each time, it
would get worse and worse.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.998
- And so...
- And you don't have time

11:33.999 --> 11:36.998
- for that.
- No.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.998
He has, like, two personalities.
That's the hard thing.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.998
It's like he wants both.
He's like, "I just want my

11:42.999 --> 11:45.998
family," or whatever, and I'm
just like, "Well, what are you

11:45.999 --> 11:49.998
doing to try to change your
life?"

11:49.999 --> 11:51.998
There's just a lot that would
have to happen...

11:51.999 --> 11:53.998
Mm-hmm.
- for him to,

11:53.999 --> 11:56.998
- like, get on a good path.
- Yeah, and it would

11:56.999 --> 12:00.998
definitely be a process.
Do you think you would ever,

12:00.999 --> 12:02.998
like, forgive him and get back
with him?

12:02.999 --> 12:04.998
- Me?
Mm-hmm.

12:04.999 --> 12:08.998
Um...
I feel like right now...

12:08.999 --> 12:11.998
- Hey, Scott.
- I'm trying to find the

12:11.999 --> 12:13.998
- keys to my car.
- I am, like, in shock.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.998
I haven't seen him in so long.
He obviously spent the night,

12:17.999 --> 12:20.998
and Kourtney didn't mention that
he was there.

12:20.999 --> 12:23.998
- Wait, a Range Rover key?
- Yeah, do you have it?

12:23.999 --> 12:25.998
I saw it right there.
If-if it's yours.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.998
I've never heard so
much noise in one house.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.998
I thought Kourtney was,
like, really strong and firm,

12:30.999 --> 12:32.998
and now, like, are they back
together?

12:32.999 --> 12:34.998
What is he...?
Like, I just don't understand.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
Is that it?

12:40.999 --> 12:42.998
Scott.
It's interesting to me that

12:42.999 --> 12:45.998
Scott is texting me now.
"I really want to talk to you

12:45.999 --> 12:50.998
about everything when you can."
I love going to these places.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.998
I don't mind the work.
But you guys all have families

12:53.999 --> 12:55.998
and kids.
I have no friends anymore,

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
because I've done too many jobs.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.998
- Hey, Scott.
- I'm trying to find the

13:05.999 --> 13:08.998
- keys to my car.
- I've never heard so much

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
noise in one house.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.998
Kourt, do you know where this
key went?

13:15.999 --> 13:18.998
Um, no.
Is it in the car maybe?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.998
- No, it was outside.
- Hmm?

13:20.999 --> 13:23.998
It was outside the
car, and now it's...

13:23.999 --> 13:26.998
That scaffolding noise is
insane, by the way.

13:26.999 --> 13:32.998
They're putting up the mirrors.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.998
Wait, do you think he heard me?

13:34.999 --> 13:36.998
- No.
- Why was he...?

13:36.999 --> 13:40.999
I didn't know he was here.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.998
What if he thinks I was, like,
talking about him?

13:43.999 --> 13:51.999
- No, he doesn't.
- That was so awkward.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.998
Ooh, hello.
Are we going to, like, a green

14:03.999 --> 14:04.999
- room real quick?
- Yes, we are.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.998
- Okay.
- And then we'll go into

14:06.999 --> 14:08.998
- the event.
- Perfect.

14:08.999 --> 14:11.998
I want to introduce
you all to Khloe Kardashian.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.998
Over to you.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.998
Thank you.
I just wanted to say thank you,

14:15.999 --> 14:19.998
guys, so much for coming here
today and celebrating with us

14:19.999 --> 14:22.998
our launch for Kardashian Kids.
My sisters are sorry they

14:22.999 --> 14:24.998
couldn't be here.
It's always an excuse.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.998
One has a baby, and one's
pregnant, so...

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
it's me, I'm here!

14:29.000 --> 14:32.998
I just landed in Australia, and

14:32.999 --> 14:35.998
all I know is that I hit the
ground running and I'm gonna be

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
working for three straight days.
Nice to see you.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.999
Hi.
Jet lag is slowly kicking in,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.998
but personally I'm so grateful
for everyone that's here,

14:47.999 --> 14:50.998
appreciating and accepting our
line and wanting it and just

14:50.999 --> 14:52.998
really being so excited about it
that it gives me the second

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
wind.
Kardashian Kids is now available

14:55.000 --> 14:57.998
in stores and online only at the
Big W.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.998
Great, doing great, Khloe.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.998
Mm-hmm.
Hi. How are you?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.998
- Oh, my goodness.
- What was the

15:04.999 --> 15:06.998
- competition?
- I had to write in 25

15:06.999 --> 15:08.998
words where would I take you in
Australia.

15:08.999 --> 15:10.998
- Where?
- I said, "I'll take you

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
to cuddle a koala..."
Yes.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.998
"...and cackle with a
kookaburra."

15:13.999 --> 15:16.998
Do you know that
koalas have chlamydia?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.998
I have been to the zoo here, and
I was like, "Oh, my God, we're

15:18.999 --> 15:20.998
gonna hold koalas," and they
said, "You can't, 'cause they

15:20.999 --> 15:22.998
have chlamydia."
It's like, " off, they

15:22.999 --> 15:25.998
- don't have an STD," but they do.
- It's... they're gross.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
Nasty little animals.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.998
What is this salad?
It smells so good.

15:36.999 --> 15:41.998
Avocado and beans and
chicken and tomato and cheese.

15:41.999 --> 15:45.998
So, in two weeks are you looking
forward to getting new

15:45.999 --> 15:48.998
- roommates?
- New roommates?

15:48.999 --> 15:51.998
Yes.
Me, Kanye, North.

15:51.999 --> 15:55.998
- Just three.
- Are you kidding?

15:55.999 --> 15:58.998
The last time Kim told me she
was moving in for a couple of

15:58.999 --> 16:02.998
months, it stretched into almost
two years.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.998
She completely took over my
whole house.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.998
This one has a lock on it.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.998
Well, who's got the key?

16:08.999 --> 16:10.998
I do. Why would you have
the key to my diamonds?

16:10.999 --> 16:13.998
This is my closet.
I'm thinking to myself, "Oh,

16:13.999 --> 16:16.998
here we go again."
You know what people ask me?

16:16.999 --> 16:19.998
"Are you sad that your kids have
all left the nest?"

16:19.999 --> 16:23.998
And I said, "I'll let
you know if they ever leave."

16:23.999 --> 16:27.998
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but fine.

16:27.999 --> 16:30.998
This time, it's only
till December 1...

16:30.999 --> 16:32.998
You're staying for six months?!

16:32.999 --> 16:34.998
It's not six months,

16:34.999 --> 16:36.998
- Mom.
- Oh, my God.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.998
- It's five months.
- It'll never be five

16:38.999 --> 16:40.998
- months.
- It is, Mom, it is,

16:40.999 --> 16:41.999
because I'm having the baby, and
I cannot...

16:42.000 --> 16:43.998
That's what you said
the last time, and you gave

16:43.999 --> 16:51.999
birth at my house!
Help me!

16:54.999 --> 16:58.998
- It's only 5:50.
- For us, it's

16:58.999 --> 17:01.998
actually, like, 1:00 a.m.
You've had a very, very long

17:01.999 --> 17:03.998
- day.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17:03.999 --> 17:06.998
Uh-huh.

17:06.999 --> 17:11.998
On a.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.998
Either you're funny
or I'm really delirious.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.999
I think you're just
really... 'cause I don't think

17:16.000 --> 17:17.999
I'm that funny.
I don't really know what's

17:18.000 --> 17:20.998
- happening.
- Your random spurts

17:20.999 --> 17:22.998
of, like, um...
What do they call it?

17:22.999 --> 17:24.998
What's that disease called when
people, like...?

17:24.999 --> 17:26.998
- Tourette's?
- Yes.

17:26.999 --> 17:28.998
You have randy... random spurts
of Tourette's.

17:28.999 --> 17:32.998
- Randy?
- Randy!

17:32.999 --> 17:35.998
Scott.
"Wow, I can't believe I've been

17:35.999 --> 17:37.998
writing your old number.
Kourtney's told me about this

17:37.999 --> 17:40.998
new number, and now I see we
actually did text.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
I'm sure I was not in the right
frame of mind.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.998
I really want to talk to you
about everything when you can."

17:45.999 --> 17:49.998
I haven't spoken to Scott in
about a month, and it's

17:49.999 --> 17:52.998
interesting to me that he's
texting me now.

17:52.999 --> 17:55.998
I mean, my last text from him is
me reaching out to him, and then

17:55.999 --> 17:58.998
it just goes dead for about
a month.

17:58.999 --> 18:02.998
Kourtney, do you want me to talk
to him?

18:02.999 --> 18:05.998
I don't feel comfortable
responding to him until I talk

18:05.999 --> 18:08.998
to Kourtney and see what she
wants me to say.

18:08.999 --> 18:10.998
You have to reward
some good behavior.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.998
I haven't seen good
behavior yet, 'cause he wants to

18:12.999 --> 18:15.998
- talk.
- No, I know.

18:15.999 --> 18:19.998
But in, you know, taking
responsibility for not trying to

18:19.999 --> 18:22.998
communicate?
At least it's the truth.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
Yeah.

18:34.999 --> 18:36.998
It's been a long time

18:36.999 --> 18:39.998
- since I've been here.
- Ooh, they have pad Thai.

18:39.999 --> 18:40.999
- Thank you.
- Do you want to order,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.998
Mom?
Thank you.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
- Sure.
- Can I get the Dim Sum

18:44.000 --> 18:45.998
- and Then Some?
- Yeah.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.998
And I'll get the Chinese
chicken salad, and then I'll get

18:48.999 --> 18:52.998
the pad Thai, and then the
chicken pot stickers...

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
- Okay.
- And then shrimp fried

18:54.000 --> 18:56.998
- rice.
- If I start eating like

18:56.999 --> 18:59.998
you, I'm gonna look like I'm
pregnant.

18:59.999 --> 19:02.998
So I've been, like,
acting a little bit more

19:02.999 --> 19:05.998
interested in Kourtney's whole,
like, organic pregnancy stuff,

19:05.999 --> 19:07.998
just so I can kind of, like,
keep an eye on her.

19:07.999 --> 19:09.998
- That's a good idea.
- Just to make sure she's

19:09.999 --> 19:11.998
- okay, you know?
Mm-hmm.

19:11.999 --> 19:14.998
But then the other day,
I was there and I was talking to

19:14.999 --> 19:16.998
Kourtney about Scott, and I was
like, "So what are you gonna do?

19:16.999 --> 19:18.998
What are the rules gonna be?
What are this, what are that?"

19:18.999 --> 19:22.998
and then he just walks out,
like, of the other room.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.998
- He was there?
- Yeah.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.998
He was fully there.
It was clear he spent the night.

19:27.999 --> 19:29.998
- No.
- And I was like... it was

19:29.999 --> 19:32.998
- so awkward.
- Well, I learned the

19:32.999 --> 19:35.998
hard way, because I've been
through being divorced,

19:35.999 --> 19:38.998
basically, when I had little
kids.

19:38.999 --> 19:40.998
And you have to put the kids
first.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
- You just have to...
- She does.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.998
- No, she totally does.
- Yeah, but I mean, it

19:43.999 --> 19:46.998
can't be about her and it can't
be about him, and I think she's

19:46.999 --> 19:48.998
handling it really well.
I think they just have to really

19:48.999 --> 19:54.998
focus on... making sure the kids
don't feel... you know,

19:54.999 --> 19:58.998
- abandoned by anybody.
- You know, I think

19:58.999 --> 20:00.998
regardless of Scott and Kourtney
being together, Scott will

20:00.999 --> 20:03.998
always be in our lives.
I mean, he's the father of my

20:03.999 --> 20:06.998
nephews and my niece.
We want him healthy and happy,

20:06.999 --> 20:10.998
so that he can be in their lives
as much as possible.

20:10.999 --> 20:14.998
But I still want Kourtney to
figure it out and be strong and

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
not get back together with him.

20:18.999 --> 20:21.998
- Hi. What's going on?
- Just organizing.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.998
There's racks of
clothes and shoes.

20:24.999 --> 20:28.998
She is going to have every
corner of my house.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.998
Well, I hope you remember, when
I'm 85 years old...

20:30.999 --> 20:32.998
I didn't take over your
whole house.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.998
And I'm senile and I
have nowhere to live.

20:35.999 --> 20:37.998
Didn't Kimberly just
go to Paris?

20:37.999 --> 20:39.998
Mm-hmm.
But she can't come here to do

20:39.999 --> 20:41.998
- this.
- Khloe puts herself on

20:41.999 --> 20:43.998
the back burner.
I think it's unfair she has to

20:43.999 --> 20:45.998
do things alone.
You're more exhausted than you

20:45.999 --> 20:47.998
normally would be because
you're doing all this by

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
- yourself.
- I'm normally doing

20:49.000 --> 20:50.999
this by myself.

20:58.999 --> 21:02.998
This rack is my mom's.
I'm not this unorganized.

21:02.999 --> 21:06.998
We should maybe move them, so
that my mom has as much room for

21:06.999 --> 21:11.998
- all of her stuff as possible.
- Hi. What's going on?

21:11.999 --> 21:15.998
Just organizing my stuff.

21:15.999 --> 21:18.998
Why is it all in the garage?

21:18.999 --> 21:21.998
Because you don't use
this garage, and I thought that

21:21.999 --> 21:24.998
I would not take up an extra
bedroom, and I would just have

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
all my stuff right here.

21:28.999 --> 21:32.998
Oh, my goodness.
The takeover has begun.

21:32.999 --> 21:37.998
There's racks of clothes and
shoes and bags.

21:37.999 --> 21:41.998
She is going to have every
corner of my house.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.998
Well, I hope you remember all of
this and how you took over my

21:44.999 --> 21:46.998
entire house, when I'm 85 years
old...

21:46.999 --> 21:48.998
I didn't take over your
whole house.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.998
And I'm senile and I
have nowhere to live.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.998
Wow.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
What did I get myself into?

21:59.999 --> 22:01.998
How you feeling?
You okay?

22:01.999 --> 22:03.998
Yeah, I just don't like rushing.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.998
You need to recheck your...

22:05.999 --> 22:08.998
My vagina?
My camel toe?

22:08.999 --> 22:12.998
Listen, a girl's got a puffy
, remember that.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.998
It's a good opener.
It's an icebreaker.

22:14.999 --> 22:18.998
Today is a major press
junket day.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.998
I have about 60-something
different media outlets that I'm

22:20.999 --> 22:22.998
- meeting with.
- Khloe, welcome

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
- back to Sydney.
- Thank you.

22:23.999 --> 22:24.999
It's great to have you here.

22:24.999 --> 22:25.999
Thank you.
I love being here.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.998
Before we get
started, just want to say, I

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
- shoot.
- Thank you.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.998
It was terrifying, but a lot of
fun to do. Yeah.

22:32.999 --> 22:35.998
Doing these by myself, picking
up the slack for my sisters, I

22:35.999 --> 22:38.998
mean, it's intense, but you just
got to plaster a smile on your

22:38.999 --> 22:41.998
face, ignore the jet lag and
keep it pushin'.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.998
Can I get you anything?

22:43.999 --> 22:46.998
- I'm good.
- Hi, Khloe.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.998
Thank you so much for meeting
with us.

22:48.999 --> 22:49.999
- You.
- What's the

22:50.000 --> 22:51.998
best thing about working with
your sisters?

22:51.999 --> 22:53.998
It's crazy, 'cause
they say you should never work

22:53.999 --> 22:55.998
with family, but I would not
know how to work with anybody

22:55.999 --> 22:57.998
else.
We trust each other.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.998
Like, Kourtney is breast-feeding
and can't travel with all of her

23:00.999 --> 23:03.998
kids, and Kim's pregnant, so
they of course trust me to be

23:03.999 --> 23:05.998
here.
It's a big responsibility.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.998
It is.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.998
- Two more and then lunch.
- Okay.

23:09.999 --> 23:11.998
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.998
- You're almost done.
- Yay!

23:13.999 --> 23:15.998
- You're such a sport.
- Oh, Malika.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.998
Khloe is a people pleaser.

23:17.999 --> 23:18.999
She'll do anything to please her
sisters.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.998
But I think the workload's a
little excessive, and it's only

23:22.999 --> 23:25.998
set up this way because it's
intended to be spread across

23:25.999 --> 23:27.998
- three people.
- What's been

23:27.999 --> 23:30.998
- your favorite look of 2015?
- I don't know, 'cause I

23:30.999 --> 23:33.998
can't think about anything.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
This is when I wish one of my
sisters were here, 'cause we

23:35.000 --> 23:36.998
always, like, answer for each
other.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.998
Amazing.
That's me.

23:38.999 --> 23:41.998
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm, something smells

23:41.999 --> 23:47.998
good.
Hey there, hi there, ho there.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.998
So what was your favorite part
about today's interviews?

23:50.999 --> 23:52.998
I don't know, Malika.
Just, like, repetitive.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.998
I'm like, can we just all sit in
one room, guys?

23:54.999 --> 23:56.998
So many people today though.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.998
So many people.
But I'm like, I don't even know

23:58.999 --> 24:00.998
what we're talking about
anymore.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.998
You're more exhausted
than you normally would be,

24:02.999 --> 24:04.998
because you're doing all of this
by yourself.

24:04.999 --> 24:07.998
I'm normally doing
this by myself.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.998
Khloe, over and over
again, pretty much puts herself

24:09.999 --> 24:12.998
on the back burner when it comes
to work with her sisters.

24:12.999 --> 24:16.998
And I think it's unfair that she
has to do things alone.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.998
She needs to put herself as a
priority, and she can't do that

24:19.999 --> 24:22.998
unless she has help from them.
Didn't Kimberly just go to

24:22.999 --> 24:24.998
- Paris?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.998
But she can't come here to do
this.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.998
Do you want them to come
with you?

24:28.999 --> 24:31.998
Of course she does,
but she's, like, a super sister.

24:31.999 --> 24:33.998
I do all the work and
we split all the money.

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
What if you just said no?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.998
What if you were just like, "You
know what? I can't make it."

24:37.999 --> 24:40.998
Have you ever even said
anything?

24:40.999 --> 24:42.998
Just saying, "You know what, you
guys?

24:42.999 --> 24:44.998
I've pulled up for you now.
I'm just hoping that when it's

24:44.999 --> 24:47.998
my turn, you guys will do it for
me."

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
You talk to them, Malika.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.998
I'd be happy to, but
I think it would be better to

24:50.999 --> 24:53.998
come from you.
I love you to pieces.

24:53.999 --> 24:56.999
You should talk to your sisters.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.998
Kim, were these
your gold things?

25:06.999 --> 25:09.998
No.
The same ones though.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.998
So, of course that means she
took the whole thing, what I was

25:12.999 --> 25:16.998
doing, which I don't mind, but
ask me for my marble.

25:16.999 --> 25:21.998
Hmm.
How long are you staying here?

25:21.999 --> 25:24.998
Till probably, like,
the first week of December.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
What?
I thought you were here for,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.999
- like, a week.
- No, I'm here till

25:29.000 --> 25:31.998
December.
What was Scott doing at the

25:31.999 --> 25:34.998
- house the other day?
- He said he wanted

25:34.999 --> 25:37.998
to check into a rehab and they
didn't have, like, a private

25:37.999 --> 25:40.998
- room until that day.
- But he's out at the

25:40.999 --> 25:42.998
- club last night, partying?
- So he was like, "Do

25:42.999 --> 25:45.998
you mind if I stay there?
I'll stay down in the guest

25:45.999 --> 25:47.998
room.
Just 'cause I can't be in my

25:47.999 --> 25:50.998
house alone; it's, like, not
good for me."

25:50.999 --> 25:55.998
And so then he was at the house,
and I just so saw how his brain

25:55.999 --> 25:59.998
works, for the first time.
Like, he just, like, convinces

25:59.999 --> 26:03.998
himself of why he needs to go
out.

26:03.999 --> 26:07.998
He, like... to make himself feel
okay, he makes the excuse me.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.998
- You know?
- Yeah. That's so wrong.

26:09.999 --> 26:12.998
Like, he's like,
"I want to kill myself from

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
being in this room."

26:16.999 --> 26:21.998
But it was just... it made it so
clear that no matter what I do,

26:21.999 --> 26:25.998
or don't do, like, he uses...
he'll make anything into an

26:25.999 --> 26:28.998
excuse.
And I just don't need that

26:28.999 --> 26:32.998
- around us right now.
- I feel really relieved

26:32.999 --> 26:35.999
that Kourtney doesn't want that
toxic part of their relationship

26:36.000 --> 26:39.998
in her life anymore.
Right now, she's really strong

26:39.999 --> 26:41.998
and in a good place and she's
realized that she will be better

26:41.999 --> 26:45.998
- off and happier this way.
- All, like, the

26:45.999 --> 26:49.998
help and protecting we try to do
for these guys, like, it's just

26:49.999 --> 26:56.999
- not helpful. You know?
- Yeah, totally.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.998
It's such a fabulous
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
Up the bum, no babies!

27:02.000 --> 27:06.998
Up the bum, no babies!
Yeah!

27:06.999 --> 27:09.998
The whole thing was an
open-door policy, and now I go,

27:09.999 --> 27:11.998
and she's like, "Don't let him
in the house."

27:11.999 --> 27:19.999
I feel like I'm missing
a piece of the story.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.998
- Hi.
- I'm Teresa.

27:27.999 --> 27:29.998
- So nice to meet you.
- Khloe. Nice to meet

27:29.999 --> 27:31.998
you.
Can he take a picture with you

27:31.999 --> 27:33.998
guys?
We've had such a crazy trip.

27:33.999 --> 27:37.998
So much work.
I am fully exhausted right now,

27:37.999 --> 27:42.998
but Malika found this drag show,
and I feel like I owe it to her

27:42.999 --> 27:45.998
- to let loose and have fun.
- Want to do a shot?

27:45.999 --> 27:47.998
- Yeah.
- We are going to do

27:47.999 --> 27:49.998
- shots with Khloe.
- Wet!

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
Wet?
I don't know what that is!

27:55.999 --> 27:58.998
Do I have a wet?

27:58.999 --> 28:02.998
Up the bum, no babies!

28:02.999 --> 28:04.998
Up the bum, no babies!
Yes!

28:04.999 --> 28:09.999
Khloe, yes!

28:11.999 --> 28:13.998
Welcome to Stonewall

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
Hotel.
It's such a fabulous evening.

28:24.999 --> 28:26.998
Thank you guys so much.

28:26.999 --> 28:29.998
This was the best part of my
trip!

28:29.999 --> 28:32.998
I am having the best time.

28:32.999 --> 28:35.998
Shots, drag queens.
Like, it's just super-fun.

28:35.999 --> 28:38.998
And I think I need this
sometimes for my soul.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.998
I mean, honestly, that

28:41.999 --> 28:43.998
was the funnest thing we'll ever
do.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.998
Malika had a really good point.

28:45.999 --> 28:49.998
I'm the last one to take time
for myself or take time off

28:49.999 --> 28:52.998
work, but I'm so happy Malika
made me.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.998
Now I get these memories of
being in Australia, going to a

28:55.999 --> 28:57.998
drag show, and having the best
time.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.998
- Oh, I love you.
- Thank you.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.998
It's 5:02, you guys,

29:01.999 --> 29:04.999
- and we are...
- Turnt up!

29:13.000 --> 29:15.998
- Do you have mascara?
- Really, Kim?

29:15.999 --> 29:18.998
What, 'cause I'm using
your mascara?

29:18.999 --> 29:22.998
Get a life.
I have these videos on my phone

29:22.999 --> 29:26.998
of Mason teaching North how to
ballroom dance, and he put on a

29:26.999 --> 29:28.998
prince costume, and he made
North wear a crown.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.998
- It was so funny.
- Have you talked to

29:31.999 --> 29:33.998
- Kourtney?
- I mean, I do.

29:33.999 --> 29:36.998
She just seems like it's, like,
frustrating, but she's gonna get

29:36.999 --> 29:38.998
through.
I think she knows, like, what

29:38.999 --> 29:41.998
- can she do with Scott, you know?
- Well, I just feel like,

29:41.999 --> 29:44.998
I mean, for me, I'm trying to be
there for her, but in ways...

29:44.999 --> 29:46.998
Like, she calls me, like, right
before the weekend, and she

29:46.999 --> 29:48.998
- says, you know...
- She doesn't have a nanny

29:48.999 --> 29:50.998
- on the weekends.
- I know, so she said,

29:50.999 --> 29:52.998
"Can you babysit Saturday?"
And I'm like, "Oopsy, photo

29:52.999 --> 29:54.998
shoot."
I mean, Corey will help her.

29:54.999 --> 29:58.998
So she was like, "Okay."
And I just feel like the only

29:58.999 --> 30:01.998
thing I know to do is just to be
there...

30:01.999 --> 30:03.998
- Yeah.
- For her, but I don't

30:03.999 --> 30:06.998
really know how she's honestly
feeling inside, because she

30:06.999 --> 30:09.998
doesn't stop long enough to talk
about it.

30:09.999 --> 30:10.999
- Yeah.
- I mean, I know this

30:11.000 --> 30:13.998
sounds crazy, 'cause you guys
think I'm nuts if I... if I have

30:13.999 --> 30:16.998
any compassion for the person on
the other side, but I worry

30:16.999 --> 30:20.998
about him, too, because I'm sure
he's struggling and feels

30:20.999 --> 30:22.998
horrible, and he's in a place
where he probably doesn't know

30:22.999 --> 30:24.998
- what to do.
- He was the one that

30:24.999 --> 30:26.998
- up.
- Well, he's definitely

30:26.999 --> 30:29.998
in the doghouse, but I'm more
worried right now about three

30:29.999 --> 30:32.998
little kids under the age of
five.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.998
I'm gonna reach out to him.
I think I'm gonna reach out.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.998
I'm just gonna pop him a text
and say, "Hey, how are you?"

30:37.999 --> 30:40.998
I really want to have a
conversation with Scott.

30:40.999 --> 30:44.998
I want him to find himself.
I want him to be a better person

30:44.999 --> 30:48.998
for himself and for nobody else,
so that he can be a great dad to

30:48.999 --> 30:52.998
those kids, because he loves
them and they love him, and he

30:52.999 --> 30:54.998
just needs to focus on his
family.

30:54.999 --> 30:56.998
I wish she would move on
from him.

30:56.999 --> 31:01.998
- I'm over him.
- I'm supposed to go out

31:01.999 --> 31:03.998
to lunch with Scott, and I just
wanted to make sure that I had

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
your blessing.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.998
Look at the moon.
Or is that the sun?

31:16.999 --> 31:18.998
Uh, I feel like I'm in Africa.
Malika, look.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.998
- Yeah, it's stunning.
- The sun's over here.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.998
Oh, right.
I know where my things are.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.998
- What are those, planets?
- Oh, my God!

31:25.999 --> 31:27.998
You guys, what are we doing?

31:27.999 --> 31:29.998
- Ooh, look at that fire.
- That's to light the

31:29.999 --> 31:32.998
- balloon, you idiot!
- Oh, my God, there's

31:32.999 --> 31:34.998
- the balloon.
- It's from gas.

31:34.999 --> 31:37.998
We've had such a crazy trip.
So much work.

31:37.999 --> 31:39.998
And I'm not gonna be in
Australia often, even though I

31:39.999 --> 31:42.998
love it here...
This is so cool.

31:42.999 --> 31:46.998
So I decided to stay an extra
day and take Malika and Jen up

31:46.999 --> 31:50.998
in a hot air balloon ride to do
something that's peaceful and

31:50.999 --> 31:52.998
beautiful.
Something that we will remember

31:52.999 --> 31:54.998
- forever.
- All right, here we go.

31:54.999 --> 31:57.998
- Bye!
- Here we go.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.998
Stop playing on your
phone and look at this.

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
Oh, my goodness.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.998
See the Sydney skyline?

32:03.999 --> 32:06.998
- Oh, my God!
- This is so insane,

32:06.999 --> 32:08.998
you guys.

32:08.999 --> 32:11.998
Kourt, look how crazy...

32:11.999 --> 32:13.998
That is so cool.
You know, I've been on one

32:13.999 --> 32:15.998
- before.
- Oh, you.

32:15.999 --> 32:18.998
- Okay, you are...
- Suck my.

32:18.999 --> 32:21.998
Bye.
Being up in this hot air

32:21.999 --> 32:25.998
balloon, it does give you time
to reflect, and I do think when

32:25.999 --> 32:28.998
I get back home, I want to talk
to Kourtney and Kim.

32:28.999 --> 32:32.998
I want to play fair, but I want
my sisters to pull the same

32:32.999 --> 32:34.998
share of the weight that I pull.

32:34.999 --> 32:37.998
But just because I don't have a
child doesn't mean I don't need

32:37.999 --> 32:41.998
"me time" to enjoy my life a
little more.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.998
You guys, I'm so excited about
today.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.998
That's a nice change
of attitude.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.998
Do you think Matt's ever
peed outside of that thing?

32:49.999 --> 32:52.998
- When he's up there?
- Probably.

32:52.999 --> 32:56.998
- For sure.
- Or, like, in a cup?

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
You're so silly.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.998
Kim?

33:05.999 --> 33:07.998
- Oh, hey there.
- How are you?

33:07.999 --> 33:10.998
- You look cute.
- Mom, there's two ice

33:10.999 --> 33:14.998
cream things I want, but I feel
like you should get them after.

33:14.999 --> 33:16.998
They always say never go to a
grocery store hungry.

33:16.999 --> 33:19.998
Well, I'm starving so
that's a problem.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.998
Where's Kourtney?

33:21.999 --> 33:25.998
She's always late.
See, Kourtney has everything

33:25.999 --> 33:28.999
that's green.
Like, she made me replace every

33:29.000 --> 33:31.998
single last thing in my kitchen
that's plastic.

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
Kim, we're turning over a new
leaf.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.999
A very green leaf.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.999
Hey, guys.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.999
- Hi!
- Hi, guys.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.998
- Hi, Mase!
- Hi.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.998
This has changed my
life, this store.

33:45.999 --> 33:46.999
- It has?
- Yes.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.998
- Hey, dude.
- Hi.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.998
We'll be back.
We're gonna go get water.

33:50.999 --> 33:51.999
Can I just tell you
something really quick?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.999
- Yes.
- So I'm supposed to go

33:54.000 --> 33:55.999
- out to lunch with Scott, um...
- Yeah. I don't think

33:56.000 --> 33:59.998
he's... I think he's, like,
M.I.A.

33:59.999 --> 34:03.998
Well, I didn't know he
was M.I.A., and I just wanted to

34:03.999 --> 34:05.998
make sure that I had your
blessing before I just go have

34:05.999 --> 34:08.998
- lunch with him.
- Yeah, but you don't

34:08.999 --> 34:11.998
need to go in public, where,
like, people see you.

34:11.999 --> 34:14.998
I want to be very
transparent with Kourtney and

34:14.999 --> 34:18.998
let her know that I want to talk
to Scott, because I want her

34:18.999 --> 34:20.998
blessing.
I want her to know how I feel.

34:20.999 --> 34:23.998
And I think it's important for
me to reach out to him because

34:23.999 --> 34:26.998
I want him to know that I'm here
for him.

34:26.999 --> 34:29.998
So I'm gonna call you

34:29.999 --> 34:33.998
later and let you know if he
reached out.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.998
Just tell me when I
see you at the house.

34:35.999 --> 34:37.998
But just so I'm clear before...

34:37.999 --> 34:39.998
I just wouldn't go
somewhere in public, 'cause

34:39.999 --> 34:41.998
- there's no need.
- Okay, but I have your

34:41.999 --> 34:42.999
blessing to have a chat with
him?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.998
Sure, he can come over.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.998
All right, I'll have
him come to my house, then.

34:46.999 --> 34:49.998
Okay, I'm going to
take him maybe to a quick pet

34:49.999 --> 34:51.998
store, and then I'll see you at
my house.

34:51.999 --> 34:53.998
- Pet store!
- Okay. Love you.

34:53.999 --> 34:55.999
P-P-Pet store!

35:00.999 --> 35:03.998
Come here, sister.

35:03.999 --> 35:06.998
Do I get a hug hello first?
Mmm...

35:06.999 --> 35:09.998
So do you want two of these, or
you want a Oreo?

35:09.999 --> 35:13.998
- One of those.
- Can I have one?

35:13.999 --> 35:16.998
- Of course.
- That's not organic.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.998
- That's not with organic eggs.
- That's not

35:18.999 --> 35:21.998
- with organic sprinkles.
- Mmm.

35:21.999 --> 35:24.998
This house has nothing organic
in it for me to eat.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.998
Yes, there is organic things.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.998
- Go eat the fruit.
- You are so tiny.

35:28.999 --> 35:30.998
I am... never been more jealous
of a human in my life.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.998
- Your tits are...
- Are heavier than you.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.998
Right, but that's
probably why you're bigger,

35:36.999 --> 35:40.998
'cause your boobs are so big.
I'm so jet-lagged from

35:40.999 --> 35:42.998
- Australia.
- You are? Why?

35:42.999 --> 35:46.998
'Cause I just came

35:46.999 --> 35:49.998
back from Australia.

35:49.999 --> 35:53.998
Look, I love going to these
places, I love doing these

35:53.999 --> 35:56.998
things.
I don't mind the work, but

35:56.999 --> 36:00.998
sometimes I feel like I really,
like, pick up the slack a lot of

36:00.999 --> 36:02.998
times when people...
I'm doing a kids' promotional

36:02.999 --> 36:06.998
tour, and I don't have kids.
You guys all have families and

36:06.999 --> 36:08.998
kids.
I have no friends anymore.

36:08.999 --> 36:11.998
I don't have time to, like, meet
people or go on dates because

36:11.999 --> 36:14.998
I've done too many jobs or
picked up the slack, so I've

36:14.999 --> 36:18.998
- lost everybody.
- Are you gonna go put

36:18.999 --> 36:20.998
- Mason to bed tonight?
- I don't know.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.998
- This whole is so weird.
- But part of love is

36:22.999 --> 36:30.999
being honest, and you really up.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.998
You guys all have
families and kids.

36:34.999 --> 36:37.998
I have nothing anymore, because
I've done too many jobs.

36:37.999 --> 36:41.998
I don't have time to meet people
or go on dates, or if I do, it

36:41.999 --> 36:43.998
has to dwindle out because then
I'm working too much and it's

36:43.999 --> 36:46.998
just a non-consistent
relationship.

36:46.999 --> 36:50.998
I just want when I want to have,
like, my fun time, maybe to,

36:50.999 --> 36:53.998
like, if you guys could ease up
on me just, like, a little.

36:53.999 --> 36:55.998
So why don't you
write down the things that are

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
- important to you, like, say...
- But that's not taking

36:58.000 --> 37:00.998
a two-week vacation.
Like, you guys have your lives.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.998
- That's what I'm saying.
- I'll pick up the slack.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
Well, I'll fill in
October, so you don't have to.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.998
I understand Khloe's point.
Clearly, Kim and I have been

37:10.999 --> 37:15.998
busier lately, having children.
And I do feel bad, and I want

37:15.999 --> 37:19.998
Khloe to have a personal life.
I want her to be happy.

37:19.999 --> 37:22.998
I don't want her to be stressed
out or overwhelmed.

37:22.999 --> 37:27.998
And I'm happy to try and step in
a little bit more.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.998
- I think that your issue is...
- But sometimes I...

37:30.999 --> 37:32.998
No, I'm gonna tell
you what your issue is, 'cause I

37:32.999 --> 37:34.998
- actually do know.
- Okay, what is it?

37:34.999 --> 37:39.998
You feel guilty
saying no to anything.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.998
- Yes. Very true.
- Like, so you've

37:41.999 --> 37:43.998
been overworked and you've been
doing all this stuff.

37:43.999 --> 37:46.998
Like, just say, "You know what,
I really need the day off

37:46.999 --> 37:48.998
tomorrow."
No one would

37:48.999 --> 37:49.999
- understand that.
- Yeah, they would.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.998
Have a baby.
It's, like, such a good excuse.

37:51.999 --> 37:53.998
Like, you don't have to do
anything.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.998
Who am I gonna have a
baby with? Batman?

37:55.999 --> 37:57.998
Wouldn't that be amazing?

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
- I love Batman.
- Who? What Batman?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.998
Any of them.
They're all good.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.998
Some freak on
Hollywood and Highland.

38:02.999 --> 38:05.998
No, he needs to be,
like, legit with the Batmobile.

38:05.999 --> 38:13.999
No, get out of my house.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.998
- Scott?
- Mm?

38:16.999 --> 38:19.998
You can come on in.
You know what, I have something

38:19.999 --> 38:23.998
really cute you can take over to
the kids that they might like.

38:23.999 --> 38:25.998
- All right.
- I found this at a

38:25.999 --> 38:27.998
store.
It's a whole pad.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.998
You color this, and then you
make it, like, a little mask.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.998
And they can put it on?

38:32.999 --> 38:33.999
- Yeah.
- That's fun.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.998
And is that, like, a bow?

38:35.999 --> 38:37.998
We need to figure out
what your daughter though is

38:37.999 --> 38:40.998
saying now.
She's like, "Don't let him in

38:40.999 --> 38:43.998
the house.
He didn't schedule the time."

38:43.999 --> 38:47.998
I'm like, "What? The time?"
I go, "I went to work, I did

38:47.999 --> 38:49.998
what I had to do, and now I'm
going to the house."

38:49.999 --> 38:51.998
- Right.
- Like...

38:51.999 --> 38:53.998
I don't know what's
going on with you guys, but

38:53.999 --> 38:57.998
maybe you need to think, "I'm
gonna try and be proactive in

38:57.999 --> 38:59.998
making this a better..."
Right, but every day

38:59.999 --> 39:02.998
it's a different story.
When we got separated, the whole

39:02.999 --> 39:04.998
thing was, "You're not gonna
have the kids stay with you, but

39:04.999 --> 39:08.998
I'm gonna have an open-door
policy here, that at any time,

39:08.999 --> 39:12.998
any hour, you want to be here,
you can be here with the kids."

39:12.999 --> 39:15.998
Then it went to, "You need to
schedule times."

39:15.999 --> 39:19.998
Then it went to taking the bar
codes off of all my cars so I

39:19.999 --> 39:24.998
couldn't get into the house
without dialing the house.

39:24.999 --> 39:27.998
I feel like I'm missing
a piece of the story.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.998
So am I.
Every single day, I was driving

39:30.999 --> 39:32.998
there, sitting with them all
day, every day.

39:32.999 --> 39:35.998
Do you want to just see
if we can get her on the phone?

39:35.999 --> 39:39.998
I mean...

39:39.999 --> 39:42.998
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.998
- Hi.
- I'm sitting here with

39:44.999 --> 39:46.998
Scott.
You're on speaker.

39:46.999 --> 39:47.999
Uh-huh.
- I'm just trying to be

39:48.000 --> 39:50.998
the mediator here and not cause
a problem, and you're my

39:50.999 --> 39:53.998
priority.
I'm just wondering, from your

39:53.999 --> 39:57.998
perspective, because Scott seems
a little confused, because he

39:57.999 --> 40:00.998
thought there was an open-door
policy, that he could come by

40:00.999 --> 40:02.998
- whenever...
- There was.

40:02.999 --> 40:06.998
There was.
But that has changed.

40:06.999 --> 40:08.998
- He was flaking too often.
- Yeah.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.998
Every time I tried
to have him sit and have dinner

40:10.999 --> 40:13.998
with them, he sits in the other
room on his phone.

40:13.999 --> 40:17.998
He flaked on going to the kids'
first day of school.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.998
He says, "I can't go 'cause I
hate school.

40:20.999 --> 40:23.998
I get anxious."
When really, he went out and,

40:23.999 --> 40:25.998
like, partied through the next
day.

40:25.999 --> 40:28.998
Just like a real ass.

40:28.999 --> 40:31.998
His main concern is himself, not
the kids.

40:31.999 --> 40:39.999
And that's what's important here
is the kids.

40:41.999 --> 40:44.998
He flaked on going
to the kids' first day of

40:44.999 --> 40:47.998
school and, like, partied
through the next day.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.998
Just like a real ass.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.998
His main concern is himself, not
the kids.

40:52.999 --> 40:55.998
And that's what's important here
is the kids.

40:55.999 --> 40:58.998
Didn't you tell me to
stay at the house when you were

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
- gone?
- I asked you if you

41:00.000 --> 41:02.998
wanted to; you said yes.
You flaked on Sunday.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.998
Right, so I'm there
today and I'm going there, and

41:04.999 --> 41:06.998
then you're telling the gate I
can't come in?

41:06.999 --> 41:08.998
You didn't make a plan.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
You know you need to tell in
advance.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.998
The kids had plans.
It's like, I've got to get off

41:12.999 --> 41:14.998
this hamster wheel, 'cause this
is not what my life is going to

41:14.999 --> 41:17.998
be.
So none of these things are

41:17.999 --> 41:22.998
happening anymore.
They need consistency, they need

41:22.999 --> 41:27.998
a parent who is going to be
present and provide them with a

41:27.999 --> 41:32.998
beneficial experience, not
something that's harmful.

41:32.999 --> 41:36.999
I can't wait for the day that we
can all hang out together, do

41:37.000 --> 41:40.998
things with the kids as a
family, but he's not in that

41:40.999 --> 41:44.998
- place right now.
- Um, would it be okay if

41:44.999 --> 41:48.998
he went by and put Mason to bed
tonight, and P?

41:48.999 --> 41:51.998
Sure, if he was
there when they get home to have

41:51.999 --> 41:53.998
dinner at 5:30, sit and have
dinner with them...

41:53.999 --> 41:56.998
Anything else, boss?
You want me to fold any of your

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
- clothes or anything?
- I don't want you to

41:58.000 --> 42:00.998
stop by for 30 minutes and then
you get a call to go out, and

42:00.999 --> 42:03.998
then you're like, "Sorry, I got
to go."

42:03.999 --> 42:05.998
The kids are like, "Why did Dad
leave?"

42:05.999 --> 42:06.999
'Cause we don't live together.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.998
It's better I see them than not
see them at all.

42:08.999 --> 42:11.998
Can you not commit
to going for, like, two and a

42:11.999 --> 42:15.998
- half hours?
- Of course you can.

42:15.999 --> 42:18.998
Kourtney, we're gonna hang up
now, but he'll be over there by

42:18.999 --> 42:20.998
- 5:30.
- Okay.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.998
- I love you.
- Love you, too. Bye.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.998
Are you gonna go put
Mason to bed tonight?

42:25.999 --> 42:27.998
- I don't know.
- This whole is so weird.

42:27.999 --> 42:29.998
But do you want to?
That-that shouldn't be...

42:29.999 --> 42:30.999
- That... this doesn't matter.
- No, I'm going to

42:31.000 --> 42:32.998
- Florida.
- You're going to

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- Florida?
- Yeah.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.998
- When?
- In a couple hours.

42:35.999 --> 42:39.998
Come on.
If that was my window to spend

42:39.999 --> 42:41.998
with my kids, I'd go enjoy my
window.

42:41.999 --> 42:43.998
This is just crazy.
It's like, "All right, sit with

42:43.999 --> 42:46.998
your kid, eat dinner with your
kid, put your kid to sleep, and

42:46.999 --> 42:48.998
then get out."
Listen, but it's part

42:48.999 --> 42:50.998
of the price that you're gonna
have to pay for this

42:50.999 --> 42:55.998
whole thing.
You have to earn back trust that

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- you've lost.
- No, I know.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.998
- It's just...
- Well,.

42:58.999 --> 42:59.999
It's just not as easy
as it sounds.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.998
No, it's not gonna be
easy, but you have to fight...

43:01.999 --> 43:03.998
I've talked to her
about it, she said...

43:03.999 --> 43:05.998
You don't just talk
about it, you have to show your

43:05.999 --> 43:08.998
actions.
I have to be honest with you.

43:08.999 --> 43:16.999
Part of love is being honest,
and you really up.

43:18.999 --> 43:20.998
- On the next episode...
- Surprise!

43:20.999 --> 43:23.998
Welcome to your
graduation ceremony.

43:23.999 --> 43:26.998
You know how, like,

43:26.999 --> 43:29.998
I'm kind of, like, psychic?
The other day, something woke me

43:29.999 --> 43:31.998
up; it whispered in my ear.
It was going, "Khlo..."

43:31.999 --> 43:33.998
I just want to know who my
little friend is.

43:33.999 --> 43:35.998
It just jumped!

43:35.999 --> 43:37.998
You have elevated
blood pressure.

43:37.999 --> 43:40.998
After Paris, my feet and
my hands completely swelled up.

43:40.999 --> 43:42.998
I really hope it's not diabetes.
I'm, like, actually scared.
