00:06.360 --> 00:08.090
Alex is gonna love her room.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.760
The flowery thingies are perfect
for my little princess.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.990
Hey, check it out.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.200
The wallpaper glue
dried my fingers together.

00:17.510 --> 00:20.030
Dude, that's awesome. Give it up.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.320
Come on, guys,
stop messing around, all right?

00:25.450 --> 00:31.680
To do this job right, you need to focus,
you need intensity and a root beer.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.790
Hi, Daddy.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.620
l like the new wallpaper.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.750
And l'm glad you're not finished yet,
because you're really gonna love this.

00:41.130 --> 00:43.530
Pink fur wallpaper.

00:44.540 --> 00:49.270
Watch Daddy's little girl
make us put up her new wall fur.

00:49.970 --> 00:51.070
Don't you love it?

00:51.210 --> 00:53.340
But what about the little flowers?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.000
lt's a little young for me.

00:55.150 --> 00:56.640
l think l'm ready for this.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.140
You know, now that l think about it,
this pattern does look like my boxers.

01:01.890 --> 01:04.550
l almost didn't get the pink fur,
because the guy at the store said

01:04.690 --> 01:06.210
only a professional could put it up.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.620
But he doesn't know my dad.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.020
Well, you got that right.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.790
The Russo boys are on it.

01:12.930 --> 01:15.230
We're gonna need more glue.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.530
Yeah, but l thought we were gonna work
on my room next.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.430
Your room's good enough.

01:19.870 --> 01:23.070
Good enough for Justin's room maybe,
not for the J-Man.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.340
Who's the J-Man?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.240
Me. That's my nickname.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.510
Yeah, who calls you that?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.910
Lots of people.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.140
You know, not at school,
but around the neighborhood.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.050
Okay. A couple.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.390
Me mostly.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.490
But that's just because we haven't redone
my room.

01:42.630 --> 01:45.060
- Your room looks great.
- No, Justin's right.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.630
We shouldn't forget about him.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.160
That's why he should have
this wallpaper.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.000
l'm comfortable being forgotten.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.630
lt'll totally tie together your little
action figures and the big water stain

01:55.770 --> 01:56.900
from where the roof leaks.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.310
l was gonna paint over that water stain.
But you know what? No, you're right.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.570
This wallpaper would look way better.

02:02.710 --> 02:05.340
Attaboy.
Come on, guys, let's go before it dries.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.540
Let's hustle. Fun and games are over.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.680
Dad, l was kidding.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.410
You gotta show me how you do that.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.490
Unless you wanna be Daddy's little girl,
l can't help you.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.320
But that shirt's got you halfway there.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

03:19.520 --> 03:23.960
Honey, you didn't make a giant burrito
out of Max again, did you?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.890
No, Mom.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.290
lt's no fun anymore. He likes it.

03:28.430 --> 03:30.400
The rug's for my room.
l found it in the basement.

03:30.530 --> 03:33.060
Honey, you know you're not supposed
to be going down there.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.930
Well, Daddy said l could take
whatever l want from down there.

03:36.570 --> 03:38.670
Oh, well, all right.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.300
We like to put up a united front.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.880
So fine.

03:42.010 --> 03:44.500
And if you see him,
could you tell him l need to talk to him?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.640
Oh, my gosh.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.550
What happened to you guys?

03:52.690 --> 03:55.350
What happened was
Alex got pink fur wallpaper,

03:55.490 --> 03:57.220
and we just finished hanging it up
for her.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.290
Mom, will you vacuum us off?

03:59.430 --> 04:00.860
Here's the crevice device.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.590
Be careful.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.090
l don't wanna be vacuumed.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.700
l'm wearing this to school tomorrow.

04:09.370 --> 04:11.840
So, Justin,
how's your room coming along?

04:11.980 --> 04:13.470
l have girl wallpaper.

04:13.610 --> 04:14.770
And are you okay with that?

04:14.910 --> 04:16.470
No.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.769
l gotta make it a man's room.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.250
l need man stuff.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.540
Okay, like what?

04:20.680 --> 04:24.810
Like pictures of girls on motorcycles
and my favorite band, Tears of Blood.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.550
T.O.B.

04:26.690 --> 04:27.990
Stands for Tears of Blood.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.090
l got it.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.250
Listen, that sounds awesome,

04:33.400 --> 04:37.360
and, like, l'll probably not be visiting
your room that often.

04:37.770 --> 04:43.600
But if you want some real scary stuff,
Dad's chair shaped like a baseball glove,

04:43.740 --> 04:44.800
it's in the basement.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.540
Oh, that's awesome.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.710
Baseball glove chair?

04:51.850 --> 04:56.150
l knew you didn't throw it away.
l can't wait to sit in it.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.360
And now at number four,
previously at number six,

05:04.500 --> 05:08.020
Spontaneous Bling with ''Oh, Yeah,''

05:25.250 --> 05:27.840
A flying carpet.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.480
Random.

05:36.390 --> 05:38.550
That's it, honey. You're good.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.030
Fits like a glove.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.630
Hey, it is.

05:44.030 --> 05:45.870
Listen, that's going to Justin's room.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.940
- But--
- Guys, check it out.

05:48.070 --> 05:50.200
This tiki dude's
gonna man up my room.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.210
And so is the guitar
after l smash it and hang it on the wall.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.570
You're not smashing anything.
That's mine.

05:55.710 --> 06:00.240
l used to play it in an all-girl mariachi band
at Las PiÃ±atas.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.490
- l didn't know you played the guitar.
- Yeah.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.320
She doesn't.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.060
But thanks for finding it.

06:10.190 --> 06:11.860
No, honey, thank you.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.190
lf you hadn't sent Alex down there
to get that rug, we never would've found it.

06:15.330 --> 06:16.990
No, hold on. What rug?

06:21.570 --> 06:22.730
- Alex?
- Honey?

06:22.870 --> 06:24.340
Alex?

06:24.810 --> 06:26.570
l thought she had
the magic flying carpet.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.230
What the...?

06:31.920 --> 06:35.370
Hey, so how's it going?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.320
Mom, l see you have the guitar out.

06:40.260 --> 06:43.230
You thinking about playing it now?

06:43.760 --> 06:46.390
Alex, stop trying to avoid the subject.

06:46.530 --> 06:48.460
You said l could take stuff
from the basement.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.930
You know you're not supposed
to use magic unsupervised.

06:51.070 --> 06:53.970
You should've come to me as soon
as you realized that was a magic carpet.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.040
Daddy, l really didn't do anything wrong.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.200
lt's not like l was giving people rides.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.780
Yeah.

07:00.910 --> 07:02.380
Can l go again?

07:02.510 --> 07:05.540
That's it. l'm taking this carpet
right back to the basement.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.020
And why don't you leave your guitar
down there too, honey?

07:08.150 --> 07:12.280
Listen, if your baseball glove chair
stays above ground, so does my guitar.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.820
Alex, l am really disappointed in you.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.360
Daddy, the rug looks great in here.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.930
- lt ties the whole room together.
- Well, look around you.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.660
Can't let you keep a magic carpet.
You don't know how to drive it.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.700
- So you should teach me how to drive.
- No way.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.940
l can't believe it.
He just said no to Daddy's little girl.

07:30.070 --> 07:31.670
Maybe it's crazy day.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.370
Hey, Dad, can l have a cell phone?

07:33.510 --> 07:34.880
What? No.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.550
lt's not that day.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.820
- Daddy, please?
- Absolutely not.

07:42.490 --> 07:44.480
And don't look at me
with those puppy-dog eyes

07:44.620 --> 07:47.180
and think l'm just gonna melt
in your hands.

07:47.690 --> 07:50.320
ls that what you think l do, Daddy?

07:52.300 --> 07:55.200
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

07:55.330 --> 07:56.820
You are not gonna guilt me into this.

07:56.970 --> 07:59.630
Just because l taught Justin,
doesn't mean l automatically have--

08:02.770 --> 08:04.070
You taught Justin?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.610
Well, l guess that makes sense
since he's your first-born

08:07.750 --> 08:10.510
and he'll always have a more
special place in your heart than me.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.340
Oh, you can't possibly think
that l love him more than you.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.010
l love you all equally,
just not at the same time.

08:17.150 --> 08:19.620
We'll talk about this in the morning.
Good night.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.590
- lt's only 4:00.
- Who are you? Father Time?

08:22.730 --> 08:26.090
Daddy, give me one good reason
why l can't learn how to fly the carpet.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.700
You can't fly the carpet
because you're not old enough.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.730
- Well, how old was Justin?
- Eighteen.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.200
l'm 16 now.

08:32.340 --> 08:35.000
Oh, so you lied to me, huh?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.830
Well, we'll talk about that
in the morning.

08:36.970 --> 08:38.870
- Good night.
- Okay, Daddy.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.870
Even though you haven't given me
a good reason,

08:41.010 --> 08:46.570
l know you must have one, because that's
how much l respect you and love you.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.890
Okay, fine.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.890
We'll start carpet-flying lessons
tomorrow.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.790
And that's how you do that.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.930
And if you don't vacuum it
every 3000 miles, the filter gets clogged.

09:10.070 --> 09:13.410
lt makes for a very unstable ride.
Not safe.

09:13.540 --> 09:14.640
Oh, so l get it.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.680
Just bring it to you every 3000 miles
so you can do all that stuff,

09:17.820 --> 09:19.080
because you're so good at it.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.980
Yeah, well, it does relax me.

09:23.490 --> 09:26.180
Okay. Moving on to the rules of the sky.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.950
What kind of cloud should you fly into?

09:29.030 --> 09:30.430
Trick question. None of them.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.460
Because it's very easy
to become confused in a cloud.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.960
Which way's up? Which way's down?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.290
l don't know. Crash.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.370
What would you crash into in a cloud?

09:39.500 --> 09:41.770
A confused wizard
on a carpet going the other way.

09:42.740 --> 09:47.370
Plus, you don't want to expose fine wool
to that kind of moisture.

09:47.510 --> 09:50.500
lt's very hard to dry,
and then it starts to smell like a camel.

09:50.650 --> 09:53.310
- ls that bad?
- You don't wanna know.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.150
Dad, stop trying to scare me.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.050
l'm a big girl. l can handle this.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.850
Oh, a big girl.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.220
You're a big girl, huh?

10:01.360 --> 10:03.590
Okay, big girl, enough talk, let's walk.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.390
- Let's take her up.
- Great, l'm ready.

10:05.530 --> 10:06.720
Yeah, it's very easy to fly.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.300
All you have to do
is curl left, lean right, go left,

10:09.430 --> 10:12.100
curl right, lean left, go right,
curl down, go down.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.500
- Got it?
- Curl what, lean who, go where?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.570
- Just go slower.
- Go slower?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.900
All right, enough chitchat.
You don't learn by teaching.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.200
You learn by doing.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.180
Let's take her up.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.980
Let's go.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.280
Hey, isn't this fun, just the two of us?

10:33.790 --> 10:35.550
Why are you looking at me?
Eyes on the sky.

10:35.690 --> 10:36.780
Not me, the sky.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.550
Honey, come on.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.490
All right.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.160
Let's turn left here.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.060
No, it's too jerky, too jerky.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.300
lt's all in the wrist.
l told you, it's in the wrist.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.870
l'm barely touching it.

10:49.010 --> 10:53.030
Look, you're thinking too much.
Don't think, just fly.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.140
How can l think when you're yelling?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.750
l told you not to think. Don't think, okay?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.180
lf you're not gonna hear me,
maybe l should yell louder.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.180
l can't do anything
with you yelling like that.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.750
Why are you yelling like that?
You never yell at me like that.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.050
l'm not yelling. l'm just loud-teaching.

11:07.190 --> 11:09.020
Watch out, watch out.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.490
Watch where? Watch where?

11:10.630 --> 11:11.720
Where? Everywhere.

11:11.860 --> 11:12.920
Watch everywhere.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.760
How can l watch everywhere?

11:28.850 --> 11:30.370
Oh, hi.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.350
- How'd it go?
- l'm not talking to him.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.540
l'm not talking to her.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.980
Or watching the big fight tonight.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.020
No, apparently, l am.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.080
She flew me right into this.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.820
She's not ready for lessons.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.890
l don't know why she's so anxious
to fly anyway.

11:47.030 --> 11:48.660
She needs to be home with us.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.230
And where are my pudding cups?

11:51.370 --> 11:53.770
You ate them all, remember?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.430
Where does she think she's going to
on that carpet anyway?

11:56.570 --> 11:59.470
l don't know. But wherever it is, honey,
she's gonna come back.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.740
Sweetie, do you think maybe
you're not upset about the flying lessons

12:03.880 --> 12:06.610
as much as you are
about not wanting our little girl to grow up?

12:07.250 --> 12:08.680
That's ridiculous.

12:08.820 --> 12:13.310
And until we solve this pudding crisis,
l can't even think straight.

12:14.830 --> 12:17.060
Need more pudding.

12:17.830 --> 12:20.820
Mom, check out
what someone was throwing out.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.800
lt's hard to imagine someone
not wanting that.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.930
Why do you want that?

12:27.070 --> 12:29.370
Something's gotta take your eye off
that girlie wallpaper.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.770
And how can you not look at this?

12:31.910 --> 12:35.570
Oh, gosh, it still has bad breath.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.650
Dad's not here, right?

12:41.790 --> 12:44.810
Why? Daddy's little girl
doesn't wanna see Daddy?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.190
Well, that's what l wanna talk
to you about.

12:48.730 --> 12:51.890
When we were on our lesson,
Dad got all tense and frustrated,

12:52.030 --> 12:54.830
like how he acts
when he's around you and your dolls.

12:54.970 --> 12:57.160
Action figures.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.430
Collectibles in their original packaging.

13:02.170 --> 13:05.070
Dad's never acted
that way with me before.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.570
What should l do about it?

13:06.710 --> 13:09.840
l'd love to help, but l've never been
Daddy's little favorite anything.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.210
That's why l have girl wallpaper.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.720
And l'm hoping that Boris here
is gonna man that up.

13:14.850 --> 13:16.940
Wait, l really need your help.

13:17.090 --> 13:20.150
How do l get Dad to stop being mad
at me so he'll teach me how to fly?

13:21.090 --> 13:22.460
Okay.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.490
We're gonna need to pull out
the big guns here.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.530
What does Dad love even more
than pudding?

13:26.660 --> 13:28.150
Even more than us sometimes?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.060
- Breakfast for dinner.
- Exactly.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.130
- You gotta make that happen.
- l can do that.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.000
And you gotta get something very special
to top it off.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.440
- Baked ziti from Mario's.
- Baked ziti from Mario's. Yes.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.240
Now give me $10.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.600
What? Why?

13:40.740 --> 13:42.610
lt was your great idea.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.840
l can't afford to always be this smart.

13:47.150 --> 13:49.180
Yeah, Boris just lost an eye.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.480
That's okay. Boris looks even tougher.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.650
You know why? Pig with an eye patch.

14:13.240 --> 14:17.010
Dad, Mom and l made breakfast
for dinner. l know it's your favorite.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.950
Thank you, Theresa.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.090
Dad, l melted your butter
and l even went all the way uptown

14:30.230 --> 14:32.890
to get that special blueberry syrup
you like.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.760
No, thanks.
l'm trying to cut down on fruit.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.460
l feel the same way about vegetables.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.300
Who's with me?

14:47.180 --> 14:50.410
And, Dad, guess what Alex got you
for dessert.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.070
Baked ziti.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.480
Jerry, you really love ziti.

14:56.950 --> 14:58.050
l don't think you heard me.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.520
l'm trying to cut down on my fruit.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.790
Yes, tomato is a fruit.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.660
l'm gonna finish my breakfast for dinner
on the terrace.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.430
l'll come with you.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.090
Alone.

15:15.970 --> 15:18.670
Right, because you don't want me
to catch a cold.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.740
Thanks, Dad.

15:26.780 --> 15:28.720
l know it's all tense and everything,

15:28.850 --> 15:31.220
so l don't have to take a bath tonight,
right?

15:43.800 --> 15:45.430
Alex.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.460
Alex.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.800
- Alex.
- Who?

15:50.140 --> 15:52.610
You scared me.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.040
Oh, l get it. We're pulling a prank on Max
like he and l do to you sometimes.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.740
You guys play pranks on me?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.810
Never mind.
What are you doing in here?

16:03.420 --> 16:04.980
Our dinner plan didn't work.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.060
l know. And thanks for waking me up
to remind me.

16:07.190 --> 16:08.560
Good night.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.460
Look, flying lessons
