00:02.733 --> 00:03.967
- MAN: Previously
on "Still the King"--

00:04.067 --> 00:06.000
- You can't invite my girlfriend
to join your dumb group.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.867
- It's Coy's company.
He's the boss.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.267
- Ronnie is definitely our guy.

00:10.367 --> 00:12.767
- I mean, I didn't tell 'em
anything, I just told 'em about

00:12.867 --> 00:14.100
the day-to-day operations
of the company

00:14.200 --> 00:16.367
and how you taught me
how to practically steal money.

00:16.467 --> 00:17.900
Will you marry me?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.567
- Yes, Ronnie,
yes, I'll marry you.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.967
- [crowd cheering]

00:24.067 --> 00:25.233
- You okay, Vern?

00:25.333 --> 00:27.533
- I ain't ever had
a jealous bone in my damn body.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.000
- I never mentioned anything
about being jealous.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.700
- I'm gonna go make
some poor decisions.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.467
- [birds chirping]

00:39.000 --> 00:43.367
- *

00:52.667 --> 00:53.900
- Morning, Ronnie.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.967
- Oh, hey, Hibachi guys.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.500
Uh, if this is about brunch, I'm
gonna have to take a raincheck.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.567
Coy says I'm not supposed
talk to you guys anymore.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.700
Says you're gonna take advantage
of me, not in a good way.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.300
- That's because
we're not Hibachi guys.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.667
We work for the SEC.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.900
- That's the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

01:09.067 --> 01:09.900
We're after your boss.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.667
- What? You lied to me?

01:11.767 --> 01:13.333
You can't trust
two random dudes you met

01:13.433 --> 01:15.067
in a Teppanyaki restaurant,
then who can you trust?

01:15.133 --> 01:19.133
- Look, Ronnie, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.333
It's up to you.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.300
- Oh, I got news for you, pal.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.633
- Ronford Manly only
does things the hard way.

01:25.733 --> 01:26.967
- *

01:27.067 --> 01:28.967
- I love it when
they do it the hard way.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.900
- Do you, Gene?
Do you?

01:31.067 --> 01:33.633
- *

01:36.400 --> 01:38.767
- [brakes squealing]

01:38.867 --> 01:41.633
- *

01:46.467 --> 01:49.833
* Still The King *

01:49.933 --> 01:51.667
- Were you here when
the others were formed?

01:51.767 --> 01:53.900
- Oh, yeah, we've been tracking
these crop circles for years.

01:54.067 --> 01:56.800
And, uh, you know, a lot of
people wanna know, is it legit?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.833
And I'll tell you right
now, it's 100% legit.

01:58.933 --> 02:00.400
These are aliens.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.867
- Walt, one of your weirdo
buddies is on the news in here.

02:02.967 --> 02:04.367
- More like weirdo rival.

02:04.467 --> 02:07.067
He's like the Stephen Hawking
to my Neil deGrasse Tyson.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.433
- Yeah, exactly like that.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.467
- Okay, flowers ordered,
evites sent.

02:10.567 --> 02:11.767
Oh, Charlotte, I need to know

02:11.867 --> 02:13.533
if you're bringing that boy
you're seeing.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.100
- Oh.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.233
- What happened?
Did you guys break up?

02:18.333 --> 02:19.633
Why didn't you tell me?

02:19.733 --> 02:22.433
- You've had a ton of stuff
on your mind, and I'm fine.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.867
I talked to dad about it, and
he was actually very helpful.

02:24.967 --> 02:27.367
- I told her there's plenty
of fish in the sea.

02:27.467 --> 02:31.100
And next time, try to find one
swimming in the same school.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.933
- Hey, want me to rough him
up for you?

02:33.067 --> 02:34.567
I know people.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.233
Or person.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.633
It's Dale.

02:38.733 --> 02:41.333
- That is very sweet, Walt,
but no assault necessary.

02:41.433 --> 02:43.300
- Hey, do you have
any aluminum foil?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.700
- Are you taking leftovers?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.300
- Leftovers? No, why?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.733
- It's in the drawer
by the stove.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.567
If you see Ronnie out there,
will you tell him

02:50.667 --> 02:52.100
to speed walk his butt home?

02:52.200 --> 02:54.367
- Copy that.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.433
- Hey, are you alright?
- No, I'm not alright.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.400
I'm completely overwhelmed.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
And we have all this
wedding stuff to do today,

03:00.600 --> 03:01.933
and Ronnie's not
picking up his phone.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.300
I don't wanna do this alone.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.967
It's embarrassing.

03:05.067 --> 03:06.967
Especially when you're eight
and a half months pregnant.

03:07.067 --> 03:10.333
- Oh, you don't look a day over
seven and three-quarters.

03:10.433 --> 03:12.500
- Well, and I could skip school
and help you out.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
- You're not missing
any more school.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.333
- Vernon, do you mind
taking her? I'm running late.

03:16.433 --> 03:17.867
- No problem.

03:17.967 --> 03:21.100
- Can Mabel drop you off this
evening to try on your dress?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.767
Do I need to be
worried about Ronnie?

03:22.867 --> 03:24.067
- No, he's fine.

03:24.167 --> 03:27.067
He probably just got distracted
by something shiny.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.067
- You think you went a little
overboard here, Gene?

03:29.133 --> 03:30.533
- Fine.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.633
We're gonna give you
a chance here, Ronnie.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.733
We want you to wear a wire...

03:36.833 --> 03:40.233
and get Coy to open up
about his operation on tape.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.600
- What?
Ronnie's no snitch, boys.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.967
Besides, I can't wear a wire.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.133
I'm not good under pressure.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.600
I mean-[laughs--I break out
in cold sweats,

03:47.700 --> 03:50.633
my left arm goes numb,
my elbow gets a weird switch.

03:50.733 --> 03:52.900
I mean, sometimes
I even start to faint.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.067
- That sounds like a stroke.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.433
You might wanna--
- We are taking

03:55.533 --> 03:58.467
this company down
with our without you!

03:58.567 --> 04:01.467
Now we are giving you a chance
here, Ronnie, to help us

04:01.567 --> 04:04.867
and save yourself
some hard time.

04:04.967 --> 04:06.867
- But Coy's a good guy.

04:06.967 --> 04:07.933
- A good guy?

04:08.067 --> 04:09.500
Jim, the photos.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.067
See these guys, Ronnie?

04:15.067 --> 04:17.300
You know what they all
had in common?

04:17.400 --> 04:19.500
- They all had strokes?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.900
- They all worked for Coy!

04:21.067 --> 04:22.167
- Oh.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.067
Whoo, you had me worried
with that damn stroke talk.

04:24.133 --> 04:28.733
- They all worked with Coy,
and they all ended up dead!

04:28.833 --> 04:29.667
- Coy killed 'em!

04:29.767 --> 04:30.867
- No, cancer, car accident,

04:30.967 --> 04:32.500
complications
from leech therapy.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.367
- Geesh, way to ruin
the implied threat.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.133
- Look, the point is
they all ended up

04:37.233 --> 04:39.600
broke, dead, or in jail.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.600
You don't wanna end up
like them, Ronnie...

04:41.700 --> 04:43.167
do you?

04:43.267 --> 04:46.100
- [static buzzes]

04:46.200 --> 04:48.833
- VOICE ON HEADPHONES: People
of Earth, we come in peace.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.133
- That's me.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.433
Nice try.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.333
We all know you're just here
to mine our gold

04:58.433 --> 05:00.800
to save your home planet's
atmosphere.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.733
- I think I might
have found a pattern.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.633
Come on.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.867
So if you look at the times
and locations of the circles,

05:08.967 --> 05:11.067
it's pretty clear
which constellation emerges.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.300
- Hercules?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.733
- No, based on where
the new circles are cropping up,

05:14.833 --> 05:16.767
I think I know which one it is.
- Big Dipper?

05:16.867 --> 05:18.100
- No.
- [unintelligible]

05:18.200 --> 05:20.800
- Look, it's Orian. It's Orian.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.767
- Of course. Orian's Belt.
- Yes.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.767
- With the pyramids.
- Yes.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.900
- Okay, well, according
to this, the next crop circle

05:28.067 --> 05:31.067
should show up
right here tonight.

05:31.133 --> 05:32.333
- Yeah.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.933
- What does Reggie
think about this?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.567
- I didn't tell him yet.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.600
I wanted to share it with you.
UTI first.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.933
- We need protective eyewear.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.100
- Check.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.733
- A demagnetized compass,
got one right here.

05:42.833 --> 05:43.733
- Check.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.067
- And we also need
sandwich baggies.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.200
- Check.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.533
Wait, what do we need
sandwich baggies for?

05:49.633 --> 05:50.633
- Sandwiches.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.433
It could be a long night.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.067
- Oh, smart.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.067
- [laughs] Hello, hello.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.067
Welcome, welcome.

06:01.167 --> 06:04.100
- I need to set up a registry.
- Baby shower, I assume?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.067
- It's a wedding.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.433
- [laughs] I see.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.267
Lick of time, it looks like.
Uh, boop.

06:10.367 --> 06:12.267
Yes, and name?

06:12.367 --> 06:13.967
- Debbie Cooke. Yeah.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.100
- And will the groom
be joining you?

06:16.200 --> 06:17.633
- Yep, I'm here.

06:17.733 --> 06:19.533
Had to park the car.

06:19.633 --> 06:21.467
How you doing, darling?
- What are you doing here?

06:21.567 --> 06:24.200
- [sighs] So...

06:29.067 --> 06:30.067
- What are you doing here?

06:30.167 --> 06:32.700
- Uh, you said be here,
so I'm here.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.867
- This is my fiancé.
- Ronnie.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.300
- Yes, Ron--Ronnie.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.967
- Dumb name, I know it.
- It's not a dumb name.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.267
- I had dumb parents.
- His parents aren't dumb.

06:43.367 --> 06:44.400
- Okie-dokie.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.600
Well, here is a registry gun
for each of you.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.233
Yes. And just point
at the items you want,

06:50.333 --> 06:53.800
and they will add that item
to your gift registry.

06:53.900 --> 06:54.867
- Let's go shopping, baby.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.367
- Let's do it.
- Whoo!

07:03.067 --> 07:04.667
- [imitating laser gun]

07:04.767 --> 07:07.267
- Geesh, what are you, 12?

07:07.367 --> 07:10.067
- [imitating laser gun]

07:10.100 --> 07:13.200

- [laughing]

07:32.467 --> 07:33.767
- Here we go.

07:33.867 --> 07:34.733
Sheep's wool.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.933
- It's nice.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.467

07:40.900 --> 07:44.267
- [imitating laser gun]

07:48.867 --> 07:50.067
- You got me.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.833
- [laughing]
- What are you doing?

07:53.933 --> 07:55.867
- I was trying to do
a commando roll like you,

07:55.967 --> 07:57.767
but I forgot
there's a baby onboard.

07:57.867 --> 07:59.233
- Get up here you crazy thing.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.300
You gotta come see this.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
- What is it?

08:01.500 --> 08:02.900
- Remember how the waffles
are always burnt

08:03.067 --> 08:04.400
in the top left corner?
- Uh-huh.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.567
- Well, look it, "va-la."

08:05.667 --> 08:06.700
Fixes our problems right here.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.600
We totally need this.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.500
- Vernon, I mean, I appreciate
you showing up so I don't have

08:11.600 --> 08:15.733
to do this alone, but I mean,
you realize once I'm married,

08:15.833 --> 08:17.367
you're gonna have to move out.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.333
- Of course I do.
- Okay.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.167
- But that doesn't mean
I can't still come over

08:21.267 --> 08:22.733
and make you waffles, does it?

08:22.833 --> 08:24.467
- Well, that's kinda the thing.

08:24.567 --> 08:27.767
I mean, once I'm married,
I'm not gonna want anyone

08:27.867 --> 08:29.300
but Ronnie making me waffles.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.067
- Now when you
say making waffles--

08:31.167 --> 08:34.433
- I mean waffles,
I mean everything, Vernon.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.800
- This one also makes Panini.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.067
- [imitating laser gun]

08:39.167 --> 08:41.767
[laughs]

08:41.867 --> 08:44.067
Think you folks
got everything you want?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.533
- To be honest with ya,
I'm having trouble

08:46.633 --> 08:49.067
getting this one to scan.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.267
- Maybe it's out of stock.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.667
- I reckon so.

08:52.767 --> 08:56.167
- *

09:01.533 --> 09:03.433
- LEIA: Right here, right here.
It's on the right.

09:05.167 --> 09:06.467
It's still kinda early though.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.800
It's daylight.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.067
- Well, you know what they say.

09:09.167 --> 09:10.633
Early bird catches the wormhole.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.167
- [laughs] Space humor.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.500
I love it.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.200
Remember when I told you
about Colombo?

09:16.300 --> 09:17.500
- Yeah, it's
your favorite constellation.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.700
- Yeah, it is.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.067
It's gonna show up tonight
around here.

09:20.133 --> 09:22.133
- This is gonna be so much
cooler than the planetarium.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.433
- Yeah.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.433
- Oh, look, how'd
this get in there?

09:28.533 --> 09:31.500
- Nice. Good idea.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.133
Did you bring cups?
- No.

09:34.233 --> 09:37.533
Uh...but I brought these.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.867
- Okay.

09:39.967 --> 09:42.933
- This goes in this.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.367
And then you can
just drink like this.

09:45.467 --> 09:46.700
- Alright.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.633
- *

09:53.933 --> 09:56.067
- You know, maybe
we should just--

09:56.133 --> 09:58.067
- Just drink out of the bottle.
- Yeah. [laughs]

10:00.600 --> 10:02.833
Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:02.933 --> 10:05.933
- [horse neighs]

10:06.033 --> 10:08.400
- [whip cracks]

10:08.500 --> 10:12.333
- [Western music plays]

10:23.867 --> 10:25.633
- COY: Oh, Ronnie, come on in.

10:25.733 --> 10:26.800
- Nice shorts, Ron.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.967
They make those in men's?

10:28.067 --> 10:31.600
- BOTH: [laughing]

10:31.700 --> 10:32.733
- Hey, a baby flea called.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.767
It wants its tiny [bleep] back!
- I'll--

10:34.867 --> 10:37.300
- Whoa,
reign it in...stallions.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.833
How can I help you, Ronnie?

10:43.933 --> 10:46.933
- Oh, yeah, I just wanted
some clarification

10:47.033 --> 10:49.233
on that marina project.

10:51.767 --> 10:52.900
- You seem nervous, Ronnie.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.133
There's sweat glistening
on your strong brow,

10:56.233 --> 10:58.467
supple checks are flushed.

10:58.567 --> 10:59.567
You alright?

10:59.667 --> 11:01.800
- Yeah, so I was wondering--

11:01.900 --> 11:03.900
- I decided to reward you.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.467
- Oh.

11:05.567 --> 11:10.600
- Leadership positions are not
for the soft and the weak.

11:10.700 --> 11:15.100
They're for the firm
and the hard, and that's you.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.900
So if you want it,

11:18.067 --> 11:23.067
the Trident Marina Project
is yours.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.733
- [woman singing]
- COY: Sign here.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.067
- Okay.
- And here.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.567
- Easy enough.
- And date up there.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.700
It's the 23rd.
- Okay.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.467
And initial.
- Alright.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.867
- Initial.
- Alright.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.567
- And sign.
- RONNIE: Okay.

11:43.533 --> 11:46.767
- *

11:56.433 --> 11:58.733
*

12:04.700 --> 12:06.933
- [toilet flushes]

12:07.067 --> 12:10.800
- *

12:18.633 --> 12:20.600
- Who are your bridesmaids?

12:20.700 --> 12:22.967
- Charlotte, my daughter,
and my friend, Kaitlynn.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.433
- And the groomsmen?

12:24.533 --> 12:26.133
- Well,
that's kind of a problem,

12:26.233 --> 12:27.733
because I don't have
any friends,

12:27.833 --> 12:30.667
'cause I'm kinda selfish,
hard to get along with.

12:30.767 --> 12:33.500
I bet I get called an [bleep]
four, five times a day minimum.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.767
- I'll just put undecided.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.633
- You know who we could
get is Vernon Brown.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.100
That son of a--
- Vernon Brown--

12:38.200 --> 12:39.700
- I'm writing undecided.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.500
- Okay, we're undecided.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.700
- Alright, let's do
the quick run-through, shall we?

12:47.733 --> 12:49.933
Ronnie, I need you to go on
down there by the altar,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.733
face back this way.

12:51.833 --> 12:55.167
Keep going, keep going,
keep going.

12:55.267 --> 12:57.133
Yes, great.
Now turn around and face back.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.067
Debboe, you'll be waiting
right there.

12:59.133 --> 13:03.233
We're gonna hear--
[humming "Wedding March]

13:03.333 --> 13:04.333
Cue bridesmaids.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.733
[humming continues]

13:05.833 --> 13:08.333
* And our beautiful
blushing bride *

13:08.433 --> 13:12.533
[humming continues]

13:14.700 --> 13:17.700
* And now face the groom *

13:20.067 --> 13:22.300
- I just flushed the wire.
I can't go through with it.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.467
You'll have to find
someone else.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.200
- You just destroyed
government property.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.233
We can add that to the charges
against you.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.267
- What--you got Coy all wrong.

13:29.367 --> 13:30.333
He's a good guy.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.067
- You're being naïve.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.267
Don't think for a minute
that he wouldn't turn you in

13:34.367 --> 13:35.667
to save his own ass.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.467
- I'll have to take my chances,
how 'bout that?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.067
Look, I gotta let you go.

13:39.133 --> 13:41.800
I got a wedding to plan.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.300
- [phone beeps]

13:45.100 --> 13:45.933
- [owl hoots]

13:46.067 --> 13:47.467
- I guess super strength.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.800
I mean, I would say
invisibility, but...

13:49.900 --> 13:52.900
I think I'd feel
like kind of a creep.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.400
- For me, it would be flight.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.633
Although I'd be afraid
of bird attacks.

13:57.733 --> 14:00.867
Birds really freak me out.
- Yeah.

14:00.967 --> 14:05.067
I once looked into the eyes
of blue jay, saw pure evil.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.933
- [machine humming]

14:07.067 --> 14:08.567
- Did you see that?

14:08.667 --> 14:09.967
- Yeah.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.833
- Walt, this is it.

14:11.933 --> 14:13.400
- [indistinct chatter]

14:13.500 --> 14:16.067
- It's a lot smaller
than I thought it'd be.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.600
They could be aliens.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.533
- *

14:27.067 --> 14:29.400
- Oh my God!

14:29.500 --> 14:32.867
- Oh, Leia, it's not
what it looks like.

14:32.967 --> 14:35.467
- You and your idiot friends
aren't using ropes and logs

14:35.567 --> 14:38.333
to make a fake crop circle
in the middle of a wheat field?

14:38.433 --> 14:40.633
- Okay, yes, it--that's
what it looks like.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.733
What are you doing with Walt?
What's this hankie-pankie?

14:42.833 --> 14:44.467
- Don't try to change
the subject, Reggie.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.333
You guys should be
ashamed of yourselves.

14:46.433 --> 14:47.833
You don't deserve the PMS
on your jacket.

14:47.933 --> 14:49.067
- I can explain.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.867
- I thought we were
gonna keep it a secret.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.767
- Damn it, Kenny, if there
weren't laws against it,

14:52.867 --> 14:55.467
I would rip your tongue
right out of your face.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.067
- Okay, let's hear it.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.500
- I did it for us.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.767
To get--Kenny, kill the drone!

15:01.867 --> 15:03.800
- But it looks really cool.
- Oh, geesh.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.833
- Oh us?

15:04.933 --> 15:06.733
- You see, my plan
was to get famous.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.300
And not like regionally famous.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.467
I mean, famous famous.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.533
I could have my own PMS show.

15:12.633 --> 15:16.633
I'd be like the Anthony Bourdain
of the paranormal world.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.900
There'd be sponsors and money.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.300
We could get a pool.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.567
Maybe even a Tesla.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.967
And we could finally see Epcot.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.167
Epcot, Leia.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.667
- Reggie!

15:28.767 --> 15:30.600
People who are pure of heart
don't investigate the unknown

15:30.700 --> 15:31.767
because they want fame.

15:31.867 --> 15:34.233
They do it
because they want to believe

15:34.333 --> 15:35.867
in something bigger
than themselves.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.300
Uh, mah! I can't even
look at you right now.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.300
- Right now.
But you can look at me later?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.867
- Uh, no.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.067
We are so broken up.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.233
- *

15:44.333 --> 15:46.067
- REGGIE: Le-Leia!

15:46.100 --> 15:48.600
- *

15:48.700 --> 15:51.667
- Does that mean
we're done for the night?

15:51.767 --> 15:53.733
- No. Let's just take
a quick coffee break.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.933
Yeah, we're done for the night!

15:56.067 --> 15:57.433
Stupid!

16:00.500 --> 16:01.633
- Vernon.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.067
I can't get it zipped.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.367
It's too tight.

16:04.467 --> 16:05.700
Can you go get the lady?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.367
- She's breaking up a fight
between two brides

16:07.467 --> 16:08.833
that wanted the same dress.

16:08.933 --> 16:10.967
I'll get it for ya.
- I don't know if it fits.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.567
- I got my eyes
closed, don't worry.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.800
- DEBBIE: I'm sweating.
I'm sorry.

16:13.900 --> 16:14.767
- I got it.

16:14.867 --> 16:18.067
- [zipper zips]
- There you go.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.267
- Oh my God.

16:19.367 --> 16:20.833
I'm embarrassed to come out.

16:20.933 --> 16:22.800
- Well, don't be, come on.
I've seen you naked.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.067
Let's do it.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.200
- *

16:25.300 --> 16:27.233
- Whoo, look at you!

16:27.333 --> 16:28.400
- Can you tell I'm pregnant?

16:28.500 --> 16:30.067
- [laughs] Not at all, baby,
not at all.

16:30.167 --> 16:30.933
That's our secret.

16:31.067 --> 16:33.100
- [laughs] Oh, yeah, big secret.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.133
- Yeah, uh-huh.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.667
- Is it too tight?

16:38.467 --> 16:40.067
- You look beautiful.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.567
- What are you doing?

16:47.667 --> 16:49.433
- Oh my God, Mom!

16:49.533 --> 16:51.100
You look amazing.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.133
- Doesn't she?

16:52.233 --> 16:54.133
- Oh my God, I love it.
- Thank you.

16:54.233 --> 16:57.367
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Uh, helping your mom.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.767
- Where's Ronnie?

16:58.867 --> 17:01.600
- *

17:01.700 --> 17:02.900
- Hold on there, Speedy.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.467
It's getting
dangerously close to a run.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.667
You in a hurry?

17:05.767 --> 17:07.900
- Yeah, I gotta get
to the tux shop by six,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.533
or Deb's gonna pull
my dolphin shorts over my head.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.067
- Plenty of time.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.800
And the night is young.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.400
Let's say we go
for a little drive?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.933
I got something
I wanna show you.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.933
- And it'll give you plenty
of time to explain where...

17:20.067 --> 17:22.633
this came from.

17:22.733 --> 17:23.800
Let's go, Ronnie.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.567
- Did you get that
out of the toilet?

17:25.667 --> 17:26.967
- Just get in the car, Ronnie.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.567
- COY: So, did you
enjoy the ride, Ronnie?

17:31.667 --> 17:34.967
That's the last drive
you'll ever take...

17:35.067 --> 17:37.967
uh...in this car.

17:38.067 --> 17:41.367
I'm trading it in on Tuesday
for a money-green Jag.

17:41.467 --> 17:42.400
Come on.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.533
- [whistling]

17:49.400 --> 17:50.733
- Oh, God, no, please, please.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.433
I can explain, please!

17:52.533 --> 17:54.067
Please, I'm sorry!

17:54.167 --> 17:55.100
- *

17:58.367 --> 18:00.933
- Please...I can explain.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.700
- Well, as titillating as it is

18:02.800 --> 18:06.900
to see you
on your knees begging...

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
we're not gonna kill you.

18:09.167 --> 18:11.600
- Wait, what?
We're not gonna kill him?

18:11.700 --> 18:12.733
You said I could murder him!

18:12.833 --> 18:14.333
It's the whole reason
I brought my OJs.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.500
- Well, I was joking.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
Can you imagine?

18:18.700 --> 18:20.400
- [bleep] I don't
even know why I came.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.367
- COY: Oh, stop pouting, Vance.

18:22.467 --> 18:23.467
Come on, get up.

18:23.567 --> 18:24.667
- Okay.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.633
- Look around.
What do you see?

18:26.733 --> 18:28.067
- Empty parking lot?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.100
- [sighs]

18:29.200 --> 18:30.733
- [slaps]

18:30.833 --> 18:32.233
- Over there.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.733
Funny, I see rows of slips
with 50-foot yachts.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.800
Welcome to Trident Marina.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.200
- There's nothing here.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.833
- Exactly.

18:41.933 --> 18:45.567
Guess who signed the documents
that said there was?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.933
- Me?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.933
- I'd think twice
about going to the FEDs.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.967
Beause you know
there will be consequences.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.767
Hey, Vance, what happened
to first time

18:53.867 --> 18:55.900
that you were disloyal?

18:56.067 --> 18:57.933
- You put a ribeye
down my pants,

18:58.067 --> 18:59.633
tied me to the fence
at a dog park.

18:59.733 --> 19:02.067
- [laughing] Yeah.

19:02.100 --> 19:08.067
Well, you know, just so that
we understands each other...

19:08.167 --> 19:09.767
give you some time
for reflection.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.233
Let's go!

19:11.333 --> 19:12.500
- But...

19:12.600 --> 19:14.067
- Don't move.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.400
- [door closes]
- Can I get a jacket?

19:19.500 --> 19:23.067
- *

19:23.167 --> 19:25.400
- VANCE: Murder ya later,
Ronnie.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.067
- *

19:37.733 --> 19:40.533
- Oh, Charlotte,
do you like it?

19:40.633 --> 19:42.567
- I guess it's not
entirely hideous.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.400
- Oh, it looks beautiful.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.300
- Babe, remember I told you
power walking

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
was harder than running?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.467
- Yeah.
- It's not true.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.133
- Oh, you ran for me?

19:54.233 --> 19:55.433
- Little bit.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.567
- Is this the groom?

19:58.667 --> 20:00.633
- Yep, that's Ronnie.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.767
- Okay.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.433
How 'bout we get you
some paper towels

20:04.533 --> 20:06.267
and you try this suit on?

20:09.567 --> 20:12.433
- *

20:16.067 --> 20:19.667
- So...you've been helping mom
all day with wedding stuff?

20:19.767 --> 20:22.333
- Yeah.

20:22.433 --> 20:23.733
I'm feeling kinda like
a third wheel,

20:23.833 --> 20:25.600
to be honest with ya.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.100
- You ever hear the saying,
"speak now

20:27.200 --> 20:30.567
or forever hold your peace"?

20:30.667 --> 20:32.333
- Yeah.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.133
I'll see ya in a little bit.

20:37.233 --> 20:39.433
- [sighs]

20:39.533 --> 20:41.000
- WALT: 1932 [unintelligible].

20:41.100 --> 20:43.567
1963, Sir Thomas Moore,
Wiltshire.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.300
1966, the--
- Walt, stop.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.000
I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

20:48.100 --> 20:49.333
but you don't have to list

20:49.433 --> 20:51.767
every unexplained crop circle
from the 16th century on.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.700
Reggie might be a total fraud,
but trust me,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.533
I'm still a believer.
- So am I.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.400
- I know.
That's what I love about--

21:00.167 --> 21:01.600
- That's what I love
about you, too.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.300
- *

21:04.400 --> 21:07.467
- We never ate
those sandwiches.

21:07.567 --> 21:11.200
- Walt...we've been
in the car for an hour.

21:11.300 --> 21:14.133
Do you wanna eat
the sandwiches inside?

21:14.233 --> 21:16.200
- Yeah.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.500
Yeah, I do.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.867
- Okay, me, too.

21:20.967 --> 21:21.833
- Doesn't he look handsome?

21:21.933 --> 21:24.067
- You know, he actually does.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.600
- RONNIE: Yeah, I know.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.633
Hey, babe, you know that whole
"for richer or poorer thing"?

21:28.733 --> 21:30.567
You're still cool
with that, right?

21:30.667 --> 21:31.967
- Of course I am.

21:32.067 --> 21:33.467
- RONNIE: Cool.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
- [whistling]

21:50.333 --> 21:54.333
- RONNIE: Guys,
really, I can explain.

21:54.433 --> 21:56.967
Please, please, I can explain.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.400
- COY: As titillating as it is

21:58.500 --> 22:01.433
to see you on your knees
begging--

22:01.533 --> 22:03.233
- * Say oh

22:03.333 --> 22:04.500
- [girl laughs]

22:07.400 --> 22:09.200
- *
