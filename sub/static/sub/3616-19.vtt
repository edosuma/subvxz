MY QUEEN, IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR TONIC.

00:42.501 --> 00:46.150
CAN YOU DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS THUNDER?

00:46.250 --> 00:48.192
'CAUSE IT IS
MAKING ME NUTS!

00:48.292 --> 00:50.442
I HAVE NO SWAY
OVER THE WEATHER.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.859
I DO HAVE A FRIEND
WHO WORKS WITH WIND,

00:52.959 --> 00:55.401
BUT SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

00:55.501 --> 00:57.109
WHAT ABOUT DEMONS?

00:57.209 --> 00:59.359
ANY SWAY OVER THEM?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.109
BECAUSE I SWEAR,
IF THEY DON'T SHUT UP...

01:01.209 --> 01:03.899

01:03.999 --> 01:05.066
UGH!

01:05.167 --> 01:06.317
I HATE THIS STUFF!

01:06.417 --> 01:07.899
IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.651
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO REGULAR OLD VITAMINS?

01:09.751 --> 01:12.275
THERE'S NOTHING REGULAR
ABOUT YOUR PREGNANCY.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.609
THE NEW POWER
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING

01:14.709 --> 01:17.484
IS A MERE SHADOW
OF WHAT'S TO COME.

01:17.584 --> 01:19.899
THE TONIC
STRENGTHENS YOU

01:19.999 --> 01:21.900
TO BEAR
THE WEIGHT OF IT.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.109
OK. WELL, THEN,
DO ME A FAVOR.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.526
FIND SOMETHING
THAT STRENGTHENS ME

01:25.626 --> 01:28.067
AND DOESN'T TASTE
LIKE CRAP.

ALL RIGHT?

THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO CONTINUE

01:48.999 --> 01:50.899
WITH THIS WORK AT ALL.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.983
I LIKE MY WORK.
IT'S A GOOD DISTRACTION.

01:53.083 --> 01:56.501
A DISTRACTION
FROM WHAT?

01:56.959 --> 01:58.999

DON'T GET ME WRONG--

02:05.542 --> 02:07.442
THIS WHOLE QUEEN THING
IS KIND OF FUN.

02:07.542 --> 02:09.899
IT'S JUST...

02:09.999 --> 02:10.899
YOUR SISTERS.

02:10.999 --> 02:13.359
YEAH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THEY HAVE TO BE SO STUBBORN,

02:13.459 --> 02:16.899
WHY THEY CAN'T JUST...
RESPECT MY DECISION.

02:16.999 --> 02:19.818
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
IN THE NATURE OF GOOD
TO COMPROMISE.

02:19.918 --> 02:22.983
THEY'LL NEVER
UNDERSTAND.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.899
THEY'LL ONLY WANT
TO CHANGE YOU BACK.

02:24.999 --> 02:27.192

A GREAT TASK--

I DON'T CARE!

02:47.834 --> 02:49.834
I WANT SOME ATTENTION
FROM MY HUSBAND.

WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CEREMONY.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.942
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

03:18.042 --> 03:19.959
ALMOST DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.983

ABOUT THIS.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.983
SORRY.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.083
IT'S HORMONES.

04:32.584 --> 04:36.234
DAMN IT! I HAVE READ
THROUGH THIS 15 TIMES.

THERE'S NOTHING EVEN
REMOTELY HELPFUL ABOUT
HOW TO SAVE PHOEBE.

04:38.999 --> 04:41.899
I TOLD YOU,
SHE MADE A CHOICE.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.859
THERE'S NO MAGICAL CURE
FOR THAT.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.734
YEAH, WELL, SHE'S
PREGNANT, PIPER,

04:45.834 --> 04:47.899

BEING INFLUENCED

04:47.999 --> 04:49.317
BY THE BABY INSIDE.

04:49.417 --> 04:50.567
AND WE COULD HAVE HELPED HER
OVERCOME THAT,

04:50.667 --> 04:53.401
BUT SHE CHOSE COLE.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.899
WILL YOU JUST STOP
WITH THE POTIONS
ALREADY?

04:54.999 --> 04:57.359

OVERRUN THE KITCHEN.

MY FREEZING POWER.

SO WE SHOULD ONLY USE IT
IN A DIRE EMERGENCY.

05:04.999 --> 05:08.025
NO.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.899
I WILL NOT SCALD

THEIR NEW QUEEN IS KILLING
UPPER-LEVEL DEMONS.

05:31.167 --> 05:33.692
WORD IS, SHE KILLED
2 JUST LAST NIGHT.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.899
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?

05:35.999 --> 05:37.913
IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE
PHOEBE'S WORKING FROM THE
INSIDE FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

05:37.923 --> 05:40.899
THAT'S GREAT!

05:40.999 --> 05:42.751
SINCE WHEN DO YOU GUYS
BELIEVE RUMORS

SINCE WHEN?

06:02.542 --> 06:04.899
SINCE I PUT 'EM
THERE.

06:04.999 --> 06:06.859

NOT KILL.

06:39.751 --> 06:41.542
ALTHOUGH, I'D KEEP
YOUR VOICES DOWN,
IF I WERE YOU.

HI, HONEY.

06:55.417 --> 06:58.626
HONEY?

06:58.918 --> 06:59.999
WILL YOUR FRIENDS BE
STAYING FOR DINNER?

07:02.667 --> 07:05.317
I'M GONNA FIND IT HARD ENOUGH
TO CONVINCE THEM TO STAY

07:05.417 --> 07:07.234
TILL THE END OF THE MEETING
UNLESS YOU STOP THREATENING
TO KILL THEM.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.317
I WAS KIDDING!

07:09.417 --> 07:10.734
YOU KILLED FIVE OF MY BEST
DEMONS THIS WEEK,

07:10.834 --> 07:12.899
SO FORGIVE ME
IF I'M MISSING THE JOKE.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.651
OH, BABY, I'M SORRY.

07:15.751 --> 07:17.317
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
WORKING A LOT,

07:17.417 --> 07:19.567
BUT THAT SHOULD
LIGHTEN UP SOON.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.609
IN THE MEANTIME...
NO MORE KILLING.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.567
UH-UH.

07:23.667 --> 07:24.609
PROMISE?

07:24.709 --> 07:25.900
PROMISE.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.234
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR THEM
TO ACCEPT THE FACT

07:27.334 --> 07:29.899
THAT MY QUEEN
IS A FORMER CHARMED ONE.

07:29.999 --> 07:32.334
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK
YOU'RE PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I SAID I PROMISE,

07:37.459 --> 07:38.900
BUT IF IT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER...HI!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.899
UM...I JUST WANNA SAY

07:40.999 --> 07:43.734
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY

07:43.834 --> 07:46.192
FOR KILLING YOUR
FRIENDS LAST NIGHT.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.776
[LAUGHS] OH, AND, UM,

07:47.876 --> 07:49.401
AND THE NIGHT
BEFORE THAT.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.983
AND IT'S NOTHING
PERSONAL, YOU KNOW.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.751
IT'S JUST, UH--AH--

07:54.584 --> 07:57.899

07:57.999 --> 07:59.000
CRAMP.

08:00.083 --> 08:03.234
I JUST NEED
TO LAY DOWN.

08:03.334 --> 08:06.317
SHOULD I CALL THE SEER?

08:06.417 --> 08:08.234
NO.

08:08.334 --> 08:09.626
NO, I'M FINE.

08:13.999 --> 08:17.109
WHERE WERE WE?

08:17.209 --> 08:18.899
Dane: GREGORY CONROY.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.818
MALLICK'S
IN FOR THE KILL.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.292
HE SPENDS HIS TIME
AT THE MISSION HILL
COMMUNITY CENTER.

08:42.292 --> 08:45.900
THESE ARE MEANT TO
SLOW AN ATTACKER DOWN,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.192
BUT NOT DO REAL
SERIOUS HARM.

08:48.292 --> 08:50.234
IT'S KINDA LIKE
MAGICAL MACE.

08:50.334 --> 08:51.899
SOUNDS REASONABLE,
I GUESS.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.275
THESE ARE
A LITTLE MORE LETHAL.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.150
EXPLOSIVES, PARALYTICS,

08:56.250 --> 08:57.526
YOUR GARDEN-VARIETY
POISONS...

08:57.626 --> 08:59.484
SO YOU'RE GONNA
POISON PHOEBE?

08:59.584 --> 09:00.900
LEO...

09:01.000 --> 09:02.526
SHE'S CARRYING THE SPAWN
OF THE SOURCE.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.899
SHE'S THROWING FIRE
FROM HER HANDS.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.609
IF SHE SHOWS UP HERE,

09:06.709 --> 09:08.776
WE'LL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
TO PROTECT OURSELVES.

09:08.876 --> 09:10.734
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GIVING HER A CHANCE.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.317
WE GAVE HER EVERY
CHANCE IN THE WORLD
TO COME BACK TO US,

09:13.417 --> 09:16.192
AND SHE THREW IT
IN OUR FACES.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.692
SHE CHOSE THE SOURCE
OF ALL EVIL

09:18.792 --> 09:20.859
OVER HER OWN FAMILY.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.751
SURPRISE!

09:25.709 --> 09:28.734
NICE TO SEE YOU,
TOO, PIPER.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.234
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:31.334 --> 09:33.150
OH...AND HERE
I THOUGHT

09:33.250 --> 09:35.401
YOU'D BE HAPPY
TO SEE ME.

09:35.501 --> 09:36.609
I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.651
PAIGE.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.651
WHAT?

09:39.751 --> 09:40.899
UNLESS YOU'RE HERE

09:40.999 --> 09:42.484
TO TELL US YOU
FILED FOR DIVORCE,

09:42.584 --> 09:43.776
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.567
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.995
FOR INSTANCE,
WE COULD TALK ABOUT
HOW...RIGID YOU ARE.

09:47.005 --> 09:49.899
IT'S REALLY NOT A VERY
ATTRACTIVE QUALITY.

09:49.999 --> 09:52.899
WAIT.

09:52.999 --> 09:54.501
PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

09:55.375 --> 09:56.501
I HAD A PREMONITION.

09:58.876 --> 10:00.899
WE HAVE AN INNOCENT
TO SAVE AND NOT
A LOT OF TIME.

10:00.999 --> 10:04.359
THAT IS SO GREAT.
LOOK, I TOLD YOU.

10:04.459 --> 10:06.818
DON'T GET EXCITED.
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU THINK.

10:06.918 --> 10:09.776
I HAVEN'T CHANGED
MY MIND. I'M NOT
LEAVING COLE,

10:09.876 --> 10:11.484
AND I'M NOT
RENOUNCING MY CROWN.

10:11.584 --> 10:14.109
IT'S JUST...

10:14.209 --> 10:15.942
I'VE NEVER IGNORED
A PREMONITION
IN MY LIFE,

10:16.042 --> 10:18.025
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO START NOW.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.067
UH...PHOEBE, YOU'RE EVIL.

10:20.167 --> 10:22.526
YOU'RE LIKE THE QUEEN
OF ALL EVIL--LITERALLY.

10:22.626 --> 10:24.899
THAT'S BESIDE
THE POINT.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.192
HOW CAN THAT BE
BESIDE THE POINT?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.899
I SAY WE DO IT.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.899
WHAT?

10:29.999 --> 10:31.876
EXCUSE ME.

10:32.918 --> 10:33.876
LOOK...THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN HOPING FOR,

10:36.667 --> 10:39.442
A SIGN THAT THERE'S
STILL GOOD IN HER.

10:39.542 --> 10:41.567
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE CARE
ABOUT SAVING AN INNOCENT?

10:41.667 --> 10:44.150
BECAUSE IT'S A TRAP.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.317
PIPER, THIS COULD
BE OUR ONLY CHANCE.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.876
I THINK PAIGE IS RIGHT.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.275
MAYBE BY HELPING HER
DO GOOD,

10:50.375 --> 10:52.709
IT MIGHT SWAY HER
BACK TO OUR SIDE.

10:56.584 --> 10:59.692
FINE.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.999
OK. YOU'RE ON.
WE'LL FOLLOW YOU.

11:05.918 --> 11:08.983
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

11:09.083 --> 11:11.375
INSURANCE.

11:17.709 --> 11:20.899
[GROANS] AGH!

11:20.999 --> 11:22.334
WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO
LAND IN THE MUD?

11:26.751 --> 11:30.526
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN HE'S GONNA
GET ATTACKED?

11:30.626 --> 11:32.667
I KNOW.

11:40.709 --> 11:43.876
HEY!

11:45.209 --> 11:48.484
NO, PIPER,
DON'T BLOW HIM UP!

11:48.584 --> 11:50.818
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:50.918 --> 11:52.542
STOP!

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
MY QUEEN.

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
LEAVE THAT INNOCENT
ALONE.

12:02.999 --> 12:04.083
GO.

12:11.667 --> 12:15.250
WHAT? HE'S...
ONE OF MY SUBJECTS.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.859
HOW--HOW--HOW
COULD YOU DO THAT?

12:26.959 --> 12:29.025
HOW COULD YOU JUST
LET HIM GO?

12:29.125 --> 12:30.899
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO UPSET.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.442
WE SAVED
THE INNOCENT,
DIDN'T WE?

12:32.542 --> 12:33.859
I CAN'T TALK TO HER.
YOU TALK TO HER.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.651
PHOEBE...

12:35.751 --> 12:37.037
THINGS ARE NOT
AS BLACK AND WHITE
AS THEY USED TO BE.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.899
OK? I CAN'T JUST
GO AROUND KILLING
DEMONS ANYMORE.

12:39.999 --> 12:43.317
WHY NOT? WE HEARD
YOU JUST KILLED TWO
LAST NIGHT.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.899
WELL, THAT WAS
DIFFERENT. HE WAS
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.651
I PROMISED COLE
I WOULDN'T KILL
ANYMORE.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.776
KILLING MALLICK
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A HUGE BETRAYAL.

12:50.876 --> 12:52.899
MALLICK? YOU'RE ON
A FIRST-NAME BASIS
WITH THE DEMONS?

12:52.999 --> 12:55.942
IF YOU WERE JUST GONNA
ORDER HIM TO STOP,

12:56.042 --> 12:57.942
YOU COULD HAVE
DONE THAT YOURSELF.
WHY COME TO US?

12:58.042 --> 12:59.899
BECAUSE I MISSED
YOU GUYS!

12:59.999 --> 13:01.900
OK?
IS THAT SO WRONG?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.025
I MISSED YOU.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.859
BUT, PHOEBE,

13:05.959 --> 13:07.370
YOU CAN'T BE THE
QUEEN OF THE UNDERWORLD
AND A CHARMED ONE.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.651
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS.

13:08.751 --> 13:10.567
WHY NOT?

13:10.667 --> 13:11.899
JUST BECAUSE
IT'S DIFFERENT

13:11.999 --> 13:13.275
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT IT CAN'T WORK.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.899
AND YOU ALL
MISS ME, TOO,

13:14.999 --> 13:17.025
EVEN THOUGH
I'M SURE PIPER

13:17.125 --> 13:18.942
PROBABLY DOESN'T
WANT TO ADMIT IT
TO HERSELF.

13:19.042 --> 13:20.899
OF COURSE
WE MISS YOU, HONEY.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.983
YOU CAN HAVE ME BACK.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.109
YOU CAN HAVE
THE POWER OF THREE BACK.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.899
YOU JUST
HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO MEET ME HALFWAY.

13:25.999 --> 13:28.234
PHOEBE, YOU CAN'T
PROTECT THE INNOCENT
AND SAVE DEMONS.

13:28.334 --> 13:31.899
IT JUST DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.234
APPARENTLY IT DOES.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.359
HE'S ALIVE,
ISN'T HE?

13:36.459 --> 13:37.899
YEAH, BUT YOUR
FRIEND MALLICK
IS GONNA COME BACK.

13:37.999 --> 13:41.109
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

13:41.209 --> 13:42.401
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO,
PHOEBE. THEY COME BACK.

13:42.501 --> 13:44.859
THEY SNARL AND COME BACK.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.567
AND NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT PROTECTING HIM

13:46.667 --> 13:48.899
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO SAVE YOU.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.899
YOU THINK
I NEED SAVING?

13:50.999 --> 13:52.776
ARE KIDDING ME?

13:52.876 --> 13:54.609
THAT BABY INSIDE YOU
HAS CORRUPTED YOU

13:54.709 --> 13:56.899
MORE THAN YOU THINK.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.150
[SCOFFS] PIPER...

13:58.250 --> 14:00.109
DON'T PIPER ME.
THIS IS INSANE.

14:00.209 --> 14:02.359
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
IS INSANE.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.734
YOU CANNOT COME BACK.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.109
YOU CANNOT WORK WITH US

14:06.209 --> 14:08.025
AS LONG AS YOU ARE
MARRIED TO THE SOURCE.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.484
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO,
LEAVE MY HUSBAND?

14:10.584 --> 14:12.899
YES!
THAT IS NOT FAIR!

14:12.999 --> 14:14.899
IT'S NOT FAIR, PHOEBE,
BUT YOU HAVE TO PICK A SIDE.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.275
GOOD OR EVIL.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.899
EVEN THOUGH IT MEANS
GIVING UP SOMEONE YOU LOVE,

14:19.999 --> 14:22.334
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.751
I'M REALLY SORRY
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

14:37.959 --> 14:41.025
I CAN'T DO THIS.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.959
WHAT ABOUT GREG?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.375
OH, NO, NOT AGAIN.

14:51.042 --> 14:54.734
DID YOU GUYS
SEE ANYBODY TAKE OFF

14:54.834 --> 14:56.900
ON A CHROME
AND ORANGE BICYCLE?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.899
NO. SORRY.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.834
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I BOTHER TO LOCK IT.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.526
UH...WHAT SHOULD
WE DO?

15:05.626 --> 15:07.167
FOLLOW HIM.

15:07.626 --> 15:08.709
DANE: THEY WERE
ANIMAL SACRIFICE CAVERNS.

15:11.459 --> 15:13.859
FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY'VE BEEN ABANDONED.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.567
[COLE SIGHS]

15:16.667 --> 15:17.859
WASTE OF SPACE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:17.959 --> 15:20.692
PUT A TEAM ON IT.
HAVE 'EM CLEANED OUT--

15:20.792 --> 15:22.776
MY LIEGE!

15:22.876 --> 15:23.899
STATE YOUR BUSINESS.

15:23.999 --> 15:24.942
I HAVE NEWS
FOR THE SOURCE.

15:25.042 --> 15:27.042
IT CONCERNS HIS QUEEN.

15:29.083 --> 15:29.999
WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SHE HURT?

15:32.751 --> 15:34.899
NO. THE CHARMED ONES
INTERFERED WITH MY KILL.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.899
I HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER MY IN-LAWS.

15:37.999 --> 15:40.442
IF YOU WANT THEM
OUT OF THE WAY,

15:40.542 --> 15:41.900
I SUGGEST
YOU TAKE BACK-UP.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.359
I MEAN ALL THREE
OF THEM,

15:43.459 --> 15:45.442
INCLUDING THE QUEEN.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.209
SHE ORDERED ME
NOT TO HARM THE INNOCENT.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.876
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15:56.918 --> 16:00.234
HAVE YOU TOLD
ANYONE ELSE?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.042
NO. I CAME
STRAIGHT TO YOU.

16:04.999 --> 16:08.234
THANK YOU.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.292
FOR YOUR LOYALTY.

16:24.375 --> 16:27.567
AM I NEXT?

16:27.667 --> 16:28.692
NO, DANE.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.899
YOU...

16:30.999 --> 16:32.899
I TRUST.

16:32.999 --> 16:33.983
IT'S JUST MY DAMN WIFE...

16:34.083 --> 16:36.275
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT...

16:36.375 --> 16:37.999
I THINK YOU BETTER
TAKE CARE OF THE INNOCENT

16:39.709 --> 16:42.542
BEFORE OTHERS HEAR OF THIS.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.899
MY LIEGE.

16:53.999 --> 16:55.792
GET UP.
I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

17:02.792 --> 17:06.526
Woman: THE ONLY REQUIREMENT
FOR MEMBERSHIP

17:06.626 --> 17:08.108
IS A DESIRE TO STOP
DRINKING.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.108
THERE ARE NO DUES
OR FEES FOR MEMBERSHIP.

17:10.209 --> 17:12.898
WE ARE SELF-SUPPORTING
THROUGH OUR OWN CONTRIBUTION.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.150
WE DO NOT WISH TO ENGAGE
IN ANY CONTROVERSY,

17:15.250 --> 17:17.108
NEITHER ENDORSE
NOR OPPOSE ANY CAUSES...

17:17.209 --> 17:18.898
YOU REALLY THINK
PIPER'S OK?

17:18.999 --> 17:20.483
I DON'T KNOW,

17:20.584 --> 17:21.993
BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD
THAT SHE'S FEELING
SOMETHING AGAIN.

17:22.003 --> 17:24.898
RIGHT.

17:24.999 --> 17:25.983
RIGHT, RIGHT.
SHE'S PROBABLY FINE.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.542
IS ANYONE CELEBRATING
30 DAYS TODAY?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.999
SO YOU THINK I JUST NEED TO
GIVE HER SOME SPACE, RIGHT?

17:34.709 --> 17:37.899
YOU COULD TRY THAT.

17:37.999 --> 17:40.317
IT'S JUST
WHEN PIPER LOST PRUE,

17:40.417 --> 17:42.899
SHE BARELY SURVIVED,

17:42.999 --> 17:45.025
AND IF SHE THINKS
SHE'S GONNA REALLY LOSE PHOEBE,
SHE MIGHT JUST...

17:45.125 --> 17:48.692
LISTEN, JUST GO
TALK TO HER, OK?

17:48.792 --> 17:50.526
REMIND HER WE HAVE
A DEMON TO FIGHT.

17:50.626 --> 17:52.776
THAT'LL DO HER GOOD
AND TAKE HER MIND
OFF PHOEBE.

17:52.876 --> 17:55.442
RIGHT, RIGHT.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.999
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

17:58.542 --> 17:59.899
ME? I'M FINE.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.662
I DON'T THINK MALLICK'S
GONNA ATTACK IN FRONT
OF ALL THESE PEOPLE,

18:01.672 --> 18:04.983
SO JUST GO GET PIPER
AND BRING HER BACK

18:05.083 --> 18:07.859
BEFORE THE MEETING'S
OVER, OK?

18:07.959 --> 18:09.999
OK. OK.

18:28.584 --> 18:31.899
WHERE'S THE REAL COLUMN?

18:31.999 --> 18:33.899
EXCUSE ME?

18:33.999 --> 18:35.234
THIS IS CUTE,
VERY CLEVER,

18:35.334 --> 18:37.359
AND I APPRECIATE
THE EVENING CHUCKLE,

18:37.459 --> 18:39.359
BUT I NEED TO SEE
THE REAL PAGES.

18:39.459 --> 18:41.334
ARE YOU CALLING
MY WRITING A JOKE?

18:42.667 --> 18:43.999
"DEAR BETRAYED,

18:45.999 --> 18:47.526
I SUGGEST YOU BEAT
YOUR CHEATING HUSBAND

18:47.626 --> 18:49.899
WITH HIS SECRETARY'S
STAPLER.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.899
THEN HE'LL THINK TWICE

18:51.999 --> 18:53.834
BEFORE BENDING HER OVER
HER DESK AGAIN."

18:53.999 --> 18:56.292
WELL...IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE HARSH,

18:57.751 --> 18:59.651
BUT I THINK
IT MAKES A POINT.

18:59.751 --> 19:01.734
WHAT IT MAKES IS A LAWSUIT!

19:01.834 --> 19:03.734
SO UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING
TO LOSE YOUR JOB--

19:03.834 --> 19:06.109
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

19:06.209 --> 19:08.025
I'M TELLING YOU
TO GET A SHRINK
IF YOU HAVE TO,

19:08.125 --> 19:11.651
BUT GET IT TOGETHER!

19:11.751 --> 19:13.999
REWRITE THAT COLUMN
AND DO IT FAST!

19:18.876 --> 19:21.999
EXCUSE ME?

19:30.918 --> 19:34.317
IF YOU WANT TO KILL
YOUR BOSS,

19:34.417 --> 19:36.834
WE HAVE PEOPLE
WHO CAN TAKE CARE
OF THAT FOR YOU.

19:37.999 --> 19:39.501
AREN'T YOU SWEET?

19:41.334 --> 19:43.667
TRUTH IS...

19:44.667 --> 19:46.025
SHE'S RIGHT.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.000
MY ADVICE WAS A LITTLE
OFF THIS WEEK.

19:50.584 --> 19:52.375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.000
YOU'RE QUEEN.

19:58.751 --> 20:00.317
AND YOU'RE CRANKY.

20:00.417 --> 20:01.692
I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT QUITTING
MY JOB.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.317
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR OTHER JOB?

20:04.417 --> 20:06.651
YOU GONNA
KEEP THAT, TOO?

20:06.751 --> 20:09.234
AND WHAT JOB
WOULD THAT BE, COLE?

20:09.334 --> 20:11.900
THE CHARMED ONE.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.734
MALLICK TOLD ME
WHAT YOU DID.

20:13.834 --> 20:16.192
SO WHAT? I LET HIM GO.

20:16.292 --> 20:18.609
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OK!

20:18.709 --> 20:19.692
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!

20:19.792 --> 20:21.751
THIS IS WHERE I WORK.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.542
YOU CAN'T SAVE
AN INNOCENT AND FREE
A DEMON, PHOEBE.

20:25.918 --> 20:28.651
IT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

20:28.751 --> 20:30.275
YOU SOUND LIKE PIPER.

20:30.375 --> 20:31.609
YEAH, WELL,
PIPER'S RIGHT.

20:31.709 --> 20:33.818
YOU MADE A CHOICE
WHEN YOU STOOD BY ME
AT THE CORONATION.

20:33.918 --> 20:36.317
IF YOU'RE QUESTIONING THAT,
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU WANT
TO BE WITH ME,

20:36.417 --> 20:38.442
YOU NEED TO LET ME KNOW!

20:38.542 --> 20:39.734
OF COURSE I WANT
TO BE WITH YOU.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.567
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO BE SO RIGID.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.818
BECAUSE I AM THE SOURCE!

20:43.918 --> 20:45.651
BECAUSE <i>YOU
</i> ARE MY QUEEN!

20:45.751 --> 20:47.150
BECAUSE THERE ARE
EXPECTATIONS!

20:47.250 --> 20:48.999
DO THINK I CARE
ABOUT ANYONE'S
EXPECTATIONS?

20:49.334 --> 20:52.899
THIS IS NOT A GAME,
PHOEBE.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.776
YOU WALKED THROUGH
A ONE-WAY DOOR.

20:55.876 --> 20:58.442
YOU TRY TO
TURN AROUND NOW,

20:58.542 --> 21:00.899
THEY WILL DESTROY US.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.234
WHO?

21:02.334 --> 21:03.942
MY SISTERS?

21:04.042 --> 21:05.734
THE UNDERWORLD.

21:05.834 --> 21:06.899
IF THEY THINK
WE'RE WORKING
BOTH SIDES,

21:06.999 --> 21:10.334
THEY WILL REVOLT.

21:10.999 --> 21:12.834
IF THEY DO THAT,

21:14.167 --> 21:15.899
IF THEY UNITE
AGAINST US...

21:15.999 --> 21:17.899
I PROMISE...

21:17.999 --> 21:20.918
WE WILL PRAY FOR DEATH.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.250
I'M SORRY, I--

21:25.125 --> 21:27.317
I DIDN'T KN--

21:27.417 --> 21:28.899
I GET IT, PHOEBE.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.899
BETTER THAN ANYONE,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.776
IT'LL RIP YOU APART
IF YOU LET IT.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.899
HOW DO I NOT LET IT?

21:36.999 --> 21:39.275
YOU MAKE A CHOICE,

21:39.375 --> 21:41.442
AND YOU STICK TO IT,

21:41.542 --> 21:43.526
EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD...

21:43.626 --> 21:45.999
EVEN THOUGH
IT MEANS GIVING UP
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

21:48.751 --> 21:49.209
LET'S GO HOME.

22:10.584 --> 22:13.859
WE'RE CLOSED.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.899
HONEY--

22:15.999 --> 22:17.542
I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.209
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING--

22:21.792 --> 22:23.567
EVEN MORE THAN
I DON'T WANT TO TALK...

22:23.667 --> 22:26.150
I DO NOT WANT A PEP TALK.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.150
PIPER.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:32.083 --> 22:34.192
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I AM DOING?

22:34.292 --> 22:36.899
I AM TRYING
TO STOP MYSELF

22:36.999 --> 22:38.899
FROM FEELING LIKE
THE FAILURE THAT I AM.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.899
YOU'RE NOT A FAILURE.

22:40.999 --> 22:43.234
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THAT PHOEBE--

22:43.334 --> 22:45.359
I AM THE OLDEST SISTER.

22:45.459 --> 22:46.942
IT IS MY JOB
TO KEEP THE FAMILY
TOGETHER,

22:47.042 --> 22:50.359
AND, SEE, AT THIS,
MY FRIEND...

22:50.459 --> 22:51.900
I AM A FAILURE.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.542
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.083
PAIGE COULD SEE
THAT COLE CLEARLY
HAD TURNED EVIL.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.999
AND SHE TRIED TO TELL ME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER

23:01.334 --> 23:04.899
AND OVER AND OVER...
AND OVER.

23:04.999 --> 23:08.734
THAT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND
LIKE A WORD ANYMORE.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.234
I DIDN'T SEE THAT
HE WAS EVIL, PIPER.

23:11.334 --> 23:13.899
PHOEBE DIDN'T SEE IT
AT FIRST.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.899
WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.899
WE WANTED A NORMAL,
HAPPY FAMILY.

23:17.999 --> 23:21.125
THAT'S JUST
HUMAN NATURE.

23:23.918 --> 23:27.150
SHE IS MY BABY SISTER...

23:27.250 --> 23:30.334
AND I LET HIM
DESTROY HER.

23:30.999 --> 23:33.000
THAT IS NOT
HUMAN NATURE.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.167
THAT IS THE NATURE
OF FAILURE.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.125
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GONNA
LISTEN TO THIS ANYMORE.

23:42.334 --> 23:44.359
YOU ARE A GOOD WITCH,
AND--

23:44.459 --> 23:46.626
I SAID...NO PEP TALKS!

23:48.667 --> 23:50.501
NOBODY LISTENS
AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

23:56.751 --> 23:59.959
OUCH.

24:04.626 --> 24:07.999
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.417
LEO!

24:25.999 --> 24:28.942
YOU AGAIN.

24:29.042 --> 24:31.609
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

24:31.709 --> 24:33.859
YES. STRANGELY, I AM,

24:33.959 --> 24:36.109
AND I WOULD LOVE
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU,

24:36.209 --> 24:39.125
BUT IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH BETTER IF WE COULD
TALK INSIDE BY THE CROWD.

24:41.999 --> 24:42.751
NO!

24:44.999 --> 24:45.999
WHAT THE HELL--

24:48.292 --> 24:49.459
LEO!

24:53.250 --> 24:56.626
<i>ATHAME!</i>

25:06.834 --> 25:10.334
DAMN IT,
WHERE ARE MY SISTERS?

25:17.292 --> 25:20.751
OH, MY GOD! PIPER!

25:32.792 --> 25:36.025
...AND A GOOD SISTER...

25:36.125 --> 25:37.526
EH--

25:37.626 --> 25:38.751
PAIGE, WHAT--

25:40.167 --> 25:42.234
[SIGHS] YOU WERE
FROZEN, LEO,

25:42.334 --> 25:44.109
AND I'M GUESSING
DEMONS DIDN'T GET HER.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.234
NO. MORE LIKE
INNER DEMONS.

25:46.334 --> 25:48.776
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE FROZE ME.

25:48.876 --> 25:51.150
YOU OK?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.484
BARELY. IT WAS
A DIFFERENT DEMON
THIS TIME.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.983
THEY REALLY
WANT THAT GUY DEAD.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.609
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HEAL HIM AND ORB HIM
SOMEWHERE SAFE.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.899
THEN WHAT?

25:58.999 --> 26:01.067
THEN I'M GONNA
PUT THIS FAMILY
BACK TOGETHER.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.776
CAN YOU HEAL PIPER?

26:03.876 --> 26:05.067
NO. I CAN'T HEAL
SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS.

26:05.167 --> 26:08.584
GREAT. DOWN I'M DOWN
2 SISTERS.

26:10.042 --> 26:10.834
AAH!

26:16.375 --> 26:19.567
MY QUEEN,

26:19.667 --> 26:21.999
IT IS TIME FOR YOUR TONIC.

26:22.501 --> 26:24.999
WHAT IF I PROMISE
NEVER TO SAVE ANY
INNOCENTS WITH THEM

26:26.584 --> 26:29.025
EVER AGAIN,
THEN CAN I SEE THEM?

26:29.125 --> 26:32.125
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
AFTER THIS.

26:38.751 --> 26:41.999
OH, MY GOD.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.942
IT'S POISON.
NO.

26:48.042 --> 26:49.776
YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS GOOD FOR ME.
IT IS.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.567
YOU'RE LYING!

26:51.667 --> 26:52.567
THINK ABOUT IT.

26:52.667 --> 26:53.776
LAST NIGHT,
YOU WERE STRONG.

26:53.876 --> 26:55.567
ANGRY, PERHAPS,

26:55.667 --> 26:56.776
BUT NOW LOOK AT YOU--
WHINING.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.609
IT'S A WEAKNESS
UNBEFITTING OF A QUEEN.

26:58.709 --> 27:01.899
WHAT'S IN IT?

27:01.999 --> 27:03.317
PURE EVIL.
THE BABY FEEDS ON IT.

27:03.417 --> 27:06.109
AND AS HE GROWS
STRONGER...

27:06.209 --> 27:08.776
I GET WEAKER.

27:08.876 --> 27:10.275
ONLY THE GOOD IN YOU.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.692
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DESTROY ME.

27:12.792 --> 27:13.942
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

27:14.042 --> 27:16.442
I GAVE YOU CLARITY

27:16.542 --> 27:18.818
WHERE NOW YOU HAVE
CONFUSION.

27:18.918 --> 27:20.999
I GAVE YOU CONVICTION
WHERE NOW YOU HAVE PAIN.

27:21.999 --> 27:24.125
YOU TOOK AWAY
MY WILL?

27:25.542 --> 27:27.542
NO. YOU MADE THE CHOICE
TO STAND BY YOUR HUSBAND
ALL ON YOUR OWN...

27:27.999 --> 27:31.192
FOR YOU, FOR COLE,

27:31.292 --> 27:33.250
AND FOR YOUR BABY.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.918
DON'T RISK
ALL OF YOUR LIVES

27:37.167 --> 27:38.983
BY QUESTIONING THAT
NOW.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.999
DRINK THE TONIC,
PHOEBE.

27:55.459 --> 27:59.584
WHAT GIVES YOU THE AUTHORITY
TO CALL A MEETING AND SUMMON ME?

27:59.999 --> 28:02.292
I SUMMONED YOU, MY LIEGE,

28:03.584 --> 28:05.275
BUT I DIDN'T CALL THIS MEETING.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.359
WE ALL DID.

28:07.459 --> 28:08.999
WELL, THEN SOMEONE
HAD BETTER SPEAK.

28:11.042 --> 28:14.317
THE CONCERN--

28:14.417 --> 28:15.417
SOMEONE ELSE.

28:17.501 --> 28:20.651
MALLICK IS MISSING,

28:20.751 --> 28:21.904
AND THE CHARMED ONES
ARE GUARDING HIS MARK.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.150
WORD ON THE STREET IS
THAT THE QUEEN WORKED
ALONGSIDE HER SISTERS

28:24.250 --> 28:27.042
TO INTERFERE
WITH THE KILL.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.083
I WONDER HOW
THAT NEWS SPREAD.

28:31.542 --> 28:34.250
FORGIVE OUR CONFUSION,
BUT WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION

28:34.999 --> 28:38.734
THAT THE POWER OF THREE
NO LONGER EXISTED.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.834
THE QUEEN IS PREGNANT.

28:41.751 --> 28:43.776
SHE'S PRONE
TO HORMONAL FITS.

28:43.876 --> 28:47.083
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU ALL
THAT THE POWER OF THREE

28:47.999 --> 28:51.334
IS INDEED EXTINCT.

28:53.959 --> 28:57.292
THEN WHO KILLED MALLICK?

28:59.083 --> 28:59.751
I DID.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.999
I WAS CONVINCED HE WAS
ABOUT TO BETRAY ME.

29:06.042 --> 29:07.899
NEVERTHELESS,
HIS MARK STILL LIVES?

29:07.999 --> 29:11.317
THEN ASSIGN SOMEONE
TO FINISH THE TASK, DANE.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.459
I BELIEVE YOU ALREADY
TRIED THAT, MY LIEGE.

29:14.999 --> 29:18.334
ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME?

29:23.999 --> 29:27.899
THE INNOCENT IS STILL
IN THE HANDS OF THE WITCHES.

29:27.999 --> 29:31.542
UNTIL WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE
THAT THE QUEEN'S...HORMONES

29:32.876 --> 29:36.150
ARE INDEED UNDER CONTROL,

29:36.250 --> 29:39.250
IT MIGHT BE BEST IF YOU
TOOK OUT THE MARK...PERSONALLY.

29:42.334 --> 29:44.334
FOR MORALE.

29:56.083 --> 29:59.859
HOW MANY HANGOVER CURES
DO YOU HAVE?

29:59.959 --> 30:02.109
A LOT.

30:02.209 --> 30:03.859
THERE WAS A TIME IN MY LIFE
WHEN I NEEDED THESE OFTEN.

30:03.959 --> 30:06.709
ACH...

30:08.709 --> 30:11.899
I'M SORRY, PAIGE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
GOT INTO ME.

30:11.999 --> 30:14.942
IT'S ONE THING WHEN
YOUR SISTER HAS A HUSBAND
THAT YOU CAN'T STAND.

30:15.042 --> 30:19.000
IT'S ANOTHER WHEN HE IS
THE SOURCE OF ALL EVIL.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.083
DRINK UP. WE GOT
SOME WORK TO DO.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.459
WE CAN'T LOSE HER.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.942
I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER SISTER.
I DON'T THINK I'LL SURVIVE IT.

30:29.042 --> 30:32.609
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

30:32.709 --> 30:34.899
PHOEBE WAS DIFFERENT TODAY.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.025
YEAH, SHE WAS NUTS.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.734
YEAH, BUT SHE CARED
ABOUT US, ABOUT GREG.

30:40.834 --> 30:43.417
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED,
AND I THINK NOW IS OUR
CHANCE TO GET HER BACK.

30:45.167 --> 30:46.792
HOW?

30:48.334 --> 30:49.818
I THINK WE STORM THE PENTHOUSE,
BRING THE CRYSTALS.

30:49.918 --> 30:52.899
WE STILL KNOW THE SPELL.

30:52.999 --> 30:54.412
WE VANQUISH THE SOURCE
THE SAME WAY WE DID
THE LAST TIME.

30:54.422 --> 30:56.317
YEAH, BUT NOW, THIS TIME,
THE SOURCE IS COLE.

30:56.417 --> 30:59.899
DO YOU REALLY
THINK SHE'S GONNA SAY
A LITTLE SPELL WITH US

30:59.999 --> 31:02.192
TO VANQUISH HIM?

31:02.292 --> 31:03.192
IF SHE DOESN'T, WE DIE.

31:03.292 --> 31:06.150
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE COMFORTING?

31:06.250 --> 31:08.651
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

31:08.751 --> 31:10.067
THE GOOD IN PHOEBE
IS FIGHTING TO THE SURFACE.

31:10.167 --> 31:13.275
WE SAW THAT TODAY.

31:13.375 --> 31:14.994
I DON'T THINK SHE'S JUST GONNA
STAND BY AND WATCH COLE KILL US.

31:15.004 --> 31:18.025
ARE YOU WILLING TO BET
YOUR LIFE ON THAT?

31:18.125 --> 31:20.584
AREN'T YOU?

31:22.792 --> 31:25.899
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
PRETTY AMAZING, PAIGE.

31:25.999 --> 31:29.275
I MEAN, A YEAR AGO,
YOU WERE AN ONLY CHILD.

31:29.375 --> 31:32.899
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE AGAIN.

31:32.999 --> 31:35.526
LET'S GO.

31:35.626 --> 31:36.792
THERE WE GO.

31:38.918 --> 31:40.999
I'LL GET THE CRYSTALS.

31:42.876 --> 31:46.834
COLE IS GONNA KILL GREG CONROY,
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

31:49.959 --> 31:51.167
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DO?

31:53.375 --> 31:55.417
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO
VANQUISH COLE.

32:02.042 --> 32:05.692
I KNEW IT. I KNEW
SHE WAS READY.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.983
WE HAVE TO USE GREG AS BAIT.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.983
BAIT? HE'S AN INNOCENT.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.192
I KNOW, BUT COLE'S
LOOKING FOR HIM.

32:12.292 --> 32:13.899
HE'LL FIND HIM WHEREVER HE IS,
SO HE'S SAFEST HERE.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.109
SO WE HAVE LEO
BRING GREG HERE,

32:17.209 --> 32:18.900
BUT THEN,
WHEN COLE ARRIVES,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.083
LEO'S GOTTA ORB GREG
OUTTA HERE.

32:21.375 --> 32:23.000
AND--AND WE
VANQUISH COLE.

32:24.999 --> 32:28.000
I'LL GET THE CRYSTALS.

32:29.334 --> 32:29.999
UHH, PHOEBE, UM...

32:32.999 --> 32:36.401
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE COLE.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.692
I'M REALLY--

32:38.792 --> 32:39.994
I CAN'T GET EMOTIONAL
ABOUT THIS NOW, PIPER.

32:40.004 --> 32:43.209
IF I DO, I WON'T BE ABLE
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.899
READY.

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
LEO, BRING GREG.

32:55.999 --> 32:59.918
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
TILL COLE GETS HERE?

33:01.999 --> 33:05.192
SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

33:05.292 --> 33:07.209
AAH!

33:28.876 --> 33:32.542
PHOEBE, WE HAVE TO--
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

33:34.459 --> 33:36.334
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE SEER'S TONIC?

33:38.334 --> 33:41.734
WHAT IT REALLY DOES?

33:41.834 --> 33:44.083
WHAT'S THIS?

33:44.542 --> 33:46.542
YOU PLANNING TO LEAVE ME?

33:47.999 --> 33:49.734
I WROTE TWO LETTERS.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.776
ONE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU,

33:52.876 --> 33:53.983
AND ONE SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO MY SISTERS.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.442
I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHICH ONE
I'M GONNA SEND.

33:56.542 --> 33:59.025
WELL, YOU BETTER DECIDE.
RIGHT NOW.

33:59.125 --> 34:01.899
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TONIC?

34:01.999 --> 34:03.275
YES.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.000
HUHH. SO YOU KNEW SHE WAS
POISONING ME WITH EVIL.

34:06.125 --> 34:10.250
YOU TOOK MY HAND
AND WALKED ME THROUGH
THAT CORONATION

34:11.792 --> 34:15.609
LONG BEFORE ANYBODY
GAVE YOU ANYTHING
TO DRINK.

34:15.708 --> 34:19.442
SO IF YOU WANNA PRETEND THAT
YOU'RE BEING POISONED--

34:19.542 --> 34:21.275
SO WHY EVEN BOTHER
WITH THE TONIC?

34:21.375 --> 34:23.442
WHY NOT JUST LET ME
THINK FOR MYSELF?

34:23.542 --> 34:25.525
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO HAVE GOOD AND EVIL
FIGHTING INSIDE YOU,

34:25.626 --> 34:27.942
RIPPING YOUR INSIDES OUT.

34:28.042 --> 34:29.150
I WANTED TO SAVE YOU
THAT PAIN.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.899
YOU SHOULD'VE TRUSTED ME...

34:30.998 --> 34:33.998
TO STAND BY YOU ALL ON MY OWN.

34:37.958 --> 34:41.208
SO, SHOW ME I CAN.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.167
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN
THE TONIC NOW.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.067
YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.792
DRINK IT.

34:50.998 --> 34:52.542
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.958
OH, COLE...

34:57.667 --> 35:00.109
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR GAMES, PHOEBE.

35:00.209 --> 35:02.999
JUST DRINK THE TONIC
OR LEAVE.

35:03.167 --> 35:06.234
NOW.

35:06.334 --> 35:07.609
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:07.709 --> 35:10.818
WHAT HAPPENED IS YOU HAD TO
GO AND PLAY DEMON CATCHER
WITH YOUR SISTERS.

35:10.918 --> 35:13.859
COLE, IT'S WHO I AM!

35:13.959 --> 35:15.776
AND NOW WE'RE IN DANGER.
SERIOUS DANGER.

35:15.876 --> 35:19.709
IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR LIFE...OR MINE

35:21.999 --> 35:25.192
OR THE BABY'S,

35:25.292 --> 35:26.776
WHAT ABOUT
PAIGE AND PIPER?

35:26.876 --> 35:29.109
DON'T YOU THREATEN THEM.

35:29.209 --> 35:31.150
I'M NOT.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.150
BUT IF THERE'S A COUP,

35:32.250 --> 35:34.192
DO YOU THINK WHOEVER
TAKES OVER FOR ME

35:34.292 --> 35:35.899
WILL LET THEM LIVE?

35:35.999 --> 35:37.417
WITHOUT THE POWER OF THREE,
THEY'RE SITTING DUCKS.

35:39.375 --> 35:41.375
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

35:42.959 --> 35:46.083
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

35:48.459 --> 35:51.876
THERE IS ONLY
ONE CHOICE.

35:52.999 --> 35:54.375
DRINK THE TONIC.

35:56.999 --> 35:58.125
YOU HAVE TO KNOW

36:00.250 --> 36:02.834
THAT I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.792
PLEASE?

36:08.209 --> 36:09.542
FOR US. FOR OUR SON.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.401
I LOVE YOU, PHOEBE.

36:31.501 --> 36:33.209
JUST REMEMBER,
WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.899
WE CAN HANDLE IT, AS LONG
AS WE STAY TOGETHER.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT?

36:42.292 --> 36:45.899
THE CONROY THING
GOT SERIOUS.

36:45.999 --> 36:47.899
I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.709
YOU KILLED HIM?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.899
IT WAS YOUR MESS. I WAS
JUST CLEANING IT UP.

36:52.999 --> 36:55.776
COLE, THEY'RE GONNA
COME AFTER YOU.

36:55.876 --> 36:57.899
THEY'RE GONNA COME HERE!

36:57.999 --> 36:59.234
IF THEY DO--

36:59.334 --> 37:01.250
NO.

37:01.417 --> 37:02.626
PHOEBE, IF IT COMES DOWN
TO THEM OR US--

37:05.125 --> 37:07.734
OH, GOD...

37:07.834 --> 37:09.334
PHOEBE, WAIT.

37:14.876 --> 37:18.292
PHOEBE...
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

37:19.042 --> 37:22.334
PHOEBE...

37:47.918 --> 37:51.250
YOU EVIL SON OF A BITCH.

37:54.292 --> 37:58.083
