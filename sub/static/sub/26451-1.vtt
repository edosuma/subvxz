03:48.603 --> 03:50.970
<i>Hey. Hey, Larry. Look,</i>

03:51.732 --> 03:53.439
I'm sorry I got behind.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.853
<i>You said that last month.</i>

03:56.194 --> 03:59.858
Well, business has been
slow this past year,

04:00.657 --> 04:03.900
but it's starting to pick up
and when I get back,

04:04.703 --> 04:07.821
I got at least three jobs lined up. So,

04:08.206 --> 04:10.352
why can't you just cut me some slack?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.208
<i>We did that last month
and the month before that.</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:15.911
<i>What can you pay me now?</i>

04:17.007 --> 04:18.168
Nothing.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.257
I'm tapped.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.419
<i>Well, I can't help you.</i>
Wait. Larry...

04:50.582 --> 04:52.118
Been a while, Joe.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.370
How's the business?
Just ring it up, Ricardo.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.384
Can I interest you
in our dessert cart?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.170
Keep the change.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.428
Hey!

05:50.058 --> 05:53.016
You don't understand.
We don't hurt women down south.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.848
No. Please, stop, stop!
You all right?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.726
No! Please, stop!
Next time,

05:59.067 --> 06:01.024
why don't you wrestle a man-gator?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.715
Stop! Oh, Shit!

06:05.574 --> 06:08.011
What did you do?
I saved you.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.763
No, you screwed it all up!

06:09.786 --> 06:12.198
Hey. Hey!

06:14.708 --> 06:18.522
Hey, buster, the state troopers are
coming, I'm gonna need you to explain

06:18.545 --> 06:20.107
what just happened.
Okay.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.876
Hello?
You hear me'?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.092
Speaking. Yes. Wha... When? What?

06:27.679 --> 06:29.074
Thank God. Thank you so much.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.431
Okay, I... I will be there
as soon as possible. Yes.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.414
My daughter's out of the coma,
but it's still touch and go.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.893
What? Coma?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.938
Hey, hey. Hey.
God...

06:40.525 --> 06:43.517
Wake up! Look,
want some no-drowsy?

06:44.321 --> 06:47.609
No. No, no. Caffeine
is a vasoconstrictor.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.482
Keeps the blood vessels
from opening back up.

06:56.958 --> 06:57.993
Do you have kids?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.705
Do I have kids?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.497
I don't know, a family?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.800
Wife and daughter. You like?

07:13.516 --> 07:16.554
Oh, beautiful.
Oops. They're dead.

07:17.854 --> 07:21.222
That's terrible. I mean, I'm sorry.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.006
Well, I... I have an 18-year-old daughter.
Her name is Billie,

07:26.029 --> 07:28.175
and this morning,
she had a terrible accident.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.446
I got the call, like,
an hour before you showed up.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.951
What the hell does that have
to do with getting strangled?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.647
Look, I don't expect you
to understand this, okay?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.412
But it was the only way
I could help my daughter.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.211
God, I'm so over this shit.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.406
I don't know, could you
give me a lift to Mobile?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.967
Is that a siren?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.058
That was a siren, wasn't it?

07:59.354 --> 08:00.469
I don't know.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.151
Billie is such a gearhead.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.355
Loves to ride.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.033
Says it's like flying. Dumb kid.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.396
When I heard that she was in a coma,

08:22.419 --> 08:25.207
I found that guy at the truck stop.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.526
Look, I understand
what this all feels like.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.529
I really do and I'm very sorry
about what happened to your daughter,

08:30.552 --> 08:33.030
but this strangling business is insane.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.408
You are aware of that, right?

08:34.431 --> 08:37.844
You think so?
Did I say something funny?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.352
I... I haven't even gotten
to the crazy part.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.722
Here it goes.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.357
When I was a teenager, I almost drowned.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.074
I was sliding on this frozen lake
with my friend and the ice broke.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.770
Seconds later, these guys
that were driving by the lake,

09:03.793 --> 09:05.579
they stopped and they pulled us out.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.631
You're saying you left your body?

09:20.769 --> 09:21.850
Yeah.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.685
I've done it a few times.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.772
Has to feel like I'm drowning,

09:31.196 --> 09:34.234
so I asked this boy who
I knew to choke me.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.695
He thought it was a sex thing.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.875
What did you mean when you said

09:47.337 --> 09:50.079
that I screwed things up back there?
What did that mean?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.666
It's okay, she found her
way back all by herself.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.713
How can you know that?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.616
How are you sure about
something like that?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.677
How can anybody be sure about
something like that? What if she didn't?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.017
I can't be sure,

10:05.522 --> 10:08.014
but it's exhausting
to leave my body, I don't...

10:08.316 --> 10:10.774
I'm not sure I could
do it twice in a day.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.859
You know, I was only trying
to help back there.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.282
I know.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.414
Thanks.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.485
Who knows what is really possible?

10:33.508 --> 10:35.795
If you could save somebody
like that, that would...

10:37.929 --> 10:39.090
be a miracle.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.601
Hey, Mama.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.735
How are you doing? Mama's here.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.484
Who's that?

11:03.246 --> 11:04.281
Oh.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.868
That's Joe. He's my friend.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.755
Mama...

11:15.216 --> 11:17.628
I don't know what happened...

11:18.511 --> 11:20.502
...but I don't wanna go back there.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.288
Why is she...
Ma'am.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.332
Gonna ask you to step outside.
Get the crash cart!

11:29.355 --> 11:31.084
I don't...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.044
Excuse me. I need to
get through, please.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.985
Come with me, please.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.866
Maybe here. Okay?

11:50.084 --> 11:53.293
It's okay, it's just...
Can we... Can you do it?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.455
Do it?
Now. Please.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.821
It's just I... I don't
have a lot of time.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.865
I can bring her back,
but I need your help.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.879
Okay? Please.

12:07.685 --> 12:11.724
You'll be fine, okay? Just do it, okay?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.392
Okay?

12:17.946 --> 12:18.856
Clear.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.600
<i>You know what I remember most?</i>

12:28.623 --> 12:32.229
<i>Is that when he left,
he walked all the way out to his car</i>

12:32.252 --> 12:34.773
<i>without ever looking back.
Not once.</i>

12:34.796 --> 12:37.538
<i>Now, you do not know
your daughter, do you?</i>

12:37.966 --> 12:39.081
No.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.805
Are you okay? Did it work?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.558
I don't know.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.315
Is she okay?
She's stable. You did good.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.650
She's back where she belongs.
She will not leave again.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.823
Thanks for looking after her.

13:07.161 --> 13:11.029
Keep an eye on her.
She has been to the other side.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.909
Okay.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.058
Julie, do you want some coffee?
No, that's all right, thanks.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.837
That's right. Caffeine's a...

13:38.860 --> 13:40.897
...con... Constrictor.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.316
Ah.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.622
So, when you go to the other side...

13:56.002 --> 13:57.993
do you just see people you know...

13:58.838 --> 14:00.624
or are there other people there?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.126
Um...

14:03.343 --> 14:04.549
Sometimes.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.240
I mean, can you talk to them?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.994
I mean, can...
Can you give someone a message?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.883
Did I do something wrong?

14:14.520 --> 14:17.262
No, no, I just... I
just have a headache.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.228
I'm just tired, and I've never
done it twice in one day.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.230
Actually, I... I might just
lie down for a minute.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.234
Do you want me to stay here?
I can let you know if she wakes up.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.286
Really? You don't have to go?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.852
Well, I have to get the load to Biloxi,

14:35.875 --> 14:38.867
but I can stay a couple hours
and still get there by noon.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.755
Uh, wow. That... That's so nice.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.209
Uh, that would be awesome.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.127
Cool.
Thanks.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.716
Well, I'll let you rest.
Thanks.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.587
<i>Why do you leave me alone?
You know I don't do good alone.</i>

15:02.610 --> 15:03.755
<i>I don't want to,</i>

15:03.778 --> 15:07.146
<i>but you married a truck driver.
What can I do?</i>

15:07.407 --> 15:09.569
<i>Don't you ever
leave me alone again.</i>

15:13.704 --> 15:16.810
Hey, Julie, we came to see
how Billie's doing, but, um...

15:16.833 --> 15:17.994
They said, "Just family."

15:18.709 --> 15:20.165
Is she okay? How is she?

15:20.878 --> 15:21.993
How is she?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.485
She's in a hospital!
How do you think she is, you moron?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.839
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.468
She could've died. You
all could've died!

15:32.140 --> 15:35.678
You know what? Get the fuck out of here!
Get out of my face.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.880
<i>It's gonna be
different, right, Joe?</i>

15:45.903 --> 15:47.519
<i>It's gonna be different.</i>

15:47.822 --> 15:51.907
<i>We can rebuild,
we can make up for lost time.</i>

15:52.368 --> 15:56.236
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.709
I'm a friend of your mother's, Joe.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.790
Remember?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.342
Of course I remember.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.223
I'm gonna get your mom.
No.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.392
Wait a minute.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.474
Yes?
Just...

16:22.940 --> 16:24.556
I just wanna look at you.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.359
Okay.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.770
It's been forever.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.106
Okay.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.406
I'm gonna let your mom
know you're awake.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.200
Don't be gone too long.

16:40.917 --> 16:41.998
I won't.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.006
Julie. Julie.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.844
Billie's awake.
Oh, okay.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.517
How is she?
She's good.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.236
Mom?
Yeah.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.491
How do you feel? Did you see the doctor?
How long was I asleep?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.121
I...

17:27.880 --> 17:28.995
I'm okay.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.331
It's just...

17:32.927 --> 17:34.383
It's so bright in here.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.213
Oh, God, I was so scared.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.562
You're still here.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.546
I... I can go.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.730
No.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.654
Just thought I dreamt you.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.535
So bright.

18:07.295 --> 18:11.539
Do you want me to get the nurse?
No. Don't leave me alone.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.091
I don't do good on my own.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.507
No, no. I... I won't go anywhere.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.608
That's me.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.113
Why don't you come in
for a cup of coffee?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.366
It's still a long haul to Biloxi.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.748
<i>I missed you, Majors.
Hey.</i>

18:55.259 --> 18:57.876
<i>It's all I ever did.
You were gone so much.</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:01.721
<i>Just sit in that
house and miss you.</i>

19:02.516 --> 19:06.475
<i>I told you that I'm not good on my own.
Not with our child...</i>

19:08.022 --> 19:09.433
<i>not with myself.</i>

19:11.776 --> 19:13.562
<i>It was dangerous to do that.</i>

19:15.780 --> 19:17.691
Oh, man!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.611
Oh, shit. Sorry.
Coffee.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.029
Smells good.
Right.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.778
No, no. If I drink that,

19:36.801 --> 19:39.489
I'm so tired, I'll never make it
out the door, let alone Biloxi.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.823
Just a little bit.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.928
You deserve it. Just a little.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.599
Cheers.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.857
You're a strange bird.
Where are you from?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.279
Uh, multiple places.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.702
And somehow you...

20:08.082 --> 20:09.197
showed up tonight.

20:14.839 --> 20:15.954
You know...

20:17.091 --> 20:18.422
without your help...

20:19.343 --> 20:20.959
my daughter would be gone now.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.595
No, I didn't do anything.
Yes, you did.

20:28.686 --> 20:29.831
You're a good man.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.983
I... I smell like three
days on the road.

20:37.945 --> 20:38.881
I like it.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.030
You know, I haven't...

20:46.746 --> 20:50.476
I haven't really been with anyone
since my wife and daughter...

20:50.499 --> 20:51.728
You know, I...
Right.

20:51.751 --> 20:56.245
I don't even remember
how to have sex. Sex.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.942
Well, I remember.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.277
I can show you.
You remember?

20:59.300 --> 21:02.338
Oh, really? You wanna have sex? Hmm?

21:02.887 --> 21:04.532
I was...
We can stop right now.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.950
No.
Are you sure?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.463
I don't think that's necessary.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.583
Okay.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.489
So, how did a nice German gal like you

21:44.512 --> 21:47.470
wind up in the US of
A, driving a big rig?

21:49.141 --> 21:52.224
I, um... I married a marine in Germany.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.722
His name was Chuck and, urn...

21:58.984 --> 22:00.395
we came here and...

22:01.278 --> 22:03.565
moved all over. I liked it.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.027
Billie was born and...

22:08.536 --> 22:09.742
life was great.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.934
And then he got sent to Iraq
and Afghanistan.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.073
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.828
And when he came back,
he didn't really, you know...

22:21.215 --> 22:22.705
until he left for good.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.091
Why?

22:27.221 --> 22:28.632
It was all my fault. I...

22:28.973 --> 22:30.680
I shouldn't have told him about my...

22:30.933 --> 22:32.014
Ability?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.183
Yeah, he, um...

22:35.771 --> 22:38.209
wanted me to look for his friends
and I did,

22:38.232 --> 22:40.599
but I couldn't... I couldn't find them.

22:42.444 --> 22:46.563
And it didn't matter anymore at some point
because he started seeing them himself.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.023
That's when he left.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.720
I'm so tired.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.430
Where's your room? Where's her room'?

23:32.453 --> 23:33.784
Down the hall, on the right.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.084
You know, the more you rest,
the more you'll heal.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.627
And the more you heal,

23:48.302 --> 23:50.339
uh, the better you'll feel.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.036
So, eat your beans with every meal.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.181
I'm sorry, I thought we were
doing a rhyming thing.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.879
Let us know if you need anything.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.108
Don't leave me.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.901
You're always leaving me,
and I don't do well on my own.

24:12.910 --> 24:13.945
Sorry?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.493
No kiss goodbye?

24:22.044 --> 24:23.409
Try and get some rest.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.097
She's in bed.
Thanks.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.686
All that?
I know.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.349
It... It will be hard to keep it
all straight, like,

24:46.694 --> 24:49.674
what's she taking and how many
and when, you know?

24:51.031 --> 24:53.010
After three days of sleeping in a chair,

24:53.033 --> 24:57.556
I don't have enough brain to even
deal with one of these child-proof caps.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.410
I'm sorry.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.210
I'm okay.

25:09.133 --> 25:13.197
Thank you, Joe, for everything you did.
I couldn't have done it without you.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.866
Yes, ma'am, I'm very glad I could help.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.995
You really went out of your way
to help us, you know.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.179
Nobody does that.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.207
We don't have family here.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.688
You know how hard it is
to be on the road and...

25:26.233 --> 25:27.712
try to make a living.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.339
Well, I don't know much
about raising children,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.228
but it looks like you've done a...

25:33.157 --> 25:34.522
A good job.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.155
I don't know.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.768
I wish I would've been here more.
You know, kept an eye on her.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.159
Maybe she would be taking
college classes now,

25:46.628 --> 25:48.649
instead of racing with those idiots.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.958
She's a kid.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.528
You have to make stupid mistakes
when you're young,

25:52.551 --> 25:55.043
otherwise you won't regret anything
when you're old.

25:55.596 --> 25:59.368
That sounds terrible, like one of those
inspirational cat posters.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.473
That's how I let myself off the hook.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.469
I just feel like this accident
was my fault.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.668
If I had been around more,

26:07.691 --> 26:09.932
she wouldn't have fucked off
with the wrong crowd.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.855
Baby»-

26:15.532 --> 26:17.511
you do what you have to do.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.116
Working's not optional.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.659
Hmm?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.408
Mmm.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.644
Mmm.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.354
Can you stay a little bit longer?

26:27.377 --> 26:30.586
I'd love to, but I really gotta get
the load to Biloxi.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.299
I'm already three days behind schedule.
They're gonna kill me.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.210
I'm sorry.
No, no.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.993
No, it's not your fault. I mean, I...

26:41.016 --> 26:42.870
I know what you were going through.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.476
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.804
But you brought her back.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.754
Yeah, just... Just being
a tiny little part

26:51.777 --> 26:55.941
of that makes everything feel
a little less dark.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.904
Hold me, baby.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.074
Mmm.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.151
Hold daddy tight.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.327
Well, I really gotta hit the road.
Okay.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.497
I'll check in on you
when I'm heading back, okay?

27:10.879 --> 27:11.914
Okay.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.373
Get out of here.
Giddy up.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.558
<i>So, you're not gonna pay me?</i>

27:26.019 --> 27:29.102
Yeah, I'm gonna pay you,
what you got coming

27:29.439 --> 27:32.419
minus the late penalties.
That's dog shit.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.879
That's not even bullshit.
Look...

27:33.902 --> 27:37.007
That's just dog shit.
You have been a boil on my ass

27:37.030 --> 27:38.843
ever since you walked in this door.

27:38.866 --> 27:42.450
My company says I gotta pay you
18 dollars and 46 cents,

27:43.203 --> 27:44.534
so I tell you what...

27:46.123 --> 27:47.284
keep the change.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.187
Hey, Joe.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.747
Joe, man, come outside.
They're taking your truck.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.286
What the hell are you doing, huh?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.538
All right.
Okay, here we go.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.665
This is where I say,
"I wouldn't do that."

28:09.688 --> 28:11.208
You ignore me and then my partner here,

28:11.231 --> 28:13.419
he hits you so hard,
we gotta contact next of kin.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.480
All right. Can you just...
All right, just... Just hear me out.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.133
There was an accident, okay?

28:19.156 --> 28:21.677
This woman, her daughter was in a coma

28:21.700 --> 28:24.221
and I had to drive her
to a hospital in Mobile,

28:24.244 --> 28:27.282
so just have a heart, kindness, charity.
Sure.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.831
Well, that's a very elaborate
sob story there, buddy.

28:31.293 --> 28:34.285
You should sell that shit to Telenovela.
You're gonna take my truck?

28:35.339 --> 28:38.297
A man without a truck isn't a man.
You know that, right?

28:38.717 --> 28:41.071
I'm taking your truck. Sorry, buddy.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.032
At least... Just... Okay, just let me...

28:43.055 --> 28:45.701
Let me get my personal belongings,
in the box.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.805
Can I get that?

28:47.100 --> 28:51.749
No. First, you pay your past due,
then you square up with Larry,

28:51.772 --> 28:54.605
then, maybe, you get your truck back.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.841
Hi.
Hey.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.100
Hey.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.436
We came to see how Billie's doing.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.605
Billie's okay,

29:37.025 --> 29:40.256
for a girl that almost got killed
in a terrible wreck.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.943
I know, right? I'm surprised she's not
smeared all over the highway.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.190
She fell in with the wrong crowd.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.484
Bunch of assholes.
She means us, Rick.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.781
Oh, really?

29:51.498 --> 29:56.772
I mean, we kinda suck, but I don't think
we're, like, that influential...

29:56.795 --> 30:00.129
Look, I'm sorry. It kills me
what happened to Billie...

30:01.133 --> 30:02.403
but it was an accident.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.416
It wasn't anyone's fault.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.384
Really?

30:05.887 --> 30:08.409
We try to watch out for her,
for each other.

30:08.432 --> 30:10.173
But you can't keep up with Billie.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.592
Not on a motorcycle, nobody can.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.021
Say hi. Take her lunch.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.026
Not while she's on real drugs.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.323
Hey.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.572
Hungry?

30:41.798 --> 30:44.460
You're lucky.
Really lucky.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.284
What do you remember about the accident?

30:50.307 --> 30:51.468
<i>Not much.</i>

30:53.727 --> 30:55.372
I remember after...

30:58.857 --> 31:02.600
...but before, not much.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.277
What about getting on the highway?

31:06.323 --> 31:07.358
Nope.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.488
Do you remember anything
before the accident?

31:12.913 --> 31:15.450
Not really.
Really?

31:17.084 --> 31:19.951
Do you have amnesia or...
What did the doctor say?

31:21.755 --> 31:22.961
I don't remember.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.431
Hello?
Hey, how're you doing?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.650
I've been okay. What about you?

31:46.530 --> 31:47.816
How's Billie?

31:49.324 --> 31:50.610
She seems better.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.735
Do you need some help?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.954
Let's just say that would not suck,
at all.

32:02.504 --> 32:03.619
<i>Everything all right?</i>

32:04.965 --> 32:06.171
Well, um...

32:08.051 --> 32:09.196
Well...

32:09.219 --> 32:10.880
<i>Why don't you come
and stay with us?</i>

32:11.972 --> 32:15.135
I could use the help, the company.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.183
<i>Okay?</i>

32:18.895 --> 32:21.057
Thanks, Julie. That... That's a...

32:21.815 --> 32:23.522
That's a real big help right now.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.021
Okay.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.567
See you soon.
Bye.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.363
Nobody has this many friends.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.786
You're texting your friends?

32:44.546 --> 32:46.316
Look, I don't mind waiting on you,

32:46.339 --> 32:49.570
but maybe you could, uh,
pick up the trash, huh?

32:49.593 --> 32:51.864
It's right here. Right here.

32:51.887 --> 32:52.922
Yep.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.015
What do you want?

33:04.733 --> 33:05.973
I don't know.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.146
I want you to be my Billie again.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.737
You know, help like you used to.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.904
We are a team, remember?

33:16.786 --> 33:18.777
We have so much to be thankful for.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.747
Yeah, you're right.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.914
I thought I lost you.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.251
You're all I have.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.585
I don't know what I
would do without you.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.468
Hey, I'm back.
Hey.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.141
You're in a good mood.
Well, I'm happy to be back.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.952
Yeah, come on in.
All right.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.564
What do you got to drink?

34:07.587 --> 34:10.275
A beer?
No, I like bourbon.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.400
On.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.166
Everybody asleep? I'm just playin'.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.139
How're you doin'? I missed you.
I'm great.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.331
You know I missed you? I missed you.
I missed you. Yeah.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.016
Roll in, roll in, roll in.
No, I said, roll in.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.899
Yeah. We're, like, falling now.
Roll this way. In, in, in.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.341
Whoo!

34:39.411 --> 34:42.072
Mmm. Beautiful weed.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.538
Yeah, it should be. I...

34:46.458 --> 34:49.996
I took it from Billie's friend
and Mike is a dope dealer.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.047
You know what I mean?
Billie... Billie's good?

34:54.384 --> 34:56.321
Huh?
Billie's good?

34:56.344 --> 34:59.928
Yeah, you know, she's getting better,
like, physically.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.090
But, um, I don't know, she, um...

35:03.727 --> 35:06.290
She's not really her old self, you know.
I don't know.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.474
Mmm.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.295
Well, she did take a pretty good
knock on the head.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.881
Wait, what? What?
I don't know.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.487
What?

35:18.325 --> 35:19.553
It's so wrong.
I mean...

35:19.576 --> 35:20.971
It's so wrong.
You don't just...

35:20.994 --> 35:22.306
You don't...

35:22.329 --> 35:25.183
You don't just recover from something
like that and bounce back,

35:25.206 --> 35:27.538
even if she is a teenager.
Right.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.816
Well, I think that you think
that I'm overthinking it,

35:32.839 --> 35:35.877
but you didn't know her before.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.864
Uh, no, no.
No.

35:38.887 --> 35:42.492
According to her,
we're old buddies, and that's weird.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.994
Well...

35:44.017 --> 35:47.164
Don't be surprised if she's
making goo-goo eyes at you

35:47.187 --> 35:50.584
just to piss me off.
Goo-goo eyes.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.099
You know, you know what that looks like.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.408
Shh, shh.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.434
Shh.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.744
Goo-goo eye...

36:10.251 --> 36:12.743
So, where am I slee...
Where am I sleeping tonight?

36:14.047 --> 36:16.109
Where am I sleeping? Where am I...

36:16.132 --> 36:18.043
On the couch.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.698
On the what?
On the couch.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.679
Ca-ouch! That hurts.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.384
Well, I, um...

36:29.062 --> 36:33.710
My daughter's at home
and I never bring men here.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.128
No, I... I understand.
Okay.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.607
She, uh... She asleep?

36:39.364 --> 36:40.320
Um...

36:40.907 --> 36:45.263
Yeah, she took, like, a Percocet
or two, like, three hours ago.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.183
She'd be sleeping longer.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.571
I should probably

36:50.041 --> 36:53.522
start hitting the couch then.
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.107
Well, I hope you don't mind, I...

36:55.130 --> 36:58.122
I like to sleep in the nude.
I hope that's not a problem.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.405
That a problem?
That's actually a huge problem.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.782
Why is that?
That's a huge problem, like,

37:03.805 --> 37:06.076
this is just a huge problem.
It's a problem?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.840
Just relax, just relax.
I don't know.

37:09.477 --> 37:13.311
You're too loud. You're so loud...
Don't yell. You're yelling.

37:14.107 --> 37:17.003
Do you remember that movie, <i>The Exorcist?</i>
The movie, <i>Exorcist.</i>

37:17.026 --> 37:19.005
You remember Linda Blair
when she had the crucifix?

37:19.028 --> 37:21.258
Who?
She went, "Fuck me! Fuck me!"

37:21.281 --> 37:23.593
Shh.
Fuck me! Say it like her.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.221
Fuck me! Say, "Fuck me."
Okay, okay. Yeah, I am.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.985
Shh.

37:29.789 --> 37:33.103
Fuck me! Can you do it like Linda Blair?
Fuck me! Say it.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.084
Woohoo!
Too loud. You're too loud.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.845
I'm really working it up here.
I know you don't see me, but...

37:50.477 --> 37:52.809
Yeah, awesome. Like what would...
What would we see?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.723
I feel like getting
some air conditioning.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.838
Air conditioning?

37:59.861 --> 38:01.465
I feel like some
air conditioning

38:01.488 --> 38:03.633
and watching a movie in the dark.
Okay.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.470
Ow!
Oops.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.971
Sorry.
What's... What's the deal?

38:07.994 --> 38:10.281
Are you mad at me or
are you just clumsy?

38:10.497 --> 38:12.704
I'm sorry. You're making me nervous.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.662
You all right? Sorry.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.565
Well, she ought to make it to Memphis.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.874
That's awesome.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.458
Is it gonna make it back?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.957
Ha! Ha! Ha!

39:48.052 --> 39:49.542
I take that as a yes.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.691
Do you want a beer?
Yeah, that'd be great.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.370
I'm gonna drain the main vein.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.963
So, do you want a beer?

40:46.986 --> 40:49.068
Does the Tin Man have
a sheet metal cock?

40:52.033 --> 40:53.865
Hey, baby. Do you need anything?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.075
Not yet.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.145
You guys, this is... This is good.

41:02.168 --> 41:06.503
This is... I like this.
So nice to have you guys here. Love it.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.615
<i>The animal's
instincts in killing</i>

41:13.638 --> 41:17.243
<i>often mimic their sexual behavior,
which could become violent,</i>

41:17.266 --> 41:20.804
<i>sometimes resulting in injury
or death to the female partner.</i>

41:26.109 --> 41:29.693
<i>This is all part of survival
in the animal kingdom.</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:35.199
Hey, Billie. Can you help me?

41:38.871 --> 41:40.892
Billie, come help me.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.622
What?

41:45.503 --> 41:47.710
Can you help me?
I'm sick.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.962
What's going on? Are you okay?

41:56.014 --> 41:59.928
I felt dizzy when I stood up,
so I'm just gonna sit here for a while.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.600
I can help.
That's okay.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.334
Are you guys okay with okra?
Man, okra's real nice.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.768
I hate okra.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.522
Since when?
Since always.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.526
Just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.903
Apparently, you're done with that now.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.144
Hey, no fixing that.
She's not riding anymore.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.283
You want it in selling condition,
don't you?

42:27.462 --> 42:29.703
I hope you didn't
ask Joe to fix your bike.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.710
Didn't have to. He offered.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.043
That's nice.
It is.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.716
You should ask him to stay.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.162
You're not good on your own.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.051
What are you talking about?

42:46.022 --> 42:47.933
I remember when Dad left.

42:50.026 --> 42:53.564
It was nighttime, but I was still awake.

42:55.782 --> 42:58.820
You were crying, I was crying.

43:00.036 --> 43:01.822
And it was raining, so...

43:03.539 --> 43:05.780
it felt like the whole world was crying.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.203
But you know what I remember most?

43:12.340 --> 43:13.705
Is that when he left...

43:15.134 --> 43:17.125
he walked all the way out to his car...

43:18.262 --> 43:19.923
without ever looking back.

43:20.723 --> 43:21.838
Not once.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.552
What's wrong with you?

43:33.361 --> 43:34.692
Ah, fuck.

43:40.076 --> 43:43.239
I don't give a goddamn
what the law says, Larry!

43:44.831 --> 43:48.119
This is extortion, blackmail. Whatever.

43:49.127 --> 43:53.212
Okay, I'll tell you what,
you go to hell. Sorry.

43:55.258 --> 43:57.737
What did he say?
If I don't pay at least 500 bucks,

43:57.760 --> 43:59.967
he won't give me
my personal property back.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.576
I'm guessing it's not just
a pair of underwear.

44:03.599 --> 44:07.330
No, it was all of my photos of Mary
and my daughter in a box.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.891
And these little cards Mary would
make me for birthdays, anniversaries.

44:11.274 --> 44:12.810
Her ring was in there too.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.726
Her wedding ring?
Yes.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.415
What happened to her?

44:33.296 --> 44:34.878
I'm sorry, maybe you don't...

44:39.969 --> 44:43.074
I was doing a three-day run,
and Mary and I had been fighting

44:43.097 --> 44:45.213
because she hated it
when I had to leave.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.539
And the last night,
the last night I was gone,

44:49.562 --> 44:51.678
I would have been home by noon
the next day,

44:52.315 --> 44:54.460
her stupid cigarette
lit the couch on fire,

44:54.483 --> 44:56.850
old piece of shit,
and the fire spread into...

44:58.529 --> 45:01.647
The fire spread into...

45:02.200 --> 45:04.942
I'm sorry, I can't say her name
'cause I get very upset.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.197
I'm sorry.
She...

45:07.580 --> 45:10.322
My little girl, she's
five, she was five.

45:11.792 --> 45:15.535
Well, they say that the smoke
got to her before the fire did, so...

45:16.130 --> 45:19.293
But I should've stayed.
I should never have left.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.423
Work's not optional.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.115
That's what I kept telling myself
when I walked out the door,

45:24.138 --> 45:27.076
but this time it was different.
She was scared, she was crying.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.913
I said, "Baby, I gotta go.

45:29.936 --> 45:32.123
I gotta...
I gotta pay the loan on the truck,

45:32.146 --> 45:34.292
I gotta pay the mortgage on the house."

45:34.315 --> 45:36.647
Now the truck is gone, house is gone...

45:36.984 --> 45:40.067
I shouldn't have left,
I... I... I should've stayed.

45:41.155 --> 45:46.070
And... And they took the last
little piece of them I... I had.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.574
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

46:13.312 --> 46:16.430
"Mama. Mama."

46:46.804 --> 46:50.422
Girl, you really mangled this thing.
You're lucky to be alive.

46:53.561 --> 46:55.039
Where's my mom?

46:55.062 --> 46:58.020
She said she had to go into town early.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.231
Said she had to run some errands.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.563
So,

47:03.946 --> 47:06.233
it's just us today?
Yeah.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.949
Looks like it's me and you.

47:20.046 --> 47:21.161
It's open.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.321
Hey, Joe.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.778
What?
Come here.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.224
You okay?
Yeah.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.435
How's it going out there?

48:22.858 --> 48:24.223
That's my shirt.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.683
Used to be.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.819
So... how's it going?

48:33.160 --> 48:36.243
I got it started. Cross your fingers
I can keep it running.

48:40.793 --> 48:42.329
You can fix anything.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.733
Yeah, but somewhere,
your mother's crossing her fingers

48:45.756 --> 48:48.373
it won't stay running,
so you gotta cancel out her vote.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.713
Well, back at it,

48:52.513 --> 48:55.130
I guess.
You're fucking her, aren't you?

48:56.183 --> 48:57.924
'Who?
"Who?

48:58.644 --> 49:00.555
There's only three of us here, Majors.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.013
You're certainly not fucking me.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.314
Don't call me that.

49:06.527 --> 49:07.608
Why?

49:08.195 --> 49:09.777
It's what I always call you.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.574
How do you know my last name?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.573
Because it's my last name too.

49:19.748 --> 49:21.204
Don't do that.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.838
I missed you, Majors.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.499
I said stop it.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.376
That's all I ever did.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.677
You were gone so much.

49:36.599 --> 49:40.718
Just sit in that house... and miss you.

49:42.605 --> 49:43.811
Billie's gone.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.605
It's me...

49:48.194 --> 49:49.229
Mary.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.277
You don't know what you're saying.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.552
Mary's dead, so you...
You have some respect for my wife,

49:54.575 --> 49:56.361
or I'll spank it into you.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.326
You'd never hit me.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.701
Never did.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.329
Even when I dared you...

50:07.213 --> 50:08.920
even when I hit you first.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.836
When Billie was in the hospital...

50:18.599 --> 50:20.761
her spirit left her body...

50:22.603 --> 50:23.934
and mine came in.

50:29.318 --> 50:30.729
I'm here, baby.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.327
Why are you fucking her?

50:42.790 --> 50:43.825
Huh?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.661
I know what you really want.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.498
Why are you doing this?

50:50.089 --> 50:51.921
We could have what we had before.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.796
We could have another child.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.886
Don't you miss Sarah?

51:00.140 --> 51:01.630
Don't you miss our baby girl?

51:02.226 --> 51:05.560
I was with her right until
I came back to you,

51:06.438 --> 51:09.377
and I miss her every
second that I'm here.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.390
How...

51:12.486 --> 51:14.818
How did you... How did
you know her name?

51:15.531 --> 51:17.363
I know everything about you, Joe.

51:18.617 --> 51:21.905
About your dad. How he used to beat you.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.954
I'm your wife...

51:27.459 --> 51:29.166
and I'm Sarah's mother.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.876
You believe that woman can bring
people back from the dead...

51:37.052 --> 51:39.009
why can't you believe that it's me?

51:42.182 --> 51:45.095
Because... Because I don't deserve this.

51:50.441 --> 51:51.556
I'm here.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.450
Mary. Mary.

52:57.883 --> 52:58.793
Here.

53:00.469 --> 53:03.052
I missed you. I missed you.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.247
Someone? Something?

54:18.881 --> 54:20.121
Hey.
You got it.

54:22.342 --> 54:23.503
Told you I would.

54:24.803 --> 54:26.669
Where's Billie?
Thank you.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.162
Asleep, in her room, I think.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.472
I... I don't know. I haven't seen her.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.645
<i>I know everything
about you, Joe.</i>

54:57.711 --> 54:59.565
How did things go while I was gone?

54:59.588 --> 55:00.669
Good.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.964
Nothing... Nothing happened.

55:07.679 --> 55:10.091
I... I fixed her bike.
Good.

55:11.642 --> 55:14.600
I'm gonna get that thing sold on
Craigslist before she wakes up.

55:22.236 --> 55:23.567
Is that your wife?

55:24.404 --> 55:25.485
Yes.

55:28.617 --> 55:29.607
Pretty.

55:49.930 --> 55:52.342
Golden shower!

56:39.563 --> 56:40.849
Oh!

57:04.004 --> 57:06.792
<i>You believe that woman
can bring back the dead.</i>

57:07.466 --> 57:10.834
<i>Don't you miss Sarah?
Don't you miss our baby girl?</i>

57:11.178 --> 57:12.794
<i>We could have another child.</i>

58:07.985 --> 58:09.271
What are you doing?

58:10.362 --> 58:11.568
What does it look like?

58:14.241 --> 58:16.107
Looks like invasion of privacy.

58:22.457 --> 58:25.245
Joe is not gonna like it
that you're going through his stuff.

58:26.086 --> 58:27.793
You don't know anything about him.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.461
Well...

58:31.091 --> 58:32.707
I know him better than you think.

58:35.721 --> 58:38.179
And I might ask him to stay
a little bit longer.

58:40.892 --> 58:42.053
Why?

58:44.354 --> 58:45.594
Because I like him.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.645
You're just gonna fuck it up...

58:51.903 --> 58:53.485
like you did with your husband.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.862
My husband?

58:57.909 --> 58:59.616
Your father, young lady.

59:06.293 --> 59:08.580
Yeah, that's what I meant.

59:29.608 --> 59:33.067
You're so distracted. Why? Why?

59:44.664 --> 59:46.727
What do you wanna do? This?
I... I was just...

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:13.607
<i>When Billie was in the hospital,</i>

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.895
<i>her spirit left her body,</i>

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.980
<i>and mine came in.</i>

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.490
What are you doing?

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.448
She's gonna come between us.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:30.537
She's the reason we're back together.
You can't hurt her.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.080
You'd be surprised at what I can do.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.001
I was.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.764
I'm not gonna let it go wrong this time.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.319
Hi.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.077
You tampered in something
that was not your business.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:15.704
But my daughter was dying.
That was our business.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.998
Now, you do not know your daughter,
do you?

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.170
No. No.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.337
Every soul leaves its body eventually.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.327
That is the way of things.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.071
Oh, God, you're such a little tart,
such a little tart.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.155
We're gonna stay together?

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.953
Wha... What... What if she finds out?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.394
You're not gonna pussy out on me
this time.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.979
What are you talking about?

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.834
You're not gonna pussy out on me
this time.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.789
You wanna talk to me?

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:02.715
Let's talk dirty.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.760
Read to me from <i>Memories,</i> Joe.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.130
Again?
Yes.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.176
"They enjoyed the Arc de Triomphe.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.137
He rode your happiness...

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:20.422
and she straddled my mouth,
your tongues joining above me."

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.965
I found Billie, I brought her back.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:24.571
You brought someone back.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:29.777
These spirits linger
around people they have lost.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:34.449
Who was with you,
when you crossed over to the other side?

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.915
Joe. Joe was with me.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.709
Did he lose someone?

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.090
Yes, um...

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.086
His wife and his daughter,
they died in a fire.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:51.973
Spirits that leave this world
unexpectedly and horribly

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.436
are the ones that hold on the longest.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:03:00.182
How... How do I fix it?
You've done enough.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.352
This spirit may be confused,
it may be weak.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.358
It...

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.443
may go back where it belongs.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.066
It... It may?

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.818
No, no, this is... It's not leaving.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.434
Well... Please, come on.
There's gotta be a way.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:18.041
That way is the way you are walking now.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.537
But if you want my advice,

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:23.497
stop.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.754
When you try to change the way of things,
you never know what will happen.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:35.267
"Your peach juice cascaded over
and upon my golden cock.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:38.262
I knew then that we were a family.

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:43.255
Our tribe, our heat melting,
the snow beneath us

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.591
on top of the mountain
as the Inwood applauded..."

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.821
Oh, yeah! Oh, God! Fuck!

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.737
Don't you ever leave me alone again.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.739
What was that? What was that?

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.074
It was the cat.
Huh? Cat?

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.952
You don't... You don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat!

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:19.848
Whoo!

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:33.283
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Julie! Julie, wait, wait. Julie.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.114
Julie.
Oh, my God.

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:38.330
Julie, that is Mary, my wife.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.605
You brought my wife back.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.711
Who you just fucked, that's...
That's Billie, that's my daughter!

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.987
I'm sorry to say this.
Billie is dead, that is Mary.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.865
No, no, no, no, she's not dead.
She's lost, okay?

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.409
And that... That thing
hijacked her body,

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.594
and I need you to help me
get her back and fix this!

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:58.892
Oh, really? How?

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:03.251
I... I don't know how! Fuck!
Julie.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:04.503
...fucking kidding me.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.214
Julie. Julie.
Where is she? Where is she?

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.548
She locked herself in her room.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.858
Now, I am so sorry, but...
Shut the fuck up!

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.900
Your voice is disgusting to me!

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.327
You took advantage of me and of her!

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.287
You fix this.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.104
You better fix this!
What do you expect me to do?

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.333
Kill my wife?

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.421
Put your fucking pants on! You're gross!

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.760
Well, I don't know
what makes you say that.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.884
Okay, so, we're going to...

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:45.021
Okay, and then you'll choke me,
so I can get Billie...

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:50.268
You hit her.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.981
Julie. Julie.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.653
She'll be fine.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.451
She's a tough bitch.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.374
She was gonna kill me, Joe.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:08.704
And I'm not ready to die, not again.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.028
Not until you're ready to come with me.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.883
Did you have to hit her so hard?

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.216
We have to get out of here.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.297
Go? Go where?

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.810
Home. I wanna take you home, Joe.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:28.645
We need some money.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:35.814
I got it.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:38.775
I have an idea.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.902

Hey.

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.193
You feeling better?
Kinda.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.773
Just had to get out of there.
My mom wouldn't stop hovering.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.861
You're looking better.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.411
Yeah.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.795
All the clean living and oxycodone.

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:17.340
You staying?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.634
You guys got anything to eat?

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.120
Yeah, I think we have some leftover

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.636
waffle fries, Miracle Whip,
and some Fruit Roll-Ups.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.929
You can help yourself.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.180
Cool.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.478
Get him, Joe.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:21.897
Hey, man.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.524
I... I think he's dead.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.640
Baby, are you okay?
I didn't mean to.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.122
It was... It was an accident.
Hey! Hey, man!

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:39.751
Baby»-

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.755
it was him or you.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.033
Let's get out of here.
Maybe...

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.035
Maybe he's not dead.
Maybe we should call an ambulance.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:48.264
It's too late.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:09:59.643
Oh, God.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:03.108
Hi...

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.817
I... I just wanted to repo... Um...

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:09.490
My daughter, she...

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:12.664
Actually, she... It's okay, she's fine.

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.904
Put your fucking hands up!
Mike! God! What happened?

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.031
Put 'em up!
Put the gun down, Mike.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.741
Sit the fuck down! Sit the fuck down!

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.132
Okay, okay, sitting down, okay?
Please, put the gun down, Mike.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.058
Why did Billie and your friend rob us?

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.581
I can explain, I can try...

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.436
Why? Explain!

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:38.461
They fucking shot Rick!
What?

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.380
They killed him, they almost killed me.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.132
Oh, my God. Fuck!

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.135
That guy is your friend.
What's he done to her?

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.069
That wasn't Billie, it wasn't, okay?

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.597
I know that nothing has made any sense,

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.434
and I'm gonna explain it to you,
but nothing that I can say

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.788
is gonna make any sense.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.828
How hard did they fucking hit you?

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.761
You remember this, right, baby?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.561
Sure, I do.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.119
<i>I didn't mean
to burn this place down.</i>

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.042
<i>It all happened so quickly.</i>

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:55.888
<i>I told you that I'm
not good on my own.</i>

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.270
<i>I wanted you to find us.</i>

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.402
Let's go play. Let's go play.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:59.247
A ghost is taking over Billie's body,
like some sort of hermit crab?

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:01.813
Mike, we can't call the police, okay?

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.773
I want Billie home,
I don't want her in jail.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.662
The cops are the last thing
I wanna deal with.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.589
They shot Rick with my gun.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:11.801
Right. I'm sorry about Rick. I'm sorry.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:18.642
How do we find them?
You have to choke me.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.518
Wouldn't just...
Just shooting you be easier?

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:39.370
You're not happy, are you, Joe?

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.158
Just... taking it all in.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.168
Why'd it have to be cloudy?

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.838
I wanted to see the stars.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.511
No stars where you were?

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:01.893
I don't remember any.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.806
It's all starting to fade away now.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.518
All I remember is missing you.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.732
You want the stars, baby?

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.867
I'll give you the stars.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:22.075
You're gonna give me the stars, Joe?

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.542
I always said I would.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.389
You don't fool me, Joe.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.400
What does that mean?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.738
You never wanted any of this.
I wanted you.

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.862
I wanted our little girl.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:01.152
I was just...

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.866
on the road so much,
I didn't think I deserved you.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.080
Did you deserve Julie?

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:19.262
I don't deserve anybody.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.187
You remember the plan?
"Plan."

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.016
That's a cute name for this insanity.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:51.287
It's gonna be different, right, Joe?
It's gonna be different.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:55.875
We can rebuild.
We can make up for lost time.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.546
You mean that?
I do. I... I really do.

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:03.222
I mean, I don't...

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:07.018
understand how it happened, but...

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.794
the universe has given me...

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:12.898
And me.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.856
...a second chance.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:17.945
It's a...

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:20.762
I wanna believe you, Joe.

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:23.026
I'm not going on the road anymore.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:27.864
I'm staying here. You're stuck with me.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.534
You're not gaslighting me, are you?

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:55.479
What is it?
Wha... What?

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.966
Uh, I heard something.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.052
Your conscience,
and it thinks you're a piece of shit.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.595
Fuck!
Stay where you are.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.780
Man, that guy came after me.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.202
Mike...

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.288
it's me.
No, save it.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.855
You're not Billie, and it makes me sick
that something like you

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:14.710
is crawling around inside her.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.820
Mary, I just want my
daughter back, okay? L__

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:19.878
How bad?

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:22.836
Drop the fucking gun
or I'll blow his head off.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:26.389
Nobody's shooting that
sad bastard but me.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:31.185
Is she another one
of your fixer-uppers, Joe?

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:36.475
I told you that I'm
not good on my own...

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.268
not with our child...

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:41.858
not with myself.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.192
It was dangerous to do that.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.706
Sarah was dead before the fire.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.668
It was harder than I thought.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.567
You...

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:00.444
She was little,
but she didn't wanna die.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:03.755
You... You'd never hurt her.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.841
Not her, baby.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:07.589
You.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.788
I wanted you to find us.

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.927
I didn't mean to burn this place down.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.772
It all happened so quickly.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.015
You killed your own daughter?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.268
How about I just shoot you, Mama?

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:23.446
Then I don't have to worry about
Billie repossessing her body.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.199
Drop it, now!
You wouldn't shoot Billie.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.807
You're so in love with Billie,
it's fucking embarrassing.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.935
Drop the fucking gun!
Mike, Mike. Drop the gun, please.

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.624
<i>Let's go play.
Let's go play.</i>

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:40.963
Sarah.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.508
Sarah!
<i>Let's go play.</i>

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.620
Sarah!

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.330
<i>Let's go play.
Let's go play.</i>

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.889
Sarah.
Joe. Joe.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.792
Baby, don't. Baby...
Sarah.

01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:58.305
Sarah...
Joe.

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:02.356
Mary, I just want my daughter back.
Come on...

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:07.899
What have you done?

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.906
You are where you belong.

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:14.364
No, it's too late. You're dying.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:17.329
You can't keep me here!

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.118
Mommy.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:23.463
You came back for me, Mommy.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.549
Stop.

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:28.507
Sarah...

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.138
Sarah?

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:34.558
Sarah?

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.939
Sarah?

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:56.827
Sarah?

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:09.927
Hey.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.175
Who are you?

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:16.058
I am... I'm Billie.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.186
What's going on?
Where did we meet?

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.768
Where?
What's going on?

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:28.438
Shop class.
What do you have, amnesia, dumb-ass?

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:38.331
Mama. Mama. Mama!

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:41.250
What happened to her? Mommy.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:45.026
Billie. Billie. Billie.
Mama. Mama.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:47.153
We have to help her.
I know. But we can't!

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.793
All right, Billie...

No, you fucking stop it!

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:07.392
Fuck! Stop sucking the life out of me.

You guys are like two fucking fleas.
Draining me.

01:23:11.445 --> 01:23:14.175
Well, I'm sorry you're so disappointed
in the both of us.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:16.565
You're fucking dis...
Really?

01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:18.762
Stop.
Jesus.

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:21.447
Should burn this fucking place
to the ground, is what I ought to do.

Joe. Joe, no, honey.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:28.647

Joe. No, he's drunk, Joe.
