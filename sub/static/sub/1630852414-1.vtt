WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:13.930
Where's Regina?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.891
Ana, you kicked us out.
You can't tell us what to do.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.269
-You can't just take her!
-Ana!

00:19.352 --> 00:20.729
What are you doing?

00:24.274 --> 00:25.358
Relax, ma'am.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.485
Where's Regina?

00:29.487 --> 00:30.780
Pass the joint, Penguin.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.868
Why does she have a tattoo?

00:34.951 --> 00:37.120
We don't want her
to be bullied at daycare.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.329
You're crazy.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.041
-I'm taking her.
-Ana, leave! That's enough!

00:41.124 --> 00:43.585
Let me go!
Regina won't grow up a degenerate.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.253
You're dead to us.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.173
Leave us alone for good!

00:53.595 --> 00:56.222
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:56.741 --> 01:57.700
Stop, Mom.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.496
Stop looking at me
like a run-over deer on the road.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.415
I'm looking at you normally. Aren't I?

02:04.499 --> 02:08.461
No, you're frowning,
just like when my dad was hungover.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.423
You're nuts. But if it bothers you,
I'll sit somewhere else.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.510
I only stayed
because you didn't seem well.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.262
Can we not talk about this?

02:17.345 --> 02:19.013
Mom, I want to talk about it.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.723
Why isn't Dad here?

02:20.807 --> 02:23.059
That's between your dad and me.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.894
Why are Mariana and Regina gone?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.771
That's between Mariana and me.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.983
Besides, they were going
to leave someday, right?

02:30.066 --> 02:32.735
-Don't you care about Regina?
-Where did they go?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.404
I don't know. And I don't care.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.697
-But, Mom--
-I don't care!

02:36.739 --> 02:38.575
All you need to know

02:38.658 --> 02:40.785
is that Mariana and Regina
no longer live here.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.162
Neither does your dad.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.249
MARIANA
PLEASE, ANA. I NEED TO EXPLAIN.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.292
Is that my dad?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.252
-Is it Mariana?
-Is it Juan Carlos?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.880
Is it your old bosses
begging you to come back?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.464
-Who was it?
-Mom!

02:53.548 --> 02:54.716
Who was it?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.093
Unknown number.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.098
Hey, you look pretty!

03:02.182 --> 03:03.057
Yeah.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.184
Good morning.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.269
You're still here.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.605
Hi.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.857
Want some pancakes?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.526
-Yes.
-Cynthia made them.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.738
-They're from a box mix.
-They're amazing.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.114
And you are?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.365
Karla.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.159
Karla.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.121
-Can I give her a little?
-No.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.707
We don't give her refined flours.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.751
Come on, Mariana. She'll be fine.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.127
She's allergic, Pablo.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.631
You don't even seem like her dad.

03:37.091 --> 03:40.136
I used to have allergies as a kid,
but they went away.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.095
Lucky you.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.306
You could spend the night here

03:43.389 --> 03:45.975
and make these delicious pancakes
from a box mix.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.519
Chill, Mariana, here.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.564
Drink some coffee and relax, will you?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.399
I can't have coffee in the morning.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.235
You know that.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.445
Damn, don't you remember? We used to date.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.950
We also used to date, yeah.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.534
This is weird.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.288
What happened at the baptism
shouldn't have happened.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.290
Don't beat yourself up.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.126
What happened had to happen.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.172
Mariana will have to forgive you
because you're her mother.

04:16.256 --> 04:20.176
You should learn to trust the universe.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.470
-Give me a break, Mom.
-What?

04:22.553 --> 04:25.765
Mariana won't forgive me
because the universe wills it.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.558
No.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.310
I need to talk to her.

04:29.394 --> 04:33.690
All I'm saying is you need to have faith.

04:33.773 --> 04:38.278
That's what I did when I asked for
an apartment so I could move to the city.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.489
Now look at this! Isn't it beautiful?

04:41.572 --> 04:42.824
You asked the universe

04:42.907 --> 04:45.493
and three real estate agents you pestered

04:45.576 --> 04:47.745
until they found you a place. Come on.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.539
Well, whatever.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.625
Eat your breakfast before it gets cold.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.588
Don't you have any food?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.674
Not even a box mix for some chilaquiles?

04:59.757 --> 05:02.677
Sorry, I'm out. And you know what?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.804
They'd be great for this hangover.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.142
The baptism was pretty funny, huh?

05:09.225 --> 05:12.228
I don't want to talk about it.
I haven't even had breakfast.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.815
We could order chilaquiles
from El Cardenal or wherever you like.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.775
I like the ones Altagracia makes.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.570
And I like them even better
with my wife and kids.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.281
That's going to take a while.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.782
I'm talking from experience.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.994
A woman recovers from childbirth
sooner than from infidelity.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.122
You should learn
to enjoy the bachelor life.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.459
Get yourself an apartment,
walk around naked.

05:34.542 --> 05:38.254
Wait, no. I don't need an apartment.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.548
I'm going to get my house and family back.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.717
What?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.677
I'm going to get breakfast.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.513
Damn, you're a pain in the ass, Juanqui.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.935
You have to tell them something.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.564
You never talked to me
about what happened with Dad.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.358
I had to find out on my own.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.152
I thought I was protecting you,
but that was a mistake.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.155
I'll decide when it's time
to talk to my children.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.865
I just want what's best for you.

06:05.948 --> 06:09.786
What's best for me right now
is for you to leave me alone.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.579
All right.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.751
But no one actually believes
you don't care about Regina.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.677
Where's your friend?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.263
Did you send her home?

06:29.347 --> 06:30.848
It was a one-night stand.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.644
Besides, this place
is getting pretty cramped as it is.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.688
I have to get a job so I can pitch in.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.816
No one's asking you to, Mariana.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.152
I know, but I don't want
to depend on anyone,

06:43.236 --> 06:44.654
least of all Pablo.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.116
What's up with him dating Ana's assistant?

06:48.199 --> 06:50.076
She's also Chava's cousin.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.162
They were both at the baptism, and…

06:53.246 --> 06:55.832
Don't remind me about that awful baptism.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.958
It was nice.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.334
-Nice?
-Yeah.

06:58.418 --> 07:03.756
I don't know why you decided to declare
your love for Ana in front of everyone.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.551
-My romantic compass is broken.
-Oh, come on.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.221
Don't beat yourself up.
You were just confused.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.434
And you have two beautiful babies.
How are you?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.352
That's right, isn't it?

07:16.436 --> 07:20.314
We miss Valentina. We want to see her,
but Ana won't answer my texts.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.400
Hello, Regina.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.904
How are you? I'm your friend, the unicorn.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.283
May I come in?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.870
That unicorn was Valentina's.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.914
No wonder it was all slobbery,
but I washed it.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.459
I wanted to give it to Regina.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.303
Thanks, I guess.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.054
Okay, I should get back to Pablo.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.184
"I should get back to Pablo."

07:57.643 --> 07:58.686
What?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.731
Elena!

08:02.607 --> 08:04.692
I need to see my owner.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.363
My darling. My beautiful baby girl.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.716
<i>-Pablo?</i>
-Ana?

08:28.799 --> 08:32.637
Hey, I'm calling because
some of Regina's things are here.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.347
I can send them over with Ramón.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.433
Well, I think you should ask Mariana.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.769
<i>Well, Mariana and I</i>
<i>aren't speaking right now.</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:43.272
I'm only doing this
for Regina's sake, nothing more.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.484
Sure, no problem.
I'm sure it'll be okay with Mariana.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.986
Great. Can I get your address?

08:49.070 --> 08:52.156
It's 41 Ciencias Street,
Escandón neighborhood.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.659
-Very well. I'll send Ramón over tomorrow.
-Okay.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.077
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.543
Hello?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.797
Romelia, hi. Is Ana there?
She's not answering her phone.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.674
-And for good reason.
<i>-What?</i>

09:10.174 --> 09:14.887
I mean, maybe she doesn't have it.
Let me see if she's around.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.055
It's Juan Carlos.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.307
No. Tell him I'm not home.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.018
No, she isn't here.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.396
<i>She just left for the office.</i>

09:24.188 --> 09:26.399
Romelia, Ana doesn't work
at the office anymore.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.734
Ana went out to do some errands.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.404
<i>Oh, Mom.</i>

09:31.487 --> 09:33.614
-You're a terrible liar.
-Yeah.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.158
I don't like to get involved.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.869
Besides, I've never
been good at improvising.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.207
Answer. Tell him--

09:46.294 --> 09:48.129
-What do you want, Juan Carlos?
<i>-Ana!</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:49.922
We need to talk.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.341
-There's nothing to talk about.
<i>-Yes, there is.</i>

09:52.425 --> 09:53.467
I want to come home.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.802
Oh!

09:55.386 --> 09:58.097
You should've thought of that
before cheating on me, no?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.474
<i>-Juan Carlos, stop calling.</i>
-Ana!

10:00.558 --> 10:01.892
<i>I want to see my kids.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:05.021
<i>Let's figure out what we're telling them.</i>

10:05.104 --> 10:05.980
Fine.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.859
I'll meet you at Café Sultán
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.364
<i>You should knock first, Rodrigo.</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:18.075
We can find out
what happened at the baptism.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.578
If you think you can bribe Alta,
you're mistaken.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.747
Mom and Dad are meeting tomorrow
at Café Sultán.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.833
Are we invited?

10:25.916 --> 10:28.753
No, but if we go there,
we could spy on them.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.339
I can hear conversations
60 feet away with this.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.299
Jeez, Rodrigo.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.551
No wonder you know everything, gossip.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.680
Well, that's not the point.
The point is, this is our chance.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.517
You're right.
We have to think of something.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.606
This isn't neutral ground, Mom.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.399
Grandma always takes your side.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.403
Hey, I didn't come back to the city
for you to be fighting, okay?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.824
-No one asked you to move to the city.
-Don't talk to your grandma like that.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.745
Besides, I don't know why
you're living as a freeloader

11:02.828 --> 11:05.665
with Pablo and Elena
when you could be living with me.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.668
I'd rather live with them
than with the enemy.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.128
Hey! That's no way to talk to your mom.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.882
You'll understand when Regina judges you
for your mistakes.

11:14.965 --> 11:15.800
That's true.

11:15.883 --> 11:20.179
And I don't get why we're still fighting
if everything's out in the open.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.889
-You have no shame!
-Hey!

11:21.972 --> 11:25.434
It's your fault Ana won't talk to me,
and I can't see Valentina, Mom.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.445
-So?
-What?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.241
I thought the incense
would do the trick this time?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.828
I must've used the wrong aroma.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.996
-Oh, Mom!
-Oh!

11:46.831 --> 11:48.791
I don't know what's up
with Mariana. Maybe--

11:48.874 --> 11:51.627
No, you don't owe me any explanation.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.254
It's fine.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.176
Can you see who he's with?

11:59.260 --> 12:01.804
No, ma'am.
Let me get ahead of them to see.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.143
Careful, they'll see me! Keep going.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.523
Is everything okay?

12:13.858 --> 12:14.817
Yes.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.987
You won't believe it, ma'am.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.905
It was Cynthia, your ex-assistant.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.492
Really?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.244
<i>She'll be happy to see it.</i>

12:25.327 --> 12:27.288
It was her favorite.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.916
I'm sorry, Mariana. I can't let you in
without Ana's permission.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.669
I'm her mother too.
You can't keep me from seeing her.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.923
If I let you in, she'll kick me out,
just like you and Mr. Juan Carlos.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.593
Mrs. Ana isn't exactly the forgiving type.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.178
Let her in, Altagracia.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.346
This is my house too. Come.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.766
Thanks, Ceci. Thank you.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.976
<i>This is hell.</i>

12:49.477 --> 12:53.272
Imagine Mom without a job, without Dad,
and without you, her best friend.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.525
Not being able
to see Valentina is killing me.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.319
What are you doing?

12:58.402 --> 13:01.864
I'm syncing the monitor to my phone
so that Regis can see her sister.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.866
Oh, come here.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.786
Come here, please.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.246
We miss Regis so much.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.332
And we miss you. Come here.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.876
Hey,

13:14.376 --> 13:16.504
you'll always be our family.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.256
No matter what happens between Ana and me.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.467
What's going on?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.094
Is it yummy?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.221
Hey, Mariana.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.848
What happened at the baptism?

13:27.932 --> 13:30.434
-Why did my dad leave?
-And why did you two leave?

13:30.518 --> 13:33.896
Ana and I had a fight
because I wasn't honest.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.899
It's a tiff between friends.
I'm sure we'll work it out.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.068
As for your dad,

13:39.151 --> 13:41.278
it's not my place to say.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.198
Of course it's not your place.
Come here, sweetie.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.788
Besides, who said
you could come into my house uninvited?

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
I invited her in.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.749
Mariana is still our friend.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.460
Your friend's a traitor.
That's why I kicked her out.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.379
-She's not.
-Why did you kick her out?

13:58.462 --> 14:01.757
I kicked her out because she kissed me.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.636
-She kissed me first.
-After you drugged me.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.764
You decided to eat a choco-shroom.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.976
You said you were in love with me.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.394
I'm confused.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.272
-I'm not a lesbian.
-All right, stop!

14:16.355 --> 14:19.608
Mom, there's nothing wrong
with someone telling you they love you.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.486
You just need to say
you don't feel the same way.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.114
What are you two doing?
This is between Mariana and me.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.074
It's not a talk show. Go to your room.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.784
-That's not fair.
-What happened?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.077
Go to your room!

14:33.330 --> 14:35.124
You too. Time to leave.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.754
-Don't be so nosy.
-Ana.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.550
We need to talk, for the girls' sake.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.845
You should've thought of that
before betraying me, no?

14:48.512 --> 14:51.473
Please try to understand.
I was in a difficult position.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.769
Listen, I don't condone her actions,
but she's my mom.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.146
Would you betray yours?

14:57.229 --> 15:00.482
You deceived me in my own home.
I can't forgive that.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.737
Ana, I'm worried about you,
about the cancer.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.364
It's not cancer. I'm fine.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.744
You and I have nothing more to discuss.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.790
So you don't care about Regina anymore?

15:16.874 --> 15:18.792
Of course I care about Regina.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.419
But what can I do?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.379
You ruined everything.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.797
Goodbye.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.008
Ana.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.390
Goodbye.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.697
You can see your sister on here,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.158
but just for a little while.

15:51.241 --> 15:57.039
Babies under two
shouldn't stare at screens, you know?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.332
Let's see Vale.

15:58.916 --> 15:59.875
Look at her.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.127
Say, "Hello, Vale."

16:02.836 --> 16:04.129
Isn't she cute?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.214
<i>Cynthia.</i>

16:05.297 --> 16:08.968
I know you're not my assistant anymore,
but I thought we were friends.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.263
My little one! My precious girl is awake!

16:13.347 --> 16:15.516
<i>We started going out after the baptism.</i>

16:15.599 --> 16:18.185
We didn't go out. We stayed at his place.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.521
I mean, we only slept.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.232
Yeah, well, I don't need the details.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.318
Look, I have a favor to ask.

16:26.902 --> 16:30.572
I need you to take pictures
of Pablo's apartment

16:30.656 --> 16:32.574
so I can see Regina's living situation.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.036
<i>Ana, I can't do that.</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:38.080
<i>That's an invasion of privacy.</i>

16:38.163 --> 16:41.500
Oh please! Whose privacy?

16:41.583 --> 16:42.960
Everyone lives there now.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.294
<i>Even you.</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:46.672
I miss her so much, Cynthia.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.008
I don't know how she's doing,

16:49.091 --> 16:51.343
<i>and I don't want to call Mariana.</i>

16:51.427 --> 16:53.012
<i>Regis is doing just fine.</i>

16:53.095 --> 16:54.596
<i>No, you don't get it.</i>

16:54.680 --> 16:57.683
I haven't slept in days.
I don't know how she's doing.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.353
Last night I even had a dream
where she was smoking weed.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.064
<i>Don't laugh.</i>

17:04.148 --> 17:05.607
I'm telling you as a friend.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.818
Okay, fine, Ana.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.700
Hello, Penguin, hi!

17:14.783 --> 17:16.910
Daddy's here! Yes, he is!

17:16.994 --> 17:19.705
Where's that nosy Cynthia?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.749
Come on. Leave her alone.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.876
She's only trying to be nice.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.004
Since when does that entail
coming to our house,

17:27.087 --> 17:30.215
sleeping in your bed,
and eating our box mix pancakes?

17:30.299 --> 17:33.594
You didn't live here.
I'm not saying you're not welcome,

17:34.094 --> 17:37.181
but you don't get a say
in who I choose to date.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.767
Cynthia is a good person.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.227
Pablo, she's a spy.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.230
It's obvious Ana planned this
after the baptism.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.566
I don't know how I didn't see it earlier.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.611
What are you talking about?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.614
Ana planted Cynthia to keep tabs on me.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.907
Can't you see?

17:56.241 --> 17:59.036
-You're just as crazy as Ana.
-You don't believe me?

18:00.037 --> 18:02.915
I'll prove it to you.
Don't worry. You don't have to do a thing.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.125
I'll take care of it. Isn't that right?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.668
"Yes, Mommy."

18:07.169 --> 18:10.005
Let's leave your dad
to reflect on his friendships.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.385
Where is he? I don't want to be late.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.600
-What are you doing here?
-We're waiting for an Uber.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.310
Why doesn't Ramón drive you?

18:23.393 --> 18:24.937
He left earlier with Mom.

18:25.813 --> 18:26.730
Where are you going?

18:26.814 --> 18:29.399
-To--
-To see a cute boy that I like.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.818
You have a boyfriend?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.320
-Sort of.
-So where is he?

18:33.403 --> 18:34.863
He's at Café Sultán.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.991
Oh, I love their cupcakes.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.619
Get in. I'll drive you and buy some.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.255
<i>Things aren't what they seem.</i>

18:51.338 --> 18:53.507
I want to explain what happened with Tere.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.009
We met long before I knew
she was Mariana's mom.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.262
I don't need you to explain.
I'm not ready.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.263
I don't care.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.349
We need to work this out
for the sake of our kids.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.184
Maybe some other day.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.187
Today, we're only deciding
what we're going to tell them

19:07.271 --> 19:09.481
and making arrangements
for you to see them.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.276
-We can't tell them the truth.
-Of course not.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.737
I don't think they need
to know the details, right?

19:19.283 --> 19:22.828
We'll tell them we're separating
due to irreconcilable differences.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.789
Are they really irreconcilable?

19:26.665 --> 19:30.419
Between you and I,
there's nothing but mistrust.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.754
<i>I beat Chava again.</i>

19:33.338 --> 19:35.048
You beat all the Cro-Magnons, huh?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.926
Very nice.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.224
Can you watch Regis for a bit?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.977
-I'm gonna throw out the diaper.
-Sure, no problem.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.606
Sit up, Penguin.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.316
Come here.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.282
She's taking pictures
with her phone! I told you!

20:03.410 --> 20:06.205
-Maybe it's for her Instagram.
-Oh, come on!

20:09.499 --> 20:10.751
What are you doing?

20:11.710 --> 20:15.339
Mariana heard Ana asking you
to take pictures of how we live.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.592
-I didn't believe her.
-I'm sorry. I couldn't say no.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.719
She had a dream that Regina smoked weed.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.514
She was manipulating you
as if you didn't know her.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.851
-She sounded sincere to me.
-What do you want to do now?

20:28.560 --> 20:32.064
We're gonna give Ana
a taste of her own medicine.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.608
We'll see if she still
doesn't want to talk to me.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.860
Cynthia?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.195
You're going to help us.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.696
Okay.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.864
<i>Don't look so scared.</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:44.618
There's nothing wrong
with making the first move with a boy.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.744
Which one is he?

20:46.370 --> 20:49.039
It's that one. Him.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.457
-Go get him.
-What?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.668
No! Grandma, what if
he's waiting for someone?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.045
Strike while the iron is hot.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.839
-Go on!
-No, Grandma. I'll do it. Okay.

20:58.799 --> 20:59.967
Good luck.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.803
Hi, how are you?

21:02.886 --> 21:03.762
Hi.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.807
Play along, and I'll buy you a croissant.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.267
Okay, fine.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.978
What I did was wrong,
but we're not telling the kids.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.437
-Of course not.
-What, then?

21:12.521 --> 21:14.731
-I don't know, let's--
-Neither do I.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.650
I'm going to the restroom,
then we'll talk.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.819
What are we doing?

21:18.902 --> 21:20.237
-Well--
-Cecilia?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.572
-What are you doing here? Who is this?
-Dad!

21:22.656 --> 21:24.574
-He's--
-Darío, pleased to meet you.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.910
Why are you with a stranger?
Who brought you?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.121
Juan Carlos, what are you doing here?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.330
Did you drive her?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.416
-What's going on?
-Why are you here?

21:32.499 --> 21:35.419
Your mom brought Ceci
to meet with this stranger.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.129
-She said she knew him.
-I'm sorry.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.840
Our plan was to spy on you.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.592
Grandma found out
and offered to drive us here.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.346
We told her Ceci was meeting
her boyfriend, this guy.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.515
-No.
-So he is your boyfriend?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.892
-I don't know him!
-So why bring them here?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.936
Forgive me.
You have nothing to do with it.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.772
Enough! Be quiet! Let's go.

21:55.856 --> 21:56.982
-Come on.
-Mom.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.191
Let's go!

21:58.275 --> 21:59.568
Mom.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.946
-Hey, I didn't get your number.
-Let's go!

22:05.324 --> 22:06.700
Go home, Cecilia.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.619
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what's going on.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.664
-Me neither.
-This is between your dad and me.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.082
This doesn't concern you.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.626
I don't care.
I just want to know what's going on.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.673
Your father and I
have irreconcilable differences.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.717
Mom, that doesn't tell us anything.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.594
Okay, Ceci, you're right.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.642
We're separating 'cause she found out
something that happened a while ago.

22:33.226 --> 22:38.482
I want you to know that doesn't change
how much we love the both of you.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.484
-Who did you cheat with?
-Ceci!

22:40.567 --> 22:41.860
-Cecilia--
-Who was it?

22:43.278 --> 22:45.238
That doesn't matter. Go home.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.281
It was Tere.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.703
You said so at the baptism
when you were drunk.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.580
That's why you kicked out Mariana.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.583
I can't believe you did that to Mom.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.251
Let's go, Ceci. You're right.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.670
Your father should've done better.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.007
Romelia, sorry, but you should stay
out of this conversation.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.635
Don't talk to her like that.
She's trying to help.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.178
Apologize.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.471
That's not necessary.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.432
All I want to say is
you shouldn't have ambushed them.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.392
Let's go.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.648
That went badly.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.070
<i>She'll get over it.</i>

23:26.405 --> 23:30.492
I'm thinking about asking Mariana
to come live with me.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.286
Maybe the three of us could live together.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.998
My apartment is big enough for all of us.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.667
Thanks, Mom,

23:39.626 --> 23:42.546
but I don't think Mariana will want to.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.466
Not until she patches things up with Ana.

23:46.550 --> 23:50.804
But how can that happen
if no one makes the first move, right?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.848
What are you thinking, Teresa?

23:55.684 --> 23:58.687
I feel terrible. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.856
Your apologies won't fix anything.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.067
I hate not being able to talk about us
and our marriage.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.194
You know why
we can't talk about our marriage?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.905
Because I don't even know
if there'll be a marriage,

24:08.989 --> 24:10.157
at least not for a while.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.741
Don't say that.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.327
What can I do? I'm scared.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.121
I'm scared too.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.081
Really scared.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.919
You're not the only one
who's had a rough time.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.090
Things have been really hard for me.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.676
I've had terrible days.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.804
I didn't tell you, but they found a lump.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.556
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.393
The doctor did a biopsy,
and luckily, it was nothing.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.147
I was so scared…

24:43.940 --> 24:46.151
and I imagined the worst.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.322
I don't know what I want.
I don't know who I am.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.450
I need you to give me some space.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.063
Sweetheart.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.732
We need to talk.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.070
Come, Ro. I see you there.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.488
Come.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.406
Sit down, sweetie.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.372
I'm sorry you had to find out like that.

25:41.957 --> 25:46.127
But you have to respect
mine and your dad's business.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.462
Don't defend him, Mom.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.755
He cheated on you.

25:50.173 --> 25:53.134
That's a problem between him and me.
No one else.

25:53.635 --> 25:57.556
I mean, do you have any doubt
your dad loves you with all his heart?

25:59.641 --> 26:01.476
Well, that's all that matters.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.573
Elena, get in there too.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.242
-Pablo, you're drunk, wasted.
-Okay, here goes.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.661
One, two, three.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.413
-Take one with us.
-Yeah.

26:21.496 --> 26:24.583
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.460
Stop it!

26:28.044 --> 26:30.005
-Ready. Want to see?
-All right.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.715
Let's see.

26:38.805 --> 26:39.681
Pablo?

26:41.516 --> 26:44.436
Sorry. I didn't want
to cause trouble with Mariana.

26:44.519 --> 26:48.064
I never meant to betray you.
I know what I did was wrong.

26:49.399 --> 26:53.486
It's called invasion of privacy,
and it's a crime everywhere.

26:58.867 --> 26:59.701
You want one?

27:11.212 --> 27:13.840
I swear I've never seen Ana so desperate.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.634
I understand why you did it.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.803
So you forgive me?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.180
Of course.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.474
I really like you and, I don't know,

27:22.557 --> 27:25.185
I want us to keep
getting to know each other.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.729
I really like you too.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.732
But I think it's too complicated,

27:30.815 --> 27:32.025
not just because of Ana.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.654
You mean Mariana?
No, she won't be a problem.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.114
We're better off as friends,

27:38.865 --> 27:40.408
and we can still do that.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.578
To friendship.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.544
Sorry, but we've chosen the pictures.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.763
Ma'am, I didn't want to let her in,

28:01.846 --> 28:04.891
but she said she wouldn't leave
until she talked to you.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.727
It's fine, Alta. You can leave us, thanks.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.566
How dare you?

28:14.859 --> 28:17.904
I came to tell you it's wrong
to blame Mariana for everything.

28:17.987 --> 28:21.116
I can't believe you'd come to my house
after everything that happened.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.702
I know, but I'd do anything
for my daughter.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.581
I know what I did was wrong,
but that's another story.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.334
When Mariana found out,
she never forgave me.

28:31.418 --> 28:35.380
You and the girls are the most important
thing in the world for her.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.134
She wanted to tell you,
but I begged her not to.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.678
Since you kicked her out,

28:41.761 --> 28:44.305
I don't know where they are living
or how they're doing.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.808
Stop talking because I don't care.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.186
I don't want to know anything
about any of you.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.022
Leave, that's what I want.
I want you to leave.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.025
Get out of my house!

29:05.618 --> 29:06.453
<i>No.</i>

29:07.036 --> 29:09.456
Ana will have a heart attack.
We shouldn't send them.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.666
We're sending them. That's the point.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.712
We want to force her to work things out
for the good of the girls.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.173
Go on!

29:18.840 --> 29:19.758
Do it.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.594
-Just hit send, dude.
-Come on, Cynthia!

29:22.677 --> 29:23.803
All right!

29:28.308 --> 29:30.769
There you go! It wasn't that hard, was it?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.520
Well done, cousin! It's done.

29:43.698 --> 29:44.532
No.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.538
Where's Cynthia?

29:51.831 --> 29:53.208
Is she still asleep?

29:53.291 --> 29:54.417
No, she went home.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.379
It wasn't fair to put her
in that position.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.007
Then why did she get involved?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.011
Pablo, I know she's your girlfriend.
I get it.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.179
No, she's not.

30:07.013 --> 30:07.972
We broke up.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.476
Actually, we hit pause on whatever it was.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.771
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
That's not what I wanted.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.606
Maybe it's for the best.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.443
It's Ana.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.363
-She wants to see me.
-Really?

30:23.446 --> 30:25.907
-This is good for the girls, right?
-Yes.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.116
Thanks, Pablo.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.167
Are you sure you'll be okay?

30:36.709 --> 30:38.127
Yeah, don't worry.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.175
Get going. I'll stay with the penguin.

30:49.931 --> 30:50.765
<i>Nice, huh?</i>

30:51.474 --> 30:56.604
The gym and amenities are fantastic,
and there's a stunning terrace over there.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.149
I didn't realize.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.112
Juanqui, this is going to be tough,

31:04.195 --> 31:06.948
but at least your kids can come here.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.910
-If they ever talk to me again.
-They will, man.

31:12.078 --> 31:12.954
Besides,

31:14.163 --> 31:15.290
I'm here for you.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.333
No matter what.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.961
Cheer up, man.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.006
<i>Have a seat.</i>

31:23.673 --> 31:26.718
-Would you like something to drink?
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

31:27.510 --> 31:32.348
Ana, I didn't mean to tell you how I felt
about you the day of the baptism.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.641
That doesn't matter.

31:35.351 --> 31:41.024
I asked you here because I found out
Regina's living conditions are lacking.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.651
How did you find out?

31:44.193 --> 31:45.820
Was it the spy you sent?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.031
Just like you sent your mom.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.492
My mother came here?

31:52.619 --> 31:54.287
Yes. You didn't know?

31:54.996 --> 31:57.457
She had the gall to come to my house

31:57.540 --> 31:59.918
to defend you
and take the blame for everything.

32:01.628 --> 32:05.882
I didn't want you to find out,
especially not like that.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.467
Fine. That doesn't matter now.

32:09.260 --> 32:13.473
Look, all I care about
is my daughters' well-being.

32:14.098 --> 32:14.933
Yeah.

32:15.725 --> 32:20.021
So I want to ask how much you want
to give me full custody of Regina.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.360
Are you trying to buy my daughter?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.820
I'm not buying her. I'm adopting her.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.575
How dare you?

32:33.201 --> 32:36.371
I'll take care of everything,
and you can see her anytime.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.749
It's clear you can't handle
the responsibility alone.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.168
What are you saying?

32:42.251 --> 32:44.212
You think I'm a bad mother?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.381
You're a mess, Mariana.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.549
Just like your mother.

32:50.551 --> 32:54.514
Look, Ana, you may do anything
for your daughters,

32:55.014 --> 32:58.434
but you should know
that I'll do everything for mine.

32:58.518 --> 33:02.146
If you think you can buy Regina,
you're terribly mistaken.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.400
And don't worry,
you'll never see us again.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.070
Screw you.

34:40.036 --> 34:44.832
