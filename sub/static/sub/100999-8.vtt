00:01.600 --> 00:03.498
Joe, I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

00:03.498 --> 00:04.975
You're not going
to take me to Vasili?

00:05.040 --> 00:06.209
I'm taking you to
the end of track 11.

00:06.209 --> 00:07.296
You can take yourself.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.920
80, Bowery Street,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.840
Thank you for seeing me,
Senator Thrush.

00:10.960 --> 00:15.200
I saw my husband who I thought I knew
ordering the death of one of our friends.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.600
Reuel has been operating
out of bounds for far too long.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.697
I don't want to pressure you into
saying something you're not ready to say.

00:20.697 --> 00:21.697
I'm ready.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.520
You were swatted
- Like a fly?

00:24.545 --> 00:28.716
This feels personal.
- You would even say childish.

00:29.005 --> 00:29.912
Get in.

00:29.912 --> 00:32.375
I think Joe Turner's is on
his way to meet Vasili Sirin.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.760
I'm already after him.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.920
Did you follow him?
Where has he been?

00:37.040 --> 00:40.011
He had a meeting
at Union Station.

00:40.011 --> 00:41.011
Who with?

00:41.647 --> 00:42.798
I couldn't see.

00:42.940 --> 00:46.040
I can't do this anymore.
I feel like they know.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.800
You are safe. Not even my
own people know who you are.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.280
It's not your people
that I'm worried about.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.760
He's stopped.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.440
If you say anything,
I'll cut your throat.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.040
Hey, man.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.640
She found you.

01:03.586 --> 01:05.093
I need you to tell
me who the mole is.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.031
I think an innocent man is
going to take the fall for him.

01:07.031 --> 01:09.796
If you tell me who it is
then I can clear his name.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.800
I would like to tell you,
but I don't know.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.800
Volk is hunting you because
he told you the name of his asset.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.529
No, he knows he said too much

01:17.529 --> 01:21.576
but he was so drunk he doesn't
remember exactly what it is he said to me.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.520
I am only fucking here
because you used me.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.280
I'm sorry, Joe.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.000
We should go. The hunters
will be here soon.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.120
Come on.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.680
Teams of two, 50 meters apart.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.880
Come with me.
- Where to?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.560
We'll leave the
hunt to the hunters.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.279
Spread out!

04:54.320 --> 04:55.760
Shit.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.560
Jesus Christ. You used me as bait?

05:58.680 --> 06:01.016
Not as bait, as a lure.

06:01.016 --> 06:02.883
There's really a difference?

06:03.520 --> 06:06.560
A lure, you hope to get back.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.960
How many people have
to die so that you can live?

06:09.080 --> 06:11.000
Do you want to surrender?

06:15.219 --> 06:17.172
They'll be here any minute

06:17.172 --> 06:19.367
We'll go to the water.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.160
How many people died in
Iraq the first two times around?

06:29.280 --> 06:32.000
Can anybody explain
to me what they died for?

06:32.120 --> 06:33.760
And you really want to go back?

06:33.880 --> 06:36.583
I get it... it's a fraught
subject for you.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.616
You saw a lot of
friends die over there

06:38.640 --> 06:41.160
and you want to believe
that their sacrifice was meaningful.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.221
But knowing what you know now,

06:44.221 --> 06:47.021
would you really send them all over again?

06:48.447 --> 06:50.520
What, it's funny?
Am I funny to you?

06:50.640 --> 06:53.304
Why can't we just talk
about music or something?

06:53.304 --> 06:56.749
I mean, do you ever just go to movies?

06:56.920 --> 06:58.264
Try turning this thing off?

06:58.264 --> 07:00.176
Joe, I feel bad for the hamster.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.723
I am serious. It's not long before
Sammy is old enough to go there himself.

07:03.723 --> 07:04.696
Would you let him go?

07:04.728 --> 07:07.040
Yeah, I would...yeah, I would.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.376
Mae, she wouldn't allow it.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.200
But if it were up to me, absolutely.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.560
How can you possibly say that?

07:19.967 --> 07:24.436
All right Joe, imagine that there is
a man drowning in this river.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.356
You don't know the guy.
He's nobody to you.

07:26.381 --> 07:28.043
For all you know he might
beat his wife and his kids

07:28.043 --> 07:30.376
and maybe the world's a
better-off place without him.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.345
But all you know is that there is a
human being screaming over there

07:34.501 --> 07:35.798
and you hear him.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.625
So what do you do? Do you
just stand and watch him die?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.491
Or do you jump in
and try to save his life?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.660
All right, err...

07:43.660 --> 07:45.453
The current is too fast.

07:45.453 --> 07:48.016
So if I jump in there's a good
chance that we both drown.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.852
So I would err...

07:49.852 --> 07:53.860
find a long branch and
use it to pull him out.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.880
And there's the difference
between you and me, Joe.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.981
Okay, so you find a branch,
or maybe you don't.

07:59.981 --> 08:02.376
Maybe you pull him out.
Maybe the branch snaps.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.880
Maybe he drowns before
he can grab a hold of it.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.758
But whatever happens you tell yourself
that you did everything that you could.

08:08.758 --> 08:10.874
But that's a lie because
you didn't risk anything.

08:10.899 --> 08:12.600
So you would just jump in?
- Without a second thought

08:12.625 --> 08:14.297
It's reckless.
- Life is not always safe.

08:14.322 --> 08:15.344
You would probably die

08:15.369 --> 08:19.560
Maybe. But if I lived
I wouldn't have any regrets.

08:19.680 --> 08:24.907
That's what I want for my sons.
That's what I want for my friends.

08:24.937 --> 08:25.897
Do you know what
your problem is?

08:25.937 --> 08:28.804
You overthink everything.
You don't commit.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.880
Well, indecision just leads to somebody
else's decisions being made for you.

08:31.913 --> 08:35.799
Sometimes you gotta
fucking jump in the river.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.860
It's moving too fast.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.216
We can ride the current downstream.

08:51.247 --> 08:52.928
We've no idea what's downstream.

08:52.928 --> 08:54.200
It'll confuse the dogs.

08:54.231 --> 08:55.201
We'll freeze to death!

08:55.201 --> 08:57.263
Only if we don't drown in the rapids.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.973
Or we can just stand
here and wait to get shot.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.880
What do you want to do?

09:28.995 --> 09:32.240
What is it? Hey?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.640
Are you okay?
Hey. Hey...

09:37.520 --> 09:43.160
Look at me. You're okay.
You're okay.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.233
I've got you. I've got you.
You're okay.

09:46.233 --> 09:49.186
Say it, say that you're okay.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.880
Okay.
- You're okay.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.480
Did you have a bad dream?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.480
Hey, it's okay.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.480
Look at me.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.680
You're back in real life, okay?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.797
We're at your lake house.

10:11.797 --> 10:14.530
We are together,
everything is good, okay?

10:15.600 --> 10:18.120
Come here. It's okay.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.040
It was just a dream.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.480
Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.466
I have got you.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.080
It's okay.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.120
What are you thinking about?
- The day we met.

11:01.440 --> 11:05.800
You looked so lost the first
time I saw you, so innocent.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.960
I liked you right away.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.055
I just had a panic attack.

11:13.055 --> 11:16.575
I had to leave the church
before the service was over.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.256
Is that something that
happens to you often?

11:20.256 --> 11:22.325
No, it never happened
to me before.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.360
What do you think caused it?

11:25.480 --> 11:28.378
I don't know. Maybe God was
sending me out to meet you.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.430
Why would God care?

11:31.430 --> 11:34.950
I don't know. Maybe he
wanted me to re-examine my life

11:35.200 --> 11:38.320
or become a better person.

11:38.440 --> 11:45.720
But why would the
all-powerful God you pray to

11:45.840 --> 11:47.480
care at all?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.920
Maybe for the same reason
that we care about our children.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.120
I think...

11:58.280 --> 12:01.353
I think you are
already a good person.

12:01.736 --> 12:02.595
Why?

12:03.440 --> 12:06.600
Because I wouldn't
be with you otherwise.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.640
You dedicate your life to helping
people, you making them safer.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.760
If that's why you like me,
I'd better go to work today.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.880
Reuel?

12:52.080 --> 12:55.120
Who would do such an awful thing?

12:59.120 --> 13:06.120
get the ***, Reuel Abbott

13:08.920 --> 13:12.680
I guess that would be weird, right?
You and I would be stepbrothers.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.206
My mom always wanted
to have more kids.

13:16.206 --> 13:20.034
She had a miscarriage
when I was in third grade.

13:20.280 --> 13:24.760
She and my dad wanted to have
a big family, but after she lost...

13:27.720 --> 13:30.480
Speak of the devil...
Hang on...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.640
Hi mum.
- Hi how are you?

13:34.760 --> 13:38.520
I was just to Anders about you
and Mr. Crane having a baby.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.840
Okay,calm down.
We're just away for the weekend.

13:42.960 --> 13:46.400
Are you having fun?
- I am.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.920
Mr. Crane's a nice guy.
- Yeah, I think so. too.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.815
I want to remind you that you have
that AP English prep class tonight.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.720
Yeah, I know, I know.
- Okay, good. I miss you guys.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.200
I'll call you later.
- Bye bye

14:12.120 --> 14:14.680
Turner and Sirin are together.
I could already be blown.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.956
They're trapped in the woods.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.518
We're jamming all the cell signals.

14:17.518 --> 14:19.714
It's only a matter of
time before we get them.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.720
Fuck!.
- Calm down.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.080
Don't tell me to calm down.

14:24.207 --> 14:26.723
Sirin shouldn't know my name
and shouldn't even know I exist.

14:26.723 --> 14:27.843
Where are you?

14:28.560 --> 14:30.037
Don't worry about me, I'm safe.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.037
You could be in Moscow by morning.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.573
That's not an option.
Moscow isn't part of my plans.

14:35.573 --> 14:38.373
I gotta go.
- I'll call you when I know more.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.080
Okay kiddo, have fun on
your camping trip. I love you.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.741
Was that Anders?
- Uh huh...

14:44.741 --> 14:46.816
Oh my god, did he tell you what he
and Sammy were just talking about?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.600
No, what were
they talking about?

14:48.720 --> 14:51.600
I'm not even gonna go there...
- Okay.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.080
So beautiful.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

14:57.200 --> 15:00.221
You know, I found this place
completely by accident.

15:00.221 --> 15:01.221
Oh yeah?

15:02.200 --> 15:06.200
I was going to meet this guy and
he gave me the wrong address.

15:06.320 --> 15:10.440
And I ended up here, instead of at
where we were supposed to meet.

15:10.560 --> 15:15.240
Life just seemed so simple. I wanted
a piece of that simplicity for myself.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.360
I can see why.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.330
Are you hungry,
do you want breakfast?

15:21.439 --> 15:24.353
Yes, what are you making?

17:18.640 --> 17:21.720
There, you can bring it to him now.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.560
You're the boss, but do you think
it's a good idea to torment him like this?

17:24.680 --> 17:26.280
You're right.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.200
About you being the boss?

17:55.600 --> 17:58.680
Is this your handiwork, Robin?

18:01.160 --> 18:03.800
Why are you making this so personal?

18:05.870 --> 18:08.401
Is it because your husband
left you for another man?

18:09.240 --> 18:15.232
Not that that part matters,
but is that what this is about?

18:18.960 --> 18:23.280
You see me with my happy family...

18:23.400 --> 18:29.320
and you want to drag us
down with you. Is that it?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.840
Well, you won't succeed.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.440
I didn't do what you say I did
and you're not going to break me.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.960
Do you hear me, Robin?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.720
You're not going to break me.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.640
Challenge accepted.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.360
Ma'am, it's about CHS Phoenix.
- What about it?

18:53.480 --> 18:57.120
In the draft box of the gmail
account you use he's sent up an SOS.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.800
What does the message say?

19:00.920 --> 19:03.209
"My people are on to
me. I'm being watched.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.536
I haven't much time.
Requesting asylum."

19:05.560 --> 19:07.640
How shall I handle it?

19:11.456 --> 19:13.699
Phoenix has earned
his retirement.

19:13.699 --> 19:16.216
Initiate protocols.
I'll meet him tonight.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.760
And get me an overwatch for 20.00 hours
- Yes, ma'am.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.000
Boo.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.640
You had me there.
- You were lost in thought.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.276
I was on autopilot.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.869
I heard about a man in Norway.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.640
He had his GPS
set for the Arctic tundra.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.840
These days people do what
their gadgets tell them to do.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.600
I miss the simplicity of floor plans.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.280
I have never been able to read maps.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.880
Do you want to have lunch today?
- Fine.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.760
Cool.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.200
Have you found them?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.280
Got a room?
- What happened to you?

21:46.400 --> 21:49.480
I took a swim in the river.
- With your clothes on.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.820
Yeah, I didn't want
them to get stolen.

21:51.820 --> 21:54.529
So how about that room?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.480
That'll be 60.
- All right.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.560
All right. Thank you.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.011
Do you want to tell
me about your dream?

22:17.011 --> 22:18.628
What dream?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.705
It wasn't that bad, really.

22:24.705 --> 22:27.056
It was bad enough to make
you jump out of bed this morning.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.880
It was just about
someone from my past.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.920
I'm sorry if I scared you.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.173
That old cliché about the
spy's past catching up with him.

22:39.173 --> 22:40.173
Yeah...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.320
Guess my dreams are not
very original, are they?

22:43.440 --> 22:46.920
Don't think that your dreams
are what interest me about you.

22:47.040 --> 22:50.440
Oh yeah? What does
interest you about me?

22:59.760 --> 23:02.040
I have an idea.
- Yeah?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.360
I think...

23:06.840 --> 23:11.240
I know what your idea is.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.640
Let's go fishing.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.400
That's exactly what I thought
you were going to say.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.600
Sorry, I gotta take this.
I'll be right back.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.077
Hey!

23:32.360 --> 23:36.920
So, I heard a rumor that you went away on
vacation and I knew that had to be bullshit

23:37.040 --> 23:40.640
so I'm calling to find out what time
you're coming into the office today.

23:40.742 --> 23:42.980
This is all just getting
to me, you know?

23:42.980 --> 23:45.180
You can't run from your problems.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.964
Aren't you the one who
told me to recuse myself?

23:47.964 --> 23:49.644
That doesn't sound familiar.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.928
So, how much time
do you feel you need

23:51.928 --> 23:53.904
before you can bring
them back to the office?

23:53.960 --> 23:57.600
I'm feeling phantom pain
from losing my right arm.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.640
Aren't you sweet?.
I'll see you Monday.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.480
I'll see you Monday.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.760
Hey man, bum a smoke?

24:29.880 --> 24:34.903
Yes. You're Jefferson, right?
- Huh?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.920
Jefferson High.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.200
No, I'm just passing through.
- Really? You sure look familiar.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.520
No, I get that a lot, though.

24:47.640 --> 24:52.200
I'm getting out of here myself.
-Oh yeah? Where are you going?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.578
I'm not sure yet.

24:53.578 --> 24:58.378
I had a job lined up out in California
for a minute, but it didn't work out.

25:00.526 --> 25:03.057
You know, across the river in D.C.
people no better than you and me

25:03.088 --> 25:05.643
 are making history as we speak.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.329
But this place might as
well be a million miles away.

25:10.751 --> 25:11.751
Yeah?

25:12.760 --> 25:15.880
Hey, mind if I bum
one for the road?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.360
Sure, buddy.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.452
Take two.
- Thanks.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.760
Take it easy.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.240
I need to make a phone call.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.680
There is someone I trust.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.280
I don't trust anybody but you.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.800
Yeah, but we're stuck
in a motel room...

26:56.912 --> 26:58.600
while just over
there across the river

26:58.600 --> 27:01.536
there is an entire
counter-espionage case open

27:01.567 --> 27:02.842
and being worked
by the professionals.

27:02.842 --> 27:06.310
I can at least tell them what we know.
And find out what they know.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.749
Okay.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.935
I didn't start this war.
It was declared on me.

27:37.935 --> 27:40.016
But I sure as hell
don't want to lose it.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.480
Reuel ...

27:41.592 --> 27:43.920
We have to 911 call, right?
- Yes, but...

27:43.920 --> 27:46.336
And voice synthesis
confirms it's him.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.560
Yes, but he's a 17-year-old.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.640
He sent a SWAT team to my home...

27:51.760 --> 27:55.800
...destroyed my lawn.
His age is hardly relevant.

27:55.911 --> 27:58.256
The courts are taking
swatting very seriously.

27:58.256 --> 28:00.736
They're prosecuting cases
with deterrence in mind.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.596
That's good. Maybe our
little friend will be deterred

28:04.596 --> 28:07.216
from future acts of
aggression on his elders.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.280
I'm saying he could go
to jail - for a long time.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.720
Maybe you should
turn the other cheek.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.640
The only justice is God's justice.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.760
Fine, hold off, for now.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.600
Okay, boss.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.800
I've arranged lunch.
- I've got an appointment with Polina.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.320
It is already waiting for us.
Come on, I insist.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.960
The day a fish is caught is the worst
day of its life. Do you know why?

29:20.080 --> 29:23.400
Because it dies and gets eaten.
- Yeah, obviously...

29:23.520 --> 29:26.960
But the other really shitty
reason beyond that is...

29:27.080 --> 29:28.760
Here's is a fish ...

29:30.640 --> 29:33.560
...chasing its prey.
Thinking it's about to eat.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.220
Now, imagine you ordered a cheeseburger...

29:37.220 --> 29:40.096
and you're salivating. You're
about to take that first bite...

29:40.120 --> 29:44.240
and all of a sudden the
cheeseburger eats you.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.922
That's what it feels
like to be a fish.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.680
That really fucked up.
- Right?

30:04.254 --> 30:05.960
Fresh from the oven.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.840
To our good health.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.680
Come on, eat up.
It's sturgeon.

30:48.160 --> 30:53.360
I read about a man
who followed his GPS...

30:53.480 --> 30:56.320
and ended up on the arctic tundra.

31:01.280 --> 31:07.160
I'm sorry, I'm a little tired.
I didn't sleep very well.

31:07.280 --> 31:12.840
I have a leak at home.
Drip, drip, drip. The whole night.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.920
Sorry. What did you say again?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.480
Nothing.

31:31.128 --> 31:33.440
Oh, boy!
Oh Mae, well done.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.377
This guy's got some size to him.

31:35.502 --> 31:38.120
He's going to cook up nicely!

31:38.240 --> 31:41.349
Yes, he would, if I weren't
throwing him back.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.840
Set him free.
- Is this because of what I said earlier?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.400
He can't breathe.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.600
I was gonna make you my famous
bass Benedict for breakfast tomorrow.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.280
I want teacakes.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.603
Okay, give him a kiss
before he goes back.

31:53.603 --> 31:55.936
No thanks. You
can kiss him for me.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.680
Well, this little guy's going
to have a hell of a story to tell.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.720
Well, I guess we're not
going to be fishing buddies.

32:05.847 --> 32:08.370
That's not the kind of buddy
I was looking for anyway...

32:08.370 --> 32:10.604
What kind of buddy
were you looking for?

32:15.720 --> 32:18.520
Is everything okay?
- Yes I...

32:18.640 --> 32:20.140
Let me guess.
You need to take it?

32:20.140 --> 32:21.256
Lady gets a prize...

32:21.280 --> 32:23.007
I'll just meet you
up at the house.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.840
Hey, did you find Vasili?
You all right?

32:30.960 --> 32:32.800
Yeah.
- Where are you?

32:32.920 --> 32:35.480
I can't tell you that.
- Why?

32:36.640 --> 32:42.600
Vasili is not in a very
trusting mood just yet.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.800
I'll come personally.
- No, that includes you.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.480
Why doesn't Vasili trust me?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.452
He guess he figures the mole
could be just about anyone.

32:54.452 --> 32:57.006
And he's feeling very paranoid.

32:57.480 --> 33:01.480
And he is alive, and I think
he'd like to stay that way.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.800
Doesn't he know who the mole is?
Isn't that what started all this?

33:05.920 --> 33:10.480
He was bluffing. He said he
knew that there was a mole ...

33:10.600 --> 33:13.760
Just not who it is.
- How?

33:13.880 --> 33:18.440
His friend told him.
Arcady Volk.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.040
My father was a plumber.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.636
He said you could trace a leak...

33:27.730 --> 33:34.320
by adding different colors to the
water that flows through the pipes.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.840
Then you go to where the leak is
and see what color comes out.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.600
Watch out for the bones.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.840
I knew one of us was
helping the enemy

33:49.960 --> 33:53.440
and I remembered
my father's words.

33:53.560 --> 33:58.800
We gave different code names
for my CIA undercover officer...

33:58.920 --> 34:01.800
to each of our people...

34:01.920 --> 34:08.600
...to find out which of them
kept meeting Robin Larkin.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.199
Are you okay?

34:11.320 --> 34:15.239
You got Canary.
- She's can't breathe.

34:15.368 --> 34:17.984
Yes, that's the intention.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.719
This is the antidote. Admit
what you did, and you get it.

34:22.840 --> 34:26.360
Give it to her.
- Are you a traitor?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.320
She admits it.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.600
Exactly, and this is her punishment.
- Give her the antidote.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.280
Which antidote?

34:36.920 --> 34:39.080
Breathe!

34:53.199 --> 34:54.719
She was working for the CIA.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.640
Why did you make me watch,
you sick bastard?

34:58.760 --> 35:01.280
Sorry, I need to get this.

35:11.435 --> 35:17.120
You fucker, it was you.
- What was me?

35:17.240 --> 35:21.920
You told Sirin about me. Turner
is with Sirin, we just spoke.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.960
Where are they now?
- I don't know.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.494
And I don't care, because Sirin
doesn't know my name.

35:26.736 --> 35:27.736
What?

35:27.962 --> 35:29.650
You don't even remember
what you told him, do you?

35:29.650 --> 35:31.496
You must have been shit-faced.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.379
You told Sirin you had an
asset operating inside the CIA

35:34.379 --> 35:36.446
but you never told him my name.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.560
Sirin's been bluffing.
- I should have told you.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.960
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut!

35:45.480 --> 35:48.440
But you know what, I don't care.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.800
I'm out. I'm done.
I'm retired.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.000
Won't that look suspicious?

35:56.065 --> 35:57.962
My best friend just got arrested
for being a double agent.

35:57.987 --> 35:59.666
No-one's going to
question the timing.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.240
We should talk about it.
-No, no, no.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.133
I'm done talking. You
just about got me burned.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.725
If that got back to Moscow, that
wouldn't look too good for you.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.975
Have a nice life.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.480
What have you got for me?

36:27.600 --> 36:30.080
It's about Thrush's
investigation into you.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.960
The investigation was culminated
without any substantive findings.

36:34.080 --> 36:38.000
I guess it's been reopened.
That will cost you ten.

36:38.120 --> 36:44.000
Pigeons are synanthropes,
like squirrels, raccoons, rats.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.800
They thrive in environments
made by humans.

36:47.920 --> 36:51.160
Generally considered to be pests.

36:51.280 --> 36:55.680
Synanthropes are tolerated, but unloved.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.800
You really hurt my feelings.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.120
Five.
- Eight.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.150
Seven.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.640
Senator Thrush is pursuing an
obstruction of justice charge against you.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.000
How?
- Someone gave a sealed deposition.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.440
Her name is Mae Barber.
That name mean anything to you?

37:19.480 --> 37:21.480
I'll send the money round.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.636
Good, soon. It'll be harder
to do from prison.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.920
Sorry, mom, this is for work.
I'll be right back.

37:36.040 --> 37:40.520
Hello.
- We're going to war. Get ready.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.360
With a 17-year-old boy?
- And the mother.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.654
I know people in
counter intelligence

37:55.654 --> 37:58.096
I know people in the
deputy director's office

37:58.128 --> 37:59.728
These people can
actually protect you.

37:59.752 --> 38:02.367
All those resources
are inside the CIA.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.181
As long as the
mole is out there...

38:05.805 --> 38:09.159
Better if I just disappear.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.240
Hey, I thought you planned
to pay for your passage.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.708
Not with my life.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.942
But you're willing to watch
people pay with theirs?

38:16.640 --> 38:21.522
Not to mention all the people
who are still suffering on your behalf.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.265
History has known
less fair arrangements.

38:26.200 --> 38:31.000
I'm sorry I lied but I've been
helping the CIA for years.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.480
You don't think I was
expendable in their eyes?

38:36.920 --> 38:40.360
When I told them my life was
in danger, they sent you...

38:40.480 --> 38:44.760
and the passport of a man
who doesn't even look like me.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.640
I risked my life
for your country.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.120
Fuck it, then...

39:04.400 --> 39:06.800
We need to get to Volk.
- It's not possible.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.103
It's the only way. He's the only one
who knows the identity of the mole.

39:09.103 --> 39:10.776
You won't get near him.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.840
Maybe, but I think I
know someone who can.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.120
Leave her out of this.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.680
She's done enough. She has
been pushed past her limit.

39:22.800 --> 39:27.640
It's only when we're at the limit that
we discover what we're truly capable of.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.120
The overwatch
team's in place ma'am.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.882
It was said that King
Solomon was especially fond

41:08.882 --> 41:11.741
of a loyal servant
by the name of Ahiah.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.800
One day King Solomon entertained
the angel of death in his court.

41:15.920 --> 41:20.800
And he noticed a strange look on Death's
face when he saw Ahiah pouring wine.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.080
Later, when they were alone,
Solomon asked him about it

41:26.200 --> 41:29.040
and Death admitted that he
had been surprised to see Ahiah

41:29.160 --> 41:32.920
for he was on Death's
list for the very next day.

41:33.040 --> 41:38.000
Later that night, when Death left the
court, Solomon sent his servant away,

41:38.120 --> 41:42.800
insisting that he ride all the way to
Arabia to flee his date with Death.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.760
That was the last time
Solomon saw Ahiah.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.480
But the next time Solomon
saw the angel of death

41:50.600 --> 41:52.960
Death told him a funny story.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.960
I am drunk.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.323
I thought you said you
were never drinking again.

42:01.518 --> 42:02.596
I lied.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.760
He said he was surprised to see
Ahiah that day in Solomon's court

42:07.880 --> 42:11.840
because he hadn't been expecting
to find the servant in Jerusalem.

42:22.720 --> 42:27.680
Thank you. Wow.
- Thank you.

42:27.800 --> 42:31.160
So you have no problem eating
fish if someone else catches it.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.600
You've exposed my hypocrisy.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.840
It must have been fun to
catch this big motherfucker.

42:38.800 --> 42:44.200
This is the biggest fish I
have ever seen. It's gigantic.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.400
The angel of death was surprised
to find Ahiah in Jerusalem ...

42:47.520 --> 42:52.360
because he had been planning
to meet him the next day in Arabia.

42:58.440 --> 43:02.560
It is delicious. Are you going
to take a bite of that salmon?

43:03.880 --> 43:06.360
Yeah, yeah.

43:08.200 --> 43:12.240
So, the wise king in trying to
help Ahiah to escape his destiny

43:12.360 --> 43:16.240
sent his favorite servant to the very
place where death was waiting for him.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.080
I wonder what he did to
the servants he didn't like?

43:19.200 --> 43:21.440
So, what does this story mean?
- Yes?

43:21.560 --> 43:23.480
It means...

43:30.240 --> 43:31.680
Thank you.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.040
Sam Barber?
-Yes.

43:35.160 --> 43:35.980
You're under arrest.

43:35.980 --> 43:39.256
Stand up for me, spin around and
put your hands behind your back.

43:39.287 --> 43:43.646
Stay right there.
Stand still for me.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.680
Ekatarina.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.294
I think we have a
friend in common.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.520
I need your help.
