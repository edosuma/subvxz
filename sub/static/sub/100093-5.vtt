Your Honor, this class action
was illegally solicited.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.568
I am moving to dismiss this case

10:51.610 --> 10:53.278
based on
professional misconduct.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.405
Whose professional misconduct?
Billy...?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.449
Yours, Ms. Solis-Papagian.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.826
- What? Billy...
- Well, if you don't know,

10:59.868 --> 11:01.453
I'm more than happy
to enlighten you.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
(CHUCKLES): Okay.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.999
- JUDGE: Mr. McBride!
- PATTY: Billy?

11:09.294 --> 11:12.089
Your first class representative,
Eugene Bennett,

11:12.130 --> 11:13.548
originally hired you to file

11:13.590 --> 11:15.384
a wrongful death action,
correct?

11:15.425 --> 11:18.929
- Yes.
- But that case wasn't viable.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.014
So you convinced him to go with
a class action instead?

11:21.056 --> 11:23.934
Uh... well,

11:23.975 --> 11:27.396
that is a loaded question

11:27.437 --> 11:31.274
that someone...
should object to...

11:31.316 --> 11:32.734
very quickly.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.403
Mr. Bennett wasn't happy
with the new direction

11:34.444 --> 11:36.279
of his case, was he?

11:36.321 --> 11:40.075
PATTY: Uh, well, his wife croaked,
so he wasn't a really happy man.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.827
SUMI: Permission to treat
her as a hostile witness?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.328
PATTY: Oh, my God, please do.

11:43.370 --> 11:47.207
JUDGE: Granted.
A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.292
- PATTY: I'm on it, Your Honor.
- JUDGE: Not "on it"!

11:49.334 --> 11:51.503
- Yes, Your Honor. Copy, yep.
- Thank you!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.588
SUMI: Was Mr. Bennett happy
with your class action?

11:53.630 --> 11:55.465
(CHUCKLING): I'm gonna need a new pen.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.926
- No.
- So you were afraid to lose him as a client,

11:57.968 --> 12:00.679
and you went on TV
to invite others to be

12:00.720 --> 12:02.597
part of this landmark
class action.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.182
That's not what I...
That's not how I said it,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.185
- and it's not what I said, so...
- Bailiff?

12:15.235 --> 12:18.530
PATTY: Right. So, um, if you,
if you live in Blackwood County,

12:18.572 --> 12:22.451
um, and you don't have working
water in your home,

12:22.492 --> 12:24.286
we want to hear from you,
'cause you could be part

12:24.327 --> 12:26.913
of this, um,
landmark class action.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.833
Sounds like a solicitation
of clients to me.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.669
I mean, you know
that wasn't my intent.

12:32.711 --> 12:36.298
SUMI: Intent or not,
words have meaning.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.593
Didn't Violet Webster
attend your little town hall

12:39.634 --> 12:41.553
and listen to everything
you had to say there?

12:41.595 --> 12:44.556
PATTY: Right. Listen, Fatso,
you were there, so you know...

12:44.598 --> 12:45.599
JUDGE: Counselor!

12:45.640 --> 12:47.684
She is blessed with child.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.311
Let's be very careful.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.229
- SUMI: Thank you, Your Honor.
- Take this outside.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.690
- JUDGE: You're welcome, my dear. - Take it outside.
- PATTY: Listen, you were there.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.067
- Okay. Okay.
- PATTY: You know that we were just looking for witnesses,

12:56.109 --> 12:57.819
- not clients.
- Uh, but you told me

12:57.861 --> 12:59.571
that it was a privileged
attorney-client meeting,

12:59.613 --> 13:01.364
didn't you? Yeah.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.074
You considered
all those people there

13:03.116 --> 13:05.452
prospective clients,
not witnesses.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.329
- That is not accurate.
- Yeah, but when

13:07.370 --> 13:09.331
Mr. Bennett dropped out,
as expected,

13:09.372 --> 13:13.001
you went to Ms. Webster and you
asked her in person, one-on-one,

13:13.043 --> 13:15.504
- to be the face of your class action.
- You.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.339
Didn't you?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.924
(QUIETLY): Yes.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.884
(LOUDER): Yes.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.595
- Your Honor, Ms. Soulless-Papagian...
- Solis-Papagian...

13:23.637 --> 13:25.180
- Solis-Papagian...
- Solis-Papagian...

13:25.222 --> 13:27.140
- Did you take it outside?
- I did. I got rid of it.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.975
- JUDGE: We've got it. Thank you!
- SUMI: We got it!

13:29.017 --> 13:30.852
- PATTY: She don't got it.
- JUDGE: Continue, Ms. Sen.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.562
- SUMI: Ms. Solis-Papagian...
- PATTY: Papagian...

13:32.604 --> 13:35.232
...has just admitted
to soliciting litigation

13:35.273 --> 13:37.692
in violation of the rules
of professional conduct.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.486
She's unfit to practice law,

13:39.528 --> 13:41.613
and cannot be trusted to protect
the interests of the class.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.157
The court must deny
certification

13:44.199 --> 13:46.076
and dismiss this case
with prejudice.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.414
Mr. McBride... any thoughts?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.752
Your witness, Mr. McBride.

13:55.794 --> 14:00.215
COOPERMAN: Drunk and
pathetic sad little man

14:00.257 --> 14:02.634
in a sad little suit.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.554
You don't look so good either.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.888
SUMI: What?

14:06.930 --> 14:09.099
- What?
- SUMI: No, what did you say?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.476
PATTY: Doesn't matter. It...

14:11.518 --> 14:15.146
- (CHUCKLES): Hi.
- Hi.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.157
Hi.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.286
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.584
So...

14:35.625 --> 14:37.669
um...

14:37.711 --> 14:40.171
why, um...

14:40.213 --> 14:42.924
Why-why was the lady
delivering water?

14:42.966 --> 14:47.262
Um... do you mean
why was Ms. Webster

14:47.304 --> 14:49.764
delivering water
when I first got to town,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.766
got stranded
and she picked me up?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.351
Yes. Right.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.981
Mm. Because the residents
didn't have water.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.275
They didn't have water?

15:02.110 --> 15:03.778
- That's terrible.
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.198
And I went with Ms. Webster
on one of her deliveries,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.576
where I saw the problem
firsthand.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.662
And this all happened
before the idea

15:12.704 --> 15:13.913
for the class action occurred.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.755
- It all happened before.
- Yes.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.008
I would go so far as to say that
my interaction with Ms. Webster

15:25.050 --> 15:29.095
was the foundation for the idea
of the class action,

15:29.137 --> 15:30.847
and not a solicitation.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.850
COOPERMAN: Billy boy, it fills my heart

15:33.892 --> 15:36.061
with joy and sparkles

15:36.102 --> 15:39.230
to witness such loyalty
to a partner,

15:39.272 --> 15:43.151
even a bottle-blonde loser
ambulance chaser. (LAUGHS)

15:43.193 --> 15:45.654
Why don't you shut your
fucking trap about her.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.866
All I said was that the witness
is clearly leading

15:49.908 --> 15:51.076
her own examination.

15:51.117 --> 15:55.413
- No.
- I will allow it for now, Ms. Sen,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.874
but, Mr. McBride,

15:57.916 --> 16:00.543
you seem very distracted.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.421
(LOUD CLICKING)

16:05.215 --> 16:06.299
He abandoned me.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.718
He'll abandon you,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.763
just as he has
all those he's loved.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.266
And someday very soon,

16:15.308 --> 16:19.729
he'll die, lost and alone.

16:19.771 --> 16:24.609
A sad ending to the sad tale
of the town drunk.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.195
Amen!

16:27.237 --> 16:30.198
JUDGE: Mr. McBride!

16:37.288 --> 16:39.499
I know I never said goodbye.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.794
I didn't say goodbye either.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.879
Never said who? What?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.798
I didn't say goodbye.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.467
Billy, you know there's no price

16:49.509 --> 16:52.053
on anything you want
to do for free.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.347
That's right.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.851
That's right.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.444
Your Honor?

17:08.486 --> 17:09.529
Yeah?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.614
You see, my-my partner...

17:11.656 --> 17:15.076
You don't know...
You don't know my partner.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.619
It doesn't matter what she said

17:17.662 --> 17:19.873
or she didn't say.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.083
You know, that's not the point.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.586
What is the point, Mr. McBride?

17:27.672 --> 17:31.009
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
Well, the point is that

17:31.050 --> 17:33.386
she saw people were suffering,

17:33.428 --> 17:36.890
and she did something
I-I can't do.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.519
They didn't have any water.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.354
And she needed to help them.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.149
JUDGE: And?

17:48.234 --> 17:51.196
(WHISPERS): No more questions?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.281
No-no more questions.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.286
Well, that was something.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.999
Take a seat, Mr. McBride.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.848
(SIGHS)

18:18.890 --> 18:21.351
JUDGE: I believe you
gave it your best shot.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.894
But...

18:22.936 --> 18:26.272
I also think
you solicited your class.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.607
(QUIETLY): Oh, shit.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.776
JUDGE: I am gonna rule
in favor of the defense

18:29.818 --> 18:31.653
and grant their motion
to dismiss.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.198
I am also going to contact
the state bar.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.909
- This kind of behavior...
- Your Honor, I'll do it for free.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.410
JUDGE: Pardon me?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.162
I said I'll do it for free.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.123
There's no prohibition against
solicitation in pro bono,

18:44.165 --> 18:45.500
so I'll do it for free.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.048
Well...

18:54.092 --> 18:56.719
As long as you don't
stand a chance

18:56.761 --> 19:00.807
of making any pecuniary gain,
congratulations.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.809
You got yourself a class.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.853
Your Honor,
you can't be serious.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.646
Take it as a win, Ms. Sen.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.815
You're not going to do better.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.776
Court dismissed.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.027
All rise.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.120
So, I'm officially suing
the water board?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.538
Yeah.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.415
I thought that went very good.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.834
- Okay.
- My God, take me.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.008
The fuck was that?
The fuck was that?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.759
- Look...
- Don't-don't say a word.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.219
Don't say a word, all right?

19:38.261 --> 19:40.305
We're making decisions
separately now as partners.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.181
Right? Again with the pro bono?

19:42.223 --> 19:43.725
- That's not what it was.
- Don't say a word.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.851
Go sleep it off.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.185
I don't want to talk
to you right now.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.354
Something's wrong here,
and I don't know what it is,

19:48.396 --> 19:49.856
but you could at least
give me a chance

19:49.898 --> 19:52.567
to fuckin' talk to you.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.027
Goddamn it.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.878
(PHONE VIBRATING)

20:24.057 --> 20:26.142

- BRITTANY: Hey, Billy.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.311
- Um, listen.
- Yeah.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.814
I just stopped by Denise's dorm
while I was on campus.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.817
Um, when I showed up, Denise was

20:34.859 --> 20:38.863
passed out; middle of the day.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.325
Her roommate said that
she's been drinking a lot.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.786
Like this wasn't the first time.

20:44.827 --> 20:48.623
I'm kind of worried about her.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.999
Is she there with you right now?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.460
No, I put her in the shower.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.671
Yeah, well, tell her to call me.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.466
Okay, but I mean,
you should come down here, okay?

20:58.508 --> 21:00.093
You know, talk in person.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.887
Yeah. Yeah.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.306
Hey, listen,
thanks for taking care of her, okay.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.766
Sure. Of course.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.935
What's wrong?

21:08.977 --> 21:12.897
I think I'm going crazy.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.899
I keep seeing things.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.654
I don't know if
I got a brain tumor,

21:19.696 --> 21:21.364
or I don't know
what happened to me.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.033
But I'm seeing things.
All kinds of things.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.868
Billy, you're scaring me.

21:25.910 --> 21:30.331
I'm sorry, I-I'm not trying
to scare you.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.084
I'm just trying
to tell you the truth.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.338
I love you.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.597
You don't have to say
you love me, too.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.474
I get it. It's okay.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.396
I just wanted you to know.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.276
Listen, you know I care
about you, right?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.278
Yeah.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.323
One thing at a time, okay?

22:04.365 --> 22:06.200
Your daughter needs you.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.954
Yeah, she does.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.249
Just call me when
you get back to L.A.

- I know, baby. I know, baby.
- I'm hungry.

36:28.270 --> 36:31.148
I don't recognize the company
or why they're even paying me.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.317
Um, what's the company name?

36:33.358 --> 36:36.111
Fer-de-lance.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.780
Could you take a picture of the
check and just text it to me?

36:38.822 --> 36:39.990
Yeah, sure.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.618
It-it-it sounds weird, right?

36:42.659 --> 36:45.621
We'll look into it. Don't worry.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.122

- Great.

- Bye.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.543

36:51.585 --> 36:53.337
and a couple drinks.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.213
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.632
That's not nothing, okay?

36:56.673 --> 36:59.718
I just don't want you going down
the wrong road, that's all.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.346
- You of all people.
- Yeah, exactly.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.265
Look, this is how it started
for me when I was a freshman.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.685
It wasn't a problem until, you
know, it suddenly was a problem.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.731
Well, thanks for the
after-school special, guys.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.149
Are we done?

37:14.191 --> 37:16.401
Oh, can you hand me
those things there?

37:19.112 --> 37:21.073
Okay.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.325
What's up with devil bitch
pictures here?

37:23.367 --> 37:25.786
She's a fucking criminal.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.538
- You got to let it go, honey.
- How can you just let her go?

37:28.580 --> 37:31.416
- Why aren't we doing anything?
- What do you want me to do?

37:31.458 --> 37:34.294
- Well, I don't know. You're the genius fucking lawyer.
- Hey, thanks.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.757
It's sick she's not in prison.

37:38.799 --> 37:41.677
I have class.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.470
Well, see ya...

37:43.512 --> 37:45.430
if you ever decide to come back to L.A.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.310

37:50.352 --> 37:53.397

37:53.438 --> 37:55.399
BRITTANY: Oh, remember Gloria
from Gloria's Restaurant?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.608
Yeah, yeah.

37:56.650 --> 37:59.444
She, uh, she received
this suspicious check

37:59.486 --> 38:01.196
- for a lot of money.
- Uh-huh.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.281
I don't know, may or may not
be case-related.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.158
I'll have Marva look into it.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.204
Hey, I'm sorry
I scared you, okay?

38:12.249 --> 38:13.959
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.836
And when I was saying
that stuff to you

38:15.877 --> 38:19.548
on the phone, I... you know,
I was just in a weird...

38:19.589 --> 38:21.383
- Billy.
- ...sort of moment.

38:21.425 --> 38:23.135
It's okay.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.158
Anybody got anything to say
about anything?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.329
Hmm?

38:51.371 --> 38:54.332

behind that.

38:59.171 --> 39:03.008
Hmm? No? Diana?

39:03.050 --> 39:05.844
You got anything?

39:05.886 --> 39:08.305
Why don't you tell us
about your day.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.435
Well, my day,

39:13.477 --> 39:16.396
my day was uneventful.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.982
Visiting a movie set

39:19.024 --> 39:20.650
was uneventful?

39:23.904 --> 39:27.282
(LAUGHS)
You talked to Stephanie?

39:27.324 --> 39:29.868
Mm-hmm. Now I get it.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.328
- Do you?
- Yeah.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.998
Oh, yeah.
Let's talk about it later.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.000
You're making plans
for our future,

39:37.042 --> 39:39.044
that seems like
a family discussion.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.757
Okay,

39:43.799 --> 39:45.967
then let's talk about it now.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.969
Actually, no, I don't,
I don't feel like it.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.805
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.807
Mom, what about
the cake and gifts?

39:51.848 --> 39:52.974
I don't really feel
like that either.

39:53.016 --> 39:55.185
Then what the fuck
do you feel like?!

39:55.227 --> 39:58.271
I feel fucking betrayed.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.524
Gosh, that feels bad,
doesn't it?

40:00.565 --> 40:02.943
(LAUGHING): What, are you gonna
teach me a lesson?

40:02.984 --> 40:06.071
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Old dogs and all that shit.

40:06.113 --> 40:08.365
- No, no, no.
- You can be, you can be a fucking spiteful prick.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.742
Let me ask you something.

40:10.784 --> 40:14.496
When you offered to buy
Roy's land from Stephanie,

40:14.538 --> 40:17.124
whose money were you
planning on using?

40:17.165 --> 40:19.584
Every fucking penny
I made for years.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.837
I will gladly cut you a check
right now

40:21.878 --> 40:24.381
- for services rendered!
- Approaching Stephanie

40:24.422 --> 40:27.592
should've been a discussion
between the two of us,

40:27.634 --> 40:29.553
as a team.
Stop that, Anton!

40:29.594 --> 40:31.888
I do not remember my phone
ringing off the wall

40:31.930 --> 40:33.223
when you talked to her!

40:33.265 --> 40:35.934
Maybe I was going
to surprise you!

40:35.976 --> 40:40.063
Maybe I was going to give you
the signed deed as a gift.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.774
- BLACKWOOD: Maybe, maybe. It's always maybe...
- Because I love you,

40:42.816 --> 40:44.151
- I was gonna...
- ...maybe with you!

40:45.527 --> 40:47.571
Now let me tell you something!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.114
All right.

40:49.156 --> 40:52.367
You let me handle Roy's land.

40:54.452 --> 40:58.498
After the way he went
out of this world,

40:58.540 --> 41:00.959
that's the least you can do.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.409
(EXHALES)

42:16.451 --> 42:18.995
I love both of you very much.

42:20.247 --> 42:22.290

disappointed me,

42:22.332 --> 42:25.710
and that cannot go unpunished.

42:25.752 --> 42:28.588
So, I need both of you
to tell me what you did.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.882
Okay?

42:30.924 --> 42:33.134
And why you're making me
punish both of you.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.238
I failed you.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.489
And?

42:54.531 --> 42:57.492
It won't happen again.

42:59.869 --> 43:01.663

43:55.800 --> 43:58.970
Look, they've been watching me,
now I'm gonna watch them, okay?

43:59.012 --> 44:01.014
That's, that's a terrible idea.

44:01.056 --> 44:02.432
You want to come do it?

44:02.474 --> 44:04.225

51:13.029 --> 51:16.115
(PHONE BEEPS)

51:16.157 --> 51:18.951
And what about me, Donald?

51:18.993 --> 51:23.956
When a rose as lovely
as you blooms,

51:23.998 --> 51:27.627
the bees come, uninvited.

51:27.668 --> 51:31.839
I will pin and mount

51:31.881 --> 51:34.717
every single one of them.

51:35.305 --> 51:41.916
