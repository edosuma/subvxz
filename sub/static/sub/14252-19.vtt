WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.561
No! Make them stop!

00:04.671 --> 00:05.603
Anything?

00:05.672 --> 00:06.661
Nothing of relevance.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.604
His neural pathways
are still fluctuating.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.199
Doc...

00:10.310 --> 00:11.607
Can't you do something?

00:11.678 --> 00:12.610
Look how much he's suffering.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.112
lf l sedate him,
we could lose any chance

00:14.180 --> 00:15.772
of making contact
with the aliens.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.781
Get them out!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.147
Commander, can you hear me?

00:18.218 --> 00:20.778
Focus on the sound of my voice.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.082
l can't understand them,

00:22.155 --> 00:23.622
but they won't stop talking!

00:23.690 --> 00:24.622
What are they saying?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.556
l don't know!

00:26.626 --> 00:28.321
Make them stop! Please!

00:29.362 --> 00:30.761
Janeway to Sick Bay.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.627
Any progress, Doctor?

00:32.698 --> 00:33.631
lt's not going well.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.964
Our ''Ambassador''
is still delusional.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.967
We're running out of time.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.063
The graviton shear
is buckling the hull.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.267
lf we don't find a way
out of chaotic space soon,

00:43.343 --> 00:44.810
we're going to die here.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

02:41.361 --> 02:43.829
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.524
Despite my efforts,

02:45.598 --> 02:48.829
Chakotay's condition
continues to deteriorate.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.200
Doctor!

02:54.607 --> 02:56.097
Yes, Commander?

02:56.209 --> 02:57.904
l'm tired.
l want to sleep.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.569
lf you lose consciousness,

02:59.646 --> 03:02.274
it could sever your link
with the aliens.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.280
Aliens?

03:03.349 --> 03:05.078
The ones who live in this place.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.209
We're trapped here.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.548
They may know a way out.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.554
lt's urgent
that you speak with them.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.647
But l don't understand
what they're saying.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.351
l can try
to help you understand.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.291
l'm going to end up
like my grandfather--

03:15.361 --> 03:16.293
a crazy old man.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.694
No. You're not crazy.
l believe the aliens

03:18.765 --> 03:20.892
are reconfiguring
your neural pathways,

03:21.067 --> 03:23.865
so they can
communicate with you.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.437
Do you remember the day

03:25.505 --> 03:27.769
you were injured
on the holodeck?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.398
ln the boxing simulation?

03:29.509 --> 03:33.377
Yes. You were knocked down,
remember?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.141
l was injured.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.910
l came to see you.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.348
We had an argument.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.045
That's right.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.088
Try to remember more
about the holodeck.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.954
l was sparring
with a Terrellian...

03:46.025 --> 03:47.890
and Boothby was there.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.759
He used to train me
when l was a cadet.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.491
Keep going.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.557
What round was it?

03:55.668 --> 03:58.694
Three. Round Three.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.568
The fight was going badly.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.699
l was avoiding my opponent.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.328
Stay away from the ropes, son.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.261
That's it, that's it.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.635
End Round Three.

04:39.078 --> 04:40.511
That wasn't so bad.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.343
lt was terrible.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.677
Am l missing something?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.479
He barely landed a glove on me.

04:45.551 --> 04:46.882
Mm-hmm.
Give him time.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.511
You're not reading him.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.556
You think he's slow and stupid.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.851
l know better.

04:51.924 --> 04:55.792
ln fact, l know his kind
in my bones. Literally.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.057
l can count the fractures,
if you'd like.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.063
He's not landing any punches.

04:59.132 --> 04:59.996
That's the problem.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.260
You're not letting him.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.834
Have l got this sport all wrong?

05:02.902 --> 05:05.370
Boxing is more
about taking the shots

05:05.438 --> 05:06.598
than dishing them out.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.231
You shouldn't be dancing
away from this fella.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.276
Let him punch himself
out a little.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.244
lt all comes down to the heart.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.440
Do you have the heart
for this?

05:15.515 --> 05:18.643
That's the contest--
it's not against him.

05:18.718 --> 05:23.553
lt's against your own natural
human desire not to get hurt.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.784
That's the real fight.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.553
Begin Round Four.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.685
Go.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.820
Go, go, go.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.001
Stay with him.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.779
Too close. Come on,
come on. Break it up.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.549
Thataboy.
Keep him busy.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.390
Cover up!

06:28.354 --> 06:30.151
How many?

06:36.996 --> 06:39.055
Three.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.599
Good guess.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.693
l've got a good mind to
use a needle and thread

06:44.804 --> 06:46.772
add a little authenticity
to your fun.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.170
Be my guest.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.472
You'd like that--
a manly scar above your eye.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.944
''Chakotay--
the Maquis Mauler.''

06:54.080 --> 06:56.071
Pointless violence.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.617
That program shouldn't
even be in our database.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.845
There's nothing like
a good fight, Doctor.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.151
l was there when Price Jones
went 23 rounds with Gul Tulet.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.088
''The Knockout
in the Neutral Zone.''

07:06.159 --> 07:07.387
Best match l ever saw.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.392
Really?

07:08.461 --> 07:10.258
Most blood spilled?

07:10.329 --> 07:11.990
Or did Price Jones

07:12.064 --> 07:15.261
drive Gul Tulet's nasal bone
up into his brain?

07:16.702 --> 07:17.828
You've got the wrong idea.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.164
The idea is simple enough.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.035
Do enough damage
to your opponent

07:21.107 --> 07:22.574
to render him unconscious.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.338
How's the headache?

07:26.412 --> 07:27.879
lt hurts.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.415
Edema beneath the anterior fossa
of the cranium...

07:31.484 --> 07:33.349
hairline fracture
of the septum...

07:36.689 --> 07:38.384
l saw something strange.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.652
l'll bet you did.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.056
No, before l got hit.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.561
What do you mean?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.826
l looked over at Boothby...

07:46.899 --> 07:49.231
He yelled at me...

07:49.335 --> 07:51.769
l turned back...

07:51.838 --> 07:53.897
Then the ring got distorted.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.802
An hallucination.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.843
You probably had
some pressure building up

07:57.910 --> 07:59.935
along the optic nerves
from a previous blow.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.276
No. l was keeping away
from him the whole fight.

08:02.348 --> 08:03.315
He never touched me.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.044
Hmm.
A number of the ganglia

08:06.118 --> 08:09.144
in your visual cortex
are hyperactive.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.053
Your opponent
wasn't firing on you

08:11.123 --> 08:12.750
with an energy weapon, was he?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.988
Just his gloves.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.586
Chakotay to the Bridge.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.823
On my way.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.798
l want you back in here
for some tests...

08:20.867 --> 08:22.630
unless you want
to be seeing things

08:22.735 --> 08:23.724
on a regular basis.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.876
lt's changed course again--

08:31.944 --> 08:33.639
20,000 kilometers
off starboard.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.515
lon storm?

08:39.585 --> 08:40.677
Not exactly.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.049
lt's two light-years across,

08:42.121 --> 08:44.054
emits enough energy
for a dozen stars.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.353
lt doesn't match any phenomenon
in our database,

08:46.425 --> 08:48.689
and it won't sit still.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.599
Okay. 1 1,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.533
We are too close.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.263
l'm backing us off.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.839
The phenomenon has been shifting
positions every few minutes.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.567
Nothing so massive
could move that fast.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.512
Full reverse.

09:08.581 --> 09:09.548
Maximum shields.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.893
Full stop.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.575
Anybody want to tell me
where we are?

09:37.643 --> 09:41.636
We appear to be
inside the disturbance.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.841
l'm picking up
a lot of raw data--

09:43.916 --> 09:45.679
subspace flux, graviton waves.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.184
Sensors must be confused.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.346
The readings are shifting
around so much, l can't make

09:49.422 --> 09:50.616
heads or tails
of what's out there.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.317
Captain, this is Seven of Nine.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.416
Please report
to Astrometrics at once.

09:56.195 --> 09:59.392
The Borg have been aware of
this phenomenon for many years.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.490
lt's a zone
where the laws of physics

10:01.601 --> 10:04.502
are in a state of
flux-- ''chaotic space.''

10:04.570 --> 10:06.595
Why didn't sensors
warn us in time?

10:06.706 --> 10:09.937
Chaotic space appears randomly
and unexpectedly.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.240
The Borg have observed it
throughout the galaxy.

10:13.312 --> 10:14.870
Then why hasn't
a Federation starship

10:14.947 --> 10:16.209
encountered anything like this?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.045
No doubt some have.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.914
Think of all
the Starfleet vessels

10:19.986 --> 10:22.580
that disappeared under
mysterious circumstances.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.350
Borg vessels
are more advanced,

10:24.423 --> 10:27.586
but only one cube has survived
an encounter with chaotic space.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.127
Those aren't good odds.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.595
lf the physical constants
are shifting,

10:31.664 --> 10:33.154
our sensors can't function.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.358
The problem is here.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.765
Changes in the gravitational
coefficient

10:36.869 --> 10:39.736
will cause sudden shear
forces against our hull.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.705
Shields will protect us,
but only for a time.

10:41.774 --> 10:42.866
How much time?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.738
Unknown.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.835
We've got to recalibrate
the sensors--

10:46.912 --> 10:48.402
redesign them if necessary.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.176
Otherwise,
we're flying blind.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.273
Let's get to work.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.134
Begin Round One.

11:17.209 --> 11:20.144
Computer, did you say something?

11:20.212 --> 11:21.873
Negative.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.963
Pick 'em up, son.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.934
lt's the fight
you've been waiting for.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.566
Begin Round One.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.176
Bridge to Commander Chakotay.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.441
Go ahead, Tuvok.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.745
Please report to the Bridge.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.149
On my way.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.228
Graviton wave displacement
says we're moving at warp 6.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.497
Subspace sensors show
we're standing still.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.503
We can't be that far
from where we entered.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.937
Maybe we should
just set a course,

12:21.073 --> 12:22.597
go to impulse
and see what happens.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.039
What would most likely happen

12:24.110 --> 12:26.101
is a collision with
an asteroid field or a star.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.271
That'd be better
than just sitting here...

12:28.347 --> 12:29.609
Report.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.116
Torsional shear has
increased by 200 percent.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.276
Shields?

12:33.352 --> 12:34.319
Holding.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.179
Like l was saying,

12:38.257 --> 12:39.849
better than just
sitting here waiting

12:39.925 --> 12:40.892
for our hull to breach.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.188
Perhaps we could drop

12:42.261 --> 12:44.229
a series of beacons
to help us navigate.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.558
Now that's an idea.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.498
Did you hear something?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.627
l heard nothing unusual.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.228
l didn't hear anything.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.605
Begin Round One.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.110
l'll plot a course
and we'll take it slow.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.612
What do you think, Chakotay?

13:01.680 --> 13:05.081
The challenger... Chakotay!

13:05.151 --> 13:06.584
Don't you hear that?

13:06.652 --> 13:08.210
Hear what?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.349
Look.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.485
Commander?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.993
Are you all right?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.898
Put on the gloves, son.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.368
l'm not ready.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.371
Commander.

13:27.439 --> 13:31.170
ln this corner,
wearing the red trunks...

13:31.243 --> 13:32.608
Begin Round One.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.211
Bridge to Sick Bay.
We've got a medical emergency.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.966
Mm-hmm.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.399
Let's go to 880 hertz.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.236
Music lessons?

14:03.309 --> 14:05.243
Pretty soon
we'll be singing duets.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.211
l'm checking to see
if there's been any damage

14:07.279 --> 14:09.440
to the auditory nerves--
nothing so far.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.608
His vision checks out as well.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.084
l'm afraid
the source of the trouble

14:14.153 --> 14:16.553
may be a little... deeper.

14:16.622 --> 14:17.987
The family curse.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.046
What do you mean?

14:19.124 --> 14:20.853
Chakotay has the genetic marker

14:20.926 --> 14:23.292
for a cognitive disorder--
sensory tremens.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.729
The primary symptoms are visual
and auditory hallucinations.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.858
My family doctor
suppressed the gene

14:28.968 --> 14:30.299
before l was even born,

14:30.402 --> 14:33.394
so l never had to go through
what the others did--

14:33.505 --> 14:34.733
like my grandfather.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.308
For some reason,
the gene's been switched on.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.207
l'm not saying for certain
that's why Chakotay thought

14:39.278 --> 14:40.768
he was getting ready
for a prizefight,

14:40.846 --> 14:42.814
but it's a good bet;
the holodeck boxing

14:42.882 --> 14:44.907
simulation was fresh
in his memory.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.145
A few misfiring neurons
did the rest.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.187
This chaotic space
we've entered--

14:49.255 --> 14:51.189
could it be stimulating
the gene?

14:51.257 --> 14:53.384
Possibly. The only way
to make certain

14:53.459 --> 14:55.290
would be to get the ship
out of here.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.488
ln the meantime,
the Commander will have

14:57.563 --> 14:58.962
to stay in Sick Bay.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.358
Tuvok tells me
you've got a mean left jab.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.406
Never spar with a Vulcan.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.707
How are you doing?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.412
l'm all right.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.884
When l was a boy...

15:20.953 --> 15:24.389
my grandfather
started seeing things

15:24.456 --> 15:26.390
nobody else could see...

15:26.458 --> 15:29.222
hearing what nobody else
could hear.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.195
He refused treatment.

15:32.798 --> 15:37.497
A couple of hyposprays a day,
that's all he would have needed.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.833
But he was stubborn.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.136
He said
his spirit was in pain...

15:43.208 --> 15:44.937
but that the wound...

15:45.010 --> 15:47.808
must be honored.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.478
Crazy old man.

15:59.558 --> 16:00.991
Ready, Captain.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.355
Janeway to Seven.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.157
Bring the grid back on line.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.662
Stand by.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.790
We've got sensors.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.562
l'm scanning
to 100,000 kilometers...

16:10.669 --> 16:12.364
700,000.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.032
Sensors are stable
to one million kilometers.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.472
We won't be able
to scan any further.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.511
Are you picking up
anything at that range?

16:19.611 --> 16:22.341
No planets, no asteroid fields,
no sinkholes.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.507
Good enough for me.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.141
Set a course dead ahead
one-quarter impulse.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.554
Sensor status?

16:32.624 --> 16:34.785
Continuing to function.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.725
Still nothing ahead.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.057
Good.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.620
Let's increase our speed.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.563
Mr. Paris, go to half impulse.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.895
Wait.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.902
lt's a ship.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.198
Warp capable.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.364
lt's adrift,
and the outer hull is damaged.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.408
No life-signs.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.604
Let's take a closer look.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.511
Computer, let's hear that again.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.812
Why won't you answer?

16:58.884 --> 17:02.217
Did you give up on me
for being so late?

17:02.287 --> 17:03.413
Not my fault.

17:04.556 --> 17:06.183
We got lost in here.

17:06.258 --> 17:09.625
Why do the stars
make such a noise?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.356
Let me sleep.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.624
l don't understand them.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.222
l don't want to talk to them.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.199
l just want to go home.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.372
That was the final
distress call.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.601
According to the vessel's
medical records,

17:23.675 --> 17:25.575
the Captain and one
of his engineers

17:25.644 --> 17:28.374
started hallucinating
after they entered this space.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.541
The physician on board
never found a way to treat them.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.551
How long were
they stranded here?

17:33.619 --> 17:35.052
Almost a year.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.418
Eventually, their systems
were compromised.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.888
They died of exposure.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.289
The sensors on that ship
are more advanced than ours

17:41.360 --> 17:43.260
and they couldn't find
a way out.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.727
Let's hold our position

17:44.797 --> 17:47.561
till we have a better idea
of what we're up against.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.498
lt looks like that's
what they did.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.660
And along the way,
a couple of them

17:51.770 --> 17:53.897
started sounding
just like Chakotay.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.304
l can't believe
that's a coincidence.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.842
Then why hasn't anyone
else been affected?

17:57.943 --> 17:59.274
That's a question
l can't answer.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.743
Not yet.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.781
Request permission to beam
their Captain's body on board.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.340
l'd like to perform an autopsy.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.817
Granted. Pull the sensor
technology off that ship.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.251
Use it to enhance ours.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.687
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.822
l made a deep scan

18:17.930 --> 18:20.956
of the alien's brain tissue
and sensory organs.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.764
The optic and auditory neurons
have been partially stripped

18:24.870 --> 18:27.134
of their normal
protein insulation.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.537
The result--

18:28.607 --> 18:30.404
auditory and visual
hallucinations.

18:30.476 --> 18:33.104
The same symptoms as Chakotay
but a different cause.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.271
Exactly. ln this case,
the gene responsible

18:35.347 --> 18:38.009
for producing protein insulation
was shut down.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.141
By what?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.812
There might be something
in chaotic space

18:41.887 --> 18:44.583
that reacts with DNA--
alters it.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.625
But why it targeted him
specifically and now you,

18:47.693 --> 18:48.717
l can't say.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.489
ls there a treatment?

18:50.562 --> 18:52.587
l can control
the hallucinations using

18:52.664 --> 18:56.395
a neural suppressant,
but, unless l can find

18:56.502 --> 18:58.436
a way to deactivate
that gene of yours...

18:58.504 --> 19:00.335
l need to go
on a vision quest. Captain?

19:00.405 --> 19:02.635
That's not the best
idea right now.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.144
A vision quest taps directly
into your frontal cortex.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.940
lt could agitate your mind.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.275
Or help me control it.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.706
Permission granted.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.550
Very well.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.055
l will ask you to wear
a cortical monitor.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.691
lt will help me keep
track of your vital signs.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.044
Ah-koo-chee-moya.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.707
l am far from the sacred places
of my grandfathers.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.876
l am far from the bones
of my people,

19:46.952 --> 19:50.718
but perhaps there is a powerful
being who will embrace me

19:50.789 --> 19:54.418
and give me the answers l seek.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.066
Grandfather,
what are you doing here?

20:07.172 --> 20:08.799
l, uh...

20:08.907 --> 20:11.899
seem to be... lost.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.374
Just a little lost.

20:13.445 --> 20:15.777
You didn't take your medicine
this morning.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.644
Which medicine are
you talking about?

20:17.716 --> 20:18.648
There are many medicines.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.207
The one the hospital gave us.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.651
Oh, that one.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.246
Where are you going?

20:25.324 --> 20:27.884
My spirit doesn't
want that medicine.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.757
l don't care
what your spirit wants.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.455
You're going to take it.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.361
l don't think so.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.423
Come with me back to the house.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.297
Now why would
l want to do that?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.892
lt's better where l'm going.

20:39.004 --> 20:41.564
lt's more interesting.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.676
Where are you going?

20:45.777 --> 20:49.713
To the place
where my spirit lives.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.121
Grandfather!

21:05.964 --> 21:08.364
Where are you?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.060
Answer me!

21:11.503 --> 21:13.733
Begin Round One.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.158
Begin Round One.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.128
The aliens.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.002
They were there, watching me.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.734
lnside your vision quest?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.777
They were trying
to tell me something.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.004
What was it?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.773
l don't know.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.405
Are they with you now?

21:57.482 --> 21:58.414
Can you hear them?

21:58.483 --> 21:59.415
Yes.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.348
Let them speak to you.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.386
No!
They'll make me go crazy.

22:02.421 --> 22:03.353
You're not going crazy.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.582
They're doing this for a reason.

22:04.656 --> 22:05.680
You've got to trust them.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.586
Stop fighting.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.185
Open your mind.

22:11.263 --> 22:12.730
Let go.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.599
Listen.

22:18.503 --> 22:22.633
Chaotic space...
intersects ours...

22:22.741 --> 22:25.904
at the 18th
dimensional gradient.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.411
Voyager entered through...

22:32.050 --> 22:33.677
a trimetric fracture.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.743
Trimetric fracture?

22:35.821 --> 22:38.585
We must escape,
or we'll be destroyed.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.181
How do we escape?

22:40.258 --> 22:42.590
We've got to alter
our warp field.

22:42.661 --> 22:43.958
ln what way?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.462
Rentrillic trajectory.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.431
Rentrillic?

22:49.534 --> 22:50.728
lt doesn't make any sense.

22:50.836 --> 22:51.860
l can't understand it.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.301
l'm scared l'm losing my mind!

22:53.372 --> 22:54.202
Try to focus.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.399
lt's too much!

22:56.508 --> 22:57.873
l can't! lt's too much!

22:57.943 --> 22:58.671
Chakotay!

22:59.745 --> 23:01.235
Get them out!

23:07.519 --> 23:08.884
First contact?

23:08.987 --> 23:12.548
lt was brief, but he definitely
communicated with them.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.683
Rentrillic trajectory.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.193
Unfortunately,
they never got around

23:16.261 --> 23:17.626
to explaining what that meant.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.425
Could be some sort
of alien geometry,

23:19.498 --> 23:21.363
but we'll need much more.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.334
ls it safe for him
to try to make contact again?

23:24.436 --> 23:26.336
Medically speaking, yes.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.498
The problem is convincing
the Commander of that.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.342
l realize you're frightened...

23:37.416 --> 23:41.284
but you're our only hope
out of this place.

23:41.353 --> 23:45.346
You think this
could risk your sanity.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.517
But your sanity
won't do you any good

23:47.592 --> 23:49.617
if we remain in chaotic space.

23:51.863 --> 23:54.388
l need you to keep
trying, Chakotay.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.263
Will you keep trying?

24:05.744 --> 24:07.143
Keep me posted.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.942
Are you ready to continue?

24:15.487 --> 24:19.014
Try to focus
on the alien voices.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.355
Tell me what they're saying.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.156
l can't hear them.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.491
Are you sure?

24:25.564 --> 24:27.122
Listen carefully.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.537
Maybe we can return you

24:35.607 --> 24:37.802
to a more receptive
frame of mind.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.935
Think back to when
you first heard them

24:40.078 --> 24:41.568
in the vision quest.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.079
What were you doing?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.615
Where were you?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.881
ln a boxing ring.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.888
A strange ring.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.514
Was anyone else there?

24:54.059 --> 24:56.323
Yes.

24:56.394 --> 24:57.520
My opponent...

24:59.364 --> 25:00.558
Kid Chaos.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.996
Describe him.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.274
Tuvok...

25:12.344 --> 25:13.538
move into position.

25:14.913 --> 25:18.371
Thompson and Sharr,
target the midsection.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.509
Ensign MacAlister,
you and l will aim for the head.

25:20.585 --> 25:21.882
Set your phasers to kill.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.716
Not exactly

25:23.788 --> 25:25.881
the Marquis of Queensberry
rules, now, is it?

25:25.957 --> 25:27.254
''Set to kill''?

25:27.325 --> 25:28.622
That's not even Starfleet.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.354
Put down the weapons, son.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.896
Tactical advice from
an Academy groundskeeper?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.090
We fire at your command, sir.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.098
Give that order

25:36.201 --> 25:37.862
and you'll be
out for the count--

25:37.969 --> 25:38.936
the whole lot of you.

25:41.006 --> 25:42.132
Lower your weapons.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.502
Commander...

25:43.575 --> 25:45.167
l said stand down!

25:50.282 --> 25:53.342
We just heard from Vegas,
Mars and Orion lll.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.784
The odds are running 33:1
that he'll outpoint you.

25:55.854 --> 25:57.754
1 1 :1 that you'll be kayoed
by the fifth.

25:57.822 --> 26:01.280
Subspace radio is calling it
''The Disaster in the Delta.''

26:01.359 --> 26:02.553
We can still scratch the card.

26:02.627 --> 26:03.559
l'll call the Doctor.

26:03.628 --> 26:04.959
We'll get you out on a medical.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.055
He's trying to hornswoggle us.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.963
Double-check those calculations.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.002
Let me see that padd.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.161
No. Fine.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.931
Don't want to trust
your friends?

26:14.039 --> 26:15.370
You're on your own.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.722
l'm filing a grievance

26:31.790 --> 26:34.418
with the Delta Quadrant
Boxing Commission!

26:34.492 --> 26:36.517
This bout came out of nowhere!

26:36.595 --> 26:37.892
There's some sort
of scheduling mix-up.

26:38.029 --> 26:39.519
You haven't had
the time to train.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.530
You're not ready!

26:40.599 --> 26:42.829
lf you fight now,
you'll be destroyed!

26:43.935 --> 26:45.129
l can't fight now.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.498
l'm not ready for this.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.537
Come on!

26:47.606 --> 26:49.335
l can't stay here!

27:02.988 --> 27:06.151
l follow your example,
learn from you,

27:06.224 --> 27:07.350
look up to you.

27:07.425 --> 27:08.824
l don't want to lose that.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.724
You'll find another role model.

27:10.795 --> 27:11.989
You'll be okay.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.792
You're my First Officer.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.355
Your duty is to this crew.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.163
lf something happens to me,
you've got to get Voyager home.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.931
Tuvok can take command.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.872
You're being selfish, Chakotay.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.912
l'm doing this for you...
for all of you!

27:31.850 --> 27:34.876
A delusion--
dementia puglistica.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.046
You're punch-drunk, Commander.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.126
A hard shot
to the head and neck,

27:42.193 --> 27:43.717
collapses the carotid artery

27:43.795 --> 27:45.763
and cuts the flow of blood
to the brain.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.264
The hook! The head and neck
twist laterally,

27:48.333 --> 27:50.324
traumatizing
the cerebral tissue.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.666
And who can forget
the upper cut?

27:52.771 --> 27:53.795
The head snaps back,

27:53.905 --> 27:55.770
rupturing tissue
in the cerebellum

27:55.840 --> 27:58.240
and upper spinal cord!

27:58.309 --> 27:59.936
Yes!

28:01.613 --> 28:03.046
And the result...

28:03.114 --> 28:06.709
of all this poetry in motion?

28:06.785 --> 28:08.514
Neurologic dysfunction,

28:08.586 --> 28:11.453
chronic traumatic
encephalopathy,

28:11.523 --> 28:14.151
loss of balance
and coordination,

28:14.225 --> 28:16.693
loss of memory.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.251
Starting to sound... familiar?

28:18.329 --> 28:19.660
Chakotay's fine.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.222
He just needs a little
conditioning, that's all.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.463
He needs to listen
to his doctor

28:25.570 --> 28:27.037
and not to his fantasies.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.835
Step into that arena

28:29.908 --> 28:33.105
and you'll become
what you most fear.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.577
What are you talking about?

28:34.646 --> 28:36.876
Oh, he knows what l mean.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.812
Don't you, Chakotay?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.043
Hmm?

28:40.118 --> 28:42.018
What's wrong?

28:42.087 --> 28:43.452
Victory...

28:43.521 --> 28:45.887
defeat, knockout,

28:46.024 --> 28:47.286
TKO...

28:47.358 --> 28:48.757
it's all beside the point.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.295
We know how it really ends--

28:51.362 --> 28:54.889
''a crazy old man...''

28:54.999 --> 28:56.933
Hmm?

28:59.838 --> 29:02.534
lt's your fate, your destiny.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.107
There's no escape.

29:04.175 --> 29:05.904
You've just got to do your best.

29:05.977 --> 29:08.605
You can't let yourself
give in to your fears.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.977
l'm not afraid!

29:10.048 --> 29:12.414
Who said you were?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.390
l'm sorry!

29:28.099 --> 29:30.090
Please come back.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.609
They got away.

29:40.678 --> 29:42.168
Grandfather.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.874
Where did you go?

29:43.982 --> 29:46.348
Some people
were shouting at me.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.078
They were going for a walk

29:48.153 --> 29:51.520
and they wanted me
to come along.

29:51.589 --> 29:52.681
Oh...

29:52.757 --> 29:54.884
lt's hard to follow them.

29:54.959 --> 29:59.487
Oh, God, they go
to strange places.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.293
l'm supposed to be watching you.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.664
We're going to get in trouble
if we don't go back home.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.432
Be a good boy and go.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.938
We understand.

30:09.073 --> 30:11.541
You have to come with me.

30:13.711 --> 30:16.680
They say you can come with us.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.314
There's nobody else here.

30:20.385 --> 30:24.287
They say you're
just like we are.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.287
l'm not!

30:25.356 --> 30:27.324
l'm not like you.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.958
lt's not so bad.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.489
When you get used to it,
they're not so bad.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.937
They're just a lot of talk.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.168
Sometimes l wish
they were more quiet.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.437
But they like to talk.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.710
Come home.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.686
No.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.312
l'm too tired.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.816
This is a nice place...

31:03.895 --> 31:07.387
a nice place to call home.

31:07.465 --> 31:08.830
Hmm.

31:16.007 --> 31:18.669
Begin Round One.

31:18.743 --> 31:21.143
Did you hear that?

31:21.212 --> 31:22.236
No.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.803
Yes, you did.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.552
There's a lot of them this time.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.249
Tell them to go away!

31:32.323 --> 31:33.756
Go away!

31:35.760 --> 31:38.194
They've got other ideas.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.291
l have to go home!

31:42.367 --> 31:45.268
Wait. They're coming for you.

31:45.336 --> 31:49.102
The challenger-- Chakotay!

31:50.708 --> 31:51.732
Better late than never.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.310
They almost scrubbed the bout.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.343
l'm afraid.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.572
l know you are.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.013
You'd be a liar if you
said anything else.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.515
But l've always been afraid.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.108
l know that, too.

32:01.219 --> 32:04.985
The champion-- Kid Chaos!

32:09.861 --> 32:11.260
That's it!

32:11.329 --> 32:13.297
All over!

32:13.364 --> 32:16.822
The fight's been canceled
on medical grounds!

32:18.970 --> 32:20.460
Put 'em down. Let's go.

32:20.571 --> 32:23.938
l hear there's some bearbaiting
at the arena next door!

32:24.075 --> 32:25.201
Have fun!

32:30.782 --> 32:32.215
He's coming out of it.

32:35.219 --> 32:37.380
You stopped the fight.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.218
You were stuck
in the vision quest.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.257
l've got to go back.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.587
You're going nowhere
but Sick Bay.

32:41.659 --> 32:42.626
Let me go.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.286
Calm down.
lt's over for you.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.954
-No, let me get in the ring!
-Chakotay...

32:46.030 --> 32:48.123
No. Let me back in the ring.
Let me...

33:07.719 --> 33:09.414
200,000 kilometers.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.546
Launch another beacon.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.249
Beacon launched.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.452
l'm reading a shift
of .003 in the graviton shear.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.459
Status?

33:17.528 --> 33:18.893
Shields holding.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.295
Speed is steady
at one-quarter impulse.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.891
Maintain course
and heading, Mr. Paris.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.438
Sensors are functioning.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.769
Our course is still clear.

33:29.841 --> 33:33.538
Captain, l recommend we go
to three-quarters impulse.

33:33.611 --> 33:36.239
lncreasing power to the engines
could affect chaotic space.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.578
There are too many unknowns.

33:38.649 --> 33:41.743
At this speed, we should see
daylight in about two months.

33:41.819 --> 33:43.878
The longer we're
in chaotic space, the longer

33:43.955 --> 33:45.786
we're exposed
to these unknowns.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.882
His logic is undeniable,
Captain.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.392
We should increase our speed.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.052
Finally.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.893
Who am l to dispute logic?

33:53.965 --> 33:55.330
Take a look at this.

33:58.403 --> 34:01.429
lt's the first beacon
we launched three hours ago.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.135
We've been going in circles?

34:05.209 --> 34:08.770
To be precise, one large circle.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.905
Hold our position.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.545
All stop.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.878
Report.

34:19.023 --> 34:20.888
l've applied 10,053 algorithms

34:21.025 --> 34:23.789
to the energy signatures
produced by chaotic space.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.193
There is a pattern.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.562
Order to chaos?

34:28.632 --> 34:30.396
Observe.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.230
An isolinear frequency.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.860
Some kind of signal?

34:33.971 --> 34:36.132
l haven't located the source.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.400
lt may be natural--
a star or quasar

34:38.476 --> 34:41.274
that has managed to survive
in chaotic space.

34:41.344 --> 34:44.337
But it could be a transmission.

34:44.415 --> 34:45.848
Possibly.

34:45.917 --> 34:46.849
Have you tried

34:46.918 --> 34:48.851
the standard language
decryptions?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.512
All of them with no success.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.887
Success seems to be
in short supply lately.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.660
lmpossible.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.735
Captain?

35:06.504 --> 35:09.064
And to think...

35:09.173 --> 35:12.142
that kept me
from getting an ''A.''

35:12.243 --> 35:13.870
lt was the only question
l missed

35:14.011 --> 35:15.638
in exo-genetics my senior year.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.510
The nucleotide
resonance frequency.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.743
That signal was designed
to activate DNA.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.546
lt realigned
his molecular bonds.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.881
Now do you believe me?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.184
They're the ones
who scheduled the fight.

35:25.256 --> 35:26.188
They're promoting it.

35:26.257 --> 35:27.554
They're putting up the purse.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.149
His sensory cortex
is hyperactive.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.353
He's still hallucinating.

35:30.428 --> 35:31.895
lt's not an hallucination

35:31.963 --> 35:33.897
not a vision quest--
it's a prizefight!

35:33.998 --> 35:35.465
Chakotay, do you know me?

35:35.533 --> 35:36.864
Do you know where you are?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.128
l know you, Captain,

35:38.236 --> 35:39.464
but you stopped the fight.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.662
You ruined my career!

35:40.771 --> 35:42.466
Nobody is going to put me
on the card after this!

35:42.573 --> 35:43.904
lt's better for you
to rest, Chakotay,

35:43.975 --> 35:45.943
until we can figure out
why this is happening to you.

35:46.043 --> 35:47.533
They want to contact me.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.634
Who does?

35:48.713 --> 35:50.271
The people who live here.

35:50.348 --> 35:51.542
This will sedate him.

35:51.616 --> 35:52.776
Wait a minute.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.444
You believe somebody
lives here, in chaotic space?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.750
And they're trying
to communicate with you?

35:57.822 --> 35:59.915
Yes! l saw him!

35:59.991 --> 36:01.151
Tell me about him.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.726
What does he look like?

36:02.760 --> 36:04.318
He's got a couple
of kilos on me,

36:04.395 --> 36:05.657
a few centimeters in height,

36:05.730 --> 36:07.061
but l can take him, Captain!

36:07.131 --> 36:10.498
l just have to stay
off the ropes.

36:10.601 --> 36:14.469
The holodeck boxing simulation
is still strong in his memory.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.632
Obviously, it's the primary
source of imagery

36:16.741 --> 36:18.402
for his hallucinations.

36:18.476 --> 36:22.879
What if those hallucinations
are being induced for a purpose?

36:22.947 --> 36:26.348
Aliens who exist
on some perceptual wavelength

36:26.417 --> 36:28.578
that our senses can't detect

36:28.653 --> 36:31.588
and the only way for them
to communicate

36:31.656 --> 36:34.591
with us is to alter our senses.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.025
Chakotay's bad gene
gave them the opportunity.

36:37.094 --> 36:38.652
What are you proposing?

36:38.729 --> 36:41.095
Remember the derelict ship?

36:41.165 --> 36:44.498
Two of their crew members
claimed they were seeing things.

36:44.602 --> 36:47.264
Was somebody trying
to communicate with them?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.430
Was somebody trying
to warn them, help them?

36:49.540 --> 36:50.507
Or trying to destroy them,

36:50.575 --> 36:51.940
just as they're trying
to destroy us.

36:52.076 --> 36:53.134
Why go through all the trouble?

36:53.211 --> 36:54.143
We're trapped here anyway.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.181
Let me back in the ring!

36:57.248 --> 36:58.545
Even if this is

36:58.616 --> 37:00.243
some kind
of alien communication,

37:00.351 --> 37:01.978
it could harm him permanently.

37:02.019 --> 37:03.714
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

37:03.788 --> 37:04.812
Go ahead, Tuvok.

37:04.922 --> 37:06.719
Graviton shear
has increased again.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.019
Hull pressure is rising.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.354
l'm on my way.

37:09.427 --> 37:10.826
Captain...

37:10.962 --> 37:15.524
when have we ever turned away
from a first contact?

37:21.005 --> 37:23.473
Send him back in the ring.

37:33.951 --> 37:35.077
Report!

37:35.152 --> 37:37.416
Some kind of spatial sinkhole
just opened up beneath us!

37:37.488 --> 37:38.921
Full thrusters!

37:42.793 --> 37:43.725
Status?

37:43.794 --> 37:45.557
We managed to sidestep that one,

37:45.630 --> 37:49.191
but graviton shear has increased
by another 310 percent.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.256
Janeway to Sick Bay.

37:50.368 --> 37:51.266
Sick Bay here.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.666
lt's now or never.

37:52.770 --> 37:53.828
Understood, Captain.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.337
l've got to get in there.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.203
They're about to ring the bell.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.175
l'm going to subject
you to a field

37:59.243 --> 38:01.302
that will enhance
the nucleotide bonds.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.677
The gene should become
fully activated.

38:04.715 --> 38:05.807
Do you understand?

38:05.883 --> 38:08.317
l understand.

38:08.386 --> 38:10.479
Find us a way out of here.

38:10.554 --> 38:11.782
l'll try.

38:29.407 --> 38:30.374
Good idea.

38:30.441 --> 38:31.499
Keep him waiting.

38:31.609 --> 38:33.304
Let him sweat it out.

38:33.377 --> 38:35.743
ln this corner, representing

38:35.813 --> 38:38.213
the Alpha Quadrant,
Earth and humanity,

38:38.282 --> 38:40.546
the challenger, Chakotay!

38:42.820 --> 38:45.015
Everybody loves an underdog.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.856
And in this corner,

38:48.926 --> 38:52.760
champion of the Delta Quadrant,
Kid Chaos!

38:54.832 --> 38:56.094
Looks like he's got

38:56.167 --> 38:58.260
a lot of upper-body
strength-- a real puncher.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.394
Just keep your elbow low
when you throw the right

39:00.504 --> 39:02.529
and don't come in too straight;
you'll be okay.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.073
Where's the scouting report?

39:04.141 --> 39:05.403
We don't know anything
about this guy.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.137
l don't know who l'm up against!

39:07.211 --> 39:08.644
You're up against yourself.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.806
That's all
you've got to remember

39:10.881 --> 39:13.475
and don't raise the elbow.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.348
Begin Round One.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.823
Boothby, where are you?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.060
Still here, son.

39:31.168 --> 39:32.601
l'm not going anywhere.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.412
You... Are...

39:45.483 --> 39:45.972
Far from where...

39:46.050 --> 39:47.540
You... Call home.

39:48.652 --> 39:50.552
You... Are... Lost.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.111
Do you understand?

39:52.189 --> 39:53.884
Yes.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.893
We are far from home.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.895
We are lost.

39:59.029 --> 39:59.757
-Our...
-Home...

39:59.830 --> 40:00.558
ls here.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.889
Our... Home... ls here...

40:03.701 --> 40:04.895
ln chaotic space.

40:05.002 --> 40:07.027
-Chaotic space...
-Chaotic space...

40:07.138 --> 40:08.765
Hang in there, son.

40:08.873 --> 40:09.805
Protect your head!

40:09.874 --> 40:10.898
l understand!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.201
-We are too...
-Alien...

40:12.276 --> 40:13.641
-For you.
-We are too...

40:13.711 --> 40:14.871
-Strange...
-For you.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.503
Maybe we're the ones

40:16.580 --> 40:19.777
who are too alien...
too strange.

40:19.850 --> 40:20.714
-lf...
-You...

40:20.785 --> 40:22.480
-Stay...
-ln chaotic space...

40:22.553 --> 40:24.180
-Chaotic space...
-Chaotic space...

40:24.255 --> 40:25.813
You'll be destroyed!

40:25.890 --> 40:26.948
We know that...

40:27.024 --> 40:28.958
but we can't navigate.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.960
Our sensors don't work
in your space.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.291
20 more seconds!
Don't go down!

40:35.599 --> 40:36.623
-Your...
-Sensors must be...

40:36.700 --> 40:38.190
Realigned...

40:38.302 --> 40:39.564
How can l?

40:39.670 --> 40:40.602
-Your mind...
-Must be...

40:40.671 --> 40:41.695
-Realigned...
-Realigned...

40:41.806 --> 40:42.795
Realigned.

40:42.907 --> 40:43.839
-Your mind...
-Must be...

40:43.908 --> 40:46.172
-Realigned.
-l understand.

40:46.243 --> 40:47.904
End Round One.

40:47.978 --> 40:48.910
Get them out!

40:48.979 --> 40:49.911
Let go, Commander!

40:49.980 --> 40:51.607
l can't take any more punches!

40:51.682 --> 40:53.115
They aren't hitting you.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.481
Duck... feint...

40:54.552 --> 40:55.484
clinch!

40:55.553 --> 40:56.485
Stop fighting!

40:56.554 --> 40:57.521
l can't!
They'll destroy me!

40:57.588 --> 40:58.680
That's a risk
you'll have to take.

40:58.756 --> 40:59.688
You take the damn risk!

40:59.757 --> 41:00.621
They want you.

41:00.724 --> 41:01.656
Why?

41:01.692 --> 41:03.159
Because you have the gene.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.353
The crazy gene.

41:04.428 --> 41:06.123
Yes, the crazy gene.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.028
The aliens are trying

41:08.098 --> 41:09.224
to speak to you,
and the only thing

41:09.300 --> 41:10.426
keeping you
from understanding them

41:10.534 --> 41:12.832
is your own fear--
your fear of losing control,

41:12.937 --> 41:14.234
your fear of the unknown...

41:14.305 --> 41:16.830
The unknown and l
don't want to know.

41:16.941 --> 41:19.910
But we have to know
or we're all going to die.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.036
Allow yourself to hear them
for just a few moments.

41:23.113 --> 41:24.205
Do it for us.

41:24.281 --> 41:27.182
What will happen to me...
when they're done?

41:27.251 --> 41:28.775
You'll be on Voyager...

41:28.853 --> 41:30.718
surrounded by friends.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.119
l can't understand them.

41:32.189 --> 41:33.281
You will.

41:33.357 --> 41:35.154
They're talking too
fast, too many words.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.784
Try to focus
on one word at a time.

41:36.861 --> 41:37.793
Too many words.

41:37.862 --> 41:38.794
-Don't stop.
-l'm scared.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.387
-Let them in.
-l don't want to die!

41:40.464 --> 41:42.455
They won't hurt you!
No one will hurt you!

41:44.401 --> 41:46.961
18th gradient,
trimetric fracture.

41:47.071 --> 41:48.003
Keep going.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.733
We have to modify
our deflector.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.775
We have to induce a paralateral
rentrillic trajectory.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.105
How do we do that?

41:54.178 --> 41:55.440
l think l understand.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.447
lt's making sense.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.607
Where are you going?

41:58.682 --> 42:00.377
l can make
the adjustments myself.

42:00.484 --> 42:02.076
l have to get to the Bridge.

42:02.119 --> 42:05.247
l don't know how much longer
l can keep it in my mind!

42:07.424 --> 42:08.789
-Commander.
-What happened?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.451
He's got a right uppercut
that almost knocked me out.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.460
Move over, Harry.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.461
Hang on, Ensign.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.758
They showed me
how to get out of here.

42:13.831 --> 42:14.763
He's hallucinating.

42:14.832 --> 42:15.764
Out of the way!

42:15.833 --> 42:16.765
Tell us what to do.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.461
l can't! lt's too
difficult to explain.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.093
l'm locking him out.

42:20.204 --> 42:20.898
No.

42:21.005 --> 42:22.597
Give up your post.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.142
He's recalibrating
the deflector dish

42:26.243 --> 42:28.404
and routing it
through the sensor array.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.346
lt must be altered.

42:31.415 --> 42:34.179
Captain, the graviton shear
is increasing.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.151
l'm reading microfractures
on the hull.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.450
Stay and we'll be destroyed.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.888
Activate the deflector--
maximum amplitude.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.687
Bring sensors on line.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.419
Captain...

42:43.494 --> 42:44.483
Do it.

42:49.733 --> 42:50.961
l don't know how,

42:51.101 --> 42:53.092
but the sensors have
found us a course.

42:53.203 --> 42:55.763
Maximum impulse... now!

42:55.873 --> 42:58.842
Captain,
if that course is wrong,

42:58.909 --> 43:00.877
we could breech our hull.

43:00.978 --> 43:02.275
Engage.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.029
We've reentered normal space.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.561
Mr. Paris, resume a course
to the Alpha Quadrant.

43:25.669 --> 43:27.637
Aye, sir.

43:45.723 --> 43:47.190
When l said you should take

43:47.257 --> 43:49.452
the next day or two off,
l thought you'd want to stay

43:49.526 --> 43:50.686
in your quarters
with a good book.

43:50.761 --> 43:52.456
Boxing helps me unwind.

43:52.529 --> 43:53.962
Well, in that case,
report for duty

43:54.098 --> 43:55.224
first thing in the morning.

43:55.299 --> 43:56.493
See you then.

43:58.736 --> 44:02.729
Computer, run Chakotay
Training Program 15-Beta.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.360
Ah, come for a little
more punishment?

44:25.429 --> 44:27.556
Thought l'd spar
for a few rounds.

44:27.631 --> 44:29.531
Uh-huh, after that last bout?

44:29.600 --> 44:31.591
Did you talk to the Doc?

44:31.669 --> 44:33.603
l've got a clean bill
of health.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.195
That's good enough for me.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.102
Okay.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.937
l've been watching him fight.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.603
He falls in too much
when he clinches

44:41.679 --> 44:44.773
and he moves more to his right
than he does to his left.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.941
Well, l'll double up
on the left jabs

44:47.017 --> 44:48.211
and see what happens.

44:48.285 --> 44:50.150
You sure
you're ready for this?

44:51.955 --> 44:53.650
l'm ready.

44:53.724 --> 44:54.691
Okay.

44:55.959 --> 44:57.927
Begin Round One.
