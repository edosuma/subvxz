[Doc reading]

01:00.060 --> 01:04.147
[Donny] Get--
Get it. Get it.
Get the marble.

01:04.688 --> 01:05.982
Oh, yeah!

01:06.066 --> 01:09.861
And the gator chomps
down the last marble
in Gatoropolis...

01:11.196 --> 01:14.365
And he wins the game!
All right!

01:14.741 --> 01:15.992
Good game, Donny!

01:17.368 --> 01:18.953
I'm gonna get a snack.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.373
All of this gulp-gulp-gulping
made me hung-hung-hungry!

01:22.457 --> 01:23.291
Wanna come?

01:24.626 --> 01:25.460
Uh-uh.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.878
I wanna keep playing!

01:27.212 --> 01:29.380
The gators already ate
all the marbles.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.386
So, I'll add more marbles.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.348
I sure hope they're hungry.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.697
[laughs] Nice!

01:57.242 --> 01:58.451
Want a carrot, Doc?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.870
Fresh from the garden.
I just picked them.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.580
No, thanks, Dad.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.083
I just ate a whole
bowl of cereal.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.294
I'm totally full!

02:08.919 --> 02:10.088
[laughs] Okay.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.215
It's good to stop
eating when you're full.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.844
So, we can have these
carrots for dinner instead.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.848
Where are you off to, Doc?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.432
Gatoropolis!

02:21.683 --> 02:25.770
I mean Donny's bedroom
to play Gulpy, Gulpy Gators.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.235
Ah! Gulp it, gulp it,
gulp it, gators!

02:39.284 --> 02:40.326
Oh, no!

02:40.410 --> 02:41.953
There's only one marble left.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.624
Whoever eats it will control
Gatoropolis forever!

02:47.750 --> 02:48.793
Ha!

02:50.587 --> 02:51.796
Huh?

02:53.548 --> 02:54.757
[door opens]

02:55.133 --> 02:57.468
-Hey!
-What's wrong, Donny?

02:57.802 --> 03:00.555
Doc!
This game is broken!

03:00.638 --> 03:01.764
Watch!

03:01.848 --> 03:05.894
I keep chomping at the marble,
but it won't stay in!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.313
Can you fix it, Doc?

03:08.521 --> 03:11.733
I'll do everything I can
to make the gator good as new

03:11.816 --> 03:13.276
and ready to chew...

03:13.776 --> 03:14.694
or chomp.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.822
Or gulp. Thanks, Doc!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.209
The Doc is in.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.432
Well, howdy-do, Doc!

03:44.849 --> 03:46.935
Hiya, Hallie!
Hi, everyone!

03:47.352 --> 03:48.645
Hi, Doc!
Over here!

04:05.703 --> 04:06.704
Uh--

04:10.917 --> 04:13.920
You better shake a leg, Doc!
You got a lotta patients to
help!

04:14.003 --> 04:15.588
Oh, they're not
all patients.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.880
Just this one.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.882
[groans]

04:26.182 --> 04:29.185
Hi! The name's Stuffy.
Stuffy the Dragon.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.354
Nice to meet you!
[yelps]

04:36.234 --> 04:38.403
Hey! Come back here!

04:43.324 --> 04:44.409
[gator] Hey, hey!

04:49.205 --> 04:51.124
Do I look like
a marble to you?

04:52.875 --> 04:53.918
Don't worry, Lambie.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.088
You'll be safer up here
while I look at our new patient.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.675
Time to examine you, Gator.

05:01.050 --> 05:05.221
I think we should do it
in the checkup room
where it's a little safer.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.849
You can call me Gustave.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.560
And don't you go worrying
about a thing, Doc.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.145
They won't hurt nobody.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.773
Gulpin's just what
gulpin' gators do.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.192
[groans]
'Cept for me.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.904
Right now, I just don't
feel like gulping anything.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.490
Can you tell me what
feels bad, Gustave?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.868
Oh, it's my tummy, Doc.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.703
It hurts.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.622
Don't worry, Gustave.
You're in good hands now.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.540
[Chilly]
Doc!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.959
I think a gator got my legs.

05:36.335 --> 05:39.088
But, Chilly,
you're a snowman!

05:39.172 --> 05:40.882
You don't have any legs.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.258
Huh?

05:42.341 --> 05:44.927
Oh... yeah!

05:45.344 --> 05:46.596
Oh, thanks, Doc!

05:46.679 --> 05:49.140
You always find a way
to make me feel better.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.851
[yelping]

05:52.518 --> 05:54.145
[laughing]

05:54.812 --> 05:56.898
Stuffy, I need to give
Gustave a checkup.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.067
Keep an eye on these gators
for me.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.651
You got it, Doc!

06:00.735 --> 06:03.571
The dragon's got it
all under control.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.328
Okay, you gators, listen up!

06:10.661 --> 06:13.956
I'm in charge now-- ahem!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.125
A little respect
for the dragon, please!

What's the point in being
a gulpy gator
if I can't gulp anymore?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
Don't worry!

06:29.931 --> 06:32.183
I'm here to help you
get your gulp back,

Uh, Doc?

Just a sec, Stuffy.
I'm with a patient.

Oh. Right.

-Oh!
-[Doc] Come on, guys.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.635
No chomping at the snowman.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.054
Yeah, what she said.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.266
There. Chomp that!

07:55.933 --> 07:57.185
And that!

07:57.602 --> 07:59.645
Hey! You just gulped
my eraser!

[slurp]
Yummmm!

08:05.568 --> 08:07.361
Don't you guys
ever get full?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.740
Hey! That's it!

08:11.616 --> 08:14.785
Gustave, I think I know
what's wrong with you.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.329
You do?

08:16.412 --> 08:17.413
Yeah.

08:17.872 --> 08:22.710
After I had my snack today,
I was so full,
I couldn't eat anymore.

08:23.044 --> 08:28.090
I think you can't eat
any more marbles because you're
already full of marbles!

08:28.174 --> 08:30.259
You don't say.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.638
There's just one way to find
out if my hunch is right.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.681
Open wide!

08:36.432 --> 08:38.433
Wow! Would you look at that!

08:38.768 --> 08:40.227
[Hallie]
Good golly!

08:40.311 --> 08:42.563
[Doc] You're totally
full of marbles.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.440
I have a diagnosis!

08:44.941 --> 08:48.819
It looks to me like you have
stuffed-fully-osis.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.366
Sounds like a case for
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

08:53.783 --> 08:54.992
Let's see.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.662
Stuffed-fully-osis.

08:57.870 --> 08:58.829
There!

08:59.622 --> 09:03.709
Well that sounds
terrible, Doc!
Just terrible!

09:04.126 --> 09:05.461
Don't worry, Gustave.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.340
Next time you eat,
just remember to stop
when you feel full.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.302
Oh! Stop when I'm full!

09:13.386 --> 09:15.680
That makes a whole lotta sense.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.225
So, all we've got to do now
is get those marbles out of you!

09:19.308 --> 09:21.018
I promise
you won't feel a thing.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.564
And when it's over,
you'll be back to normal.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.232
Screwdriver, please, Hallie.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.567

09:29.819 --> 09:32.738
Yep. You're stuffed
with marbles, all right.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.658
And now it's time
to get you unstuffed.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.913
Whoa! Uh-oh!
Look out.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.206
[Stuffy shouts]

09:44.709 --> 09:45.585

09:51.299 --> 09:52.925
There you go, Gustave.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.302
Good as new!

09:54.844 --> 09:57.179
I sure do feel better.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.724
And you know what,
I'm hungry!

10:05.187 --> 10:07.231
See? Just like
I told ya.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.483
Everything's all
under control!

10:10.234 --> 10:15.197
[gulps] I just gotta
thank you for what
you've done for me, Doc!

10:15.573 --> 10:18.159
Aw, you're welcome, Gustave.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.119
That's what doctors are for.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.706

10:27.585 --> 10:29.086
What's the matter,
Gustave?

10:29.420 --> 10:31.547

loved marbles.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.551
