WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:03.113
WOMAN: <i>I've put the full weight
of the Justice Department</i>

00:03.114 --> 00:05.114
<i>behind this operation.</i>

00:05.115 --> 00:07.649
<i>We'll have eyes, ears and GPS</i>

00:07.650 --> 00:09.785
<i>on Director Munsey 24-7.</i>

00:09.786 --> 00:13.088
<i>He will have no ability to
contact anyone by any means</i>

00:13.089 --> 00:15.523
<i>at any time.</i>

00:19.461 --> 00:23.165
<i>He will have no access
to anything with a signal...</i>

00:23.166 --> 00:25.434
or anything that could be used

00:25.435 --> 00:28.669
<i>as a communication device of any kind.</i>

00:33.042 --> 00:35.511
<i>We'll give him the
appearance of freedom,</i>

00:35.512 --> 00:37.079
<i>monitoring him discreetly,</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:40.373
<i>so no one other than him will know.</i>

00:42.385 --> 00:46.822
Mr. President, I assure
you that Director Munsey

00:46.823 --> 00:48.924
won't be able to renew
a magazine subscription,

00:48.925 --> 00:51.960
much less reach out
to his co-conspirators.

00:51.961 --> 00:54.530
And we're sure we're on
solid legal footing here?

00:54.531 --> 00:56.465
Munsey admitted plotting an illegal coup

00:56.466 --> 00:58.200
against Iran, in direct violation

00:58.201 --> 01:00.502
of Executive Order 12-triple-three.

01:00.503 --> 01:03.372
We have 72 hours to do what we please.

01:03.373 --> 01:04.971
Then the firing squad.

01:06.075 --> 01:08.510
It's still available
to me, isn't it, Mary?

01:08.511 --> 01:10.746
I'll tell the boys

01:10.747 --> 01:13.314
at Terre Haute to start
cleaning their rifles.

01:14.316 --> 01:16.552
- Thank you, Madam Attorney General.
- You bet.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.986
Thank you, Mr. President.
Madam Secretary.

01:19.555 --> 01:21.956
(footsteps departing)

01:23.392 --> 01:24.893
Well,

01:24.894 --> 01:27.129
that buys us a few days

01:27.130 --> 01:28.869
without Munsey's co-conspirators

01:28.870 --> 01:30.584
- knowing that we're onto him.
- In the meantime,

01:30.585 --> 01:32.174
there's an imminent coup
in the works in Iran

01:32.175 --> 01:35.040
- with our fingerprints all over it.
- Secretary Marsh and Munsey

01:35.041 --> 01:37.509
had the full power of the
State Department and the CIA

01:37.510 --> 01:39.878
at their disposal...
whatever they planned...

01:39.879 --> 01:41.179
it's got to be big.

01:41.180 --> 01:43.281
And yet we are completely in the blind.

01:43.282 --> 01:45.884
Maybe we just warn the Iranians.

01:45.885 --> 01:47.051
I know Javani...

01:47.052 --> 01:48.219
he's a pragmatist,

01:48.220 --> 01:50.922
and even with the trust
that we've built up,

01:50.923 --> 01:53.224
without concrete reason
to think otherwise,

01:53.225 --> 01:54.759
he'll assume it's a ploy.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.728
Not to mention Shiraz
and the ayatollahs.

01:56.729 --> 01:58.396
Mm... (sighs)

01:58.397 --> 02:01.599
It'll bury the peace talks
and put us on the road to war.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.134
We need operational details.

02:03.135 --> 02:04.803
Something that we can
take to the Iranians

02:04.804 --> 02:06.256
to prove that we're
not behind the coup.

02:06.257 --> 02:07.272
The task force

02:07.273 --> 02:10.241
has found nothing so far on
Munsey's computers, phone...

02:10.241 --> 02:12.677
The key to any post-coup
structure would be a leader.

02:12.678 --> 02:15.780
I have some ideas who that might be.

02:15.781 --> 02:16.948
I can get into it.

02:16.949 --> 02:18.682
Get into it fast.

02:22.353 --> 02:23.788
Hey.

02:23.789 --> 02:26.477
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

02:26.478 --> 02:27.272
Of course.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.627
I have a lot to tell you
and not a lot of time,

02:29.628 --> 02:33.764
so forgive me for skipping
the sensitivity preamble.

02:34.599 --> 02:36.568
Secretary Marsh was murdered.

02:36.569 --> 02:40.205
And he and Andrew Munsey
were plotting a coup

02:40.206 --> 02:43.308
against the regime in Iran.

02:43.309 --> 02:45.910
I know.

02:45.911 --> 02:49.514
But right now, I need you to
call in the rest of the staff.

02:49.515 --> 02:52.350
Though there is one of them
that I need to speak to first.

02:52.351 --> 02:55.520
Uh, Madam Secretary?

02:55.521 --> 02:57.322
Can I come in?

02:57.323 --> 02:59.290
Of course.

02:59.291 --> 03:03.160
I know I'm not exactly your
favorite person these days.

03:04.496 --> 03:06.396
Hey, Matt.

03:07.966 --> 03:11.402
- Uh, ma'am.
- I saw your car parked out front.

03:11.403 --> 03:14.405
I got the text about going
to the office, so, um...

03:14.406 --> 03:15.874
so, see you.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.407
You bet.

03:21.479 --> 03:23.047
Um...

03:23.048 --> 03:24.815
Thank you.

03:26.384 --> 03:29.354
Daisy, I don't really care,
but if you really believe that

03:29.355 --> 03:31.122
no one knew you guys
were still together,

03:31.123 --> 03:33.157
then I strongly advise

03:33.158 --> 03:35.293
you never go into clandestine services.

03:35.294 --> 03:37.561
Copy that.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.064
And speaking of secrecy,

03:40.065 --> 03:42.667
I came here tonight to apologize for

03:42.668 --> 03:43.968
keeping you in the dark.

03:43.969 --> 03:45.570
If I were you,

03:45.571 --> 03:48.373
I would've skipped that
last press conference, too.

03:48.374 --> 03:51.342
But now I'm gonna come
clean, because I need you.

03:51.343 --> 03:52.810
Okay?

03:52.811 --> 03:54.245
Okay.

03:54.246 --> 03:58.082
Secretary Marsh's plane
crash wasn't an accident.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.951
But-but why?

03:59.952 --> 04:01.786
Why then kill Marsh?

04:01.787 --> 04:03.087
I don't know.

04:03.088 --> 04:04.622
Except clearly it had something to do

04:04.623 --> 04:06.190
with the coup conspiracy.

04:06.191 --> 04:08.493
Help me

04:08.494 --> 04:10.495
figure out who else is behind this

04:10.496 --> 04:13.565
and I promise you we will get
justice for Secretary Marsh.

04:13.566 --> 04:14.799
Sounds like he already got justice.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.702
Sabotaging a plane and
killing the secretary,

04:17.702 --> 04:20.572
three crew members and two DS agents

04:20.572 --> 04:23.341
isn't justice, Jay.

04:23.342 --> 04:25.343
But it is nothing compared to

04:25.344 --> 04:28.046
the bloodbath that's coming
if we can't stop the coup.

04:28.047 --> 04:29.080
What do you need, ma'am?

04:29.081 --> 04:32.350
Based on my knowledge of the Iranian

04:32.351 --> 04:34.085
opposition community,

04:34.086 --> 04:35.954
I've come up with a list of seven

04:35.955 --> 04:37.188
potential coup leaders.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.191
I'm hoping that you can
help me narrow it down.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.594
Uh, it's not Ahadi or
Pejman... Marsh thought

04:42.595 --> 04:45.062
- they were lightweights.
- He was pretty distrustful

04:45.063 --> 04:46.130
of Khorsandi.

04:46.131 --> 04:47.932
He called him the Rat of Ramin.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.534
- Definitely not him.
- Okay.

04:49.535 --> 04:52.070
Well, that's good; we're down to four.

04:52.071 --> 04:53.838
We've got Kadivar, Soroush,

04:53.839 --> 04:55.907
Abdollah and Alinejad.

04:55.908 --> 04:58.076
Let's see if we can
connect any of them to

04:58.077 --> 05:00.445
Secretary Marsh and Andrew
Munsey within the last year.

05:00.446 --> 05:02.112
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:03.748 --> 05:06.484
Does anyone really know
anyone else, really?

05:06.485 --> 05:07.885
I know people.

05:07.886 --> 05:09.921
Yes, but do you <i>really?</i>

05:09.922 --> 05:12.724
Okay, Soroush was in
Toronto on April 10,

05:12.725 --> 05:14.926
same day that Vincent Marsh

05:14.927 --> 05:17.061
was in Ithaca, New York, fund-raising.

05:17.062 --> 05:18.329
They're not too far apart.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.226
Maybe they met somewhere in the middle?

05:20.227 --> 05:22.033
For a romantic tryst in Niagara Falls?

05:22.034 --> 05:24.936
- Oh...
- Cancel the honeymoon suite.

05:24.937 --> 05:26.938
Munsey was in Tampa.

05:26.939 --> 05:29.140
Okay, I'm not ready to
throw Marsh completely

05:29.141 --> 05:31.576
under the bus... I mean, even
though the coup was misguided,

05:31.577 --> 05:33.745
he wasn't without his good qualities.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.647
And what, pray tell,
might those have been?

05:35.648 --> 05:36.781
MATT: Hold on a second.

05:36.782 --> 05:40.518
Abdollah was in Paris April 22,

05:40.519 --> 05:41.786
Marsh was in Berlin.

05:41.787 --> 05:43.788
Does anybody know where
Munsey was? Was he in Europe?

05:43.789 --> 05:45.923
- April 22?
- Yeah.

05:45.924 --> 05:47.858
The director was at Langley.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.396
Well, say what you want
about Secretary Marsh.

05:51.397 --> 05:52.597
He was a family man.

05:52.598 --> 05:54.465
He was a good father and husband.

05:54.466 --> 05:55.466
Please.

05:55.467 --> 05:57.735
Okay, Alinejad and Munsey

05:57.736 --> 05:59.737
were both in Jamaica
the weekend of May 9,

05:59.738 --> 06:01.673
stayed at resorts on opposite
sides of the island.

06:01.674 --> 06:04.842
- What about Marsh?
- He was on his ranch outside Caracas.

06:04.843 --> 06:06.444
Damn it.

06:06.445 --> 06:08.246
This is useless. I mean, obviously

06:08.247 --> 06:10.081
they never all sat down together.

06:10.082 --> 06:12.283
What was that date again, Jay?

06:12.284 --> 06:14.886
Uh, Jamaica, May 9 to 11.

06:14.887 --> 06:18.456
Secretary Marsh was also
in Jamaica that weekend.

06:18.457 --> 06:21.091
Nadine, I'm looking at
his official schedule.

06:22.527 --> 06:24.328
Which I personally fabricated.

06:24.329 --> 06:26.297
Daisy, whatever good was in that man,

06:26.298 --> 06:29.467
he most definitely was
not a good husband.

06:29.468 --> 06:32.535
But he always said such nice
things about Mrs. Marsh.

06:33.304 --> 06:35.505
Not when he was in bed with me.

06:38.810 --> 06:41.310
That'd be kind of rude, I guess.

06:43.981 --> 06:47.485
Uh, so...

06:47.486 --> 06:50.088
Marsh made an off-the-books
trip to Jamaica

06:50.089 --> 06:52.323
the same weekend as...

06:52.324 --> 06:54.959
Munsey and Alinejad.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.228
Okay, that can't be a coincidence.

06:57.229 --> 07:01.064
I mean, I-I think we have our affair.

07:03.034 --> 07:04.802
I mean, coup leader.

07:04.803 --> 07:07.971
I'll let the secretary know.

07:13.377 --> 07:14.779
HENRY: <i>You get back after 4:00</i>

07:14.780 --> 07:16.647
in the morning and you still have time

07:16.648 --> 07:18.082
to get the Laffy String.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.885
Hey, just because the fate of
the world hangs in the balance

07:20.886 --> 07:23.287
does not mean that we shirk
family birthday tradition...

07:23.288 --> 07:25.923
Do not, don't you dare.

07:25.924 --> 07:27.492
So how is the fate of the world?

07:27.493 --> 07:29.627
- Well, you know as much as I know.
- That bad, huh?

07:29.628 --> 07:31.896
Yay. You guys got the Laffy String.

07:31.897 --> 07:33.464
Well, you only turn 16 once,

07:33.465 --> 07:34.732
- Noodle.
- Yes.

07:34.733 --> 07:36.367
Besides, how else are we going to have

07:36.368 --> 07:39.971
the most epic Laffy String fight ever?

07:39.972 --> 07:42.874
Now that I'm back, you're all going down.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.943
- Oh, no... - No, I'll tell you
who's going down: the Ziglantians.

07:45.944 --> 07:48.012
Today's the day I break
into the Fortress of Night.

07:48.013 --> 07:49.843
Well, enjoy killing Ziglantians
while you can, dude,

07:49.844 --> 07:51.015
because Monday morning,

07:51.016 --> 07:52.884
- you're gonna be back with the humans
- Ugh.

07:52.885 --> 07:53.951
at Monroe Junior High.

07:53.952 --> 07:56.287
Where a wise-ass like you might end up

07:56.288 --> 07:57.922
- (phone buzzing)
- getting whacked like a Ziglantian.

07:57.923 --> 07:59.390
I got public school, okay?

07:59.391 --> 08:01.092
It's better than the freaks at Westmore.

08:01.093 --> 08:02.660
It's so weird you got expelled.

08:02.661 --> 08:04.228
JASON: If by "weird"
you mean "awesome".

08:04.229 --> 08:06.063
Hey, Nadine. What do you got?

08:06.064 --> 08:08.132
Jafar Alinejad, huh?

08:08.133 --> 08:09.567
Timing fits.

08:09.568 --> 08:11.502
They met with him the month after

08:11.503 --> 08:13.171
you committed to the
peace talks with Shiraz.

08:13.172 --> 08:15.373
I have the NSA and INR

08:15.374 --> 08:17.441
- trying to connect him to a coup.
- Well, I can see

08:17.442 --> 08:19.544
Marsh and Munsey going for him.

08:19.545 --> 08:21.179
He's Western-educated.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.047
Decorated Iran-Iraq War veteran.

08:23.048 --> 08:25.249
Served as ambassador to the UK in the '90s

08:25.250 --> 08:26.818
but broke with his government

08:26.819 --> 08:29.654
- when he got disillusioned with
the hardliners. - Lives in exile

08:29.655 --> 08:32.222
in Canada these days, but
his brother Ahmed is still

08:32.224 --> 08:34.525
a brigadier general in
the Revolutionary Guard.

08:34.525 --> 08:37.595
So he already has inroads
to the military.

08:37.596 --> 08:41.599
Let's not forget if we're
right about Alinejad,

08:41.600 --> 08:42.833
he was part of the plot

08:42.835 --> 08:45.002
that led to the murder
of Secretary Marsh.

08:45.003 --> 08:46.637
Of course.

08:46.638 --> 08:48.673
But why don't you meet with him.

08:48.674 --> 08:50.240
Off the books.

08:53.144 --> 08:55.179
You really think he'd give up anything?

08:55.180 --> 08:57.048
No.

08:57.049 --> 08:59.350
But see what you make of him.

08:59.351 --> 09:01.319
Conrad, you're not considering

09:01.320 --> 09:03.454
getting on board with the coup?

09:03.455 --> 09:06.424
I need to consider the best way forward.

09:06.425 --> 09:09.016
No matter the path that led here,

09:09.017 --> 09:11.996
so... let's vet Alinejad.

09:11.997 --> 09:13.030
Really?

09:13.031 --> 09:15.698
Do we have a problem, Elizabeth?

09:16.634 --> 09:18.436
No, sir.

09:18.437 --> 09:20.336
Thank you, Mr. President.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.526 --> 09:44.695
Not bad for a life in exile.

09:44.696 --> 09:48.032
Makes you wonder why he'd
ever want to go back to Iran.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.600
A little thing called power.

09:49.601 --> 09:52.003
Is it really that alluring,

09:52.004 --> 09:53.471
history of mankind notwithstanding?

09:53.472 --> 09:55.506
I understand you left a horse farm

09:55.507 --> 09:57.275
to become Secretary of State.

09:57.276 --> 10:00.877
Well, the president asked,
I answered the call.

10:02.513 --> 10:04.914
Yeah, the power's pretty awesome, too.

10:06.884 --> 10:08.920
Speaking of which...

10:08.921 --> 10:12.256
he's literally riding in on a white horse.

10:12.257 --> 10:13.958
Well, you gonna

10:13.959 --> 10:18.094
lead a bloody coup, confidence is good.

10:20.398 --> 10:23.067
When Ayatollah Ruhmeini
took power, we clashed

10:23.068 --> 10:26.871
on foreign policy and nuclear ambitions.

10:26.872 --> 10:29.206
I quit my post in protest.

10:29.207 --> 10:31.509
Next thing I know, his
henchmen are following me,

10:31.510 --> 10:33.811
harassing my family.

10:33.812 --> 10:36.414
We barely made it out alive.

10:36.415 --> 10:38.883
This same lunatic

10:38.884 --> 10:41.719
still rules my beloved country.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.922
We understand you'd like to change that.

10:46.490 --> 10:49.292
- Do you?
- We know about the coup.

10:50.861 --> 10:52.129
Good.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.999
Really?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.867
Because the U.S. is backing

10:56.868 --> 10:58.970
another path to reconciliation.

10:58.971 --> 11:01.072
You wouldn't be here

11:01.073 --> 11:04.642
if you weren't ready to
back my vision for Iran.

11:04.643 --> 11:07.278
What exactly is that vision?

11:07.279 --> 11:11.949
No more false promises of
redistribution of oil wealth,

11:11.950 --> 11:13.790
a real restructuring of the economy,

11:13.791 --> 11:16.520
fair elections, free trade with the West,

11:16.521 --> 11:18.089
moderation.

11:18.090 --> 11:19.290
Across the board.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.225
Pretty lofty goals.

11:21.226 --> 11:23.260
It's what a vast majority
of the people want.

11:23.261 --> 11:25.997
But it will never happen
under the ayatollahs.

11:25.998 --> 11:27.932
Shiraz is no more than a puppet.

11:27.933 --> 11:30.401
But he is still the president,
and, like it or not,

11:30.402 --> 11:32.269
the, uh, Green Revolution
failed not long ago.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.105
Because I wasn't there.

11:34.106 --> 11:36.836
The people know me. So does
much of the government.

11:36.837 --> 11:38.109
And the army.

11:38.110 --> 11:40.344
They will rally behind me.

11:40.345 --> 11:44.482
My predecessor, Vincent Marsh,
is dead because of your plan.

11:44.483 --> 11:46.150
You shouldn't be so confident.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.251
I had nothing to do with that.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.387
Change is messy.

11:52.923 --> 11:56.260
We can have the Canadians detain you.

11:56.261 --> 11:57.461
But you won't.

11:57.462 --> 11:59.864
Because that would invite chaos.

11:59.865 --> 12:04.601
Which is the opposite of what
you wish for my country.

12:05.503 --> 12:08.606
JACKSON: <i>He's impressive.</i>

12:08.607 --> 12:10.174
- Very.
- I think I'm gonna recommend

12:10.175 --> 12:11.909
to the president that we consider

12:11.910 --> 12:13.444
getting behind this coup.

12:13.445 --> 12:16.147
Well, you might want
to hold off on that.

12:16.148 --> 12:18.082
Realpolitik, Elizabeth.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.017
Forget past atrocities.

12:20.018 --> 12:22.103
- Focus on the future.
- It's the future

12:22.104 --> 12:23.888
that I'm concerned about.

12:23.889 --> 12:25.623
What do you mean?

12:25.624 --> 12:28.259
A few years ago, I had an uncle

12:28.260 --> 12:31.262
who had that same graying in the pupils,

12:31.263 --> 12:32.263
spider veins

12:32.264 --> 12:34.098
around the temples, just like

12:34.099 --> 12:36.267
Alinejad.

12:36.268 --> 12:41.070
I'm afraid Iran's great
savior might be dying.

12:44.919 --> 12:52.854
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.971
I wonder how Benedict Arnold's staff

13:00.972 --> 13:03.974
- fared after the whole treason thing.
- I don't remember

13:03.975 --> 13:05.809
reading about them
in Social Studies class.

13:05.810 --> 13:08.178
I'll wager when they went
looking for their next gig,

13:08.179 --> 13:09.346
they weren't helped much

13:09.347 --> 13:11.782
by Mr. Arnold's letter of recommendation.

13:11.783 --> 13:14.051
All right, I'm the only
one here who didn't work

13:14.052 --> 13:16.420
for Secretary Marsh, so I can't engage

13:16.421 --> 13:17.888
in this delightful pity party,

13:17.889 --> 13:20.891
but I'm pretty sure we all
still have good jobs.

13:20.892 --> 13:22.125
We won't when the scandal breaks.

13:22.126 --> 13:24.127
Corrupt Secretary of State

13:24.128 --> 13:26.730
murdered by a corrupt CIA Director.

13:26.731 --> 13:28.065
DAISY: Not going to play well.

13:28.066 --> 13:31.001
The entire administration
could come tumbling down.

13:31.002 --> 13:33.202
Including the State Department?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.274
Pity party it is.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.810
- So, Nadine...
- Yeah.

13:39.811 --> 13:41.745
- you and Marsh...
- Right.

13:41.746 --> 13:43.313
How long are we talking?

13:43.314 --> 13:44.748
- Matt.
- What?

13:44.749 --> 13:45.782
It's okay.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.084
I am done with secrets.

13:47.085 --> 13:49.319
Since his time as a senator.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.987
Six years.

13:50.988 --> 13:52.756
I am so sorry, Nadine.

13:52.757 --> 13:53.757
Don't be.

13:53.758 --> 13:55.659
He was planning on dumping me

13:55.660 --> 13:58.595
before announcing his
presidential run, so...

13:58.596 --> 14:00.230
one way or the other,

14:00.231 --> 14:02.331
he was gonna get killed.

14:04.901 --> 14:09.072
We're gonna need another round.

14:09.073 --> 14:12.075
ELIZABETH: <i>He's being
treated at Sloan Kettering</i>

14:12.076 --> 14:13.710
for brain cancer.

14:13.711 --> 14:16.111
How bad is it?

14:16.713 --> 14:19.716
He'll be dead within two months.

14:19.717 --> 14:22.819
And as arrogant as Alinejad is,

14:22.820 --> 14:25.088
I agree with him that
he's the only one

14:25.089 --> 14:26.623
that can hold that country together.

14:26.624 --> 14:28.325
Even if the coup succeeds,

14:28.326 --> 14:30.260
odds are the government
will crumble when he dies.

14:30.261 --> 14:31.795
Be another Iraq.

14:31.796 --> 14:33.930
Then we have to make sure
the coup never happens.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.304
(sighing): We still don't have
enough to take

14:35.305 --> 14:36.767
- to the Iranians.
- I'm tired of hearing

14:36.768 --> 14:38.068
what we can't do, Russell!

14:38.069 --> 14:39.803
And we're running out of time.

14:39.804 --> 14:41.905
How the hell are we gonna
get the Intel we need?

14:41.906 --> 14:42.973
Bring in Alinejad.

14:42.974 --> 14:44.608
And what? Waterboard him?

14:44.609 --> 14:46.543
Well, threaten to deport his grandkids,

14:46.544 --> 14:48.777
- for starters.
- (scoffs)

14:50.046 --> 14:54.450
Let me take one more run at Munsey, sir.

14:57.154 --> 14:59.923
- Two months to live, huh?
- It's called

14:59.924 --> 15:02.793
a glioblastoma... it's one of the
fastest moving brain cancers.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.797
ATTORNEY GENERAL: The
president has authorized me

15:04.798 --> 15:06.797
to grant you full immunity,
Director Munsey,

15:06.798 --> 15:08.083
as long as you play ball.

15:08.084 --> 15:09.566
ELIZABETH: Get out of jail free card

15:09.567 --> 15:10.934
for killing the Secretary of State.

15:10.935 --> 15:11.968
You can't beat that.

15:11.969 --> 15:14.237
- I'm humbled. But no, thanks.
- Andrew,

15:14.238 --> 15:16.306
without Alinejad, the coup fails.

15:16.307 --> 15:17.874
You know that.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.476
There's no immunity for what he's got,

15:19.477 --> 15:20.710
but you can save yourself.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.246
Somehow, I doubt your sincerity.

15:23.247 --> 15:25.015
What does my sincerity
have to do with anything?

15:25.016 --> 15:26.016
Not your heart.

15:26.017 --> 15:27.916
Your brain scan.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.453
You think that's tradecraft?

15:30.454 --> 15:31.955
God sakes, Andrew, look at me.

15:31.956 --> 15:34.591
All I see is a cold,
calculating operative.

15:34.592 --> 15:36.827
That's why I have enjoyed
working with you, Elizabeth.

15:36.828 --> 15:38.061
You're gonna spend the rest

15:38.062 --> 15:39.896
of your life in solitary.
Think about that.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.164
Unless Mary here goes for the needle.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.868
Can you give us a minute?

15:52.843 --> 15:54.377
Bess...

15:54.378 --> 15:57.147
you're out of moves.

15:57.148 --> 15:59.850
Tell me about Juliet.

15:59.851 --> 16:01.551
She's your friend. I know.

16:01.552 --> 16:02.652
Was she coerced?

16:02.653 --> 16:03.887
No.

16:03.888 --> 16:04.988
She's a patriot.

16:04.989 --> 16:06.957
(sighs)

16:06.958 --> 16:08.124
How is she?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.993
Righteous.

16:09.994 --> 16:12.629
Look, I think we're done here.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.630
I've got a <i>Real Housewives</i> marathon

16:14.631 --> 16:16.552
to get back to.

16:17.401 --> 16:22.805
I'm sorry we have to end like this.

16:25.976 --> 16:28.343
So am I.

16:36.019 --> 16:37.387
Ah, good.

16:37.388 --> 16:39.789
I'm glad I don't have to wake you up.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.392
I don't like the sound of that.

16:42.393 --> 16:44.594
I've been at the White House.

16:44.595 --> 16:46.496
Yeah, for quite a while.

16:46.497 --> 16:48.498
I had to convince the president that

16:48.499 --> 16:52.168
the only way out of this little
pickle in Iran is to go there.

16:52.169 --> 16:55.238
Please tell me that you
mean for him to go there.

16:55.239 --> 16:56.239
Henry.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.508
No. I have always got your back,

16:58.509 --> 17:01.144
but going to Iran when
there's a coup in the works?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.480
- No, I'm playing the husband card.
- Babe, listen to me,

17:03.481 --> 17:05.548
if this coup moves forward and takes out

17:05.549 --> 17:08.026
the current government,
Iran will become a failed state.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.593
- You know... - Stop. I know you're gonna
say this is what you signed up for,

17:10.594 --> 17:11.929
there are millions of lives at stake,

17:11.930 --> 17:13.589
- but I...
- What part of this do you disagree with?

17:13.590 --> 17:15.224
Okay... there are

17:15.226 --> 17:17.827
God knows how many radicals
who would love to kill you.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.864
That's why it's a secret mission.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.266
They won't even know I'm there.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.434
Okay, look.

17:24.435 --> 17:25.902
The whole point of my going

17:25.903 --> 17:28.471
is precisely because
of the risk. How else

17:28.472 --> 17:30.507
are we going to send the
message that we really

17:30.508 --> 17:32.342
have nothing to do with this coup?

17:32.343 --> 17:34.444
So now you admit... it's risky.

17:34.445 --> 17:36.012
And sanctioned by the president.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.747
You can take it up with
him, if you want to.

17:37.748 --> 17:40.283
Maybe I will.

17:40.284 --> 17:42.552
Henry.

17:42.553 --> 17:44.220
Come on.

17:44.221 --> 17:47.223
I'm gonna be okay.

17:47.224 --> 17:49.893
I love you.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.261
I will be fine.

17:54.230 --> 17:57.567
But just in case I'm not...

17:57.568 --> 17:59.169
Are you really gonna go there?

17:59.170 --> 18:01.071
I think that you should wait a year.

18:01.072 --> 18:02.639
- And there you go.
- To remarry.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.974
Yes, I got that.

18:03.975 --> 18:05.375
I'm not having this conversation.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.810
You'll be a hot commodity.

18:06.811 --> 18:07.944
Oh... (scoffs)

18:07.945 --> 18:08.945
I'm just saying that,

18:08.946 --> 18:10.280
for the sake of the kids,

18:10.281 --> 18:13.717
I think a year is a respectful
amount of time to wait.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.719
Fine. A year. Are we done?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.521
Then there's the question of to whom.

18:18.522 --> 18:19.823
Seriously? You have a list?

18:19.824 --> 18:21.157
More like parameters.

18:21.158 --> 18:24.427
I think we're talking
north of 40 here, with 35

18:24.428 --> 18:27.497
as the floor for somebody
really spectacular.

18:27.498 --> 18:29.065
(chuckles) Okay, I'm not Hugh Hefner.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.401
- 40 is just fine.
- Good.

18:31.402 --> 18:36.306
And while I don't have a
list of <i>approved</i> women...

18:36.307 --> 18:38.675
Oh, my God. You have rejects?

18:38.676 --> 18:40.477
I do. Renee Brown.

18:40.478 --> 18:41.444
Oh, no. What is wrong

18:41.445 --> 18:43.480
with Renee Br... Okay, okay.

18:43.481 --> 18:45.181
You're saving the world. No Renee Brown.

18:45.182 --> 18:46.282
Is there anyone else

18:46.283 --> 18:49.452
- off-limits?
- Maria DeLuca, Denise Chang,

18:49.453 --> 18:53.223
Vera Petrovic, Erin
Blackshaw, Odette Norwood...

18:53.224 --> 18:54.958
Do I need to make my case there?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.993
I won't even accept their lasagnas.

18:56.994 --> 18:59.496
Good. Make sure the kids

18:59.497 --> 19:02.632
don't like new Mrs. McCord
more than they like me.

19:02.633 --> 19:06.436
Well, I'm marrying her, and I
already don't like her, so...

19:06.437 --> 19:09.205
Is that it?

19:09.206 --> 19:10.774
Well...

19:10.775 --> 19:14.710
what else do <i>you</i> think we need to cover?

19:21.017 --> 19:24.419
If this is our last night together...

19:30.026 --> 19:31.861
Computer passwords?

19:31.862 --> 19:34.564
Wow. That is so hot.

19:34.565 --> 19:38.033
(chuckles)

19:39.936 --> 19:41.771
No, it's red, yellow, green, blue.

19:41.772 --> 19:43.306
- What, Mr. Biv? Really?
- Yeah.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.407
My birthday, my rules.

19:44.408 --> 19:46.076
No, you mean OCD. But fine.

19:46.077 --> 19:47.310
Good morning, guys.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.245
Good morning! T-minus one day

19:49.246 --> 19:51.114
till pancakes and Laffy String wars.

19:51.115 --> 19:53.383
- Look what I just dug out of
a box in the garage. - Yes!

19:53.384 --> 19:55.919
What? I love this apron.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.821
You better. You'll be wearing
it tomorrow morning.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.623
- Yeah, listen, Ali, about that...
- Oh, no.

20:00.624 --> 20:03.860
Well, a little work trip
just came up, and...

20:03.861 --> 20:06.429
You know what, let's do the
Laffy String fight right now.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.497
You want to?

20:07.498 --> 20:09.666
We can't do it before my birthday.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.434
We'll just do it when you get back.

20:11.435 --> 20:13.870
Well, it might be a few days.
Are you sure?

20:13.871 --> 20:16.573
Yeah. And Dad will make
pancakes tomorrow.

20:16.574 --> 20:17.841
- It's fine.
- Yes, done.

20:17.842 --> 20:18.842
Okay.

20:18.843 --> 20:19.876
So, where are you headed?

20:19.877 --> 20:21.444
I can't say.

20:21.445 --> 20:25.048
But I will call tomorrow
morning, of course,

20:25.049 --> 20:27.350
and I'll be back before
you know it, okay?

20:27.351 --> 20:29.486
- Okay.
- Be good.

20:29.487 --> 20:31.621
And do not annoy your sister
too much on her birthday.

20:31.622 --> 20:32.822
Give her a little birthday break.

20:32.823 --> 20:34.790
What happened to being true to myself?

20:36.459 --> 20:37.993
Love you.

20:39.195 --> 20:41.965
Keep the world safe for democracy.

20:41.966 --> 20:44.266
I'll try. Bye.

20:47.871 --> 20:51.641
Noodle, I am so bummed about
ditching you on your Sweet 16.

20:51.642 --> 20:54.410
- I feel awful.
- It's fine. Just come back fast, okay?

20:54.411 --> 20:56.812
As fast as I can.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.483
- Ah...! (chuckles)
- Mwah!

21:00.484 --> 21:02.352
Okay.

21:02.353 --> 21:04.487
- ALISON: See you later.
- I love you.

21:04.488 --> 21:06.890
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you! See you later.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.925
Love you.

21:08.926 --> 21:10.160
Red, yellow,

21:10.161 --> 21:11.494
green, blue.

21:11.495 --> 21:13.730
So, last night...

21:13.731 --> 21:15.231
Whew...

21:15.232 --> 21:17.333
We got to pretend it might
be our last time more often.

21:17.334 --> 21:20.870
...I talked to Andrew
Munsey about Juliet.

21:20.871 --> 21:22.972
I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier,

21:22.973 --> 21:26.144
- but with everything going on...
- No. It's okay. What did he say?

21:26.209 --> 21:29.345
That she's righteous.

21:29.346 --> 21:33.316
So... that's good, I guess.

21:33.317 --> 21:35.485
And...

21:35.486 --> 21:38.988
this is mostly about the kids. And you.

21:38.989 --> 21:41.457
A little bit of Juliet thrown in.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.725
You don't have to go.

21:42.726 --> 21:43.693
You can still...

21:43.694 --> 21:45.527
I'll see you in a few days.

21:58.603 --> 22:00.167
Thank you, Marcia. Keep the change.

22:00.168 --> 22:02.266
You bet, Director Munsey.
See you tomorrow.

22:03.068 --> 22:06.504
Don't worry... got extra bear claws.

22:07.973 --> 22:10.476
Uh, I hit the coffee
pretty hard this morning.

22:10.477 --> 22:12.852
Can you see it in your heart
to let me use the bathroom?

22:12.853 --> 22:15.347
Give me a sec.

22:15.348 --> 22:18.783
Come on. You seriously think
I'm gonna <i>Godfather</i> it?

23:13.706 --> 23:17.108
♪

23:42.635 --> 23:45.036
(phone line ringing)

23:47.506 --> 23:49.560
Hello?

23:49.561 --> 23:52.463
Tamerlane needs to move up.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.832
Where have you been?

23:54.833 --> 23:55.866
I'm made.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.401
And they know about Alinejad.

23:57.402 --> 23:58.738
But they don't know anything else.

23:58.739 --> 24:00.369
- You sure?
- Sure enough.

24:01.772 --> 24:02.873
This is the green light.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.476
Tamerlane is a go.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.144
- Copy?
- Copy that.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.345
Tamerlane is a go.

24:12.249 --> 24:14.418
JACKSON: Your little
counterintel plan worked...

24:14.419 --> 24:16.934
we gave Andrew a little breathing room,

24:16.935 --> 24:18.233
and he made a call.

24:18.234 --> 24:19.023
To who?

24:19.024 --> 24:21.458
Someone inside Iran near
the Bandar Abbas Air Base.

24:21.459 --> 24:22.826
I just sent you the coordinates.

24:22.827 --> 24:25.129
- So what was the conversation?
- We don't know.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.164
He used dynamic encryption,
we couldn't bug it.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.233
- What about his side?
- Yeah, he knew we'd be listening.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.501
Drowned it out.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.303
Well, obviously he
called co-conspirators

24:32.304 --> 24:33.704
and told them that he was made

24:33.705 --> 24:35.339
and to go ahead without him.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.207
Unless they called it
off 'cause he's made.

24:37.208 --> 24:40.376
Or moved it up.

24:41.879 --> 24:45.448
Keep your head down, all right?

24:46.550 --> 24:48.018
Zahed.

24:48.019 --> 24:49.920
Elizabeth, please come in.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.455
- Welcome to Iran.
- Mm.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.424
Three words I wasn't
sure I would ever hear.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.527
- Please.
- Thank you.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.896
Allow me to introduce my wife, Marajel.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.165
- Pleasure to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.301
Thank you for having me
in your home secretly.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.036
Must feel a little strange,

25:06.037 --> 25:07.404
- I'm sure.
- It's politics.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.473
I knew what I was getting
into when I married Zahed.

25:09.474 --> 25:10.641
That's good.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.476
I actually kind of
sprang it on my husband.

25:12.477 --> 25:13.744
(both laugh)

25:13.745 --> 25:16.213
I have to say, Marajel, I'm an admirer

25:16.214 --> 25:18.382
- of your work.
- You know my work?

25:18.383 --> 25:21.819
Your three buildings in
downtown Tehran... it's the...

25:21.820 --> 25:22.920
Zarand Commercial Tower.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.563
It's, well, it's my personal favorite.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.622
Really impressive.

25:25.623 --> 25:28.325
I'm impressed that you even
know that I'm an architect.

25:28.326 --> 25:31.295
Former CIA. She studies
her enemies, darling.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.030
(speaks Persian)

25:33.031 --> 25:35.766
- English, Katan. Don't be rude.
- Sorry, Mother,

25:35.767 --> 25:37.101
but is it?

25:37.102 --> 25:38.435
Yes, this is

25:38.436 --> 25:41.438
- my friend, Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord. - Hi.

25:41.439 --> 25:44.308
- My sons Abdol and Katan.
- Nice to meet you.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.243
So you're from the Great Satan?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.544
- (laughs)
- Abdol, really?

25:47.545 --> 25:48.612
A joke, Mother.

25:48.613 --> 25:50.426
- I thought it was funny.
- You're lucky

25:50.427 --> 25:51.882
our guest is forgiving.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.791
Americans can joke about themselves.

25:53.792 --> 25:54.929
It is part of their culture.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.529
Is that not true, Secretary McCord?

25:57.530 --> 26:00.581
Okay, first of all, your English
is better than my kids'.

26:00.582 --> 26:02.149
And secondly, yes,

26:02.150 --> 26:04.618
Americans can laugh about themselves.

26:04.619 --> 26:06.620
Although not enough politicians do.

26:06.621 --> 26:08.922
I understand that you have
three children, Elizabeth.

26:08.923 --> 26:10.891
I do. I have two girls and

26:10.892 --> 26:14.561
I have a boy who's 13,
just about your age,

26:14.562 --> 26:16.797
I bet, yeah? Not quite yet?

26:16.798 --> 26:19.266
Secretary McCord and I
should get down to business.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.401
Hey, don't you boys have homework, huh?

26:21.402 --> 26:22.469
- Come on, now.
- Oh...

26:22.470 --> 26:25.072
- So long.
- Thank you.

26:25.073 --> 26:27.006
Please.

26:28.008 --> 26:29.943
You have a lovely family.

26:29.944 --> 26:32.446
Thank you. But, uh, I know you didn't

26:32.447 --> 26:34.847
come all this way just to meet them.

26:35.716 --> 26:37.985
Our intelligence services have uncovered

26:37.986 --> 26:39.453
a plot against your government.

26:39.454 --> 26:41.622
A coup.

26:41.623 --> 26:43.857
We believe it to be quite credible.

26:43.858 --> 26:46.326
Why couldn't you have just
called to tell me that?

26:46.327 --> 26:49.062
Because at least two high-level

26:49.063 --> 26:51.664
United States officials are behind it.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.401
Who?

26:54.402 --> 26:56.802
I can't divulge that.

26:58.505 --> 27:00.207
But very powerful,

27:00.208 --> 27:02.176
very senior officials.

27:02.177 --> 27:04.244
We don't have the details yet,

27:04.245 --> 27:08.347
but it will be well-planned
and well-executed.

27:09.683 --> 27:13.554
Zahed, these people only play to win.

27:13.555 --> 27:17.024
And their goal is a
complete regime change,

27:17.025 --> 27:19.459
from the ayatollahs down.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.995
And how do I know President
Dalton isn't backing it

27:21.996 --> 27:23.797
and you're here as a smoke screen,

27:23.798 --> 27:25.666
or a hedge if it fails?

27:25.667 --> 27:27.835
I was worried you might think that.

27:27.836 --> 27:30.236
And that's why I came.

27:31.672 --> 27:36.009
With very little security
in order to keep it secret.

27:36.010 --> 27:39.645
I'm basically your hostage,
if you don't believe me.

27:41.915 --> 27:44.084
I do have

27:44.085 --> 27:46.653
one strategic piece of information

27:46.654 --> 27:48.188
that I believe will demonstrate

27:48.189 --> 27:50.089
that I'm on your side.

27:50.757 --> 27:52.192
What is it?

27:52.193 --> 27:54.161
It's the coordinates of a
call that was received

27:54.162 --> 27:55.896
from the man who might
be the ringleader.

27:55.897 --> 27:57.364
In Hormozgan Province.

27:57.365 --> 27:58.899
Near the Bandar Abbas Air Base.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.868
Might be the group's headquarters.

28:00.869 --> 28:04.437
I strongly advise you to
bring this to President Shiraz.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.077
Mmm! Smells good!

28:10.078 --> 28:12.312
Hey, happy birthday.
(kissing)

28:12.313 --> 28:14.147
- Oh...
- Happy birthday, Noodle.

28:14.148 --> 28:15.382
You're wearing the apron.

28:15.383 --> 28:16.617
Yeah, of course I am.

28:16.618 --> 28:18.585
God, how old was I when I made that?

28:18.586 --> 28:20.654
Uh... four.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.756
I think Ms. Janey helped
you out a little bit,

28:22.757 --> 28:25.175
but you did all these letters
yourself, which I still contend

28:25.176 --> 28:26.560
makes you a genius.

28:26.561 --> 28:29.396
I think I'm getting a little
old for these traditions.

28:29.397 --> 28:31.064
Well, if we don't keep doing these things

28:31.065 --> 28:32.599
then they're not traditions, right?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.301
I don't know. With Mom's insane job

28:34.302 --> 28:37.638
and still getting used
to school and the move,

28:37.639 --> 28:40.607
the security guys outside...

28:40.608 --> 28:43.143
You wearing the apron
and making pancakes just

28:43.144 --> 28:44.745
feels like... normal.

28:44.746 --> 28:47.313
Come here.

28:48.982 --> 28:50.484
Things change.

28:50.485 --> 28:53.152
But not me making pancakes
on your birthday.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.757
Is this what it was like
when Mom was in the CIA?

28:56.758 --> 28:58.759
- A little.
- I know that Stevie remembers,

28:58.760 --> 29:01.094
but I was only, like, six when she quit.

29:01.095 --> 29:03.462
Do you know where she is?

29:05.065 --> 29:06.433
Yes.

29:06.434 --> 29:09.636
Tell me. Dad, I'm 16.

29:09.637 --> 29:10.904
Yes, you are,

29:10.905 --> 29:12.606
but the problem with knowing
secret things, Noodle,

29:12.607 --> 29:14.241
is that, then, you know them.

29:14.242 --> 29:17.177
And... they have a way of slipping out.

29:17.178 --> 29:19.980
You're worried about her, aren't you?

29:19.981 --> 29:22.848
(phone rings)

29:23.984 --> 29:25.485
Hello?

29:25.486 --> 29:26.987
Hey.

29:26.988 --> 29:28.088
Happy birthday, Noodle.

29:28.089 --> 29:29.323
Ah, I miss you so much,

29:29.324 --> 29:30.524
I can't stand it.

29:30.525 --> 29:31.792
Thanks, Mom. Where are you?

29:31.793 --> 29:33.427
Not with you. Which is

29:33.428 --> 29:35.829
- such a bummer.
- What are you looking at?

29:35.830 --> 29:37.497
- A room.
- Ah, so you're

29:37.498 --> 29:38.932
somewhere with rooms, are you?

29:38.933 --> 29:40.968
- Really narrows it down, huh?
- What do you see

29:40.969 --> 29:41.935
outside of your window?

29:41.936 --> 29:44.236
A street.

29:45.138 --> 29:46.974
Trees.

29:46.975 --> 29:48.976
Oh. Darn, I've said too much,

29:48.977 --> 29:50.844
didn't I? You couldn't

29:50.845 --> 29:52.879
break Dad, huh? Now you're trying me.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.314
Yup.

29:54.315 --> 29:56.316
Yeah, he's pretty tough.

29:56.317 --> 29:58.885
Especially when he's wearing
the "Chef Dad" apron.

29:58.886 --> 30:00.821
- Say, can I talk to him?
- Sure. Love you.

30:00.822 --> 30:02.723
I love you, too. To the moon.

30:02.724 --> 30:04.523
HENRY: Thank you.

30:05.258 --> 30:06.693
Hey, babe.

30:06.694 --> 30:09.730
- We miss you.
- I miss you, too.

30:09.731 --> 30:11.398
Hey.

30:11.399 --> 30:14.868
Maybe when I get back, you
can model that apron for me.

30:14.869 --> 30:17.604
Au naturel.

30:17.605 --> 30:19.371
I'm not on speaker, am I?

30:24.144 --> 30:26.279
(sighs) Baby, I should go.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.547
I love you.

30:27.548 --> 30:29.049
I love you, too. Bye, babe.

30:29.050 --> 30:30.950
Bye.

30:32.619 --> 30:34.388
- Did you talk to Alison?
- I did.

30:34.389 --> 30:37.423
(speaking Persian)

30:41.728 --> 30:43.196
That was Shiraz.

30:43.197 --> 30:44.898
I gave him the information you provided.

30:44.899 --> 30:47.034
He's already passed it along
to a special army unit,

30:47.035 --> 30:48.568
extremely loyal to us.

30:48.569 --> 30:50.537
(sighs)

30:50.538 --> 30:52.906
I am very glad to hear that.

30:52.907 --> 30:54.975
- How's your daughter?
- Too old.

30:54.976 --> 30:57.210
But if I had to miss her birthday,

30:57.211 --> 30:58.845
there's nowhere else I'd rather be.

30:58.846 --> 31:01.148
Well, I am glad you chose me

31:01.149 --> 31:02.749
as your CIA boyfriend, Elizabeth.

31:02.750 --> 31:04.284
Well, me too. Fortunately,

31:04.285 --> 31:06.720
I've always had good taste in men.

31:06.721 --> 31:08.655
You know, you coming here, um...

31:08.656 --> 31:11.525
Shiraz, Ayatollah Ruhmeini,
the other ayatollahs...

31:11.526 --> 31:13.560
we're impressed.

31:13.561 --> 31:14.995
Especially me.

31:14.996 --> 31:18.665
Well, you took the first step,

31:18.666 --> 31:20.634
coming to see me in DC.

31:20.635 --> 31:22.602
The thought wouldn't
have crossed my mind

31:22.603 --> 31:24.670
to come here, if you hadn't done that.

31:25.872 --> 31:27.874
Elizabeth McCord, I think
this is the beginning

31:27.875 --> 31:30.744
of a beautiful friendship. (chuckles)

31:30.745 --> 31:32.112
Father, I can't

31:32.113 --> 31:33.680
figure out this algebra problem.

31:33.681 --> 31:35.482
- (phone buzzes)
- Oh, been there.

31:35.483 --> 31:38.051
Try again. If you are still
having trouble, I'll help you

31:38.052 --> 31:39.752
- after I'm done...
- (explosion)

31:41.088 --> 31:43.090
- (gunfire)
- Madam Secretary, get down, get down!

31:43.091 --> 31:45.190
- Madam Sec...
- Oh!

31:46.393 --> 31:47.794
Abdol.

31:47.795 --> 31:49.628
(screaming)

31:52.466 --> 31:54.734
Abdol, stay down.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.335
(gunfire continuing)

32:04.845 --> 32:07.313
(gunfire continues, bullets ricocheting)

32:13.319 --> 32:14.854
Where are we?

32:14.855 --> 32:16.088
Sir, the Iranian Army

32:16.089 --> 32:18.290
and the Revolutionary Guard
are fighting elements

32:18.291 --> 32:20.059
among their own ranks
that are well-equipped

32:20.060 --> 32:22.579
- and highly motivated.
- What about Secretary McCord?

32:22.580 --> 32:24.330
We lost touch with her
detail right after

32:24.331 --> 32:26.632
the attack at Minister Javani's house.

32:26.633 --> 32:28.968
How could we just lose
the Secretary of State?

32:28.969 --> 32:30.236
It was a massive assault.

32:30.237 --> 32:32.071
We're getting reports
that Javani is dead.

32:32.072 --> 32:34.340
It's possible that
Secretary McCord's detail

32:34.341 --> 32:35.708
was completely overwhelmed.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.910
Does the State Department
know anything, Ms. Tolliver?

32:37.911 --> 32:39.879
We've been back-channeling
through the Swiss

32:39.880 --> 32:42.148
and Czech embassies in
Tehran, but so far nothing.

32:42.149 --> 32:45.017
I have one of Secretary McCord's
detail on a video feed...

32:45.018 --> 32:46.952
- John Kendall.
- Put it up, Major.

32:46.953 --> 32:49.922
JACKSON: Mr. Kendall, do
you have the secretary?

32:49.923 --> 32:51.490
Negative, sir.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.227
The detail fragmented under the attack.

32:53.228 --> 32:54.555
Fred Cole was killed.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.258
I was forced to take cover.
By the time I was able

32:57.259 --> 32:58.860
to get back to the
house, it was on fire.

32:58.861 --> 33:00.495
Could she have gotten out?

33:00.496 --> 33:02.964
I honestly have no idea.

33:02.965 --> 33:06.934
Now, with the power grid
down, any chance at rec...

33:06.935 --> 33:08.536
What the hell happened?

33:08.537 --> 33:10.671
The Iranians just jammed
all communications.

33:10.672 --> 33:13.307
Admiral Hill, send up a recon team.

33:13.308 --> 33:15.710
I want helos in the air
on the Iranian border

33:15.711 --> 33:17.278
the moment we locate Secretary McCord.

33:17.279 --> 33:18.006
Yes, sir.

33:18.007 --> 33:19.443
Mr. President, we're getting reports

33:19.444 --> 33:21.115
of attacks on government leaders,

33:21.116 --> 33:23.684
including President Shiraz
and Ayatollah Ruhmeini.

33:23.685 --> 33:25.386
Are they dead?

33:25.387 --> 33:26.888
We can't say for sure, sir.

33:26.889 --> 33:28.923
We might be getting behind this thing

33:28.924 --> 33:30.024
whether we like it or not.

33:30.025 --> 33:31.252
MILITARY TECH: BBC's Web site

33:31.253 --> 33:33.687
just went up with news of the coup.

33:33.688 --> 33:34.855
Yeah.

33:34.856 --> 33:37.508
Don't go easy on me, Dad.

33:37.509 --> 33:39.792
If I ever did, and I'm
not admitting anything,

33:39.793 --> 33:41.326
that ends now that you're 16.

33:41.327 --> 33:43.461
Whoa. Coup.

33:43.462 --> 33:45.096
What's cool, J?

33:45.097 --> 33:46.531
No. No, not cool.

33:46.532 --> 33:47.765
A military coup.

33:47.766 --> 33:49.067
Where?

33:49.068 --> 33:50.535
Iran. It's like a civil war there.

33:50.536 --> 33:53.371
Oh, God, just what
the Middle East needs...

33:53.372 --> 33:54.606
more instability.

33:54.607 --> 33:56.608
Right, Dad?

33:56.609 --> 33:58.142
History of the world.

33:58.143 --> 34:00.011
ALISON: Sounds like more work for Mom.

34:00.012 --> 34:01.746
Your move, Dad.

34:01.747 --> 34:03.181
(phone ringing)

34:03.182 --> 34:05.615
Oh. Give me one second.

34:07.619 --> 34:08.553
Hello.

34:08.554 --> 34:11.422
Dr. McCord, it's Nadine Tolliver.

34:11.422 --> 34:13.790
Hey. What's up?

34:17.895 --> 34:19.831
Is she alive?

34:19.831 --> 34:23.094
- Don't give me the company line, Russell.
- I honestly don't know.

34:23.096 --> 34:24.601
Then tell me exactly what you do know.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.170
I'm sorry, Henry, Nadine
already told you everything.

34:26.170 --> 34:28.172
- I want to hear it from you.
- (sighs)

34:28.172 --> 34:30.908
We believe her security
detail was overrun.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.344
How-how is that even possible?

34:33.344 --> 34:34.612
It was a deliberately small footprint.

34:34.612 --> 34:35.780
Deliberately small.

34:35.781 --> 34:37.748
Elizabeth signed off on it

34:37.750 --> 34:39.456
to maintain covert mission integrity.

34:39.458 --> 34:41.760
You and the president knew the risk.

34:41.761 --> 34:42.960
You signed off on it, too.

34:42.962 --> 34:44.929
Yes. I did.

34:44.929 --> 34:46.498
Conrad.

34:46.498 --> 34:49.900
Henry, I want to find her
just as much as you do.

34:49.902 --> 34:53.003
Well, I appreciate that,
but let me be clear:

34:54.005 --> 34:55.940
If she doesn't make it,

34:55.940 --> 34:58.910
and I find out that you
left any asset untapped,

34:58.911 --> 35:01.446
any strategic option unexplored,

35:01.447 --> 35:03.481
if you've missed any
opportunity to save her,

35:03.482 --> 35:05.617
I swear to God, I will
hold you responsible.

35:05.618 --> 35:08.153
Henry, remember who you're talking to.

35:08.154 --> 35:09.554
It's okay.

35:09.555 --> 35:11.955
You find her.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.362
Bring her back.

35:26.389 --> 35:28.523
Hi.

35:30.626 --> 35:33.629
You heard something
about Mom, didn't you?

35:33.630 --> 35:36.265
She's 16 now, Dad.

35:36.266 --> 35:38.234
You should tell her

35:38.235 --> 35:40.803
that Mom is in Iran where
the coup is happening.

35:40.804 --> 35:42.905
How did you know?

35:42.906 --> 35:46.609
I'm not stupid. Neither is Ali.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.878
But she couldn't have
known there'd be a coup.

35:48.879 --> 35:51.748
She was hoping to prevent it.

35:51.749 --> 35:53.448
Is she okay?

35:54.117 --> 35:56.919
I don't know.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.422
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

35:59.423 --> 36:02.357
You guys look serious.

36:03.292 --> 36:05.328
That is 'cause we're seriously

36:05.329 --> 36:07.138
planning a Laffy String
attack on you, dummy!

36:07.139 --> 36:07.964
Oh, no, no, no, no.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.632
- (screams)
- (screams)

36:09.633 --> 36:11.701
Damn the torpedoes!

36:11.702 --> 36:15.138
- The horror! The horror!
- (screams and laughter)

36:15.139 --> 36:16.305
STEVIE: Aah!

36:16.306 --> 36:20.409
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

36:20.410 --> 36:22.578
(indistinct, overlapping chatter)

36:22.579 --> 36:24.647
Can you at least ask if maybe

36:24.648 --> 36:26.282
there's a landline
telephone that I can use?

36:26.283 --> 36:28.217
I have to get in touch
with my government.

36:28.218 --> 36:32.321
- I assure you there is nothing.
- That's not possible.

36:32.322 --> 36:35.057
Your intelligence services
have to be communicating

36:35.058 --> 36:36.425
with the outside world.

36:36.426 --> 36:37.860
Not from here.

36:37.861 --> 36:40.763
Then... maybe something...

36:40.764 --> 36:44.700
If it changes, you get me, like,
an e-mail or text, something.

36:44.701 --> 36:46.335
You're bleeding.

36:46.336 --> 36:49.472
- It's nothing.
- I will get you a medical officer.

36:49.473 --> 36:50.807
(explosion)

36:50.808 --> 36:53.075
(rattling, rumbling, everyone quiets)

36:53.076 --> 36:56.578
(indistinct chatter resumes)

37:09.959 --> 37:13.661
Well, at least Jason
is sleeping peacefully.

37:16.098 --> 37:18.367
Kid's the poster child
for blissfully unaware.

37:18.368 --> 37:20.769
(chuckles) Yeah.

37:22.972 --> 37:27.275
You're good sisters,
protecting him like that.

37:31.247 --> 37:33.916
I don't remember if I
told Mom I love her.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.485
When she called this morning.

37:36.486 --> 37:38.521
She knows you love her, Noodle.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.889
She knows we all do.

37:46.495 --> 37:49.732
Excuse me, Secretary McCord.

37:49.733 --> 37:52.668
President Shiraz.

37:52.669 --> 37:54.604
I'm glad you're okay.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.072
I can say the same of you.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.239
- (laughs)
- Please.

38:00.843 --> 38:04.413
Should I assume since you're
here that the coup has failed?

38:04.414 --> 38:06.282
Yes.

38:06.283 --> 38:09.185
In part because of the information

38:09.186 --> 38:11.854
your government provided.

38:11.855 --> 38:13.623
If you hadn't come,

38:13.624 --> 38:17.592
we might have assumed the
United States backed it.

38:19.896 --> 38:22.965
Minister Javani is dead.

38:22.966 --> 38:25.001
Yes.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.402
A tragic loss.

38:28.604 --> 38:30.640
Zahed was my friend.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.007
And partner.

38:34.310 --> 38:36.312
Mine, too.

38:36.313 --> 38:37.980
I'm sorry.

38:37.981 --> 38:39.914
He respected you.

38:41.617 --> 38:44.453
I'm speaking on behalf of
President Dalton when I say

38:44.454 --> 38:47.823
that I hope that our peace
talks will move forward.

38:47.824 --> 38:51.360
I share this hope.

38:51.361 --> 38:53.396
But now, I fear

38:53.397 --> 38:57.031
there will be too many bodies to bury.

39:01.337 --> 39:04.173
She's alive.

39:04.174 --> 39:05.308
Bess is fine.

39:05.309 --> 39:07.343
- Oh, thank God.
- (sighs)

39:07.344 --> 39:11.147
We should, uh... we
should probably think

39:11.148 --> 39:13.349
about what we're going to put out there.

39:13.350 --> 39:15.351
I don't need to.

39:15.352 --> 39:16.919
Set up a national address.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.422
Well, shouldn't we get
our stories straight first?

39:19.423 --> 39:22.157
No. No cover-up.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.628
Mr. President...

39:25.629 --> 39:28.664
Trust me, Russell. I'd be all
for paving this mess over

39:28.665 --> 39:31.534
if I thought we could,
but you and I both know

39:31.535 --> 39:33.869
there's going to be a feeding frenzy.

39:33.870 --> 39:37.039
We're better off just
getting everything out.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.575
Cover-up's worse than
the crime and such?

39:41.210 --> 39:43.878
Set it up.

39:45.681 --> 39:48.082
(phone buzzes)

39:50.820 --> 39:53.188
Hello.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.192
Yeah. Okay, thank you.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.060
Thank you. (sighs)

39:58.061 --> 39:59.495
Mom's okay. She's coming home.

39:59.496 --> 40:01.196

DALTON: <i>We don't know

41:01.558 --> 41:02.634
<i>but they will surely come out</i>

41:02.635 --> 41:04.544
in the coming days and months.

41:04.545 --> 41:07.379
We do know that certain
high-level officials

41:07.380 --> 41:10.650
in the United States
government were involved.

41:10.651 --> 41:12.194
We also know

41:12.195 --> 41:13.792
that Secretary of State Vincent Marsh's

41:13.793 --> 41:17.491
plane crash was not an accident.

41:17.492 --> 41:20.728
Today, I promise you this:

41:20.729 --> 41:22.563
We will leave no stone unturned.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.732
There will be no secrets.

41:24.733 --> 41:29.168
And the guilty, whoever
they are, will be punished.

41:30.404 --> 41:33.968
In moments like this,
when we experience shock,

41:33.969 --> 41:37.044
<i>when we find our faith challenged,</i>

41:37.045 --> 41:39.780
all Americans must look inward.

41:39.781 --> 41:42.950
<i>The pillars of this nation are strong.</i>

41:42.951 --> 41:45.185
