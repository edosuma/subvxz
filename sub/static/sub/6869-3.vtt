00:03.658 --> 00:13.147
Okay, okay, you got it, you
got it, you... Good morning, floor.

00:14.521 --> 00:17.956
Good morning asshole smoke alarm!

00:18.024 --> 00:19.791
And good morning, medical bills.

00:19.859 --> 00:22.488
Oh, and your friend, crippling debt.

00:29.836 --> 00:33.905
No no no no no no!

00:33.973 --> 00:37.843
Good morning, bittersweet memories.

00:37.910 --> 00:41.413
Good morning, bag of the unspeakable.

00:41.481 --> 00:47.519
And good morning to you, Archer...
The other shitbag in my life!

00:47.535 --> 00:48.887
It's broken?

00:48.902 --> 00:51.070
- Huh?!
- The elevator's broken?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.010
- Huh?!
- The elevator.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.269
- Huh?!
- The elevator!

00:55.300 --> 00:57.772
- Outta order.
- I can see that!

00:57.783 --> 00:59.600
Why the hell did you ask?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:13.799 --> 01:15.354
- You're late.
- I...

01:15.369 --> 01:16.900
Jesus, sweat much?

01:16.916 --> 01:19.046
- The elevator's broken...
- No shit.

01:19.062 --> 01:22.720
...and once again, you parked
that ridiculous car in my space!

01:22.736 --> 01:26.435
- Well, A, the El Camino is not a car...
- Truck, whatever!

01:26.451 --> 01:29.697
- Nor is it a truck, it's a...
- Vehicular hermaphrodite.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.561
Shut up, and B...
wait, what was B?

01:33.593 --> 01:36.789
I dunno, we'll say B was "shut up."
And are we done here?

01:36.816 --> 01:39.168
I need to go not pack some
shoes, since I'm gonna buy

01:39.185 --> 01:41.119
about ten pairs when we get there.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.655
- Get where?
- Roooome!

01:43.663 --> 01:47.632
What?! Not for the Morelli thing!
I planned that entire operation!

01:47.633 --> 01:51.508
- Yes, and you did excellent legwork...
- But now it requires

01:51.531 --> 01:54.700
literal legwork, Ray, like
walking, and maybe running.

01:54.729 --> 01:57.769
Although hopefully not running,
because I'll be in brand-new shoes.

01:57.777 --> 01:59.382
That is so unfair!

01:59.405 --> 02:01.924
Not as unfair
as how laid I'm gonna get.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.744
<i>Ciao, bella, ho scarpe nuove!</i>

02:04.760 --> 02:08.245
- Sorry, honey.
- Yeah, we'll bring you a present.

02:08.246 --> 02:11.950
- Oh, blow me.
- Why? You couldn't feel it!

02:13.395 --> 02:14.965
What.

02:14.981 --> 02:17.374
- Nothing, I'm just curious...
- A bag.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.392
- I piss and shit in a plastic bag.
- Me too!

02:20.405 --> 02:22.950
But actually, I was wondering
if you'd like to walk again.

02:22.965 --> 02:27.312
No, Krieger, because this
way I never have to buy new shoes!

02:27.390 --> 02:29.768
Yeah, but is that worth it?

02:50.889 --> 03:01.766
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:05.657 --> 03:07.090
Robot legs.

03:07.111 --> 03:09.972
No, this has nothing
to do with robotics!

03:09.996 --> 03:13.905
I'm talking about bionics!
From the Greek for... like... kickass!

03:13.928 --> 03:15.707
Is there a
Greek word for "insane"?

03:15.708 --> 03:18.203
Yes! I mean
I assume there is, but...

03:18.216 --> 03:23.711
If you think I'm gonna let you turn
me into some cyborg zombie like Katya...

03:23.737 --> 03:25.437
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, no!

03:25.451 --> 03:29.420
<i>- Zombie</i> implies I raised her from the dead.
- Oh, then I'm using it correctly.

03:29.457 --> 03:33.291
No, you're not. For one thing,
Katya wasn't completely dead.

03:33.311 --> 03:34.911
Just pretty dead?

03:38.455 --> 03:39.927
So pretty...

03:39.955 --> 03:41.341
- Hello?
- Hm?

03:41.366 --> 03:44.639
Oh, so, nothing a few hundred
thousand volts couldn't cure.

03:44.672 --> 03:46.739
The human body's basically
a potato clock.

03:46.761 --> 03:48.829
So, it's gonna
look like I'm leaving?

03:48.833 --> 03:51.698
- But that's only because I'm leaving.
- Why won't you let me help you?!

03:51.718 --> 03:53.946
Besides the fact
you'll probably kill me?!

03:53.980 --> 03:56.517
- Yes!
- Because it's wrong!

03:56.541 --> 03:59.041
And I may have wandered pretty
far from the Church,

03:59.058 --> 04:02.225
but I do still believe there are some
things that only God should do!

04:02.252 --> 04:04.053
Like give you an erection?!

04:04.081 --> 04:08.818
I'm assuming you mean "give
me the ability to have an erection"?

04:08.847 --> 04:10.382
Also, yes.

04:10.407 --> 04:12.253
- No!
- Yes, Lana!

04:12.281 --> 04:16.238
- We don't need a...
- Rocket launcher, <i>si, molto pronto!</i>

04:16.253 --> 04:20.165
Mmmmneew, not on the pre-approved
list of equipment for this mission.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.418
- The what?
- The...

04:21.420 --> 04:23.092
- I heard you!
- Why'd you ask?

04:23.093 --> 04:25.860
Pre-approved by whom?!
- Oh, now you're on my side.

04:25.861 --> 04:27.609
- Shut up.
- Common enemy.

04:27.610 --> 04:30.651
- That's how Lana and I started dating.
- Shut up.

04:30.658 --> 04:32.806
Pre-approved, by whom.

04:32.827 --> 04:35.609
- Ms. Archer.
Wh-? She doesn't know what we need!

04:35.610 --> 04:38.331
The last time she was in the field,
they were still using muskets!

04:38.332 --> 04:39.894
- Really?
- Seriously?

04:39.915 --> 04:41.115
No?

04:41.116 --> 04:44.653
Look dipshit, my mother obviously
doesn't know about this stuff, so...

04:44.654 --> 04:48.239
So she goes by my personal,
professional recommendations.

04:48.256 --> 04:50.757
I'm gonna need you to repeat that.

04:50.788 --> 04:54.471
- I said...
- No no, shh, after I come back there

04:54.472 --> 04:57.087
and pull your tongue
out through your...

04:57.113 --> 04:58.546
- Asshole!
- Ew.

04:58.553 --> 05:01.531
You'd need a bulldozer
made of acid to get in here.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.785
Ooh, or Spacebot!

05:02.806 --> 05:05.075
And if you continue
to behave threateningly...

05:05.101 --> 05:06.859
You haven't
seen threateningly.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.942
You'll need one
to get out of there.

05:11.246 --> 05:12.713
Remember Spacebot?

05:12.714 --> 05:13.916
Guys?

05:13.927 --> 05:16.569
And so, a small power
unit goes here, on your uh,

05:16.584 --> 05:20.897
spiny thing, which sends electrical
impulses to your muscles and ligaments and

05:20.913 --> 05:24.406
stuff, which I will fuse to a
vanadium alloy endoskeleton,

05:24.426 --> 05:27.619
replacing your current, um, legbones.

05:27.629 --> 05:31.557
I have to say it kind of worries me you
don't know the names of the actual bones.

05:31.558 --> 05:33.990
Who cares?
Zrrp, they're in the dumpster.

05:34.002 --> 05:38.881
Ew. Wait, then all I need is the
power unit, not a bunch of vanadium bones!

05:38.882 --> 05:40.282
Yeah, but they're awesome.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.218
But if you don't put everything
back where it's supposed to go...

05:43.241 --> 05:45.177
I've already done it twice!

05:47.221 --> 05:49.356
There you go, Conway.

05:49.393 --> 05:53.420
Plus when I'm taking out the old bones
I take tons of pictures with my phone.

05:53.444 --> 05:55.825
Oh, well then
what could go wrong?

05:55.857 --> 05:57.937
- Seriously?
- Sarcastically.

05:57.971 --> 06:00.645
Oh.
Because you could die.

06:00.679 --> 06:04.853
I realize that. And I'll, ya
know, sign a release form or whatever...

06:04.869 --> 06:06.459
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Really?

06:06.481 --> 06:09.824
No, I mean if, God
forbid, the worst happens...

06:09.853 --> 06:12.195
- There's lots of dumpsters.
- Jesus.

06:12.221 --> 06:15.768
- Sure, if he helps.
- Whew, okay, so when do we do this?

06:15.783 --> 06:18.685
Well, you should already be
feeling the effects of the anesthetic...

06:18.717 --> 06:21.615
The...
God damn it, Krieger!

06:21.630 --> 06:25.124
- So whenever my assistants get here.
- What's up, spaghetti-legs?

06:25.125 --> 06:27.134
- Wait a minute!
- Yeah, where's Carol?

06:27.150 --> 06:29.749
Gettin' that list
of shit you wanted.

06:30.868 --> 06:33.854
- Thank you!
- Seriously! What am I, hourly?!

06:33.855 --> 06:35.599
- Are you not?
- I don't know!

06:35.624 --> 06:38.638
Move. Oh, and when
I'm through talking to Malory?

06:38.639 --> 06:41.389
I wouldn't be surprised if you
find yourself out of a job.

06:41.398 --> 06:42.765
- I would.
- Burn.

06:42.795 --> 06:45.106
- Cyril?!
- Is it Halloween already?

06:45.124 --> 06:46.124
I don't know!

06:46.127 --> 06:47.493
Then why are
you dressed like that?

06:47.515 --> 06:50.985
Because, duh, I'm helping
Krieger turn Ray into a stupid cyborg.

06:51.005 --> 06:51.931
A what?!

06:51.953 --> 06:53.821
But I guess
some cyborgs are smart...

06:53.850 --> 06:55.483
What are you talking about?!

06:55.519 --> 06:58.801
Well, you gotta be pretty smart
to fool the ol' Voight-Kampff machine.

06:58.829 --> 07:02.234
- In Krieger's lab?!
- Anywhere, duh, it's portable.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.588
No no no no no!

07:04.632 --> 07:06.067
Uh, yes it is.

07:06.089 --> 07:07.582
Yo, Magnum P.U.

07:07.602 --> 07:11.252
I need a lead-acid battery, fifty
units of plasma, some bolt cutters,

07:11.272 --> 07:15.710
and something called a...
<i>Defrimbulator?</i>

07:15.722 --> 07:17.222
That's a made-up word.

07:17.235 --> 07:18.686
They're all made up.

07:21.376 --> 07:24.032
Mind! Blown!

07:24.194 --> 07:27.970
Yeah, what
could go wrong...

07:28.048 --> 07:31.336
Ray's gonna be a cyborg
over my dead body!

07:31.380 --> 07:33.112
Or preferably his!

07:33.127 --> 07:34.983
But somebody's!

07:35.210 --> 07:41.076
What could
possibly, go, wrrngzzzzzz.

07:41.607 --> 07:44.053
Hey, should I wash my hands?

07:44.071 --> 07:45.338
I didn't.

07:55.544 --> 07:58.279
Krieger! Krieger!

07:58.347 --> 08:00.951
Krieger open this goddamn door!

08:00.995 --> 08:03.255
Krieger I am gonna count to one!

08:03.287 --> 08:06.391
Oh that's right, he hates robots!

08:06.455 --> 08:09.061
For the... this! Is a robot!

08:09.086 --> 08:10.975
Gillette is a human being!

08:11.014 --> 08:14.169
But he won't be for long if
you don't clamp that artery!

08:14.206 --> 08:15.740
One!

08:18.133 --> 08:19.567
Brett?

08:19.635 --> 08:21.469
What in the hell...?

08:21.591 --> 08:22.953
Were those gunshots?!

08:22.961 --> 08:26.127
Oh, who knows with these people,
it's one calamity after another.

08:26.151 --> 08:32.028
That's, yes, exactly, that's why
you need a nice long relaxing cruise!

08:32.059 --> 08:37.418
But I really really really
really really don't think I'll enjoy it.

08:37.486 --> 08:39.419
Sure you will.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.092
- Brett?!
- Archer!

08:45.128 --> 08:46.496
What the shit are you doing?!

08:46.520 --> 08:49.297
Um, investigating
a ballistic anomaly.

08:49.348 --> 08:50.725
C'mon, walk and talk.

08:50.756 --> 08:54.262
I don't even think he's on this floor, but
idiot Brett still managed to get shot.

08:54.294 --> 08:56.271
Yeah, he's the idiot.

08:56.305 --> 08:58.318
- Right?
- You idiot!

08:58.340 --> 09:01.508
If I hadn't checked the time at that
exact second I'd be dead right now!

09:01.531 --> 09:05.180
Which reminds me, Grover Cleveland
called, he wants his watch back.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.340
Archer... He left
two non-consecutive messages.

09:08.377 --> 09:10.645
This was my
grandfather's, you ass!

09:10.683 --> 09:12.149
I'll buy you another one!

09:12.154 --> 09:14.155
Now how were you holding
it, like, exactly!

09:14.168 --> 09:19.658
- I... I dunno, like this I guess...
- Okay, sooooo... Boom.

09:19.669 --> 09:23.372
C'mon, this is awesome, it's like
we're the Warren Commission.

09:23.468 --> 09:25.135
Look look look, check it out!

09:25.163 --> 09:26.741
It's a real magic bullet!

09:26.772 --> 09:29.453
Why the hell were you shooting
at Krieger's door in the first place?

09:29.470 --> 09:31.003
Oh shit, right!

09:31.009 --> 09:33.306
Brett, this might be some kind of record!

09:33.311 --> 09:36.179
So if you can move, don't!

09:36.207 --> 09:37.539
I gotta go stop him!

09:37.570 --> 09:38.783
Stop who?!

09:38.810 --> 09:40.277
"Whom!"
Archer!

09:40.278 --> 09:43.552
Krieger!
He's making a gay terminator!

09:43.860 --> 09:45.850
Aaaaand yep.

09:45.891 --> 09:47.591
Officially confused.

09:47.615 --> 09:50.637
Yeah, did he mean
a terminator of gays?

09:50.662 --> 09:53.668
Because Krieger's creepy and
weird, but he's not homophobic,

09:53.698 --> 09:58.702
I don't think, so he must've meant...
well, no, aren't terminators asexual?

09:58.739 --> 10:01.417
- Not when I'm done with him...
- C'mon, how's that even

10:01.440 --> 10:05.342
supposed to... fit inside
another human being?

10:05.371 --> 10:08.679
Oh. That shouldn't
be doing that. There we go.

10:08.698 --> 10:11.596
No no no, do it again,
do it again, do it a...

10:11.634 --> 10:13.805
This man is barely
clinging to life, woman!

10:13.819 --> 10:15.587
- Get a hold of yourself!
- Sorry.

10:15.603 --> 10:18.107
And then get a hold
of your goddamn beer can!

10:18.135 --> 10:22.638
Sorry. Jeez... Ehh...

10:22.864 --> 10:27.665
- Blood pressure?
- I'll be honest, it's not great.

10:27.697 --> 10:31.368
- Wh-? I'm talking about his!
- - Me too.

10:31.436 --> 10:32.719
Since when?

10:32.737 --> 10:36.912
Since the... the new intelligence,
Mother, from Ray, about the mission!

10:36.942 --> 10:38.702
That says you
need a rocket launcher?

10:38.743 --> 10:39.977
Yes!

10:39.978 --> 10:41.187
- Can I...
- No.

10:41.188 --> 10:43.993
...just sort of interject
here, Malory, this is exactly

10:44.017 --> 10:46.930
- what I'm talking about, with the stress...
- Ron?

10:46.950 --> 10:49.021
Seriously, Ron,
why aren't you at work?

10:49.052 --> 10:52.819
Because I spent thirty years building
the business so I don't have to be!

10:52.853 --> 10:54.887
Because I hired good managers!

10:54.915 --> 10:58.084
- Walk into any one of my six dealerships...
- Not six...

10:58.099 --> 11:02.294
Next year it'll be seven, sport,
we just broke ground in White Plains.

11:02.323 --> 11:04.757
- That's actually fairly impressive.
- You have no idea.

11:04.782 --> 11:06.042
With that city council?

11:06.065 --> 11:09.656
Ron this isn't a car dealership,
The same principle!

11:09.687 --> 11:12.686
You build it, hire people
you trust to manage it.

11:12.696 --> 11:14.417
- Ha!
- Yeah, ha.

11:14.418 --> 11:16.352
...and then you collect
the fruits of their labor!

11:16.376 --> 11:19.764
Because don't, please, don't
take this the wrong way, babe -

11:19.780 --> 11:22.833
but you're not getting any younger.

11:25.038 --> 11:28.186
- You said a rocket launcher?
- I did.

11:28.214 --> 11:30.122
I did say a rocket launcher.

11:30.154 --> 11:32.324
- Then give this to <i>whosits</i>.
- I will.

11:32.345 --> 11:34.028
I will give this to <i>whosits</i>.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.781
And call me if you ever wanna
test drive the new Coupe de Ville.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.966
- Well, I just got a new El Camino...
- Oh, so you're all set.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.335
That'll hold way more
Hispanics and lawnmowers.

11:46.031 --> 11:47.440
- Wow.
- I know!

11:47.464 --> 11:50.713
That's why I can never stay mad at him!

11:51.545 --> 11:52.745
Right?

11:52.779 --> 11:54.212
Wait, why were you mad?

11:54.233 --> 11:58.303
Because I think Krieger's doing some
kinda... bionic shit to Ray's legs!

11:58.326 --> 12:01.219
- And Archer, obviously...
- Would rather see Ray dead!

12:01.248 --> 12:06.647
Jeezy P, I mean, besides Barry and
Katya, what is his deal with robots?

12:07.088 --> 12:10.162
- Servant, call an ambulance.
- Yessir, right away sir!

12:10.229 --> 12:13.065
- An ambulance?!
- He needs emergency surgery.

12:13.082 --> 12:15.738
And even then, it'll be a miracle
if we can save his testicles.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.824
But... what could
have caused this?!

12:20.133 --> 12:21.907
- Mumps?
- Or who knows.

12:21.944 --> 12:24.345
The important thing is,
what are you doing tonight?

12:24.373 --> 12:26.173
I... oh!

12:26.187 --> 12:29.023
Well, I said I might meet some
people at this thing downtown,

12:29.048 --> 12:32.624
but it sounded like it'll be pretty
heavy on Negroes and jazz, so...

12:32.652 --> 12:34.667
I happen to
love Negroes and jazz.

12:34.698 --> 12:37.160
Oh! Well then
I'll just get my coat.

12:37.183 --> 12:38.441
And I'll wait here.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.960
For the ambulance to take your
grievously wounded child to the

12:41.027 --> 12:43.395
hospital for emergency surgery?

12:43.463 --> 12:47.908
Yes, Woodhouse, and then you
can go buy some wax for your cross.

12:47.939 --> 12:49.273
Krieger?

12:49.317 --> 12:51.574
Oh my God... I'm
a little busy right now!

12:51.605 --> 12:55.172
Yeah I know, are you cyborging Ray?

12:55.188 --> 12:56.305
No?

12:56.321 --> 12:59.044
Look, I think it's great
Then yes!

12:59.065 --> 13:01.479
But I think Archer's
gonna try to stop you!

13:01.515 --> 13:03.246
He's kinda freaking out!

13:03.279 --> 13:05.943
Let him! That door
came off the Graf Spee!

13:05.944 --> 13:07.312
To get in here he'd need...

13:07.313 --> 13:10.478
One RPG-7 launcher
and two grenades.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.814
As per the note from your mother.

13:12.841 --> 13:15.310
Thank you, uh, sorry,
what was your name again?

13:15.346 --> 13:18.597
- Rodney.
- Thank you, asshole.

13:21.537 --> 13:24.973
What in the...? Why aren't you
people on the way to the airport?

13:25.041 --> 13:28.510
We may have sort
of a, uh, situation.

13:28.537 --> 13:30.373
And what sort would that be?!

13:30.379 --> 13:32.447
- This is what I'm talking about...
- Ron!

13:32.462 --> 13:35.155
If you keep it up, this headache
you gave me is going to last for

13:35.184 --> 13:37.154
the next three to five nights.

13:37.170 --> 13:38.961
Look, don't worry, I can handle it.

13:38.974 --> 13:41.790
- But...
- Let her handle it! She seems capable.

13:41.819 --> 13:43.086
Hey, thanks.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.913
Reminds me of the head mechanic
at my dealership in Yonkers.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.629
- He's a black.
- Wow.

13:47.657 --> 13:49.568
I know, and head mechanic!

13:49.598 --> 13:52.668
Now c'mon, babe, let these people do
whatever it is you pay them to do,

13:52.735 --> 13:54.502
and let's go start our weekend.

13:54.570 --> 13:57.127
Alright, but
don't miss that flight.

13:57.174 --> 14:00.508
God knows how long it takes to
check in with a rocket launcher.

14:00.559 --> 14:02.535
Oh, shit!

14:02.635 --> 14:05.776
Well calling the
airport's not gonna help.

14:06.491 --> 14:10.761
Oh, and one last thing, Rodney,
when I get back from Rome, you're...

14:10.790 --> 14:13.689
Hang on oooooone second.
Armory.

14:13.690 --> 14:16.598
- Hey will you bring...
- No.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.360
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ooookay.

14:19.381 --> 14:21.562
- You were saying?
- I... shit.

14:21.597 --> 14:24.866
Something about an asskicking
with handmade Italian shoes?

14:24.894 --> 14:28.465
Well, think about it,
you've got time.

14:28.738 --> 14:31.586
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing?!

14:31.607 --> 14:36.344
Obtaining armory materiel under false
pretenses is a fireable offense!

14:36.412 --> 14:40.749
Oh my... I basically just lurch
from one fireable offense to the next!

14:40.785 --> 14:43.280
Ugh, like the
infamous "Luau Incident."

14:43.319 --> 14:46.627
Jesus Christ, how many times
do I have to apologize for that?!

14:46.655 --> 14:48.790
Once would be nice!

14:48.858 --> 14:51.061
No.
Rodney, open this door.

14:51.085 --> 14:53.921
- Give me that weapon.
- Oh. You mean this rocket launcher?

14:53.930 --> 14:56.664
Because I bet it would open the door.

14:56.694 --> 14:58.527
No, that is
inadvisable at this time.

14:58.556 --> 15:01.514
- Ya know, if I asked it nicely.
- I seriously wouldn't do that.

15:01.543 --> 15:03.958
Yeah, because you're not awesome.

15:05.339 --> 15:09.443
- Oh, and what fresh hell is this?!
- Whatever it is, they can handle it!

15:09.489 --> 15:11.715
They can't even
handle a simple luau!

15:11.751 --> 15:14.894
- My God, what they did to that pig...
- Heeelp...

15:14.941 --> 15:17.722
- Brett?!
- Nghhh...

15:17.732 --> 15:21.383
Great, now I get to slog my
new Delmans through a lake of blood.

15:21.407 --> 15:25.627
I want that all cleaned up before
Monday, mister! Do you hear me?!

15:25.647 --> 15:29.480
No... Because
that room is blast-proof!

15:29.500 --> 15:31.078
Mawp.

15:31.237 --> 15:33.003
Maaaawp.

15:34.216 --> 15:35.720
Mawp.

15:36.639 --> 15:38.874
What the shit was that?!

15:38.903 --> 15:42.338
Hopefully the last remaining
shred of Archer's eardrums.

15:42.366 --> 15:45.334
That crazy son of a... come on!

15:45.355 --> 15:48.591
Why is your instinctive
response to run toward explosions?!

15:48.621 --> 15:51.689
Mmm... because
I'm not a giant pussy?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.479
Although, somehow,
incredibly single.

15:53.489 --> 15:56.469
Wh-?! I go on...
tons of dates!

15:56.492 --> 15:58.426
- With who?!
- Men!

15:58.494 --> 16:00.095
Men models!

16:00.162 --> 16:01.930
Men who model!

16:03.666 --> 16:06.307
...permanent damage
to my earballs because you're too

16:06.368 --> 16:11.306
chickenshit to take your candy-ass to
the future and smash the defense grid

16:11.373 --> 16:14.109
- so Skynet...
- Whoa whoa whoa!

16:14.121 --> 16:16.912
Not cool, man!
That is not at all cool!

16:16.980 --> 16:20.448
Rodney you
mind your own dicky beeswax!

16:20.516 --> 16:22.550
- You got another one in ya?
- Ew.

16:22.619 --> 16:24.385
- I don't...
- Tease.

16:24.453 --> 16:27.194
- ... and I'm sorry for that one...
- Don't be.

16:27.225 --> 16:29.483
...because I'm just
gonna say it, I think it's

16:29.525 --> 16:33.344
suuuper creepy you get sexually
aroused by physical violence.

16:33.367 --> 16:37.465
Well but
also emotional violence.

16:37.533 --> 16:39.001
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:39.068 --> 16:42.904
That's even creepier.
So are you gonna open the damn door?

16:42.972 --> 16:44.506
As soon as you
give me that weapon.

16:44.573 --> 16:48.416
Wh-? Do you honestly wanna
live through the rise of the machines?!

16:48.486 --> 16:51.988
Which you won't, because no one will?!

16:52.055 --> 16:54.138
- I...
- It was rhetorical!

16:56.560 --> 17:02.665
So now if you'll excuse me... I
have an entire human race to save.

17:02.733 --> 17:04.934
What is he...
Hey, that's ISIS property!

17:05.002 --> 17:07.536
- What this?
- Yes.

17:07.585 --> 17:10.172
- Take me with you!
- Shut up!

17:10.240 --> 17:14.561
Ooh, yeah, even that little
bit's enough to get the engine revved up.

17:14.587 --> 17:19.031
So Rodneeeeeey... Tease!

17:19.983 --> 17:21.612
Jeezy Petes...

17:21.627 --> 17:24.153
Cyril what're you doing
right now?

17:24.175 --> 17:27.097
- I...
- Helping me find Archer, where is he?!

17:28.770 --> 17:30.496
Super.

17:30.528 --> 17:34.136
- Are you calling the airport again?
- Cyril shut your goddamn mouth!

17:37.030 --> 17:40.770
Hey, guess what's not
a good time? Wait, where?!

17:40.795 --> 17:44.749
- Gotta be somewhere in there...
- Not you! And did you count right?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.510
- What, to five? Dicknuts?
- Krieger!

17:47.541 --> 17:49.618
Look, you gotta
keep him away from the lab!

17:49.634 --> 17:53.349
We're almost done, if somebody
can find their last beer!

17:53.367 --> 17:56.268
I can
promise it ain't my last.

17:56.286 --> 17:58.818
I mean, I doubt
he can find it...

17:58.833 --> 18:02.004
God damn it.
I told 'em, I said...

18:02.043 --> 18:05.294
Maps!
All through the HVAC ducts!

18:05.362 --> 18:08.264
Or just at the, whatever, junctions.

18:08.278 --> 18:12.969
I won't even waste however much
dryerase it'll take to write that down.

18:12.986 --> 18:18.109
No, Mother, because you were too
busy wasting it on "Fourth of Ju-Luau!"

18:18.809 --> 18:22.645
But still, see if you can flush
him out. I'd hate to use the nerve gas.

18:22.713 --> 18:25.047
Do not!
Use the nerve gas!

18:25.081 --> 18:28.886
- And yet incredibly single...
- How the hell do we flush him out?

18:28.917 --> 18:31.320
- Uh, duh...
- Huh?!

18:31.341 --> 18:34.442
I said, how hot can you make it?

18:35.759 --> 18:41.130
No no no... It's
already happening...

18:41.482 --> 18:43.825
Holy shit, already?

18:43.868 --> 18:46.335
Yeah, I actually
feel pretty good.

18:46.403 --> 18:49.572
- How is that possible?
- It's a proprietary blend.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.281
And barring some sort
of massive infection...

18:52.312 --> 18:54.811
Don't look at me,
found number six!

18:54.839 --> 18:56.403
You should be
up and around by Monday.

18:56.413 --> 19:00.295
Well then can I go home?
Cause it's hot as balls up in here.

19:00.318 --> 19:03.486
The thermostat's
becoming sentient!

19:03.554 --> 19:07.722
Oh God! That's how
<i>Maximum Overdrive</i> started!

19:19.436 --> 19:21.532
Well I'd be lying
if I said I cared...

19:21.558 --> 19:23.907
Wh-? Malory,
Ray can walk again!

19:23.940 --> 19:26.375
Buh-duh-buh-baaaaa!
- You mean "mince?"

19:26.387 --> 19:28.006
- Ya know...
- Maybe he can mince

19:28.021 --> 19:31.382
to the bank and apply for a twelve
thousand dollar loan for a new furnace!

19:31.416 --> 19:34.468
Why did you idiots leave it
on ninety all weekend?!

19:37.484 --> 19:39.804
Your clothes.
Give them to me.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.307
Aaagh!

19:41.369 --> 19:45.773
I'm kidding, obviously, I wouldn't
be caught dead in a sweater vest.

19:45.796 --> 19:47.943
Now, if you'll excuse me...

19:48.669 --> 19:51.021
Just like
Fourth of Ju-Luau...

19:51.046 --> 19:54.215
Yeah, if you
slid a pig under him.
