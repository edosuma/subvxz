00:13.763 --> 00:14.597
Hector DeJean?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.516
You are under arrest.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.114
-It's me...
-What's your next move?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.980
Your father is very busy now.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.316
He asked me to check on you.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.160
Excuse me.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.621
Roman Platov asked me to drop by.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.539
Where can I find him?

26:15.365 --> 26:17.033
<i>Jan, it's me.</i>

26:18.285 --> 26:19.619
<i>We've had some trouble.</i>

26:19.869 --> 26:22.038
<i>I'm not sure I can come back just yet...</i>

44:43.681 --> 44:45.641
-One of Jadovsky's?
-Yes.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.354
I want Timur's fucking head,

44:51.188 --> 44:54.233
save the rest for my meat grinder.

47:15.707 --> 47:17.584
Kolya, this is a different number.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.295
Have you called me from an open line?

47:20.796 --> 47:21.797
<i>No, Vassily.</i>

47:22.339 --> 47:28.262
An encrypted line.
You're still the mistress.

47:29.221 --> 47:33.642
We cannot be seen cavorting together...

47:33.809 --> 47:40.691
and you should know, Basarov snatched in
broad daylight is worrisome for us.

47:40.941 --> 47:41.984
The troop transports...

47:42.192 --> 47:43.485
is the Kremlin turning them back?

47:43.777 --> 47:45.904
Like Doc Holiday in <i>Tombstone...</i> we call.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.864
If the 14-Eyes...

47:48.824 --> 47:52.411
persuade NATO to ride to the rescue,

47:54.705 --> 47:59.459
you'll have to absorb this. If not,

48:00.377 --> 48:03.297
Estonia will be separated from the herd...

48:03.880 --> 48:06.508
-And you will join...
<i>-Yes.</i>

48:07.509 --> 48:11.263
We've been offered a trade,
Basarov for their man.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.186
...is a tiresome guest.

48:19.271 --> 48:20.606
No fun.

48:22.524 --> 48:24.860
I accept.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.613
<i>You have until...</i>

48:27.988 --> 48:32.326
midnight tomorrow.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.330
We'll send him off with a memorable
farewell.

49:32.719 --> 49:33.970
He's waiting for you.

49:55.534 --> 49:59.830
Whose decision was it to take
Daniel Miller alive?

50:00.706 --> 50:02.749
Yours, Rodion, I believe.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.627
I was following orders.

50:06.211 --> 50:07.587
His.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.009
Yes.

50:17.055 --> 50:18.598
A risky move,

50:19.349 --> 50:20.517
surprising me,

50:21.393 --> 50:24.771
showing me willful initiative...

50:25.188 --> 50:27.774
bordering on insolence...

50:39.578 --> 50:43.290
is proving every bit as valuable...
