WEBVTT

00:04.281 --> 00:06.349
This is, like,
the tenth meal out this week.

00:06.351 --> 00:07.817
Hey.

00:07.819 --> 00:09.653
Tomorrow, we cook.

00:09.655 --> 00:10.787
You say that every night.

00:10.789 --> 00:13.056
I'm sorry, sir.
Your card's been declined.

00:13.058 --> 00:15.525
That's got to be a mistake.

00:15.527 --> 00:16.493
I...

00:16.495 --> 00:17.594
They must have, changed

00:17.596 --> 00:19.095
the due date.

00:19.097 --> 00:20.730
Keep the change.

00:21.565 --> 00:23.800
Are we broke?

00:23.802 --> 00:25.368
No, we're not broke.

00:25.370 --> 00:26.536
And do you mind

00:26.538 --> 00:29.472
not announcing it to the
whole restaurant, please?

00:29.474 --> 00:30.840
Just not used to managing

00:30.842 --> 00:32.142
the bills

00:32.144 --> 00:33.777
and working and all that stuff.

00:33.779 --> 00:35.078
That used to be Mom's job?

00:35.080 --> 00:36.346
Yes. And now it's my job,

00:36.348 --> 00:37.647
and I have it under control.

00:37.649 --> 00:38.682
You know you can

00:38.684 --> 00:40.116
set that stuff up
automatically now?

00:40.118 --> 00:41.284
Like, online.

00:41.286 --> 00:42.419
Like most young people do.

00:42.421 --> 00:44.254
Yes, I know.

00:44.256 --> 00:46.389
Let's go.

00:46.391 --> 00:49.759
You gonna be able to pay
for my college, Dad?

00:49.761 --> 00:51.528
You can go
to any college you want to.

00:51.530 --> 00:52.495
As long as your brother and I

00:52.497 --> 00:54.130
- can come for a sleepover.
- Yep.

00:54.132 --> 00:55.665
No way, you guys. Not happening.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.967
Don't worry about money.
Come on.

01:00.771 --> 01:01.971
Here's the coffee machine.

01:01.973 --> 01:03.873
Okay.
Make sure this red light is off.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.542
- Mr. Jones will notice.
- Sure.

01:06.978 --> 01:08.478
And turn off your phone. Sorry.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.679
I thought it was on silent.

01:09.681 --> 01:10.847
Good morning, everybody.

01:10.849 --> 01:12.716
Hey, Mr. Jones.
Good morning, Mr. Jones.

01:12.718 --> 01:14.150
You must be the new intern.

01:14.152 --> 01:15.652
Miss Boyle.

01:15.654 --> 01:17.987
Hi, Mr. Jones. Yes, I'm Nicky.

01:17.989 --> 01:19.856
Come on,
let's chat for a minute.

01:21.659 --> 01:24.761
I hope Grace showed you
the time of your life

01:24.763 --> 01:26.463
on the tour
of the coffee machine.

01:26.465 --> 01:28.331
She did, Mr. Jones. Thank you.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.667
Free coffee all day long.

01:30.669 --> 01:33.269
Doughnuts, too.
Cake on birthdays.

01:33.271 --> 01:35.839
We're basically the
Google offices...

01:35.841 --> 01:38.208
Minus the pingpong tables,

01:38.210 --> 01:40.944
stock options, big salaries.

01:40.946 --> 01:42.378
Really hope you didn't come here
to get rich.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.882
Nope, just a really big fan
of what you do.

01:45.884 --> 01:47.317
And now starting your own

01:47.319 --> 01:49.819
refugee organization, it's...

01:49.821 --> 01:52.021
really inspiring, Mr. Jones.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.090
"It's really inspiring, Bobby."

01:54.092 --> 01:55.592
So...

01:55.594 --> 01:57.427
what inspires you?

01:57.429 --> 01:58.762
What are your interests?

01:58.764 --> 02:01.097
I like to read.

02:01.099 --> 02:02.699
Go to art museums.

02:02.701 --> 02:04.234
Do you really like
to go to art museums,

02:04.236 --> 02:06.369
or do you just think
it makes you sound cultured?

02:06.371 --> 02:08.604
6040?

02:08.607 --> 02:10.173
Honest answer. I like it.

02:10.175 --> 02:11.908
- Thank you.
- And I can see

02:11.910 --> 02:13.309
you have a nice sense of style.

02:13.311 --> 02:15.512
That shirt is...

02:15.514 --> 02:16.913
Stella McCartney?

02:16.915 --> 02:19.015
I wish.

02:19.017 --> 02:20.750
Well, you wear it well,
Nicky Boyle.

02:22.087 --> 02:24.754
Now go get some work done.

02:24.756 --> 02:27.423
Thank you.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.931
Sir!

02:34.933 --> 02:36.032
Sir, excuse me?

02:36.034 --> 02:38.434
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

02:38.436 --> 02:40.270
Stop for a sec, please.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.473
Identification, please.

02:43.475 --> 02:45.141
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.442
Saw you jaywalking over there.

02:46.444 --> 02:48.077
You're charging me
for jaywalking?

02:48.079 --> 02:49.279
I'm not charging you
with anything.

02:49.281 --> 02:50.513
Then I don't owe you anything.

02:50.515 --> 02:51.948
Excuse me, sir?

02:51.950 --> 02:53.483
Hey, stop! Now.

02:53.485 --> 02:56.352
Stop!

02:56.354 --> 02:58.755
Sir, what are you doing
in this neighborhood?

02:58.757 --> 03:01.324
I don't owe you an explanation.

03:03.828 --> 03:06.496
Sir, please take your hands
out of your pockets.

03:08.165 --> 03:10.466
Take your hands
out of your pockets now.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.504
Do you not have
identification, sir?

03:14.506 --> 03:15.738
He didn't do anything wrong.

03:15.740 --> 03:16.940
Take a step back.
The man has rights,

03:16.942 --> 03:18.374
officer.
Take a step back, everybody.

03:18.376 --> 03:19.776
Take a step back, sir.

03:19.778 --> 03:21.077
I'm just asking for this man's
ID, all right, folks?

03:21.079 --> 03:22.178
Thank you.

03:22.180 --> 03:24.747
Are you refusing
to show identification, sir?

03:24.749 --> 03:26.749
Do you not have identification?

03:26.751 --> 03:27.750
What do you think you're doing?

03:27.752 --> 03:29.285
Sir, are you
an illegal immigrant?

03:29.287 --> 03:31.721
- That's racial profiling.
- Whoa.

03:31.723 --> 03:32.922
Take a step back.

03:32.924 --> 03:34.824
Take a step back.

03:34.826 --> 03:36.025
Sir, I need you
to back all the way up.

03:36.027 --> 03:36.860
All right, you can't...

03:36.862 --> 03:37.961
That's harassment.

03:37.963 --> 03:39.295
All right, ma'am, back up.

03:39.297 --> 03:41.497
- Back up, everybody. Back up!
- Get her badge number.

03:41.499 --> 03:43.466
You need to... Sir, I need you
to back up now.

03:43.468 --> 03:46.603
Sir, I need you
to take a step back right now.

03:46.605 --> 03:48.371
I hear you, but please

03:48.373 --> 03:51.374
take a step back and listen.

03:54.879 --> 03:57.780
So, convince me.

03:57.782 --> 04:00.116
That little gem
set us back a couple years.

04:00.118 --> 04:01.217
- In what way?
- In terms

04:01.219 --> 04:02.418
of our socalled
"community policing."

04:02.420 --> 04:03.519
Not "socalled."

04:03.521 --> 04:04.921
It is when that's
the how to video.

04:04.923 --> 04:06.356
All I see is a cop

04:06.358 --> 04:07.523
doing her job.

04:07.525 --> 04:08.791
All you see is what
you want to see, then.

04:08.793 --> 04:09.859
The officer stopped

04:09.861 --> 04:11.194
and questioned the guy,

04:11.196 --> 04:12.929
and the guy refused
to give his ID.

04:12.931 --> 04:14.530
They're both within
their rights.

04:14.532 --> 04:16.031
- Exactly.
- Back in the day,

04:16.034 --> 04:17.901
- yes. Today, no.
- How?

04:17.903 --> 04:18.834
The governor's

04:18.837 --> 04:21.170
executive order
specifically bars

04:21.172 --> 04:24.474
state agencies from asking
a person's immigration status.

04:24.476 --> 04:26.075
Except in certain situations,

04:26.077 --> 04:27.810
such as a law enforcement
investigation.

04:27.812 --> 04:29.512
We all read the order.

04:29.514 --> 04:31.581
That isn't exactly
a law enforcement investigation.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.582
Well, some clips show

04:32.584 --> 04:35.084
Rivera jaywalking.
Which isn't a crime.

04:35.086 --> 04:36.386
But is illegal.

04:36.388 --> 04:38.054
What it says is jaywalking

04:38.056 --> 04:40.456
is a crime that gets you
thrown out of the country

04:40.458 --> 04:43.359
if you look
like Mr. Rivera there.

04:44.194 --> 04:46.529
Why all the hype, Garrett?

04:46.531 --> 04:47.730
It's not hype.

04:47.732 --> 04:49.165
When these videos went viral,

04:49.167 --> 04:50.600
Immigration and Customs

04:50.602 --> 04:52.435
tracked him down.

04:52.437 --> 04:53.836
He's here illegally.

04:53.838 --> 04:55.405
Then all's well that ends well.

04:55.407 --> 04:57.206
Sometimes I just want
to clock you, you know that?

04:57.208 --> 04:59.609
What?
The guy's got a clean record,

04:59.611 --> 05:01.644
a steady job, a wife,

05:01.646 --> 05:03.379
two kids and a newborn.

05:03.381 --> 05:07.083
And thanks to our eager and
industrious young officer,

05:07.085 --> 05:08.418
he's now awaiting trial

05:08.420 --> 05:11.321
for deportation
back to Venezuela.

05:11.323 --> 05:14.524
Look at it that way,
guess it gets a little muddy.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.092
Out there, in this community?

05:16.094 --> 05:17.260
It's not muddy at all.

05:17.262 --> 05:19.162
It's gin clear.

05:19.164 --> 05:21.731
Our community policing
is a scam.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.936
You need to tread lightly there.

05:29.374 --> 05:32.442
I flog our progress
relentlessly and proudly

05:32.444 --> 05:35.611
eight days a week,
but not for this.

05:39.683 --> 05:41.384
We need to own up to it,

05:41.386 --> 05:43.453
loud and clear,

05:43.455 --> 05:46.456
if you want to gain back
the lost ground.

05:53.531 --> 05:56.032
- What do we got?
- Detectives.

05:56.034 --> 05:57.633
Victim is Bruce Daniels.

05:57.635 --> 05:59.669
50s. Owner of the apartment.

05:59.671 --> 06:02.005
He was discovered this morning
by his neighbors.

06:02.007 --> 06:03.773
Any sign of forced entry?

06:03.775 --> 06:05.174
Nah, not so far.

06:05.176 --> 06:07.176
For sure, no obvious ones.

06:07.178 --> 06:09.245
Where is he? Right this way.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:23.293 --> 06:24.527
Who else was here?

06:24.529 --> 06:26.863
No one who lives here.
Family was gone at the time.

06:26.865 --> 06:28.197
Somebody was here.

06:28.199 --> 06:29.432
Nobody pours a second drink

06:29.434 --> 06:32.268
when their first drink's
sitting two feet away.

06:33.504 --> 06:37.273
I'm not feeling natural causes.

06:43.067 --> 06:49.967
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elderman.

07:05.794 --> 07:07.427
I heard shouting.

07:07.429 --> 07:09.896
What kind of shouting?
A domestic dispute?

07:09.898 --> 07:11.265
Domestic meaning
man and a woman?

07:11.267 --> 07:13.700
- Yeah.
- No, Bruce and another man.

07:13.702 --> 07:15.102
Could you make out who?

07:15.104 --> 07:17.871
Bruce was the loud one, so no.

07:17.873 --> 07:19.806
Unusual to hear fighting
coming from there?

07:19.808 --> 07:23.043
Things have been very quiet
since Joan left him.

07:23.045 --> 07:24.378
His wife left him? When?

07:24.380 --> 07:25.445
Must be six months ago

07:25.447 --> 07:27.080
the financial difficulties
came to light,

07:27.082 --> 07:29.049
so... five months?

07:29.051 --> 07:30.217
Financial?

07:30.219 --> 07:32.386
Bruce was into private equity,

07:32.388 --> 07:33.420
buying and selling companies.

07:33.422 --> 07:34.421
He overbought

07:34.423 --> 07:36.223
a couple he couldn't sell

07:36.225 --> 07:37.858
and lost it all.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.926
So, this what
the poorhouse looks like?

07:39.928 --> 07:41.194
I meant liquidity.

07:41.196 --> 07:42.729
And that's why
his wife left him?

07:42.731 --> 07:44.865
I assume it was the trigger.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.333
They were a lovely couple,

07:46.335 --> 07:48.402
but maybe it was the money
that made them that.

07:48.404 --> 07:51.071
How long have you known
the Daniels family?

07:51.073 --> 07:53.373
Almost 20 years.
Since the day they moved in.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.708
You and Bruce drink together?

07:54.710 --> 07:56.677
I don't drink.

07:56.679 --> 07:59.112
Did Bruce drink a lot?

07:59.114 --> 08:01.415
He lost his money
and he lost his family,

08:01.417 --> 08:02.883
all in one fell swoop.

08:02.885 --> 08:06.253
What would you call "drinking
a lot" if you were him?

08:11.759 --> 08:13.960
I am so proud of you.

08:13.962 --> 08:15.762
Thanks, Mom.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.298
The DA actually tried

08:18.300 --> 08:20.200
to snag Robert Jones
for a position

08:20.202 --> 08:21.268
at the office.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.936
Apparently, he is
quite the superstar.

08:22.938 --> 08:25.005
What was he like?

08:25.007 --> 08:27.040
Really cool, actually.
I wasn't expecting that.

08:27.042 --> 08:28.775
Did you meet
a lot of nice people?

08:28.777 --> 08:29.943
It's only my first day.

08:29.945 --> 08:33.313
Well, I'm just asking.

08:33.315 --> 08:35.315
I remember when
I first started working,

08:35.317 --> 08:37.918
and I would introduce
myself, and people would

08:37.919 --> 08:40.287
instantly recognize me as the
commissioner's granddaughter.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.188
That hasn't happened to me yet.

08:42.191 --> 08:43.890
Well, you will find
that sometimes

08:43.892 --> 08:45.726
it works in your favor,
and sometimes

08:45.728 --> 08:47.461
it works against you.

08:47.463 --> 08:49.596
People want to take
advantage of you.

08:50.765 --> 08:53.400
But you...

08:53.402 --> 08:55.736
won't really run into that,
will you?

08:56.871 --> 08:59.940
How did you find out?

08:59.942 --> 09:02.008
How'd you decide on Boyle
instead of Reagan?

09:02.010 --> 09:05.846
I just wanted a clean slate.

09:05.848 --> 09:08.048
My own slate.

09:10.685 --> 09:12.486
You could have at least told me.

09:15.056 --> 09:17.090
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.127
Okay.

09:20.129 --> 09:22.129
It's okay.

09:22.131 --> 09:24.464
Just remember that you...

09:24.466 --> 09:27.067
you are a piece of me, too.

09:37.779 --> 09:39.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:39.381 --> 09:40.914
You get an address
on Mrs. Daniels?

09:40.916 --> 09:42.549
She said she'd prefer
to come down here.

09:42.551 --> 09:44.217
Who in their right mind prefers

09:44.219 --> 09:45.886
to come into a police station?

09:45.888 --> 09:47.554
A notguilty party.

09:47.556 --> 09:49.489
She's guilty in my book.
Who leaves her husband

09:49.491 --> 09:50.957
just because he lost some money?

09:50.959 --> 09:52.926
At the end of the day,
marriage is a contract.

09:52.928 --> 09:55.495
Well, I'm sure her husband
going belly up

09:55.497 --> 09:57.164
isn't what she signed up for.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.666
Yeah, well, life changes.
Things happen.

09:59.668 --> 10:02.569
- You know I know.
- I know.

10:02.571 --> 10:04.070
I'm just saying...

10:04.072 --> 10:05.605
This isn't what
I signed up for, either,

10:05.607 --> 10:07.174
but it is what it is.

10:07.176 --> 10:09.042
Yeah, but you stick it
through every day.

10:09.044 --> 10:10.877
For your family, for your boys.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.012
- That's legit, Danny.
- Yeah.

10:12.014 --> 10:13.079
The one thing I've learned

10:13.081 --> 10:14.714
is that life is beautiful
and it's sad,

10:14.716 --> 10:16.716
but sometimes it's
just practical.

10:16.718 --> 10:18.151
Money counts.

10:18.153 --> 10:19.786
You really believe that?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.960
So, where were you that night?

10:26.962 --> 10:28.795
I already told you, I moved out.

10:28.797 --> 10:30.797
Okay. So where were you
that night?

10:30.799 --> 10:32.766
What, are you asking
for my alibi?

10:32.768 --> 10:34.167
It's protocol.

10:34.169 --> 10:36.236
I was with my mother.

10:36.238 --> 10:38.872
Okay, we'll need your mother
to corroborate your story.

10:38.874 --> 10:40.440
This is ridiculous.

10:40.442 --> 10:42.576
Do you know of anyone who had it
out for your husband?

10:42.578 --> 10:44.344
- No.
- Lost a lot of money

10:44.346 --> 10:45.946
in investments. I'm sure
that made him some enemies.

10:45.948 --> 10:47.981
Well, I wasn't involved
in the business,

10:47.983 --> 10:49.716
so I wouldn't know. Interesting.

10:49.718 --> 10:53.053
Because your neighbor said
that's exactly why you left.

10:54.690 --> 10:56.189
Wayne is a gossipy old queen.

10:56.191 --> 10:57.958
That's not why I left.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.860
So, why did you leave?

10:59.862 --> 11:01.428
We weren't getting along.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.896
And which one

11:02.898 --> 11:05.499
of your sons was it that wasn't
getting along with your husband?

11:05.501 --> 11:06.766
No, they have nothing
to do with this.

11:06.768 --> 11:07.968
I didn't say they did.

11:07.970 --> 11:09.102
This is the last thing
they need.

11:09.104 --> 11:10.637
My sons have been
through enough.

11:10.639 --> 11:12.572
What else
have they been through?

11:12.574 --> 11:14.574
I left.

11:14.576 --> 11:16.543
The world as they knew it

11:16.545 --> 11:18.211
completely fell apart.

11:18.213 --> 11:20.647
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

11:25.354 --> 11:28.688
Look, all I'm asking is
that you cooperate.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.324
I have told you
everything I can.

11:31.326 --> 11:32.926
Tell me everything
that you can't.

11:32.928 --> 11:34.394
Ms. Daniels,

11:34.396 --> 11:37.063
anything that you tell me
could be relevant.

11:37.065 --> 11:39.332
It could help us
figure out who did this.

11:39.334 --> 11:40.901
Well, that's not my priority.

11:40.903 --> 11:44.871
Well, fortunately for Bruce,
it's my priority.

11:53.482 --> 11:55.348
Commissioner Reagan,

11:55.350 --> 11:56.917
Officer Witten.

11:56.919 --> 11:58.685
Commissioner Reagan.

11:58.687 --> 12:01.021
DCPI Moore.

12:02.056 --> 12:04.224
Have a seat.

12:12.333 --> 12:16.002
Take it easy, Officer.

12:16.004 --> 12:19.372
Thank you.

12:19.374 --> 12:21.474
So, walk us through the stop.

12:21.476 --> 12:25.745
I was looking for discrepancies,
just as I was trained to do.

12:25.747 --> 12:28.214
I'd been assigned the same

12:28.216 --> 12:31.251
foot post for a few weeks,
and Rivera...

12:31.253 --> 12:33.320
well, he looked out of place.

12:33.322 --> 12:34.554
How so?

12:34.556 --> 12:37.691
The neighborhood is
predominantly Caucasian.

12:37.693 --> 12:39.659
We don't have

12:39.661 --> 12:41.728
checkpoints or borders here,
Officer.

12:41.730 --> 12:43.063
No.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.731
What did he do wrong?

12:44.733 --> 12:47.200
I noticed him jaywalking
just before I stopped him.

12:47.202 --> 12:49.202
That's not a crime.
And not the only reason

12:49.204 --> 12:51.338
I picked him up.
There's been a spike

12:51.340 --> 12:53.506
in pushin robberies
in that neighborhood recently.

12:53.508 --> 12:56.376
And Rivera fit the
description of the suspect.

12:56.378 --> 12:58.378
- So you approached him?
- Yes.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.747
And when I asked Rivera what he
was doing in that neighborhood,

13:00.749 --> 13:02.082
he didn't have an answer.

13:02.084 --> 13:04.451
And when I asked him for ID,
he refused.

13:04.453 --> 13:05.485
Which he's free to do.

13:05.487 --> 13:07.020
He wouldn't cooperate.

13:07.022 --> 13:08.855
And the crowd was getting
out of hand.

13:08.857 --> 13:13.393
Did you feel threatened
for your life or Rivera's?

13:13.395 --> 13:15.328
No.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.430
I was doing
what I was trained to do.

13:17.432 --> 13:20.667
Frankly, I don't see a problem.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.736
Thank you, Officer.

13:22.738 --> 13:24.604
That'll be all.

13:36.651 --> 13:38.852
Well?

13:41.022 --> 13:43.323
She doesn't see a problem?

13:43.325 --> 13:45.258
She went by the book,

13:45.260 --> 13:47.661
and we're trained
that book's the Bible.

13:47.663 --> 13:48.928
And like the Bible,

13:48.930 --> 13:52.799
the wrong translation
can cause more harm than good.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.777
My dad cut me off
a few months ago.

14:03.779 --> 14:04.778
Cut you off how?

14:04.780 --> 14:05.879
Cut off my credit cards.

14:05.881 --> 14:07.514
He cut off communication, too?

14:07.516 --> 14:09.616
No, but I did.

14:09.618 --> 14:10.650
Why'd you do that?

14:10.652 --> 14:12.218
I regret it, okay?

14:12.220 --> 14:13.720
I wish I could take it all back,

14:13.722 --> 14:15.221
just talk to him
for even a second.

14:15.223 --> 14:17.457
When was your last conversation?

14:17.459 --> 14:19.492
I don't remember.

14:19.494 --> 14:20.760
That's interesting,

14:20.762 --> 14:22.996
'cause we do.

14:22.998 --> 14:24.364
We have footage of you entering

14:24.366 --> 14:26.499
your father's home
the night he was killed.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.636
Why are you lying to us?

14:29.638 --> 14:31.805
Look, I... I just wanted
to talk to him,

14:31.807 --> 14:33.506
but he didn't want
to talk to me.

14:33.508 --> 14:34.874
You said you cut off
communication.

14:34.876 --> 14:36.609
Why would you want
to talk to him?

14:36.611 --> 14:38.812
Look, my dad was not a nice guy.

14:38.814 --> 14:40.447
He ever hurt you?

14:40.449 --> 14:41.648
No.

14:41.650 --> 14:44.350
He... he wasn't physical,
just mean.

14:44.352 --> 14:46.920
Mean how?
He worked all of the time.

14:46.922 --> 14:49.723
So working all the time...
That made him mean?

14:49.725 --> 14:51.658
- No. He...
- Seems like

14:51.660 --> 14:53.927
all that hard work afforded you
quite a life.

14:53.929 --> 14:56.596
Which he held over my head
every single day.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.365
Where did you go
after you saw your father?

14:59.367 --> 15:01.634
Here. I was here with her.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.203
What time? I don't know.

15:03.205 --> 15:04.304
Before dinner?

15:04.306 --> 15:07.140
- What you two have for dinner?
- What?

15:07.142 --> 15:08.341
It was two days ago.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.710
What did you and your girlfriend
have for dinner?

15:12.480 --> 15:15.815
I don't know.
Just stuff around the house.

15:15.817 --> 15:17.383
So if we take a look
in the frigerator,

15:17.385 --> 15:18.785
we might find something

15:18.787 --> 15:21.287
that one of you two
could whip up for dinner?

15:21.289 --> 15:22.522
I'm done with this.

15:22.524 --> 15:23.890
We're not.

15:23.892 --> 15:25.859
Yeah, we are.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.362
I want to see my lawyer.

15:36.437 --> 15:39.272
Ballpark. Yup, I understand.

15:39.274 --> 15:41.574
I got to say, Mr. Romano,
that's the kind of ballpark

15:41.576 --> 15:44.177
I'd really like
to be playing in.

15:44.179 --> 15:47.814
And I'm pretty good at the game,
if I do say so myself.

15:50.719 --> 15:53.286
No. No problem with the timing.

15:53.288 --> 15:55.355
Timing couldn't be more perfect.

15:55.357 --> 15:58.158
Okay, I'll see you then.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.693
Thank you for the opportunity.

16:00.695 --> 16:03.296
They start softball already?

16:04.035 --> 16:06.257
Sounds like you're playing
in that bar league again.

16:06.268 --> 16:07.433
What makes you say that?

16:07.435 --> 16:09.469
"Ballgame I'm good at."

16:09.471 --> 16:10.837
I'm a detective, you know?

16:10.839 --> 16:13.439
You don't miss a thing, do you?

16:13.441 --> 16:16.643
But it's not that kind
of opportunity.

16:16.645 --> 16:18.244
See you later.

16:18.246 --> 16:20.880
See you later, Danny.

16:20.882 --> 16:23.349
My wife and kids

16:23.351 --> 16:25.485
are everything to me.

16:25.487 --> 16:27.153
And their wellbeing
would be your mission.

16:27.155 --> 16:28.354
I understand.

16:28.356 --> 16:31.024
I can offer you 250 K a year.

16:33.327 --> 16:34.694
Plus benefits.

16:34.696 --> 16:37.063
Any catch? Well, you know,

16:37.065 --> 16:39.299
your hours can be a little fluid
when we're traveling,

16:39.301 --> 16:41.067
and I can only offer three weeks

16:41.069 --> 16:42.602
paid vacation,
but if you don't use them,

16:42.604 --> 16:44.537
I'll let you roll them
into the following year.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.307
Are you interested?

16:49.143 --> 16:51.878
Sounds easy enough.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.714
Can I get back to you on Monday?

16:54.716 --> 16:56.850
Is this a negotiation tactic?

16:56.852 --> 17:00.053
No. I need to discuss it
with my kids.

17:00.055 --> 17:02.522
I understand.

17:02.524 --> 17:06.593
Are you speaking to anyone
else about the position?

17:06.595 --> 17:09.362
None with quite your CV.

17:09.364 --> 17:11.297
But I do need to fill the job.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.669
- Okay. I'll speak to you Monday.
- Great.

17:16.671 --> 17:18.972
- Looking forward to it.
- Same here.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.494
Hey. I would cut it
out with that makeup.

17:41.496 --> 17:43.229
Excuse me?

17:43.231 --> 17:45.431
Anything girly draws
attention to you here.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.266
Don't even think about
wearing a skirt.

17:47.268 --> 17:49.435
All I read was
"business casual."

17:49.437 --> 17:51.370
It's an unspoken thing.

17:51.372 --> 17:52.738
- To look less girly?
- Yeah.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.607
There are tons of men
in the office.

17:54.609 --> 17:56.675
Men are everywhere.

17:58.246 --> 18:00.413
It's different here.

18:00.415 --> 18:03.015
Here, men have a say over you.

18:03.017 --> 18:06.285
So, what, I'm just supposed
to wear a potato sack?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.155
That's crazy. I can't do that.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.992
What?

18:12.994 --> 18:14.527
Nothing.

18:14.529 --> 18:15.694
No. Please.

18:15.696 --> 18:17.663
It's just,

18:17.665 --> 18:19.965
you're not the first
new girl to come in here

18:19.967 --> 18:22.001
thinking she's gonna
change the way things work.

18:22.003 --> 18:24.203
- Someone should.
- I agree.

18:24.205 --> 18:26.972
But that someone's gonna have
to be a male someone.

18:26.974 --> 18:28.741
Bobby is aware of all of this?

18:28.743 --> 18:29.942
Bobby?

18:29.944 --> 18:31.277
What?

18:31.279 --> 18:32.545
Let me guess.

18:32.547 --> 18:34.780
He wanted to get to know you,

18:34.782 --> 18:36.449
made you laugh, all while

18:36.451 --> 18:38.117
flashing that killer smile?

18:38.119 --> 18:40.519
You make him sound awful.

18:40.521 --> 18:42.588
He's not.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.957
But he's not a part
of the solution, either.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.936
I mean, look,
if I fired every rookie

18:56.938 --> 18:59.171
that made a rookie mistake,
what would we have left?

18:59.173 --> 19:01.073
Army Rangers?

19:01.075 --> 19:02.475
Or Navy Seals. Exactly.

19:02.477 --> 19:04.777
Nice in theory, but...

19:04.779 --> 19:09.048
I mean, there's a reason
there aren't 35,000 Navy Seals.

19:09.050 --> 19:12.118
And it sure ain't because
the Navy couldn't use 'em.

19:15.757 --> 19:18.991
Listen, boss, can I say
something just for this room?

19:18.993 --> 19:22.194
Sure.

19:22.196 --> 19:25.564
Do you think, possibly,

19:25.566 --> 19:31.404
it has something to do
with her being... a her?

19:31.406 --> 19:33.406
Come on, Sid.

19:33.408 --> 19:35.274
It's 2018, even in this room.

19:35.276 --> 19:36.609
Okay.

19:36.611 --> 19:38.177
All right. Never mind.

19:39.913 --> 19:44.083
"Her..." in what way?

19:44.085 --> 19:48.988
Two cop uncles, and her father
an FDNY battalion chief?

19:48.990 --> 19:51.257
Bet she either gave
hurt or got hurt

19:51.259 --> 19:53.659
at the family football game
Thanksgiving every year.

19:53.661 --> 19:56.195
You know, trying too hard,
going too fast,

19:56.197 --> 19:58.130
punching above her weight.

19:58.132 --> 20:00.866
Overcompensating.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.334
Yeah, that, too.

20:19.119 --> 20:20.853
What is it?

20:20.855 --> 20:23.389
I don't know if you want
to do anything with this,

20:23.391 --> 20:25.291
but I think you should know it.

20:25.293 --> 20:27.093
I just got word
there's something's wrong

20:27.095 --> 20:29.862
with Officer Witten's
perp, Rivera.

20:29.864 --> 20:30.830
Yeah, he's in jail.

20:30.832 --> 20:32.898
Wrong how? He's freaking out.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.633
And there's a whole
crossagency fight

20:34.635 --> 20:35.835
about moving him to a hospital.

20:35.837 --> 20:38.404
- Is it a ploy?
- Well, that's the thing.

20:38.406 --> 20:39.805
He's not asking to be moved.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.373
He's just freaking out,

20:41.375 --> 20:44.110
and no one wants a fuzzy
causeofdeath on their hands.

20:54.121 --> 20:55.554
Come in.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.390
You wanted to see me?

20:58.392 --> 21:01.627
I wanted to talk to you, yeah.

21:01.629 --> 21:03.762
The other day...

21:05.165 --> 21:07.333
did we get off
on the wrong foot?

21:07.335 --> 21:09.068
Not... No.

21:09.070 --> 21:10.503
You seemed nervous.

21:10.505 --> 21:12.538
Diddid I make you
uncomfortable somehow?

21:12.540 --> 21:16.242
No, no. Just...
firstday jitters.

21:16.244 --> 21:17.309
You promise?

21:17.311 --> 21:19.278
Yeah. All good.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.680
'Cause I never really learned
how to be aa boss boss.

21:21.682 --> 21:23.983
You know? If anything,

21:23.985 --> 21:26.785
all this boss stuff just
makes me uncomfortable.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.722
I should get back to work.

21:29.724 --> 21:31.557
Some of us are going out
to dinner tonight

21:31.559 --> 21:34.627
before the TED Talk.
You should come.

21:34.629 --> 21:36.128
I wouldn't want to intrude.

21:36.130 --> 21:38.197
You wouldn't be intruding,
and it's a good opportunity

21:38.199 --> 21:39.598
for you to get to know
the staff here.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.200
I just have to check.
I have a...

21:41.202 --> 21:43.402
Of course. I didn't realize
I was inviting

21:43.404 --> 21:46.105
the most popular girl
north of 14th Street.

21:46.107 --> 21:48.908
I didn't mean it like that.

21:48.910 --> 21:50.142
So you'll come.

21:50.144 --> 21:51.477
Dinner is at 7:00.

21:51.479 --> 21:52.878
I'll text you the restaurant.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.382
Okay. See you then.

21:57.184 --> 21:59.885
Yep. Monday morning, 6:00 a.m.

21:59.887 --> 22:01.687
You got it. Thank you.

22:01.689 --> 22:03.756
What was that about?

22:03.758 --> 22:04.957
Nothing.

22:04.959 --> 22:07.960
Come on. We work together,
remember?

22:07.962 --> 22:09.428
But not at 6:00 a.m.

22:09.430 --> 22:12.665
Okay. It's about the guy

22:12.667 --> 22:15.834
offered me a job running
his personal security.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.270
A guy? What guy?

22:18.272 --> 22:21.006
A guy who pays 250K a year
for someone

22:21.008 --> 22:22.274
to run his personal security.

22:22.276 --> 22:25.578
Wow. He got a brother
who's also insecure?

22:25.580 --> 22:27.179
I'll ask.

22:27.181 --> 22:30.416
But, you know, if I cash out
my pension, that's 115,

22:30.418 --> 22:31.750
plus the 250,

22:31.752 --> 22:33.752
that's 365K a year.

22:33.754 --> 22:35.254
Yeah, I can do the math, Danny.

22:35.256 --> 22:38.023
And the math here is,
you're not gonna take it.

22:38.025 --> 22:41.193
- Well, I think I am.
- Nah.

22:41.195 --> 22:42.695
You do realize that I used to be

22:42.697 --> 22:45.531
in a twoincome household?
Now it's only one.

22:45.533 --> 22:48.534
That I used to have a partner
and now I'm the only parent.

22:48.536 --> 22:50.736
I got to still raise
these two boys.

22:50.738 --> 22:52.371
It's a good thing for us.

22:52.373 --> 22:54.240
You'd miss the action too much.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.442
I would miss the action.

22:56.444 --> 23:00.446
But somehow where the job
used to seem noble...

23:00.448 --> 23:04.183
as a single parent, now it
just kind of seems selfish.

23:06.086 --> 23:08.053
What about the boys?

23:08.055 --> 23:09.521
Don't they get a say?

23:09.523 --> 23:11.690
Or me?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.015
Where is everybody?

23:36.017 --> 23:38.417
Stood me up.
Can you believe that?

23:38.419 --> 23:40.219
Nobody could come?

23:40.221 --> 23:41.420
They said they'd come meet us

23:41.422 --> 23:43.122
after the TED Talk.

23:43.124 --> 23:45.524
Appreciate you not
leaving me to eat alone.

23:45.526 --> 23:47.660
No problem.

23:47.662 --> 23:49.762
Something to drink?

23:49.764 --> 23:50.929
Sure.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.932
I'll get us a
nice bottle of red.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.367
Gina.

23:55.369 --> 23:57.269
- You like red?
- Yeah.

23:57.271 --> 23:59.638
Any more of the '05 Montrose?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.206
I saved one for you.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.475
You spoil me, Gina.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.880
So... how are you liking

24:07.882 --> 24:09.615
your first...

24:10.917 --> 24:12.551
I got to take this.

24:12.553 --> 24:13.619
Give me, like, 30 seconds. Sure.

24:13.621 --> 24:15.354
Hey.

24:15.356 --> 24:18.757
Yeah. Hey. I need you

24:18.759 --> 24:21.260
to hold on a minute,
okay? Hold on.

24:21.262 --> 24:22.795
This is gonna be a minute.

24:22.797 --> 24:24.363
It's too loud in here.

24:24.365 --> 24:26.165
I live right down the block.

24:26.167 --> 24:29.802
I'm going to have them
send something up for us.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.575
Hey. You there?

24:36.577 --> 24:39.144
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna call
you back in, like, five,

24:39.146 --> 24:41.413
when I'm back
at mine, all right?

24:57.664 --> 24:58.997
Hey. What a nice surprise.

25:07.957 --> 25:09.983
I thought you had that dinner
with your coworkers.

25:10.007 --> 25:11.773
I didn't feel like going.

25:11.775 --> 25:13.842
Why not?

25:13.844 --> 25:16.345
Just didn't.

25:16.347 --> 25:17.446
This is starting to feel like

25:17.448 --> 25:18.614
all those times I would ask you

25:18.616 --> 25:20.616
where you were going,
and you'd say, "Out."

25:20.618 --> 25:22.050
I just feel bad.

25:22.052 --> 25:23.519
I shouldn't have
put "Nicky Boyle"

25:23.521 --> 25:25.254
on the application.

25:25.256 --> 25:29.091
It's okay. Really, I understand.

25:29.093 --> 25:30.225
But is that it?

25:30.227 --> 25:33.629
Yeah. Can we have
a glass of wine?

25:34.664 --> 25:37.032
Sure. Right after you tell me

25:37.034 --> 25:38.367
why you blew off dinner

25:38.369 --> 25:40.435
and showed up on my doorstep.

25:40.437 --> 25:41.670
It'slt's not a big deal.

25:41.672 --> 25:43.372
Okay, what's not a big deal?

25:43.374 --> 25:45.841
I just made a mistake at work,
but I can handle it.

25:45.843 --> 25:47.009
What kind of mistake?

25:47.011 --> 25:48.210
With my boss.

25:48.212 --> 25:49.311
That's a who, not a what.

25:49.313 --> 25:50.746
I would really like to deal

25:50.748 --> 25:52.014
with this myself, okay?

25:52.016 --> 25:53.415
That's why I wanted
to use the name Boyle

25:53.417 --> 25:54.783
in the first place. Remember?

25:54.785 --> 25:56.351
A clean slate.

25:59.222 --> 26:00.722
Red or white?

26:00.724 --> 26:03.025
I'll take red.

26:11.267 --> 26:14.202
Detective.

26:14.204 --> 26:16.038
Mrs. Daniels...

26:16.040 --> 26:17.739
I would like to make
a statement.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.441
What kind of statement?

26:19.443 --> 26:21.043
A confession.

26:22.679 --> 26:24.146
Okay.

26:24.148 --> 26:27.482
It was me. I killed my husband.

26:27.484 --> 26:29.451
What did you use?

26:29.453 --> 26:31.153
- For what?
- To kill your husband.

26:31.155 --> 26:32.955
What kind of poison did you use?

26:32.957 --> 26:35.023
Something I found
in the cupboard.

26:35.025 --> 26:36.358
What was it?

26:36.360 --> 26:37.759
I don't know.

26:39.095 --> 26:40.295
Maybe the real question is

26:40.297 --> 26:41.964
who are you covering for?

26:52.075 --> 26:53.141
You already knew?

26:53.143 --> 26:56.712
Things we do for our children.

26:57.981 --> 27:00.315
I just never thought he
would be capable of this.

27:00.317 --> 27:04.086
You weren't there that night,
but Will was.

27:04.088 --> 27:06.455
I didn't raise him this way.

27:06.457 --> 27:09.691
You implicating your son,
Mrs. Daniels?

27:10.426 --> 27:11.526
'Cause to be honest with you,

27:11.528 --> 27:13.762
the DA was actually
looking for more.

27:13.764 --> 27:17.666
And I just gave it to you.

27:26.909 --> 27:29.478
Sir, may I ask
what we're doing here?

27:29.480 --> 27:32.981
You're following up
on your collar.

27:32.983 --> 27:35.484
Hold on a minute.

27:38.588 --> 27:40.088
You know he's got a problem?

27:40.090 --> 27:44.493
Well, Rivera's claustrophobic.

27:46.596 --> 27:48.597
How'd you know?

27:48.599 --> 27:50.899
He told me on the way
to the precinct,

27:50.901 --> 27:53.835
but I just thought he was
trying to get out of it.

27:53.837 --> 27:54.870
So you knew?

27:54.872 --> 27:57.739
Yeah, but I didn't believe him.

27:57.741 --> 28:00.642
People cry wolf all the time
to get out of jams.

28:00.644 --> 28:02.844
No crying wolf here.

28:04.847 --> 28:07.949
Can you let him out,
even just for a minute?

28:07.951 --> 28:10.185
Afraid not.

28:10.187 --> 28:11.787
Will he be in here very long?

28:11.789 --> 28:14.322
Depends on how crowded
the immigration courts are.

28:14.324 --> 28:16.324
Can't we get him
some kind of treatment?

28:16.326 --> 28:18.093
You put him in jail,

28:18.095 --> 28:20.262
not a hospital.

28:47.957 --> 28:49.024
How you doing?

28:49.026 --> 28:51.560
I'm sorry I was
uncooperative before,

28:51.562 --> 28:54.029
but this is very hard for me.

28:56.065 --> 28:57.099
This happen to you before?

28:57.101 --> 28:59.367
I spent months in a cell

28:59.369 --> 29:01.803
as a political prisoner
in Venezuela.

29:06.843 --> 29:07.876
You know,

29:07.878 --> 29:11.079
I had a partner back in the day,

29:11.081 --> 29:13.815
and he was claustrophobic.

29:13.817 --> 29:17.152
And I would just talk
to him all the time,

29:17.154 --> 29:19.354
you know, keep him talking.

29:19.356 --> 29:21.823
And I think it helped.

29:21.825 --> 29:24.259
Think it might help you?

29:24.261 --> 29:27.028
I think so.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.630
I'd like to try.

29:31.968 --> 29:35.337
What if I stayed with you
for a little while?

29:39.909 --> 29:41.376
Only if you want.

29:42.779 --> 29:45.013
I want to.

29:50.586 --> 29:53.221
Thank you.

30:18.414 --> 30:19.548
Detectives.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.449
Mind if we come in?

30:21.451 --> 30:23.084
Yeah. I just got something
I think you should read.

30:23.086 --> 30:25.487
Whoa, whoa, the only thing
you need to do

30:25.489 --> 30:27.355
is grab your jacket,
'cause you're coming with us.

30:27.357 --> 30:28.957
What? No, you should read this.

30:28.959 --> 30:30.058
II just got it in the mail.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.294
What is it? It's from my dad.

30:33.196 --> 30:34.462
An apology.

30:34.464 --> 30:37.098
What do you mean, an apology?

30:37.100 --> 30:38.300
What's he sorry for?

30:38.302 --> 30:39.935
We got in a fight
that night. Okay?

30:39.937 --> 30:42.304
- I lied.
- So you admit it?

30:43.673 --> 30:46.074
It's all my fault.

30:47.543 --> 30:50.612
Where did you get the poison?

30:50.614 --> 30:51.780
The what?!

30:51.782 --> 30:53.615
The poison that you used
to kill your father...

30:53.617 --> 30:54.616
Where'd you get it?

30:54.618 --> 30:56.551
No, no, I didn't...

30:56.553 --> 30:58.186
I didn't kill him.

30:58.188 --> 30:59.754
Then what the hell
is this all about?!

30:59.756 --> 31:02.257
I just said horrible,
horrible things to him.

31:02.259 --> 31:06.428
Thethe last things
I will ever say to my father.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.797
Why did your mother try
to take the fall for you?

31:08.799 --> 31:09.928
What?

31:09.952 --> 31:11.400
Your mother came
down to the squad room

31:11.401 --> 31:14.202
and said she killed your father,
to cover for you.

31:14.204 --> 31:18.206
Wow, my own mother thinks
I'm that much of a monster.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.242
She just assumed you killed him?

31:20.244 --> 31:22.677
I told her we got
into a fight that night,

31:22.679 --> 31:26.147
and sheshe just went nuts, and

31:26.149 --> 31:27.749
was yelling about how
I was gonna go to jail.

31:27.751 --> 31:29.651
And... she wouldn't
listen to me.

31:29.653 --> 31:31.887
So, if you didn't kill him,
then who did?

31:33.323 --> 31:35.957
Apparently, Bruce
killed himself.

31:38.194 --> 31:40.896
At least, that's what he says
he was gonna do in this letter.

31:40.898 --> 31:43.765
It's a suicide note.

31:51.941 --> 31:54.843
We had a great time last night,
but you were missed.

31:54.845 --> 31:58.346
I couldn't come
to your apartment, Mr. Jones.

32:04.086 --> 32:07.389
I want you to succeed here.

32:07.391 --> 32:09.791
Do you want to succeed here?

32:09.793 --> 32:12.293
I feel really uncomfortable here.

32:12.663 --> 32:15.897
It's not always a bad thing
when somebody makes you a little nervous.

32:15.899 --> 32:17.299
It can be good.

32:17.301 --> 32:19.434
Exciting, even.

32:19.436 --> 32:20.769
That's not
what I'm talking about.

32:20.771 --> 32:22.904
Okay, why don't we do a
rain check at your place?

32:22.906 --> 32:24.406
You'll feel
more comfortable there.

32:24.408 --> 32:25.774
- No, I wouldn't.
- Come on.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.442
Don't leave me hanging.

32:27.444 --> 32:29.010
I'll come up to you.

32:29.012 --> 32:30.278
You know where I live?

32:30.280 --> 32:31.813
It's on your start paperwork.

32:31.815 --> 32:33.014
Hey,

32:33.016 --> 32:35.116
don't confuse nervous

32:35.118 --> 32:36.818
with excited.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.720
Hey, stop!

32:38.722 --> 32:40.455
You don't want me to stop.

32:41.391 --> 32:43.224
I said stop!

33:42.071 --> 33:45.206
Guys, I got to admit something.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.875
Things aren't exactly okay.

33:47.877 --> 33:49.243
Yeah, we know.

33:49.245 --> 33:50.645
It's not breaking news.

33:50.647 --> 33:52.246
No, I mean money's tight.

33:52.248 --> 33:54.983
Without your mom's income,
it's getting tighter.

33:54.985 --> 33:56.751
I don't want to stretch
overtime so much

33:56.753 --> 33:59.120
that I can't even enjoy
what little time we have left

33:59.122 --> 34:00.622
as the three amigos.

34:00.624 --> 34:01.990
So what are you saying?

34:01.992 --> 34:04.726
I'm saying I'm leaving the NYPD.

34:06.029 --> 34:07.962
I'm gonna take a
higher paying job.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.797
A much higher paying job.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.032
But Dad, you love your job.

34:11.034 --> 34:13.101
Yeah, well, I love
you guys more.

34:13.103 --> 34:16.371
And it's as simple, and
as complicated, as that.

34:17.606 --> 34:19.774
What would you be doing?

34:19.775 --> 34:22.710
Private security for a
rich guy and his family.

34:22.712 --> 34:23.811
Is he famous?

34:23.813 --> 34:24.978
No.

34:24.981 --> 34:26.681
So just some rich guy...

34:26.683 --> 34:28.016
And his rich kids?

34:29.085 --> 34:30.652
That's how you put it.
Okay, for me,

34:30.654 --> 34:32.786
it's just a gig. A good gig.

34:32.789 --> 34:35.123
We love what you do now.
We're proud of you.

34:35.125 --> 34:39.060
Yeah, we really love
bragging about you, Dad.

34:46.902 --> 34:49.469
What's Officer Witten's
relationship

34:49.472 --> 34:51.371
to the other cops in her house?

34:51.373 --> 34:54.308
Good. They're all 100%
behind her, what I hear.

34:54.310 --> 34:56.377
Not a single Latino cop
took issue?

34:56.379 --> 34:58.346
I didn't do a doortodoor survey.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.480
But odds would be...

34:59.482 --> 35:01.683
What I hear is all I know.

35:01.685 --> 35:04.686
And her CO, any issues there?

35:04.688 --> 35:06.387
Also solid, what I hear.

35:06.389 --> 35:07.855
Also, I think she's an old pal

35:07.857 --> 35:09.891
to either the uncle
or the father.

35:09.893 --> 35:12.393
And your relationship to her CO?

35:12.395 --> 35:14.162
Jimmy Vauxhall?

35:14.164 --> 35:15.363
Good as gold.

35:15.365 --> 35:18.499
Then we're good to go.

35:19.635 --> 35:21.269
Go where?

35:21.271 --> 35:23.905
You, to him, privately,
with a message,

35:23.907 --> 35:28.142
to confer
with the advocate's office...

35:30.012 --> 35:32.947
to terminate Officer Witten.

35:34.783 --> 35:36.784
For?

35:39.655 --> 35:41.422
Failed probation.

35:41.424 --> 35:45.526
For bringing undue criticism
to this department.

35:45.528 --> 35:46.627
We're throwing her

35:46.629 --> 35:48.963
under the bus
to throw Garrett a favor?

35:48.965 --> 35:50.264
No.

35:50.266 --> 35:52.800
We are terminating her
for cause.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.569
I want it done
at the precinct level,

35:54.571 --> 35:57.705
so the word goes out
at that level,

35:57.707 --> 36:00.174
to rank and file.

36:02.578 --> 36:05.179
Boss? Can I ask why, then?

36:13.255 --> 36:18.092
"By general law, life and limb
must be protected.

36:18.094 --> 36:20.728
"Yet often, a limb

36:20.730 --> 36:23.931
"must be amputated
to save a life;

36:23.933 --> 36:26.567
"But a life

36:26.569 --> 36:30.538
is never wisely given
to save a limb."

36:30.540 --> 36:32.707
Abraham Lincoln.

36:38.247 --> 36:42.083
This department is the life.

36:42.085 --> 36:45.286
Officer Witten is a limb.

37:01.204 --> 37:04.138
I quit.

37:05.742 --> 37:07.441
What did he do?

37:07.443 --> 37:09.177
I didn't say he did anything.

37:09.179 --> 37:11.245
It wouldn't be the first time,
you know.

37:11.247 --> 37:12.980
You said you would let me
handle this.

37:12.982 --> 37:14.582
And I did.

37:14.584 --> 37:16.217
Look, you were right, okay?

37:16.219 --> 37:17.685
If I'd used the Reagan name,

37:17.687 --> 37:19.020
none of this
would have happened.

37:19.022 --> 37:22.857
I would have still had my
internship and my dignity.

37:22.859 --> 37:26.227
That is not the point, and your
name is not the problem here.

37:27.963 --> 37:29.864
Look, you're not alone
in this, Nicky.

37:29.866 --> 37:32.900
I think you would find
that most women

37:32.902 --> 37:35.102
have a version of this story.

37:35.104 --> 37:37.872
I'm just embarrassed.

37:39.408 --> 37:41.876
You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

37:41.878 --> 37:44.045
Nothing. Do you hear me?

37:51.386 --> 37:53.788
Three girls walked out
with me today.

38:01.296 --> 38:04.632
Do you think they would talk
to one of my investigators?

38:04.634 --> 38:07.768
I have someone who specializes.

38:07.770 --> 38:10.872
I will talk to them.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.143
Hey.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.414
I'm really proud of you.

38:29.491 --> 38:31.626
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts,

38:31.628 --> 38:34.061
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

38:34.063 --> 38:36.998
through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.634
"These Thy gifts"

38:39.636 --> 38:41.769
doesn't just refer
to meat and potatoes, right?

38:41.771 --> 38:43.004
That's right.
The gifts of family,

38:43.006 --> 38:44.438
of the roof over our heads.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.575
Of the gifts, the talents,
given to us individually.

38:48.344 --> 38:49.477
And here I always thought

38:49.479 --> 38:50.912
it was just about the food.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.514
Maybe you should pay attention
when you're saying grace.

38:53.516 --> 38:55.149
What you're grateful for.

38:55.151 --> 38:56.317
Okay.

38:56.319 --> 38:57.652
Your gifts.

38:57.654 --> 38:59.387
Yours in particular.

38:59.389 --> 39:01.355
All of a sudden, I'm so gifted?

39:01.357 --> 39:02.623
Yes.

39:02.625 --> 39:03.758
More than most.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.759
How?

39:04.761 --> 39:06.594
As a detective with the NYPD.

39:06.596 --> 39:09.730
And you'd be just as valuable
to Scotland Yard or Interpol

39:09.732 --> 39:12.033
or the Pinkertons,
back in the day.

39:12.035 --> 39:14.101
God gave you a nose and a gut.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.803
That's a gift.

39:17.307 --> 39:19.240
Yeah, and I think that gift
is starting to tell me

39:19.242 --> 39:20.942
that I'm getting
the business here.

39:22.344 --> 39:23.544
What?

39:23.546 --> 39:26.347
I thought this was
just between us guys, for now.

39:26.349 --> 39:28.215
Yeah, it was,
but you weren't listening to us.

39:28.217 --> 39:29.717
So we clued in the rest of us.

39:29.719 --> 39:30.785
When?

39:30.787 --> 39:33.254
When you went to the bakery
to get the pies.

39:37.759 --> 39:40.294
Okay. Now that we all know...

39:40.296 --> 39:41.963
But nothing we didn't
already know, Danny.

39:41.965 --> 39:43.998
- How's that?
- That college

39:44.000 --> 39:45.866
is outrageously expensive,
that the loss of a second income

39:45.868 --> 39:47.034
is a huge hit.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.302
That you could command more
in the private sector

39:48.304 --> 39:49.971
than the job could ever pay you.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.206
And you're one of a handful
of detectives that I've known

39:52.208 --> 39:55.609
through all these years
who isn't defined by the job,

39:55.611 --> 39:57.378
but defines the job for himself.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.614
Even redefined it,
from where I sit.

40:00.616 --> 40:02.516
And he sits on the top.
I know where he sits.

40:02.518 --> 40:04.051
And all the compliments
are very nice,

40:04.053 --> 40:07.688
but this flattery is not gonna
shrink any of my bills.

40:07.690 --> 40:11.592
No, it won't. But you can't let
paying the bills shrink you.

40:11.594 --> 40:12.827
You know what she means.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.996
And you know she's right.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.999
And you guys act like I have
some kind of choice in all this.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.200
Community college.

40:19.202 --> 40:20.634
Right nearby,
so no room and board.

40:20.636 --> 40:22.336
And what if you get into
a college that you really love

40:22.338 --> 40:23.337
and I can't afford it?

40:23.339 --> 40:24.338
He makes a choice.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.606
He applies for a scholarship.

40:25.608 --> 40:26.674
He takes out a loan.

40:26.676 --> 40:28.542
He could pass the hat
around this table.

40:28.544 --> 40:30.177
Say I'm driving a beater
and see a Ferrari.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.146
I'm gonna think to myself,
"That's a sweet ride,"

40:32.148 --> 40:33.280
and not diss my life

40:33.282 --> 40:34.648
because I'm not driving
a Ferrari.

40:34.650 --> 40:35.650
Smart kid.

40:37.286 --> 40:38.619
He's so smart, he doesn't even
need to go to college.

40:38.621 --> 40:39.754
Problem solved.

40:39.756 --> 40:40.955
Yeah.

40:40.957 --> 40:42.923
Problem solved.

40:46.028 --> 40:48.362
You need to get that?

40:48.364 --> 40:53.934
I thought I had till tomorrow
to, call him.

40:53.936 --> 40:55.636
Excuse me.

40:59.709 --> 41:01.208
Mr. Romano.

41:01.210 --> 41:03.411
Yeah. No, no, it's fine.

41:03.413 --> 41:05.179
Glad you called.
