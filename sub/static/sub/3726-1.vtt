'Getting a little tired
of memorializing Mona.‘

00:13.740 --> 00:16.004
Are you saying that the world's
better off without her?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.277
What the..

00:20.320 --> 00:21.275
Mom!

00:23.390 --> 00:24.345
We know about A.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.681
This A killed my mom
and Mona.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.789
You're not Alison.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.151
[siren blaring]

00:30.190 --> 00:31.282
Every night the main generator

00:31.330 --> 00:32.422
shuts down like clockwork.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.688
It takes exactly three minutes

00:33.730 --> 00:34.719
for the backup power to kick in.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.569
That's the way out,
but you have to climb up.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.067
There's a steel door
at the end of the hall

00:38.100 --> 00:39.260
and it's sealed like a vault.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.530
The blocks in the playroom
spelled out a name, "Charles."

00:41.570 --> 00:43.606
A is recreating a prom
we already had?

00:43.640 --> 00:46.700
What if we use the staircase to
make a grand entrance for All?

00:46.740 --> 00:49.243
- That's where the van is.
- This is the old Campbell Farm.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.441
We've searched the entire
property, there's no one here.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.845
Then where is this place?

00:52.880 --> 00:55.178
You should be standing
up here, Charles.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.711
- Now.
- 'Let's go!‘

00:57.750 --> 01:00.082
Wanna say goodnight to your
sister with a little kiss?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.781
- Is that you, Charles?
- 'Spencer?‘

01:03.360 --> 01:05.282

'Oh, my God.‘

01:50.540 --> 01:52.804
We're still trapped.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.569
(Emily)
We can climb it. Let's go.

01:55.910 --> 01:56.877
Stop!

[instrumental music on speaker]

* Oh give me land
lots of land *

02:10.660 --> 02:12.890

02:12.930 --> 02:15.694
* Don't fence me in

02:15.730 --> 02:19.530
* Let me ride through the wide
open country that I love *

02:19.570 --> 02:22.607
* But don't fence me in

02:22.640 --> 02:26.736
* Let me be by myself
in the evenin' breeze *

02:26.780 --> 02:29.943
* And listen to the murmur
of the cottonwood trees *

02:29.980 --> 02:32.312
* Send me off forever
but I ask you please *

02:32.350 --> 02:33.840
There's no way out.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.848
* Don't fence me in..

02:35.880 --> 02:37.848
I-I'm not going
back down there.

* On my..

02:44.660 --> 02:47.220
* Let me wander over yonder.. *

02:47.260 --> 02:49.524
You maybe a dude
but you're still a bitch.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.561
You guys, in the vault,
I was so close to Charles

02:57.610 --> 02:58.565
I could feel his breath.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.805
Was there anything about
him that you recognized?

03:00.840 --> 03:03.240
- A smell?
- She's not Jenna.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.907
(Spencer)
'1 don't know,
I can't pinpoint it'

03:04.950 --> 03:06.679
but there was something
that was really familiar.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.971
You mean like
the way he moved?

03:08.020 --> 03:09.817
No, it was..

03:09.850 --> 03:12.182
Like when you
meet a pen-pal

03:12.960 --> 03:14.757
or like a cousin

03:14.790 --> 03:16.951
or somebody that you knew
when you were really little.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.981
So you're saying you think
you know Charles a little

03:19.030 --> 03:20.827
but you feel like
you know him a lot?

03:20.860 --> 03:23.465
I can't explain, it was just..
It was just a feeling.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.598
It's gonna get cold
out here tonight.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.803
- Where do you think we are?
- We don't..

03:30.840 --> 03:33.479
We don't know how long we were
out before we got here, so..

03:33.510 --> 03:35.330
We could be in
the Amazon right now.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.506
No, we're in
the northern hemisphere.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.973
- That's the waning moon.
- I was saying that facetiously.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.444
Wow, that's an eleven
letter word, Hanna.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.515
[thunder rumbling]

03:42.550 --> 03:43.585
Oh, my God.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.809
This fence is like
a giant lightning rod.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.850
You gonna let us
fry out here?

03:50.890 --> 03:52.426

[thunder rumbling]

04:26.930 --> 04:28.921
[music continues]

04:39.940 --> 04:42.738
How long can a person
live without food?

04:42.780 --> 04:44.475
Three weeks.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.518
But water's a different story.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.689
Some people can only go
a few days without it.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.517
You know you're dying
when you're not hungry

04:53.560 --> 04:54.356
or thirsty anymore.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.449
It means your organs
are shutting down.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.879
Mine are definitely working.

04:58.930 --> 05:01.899
I'm so thirsty, I'm seriously
considering drinking my own pee.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.591
[chuckles]

05:03.630 --> 05:06.838
I can totally suck on
a pee ice cube right now.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.566
I'd lick sweat
off a jockstrap.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.330
Okay, Emily, you win.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.940
I don't know how much longer
I can handle this.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.800
You can handle it, Aria.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.742
We all can.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.559
[dramatic music]

05:41.640 --> 05:44.507
'Please enter and follow

05:48.580 --> 05:50.639
I mean, I-I'm afraid
to stay up here

05:50.680 --> 05:52.568
but I'm also scared
to death to go back there.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.941
(woman on speaker)
'Please enter and follow
the lighted pathway.‘

05:54.980 --> 05:58.040
You've been here
the longest, Mona.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.115
What do we do?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.651
Maybe this was
our punishment.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.726
Maybe it's not
mad at us anymore.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.594
Let's all stick together.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.858
Always.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.650
* Won't tell
what I said *

07:06.690 --> 07:09.056
* Cause two can
keep a secret *

07:39.890 --> 07:41.619
Is this a hospital?

07:41.660 --> 07:42.979
Looks more like a morgue.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.819
It feels like somebody's
ripping my brain out

07:49.030 --> 07:50.998
What did they do to us?

07:52.030 --> 07:53.930
- Thank God.
- What?

07:53.970 --> 07:56.461
I thought for a second
A harvested our organs.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.669
Emily, we'd be dead.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.837
You only need one kidney.

08:02.110 --> 08:05.705
Hey, guys, I think A
wanted to make us look dead

08:05.750 --> 08:07.172
to send a message
to our families.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.869
What do you mean?

08:08.920 --> 08:11.582
So they'd stop
looking for us.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.656
[wheels creaking]

08:17.560 --> 08:19.596
Aspirin? Juice?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.795
Mona, what the hell
is going on?

08:22.830 --> 08:23.797
What happened to us?

08:23.830 --> 08:26.025
I've asked not_ to call
me that ever again, Hanna.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.129

We're scared.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.073
I'm scared too.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.970
How long have we been here?

08:39.010 --> 08:40.978
How long were we unconscious?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.112
Only a few hours.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.618
I've been in my room until now.
That's all I know.

Please, talk to us.

in the night

27:54.770 --> 27:57.034
Did you guys know that, um

27:57.070 --> 27:58.435
I won an Etch A Sketch contest

27:58.470 --> 28:00.802
when I was in
the third grade?

28:00.840 --> 28:01.875
Of course, you did.

28:01.910 --> 28:04.401
I can draw some really,
really pretty pictures.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.771
[whispering]
The generator still shuts down
with the switch-over.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.347
I heard it too but I was
too scared to leave my room.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.445
See?

28:28.100 --> 28:32.036
* Hush little baby

28:32.070 --> 28:35.870
* Mama's gonna buy
you a mockingbird *

28:35.910 --> 28:39.346
* And if that
mockingbird don't sing *

28:39.380 --> 28:42.770
* Mama's gonna buy
you a diamond ring *

28:44.020 --> 28:47.342
* And if that diamond ring
turns brass *

may I help you?'

(man on speaker)
'What you need is in
the trunk of the car.'

29:56.860 --> 29:59.522
What? What did you say?

29:59.560 --> 30:02.449
(man on speaker)
'I said, open the trunk
of the car, Alison.‘

[dramatic music]

30:13.140 --> 30:14.175
She's still not moving?

30:14.210 --> 30:16.178
No, she's at a dead stop.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.201
That's a poor
choice of words.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.811
Slow down.
We don't wanna get too close.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.146
This doesn't feel right.

30:27.190 --> 30:29.215
'You should call Toby.'

30:39.470 --> 30:40.425
[knock on door]

30:42.000 --> 30:44.036
We got a lead
on Campbell's car.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.298
A vehicle matching
that description

30:45.340 --> 30:46.602
was reported stolen
two weeks ago.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.278
We got the rest
of the plate number

30:48.310 --> 30:49.902
and we tracked it toll road.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.476
- Where?
- Outside Tyler State Park.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.456
(Ezra)
'Where is she?‘

31:06.230 --> 31:08.289
Ali's signal stopped here.

No, no, no.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.474
Which way did she go?

31:36.020 --> 31:37.988
Hey, she put 'em like
this for a reason.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.094
Let's go.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.039
They're all anagrams.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.445
For Charles DiLaurentis.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.311
Some of those toys
in Ali's room were hers

32:35.350 --> 32:36.510
but some of them
were hIS.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.188
I feel like
they grew up together.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.642
If I'm right, everything
that matters most

32:39.690 --> 32:41.009
to Charles is
in this vault.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.311
If we get in, we can use

32:42.360 --> 32:43.657
what's inside to
bargain our way out.

32:43.690 --> 32:45.180
But Mona said
we won't make it

32:45.230 --> 32:46.982
to the vault
before the power comes on.

32:47.030 --> 32:49.624
Okay, if I'm right, this is
as far as we need to go.

32:49.660 --> 32:52.322
I counted the steps to
the vault from the prom room.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.031
- Of course you did.
- It's 84.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.537
And that's just
one hallway over.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.197
Coming back this way,
it's 81 steps.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.208
The vault is on
the other side of this wall.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.502
Yeah, but how does
that help us?

33:00.540 --> 33:01.734
We can't bust through there.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.305
Charles disappeared like Houdini
when Mona came into the room.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.341
So there's gotta be like
a secret passage way

33:06.380 --> 33:08.678
'or like a trapdoor
or something.‘

33:08.720 --> 33:10.142
Wait, do you guys hear that?

33:10.180 --> 33:12.148

is coming back on.

Come on!

33:25.800 --> 33:27.495
There's something
behind this.

33:27.530 --> 33:30.397
Come on, it could be like
a passageway or something.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.532

on a wild goose chase.

Yeah, it wouldn't be
the first time.

Okay. Grab everything.
