00:23.240 --> 00:26.403
If you must blink, do it now.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.648
Pay careful attention
to everything you see and hear,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.131
no matter how unusual it may seem.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.005
And please be warned,

01:31.320 --> 01:35.400
if you fidget, if you look away,

01:35.480 --> 01:38.520
if you forget any part of what I tell you,

01:38.600 --> 01:40.568
even for an instant,

01:42.320 --> 01:44.926
then our hero will surely perish.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.640
His name is Kubo.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.246
His grandfather stole something from him.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.040
And that really is the least of it.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.481
Ow!

07:13.200 --> 07:15.280
Well, hello, Kubo.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.805
How was it today?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.840
It wasn't a bad crowd.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.320
I got two pennies and a lint ball.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.084
This is pretty good lint.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.524
And what have you got planned for today?

07:25.880 --> 07:27.440
Oh, you know, the usual.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.010
- Monsters?
- Of course.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.442
You think you can work
in a fire-breathing chicken?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.571
The chicken again?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.320
The chicken is funny.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.280
A touch of comedy to balance
the whole thing out.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.640
They're gonna be throwing money
at you. I just know it.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.720
Uh, they'll throw something at you.
I don't know.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.080
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.448
And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.447
If you must blink, do it now.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.801
Yay!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.680
Pay careful attention to
everything you see and hear,

08:16.760 --> 08:19.001
no matter how unusual it may seem.

08:19.280 --> 08:24.000
And please be warned,
if you fidget, if you look away,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.160
if you forget any part of what I tell you,

08:26.240 --> 08:31.446
even for an instant,
then our hero will surely perish.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.159
Hanzo was a mighty samurai,
but he was alone.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.767
His family taken from him,
his kingdom in ruins,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.120
and his army destroyed
by the dreaded Moon King.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.920
You may recall, Hanzo was
roaming the distant Far Lands

08:53.000 --> 08:55.240
in search of a magical suit of armor.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.280
The only weapon in the whole world

08:57.360 --> 08:59.966
that could protect him
from the power of the Moon King.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.120
This armor was made up of three pieces.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
- The first...
- Oh! I know! I know!

09:05.360 --> 09:06.771
The sword unbreakable.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.240
The second...

09:13.320 --> 09:15.840
The breastplate...

09:15.920 --> 09:17.240
Impenetrable.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.640
Impenetra-bubble!

09:18.720 --> 09:20.085
Yeah!

09:22.640 --> 09:26.560
And finally, the third weapon,
the final piece of the armor...

09:26.640 --> 09:28.920
I know this one. Pick me!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.320
The helmet invulnerable!

09:34.080 --> 09:35.920
Before Hanzo could claim the armor

09:36.000 --> 09:39.080
and unite the pieces
to reveal their true power,

09:39.160 --> 09:41.481
he was attacked by the Moon King's beast.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.166
Oh, yes!

10:34.320 --> 10:37.529
Kill the chicken! Rip it to pieces.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.845
Oh, my.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.320
Hanzo was filled with rage.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.251
His soul tormented by the grief
of a family stolen from him!

11:39.120 --> 11:44.281
At last, our hero was face-to-face
with his nemesis, the Moon King.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.403
So, be sure to come back tomorrow.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.440
What? Oh, come on!

12:02.520 --> 12:03.760
People like an ending.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.880
Where are you going?

12:05.960 --> 12:08.770
No, you can't... You can't leave!

12:26.520 --> 12:27.681
Kubo.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.322
- Kubo.
- Yes, Mother.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.446
I'm here.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.806
Hungry?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.600
And even though he could barely see

12:40.680 --> 12:43.729
his own hand in front of his face,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.800
Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai

12:46.880 --> 12:48.769
pressed on through the blizzard.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.767
And suddenly, as quickly
as it had started,

12:56.120 --> 12:58.640
the storm cleared before him.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.960
Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he was home.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.200
His fortress?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.800
- The Beetle Clan castle!
- Yes.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.200
At the very edge of the Far Lands,

13:08.280 --> 13:11.204
hidden from the Moon King
by powerful magic.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.201
And then what happened,
when he got to the castle?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.120
When who got to the castle?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.725
Hanzo! My father!

13:19.600 --> 13:22.649
Hanzo... Hanzo was at the castle?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.124
He...

13:25.520 --> 13:28.205
Just give me a second. I'm...

13:28.680 --> 13:30.560
No.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.211
It's gone. I can't...

13:35.320 --> 13:36.481
I'm sorry, Kubo.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.680
Perhaps I could recall a different story.

13:40.760 --> 13:44.287
Mother, what was Father like?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.080
Oh.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.400
This one is easy.

13:49.480 --> 13:54.000
Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.960
No, what was he really like?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.442
When he wasn't fighting,
when he was with us.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.127
He was just like you.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.604
- Like me?
- Yes.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.003
Strong, and clever, and funny,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.880
and, oh, so handsome.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.361
- Ugh. Mother.
- Come on!

14:17.640 --> 14:22.080
Never forget how much he loved you, Kubo.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.891
He died protecting us.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.960
- Did the Moon King...
- Uh.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.405
Your grandfather.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.040
Did Grandfather and your sisters
really kill my father?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.880
It can't be true, can it?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.080
They're family.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.040
No, they are monsters.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.400
Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, Kubo.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.324
They must never find you again. Never!

14:45.640 --> 14:47.720
You must always stay hidden
from the night sky,

14:47.800 --> 14:50.880
or they will find you
and they'll take you away from me.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.160
Promise me you will never let this happen.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.049
Promise me, Kubo!

15:01.920 --> 15:04.730
Don't be sad, Kubo.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.800
Kubo?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.770
Remember what you must do, Kubo?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.527
Remember?

15:12.640 --> 15:15.360
Keep you with me at all times, Mr. Monkey.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.441
And?

15:16.560 --> 15:20.800
And keep Father's robe
on my back at all times.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.006
Yes, Kubo.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.130
And there's one more thing.

15:25.640 --> 15:30.521
Never, ever stay out after dark.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.561
Huh?

15:32.680 --> 15:34.887
Remember?

15:35.840 --> 15:38.280
- Yes, Mr. Monkey.
- Good boy.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.166
Bedtime.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.360
Mother, wake up. You're dreaming.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.602
No. Kubo.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.200
Kubo, is that you?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.964
Yes, Mother. I'm here.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.170
Kubo, what happened to your eye?

17:32.640 --> 17:34.130
Paper boy!

17:34.600 --> 17:35.840
Here, here!

17:36.680 --> 17:38.045
Come on. Come on.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.323
Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.120
What do you think?

17:43.200 --> 17:46.170
I got myself all spruced up
for the big day.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.560
Mmm.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.080
I do so love the festival.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.640
A time to celebrate.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.400
You know, it's a shame
you never stay past sundown.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.484
There's fireworks,
and singing, and dancing,

18:03.760 --> 18:06.120
and feasting, of course.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.362
But the best part of all...

18:08.480 --> 18:10.880
Do you see those lamps and altars?

18:10.960 --> 18:16.171
We use those to speak to
the loved ones that left us behind.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.640
We listen to their tales,

18:18.720 --> 18:22.800
and guide their safe return
to the blissful pure land.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.928
Really? Did you speak to someone?

18:25.040 --> 18:26.769
Yes, I did. My husband.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.080
His voice was as clear and loud

18:30.160 --> 18:32.920
as the one you use for your stories.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.360
In 72 years, he never had a thing to say.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.046
Now he's gone, I can't shut him up.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.960
You have someone you wanna talk to, huh?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.080
Very much.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.720
Well, what's stopping you?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.200
Don't I need a lamp?

18:48.280 --> 18:52.760
Well, I'll bet you could make
a really nice one

18:52.840 --> 18:56.322
with that paper folding thing you do.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.800
You see, not just a pretty face, huh?

19:00.880 --> 19:01.927
Now, hurry along.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.160
Go! There's still time before dark.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.890
Go! Get out of here.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.447
Place the lamp at the altar.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.400
Very good.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.080
What do we do next, Daddy?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.760
Now we pray.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.200
We ask her spirit
to honor us with its light.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.880
Grandma, will you please honor...

19:53.960 --> 19:55.246
Shh.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.963
Softly, softly.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.124
Hello, Father. I hope you're well.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.522
I mean, I know you're dead,
but I hope everything is okay.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.324
Look, it's your robe.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.044
Mother says I'll grow into it.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.920
She says you were a great leader
who died protecting me.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.440
Saving one of my eyes.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.524
Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.640
Father, I'm worried about Mother.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.088
With every day that goes by,
she drifts further away.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.247
She talks a lot about you, but...

20:59.360 --> 21:01.440
But I just don't know.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.251
I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.687
I don't know what's real anymore.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.120
I just wish you were here,

21:11.200 --> 21:15.680
so I could talk to you, see you,

21:15.760 --> 21:17.200
find out what I should do.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.880
Daddy, Daddy, she's here! Grandma is here!

21:19.960 --> 21:22.645
Now it's time for the final part.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.440
We have to help her
get back to the spirit world.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.205
But she just got here.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.522
Come on.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.931
Father? Hello?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.051
Anytime.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.725
Fine!

22:38.200 --> 22:40.123
I don't need you anyway.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.003
Kubo.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.240
I'm sorry.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.327
Kubo.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.726
Kubo.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.320
Little boy.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.560
What happened to your eye?

23:22.640 --> 23:25.928
Who are you? How do you know my name?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.320
We are your family, Kubo.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.880
Your mother's sisters.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.885
And we've been looking
for you for so long.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.842
It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.600
Face-to-face.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.406
Come, Kubo. Come to your aunties.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.600
No reason to be afraid, Kubo.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.682
We just need your other eye.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.124
Your grandfather admires it so.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.561
Help! Help!

24:27.160 --> 24:28.640
Somebody help!

24:28.720 --> 24:30.643
Help! Look out!

24:31.080 --> 24:32.570
Run!

24:56.920 --> 24:59.680
We're here, Kubo.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.001
Your family has come for you.

25:14.800 --> 25:15.881
Kubo.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.521
Mother.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.760
Kubo, you must find the armor.
It's your only chance.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.200
Remember this.

25:37.640 --> 25:42.168
Mother! Mother! No!

25:44.600 --> 25:45.601
Mother!

25:59.400 --> 26:00.811
Kubo.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.481
Kubo!

26:05.480 --> 26:07.960
Can you hear me, Kubo?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.800
I said your mother is gone.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.850
Your village is destroyed.
Burned to the ground.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.002
We landed here in the Far Lands.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.930
Your enemies aren't far behind.

26:23.600 --> 26:27.002
We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.042
We need to go now.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.002
Come on, get up, let's go.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.680
Once we're inside,

27:17.760 --> 27:21.162
you might be tempted
to complain about the odor.

27:25.440 --> 27:30.405
Keep in mind my sense of smell
is 10 times stronger than yours.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.009
You have questions, I can tell.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.965
- Who...
- You get three.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.569
I think I have more.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.247
Three, but first you're gonna eat.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.250
Why only three?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.560
- Okay, that was your first question.
- What?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.051
I don't understand what's happening!

28:23.560 --> 28:24.971
Who are you?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.724
You don't recognize me?

28:31.640 --> 28:34.325
All these years, you had
to keep me in your pack.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.640
Well, now you know why.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
But you were a wooden charm.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.600
You were this big.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.763
I called that charm "Mr. Monkey."

28:43.960 --> 28:46.720
And if I were alive at that point,
I might have found that insulting.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.560
Look, your mother used the last
of her magic to save you

28:50.640 --> 28:52.210
and bring me to life.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.605
Here. Drink.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.160
- It smells.
- Everything in here smells.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.560
- Drink it.
- I don't want it.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.847
I said drink it.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.760
You're a mean monkey, aren't you?

29:17.840 --> 29:20.320
Yes. Yes, I am. And that's three.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.323
You're out of questions now,
so just listen.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.320
I'm here to protect you, Kubo.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.760
And that means you have to do as I say.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.200
So, if you don't eat, you'll be weak.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.880
If you're weak, you'll be slow.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.644
If you're slow, you'll die.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.531
It's too hot!

29:45.920 --> 29:46.921
Drink.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.970
Oh, excuse me.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.080
Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, Kubo.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.606
This is real. This is not a story.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.640
Those things, your aunts,
they never get hungry.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.840
They never sleep.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.410
They will find you!

30:24.560 --> 30:26.920
And if we're not prepared,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.243
they'll kill me and take your other eye.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.606
What are we gonna do?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.280
We're going to find the armor.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.727
It's the only thing that can protect you.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.083
So it's real. Really real.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.007
Don't worry. I'm not going to keep it.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.689
I pulled that from her head.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.721
I didn't mean to.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.560
Your mother was very powerful.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.005
She blessed your robes

31:09.160 --> 31:12.528
so that when the need was most,
they would fly you away.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.803
She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.480
This bracelet, her hair, it's a memory.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.086
And memories are powerful things, Kubo.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.766
Never lose it.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.961
One more question?

31:30.800 --> 31:31.960
Last one.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.485
Do you know where it is?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.166
The armor?

31:35.800 --> 31:38.326
No. No, I don't.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.649
Now, go to sleep.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.490
Goodnight, Monkey.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.201
Kubo.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.120
Kubo.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.929
You were talking in your sleep.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.120
You were dreaming,
calling out to your father,

32:22.200 --> 32:27.241
and then the paper flew out of your
bag and folded itself into him.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.040
He's been standing there
for hours, quietly judging us.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.965
I'm not even convinced
this counts as origami.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.046
I could swear scissors were involved.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.721
Ow.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.280
Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,

32:52.360 --> 32:56.001
and the paper always unfolded
itself by morning.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.690
What's that about?

33:22.120 --> 33:23.645
What are you doing?

33:29.080 --> 33:32.323
I guess this is how my father answered me.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.920
I'm tempted to say
that entrusting our fate

33:35.000 --> 33:38.440
to the guidance of a small paper man

33:38.520 --> 33:39.965
seems like a bad idea.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.564
But it's the best bad idea we have.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.410
You're growing stronger.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.887
You might not wanna look
quite so pleased about that.

35:18.520 --> 35:22.047
We grow stronger,
the world grows more dangerous.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.488
Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.002
Monkey, do you ever say
anything encouraging?

35:29.360 --> 35:31.362
I encourage you not to die.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.402
"I encourage you not to die."

36:02.560 --> 36:05.131
Mosquitoes. Annoying.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.170
Wasn't me, I swear.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.080
Paper runs out, as does patience.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.730
I didn't ask them to do that.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.965
The second time.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.480
I didn't! At least, not exactly.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.160
I mean, I felt it, but...

36:45.240 --> 36:47.200
Magic is not meant to be easy.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.960
You need to learn control.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.647
Concentrate on what you're doing,
and always remember,

36:52.800 --> 36:55.121
don't mess with the monkey.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.770
Tread carefully, Kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.320
How do you know? Maybe it is.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.920
And I'm the valiant hero
and you're the mean monkey.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.400
Heroes come and go.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.768
Any moment, something terrible
could come out of nowhere and...

37:25.800 --> 37:27.040
Monkey!

37:27.120 --> 37:28.406
Kubo!

37:41.240 --> 37:42.810
Monkey, wait.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.848
He wasn't trying to hurt me.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.051
He just wanted...

37:48.160 --> 37:49.525
- Hanzo.
- Hanzo?

37:51.280 --> 37:52.281
Hanzo.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.200
I still think I'm gonna stab him.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.520
Why must you always assume the worst?

38:01.600 --> 38:05.080
Oh! Oh! Pardon me for not trusting
this giant, spiky, insect-monster

38:05.160 --> 38:06.280
that just kidnapped you.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.120
Hanzo. Yes, I remember him.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.771
I think, maybe, he was my master.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.725
What? What did you say?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.445
We had a crest. A samurai crest.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.242
Have you seen this crest before?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.280
This is a miracle.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.000
You have our robes.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.924
You're wearing our robes!

38:39.600 --> 38:41.200
Why are you wearing our robes?

38:41.280 --> 38:42.640
He doesn't have to answer your questions.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.085
Anyway, who are you?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.521
Many years ago, I was cursed.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.925
Trapped in this cursed state.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.840
Cursed to wander the Far Lands.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.287
Cursed or curs-ed.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.760
No comrades, no master.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.411
Not even a name or a single memory

39:05.040 --> 39:07.720
of the noble warrior I once was.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.960
You used to be a man?

39:10.040 --> 39:11.610
No, not just any man.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.125
A samurai.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.762
I mean, I'm pretty certain.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.520
Look, I had the stuff.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.040
I mean, I'm either a samurai
or a really bad hoarder.

39:20.120 --> 39:24.205
Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.

39:24.440 --> 39:28.286
If you have no memory,
how can you be certain of anything?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.489
Because I get flashes.

39:30.840 --> 39:35.129
They come about from objects
I find on my travels.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.530
Sometimes it's a sound.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.285
Or a smell.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.400
You must get a lot of flashes.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.360
The memories, they fade.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.329
And all I'm left with
is the sense that I was

39:46.960 --> 39:49.611
once part of something much greater.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.480
Monkey, can I tell him?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.000
I really don't think that's a good idea.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.969
- He has a right.
- Absolutely not.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.680
- But... I...
- No "buts." No!

39:56.760 --> 39:58.720
- What? Tell me what?
- Hanzo was my father.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.484
Kubo!

40:00.680 --> 40:01.806
This is a miracle.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.804
I have found the son of my master.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.043
- Don't even.
- Oh.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.280
Whatever brings you to these lands,
whatever your quest,

40:13.360 --> 40:15.442
it is now my quest, too.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.120
I will join you, and I will give
my life for you, if necessary.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.929
Wow. You will?

40:22.640 --> 40:25.200
What? Do you think that's possible?

40:25.280 --> 40:28.600
Look, kid, I mean, I know how these
quests go. People die all the time.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.160
They drop like flies. That doesn't matter.

40:31.320 --> 40:35.560
'Cause I have a feeling
this is my destiny.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.080
No, it isn't!

40:37.160 --> 40:38.969
We can't trust anything you say,

40:39.080 --> 40:41.560
because you can't trust anything you say.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.160
We don't know anything about you.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.040
Monkey, you said it yourself.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.440
Our quest is a difficult one.

40:49.520 --> 40:54.606
A samurai, even a cursed one
with no memory, that looks like a bug,

40:54.880 --> 40:55.880
could be helpful.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.760
Yes, I am certain I could be helpful.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.800
Indispensable.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.564
In what way?

41:09.840 --> 41:13.322
Firing an arrow into a wall
is hardly what I call...

41:16.760 --> 41:17.920
Impressive.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.967
Oh, look at that.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.640
Literally, the first time
I've ever done it.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.404
Just tell me of our quest,

41:22.600 --> 41:26.764
and I will quickly demonstrate
my numerous indispensabilities.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.720
Well, that's kind of a long story.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.641
You've got my attention.
I promise I won't even blink.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.649
I actually don't think I even can blink.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.320
- Do I have eyelids?
- Fine.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.801
Walk and talk. Hanzo has found a path.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.080
So, you used to be a toy monkey.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.482
Kubo, I really don't see
how this part is important to our story.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.560
I kept her in my pocket.
She was only like this big.

42:11.640 --> 42:12.880
- Okay, Kubo, that's enough.
- Tiny.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.689
And she was called "Mr. Monkey."

42:14.800 --> 42:17.480
I wasn't a toy. I was a charm.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.801
Of course you were.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.006
That doesn't look good.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.810
Don't touch anything.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.606
He did it.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.560
Okay.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.040
No. No. No.

43:31.840 --> 43:32.887
Yes.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.804
Kubo, look.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.723
The sword unbreakable.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.600
It could be a trap.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.560
Allow me.

43:49.640 --> 43:52.040
What, it's not a trap if you do it?

43:52.120 --> 43:54.646
Stealth is my middle name.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.480
You don't even have a first name.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.369
Don't worry. I got this.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.320
The mighty Beetle is victorious!

44:39.400 --> 44:40.400
I don't got this.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.480
I don't got this!

44:41.560 --> 44:43.050
Oh, for crying out loud!

44:43.440 --> 44:46.284
I invoke the sword unbreakable!

44:48.600 --> 44:49.720
It broke.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.770
So, does it just mean the handle or...

44:53.200 --> 44:55.480
I'm a little disappointed
with this magic sword.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.767
It's not the right sword, you idiot!

45:03.480 --> 45:04.481
Look!

45:05.640 --> 45:08.120
The sword! It's in his head.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.640
Hey! I've got a bone to pick with you.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.720
See, because he's made of bones.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.290
You're an embarrassment.

45:17.920 --> 45:18.967
Uh...

45:19.360 --> 45:20.720
This is problematic.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.485
Enough with the arrows!

46:05.280 --> 46:06.280
Oh, foot!

46:10.360 --> 46:11.400
You can fly?

46:11.480 --> 46:13.040
Apparently, yes!

46:39.040 --> 46:41.646
Are you sure it isn't
the sword unfindable?

46:46.680 --> 46:47.681
I think I found it!

46:50.760 --> 46:53.366
A hand here. Anyone?

46:54.080 --> 46:55.605
Anyone else?

46:59.840 --> 47:00.966
Kubo!

47:14.560 --> 47:16.881
- Kubo!
- Monkey!

47:18.280 --> 47:19.361
Whoa!

47:19.480 --> 47:20.606
- No!
- Kubo!

47:24.080 --> 47:25.206
Huh.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.841
Yes!

47:40.000 --> 47:41.365
Thank goodness that's over.

47:57.720 --> 48:01.160
Everything turning black.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.083
Then open your eyes.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.481
Oh.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.120
I can't feel my wings.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.600
You didn't even know
you had them five minutes ago.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.840
Stop wriggling.

48:10.920 --> 48:11.921
Here.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.087
Is that feeling better?

48:13.200 --> 48:14.645
Oh, yeah. A little to the left.

48:14.800 --> 48:17.200
Down, just a bit.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.280
Right there. That's good.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.360
Wait, you're being nice to me.

48:22.440 --> 48:24.040
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.246
We did it, Beetle.

48:25.480 --> 48:26.766
We got the sword.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.928
Whoa. Put that down, it's sharp!

48:41.680 --> 48:43.240
Ooh. Mmm.

48:43.320 --> 48:47.245
Okay, we're done here. Get up.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.720
We have a lot of walking to do.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.961
You can't be serious.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.084
I'm always serious.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.920
Are you two going to fight, again?

48:55.000 --> 48:57.480
Of course not.
We're having a grown-up conversation.

48:57.560 --> 48:58.680
You're going to fight again.

48:58.760 --> 49:01.040
Kubo, just go over there
and play with something.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.720
Not that!

49:02.800 --> 49:06.160
Monkey, this is the Long Lake.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.400
We can't walk around it.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.686
We need to swim across.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.880
I can carry Kubo.

49:11.960 --> 49:14.480
"Carry Kubo." That's your better idea?

49:14.560 --> 49:16.960
Look, I appreciate your help. I really do.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.640
But when it comes to the boy,

49:18.720 --> 49:20.040
- I know what's best.
- Oh, is that right?

49:20.120 --> 49:23.960
And what's best is not to be
fielding ideas from a talking cockroach.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.720
This coming from a talking monkey.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.480
I can still hear you, you know.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.244
Then play louder.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.960
This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.800
Not to worry. Monkey see, monkey do.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.520
How long have you been
waiting to say that?

49:36.600 --> 49:38.125
Ever since I met you.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.408
Hey, what were we grown-up
conversation-ing about?

49:40.800 --> 49:43.520
You're ridiculous.
You're just absolutely ridiculous.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.600
Ridiculous!

49:44.680 --> 49:47.880
Crossing the lake is a ridiculous idea.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.200
It's not your fault.
There's no sense left in your head.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.360
I think I resent that.

49:52.440 --> 49:54.520
I may not know everything...

49:54.600 --> 49:56.040
- Anything.
- Anything.

49:56.120 --> 49:59.200
But I do know Kubo is more
capable than you think he is.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.320
You're being a tiny
bit overprotective here.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.160
I'm being a lot overprotective here.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.880
It's my job to make sure Kubo
is safe, and that is not safe.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.040
You... You are not safe.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.840
Kubo is just a child.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.760
And an incredibly gifted one.
He just saved our lives.

50:14.840 --> 50:20.200
Yes, he's very powerful,
but he still has much to learn!

50:20.280 --> 50:21.691
What?

50:25.960 --> 50:27.610
Well, fast learner.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.120
Did you know you could do that?

50:43.200 --> 50:44.440
Show off.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.164
Okay, now take a deep breath.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.080
Clear your mind.

51:12.160 --> 51:14.240
Guess I got that part covered.

51:14.320 --> 51:18.200
Now, draw back slowly. That's it.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.807
Close one eye.
Guess you got that part covered.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.640
Concentrate on what is directly
in front of you.

51:25.720 --> 51:28.200
Let everything else fall away.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.329
And release!

51:32.120 --> 51:33.720
Yeah!

51:33.800 --> 51:36.201
Perfect shot!

51:36.320 --> 51:37.560
Not bad.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.840
And what's your plan for getting
the fish into the boat,

51:39.920 --> 51:41.365
so we can actually eat it?

51:45.920 --> 51:50.040
Well, I said I was teaching him
how to shoot, not fish.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.521
Fishing is tomorrow's lesson.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.291
- Give me that.
- Whoa.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.886
Grabby monkey.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.286
Now try it.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.201
Pull back and...

52:06.880 --> 52:08.041
Whoo-hoo!

52:08.800 --> 52:10.320
A rope.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.640
It's a pretty good idea.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.927
Hmm. And you're not an awful shot.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.481
Okay, now you two are being weird.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.600
Um...

52:22.680 --> 52:25.160
We're going to need
something to cut this with.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.404
Sword unbreakable.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.448
Must you play with your food?

53:00.040 --> 53:01.280
Yes.

53:05.600 --> 53:06.806
What's the matter, Kubo?

53:07.120 --> 53:09.400
You act like you've never had a meal

53:09.480 --> 53:11.687
sitting between a monkey
and a beetle before.

53:12.800 --> 53:16.000
I've never had a meal sitting
between anyone before.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.480
Come on, eat. You need energy.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.600
And this is much better than whale soup.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.126
Kubo, question.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.764
Before you started on your heroic
quest, what were you like?

53:28.840 --> 53:32.240
Well, I looked after my mother mostly.

53:32.320 --> 53:36.760
And I told stories about mighty
warriors seeking revenge

53:36.840 --> 53:40.208
with battles, and monsters, and magic.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.163
I was pretty good at telling them.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.645
Not so good at ending them.

53:45.520 --> 53:49.400
Sometimes I would tell my mother
stories about little things.

53:49.480 --> 53:52.240
Like skimming rocks across the river

53:52.320 --> 53:55.560
or catching fireflies
in the mulberry fields.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.766
And when I told those stories,
I could see her eyes were mostly clear.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.049
I could tell she saw me.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.289
Really saw me.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.880
I could see her, too.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.360
Her real self.

54:08.440 --> 54:12.240
Her spirit trying to fight its way out.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.091
It was beautiful.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.171
You know something, Kubo?

54:21.600 --> 54:26.241
Back when you just told stories,
before you went on this great adventure,

54:26.480 --> 54:28.847
you were still very much a hero.

54:49.040 --> 54:50.680
We're gonna have to head for shore.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.808
Find a hiding place and...

55:00.960 --> 55:02.720
The second piece of armor.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.040
The breastplate.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.168
It's down there?

55:06.280 --> 55:07.520
Okay, I got it.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.600
- Beetle, wait!
- No, don't worry.

55:09.680 --> 55:13.320
Beetles can hold their breath
under water for a very long time.

55:13.400 --> 55:14.480
What? Since when?

55:14.560 --> 55:16.160
It's a well-known fact, Monkey.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.800
So, you don't remember anything
at all, but beetles swimming?

55:18.880 --> 55:20.320
That's what sticks in there?

55:20.400 --> 55:21.360
No, Beetle.

55:21.440 --> 55:24.320
My mother told me
a story about the Long Lake.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.160
There's something under the water.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.241
Oh, yeah?

55:27.480 --> 55:28.845
Um...

55:29.160 --> 55:31.000
What kind of something?

55:31.080 --> 55:33.160
She said there was a garden of eyes,

55:33.240 --> 55:36.680
eyes that stare into you, into your soul.

55:36.760 --> 55:40.924
They show you secrets, things
to keep you down there with them.

55:41.600 --> 55:42.647
Forever.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.885
Okay.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.240
Well, I won't look
directly into anyone's eyes,

55:48.320 --> 55:50.607
even if I'm being incredibly sincere.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.520
You're gonna miss me, Monkey.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.481
Be careful.

56:31.520 --> 56:35.840
He's searching for the armor
just like his insolent father.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.640
Yes, sister.

56:37.720 --> 56:42.169
Then we must ensure he
does not find what remains.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.802
Monkey, I think he's in trouble!

56:56.480 --> 56:57.680
We should help him.

56:57.760 --> 57:00.760
Kubo, your aunts are still out there.
I'm sorry.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.002
But we have to head for shore.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.121
Kubo!

57:11.520 --> 57:12.520
Kubo.

57:14.920 --> 57:16.285
Look at this.

57:16.640 --> 57:21.282
I come fishing and all I reel in
is a stinking ape.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.080
How pathetic that this filthy creature

57:25.160 --> 57:27.481
is all that's left of my sister's magic.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.162
This filthy creature will tear you apart!

58:06.560 --> 58:08.050
Kubo.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.081
Kubo?

58:27.280 --> 58:31.729
I have crushed creatures who could
fit this world on their fingernail.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.402
This victory brings me no honor.

58:38.240 --> 58:41.210
Imagine how you're going
to feel when you lose.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.402
I felt loss only once.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.965
Eleven years ago, I lost my sister.

58:52.240 --> 58:55.926
She fell in love with a fool
and betrayed our father!

58:58.800 --> 59:00.802
She was an ungrateful coward!

59:11.880 --> 59:13.928
Who's the coward now?

59:26.480 --> 59:28.448
I got it! I got it!

59:30.760 --> 59:34.082
Beetle, what happened? Where's Kubo?

59:34.320 --> 59:35.890
Um...

59:42.960 --> 59:44.166
Uh-oh.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.646
Get back down there! He's in trouble!

59:57.160 --> 59:58.969
I got it.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.330
Mother. Mother.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.280
Mother. Mother.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.250
Mother.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.000
It never fails to amaze me

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.720
how the creatures down here fight
so hard just to die another day.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.724
Down here, there are
days worth fighting for.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.249
There is nothing down here worth anything!

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.240
It's pathetic what happened to my sister.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.244
I looked up to her. She was so strong.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.640
And love made her weak.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720
No!

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.611
It made me stronger.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.881
Over here.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.965
The eyes...

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.966
It was the eyes.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.285
They had him in a trance.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.040
Oh, no.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.560
No.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.160
Come on. Come on, Kubo.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.403
Wake up. Please wake up!

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.604
Please, please wake up.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.130
It's gonna be all right.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.604
It's gonna be all right.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.281
I'm here.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.845
I'm right here.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.321
I saw...

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.444
What? What did you see?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.001
I saw...

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.487
Mother.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.726
My son.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.444
So, you must look
more like your dad, then?

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.771
You're staring.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.480
Let me guess. You have questions.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.960
- Why...
- I'll start.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.680
First question.
If I'm Beetle and you're Monkey,

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.364
why isn't he called "Boy"?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.721
Oh, boy.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.929
Questions can wait.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.640
We need sleep.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.724
Tell us your story, then we can sleep.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.641
Please?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.087
Okay.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.250
Perhaps you can help me.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.601
The night I met your father...

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.966
Mother.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.005
My sisters and I went to the Temple
of Bones to kill Hanzo.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.566
Oh, right.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.240
At the bidding of the Moon King,

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.120
my sisters and I had
come down from the night sky

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.407
and killed many noble warriors.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.360
Your grandfather told us

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.125
that any man who found the magical armor

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.883
would grow too powerful
and be a threat to the heavens.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.206
That night, I arrived
at the temple before my sisters.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.481
And there he was, the mighty Hanzo.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.331
"You have offended my father," I told him.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.480
"Now you must die."

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.960
Yeah, that's so you.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.883
Beetle. Shh!

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.125
We fought.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.805
Hanzo was strong.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.331
But then he stopped.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.442
He looked into my eyes
and uttered four simple words.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.768
These words changed everything.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.281
"I love you,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.405
"Monkey"?

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.880
"You are my quest,"

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.200
he whispered.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.080
I had seen the wonders of the universe,

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.006
but the warmth of his gaze
as I looked into his eyes...

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.686
That... That I had never known.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.280
It was his humanity I saw.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.203
And it was more powerful
than anything in my cold realm.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.530
In recognizing his compassion,
I recognized my own.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.890
I spared his life.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.050
He gave me mine.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.925
And... And then he gave me you.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.123
But your grandfather found us.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.641
His rage at my betrayal shook the heavens.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.560
Your father and his army gave their lives,

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.405
allowing me to escape with you in my arms.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.605
Why does Grandfather hate me?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.686
Oh, Kubo...

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.530
He doesn't hate you.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.240
He wants to make you just like him.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.004
Blind to humanity,

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.004
as I once was.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.484
Only then can you take your place
beside him as part of his family.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.128
Cold and hard.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.051
And perfect.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.966
I'll never be like him, never.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.160
I know.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.560
He's exhausted.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.641
Mmm.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640
Me, too.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.449
I'm not tucking you in.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.041
You're hurt.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.125
It's just a scratch.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.924
Monkey, why didn't you tell him
sooner who you really are?

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.129
The magic that keeps me here, it's fading.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.970
Soon I'll be gone.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.240
And then Kubo will be alone again.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.481
Not alone.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.280
He is the son of Hanzo.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.807
I will do everything I can
to keep him from harm.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.284
Thank you, Beetle.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:55.482
To know Kubo has someone
to watch over him when I'm gone.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.845
That would be a fine way to end my story.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.322
Your story will never end.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.160
It will be told by him
and by the people he shares it with.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.368
And by the people they share it with.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.319
And by the people they share it with,
and by the people they share it with.

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.050
- And by the people...
- Beetle.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:23.008
The point is your story will live on

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.001
in him.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.924
Hello, my young friend.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.682
Why don't you join in my song?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.926
But how did you...

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.600
- You're...
- Even blinder than you?

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.120
Twice as much, to be precise.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.729
Which means I see double the truth.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.285
This is all a dream.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.203
Is this a good dream or a bad one?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.203
See for yourself.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.840
My father's fortress.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.921
Yes.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.770
The last piece of the armor.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.286
It's here?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.129
Follow the setting sun and you'll find it,

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.603
in the place that
might have been your home.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.205
Claim your birthright, Kubo.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.409
Give this story a happy ending.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.720
Mother! Beetle! Wake up!

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.520
I'm up. I'm up.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.648
Well, I'm down.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.087
Off.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.209
I think I slept on something.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.484
Sword uncomfortable.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.880
The helmet, I know where it is.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.644
I saw it in a dream, Beetle.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.491
A dream?

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.720
Well, it doesn't mean
anything in particular.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.805
I mean, I dreamed I fought a giant
skeleton with swords in its head.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.240
That really happened.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.560
Oh, yeah.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.240
Beetle.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.243
Come on, this way.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.365
I spy with my one eye
something beginning with "S."

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.371
- Snow?
- No.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.361
Snowflake?

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.290
- No.
- Okay.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.120
Oh. Pfft.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.320
Snow covered trees.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.289
Nothing to do with snow.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.963
How about "serious"?

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.166
Stupid.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.520
Okay, I got it.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.800
Snow.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.565
He said it wasn't "snow."

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.320
It's a song.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.840
Well, that's not fair.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.280
How do you see a song?

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.361
You look.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.405
Golden heron.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.080
It's believed they hold
the souls of the departed,

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.561
carrying them over
to wherever they need to go.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.401
Hmm.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.730
What are they singing?

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.331
It's beautiful.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.927
Many say the song's about
what happens when we die.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.123
How we don't just disappear.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.680
We don't?

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.206
Uh, so, what happens to us?

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.680
Well, like Kubo's paper, we shift.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.566
We transform so we can continue
our story to another place.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.085
The end of one story is merely
the beginning of another.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.969
I remember this place.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.330
This was where my father
prepared for his quest.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.960
There's something I don't understand.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.849
Why would the helmet be here?

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.886
Kubo!

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.160
Release us!

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.570
Oh, sister.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.402
I remember how we looked up to you.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.206
Of all of us, you shone the brightest.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.485
Such a waste.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.489
All we ever wished was to be
a family in our home among the stars.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.080
I think we have very different
definitions of family.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.200
Don't you touch him, you witch!

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.680
And then there's you,

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.200
the thieving insect
who stole my sister's soul.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.281
What?

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.123
Oh, this is precious.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.527
You've been together all this time
and you haven't even realized?

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120
You took her from us.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.965
It was only fitting
we took something from you.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.320
How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.720
wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.040
Hanzo.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.721
What?

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.801
Hanzo?

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.489
I... I didn't know.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.170
No!

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.643
I'm forgetting what I came here for.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.446
Mother!

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.768
Shh. It's okay. I'm here.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.766
Father?

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.801
My son.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.248
Seems I'm married to a bug.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.326
Yeah.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.885
But a samurai bug.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.642
You are my quest.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.410
You always have been.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.889
Hanzo, keep him safe, no matter what.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.210
I promise I will.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.807
No!

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.522
Fly home, Kubo.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.202
Kubo? Is that you?

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.960
You have to leave this place.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.486
The Moon King, he's coming.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.720
Grandfather!

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.050
It's me, Kubo!

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.809
I know you can see me!

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.482
Hello, grandson.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.567
It's so good to see you at last.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.650
So to speak.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.363
And I see you found the armor.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.440
Seems your mother had a reason

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.205
to bring you to this
dreadful place after all.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.326
I see.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.526
I know you do.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.288
That's how this all began.
You finally saw me.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.482
It was my fault.
I should've listened to my parents.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.680
Kubo, we both want the exact same thing.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.843
You want to take my other eye.
That's what you want!

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.408
Well, yes. But do you know why I want it?

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:35.080
Because you're old, and mean, and cruel.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.800
Oh, now, that's a little harsh.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.040
As long as you cling
to that silly, useless eye,

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.044
you can't come up to live with me.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.324
In the heavens.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.640
You'll be stuck down here in this hell,

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.320
staring with that lonely eye
at hate and heartache

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.485
and suffering and death.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.091
Where I want to take you,

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.480
we have none of those things.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.848
It'll just be you with your family.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.760
Where you belong.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.000
My family is gone.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.680
- You killed them.
- No...

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.360
They brought their fates upon themselves!

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:29.600
They disgraced me and upset
the order of everything!

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.762
That's how your story goes.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.085
Oh, Kubo...

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.240
When you're up there with me,
you will be beyond stories.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.769
You will be immortal.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.929
You will be

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.929
infinite.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.280
No. You're wrong, not infinite.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.601
All stories have an end.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.128
Is that right?

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.123
And how does this story end?

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.680
I kill you.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.761
Oh.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.880
Very well. Is this your wish,

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.360
to do battle with a hideous monster
who ruined your life,

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.162
to prove your worth
like your doomed father?

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.489
How mortal.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.211
You want to be human?

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.280
Then share their weakness!

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.722
Suffer their humiliation!

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.562
Feel their pain!

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:47.205
This is the end of your story.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.960
Now, take one last
look with that lonely eye,

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:58.571
one last look at this wretched
place you call home.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.849
I'm not leaving.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.402
For every horrible thing down here,
there's something far more beautiful.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.680
My mother saw it.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.161
So did my father. I see it.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.249
Even with just one eye.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.644
Then I'll just have to
rip it out of your head again,

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.160
won't I?

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.691
If you must blink, do it now.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.968
I know why you want my eye.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.328
Because without it, I can't look into
the eyes of another and see their soul.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.247
- Their love...
- Everything you loved is gone!

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.480
Everything you knew
has been taken from you!

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.760
No.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.280
It's in my memories.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.761
The most powerful kind of magic there is.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.565
It makes us stronger than you'll ever be.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.491
These are the memories
of those we have loved and lost.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.203
And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts,

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.644
then you will never
take them away from us.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.362
And that really is the least of it.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.960
Where am I?

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.202
Hello, Grandfather.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.966
Oh, hello.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.128
What happened to your eye?

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.931
Don't you remember?

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.167
No, I... I'm sorry, young man.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.446
But I seem to have forgotten my story.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.604
Can you help me?

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.000
I'll tell him.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.720
No, we'll all tell him.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.565
We'll tell him everything
he needs to know.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.600
You are the kindest, sweetest man

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.480
to ever live in this village.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.440
- Oh. Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.720
Uh... Uh...

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.880
Every day, you walk around smiling
and handing out coins to children.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.040
Like me!

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.840
And old women.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:43.920
Oh.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.560
You... You taught my kids to swim.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.680
What?

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.960
And you give blankets to the poor.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.007
You're a good man.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.640
- You fed the hungry.
- You always lend a helping hand.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.920
You're a great example.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.440
It turns out I'm pretty selfless.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.160
That's why we love you.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.240
You know, we have something in common.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.527
We both adore your grandson.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.207
His name is Kubo.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.930
Kubo?

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.010
I'm sorry.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.890
But I... But I don't remember.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.761
Well...

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.840
Your grandson's a storyteller.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.684
He'll tell you all the stories
you've forgotten.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.326
Really?

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.125
Of course.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.881
Hello, Mother.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:08.881
Father.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:15.280
I know my stories can tend
to get a little, um, long,

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.886
so I'll keep this brief.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.203
I'm very grateful I've had
the chance to meet you both,

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.208
hear your wisdom, feel your kindness,

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.487
even eat a meal sitting between you.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.569
This was a happy story.

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.240
But it could still be a whole lot happier.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:42.840
I don't know exactly what the rules are

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:47.528
or how this works,
but if there were any way to...

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.842
You know, I still need you.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:57.725
So I can say this has been
a happy story, or I could feel it.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.923
We could all feel it.

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.723
Then we could end this story.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.240
Together.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.401
The end.
