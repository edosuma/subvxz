Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:15.808 --> 01:18.809
So my question to you is,

01:18.811 --> 01:22.178
why didn't you shoot her
from a distance?

01:22.180 --> 01:24.281
You got a nice scope
on that rifle.

01:24.283 --> 01:28.585
You could have climbed up
those hills behind her house

01:28.587 --> 01:30.154
and shot her
in the front yard

01:30.156 --> 01:32.255
and said it was
a hunting accident,

01:32.257 --> 01:34.791
and no one would have
suspected anything,

01:34.793 --> 01:37.226
because no one knew
there was anything going on

01:37.228 --> 01:39.331
between you two, right?

01:48.174 --> 01:50.110
Why did you kill her?

03:09.587 --> 03:11.287
Did you get my egg roll?

03:11.289 --> 03:12.691
Yeah.

03:17.663 --> 03:19.363
- Where's Amber?
- She's got a date.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.965
She said you'd be mad,
but I can watch Jody.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.204
I'm old enough.

03:44.556 --> 03:46.960
You're supposed to be watching
the kids tonight.

03:52.563 --> 03:53.864
Misty's 12.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.631
She can babysit
a six-year-old.

03:55.633 --> 03:59.004
They shouldn't be left alone
in the house at night.

04:03.675 --> 04:05.544
What is your problem?

04:08.781 --> 04:11.681
Admit it,
you just hate the idea

04:11.683 --> 04:13.816
that I have a life
and you don't.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.053
You're just mad
because you have to work.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.387
Well, you'd have to work
anyways, Harley.

04:18.389 --> 04:21.091
I fucking promise you,
you're not going to college

04:21.093 --> 04:23.659
or doing anything meaningful
with your life.

04:23.661 --> 04:25.529
Meaningful.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.764
Like fucking guys
in the back of pick-up trucks?

04:28.766 --> 04:32.538
You'd give anything
to fuck someone.

04:43.014 --> 04:44.613
Why aren't you eating?

04:44.615 --> 04:46.550
I'm making my list
of things to do.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.618
I don't like
hot dogs anyway.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.952
You always eat hot dogs.

04:49.954 --> 04:52.089
Not like that.
I like them long now.

04:52.091 --> 04:55.591
Esme says cut-up hot dogs
are the number one cause

04:55.593 --> 04:58.495
of choking deaths among children
in the United States.

04:58.497 --> 05:00.697
She told me
on the bus today.

05:00.699 --> 05:02.531
Live dangerously.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.800
- I won't eat it.
- You have to.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.034
I do not.

05:05.036 --> 05:07.774
Harley, tell her
she has to eat it.

05:09.007 --> 05:11.675
I don't care
if she eats it.

05:11.677 --> 05:12.875
I'll eat it if you fix it.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.411
And how am I going
to fix it?

05:14.413 --> 05:15.745
With glue.

05:15.747 --> 05:17.848
Eating glue would kill you.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.483
Then make me another one.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.551
- I don't want to.
- Make me another one.

05:22.553 --> 05:24.823
You can have my last one.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.493
There's mustard on it.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.026
Wipe it off.

05:31.028 --> 05:33.365
Fine.

05:35.867 --> 05:39.101
Do you want to hear
my fortune?

05:39.103 --> 05:41.471
I have to go to work.
Can you tell me tomorrow?

05:41.473 --> 05:43.475
No, you got to hear it now.

05:47.446 --> 05:51.014
"You are the master
of every situation."

05:51.016 --> 05:52.785
It's for you.

05:54.086 --> 05:56.422
Thank you.

06:44.502 --> 06:47.170
Hey, Harley.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.605
Hey.

06:48.607 --> 06:51.007
How are you?

06:51.009 --> 06:52.845
I'm okay.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.079
The girls?

06:56.081 --> 06:57.917
They're fine.

07:00.651 --> 07:02.586
Jody told Esme
that you won't let Amber

07:02.588 --> 07:04.753
get her driver's permit.

07:04.755 --> 07:06.822
She can get it
when she gets a job

07:06.824 --> 07:08.625
and she can pay
for her own insurance.

07:08.627 --> 07:09.925
Oh.

07:09.927 --> 07:11.795
It's, like,
a thousand bucks.

07:11.797 --> 07:13.663
You've really become
the full-fledged

07:13.665 --> 07:15.168
head of the household.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.605
Esme's been bugging me to have
Jody over for dinner again.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.109
I was thinking Monday.

07:24.576 --> 07:26.108
Monday's Jody's night to cook,

07:26.110 --> 07:29.178
but I guess we can all pour
our own bowls of cereal.

07:32.517 --> 07:35.017
This is nice.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.752
What do you mean?

07:36.754 --> 07:39.725
No kids.
I left them at home with Brad.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.060
This is nice,
shopping by myself.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.762
It's the most relaxing thing
I've done in weeks.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.666
It's kind of pathetic,

07:50.668 --> 07:52.836
coming to a grocery store
for fun.

07:52.838 --> 07:55.204
It's not as pathetic
as working in one.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.877
It's a lot more pathetic.

07:59.911 --> 08:01.978
I should finish up.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.880
Okay.

08:04.882 --> 08:07.082
Well, remember to send Jody
with a note on the bus

08:07.084 --> 08:10.019
so that she can get off
with Esme on Monday, okay?

08:10.021 --> 08:11.723
Okay.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.430
What the fuck?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.703
Harley, you fucking shit!

10:45.711 --> 10:48.080
I fucking hate you!

10:50.282 --> 10:52.415
Please, don't go.

10:52.417 --> 10:53.949
Go back to bed.

10:53.951 --> 10:56.087
Wait.

11:07.999 --> 11:10.967
Harley, listen to me!

11:10.969 --> 11:13.706
I fucking hate you,
Harley!

11:18.143 --> 11:20.443
I hate you.

11:20.445 --> 11:22.078
Get off me!

11:22.080 --> 11:23.816
Go over there!

12:31.950 --> 12:34.117
What's a lethal injection?

12:34.119 --> 12:35.884
Where'd you hear that?

12:35.886 --> 12:40.455
Tyler at school.
He says Mom's going to get one.

12:40.457 --> 12:42.858
Mom's not going to get one.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.228
Esme says it's what the vet
gives old dogs

12:45.230 --> 12:47.296
when they're having trouble
dying.

12:47.298 --> 12:50.098
She said people don't get them,
because they don't need them.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.004
They die on their own.

12:53.404 --> 12:54.871
She's right.

12:54.873 --> 12:56.605
Mom's not going to die, is she?

12:56.607 --> 12:58.273
No.

12:58.275 --> 13:01.009
I don't want her to die,
even if she killed Daddy.

13:01.011 --> 13:04.048
I can't talk about this shit
while I'm driving, okay?

13:10.621 --> 13:12.421
Do you want
to hear a joke?

13:12.423 --> 13:14.089
Sure.

13:14.091 --> 13:17.493
What does a vampire say
when you do him a favor?

13:17.495 --> 13:19.362
I don't know.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.030
"Fangs a lot."

13:59.004 --> 14:01.373
Mommy, I missed you.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.241
Harley, I thought...

14:05.243 --> 14:08.377
I thought I wouldn't
see you again.

14:08.379 --> 14:10.412
Oh, my baby.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.050
Hi.

14:18.155 --> 14:20.522
You look...

14:20.524 --> 14:22.360
different.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.268
Where do we keep
the extra light bulbs?

14:37.274 --> 14:40.008
I think they're in
the bathroom,

14:40.010 --> 14:44.149
under the sink,
to the right.

14:45.549 --> 14:47.385
Do we have any?

14:49.321 --> 14:51.353
Well, I don't know.
It's...

14:51.355 --> 14:53.388
it's been a long time.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.027
Mommy, look at the picture
I brought you.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.127
Is that your father's coat?

14:59.129 --> 15:03.031
He wears it all the time.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.069
Look at my picture.

15:07.404 --> 15:09.472
Yay. Yippee.

15:09.474 --> 15:11.911
That's so pretty.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.451
Where's Misty?

15:22.453 --> 15:24.152
She didn't want to come.

15:24.154 --> 15:26.723
Harley wouldn't
let her come.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.458
Why not?

15:28.460 --> 15:32.527
They fight in the truck
and it drives me crazy.

15:32.529 --> 15:35.333
Do you want to know
where Amber is?

15:36.768 --> 15:41.436
Amber's a big girl,
so she probably has plans.

15:41.438 --> 15:43.573
She's started dating.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.677
Define dating.

15:48.746 --> 15:52.650
Harley, what's wrong with you?

15:59.390 --> 16:01.656
You want to be here.

16:01.658 --> 16:04.594
That's ridiculous.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.462
No.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.097
You want to be here.

16:12.570 --> 16:15.007
Harley. Harley!

16:30.154 --> 16:32.387
If you don't trust Amber
to watch your sisters at night,

16:32.389 --> 16:34.623
what about someone else?
How about a relative?

16:34.625 --> 16:37.526
I told you before,
Mom doesn't have any family.

16:37.528 --> 16:39.829
And Dad's family won't have
anything to do with us.

16:39.831 --> 16:43.232
- Oh, why do you think that is?
- Because we're related to Mom.

16:43.234 --> 16:46.502
You're related
to your father too.

16:46.504 --> 16:48.606
Not as closely.

16:51.275 --> 16:53.408
What about Uncle Mike?

16:53.410 --> 16:55.780
I thought you said
he was helping out lately.

16:57.414 --> 17:01.184
He's been bringing me
cases of Pabst.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.820
I guess that's helpful.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.821
Cash would be more helpful,
in my opinion.

17:05.824 --> 17:09.291
Alcohol is not a solution
to your problems.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.359
I didn't say anything
about alcohol.

17:11.362 --> 17:13.265
I was talking about beer.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.736
Let's get back
to your mother.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.805
This was a big step for you.

17:22.807 --> 17:25.443
When do you think
you'll see her again?

17:30.882 --> 17:32.481
I don't know.

17:32.483 --> 17:35.319
You are planning
on seeing her again, aren't you?

17:44.394 --> 17:47.263
You made an interesting comment

17:47.265 --> 17:50.232
about your mother
being more concerned

17:50.234 --> 17:52.602
about the girls
than she is about you.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.773
Why do you think
that's true?

17:56.207 --> 17:58.673
Because they're girls.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.711
Why should that matter?

18:02.279 --> 18:04.680
Girls can get pregnant.

18:04.682 --> 18:08.217
A guy can walk away
from it.

18:08.219 --> 18:09.651
Hmm.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.453
What about you?

18:11.455 --> 18:12.721
What if you got
a girl pregnant?

18:12.723 --> 18:15.126
Would you just
walk away from it?

18:16.326 --> 18:18.363
I'd marry her.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.498
Interesting.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.267
Why?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.835
Because you answered
so quickly.

18:26.837 --> 18:28.773
What if you didn't
love the girl?

18:30.642 --> 18:32.440
I had sex with her, right?

18:32.442 --> 18:34.643
Yes.

18:34.645 --> 18:39.181
So you're saying you wouldn't
have sex with a girl

18:39.183 --> 18:41.119
unless you love her.

18:43.421 --> 18:46.758
If she would have sex with me,
then I would love her.

18:53.631 --> 18:57.499
What if a wife and child
would interfere

18:57.501 --> 19:00.305
with your future plans?

19:02.640 --> 19:04.539
If I got her pregnant,

19:04.541 --> 19:06.244
it would mean
I was being stupid.

19:07.878 --> 19:10.314
So, you'd marry her
out of responsibility?

19:12.517 --> 19:14.318
I guess so.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.286
You'd commit yourself
to another human being

19:18.288 --> 19:22.661
for the rest of your life
as a form of punishment.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.371
Did you like your father,
Harley?

19:33.938 --> 19:35.607
Did you respect him?

19:38.776 --> 19:41.776
He did everything
he was supposed to.

19:41.778 --> 19:44.950
Including beating his children?
Was he supposed to do that?

19:50.020 --> 19:51.988
He thought he was.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.959
Good.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.196
Why do you think that?

20:02.467 --> 20:04.770
I don't want to talk about him
anymore.

20:07.571 --> 20:10.305
I have to go.

20:10.307 --> 20:12.341
We haven't finished
your session yet.

20:12.343 --> 20:15.447
My apologies
to the taxpayers.

20:24.955 --> 20:26.657
Slow down, little man.

20:28.292 --> 20:30.058
- How are you?
- Okay.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.727
I was just on the phone
with Misty.

20:31.729 --> 20:33.528
I told her I'd drive Jody home
for you.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.564
That's okay.

20:35.566 --> 20:37.600
Well, have you had dinner?

20:37.602 --> 20:40.902
Yeah, I ate in town.

20:40.904 --> 20:42.971
Well, I have something
for you anyway.

20:42.973 --> 20:45.341
You want to come in
for a minute?

20:45.343 --> 20:46.776
In?

20:46.778 --> 20:48.576
In the house.

20:48.578 --> 20:50.348
Sure.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.688
Do me a favor, Harley.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.488
Have the last pork chop.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.458
Oh, that's okay.

21:02.460 --> 21:05.460
Big guy like you can't finish
off that little pork chop?

21:05.462 --> 21:07.830
What about your husband?

21:07.832 --> 21:10.402
He won't want it.
He's eating out tonight.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.405
Do you want a beer?

21:17.407 --> 21:18.909
Sure.

21:24.115 --> 21:26.484
You are old enough to drink,
right?

21:53.877 --> 21:56.411
- This is great.
- Thanks.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.616
Jody liked them too.

22:01.085 --> 22:03.451
Can we have
something to eat?

22:03.453 --> 22:05.453
Baby, you just had dinner. No.

22:05.455 --> 22:06.822
That's it, no more.

22:06.824 --> 22:08.690
Did you eat
these pork chops?

22:08.692 --> 22:10.860
I loved them.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.995
But you hate pork chops.

22:12.997 --> 22:16.164
I hate your pork chops.
They taste like napkins.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.901
It's probably just the marinade.
I'll give you the recipe.

22:18.903 --> 22:22.470
Esme Jane,
where are your shoes?

22:22.472 --> 22:23.905
- Outside.
- It's not summer yet.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.642
Go put them back on.
Right now. Go, go, go.

22:31.648 --> 22:33.815
Esme's kind of a weird name.

22:33.817 --> 22:36.885
Where'd you get it?

22:36.887 --> 22:38.853
It was the name of a model
and a mistress

22:38.855 --> 22:42.961
of one of my favorite artists,
a French Impressionist.

23:09.053 --> 23:11.754
He paints like
Pierre Bonnard.

23:11.756 --> 23:14.559
You know who
Pierre Bonnard is?

23:17.828 --> 23:19.828
Yeah.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.463
My mom had these note cards

23:21.465 --> 23:24.165
she got from
the Art Institute of Chicago.

23:24.167 --> 23:27.135
Had one of his paintings
on the front.

23:27.137 --> 23:29.872
Table Set in a Garden.

23:29.874 --> 23:31.974
So you're familiar
with his work.

23:31.976 --> 23:34.946
I'm familiar
with his note cards.

23:38.715 --> 23:40.684
I like Impressionists.

23:42.118 --> 23:45.153
They don't care about what
something really looks like.

23:45.155 --> 23:48.023
They only care about
how looking at something

23:48.025 --> 23:50.061
makes a person feel.

23:53.163 --> 23:55.800
It's the definition
of Impressionism.

24:11.582 --> 24:14.249
You're wearing my shirt.
I told you to stop doing that.

24:14.251 --> 24:15.854
Take it off.

24:21.558 --> 24:23.959
- What are you doing?
- You said take it off.

24:23.961 --> 24:27.932
Put it back on right now.
Put it back on right now.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.841
There you go.

24:44.248 --> 24:47.751
A purple one.
I needed another purple one.

24:50.221 --> 24:52.020
You're late tonight.

24:52.022 --> 24:54.323
I was hoping
you finally decided to split,

24:54.325 --> 24:56.292
and then I could
get my license.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.892
You're so stupid, Amber.

24:57.894 --> 24:59.260
You just don't get it,
do you?

24:59.262 --> 25:01.697
- What don't I get?
- I can't afford it.

25:01.699 --> 25:04.732
Which word don't you
understand?

25:04.734 --> 25:06.768
I understand all of them.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.304
I don't make enough money

25:08.306 --> 25:12.074
to come up with an extra
thousand bucks so you can drive.

25:12.076 --> 25:13.776
How did Daddy do it?

25:13.778 --> 25:15.744
Dad made good money.

25:15.746 --> 25:17.779
- Driving a cement mixer?
- Yeah.

25:17.781 --> 25:19.981
So why you can't you drive
a cement mixer?

25:19.983 --> 25:23.218
I can drive
a cement mixer.

25:23.220 --> 25:26.156
I just can't get a job
driving a cement mixer.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.234
Did you lose another tooth?

25:39.236 --> 25:40.672
Yeah.

25:44.608 --> 25:47.176
I suppose you can't afford
a quarter.

25:47.178 --> 25:50.245
Harley doesn't pay for my teeth.
The tooth fairy does.

25:50.247 --> 25:52.815
Except I don't understand
why the tooth fairy

25:52.817 --> 25:55.252
only gives me a quarter
and gives Esme a dollar.

25:57.253 --> 25:59.354
Esme's mom brought you
a present.

26:00.891 --> 26:02.891
I wouldn't call it
a present.

26:02.893 --> 26:04.692
What are you talking about?

26:04.694 --> 26:06.894
Well, she stopped by
this afternoon

26:06.896 --> 26:10.164
and she brought you
some recipes and an art book.

26:10.166 --> 26:12.167
Are you turning into a fag
or something?

26:12.169 --> 26:14.068
What's a fag?

26:14.070 --> 26:16.138
I mean, I guess you
might as well be a faggot,

26:16.140 --> 26:18.176
because you can't get a girl
to make it with you.

26:20.277 --> 26:23.144
- What book?
- A giant book.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.014
It's a book from
the Art Institute of Chicago.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.349
Miss Mercer put a Post-it
on the front of it

26:27.351 --> 26:30.251
with all of the pages of photos
she thought you might like.

26:30.253 --> 26:32.955
It's too weird
and gross, okay?

26:32.957 --> 26:34.856
That woman needs
to get a life.

26:34.858 --> 26:37.892
You should have seen what she
was wearing for someone her age.

26:37.894 --> 26:40.194
What was she wearing?

26:40.196 --> 26:42.398
Pink denim shorts

26:42.400 --> 26:44.333
that were way too fucking tight
for her.

26:44.335 --> 26:45.901
You are so jealous of her

26:45.903 --> 26:48.036
because she has the exact shorts
you want.

26:48.038 --> 26:49.371
Shut up.

26:49.373 --> 26:51.206
Women like that
are pathetic.

26:51.208 --> 26:53.676
They think men want to look
at them after they hit 30.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.178
I can't wait to see you
in your 30s.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.447
Oh, you won't know me
in my 30s.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.783
I will be so out of here.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.383
You'll be living down the road

27:02.385 --> 27:06.788
in a trailer with five kids
and no husband.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.023
You know what, Harley?

27:08.025 --> 27:09.290
I was going
to do you a favor,

27:09.292 --> 27:11.826
and now you can go
fuck yourself.

27:11.828 --> 27:14.063
The only favor you can do me
is get a job.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.465
What if I knew someone who
wanted to go out with you?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.167
I'm not interested.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.201
You don't even know
who it is.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.840
If it's someone you know,
I'm not interested.

27:25.142 --> 27:27.342
What if she wanted to...

27:27.344 --> 27:30.712
Harley, look at me.

27:30.714 --> 27:33.414
Look at me.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.720
What if she wanted to fuck you?

27:40.990 --> 27:43.057
I'm serious.

27:43.059 --> 27:45.861
Ashlee Breckway.

27:45.863 --> 27:47.429
She has a thing for you.

27:47.431 --> 27:48.963
How old is she?

27:48.965 --> 27:50.798
She's 16.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.134
- Sixteen?
- Mm-hmm.

27:53.136 --> 27:54.838
Forget it.

28:18.028 --> 28:20.194
Looking for something?

28:20.196 --> 28:22.430
I was just
putting it back.

28:22.432 --> 28:24.999
I came by the house
last week.

28:25.001 --> 28:26.434
Did Amber tell you?

28:26.436 --> 28:28.202
Yeah.

28:28.204 --> 28:30.471
Thanks for the stuff
you brought.

28:30.473 --> 28:32.976
Did you look at the book?

28:34.411 --> 28:37.546
I like the Pierre Bonnard
painting,

28:37.548 --> 28:40.783
Earthly Paradise.

28:40.785 --> 28:42.383
It's supposed to be
Adam and Eve, right?

28:42.385 --> 28:45.022
Yeah, right.
What'd you think?

28:46.190 --> 28:48.390
It's pretty accurate.

28:48.392 --> 28:53.528
Eve all relaxed,
laying in the woods.

28:53.530 --> 28:57.966
Adam trying to figure out
where to build a house.

28:57.968 --> 29:00.434
Why would you say
that was accurate?

29:00.436 --> 29:02.437
I don't know.

29:02.439 --> 29:04.539
I guess women are better
at accepting things

29:04.541 --> 29:06.240
the way they are,

29:06.242 --> 29:08.844
while men are always trying
to figure out ways

29:08.846 --> 29:10.414
to change things.

29:12.415 --> 29:14.519
You're very insightful.

29:15.952 --> 29:17.821
Has anyone ever
told you that?

29:22.358 --> 29:24.892
I'll let you
get back to work.

29:24.894 --> 29:26.798
See you around.

29:43.213 --> 29:45.549
- Uncle Mike.
- Hey, Harley.

29:49.286 --> 29:52.054
- Uncle Mike.
- There's my favorite girl.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.255
Hey, sweetheart.

29:54.557 --> 29:56.290
Oh, you're getting heavy.
How are you?

29:56.292 --> 29:58.026
- Good.
- You want a candy bar?

29:58.028 --> 29:59.428
You know where it is?

30:00.897 --> 30:02.197
You're adorable.

30:02.199 --> 30:04.369
All right,
get out of here.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.240
You look like you're going
to kiss me, for Christ's sakes.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.412
You... you get a new couch?

30:15.913 --> 30:17.411
Yeah, thinking about it.

30:17.413 --> 30:20.047
Most people wait
till they have the new one

30:20.049 --> 30:22.220
before they burn the old one,
but...

30:23.386 --> 30:24.955
Yeah, all right.

30:27.357 --> 30:29.892
Yeah, you...

30:29.894 --> 30:31.259
you're going
to have to get

30:31.261 --> 30:34.563
to that soffit and fascia
this year, hmm?

30:34.565 --> 30:36.430
And that window trim?

30:36.432 --> 30:38.467
You're going to need a new coat
of paint on that,

30:38.469 --> 30:41.272
or that wood's just going
to rot right out of there.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.539
You need to fix
your roof.

30:45.541 --> 30:47.477
Tomorrow.

30:50.547 --> 30:53.047
- Hey, Uncle Mike.
- Hey there, baby girl.

30:53.049 --> 30:54.315
How are you?

30:54.317 --> 30:55.886
Good.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.357
- How's Aunt Jan?
- She's doing great.

31:03.661 --> 31:06.027
- How about Mike Junior?
- He's doing fantastic.

31:06.029 --> 31:09.463
He's just tearing it up there
in Ardendale University.

31:09.465 --> 31:12.236
You got a minute?
Do you want to...?

31:23.646 --> 31:26.614
He can run
and catch a ball.

31:30.253 --> 31:31.889
What's so funny?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.523
Kill...

31:34.525 --> 31:36.624
have intercourse.

31:38.394 --> 31:41.098
Yeah, I'm going to leave you two
to your private joke.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.599
Come on, Uncle Mike.

31:44.601 --> 31:46.304
We're just kidding.

31:54.577 --> 31:57.245
You know, a lot of people
are jealous of Mike's success,

31:57.247 --> 32:01.149
and that's how they handle it,
they make fun of him.

32:01.151 --> 32:02.616
I don't come here for me.

32:16.299 --> 32:19.066
Who needs him?

32:19.068 --> 32:20.504
I need him.

33:55.398 --> 33:58.834
Callie. Callie!

33:58.836 --> 34:00.434
Please, help me.

34:00.436 --> 34:02.639
Harley, is that you?

34:04.208 --> 34:05.606
Are you okay?

34:05.608 --> 34:07.508
What's going on?
What happened to your face?

34:07.510 --> 34:09.311
Help me. I can't breathe.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.878
Are you okay?

34:10.880 --> 34:13.451
- Harley. Hey.
- I can't breathe.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.322
Where are you going?

34:21.324 --> 34:22.692
Harley.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.786
Not too hard.

34:53.789 --> 34:56.094
You're going to pull me so hard.

35:18.715 --> 35:20.785
It's okay.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.657
It's okay.

36:30.586 --> 36:32.387
Shit!

36:32.389 --> 36:34.521
- Why'd you do that?
- What the hell are you doing?

36:34.523 --> 36:36.891
I was trying to shoot a rabbit.
I figured you'd be happy.

36:36.893 --> 36:38.459
You're not allowed
to use my gun.

36:38.461 --> 36:40.262
- Why not?
- Because you're just a kid.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.597
So what? I started hunting
with Dad when I was eight.

36:42.599 --> 36:44.733
Besides, I'm not a kid anymore.
I started my period.

36:44.735 --> 36:46.767
Fuck. Don't tell me that.
Tell Amber.

36:46.769 --> 36:49.704
I did. She threw a box
of tampons at me.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.809
Oh, my God.

37:13.963 --> 37:15.532
Jody?

37:24.474 --> 37:26.244
What is that?

37:28.344 --> 37:30.445
What is that?

37:30.447 --> 37:33.416
It was Misty's.
I found it in the woods.

37:41.557 --> 37:43.893
Okay, let's go find the car.

37:45.461 --> 37:47.362
Hey, look, it's Harley!

37:47.364 --> 37:48.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:48.965 --> 37:50.465
Come on, guys.

37:50.467 --> 37:51.833
Can I help you
with your groceries?

37:51.835 --> 37:53.735
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to do that.

37:53.737 --> 37:56.037
- Well, it's kind of my job.
- Oh, yeah. Okay, great.

37:56.039 --> 37:57.572
Sorry. Thanks.

37:57.574 --> 37:59.807
Come on,
let's go to the car.

37:59.809 --> 38:01.742
Brad's out of town
on business,

38:01.744 --> 38:03.744
and I didn't have anyone
to watch the kids,

38:03.746 --> 38:05.512
so I had them
with me tonight.

38:05.514 --> 38:07.882
Sorry, you don't care
about any of that.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.617
All right, come on.

38:09.619 --> 38:11.422
Get in the car.

38:12.655 --> 38:14.956
Scoot through.
Right, there you go.

38:14.958 --> 38:17.858
All right.

38:17.860 --> 38:21.496
Here, help me with that.
Thank you, buddy.

38:21.498 --> 38:23.900
Thank you.
There you go.

38:26.936 --> 38:29.037
Better get them home.

38:29.039 --> 38:33.807
I'm sorry for the way
that I left.

38:33.809 --> 38:36.443
Sorry for everything,
really.

38:36.445 --> 38:38.679
I'm not saying
it wasn't great,

38:38.681 --> 38:42.916
just maybe it shouldn't
have happened.

38:42.918 --> 38:45.487
You were so upset.
I just wanted to help.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.458
I guess there's better ways
to help a person.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.994
Or maybe not.

38:52.996 --> 38:54.829
It's okay.

38:54.831 --> 38:56.563
It's not okay.

38:56.565 --> 38:59.434
I'm married.
I have two little kids.

38:59.436 --> 39:02.036
I'm ten years older
than you.

39:02.038 --> 39:04.171
When I think about you,

39:04.173 --> 39:08.108
I don't think about you being
married or how old you are.

39:08.110 --> 39:10.480
What do you think about?

39:12.014 --> 39:14.516
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.722
Your ass, mostly.

39:19.489 --> 39:20.921
My ass?

39:20.923 --> 39:22.791
Yeah.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.995
You think about
my ass a lot?

39:26.563 --> 39:28.729
Define "a lot".

39:28.731 --> 39:30.764
Once a day.

39:30.766 --> 39:31.999
Yeah.

39:35.038 --> 39:36.637
- Hey!
- Hey!

39:36.639 --> 39:38.907
Guys, all right,
I hear you.

39:38.909 --> 39:41.045
We're going to go
in just a second.

39:43.847 --> 39:47.084
It's obviously not a great time
to talk about this.

39:48.518 --> 39:50.485
If you want to come by
after work,

39:50.487 --> 39:53.588
Brad's out of town,
like I said.

39:53.590 --> 39:54.959
Okay.

39:56.126 --> 39:57.958
Okay.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.793
I'll see you tonight.

40:01.898 --> 40:04.132
Okay, okay, I hear you.

40:04.134 --> 40:07.001
Please, I beg you,
please, be nice to each other.

40:19.682 --> 40:21.182
You have to be firm.

40:21.184 --> 40:24.719
If a little girl steals a grape,
don't yell at her.

40:24.721 --> 40:25.920
Let her have it.

40:25.922 --> 40:27.554
Altmyer.

40:27.556 --> 40:29.123
What's the deal
with your shirttail?

40:29.125 --> 40:31.159
You look like hell.

40:31.161 --> 40:32.827
Is that it?

40:32.829 --> 40:34.729
No, that's not it.

40:34.731 --> 40:37.565
You were late today.

40:37.567 --> 40:39.099
Am I fired?

40:39.101 --> 40:41.603
Jesus Christ, Altmyer.
You're not fired.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.671
Just don't do it again, okay?
Can you do that?

40:44.673 --> 40:46.608
One other thing.
I got a complaint.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.209
I had a customer call.

40:49.211 --> 40:50.979
She said you put
hair-care product

40:50.981 --> 40:53.014
in the same bag
with lettuce.

40:53.016 --> 40:55.485
What's going on
with you, son?

40:57.253 --> 41:01.088
Get it together.
Don't let it happen again, okay?

41:01.090 --> 41:03.291
Now, tuck your shirt in.

41:03.293 --> 41:06.230
Be proud.
Be Robinson proud.

41:21.143 --> 41:22.946
Can I take your coat?

41:39.128 --> 41:41.061
Want a beer?

41:41.063 --> 41:42.665
Sure.

41:55.077 --> 41:57.114
You never told me
what happened last night.

42:04.186 --> 42:06.656
Is everything okay at home?

42:08.291 --> 42:10.094
Yeah.

42:15.197 --> 42:16.799
No.

42:18.233 --> 42:20.703
Everything's not okay.

42:23.306 --> 42:26.242
Is there anything
I can do to help?

42:30.380 --> 42:32.615
You can fuck me again.

42:50.666 --> 42:52.166
Shit.

42:52.168 --> 42:53.938
I'm sorry.

43:33.376 --> 43:35.208
Harley?

43:35.210 --> 43:37.680
You got to go.
I'm sorry.

43:38.882 --> 43:40.280
Sorry to rush you off
like this,

43:40.282 --> 43:42.150
but Zack's already awake.

43:42.152 --> 43:43.985
I don't know when
I can see you again,

43:43.987 --> 43:47.921
between the kids,
Brad and your two jobs.

43:47.923 --> 43:49.893
I can quit one.

44:52.454 --> 44:54.692
Harley, what are you doing?

44:58.293 --> 44:59.860
Where were you?

44:59.862 --> 45:02.028
Where were you all night?

45:02.030 --> 45:04.898
We had a crisis.

45:04.900 --> 45:06.534
Is Jody okay?

45:06.536 --> 45:08.135
Yes.

45:08.137 --> 45:09.369
Misty?

45:09.371 --> 45:12.373
Yes, they're fine.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.141
Where's my gun?

45:14.143 --> 45:16.811
I don't fucking know.
It's nothing bad like that.

45:16.813 --> 45:18.780
You called it a crisis.

45:18.782 --> 45:20.081
Maybe it's not a crisis,

45:20.083 --> 45:22.016
but it's a big fucking deal,
okay?

45:22.018 --> 45:24.552
I found a thousand dollars
in Misty's room last night.

45:24.554 --> 45:26.554
What?

45:26.556 --> 45:29.927
She's probably still sitting
on her bed guarding the money.

45:34.463 --> 45:38.331
It's mine.
I'm the one who found it.

45:38.333 --> 45:40.036
Give me the money.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.070
You can't hurt me.

45:44.072 --> 45:48.508
You're my legal guardian.
You have to take care of me.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.311
I had to take it.

45:50.313 --> 45:54.481
She was saving up to take us
and leave Daddy.

45:54.483 --> 45:56.249
It's not yours, it's Mom's.

45:56.251 --> 45:58.119
And she doesn't even know
you have it.

45:58.121 --> 46:00.057
Now give it to me.

46:03.592 --> 46:05.492
Okay.

46:05.494 --> 46:08.464
Let's ask her and see
what she wants us to do with it.

46:13.168 --> 46:14.869
She can't have any visitors.

46:14.871 --> 46:16.537
You flipped out.

46:16.539 --> 46:18.876
She can have calls.

46:21.143 --> 46:23.279
Now give me the money.

46:24.547 --> 46:26.880
You know I can take
that money from you.

46:26.882 --> 46:29.150
I might have to hurt you
to do it, but I can do it.

46:29.152 --> 46:32.019
Now give it to me.

46:58.146 --> 47:00.648
Now I can get my license.

47:00.650 --> 47:02.516
Are you crazy?

47:02.518 --> 47:04.985
Hmm?

47:04.987 --> 47:07.420
You said we need
a thousand bucks.

47:07.422 --> 47:11.092
Yeah. I need that money
for the taxes on the house.

47:11.094 --> 47:12.659
What are you talking about?

47:12.661 --> 47:14.494
The taxes.

47:14.496 --> 47:17.632
They're due in two weeks,
and we don't have any of it.

47:17.634 --> 47:19.969
Okay, and whose fault
is that?

47:24.440 --> 47:28.108
Give me the money.
Give me the money.

47:28.110 --> 47:31.211
I hate you, Harley!
You're such a fucking prick!

47:31.213 --> 47:33.317
I hate you!

47:47.496 --> 47:50.164
Harley, what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

47:50.166 --> 47:51.599
You said you were going
to call me.

47:51.601 --> 47:53.099
Why haven't you called me?

47:53.101 --> 47:55.336
- I didn't get a chance.
- Bullshit.

47:55.338 --> 47:57.204
You could have called me
anytime.

47:57.206 --> 48:00.106
You could have said you wanted
to speak to me about Jody.

48:00.108 --> 48:03.010
Don't you have two jobs?

48:03.012 --> 48:04.445
Yeah, so?

48:04.447 --> 48:06.313
So, the problem isn't
when can I call you,

48:06.315 --> 48:09.650
it's when are you home
for me to talk to you?

48:09.652 --> 48:13.086
- I usually come home for dinner.
- Oh, dinnertime, that's great.

48:13.088 --> 48:15.356
That's when I'm cooking
and feeding two hungry kids

48:15.358 --> 48:17.691
while my husband bitches
about his day and has a drink.

48:17.693 --> 48:19.961
Should I interrupt him and say,
"Hey, babe, I need to call

48:19.963 --> 48:21.561
the neighbor kid and see
if he wants to come over

48:21.563 --> 48:24.197
so I can fuck his brains out"?
Is that what I should do?

48:24.199 --> 48:27.169
Yeah, that's exactly
what you should do.

48:31.139 --> 48:32.273
Zack is right here.

48:32.275 --> 48:34.275
- Let's go inside.
- I can't.

48:34.277 --> 48:35.612
I ca...

49:16.619 --> 49:18.588
Here you go, bud.

49:20.356 --> 49:22.655
I found this
in Esme's backpack.

49:22.657 --> 49:25.059
She and Jody send notes
back and forth all the time.

49:25.061 --> 49:26.594
But this one
kind of concerned me.

49:26.596 --> 49:28.298
I thought you should have it.

49:29.632 --> 49:31.298
I asked Esme about it.

49:31.300 --> 49:33.300
She said Jody was just trying
to gross her out.

49:33.302 --> 49:35.068
But if this is true,
it's disturbing.

49:35.070 --> 49:39.039
You might want to talk
to Misty about it.

49:39.041 --> 49:41.041
When can I see you again?

49:41.043 --> 49:43.077
I don't know.

49:43.079 --> 49:45.612
Do you know the abandoned
mining office

49:45.614 --> 49:46.813
by the railroad tracks?

49:46.815 --> 49:49.986
I thought we could
go there.

49:53.456 --> 49:55.222
Okay.

49:55.224 --> 49:57.090
How about...

49:57.092 --> 49:58.592
Wednesday?

49:58.594 --> 50:01.097
I think that's the first time
I can get away.

50:04.099 --> 50:05.768
Sure.

50:31.693 --> 50:34.695
I want to ask you something.

50:34.697 --> 50:36.563
And I want you to be honest.

50:36.565 --> 50:38.334
Okay.

50:41.336 --> 50:43.172
Was I your first?

50:44.507 --> 50:47.575
First what?

50:47.577 --> 50:49.577
Woman.

50:49.579 --> 50:54.051
Was I the first woman
you've ever had sex with?

50:59.387 --> 51:02.590
Harley, I'm sorry.

51:02.592 --> 51:05.061
I'm sorry I didn't know
at the time.

51:06.461 --> 51:08.364
I hope it was memorable.

51:11.833 --> 51:13.636
I remember it.

51:25.148 --> 51:27.250
This was a good idea.

51:28.684 --> 51:32.186
We could do it
every Wednesday night.

51:32.188 --> 51:34.590
- Yeah.
- Would that make you happy?

52:19.969 --> 52:21.505
Callie?

52:36.552 --> 52:39.155
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

52:41.690 --> 52:44.758
It's a hypothetical question.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.530
Go on.

52:52.367 --> 52:55.172
Can a kid think it's okay
to get hit?

52:58.574 --> 53:01.744
Did you think it was okay
for your father to hit you?

53:04.246 --> 53:05.945
This isn't about me.

53:05.947 --> 53:07.783
You can still answer
the question.

53:10.452 --> 53:13.190
I didn't think it was okay,
but...

53:16.891 --> 53:18.928
I thought it was normal.

53:31.273 --> 53:33.809
What about sexually abused kids?

53:35.043 --> 53:36.913
Can they think it's okay?

53:39.382 --> 53:41.318
You talking about Misty?

53:44.853 --> 53:46.920
What do you know
about Misty?

53:46.922 --> 53:48.688
I don't know much about her.

53:48.690 --> 53:50.523
We only had a few sessions
together.

53:50.525 --> 53:53.327
But in the few we did,

53:53.329 --> 53:56.496
I had the feeling she was in
a very unhealthy relationship

53:56.498 --> 53:59.335
with your father.

54:09.644 --> 54:12.248
Who was sexually abused, Harley?

54:18.853 --> 54:20.887
No one.

54:20.889 --> 54:23.324
What about Amber?

54:23.326 --> 54:24.958
Amber.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.561
She was never alone with Dad.
She hated him.

54:27.563 --> 54:28.896
Yeah? How do you know?

54:28.898 --> 54:30.798
I was there.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.836
I saw.

54:34.769 --> 54:36.403
How did you feel
toward Amber

54:36.405 --> 54:39.773
when you saw her being hit
by your father?

54:39.775 --> 54:41.008
What do you mean?

54:41.010 --> 54:43.413
Did you want to help her?

54:50.820 --> 54:52.889
I wanted to make her
feel better.

54:54.824 --> 54:56.623
And how do you think she felt

54:56.625 --> 54:58.427
when she saw your father
hit you?

55:05.668 --> 55:07.470
I don't know.

55:13.842 --> 55:15.844
I guess she didn't like it.

55:18.847 --> 55:21.518
Did she want to make you
feel better?

55:27.789 --> 55:29.655
It's okay, Harley.

55:29.657 --> 55:32.492
Harley, please do not walk away.
We need to talk about this.

55:32.494 --> 55:35.496
Harley.

55:51.679 --> 55:54.081
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

55:54.083 --> 55:56.550
Amber's running away.

55:56.552 --> 55:59.052
I asked you
who you were.

55:59.054 --> 56:00.987
I'm a friend of Amber's.

56:00.989 --> 56:03.523
You must be her brother.

56:03.525 --> 56:04.891
The bag boy.

56:04.893 --> 56:06.159
Don't hurt him, Harley.

56:06.161 --> 56:08.829
- Hurt him.
- Hurt me?

56:08.831 --> 56:11.000
Just make him go away.

56:13.168 --> 56:15.735
I think you should leave.

56:15.737 --> 56:18.375
Come on, let's go.

56:23.211 --> 56:24.711
I'm leaving you!

56:24.713 --> 56:26.179
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

56:26.181 --> 56:28.081
I don't want to live with you
anymore.

56:28.083 --> 56:30.150
Don't go, please.

56:30.152 --> 56:31.617
I'm sorry, Jody.

56:31.619 --> 56:33.153
I don't want to,
but I have to, okay?

56:33.155 --> 56:35.822
So be mad at Harley
because it's Harley's fault!

56:35.824 --> 56:36.990
What did I do?

56:36.992 --> 56:39.525
You know exactly
what you did.

56:39.527 --> 56:41.461
Now can you get
out of the fucking way?

56:47.902 --> 56:50.670
Why did you let her go?

56:50.672 --> 56:53.039
- She'll be back.
- No, she won't.

56:53.041 --> 56:55.008
Yes, she will.

56:55.010 --> 56:57.211
That boy only wants one thing
from her, okay?

56:57.213 --> 56:58.979
And when he gets it,

56:58.981 --> 57:01.481
he's going to dump her
in a parking lot somewhere.

57:01.483 --> 57:02.916
Does he want her pillow?

57:02.918 --> 57:04.617
Yeah, he wants
her pillow.

57:04.619 --> 57:07.688
Will you get her
in the parking lot?

57:07.690 --> 57:09.222
I will, I promise you.

57:09.224 --> 57:10.824
Promise?

57:10.826 --> 57:12.728
I promise.

57:24.273 --> 57:27.206
This is all Misty's fault.

57:27.208 --> 57:29.208
Why do you say that?

57:29.210 --> 57:33.579
She told Amber something today,
and it made her really mad.

57:33.581 --> 57:34.780
What did she tell her?

57:34.782 --> 57:36.215
I don't know.

57:36.217 --> 57:37.985
They went in her room
and closed the door.

57:37.987 --> 57:39.186
It was about you, though.

57:39.188 --> 57:42.623
I heard your name
a bunch of times.

57:42.625 --> 57:45.925
I asked Misty to tell me,
but she said it was a secret.

57:45.927 --> 57:48.729
Misty keeps secrets
better than anybody.

57:48.731 --> 57:50.630
She said I won't be able
to keep it,

57:50.632 --> 57:53.166
but I keep lots of secrets
for her.

57:53.168 --> 57:55.269
Like what?

57:55.271 --> 57:57.704
I can't tell you.
They're secrets.

57:57.706 --> 58:00.606
You know, when Misty tells you
you can't tell anyone,

58:00.608 --> 58:02.742
she's not talking about me.

58:02.744 --> 58:04.146
Yes, she is.

58:06.849 --> 58:08.782
Did Misty ask you
to keep a secret

58:08.784 --> 58:10.650
about that shirt of hers
you found?

58:10.652 --> 58:12.286
No.

58:12.288 --> 58:15.588
But you know something about it
and you won't tell me.

58:15.590 --> 58:17.257
Why?

58:17.259 --> 58:19.128
Mm...

58:22.197 --> 58:24.901
Where did all that blood
come from?

58:27.235 --> 58:29.702
From Daddy, I guess.

58:29.704 --> 58:33.039
But Misty was at the mall
when Daddy got shot.

58:33.041 --> 58:35.008
You were the only one home
that night

58:35.010 --> 58:37.213
with Mommy and Daddy,
remember?

58:38.713 --> 58:40.112
Misty was at the mall.

58:40.114 --> 58:42.349
I know.
Mommy drove her there.

58:42.351 --> 58:45.719
When did Mommy
drive her there?

58:45.721 --> 58:47.186
After she shot Daddy.

58:47.188 --> 58:48.789
- Who shot Daddy?
- Mommy.

58:48.791 --> 58:50.994
Everybody knows that.

58:52.327 --> 58:54.061
Did you see it happen?

58:54.063 --> 58:55.762
You know I didn't.

58:55.764 --> 58:57.898
I was in my room,
I heard a bang,

58:57.900 --> 59:00.633
and I went out
and I saw Daddy on the floor,

59:00.635 --> 59:02.838
and I went and hid
in the woods.

59:09.043 --> 59:10.844
But Misty was there?

59:10.846 --> 59:13.713
She was hugging Daddy.

59:13.715 --> 59:16.682
And then you saw Mommy
drive away with Misty.

59:16.684 --> 59:18.153
Yeah.

59:20.054 --> 59:22.356
What did Mommy do
when she got back?

59:22.358 --> 59:24.891
She got a shovel
and went in the woods.

59:24.893 --> 59:27.260
I thought she was going
to bury Daddy.

59:27.262 --> 59:29.162
But she buried Misty's shirt
instead.

59:29.164 --> 59:30.833
Yeah.

59:33.735 --> 59:36.737
Why didn't you tell the police
Misty was home that night?

59:36.739 --> 59:38.405
They didn't ask me.

59:38.407 --> 59:41.878
They just asked me if I saw
Mommy shoot Daddy, and I didn't.

59:53.121 --> 59:54.987
Hi, Betty.

59:54.989 --> 59:56.657
This is Harley Altmyer.

59:56.659 --> 59:58.391
I'm sorry to call you
on a Saturday,

59:58.393 --> 01:00:01.695
but I really need
to see my mom.

01:00:01.697 --> 01:00:05.865
The problem is I'm not allowed
to see her anymore.

01:00:05.867 --> 01:00:08.003
I thought maybe
you could get me in.

01:00:10.204 --> 01:00:13.342
Maybe you could tell them
it would be good for me.

01:00:35.998 --> 01:00:38.800
How is everything at home?

01:00:41.302 --> 01:00:45.271
Nobody's shot anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:49.275
That supposed
to be funny?

01:00:49.277 --> 01:00:51.146
It wasn't.

01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:57.016
What's wrong?

01:00:57.018 --> 01:00:58.284
Hmm?

01:00:58.286 --> 01:01:00.820
You look sick, baby.

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:02.958
I'm fine.

01:01:05.159 --> 01:01:08.295
You're not taking care
of yourself.

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:12.164
When was the last time you slept
or changed your clothes?

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:15.168
Did you know
Misty took your money?

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:17.137
The thousand dollars
you had saved up.

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:19.005
Did you know she took it?

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:22.311
Amber found it
last week.

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.213
Did you know about it?

01:01:28.483 --> 01:01:33.253
I thought your dad
had taken that money.

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:35.057
He didn't.

01:01:37.492 --> 01:01:39.291
Mom.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:41.998
Mom, the money.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.471
Well, I guess
it'll come in handy.

01:01:50.038 --> 01:01:51.371
Fine.

01:01:51.373 --> 01:01:54.143
Don't talk to me,
but then I'm done.

01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:57.543
What do you mean?

01:01:57.545 --> 01:02:01.782
I'm done. Done taking care
of your fucking kids.

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.784
I'm packing up my shit
and I'm leaving.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.017
You would never.

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:07.554
You'd never leave the girls.

01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:09.121
Why not?

01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:11.291
You did.

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:13.325
What are you talking about?

01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:16.496
I didn't leave anyone
on purpose.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:19.833
Look around you.
I'm in prison!

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:22.304
You fucking like it here.

01:02:24.206 --> 01:02:25.807
Hmm?

01:02:29.143 --> 01:02:32.878
You're talking stupid, okay?

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.880
I don't love them.

01:02:34.882 --> 01:02:38.351
I don't feel any obligation
to them.

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:40.990
It's not my job.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.896
Okay.

01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:52.566
Okay, Harley.

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:56.239
Okay.

01:02:58.206 --> 01:03:00.273
Misty took the money.

01:03:00.275 --> 01:03:03.510
What do you want me
to tell you?

01:03:03.512 --> 01:03:05.278
I was...

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.313
I was saving it up

01:03:07.315 --> 01:03:11.284
and I was going to leave
your dad, okay?

01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:13.353
I was.

01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:16.925
What was going on
between Dad and Misty?

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.100
I don't know
what you mean.

01:03:26.268 --> 01:03:29.401
Please, tell me the truth.

01:03:29.403 --> 01:03:31.070
You owe me.

01:03:31.072 --> 01:03:33.340
I don't...

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.608
I don't.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.575
I don't owe you anything.

01:03:36.577 --> 01:03:40.112
Fucking tell me.
Fucking tell me.

01:03:40.114 --> 01:03:42.818
I never saw anything.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.923
Did you ask Dad?

01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:51.258
- Hmm?
- I don't...

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.592
How do you ask?

01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:55.095
How do you ask
a question like that?

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.966
You asked Misty.

01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:00.133
What? If he what?

01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:04.037
How do you ask anybody
a question like that?

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.275
So, you never knew anything
for sure?

01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:10.879
I found her shirt.

01:04:12.581 --> 01:04:14.347
- I know she was there.
- What?

01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:17.450
I know she did it.
I know Misty killed Dad.

01:04:17.452 --> 01:04:19.385
I don't get it.

01:04:19.387 --> 01:04:22.322
You didn't have
to take the blame.

01:04:22.324 --> 01:04:24.124
Nothing would have
happened to you.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.659
- You don't understand.
- She's just a kid.

01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:30.165
You don't understand,
Harley.

01:04:31.565 --> 01:04:33.499
She wouldn't have
gotten in trouble.

01:04:33.501 --> 01:04:35.367
She would have gotten help.

01:04:35.369 --> 01:04:38.204
- She needs help.
- You don't understand.

01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:39.673
Were you embarrassed?

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.708
You didn't want
anyone to know?

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:46.079
Misty didn't want
your dad dead!

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.380
Is that why you said
you fucking did it?

01:04:48.382 --> 01:04:50.083
She...

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:52.351
She was aiming it at me!

01:04:52.353 --> 01:04:55.188
She was jealous of me!

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:59.461
She was trying to kill me
and he got in the way!

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:04.396
You're fucking crazy.

01:05:04.398 --> 01:05:07.032
You're crazy.

01:05:07.034 --> 01:05:09.202
I'm not the crazy one!

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:10.637
I'm not!

01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:12.438
You're fucking
hiding in here.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.641
You're fucking hiding in here.
Why did you leave me?

01:05:14.643 --> 01:05:17.010
- That's it.
- I'm not hiding!

01:05:17.012 --> 01:05:18.677
Come on.

01:05:18.679 --> 01:05:20.280
I just want my mom.

01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:22.385
I want my fucking mom!

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:45.738
Hi, Harley.

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.443
Amber came back.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.748
This is temporary.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.749
I'm not going to live with you
anymore.

01:05:56.751 --> 01:05:59.318
I'm moving in with Dylan.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.692
Did he do that
to your face?

01:06:05.793 --> 01:06:08.061
Hmm?

01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:12.065
Why do you give yourself
to assholes like that?

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:14.536
You don't even make them
work for it.

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:17.739
They want me.

01:07:23.804 --> 01:07:25.871
Let's get something straight,
Harley.

01:07:25.873 --> 01:07:29.575
You don't ever come to my house
when Brad's around.

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:31.478
I came to pick up Jody.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.246
You didn't come to pick up Jody.
Brad took Jody home hours ago.

01:07:34.248 --> 01:07:35.581
You came to make a scene.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.217
And what do you want me
to tell Brad

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.119
when he asks
why I had to come out here,

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.452
why you had to talk to me,

01:07:40.454 --> 01:07:41.820
why I had to sit here
in your truck?

01:07:41.822 --> 01:07:44.389
And don't tell me
to tell him the truth.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:50.295
- Where'd you go today?
- I went shopping.

01:07:50.297 --> 01:07:52.599
- Where'd you go Thursday?
- To the fucking library.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.900
What is this?

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:55.901
Why are you asking me
where I've been?

01:07:55.903 --> 01:07:59.208
Where I go is none
of your business!

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:03.546
I wanted to make sure
you weren't mad at me.

01:08:05.847 --> 01:08:07.646
Mad at you for what?

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:10.282
You left.

01:08:10.284 --> 01:08:12.454
When? Wednesday?

01:08:15.322 --> 01:08:18.524
You knew I had to leave.

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.359
Do you think we could
do it sometime

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.594
when you didn't
have to leave?

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:26.398
Why did you really
come here?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.634
Did you really think
I was going to come out here

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.269
and give you what you wanted

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:32.541
while my husband and kids
were sitting inside?

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:36.776
I'm not going
to fuck up my family.

01:08:36.778 --> 01:08:38.814
I'm not going to do it.

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:41.750
Do you understand?

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:45.250
Do you understand?

01:08:45.252 --> 01:08:47.421
But I love you.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.729
Let's just...

01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:59.466
stick to the mining office
like we planned.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.439
Okay.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:14.250
I'll see you Wednesday.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.662
Altmyer.

01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:33.700
Man, do not come back here
until you take a bath.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:38.638
Oh, God, Jesus.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.341
Whoo.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.403
I was going
to leave you a note,

01:10:11.405 --> 01:10:12.972
but I thought it was
a big enough deal

01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:15.708
that I should say bye to you
in person.

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.977
Who's watching Jody?

01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:20.345
Fuck you. I'm standing here
telling you

01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:21.848
I'm never going
to see you again,

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:24.384
and all you care about
is who's watching Jody.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:27.519
Misty's watching her.

01:10:27.521 --> 01:10:29.621
I don't like Misty
watching Jody.

01:10:29.623 --> 01:10:31.057
Well, that's too fucking bad,

01:10:31.059 --> 01:10:33.896
because that's all you got
anymore.

01:10:35.396 --> 01:10:37.929
Where are you going?

01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:40.566
I'm moving in
with Dylan.

01:10:40.568 --> 01:10:41.968
I'm serious.

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:45.374
He's way different
from all the other guys.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.508
Why?

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.412
Because he hits you?

01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:54.382
Is that what you want?
Someone to hit you?

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:59.751
I don't get it.

01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:02.655
You didn't like it
when Dad hit you.

01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:04.693
Or did you?

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.496
You're sick.

01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:10.832
Would you stay if I hit you?

01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:17.472
Well, do you want me to stay?

01:11:18.806 --> 01:11:20.339
If you want.

01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:23.411
Well, are you
asking me to stay?

01:11:26.547 --> 01:11:29.581
Till you figure things out,
sure.

01:11:29.583 --> 01:11:33.986
Well, Dylan will be really mad
if I stay.

01:11:33.988 --> 01:11:35.455
For Christ's sakes, Amber.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.923
Tell him I won't let you.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:39.728
Really? You want me
to tell him that?

01:11:41.796 --> 01:11:43.432
Yeah.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.869
Okay.

01:13:38.479 --> 01:13:39.847
Fuck.

01:13:42.884 --> 01:13:45.585
- Fuck.
- What's wrong?

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.687
Fuck. Put some fucking
clothes on.

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.621
You were liking it.

01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:51.057
Put some clothes on.

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:53.526
You said you wanted me to stay.

01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:56.062
Get off me. Get off me.

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.897
Fucking get off me!

01:13:57.899 --> 01:14:00.068
What's wrong with you?

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.842
You thought it was her.

01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:12.711
You thought you were
fucking her.

01:14:18.653 --> 01:14:20.887
I know all about it!

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:25.124
I know all about you and her
in that fucking shed!

01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:36.171
She doesn't love you.

01:14:38.238 --> 01:14:40.741
She doesn't love you!

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.581
She could never love you.

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:54.856
Amber used to touch me
when we were kids.

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:59.724
I remember.

01:14:59.726 --> 01:15:02.663
She used to come into bed
with me and touch me.

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:06.167
Where did she touch you?

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:12.170
You need to say it,
Harley.

01:15:12.172 --> 01:15:15.708
You need to say it in order
to confront it

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.880
so it can go away.

01:15:20.247 --> 01:15:23.715
It's not ever
going to go away.

01:15:23.717 --> 01:15:26.619
It can fade
to almost nothing.

01:15:26.621 --> 01:15:28.556
It can, I promise.

01:15:30.358 --> 01:15:32.561
She touched you where?

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.634
My penis.

01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.635
Did you touch her?

01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:44.970
No.

01:15:44.972 --> 01:15:46.774
She was behind me.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:50.977
She came into my bed.

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:53.981
Why do you think
she came into your bed?

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.249
Hmm?

01:15:58.819 --> 01:16:00.188
Think about it.

01:16:02.222 --> 01:16:04.690
She was afraid of Dad.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.828
And you let her stay?

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.634
- Why?
- I was afraid of him too.

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:22.911
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harley.

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:30.148
You are not a bad person.

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:33.385
There is nothing wrong
with you or Amber.

01:16:33.387 --> 01:16:36.755
You were children
reacting to abuse

01:16:36.757 --> 01:16:39.025
the only way you knew how:

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.762
by turning to each other
for comfort.

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:54.339
What made you remember?

01:16:54.341 --> 01:16:56.075
Do you know?

01:16:56.077 --> 01:16:58.076
Did something happen?

01:16:58.078 --> 01:17:01.013
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:17:01.015 --> 01:17:04.383
- You can.
- No, I can't.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:06.184
You can.

01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:08.687
What happened?

01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:13.692
She was in bed with me
and I was sleeping.

01:17:13.694 --> 01:17:15.027
When?

01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:16.832
Last night.

01:17:18.966 --> 01:17:21.103
Did she touch you?

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:26.972
I don't know.

01:17:26.974 --> 01:17:29.744
I was sleeping,
and she...

01:17:31.112 --> 01:17:33.715
she didn't have
any clothes on.

01:17:35.182 --> 01:17:37.049
How did you react?

01:17:37.051 --> 01:17:38.983
What do you mean?

01:17:38.985 --> 01:17:41.219
What kind of question is that?
I'm not...

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:42.353
I'm not sick.

01:17:42.355 --> 01:17:45.156
I am not implying you are.

01:17:45.158 --> 01:17:48.427
I'm thinking
about Amber now.

01:17:48.429 --> 01:17:51.397
I'm concerned about
how she might be feeling.

01:17:51.399 --> 01:17:52.932
This was all her fault.

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.433
She was the one
who wanted to do it.

01:17:54.435 --> 01:17:55.934
No, she didn't want to do it.

01:17:55.936 --> 01:17:59.205
- She did.
- Harley, try to understand.

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:03.209
Your sister
isn't the villain here.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:06.847
She is suffering
just as much as you are.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:12.218
Where's Amber right now?

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.222
I don't know.

01:18:15.789 --> 01:18:17.857
It doesn't matter.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:21.794
She can take care
of herself.

01:18:21.796 --> 01:18:25.701
Right now, you're feeling
shame and guilt.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:28.067
Amber is feeling all that,

01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:31.807
but she's also
feeling rejected.

01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:37.276
I want you to lie down
on the couch here

01:18:37.278 --> 01:18:39.410
and get some rest.

01:18:39.412 --> 01:18:41.213
My jobs.

01:18:41.215 --> 01:18:42.548
Don't worry.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.387
I'll take care
of everything.

01:19:44.845 --> 01:19:47.148
I heard your fight
with Amber.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.952
What did you hear?

01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:56.187
I heard you
screaming at her

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:59.560
and telling her
to put her clothes back on.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:05.533
Look, I don't care
what you and Amber do.

01:20:08.034 --> 01:20:10.870
We're not that different,
you know.

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:13.041
The way we think.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.308
We're both sort of weird.

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.245
I'm not really the way
a girl's supposed to be,

01:20:20.247 --> 01:20:23.951
and you're not really the way
a guy's supposed to be.

01:20:26.186 --> 01:20:29.220
What do you mean?

01:20:29.222 --> 01:20:30.623
I mean, you hate sports

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.558
and you keep that art book
in your truck.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.661
There's nothing wrong
with a guy liking art.

01:20:36.663 --> 01:20:40.499
And there's nothing wrong
with a girl liking to hunt.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.470
Nobody said there was.

01:20:44.604 --> 01:20:47.639
Dad thought there was.

01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:49.407
Dad loved taking you hunting.

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.445
No, he didn't.

01:20:52.613 --> 01:20:55.179
He took me
because I wanted to go.

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:58.619
But he always wished
that I was you.

01:21:01.488 --> 01:21:03.187
He loved you.

01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:04.990
No, he didn't.

01:21:04.992 --> 01:21:08.163
He didn't love me
like he loved Mom.

01:21:09.363 --> 01:21:11.566
That's a different
kind of love.

01:21:14.068 --> 01:21:15.604
He never hit her.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:20.406
Did you ever
think about that?

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.410
He never touched her.

01:21:24.945 --> 01:21:28.315
That's probably why
she didn't care that he hit us.

01:21:31.418 --> 01:21:33.255
She cared.

01:21:35.021 --> 01:21:37.458
Then why didn't she try
to stop him?

01:21:41.962 --> 01:21:44.064
I know what you did.

01:21:47.201 --> 01:21:49.237
I know the truth.

01:21:59.613 --> 01:22:02.714
Don't you have
anything to say?

01:22:02.716 --> 01:22:05.653
You're the one
that should have done it.

01:22:21.534 --> 01:22:23.402
Hi, this is Dr. Parks.

01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:25.336
It's Wednesday, 7:00 p.m.

01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:27.339
I'm at my home office.

01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:30.142
Amber. Amber?

01:22:30.144 --> 01:22:33.144
If you're there,
please, call me back.

01:23:59.332 --> 01:24:02.103
I didn't know
what else to do.

01:24:11.511 --> 01:24:12.777
What about me?

01:24:12.779 --> 01:24:15.349
Who's going to take care of me?

01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:32.263
So, this woman.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:34.402
How do you know her?

01:24:40.373 --> 01:24:42.810
She's a neighbor.

01:24:44.478 --> 01:24:47.812
Jody plays with her kid.

01:24:47.814 --> 01:24:50.616
Is Jody the little one
we found hiding in the woods

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:53.388
the night your daddy was shot?

01:24:55.788 --> 01:24:57.255
Yeah.

01:24:57.257 --> 01:24:59.626
She's the little one.

01:25:11.505 --> 01:25:14.606
I want to make a call.

01:25:14.608 --> 01:25:16.909
We're not done yet.

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:20.148
I get one phone call,
and I want to make it now.

01:25:24.918 --> 01:25:26.384
All right.

01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:27.785
Go ahead.

01:25:27.787 --> 01:25:29.590
Make your phone call.

01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:49.575
Hello?

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.779
Uncle Mike?

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.283
It's me, Harley.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:58.817
I want to talk to Jody.

01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:00.652
Jody?

01:26:00.654 --> 01:26:04.423
Jody's in bed asleep.

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.657
What are you doing
calling here?

01:26:06.659 --> 01:26:08.360
I get one call.

01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:11.530
This is your
one phone call?

01:26:12.966 --> 01:26:14.732
Yeah.

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:16.768
Jesus, Harley.

01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:20.671
They might give you
the death penalty for this.

01:26:26.546 --> 01:26:28.780
Right.

01:26:28.782 --> 01:26:30.418
I know.

01:26:31.652 --> 01:26:33.384
You get one phone call,

01:26:33.386 --> 01:26:36.456
and you call a six-year-old
little girl.

01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:43.664
Uncle Mike.

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:46.900
Uncle Mike.

01:26:48.368 --> 01:26:50.835
I'm sorry.
I can't wake her.

01:26:57.944 --> 01:27:00.715
You know much
about guns, Harley?

01:27:02.048 --> 01:27:03.784
Some.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:07.885
Enough to know how powerful
that rifle of yours is,

01:27:07.887 --> 01:27:10.925
and the damage it can cause
at close range?

01:27:12.859 --> 01:27:16.628
So, my question to you is,

01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:20.598
why didn't you shoot her
from a distance?

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.535
You got a nice scope
on that rifle.

01:27:23.537 --> 01:27:27.071
You could have climbed up
those hills behind her house

01:27:27.073 --> 01:27:28.674
and shot her
in the front yard

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.741
and said it was
a hunting accident,

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:33.445
and no one would have
suspected anything,

01:27:33.447 --> 01:27:35.613
because no one knew
there was anything going on

01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:38.383
between you two,
right?

01:27:38.385 --> 01:27:40.688
Her husband didn't know.

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:44.792
Did you tell him?

01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:47.662
No.

01:27:49.529 --> 01:27:54.098
But I did talk with him
when we retrieved the body.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:59.039
And he said you liked her,
and she was fond of you.

01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:05.579
I want to go to jail.

01:28:12.118 --> 01:28:14.919
Fair enough.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:17.491
I just have one more question
for you.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.530
- Okay.
- Why did you kill her?

01:28:28.735 --> 01:28:31.469
What do you mean?

01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:33.807
You loved her, right?

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.675
Yeah.

01:28:37.677 --> 01:28:39.811
Well, I'm not saying
people that love each other

01:28:39.813 --> 01:28:42.013
don't kill each other,
but they usually think

01:28:42.015 --> 01:28:44.952
they have a pretty good reason
for doing it.

01:28:46.953 --> 01:28:50.388
I wanted her to leave
her husband

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:53.427
and she said
she wouldn't.

01:28:54.661 --> 01:28:56.564
So you killed her?

01:29:03.804 --> 01:29:06.905
Okay, let me see if I can
get this straight here.

01:29:06.907 --> 01:29:08.876
You...

01:29:10.743 --> 01:29:13.711
you're going to meet with her
to have sex with her,

01:29:13.713 --> 01:29:15.714
and you decide to kill her.

01:29:15.716 --> 01:29:17.749
Then you throw up
next to her body,

01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:20.986
and you fold her hands
peacefully across her chest,

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.455
you drive yourself
to the police station

01:29:23.457 --> 01:29:25.723
and give us a nice,
neat confession.

01:29:25.725 --> 01:29:28.626
And then you call your baby
sister to see how she's doing.

01:29:28.628 --> 01:29:30.064
Is that about right?

01:29:35.502 --> 01:29:37.535
The only problem
with that is,

01:29:37.537 --> 01:29:40.871
is you're talking about
two people.

01:29:40.873 --> 01:29:44.976
One is a cold-blooded
psychopath

01:29:44.978 --> 01:29:50.885
and the other is a decent kid
that's just had a shitty life.

01:29:53.086 --> 01:29:55.823
Can you explain to me
how you could be both?

01:29:58.158 --> 01:30:00.661
I have a split personality.

01:30:07.134 --> 01:30:10.538
And that's why
you see the shrink.

01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:15.609
I want to go to jail now.

01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:33.461
Are you ready, ma'am?

01:30:59.252 --> 01:31:01.154
Hi, Harley.

01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:06.927
How are you doing?

01:31:08.561 --> 01:31:10.064
Good.

01:31:11.965 --> 01:31:15.567
Are you sleeping?

01:31:15.569 --> 01:31:17.505
I'm fine.

01:31:19.072 --> 01:31:21.007
How are the girls?

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:25.212
They're adjusting.

01:31:26.646 --> 01:31:28.783
Did you get
Jody's letter?

01:31:36.256 --> 01:31:39.691
I came to see
how you were doing.

01:31:39.693 --> 01:31:41.195
I hope that's okay?

01:31:43.863 --> 01:31:45.964
Is it still
part of your job?

01:31:45.966 --> 01:31:48.666
No.

01:31:48.668 --> 01:31:50.704
No, I guess it isn't.

01:31:51.971 --> 01:31:53.907
Then why are you here?

01:31:56.909 --> 01:32:01.245
Because, Harley,
truthfully,

01:32:01.247 --> 01:32:04.182
what you are doing

01:32:04.184 --> 01:32:07.852
is sacrificing yourself
for someone.

01:32:07.854 --> 01:32:09.720
Am I correct?

01:32:09.722 --> 01:32:12.324
Because I have reason
to doubt the account

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:15.093
that you gave
in your statement.

01:32:15.095 --> 01:32:17.329
And because I believe

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:21.665
that even though you have
been through more than most,

01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:24.738
you are not a murderer.

01:32:31.877 --> 01:32:34.111
Is there anything
you want to tell me, Harley?

01:32:34.113 --> 01:32:36.616
Anything at all?

01:32:42.154 --> 01:32:45.158
I thought you came to see me
because you cared about me.

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.626
That's the truth.

01:32:48.628 --> 01:32:51.032
I do care about you.

01:32:52.899 --> 01:32:56.570
But I can't help you
if you won't let me.

01:32:59.972 --> 01:33:02.208
Then I'm sorry
I've wasted your time.

01:33:03.676 --> 01:33:05.777
I know who you are.

01:33:05.779 --> 01:33:08.583
You don't belong here.

01:33:15.255 --> 01:33:16.888
Yes, I do.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:19.324
No!

01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.036
Harley! Harley!

01:33:54.828 --> 01:33:56.428
Dear Harley,

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.830
how are you?

01:33:58.832 --> 01:34:01.398
I am fine.

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.169
Amber and Misty
are fine too.

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:08.305
Uncle Mike let me bring
all my dinosaurs to his house.

01:34:08.307 --> 01:34:10.407
Amber has her own room.

01:34:10.409 --> 01:34:13.911
I still have to share
with Misty.

01:34:13.913 --> 01:34:16.817
I hope you will
come back soon.

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.852
I miss my life.

01:34:20.854 --> 01:34:23.324
Your sister, Jody.
