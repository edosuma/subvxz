BARBIE: A few weeks ago, an invisible
dome crashed down on Chester's Mill

00:06.507 --> 00:08.418
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.924
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.094 --> 00:14.507
we still don 't know.
Every day it tests our limits

00:14.681 --> 00:17.263
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.138
Some say we '/I be stuck here
forever

00:21.939 --> 00:25.682
but we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.100
[SCREAMING]

00:28.529 --> 00:29.769
You killed a 19-year-old girl

00:29.947 --> 00:31.938
- that your nephew loved.
- I had to!

00:32.115 --> 00:34.071
I need to get a message
to someone on the inside.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.076
Why don't you write down what you
wanna say, where you wanna send it?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.487
"So get the egg
and bring it with you."

00:39.957 --> 00:41.572
Oh, my God. He did change it.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.911
- Do you believe me?
- What's my dad want with the egg?

00:44.086 --> 00:46.623
- No one can know about Barbie.
- You're worried about Big Jim.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.378
Without Barbie,
no telling what he'll do.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.710
- Barbie sent you another e-mail.
- He's alive.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.966
MELANIE: So you're gonna jump?
JULIA: He doesn't want me to.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.967
- Don'tjump!
JULIA: Leave him alone!

00:55.138 --> 00:57.299
Barbie!

01:05.232 --> 01:07.894
- Where am I?
- Relax.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.399
You're perfectly safe.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.143
As long as you talk.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.313
Well, I'm happy to,
with my one phone call.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.322
We're not the police.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.653
Or the military.

01:18.161 --> 01:22.370
Got black uniforms, no insignias,
no flag of origin.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.327
That's a violation
of the Geneva convention.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.002
Says the man
who was caught trespassing

01:26.169 --> 01:28.501
in a restricted security zone
with false credentials.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.913
Okay, so charge me or let me go.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.422
National Defense
Authorization Act

01:32.593 --> 01:34.800
says I don't have to charge you
or release you.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.297
I'm not a terrorist.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.928
Prove it. Tell me why you went
to the dome last night.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.302
Go to hell.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.016
We've had our eye on you.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.895
Dale Barbara, Special Forces.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.645
So you know it all.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.651
What else you need from me?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.527
MAN:
How'd you get out of Chester's Mill?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.156
I want the exact route.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.237
"Don'tjump," you said.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.827
Why did you tell that woman,
Julia Shumway, not to jump?

02:06.001 --> 02:09.084
Why do you care
how or why I got out?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.878
Because you're so gung-ho
to save everyone on the inside?

02:12.049 --> 02:13.960
What the hell have you done
to help any of us?

02:17.346 --> 02:19.382
You're going to cooperate.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.178
Including getting Miss Shumway
to hand over that power source.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.727
So this is about that.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.763
You admit you know what it is.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.522
BARBIE:
Yeah.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.984
| just think that you want something
you're never gonna get.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.785
Hold that thought, smart guy.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.958
- Good morning, Julia.
- Hey, Jim.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.993
Enjoying your first day as sheriff?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.708
Oh, yeah. Having a blast.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.249
Never short of trouble these days.
Speaking of which, I was driving by

02:57.427 --> 03:01.420
and I noticed that you got
some company again out there.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.135
Haven't seen guards this close
in weeks.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.550
Any idea what they're doing there?

03:08.647 --> 03:10.012
No.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.435
JIM: So you haven't seen
anything odd lately

03:12.901 --> 03:14.107
outside the dome?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.560
I'm as stumped as you are.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.318
Well, if you do see
anything unusual,

03:21.493 --> 03:23.859
just give me a call on that walkie
I gave you.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.949
Must be hard
getting a sense of closure.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.784
What do you mean?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.995
I mean not getting a chance
to bury Barbie.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.916
When my wife died,
the accident was severe.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.457
There was no viewing.
It was a closed casket.

03:39.136 --> 03:43.470
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is
if you want me to organize a team

03:43.640 --> 03:46.302
to help recover the body,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.051
it'll give you a chance
to say goodbye.

03:52.441 --> 03:56.025
Well, that's kind of you, but I wouldn't
wanna put anyone else in danger.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.152
That's what Barbie was doing for Sam
and look how that turned out.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.985
If you change your mind,
give the sheriff a holler.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.741
Will do.

04:24.890 --> 04:25.970
Do you think he knows?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.381
About Barbie being alive?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.550
He was asking a lot of questions.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.561
Exactly why we have to keep this
to ourselves until we know he's okay.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.938
- He might send another e-mail.
- Doubt they'll let him.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.690
Maybe the guys who took Barbie
are the same ones who want the egg.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.067
How would they know about it?

04:39.237 --> 04:41.398
Question is what would they do
if they got a hold of it?

04:41.573 --> 04:44.736
Well, you wouldn't give the egg
to them. We'll protect it. Right?

04:44.910 --> 04:47.242
Until I know Barbie's safe,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.370
Let's get to the school on the chance
he does get another e-mail through.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.201
That's a good idea.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.996
Listen, I'm gonna head back to the
station and keep an eye on my dad.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.804
Why red? Why a door?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.475
You know, in the Old Testament,

05:09.643 --> 05:12.009
Israelites would paint their doors red
with blood of lambs

05:12.187 --> 05:13.552
as a symbol of sacrifice

05:13.730 --> 05:15.971
so the angel of vengeance
would pass them by.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.390
You're just full of happy stories,
aren't you?

05:18.568 --> 05:19.683
Sam, give him a break.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.479
Art theory 101, a door always
symbolizes a way in somewhere.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.280
Hey, look.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.406
The locker. Right?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.862
In the school?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.993
I went through that
to get out of Chester's Mill.

05:31.540 --> 05:36.250
So this door could be a way back in,
wherever it is.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.504
When I went off the cliff,
I woke up in some kids' playground.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.164
That's exactly what happened to me.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.048
Did you see a red door
at the playground?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.254
Didn't notice.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.591
So if this door
does lead to Chester's Mill,

05:48.765 --> 05:51.051
it could be a way for me to get Junior
and bring him here.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.593
- Think you can bring Jim back too?
- I can't think about that right now.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.059
Let's go to the playground
and see if there's a red door there.

06:00.151 --> 06:04.190
- Where you been, James?
- Just making rounds.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.071
See all that activity
outside the dome?

06:07.284 --> 06:08.444

06:09.786 --> 06:10.821
Yeah, I did.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.987

06:13.623 --> 06:15.454
On the other side.

- Who?
- Barbie.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.253
He's alive.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.213
Did you know?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.714
Yeah, Dad. I did.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.178
Well, thank you
for being honest with me, son.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.139
Now, I need you to keep
being honest with me.

I want you to show me.

So then pull a few more

07:18.396 --> 07:21.559
After the failed missile strike
on the dome a couple weeks ago,

07:21.733 --> 07:24.566
they caught hell from Congress,
the media.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.818
Just trying to distance themselves
from the situation

07:26.988 --> 07:28.774
so they hired private contractors.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.191
Kind of how government hired you to
handle all communication in the dome.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.366
So tell me,
who changed my message to Julia?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.950
Was that you or was that them?

07:39.668 --> 07:40.748
I tried to get it through,

07:40.919 --> 07:42.875
but they caught me
and they strong-armed me.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.298
they insisted that we add the bit
about the egg.

07:48.468 --> 07:53.178
Dad, stop, all right?
Enough. No more lies.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.886
Son, I want you out of those cuffs.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.851
The only way there's a chance
of that happening

08:01.022 --> 08:03.104
is you have to convince Julia
to bring the egg.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.436
It's the only thing that's valuable
enough to trade for your release.

of owning a security firm

08:46.818 --> 08:48.979

You just have to accept it.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.328
Things that seem reckless
to everyone else?

27:55.757 --> 27:57.258
Not everyone gets that.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.383
Not everyone's been in love.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.467
Do you wanna protect it with me
from now on?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.678
I know a place
where we can keep it safe.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.986
- What did you do with it?
- DO with what?

28:23.160 --> 28:25.276
I went to Angie's apartment,
and now the egg is gone.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.739
I think you knew it was there.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.530
Looks like we both got skunked.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.784
Come on.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.412
You know me well enough by now
to tell when I'm lying.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.330
Because the exception is so rare.

28:38.508 --> 28:42.877
Well, I can't really get mad at Rebecca
for flapping her lips at you.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.128
Everybody wants that damn thing.

28:46.850 --> 28:50.763
But I'm trying to protect the town,
not just Barbie.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.230
Barbie?

28:52.397 --> 28:54.012
What does he have to do with this?

28:55.359 --> 28:57.395
We both know Barbie's alive.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.809
Those men have him,

28:58.987 --> 29:01.569
and you were gonna give them
that egg to set him free.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.856
It's a pretty big risk.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.242
Well, I don't expect you
to understand.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.996
Big Jim Rennie doesn't know
what it's like to love anyone

29:11.166 --> 29:12.531
other than himself.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.162
Oh, yeah?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.713
You try telling your boy

29:24.012 --> 29:28.255
that his mom's not gonna be taking
him to the park anymore after school.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.934
In fact, she won't be coming home.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.138
Even

29:39.194 --> 29:42.436
I'm sure losing Pauline
was incredibly hard for both Of you.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.691
I loved my wife
more than you'll ever know.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.241
And I'd give anything
to have her back.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.663
Jim.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.330
Why do you want the egg?

29:57.879 --> 29:59.915
To save this town.

30:00.382 --> 30:03.374
Or maybe it's just
another power play.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.545
Turns out you don't know me
as well as I thought you did.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.222
- You couldn't get anything out of him?
- Nothing.

30:15.564 --> 30:16.644
Any word from the tail?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.101
Actually two blocks away,
he doubled back

30:19.276 --> 30:21.733
and, well, he lost them.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.359
What?

30:23.864 --> 30:25.354
You said this would work.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.148
That he would lead us somewhere
related to where he came out.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.444
I'm trying to reacquire his whereabouts
as fast as possible.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.748
And I got a message
from our field team saying--

30:33.915 --> 30:34.950
- Shut up.
BARBIE: Dad.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.537
I got out. I need your help.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.339
Damn it.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.935
BARBIE [ON RECORDING]:
Dad, [got out. [need your help.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.641
Where's the red door?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.806
It's on a root cellar in the backyard.
Come on.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.600
- Root cellar? What the hell is that?
- Leftover from Prohibition.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.144
Weird coincidence, don't you think?

31:05.322 --> 31:07.313
Way back to Chester's Mill
being on your property?

31:07.491 --> 31:10.608
If you still believe in coincidence,
you're not paying attention.

31:10.786 --> 31:11.901
Come on.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.706
Some guy gave me 10 bucks to come
ring the buzzer and play that for you.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.583
He's a decoy.
Get him the hell out of here.

31:20.754 --> 31:23.461
Have the grounds searched now.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.958
We may have a breach.
Search the property.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.653
That's mine.
From the day it was painted.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.944
All right, come on.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.369
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.292
MAN 1:
Gotta check, they were here.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.622
MAN 2:
Come on!

32:03.797 --> 32:05.082
Come on, we gotta go.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.164
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. I--

32:07.342 --> 32:10.129
MAN 1: Over by the dam!
- Either you go or you get caught.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.259
- It's your choice.
MAN 1: All the way back there.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.762
- All the way back.
MAN 2: See anything?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.191
BARBIE: Tunnel that led us
from Chester's Mill

32:27.362 --> 32:28.977
was hidden behind a locker
or something.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.021
Is that it?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.325
That wasn't there before.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.198
Help me move some of these.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.712
All right. Let's go.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.376
Come on.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.211
Ah-ah-ah.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.054
Look, I appreciate
all your help getting us here.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.964
But I'm telling you,
you don't wanna do this.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.679
I got nobody here except Pauline.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.845
And you think your dad's gonna
give me a promotion if he catches me?

33:04.399 --> 33:05.639
All right, go.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.281
What are you looking for?

33:57.452 --> 33:58.612
Oh, hey, kiddo.

33:58.787 --> 34:01.654
I'm just looking
for some of your mom's things.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.243
Things to take with us?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.702
"Take with us?"

34:06.795 --> 34:09.127
Please don't leave me here
with my dad.

34:09.506 --> 34:11.622
Oh, James.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.296
Your dad's gonna take good care
Of you. Don't worry about that.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.094
The way he took good care of Mom?

34:20.642 --> 34:24.931
I'm sorry, buddy,
I can't take you with me.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.721
Then Mom lied.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.355
About what?

34:29.526 --> 34:31.938
JUNIOR: She said you were going
to save me one day.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.360
I was hoping that was today.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.428
Now it'll be there forever.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.714
SO one day you'll see it

35:01.891 --> 35:03.631
and remember
how little you used to be.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.017
Will you come back
before I grow big?

35:06.479 --> 35:07.559
I hope so.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.815
Why are you only here today?

35:11.985 --> 35:16.024
I don't know,
but my mom wanted me to meet you.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.028
And I'll see you again one day.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.023
Promise.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.764
What the hell?

35:48.938 --> 35:50.189
We're back somehow.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.765
- Where's the others?
- Pauline?

35:57.822 --> 36:00.564
I don't know about this, Lyle.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.533
Sam?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.081
Lyle?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.715
Melanie?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.516
Melanie?

36:36.069 --> 36:37.684
This is where it began.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.239
And this is where it ends.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.772
For all of us.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.609
I don't understand.
Tell me what you mean.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.841
- Hey, you guys okay?
- Yeah.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.138
- Where's Lyle?
- He was ahead of me.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.796
Oh, my God,
what if he didn't make it?

37:06.975 --> 37:08.431
Come on.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.200
Hey, coming through,

37:32.667 --> 37:34.453
did any of you guys see stuff?

37:34.627 --> 37:36.959
- I couldn't see crap.
- I did.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.337
- Like a memory.
- Mine was like a premonition.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.294
Lyle should've been there, but he
wasn't. Stay here and wait for him.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.209
- Where are you going?
- To get my son.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.627
BARBIE:
I'm gonna go find Julia.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.296
Everybody needs to keep
a low profile, all right?

37:48.475 --> 37:50.261
Anyone in this town sees
that we're back,

37:50.435 --> 37:52.016
and it's gonna cause chaos.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.269
Once I come up with a plan,
I'll find you.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.268
Hunter, stay out of trouble.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.265
Lay low.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.026
I'm coming with you.
I wanna see Junior.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.404
No. I have to do this alone.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.940
You need to stay here
and find Lyle, please.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.951
Now that we're back, whatever's
gonna happen, we need Lyle.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.454
I can't believe I made it through.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.037
Now I'm really here in Chester's Mill.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.294
Buckle up, kid.
It's about to get a lot weirder.

38:27.180 --> 38:31.014
No better place to hide
than right under my dad's nose.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.888
It's so peaceful down here.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.019
We should get going.

38:38.775 --> 38:43.018
Can we just lie here
for a little while?

38:44.239 --> 38:46.571
Enjoy the peacefulness?

38:49.953 --> 38:52.615
It would help me feel less alone.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.939
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

40:23.588 --> 40:25.169
Paane?
