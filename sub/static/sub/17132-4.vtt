WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:06.707
AS AN ACCESSORY TO A ROBBERY

00:06.707 --> 00:12.180
HER BOYFRIEND COMMITTED
30 YEARS AGO. THANK YOU.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.248
THE DEFENSE RESTS.

00:14.248 --> 00:17.218
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.220
ONCE YOU'VE REACHED
YOUR VERDICT,

00:19.220 --> 00:21.689
PLEASE INFORM THE BAILIFF.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.923
BAILIFF!

00:22.923 --> 00:26.160
CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE
WITH MY MOTHER, PLEASE...

00:26.160 --> 00:30.431
SO THAT WE MAY PRAY
THAT GAYS CAN MARRY?

00:32.266 --> 00:34.135
I'M WORKING
ON JUROR NUMBER FOUR.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.669
HELLO.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.908
I'M NOT WORRIED,
BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND

00:40.908 --> 00:43.644
THE JUROR WHO'S GONNA
ACQUIT ME--NUMBER EIGHT.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.013
THE OLD GUY
WITH THE WATERY EYES?

00:46.013 --> 00:48.316
WELL,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIS EYES,

00:48.316 --> 00:50.318
BUT HIS MOUTH WAS WATERING
WHEN I BENT OVER

00:50.318 --> 00:54.188
AND GAVE HIM A SHOT
OF EXHIBITS "A" AND "B."

00:54.188 --> 00:55.523
OH, MY GOD, MOM.

00:55.523 --> 00:59.127
YOU'RE GONNA HANG
LIKE EXHIBITS "A" AND "B."

00:59.127 --> 01:00.928
I GIVE YOU CREDIT,
BENNY.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.030
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE JOKES
IF 12 STRANGERS

01:03.030 --> 01:05.433
WERE ABOUT TO DECIDE
WHETHER OR NOT I GO TO PRISON.

01:05.433 --> 01:09.270
YEAH, WELL,
I'M TOUGHER THAN YOU. WHO KNEW?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.305
LISTEN, UM, COULD YOU GO GET ME

01:11.305 --> 01:13.607
A CANDY BAR
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE?

01:13.607 --> 01:17.044
GEORGE,
WHAT IF THEY CONVICT ME?

01:17.044 --> 01:19.313
I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T WORRIED.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.282
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
THE PRINCESS TO HEAR.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.285
MOM, I KNOW IT'S HARD TO WAIT,
BUT THE LAWYER SAID

01:24.285 --> 01:27.087
THAT THE LONGER THE JURY'S OUT,
THE BETTER FOR YOU.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.357
IT MEANS SOMEONE IN THERE
IS FIGHTING FOR YOU.
THE JURY'S BACK!

01:31.325 --> 01:33.227
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.595
GEORGE!

01:34.595 --> 01:36.897
LOOK, MOM. LOOK,
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.868
KEEP THE PRISON VAN HERE.
I GOT ONE MORE COMING.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.339
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE TROUBLING.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.610
EVERYONE,
PLEASE BE SEATED.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.445
(gavel bangs)

01:51.445 --> 01:54.047
MR. FOREMAN, HAS THE JURY
COME TO A DECISION?

01:54.047 --> 01:57.851
OH, YEAH, IN THE HALL,
ON THE WAY TO THE JURY ROOM.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.787
HOW DO YOU FIND?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.223
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT,
BENITA LOPEZ, GUILTY AS CHARGED.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.195
SO SAYS THE JURY.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.330
WHAT?! THIS IS CRAZY!

02:09.330 --> 02:11.332
NOW THERE ARE MURDERERS
AND RAPISTS

02:11.332 --> 02:13.334
RUNNING AROUND LOOSE
ON THE STREETS,

02:13.334 --> 02:15.536
AND YOU
ARE GONNA PUT ME IN JAIL?

02:15.536 --> 02:19.540
YOU ARE THE 12 DUMBEST PEOPLE
I'VE EVER SEEN!
MOM.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.408
WHAT?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.810
THEY'RE STILL SENTENCING.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.348
I'M SORRY I SHOUTED.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.150
IT'S THE HORMONES.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.585
I'M PREGNANT.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.460
DON'T MAKE ME
HAVE MY BABY IN JAIL.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.565
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

02:47.401 --> 02:50.538
* ALL MY FRIENDS

02:50.538 --> 02:52.240
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

02:52.240 --> 02:55.309
**

03:03.351 --> 03:04.852
(knock on door)

03:06.587 --> 03:08.956
WELL,
THAT WAS A SETBACK.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.960
SETBACK? MY MOM'S
LOOKING AT HARD TIME.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.628
OH, NOT NECESSARILY, GEORGE.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.498
IF WE CAN SHOW YOUR MOM
IN A SYMPATHETIC LIGHT,

03:17.498 --> 03:19.433
MAYBE WE CAN
GET HER PROBATION,

03:19.433 --> 03:23.737
BUT WE NEED CHARACTER WITNESSES
TO SPEAK WELL OF BENNY.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.651
CAN WE HIRE ACTORS?

03:39.253 --> 03:42.856
I'M ASSUMING YOU'LL SPEAK ABOUT
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER SHE WAS.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.659
CAN WE HIRE ACTORS?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.995
WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE?
EVEN IF THE JURY

03:47.995 --> 03:51.064
WANTS TO SEND HER TO PRISON,
CAN'T THEY BE OVERRULED?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.866
YES, BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

03:52.866 --> 03:57.204
I HAVE A PROBLEMATIC HISTORY
WITH JUDGE ALVAREZ.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.640
AS YOU YOUNG PEOPLE SAY...

03:59.640 --> 04:04.345
I HIT IT
AND PROCEEDED TO QUIT IT.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.254
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL--I'LL SPEAK FOR MY MOM.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.256
SO WILL I.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.625
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.026
OH. I'D LOVE TO HELP,

04:19.026 --> 04:21.028
BUT I DON'T REALLY
KNOW BENNY THAT WELL.

04:21.028 --> 04:25.098
NOW IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO JUST
SIT ON THE STAND AND LOOK HOT,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.934
I CAN DO THAT.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.837
WELL, THAT'S A CHEAP
AND OBVIOUS MOVE.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.606
LET'S TRY IT.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.675
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES HERE,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.678
SO WHAT ELSE CAN I DO
TO HELP MY MOM?

04:37.678 --> 04:39.680
YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL

04:39.680 --> 04:43.116
IF ONE OF HER PARENTS
TESTIFIED.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.418
ARE THEY ALIVE?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.020
HER MOM IS.
I'LL TRACK HER DOWN.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.722
BUT THEY HAVEN'T TALKED
FOR 40 YEARS.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.724
BENNY'S PARENTS
KICKED HER OUT

04:50.724 --> 04:51.992
WHEN SHE GOT PREGNANT
WITH GEORGE.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.395
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S OLDER NOW.

04:54.395 --> 04:58.932
MAYBE SHE WANTS TO MAKE UP
WITH BENNY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.668
WELL, THEN... AHEM.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.803
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? I'LL JUST
TURN ON THE LOPEZ CHARM.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.105
YOU SEE, I CAN GET A WOMAN
TO DO ANYTHING.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.108
I GOT YOU TO GO OUT WITH ME
IN HIGH SCHOOL, DIDN'T I?

05:08.108 --> 05:12.813
I WENT OUT WITH YOU
BECAUSE I FELT SORRY FOR YOU.

05:14.715 --> 05:18.952
NOT IN FRONT OF COMPANY!
YOU NEVER BACK ME UP.

05:22.790 --> 05:27.227
HEY, DID MY GRANDMA CALL?
YEAH. SHE HIT TRAFFIC,
BUT SHE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.762
DAD,
WHAT'S YOUR GRANDMA LIKE?

05:28.762 --> 05:31.365
I DON'T KNOW, MAX.
I ONLY HEARD MY MOM'S STORIES.

05:31.365 --> 05:35.035
SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE OLD SCHOOL.
OH! GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE,
TELL 'EM ABOUT THE TIME

05:35.035 --> 05:37.738
THAT BENNY GOT IN TROUBLE
WITH THE NUNS. (chuckles)

05:37.738 --> 05:40.741
OH, YEAH, ONE DAY MY MOM
MOUTHED OFF IN CLASS,

05:40.741 --> 05:42.743
AND THE NUNS HIT HER
WITH A RULER.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.745
THEY WERE LIKE THAT...
(speaks Spanish)

05:44.745 --> 05:47.214
THEN WHEN SHE GOT HOME AND HER
MOM FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED,

05:47.214 --> 05:49.717
SHE HIT HER WITH A SWITCH.
SHE WAS LIKE THAT...

05:49.717 --> 05:52.085
MOVE YOUR HAND.
MOVE YOUR HAND.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.955
THEN HER DAD CAME HOME
AND BEAT HER MOM

05:54.955 --> 05:57.658
BECAUSE DINNER WAS LATE.

06:00.327 --> 06:03.597
THAT'S HORRIBLE.
DID ANYONE BEAT HIM?

06:03.597 --> 06:06.867
TEQUILA
AND A CURVE IN THE FREEWAY.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.475
MAX,
GO WASH UP FOR DINNER.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.510
(car door closes)

06:16.510 --> 06:18.512
UH-OH, SHE'S HERE!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:18.512 --> 06:19.747
I'M GONNA
GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.517
HEY.
YOU DON'T WANNA MEET HER?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.586
DUDE,
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO BENNY!

06:27.988 --> 06:30.958
HOW BAD CAN SHE BE?
I MEAN, SHE MUST HAVE MELLOWED

06:30.958 --> 06:33.961
IF SHE CAME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE TO HELP BENNY.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.865
ACTUALLY, I TOLD HER
THAT MY MOM WAS SHOT.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.102
YOU LIED TO HER?

06:42.102 --> 06:45.138
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA USE
THE LOPEZ CHARM.
IT DIDN'T WORK.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.041
I CAN'T DO MY PUPPY DOG EYES
OVER THE PHONE.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.010
I'D BE LIKE THAT...

06:50.010 --> 06:54.114
(knock on door)

06:54.114 --> 06:56.049
GRANDMA.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.918
HERE.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.253
IT'S GREAT
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.824
IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT TOOK
MY MOM BEING IN THE HOSPITAL

07:03.824 --> 07:07.628
TO FINALLY
BRING US TOGETHER.
I'M HIS WIFE ANGIE.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.663
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:09.663 --> 07:13.233
YEAH, YOU, TOO.
SO HOW'S BENNY DOING?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.435
UH, SHE'S
IN A... A SEMIPRIVATE ROOM,

07:15.435 --> 07:18.138
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE
WATCHING HER,

07:18.138 --> 07:19.907
LIKE, 24 HOURS A DAY.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.044
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.647
YOU RUSHED ME OFF THE PHONE
BEFORE I COULD ASK.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
SHE WROTE YOU A LETTER
ASKING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS,

07:28.716 --> 07:30.884
AND THEN SHE WENT
TO THE POST OFFICE TO MAIL IT.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.954
THEN A POSTAL WORKER
WHO HAD JUST BEEN FIRED--

07:33.954 --> 07:36.824
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT MAKES SENSE--

07:36.824 --> 07:38.826
SHOT UP THE PLACE,
GRANDMA.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.529
ALL RIGHT. SO, UH,
WE'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL

07:41.529 --> 07:43.531
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.533
I FIGURED YOU'D BE
TOO EXHAUSTED TO COOK,

07:45.533 --> 07:47.835
SO I BROUGHT
SOME HOMEMADE TAMALES.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.638
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HER THE TRUTH?

07:50.638 --> 07:54.542
IF YOU COULD COOK,
I'D TELL HER RIGHT NOW.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.780
I'M GONNA GET
SOME TAMALES FIRST.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.682
GEORGE,
ISN'T THERE SOME NEWS

08:01.682 --> 08:05.218
YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR GRANDMA
BEFORE YOU EAT?

08:11.224 --> 08:14.094
YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD TELL HER NOW.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.031
TELL ME WHAT?

08:18.031 --> 08:21.168
YOU KNOW HOW GRANDMAS
ARE SUPPOSED TO SPOIL YOU

08:21.168 --> 08:22.970
AND--AND GIVE YOU CANDY

08:22.970 --> 08:26.373
AND--AND, UH,
AND FORGIVE YOU WHEN YOU LIE?

08:26.373 --> 08:30.010
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.212
OKAY. I LIED.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.616
MY MOM DIDN'T GET SHOT. I JUST
SAID THAT TO GET YOU DOWN HERE.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.685
SHE--SHE'S IN JAIL.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.287
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE?!

08:40.287 --> 08:41.989
LET'S SEE.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.325
YOU OWE ME 100 BUCKS
FOR THE GAS,

08:45.325 --> 08:49.362
30 BUCKS FOR THE TAMALES
THAT I BOUGHT DOWN THE STREET.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.765
MY MOM NEEDS YOUR HELP.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.767
IF YOU SAY SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT HER

08:53.767 --> 08:55.703
AT HER SENTENCING HEARING
TOMORROW,

08:55.703 --> 08:57.971
SHE MIGHT NOT
HAVE TO GO TO PRISON.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.007
AND 12 BUCKS
FOR THE SALSA VERDE.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.409
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A LOT
TO MAKE UP FOR, TOO,

09:02.409 --> 09:04.912
YOU KNOW, WITH THE--WITH
THE BEATINGS AND EVERYTHING.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.915
(scoffs) I NEVER
LAID A HAND ON BENNY.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.483
IF ANYTHING,
WE WERE MUCH TOO EASY ON HER,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.352
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE GOT PREGNANT AND RAN AWAY.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.454
WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE SAID YOU KICKED HER OUT.

09:14.454 --> 09:18.225
OH, KICKED HER--SHE LEFT
ON HER OWN, AND MY HUSBAND--

09:18.225 --> 09:20.060
MAY HE REST IN PEACE--

09:20.060 --> 09:23.631
NEVER GOT OVER THE SHAME
THAT SHE BROUGHT ON THIS FAMILY.

09:23.631 --> 09:29.970
(chuckles)
WELL, AS THE SHAME...

09:33.907 --> 09:38.078
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
FOR A FAVOR.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.213
LOOK, I'VE HAD MY OWN PROBLEMS
WITH MY MOM,

09:40.213 --> 09:43.216
BUT I'M GONNA SUCK IT UP AND SAY
SOMETHING NICE ON THE STAND,

09:43.216 --> 09:45.986
AND I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO DO THE SAME.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.256
THIS COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE UP WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.928
I'LL DO IT. IF YOU CAN GET PAST
WHAT SHE DID TO YOU,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.965
I CAN GET PAST
MY OWN PROBLEMS.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.199
THANK YOU.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.333
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,

10:00.333 --> 10:03.036
THAT GIRL HAS CAUSED US BOTH
A LOT OF GRIEF.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
AMEN, GRANNY.
DON'T EAT THOSE.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.041
I'M SURE YOU WONDER WHAT IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

10:08.041 --> 10:10.678
IF THAT OTHER FAMILY
HAD KEPT YOU. (clicks tongue)

10:15.315 --> 10:16.717
WHAT OTHER FAMILY?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.986
THE ONE SHE TRIED
TO GIVE YOU AWAY TO.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.854
UH-OH.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.856
NO, YOU MEAN MY SISTER,
RIGHT?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.125
SHE TRIED
TO GIVE MY SISTER AWAY.

10:25.125 --> 10:29.396
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE GAVE YOU AWAY FIRST...

10:29.396 --> 10:32.032
BUT THE FAMILY RETURNED YOU.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.009
HONEY...

10:42.009 --> 10:46.279
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU, BUT...

10:46.279 --> 10:47.981
I HAVE TO SAY,

10:47.981 --> 10:51.151
YOUR LIFE IS
REALLY JACKED UP.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.658
DID YOU REACH YOUR MOM?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.328
NO, THE JAIL WOULDN'T
PUT MY CALL THROUGH.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
HONEY,
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL UPSET

11:03.330 --> 11:05.565
ABOUT BENNY
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AWAY,

11:05.565 --> 11:08.769
BUT I HOPE THAT'S NOT GONNA
INFLUENCE YOUR TESTIMONY.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.004
YOU KNOW,
JUST A LITTLE AT THE END.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.007
"SO I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER
SHOULD GO TO PRISON

11:14.007 --> 11:15.943
"FOR AN OLD ROBBERY CHARGE

11:15.943 --> 11:18.879
"WHEN HER REAL CRIME
WAS GIVING AWAY HER ONLY SON.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.014
I HATE HER!
I HATE HER SO MUCH!"

11:22.549 --> 11:26.419
"THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY."

11:26.419 --> 11:29.422
GEORGE, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT TO YOUR MOM.

11:29.422 --> 11:33.560
YES, SHE TRIED TO GIVE YOU AWAY,
BUT SHE DID RAISE YOU.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.929
BECAUSE SHE
WAS STUCK WITH ME.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.931
SHE NEVER WANTED ME, ANGIE.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.468
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO FEEL UNWANTED?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.737
NO, I DON'T.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.577
I'VE BEEN WANTED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

11:50.577 --> 11:54.014
THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET
TO HAVE ME ARE DISAPPOINTED,

11:54.014 --> 11:56.483
AND I HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THAT.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.389
OKAY, IT'S NOT THE SAME.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.558
BUT, GEORGE,
YOU CAN'T GET ON THAT STAND

12:05.558 --> 12:06.927
AND CONDEMN BENNY.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I CAN GO UP THERE

12:08.929 --> 12:11.765
AND SAY ANYTHING NICE
ABOUT HER--NOT NOW.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.836
BUT--BUT, HONEY,
I KNOW SHE HURT YOU,

12:15.836 --> 12:19.172
BUT THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.142
I DON'T WANNA BE
THE BIGGER PERSON!

12:24.377 --> 12:28.615
I WANNA BE SMALL AND MEAN,
LIKE A SCORPION.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.951
I'LL BE LIKE THAT...

12:32.953 --> 12:37.724
AND I GET YOU
ALL DISTRACTED BY MY PINCERS.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.592
OH, BUT YOU FORGOT
ABOUT MY TAIL.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.996
WAAPAHH!

12:42.996 --> 12:45.999
DON'T YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
CONSUMED BY YOUR OWN ANGER?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.001
AND--AND WHEN YOU STING HER,

12:48.001 --> 12:51.271
YOUR TAIL IS GONNA FALL OFF,
AND YOU'LL DIE.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.107
THAT'S A BEE!
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING. I WIN.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.682
HELLO, BENITA.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.819
MOM?

13:05.819 --> 13:09.222
(whispers)
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
SHE'S GONNA TESTIFY FOR YOU.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.625
SHE IS THE LAST PERSON
WHO WOULD WANT TO HELP ME.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.562
(chuckles)

13:18.765 --> 13:21.034
I WOULDN'T SAY "THE LAST."

13:21.034 --> 13:23.904
(gavel bangs)

13:23.904 --> 13:26.539
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET STARTED.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.675
THE DEFENSE MAY CALL
ITS FIRST CHARACTER WITNESS...

13:28.675 --> 13:33.947
OR MAYBE HE'D RATHER
SEND AN E-MAIL TWO WEEKS LATER

13:33.947 --> 13:36.249
TO LET HER KNOW IT'S OVER.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.526
MY CLIENT
HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY,

13:46.526 --> 13:50.563
BUT I KNOW THAT ONCE
YOU HEAR FROM HER LOVED ONES,

13:50.563 --> 13:53.433
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HER
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.437
I THINK HER SON, GEORGE LOPEZ,
WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.372
PASS.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.112
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:05.112 --> 14:08.315
PASS, VATO.
I GOT NOTHING TO SAY. ADJOURNED.

14:08.315 --> 14:14.587
OKAY, WE CALL LUISA DIAZ,
THE DEFENDANT'S MOTHER.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.726
MRS. DIAZ, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TELL THE COURT

14:19.726 --> 14:22.362
SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.497
BENITA WAS SMART
AND HARDWORKING.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.634
SO SHE HAD TO QUIT SCHOOL
AND GO TO WORK

14:27.634 --> 14:29.369
TO HELP SUPPORT THE FAMILY.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.671
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE NEVER HELPED US.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.641
SHE HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL
BECAUSE SHE GOT KNOCKED UP.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.647
AND IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE
TO KEEP THE CHILD

14:40.647 --> 14:42.682
AND RAISE IT ON HER OWN.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.185
HA!

14:47.354 --> 14:48.821
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.959
THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT SHE MADE
WHEN SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE HOME.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.661
WHAT?
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.663
I HAD TO LEAVE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,

14:56.663 --> 14:59.299
STAY THERE
AND LET YOU HIT ME SOME MORE?

14:59.299 --> 15:00.500
(gavel bangs)
ORDER.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.569
WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO TWIST THINGS?

15:02.569 --> 15:05.672
WE SPANKED YOU,
SOMETIMES IN THE FACE.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.080
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT!

15:13.080 --> 15:15.082
WELL, YOU GOT
WHAT YOU DESERVED

15:15.082 --> 15:17.384
FOR RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A LITTLE WHORE!

15:17.384 --> 15:20.053
(gavel bangs)
(Judge Alvarez) ORDER!

15:21.421 --> 15:23.656
I TOLD YOU NEVER
TO CALL ME THAT.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.159
THEN YOU SHOULD
NEVER HAVE ACTED LIKE ONE.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.696
I KNEW YOU WOULD END UP
LIKE THIS--WORTHLESS!

15:35.335 --> 15:40.040
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN STEP DOWN NOW.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.382
I CHANGED MY MIND.
GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.151
WHY NOT?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.324
I WASN'T GONNA
COME UP HERE TODAY, BUT...

15:57.324 --> 16:00.327
NOW I FEEL I HAVE TO.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.765
MY MOM MAY HAVE MADE SOME...
MISTAKES IN HER LIFE,

16:05.765 --> 16:09.102
BUT WHEN SOMEONE LIKE THAT
RAISES YOU...

16:09.102 --> 16:11.171
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.639
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE PUNISHED

16:12.639 --> 16:16.509
FOR A STUPID DECISION
SHE MADE A LONG TIME AGO.

16:19.046 --> 16:22.349
SHE'S NEVER
COMMITTED ANOTHER CRIME.

16:22.349 --> 16:27.054
SHE'S WORKED AT THE SAME JOB
FOR 30 YEARS.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.822
SO I'M ASKING YOU...

16:29.822 --> 16:31.658
AS HER SON...

16:35.795 --> 16:38.765
DON'T SEND MY MOM TO PRISON.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.878
(whispers) THANKS, GEORGE.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.480
YEAH.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.125
YOUR TESTIMONY
HELPED A LOT.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.560
I, UH, GOT PROBATION,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.197
COUPLE OF HUNDRED HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE...

17:10.197 --> 17:13.233
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PICK UP
TRASH ON THE FREEWAY.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.235
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.504
WHICH ONE?
MAYBE I'LL RUN INTO YOU.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.975
ANGIE TOLD ME
WHAT MY MOM SAID.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.977
I KNOW YOU GOT
SOME CRYING TO DO,

17:24.977 --> 17:26.779
SO LET'S JUST GET IT
OVER WITH. GO.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.282
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.185
YOU KNOW, I'LL SEE YOU
AT WORK TOMORROW, BENNY.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.355
"BENNY"?
SO I'M NOT YOUR MOM ANYMORE?

17:35.355 --> 17:38.858
HEY, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE
MY MOM WHEN YOU GAVE ME AWAY.

17:38.858 --> 17:42.462
I GOT YOU BACK.
I-I-I BEGGED FOR YOU.

17:44.097 --> 17:47.134
LOOK, AFTER A WEEK,

17:47.134 --> 17:51.704
THE FAMILY GAVE YOU BACK
AND GOT A PUPPY INSTEAD.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.607
YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, DID YOU?

17:54.607 --> 17:58.278
HERE. I STOPPED AT THE HOUSE
AND GOT THIS.
WHAT'S THIS?

17:58.278 --> 18:01.281
IT'S AN AGREEMENT
THAT I MADE WITH THE DELGADOS,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.283
THE FAMILY THAT TOOK YOU.

18:03.283 --> 18:08.288
"RAISE HIM
AS IF HE WERE YOUR OWN.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.057
"TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.994
HUG HIM EVERY DAY AND MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE HE'S SPECIAL."

18:14.994 --> 18:17.630
I HAD CONDITIONS, GEORGE.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.266
WHAT--WHAT'S THIS?

18:19.266 --> 18:22.402
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU TRIED
TO WHITE SOMETHING OUT.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.871
NO, NO, NO. I DIDN'T.
GIVE IT BACK.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.341
700, 600, 500,
WHAT IS THIS?!

18:28.341 --> 18:31.644
WE WERE NEGOTIATING.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.215
YOU SOLD ME?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.152
EH, WHAT DID THEY PAY
FOR THE PUPPY?

18:39.152 --> 18:45.425
NOW, GEORGE, UH, THAT DOG CAME
FROM A LONG LINE OF CHAMPIONS.

18:48.995 --> 18:52.399
SO I'M WORTH
LESS THAN A DOG.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.667
NOT JUST ANY DOG, GEORGE--

18:54.667 --> 18:57.504
A CHAMPIONSHIP DOG.

18:59.005 --> 19:04.744
LOOK, THEY OFFERED ME THE MONEY.
IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.248
I WAS 16,
AND I WAS SCARED, AND...

19:08.248 --> 19:11.418
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A BETTER LIFE.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.254
WELL,
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU DO

19:14.254 --> 19:17.824
THE THINGS YOU ASKED
THE OTHER FAMILY TO DO?!

19:17.824 --> 19:21.127
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD DO IT.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.230
YOU SAW MY MOM.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.898
SHE WASN'T EXACTLY
A GREAT TEACHER

19:25.898 --> 19:27.900
WHEN SOMEBODY
NEEDED TO FEEL SPECIAL.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.405
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.509
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I DID.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.481
GOOD TO MEET YOU,
GEORGE.

19:41.481 --> 19:45.218
AND I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
AT YOUR NEXT TRIAL, HUH?

19:49.989 --> 19:53.793
NOT UNLESS I SEE YOU
AT YOUR FUNERAL FIRST.

19:55.562 --> 19:59.098
I'VE OUTLIVED YOUR FATHER
AND YOUR BROTHER.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.569
WE'LL SEE WHO'S NEXT.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.909
DAMN, I THINK SOME FLOWERS DIED
WHEN SHE WALKED BY 'EM.

20:17.450 --> 20:22.522
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE YOU DID DO... BETTER.

20:22.522 --> 20:26.459
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT WORK, MOM.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.796
HEY. YOU CALLED ME "MOM."

20:29.796 --> 20:31.598
HOORAY. I'M BACK.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.233
AND NOW I SUPPOSE
YOU WANT A HUG AND...

20:34.233 --> 20:36.303
SAY "I LOVE YOU"...

20:36.303 --> 20:38.705
NO. YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED THAT.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.413
HEY, MAX, UH...

20:50.817 --> 20:53.586
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.688
OKAY.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.131
SAY IT BACK,

21:05.131 --> 21:09.068
OR NEXT TIME WE DO IT
IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.338
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.405
ALL RIGHT.

21:12.405 --> 21:16.042
COME ON, MAN. HUG ME.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.477
GIVE ME A HUG.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.548
COME ON.
HUG ME LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

21:21.548 --> 21:31.491
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
I'LL TRADE YOU FOR A PUPPY.
