<i>Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.</i>

04:27.388 --> 04:29.481
<i>There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.</i>

04:34.228 --> 04:35.490
They didn't leave a name.

04:35.696 --> 04:37.596
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

05:15.169 --> 05:17.296
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

05:17.638 --> 05:21.199
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

05:21.409 --> 05:24.435
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

05:26.881 --> 05:31.284
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

05:31.485 --> 05:33.112
You don't like my smile?

05:33.821 --> 05:35.686
I don't like what's behind it.

05:36.257 --> 05:40.751
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

05:40.961 --> 05:44.829
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

05:45.266 --> 05:48.201
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

05:48.736 --> 05:50.135
I'll bring you some popcorn.

07:03.577 --> 07:07.069
<i>Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

07:07.281 --> 07:09.909
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

07:15.022 --> 07:17.013
You sent me this?

07:19.093 --> 07:20.754
Who are you?

07:22.062 --> 07:24.929
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

07:25.166 --> 07:28.033
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

07:28.235 --> 07:30.533
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

07:30.738 --> 07:32.831
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which...

07:33.040 --> 07:35.634
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

07:37.144 --> 07:39.112
Yes, I...

07:39.747 --> 07:41.442
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

07:42.983 --> 07:46.976
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

07:47.188 --> 07:51.249
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

07:51.459 --> 07:55.987
<i>It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."</i>

07:56.197 --> 07:59.564
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.827
The things we were made
to do there...

08:03.070 --> 08:05.129
Terrible things.

08:07.007 --> 08:10.534
<i>- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

08:13.247 --> 08:15.238
<i>Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?</i>

08:15.449 --> 08:17.314
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

08:17.518 --> 08:19.213
Yes.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.146
Don't you see?

08:21.522 --> 08:25.151
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

08:25.526 --> 08:26.959
Me.

08:27.461 --> 08:29.861
He's coming for me.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.826
Who? Who's coming?

08:36.169 --> 08:37.330
Totenkopf.

08:38.105 --> 08:39.732
It's Totenkopf.

09:07.034 --> 09:08.558
There!

09:12.239 --> 09:14.230
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

09:14.441 --> 09:17.342
<i>New York City
must be evacuated at once.</i>

09:17.545 --> 09:20.878
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.</i>

09:21.081 --> 09:24.847
<i>All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty</i>

09:25.052 --> 09:28.579
<i>shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.</i>

09:28.789 --> 09:30.188
<i>This is urgent.</i>

09:37.965 --> 09:39.592
<i>- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

09:39.800 --> 09:41.995
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

09:42.202 --> 09:43.931
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.</i>

09:44.138 --> 09:47.938
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

09:48.142 --> 09:49.439
and someone named Totenkopf.

09:49.643 --> 09:52.578
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.645
Totenkopf. Who is he?

09:54.848 --> 09:56.611
<i>He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.</i>

09:56.817 --> 09:58.478
Quick as you can.

09:58.686 --> 10:00.813
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

10:01.021 --> 10:03.114
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

10:03.324 --> 10:04.621
and get the hell out of there.

10:04.825 --> 10:06.452
Wait a minute.

10:07.628 --> 10:11.564
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.498
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

10:15.135 --> 10:16.830
Fifth Avenue.

10:17.037 --> 10:20.370
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.

10:20.608 --> 10:22.735
Polly. Polly!

10:23.811 --> 10:25.472
Oh, my God.

10:25.679 --> 10:26.976
Polly!

10:27.181 --> 10:28.148
Polly!

10:28.682 --> 10:30.149
<i>Polly!</i>

10:33.887 --> 10:35.445
Stop! Come back!

11:11.058 --> 11:12.457
Fire!

11:22.102 --> 11:23.660
Get out of here!

11:23.871 --> 11:26.601
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

11:26.807 --> 11:27.796
Send everything you've got!

11:28.108 --> 11:32.670
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.372
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

11:37.017 --> 11:39.815
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

11:40.020 --> 11:42.511
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

11:42.723 --> 11:45.283
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

11:45.492 --> 11:48.120
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

11:48.328 --> 11:51.661
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

11:52.833 --> 11:55.927
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

11:56.136 --> 11:59.572
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

15:27.915 --> 15:29.314
Polly.

15:32.686 --> 15:34.119
Joe.

15:44.464 --> 15:46.329
<i>Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.</i>

15:48.101 --> 15:50.729
<i>The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication</i>

15:50.938 --> 15:53.532
<i>due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.</i>

15:53.740 --> 15:56.641
<i>Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies</i>

15:56.843 --> 16:00.074
<i>now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:03.477
<i>The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

16:03.684 --> 16:05.049
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

16:05.252 --> 16:08.881
<i>by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.</i>

16:09.089 --> 16:13.219
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

16:13.427 --> 16:14.655
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

16:14.861 --> 16:18.695
<i>robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

16:19.266 --> 16:22.997
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,</i>

16:23.203 --> 16:25.194
<i>world leaders
must once again call upon</i>

16:25.405 --> 16:29.307
<i>the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

16:29.509 --> 16:33.946
<i>to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.</i>

17:22.762 --> 17:23.730
Where's Dex?

18:10.010 --> 18:12.240
Shazam.

18:29.463 --> 18:33.194
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

18:33.700 --> 18:37.534
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

18:37.871 --> 18:39.839
Oh, I need to show you something.

18:41.308 --> 18:44.300
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

18:44.611 --> 18:47.546
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

18:50.984 --> 18:52.884
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

18:53.086 --> 18:54.815
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

18:55.021 --> 18:57.512
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

18:57.724 --> 18:59.783
I think it's being used
to control them.

18:59.993 --> 19:01.654
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

19:02.028 --> 19:03.461
I can try, yeah.

19:03.663 --> 19:04.960
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.692
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

19:08.902 --> 19:11.234
Find out what makes it tick.

19:12.305 --> 19:15.206
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

19:15.809 --> 19:19.506
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

19:24.084 --> 19:29.386
<i>Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.</i>

19:56.249 --> 19:57.375
Tummy ache?

20:02.055 --> 20:03.818
How you been, Joe?

20:04.157 --> 20:05.988
- Miss me?
- Get out.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.554
Well, it's nice to see you too.

20:10.063 --> 20:12.224
Dex said you might be in a mood.

20:12.432 --> 20:13.797
Dex?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.365
Get in here!

20:16.036 --> 20:20.700
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

20:20.907 --> 20:22.738
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

20:22.943 --> 20:24.535
You sabotaged my plane.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.542
Right.

20:28.748 --> 20:32.184
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

20:32.752 --> 20:35.118
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

20:35.589 --> 20:38.990
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

20:39.192 --> 20:42.355
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

20:42.562 --> 20:44.120
in his bathrobe, remember?

20:44.331 --> 20:45.696
You know, I'm starting to think

20:45.899 --> 20:47.867
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

20:48.068 --> 20:50.195
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

20:50.403 --> 20:52.963
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

20:53.173 --> 20:55.368
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

20:55.575 --> 20:57.566
Who was she, Joe?

20:57.844 --> 21:00.335
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

21:00.547 --> 21:02.037
What are you gonna do?

21:03.617 --> 21:04.914
Shoot me?

21:07.087 --> 21:09.487
Oh, great. We all made up.

21:09.956 --> 21:11.924
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

21:12.125 --> 21:16.152
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

21:16.363 --> 21:18.194
If she resists, shoot her.

21:18.398 --> 21:19.729
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.026
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

21:22.235 --> 21:23.702
Okay.

21:23.903 --> 21:28.340
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

21:28.942 --> 21:31.911
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

21:32.112 --> 21:33.943
Lots more.

21:37.851 --> 21:42.254
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

21:42.455 --> 21:44.753
And you're gonna help me get it.

21:45.492 --> 21:47.790
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

21:49.696 --> 21:50.822
Show me what?

21:56.069 --> 21:58.469
Show me what?

22:10.350 --> 22:13.012
My God. What is this?

22:13.753 --> 22:15.948
Where do they come from?

22:16.289 --> 22:20.521
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

22:20.727 --> 22:23.389
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

22:24.230 --> 22:26.255
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

22:26.466 --> 22:28.832
and then they disappear
without a trace.

22:29.202 --> 22:31.193
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

22:31.404 --> 22:32.837
or who's sending them here.

22:33.039 --> 22:35.667
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

22:35.875 --> 22:39.072
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

22:39.279 --> 22:42.544
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

22:42.749 --> 22:44.239
Totenkopf.

22:44.451 --> 22:46.316
He nearly went white
when he said it.

22:46.519 --> 22:48.783
Totenkopf, who is he?

22:48.988 --> 22:51.354
He's the invisible man.

22:51.558 --> 22:55.119
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

22:55.328 --> 22:58.593
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

22:58.798 --> 23:00.493
This is the only thing I could dig up.

23:02.602 --> 23:05.867
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

23:06.072 --> 23:07.835
before the start of World War I.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.202
Something called Unit 11.

23:10.410 --> 23:13.538
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

23:13.947 --> 23:15.812
Until today.

23:16.049 --> 23:18.984
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

23:19.252 --> 23:22.449
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

23:24.591 --> 23:27.719
The scientist, where is he now?

23:28.828 --> 23:31.524
We're in this together, right, Joe?

23:34.801 --> 23:37.861
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

23:38.071 --> 23:40.699
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

23:41.441 --> 23:43.238
Understood.

23:57.524 --> 23:59.048
What?

23:59.659 --> 24:01.650
I missed you.

24:04.063 --> 24:07.089
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

24:09.002 --> 24:10.833
Were you down there?

24:11.171 --> 24:14.800
You missed me too. How nice.

24:18.077 --> 24:21.342
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

24:29.422 --> 24:33.051
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

24:35.528 --> 24:36.825
Dr. Jennings!

24:37.030 --> 24:38.759
It's locked.

24:39.265 --> 24:40.596
That window there.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.874
I may be able to get in
through that window

24:50.076 --> 24:52.067
if I can attach a line...

24:56.716 --> 24:57.774
It's open.

25:12.165 --> 25:14.463
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

25:59.546 --> 26:01.446
All right, Polly...

26:02.115 --> 26:04.379
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

26:04.584 --> 26:07.212
I was hoping you could tell me.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.823
Dr. Jennings!

26:14.027 --> 26:15.961
You must stop him!

26:19.265 --> 26:20.960
Stay here.

26:29.509 --> 26:30.703
Stop!

26:34.113 --> 26:35.307
I don't wanna hurt you.

27:08.848 --> 27:10.975
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

27:11.184 --> 27:14.642
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

27:14.988 --> 27:18.583
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

27:18.791 --> 27:22.352
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

27:22.562 --> 27:23.551
Promise.

27:39.912 --> 27:40.970
He's dead.

27:41.981 --> 27:44.176
I think I found something.

27:47.687 --> 27:50.952
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

27:56.462 --> 27:59.454
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

27:59.666 --> 28:01.099
Of course you are.

28:17.717 --> 28:20.379
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

28:20.586 --> 28:21.780
and coming straight for us.

28:21.988 --> 28:24.980
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

28:31.998 --> 28:34.023
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

29:05.765 --> 29:07.357
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

29:07.567 --> 29:10.297
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

29:10.503 --> 29:12.403
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

29:12.605 --> 29:14.835
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

29:15.041 --> 29:17.373
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

29:17.577 --> 29:18.544
Go, go, go!

29:22.815 --> 29:24.282
Get in.

29:45.104 --> 29:46.662
There you are.

29:49.175 --> 29:52.576
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.009
Come in, Dex.

30:02.555 --> 30:05.490
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

30:08.461 --> 30:10.361
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

30:10.930 --> 30:12.329
<i>- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,</i>

30:12.532 --> 30:13.829
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

30:14.033 --> 30:15.193
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

30:17.370 --> 30:18.894
Which machine is it, Dex?

30:20.339 --> 30:23.069
<i>There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.</i>

30:27.046 --> 30:28.104
I think I found it, Dex.

30:36.622 --> 30:39.785
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

30:39.992 --> 30:42.483
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

30:42.695 --> 30:44.128
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

30:44.564 --> 30:46.532
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

30:46.732 --> 30:48.029
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

30:56.676 --> 30:59.076
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

30:59.278 --> 31:01.712
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

31:15.862 --> 31:17.420
They've come back
for the generators.

31:18.531 --> 31:19.589
Who is this guy?

31:27.340 --> 31:28.637
- You okay?
- Great.

31:28.841 --> 31:31.435
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

31:31.644 --> 31:33.942
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

31:34.146 --> 31:35.238
Pull up!

31:49.929 --> 31:51.089
- Joe!
- I see it!

31:57.236 --> 31:58.203
It's getting away.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.466
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

32:07.380 --> 32:10.110
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

32:10.316 --> 32:14.616
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

32:14.921 --> 32:18.254
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

32:24.163 --> 32:25.255
Hey!

32:32.271 --> 32:33.863
Okay, okay, now go straight.

32:34.073 --> 32:36.132
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

32:37.643 --> 32:39.474
Back there.

32:46.986 --> 32:49.420
I could use a little more warning
next time.

32:49.622 --> 32:50.589
Go left!

32:57.296 --> 32:58.763
Tell me you got something, Dex.

33:00.066 --> 33:01.795
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

33:02.001 --> 33:05.493
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

33:09.742 --> 33:11.039
Joe!

33:23.489 --> 33:25.684
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

33:25.891 --> 33:27.586
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

33:27.793 --> 33:29.852
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

33:34.433 --> 33:36.560
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

33:38.337 --> 33:40.828
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.235
Will you just trust me? Go left!

33:49.181 --> 33:51.149
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

33:51.350 --> 33:52.317
It's a dead end!

33:55.921 --> 33:56.910
There's no way out!

33:58.657 --> 33:59.624
Oh, bugger.

34:09.268 --> 34:10.393
Joe!

34:31.023 --> 34:34.014
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

34:34.659 --> 34:35.888
I got us here, didn't I?

34:39.998 --> 34:43.264
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

34:43.469 --> 34:46.233
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

34:46.438 --> 34:50.398
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

34:53.978 --> 34:55.378
Still glad you came?

35:09.295 --> 35:10.762
Joe, I found it! Joe!

35:13.032 --> 35:14.260
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

35:20.039 --> 35:22.803
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

35:26.078 --> 35:27.477
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

35:31.884 --> 35:33.351
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

36:13.993 --> 36:15.620
I can't outrun them much longer.

36:16.762 --> 36:17.888
Hold on.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.366
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

36:23.569 --> 36:26.003
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

36:26.205 --> 36:29.072
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

36:31.544 --> 36:32.841
Joe, you have to pull up!

36:41.253 --> 36:43.016
Pull up!

36:59.738 --> 37:02.866
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

37:03.075 --> 37:04.838
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

37:15.454 --> 37:16.978
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

37:17.189 --> 37:19.851
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

37:20.059 --> 37:22.789
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

37:24.063 --> 37:27.362
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

37:27.566 --> 37:30.399
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

37:31.203 --> 37:33.068
Oh, I can take it.

37:33.973 --> 37:37.170
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

37:37.376 --> 37:38.604
Because that was nothing.

37:56.262 --> 37:58.730
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

38:00.633 --> 38:02.931
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

38:23.622 --> 38:25.214
Dex!

38:27.593 --> 38:28.821
Dex!

38:32.564 --> 38:34.156
Dex.

38:54.653 --> 38:56.484
They're everywhere.

38:58.991 --> 39:00.356
Joe, look out!

39:50.342 --> 39:51.832
Dex!

40:00.152 --> 40:02.586
Why would Totenkopf do this?

40:04.623 --> 40:07.114
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

40:13.999 --> 40:16.490
He was looking for something.

40:21.373 --> 40:24.433
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

40:25.577 --> 40:27.408
He must have got too close.

40:48.167 --> 40:49.930
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.

41:03.382 --> 41:04.542
Good boy, Dex.

41:53.765 --> 41:56.563
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

41:56.768 --> 42:00.636
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

42:01.573 --> 42:03.370
- My God.
- What?

42:03.575 --> 42:07.011
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

42:07.846 --> 42:10.679
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

42:10.883 --> 42:14.148
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

42:14.353 --> 42:18.312
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

42:18.524 --> 42:20.583
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

42:20.792 --> 42:24.091
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

42:24.296 --> 42:26.594
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

42:26.798 --> 42:30.427
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

42:30.636 --> 42:33.127
Even less is known
about his companion,

42:33.338 --> 42:35.568
an assassin who controls
his machines."

42:35.774 --> 42:37.264
She's the one who took Dex.

42:38.944 --> 42:39.911
What else?

42:44.883 --> 42:47.181
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

42:47.386 --> 42:49.320
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

42:49.521 --> 42:52.957
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

42:53.158 --> 42:56.184
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

42:57.963 --> 43:00.523
What have you been up to, doctor?

43:13.211 --> 43:15.873
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

43:18.350 --> 43:19.817
We'll find him.

44:00.592 --> 44:02.253
My old friend Joe.

44:02.461 --> 44:03.161
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

44:03.161 --> 44:05.493
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

44:05.697 --> 44:09.326
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

44:09.568 --> 44:11.195
Nice to meet you.

44:14.673 --> 44:18.609
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

44:18.810 --> 44:20.744
Did you get a little something
for me?

44:20.946 --> 44:25.144
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

44:25.350 --> 44:30.117
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

44:30.322 --> 44:32.449
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

44:41.166 --> 44:42.360
Come, I'll show you the maps.

44:46.738 --> 44:48.638
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

44:48.840 --> 44:52.640
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

44:53.178 --> 44:54.475
I don't trust him.

44:54.680 --> 44:57.410
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

44:58.717 --> 45:02.744
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

45:02.954 --> 45:05.787
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

45:13.532 --> 45:18.868
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

45:19.171 --> 45:21.571
This is where
the transmission originated.

45:21.773 --> 45:24.207
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

45:26.111 --> 45:28.341
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

45:28.880 --> 45:30.177
It is forbidden.

45:30.382 --> 45:34.079
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

45:34.286 --> 45:36.846
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

45:37.055 --> 45:39.819
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

45:40.058 --> 45:42.219
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

45:42.961 --> 45:47.022
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

45:47.232 --> 45:49.894
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

45:50.102 --> 45:52.536
Why? Why is this place so special?

45:52.738 --> 45:56.504
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

45:56.708 --> 45:59.541
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

45:59.745 --> 46:02.942
You may know it as Shangri-la.

46:08.220 --> 46:12.748
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

46:13.358 --> 46:15.622
I need to send a message.

46:20.599 --> 46:24.729
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.</i>

46:24.936 --> 46:28.838
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

46:29.040 --> 46:31.804
<i>The story grows stranger
at every turn.</i>

46:32.010 --> 46:35.275
<i>Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.</i>

46:35.480 --> 46:36.913
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

46:37.415 --> 46:40.680
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.</i>

46:40.886 --> 46:44.253
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

47:11.082 --> 47:14.245
This is where civilization stops.

47:14.452 --> 47:16.352
A blank on the map.

47:17.789 --> 47:20.155
We must be careful from here.

47:23.195 --> 47:24.492
Hurry.

47:50.021 --> 47:51.420
What is it?

47:51.623 --> 47:54.023
It looks like a mining outpost.

47:54.226 --> 47:56.820
Something bad happened here.

48:00.899 --> 48:02.867
Seems to be abandoned.

48:03.068 --> 48:05.229
Tell your men we're heading down.

48:06.738 --> 48:08.262
I want a closer look.

48:51.850 --> 48:53.181
What is it, Joe?

48:53.385 --> 48:54.579
Uranium.

48:54.786 --> 48:57.482
The whole mine's contaminated.

48:58.023 --> 48:59.456
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

49:01.026 --> 49:01.993
Where's Polly?

49:06.731 --> 49:08.426
Polly!

49:08.633 --> 49:10.692
Miss Perkins?

49:17.208 --> 49:18.334
We'll have to split up.

49:26.351 --> 49:27.818
Polly!

49:30.055 --> 49:31.886
Let her go.

49:34.926 --> 49:36.917
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

49:37.128 --> 49:38.686
What vials?
What are you talking about?

49:40.632 --> 49:42.463
I will not ask a second time.

49:43.234 --> 49:44.929
Drop the gun.

49:53.311 --> 49:55.836
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

49:56.047 --> 49:58.345
As you wish.

49:59.451 --> 50:01.351
Wait! Wait. Wait.

50:11.129 --> 50:12.460
I'm sorry, Joe.

50:12.664 --> 50:15.792
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

50:27.112 --> 50:29.979
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

50:31.116 --> 50:33.744
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

50:33.952 --> 50:38.252
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

50:38.456 --> 50:40.856
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

50:41.059 --> 50:43.789
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

50:43.995 --> 50:45.826
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

50:48.233 --> 50:50.394
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

50:50.602 --> 50:55.596
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

50:56.441 --> 50:59.376
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

50:59.577 --> 51:02.068
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

51:03.048 --> 51:04.709
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.483
Do you hear that?

51:23.168 --> 51:25.159
Dynamite.

51:27.539 --> 51:28.699
That noise again.

51:38.349 --> 51:39.873
Move!

51:54.466 --> 51:55.660
What are you doing?

51:59.104 --> 52:00.469
Come on!

52:02.474 --> 52:03.736
Oh, great.

52:03.942 --> 52:05.637
We're safe.

52:06.010 --> 52:08.945
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

52:09.147 --> 52:11.081
There's something
I need to ask you.

52:11.282 --> 52:12.476
Yes, Joe?

52:15.386 --> 52:17.445
Did you cut my fuel line?

52:17.655 --> 52:22.024
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

52:22.227 --> 52:25.287
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

52:25.497 --> 52:27.658
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

52:41.045 --> 52:42.672
There you are.

52:42.881 --> 52:45.349
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

52:46.751 --> 52:47.718
My film.

52:48.520 --> 52:51.182
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

53:07.639 --> 53:09.402
Polly.

53:11.910 --> 53:13.036
Polly.

53:40.935 --> 53:42.698
My clothes.

53:44.639 --> 53:47.608
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

53:47.809 --> 53:50.676
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

53:50.879 --> 53:54.815
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.

53:56.284 --> 53:59.481
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

54:00.622 --> 54:04.615
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

54:07.295 --> 54:09.695
Stop looking at me like that.

54:10.732 --> 54:12.393
Like what?

54:14.269 --> 54:16.362
Turn around, Joe.

54:16.938 --> 54:19.429
I'm serious. Turn around.

54:25.814 --> 54:26.838
Hi, Joe.

54:48.036 --> 54:49.936
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

54:52.974 --> 54:54.441
The clothes are burned.

54:54.642 --> 54:56.507
Burned? Why?

54:59.814 --> 55:01.839
He says the mine is poisonous.

55:02.050 --> 55:03.108
Our clothes were infected.

55:06.821 --> 55:09.915
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

55:10.125 --> 55:12.616
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

55:12.827 --> 55:16.092
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

55:23.338 --> 55:24.896
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

55:25.306 --> 55:26.671
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

55:27.008 --> 55:29.943
It's very important we find this man.

55:30.612 --> 55:31.977
His name is Totenkopf!

55:37.051 --> 55:39.019
He says, what do you want
with this man?

55:39.220 --> 55:41.085
I've come to kill him.

55:41.322 --> 55:42.983
And to find my friend.

55:48.029 --> 55:49.792
He says he will help you.

55:59.674 --> 56:01.505
What do you think?

56:05.680 --> 56:07.739
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

56:09.050 --> 56:11.382
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

56:11.586 --> 56:13.417
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

56:14.589 --> 56:15.851
They're waiting for us.

56:17.926 --> 56:20.861
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

56:21.062 --> 56:23.121
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

56:23.331 --> 56:26.232
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

56:26.434 --> 56:28.459
Where is Totenkopf now?

56:28.670 --> 56:32.606
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

56:37.378 --> 56:39.573
I can't believe this is happening.

56:41.616 --> 56:44.244
I only have two shots left.

56:44.552 --> 56:48.318
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

56:48.523 --> 56:49.888
Everything I had was in that bag.

56:50.091 --> 56:51.649
You should have let me go back
for my film.

56:51.860 --> 56:54.090
You're right, I should have.

56:59.868 --> 57:01.358
So where's he taking us?

57:01.569 --> 57:06.029
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

57:06.241 --> 57:07.970
What experiments?

57:20.488 --> 57:24.686
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

57:32.267 --> 57:34.235
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

57:34.435 --> 57:37.427
To make him pay
for what he has done.

57:48.516 --> 57:51.383
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

57:52.787 --> 57:56.689
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

57:58.393 --> 58:01.624
Rana? Is there such a place?

58:06.100 --> 58:09.536
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

58:10.805 --> 58:12.534
Of course. Anything.

58:17.345 --> 58:18.710
What do you want?

58:23.017 --> 58:25.281
Kill me.

58:35.730 --> 58:38.824
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

58:41.002 --> 58:42.993
And there's a moon and a star.

58:46.941 --> 58:51.344
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

58:52.113 --> 58:55.605
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

58:57.085 --> 58:58.552
A star.

58:58.753 --> 59:01.847
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

59:02.056 --> 59:04.183
Rana is a star.

59:04.525 --> 59:08.586
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

59:08.796 --> 59:12.459
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

59:12.967 --> 59:14.068
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

59:14.068 --> 59:16.832
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

59:17.038 --> 59:19.871
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

59:20.074 --> 59:24.511
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

59:24.712 --> 59:26.202
You mean this could really work?

59:26.414 --> 59:29.212
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

59:29.417 --> 59:31.408
We do things a little
different nowadays.

59:31.619 --> 59:34.611
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

59:34.822 --> 59:36.517
- March 2.
- March 2.

59:36.724 --> 59:40.820
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

59:41.763 --> 59:43.697
March 2...

59:45.533 --> 59:50.197
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

59:51.105 --> 59:57.840
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

59:58.279 --> 01:00:03.046
Declination, minus 10.60.

01:00:08.356 --> 01:00:10.415
There's nothing there.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.820
Are you sure you did it right?

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.756
I'm sure.

01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:18.330
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:20.660
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

01:00:30.978 --> 01:00:32.809
What's that point there?

01:00:33.014 --> 01:00:34.879
That's where we run out of fuel.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.744
Oh, great.

01:00:38.853 --> 01:00:40.184
So how do we get there?

01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:46.626
- Franky.
- Who?

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:50.129
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

01:00:50.331 --> 01:00:52.629
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

01:00:53.935 --> 01:00:56.096
If I can get a message to them,

01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:59.102
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

01:01:00.274 --> 01:01:01.707
And what if they don't
get the message?

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:05.037
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

01:01:07.381 --> 01:01:08.439
They'll be there.

01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:26.826
Is that light supposed to be on?

01:01:27.034 --> 01:01:28.558
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

01:01:30.037 --> 01:01:33.200
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:38.402
Manta Station, do you read me?

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:41.378
Where are you, Franky?

01:01:46.687 --> 01:01:47.847
What are you doing?

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:51.120
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

01:01:51.392 --> 01:01:53.986
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:58.230
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

01:01:58.432 --> 01:02:00.161
Dex had a hand in designing it.

01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:03.629
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

01:02:03.838 --> 01:02:04.896
Yeah.

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:07.631
I can keep a secret.

01:02:14.215 --> 01:02:15.682
Two shots.

01:02:15.883 --> 01:02:20.252
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.</i>

01:02:20.822 --> 01:02:22.449
Copy, 327.

01:02:22.657 --> 01:02:24.887
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:08.297
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

01:03:11.072 --> 01:03:12.835
It's good to see you too, Franky.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.306
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

01:03:17.511 --> 01:03:18.637
It's important.

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:23.811
What is that?

01:03:29.423 --> 01:03:31.186
You be nice.

01:03:32.426 --> 01:03:35.156
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:38.861
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:41.159
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

01:03:42.103 --> 01:03:45.504
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:52.209
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:54.347
or at least you were last time...

01:03:54.548 --> 01:03:56.948
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:59.142
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

01:03:59.353 --> 01:04:02.811
<i>- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.</i>

01:04:03.024 --> 01:04:04.389
<i>- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.</i>

01:04:14.735 --> 01:04:16.566
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:17.738
Yes, commander.

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:20.403
Reconnaissance located an island

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:23.372
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

01:04:23.577 --> 01:04:26.045
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

01:04:26.247 --> 01:04:28.215
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

01:04:30.117 --> 01:04:32.608
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.754
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:39.555
Polly, try not to touch anything.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.890
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

01:04:44.098 --> 01:04:47.329
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

01:04:58.346 --> 01:05:00.837
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

01:05:08.389 --> 01:05:09.879
Totenkopf.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.852
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

01:05:16.063 --> 01:05:19.226
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.800
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

01:05:22.003 --> 01:05:25.097
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

01:05:25.306 --> 01:05:27.331
He's got Dex.

01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:31.301
Rescind order!

01:05:33.314 --> 01:05:36.806
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:43.956
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

01:05:44.158 --> 01:05:47.389
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:49.292
But...

01:05:50.464 --> 01:05:51.988
...this area here,

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:53.962
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

01:05:54.168 --> 01:05:58.605
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

01:05:58.873 --> 01:06:01.068
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:03.641
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

01:06:03.844 --> 01:06:05.277
Leave that to me.

01:06:07.681 --> 01:06:09.478
Alert the amphibious squadron.

01:06:13.521 --> 01:06:16.388
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

01:06:54.128 --> 01:06:55.390
What?

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:56.790
Nanjing?

01:06:57.965 --> 01:07:00.263
I can't hear you, Polly.

01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:01.998
You'll have to speak up.

01:07:23.224 --> 01:07:26.785
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

01:07:26.994 --> 01:07:29.724
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:35.602
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

01:07:36.036 --> 01:07:37.196
Thank you, Polly.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.336
So you heard that, did you?

01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:46.708
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.</i>

01:07:46.914 --> 01:07:48.609
Switching to amphibious mode.

01:07:57.992 --> 01:08:00.961
Impact in five, four, three,

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:03.289
two, one.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:30.682
Franky.

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.951
<i>You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:36.629
<i>We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.129
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

01:08:40.334 --> 01:08:41.733
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!</i>

01:08:41.935 --> 01:08:44.461
<i>- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"</i>

01:08:55.115 --> 01:09:00.075
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.734
Joe, watch out!

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:59.675
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

01:10:03.217 --> 01:10:06.414
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.685
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

01:10:15.029 --> 01:10:16.724
Manta leader to Manta team,

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:20.195
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

01:10:22.836 --> 01:10:23.803
Fire.

01:10:38.018 --> 01:10:40.213
Joseph! Pull up!

01:10:52.466 --> 01:10:54.957
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

01:10:57.404 --> 01:10:59.304
Do you hear me? Disengage.

01:11:00.307 --> 01:11:01.535
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:11:01.742 --> 01:11:04.540
<i>- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

01:11:04.745 --> 01:11:07.475
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

01:11:10.651 --> 01:11:11.879
Disengage!

01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:31.433
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

01:11:31.638 --> 01:11:33.003
<i>You're only going to have
one shot at this.</i>

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:35.266
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

01:11:35.476 --> 01:11:37.410
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

01:11:37.878 --> 01:11:39.436
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:41.511
Franky, pull up.

01:11:43.183 --> 01:11:44.980
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

01:11:45.185 --> 01:11:46.675
Two.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.182
One.

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.169
You're all clear.

01:12:04.772 --> 01:12:06.637
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:09.636
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

01:12:10.844 --> 01:12:12.175
She's some kind of girl.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:14.506
Yes, I know.

01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:38.037
I'm taking us up.

01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:33.590
What?

01:13:38.866 --> 01:13:43.064
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

01:13:58.218 --> 01:14:02.245
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

01:14:02.456 --> 01:14:04.617
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

01:14:04.825 --> 01:14:06.816
Suit yourself.

01:14:09.363 --> 01:14:12.696
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

01:14:35.789 --> 01:14:37.086
Run.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:49.866
There.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.019
Polly!

01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:16.222
Oh, great.

01:15:17.864 --> 01:15:19.354
Come on!

01:15:21.535 --> 01:15:22.502
Polly!

01:15:24.504 --> 01:15:25.994
Come on!

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:36.850
Are you mad?

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:37.680
Are you mad?

01:15:37.884 --> 01:15:42.048
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

01:15:47.027 --> 01:15:49.427
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:51.928
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!

01:15:54.468 --> 01:15:55.992
- What?
- When we were running,

01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:59.104
I shot the ground.

01:16:03.677 --> 01:16:05.577
It isn't funny.

01:16:07.614 --> 01:16:12.711
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

01:16:19.593 --> 01:16:22.460
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

01:16:23.063 --> 01:16:24.553
You gave it to me.

01:16:27.634 --> 01:16:29.261
You don't even remember, do you?

01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:33.162
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

01:16:33.373 --> 01:16:35.933
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

01:16:36.476 --> 01:16:38.273
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

01:16:38.478 --> 01:16:39.877
and I want you to tell me the truth.

01:16:40.113 --> 01:16:43.947
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:46.245
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

01:16:46.453 --> 01:16:49.479
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:52.249
Look me in the eyes.

01:16:53.827 --> 01:16:56.261
I never fooled around on you.

01:16:56.463 --> 01:16:57.430
Never.

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:02.267
I sabotaged your plane.

01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:05.795
- Three months.
- I knew it!

01:17:06.006 --> 01:17:08.839
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy...

01:17:13.513 --> 01:17:15.208
He's here.

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:27.754
You all right?

01:17:43.643 --> 01:17:45.008
Through there.

01:17:51.752 --> 01:17:52.719
Through there.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.679
My God, Joe.

01:18:56.016 --> 01:18:57.677
It's an ark.

01:18:57.884 --> 01:19:00.216
He's building an ark.

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:12.025
What are you doing?

01:19:14.034 --> 01:19:16.696
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

01:19:16.903 --> 01:19:20.031
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.572
inside a giant rocket ship?

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:24.803
I might.

01:19:26.313 --> 01:19:28.838
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

01:19:37.891 --> 01:19:40.621
<i>- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.</i>

01:19:40.827 --> 01:19:43.227
We have to find Totenkopf.

01:19:52.939 --> 01:19:54.600
You've got a gift.

01:20:20.133 --> 01:20:21.760
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

01:20:26.673 --> 01:20:27.833
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

01:20:35.382 --> 01:20:36.940
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:39.209
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:42.047
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

01:20:44.891 --> 01:20:46.188
The machines that were guarding us

01:20:46.393 --> 01:20:48.361
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

01:20:48.561 --> 01:20:50.859
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.900
Dex! Get us out of here!

01:21:19.225 --> 01:21:20.590
Good boy, Dex.

01:21:21.494 --> 01:21:22.756
Thanks, Cap.

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.097
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:30.394
Or what's left of them.

01:21:30.603 --> 01:21:33.629
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.102
Finish what?

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:36.442
Tell them.

01:21:36.643 --> 01:21:39.703
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

01:21:39.913 --> 01:21:41.540
so he proposed the unthinkable:

01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:45.184
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

01:21:45.385 --> 01:21:46.352
into space.

01:21:46.553 --> 01:21:48.544
He used his machines
to collect specimens

01:21:48.755 --> 01:21:50.416
representing all life on Earth.

01:21:50.623 --> 01:21:52.215
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

01:21:52.425 --> 01:21:55.223
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

01:21:55.428 --> 01:21:57.726
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

01:21:57.931 --> 01:22:00.195
Seeds of a technological utopia.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.799
We smuggled them off this island,

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:03.799
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

01:22:04.004 --> 01:22:07.565
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

01:22:07.774 --> 01:22:10.470
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

01:22:10.677 --> 01:22:13.305
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:15.413
Why? What haven't you told us?

01:22:15.615 --> 01:22:18.812
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

01:22:19.019 --> 01:22:21.783
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

01:22:21.988 --> 01:22:24.752
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

01:22:24.958 --> 01:22:27.051
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.820
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:31.290
Good boy, Dex.

01:22:35.435 --> 01:22:37.596
Careful. Careful.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.674
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:49.746
Through there.
That's the only way in.

01:22:49.949 --> 01:22:53.248
You see, there is no way past them.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.688
Five minutes, Joe.

01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:58.721
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

01:22:59.793 --> 01:23:01.351
He knows what he's doing.

01:23:03.997 --> 01:23:05.089
I think.

01:23:10.003 --> 01:23:10.970
Hey, that's my gun!

01:23:16.543 --> 01:23:17.737
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

01:23:25.785 --> 01:23:29.152
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

01:23:29.355 --> 01:23:30.652
Doctor, stop!

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:50.566
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:53.041
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

01:23:53.246 --> 01:23:56.477
<i>What has begun
cannot be stopped.</i>

01:23:56.683 --> 01:24:00.016
<i>- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.</i>

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.482
Hello, doctor.

01:24:01.688 --> 01:24:03.155
Why are you doing this?

01:24:03.356 --> 01:24:06.325
<i>I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred</i>

01:24:06.526 --> 01:24:08.824
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

01:24:09.028 --> 01:24:12.327
<i>Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise</i>

01:24:12.532 --> 01:24:15.831
<i>and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.</i>

01:24:16.035 --> 01:24:19.266
<i>I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself</i>

01:24:19.572 --> 01:24:21.506
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:25.940
<i>I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.</i>

01:24:26.146 --> 01:24:28.842
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

01:24:35.588 --> 01:24:37.920
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:50.935
I meant throw something.

01:25:13.126 --> 01:25:14.388
He's not here.

01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:16.328
We're too late.

01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.224
These are his personal papers.

01:25:18.431 --> 01:25:21.923
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

01:25:22.135 --> 01:25:24.797
- We must find him.
- I found him.

01:25:39.852 --> 01:25:41.012
It's impossible.

01:25:42.255 --> 01:25:43.517
It can't be.

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:47.090
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:48.954
He died over 20 years ago.

01:25:55.835 --> 01:25:57.632
We've been chasing a ghost.

01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:12.784
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

01:26:18.858 --> 01:26:21.326
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

01:26:21.527 --> 01:26:26.897
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.069
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:33.262
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

01:26:35.341 --> 01:26:37.070
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

01:26:37.277 --> 01:26:39.643
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

01:26:39.846 --> 01:26:42.178
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

01:26:45.151 --> 01:26:47.711
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.218
it should create a short...

01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:55.019
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

01:26:55.228 --> 01:26:56.991
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

01:26:58.531 --> 01:27:01.898
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

01:27:02.101 --> 01:27:04.433
You won't have time to escape.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.001
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

01:27:10.209 --> 01:27:12.973
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

01:27:13.179 --> 01:27:15.704
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

01:27:15.915 --> 01:27:17.906
We had a deal.

01:27:18.584 --> 01:27:21.610
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:28.321
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

01:27:28.528 --> 01:27:31.691
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.108
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:53.083
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

01:28:07.467 --> 01:28:09.560
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

01:28:12.872 --> 01:28:13.896
How do you wanna do this?

01:29:21.741 --> 01:29:23.971
Nice shot, Polly.

01:29:34.353 --> 01:29:36.514
What took you so long?

01:29:40.893 --> 01:29:42.053
She's a machine.

01:29:49.268 --> 01:29:51.896
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:53.702
<i>Nine...</i>

01:29:53.906 --> 01:29:55.203
<i>... eight...</i>

01:29:55.408 --> 01:29:56.932
<i>... seven...</i>

01:29:57.143 --> 01:29:58.405
<i>... six...</i>

01:29:58.611 --> 01:29:59.942
<i>... five...</i>

01:30:00.146 --> 01:30:01.704
<i>... four...</i>

01:30:50.997 --> 01:30:52.760
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

01:30:52.965 --> 01:30:55.160
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:56.630
There's no time.

01:31:01.073 --> 01:31:02.597
That's our only way across.

01:31:07.413 --> 01:31:09.881
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:31:19.058 --> 01:31:22.619
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!</i>

01:31:23.095 --> 01:31:24.790
What did you do now?

01:31:29.068 --> 01:31:30.035
Come on!

01:31:30.236 --> 01:31:32.864
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:31:45.785 --> 01:31:47.685
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:31:50.923 --> 01:31:52.515
Hold on!

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:02.996
Please! Don't touch anything else!

01:32:11.177 --> 01:32:13.668
There's no time. We'll never make it.

01:32:14.814 --> 01:32:17.578
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:32:25.324 --> 01:32:26.348
Run!

01:32:27.827 --> 01:32:30.227
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:40.268
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

01:32:42.808 --> 01:32:45.675
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:32:49.815 --> 01:32:52.010
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

01:33:01.293 --> 01:33:02.260
It didn't work.

01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.799
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:33:08.401 --> 01:33:11.666
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

01:33:13.205 --> 01:33:17.141
<i>And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...</i>

01:33:17.343 --> 01:33:20.278
<i>- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

01:33:20.479 --> 01:33:21.776
Shut up!

01:33:21.981 --> 01:33:24.575
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

01:33:25.084 --> 01:33:26.051
<i>Nine...</i>

01:33:27.053 --> 01:33:28.418
<i>... eight...</i>

01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:29.713
<i>... seven...</i>

01:33:30.222 --> 01:33:32.782
<i>- ... six...
- Why won't you die?</i>
