03:02.724 --> 03:04.516
Tom, glad to see you made it.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.602
I wouldn't miss it.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.563
National Weather Institute,
this is NASA Command.

03:09.731 --> 03:13.025
Transferring control
of satellite Gulf-001...

03:13.192 --> 03:14.276
...in six...

03:14.444 --> 03:16.528
...five, four...

03:16.696 --> 03:18.280
Do source code.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.537
Enter current access code.
Captains Trilling, Gilder...

03:40.678 --> 03:42.763
We got it. It's ours.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.057
Be advised...

03:45.224 --> 03:48.769
...we have received satellite Gulf-001.
Thank you, Houston.

03:49.228 --> 03:51.980
All right, let's see what she can do.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.068
Activating observation function.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.154
Setting for Stage 2.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.538
What have we got here?

04:08.706 --> 04:10.624
Clean it up.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.129
Oh, my God, she's turning over!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.716
Apply full image enhancing.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.683
Holy guacamole!

04:29.602 --> 04:31.687
The damn thing works.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.148
That goddamn Travis Dane.

04:35.316 --> 04:39.403
If the optical circuits are this good,
the targeting system must be great.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.363
Dane would love this.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.658
NASA thinks this is
a weather satellite.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.828
Let's do a weapons check.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.832
This wasn't the bust
Congress thought it was.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.835
What Congress don't know
won't hurt them, or us.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.837
Something wrong, captain?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.339
It's too bad Dane wasn't here today.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.717
Travis Dane was a nut.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.136
He drove his car into a lake.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.679
He was crazy.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.014
They found the body yet?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.974
No, just the car.

05:09.183 --> 05:13.311
And a note that said,
"Chance favors the prepared mind."

05:13.479 --> 05:14.688
Odd, huh?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.691
But then, so was Dane.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.694
Captains, you did a hell of a job.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.779
Be proud of yourselves.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.322
Enjoy your weekend.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.824
Thank you, general.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.035
Can I talk to you? Excuse me.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.911
Have a nice weekend.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.039
Go home.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.209
There's an air show at
the Air Force Academy this weekend.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.129
Maybe you'd like to join me for a drink?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.382
Check out the new technologies.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.136
All the top brass will be there.
Who knows...

05:46.596 --> 05:48.472
...it might help your career.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.141
Sorry, I have plans.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.727
Yeah, sure, I understand.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.063
Like the general said...

05:56.481 --> 05:58.398
...you did a good job.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.901
Thank you...

06:01.486 --> 06:02.736
...sir.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.043
Let's go, you're running late.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.258
Where have you been?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.264
On a special op?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.433
Lieutenant, always a pleasure.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.727
I know, you can't tell me.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.939
Sorry to hear about your brother.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.816
Me too.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.946
You'll have to hurry to make that train.
It leaves in 45 minutes.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.824
Why are you two taking
a train to California?

06:48.991 --> 06:51.535
Would you fly if your parents died
in a plane crash?

06:51.702 --> 06:52.744
Hi, Casey.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.333
This place runs better when you're here.
I can run it, but...

06:58.501 --> 07:00.127
You can't cook.

07:00.294 --> 07:03.755
The patrons come here for you, Casey,
not for me.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.803
Cute kid.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.473
- Is that your niece?
- Yes. She's the only family I have.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.393
I don't know if I'll recognize her.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.064
Come on, we'll miss that train.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.067
I missed my brother's funeral, so...

07:24.277 --> 07:26.069
...we won't miss the train.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.822
Your attention, please.

07:28.990 --> 07:34.828
The Grand Continental, with service from
Denver to Los Angeles, now boarding.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.328
Has a Sarah Ryback
picked up any tickets?

08:16.662 --> 08:18.330
Uncle Casey.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.875
Nice to see you too.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.127
You've gotten big.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.254
A lot can happen in five years.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.424
Just a moment.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.260
So, what have you been doing?

08:34.513 --> 08:38.225
Taking care of airplane crashes,
funerals, stuff like that.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.559
Yeah, so...

08:40.727 --> 08:42.520
Here you are. Track 3.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.286
You know, I was thinking...

08:58.454 --> 09:01.957
I remembered that you collect
teddy bears and I got you one.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.752
It isn't as good as some of yours...

09:05.920 --> 09:08.213
...and I know you may be too mature...

09:08.422 --> 09:10.882
...to hang out with teddy bears now.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.635
But it's the thought that counts.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.970
Thanks.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.226
I guess I'm not trained for this.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.147
Excuse me.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.902
Can I carry your bags? Oh, nice...

09:31.779 --> 09:33.613
...medal you got there.

09:33.781 --> 09:34.864
It's a Navy Cross.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.742
My uncle was in the Navy,
but he's not like you.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.786
- What is that?
- This?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.413
It's Mace.

09:41.580 --> 09:45.875
All right. Listen, I have to look busy,
so why don't you let me take your bag?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.836
If I don't, I could get fired.

09:48.004 --> 09:52.090
If I get fired, I won't have enough money
for college, and I'll be poor.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.385
This will work. I like this.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.804
What compartment did you say
you were in?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.931
My compartment.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.070
Sorry.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.908
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.670
Captain Gilder...

11:12.838 --> 11:14.172
...fancy meeting you here.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.717
Have some champagne, Captain Trilling.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.934
Good things to those who wait.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.356
Okay, you waited.

12:30.958 --> 12:35.044
Colorado Air Base, this is
Chopper Whiskey Bravo requesting...

12:57.818 --> 12:59.402
Hold it!

13:38.734 --> 13:42.862
I was wondering
what that girl over there's drinking.

13:43.864 --> 13:47.033
The girl with the tonic and lime
and the bad ID?

13:47.201 --> 13:48.368
That's the one.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.584
- You're not drinking?
- No.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.712
Join me. I don't like drinking alone.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.048
There's no alcohol in that.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.929
Yeah, you always knew everything,
anyway.

14:08.389 --> 14:12.016
Do you think we could have
a pleasant conversation?

14:12.476 --> 14:13.726
Sure.

14:14.895 --> 14:18.022
Let's talk about why you
and my dad stopped talking.

14:20.442 --> 14:26.030
Listen, I know that your father and I
had our differences.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.784
But that doesn't mean
I didn't love him.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.327
But you didn't even talk.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.249
Time goes by...

14:37.585 --> 14:40.295
...it seems to fly,
and before you know it...

14:41.005 --> 14:42.505
...things happen.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.260
But I never thought...

14:48.429 --> 14:51.556
...I'd never get a chance
to straighten things out with him.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.017
You know...

14:54.184 --> 14:58.730
...he didn't get the medals in the service
by being a choirboy.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.943
I don't want you talking
about my father that way.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.949
Think I need a drink.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.040
What's the strongest stuff you got?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.293
How about Puerto Rican rum?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.799
Uncle Casey...

15:28.260 --> 15:30.553
I don't want to fight.

15:31.013 --> 15:35.475
I just promised myself that before
I got here, I would tell you how I felt.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.019
Now...

15:38.187 --> 15:40.063
...let's just be friends.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.900
Okay.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.277
I'm going for a walk.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.878
- What's up?
- What's in there?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.423
It's top-secret.
I can't let you get in there.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.591
What's in there?

16:08.759 --> 16:12.845
Don't make me restrain you,
because I've been working out, see?

16:13.514 --> 16:14.889
It'd be easy to do that.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.432
Okay. Restrain me.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.311
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.356
All right, if you say so.
It's gonna be real easy.

16:30.531 --> 16:35.451
There's a mop, a broom and a lot of
smelly stuff you want to avoid.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.039
Who taught you that?

16:40.207 --> 16:44.877
When I was 11 years old, my uncle
taught me all this really neat stuff.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.380
The dude that's with you?

16:48.465 --> 16:51.050
Yeah, I guess.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.808
I can do that.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.232
What are you writing?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.736
It's a book.
My memoirs, stuff like that.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.239
Aren't you too young
to be writing your memoirs?

17:17.035 --> 17:21.038
I know it's against the rules,
but give me a shot of something.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.583
Can you put those up there?

17:23.751 --> 17:24.834
Yeah.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.588
What's up with that niece of yours,
Miss Bruce Lee?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.548
She almost killed me.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.509
Going up!

17:33.677 --> 17:35.928
You taught her all that shit?

17:36.346 --> 17:37.930
I taught her a few things.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.516
She's lucky she's a girl.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.604
- I know a little of that stuff, myself.
- That's what I hear.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.023
From you, but that's what I hear.

17:47.816 --> 17:51.444
Don't give him the brandy.
I need it for the cake.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.535
Look at that.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.456
Because the train is rocking,
it's cramping my style.

18:03.624 --> 18:07.835
I'm making this for Sarah
because it's her favorite thing.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.599
Fifteen minutes, on high.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.810
The rest is up to God.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.896
Now, go find Sarah,
and we'll surprise her.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.947
- What was that?
- It's called a...

18:36.281 --> 18:37.406
...orgasm.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.868
Sounds like torpedoes.
We must be in dark territory.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.663
What the hell is this?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.623
They're not our guys.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.844
What's the trouble?

18:58.011 --> 18:59.428
What's going on?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.515
- Someone's been shot.
- Where?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.100
Here.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.609
Loco secured.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.028
Move! You have four minutes.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.510
Everybody to the back of the train!
Don't make me ask twice!

19:48.896 --> 19:52.565
Everybody up those stairs! Move it!
Come on!

19:53.734 --> 19:56.193
Shut that bitch up, or I will!
Move it!

19:56.904 --> 19:58.529
Get up the stairs! Let's go!

20:07.205 --> 20:11.250
What the fuck is this? Anything else?
Go! Get out of here!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.555
Open that door to the baggage car!

20:30.854 --> 20:32.355
Check the baggage.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.110
Baggage checked.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.575
Any other heroes?

20:57.297 --> 20:59.590
One casualty in the dining car.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.888
Fire in the hole!

21:06.056 --> 21:07.306
Take cover!

21:22.781 --> 21:24.490
Four cooks. Check.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.576
Copy that. Continue with the cleanup.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.345
We leave in 20 seconds.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.408
This, I'm trained for.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.413
Oh, my God.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.543
Well, here you are.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.506
The last place anyone would expect
to find you.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.257
Amazing.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.353
Put something on.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.823
Have a seat, captains.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.247
They said you were dead.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.832
Yeah, very restful.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.917
No phone calls.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.423
You two have been very naughty.

23:47.217 --> 23:51.178
ATAC has strict rules against employees
getting involved with each other.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.972
Is that what this is about?

23:53.390 --> 23:58.144
Yeah, right. I faked my own death
and hijacked a passenger train...

23:58.311 --> 24:00.896
...because I care about who you fuck.

24:01.064 --> 24:05.151
No, I wondered what other rules
you'd be willing to break.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.194
Online transmission's ready, sir.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.821
Don't go away.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.493
Good evening, everyone.
This is your captor speaking.

24:14.661 --> 24:18.414
There's been a slight change
in your travel plans tonight.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.334
You have, you will note, been moved
to the last two cars of the train...

24:22.502 --> 24:24.295
...for your own wellbeing.

24:24.462 --> 24:28.424
First, I'd like to call your attention
to the highly trained men...

24:28.592 --> 24:30.801
...with the automatic weapons.

24:30.969 --> 24:35.472
In the event of an emergency,
they may be called upon to shoot you.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.976
Your safety is our primary concern.

24:39.477 --> 24:42.354
However, if you try anything stupid...

24:42.522 --> 24:45.649
...federal regulations require that I kill you.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.859
He's insane.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.694
So please...

24:48.862 --> 24:50.487
...no hero shit.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.552
Your access code, please.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.387
I'll never...

25:15.555 --> 25:17.223
...give you the code.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.894
The psychological profile we have on you
says you will.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.522
However, if you wish to prove
the profile incorrect...

25:25.690 --> 25:29.485
...sit back and see what happens
when an intensely hot needle...

25:29.653 --> 25:34.031
...penetrates the lens of one
of the most beautiful eyes on earth.

25:34.241 --> 25:38.535
The needle point will pass through
the lens with very little difficulty.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.580
The heat will cauterize
and seal the wound.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.875
But the instrument will continue
to transfer heat...

25:45.043 --> 25:46.877
...to the fluid in the eyeball.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.548
The fluid comes to a boil...

25:51.716 --> 25:54.176
...and the eyeball itself explodes.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.596
J-B-N- 1...

25:58.723 --> 26:00.391
...2- 1.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.852
He can't use it.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.772
Why do you think he's doing this?

26:07.607 --> 26:09.358
Because he's crazy.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.860
You can argue that later. Next!

26:12.654 --> 26:13.946
Are we up for this?

26:14.990 --> 26:19.118
You can't hack into the system.
There are quadruple blocks.

26:19.286 --> 26:23.455
Even if he could, the codes
need to be entered simultaneously.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.918
There's not enough power here.
You've seen the ATAC generators.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.215
Oh, for chrissakes, it's impossible!

26:33.383 --> 26:34.925
You know that!

26:35.093 --> 26:38.304
The codes are different!
You can't use them anymore!

26:38.471 --> 26:40.973
It's no good! He can't use them!

26:41.808 --> 26:46.145
For God's sake, please, give him the code!
Give him the code!

26:46.688 --> 26:48.272
E-U-I...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.607
...4- 7-6.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.552
I not only invented Grazer,
I've updated it...

27:18.720 --> 27:23.891
...to use part of the electromagnetic
spectrum ATAC is only dimly aware of.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.768
What the fuck is that?

27:25.935 --> 27:29.980
As long as we're moving,
the signal is completely transparent.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.857
As you can see...

27:32.025 --> 27:35.694
...we're on a choo-choo.
No stop signs for six hours.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.947
ATAC would kill
to get ahold of this technology.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.783
In fact...

27:40.950 --> 27:42.826
...I'm sure they'll try.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.046
Works just as well underground,
underwater.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.146
I not only designed the system...

28:11.314 --> 28:12.731
...I designed the blocks.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.902
What're you doing, Dane?

28:18.071 --> 28:20.406
I'm hacking into ATAC, Linda.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.324
Now...

28:22.492 --> 28:25.035
...watch this.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.259
It's mine again.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.574
Shut the fuck up!

29:04.993 --> 29:06.285
We're locked.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.288
Oh, they're still here.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.499
I don't need them anymore.
They can go now.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.629
Move it, asshole!

29:17.797 --> 29:19.465
Come on, gorgeous.

29:19.883 --> 29:23.051
Don't you know that man's crazy?
Do you realize...?

29:23.219 --> 29:24.970
He's paying me a lot of money.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.388
That's why?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.024
It's okay.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.827
Goddamn it.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.668
Three hundred thousand pages
of code...

29:57.128 --> 30:00.297
...or 60 minutes of triple-X interactive...

30:00.465 --> 30:03.008
...rubber and leather bondage porno.

30:05.178 --> 30:08.180
Technology can be used for beauty...

30:10.016 --> 30:11.517
...or debasement.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.852
And until you plug it in...

30:14.020 --> 30:15.187
...you just can't tell.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.690
Oh, gee.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.026
I seem to have brought
the targeting codes.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.995
I want every window and door
locked and secured. Airtight.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.710
Shit.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.384
The train is secure.

30:45.593 --> 30:48.929
The major installation is T-minus 10.
The phone lines are two.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.307
We're sweeping the train for stragglers.
Excuse me.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.033
Okay, people, let's start the party.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.377
What's going on?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.381
Captain, give me a report.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.008
I'm still searching.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.969
Try this.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.263
- What is it?
- It's gone, sir.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.640
- What's gone?
- Grazer 1.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.769
What do you mean, it's gone?
Bring it up on the screen.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.605
It's like somebody took it.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.732
How could somebody take it?

31:41.941 --> 31:43.692
Nobody knows it's there.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.696
- Find the damn thing.
- We designed it to be undetectable.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.948
But not from us, for chrissake!

31:50.533 --> 31:54.369
I want a full systems-check,
and I want it in two minutes.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.705
We're in Code 2 status.

31:56.873 --> 31:57.873
Code 2.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.376
Gilder, Trilling and Tom Breaker, A.S.A.P.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.629
All right, let's move it!

32:04.088 --> 32:07.174
Mr. Penn, ATAC is now locked out
of their own system.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.302
Grazer 1 is fully under my control.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.392
I thought you were
those ugly men with guns.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.145
What are you doing?

32:20.313 --> 32:23.649
It was just a nice day for a stroll.
What's in here?

32:23.816 --> 32:26.985
It's the baggage car, but don't go in.
They shot at me.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.820
What are you doing?

32:29.030 --> 32:30.989
Trying to get killed?

32:31.157 --> 32:32.699
They have guns out there.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.493
Come here.

32:34.661 --> 32:38.747
- I ain't coming out there.
- Don't make me yell. Come here.

32:38.915 --> 32:39.998
Investors on the line?

32:40.166 --> 32:43.085
Clients from Asia and the Middle East
standing by, sir.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.920
Gentlemen.

32:45.088 --> 32:49.299
How are we today? How's the weather
out there? Sunny and sandy?

32:49.509 --> 32:52.302
Now, look, it's demonstration time.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.680
Some of you have trouble
with the idea of...

32:54.847 --> 32:58.141
...a non-terrestrially-originated
seismic event.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.604
But I want you to watch China
very closely for the next 10 minutes.

33:02.855 --> 33:05.357
- What's the problem?
- The system won't let us in.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.276
The system? What do you mean?
We are the system.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.321
- Any word from Gilder and Trilling?
- We're still looking.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.365
You lose them as well?

33:13.533 --> 33:18.453
Now the shit will really start to fly.
A fertilizer plant in Guangzhou.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.372
A fertilizer plant?

33:20.540 --> 33:24.710
Yeah, I'm going to shock the world
by spreading ca-ca all over the place.

33:25.169 --> 33:29.506
Guangzhou is a chemical weapons plant
posing as a fertilizer plant.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.008
We know this.
The Chinese know we know.

33:32.343 --> 33:36.304
But we pretend we don't,
and the Chinese pretend we don't...

33:36.472 --> 33:37.472
...but they know.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.307
Everybody knows.

33:39.475 --> 33:44.146
I'm gonna pull the brake cord,
stop the train and get the hell out of here.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.732
I'm going to die. I'm a porter.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.358
You're a fucking cook.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.695
You gotta trust me on this one, okay?

33:53.156 --> 33:55.407
Is there a phone or com unit here?

33:56.075 --> 34:01.079
There's a radio in the locomotive
and a pay phone downstairs in the lounge.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.748
I'll try to call the cavalry.

34:02.915 --> 34:08.335
Meanwhile, search the bags for a weapon
or something that can be used as one.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.922
I even touch a bag, I lose my job.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.632
I'm more concerned...

34:12.800 --> 34:16.428
...about the lives of these people
being held hostage.

34:17.429 --> 34:18.597
The hostages.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.389
I don't want them hurt.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.857
Now, pay close attention, Mr. Penn.

34:29.108 --> 34:33.402
I'm about to make the Bhopal disaster
look like a Girl Scout picnic.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.407
There. It's back.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.619
You see, it's nothing. A minor glitch.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.204
False alarm.

34:44.706 --> 34:46.248
What the hell is that?

34:46.417 --> 34:49.210
Poison gas, chemical fire...

34:49.378 --> 34:52.380
...total devastation for a 100-mile radius.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.966
Thousands of people are going to die.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.636
Listen and do what I say.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.054
Cover and concealment.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.515
Now you know as much as anybody.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.227
Right. Take that fucking
white jacket off.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.440
You touch me again, that's your ass.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.691
Targeting codes.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.736
- They've started our sequence.
- It's arming.

35:14.987 --> 35:18.323
This is nuts. There's gotta be
some kind of malfunction.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.450
It's being controlled elsewhere.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.954
Oh, Jesus, the target's mainland China.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.331
Not China!

35:26.582 --> 35:27.958
Not somebody nuclear.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.417
What's going on?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.680
Sweet Jesus!

35:41.848 --> 35:43.723
She's into acquisition mode.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.600
Somebody shut it down!

35:45.893 --> 35:48.353
They fired me. Took everything.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.355
She's powering up for a hit.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.274
Said the technology wasn't essential.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.359
Blow it! Shut it down!

35:56.028 --> 35:57.529
No response.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.573
They wanted it? They'll get it!

36:20.553 --> 36:22.220
That's what Dane used to say.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.557
Call Admiral Bates at the Pentagon.

36:26.726 --> 36:30.770
Admiral Bates is here in Colorado
attending an air show.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.607
Then get him here, now.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.749
Gentlemen, as you can see, it works.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.727
This is a one-time offer.

37:10.895 --> 37:14.105
Two hundred feet below the Pentagon
is an itty-bitty crack...

37:14.273 --> 37:17.484
...which I propose to make
great, big and wide.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.946
Directly above it
is a strike-hard nuclear reactor.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.573
It ain't hard enough.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.117
We'll take out the Pentagon...

37:26.285 --> 37:28.954
...and, God, Allah...

37:29.121 --> 37:30.789
...and the winds willing...

37:30.957 --> 37:34.125
...Washington and most of
the Eastern seaboard as well.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.763
The fee:

37:46.931 --> 37:49.140
One billion dollars.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.267
A billion dollars.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.063
I owe people money.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.940
Oh, shit.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.651
- What is this place?
- Here we go.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.820
I don't know, nor does Congress.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.948
What the hell is going on?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.368
Don't say this is a weather station.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.161
Bring the rendering up.

38:10.371 --> 38:14.457
Recently we deployed
a particle beam weapon into orbit.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.251
In English, please.

38:16.419 --> 38:20.797
It's a major cash cow. Particle beam
technology, it's the earthquake deal.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.717
It's my understanding
we shut that program down.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.429
We financed it.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.972
Breaker, what...?

38:30.016 --> 38:32.350
This goddamn thing works now?

38:32.685 --> 38:34.644
It works so effectively...

38:34.812 --> 38:38.690
...that if we targeted the Los Angeles
fault lines, in 15 seconds...

38:39.567 --> 38:41.901
...Arizona would be beachfront property.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.320
The problem is, someone else
is commanding the satellite.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.990
We couldn't find it or destroy it...

38:48.367 --> 38:50.660
...so we were unable to stop it.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.370
Oh, my God!

38:52.705 --> 38:53.997
China's earthquake?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.041
We have full deniability.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.835
- Holy shit!
- That's typical.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.672
Typical Agency bullshit!
Do you know who we're dealing with?

39:02.840 --> 39:06.885
We think it's Travis Dane,
the guy who designed the system.

39:07.136 --> 39:08.887
- One of our people?
- Not anymore.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.265
He was decommissioned.
Last month he was an apparent suicide.

39:12.433 --> 39:16.227
He's brilliant. He can do anything
he puts his mind to, but he's crazy.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.938
Why would you hire a maniac?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.482
Because...

39:20.649 --> 39:24.277
...sane people do not build
weapons like this.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.074
You'd think we'd learn from that.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.079
All right, we're upgrading to Code 3.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.624
Gentlemen, let's find the satellite,
and let's find the son of a bitch now!

40:13.452 --> 40:14.786
No power.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.794
Cover and conceal.
You know about that, right?

40:23.337 --> 40:25.255
You know about that, right?

40:40.813 --> 40:43.481
One of our customers has
a personal favor to ask.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.234
He wants you to blow up an airplane.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.904
Tell him to forget about it.
I'm going to blow up the Pentagon.

40:50.072 --> 40:52.157
He either gets on board
or gets left behind.

40:52.324 --> 40:55.743
But, sir, the gentleman's ex-wife
is on board this jet.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.335
He wants you to blow up a jet plane
going 500 miles an hour...

41:04.503 --> 41:08.006
...with a weapon designed
for subterranean strikes?

41:08.382 --> 41:11.718
He says he'll pay us
an additional $100 million.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.221
Really?

41:15.806 --> 41:17.807
What are its transponder numbers?

41:18.350 --> 41:19.851
Sending them now.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.021
I can do this.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.774
His ex-wife is history
when the money is in our account.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.152
Grazer 1 will be in position in...

41:30.571 --> 41:33.072
He has five minutes to make the deposit.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.216
The money's hitting Zurich now!

41:51.383 --> 41:53.509
Good. Here we go.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.393
Grazer's back on-line.

42:02.561 --> 42:06.522
- lf they hooked up, we're in trouble.
- Pegasus C Team is in range.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.734
We have a B-2 bomber
with two anti-satellite missiles onboard.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.618
I thought you cut the power downstairs.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.109
Pegasus locked on Grazer 1.
On your command.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.277
Fire.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.539
Can we get it before it fires?

43:05.124 --> 43:06.708
They are so slow.

43:22.933 --> 43:25.768
- Why is it still counting?
- Still getting the feed.

43:33.485 --> 43:34.986
Boom!

43:35.654 --> 43:37.989
Earthquake in midair.

43:38.490 --> 43:41.701
That is the goddamnedest thing
I've ever seen.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.998
Then what the hell did we shoot down?

44:02.973 --> 44:07.143
I'll ask you again, if we did not
shoot down Grazer 1, what did we shoot?

44:13.650 --> 44:16.027
Check on Herb, downstairs.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.041
Train noise eliminated
from transmission.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.794
Let's get ready to call home.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.379
What's up?

44:34.630 --> 44:36.547
- Where'd you get that gun?
- Get anything?

44:36.715 --> 44:38.549
Fishing rod, pool cue, clothes.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.551
You're a useless son of a bitch.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.888
Encrypted, no good.
This is a.45, okay?

44:49.561 --> 44:54.399
Dynamic tension, left hand, right hand,
palms pressed together, okay?

44:54.566 --> 44:57.568
Cover your ass, 12, 3, 6, 9,
wherever you look always.

44:57.736 --> 45:00.780
Never look in a direction
where the gun ain't pointing, understand?

45:08.038 --> 45:09.414
Who the hell is that?

45:09.581 --> 45:11.249
Jesus Christ!

45:11.583 --> 45:15.586
Not quite, General Cooper, although
I have sort of risen from the dead.

45:15.796 --> 45:18.423
No, it's just your old friend,
Travis Dane.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.259
You remember? The guy you fired?!

45:21.760 --> 45:25.096
And I bet now
you're probably asking yourselves:

45:25.347 --> 45:27.849
"What the hell did we just shoot down?"

45:28.016 --> 45:29.142
The answer is:

45:29.309 --> 45:33.896
The N SA's best and only functional
real-time down-looking satellite...

45:34.064 --> 45:35.648
...the N SP-1.

45:35.816 --> 45:40.445
You'll probably be calling them
any minute now, asking them for its use.

45:40.612 --> 45:44.073
Unfortunately, since even they don't know
where the fuck it is...

45:44.241 --> 45:45.616
...they can't help you.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.243
Have you got him?

45:47.411 --> 45:48.744
I'm closing in.

45:48.912 --> 45:52.206
You do know where
the last transmission came from.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.500
You're probably closing in fast...

45:54.668 --> 45:56.586
...on Grazer 1 's location.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.468
It's in there somewhere...

46:03.677 --> 46:07.680
...hiding among those 50 ghost satellites
I've created...

46:08.140 --> 46:09.807
...just for you.

46:12.478 --> 46:14.145
Motherfucker's gone.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.022
- Gone?
- I don't get it either.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.483
As my demonstration just proved...

46:18.817 --> 46:20.860
...Grazer 1 is Viable...

46:21.195 --> 46:23.362
...and can produce results.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.865
Reproducible results.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.658
And to prove it...

46:27.826 --> 46:31.662
...I'm going to give you
another demonstration.

46:31.997 --> 46:33.539
In 45 minutes...

46:33.832 --> 46:37.376
...as soon as Grazer 1
is in position for a clear shot...

46:37.794 --> 46:41.380
...I'm going to hit the Pentagon
with a 98-percent blast.

46:41.882 --> 46:46.344
Enough to fracture the nuclear reactor
you say you don't have under there.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.387
You son of a bitch.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.972
We'll have fallout.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.891
We'll have devastation.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.228
I've got things to do.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.235
I want you to remember:

47:02.528 --> 47:05.196
I was smarter than you
before I worked there.

47:05.697 --> 47:08.407
I was smarter than you
while I worked there.

47:08.867 --> 47:11.202
And I'm still smarter than all of you.

47:11.370 --> 47:12.662
Au reVoir.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.714
He sure didn't go this way.
We would've heard him.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.718
What are the odds
of tracking Grazer down in time?

47:27.970 --> 47:30.263
We should check over Paris.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.267
Considering the area we must cover...

47:34.434 --> 47:36.352
That's why it's called "space."

47:36.520 --> 47:38.437
What that, son? Speak up.

47:39.690 --> 47:40.856
Well...

47:41.024 --> 47:42.483
...I was just saying...

47:42.651 --> 47:45.611
...that's why they call it space,
because...

47:46.280 --> 47:48.197
...there's a lot of it.

47:48.949 --> 47:50.032
Thank you.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.784
Just be quiet, please.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.038
Where are you going?

47:56.206 --> 47:57.665
Front of the train.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.208
To look for the radio.

47:59.793 --> 48:02.378
Stay out of sight and don't get killed.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.298
Safety off...

48:05.465 --> 48:06.966
...dynamic tension...

48:07.217 --> 48:08.926
...aim, shoot.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.888
That's their ass now.

48:13.307 --> 48:16.392
Do you know what this is?
This is a Navy Cross.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.102
It's awarded for bravery.

48:18.270 --> 48:21.230
This is my father's.
Uncle Casey's got two of them.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.733
He's got medals that are so secret...

48:26.236 --> 48:28.654
...he can never show them to anybody.

48:28.822 --> 48:31.324
He won't let anything happen to us.

48:33.327 --> 48:34.952
I guess he's a hero.

49:12.783 --> 49:13.991
We have an intruder.

49:14.159 --> 49:15.660
Sweep the train.

49:15.827 --> 49:16.869
Do a sweep.

50:28.608 --> 50:29.734
Found our intruder?

50:29.901 --> 50:31.777
Negative. We're still looking.

50:31.945 --> 50:33.362
You clear?

50:35.615 --> 50:36.741
Checking.

50:41.538 --> 50:42.580
Nothing.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.583
We're clear here.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.042
Have you checked everywhere?

50:47.502 --> 50:49.044
Check on the roof.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.318
What the fuck?!

51:13.862 --> 51:15.988
- On top!
- He's on the roof!

51:36.676 --> 51:38.594
We're under fire!

51:39.179 --> 51:40.513
Go get him.

53:12.856 --> 53:16.108
I got him. He fell off
of one of the first cars.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.527
She said he fell over here.

53:20.238 --> 53:22.781
There's blood here. Here!

53:35.211 --> 53:38.589
She got him. He fell between
the first car and the locomotive.

53:38.757 --> 53:40.257
Is this a confirmation?

53:40.425 --> 53:45.137
He's hamburger. He's probably spread
about halfway across the state.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.058
We got him.

53:49.225 --> 53:51.769
But the son of a bitch took out six men.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.438
You stay here, okay? I'm going back.

53:54.606 --> 53:56.148
Be careful.

54:10.288 --> 54:12.164
You said these men were good.

54:12.582 --> 54:13.999
Who was he?

54:15.919 --> 54:17.962
What was he doing downstairs?

54:18.129 --> 54:20.589
The man is a soldier-of-fortune freak.

54:20.757 --> 54:24.343
Ran a war camp in Alabama.
They sat around playing paintball.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.345
That's not the whole story.

54:26.513 --> 54:30.432
The relationship between Penn and Dane
resurfaced during Desert Storm.

54:30.642 --> 54:33.560
When Dane apparently died,
we pulled surveillance off them.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.688
We're all aware of that.

54:36.022 --> 54:38.107
The connection is tenuous.

54:38.775 --> 54:41.193
Let me tell you what it really is.

54:41.361 --> 54:45.030
It's another classic example
of the CIA not doing their homework.

54:45.490 --> 54:46.699
Excuse me?

54:48.368 --> 54:52.162
In the last few years,
Penn developed a network of contacts.

54:52.330 --> 54:55.833
North Korea, here,
in particular in the Middle East.

54:56.001 --> 55:00.838
Best guess is this: If he's hooked up
with Dane, they got the money to do it.

55:01.798 --> 55:04.008
Why did he need power?

55:04.884 --> 55:06.135
The phone!

55:16.104 --> 55:18.647
Call Philippe, tell him to work tomorrow.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.065
Damn it!

55:21.359 --> 55:25.154
On second thought, he worked yesterday.
Call Antoine.

55:25.530 --> 55:26.822
You've been shot.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.992
No, there's no bullet.
No bullet in here.

55:30.910 --> 55:32.786
You think this is "been shot"?

55:32.954 --> 55:34.163
This ain't "been shot."

55:34.330 --> 55:35.622
Let's see here.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.335
Gigabyte of RAM should do the trick.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.755
We're in. What have we got?

55:45.216 --> 55:47.426
"Phone book, recipes.

55:47.844 --> 55:49.219
Chicken cannelloni.

55:49.387 --> 55:51.722
Fruit salad with crystallized ginger."

55:52.223 --> 55:53.474
Sounds good.

55:57.896 --> 55:58.896
Where are we?

55:59.064 --> 56:00.856
We're about right there.

56:01.441 --> 56:04.568
There, about 200 miles,
is where we come out the mountain.

56:04.736 --> 56:07.029
We're without phones for four hours?

56:08.740 --> 56:10.491
"Ryback's Tactics."

56:10.658 --> 56:13.160
- Ryback?
- That's what it says. Ryback.

56:13.328 --> 56:14.745
Casey-fucking-Ryback?

56:14.913 --> 56:16.455
Jesus Christ.

56:16.956 --> 56:19.291
Who's Casey-fucking-Ryback?

56:19.459 --> 56:24.213
Casey Ryback's a former SEAL Team
captain, a counter-terrorist expert.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.340
He was my instructor.

56:26.508 --> 56:27.758
He's the best.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.301
I thought you were.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.929
Did you see the body she shot?

56:32.097 --> 56:35.724
No, just a lot of blood.
If you get run over by a train...

56:42.148 --> 56:44.108
Did you see the body?!

56:44.275 --> 56:45.859
I assumed he was dead.

56:46.027 --> 56:48.278
Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.

56:50.323 --> 56:52.908
Every man resume a full train search...

56:53.076 --> 56:55.035
...inside and out, car by car.

56:55.203 --> 56:59.373
Including all AC ducting, all paneling,
the roof, undercarriage.

56:59.541 --> 57:01.959
Absolutely everything!
Right now!

57:20.186 --> 57:22.938
I can do this.

57:24.732 --> 57:26.775
You think he's alive?

57:26.943 --> 57:29.027
Until I have confirmation otherwise.

57:29.946 --> 57:33.157
What is he doing on my train
besides killing your men?!

57:33.324 --> 57:36.118
See if he's traveling with anyone.

57:38.997 --> 57:42.708
You said your million-dollar mercenaries
would be enough.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.293
They are.

57:45.170 --> 57:46.920
Come on, move it, Bobby.

57:56.848 --> 57:59.683
You picked the wrong place
to hang out with your legs spread.

57:59.851 --> 58:01.810
No, I'm hanging on right here.

58:25.376 --> 58:26.460
Plus one.

58:28.213 --> 58:30.214
Could be a girlfriend or child.

58:30.632 --> 58:32.090
Could be his wife.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.635
A man doesn't call his wife "plus one."

58:34.802 --> 58:37.221
So what? You looking for some babe?

58:38.389 --> 58:39.848
Some bait.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.438
What the hell?

58:47.106 --> 58:49.942
This isn't a produce list, this is...

58:51.861 --> 58:53.570
Oh, my God.

59:10.922 --> 59:13.465
Oh, shit.
Whose fucking blood is this?

59:28.439 --> 59:32.109
Go back to the lounge car.
Check the bar downstairs.

59:34.654 --> 59:35.904
What now?

59:40.243 --> 59:43.120
What am I doing? I'm making a bomb.

59:58.177 --> 59:59.803
What's he looking for?

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:01.972
Me.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.977
Your lunch?

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.647
When do I get some action?

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.901
We're going to take a bargaining chip
to protect the hostages.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.368
I want an evac order for the president,
and senior staff members...

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:26.288
...on an Alpha status now,
and try not to cause a panic.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.666
I don't think we have a chance in hell.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.461
Hi, honey. It's me.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:37.549
I want you to take Jamie, and I want you
to get out of Washington tonight.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.926
Go to your mother's.

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.678
Yeah, and...

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:43.347
...honey...

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.015
...don't tell anyone.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:10.791
What's your name?

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.751
Zachs. Bobby Zachs.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.546
You're not on the list.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:18.799
I'm an employee.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.510
Where's your uniform?

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.056
I'm deadheading, getting a free ride.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.485
Navy Cross.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.112
Mace.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.324
Not Mace...

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:45.909
...pepper spray.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.787
Sold to civilians.
Once you get used to it...

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.582
...it just clears the sinuses.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.084
Get her and let's go.

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:56.336
Let her go.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:05.804
Why do you need lighter fluid?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.806
It's like a detonator.

01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:27.826
Okay, Bobby, get in the elevator.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.662
I gotta go beep somebody.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.293
Imagine a fire
from New York to Charleston.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:38.628
We can do this.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.155
Put him out.

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.326
Get a man on the roof!

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:12.496
I need two more downstairs
in the next two cars!

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.332
The son of a bitch is using
the AC ducting!

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.668
Computer's down!

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.546
You and you, get to the baggage car!

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.174
Get him!

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.690
I got the CD.

01:03:40.858 --> 01:03:42.234
He's downstairs. Go get him.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:43.527
Go.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:46.279
Now.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:52.953
They have the CD!

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.376
The targeting CD!

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.253
I can't do anything without it!

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.847
- Let's go!
- Don't shoot the intruder. He's got the CD.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.392
Hold it right there!

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:23.817
Hand over the CD.

01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:28.572
They're off the train.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:30.240
Stop the train.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.888
Back up.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.537
This train...

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:21.875
...might as well be 20 tons
of scrap metal without that CD.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.595
Hold it!

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:42.979
Come on, move!

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.814
Hook up right here.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:48.818
Wait here.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.989
Safety off...

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.367
...dynamic tension...

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:58.328
Ass!

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:03.833
It's the porter.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.839
Check the porter!

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:25.689
You cocksucker!

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.357
He's got an accomplice!

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.901
It's a porter. We're on to him.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.031
Don't shoot him.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.366
He could also have the CD.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:38.576
Don't put a bullet in it.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.000
Tell me about the porter.

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:56.636
Hello.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:59.055
The CD. Hand it over.

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:00.390
Down there.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.901
Where did he go under the train?

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.903
Two cars up.

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:21.536
You pricks never learn.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.460
Freeze!

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:31.463
Get your goddamn hands up.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.923
Up where I can see them!

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.884
Where's that CD?

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:40.013
I ripped my pocket. It fell out.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.307
Don't bullshit with me.
Show me that CD...

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.309
...or I'll cap your black ass, bitch!

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:45.935
Empty your pockets.

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:47.687
Right now!

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.147
All right, man!

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:52.233
I'm just a kid. I'm just a kid,
I'm trying to tell you.

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:53.485
- Do it!
- I lost it there.

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:55.779
I ripped my pocket.
Everything fell out.

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:57.697
All I've got is your ass!

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.621
Porter checked.

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:16.966
Chance favors the prepared mind.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:23.430
Oh, shit.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.649
Take us west. Full ahead.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.444
Oh, shit.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.884
Your uncle wasn't as good as I thought.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.145
You're back on-line.
Now, get on with it.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:34.042
We haven't lost anything vital.
I have enough to do this.

01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:39.256
Houston, Tranquility Base here.
We are now at T-minus 20 minutes...

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:40.675
...and...

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.676
...counting.

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.680
That bastard started the countdown.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.433
Williams...

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.812
...eliminate orbits that don't offer Grazer
a shot at Washington in 20 minutes.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:54.522
We must eliminate all of them.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.400
- We only have one Pegasus left.
- We don't need one.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:10:01.529
On the last one, we lock on the satellite
and use the self-destruct.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.325
Make it happen.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.285
Start knocking them off.

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:23.885
- We've eliminated 22 possibilities.
- Excellent.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.553
Twenty-three.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.514
- A cook has a message.
- A cook?

01:10:28.682 --> 01:10:30.183
He says he has a Code 3 message.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.268
Patch him through on the audio.

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:42.737
Is Joint Chief of Staff Bates there, please?

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.614
This is Admiral Bates speaking.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:48.117
Sir, I have a fax message for you.

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:49.535
It reads:

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:52.538
"Admiral, a force of armed men...

01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:55.249
...probably numbering above 20...

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.962
...has taken over
the Grand Continental passenger train...

01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:01.589
...traveling from Denver to L.A.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.883
Key signature equipment of...

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:09.013
...high-bandwidth satellite transmission
equipment has been loaded on board."

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:12.392
- It's Dane!
- "Aggressors appear to be professional...

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:15.645
...and fully armed."
- Get me the exact location of that train.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.106
- Who sent the message?
- Casey Ryback.

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:21.567
Casey Ryback?
Casey Ryback's on this train?

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.277
What is he doing?

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.113
Leave it to Casey.

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.324
He's on vacation with his niece, sir.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:37.917
What's the closest air strike group?

01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.503
Stealth, sir, from the air show.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:42.338
Get them on their way.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.298
There's over 200 people on that train.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.135
There are over eight million people
in Washington.

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:51.931
Unless Ryback performs a miracle
in 18 minutes, I got no choice.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.226
Scramble the Stealths.

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.095
I'm disappointed.

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:35.475
I looked forward to going head-to-head
with the great Casey...

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.449
Man, that was good.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.704
Did he teach you that?

01:12:58.123 --> 01:12:59.290
Pity...

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:05.046
...you could have been very, very good.

01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:09.467
She's insurance, leave her alone.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.719
Ryback's gone, Dane.

01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:14.597
Did you see the body?

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.227
Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:22.230
It doesn't matter, she'll die anyway...

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.149
...with all the rest.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.822
Ryback may be dead, he may be alive...

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.991
...but he is not on this train.

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:22.456
I shouldn't have got back on this train.

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.211
Drop the gun.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.547
Drop it!

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:41.058
I never considered myself vicious...

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:42.393
...but you...

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.937
...you're like a cockroach!

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.066
So what do you do
when the bastard shows himself?

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.485
You squash him, right?

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.573
You get what I'm saying here, busboy?

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.242
I'm a porter...

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.077
...not a busboy.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:02.997
Okay, Mr. Porter...

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.792
...you got balls, man.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.920
So I'm going to let you decide.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.840
You want to see it coming...

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.094
...or you wanna turn around?

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:20.932
Say...

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.476
...want to help me?

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:35.905
Shit.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.032
You're a bad motherfucker.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.368
Let's go kick some more ass, though.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.584
Cool, man.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.421
Congratulations, gentlemen...

01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:54.507
...there is now one billion dollars...

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:58.386
...waiting for us in the land of banks,
cheese and cuckoo clocks.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.721
All we have to do now...

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.974
...is blow up Washington, D.C.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.600
That'd be the fire.

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:07.937
You will be picked up at the next stop.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.147
Thank you for your participation.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.945
It is sort of true.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:24.370
You're traveling through another dimension,
not only of sight and sound, but of mind.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:28.124
There's a signpost up ahead.
Your next stop:

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.001
Dark territory.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.469
Who says I have a one-track mind?

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.732
The town's on the wrong side.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.193
We're not on the right tracks.

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.697
We pass it on the inside,
not the outside.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.659
Where are they taking us?

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:09.165
8:00, Nevada Petrol Express.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:12.835
We're going to collide.
If we don't do something, we'll die.

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:15.171
That's a big motherfucker.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.257
It's got six locos up front,
about a mile long...

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:20.343
...and has 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.971
You won't let them get away with it.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.141
No, I'm going to get my bag of tricks...

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.728
...and we are going
to rescue these hostages.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.942
That's the Nevada Petrol Express.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:40.321
It's carrying 800, 000 gallons of gasoline.

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.323
Can't we contact them?

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:45.826
Not as long as they're in dark territory.
There's no reception in the canyons.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.245
When will they hit? Will it do the job?

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:52.375
It's going to be close,
but I don't think so.

01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:06.138
We're closing in, sir,
but there are 11 possibles left.

01:18:06.306 --> 01:18:07.890
Can you eliminate them in time?

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:09.266
No, sir.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:14.355
Foxtrot Flight, vectoring in on target.

01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:20.111
Greenlight the bombers.

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.321
Roger, Foxtrot heading 0.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.743
God forgive us.

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:34.083
Something's coming in.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.793
Intermittent signal, very faint.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.628
F-117s.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:39.839
Stealths.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.799
They found us.

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:45.052
- Casey-fucking-Ryback.
- Shoot them down.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.012
I'd have to unlock from Washington.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.766
I don't have the transponder numbers.
I can't target them!

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.893
They'd kill all the hostages.

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.166
Turbulence.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.960
If it moves, Grazer can see it.

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:21.422
They disturb the air
as they fly through it.

01:19:22.215 --> 01:19:25.468
Low-altitude turbulence,
that's how you find these things.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.387
There you are...

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:30.097
...Stealths.

01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:33.350
I can target these.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.730
Lady! What's taking you so long?

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.398
You've had your two minutes.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:41.525
We're the good guys.

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.618
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.828
- They split up.
- Is that a problem?

01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:55.456
I won't get Grazer onto D.C.
before it passes.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:56.874
Come out now.

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.043
I broke my bra.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.966
Tits to die for, huh?

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:07.760
Where are the hostages?

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:09.512
They're upstairs! Go!

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:15.142
You first.

01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:18.145
Say good night, Gracie.

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:26.195
Gotcha.

01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:14.702
- Ryback's hitting the hostage cars.
- Good old Ryback!

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:47.735
ATAC, Foxtrot 2.
Target locked on. I have tone.

01:21:47.902 --> 01:21:49.111
Going hot pickle. Over.

01:21:56.953 --> 01:21:59.622
- Goddamn, I'm good.
- Jesus.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:08.964
Get me the president.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:19.642
I'm coming to get my niece now.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.565
Come and get her.

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:32.696
Why are you bringing Ryback here?
Can you handle this?

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:36.617
Looks like you fucked up.
It's time to cut and run.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:40.996
Excuse me?

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:54.593
Anyone else think I fucked up?

01:22:58.181 --> 01:22:59.348
No.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.935
I got it!

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.937
The cars are separating!

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:14.279
- What are you doing?
- Coming to help you.

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:16.782
- You're a hero now?
- You're the hero.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.283
We're free!

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:29.545
You want to help? Climb up that ladder
and commandeer that helo.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.964
Are you crazy? Climb up there?

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.549
It might not work, but try.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:35.551
- Where are you going?
- The girl.

01:23:36.052 --> 01:23:38.554
Tranquility, this is Sparrow. Over.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:41.807
This is Tranquility.
Hold position as planned. Out.

01:23:47.772 --> 01:23:49.773
Hey, bring that ladder closer.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.526
Can't you see I'm trying to be a hero?

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.863
That's better.

01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:05.914
This is Sparrow. We made our first pickup.

01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:09.042
The hell you have.
Get up there and deal with that.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.201
What's going on?

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.749
Kick his butt!

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.845
Honey, we sure taught
that boy how to fly.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:03.680
We sure did.

01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:07.142
Now we're going to keep
this chopper right here.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:11.313
Or I'm going to blow your brains out!
You got that, honey?

01:26:28.474 --> 01:26:30.517
Let me handle Ryback.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.395
You take care of the techno shit.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.231
He's mine.

01:26:39.485 --> 01:26:41.778
I'll take him myself, hand to hand.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.867
Come on, my little ghost satellites,
I need you with me to hide my baby...

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.703
...so she can blow the fuck
out of Washington.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.539
Go get your throat ripped out.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:56.877
I got eight million people to kill,
and a billion dollars to pick up.

01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:04.468
Thank you, sir.

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:07.429
The president and the others
are evacuated.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:11.058
Leaving millions of innocent people
to die if we don't stop it.

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.226
We must use Pegasus now.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.103
But, sir...

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.942
...we still have eight possibilities.

01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:24.154
Pick one.

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:27.741
Now!

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.077
Kappa.

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:33.914
Thank you. Kappa's the target.
Stand by and launch.

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:41.672
I've never been afraid of anybody.

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.925
But that uncle of yours scares me.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.681
And I like it.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:43.108
It's you and me, or me and her.

01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:09.217
Now, you hold on real tight
and you'll stay in one piece.

01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:55.931
Fuck, you ruined my coat.

01:30:06.776 --> 01:30:08.026
Good morning.

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:03.266
Nobody beats me in the kitchen.

01:32:13.444 --> 01:32:17.197
I must go. Won't need any of this
anymore. Got everything I need...

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:18.865
...right here.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:21.243
The Petrol Express
will be here in a minute.

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:22.786
Have a nice life.

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:24.704
What's left of it.

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.919
You take one step
and I'm dropping this grenade.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.881
Okay...

01:32:35.841 --> 01:32:37.092
...then drop it.

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:00.782
Pegasus missed.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:02.993
It wasn't Kappa.

01:33:03.452 --> 01:33:04.619
Jesus.

01:33:14.797 --> 01:33:16.881
Shooting me won't do any good.

01:33:17.049 --> 01:33:19.634
ATAC can't get past my ghost satellites.

01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:23.096
And you can't get past
my encrypted program.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:26.099
You mean to tell me there's no way
I can shut that off?

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.309
No way.

01:33:39.238 --> 01:33:41.323
I never thought of that.

01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:42.490
It was Delta.

01:33:47.663 --> 01:33:48.663
We're locked on.

01:33:51.667 --> 01:33:53.001
Hit it!

01:34:45.304 --> 01:34:49.057
Hold the ladder at the top of the train.
And keep this chopper right here.

01:35:03.989 --> 01:35:07.659
Ryback, wait for me!
We make a great team!

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:42.444
I never doubted you.

01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:44.279
Oh, yes, you did.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.657
This is a real sweet
Hallmark moment, but...

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:50.535
...can we go home now, Uncle Casey?

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.583
This is Helo 505 November Mike.
Denver, come in.

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:59.210
Sir, there's a message coming in.
I'll patch it through.

01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:00.628
This is Casey Ryback.

01:36:00.796 --> 01:36:02.338
The hostages are safe.

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.968
He made it! Ryback made it!

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:37.011
