00:53.512 --> 00:54.972
Am I ready?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.140
Only you can answer that, sir.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.394
They're going to chuck
everything they've got at us.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.522
Then we shall have to chuck it
back, won't we, sir?

01:05.107 --> 01:06.942
Quite right.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.332
Now, there's no point in pretending
that this is going to be easy.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.835
How are you, Thompson.
Have you shaken that cold?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.795
- I'm all right, sir, thank you.
- Good man.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.674
We're nearly there, chaps.
Just hold fast.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.634
It won't be long now.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.553
We're with you, sir.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.888
I know you are, Wakefield.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.724
I can't tell you how much lighter
that makes the task.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.029
Right, Sergeant.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.156
Fix bayonets!

02:21.350 --> 02:23.018
Daisy, what's ever the matter with you?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.978
Someone walked over me grave.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.246
Forward!

02:45.582 --> 02:46.834
I'm so sorry.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.293
What happened?

02:48.377 --> 02:50.671
I don't know. I suddenly
felt terribly cold.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.679
I won't be sorry when this one's over.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.724
Sir!

03:36.133 --> 03:38.427
Milady, milady, wake up.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.180
- What on earth?
- You'd better come downstairs.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.933
I didn't know what else to do
when I saw the telegram.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.685
I knew it was urgent,

03:46.768 --> 03:48.645
so I hope it was right.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.439
Quite right.

03:50.522 --> 03:54.526
Mrs Crawley won't mind my opening it.
The main thing is, he's not dead.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.153
Not yet, anyway.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.489
They've patched him up. They're bringing
him to the hospital in Downton.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.867
- When do they think he'll get here?
- It doesn't say.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.494
But how do we contact Isobel?
And how will she get back?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.997
One thing at a time.
I'll ring the War Office in the morning.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.083
Maybe they know she's out there.
Perhaps she's with him now.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.002
They wouldn't have sent a telegram here
and she'd have rung.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.545
No, it's the usual balls-up...

04:13.670 --> 04:15.088
Usual mess up I'm afraid.

04:15.172 --> 04:19.843
Beg pardon, milord, but we're all
very anxious to know the news.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.304
Yes, of course.

04:28.143 --> 04:32.564
It appears that, a few days ago,
Captain Crawley was wounded.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.651
It's serious, I'm afraid,
but he's alive and on his way home

04:35.776 --> 04:37.152
to the hospital in the village.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.695
Where there's life, there's hope.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.739
What about William? Is he all right?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.908
I'll find out what I can tomorrow.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.743
I'm not sure there's
much more we can do tonight.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.412
William's father would have had
a telegram if anything had happened.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.164
I'll drive over in the morning.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.262
Whatever you discover, tell me.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.472
Don't keep anything back.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.376
Lady Edith's back.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.213
William was caught in it.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.175
He's gone to some hospital in Leeds.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.427
I'm very sorry.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.263
We might have known.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.223
We couldn't be the only household
left untouched.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.726
Will he come through it?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.270
Her Ladyship said it sounded bad,

05:54.188 --> 05:56.148
but we don't know more than that.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.902
Can you walk with me
to the church this afternoon?

05:59.985 --> 06:00.903
If you want me to.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.364
Because I'd like to say a prayer for them.
For both of them.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.743
We only cater for officers.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.371
Doctor Clarkson,
I am no Jacobin revolutionary,

06:11.455 --> 06:14.374
nor do I seek to overthrow
the civilized world.

06:14.458 --> 06:20.005
We just need one bed for a young man
from this village.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.341
And if it were within my power,
you should have it.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.593
Sir, you don't understand.

06:24.676 --> 06:28.555
William's father cannot afford
to leave his farm and move to Leeds.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.766
I'm very sorry, really,

06:31.517 --> 06:33.852
but this is a military hospital
and it's not up to me

06:33.936 --> 06:35.729
- to challenge the order of things.
- I'll nurse him.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.606
I'm happy to do it.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.316
It wouldn't add to your workload.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.026
If I were to break the rule for you,

06:41.109 --> 06:44.154
how many others do you think
would come forward to plead for their sons?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.242
The answer is, and must be, no.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.831
It always happens
when you give these little people power.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.292
It goes to their heads
like strong drink!

07:00.462 --> 07:01.839
I'm sorry for him.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.091
I am.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.384
I don't mind Captain Crawley.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.969
He's a better man than most of them.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.889
And William, too.
He's not a bad lad, whatever you say.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.353
I wish I'd not written that letter
to Bates' wife telling her he's back here.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.856
- What's that got to do with it?
- What with everything else going on.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.941
I know she'll come up
here and make trouble.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.193
Don't blame me. It wasn't my idea.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.447
Any news?

07:27.531 --> 07:30.492
Only that the doctor won't let
William come to the village.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
He never.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.037
It's for officers only, he says.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.499
And his poor father staying there with him,
spending money he's not got

07:37.583 --> 07:39.334
and traveling miles to do it.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.544
It's not right.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.296
No, it bloody well isn't.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.675
Well, I'm a working-class lad and so is he

07:48.177 --> 07:51.388
and I get fed up, seeing how our lot
always get shafted.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.269
I thought I'd take some things
down to the hospital.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.105
Then I can wait and sit with him
when he arrives.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.066
I've read somewhere that it's very
important not to leave them alone

08:03.150 --> 08:04.318
when they're first wounded,

08:04.776 --> 08:06.612
so no sign goes unnoticed.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.406
They can't spare a nurse
to watch over every man,

08:09.489 --> 08:10.741
so that's what I can do.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.411
Your mother's written to Lavinia.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.164
Good. Yes.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.333
I'm glad someone's thought of that.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.337
She must stay here
and not be at Isobel's by herself.

08:28.759 --> 08:29.843
What?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.222
Nothing.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.351
You should've had a church wedding.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.937
Don't be silly.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.270
No, I mean it.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.400
You in a white dress,
me looking like a fool.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.947
I'd rather have the right man
than the right wedding.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.117
Well, it won't be long now.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.538
How long?

08:59.373 --> 09:01.291
Hard to say, but don't worry.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.378
The decree nisi means we're safe.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.130
The decree absolute's
only a formality.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.885
I'm just sorry it cost so much.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.888
She could've had my shoes
and the shirt off my back,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.558
if it would only make her go away for good.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.810
She's gone now.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.400
I suppose I could feel guilty
in my happiness,

09:28.652 --> 09:30.821
knowing the troubles
they're all facing back at home.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.993
But in another way,
it only makes me more grateful.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.126
Let's pray, let's pray together.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.853
Don't worry.
The old lady'll sort something out

10:02.978 --> 10:04.855
now she's got the bit between her teeth.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.982
I'm not worried. Not in that way.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.026
I feel sorry for William, that's all.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.861
Well, of course you do. We all do.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.823
I expect you're glad, now,
that you let him have his little daydream.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.284
I'm not glad.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.121
I feel I've led him up the garden path
with all that nonsense,

10:21.705 --> 10:23.207
and I'm ashamed.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.043
I'm so ashamed.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.216
Oh.

10:33.884 --> 10:34.885
Shh.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.011
Hello.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.891
Mrs Bates, isn't it?
What do you want?

10:41.058 --> 10:43.894
Don't sound inhospitable,
Mrs Patmore,

10:44.019 --> 10:46.897
when I've only ever known
a welcome in this house.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.150
Yes, yes, the Minister.

10:51.235 --> 10:54.488
D'you... Well, how many Marquesses
of Flintshire are there?

10:57.741 --> 11:01.036
Is this an instrument
of communication or torture?

11:01.245 --> 11:05.040
What... Hello... D'you...

11:05.916 --> 11:06.917
Shrimpie?

11:08.085 --> 11:09.878
Yes, it's Aunt Violet.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.590
Yes... Very well, very... Yes...

11:13.924 --> 11:14.925
And Susan?

11:15.092 --> 11:16.176
Yes...

11:16.260 --> 11:17.886
Good.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.931
I won't beat about the bush, dear.

11:21.098 --> 11:26.687
Whom might we know
on the board of Leeds General Infirmary?

11:27.563 --> 11:30.232
Excuse me, it is not settled.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.360
It wasn't settled by me that you'd come back
here and take up with your floozy again.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.612
As far as I recall,
that was never settled.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.365
- How did you find out he was here?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.618
What does it matter?
Just say what you want. Spit it out.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.453
You thought you'd got the better of me.

11:43.579 --> 11:44.538
- But you were wrong.
- I never...

11:44.621 --> 11:45.956
I'm going to sell my story anyway,

11:46.081 --> 11:48.625
about Lady Mary,
about the Turkish gentleman,

11:48.709 --> 11:50.544
- about Miss Smith, here.
- It's got nowt to do with me.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.296
Well, that's not what I heard.

11:53.255 --> 11:56.466
You gave your word. I gave you the money,
and you gave me your word.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.887
Well, guess what? I was lying.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.221
If I hadn't come back to Downton,

12:02.639 --> 12:03.640
back to Anna,

12:04.141 --> 12:06.101
would you have stuck to our agreement?

12:07.102 --> 12:09.062
Well, we'll never know now, will we?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.273
You're angry because I'm happy.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.652
Maybe. But you won't be happy long.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.834
Can you drive me to the hospital?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.003
Aren't you needed here?

12:33.337 --> 12:35.172
I've already taken Lady Mary down.

12:35.297 --> 12:38.634
I know. I want to be with her
when Captain Crawley arrives.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.011
They can manage without
me here for a while.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.930
Is she still in love with him?

12:43.013 --> 12:44.640
I don't want to talk about it.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.809
Why? Because I'm the chauffeur?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.521
No. Because she's my sister.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.024
You're good at hiding
your feelings, aren't you?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.943
All of you.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.361
Much better than we are.

12:58.529 --> 12:59.613
Perhaps.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.448
But we do have feelings,

13:01.532 --> 13:03.492
and don't make the mistake
of thinking we don't.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.382
And has Lord Flintshire's
order been acted on?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.884
It has. There's an ambulance waiting,

13:21.176 --> 13:23.887
although no one quite knows
how you managed it.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.308
What exactly is the matter with him?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.310
His body sustained too much damage.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.396
He cannot recover.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.731
But he looks so normal.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.484
Appearances can be cruelly deceptive.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.362
The force of the blast
has fatally injured his lungs.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.573
But if he's lived this long?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.992
Would it make any difference
if he stayed here

13:45.158 --> 13:47.578
or are you just making him
as comfortable as can be?

13:47.744 --> 13:50.038
That's it.
There's nothing more we can do for him.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.000
So you agree with our plan?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.253
I don't know about you,
but I'd rather die in a familiar place,

13:56.378 --> 13:58.505
surrounded by familiar faces.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.009
There you are, Mr Mason.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.762
Seems we have everything settled,
and we'll be away before long.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.517
He'll be forced to do better, if we can
just get him back to where he knows.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.894
I feel sure of it.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.689
- I shouldn't.
- I shouldn't worry too much.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.983
We'll know much more when he's rested.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.777
I'm very grateful, milady.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.279
To both of you.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.780
Let's get him ready.

14:29.828 --> 14:34.166
See, sometimes,
we must let the blow fall by degrees.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.128
Give him time to find the
strength to face it.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.133
Right, they're here.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.968
May I stay to settle him in?

14:45.969 --> 14:47.012
Very well.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.430
I want to help, too.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.935
Lady Mary,

14:53.435 --> 14:55.604
I appreciate your good intentions,

14:55.687 --> 14:58.482
but I'm concerned
that Captain Crawley's condition

14:58.649 --> 15:00.108
may be very distressing for you.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.363
Might I suggest that you hang back until
the nurses have tidied him up a little?

15:04.488 --> 15:06.782
I'm not much good at hanging back,
I'm afraid.

15:07.157 --> 15:10.786
I won't get in your way,
I promise, but I will stay.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.205
You have volunteers, don't you?

15:13.872 --> 15:16.542
Well, that's what I am. A volunteer.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.669
All right.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.172
Everyone to their posts.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.507
You stand there.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.635
Yes, this gentleman's second in.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.803
Yes, Doctor.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.347
Number two, Nurse Crawley here.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.487
Yes, just here, gently, gently, gently.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.325
Take him under his feet.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.085
Cousin Matthew? Can you hear me?

16:00.210 --> 16:03.589
He is breathing, but he's not been
conscious since we've had him.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.175
They filled him full of morphine.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.593
Thank you.

16:13.557 --> 16:17.227
- What does it say?
- "Probable spinal damage."

16:19.188 --> 16:20.856
It could mean anything.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.232
We'll know more in the morning.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.694
What's this doing here?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.573
I gave it to him, for luck.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.618
He was probably carrying it when he fell.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.953
If only it had worked.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.079
He's alive, isn't he?

16:38.457 --> 16:40.167
I should wash him.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.376
This bit can be grim.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.962
Sometimes we have to cut off
the clothes they've traveled in,

16:44.213 --> 16:46.215
and there's bound to be a lot of blood.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.592
How hot should the water be?

16:49.551 --> 16:51.011
Warm more than hot.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.596
And bring some towels.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.744
You should never have told her
Bates was here.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.121
Don't I know it?

17:18.622 --> 17:21.165
And she was even worse
after she'd seen him than before,

17:21.290 --> 17:23.460
ranting on about a scandal
that would bring the roof down

17:23.585 --> 17:25.462
on the House of Grantham. Silly mare.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.297
What scandal?

17:28.924 --> 17:31.385
I thought she'd just come up
and take a bite out of Bates.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.636
That's what it sounded like.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.179
Then you should have asked more questions.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.598
You know what they say,
the devil is in the detail.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.810
Well, I'm not standing by while
she brings misery and ruin on milady.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.145
You started it.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.774
Oh, yes, you're very important, aren't you?
Very know-it-all.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.818
With all of us at your beck and call!

17:47.901 --> 17:50.988
I'm sorry if you're angry,
but don't take it out on me.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.281
You did it.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.579
Whom is she going to sell it to?

17:58.662 --> 18:01.957
She didn't say. Just that there was nothing
we could do to stop her.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.003
Mr Bates has given her every last penny
to Keep her quiet,

18:06.587 --> 18:10.090
but she's tricked him and now he's
got nothing left to bargain with.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.344
Well, we both know what I must do.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.516
But how can you ask Sir Richard for help
without telling him the truth?

18:20.517 --> 18:24.354
I'd rather he heard it from my lips
than read it over his breakfast.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.482
Suppose he won't do anything?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.445
Suppose he throws you over?

18:32.821 --> 18:34.156
That's a risk I'll have to take.

18:36.366 --> 18:39.036
I'll go up to London tomorrow afternoon.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.039
It's a request that demands
to be made in person.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.542
What about Mr Matthew?

18:45.626 --> 18:48.295
Miss Swire will be here
to keep him company.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.548
I think I can take some time off
to save my own neck.

19:03.352 --> 19:06.730
Why don't you go home now, Mr Mason,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.151
Are you sure you don't mind
sitting up with him?

19:11.235 --> 19:14.071
He won't be alone.
Not for a moment, I promise.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.581
He looks so perfect, lying there.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.761
But he does look perfect.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.098
Are you sure they've got it right?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.433
I'm afraid so.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.686
If only I weren't.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.282
Can you feel that?

19:59.908 --> 20:00.951
Mmm.

20:01.869 --> 20:02.870
What about that?

20:02.953 --> 20:04.037
NO.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.456
And that? Hmm?

20:09.126 --> 20:10.127
Nothing at all?

20:19.469 --> 20:20.971
Do they know any more, yet?

20:21.305 --> 20:23.223
They're examining him now.

20:23.307 --> 20:24.641
So he's conscious?

20:24.766 --> 20:25.934
Just about.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.312
Have they found out what happened?

20:28.437 --> 20:29.897
A shell landed near them.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.483
The explosion threw Matthew
against something.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.903
Go on.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.823
Doctor Clarkson thinks
there may be trouble with his legs.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.662
Not good news, I'm afraid.

20:45.913 --> 20:48.582
I'd say the spinal cord
has been transected,

20:48.665 --> 20:51.293
that it is permanently damaged.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.629
You mean he won't walk again?

20:54.838 --> 20:57.299
If I'm right, then no, he won't.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.347
It's a shock, of course,
and you must be allowed to grieve.

21:03.597 --> 21:07.184
But I would only say that he will,
in all likelihood, regain his health.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.020
This is not the end of his life.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.148
- Just the start of a different life.
- Exactly.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.487
Lord Grantham,
I wonder if I might have a word?

21:21.865 --> 21:24.451
Have you got a handkerchief?

21:24.701 --> 21:27.454
I never seem to have one in
moments of crisis. Thank you.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.042
You mean there can be no children?

21:32.793 --> 21:35.504
No anything, I'm afraid.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.300
But isn't there a chance that might change?

21:41.385 --> 21:44.721
The sexual reflex is controlled
at a lower level of the spine

21:44.805 --> 21:46.807
to the motor function of the legs.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.644
Once the latter is cut
off, so is the former.

21:54.606 --> 21:55.816
Right.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.573
Give them a moment together.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.661
What was Clarkson saying?

22:08.495 --> 22:10.330
Nothing to worry you about.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.339
My darling.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.923
If he could only see the child.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.092
He won't.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.552
I've written again and again.

23:05.636 --> 23:08.222
I've offered to bring him
to any place he wants.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.142
I wasn't going to tell you this,

23:12.559 --> 23:15.896
but he's coming on a visit this week,
to see his old pals.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.273
Help me, Mrs Hughes.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.984
Let me come to Downton
and show him the baby!

23:21.068 --> 23:22.903
Most certainly not. I won't allow that.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.988
Then ask him to meet me.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.157
I know he'd listen to you.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.992
I'll give you a letter.
One more can't hurt.

23:29.076 --> 23:30.410
Make him read it in front of you.

23:30.494 --> 23:31.828
I'll... I'll do no such thing.

23:31.912 --> 23:32.788
But, please.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.958
He'd say it was none of my business
and he'd be right.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.962
Besides, don't think I approve
of what you've done, because I don't.

23:40.087 --> 23:42.047
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

23:42.130 --> 23:44.508
Not on this scale, no, I have not.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.301
Sorry to disappoint you.

23:46.385 --> 23:47.928
So you won't do anything?

23:48.554 --> 23:51.223
I'm feeding you out of the house.
Quite wrongly, I might add.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.267
I've a good mind to stop that.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.936
Now I'm the one who's sorry.

24:04.111 --> 24:05.153
Now, go in.

24:05.279 --> 24:08.490
I don't know what to say.
It doesn't matter. He's dying.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.201
Just say nice, warm, comforting things.

24:11.285 --> 24:14.079
Make him feel loved.
You don't have to be Shakespeare.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.205
But...

24:17.040 --> 24:20.460
Here she is. Come over here,
where I can see you.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.887
By 'eck, it were worth it,
if I get to hold your hand.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.346
Don't be daft.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.932
I've never slept in a room as big as this.

24:34.892 --> 24:37.686
- Where are we?
- At the end of the South Gallery.

24:38.312 --> 24:39.438
Now, take this.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.482
Any news of Captain Crawley?

24:42.941 --> 24:44.234
He's doing much better.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.695
Thanks to you.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.165
Dad'll be here in a bit.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.583
Can you stay for a minute?

25:00.125 --> 25:02.377
I ought to go down.
It's not fair on Mrs Patmore.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.629
She won't mind.

25:04.338 --> 25:07.424
Because, I did want to ask you something.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.012
Daisy, would you ever marry me now?

25:12.095 --> 25:13.972
And not wait for the end of the war,
like we said?

25:15.349 --> 25:18.185
You mustn't worry about all that
for the moment now, William.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.480
You're here for rest not excitement.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.274
That's right.
There's no need to worry about it now.

25:24.358 --> 25:25.400
First, let's get you better.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.694
But would you think about it?

25:27.778 --> 25:30.572
I must go. They'll be sending out
a search party soon.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.324
Just rest.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.085
It would be very unusual.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.087
I know that.

25:45.546 --> 25:46.797
Of course it would.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.716
But I believe I could make it work.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.301
And if your child were ill?

25:51.426 --> 25:52.719
My mother knows what she's doing.

25:52.803 --> 25:54.263
She's brought up five of her own.

25:54.346 --> 25:56.974
- Even so...
- And they're only in the village.

25:58.976 --> 26:00.727
I'll discuss it with Mr Carson.

26:00.811 --> 26:03.021
There's nothing wrong
with your references,

26:03.355 --> 26:05.315
but of course they are
from before you were married.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.067
I'm a good worker.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.987
And I must earn.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.283
Matthew

26:17.828 --> 26:19.121
Matthew.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.966
Are you feeling a bit less groggy?

26:33.343 --> 26:34.511
Where's Lavinia?

26:35.179 --> 26:36.680
She's gone back to unpack.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.391
How's William?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.394
You know he tried to save me?

26:43.145 --> 26:45.189
He isn't too good, I'm afraid.

26:50.152 --> 26:51.403
Any sign of mother?

26:53.238 --> 26:54.364
Not yet,

26:54.448 --> 26:56.825
but I'm sure she's making
her way back by now.

26:59.912 --> 27:02.331
I've still got this funny thing
with my legs.

27:02.414 --> 27:04.082
I can't seem to move them.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.168
Or feel them,

27:06.752 --> 27:08.170
now that I think about it.

27:10.005 --> 27:13.884
Did Clarkson mention what that might be?

27:15.177 --> 27:16.762
Why don't we wait for Lavinia,

27:16.845 --> 27:18.514
and then we can all talk about it?

27:21.225 --> 27:22.267
Tell me.

27:22.893 --> 27:25.270
You've not even been here for 24 hours.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.148
Nothing will have settled down, yet.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.733
Tell me.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.030
He says you may have
damaged your spine.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.870
How long will it take to repair?

27:41.954 --> 27:44.957
We can't expect them to put timings
on that sort of thing.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.961
But he did say it would get better?

27:50.087 --> 27:53.465
He says the first task
is to rebuild your health,

27:54.258 --> 27:56.718
and that's what we have to concentrate on.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.266
I see.

28:02.933 --> 28:05.519
And he says there was no reason
why you should not have

28:05.602 --> 28:07.729
a perfectly full and normal life.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.650
Just not a very mobile one.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.909
Would you like some tea? I would.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.163
Thank you for telling me.

28:25.581 --> 28:26.498
I know I'm...

28:27.708 --> 28:28.959
blubbing, but I mean it.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.294
I'd much rather know.

28:32.880 --> 28:33.922
Thank you.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.008
Blub all you like.

28:37.092 --> 28:40.637
And then, when Lavinia's here,
you can make plans.

28:57.863 --> 28:58.780
Major,

28:59.865 --> 29:01.575
might I have a word?

29:13.086 --> 29:14.129
What is it?

29:14.546 --> 29:16.548
I have something for you.

29:18.550 --> 29:19.593
Thank you.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.346
I wish you would read it.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.764
Do you know who wrote it?

29:23.847 --> 29:28.685
Yes, I do. And I know
how anxious she is for an answer.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.563
With due respect, I don't believe
it's any of your concern.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.275
If you'd only...

29:36.693 --> 29:39.029
If you'd only see the child.

29:39.363 --> 29:40.656
He's a lovely wee chap...

29:40.739 --> 29:41.782
Mrs Hughes,

29:42.199 --> 29:44.326
the last thing I'd wish to be is rude,

29:44.409 --> 29:47.371
but in this case
I really must be left to my own devices.

29:49.248 --> 29:50.457
Now, I'll say goodbye.

29:51.416 --> 29:52.876
It's time I was making tracks.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.878
Goodbye then, Major.

30:03.804 --> 30:04.763
Who'd have thought it?

30:05.722 --> 30:09.101
The cold and careful Lady Mary Crawley.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.103
Well, we know better now.

30:11.562 --> 30:15.232
I'm surprised you haven't given me
some extenuating circumstances.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.233
I have none.

30:17.568 --> 30:20.737
I was foolish and I was
paid out for my folly.

30:22.489 --> 30:25.617
And when I've saved you, if I can,

30:26.076 --> 30:28.245
do you still expect me to marry you,

30:28.328 --> 30:29.413
knowing this?

30:29.913 --> 30:31.248
That's not for me to say.

30:32.624 --> 30:35.878
Of course, we both know that if we marry,
people, your people,

30:35.961 --> 30:38.839
will think you've conferred
a great blessing on me.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.425
My house will welcome
the finest in the land,

30:41.967 --> 30:44.928
my children will carry
noble blood in their veins.

30:46.138 --> 30:48.307
But that won't be the whole story, will it?

30:49.099 --> 30:50.601
Not any more.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.106
Sir Richard,

30:57.441 --> 31:00.360
if you think it pains
me to ask this favor,

31:00.444 --> 31:01.778
you'd be right.

31:01.862 --> 31:05.657
But I have no choice if I am not to be
an object of ridicule and pity.

31:07.159 --> 31:11.163
If you wish to break off our understanding,
I'll accept your decision.

31:12.289 --> 31:14.124
After all, it's never been announced.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.711
We may dissolve it
with the minimum of discomfort.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.963
Forgive me. I don't mean to offend you.

31:20.297 --> 31:23.175
I am simply paying you the compliment
of being honest.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.261
No, in many ways,
if I can manage to bring it off,

31:26.345 --> 31:29.640
this will mean we come to the marriage
on slightly more equal terms.

31:31.016 --> 31:32.684
I think that pleases me.

31:33.477 --> 31:36.813
- So you'll do it?
- I'll try to do it, yes.

31:37.814 --> 31:41.944
- You must act fast.
- I'll send a car for her as soon as you've left.

31:42.653 --> 31:47.157
Please let me know what it costs.
I'll find a way to reimburse you.

31:48.659 --> 31:50.327
Never mind that.

31:52.287 --> 31:56.124
As my future wife,
you're entitled to be in my debt.

31:59.336 --> 32:01.547
We've a bit of a conundrum, milord.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.799
As you may know,
we're short of a housemaid.

32:04.341 --> 32:07.845
We've had an application
from a local woman, Jane Moorsum.

32:08.178 --> 32:11.390
But she is married,
and she has a child, a son.

32:11.515 --> 32:15.519
- But surely her husband should be...
- She is a widow, milord.

32:15.978 --> 32:18.647
The late Mr Moorsum died on the Somme.

32:18.730 --> 32:22.985
There's no other earner, so she has
to look for work. I said I would ask you.

32:23.318 --> 32:26.989
Well, if Mrs Hughes agrees,
I think we must do what we can

32:27.072 --> 32:29.533
for the widows of our defenders.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.869
Very good, Your Lordship.

32:35.706 --> 32:36.957
What was that?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.667
We're taking on a new maid.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.460
He should have talked to me, not you.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.754
They thought you were too busy
to be bothered with it.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.715
Well, I am busy.

32:45.215 --> 32:48.677
And that reminds me,
I can't come with you to the Townsends.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.554
You'll have to make some excuse.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.890
But we gave them the date.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.226
You'll think of something.

32:58.562 --> 33:02.274
You always said I wouldn't
have to marry him when it came to it.

33:02.399 --> 33:06.403
Daisy, he's dying.
What difference does it make?

33:06.486 --> 33:09.990
All the more reason.
I can't lie to him at the end.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.117
Don't make me be false to a dying man.

33:12.242 --> 33:16.955
What matters now is the poor lad knows some
peace and some happiness before he goes.

33:17.664 --> 33:18.957
I can't.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.085
I don't care if you can't walk.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.923
You must think me very feeble if you
believe that would make a difference.

33:26.924 --> 33:29.426
I know it wouldn't.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.806
And I love you so much for saying it.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.600
But there is something else

33:37.684 --> 33:39.686
which may not have occurred to you.

33:40.938 --> 33:42.940
This is very difficult...

33:46.944 --> 33:50.781
We can never be properly married.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.825
What? Of course we can be married.

33:54.785 --> 33:56.286
Not properly.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.209
Oh.

34:03.836 --> 34:04.878
I see.

34:06.046 --> 34:09.800
That's why I have to let you go.

34:12.553 --> 34:15.806
But, that side of things,

34:15.889 --> 34:17.599
it's not important to me, I promise.

34:17.683 --> 34:20.853
My darling, it's not important now.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.728
But it will be,

34:24.188 --> 34:25.649
and it should be.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.987
And I couldn't possibly be responsible

34:32.197 --> 34:35.576
for stealing away the
life you ought to have.

34:36.243 --> 34:40.956
I won't leave you. I know you think I'm
weak, and I don't know what I'm taking on.

34:41.039 --> 34:43.125
How could you? For God's sake.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.878
I'm not saying it'll be
easy for either of us.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.755
But just because a life isn't easy
doesn't mean it isn't right.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.175
I won't tight with you.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.181
But I won't steal away your life.

34:59.725 --> 35:01.185
Go home.

35:01.602 --> 35:03.228
Think of me as dead.

35:05.022 --> 35:06.773
Remember me as I was.

35:15.199 --> 35:19.203
Mary's telephoned. She'll be on a late train.
It gets in at 11:00.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.038
All right.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.540
How's William?

35:25.292 --> 35:30.255
It's so sad. Edith's taking care of him,
but there's nothing to be done.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.382
We're waiting, really.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.053
What is it?

35:37.596 --> 35:39.223
They shot the Tsar.

35:40.140 --> 35:41.600
And all of his family.

35:42.726 --> 35:43.936
How terrible.

35:44.061 --> 35:46.772
I'm sorry. I'll not deny it.

35:50.067 --> 35:51.777
I never thought they'd do it.

35:52.569 --> 35:56.073
But sometimes the future
needs terrible sacrifices.

35:57.115 --> 35:58.659
You thought that, once.

35:58.742 --> 36:00.536
If you mean my politics,

36:00.619 --> 36:03.372
you know we've agreed to put that
to one side until the war is won.

36:03.455 --> 36:07.334
Your lot did, but Sylvia Pankhurst
was all for fighting on.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.670
Oh, don't badger me, please.

36:15.926 --> 36:19.638
Sometimes a hard sacrifice must
be made for a future that's worth having.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.974
That's all I'm saying.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.476
That's up to you.

36:35.779 --> 36:38.991
You understand it would
have to be exclusive?

36:39.324 --> 36:42.786
I couldn't have you peddling different
versions of the story to my competitors?

36:43.203 --> 36:44.538
Of course I understand.

36:44.621 --> 36:47.249
But I can't help it if they pick it up
once you've published it.

36:47.332 --> 36:50.836
Indeed you can't. No more can I.
But I would control the timing.

36:51.670 --> 36:54.965
You'd have to sign a binding contract
to that effect, today.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.425
I expected that.

36:56.508 --> 37:00.387
And I warn you, I am unforgiving
when anyone breaks a contract with me.

37:01.471 --> 37:04.224
One word out of place
and you'd find yourself in court.

37:04.474 --> 37:06.476
I expected that, too.

37:07.144 --> 37:09.813
But I'm curious.
How did you hear about me?

37:11.148 --> 37:13.525
I know everything that
goes on in this city.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.360
And what's the hurry?

37:15.485 --> 37:17.321
I'm a newspaper man.

37:17.821 --> 37:21.200
When I hear of something good,
I have to make sure of it straight away.

37:21.491 --> 37:22.910
I'm sorry if I rushed you.

37:23.493 --> 37:24.661
That's all right.

37:25.871 --> 37:30.542
You must dislike the Crawleys very much to
want to subject them to trial by scandal.

37:31.335 --> 37:34.755
My husband works for them.
We are not on good terms.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.597
How is he?

37:44.723 --> 37:48.769
His father's with him now
and he seems to understand the situation.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.187
Poor man.

37:50.854 --> 37:53.607
Daisy, William's asking to see you.

37:54.650 --> 37:57.194
I can't go. Don't make me go.

37:57.694 --> 38:00.113
Do you care so little for him?

38:00.364 --> 38:01.865
It's not that.

38:02.324 --> 38:05.994
I'm very fond of William, and I'm very sad.

38:06.954 --> 38:10.541
But I've led him on and led him on
and made him think things that aren't true.

38:10.624 --> 38:14.211
But he wanted them to be true.
He was happy to think they were true.

38:14.336 --> 38:16.588
But that doesn't make it all right.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.842
Shall I tell him you won't come?

38:42.573 --> 38:44.491
Will you leave us a moment, Dad?

38:55.669 --> 38:57.546
There's no need to make him leave.

38:57.629 --> 38:58.922
There is a need.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.049
Come here.

39:11.268 --> 39:12.519
You know I'm dying?

39:12.603 --> 39:14.771
- You don't...
- I'm dying, Daisy.

39:17.566 --> 39:18.984
I'm not going to make it,

39:20.903 --> 39:22.321
and I don't have long.

39:24.740 --> 39:27.284
That's why you've got to marry me.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.745
- What?
- No, listen.

39:31.622 --> 39:33.832
You'll be my widow.

39:35.042 --> 39:38.587
A war widow with a pension and rights.

39:40.172 --> 39:41.798
You'll be looked after.

39:42.799 --> 39:44.134
It won't be much,

39:45.677 --> 39:49.640
but I'll know you've got something
to fall back on.

39:51.767 --> 39:53.727
Let me do that for you, please.

39:53.810 --> 39:55.395
I can't.

39:56.647 --> 40:00.734
It would be dishonest.
Almost like cheating.

40:01.401 --> 40:02.861
But it's not cheating.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.447
We love each other, don't we?

40:06.949 --> 40:10.702
We'd have married if I'd got through it,
and spent our whole lives together.

40:12.538 --> 40:14.206
Where's the dishonesty in that?

40:30.806 --> 40:32.933
He's asked you, hasn't he?

40:34.017 --> 40:35.269
I knew he would.

40:36.562 --> 40:38.355
You'll do it, won't you?

40:39.064 --> 40:41.733
I don't think he should be
bothering about it now.

40:42.818 --> 40:44.736
What else should he be bothered with?

40:45.737 --> 40:49.408
You're the most important thing
on earth to him, Daisy.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.412
You wouldn't disappoint him, would you?

40:54.204 --> 40:57.040
Suppose the vicar won't do it?

40:57.541 --> 41:00.502
He may want to wait 'til William's
well enough to go to church.

41:02.713 --> 41:04.923
But that time's not coming, is it?

41:14.308 --> 41:15.601
Lavinia?

41:22.441 --> 41:24.651
You're back.

41:25.277 --> 41:26.653
How did you get on?

41:27.571 --> 41:29.364
All right, I think.

41:31.241 --> 41:32.201
How about you?

41:33.243 --> 41:35.537
Matthew's told me to go home.

41:37.831 --> 41:39.333
He says he won't see me again.

41:41.210 --> 41:44.296
He feels he has to "set
me free," as he put it.

41:47.674 --> 41:50.010
I've tried to tell him I don't care,
but he won't listen.

41:51.678 --> 41:53.514
Then you must keep telling him.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.560
Yes, but you see, it isn't
just not walking...

42:01.230 --> 42:04.942
Today he told me we could never
be lovers because all that's gone as well.

42:05.025 --> 42:10.572
I didn't realize. It's probably obvious to
anyone with a brain, but I didn't realize.

42:12.574 --> 42:13.617
No.

42:16.703 --> 42:18.247
No, nor did I.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.837
And he feels it would be
a crime to tie me down,

42:24.920 --> 42:28.507
to tie down any woman
to the life of a childless nun.

42:30.509 --> 42:32.678
He thinks I'd hate him in the end.

42:37.432 --> 42:39.184
I'm sorry if I've shocked you.

42:39.268 --> 42:42.104
But there's no one else I could talk to
about it, and when you came in, I...

42:42.187 --> 42:43.981
I'm not shocked.

42:45.065 --> 42:46.191
I'm just stunned.

42:48.110 --> 42:49.570
And desperately sad.

42:51.613 --> 42:53.574
I'll die if I can't be with him.

43:00.873 --> 43:02.624
Good God almighty!

43:02.708 --> 43:06.336
"The engagement is announced between
Lady Mary Josephine Crawley,

43:06.420 --> 43:10.215
"eldest daughter of the Earl and Countess
of Grantham, and Sir Richard Carlisle,

43:10.299 --> 43:14.887
son of Mr and the late Mrs Mark Carlisle
of Morningside, Edinburgh."

43:15.888 --> 43:17.514
Is this why you went to see him?

43:17.598 --> 43:19.099
Why didn't you say it'd
be in today's paper?

43:19.183 --> 43:20.225
I didn't know.

43:20.309 --> 43:22.019
Well, surely he asked your permission?

43:22.102 --> 43:24.897
I don't think asking permission
is his strongest suit.

43:25.814 --> 43:29.109
That's very high-handed.
You can't let him get away with it.

43:29.234 --> 43:31.069
Well, it's done now.

43:31.361 --> 43:32.446
What is it?

43:32.529 --> 43:36.158
William's wedding, milord.
If it can be arranged for this afternoon,

43:36.241 --> 43:38.202
the indoor staff would like to attend.

43:38.285 --> 43:40.704
We don't yet know
if Mr Travis will agree to do it.

43:40.787 --> 43:43.624
I'm afraid he has very little time
to make up his mind.

43:48.962 --> 43:54.343
This boy is an extremist. How can we know
that these are his true wishes?

43:54.760 --> 43:59.348
Maybe the kitchen maid somehow
hopes to catch at an advantage?

43:59.431 --> 44:01.642
And what advantage would that be?

44:02.142 --> 44:05.479
Some widow's dole
given by a grateful nation?

44:05.729 --> 44:09.233
Mr Travis, can I remind you,

44:09.483 --> 44:13.195
William Mason has served our family well.

44:13.570 --> 44:18.575
At the last he saved the life,
if not the health, of my son's heir.

44:19.201 --> 44:24.122
Now, he wishes, before he dies,
to marry his sweetheart.

44:24.206 --> 44:25.707
- Yes, but.
- You cannot imagine

44:25.791 --> 44:28.460
that we would allow you
to prevent this happening,

44:28.544 --> 44:31.964
- in case his widow claimed her dole.
- No, but...

44:32.047 --> 44:34.424
I have had an interest in this boy.

44:34.508 --> 44:38.303
I tried and failed
to save him from conscription,

44:38.804 --> 44:42.099
but I will certainly attend his wedding.

44:43.058 --> 44:46.061
- Is that an argument in its favor?
- Of course, but.

44:46.144 --> 44:51.650
Finally, I would point out,
your living is in Lord Grantham's gift,

44:52.025 --> 44:55.070
your house is on Lord Grantham's land,

44:55.153 --> 44:59.199
and the very flowers in your church
are from Lord Grantham's garden.

45:00.033 --> 45:02.202
I hope it is not vulgar in me

45:02.286 --> 45:06.748
to suggest that you find some way
to overcome your scruples.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.211
But you can't have expected much more.

45:11.712 --> 45:14.923
Not when those letters all went unanswered.

45:16.049 --> 45:18.886
I don't know what I expected,
but you can't help hoping.

45:22.848 --> 45:24.892
Have you found any work?

45:26.518 --> 45:27.936
A bit of scrubbing.

45:29.396 --> 45:31.815
There aren't many places
I can take the baby.

45:33.859 --> 45:35.527
What do you tell them?

45:36.737 --> 45:39.114
That my husband died at the front.

45:42.826 --> 45:46.455
It's funny. We have a new maid, Jane,

45:47.247 --> 45:51.460
who really is a war widow,
with a child, and we respect her for it.

45:52.503 --> 45:55.214
But then, we believe her story.

45:59.176 --> 46:02.429
- Mrs Bates, I really must insist...
- You tricked me!

46:02.971 --> 46:04.848
Well? Aren't you going to deny it?

46:04.932 --> 46:08.644
Certainly not. I tricked you
to protect my fiancée's good name.

46:08.769 --> 46:10.771
That's one word for her.
I can think of a few others.

46:10.854 --> 46:13.607
You'd better not speak them aloud
if you know what's good for you.

46:13.690 --> 46:16.401
I don't want your money.
I don't want that contract.

46:16.485 --> 46:17.945
It's too late for that.

46:18.028 --> 46:22.741
And I warn you, if I so much as read her
name in anything but the court circular,

46:22.908 --> 46:27.120
I shall hound you and ruin you
and have you locked up. Is that clear?

46:31.166 --> 46:34.294
It doesn't end here, you know.
Not for John Bates.

46:34.545 --> 46:39.049
Lady Mary might have got away,
what do I care? But he won't.

46:39.132 --> 46:40.467
You tell him.

46:41.552 --> 46:43.387
That's entirely your own affair.

46:51.061 --> 46:52.729
Where do we start?

46:52.855 --> 46:53.981
You tell me.

46:54.064 --> 46:57.693
Oh, Your Lordship, I do apologise.

46:57.818 --> 46:59.987
I thought Mrs Hughes said
we were to clean in here.

47:00.070 --> 47:01.405
You must be the new maid.

47:03.407 --> 47:05.742
I am. Jane.

47:06.660 --> 47:09.538
And it's very kind of you
and Her Ladyship to take me on.

47:09.830 --> 47:13.584
Not a bit.
We all owe your late husband a great debt.

47:17.004 --> 47:18.380
Thank you.

47:19.089 --> 47:22.676
Milord, there's a telephone
call for... Jane?

47:22.926 --> 47:24.344
Whatever are you doing?

47:24.428 --> 47:26.346
You're wanted in the drawing room,
not the library.

47:26.430 --> 47:28.765
To clean it while the men are out of it.

47:29.558 --> 47:32.436
She's very willing,
but she's not quite there yet. I am sorry.

47:32.728 --> 47:35.189
Oh, don't be. What about that call?

47:35.272 --> 47:37.774
For Lady Mary. They're waiting now.

47:37.900 --> 47:40.903
You might just catch her if you hurry-
She's on her way to the hospital.

47:52.289 --> 47:55.417
His Lordship asked Mr Bassett
to bring these in for you.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.711
Ah, how lovely.

47:59.546 --> 48:01.465
Here, Daisy, sit down

48:03.133 --> 48:06.053
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's just a lie. You know it is.

48:06.970 --> 48:08.972
You're doing it
out of the goodness of your heart.

48:09.306 --> 48:11.558
The falseness of my heart, more like.

48:12.601 --> 48:14.811
She's not quite the blooming bride.

48:14.937 --> 48:17.314
I don't think it's the same
when you're marrying a corpse.

48:17.397 --> 48:18.815
- Are you going?
- Why not?

48:18.941 --> 48:20.817
I wouldn't mind shaking William's hand
before he goes.

48:23.445 --> 48:26.615
Is that sentiment or superstition,
in case he haunts you?

48:31.328 --> 48:32.788
You look lovely, dear.

48:34.331 --> 48:36.750
Just to say the vicar is ready for us.

48:39.169 --> 48:40.587
Let's go up, then.

49:03.777 --> 49:05.362
Dearly beloved,

49:05.821 --> 49:10.784
we are gathered together here in the sight
of God and to the face of this congregation,

49:11.535 --> 49:15.372
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony,

49:16.206 --> 49:21.461
which is an honorable estate instituted by
God which in the time of man's innocency,

49:22.004 --> 49:25.007
signifying unto us the mystical union...

49:27.718 --> 49:33.390
If any man can show any just cause why
they may not lawfully be joined together,

49:33.891 --> 49:39.521
let them now speak
or else hereafter forever hold his peace...

49:47.738 --> 49:49.531
Have you the ring?

50:12.054 --> 50:13.639
I have a cold.

50:13.972 --> 50:16.266
You may now kiss the bride.

50:29.988 --> 50:32.157
She's better off in London.

50:32.783 --> 50:34.326
If you say so.

50:35.619 --> 50:38.080
Do you know why I sent her away?

50:38.163 --> 50:39.623
I think so.

50:41.667 --> 50:44.294
Then you'll know I couldn't marry her.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.255
Not now.

50:47.923 --> 50:49.508
I couldn't marry any woman.

50:49.842 --> 50:54.346
And if they should just want to
be with you? On any terms?

50:55.347 --> 50:58.642
No one sane would want to
be with me as I am now.

51:00.978 --> 51:02.771
Including me.

51:03.856 --> 51:06.817
Oh, God, I think I'm going to be sick.

51:10.028 --> 51:12.531
It's all right.

51:13.824 --> 51:15.200
It's perfectly all right.

51:23.876 --> 51:25.335
What is it?

51:27.963 --> 51:31.425
I was just thinking. It seems such
a short time ago since I turned you down.

51:31.508 --> 51:32.801
And now look at me.

51:33.343 --> 51:36.889
An impotent cripple, stinking of sick.
What a reversal.

51:39.224 --> 51:41.143
You have to admit it's quite funny.

51:42.519 --> 51:46.481
All I'll admit is that you're here
and you've survived the war.

51:47.524 --> 51:48.859
That's enough for now.

52:00.704 --> 52:03.373
You're back. He'll be so pleased.

52:05.459 --> 52:07.920
You've become quite a nurse
since I last saw you.

52:08.295 --> 52:11.715
Oh, no. It's nothing.
Sybil's the nurse in this family.

52:12.591 --> 52:14.927
It is the very opposite of nothing.

52:23.602 --> 52:24.895
Mother.

52:33.570 --> 52:37.616
Bates, what's happened? How's William?

52:39.076 --> 52:41.245
He's nearly there, milady.

52:41.578 --> 52:43.121
I am so sorry.

52:44.623 --> 52:47.334
Actually, Bates, I'm glad I've caught you.

52:48.126 --> 52:50.671
Sir Richard Carlisle telephoned me earlier.

52:51.088 --> 52:53.507
He says he's paid Mrs Bates for her story.

52:53.590 --> 52:55.884
She cannot speak of it now
without risking prison.

52:55.968 --> 52:57.261
She won't do that.

52:58.512 --> 53:00.430
So I hope we can all forget it.

53:00.514 --> 53:02.307
It's forgotten already, milady.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.977
Thank you.

53:06.103 --> 53:09.481
I'm afraid she was very angry
when she knew she had been silenced.

53:10.941 --> 53:12.317
I can imagine.

53:12.609 --> 53:14.820
He says she made threats against you.

53:15.487 --> 53:18.448
"If I go down, I'll take him with me."
That sort of thing.

53:18.949 --> 53:20.367
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

53:20.826 --> 53:22.494
Are you, milady?

53:23.287 --> 53:26.373
Well, you'd know better than I.

53:35.966 --> 53:37.384
Lady Mary's back.

53:37.467 --> 53:41.972
I've just seen her. She says it's worked.
Sir Richard has put a gag on Vera.

53:42.973 --> 53:44.391
Thank God.

53:45.142 --> 53:47.311
So everything in our garden is rosy again?

53:48.020 --> 53:50.397
I hope so. I certainly hope so.

54:13.587 --> 54:15.923
You must be so tired, my lamb.

54:16.340 --> 54:19.218
Why not let me take over for a while,
and go and lie down?

54:19.593 --> 54:22.221
No, thank you, Mrs Patmore.
I'll stay with him.

54:22.721 --> 54:24.932
I won't leave him now.
Not while he needs me.

54:26.016 --> 54:28.185
He doesn't need you no more, Daisy.

54:32.564 --> 54:34.608
He doesn't need none of us no more.
