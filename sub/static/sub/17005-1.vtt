00:01.920 --> 00:04.354
I was born here, didn't like it...

00:04.600 --> 00:05.715
...moved away.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.029
Figured out the part
I didn't like was me.

00:08.280 --> 00:11.078
So I worked on that,
and I moved back.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.672
I got my first kiss right here.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.354
Sammy Jenks.
Gave him a black eye.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.318
You did? How hard?

00:21.960 --> 00:23.393
That's what love'll do.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.351
I have trouble picturing what kind of
woman you'd take the trouble to marry.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.398
First love situation.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.113
We got married a week after graduating
college, if you can believe that.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.588
So what happened?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.432
You want to hear my sob story?

00:41.680 --> 00:44.911
I think she thought
she was marrying Norman Mailer.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.432
She thought I'd be famous.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.471
After the book was published, she'd wake
up at the crack of dawn on Sunday...

00:52.720 --> 00:54.950
...make coffee, cross her fingers...

00:55.200 --> 00:58.351
...and look in that Sunday <i>Times,</i>
sure it was going to be a bestseller.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.759
One Sunday, she didn't wake up early,
didn't make coffee...

01:03.000 --> 01:04.831
...didn't cross her fingers...

01:06.000 --> 01:07.194
...and I knew.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.913
She left you
because your book wasn't a hit?

01:11.680 --> 01:15.150
I don't know, Kelso.
It seems pretty shallow to me.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.872
What about you and Joe Odom?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.279
Me and Joe.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.158
We're just friends.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.034
We have a real musical relationship.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.797
We're like the Steve and Eydie
of Savannah.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.032
My God, it's quiet.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.310
Too quiet.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.074
Joe'll be playing at that bar
until dawn.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.673
I should probably go.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.158
In case you're wondering,
this is the perfect time for a kiss.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.550
Sammy Jenks warned me about you.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074

02:21.080 --> 02:22.149
Good night.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.069
Ladies and gentlemen,
you constitute our jury for this trial.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.072
It's expected to last several days.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.992
I'll let you go home for the evening...

02:37.240 --> 02:41.279
...instruct you to be back
in the morning at 9:30 in the jury room.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.273
If anybody tries to approach you
about this case...

02:44.520 --> 02:46.988
...report it to me
the first thing in the morning.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.437
You're excused for the evening.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.834
Mr. Driggers, let me speak to you.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.192
Luther, listen.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.750
This is a courtroom. Don't bring
those flies in here tomorrow.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.710
And leave that vial of water,
or whatever that stuff is, at home.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.469
Sam...

03:12.800 --> 03:16.793
...you know, when we were in Georgia,
I know how you hated my bugs...

03:17.040 --> 03:18.758
...and you know how I love them.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.715
We're no longer at the university.
This is a courtroom.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.430
I'm telling you to leave
all that foolishness at home.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.476
I do take umbrage.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.439
But I'll do it.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.120
What is the story with the guy
with the horsefly epaulets?

03:34.360 --> 03:35.793
Luther Driggers.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.234
He's a genius.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.471
Developed the "No-Bug" strip.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.473
The company he worked for
took the credit and the money.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.871
Now he just wanders around town
with a bottle of poison in his pocket.

03:46.120 --> 03:46.996
Of course.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.915
Says someday he's going to put it
in the water supply, do us all in.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.832
Why do you want him on the jury?

03:53.080 --> 03:56.117
We're the defense team.
We need all the nuts we can get.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.759
What about Largent?

03:58.080 --> 04:00.150
Finley's up for reelection.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.794
If he strikes Luther...

04:02.040 --> 04:03.678
...he might upset him enough to...

04:04.520 --> 04:05.475
...you know...

04:07.560 --> 04:09.471
I'll be back in on Sunday.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.471
You've got a murder trial
starting in 3 days. Where you going?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.755
Home opener against 'Bama.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.113
Go, Dogs!

04:23.960 --> 04:24.915
Is he really leaving?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.878
Oh, yeah.
Better say a prayer.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.354
All right, Mr. Largent...

04:30.600 --> 04:34.036
...the state has the burden of proof,
and you have the opening.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.189
Your Honor.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.313
Good morning, Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.590
The state of Georgia is ready
and most anxious to proceed.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.798
If the court pleases.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.995
The philosopher Thomas Hobbes
is quoted as saying...

05:15.240 --> 05:16.639
...that life is...

05:16.880 --> 05:18.711
...nasty, brutish...

05:19.320 --> 05:20.514
...and short.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.437
And surely it must have seemed so
to Billy Hanson...

05:26.200 --> 05:27.952
...as he lay wounded...

05:28.320 --> 05:30.629
...his blood and his life...

05:30.880 --> 05:34.077
...oozing out
onto Jim Williams' Persian rug.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.039
It's important for you to know
that the defendant...

05:41.360 --> 05:43.112
By the end of this trial...

05:43.640 --> 05:44.629
...I believe...

05:45.360 --> 05:48.079
...that when faced with the evidence...

05:48.600 --> 05:49.794
...you will render...

05:50.040 --> 05:52.873
...the verdict that is fair and just:

05:55.480 --> 05:57.675
Guilty of first-degree murder.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.995
Thank you.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.398
All right, Mr. Seiler,
we've been going for some time now.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.155
Would you prefer to make
your opening statement after recess?

06:24.240 --> 06:27.471
I would prefer to address
the jury now, Your Honor.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.436
What I have to say won't take long.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.236
I apologize if I look tired...

06:39.520 --> 06:41.317
...if my eyes are red...

06:42.040 --> 06:44.110
...if my complexion is sallow.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.950
But I came by it honestly.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.268
Because...

06:49.520 --> 06:51.715
...I have not had much sleep lately.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.515
For while my bed is soft...

06:55.360 --> 06:57.555
...my client's is not.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.436
And while I'm surrounded
by my loving family...

07:02.400 --> 07:03.913
...Jim Williams...

07:04.680 --> 07:05.999
...my friend...

07:06.600 --> 07:07.828
...my client...

07:09.120 --> 07:10.633
...is locked up in a room...

07:10.880 --> 07:14.156
...full of thieves,
murderers and rapists.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.913
You're the ones I want.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.791
You're the ones I trust.

07:23.160 --> 07:27.312
Because although it is Jim Williams
on trial here today...

07:27.760 --> 07:30.274
...when I look at the circumstances...

07:30.600 --> 07:32.272
...I think to myself...

07:32.640 --> 07:33.595
...there...

07:33.840 --> 07:36.638
...but for the grace of God,
go you...

07:37.000 --> 07:37.955
...or I.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.393
You know why?
Because I guaran-damn-tee you:

07:41.640 --> 07:44.598
Someone comes into my home
and shoot at me, I will shoot back.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.035
And I'll shoot back again and again...

07:47.280 --> 07:49.794
...and again,
until I'm sure that they're dead.

07:50.040 --> 07:54.272
Until I'm sure that my home
and my family are safe.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.909
And then...

08:00.680 --> 08:02.591
...old Finley here, my friend...

08:03.240 --> 08:05.151
...would be prosecuting me.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.317
I'd be the one on trial.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.279
And my life...

08:09.520 --> 08:10.919
...would be in the hands...

08:11.560 --> 08:13.835
...of good folks like you.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.996
He is way out-of-bounds.

08:16.520 --> 08:20.354
He didn't object once during ours.
We'll look like assholes.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.511
Folks not swayed by fancy words.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.509
Folks who would not be prejudiced...

08:26.600 --> 08:28.875
...who would not judge a man...

08:29.120 --> 08:31.031
...by the color of his skin...

08:31.640 --> 08:33.789
...or the amount of money that he makes.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.308
I will say...

08:35.919 --> 08:37.910
...the simple fact of the matter...

08:38.159 --> 08:39.275
...is...

08:40.080 --> 08:41.751
...Jim Williams...

08:42.679 --> 08:44.671
...murdered no one.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.394
How did you think it went?
Because I was very pleased.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.598
Sonny has a certain style,
a flair, doesn't he?

08:54.840 --> 08:55.989
From what I've seen...

08:56.240 --> 08:59.118
...that man could weave horseshit
into Egyptian cotton.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.476
Pleasantly surprised.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.715
John Kelso,
I hope you understand.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.951
Might I consider you my friend?

09:08.520 --> 09:09.555
Yes.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.274
The lack of gunshot residue in the hand,
plus the other things I mentioned...

09:17.520 --> 09:20.273
...led me to the conclusion
that the scene was contrived.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.318
Thank you, Detective Boone.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.039
No further questions.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.039
Detective...

09:31.440 --> 09:34.637
...I'd like to revisit
some of the things...

09:35.240 --> 09:37.754
...you said just then in direct.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.754
You testified there was blood
on Hanson's hand, correct?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.310
Yes. There was blood in the palm
of the victim's hand.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.076
And that's important because if Hanson
had been holding the gun...

09:52.320 --> 09:53.639
...there'd be no blood.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.196
But you never saw the blood
on the victim's hand, did you?

09:59.560 --> 10:00.515
No.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.909
The blood was noted
in the autopsy report.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.515
I didn't turn them over
when I bagged them.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.555
I believe you also testified that...

10:09.800 --> 10:14.476
...you believe the final shot was fired
from above the victim, is that correct?

10:15.240 --> 10:19.233
I concluded that the shot came
from someone standing over the victim...

10:19.560 --> 10:20.879
...execution style.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.873
A <i>coup de grâce.</i>

10:25.480 --> 10:26.913
A <i>coup de grâce</i> ?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.555
Will you tell the jury, please...

10:37.520 --> 10:41.354
...did you find Jim's prints
on Billy's gun?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.151
The Luger handle has a textured surface.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.796
Is the answer no, Detective?

10:52.760 --> 10:55.320
Yes, the answer was no.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.437
Yes, the answer is no.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.831
State's 22, Your Honor.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.751
Who's this handsome fellow?

11:07.040 --> 11:07.995
That's me.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.473
Who's this?

11:13.920 --> 11:16.480
That's that reporter fella
from up north.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.950
The one that's working with Williams.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.278
I don't know how he got in.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.073
And this?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.233
Young officer...

11:25.480 --> 11:26.879
...name escapes me.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.671
Understandable. You'd need a program
to keep track of everyone in that room.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.114
Objection!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.157
Counsel's testifying.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.879
Strike that.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.114
I would much rather have
the detective tell us.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.795
How many people was in that room?

11:44.160 --> 11:45.354
Seven.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.229
No, eight.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.552
"Seven, no, eight."
And a pussycat.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.512
Read the funny papers, Detective?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.479
Not often.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.038
In the funny papers they sometimes
have this little competition...

12:01.280 --> 12:03.475
...to find an animal
hidden in an illustration.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.439
I love to play it with my grandson.
You know that game?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.515
We're going to play "Where's Shelton?"

12:10.760 --> 12:15.470
I don't know what Mr. Seiler's trying
to prove with all this, but I assume...

12:16.040 --> 12:19.271
Mr. Finley, we can all play.
Shelton Williams...

12:19.520 --> 12:21.556
...is the defendant's tabby cat.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.478
Now, Detective...

12:25.440 --> 12:27.237
...let's play "Where's Shelton?"

12:30.040 --> 12:31.439
I'll give you a clue.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.832
Take a look at the rug.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.790
Is the answer "yes"?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.756
State's 22, Your Honor.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.589
Tabby cat.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.595
Is Shelton Williams on your payroll?

12:55.360 --> 12:57.590
I've heard tell of cat burglars.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.239
Is this a cat detective?

13:00.960 --> 13:02.632
Don't be ridiculous.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.677
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.878
You saying that
the scene of the crime was secured.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.713
That's what's ridiculous.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.157
Seven, no, eight people, and a pussycat,
walking all around that room...

13:17.280 --> 13:18.998
You call that secure?

13:28.360 --> 13:30.032
We hung around a lot.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.677
Billy had a car
and he'd give me rides sometimes.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.512
Mr. Tucker, do you,
of your own knowledge...

13:38.760 --> 13:42.673
...know anything of the relationship
between Billy Hanson and...

13:42.920 --> 13:44.114
...Jim Williams?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.475
Objection.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.994
Objection, Your Honor.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.955
Let me see you gentlemen
over here a minute.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.559
What's this about?

14:01.400 --> 14:05.075
Your Honor, if this boy says
what I think he's going to say...

14:05.320 --> 14:07.072
...you can't ask the jury to ignore it.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.915
You can't let a skunk go in the box
and then say they didn't smell it.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.358
Our intention with Mr. Tucker is to show
the victim was afraid of the defendant.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.229
To do that, he has to describe
the nature of the relationship.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.995
Your intention
is to paint Jim Williams pink...

14:23.240 --> 14:25.629
...then rely on some prejudice
in the jury.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.792
Besides which, whatever he says
will be secondhand.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.473
It would be hearsay.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.392
He asked the witness
if he knew of his own knowledge.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.995
If he knows, it's not hearsay.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.875
I'll allow it...

14:39.240 --> 14:42.038
...but I'll grant you the same latitude
when it's your turn.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.793
Objection's overruled.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.439
Mr. Tucker, the question was,
"Do you, of your own knowledge...

14:55.680 --> 14:59.992
...know anything of the relationship
between Hanson and the defendant?"

15:00.640 --> 15:01.675
Yes, sir.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.154
Jim would give Billy money
when he needed it.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.313
He bought him a car and clothes
for going to bed with him.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.229
To sleep with him?
To...

15:13.960 --> 15:15.359
...have sex with him?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.075
Yes, sir.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.231
Now, did Billy and Jim Williams...

15:23.480 --> 15:24.754
...have any disagreements...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.115
...if you know?

15:27.320 --> 15:28.673
All the time.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.640
Jim would be pissed off at Billy...

15:31.880 --> 15:33.677
...for one thing or another.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.032
He was real jealous of Billy.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.759
And what feelings, if any...

15:41.000 --> 15:43.958
...did Billy have about the defendant?

15:45.400 --> 15:48.039
Jim is a rich and powerful man.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.155
Billy was a little afraid of him,
I guess.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.589
Thank you.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.439
Minerva.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.629
Tell me...

16:20.440 --> 16:22.954
...how well did you know Billy Hanson?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.752
What kind of friends were you?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.079
Yes, sir.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.311
He was my best friend in the world.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.951
We saw each other all the time.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.153
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.675
And nothing you wouldn't do for him.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.954
If you're trying to say I'm lying,
I'm not.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.591
Take it easy, young man.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.558
Everything I say is true.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.270
Of course. There's no reason for it
not to be. That's all we're after here.

16:52.160 --> 16:56.472
How well did you know Jim Williams?
You never did meet him, did you?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.231
Not shaking hands or nothing.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.034
But I stood next to him in the emergency
room when Billy O.D.'d.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.627
Billy Hanson...

17:05.880 --> 17:07.518
...overdosed on drugs?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.194
When?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.511
About a month before Jim killed him.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.313
So Jim Williams...

17:20.560 --> 17:23.632
...took Billy Hanson to the hospital.
He saved his life.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.393
If he wanted him dead...

17:25.640 --> 17:27.358
...why would he do that?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.353
I don't know.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.313
I guess...

17:33.120 --> 17:34.314
Did you...

17:34.880 --> 17:36.632
...ever have sex with Billy?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.271
No. No, sir.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.071
Are you yourself a homosexual?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.915
Objection.

17:51.000 --> 17:51.955
Relevance?

17:52.840 --> 17:54.831
Mr. Largent, you opened that door.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.356
What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.669
I'll let it in.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.959
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.711
Want me to repeat the question, George?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.872
I could have the court reporter
read it out.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.951
No, sir. I ain't no fairy.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.039
I've had some experiences, but...

18:22.920 --> 18:24.478
...I'm out of it now.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.669
Out of it?

18:26.920 --> 18:28.035
Yes, sir.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.271
Would you care to explain to the jury
what you mean by that?

18:33.560 --> 18:34.629
It's wrong.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.194
The Bible says so.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.316
Bible also says
it's wrong to lie.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.318
How long have you been out of it?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.472
Almost 3 weeks.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.752
Congratulations, George.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.509
Good for you.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.591
No further questions, Your Honor.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.874
- Please.
- Chablis, it's a subpoena!

19:17.120 --> 19:18.633
They'll hold you in contempt.

19:18.880 --> 19:23.351
I don't care if it's an invitation
from God. They fuck with the Doll...

19:23.600 --> 19:25.397
- You got that off TV.
- Whatever.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.153
They'll hold you in contempt.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.755
I've been held in contempt before.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.319
A man's life is at stake.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.314
What do I have to do
with that man's life? Nothing.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.709
Absolutely nothing.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.713
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.552
What kind of deal?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.708
What kind of deal?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.596
Wait, John, be patient.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.673
I'll tell you what.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.629
You bring me a truckload of
good-looking boys to my show tonight...

19:54.880 --> 19:56.313
...and I'll think about it.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.438
I'd love to, but I can't.
I got to go to some cotillion.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.952
How boring.
What cotillion are you going to?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.394
The Alpha Phi.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.638
The black people's ball?

20:06.880 --> 20:09.235
You're going to the black people's ball?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.749
- Absolutely not.
- Please? Take me.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.513
I'll be on my best behavior.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.832
I promise, John.
Please take me.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.513
- I can't.
- I won't shake my ass or cuss.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.079
I won't do anything.
Please.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.673
These girls are debutantes.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.833
What does that mean? I can't clientele
with uptown black-ass people?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.992
No, but, you know,
debs are carefully scrutinized.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.397
Please. And?

20:36.720 --> 20:38.278
For the most part...

20:39.600 --> 20:41.556
...not many of them hide their candy...

20:41.960 --> 20:44.110
...and few have been caught shoplifting.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.673
You know, not many.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.719
These bitches must do it damn good,
if they haven't gotten caught yet.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.520
I imagine they do
a lot of volunteer work, Frank.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.752
Stay out of bars, go to churches.
Those kind of ladies.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.913
First of all,
don't you ever call me Frank again.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.272
And are these black girls
we're talking about?

21:05.520 --> 21:09.513
If these are black girls,
they must be some ugly bitches, honey.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.029
Take me.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.713
- Please?
- Come on.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.790
Take me.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.837
- Cut it out.
- Please take me.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.350
It's good to have you here.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.477
You know, this is our 40th year.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.709
It's lovely.

21:58.440 --> 22:02.353
I do believe
we've almost caught the white cotillion.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.999
Congratulations.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.435
Good evening.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.197
Sir, is this spot taken?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.908
- No, ma'am.
- Please don't call me ma'am.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.832
My name's Chablis.
What's yours?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.672
Phillip. I'm an escort.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.715
An escort.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.110
Do you work for a service?

23:06.360 --> 23:07.713
No, I'm escorting my sister.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.871
Don't tell me you're doing it with her.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.995
My sister's boyfriend decided
not to come, so I got roped into it.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.874
Let me ask you something.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.518
You ever been arrested?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.235
Oh, come on.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.708
Once, sort of.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.191
I had a few drinks.
I got a ticket for disturbing the peace.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.030
Disturbing the peace.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.115
I got a piece you can disturb, hon.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.996
I've been admiring your gown.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.714
Thank you very much.
This old thing?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.757
It's very glamorous.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.718
Thank you very much.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.552
Of whom are you a guest?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.399
I'm here with my cousin.

23:53.920 --> 23:54.830
My cousin...

23:55.920 --> 23:57.194
...LaVella.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.795
LaVella.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.157
She's a lovely girl.

24:01.400 --> 24:05.029
Oh, I think so too.
She's always wanted this...

24:05.280 --> 24:08.750
...since we were kids.
She never thought she'd get it.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.798
She had nothing to worry about.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.073
You know what, hon?
I told her the same thing.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.471
If Vanessa Williams can pull one off
on the Miss America committee...

24:18.720 --> 24:21.792
...then her little whoring around
in Atlanta, Georgia...

24:22.040 --> 24:26.750
...was not going to mean anything to
a little steering committee in Savannah.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.111
And she got it.
I'm so happy for her.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.393
Would you watch my purse?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.156
Phillip and I are going to go
disturb the peace.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.674
What do you think?

24:37.920 --> 24:40.309
Let's go disturb some peace.
Come on.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.668
Oh, Jesus!

25:45.760 --> 25:47.637
Would you excuse me for one moment?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.880
You have a lot of nerve busting in
on me like this.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.315
I got plenty of nerve
to do anything I want to do.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.790
- How far are you going to take this?
- I'm just starting.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.439
Then I'm going to leave.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.877
I don't intend on insulting these people
any more than I have to.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.998
Behave yourself.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.873
Come on. Let's go.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.195
Stop pushing me. I'm going.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.715
Bartender, could I please have
two apple schnapps?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.791
I think you better make those doubles.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.868
So, John, tell me,
you mad at me, honey?

27:05.120 --> 27:06.394
Are you mad?

27:06.760 --> 27:07.636
Are you?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.394
- We're still friends.
- I hope so. I must tell you something.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.154
You are so sexy when you're mad.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.595
- Behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.196
I want to propose a toast.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.750
From my top...

27:21.000 --> 27:22.638
...to your bottom...

27:22.880 --> 27:25.519
...from your bottom to my top...

27:25.880 --> 27:28.553
...from my middle to your middle...

27:29.400 --> 27:31.755
...be good, John,
I just might give you a little.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.958
- Just behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.556
Besides,
your star witness is testifying.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.150
Since when?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.992
Since I thought about it.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.959
And I realized how nice
you've been to me.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.235
You know what?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.755
You've treated me like a perfect lady.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.560
You've even made me feel
so very special.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.877
You know,
people can be so mean sometimes.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.633
But not you.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.558
I want to ask you something.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.276
John, do you think I'm beautiful?

28:06.840 --> 28:09.035
Yes, I think you're very pretty.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.114
Pretty? I'm just not your type?

28:13.560 --> 28:15.232
Are you testifying for me?

28:15.480 --> 28:18.358
Of course I am. You think I give a shit
about Miss Jim Williams?

28:18.600 --> 28:21.319
I don't even know that bitch.
Never even met her.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.675
Listen...

28:22.920 --> 28:27.277
...on cross-examination they'll be
pretty rough on you and your background.

28:27.520 --> 28:32.071
I have nothing to hide and I'm
not ashamed of anything I've ever done.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.677
You should know that you taking the
stand is a blanket indictment of Hanson.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.036
Let me get this right, now.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.512
You're saying because Billy hung out
with drag queens, he deserved to die?

28:43.760 --> 28:45.716
- It's fucked up, but, yeah.
- That's fucked up.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.751
Maybe you shouldn't testify.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.473
John, how sweet. You really care.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.039
Good. Because, guess what?
I'm testifying.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.793
I am testifying.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.998
You see, those folks think
they're using the Doll...

29:02.240 --> 29:04.151
...but the Doll's using them right back.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.110
I'm going to use that courtroom
as my coming-out party.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.793
You see, you know who I am.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.270
I'm the Lady Chablis.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.839
Hear me roar.

29:15.080 --> 29:15.990
Look out!

29:17.600 --> 29:19.875
Besides,
I've already bought a new ensemble.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.554
- Really? Is it nice?
- You'll see, hon.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.314
Listen to me.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.232
We must get out of here.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.438
It's rude of you to bust in on me.
I'd never do that to you.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.955
LaVella's mother
is about to have a seizure.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.919
Somebody put a spoon in her mouth, then,
because I'm not leaving.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.309
You're leaving now.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.232
- I am not.
- I'll buy you a drink.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.629
- Buy me a drink.
- Outside of here.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.552
- Buy me a diamond.
- I'll buy you a diamond.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.711
- Give me some.
- I'm not giving you shit.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.473
Oh, come on!

29:45.720 --> 29:47.153
You know I'm straight.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.469
So am I.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.711
Straight to my house. Let's go.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.155
Raise your right hand.

29:58.400 --> 30:02.791
Do you swear the evidence you're about
to give is the truth, so help you God?

30:03.040 --> 30:03.916
I do.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.598
Now, Miss De Veau...

30:08.120 --> 30:11.749
...I'll ask you a question and
I want you to answer to the jury...

30:12.000 --> 30:15.072
...so that they can understand.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.712
Yes, and what is that?
You'd like me to explain my "T"?

30:20.280 --> 30:21.998
Your "T"?

30:23.960 --> 30:25.279
My "T."

30:25.520 --> 30:27.351
Yeah, explain your "T"...

30:27.600 --> 30:31.639
...in as plain a language
as you possibly can for our friends.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.997
I will try my best to explain
to you jurors.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.357
I could throw words and labels
at all of you...

30:38.600 --> 30:40.272
...but you seem like nice people.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.030
So I'm going to be open and honest.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.118
I have a man's toolbox...

30:47.880 --> 30:49.996
...but everything else about me
is pure lady.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.999
I love to dress in women's clothes.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.916
I love to go shopping.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.071
I love to have my nails done...

30:58.320 --> 31:00.754
...and I love men.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.752
Any questions?

31:08.160 --> 31:10.674
And, ma'am,
I hope you don't mind my saying...

31:10.960 --> 31:13.952
...blue is definitely not your color.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.992
Okay, gals, you're both pretty, now.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.030
What I want to know
and want you to tell the jury is...

31:20.280 --> 31:22.794
...how you and Billy Hanson first met.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.791
Billy hit on me one night at the...
Strike that, Your Honor.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.548
Billy and I clienteled.

31:28.920 --> 31:29.909
"Clienteled."

31:30.160 --> 31:31.957
Will you explain what that means?

31:32.200 --> 31:36.716
We socialized together for a little
while, until he met my roommate Corinne.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.190
Corinne.
Now, you telling me that...

31:39.440 --> 31:42.955
...Corinne and Billy Hanson
were intimate?

31:44.360 --> 31:46.430
Hot and intimate.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.551
Will you tell the jury...

31:51.000 --> 31:52.752
...did Billy Hanson use drugs?

31:56.480 --> 32:00.189
Yes. Billy did pills, smoked pot...

32:00.440 --> 32:01.714
...little coke.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.190
He sold drugs.

32:04.640 --> 32:09.156
He'd stay with us sometimes, so
sometimes we had stash around the house.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.510
- Mrs. Chablis...
- Miss.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.911
Course, Miss Chablis.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.912
Do you yourself take drugs?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.711
I smoke a little pot.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.871
I'm a mellow kind of girl.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.709
I understand.

32:27.080 --> 32:31.073
Well, tell me
if you know what effect, if any...

32:31.320 --> 32:33.709
...these drugs
had on the relationship...

32:33.960 --> 32:36.315
...between your friend Corinne
and Billy.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.792
Well, now, when Billy got high,
he could be very, very hostile.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.919
Hostile, when he was high.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.958
Would you explain to the jury
what you mean by hostile?

32:46.200 --> 32:49.431
I can do more than that, hon.
Let me show you something.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.716
Look at my driver's license.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.235
- Just a minute.
- Objection.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.515
This isn't proper.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.829
Be quiet.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.115
I'll handle this.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.236
Just a minute.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.152
That's not proper procedure.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.558
Pick up this item, please.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.479
My eye. He hit me. I looked like
that dog from <i>The Little Rascals.</i>

33:09.720 --> 33:13.395
Members of the jury, I'm instructing you
to disregard this outburst.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.710
Pay no attention to that picture.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.275
Your Honor? It's the truth.
I'm not lying.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.431
Your Honor, the people...

33:21.760 --> 33:22.795
Be quiet.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.793
Now we got to get this thing
under control.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.598
You sit down, Mr. De Veau.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.990
Miss De Veau. I'm a single girl.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.032
Miss De Veau, whatever.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.235
Have a seat.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.594
Okay, but please don't get too huffy.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.592
You listen to me.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.234
I'm in charge of this courtroom,
not you.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.799
Here's the way it works:

33:44.040 --> 33:46.918
These lawyers
are going to ask you questions...

33:47.160 --> 33:48.559
...and you answer them.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.911
If I tell you to stop, you stop.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.831
If I tell you to sit, you sit.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.436
And I don't want you to communicate
directly with that jury.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.079
Don't produce any more items.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.717
Don't show any photographs.
Do you understand that?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.475
Yes, Your Honor.
I understand.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.434
Mrs. Wright threw in some gumbo.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.879
I got you cigarettes.

34:17.239 --> 34:21.358
Thank you. How are we coming
with our character witnesses?

34:21.600 --> 34:26.275
I thought we would limit it to 3 because
we don't need too much fawning and...

34:26.920 --> 34:28.114
Why not?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.793
Tell him how many friends
are lining up to defend me.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.112
I suggest Wanda Javitz.
She has a commanding vocal presence.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.510
She declined, Jim...

34:36.760 --> 34:38.034
...along with some others.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.549
Declined?

34:45.840 --> 34:47.751
They clamored for my friendship.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.197
Hoping and praying
for invitations to my parties.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.071
Where were their judgments then?

34:55.719 --> 34:59.315
I hope Wanda knows this puts her
in the out box for my Christmas party.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.712
I don't think we have to worry
about character witnesses.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.234
They got theirs, we got ours.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.633
When do I take the stand?

35:08.320 --> 35:09.275
Last.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.669
Good.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.310
They'll have heard all the theories.
We'll finish with the truth.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.709
I look forward to this.

35:15.960 --> 35:20.397
It's important, not that I'm acquitted,
but that everyone knows I'm innocent.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.793
I refuse to live in a world
where whispers become fact.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.918
Guilty men murmur.
The innocent shout to the rafters.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.434
Hear, hear.

35:30.480 --> 35:34.951
We may need you to come clean
about the relationship with Billy.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.273
Your sexuality, Jim.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.350
Finley's taken this thing in a direction
we didn't count on.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.795
His own private witch-hunt.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.677
It's going to destroy Mother.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.959
Jim, she was in court.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.553
She heard George Tucker.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.076
Face it, she already knows.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.751
Not from me she doesn't.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.511
What if she wasn't in court?

36:18.200 --> 36:20.191
What's the matter?
Gunpowder?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.996
Damn gunshot residue test.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.630
Your expert witness covered it.
He said the tests are unreliable.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.677
Jury thinks that's a cop-out.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.435
Every one of them knows Doc Poe.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.432
Why listen to some egghead
from up north? No offense.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.795
No, none taken.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.235
He said gunpowder wipes off.
Maybe when they handled the body...

36:43.480 --> 36:45.436
Boone says he bagged them.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.875
Doc Poe says they were bagged
when he performed the autopsy.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.715
When are they going to get wiped off?

36:54.120 --> 36:55.314
I don't know.

36:59.320 --> 37:03.074
Do you remember when you told me
that dead men tell no tales?

37:04.760 --> 37:05.875
See, I think...

37:06.120 --> 37:09.874
...that may be true,
but it does not apply here.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.118
I mean, look around.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.637
Every picture on every wall in this town
is of someone who's gone.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.031
Every story you hear begins
with someone who's dead.

37:20.920 --> 37:25.232
The only living national treasure
you have is your own slavering mutt.

37:25.960 --> 37:30.033
You writing your book?
What the hell are you talking about?

37:30.280 --> 37:33.033
Billy Hanson may not be talking,
but his hands are.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.397
Billy Hanson's hands?

37:38.520 --> 37:39.794
I got to go.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.354
Where you going?

37:46.640 --> 37:48.471
"To understand the living...

37:48.920 --> 37:51.354
...you got to commune with the dead.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.234
I need Shango.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.109
Now go.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.510
And don't you dare look back."

38:01.000 --> 38:03.878
I hope you can communicate
with someone.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.711
Feel like going for a walk?

38:13.520 --> 38:14.873
Where you headed?

38:15.880 --> 38:19.111
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe stopping by the morgue.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.638
Are you a necrophiliac or something?

38:21.880 --> 38:23.996
We agreed you wouldn't talk
about my ex-wife.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.113
- How long you been at the bar?
- Long enough. It'll be fun.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.759
Why do you want to go?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.833
If I could answer that question,
I wouldn't have to go.

38:32.080 --> 38:35.914
The morgue's closed, and by tomorrow
this won't seem like such a good idea.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.870
Precisely. I'll break in if I have to.
I don't care. I'll pretend I'm dead.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.154
- You sure you want to do this?
- I think so.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.389
There is a back way...

38:47.640 --> 38:50.359
...a hallway off the emergency room.
It's off-limits.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.875
- How do you know that?
- I candy-striped one summer.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.519
At the morgue?

38:54.880 --> 38:57.075
- We'll create a distraction...
- We?

38:57.320 --> 39:01.279
You create the distraction
and I'll just slip in and check it out.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.592
No, you'll get lost.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.760
All right, it's a 3-man job.
Where's Joe?

39:08.000 --> 39:11.117
Perfect casting, but he's out of town
till tomorrow.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.910
Who do we know
who can cause a commotion?

39:22.520 --> 39:23.794
Hello! Nurse!

39:27.880 --> 39:29.359
- What's wrong with her?
- Her stomach.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.192
Appendicitis.
My water broke.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.398
Get the doctor to exam 4.
Water broke? She's pregnant.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.631
I don't know what's up. Just help.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.996
- What's wrong?
- A stomach problem.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.912
Let's get her up on the table.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.994
Okay, here we are.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.798
Commune away.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.234
Is this where it hurts?

39:52.480 --> 39:53.959
Just...
Oh, doctor, wait.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.636
Here?

39:55.880 --> 39:58.599
You know, I think you need to go
just a little bit lower.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.509
Never been in a morgue.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.193
What are we looking for?

40:04.200 --> 40:07.556
I don't know. Something about
the bagging of the hands.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.110
Oh, look. Teddy Lipscomb.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.035
Excuse me?

40:12.560 --> 40:15.677
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was my dad's dentist.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.038
Oh, man!

40:19.680 --> 40:20.556
Cardiac arrest.

40:20.800 --> 40:25.191
Right. Medical term for dying in the
arms of a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.190
Poor guy.

40:28.280 --> 40:31.511
See, now, remind me
never to get sick in Savannah.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.671
He's wearing a hospital I.D. Bracelet.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.718
You're supposed to get well
in hospitals, but not in this city.

40:37.040 --> 40:41.318
The morgue doesn't have its own ramp,
so all DOA's come through emergency.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.790
Technically, they'd have to be admitted.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.719
They're all wearing bracelets.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.918
It's bureaucratic red tape.
I told you, I candy-striped.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.071
You did.
That's like volunteer work?

40:53.320 --> 40:55.595
Yeah, cute little striped outfit,
short skirt.

40:55.840 --> 40:56.909
Girl Scouts.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.312
- Is this where it hurts?
- Almost.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.676
Just a tad bit...

41:01.920 --> 41:04.480
That's the spot.
I love you.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.957
I love you.
Oh, Dr. Feelgood, that's the spot.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.394
You got it.

41:14.720 --> 41:18.759
You wouldn't take a bag off
to put an I.D. Bracelet on, would you?

41:19.600 --> 41:20.919
Yeah, probably.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.115
Maybe.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.313
Pleasure's been all mine, Doctor.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.835
How you doing, Mom?

41:31.080 --> 41:33.355
Nurse, I have a question for you.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.353
Were you on duty the night
Billy Hanson's body came in?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.272
I was.
How'd you get back there?

41:38.520 --> 41:41.080
Back door.
I was here with the sick lady?

41:41.320 --> 41:44.232
I have a question.
Hanson's hands were bagged.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.118
Someone had to put the I.D. Bracelet on.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.158
Would you take the bag off
to slide the bracelet on?

41:49.400 --> 41:51.231
No, they snap on.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.519
They snap on?

41:55.320 --> 41:56.230
Thank you.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.233
It was easier with him
because I bagged him after.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.395
Excuse me?

42:03.960 --> 42:08.431
Doc Poe called from the crime scene and
said to bag the hands when he came in.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.833
You bagged the hands?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.794
Yes, I wrote it up
on the admission sheet.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.189
May I see that?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.150
We'll let Sonny tell you.
He'll be here any minute.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.915
Before Sonny gets here,
I'd like to run something by you.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.310
- Fire away.
- About that night.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.153
What do you got?

42:37.920 --> 42:40.480
The evening started out
as I've always said.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.669
<i>The argument...</i>

42:43.080 --> 42:44.195
<i>... the shouting...</i>

42:47.800 --> 42:49.791
You let me down, like everyone else.

42:50.640 --> 42:54.235
My mama let me down. She hates me
because I look like my daddy.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.914
- What are you yelling about?
- I'm yelling about you!

42:57.160 --> 43:01.278
It's fine for you to talk to me
about living in this grandeur and all.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.511
You could do it
if you took responsibility.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.273
Bullshit, Jim!

43:05.520 --> 43:08.557
If you don't like it,
why don't you just get the hell out?!

43:08.840 --> 43:10.193
Get the hell out.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.159
This candle is about ready
to go through that painting!

43:13.400 --> 43:17.188
I'll stop paying the insurance
on your Camaro.

43:17.440 --> 43:21.115
You want to leave,
you can do it tomorrow morning.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.393
<i>The damaged clock...</i>

43:36.440 --> 43:37.589
Goddamn it.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.991
Walk into my house
and ruin my furniture. I've had it.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.834
You're going to jail, young man.
That's it.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.992
<i>Billy pointing the Luger...</i>

43:47.240 --> 43:48.719
I may be leaving tomorrow...

43:49.600 --> 43:50.715
...but goddamn it...

43:51.080 --> 43:53.878
<i>But here's the difference:</i>
<i>When he pulled the trigger...</i>

43:54.120 --> 43:54.996
...you're leaving tonight.

43:55.960 --> 43:56.995
<i>... nothing happened.</i>

43:57.240 --> 43:59.356
<i>The gun was on safety.</i>

43:59.600 --> 44:02.751
<i>As he fumbled to take the safety off,</i>
<i>I grabbed my own gun...</i>

44:08.560 --> 44:09.788
<i>... and I shot him.</i>

44:25.720 --> 44:26.994
He fell dead.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.111
He never fired?

44:35.760 --> 44:36.715
No.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.348
<i>I thought, "What have you done?!"</i>

45:10.200 --> 45:11.838
It explains...

45:12.080 --> 45:15.117
...why there's no powder
on Billy's hands.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.796
When I sit on that stand
and I tell this to the jury...

45:19.040 --> 45:20.519
...Largent's case...

45:20.760 --> 45:22.478
...will crumble.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.477
I don't see how you figure that.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.152
If you tell that story...

45:35.680 --> 45:36.999
...you're admitting...

45:37.240 --> 45:38.468
...that you lied.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.949
Lied to everyone.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.519
The police...

45:43.880 --> 45:45.233
...the press...

45:46.920 --> 45:48.194
...everyone.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.229
Yes.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.233
Of course.

45:57.400 --> 46:01.791
I'd rather be convicted of lying
than of murder.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.755
So...

46:05.760 --> 46:06.829
Hey, coach.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.229
We got it.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.669
Keep your seat.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.391
Sonny, I need to tell you something.

46:13.880 --> 46:17.156
Now, me first.
You know that gunshot residue test?

46:17.400 --> 46:20.153
What I have to say has direct bearing
on the gunshot residue...

46:20.400 --> 46:21.674
Can I get this out?

46:25.320 --> 46:27.038
We got them by the gonads.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.157
Detective Boone lied.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.557
Doc Poe called the admitting nurse
and told her to bag the hands...

46:34.800 --> 46:36.552
...if they were not already.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.358
Which she did.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.039
Right here in this document.

46:45.720 --> 46:50.077
Many could have handled the body
between the crime scene and the hospital.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.109
Which explains how the powder
got rubbed off.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.989
There it is.

46:55.880 --> 47:00.556
The death knell to Finley Largent's
precious gunshot residue test.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.075
Your turn.

47:05.960 --> 47:06.995
What was it?

47:11.240 --> 47:12.832
Oh, it's not important.

47:19.640 --> 47:20.914
Take a look here.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.871
We got them, Jimbo.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.912
Going somewhere, coach?

47:42.240 --> 47:43.719
What's his story?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.797
You're still under oath.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.430
Frank...

48:08.600 --> 48:10.875
...are you absolutely sure...

48:11.120 --> 48:14.430
...that you bagged Billy Hanson's hands
at Mercer House?

48:14.680 --> 48:15.795
Yes.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.430
I have no further questions.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.911
Redirect, Mr. Largent?

48:28.240 --> 48:29.275
No, Your Honor.

48:30.080 --> 48:34.631
Detective, you're excused. You're still
under subpoena. Thank you very much.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.680
Defense calls Sara Warren...

48:37.920 --> 48:39.035
...R.N.

48:44.120 --> 48:45.872
You won't find her in your notes.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.951
She's not on your list, Finley.

48:48.200 --> 48:52.318
Sara Warren is a direct rebuttal
to the testimony of Detective Boone.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.435
She is, in fact, an admitting nurse...

48:55.680 --> 48:57.272
...at Chandler Emergency Room.

49:17.840 --> 49:22.311
<i>Mr. Williams, will you describe</i>
<i>your relationship with the deceased?</i>

49:24.560 --> 49:28.712
I met Billy Hanson when he came around
to the house wanting a job.

49:29.640 --> 49:30.550
So...

49:30.800 --> 49:33.268
...I hired him in the workshop
to refinish furniture.

49:33.520 --> 49:36.034
He had some talent,
and I wanted to encourage him.

49:36.560 --> 49:37.834
During this time...

49:38.080 --> 49:41.868
...I developed hypoglycemia. I
blacked-out at times. I don't eat well.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.792
The doctor told me...

49:44.040 --> 49:47.430
...it was not good for me to be alone
when this condition occurs.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.477
So Billy would stay over...

49:49.720 --> 49:51.472
...and take care of me
when I wasn't well.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.917
He did not live at Mercer House,
as has been stated.

49:57.960 --> 50:02.750
Is that the full extent of your
relationship with Billy Hanson?

50:04.720 --> 50:08.998
No. Over time, it evolved
into something less formal.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.069
We became intimate.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.591
Billy could be very charming.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.195
He had his girlfriends and I had mine.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.669
But to me...

50:17.920 --> 50:20.275
...sex is a perfectly natural thing.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.556
It didn't bother me.
It didn't bother him.

50:23.120 --> 50:27.636
It was just an occasional natural
occurrence between consenting adults.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.231
Would you describe to the jury...

50:35.480 --> 50:38.233
...the events
that occurred in your house...

50:38.480 --> 50:39.754
...after the party?

50:41.960 --> 50:44.838
By the time Billy got back to the house
he was quite high...

50:45.080 --> 50:47.913
...and we got into an argument
about a planned trip to London.

50:48.320 --> 50:52.074
I was going to an auction, and Billy was
to accompany me because of my condition.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.915
But he insisted on taking
marijuana cigarettes.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.630
I do not approve of drugs
and I told him he could not go.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.758
He became verbally abusive
and I ordered Billy out of the house.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.353
He went into the hallway.

51:04.600 --> 51:08.434
The argument continued there.
Then he knocked over a clock.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.956
I went to call the police.
He followed me with a gun.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.315
<i>He said...</i>

51:15.840 --> 51:17.751
...and I'll never forget this:

51:18.000 --> 51:19.399
<i>"I might leave tomorrow...</i>

51:19.640 --> 51:22.108
...but goddamn it,
you're leaving tonight."

51:24.560 --> 51:25.629
I saw that Luger...

51:25.880 --> 51:26.676
<i>... and moved.</i>

51:26.920 --> 51:29.036
I reached in a drawer
for my own weapon.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.032
As I came up,
the first shot...

51:31.600 --> 51:33.158
<i>... I felt breeze by my shoulder.</i>

51:37.600 --> 51:38.589
And I fired.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.593
I don't remember how many times.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.759
<i>It was horrible.</i>

52:12.360 --> 52:14.237
<i>We're all Savannahians.</i>

52:14.480 --> 52:17.631
<i>Our paths cross from time to time.</i>

52:18.120 --> 52:19.553
<i>We greet each other.</i>

52:20.000 --> 52:22.070
<i>Smile here, nod there.</i>

52:23.040 --> 52:24.996
<i>But even if we don 't know each other...</i>

52:25.760 --> 52:27.512
<i>... we have one thing in common.</i>

52:28.720 --> 52:31.553
<i>This beautiful place where we all live.</i>

52:32.640 --> 52:34.312
<i>And as one Savannahian...</i>

52:34.560 --> 52:35.709
<i>... to 12...</i>

52:36.560 --> 52:39.996
<i>... I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for your civic pride...</i>

52:40.360 --> 52:41.793
<i>... for your diligence...</i>

52:42.240 --> 52:44.037
<i>... and here in this courtroom...</i>

52:44.520 --> 52:46.078
<i>... for your rapt attention.</i>

52:46.320 --> 52:48.356
I've watched you taking notes.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.478
The prosecution
started this whole thing...

52:52.720 --> 52:55.188
...quoting someone
by the name of Hobbes.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.873
I don't know who that is...

52:58.120 --> 52:58.916
...but...

52:59.200 --> 53:01.794
...I do know who Perry Mason is.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.549
You watch <i>Perry Mason</i> ?

53:04.840 --> 53:05.829
I do.

53:06.760 --> 53:08.113
And I got to thinking...

53:08.360 --> 53:10.271
...if some TV writer...

53:10.800 --> 53:12.791
...was to come to Perry Mason
and say...

53:13.040 --> 53:16.874
..."Here you are, Mr. Raymond Burr,
here's a story like this."

53:17.120 --> 53:18.792
You know what I think he'd say?

53:19.040 --> 53:20.792
I think old Raymond would say...

53:20.960 --> 53:23.428
"That's not a very good story.

53:23.680 --> 53:26.194
I wouldn't have to be
a very good lawyer...

53:26.440 --> 53:28.635
...to get that man off,
now would I?"

53:29.480 --> 53:30.629
He'd be right!

53:32.640 --> 53:33.629
Because...

53:33.920 --> 53:37.754
...by all the evidence,
Jim Williams is an innocent man.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.112
But I'm not Perry Mason.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.516
I'm not some TV lawyer.

53:45.720 --> 53:50.430
So I got to scratch and tear
at the prosecution's case...

53:51.200 --> 53:54.033
...trying to whittle it down to nothing.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.830
And darned if I don't think I have!

53:58.680 --> 54:03.310
Because the fabrication
of the prosecution's case is in pieces.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.273
When you consider
how Detective Boone...

54:06.520 --> 54:10.752
...has consistently lied
about bagging the hands.

54:14.320 --> 54:15.878
Does that surprise you...

54:16.880 --> 54:18.632
...that a detective would lie?

54:20.080 --> 54:21.718
Of course he will.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.833
He's not a bad man.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.355
But how else will he play the cards...

54:26.640 --> 54:29.279
...that have been dealt to him
from a pack of lies?

54:31.800 --> 54:33.074
If Jim Williams...

54:33.760 --> 54:35.478
...is guilty of anything...

54:36.520 --> 54:38.715
...he's guilty of bad association.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.509
But that's not why he's on trial for.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.192
If you don't like...

54:45.440 --> 54:48.910
...or if you don't cotton
to his lifestyle...

54:49.440 --> 54:51.032
...just think about this:

54:51.640 --> 54:53.631
We deal with these people all the time.

54:53.960 --> 54:54.995
Some good...

54:55.240 --> 54:56.514
...some bad.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.678
They're a part of our community.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.556
You can't judge a man for that.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.879
This is God's world.

55:06.840 --> 55:08.751
Let God be the judge of that.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.879
And let you good folks...

55:12.920 --> 55:14.512
...be the judge of this.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.394
Come on, now.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.198
You let this man go home.

55:27.400 --> 55:28.628
He's had enough.

55:35.160 --> 55:36.275
Thank you.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.310
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

56:17.080 --> 56:18.593
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

56:19.320 --> 56:20.548
Is it unanimous?

56:21.640 --> 56:22.709
Yes!

56:27.120 --> 56:28.758
Hand it to the sheriff, please.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.879
Pick that up.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.553
Hand it to me.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.318
Give it back to him.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.800
Defendant and attorneys,
rise, please.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.832
Publish the verdict.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.959
"We, the jury,
find the defendant...

57:23.320 --> 57:24.355
...not guilty."

57:33.520 --> 57:36.353
Members of the jury,
this concludes your work.

57:36.600 --> 57:40.559
You've rendered great service
to Savannah and Chatham County.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.673
I'm going to dismiss you now
with the thanks of the court.

57:57.320 --> 57:58.548
Congratulations, Jim.

57:58.800 --> 57:59.949
Thank you, John.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.279
Hey, boy!

58:37.240 --> 58:38.639
What do you got?

58:39.600 --> 58:40.999
Come on down.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.110
We gots to go visit the boy.

58:47.560 --> 58:50.120
We got to make him
quit working James.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.717
Trial's over, Minerva.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.595
Billy can't do anything to James now.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.232
Why I come to you?

58:59.040 --> 59:00.598
Because you...

59:00.840 --> 59:03.354
...out of everybody,
know it ain't over yet.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.028
I know, the boy know, and you know
justice ain't been done yet.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.718
I'll come down for a minute.

59:20.760 --> 59:22.273
I don't know about this.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.353
That's exactly why you come this far.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.673
Billy always loved Wild Turkey.

59:55.520 --> 59:57.192
He ain't happy here.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.991
Ain't what he thought it would be.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.990
If you ain't in heaven yet, you want
to get there, don't you, boy?

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.752
The only way you're going to get up...

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.468
...is if you quit playing with James.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.474
I has influence with the dead.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.551
They can lift you up.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.917
Nobody else can do that for you.
Nobody!

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.112
Don't you laugh at me!

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.075
You think you had a harsh life?

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.390
You got no idea.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.960
Never had no bills to pay...

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.317
...no children to feed,
no house to clean.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.711
You had it easy.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.395
You can just lay there.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.029
Where's Jim?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.552
Thanks for dropping by.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.595
I've finished my Christmas party list...

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.870
...and you made the cut.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.509
I'm honored,
but I won't be here.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.030
Many will be disappointed.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.594
So, obviously,
you've decided to stay in town.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.198
Living here pisses off
all the right people.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.077
- What can I do for you?
- I have something for you.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.153
Yussopov's dagger may have seemed...

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.550
...more useful,
given your profession...

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.360
...but the painting
somehow seemed appropriate.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.636
I hope you will accept it...

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.791
...as an expression of my gratitude.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.678
<i>Newmarket Heath,</i> the overpaint.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.796
Thank you.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.395
I'll have it sent along.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.189
I don't want to keep you
from your party.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.633
But one more question, for the book.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.231
Do you want to tell me
what really happened?

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.749
Sport...

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.555
...truth, like art...

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.711
...is in the eye of the beholder.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.552
You believe what you choose...

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.551
...and I'll believe what I know.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.234
Good luck, Jim.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.113
Why didn't you come in?

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.914
I never enter the office on Sunday.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.229
Bad juju.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.638
I still got a lot of questions.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.318
You know all you need to know.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.354
One thing...

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.593
...don't commune so long with the dead
you forget the living.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.514
What's this?

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.993
I love you, boy.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.957
But I ain't the only one.
You know that, don't you?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.918
How long's your lease?

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.439
Six months.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.512
Welcome to Savannah.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.116
You hungry?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.271
- Come on.
- Let's go, girl.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.270
You two know you're not going anywhere
without a chaperone.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.798
I cooked my Chablis' famous chicken.
Let's go have a picnic.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.108
And guess what?

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.113
You get your choice of breast or thigh.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.517
What's it called, the chicken?

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.036
Chablis' Kicking Chicken.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.838
Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.640
Yes, sir.
Patrick do like his morning walk.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.551
Patrick is walking kind of fancy
this morning, isn't he?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.551
