in his living room.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.251
Well.

13:48.293 --> 13:50.761
Oh, I got
a better idea.

13:53.598 --> 13:56.328
"I thought I taw
a puddy cat.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.130
I did. I did."

13:58.169 --> 13:59.693
<i>(squawks)</i>

14:01.272 --> 14:03.740
<i>(cracking)</i>

14:13.618 --> 14:16.109
I can't believe
we drove around all day

14:16.154 --> 14:18.987
and there's not
a single job in this town.

14:19.023 --> 14:21.150
There is nothing,
nada, zip!

14:21.192 --> 14:23.990
Yeah, unless you want
to work 40 hours a week.

14:24.028 --> 14:25.461
Pfft!

14:25.496 --> 14:27.623
Here. I'm going to
go to the store.

14:27.665 --> 14:29.530
Okay, just get
the bare essentials.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.364
This is the last
of our dough.

14:31.402 --> 14:33.996
Hey. What do I
look like?

14:34.038 --> 14:37.769
<i># Take a little walk
to the edge of town #</i>

14:37.809 --> 14:40.539

14:41.546 --> 14:44.174
<i># Where the viaduct looms #</i>

14:44.215 --> 14:46.149
<i># Like a bird of doom #</i>

change for a dollar?

15:30.194 --> 15:31.718
Change?

15:31.763 --> 15:33.628
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.

15:33.665 --> 15:35.690
Oh... well, uh,

15:35.733 --> 15:38.702
could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff here

15:38.736 --> 15:40.465
while I go
break a dollar?

15:40.505 --> 15:42.837
- Of course.
- Thanks.

15:42.874 --> 15:46.071
Hey. I guess
they're right.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.668
Senior citizens,

15:47.712 --> 15:50.237
although slow and dangerous
behind the wheel,

15:50.281 --> 15:53.114
can still serve
a purpose.

15:53.151 --> 15:56.416
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me!

16:01.159 --> 16:04.617
- Ugh!
- Where's the booze?

16:04.662 --> 16:07.495
I got robbed
by a sweet old lady

16:07.532 --> 16:10.092
on a motorized cart.

16:10.134 --> 16:12.295
I didn't even
see it coming.

16:12.337 --> 16:14.100
Oh...

16:14.138 --> 16:16.129
- Harry?
- No...

16:16.174 --> 16:18.404
- No...
- Harry. Come on, Harry.

16:18.443 --> 16:20.172
Cheer up.

16:20.211 --> 16:22.270
It gets worse, Lloyd.

16:22.313 --> 16:24.247
My parakeet Petey...

16:24.282 --> 16:27.342
- Yeah?
...he's dead.

16:27.385 --> 16:30.183
(gasps)

16:30.221 --> 16:31.779
Aw...

16:31.823 --> 16:33.757
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, Harry.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.782
What happened?

16:36.828 --> 16:38.796
His head fell off.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.730
His head fell off?

16:40.765 --> 16:43.131
Yeah, he was pretty old.

16:46.437 --> 16:47.802
Ugh!

16:47.839 --> 16:49.773
That's it.

16:49.807 --> 16:52.275
I've had it
with this dump!

16:52.310 --> 16:55.245
We got no food.
We got no jobs.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.248
(yells)
Our pets' heads are falling off!

16:57.283 --> 16:59.216
Okay, just calm down!

16:59.250 --> 17:01.582
What the hell are we
doing here, Harry?

17:01.619 --> 17:03.746
We gotta get
out of this town!

17:03.788 --> 17:06.348
Yeah? And go where?
Where are we gonna go?

17:06.391 --> 17:09.258
I'll tell you where,

17:09.292 --> 17:11.193
someplace warm...

17:11.229 --> 17:13.527
a place where the beer
flows like wine,

17:13.564 --> 17:15.656
where beautiful women
instinctively flock

17:15.700 --> 17:17.998
like the salmon
of Capistrano.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.634
I'm talking about
a little place called...

17:21.672 --> 17:24.402
Aspen.

17:24.442 --> 17:27.605
I don't know, Lloyd.
The French are assholes.

17:27.645 --> 17:30.079
Wait a minute.

17:32.316 --> 17:34.648
Wait a minute!
I know what you're up to, mister.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.381
Yeah! You just
wanna go to Aspen

17:37.422 --> 17:39.856
and find that girl
who lost her briefcase,

17:39.891 --> 17:42.257
<i>and you need me
to drive you there!</i>

17:42.293 --> 17:44.659
- Right? Am I right?
- Yeah. So?

17:44.695 --> 17:48.096
- Am I right? Am I right?
- Yeah! So?

17:48.132 --> 17:50.396
So I wanna go someplace
where we know somebody

17:50.435 --> 17:52.403
who can plug us into
the social pipeline.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.735
No! No no no!
No, Lloyd!

17:54.772 --> 17:57.570
No! I say we stay here,
we hunt for jobs,

17:57.608 --> 18:00.202
and we keep saving our money
for the worm store!

18:00.244 --> 18:02.508
<i>I don't know about you,</i>

18:02.547 --> 18:04.208

sick and tired

of-of running
from creditors!

18:05.750 --> 18:09.379
You know what I'm sick
and tired of, Harry?

18:11.255 --> 18:14.884
I'm sick and tired of having to
eke my way through life.

18:19.297 --> 18:21.458
I'm sick and tired
of being a nobody.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.894
<i>But most of all...</i>

18:29.207 --> 18:32.404
I'm sick and tired
of having nobody.

18:33.444 --> 18:34.706
<i>(soft piano music
playing)</i>

18:34.745 --> 18:36.770
Okay, Lloyd.

18:40.451 --> 18:42.612
Aspen it is.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.248
You'd better not
be foolin'.

18:48.292 --> 18:50.089
(chuckles)

18:52.430 --> 18:54.261
(crying)

18:54.298 --> 18:57.267
Okay okay,

18:57.301 --> 18:59.326
just let it out.
Have a good cry.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.338
Come on.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.169
Okay.

19:03.207 --> 19:05.675
(sobbing)

19:05.710 --> 19:07.812
Okay, that's enough.

19:13.951 --> 19:16.215
<i># I never met a girl #</i>

19:45.483 --> 19:47.348
Lloyd,
what are you doing?

19:47.385 --> 19:49.580
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate, Harry.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.747
Would you quit it?
We're not even through Connecticut yet,

19:51.789 --> 19:52.983
and already
you're annoying me.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.515
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.757
<i>- We're really doing it, aren't we?
- Yeah.</i>

19:59.764 --> 20:01.391
Hey, where'd
you get those?

20:01.432 --> 20:04.868
I bought them
when we filled up.

20:04.902 --> 20:06.927
Well... (stutters)
We're supposed to talk

20:06.971 --> 20:08.734
about all
expenditures, Lloyd.

20:08.773 --> 20:10.604
We're on a very
tight budget.

20:10.641 --> 20:12.871
This didn't come out
of our travel fund.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.377
Oh.

20:14.412 --> 20:16.312
No, I was able to raise
25 extra bucks

20:16.347 --> 20:18.713
before we left.

20:18.749 --> 20:20.979
Where did you get
25 extra bucks?

20:21.018 --> 20:24.249
I sold some stuff
to Billy in 4C.

20:24.288 --> 20:26.688
The blind kid?

20:26.724 --> 20:28.817
Yeah!

20:28.859 --> 20:30.554
Yeah.

20:30.595 --> 20:33.029
What did you
sell him, Lloyd?

20:34.632 --> 20:36.395
Stuff.

20:36.434 --> 20:39.892
- What kind of stuff?
- I don't know.

20:39.937 --> 20:42.030
A few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

20:42.073 --> 20:44.234
(coughs)
Petey.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.744
Petey?

20:47.778 --> 20:50.679
You sold my dead bird
to a blind kid?

20:50.715 --> 20:53.878
Lloyd, that-that...
what are you...

20:53.918 --> 20:56.409
Petey didn't even
have a head!

20:56.454 --> 20:59.787
Harry,
I took care of it.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.528
Pretty bird.

21:04.562 --> 21:06.359
Yeah. Can you say,
"pretty bird"?

21:06.397 --> 21:07.955
Pretty bird.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.627
Yes, pretty bird.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.761
Pretty bird.

21:16.073 --> 21:18.098
Polly want a cracker?

21:21.812 --> 21:23.439
Those rat bastards.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.608
They're rubbing it
right in our faces.

21:25.650 --> 21:27.641
Man, Andre'll have
a goddamn hemorrhage

21:27.685 --> 21:29.482
if we don't get
that briefcase back.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.545
They must have been
following us for weeks.

21:31.589 --> 21:34.786
- Why you say?
- "Gas Man."

21:34.825 --> 21:37.487
How the hell do
they know that I got gas?

21:37.528 --> 21:39.621
They gotta be pros.

21:40.998 --> 21:43.762
Don't worry.
We're going to get that money back.

21:44.835 --> 21:47.463
And I'll tell you
something else,

21:47.505 --> 21:49.496
they ain't never
getting to Aspen.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.804
I'm going to see to that.

21:57.448 --> 21:59.439
<i>Lloyd:
They got The Monkees.</i>

21:59.483 --> 22:01.542
They were a major influence
on The Beatles.

22:01.585 --> 22:03.883
Yeah, I know.

22:05.022 --> 22:07.081
<i>Excuse me, Flo?</i>

22:07.124 --> 22:09.649
(both laughing)

22:15.833 --> 22:18.165
Flo, like the TV show.

22:19.704 --> 22:22.673
Uh... what is
the "soup du jour"?

22:22.707 --> 22:24.368
It's the soup of the day.

22:24.408 --> 22:26.069
Mm-hmm...

22:26.110 --> 22:28.237
That sounds good.
I'll have that.

22:29.547 --> 22:31.811
Anything else
before I leave the area?

22:31.849 --> 22:33.612
No... yeah...

22:33.651 --> 22:35.516
yes yes,
my soda's flat.

22:35.553 --> 22:37.851
It doesn't have
any bubbles.

22:45.062 --> 22:46.825
Happy now?

22:51.068 --> 22:53.866
Feels good to mingle
with these laid-back country folk,

22:53.904 --> 22:57.965
don't it, Harr?
I like it a lot.

22:59.543 --> 23:02.671
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's the matter?

23:03.914 --> 23:05.745
(blows)

23:05.783 --> 23:08.513
You spilled the salt,
that's what's the matter.

23:08.552 --> 23:11.578
Spilling the salt
is very bad luck.

23:11.622 --> 23:13.647
We're driving
across the country.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.852
The last thing we need
is bad luck.

23:15.893 --> 23:19.385
Quick. Toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

23:21.866 --> 23:24.699
<i>(thumps)</i>

23:24.735 --> 23:28.193
Uh-oh, too little
too late, Harry.

23:30.741 --> 23:34.472
Who's the dead man
that hit me with the salt shaker?

23:34.512 --> 23:36.878

23:39.083 --> 23:42.109

23:44.054 --> 23:46.488
<i>Harry:
Well... uh...</i>

23:46.524 --> 23:48.048
it was a terrible
mistake, sir.

23:48.092 --> 23:50.492
Please, believe me.
I would never do anything

23:50.528 --> 23:52.052
to offend a man
of your size.

23:52.096 --> 23:54.360
Kick his ass,
Sea Bass!

23:57.535 --> 23:59.025
You gonna eat that?

23:59.069 --> 24:00.764
What? That?
No... yes... no.

24:00.805 --> 24:02.796
Well... no,
it crossed my mind.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.899
Yeah.

24:04.942 --> 24:08.343
(snorts, hawks)

24:18.989 --> 24:20.752
Still want it?

24:20.791 --> 24:23.783
Nah, you go ahead.

24:28.999 --> 24:32.196
You really
wimped out, man.

24:32.236 --> 24:34.227
What are you talking about,
wimped out?

24:34.271 --> 24:37.240
Well-well, did you...
the guy hawked on my burger!

24:37.274 --> 24:39.504
Hey, wait a second.

24:39.543 --> 24:41.807
I think I just...

24:41.846 --> 24:44.838
Yeah...
I just had an idea.

24:49.186 --> 24:51.416
Follow me.

24:53.157 --> 24:55.250
Whew.

24:58.262 --> 25:00.093
<i>Lloyd:
Excuse me. Guys?</i>

25:00.130 --> 25:01.825
What the hell
do you want?

25:01.866 --> 25:05.233
Uh... I just want
to apologize

25:05.269 --> 25:07.066
for that uh...
unpleasant scene

25:07.104 --> 25:08.799
a little earlier.

25:08.839 --> 25:12.240
My friend Harry and I
would, uh...

25:12.276 --> 25:14.608
like to buy
you guys a...

25:14.645 --> 25:16.636
round of beers...

25:16.680 --> 25:18.580
just to bury
the hatchet.

25:18.616 --> 25:20.846
Make it
four boilermakers.

25:20.885 --> 25:22.785
Whatever you want, sir.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.812
I'll have the waitress
bring it over immediately.

25:27.324 --> 25:29.622
- Lloyd, what are you doing?
- (shushing)

25:29.660 --> 25:31.821
We can't afford
to buy them drinks.

25:34.732 --> 25:36.893
Um... excuse me.

25:36.934 --> 25:40.802
Sea Bass and the fellas
offered to pick up our check.

25:40.838 --> 25:43.363
They said just put it
on their tab.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.232
They're very nice.

25:47.244 --> 25:49.235
Sea Bass said that?

25:49.280 --> 25:51.680
Well, if uh...

25:51.715 --> 25:54.445
that guy at the table
over there is Sea Bass.

25:58.856 --> 26:01.086
Ah! Uh.

26:02.092 --> 26:04.788
All right,
if that's what he wants.

26:05.796 --> 26:07.764
Put these
on there too, okay?

26:07.798 --> 26:10.164
You got it.

26:15.406 --> 26:18.136
I'm gonna kill
those sons of bitches!

26:19.143 --> 26:21.161

26:21.196 --> 26:23.179

26:23.213 --> 26:25.738
That was genius, Lloyd,
sheer genius!

26:25.783 --> 26:28.115
I mean, where did you come up
with a scam like that?

26:28.152 --> 26:31.918
- Saw it in a movie once.
- That was incredible!

26:31.956 --> 26:34.390
So what happened?
So the guy tricks some sucker

26:34.425 --> 26:37.326
into picking up his tab,
then gets away with it scot-free?

26:37.361 --> 26:40.990
No, in the movie, they catch up to him
a half-mile down the road

26:41.031 --> 26:44.228
and slit his throat.
It was a good one!

27:33.851 --> 27:36.183
The bottle's almost full

27:36.220 --> 27:39.189
- So stop going.
- I can't stop going once I've started.

27:39.223 --> 27:41.157
It stings.

27:41.191 --> 27:42.715
Quick! Get me

27:42.760 --> 27:43.988

- Come on.

- Pull over!

28:22.199 --> 28:24.793
No, it's a cardigan,
but thanks for noticing.

28:24.835 --> 28:27.861
Yeah.
Killer boots, man!

28:27.905 --> 28:31.568
Pull your vehicle

You, uh...

No. Oh no, sir.

28:59.837 --> 29:01.202
- No no no.
- No, huh-uh.

29:01.238 --> 29:04.139
Yeah, well,
what's that?

29:05.809 --> 29:08.243
- That's nothing, sir.
- Yeah, nothing.

29:08.278 --> 29:11.338
Yeah well, you aware that
it's against the law

29:11.381 --> 29:13.178
to have an open
alcohol container

29:13.217 --> 29:15.048
here in the State
of Pennsylvania?

Don't drink...</i>

You'd keep
your mouth shut

good for you, buddy.

29:59.963 --> 30:03.865
<i>Mary: How could they not
have gotten the ransom?</i>

30:03.901 --> 30:05.493
It just doesn't
make sense.

30:05.536 --> 30:08.528
I left the money exactly where they
instructed me to.

30:08.572 --> 30:10.335
<i>Woman: Oh, it makes
perfect sense, Mary.</i>

30:10.374 --> 30:12.205
We should have called
the authorities

30:12.242 --> 30:14.039
the minute we knew
that Bobby was kidnapped.

30:14.077 --> 30:15.908
Now, Helen, we've been
through this already.

30:15.946 --> 30:18.881
<i>- Mr. Andre.
- Nicholas.</i>

30:18.916 --> 30:22.215
- Karl.
- Nick Nick Nick.

30:22.252 --> 30:23.879
Any word yet, sir?

30:23.921 --> 30:25.889
No, nothing yet,
Nicholas.

30:25.923 --> 30:27.891
(sighs)

30:27.925 --> 30:29.893
I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

30:29.927 --> 30:31.986
Maybe we should cancel

30:32.029 --> 30:34.088
the preservation benefit
this weekend.

30:34.131 --> 30:35.996
It would be so easy
to reschedule it.

30:36.033 --> 30:38.467
No, I don't think we should do anything
out of the ordinary.

30:38.502 --> 30:41.528
Yeah, she's right. It's imperative that we
carry on as usual...

30:41.572 --> 30:43.267
- Okay.
...especially you, Mary.

30:43.307 --> 30:45.036
What am I
supposed to do,

30:45.075 --> 30:47.270
just go about my life
like everything is fine?

30:47.311 --> 30:49.142
That's exactly
what you should do.

30:49.179 --> 30:51.306
Yes, go skiing, go to parties,
act normally, you know.

30:51.348 --> 30:52.940
Yeah, don't you see,
honey?

30:52.983 --> 30:54.848
We can't let on
that anything's wrong.

30:54.885 --> 30:57.080
If the press or the authorities
get wind of this,

30:57.120 --> 30:58.553
the kidnappers
may panic.

30:58.589 --> 31:01.114
Mm. I mean,
you never know

31:01.158 --> 31:03.126
what they might
do to him then.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.596

31:57.447 --> 32:00.314
<i># I love

32:00.350 --> 32:02.215
So he says,
"Do you love me?"

32:02.252 --> 32:05.278
And she says, "No, but that's
a real nice ski mask."

Some little filly break your heart?

37:28.745 --> 37:30.337
No, it was a girl.

- Fraida Felcher.

37:31.915 --> 37:34.281
Yeah, we stayed in a place
just like this.

Wasn't this classy,

Felcher?
From Cranston?

Yeah.
You know her?

Oh, yeah!

I mean,
I remember you...

37:45.428 --> 37:47.794
talking about her.

37:47.831 --> 37:52.268
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

37:52.302 --> 37:54.395
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

37:54.437 --> 37:56.735
and then about a week later,
right out of the blue,

37:56.773 --> 37:58.434
she sends me
a John Deere letter.

37:58.475 --> 38:01.569
- She give you any reason?
- Yeah, I called her up.

38:01.611 --> 38:03.306

a bunch of crap

enough or something.

38:05.715 --> 38:07.615
I don't know.
I wasn't really paying attention.

38:07.651 --> 38:09.585
But the thing
that hurt the most

38:09.619 --> 38:12.247
is I think she was
seeing another guy.

38:15.558 --> 38:18.857
Never did
find out who.

- Yeah. The boys are holed up

38:53.430 --> 38:55.295

for the night.

38:55.332 --> 38:58.028

a little bit strange.

38:58.068 --> 39:00.662
What the hell are
these guys up to?

39:00.704 --> 39:02.934
I mean, is it possible
that they could be feds?

39:02.972 --> 39:05.600
Highly unlikely
from what I've seen.

39:15.985 --> 39:18.681
Oh, you turned
your back on me.

39:18.722 --> 39:21.088
Ho ho ho!
He got me mad. I almost like it.

39:21.124 --> 39:23.319
You and Shay were
supposed to grab that bag

39:23.360 --> 39:25.487
- so we could end this shit!
- Here's your drink, baby.

39:25.528 --> 39:28.964
Do you know the damage
I could do to you?

39:28.998 --> 39:32.593
Hold on a minute.

39:32.635 --> 39:34.728
Hmm.

39:34.771 --> 39:36.500
But that's not
your problem.

39:36.539 --> 39:38.473
You didn't know.

39:38.508 --> 39:41.204
Get off
the phone.

39:43.079 --> 39:46.708
Get off the pho...

39:49.686 --> 39:51.984
I'm sorry, Mr. Andre.
You were saying?

39:52.021 --> 39:53.955
Look, Mental,

39:53.990 --> 39:56.652
these jokers have got a lot of money
and it belongs to me!

39:56.693 --> 39:59.594
Now, I want to know who they are
and what they're doing with it!

39:59.629 --> 40:02.826
Hey hey hey, I told you already.
I'm on it.

40:02.866 --> 40:06.063
- All right?
- Good.

40:09.606 --> 40:10.355
Harry:
According to the map,

40:10.390 --> 40:11.104
Harry:
According to the map,

40:11.141 --> 40:12.768
we've only gone
about four inches.

40:12.809 --> 40:14.504
You know,
I don't think

40:14.544 --> 40:15.977
we have enough
gas money.

40:16.012 --> 40:19.470
Relax. We have
more than enough.

40:19.516 --> 40:21.484
I think
you're wrong, Lloyd.

40:21.518 --> 40:22.815
How much
you wanna bet?

40:22.852 --> 40:24.513
I don't bet.

40:24.554 --> 40:25.987
What do you mean,
you don't bet?

40:26.022 --> 40:27.717
I mean I don't bet.
I don't gamble.

40:27.757 --> 40:29.782
(deep voice)
Pussy pussy pussy!

40:29.826 --> 40:32.852
- I never have, and I never will.
- Yeah, right!

40:32.896 --> 40:35.626
I'll bet you 20 bucks
I can get you gambling

40:35.665 --> 40:37.758
- before the end of the day.
- No way.

40:37.801 --> 40:39.462
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
- Nope.

40:39.502 --> 40:40.662
- 5-to-1?
- Nope.

40:40.703 --> 40:42.898

- You're on.

40:42.939 --> 40:45.305

40:46.509 --> 40:47.942
I'm going
to get you.

40:47.977 --> 40:50.810
- Huh-uh.
- Oh, yeah.

40:50.847 --> 40:52.974
I don't know how,
but I'm going to get you.

40:53.016 --> 40:56.144
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Nuh-uh.

40:56.186 --> 40:57.949
Come on, Joe.
Let me do them.

40:57.987 --> 40:59.784
Let me do
both of them.

40:59.823 --> 41:01.381
You wouldn't even have
to worry about it.

41:01.424 --> 41:02.948
Just shut up!

41:02.992 --> 41:05.119
Now, we don't even know
who the hell they are.

41:05.161 --> 41:07.152
You don't kill people
you don't know.

41:07.197 --> 41:08.596
That's a rule.

you follow us. You got that?

Keep your shirt on.
I gotta squeeze a lemon.

Say, uh, are you guys
going to Davenport?

41:43.533 --> 41:46.866
My car died, and I'm late
for a luncheon.

41:48.004 --> 41:52.168
We usually don't
pick up hitchhikers,

41:52.208 --> 41:56.008
but I'm going to go with my instinct
on this one.

41:56.045 --> 41:58.513
Saddle up, partner.

41:59.883 --> 42:01.680
You're it.

42:01.718 --> 42:03.743
- You're it.
- You're it! Quitsies!

42:03.786 --> 42:05.845
Anti-quitsies.
You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies.

42:05.889 --> 42:07.186
- No startsies.
- You can't do that.

42:07.223 --> 42:09.191
- Can too.
- Cannot. Stamped it.

42:09.225 --> 42:10.749
Can too. Double-stamped it.
No erasies.

42:10.793 --> 42:13.091
Cannot. Triple-stamped it.
No erasies.

42:13.129 --> 42:15.723
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp!

42:15.765 --> 42:18.666
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

42:18.701 --> 42:20.692
You can't triple-stamp a double-stamp.
Lloyd! Lloyd!

42:20.737 --> 42:22.432

42:33.783 --> 42:36.809
Guys! Guys! Guys!

42:38.254 --> 42:42.281
Fellas,
you think we could

42:42.325 --> 42:44.793

42:46.029 --> 42:47.997
Radio?

45:52.849 --> 45:55.010
It just doesn't seem like
you packed much.

All I saw was one bag
and that briefcase.

45:58.154 --> 46:00.452
Well, no no, the briefcase
isn't even ours.

46:00.490 --> 46:02.287

Oh, my ulcer!

Quick!
My pills!

call an ambulance.

you're dead meat.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.994
But he blamed me.
You heard him.

48:20.029 --> 48:21.894
Those were
his last words.

48:23.399 --> 48:25.560
Not if you count
the gurgling sound.

- No doubt about it.

next to the body.

48:35.645 --> 48:37.545

- Yeah?

Waitress says he came in with
a couple of younger guys.

48:40.349 --> 48:43.648
Now they're the ones who called the
ambulance, and then they hit the road.

48:43.686 --> 48:46.416
- Get any idea where they were going?
- We just received a report

48:46.455 --> 48:49.447

towards Colorado.

48:49.492 --> 48:51.585

- I'm moving to Aspen.
- Oh.

51:44.200 --> 51:47.226
I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz.

51:47.269 --> 51:50.067
Plus, my astrologer told me that
I really should stay away

51:50.106 --> 51:52.404
from accident-prone guys,
so, you know.

51:52.441 --> 51:54.068

- Mm. Thank you.
- Oh, no. Hey, no, allow me.

to Aspen myself.

52:18.868 --> 52:20.563
Maybe we could,
you know, meet up,

52:20.603 --> 52:22.628
have some hot chocolate
or something.

52:23.873 --> 52:26.364
Sure, why not?
You seem harmless.

52:26.408 --> 52:27.773
I'm going to
give you my number.

52:27.810 --> 52:29.641

52:29.678 --> 52:31.839

- That's... ah!

52:31.881 --> 52:34.145

- Look, why don't you

52:34.183 --> 52:36.117
just tell it to me?
I got a really good memory.

52:36.152 --> 52:38.313

That's my old number.

your mind just goes blank.

give me the damn number!

No, sir, but we're
expecting them shortly.

54:00.970 --> 54:04.098

back headed this way.

54:08.644 --> 54:12.273

So just drop it.

54:12.314 --> 54:14.441

Look! Look!

01:04:30.098 --> 01:04:32.396
Okay, here's the plan:

01:04:32.434 --> 01:04:35.301
We borrow a few bucks...
just a small loan from the briefcase

01:04:35.337 --> 01:04:38.363
- and we find some reasonable lodgings.
- Good plan.

01:04:38.406 --> 01:04:41.102
And we'll keep track of all the money
we spend with IOUs.

01:04:41.142 --> 01:04:43.372
We'll be meticulous,
right down to the last penny.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:45.845
- Whatever we borrow, we pay back.
- Absolutely.

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:48.281
- We're good for it.
- Our word is our bond.

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:51.976

Get over there

01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:27.805
She's just going to think
I'm some kind of a psycho

01:12:27.842 --> 01:12:30.072
when she finds out
how far I came just to see her!

01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:31.976
You know what you have?!
Her briefcase!

01:12:32.013 --> 01:12:35.005

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:45.926
And that way,
you can build me up

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.928
so I won't have to
brag about myself later.

01:12:47.962 --> 01:12:49.896
Tell her I'm rich

01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:52.399
and, uh,
I'm good-looking

01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:54.458

I don't think I could... no.

01:12:56.604 --> 01:12:59.368

Are you
a bird lover?

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:39.002
Me? Oh, no.
Well, I used to have a parakeet...

01:13:39.046 --> 01:13:41.947
- Ah.
...but now my main area of expertise

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:44.474
is, uh, canines...

01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:46.646
"dogs"

01:13:47.655 --> 01:13:49.850
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:50.858 --> 01:13:53.827
- I love dogs too.
- Oh.

01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:56.125
- So how are you involved with them?
- Oh, you know,

01:13:56.164 --> 01:13:59.133
I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them.

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:00.930
- I've even bred them.
- Oh, really?

01:14:00.968 --> 01:14:02.936
- Any unusual breeding?
- No.

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.029
Mostly just doggy-style.

was to...</i>

01:14:32.099 --> 01:14:35.034
<i>I've got to introduce you
to a buddy of mine.</i>

01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:38.527
- I don't believe I've met your friend.
- Oh.

01:14:38.573 --> 01:14:41.064
Well, actually, we haven't been
properly introduced.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:43.872
- My name is Mary Swanson.
- Hi, Harry Dunne.

01:14:43.911 --> 01:14:46.641
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my stepmother Helen.

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:48.945
Hi. Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

01:14:48.983 --> 01:14:51.178
Mm-hmm. Well,
I saw you come in.

01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.517
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to meet you.

01:14:53.554 --> 01:14:57.752
- You were? Really?
- Yes! That tuxedo, it's fabulous!

01:14:57.792 --> 01:15:00.590
Really. I love a man
with a sense of humor,

01:15:00.628 --> 01:15:03.495
and so does Mary.
It's hysterical!

01:15:03.531 --> 01:15:05.089
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:08.124
<i>Oh. Anyway, um,
about my friend...</i>

01:15:08.169 --> 01:15:11.502
What are you doing tomorrow?
I believe that Mary

01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:13.200
is looking for someone
to hit the slopes with.

01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:14.970
She... what? Huh?

01:15:15.009 --> 01:15:17.944
Helen, you're
embarrassing me.

01:15:17.979 --> 01:15:19.947
Well, you are.
I mean, after all,

01:15:19.981 --> 01:15:22.108
the snow's going to be gone
in a couple of weeks.

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:24.014
And, well, this may be
your last chance.

01:15:24.051 --> 01:15:26.144
Poor thing, she never
gets a chance to get out.

01:15:26.187 --> 01:15:28.849
Well, what do you say, Mr. Dunne?
Are you available?

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:31.188
Well, I don't know.
See, my friend...

01:15:31.225 --> 01:15:33.090
Oh, forget your friend
for one day.

01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:36.221
I think you kids'll have
a wonderful time. What do you say?

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:38.494
Well, you know,
I don't know, you know.

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.967
You know, the thing...
part of... sure.

01:15:41.002 --> 01:15:44.130
What time?
Ahem...

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:50.033
How come you didn't
bring her over?

01:15:50.077 --> 01:15:52.045
Relax.
You're golden.

01:15:52.079 --> 01:15:54.513
- I got you a date with her tomorrow.
- Oh.

01:15:56.117 --> 01:15:58.551
- (stammers) What... I... this...
- Yeah.

01:15:58.586 --> 01:16:00.850
- I love you, man.
- Okay okay.

01:16:00.888 --> 01:16:02.719
- You're kissing me.
- I love you.

01:16:02.757 --> 01:16:05.225
- I love you!
- You're kissing me. Lloyd!

01:16:07.628 --> 01:16:10.256
This calls for
a little of the bubbly!

01:16:10.298 --> 01:16:12.528
- You're going to be my best man, Harr.
- Oh, good.

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.125
- I promise.
- Thank you.

01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:16.136
You have just
earned yourself a seat

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:20.129
at the head table, pal.
And we already got the tuxes.

01:16:21.342 --> 01:16:23.276
<i>- (loud thud)
- (owl squawks)</i>

01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:29.313
<i>- Woman: Gracious sakes!
- (crowd murmuring)</i>

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:33.013
<i>- Man: Good grief!
- Boy, this party really died.</i>

01:16:40.124 --> 01:16:42.615
Hey, maybe it was
a coincidence.

01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:45.184
(mimics)
Hey, maybe it was a coincidence.

01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:48.687
It was a message, Shay,
pure and simple.

01:16:48.732 --> 01:16:50.927
I mean, we killed
their bird.

01:16:50.968 --> 01:16:53.994
Now they killed
one of ours.

01:16:55.939 --> 01:16:57.998
How could anybody
whack a bird with a cork?

01:16:58.041 --> 01:17:00.339
These guys aren't
just anybody.

01:17:00.377 --> 01:17:03.437
They're good.

01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:11.651
Mary Christmas.

01:17:11.688 --> 01:17:14.452
Mrs. Mary Christmas.

01:17:16.026 --> 01:17:19.427
- Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?
- Yeah yeah, that sounds nice.

01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:22.864
But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be
jumping the gun a little bit?

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.834
I mean, you know,
who knows?

01:17:24.868 --> 01:17:26.733
You know, maybe,
once you get to know her

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:29.102
you'll find out
that she's not your type.

01:17:31.175 --> 01:17:32.938
Hey!

01:17:32.976 --> 01:17:36.139
Don't you ever
say that again!

01:17:37.214 --> 01:17:39.205
She is the love
of my life!

01:17:39.249 --> 01:17:41.683
The blood in my veins!

01:17:41.718 --> 01:17:43.413
<i>We belong together...</i>

01:17:43.453 --> 01:17:45.751
till the mountains
fall into the sea,

01:17:45.789 --> 01:17:47.689
till the heavens
collide!

01:17:47.724 --> 01:17:50.318
Or until I get sick of her
and need to move on.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.796
- You hear me?!
- Okay okay okay okay. Just calm down.

01:17:53.831 --> 01:17:55.696
Just calm down.

01:17:55.732 --> 01:17:58.223
(panting)
Okay.

01:17:58.268 --> 01:18:01.328
Now...

01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:03.839
let me
get this straight.

01:18:03.874 --> 01:18:07.071
Lobby bar
in the lobby.

01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:08.873
Yeah, and that's
what she said.

01:18:08.912 --> 01:18:11.142
She'll meet you there
at 10:00 sharp.

01:18:12.216 --> 01:18:14.343
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.150
Where're you going
in that get-up?

01:18:20.824 --> 01:18:22.815
Oh. I... you know, I just thought,
you know,

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.953
when you'd be off making
your love connection

01:18:24.995 --> 01:18:27.293
I'd be out trying my luck
on the slopes.

01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:29.299
You mean you're gonna
go out in public

01:18:29.333 --> 01:18:31.324
dressed in tights?

01:18:31.368 --> 01:18:33.302
Oh no, these aren't
tights, Lloyd.

01:18:33.337 --> 01:18:35.805
These are fashionable
Euro-trash ski trousers.

01:18:35.839 --> 01:18:38.137
Pretty revealing.

01:18:39.142 --> 01:18:40.439
Really?

01:18:40.477 --> 01:18:42.502
Yeah, but it's
just a tiny lump.

01:18:42.546 --> 01:18:44.946
No one'll notice.

01:18:44.982 --> 01:18:47.542
You're right.
I can't go out dressed like this.

01:18:49.786 --> 01:18:51.382

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:52.979

Beautiful outfit,
sir.

01:19:38.201 --> 01:19:40.260
There you go.

Hey.
How you doin'?

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:55.511
You're a little early.

01:19:55.552 --> 01:19:58.521
We don't open
for about 45 minutes.

01:19:58.555 --> 01:20:00.955
I'm meeting
someone here.

01:20:00.991 --> 01:20:05.223
- Mind if I wait at the bar?
- No. Come on in.

01:20:07.631 --> 01:20:10.259
It's a beautiful day,
huh, Harry?

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.100
Yes yes, I've had a wonderful time
so far. Thank you.

01:20:14.137 --> 01:20:17.072
God, it feels
so good to get up here.

01:20:17.107 --> 01:20:20.543
I haven't been outside that much
in the last couple weeks.

01:20:20.577 --> 01:20:23.011
Oh, yeah?
Why not?

01:20:23.046 --> 01:20:26.914
Um, there's been
some family problems,

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:29.919
but I don't want
to bore you with those.

01:20:29.953 --> 01:20:31.944
Thanks.

01:20:31.989 --> 01:20:34.423
Oh, look. Frost.

01:20:37.661 --> 01:20:41.290
- Harry?
- (grunting)

01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:45.164
- Are you okay?
- (muffled) Oh, yeah,

01:20:45.202 --> 01:20:48.399
I do this all the time.

01:20:51.975 --> 01:20:54.273
Let's go to the top
this time.

01:21:01.218 --> 01:21:05.177
<i>- Hi, there.
- Ugh...</i>

01:21:05.222 --> 01:21:06.951
Say, kids,

01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:08.890
you wouldn't
happen to have

01:21:08.925 --> 01:21:11.018
a cup of warm water,
would you?

01:21:11.061 --> 01:21:13.689
(slurps)
Yuck.

01:21:17.434 --> 01:21:19.402
Excuse me.

01:21:19.436 --> 01:21:21.631
Is it 10:00 A.M. Yet?

01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:24.800
It's 1:00.

01:21:27.477 --> 01:21:31.607
That's what I have too.
Thought maybe it was fast.

01:21:34.618 --> 01:21:37.314
She's running late,
huh?

01:21:37.354 --> 01:21:40.619
Just a couple hours.
You know girls.

01:21:40.657 --> 01:21:43.353
When they're excited
about something,

01:21:43.393 --> 01:21:45.725
everything has to
be perfect.

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:55.329
This one's on me.

01:21:57.474 --> 01:21:59.465
Yippee.

01:21:59.509 --> 01:22:01.443
Chablis, please.

01:22:02.446 --> 01:22:04.641
Hello.

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.713
Bad day, huh?

01:22:13.723 --> 01:22:16.123
Me too.

01:22:16.159 --> 01:22:18.024
'Course everything's
been bad

01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:20.291
since I broke up
with my boyfriend.

01:22:33.376 --> 01:22:35.810
(whispers)
Oh my God.

01:22:39.049 --> 01:22:41.279
My God! You poor guy.
Does it hurt?

01:22:41.318 --> 01:22:44.219
I'm fine. I saved
a seat for you.

01:22:44.254 --> 01:22:46.017
(taps)

01:22:46.056 --> 01:22:47.751
Oh no, listen. This is silly.
Let me help you.

01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:49.691
No no no no no.

01:22:49.726 --> 01:22:52.058
Yes. It'll only hurt for a moment,
like a Band-Aid.

01:22:52.095 --> 01:22:54.529
<i>- Come on, ready?
- No no no no. No.</i>

01:22:54.564 --> 01:22:56.395
Come on. Go.

01:24:45.575 --> 01:24:47.770
(laughing)

01:24:48.912 --> 01:24:50.880
I said to myself,
"Run, Beth.

Run for your life before this man
kills you both."

01:24:53.717 --> 01:24:56.379

what the klutz did?

<i>No, and I don't care!</i>

01:24:59.256 --> 01:25:02.123
I'm going to tell you, He came home
one night dead drunk

01:25:02.158 --> 01:25:04.217
and decided he wanted
to fix the sink.

01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:05.751
Couldn't believe him.

01:25:05.795 --> 01:25:08.229
Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

01:25:08.265 --> 01:25:10.495
- How come you're here?
- Bartender!

01:25:10.533 --> 01:25:12.728
Yeah?

01:25:12.769 --> 01:25:16.637
You wouldn't happen to know
a Mary Swanson, would you?

01:25:16.673 --> 01:25:19.506
Mary Swanson? Yeah.

01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:22.306
She comes in here
all the time.

01:25:22.345 --> 01:25:24.176
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:25:24.214 --> 01:25:25.647
She has dinner.

01:25:25.682 --> 01:25:29.778
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:25:32.188 --> 01:25:33.678
Uh...

01:25:33.723 --> 01:25:37.591
you know where
she lives?

01:25:37.627 --> 01:25:41.654
Yeah, her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

01:25:41.698 --> 01:25:44.826
Alpine Drive?
Big place?

01:25:52.575 --> 01:25:54.907
No way!

01:25:56.513 --> 01:25:58.572
That's great!

01:25:58.615 --> 01:26:00.981
We landed
on the moon!

01:26:07.691 --> 01:26:09.682
I've gotta tell you,

01:26:09.726 --> 01:26:12.354
today was just what I needed.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:15.193
(slurred)
Blell, blit blas...

01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:17.722
it was my pleasure,
Mary.

01:26:17.767 --> 01:26:20.702
So you'll pick me up
tonight at 7:45?

01:26:20.737 --> 01:26:22.568
Well, no, I've got
a few things

01:26:22.605 --> 01:26:24.232
to take care of first.

01:26:24.274 --> 01:26:25.935
Why don't we make it
quarter to 8:00?

01:26:25.975 --> 01:26:30.241
(laughs)
Stop it!

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.874
Okay 7:45.

01:26:34.351 --> 01:26:37.184
(kisses) Bye.

01:27:21.564 --> 01:27:23.555
Doesn't make
any sense, Lloyd.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.363
She told me
10:00 sharp!

01:27:25.402 --> 01:27:27.734
Are you sure you went
to the right bar?

01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:31.639
Oh, yeah. Yep.
I'm pretty sure.

01:27:31.674 --> 01:27:34.837
Lobby bar.
Right in the lobby.

01:27:34.878 --> 01:27:38.006
Ahh... well...

01:27:38.047 --> 01:27:40.845
maybe she just had
a change of heart.

01:27:40.884 --> 01:27:44.320
Oh, that pisses me off!
That pisses me right off!

01:27:44.354 --> 01:27:46.345
I hate when women
do that, you know?

01:27:46.389 --> 01:27:48.050
She wanted
to see you again!

01:27:48.091 --> 01:27:49.956
She told me that!
And now no?

01:27:49.993 --> 01:27:52.894
Now... wait a minute!
Wait!

01:27:52.929 --> 01:27:55.864
She must have meant
10:00 at night.

01:27:55.899 --> 01:27:58.424
Do you think?

01:27:58.468 --> 01:28:02.461
Why would she have you meet her
at a bar at 10:00 in the morning?

01:28:02.505 --> 01:28:04.666
I just figured she was
a raging alcoholic.

01:28:04.707 --> 01:28:07.699
(both laughing)

01:28:10.413 --> 01:28:12.677
- Oh, that's th...
- And all this time,

01:28:12.715 --> 01:28:16.617
I've been going through such pain
and personal anguish.

01:28:16.653 --> 01:28:19.713
Such hell!
For nothing!

01:28:19.756 --> 01:28:21.553
Oh, God.
That's funny.

01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:23.923
Oh, that's good stuff.
Oh, boy.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.690
Well, listen, looks like
you got your night planned,

01:28:26.729 --> 01:28:29.027
so I'm just going to head out
and catch a flick.

01:28:29.065 --> 01:28:30.726
Okay.

01:28:32.735 --> 01:28:35.101
10:00 in the morning.

01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:54.449

old buddy, old pal!

01:28:54.491 --> 01:28:56.118
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:28:56.159 --> 01:28:59.617
Will you join me in a good-luck toast
before you head out?

01:28:59.662 --> 01:29:03.063
Oh, sure thing. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

01:29:03.099 --> 01:29:05.465
Yes, sirree.

01:29:05.502 --> 01:29:07.766
You know why
I like you, Harry?

01:29:07.804 --> 01:29:10.034
Because you're
a regular guy.

01:29:11.474 --> 01:29:14.875
Yep, that's why I want you
to stay regular.

01:29:16.012 --> 01:29:20.813
1/2 teaspoon for fast,
effective relief.

your briefcase.

have a lot to do.

01:39:31.494 --> 01:39:34.588
Excuse me, gunman,
who are you?

01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:36.655
Don't play dumb
with me, asshole!

01:39:36.699 --> 01:39:39.566
I'm the rightful owner of that briefcase
you've been carrying around!

01:39:39.602 --> 01:39:41.729
Oh. Well, then...

01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:45.797
Nicholas, my family
trusted you.

01:39:45.841 --> 01:39:48.036
Shut up!

01:39:48.077 --> 01:39:52.070
Listen, Mr. Samsonite,
about the briefcase...

01:39:52.114 --> 01:39:54.139
my friend Harry and I
have every intention

01:39:54.183 --> 01:39:56.743
- of fully reimbursing you.
- What?

01:39:56.785 --> 01:40:00.312
You open it up.
Open it up!

01:40:00.356 --> 01:40:03.189
Go ahead, open it up.
Do what he says.

01:40:03.225 --> 01:40:04.988
Hurry.

01:40:09.865 --> 01:40:12.356
What is this?
What is this?

01:40:12.401 --> 01:40:14.096
Where's all the money?

01:40:14.136 --> 01:40:17.071
That's as good
as money, sir.

01:40:17.106 --> 01:40:19.597
Those are IOUs.
Go ahead and add it up.

01:40:19.642 --> 01:40:21.576
Every cent's
accounted for.

01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:24.545
Look. See this?

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.844
That's a car.
275 thou.

01:40:26.882 --> 01:40:29.043
Might want to hang on
to that one.

01:40:32.855 --> 01:40:35.881
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man!

01:40:40.863 --> 01:40:43.798
Lloyd, I'm home!

01:40:43.832 --> 01:40:47.131
Look, we've got to have
a serious talk.

01:40:47.169 --> 01:40:48.693
<i>I got a confession
to make.</i>

01:40:48.737 --> 01:40:50.568
Oh, good.
You found her.

01:40:50.606 --> 01:40:52.164
I'll leave
you two alone.

01:40:52.208 --> 01:40:54.403
No. Stay.

01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:57.379
Ugh!

01:41:00.849 --> 01:41:03.841
Yes, I'd like a one-way ticket
to Amsterdam

01:41:03.886 --> 01:41:06.582
departing as soon
as possible, please.

01:41:06.622 --> 01:41:09.216
How do you guys
know each other?

01:41:09.258 --> 01:41:11.192
We used to be
best friends.

01:41:11.227 --> 01:41:13.195
Yeah, until he turned
into a backstabber.

01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:16.255
<i>Me a backstabber?
You got a lot of nerve.</i>

01:41:16.298 --> 01:41:18.129
You knew I was
crazy about her!

01:41:18.167 --> 01:41:20.465
And you knew I was crazy
about Fraida Felcher,

01:41:20.502 --> 01:41:23.903
- and that didn't stop you, did it?
- (gasps)

01:41:23.939 --> 01:41:26.237
- What do you mean?
- (mimics) What do you mean?

01:41:26.275 --> 01:41:28.175
Don't deny it, Lloyd.

01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:31.475
Fraida told me the whole sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:36.875
Okay, what time does it...
what time does that leave?

01:41:36.919 --> 01:41:38.887
Thank you...
wait a second.

01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:40.855
Can I have
a vegetarian meal?

01:41:40.889 --> 01:41:43.289
I guess we both learned
a little something

01:41:43.325 --> 01:41:45.793
- about each other today, didn't we?
- Yeah, you said it, pal.

01:41:45.828 --> 01:41:47.489
Maybe we're not as good of
friends as we thought we were.

01:41:47.529 --> 01:41:48.461
I guess not.

01:41:48.497 --> 01:41:51.364
I mean, if one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this,

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.391
then maybe our friendship
isn't worth a damn.

01:41:53.435 --> 01:41:54.868
Maybe we should
call it quits right now.

01:41:54.903 --> 01:41:56.871
You just tell me
where to sign, bud.

01:41:56.905 --> 01:41:58.896
Right on my ass
after you kiss it!

01:41:58.941 --> 01:42:00.533
Kiss it?!
You kiss mine!

01:42:00.576 --> 01:42:02.737
Both cheeks, both lips,
right here!

01:42:02.778 --> 01:42:06.737
- Put it right...
- Shut up!

01:42:08.751 --> 01:42:11.481
Now, which one of you losers
wants to get it first?

01:42:12.955 --> 01:42:15.515
Over here...

01:42:15.557 --> 01:42:17.957
I was the one that got you into
this whole mess.

01:42:17.993 --> 01:42:20.291
Come on
and shoot me.

01:42:20.329 --> 01:42:23.355
No! Wait! Wait.
No no, do me first.

01:42:23.399 --> 01:42:25.492
I stole your girl, Lloyd.
I deserve it.

01:42:25.534 --> 01:42:26.967
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:42:27.002 --> 01:42:29.197
- No, you don't...
- Yes, I do!

01:42:29.238 --> 01:42:31.604
Yesterday was one of the greatest
days of my life.

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.770
Mary and I went skiing, we made
a snowman, she touched my leg.

01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:38.177
Okay, kill him!

01:42:44.653 --> 01:42:47.053
(sobbing)
Oh! Oh, no!

01:42:48.524 --> 01:42:51.789
You killed my best friend,
you bastard!

01:42:51.827 --> 01:42:53.454
If it's any consolation,

01:42:53.495 --> 01:42:55.656
you're about
to be reunited.

01:42:59.802 --> 01:43:01.736
(gun clicking)

01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:05.672
Harry!
You're alive!

01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:08.404
And you're
a horrible shot.

01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:10.503
Lucky me.

01:43:10.546 --> 01:43:13.014
Police! Open up!
Nobody move!

01:43:13.048 --> 01:43:16.415
Everybody freeze!
Get those hands up!

01:43:16.452 --> 01:43:17.942
<i>Not you, dummy!</i>

01:43:17.986 --> 01:43:19.544
<i>Man:
Get the gun.</i>

01:43:19.588 --> 01:43:22.284
Special Officer
Beth Jordan, FBI.

01:43:22.324 --> 01:43:23.882
Hey! Who?
But... huh?

01:43:23.926 --> 01:43:25.860
Mr. Dunne,
thank you very much.

01:43:25.894 --> 01:43:28.863
We couldn't have
done it without you.

01:43:28.897 --> 01:43:30.421
We've been
following you guys

01:43:30.466 --> 01:43:31.797
all the way
from Providence.

01:43:31.834 --> 01:43:33.631
What's going on,
Harry?

01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:36.968
Your name is Harry,
isn't it?

01:43:37.005 --> 01:43:40.532
Yeah, she-she grabbed me down the lobby,
explained what was up.

01:43:40.576 --> 01:43:42.669
Then they slapped
this bulletproof vest on me

01:43:42.711 --> 01:43:44.838
and gave me a gun.

01:43:46.615 --> 01:43:48.981
But what if he shot you
in the face?

01:43:50.052 --> 01:43:52.452
What if he shot me
in the face?

01:43:52.488 --> 01:43:54.786
That's a risk
we were willing to take.

01:43:54.823 --> 01:43:56.688
How come I didn't
get a gun?

01:43:56.725 --> 01:43:58.989
Did you
get a gun?

01:43:59.027 --> 01:44:03.657
<i># We can't play
this game anymore #</i>

01:44:03.699 --> 01:44:08.329
<i># But can we still
be friends? #</i>

01:44:09.972 --> 01:44:14.739
<i># Things just can't
go on like before #</i>

01:44:14.777 --> 01:44:19.441
<i># But can we still
be friends? #</i>

01:44:19.481 --> 01:44:24.942
<i># We had something
to learn #</i>

01:44:24.987 --> 01:44:26.955
<i># Now it's time... #</i>

01:44:26.989 --> 01:44:28.889
You were right,
Lloyd.

01:44:28.924 --> 01:44:30.983
She was definitely
worth the trip.

01:44:31.026 --> 01:44:35.554
Yeah. She's something,
ain't she, Harr?

01:44:35.597 --> 01:44:37.462
I'm glad we were able
to help her out.

01:44:37.499 --> 01:44:43.369
<i># You know
it's all gone #</i>

01:44:43.405 --> 01:44:47.341
<i># Let's admit
we made a mistake... #</i>

01:44:47.376 --> 01:44:49.105
- Honey!
- Easy easy.

01:44:49.144 --> 01:44:51.510
- You're okay.
- Okay, I'm just a little sore.

01:44:51.547 --> 01:44:54.414
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie.

01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:56.714
<i>Oh, baby, I missed
your loving.</i>

01:44:56.752 --> 01:44:59.016
Honey, there's someone
I want to introduce you to.

01:44:59.054 --> 01:45:01.488
He's the kindest,
gentlest man I've ever met.

01:45:01.523 --> 01:45:03.354
- Will you meet him?
- Sure.

01:45:03.392 --> 01:45:05.758
He's got a gun!

01:45:08.464 --> 01:45:11.365
<i>Mary:
Lloyd? Lloyd!</i>

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.368
Huh?

01:45:13.402 --> 01:45:16.496
I said this is
my husband Bobby.

01:45:16.538 --> 01:45:19.530
- Oh. Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

01:45:19.575 --> 01:45:24.069
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

01:45:24.112 --> 01:45:26.945
Thank you both
very much.

01:45:26.982 --> 01:45:30.577
I owe you both
a debt of gratitude.

01:45:30.619 --> 01:45:32.382
Thank you.

01:45:51.473 --> 01:45:53.941
I can't believe
this, Lloyd.

01:45:53.976 --> 01:45:55.876
First Mary dumps us,

01:45:55.911 --> 01:45:57.845
then the cops take
our nest egg.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.973
- Then our hog breaks down.
- Yeah!

01:46:00.015 --> 01:46:03.143
When are we ever
gonna catch a break?

01:46:04.953 --> 01:46:07.478
<i># Hallelujah #</i>

01:46:07.523 --> 01:46:09.616

<i># Hallelujah. #</i>

01:46:16.698 --> 01:46:20.634
- Hi, y'all.
- (speaking foreign language)

01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:22.830
Hi, guys! We're going
on a national bikini tour,

01:46:22.871 --> 01:46:24.600
and we're looking for
two oil boys

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.006
who can grease us up
before each competition.

01:46:31.213 --> 01:46:33.738
You are in luck!

01:46:33.782 --> 01:46:37.047
There's a town about
three miles that way.

01:46:37.085 --> 01:46:39.349
I'm sure you'll find
a couple guys there.

01:46:42.090 --> 01:46:44.615
Okay. Thanks.

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.753
Bye!

01:46:53.869 --> 01:46:56.497
Do you realize
what you've done?

01:46:56.538 --> 01:47:00.167
- Hey!
- Lloyd!

01:47:00.208 --> 01:47:02.870
Lloyd!

01:47:10.586 --> 01:47:12.884
You'll have to
excuse my friend.

01:47:12.921 --> 01:47:15.890
He's a little slow.

01:47:15.924 --> 01:47:19.018
<i>The town is
back that way.</i>

01:47:28.670 --> 01:47:30.194
Wow.

01:47:30.238 --> 01:47:32.138
Two lucky guys

01:47:32.174 --> 01:47:34.267
are gonna be driving around
with those girls

01:47:34.309 --> 01:47:36.174
for the next
couple of months.

01:47:36.211 --> 01:47:38.873
Yeah, don't worry.

01:47:38.914 --> 01:47:40.745
We'll catch
our break too.

01:47:40.782 --> 01:47:44.274
- Just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Yeah.

01:47:44.319 --> 01:47:45.752

You're it.
Quitsies.

01:47:51.727 --> 01:47:53.695
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
double-stamp.

01:47:53.729 --> 01:47:56.254
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
triple-stamp.

01:47:56.298 --> 01:47:58.289
- No erasies, none at all.
- You can't triple-stamp.

01:47:58.333 --> 01:48:00.563
Yes, if you have a double-stamp,
of course you can.

01:48:00.602 --> 01:48:02.160
- You can't triple-stamp!
- # La la la la la... #

01:48:02.204 --> 01:48:04.172
You can't if you
have a double-stamp!

01:48:04.206 --> 01:48:05.969
You can't triple-stamp...
the rule!

01:48:06.008 --> 01:48:09.967
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

01:48:10.012 --> 01:48:12.845
Lloyd! Lloyd!
