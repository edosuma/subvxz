00:00.546 --> 00:03.546
(film reel running)

00:08.222 --> 00:10.972
(rhythmic music)

00:20.055 --> 00:22.638
(mellow music)

01:00.730 --> 01:02.915
(chains rattling)
(Lily cheering)

01:02.915 --> 01:03.881
(men applauding)

01:03.881 --> 01:04.714
- Nice shot.
- That was hot.

01:04.714 --> 01:05.714
- Foot fall.

01:07.083 --> 01:10.680
- No, no, that was a perfect shot.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.470
- Sorry, foot was over the line.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.570
- Guys are saying, no, listen to the guys.

01:15.460 --> 01:16.970
Vote, can we take a vote?

01:16.970 --> 01:18.190
- Are we playing by the rules or not?

01:18.190 --> 01:19.480
Come on.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.580
That birdie flew away.

01:22.270 --> 01:23.103
- Such bullshit.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.160
- [Shane] Hey.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.530
- Shane, my boy, how are you?

01:33.530 --> 01:34.363
Have a seat.

01:35.290 --> 01:36.340
Please, sit down.

01:37.213 --> 01:38.140
(Robert screaming)

01:38.140 --> 01:41.083
Not there, that is a
Herman Miller original.

01:42.020 --> 01:43.450
Please.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.320
I'm gonna have to teach
you about these antiques

01:45.320 --> 01:48.850
if you're going to be
posting them on my internets.

01:48.850 --> 01:50.920
Sit in the knock off.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.140
- Sorry.
- Yes.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.930
That's worth about a thousand
bucks, this is 60 bucks.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.170
You'll learn, my boy,
you'll learn, my boy.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.525
And you'll get paid, you'll get paid.

01:59.525 --> 02:00.358
- Okay.
- You'll get paid.

02:00.358 --> 02:02.980
(Robert patting Shane's leg)

02:02.980 --> 02:05.618
- You know he's not from England, right?

02:05.618 --> 02:08.140
- (laughing) Whoa, ladybug.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.900
That is true, I'm not proper British,

02:10.900 --> 02:12.650
but most of my friends are Brits,

02:12.650 --> 02:15.450
and I've spent quite a few fortnights

02:15.450 --> 02:17.263
across the pond, as they say.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.363
- [Shane] Interesting.

02:19.370 --> 02:22.350
- I guess the dialect
has rubbed off on me,

02:22.350 --> 02:24.890
some of the affectations.

02:24.890 --> 02:27.980
So, yes, I am Yankee by blood, but

02:29.770 --> 02:31.363
British by.

02:36.943 --> 02:38.973
- (sighing) Okay,

02:40.810 --> 02:43.220
Dad, this has, this has got to,

02:43.220 --> 02:44.790
Shane, do you think that I
could just talk to my dad

02:44.790 --> 02:46.490
really quick, just privately?

02:46.490 --> 02:47.323
- [Shane] Yeah.

02:56.930 --> 02:57.763
- Dad?
- You know what?

02:57.763 --> 02:58.596
Just stop.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.513
I get it.

03:02.170 --> 03:03.250
I'm acting a little crazy.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.250
I feel crazy.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.770
I'm having what they call, a

03:10.510 --> 03:13.410
mid-life crisis, okay?

03:13.410 --> 03:15.410
But I don't have the
money to buy a Corvette

03:15.410 --> 03:16.710
or a boat or a motorcycle

03:16.710 --> 03:20.820
or whatever the fuck
50 year olds buy or do

03:20.820 --> 03:22.010
when they turn 50,

03:22.010 --> 03:23.650
which is halfway to a hundred.

03:23.650 --> 03:26.170
That's mid-life, if I
live to be a hundred.

03:26.170 --> 03:29.720
You're gonna be lucky if I
don't live to be a hundred.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.010
This is what I'm doing, okay?

03:32.010 --> 03:34.150
This is my mid-life crisis.

03:34.150 --> 03:35.320
Let me have a little fun.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.640
I'm having fun with Shane.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.640
- I just wanted to borrow 20 bucks.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.310
- For what?

03:44.310 --> 03:45.970
- A disc golf tournament.

03:45.970 --> 03:47.570
- You know what, there's a saying,

03:47.570 --> 03:52.397
when you're a child you
play with children's toys,

03:53.680 --> 03:56.720
but as you grow up you must put.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.630
No, hang on a minute.

03:57.630 --> 04:01.090
It goes, children play,
when you're a child

04:01.090 --> 04:03.900
your toys are okay,

04:03.900 --> 04:07.360
but as you grow up you've
got to put the toys away.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.610
I think it actually rhymes like that.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.780
In a trunk or something like that.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.750
Basically, what I'm trying
to say is grow the fuck up.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.060
And please just get a real job.

04:16.060 --> 04:16.893
- Thank you.

04:16.893 --> 04:18.024
- Don't walk out on me, bye-bye.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.607
(upbeat music)

04:31.102 --> 04:34.019
(Nona kissin coin)

04:37.516 --> 04:40.933
(coin scratching ticket)

04:48.106 --> 04:51.740
(rocks crashing)
(Nona screaming)

04:51.740 --> 04:53.293
- God.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.211
What did I do to their
beautiful rock garden?

04:57.211 --> 05:00.794
(rocks hitting each other)

05:17.771 --> 05:22.771
(rocks crashing)
(Nona sighing)

05:25.106 --> 05:27.773
(Nona knocking)

05:29.987 --> 05:31.789
(Robert knocking)

05:31.789 --> 05:33.115
- Hello?
(Robert knocking)

05:33.115 --> 05:38.115
Hello.
(both knocking)

05:39.040 --> 05:39.873
- Hello?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.201
- Yeah.
- Hello?

05:41.201 --> 05:42.990
- How can I help you?

05:42.990 --> 05:43.823
- Is Lily here?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.563
- She's probably asleep, but,

05:50.810 --> 05:53.100
you're her friend, yeah,

05:53.100 --> 05:54.870
from high school, Nina.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.283
- Nona.

05:56.283 --> 05:57.620
- No, it's not Nina?

05:57.620 --> 05:58.640
- Nona.
- No.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.260
- Sure.
- Yeah, she's asleep,

06:00.260 --> 06:01.363
so why don't you come back in a couple.

06:01.363 --> 06:02.830
- Lily!
Lily.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.680
- She's sleeping.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.740
- Well, she can wake up.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.150
- Sleeping.
- Nona.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.070
Come in here.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.264
- Hey, Lily, Lily!

06:09.264 --> 06:11.694
(Nona knocking)
Lily!

06:11.694 --> 06:13.014
- Nona!
- Hey!

06:13.014 --> 06:14.924
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my gosh!

06:14.924 --> 06:15.822
- Come in.
I'm sorry.

06:15.822 --> 06:16.655
- Just get in here.
(Nona mumbling)

06:16.655 --> 06:17.488
Just come on in.

06:17.488 --> 06:18.321
- I dropped out.

06:18.321 --> 06:19.576
- I know, I can't believe it.

06:19.576 --> 06:20.409
- We gotta party.

06:20.409 --> 06:22.330
I am home forever.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.280
- Hang on a minute.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.100
Did you say you dropped out of college?

06:26.100 --> 06:26.933
- Yeah.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.330
Yeah.
- Well guess what?

06:29.330 --> 06:30.463
Lily never went.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.080
- Neither did you.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.617
- Okay, that's neither here nor there.

06:34.617 --> 06:35.970
Are you guys hungry?

06:35.970 --> 06:36.803
- Yeah.
- Can I get you anything?

06:36.803 --> 06:39.150
- Yeah.
- So I've been writing poems.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.323
- Hey, real quick.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.053
How's your mom?

06:44.820 --> 06:46.370
- She's crazy.

06:46.370 --> 06:51.310
- Yeah, crazy like a foxy lady.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.120
She's such a bitch and that's what I love.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.280
You know, men love bitches

06:54.280 --> 06:57.130
and that's why you're gonna
get a lot of men little lady.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.660
- So, I got this.
Boom.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.510
- You're still scratching?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.380
- Yeah, but this is a winner.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.213
This is a winner.

07:06.213 --> 07:07.080
- How much did you win?

07:07.080 --> 07:09.340
- 10 dollars right here.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.180
A boat.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.350
- Let's bring people.

07:11.350 --> 07:12.183
- Okay.

07:12.183 --> 07:17.183
We get some guy models to
serve us, and cook for us.

07:17.350 --> 07:19.080
- [Lily] Or robot models.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.433
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.140
Got ya some breakfast.
- Yes, yummy!

07:23.140 --> 07:26.380
- I have a lot to do today, so have at it.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.213
- I'm so glad to be home.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.060
- [Robert] I'll be at the shop.

07:28.060 --> 07:29.520
- It was sad and lonely.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.660
I hated it.
It's great.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.440
(egg cracking and liquid dripping)

07:32.440 --> 07:34.150
It's great to see you.

07:34.150 --> 07:36.050
- [Robert] FYI, you have to cook the eggs.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.243
- What the fuck?

07:38.177 --> 07:41.400
- 38 pairs of shoes.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.213
Write that down, 38 pairs.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.270
We got an angel here.

07:47.270 --> 07:48.670
Angel.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.193
Seven pounds.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.580
I mean dollars. (laughing)

07:53.580 --> 07:54.608
- Right.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.910
- I thought I was in England for a minute.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.833
Brandy glass.
(glass tinking)

07:59.833 --> 08:01.559
(glass tinking)
That thing.

08:01.559 --> 08:03.250
(glass clinking)
A vase.

08:04.729 --> 08:06.030
(glass crashing)

08:06.030 --> 08:09.930
Now, this is a family heirloom.

08:09.930 --> 08:13.260
My great-great-grandmother, 1899.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.260
- [Shane] Looks old.

08:15.349 --> 08:16.543
It's a lamp, right?

08:18.260 --> 08:19.600
- Yes,

08:19.600 --> 08:22.790
and she had it in her parlor.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.623
- [Shane] It's pretty.

08:23.623 --> 08:25.219
- She lived in Manchester.

08:25.219 --> 08:26.961
(lamp clinking)

08:26.961 --> 08:29.060
Christ all mighty.

08:32.068 --> 08:34.818
(Robert gasping)

08:40.070 --> 08:40.960
- [Nona] Hi Mom.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.853
- Hi Sweetie.

08:43.900 --> 08:44.733
No.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.210
- But Mom.

08:46.210 --> 08:49.530
- This little hoodlum has
been out stealing recycling,

08:49.530 --> 08:52.170
and she stole my plastic, and my glass.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.250
- I'm sorry, I'll go.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.960
- [Sonya] I don't want you
hanging out with this hoodlum.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.310
- Actually, we were gonna
go play golf anyways.

09:01.050 --> 09:03.634
- Oh, I understand how it is.

09:03.634 --> 09:04.467
Oh, I get it.

09:04.467 --> 09:07.690
You think that it's okay for you to leave.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.320
I'm not staying up all night,

09:09.320 --> 09:11.260
and I'm not gonna play
chess with you later.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.730
Don't even ask me!

09:12.730 --> 09:14.719
And tell your goddamn father, Lily,

09:14.719 --> 09:16.098
to stop yelling!

09:16.098 --> 09:17.015
He's crazy!

09:18.918 --> 09:20.629
(door slamming)

09:20.629 --> 09:23.462
(bottle spraying)

09:24.907 --> 09:26.790
(Sonya breathing heavily)

09:26.790 --> 09:28.690
- I just say have at it.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.503
- Yeah, but what happened
to your pool guy?

09:34.870 --> 09:39.870
- It's not in me budget, quite right now.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.070
So why don't you start at the deep end

09:42.070 --> 09:44.500
and work your way towards the.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.440
You can see it's like a swamp.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.450
It's been weeks.

09:47.450 --> 09:49.323
- You wanted me to clean the whole thing?

09:52.022 --> 09:52.855
(water splashing)

09:52.855 --> 09:54.420
- Wait, what's that?

09:54.420 --> 09:55.640
The bottom of the pool.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.548
- [Shane] What's what?

09:56.548 --> 09:58.590
- At the bottom.

09:58.590 --> 10:02.063
Oh my god, there's a dead lizard
at the bottom of the pool.

10:03.110 --> 10:04.160
- No, I can't get it.

10:05.810 --> 10:06.643
It's too deep.

10:06.643 --> 10:08.520
- You're gonna have to jump in.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.400
- With my clothes on?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.980
- Yeah, it's gonna rot in my whole pool.

10:11.980 --> 10:13.353
Just take your clothes off.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.373
- Okay, do you have a bathing suit?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.310
- No, it won't fit you.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.933
You've got a fat ass.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.860
- It's not that fat.

10:22.860 --> 10:23.693
- Just get in there.

10:23.693 --> 10:25.042
Take your clothes off and get in.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.248
Honestly, I'm gonna have to drain the pool

10:27.248 --> 10:28.913
if that thing rots any further.

10:30.515 --> 10:31.640
(Shane sighing)

10:31.640 --> 10:32.913
Get in there.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.823
What, does he think he can swim?

10:37.210 --> 10:38.393
He's like, oh, look,

10:40.330 --> 10:42.980
a big, body of water.

10:42.980 --> 10:46.233
I'm one of those lizards that
can run across the water,

10:47.280 --> 10:48.350
and then where is he now?

10:48.350 --> 10:49.773
On the bottom of the pool.

10:50.610 --> 10:53.743
Chip, chop, bottom of pool, pronto.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.553
Get down there.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.410
Get to the bottom of the pool.

10:59.410 --> 11:02.380
Bottom of the pool, bottom of the pool,

11:02.380 --> 11:05.900
bottom of the pool, bottom of the pool.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.373
What are you waiting for boy?

11:09.310 --> 11:12.825
(Shane splashing)

11:12.825 --> 11:15.658
(Shane screaming)

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
- I got your lizard,

11:19.920 --> 11:21.320
from the bottom of the pool.

11:22.660 --> 11:23.493
(Shane sighing)

11:23.493 --> 11:26.076
(sultry music)

11:30.928 --> 11:32.812
(Lily grunting)

11:32.812 --> 11:35.716
(Lily kissing arm)

11:35.716 --> 11:38.383
(Nona grunting)

11:46.406 --> 11:48.807
(Lily kissing arm)

11:48.807 --> 11:51.743
(chains rattling)

11:51.743 --> 11:53.345
- [Nona] Oh, yeah!

11:53.345 --> 11:55.101
(Lily laughing)

11:55.101 --> 11:57.550
(Nona screaming)

11:57.550 --> 11:58.461
(chains rattling)

11:58.461 --> 12:00.128
- Come on, let's go.

12:02.685 --> 12:03.545
Come on.

12:03.545 --> 12:06.128
(Nona sighing)

12:16.679 --> 12:18.615
- Can we get some scratchers?

12:18.615 --> 12:19.792
(Nona screaming)
(rock hitting tree)

12:19.792 --> 12:21.723
(both cheering)

12:21.723 --> 12:22.556
- Hey!

12:24.027 --> 12:24.903
Excuse me.

12:26.394 --> 12:27.227
What are you doing?

12:27.227 --> 12:29.003
Show some respect to nature, okay.

12:30.238 --> 12:33.310
(Ted hammering)

12:33.310 --> 12:35.850
- You're hammering a nail in a tree.

12:35.850 --> 12:37.330
That's disrespecting nature.

12:37.330 --> 12:38.410
- This is where we put our mail.

12:38.410 --> 12:40.270
I got like eight more to put up.

12:40.270 --> 12:42.050
I don't have time to explain to you

12:42.050 --> 12:43.160
how this community works

12:43.160 --> 12:44.930
that you're clearly not a part of.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.430
- I don't want to be a
part of your community.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.450
- Yeah, well the feeling's mutual.

12:48.450 --> 12:49.283
- Is it?

12:49.283 --> 12:51.107
- Yeah, my community is
the greatest community.

12:51.107 --> 12:52.470
- These trees are the
only friends you have.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.840
You have no other friends but trees,

12:53.840 --> 12:54.707
that's why you probably (mumbling).

12:54.707 --> 12:57.630
- I don't need any other
friends, all right.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.160
I got my friend right here.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.993
Say hello to my little friend here.

13:00.993 --> 13:02.144
(Nona yelling)

13:02.144 --> 13:03.160
I can't.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.660
Just go.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.590
I got messages to spread.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.360
We're a community.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.220
- [Lily] We have to enter that.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.820
500 dollars, that's like.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.890
- A week and a half of lottery tickets.

13:14.890 --> 13:15.723
Think of the money.

13:15.723 --> 13:18.002
Like 500 dollars, we could turn that into

13:18.002 --> 13:19.620
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

13:19.620 --> 13:20.907
We're entering this, yeah.

13:20.907 --> 13:23.083
- But it's 50 dollars to enter.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.120
That's a lot.

13:25.120 --> 13:25.953
- Yeah.

13:27.050 --> 13:27.883
- I feel like.

13:29.096 --> 13:30.180
We could do that,

13:30.180 --> 13:33.450
but it's just one person, 50 dollars.

13:33.450 --> 13:34.283
- Yeah.

13:34.283 --> 13:36.883
- Yeah, we probably know who should enter.

13:38.305 --> 13:40.630
- I mean, I would like to.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.630
Like, I've gotten a lot better,

13:42.630 --> 13:43.727
and I think I could really bring it,

13:43.727 --> 13:45.473
and I could really do a great job.

13:46.720 --> 13:47.553
- You could bring it.

13:47.553 --> 13:48.386
- Yeah.

13:48.386 --> 13:49.219
- You could bring my bag.

13:50.135 --> 13:50.990
You could bring my bag.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.520
- Like carry your bag?

13:52.520 --> 13:54.443
- Like be my caddy.

13:54.443 --> 13:56.111
Do you want to be my caddy?

13:56.111 --> 13:57.177
- Yeah.

13:57.177 --> 13:59.549
(upbeat music)

13:59.549 --> 14:02.216
(doors opening)

14:05.212 --> 14:08.667
(Robert falling and grunting)

14:08.667 --> 14:11.500
(Robert exhaling)

14:25.253 --> 14:27.836
(can rattling)

14:36.303 --> 14:39.720
(Robert clearing throat)

14:44.452 --> 14:47.285
(Robert spitting)

14:52.462 --> 14:55.211
(Lily groaning)

14:55.211 --> 14:56.347
(Robert clearing throat)

14:56.347 --> 15:00.264
(Robert playing slide whistle)

15:04.308 --> 15:07.725
(Frisbee hitting Robert)

15:09.924 --> 15:10.757
- Sorry.

15:15.518 --> 15:17.268
- Oh, where were you?

15:18.816 --> 15:20.520
- I was.
- I know.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.383
- [Both] Golfing.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.363
- How?

15:23.363 --> 15:24.960
- Well that's all you do.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.013
But that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:28.809 --> 15:30.410
How'd that contest go?

15:30.410 --> 15:33.253
The light break, nighttime contest?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.434
- I lost.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.370
- (smirking) Did you?

15:38.370 --> 15:41.400
So that's another 20
bucks down the shitter.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.243
Oh, this came for you.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.133
Sorry.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.860
- Dear Tenant, please leave.

15:49.860 --> 15:50.930
I love you.

15:50.930 --> 15:52.440
The MGM.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.880
- It's an eviction notice, okay.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.540
You're being evicted and
I'd like you to evict ASAP.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.490
- Okay, Dad.
- Which means

15:57.490 --> 15:58.750
as soon as possible.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.900
- I don't have time for this, okay.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.880
I'm cold.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.170
- Hey, hey, hey, hang on a minute.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.623
You always avoid this topic.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.830
There's never any time,

16:06.830 --> 16:08.710
and I wanna discuss this now,

16:08.710 --> 16:10.690
because I could rent your room out,

16:10.690 --> 16:13.900
and I need to because I'm not doing well.

16:13.900 --> 16:14.937
Okay, you're 17 years old.

16:14.937 --> 16:16.120
- I'm 20 years old.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.620
- Okay, that's worse.

16:17.620 --> 16:21.120
You know, I ran away when I was 16.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.750
Just a little, faggoty kid,

16:22.750 --> 16:24.180
running down the streets of Chicago,

16:24.180 --> 16:25.160
and I had nowhere to go.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.010
I know you have a place to go.

16:27.010 --> 16:27.843
Don't you?

16:27.843 --> 16:28.980
- No.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.480
- Well, listen.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.313
Listen to me,

16:32.420 --> 16:36.910
I would be doing you a
disservice if I let you stay here

16:36.910 --> 16:40.970
for free, and suck on my milkless teat

16:40.970 --> 16:42.530
for the rest of your life.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.190
You're doing nothing,

16:44.190 --> 16:45.680
nothing with your life.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.460
You don't have a job.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.610
- You don't have a job.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.861
- You watch your mouth, little lady.

16:51.861 --> 16:54.270
I'll wash it out with Ivory soap.

16:54.270 --> 16:58.100
Okay, I run an antiquities exchange.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.470
- You run a junk shop.

17:00.470 --> 17:03.460
- For the last time,
it is an antique store,

17:03.460 --> 17:05.750
and I know it's not doing well.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.760
That's why I need you to, you know,

17:07.760 --> 17:08.880
stay with one of your friends,

17:08.880 --> 17:10.970
just maybe just for a couple months,

17:10.970 --> 17:13.790
up to a couple, forever hopefully.

17:13.790 --> 17:15.910
It's called leaving the nest.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.660
I should just push you out
and see if you can fly.

17:18.660 --> 17:19.493
I need to
(banging on door)

17:19.493 --> 17:21.390
rent this room out.

17:21.390 --> 17:22.223
- Okay.

17:22.223 --> 17:23.830
- [Robert] You're not doing anything

17:23.830 --> 17:24.710
with your life.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.950
- Yes I am.

17:25.950 --> 17:29.270
I'm going to be a
professional disc golfer.

17:29.270 --> 17:33.740
- There's no such thing as
a professional disc golfer!

17:33.740 --> 17:34.600
- Okay, I'm out.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.433
I'll move out.

17:35.433 --> 17:38.280
- Hey, hey, hang on a
minute, hang on a minute.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.060
You do have a place to go, yeah?

17:40.060 --> 17:40.893
- Yeah.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.633
- Okay, because I'm not a devil.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.090
- Yeah you are, but whatever.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.160
- No, hang on a minute.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.117
I'm sorry I yelled.

17:47.117 --> 17:48.343
I'm sorry, but listen.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.330
This is gonna be good, this is gonna good.

17:53.013 --> 17:55.374
It's gonna be very good for you.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.944
(door opening)

17:56.944 --> 17:59.861
(suitcase rolling)

18:06.850 --> 18:09.320
- Hey, I just came
through your front door.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.153
It's unlocked.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.025
Lily's room good to go?

18:13.025 --> 18:15.608
(mellow music)

18:18.810 --> 18:21.100
- I'm going to take a quick potty break,

18:21.100 --> 18:21.933
and I'll be.

18:24.608 --> 18:26.634
(door closing)

18:26.634 --> 18:29.338
- [Announcer] Can we get a
manager to register five, please?

18:29.338 --> 18:31.024
A manager to the front.

18:31.024 --> 18:33.607
(upbeat music)

18:37.694 --> 18:40.444
(motor whirring)

19:05.182 --> 19:07.295
- Where's the key to this drawer?

19:07.295 --> 19:09.073
'Cause I can't get it.

19:09.073 --> 19:10.296
- I don't know.

19:10.296 --> 19:11.564
(can tapping on door)

19:11.564 --> 19:14.960
- Mr. Markles is here.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.096
(bell ringing)

19:16.096 --> 19:17.866
Mr. Markles.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.012
(cane tapping floor)

19:20.012 --> 19:21.228
No.
- Here, let me get that.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.742
(both mumbling)

19:23.742 --> 19:24.825
- You go get.

19:26.413 --> 19:28.319
Stop, Mr. Markles.

19:28.319 --> 19:29.750
Mr. Markles,
(glass clattering)

19:29.750 --> 19:31.659
no, have a seat.

19:31.659 --> 19:32.648
Hi, no, what.

19:32.648 --> 19:36.757
(boxes falling)
(glass clattering)

19:36.757 --> 19:37.590
Help me.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.900
It's just a little glassware.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.570
- Excuse me.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.290
Jimmy Choo shoes?

19:44.290 --> 19:45.123
- Sit here.

19:45.123 --> 19:45.956
- [Customer] Jimmy Choo!

19:45.956 --> 19:46.961
- Coming, coming, coming.

19:46.961 --> 19:47.794
Coming.

19:48.909 --> 19:49.884
No, there's are not.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.970
No, those are Tom Ford.

19:51.970 --> 19:54.313
Oh, no, those are Tom Ford.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.250
Mr. Markles!

19:58.250 --> 19:59.083
No, Shane!

19:59.921 --> 20:01.105
(glass clattering)
Mr. Markles!

20:01.105 --> 20:01.938
Shane!

20:03.255 --> 20:05.601
(screaming) Mr. Markles.

20:05.601 --> 20:06.934
No, Mr. Markles!

20:08.778 --> 20:10.538
Help me, Shane!

20:10.538 --> 20:12.987
(glass shattering)

20:12.987 --> 20:14.340
Mr. Markles!

20:14.340 --> 20:17.730
Help me!

20:17.730 --> 20:19.252
- [Customer] Jimmy Choo shoes.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.085
- Coming, coming.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.350
- Shoes!
- Coming, coming.

20:22.350 --> 20:25.100
(dramatic music)

20:27.667 --> 20:29.290
- Did you get any money?

20:29.290 --> 20:30.330
- I got 10 dollars.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.563
- All right, all right.

20:32.563 --> 20:34.520
40 more to go.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.970
- We're gonna invest it, man.

20:35.970 --> 20:40.123
We're gonna take that 10
dollars, get a scratcher, boom.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.320
- Wait, what?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.493
- Set for life.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.423
Set for life.

20:48.222 --> 20:49.690
(register beeping)
- Thank you.

20:49.690 --> 20:50.650
Gotta win this one.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.540
I'm gonna win it.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.373
Yeah!

20:52.373 --> 20:53.206
- Well, scratch it.

20:53.206 --> 20:54.923
- You don't scratch it.

20:57.098 --> 20:57.931
You gotta be in it.

20:57.931 --> 20:58.830
- What do you mean?

20:58.830 --> 21:00.413
- You gotta be in the zone.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.320
(coin scratching ticket)

21:04.320 --> 21:05.163
Oh, shit.

21:06.186 --> 21:07.019
- Did we win?

21:07.019 --> 21:07.852
- Yeah, yeah.

21:07.852 --> 21:08.685
- We won?
- Yeah.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.610
- How much?

21:09.610 --> 21:10.850
- We won another one.

21:10.850 --> 21:14.580
Yeah, we won another one.

21:14.580 --> 21:15.900
- Should've just gotten your money back.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.578
All right, just scratch it.

21:17.578 --> 21:20.240
(knuckles cracking)

21:20.240 --> 21:21.690
- I feel like you're glaring.

21:22.820 --> 21:23.653
You're glaring.

21:25.348 --> 21:27.890
(sighing) They can't all be winners, okay.

21:27.890 --> 21:28.910
- Did you at least win another one?

21:28.910 --> 21:30.767
- No, but we'll get another one.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.585
(Lily sighing)

21:39.120 --> 21:41.330
- Lose like 20 dollars every day.

21:41.330 --> 21:42.603
It's not just today.

21:43.550 --> 21:44.383
- No.

21:44.383 --> 21:45.816
- Yes.

21:45.816 --> 21:47.210
- No.

21:47.210 --> 21:48.350
No.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.820
But it's still playing the odds.

21:50.820 --> 21:51.750
You know,

21:51.750 --> 21:53.090
like you still gotta,
- Oh my god.

21:53.090 --> 21:54.240
- I won that free ticket.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.480
- Oh my god, seriously,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.200
you literally sound insane,

21:57.200 --> 21:58.680
and I'm not about to just

21:58.680 --> 21:59.609
waste my life,
- Well, you know what?

21:59.609 --> 22:02.700
- Trying to get you to get scratchers.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.730
- You kind of sound
like a bitch right now.

22:04.730 --> 22:05.563
- Okay, then I'm a bitch.
- Maybe your dad's right.

22:05.563 --> 22:06.740
Do you want 50 dollars?

22:06.740 --> 22:07.950
Or do you want 50000 dollars?

22:07.950 --> 22:10.907
- No, I don't care about
having 50000 dollars right now.

22:10.907 --> 22:12.040
- But you want 50 dollars.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.763
- I want to just take
a nap in my room, okay.

22:15.763 --> 22:16.730
- In your room?

22:16.730 --> 22:17.596
- Yes.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.960
- You have a place to sleep
because of me right now.

22:19.960 --> 22:20.831
- I know, and thank you.

22:20.831 --> 22:22.813
- (Hushing) My mom's asleep,
my mom's asleep, 'kay?

22:22.813 --> 22:23.646
(Lily snoring)

22:23.646 --> 22:25.060
You're not sleeping.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.413
You can't fall asleep that fast.

22:28.283 --> 22:29.116
Lily.

22:30.060 --> 22:32.507
I am your caddy, okay,

22:32.507 --> 22:35.320
and I am there, guiding you step by step,

22:35.320 --> 22:37.500
I am there telling you
which disc to throw,

22:37.500 --> 22:39.432
and how to throw it.

22:39.432 --> 22:42.220
And I am there every step of the way,

22:42.220 --> 22:43.830
leading you to victory.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.900
And this is a victory
I'm trying to lead us to,

22:45.900 --> 22:47.210
but you're fucking it up.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.301
Lily.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.134
Lily.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.233
Lily.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.400
I'm gonna go get some pretzels.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.233
(Lily snoring)

22:54.233 --> 22:56.120
I'm gonna get some pretzels,

22:56.120 --> 22:57.630
and I'm gonna get a Set For Life,

22:57.630 --> 23:00.620
and I'm gonna bring home that money.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.339
Your dad's right, you're a bitch.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.600
(dog groaning)

23:04.600 --> 23:09.060
- Now, is it possible on the
website of the internets,

23:09.060 --> 23:12.420
to get sound, song?

23:12.420 --> 23:13.253
- Yeah.

23:13.253 --> 23:16.594
- Then can I compose something?

23:16.594 --> 23:18.297
- Yeah.
- Something like this?

23:18.297 --> 23:22.214
(Robert playing slide whistle)

23:29.344 --> 23:31.547
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

23:31.547 --> 23:32.750
- Are you laughing at me?

23:32.750 --> 23:33.828
- No, I think that's really good.

23:33.828 --> 23:34.777
- You're smiling.

23:34.777 --> 23:36.470
- I'm smiling 'cause it's really good.

23:36.470 --> 23:37.303
- Really?

23:37.303 --> 23:38.136
- Yeah.
(Robert cheering)

23:38.136 --> 23:38.969
It's really good.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.920
- Yes, I like this, I
like this, I like this

23:40.920 --> 23:41.753
so much.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.580
It's a little out of tune,
but I blame the whistle.

23:45.580 --> 23:46.960
It's a little bent.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.603
I'm a professional.

23:49.910 --> 23:52.933
You know, I really need
a metal slide whistle.

23:53.801 --> 23:56.681
These are just cheap, hard plastic.

23:56.681 --> 23:57.870
(whistle dropping)

23:57.870 --> 24:00.040
Show me the bells and whistles

24:00.040 --> 24:03.060
when you first see the main page.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.450
What are they gonna see?

24:04.450 --> 24:05.450
- How about we put you?

24:05.450 --> 24:06.900
- Oh, I like.
- Do you like that?

24:06.900 --> 24:07.733
- I like that.

24:07.733 --> 24:08.566
- All right, let's do that.

24:08.566 --> 24:09.399
We'll put you.

24:09.399 --> 24:10.232
- Oh, I like that a lot.

24:10.232 --> 24:11.065
Just my face.

24:11.065 --> 24:11.898
- And then we'll have you hold (mumbling).

24:11.898 --> 24:13.338
- Oh, I see, right.

24:13.338 --> 24:14.530
(mumbling) I like that.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.170
- We'll have you holding all your junk.

24:16.170 --> 24:17.060
- I love it.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.623
- We'll do one side.

24:20.623 --> 24:21.773
- Can you stop?

24:22.970 --> 24:24.660
They're antiques, they're antiquities,

24:24.660 --> 24:28.784
they're expensive, and they're very old.

24:28.784 --> 24:29.617
- Okay.

24:29.617 --> 24:32.240
- I don't want to hear you say junk again.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.430
Just because it's old
doesn't mean it's junk.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.963
- Okay, sorry.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.970
- Did you hear that?

24:39.970 --> 24:41.580
Did you hear that?

24:41.580 --> 24:45.240
Just because something's
old doesn't mean it's junk,

24:45.240 --> 24:46.073
something like that,

24:46.073 --> 24:47.490
like, for a slogan.

24:47.490 --> 24:48.460
- That's pretty good.
- Right.

24:48.460 --> 24:49.475
- Yeah, that's actually really good.

24:49.475 --> 24:50.870
- Right.
- Yeah, that's really good.

24:50.870 --> 24:51.927
- Right!

24:51.927 --> 24:55.540
I've been looking for a slogan for years!

24:55.540 --> 24:58.172
I've got to write this down.

24:58.172 --> 24:59.172
There we go.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.520
Something about junk.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.170
- Junk.
- You called it junk.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.020
- I did, but it wasn't.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.697
- Yeah, okay, don't bring your, no,

25:07.697 --> 25:10.800
it was something, what
was it, how did it start?

25:10.800 --> 25:11.633
- Just.

25:11.633 --> 25:14.263
- Right, right, right, I got it, I got it.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.096
Just,

25:18.662 --> 25:19.495
hang on.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.610
Just, all that's coming
to me is just junk,

25:27.610 --> 25:30.420
but that doesn't, that would be the worst.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.343
Just junk.

25:33.350 --> 25:34.440
(Robert sighing)

25:34.440 --> 25:35.393
We lost it.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.560
I just don't remember what it is.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.803
Just because it's junk
doesn't mean it's junk.

25:43.969 --> 25:47.970
What kind of flibbertgibbet,
flibbertigibbert idiot

25:49.060 --> 25:51.827
would come up with something like that?

25:53.473 --> 25:57.120
You're a real willow of the whisp,

25:57.120 --> 26:00.363
real mongoloid idiot.

26:01.358 --> 26:05.041
(paper ripping and crumpling)

26:05.041 --> 26:07.538
(dog whining)

26:07.538 --> 26:10.890
- Lettuce, peanut butter.

26:10.890 --> 26:11.803
Yes, Nona?

26:14.220 --> 26:15.740
- I have a thought.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.640
- Well keep that one up, that's a change.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.533
- I need 50 dollars.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.140
- You need to stop
thinking and start praying.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.710
You have got to stop the scratching.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.220
- I'm not scratching.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.370
- Then what?

26:32.370 --> 26:33.340
- Disc golf.

26:34.950 --> 26:35.783
Yeah.

26:36.890 --> 26:38.830
- So you're playing actual golf?

26:38.830 --> 26:40.140
- It's like golf, but

26:40.140 --> 26:41.700
it would use a Frisbee.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.590
- How do you hit a
Frisbee with a golf club?

26:44.590 --> 26:45.980
- You use a disc.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.320
There's no golf clubs.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.390
- How do you get the disc
into the little holes?

26:49.390 --> 26:50.620
- Instead of the little holes,

26:50.620 --> 26:55.620
there's these big, metal,
like chain, like baskets.

26:56.690 --> 26:59.398
There's a tournament this weekend,

26:59.398 --> 27:04.360
and we need 50 dollars
to play, to rock it.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.220
- We?

27:05.220 --> 27:06.420
- Yeah, Lily.

27:06.420 --> 27:07.253
- I'm out.

27:07.253 --> 27:08.542
- No, no.

27:08.542 --> 27:12.580
Mom, she can totally win this.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.413
Please?

27:13.413 --> 27:14.820
- Please what?

27:14.820 --> 27:17.090
That bitch is trouble.

27:17.090 --> 27:17.950
- Which bitch?

27:17.950 --> 27:20.320
- The which bitch behind me.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.920
- Lily is my best friend, Mom.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.440
I know she can win this.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.563
She is like a disc golf god.

27:30.090 --> 27:30.923
Please?

27:33.700 --> 27:34.684
- Fine.

27:34.684 --> 27:37.267
(upbeat music)

27:59.263 --> 28:01.432
- Lily, can you come here for a second?

28:01.432 --> 28:02.813
- Oh, yeah.

28:06.265 --> 28:07.098
What's up?

28:07.098 --> 28:09.523
- Yeah, could you just stop staring at me?

28:10.613 --> 28:12.573
It just makes me feel
uncomfortable, that's all.

28:14.033 --> 28:16.990
- I just wish that I
could just stare at you

28:16.990 --> 28:19.420
without feeling like a creep.

28:19.420 --> 28:22.440
Guys do it all the time, right,
and we don't say anything.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.390
No matter what we say

28:24.390 --> 28:26.590
you guys think that
we're flirting with you.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.503
- Yeah, I'd just prefer
if you didn't, that's all.

28:32.909 --> 28:36.865
- Well I'm gonna fuck you with my eyes.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.033
- Enjoy your session.

28:38.033 --> 28:38.880
- Yeah.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.895
- Have fun.

28:39.895 --> 28:42.478
(upbeat music)

28:54.704 --> 28:57.454
(dramatic music)

29:08.606 --> 29:09.439
(Nona yelling)

29:09.439 --> 29:12.356
(Lily kissing arm)

29:19.465 --> 29:22.382
(Lily kissing arm)

29:35.648 --> 29:38.737
(man mumbling)

29:38.737 --> 29:42.830
- All right, first place
today is Lily Fletcher.

29:42.830 --> 29:46.050
She's gonna be taking first place prize.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.480
Congratulations.
(all applauding)

29:47.480 --> 29:48.483
Great game.

29:52.430 --> 29:53.760
- Hey.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.710
Lily.

29:54.710 --> 29:55.543
Wait up.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.380
Hey, congratulations.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.640
- Thanks, yeah.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.040
- As you know, I work for Legacy,

30:02.040 --> 30:04.720
and we wanted you to come
by the shop sometime,

30:04.720 --> 30:05.923
pick up some gear on us.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.950
- Okay.

30:07.950 --> 30:11.320
- And I was curious, are
you serious about going pro?

30:11.320 --> 30:12.483
- Yes, yeah.

30:13.740 --> 30:17.183
- Well, we'd like to offer
you a full sponsorship.

30:19.960 --> 30:20.930
- Really?

30:20.930 --> 30:22.060
- Yeah.

30:22.060 --> 30:24.700
I mean you're extremely
talented young woman,

30:24.700 --> 30:27.140
and by representing Legacy Discs,

30:27.140 --> 30:27.973
it's gonna open up

30:27.973 --> 30:29.260
a ton of new opportunities
for you to shine.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.980
- Oh my god.

30:30.980 --> 30:32.532
I will not let you down.

30:32.532 --> 30:33.830
- What about me?

30:33.830 --> 30:34.710
- What?

30:34.710 --> 30:36.203
- Do I get sponsorship too?

30:37.840 --> 30:40.113
- We don't generally sponsor caddies.

30:41.763 --> 30:44.063
- Oh, well yeah, sorry.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.653
- I mean, I'm sorry, I can't then.

30:51.060 --> 30:53.669
- Well then, I guess
you're both sponsored.

30:53.669 --> 30:54.502
- [Lily] Really?

30:54.502 --> 30:55.335
- Yeah, I mean we'll have to.

30:55.335 --> 30:56.168
- Oh my god!
- Aw, sweet!

30:56.168 --> 30:57.190
Yeah, yeah.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.490
- Yeah, I'll have to
run it by my boss, but.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.691
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
run it by your boss.

31:00.691 --> 31:01.524
- Thanks.

31:01.524 --> 31:02.910
- Should be cool.

31:02.910 --> 31:04.449
Yeah, so, well you have my card.

31:04.449 --> 31:06.830
Come stop by anytime.

31:06.830 --> 31:07.740
Maybe later this week.

31:07.740 --> 31:08.737
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:08.737 --> 31:10.167
- Thanks.

31:10.167 --> 31:11.653
- Sooner than later, if you want.

31:11.653 --> 31:14.587
- Yeah, I hope it's sooner than later.

31:14.587 --> 31:15.995
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

31:15.995 --> 31:16.828
But, yeah.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.196
- But you just said sooner than later.

31:21.196 --> 31:23.210
- Oh yeah, don't put words in my mouth.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.040
- Okay, I'm not, but.
- See ya later.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.830
- Yeah, sooner than later.

31:26.830 --> 31:28.510
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

31:28.510 --> 31:30.060
- I think he likes me.
- Yeah.

31:35.836 --> 31:37.540
- Oh, look what I made.

31:37.540 --> 31:38.793
- Looks good.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.240
- Picked 'em right off the tree.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.990
- Oh, by the way, I wanted to tell you,

31:43.990 --> 31:45.940
The Antique Roadshow is coming to town.

31:48.950 --> 31:49.783
- Right.

31:52.027 --> 31:54.260
I know, I know.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.908
I'm going on.

31:55.908 --> 31:57.463
- I thought it was appointment only.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.280
- Oh no, I was planning
on calling them today,

32:01.280 --> 32:02.460
making that appointment,

32:02.460 --> 32:05.811
but it's fascinating we're on the same.

32:05.811 --> 32:07.358
That's good.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.203
You're thinking like me.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.273
That's exciting.

32:13.252 --> 32:17.169
(Robert playing slide whistle)

32:35.960 --> 32:37.623
Well, I think I'm gonna
pop into the philharmonic

32:37.623 --> 32:40.060
and see if they need a
slide whistler. (laughing)

32:40.060 --> 32:41.640
- [Shane] Oh really?

32:41.640 --> 32:44.284
That's so weird, 'cause
I got you something.

32:44.284 --> 32:45.451
- Oh, what is.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.770
What the fuck is this?

32:48.770 --> 32:49.603
- It's a kazoo.

32:49.603 --> 32:50.436
- I know.

32:52.497 --> 32:53.873
I know it's a kazoo.

32:55.089 --> 32:57.030
Why would you think I'd want that.

32:57.030 --> 33:00.910
- Because clowns like slide whistles,

33:00.910 --> 33:02.030
and clowns use kazoos.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.240
I thought you would like this.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.233
I thought that's something you would like.

33:07.062 --> 33:08.843
- I'm a clown?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.310
- No, I didn't say that.

33:11.310 --> 33:14.050
- You just said I'm a clown.

33:14.050 --> 33:16.480
You said, clowns like slide whistles,

33:16.480 --> 33:19.130
and you know I like slide whistles.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.130
So I'm a clown

33:20.130 --> 33:22.516
that's going to like
slide whistles and kazoos.

33:22.516 --> 33:23.450
- No, that's not what I said.

33:23.450 --> 33:24.374
I just said that, you know,

33:24.374 --> 33:26.350
that clowns they have to use those things.

33:26.350 --> 33:27.183
I didn't know.

33:27.183 --> 33:31.073
- First of all, clowns
don't use slide whistles.

33:32.410 --> 33:37.410
Slide whistles accompany
the clowns goofy actions

33:37.850 --> 33:39.763
and pratfalls and trips.

33:41.610 --> 33:44.370
They honk a horn maybe. (imitating horn)

33:44.370 --> 33:47.890
Now, I don't have any qualms
playing the slide whistle

33:47.890 --> 33:51.773
for a clown, in, let's
say Cirque du Soleil.

33:52.810 --> 33:57.810
It's a quite a very well
known and well paying gig.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.010
I've no problem with that.

34:00.010 --> 34:03.463
But I, meself, am not clown,

34:04.320 --> 34:07.910
with a rubber nose, running
around playing a slide.

34:07.910 --> 34:09.510
Clowns don't do that, git,

34:09.510 --> 34:14.510
please, try to understand there are clowns

34:16.430 --> 34:18.440
and there are musicians.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.610
- I thought it was a nice gesture.

34:19.610 --> 34:20.959
It's a kazoo.

34:20.959 --> 34:21.997
Who doesn't like kazoos.

34:21.997 --> 34:25.011
- Oh, right, you know
who doesn't like kazoos?

34:25.011 --> 34:26.710
(kazoo hitting floor)

34:26.710 --> 34:27.881
Me.

34:27.881 --> 34:30.600
(Lily gasping)

34:30.600 --> 34:31.840
- Legacy Disc.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.240
Bitch you're a legend.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.743
Right, come on, let's do this.

34:38.793 --> 34:41.523
(Lily knocking on door)

34:41.523 --> 34:44.106
(door opening)

34:45.218 --> 34:47.885
(phone ringing)

34:56.711 --> 34:59.711
(keyboard clicking)

35:08.800 --> 35:09.763
- [Both] Hi.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.530
- Yes, can I help you?

35:13.530 --> 35:14.750
- Is Matt here?

35:14.750 --> 35:15.673
- Max.
- Max here.

35:16.570 --> 35:17.540
Is Max here?

35:17.540 --> 35:18.723
Yeah, I don't know.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.030
- Could we call him?

35:23.030 --> 35:25.490
Or bring him forward?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.340
Or let him know that we're here?

35:27.340 --> 35:28.660
- I don't know, can you?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.173
- Does Max work here?

35:31.130 --> 35:32.600
- [Woman] I don't know.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.138
- Yeah, I'll be right back, yeah.

35:34.138 --> 35:35.971
- [Lily and Nona] Max!

35:38.596 --> 35:40.977
- Welcome to Legacy Discs.

35:40.977 --> 35:42.977
Make yourselves at home.

35:45.169 --> 35:46.419
Right, welcome.

35:49.169 --> 35:50.690
Yeah, so this is where we manufacture

35:50.690 --> 35:51.810
pretty much everything.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.070
You know, we got discs over here.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.048
We've got discs right here.

35:56.048 --> 35:58.527
We've got some more discs right here.

35:58.527 --> 35:59.810
It's where we get the work done, you know.

35:59.810 --> 36:02.190
Pretty much just got discs.

36:02.190 --> 36:03.560
Yeah, feel free to touch them.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.640
It's all right.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.057
(Lily and Nona giggling)

36:10.998 --> 36:12.946
- Oh, I wouldn't do that yet.

36:12.946 --> 36:16.700
Last week, we had Johnathon,
he put his finger in there,

36:16.700 --> 36:19.634
and now he's Nine Finger Johnny.

36:19.634 --> 36:22.301
(Lily laughing)

36:24.200 --> 36:25.370
I'm totally serious.

36:28.417 --> 36:30.167
- Nine Finger Johnny.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.003
Oh wait, I need to tie
my shoe really quick.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.125
(sultry music)

36:43.871 --> 36:44.704
- Ladies.

37:00.796 --> 37:04.129
(Nona and Lily moaning)

37:22.193 --> 37:23.163
- Dad, Dad.

37:24.278 --> 37:25.350
- Yeah.

37:25.350 --> 37:26.250
I'm over here.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.083
I'm in the lemons.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.030
- Oh, Dad, guess what?

37:29.030 --> 37:30.157
- What?

37:30.157 --> 37:31.193
- I got a sponsor.

37:32.610 --> 37:36.580
- Oh, I didn't know you had a problem.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.920
- I don't have a problem.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.140
- Was it alcohol?

37:40.140 --> 37:41.330
- What?

37:41.330 --> 37:43.733
- Oh my god, you're on drugs?

37:45.037 --> 37:46.970
You know what, you got a sponsor,

37:46.970 --> 37:48.140
you're ahead of the game.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.690
Look, my sponsor sucks.

37:49.690 --> 37:50.715
- No, I didn't get a.

37:50.715 --> 37:52.244
- He's in the hospital right now.

37:52.244 --> 37:53.720
- He is?

37:53.720 --> 37:57.280
- You know, pretty much,
I'm this close to drinking.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.580
- But you're not drinking.

38:00.140 --> 38:03.149
- I'm having a little nip
and tuck here and there.

38:03.149 --> 38:05.073
Maybe I could have your sponsor.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.256
- Well, no, I don't have
a sponsor like that.

38:07.256 --> 38:09.690
It's like, I have a
sponsor with my disc golf.

38:09.690 --> 38:12.490
It's Legacy, it's like the
biggest company in disc golfing.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.580
- Oh.

38:13.580 --> 38:14.413
- Yeah.

38:14.413 --> 38:18.040
- You have like a thing where
they pay you to play, finally.

38:18.040 --> 38:18.873
- Yeah, yeah.

38:18.873 --> 38:20.890
- So how much money did they pay you?

38:20.890 --> 38:21.723
- Well, they don't pay me,

38:21.723 --> 38:23.470
they just allow me to go into tournaments

38:23.470 --> 38:24.790
to be able to win money,

38:24.790 --> 38:26.550
and they give me like shirts and stuff.

38:26.550 --> 38:28.400
- Oh great, then you won't be naked.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.360
Guess what?

38:29.360 --> 38:32.070
I am sponsored in my slide whistle.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.000
- You got a new sponsor.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.650
- I got sponsored to
play the slide whistle,

38:36.650 --> 38:38.567
in with a bunch of clowns.

38:38.567 --> 38:41.700
And they gave me t-shirts and red noses.

38:41.700 --> 38:42.533
- Really?

38:42.533 --> 38:43.366
- Yeah.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.102
It's a good job, good job for you.

38:47.102 --> 38:50.300
- Dad, don't get mad,
this is a good thing.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.180
- It is good, but you know
what's gonna be better,

38:52.180 --> 38:54.110
when they start paying you money.

38:54.110 --> 38:55.999
But it is good.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.725
- [Lily] I'm going to be making money.

38:57.725 --> 38:59.468
- Good, good, good, good.

38:59.468 --> 39:02.827
I gotta keep moving or
I just lose my momentum.

39:03.877 --> 39:06.460
(mellow music)

39:09.219 --> 39:11.576
Did you get a couple lemons?

39:11.576 --> 39:13.807
- Yeah I did, I got.

39:13.807 --> 39:15.172
- I got plenty.

39:15.172 --> 39:16.005
- Yeah.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.550
- Just put that down there.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.650
I will never watch Antique Roadshow again,

39:40.650 --> 39:43.270
or any public television for that matter.

39:43.270 --> 39:44.853
They humiliated me.

39:45.770 --> 39:47.600
Absolutely.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.763
They shunned me.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.710
Used to be my favorite show.

39:53.710 --> 39:55.460
This is what I do.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.160
I deal in antiquities,

39:57.160 --> 39:59.663
and they just didn't appreciate them.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.580
That fella, Frederick, that we had,

40:03.580 --> 40:06.470
he's a millennial, he
just doesn't appreciate,

40:06.470 --> 40:07.920
he's an imbecile.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.673
Doesn't even know what an antique is.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.483
Totally humiliating.

40:17.720 --> 40:20.383
- All he said was just
bring more special things.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.240
- These are special things.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.940
- You brought your cell
phone from the eighties.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.320
Hello, hello, who's calling?

40:29.320 --> 40:30.153
Nobody.

40:30.153 --> 40:33.115
- You're being quite
disrespectful right now.

40:33.115 --> 40:34.510
- You bought this at Target.

40:34.510 --> 40:35.980
I was with you when you
bought this at Target.

40:35.980 --> 40:36.813
- Busted.

40:36.813 --> 40:38.660
I did try to pull one over on them.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.820
They almost thought

40:39.820 --> 40:43.560
this was actually Marilyn
Monroe's hat case.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.670
- A pasta strainer.

40:44.670 --> 40:46.010
- Well, it's my grandmother's.

40:46.010 --> 40:47.460
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

40:47.460 --> 40:48.530
You ever see that color?

40:48.530 --> 40:49.670
- Fucking hubcap.

40:49.670 --> 40:51.130
- No, that's a vase.

40:51.130 --> 40:52.310
- Jeep, Jeep?

40:52.310 --> 40:55.167
- Oh, I did not know Jeep made vases.

40:55.167 --> 40:57.030
- You brought a fucking bag of pennies.

40:57.030 --> 40:59.320
- Look, you can see that's
old, that's cracked.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.275
- This is shit.

41:00.275 --> 41:01.108
- Well don't.

41:01.108 --> 41:01.941
- No, this is junk!

41:03.372 --> 41:05.760
Junk, junk, junk, junk,
junk, junk, junk, junk, junk,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.561
fucking junk.

41:07.561 --> 41:10.610
Junk, that's what that
shit is, it's all junk.

41:10.610 --> 41:13.097
- Leave, you need to leave, get out.

41:14.967 --> 41:15.840
- It's your junk.

41:15.840 --> 41:20.780
- You are disrespectful and you're fired.

41:20.780 --> 41:21.613
- Good.

41:22.530 --> 41:23.363
Good.

41:24.330 --> 41:26.700
- Well, my website's done anyways.

41:31.881 --> 41:33.690
(door opening)

41:33.690 --> 41:34.810
- Hey, you wanted to see me?

41:34.810 --> 41:36.110
- Just strapped.

41:36.110 --> 41:38.160
Can I get the key back to the front door?

41:38.160 --> 41:39.910
- Is that why you wanted to see me?

41:41.290 --> 41:43.350
You don't want me to ever stop by?

41:43.350 --> 41:45.760
- I'll make a key, but I
just need it now, because.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.345
- I can make a copy.

41:47.345 --> 41:48.567
- I need it now.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.040
(keys rattling)

41:51.040 --> 41:52.327
Well which one is it?

41:53.510 --> 41:56.432
No, I know, 'cause mine's
right here, that's it.

41:56.432 --> 41:59.401
So, take this one off.

41:59.401 --> 42:04.172
Okay, that should be,
oh, this is the P.O. box.

42:04.172 --> 42:06.339
- My mail gets sent there.

42:07.622 --> 42:09.513
- What is that?

42:09.513 --> 42:11.500
It's the key to my gun.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.200
It's the trigger lock.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.320
Why do you have that?

42:15.320 --> 42:16.153
- I don't know.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.413
- Well, I'm taking that
with, what are all these?

42:22.527 --> 42:24.277
Hang on a minute, hang on a minute.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.840
What is this one?

42:26.840 --> 42:29.466
No, this one, this one,
this one I'll take.

42:29.466 --> 42:30.299
- All right, is that all?

42:30.299 --> 42:33.600
- No, no, no, no, this is the back door.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.159
Both of these, the sliding door.

42:36.159 --> 42:36.992
(key tinkling)

42:36.992 --> 42:37.933
Put that back on later.

42:39.460 --> 42:41.234
The gym membership.

42:41.234 --> 42:42.410
- [Lily] I need that.

42:42.410 --> 42:46.600
- I need it back, 'cause I
lent it to you like a year ago.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.944
- [Lily] You never go to the gym.

42:47.944 --> 42:49.660
- Well, I'm gonna start going to the gym.

42:49.660 --> 42:50.586
I need to.

42:50.586 --> 42:52.400
I don't feel the same.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.217
- You said that three years ago.

42:56.950 --> 43:01.950
- Definitely don't need
my IKEA family plan.

43:04.050 --> 43:05.623
Yes, we're still a family.

43:06.900 --> 43:09.260
'Cause I don't know what this last one is,

43:09.260 --> 43:11.730
but I'm sure it's not for you.

43:11.730 --> 43:16.730
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
figure out what they're for,

43:16.810 --> 43:20.793
and do you need this?

43:22.350 --> 43:23.610
'Cause I could really use it.

43:23.610 --> 43:25.223
I got a lot of keys now.

43:27.330 --> 43:28.374
- Yeah, I need that.

43:28.374 --> 43:32.331
(coin scratching ticket)

43:32.331 --> 43:33.849
- What are you doing in there, honey?

43:33.849 --> 43:35.062
- [Nona] I'm taking a piss.

43:35.062 --> 43:36.237
(coin scratching ticket)

43:36.237 --> 43:37.880
- You're not taking a piss.

43:37.880 --> 43:38.713
I hear you.

43:38.713 --> 43:39.999
I hear that.

43:39.999 --> 43:40.902
- Fine.

43:40.902 --> 43:44.097
- (mumbling) Get out of the bathroom.

43:45.124 --> 43:47.890
- I'm fine, okay, please leave me alone.

43:47.890 --> 43:48.923
Just give me a second.

43:48.923 --> 43:50.133
- [Sonya] You've been scratching.

43:50.133 --> 43:52.362
- Mom, don't touch me,
it's fine, it's nothing.

43:52.362 --> 43:54.553
- (crying) Oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god.

43:54.553 --> 43:56.970
- You're so overdramatic, this is nothing.

43:56.970 --> 43:58.879
You're making this all
about you, and it's nothing.

43:58.879 --> 44:01.031
(Sonya crying)

44:01.031 --> 44:03.954
Mom, it's nothing, okay, I'm fine.

44:03.954 --> 44:04.787
Will you stop!

44:04.787 --> 44:05.690
You're making this all about you,

44:05.690 --> 44:06.692
and it's not about you!

44:06.692 --> 44:07.525
- Get your stuff out, out.

44:07.525 --> 44:08.362
You don't live here anymore.

44:08.362 --> 44:09.760
- What?
- You don't live here.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.450
- I am gonna leave, 'cause
I'm sick of your bullshit.

44:12.450 --> 44:14.210
- You're ruining my serenity.

44:14.210 --> 44:16.380
- Oh, and you're serenity's
more important than I am.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.450
Yeah, so make me homeless
for your serenity.

44:18.450 --> 44:19.876
Fuck that!

44:19.876 --> 44:22.820
(door slamming)

44:22.820 --> 44:25.320
(dog whining)

44:26.335 --> 44:27.300
- Hey!

44:27.300 --> 44:28.363
- What are you doing?

44:28.363 --> 44:30.670
- Hey, I got a trip planned for us.

44:30.670 --> 44:31.910
We're going on a trip.

44:31.910 --> 44:32.743
- We are?

44:32.743 --> 44:33.627
- Yeah, yeah, I packed your bag.

44:33.627 --> 44:34.758
We're ready.
- Where?

44:34.758 --> 44:36.060
- We're going camping.

44:36.060 --> 44:36.893
- We are?

44:36.893 --> 44:37.789
- Yeah, we are.

44:37.789 --> 44:38.725
- I love camping.

44:38.725 --> 44:40.058
- I know you do.

44:41.339 --> 44:42.630
(garage door slamming shut)

44:42.630 --> 44:43.463
- [Lily] Sorry.

44:43.463 --> 44:44.296
- Just be a little quiet.

44:44.296 --> 44:45.129
- [Lily] Sorry.

44:45.129 --> 44:46.920
- The cooler's in the back, let's just go.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.120
Whoa, look at this, look at this.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.100
Boom, boom, boom.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.170
Look at you go.

44:50.170 --> 44:51.320
You got it, you got it.

44:52.625 --> 44:54.744
- Just like that.
- Be real quiet, real quiet.

44:54.744 --> 44:55.577
- Just like that.

44:55.577 --> 44:56.823
- All right, you ready for me?

45:00.214 --> 45:01.514
I'm coming over.

45:01.514 --> 45:02.514
Here I come.

45:03.456 --> 45:04.789
Okay, all right.

45:06.788 --> 45:11.020
Okay, I'm coming over.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.456
I really don't know how
to get over on this.

45:13.456 --> 45:14.856
I don't know how to do this.

45:18.750 --> 45:19.667
Okay, okay.

45:21.072 --> 45:24.239
(garbage can banging)

45:26.814 --> 45:27.731
Okay, okay.

45:29.910 --> 45:32.040
Okay, I got this, you ready?

45:32.040 --> 45:33.489
Catch me.

45:33.489 --> 45:35.308
You might need to catch me.

45:35.308 --> 45:36.783
We're doing it.

45:37.646 --> 45:38.850
Okay.

45:38.850 --> 45:40.020
Whoa, okay, my foot is in the.

45:40.020 --> 45:41.693
You ready to catch me?

45:42.560 --> 45:43.393
All right,

45:45.228 --> 45:46.061
- [Lily] Bring it over.

45:46.061 --> 45:46.894
- Oh my tits.

45:46.894 --> 45:47.939
- Let go, let go, let go.

45:47.939 --> 45:48.939
You're good.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.830
What's going on?

45:51.830 --> 45:55.401
- I got us both kicked out,
so let's set up our tent.

45:55.401 --> 45:56.916
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

45:56.916 --> 45:59.416
(goofy music)

46:08.396 --> 46:11.063
- [Lily] You made a tent before?

46:17.910 --> 46:19.993
That does not look right.

46:20.999 --> 46:23.582
(upbeat music)

46:48.851 --> 46:50.779
(footsteps falling)

46:50.779 --> 46:53.529
(fabric ripping)

46:57.002 --> 47:00.335
(Lily knocking on door)

47:03.167 --> 47:04.483
- What's going on?

47:06.600 --> 47:08.450
You're getting rid of the pool table?

47:10.710 --> 47:11.630
- Well, I'm gonna sell it.

47:11.630 --> 47:13.460
I'm just moving it down to the store,

47:13.460 --> 47:15.623
so I can sell it.

47:16.705 --> 47:18.840
- But you love pool.

47:18.840 --> 47:19.673
- Nah.

47:20.780 --> 47:21.613
You like that?

47:21.613 --> 47:23.203
Using your millennial phrase, nah.

47:25.060 --> 47:26.720
- Naw.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.550
- Oh, it's naw.

47:29.550 --> 47:30.383
- Naw.

47:30.383 --> 47:32.023
- I thought it was nah.

47:32.023 --> 47:32.856
Nah.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.713
- No.

47:36.830 --> 47:37.800
- Doesn't really matter.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.270
- Well I just came to grab
some of my food that I left.

47:41.270 --> 47:43.610
- Yeah, just don't take
any of my food, okay.

47:43.610 --> 47:44.443
Especially the eggs.

47:44.443 --> 47:46.600
I know you love your eggs.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.620
- Okay.

47:47.620 --> 47:49.490
- Oh god, do you guys need help?

47:49.490 --> 47:51.573
Here let me get the door.

47:53.230 --> 47:54.140
- Thank you.

47:54.140 --> 47:54.973
- Yeah.

48:04.730 --> 48:05.750
- Thanks.

48:05.750 --> 48:06.583
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

48:06.583 --> 48:07.416
- Let me check, let me check.

48:07.416 --> 48:08.637
- There's only three.

48:08.637 --> 48:09.747
- Can I check?

48:09.747 --> 48:12.920
(mellow music)

48:12.920 --> 48:13.763
I said two.

48:15.730 --> 48:16.573
Lily.

48:25.412 --> 48:27.995
(upbeat music)

48:38.057 --> 48:40.724
(man screaming)

48:45.023 --> 48:47.606
(man exhaling)

48:53.575 --> 48:54.823
(Lily mumbling)
- Where's the basket?

48:56.765 --> 48:57.963
(man laughing)

48:57.963 --> 49:00.279
- There you go.

49:00.279 --> 49:01.112
I dare ya.

49:01.112 --> 49:03.695
(man mumbling)

49:04.975 --> 49:08.400
(Frisbee hitting face)
(Lily gasping)

49:08.400 --> 49:09.420
- I'm so sorry.

49:09.420 --> 49:10.253
- Are you okay?

49:11.138 --> 49:12.190
Where'd that come from?

49:12.190 --> 49:14.134
What the fuck?
- Are you okay?

49:14.134 --> 49:15.024
- Holy shit.

49:15.024 --> 49:20.024
(upbeat music)
(people yelling)

49:20.290 --> 49:23.568
(Lily groaning)

49:23.568 --> 49:26.985
(Lily and woman yelling)

49:27.873 --> 49:29.369
- It's okay, it's okay.

49:29.369 --> 49:31.405
- Whoa, whoa.
- Sorry, sorry.

49:31.405 --> 49:32.452
- Disc golf.

49:32.452 --> 49:35.110
(all yelling)

49:35.110 --> 49:36.100
- Water break?

49:36.100 --> 49:36.977
- Yeah, water.
- Water's a good time.

49:36.977 --> 49:40.150
(men mumbling)

49:40.150 --> 49:42.140
- [Nona] Your nose is bleeding again.

49:42.140 --> 49:43.220
- [Lily] It is?

49:43.220 --> 49:48.220
- Yeah, it's bleeding.

49:48.220 --> 49:49.793
The other one, the other.

49:52.900 --> 49:55.140
- Were you the one kicking me?

49:55.140 --> 49:59.283
- No, I kicked you a couple
times, but I wasn't kicking you.

50:01.870 --> 50:05.290
- Kicking me a couple times is kicking me.

50:05.290 --> 50:06.123
- No, I.

50:06.123 --> 50:07.040
- I thought we were friends.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.450
You were supposed to have my back.

50:08.450 --> 50:09.443
- We are friends.

50:09.443 --> 50:11.000
- Obviously not.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.280
- No, I had your back.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.960
I just had to watch out for mine too.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.330
It's like mob mentality.

50:15.330 --> 50:16.650
- They weren't attacking you.

50:16.650 --> 50:17.483
- Exactly.

50:17.483 --> 50:20.410
But if I didn't kick you
once or twice, gently,

50:20.410 --> 50:22.350
they would have come after me.

50:22.350 --> 50:24.461
- My rib hurts from that.

50:24.461 --> 50:26.794
(sad music)

50:28.998 --> 50:32.165
(Robert slurping tea)

50:42.707 --> 50:45.422
(Robert screaming)

50:45.422 --> 50:46.460
- I'm sorry.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.410
I've been here for like 15 minutes.

50:48.410 --> 50:51.560
- Welcome to my antiquities shopping.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.523
How can I help you?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.670
- So, I'm looking to return this.

50:56.670 --> 50:57.503
- Keep looking.

50:58.430 --> 51:00.380
'Cause where did you buy it?

51:00.380 --> 51:01.330
- I bought it here.

51:03.638 --> 51:04.985
- No.

51:04.985 --> 51:05.818
There's no way.

51:05.818 --> 51:06.793
We don't sell junk.

51:08.710 --> 51:10.070
- No, I did, I did.

51:10.070 --> 51:10.920
I have a receipt.

51:11.780 --> 51:15.320
- Okay, well I have a policy.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.383
Which is, change,

51:20.022 --> 51:21.022
if the plan,

51:23.543 --> 51:24.376
who?

51:26.268 --> 51:27.230
- Can I please just?

51:27.230 --> 51:31.313
- Oh, if you can dreamt
it, you can do it, do it.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.423
I need to.

51:38.423 --> 51:40.850
- I don't care at all.

51:40.850 --> 51:42.790
I want to give you back this elephant,

51:42.790 --> 51:44.087
because I don't want it.

51:44.087 --> 51:45.593
- Can you read this?

51:46.940 --> 51:49.003
- Your hand's covering
it, so absolutely not.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.600
- No, my hand is helping you read.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.767
No exchanges, no intercambios.

52:01.768 --> 52:04.570
(Robert attempting to
read foreign language)

52:04.570 --> 52:06.012
Oh.

52:06.012 --> 52:06.845
Do you speak Spanish?

52:06.845 --> 52:08.130
- I don't speak Spanish.

52:08.130 --> 52:08.963
- [Robert] You don't?

52:08.963 --> 52:09.796
- I don't speak Spanish.

52:09.796 --> 52:10.880
- Well, I do,

52:10.880 --> 52:13.160
and what that says is, go to Hell,

52:13.160 --> 52:17.550
because you bought it, you
broke it, you paid for it.

52:17.550 --> 52:19.700
You break it, you buy it.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.130
There it is, that's the
one I was looking for.

52:22.130 --> 52:23.810
You break it, you buy it.

52:23.810 --> 52:25.680
- It's not broken.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.925
It's completely fine.

52:26.925 --> 52:27.758
- Oh really?

52:27.758 --> 52:28.591
- [Man] Yes, really.
- Can I see it then?

52:28.591 --> 52:29.780
- [Man] Yes, you can see it.

52:29.780 --> 52:30.850
There's nothing wrong with it.

52:30.850 --> 52:32.105
No imperfections whatsoever.

52:32.105 --> 52:34.090
(elephant hitting floor)

52:34.090 --> 52:34.923
What are you?

52:34.923 --> 52:36.310
- Oh, I dropped it.

52:36.310 --> 52:37.864
You're right, it's not broken.

52:37.864 --> 52:40.133
(Elephant breaking)
Whoops.

52:40.133 --> 52:42.083
You broke it.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.780
You bought it, piggly wiggly.

52:45.780 --> 52:46.683
Thanks for coming.

52:48.167 --> 52:49.796
Bye.

52:49.796 --> 52:52.963
(Robert slurping tea)

52:55.821 --> 52:58.404
(bell ringing)

53:04.615 --> 53:07.198
(bell ringing)

53:08.520 --> 53:09.353
Hey.

53:10.650 --> 53:11.483
- Hi.

53:11.483 --> 53:13.120
- Welcome to my antiquities shopping.

53:13.120 --> 53:13.953
- Thank you.

53:16.052 --> 53:18.000
- What are you doing?

53:18.000 --> 53:21.860
- I'm just looking for a bracelet
or necklace for my fiance.

53:21.860 --> 53:25.460
- Yeah, I'll unlock this.

53:25.460 --> 53:27.033
- It looks like it's unlocked.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.687
(Robert imitating door lock)

53:33.687 --> 53:36.467
- See anything you liked?

53:38.120 --> 53:38.953
- Yeah.

53:41.054 --> 53:41.887
- Don't.

53:43.501 --> 53:46.334
(Robert mumbling)

53:51.590 --> 53:53.340
- Can I get all these for a dollar?

53:54.710 --> 53:55.543
- Yes.

54:01.106 --> 54:01.939
(bell ringing)

54:01.939 --> 54:02.890
Wait a minute, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

54:02.890 --> 54:04.548
No, no, no, no!

54:04.548 --> 54:06.073
Fuck!
Dammit.

54:10.586 --> 54:13.169
(bell ringing)

54:15.802 --> 54:17.170
(Robert screaming)

54:17.170 --> 54:18.600
Hello.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.880
Welcome to my antiquities shopping.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.347
- Yeah, great.

54:23.347 --> 54:24.180
- Ow.

54:26.230 --> 54:27.823
Dammit, who put this desk here?

54:28.790 --> 54:30.685
Fuck with me.

54:30.685 --> 54:31.910
What's this?

54:31.910 --> 54:33.520
- Well you left it in my car.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.730
It's been sitting in there for months.

54:34.730 --> 54:35.800
- What?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.750
- Yeah, you left your junk in my car.

54:37.750 --> 54:39.423
I mean antiquities.

54:39.423 --> 54:42.173
(Robert gasping)

54:45.518 --> 54:47.554
(Robert kissing finger)
(Robert mumbling)

54:47.554 --> 54:49.290
- [Robert] Oh there she is.

54:49.290 --> 54:50.740
- Yeah, it was sitting
in my trunk for months.

54:50.740 --> 54:52.736
So, I, you know, wanted to stop by.

54:52.736 --> 54:54.430
- I love you,

54:54.430 --> 54:55.540
this, this much.

54:56.507 --> 54:59.923
I love you, this, this much.

55:03.293 --> 55:06.853
(items clattering)

55:06.853 --> 55:09.630
You're late for work.

55:09.630 --> 55:11.323
- I quit a while ago.

55:12.731 --> 55:13.810
- [Robert] Oh.

55:13.810 --> 55:14.643
- You know this.

55:14.643 --> 55:16.083
I quit, I was in your house.

55:17.760 --> 55:18.593
- Oh.

55:19.670 --> 55:21.900
- Okay, well good seeing ya.

55:21.900 --> 55:23.632
- Oh, it's great seeing you.

55:23.632 --> 55:25.160
I'm from England.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.430
- [Shane] Is that right?

55:26.430 --> 55:27.263
- Right.

55:27.263 --> 55:29.020
- Well, you lost the
accent when you woke up.

55:29.020 --> 55:33.732
- Sometimes when I wake up my accent,

55:33.732 --> 55:35.800
you know, I actually can't,

55:35.800 --> 55:36.780
you know what, fuck you!

55:36.780 --> 55:39.710
I'm not from England, you fucking asshole.

55:39.710 --> 55:40.543
Fuck you.

55:40.543 --> 55:41.376
How 'bout this?

55:41.376 --> 55:43.138
Why don't you go across the pond?

55:43.138 --> 55:43.971
- Thanks for being a good boss.

55:43.971 --> 55:45.816
Appreciate it, thanks.

55:45.816 --> 55:48.399
(bell ringing)

55:52.261 --> 55:55.094
(engine starting)

55:56.329 --> 55:59.079
(Robert sighing)

56:00.339 --> 56:03.510
(Lily clearing throat)

56:03.510 --> 56:04.343
- Dad?

56:05.540 --> 56:06.373
Dad?

56:07.380 --> 56:08.261
Dad?

56:08.261 --> 56:09.660
- (groaning) Hi.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.860
Welcome to my antiquities shopping.

56:11.860 --> 56:13.560
- I haven't been here for a while.

56:15.066 --> 56:17.300
You got more junk, stuff.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.133
- Excuse me?

56:19.680 --> 56:20.810
Antiquities.

56:20.810 --> 56:21.700
- Yeah, yeah.

56:21.700 --> 56:23.552
- If you're coming here to bitch me out.

56:23.552 --> 56:25.110
- I just wanted to see,

56:25.110 --> 56:26.530
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

56:26.530 --> 56:28.000
- I'm great.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.200
- Are you sleeping here?

56:30.890 --> 56:31.943
- Is that a problem?

56:32.940 --> 56:34.093
Sometimes I fall asleep.

56:34.093 --> 56:35.423
- Like on purpose?

56:38.387 --> 56:41.353
- Does anybody fall asleep on purpose?

56:42.590 --> 56:43.423
- Yeah, I like to.

56:43.423 --> 56:45.708
- Okay, what can I do you for?

56:45.708 --> 56:47.392
I'm in the middle.

56:47.392 --> 56:49.360
(register beeping)

56:49.360 --> 56:52.034
- I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

56:52.034 --> 56:52.867
That's all.

56:52.867 --> 56:54.550
- I'm great.

56:54.550 --> 56:56.230
- I also wanted to tell
you thank you a lot for,

56:56.230 --> 56:58.650
you know, giving me
that push that I needed

56:58.650 --> 56:59.762
for getting me out.

56:59.762 --> 57:03.012
(Robert slow clapping)

57:10.370 --> 57:11.973
- Can I give you another push?

57:12.970 --> 57:14.771
Get out of my life.

57:14.771 --> 57:15.880
Get out.

57:15.880 --> 57:17.713
You never appreciated.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.020
- I love you, Dad.

57:20.020 --> 57:20.853
- Love you too.

57:21.903 --> 57:22.883
Bitch.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.440
(mellow music)

57:32.353 --> 57:33.186
(Nona cracking knuckles)

57:33.186 --> 57:35.230
- Have you seen one of my discs?

57:35.230 --> 57:36.063
The (mumbling) one?

57:36.063 --> 57:36.896
- No.

57:38.549 --> 57:43.490
(Nona blowing on coin)
(Nona kissing coin)

57:43.490 --> 57:44.323
- Wait, how'd you get scratchers?

57:44.323 --> 57:46.220
I thought you didn't have any money.

57:46.220 --> 57:48.320
- I found some money around the house.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.070
Like, not in the house,
but like, around it.

57:50.070 --> 57:51.610
You know, I didn't go in.

57:51.610 --> 57:56.281
- I'm so pissed, that disc was 20 dollars.

57:56.281 --> 57:57.170
- 20 dollars?

57:57.170 --> 57:58.569
- [Lily] Yeah.

57:58.569 --> 58:01.236
(Nona exhaling)

58:04.290 --> 58:06.225
- God, I got seven for it.

58:06.225 --> 58:07.058
- What?

58:07.058 --> 58:07.891
- [Nona] Just one.

58:07.891 --> 58:08.724
- You sold my disc?

58:08.724 --> 58:09.700
- Yeah, just the one, just the one.

58:09.700 --> 58:11.473
- That was my favorite disc.

58:12.663 --> 58:15.300
- Well, the blue one
can now be your favorite

58:15.300 --> 58:16.450
- How much did you get?

58:18.694 --> 58:20.930
- I got seven dollars.

58:20.930 --> 58:21.816
- You got seven dollars?

58:21.816 --> 58:22.787
- Yeah, yeah, seven dollars.

58:22.787 --> 58:24.520
- For my favorite disc?

58:24.520 --> 58:25.353
- But I got.

58:25.353 --> 58:26.186
- That's worth 20 dollars.

58:26.186 --> 58:27.470
- But I got tickets, and that's gonna.

58:27.470 --> 58:28.303
- Oh my god.

58:28.303 --> 58:30.150
- Scratchers are gonna multiply.

58:30.150 --> 58:30.983
So it's actually more than that.

58:30.983 --> 58:31.816
- You have a problem.

58:31.816 --> 58:32.863
- You have a problem.

58:32.863 --> 58:34.930
- No, you have a fucking problem,

58:34.930 --> 58:36.270
and now this is affecting me.

58:36.270 --> 58:38.510
- You know what your problem is?

58:38.510 --> 58:41.890
You're staying here, you
don't even have a house.

58:41.890 --> 58:43.830
You're staying here in my tent,

58:43.830 --> 58:45.860
and not even, like paying rent.

58:45.860 --> 58:46.850
It's the least you could do.

58:46.850 --> 58:48.070
- You're not paying rent.

58:48.070 --> 58:49.180
And I'm in a fucking tent.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.059
I could live with my dad in a tent.

58:51.059 --> 58:53.580
- No, 'cause he kicked you out.

58:53.580 --> 58:55.190
- So now you're gonna
kick me out of this tent?

58:55.190 --> 58:56.023
- Yeah, maybe I will.

58:56.023 --> 58:57.614
You know what, maybe I will.

58:57.614 --> 58:59.274
(Lily and Nona yelling)

58:59.274 --> 59:01.857
(upbeat music)

59:15.706 --> 59:17.390
- [Nona] You're tickling me.

59:17.390 --> 59:19.739
Stop, you're tickling me.

59:19.739 --> 59:24.739
(Lily and Nona laughing)
(dog barking)

59:28.547 --> 59:29.453
- Did you win?

59:31.993 --> 59:33.253
- I won another ticket.

59:34.940 --> 59:36.490
- You really do have a problem.

59:41.219 --> 59:44.400
(dog snoring)

59:44.400 --> 59:48.710
- Mom, I've been doing a lot of thinking,

59:48.710 --> 59:51.063
and I've decided,

59:56.010 --> 59:56.843
I'm done.

59:57.851 --> 59:59.018
- You're done?

1:00:00.265 --> 1:00:01.098
You're done?

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:02.265
- [Nona] Yeah.

1:00:04.010 --> 1:00:05.073
- You're done?

1:00:05.073 --> 1:00:06.240
- [Nona] Yeah.

1:00:07.652 --> 1:00:09.268
- Oh, honey, I love you.

1:00:09.268 --> 1:00:11.485
- I love you, Mom.

1:00:11.485 --> 1:00:12.977
I'm so proud of you.

1:00:12.977 --> 1:00:14.323
I'm so proud of you.

1:00:15.350 --> 1:00:17.403
Can we watch the cutlery channel now?

1:00:19.150 --> 1:00:20.020
- Sure.

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:20.853
Okay.

1:00:29.150 --> 1:00:30.650
- That one is beautiful,

1:00:30.650 --> 1:00:31.603
and did you see the pink one?

1:00:31.603 --> 1:00:33.910
- Mom, you have three of those.

1:00:33.910 --> 1:00:34.743
Mom.

1:00:34.743 --> 1:00:35.980
- I don't have the pink one,

1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:37.860
and they're on sale.

1:00:37.860 --> 1:00:41.490
- This may not be the
right time to say this, but

1:00:42.420 --> 1:00:44.470
I think you might have a problem.

1:00:44.470 --> 1:00:45.303
- I don't have a problem.

1:00:45.303 --> 1:00:47.172
(Lily knocking on door)

1:00:47.172 --> 1:00:48.005
- Dad?

1:00:59.383 --> 1:01:02.133
(rhythmic music)

1:01:29.031 --> 1:01:32.673
(Frisbee tinking on hole)

1:01:32.673 --> 1:01:35.506
(chains rattling)

1:01:38.073 --> 1:01:40.740
(Lily grunting)

1:01:47.013 --> 1:01:50.811
(chains rattling)
(men cheering)

1:01:50.811 --> 1:01:53.644
(chains rattling)

1:02:15.110 --> 1:02:16.243
- Lily!

1:02:16.243 --> 1:02:17.120
What's going on?

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.390
You're playing like shit.

1:02:19.390 --> 1:02:22.330
I need your mind right here, right now.

1:02:22.330 --> 1:02:24.080
- Yeah, I don't know.

1:02:25.529 --> 1:02:28.660
I just haven't heard or
seen my dad in a few weeks.

1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:29.569
- Wow, okay.

1:02:29.569 --> 1:02:31.900
Let's just be here.

1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:34.270
Let's focus on being here,

1:02:34.270 --> 1:02:37.860
and your dad's not in your control.

1:02:37.860 --> 1:02:39.560
He's not in his control.

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:40.393
He's not in control.

1:02:40.393 --> 1:02:42.350
So let's just focus.

1:02:42.350 --> 1:02:44.480
You have trained for
this, this is your moment.

1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:45.520
But I need you to get in there,

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.407
and do what you were born to do.

1:02:47.407 --> 1:02:49.695
I need you to slay those chains.

1:02:49.695 --> 1:02:52.278
(upbeat music)

1:03:04.144 --> 1:03:09.144
(chains rattling)
(people cheering)

1:03:30.284 --> 1:03:33.701
(Nona and Lily cheering)

1:03:43.075 --> 1:03:43.908
- Dad?

1:03:47.314 --> 1:03:48.294
Dad?

1:03:48.294 --> 1:03:50.129
- [Robert] (grunting) Yeah.

1:03:50.129 --> 1:03:51.153
- [Lily] Are you here?

1:03:51.153 --> 1:03:51.986
(Robert grunting)
Dad?

1:03:51.986 --> 1:03:52.819
- Hello?

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:56.130
- What are you doing?

1:03:57.470 --> 1:03:58.303
Dad.

1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:02.403
Your pants are undone.

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:05.163
- I was peeing.

1:04:08.150 --> 1:04:09.623
But probably masturbating.

1:04:11.540 --> 1:04:16.120
You know, they say that a glass of wine,

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:18.420
one glass of wine a day
is good for the heart.

1:04:19.850 --> 1:04:21.150
- [Lily] But four bottles?

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:24.713
- Even better.

1:04:29.033 --> 1:04:31.350
(Robert exhaling)

1:04:31.350 --> 1:04:32.200
Where's my phone?

1:04:34.407 --> 1:04:35.870
Do you have my phone?

1:04:35.870 --> 1:04:37.120
Nobody's calling anyways.

1:04:39.832 --> 1:04:41.468
I need to like, clean up.

1:04:41.468 --> 1:04:43.592
- Well, I just came by
to give you a present,

1:04:43.592 --> 1:04:45.680
because I thought you were,

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:46.730
it's a slide whistle.

1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:59.223
- This thing costs 50 bucks.

1:05:01.580 --> 1:05:02.683
Is it in there?

1:05:03.928 --> 1:05:05.583
Oh my god.

1:05:05.583 --> 1:05:09.753
(Robert blowing in whistle)

1:05:09.753 --> 1:05:10.753
Like butter.

1:05:13.073 --> 1:05:15.410
(Lily laughing)

1:05:15.410 --> 1:05:16.720
How did you make the money?

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:17.670
- [Lily] Disc golf.

1:05:19.190 --> 1:05:20.023
- Really?

1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:25.453
It's just been extremely hard for me.

1:05:26.354 --> 1:05:28.313
Probably I'm taking it out on you.

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:31.963
And I shouldn't be.

1:05:33.690 --> 1:05:37.320
And I would very much appreciate it

1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:39.030
if you moved back in here.

1:05:43.070 --> 1:05:44.570
- I think I'm fine in my tent.

1:05:45.696 --> 1:05:47.960
(Lily laughing)

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.730
No, dude, of course I
want to come back here.

1:05:50.730 --> 1:05:53.036
I hate that fucking tent.

1:05:53.036 --> 1:05:54.593
- I'm hurrying.

1:05:54.593 --> 1:05:57.740
(Robert exhaling)

1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:00.150
I'll clear this out, and you know,

1:06:00.150 --> 1:06:01.583
Nino can move in too if

1:06:01.583 --> 1:06:03.670
- Really?
- You're a lesbian lover

1:06:03.670 --> 1:06:04.640
with her and all that.

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.790
I'm totally, I'm very open.

1:06:06.790 --> 1:06:09.433
I was born in 1965, okay, so,

1:06:09.433 --> 1:06:11.940
free love is what I'm all about.

1:06:11.940 --> 1:06:15.490
So if you and Nino need to
be shacking up in your room

1:06:15.490 --> 1:06:17.050
I'm totally fine with that.

1:06:17.050 --> 1:06:19.217
I just need a rest.
- Okay.

1:06:20.949 --> 1:06:22.352
Love you.

1:06:22.352 --> 1:06:24.852
- Can you tell Sonya, what up?

1:06:26.421 --> 1:06:27.254
(door closing)

1:06:27.254 --> 1:06:29.837
(upbeat music)
