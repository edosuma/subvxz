WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:02.835
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:02.836 --> 00:04.870
You are about to see
at home.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.039
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:07.041 --> 00:12.277
On this turbocharged
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:12.846 --> 00:18.183
...The whole team feels the need
for speed in an Indy Car Special.

00:18.185 --> 00:18.951
Holy crap!

00:18.953 --> 00:23.222
First up, it's
a sporting-superstar showdown...

00:23.224 --> 00:24.390
Show you how we do it
in the olympics.

00:24.392 --> 00:29.361
...In a short-course sprint
that'll knock your socks off.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.562
Go!

00:30.564 --> 00:32.064
Can man beat car?

00:32.066 --> 00:32.664
That was close.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.035
Then, there's
some sensational suction...

00:36.037 --> 00:37.436
Whoa!
Look at that.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.672
...As the guys see
if a road-hugging race car

00:40.674 --> 00:43.442
Really can mobilize
a manhole cover.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.544
You're getting faster.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.311
Beautiful.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.882
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory,
and Grant strip down...

00:49.884 --> 00:52.751
Apparently, my intestines
are measuring 101 degrees.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.153
...Then suit up.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.156
I'm about to drive an IndyCar
for three hours! Whoo-hoo!

00:57.158 --> 01:00.592
...To test out
a race-day, weight-loss myth...

01:00.594 --> 01:02.761
goodness gracious, that's fast.

01:02.763 --> 01:07.099
...That pushes them
all to the brink and beyond.

01:07.101 --> 01:12.237
I am exhausted.
I feel like I just got beat up.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.508
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:17.177 --> 01:18.844
Adam Savage...

01:18.846 --> 01:20.245
It's scientific!

01:20.247 --> 01:22.014
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.215
Quack, damn you.

01:23.217 --> 01:28.120
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.689
Together with Kari Byron...

01:30.691 --> 01:32.057
Golden dragon!

01:32.059 --> 01:33.125
...Tory Belleci...

01:33.127 --> 01:34.593
Why are we doing this?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.794
...And Grant Imahara.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.229
Somebody order an explosion?

01:37.231 --> 01:39.898
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.100
Aw!

01:41.102 --> 01:43.235
They put them to the test.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.371

01:46.373 --> 01:50.342
Captions paid for by
discovery communications

01:50.344 --> 01:52.578
First out of the blocks
is a myth

01:52.580 --> 01:55.914
That pits hamstrings
against horsepower.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.990
What are you doing?

02:04.992 --> 02:05.691
Research.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.127
Only you could call playing
around with toys research.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.928
[ tires squeal ]
so, what's up first?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.430
First up,
we've got at doozy.

02:11.432 --> 02:16.368
There is a myth that a man can
actually outrun an IndyCar.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.169
I'm sorry.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.538
I don't know any dudes
that can run 220 miles an hour.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.241
He doesn't have to
because this race takes place

02:22.243 --> 02:25.711
Over only a distance
of 30 feet.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.045
Ah.
Well, that's different.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.881
That's all about the physics
of it --

02:28.883 --> 02:31.116
Traction, mass,
that kind of thing.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.284
That might just work.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.652
You feel like running?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.987
Maybe after lunch.

02:34.989 --> 02:35.787
Good idea.

02:36.891 --> 02:41.026
The incredibly Indy 500 is
renowned for its rolling starts.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.862
One reason
for this "go, go, go" game plan

02:43.864 --> 02:48.467
Is that IndyCars struggle to get
a grip from a standing start.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.069
But is their traction
really so terrible

02:51.071 --> 02:54.740
That in a 30-foot,
man-versus-car race-off,

02:54.742 --> 02:58.143
It's the human who'd take
the checkered flag?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.712
Well,
what better place to test it

03:00.714 --> 03:04.216
Than america's mecca
of motorsports?

03:04.218 --> 03:05.150
We've been lucky enough,

03:05.152 --> 03:06.752
In the course
of doing this show,

03:06.754 --> 03:08.887
To film
at some pretty iconic locations.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.324
We got to escape from alcatraz.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.458
Welcome to the rock.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.494
We got to throw pennies
off the roof

03:15.496 --> 03:17.629
Of the empire state building.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.364
Wow.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.300
And we looked for jimmy hoffa

03:21.302 --> 03:23.902
On the 50-yard line
of the meadowlands.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.006
But today, today, I am standing
on the starting line

03:28.008 --> 03:30.842
Of the most famous track
in racing,

03:30.844 --> 03:31.910
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway,

03:31.912 --> 03:35.414
Known, because of this strip I'm
standing on, as the brickyard.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.817
These bricks
are some of the 32 million

03:38.819 --> 03:43.021
Used to build the original,
2 1/2-mile-long track

03:43.023 --> 03:43.755
Back in 1909.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.125
The speedway's seen
speed records smashed

03:47.127 --> 03:51.196
And a lot of cars trashed
in its 100-year history.

03:51.198 --> 03:56.001
But safe to say it's never seen
anything quite like this.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.536
Well,
our track is all set up.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.804
You ready for some sprinting,
hoosier?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.740
I'm good to go. All we need
is a car and a drive.

04:01.742 --> 04:06.545
I'm not psychic, but I believe
one is showing up posthaste.

04:09.549 --> 04:10.682
Hey, everybody.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.117
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
Good.

04:12.119 --> 04:15.153
Ryan Briscoe's
a bit of a legend around here,

04:15.155 --> 04:18.055
Not just for his driving,
but for walking away

04:18.058 --> 04:21.660
From this calamitous crash
back in 2005.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.462
Today,
he's offered to coach Adam

04:23.464 --> 04:26.798
On how to get off
to a flying start.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.067
You've got
a lot of horsepower here,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.036
And the key
is really gonna be, you know,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.638
Getting that feeling
with the clutch

04:32.640 --> 04:35.774
And not stalling it 'cause
it's got a very touchy clutch.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.376
So, you're gonna have
lots of rpm.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.111
And then, just find
that bite point.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.280
Get those tires spinning,
and off you go.

04:41.282 --> 04:45.250
With a top speed
of over 240 miles per hour,

04:45.252 --> 04:47.919
These are the fastest race cars
in the world,

04:47.921 --> 04:51.757
And Adam's pretty quick to get
his butt behind the wheel.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.226
All right,
I'm gonna start it up.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.397
Wow.
I feel a rumble in my soul.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.199
"Rumble" is right
because this car goes

05:01.201 --> 05:04.503
From zero to 100
in three seconds flat.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.372
Let's see
how Adam handles the horses.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.344
Well, that was a little spotty.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.746
I'm gonna give it
another few tries.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.215
Any minute now,
I'll be ready for Hyneman.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.817
After four practice starts,

05:18.819 --> 05:22.120
Adam's convinced
he was born to burn rubber.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.922
So, cue test number one --

05:23.924 --> 05:27.592
700 horsepower
versus one hopeful Hyneman.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.495
You wouldn't think it would be
much of a contest,

05:30.497 --> 05:31.229
But here's the thing.

05:31.231 --> 05:34.499
I weigh a little over a tenth
as much as that car does.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.302
So, I might just be a little
quicker getting off the line.

05:37.304 --> 05:42.607
The feeling trackside is it's
gonna be close, so let's see.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.210
Are you ready?
Start your engines.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.646
go!

05:48.314 --> 05:52.150
Sure enough, there's
barely the width of a moustache

05:52.152 --> 05:52.718
Between them.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.753
I don't know.
It was a close finish.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.520
That was close!

05:55.522 --> 05:58.824
The high-speed shows
Adam flashing through for a win

05:58.826 --> 06:00.425
In the last fraction
of a second.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.961
It's so close
there's no question

06:02.963 --> 06:05.630
This calls for a do-over.

06:07.066 --> 06:08.400
Start your engines.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.537
Go!

06:13.172 --> 06:15.974
To the naked eye,
it's another close call,

06:15.976 --> 06:19.711
But the high-speed shows Adam
has increased his edge.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.312
How'd that go?

06:20.314 --> 06:23.582
You were ahead of me
by about three feet that time.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.683
Really?
Yeah.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.918
It's amazing to watch it
because I'm leading you

06:26.920 --> 06:30.722
Right up until about I'm ready
to cross the finish line.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.858
And then, there you are,
and you're gone.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.927
I did spin out a bunch
at the starting line.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.462
You want to go one more time?
Yeah.

06:37.464 --> 06:41.900
This is Jamie's last chance
to confirm the myth

06:41.902 --> 06:44.503
And boost the morale
of pedestrians everywhere.

06:47.607 --> 06:53.245
But it's not
third time's a charm.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.946
I think
I got my ass kicked.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.384
This time, Adam wins out
by way more than a nose.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.919
I thought I did pretty well.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.156
A couple of those runs, I was
neck-and-neck with the car.

07:04.158 --> 07:07.325
But I'm just wearing
street clothes,

07:07.327 --> 07:09.995
And maybe if we put somebody
in proper gear,

07:09.997 --> 07:12.230
And maybe if that person
happened to be

07:12.232 --> 07:15.167
A little younger than me,
a.K.A. Adam,

07:15.169 --> 07:18.270
He might have a fighting chance.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.105
Yep.

07:20.107 --> 07:20.772
Just down the track,

07:20.774 --> 07:25.610
We've got sprint-king Savage
up against hair-trigger Hyneman.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.946
He's no usain bolt,

07:27.948 --> 07:31.750
But the finish of this race
is certified gold.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.355
Next up is
a "lose weight real fast" myth

07:37.357 --> 07:40.058
That should get
anyone's motor racing.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.527
Okay, Indy Car Special.
What have we got?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.028
All right.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.530
This one sounds a little fishy,
but here it goes.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.165
It's that,
during the course of a race,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.935
An IndyCar driver
can lose 10 pounds.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.703
Seriously?
10 whole pounds?

07:51.705 --> 07:52.871
That's what they say.

07:52.873 --> 07:53.638
Wait a minute.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.407
Does this mean
we're gonna be driving race cars

07:55.409 --> 07:57.843
To test this myth?
I hope so.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.578
I'm gonna go suit up.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.379
Excited much?

08:03.650 --> 08:08.253
If this diet dilemma is true,
it's one of the most exciting

08:08.255 --> 08:12.557
And potentially perilous ways
ever to slim down in a hurry.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.495
The weight these drivers
supposedly shed

08:16.497 --> 08:21.399
Is due to extreme exertion
and plenty of perspiration.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.236
But 10 pounds is
more than most of us

08:24.238 --> 08:26.171
Could hope to lose in a month.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.439
All right.
I'm ready to race.

08:27.441 --> 08:30.175
Since this is about
sweat, maybe we should
narrow it down first

08:30.177 --> 08:32.510
And find out how much
water weight you would lose

08:32.513 --> 08:34.813
In three hours
from just heat alone.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.480
That's a good idea.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.082
That way, we could get a
baseline before we hit the road

08:38.085 --> 08:41.019
And see if driving itself
causes you to lose

08:41.020 --> 08:42.721
More or less weight
than that.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.923
Exactly.
Kari, know any good spas?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.458
Well,
that's a stupid question.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.462
Better question is
where did you have a race suit?

08:50.464 --> 08:52.097
I'm always prepared.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.366
The green flag drops
on the control test,

08:54.368 --> 08:56.968
So for now, Tory can leave
the race suit behind.

08:56.970 --> 09:02.107
Down here, the dress code is --
well, let's call it relaxed.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.476
Now, we do a lot of crazy things
on "Mythbusters,"

09:04.478 --> 09:06.811
And most of them
aren't that pleasant.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.114
But finally,
we're doing an experiment

09:09.116 --> 09:12.417
Where it sounds like
it's not gonna be so bad.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.522
Think again because a sauna
gets up to 120 degrees,

09:17.524 --> 09:21.359
Which is the same temperature as
the inside of an Indy cockpit,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.895
And we're gonna be in there
for three hours,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.464
Which is the same length of time
as a full race.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.601
In fact, things just
might turn unpleasant enough

09:29.603 --> 09:31.603
For some medical monitoring.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.572
And we've got that stitched up.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.107
Dr. Clifford sewell
will be monitoring us.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.511
We have thermometers
that we've swallowed...

09:39.513 --> 09:40.779
For science.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.181
...Ingestible thermometers
that are wireless.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.349
He can take our core temperature

09:44.351 --> 09:45.750
And make sure
that everything's okay.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.553
well, that was a big one.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.288
They'll weigh themselves now,

09:50.290 --> 09:52.490
Then again when the three-hour
furnace has finished.

09:52.492 --> 09:57.729
Tory's the first to proclaim
his poundage to the public.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.632
Okay, so, I weight 176.

10:00.634 --> 10:04.102
As for Kari's gross tonnage...

10:04.104 --> 10:06.538
I'll write it down.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.142
Grant strains the scales
up to...

10:11.144 --> 10:11.943
137?

10:11.945 --> 10:16.081
Now all that's required is
a sizable snooze in the sauna.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.550
But how much of their mass
will go missing?

10:18.552 --> 10:19.884
Whew!
Three hours of this?

10:19.886 --> 10:21.620
this is hot!

10:21.622 --> 10:24.022
Now, normally, when you're
in a sauna, it's very steamy.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.890
But as you can see,
we're going with the dry sauna.

10:25.892 --> 10:29.694
The reason why is if there's
too much moisture in the air,

10:29.696 --> 10:30.362
It's too saturated.

10:30.364 --> 10:31.796
When we sweat,
our sweat won't evaporate,

10:31.798 --> 10:34.733
Which means we won't be losing
weight from losing the moisture.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.802
This is a common method
for people to shed

10:37.804 --> 10:38.970
Some water weight
really quickly.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.574
Models, jockeys, fighters,
they all do this kind of thing.

10:42.576 --> 10:46.544
So, I mean,
I think it's a possibility.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.613
10 pounds is quite a lot.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.881
I'm not looking forward to it.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.018
Hey, you guys come to the sauna
often?

10:53.020 --> 10:53.918
Aah!

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
Ew! Really?

10:58.525 --> 11:02.527
As the minutes
and hours melt away,

11:02.529 --> 11:05.563
The perspiration puddles
and pools,

11:05.565 --> 11:07.966
And it seems like
each of our sweat hogs

11:07.968 --> 11:10.902
Has his own odd response
to heat stress.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.606
For Tory, it's all just a drive
in the park...

11:14.608 --> 11:17.776
You see, I'm pretending like
I'm driving an IndyCar.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.112
...While Grant has his eye
on the instruments.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.582
Apparently, my intestines
are measuring 101 degrees.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.685
According to science,
Grant's hot.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.854
But with just minutes
of hot-house hardship

11:29.856 --> 11:30.455
Left to endure,

11:30.457 --> 11:33.324
The guys decide
they can brazen it out.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.193
Thank god we are done
with the experiment.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.695
We've been in here
for three hours.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.930
Now it's time to go out
and weigh ourselves

11:38.932 --> 11:39.631
And see if we lost weight.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.467
It's a good thing 'cause I was
about to lose the towel.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.869
I'm lightheaded.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.505
All right, Grant.
You weighed 137 before the test.

11:47.507 --> 11:51.309
Get on the scale and see
how much weight you lost.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.745
136.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.747
All right.
So, you lost a pound.

11:55.749 --> 11:59.284
The news is no better
for she who suffered most.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.720
Looks like you lost
one pound of weight.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.189
That was just one pound?
Yeah.

12:04.624 --> 12:08.760
And for the man who did get in
some driving practice...

12:08.762 --> 12:09.894
Wow, I lost two pounds.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.397
That's far from the 10 pounds
the myth talks about,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.065
So it's got to be
more than heat.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.101
It's got to also be exertion
and stress.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.869
Well,
you know what that means.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.838
I think we need to add driving
to the mix.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.740
Let's hit the showers.
It's that way.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.374
Sweet.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.211
After the break...

12:26.213 --> 12:26.811
Whoo-hoo!

12:26.813 --> 12:28.913
...Tory tries
to lose 10 fast pounds

12:28.915 --> 12:30.315
Without hitting the wall...

12:30.317 --> 12:32.550
My heart is racing
a little bit faster now.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.085
...While Adam redlines

12:34.087 --> 12:36.788
In the challenge
of beating the IndyCar.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.524
Oh, my god.
It's so close!

12:39.526 --> 12:42.026
That's crazy.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.334
There's not much on four wheels

12:49.336 --> 12:52.137
That could outrun
a turbocharged IndyCar,

12:52.139 --> 12:55.507
But one myth says
a man could do just that

12:55.509 --> 12:58.409
If the course
was just 30 feet long.

12:58.411 --> 13:02.347
And while vintage Jamie
ran out of steam...

13:02.349 --> 13:03.148
I think I got my ass kicked.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.785
...A slightly younger model
might reverse the result...

13:06.787 --> 13:07.452
Now it's my turn to run.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.221
...With the help
of an added spring at the start.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.391
So, Jamie was running from what
I would call a standing start.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.227
I'm going to use
a little technology to help me,

13:16.229 --> 13:20.298
A racer's set of chocks.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.636
Now I'm ready.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.971
Start your engines.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.840
Go!

13:30.410 --> 13:31.810
Ohh!

13:31.812 --> 13:34.245
It's officially a photo finish,

13:34.247 --> 13:38.383
And Adam's the first to consult
with the stewards.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.652
Oh, my god.
It's so close!

13:40.654 --> 13:44.122
That's crazy.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.558
He is literally beating me
by a nose --

13:46.560 --> 13:50.628
By, like, the five inches
of the nose of the IndyCar.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.798
Let's do it again!

13:56.636 --> 13:57.902
Aah!

13:58.404 --> 14:01.506
I don't think I won!
But I was close!

14:01.508 --> 14:04.108
Well, that's one way to put it.

14:04.110 --> 14:04.943
The replay confirms

14:04.945 --> 14:09.180
That this race
was a frame-perfect dead heat.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.851
Jamie, that was a tie.

14:12.853 --> 14:13.484
Way to go.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.253
You want to go one more time?
Sure. Why not?

14:15.255 --> 14:15.753
All right.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.958
This will be Adam's last run,
and, boy, does he know it.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.161
I want to win.
I want to win so badly.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.196
Go!

14:29.769 --> 14:33.404
I think he smoked me
on that one. Shoot!

14:33.406 --> 14:36.274
It's exactly what happened
to Jamie with his runs.

14:36.276 --> 14:41.246
Third time unlucky on those
fast-fading, middle-aged legs.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.548
That might be
some of the most fun I've had

14:43.550 --> 14:44.249
Testing a myth ever.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.617
Yeah,
those cars are great.

14:45.619 --> 14:46.951
I'll tell you
what I'm seeing.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.354
When I'm running
and you're driving,

14:49.356 --> 14:50.655
We've got a shot
at the beginning

14:50.657 --> 14:52.690
That makes it look like
I'm smoking the car.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.424
I'm way faster off the line,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.427
But 30 feet later,
you're ahead of me.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.595
Yeah,
I saw the same thing.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.163
I thought
I was winning the race.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.366
And then, there's a car,
and it's gone.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.702
I don't think we can call it
based on these tests alone.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.138
No. We're not done yet.
No.

15:12.144 --> 15:15.246
Grant, Tory, and Kari
are sweating on a myth

15:15.248 --> 15:16.948
That says an IndyCar driver

15:16.950 --> 15:20.018
Can drop 10 whole pounds
in body weight

15:20.020 --> 15:21.986
During a three-hour road race.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.955
But an experimental sweat-a-thon

15:23.957 --> 15:27.625
Saw them shed just four pounds
between them,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.761
So it's time to shift up a gear.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.929
All right,
so, to properly test this,

15:30.931 --> 15:34.098
We need to go to the source,
which means we're also going

15:34.100 --> 15:36.834
To the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

15:36.836 --> 15:37.635
But there's a catch.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.706
There's only one car,
so only one of us can drive.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.007
All right, I'll do it.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.476
I'll take the bullet here.
I'm willing to do this.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.345
No, I think
we should wrestle for it.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.947
No, no, no.

15:48.949 --> 15:49.681
Wait a minute.

15:49.683 --> 15:54.118
Roshambo?
It's the only fair way.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.322
Yes!

15:57.324 --> 15:59.390
I'm super-happy for you.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.894
Let's do this!
That felt good.

16:03.495 --> 16:06.497
We decided to come here because
we needed to step it up.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.168
We need to find out if Tory
can ride around this track

16:10.170 --> 16:11.169
And lose 10 pounds.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.172
But first,
we're gonna need a car.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.275
And this is the car.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.343
It's a dallara.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.846
It weighs about 1,200 pounds,
has 750 horsepower,

16:21.848 --> 16:25.583
Is capable of driving
at 210 miles per hour,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.618
And can pull two to three g's.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.886
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.056
It costs about $1 million
to put this car on the track.

16:32.058 --> 16:36.127
And while Tory gets
some intensive driver's ed...

16:36.129 --> 16:38.730
Don't be afraid to let out
and gas at the same time.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.365
You kind of want to go...

16:40.367 --> 16:42.900
...Grant and Kari get
a first-hand account

16:42.902 --> 16:44.002
Of the punishing pursuit

16:44.004 --> 16:47.205
These pro drivers go through
from Ryan Briscoe.

16:47.207 --> 16:51.309
Each time I hit the brake pedal,
it's like 150 pounds.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.177
And I'll be doing that
literally hundreds,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.713
Maybe, you know,
thousands of times in a race.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.317
And the steering wheel
is really heavy.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.284
No power steering.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.755
It's like pushing probably
40-pound to 50-pound weights

17:03.757 --> 17:05.522
Every time
I'm turning the wheel.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.493
And that is, like,
thousands and thousands of times

17:09.496 --> 17:10.261
During the race.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.896
Sounds like racing at Indy

17:11.897 --> 17:13.798
Amounts
to a three-hour boot camp.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.335
Couple that with the heat
and the pulse-thumping terror

17:17.337 --> 17:20.538
Of taking
these 200-mile-an-hour turns --

17:20.540 --> 17:23.441
Well, you can see how you might
kick a few calories.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.444
Was that so much fun?

17:26.445 --> 17:27.779
It didn't suck.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.615
There's
just one piece of business

17:30.617 --> 17:32.483
To tend to before the big race.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.120
All right, so, the weigh-in --
184 pounds.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.356
All right. So, that's
your before-race weight.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.292
For this to be confirmed,
after you're done,

17:41.294 --> 17:42.760
That's got to say 174.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.229
What are you waiting for?
Go get in the car!

17:45.231 --> 17:45.730
All right.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.532
you got three whole hours.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.333
Tick-tock.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.503
There's a lot of pressure on me
right now.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.541
And I'm not gonna lie --
I'm a little nervous.

17:57.976 --> 17:58.543
Who am I kidding?

17:58.545 --> 18:01.479
I'm about to drive an IndyCar
for three hours! Whoo-hoo!

18:01.481 --> 18:04.449
All he has to do
is stay on the track, go fast,

18:04.451 --> 18:08.386
Pump some break-pedal iron,
and perspire freely,

18:08.388 --> 18:11.089
Which should be, well,
no sweat.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.091
I'm in the zone.
Let's do this.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.693
All right. Good luck.
Thanks.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.700
That looks like
so much fun!

18:22.702 --> 18:25.736
Now, here's
why Tory might lose 10 pounds.

18:25.738 --> 18:29.607
He's covered head-to-toe
in fire-retardant material,

18:29.609 --> 18:30.508
Including a head sock.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.412
Then, he's got his race uniform
and his helmet.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.046
He's gonna be hot,

18:35.048 --> 18:37.782
And that means he gonna sweat
in order to cool down.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.951
And then, there's the exertion.

18:39.953 --> 18:40.952
Even at these speeds,

18:40.954 --> 18:43.087
This car generates
a lot of downforce,

18:43.089 --> 18:46.390
Which means the steering's gonna
be really hard in every turn.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.459
Finally, there's the stress.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.864
See, most of this course,
the walls are concrete.

18:52.866 --> 18:53.598
You make one mistake,

18:53.600 --> 18:55.700
If you have
one lapse in judgment,

18:55.702 --> 18:56.667
You're in the concrete,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.035
And a $1 million car
is destroyed,

18:58.037 --> 19:01.072
Not to mention risking injury
or death.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.373
That's a lot to think about.

19:02.375 --> 19:06.477
In fact, there's almost no end
to the stresses and strains.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.881
On the turns, Tory's pulling
as much as three g's,

19:09.883 --> 19:12.316
And that means he feels like
he's carrying

19:12.318 --> 19:14.585
Three times his own weight.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.321
My neck muscles
are definitely sore

19:17.323 --> 19:18.289
Trying to keep in position

19:18.291 --> 19:21.225
As I'm going around those turns
at high speeds.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.894
My arms are getting sore.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.129
I keep my foot slammed
on the gas

19:25.131 --> 19:26.998
Probably harder than I have to,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.667
But the adrenaline is rushing
so much

19:29.669 --> 19:32.870
That I kind of forget
that I'm doing it.

19:35.007 --> 19:39.410
The adrenaline's pretty much
worn off for Grant and Kari.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.311
There's a limit to how long

19:40.313 --> 19:43.481
You can watch someone else
have the time of his life.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.055
Whoo!

19:51.057 --> 19:52.723
Whoo!

19:53.158 --> 19:55.293
I wish I had a watch on.

19:55.295 --> 19:59.063
Back on the track, Tory's
delight has turned to disquiet.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.965
So, it's just started raining.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.701
I don't have any rain tires
on this car,

20:03.703 --> 20:05.336
So the stress factor
has just gone up

20:05.338 --> 20:06.704
Because there is
a very good chance

20:06.706 --> 20:08.839
That I could go sliding
into the wall.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.842
My heart is racing
a little bit faster now.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.411
Tory's heart might be faster,

20:13.413 --> 20:16.147
But his speed has dropped off
in the drizzle.

20:16.149 --> 20:21.619
For the last hour,
his top speed is just over 120.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.224
How was that?

20:26.226 --> 20:29.126
Is that it?
Three hours is up already?

20:29.128 --> 20:29.560
It is.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.662
That's it, man. You're done.
oh, my god.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.632
I am exhausted, and I feel
sweaty as I could possibly be.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.636
After three whole hours
and with all that exertion,

20:38.638 --> 20:40.938
Tory's just about swimming
in sweat.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.874
All right. You ready
for the final weigh-in?

20:43.876 --> 20:44.976
Yes.
All right.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.143
After three hours
of driving,

20:46.145 --> 20:48.746
I don't know
if 10 pounds were lost.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.049
181.
I lost 3 pounds in three hours.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.084
Dude, that's it?

20:53.086 --> 20:54.885
That's nowhere near the
10 pounds the myth talks about.

20:54.887 --> 20:59.423
The myth would seem to be
just about dead in the water,

20:59.425 --> 20:59.991
But maybe not.

20:59.993 --> 21:03.294
The rain slowed Tory down
for almost an hour...

21:03.296 --> 21:04.762
And no other cars on the track

21:04.764 --> 21:07.598
Means less stress
and less exertion.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.333
And that's not the end of it.

21:09.335 --> 21:12.303
Now, another factor,
and perhaps the biggest one,

21:12.305 --> 21:13.137
Is the temperature.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.373
We're here at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,

21:15.375 --> 21:17.541
But we're here
in the off season.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.644
During the Indy 500,
it wouldn't raining,

21:19.646 --> 21:21.712
And it would be
about 30 degrees warmer.

21:21.714 --> 21:25.816
One thing they can't do
is hang here till summer,

21:25.818 --> 21:28.185
So it's time
to warm up a plan "b"

21:28.187 --> 21:30.921
And get this myth
to the finish line.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.558
Still to come, we find out
if IndyCar suction...

21:34.560 --> 21:35.693
Holy crap!

21:35.695 --> 21:37.762
...Can literally
rip up the road.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.498
You're getting faster.
149.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.866
Beautiful.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.675
Now to tackle a myth
that starts,

21:50.677 --> 21:53.010
And might end, in the sewer.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.516
I've got one.
Okay, shoot.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.585
You know, I've heard that
at about 150 miles an hour,

22:01.587 --> 22:03.788
When IndyCars are doing
a street race,

22:03.790 --> 22:06.257
Their aerodynamic effects
are enough

22:06.259 --> 22:09.694
To pull manhole covers
right out of the manholes.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.161
No way.

22:10.163 --> 22:14.165
Dude, that is totally something
we have to test.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.333
I thought you'd like that.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.469
When IndyCars
take to the street,

22:18.471 --> 22:22.873
It's standard practice
to weld shut any manhole covers

22:22.875 --> 22:26.010
In case the cars suck them
right out of the ground.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.880
That's because IndyCars
are built to take full advantage

22:29.882 --> 22:30.748
Of bernoulli's principle.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.118
As the air underneath the car
gets funneled faster,

22:34.120 --> 22:36.220
It causes the air pressure
to drop,

22:36.222 --> 22:39.390
Helping the car
to stick to the road.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.458
That same downforce

22:40.460 --> 22:43.294
Can supposedly suck up
a manhole cover.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.796
But is this myth destined
for the drain?

22:45.798 --> 22:49.467
This manhole-cover story
is gonna be hard to test.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.569
There's a ton of logistics
just making sure

22:51.571 --> 22:54.138
We don't damage the IndyCars
in any way.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.006
Well, what say
we get our feet wet first

22:56.008 --> 22:57.942
With a small-scale
at nasa's water tunnel?

22:57.944 --> 23:01.045
See if there's anything
to this suction effect at all

23:01.047 --> 23:03.647
And then go from there?
Exactly.

23:03.649 --> 23:04.548
Perfect.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.318
I'm standing in the nasa
ames research facility's

23:07.320 --> 23:09.854
Fluid mechanics lab,
and this place

23:09.856 --> 23:12.289
Is almost like
one of our second shops.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.324
In that wind tunnel right there,

23:13.326 --> 23:16.861
We tested whether or not you
should leave your windows open

23:16.863 --> 23:17.995
In a hurricane.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.263
It doesn't matter!

23:19.265 --> 23:20.798
Today, it's all about race cars.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.468
They're studying
the car's aerodynamics,

23:24.470 --> 23:26.670
But they'll do it with water.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.806
Air and water
are very different mediums,

23:28.808 --> 23:30.408
But when engineers work
with them,

23:30.410 --> 23:32.810
They tend to think of them both
as fluids.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.679
And because water is
so much more dense than air,

23:35.681 --> 23:39.283
If we inject a dye
into a moving column of it,

23:39.285 --> 23:40.651
We can more clearly visualize

23:40.653 --> 23:43.721
How it's interacting
with another object.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.290
In this case,
our object is the car.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.292
The first test is simply to see

23:48.294 --> 23:52.463
How the currents are moving
around their 1/18-scale IndyCar.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.398
All right.
Let's turn on the dye.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.502
This is where science
gets seriously seductive.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.439
Ohh.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.507
Oh, that is so beautiful.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.443
Once this smoothes out,

24:05.445 --> 24:07.812
I feel like we might see
something underneath.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.381
Looks like the bottom surface
of the car

24:10.383 --> 24:13.951
Is very,
incredibly low-turbulence.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.052
The water tunnel,

24:15.054 --> 24:16.120
In addition
to looking really cool,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.022
Is actually giving us exactly
what we were hoping to see.

24:18.024 --> 24:21.091
That is, these cars are famous
for their downforce,

24:21.093 --> 24:23.260
How much air pressure
they're able to use

24:23.262 --> 24:24.995
To push themselves
into the ground

24:24.997 --> 24:26.730
And give themselves
more traction.

24:26.732 --> 24:27.398
If that's the case,

24:27.400 --> 24:30.701
We would expect to watch this
move air over its top

24:30.703 --> 24:31.902
Rather than under its bottom,

24:31.904 --> 24:34.104
And that's what we're seeing
from the model.

24:34.106 --> 24:37.241
Now that we've seen that, it's
time to find out what happens

24:37.243 --> 24:40.211
When we drive this model
over a scaled manhole cover,

24:40.213 --> 24:41.679
And that's
what our next test is.

24:41.681 --> 24:45.449
Adam's mini manhole
weighs next to nothing,

24:45.451 --> 24:47.485
But it might disclose a clue
as to whether

24:47.487 --> 24:50.621
The shape of the car can show up
some suction.

24:50.623 --> 24:51.489
There we go.

24:51.491 --> 24:55.226
For good measure, he pumps
red dye into the tiny tunnel

24:55.228 --> 24:58.195
To see if the predicted change
in pressure

24:58.197 --> 25:00.764
Sucks it up to the surface.

25:02.033 --> 25:05.169
Ohh!
Look at that!

25:05.171 --> 25:06.537
So,
our little car picked up

25:06.539 --> 25:08.372
Our little,
plastic manhole cover

25:08.374 --> 25:09.874
And took it
right along with it.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.343
So, that means there <i>is</i>
<i>some kind of suction</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:13.944
Being created by this car.

25:13.946 --> 25:17.047
To be clear, the car never
actually touches the cover.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.984
But the drag of its shape
is sufficient

25:19.986 --> 25:23.354
To pry loose the plastic
and release the red dye.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.257
It really seems like
the forces we were looking for

25:26.259 --> 25:27.491
Might actually be there,

25:27.493 --> 25:30.060
And that gives us
a perfect excuse,

25:30.062 --> 25:30.961
As if we needed one,

25:30.963 --> 25:34.131
To get to driving
some real-sized IndyCars.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.301
I'm gonna need a new outfit,
clearly.

25:39.170 --> 25:42.706
You know, the IndyCar experience
wasn't that great.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.674
It was awesome!

25:43.676 --> 25:45.142
But unfortunately,
we were not able

25:45.144 --> 25:46.410
To test this myth
thoroughly

25:46.412 --> 25:49.280
Because the conditions
weren't the same as a real race.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.582
Yeah, you know,
it wasn't very hot in the car,

25:51.584 --> 25:53.117
And you didn't have
the stress

25:53.119 --> 25:54.985
Of a real,
competitive situation,

25:54.987 --> 25:57.621
Both of which
would have made you sweat more.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.123
I thin I have a solution
for this.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.991
I know a track nearby
that's phenomenal.

26:00.993 --> 26:04.562
It's gonna be hot,
and we all can drive on it,

26:04.564 --> 26:07.131
So it's more like
a real race.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.999
Cool.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.735
The new venue is
thunderhill raceway

26:11.737 --> 26:13.470
In willows, california.

26:13.472 --> 26:17.308
It's a very different kind
of track, and so are the cars.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.910
All right. Now,
I know what you're thinking.

26:19.912 --> 26:20.611
These aren't IndyCars.

26:20.613 --> 26:24.181
But here's why this test
might give us better data

26:24.183 --> 26:25.349
Than the previous one.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.750
Number one, temperature --

26:26.752 --> 26:29.353
It's 90 degrees out here
at thunderhill today,

26:29.355 --> 26:30.688
And that's not even inside
the car.

26:30.690 --> 26:34.658
In these suits, in the cockpit,
we're definitely gonna feel it.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.659
Number two, physical exertion --

26:35.661 --> 26:37.861
These cars, they don't have
any power steering.

26:37.863 --> 26:40.731
So, we're gonna be
constantly fighting the wheel

26:40.733 --> 26:41.465
To keep it on the track.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.034
Finally, number three,
competition --

26:44.036 --> 26:48.973
All three of us are gonna be
on the track at the same time

26:48.975 --> 26:50.574
In a real race scenario.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.141
Should be fun.

26:51.143 --> 26:55.312
I got to tell you now though,
I'm sort of scared "shiftless."

26:55.314 --> 26:56.647
You'd better believe it.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.750
In fact, Kari's so distracted
that this time,

26:59.752 --> 27:02.286
She announces her weight
to the world.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.956
my beginning weight is 124.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.492
Grant follows.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.828
Oh, really? 145?

27:10.830 --> 27:11.762
Then, Tory.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.696
All right, 180.

27:12.698 --> 27:15.799
So, after this race,
I should weight 170,

27:15.801 --> 27:16.867
If this myth is true.

27:16.869 --> 27:20.337
Let's start shifting
those pounds off.

27:21.506 --> 27:25.275
Once they've all had
a last-minute health check...

27:25.277 --> 27:27.011
About 74. Excellent.

27:27.013 --> 27:31.148
...Our three rookie racers
get the green light.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.016
Hold on.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.788
And within minutes,
they're feeling the heat.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.957
I'm feeling
extraordinarily sweaty,

27:39.959 --> 27:43.293
And I feel a lot of exertion
on to --

27:44.063 --> 27:45.162
Well, that would be
turn number 11,

27:45.164 --> 27:48.999
Where I'm having a hard time
keeping the car on the track.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.003
Ohh.
Goodness gracious, that's fast.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.874
So, apparently,
the car has a mind of its own

27:56.876 --> 27:58.842
And wants to go off-roading.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.578
Even with only three cars,

28:01.580 --> 28:03.414
I'm definitely feeling
an adrenaline bump

28:03.416 --> 28:07.051
Whenever I get close to Kari,
who's going much slower,

28:07.053 --> 28:10.487
Or I try and catch Tory,
who's going much faster.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.457
It just raises
that level of adrenaline,

28:13.459 --> 28:16.527
And that adrenaline burst
raises your heart rate

28:16.529 --> 28:20.564
And in turn burns
a lot more calories.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.032
Just like at Indy,

28:22.034 --> 28:23.767
They'll stop twice
through the race

28:23.769 --> 28:27.337
To refuel and regain
some composure.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.972
Do you feel dehydrated
at all?

28:28.974 --> 28:31.575
I'm -- like, my throat
is super-dry.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.910
Then, it's back to the tarmac

28:32.912 --> 28:36.146
To hopefully forfeit
another few pounds.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.482
It occurs to me
that there are three things

28:38.484 --> 28:41.952
That make this a much different
test than the sauna.

28:41.954 --> 28:42.653
One is concentration.

28:42.655 --> 28:47.291
You have to focus entirely
on keeping this car on the road.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.293
If you lapse for a second,

28:49.295 --> 28:52.029
You're off the road
and in the the dirt.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.630
Two, this is a workout.

28:53.632 --> 28:54.965
This is no power steering,

28:54.967 --> 28:58.302
So you actually have to
muscle it into place.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.937
And the third thing --
it's the g load.

28:59.939 --> 29:04.141
Let's just wind
back to that first thing again.

29:04.143 --> 29:08.645
I'm sure Grant murmured
something about concentration.

29:16.921 --> 29:17.821
Ah.

29:17.823 --> 29:21.725
Just a momentary lapse
in concentration,

29:21.727 --> 29:24.828
And I was off the tracks,
spinning out,

29:24.830 --> 29:27.164
Dirt flying everywhere.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.637
This is hard.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.471
Real hard.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.775
Back on the track,
Tory's still pushing the pedal

29:37.777 --> 29:39.343
As hard as he did on lap one.

29:39.345 --> 29:44.148
This is probably the best day of
experimenting ever on this show.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.383
I'm exhausted. I'm sweaty.
I'm hot.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.585
My body is getting fatigued.
I'm sore.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.821
My neck is sore from holding
the weight of the helmet.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.624
I don't know if I'm losing
10 pounds of sweat weight,

29:53.626 --> 29:55.893
But, man, it's tough work.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.029
With Kari and Grant
also back on the road --

29:59.031 --> 30:00.564
Well, mostly on the road...

30:00.566 --> 30:06.103
...The minutes melt away
to the magic three-hour mark.

30:08.907 --> 30:09.540
I am exhausted.

30:09.542 --> 30:13.177
I honestly didn't think
I would be this tired.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.113
I feel like I just got beat up.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.648
The truth of this myth rests

30:17.650 --> 30:19.183
On the numbers they'll read
on the scale.

30:19.185 --> 30:23.086
They know they've put everything
into this last-ditch attempt,

30:23.088 --> 30:25.222
And it's ladies first.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.191
Let's see.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.926
5 1/2 pounds I lost.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.460
What?
Wow.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.262
That's amazing.
Oh, my gosh.

30:32.264 --> 30:32.796
What a diet.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.698
That's almost half the weight
of the myth.

30:34.700 --> 30:35.933
All right, Grant.
All right.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.301
Let's see
how much you lost.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.236
4 1/2 pounds.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.871
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.072
I had no idea.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.041
That's
pretty incredible.

30:44.642 --> 30:47.077
I lost 5 pounds
after three hours of racing.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.713
I mean, that's half the weight
that the myth talks about.

30:49.715 --> 30:53.183
There's no question
that race-car reducing

30:53.185 --> 30:54.284
Works like a charm.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.254
But is it thumbs up
or thumbs down

30:57.256 --> 30:58.622
For this IndyCar myth?

30:58.624 --> 31:00.023
So,
how we gonna call this one?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.458
Well,
after three hours of racing,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.560
We did manage to lose,
on average, five pounds,

31:03.562 --> 31:06.330
But that's not the 10 pounds
that the myth talks about.

31:06.332 --> 31:07.831
Yeah,
but, what we're doing out there

31:07.833 --> 31:09.733
And a real Indy race
are a little different.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.902
Yeah, you know,
I could see a real Indy race

31:11.904 --> 31:13.503
Being
a lot more physically demanding.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.372
I could see,
under the right conditions,

31:15.374 --> 31:16.907
With everything
they have on the line,

31:16.909 --> 31:18.909
That they could lose
twice the weight that we did.

31:18.911 --> 31:22.512
Yeah. Right set of circumstances
not an everyday occurrence,

31:22.514 --> 31:24.414
I think we could call this one
plausible.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.582
I agree. Plausible.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.617
Now, who's driving home?

31:26.619 --> 31:28.385
Not you.
Let's just say that.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.687
Me!
What?

31:38.329 --> 31:40.564
Please, don't try what you're
about to see at home.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.566
We're surrounded by experts
that keep us safe.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.368
We get hurt
so you don't have to.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.035
Welcome back.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.104
We're at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway,

31:47.106 --> 31:51.174
And it's IndyCar
versus manhole cover.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.809
We're gonna bring an IndyCar
up to full speed

31:52.811 --> 31:55.879
And see whether its aerodynamics
are powerful enough

31:55.881 --> 31:59.716
To suck a manhole cover
right out of the ground.

32:00.652 --> 32:01.618
Well, look at that.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.254
A manhole --
in the middle of nowhere.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.222
It's not in the middle
of nowhere.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.991
We are in the middle of the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex,

32:07.993 --> 32:10.494
And they dug this
just for our experiment.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.496
Cool.
I'm gonna get to work.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.364
And there's plenty to do.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.499
As well as installing a camera,

32:15.501 --> 32:18.168
They're hooking a force gauge
up to the cover

32:18.170 --> 32:20.904
To measure how much it moves,
if at all.

32:20.906 --> 32:24.474
But the star and the source
of this myth is the cover.

32:24.476 --> 32:25.075
Beautiful.

32:25.077 --> 32:28.145
They made this one themselves
from clear plastic

32:28.147 --> 32:30.714
So sunlight gets through
for the cameras.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.783
And it weighs 30 pounds.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.151
I know what you're saying.

32:34.153 --> 32:38.722
You're saying, "Adam, your see-through manhole
cover doesn't weigh near as much

32:38.724 --> 32:40.724
As a cast-iron manhole cover.

32:40.726 --> 32:41.959
How can this be
an accurate test?

32:41.961 --> 32:44.861
And you're right, except that
we've already thought of it.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.097
We are going to make this weigh
as much as this

32:47.099 --> 32:50.434
With these four chunks
of four-inch-diameter steel.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.804
We are going to bolt them to
the see-through manhole cover,

32:53.806 --> 32:55.706
And it will weigh
exactly as much

32:55.708 --> 32:57.808
As a cast-iron manhole cover.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.277
We got you covered.

33:00.279 --> 33:00.811
There it is.

33:00.813 --> 33:04.181
One scientifically accurate
manhole cover.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.782
And while nobody knows

33:05.784 --> 33:07.351
How this full-scale test
will pan out,

33:07.353 --> 33:11.888
They've all considered
the possible perils of success.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.523
When the car
comes down this road

33:13.525 --> 33:15.692
At 150 miles an hour
and drives over it,

33:15.694 --> 33:17.928
It might just lift
out of the ground.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.029
And that could be very bad

33:19.031 --> 33:21.365
For an instrument as precise
as an IndyCar

33:21.367 --> 33:25.802
With a ground clearance
of as low as 7/8 of an inch.

33:25.804 --> 33:26.670
So, Jamie, right now,

33:26.672 --> 33:28.438
Is tying
some very high-strength line

33:28.440 --> 33:31.508
So that, when we have
the manhole cover in place,

33:31.510 --> 33:33.643
It can only lift
about half an inch.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.879
It won't be able
to actually hurt the car,

33:35.881 --> 33:38.482
But we'll still be able
to measure the force

33:38.484 --> 33:40.150
That it's
actually being pulled up with.

33:40.152 --> 33:45.522
Logan gomez is our driver --
or should I say chauffeur --

33:45.524 --> 33:48.158
Because Adam will also have
his butt

33:48.160 --> 33:50.193
Just an inch off the bitumen.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.294
The car is a tandem.

33:51.296 --> 33:55.999
This is where the literal rubber
meets the literal road

33:56.001 --> 33:57.367
Meets the manhole cover.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.436
This Indy racing experience car

33:59.438 --> 34:03.440
Exerts just as much downforce
as the real thing.

34:03.442 --> 34:07.477
Target speed for today's test
is 150 miles per hour,

34:07.479 --> 34:10.514
Pretty much the top speed
for a city-street circuit.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.949
In lieu of a steering wheel,
my seat is equipped with these.

34:13.952 --> 34:18.054
We call the hchs. They're
known as holy crap handles.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.956
Holy crap!
Just hold on really tight.

34:19.958 --> 34:23.226
With Adam's knuckles
whitening by the second,

34:23.228 --> 34:25.929
Jamie takes charge
for the first run.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.230
I'm gonna call you guys
on the radio

34:27.232 --> 34:30.300
When you're doing
100 miles an hour, all right?

34:30.302 --> 34:31.435
Copy.
Have fun.

34:31.437 --> 34:36.139
It's agreed they'll
start off at a stately 100-per

34:36.141 --> 34:38.542
To get the lay of the land.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.376
It's fast.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.143
Logan warms up the tires,

34:41.146 --> 34:44.414
Shakes Adam around
like a strawberry daiquiri,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.483
Then gets down to business.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.617
100.

34:47.619 --> 34:52.889
Logan's fast, focused,
and right on target.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.493
perfect.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.794
Right about 100.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.863
Did we go
right over the manhole cover?

34:59.865 --> 35:00.363
I believe so.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.032
Did you see
any movement?

35:02.034 --> 35:03.967
I couldn't see it,
but then it only comes up

35:03.969 --> 35:06.069
About a half an inch
before it's stopped.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.771
It's true.

35:08.506 --> 35:12.742
The key tool in measuring lift
is the force meter,

35:12.744 --> 35:15.812
And they just can't go on
without sneaking a peak.

35:15.814 --> 35:16.780
Nope, it's totally blank.

35:16.782 --> 35:21.718
It's a rare myth
that has to suck to succeed,

35:21.720 --> 35:22.552
And this is one of the them.

35:22.554 --> 35:26.723
The aim now is for logan
to crank up the speed to 150.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.426
Hey, Adam, I can try one
from the end of the runway,

35:29.428 --> 35:31.228
See if we can get
a bit more speed.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.163
Let's do it.

35:33.999 --> 35:37.367
With Adam latched tight
to his hch,

35:37.369 --> 35:42.439
Logan whips the horses
up to a full gallop.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.211
140.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.648
149.

35:53.618 --> 35:56.253
You're getting faster.
149.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.254
Beautiful.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.389
Shall we go look
at the evidence?

35:59.391 --> 36:01.825
Let's go look
at the evidence.

36:01.827 --> 36:05.295
All right. My favorite part --
high-speed review.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.863
I'm not seeing it.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.599
Nothing.
Absolute nothing.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.234
It did not budge.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.269
Nope.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.071
Well.
That's pretty definitive.

36:15.073 --> 36:15.605
I think so.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.541
We had our clear manhole cover

36:17.543 --> 36:19.676
Weighing the same
as a cast-iron manhole cover,

36:19.678 --> 36:23.146
And logan passed over it
several times at a top speed

36:23.148 --> 36:25.315
Of almost 150 miles an hour.

36:25.317 --> 36:28.818
And how much movement did we see
on it? Bubkes.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.487
Now, we're gonna pull
all the weight from it

36:30.489 --> 36:32.055
So our manhole cover
only weighs 30 pounds

36:32.057 --> 36:34.524
And see if we can get anything
at all out of this.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.160
And there is
some science here to salvage.

36:37.162 --> 36:41.231
30 pounds is the weight
of an average, flat-screen tv.

36:41.233 --> 36:44.201
And try lifting that
with your home vacuum cleaner.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.304
That's a lot like what Adam
and logan are trying now

36:47.306 --> 36:50.340
With the natural suction
of a low-slung race car.

36:50.342 --> 36:56.813
Whatever happens, this will be
the day's last Indy drag race.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.922
Well, that was a good speed.
It was 148.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.757
It's right up there
with your top.

37:07.759 --> 37:08.959
Bingo!

37:08.961 --> 37:10.193
Let's see what we got.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.661
Let's see it.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.430
I'm gonna need some help
getting out.

37:13.432 --> 37:18.068
Finally, the cameras
confirm a belated liftoff.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.236
Oh, oh, oh!
Movement!

37:19.238 --> 37:23.473
That is so cool.
Yep! It is lifting.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.407
It is totally lifting.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.809
Yep.
Came right up.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.578
That is awesome.
Let's check the force gauge.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.946
Okay.

37:32.850 --> 37:33.750
37.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.018
37?
37 pounds.

37:35.020 --> 37:38.121
It would have been enough
to lift this out of the ground,

37:38.123 --> 37:39.689
But only just.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.259
Well, here's the thing.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.928
It did pull up
our plastic manhole cover,

37:44.930 --> 37:46.062
And that weighs 30 pounds,

37:46.064 --> 37:50.166
Which means
it's not exactly a paper bag.

37:50.168 --> 37:52.168
But then, it's also not exactly

37:52.170 --> 37:54.571
A cast-iron manhole cover,
is it?

37:54.573 --> 37:56.539
I got to say
I am disappointed,

37:56.541 --> 37:58.441
With all of
our small-scale tests

37:58.443 --> 38:00.543
Showing that there was
definitely a force

38:00.545 --> 38:02.279
Trying to lift
that manhole cover.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.614
And we did see
a significant amount of lift

38:04.616 --> 38:05.448
On the lighter manhole cover,

38:05.450 --> 38:10.186
But it wasn't enough to pull up
the full-sized, 130-pound one,

38:10.188 --> 38:12.289
And not
with a 150-mile-an-hour car.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.491
It's busted.
Yep. It's busted.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.959
Let's go.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.369
Surely, you've heard of
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,

38:26.371 --> 38:28.471
And not only
because james franklin Hyneman

38:28.473 --> 38:30.040
Was born
only 50 miles from here,

38:30.042 --> 38:31.641
For it's 2 1/2-mile oval

38:31.643 --> 38:33.910
Is one of the most famous
in the racing world.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.647
What you might not know
is that this seating complex

38:37.649 --> 38:42.218
Is the largest on our planet,
seating up to 250,000 people

38:42.220 --> 38:45.689
With standing room
for 50,000 more --

38:45.691 --> 38:46.756
300,000 total.

38:46.758 --> 38:50.126
Even though it's empty,
you can hear them screaming...

38:50.128 --> 38:52.228
"Science, science"...

38:52.230 --> 38:57.434
Because today, this complex
is ours for the testing.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.907
So far, on our IndyCar
special, we've seen sweat...

39:03.909 --> 39:08.845
I am exhausted, and I feel
sweaty as I could possibly be.

39:08.847 --> 39:09.746
...Spills...

39:10.649 --> 39:14.217
Goodness gracious, that's fast.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.252
...And, most of all, speed.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.389
You're getting faster.
149.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.290
But there's one fast fable

39:20.292 --> 39:22.425
They haven't seen through
to the checkered flag.

39:22.427 --> 39:26.463
The 30-foot match race
between man and car

39:26.465 --> 39:31.234
Is about to be rerun
with some serious sports talent.

39:31.236 --> 39:31.835
Let's tally up.

39:31.837 --> 39:35.138
When I was driving the race car,
I beat Jamie three out of three.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.373
When he was driving
the race car,

39:36.375 --> 39:39.242
He beat me two out of three
with one tie.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.811
Neither of us
is a professional driver.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.580
Neither of us
is a professional runner.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.549
I think we need one of each
to continue this test.

39:46.551 --> 39:50.553
Lining up for the showdown are
two the speediest guys on earth.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.723
Ryan Briscoe's the man
who will be driving this home.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.158
As for the runner, well,

39:55.160 --> 40:00.096
Only six men in history
have run a faster 200 meters.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.932
You may recognize our runner
for today's episode,

40:02.934 --> 40:03.500
Wallace Spearmon.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.969
He's not only the seventh
fastest man on the planet,

40:05.971 --> 40:09.506
Being the 2012 200-meter
olympic trials champion,

40:09.508 --> 40:12.108
But he's also been on an episode
of "Mythbusters" before.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.977
We asked him
to run on the water,

40:13.979 --> 40:17.680
Something it turns out,
surprisingly, humans can't do.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.582
I don't think it's working,
guys.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.750
Try harder.

40:20.752 --> 40:25.021
Today, we are asking him
to do another superhuman feat,

40:25.023 --> 40:26.589
Race himself against an IndyCar.

40:26.591 --> 40:30.660
I don't mind telling you Wallace
is a little nervous about it.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.429
Won't lose to no stinking car.

40:32.431 --> 40:35.265
A car?
I'm faster than a car.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.566
I got this.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.502
Now to find out
if upping the talent quotient

40:39.504 --> 40:40.904
Will swing the result.

40:40.906 --> 40:45.175
All right, gentlemen!
On your marks!

40:45.177 --> 40:46.476
Get set!

40:47.878 --> 40:50.713
Go!

40:50.715 --> 40:51.314
Aah!

40:51.316 --> 40:52.882
That was close.

40:54.685 --> 40:56.886
Do you think you beat him there?
I'm not sure.

40:56.888 --> 41:00.657
Mm, probably the first 10, 15,
but he kind of caught me,

41:00.659 --> 41:02.926
So I'm about to go out,
change a few things.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.327
I think
I can get him, though.

41:04.329 --> 41:08.198
Round 1 went to Ryan with that
familiar, flying finish.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.235
But Wallace
is just getting warmed up.

41:15.739 --> 41:16.639
I can't tell who won!

41:16.641 --> 41:20.777
In test two, they both got off
to a whip-crack start,

41:20.779 --> 41:25.014
But 30 feet on, it's another
come-from-the-clouds win

41:25.016 --> 41:25.748
For the car.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.016
I just don't like losing.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.419
Good, good! Let's keep
that energy for the last run.

41:29.421 --> 41:30.220
I got you.
All right.

41:30.222 --> 41:34.057
Unless Wallace
gets off to a near-perfect start

41:34.059 --> 41:38.428
In the last race, this myth
is about to be roadkill.

41:38.430 --> 41:41.965
Maybe the smart thing to do
is to rethink his tactics.

41:41.967 --> 41:42.832
What's going on,
Wallace?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.735
I'm not really known for my
block start. I think I'd
be quicker without them.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.404
It's all about that first start.
You got to get an edge on him.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.740
Definitely.
I'm gonna need something.

41:50.742 --> 41:51.674
He sure is.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.676
Even though Wallace
makes Jamie and Adam

41:53.678 --> 41:55.078
Look like
they're running backwards,

41:55.080 --> 41:59.315
Ryan's also putting their
"Miss Daisy" driving to shame.

41:59.317 --> 42:02.051
His last run
was just 1.48 seconds,

42:02.053 --> 42:04.854
While the boys' best
was 2 seconds dead.

42:04.856 --> 42:08.625
Now it's pro versus pro
for the very last time.

42:08.627 --> 42:12.629
All right, gentlemen!
On your marks!

42:12.631 --> 42:15.064
Get set!

42:16.033 --> 42:18.434
Go!

42:21.672 --> 42:24.374
Car beat him.

42:24.376 --> 42:25.141
Man.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.377
I haven't got beat like that
since kindergarten.

42:27.379 --> 42:30.680
It's a three-from-three wipeout
for Wallace,

42:30.682 --> 42:35.051
But he <i>can</i> tell his friends
that he's raced at Indianapolis.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.486
According to our experts,

42:36.488 --> 42:39.289
You can put out
about a horsepower at max

42:39.291 --> 42:39.889
For an impulse.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.725
So, one horsepower,
700 horsepower --

42:42.727 --> 42:44.494
That's not much of a contest,
I guess.

42:44.496 --> 42:45.895
It's not much of a thing,
right?

42:45.897 --> 42:47.297
It shouldn't be as close
as it is.

42:47.299 --> 42:51.034
And close it was
from the very beginning.

42:51.036 --> 42:54.671
So, why is that we came
closer to beating an IndyCar

42:54.673 --> 42:55.672
Than Wallace did?

42:55.674 --> 42:56.506
Well, let me tell you

42:56.508 --> 42:58.908
It's not because we're faster
than Wallace.

42:58.910 --> 43:02.745
The fact is that we're
obviously not as experienced

43:02.747 --> 43:04.681
At driving them as Ryan is.

43:04.683 --> 43:05.481
Let's just leave it at that.

43:05.483 --> 43:10.253
And the last 10 feet, that's
where it all is, isn't it?

43:10.255 --> 43:10.753
Yeah.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.422
In a 24 race,
it's a dead heat.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.490
We should try that next time.

43:14.492 --> 43:18.394
Maybe even, like, at five or 10.
Something I can run.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.201
You want more?

43:25.203 --> 43:25.835
We've got more.
