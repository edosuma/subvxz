00:14.000 --> 00:16.500
Aw, gee, pluto.
Cheer up!

00:16.500 --> 00:18.375
The doctor said that you
only have to wear that cone

00:18.375 --> 00:20.792
for a few days until the stitches heal.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.458
Wait right here.

00:29.208 --> 00:32.000
Tada!
Now we both have cones!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.792
We'll do this together.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.625
Boy this thing kind of
limits the ol' vision, huh?

00:37.625 --> 00:40.208
Oh well. No big deal. Who's hungry?

00:40.500 --> 00:41.500
Orgh?

00:47.041 --> 00:48.125
There we go...

00:48.125 --> 00:49.208
Whooo... whooaaaaa!

00:51.667 --> 00:54.000
Okay! My turn.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.250
Ooh!

01:08.875 --> 01:10.333
Mouse residence.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.291
Oh...

01:12.291 --> 01:13.709
Helloo?

01:13.709 --> 01:14.834
Ow!

01:18.125 --> 01:20.291
A-hh, guess they hung up.

01:20.291 --> 01:23.875
You know, maybe what we
need is just a little fresh air.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.834
What?
Sounds like thunder,

01:38.834 --> 01:41.250
but there isn't a cloud in the sky.

01:43.583 --> 01:44.917
Hey, easy!

01:44.917 --> 01:46.125
If you didn't want to go for a walk,

01:46.125 --> 01:47.875
you could have just said so.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.500
Let's see.
What else can we do?

01:54.125 --> 01:55.542
Well, we made it!

01:57.000 --> 01:59.291
Let's go get these cones off!

02:04.875 --> 02:06.542
Woof woof woof arf
arf arf! Woof woof woof!

02:07.500 --> 02:10.166
I know, boy.
I'm excited too.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.291
And away we go!

02:13.291 --> 02:15.375
Woof woof!
Woof woof woof woof!

02:16.583 --> 02:18.500
Woof woof woof!

02:24.291 --> 02:25.542
Whooorrr!

02:25.542 --> 02:26.667
Aaaghhh!

02:26.667 --> 02:28.041
Aaahh!

02:30.333 --> 02:31.375
Unnnggh!

02:40.166 --> 02:41.542
Arf arf arf arf!

02:57.792 --> 02:59.250
Hmph!

03:02.250 --> 03:03.792
Welp, I guess we're here.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.041
Congratulations gentlemen.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.208
You can finally take these cones off.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.667
Unfortunately, you now have
to wear these wheelie carts

03:14.667 --> 03:17.375
until your shattered legs heal.

03:17.792 --> 03:20.166
Well, hey, this isn't so bad.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.375
At least we're in it together.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.250
Come on!
Race ya home!

03:24.625 --> 03:25.625
Whoa!

03:25.625 --> 03:27.458
Oh! Ah!
Ugh! Ah! Oh! Ah!
