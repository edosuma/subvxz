WEBVTT

00:03.935 --> 00:06.926
ER

00:06.927 --> 00:08.245
Previously, on ER...

00:08.246 --> 00:09.680
Dr. Green, excuse me!

00:09.681 --> 00:12.447
I've done quite a few more
ER procedures than she has.

00:12.448 --> 00:14.323
I used to sell vitamins over the phone.

00:14.324 --> 00:16.437
That's kind of
in the health field, isn't it?

00:16.438 --> 00:19.058
You just want your boy
to have your last name.

00:19.059 --> 00:20.059
So, what's wrong?

00:20.060 --> 00:22.538
- How's your busy social calendar?
- It's not as busy.

00:22.539 --> 00:25.025
This is Elizabeth Corday,
new surgical resident.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.641
It's a pleasure.

00:26.642 --> 00:29.398
Maybe it would be best if I stepped in
and took over some of the...

00:29.869 --> 00:32.746
...administrative duties
while you're recuperating.

00:33.211 --> 00:34.835
God bless you, Kerry Weaver.

00:34.836 --> 00:37.059
- You got the job.
- What?

00:38.258 --> 00:41.284
"Freindly Fire"

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.096 --> 00:54.965
Hold it. Hold it!

00:57.010 --> 00:58.680
Thanks.

00:58.888 --> 01:02.310
- It's five minutes by car.
-15 minutes on the El.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.942
- You're not enjoying this?
- No. Should I?

01:06.151 --> 01:08.864
It's a secret romance.
It's what sells bad novels.

01:09.072 --> 01:11.243
This shouldn't be a bad novel.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.872
That's my train.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.297
- Yeah, get that. See you at work.
- Bye.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.888
He continues to gain weight
and he's spending more time awake.

01:23.097 --> 01:26.019
- What about his lungs?
- He's down to a quarter liter.

01:26.227 --> 01:30.109
- So when can he come home?
- I'd say a week or less.

01:30.735 --> 01:34.198
You hear that, pumpkin?
You're gonna come home in a week.

01:34.408 --> 01:37.120
Isn't that premature?
What about his immune system?

01:37.288 --> 01:40.168
I think there's more risk of
nosocomial infection here.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.755
Should he be circumcised
before he comes home?

01:42.922 --> 01:44.718
That's what my mother told me.

01:45.594 --> 01:48.015
Dr. Tabash and I decided against it.

01:48.473 --> 01:49.809
Isn't it healthier?

01:49.977 --> 01:52.689
Some studies indicate that
circumcision prevents UTls...

01:53.065 --> 01:55.068
...and may reduce the risk of cancer.

01:55.277 --> 01:57.698
Yeah, I don't find
those studies conclusive.

01:57.906 --> 02:00.077
I'll just teach him proper hygiene.

02:00.244 --> 02:01.704
I don't wanna take any risk.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.210
Dr. Tabash, what about immunization?

02:05.420 --> 02:08.633
After discharge.
With OPV he could shed virus.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.515
I don't want the immuno-suppressed
children here at risk.

02:12.724 --> 02:14.267
I got a thymectomy.

02:14.477 --> 02:16.188
Peter, what about the circumcision?

02:16.646 --> 02:18.859
Honey, he doesn't need one.

02:21.823 --> 02:23.241
- Morning, Doug.
- Mark.

02:23.450 --> 02:25.454
You don't wear scrubs
to work anymore?

02:25.662 --> 02:31.047
I got tired of having people hit me up
for a diagnosis in line at Starbucks.

02:31.213 --> 02:34.595
Dr. Greene, there's an explosive
diarrhea in Exam 4.

02:34.803 --> 02:36.974
- What's Weaver doing?
- She's not in yet.

02:37.183 --> 02:39.812
See if Del Amico can take it.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.787
- They made me pay $ 1000-
- Shut up!

02:59.638 --> 03:03.518
The decision to appoint you
Acting Chief of Emergency Services...

03:03.727 --> 03:07.150
...did not come simply because
Dr. Morgenstern recommended you.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.904
Of course.

03:10.823 --> 03:15.164
In fact, many feel Dr. Morgenstern's
approach to management...

03:15.372 --> 03:18.211
...is not something
we wish to see perpetuated.

03:18.377 --> 03:21.467
With all due respect
to Dr. Morgenstern, I agree.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.553
I know we're way beyond our budget.

03:23.763 --> 03:26.015
1.7 million over last year.

03:26.183 --> 03:28.979
We are in a crisis situation.

03:29.146 --> 03:31.192
And that's why I've drafted this.

03:31.359 --> 03:33.655
It outlines measures
that if applied now...

03:33.863 --> 03:36.493
...would put us back on budget
within six months.

03:36.701 --> 03:39.498
So much waste is simply due
to lax administration.

03:39.665 --> 03:42.002
Well, you've never
struck me as lax, Kerry.

03:42.169 --> 03:46.051
And this job is not about
winning popularity contests.

03:46.218 --> 03:48.221
That's never been my goal, Donald.

03:48.430 --> 03:49.515
Just Don.

03:50.516 --> 03:55.399
There will be a reevaluation
when Dr. Morgenstern recovers.

03:55.608 --> 03:58.948
But I'm confident
that you'll make things work.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.619
Thank you for your trust.

04:06.752 --> 04:07.796
Yes!

04:59.717 --> 05:02.975
Hi. I'm Cynthia Hooper.
I think they called from Personnel.

05:03.142 --> 05:04.935
- Sure. Hi.
- Hi.

05:05.102 --> 05:09.360
I'm Jerry, the Unit Service Coordinator.
I'll be training you.

05:09.569 --> 05:11.029
Come on around.

05:12.407 --> 05:14.618
Cynthia, this is Nurse Haleh Adams.

05:14.827 --> 05:18.208
- Dr. Ross, Cynthia, my new assistant.
- How are you?

05:18.710 --> 05:21.673
Nurse Hathaway, hi!
Well, here I am.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.467
Yeah, hi.

05:25.388 --> 05:28.518
Cynthia Hooper, remember?
You interviewed me?

05:28.768 --> 05:29.894
Yes, I did.

05:30.104 --> 05:33.151
- Anyone seen Mark?
- Check in the lounge.

05:33.359 --> 05:36.072
So let's start you
on some basic procedure.

05:37.324 --> 05:39.119
Anything interesting, Dr. Carter?

05:39.327 --> 05:41.623
Thought I'd take a look
at this cellulitis.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.880
Cases will now be taken in order.
No more cherry-picking.

05:45.046 --> 05:46.716
Here's an old lady, weak and dizzy.

05:46.883 --> 05:49.888
- Jerry, have you paged my med student?
- Yes. I paged him twice.

05:50.055 --> 05:54.228
Anna, there's a patient in 3 if you wanna
teach your student ulcer débridement.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.065
- Thanks, Maggie.
- Sure.

05:56.232 --> 06:01.073
Haleh, I'd like each nurse to get
a copy of these policy changes today.

06:05.498 --> 06:09.463
- Did Personnel get the wrong name?
- I picked her. She'll be fine.

06:09.672 --> 06:11.592
Fine? Mark, she was a disaster.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.387
She has no experience that
matches the job description.

06:14.556 --> 06:18.770
I considered the other candidates
and she was the best of the lot.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.317
Well, we could always interview
more candidates.

06:21.525 --> 06:22.944
It wasn't necessary.

06:23.153 --> 06:27.995
After the interview, she explained to me
she was just having a bad day.

06:28.203 --> 06:31.584
- A bad day?
- Don't worry. She'll be great.

06:33.379 --> 06:34.423
What?

06:34.590 --> 06:38.554
New Chief of Emergency Services
has decided to change some policy.

06:38.763 --> 06:40.600
No shift overlapping? What's that?

06:40.808 --> 06:44.690
If we don't punch out by 7,
she'll do it for us.

06:47.153 --> 06:50.700
- Dr. Del Amico, do you remember me?
- Of course, Carla. How are you?

06:50.909 --> 06:53.997
- I hear the baby's doing great.
- Yeah, he is.

06:54.165 --> 06:57.003
I was wondering if we could talk
when you're finished.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.425
Yeah. Actually, we can talk now.
Old Tim won't mind.

07:00.592 --> 07:02.804
Débriding his ulcer
has a sedative effect.

07:02.971 --> 07:05.476
I've started nursing.
He's coming home in five days.

07:05.643 --> 07:08.022
- That's great.
- Yes, it is. I'm real excited.

07:08.189 --> 07:10.818
Been buying car seats,
baby strollers.

07:11.027 --> 07:14.366
I love those baby shops.
Everything in them is so cute.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.830
I was wondering...
I wanted to ask you a question.

07:18.039 --> 07:20.376
Do you think I should
have him circumcised?

07:20.585 --> 07:22.546
It would be my preference, sure.

07:22.755 --> 07:24.217
Hold on a second.

07:24.383 --> 07:27.514
Débride to here,
then dress it with Tegaderm, okay?

07:30.352 --> 07:32.773
- Is circumcision healthier?
- I recommend it.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.984
It's better for hygiene...

07:35.193 --> 07:38.073
...and between us,
I just like the way it looks.

07:38.239 --> 07:40.619
- Don't let Peter hear you say that.
- Oh, yeah?

07:40.786 --> 07:45.461
Seriously, having it done is
really in your son's best interest.

07:45.669 --> 07:46.713
Could you do it?

07:47.714 --> 07:50.135
Sure. I'll do it today.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.725
Hey, I heard a Le Fort lll
facial fracture came in.

07:53.892 --> 07:57.273
Dr. Doyle gave it to Dr. Del Amico.
She's with the surgeon now.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.859
Coming through!

07:59.068 --> 08:00.612
I got it!

08:02.031 --> 08:04.911
41-year-old male,
motorcycle versus delivery truck.

08:05.119 --> 08:08.626
Blunt trauma to chest and abdomen.
BP 110/70. Pulse 110.

08:08.793 --> 08:11.130
We couldn't get a line.
He's a tough stick.

08:11.339 --> 08:13.551
Okay! Follow me to Trauma 2.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.224
On my count, everybody.
One, two, three.

08:17.432 --> 08:20.145
CBC, Chem-7,
type and cross for four.

08:20.354 --> 08:22.691
Let's get a portable C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.321
No kidding, "tough stick. "
Nothing but track marks.

08:25.488 --> 08:27.199
I'll slide around you, Conni.

08:28.577 --> 08:32.833
Right upper tenderness with guarding.
Get an abdominal CT with contrast.

08:33.083 --> 08:36.131
- I can't get a vein.
- I got one.

08:36.465 --> 08:38.094
Damn, it blew!

08:38.302 --> 08:41.057
Last time they had to stick
through the deep vein.

08:41.265 --> 08:42.808
Give me a central line kit.

08:43.017 --> 08:44.688
- What do you got?
- I got it.

08:44.896 --> 08:46.023
I'd like to hear it.

08:46.190 --> 08:49.112
41-year-old male,
motorcycle versus delivery truck...

08:49.320 --> 08:53.202
...right upper tenderness. I ordered
a CT and am putting in a central line.

08:53.370 --> 08:56.374
Anna'll take it. You do sutures.
Where's your student?

08:56.583 --> 09:00.214
- Come on. I already started.
- Carter! Sutures.

09:06.267 --> 09:10.399
Started a saline. Vitals are stable.
Estimated blood loss, 300 cc's.

09:10.566 --> 09:13.195
He's gotten 800 cc's in so far.

09:13.404 --> 09:15.198
Al? Al?

09:15.366 --> 09:16.409
What happened?

09:16.576 --> 09:20.291
Clutch slipped and the cart knocked
me and Bill into a ditch. I'm fine.

09:20.457 --> 09:21.710
Just a little dirty.

09:21.876 --> 09:24.548
Don't worry. We've taken
harder knocks playing one-on-one.

09:24.715 --> 09:26.342
All right. Come here.

09:27.887 --> 09:29.389
What do you need?

09:29.556 --> 09:31.226
Prednisone.

09:31.685 --> 09:34.773
This med room really
needs reorganization.

09:35.108 --> 09:39.072
- Why don't you write a prescription?
- He only needs seven.

09:39.406 --> 09:42.202
We can't keep giving away
our pharmacy stock.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.206
I was reviewing our records...

09:44.415 --> 09:49.047
...and noticed that your salary's paid by
Emergency Medicine and not Pediatrics.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.760
Morgenstern and Bernstein
worked it out.

09:51.927 --> 09:54.682
Doesn't that mean the ER
is underwriting your fellowship?

09:54.891 --> 09:56.894
For which they get my full services.

09:57.061 --> 09:59.274
Morgenstern thinks
it's a two-way street.

09:59.441 --> 10:01.485
Morgenstern is not in charge now.

10:01.694 --> 10:06.077
What's the nature of your fellowship?
I could review your research proposal.

10:06.286 --> 10:07.455
Sure.

10:07.872 --> 10:10.793
- Can you get me a copy today?
- If I can find one.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.589
You're needed in Trauma 1.

10:12.755 --> 10:14.090
Thanks.

10:15.469 --> 10:18.599
Yes, this is Dr. Carter calling again.
Could Henry page me?

10:18.807 --> 10:23.398
Actually, don't have him page me.
Have him come to the ER.

10:23.649 --> 10:25.694
Because he's doing a clerkship!

10:25.903 --> 10:28.324
That's right, he's on duty.
He's on duty.

10:28.907 --> 10:32.831
Dr. Greene. Dr. Doyle pulled me off of
a trauma this morning to cover sutures.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.169
I don't think that's the best
use of my time.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.506
Maybe she thought
she was more qualified.

10:37.715 --> 10:40.720
She didn't do it.
She gave it to Dr. Del Amico.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.891
Which has become standard procedure.

10:43.099 --> 10:45.269
The suture room
is the intern's place...

10:45.479 --> 10:48.609
...unless you can get your student
to carry the load.

10:48.775 --> 10:51.112
- Anna, how's your student doing?
- She's a gem.

10:51.279 --> 10:52.741
There you go.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.665
Hello? Hello?

10:58.751 --> 11:01.547
Hello? Henry, is that you?

11:02.299 --> 11:04.720
- It's this hallway.
- Be careful with that.

11:04.887 --> 11:08.017
- I don't use this around patients.
- I don't mean that.

11:08.225 --> 11:12.149
I know this guy who got one free.
The first month, his bill was 300 bucks.

11:12.358 --> 11:14.653
Well, I limit my calls.

11:14.862 --> 11:16.824
Plus you can write it off
on your taxes.

11:17.033 --> 11:20.288
Right. So it's like
an "economy move. "

11:21.372 --> 11:23.919
It's not bad. I'll clean it up
then suture it.

11:24.128 --> 11:26.591
- I guess we lucked out, huh, Bill?
- Oh, yeah.

11:26.799 --> 11:30.305
- Where did all this blood come from?
- It's Al's, from when he fell on me.

11:36.942 --> 11:41.450
I knew it would tear me up.
But I had to grab the cable.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.912
Can you move your fingers?

11:45.498 --> 11:46.792
That's good.

11:47.292 --> 11:49.755
That's good.
Have you had a tetanus shot?

11:50.380 --> 11:51.592
Yeah.

11:53.135 --> 11:54.806
About a year ago.

11:55.014 --> 11:58.436
- Are you allergic to any drugs?
- None that I know of.

11:58.603 --> 12:01.024
Hey, there's my guy.

12:01.234 --> 12:02.985
How's the hero?

12:03.237 --> 12:04.656
How's it look?

12:04.864 --> 12:07.202
They'll fix you up.
They can fix anybody up.

12:07.410 --> 12:10.082
You know, this man saved two lives.

12:10.624 --> 12:12.293
How are those guys?

12:12.502 --> 12:14.631
They got away without a scratch.

12:14.881 --> 12:17.761
Listen, Casey, I want
to take care of you on this.

12:17.969 --> 12:20.015
Whatever this costs, I'll pay for it.

12:20.182 --> 12:22.686
I want everybody working
like we've been working.

12:22.895 --> 12:26.485
But I gotta watch things.
I don't want this on workers' comp.

12:26.693 --> 12:28.948
I don't know how bad
this is gonna be.

12:29.156 --> 12:32.453
What are we talking about here?
Some stitches? A cast?

12:32.620 --> 12:33.705
Maybe surgery.

12:33.872 --> 12:36.961
You put it on your health insurance.
I pick up the rest.

12:37.169 --> 12:39.257
And I keep you
on the employment rolls.

12:39.465 --> 12:42.804
I don't know how my hands
are gonna work after this.

12:43.848 --> 12:46.227
You know what this'll cost me
on workers' comp?

12:47.062 --> 12:50.025
Without workers' comp,
he won't qualify for disability.

12:51.069 --> 12:52.987
Suddenly nurses know everything.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.827
I'm gonna go make some calls.

13:01.086 --> 13:04.550
I had an interesting wound
this morning. A linoleum knife.

13:04.716 --> 13:06.512
The cut was as clean
as a scalpel's.

13:07.138 --> 13:09.767
Carter, can you take a case
for me? I'm swamped.

13:09.976 --> 13:11.186
Sure.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.736
Hey, Chasity?
Dress that for me, would you?

13:17.196 --> 13:19.575
27-year-old woman,
altered consciousness.

13:19.784 --> 13:21.871
No trauma.
Her husband brought her in.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.624
Thanks, Anna.

13:24.041 --> 13:28.800
Mr. Toren? I'm Dr. Carter.
I'll be taking care of your wife.

13:28.967 --> 13:32.807
Last night she was fine,
but I couldn't wake her up this morning.

13:33.015 --> 13:36.521
- Could she have hit her head somehow?
- I don't think so.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.321
Did she complain earlier
about having a headache?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.367
Fever? Nausea?

13:43.534 --> 13:45.035
No, nothing. She was fine.

13:45.245 --> 13:47.290
Heart and lungs are normal.
That's good.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.627
She's not having
any trouble breathing.

13:49.836 --> 13:51.922
Kirsty, honey, can you hear me?

13:52.424 --> 13:54.969
For God's sake, baby,
what's wrong?

13:56.014 --> 13:57.599
Please, just wake up.

13:58.017 --> 14:00.813
Pupils are in mid-position and fixed.

14:08.285 --> 14:11.123
Corneal reflexes still intact.
That's good.

14:11.665 --> 14:13.209
What are you doing?

14:13.710 --> 14:17.509
Seeing if eye movement adjusts
to changes in head position.

14:17.718 --> 14:20.389
It'll tell us if there's
brainstem involvement.

14:33.619 --> 14:34.997
No doll's-eye response.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.585
- What does that mean?
- It's too early to tell.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.798
I want to check some labs
and do a head CT.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.386
Wait in the waiting room,
and I'll keep you posted.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.891
It's bad isn't it? I can tell.

14:46.057 --> 14:48.770
We won't know anything
until we run the tests.

14:49.188 --> 14:53.320
Do whatever you have to. Anything.
I have really good insurance.

14:53.862 --> 14:55.199
Please?

15:09.389 --> 15:12.019
Excuse me.
Where's the Benton baby?

15:12.227 --> 15:14.147
- Reece?
- Yeah. No, Benton.

15:14.356 --> 15:17.779
- Reece-Benton? The procedure room.
- Okay.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.161
Whoa! Wait! What are you doing?

15:22.328 --> 15:23.914
I'm circumcising him.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.667
No, I don't want him circumcised.

15:25.876 --> 15:28.671
You don't want me
to leave it half done, do you?

15:28.923 --> 15:30.050
There.

15:31.343 --> 15:33.597
I didn't want this.
Who gave you permission?

15:33.805 --> 15:36.811
Can you open up the xeroform gauze?
His mother.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.192
- She had no right to.
- I'm sorry. I assumed it was agreed.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.779
No, it wasn't.

15:41.987 --> 15:45.993
Well, this isn't between you and I.
This is between you and Carla.

15:46.202 --> 15:47.622
And it's done.

15:47.830 --> 15:51.127
- Let's get him back into the crib.
- No, I got him.

15:51.336 --> 15:53.422
Come here. Come here.

15:53.631 --> 15:57.472
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come here. Come here.

16:19.677 --> 16:22.014
Edema of the brainstem.
Probably an infarct.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.559
That'd go along with the symptoms
you described.

16:24.768 --> 16:27.689
- How did she respond to sternal rub?
- Withdrawal.

16:27.898 --> 16:29.401
All right. Let's see.

16:33.407 --> 16:35.912
She's decerebrating now.

16:36.831 --> 16:40.587
I don't think it'll be long before
she goes into full respiratory arrest.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.091
She's 27 years old.

16:43.258 --> 16:46.430
- Any family members around?
- Her husband. He's in shock.

16:46.598 --> 16:48.308
He doesn't know what to think.

16:48.518 --> 16:51.147
Be sure you talk to him
about organ donation.

16:55.028 --> 16:58.368
They'll be taking you up to X-ray soon.
How's the pain?

16:58.576 --> 17:02.333
Okay, since whatever they're
giving me through that tube.

17:02.542 --> 17:05.421
Better living through chemistry, huh?

17:05.630 --> 17:09.095
I'm sorry we had to cut your shirt
to pieces to get it off.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.974
Time for a new one anyway.

17:12.349 --> 17:14.813
With my first disability check.

17:17.358 --> 17:18.694
Is this yours?

17:21.657 --> 17:23.996
No, officer. Not mine.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.624
Did you smoke this today?

17:27.291 --> 17:29.212
Never saw it before.

17:30.171 --> 17:32.926
You were operating dangerous
machinery. Men were hurt.

17:33.136 --> 17:37.059
Men are alive because I grabbed
a running cable, lady.

17:37.476 --> 17:40.524
Because I tore my hands to shreds.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.028
You can smoke it...

17:44.196 --> 17:46.492
...or stick it
where the sun don't shine.

17:47.034 --> 17:49.205
I told you it's not mine.

17:50.833 --> 17:55.215
All right. I'll just ask your boss.
Maybe he dropped it.

17:57.635 --> 17:58.722
Dr. Greene.

17:58.888 --> 18:01.267
- How's your first day?
- She's doing great.

18:01.476 --> 18:03.521
We're just starting lab requisitions.

18:03.730 --> 18:06.818
I'm so lucky. After my interview,
I didn't think I had a chance.

18:06.985 --> 18:09.114
- What happened?
- A disaster. I cried.

18:13.580 --> 18:17.128
- We're glad that you're here.
- Thanks.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.635
- Hi.
- Heather!

18:21.844 --> 18:24.724
I left you a message
about the Sports Medicine dinner.

18:24.891 --> 18:27.103
And I left a message
that I couldn't make it.

18:27.270 --> 18:31.360
Well, you sounded a little vague,
so I'm giving it a face-to-face try.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.240
It's such a coup if I show up
with a handsome doctor.

18:34.449 --> 18:36.494
And you couldn't
find anyone else?

18:36.661 --> 18:37.705
Okay, busted.

18:37.872 --> 18:42.464
I already bragged I was bringing you.
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

18:42.672 --> 18:44.591
I'm sorry. Tonight I just can't.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.307
Is it me or the event?
I mean, does "no" mean "never"?

18:48.515 --> 18:49.641
No. Just tonight-

18:49.851 --> 18:51.979
There's a truck outside.
Someone's hurt.

18:52.146 --> 18:53.982
- I should check this out.
- Okay.

18:54.735 --> 18:57.029
A lot of blood.
Could be an arterial injury.

18:57.238 --> 18:59.575
- Grab some lap pads.
- Get a pressure dressing.

18:59.784 --> 19:02.205
He shot himself in the leg
ejecting a clip.

19:02.414 --> 19:05.377
Glenda, take the ordnance.
Lock the ammo in the back.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.089
You can't take weapons in there.

19:07.256 --> 19:09.383
I can't leave our best stock
in the truck.

19:09.551 --> 19:10.595
Give it to me.

19:10.762 --> 19:14.602
- Jer, keep these safe, man.
- Jerry, we're going to Trauma 2.

19:14.810 --> 19:16.354
- Glenda.
- I'm here, honey.

19:16.521 --> 19:19.150
- Did you secure the weapons, baby?
- Yes, baby, I did.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.324
We were on our way to a gun show
to set up a booth.

19:22.532 --> 19:24.117
Glenda, come close.

19:25.286 --> 19:27.582
Don't let them take the leg.

19:27.790 --> 19:29.878
Don't let them, Glenda.

19:32.966 --> 19:36.221
- It was about his health.
- My son's health is always on my mind.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.599
- Our son!
- What?

19:37.766 --> 19:39.853
You can't divide his life
into categories.

19:40.062 --> 19:42.191
Say, "I'll do health
and you do diapers. " No.

19:42.399 --> 19:44.737
You hide behind medicine
so we don't talk.

19:44.904 --> 19:48.743
- Carla, we're talking now.
- This isn't a conversation.

19:50.371 --> 19:52.666
Because you don't care
what I think or feel.

19:54.087 --> 19:58.510
I may not be your choice for the mother
of your child, but we have to share.

19:58.718 --> 20:01.223
Like you shared in the circumcision?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.312
I was mad.

20:06.608 --> 20:08.068
Come clean, Peter.

20:08.276 --> 20:13.410
Your attitude is not about his health.
It's that you want him to look like you.

20:13.577 --> 20:15.748
So what if I do? Carla, he's my son.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.503
Then why didn't you say that?
I understand that.

20:18.711 --> 20:23.219
Instead of you blowing medical steam
that don't make no damn sense.

20:24.847 --> 20:29.480
Carla, what happened to that boy's penis
should have been left up to me.

20:32.819 --> 20:37.160
This type of stroke can happen to
anybody. It might be congenital.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.453
It's so unfair.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.334
But as long as she's still alive,
there's hope, right?

20:41.501 --> 20:45.215
As the swelling increases,
it may affect her ability to breathe.

20:45.423 --> 20:48.888
Then the question becomes whether
it's in her best interest...

20:49.097 --> 20:50.683
...to put her on a ventilator.

20:50.891 --> 20:52.227
Let her die?

20:52.435 --> 20:55.357
We can sustain her life
on a respirator.

20:56.443 --> 21:00.032
But the question is,
what kind of life would it be?

21:00.324 --> 21:04.456
I can't believe it's all
just gonna be over like this.

21:10.550 --> 21:14.891
You might think about whether organ
donation is something that she'd want.

21:15.851 --> 21:18.565
Yeah. Yeah.

21:19.732 --> 21:21.444
Kirsten would wanna help people.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.244
Did you see that?

21:27.871 --> 21:31.044
She may move a little bit
from time to time.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.061
Oh, my God, she's talking!
Do you hear her?

21:41.228 --> 21:43.774
Kirsty, honey, can you hear me?

21:45.611 --> 21:47.113
Steve.

21:48.282 --> 21:51.161
Yes. Yes, honey. It's me.

21:52.372 --> 21:54.918
She's coming around! Oh, my God!

21:55.712 --> 21:57.255
She's all right.

22:01.805 --> 22:04.977
- Sinus tach on the scope.
- Entrance wound on the left thigh.

22:05.185 --> 22:07.983
Exit wound by the lateral fibula.
Really torn up.

22:08.150 --> 22:09.818
Get a portable x-ray down here.

22:09.985 --> 22:12.114
- Ed, do you feel this?
- Yeah.

22:12.322 --> 22:14.160
No DP or posterior pulses.

22:14.326 --> 22:16.246
The woman with the stroke is awake.

22:16.413 --> 22:18.000
- What woman?
- The brainstem bleed.

22:18.167 --> 22:20.170
- No. She can't be.
- She is. She's talking.

22:20.337 --> 22:22.089
Go on. I'll call Vascular.

22:22.298 --> 22:25.304
- Did you show me the right CT?
- Yes. She was comatose.

22:25.512 --> 22:30.271
Carter, people with brainstem
infarctions, they don't just wake up.

22:32.357 --> 22:35.321
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.660
- What happened to me?
- That's what we want to determine.

22:39.494 --> 22:41.665
Follow my finger. How do you feel?

22:41.874 --> 22:43.626
She's fine. Look at her.

22:43.835 --> 22:46.089
Fine. Just a little tired.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.344
How long do I have to stay here?

22:49.511 --> 22:51.682
We need to keep you
under observation a while.

22:51.849 --> 22:53.810
- Dr. Carter?
- Excuse me.

22:56.148 --> 22:57.568
See this?

22:58.777 --> 23:00.155
- This little-
- Schmutz?

23:00.323 --> 23:03.870
Could be an aneurysm leak trickled
down and caused the swelling.

23:04.078 --> 23:07.335
- Should we do an LP?
- No, it would be a waste of time.

23:07.543 --> 23:11.049
This could blow.
Let's get an MRl right away, okay?

23:13.636 --> 23:16.767
- Brought some clothes for you.
- Thanks.

23:18.644 --> 23:21.149
Does Bill know you're HIV-positive?

23:24.446 --> 23:25.908
No.

23:26.074 --> 23:28.077
I think you'd better tell him.

23:28.496 --> 23:30.457
My blood didn't get mixed with his.

23:30.624 --> 23:34.379
- You saw he doesn't have a cut.
- He's got some skin abrasions.

23:37.510 --> 23:38.971
Look, Jeanie...

23:39.848 --> 23:43.479
These are working guys. Okay?
It's not like around here.

23:44.565 --> 23:46.860
That gets out, I'll be out of a job.

23:47.070 --> 23:49.698
It was rough telling people here.
But I did it.

23:51.659 --> 23:56.335
He should be tested and put on the
cocktail until his results come back.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.797
- For a few scratches?
- Yeah.

24:02.846 --> 24:06.937
- How long will the x-rays take?
- Depends on how backed up they are.

24:07.145 --> 24:11.611
- Wow. How much is this?
-275 bucks. Here.

24:11.904 --> 24:15.701
Put this up to your shoulder.
Feel the potential.

24:16.035 --> 24:18.373
Last year we sold those to everybody.

24:18.581 --> 24:20.709
You ever hear of Colonel Draht?

24:21.043 --> 24:24.717
He was doing fine work with weapons
training patriots in Texas.

24:25.009 --> 24:26.344
Like that guy from Waco?

24:27.972 --> 24:29.183
What's the range?

24:29.350 --> 24:33.564
That'll chuck a grenade
into an area target at 350 meters.

24:33.732 --> 24:35.860
Buy it! I'll give you a break.

24:36.069 --> 24:38.908
What with Ed hurt and all,
we won't make the gun show.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.872
- Jerry!
- Honey, it's disarmed.

24:43.082 --> 24:47.005
The feds have us hamstrung.
It's illegal to sell usable ordnance.

24:47.214 --> 24:52.138
But if you take that home,
there's a kit for 70 bucks.

24:52.848 --> 24:56.271
My neighbor has this dog
that barks all night, every night.

25:30.914 --> 25:34.503
Damn! I guess Ed
used a kit on that one.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.274
No, I don't belong to any organization.
It was an accident.

25:46.482 --> 25:49.070
You think it's against the law,
look it up.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.864
That is our personal property.

25:51.073 --> 25:54.245
I know my rights
according to your Constitution.

25:54.412 --> 25:55.790
Can you hear me?

25:56.749 --> 25:58.670
How about when I speak like this?

25:58.878 --> 26:01.967
Yes, but the ringing is really loud.

26:04.054 --> 26:05.765
- What?
- It tickles.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.351
Sorry.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.938
The eardrum is intact.

26:10.189 --> 26:12.234
Let me take a look at the other side.

26:12.443 --> 26:15.824
- I hope they're clean, my ears.
- Very clean.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.496
- If the tinnitus continues-
- Tinnitus?

26:19.706 --> 26:21.375
The ringing in your ears.

26:21.584 --> 26:25.800
You may have to see a specialist just
to get your hearing checked, okay?

26:26.801 --> 26:28.137
Thanks.

26:28.930 --> 26:31.142
You know, I feel really safe here.

26:31.392 --> 26:32.937
After today?

26:33.187 --> 26:35.233
I think it's having
all you doctors around.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.903
I don't feel like I'm out there
on my own.

26:38.070 --> 26:40.324
Out there on
"a smile and a shoestring. "

26:40.700 --> 26:43.079
- Isn't that from something?
- Death of a Salesman.

26:43.288 --> 26:44.999
We did it in high school.

26:45.208 --> 26:49.006
My teacher told me I had talent,
but he was trying to get into my pants.

26:49.715 --> 26:51.802
I think I saw that play in college.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.642
It's so sad when that guy
looks back over his life...

26:55.809 --> 26:57.980
...and there's just nothing there.

26:59.523 --> 27:01.068
Yeah.

27:01.694 --> 27:04.616
I better get back to learning codes.
Thanks again.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.160
Sure.

27:08.789 --> 27:10.710
So do we have exposure?

27:10.877 --> 27:14.049
We've mobilized the proximal segment
and have a clean edge.

27:14.215 --> 27:17.388
This is the weapons merchant
who cost us an ambulance?

27:17.597 --> 27:20.226
Damned lucky it won't cost him a leg.

27:22.481 --> 27:24.649
Dr. Corday will assist...

27:25.402 --> 27:28.073
...in anastomosis of the popliteal.

27:28.491 --> 27:32.079
- Five-0 of Prolene on a C-1 needle.
- We normally use six-0.

27:32.247 --> 27:34.249
Five-0 is fine.

27:34.459 --> 27:37.255
What is your preference on procedure,
Miss Corday?

27:37.423 --> 27:40.469
I've had good results with
the triangulation technique of Carel.

27:40.637 --> 27:41.971
Favored among the British.

27:42.139 --> 27:46.980
I worked with British surgeons
on the joint NATO exercise in 1974.

27:47.440 --> 27:52.364
- Tell me, do you know Sir Lyle Sugden?
- Suggy? Yes.

27:52.698 --> 27:55.036
Perhaps you don't know. He's dead.

27:56.205 --> 27:57.290
Great loss.

27:57.457 --> 28:01.296
Rather a relief. Towards the end
he got a bit shaky for slash and dash.

28:01.463 --> 28:04.469
"Slash and dash. "
I love those British terms.

28:04.677 --> 28:07.682
Dr. Benton, suppose Miss Corday
asked you for a "torch. "

28:07.891 --> 28:09.645
What would you give her?

28:09.937 --> 28:11.648
I've taken to saying "flashlight. "

28:11.815 --> 28:15.446
Once in the field hospital, mid-
thoracotomy, we had a power failure.

28:15.905 --> 28:17.867
Sir Lyle yelled, "A torch! A torch! "

28:18.034 --> 28:20.788
I thought he had snapped,
was gonna burn the O.R.

28:21.791 --> 28:25.713
"I say, when we finish we should
break for a cuppa. What, oh? "

28:26.297 --> 28:27.342
Stand back!

28:27.717 --> 28:30.054
- What have you got?
- Laura Quentin, 18.

28:30.262 --> 28:32.225
Upper Gl bleed.

28:32.475 --> 28:35.563
Tachy at 115.
I gave a liter of normal saline.

28:35.772 --> 28:36.858
I know her.

28:37.025 --> 28:38.818
All right! Let's go, everybody!

28:39.027 --> 28:42.242
Ready? Everybody ready?
One, two, three.

28:42.534 --> 28:44.996
Get a CBC, PT,
and type and cross for four.

28:45.205 --> 28:48.460
Probably from repeated vomiting.
She came in for bulimia weeks ago.

28:48.669 --> 28:52.176
- Why wasn't she admitted to Psych?
- I'm scared. Am I gonna die?

28:52.343 --> 28:54.179
No. You're gonna be okay.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.059
Well, no wonder she's back here.

28:58.185 --> 29:00.064
Run another liter.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.610
- Who was the Attending?
- Greene.

29:03.904 --> 29:05.907
So we're picking up his slack.

29:06.325 --> 29:07.368
We are, aren't we?

29:10.833 --> 29:11.918
Right there.

29:12.085 --> 29:15.465
That's a bleed in the left anterior,
inferior cerebellar artery.

29:15.674 --> 29:18.387
Process the film.
I'll call a neurosurgeon.

29:18.595 --> 29:20.349
Mrs. Toren?

29:21.935 --> 29:23.605
Mrs. Toren?

29:23.814 --> 29:27.319
- Dr. Greene, she's decerebrating.
- I'll set up for intubation.

29:27.486 --> 29:32.244
Carter, get her husband to consent to
immediate surgery. I'll book an O.R.

29:32.452 --> 29:34.289
- She all right?
- She needs surgery.

29:34.498 --> 29:37.211
The MRl showed a leaking aneurysm
in her cerebellum.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.716
It has to be operated on.
We'll need you to sign a consent form.

29:40.925 --> 29:42.387
I'm not signing anything!

29:42.554 --> 29:45.851
You just told me she was dying.
You wanted her organs. Now she's fine!

29:46.018 --> 29:48.648
She's not fine!
She has a hemorrhage in her cerebellum.

29:48.815 --> 29:50.608
When she went in there she was fine!

29:50.775 --> 29:55.158
Carter, transport is on the way.
Be ready to intubate. I'll get Dr. Corelli.

29:55.367 --> 29:56.786
- We don't have consent.
- What?

29:56.995 --> 30:01.003
She was fine! Talking!
I don't want you opening her head!

30:01.211 --> 30:03.171
Mr. Toren, listen very carefully.

30:03.339 --> 30:06.678
Your wife will die if she doesn't have
an operation immediately.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.055
I want her moved!

30:08.223 --> 30:09.558
That will kill her.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.271
I know you care for her.
But please, let us operate.

30:12.479 --> 30:15.359
I'm serious. We are talking minutes.

30:25.753 --> 30:28.215
These are the post-op forms
Anspaugh prefers.

30:28.382 --> 30:31.012
What a dreadful old gasbag!

30:31.220 --> 30:34.517
I mean, he's a decent enough surgeon.
But all that banging on.

30:34.726 --> 30:36.771
Pathetic Anglophilia.

30:37.147 --> 30:39.860
Tell me, do you call it "pimping"?

30:40.027 --> 30:41.070
What?

30:41.238 --> 30:44.326
Treating you like a med student
with those silly questions.

30:44.535 --> 30:47.749
- We call that "pimping. "
- Yeah, that's what we call it.

30:47.958 --> 30:52.506
Fortunately, in the UK the old tossers
are too lazy to come to the O.R.s.

30:53.049 --> 30:54.093
What?

30:54.260 --> 30:56.597
We don't refer to our senior surgeons
that way.

30:56.806 --> 31:00.855
- So I should stop speaking my mind?
- No, no, no. Not on my account.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.909
I saw her on the phone to Anspaugh
and she did not look happy.

31:09.119 --> 31:12.541
Her first day and the ER blows up!

31:12.751 --> 31:15.964
I don't imagine he was saying,
"Attaboy! "

31:16.548 --> 31:19.219
- I see they got that door repaired.
- Dr. Weaver.

31:19.428 --> 31:22.099
I'm just so relieved no one was hurt.

31:22.308 --> 31:23.977
Thank you, doctor.

31:24.352 --> 31:26.773
Doug, I know it's been crazy today.

31:26.982 --> 31:29.320
But did you get a copy
of your research?

31:29.570 --> 31:32.158
I just haven't had a chance
to do it yet, Kerry.

31:32.826 --> 31:35.206
Maggie, what have you got?

31:35.414 --> 31:38.044
Abscess. Simple I and D.

31:38.794 --> 31:41.841
Looks like a fairly deep abscess.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.346
The booths in that bar are all rotten.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.767
There's nails sticking up,
maybe an inch.

31:46.975 --> 31:50.857
- Did you read my directive?
- Yeah.

31:51.441 --> 31:52.861
That really hurts.

31:53.028 --> 31:55.949
Most people don't understand
what's at stake here.

31:56.158 --> 31:59.538
The county is just looking
for an excuse to close this ER.

31:59.748 --> 32:03.337
Lab tests, x-rays, CT scans
that just cannot be justified.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.966
Next time you sit on a nail,
get here sooner.

32:06.175 --> 32:09.765
People just won't realize
that I'm trying to save this place.

32:09.973 --> 32:12.728
I need the half-inch iodoform.

32:12.895 --> 32:16.400
I'm hoping that a few people
will understand...

32:16.567 --> 32:18.404
...and come onboard.

32:20.825 --> 32:21.868
Yeah.

32:23.704 --> 32:24.749
Cut?

32:29.255 --> 32:30.592
Where's Dr. Corelli?

32:30.759 --> 32:34.014
In 3, finishing a laminectomy.
You can't go in there!

32:35.391 --> 32:38.438
Dr. Corelli?
Mark Greene, ER Attending.

32:38.605 --> 32:39.858
This is not allowed.

32:40.025 --> 32:43.948
- Dr. Corelli, I've got an emergency!
- It better be good, Dr. Greene.

32:44.156 --> 32:46.452
25-year-old woman came in comatose...

32:46.619 --> 32:50.417
...followed by periods of brief lucidity,
after which she decompensated.

32:50.626 --> 32:55.093
She's posturing, GCS-5.
MRl shows a cerebellar bleed.

32:55.259 --> 32:57.179
I took the liberty of booking O.R. 5.

32:57.346 --> 32:58.682
Helen, can you close for me?

33:04.317 --> 33:06.152
- Five pounds enough?
- All right.

33:06.319 --> 33:08.907
You'll feel a little pressure
at the top of your leg.

33:09.492 --> 33:12.831
I've found ice and Trendelenburg
excellent adjuvant therapies...

33:13.039 --> 33:15.710
...for the reduction
of these inguinal hernias.

33:16.712 --> 33:18.840
- Can we get an ice pack?
- Sure.

33:20.219 --> 33:22.472
All right, buddy,
now we're gonna fix you up...

33:22.681 --> 33:25.978
...but the first thing we gotta do
is stand you on your head.

33:26.187 --> 33:27.856
- Weird, huh?
- I like your technique.

33:28.023 --> 33:30.403
- Cranking the bed?
- No, with children.

33:30.611 --> 33:34.326
- You're so at ease with them.
- It's where I spend all my time.

33:34.535 --> 33:37.123
All your time?
That's certainly dedication.

33:37.331 --> 33:39.627
I've come to crave a bit of leisure.

33:39.836 --> 33:42.590
It's not all work and no play.
How you doing there?

33:42.799 --> 33:46.264
So when one plays, where does
one play? I mean, here in Chicago.

33:47.933 --> 33:51.021
Now, we know you can take pain...

33:51.231 --> 33:53.901
...let's see if you can
take a little cold, huh?

33:54.068 --> 33:56.906
What a guy! All right.
Why don't we just wait and see?

33:57.115 --> 34:00.579
You were about to tell me how
to unwind. Or perhaps show me?

34:00.746 --> 34:03.459
That's if you're up to playing Virgil
to my Dante.

34:05.546 --> 34:07.842
Nothing really comes to mind.

34:08.342 --> 34:10.263
I have a patient to see.

34:11.681 --> 34:14.395
Well, if you think of a place,
I'd like to invite you.

34:15.438 --> 34:18.109
I'm involved with someone.

34:18.318 --> 34:20.280
It's not a problem. Bring her along.

34:23.619 --> 34:25.121
We ever getting out of here?

34:25.330 --> 34:27.417
I think they're about through with us.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.545
- How's that wrist?
- It's okay.

34:29.713 --> 34:32.426
The doctor called it a Colles' fracture.
It's not so bad.

34:32.634 --> 34:35.849
Bill, Jeanie's here
because you've gotta be tested.

34:36.224 --> 34:38.060
Tested for what?

34:40.940 --> 34:42.650
I'm HIV-positive.

34:44.112 --> 34:46.199
You're not talking about
having AIDS, right?

34:47.201 --> 34:48.245
Yeah, I am.

34:50.916 --> 34:54.255
When we landed together,
I was bleeding pretty bad.

34:54.422 --> 34:57.092
I'm sure our blood didn't mix
when you were scratched...

34:57.260 --> 34:59.681
...but you should be tested
just to be safe.

35:01.976 --> 35:06.359
- So I could get AIDS?
- It's a very remote possibility.

35:07.694 --> 35:08.738
You got it?

35:14.205 --> 35:16.209
Oh, man!

35:16.418 --> 35:19.381
You're out there working with us
and you got AIDS?

35:19.548 --> 35:21.469
I gotta get by like everybody else.

35:21.677 --> 35:23.847
We can live with it
and take precautions.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.642
Except now maybe I got infected.

35:26.059 --> 35:28.355
Jeanie will take some blood
so we can be sure-

35:28.522 --> 35:29.940
No!

35:30.192 --> 35:31.569
Not her. I want someone else.

35:31.736 --> 35:33.530
Come on, we're talking about Jeanie-

35:33.697 --> 35:34.866
Not her!

35:37.955 --> 35:39.624
I'll get a nurse.

35:53.732 --> 35:56.445
Carol, I know what you're thinking
and you're wrong.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.906
I'm busy.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.203
- I'll follow you until-
- Why me? Why not follow her?

36:01.411 --> 36:05.294
- If it wasn't a secret, I'd tell her-
- I think this secrecy thing works for you.

36:05.503 --> 36:07.004
- I didn't flirt with her.
- No.

36:07.213 --> 36:09.634
She just likes the way
you hold an ice pack.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.973
I told her I was attached.
I didn't say who with.

36:13.140 --> 36:16.312
- I didn't say that Carol was my-
- Your what? I'm your what?

36:16.520 --> 36:17.649
Come here.

36:18.900 --> 36:22.615
I want to be with you and be here
with you because I want to.

36:22.823 --> 36:25.453
But if you don't trust me,
then this doesn't work.

36:25.745 --> 36:27.665
I have a lot of things to do.

36:28.208 --> 36:29.501
I'll be at the El.

36:29.668 --> 36:31.088
Dr. Greene?

36:33.217 --> 36:35.970
The O.R. says they clipped the base
of her aneurysm.

36:36.138 --> 36:38.350
- In time?
- She has a chance at a full recovery.

36:38.517 --> 36:40.187
Her husband wants to thank you.

36:40.354 --> 36:43.692
- This was more your case than mine.
- You made the diagnosis.

36:43.859 --> 36:46.865
When credit is offered, take it.
It doesn't happen often.

36:47.032 --> 36:48.200
Mark.

36:48.868 --> 36:50.162
Laura Quentin's back.

36:50.329 --> 36:52.124
- Who?
- The bulimia patient.

36:52.291 --> 36:56.506
I need your signature so Medicine
can admit her. Is that a problem?

36:56.714 --> 36:59.052
Because I didn't admit her before?

37:00.638 --> 37:03.559
It was a mistake.
I should've admitted her last time.

37:03.893 --> 37:06.356
She wasn't critical,
so technically it wasn't.

37:06.523 --> 37:07.818
I didn't go the extra mile.

37:08.276 --> 37:12.534
It shouldn't depend on doctors to go
the extra mile. We need a safety net.

37:12.742 --> 37:14.538
We're an ER, not a clinic.

37:14.746 --> 37:16.081
- She's doing it.
- What?

37:16.289 --> 37:18.877
Weaver's punched us out.
We're working for free.

37:19.087 --> 37:21.340
She can't do that.
I got another hour.

37:21.508 --> 37:22.760
Kerry?

37:23.511 --> 37:26.558
- This is a really bad idea.
- It's not a matter of choice.

37:26.767 --> 37:29.939
I'm not singling out nurses.
All departments have to cut back.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.858
- Who'll do nurses' duties?
- Interns.

37:32.025 --> 37:33.069
The interns?

37:33.236 --> 37:36.157
Carol, I see people
at the end of their shifts...

37:36.324 --> 37:38.285
...talking, planning social events.

37:38.453 --> 37:41.040
It can't go on.
Nurses' time isn't billed for.

37:41.207 --> 37:45.340
- They don't generate income.
- No. They just generate care.

37:45.966 --> 37:48.303
No, I just had a change of plans.

37:48.595 --> 37:51.643
Don't worry. There's a tux
rental place right by here.

37:51.851 --> 37:53.939
Listen, instead of that
rubber chicken...

37:54.106 --> 37:57.194
...why don't we go to Stella Mare
and have a nice dinner?

37:57.403 --> 37:59.322
We can be a little late.

37:59.572 --> 38:01.493
Great. Okay.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.747
- Big night?
- Yeah. Why not?

38:03.956 --> 38:06.334
- Sounds great.
- Yeah, it is.

38:06.544 --> 38:07.837
Sorry.

38:08.170 --> 38:11.343
Looking good. Looking good.

38:14.014 --> 38:17.228
There's one spot by the door
where the paint's chipped off.

38:17.812 --> 38:20.191
A few more touches
and it'll all be clean.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.323
I've been checking your employment file.
You've accrued 26 vacation days.

38:24.532 --> 38:26.202
I've never taken a day off.

38:26.369 --> 38:29.958
I'm thinking about going down
to Alabama after the first of the year.

38:30.125 --> 38:33.046
Perhaps you should start
taking that time right now.

38:33.255 --> 38:35.718
Now? It's like
a million degrees down there.

38:35.885 --> 38:39.725
I understand there's some lovely
antebellum homes down in Mobile.

38:43.899 --> 38:45.359
Did you find your student?

38:45.568 --> 38:48.866
The lab said he went
to the fish hatchery for salmon sperm.

38:49.074 --> 38:51.787
They got pretty backed up in Sutures.

38:51.954 --> 38:54.375
- Saying it's my fault?
- It's where I assigned you.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.547
- Will Dr. Del Amico be doing sutures?
- What?

38:57.922 --> 39:01.888
I'm just wondering if you'll continue
to give her the interesting cases...

39:02.096 --> 39:04.517
...while I get assigned
to suture Siberia!

39:04.684 --> 39:06.021
What are you talking about?

39:06.187 --> 39:10.068
I'm just asking if there isn't
something about Dr. Del Amico...

39:10.235 --> 39:13.158
...that you find especially appealing?

39:13.366 --> 39:14.576
Meaning?

39:15.662 --> 39:17.080
You know what I mean.

39:23.133 --> 39:24.677
That's great.

39:24.886 --> 39:26.388
That's great.

39:30.353 --> 39:32.816
- What?
- Ask him.

39:34.235 --> 39:36.447
By the way, Anna, I love your hair.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.242
Thanks.

39:39.912 --> 39:41.664
What's that about?

39:41.831 --> 39:44.169
- Nothing.
- Come on. It's the end of the day.

39:44.377 --> 39:45.671
I could use a laugh.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.257
It wasn't that funny.

39:47.466 --> 39:49.511
She has a weird sense of humor.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.140
So it's a private joke.

39:52.349 --> 39:56.648
Congratulations on that stroke lady.
I heard it was a good save.

39:56.857 --> 39:58.986
Thanks. Thanks for giving it to me.

39:59.153 --> 40:00.614
I was swamped.

40:01.448 --> 40:02.826
I'd like to return the favor.

40:03.035 --> 40:05.456
Don't, please.
I hate feeling indebted.

40:06.248 --> 40:09.503
- Wait. There is something.
- Sure.

40:09.922 --> 40:14.011
This morning you were talking
about taxes. I'm getting hammered.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.352
Yeah. You can deduct stethoscope,
lab coat, books.

40:17.518 --> 40:21.399
- Otoscope?
- Absolutely. All equipment.

40:21.775 --> 40:24.154
What about dinner?
We could talk about it.

40:24.363 --> 40:27.535
- Tonight's the Laundromat.
- Me too!

40:27.702 --> 40:30.707
Me too. We could do our laundry,
I'll do your tax plan-

40:30.916 --> 40:32.711
- Laundry's deductible.
- Really?

40:33.587 --> 40:36.509
Okay. I'll get us some sandwiches.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.011
Great.

41:03.763 --> 41:04.974
Doug!

41:07.437 --> 41:10.776
I had prepared a very elaborate
argument. This mean I don't need it?

41:10.943 --> 41:12.904
I already had the argument,
with myself.

41:13.112 --> 41:16.995
- I hope there wasn't any name-calling.
- No, it was very civil. You won.

41:17.204 --> 41:20.793
- So I do better when I'm not there.
- This time, yeah.

41:22.588 --> 41:24.174
So you trust me?

41:24.716 --> 41:26.302
This time.

41:29.308 --> 41:31.102
Are you keeping score?

41:31.268 --> 41:34.566
- Yeah. You're ahead.
- I'm sorry. What?

41:34.817 --> 41:38.323
"Talk on rotator cuff injuries
in track and field. "

41:38.532 --> 41:40.660
What exactly does that mean?

41:41.663 --> 41:43.915
You're the doctor.
You should know that.

41:44.125 --> 41:46.879
I probably did know that
before we drank this.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.220
I have an idea.
Why don't we drink another bottle?

41:51.387 --> 41:53.849
Then we can obliterate
all medical knowledge.

41:54.017 --> 41:55.561
Sounds good.

42:02.823 --> 42:04.243
What?

42:05.536 --> 42:06.831
I missed you.

42:07.289 --> 42:10.211
No, come on. You never called.
You vanished.

42:10.712 --> 42:13.508
I was a fool, okay?
I'll make it up to you.

42:13.717 --> 42:15.052
Promise?

42:27.740 --> 42:30.787
It won't work with dimes and nickels.
You gotta use quarters.

42:30.954 --> 42:32.749
You don't have any quarters, do you?

42:38.426 --> 42:39.886
Cool.

42:50.029 --> 42:51.740
You should let your wife do this.

42:51.907 --> 42:55.288
My wife? Oh, yeah.
She's getting some sandwiches for us.

42:55.454 --> 42:58.460
You don't know what you're doing.

42:58.669 --> 43:01.632
What are you doing?
Sorry. What's going on?

43:01.841 --> 43:04.637
I don't know!
This thing just, like, broke on me.

43:07.767 --> 43:09.396
It can't take this kind of load.

43:09.605 --> 43:11.734
Haven't you ever used a dryer before?

43:11.942 --> 43:15.782
Yeah, but the one in my neighborhood
handles loads like this.

43:15.991 --> 43:17.994
Even bigger ones, all the time.

43:19.246 --> 43:20.875
Okay.

43:23.170 --> 43:25.841
All right, we gotta get this-

43:26.216 --> 43:27.719
Let me see-

43:31.976 --> 43:33.020
Wow!

43:33.187 --> 43:34.898
How about a hoagie?

43:35.482 --> 43:36.526
Here.

43:40.992 --> 43:42.201
Oh, no!

43:47.753 --> 43:51.885
Wow. It's gonna be a long night
in the Laundromat.

44:05.993 --> 44:07.830
What's wrong?

44:08.456 --> 44:10.542
Nothing. I'm just-

44:16.344 --> 44:17.764
I don't know.

44:21.603 --> 44:23.398
I used to turn you on.

44:24.858 --> 44:28.531
No, you turn me on. I just...

44:33.123 --> 44:36.921
I guess I've just been
a little stressed out.

44:38.381 --> 44:41.720
I'd rather you didn't smoke in here.
I'm allergic.

44:48.107 --> 44:49.902
Maybe it'd be better if I...

44:50.819 --> 44:52.657
...you know, kind of got going.

44:56.454 --> 44:57.957
I didn't say that.

45:08.266 --> 45:10.229
Maybe it is better if you go.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
