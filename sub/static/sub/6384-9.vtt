I got to tell you
all the bad shit I did.

00:04.503 --> 00:06.637
so, uh, what?
You hocked everything.

00:06.672 --> 00:07.705
Is that it?

00:07.740 --> 00:09.674
The cartier love bracelet,

Hey, I didn't sell
that ceramic bowl

00:14.480 --> 00:16.114
that they gave us
as a wedding present.

00:16.148 --> 00:17.348
Oh, well.

00:17.382 --> 00:18.783
I-I made that for you.

00:18.817 --> 00:21.753
I know. It's special
as shit to me.

00:22.955 --> 00:25.890
That's for you, by the way.
I made it in art therapy.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.626
You're welcome.
Thank you.

It's part of the process.

00:44.143 --> 00:46.444
There was just
a little bit of tongue.

I was gonna get on the plane
to see my mother -- I swear.

00:49.948 --> 00:54.285
But the guy had some blow.
One thing lead to another...

00:54.319 --> 00:55.319
We made out a little.

anything like that,

you wouldn't want to hear
about it, would you?

You absolutely would not want
to know something like that.

Of course I was alive.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.869
[ chuckles ]
it was a good time.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.671
I was in the mail room
at william morris.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.106
Marce was still
at n.y.u.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.709
One day, somebody broke in
to her dorm room.

19:04.743 --> 19:08.212
Some homeless crack addict snuck
in and stole all her jewelry,

19:08.247 --> 19:11.349
so I tried to think of a movie
that might cheer her up.

19:11.383 --> 19:12.617
It worked, didn't it?

19:12.651 --> 19:15.319
We had to go all the way up
to 57th street to see it --

19:15.354 --> 19:17.922
Some crappy little theater
that's not even there anymore.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.724
The duane reade
across the street --

19:19.758 --> 19:22.193
Where I went in to buy her
twizzlers and a diet coke --

19:22.261 --> 19:23.261
That's still there.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.432
Charlie,
she'll get better.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.566
She'll be home soon

19:28.600 --> 19:30.968
and everything
will get back to normal.

19:31.003 --> 19:31.936
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.372
She'll quit the bolivian
marching powder.

19:34.406 --> 19:36.140
I'll put my libido
back in a box

19:36.175 --> 19:37.375
and re-don the suit.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.744
Then the whole cycle
can start over again.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.479
Well, I don't know much
about marriage,

19:41.547 --> 19:44.482

so entirely bad to me.

You're probably right.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.322

right?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.058
I mean, you choose your partner,
then you do the dance.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.527
What's the alternative?
Sit the whole thing out?

19:56.595 --> 19:58.930
No way.
You can't do that,
right?

19:58.964 --> 19:59.931

anything carnal --

20:12.311 --> 20:14.278
Just a simple box step.

Maybe that can work.

for that, right?

So it was a date?

Well, anytime two people
meet after 7:00 p.m.,

21:44.870 --> 21:45.970
it's a date, right?

What the fuck
is wrong with people?

to let go of your hand.
I know.
