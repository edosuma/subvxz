WEBVTT

00:03.097 --> 00:06.968
I don't understand.
You've got all the evidence.

00:07.001 --> 00:09.637
He knows he killed her.
What defense could he have?

00:09.670 --> 00:11.305
Honestly, I don't know.

00:11.339 --> 00:12.606
I thought insanity,

00:12.640 --> 00:16.110
but I guess they can't find
a shrink willing to testify.

00:16.143 --> 00:17.411
(sighs)

00:17.445 --> 00:21.249
I prayed he'd plead guilty
so this would be over.

00:25.653 --> 00:27.188
Well, we don't start
for another hour.

00:27.221 --> 00:30.724
We can still offer him a deal.

00:32.994 --> 00:34.628
JOHNSON: What kind of deal?

00:34.662 --> 00:38.632
Murder two,
and that's a gift.

00:38.666 --> 00:39.800
That's still life, man.

00:39.834 --> 00:42.203
With the possibility
of parole.

00:42.236 --> 00:43.137
No. No.

00:43.171 --> 00:45.706
Daryl, you have no defense.

00:45.739 --> 00:47.475
Your semen was found
in the victim.

00:47.508 --> 00:48.709
I made love with her earlier.

00:48.742 --> 00:50.611
Your prints
are on the murder weapon.

00:50.644 --> 00:52.546
A witness saw you
run out of her apartment

00:52.580 --> 00:54.015
at the time she was murdered.

00:54.048 --> 00:56.784
The witness got it wrong,
Mr. Young.

00:56.817 --> 00:57.785
It's as simple as that.

00:57.818 --> 00:59.153
Well, she seems pretty sure.

00:59.187 --> 01:02.823
She got it wrong.

01:02.857 --> 01:05.894
A friend of mine in this trial
called this doctor witness.

01:05.927 --> 01:07.428
He talked about
how some white people

01:07.461 --> 01:08.696
can't tell
black people apart--

01:08.729 --> 01:10.531
some disease
or something like that.

01:10.564 --> 01:13.501
That witness has got that
disease is all.

01:13.534 --> 01:16.004
We gotta call this doctor.

01:16.037 --> 01:18.840
I don't think race
is an issue here, Daryl.

01:18.873 --> 01:21.075
You don't understand,
Mr. Young.

01:21.109 --> 01:23.377
I'm instructing you
to make it an issue.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.750
(music playing)

02:16.130 --> 02:18.032
What do you mean
you want out?

02:18.066 --> 02:19.433
Just what I'm saying,
Your Honor.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.402
The trial is set to start
in 40 minutes.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.504
My client and I have
insurmountable differences

02:23.537 --> 02:25.773
which would have.
Such as?

02:25.806 --> 02:28.109
That's privileged.

02:28.142 --> 02:31.312
Let's just say it's about
strategy and ethics.

02:31.345 --> 02:35.016
Eugene, every lawyer seems to
have insurmountable differences

02:35.049 --> 02:37.051
with the court-appointed cases.

02:37.085 --> 02:39.287
I'm telling you
this one is real.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.789
You know me well enough to know
that if I say it,

02:41.822 --> 02:42.857
it is real.

02:42.891 --> 02:46.160
I'm not letting you out
for a strategy difference.

02:46.194 --> 02:47.395
Forget it.

02:47.428 --> 02:51.365
Your Honor,
I'm asking a favor here.

02:51.399 --> 02:53.902
I can't let you out.

02:53.935 --> 02:55.403
Not now.

03:01.109 --> 03:02.443
WASHINGTON:
When did they take him in?

03:02.476 --> 03:03.577
Three weeks ago.

03:03.611 --> 03:05.713
And they wouldn't tell you
anything?

03:05.746 --> 03:08.716
The only thing I know is that
the FBI has him somewhere.

03:09.817 --> 03:12.253
I hired a lawyer.
He got nowhere.

03:12.286 --> 03:14.622
I hate coming to a patient,
but I--

03:14.655 --> 03:17.591
No problem.
Your husband's first name?

03:17.625 --> 03:18.559
FORD: Bill.

03:18.592 --> 03:20.929
Bill Ford.
And his middle initial?

03:20.962 --> 03:22.663
Habib.

03:22.696 --> 03:23.865
I'm sorry?

03:23.898 --> 03:24.899
Ford is my maiden name.

03:24.933 --> 03:28.602
My husband's last name
is Habib.

03:31.572 --> 03:35.209
All I'm saying, I just think
if the FBI picked him up,

03:35.243 --> 03:37.045
they must have had
a good reason.

03:37.078 --> 03:39.180
This woman is my doctor,
Jimmy.

03:39.213 --> 03:42.616
Her husband's been in this
country for 30 years.

03:42.650 --> 03:45.553
Why'd they grab him?
Just because he's Arab?

03:45.586 --> 03:48.656
He's Arab-American, and we don't
know why they grabbed him.

03:48.689 --> 03:50.124
They're not telling us.

03:50.158 --> 03:52.160
Like I said,
the last time I checked,

03:52.193 --> 03:55.396
The police don't arrest people
for no reason.

03:55.429 --> 03:58.632
When is the last time
you checked?

04:04.705 --> 04:07.175
Linda McLaughlin was the first
person in her family

04:07.208 --> 04:09.677
to go to college.

04:09.710 --> 04:12.046
These are her parents.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.884
The evidence will show that
on November 19th of last year,

04:15.917 --> 04:19.653
their daughter, Linda, walked
out of the campus grocery store

04:19.687 --> 04:22.957
and was accosted by the
defendant,

04:22.991 --> 04:24.926
Daryl Johnson,

04:24.959 --> 04:28.930
A homeless man
who panhandles in the area.

04:28.963 --> 04:31.933
Daryl followed Linda home...

04:31.966 --> 04:34.468
raped her...

04:34.502 --> 04:37.205
then beat her to death.

04:37.238 --> 04:39.073
After we prove it,

04:39.107 --> 04:41.876
I will ask you to find
Daryl Johnson guilty

04:41.910 --> 04:44.245
of murder
in the first degree.

04:48.883 --> 04:50.418
Mr. Young?

04:55.356 --> 04:57.825
(clears throat)
Mr. Young?

05:02.563 --> 05:03.965
The evidence
will not establish

05:03.998 --> 05:07.035
that Daryl Johnson committed
this crime.

05:07.068 --> 05:10.204
the evidence will establish that
the police arrested him

05:10.238 --> 05:13.541
simply because he fit
the profile in their minds

05:13.574 --> 05:17.145
of the type of person who would
commit this particular crime.

05:27.788 --> 05:31.425
(phone ringing)

05:31.459 --> 05:32.660
RENFORD: I'm special agent
Charles Renford.

05:32.693 --> 05:34.428
Sorry for the delay.
WASHINGTON: Oh, no problem.

05:34.462 --> 05:35.663
I assume you guys are pretty
busy right now.

05:35.696 --> 05:37.031
RENFORD:
What can I do for you?

05:37.065 --> 05:40.501
I've been trying to talk to
these agents about Bill Habib.

05:40.534 --> 05:42.703
RENFORD: These agents got
pulled onto details overseas.

05:42.736 --> 05:45.273
They are not available.

05:45.306 --> 05:46.474
Okay.

05:46.507 --> 05:49.543
Can you tell me anything?

05:49.577 --> 05:51.112
I'm sorry. I can't.

05:52.713 --> 05:56.484
Is that because you don't know
or because you won't say?

05:59.253 --> 06:00.521
Agent Renford,

06:00.554 --> 06:03.992
I am formally requesting you
let me see my client.

06:04.025 --> 06:06.794
I'm afraid you can't.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.863
What do you mean?
I'm his lawyer.

06:08.897 --> 06:10.498
You can't see him,
Miss Washington.

06:10.531 --> 06:12.700
That's all I can say.

06:12.733 --> 06:13.935
Are you familiar
with the concept

06:13.968 --> 06:15.603
of due process,
Agent Renford?

06:20.774 --> 06:21.910
DONNELL: First, find out
where he's being held.

06:21.943 --> 06:23.912
Call the Bureau of Prisons.
WASHINGTON: I did,

06:23.945 --> 06:25.379
along with the
Board of Corrections,

06:25.413 --> 06:26.881
Suffolk County Jail,
middle-sex.

06:26.915 --> 06:28.082
Nobody knows a thing.

06:28.116 --> 06:29.283
Call the I. N. S.

06:29.317 --> 06:30.784
They can hold someone
indefinitely

06:30.818 --> 06:33.321
even if there's a hint
of an immigration problem.

06:33.354 --> 06:35.756
He's a U. S. citizen.
He has been for 20 years.

06:35.789 --> 06:38.626
I'd still check it out. You
don't know what they can do now.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.028
What about his first lawyer?

06:40.061 --> 06:42.463
He won't talk to me,
says he's been ordered not to.

06:42.496 --> 06:43.998
DONNELL: Ordered?
By who?

06:44.032 --> 06:46.400
I have no idea.

06:46.434 --> 06:48.937
Okay.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.840
If the Feds took him, you gotta
assume they still got him.

06:51.873 --> 06:53.074
File a Federal Habeas.

06:53.107 --> 06:55.209
Make them produce his body,
at least.

06:58.646 --> 07:00.681
The girl had just
walked out of the market

07:00.714 --> 07:01.883
when he walked up to her.

07:01.916 --> 07:02.984
This girl?

07:03.017 --> 07:04.418
Yes.

07:04.452 --> 07:07.321
Mr. Banks, had you ever
seen the defendant before?

07:07.355 --> 07:10.859
He's a street guy,
carries your bags for change.

07:10.892 --> 07:12.126
Sometimes
he can get aggressive.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.327
Objection.

07:13.361 --> 07:15.997
Sustained.
The Jury will disregard.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.933
GAMBLE: Just tell us
what you saw that day.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.235
He tried to carry
her shopping bags,

07:21.269 --> 07:24.205
and she was like,
"Whoa, I got it."

07:24.238 --> 07:26.040
They kind of argued
over the bags for a minute,

07:26.074 --> 07:28.342
and then she walked away.

07:28.376 --> 07:30.144
GAMBLE: What did
the defendant do then?

07:30.178 --> 07:32.546
He stood there pissed.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.916
Then he started to follow her.

07:34.949 --> 07:37.118
YOUNG: Did you hear
anything they said?

07:37.151 --> 07:38.252
No.

07:38.286 --> 07:39.753
Then when you say they argued--

07:39.787 --> 07:41.222
It looked like they argued.

07:41.255 --> 07:42.556
About the bags.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.625
Could they have been talking
about something else?

07:44.658 --> 07:46.260
I don't know.
I guess.

07:46.294 --> 07:47.695
YOUNG: You guess?

07:47.728 --> 07:50.464
So it's possible then they were
talking about something else?

07:50.498 --> 07:51.966
Yes.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.701
YOUNG: And Mr. Banks,
you never thought Ms. McLaughlin

07:53.734 --> 07:55.469
was in danger,
did you, sir?

07:55.503 --> 07:56.905
In danger?

07:56.938 --> 07:58.806
Yes.
You saw her with my client.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.141
You didn't think
she needed help

08:00.174 --> 08:02.610
or that you should call
the police, did you?

08:02.643 --> 08:03.912
No.

08:03.945 --> 08:05.313
Thank you, sir.

08:13.154 --> 08:14.488
That's it?

08:16.690 --> 08:19.193
Daryl, if you're unhappy
with my work,

08:19.227 --> 08:22.030
you can tell the judge
and get a new lawyer.

08:23.965 --> 08:26.935
You're the right lawyer
for this, Mr. Young.

08:26.968 --> 08:28.402
I'm sure about that.

08:38.479 --> 08:39.746
WASHINGTON: Agent Renford,
I didn't expect to see--

08:39.780 --> 08:41.381
MCNALLY: Theodore McNally,
Assistant U. S. Attorney.

08:41.414 --> 08:44.284
Thanks for coming down.
Let me give you this back.

08:45.486 --> 08:47.255
It's my Habeas.

08:47.288 --> 08:48.389
It isn't filed?

08:48.422 --> 08:51.025
Clerk's office caught it.
You can't file it.

08:52.826 --> 08:54.428
What do you mean
I can't file it?

08:54.462 --> 08:56.797
This involves
classified material,

08:56.831 --> 08:58.166
top-secret or higher.
It can't be--

08:58.199 --> 09:01.202
I'm just asking
to see my client.

09:01.235 --> 09:03.671
Now, when do I get
to see my client?

09:03.704 --> 09:06.740
(sighs)

09:06.774 --> 09:09.010
After you get a national
security clearance.

09:09.043 --> 09:10.411
Renford will expedite it.

09:10.444 --> 09:13.114
I'll need your home address,
Social-Security number,

09:13.147 --> 09:16.417
names of family members,
and how you know Mr. Habib.

09:16.450 --> 09:18.286
I haven't even met him yet!

09:18.319 --> 09:19.187
Hold on.

09:21.755 --> 09:23.491
I need to warn you,
anything you say

09:23.524 --> 09:25.994
can and will be used
against you and your client.

09:26.027 --> 09:27.795
Use against me--
What are you talk--

09:27.828 --> 09:30.298
This case involves
national security.

09:30.331 --> 09:33.134
You want to defend Habib,
you need a clearance.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.468
To get it,
you gotta go through us,

09:34.502 --> 09:35.503
answer our questions.

09:35.536 --> 09:37.305
If you lie to us,
it's perjury.

09:37.338 --> 09:40.574
Plus, everything we tell you
is privileged.

09:40.608 --> 09:42.776
If you divulge
any of it to anyone,

09:42.810 --> 09:44.545
you'll be prosecuted.

09:44.578 --> 09:48.049
And what if I don't want
a security clearance?

09:48.082 --> 09:51.085
What if I object it's
a violation of my rights?

09:52.320 --> 09:54.755
Then Mr. Habib
gets no lawyer.

10:04.032 --> 10:05.366
WASHINGTON: I'd need
security clearance

10:05.399 --> 10:07.401
to see my own client,
who I never met.

10:07.435 --> 10:08.669
I don't know
why he was arrested.

10:08.702 --> 10:10.804
Rebecca, these are
different times.

10:10.839 --> 10:12.673
Thank you, Lucy.

10:12.706 --> 10:13.842
So, what happens next?

10:13.875 --> 10:15.743
Assuming I get the clearance,

10:15.776 --> 10:18.279
I'm hoping to meet
the client tomorrow.

10:22.516 --> 10:23.684
I haven't found him yet.

10:26.754 --> 10:28.389
So we're off to Federal Court.

10:28.422 --> 10:30.591
I'm hoping to persuade a Judge
to order the government

10:30.624 --> 10:32.360
to at least tell us
where he is.

10:32.393 --> 10:36.330
(sighs) Okay.

10:36.364 --> 10:38.699
Sarah, is it possible

10:38.732 --> 10:41.635
your husband is involved
in something?

10:44.238 --> 10:46.074
No, Rebecca,
that's not possible.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.544
I'm sorry.

10:50.578 --> 10:53.714
As your lawyer,
I had to ask you that question.

10:53.747 --> 10:54.849
Right.

10:54.883 --> 10:57.751
We wouldn't want you
committing malpractice.

11:03.958 --> 11:07.461
Numerous skull fractures,
massive and fatal head trauma.

11:07.495 --> 11:09.130
What caused these injuries,
detective?

11:09.163 --> 11:12.133
A table lamp was found near
the body covered with blood

11:12.166 --> 11:13.601
and portions of her scalp.

11:13.634 --> 11:15.837
It was determined
to be the murder weapon.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.872
Were any fingerprints
on the lamp?

11:17.906 --> 11:19.473
The defendant's fingerprints
were found

11:19.507 --> 11:22.610
on both the lamp
and the victim.

11:22.643 --> 11:25.179
Detective...

11:25.213 --> 11:27.181
what other evidence
did you find?

11:27.215 --> 11:30.384
A rape examination revealed
the presence of semen.

11:30.418 --> 11:34.188
We did a DNA test.
It matched the defendant.

11:34.222 --> 11:35.957
Thank you.

11:39.227 --> 11:42.063
KITTLESON: Mr. Young?

11:42.096 --> 11:43.865
YOUNG: Did you find bruising?

11:43.898 --> 11:46.067
DETECTIVE: We found bludgeoning.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.569
That wasn't my question.

11:48.602 --> 11:51.772
Did you find bruising
in the vaginal area?

11:51.805 --> 11:52.673
We didn't find that.

11:52.706 --> 11:54.075
YOUNG: How about tearing?

11:54.108 --> 11:55.543
DETECTIVE: No.

11:55.576 --> 11:57.946
Did you find defensive wounds
on the victim's hands or arms,

11:57.979 --> 12:00.081
skin under her fingernails?

12:00.114 --> 12:01.515
No.

12:01.549 --> 12:04.752
Detective, can you rule out the
possibility of consensual sex?

12:04.785 --> 12:06.554
Objection.
Overruled.

12:06.587 --> 12:08.589
Doesn't sound like
she was fighting, does it?

12:08.622 --> 12:10.124
This could have
been consensual.

12:10.158 --> 12:12.026
Sidebar, Your Honor.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.361
Quickly.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.635
There is no good-faith basis

12:21.669 --> 12:23.972
for the suggestion
of consensual sex here,

12:24.005 --> 12:25.139
and he knows it.

12:25.173 --> 12:26.841
My client says
it's consensual.

12:26.875 --> 12:27.741
That's it?

12:27.775 --> 12:29.677
That's all he needs.

12:29.710 --> 12:31.880
It's bad enough the parents have
to sit here and listen--

12:31.913 --> 12:35.449
You can advise the parents to
leave the room. Why don't you?

12:35.483 --> 12:39.353
This is your defense?
That the sex was consensual?

12:39.387 --> 12:40.721
This is his defense,
Your Honor,

12:40.754 --> 12:43.591
and you can take me off
whenever you please.

12:43.624 --> 12:45.826
(sighs)

12:45.860 --> 12:49.130
Assuming that Mr. Young does, in
fact, have a good-faith basis

12:49.163 --> 12:50.731
for the question,
I'll allow it.

12:50.764 --> 12:51.933
Your Honor--

12:51.966 --> 12:55.003
he's entitled to put
on a defense, counsel.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.739
But tread lightly, Eugene.

12:58.772 --> 13:00.508
Now step back.

13:04.445 --> 13:06.514
YOUNG: Detective...

13:06.547 --> 13:09.583
is it possible the sex here
was consensual, yes or no?

13:09.617 --> 13:10.919
I suppose it's possible,
but--

13:10.952 --> 13:13.121
Thank you, sir.

13:13.154 --> 13:14.422
That's all.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.069
MAN: Sorry, ma'am,
no bags inside.

13:28.102 --> 13:29.703
Can I get a piece of paper
and a pen?

13:29.737 --> 13:32.140
MAN: No, ma'am.
No writing materials.

13:32.173 --> 13:34.208
(sighs)

13:34.242 --> 13:35.443
Sorry, ma'am.

13:36.744 --> 13:37.811
What's wrong?

13:37.846 --> 13:39.747
Closed courtroom.
Only the lawyers.

13:39.780 --> 13:40.882
This is the man's wife.

13:40.915 --> 13:42.750
Orders of the court, ma'am.
No visitors.

13:42.783 --> 13:44.652
Please, he's my husband.
I haven't seen him in weeks.

13:44.685 --> 13:46.454
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

13:46.487 --> 13:48.389
You're just
following orders, right?

13:53.161 --> 13:54.963
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:54.996 --> 13:56.764
I understand.

13:56.797 --> 13:58.032
Go ahead, Rebecca.

13:58.066 --> 14:00.068
Just please tell Bill
I'm out here.

14:02.003 --> 14:03.671
(sighs)

14:06.474 --> 14:09.443
I heard the screaming, and I
knew something wasn't right,

14:09.477 --> 14:12.847
so I opened my apartment door
and looked out,

14:12.881 --> 14:14.883
and there he was.

14:14.916 --> 14:16.350
This man right here?

14:16.384 --> 14:20.054
SOLOTKIN: Yes. He was dressed
ratty, like a bum,

14:20.088 --> 14:22.456
and he didn't smell
too good either.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.824
GAMBLE: Did he say anything?

14:23.858 --> 14:26.460
SOLOTKIN: No, but as soon
as he saw I was looking at him,

14:26.494 --> 14:28.796
he ran for the stairs.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.498
GAMBLE: You're absolutely sure

14:30.531 --> 14:33.835
this is the man you saw leave
Ms. McLaughlin's apartment?

14:33.868 --> 14:34.836
Positive.

14:34.869 --> 14:36.570
GAMBLE:
Right after you heard screaming?

14:36.604 --> 14:39.540
SOLOTKIN: That's right.

14:39.573 --> 14:42.110
YOUNG: Did you know the victim,
Mrs. Solotkin?

14:42.143 --> 14:44.645
Not personally,
but I'd seen her.

14:44.678 --> 14:46.014
Ever talk to her?

14:46.047 --> 14:47.215
Not really.

14:47.248 --> 14:50.018
So you don't know her voice.

14:50.051 --> 14:50.919
No.

14:50.952 --> 14:52.620
Wouldn't recognize
her scream?

14:52.653 --> 14:55.023
No, but I'm assuming
it must have been her.

14:55.056 --> 14:57.425
The scream came at the time
she was killed.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.827
YOUNG: You're assuming.

14:59.861 --> 15:01.495
Do you know many
black people?

15:01.529 --> 15:02.363
Objection.

15:02.396 --> 15:03.531
Have any black friends?

15:03.564 --> 15:05.799
KITTLESON: Mr. Young,
what are you doing?

15:05.834 --> 15:07.035
Laying a foundation,
Your Honor.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.702
A foundation for what?

15:08.736 --> 15:11.505
If I could be allowed
to proceed, I'll get there.

15:12.506 --> 15:14.408
Do you recall the question?

15:14.442 --> 15:16.210
About black people?

15:16.244 --> 15:18.046
I don't really know
any that well.

15:18.079 --> 15:20.814
But you know for sure
it was my client

15:20.849 --> 15:22.984
even though you saw him
for just a moment

15:23.017 --> 15:23.852
from down the hall?

15:24.853 --> 15:25.920
Well, I don't know for sure.

15:25.954 --> 15:27.055
It could have been
somebody else

15:27.088 --> 15:29.590
who looked exactly like him,
I suppose.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.862
Thank you, ma'am.

15:33.895 --> 15:35.263
Nothing further.

15:35.864 --> 15:37.731
KITTLESON:
The witness may step down.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.069
Ms. Gamble?

15:41.102 --> 15:42.803
The Commonwealth rests.

15:43.704 --> 15:46.407
Mr. Young?

15:46.440 --> 15:48.910
The defense calls
Dr. Donald Sideman.

15:48.943 --> 15:50.644
You gotta be kidding!

15:50.678 --> 15:52.847
If I can't put on a defense,
why don't we lynch him?

15:52.881 --> 15:55.049
Mr. Young is trying
to make this about race--

15:55.083 --> 15:56.017
Move to strike!

15:56.050 --> 15:58.519
Counsel, get up here.

16:03.324 --> 16:05.059
I will hold both of you
in contempt

16:05.093 --> 16:09.030
if there's another
such outburst.

16:09.063 --> 16:10.331
Who is Dr. Sideman?

16:10.364 --> 16:13.835
He testifies white people can't
tell one black man from another.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.769
Sorry?

16:15.803 --> 16:18.806
He's an expert on cross-racial
impairment of eyewitnesses.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.408
This has been rejected
by other courts.

16:20.441 --> 16:22.410
Plus, Mr. Young
gave no notice.

16:22.443 --> 16:24.078
YOUNG: I didn't know race
would be an issue.

16:24.112 --> 16:25.947
You are the one
making race an issue.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.616
If I can't call this witness,
I'll take you up,

16:28.649 --> 16:31.085
emergency appeal,
and I want a mistrial.

16:33.054 --> 16:34.588
You may call Dr. Sideman.

16:34.622 --> 16:35.924
You're letting him
run your court.

16:35.957 --> 16:39.193
I run my court, Ms. Gamble.

16:41.562 --> 16:43.597
If Dr. Sideman is a buffoon,

16:43.631 --> 16:45.867
I will instruct the jury
to disregard.

16:50.038 --> 16:51.973
REBECCA: He's been kept
from his family for three weeks,

16:52.006 --> 16:53.942
and we don't know
what he's been charged with.

16:53.975 --> 16:55.543
He hasn't been charged
with anything.

16:55.576 --> 16:57.545
Then how and why
are you holding him?

16:57.578 --> 16:59.513
MCNALLY: He's being held
as a material witness.

16:59.547 --> 17:00.648
WASHINGTON: To what?

17:00.681 --> 17:02.050
That information
I can't reveal.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.751
WASHINGTON:
How do I represent him

17:03.784 --> 17:05.987
if I can't be told
why he's being held?

17:06.020 --> 17:07.755
This case involves
information obtained

17:07.788 --> 17:09.790
through the foreign-intelligence
surveillance act.

17:09.823 --> 17:13.361
Mr. McNally, I appreciate your
concern for national security,

17:13.394 --> 17:15.396
but I'm going to do my part

17:15.429 --> 17:18.031
to safeguard what is left
of our constitution.

17:18.066 --> 17:20.701
Get Mr. Habib
into this courtroom.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.070
Let him see his lawyer
and his wife,

17:23.104 --> 17:24.271
and we are going to make sure

17:24.305 --> 17:26.339
that he gets at least
some kind of hearing.

17:26.374 --> 17:28.541
Your honor, I don't think
you have the authority--

17:28.576 --> 17:31.012
Counsel!

17:31.045 --> 17:32.813
These are strange times,

17:32.847 --> 17:35.449
And nobody is quite sure
who has what authority,

17:35.483 --> 17:36.550
I grant you,

17:36.584 --> 17:39.453
but you don't want
to be testing mine.

17:39.487 --> 17:42.023
If I don't see Mr. Habib
in this room

17:42.056 --> 17:43.992
with his lawyer and his wife,

17:44.025 --> 17:46.760
you are going to be held
in contempt.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.735
Many eyewitnesses
have a hard time

17:54.768 --> 17:56.871
correctly identifying
suspects

17:56.905 --> 17:59.107
who are of another race.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.276
We call that
"cross-racial impairment."

18:02.911 --> 18:04.045
YOUNG: Is it common?

18:04.078 --> 18:04.745
SIDEMAN: Very.

18:04.778 --> 18:06.180
How do you know?

18:06.214 --> 18:08.917
From my work
as a Clinical Psychologist,

18:08.950 --> 18:12.286
from my review of over 50 years
of empirical studies

18:12.320 --> 18:13.721
on the subject.

18:13.754 --> 18:15.823
YOUNG: Are certain people
more likely to suffer

18:15.857 --> 18:17.591
from this impairment?

18:17.625 --> 18:21.830
People unfamiliar with members
of the race in question.

18:21.863 --> 18:24.132
They don't see black people
very often.

18:24.165 --> 18:26.767
Suddenly,
they have to identify one.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.071
They're more likely
to pick the wrong one.

18:30.104 --> 18:31.739
Thank you, Doctor.

18:39.547 --> 18:43.384
Blacks all look alike--is that
your scientific opinion?

18:43.417 --> 18:44.185
YOUNG: Objection.

18:44.218 --> 18:45.119
KITTLESON: Sustained.

18:45.819 --> 18:48.556
Doctor, did you talk
to Mrs. Solotkin

18:48.589 --> 18:51.092
about her identification
of the defendant?

18:51.125 --> 18:52.360
No.

18:52.393 --> 18:54.695
Are you aware
that there's no agreement

18:54.728 --> 18:56.130
in the scientific community

18:56.164 --> 18:59.167
that cross-racial
impairment even exists?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.470
Cross-racial impairment
is real.

19:02.503 --> 19:06.074
SIDEMAN: When studies confirm
what life has already taught us,

19:06.107 --> 19:08.977
to me, that's the best proof
you can get.

19:09.010 --> 19:11.045
GAMBLE: Well, is that why many
courts have refused

19:11.079 --> 19:12.213
to let you testify?

19:13.147 --> 19:16.450
Science often outpaces the law,
Ms. Gamble.

19:23.191 --> 19:24.959
He's trying to hang the jury.

19:24.993 --> 19:26.827
Should I call my own experts?

19:26.861 --> 19:28.897
I'm afraid the more
I attack his defense,

19:28.930 --> 19:30.731
the more credible
I make it seem.

19:30.764 --> 19:32.633
If you do nothing, it looks
like you're conceding.

19:34.502 --> 19:37.571
He's made it about race
because he's got nothing else.

19:37.605 --> 19:39.740
What he does have
are four black jurors.

19:39.773 --> 19:40.842
Oh, please.

19:40.875 --> 19:41.709
And he's black.

19:44.112 --> 19:47.581
Race isn't the issue,
but it probably won't be.

19:48.782 --> 19:49.884
(sighs)

19:49.918 --> 19:52.620
But we can't be so naive
as to rule out the possibility.

19:52.653 --> 19:55.589
(knocks on door)

19:55.623 --> 19:56.958
Got a second?

20:09.871 --> 20:11.505
Don't look at me
like I'm having fun.

20:11.539 --> 20:14.075
Have you looked at
the crime scene photos, Eugene?

20:14.108 --> 20:16.878
I've seen them. Look, you know
It's an appointment, so--

20:16.911 --> 20:20.849
Oh, come on, spare me
the "Just doing my job" crap.

20:20.882 --> 20:23.184
Good lawyers manage
without going racial.

20:23.217 --> 20:25.819
My client instructed me
to put on a defense.

20:25.854 --> 20:27.021
That defense?

20:27.055 --> 20:28.356
As a matter of fact, yes.

20:28.389 --> 20:30.558
If you're here to wiggle off
the moral hook...

20:30.591 --> 20:32.260
That's not why I'm here.

20:34.963 --> 20:36.297
He's going to testify.

20:38.332 --> 20:40.234
You'll be suborning perjury.

20:40.268 --> 20:42.536
Only if I know he's lying,
which I don't.

20:42.570 --> 20:45.874
He says he's innocent,
Helen.

20:45.907 --> 20:48.642
I think we should plead this,
or in the alternative,

20:48.676 --> 20:50.278
you should tell the parents
not to be there.

20:50.311 --> 20:51.579
It won't be easy to hear.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.215
That a threat?

20:54.248 --> 20:58.019
It would be unethical for me
to make a threat.

20:58.052 --> 20:59.387
Wouldn't it, Helen?

21:00.221 --> 21:03.091
I won't be blackmailed
into a plea deal.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.595
You done?

21:10.331 --> 21:11.933
Done.

21:13.234 --> 21:14.735
(door opens)

21:23.544 --> 21:25.179
GAMBLE: For your own
emotional welfare,

21:25.213 --> 21:27.315
I'd say stay out
of the room, but...

21:27.348 --> 21:28.149
But what?

21:28.182 --> 21:30.651
(sighs) Well, strictly
for the case,

21:30.684 --> 21:32.720
obviously, it's better
if you're in there.

21:32.753 --> 21:34.155
He'll look
more like a monster

21:34.188 --> 21:37.358
saying the things he'll probably
say with the parents present.

21:37.391 --> 21:38.259
He's going to attack
my daughter?

21:38.292 --> 21:39.293
Is that how it works?

21:39.327 --> 21:42.063
Yes, it works that way
sometimes.

21:45.099 --> 21:46.067
We'll be there.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.301
GAMBLE: Are you sure?
We'll be there!

21:47.335 --> 21:50.071
Okay, but you have
to stay under control.

21:50.104 --> 21:52.373
My opinion is this lawyer
would love a mistrial,

21:52.406 --> 21:54.642
and if you jump up in there,

21:54.675 --> 21:56.344
you might very well
give it to them.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.146
All right.

21:58.179 --> 21:59.313
Fine.

22:03.985 --> 22:05.586
RENFORD: Okay, he's coming in.

22:05.619 --> 22:08.256
Dr. Ford, I'm going to ask you
not to speak to him

22:08.289 --> 22:10.191
or hand him any items.

22:24.472 --> 22:26.107
Can they have some privacy?

22:26.908 --> 22:28.943
Dr. Ford is not a suspect.

22:28.977 --> 22:30.311
If she talks at all

22:30.344 --> 22:32.680
and it appears like she's trying
to pass coded information,

22:32.713 --> 22:33.848
she might become one.

22:33.882 --> 22:36.717
She is here to observe.
Now, that's D. O. J. rules.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.686
HABIB: You have two children
to care for.

22:38.719 --> 22:41.589
Don't say anything,
understand?

22:44.058 --> 22:45.559
Why don't we all sit down?

22:48.963 --> 22:51.399
Mr. Habib,
I'm Rebecca Washington.

22:51.432 --> 22:54.068
I'm your lawyer.

22:54.102 --> 22:55.736
We're about to have
a hearing.

22:56.971 --> 23:00.208
I didn't ask for either
a hearing or a lawyer.

23:02.911 --> 23:05.313
Your wife hired me.

23:05.346 --> 23:06.547
She should not have.

23:09.951 --> 23:13.922
Is my--is my wife, my sons,
are they all right?

23:13.955 --> 23:15.256
Have they been harmed?

23:15.289 --> 23:18.226
No, we're fine.

23:18.259 --> 23:19.727
Would you tell him
we're fine, please?

23:22.196 --> 23:24.899
Do you have any idea
why you're here?

23:25.900 --> 23:26.700
Miss, uh...

23:26.734 --> 23:28.402
Washington.

23:29.437 --> 23:31.472
Help my wife understand,

23:31.505 --> 23:34.608
I did what I did
because it was right.

23:35.476 --> 23:38.880
Bill, what are you
talking about?

23:38.913 --> 23:41.515
Tell the judge
I'm ready to proceed.

23:45.819 --> 23:50.224
I'd see her in the park by
campus, you know, just jogging.

23:50.258 --> 23:51.692
I'd wave.

23:51.725 --> 23:54.428
One time, she stopped,
and we just talked a little.

23:54.462 --> 23:57.165
YOUNG: Tell us about
your relationship.

23:57.198 --> 23:59.667
JOHNSON: We'd meet late at night
when nobody was around.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.335
When it got colder,

24:01.369 --> 24:04.072
that's when she started
inviting me over to her place.

24:04.105 --> 24:06.074
And what would you do there?

24:06.107 --> 24:09.911
We'd talk, watch television.

24:09.944 --> 24:13.915
After a while,
we started having sex.

24:13.948 --> 24:16.117
She said...

24:16.150 --> 24:19.220
well, she said she always
wanted to be with a black man.

24:19.954 --> 24:21.722
So, you know...

24:21.755 --> 24:24.425
YOUNG: Turning your attention
to November 19th,

24:24.458 --> 24:27.395
the day Ms. McLaughlin
was killed,

24:27.428 --> 24:28.762
did you see her that day?

24:28.796 --> 24:31.332
Yes, outside the market.

24:31.365 --> 24:35.336
I offered to carry her bags,
like I'd done before,

24:35.369 --> 24:36.905
but she said she couldn't
see me anymore.

24:36.938 --> 24:38.572
Did she say why?

24:38.606 --> 24:41.642
No, so I followed her,
just trying to talk.

24:42.576 --> 24:43.744
When we got to her apartment,

24:43.777 --> 24:45.779
she said
she was seeing another guy.

24:45.813 --> 24:48.816
I begged her
not to break us up.

24:48.850 --> 24:51.052
We argued for a little bit,

24:51.085 --> 24:53.121
and she said
that she loved me.

24:53.787 --> 24:55.957
YOUNG: Did you make love
to her that day, sir?

24:55.990 --> 24:57.926
Yes.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.161
Afterwards, she said
she was gonna break up

25:00.194 --> 25:01.762
with that other guy
that night,

25:01.795 --> 25:04.966
that he was supposed to be
coming over that night.

25:04.999 --> 25:07.201
When I left, she was alive.

25:08.636 --> 25:09.904
YOUNG: Thank you, sir.

25:17.545 --> 25:19.914
Do you know if anyone
ever saw you two at the park

25:19.948 --> 25:21.149
the day you met?

25:21.182 --> 25:22.851
I don't know.

25:22.884 --> 25:24.886
Do you know if anyone
ever saw you at the apartment?

25:24.919 --> 25:27.355
No, I always came
over there late at night.

25:27.388 --> 25:29.657
Anyone know anything
about the relationship?

25:29.690 --> 25:31.993
No. She liked
to keep it secret.

25:32.026 --> 25:35.897
So nobody can verify
a single part of your story?

25:35.930 --> 25:38.499
I guess because of our
different social places

25:38.532 --> 25:41.235
or whatever
you want to call it,

25:41.269 --> 25:44.973
you know, she just liked
to keep it between us.

25:45.006 --> 25:46.740
Mr. Johnson...

25:48.609 --> 25:50.478
this is your booking photo.

25:50.511 --> 25:52.513
This is what you looked like

25:52.546 --> 25:55.216
the day after Linda McLaughlin
was killed, is that correct?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.650
Objection--relevance.

25:56.684 --> 25:57.651
Overruled.

25:57.685 --> 25:59.620
I was upset when
that picture was taken.

25:59.653 --> 26:01.255
GAMBLE:
You were homeless, filthy,

26:01.289 --> 26:03.357
off your meds,
yet you expect us--

26:03.391 --> 26:04.292
I'm not crazy!

26:04.325 --> 26:06.060
You expect the jury to believe

26:06.094 --> 26:08.462
the victim fell
in love with this,

26:08.496 --> 26:11.732
voluntarily had sex with this,

26:11.765 --> 26:14.435
willingly invited this
into her apartment,

26:14.468 --> 26:15.303
her life, her bed?

26:15.336 --> 26:16.437
Objection!

26:16.470 --> 26:17.405
Sustained.

26:17.438 --> 26:19.707
Linda was a beautiful person.

26:19.740 --> 26:23.311
She loved
all kinds of people.

26:23.344 --> 26:25.413
She didn't care
what they looked like.

26:36.424 --> 26:38.026
You need to call
that Collins girl.

26:38.059 --> 26:41.395
It could end up backfiring on us
with some of the jurors.

26:41.429 --> 26:43.364
We can't afford to be that
sensitive, Helen.

26:43.397 --> 26:45.133
We try and be P. C.
Here, we lose.

26:45.166 --> 26:48.569
Collins refutes what Johnson
just testified to.

26:48.602 --> 26:50.204
She's all we have
to refute it.

26:50.238 --> 26:53.174
Part of our strategy is
presenting sympathetic parents.

26:53.207 --> 26:54.475
It can't be about that now.

26:54.508 --> 26:56.410
It's about showing there
was never a relationship

26:56.444 --> 26:59.047
between Johnson
and the victim, period.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.849
You know Eugene's
ready for her.

27:00.882 --> 27:04.285
We have no choice.
We need that witness.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.586
Call her.

27:09.657 --> 27:12.126
WASHINGTON: Do you know
why you're in custody?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.361
The government believes

27:13.394 --> 27:15.596
I may have information
about someone, I think.

27:15.629 --> 27:17.298
I don't really know.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.568
He didn't do anything, but he
may have known some people

27:20.601 --> 27:23.771
with ties to others who are
wanted for questioning.

27:23.804 --> 27:25.940
WASHINGTON: What information?
What do they think you know?

27:25.974 --> 27:27.008
MCNALLY: Objection.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.343
Sustained. You can't know that,
Ms. Washington.

27:30.578 --> 27:32.780
You haven't talked
to your family in weeks.

27:32.813 --> 27:35.016
Why did they keep you
from talking to your family?

27:35.049 --> 27:37.818
They didn't.
I chose not to call my family.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.321
Why?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.123
I was told
anyone I spoke with

27:42.156 --> 27:43.724
would be subject
to investigation.

27:43.757 --> 27:45.793
I do not want to bring
my family into this.

27:45.826 --> 27:47.795
My wife and children
were born here.

27:47.828 --> 27:51.599
They have no connection
to any Arab...

27:51.632 --> 27:52.834
other than me.

27:52.867 --> 27:55.036
Have you been interviewed?

27:55.069 --> 27:56.637
Many times.

27:56.670 --> 28:00.241
Did you know you had the right
to have an attorney present?

28:01.409 --> 28:02.810
I waived my rights.

28:05.546 --> 28:07.916
You waived them?

28:07.949 --> 28:09.050
Voluntarily?

28:09.083 --> 28:10.684
I talked to them
on my own.

28:10.718 --> 28:12.887
They didn't force me,
not in any way.

28:12.921 --> 28:14.889
Did they make you afraid?

28:14.923 --> 28:17.425
Am I fearful?
I guess I would say yes,

28:17.458 --> 28:20.261
but I have made
all my decisions voluntarily.

28:20.294 --> 28:25.033
You voluntarily refused
to speak to your family?

28:25.066 --> 28:28.069
I explained that.
I didn't want to involve them.

28:28.102 --> 28:31.305
Calling your wife
to say you're okay,

28:31.339 --> 28:33.107
that would involve her?

28:34.108 --> 28:36.077
I couldn't be sure
it wouldn't.

28:36.110 --> 28:39.047
Mr. McNally, if Mr. Habib
is not a suspect

28:39.080 --> 28:41.649
and he's cooperating,
why can't he go home?

28:41.682 --> 28:44.452
We're learning new information
all the time

28:44.485 --> 28:46.454
from wiretaps,
overseas contacts.

28:46.487 --> 28:48.822
He may know more than
even he realizes.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.492
But he'll stay available to you.
He's not going anywhere.

28:51.525 --> 28:53.494
He volunteered to help.

28:53.527 --> 28:55.363
We can't risk losing him.

28:55.396 --> 28:57.631
Look, we are trying to get
the information we need

28:57.665 --> 29:00.568
to stop the potential murder
of thousands of Americans.

29:00.601 --> 29:02.937
That means depriving some
Americans of their civil rights.

29:02.971 --> 29:04.973
I don't like it,
but that's how it is.

29:05.006 --> 29:07.708
You're imprisoning
an innocent man.

29:07.741 --> 29:10.478
HABIB:
Miss Washington, enough!

29:10.511 --> 29:12.080
If my country thinks
I should be here,

29:12.113 --> 29:14.815
I will stay here!

29:14.849 --> 29:16.517
Your country?

29:16.550 --> 29:20.288
Yes, I am an American!
I am serving my country!

29:21.789 --> 29:24.225
Mr. Habib...

29:24.258 --> 29:25.726
have you been tortured?

29:25.759 --> 29:26.928
No.

29:26.961 --> 29:29.430
Have you been mistreated
physically in any way?

29:29.463 --> 29:30.364
No!

29:30.398 --> 29:32.300
And you do not oppose
being held further?

29:32.333 --> 29:33.701
I do not!
Your Honor, please wait.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.336
WINWOOD:
Miss Washington, I'm sorry.

29:35.369 --> 29:37.638
In war, law is silent.

29:38.806 --> 29:40.208
Habeas motion is denied.

29:40.241 --> 29:42.476
Mr. Habib shall
remain in custody.

29:49.517 --> 29:52.786
There is no way Linda McLaughlin
was dating that man.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.621
GAMBLE: You know this?

29:53.654 --> 29:55.123
COLLINS: We were real close.

29:55.156 --> 29:58.492
If she was dating someone,
I'd know.

29:58.526 --> 30:00.428
To your knowledge,
was she dating anyone?

30:00.461 --> 30:01.930
Objection--speculation.

30:01.963 --> 30:02.964
Goes to rebuttal.

30:02.997 --> 30:04.966
We can refute the existence
of a relationship.

30:04.999 --> 30:06.467
Proceed.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.971
She wasn't dating him.

30:10.004 --> 30:10.939
I'm sure.

30:10.972 --> 30:12.640
How do you know?

30:12.673 --> 30:14.275
We talked about it,

30:14.308 --> 30:17.946
about interracial relationships,
on occasion.

30:17.979 --> 30:20.314
She said...

30:20.348 --> 30:24.518
she said she wouldn't date
African-Americans.

30:24.552 --> 30:25.719
Ever.

30:25.753 --> 30:27.922
Those were her exact words?

30:27.956 --> 30:28.822
Yes.

30:28.857 --> 30:29.991
Among other things,

30:30.024 --> 30:32.360
she said her parents would have
a big problem with it,

30:32.393 --> 30:35.029
particularly her dad.

30:35.063 --> 30:36.564
GAMBLE: Thank you, Miss Collins.

30:41.002 --> 30:42.770
You didn't live with her,
did you?

30:42.803 --> 30:44.172
No.

30:44.205 --> 30:47.108
So it's possible she was seeing
him without you knowing?

30:47.141 --> 30:50.078
No. That's not possible.

30:51.379 --> 30:53.047
How can you know that?

30:53.081 --> 30:54.582
Because of what she said.

30:54.615 --> 30:56.885
That her parents
would have a problem

30:56.918 --> 30:58.219
with her dating a black man,

30:58.252 --> 30:59.487
Yes.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.154
YOUNG: Especially her father?

31:00.188 --> 31:00.922
COLLINS: Yes.

31:00.955 --> 31:02.123
Her father's a racist,
isn't he?

31:02.156 --> 31:03.691
GAMBLE: Objection.
YOUNG: Goes to bias.

31:03.724 --> 31:04.893
What bias?

31:04.926 --> 31:07.061
The victim concealed her
relationship with my client

31:07.095 --> 31:09.363
because she feared her father,
who hates black people.

31:09.397 --> 31:10.431
GAMBLE: Objection!

31:10.464 --> 31:12.901
KITTLESON: I'm warning you both
for the last time.

31:12.934 --> 31:15.236
Mr. Young, move on.

31:15.803 --> 31:18.172
Miss Collins...

31:18.206 --> 31:19.908
when you
and Linda McLaughlin spoke

31:19.941 --> 31:22.911
of interracial relationships,

31:22.944 --> 31:24.412
what was your position
on the matter?

31:26.314 --> 31:27.849
I was against them, too.

31:27.882 --> 31:30.218
YOUNG: So Linda, knowing this,

31:30.251 --> 31:31.986
maybe she didn't want you
to find out

31:32.020 --> 31:33.321
about her and Daryl either.

31:33.354 --> 31:34.889
GAMBLE:
Objection--Speculation.

31:34.923 --> 31:36.224
Overruled.

31:36.257 --> 31:38.359
Maybe because she knew
you were a bigot, Ms. Collins,

31:38.392 --> 31:40.728
Linda just said she didn't want
to date a black man.

31:40.761 --> 31:41.795
Objection!

31:41.829 --> 31:43.797
That is more than enough,
Mr. Young.

31:43.832 --> 31:45.967
The witness may step down.

31:52.073 --> 31:54.242
I assume the parties rest?

31:54.275 --> 31:55.809
We have a rebuttal witness.

31:55.844 --> 31:57.011
And who is that?

31:57.045 --> 31:59.180
YOUNG: Joe McLaughlin,
the victim's father.

31:59.213 --> 32:01.082
Objection!
I have legitimate reasons

32:01.115 --> 32:02.650
to call him.
Name one.

32:02.683 --> 32:05.219
The D. A.'s own witness just said
the daughter had a motive

32:05.253 --> 32:07.388
to hide her relationship
from her father.

32:07.421 --> 32:08.923
I'm allowed to pursue that.

32:08.957 --> 32:10.191
GAMBLE: I would ask
the court for time

32:10.224 --> 32:11.359
to consult
with Mr. McLaughlin...

32:11.392 --> 32:13.394
You can't have that right.
He's my witness.

32:13.427 --> 32:16.030
KITTLESON: Enough!

32:16.064 --> 32:18.499
Mr. McLaughlin...

32:18.532 --> 32:21.035
after lunch,
you will take the stand.

32:35.349 --> 32:36.951
MAN: Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

32:36.985 --> 32:39.153
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

32:39.187 --> 32:40.054
I do.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.856
Be seated.

32:45.626 --> 32:46.928
Mr. McLaughlin,

32:46.961 --> 32:50.131
did you pressure your daughter
not to date black men?

32:53.902 --> 32:55.603
I asked you a question, sir.

32:56.537 --> 32:59.073
My daughter was killed by that
man sitting right there.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.508
Move to strike--
nonresponsive.

33:00.541 --> 33:03.077
Instruct the witness
to answer the question.

33:03.111 --> 33:05.546
Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

33:05.579 --> 33:08.616
Please answer the question,
Mr. McLaughlin.

33:09.851 --> 33:13.487
I never pressured my daughter
not to date black men.

33:13.521 --> 33:15.623
Well, was she mistaken
or did she lie

33:15.656 --> 33:17.725
when she told Betsy Collins
that you would have trouble

33:17.758 --> 33:19.961
with her having
an interracial relationship

33:19.994 --> 33:21.695
like the one she had
with my client?

33:21.729 --> 33:22.663
Objection.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.966
There was no relationship
with your client

33:24.999 --> 33:26.134
Was she afraid to tell you?

33:26.167 --> 33:27.035
Objection!

33:27.068 --> 33:28.802
I am not a racist,
Mr. Young.

33:28.837 --> 33:31.472
But you were against
interracial relationships?

33:32.340 --> 33:35.844
Like any father, I wanted my
daughter to have a good life.

33:35.877 --> 33:38.012
I was really worried about
interracial relationships

33:38.046 --> 33:39.613
because they were subject
to bigotry,

33:39.647 --> 33:41.582
hatred for the couple.

33:41.615 --> 33:43.684
I mean, for the kids.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.053
I see.

33:45.086 --> 33:47.755
So to protect her from bigots,
you decided to become one?

33:47.788 --> 33:49.590
GAMBLE: Objection!
YOUNG: Withdrawn.

33:49.623 --> 33:51.825
She knew you'd disapprove
if she did date a black man,

33:51.860 --> 33:53.294
didn't she, Mr. McLaughlin?

33:53.327 --> 33:55.629
She never dated that man!

33:55.663 --> 33:57.198
Because if she did,

33:57.231 --> 33:59.133
she would have told you
all about it, right,

33:59.167 --> 34:02.336
knowing how open-minded
you can be?

34:02.370 --> 34:04.438
If he's black,

34:04.472 --> 34:06.807
it had to be rape,

34:06.841 --> 34:08.076
right, Mr. McLaughlin?

34:08.109 --> 34:09.143
Objection!

34:09.177 --> 34:10.478
Sustained.

34:18.819 --> 34:20.321
He agreed to be held.

34:20.353 --> 34:22.223
For what?!

34:22.255 --> 34:24.058
He didn't do anything.

34:26.027 --> 34:28.262
Are they torturing
witnesses now, Rebecca?

34:28.295 --> 34:29.931
I cannot believe that.

34:29.964 --> 34:33.167
I read it in the paper.
Maybe the CIA is doing that now.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.869
You asked
the question yourself.

34:34.902 --> 34:38.072
Doctor, you know your husband,
his personality, his demeanor.

34:38.106 --> 34:40.007
Did he seem like
maybe he'd been tortured?

34:42.110 --> 34:44.245
He seemed...

34:44.277 --> 34:46.580
He seemed what?

34:46.614 --> 34:50.952
Intent on proving
his loyalty to America.

34:53.821 --> 34:55.755
Desperate to prove it.

35:03.197 --> 35:06.534
Closing arguments
are not evidence.

35:06.567 --> 35:10.471
Nothing the lawyers
say is evidence.

35:10.504 --> 35:15.543
Your verdict must be based
solely on evidence.

35:15.576 --> 35:18.212
YOUNG: They had an affair.

35:18.246 --> 35:21.649
The prosecution refuses
to believe it. Why?

35:21.682 --> 35:24.718
The man in the parking lot sees
a black man with a white woman

35:24.752 --> 35:27.188
and assumes he's hassling her.

35:27.221 --> 35:29.823
The woman in the hallway can't
tell one black man from another,

35:29.858 --> 35:32.493
so the prosecution
would have you believe

35:32.526 --> 35:33.962
that the only relationship

35:33.995 --> 35:36.831
that could be between
a black man and white woman

35:36.865 --> 35:39.267
is killer and victim.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.602
GAMBLE: The defendant
was seen arguing with her

35:41.635 --> 35:43.271
in the parking lot.

35:43.304 --> 35:47.976
A witness watched him
follow her home angry.

35:48.009 --> 35:51.312
He was seen coming out
of Linda's apartment.

35:51.345 --> 35:53.781
His prints were on
the murder weapon.

35:53.814 --> 35:56.517
His semen was found
in the victim.

35:56.550 --> 36:00.188
Neither the race
of the defendant nor the victim

36:00.221 --> 36:04.192
should have any bearing
on your verdict.

36:04.225 --> 36:05.826
It is irrelevant

36:05.860 --> 36:08.596
and must not be considered
by you in any way.

36:08.629 --> 36:10.899
YOUNG:
Linda McLaughlin had a motive

36:10.932 --> 36:13.467
to deny her relationship
with my client.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.538
She feared her father.

36:17.571 --> 36:20.741
Her father
doesn't like black people.

36:20.774 --> 36:24.778
There's no evidence to suggest
someone else killed her.

36:24.812 --> 36:28.216
No one else's prints were found
anywhere in the apartment.

36:28.249 --> 36:32.921
The evidence points
only to the defendant.

36:32.954 --> 36:35.123
Of course his prints
were on the lamp.

36:35.156 --> 36:37.058
He would visit her.
He slept with her.

36:37.091 --> 36:39.493
They only looked
for one defendant.

36:39.527 --> 36:43.031
Daryl Johnson is on trial,
ladies and gentlemen,

36:43.064 --> 36:46.567
simply because he's black.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.936
All we ask is...

36:52.573 --> 36:53.842
honor your oath.

37:05.954 --> 37:06.654
Hey.

37:06.687 --> 37:07.688
WASHINGTON: Hey.

37:10.158 --> 37:11.259
What's happening?

37:11.292 --> 37:13.027
Nothing.

37:13.061 --> 37:15.529
He's in custody, he's instructed
me not to challenge it,

37:15.563 --> 37:17.265
and he's staying in custody.

37:17.298 --> 37:18.266
For how long?

37:18.299 --> 37:21.602
I don't know.
The case is over.

37:21.635 --> 37:25.273
I'm working on the neely
interrogatories now anyway.

37:25.306 --> 37:27.241
Okay.
You all right?

37:27.842 --> 37:29.743
Why wouldn't I be all right?

37:30.344 --> 37:31.379
Rebecca.

37:36.017 --> 37:38.486
We're back.

37:38.519 --> 37:39.587
We're back to...

37:39.620 --> 37:41.489
Interning people,

37:41.522 --> 37:44.358
sticking them in prison because
of where they were born.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.794
It happened in World War II
with the Japanese-Americans,

37:46.827 --> 37:48.429
and it's back.

37:48.462 --> 37:49.663
The government will apologize
for it later,

37:49.697 --> 37:51.165
but then it'll be too late.

37:51.199 --> 37:53.968
Innocent people are having
their lives ruined now.

37:57.071 --> 38:01.109
Mr. Habib--he thinks being
a good American

38:01.142 --> 38:04.278
is giving up your rights,
not fighting for them.

38:07.281 --> 38:08.682
Most people know

38:08.716 --> 38:10.751
that Arab-Americans
are Americans, Rebecca,

38:10.784 --> 38:12.486
and that they're our neighbors,

38:12.520 --> 38:15.623
but everyone's afraid.

38:17.859 --> 38:20.228
We don't know who we know
and who we don't know and...

38:21.963 --> 38:23.531
we're afraid.

38:25.766 --> 38:28.102
Yeah.

38:28.136 --> 38:29.537
(sighs)

38:29.570 --> 38:31.739
(chuckles softly)
We're back.

38:58.332 --> 39:00.001
KITTLESON:
Let the record reflect

39:00.034 --> 39:01.735
that the parties
are present

39:01.769 --> 39:04.005
and that the jury
has returned.

39:04.038 --> 39:06.307
The defendant
will please rise.

39:08.109 --> 39:11.846
Mr. Forman, as to the charge
of murder in the first degree,

39:11.880 --> 39:13.814
how say you?

39:13.848 --> 39:16.985
Your honor,
the jury has a statement.

39:17.018 --> 39:18.987
You have a what?

39:19.020 --> 39:21.055
We were told it was our civic
duty to serve on a jury

39:21.089 --> 39:24.092
because the constitution
guarantees every defendant

39:24.125 --> 39:27.061
the absolute right to be judged
by a jury of his peers.

39:27.095 --> 39:28.562
This is not a forum for--

39:28.596 --> 39:30.198
FORMAN: We were told
that the American system,

39:30.231 --> 39:31.299
for all its flaws,

39:31.332 --> 39:33.067
is the best system
in the world

39:33.101 --> 39:35.603
because of the concept
of the citizen jury.

39:35.636 --> 39:37.038
Move for immediate reading
of the verdict.

39:37.071 --> 39:39.040
But what we found--
Sir!

39:40.774 --> 39:42.543
You have one more chance

39:42.576 --> 39:45.046
before you risk
a finding of contempt.

39:47.448 --> 39:50.051
Have you all agreed
on a verdict?

39:50.084 --> 39:53.187
What we've agreed on

39:53.221 --> 39:55.990
is that this has been about...

39:56.024 --> 40:00.929
the most appalling spectacle
we have ever seen.

40:00.962 --> 40:02.163
The only thing
that should matter in here

40:02.196 --> 40:06.467
is did the defendant
or did he not commit the crime?

40:06.500 --> 40:08.903
Nobody here cares--
not her, not him.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.142
And not you.

40:14.175 --> 40:16.710
Nothing that's gone on here
has been about giving the jurors

40:16.744 --> 40:21.415
the information they need
to make the right decision.

40:21.449 --> 40:24.652
A girl is dead.
A man's freedom is at risk.

40:24.685 --> 40:28.556
If he killed her, his liberties
should be forfeited,

40:28.589 --> 40:31.725
and we're supposed to decide...

40:31.759 --> 40:34.228
based on what, exactly?

40:36.831 --> 40:39.067
We want justice
for the victim,

40:41.002 --> 40:43.637
but we can't provide it.

40:43.671 --> 40:46.240
KITTLESON: Are you saying
you cannot reach

40:46.274 --> 40:48.176
a unanimous verdict?

40:48.209 --> 40:50.544
No, your honor.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.813
What we're saying
is we refuse to try.

40:54.582 --> 40:55.850
We have not reached a verdict.

40:55.884 --> 40:58.552
We will not reach a verdict.

40:59.687 --> 41:02.490
If you want to hold us
in contempt,

41:02.523 --> 41:03.892
well, there's a certain justice
in that

41:03.925 --> 41:06.094
because contempt
is what we feel.

41:17.038 --> 41:18.606
You are in contempt.

41:18.639 --> 41:22.410
Security, would you please take
the jury into custody?

41:23.744 --> 41:26.314
I declare this a mistrial.

41:26.347 --> 41:28.182
Miss Gamble, you may ask
for a date

41:28.216 --> 41:30.885
to begin the retrial.

41:30.919 --> 41:31.652
(gavel bangs)

41:31.685 --> 41:32.954
We're adjourned.

42:09.790 --> 42:10.791
(knocks on door)

42:17.631 --> 42:18.632
(clears throat)

42:22.303 --> 42:24.772
The judge allowed me
to withdraw,

42:24.805 --> 42:28.776
so for the next trial...

42:28.809 --> 42:32.146
you have my best wishes.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.314
Thank you.

42:36.017 --> 42:38.819
Well, they certainly reached
a verdict on us, anyway.

42:40.221 --> 42:41.990
Yep.

42:43.724 --> 42:47.695
Got a little ugly, but I don't
think we were that out of line.

42:47.728 --> 42:50.899
It's a trial.
What do they expect?

42:50.932 --> 42:52.733
I don't know.

42:52.766 --> 42:53.835
You know jurors.

42:58.072 --> 43:00.708
We can't beat ourselves up
over this, Eugene.

43:04.545 --> 43:06.280
Nope.

43:06.314 --> 43:09.383
Heads high.

43:09.417 --> 43:10.751
Heads high.

43:19.427 --> 43:21.762
(music playing)

43:45.086 --> 43:46.154
WOMAN: You stinker.
