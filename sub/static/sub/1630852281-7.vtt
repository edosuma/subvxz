Whoa.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.206
‐ Wow to the wow…!

12:28.206 --> 12:30.708
‐ That is quite
the puzzle collection, Branch.

12:30.959 --> 12:31.709
‐ Thanks.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.545
They actually belonged to my grandma.

It was our special thing…

12:42.512 --> 12:46.140
<i>Every afternoon,</i>

12:51.396 --> 12:53.106
‐ You see, my little Peach Fuzz,

12:53.398 --> 12:55.024
the great thing about puzzles

12:55.233 --> 12:59.737
is the pieces always fit together
just like they're supposed to.

13:05.952 --> 13:06.995
‐ And she was right.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.998
All those years I spent alone down here,

13:10.373 --> 13:12.417
whenever I was sad or scared,

13:12.917 --> 13:15.378
I would just finish a puzzle
and feel safe again,

13:15.878 --> 13:17.880
like grandma was right there with me.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.175

Sometimes a piece falls off the table.

We'll find it.

we searched pretty thoroughly.

do you want us to search?

the piece by mistake.
