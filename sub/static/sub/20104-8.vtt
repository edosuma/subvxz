WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:04.471
Previously on Prison Break...
We're gonna get you out of here.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.308
MICHAEL: The escape is on.
Go, go, go!

00:07.341 --> 00:08.309
Who the hell is the guy?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.411
He's my brother.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.513
Can't die on me now, Michael,
you know, you're gonna tell me

00:12.546 --> 00:14.248
why I'm your whip hand.
LINCOLN: We found Michael.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.050
He's been busted up real bad.
I got to go.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.185
JACOB: You don't know
what you'd be walking into.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.386
It's not safe.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.154
SARA:
I can't look my son in the eye

00:20.188 --> 00:22.323
and tell him
that I let his father die,

00:22.356 --> 00:24.358
a father he's never met.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.560
Never thought
I'd see this face again.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.763
MICHAEL:
You weren't supposed to.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.232
LUCA:
Lincoln Burrows.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.368
How about you step out

00:34.402 --> 00:36.604
and pay us the 100 grand
you owe us.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.839
There is nobility
in you, Lincoln.
You should rest up.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.509
We're gonna need you.
Didn't know you worried.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.910
About the right things.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.044
SARA:
What's wrong?

00:44.078 --> 00:46.247
It's him. Your husband.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.048
Jacob

00:48.082 --> 00:50.951
is Poseidon.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.520
He's a CIA operative,

00:52.553 --> 00:54.588
deep cover.
He runs a splinter cell

00:54.622 --> 00:55.589
called 21-Void.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.925
He targeted me
for my skills.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.294
Michael, he's with our son
right now.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.062
I'll get to the States
as soon as I can.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.063
Did my husband, Jacob Ness,

01:03.097 --> 01:04.932
ask you to work
on my cell phone?

01:04.965 --> 01:05.933
He said he was looking to find

01:05.966 --> 01:07.135
the people who were stalking

01:07.168 --> 01:10.371
his wife, so I did a data dive.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.072
Where's my son?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.107
I have him.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.775
And whether or not I
have to threaten him

01:14.808 --> 01:18.279
is entirely contingent upon
you putting the gun down.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.452
VAN GOGH:
Kaniel Outis

01:24.485 --> 01:26.487
has been located
on a cargo ship

01:26.520 --> 01:27.921
in the Mediterranean.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.056
They made you.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.324
Run!

01:30.358 --> 01:31.525
(whooshing)

01:35.296 --> 01:37.298
(explosion)

01:43.103 --> 01:45.506
WHIP: Hey!
(whistle blowing)

01:48.008 --> 01:49.277
Hey!

01:52.180 --> 01:54.615
Hey!

02:03.557 --> 02:05.526
Hey, yo,

02:05.559 --> 02:07.361
where we headed?

02:07.395 --> 02:08.696
Marseille.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.466
WHIP: Marseilles.
Marseilles.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.341
JACOB:
I own you, Scofield.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.543
I know everything about you.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.979
Even your most mundane actions,
like the zoo.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.381
What's with you and the zoo?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.649
MICHAEL:
I go there to think.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.619
JACOB:
18 times in the past month?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.721
A lot of thinking.
I was figuring out how to get

02:33.754 --> 02:35.656
your guy out
of Barranquilla.
Hmm.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.558
Turns out he's not just
a rebel leader--

02:37.591 --> 02:39.493
he's a murderous sociopath.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.894
That's the only way
to make omelets.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.896
I need to know more
about our targets.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.200
If I'm facilitating escapes,
we can't have surprises.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.636
Be proud. You and me,

02:48.669 --> 02:51.639
we're changing the world.
Doesn't make it right.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.042
Don't act like you're suddenly
a fan of the status quo, okay?

02:55.075 --> 02:58.679
The system, it's slow,
stupid, and doomed to fail.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.015
That's why you had to bust your
brother out in the first place.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.918
New ink since the
last time I saw you.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.555
Working on a new plan?
No. No new plan.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.890
Just get tired of looking
at empty skin.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.158
Uh-huh.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.994
You know, it was those tats
at Fox River

03:14.027 --> 03:15.429
that caught my eye
in the first place.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.531
I had to know everything
about the man

03:17.565 --> 03:19.433
who wore his plans
on his skin.

03:19.467 --> 03:24.204
In plain sight
yet so mysterious.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.040
The key to real power
is to disappear.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.610
Hi, Professor Ness.
Hello, Claudia.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.045
Yeah, the secret to real power

03:32.079 --> 03:34.382
is to never betray
your intentions,

03:34.415 --> 03:37.618
to wear nothing
on your sleeve.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.119
And to never
let anyone

03:39.152 --> 03:41.722
see your face.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.157
(trilling)

03:55.803 --> 03:57.405
(click)

04:01.775 --> 04:04.244
Come on in.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.119
Next time I'm sitting
in solitary,

04:12.152 --> 04:14.254
I'll think of you in here,
running the world

04:14.288 --> 04:16.089
in air-conditioned comfort.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.725
JACOB: I've spent my
time in the field.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.461
You all set for Myanmar?

04:20.494 --> 04:21.894
It's only a few weeks off.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.130
That's why I'm here.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.965
I want to bring
someone on board.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.668
Oh, really?
The prison camp at Sittwe
is a two-man job.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.903
I've been watching this guy.
He'll be useful.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.605
Watching him? You in charge

04:31.639 --> 04:33.807
of recruiting now?
Trust me.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.243
The last thing I was to do
is suck someone else into this.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.912
He'll have my back
and he'll speed things up,

04:38.946 --> 04:41.915
increase our odds.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.318
(sighs)

04:44.352 --> 04:47.655
Not exactly
a distinguished career.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.657
He's held up well in prison.
He's got a mean streak.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.859
And he grew up without a family.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.193
It means he can be manipulated.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.195
If you're planning
something,

04:55.228 --> 04:57.965
I'll always be
a step ahead of you.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.368
You know that.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.436
I can see everything
in your eyes.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.272
It's what's behind the eyes
that counts,

05:05.305 --> 05:06.540
Professor.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.808
Hmm.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.176
So you're gonna
wait a year

05:09.209 --> 05:11.178
for me to find my
way out of Sittwe?

05:11.211 --> 05:12.846
Or are you gonna
get me a partner,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.748
so we get on with the business
of changing the world?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.661
Done.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.869
(gulls calling)

05:39.673 --> 05:41.475
I need some food.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.876
(phone chimes)
I'm with you.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.313
Linc, it's Sara.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.916
She's back in New York.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.319
LINCOLN:
Are she and Mike okay?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.554
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.574
What is it, Michael?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.576
Something's wrong.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
Yes, you will.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.793
(muffled shouting)

06:38.131 --> 06:40.067
*

07:10.130 --> 07:13.467
I got to get back
to the States.
Slow down.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.968
You're Kaniel
Outis, remember?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.637
You're on every no-fly
list in the world.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.639
Jacob's done something to Sara.
Maybe Mike, too.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.307
How do you know?
That text.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.309
She referred to our son
as Junior.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.144
We agreed we'd
never call him that.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.146
He's baiting
you, Michael.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.482
It worked.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.951
(birds chirping)

07:37.457 --> 07:39.660
Hey, buddy.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.094
Where's Mom?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.163
Oh. I, uh,
dropped her off at work

07:43.196 --> 07:45.265
while you were at school.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.935
That is quite
a pirate ship.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.171
Although it would be
a little hard

07:51.204 --> 07:53.173
to sail with the mast
that far forward.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.509
Your ship might tip over.
The mast has

07:55.543 --> 07:57.310
to be there.
It's not just a ship--

07:57.344 --> 07:58.546
it's a treasure map.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.114
(chuckles)
What do you mean?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.116
It's for Jimmy.
We hide Legos for each other.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.785
I always find his.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.720
He doesn't always find mine.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.890
Wait a second,

08:09.923 --> 08:13.426
how is this drawing a map?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.732
This is the park.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.168
That's the
playground.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.537
And this is the sidewalk.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.674
Impressive.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.209
You put a code
in the drawing.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.179
So, okay,
where did you hide the Legos?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.914
These cannons
are pools at the park.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.585
But there's an extra one,
in the sand.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.852
That's where I buried

08:38.885 --> 08:40.888
the Legos.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.024
Well done, Mike.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.060
Well done.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.199
I've tried everyone. I'm out
of resources in the States.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.434
All my contacts. People who
can go and check on them,

08:54.467 --> 08:55.869
make sure they're okay.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.504
Linc, I got to get home.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.907
I can't spend another two weeks
on a cargo ship.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.341
He's got my
wife and kid.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.910
There may be another way.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.713
You told me about the last
seven years of your life.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.449
Haven't told you about mine.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.588
After Sara got exonerated,
she left Panama.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.625
Me and Sofia stayed behind
and opened a dive shop.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.728
We broke up,
and everything went to hell.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.130
You weren't there to stop me,
so before I knew it,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.098
I was in the old hood,
doing odd jobs.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.566
Odd jobs meaning what?

09:26.600 --> 09:30.137
Moving things from point A
to point B.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.773
For Luca Abruzzi.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.307
John Abruzzi's son.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.943
Yeah.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.613
I just wanted some quick
cash to kick-start my life.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.082
They told me not to
look in the boxes.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.252
But I looked in the boxes.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.088
The amount of fentanyl they're
smuggling out of Europe--

09:48.121 --> 09:50.624
tens of thousands of
pills in every box--

09:50.658 --> 09:52.225
it's just killing people.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.961
So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,

09:53.994 --> 09:55.462
100 grand's worth.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.497
Now you're in hock
to Abruzzi's son.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.667
Yeah. He wants to kill me.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.271
But maybe it's a way to get back
to the States real fast.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.610
LUCA:
You got balls, Burrows.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.180
You actually think
I want to help you?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.514
What if I can get you the $100K?

10:14.547 --> 10:16.449
(scoffs) $100K?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.351
How are you gonna
come up with that--

10:18.385 --> 10:20.353
crawling around
the back alleys of Chicago?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.255
I'm not in Chicago.
I'm in Marseilles.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.591
(chuckles) Marseilles?
Yeah.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.094
I've been working
on a couple deals. I got $100K

10:27.127 --> 10:30.197
in my hand. But I
want off the hook.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.632
Sure you do. How about you get
over here and hand it to me?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.367
That's why I'm calling.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.104
I need to sneak into the States
invisible, like your pills.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.506
Those flights you got
coming out of Europe--

10:39.539 --> 10:43.043
the fentanyl flights--
I need a few seats.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.512
(sighs)

10:47.180 --> 10:49.549
I'll tell you what.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.284
I'll make a few calls.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.686
'Cause either I'm gonna see you

10:52.720 --> 10:54.621
and get that money,
or I'm gonna see you,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.790
and you're gonna get something
a whole lot worse.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.826
(beep)

10:58.859 --> 11:00.894
I can't believe
I'm doing this to myself again.

11:00.928 --> 11:04.765
Difference is this time
you're not alone.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.670
(birds screeching)

11:12.605 --> 11:14.908
God, these things
are disgusting.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.510
What they call 'em again?

11:17.544 --> 11:19.880
Boudin noir.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.015
Not sure what's in them.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.885
I don't think your French is
as good as you think it is.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.388
Yo, be happy
you're not eating snails.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.991
(indistinct chatter)

11:31.024 --> 11:32.359
Hey.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.168
Do you think
they noticed?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.636
Let's not take any chances.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.845
Guys.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.680
Your faces were on the news.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.582
WHIP:
Somebody sees you,
this thing is over.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.884
We got to move, papi.
We got to go.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.386
(phone dinging)

11:59.419 --> 12:01.021
Hold. Luca.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.522
If you can get to Lyon
by midnight,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.424
I can get you on a flight.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.359
I got a warehouse in New York.
You're coming to me.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.727
We'll be there.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.429
Can't decide whether I want you

12:09.462 --> 12:11.298
to have that money
or not, Burrows.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.402
Killing you might be
a lot more satisfying.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.305
JACOB:
Now we know they survived the
strike in the Mediterranean.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.607
We can be pretty sure
he's coming back to Ithaca.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.078
I need some clarification.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.748
Why would he come back here...

12:28.782 --> 12:30.483
to the States

12:30.517 --> 12:32.419
when he's more wanted here

12:32.452 --> 12:34.321
than anywhere else in the world?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.925
Of course.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.827
(clears throat)

12:41.094 --> 12:43.496
Because of them.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.600
He had a life
before he worked for me,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.937
a name-- Michael Scofield.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.704
A family.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.276
And when he went away,
I ended up looking after them.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.645
Ended up... falling for them.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.380
Well...

13:01.614 --> 13:03.350
He wants to kill me.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.686
He thinks I stole his life,
ruined him, which speaks

13:06.719 --> 13:08.621
to his dissociative mind.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.790
I mean, he's a murderer,
a turncoat, a terrorist.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.694
But we'll use it.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.830
I'll be the bait if I have to.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.433
So we can go about taking him
down once and for all.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.169
He's not just gonna
stroll in here.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.338
He's too clever for that.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.241
That's why we got someone
even more clever.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.178
Thoreau?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.846
Guy's a pencil neck.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.182
A pencil neck with insight
into Scofield's plan.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.650
So you, in turn,
can be the hammer.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.687
(door opens)

13:42.722 --> 13:44.057
NELSON:
Screen-grab
of the Skype transmission

13:44.091 --> 13:45.525
he sent from the desert.

13:45.558 --> 13:46.960
He routed the image
through a server

13:46.994 --> 13:49.229
to this BlueHawaii guy,
but it could have been

13:49.262 --> 13:51.031
secretly subrouted
to another, yet

13:51.064 --> 13:53.466
unknown, recipient to use
the information encoded in it.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.735
Information?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.671
It's actually incredible.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.242
Encrypted in the Arabic, the
images are all sorts of stuff.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.311
Apparently,
mundane as hell.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.745
Visiting hours for zoos,

14:05.778 --> 14:07.014
links to defunct message boards

14:07.047 --> 14:08.081
on the Internet.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.682
What message boards?

14:09.716 --> 14:13.486
Truesnuff.com,
Hunterspycamporn.com,

14:13.520 --> 14:16.023
both of which carry... this.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.359
Images of the Harlan
Gaines murder.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.828
What's the bastard doing
rubbing that in our faces?

14:21.861 --> 14:25.032
Of all the things
to encrypt, why that?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.566
What's that get you?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.235
Stegaonographically, a lot.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.337
Steganography is the practice
of concealing information

14:30.370 --> 14:33.240
in the code that
makes up digital files.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.742
Russians do it,
Chinese, everybody.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.510
He's probably thinking
if anyone sees this,

14:37.544 --> 14:39.379
this'll be as far
as they'll look.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.382
But I'm already going inside the
image, breaking down the data

14:42.415 --> 14:44.784
that comprises it.
This is making my head spin.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.254
Point is we put big data,
AI on this,

14:47.287 --> 14:50.090
we can crunch any codes
hidden in there pretty quickly.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.691
And that's what I'm doing.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.627
Nice work, but the truth is,
if I've done my job,

14:54.661 --> 14:58.298
he may reveal his intentions
to us first.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.171
(sighs)

15:16.483 --> 15:19.619
Because I've got him
so far off his game now,

15:19.652 --> 15:22.455
he'll start
to play his cards too early...

15:24.657 --> 15:27.760
Teddy.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.898
"But in return,
you must take a life."

15:31.931 --> 15:33.633
JACOB: ...show us
what the tattoos mean

15:33.666 --> 15:36.736
even before the computers will,
and all the people

15:36.769 --> 15:38.305
he'll be enlisting
for the fight.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.073
You have to call
this pay phone

15:40.107 --> 15:43.410
in France.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.414
(woman speaking French
over P.A. system)

15:47.447 --> 15:50.650
Wait. Chicago?
I thought I was going with you.

15:50.683 --> 15:54.187
Not until you find out
why you're my whip-hand.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.125
I have to go to Chicago
to find that out?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.493
Safe travels.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.762
In the grandiosity of his plan,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
he'll lose sight
of the simplest details.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.366
The phone he texted me with

16:06.399 --> 16:09.336
was located in Lyon,
France last night.

16:09.369 --> 16:13.140
It was turned off in an airport
terminal at 11:51 p.m...

16:18.411 --> 16:23.516
...20 minutes before a direct
flight to New York where

16:23.550 --> 16:24.951
you'll be waiting for him

16:24.984 --> 16:28.321
to put this game
to bed for good.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.527
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Flight 290 to Miami, Florida

16:34.561 --> 16:36.663
will now depart from gate B24.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.198
He just powered back up.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.832
(chiming)

16:39.866 --> 16:42.269
We got him.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.804
Look out!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.239
Back of the plane.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.241
Uh, excuse me!
Excuse me.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.842
You're not allowed...

16:53.180 --> 16:57.617
(phone chirping)

17:01.088 --> 17:03.223
Looks like
the game's still going.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.811
*

17:28.415 --> 17:30.217
It's impressive
how you get these drugs

17:30.250 --> 17:31.951
in the country
just by bribing small-time

17:31.984 --> 17:33.386
airport officials.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.954
I'm guessing
you got about

17:34.987 --> 17:37.524
five million bucks worth
of fentanyl in here.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.192
So what?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.860
You and your brother here
are gonna lecture me?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.095
We were actually
debating on whether

17:42.129 --> 17:43.363
I should give you the 100K
or not.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.100
He says it's blood money.

17:47.134 --> 17:51.037
I agree.
How about you just
shut up and pay me, Burrows?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.340
I don't have it.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.446
Grab his guys, bring 'em
to the back and shoot 'em.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.714
I don't think you want to add
murder to your arrest warrant.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.083
Wait.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.486
Arrest warrant?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.087
That guy out there

18:08.121 --> 18:09.322
is a DEA informant.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.324
We have him in our pocket.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.926
He owes us. He's
got three vans

18:13.960 --> 18:16.463
full of agents
that are waiting for his call.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.065
They're gonna rain down on you
and your pills.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.302
Unless you forgive
my brother's debt.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.504
Then our informant
won't make the call.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.406
Have your brother fighting
your battles, do you?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.808
No.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.777
Why don't you tell your guys
to drop the guns,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.345
and you and I can have it out?

18:32.379 --> 18:35.014
What do you say, Luca?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.151
Scare that guy off.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.320
Bring these guys
to the back.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.921
They make a move,
he makes a call.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.724
Yeah? I think you're bluffing.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.695
I warned you.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.133
We got company.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.303
(engines revving)

18:56.336 --> 18:58.338
(tires squealing)

18:58.371 --> 19:00.807
MICHAEL:
You shoot us, there's
dozens of witnesses now.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.177
Let's go.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.216
(engines revving,
tires squealing)

19:13.253 --> 19:14.987
(tires squealing)

19:20.327 --> 19:23.896
All they had to see
were DEA hats and SUVs,

19:23.930 --> 19:25.532
and they were gone.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.034
Famous Michael Scofield.

19:28.067 --> 19:32.872
Sheba. Thank you
for everything.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.709
You have no idea how happy
I am to see you back home.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.645
We're not home yet.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.747
All right, so what's next?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.149
How do we get
this son of a bitch?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.584
We don't do anything.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.118
Your part is over.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.089
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.891
Tricking Abruzzi's
kid is one thing.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.893
Poseidon-- he knows your face.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.763
Been tracking you
since you went to Yemen.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.398
You've been a warrior,

19:58.431 --> 20:00.099
and I owe you.

20:00.132 --> 20:03.102
But your face is a liability
now to you and your family.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.572
I don't want you
to risk that.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.543
They may know his face,
but they don't know mine.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.182
It's the punch you don't see
coming that knocks you out.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.851
That's my Sheba.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.921
You take care
of her, all right?

20:21.954 --> 20:24.056
I take care of him, you mean.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.625
(laughs)

20:25.658 --> 20:27.527
I love you, brother.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.961
Love you, too.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.400
Be safe,

20:33.433 --> 20:34.901
okay?
You, too.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.604
Bye.
All right.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.539
Well...

20:39.572 --> 20:41.308
when you need me again,

20:41.341 --> 20:44.010
you know where to find me.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.183
(birds singing)

20:52.585 --> 20:54.287
We'll transport her
at 1600 hours.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.756
Lay low until then.
Thank you.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.935
Hey?

21:08.968 --> 21:11.504
That doesn't bother you--
what you just saw in there?

21:11.538 --> 21:13.740
Down in the basement

21:13.773 --> 21:15.908
with his wife, the woman
he says he fell for?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.477
Stop.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.981
I'm done with 21-Void
after this.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.654
After we get Scofield... Outis--

21:27.687 --> 21:29.822
whatever his name is--

21:29.856 --> 21:31.924
I'm done.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.794
That's all I ever wanted,
to get Gaines' killer, but

21:34.827 --> 21:36.763
what he's got
going on in there--

21:36.796 --> 21:39.165
that's not normal.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.600
It's personal.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.802
Something sicker.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.638
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.
You know that.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.843
He hired us because
we are the best.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.713
We can do
whatever we want.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.216
And if we want to
disappear after this...

21:57.249 --> 21:59.386
we can disappear.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.789
There's no getting out.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.058
If you think
that way...

22:06.092 --> 22:08.495
then you're a prisoner, too.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.211
MAN: The guy at the gate
said the vehicles split

22:25.244 --> 22:26.713
five minutes after
they got here.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.682
Five minutes?

22:31.283 --> 22:32.652
Something ain't right.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.053
The product is still here.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.489
Come on.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.191
It was all staged.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.360
Clever.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.929
But Burrows is gonna die for it.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.263
I don't know
how we're gonna find him.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.532
He's in the wind.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.166
Maybe not.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.635
EZ Pass transponders.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.271
Santora's got a guy
at transit authority.

22:52.304 --> 22:55.241
I bet you he can us what roads
they've been taking and when.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.578
Then it's up to us
to comb the neighborhoods,

22:58.611 --> 23:00.346
find the vehicles,

23:00.379 --> 23:03.315
and put a bullet in that
son of a bitch once and for all.

23:12.825 --> 23:16.463
MAN (over PA): Please keep your
baggage with you at all times.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.098
Unattended baggage is a
security risk and may result...

23:19.131 --> 23:21.568
I got a weird request.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.604
If I give you some coordinates,
can you take me to 'em?

23:24.637 --> 23:26.973
See what I can do.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.312
No.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.981
Unless this cab's got pontoons,

23:35.014 --> 23:36.816
ain't gonna happen.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.519
These coordinates are in the
middle of Lake Michigan.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.070
This is it.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.072
LINCOLN:
No lights.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.509
I don't think
they're here, Michael.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.744
Unless that's what
he wants us to think.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.278
Come on.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.150
Get ready to get us out of here
as fast as you can.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.286
SHEBA: Linc.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.127
Be careful.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.162
Thanks.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.906
What's wrong?

24:44.884 --> 24:47.920
That's why Sara never responded.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.463
I wasn't allowed
to contact anyone,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.165
but she was my wife.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.301
I reached out to her in a way

25:02.334 --> 25:03.736
I thought only she would know.

25:06.372 --> 25:09.041
But he knew my ways, too.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.703
*

26:06.265 --> 26:08.267
*

26:37.263 --> 26:38.998
*

26:48.340 --> 26:50.176
(lock clicks)

27:07.727 --> 27:09.729
Nothing.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.368
What are you doing?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.305
That's not
Sara, Michael.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.741
He doesn't know I know that.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.725
That's the right answer.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.727
She's alive.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.029
He must be right there with her.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.231
I'm gonna set a meeting.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.399
And what, you're just gonna
show up and show your face?

27:47.433 --> 27:49.135
Yes.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.704
That means Poseidon
has to show his face, too.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.673
And the endgame begins.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.322
It's high noon, boss.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.591
I'm not seeing him.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.426
And you shouldn't.
He's waiting for us

28:14.460 --> 28:16.662
to push the first piece
out onto the board.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.897
Which would be me?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.368
Maybe not.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.270
Black SUV.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.375
Something I can help you with?

28:29.408 --> 28:32.011
Car service. I'm here to
pick up a lady and child.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.113
They got another ride.
Hit the road.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.682
Are you sure?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.217
Hit the road.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.589
Mark the black SUV.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.724
No need. They were just here
to make you show your face.

28:45.758 --> 28:49.061
Walk away, please. Now.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.230
Okay, act the tiniest bit
flustered.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.866
Now repeat these words back
to me loud enough to be heard:

28:53.900 --> 28:55.201
"They didn't show.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.869
I'm coming back to you now."

28:56.903 --> 28:58.704
They didn't show.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.739
I'm coming back to you now.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.214
Now we have a game.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.116
He's already revealed

29:10.149 --> 29:12.118
his brother, his biggest piece.

29:12.151 --> 29:15.054
Soon he'll have to
show his face. Trailer,

29:15.087 --> 29:17.023
please take him down.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.974
What the...

29:47.820 --> 29:49.822
I lost him.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.190
Hey.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.825
Can you hear me?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.097
Damn it.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.632
No signal.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.206
What are you doing here?

30:07.239 --> 30:08.540
I lost reception in the garage.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.808
Damn it, you fell right into it.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.243
Now they've got
a mark on us.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.057
Black sedan.

30:27.759 --> 30:28.861
He's heading west.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.721
Please!

30:55.754 --> 30:57.056
Please, don't shoot.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.431
You okay?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.401
So that's what the dog
who's destroying my country

31:09.435 --> 31:10.869
looks like.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.373
(phone rings)

31:14.406 --> 31:15.908
Talk to me.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.843
LINCOLN:
Michael, we found the car.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.112
We're on the corner of Third
and Washington by an alley.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.580
Get here now.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.016
He had Sara with him

31:24.050 --> 31:25.918
but we couldn't see her.
What do you mean
you couldn't see her?

31:25.952 --> 31:26.986
SHEBA:
There's no way we could have.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.228
Oh, my God. Sara.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.903
There was no one

31:44.937 --> 31:46.605
in the backseat?
No, the windows

31:46.638 --> 31:48.507
were blacked out--
we couldn't see.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.279
What's that?

31:53.312 --> 31:54.913
My son did this.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.583
He's good.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.119
There might be
something here.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.088
It's a ship.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.622
A pirate ship
with three pirates--

32:03.655 --> 32:05.124
man, woman and a boy.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.892
That's me, Sara and... Mike.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.428
What do you
think that is?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.230
It's a...
it's a many-headed hydra

32:11.263 --> 32:13.065
reaching up to attack.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.900
Think it's Jacob?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.602
Must be.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.170
This is a message.
You're telling me

32:18.204 --> 32:20.239
Mikey's left something
encoded in that?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.674
Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.276
He's got my DNA.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.978
He didn't even know
you were coming.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.180
Sara must have told him.
I don't know.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.349
She must have told him
I was coming.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.152
There's definitely
something here. Definitely.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.696
What is it?

32:44.730 --> 32:47.433
It's one of Luca's guys.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.835
SHEBA:
What?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.837
How the hell did
he track us here?

32:51.870 --> 32:54.473
I don't know.
All I know is all the chickens

32:54.506 --> 32:56.808
are coming home to roost
at the worst possible time.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.377
We got to go.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.513
Linc?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.616
I got it.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.852
This ship, this galleon.

33:06.885 --> 33:10.289
The body of water it's on.
I looked at the map.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.392
There's a lake,
a lake shaped exactly like it,

33:13.425 --> 33:14.660
up in the Finger Lakes district.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.661
"Long lake."

33:15.694 --> 33:17.229
This X

33:17.263 --> 33:19.565
would be on the east shore
of that lake.

33:22.568 --> 33:23.969
He's telling us where he is.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.804
I'm trying to figure out if you
lost your mind or not.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.874
There's only one way
to find out.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.309
Uh-uh.
What?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.144
You're going back
to Buffalo.
What?!

33:32.178 --> 33:34.513
I want you to be with your
family, look after the refugees.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.748
Linc, I'm a part
of this fight, too...

33:43.522 --> 33:44.923
What was that?

33:44.956 --> 33:46.525
It's good-bye.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.995
I could never forgive myself

33:50.028 --> 33:53.132
if something happened to you.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.351
Can I help you?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.885
Yeah.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.355
Can I rent a boat?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.790
I want to take one
out on the lake.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.998
(sighs)

34:40.411 --> 34:42.414
(sighs)

34:43.649 --> 34:46.118
Been thinkin'.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.888
God...

34:49.920 --> 34:52.924
I been thinking.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.960
'Cause a hard bargain's
been presented to me,

34:55.994 --> 34:58.764
and I'm considering something

34:58.797 --> 35:00.966
that's-that's gonna seem like

35:00.999 --> 35:02.968
the old Theodore Bagwell.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.838
T-Bag. (chuckles)

35:09.341 --> 35:12.110
And if that's indeed
what's coming...

35:14.980 --> 35:17.149
...it won't be the work

35:17.183 --> 35:19.951
of a cold-blooded man.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.390
And it won't be for sin...

35:26.858 --> 35:29.127
...or for hate.

35:31.863 --> 35:35.033
If there's blood on my hands,

35:35.066 --> 35:36.968
know this, world...

35:39.571 --> 35:42.007
...it'll be for love.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.145
*

36:08.166 --> 36:09.901
How you doing, buddy?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.203
I'm sick of the lake house.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.838
I want to go home.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.073
I know. I know.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.643
(sighs) We'll go home soon.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.910
Don't worry.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.579
Is Mom okay?

36:20.612 --> 36:22.414
She's, uh...

36:22.448 --> 36:23.882
she's a little
under the weather.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.016
She's just resting.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.855
Everything will be fine, kiddo.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.425
Everything will be back
to normal soon enough, okay?

36:37.028 --> 36:40.098
*

36:54.746 --> 36:56.748
*

37:27.513 --> 37:29.781
Michael, go get him.
And I'll be ready.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.458
Thanks, man,
that was fun.
Yeah, anytime.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.360
Yeah, great. Thank you.

37:42.428 --> 37:45.497
What kind of honorific is Whip?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.668
Who's asking?

37:49.701 --> 37:53.271
A man drawn into this
by destiny.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.974
Okay. How about
you take off?

37:56.007 --> 37:58.243
I don't exactly cotton to
strange men coming up to me

37:58.276 --> 37:59.911
in the middle of
the night, you know?

37:59.945 --> 38:02.448
Only one person calls me
Whip-- you ain't him.

38:02.481 --> 38:05.016
Nobody calls you that.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.321
Man who gave me this hand.
Nobody.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.525
Kaniel Outis.

38:13.559 --> 38:16.161
Or for those of us
who know him,

38:16.194 --> 38:18.397
Michael Scofield.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.102
Who are you?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.738
We all got handles, don't we?

38:28.340 --> 38:31.710
Outis. T-Bag. Whip.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.580
But you're Dave Martin,
aren't you?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.451
How'd you know that?

38:39.485 --> 38:40.886
Huh?

38:40.919 --> 38:43.188
You better start
talking, old man.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.391
You don't want
to tangle with this.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.458
Neither do you.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.626
(grunts)

38:47.659 --> 38:51.397
All your answers are
right in here, all right?

38:52.263 --> 38:54.232
West Virginia honky-tonk,

38:54.265 --> 38:56.234
1991, pretty waitress,

38:56.267 --> 38:59.237
bunch of personal business
between us after closing,

38:59.270 --> 39:01.640
and then I git, 'cause Johnny
Law's breathing down my neck.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.575
Lacking a forwarding address,

39:03.609 --> 39:07.178
I never heard from her again.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.615
What are you trying to tell me?

39:11.282 --> 39:14.319
Scofield was looking
for a partner, combing prisons,

39:14.352 --> 39:17.122
looking for someone
who could handle himself.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.493
And with your
innate ability to thrive,

39:21.527 --> 39:23.995
rising to the top
in even the worst of cages,

39:24.029 --> 39:27.065
you reminded him
of a certain someone.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.535
And so he did
a little research.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.538
Wanted to know
what we all want to know.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.006
Did you learn it...

39:35.040 --> 39:37.443
or was it ingrained in you?

39:37.476 --> 39:39.711
(shuddering breath)

39:39.745 --> 39:42.714
It was ingrained in you, son.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.218
You got it from me.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.424
(panting)

39:54.926 --> 39:56.928
*

40:05.804 --> 40:07.439
(phone rings)

40:08.940 --> 40:11.309
Linc, he's here.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.479
My son.
Thank God.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.481
Hold on.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.651
Hold up.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.419
I think Jacob's coming back.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.256
I can't believe
I'm seeing my son.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.963
Something's wrong.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.132
Sara's here, but...

40:34.165 --> 40:36.702
something's wrong.
Don't do anything.
He's coming back.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.646
I'm going in.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.919
LINCOLN:
It's not Jacob.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.086
You're clear.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.688
Get your family. Get your son.

41:04.496 --> 41:06.064
Burrows!

41:08.634 --> 41:10.401
(grunts)

41:31.056 --> 41:32.858
(whispering):
Hi, Mike.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.595
You know who I am?

41:45.771 --> 41:47.573
I got your map.

41:47.606 --> 41:50.475
I'm gonna get you
and your mother out of here.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.779
I... I didn't draw a map.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.923
Is someone in there
with your mom?
It's not...

42:04.956 --> 42:07.258
We need to run.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.299
