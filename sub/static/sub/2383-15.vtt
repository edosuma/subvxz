<i>Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father,</i>

00:04.150 --> 00:06.203
<i>he decided to stay home a while
to take care of his mother.</i>

00:06.204 --> 00:07.471
But the longer he stayed there,

00:07.471 --> 00:10.207
<i>the more it was like he had
never left Minnesota.</i>

00:10.208 --> 00:12.409
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

00:12.410 --> 00:13.977
Oh, that is too cute.

00:13.978 --> 00:14.978
Say it again.

00:14.979 --> 00:15.979
No.

00:15.980 --> 00:17.281
It's called manners, jerk.

00:17.282 --> 00:19.083
Now, what's-what's going on in New York?

00:19.084 --> 00:20.217
Give me something.

00:20.218 --> 00:22.653
There is one thing that's been going on.

00:22.654 --> 00:28.726
Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.

00:28.727 --> 00:30.527
<i>to save an old building from being torn down</i>

00:30.528 --> 00:33.497
<i>and replaced by a new building that
I'd been hired to design.</i>

00:33.498 --> 00:34.631
And yet somehow, despite this,

00:34.632 --> 00:36.834
<i>we had all managed to become friends.</i>

00:36.835 --> 00:37.868
<i>Which brings us to the night</i>

00:37.869 --> 00:40.237
<i>Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.</i>

00:45.226 --> 00:47.678
I thought the oven was Celsius.

00:47.679 --> 00:48.912
It's okay.

00:48.913 --> 00:50.481
We got hot dogs.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.684
Yeah, and it's not like you
can screw up a hot dog.

00:54.702 --> 00:56.720
Oh, God.

00:56.721 --> 00:58.155
This is so good.

00:58.156 --> 01:01.091
I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.462
Could someone pass the ketchup?

01:05.462 --> 01:07.164
I hope I can pass this hot dog.

01:07.966 --> 01:09.566
Oh.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.135
Oops. Well, looks like someone's

01:11.136 --> 01:13.504
going out in the cold to get more ketchup.

01:13.505 --> 01:16.039
Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.

01:16.040 --> 01:16.907
Which is all gone.

01:16.908 --> 01:18.776
Oops.

01:19.877 --> 01:21.061
All right, I tell you what--

01:21.062 --> 01:23.013
you get this one bottle,
I'll get the next three.

01:23.014 --> 01:24.348
Hmm, tell you what-- no dice.

01:24.349 --> 01:25.582
I'll get the next hundred.

01:25.583 --> 01:26.717
You're not getting out of this.

01:26.718 --> 01:28.285
You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?

01:28.286 --> 01:29.719
I'll get the ketchup.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.636
Robin, I just want you to know,

01:45.637 --> 01:48.138
it's either this story you're
telling me or another game

01:48.139 --> 01:51.308
of Clue against myself, so make it good.

01:51.309 --> 01:52.309
Oh, it's good.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.544
You see, after that night,

01:53.545 --> 01:55.979
none of us heard from Zoey for a while.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.515
<i>Finally, Ted called her up. Hello.</i>

01:58.516 --> 02:00.350
So are we ever gonna see you again?

02:00.351 --> 02:01.452
Because, if I recall correctly,

02:01.453 --> 02:03.754
you owe me a date with your hot cousin.

02:03.755 --> 02:05.556
You still want to do that?

02:05.557 --> 02:07.357
Yes. And we miss you.

02:07.358 --> 02:09.993
But the cousin thing mostly.
Let's get that going.

02:09.994 --> 02:11.445
Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.832
"Cute" means "fat""

02:14.833 --> 02:16.433
She's not fat.

02:16.434 --> 02:19.937
"Not fat" means "ugly""

02:19.938 --> 02:21.472
Oh, here she is.

02:22.774 --> 02:24.842
I take back everything I said.

02:24.843 --> 02:27.377
That girl is extremely attractive.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.829
Hey, Zoey. Hey.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.682
Ted, this is my cousin...

02:31.683 --> 02:33.016
<i> Kids, to be honest,</i>

02:33.017 --> 02:34.551
<i>I don't quite remember this girl's name.</i>

02:34.552 --> 02:35.819
<i>None of us do,</i>

02:35.820 --> 02:37.888
<i>because as this story has
been told and retold,</i>

02:37.889 --> 02:39.857
<i>we've always just referred to her as...</i>

02:39.858 --> 02:41.625
Honey.

02:41.626 --> 02:43.026
Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.

02:43.027 --> 02:44.528
<i>And here's why.</i>

02:44.529 --> 02:47.431
She is a lovely person--

02:47.432 --> 02:51.568
warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible.

02:51.569 --> 02:52.636
It's like, every word

02:52.637 --> 02:54.805
out of her mouth makes you want to be like,

02:54.806 --> 02:57.007
"Oh, honey."

02:57.008 --> 02:58.375
Interesting.

02:58.376 --> 02:59.693
Show your work.

02:59.694 --> 03:02.079
My apartment building is so safe.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.849
My landlord-- he even installed
a security camera in my shower.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.551
Oh, honey.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.686
Maybe I should feel weird
about giving a stranger

03:09.687 --> 03:11.922
my Social Security number,

03:11.923 --> 03:15.225
but the guy's a Nigerian prince.

03:15.226 --> 03:17.361
Oh, honey.

03:17.362 --> 03:20.230
I just had a great TV audition.

03:20.231 --> 03:23.066
Behind the KFC where the
executive producer works

03:23.067 --> 03:24.968
on the weekends.

03:24.969 --> 03:26.737
Oh, honey.

03:26.738 --> 03:31.141
<i>Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.</i>

03:31.142 --> 03:33.343
Oh, honey.

03:33.344 --> 03:34.361
I know.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.246
You just want to wrap her up in a blanket

03:36.247 --> 03:37.481
and give her a cup of tea.

03:37.482 --> 03:38.682
She's, like, this

03:38.683 --> 03:39.983
little lost lamb

03:39.984 --> 03:42.586
who needs to be protected from the wolves.

03:42.587 --> 03:44.054
Speaking of whom...

03:44.055 --> 03:46.790
Yeah, I always get those e-
mails from Michelle Obama

03:46.791 --> 03:49.876
and sometimes Obama himself.

03:49.877 --> 03:52.996
Oh, honey.

03:52.997 --> 03:54.464
<i> So the night went on,</i>

03:54.465 --> 03:56.533
<i>and eventually everyone went home,</i>

03:56.534 --> 03:58.902
<i>except for Ted and Honey.</i>

03:58.903 --> 04:01.138
Wow, an architect.

04:01.139 --> 04:02.439
How fascinating.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.874
Why do they call 'em coasters?

04:04.875 --> 04:06.209
<i>And Barney.</i>

04:06.210 --> 04:10.097
Okay, time to go home.

04:10.615 --> 04:12.549
Ted, a word.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.387
God, I hate these situations.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.238
What are we gonna do about this?

04:19.240 --> 04:20.724
What are you talking about?

04:20.725 --> 04:22.926
Come on, Ted, it's obvious.

04:22.927 --> 04:24.528
Honey's vibing on me.

04:24.529 --> 04:25.596
What?

04:25.597 --> 04:27.564
It's called body language.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.167
Remember when she was touching your arm

04:30.168 --> 04:31.768
and leaning in real close? Mm-hmm.

04:31.769 --> 04:35.973
Well, while that was happening,
the straw in her drink

04:35.974 --> 04:39.075
was pointed right at me.

04:39.944 --> 04:42.012
I mean...

04:42.013 --> 04:43.981
that's as clear as a signal gets,

04:43.982 --> 04:45.132
so...

04:46.985 --> 04:48.752
I'm so sorry, man.

04:48.753 --> 04:51.788
You're right.

04:52.490 --> 04:53.924
She's all yours, buddy.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.759
I'd say hump her brains out,

04:55.760 --> 04:57.694
but someone obviously already has.

04:57.695 --> 05:00.263
<i> Good for you.</i>

05:00.264 --> 05:01.932
Ted Mosby does not take advantage

05:01.933 --> 05:03.300
of poor, helpless honeys.

05:03.301 --> 05:05.102
Yeah, actually, there's another reason

05:05.103 --> 05:06.937
that I didn't go home with her.

05:06.938 --> 05:07.904
Hmm?

05:07.905 --> 05:08.672
He's gay!

05:08.673 --> 05:10.741
Mom, hang up!

05:10.742 --> 05:12.609
I'm sorry.

05:13.645 --> 05:15.078
Go on.

05:15.079 --> 05:16.346
Yeah, actually, there's another reason

05:16.347 --> 05:18.048
that I didn't go home with her.

05:18.049 --> 05:19.216
Hmm?

05:19.217 --> 05:22.252
I'm in love with Zoey.

05:22.253 --> 05:24.221
Oh, my God.

05:24.222 --> 05:25.756
Oh, my God!

05:25.757 --> 05:26.623
Mom!

05:26.624 --> 05:28.809
Sorry.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.150
Ted's in love with Zoey?

05:35.151 --> 05:37.052
But, but she's married.

05:37.053 --> 05:39.087
That boy needs an intervention.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.722
Funny you should say that.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.357
Does anyone know why we're here?

05:42.358 --> 05:43.992
Yeah, who called this intervention?

05:43.993 --> 05:45.694
I did. It's for me.

05:45.695 --> 05:47.579
This is about the coffee breath.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.248
Finally. Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.700
Guys, just let

05:51.701 --> 05:53.502
the man explain how it's all

05:53.503 --> 05:55.470
about his wearing a lady's watch.

05:55.471 --> 05:58.073
It's because I'm in love with Zoey,

05:58.074 --> 05:58.974
and she's married,

05:58.975 --> 06:00.959
so it needs to stop.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.612
And... intervene.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.947
Are you sure it's love?

06:05.948 --> 06:08.350
Remember the ketchup bottle?

06:08.351 --> 06:10.152
<i>She wasn't the one who dropped it.</i>

06:10.153 --> 06:13.989
<i>When she reached for it,
our fingers touched, and...</i>

06:15.525 --> 06:19.227
I knew, right in that moment,
this isn't friendship.

06:19.228 --> 06:21.430
This is love.

06:22.432 --> 06:23.298
Wuss.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.282
Marcus!

06:24.283 --> 06:26.568
This is a private conversation!

06:27.236 --> 06:30.005
So what'd the wuss do next?

06:30.006 --> 06:32.407
This is love.

06:33.276 --> 06:36.144
And this was my grandmother's watch.

06:36.145 --> 06:40.281
Anyway, now I have only one
course of action in front of me:

06:40.282 --> 06:42.150
I have to end my friendship with Zoey.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.635
Isn't that a little harsh?

06:43.636 --> 06:44.486
Harsh?

06:44.487 --> 06:45.520
Robin, a single guy

06:45.521 --> 06:47.456
and a married woman cannot be friends

06:47.457 --> 06:49.424
if one's in love with the other.

06:49.425 --> 06:51.460
Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too.

06:51.461 --> 06:53.678
It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.063
She'll always be around.

06:55.064 --> 06:56.698
Then what am I supposed to do?

06:56.699 --> 06:57.799
Okay, just shut it down.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.317
Okay, just ignore your feelings.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.169
If-If she asks you for ketchup,

07:01.170 --> 07:03.271
tell her to get it her own damn self.

07:03.272 --> 07:05.040
Look, I like Zoey. Without her,

07:05.041 --> 07:08.310
my dinner party wouldn't
have been such a success.

07:08.311 --> 07:09.845
So those feelings of yours--

07:09.846 --> 07:10.879
shut 'em down.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.749
Fine.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.117
I'll shut 'em down.

07:15.118 --> 07:19.321
And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.

07:20.456 --> 07:23.859
Oh, um, that's my other line.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.093
It's not a number I recognize.

07:25.094 --> 07:26.294
So don't answer it.

07:27.797 --> 07:29.131
Yeah.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.632
Oh, my God,

07:30.633 --> 07:32.534
you are so Minnesota.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.136
You can't not answer the phone

07:34.137 --> 07:35.203
because it would be rude.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.304
Well, it would be.

07:36.305 --> 07:38.874
Good-bye.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.909
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

07:40.910 --> 07:41.710
Hey, Marshall.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.677
Barney.

07:42.678 --> 07:43.979
W- What number is this?

07:43.980 --> 07:45.480
I'm up on burners, playa.

07:45.481 --> 07:47.349
Too many crazies had my old number,

07:47.350 --> 07:50.152
so now I'm all about disposable cell phones.

07:50.153 --> 07:52.187
I'll use one for a while, have my fun,

07:52.188 --> 07:54.089
then dump it and get a new one.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.991
And then I'll do the same with my phone.

07:55.992 --> 08:00.328
Hey, uh, so Robin told me about
this whole Ted and Zoey thing.

08:00.329 --> 08:02.297
Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story.

08:02.298 --> 08:04.216
<i>I'll tell you that story.</i>

08:04.217 --> 08:05.867
Hey, Zoey.

08:05.868 --> 08:06.835
Hey.

08:06.836 --> 08:09.087
Ted, this is my cousin...

08:09.088 --> 08:11.039
Honey.

08:13.776 --> 08:15.510
<i> Uh...</i>

08:15.511 --> 08:16.912
Robin's version was...

08:16.913 --> 08:18.747
That is exactly how it happened.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.881
So Ted did his best

08:19.882 --> 08:21.983
to impress her, but as per yoozh,

08:21.984 --> 08:25.487
<i>he bored the pants very much on her.</i>

08:25.488 --> 08:27.606
Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.358
Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits.

08:30.359 --> 08:31.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:31.561 --> 08:34.196
Wow, an architect.

08:34.197 --> 08:35.964
How fascinating.

08:35.965 --> 08:37.232
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:37.232 --> 08:38.866
Rambling architecture anecdote.

08:38.868 --> 08:40.235
Blah, blah,

08:40.236 --> 08:41.703
something about a bridge.

08:41.703 --> 08:42.636
Blah, blah, blah...

08:42.638 --> 08:44.706
Straw.

08:46.509 --> 08:49.211
Coaster.

08:50.079 --> 08:53.081
Okay, time to go home.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.719
Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.

08:58.654 --> 09:00.088
Who's your daddy?

09:00.089 --> 09:02.324
Okay, can we skip this part, please?

09:02.325 --> 09:05.727
Sure, I'll just summarize it.

09:18.274 --> 09:19.274
Okay, that's been

09:19.275 --> 09:20.408
going on a while.

09:20.409 --> 09:22.777
Only way I know how.

09:22.778 --> 09:25.780
Any-who, next day, I'm going into work.

09:25.781 --> 09:27.615
<i>I run into Zoey. Hey, Zoey.</i>

09:27.616 --> 09:30.752
That cousin of yours-- Honey-- yowsa!

09:30.753 --> 09:32.754
I must say, your family
tree has got a couple

09:32.755 --> 09:34.923
of pretty big coconuts.

09:34.924 --> 09:36.091
Thanks.

09:36.092 --> 09:38.176
Yeah, we had a great time last night.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.929
And then just hand stuff
in the morning, so...

09:40.930 --> 09:42.697
Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?

09:42.698 --> 09:44.065
Nope, he let me have her.

09:44.066 --> 09:46.067
I have to say, it was pretty noble of him.

09:46.068 --> 09:49.504
He fell on his sword so
that she could fall on mine.

09:49.505 --> 09:53.141
I won't bore you with the details,
but to summarize...

09:58.948 --> 10:00.649
She hugged me.

10:00.650 --> 10:02.384
What was that all about?

10:02.385 --> 10:03.718
Zoey's in love with Ted.

10:03.719 --> 10:04.953
Marcus!

10:04.954 --> 10:06.288
Wait, hear me out, Marshall.

10:06.289 --> 10:09.324
<i>Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married,</i>

10:09.325 --> 10:11.059
<i>so she tried to push him away</i>

10:11.060 --> 10:13.428
<i>by setting him up with her cousin instead.</i>

10:13.429 --> 10:15.564
<i>But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was</i>

10:15.565 --> 10:17.065
<i>more than her gentle heart could bear,</i>

10:17.066 --> 10:20.835
<i>so Zoey left early,
pricked by love's fickle thorn.</i>

10:20.836 --> 10:22.537
<i>But then, the next morning, upon learning</i>

10:22.538 --> 10:25.740
<i>that Ted had not tasted of
Honey's sweet nectar,</i>

10:25.741 --> 10:29.945
<i>her joy burst forth like a
blossoming flower in spring.</i>

10:29.946 --> 10:31.947
Wow.

10:31.948 --> 10:34.316
Zoey's in love with Ted.

10:34.317 --> 10:38.587
Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that
new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts.

10:38.588 --> 10:40.522
Would you like a Hertz Donut?

10:40.523 --> 10:41.723
Sure.

10:47.129 --> 10:47.829
Hey, where's the...?

10:47.830 --> 10:49.497
No! Aah!

10:49.498 --> 10:50.698
Hurts, don't it?

10:53.636 --> 10:55.370
I can't believe you fell for that, bro.

10:55.371 --> 10:58.173
So Ted's in love with Zoey

10:58.174 --> 11:00.875
<i>and Zoey's in love with Ted?</i>

11:00.876 --> 11:02.544
Well, that-that's not going to work.

11:02.545 --> 11:04.179
I got to call Ted.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.215
Hello.

11:07.216 --> 11:08.350
Listen, Ted, um,

11:08.351 --> 11:10.452
I got to tell you something about Zoey.

11:10.453 --> 11:13.755
Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you
something about Zoey, too.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.424
Hey. I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd take you up

11:16.425 --> 11:18.259
on that beer you're about to offer me.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.028
Can I get you a beer?

11:20.029 --> 11:22.030
Oh, Ted, I'm so busy.

11:22.031 --> 11:23.431
But I guess I got time for one.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.283
Lead the way.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.305
Oh, my God.

11:30.306 --> 11:31.589
What?!

11:31.590 --> 11:33.441
Fridge full of ketchup? How?

11:33.442 --> 11:36.044
How, I ask you?

11:39.548 --> 11:41.449
What?

11:41.450 --> 11:45.120
Listen, Zoey, I, um...

11:46.922 --> 11:48.890
I need to tell you something.

11:48.891 --> 11:50.492
Um...

11:50.493 --> 11:52.427
Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's.
You want anything?

11:52.428 --> 11:54.295
Mom! Get off the phone!

11:54.296 --> 11:56.164
Could you get some more Bugles, please?

11:56.165 --> 11:57.098
Of course, dear.

11:57.099 --> 11:58.233
Marcus, hang up!

11:58.234 --> 12:00.235
Both of you, hang up!

12:00.236 --> 12:02.437
And we need ice cream.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.907
Go on.

12:05.908 --> 12:10.378
I, uh... I can't be
friends with you anymore.

12:11.414 --> 12:14.315
And this may seem strange, but...

12:14.316 --> 12:16.151
you can't ask me why.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.353
Wow.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.990
Okay.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.164
And that was it.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.532
No more Zoey.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.101
Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily.

12:33.102 --> 12:34.502
I should take that.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.470
But, uh,

12:35.471 --> 12:37.138
you're a good guy, Ted.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.191
Hey, baby.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.476
We hate Ted now.

12:41.477 --> 12:43.712
Get on board or the sexting stops.

12:43.713 --> 12:46.181
Ted's a son of a bitch!

12:48.718 --> 12:50.651
Oh, nice.

12:50.652 --> 12:54.022
But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.357
He just, he just ended things with Zoey.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.592
Oh, I know.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.228
But did he tell you the whole story?

13:00.229 --> 13:04.466
I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.969
And you can't ask me why.

13:13.642 --> 13:14.709
Why?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.978
Lily hates you.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.682
You hate me?

13:25.860 --> 13:27.327
That's crazy. I don't hate you.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.830
Well, I know that's not true, Lily.
Ted told me everything.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.665
He... Oh, really?

13:32.666 --> 13:35.969
And-And what did Ted say, exactly?

13:35.970 --> 13:37.871
Lily hates you.

13:38.739 --> 13:41.608
She hates you so much

13:41.609 --> 13:44.411
it's hard to be around you.

13:45.746 --> 13:48.415
So we can't be friends.

13:48.416 --> 13:51.551
Oh, he... Oh, yeah.

13:51.552 --> 13:53.186
Yeah, okay, well,

13:53.187 --> 13:55.922
I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore.

13:55.923 --> 13:57.957
I- I hate you.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.192
Bitch.

13:59.193 --> 14:01.728
I can't believe it.

14:01.729 --> 14:04.631
I really thought you and I were friends.

14:04.632 --> 14:06.266
Lord knows I could

14:06.267 --> 14:07.534
use a friend right now.

14:07.535 --> 14:10.203
I've been going through
some pretty difficult stuff.

14:10.204 --> 14:12.839
Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
I don't know.

14:13.841 --> 14:15.575
Well, you did the right thing, baby.

14:15.576 --> 14:17.911
Not entirely.

14:17.912 --> 14:20.213
Zoey, wait!

14:20.214 --> 14:21.748
I don't hate you!

14:21.749 --> 14:22.782
We just

14:22.783 --> 14:25.919
can't be friends anymore because...

14:25.920 --> 14:27.754
Robin hates you.

14:29.590 --> 14:30.790
And that's Robin on the other line.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.058
Oh, well, I'll let you take that.

14:32.059 --> 14:33.026
Love you, baby!

14:33.027 --> 14:35.395
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.814
Listen, Robin. I know.
I apologize for my wife.

14:37.815 --> 14:39.165
She never should have...

14:39.166 --> 14:41.501
Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.

14:41.502 --> 14:42.652
Me?

14:42.653 --> 14:44.270
You dragged me into this?!

14:44.271 --> 14:45.538
You just went through a tragedy.

14:45.539 --> 14:47.574
It's not like she's gonna call you up and...

14:48.709 --> 14:50.460
Oh, God, that's my other line.

14:50.461 --> 14:53.112
Oh, God, it's a 917 number,
and I don't recognize it!

14:53.113 --> 14:54.180
I think it's Zoey!

14:54.181 --> 14:55.348
Just don't answer it.

14:55.349 --> 14:57.517
I can't not answer. It's impolite.

14:57.518 --> 14:58.751
Marshall, you can beat this.
I can't turn my back

14:58.752 --> 15:00.019
on politeness. You don't have to answer.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.554
You can just let it ring.
Good manners are what

15:01.555 --> 15:02.622
separate us from those
"elbows on the table" Wisconsinites.

15:02.623 --> 15:03.857
You can do this. I believe in you.

15:03.858 --> 15:06.192
Don't do it, Marshall! I'm sorry, Robin!

15:06.193 --> 15:08.061
Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.

15:08.062 --> 15:11.164
Hi. I spent the night
with your friend Barney

15:11.165 --> 15:13.766
and he accidentally left his phone

15:13.767 --> 15:15.935
in my apartment, in the garbage.

15:15.936 --> 15:17.103
But I've been

15:17.104 --> 15:18.438
going through all of his contacts

15:18.439 --> 15:20.507
because I'm sure he wants
to get in touch with me.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.009
After all, he told me, uh...

15:23.010 --> 15:24.811
I was his first.

15:24.812 --> 15:26.846
Oh, honey.

15:26.847 --> 15:28.781
Oh! Honey!

15:28.782 --> 15:30.450
Zoey's cousin.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.718
Hi.

15:31.719 --> 15:32.752
Listen, um, about Barney...

15:32.753 --> 15:34.854
Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.

15:34.855 --> 15:37.090
Who's your daddy?

15:37.091 --> 15:39.659
Oh...

15:39.660 --> 15:41.127
Who's your daddy?

15:41.128 --> 15:43.863
I don't know.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.102
I guess he recently decided
to get in touch with his dad.

15:49.103 --> 15:51.437
His mom gave him the guy's address.

15:51.438 --> 15:54.057
So I wrote him a letter.

15:54.058 --> 15:56.242
And I poured my heart out.

15:56.243 --> 15:59.979
And I gave him my number
and I told him to call me.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.815
And he still hasn't called me.

16:02.816 --> 16:04.951
Oh, honey.

16:04.952 --> 16:06.953
I mean, I shouldn't be surprised.

16:06.954 --> 16:09.822
Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.

16:09.823 --> 16:11.524
Oh, honey.

16:11.525 --> 16:13.326
I mean,

16:13.327 --> 16:16.563
why else would he let 30 years go by?

16:16.564 --> 16:17.997
He's ashamed

16:17.998 --> 16:20.833
to have me as a son.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.869
Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you.

16:23.870 --> 16:26.639
He's ashamed of himself.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.807
I mean, look at you.

16:27.808 --> 16:29.842
You're do so great without him.

16:29.843 --> 16:32.679
I mean, you have an airline

16:32.680 --> 16:35.281
and three Nobel Prizes,

16:35.282 --> 16:37.584
and you play for the Yankees.

16:37.585 --> 16:40.353
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.

16:40.354 --> 16:42.255
Four. See?

16:42.256 --> 16:43.856
That is impressive.

16:43.857 --> 16:45.892
I mean, how many does he have?

16:45.893 --> 16:47.360
Only three.

16:47.361 --> 16:49.729
Well, there you go.

16:49.730 --> 16:53.066
Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you,

16:53.067 --> 16:56.169
do you have any idea what
kind of difficult stuff

16:56.170 --> 16:57.403
Zoey's been going through?

16:57.404 --> 16:59.272
Oh, I can't tell you about that.

16:59.273 --> 17:01.474
The only people that are allowed to know

17:01.475 --> 17:04.711
are me, Zoey and her therapist.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.714
I am her therapist.

17:07.714 --> 17:10.782
Oh! Well, in that case...

17:14.555 --> 17:17.757
Uh, okay, listen, I think we've
made great progress for today.

17:17.758 --> 17:20.108
I got to go. Bye.

17:21.395 --> 17:22.729
Mom! Marcus!

17:25.499 --> 17:27.300
What's this really about?

17:27.300 --> 17:29.002
I told you.

17:29.003 --> 17:30.403
Lily hates you.

17:30.404 --> 17:31.471
I think you hate me.

17:31.472 --> 17:33.373
I think you have some big problem with me,

17:33.374 --> 17:35.742
and you're too chicken
to come out and say it.

17:37.144 --> 17:38.544
All right.

17:38.545 --> 17:40.847
Yes.

17:40.848 --> 17:43.683
I... hate you.

17:43.684 --> 17:45.652
Great.

17:45.653 --> 17:47.887
See?

17:47.888 --> 17:49.422
Was that so hard?

17:53.727 --> 17:55.461
Zoey.

17:55.462 --> 17:56.962
Can you at least tell me why?

17:56.963 --> 17:58.631
Because I'm racking my brain here,

17:58.632 --> 18:00.132
and I thought...

18:01.368 --> 18:04.003
I just want to know why.

18:05.172 --> 18:08.641
So we got Ted and Zoey.
Ted is in love with Zoey.

18:08.642 --> 18:09.842
Zoey has no idea.

18:09.843 --> 18:12.612
Then Zoey's cousin Honey
went home with Barney,

18:12.613 --> 18:13.913
and Zoey was happy about it.

18:13.914 --> 18:15.081
Which tells us what?

18:15.082 --> 18:16.783
Zoey's in love with...

18:16.784 --> 18:18.651
Zoey's in love with Ted
and Ted doesn't know.

18:18.652 --> 18:20.620
So Ted and Zoey--
they're in love with each other,

18:20.621 --> 18:22.622
which would be fine if Zoey wasn't

18:22.623 --> 18:23.923
married to Colonel Mustard.

18:23.924 --> 18:25.324
I mean, The Captain.

18:26.126 --> 18:29.762
Except now, as Honey informs me...

18:29.763 --> 18:30.930
And we miss you.

18:30.931 --> 18:32.298
But the cousin thing mostly.

18:32.299 --> 18:33.433
Let's get that going.

18:33.434 --> 18:36.168
Fine, I will, uh, make it happen.

18:36.169 --> 18:38.838
Good-bye.

18:38.839 --> 18:42.141
Okay. Well...

18:42.142 --> 18:44.677
I guess I'll take it.

18:49.349 --> 18:53.586
Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced.

18:54.688 --> 18:56.055
Which means...?

18:56.056 --> 18:57.924
So help me, Marshall,

18:57.925 --> 19:02.428
if you don't call those two crazy,
mixed-up kids, I will.

19:02.429 --> 19:04.397
Give me that phone.

19:06.233 --> 19:07.366
Why do I hate you?

19:07.367 --> 19:08.534
Are you kidding?

19:08.535 --> 19:10.336
Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me

19:10.337 --> 19:11.571
from realizing a lifelong dream.

19:11.572 --> 19:12.805
So there's that.

19:12.806 --> 19:13.673
Plus, you're stubborn

19:13.674 --> 19:15.441
and-and-and argumentative.

19:15.442 --> 19:19.312
And what kind of name is Zoey, huh?

19:19.313 --> 19:21.080
What is that, short for Zoseph?

19:21.081 --> 19:23.082
Go on, get it.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.434
I'll have more in a second.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.687
Hello.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.772
Oh, hey, Marshall.

19:32.493 --> 19:34.694
Yes, I am.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.097
Yes, I am.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.801
He is?

19:44.471 --> 19:46.873
Bye.

19:46.874 --> 19:48.474
Why was Marshall calling?

19:48.475 --> 19:50.076
Don't worry about it. Go on.

19:50.077 --> 19:52.345
You talk during movies.

19:52.346 --> 19:53.346
You-You-You

19:53.347 --> 19:55.281
sneeze with your whole body.

19:55.282 --> 19:56.415
Uh, to my knowledge,

19:56.416 --> 19:58.684
you do not speak Portuguese.

19:58.685 --> 19:59.852
Well, actually...

20:02.256 --> 20:04.440
You're a show-off.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.428
You better take that.

20:12.783 --> 20:15.034
Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back?

20:15.035 --> 20:17.303
I'm out in the hallway with...

20:17.304 --> 20:19.906
She is?

20:23.243 --> 20:24.644
She is?

20:26.346 --> 20:30.338
Marshall, I got to go.

20:53.181 --> 20:54.833
They're kissing.

20:54.834 --> 20:55.798
They're kissing?!

20:55.980 --> 20:57.945
Yeah! They're kissing!

20:58.117 --> 21:00.800
They're kissing, Mom! They're kissing!
