00:15.949 --> 00:17.342
You know anything yet?

00:17.584 --> 00:20.178
- Jim, I asked for privacy.
- Yeah, and I said no.

00:20.261 --> 00:22.044
Look, I'm sorry,
it's just the first time

00:22.081 --> 00:24.043
I ever hoped a pregnancy test
was positive.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.488
It's weird,
it's like praying for an audit.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.241
You didn't want to do this with Gayle?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.146
Uh, no, I didn't want her
to have to deal

00:30.183 --> 00:33.908
with the disappointment
if it was negative, which...

00:33.998 --> 00:35.820
Shit.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.136
- It's positive.
- Oh, come on.

00:38.173 --> 00:39.251
- No, it's positive.
- It is?

00:39.288 --> 00:41.036
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

00:41.143 --> 00:43.569
- What, I don't even know.
- I have no idea.

00:47.023 --> 00:49.357
Hey, Jim, what do you have
in your belly right now?

00:49.394 --> 00:50.798
Oh, well, last night's lo mein.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.089
Why, Gabby, what do you have
in your belly right now?

00:53.241 --> 00:55.357
- My fucking baby!
- Oh, my God!

00:55.377 --> 00:57.576
Oh!

00:58.965 --> 01:01.499
Hey, Gayle, it's me. Are you in here?

01:01.616 --> 01:04.342
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, babe, look.

01:04.944 --> 01:07.345
- Holy shit.
- I know, right?

01:07.382 --> 01:09.843
And I know it took me a little
while to come around at first,

01:09.880 --> 01:11.349
but now that it's really happening,

01:11.426 --> 01:14.060
I have never been more sure
of any decision.

01:14.137 --> 01:15.520
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

01:15.557 --> 01:17.149
I'm joining you. We have to celebrate.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.337
No, we don't want to get all pruney.

01:19.555 --> 01:20.879
Let's celebrate in the living room.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.343
I'm sorry, I couldn't
hold my breath any longer.

01:29.063 --> 01:32.033
But I heard the news, though. Congrats.

01:39.318 --> 01:41.327
Skied high out to shallow right.

01:41.364 --> 01:43.674
Sanchez gets a very late break
on that ball,

01:43.711 --> 01:45.484
and oh, it drops in.

01:45.599 --> 01:47.248
Oden heads on home to score.

01:47.371 --> 01:49.501
That was not
a particularly good showing

01:49.538 --> 01:50.960
for Sanchez, was it, Gabby?

01:51.055 --> 01:52.649
Did he get a poor angle on that ball,

01:52.686 --> 01:54.445
or just a bad read?

01:54.571 --> 01:56.672
Uh, both.

01:58.092 --> 01:59.489
Well, that's very astute,

01:59.526 --> 02:01.248
because so often in today's world,

02:01.285 --> 02:03.768
we force ourselves into
a binary thought process,

02:03.805 --> 02:06.147
when in reality,
two things can be true at once.

02:06.184 --> 02:08.299
Fastball fouled down
the right side this time.

02:08.465 --> 02:09.740
Still, you got to be wondering

02:09.776 --> 02:12.328
what is going through
Sanchez's mind right now.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.874
Oh, probably just reliving
his own failure

02:14.911 --> 02:17.985
over again and again,
just wondering "why me?"

02:18.067 --> 02:20.677
And, like, "what did I do
to deserve this humiliation?"

02:21.517 --> 02:23.123
<i>Williams lines that one out to right.</i>

02:23.160 --> 02:24.628
<i>Manwaring corrals it,</i>

02:24.665 --> 02:26.773
and you can put this one
in the books, folks.

02:26.810 --> 02:29.721
Oakland loses to Kansas City
by a count of 9-1.

02:29.837 --> 02:32.698
Stay tuned for the post game
wrap-up with Sam and Dave.

02:33.156 --> 02:36.116
What is going on with you?
Are you still in shock?

02:36.153 --> 02:38.642
Did you tell Gayle?
Was she... was she excited?

02:38.679 --> 02:40.689
She was surprised.
Everyone was surprised.

02:40.726 --> 02:41.966
Wish I could have been there to see it.

02:42.002 --> 02:44.771
I mean, all this beautiful,
intense female emotion

02:44.808 --> 02:46.335
just cascading forth.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.446
You guys are a... you're a living womb

02:48.598 --> 02:50.650
of love and laughter and light.

02:50.745 --> 02:52.933
This baby's going to have
two mothers, Gabby.

02:52.970 --> 02:56.973
Two women just in it together,
melding their maternal powers

02:57.010 --> 02:59.305
to create the peak
upbringing experience.

03:00.698 --> 03:03.467
Oh, happy times. Just...

03:03.736 --> 03:05.771
happy, happy times.

03:07.119 --> 03:09.700
I'm sorry, I don't want to
hear your 20-minute breakdown

03:09.719 --> 03:11.118
on whatever bullshit you watched

03:11.137 --> 03:12.620
on Discovery Investigation.

03:12.639 --> 03:13.903
Well, you don't have to,

03:13.940 --> 03:17.021
because Dakota loves murder
just as much as I do.

03:17.126 --> 03:18.604
Dakota.

03:18.674 --> 03:20.236
Nobody loves murder!

03:20.388 --> 03:23.395
Look, we are supposed
to be raising a baby together.

03:23.498 --> 03:25.558
When I said that I wanted
to start a family,

03:25.634 --> 03:28.739
I was using it as an excuse
not to move to Oklahoma.

03:28.866 --> 03:31.873
But then you got all
Gabby-like, and super type A.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.719
Found a doctor,
picked the sperm, got injected,

03:34.775 --> 03:36.867
all before we had
a second conversation.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.270
And then, you get pregnant
on the first try.

03:39.307 --> 03:42.867
Like, what non-teenage girl does that?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.673
A goddamn champion, that's who.

03:44.771 --> 03:46.337
And you were there
for all those decisions,

03:46.374 --> 03:47.769
and I'm sorry, but you never said shit.

03:47.823 --> 03:48.932
I did.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.951
I tried to end this
relationship three times,

03:50.988 --> 03:52.372
and you always talked me out of it.

03:52.428 --> 03:54.422
Because you don't make good cases.
Your evidence is weak.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.205
Well, now it's strong.

03:56.489 --> 03:58.356
I think that's why I did it.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.824
I blew up our life because

04:01.135 --> 04:02.819
then you would finally hear me.

04:03.002 --> 04:04.709
Okay.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.569
Then that's... yeah, then fine.
I am ready to hear you.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.017
What are you trying to say?

04:10.162 --> 04:14.290
After 10 years with you, I
get to be new to someone again.

04:14.802 --> 04:17.113
These past six weeks
with Dakota have been

04:17.149 --> 04:21.539
the most passionate and
intense experience of my life.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.948
Like, when was the last time

04:22.985 --> 04:24.525
that we had sex on the kitchen floor?

04:24.562 --> 04:26.304
You had sex on the kitchen floor?

04:26.465 --> 04:27.847
Where else?

04:29.808 --> 04:33.309
- Not on my loveseat.
- Oh, God, no, of course not.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.526
Okay, all right, yeah.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.786
That means a part of you
does still love me,

04:37.921 --> 04:41.003
because... because you know how
much this piece means to me.

04:41.074 --> 04:42.712
Because you remember how I fell for it

04:42.749 --> 04:44.510
on our vacation, remember, in Maine.

04:44.547 --> 04:46.547
And I had it shipped back
to our apartment

04:46.584 --> 04:48.698
even though it was, like,
ridiculously expensive.

04:48.735 --> 04:50.718
And then, I dragged it with us
through six apartments

04:50.755 --> 04:52.605
in four different cities
because wherever you

04:52.642 --> 04:54.060
and this piece of furniture were,

04:54.097 --> 04:55.820
that was home. Our home.

04:55.983 --> 04:58.197
We didn't have sex on it
because that thing

04:58.234 --> 05:01.553
is made out of sharp angles
and sandpaper.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.016
I've always hated it.

05:06.442 --> 05:08.428
Terrible news. Just... just terrible.

05:08.465 --> 05:10.190
Come on in.

05:11.821 --> 05:13.630
Is that a loveseat?

05:16.350 --> 05:17.533
Uh, hope you don't mind,

05:17.570 --> 05:20.110
I was feeding Clemenza when you called.

05:20.411 --> 05:22.933
Oh, he's my turtle.
He came with the place.

05:23.010 --> 05:24.459
He's 100 years old.

05:24.512 --> 05:27.126
Oh, that would explain the weird smell.

05:27.306 --> 05:29.467
What smell? Hey, buddy.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.366
Hey, were your hidden
inner ears burning there?

05:32.403 --> 05:33.967
Say hi, Clemenza. Say hi.

05:34.006 --> 05:36.544
Mm, no, if that thing
comes near me, I'ma kick it.

05:36.671 --> 05:38.380
♪ I'm chopping up some cabbage ♪

05:38.417 --> 05:39.705
♪ For Clemenza ♪

05:49.835 --> 05:50.975
Here we go.

05:51.012 --> 05:53.130
Oh, wow, he does stink. You're right.

05:53.187 --> 05:57.121
Well, basically a 100-year-old
ballsack inside of that shell.

05:57.158 --> 06:00.938
- I mean, can you blame him?
- This is a nightmare.

06:08.815 --> 06:11.342
- Morning.
- It's 3:00 p.m.

06:11.379 --> 06:13.762
But hey, time is a construct, isn't it?

06:13.858 --> 06:16.635
- Breakfast for you?
- Just coffee.

06:16.989 --> 06:18.997
Well then, you are in luck,

06:19.074 --> 06:20.545
because Charles sent me a bag

06:20.582 --> 06:22.751
of the best coffee in the world.

06:23.089 --> 06:27.593
These beans are dug out of the
poop of the Asian Palm Civet.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.465
That's a... a catlike creature

06:29.502 --> 06:31.933
that inhabits the jungles of Sumatra.

06:32.763 --> 06:35.072
I'm going to interpret
your seeming lack of interest

06:35.109 --> 06:37.306
as depression
and I'm going to continue here.

06:37.343 --> 06:39.291
No, these literal magic beans

06:39.328 --> 06:41.104
have their acidity removed from them

06:41.387 --> 06:44.025
through the wonders
of intestinal biology.

06:44.109 --> 06:46.350
At $200 a bag,

06:46.427 --> 06:48.953
they're a totem for the wanton opulence

06:48.990 --> 06:50.947
that defines late stage capitalism.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.343
But you know, I...

06:52.380 --> 06:54.745
I got it for free, so what do I care?

06:57.126 --> 06:59.829
Oh, boy, oh.

06:59.991 --> 07:01.991
Uh, you want to talk about it?

07:02.028 --> 07:03.853
No, you wouldn't understand.

07:03.893 --> 07:06.369
Now, okay.

07:06.504 --> 07:09.216
I realize that what I'm about
to say should never be said

07:09.253 --> 07:11.650
by an old white man to
a young gay woman of color,

07:11.687 --> 07:15.454
but I understand exactly
what you're going through.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.932
Well, come on,
every broadcaster in the world

07:17.969 --> 07:19.728
who's ever called a baseball game

07:19.765 --> 07:21.667
after walking in on
their wives cheating on them

07:21.704 --> 07:25.288
is sitting right here on this
very uncomfortable loveseat.

07:28.293 --> 07:30.227
Any-whoodles, I'm here for you.

07:30.379 --> 07:31.729
Please use me as a resource.

07:31.766 --> 07:33.653
Just... just ask me anything.

07:35.309 --> 07:37.701
Is the cat shit coffee ready?

07:38.112 --> 07:40.024
One cup of cat shit, coming right up.

07:41.164 --> 07:43.590
Look after Clemenza for me.

07:43.778 --> 07:45.344
Bye, Jim.

07:54.662 --> 07:56.304
God damn.

07:57.385 --> 07:58.543
Jesus.

07:58.703 --> 08:00.982
Just, like, so much stool softener.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.034
Yeah, you offer no comfort.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.775
You got this.

08:05.855 --> 08:07.241
Okay.

08:07.592 --> 08:08.832
All right.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.468
Nope.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.623
<i>The tortoises of the Galápagos</i>

08:32.700 --> 08:35.842
<i>live on seven of the islands.
The islands...</i>

08:40.548 --> 08:41.909
Hey.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.843
Um, how was your day?

08:46.302 --> 08:50.244
Hm, I watched a bird
commit suicide, so better.

08:50.393 --> 08:53.517
God, this thing's even more
uncomfortable than it looks.

08:53.981 --> 08:55.769
It's actually...
it's pitching me forward

08:55.806 --> 08:57.573
as if it doesn't want to be sat on.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.467
How can something be too small
to fit two people comfortably,

09:00.486 --> 09:02.375
but too large to fit into any space?

09:02.412 --> 09:03.661
- Shut up.
- I hope that you...

09:03.745 --> 09:05.169
Can you please just stop talking?

09:05.206 --> 09:07.565
Every time you open your mouth,
you make things worse.

09:07.686 --> 09:10.721
Sorry, sorry, just...
I want to be here for you.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.382
Okay, then just, like,

09:12.550 --> 09:14.108
be quiet and just watch the movie.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.087
Great, okay. What are we watching?

09:17.252 --> 09:18.335
"Dunkirk."

09:18.391 --> 09:20.667
Oh, the Christopher Nolan movie?

09:21.285 --> 09:24.174
No, I haven't seen this one.
I'm... I'm excited.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.699
It's pretty good. I mean, I don't know.

09:26.736 --> 09:28.349
All those British dudes
just look alike,

09:28.386 --> 09:29.644
so it's kind of confusing.

09:29.728 --> 09:31.301
And there's like
three separate timelines...

09:31.338 --> 09:32.723
Oh, why does every goddamn story

09:32.760 --> 09:35.335
have to be a math problem?
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.700
This man's oeuvre is a bit
of a trigger for me,

09:37.737 --> 09:40.102
so I can't be
in this environment right now.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.839
I'm going to head out.
Can I get you anything?

09:41.875 --> 09:43.674
Something to eat?
I'll go to any restaurant

09:43.711 --> 09:45.454
that brings a smile to your face.

09:45.646 --> 09:47.581
Maybe Panda Express.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.822
Oh, honey, don't settle for that.

09:49.859 --> 09:51.958
- It's not settling.
- Panda Express?

09:51.995 --> 09:53.560
That's the definition of settling.

09:53.597 --> 09:56.356
Well, I've never had it
before, or any fast food.

09:56.415 --> 09:57.823
I've been an athlete my entire life.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.143
I've always eaten clean.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.453
I'm almost a little excited
to finally try it.

10:01.514 --> 10:03.531
<i>Where's the bloody Air Force?</i>

10:03.647 --> 10:05.800
Oh, look, okay, so now,
the timelines have merged.

10:05.837 --> 10:08.212
So it's like, the past is now
the future, but the present...

10:08.249 --> 10:09.593
Nolan, you son of a bitch!

10:09.630 --> 10:12.878
Okay, sorry, got to call
my sponsor, can't be here.

10:21.069 --> 10:23.320
Hello?

10:23.953 --> 10:26.190
Jesus.

10:26.908 --> 10:29.374
- What took you so long?
- Sorry.

10:29.519 --> 10:31.450
Like, did you get everything?

10:31.775 --> 10:34.486
Two honey walnut shrimp,
one Shanghai angus steak,

10:34.505 --> 10:35.746
one five flavor shrimp,

10:35.783 --> 10:37.449
three orders of cream cheese rangoons,

10:37.486 --> 10:39.678
seven fortune cookies, one fried rice,

10:39.715 --> 10:42.878
one steamed rice, one
Kung Pao chicken, no chicken.

10:42.955 --> 10:44.777
Zach now has Tuesdays off

10:44.814 --> 10:48.039
so he can be with his new "girlfriend,"

10:48.183 --> 10:50.341
so I had to walk Jessica
through that order,

10:50.378 --> 10:53.287
and not surprisingly, your
Kung Pao chicken, no chicken

10:53.324 --> 10:55.983
proved to be way beyond her grasp.

10:57.862 --> 11:00.262
Where's the sauce?

11:00.338 --> 11:04.174
Oh, just reach into the bag.
It probably fell to the bottom.

11:04.432 --> 11:07.277
I'm sorry, what?

11:07.774 --> 11:10.706
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is there not enough sauce?

11:10.783 --> 11:12.334
That... my fault, my fault.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.629
I was in charge of getting the sauce.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.600
Jim told me to get
more than I ever thought

11:15.640 --> 11:18.491
one person could consume,
so I then made a judgment call.

11:18.528 --> 11:19.731
Yeah, you remember Maggie?

11:19.772 --> 11:21.608
No, we had plans
to go out for some ice cream.

11:21.668 --> 11:23.075
She was kind enough
to begin our date...

11:23.112 --> 11:26.163
Shut up. I need three
squirts of sauce per bite.

11:26.243 --> 11:27.349
Per bite!

11:27.386 --> 11:30.029
Chili, Sweet Chili, Savory Sriracha.

11:30.066 --> 11:31.224
Am I taking crazy pills?

11:31.261 --> 11:33.438
Like, is this very difficult
to understand here?

11:33.501 --> 11:34.906
There is barely enough Chili.

11:34.943 --> 11:37.233
There is not even close
to enough Savory Sriracha.

11:37.309 --> 11:40.069
Okay, nope, that's it,
the end, can't eat it.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.397
Don't want it, can't have it,
thank you very much.

11:42.434 --> 11:43.540
I hope you're happy.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.358
You just starved
a woman eating for two.

11:45.395 --> 11:47.243
If I may, three.

11:47.486 --> 11:49.607
You, your baby, and your depression,

11:49.644 --> 11:51.400
which I think we can all agree
is mainly

11:51.437 --> 11:53.398
what the Panda Express is feeding here.

11:53.418 --> 11:55.696
Now, I know what a bender
looks like, darling.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.346
This is a bender you are on here.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.444
You don't move.

11:58.481 --> 12:00.164
You don't even go upstairs to sleep.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.746
You know what?
I want to see your FitBit.

12:01.783 --> 12:02.868
- No.
- Now let me see it.

12:02.905 --> 12:04.552
- No.
- Hey, FitBit,

12:04.589 --> 12:07.682
or no Panda for you. Let me just see.

12:07.824 --> 12:10.416
16 steps, my God.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.257
It's 10 steps to the bathroom,

12:12.294 --> 12:15.028
and with the way
you chug Mountain Dew...

12:16.946 --> 12:19.454
Have you been peeing
in Clemenza's litter box?

12:19.491 --> 12:22.491
- Oh, God, you're horrible!
- Oh, no!

12:22.528 --> 12:24.103
Did I pee in Clemenza's litter box?

12:24.140 --> 12:25.320
Jim, tell me something.

12:25.357 --> 12:27.072
What's on the roof
of your Christmas village?

12:28.522 --> 12:30.176
How exactly did winter come?

12:30.260 --> 12:32.408
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.889
I am sorry you're hurting,

12:33.926 --> 12:36.409
but at least you know it was real.

12:38.415 --> 12:41.229
- What are you talking about?
- You feeling this way

12:41.266 --> 12:43.313
only proves that you really loved her,

12:43.350 --> 12:45.028
and that is not nothing.

12:45.171 --> 12:47.278
I always find it sad
when a relationship ends

12:47.315 --> 12:48.631
and you feel nothing, because then

12:48.668 --> 12:50.406
it was truly a waste of time.

12:50.443 --> 12:52.049
That's obviously not the case here.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.830
You clearly really loved her.

12:56.135 --> 12:58.710
I did, and yeah, I still do.

12:59.108 --> 13:00.564
Yeah.

13:01.103 --> 13:02.769
Now get back to the Panda,

13:02.806 --> 13:05.158
and bring me those packets
you owe me, Sauce Bitch.

13:05.195 --> 13:06.290
- Okay.
- Oh, Gabby.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.678
No, no, don't you move.
Now, come on, now.

13:09.285 --> 13:13.097
Uh, excuse me, how long has
that door been left open?

13:13.318 --> 13:14.645
I don't know.

13:14.723 --> 13:16.148
Got one rule in the house, right?

13:16.185 --> 13:17.840
One. Keep the doors closed

13:17.877 --> 13:19.076
so Clemenza cannot escape...

13:19.113 --> 13:20.793
no, never going to forgive you
for this one!

13:20.830 --> 13:22.559
Ever, ever! Oh, my poor little

13:22.596 --> 13:25.674
100-year-old baby boy! Clemenza!

13:25.751 --> 13:27.137
Clemenza!

13:27.970 --> 13:29.736
He was, like, four steps away.
And there's a fence,

13:29.773 --> 13:32.440
so I might have over-reacted
to that one.

13:32.835 --> 13:35.742
Uh, this has to stop, yeah.
I'm not this person.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.226
I don't wallow, no.

13:37.263 --> 13:40.386
I set goals, I follow through,
I move forward.

13:40.423 --> 13:42.677
I need to get out of the house.
I need to go back to work.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.268
Yes, you do, because quite frankly,

13:44.344 --> 13:46.177
I'm running out of ways
to cover for you.

13:46.214 --> 13:49.365
Oh, PS, you've had shingles
for several days now.

13:49.441 --> 13:51.423
So the more you
scratch yourself at work,

13:51.460 --> 13:52.985
the better it'll be for both of us.

13:53.048 --> 13:54.198
Okay.

14:16.651 --> 14:18.689
Oh, our living room.

14:19.463 --> 14:21.047
Couch?

14:21.957 --> 14:23.399
Nope.

14:30.545 --> 14:33.016
Ooh, okay.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.762
Is everything okay?

14:36.054 --> 14:38.197
Yeah, it's just peachy, Pat.

14:38.517 --> 14:39.932
Bye.

14:40.492 --> 14:42.838
Bye, fuck you. Bye, thank you.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.419
<i>Hey, everybody, and welcome back</i>

14:48.456 --> 14:50.972
<i>to this gorgeous spring day
in Seascape, Florida,</i>

14:51.009 --> 14:53.078
<i>where we have reached
the top of the fourth here</i>

14:53.115 --> 14:54.988
<i>at King's Venom Vape Cartridge Stadium.</i>

14:55.077 --> 14:57.639
<i>King Venom Vape Cartridges:
We don't make the juice.</i>

14:57.676 --> 15:00.085
<i>We don't make the pens.
We are not liable.</i>

15:00.304 --> 15:02.154
<i>Oakland's number one pitching prospect,</i>

15:02.191 --> 15:04.273
<i>Julio Rodriguez,
still out there on the mound.</i>

15:04.350 --> 15:06.232
<i>And for those of you
keeping score at home,</i>

15:06.280 --> 15:08.488
<i>I am joined in the booth, finally,</i>

15:08.694 --> 15:10.552
my friend and colleague, Gabby Taylor.

15:10.589 --> 15:12.555
Gabby, better late than never.
How you doing today?

15:12.632 --> 15:15.380
Oh, bad, Jim. Yeah, not good at all.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.400
I am getting a divorce
after finding out

15:17.437 --> 15:19.261
that my wife has been cheating on me.

15:19.340 --> 15:22.507
Oh, and for those of you
who don't know, I'm gay.

15:25.354 --> 15:27.931
Oh, the rare coming out statement

15:27.968 --> 15:30.207
where the homosexuality
was an afterthought,

15:30.284 --> 15:31.855
as Rodriguez snaps a curve

15:31.892 --> 15:34.210
that Leonard waves
through for a strike.

15:35.888 --> 15:38.499
- 0 and 1.
- 0 and 1.

15:42.044 --> 15:43.568
For the past week,
you've been begging me

15:43.605 --> 15:45.521
to talk about my breakup,
and now that I'm ready,

15:45.558 --> 15:46.790
you don't want to hear it?

15:46.827 --> 15:48.148
I thought the only way
to call a ballgame

15:48.184 --> 15:50.188
<i>was to keep your eyes open
and tell the truth.</i>

15:50.278 --> 15:52.486
<i>Rodriguez misses with a slider wide.</i>

15:52.534 --> 15:54.841
<i>I'm just not sure this is
the appropriate forum</i>

15:54.889 --> 15:56.415
<i>to air these kinds of grievances.</i>

15:56.452 --> 15:57.681
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

15:57.718 --> 16:00.736
<i>You aired your grievances
in my exact situation,</i>

16:00.773 --> 16:02.194
and now there is an entire subsection

16:02.231 --> 16:04.156
of lesbian porn
where people dress as you.

16:04.314 --> 16:06.907
"Cuckmire" is in lesbian porn now?

16:06.944 --> 16:08.648
<i>My goodness, that thing has legs.</i>

16:08.720 --> 16:09.814
Oh, my God.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.861
No, it transcends gender and sexuality.

16:12.944 --> 16:14.905
<i>Leonard pops that one
up and out of play.</i>

16:14.942 --> 16:16.441
I'm the prime example

16:16.493 --> 16:18.633
of why you should not talk
about this stuff on the air.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.280
No, I was a broadcasting
pariah for years.

16:21.368 --> 16:22.964
What do you care if I get canned?

16:23.001 --> 16:24.816
I care about your career

16:24.853 --> 16:27.352
because you're a natural in the
booth, Gabby, I mean that.

16:27.389 --> 16:28.855
Hey, that means a lot coming from me.

16:29.217 --> 16:31.027
<i>The last time I paid
a fellow broadcaster</i>

16:31.064 --> 16:33.189
<i>a compliment, it was 1994.</i>

16:33.276 --> 16:35.276
<i>I told Dick Enberg
that he led the league</i>

16:35.313 --> 16:36.921
<i>in going bald gracefully,</i>

16:36.958 --> 16:38.758
<i>as Rodriguez misses outside again.</i>

16:38.842 --> 16:40.342
<i>Full count, 3 and 2.</i>

16:40.527 --> 16:44.011
- I gave up coaching for...
- Oh, please, use a pseudonym.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.263
- For Meredith Baxter Birney.
- Nice.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.791
I took this job for her,

16:47.828 --> 16:49.605
And what does Meredith Baxter
Birney do for me

16:49.642 --> 16:53.236
but cheat with some half-wit
wannabe Instagram photographer

16:53.273 --> 16:55.727
and leave me just
homeless and pregnant?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.684
<i>Well, I am so sorry, Gabby.</i>

16:57.721 --> 16:59.888
<i>Rodriguez misses wide off
the plate for ball four,</i>

16:59.925 --> 17:01.045
<i>and Leonard heads to first.</i>

17:01.082 --> 17:03.160
<i>Boy, Julio seems to be having trouble</i>

17:03.197 --> 17:05.098
locating his fastball today,
doesn't he?

17:05.135 --> 17:06.505
Yeah, his leg plant's too stiff.

17:06.541 --> 17:07.801
It's messing with his arm slot.

17:07.905 --> 17:09.079
<i>Looks like pitching coach.</i>

17:09.116 --> 17:11.178
<i>"Slim" Jimmy Wilcox agrees with you</i>

17:11.214 --> 17:12.640
<i>as he councils Rodriguez.</i>

17:12.676 --> 17:15.511
<i>My council to you is
to make your anger a passenger</i>

17:15.548 --> 17:16.789
<i>and not the driver, Gabby,</i>

17:16.896 --> 17:18.664
because my anger took me on a road trip

17:18.701 --> 17:21.352
through every dive and brothel
in South East Asia.

17:21.715 --> 17:23.290
The only reason my anger didn't kill me

17:23.328 --> 17:25.503
was I picked up a tapeworm in Myanmar

17:25.540 --> 17:27.950
that acted as a kind
of intestinal Brita filter.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.585
The poor thing tapped out
after six straight years

17:30.622 --> 17:33.140
of nothing snake whiskey,
Quaaludes, and chicken feet.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.185
Let me tell you something,
that is a bowel movement

17:35.222 --> 17:37.097
<i>that you do not soon forget.</i>

17:37.245 --> 17:39.070
<i>Brenly settles into the box now,</i>

17:39.107 --> 17:41.510
<i>and he is frozen by a good curveball</i>

17:41.547 --> 17:43.823
that just does hook the outside corner.

17:44.086 --> 17:47.163
Look, Gabby, as one cuck
to another, all right?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.959
No, one thing that helped ease my pain

17:50.166 --> 17:51.682
was to accept the fact

17:51.771 --> 17:54.197
that I had some culpability
in the end of my marriage.

17:54.234 --> 17:55.917
Oh, so now you're saying
you're responsible

17:55.954 --> 17:57.202
for Lucy "Lucying?"

17:57.239 --> 17:59.123
<i>Brenly takes a fastball low.</i>

17:59.160 --> 18:00.727
Count's even, 1 and 1.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.325
I am not responsible
for my wife's actions.

18:03.657 --> 18:04.756
Okay.

18:04.827 --> 18:08.354
But, um, if I'm really
going to think about it,

18:08.391 --> 18:10.983
maybe we weren't meant to be together.

18:11.187 --> 18:13.020
Maybe she was just
the only other lesbian

18:13.057 --> 18:15.167
on my dorm floor at Arizona State.

18:17.765 --> 18:20.169
<i>Julio misses outside
with a breaking ball.</i>

18:20.237 --> 18:23.122
<i>Brenly gets ahead, 2 and 1.</i>

18:23.421 --> 18:26.608
It's been painful, uh...

18:26.758 --> 18:29.322
but all I've ever done
is just play through the pain.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.542
I feel like I've been trying
to walk off this relationship

18:31.579 --> 18:33.412
for the last five years.

18:33.592 --> 18:35.743
Ah, I should have seen it.

18:36.002 --> 18:38.725
Good fastball there,
catches the outside corner.

18:38.843 --> 18:41.531
So, why didn't you?

18:42.044 --> 18:43.877
Because then, I'd have to admit

18:43.914 --> 18:46.724
that we weren't going to make it.

18:46.895 --> 18:48.925
I mean, my whole life,

18:48.962 --> 18:52.182
I've just been winning a game
that's rigged against me.

18:52.426 --> 18:53.658
I didn't think I could lose.

18:53.695 --> 18:55.620
Not at something as big as this.

18:55.724 --> 18:57.318
All right, well, allow me to offer

18:57.422 --> 18:59.276
that life is rarely as black and white

18:59.313 --> 19:00.632
as winning and losing.

19:00.669 --> 19:03.456
And even if it were, hey,
I'm looking at a winner here.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.682
You know, you're on the verge
of a very long career

19:05.719 --> 19:07.675
in both broadcasting and motherhood.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.999
I'd buy stock in your future.

19:10.072 --> 19:12.427
And in this oligarchical dystopia

19:12.464 --> 19:14.467
that we all seem to be
hurtling straight towards,

19:14.504 --> 19:16.337
<i>I might soon be able to. Who knows?</i>

19:16.374 --> 19:18.681
As Rodriguez blows that fastball

19:18.718 --> 19:21.111
right by Brenly for the strikeout.

19:23.351 --> 19:25.543
Well, I'd buy stock in Julio Rodriguez.

19:25.609 --> 19:27.351
<i>He's a little looser
with that plant leg,</i>

19:27.388 --> 19:30.538
and getting back on top of the
two and four-seam fastballs.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.053
- Very impressive.
- It sure is.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.153
It appears that we have been

19:34.190 --> 19:35.766
neglecting our sponsors, however.

19:35.785 --> 19:37.124
And in a lifetime first,

19:37.161 --> 19:39.123
I have grown tired
of the sound of my own voice.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.827
So, Gabby, what do you say?

19:41.864 --> 19:43.522
You still with me?

19:44.290 --> 19:46.853
This overly emotional conversation

19:46.890 --> 19:50.053
has been brought to you by
King Venom Vape Cartridges.

19:50.104 --> 19:52.032
You need a 510 thread?
We got you covered.

19:52.069 --> 19:53.904
An E60 thread? No problem.

19:53.941 --> 19:55.608
710? We can't help you.

19:55.645 --> 19:59.147
It's a proprietary technology
that we don't have access to.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.889
Still just amazes me

20:00.926 --> 20:03.327
that that's the largest
sponsor we can get.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.906
Do you really think
everything will be okay?

20:09.052 --> 20:11.540
In this country
and the world at large, no.

20:11.689 --> 20:13.683
Global warming and the decrease

20:13.720 --> 20:15.468
in labor demand due to automation

20:15.505 --> 20:17.326
is giving us all a big two-handed push

20:17.363 --> 20:18.492
right into the abyss.

20:18.529 --> 20:22.138
But as far as your life goes,
you'll be fine.

20:22.715 --> 20:25.040
All that stuff won't affect
you or your child

20:25.077 --> 20:29.039
for a good, like, oh, ten years or so.

20:29.330 --> 20:30.667
Can you read it again?

20:30.809 --> 20:32.768
- Again?
- Yeah.

20:32.884 --> 20:36.412
Um, "our bosses wanted
to thank the three of us"

20:36.449 --> 20:38.833
"for 'pushing the
paradigm of broadcasting"

20:38.870 --> 20:40.422
"into the 21st century.'

20:40.459 --> 20:42.020
"I don't know what that means.

20:42.057 --> 20:44.586
I'm confused and scared. Signed, Gus."

20:44.623 --> 20:45.973
He actually wrote "signed, Gus."

20:46.010 --> 20:48.528
I don't think he understands
how texting works.

20:48.659 --> 20:51.164
I cannot believe we're not fired.

20:51.201 --> 20:52.630
No, no, we just gave them

20:52.667 --> 20:54.681
a whole season's worth
of free publicity.

20:54.810 --> 20:57.501
Right now, we are
every baseball owner's dream.

20:57.538 --> 21:00.108
We are superstars on a cheap contract.

21:00.436 --> 21:03.046
Oh, what about April if she's a girl?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.632
Well, behind every
great name, there's a story.

21:05.669 --> 21:07.744
So what's April's story?

21:08.167 --> 21:10.817
She's named after the start
of the baseball season.

21:11.135 --> 21:14.517
Oh, I like April very much.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.577
Boy, I feel like I'm just nailing

21:16.614 --> 21:18.122
this whole "good friend" thing.

21:18.159 --> 21:19.733
What else can I do for you?

21:19.869 --> 21:22.472
Just, like, not talk for a while.

21:24.198 --> 21:26.107
That's going to be really hard for me.

21:26.336 --> 21:28.066
I know.

21:34.272 --> 21:35.838
Aw.
