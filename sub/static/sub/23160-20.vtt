WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:01.934
This your first case?
Yes.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.263
To yesterday.

00:06.273 --> 00:09.299
<i>I'm one of the top
ranking women surfers in the world.</i>

00:09.376 --> 00:11.867
<i>All I wanna do is surf and win.</i>

00:13.113 --> 00:16.047
You stay away from Karen Teel or
you <i>'</i> re history. You got that?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.908
She quit the competition.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.675
I will, for you.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.682
You see, the one trick in staying
alive in this crazy, cock-eyed world...

00:23.757 --> 00:24.883
is to know when you <i>'</i> re licked.

02:05.157 --> 02:06.419
<i>It's kind of funny...</i>

02:06.492 --> 02:08.619
<i>how the years can sometimes
creep by on you...</i>

02:08.693 --> 02:11.754
<i>two or three at a time
and nothing much changes.</i>

02:11.831 --> 02:15.562
<i>You're in a routine and all that
you really get is a little older...</i>

02:16.002 --> 02:17.367
<i>until whammo!</i>

02:17.436 --> 02:21.770
<i>You get a big 365 that sometimes
sets you right on your ear.</i>

02:21.841 --> 02:23.240
<i>Changes everything.</i>

02:23.976 --> 02:26.809
<i>I guess 1979 was that kind
of year for me.</i>

02:27.713 --> 02:30.739
<i>I resigned from the Navy and I
became a private investigator.</i>

02:30.816 --> 02:32.875
<i>Of course, that's
a big over-simplification.</i>

02:33.319 --> 02:36.254
<i>Actually, there was
a little more to it than that.</i>

02:36.355 --> 02:38.585
<i>There was Karen Teel,
for example.</i>

02:38.991 --> 02:41.824
<i>The best woman surfer of 1979.</i>

02:42.228 --> 02:45.857
<i>And 1978, and 1977, and 1976.</i>

02:58.811 --> 03:01.405
<i>Karen was the best.</i>

03:01.480 --> 03:04.574
<i>She always won, no matter
who she went up against.</i>

03:04.650 --> 03:08.746
<i>And I really think it was that
way because her love for life...</i>

03:08.821 --> 03:10.948
<i>brought out the best in her.</i>

03:22.268 --> 03:24.236
<i>I know that,
because a long time ago...</i>

03:24.303 --> 03:26.396
<i>Karen Teel brought out
the best in me.</i>

03:28.674 --> 03:30.539
<i>It seemed like only yesterday.</i>

03:35.348 --> 03:36.406
Who <i>'</i> s there?

03:36.482 --> 03:38.040
Magnum. Magnum who?

03:39.952 --> 03:41.317
I say, Magnum...

03:42.054 --> 03:45.114
I wonder if you would be
so kind as to finally...

03:45.191 --> 03:47.557
if not graciously, return the...

03:50.663 --> 03:52.722
Are you going on a journey,
Magnum?

03:52.798 --> 03:54.925
Yes.
I see.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.537
Perhaps, a lengthy one?

03:59.438 --> 04:00.735
Perhaps.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.371
Judging a beauty contest,
no doubt.

04:03.442 --> 04:06.707
Cheap, gold-plated women
with a trophy of similar ilk.

04:06.812 --> 04:08.279
Bon voyage.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.578
How long?
I don <i>'</i> t know.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.012
Magnum,
where are you really going?

04:17.890 --> 04:20.415
Probably to Doc Ibold.
I think I need stitches.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.620
I doubt it.
It hurts.

04:22.695 --> 04:26.722
Your extremely limited capacity
for pain never ceases to amaze me...

04:27.033 --> 04:31.129
as does the fact that you actually
survived three tours of duty in Vietnam.

04:31.203 --> 04:33.228
Now, I insist you tell me
what you <i>'</i> re up to.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.829
I am up to a case.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.568
How long? Where? For whom?

04:36.642 --> 04:38.906
Higgins, what did you want me
to return?

04:38.978 --> 04:40.673
Because I <i>'</i> m just about to leave.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.008
Never mind that. I <i>'</i> ll find it.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.208
Right now, we <i>'</i> re discussing
your cavalier abrogation...

04:44.283 --> 04:46.012
of your duties here
on this estate.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.848
Now, I demand to know
where you <i>'</i> re going.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.445
I will call you every night,
I promise.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.053
Magnum, wait.

04:52.124 --> 04:53.148
What?

04:53.225 --> 04:55.921
You <i>'</i> re not taking the Ferrari.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.087
I don <i>'</i> t need it.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.393
But - I <i>'</i> ve got the Jimmy.
Robin said it <i>'</i> s all right.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.626
Magnum, I demand to know
where you <i>'</i> re going.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.332
Out of your life.

05:14.246 --> 05:16.271
<i>Thomas Wolfe
once wrote a book called...</i>

05:16.348 --> 05:17.872
You Can <i>'</i> t Go Home Again.

05:17.950 --> 05:21.545
<i>It was partly about a guy's
inability to recapture the past.</i>

05:21.887 --> 05:24.583
<i>No matter how hard he tried,
things had changed.</i>

05:24.924 --> 05:26.516
<i>People changed.</i>

05:26.826 --> 05:29.056
<i>All of which brought me
to the question of why...</i>

05:29.128 --> 05:32.928
<i>I was driving out to the
North Shore to see Karen Teel.</i>

05:32.998 --> 05:35.125
<i>Perhaps, I was trying
to go home again.</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.226
This your first case?

05:38.037 --> 05:40.369
Oh, no. Not exactly.

05:40.439 --> 05:44.933
I mean, I had a very tough insurance
adjustment claim just the other week and...

05:45.010 --> 05:47.570
I mean, there were three cars
and a pineapple truck and...

05:47.913 --> 05:51.747
Yes, if you hire me,
this is my first case.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.312
So, how did you find me,
Miss Teel?

05:55.588 --> 05:57.818
Oh, it <i>'</i> s Karen, please.
Karen.

05:58.224 --> 06:02.126
Actually, I picked this up
at The Curl at Haleiwa.

06:02.595 --> 06:05.257
It
Worked? The matchbook worked.

06:05.464 --> 06:08.627
Listen, any private investigator
that advertises on a matchbox...

06:08.701 --> 06:09.963
is worth a shot.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.165
I also asked Jack
the bartender about you.

06:15.241 --> 06:19.075
He said that you <i>'</i> d been in naval intelligence
and that you knew what you were doing.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.407
Now, that <i>'</i> s what
I really need...

06:20.479 --> 06:22.947
is someone who knows
what the hell they <i>'</i> re doing.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.573
What <i>'</i> s the problem?

06:25.818 --> 06:30.050
See, I need someone right now who
can keep me in one piece for 10 days.

06:32.424 --> 06:36.861
See, I <i>'</i> m entered in the 1979
North Shore Surf-out in Haleiwa.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.423
I <i>'</i> m good, and I <i>'</i> m a favorite.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.935
As a matter of fact, I <i>'</i> m one of the
top ranking women surfers in the world.

06:45.504 --> 06:47.631
I don <i>'</i> t know much
about professional surfing.

06:47.706 --> 06:50.197
But you do know a little bit
about guerilla warfare.

06:51.977 --> 06:53.239
Jack told me.

06:55.948 --> 06:59.611
See, the problem is that
there <i>'</i> s this bunch of guys...

07:00.019 --> 07:03.455
a syndicate, I guess, who represent
a couple of other women surfers.

07:03.522 --> 07:06.082
Good ones,
but maybe not as good as me.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.617
And they <i>'</i> ve invested
all this money in them...

07:08.694 --> 07:12.095
so that if they win, they get
endorsements, surfboard manufacturers...

07:12.164 --> 07:16.100
clothing, soft drink commercials,
things like that. You know, big bucks.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.098
It <i>'</i> s a lot of bucks.

07:19.738 --> 07:24.004
I guess what I <i>'</i> m trying to say is
that they don <i>'</i> t want me to compete.

07:24.543 --> 07:26.272
And for sure,
they don <i>'</i> t want me to win.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.074
Then, you <i>'</i> d get
all the endorsements.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.945
Yeah, but I don <i>'</i> t need that.
I don <i>'</i> t even have a sponsor.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.318
All I want to do is surf.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.080
And win?

07:36.655 --> 07:37.883
And win.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.758
So, what do you say?

07:42.995 --> 07:44.929
It sounds like
you need a bodyguard.

07:45.497 --> 07:49.558
Yeah, I guess I do. But I also want
to find out who the muscle guy is.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.103
It would make
a lot of people happy.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.062
Sea <i>'</i> s becoming very rough
out there.

07:54.139 --> 07:57.666
So rough that I would wanna
hire a matchbook Pl.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.443
What <i>'</i> s wrong?
Did I say something wrong?

08:03.682 --> 08:06.242
I don <i>'</i> t know.
It just didn <i>'</i> t sound too good.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.520
I would prefer <i>
</i>"private investigator.<i>"</i>

08:09.788 --> 08:13.121
Well, I guess I <i>'</i> ve hired
myself a private investigator.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.630
<i>A professional baseball
player always remembers...</i>

08:20.699 --> 08:22.690
<i>his first major league base hit.</i>

08:22.768 --> 08:26.704
<i>A violinist, the first time he steps
out on the boards at Carnegie Hall...</i>

08:26.772 --> 08:29.639
<i>and a surgeon the first time he
takes out tonsils by himself.</i>

08:30.509 --> 08:33.068
<i>And, of course, I remember...</i>

08:33.145 --> 08:36.842
<i>my first gainful employment
as a private investigator.</i>

08:37.316 --> 08:40.409
<i>The only thing for sure about
it was the free room and board.</i>

08:41.320 --> 08:43.754
Here it is. All
the comforts of home, right?

08:44.990 --> 08:47.015
Better. I <i>'</i> ve
been sleeping in my office.

08:47.092 --> 08:48.650
Just ask Felix.

08:48.727 --> 08:49.955
Yeah, I did.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.121
Boy, that <i>'</i> s a shame.

08:51.196 --> 08:52.185
Hmm.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.064
Oh, yeah.

08:54.366 --> 08:55.765
The supermarket?

08:55.834 --> 08:57.426
Mmm-mmm. Kam Highway.

08:58.003 --> 09:01.461
Some jokers in a Camaro last night
tried to run me off the highway.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.331
That <i>'</i> s why you <i>'</i> re here.

09:04.276 --> 09:06.608
You got a license number?
Partial.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.710
But I have a good memory.

09:09.114 --> 09:11.582
Come on, let <i>'</i> s get you set up.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.086
Kind of drafty in here, but
the nights are warm and balmy...

09:24.163 --> 09:26.256
so you shouldn <i>'</i> t
have any problem.

09:27.499 --> 09:30.798
<i>Karen was right about
the nights being warm and balmy.</i>

09:30.869 --> 09:33.702
<i>After that, things got
much more complicated.</i>

09:34.506 --> 09:38.636
<i>And now, five years later,
the only thing for sure that was still the same...</i>

09:39.078 --> 09:41.205
<i>was the free room and board.</i>

09:48.620 --> 09:50.178
Hi. Hi.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.448
How are you?

09:52.891 --> 09:54.017
Fine.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.319
Good.

10:00.966 --> 10:03.298
You look good.
So do you.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.859
Well, thanks.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.808
I <i>'</i> ve got dinner going inside.
I still make a great ratatouille.

10:12.678 --> 10:13.940
Great.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.348
Come on in and meet Sandy.
She <i>'</i> s dying to meet you.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.713
How old is she?
Four-and-a-half.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.853
She <i>'</i> s a Pisces. Come on.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.582
What happened to your
thumb? Industrial accident.

10:31.463 --> 10:32.896
Here he is.

10:33.432 --> 10:34.990
Uncle Thomas.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.734
Hi, Sandy. How <i>'</i> re you doing?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.234
Hi.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.041
She never acts like this.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.645
Guess it <i>'</i> s just the effect
you have on all the Teel women.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.181
And this is my friend, Leah.
Leah, this is Thomas Magnum.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.547
Hi.
Hello.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.754
I <i>'</i> m sorry, but from
what Karen had said...

10:56.822 --> 10:58.687
I thought you would be
about seven-feet tall...

10:58.757 --> 11:01.021
and come riding up here
in a big, white horse.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.062
Well, I think maybe I shrunk,
but my horse is outside.

11:04.129 --> 11:06.222
Really? A horse?

11:08.067 --> 11:11.036
No, sweetheart.
Uncle Thomas was only kidding.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.501
Come on.

11:13.138 --> 11:15.038
He does things like that.

11:16.141 --> 11:17.267
There.

11:17.709 --> 11:21.611
Leah is a protégée of mine. She <i>'</i> s
going to be the next Karen Teel.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.246
Next year.
Maybe two.

11:24.783 --> 11:26.011
Thanks.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.943
Come on, let <i>'</i> s get you set up
in the trailer.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.113
Okay.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.157
Sandy, say goodbye
to Uncle Thomas.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.754
Bye.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.184
Bye.

11:43.268 --> 11:45.429
She <i>'</i> s very pretty.
Who, Leah?

11:45.737 --> 11:48.467
Well, her, too, but I was
talking about my niece.

11:48.774 --> 11:52.266
She looks more like her father
than me, I think. Good old Walt.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.913
Thanks for staying.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.642
Well, you <i>'</i> re paying me
good money.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.910
That <i>'</i> s right.

11:58.984 --> 11:59.973
Twenty percent...

12:00.052 --> 12:02.111
and free room and board.
Free room and board.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.850
So, do you believe in déjà vu?

12:07.926 --> 12:09.325
Oh, I don <i>'</i> t know.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.891
Think Walt <i>'</i> s on the island yet?

12:12.431 --> 12:14.558
I don <i>'</i> t know.
That <i>'</i> s what I <i>'</i> m afraid of.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.726
A friend of mine
saw him in Sydney.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.227
Said that he was on his way.

12:20.672 --> 12:22.936
Says he <i>'</i> ll try and get Sandy
anyway he can.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.602
Well, I <i>'</i> ll find him.
That <i>'</i> s what I <i>'</i> m here for.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.938
Yeah.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.411
So, how <i>'</i> s the comeback going?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.244
I <i>'</i> m in the best shape of my
life. Doesn <i>'</i> t it look like it?

12:31.316 --> 12:33.443
I mean, considering my age,
of course.

12:34.286 --> 12:38.222
No. Two more weeks of training though
and I <i>'</i> m going to win this thing.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.425
Well, I hope so,
for the sake of my salary.

12:42.427 --> 12:44.554
No, listen, you <i>'</i> ve been away
from this for a long time.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.030
I think it <i>'</i> d be great if
you just made it to the finals.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.228
Same old Thomas Magnum,
less is more.

12:51.503 --> 12:54.028
Mommy! Help!
Karen! Karen!

13:03.448 --> 13:05.075
You all right?
Oh, no!

13:25.709 --> 13:27.643
So you think those guys
were friends of Walt <i>'</i> s.

13:28.789 --> 13:30.086
I guess.

13:30.825 --> 13:32.816
Surf bums, just like him.

13:34.929 --> 13:37.295
I could <i>'</i> ve chosen
a little better, I guess.

13:37.431 --> 13:40.059
But I was on the rebound,
as you recall.

13:42.203 --> 13:43.431
Sorry.

13:46.507 --> 13:49.738
See, Walt left me three months
before I had Sandy.

13:50.211 --> 13:51.678
Said he couldn <i>'</i> t handle it.

13:52.146 --> 13:54.376
The only thing that jerk
could handle was big waves.

13:54.448 --> 13:56.746
Baja, Australia, South Africa.

13:57.785 --> 13:59.753
Me, I had Sandy.

14:00.654 --> 14:02.315
I kind of retired.

14:05.059 --> 14:08.085
Except for <i>'</i> 81 when I
didn <i>'</i> t even make it to the semis.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.528
Remember?
Yeah, I saw it in the papers.

14:11.799 --> 14:14.199
I called.
I know.

14:14.268 --> 14:16.736
Sorry, I didn <i>'</i> t get back
to you for three years.

14:19.306 --> 14:22.571
Anyway, now he <i>'</i> s decided
he wants his kid.

14:23.310 --> 14:27.246
He says that he <i>'</i> s ready for fatherhood,
that he <i>'</i> s got his act together.

14:27.615 --> 14:29.674
I mean, it <i>'</i> s like he
threatens me from another continent.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.742
Says that I <i>'</i> m not a good
enough mother for his little girl.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.219
He <i>'</i> s not even seen her.

14:36.123 --> 14:37.886
But I have a restraining order.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.285
And you.

14:43.931 --> 14:47.298
You know, Karen, Walt is not going to
go away when this meet <i>'</i> s over.

14:47.368 --> 14:48.630
What are you gonna do then?

14:49.236 --> 14:50.931
I don <i>'</i> t know, Thomas.

14:51.705 --> 14:53.866
I don <i>'</i> t know. This is my home.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.681
You <i>'</i> re not permanent
protection, are you?

15:12.293 --> 15:14.056
I didn <i>'</i> t think so.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.793
You <i>'</i> re a professional.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.961
I <i>'</i> ll just have to
be professional, too.

15:25.539 --> 15:26.665
Okay?

15:27.107 --> 15:28.404
Okay.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.648
Look, I wanna
rundown these guys.

15:39.987 --> 15:42.251
I think they <i>'</i> ve got
a head start on you.

15:44.391 --> 15:45.722
Good luck.

15:48.329 --> 15:49.887
It <i>'</i> s going to be tough.

15:52.666 --> 15:55.601
<i>It's going
to be worse than tough, sweetheart.</i>

16:00.541 --> 16:02.099
It <i>'</i> s impossible.

16:03.110 --> 16:06.375
You see, the one trick in staying
alive in this crazy, cock-eyed world...

16:06.447 --> 16:07.607
is to know when you <i>'</i> re licked.

16:07.681 --> 16:08.705
Rick.

16:08.782 --> 16:10.181
Is to know when
to pick your marbles up-

16:10.250 --> 16:12.912
Will you cut it out? You sound
like the marbles are in your mouth.

16:12.987 --> 16:14.955
All I <i>'</i> m asking for
is a little favor.

16:15.022 --> 16:17.490
Everybody wants a favor,
sweetheart.

16:17.791 --> 16:20.419
You see, I <i>'</i> m just a Joe
who manages a gin joint.

16:20.527 --> 16:23.121
Who drives all the way to
the North Shore after work...

16:23.197 --> 16:25.927
because my buddy tells me
that he needs my help.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.460
When I get here, I find out
that all he wants me to do is...

16:29.970 --> 16:31.198
is, is...

16:31.505 --> 16:33.370
is run down
a license plate number!

16:33.440 --> 16:36.671
Thomas, what do you think I am,
the DMV or something? I've never done this before!

16:36.744 --> 16:38.905
What could be so hard?
You got connections.

16:38.979 --> 16:41.880
Three letters and one number?
It <i>'</i> s not even complete!

16:41.949 --> 16:43.143
Yes, but that <i>'</i> s a good start.

16:43.217 --> 16:45.708
I mean, in the combinations of
the last two numbers could be...

16:45.786 --> 16:47.583
Hundreds of cars.
Dozens.

16:47.655 --> 16:50.681
What <i>'</i> s the difference? How am I supposed
to know which one <i>'</i> s the right one?

16:50.758 --> 16:53.318
Well, you know, Rick, how you <i>'</i> re
always saying you know people.

16:53.394 --> 16:55.259
So what?
Everybody knows somebody.

16:55.329 --> 16:59.265
I mean, know people. Like that guy, Ice
Cube, you <i>'</i> re always talking about.

17:00.634 --> 17:03.899
That <i>'</i> s Ice Pick.
Whatever. Doesn <i>'</i> t matter.

17:03.971 --> 17:06.940
Listen, Rick, I think
it <i>'</i> s okay to have idols.

17:07.007 --> 17:09.202
I mean, I grew up wanting
to hit like Hank Greenberg.

17:09.276 --> 17:12.143
So, there <i>'</i> s no reason you shouldn <i>'</i> t
want to grow up to be Humphrey Bogart.

17:12.212 --> 17:15.943
But I think you should know that unless
you want the entire city of Honolulu...

17:16.016 --> 17:18.848
to know your real name,
you are going to-

17:18.919 --> 17:21.717
What did you say
that number was, sweetheart?

17:24.992 --> 17:27.050
<i>I guess that
was the first time...</i>

17:27.127 --> 17:29.687
<i>I ever asked Rick
to run down a plate.</i>

17:29.897 --> 17:32.195
<i>And, of course, it wasn't
going to be the last.</i>

17:33.000 --> 17:37.266
<i>But even though Rick almost always came
through, I knew I couldn't wait for him.</i>

17:37.337 --> 17:39.396
<i>So I left Karen and Sandy
at Chun's Reef...</i>

17:39.473 --> 17:41.998
<i>where she usually practiced
with Leah and her friends.</i>

17:42.076 --> 17:43.703
<i>Hopefully, safety in numbers.</i>

17:43.777 --> 17:47.770
<i>Meanwhile, I thought I'd cruise the North
shore for the guys in that dune buggy.</i>

17:51.618 --> 17:53.210
<i>But then I was
suddenly reminded...</i>

17:53.287 --> 17:56.381
<i>there was more to that buggy
than just a license plate.</i>

18:01.995 --> 18:04.896
Hey, I want to talk to you
about that surfboard.

19:05.092 --> 19:06.150
Where <i>'</i> s Walt?

19:06.226 --> 19:08.990
I don <i>'</i> t know what you <i>'</i> re talking
about, man. I don <i>'</i> t know any Walt.

19:09.062 --> 19:11.394
Walt. I <i>'</i> m telling
you, you got the wrong guy.

19:11.465 --> 19:12.762
I got the right board.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.198
Are you crazy?
That ain <i>'</i> t my board.

19:14.268 --> 19:17.704
The hell it isn <i>'</i> t. I saw it sticking
out of the back of your dune buggy...

19:21.875 --> 19:24.469
Why <i>'</i> d you run?
Because it <i>'</i> s not my board.

19:24.978 --> 19:26.912
I found it up on the beach
at Pipeline.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.210
Hey, if you want it so bad,
you can keep it.

19:33.787 --> 19:36.153
Hey, look, I <i>'</i> m sorry.
Forget it.

19:36.657 --> 19:38.682
How many other guys you <i>'</i> re
gonna push around today?

19:41.829 --> 19:45.265
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>'</i>, Good lovin <i>' *</i>

19:46.433 --> 19:48.128
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>' *</i>

19:51.271 --> 19:55.264
<i>*</i> I was feeling so bad <i>*</i>

19:56.510 --> 20:00.105
<i>*</i> I asked my family doctor
just what I had <i>*</i>

20:01.014 --> 20:05.951
<i>*</i> I said, Doctor,
Mr. MD, Doctor <i>*</i>

20:07.120 --> 20:09.748
<i>*</i> Tell me, what <i>'</i> s ailing me <i>*</i>

20:10.757 --> 20:13.885
<i>*</i> He said, <i>"</i> Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah <i>" *</i>

20:13.961 --> 20:16.293
<i>*</i> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <i>*</i>

20:18.232 --> 20:20.723
<i>*</i> What I really need <i>*</i>

20:20.901 --> 20:22.459
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>' *</i>

20:23.070 --> 20:24.503
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>' *</i>

20:25.772 --> 20:27.171
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>' *</i>

20:28.242 --> 20:29.573
<i>*</i> Good lovin <i>' **</i>

20:59.139 --> 21:01.573
Why don <i>'</i> t we go some...

21:02.009 --> 21:04.000
Some place
where there <i>'</i> s more room?

21:04.077 --> 21:05.635
No, this is fine.

21:07.247 --> 21:09.306
Yeah, if you like being
an acrobat.

21:11.051 --> 21:12.382
Come on.

21:13.253 --> 21:14.618
Come on.

21:14.888 --> 21:16.287
Come on.

21:18.592 --> 21:20.025
What <i>'</i> s the matter?

21:20.093 --> 21:22.891
Nothing.
Why, certainly not you.

21:24.331 --> 21:26.765
Oh, it <i>'</i> s me. I just...

21:27.801 --> 21:30.770
I <i>'</i> m having a hard time
remembering I <i>'</i> m working for you.

21:32.306 --> 21:35.036
I don <i>'</i> t know. Maybe we ought
to slow down just a little bit.

21:38.211 --> 21:40.441
I <i>'</i> m just being
real unprofessional.

21:42.883 --> 21:46.649
Well, I think it <i>'</i> s okay if you just don <i>'</i> t
make it a habit with all your clients.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.688
Yeah, but
you <i>'</i> re the only one I got.

22:02.135 --> 22:04.695
Besides when it <i>'</i> s right,
it <i>'</i> s right.

22:06.573 --> 22:09.269
See, I don <i>'</i> t think you
can lay abstract words like...

22:09.476 --> 22:12.639
<i>"</i> ethics <i>"</i> and <i>"</i> ideals <i>"</i>
on your feelings.

22:19.419 --> 22:21.887
Sometimes,
they just don <i>'</i> t apply.

22:23.390 --> 22:24.948
Like now.

22:34.835 --> 22:37.827
<i>By this time,
Goldilocks was real hungry, so...</i>

22:37.904 --> 22:40.737
<i>she tries the first bowl
of porridge and it's too hot.</i>

22:40.807 --> 22:43.708
Then she tries the second bowl of
porridge and it <i>'</i> s too cold.

22:43.777 --> 22:46.473
Get to the
bears. Okay. Real soon.

22:46.546 --> 22:49.071
But see, right now,
from all this eating...

22:49.149 --> 22:51.481
Goldilocks is real tired.

22:51.551 --> 22:54.213
So, she goes upstairs
to take a nap.

22:54.354 --> 22:56.015
And there <i>'</i> s three beds there.

22:56.123 --> 22:59.650
And she tries the first bed
and it <i>'</i> s too hard.

22:59.793 --> 23:04.753
I know. Too hard,
too soft, and just right.

23:04.931 --> 23:07.525
And you forgot about the chairs.

23:09.269 --> 23:13.706
Right. But see, now,
here come the bears.

23:14.674 --> 23:19.577
See, they troop into the
kitchen to eat their porridge...

23:20.080 --> 23:22.844
and the papa bear looks
at his porridge and he says...

23:22.949 --> 23:25.713
"Someon <i>e</i>'s been eating
my porridge.<i>"</i>

23:25.786 --> 23:29.085
The mama bear looks at her
porridge and she says...

23:29.156 --> 23:31.181
"Someon <i>e</i>'s been eating
my porridge.<i>"</i>

23:31.258 --> 23:34.022
And the baby bear, he looks
at his porridge and he says...

23:34.094 --> 23:37.325
"Someon <i>e</i>'s been eating my
porridge and they ate it all up.<i>"</i>

23:37.497 --> 23:42.366
Well, they didn <i>'</i> t know what to do,
so they decided to go upstairs and catch some z <i>'</i> s.

23:43.270 --> 23:46.671
So, the papa bear goes up and he
looks at his bed and he says...

23:46.773 --> 23:49.367
"Someon <i>e</i>'s been sleeping
in my bed.<i>"</i>

23:49.843 --> 23:53.677
The mama bear says, "Someon <i>e</i>'s
been sleeping in my bed.<i>"</i>

23:54.314 --> 23:58.273
And the baby bear says, <i>"</i> Someone <i>'</i> s
been sleeping in my bed...

23:58.485 --> 24:00.214
"and here she is.<i>"</i>

24:00.454 --> 24:03.981
So, Goldilocks, she wakes up
and she is so scared...

24:04.257 --> 24:07.055
that she jumps out the window...

24:07.127 --> 24:11.860
and she lands on a trampoline and
shoots her way up to the moon and...

24:13.366 --> 24:16.494
she meets this guy
who <i>'</i> s made of green cheese...

24:47.934 --> 24:49.561
To yesterday.

25:20.032 --> 25:21.294
Hello?

25:22.134 --> 25:24.967
Yeah, he <i>'</i> s here.
Yeah, just a minute.

25:25.637 --> 25:26.934
It <i>'</i> s for you.

25:34.279 --> 25:37.612
Some guy with a speech impediment.
He keeps calling me "Shweetheart.<i>"</i>

25:40.018 --> 25:41.542
Yeah, Rick?

25:42.020 --> 25:43.544
Oh, yeah.

25:43.989 --> 25:45.115
Karen?

25:46.491 --> 25:49.051
Yeah? Okay.

25:51.263 --> 25:54.096
All right. Thanks, Rick.
I owe you one.

25:54.733 --> 25:56.894
Okay, I owe you two. Thanks.

25:57.569 --> 25:58.729
Listen.

25:58.804 --> 26:01.739
I found out about that Camaro
that tried to run you off the road.

26:01.807 --> 26:03.832
It <i>'</i> s registered
to a guy named Joe Soames.

26:03.909 --> 26:06.343
Well, that fits.
He <i>'</i> s a surfing promoter.

26:06.411 --> 26:09.437
He has a ranch on the other
side of the Island near Kaneohe.

26:10.282 --> 26:12.910
They say that he promotes more
than just homegrown surfers.

26:12.984 --> 26:15.077
More like
homegrown-homegrown.

26:16.588 --> 26:17.850
Be careful.

26:22.728 --> 26:25.720
Karen, about-
Please.

26:25.931 --> 26:28.559
You <i>'</i> re not going to say
about last night, were you?

26:31.169 --> 26:32.500
Think I was.

26:34.906 --> 26:36.305
Well, what about it?

26:38.977 --> 26:40.274
I just...

26:45.250 --> 26:48.686
I wasn <i>'</i> t being totally honest
with you last night. I wasn <i>'</i> t...

26:49.354 --> 26:51.686
really talking
about professional ethics.

26:52.457 --> 26:56.518
Well, I was, but there <i>'</i> s
more to it than that.

26:57.996 --> 27:00.487
I guess you <i>'</i> ve got a girl.
I should <i>'</i> ve known.

27:03.001 --> 27:05.231
It <i>'</i> s just that it felt so right.

27:06.338 --> 27:09.034
I don <i>'</i> t know. Maybe it is.

27:11.643 --> 27:13.907
I was married, Karen.
In Vietnam.

27:14.412 --> 27:17.711
And my wife died the day we
evacuated. She was killed.

27:21.653 --> 27:23.120
You can <i>'</i> t let go?

27:26.858 --> 27:28.519
It <i>'</i> s hard.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.062
Well...

27:40.939 --> 27:43.032
maybe we can take it slow.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.238
Okay?

27:58.990 --> 28:00.457
Hello?

28:01.459 --> 28:04.860
Yeah, Rick. Okay, fine.
All right.

28:06.131 --> 28:07.120
Uh-huh.

28:08.433 --> 28:10.958
Yeah. Okay.

28:11.236 --> 28:13.136
Hey, that is great.

28:16.007 --> 28:18.840
What do you mean there <i>'</i> s
a little scratch on the Ferrari?

28:18.910 --> 28:19.899
Higgins is gonna kill me-

28:21.479 --> 28:22.707
Rick!

28:25.984 --> 28:27.576
Is that the guy
you used to know?

28:27.652 --> 28:31.213
The one with the speech
impediment and the connections?

28:31.590 --> 28:35.856
Yeah, he got an ID on that dune buggy.
I <i>'</i> m gonna go check it out.

28:36.695 --> 28:38.094
What about Walt?

28:38.563 --> 28:41.225
Well, I <i>'</i> m hoping those bozos
can tell me where he is.

28:41.299 --> 28:42.891
I think we can work
something out.

28:43.869 --> 28:46.599
Well, they were kind of rough,
don <i>'</i> t you think? Are you sure-

28:46.671 --> 28:49.105
Karen, that <i>'</i> s
what you hired me to do.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.801
Isn <i>'</i> t it?
Yeah. No, it is.

28:55.146 --> 28:58.172
Are you going surfing today?
What do you think?

28:58.283 --> 29:00.774
Look, stay close to Leah
and your friends, okay?

29:00.852 --> 29:02.376
I <i>'</i> ll have something
this afternoon.

29:02.454 --> 29:04.513
Thomas, are you...

29:04.589 --> 29:06.454
Oh-oh. Someone <i>'</i> s up.

29:08.360 --> 29:13.297
Hey, what about Goldilocks? You
never finished the rest of the story.

29:18.403 --> 29:21.099
 Goldilocks and the Three
Bears <i>wasn't the only story...</i>

29:21.172 --> 29:23.538
<i>that was left unfinished
in Karen's cabin.</i>

29:23.608 --> 29:25.405
<i>And what was nagging about it...</i>

29:25.477 --> 29:29.208
<i>was that I hadn't the slightest
idea how either of them wrapped up.</i>

29:29.714 --> 29:31.181
<i>At least, though...</i>

29:31.249 --> 29:35.242
<i>there's always some comfort to be derived
from the stories that had been wrapped up...</i>

29:35.320 --> 29:38.187
<i>because even though many,
many things have changed...</i>

29:38.990 --> 29:42.721
<i>others have remained the same
and probably always will.</i>

29:43.061 --> 29:46.030
<i>It's these little constants
in life that are comforting.</i>

29:46.498 --> 29:47.931
<i>No way!</i>

29:48.233 --> 29:50.201
Thomas Magnum,
you can forget it.

29:50.268 --> 29:52.998
T.C., it is right near
Kaneohe. That <i>'</i> s not far.

29:53.071 --> 29:54.663
So drive.
Well, I can <i>'</i> t.

29:54.739 --> 29:56.502
The place is kind of
up in the hills...

29:56.574 --> 29:58.940
and I <i>'</i> m down to three
cylinders on the Bug and...

29:59.010 --> 30:01.501
And no way.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.178
T.C., why are you being
so negative?

30:04.249 --> 30:06.717
I <i>'</i> m asking for your help
for a good cause.

30:06.785 --> 30:09.276
Yeah, your case.
My first case!

30:09.387 --> 30:12.049
Well, I <i>'</i> m sorry.
Excuse me.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.394
Thomas, maybe the reason
I <i>'</i> m being so negative is...

30:17.462 --> 30:21.626
I don <i>'</i> t own this chopper that you <i>'</i> re
asking me to fly into God-knows-what.

30:21.700 --> 30:24.635
Well, we <i>'</i> ll be back
in an hour, T.C. I mean...

30:24.970 --> 30:28.531
they <i>'</i> ll never miss it.
Besides, my client is in big trouble.

30:29.007 --> 30:31.066
Well, then, she never
should have hired you.

30:31.142 --> 30:33.633
Look, Thomas, I <i>'</i> m working
two shifts to save up enough money...

30:33.712 --> 30:36.875
to open my own business and you <i>'</i> re
asking me to jeopardize it. Why?

30:36.948 --> 30:39.382
Why? Give me one good reason
why I should do this.

30:39.451 --> 30:40.884
Dang Loc.

30:41.319 --> 30:43.116
And the lizard lady.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.455
Why don <i>'</i> t
we just call the police?

30:50.528 --> 30:53.053
Because I don <i>'</i> t have
any evidence that Joe Soames...

30:53.164 --> 30:55.098
is the guy that ran Karen
off the road.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.964
They <i>'</i> re not going to arrest
him on a license plate from Rick.

30:58.169 --> 31:01.764
Then what do you plan on
doing to him, if I may ask?

31:01.906 --> 31:04.568
I <i>'</i> m simply going to
persuade him...

31:04.642 --> 31:06.803
to leave Karen alone
and let her compete.

31:06.878 --> 31:09.278
Just a little old-fashioned
country hardball.

31:09.848 --> 31:11.782
Man, those guys grow dope
down there...

31:11.850 --> 31:13.750
and you <i>'</i> re going to
play country hardball?

31:13.885 --> 31:16.319
All the more reason
to go after them.

31:19.391 --> 31:20.619
Here it is.

31:21.693 --> 31:24.184
Set her down in that clearing.
Yes, sir.

31:27.399 --> 31:29.390
I am going to go inside...

31:29.901 --> 31:33.632
talk to Soames, and I <i>'</i> ll be
right out. Everything will be okay.

31:34.706 --> 31:36.765
Everything won <i>'</i> t be okay.
What?

31:37.075 --> 31:38.167
Good luck!

31:38.410 --> 31:39.399
Thanks.

31:51.923 --> 31:54.016
<i>It was going to be
quite a while into my career...</i>

31:54.092 --> 31:56.390
<i>before I gave any thought
to writing a book...</i>

31:56.461 --> 31:58.929
<i>on how to be a world-class
private investigator.</i>

31:59.330 --> 32:00.592
<i>But when I did...</i>

32:00.665 --> 32:03.725
<i>I would definitely include
a chapter on rookie mistakes.</i>

32:03.802 --> 32:05.326
<i>Because in retrospect...</i>

32:05.403 --> 32:09.840
<i>calling the police in first would've
been a whole lot simpler and safer.</i>

32:10.341 --> 32:11.467
Hey.

32:13.344 --> 32:14.675
Joe Soames.

32:14.879 --> 32:18.508
You <i>'</i> ve got till three to get in that
chopper and get the hell out of here.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.915
I want to talk to you
about Karen Teel.

32:23.088 --> 32:24.146
One.

32:24.289 --> 32:26.314
Okay, if that <i>'</i> s the way
you want to play it...

32:26.391 --> 32:28.086
I guess I <i>'</i> ll have to
talk to the police.

32:28.159 --> 32:30.059
Starting with attempted murder. Two.

32:30.328 --> 32:33.456
Illegal cultivation of a
controlled substance. Three.

32:34.666 --> 32:36.497
Get down here,
we <i>'</i> ve got a problem.

32:40.138 --> 32:42.299
I wish you hadn <i>'</i> t done that.

33:05.096 --> 33:06.654
Tell them to ease off.

33:08.133 --> 33:09.498
Ease off.

33:11.336 --> 33:12.394
Come here.

33:27.352 --> 33:30.685
Now, you stay away from Karen
Teel or you <i>'</i> re history.

33:30.755 --> 33:32.188
You got that?

33:43.968 --> 33:45.902
Come on, T.C., let <i>'</i> s hit it.

33:45.970 --> 33:48.700
I ought to let them shoot you. T.C.

34:01.286 --> 34:03.652
Don <i>'</i> t worry,
we <i>'</i> re way out of range.

34:07.725 --> 34:10.193
I <i>'</i> ll take care of that.
With what?

34:11.062 --> 34:12.427
Oh, I <i>'</i> m fired.
T.C.

34:12.496 --> 34:15.193
Goodbye business of my
own. Goodbye life. T.C.

34:15.266 --> 34:17.427
I promise. I promise
I <i>'</i> ll make it up to you.

34:17.502 --> 34:20.596
And I also promise this will
never, never happen again.

34:23.908 --> 34:26.775
<i>So much for promises
made in the heat of the moment.</i>

34:27.312 --> 34:29.643
<i>However, at the time,
I did mean it.</i>

34:29.781 --> 34:32.409
<i>Just like I told Sandy
I'd finish The Three Bears...</i>

34:32.483 --> 34:35.077
<i>and just like I told Karen
I'd find Walt.</i>

34:36.254 --> 34:37.619
<i>Well, I did.</i>

34:42.193 --> 34:45.650
<i>He was still in Sydney, happily
raising a family of three...</i>

34:45.830 --> 34:46.888
<i>and more.</i>

34:47.297 --> 34:50.495
<i>Karen didn't have any
restraining order. Just me.</i>

34:54.005 --> 34:55.335
<i>And all I had...</i>

34:55.406 --> 34:57.874
<i>was the make on the dune buggy
that the guys had used...</i>

34:57.942 --> 35:00.467
<i>in the kidnap attempt on Sandy.</i>

35:00.578 --> 35:03.411
<i>And still a lot of
little nagging questions.</i>

35:09.821 --> 35:12.790
<i>Questions which I was
about to get the answers to.</i>

35:12.857 --> 35:16.054
<i>Unfortunately, the answers
weren't what I wanted to hear.</i>

35:26.570 --> 35:28.504
<i>After seeing Karen
with Joe Soames...</i>

35:28.572 --> 35:31.666
<i>the first thing I wanted to do
was pack my bags and go home.</i>

35:32.442 --> 35:35.309
<i>Karen had once asked me
if I believed in déjà vu.</i>

35:36.113 --> 35:37.808
<i>I guess the answer was yes.</i>

35:41.985 --> 35:43.680
Hi, can I come in?

35:44.020 --> 35:45.510
Listen, I thought I <i>'</i> d just...

35:45.589 --> 35:48.456
take this over to the jeweler and
have your name put on it, too...

35:48.525 --> 35:51.426
figuring that it was half yours,
anyway. What are you doing?

35:52.662 --> 35:54.220
Where the hell are you going?

35:55.932 --> 35:58.025
I was just gonna come over
and talk to you.

35:58.368 --> 36:01.235
Oh, that <i>'</i> s decent of you
considering...

36:03.206 --> 36:04.195
Why?

36:05.342 --> 36:07.071
Because it <i>'</i> s not gonna work.

36:10.580 --> 36:13.481
Gee, I thought it was.
Guess I was wrong.

36:15.519 --> 36:17.111
No, you weren <i>'</i> t.

36:18.388 --> 36:20.185
I thought so, too.

36:24.861 --> 36:26.328
I get it.

36:27.731 --> 36:30.632
Hey, listen,
I <i>'</i> m gonna grow old. I promise.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.127
I won <i>'</i> t be
surfing competitively forever.

36:34.771 --> 36:36.762
I mean, that day will come.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.668
I mean, I didn <i>'</i> t want to
admit it yet, but...

36:40.510 --> 36:41.807
I will for you.

36:45.582 --> 36:49.348
Hey, I <i>'</i> ll be your secretary,
you know, like that blonde lady...

36:49.419 --> 36:51.478
in the <i>Maltese Falcon.</i>
You know, devoted.

36:52.489 --> 36:53.751
Please, Thomas.

36:56.226 --> 36:57.625
I <i>'</i> ll be around.

36:57.994 --> 36:59.689
So will I, Karen.

37:02.466 --> 37:04.093
But so will Michelle.

37:05.869 --> 37:08.235
Michelle, Michelle.
Okay, okay, I...

37:09.239 --> 37:12.970
I won <i>'</i> t say that it <i>'</i> s been
a long time. I won <i>'</i> t. I promise.

37:14.044 --> 37:17.104
Look, I tried, Karen.

37:20.016 --> 37:21.381
I really...

37:23.053 --> 37:24.918
I wanted this to work.

37:30.393 --> 37:32.884
I think it <i>'</i> s more
than just Michelle.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.598
Well, you get around,
I gotta say.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.226
Look, I know I <i>'</i> m not
doing this too well.

37:39.302 --> 37:40.496
That <i>'</i> s true.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.533
I can <i>'</i> t even make sense
of this for myself.

37:45.609 --> 37:47.975
I <i>'</i> m just trying to tell you
how I feel.

37:48.945 --> 37:50.037
Sorry.

37:51.081 --> 37:52.810
Tell me how you feel.

37:53.917 --> 37:56.943
Look, all I <i>'</i> m saying is...

37:57.153 --> 38:00.816
without this client <i>I</i> private
investigator thing, where would we be?

38:00.891 --> 38:03.257
I mean, what if we met
in a line at a supermarket?

38:03.326 --> 38:05.817
Something tells me
I <i>'</i> m not gonna find out.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.055
Karen, you know,
all through this case...

38:09.132 --> 38:11.965
I <i>'</i> ve had a pretty good run
of beginner <i>'</i> s luck.

38:12.669 --> 38:15.570
But I just feel like some kind
of fairy tale hero and now-

38:15.639 --> 38:18.301
And now you <i>'</i> re ready for
the next bedtime story, right?

38:18.408 --> 38:21.741
Well, do me a favor. Next time try
something a little more innocuous like...

38:21.845 --> 38:23.972
<i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</i>

38:24.047 --> 38:27.448
Save the heavy stuff for someone
who can deal with it. I can <i>'</i> t.

38:38.528 --> 38:40.325
Here, take it.

38:53.510 --> 38:54.943
Remember me.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.009
<i>Thomas!</i>

39:05.155 --> 39:07.350
Thomas, wait, please.
Why, Karen?

39:07.424 --> 39:09.892
Please listen to me.
<i>'</i> Cause I think I owe you.

39:10.126 --> 39:13.118
Forget it, all bets are off.
We both got lives to go back to.

39:13.196 --> 39:14.527
Yeah, well, I don <i>'</i> t.

39:14.598 --> 39:17.692
And I haven <i>'</i> t for five years.
I need for you to listen to me, please.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.064
<i>'</i> Cause you owe me, too.

39:19.436 --> 39:23.133
I owe you? For you lying
to me? For you using me?

39:23.206 --> 39:25.140
I just want you to understand.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.369
I need for you to understand
how I feel.

39:29.245 --> 39:30.337
All right.

39:30.814 --> 39:33.282
Tell me how you feel.
Not great!

39:35.685 --> 39:37.516
But I wanna tell you the truth.

39:41.524 --> 39:45.119
See, when you left to pursue your career,
I immediately hooked up with Walt.

39:45.795 --> 39:47.660
Well, not immediately, but soon.

39:48.365 --> 39:49.423
Too soon.

39:50.433 --> 39:54.164
He left me with Sandy and a former
career as a world surfing champ.

39:55.372 --> 39:58.432
So between the baby
and waitressing at The Curl...

39:58.808 --> 40:00.776
I was effectively through.

40:02.178 --> 40:04.806
But you know me.
Can <i>'</i> t keep me down.

40:06.616 --> 40:07.810
So in <i>'</i> 81...

40:07.884 --> 40:10.717
when Sandy was old enough for
people to take care of her...

40:11.287 --> 40:12.982
I decided to go for it.

40:13.390 --> 40:15.654
To make a comeback.
And so did Joe Soames.

40:16.593 --> 40:19.061
He served 16 months.
I know that!

40:19.696 --> 40:22.392
Yeah, but what you don <i>'</i> t know
is that when he came back...

40:22.732 --> 40:25.098
he started back the same way,
promoting talent.

40:26.236 --> 40:28.431
Of course this time
he cut out the <i>pakalolo</i>.

40:28.505 --> 40:30.473
Of course this time you gave in.

40:31.875 --> 40:32.864
Yeah.

40:34.811 --> 40:37.837
It was like one of those
old prize fight movies.

40:38.748 --> 40:42.548
You know, Sandy and I were starving and
I didn <i>'</i> t know if I could cut it.

40:44.220 --> 40:47.053
But Joe did, he knew. Only he
didn <i>'</i> t wanna chance it.

40:48.658 --> 40:50.592
So he paid me to take a dive.

40:51.895 --> 40:53.157
Literally.

40:55.031 --> 40:57.261
That <i>'</i> s why I didn <i>'</i> t make it
to the semis.

40:58.835 --> 41:00.826
So now you feel like you <i>'</i> re
running out of time...

41:00.904 --> 41:02.496
and you can <i>'</i> t live with that.

41:02.572 --> 41:04.631
And you decide you want
one more moment of glory...

41:04.708 --> 41:05.902
and to hell with Joe Soames...

41:05.975 --> 41:08.773
and to hell with the truth. And you
know just the right person to call.

41:08.845 --> 41:10.403
Well, I <i>'</i> m sorry, Karen.

41:11.281 --> 41:12.612
I am, too.

41:13.450 --> 41:14.849
I really am.

41:15.952 --> 41:17.886
See, I thought
if maybe I could...

41:18.588 --> 41:20.180
stack the deck that...

41:20.957 --> 41:24.120
I could have
my surfing career and...

41:26.296 --> 41:28.161
maybe you <i>'</i> d stick around
this time.

41:31.401 --> 41:33.369
I <i>'</i> m sorry I hurt you, Thomas.

41:36.106 --> 41:38.074
I <i>'</i> m sorry it didn <i>'</i> t work out.

41:40.844 --> 41:41.970
Me, too.

41:46.783 --> 41:50.981
You know, it <i>'</i> s funny, I can remember
five years ago like it was yesterday.

41:52.856 --> 41:54.881
And I can remember
what you said.

41:56.392 --> 41:58.690
That you can <i>'</i> t lay abstract words like
<i>"</i> ethics <i>"</i> and <i>"</i> ideals <i>"</i>...

41:58.762 --> 41:59.786
on your feelings...

41:59.863 --> 42:01.626
<i>'</i> cause they don <i>'</i> t apply.

42:03.533 --> 42:04.693
Well...

42:05.335 --> 42:06.825
I believe you can.

42:07.670 --> 42:10.605
And I believe you should.
Goodbye, Karen.

42:20.850 --> 42:22.511
I believe I did.

42:22.619 --> 42:25.611
I was in the bar
telling Joe Soames I quit.

42:25.789 --> 42:27.780
I quit, Thomas. I quit.

42:29.559 --> 42:31.220
Goodbye, Thomas.

42:41.004 --> 42:43.370
I see you were
unable to return the trophy...

42:43.439 --> 42:44.770
to the beauty contestants.

42:45.241 --> 42:47.573
Turned their fingers
green, did it? Higgins.

42:50.547 --> 42:53.914
"The 1979 North Shore
Surf-Out.<i>"</i> Give it to me.

42:55.084 --> 42:56.813
Something to do with your case?

43:00.456 --> 43:04.790
I remember a similar
competition I was a part of.

43:05.562 --> 43:08.690
Off the Moroccan coast.
<i>'</i> 44, it was.

43:09.232 --> 43:10.563
Of course, there was a war on...

43:10.633 --> 43:13.193
and we didn <i>'</i> t actually
have surfboards as you know them.

43:13.269 --> 43:15.737
More like the wing assemblies
of a couple of Messerschmidts...

43:15.805 --> 43:17.466
our lads had managed
to shoot down.

43:17.540 --> 43:19.405
You surfed on airplane wings?

43:19.475 --> 43:22.171
Mmm. Quite exhilarating
when you got the hang of it.

43:22.412 --> 43:25.438
I <i>'</i> d organized the competition
to boost the unit <i>'</i> s morale...

43:25.515 --> 43:28.040
bogged down in Rabat
for six months as we were.

43:28.418 --> 43:30.978
At any rate, I was unable
to win the trophy...

43:31.054 --> 43:35.184
finishing sixth, I believe, behind
Corky Bostwick, Binky Farnbush-

43:35.258 --> 43:37.385
You surfed on airplane wings.

43:37.827 --> 43:39.692
I just said that, didn <i>'</i> t I?

43:41.097 --> 43:43.895
At any rate, even though I was
unable to win anything...

43:44.467 --> 43:49.063
I think that competition was possibly one
of the most memorable moments of my life.

43:51.207 --> 43:52.435
Why?

43:54.143 --> 43:57.544
Because for the
first time in my life...

43:58.047 --> 43:59.947
I was able to tempt death...

44:00.216 --> 44:03.014
without actually
killing in the process.

44:03.686 --> 44:08.123
Just the feeling of being
inside such power and strength...

44:08.558 --> 44:11.493
and controlling it
was indescribable.

44:12.395 --> 44:17.128
I believe that just the opportunity
to test the Fates in such a manner...

44:17.667 --> 44:21.125
gives one the ability to put
one <i>'</i> s whole life into perspective.

44:22.372 --> 44:25.136
For the better one feels
about one <i>'</i> s self...

44:25.675 --> 44:29.577
the better the rest of
the world looks, indeed.

44:32.649 --> 44:34.674
Wouldn <i>'</i> t you agree, Magnum?

44:38.588 --> 44:40.453
There <i>'</i> s one thing I gotta know.

44:42.258 --> 44:46.251
Was that story the truth? Did
you really surf on airplane wings?

44:48.464 --> 44:50.398
Don <i>'</i> t be absurd, Magnum.

44:51.034 --> 44:54.265
Who would be insane enough to
do something as bizarre as that?

44:54.570 --> 44:58.131
My God, man,
there was a war going on.

45:00.476 --> 45:01.909
I thought so.

45:02.445 --> 45:04.845
But thanks anyway.
It was very helpful.

45:04.914 --> 45:07.712
I beg your pardon?
Where are you going now?

45:08.584 --> 45:10.279
To test the Fates.

45:24.067 --> 45:25.329
Hiya, Joe.

45:33.109 --> 45:34.337
Magnum.

45:37.814 --> 45:40.146
You want me to count
to three again, huh?

45:40.850 --> 45:44.445
Only this time, it won <i>'</i> t
add up to 16 months.

45:44.821 --> 45:47.585
I <i>'</i> m looking for Karen Teel.
You <i>'</i> re too late.

45:48.491 --> 45:51.517
She quit the competition. One.

45:52.328 --> 45:53.886
She just re-entered.

45:54.630 --> 45:57.622
Dumb. Very dumb of her. Two.

46:00.470 --> 46:01.459
Three.

46:05.808 --> 46:06.968
Hold it.

46:08.277 --> 46:09.403
He <i>'</i> s mine.

46:48.217 --> 46:49.878
<i>Maybe the years did creep by...</i>

46:49.952 --> 46:51.749
<i>without me
really missing them...</i>

46:51.821 --> 46:53.482
<i>until somehow I got lucky...</i>

46:53.556 --> 46:56.992
<i>and got an opportunity to look in the
mirror and see where they'd gone.</i>

46:57.427 --> 46:59.361
<i>I know they did for Karen.</i>

47:00.496 --> 47:03.397
<i>And I know that having had the
chance to see her once again...</i>

47:03.466 --> 47:05.400
<i>made me realize
that yesterday...</i>

47:05.468 --> 47:08.266
<i>was just a blink of an eyelid
away from being tomorrow.</i>

47:29.592 --> 47:31.355
<i>Maybe Thomas Wolfe was right.</i>

47:31.427 --> 47:33.486
<i>Maybe you can't go home again.</i>

47:41.737 --> 47:44.297
<i>But it sure as hell
was worth the try.</i>
