My name is Clareece "Precious" Jones.

01:20.246 --> 01:24.416
I wish I had a light-skinned boyfriend
with real nice hair.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.044
And I wanna be on the cover of a magazine.

01:27.128 --> 01:30.506
But first, I wanna be
in one of them BET videos.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.925
Momma said I can't dance.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.512
Plus, she said, who wants
to see my big ass dancing, anyhow?

01:36.596 --> 01:40.265
Well, if there's no volunteers,
then I'm going to have to call people.

01:40.350 --> 01:44.186
Okay, Leticia, you got number one. Leticia!

01:44.270 --> 01:45.646
Jess Wesley, number two.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.857
I like math. I don't say nothing.

01:49.692 --> 01:53.112
I don't open my book, even. 
I just sit there.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.738
- You down?
- Number six.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.784
Every day I tell myself
something's gonna happen.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.993
I知... I知 dead serious.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.412
Like, I'm gonna break through.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.707
Or somebody's gonna break through to me.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.418
I'm gonna be normal

02:08.502 --> 02:11.421
and pay attention,
and sit in the front of the class.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.715
Distributive principles...

02:13.800 --> 02:14.883
Someday.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.219
...are principles that
you can do in your head.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.388
I like Mr. Wicher.

02:20.348 --> 02:24.726
I pretend he my husband
and we live someplace like Westchester.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.439
Look at him. He like me, too, I know it.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.987
I can tell by his eyes.
He always looking at me and smiling at me.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.156
Boys! Boys! Boys!

02:37.240 --> 02:38.448
I知 not your fucking boy!

02:38.533 --> 02:39.658
You're disrupting the class.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.161
Yeah, well, I知 talking now,
so you listen.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.831
Shut the fuck up! I知 trying to listen!

02:49.085 --> 02:51.420
Mr. Wicher know I got his back.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.380
One twenty-two.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.050
Why are we barking, Jess?

02:57.594 --> 03:02.014
Monday's assignment.
I知 assuming everybody did it.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.433
- No.
- No.

03:07.770 --> 03:12.482
Please... Quiet. Precious, get your things.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.651
I have... Come here for a second.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.861
Now this shit.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.947
Is there anybody
who didn't do their homework?

03:21.451 --> 03:26.246
Why? These aren't requests.
These are requirements. Okay?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.836
You have to go to the principal's office.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.848
Go to the principal's office!

03:44.933 --> 03:47.851
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.313
No, he's not allowed on campus.
Where was he seen?

03:51.439 --> 03:53.315
Could you get Mr. Tork from Room 25,

03:53.399 --> 03:55.817
tell him to go to Room 16 right away?
Thank you.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.654
No. He was seen on the second floor.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.490
Yes. Thank you.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.742
Send Clareece in here!

04:06.996 --> 04:08.997
She's ready for you now.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.962
Mr. Taylor? Ms. Lichenstein.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.755
Come in.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.507
Matthew Williams, second floor.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.637
In front of his locker.
Yes. Suspended last week.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.557
Yeah.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.310
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.272
Hello, Clareece.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.070
Are you pregnant?

04:47.370 --> 04:51.415
You're 16. 
You're still in junior high school,

04:53.209 --> 04:56.128
and you're pregnant with your second child.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.380
Is that correct, Clareece?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.093
Are you pregnant again?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.769
What happened, Clareece?

05:12.854 --> 05:15.564
I had sex, Ms. Lichenstein.

05:20.987 --> 05:25.032
Do you have any other thoughts
about your situation, Clareece?

05:30.246 --> 05:31.621
Clareece?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.749
Am I in trouble?

05:35.585 --> 05:38.337
Thank you. I gotta get back to math.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.506
Sit down, Clareece. Sit down right now.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.512
We should have a parent-teacher's
conference with you, me and your mother.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.681
My mother's busy.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.100
All right. Well then,
how about if I come to your house?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.144
If I were you, I wouldn't.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.938
I... I知 going to have to suspend you.

05:58.107 --> 06:01.109
That ain't fair! I didn't do nothing!
I do my work!

06:01.194 --> 06:02.277
My grades is good!

06:02.362 --> 06:04.279
Is something going on at home?

06:04.364 --> 06:08.492
If something's going on at home,
I want you to tell me right now.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.297
You get my cigarettes?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.549
No, they didn't have it.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.886
I played the number, though.
I couldn't box it.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.374
Yes. Yeah.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.045
Right there. Yeah. Daddy loves you.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.098
Precious, what did you think of the film?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.349
I thought it was fabulous.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.935
- What's next for you?
- What?

07:17.019 --> 07:19.604
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great!

07:21.566 --> 07:23.108
Just one more, just one more, quick!

07:23.192 --> 07:24.818
I love you, too!

07:27.196 --> 07:28.405
You know I love you!

07:28.489 --> 07:30.073
Hey, boo!

07:38.374 --> 07:40.584
I ain't gonna say it no more.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.924
The door was open, so I let myself in.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.386
Well, there goes my chance
to tell you I'm not home.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.680
Now, Mary, this is important.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.228
Now, come on, Mary,
she'll have a great time.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.732
I'd enroll myself, but I became ineligible
for teen pageants a few days ago.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.611
Yeah, I see your acne's cleared up.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.864
You know, this pageant can do Brenda
a world of good, Mary.

08:10.948 --> 08:14.618
And the man in charge, he's tops
in his field. A brilliant promoter.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.786
How long have you two been dating?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.332
A dance teacher.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.212
Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.964
I hate crackheads.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.551
No one ever ring this bell
except for crackheads.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.761
Why they fucking with us?

08:38.267 --> 08:41.645
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzers,
motherfuckers!

08:41.729 --> 08:43.897
Give the ghetto a bad name.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.113
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzer!

09:01.707 --> 09:04.834
Stop it!

09:05.294 --> 09:07.295
Press "listen," stupid.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.471
It's Sandra Lichenstein
for Clareece and Ms. Mary Johnston.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.476
Who is that, Precious?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.062
White bitch from school.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.154
What do you want?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.158
Clareece, I want to talk to you
about your education.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.914
Eighty-six that bitch.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.750
My mother don't wanna get cut off welfare.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.378
And that's just what this visit
gonna result in.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.426
Ms. Lichenstein, get out of here
before I kick your ass.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.761
All right, Clareece, I spoke to Mr. Wicher,

09:56.846 --> 09:59.681
and he told me
that you're one of his best math students.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.726
If your fat ass don't get
that bitch away from here...

10:02.810 --> 10:05.437
...like a, like a potential for math.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.063
So I called Mrs. McKnight

10:07.148 --> 10:11.276

Each One Teach One.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.279
It痴 an alternative school.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.365
Clareece, are you listening to me?

10:18.034 --> 10:18.992
Yeah.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.954
Okay. Mrs. McKnight. Each One Teach One.

10:23.164 --> 10:29.044
It痴 located at the 11th floor,
Hotel Theresa, 125th Street.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.005
- Get rid of that bitch.
- The semester started a few days ago,

10:32.089 --> 10:33.131
so you're not too late.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.758
Eleventh floor.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.843
I heard you the first time.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.970
Okay.

10:40.389 --> 10:44.726
I don't know what an alternative school is,
but I feel I wanna know.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.938
My heart is all warm inside.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.442
Mr. Wicher think I'm a good student.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.945
I knew that he liked me.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.468
School ain't gonna help none!

11:18.552 --> 11:21.096
Take your ass down to the welfare.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.431
Who the fuck she think she is?

11:24.350 --> 11:29.187
So I guess you think you cute now, right?
Uppity bitch.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.273
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.152
Just 'cause he gonna give you
more children than he give me,

11:36.237 --> 11:38.488

11:38.572 --> 11:40.573
Fuck you and fuck him!

11:45.037 --> 11:46.329

11:48.457 --> 11:50.750
Precious! Precious!

11:51.794 --> 11:53.378
Get down here, bitch!

11:53.462 --> 11:55.839
You brought that white bitch up
in my house!

11:56.757 --> 11:58.675
You...
Why would you bring that bitch up in here?

11:58.759 --> 11:59.801
I didn't bring her here.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.762
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.598
I can't hear you, Precious.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.726
Since you got
so much motherfucking mouth,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.477
and you gonna bring a bitch up
in my house,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.604
why would that bitch ring
my goddamn buzzer?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.398
I didn't tell her to come here.

12:13.482 --> 12:17.193
See, I think right now, you feeling
like you're becoming a grown woman.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.112
'Cause of that shit you pulled
in the kitchen.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.574
I should've fucked you up,
but I let you walk away,

12:22.658 --> 12:24.576
and I let you come get yourself together.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.704
But, bitch, I知 gonna let you know
if you ever pull that shit on me again,

12:27.788 --> 12:30.331

motherfucking day standing,

12:30.416 --> 12:31.416
I promise you that.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.043
You gonna send a white bitch
to my motherfucking buzzer?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.754
Talking about some higher education?

12:35.838 --> 12:39.090
You're a dummy, bitch,
you will never know shit.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.468
Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.179
You done fucked around
and fucked my motherfucking man

12:44.263 --> 12:46.181
and had two motherfucking children,

12:46.265 --> 12:47.932
and one of them is a goddamn animal,

12:48.017 --> 12:51.102

looking crazy as a motherfucker.

12:51.187 --> 12:55.190
Bitch, you know what?
See, I think you... I think you're trying me.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.778
I think you're really trying to fuck with me.
You're fucking with my money.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.946
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

13:02.031 --> 13:03.615
like you're a motherfucking woman.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.658
I知 gonna show you
what real women do, bitch.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.203
See, you don't know
what real motherfucking women do.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.246
Real motherfucking women sacrifice.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.708
I should've aborted your motherfucking ass.
'Cause you ain't shit.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.377
I knew it the day the doctors put you
in my goddamn hand

13:16.462 --> 13:17.962

13:18.047 --> 13:20.340
and you have that smirk

13:20.424 --> 13:22.133
Get it off your fucking face!

13:22.218 --> 13:25.804
Now smile about that!
Smile about that, you fat bitch.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.518
I知 gonna kill you, bitch!

13:41.403 --> 13:43.154
Get off me, bitch!

13:45.407 --> 13:46.825
And "blank" and eggs?

13:46.909 --> 13:48.243

- Muffin!

14:03.926 --> 14:05.718
- Right.
- That's it!

14:14.353 --> 14:16.813
You really need to get some rest.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.691
You have such a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.944
And remember, Mommy loves you.

14:26.282 --> 14:31.619
Describe these things that are planned.
Things that are planned. Ready? Go!

14:34.790 --> 14:37.917
Precious, you know I love you.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.004
I知 gonna kick that white lady
out of my house,

14:41.088 --> 14:42.922

14:43.007 --> 14:45.133
Wanna live in Westchester?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.303

- Crime.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.346
And this is you get back together again.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.472

And this is when you're like this,

14:53.142 --> 14:54.392

- Pregnant.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.936
- Yeah. And this is you make a fast...
- Escape.

- Right.
- That's it!

15:31.305 --> 15:35.266
Where you going?

15:35.517 --> 15:39.520
Make sure you play my 852
and tell them to box it.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.193
And get some kitty litter.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.449
Ethel, where you at?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.621
Precious, what are we gonna play?

15:56.705 --> 15:57.705
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.248
Ain't you supposed to be
at school or something?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.959
You said we was gonna play.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.169
That's exactly why
we ain't gonna be playing.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.837
I never said nothing like that.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.694
You would say some shit like that to me,
and you don't even mean it?

17:10.779 --> 17:14.949
No, I知 not playing with you.
No, and she call... Hold on.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.411
Each One Teach One, hold, please.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.415
Yes. She called my house.
I know it wasn't your sister, Trey.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.042
Because it wasn't her.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.506
What this is here?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.467
Each One Teach One.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.386
I知 looking for an alternative school.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.263
This is an alternative.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.474
What alternative is?

17:39.558 --> 17:42.018
What exactly are you asking me?

17:42.102 --> 17:44.145
Lady at my other school
told me to come here.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.565
Hotel Theresa.
Said it's an alternative school.

17:47.649 --> 17:53.696
An alternative school, it's like a choice.
It痴 a different way of doing things.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.450
So, I need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.453
I got kicked out of school
'cause I was pregnant.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.414
Well, I still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.541
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.960
You the one she called about.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.506
Clareece P. Jones?

18:12.007 --> 18:15.343
They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.053
I could start today?

18:17.137 --> 18:20.473
Yeah. Are you currently receiving AFDC?

18:20.557 --> 18:23.601
My mother get AFDC
for me and my daughter.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.896
So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.941
Okay, well, I知 gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,

18:30.025 --> 18:33.027
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.405
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,

18:36.490 --> 18:38.157
see where to place you.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.661
Hold on, baby. Each One Teach One, hold.

18:42.579 --> 18:47.125
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.742
There's always something wrong
with these tests.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.955
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.333
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,

19:29.418 --> 19:31.878
my whole family, as less than dumb.

19:31.962 --> 19:36.048
Just ugly, black grease to be wiped away,
find another job for.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.052
Sometimes I wish I was dead.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.433
I'll be okay, I guess, 
'cause I'm looking up.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.188
I'm looking up for a piano to fall.

19:50.272 --> 19:54.233
Or a desk, couch, TV... Momma, maybe.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.445
Always something in my way.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.780
Yeah, man.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.116
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.701
Alternative.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.786
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.164
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.124
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.168
It is what it is.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.337
Then my mind come back down to Earth.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.965
Let me get some of that sweet ass, orca!

20:18.467 --> 20:19.467
What up, mama?

20:19.551 --> 20:21.594
Why boys always grabbing on themselves?

20:21.678 --> 20:25.514
You heard what the fuck I said?
I said give me some fucking ass.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.392
I知 serious!
When you gonna let me hit that?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.518
That bitch is laughing...

20:29.603 --> 20:30.978
I wish they'd leave me alone.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.064
- She's stupid.
- Yeah.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.610
Yo, that's not even funny.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.488
That's what she'd get anyway, no.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.492
Precious!

22:44.279 --> 22:47.239
Ma, I need some money!

22:51.536 --> 22:53.162
Ma, I知 hungry!

22:55.248 --> 22:57.792
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.091
I wish she'd stop this shit.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.100
The other day I cried.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.854
I felt stupid. But you know what?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.065
Fuck that day.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.195
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.656
Still hungry, though.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.831
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.542
They're my kids.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.589
- What d'you want, baby?
- Give me a basket, please.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.508
- Sides?
- I don't know yet.

23:47.592 --> 23:51.220
Still thinking about it.
Trying to watch my figure.

23:55.058 --> 23:58.060
Butchie, you got a 10-piece ready?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.375
Potato salad.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.043
Thank you.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.885
Hell, no, she didn't!

24:31.470 --> 24:33.929
Get her ass! Get that big bitch!

25:07.422 --> 25:10.049
No, I am not the one.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.325
You in ABE?

26:20.370 --> 26:21.495
Yeah.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.873
Time's a-wasting.

26:48.189 --> 26:49.898
What's your name?

26:50.734 --> 26:52.192
Clareece.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.154
Are you coming in?

27:01.578 --> 27:04.038
That door closes in 20 seconds.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.712
How are you guys doing today?

27:13.214 --> 27:15.799
Would you like to join us, Consuelo?

27:16.926 --> 27:19.470
Consuelo, class is beginning.

27:22.599 --> 27:25.768
You guys know
that you are in the ABE class.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.772
This is not GED.
This is to get you ready for your GED.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.380
These journals are very important
to this class, so do not forget them.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.840
You will need to use them every day
that you are here.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.384
They are the key to this class.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.802
It痴 9:07, Joann. You're late.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.513
You're the one who said breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.557
Tomorrow, that door will be locked at 9:00.

28:08.728 --> 28:12.523
I want you to state your name,
where you were born,

28:12.607 --> 28:17.277
your favorite color, something you do well
and why you're here.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.155
I'll go first.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.782

28:22.659 --> 28:24.827

28:24.911 --> 28:26.578
...is Blu Rain.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.914

- Yes, it is.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.458
Your first name's Blu?

28:34.671 --> 28:38.966
My favorite color is purple. I sing well.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.885
And I知 here

28:44.723 --> 28:46.807
because I love to teach.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.350
She like to sing.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.893
Rhonda?

28:49.978 --> 28:53.981
I wish I could sing.
Go to church and sing in the choir.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.233
Show them how it's done.

28:56.317 --> 29:01.029
All right.
My name is Rhonda Patrice Johnson.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.241
Problem?

29:05.618 --> 29:07.536
- I should smack her.
- What?

29:07.620 --> 29:13.167
I was born in Kingston, Jamaica,
and my favorite color is blue.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.252
And I cook good.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.963
My mother, she used to have a restaurant
over on 7th Avenue.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.632
Before she get sick,
she teach me everything.

29:20.717 --> 29:24.553
So I知 here to get my reading up,
so I can get my GED.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.353
My name is Rita Romero.
I was born here in Harlem.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.692
I知 here 'cause I was an addict
and I dropped out of school.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.654
So I never got
my reading and writing together.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.990
My favorite color's black.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.450
What do you do good?

29:46.534 --> 29:49.286
"Well," Joann. "What do you do well?"

29:49.370 --> 29:52.289
- What do I do well?
- No. Rita?

29:52.916 --> 29:55.626
I知 a good mother. Very good mother.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.090
My name's Jermaine.
My favorite color is red.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.301
Tell us where you were born first.

30:04.385 --> 30:07.554
I was born in the Bronx. Still live there.

30:07.639 --> 30:11.558
My favorite color is red. Used to be blue.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.145
I can dance real good.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.439
Homie of mine told me
about Each One Teach One,

30:17.524 --> 30:20.275
so I came here to stay out of trouble.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.153
So you came here to Harlem
to stay out of trouble? Is that right?

30:23.238 --> 30:24.613
Yeah.

30:24.697 --> 30:27.366
- Consuelo?
- This is bullshit.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.992
You think so?

30:33.748 --> 30:35.123
Clareece?

30:37.752 --> 30:39.419
Can I skip, too?

30:41.422 --> 30:42.881
Joann?

30:42.966 --> 30:46.426
Okay. I知 Joann. Hey.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.265
My favorite color is fluorescent beige

30:51.349 --> 30:54.226
and my ambition is to have
my own record layer.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.352
What's a record layer?

30:55.436 --> 30:58.355
Tell us where you come from
and why you come to this school.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.399
I was born in Kings County Hospital,

31:00.483 --> 31:02.901
but my mother moved us to Harlem
when I was nine.

31:02.986 --> 31:08.031
I知 here to get my GED, and then...
Well, I知 already into the music industry.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.702
I知 just trying to take care of
this little education thing so I can move up.

31:11.786 --> 31:16.832
Let's begin. This is ABE.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.250
Can I go?

31:23.840 --> 31:27.134
I wish I could sit
in the back of the class again.

31:35.643 --> 31:39.688
My name Clareece "Precious" Jones.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.566
I go by Precious.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.696
I live in Harlem. I like yellow.

31:48.781 --> 31:54.828
And I had problems at my other school,
so I come here.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.082
Something you do well?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.961
Nothing.

32:03.671 --> 32:06.006
Everybody's good at something.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.469
Come on.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.809
Well, I can cook. And...

32:20.271 --> 32:23.065
I never really talked in class before.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.196
How does that make you feel?

32:36.579 --> 32:37.746
Here.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.543
It makes me feel here.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.006
Everybody open their journal.

32:48.091 --> 32:52.135
Write the date at the top of the page,
and write.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.931
I don't care if you spell everything wrong.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.141
I don't care if it's grammatically incorrect.
But just write.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.935
Write anything that you're feeling.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.354
This class will be a revolving door.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.607
Some of you will make it
and some of you won't.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.069
Fifteen minutes. Go.

33:11.864 --> 33:17.077
Before, I got a A-minus at English,
and I didn't have to say nothing.

33:18.371 --> 33:22.499
Ms. Rain said we gonna read
and write in our notebooks every day.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.751
How we supposed to do that?

33:27.422 --> 33:30.340
But then she see the worry on my face
and she say,

33:30.425 --> 33:33.593
"The longest journey
begin with a single step. "

33:35.972 --> 33:38.890
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.518
Come on, come on, do the work.

33:41.602 --> 33:45.022
You love it, love it, learn it.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.482
Consuelo?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.110
"C" for Consuelo.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.320
"C" for kick your ass.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.740
It痴 "K" for kick your ass, stupid.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.825
I got the "D," Ms. Rain.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.664
"D" for dick.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.625
Ms. Rain, tell this little-ass bitch
that she don't know me.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.669
Which you wish you had.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.094
- Help her.
- "E."

34:17.179 --> 34:21.808
"E."

34:48.335 --> 34:49.878
"F" for fat.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.547
What?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.174
Good.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.847
Hey! Hey! Hey! Quit it! Hey!

35:01.974 --> 35:03.850
- What?
- Hey, you stop it right now!

35:03.935 --> 35:05.477
- You fucking...
- Quit it!

35:05.561 --> 35:06.686
- She just hit me!
- Drop it!

35:06.771 --> 35:07.896
Shut the fuck up!

35:09.148 --> 35:10.232
She just slapped me!

35:10.316 --> 35:11.650
Get out.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.986
We don't fight in my class. Sit down.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.701
"C" for cold.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.255
Do you live with anybody?

35:34.590 --> 35:36.007
My mother.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.385
What does she do?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.430
She don't do nothing.

35:46.018 --> 35:48.895
I want you to read a page from this book.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.321
Try.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.910
All I need you to do is sound out
these words for me.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.537
You don't have to know every word.

36:05.621 --> 36:09.332
You just have to... It doesn't matter
if you stumble or... Try for me...

36:09.417 --> 36:13.545
...or trip up on it.
You just need to say what you know.

36:13.629 --> 36:17.257
Come on. You can do this.
Try. Take it word by word.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.926
- Are you listening to me?
- Precious!

36:20.011 --> 36:23.013
I just wanna know where you are
in your reading skills.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.389
'Cause I知 looking at your test scores...

36:24.473 --> 36:26.975
Some higher fucking learning.
You're a dumb bitch!

36:27.059 --> 36:28.685
Try to read, okay?

36:28.769 --> 36:31.104
Just help me and then I can help you.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.607
We'll start from scratch. Word for word.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.234
I want you better than your mother.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.696
- I知 gonna call the nurse.
- No.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.120
It all look the same to me.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.375
What's this?

36:54.754 --> 36:57.130
I can't do that, Ms. Rain.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.841
Push yourself.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.637
A.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.890
What's this word?

37:12.104 --> 37:14.940
Do you know the letters? Come on.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.651
"D."

37:20.905 --> 37:22.280
"A."

37:23.866 --> 37:25.242
"Y."

37:25.993 --> 37:27.994
Do you know that word?

37:30.498 --> 37:31.706
"Day. "

37:33.834 --> 37:35.627
What word is that?

37:37.672 --> 37:39.506
Ate. Ate.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.008

The word is "Shore. "
It痴 almost like "Beach. "

37:58.234 --> 37:59.693

38:00.319 --> 38:02.862

38:14.792 --> 38:16.209

38:23.968 --> 38:26.052
Get your big ass in here.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.026
Where was you at this morning?

38:47.700 --> 38:50.201

Where was you at this morning?

38:50.286 --> 38:52.662

38:54.248 --> 38:56.249

38:56.834 --> 38:59.336
The welfare done called here saying
they gonna remove you from my budget

38:59.420 --> 39:01.296
'cause you ain't been

39:01.380 --> 39:03.089
I told you I got kicked out.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.216
I been home nearly every day

39:05.301 --> 39:08.678
You ain't told me nothing

39:08.763 --> 39:11.765
I told you I was going
to school this morning.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.644
You plan on putting some food

39:22.151 --> 39:24.486

39:24.570 --> 39:26.696

39:26.781 --> 39:28.365
You understand?

39:29.283 --> 39:30.742
Yes, ma'am.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.872
You need to forget about that school shit
and take your ass down to the welfare.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.791
I知 getting a stipend from school.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.085
Fool, what the fuck is a stipend?
What is that?

39:40.169 --> 39:43.755
Fuck a stipend.
I said take your ass down to the welfare.

39:43.839 --> 39:44.964

39:52.807 --> 39:54.432
Fucking stupid.

39:58.104 --> 40:01.773
You think you're too good now?
Is that what it is?

40:02.566 --> 40:05.485
You think you is too good for the welfare?

40:08.739 --> 40:13.118
There's more white folk getting assistance
than it is niggers, Ms. Onassis.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.538
I think I said therapy...

40:16.622 --> 40:20.375
Hurry your ass up.
I am in here fucking starving.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.752
Now what you gonna do

40:34.682 --> 40:36.141
Well, they don't know
who the fuck they teaching,

40:36.225 --> 40:38.393
'cause you can't learn shit.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.813
Keep on listening to them white people.

40:41.897 --> 40:44.566
That's what's gonna get you fucked up.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.404
Precious, I知 hungry.

41:15.389 --> 41:19.225
You ain't cooked no collard greens
with the fucking pigs' feet?

41:19.727 --> 41:22.729
Like, how am I supposed to eat pigs' feet
with no collard greens?

41:22.813 --> 41:26.649
And why in the fuck does that pigs' feet
have so much hair in it?

41:26.734 --> 41:30.028
You eat it. You come eat this shit.

41:30.112 --> 41:32.405
- I知 not hungry, though.
- Yes, you is.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.658
Precious, if you don't get
this goddamn plate...

41:41.081 --> 41:45.585
You just fix mine when you get done.
Since you fucked it up, you gonna eat it up.

41:46.086 --> 41:49.005
Hurry up and eat, Precious.
I知 fucking hungry, too.

41:51.091 --> 41:55.470
And don't let it get cold,
'cause cold-ass pigs' feet is nasty as shit.

44:04.141 --> 44:07.352
So, tell me about...
Tell me about your home life.

44:10.397 --> 44:12.899
Ain't nothing to really talk about.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.902
You're in a safe place. Just talk.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.236
What's going on?

44:17.321 --> 44:18.655
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

44:18.739 --> 44:20.865
when you think about home?

44:20.949 --> 44:24.661
I just wish I had my own TV,
so I could watch it in my room.

44:25.412 --> 44:28.956
If I had my own TV,
I wouldn't have to watch it with my mother.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.834
And what's it like,
watching TV with your mother?

44:31.919 --> 44:34.671
You enjoy watching TV with your mother?

44:34.755 --> 44:39.759
I need to know about your home life.
I need to know what it's like where you live.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.887
My mother's like a whale on the couch.

44:42.971 --> 44:46.974
She say I eat all the time,
but she always making me eat.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.268
Then she call me a fat mess.

44:49.353 --> 44:52.480
She say the apartment
is little 'cause of me.

44:52.564 --> 44:55.358
Only time she ever leaves
is to play her numbers.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.361
I feel like I could just sit in the house
with her every day,

44:58.445 --> 44:59.862
the shades drawn,

44:59.947 --> 45:04.158
watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.286
Can you help out with that?

45:08.497 --> 45:11.165
Can we talk about something else now?

45:17.464 --> 45:19.382
How about your firstborn?

45:19.466 --> 45:20.800
Mongo?

45:22.636 --> 45:24.721
Mongo is her... Is that...

45:25.389 --> 45:28.057
Mongo. That's short for "mongoloid. "

45:28.934 --> 45:33.271
Is that what you call her? Or that's...
What is that? A nickname?

45:33.981 --> 45:35.898
She got Down's syndrome.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.074
How you doing, Precious?

45:45.159 --> 45:47.744
My grandmother Toosie

45:47.828 --> 45:52.165
on days when the social worker come,
so it look like she live with us.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.710
Answer the fucking door.

45:57.379 --> 45:59.630
Do you see what you did? God damn it.

45:59.715 --> 46:03.009
Then my mother gets money
and the food stamps for me and Mongo.

46:03.093 --> 46:04.510
Who is it?

46:05.095 --> 46:06.721
It痴 Ms. Turner.

46:07.765 --> 46:08.806
Social worker's here.

46:08.891 --> 46:12.602
Why didn't you tell me that bitch

46:12.686 --> 46:15.354

46:15.439 --> 46:16.773

46:21.528 --> 46:23.362

46:39.671 --> 46:42.924
- Get off of me.

47:01.068 --> 47:04.070

47:04.905 --> 47:07.448

47:34.685 --> 47:38.187
You know, they'll call me back.
They'll get back to me.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.692
When did you go looking for the job?

47:42.776 --> 47:46.946

47:47.030 --> 47:50.741
And they all said the same thing,

49:09.029 --> 49:10.571
Then you go and pick it up

49:10.656 --> 49:13.866
You're so fucking stupid.

You know what?
Let's talk about your father.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.880
Tell me about your relationship with him.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.424

49:47.150 --> 49:49.151

- You didn't hear shit.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.029

- I ain't say nothing. I ain't say shit like it.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.948

49:54.032 --> 49:55.616

Well, I値l see you next time, then.
Or maybe you'll see someone else.

But you're gonna have to talk to somebody
if you want your check, sweetie.

50:18.306 --> 50:20.349

50:23.186 --> 50:26.522
They come at night.
They tell me I知 one of them.

50:27.899 --> 50:31.027
They say, "Precious, you belong with us. "

50:33.447 --> 50:35.948
And then they go downstairs
through the floor.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.868
The people that live under us,
they is vampires,

50:38.952 --> 50:41.287
so that's where they should go.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.998
They be so nasty, though,

50:44.082 --> 50:46.459
leaving their dirty tampons and shit
in the garbage.

50:46.543 --> 50:48.961
Don't even offer to take it out.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.589
They got no fucking home training.

50:54.634 --> 50:58.387
I been going to the doctor, too. It痴 nice.

50:59.806 --> 51:04.143
Ms. Rain fall out when she found out
I ain't never been to no doctor before.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.690
Don't know how I had my first baby
on the kitchen floor

51:09.775 --> 51:12.693
with my momma kicking me
upside my head.

51:15.363 --> 51:16.739
Them the kind of things

51:16.823 --> 51:19.658
when you say,
say whatever come to my mind?

51:24.206 --> 51:26.957
That's the end of them welfare checks.

51:27.042 --> 51:31.087
I just couldn't lie no more.
I shouldn't have said none of that.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.425
Momma gonna kill me.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.852
Motherfuckers!

51:50.482 --> 51:52.108
Are we done?

51:52.192 --> 51:53.943
I知 not doing this with you today.

51:54.027 --> 51:56.695
At night, we went out on a field trip.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.786
These girls is crazy.

52:04.204 --> 52:07.540
Ain't nobody ever grabbed my hand
like that before.

52:24.266 --> 52:26.725
...as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination

52:26.810 --> 52:29.812
for the presidency
of the United States of America.

52:30.480 --> 52:34.233
...and by having destroyed it,
now we don't know...

52:36.611 --> 52:41.574
...and the testimony you're about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth...

52:41.658 --> 52:43.534
I still have a dream.

52:45.370 --> 52:48.998
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

52:50.250 --> 52:54.003
I have a dream that one day

52:55.505 --> 53:00.676
this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of...

53:00.760 --> 53:02.887
I'm gonna teach my baby all of this.

53:02.971 --> 53:06.015
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

53:06.099 --> 53:08.184
"that all men are created equal. "

53:08.268 --> 53:10.519
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

53:10.604 --> 53:11.687
You mean, write a whole new one?

53:11.771 --> 53:14.648
No, girl, if I need to 
explain myself to you...

53:14.733 --> 53:16.483
- You'll figure it out.
- You think that I知 stupid?

53:16.568 --> 53:19.612
Oh, my God. That I believe in you?

53:21.615 --> 53:23.157
That I think you're incredible?

53:23.241 --> 53:24.950
Yes, but I don't know what to do.

53:25.035 --> 53:28.078
All right, pull it together. Okay.
Who's next?

53:29.039 --> 53:30.372
I'm happy to be writing.

53:30.457 --> 53:33.459
- Go ahead, Rhonda.
- I'm happy to be in school, too.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.879
Ms. Rain say we gonna write
every day in our notebook.

53:36.963 --> 53:38.923
She gonna write back to us every day, too.

53:39.007 --> 53:42.801
"Yesterday I went to church for
the first time since I come to this country.

53:42.886 --> 53:44.178
"I got all the way to Brooklyn.

53:44.262 --> 53:47.056
"The church was up the block and around
the corner upon the 3 train.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.807
"The preacher preached
two and a half hours

53:48.892 --> 53:51.393
- "about Jehovah.
- Rhonda! Rhonda!

53:51.478 --> 53:54.897
"And how Lord Jesus, Son of God, Messiah,
Jehovah delivers. "

53:54.981 --> 53:56.982
Is that a fairytale?

53:58.526 --> 53:59.860
Sit down.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.237
Did anybody do this assignment?

54:01.321 --> 54:03.822
Momma say this school ain't shit.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.367
She say you can't learn nothing
writing in no book.

54:06.451 --> 54:11.664
- This is a fairytale called "Enchanted. "
- She wrong about that. I is learning.

54:14.417 --> 54:17.878
"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

54:18.296 --> 54:22.424
"there lived a beautiful princess
named Joann-a.

54:23.009 --> 54:27.304
"She was very, very fly and extra, 
extra tall,

54:27.889 --> 54:31.392
"and every single boy loved her,
big and small.

54:32.185 --> 54:36.272
"Except for one idiot boy
who was so stupid and dumb.

54:36.356 --> 54:40.567
"And out of all the cute boys who loved her,
he was the cutest one. "

54:41.695 --> 54:44.989
- That's all I got so far.
- That's a good beginning.

54:45.073 --> 54:48.617
Thinking about little Mongo, too. 
I miss her.

54:48.994 --> 54:50.452
That's how you start a fairytale.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.830
I'm happy my baby coming up.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.793
I'm gonna read to this baby, too,
and hang colors on its wall.

54:58.712 --> 55:01.630
Listen, baby. Mother not dumb.

55:01.715 --> 55:04.008
Mother love you. Listen.

55:04.509 --> 55:08.178
"Once upon a time,
there was a magical princess

55:08.263 --> 55:11.432
"who lived in a magical bubble
under the sea.

55:11.975 --> 55:14.059
"And she was from land. "

55:29.284 --> 55:30.951
Stop screaming.

55:51.931 --> 55:55.768
His name's Abdul Jamal Lewis Jones.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.605
He healthy. His mother love him.

56:15.747 --> 56:17.956
The food in this hospital's nasty.

56:18.625 --> 56:19.750
It痴 not from here.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.418
Where it from?

56:21.503 --> 56:24.046
A little shop by my house where

56:24.130 --> 56:26.548
I get my organic food,
so I don't have to eat that

56:26.633 --> 56:29.218
nasty mystery-meat stuff
they got downstairs.

56:29.302 --> 56:32.304
Can you bring me something?
I don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.598
First of all, I don't eat McDonald's.

56:34.682 --> 56:37.351
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.

56:37.435 --> 56:38.477
It痴 not healthy.

56:38.561 --> 56:40.771
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?

56:40.855 --> 56:43.482
We like McDonald's, too, over here.

56:43.566 --> 56:45.067
I don't like no damn McDonald's.

56:45.151 --> 56:48.237
I want some of that organic shit
like you got.

56:48.655 --> 56:50.114
Well, I tell you what,

56:50.198 --> 56:52.741
when you get up out of here,
you go with all your little friends,

56:52.826 --> 56:53.784
and you go to McDonald's,

56:53.868 --> 56:55.744
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.288
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.

56:58.373 --> 57:00.082
Are you a doctor?

57:01.167 --> 57:03.127
- Are you her doctor?
- Am I a doctor?

57:03.211 --> 57:05.879
- Yeah.
- I am a nurse's aide.

57:05.964 --> 57:07.756
Nurse John-John.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.508
Oh, that's funny?

57:10.009 --> 57:11.760
Well, you're a man.

57:12.512 --> 57:15.180
- You've never seen a male nurse?
- No.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.433
Not looking like you do.

57:18.226 --> 57:22.354
I am a male nurse.
I am Nurse John McFadden.

57:22.439 --> 57:25.023
So was you up in the room
when she popped the baby out?

57:25.108 --> 57:26.150
You was like, all up in between her...

57:26.234 --> 57:28.277
Joann, don't be nasty!

57:28.361 --> 57:29.945
How was it? Was he screaming?

57:30.029 --> 57:31.113
It hurt.

57:31.197 --> 57:32.781
Tough gal like you had to scream?

57:32.866 --> 57:37.119
Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
It hurt. And it burned.

57:37.203 --> 57:38.454
- Are you married?
- Shut up!

57:38.538 --> 57:40.205
You got a girlfriend?

57:40.290 --> 57:42.708
- Why you asking? He don't want you.
- How would you know?

57:42.792 --> 57:44.460
Why don't you stop being a ho
for 10 minutes?

57:44.544 --> 57:45.711
What's wrong with these people?

57:45.795 --> 57:47.171
You don't want her, right?

57:47.255 --> 57:50.048
I wish I was a cantaloupe in that cup.

57:50.133 --> 57:51.633
So he could eat you?

57:51.718 --> 57:55.345
Okay, no. I gotta go. I gotta go.

57:55.763 --> 57:58.557
No, that's all right. That's all right.

58:01.811 --> 58:03.770
Can I get a kiss, too, Nurse John?

58:03.855 --> 58:06.607
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Bye, Nurse John.

58:06.691 --> 58:09.568
- Bye!
- Good night, Nurse John-John!

58:10.987 --> 58:13.280
Precious and John-John

58:13.364 --> 58:15.324
Sitting in a tree

58:15.408 --> 58:19.203
- F-U-C-K-I-N-G
- Shut up! Y'all are nasty.

58:22.916 --> 58:25.584
You think he's spending the night
up in here?

58:27.754 --> 58:30.964
Now she gonna write
about Nurse John in her book!

58:32.258 --> 58:33.926
"Dear Ms. Rain,

58:34.427 --> 58:37.596
"All the years I sit in class,
 I never learned.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.766
"Now I got a baby again by my father.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.144
"I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls.

58:44.229 --> 58:47.397
"Then I'll feel right
that I have to quit school.

58:47.482 --> 58:50.984
"I love my baby, but I want school, too.

58:51.069 --> 58:53.445
"Social worker ask me
if I wanna give little Mongo

58:53.530 --> 58:57.074
"and Abdul up for adoption.
I could kill her.

58:57.492 --> 59:01.245
"She never helped before.
Now she wanna take my kids away?

59:01.955 --> 59:05.207
"If she takes Abdul,
I won't have nothing no more. "

59:05.291 --> 59:07.251
"Dear Precious,

59:07.335 --> 59:10.629
"I think your first responsibility
has to be to yourself.

59:10.838 --> 59:13.382
"If you keep Abdul, you might have nothing.

59:13.466 --> 59:15.926
"You're learning to read and write.
That's everything.

59:16.010 --> 59:18.679
"You come back to school
when you get out of the hospital.

59:18.763 --> 59:19.888
"You're only 17."

59:19.973 --> 59:22.391
This looks like a big-ass condom.

59:24.269 --> 59:26.353
Use that for Nurse John.

59:26.854 --> 59:29.022
Not looking like that.
Your hair looks a mess.

59:29.107 --> 59:31.817
- I知 giving you banjee.
- Shut up!

59:31.901 --> 59:33.402
I got your journal.

59:33.486 --> 59:34.987
Thank you.

59:40.243 --> 59:41.785
What's wrong?

59:41.869 --> 59:43.203
Nothing.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.871
Are you sure?

59:44.956 --> 59:45.998
Yeah, I知 sure.

59:46.082 --> 59:50.502
All right. I知 bored. 
I知 about to leave. Bye.

59:52.171 --> 59:53.839
Bye, Ms. Toosie.

59:54.340 --> 59:55.924
You got a nasty-ass mouth.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.093
You got a nasty-ass hat.

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:03.307
That's what's wrong,
you hanging out with bitches like that.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:04.975
Here's your baby.

01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:07.436
It痴 probably the last time
you're gonna ever see him.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.937
Grandmother come and visit and say,

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.607
"Only a dog would drop a baby
and walk off. "

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.983
Not even a dog.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.694
Say later, "Not even a dog. "

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.864
I知 proud of you.
Ain't nothing like your mother.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:22.284
"Where was your grandmother
when your father was abusing you?

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:24.453
"Where is little Mongo now?

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.956
"What is going to be the best thing for you
in this situation?"

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.334
"Ms. Rain, you ask too many questions.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.961
"Sometimes I wish I could stop breathing.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.422
"I just wanna be a good mother. "

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.634
"Being a good mother might mean
letting Abdul be raised

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:42.387
"by someone who's better able than you
to meet his needs. "

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:46.600
"Ms. Rain, I is the best
to meet my child's needs. "

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.819
"Who's gonna help you?

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:00.656
"How will you support yourself?

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:04.910
"How will you keep learning
to read and write?"

01:01:05.953 --> 01:01:08.038
"The welfare helped Momma. "

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:12.417
"You look and see
how much welfare has helped your mom.

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.338
"You could get your GED,

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:19.091
"and go to college.
You can do anything, Precious. "

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:42.632
You back?

01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:44.593
What's his name?

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.678
Can I hold it?

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.077
Hey, Precious.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.082
Hey.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.254
You had the baby?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.130
A boy.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.634
Where you been all this time?

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.934
Let me see him.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:24.901
Can I hold him?

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.423
He look like his daddy.

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:53.471
He named Abdul.

01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:58.351
Put all this shit down
and go get me something to drink.

01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:18.288
You bitch!

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.082
- You fucking bitch!
- You crazy, Momma?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.668
Am I crazy? Bitch, if I was to...

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.379
You ruined my fucking life!

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.132
You done took my man,
you had those fucking babies,

01:05:29.216 --> 01:05:30.467
and you got me put off the welfare

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:32.844
for running your goddamned
stupid-ass mouth!

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:36.806
I ain't stupid and I didn't take your man.
Your husband raped me!

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:38.391
Didn't no-fucking-body rape you!

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.810
Bitch, don't you put
your fucking hands on me!

01:06:01.415 --> 01:06:03.708
Mary, leave that girl alone!

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:44.249
Can I see the baby now?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.966
B... C... D...

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:04.305
E... F... G... H...

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.684
I... J... K...

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.317
I知 tired of shopping.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.361
Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.

01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:20.321
They don't...

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.876
I知 calling the cops.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.591
Tell me what you see back there.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:57.483
I could tell by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeless no more.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.611
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.279
I値l hold.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.949
I feel bad for her.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.786
She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.

01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:11.664
What's going on?

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:12.916
But she all I could think of.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.460
Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.712
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:19.464
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.674
Ms. Rain, I can't stay. I知 serious.
I've tried to talk...

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:24.344
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and I知 not dealing with this right now.

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:26.763
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.

01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:29.307
Quick. And bring back my change.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:33.102
Sixteen years old. A three-day-old infant.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.855
The baby not bleeding.
I think this is Precious' blood.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.816
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:42.612
We'll find you a place to live.

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:47.533
Joann, you're late.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:49.827
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:52.288
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.499
so I am the teacher today.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.459
Okay. Why?

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.670
- Where's Precious?
- Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.172
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.674
What's the baby doing here?

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.467
- Joann's gonna rap for you.
- Let me see.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.970
She all right. She's doing good.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.640
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?

01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:13.476
- Joann, what's so funny?
- For real. What happened?

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.978
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.145
You know what your problem is, Joann?

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.022
That you can't take anything
serious enough.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.525
- Jermaine, me expect better from you.
- Okay, Rhonda.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:23.152
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.114
Queens.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.201
Let me call you back.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.577
Just tell me what happened!

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:32.996
No, it's not funny.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.915
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.792
I got a West Indian friend
who's a Council member.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.003
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:43.381
I found a lesson plan in our notebooks.
We're gonna...

01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:46.634
Clareece Jones.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:49.012
Hey, Ms. Lisa. How you been?

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:51.055
I don't know.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.059
I went to see that movie, Barfly, last night.
Piece of shit.

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:59.188
- I知 sorry.
- It痴 on my desk. Can you hold?

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.566
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.192
This baby stink.

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.570
Well, we don't have a Pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:08.323
- I am sitting.
- In your seat, please.

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.491
The first thing

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:16.247
is shut the bumba-ros-clot...

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:19.625
Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.336
She don't even know how to speak English.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.462
Let Rhonda take over.

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:26.174
- Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
- What the fuck is a "ros clot"?

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.176
Yeah, Brenda, you there?

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.845
The last four of the Social are...

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:33.514
2-4-2-1.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.725
- Rita?
- I just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius. "

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:38.686
- Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"?
- It痴 A-Q-U-A-R-I-U-S.

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:39.979
Can you spell "boy" then?

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.314
Can you spell "slut" then?

01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:43.024
Let's explore that.

01:12:43.108 --> 01:12:46.444
You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo,
I値l give you the first letter.

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.654
Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then?

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.782
Great, thank you.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.869
Can you please use "slut" in a sentence?

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.329
Consuelo is a slut...

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:59.207
- You the one who's the ho up in here...
- Joann is not a slut.

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:01.667
Perfect. You get a gold star.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.213
But you know she likes that.

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:07.590
Well, she's just insecure.

01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:09.300
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:13.388
- That chicken was good.
- Really good. Did you have enough?

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.390
There ain't more, is there?

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:17.141
- Is there more?
- Yeah.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.769
Maybe later. Not now.

01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:21.813
I don't want you to think I知 greedy.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.232
You're not greedy.
If you're hungry, let's get you some more.

01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:27.485
I guess I kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:28.820
No, you don't.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.780
- Blu, is that you?
- Not always.

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.949
What are you doing here?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.077
I live here. Why didn't you tell me?

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.955
- Hey, sweetie.
- Is this... Is this...

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.750
This is Katherine, Precious.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.877
- Are you okay?
- It痴 so nice to meet you, finally.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:48.381
Oh, my God. These straight-up lesbians.

01:13:48.465 --> 01:13:52.051
- This is Abdul.
- He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.429
Precious, can I hold him?

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.264
You know how to?

01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:58.349
They still nice enough
to let us stay in their home

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.768
until I get situated, though.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:04.939
- He's heavy. Oh, my God!
- You wanna hold him?

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:07.525
I guess this is how the peoples
on TV feel at Christmastime.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:10.194
- Don't drop him.
- Come on. I only work with children.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.320
You know how you are. I saw you...

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.448
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.116
They're so nice to me and Abdul.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.285
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
- Please.

01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:19.078
Oh, Abdul.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.207
Merry Christmas, Precious.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.168
Thank you.

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.586
Why peoples that barely know me

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:30.006
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.049
I felt warm.

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:33.593
- What?
- I知 just...

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.846
I知 just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.097
They're fine.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.183
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:42.685
I know that's why
she ain't letting me stay with her.

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:44.687
If Ronald McDonald were running things...

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:47.565
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:50.693
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.

01:14:50.777 --> 01:14:53.404
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.739
Just write the book.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:58.075
- Well, who's gonna read it?
- Nobody, if you don't write it.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.704
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:05.041
Is that right?
What do you write about, Precious?

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.084
Stuff.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.588
My life. Abdul.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.176
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.094
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.263
so that her point could be
more easily understood.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.348
Yes.

01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.934
They talk like TV channels I don't watch.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.393
My Uncle Clayton.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:27.939
I'm glad Abdul here to listen in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.440
Before he got saved,

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.193
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:34.320
I don't understand a word they're saying.

01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:35.988
You understand?

01:15:39.576 --> 01:15:41.035
Y'all be watching Oprah?

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:44.038
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time I get home from work.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:47.250
- I watch it.
- Momma say homos is bad peoples.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.378
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.

01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:52.755
And what do that make you?

01:15:52.839 --> 01:15:56.968
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
all them years and never learn nothing.

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.929
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peoples in Harlem.

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:02.014
- ... that I have ever seen. Tell her!
- That doesn't work.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.684
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:07.144
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chalk in my hand,

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.689
made me queen of the ABC's.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.569
After I settled at the halfway house,

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:17.071
I worked my hardest
to memorize letter sounds,

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:20.157
writing in the journal,
and reading smaller and fatter books.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:23.494
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a literacy award

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.329
and a check for progress.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.500
One, two, three.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.335
The party is on.

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.004
Go, Joann!

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.384
Let me see what you got!

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:43.556
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.350
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:47.977
Precious.

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:52.607
What's up?

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.609
What's that?

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:56.861
What does it look like?

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.863
Plastic stupid apple.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:03.701
A little something for you.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.495
- Is there more money in it?
- You're so greedy.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.332
Yo, who's that?

01:17:12.252 --> 01:17:13.502
What?

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:18.382
- What?
- Come on.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.344
Precious, where are you taking me?

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:26.474
What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.

01:17:26.558 --> 01:17:28.100
Yeah...

01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:34.398
My mom called last night.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:40.363
And we don't really have a relationship.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:43.658
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with...

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:47.495
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples.

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:50.665
I think maybe some of them was in tunnels,

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.459
and in that tunnel,
maybe the only light they had

01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:55.086
was inside of them.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:58.422
Then I thought about how strong
you've had to be.

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:04.762
And then,
even long after they escaped that tunnel...

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.933
- I値l help you clean up.
- Okay.

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:12.603
...they still be shining for everybody else.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.859
That's Ms. Rain to me.

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:23.364
"Award for Outstanding Achievement. "

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:27.076
In a book I read,
this lady escaped to a halfway house.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.369
And when she was there,

01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:31.372
she asked the people there
what a halfway house was.

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:35.793
They told her it was halfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.795
That's kind of nice.

01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:42.550
That also mean I can't stay here forever.

01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:44.802
There's still a way to go.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:48.472
It'd be something to get my own apartment.

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:52.810
Abdul nine months and almost walking.
He's smart, too.

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:56.564
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:59.692
He's barely talking,
but he's already counting.

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:02.486
Momma, Daddy,

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:07.658
IS 111,444 Lenox all seem
like some old, bad dream.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:13.831
I wish I could've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:19.420
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.

01:19:21.506 --> 01:19:22.590
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:24.884
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.

01:19:24.968 --> 01:19:26.719
- Who is it?
- I didn't ask who it was.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.012
You want me to watch the baby?

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.973
No, I gotta go down and get him anyway.

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.051
Your daddy dead.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.429
That's all?

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.394
He had that AIDS virus.

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.161
There you go, dreaming again!

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.914
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.458
Did you hear what I said?

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:45.840
You got it?

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.717
Got what?

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.761
- The AIDS virus.
- No.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.430
How do you know?

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:56.392
We never did it up in the ass, so I know.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:03.232
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.653
You coming home?

01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:26.130
Yo, Precious!

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:47.776
Rita, what do I mean when I say the author

01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:52.531
describes her protagonist's circumstances
as "unrelenting"?

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:55.868
I don't know. I don't know.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:01.832
It痴 like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.376
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:07.087
and she no stop, she keep on going.

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:09.506
Relentless-un.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.687
I値l see you tonight. Bye.

01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:55.279
Come with me.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.115
Precious?

01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.410
Excuse me?

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.456
Nurse say I知 HIV positive.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:14.631
I ain't got nothing to write today.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:18.135
Is your baby okay?

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:22.556
He all right.
I just got to stop breastfeeding him.

01:24:26.269 --> 01:24:28.437
Remember, you once told me

01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:31.815
you never really got to tell your story.

01:24:33.276 --> 01:24:35.319
- Write.
- Fuck you!

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.822
You know nothing
of what I致e been through.

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:42.326
I ain't never had no boyfriend.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:47.581
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:51.543
How he gonna do that?
It would fucking be illegal!

01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:09.019
Write.

01:25:11.147 --> 01:25:13.690
I知 tired, Ms. Rain.

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:17.736
If not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:19.613
Nobody loves me.

01:25:19.697 --> 01:25:21.949
People do love you, Precious.

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:24.868
Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:28.080
Love ain't done nothing for me.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.543
Love beat me, raped me,

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:37.965
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.217
Make me sick.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.638
That wasn't love, Precious.

01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:48.559
Your baby loves you.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.313
I love you.

01:26:00.613 --> 01:26:01.864
Write.

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:12.749
What are you thinking?

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:19.131
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:23.552
I didn't, did I?

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:26.847
Really, I知 here to help you.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:30.100
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:32.811
You're right.

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:35.439
We could talk about your daddy instead.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.358
We could talk about my mother, my father,

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:42.821
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.

01:26:43.489 --> 01:26:44.990
You don't even like me.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:48.118
Have we not been in this room together

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:51.455
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:54.541
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.084
I can't speak for you.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:27:00.631
I can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:03.133
So, are you Italian, or...

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.509
What color are you, anyway?

01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:06.678
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.972
What color do you think I am?

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:14.269
No, I'd like to know.
What color do you think I am?

01:27:15.104 --> 01:27:16.813
My throat is dry.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.399
Your throat is dry?

01:27:19.817 --> 01:27:21.526
It痴 really hot in here.

01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:23.695
It is kind of hot in here.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:27.115
I知 gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.326
Soda sounds fine.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.827
All right.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:02.859
Thank you.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.903
No problem.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.827
So, I have to talk to you about your mother,

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.705
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:17.541
but she says she wants to see you

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:22.254
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.799
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:27.467
What did you tell her?

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:30.387
I said I had to speak to you about it.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:34.433
It痴 up to you.

01:28:34.517 --> 01:28:37.477
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:41.523
Ms. Weiss said in that file I got HIV.

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:44.026
She said I was supposed to die from it.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.153
I ain't worried about dying.

01:28:46.237 --> 01:28:50.198
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.702
I was just writing, like, about...

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.496
I wanna open up this clinic

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:59.791
about, like, mothers and their children.

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:03.670
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:07.424
I always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.385
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if I did that,

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.137
and my children, too.

01:29:12.221 --> 01:29:15.932
I want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:21.605
- That's always what I wanted to do, so...
- That's good. That's really nice.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:29.654
I don't really want to read the whole thing,
I kind of just wanna say what it's about.

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:34.534
Okay, the counselors
at Advancement House,

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:38.872
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:40.707
But it's not really about them.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:42.876
They're trying to get me to do workfare.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.337
- They want me to be a home attendant.
- How do you know?

01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:47.714
Because I stole my file and I read it.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.716
All they want me to do is work.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:53.053
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.

01:29:53.137 --> 01:29:54.554
What kind of sense that make,

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:57.557
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.268
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:03.438
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:05.023
Rhonda used to home attend.

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:08.110
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:11.530
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.

01:30:11.614 --> 01:30:13.657
She'd be on call, right?

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:18.286
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:20.997
That equal out to $50.96.

01:30:21.999 --> 01:30:23.417
But that's not a whole lot of money,

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:26.628
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.

01:30:26.712 --> 01:30:31.425
So, $50.96 divided by 24

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:35.429
is $2.12 an hour. 
That's not a lot of money.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:39.891
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.810
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.

01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:44.604
- You don't want to do that shit.
- Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:47.732
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:51.695
I壇 only see Abdul on Sunday.
Plus, I壇 have to leave class.

01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:55.323
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:58.535
Plus, I知 gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.120
It痴 "incest. "

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:05.041
- That ain't what I said?
- No, you said "insect. "

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.918
What's the difference?

01:31:07.003 --> 01:31:08.795
Well, one's where your family molests you,

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.548
the other's like a roach or bugs.

01:31:14.218 --> 01:31:16.845
- So, you a scientist now?
- I知 just saying.

01:31:16.929 --> 01:31:19.723
No, that's cool. Thank you. Thank you.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:29.483
It was hard telling them strangers there
what my father did.

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:31.568
Sometimes it felt good.

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:41.036
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.

01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:44.998
I wrote that I be real skinny,

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.959
with light skin and long hair.

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.087
Loretha Holloway?

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:53.423
Go on back there.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.342
She read it and said 
I知 beautiful like I am.

01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:58.929
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:03.058
Just shut up and sit there, then.

01:32:03.142 --> 01:32:06.520
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:08.063
But somehow,

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:12.442
right now... And I don't know why, but...

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:16.321
I think she right.

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:23.787
Here.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:34.089
Clareece Jones?

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:42.055
I think she right.

01:32:47.311 --> 01:32:49.396
Okay, Mrs. Johnston,
let's talk about the abuse.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.690
There were no drugs in my house.

01:32:51.774 --> 01:32:53.733
I didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.485
Precious knew I would whup her ass

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.070
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.

01:32:57.154 --> 01:32:59.531
You know what I知 talking about.

01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:05.829
I知 referring to specific
sexual and physical acts

01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:08.164
involving Precious.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:10.834
Why you ain't say that?

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:13.169
Yes, that.

01:33:15.214 --> 01:33:17.132
What do you wanna know?

01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:19.217
According to Precious' files,

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:23.346
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:27.684
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:35.984
- Yeah.
- This is accurate?

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:40.196
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:43.783
I need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:47.787
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:51.374
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.585
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:55.003
but I知 just telling you.

01:33:55.087 --> 01:33:57.839
You said I致e been calling here
and I致e been wanting to see

01:33:57.923 --> 01:33:59.382
Precious and my grandson.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:03.970
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:07.098
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.975
and I done told her that.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.687
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:15.482
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:20.278
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:25.742
The summertime.
She was born in the summertime.

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.827
Remember? Remember that?

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.080
I was born in November.

01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:32.123
November.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.460
Yeah, that's right.

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:38.630
My Scorpio child.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.258
You know...

01:34:42.968 --> 01:34:47.013
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:52.769
And, I知 not saying that they lie.
I知 not saying that.

01:34:53.312 --> 01:34:55.647
But you just gotta watch them.

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:03.405
Can we talk about the actual acts

01:35:03.489 --> 01:35:06.199
of physical and sexual abuse

01:35:06.283 --> 01:35:08.743
that occurred in your household?

01:35:09.328 --> 01:35:10.870
When it first began,

01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:13.957
where it happened
and how did you respond?

01:35:20.339 --> 01:35:22.507
Precious was a little girl.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:26.970
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:32.809
She was three.

01:35:34.770 --> 01:35:38.231
And I had been giving her the bottle

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:42.610
and I was giving Carl the tittie

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:47.031
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:51.494
but not from her, but because Carl was...

01:35:52.663 --> 01:35:54.581
Because Carl was sucking on them

01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:58.501
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:04.007
And I thought that that was for hygiene.

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:07.677
I did what my mother told me

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:12.140
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what I did.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.268
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me...

01:36:15.352 --> 01:36:18.188
I知 not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:20.690
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.193
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.821
You got this bitch looking at me
like I知 some kind of fucking monster.

01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.823
We don't talk like this in my office, okay?

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:32.452
I didn't want her sucking behind him,
because that was nasty.

01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:36.247
And things that he was...
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

01:36:41.879 --> 01:36:45.507
I had a man, and I have a child

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:51.137
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

01:36:52.807 --> 01:36:57.811
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:02.232
Because I would lay my baby.

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:06.945
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

01:37:08.697 --> 01:37:10.865
and it was pink

01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:14.619
and it had this little white writing on it

01:37:14.703 --> 01:37:18.832
and it had her name,
because she was precious.

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:22.085
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:25.547
and Carl would be laying on the other side

01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:30.844
and then we would...
We would start doing it

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:33.054
and he reached over

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.350
and he touched my baby.

01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:38.977
And I asked him,

01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:42.355
I said, "Carl, what are you doing?"

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:44.858
And he told me to shut...

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:47.944
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:51.281
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.

01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:55.118
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.953
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

01:37:57.037 --> 01:37:58.997
I did not want him to abuse my daughter.

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:00.582
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:02.542
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.

01:38:02.626 --> 01:38:04.544
I wanted him to make love to me.

01:38:04.628 --> 01:38:07.630
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:10.633
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

01:38:11.927 --> 01:38:14.220
And that's why I hated her.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:17.307
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:20.226
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.563
was fucking my baby.

01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:27.275
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

01:38:27.818 --> 01:38:28.943
So, whose fault was it, then?

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:32.196
It痴 this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:33.865
and she didn't say nothing.

01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:35.950
She didn't scream. She didn't do nothing.

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:39.579
So, those things she told you I did to her,

01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:42.832
who else was gonna love me?

01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:49.464
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

01:38:49.548 --> 01:38:53.593
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

01:38:53.677 --> 01:38:57.347
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.974
And she made him go away, so...

01:39:00.726 --> 01:39:04.228
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:08.358
about who you think I am,
and why I did it, all of that.

01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:11.903
Because I didn't have nobody.

01:39:20.704 --> 01:39:23.873
The people from

01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:27.543
Each One Teach One,

01:39:28.253 --> 01:39:31.214
they had... They called me

01:39:34.176 --> 01:39:37.261
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:38.846
In fact, you know what, I got...

01:39:38.931 --> 01:39:40.515
Wait a minute.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.959
I知 sorry.

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:12.338
I知 sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:16.634
I don't need no more money. Please.
I知 so sorry.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.721
I took that TABE test again.

01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:22.056
And what happened?

01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:23.808
I scored a 7.8.

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:27.437
Last time it was 2.8.

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:31.190
According to that test,

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.985
I知 reading at
a seventh- and eighth-grade level.

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.448
Next year, high school. After that, college.

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:46.789
Well, I like you, too.

01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:51.169
But you can't handle me.

01:40:52.963 --> 01:40:55.298
You can't handle none of this.

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:06.642
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.479
Not even after all the things you did.

01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:14.484
Maybe I was too stupid, or
maybe I just didn't want to.

01:41:16.945 --> 01:41:19.280
You ain't gonna see me no more.

01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:24.160
Bye!

01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.749
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:32.251
Please, God,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:35.213
Ms. Weiss,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

01:41:35.297 --> 01:41:37.090
I would say to him, I would say...

01:41:37.174 --> 01:41:40.426
"Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?"

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.104
Can you go get her back?

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:53.773
You can do that,
because that's what you do.

01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:55.691
That's what you do.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.821
I need you to go
and I need you to get my baby back.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:03.533
You told me that I could come in here
and you could get...

01:42:03.992 --> 01:42:05.451
You could get Precious to say...

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:08.037
Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?

01:42:09.305 --> 01:42:15.380
