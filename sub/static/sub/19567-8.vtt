WEBVTT

00:00.453 --> 00:01.679
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:01.694 --> 00:03.206
I really think we should
do something with this.

00:03.230 --> 00:04.787
That side of yourself is fearless,

00:04.812 --> 00:06.465
and I find that very attractive.

00:06.533 --> 00:09.401
I have to go somehow
convince McPherson not to sell

00:09.470 --> 00:10.954
the story Kyle's been dying to direct.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.137
What if you don't?

00:12.206 --> 00:13.672
But my God! I get
to meet Charlotte Banks!

00:13.696 --> 00:15.166
- Yes!
- And her producing partner

00:15.191 --> 00:16.296
saw me in the play,

00:16.321 --> 00:17.810
and now I'm gonna be reading with her.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.945
- That's amazing.
- My God!

00:20.013 --> 00:22.881
She's getting totally sucked
in and it needs to stop,

00:22.950 --> 00:24.367
and that was the whole
point of the photos.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.368
What? You're the one
who leaked the photos?

00:26.393 --> 00:28.251
Kyle West is really just a product

00:28.276 --> 00:29.921
of the Institute of the Higher Mind.

00:29.990 --> 00:30.990
This is sick, Hope.

00:31.058 --> 00:32.858
I've taken the workshop myself.

00:32.926 --> 00:35.010
- What?
- Terence, this is Shaun.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.135
- Megan's friend.
- Yeah.

00:37.431 --> 00:39.464
How hard did you fight for me?

00:39.533 --> 00:42.104
How hard did you try to make
a different deal with her?

00:42.129 --> 00:43.625
Don't come near me again.

00:50.444 --> 00:52.773
So all the data for
the system goes where?

00:52.798 --> 00:55.078
- Put on some server operated by you?
- Correct.

00:55.103 --> 00:56.939
Okay, and how secure is that?

00:56.984 --> 00:59.024
Well, if you're asking if
our servers can be hacked,

00:59.052 --> 01:00.685
it's virtually impossible.

01:00.754 --> 01:02.320
Virtually?

01:02.389 --> 01:04.022
Look, I'll be honest with you.

01:04.090 --> 01:06.791
We can give you the best
security system in the world,

01:06.860 --> 01:10.529
and we will, but if
someone is just hell-bent

01:10.597 --> 01:12.497
on getting past it to
invade your privacy,

01:12.566 --> 01:13.698
they'll find a way.

01:13.767 --> 01:15.467
What are we doing this for?

01:15.536 --> 01:17.335
It's a very effective deterrent.

01:17.404 --> 01:20.253
How many stalkers
have you had, Mr. West?

01:20.941 --> 01:22.774
Three... ish.

01:22.843 --> 01:24.242
You need to do something.

01:24.311 --> 01:26.444
Hey, how's it going?

01:26.513 --> 01:28.013
Quinn was just,

01:28.081 --> 01:29.738
walking me through how
this whole thing works.

01:29.762 --> 01:31.349
It's crazy that somebody got in here.

01:31.418 --> 01:32.984
It's really disturbing.

01:33.053 --> 01:34.986
Well, we're installing
motion-detector lights,

01:35.055 --> 01:37.188
there's sensors on
the doors and windows,

01:37.257 --> 01:38.735
and we've got internal-external cameras,

01:38.759 --> 01:39.824
carbon monoxide alarms...

01:39.893 --> 01:41.359
Security cameras inside the house?

01:41.428 --> 01:42.839
Well, if there's a
break-in, you want to know

01:42.863 --> 01:44.262
exactly where the intruder is.

01:44.331 --> 01:46.466
Right, but isn't the point
of all this other stuff

01:46.491 --> 01:48.567
to prevent the break-ins
in the first place?

01:48.635 --> 01:51.870
Sorry, obviously, I want
to do everything we can.

01:51.939 --> 01:54.506
It's just the idea of
cameras makes me feel like

01:54.575 --> 01:57.173
I'm gonna end up on
a sex tape somewhere.

01:58.612 --> 02:00.545
No interior cameras.

02:01.982 --> 02:03.882
Okay.

02:03.951 --> 02:05.383
Thank you.

02:07.254 --> 02:09.167
Okay, I'm off to set.

02:09.356 --> 02:12.208
Zach told me that he's the only
one who checked her references.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.256
This doesn't make you nervous?

02:14.294 --> 02:16.161
It seems to make you nervous.

02:16.229 --> 02:19.097
Okay, what is going on with you?

02:19.166 --> 02:21.333
Kyle's house was broken into.

02:21.401 --> 02:23.068
Now there's some woman
that we don't know

02:23.136 --> 02:24.533
installing a new security system?

02:24.558 --> 02:26.037
Why are you not all over this?

02:26.106 --> 02:27.684
Kyle and I made a
mutual decision to take

02:27.708 --> 02:29.240
a step back from each other.

02:29.309 --> 02:31.719
Okay, what happened? Tell me.

02:32.245 --> 02:34.679
So you can distance
yourself from the fray?

02:34.748 --> 02:36.320
No.

02:36.345 --> 02:39.584
So I can navigate what I'm
sure is an emotional minefield.

02:39.653 --> 02:42.287
He's been wanting independence.
I'm respecting that.

02:42.356 --> 02:43.555
What else happened?

02:43.624 --> 02:46.448
The rest is between him and me.

02:46.827 --> 02:49.661
Look, my job is a lot easier
when he has a clear head,

02:49.730 --> 02:52.063
and this lovers' quarrel
that's between the two of you

02:52.132 --> 02:53.531
does not help me right now.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.876
Well, I'm sorry about that.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.872
Does this conscious uncoupling
extend to the Institute as well?

03:00.941 --> 03:03.241
Look, DeAnn, the sky
is not falling, okay?

03:03.310 --> 03:05.243
I've got plenty of things to catch up on

03:05.312 --> 03:07.846
until Kyle finds his
way back, which he will

03:07.914 --> 03:11.740
as soon as he realizes that he
is not built to do this alone.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.310 --> 03:43.244
- Hello.
- There she is.

03:43.269 --> 03:44.565
- Hello, my love.
- Hey, Charlotte.

03:44.589 --> 03:46.217
Did you get some rest?

03:46.286 --> 03:48.620
I laid down while I
read the sides 100 times.

03:48.689 --> 03:50.188
Does that count?

03:50.257 --> 03:51.756
I might be a little excited.

03:51.825 --> 03:53.491
Well, so am I.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.860
An actor's life for
me, thank you very much.

03:55.929 --> 03:57.777
Hi-diddle-ee-dee.

04:00.183 --> 04:01.633
Pinocchio?

04:01.702 --> 04:05.136
"Hi-diddle-ee-dee, an
actor's life for me"?

04:05.517 --> 04:07.050
Or not.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.076
Megan.

04:11.425 --> 04:14.045
- Lucas. Hi. First AD.
- Hey, Lucas.

04:14.114 --> 04:17.454
- New pages for today.
- New pages?

04:17.478 --> 04:20.051
Reflecting last night's changes.

04:20.076 --> 04:21.736
40 minutes, yeah?

04:21.761 --> 04:22.960
Thanks.

04:24.776 --> 04:27.192
All of the lines are different.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.160
It's a completely different scene.

04:29.229 --> 04:30.628
Did you just get this too?

04:30.697 --> 04:32.097
An hour ago.

04:32.165 --> 04:34.297
You learn to work fast in television.

04:34.322 --> 04:36.968
No, I just put in a lot of
work in the other version.

04:37.037 --> 04:39.204
Well, we'll find the
moments as we go along.

04:39.272 --> 04:42.368
Just focus on learning the lines.

04:42.809 --> 04:44.275
Okay.

04:44.344 --> 04:47.212
And I will have a word with Patrick.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.115
- Patrick?
- The showrunner.

04:50.183 --> 04:52.939
No, it's okay. I'll be fine.

04:52.964 --> 04:56.229
No, it's not okay. You
can't treat your actors

04:56.254 --> 04:58.554
like glorified props.

04:58.623 --> 05:00.301
You think he'd try this
shit with Jeff Daniels?

05:00.325 --> 05:02.591
He'd get his ass handed to him.

05:05.496 --> 05:08.230
So have you given my
weekend idea any thought?

05:08.299 --> 05:10.083
I like the idea...

05:10.108 --> 05:11.867
I just think that time-wise,

05:11.936 --> 05:14.737
I'm not ready for another seminar.

05:14.806 --> 05:16.238
The Anatomy of Leadership,

05:16.307 --> 05:18.808
I thought you... that
you would jump at that.

05:18.876 --> 05:20.478
You're certainly qualified.

05:20.503 --> 05:25.606
It's just hard to integrate
into my actual life.

05:25.883 --> 05:28.718
My friends are resistant,

05:28.786 --> 05:31.654
and the firm is a meat grinder.

05:31.723 --> 05:35.558
There isn't a lot of solid
ground to build my column.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.994
So you want a guarantee
before you make a commitment?

05:39.019 --> 05:42.098
No. I didn't say guarantee.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.633
Well, what's your word then?

05:44.702 --> 05:46.535
The work only works
for you if you extend it

05:46.604 --> 05:48.404
to the other people in your life.

05:50.274 --> 05:53.976
You can't let an unfriendly
room get in the way.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.328
Frame composition and camera movement.

06:02.954 --> 06:04.587
Don't tell me you used to be a director.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.456
No. Just a lot of my clients.

06:07.525 --> 06:09.892
Balance your frame.

06:09.961 --> 06:11.672
Unless you're following
an unstable character,

06:11.696 --> 06:14.163
in which case it's a
great rule to break.

06:14.232 --> 06:15.798
- Speaking of which...
- Sorry.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.510
Just a heads up, it's quarter till.

06:17.535 --> 06:18.956
Thanks, Zach.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.007
Look, I know you don't
want to live in a fortress.

06:25.076 --> 06:27.274
Plenty of my clients feel the same way.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.278
And I know you want to
make your girlfriend happy,

06:29.347 --> 06:31.848
which is usually a good way to go,

06:31.973 --> 06:34.740
but I've reread those police reports,

06:34.817 --> 06:37.985
and this stalker of yours is
not exactly garden-variety.

06:40.508 --> 06:41.741
I know.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.520
Your old security system is old,

06:47.588 --> 06:49.488
but it's not flimsy.

06:49.557 --> 06:52.897
Whoever this person is, they
took the trouble to disarm it

06:52.922 --> 06:54.538
and then didn't steal
anything, which tells me

06:54.562 --> 06:56.999
the ultimate target was you.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.726
Or it was about intimidation and fear.

06:59.751 --> 07:02.739
So whoever did this draws
the line at vandalism.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.037
Is that what you're holding on to?

07:05.106 --> 07:06.984
What do you think would've
happened if you'd been there?

07:07.008 --> 07:09.342
Or your girlfriend?

07:09.410 --> 07:11.177
Look, if you're not
gonna install cameras,

07:11.245 --> 07:13.346
I think you should consider this.

07:17.952 --> 07:21.353
I'm assuming you had weapons
training for your movies.

07:21.378 --> 07:23.790
Sure, but a gun in the house?

07:23.858 --> 07:25.600
Loaded with live ammo?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.135
I don't know.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.600
Gives you a fighting chance if
this person somehow comes back.

07:34.929 --> 07:37.514
You don't have enough
protection without it.

07:38.032 --> 07:40.701
And I wouldn't be doing my
job if I didn't tell you that.

07:44.445 --> 07:46.172
Okay, everybody. Last looks.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.010
- Hey, Megan?
- Yeah.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.279
- I'm Patrick, the showrunner.
- Hey. How's it going?

07:50.348 --> 07:51.981
Good, good. Just, um,

07:52.049 --> 07:53.844
seeing how you're
feeling about the lines.

07:53.868 --> 07:55.901
I know you're learning
them on short notice, so...

07:55.970 --> 07:57.336
Yeah, um...

07:57.404 --> 07:59.605
pretty good, I guess.

07:59.673 --> 08:02.541
Okay, well, we've got
a couple of options here

08:02.610 --> 08:04.476
to give you some relief.

08:04.545 --> 08:06.011
What kind of relief?

08:06.036 --> 08:09.481
Okay, well, option
one would be cue cards.

08:09.550 --> 08:11.483
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

08:11.552 --> 08:13.518
Lucas can hold them right by camera,

08:13.587 --> 08:15.420
and you could go to them between takes

08:15.489 --> 08:17.489
when we'll be cutting
away from you anyway.

08:17.558 --> 08:19.691
Okay, and what's the other option?

08:19.767 --> 08:22.182
We give you this earpiece. We would just

08:22.207 --> 08:23.919
cover it with your hair...

08:23.964 --> 08:25.242
And then cheat you away
from camera, so they can...

08:25.266 --> 08:26.932
Wait, guys. Slow down.

08:27.002 --> 08:29.135
Everybody just take a breath.

08:29.203 --> 08:31.582
Let me take Megan for a little walk.

08:31.607 --> 08:33.355
She's cuffed to a chair.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.504
Then leave so we can talk.

08:44.215 --> 08:46.344
I'm turning off your mic.

08:48.122 --> 08:49.955
Do not take the cue cards

08:50.024 --> 08:52.024
or that ridiculous earpiece.

08:52.092 --> 08:53.759
They tell you they want to help you,

08:53.827 --> 08:55.572
but the next thing you
know, you've got a reputation

08:55.596 --> 08:57.262
as a girl who can't learn her lines.

08:57.331 --> 08:59.242
You're better than that,
and you're way better off

08:59.266 --> 09:01.166
doing this on your own.

09:07.044 --> 09:09.309
He loved me.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.739
I don't know why you don't believe that.

09:12.947 --> 09:15.411
Maybe you've never been loved.

09:15.749 --> 09:17.349
Maybe that's why.

09:19.328 --> 09:23.188
We found your blood
on the toe of his boot.

09:23.257 --> 09:24.690
What kind of love is that?

09:24.758 --> 09:26.458
Tell me.

09:26.527 --> 09:28.060
And cut!

09:28.128 --> 09:32.019
Okay, let's un-cuff Megan
and we are turning around.

09:36.503 --> 09:39.485
My gosh. She's his girlfriend?

09:40.307 --> 09:42.841
- Dude, it's Kyle West.
- But you're here.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.609
I thought that was one of those movies

09:44.678 --> 09:47.412
that's an excuse to tour Europe.

09:47.481 --> 09:49.181
Croatia and Monaco eventually.

09:49.249 --> 09:50.349
We start in L.A.

09:50.417 --> 09:51.984
It gives me a chance to watch this one.

09:52.052 --> 09:53.251
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.820
Hi.

09:54.888 --> 09:56.855
This one is a major talent.

09:56.924 --> 09:58.992
Keep her close.

09:59.393 --> 10:01.393
She's being nice.

10:01.462 --> 10:03.562
They changed all of
today's scenes last night,

10:03.630 --> 10:04.941
and I don't know what
the hell I was doing.

10:04.965 --> 10:06.765
Whoa. Whoa, Megan.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.232
Nobody's saying that, okay?

10:08.257 --> 10:09.576
You totally got through it.

10:09.601 --> 10:10.702
I grew up idolizing her.

10:10.771 --> 10:12.671
I wanna do more than
just get through it.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.313
Look, I'm sorry to ask
you this right now, but...

10:21.382 --> 10:23.422
were you planning on going
to your house after this?

10:23.484 --> 10:24.716
Yeah, why?

10:24.785 --> 10:26.985
Can you come to mine instead?

10:27.054 --> 10:29.721
I don't like the idea of you
going alone to that rental

10:29.790 --> 10:32.076
- with absolutely no security at all.
- Kyle...

10:32.101 --> 10:34.793
Megan, now look, there is
some crazy asshole out there

10:34.862 --> 10:36.774
who at minimum wants to
scare the shit out of me,

10:36.798 --> 10:39.989
and he very easily
could come after you too.

10:43.404 --> 10:45.482
I want you to move in with me.

10:46.273 --> 10:47.672
Permanently.

10:47.741 --> 10:49.538
My house is the safest
place for both of us.

10:49.563 --> 10:50.675
My God.

10:50.744 --> 10:53.345
I'm trying to work,
and I'm doing my best

10:53.414 --> 10:54.546
not to freak out right now,

10:54.615 --> 10:56.448
but you're making it really hard.

10:56.517 --> 10:58.717
Megan, can we get
you back on set, please?

10:58.786 --> 11:01.396
Yes. Absolutely. Right now.

11:03.757 --> 11:05.791
Hey, how's it going?

11:05.859 --> 11:08.060
Hey. How you doing?

11:11.899 --> 11:13.209
There's been far too much concern

11:13.233 --> 11:16.168
about potential negative imagery
and... and celebrity clientele,

11:16.236 --> 11:19.538
and not enough focus on what
we actually have to offer here.

11:19.606 --> 11:21.840
We... we have an incredible,
progressive system

11:21.909 --> 11:23.341
for personal development,

11:23.410 --> 11:26.118
and we need to make our presence felt.

11:27.014 --> 11:29.214
The work deserves it.

11:29.283 --> 11:31.583
And the world deserves the work.

11:32.786 --> 11:34.953
So you'll talk with the facilitators?

11:35.022 --> 11:37.322
This should be our approach
across the board from now on.

11:37.391 --> 11:39.458
Yeah, I will.

11:39.526 --> 11:41.693
Maybe they'll have
better luck than I have.

11:42.176 --> 11:44.137
What does that mean?

11:44.398 --> 11:46.298
Shaun has tapered off.

11:46.366 --> 11:49.101
Yeah, I noticed.

11:49.169 --> 11:50.779
I keep trying to bring
her to the next level,

11:50.803 --> 11:53.171
but she says she's not ready.

11:53.545 --> 11:56.675
Not ready for what, the next
level with IHM or with you?

11:56.743 --> 11:59.611
Maybe both.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.936
Yeah, probably not both.

12:05.853 --> 12:07.668
Incoming, boys!

12:07.693 --> 12:09.621
Watch my six!

12:09.690 --> 12:12.921
We got a man down! Get
somebody over there now!

12:14.557 --> 12:15.747
Fall back!

12:15.772 --> 12:18.140
And cut it! Good!

12:18.180 --> 12:20.530
Great, guys. Moving on.

12:20.701 --> 12:22.634
Nice take, guys.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.638
Hello, love.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.858
Hey.

12:27.890 --> 12:29.486
How's the house? How are you holding up?

12:29.510 --> 12:30.809
The house is great.

12:30.878 --> 12:33.245
Got it all cleaned up,
kick-ass new security system.

12:33.313 --> 12:35.013
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

12:35.082 --> 12:37.620
Well, I have some news
you're not gonna love,

12:37.645 --> 12:39.084
but if we take a breath,

12:39.153 --> 12:41.486
we'll see that there's a
real silver lining here.

12:41.555 --> 12:43.355
Okay.

12:43.423 --> 12:46.191
We no longer have the
rights to "The Resistance."

12:46.260 --> 12:48.693
Rand didn't extend the option.

12:48.762 --> 12:50.228
What?

12:50.297 --> 12:51.796
Yeah, I was blindsided too.

12:51.865 --> 12:53.309
The extension should
have been pro forma,

12:53.333 --> 12:55.233
and the rights have
been sold to Premiere.

12:55.302 --> 12:56.935
For who?

12:57.004 --> 12:59.204
If you tell me Jeremy Renner,
I'm gonna lose my shit.

12:59.273 --> 13:00.605
Then I won't tell you.

13:00.674 --> 13:02.679
Son of a bitch.

13:04.011 --> 13:05.443
Is this an Adam Westfeldt move?

13:05.512 --> 13:06.807
Look, I don't know
what Adam was thinking.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.948
No, he was thinking he could
pacify me with a directing job

13:08.972 --> 13:11.283
and then kill it after I
signed off on Amelia Briggs.

13:11.351 --> 13:13.251
That's exactly what happened.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.994
Listen, I get that you're pissed.

13:15.019 --> 13:16.188
So was I.

13:16.256 --> 13:18.023
But we can try and
look at the opportunity

13:18.091 --> 13:19.271
that this gives us.

13:19.296 --> 13:20.972
"The Resistance" was the opportunity.

13:20.997 --> 13:22.953
I found the story.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.497
I've been working on
this for three years.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.585
Then let's move on to
a different project.

13:27.610 --> 13:29.510
One that's free of the studio's control.

13:29.579 --> 13:31.846
Look, I know the timing sucks,

13:31.915 --> 13:33.703
but this script...

13:33.983 --> 13:35.483
this is a special one, Kyle.

13:35.552 --> 13:37.118
Why don't you read this?

13:37.187 --> 13:38.286
No.

13:38.355 --> 13:40.254
I'm not moving on to anything else.

13:40.323 --> 13:41.600
Somehow, people have started to think

13:41.624 --> 13:43.224
that they can mess with me,

13:43.293 --> 13:44.992
and I'm not gonna let it happen.

13:47.228 --> 13:48.429
Kyle.

13:48.498 --> 13:49.864
Tell them I need an hour.

14:05.659 --> 14:07.315
Hey, buddy.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.945
Doing some work on
yourself? That'd be good.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.743
No, just checking in with
Terence. Talking long-term goals.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.917
In other words, you, my friend.

14:14.986 --> 14:16.485
We're not friends, Adam.

14:16.554 --> 14:18.887
And we're not making
movies together anymore.

14:18.956 --> 14:21.056
Okay, just slow down before
you go off half-cocked.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.992
You screwed me twice.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.627
It's not gonna happen a third time.

14:24.695 --> 14:26.540
You're going back to the
Amelia Briggs thing now?

14:26.564 --> 14:29.075
I put you in the best
possible situation to succeed.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.657
I'd love to get screwed that way.

14:30.682 --> 14:32.348
And killing "The Resistance"?

14:32.417 --> 14:35.030
- What's your spin on that one?
- I didn't kill anything.

14:35.055 --> 14:36.820
That was a legal snafu in the option

14:36.888 --> 14:38.455
that DeAnn said she'd handle.

14:41.998 --> 14:43.665
So it's DeAnn's fault

14:43.734 --> 14:45.600
she didn't fix your screw-up.

14:45.669 --> 14:48.059
It's DeAnn's fault
because she set the meeting

14:48.084 --> 14:50.238
with the rights owner,
and then bailed on it.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.589
I dropped the ball. That's fair.

14:52.614 --> 14:54.465
But if you want to know
why "The Resistance"

14:54.490 --> 14:56.357
is with Premiere right now,

14:56.424 --> 14:58.192
that's why.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.155
You really think that bullshit
story's gonna hold up in this town?

15:01.179 --> 15:02.519
It's the truth,

15:02.564 --> 15:04.278
and if you just take a breath,

15:04.326 --> 15:07.035
we can sit down and actually
have a productive conversation

15:07.060 --> 15:09.635
about what our next steps are.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.865
This one's been incredibly productive.

15:24.154 --> 15:26.847
You know, that last scene
was better than you think.

15:28.307 --> 15:30.059
No, I thought it was good,

15:30.084 --> 15:31.218
- I just...
- I know.

15:31.287 --> 15:35.622
You just wanted to break it
all down and figure it out.

15:35.691 --> 15:37.291
But don't be afraid to let raw instinct

15:37.359 --> 15:39.135
carry you once in a while.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.128
Sometimes you get the
best stuff by not thinking

15:41.153 --> 15:43.010
and just letting it be quick and dirty.

15:43.035 --> 15:44.802
Are we still talking about acting?

15:44.827 --> 15:47.061
It works for other things too.

15:47.403 --> 15:49.236
Thanks.

15:49.305 --> 15:51.741
And I'm glad I did
the scene with no help.

15:51.766 --> 15:53.468
If you hadn't said something,
I probably would've taken

15:53.492 --> 15:55.491
the earpiece just so
Patrick wouldn't freak out.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.980
That's one of the biggest
problems in this business.

16:00.049 --> 16:02.916
People freak out.

16:02.985 --> 16:05.376
When I did "Opposite of Jessica,"

16:05.717 --> 16:08.232
there was this asshole studio
head who shall remain nameless.

16:08.257 --> 16:10.243
Howard Levin!

16:10.268 --> 16:13.970
Who told some assistant that
he didn't want to sleep with me

16:13.995 --> 16:16.095
because I wasn't skinny enough.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.822
- Gross. Are you kidding?
- Nope.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.918
And the assistant blabbed to a producer,

16:20.986 --> 16:23.153
and suddenly, they started
changing my wardrobe,

16:23.222 --> 16:25.021
even the way they lit and shot me.

16:25.090 --> 16:26.857
The entire production was terrified,

16:26.925 --> 16:28.569
and I was a mess.

16:28.594 --> 16:31.261
How did you get through that?

16:31.330 --> 16:32.996
Shirley Tate.

16:33.065 --> 16:34.698
She went to the producers and told them

16:34.766 --> 16:37.326
that she and her multiple
Oscars were quitting

16:37.351 --> 16:39.880
unless the nonsense stopped.
And the nonsense stopped.

16:39.905 --> 16:41.371
I love that.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.440
The original take-no-shit gangster.

16:43.509 --> 16:45.809
She was a wonderful woman.

16:45.878 --> 16:48.245
We stick together in this business.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.470
Someday you'll pay it forward too.

16:52.651 --> 16:54.217
Well, I appreciate you coming.

16:54.286 --> 16:56.019
I understand work has you very busy.

16:56.088 --> 16:58.691
James been keeping you posted?

16:58.716 --> 17:00.423
When I ask.

17:00.492 --> 17:04.480
Well, work's been pretty
much round the clock lately.

17:04.505 --> 17:07.164
Yet you still managed
to come here today.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.965
Well, like you said, you asked.

17:10.035 --> 17:13.036
Yes, but I'm not your boss,
Shaun. You could've said no.

17:14.453 --> 17:15.996
I know.

17:16.326 --> 17:19.327
So maybe what I'm hearing
about you losing interest in IHM

17:19.373 --> 17:21.873
isn't entirely accurate?

17:21.943 --> 17:23.742
Wha... I never said

17:23.811 --> 17:25.550
I was losing interest.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.845
It's just hard to
figure out how it fits in

17:27.914 --> 17:30.415
with the rest of my life.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.683
But I am going to try and make

17:31.751 --> 17:33.384
the Anatomy of Leadership this weekend.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.553
Forget the seminar.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.989
I've got something that
will eat up less of your time

17:38.058 --> 17:40.425
and give you more bang for your buck.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.173
We're starting a child
development program.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.695
The First Life Initiative.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.431
The idea is to create a path
to adulthood weaving education

17:46.499 --> 17:49.546
with IHM's philosophies on awareness.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.474
That... that sounds amazing.

17:52.499 --> 17:54.138
I agree.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.052
As a result, we've applied
for non-profit status,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.209
but my in-house council
has decided to build

17:58.278 --> 17:59.944
his column in Switzerland.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.479
So you need a lawyer?

18:01.548 --> 18:02.914
Yeah.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.392
A good one.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.162
Someone who knows how to
create a structure that will

18:06.186 --> 18:07.852
help us avoid certain...

18:07.921 --> 18:09.787
Regulatory inefficiencies.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.589
Well said.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.927
So are you ready to use
your powers for good?

18:25.886 --> 18:27.552
Hello?

18:30.226 --> 18:31.776
Hey.

18:31.845 --> 18:34.011
I wasn't expecting you.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.313
What's this?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.882
You asked me to move in.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.218
This isn't all your stuff, is it?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.419
God, no.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.921
This is, like, the tip of my iceberg.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.091
But I'm prepared to bring
the rest under one condition.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.367
You're prepared to go full iceberg?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.529
I am.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.232
I love you,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.868
and I want us to share
our lives with each other,

18:56.936 --> 18:59.604
and I'm sorry for how I
reacted when you asked,

18:59.672 --> 19:03.349
but you have to promise me that
you're not doing this out of fear.

19:03.374 --> 19:05.410
Look, when... when Nic and I decided

19:05.478 --> 19:07.378
to live with each other,

19:07.447 --> 19:09.709
we did it to save money, but...

19:09.734 --> 19:12.131
we weren't actually ready
to be with each other.

19:12.187 --> 19:13.199
Megan...

19:13.224 --> 19:15.219
And I just want to make
sure that you're ready.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.054
Okay? This is a big step.

19:17.123 --> 19:21.506
I know, and I'm really sorry
for the way that I asked.

19:21.531 --> 19:23.194
It's this whole break-in thing.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.563
Whoever this stalker is...

19:25.632 --> 19:27.031
I can deal with it.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.017
I am dealing with it.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.774
It's just...

19:32.172 --> 19:34.578
I realized that you're
the only person in my life

19:34.603 --> 19:36.407
that I can trust.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.343
I'm surrounded by people who
use me to get what they want,

19:39.412 --> 19:43.571
and I'm trying to figure
out a way to change all that.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.392
What happened with you and Terence?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.690
I gotta keep that between Terence and I.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.559
Is that okay?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.841
Sure, yeah.

19:55.866 --> 19:57.628
It's your business.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.331
But I am ready to live
with you and your iceberg

20:00.400 --> 20:01.737
- in this house.
- Okay.

20:01.762 --> 20:03.100
And I'm not afraid.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.369
Good, because I already
made a date with the girls

20:05.438 --> 20:07.772
to pack up my place tomorrow night.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.574
Does it have to be at night?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.175
- Kyle.
- I'm sorry, you know,

20:11.244 --> 20:13.088
I'm just saying that this
guy is still out there,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.179
and you can't just assume that
he's not gonna come after you.

20:15.203 --> 20:17.328
I will lock the windows and the doors,

20:17.422 --> 20:19.495
and then I'm gonna enjoy
saying good-bye to the place

20:19.519 --> 20:21.385
I've lived in for, like, five years.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.753
Okay?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.290
- Okay.
- I'm gonna run a bath.

20:31.449 --> 20:35.222
Out of everyone, you
surprise me the most.

20:35.246 --> 20:36.715
Give me a chance to explain?

20:36.740 --> 20:38.114
Nope, don't have time.

20:38.182 --> 20:39.644
I gotta get some reading done.

20:39.692 --> 20:41.859
You know, I do want to
ask you one thing, though.

20:41.927 --> 20:43.705
If you didn't want me
directing "The Resistance,"

20:43.729 --> 20:45.128
why didn't you just tell me?

20:45.197 --> 20:47.498
I did want you to
direct "The Resistance,"

20:47.566 --> 20:50.070
but then Adam let the
rights go, and I thought...

20:50.095 --> 20:52.401
Please. I don't have time for
this he said, she said crap.

20:52.471 --> 20:54.008
Kyle.

20:54.024 --> 20:55.923
He let the rights go,
and I started to think

20:55.992 --> 20:58.026
of the contingency plan
like any producer would,

20:58.094 --> 21:00.161
and that's when I found
"Technicolor Highway,"

21:00.230 --> 21:02.230
and I realized it is
a much better choice

21:02.299 --> 21:03.865
for your first directing job.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.933
It's edgy, it's contemporary,

21:06.002 --> 21:07.913
you're not burdened by the
restrictions of the period.

21:07.937 --> 21:10.705
There's a great part in it
for Megan, and best of all...

21:10.774 --> 21:12.709
You still haven't answered my question.

21:12.734 --> 21:16.569
Best of all, we can
make it independently.

21:16.594 --> 21:19.391
No studio telling you
what it needs to be.

21:24.788 --> 21:27.785
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd say no.

21:28.491 --> 21:30.258
Thank you.

21:30.327 --> 21:31.973
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got some work to do.

21:31.997 --> 21:33.897
- Kyle...
- No, look,

21:33.973 --> 21:35.273
I wanted to do the other movie.

21:35.341 --> 21:36.807
I loved it.

21:36.876 --> 21:38.209
Dreamed about it.

21:38.278 --> 21:39.955
And I can't work with
someone who thinks they can

21:39.979 --> 21:41.679
take that away from me.

21:44.851 --> 21:47.485
Is this trash or donate?

21:47.554 --> 21:49.820
I love that lamp.

21:49.889 --> 21:52.423
I haggled with an old
Russian lady for 30 minutes

21:52.492 --> 21:54.358
to get that down to ten bucks.

21:54.427 --> 21:55.793
Well, it looks like ten bucks,

21:55.862 --> 21:57.498
and it smells like paste.

21:57.523 --> 21:59.764
Chuck it.

22:02.435 --> 22:03.601
My God!

22:03.670 --> 22:05.136
- What?
- What were you, like,

22:05.161 --> 22:06.901
running a daycare?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.373
No, I like games.

22:09.442 --> 22:13.614
You cannot take these to
that beautiful house, Megan.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.948
Hey, I had to get three
paralegals to cover me at work,

22:17.016 --> 22:18.749
so I got no time for nostalgia.

22:18.818 --> 22:20.698
The only way to do this
right is to be ruthless.

22:20.753 --> 22:23.020
Fine, donate.

22:23.089 --> 22:24.755
Okey dokey.

22:24.824 --> 22:26.857
Hi-dee-ho, ready to go!

22:26.926 --> 22:30.035
Let's stuff some boxes, bitches.

22:30.263 --> 22:31.929
That sound a lot less dirty

22:31.998 --> 22:33.114
when I said it in my head.

22:33.162 --> 22:35.089
Okay, that pile can be yours.

22:35.134 --> 22:38.091
We're sorting into
keep, trash, and donate.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.748
And a very warm hello to you, too.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.907
Only keep the essentials.

22:42.976 --> 22:44.609
We're being ruthless.

22:44.677 --> 22:46.629
Ruthless, got it.

22:49.897 --> 22:50.995
What is this?

22:51.020 --> 22:52.450
Donate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:52.518 --> 22:54.778
You cannot throw out
The Deck of Nonsense.

22:54.803 --> 22:55.886
- See!
- Yes, we can.

22:55.955 --> 22:57.288
I told her.

22:57.357 --> 22:58.991
Captain Party Pooper.
Put this in a safe place.

22:59.015 --> 23:01.840
- Captain Party Pooper!
- This we don't care about.

23:01.865 --> 23:03.521
He said he wanted to
strike out on his own?

23:03.545 --> 23:04.795
Well, he made it very clear

23:04.864 --> 23:06.664
he didn't want to work with me anymore.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.428
That's unfortunate.

23:08.701 --> 23:10.162
Unfortunate?

23:10.903 --> 23:13.170
I don't know what you want me to say.

23:13.239 --> 23:15.885
How about you tell me
what your plan B is?

23:15.910 --> 23:18.376
Because I don't think he's
gonna wake up and realize

23:18.444 --> 23:20.311
he needs us anytime soon.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.413
He's not falling apart
like you imagined.

23:22.482 --> 23:24.549
I never said anything about us.

23:26.581 --> 23:29.387
Wow, I guess I missed the part
where it wasn't us anymore.

23:29.455 --> 23:31.088
Did you?

23:31.157 --> 23:32.968
'Cause I remember pretty
clearly you telling me

23:32.992 --> 23:35.059
to stay in my lane, to
leave the producing to you.

23:35.128 --> 23:36.994
I said that because
you went behind my back.

23:37.063 --> 23:39.797
Which is exactly what
you just did with Kyle,

23:39.866 --> 23:41.777
so maybe if you acknowledged
I had the better idea,

23:41.801 --> 23:44.101
it wouldn't bother you so much.

23:44.554 --> 23:46.082
Better for Kyle?

23:46.107 --> 23:47.340
Of course.

23:50.842 --> 23:54.744
There was a time when
you and I came first.

23:56.190 --> 23:58.024
No matter what we did
or who we did it with,

23:58.092 --> 24:00.626
we made sure that we were okay.

24:02.697 --> 24:04.658
When did that change?

24:10.347 --> 24:11.916
Lisbeth.

24:12.807 --> 24:14.707
Kyle fell apart and he took us with him.

24:14.776 --> 24:16.277
No.

24:16.332 --> 24:17.743
He took you.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.027
You might be right.

24:22.144 --> 24:24.283
Look, I felt responsible.

24:24.352 --> 24:25.754
Like I'd failed him,

24:25.779 --> 24:28.449
and I've been overcompensating
since to make up for that.

24:28.512 --> 24:30.512
DeAnn, I've done some things that I...

24:30.581 --> 24:32.347
that I truly regret,

24:32.416 --> 24:34.527
which I need to make right.

24:35.052 --> 24:37.346
And I need to make
things right with you too.

24:43.827 --> 24:46.361
What if Kyle really doesn't come back?

24:47.665 --> 24:49.431
He will.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.411
But if he doesn't,

24:53.020 --> 24:55.136
will there be anything left of us?

24:58.442 --> 25:00.342
Of course.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.323
Have you read anything good yet?

25:14.391 --> 25:16.692
Yeah, the only decent one
is about three generations

25:16.760 --> 25:19.227
of Italian mobsters living in Sicily.

25:19.296 --> 25:21.163
Isn't that "Godfather II"?

25:21.231 --> 25:23.498
Pretty much.

25:23.567 --> 25:24.710
How are you guys doing over there?

25:24.734 --> 25:25.767
It's good.

25:25.836 --> 25:27.502
Hope rescued my game stash,

25:27.571 --> 25:29.371
so we're taking a tiny
little packing break.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.505
Okay.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.509
I'm gonna get back at it.

25:32.943 --> 25:35.210
You okay over there by yourself?

25:39.683 --> 25:41.516
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:41.585 --> 25:44.663
Listen, you stay safe
over there, all right?

25:44.688 --> 25:46.455
I'll hit you back in a bit.

25:46.523 --> 25:48.142
Okay.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.703
All right.

25:53.497 --> 25:55.364
Kyle.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.900
Jesus.

25:58.969 --> 26:01.406
- Forgot you were still here.
- Sorry.

26:01.431 --> 26:03.205
I gave Juliet the new
codes for the gate.

26:03.273 --> 26:06.074
She'll be here at
7:30 to cook breakfast.

26:06.143 --> 26:08.143
Okay, good.

26:08.212 --> 26:10.590
I was gonna take off for the
night, unless you need anything?

26:10.614 --> 26:12.981
No. No, no, I'm good. Thanks.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.202
Okay, no, I... no, I
seriously have you so beat.

26:25.227 --> 26:26.884
Like, so badly.

26:26.909 --> 26:28.733
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

26:28.758 --> 26:30.791
- Lay it down, girl.
- Are you gonna sell it?

26:30.860 --> 26:32.093
You know I'm gonna sell it.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.999
Of course you would give me this card.

26:37.066 --> 26:38.966
Of course you would. Okay, um...

26:40.593 --> 26:42.622
Coming in a theater near you...

26:44.073 --> 26:47.174
"The Movie."

26:50.202 --> 26:51.902
I've literally seen that movie.

26:51.971 --> 26:54.853
Like, so many times in real life.

26:54.878 --> 26:56.407
I miss hanging out with you guys.

26:56.475 --> 26:57.741
- I know.
- It's been so long.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.243
Shit!

26:59.312 --> 27:00.844
You know what we should do right now?

27:00.913 --> 27:03.708
We should go to Skylark Club for dinner

27:03.733 --> 27:05.227
and make them give us
the employee discount.

27:05.251 --> 27:07.413
That would actually be awesome.

27:07.452 --> 27:09.428
But I don't work at
Skylark Club anymore, so...

27:09.488 --> 27:11.088
What? Why?

27:11.157 --> 27:13.925
It was Bruno! He kept
bothering me to be a manager,

27:13.950 --> 27:16.694
so eventually I just had
to tell him to go suck it.

27:16.762 --> 27:19.563
Because he offered you a promotion?

27:19.632 --> 27:21.865
Yes, because it means he
thinks I'm not gonna make it

27:21.934 --> 27:23.200
as an actress, so...

27:23.269 --> 27:24.680
Yeah, managing a restaurant is, like,

27:24.704 --> 27:26.303
40 hours a week minimum.

27:26.372 --> 27:27.871
There's no time to audition.

27:27.978 --> 27:30.592
Okay.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.536
What does that even mean?

27:32.561 --> 27:34.001
Do you have something to say, Shaun?

27:34.063 --> 27:35.826
You... you made the right choice.

27:35.851 --> 27:37.432
You're an amazing actress.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.000
So stay strong, mi amiga.

27:39.069 --> 27:40.301
And you.

27:40.370 --> 27:41.606
Pick a card.

27:44.523 --> 27:46.908
The road to hell is paved with...

27:46.976 --> 27:48.276
Micropenises.

28:59.893 --> 29:02.383
Jesus, are you seriously
worrying about a stalker

29:02.452 --> 29:03.698
coming to get us?

29:03.723 --> 29:06.154
I think I'm seriously drunk,

29:06.222 --> 29:10.091
but I promised Kyle I'd
lock up, so I'm locking up.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.626
So Kyle's a little worried?

29:11.694 --> 29:13.194
A little. I get it.

29:13.263 --> 29:15.696
I mean, he came home and his
place was totally trashed,

29:15.765 --> 29:17.465
and the person's still out there.

29:17.534 --> 29:20.701
Yeah, well, that person
didn't even take anything,

29:20.770 --> 29:24.005
which just screams
of a giant power trip.

29:24.073 --> 29:25.873
Hello? Who does that sound like?

29:25.926 --> 29:27.826
Who does it sound like?

29:27.851 --> 29:29.317
Gandhi.

29:31.648 --> 29:33.229
Terence Anderson!

29:33.254 --> 29:36.581
Why on Earth would Terence
break into Kyle's house?

29:36.606 --> 29:39.720
Um, because he's creepy
and he runs a cult.

29:39.789 --> 29:41.756
Did no one go to the police
with this information?

29:41.825 --> 29:43.228
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

29:43.276 --> 29:46.150
Actually, Kyle and Terence
did have a falling out.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.972
Fine, but that doesn't mean

29:47.997 --> 29:50.397
Terence would trash Kyle's house.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.267
You... you seriously have no
idea what you're talking about

29:53.336 --> 29:55.055
so you should just stop.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.506
I'm not even sure why
you're defending him,

29:57.531 --> 30:00.358
and B, why are you
being such an asshole?

30:00.383 --> 30:01.931
Wha... I'm not the one talking shit

30:02.000 --> 30:03.296
about someone I don't even know.

30:03.321 --> 30:06.422
- You don't know him either.
- I do know Terence.

30:09.927 --> 30:12.561
I've been going to
seminars at the Institute...

30:12.586 --> 30:14.543
for weeks now.

30:15.051 --> 30:16.621
What?

30:17.487 --> 30:21.379
Terence asked me to help
him with some legal work.

30:21.404 --> 30:22.857
Legal work?

30:22.925 --> 30:24.692
I didn't realize you were that involved.

30:24.717 --> 30:28.004
Holy shit, you're a pod person.

30:28.631 --> 30:31.449
Totally explains why you
haven't been returning my calls.

30:31.474 --> 30:34.244
Shaun, why didn't you tell me?

30:35.712 --> 30:37.111
You're right.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.373
I'm sorry.

30:39.442 --> 30:42.279
But... trust me, Megan.

30:42.413 --> 30:44.814
Terence is not your problem.

30:44.882 --> 30:46.148
Yeah, no.

30:46.217 --> 30:47.950
No, for sure, totally not your problem.

30:47.975 --> 30:51.278
He can manipulate your
boyfriend into firing you

30:51.303 --> 30:52.688
off of his movie, but no,

30:52.757 --> 30:54.890
don't worry about him;
He's not your problem.

30:54.959 --> 30:58.143
How can you even just sit here
and act like you're the one

30:58.168 --> 30:59.829
who has Megan's back?

30:59.897 --> 31:02.698
What, did you just
forget about what you did?

31:04.535 --> 31:06.936
Okay, Shaun, enough.

31:07.005 --> 31:10.640
No, I think this
conversation is way overdue.

31:10.708 --> 31:13.350
I think this conversation
sucks right now.

31:13.375 --> 31:14.588
What are you guys talking about?

31:14.612 --> 31:16.108
Tell her.

31:16.133 --> 31:18.400
- Or I will.
- Tell me what?

31:21.419 --> 31:23.452
Hope's the one who
gave your naked pictures

31:23.477 --> 31:25.010
to the press.

31:27.859 --> 31:30.026
You did that?

31:31.696 --> 31:33.011
Why?

31:33.036 --> 31:35.264
Because you finally had your big break,

31:35.333 --> 31:37.361
- and she couldn't handle it.
- That is not why!

31:37.386 --> 31:38.801
You know... you...

31:40.071 --> 31:41.304
You know what?

31:41.372 --> 31:44.073
I'm really sorry I
had to tell you, Megan,

31:44.142 --> 31:47.209
but, I can't do this anymore.

31:54.018 --> 31:56.952
Okay, please, just hear
me. Just hear me, please.

31:58.656 --> 31:59.989
Okay, yeah.

32:00.058 --> 32:03.264
Kyle kicked me out of his
party and I was pissed...

32:03.289 --> 32:05.380
- Holy shit.
- No! Listen.

32:05.405 --> 32:07.930
The people from the Institute
like Kyle and Terence,

32:07.999 --> 32:09.643
I keep trying to tell you
that they're dangerous,

32:09.667 --> 32:12.535
- and you're just not hearing me.
- You humiliated me

32:12.603 --> 32:15.514
in front of millions of people.

32:15.539 --> 32:19.989
I thought that a scandal would
make them leave you alone.

32:20.014 --> 32:22.725
- It was the trade-off, right?
- My God.

32:22.871 --> 32:25.805
No, but it was a horrible idea.

32:25.830 --> 32:28.494
It was a terrible,
bad, stupid thing to do.

32:28.519 --> 32:30.086
And I'm really sorry that I hurt you,

32:30.154 --> 32:32.188
but it all came from love.

32:32.256 --> 32:34.357
No, I-I...

32:34.440 --> 32:38.075
I do not do that
version of love anymore.

32:39.799 --> 32:41.832
I can't have you in my life.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.165
Megan, I made a mistake.

32:43.234 --> 32:46.395
No. You need to leave.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.737
Now.

33:30.221 --> 33:31.847
What are you doing here?

33:34.863 --> 33:37.048
We're overdue a meal together.

33:40.466 --> 33:41.991
How'd you get in?

33:43.741 --> 33:45.741
How do you think?

33:45.766 --> 33:47.378
I have the code.

33:52.537 --> 33:54.069
What the hell are you doing?

33:55.907 --> 33:57.383
Stop it!

33:59.464 --> 34:00.936
Stop!

34:36.398 --> 34:38.246
Christ. Shit.

34:41.469 --> 34:42.789
Megan.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.455
I'm so sorry.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.259
What happened? You okay?

34:50.328 --> 34:52.328
Hope leaked the photos of me.

34:53.331 --> 34:55.531
And Shaun...

34:57.098 --> 34:59.435
I don't know who my friends are anymore.

35:00.838 --> 35:02.759
Come on, let's get you to bed.

35:28.756 --> 35:30.263
Business.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.045
Well, okay then.

35:34.070 --> 35:37.296
This is a contract for
the rights to your script.

35:37.364 --> 35:40.431
And a check for $100,000.

35:41.301 --> 35:43.301
Kyle wants to do it?

35:43.370 --> 35:45.503
No, not yet.

35:45.572 --> 35:48.873
But one way or another, I
will get this movie made.

35:48.942 --> 35:50.041
Wow.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.685
I don't know what to...

35:52.278 --> 35:53.551
thank you.

35:53.576 --> 35:55.113
There's a condition.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.583
You don't come anywhere
near this production, and...

36:00.020 --> 36:01.586
you and I part ways.

36:01.654 --> 36:03.338
Because you don't want Kyle or Megan

36:03.363 --> 36:04.863
to know how this got started.

36:04.931 --> 36:06.585
Or anyone else.

36:07.586 --> 36:10.553
I didn't realize this would
end with me disappearing.

36:10.622 --> 36:11.905
You disappear.

36:13.692 --> 36:16.907
But Ann Toren...

36:17.126 --> 36:20.230
can walk into any
studio with this credit

36:20.298 --> 36:23.031
and her next great idea, and get a deal.

36:23.056 --> 36:25.226
It's called a nom de plume,

36:25.828 --> 36:29.344
and it's your chance to have
something real in this business.

36:29.398 --> 36:31.240
You should grab it.

36:36.105 --> 36:39.102
So the key is to take
a few minutes each month

36:39.127 --> 36:40.932
to make sure you both
know the new codes.

36:40.957 --> 36:43.424
And at least you know it's working now.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.990
Yeah. Yeah, now the alarm works well.

36:46.429 --> 36:48.349
I gotta give this
back to you, though.

36:49.783 --> 36:51.450
I don't want it in the house anymore.

36:51.475 --> 36:52.641
Well, it's your call.

36:52.666 --> 36:55.133
Like I said, if you want to be safe,

36:55.240 --> 36:57.440
you're gonna need more than you got now.

36:57.509 --> 36:59.209
I know.

36:59.277 --> 37:01.092
I have something in mind.

37:08.153 --> 37:09.544
Hello there.

37:09.569 --> 37:10.787
Hey.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.095
You doing something on the lot?

37:12.123 --> 37:13.990
Actually, I came by to bring you

37:14.059 --> 37:16.793
a housewarming gift of sorts.

37:16.861 --> 37:18.828
I'd like you to read this.

37:18.897 --> 37:20.830
"Technicolor Highway"?

37:20.899 --> 37:22.230
Who's Ann Toren?

37:22.255 --> 37:23.458
A completely unknown writer,

37:23.483 --> 37:25.535
but this script will
knock your socks off.

37:25.604 --> 37:27.670
It's a smart, completely fresh take

37:27.739 --> 37:29.272
on Southern California Gothic,

37:29.341 --> 37:31.307
and you would be perfect for the lead.

37:32.911 --> 37:35.778
You want me to read this and
then tell Kyle to direct it.

37:35.847 --> 37:37.213
I'm sorry,

37:37.282 --> 37:38.514
I'm not getting in the middle

37:38.583 --> 37:40.063
of whatever's going on with you guys.

37:40.118 --> 37:42.619
Megan, I just want you to read it.

37:42.687 --> 37:44.554
Because if you connect
with it like I did,

37:44.623 --> 37:46.322
you'll go to Kyle regardless.

37:46.391 --> 37:49.792
This is our chance for the three
of us to make a movie our way,

37:49.861 --> 37:51.761
with no interference.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.833
Or maybe you won't like it, which case,

37:56.901 --> 37:58.768
forget everything I said.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.667
New pages for you.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.278
Seriously? Again?

38:08.346 --> 38:10.594
I don't call the
shots, I just give them.

38:25.163 --> 38:28.573
Whoever that is, it's me
time! Come back in ten minutes!

38:28.598 --> 38:31.588
Hi, it's Megan. I need to talk to you.

38:36.174 --> 38:39.151
What is it? I'm decompressing.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.412
Late-night writing?

38:42.480 --> 38:45.993
Actually, Patrick and I
rewrote the pages this morning.

38:46.018 --> 38:48.418
And yesterday too, I guess?

38:48.486 --> 38:51.287
I'm an executive producer
on the show, sweetie.

38:51.356 --> 38:53.334
It's my responsibility to
make sure that the product

38:53.358 --> 38:55.489
we're putting out there
is as good as it can be.

38:55.514 --> 38:57.727
Even if it means making me look bad?

39:01.599 --> 39:03.724
You're not the product, Megan.

39:03.749 --> 39:06.583
I am, and I have to protect myself.

39:06.652 --> 39:08.054
I've been doing this long enough to know

39:08.078 --> 39:10.587
that no one else is going
to do it, and let's be real,

39:10.656 --> 39:12.006
you didn't look bad.

39:12.031 --> 39:14.134
No, I just sat there
looking like an idiot

39:14.159 --> 39:16.460
while I listened to a bunch
of fake outrage and bullshit

39:16.528 --> 39:18.128
about the sisterhood.

39:18.197 --> 39:20.097
You lied to me.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.850
I could've just told you to
quit panicking and suck it up.

39:22.935 --> 39:24.177
- Would that have been better?
- I wasn't panicking.

39:24.201 --> 39:25.347
I was just surprised
that this happened...

39:25.371 --> 39:26.373
You were panicking,

39:26.398 --> 39:28.882
and I gave you a friend and an ally,

39:28.907 --> 39:30.719
which is a hell of a lot
more than people have given me

39:30.743 --> 39:32.341
over the years.

39:32.678 --> 39:35.111
I'm sorry you didn't feel supported.

39:35.597 --> 39:38.448
I have seven more minutes to myself.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.133
Go learn your lines.

39:43.488 --> 39:45.355
Millennial bullshit.

39:48.504 --> 39:50.560
- Welcome home.
- Aww.

39:50.629 --> 39:52.162
Hey, we got beer, right?

39:52.231 --> 39:54.495
- Hell yeah, we got beer.
- Yeah.

39:55.934 --> 39:57.434
Things must have went well today.

39:57.503 --> 39:59.336
Actually...

39:59.405 --> 40:01.516
no, it was pretty much a nightmare.

40:01.541 --> 40:04.399
I got new pages at
the last minute again,

40:04.446 --> 40:06.476
and then I discovered that Charlotte

40:06.545 --> 40:08.203
actually helped rewrite them,

40:08.266 --> 40:10.893
so not only did I wander
blindly through the scenes,

40:10.918 --> 40:14.153
but my childhood idol ended
up being completely two-faced.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.906
And then?

40:18.343 --> 40:20.021
'Cause it seems like
you're in a good mood.

40:20.045 --> 40:21.611
And then...

40:21.680 --> 40:24.080
I read this.

40:30.255 --> 40:32.543
DeAnn came to see me.

40:33.258 --> 40:34.591
Jesus.

40:34.659 --> 40:35.859
I tell her I'm not interested,

40:35.894 --> 40:37.208
and she goes behind my back to you.

40:37.232 --> 40:38.632
I know that's exactly what she did,

40:38.663 --> 40:40.063
and I told her it wasn't cool,

40:40.131 --> 40:41.931
but, babe...

40:42.000 --> 40:45.230
this script is really good.

40:45.254 --> 40:46.603
I mean it.

40:46.671 --> 40:49.873
It's so real and visceral,

40:49.941 --> 40:51.774
and yet totally about character.

40:51.843 --> 40:53.254
And the whole time I was reading it...

40:53.278 --> 40:54.677
I read it twice, actually...

40:54.746 --> 40:58.481
I just kept thinking
that this script is so us.

41:02.454 --> 41:04.747
"Technicolor Highway."

41:05.323 --> 41:06.756
Who's Ann Toren?

41:06.825 --> 41:09.659
I don't know, but she's the real deal.

41:49.683 --> 41:52.003
Dear Kyle,

41:52.028 --> 41:54.284
I'm running out of time.

41:55.394 --> 41:59.074
It's time for me to face the
consequences for what I did.

42:00.854 --> 42:03.918
You can still distance yourself from me.

42:04.298 --> 42:06.275
Kyle...

42:06.300 --> 42:08.907
I only hope you can believe the truth...

42:10.019 --> 42:11.501
that I love you...

42:11.572 --> 42:14.595
and I'm so, so sorry...
