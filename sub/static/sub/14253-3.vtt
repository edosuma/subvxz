WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:04.598
Torres to Voyager.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.634
l could use a little help here.

00:07.707 --> 00:08.765
What's your status?

00:08.875 --> 00:10.399
l'm approaching your position,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.637
but that ion storm
blew out my deflector field.

00:12.712 --> 00:15.203
l've lost helm control,

00:15.281 --> 00:18.045
and l'm venting plasma
from the port nacelle.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.518
We're modifying a tractor pulse
to slow you down.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.214
Acknowledged.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.778
The arresting fields
are in place.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.789
You're clear to land.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.950
Hold on, B'Elanna.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.050
This is going to be bumpy.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.741 --> 00:43.231
B'Elanna?

00:43.343 --> 00:45.243
Oh.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.573
Are you alive?

00:47.647 --> 00:49.274
You tell me.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.646
You've got a mild concussion.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.283
That's the best thing
that's happened to me all day.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.319
When l give you an order,
l expect you to follow it.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.888
l told you to return to Voyager,

01:07.000 --> 01:07.898
not chase the probe

01:08.001 --> 01:09.935
into the center
of an ion storm.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.470
We only have one
multispatial probe.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.765
l didn't want to lose it.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.499
We only have
one B'Elanna Torres.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.302
l don't want to lose her,
either.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.936
Understood.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.479
Lanna...

01:21.548 --> 01:24.711
l'm glad you made it back
in one piece.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.274
Did you just call me ''Lanna''?

01:27.353 --> 01:28.945
l suppose l did.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.218
That's what my mother
used to call me.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.954
Well, then, l'm in good company.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.039
Come in.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.938
Feeling better?

01:52.011 --> 01:53.171
l've felt worse.

01:53.246 --> 01:55.771
l found something you might
be interested in.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.579
lt's what my ancestors called
a ''monkey wrench.''

01:58.651 --> 02:00.551
lt was lodged
in your port nacelle.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.212
How did it get there?

02:02.288 --> 02:05.553
Judging by your sensor logs,
it looks like you ran into it

02:05.625 --> 02:07.684
after your deflector field
collapsed.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.991
But the big question is:
How did it get in this quadrant?

02:11.064 --> 02:14.056
What do you mean?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.101
What?

02:16.169 --> 02:17.397
lt's Klingon.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.698
And it's old.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.238
That's about all we know.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.742
Looks like the Klingons beat
Starfleet to the Delta Quadrant

02:23.843 --> 02:25.208
by a few hundred years.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.577
You may be holding the most
important archaeological find

02:28.648 --> 02:29.945
in Klingon history.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.052
Remind me to plant a flag
on behalf of the Empire.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.349
You know, the simplest
explanation

02:35.421 --> 02:38.322
is that the Borg assimilated
a bird- of- prey

02:38.391 --> 02:40.450
somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant,

02:40.527 --> 02:43.860
and they blew it out an airlock
on their way home.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.454
Maybe so.

02:45.532 --> 02:49.730
ln any case, it makes
a nice souvenir.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.454
Harry, it bled, it screamed.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.083
There's got to be
some explanation.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.320
Hey, l've got one for you.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.362
You hit your head harder
than you thought.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.863
l wasn't hallucinating.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.126
Now, run a submolecular scan.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.327
How many more scans
are we going to run?

05:36.436 --> 05:38.267
There is nothing there.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.568
No fluid or vapor residue.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.666
We may find some irregularities
at the atomic level.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.744
lt's a hunk of metal.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.746
What you heard
may have had nothing to do

05:47.814 --> 05:49.076
with this artifact.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.740
Maybe the com system

05:50.817 --> 05:52.478
picked up some stray
signal from a pulsar- -

05:52.552 --> 05:53.484
l don't know.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.418
A pulsar that speaks Klingon.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.151
Okay, B'Elanna, there
probably is some explanation

05:59.225 --> 06:01.955
for what happened,
but it's 0300 hours.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.360
l'm tired, you're tired.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.660
Let's just stick this thing
in a containment field

06:06.733 --> 06:08.394
and deal with it in the morning.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.991
Ah! Just the daughter

06:10.103 --> 06:12.401
of the Empire
l've been looking for.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.872
l wanted to be the first
to congratulate you

06:14.941 --> 06:17.239
on your discovery
of the Klingon artifact.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.278
Neelix, l ran into it
with a shuttle.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.007
Some of the greatest discoveries
in Klingon history

06:22.081 --> 06:23.412
were accidents.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.543
When Sarpek the Fearless
unearthed the Knife of Kiromm

06:26.619 --> 06:28.746
he was searching
for his lost targ.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.880
lsn't that amazing?

06:30.957 --> 06:32.390
l've been doing some research.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.447
Why?

06:33.526 --> 06:35.084
Well, l'm planning
a celebration.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.822
This... must be the treasure.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.727
Neelix, look, l appreciate
your enthusiasm,

06:38.798 --> 06:40.026
but since l'm the only
Klingon onboard,

06:40.099 --> 06:41.566
there's really no point
in throwing a party.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.896
Oh, nonsense.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.936
This artifact isn't just
a testament to Klingon spirit.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.267
lt's a piece
of the Alpha Quadrant- -

06:48.341 --> 06:50.571
a symbol of Voyager's home,

06:50.643 --> 06:52.873
and that's just as worthy
of celebration and song

06:52.945 --> 06:54.537
as finding some old knife.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.206
Man's got a point.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.271
Besides, l've already

06:57.350 --> 06:59.147
replicated five barrels
of bloodwine.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.549
l'm not going to let them
go to waste.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.144
Festivities begin
at 1900 hours.

07:02.221 --> 07:05.088
Oh! Uh, l almost forgot.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.023
As guest of honor,
you're gonna be expected

07:07.093 --> 07:09.084
to say a few words
on behalf of your people.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.821
Sounds like you got
a big day ahead of you.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.127
You should probably
get some rest.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.604
All right, all right,
let's call it a night.

07:19.705 --> 07:20.763
Thank you.

07:23.543 --> 07:27.172
Do not underestimate
the power of the mind.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.841
The artifact was a catalyst for
your already active imagination.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.648
lt served as an unwelcome
reminder of your ancestry- -

07:34.720 --> 07:36.312
the self- loathing you experience

07:36.389 --> 07:39.620
when you look in the mirror
and see a Klingon.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.887
Who said anything
about self- loathing?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.622
You despise being Klingon.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.254
lt's no secret.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.162
What you experienced
in your quarters

07:47.233 --> 07:51.465
was a subconscious manifestation
of that hatred.

07:51.571 --> 07:57.373
The blood in your veins,
the voices of your ancestors- -

07:57.443 --> 07:59.741
all symbols
of your Klingon heritage.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.508
And when the blood
disappeared,

08:02.615 --> 08:03.775
that was, what?

08:03.816 --> 08:07.183
Me trying to vaporize
that part of myself?

08:07.253 --> 08:09.050
Yes.

08:09.121 --> 08:13.490
But the essence of who you are- - 
the artifact itself- - remained.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.356
And the moral of the story
is...?

08:15.428 --> 08:17.794
Quite simple.
That despite your efforts

08:17.864 --> 08:19.627
to become something else,

08:19.699 --> 08:22.190
whether it be Starfleet
or Maquis,

08:22.301 --> 08:25.361
your Klingon nature
continues to assert itself.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.632
That's an intriguing theory.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.402
Perhaps we should forego
your meditation

08:30.476 --> 08:32.602
in favor
of a different exercise.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.703
Fine by me.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.580
This should be interesting.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.644
Feel the weight of the bat'leth
in your hands.

08:45.458 --> 08:50.760
Describe the first thought
that enters your mind.

08:50.830 --> 08:54.732
lt's a clumsy weapon,
overstated,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.166
like everything else Klingon.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.738
You can't see the elegance
of its design,

08:59.805 --> 09:02.171
because of your hatred.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.108
l don't hate Klingons.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.975
lt's a warrior's blade...

09:07.046 --> 09:08.911
crafted for precision

09:08.981 --> 09:10.141
and balance.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.183
Observe.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.969
ls this your idea of therapy?!

09:32.038 --> 09:34.438
Listen to yourself whine
like a Ferengi.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.565
pahtk!

09:35.675 --> 09:37.802
You're not worthy
of the blood in your veins.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.778
A true Klingon would try
to kill me where l stand.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.279
What the hell
has gotten into you?

09:42.348 --> 09:45.249
This exercise is over.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.718
You are dismissed, Lieutenant,

09:47.787 --> 09:51.086
and take your dishonor
with you.

09:57.229 --> 10:01.165
...migh hohk- chew koo

10:01.267 --> 10:05.169

10:05.237 --> 10:08.172
And the blood was ankle- deep.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.732
ejdahk- so- TAS ghos
va Skral byteek...

10:11.844 --> 10:14.574
And the river Skral
ran crimson red.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.671
l fail to see the merit

10:15.748 --> 10:17.375
of learning a Klingon
drinking song.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.247
lt's not about drinking, Seven.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.845
lt's about saluting the noble
deeds of our ancestors

10:22.922 --> 10:25.755
and honoring those
who fell in battle.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.952
Think ''Qapla'!''

10:28.027 --> 10:30.825
Think ''Long live
the Empire!''

10:30.896 --> 10:32.124
Think again.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.825
Okay, so l'm overdoing it a bit,

10:33.899 --> 10:35.833
but try to get into the
spirit of the occasion.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.369
Very well.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.961
Ej lM- ta fey

Sop joq jiH yuv gagh drek!

11:01.961 --> 11:03.588
He said, ''Eat this

11:03.663 --> 11:06.188
or he'll force it down
the gullet of your corpse.''

11:06.265 --> 11:07.197
No offense.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.699
Oh, none taken.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.895
So this is replicated,
right?

11:12.004 --> 11:12.993
Unfortunately.

11:13.105 --> 11:17.371
And how do you get it to...
move?

11:17.443 --> 11:20.606
l used a kinesthetic agent
to give it a little oomph.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.808
ls it just me,

11:25.885 --> 11:28.581
or has everyone
gone Klingon- happy?

11:28.654 --> 11:29.951
Oh, come on, B'Elanna.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.819
They're all doing this for you.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.223
Well, then they don't
know me very well.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.386
And if you even think
of joining in

11:36.462 --> 11:38.123
on this ''embrace your heritage''
nonsense,

11:38.197 --> 11:41.223
l swear l'll rip out your tongue
and wear it as a belt.

11:41.300 --> 11:45.100
Oh, no... there's not
a lot of Klingon in you.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.732
l inherited the forehead and
the bad attitude- - that's it.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.376
She would have loved all this.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.849
Your mother?

11:59.952 --> 12:03.479
She was so obsessed
with Klingon ritual, myths.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.456
lt used to drive
my father and me crazy.

12:06.492 --> 12:11.054
Did l ever tell you that she
put me in a Klingon monastery?

12:11.130 --> 12:12.893
Ah. You're kidding.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.158
lt was after their marriage
ended.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.632
She pulled me
out of the Federation school

12:15.735 --> 12:20.138
in order to teach me...
honor and discipline.

12:20.206 --> 12:24.267
Hmm... out of the plasma cooker
into the fire.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.640
She prayed to Kahless every day

12:25.711 --> 12:27.338
to guide me in the ways
of the warrior.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.937
l guess he wasn't listening.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.846
Ladies and gentlemen, could l
have your attention, please?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.648
l hate to interrupt
the festivities,

12:35.721 --> 12:38.815
but before l turn the floor
over to our resident Klingon,

12:38.891 --> 12:42.622
l'd like to say a few words.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.720
This is a great day
for the Klingon Empire- -

12:44.797 --> 12:47.698
a day when we honor
their ancestors.

12:47.767 --> 12:53.831
Those warriors whose deeds
of valor and glory...

12:53.939 --> 12:56.464
led them to the Delta Quadrant.

12:56.575 --> 13:03.879
May they live on
in song and story.

13:35.514 --> 13:36.173
Captain!

13:50.830 --> 13:54.823
legh soH va Gre'thor!

14:11.016 --> 14:12.745
Where am l?

14:12.818 --> 14:14.342
Silence.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.719
The dead ask no questions.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.761
Computer, end program!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.804
Qem nuH meq!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.430
Let go of me!

14:41.013 --> 14:42.139
Wait... wait...

14:42.214 --> 14:43.306
'uch ghaH.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.974
Uh, wait...

14:54.260 --> 14:56.490
She won't take the mark.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.956
What the hell is going on?

15:00.032 --> 15:00.828
Qusdaq.

15:00.866 --> 15:01.890
ba'daH.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.428
mag hoshonaH nes'a.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.004
Where am l?

15:07.072 --> 15:10.838
You should know;
you're half Klingon.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.306
Enlighten me.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.712
This is the Barge of the Dead.

15:18.784 --> 15:22.811
Our dishonored souls are
being taken to Gre'thor.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.856
Klingon hell is a myth.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.983
That's what l thought- -

15:27.059 --> 15:30.051
just a foolish superstition.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.290
lmagine my surprise.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.198
But l was on Voyager
with my crew.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.895
That was the naj- -

15:39.038 --> 15:42.735
the dream before dying.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.935
When we can't accept
that we've died,

15:45.077 --> 15:47.045
we create the illusion of life

15:47.112 --> 15:49.080
to hold on to.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.954
He slaughtered my friends.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.822
No. He slaughtered the dream.

16:03.062 --> 16:06.156
He dragged you
from the illusion of life.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.162
This is where you belong.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.871
What is that?

16:20.946 --> 16:23.073
lt's the kos'kari.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.982
They'll try to lure you to them.
Don't listen.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.612
B'Elanna, are you there?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.282
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

16:33.359 --> 16:34.348
Help us find you!

16:34.426 --> 16:36.894
Tom? Chakotay?

16:36.962 --> 16:38.657
lt's not your friends!

16:39.631 --> 16:41.565
jiH qoy soH!

16:56.281 --> 16:59.648
There are things here
worse than death.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.415
You.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.522
ls this the mongrel
child you spoke of?

17:15.601 --> 17:18.262
Yes. The one whose face
would not bear the mark.

17:22.608 --> 17:27.704
B'Elanna, daughter of Miral...

17:27.780 --> 17:29.748
it's not your time.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.544
How do you know my name?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.084
You've come close

17:33.152 --> 17:35.586
to boarding this ship
many times.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.316
l remember the first.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.381
You were a child.

17:40.459 --> 17:43.394
Your mother took you
to the Sea of Gatan.

17:43.462 --> 17:46.989
Your curiosity was as deep
as the water.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.863
l fell in.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.925
l almost drowned.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.937
When your mother breathed life
back into your lungs

17:54.006 --> 17:55.598
she told you about me.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.505
So you're supposed to be Kortar.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.035
Ah... you remember me.

18:02.114 --> 18:06.210
l remember the myth of Kortar,
the first Klingon.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.617
He destroyed the gods
who created him.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.781
And as punishment,
l was condemned to ferry

18:11.857 --> 18:15.122
the souls of the dishonored
to Gre'thor.

18:19.398 --> 18:24.665
l may have believed in you
as a child, but not anymore.

18:24.770 --> 18:29.002
lf you didn't still believe,
you wouldn't be here.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.446
Foolish girl.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.343
You cannot harm me.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.387
l'm already dead.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.862
What's happening?

18:57.970 --> 19:02.464
The soul of another dishonored
warrior is being delivered.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.135
kot'mah soH Gre'thor!

19:07.212 --> 19:08.270
Qapla.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.352
Mother.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.825
lt's all right.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.827
You're safe.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.760
Your shuttle was drifting

19:30.869 --> 19:32.097
on the trailing edge
of an ion storm.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.193
You lost life support.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.795
We found you just in time.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.378
But l got through the storm.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.813
l remember
crashing into the Shuttle Bay.

19:44.883 --> 19:48.011
When we tractored your
shuttle back to Voyager,

19:48.086 --> 19:49.519
you were in a coma.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.249
We almost lost you.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.694
The Klingon artifact...

19:56.762 --> 19:58.024
Artifact?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.763
My hand...

20:07.005 --> 20:09.906
You took quite
a beating out there- -

20:09.975 --> 20:13.809
more than your fair share
of cuts and bruises.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.157
Come in.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.737
How are you feeling?

20:39.805 --> 20:42.706
Um... a little out of place.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.173
Would you like to talk about it?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.835
Yes...

20:45.911 --> 20:48.209
and no.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.149
Let me know when you decide.

20:52.217 --> 20:55.846
l don't know how to say this
without sounding crazy.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.424
Try.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.897
Do you believe in an afterlife?

21:10.002 --> 21:12.630
l accept there are
things in the universe

21:12.738 --> 21:15.263
than can't be scanned
with a tricorder.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.636
What happened to you out there?

21:20.846 --> 21:22.313
l think...

21:23.448 --> 21:24.915
l died.

21:24.983 --> 21:28.077
l died, and l was on
the Barge of the Dead,

21:28.153 --> 21:29.950
in the Klingon afterlife.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.217
Klingon mythology has
been ingrained in you

21:32.291 --> 21:33.553
since you were a child.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.684
lt's not surprising
you experienced some

21:35.761 --> 21:37.956
of those images while
you were unconscious.

21:38.096 --> 21:41.259
l saw my mother, Chakotay.

21:41.333 --> 21:45.292
lf it was real, then she's dead.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.871
B'Elanna...

21:46.938 --> 21:49.372
your mother...
the Barge of the Dead...

21:49.441 --> 21:52.342
these are just symbols.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.641
lt's your subconscious mind
trying to tell you something.

21:54.713 --> 21:55.975
Tell me what?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.948
That my mother is going to hell?

21:58.016 --> 22:00.416
You need time
to digest what you experienced.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.248
You have to interpret
the symbols

22:02.321 --> 22:03.879
and search for their meaning.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.186
What if there is no symbolism
to interpret?

22:07.259 --> 22:09.557
What if the afterlife is real?

22:09.628 --> 22:11.892
l'm an engineer.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.397
My whole life,
l've immersed myself

22:14.466 --> 22:16.730
in science and...
and schematics.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.327
But what if it's time
to start looking beyond that?

22:23.508 --> 22:26.102
My grandfather used to...

22:26.178 --> 22:28.772
think he could transform himself
into a wolf,

22:28.847 --> 22:32.305
so that he could venture out
to explore the spirit realm.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.284
lt was real to him.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.288
As real as what you experienced
was to you,

22:37.356 --> 22:40.951
but that doesn't mean
he grew hair all over his body

22:41.059 --> 22:43.027
and walked around on all fours.

22:50.569 --> 22:54.938
My mother has been
on my mind a lot lately.

22:55.006 --> 22:58.100
We just had a big anniversary.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.973
lt's been ten years...

23:00.946 --> 23:02.914
since we talked.

23:05.450 --> 23:08.544
But it was so real.

23:08.620 --> 23:12.386
l could taste the blood
in the air.

23:12.457 --> 23:15.893
l could feel the wind.

23:15.961 --> 23:19.226
l was seasick
from the rocking of the boat.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.800
Hi.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.411
Hi.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.413
What are you reading?

23:36.481 --> 23:37.743
The paq'batlh.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.580
lt's a sacred Klingon scroll.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.244
Find anything?

23:42.320 --> 23:45.414
You don't want to know.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.616
Oh, come on.

23:46.691 --> 23:47.851
lt can't be that bad.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.325
You want to bet?

23:50.695 --> 23:54.859
l found out why my mother
is on her way to Gre'thor.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.424
lt's because l sent her there.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.164
What do you mean?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.603
The sins of the child.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.609
She's being punished
for my dishonor.

24:05.677 --> 24:08.145
l turned my back
on everything Klingon,

24:08.213 --> 24:10.374
and now she has
to pay the price.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.508
B'Elanna, you can't even be sure

24:12.584 --> 24:15.553
your mother is dead,
much less blame yourself

24:15.620 --> 24:18.384
for what happens to her
in some afterlife.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.391
Look at this.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.984
The Eleventh Tome of Klavek.

24:23.061 --> 24:26.394
lt's a story about Kahless
returning from the dead...

24:26.465 --> 24:28.660
''still bearing a wound
from the afterlife''- -

24:28.733 --> 24:31.293
a warning that what
he experienced wasn't a dream.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.893
The same thing happened to me.

24:33.004 --> 24:33.936
B'Elanna, this...

24:34.005 --> 24:34.937
And the only reason

24:35.006 --> 24:36.940
Kahless was in the afterlife
to begin with

24:37.008 --> 24:38.999
was to rescue his brother
from the Barge of the Dead

24:39.110 --> 24:39.940
and deliver him to Sto- Vo- Kor.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.102
Okay.

24:41.179 --> 24:42.407
Don't you see?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.177
l have a chance
to rescue my mother

24:45.250 --> 24:48.913
if l can accept responsibility
for her dishonor

24:48.987 --> 24:52.787
before she passes through
the gates of Gre'thor.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.382
l have to go back.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.386
Whoa. Wait a minute.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.952
What do you mean, ''go back''?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.430
l can't let her suffer
for what l've done.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.536
lt's the only way.

25:05.604 --> 25:09.870
B'Elanna, l respect
what you believe in,

25:10.008 --> 25:13.535
but you're starting to scare me.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.580
l'm scaring myself.

25:18.483 --> 25:20.144
lt's a controlled procedure.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.879
l'll be under
constant supervision.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.751
The Doctor can simulate
the conditions of the ion storm.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.519
He's agreed to help me,
but only with your permission.

25:27.592 --> 25:30.527
l'm still not inclined
to grant your request.

25:31.596 --> 25:32.563
Are you telling me

25:32.631 --> 25:34.895
that l can't pursue
my spiritual beliefs?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.092
B'Elanna,
l'm not going to let you

25:36.201 --> 25:37.896
turn this into a debate
about freedom of worship.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.129
But that's what it is.

25:40.238 --> 25:41.865
There's a limit to how far

25:41.973 --> 25:45.101
l'll let religious practices go
aboard this ship.

25:45.176 --> 25:46.905
lf your belief system
required you

25:46.978 --> 25:48.673
to sacrifice a child
to your gods,

25:48.747 --> 25:50.271
l wouldn't allow that, either.

25:50.348 --> 25:51.610
That's an absurd example.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.311
You want to simulate
a near- death experience,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.718
so you can revisit
the Barge of Death,

25:56.788 --> 25:59.222
and you're telling me
what's absurd?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.656
Bottom line, B'Elanna- -

26:00.759 --> 26:03.159
l'm not going to let you
risk your life for this.

26:03.194 --> 26:04.422
Captain, please.

26:04.496 --> 26:05.963
Request denied.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.592
What l do with my own life
is one thing,

26:09.668 --> 26:12.569
but to know that l have
condemned my mother...

26:12.637 --> 26:14.002
that because of what l've done,
she's...

26:14.072 --> 26:16.540
l appreciate what you're
trying to say, B'Elanna,

26:16.608 --> 26:19.236
but whatever you experienced,
it wasn't real.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.211
lt doesn't matter
if you think it was real.

26:21.279 --> 26:22.576
lt was real to me.

26:27.452 --> 26:31.718
Whatever it was, it changed me.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.553
l can't ignore that.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.025
l need to confront
what's happened.

26:38.296 --> 26:40.423
l'm sorry.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.058
You know, you're just like her.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.193
Lieutenant?

26:45.303 --> 26:47.271
My mother.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.637
You're as dedicated
to Starfleet principles

26:49.708 --> 26:51.972
as she was to Klingon honor.

26:53.044 --> 26:56.480
l know that we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

26:56.548 --> 26:58.311
but despite our differences,

26:58.383 --> 27:00.510
you helped me
become a good officer

27:00.585 --> 27:02.746
and l'd like to think
that you're proud of me for it.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.254
l am.

27:05.357 --> 27:10.693
My mother never had the chance
to be proud of me.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.663
l'd like her to know me
the way you do.

27:20.205 --> 27:25.643
l don't want her to die
thinking of me as a disgrace.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.975
You have to let me do this.

27:31.583 --> 27:35.383
l can't believe the Captain
is allowing this.

27:35.453 --> 27:36.886
One minute, you're in a coma.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.048
The next, you're
a born- again Klingon?

27:39.124 --> 27:40.386
l- l just don't get it.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.823
l'm not sure l get it, either.

27:41.893 --> 27:43.827
l just know this is something
l have to do.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.157
There's got to be an easier way

27:45.230 --> 27:47.027
for you to explore
your spirituality.

27:47.098 --> 27:49.066
Go to church, or something?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.691
lt wouldn't be enough.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.770
Look, l'll read the scrolls.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.236
l'll learn Klingon.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.398
We'll figure this out...
together.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.738
Next time.

28:00.879 --> 28:03.313
l just hope
there is a next time.

28:03.381 --> 28:06.043
There will be.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.320
Report.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.821
l've examined the sensor logs

28:11.890 --> 28:13.323
from the shuttle mission.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.586
l should be able to re- create
the exact conditions

28:15.660 --> 28:17.491
that triggered
her near- death experience.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.530
Good. B'Elanna?

28:19.597 --> 28:21.326
l'm ready.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.737
Be careful.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.675
You'll have an hour to do
whatever it is you need to do.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.843
At the first sign of trouble,
we're bringing you out.

28:40.919 --> 28:41.886
Understood?

28:51.329 --> 28:53.058
Computer...

28:53.131 --> 28:56.328
erect an isolation field
around the Surgical Bay.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.368
Decrease oxygen concentration

28:58.436 --> 29:00.802
within the force field
by 27 percent.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.568
Begin ionizing
the enclosed atmosphere

29:04.609 --> 29:06.839
to 5,000 particles
per cubic meter.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.472
She's unconscious.

29:11.549 --> 29:12.811
Neural activity

29:12.884 --> 29:15.819
is decreasing to 87 percent...

29:15.887 --> 29:17.445
62 percent...

29:20.759 --> 29:22.158
Synaptic function is failing.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.161
Compensating.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.663
Neural activity is nominal.

29:26.731 --> 29:27.959
She's not breathing.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.260
She's still alive.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.302
Her lungs are taking in
just enough oxygen

29:31.369 --> 29:32.961
to keep her brain
from necrotizing.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.938
Qapla', B'Elanna.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.650
suS'ag Gre'thor qay.

31:01.226 --> 31:02.193
Mother.

31:04.462 --> 31:05.690
Stay away.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.788
You are an illusion.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.857
You're a kos'kari
trying to lure me away.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.095
Mother, it's me.

31:13.171 --> 31:14.263
lt's me.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.737
B'Elanna?

31:17.809 --> 31:18.969
No.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.609
Then you died as well?

31:23.681 --> 31:26.309
l've come to lift your dishonor.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.182
But you don't believe
in Sto- Vo- Kor.

31:29.254 --> 31:32.655
A lot's happened since
the last time l saw you.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.191
l've changed.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.285
Not enough.

31:37.362 --> 31:42.129
lt was you who brought
this damnation upon me.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.393
lf you hadn't
tried to, to force me

31:46.504 --> 31:47.971
to become a warrior...

31:48.139 --> 31:51.302
l tried to guide you
in the ways of a Klingon.

31:51.376 --> 31:52.934
You tried a little too hard.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.911
lf you had listened to me
when you were younger,

31:55.980 --> 31:57.971
we wouldn't be
on the Barge of the Dead.

31:58.049 --> 32:01.143
You were always running away.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.084
You drove me away...

32:03.154 --> 32:07.250
the same way you
drove away my father.

32:07.325 --> 32:10.886
He abandoned us.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.156
You pushed him to the point
where he couldn't bear

32:13.231 --> 32:17.361
to be around anything
Klingon... including me.

32:17.468 --> 32:21.427
l wanted to give you honor.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.939
And if you had understood that,

32:24.008 --> 32:28.502
l would not be
on my way to Gre'thor.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.080
We're on the Barge
of the Dead...

32:34.152 --> 32:36.882
and we're still having
the same argument

32:36.955 --> 32:38.889
we were having ten years ago.

32:40.358 --> 32:47.958
Look, if l have dishonored you,
l am truly sorry.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.260
Are you?

32:49.367 --> 32:52.336
You have too much anger
in your heart to be sorry.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.927
Oh, we don't have
time for this

32:54.038 --> 32:56.506
if we're going to perform
the transference.

32:56.607 --> 32:59.007
ls that how you intend
to lift my dishonor?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.475
By taking my place?

33:00.578 --> 33:01.510
Oh, don't worry.

33:01.546 --> 33:04.037
l have no intention
of being on this barge

33:04.115 --> 33:05.639
when it gets to Gre'thor.

33:05.717 --> 33:08.185
We've got just enough time
to perform the ritual

33:08.252 --> 33:09.844
before my crew
resuscitates me.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.116
Oh.

33:12.190 --> 33:15.853
l should have known
you'd choose the easy way.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.122
What are you talking about?

33:18.196 --> 33:21.996
Do you know the risks
l've taken to save you?

33:22.066 --> 33:25.900
You still understand nothing
about being a Klingon.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.302
l would rather face damnation

33:28.373 --> 33:31.308
with what little honor
you have left me

33:31.376 --> 33:33.901
than cheat my way
into Sto- Vo- Kor.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.387
There she is.
Bring them.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.525
The mongrel child has returned.

33:51.596 --> 33:54.622
l'm here to take
my mother's place.

33:54.699 --> 33:55.825
B'Elanna!

33:55.900 --> 33:58.733
You wish to claim
her dishonor as your own?

33:58.836 --> 33:59.768
Yes.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.771
You're willing to die for her?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.135
Yes.
Release her to Sto- Vo- Kor.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.139
No!

34:04.208 --> 34:04.867
Keep her quiet!

34:04.976 --> 34:05.874
Silence!

34:05.977 --> 34:07.535
lt's not your decision.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.638
She has the right
to reclaim your honor.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.306
Once we
have reached Gre'thor

34:12.382 --> 34:15.614
and you are within its gates,
l will release her.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.516
No. Now.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.860
You're very impatient.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.293
Time must be slipping away
in the living world.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.491
You're concerned that
your friends will revive you

34:28.565 --> 34:30.591
before you complete
your deception.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.636
Did you really think
l could be fooled so easily?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.141
l will die for her.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.145
No tricks,

34:42.213 --> 34:43.202
no games.

34:43.281 --> 34:46.545
l will take her place honorably.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.313
Like a Klingon.

34:50.388 --> 34:53.118
lf you choose this path,

34:53.190 --> 34:55.351
your friends
will not be able to save you.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.951
No! l forbid it!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.996
l understand.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.540
Your dishonor has been lifted.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.873
Sto- Vo- Kor awaits you.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.981
l will not abandon my daughter.

35:18.049 --> 35:20.677
She has made the choice. Go!

35:31.229 --> 35:33.390
Daughter of Miral,

35:33.464 --> 35:36.024
embrace your fate.

35:49.514 --> 35:50.674
Vih.

36:06.030 --> 36:08.055
Her neural patterns
are breaking down.

36:08.132 --> 36:09.997
l'm initiating
emergency resuscitation.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.728
Vent the ionized particles.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.255
20 milligrams cordrazine now!

36:33.324 --> 36:35.224
l'm deactivating
the force field.

37:03.988 --> 37:06.650
Welcome to Gre'thor.

37:13.097 --> 37:14.758
This isn't Gre'thor.

37:14.832 --> 37:15.821
Oh, l assure you it is.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.366
You've taken your mark.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.572
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

37:21.639 --> 37:24.472
This is no laughing matter.

37:24.542 --> 37:25.668
You've met Mr. Neelix,

37:25.743 --> 37:28.712
our Ambassador
to the recently deceased.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.306
Questions, comments,
suggestions... he's your man.

37:32.383 --> 37:33.577
lf you'll follow me.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.781
By the way,
l'll be performing an aria

37:37.855 --> 37:38.787
from Berlioz's Faust

37:38.856 --> 37:40.881
tomorrow night in Holodeck 2.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.583
Feel free to stop by.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.890
15 decks.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.193
Computers augmented
with bio- neural circuitry.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.530
Top cruising speed:
warp 9.97 5.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.899
Not that you'll
be going anywhere.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.901
No Fek'lhr?
No Cavern of Despair?

37:54.972 --> 37:55.939
Don't need them.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.439
l don't consider Voyager hell!

37:58.509 --> 37:59.498
Are you sure?

37:59.610 --> 38:01.669
Have you ever been
truly happy here?

38:01.779 --> 38:04.179
lf you thought 50
years aboard this ship

38:04.215 --> 38:06.206
would be difficult,
try eternity.

38:17.528 --> 38:20.019
This is a great day
for B'Elanna Torres,

38:20.097 --> 38:23.362
a day when we pay tribute
to her dishonor.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.560
She's not responding
to the cordrazine.

38:25.670 --> 38:29.697
Neural activity
at 48 percent... 37.

38:29.807 --> 38:30.774
We're losing her.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.275
We have to stabilize
her synaptic functions.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.744
l'm attempting
a direct neural resequencing.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.748
B'Elanna's misdeeds
have led her to Gre'thor.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.307
She comes with no valor,
no glory...

38:41.385 --> 38:44.445
nothing to celebrate
in song and story.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.320
You really have no one
to blame but yourself.

38:47.391 --> 38:48.881
You've kept us all
at arm's length,

38:48.993 --> 38:50.893
even Tom, who you claim to love.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.121
Here, here.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.185
l tried to assist you

38:53.264 --> 38:54.788
in making Engineering
more efficient,

38:54.865 --> 38:56.992
but you resisted.
You're stubborn.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.626
She inherited that from her
mother along with the forehead.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.602
What do you think
of the afterlife so far?

39:01.706 --> 39:04.072
lt's not exactly
what l had in mind.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.370
Are you interpreting
all the symbols?

39:05.443 --> 39:08.412
Searching your subconscious
for their meaning?

39:08.479 --> 39:09.969
Lieutenant Torres...

39:10.047 --> 39:11.878
defend yourself.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.017
Captain?

39:25.062 --> 39:27.189
What are you still doing here?

39:27.264 --> 39:29.562
l've released you to Sto- Vo- Kor.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.124
You can't free me
until you free yourself.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.068
l don't understand.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.469
You never did.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.871
l did everything
that the ritual told me to do.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.134
l came back for you...

39:39.210 --> 39:40.677
Forget the ritual.

39:40.778 --> 39:42.245
lt's meaningless.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.803
Meaningless?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.815
l died for you.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.214
No, you didn't.

39:47.284 --> 39:49.013
lt's not your time.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.647
You still
don't understand this journey.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.281
Then tell me.

39:54.358 --> 39:56.883
Request denied.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.656
What do you want?

39:58.729 --> 40:00.492
Who are you asking?

40:00.564 --> 40:02.623
You, Kahless, the tooth fairy!

40:02.700 --> 40:06.158
Anybody who will tell me
what l am supposed to do!

40:06.237 --> 40:09.832
You are the only one
who can answer that question.

40:12.109 --> 40:15.374
Choose to live, B'Elanna.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.648
Neural activity's at 23 percent.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.461
Come on, B'Elanna.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.575
Defend yourself.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.842
You want me to fight?

40:49.914 --> 40:52.849
You want me to be
a good little Klingon?

40:54.985 --> 40:56.475
ls that it?

40:56.554 --> 40:58.317
You've let your anger
consume you.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.549
Now it's consuming us.

40:59.623 --> 41:00.783
She has condemned us all.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.654
Misery loves company.

41:02.693 --> 41:04.058
Get away from me!

41:04.128 --> 41:05.060
Or what?

41:05.129 --> 41:07.859
You'll kill us where we stand?

41:07.932 --> 41:10.696
Tell me what you want me to be!

41:10.801 --> 41:13.292
A good Starfleet officer?

41:13.404 --> 41:14.871
A good Maquis?

41:14.972 --> 41:16.906
Lover?

41:16.974 --> 41:20.171
Daughter?

41:20.244 --> 41:22.508
Just tell me
what you want from me!

41:22.580 --> 41:25.378
We don't want anything
from you, B'Elanna.

41:25.449 --> 41:26.939
We only want you.

41:27.017 --> 41:28.450
We're not your enemies.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.918
Defend yourself.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.917
l don't know how.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.961
l am so tired of fighting.

41:38.095 --> 41:39.027
We know.

42:01.085 --> 42:04.077
You've taken the first step
of your journey.

42:05.789 --> 42:07.416
And what about you?

42:07.491 --> 42:10.722
We will see each other again.

42:10.794 --> 42:14.127
ln Sto- Vo- Kor?

42:14.198 --> 42:17.133
Yes, in Sto- Vo- Kor.

42:17.234 --> 42:21.466
Or maybe... when you get home.

42:26.944 --> 42:28.138
Mother?

42:40.824 --> 42:44.282
Oh, God, l'm alive.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.663
