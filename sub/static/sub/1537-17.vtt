Gregor Minsk, the counterfeiter
I've been chasing

00:05.307 --> 00:07.441
for two years,
has finally resurfaced.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.276
And he's just as evil as ever.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.712
Right. You hate him
because he has a typo

00:11.713 --> 00:13.114
on his counterfeit bills.

00:13.148 --> 00:15.416
No.
Because he passed $4 million

00:15.417 --> 00:17.785
in fraudulent bills, Jake.

00:17.819 --> 00:20.054
But also, two Rs in "pluribus?"

00:20.055 --> 00:21.989
I mean, did none of those
cashiers take Latin?

00:21.990 --> 00:24.325
Okay, let's give Amy
a round of applause

00:24.326 --> 00:25.651
for whatever that was.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.495

Still in progress.

00:27.496 --> 00:28.696
And you did great.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.631

that is not in your toast.

It's not.

00:49.041 --> 00:50.251
Come on, man.

00:50.285 --> 00:53.087
Look, I need everything
to be perfect.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.822
Status update, Rosa.

00:54.823 --> 00:55.956
How are the flowers?

00:55.991 --> 00:57.425
I don't know.

00:57.426 --> 00:59.093
Yellow.
Terr-bear?

00:59.094 --> 01:00.428
I had my tuxedo altered

01:00.429 --> 01:01.896
to make it tighter
like you wanted.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.297
Delicious.

01:03.298 --> 01:05.766
Jake, have you checked in
with the jeweler?

01:05.767 --> 01:07.034
Yes.
They said the ring

01:07.035 --> 01:08.502
will be ready at 2:00
on the wedding day.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.304
I'm gonna pick it up
on my way to the ceremony.

01:10.339 --> 01:11.839
This is very important, Jake.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.307
Are you sure you can handle it?

01:13.342 --> 01:14.608
Uh, well, let's see.

01:14.609 --> 01:16.977
Easy, last-minute,

01:16.978 --> 01:18.646

"I love you."

03:26.642 --> 03:28.009
I mean, what am I
supposed to do then?

03:28.010 --> 03:29.810
Say "I love you" back?

03:29.811 --> 03:31.646
I've only said "I love you"
to three people.

03:31.647 --> 03:33.481
My mom, my dad,
and my dying grandpa.

03:33.482 --> 03:34.615

Grandpa.

Well, someone's
getting in that cage.

03:47.329 --> 03:50.264

my mom's priest dropped out,

04:09.484 --> 04:11.152

04:11.153 --> 04:13.187

You tailored the ceremony

04:13.188 --> 04:15.556
to the bride
and groom's interests.

04:15.557 --> 04:18.659
Yeah. Yeah.
That's totally what I was doing.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.161
I mean, working out
is not the only thing

04:20.161 --> 04:22.129
I feel comfortable
talking about.

04:22.130 --> 04:25.333
Uh, what would you say is your
mom's favorite move at the gym?

04:25.334 --> 04:28.569
My mom likes champagne,
baked ziti, the Bahamas.

04:28.570 --> 04:31.472
Charles's dad probably lives
under a bridge

04:31.473 --> 04:33.574

04:33.575 --> 04:35.643
I don't know.
You figure it out.

04:36.745 --> 04:37.979
Okay.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.514
I got the ring.
Let's go.

04:39.515 --> 04:42.550
Okay, thanks.

No.

04:44.319 --> 04:46.053

She spotted my counterfeiter

04:46.054 --> 04:47.822
four blocks from here.
We have to go check it out.

the wedding early

04:49.558 --> 04:51.692
and reserve a seat so Jenny
can sit on my right side.

04:51.693 --> 04:53.027

04:53.028 --> 04:54.896
and it turns out
this is my juicier duct.

04:54.897 --> 04:57.498
Please? I've been chasing
this guy for two years.

04:57.499 --> 04:58.900
What if it was your collar?

04:58.901 --> 05:00.201
I would have caught him
nine months ago

05:00.202 --> 05:02.170
in a shootout on top
of a ferris wheel.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.672
Minsk is my nemesis.

05:04.673 --> 05:06.574
He's my Eddie Fung.

05:06.575 --> 05:07.842
Fung.

05:07.843 --> 05:09.043
All right, that I understand.

05:09.044 --> 05:10.344
We'll check out your lead,

05:10.345 --> 05:11.546
then we'll go to the wedding.

05:11.547 --> 05:13.681
Let's go find Eddie Fung.

05:13.682 --> 05:15.583
Minsk.
Right. Minsk.

05:15.584 --> 05:17.251
Fung.

05:17.286 --> 05:20.988
Oh, Regina, everything is
so beautiful.

05:21.023 --> 05:23.224
Well, as long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

05:23.258 --> 05:24.859
(Charles)
Rosa, ah, there you are.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.627
Can you help my dad
with his cuff links?

05:26.628 --> 05:28.629
Sure.
I would do it, but it's bad luck

05:28.630 --> 05:30.372
for a boy to see his father
on his wedding day.

05:30.399 --> 05:31.866
Oh, well, in that case, no.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.135
Rosa, please.
It's a slippery slope

05:34.136 --> 05:36.304
from uncuffed sleeves
to Lynn just wearing

05:36.305 --> 05:38.372
an old turtleneck
down the aisle.

05:38.373 --> 05:40.942
Actually, my dad
can really rock a turtleneck.

05:40.943 --> 05:43.311
Gives him a sexy
Elliott Gould vibe.

05:43.345 --> 05:44.645
Charles, shut up.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.115
Rosa, go find Lynn Boyle
and cuff his ass.

05:47.149 --> 05:49.283
There you go.
Thanks. [chuckles]

05:49.284 --> 05:51.119
You nervous?
Oh, not at all.

05:51.153 --> 05:54.388
I love Darlene Linetti
with all my parts.

05:54.389 --> 05:56.257
Wow.
I can't ever imagine

05:56.258 --> 05:58.126
being with someone
and not having any doubts.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.660
I have little doubts.

05:59.661 --> 06:01.129
Tiny little doubts.

06:01.130 --> 06:02.830
You think that's a problem?

06:02.831 --> 06:04.332
I mean, not if you're sure
she's the one.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.767
Yes.
Of course.

06:05.768 --> 06:08.102
But I was sure about
my five other weddings, too.

06:08.103 --> 06:10.271
[chuckles]
Please, don't tell Charles.

06:10.272 --> 06:12.507

about three.

That's okay.

06:18.747 --> 06:20.782
Just took you a while
to get it right.

06:20.783 --> 06:23.484
Yeah, or maybe I'm just
doing the same thing

06:23.485 --> 06:25.586
over and over again.
[chuckles]

06:25.587 --> 06:28.723
Lynn Boyle rushes headlong
into another mistake.

06:28.757 --> 06:30.591
Like that time
I tried water aerobics

06:30.592 --> 06:34.295
and I broke my neck.

06:34.296 --> 06:35.830
This is a disaster.

06:35.831 --> 06:37.932
All right, I'm gonna
go get Charles.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.101
I wonder what Jenny Gildenhorn
will be wearing tonight.

06:40.102 --> 06:41.536
Do you think she'll be in her
high school

06:41.537 --> 06:43.438
field hockey uniform?
That'd be crazy, right?

06:43.439 --> 06:45.740
Yes, it'd be crazy if that's
what she wears to a wedding.

06:45.741 --> 06:47.108
Yeah, you're right.

06:47.142 --> 06:49.911
Ah, well, I hate to say it,
but there's no sign of Minsk.

06:49.945 --> 06:51.946
We should really get going.
Jenny awaits.

06:51.947 --> 06:53.956
Oh, my God.
Look!

06:53.982 --> 06:55.550
Fung.
Minsk!

06:55.551 --> 06:56.951
Right, Minsk.
I know it's Minsk.

06:56.952 --> 06:58.364
Let's go!

07:01.729 --> 07:03.063
Clear.

07:03.064 --> 07:04.397
He's gotta be in here somewhere.

07:04.398 --> 07:06.833
Clear.

07:06.834 --> 07:09.402
I love this.
Tux on, gun out.

07:09.403 --> 07:10.904
I feel like James Bond

07:10.905 --> 07:12.806
and you're my mysterious
femme fatale

07:12.807 --> 07:15.909
that I've been
partnered with, Maxi Pads.

07:15.943 --> 07:17.477
Maxi Pads?
I don't know!

07:17.478 --> 07:18.745
I didn't want to make
the name too sexual

07:18.746 --> 07:19.846
and I panicked!

07:22.650 --> 07:24.319
Clear.
If we catch this guy

07:24.352 --> 07:26.152
in the next 15 minutes,
we can still make the wedding.

07:26.153 --> 07:28.355
So what's your opening line
gonna be with Jenny Gildenhorn?

07:28.389 --> 07:30.924
I was thinking I'd go with,
"Jamie Gordenhorn?"

07:30.925 --> 07:32.526
You know, make it seem like
I haven't been staring at her

07:32.527 --> 07:34.094
on the Internet
for the past 20 years.

07:34.095 --> 07:36.463
Or you could call her
by her real name.

07:36.464 --> 07:38.331
Girls like that.
I don't know.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.433
I think girls like
being deceived.

07:40.434 --> 07:42.369
No?
Okay.

07:43.771 --> 07:45.605
Clear.

07:45.606 --> 07:48.275
So, you're really okay with me
and Jenny Gildenhorn, huh?

07:48.276 --> 07:49.342
Totally.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.477
Stuff with us is in the past.

07:50.478 --> 07:52.045
We talked about that.
I know.

07:52.046 --> 07:54.147
But that was before you
saw me in this dope-ass tux.

07:54.148 --> 07:55.515
I mean, you must be
freaking out.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.451
Oh, I am.
I'm really into rented clothes.

07:58.452 --> 07:59.786
I love how many butts
have been in them.

07:59.787 --> 08:01.354
I know you're making fun of me,

08:01.355 --> 08:03.123
but that sexy voice
is kinda getting me going.

08:03.124 --> 08:05.659
But more importantly, this is
a fancy outfit, all right?

08:05.660 --> 08:07.227
I sprang for the
three button jacket.

08:07.228 --> 08:08.895
It was $8 extra.

08:08.896 --> 08:10.897
He's heading for the alley.

08:13.467 --> 08:17.370
Whoa, hey.
Dad, it's your son under here.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.572
Charles Boyle.

08:18.573 --> 08:20.473
Rosa said you had
a personal question.

08:20.508 --> 08:22.742
No, I'm not. I'm not.
I'm just second-guessing

08:22.743 --> 08:24.744
every decision I ever made.

08:24.745 --> 08:27.080
Oh, my God, why did I buy
a cube-shaped car?

08:27.081 --> 08:29.516
Because you love it. Dad, listen...
Oh!

08:29.517 --> 08:31.918
Let's just sit down...
Oh!

08:31.919 --> 08:33.919
Screw a 2,000-year-old
tradition.

08:33.921 --> 08:37.157
I'm taking the bag off.

08:37.191 --> 08:39.259
[gasps] Okay, Dad, listen.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.328
Everyone gets nervous.
Everyone gets cold feet.

08:41.328 --> 08:43.663
I was nervous
before I married Eleanor.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.165
She ended up cheating on you

08:45.166 --> 08:46.867
with the guy from
the mattress commercials.

08:46.868 --> 08:48.835
Sleepy Stu?
Don't bring up Sleepy Stu.

08:48.836 --> 08:50.537
Rosa thinks I should
call off the wedding.

08:50.538 --> 08:51.838
That is not what I said.

08:51.839 --> 08:53.206
This is why I don't talk
to people.

08:53.207 --> 08:54.508
I just asked him
if he was feeling nervous.

08:54.542 --> 08:57.677
Rosa, you know how suggestible
Boyle men are.

08:57.678 --> 08:59.513
I saw one Samuel L. Jackson
movie,

08:59.514 --> 09:02.082
and I work a Kangol hat
for three years.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.184
Ah!
There has been a mix-up

09:04.185 --> 09:06.720
and the caterer has cooked
one of the doves,

09:06.721 --> 09:09.389
so I need some good news.

09:09.390 --> 09:10.590
How is that speech going?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.758
Do you want to hear it?
Yes.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.460
"Darlene and Lynn,

09:13.461 --> 09:17.130
"I want you to remember
the words of Luther Vandross:

09:17.131 --> 09:22.769
"'A thousand kisses from you...

09:22.770 --> 09:26.273
[voice cracking]
"'A thousand kisses from you

09:26.274 --> 09:29.442
"'is never too much...'"

09:29.443 --> 09:30.911
Every time he reads it,
he breaks down.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.146
I thought you had
done this before.

09:33.147 --> 09:35.715
Well, yeah, but that was just
workout metaphors.

09:35.716 --> 09:37.184
You told me to get gorgeous
with it,

09:37.185 --> 09:39.452
and it took me to some
very real places.

09:39.487 --> 09:42.088
Terry, I'm sorry,
but you're fired.

09:42.089 --> 09:43.690
Captain, the speech is yours.

09:43.724 --> 09:46.993
It needs to be emotional
and poetic.

09:46.994 --> 09:47.993
Can you do it?

09:47.995 --> 09:49.262
Well, my first Captain

09:49.263 --> 09:51.631
used to call me Emily Dickinson.

09:51.666 --> 09:53.366
Great.

09:53.401 --> 09:55.869
Of course, he meant it as
an insult about my sexuality,

09:55.870 --> 09:57.304
but don't worry.

09:57.338 --> 10:00.307
I am good at emotion.

10:04.245 --> 10:07.414
NYPD!
We know you're here, Minsk!

10:07.415 --> 10:09.216
Freeze!

10:09.250 --> 10:11.184
Hey!
[grunts]

10:16.357 --> 10:19.960
Gregor Minsk,
you're under arrest.

10:19.961 --> 10:21.394
Oh!

10:21.395 --> 10:22.696
I can't let Jenny see me
like this.

10:22.697 --> 10:23.730
I ripped my cummerbund.

10:23.764 --> 10:24.898
It's okay.
I have an extra one.

10:24.899 --> 10:26.366
You can borrow it.

10:26.367 --> 10:29.035
From my high school
jazz band uniform.

10:29.036 --> 10:30.103
I'm only gonna tell you this

10:30.104 --> 10:31.705
because you were
a great partner today.

10:31.706 --> 10:32.839
Uh-huh?

10:32.840 --> 10:36.009
I played French horn.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.043
I still do.

10:37.078 --> 10:41.851
Oh, whaaaaaaaaat?

10:43.584 --> 10:45.619
The guests are all here
and nothing is ready.

10:45.653 --> 10:48.722
We don't have a ring, the cake
says, "Darlene and Lunn,"

10:48.723 --> 10:50.290
and the smoke machine
is not working.

10:50.324 --> 10:52.459
I could crouch by the altar
and vape.

10:52.493 --> 10:54.694
You are a stone-cold atrocity.

10:54.729 --> 10:58.398
Okay, we just need to make sure
nothing else goes wrong.

10:58.432 --> 10:59.432
Charles...
Hmm?

10:59.433 --> 11:01.568
Where is your dad?
Where is Lunn?

11:01.602 --> 11:03.937
Um, he's still having a little
trouble with his cuff links.

11:03.938 --> 11:06.439
You know us Boyle men
and our clumsy ham hands.

11:06.474 --> 11:07.941
Please say you're not
gonna reference

11:07.942 --> 11:09.376
your ham hands in your toast.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.611
Well, you made me take out
the brother-sister sex stuff,

11:11.612 --> 11:13.613
so there was this big hole
on page 18.

11:13.648 --> 11:15.248
Page 18?
Made it!

11:15.249 --> 11:17.817
Made it in time.
Ew, Amy!

11:17.852 --> 11:19.619
Your dress is filthy.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.155
Luckily I brought you a spare outfit.
Hmm?

11:22.156 --> 11:23.590
I knew I was gonna hate
whatever you chose.

11:23.624 --> 11:25.659
Oh, my God.
It's Jenny.

11:25.693 --> 11:27.827
She's here.
Okay, how do I look?

11:27.862 --> 11:29.963
You look great.
Go get her, Bond.

11:29.997 --> 11:33.633
Thanks, Maxi Pads.

11:33.668 --> 11:35.235
Jenny Gildenhorn?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.536
I didn't know you were
coming to this.

11:36.537 --> 11:38.572
Jake Peralta?
Yeah.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.839
Oh, my God.
How are you?

11:39.840 --> 11:41.274
I'm good.
I'm good.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.509
Wow.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.044
Oh, sorry I'm
a little bit ruffled.

11:44.045 --> 11:46.513
I arrested a very dangerous
counterfeiter on my way here.

11:46.514 --> 11:47.747
Ah, look at that.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.508
One of my three jacket buttons
is unbuttoned.

11:49.517 --> 11:50.917
Must have happened
during the fight.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.819
That's embarrassing.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.455
Hey, I don't know anyone here.
Want to sit together?

11:55.489 --> 11:57.257
Uh, yes, I would.

11:57.291 --> 11:58.825
After you.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.327
Uh, Jake, wait!

12:00.328 --> 12:02.095
What are you doing?
Give me the ring.

12:02.129 --> 12:03.496
[chuckles]
You sound like Gollum.

12:03.531 --> 12:05.532
That means nothing to me.
I don't see those movies.

12:05.533 --> 12:06.800
I'm too pretty.
Okay.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.101
Well, not to worry.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.669
I've got the ring right here.

12:09.670 --> 12:10.971
Nope.
Those are my mints.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.172
I eat mints.
No big deal.

12:12.206 --> 12:15.942
Um... uh-huh...

12:15.943 --> 12:16.977
I lost the ring.

12:16.978 --> 12:18.597
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.047
I must have dropped the ring

12:21.048 --> 12:22.598
somewhere around here
during the takedown.

12:22.599 --> 12:24.601
I'm so stupid!
No, it's my fault.

12:24.602 --> 12:25.768
I made us go after Minsk.

12:25.769 --> 12:26.903
Please don't climb in here.

12:26.904 --> 12:28.071
I don't want you
smelling like garbage

12:28.072 --> 12:29.839
for your slow-dance
with Jenny Gildenhorn.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.074
Oh, don't worry.
The only thing

12:31.075 --> 12:33.042
I'm gonna smell like
is the Jason Priestly cologne

12:33.043 --> 12:34.310
I wore in middle school.

12:34.311 --> 12:37.113
It's just called "Brandon,"
and it is overpowering.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.048
[gasps] Jake! Look!

12:39.083 --> 12:40.783
Oh, my God!
You found it!

12:40.784 --> 12:41.783
And you're on one knee.

12:41.785 --> 12:43.887
Are you proposing?
Yes.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.055
Will you, Jacob Peralta,
accept this ring

12:46.056 --> 12:48.625
and bring it with me to our
weird friends' parents' wedding?

12:48.659 --> 12:50.927
Yes.
A thousand times, yes!

12:50.961 --> 12:52.662
Oh!

12:52.663 --> 12:54.264
[grunts] Tight.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.099
Yeah, it's so tight, dawg.

12:56.133 --> 12:59.135
And no, I mean the ring
is actually tight.

12:59.136 --> 13:00.470
[grunts] Amy, it's stuck.

13:00.471 --> 13:02.505
The ring is stuck.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:02.506 --> 13:04.073
Let me try.
We have to get this off.

13:04.108 --> 13:05.608
Jenny's gonna think I'm married.

13:05.643 --> 13:08.444
Also it'll ruin
Lynn and Darlene's wedding.

13:08.479 --> 13:09.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's just us here.

13:09.847 --> 13:11.614
You don't have to pretend
like you care about them.

13:11.649 --> 13:14.450
Okay.
Jake has the ring.

13:14.485 --> 13:16.820
I found an extra place setting
for your psychic.

13:16.854 --> 13:19.189
Strange, she said
you wouldn't be able to.

13:19.223 --> 13:20.490
Because she's a fraud.

13:20.491 --> 13:22.358
You need to start seeing
my psychic.

13:22.393 --> 13:26.162
Best of all, I fixed this!

13:26.163 --> 13:28.131
(Charles) It's working!
How'd you do that?

13:28.132 --> 13:30.800
I grew up with a smoke machine
in the apartment, Charles.

13:30.801 --> 13:33.937
I liked to enter the kitchen
in the morning with vivacity.

13:33.971 --> 13:36.339
Regina, you're amazing.
Everything's just perfect.

13:36.373 --> 13:40.276
Thank you for making this
the third-best day of my life.

13:40.311 --> 13:41.477
Third?

13:41.512 --> 13:42.512
First was having you.

13:42.546 --> 13:44.547
Second was sleeping
with a roadie

13:44.582 --> 13:45.849
for the Steve Miller Band.

13:45.883 --> 13:47.717
(Charles) Oh!
I love you, Mom.

13:47.751 --> 13:49.052
I love you.
I love you.

13:49.086 --> 13:50.486
[both smooching]

13:50.487 --> 13:52.422
Grab some of those
if you're throwing 'em out.

13:52.423 --> 13:54.724
Mwah! [grunts] Mwah!

13:54.758 --> 13:56.960
My mom.
[clears throat]

13:56.994 --> 13:58.461
You did so great.

13:58.495 --> 14:01.130
I, however, hit a small snag.

14:01.165 --> 14:02.866
[sobbing]

14:02.933 --> 14:04.701
No!
Do not take off that tux, Lynn

14:04.735 --> 14:06.736
What are you doing?
We had a deal.

14:06.737 --> 14:08.438
I said, "If you hurt my mother,

14:08.472 --> 14:10.440
I will cut off
your son's testicles."

14:10.441 --> 14:12.342
You're right.
Cut 'em off!

14:12.376 --> 14:13.743
No!
Okay.

14:13.744 --> 14:15.578
As much as I would love
to do that,

14:15.579 --> 14:17.313
I would like my mom to be happy.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.249
So can you please have a seat?
Mm-hmm.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.851
And just explain to me
what is going on.

14:21.852 --> 14:24.454
I'm worried I'm just
rushing into this.

14:24.455 --> 14:25.955
I barely know your mom.

14:25.956 --> 14:28.524
I don't even know
her favorite kind of soup.

14:28.525 --> 14:29.692
Is it tomato?

14:29.727 --> 14:32.028
Nobody likes soup, Lynn.

14:32.029 --> 14:34.230
You're a family of soup-haters.

14:34.231 --> 14:36.232
What have I done?
Look.

14:36.233 --> 14:39.269
Do you know
why my mom loves you?

14:39.270 --> 14:41.371
Because you take big risks.

14:41.405 --> 14:43.740
<i>Like how you got her that dog
on your second date.</i>

14:43.774 --> 14:44.941
[chuckles] Those kind of things

14:44.942 --> 14:47.210
just blow up in my face
half the time.

14:47.211 --> 14:48.912
I mean, the dog
worked out great, but...

14:48.946 --> 14:51.080
The dog was a disaster.
She hates it.

14:51.115 --> 14:53.283
But she loved that you took
that shot.

14:53.317 --> 14:56.853
Do you know who never,
ever rushes into anything?

14:56.887 --> 14:59.422
Cowards.

14:59.423 --> 15:01.457
That's exactly right, Rosa.

15:01.492 --> 15:04.794
Cowards.
And you're a weirdo.

15:04.828 --> 15:06.696
I'd call you a hobbit...
Yeah.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.965
A human pile of mashed potatoes...
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:08.966 --> 15:11.234
But you are no coward,
Lynn Boyle.

15:11.268 --> 15:13.403
Lynn Linetti.
I'm taking your mother's name.

15:13.437 --> 15:15.572
Oh!
You're making this hard.

15:15.573 --> 15:18.074
My mom loves you.
You love her.

15:18.108 --> 15:20.410
Now follow your big,
weird heart.

15:20.444 --> 15:22.612
Oh, you're right.

15:22.613 --> 15:25.548
It's time for a wedding!

15:25.549 --> 15:27.283
Pants, Dad!
Pants!

15:27.284 --> 15:29.085
A wedding with pants!
Yeah.

15:29.119 --> 15:31.454
Wedding's starting soon.
How are things going?

15:31.455 --> 15:36.125
I was just ordained at
www.internetministry4cheap.com,

15:36.160 --> 15:37.927
but I'm having some trouble
with my speech.

15:37.962 --> 15:39.562
All I've got so far is a poem.

15:39.597 --> 15:42.632
Ooh, a poem.
Sounds romantic.

15:42.666 --> 15:46.903
"Marriage is a contract
between two adults

15:46.904 --> 15:50.707
of different families."

15:50.708 --> 15:53.610
It's a haiku...
and a fact.

15:53.611 --> 15:54.911
It works on two levels.

15:54.945 --> 15:57.513
Uh, it feels
a little impersonal.

15:57.548 --> 15:59.649
What did the officiant say
when you got married?

15:59.683 --> 16:01.851
Not much.
When gay marriage was legalized,

16:01.852 --> 16:03.686
we weren't sure if or when it
was gonna be struck down,

16:03.687 --> 16:05.989
so speed was of the essence.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.924
Do you, Kevin...
Yes.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.193
And do you...
Yes, yes, we do!

16:10.194 --> 16:11.261
We're married!

16:11.295 --> 16:12.829
I remarked afterwards

16:12.830 --> 16:16.466
that I wished the <i> officiant</i>
had been more <i> efficient.</i>

16:16.500 --> 16:18.601
[chuckles] It was very funny.

16:18.636 --> 16:20.003
Kevin still talks about it.

16:20.037 --> 16:22.205
Aha! Maybe I should open
with that zinger.

16:22.239 --> 16:25.508
It is amazingly funny.
Oh.

16:25.509 --> 16:28.678
I'm just not sure this
is the right crowd for it.

16:28.712 --> 16:30.413
No zinger?
No haiku?

16:30.414 --> 16:34.183
Then I have nothing.
Maybe I should wing it.

16:34.184 --> 16:39.322
Love: It sustains you.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.891
It's like... oatmeal.

16:41.926 --> 16:45.194
Okay, okay.
Not bad for winging it.

16:45.229 --> 16:46.663
I lied.

16:46.664 --> 16:48.231
Took me two hours to write that.

16:50.234 --> 16:51.233
How do I look?
Oh!

16:51.235 --> 16:53.036
You look incredible!

16:53.037 --> 16:54.938
Up high!
Down low!

16:54.939 --> 16:57.006
(both) Butts, butts, butts.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.508
You're the worst family
in history,

16:58.509 --> 16:59.676
but at least you're ready.

16:59.677 --> 17:01.277
Scully's run out of songs.

17:01.278 --> 17:02.612
Right now, he's singing.

17:02.613 --> 17:05.248
♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪

17:05.281 --> 17:07.450
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪

17:07.483 --> 17:09.953
Best rock and roll song
ever written.

17:09.954 --> 17:11.087
(both) Tied with <i> Kokomo.</i>

17:11.121 --> 17:12.922
Hey!
So we have good news

17:12.923 --> 17:13.990
and we have great news.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.458
The good news is
we found the ring.

17:15.459 --> 17:17.026
The great news is
we'll never lose it again.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.194
What are you trying to say?

17:18.229 --> 17:19.529
The ring is stuck on his finger.

17:19.530 --> 17:20.891
I told him not to be cute
about it.

17:20.897 --> 17:22.832
I'm cute about everything.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.267
Okay, okay, what do we do?

17:24.300 --> 17:25.367
I could pull the ring off,

17:25.368 --> 17:26.669
but it might hurt
your little fingers.

17:26.704 --> 17:27.869
That's fine.
I just won't look

17:27.871 --> 17:30.874
so I don't know when
you're gonna do it.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.542
Jenny!
No!

17:32.576 --> 17:36.713
[bone pops] [screams]

17:41.349 --> 17:42.817
Okay, this is your last chance

17:42.818 --> 17:45.019
to carry me bodyguard-style,
so...

17:45.020 --> 17:46.854
Absolutely not.

17:46.855 --> 17:49.990
20 years later
and I've been Funged again.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.959
She Funged me!

17:51.960 --> 17:53.494
She doesn't seem that great.

17:53.495 --> 17:54.729
We just saw her making out
with a guy

17:54.730 --> 17:56.163
she barely even knows.

17:56.164 --> 17:58.032
No, it's not her fault.

17:58.066 --> 18:00.401
Did you see that guy's
tux jacket?

18:00.402 --> 18:02.870
Four buttons.

18:07.142 --> 18:09.877
We did this.
Our sex made this happen.

18:09.878 --> 18:12.646
Charles, mic's on.
We can hear all this, bud.

18:20.756 --> 18:24.258
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
Welcome.

18:24.259 --> 18:29.096
Marriage is a contract...

18:29.097 --> 18:31.866
but it's so much more than that.

18:31.867 --> 18:32.867
Marriage is love.

18:32.868 --> 18:35.569
It's commitment,

18:35.604 --> 18:38.105
<i>it's joy, it's understanding,</i>

18:38.106 --> 18:41.709
<i>it's patience, it's anger,</i>

18:41.710 --> 18:44.345
<i>it's reconciliation,
it's everything.</i>

18:44.346 --> 18:46.447
It's like oatmeal.

18:46.448 --> 18:49.817
It... sustains you.

18:49.818 --> 18:52.953
Darlene, do you take Lynn to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

18:52.954 --> 18:54.355
I do.

18:54.356 --> 18:56.891
Lynn, do you take Darlene
to be your lawfully weddeded wife?

18:56.892 --> 18:57.992
I do.

18:57.993 --> 18:59.860
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

18:59.861 --> 19:01.128
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

19:01.129 --> 19:03.097
[cheers and applause]

19:03.131 --> 19:04.398
Yeah!
Get it, Daddy!

19:04.399 --> 19:05.766
[applause continues]

19:05.767 --> 19:06.767
Yeah!

19:09.571 --> 19:11.205
I gotta hand it to you, Captain.

19:11.206 --> 19:12.707
That was some ceremony.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.041
It wasn't difficult.

19:14.042 --> 19:15.543
I simply said what I wish
had been said

19:15.544 --> 19:17.078
when Kevin and I got married.

19:17.079 --> 19:19.046
Oh, then I never would have
heard your hilarious

19:19.047 --> 19:20.581
"efficient-officiant" quip.

19:20.582 --> 19:23.084
Mmm, you're right.
I regret nothing.

19:23.085 --> 19:26.687
But all this does make me think
I might enjoy a more...

19:26.688 --> 19:29.056
festive expression of our
commitment to one another.

19:29.057 --> 19:32.093
Are you suggesting we hold
an honest to goodness wedding?

19:32.094 --> 19:34.295
Nothing too elaborate.

19:34.296 --> 19:36.797
We're not the Kardashian-Wests,
after all.

19:36.798 --> 19:38.933
They are a musician
and a celebrity personality

19:38.934 --> 19:40.234
who recently wedded.

19:40.235 --> 19:41.369
Yes, yes, I know.

19:41.370 --> 19:42.636
They were answers on <i> Jeopardy.</i>

19:42.637 --> 19:43.738
I think you mean questions.

19:43.739 --> 19:46.474
[both laugh]

19:46.475 --> 19:48.209
You guys are fun.

19:50.445 --> 19:52.980
He's not playing my playlist.

19:52.981 --> 19:55.049
Congratulatis, Charles.
Marcus!

19:55.050 --> 19:56.150
Rosa said you weren't coming.

19:56.184 --> 19:57.485
Yeah, I wasn't.

19:57.486 --> 19:58.986
Just got the call
about an hour ago.

19:58.987 --> 20:00.655
<i>Oh, but, hey.</i>

20:00.656 --> 20:02.823
I'm DVR-ing <i> Bones,</i>
so no spoilers.

20:02.824 --> 20:03.924
Don't worry.
I don't watch.

20:03.925 --> 20:05.393
Too scary.

20:05.394 --> 20:07.094
I'm gonna ask the DJ
to play <i> Kokomo,</i>

20:07.095 --> 20:08.896
and get this place turnt up.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.669
So... I didn't ask you
to the wedding

20:14.670 --> 20:15.970
because I was being a coward.

20:15.971 --> 20:17.838
I was scared things
were moving too quickly,

20:17.839 --> 20:20.641
but I don't give a crap.

20:20.642 --> 20:22.943
I love you.

20:22.944 --> 20:24.178
That's all I wanted to say.

20:24.179 --> 20:27.114
If you had plans tonight,
you can get out of here.

20:27.115 --> 20:28.449
I love you too.

20:33.689 --> 20:35.623
Doesn't have <i> Kokomo.</i>

20:35.624 --> 20:37.625
You guys are in the middle
of something.

20:37.626 --> 20:40.294
I'm gonna go to the car,
get my CDs.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.475
It's not a big deal.
She's just a girl

20:54.476 --> 20:57.678
