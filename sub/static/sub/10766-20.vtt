WEBVTT

00:05.784 --> 00:08.252
Get up. Hurry, everybody, get up!

00:08.654 --> 00:11.020
Yo, what's the matter, Uncle Phil?

00:13.592 --> 00:17.358
Calm down, Will, calm down.
It's Vivian, she's having the baby.

00:17.896 --> 00:21.957
That ain't what's scaring me.
You ain't got no drawers on!

00:26.972 --> 00:27.961
Okay.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:45.324 --> 00:47.417
Mother, are you all right?

00:47.492 --> 00:50.017
Of course you're not all right.
You're having a baby.

00:50.896 --> 00:52.796
I think I'm going to be sick.

00:53.632 --> 00:56.931
Hilary, sweetie, come here.
Having a baby is very spiritual.

00:57.002 --> 01:01.063
This is my last baby and I am never
going to experience this miracle again.

01:01.373 --> 01:03.204
Here comes another contraction.

01:09.414 --> 01:11.143
Why, that wasn't so bad.

01:12.818 --> 01:14.718
Hilary, honey, don't be so dramatic.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.553
My hand.

01:18.190 --> 01:21.125
All right, it's cool.
<i>E</i> verything's cool, Aunt Viv.

01:21.193 --> 01:23.388
<i>E</i> verything's cool. All right, check it out.

01:24.029 --> 01:27.487
Carlton, you boil some water.
Ashley, you go get some blankets.

01:28.066 --> 01:31.092
Hilary, you circle the wagons.

01:32.704 --> 01:36.697
- Will, honey, what are you talking about?
- I wish to God I knew, Aunt Viv.

01:36.942 --> 01:39.467
Mom, I think what Will is referring to is...

01:44.683 --> 01:48.084
Oh, my God, the pains are getting closer.

01:48.587 --> 01:50.953
Carlton, honey, get up off the floor.

01:51.923 --> 01:53.686
My hand!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.160
What is wrong with everybody?

01:57.529 --> 02:00.794
Philip, pull up your damn pants
and let's go!

02:02.434 --> 02:04.868
- Aunt Viv, I wanna go, too.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

02:04.936 --> 02:07.700
Y ou know, I could really use somebody
to hold my hand.

03:23.548 --> 03:26.483
- Wonder if Mom had the baby yet.
- I know.

03:26.852 --> 03:29.150
Birth is a miraculous thing, isn't it?

03:29.387 --> 03:31.981
To think I was once inside
of a woman's body.

03:34.459 --> 03:36.290
I find that hard to believe.

03:37.362 --> 03:39.159
I think we all do, Carlton.

03:43.702 --> 03:45.533
Hi, Mom. Mom!

03:45.704 --> 03:47.296
Mom, you're still pregnant.

03:48.406 --> 03:49.498
You think?

03:51.710 --> 03:54.702
- I can't do this anymore.
- Look, me neither.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.839
I mean, getting woke up
in the middle of the night...

03:56.915 --> 03:59.247
by a naked man running around the house.

04:00.652 --> 04:03.280
I'm sorry, I thought you were all asleep.

04:05.824 --> 04:06.950
Not you, G.

04:07.626 --> 04:10.026
Oh, never mind.

04:11.630 --> 04:15.589
Look, now, everybody calm down.
False alarms happen all the time.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.231
But Uncle Phil was naked, Aunt Viv.

04:19.504 --> 04:20.903
Shut up, Will.

04:21.807 --> 04:25.004
Vivian, I wanna have this baby already.

04:25.076 --> 04:28.170
You think I don't? I feel like I ate a Buick.

04:29.347 --> 04:31.872
Look like a Winnebago from here.

04:32.584 --> 04:34.950
Baby, is there anything more
I can do for you?

04:35.020 --> 04:36.647
Will you look at her, Uncle Phil?

04:36.721 --> 04:39.019
Haven't you done enough?
Leave her alone.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.392
I'm fine, Philip. Thank you.

04:42.894 --> 04:45.727
Good, I gotta lay down.

04:47.365 --> 04:48.923
Can I get you some tea, madam?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.992
That would be lovely, Geoffrey.
Bring it to the laundry room.

04:52.070 --> 04:53.970
I'll be sitting on the dryer.

04:56.641 --> 04:57.869
Poor Mom.

04:59.244 --> 05:03.078
Poor Mom? Poor me.
I saw Uncle Phil naked.

05:04.049 --> 05:05.516
And he was running.

05:10.922 --> 05:12.856
What can I get for you, madam?

05:13.124 --> 05:15.592
Geoffrey, I've got a proposition for you.

05:15.660 --> 05:20.222
Perhaps if we were both younger,
and I didn't work for you.

05:21.266 --> 05:23.632
Not that kind of proposition, Geoffrey.

05:24.369 --> 05:27.770
I will give you $50
to drive me over a set of railroad tracks.

05:29.908 --> 05:33.105
Well, Doctor,
the pains are coming closer together.

05:33.745 --> 05:35.576
Well, they start in the abdomen...

05:35.647 --> 05:38.445
and they kind of radiate up and down
in all directions.

05:38.516 --> 05:40.984
Philip, what are you talking about?
I'm not having any pains.

05:41.052 --> 05:42.314
Well, I am.

05:43.355 --> 05:46.654
Well, yes, Thursday afternoon will be fine.
Yes, thank you.

05:49.828 --> 05:52.058
Yes, your Majesty?

05:53.265 --> 05:57.497
Geoffrey, from an objective point of view,
who is having this baby? Him or me?

06:03.742 --> 06:06.711
It's rather difficult to tell just by looking.

06:11.716 --> 06:15.083
She's in here. Look, whatever
you do, don't mention her chins.

06:15.153 --> 06:17.121
Or her ankles. Or her feet.

06:17.822 --> 06:21.656
And whatever you do,
never ever feed her after midnight.

06:25.096 --> 06:27.587
Poor Diva.

06:30.802 --> 06:33.032
Look at you.

06:33.104 --> 06:35.766
- I'm sick of this.
- Look at you.

06:38.410 --> 06:40.139
No more, y'all, come on. No more.

06:41.546 --> 06:44.344
- Will, why are you crying?
- I don't know, man.

06:45.917 --> 06:47.282
Wait a minute, where's Helen?

06:47.352 --> 06:50.219
She couldn't come.
She had to go to court with Lester.

06:50.288 --> 06:52.552
Well, I thought the divorce was final
months ago.

06:52.624 --> 06:55.491
That's right
and everything was going so well...

06:55.560 --> 06:57.926
until she saw Lester
with another woman...

06:57.996 --> 07:00.988
and that's when she snatched off the wig.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.595
- She snatched off the woman's wig?
- No, Lester's.

07:12.944 --> 07:16.141
What a novel idea, that little bell.

07:17.882 --> 07:20.476
Geoffrey, would you get us all
something to eat, please?

07:20.552 --> 07:25.046
Golly, yes.
It's great to be working in the big house.

07:29.694 --> 07:32.185
You've all met our butler, Chicken George?

07:34.799 --> 07:38.565
Don't you worry, Vivian,
I am going to take good care of you.

07:39.004 --> 07:40.835
Me, too.

07:41.339 --> 07:43.773
I'm so happy you guys are here.

07:43.842 --> 07:46.640
I was beginning to feel
like nobody understood me.

07:46.711 --> 07:49.908
We're family. We love you.

07:52.684 --> 07:54.811
Stop with the damn bell!

07:55.887 --> 07:58.651
That's it,
I'm never going back up there again.

07:58.790 --> 08:01.623
I'm sorry I ever went up there
in the first place.

08:01.926 --> 08:03.518
I took her some honey for her tea.

08:03.595 --> 08:06.564
She tells me
she does not want honey from California.

08:06.698 --> 08:09.428
She wants honey from New Mexico.

08:10.935 --> 08:15.372
Please. Diva needs to get her
butt out of Bel-Air a little more often.

08:16.541 --> 08:20.477
If it get any bigger, it'll be in and out
of Bel-Air at the same time.

08:22.847 --> 08:24.940
Oh, my goodness.

08:25.016 --> 08:28.110
All right, come on, y'all.
This ain't easy on Aunt Viv.

08:28.186 --> 08:30.177
I mean, the baby is a week late.

08:34.993 --> 08:37.086
All right, that bell is mine. Who's with me?

08:38.596 --> 08:42.327
All right, Hilary, you act like you're gonna
hug her and then pin her arms down.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.231
- I know the chokehold.
- Better.

08:44.803 --> 08:47.738
Hold it, now. Now, that's enough.

08:48.239 --> 08:50.935
Now, you know this is harder on her
than it is on us.

08:51.009 --> 08:53.569
We're her family,
we have to be here for her.

08:54.512 --> 08:58.414
You guys,
why isn't anybody answering my bell?

09:02.687 --> 09:06.453
Could somebody please come upstairs
and keep me company?

09:09.761 --> 09:11.729
You hate me, don't you?

09:16.634 --> 09:19.626
Okay, I know this has been hard to take...

09:19.704 --> 09:22.605
and this baby does not look like
he's coming any time too soon...

09:22.674 --> 09:25.973
so why don't we just take a breather
from one another?

09:26.611 --> 09:28.772
You know, just for a little while.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.075
Hello?

09:42.594 --> 09:44.721
Geoffrey, have you seen my bell?

09:46.598 --> 09:47.792
What bell?

09:55.106 --> 09:58.269
I don't blame you, Geoffrey,
I've been pretty unbearable.

09:58.443 --> 10:01.105
Do you think my family
is ever gonna come back?

10:01.179 --> 10:02.544
I doubt it.

10:03.248 --> 10:05.876
Why don't you sit down
and let me make you some tea?

10:05.950 --> 10:08.646
Geoffrey, you know,
you always know what to do.

10:11.122 --> 10:15.582
Now, you relax. If anything happens,
Mr. Banks has Master William's beeper.

10:15.660 --> 10:19.255
And I'm sure your sisters will be back
from the salon any minute.

10:30.141 --> 10:32.666
Hilary, this is great. I really needed this.

10:32.744 --> 10:35.838
I know, and some electrolysis
wouldn't hurt you, either.

10:38.082 --> 10:40.380
This could get ugly. We're family.

10:44.522 --> 10:46.183
Aren't you guys finished yet?

10:46.257 --> 10:49.715
Carlton, Aunt Vy is getting a makeover.
It could take hours.

10:51.329 --> 10:53.889
Am I wearing a "kick me" sign?

10:54.999 --> 10:58.162
I don't see why women spend
so much time in these places.

11:01.506 --> 11:02.734
Wow.

11:03.474 --> 11:05.999
Forget college, I'm going to beauty school.

11:07.078 --> 11:10.377
Look, if I'm not back in 20 minutes,
be really happy for me.

11:18.523 --> 11:20.991
- Way to go, speedy.
- Shut up.

11:21.292 --> 11:24.489
You know, Will, I could have
driven myself here for my examination.

11:24.562 --> 11:26.427
I don't think so, Uncle Phil.

11:26.497 --> 11:30.490
I think you're taking this sympathy pains
thing just a wee bit too far.

11:30.568 --> 11:32.297
Don't be ridiculous, Will.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.368
Oh, my God. I think my water broke.

11:41.512 --> 11:44.504
Oh, my God, it's Vivian.
She's having the baby.

11:44.582 --> 11:46.948
- We gotta get to the hospital!
- Uncle Phil...

11:47.385 --> 11:48.579
we in the hospital.

11:50.321 --> 11:53.085
Good, 'cause I'm having a heart attack.

11:53.958 --> 11:57.086
Uncle Phil, I think you better
let me take care of this.

11:57.862 --> 12:00.729
False alarm, Uncle Phil.
It's for me, it's Carla.

12:02.367 --> 12:05.336
402436, that's no phone number.

12:05.403 --> 12:09.806
No, Uncle Phil, that's 40, 24, 36.

12:19.951 --> 12:21.077
Shut up.

12:32.063 --> 12:35.055
<i>E</i> xcuse me, sir, would you mind
putting out that cigarette?

12:35.133 --> 12:36.930
It's a free country.

12:38.002 --> 12:39.128
That's right, it certainly is...

12:39.203 --> 12:41.899
but it's against the law
to smoke cigarettes in elevators.

12:51.816 --> 12:54.216
That's right, boy, this is a New Jack City.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.552
You the man. You the man.

13:01.926 --> 13:04.554
You the big man that broke the elevator.

13:09.734 --> 13:12.726
Geoffrey,
I think we better beep Mr. Banks.

13:14.138 --> 13:15.162
Oh, dear.

13:15.773 --> 13:18.674
Okay. Keep calm.

13:18.876 --> 13:22.869
I think we'd better beep Mr. Banks.

13:23.481 --> 13:27.076
- Geoffrey, I just said that.
- Good, that's good.

13:27.151 --> 13:30.587
Now, we're on the same train of thought.

13:37.295 --> 13:39.490
How do you work this bloody thing?

13:40.631 --> 13:42.622
Thank God you're here.

13:45.903 --> 13:47.097
Oh, God!

13:53.077 --> 13:55.102
Uncle Phil, is that you?

13:55.279 --> 13:58.771
No, but you have really soft hands.

14:02.754 --> 14:06.212
Mommy! Ma!

14:07.158 --> 14:09.126
Relax, Will.

14:09.193 --> 14:11.559
I'm sure they'll have us out of here
in no time.

14:17.702 --> 14:19.329
Uncle Phil, that's Aunt Viv.

14:19.404 --> 14:23.363
Oh, my God, somebody get us out of here!
I'm having a baby!

14:30.681 --> 14:31.875
Something must be wrong.

14:31.949 --> 14:34.679
I've beeped him twice
and he still hasn't answered.

14:36.187 --> 14:38.382
My hand!

14:39.457 --> 14:41.391
I'd better try the beauty salon.

14:49.066 --> 14:51.330
So, while she's been stepping out on him...

14:51.402 --> 14:54.371
he's been having an affair with her sister.

14:54.439 --> 14:56.703
But she works here so keep it quiet.

14:58.943 --> 15:01.070
- Okay.
- What?

15:06.150 --> 15:07.981
Black Beauty, how can I help you?

15:08.052 --> 15:10.486
Y eah, right, it's always an emergency.

15:10.588 --> 15:13.648
I'll ask. Vy Smith, phone call.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.487
Sorry, nobody's answering.

15:17.929 --> 15:20.864
Don't you just love these quiet girl talks?

15:21.632 --> 15:22.860
What?

15:23.634 --> 15:25.067
I know.

15:27.505 --> 15:28.597
Great.

15:28.673 --> 15:32.302
Geoffrey, it looks like you're gonna
have to drive me to the hospital.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.001
Will I steer with my left foot?

15:36.614 --> 15:38.013
I hate men.

15:38.983 --> 15:40.416
Hi, Mommy.

15:40.585 --> 15:43.554
Oh, my God, here comes another one.
Ashley, give me your hand!

15:43.621 --> 15:45.282
- No way.
- Ashley!

15:45.356 --> 15:47.449
- Geoffrey!
- Y ou keep away from me.

15:53.831 --> 15:56.698
This baby's coming.
I gotta get to the hospital.

15:56.767 --> 15:59.031
Don't worry, Mom, I'll get you there.

16:00.037 --> 16:01.732
Ashley, you can't drive.

16:01.806 --> 16:04.832
Grow up. I've been taking the car
since I was 12. Come on.

16:20.358 --> 16:23.122
How much longer
before somebody gets us out of here?

16:23.194 --> 16:24.957
My wife's having a baby.

16:25.029 --> 16:27.896
- She ain't in there with you, is she?
- No.

16:28.032 --> 16:30.592
- Good, 'cause I'm going on a break.
- What?

16:33.905 --> 16:36.874
Just kidding, a little elevator humor there.

16:36.941 --> 16:37.965
Oh, man.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.533
All right, I'll get you out of there
as soon as I can.

16:41.746 --> 16:44.715
Hi, honey, I'm gonna be late for lunch.

16:45.349 --> 16:46.976
Great, you have a phone.

16:47.852 --> 16:50.082
That's right, and you don't.

16:51.856 --> 16:54.324
Will, we gotta get that phone.

16:55.426 --> 16:57.291
Look, Uncle Phil, just ask him nice.

16:57.361 --> 17:00.819
No, after what I did to him,
he's never going to let me use it.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.199
Well, you know, I'm coming
straight out the hood, right?

17:06.871 --> 17:08.771
All right, where I come from...

17:08.839 --> 17:11.535
when we want something,
we step up on it and take it.

17:12.276 --> 17:13.402
Observe.

17:14.111 --> 17:16.602
Please, can I use your phone?

17:18.015 --> 17:19.778
Look, man,
if you don't let me use your phone...

17:19.849 --> 17:22.910
I'm gonna start singing
Paula Abdul's greatest hits.

17:23.588 --> 17:26.113
I guess you want
to use this phone real bad, huh?

17:26.824 --> 17:28.290
Yes, sir, I do.

17:28.559 --> 17:30.959
About as bad as I wanted that cigarette?

17:32.530 --> 17:34.157
Stop, ghetto time.

17:34.231 --> 17:37.530
No, Will. Calm down. No.

17:37.602 --> 17:40.730
Calm down, now.
Now, I trained as a lawyer for many years.

17:40.805 --> 17:44.332
I was trained
in the art of negotiation, okay?

17:46.043 --> 17:47.203
Observe.

17:51.382 --> 17:54.442
Sir, give me that damn phone...

17:54.518 --> 17:57.282
or I'm gonna rip your liver out
and eat it raw.

17:57.355 --> 17:59.983
That's right, boy,
and he about due for a snack.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.818
Yes, sir.

18:04.362 --> 18:05.954
Yes, Mr. Banks.

18:06.030 --> 18:09.056
Mrs. Banks should be arriving
at the hospital any minute.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.431
- <i>What? Who drove her?</i>
- Who drove?

18:11.636 --> 18:14.104
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You are trapped in an elevator, right?

18:14.171 --> 18:16.196
<i>Yes, yes I'm trapped in an elevator.</i>
<i>Now who drove her?</i>

18:16.273 --> 18:17.604
Miss Ashley drove.

18:17.875 --> 18:21.140
<i>What? How could you let that happen?</i>
<i>Are you insane?</i>

18:21.212 --> 18:24.306
No, sir, I don't know how
I could have let that happen.

18:24.849 --> 18:27.477
<i>Call Mrs. Banks' sisters and</i>
<i>tell them to meet her at the hospital.</i>

18:27.551 --> 18:29.576
Y es, sir, I'll call the salon right away.

18:29.654 --> 18:33.454
<i>I am furious at you, Geoffrey!</i>
<i>This is completely irresponsible of you.</i>

18:33.524 --> 18:37.790
Yes, sir, I'm a very, very bad butler.

18:37.862 --> 18:41.320
In fact, I'm going to punish myself.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.727
No phone privileges for a week.

18:54.545 --> 18:56.376
Don't worry, Geoffrey, we're on our way.

18:56.447 --> 18:58.779
Vivian's having the baby.
We've got to get out of here.

18:58.849 --> 19:01.147
- Finally. I'll go get Carlton.
- Come on, Hilary.

19:01.218 --> 19:05.279
I can't go into a hospital looking like this.
The place is full of doctors.

19:06.190 --> 19:08.249
Hilary, please don't tell me
you're that superficial.

19:08.325 --> 19:12.489
Well, it may be superficial to you,
but I'm young, I can still get a husband.

19:13.998 --> 19:16.364
Not without any teeth, you won't.

19:20.204 --> 19:21.933
That girl wanted me, Aunt Janice.

19:22.006 --> 19:24.736
Carlton, when a woman says,
"Drop dead, troll..."

19:24.809 --> 19:27.676
it usually means she's not interested.
Now, come on.

19:28.913 --> 19:30.244
I'll call you.

19:37.488 --> 19:38.716
I'm sorry, young lady...

19:38.789 --> 19:42.384
but you are going to have to fill out
these insurance forms like everyone else.

19:42.460 --> 19:45.293
I'm a kid.
I don't know jack about insurance.

19:46.130 --> 19:49.099
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.

19:49.300 --> 19:53.031
Oh, my God, here comes a big one.
Nurse, could you hold my hand, please?

19:58.275 --> 20:00.903
Get this woman to a birthing room.

20:03.547 --> 20:05.708
<i>Dr. Fagin, telephone, please.</i>

20:09.253 --> 20:10.948
What happened to Hilary?

20:11.055 --> 20:13.717
Hilary Violet Banks, get your butt in here.

20:17.561 --> 20:19.028
My hand.

20:20.598 --> 20:22.623
I'm pretty sure Mom has been here.

20:24.101 --> 20:25.864
Look, this is an emergency.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.299
Do you have any mascara?

20:30.241 --> 20:32.732
Where is the woman that did this to you?

20:33.544 --> 20:34.602
Down the hall.

20:34.678 --> 20:36.669
- Let's go.
- Come on. She's down here.

20:41.352 --> 20:43.479
Vivian, we got here as soon as we could.

20:43.554 --> 20:44.851
You doing okay, baby?

20:44.922 --> 20:46.583
She's fine. I took care of things.

20:46.657 --> 20:48.921
All right, look, I appreciate
that you're a close family...

20:48.993 --> 20:50.358
but you all can't be in here.

20:50.427 --> 20:52.258
- I'll go.
- Me, too.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.397
This is what I usually look like.

21:01.038 --> 21:03.802
Philip!

21:10.414 --> 21:11.642
Vivian.

21:14.385 --> 21:16.250
Wilma!

21:18.756 --> 21:20.053
Dad, over here.

21:21.158 --> 21:22.955
Where? Where is she?

21:23.027 --> 21:25.018
- That way.
- Vivian!

21:30.401 --> 21:32.130
Say hello to your new son.

21:41.846 --> 21:44.314
We should get a picture of this.
Doc, would you do the honors?

21:44.381 --> 21:45.370
Sure.

21:46.650 --> 21:49.016
Look, he look like a little black yoda.

21:51.488 --> 21:55.982
- He's adorable.
- Hello, little Nicholas Andrew Banks.

21:59.496 --> 22:01.862
Honey, I thought we agreed
to call him Philip.

22:01.932 --> 22:03.729
That's a stupid name.

22:05.502 --> 22:08.403
Why don't we name him after Daddy? <i>E</i> li.

22:08.472 --> 22:10.440
- Great.
- No, over my dead body.

22:11.809 --> 22:14.300
- Let's name him Rufus.
- How about Brock?

22:15.012 --> 22:16.104
Shazam!

22:19.250 --> 22:20.512
Smile.

22:24.221 --> 22:25.950
<i>Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.</i>

22:48.946 --> 22:50.607
<i>Wilma!</i>
