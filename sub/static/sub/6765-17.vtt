WEBVTT

00:10.069 --> 00:12.196
Hey, Senor McKay.
Que pasa, bud?

00:12.237 --> 00:13.363
Hey, brother, what's up?

00:13.405 --> 00:15.566
l just got done
stuffing my face.

00:15.607 --> 00:17.871
Cool, l just got done
taking my last final.

00:17.910 --> 00:19.571
l'm a free man till
next semester starts.

00:19.611 --> 00:21.010
Yeah, what are you going
to do with all that freedom?

00:21.080 --> 00:22.411
Probably nothing.

00:22.448 --> 00:23.710
That's a novel concept.

00:23.749 --> 00:25.239
Well, l had two trips planned,

00:25.284 --> 00:27.479
but then with the Peach Pit
After Dark opening this week,

00:27.519 --> 00:28.543
Donna canceled our annual

00:28.587 --> 00:29.554
ski trip to Arrowhead,

00:29.588 --> 00:30.987
and then Kelly and l were going

00:31.023 --> 00:32.991
to Palm Springs,
but with the burn,

00:33.025 --> 00:35.220
she doesn't want to be laying
by the pool, getting a tan.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.420
Yeah, yeah,
so what do you think,

00:36.462 --> 00:38.157
you want to take
a little road trip with me?

00:38.197 --> 00:39.255
What'd you have in mind?

00:39.298 --> 00:40.663
l was thinking
maybe Lake Whitney,

00:40.699 --> 00:41.825
couple of days, camping out.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.334
Cool. When do we leave?

00:43.368 --> 00:44.335
ln about an hour.

00:44.369 --> 00:45.461
No, seriously,
when do we leave?

00:45.504 --> 00:47.199
ln about an hour.
l only got three days

00:47.239 --> 00:48.866
and my probation kicks in,
l lose my driver's license.

00:48.907 --> 00:50.499
So, that's cool. l'll drive.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.238
No, dude, when l said road trip,
l was thinking of a...

00:53.278 --> 00:55.109
road trip.

00:56.582 --> 00:58.573
You want to go to Lake Whitney
on motorcycles?!

00:58.617 --> 01:01.177
The thought had crossed my mind.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.118 --> 02:08.586
Well, from what l hear,
The Peach Pit After Dark

02:08.620 --> 02:10.383
is basically a disaster
waiting to happen.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.289
And that they think they're
actually going to open

02:13.325 --> 02:14.815
for business in two days
is a total joke.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.122
Just thinking about it
pisses me off.

02:16.161 --> 02:19.460
Not that l care anymore,
you understand.

02:19.498 --> 02:20.863
l just feel badly for Nat.

02:20.899 --> 02:22.890
He's the one whose reputation
is on the line here.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.665
l mean, David and Clare,
they're my friends,

02:25.704 --> 02:27.467
but they are completely
ill-equipped

02:27.506 --> 02:28.530
to run a night club,
and deal with

02:28.574 --> 02:30.633
a venal egomaniac
like my father.

02:30.676 --> 02:34.009
The truth is, if Rush wasn't
such a miserable human being

02:34.046 --> 02:36.207
l'd probably be feeling sorry
for him right about now.

02:36.248 --> 02:37.772
l mean, he must've sunk
at least two bills

02:37.816 --> 02:38.942
into this place so far,

02:38.984 --> 02:41.214
but that's his problem,
not mine.

02:41.253 --> 02:42.311
l mean, that's what he gets

02:42.354 --> 02:44.151
for cutting me out
of the deal, right?

02:44.189 --> 02:46.157
Well, yeah, you're much
better off not being involved.

02:46.191 --> 02:47.988
l'm telling you, the day
the judge prohibited me

02:48.026 --> 02:49.755
from participating
in any parties

02:49.795 --> 02:51.387
was the first day of
the rest of my life.

02:51.430 --> 02:52.692
Nat.

02:52.731 --> 02:53.857
Yeah?

02:53.899 --> 02:55.457
How's everything going
in the war room?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.730
Fantastic. lt's really
coming together.

02:59.104 --> 03:00.731
Poor guy.

03:00.772 --> 03:04.333
Oh, your father
is such a hoot.

03:04.376 --> 03:05.536
Yeah, a royal pain
in the hoot.

03:05.577 --> 03:06.805
No, l'm serious.

03:06.845 --> 03:09.211
Look, l know you guys have
a weird relationship,

03:09.248 --> 03:10.340
but he's fun,

03:10.382 --> 03:12.179
and he's so
professional, too.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.447
Hey, maybe everything's
going to work out after all.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.756
Shut up, Muntz.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.654
l'm telling you, it's true,

03:23.695 --> 03:25.356
it's me and Shecky Greene
and 50 girls

03:25.397 --> 03:26.625
from the Follies Bergere
running around

03:26.665 --> 03:27.996
with their bazoomies
hanging out,

03:28.100 --> 03:31.365
and l look over in the corner
and standing in the wings

03:31.403 --> 03:32.529
is Mother Teresa

03:32.571 --> 03:33.595
-and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
-Yeah, right.

03:33.639 --> 03:34.936
-Uh-uh.
-l swear to God.

03:34.973 --> 03:38.670
-You don't believe me.
-No, l don't believe...

03:43.382 --> 03:46.442
You remember when l wanted to
lay out traps for the field mice

03:46.485 --> 03:49.648
and you wouldn't let me and you
said what harm do they do?

03:49.688 --> 03:52.885
Luckily Brenda's sleeping bag
was spared.

03:52.924 --> 03:54.687
You don't think
she'll mind, do you?

03:54.726 --> 03:56.023
Well, l don't imagine so.

03:56.094 --> 03:58.460
l don't think she'll be
using it this weekend.

03:58.497 --> 04:00.488
But, honey, l thought you were
going to stay in motels.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.556
That's only tonight.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.760
After that it's man
against nature.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.496
Well, suppose it rains?

04:04.536 --> 04:06.128
Honey, l really
think that taking

04:06.171 --> 04:07.968
the station wagon
is a much better idea.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.371
Mom, l know l haven't ridden
a bike in a while,

04:10.409 --> 04:11.899
but we're gonna be fine.

04:11.943 --> 04:14.639
Well, Dylan doesn't exactly
have a great driving record.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.942
Dad, he's past his toxic stage.

04:15.981 --> 04:17.471
l hope so.

04:17.516 --> 04:18.949
l guess you can use
this as a chance

04:18.983 --> 04:20.281
to rekindle your friendship.

04:20.319 --> 04:21.809
That's the whole point.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.787
lt's an American tradition.
Two old buds hitting the road.

04:23.822 --> 04:25.255
lt's Easy Rider.

04:25.290 --> 04:29.226
Brandon, that film ended with
both riders being blown to bits.

04:29.261 --> 04:32.594
Guess that means it didn't
have a happy ending, huh?

04:37.703 --> 04:39.671
Hey, babe, you're just in time
to convince my parents

04:39.705 --> 04:41.639
the only bad thing that's
gonna happen on this trip

04:41.673 --> 04:43.766
is that you're going
to miss me while l'm gone.

04:43.809 --> 04:44.776
Oh, don't count on it.

04:44.810 --> 04:47.506
Look what l got invited to.

04:47.546 --> 04:49.605
200 bucks for a
one-day workshop?

04:49.648 --> 04:51.343
No, no, they gave it
to me for free

04:51.383 --> 04:52.714
for getting an ''A''
in Abnormal Psych.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.343
Well, congratulations.

04:54.386 --> 04:55.751
Thank you.

04:55.787 --> 04:56.913
Well, obviously Patrick Finley
doesn't work cheap.

04:56.955 --> 04:58.252
Who's Patrick Finley?

04:58.290 --> 05:01.123
He's one of the most popular
professors on campus.

05:01.159 --> 05:03.821
He's practically reinventing
the field of modern psychology.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.887
He has this very
unorthodox theory.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.262
lt's called the
''New Evolution''.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.460
l thought they were still
arguing about the old evolution.

05:09.501 --> 05:11.799
Some people are, but
some of us have to pack.

05:11.837 --> 05:12.963
Want some help?

05:13.038 --> 05:14.630
-l'd love some.
-Cool.

05:19.244 --> 05:20.609
Come over here.

05:23.849 --> 05:26.317
You and Dylan better not
compare notes about me.

05:26.351 --> 05:27.375
No.

05:27.419 --> 05:28.750
'Cause if you do,

05:28.787 --> 05:30.755
Kelly and l are gonna have
to spend the weekend

05:30.789 --> 05:32.279
gossiping about you and Dylan.

05:32.324 --> 05:33.814
Well, you'll have
to gossip without me,

05:33.859 --> 05:35.952
because l've been invited
to Professor Finley's workshop.

05:35.994 --> 05:36.926
Really? So was l.

05:36.962 --> 05:37.929
You were?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.794
You got an ''A''
in Abnormal Psych?

05:39.831 --> 05:41.162
Well, with the family
that l have,

05:41.199 --> 05:42.461
l should have gotten an A-plus.

05:43.235 --> 05:44.202
That's Dylan.

05:44.236 --> 05:45.464
Listen, l'll get it.

05:45.504 --> 05:46.994
You guys finish packing.

05:47.105 --> 05:49.266
You know, l wasn't going
to go to the workshop,

05:49.307 --> 05:52.333
but now that you are,
it might be kind of fun.

05:55.881 --> 05:57.178
lt was going to be.

05:57.215 --> 05:59.911
Kelly, you said you'd
start being nicer to her.

05:59.951 --> 06:03.182
Yeah, l know, l know,
but a whole day of Valerie?

06:04.089 --> 06:05.613
l'll try.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.181
Okay.

06:10.529 --> 06:12.929
But isn't it kind of cold up in
the mountains this time of year?

06:12.964 --> 06:15.228
Yeah, it'll be a little brisk.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.963
Brandon will build one
of his award-winning campfires.

06:18.069 --> 06:20.299
Well, lucky for you,
Brandon was a Boy Scout.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.772
Once a Webelo, always a Webelo.

06:22.808 --> 06:24.298
-Saddle up, man.
-Let's get out of here.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.469
All right. Hey, George
picked out a 916 for you.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.978
Arguably, the best
motorcycle in the world.

06:28.013 --> 06:28.980
Cool.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.413
Why am l so nervous?

06:30.449 --> 06:31.916
Because you're a mom.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.474
Listen, Cindy, don't
worry about it.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.712
l'll take care of
your boy, all right?

06:34.753 --> 06:35.720
Let's hit it.

06:35.754 --> 06:36.846
Bye, guys.

06:36.888 --> 06:38.753
Bye, hon.

06:42.327 --> 06:43.794
Let's go.

07:19.698 --> 07:22.292
You know, a week ago,
l would have said

07:22.334 --> 07:24.325
there was no possible way
we would've been ready

07:24.369 --> 07:25.859
-to open by tomorrow night.
-Mm-hmm.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.838
Well, if we've proven anything,
it's that most problems

07:27.873 --> 07:29.966
can be solved with a...
a little teamwork

07:30.008 --> 07:31.873
and a lot of cash.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.844
l have two burgers left.

07:33.879 --> 07:35.403
Who's missing?

07:35.447 --> 07:36.812
Oh. Ray and Donna said they'll
be back in a couple minutes.

07:36.848 --> 07:38.315
Oh, cool.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.284
Oh, tell me about this kid Ray.

07:40.318 --> 07:41.842
Where did he play before?

07:44.155 --> 07:46.988
Ray, what is the worst thing
that can happen to you?

07:47.058 --> 07:48.855
The worst thing that can happen?

07:48.894 --> 07:50.452
l get up onstage to sing,

07:50.495 --> 07:53.487
l open my mouth,
and nothing comes out.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.295
Then l puke, then l die.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.300
Ray!

07:56.334 --> 07:57.926
Look, l know you
went out on a limb

07:57.969 --> 08:00.904
to get me this gig, but l'm
telling you, it's just too soon.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.406
You're always going
to feel that way

08:02.440 --> 08:03.668
until you make
some sort of effort

08:03.708 --> 08:04.936
to deal with your stage fright.

08:05.043 --> 08:07.170
Now, just stand up there onstage

08:07.212 --> 08:09.476
and, and, and try to find
something to focus on.

08:09.514 --> 08:11.311
Right, like looking at a light

08:11.349 --> 08:13.442
is going to make me feel
better about tomorrow.

08:13.485 --> 08:16.818
Okay, then you tell me.
What would make you feel better?

08:16.855 --> 08:19.323
How about getting Stow
to play on the beat?

08:19.357 --> 08:21.757
Or how about a new bridge
for ''l Know the Game?''

08:21.793 --> 08:24.125
'Cause the way the song goes
now, it just doesn't work.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.159
Your songs are fine.

08:28.199 --> 08:30.292
Your bass player is fine.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.304
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.342
What's up, Easy Rider?

08:43.381 --> 08:44.780
Was l going too fast for you?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.306
What would give
you that idea?

08:46.351 --> 08:47.818
l don't know, the fact
l haven't seen you

08:47.852 --> 08:48.819
in about 20 minutes.

08:48.853 --> 08:50.081
Uh-huh.

08:50.121 --> 08:52.248
The place we're staying
is right up the road.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.498
So, what are you
going to have, bro?

09:03.535 --> 09:05.935
You know, l think
Kerouac said it best.

09:05.971 --> 09:07.939
Going on the road's all
about finding good pie.

09:07.973 --> 09:09.304
l don't think
Kerouac was eating

09:09.341 --> 09:11.707
from the four
basic food groups.

09:11.743 --> 09:13.370
Okay, darlings,

09:13.411 --> 09:14.708
what can l get you?

09:14.746 --> 09:18.944
Uh... uh, could l have the,
uh, mushroom barley soup

09:18.984 --> 09:21.452
and the garlic
bread, please?

09:21.486 --> 09:22.919
How's the apple pie?

09:22.954 --> 09:24.080
ls it homemade?

09:24.122 --> 09:26.488
l baked it myself
in my own little oven.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.151
l'd like to see that oven.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.387
You and me both.

09:29.427 --> 09:30.621
Could we see your oven?

09:30.662 --> 09:31.856
Take a number.

09:31.896 --> 09:35.764
Okay.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.496
l'll have the pie
and a cup of coffee.

09:42.641 --> 09:43.801
Mercy.

09:43.842 --> 09:45.434
You're having pie
for dinner?

09:45.477 --> 09:47.206
Dude, l'm having whatever
she's bringing me, okay?

09:47.245 --> 09:48.735
Health is overrated.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.645
On this trip,
l'm feeding my soul.

09:50.682 --> 09:52.843
Man, the last time l heard
somebody talk about

09:52.884 --> 09:54.977
''feeding their soul'',
l was in Washington

09:55.086 --> 09:56.644
on task force business.

09:56.688 --> 09:58.178
Oh, please.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.986
No, this is good.

10:00.091 --> 10:01.854
l walk into this reception,

10:01.893 --> 10:03.292
there's Lucinda
Nicholson, right?

10:03.328 --> 10:04.590
Look, man, the last person

10:04.629 --> 10:06.153
l want to hear about
is Lucinda Nicholson.

10:06.197 --> 10:07.630
No, this is a funny
story, l'm telling you

10:07.666 --> 10:08.997
lt's not a funny story.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.399
Every time l hear her name,
l get reminded how she tried

10:11.436 --> 10:13.768
to hustle me into financing
that stupid documentary

10:13.805 --> 10:16.797
while you were off
for the weekend hustling Kelly.

10:17.942 --> 10:19.705
My father told me
we'd be fighting

10:19.744 --> 10:21.336
before we got to
the campground.

10:21.379 --> 10:23.006
Well, l just didn't want us

10:23.048 --> 10:25.175
to not have anything
to talk about, you know.

10:25.216 --> 10:27.184
Well, what would you like
to talk about, Jack Kerouac?

10:27.218 --> 10:29.186
Hey, yeah, let's talk
about Jack Kerouac.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.517
Okay, let's talk
about Jack Kerouac.

10:30.555 --> 10:31.954
l read On the Road, l hated it.

10:31.990 --> 10:33.617
What do you mean,
you hated it?

10:33.658 --> 10:36.252
l hated it. l read The Dharma
Bums, l hated that, too.

10:36.294 --> 10:37.352
How're my boys doing?

10:42.534 --> 10:44.502
Yeah, Mom,
l can appreciate that,

10:44.536 --> 10:46.231
but l'm gonna go to bed now.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.296
l love you, too. Good-bye.

10:52.644 --> 10:54.009
What?!

10:54.045 --> 10:56.980
Hi, Brandon.
l was hoping you'd call.

10:57.015 --> 10:58.312
-How are you doing?
-Worn out.

10:58.349 --> 11:00.317
l made the mistake
of telling my mom

11:00.351 --> 11:02.444
l'm going to that Finley
workshop tomorrow,

11:02.487 --> 11:05.285
and she went on and on about
how when she was pregnant,

11:05.323 --> 11:07.689
she went to her first
consciousness-raising seminar.

11:07.726 --> 11:09.284
l'm sorry l missed that.

11:09.327 --> 11:10.294
Did you take notes?

11:10.328 --> 11:11.590
Fortunately, no.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.596
Where are you?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.427
A little town called Lone Pine.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.956
Are you sure
you two aren't shacking up

11:16.000 --> 11:17.262
with some biker babes?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.361
Nope. lt's just me,
Dylan and the open wound.

11:19.404 --> 11:20.564
Open road, honey.

11:20.605 --> 11:22.197
Open wound feels more like it.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.299
So, you're not having fun?

11:24.342 --> 11:25.707
Not yet.

11:25.744 --> 11:28.269
Listen, l'll call
you back tomorrow.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.009
Yeah, l love you, too.
Good night.

11:31.082 --> 11:32.344
You didn't have to wait

11:32.383 --> 11:34.408
till l got in the shower
to call her, you know?

11:34.452 --> 11:35.817
Well, thanks
for telling me that.

11:35.854 --> 11:38.345
l could call her back if you
want to say good night, too.

11:38.389 --> 11:39.378
You got a problem?

11:39.424 --> 11:41.255
No, l don't have a problem,

11:41.292 --> 11:44.261
but any question l had about
our friendship was answered

11:44.295 --> 11:47.162
by the way you looked after
seeing Kelly at my house.

11:47.198 --> 11:48.495
Look, don't talk to me
about Kelly, all right?

11:48.533 --> 11:49.898
l don't want to hear
about Kelly anymore.

11:49.934 --> 11:51.401
Why don't we just get
all this stuff together

11:51.436 --> 11:52.698
and get back on the road
tomorrow?

11:52.737 --> 11:54.227
Sure, we'll get back
on the road,

11:54.272 --> 11:56.467
and l'll be watching
your license plate all day.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.738
ls it my fault you can't keep up
with me? l don't think so.

11:58.777 --> 12:00.244
Okay, l'll make it a no-brainer.

12:00.278 --> 12:01.870
l'll just go back to L.A.
tomorrow morning.

12:01.913 --> 12:03.380
Why don't you just
go back tonight?

12:03.414 --> 12:05.109
'Cause l already paid
for the room.

12:06.818 --> 12:07.944
Good night.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.164
Are we nuts to take a class
on semester break?

12:24.202 --> 12:27.228
lf we are, we're
not the only nuts.

12:27.272 --> 12:28.569
Great.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.005
We've become one
with the pod people.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.009
Wouldn't you rather
be shopping?

12:32.043 --> 12:33.943
Ask me in a
couple of hours.

12:33.978 --> 12:35.878
Kelly! l'm glad you made it.

12:35.914 --> 12:37.279
Oh, hi, Sara.

12:37.315 --> 12:41.342
You, uh, know Valerie Malone
from Abnormal Psych, right?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.580
l graded your exam.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.144
l'm surprised we
haven't met before.

12:44.189 --> 12:45.816
Well, l've missed
a lot of classes.

12:45.857 --> 12:47.654
Mostly due to illness.

12:47.692 --> 12:49.216
Sorry. Are you
feeling better?

12:49.260 --> 12:50.522
Uh, still a little weak,

12:50.562 --> 12:52.587
so l might have
to leave early.

12:52.630 --> 12:54.154
l think
they're about to start.

12:54.199 --> 12:57.464
Hello, everyone.
l'm Dan McGrath,

12:57.502 --> 13:00.130
and l am one of
six grad students,

13:00.171 --> 13:03.197
uh, with swanky name tags

13:03.241 --> 13:04.868
who will be assisting
Patrick Finley

13:04.909 --> 13:08.743
over what should be
a very illuminating session.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.476
Feel safe, people.

13:11.516 --> 13:13.950
There are no externs here.

13:13.985 --> 13:14.974
They're distractions.

13:15.053 --> 13:16.418
What is an ''extern''?

13:16.454 --> 13:18.149
An outsider critical

13:18.189 --> 13:19.486
of someone else's
search for meaning.

13:19.524 --> 13:21.321
Oh, right, of course.

13:21.359 --> 13:22.656
Now, the title of ''professor''

13:22.694 --> 13:24.594
doesn't begin to convey
the importance of this man

13:24.629 --> 13:25.596
in each of our lives.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.827
Please welcome Patrick Finley.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.810
l have three words for you:

13:41.846 --> 13:47.011
We... have... evolved.

13:47.051 --> 13:48.245
Yes!

13:54.525 --> 13:56.152
What do you think,
you want to get

13:56.194 --> 13:57.684
a little breakfast
before we head back?

13:57.729 --> 13:58.991
What do you mean ''we''?

13:59.030 --> 14:00.554
l've seen you drive
that thing, Junior.

14:00.598 --> 14:03.294
l'm not gonna let you
head back by yourself.

14:03.334 --> 14:04.392
Ah, you're worried
about me?

14:04.435 --> 14:05.561
That's very sweet.

14:05.603 --> 14:07.434
Not really. l just
promised George

14:07.472 --> 14:09.099
l'd get his bike
back in one piece.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.232
Sounds a little more like it.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.505
Okay, if you do die,

14:12.543 --> 14:14.977
l don't want to be the one
to have to tell your family.

14:15.079 --> 14:17.206
l don't want to ruin
your little road trip, man.

14:17.248 --> 14:19.045
So don't.
Let's keep going.

14:21.352 --> 14:23.786
You sure? You really
want to keep going?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.186
Yeah, l'm sure.
Why not?

14:25.223 --> 14:27.748
l mean, l'm stuck with you
for the rest of the day,

14:27.792 --> 14:29.020
and you're stuck
with me, so...

14:30.795 --> 14:32.786
-All right.
-Yeah.

14:34.799 --> 14:36.767
No more usage of the ''K'' word.

14:36.801 --> 14:39.201
You got it, Jack.

15:01.392 --> 15:04.361
And so, about 40,000 years ago,

15:04.395 --> 15:07.330
some Neanderthals decided
to go hunting in a group,

15:07.365 --> 15:10.926
and voila, modern man was born.

15:10.969 --> 15:12.266
Now, l don't know about you,

15:12.303 --> 15:13.964
but l have trouble saying
''modern''

15:14.072 --> 15:16.131
and ''40,000 years ago''
in the same breath.

15:16.174 --> 15:19.974
Let's face it, a lot can happen
in 2,000 generations.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.773
Shopping's looking
better and better.

15:21.813 --> 15:23.337
Shh! l want to hear this.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.942
What we are
is something else entirely.

15:26.985 --> 15:29.977
We feel it every day
of our lives:

15:30.088 --> 15:32.989
the possibility
of something greater.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.618
We are, each of us...

15:36.661 --> 15:39.289
homo lucens--

15:39.330 --> 15:40.957
shining man.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.091
Oh, brother.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.430
But we're in limbo,
aren't we?

15:43.468 --> 15:44.765
Valerie.

15:44.802 --> 15:47.635
Cut off from our past,
unable to reach our destiny,

15:47.672 --> 15:51.836
incapable of changing
even our own lives.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.005
And by the way,

15:55.113 --> 15:56.580
l wouldn't make it sound so dire

15:56.614 --> 15:59.811
if there wasn't something
we can do about it.

15:59.851 --> 16:02.012
Sara, Dan, let's get
some groups going here.

16:02.053 --> 16:04.681
Do things a little different.

16:04.722 --> 16:10.126
l want each of us to go home
tonight transformed.

16:10.161 --> 16:13.961
That is definitely my cue
to hasta la vista.

16:14.065 --> 16:15.430
You're leaving?

16:15.466 --> 16:18.435
''Shining man''?
Who's he kidding?

16:18.469 --> 16:19.868
Kelly,

16:19.904 --> 16:20.962
can you give me a hand here?

16:21.072 --> 16:22.061
Yeah.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.903
To each his own.

16:25.777 --> 16:30.544
Kel, don't let her
influence you.

16:30.581 --> 16:32.412
Do you know
what l'm saying?

16:32.450 --> 16:33.712
Yeah.

16:33.751 --> 16:34.911
lf you're trying

16:34.952 --> 16:37.750
to change your life,
the last thing you need

16:37.789 --> 16:39.689
is some negator
holding you back.

16:42.693 --> 16:43.921
You're right.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.372
ls it running all right?

16:58.409 --> 16:59.376
lt's running great.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.935
l, on the other hand,
am dying.

17:01.979 --> 17:02.968
Yeah.

17:17.795 --> 17:20.855
Look at that.
200 miles from nowhere,

17:20.897 --> 17:21.865
still ''No Trespassing.''

17:21.898 --> 17:22.866
Hey, everything from

17:22.900 --> 17:24.265
the mountains to the beach

17:24.301 --> 17:25.359
is just real estate, man.

17:25.403 --> 17:27.734
Somebody owns
every square inch of it.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.069
Yeah, well, right now,

17:29.107 --> 17:31.837
this square yard belongs
to me, my brother.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.639
Guess again.

17:39.217 --> 17:40.878
This is the lngesaw reservation.

17:40.918 --> 17:43.113
That's scared burial ground
you're flooding.

17:46.157 --> 17:47.124
Oh, man.

17:47.158 --> 17:48.648
Oh, man.

17:50.428 --> 17:51.827
You mean this is some

17:51.863 --> 17:53.160
kind of cemetery?

17:53.197 --> 17:54.596
Shouldn't you guys, like,
mark it or something?

17:54.632 --> 17:56.600
What do you think that is?

18:03.374 --> 18:04.705
Listen,
we're really sorry.

18:04.742 --> 18:06.107
Let me see your licenses.

18:06.144 --> 18:07.941
What? You're, you're
gonna give me a ticket?

18:08.045 --> 18:12.277
Shh! Here you go, Officer,
no problem.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.313
One down, one to go.

18:26.664 --> 18:27.995
Stay here.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.731
That's great, man,
he's got our licenses.

18:30.768 --> 18:32.258
You didn't even think
to ask to see a badge

18:32.303 --> 18:33.600
-or anything?
-Oh, l'm sorry, l forgot

18:33.638 --> 18:34.866
you were the expert in dealing
with law enforcement.

18:34.906 --> 18:35.964
Expert?

18:36.007 --> 18:37.372
Who's the one
that decided to pull in

18:37.408 --> 18:38.705
and take a leak
on a sacred tree?

18:38.743 --> 18:39.869
Hey, if it was up to me,
we'd be home by now.

18:39.911 --> 18:40.969
Listen to you!
You make a mistake,

18:41.012 --> 18:41.979
you can't even admit it?!

18:42.013 --> 18:43.207
The only mistake l made

18:43.247 --> 18:44.737
was coming on this trip
with you.

18:44.782 --> 18:46.750
Oh, you know, you
are such a baby!

18:46.784 --> 18:48.945
Here comes the chief.

18:48.986 --> 18:50.977
l could arrest you for illegal
trespass on a reservation

18:51.088 --> 18:52.578
and desecrating
a religious shrine,

18:52.623 --> 18:53.988
but maybe there's a better way.

18:54.025 --> 18:57.688
Like, uh, we, uh, you know,
pay a fine, make a donation?

18:57.728 --> 18:58.820
No. Work detail.

18:58.863 --> 19:01.161
Chain gang?
Dude...

19:01.199 --> 19:02.166
We'll take it.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.191
Follow me.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.608
l guess l'm beginning to wonder
what l'm doing here.

19:17.648 --> 19:22.381
l mean not here,
on the planet, just here.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.911
Then let's get back
to the fire.

19:24.956 --> 19:28.949
You said you thought your life
would be different afterwards.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.017
How?

19:32.263 --> 19:35.494
My mother was a model,
so growing up,

19:35.533 --> 19:38.400
l was always really worried
about how l looked.

19:38.436 --> 19:42.372
And part of me still thinks
that that's important.

19:44.408 --> 19:48.845
But compared to almost dying
in a fire,

19:48.879 --> 19:51.245
it seems pretty meaningless.

19:51.282 --> 19:53.842
Well, not meaningless.

19:53.884 --> 19:55.784
lt's a big part of everyone's
life, but...

19:55.820 --> 19:56.878
Listen up!

19:56.921 --> 20:00.618
We are trying to create a moment
of clarity

20:00.658 --> 20:04.526
by sharing one truth
about our own lives.

20:04.562 --> 20:06.530
lt's that simple.

20:06.564 --> 20:08.589
Don't analyze.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.295
Oh, is that
what l was doing?

20:11.335 --> 20:12.632
Please.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.934
Look, are you happy
with your life?

20:17.074 --> 20:19.907
Just give me a simple answer
to my simple question.

20:19.944 --> 20:22.310
lt's not a simple question.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.008
Believe me, it is.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.414
But everyone's life is...

20:27.451 --> 20:28.543
Forget about everyone.

20:28.586 --> 20:31.316
You don't know about everyone.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.686
Tell me about you.

20:34.592 --> 20:37.857
lt will never be easier
than right this second.

20:37.895 --> 20:43.162
Set aside your fears,
Kelly; tell the truth.

20:54.412 --> 20:57.711
ln the fire...

20:57.748 --> 21:00.911
when the flames came
through the door,

21:00.951 --> 21:05.320
everything stopped for me.

21:05.356 --> 21:07.688
l could hear my own thoughts.

21:10.027 --> 21:11.995
And l was thinking,

21:12.029 --> 21:16.329
''Please, God,
don't burn my face.

21:16.367 --> 21:19.564
Burn the other girl if you
have to, but don't take me.''

21:23.207 --> 21:28.008
This other girl, Alison,
had saved my life,

21:28.045 --> 21:30.036
and that's what
l was thinking.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.241
And she nearly died.

21:39.390 --> 21:42.689
l want to change my life...

21:42.727 --> 21:44.388
but l don't know how.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.234
Okay, boys,

21:51.268 --> 21:53.031
what we need to have

21:53.070 --> 21:57.234
is a hole this size
in the shape of a circle,

21:57.274 --> 22:00.368
exactly one foot deep.

22:00.411 --> 22:01.639
lt's gonna
take all day.

22:01.679 --> 22:04.648
Make that two feet deep.
Pile the dirt up over here.

22:06.016 --> 22:07.745
The sides have
to be perfectly...

22:07.785 --> 22:11.846
The bottom has to be
perfectly...

22:11.889 --> 22:12.913
Here's the tape.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.982
Got some shovels?

22:15.025 --> 22:16.356
Over here.

22:27.238 --> 22:28.296
Here, Dylan.

22:31.709 --> 22:33.768
Thanks a lot.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.005
Don't you have
one for me?

22:35.045 --> 22:36.171
You supervise.

22:36.213 --> 22:40.013
Make sure that the sides
are perfectly...

22:40.050 --> 22:41.984
That the bottom
is perfectly...

22:42.019 --> 22:43.748
l'll be back
to check on you.

22:46.390 --> 22:48.255
Wait,

22:48.292 --> 22:49.589
l have to do
all the digging?

22:49.627 --> 22:51.254
Ask your supervisor.

22:58.736 --> 23:00.704
What's that
supposed to mean?

23:00.738 --> 23:02.069
Come on. You're
a bright boy.

23:02.106 --> 23:03.300
Figure it out.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.309
Dylan, the guy has
our driver's licenses.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.970
We said we'd do work detail.

23:08.078 --> 23:10.808
Oh, no, Brandon. You
said we'd do work detail.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.372
All right, when
the guy comes back,

23:12.416 --> 23:13.849
we'll tell him
we'd rather be arrested

23:13.884 --> 23:16.182
on a reservation where,
for all l know,

23:16.220 --> 23:18.552
the United States Constitution
doesn't even apply.

23:18.589 --> 23:20.216
Okay.

23:20.257 --> 23:21.383
l'll dig the hole.

23:21.425 --> 23:22.983
l will dig the hole,

23:23.093 --> 23:26.392
but there is no way
you are supervising me.

23:26.430 --> 23:27.795
You got it?

23:35.573 --> 23:37.541
The ground's hard
as a rock!

23:37.575 --> 23:38.599
Dylan...

23:38.642 --> 23:40.109
Shut up. l mean it.

23:40.144 --> 23:42.135
Don't even talk to me
right now, Brandon.

23:51.322 --> 23:52.846
Hey, Steve.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.255
Donna?

23:54.291 --> 23:56.020
ls our telethon committee
meeting now?

23:56.126 --> 23:58.424
Uh, no, not till
next week.

23:58.462 --> 24:01.431
Actually, l just, l, l came
to pick your brain.

24:01.465 --> 24:04.764
Well, it's better than
picking my nose, isn't it?

24:04.802 --> 24:06.770
Um, remember when we
were in high school,

24:06.804 --> 24:08.965
at the Pigskin Prom, when
you were David's manager,

24:09.039 --> 24:10.472
and right before
he went on,

24:10.508 --> 24:11.907
he was really nervous?

24:11.942 --> 24:13.773
What, what'd you
say to him?

24:13.811 --> 24:15.972
l told him, ''Get out there,
or l'll break your fingers.''

24:16.080 --> 24:17.513
lt seemed to do the trick.

24:17.548 --> 24:19.675
Well, do you think you
could say that to Ray?

24:19.717 --> 24:21.184
He's supposed to go
on tomorrow night,

24:21.218 --> 24:22.549
but he's paralyzed
with stage fright,

24:22.586 --> 24:23.985
and l don't know
what to do.

24:24.021 --> 24:25.545
Why don't you
just sleep with him?

24:25.589 --> 24:26.681
Funny.

24:26.724 --> 24:27.918
No, it's not funny.

24:27.958 --> 24:29.357
And, frankly, it's quite
insensitive of you

24:29.393 --> 24:30.792
to come here
and ask me advice

24:30.828 --> 24:32.295
on anything even
remotely connected

24:32.329 --> 24:33.591
with the Peach Pit After Dark!

24:33.631 --> 24:35.758
l'm sorry.
l just assumed...

24:35.799 --> 24:37.426
Well, don't assume!
Don't assume anything

24:37.468 --> 24:39.561
other than it's very painful
for me to watch you,

24:39.603 --> 24:41.230
David and Clare...

24:41.272 --> 24:43.001
This was my idea!

24:43.107 --> 24:45.667
And now it's Rush's idea?

24:45.709 --> 24:47.700
Don't assume anything, okay?

24:47.745 --> 24:49.736
Okay.

24:51.715 --> 24:53.114
Donna...

24:53.150 --> 24:54.549
if you really want
to motivate him,

24:54.585 --> 24:56.610
why don't you just shave
your head like Susan Powter?

24:56.654 --> 24:59.623
Yeah, l'll keep
that in mind.

24:59.657 --> 25:00.954
No, seriously,

25:00.991 --> 25:02.822
if you really want
to get through to him,

25:02.860 --> 25:05.829
really make an impact,
inspire him,

25:05.863 --> 25:07.387
go to the source,

25:07.431 --> 25:09.126
-the master!
-The who?

25:09.166 --> 25:10.565
Vince Lombardi.

25:10.601 --> 25:11.932
Vince Lombardi?

25:11.969 --> 25:16.668
Vince Lombardi.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.457
How's he doing?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.788
Great.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.794
Fantastic.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.796
Do you really think
he's doing a good job?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.263
Yeah, absolutely.

25:41.298 --> 25:43.266
Are the sides...

25:43.300 --> 25:45.268
And the bottom's...

25:45.302 --> 25:47.270
Are they really?

25:47.304 --> 25:49.272
No.

25:49.306 --> 25:51.001
No, no, not really.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.838
Oh, you lunatics!

25:52.876 --> 25:55.743
The two of you can do whatever
you want to do with this hole.

25:55.779 --> 25:57.110
l'm not digging anymore.

25:57.147 --> 25:58.739
-Bro...
-Don't ''bro'' me.

25:58.782 --> 26:00.181
We're not talking, remember?
And you, what is this?

26:00.217 --> 26:01.343
All of a sudden
l give up

26:01.385 --> 26:02.579
all my rights?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.144
There's no such thing
as forced labor,

26:04.188 --> 26:07.180
and if there was,
l ain't it.

26:08.492 --> 26:11.461
That's one
pissed-off kid.

26:11.495 --> 26:13.463
Yep.

26:13.497 --> 26:16.295
Well, you'd better
get a move on.

26:16.333 --> 26:19.234
At this rate, you're gonna
be here all night.

26:19.269 --> 26:21.260
Whoa, whoa, wait
a minute, sir.

26:21.305 --> 26:23.205
This doesn't seem
to be working very well.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.174
lsn't there some other way
we can make amends?

26:25.209 --> 26:27.177
Not really. Not for
what you've done.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.202
lt's your responsibility,
Brandon.

26:34.551 --> 26:35.848
Look, bro,

26:35.886 --> 26:37.444
l agree this is
totally unfair,

26:37.488 --> 26:38.921
but what am l
supposed to do?

26:38.956 --> 26:40.548
Oh, no, just do
what you've been doing.

26:40.591 --> 26:42.081
Sit there fat and lazy
while l'm sweating

26:42.126 --> 26:43.753
-my ass off.
-Fine, let me dig.

26:43.794 --> 26:44.920
Uh-uh. No way.

26:44.962 --> 26:46.429
Why, so l can hear you
for the rest of my life

26:46.463 --> 26:47.623
telling everybody
how you bailed me out?

26:47.665 --> 26:48.996
-l don't think so.
-Hey,

26:49.033 --> 26:51.263
it's my fault we're in
this situation, okay?

26:51.301 --> 26:53.201
So, let me dig for a while.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.704
When he comes back,
we'll switch places.

26:59.877 --> 27:01.868
Okay, for a while.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.775
Thanks.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.585
-So what's the deal with Donna?
-Well,

27:19.630 --> 27:21.825
the good news is,
she's not going nuts.

27:21.865 --> 27:24.857
At least not in the
way we thought.

27:24.902 --> 27:26.597
So, then what was
all the yelling about?

27:26.637 --> 27:27.968
l'm getting this
sinking feeling

27:28.038 --> 27:30.336
our opening act may
have a slight problem

27:30.374 --> 27:31.739
performing in front
of a crowd.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.107
Are you telling me,
Ray has stage fright?

27:34.144 --> 27:36.635
You said it, l didn't.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.649
So, how worried about this
should we be?

27:39.683 --> 27:42.652
Well, right now, she's
in my room watching a videotape

27:42.686 --> 27:44.984
of some old football coach
giving his players a pep talk

27:45.022 --> 27:46.250
before the big game, so...

27:46.290 --> 27:48.258
Let's have a little chat
with Donna.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.281
Yeah.

27:50.327 --> 27:51.954
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Kel.

27:51.995 --> 27:53.963
The most amazing thing
happened to me today.

27:53.997 --> 27:55.294
Professor Finley said
it was practically

27:55.332 --> 27:57.323
-a ''breakthrough ascendancy.''
-A what?

27:57.367 --> 28:00.268
Clare, can you get
in here, please?

28:00.304 --> 28:01.931
Hold that thought.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.166
Sorry, but knowing

28:03.207 --> 28:04.902
that you're expecting
a 30 year-old videotape

28:04.942 --> 28:07.911
of Vince Lombardi
to help you motivate Ray...

28:07.945 --> 28:10.243
l don't know, it just
makes me a little nervous.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.248
Well, don't be.

28:12.282 --> 28:14.250
l've got it
under control.

28:14.284 --> 28:15.774
Hi, Kel. How was
the workshop?

28:15.819 --> 28:16.945
Fantastic.

28:17.054 --> 28:18.351
Finley is one of the most

28:18.388 --> 28:19.855
remarkable people
l've ever met.

28:19.890 --> 28:22.188
Well, maybe we can
get him to help Ray.

28:22.226 --> 28:23.215
Okay. You know what?

28:23.260 --> 28:24.420
Why don't you leave

28:24.461 --> 28:25.860
and l'm just gonna do
my homework, okay?

28:25.896 --> 28:27.591
l'll see you later.
Bye-bye.

28:27.631 --> 28:29.690
Bye-bye.

28:29.733 --> 28:31.701
Do you mind?

28:31.735 --> 28:32.963
Uh, David and l need

28:33.070 --> 28:34.970
to have a quick
powwow in private.

28:35.072 --> 28:36.539
Oh, be my guest.

28:39.243 --> 28:43.942
l'll just go for a walk and tell
the seagulls how happy l am.

28:45.449 --> 28:49.476
What do you figure
this hole is for anyway?

28:49.520 --> 28:52.489
To hide
our decomposing bodies.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.491
l just don't get what
we're doing here, man.

28:54.525 --> 28:57.551
Well, young Brandon, think
of it as a Zen exercise.

28:57.594 --> 28:59.994
And here l thought it was
because you broke the law.

29:04.635 --> 29:06.899
So you decided to leap in
there and help him out, huh?

29:06.937 --> 29:11.738
Yeah, l, l know it's not
what we agreed on,

29:11.775 --> 29:13.572
but Dylan needed
some help and...

29:13.610 --> 29:16.272
Dylan, what l want
to know is,

29:16.313 --> 29:17.780
where Brandon is digging,

29:17.815 --> 29:19.544
are the sides...

29:19.583 --> 29:20.948
and is the bottom...

29:20.984 --> 29:22.246
Are they?

29:22.286 --> 29:27.883
Uh, no, no, what they
are is, uh, uniformly bad.

29:27.925 --> 29:29.085
But that's an accomplishment

29:29.126 --> 29:31.219
in itself, l suppose.

29:33.297 --> 29:34.355
You're done here.

29:34.398 --> 29:35.365
We are?

29:35.399 --> 29:36.491
You mean we can leave?

29:36.533 --> 29:37.761
You can do what you want.

29:37.801 --> 29:39.496
But l'd like to invite you
to stay.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.633
Nice hole.

30:11.668 --> 30:13.966
You know, l've heard
of a sweat lodge before.

30:14.004 --> 30:17.462
l always pictured something
a little bigger, you know.

30:17.507 --> 30:19.168
Listen, we're
really honored

30:19.209 --> 30:22.872
that you invited us to stay
and everything, but, uh...

30:22.913 --> 30:24.278
What's gonna go on in there?

30:24.314 --> 30:25.906
Well, it's different
for each person.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.510
Our tribe believes that when the
Creator sat in the sweat lodge,

30:29.553 --> 30:32.784
that human beings were formed
from droplets of the sweat.

30:32.823 --> 30:34.791
Obviously, nothing that dramatic
is gonna happen today.

30:34.825 --> 30:36.122
Well, what is gonna happen?

30:36.159 --> 30:39.094
Well, to say the very least,
you'll sweat a lot.

30:43.333 --> 30:44.630
Well, l don't know about this.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.397
l mean, those rocks
are white-hot.

30:46.436 --> 30:48.028
Come on,
you're a tough guy.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.298
You can handle it.

30:49.339 --> 30:50.465
Yeah, l'm Minnesota tough.

30:50.507 --> 30:53.840
20, 30 below, l can
handle, but this...

30:53.877 --> 30:56.675
l'm seriously thinking
about bowing out.

30:56.713 --> 30:58.544
You want to tell our host?

31:08.392 --> 31:10.587
Who needs the Peach Pit
After Dark anyway?

31:10.627 --> 31:12.117
-Muntz...
-No, seriously, man.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.527
l told Baumgartner and Noble

31:13.563 --> 31:14.996
they had a brother
that got burned

31:15.032 --> 31:17.557
by that place, and if they
went to the opening tonight,

31:17.601 --> 31:19.569
they'd just be sticking
a knife in your back.

31:19.603 --> 31:22.367
But they went anyway, right?

31:22.406 --> 31:23.873
Well, they're dirtballs, man.

31:23.907 --> 31:24.896
Who needs them?

31:24.942 --> 31:27.843
Why don't you go
to the club, too?

31:27.878 --> 31:29.140
You sure?

31:30.147 --> 31:32.308
Thanks, man, thanks.

31:33.750 --> 31:34.739
Hey, Mr. Sanders.

31:34.785 --> 31:36.685
What do you say, kid?

31:41.358 --> 31:42.347
What do you want?

31:42.392 --> 31:44.019
How about two minutes?

31:44.061 --> 31:45.358
To do what?

31:45.395 --> 31:46.919
Tell you how sorry l am.

31:46.964 --> 31:49.762
Well... well, thanks.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.825
l... l feel a lot better now.

31:51.868 --> 31:55.497
Well, l'm glad you do
'cause l feel lousy.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.736
Please, l saw you
at the club, holding court.

31:58.775 --> 32:00.766
Why don't you
just go back there,

32:00.811 --> 32:02.506
flirt with Donna and Clare
a little more,

32:02.546 --> 32:04.480
show them what a standup guy
you really are?

32:04.514 --> 32:06.641
Steve, l didn't mean to cut you
out of the picture.

32:06.683 --> 32:08.514
Yes, you did!

32:08.552 --> 32:09.814
lt's why you made that deal.

32:09.853 --> 32:11.320
l tried to keep you
from getting busted!

32:11.355 --> 32:12.845
lt was the best deal
l could make!

32:12.889 --> 32:14.254
That was the best you could do?!

32:14.291 --> 32:15.315
Yes!

32:15.359 --> 32:17.793
Yeah.

32:17.828 --> 32:21.992
You think Ted Stone
and his attorneys listen to me?

32:23.967 --> 32:27.459
All l am to them is
Samantha Sanders' ex-husband.

32:33.410 --> 32:36.345
Listen, l really
don't give a damn

32:36.380 --> 32:39.508
how popular this joint gets,

32:39.549 --> 32:41.244
'cause it doesn't mean
anything to me

32:41.284 --> 32:43.013
unless you're there
being a part of it.

32:43.120 --> 32:48.285
Yeah, well, l'm not allowed
to be, thanks to you.

32:49.826 --> 32:51.623
l don't know about that.

32:51.661 --> 32:54.027
l, um, l really don't think
a magistrate's gonna

32:54.131 --> 32:56.122
be there checking lDs tonight,
do you?

32:57.801 --> 33:00.964
Come on.
Come to the club with me.

33:03.306 --> 33:05.536
You're not exactly my idea
of a dream date,

33:05.575 --> 33:08.635
but... you buy, l'll fly.

33:08.678 --> 33:11.112
Come here.

33:12.482 --> 33:14.541
Dad.

33:24.594 --> 33:26.721
How you doing?

33:26.763 --> 33:28.993
l think l might make it.

33:31.535 --> 33:32.729
l think we're gonna die.

33:32.769 --> 33:33.793
Yeah.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.248
Grandfather, we are happy
to be here.

33:50.287 --> 33:51.720
This is not a contest.

33:51.755 --> 33:54.019
So, if it gets too hot,
you can get out.

33:54.057 --> 33:57.584
But you're here to pray for
your heart and not your mind.

33:57.627 --> 34:03.497
Grandfather... we ask
for good health and help.

34:18.581 --> 34:20.106
lt's your turn to pray.

34:20.150 --> 34:22.482
Hey, Dylan, you're up.

34:23.954 --> 34:29.859
Uh, Grandfather, l didn't know

34:29.893 --> 34:31.588
if anybody had been
looking out for me

34:31.628 --> 34:33.322
the last couple of months,

34:33.362 --> 34:41.327
but l guess now they have or l
wouldn't be alive to be here.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.534
Thank you.

34:47.944 --> 34:49.536
Next man pray.

34:53.016 --> 34:56.645
Grandfather, uh...

34:56.686 --> 34:58.244
l don't really know what to say

34:58.288 --> 35:03.885
except... l'm really glad
my friend Dylan is still here,

35:03.927 --> 35:06.862
so we could do this together.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.626
l'll never forget it.

35:11.935 --> 35:15.029
By the way,
this heat's really something.

35:38.962 --> 35:39.929
Hey, Clare!

35:39.963 --> 35:41.294
Hi!

35:41.331 --> 35:43.162
You guys have done an
incredible job with this place.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.191
Yeah, it sure beats
changing diapers.

35:45.235 --> 35:46.725
We were hoping it would.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.761
lt almost makes me nostalgic
for my bartending days.

35:48.805 --> 35:50.705
No, no, no, those bartending
days are over, babe.

35:50.740 --> 35:51.900
Hey, if you change

35:51.942 --> 35:53.239
your mind, make sure
you let us know, okay?

35:53.276 --> 35:55.107
All right.
When does Ray go on?

35:55.145 --> 35:56.237
Actually, l was

35:56.279 --> 35:57.678
just gonna go talk
to David about that.

35:57.714 --> 35:58.976
Can l catch you guys in a bit?

35:59.015 --> 36:00.004
Yeah, sure.
We'll go dance.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.278
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

36:07.691 --> 36:09.955
So what did Ray have
to say for himself?

36:09.993 --> 36:11.517
Nothing.

36:11.561 --> 36:14.496
But he's a quiet guy, so that's
not necessarily a bad sign.

36:14.531 --> 36:16.089
Donna swears
he's gonna be okay.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.963
Clare, would you look
at this place? lt's jumping.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.060
l mean, people are having
the time of their lives.

36:20.103 --> 36:21.968
Why should we risk Ray
going down in flames?

36:22.038 --> 36:25.132
Who came up with this whole
live music thing, anyway?

36:25.175 --> 36:27.439
Well, if you want to be
the one to tell Donna

36:27.477 --> 36:30.037
Ray can't can't perform
tonight, be my guest.

36:32.949 --> 36:34.177
Now, when you hear the intro,

36:34.217 --> 36:36.276
the band will come out
in this formation,

36:36.319 --> 36:38.981
and you follow Stow
over to your amplifier.

36:39.055 --> 36:40.886
Donna, what are
all these diagrams about?

36:40.924 --> 36:42.221
Now when you start playing,
remember,

36:42.259 --> 36:43.658
you're not Ray Pruit anymore.

36:43.693 --> 36:45.285
You're Paul Hornung.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.920
Who is Paul Hornung?

36:46.963 --> 36:48.453
He used to play
for the Green Bay Packers,

36:48.498 --> 36:49.556
but that's not what's important.

36:49.599 --> 36:51.226
What's important
is, you're not

36:51.268 --> 36:52.599
in the Peach Pit
After Dark anymore.

36:52.636 --> 36:54.763
You're in the Super Bowl,
and you've got the ball.

36:54.804 --> 36:56.999
And everyone else out here,
they want to hurt you,

36:57.073 --> 36:59.633
but you're not gonna let them.
You want to know why?

36:59.676 --> 37:00.540
l'm afraid to ask.

37:00.577 --> 37:01.737
'Cause you're the best.

37:01.778 --> 37:03.905
You've wanted to be in this game
your whole life.

37:03.947 --> 37:06.347
You know deep down
that winning isn't everything,

37:06.383 --> 37:07.941
it's the only thing.

37:07.984 --> 37:10.145
Now come here, give me a kiss.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.381
Get your butt out there
onstage.

37:12.422 --> 37:13.389
All right.

37:13.423 --> 37:14.822
Whoo!

37:14.858 --> 37:17.827
You know, yesterday
l didn't even realize

37:17.861 --> 37:19.726
how beautiful this place is.

37:19.763 --> 37:21.321
Yeah.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.525
So what's next,
Lake Whitney?

37:23.566 --> 37:25.431
l don't know.

37:25.468 --> 37:27.800
l think anything would be
a little anticlimactic

37:27.837 --> 37:29.361
after the old sweat lodge.

37:29.406 --> 37:30.464
Yeah.

37:30.507 --> 37:32.668
But l can't remember
the last time

37:32.709 --> 37:35.200
l didn't actually
dread going home.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.074
l hate to admit it,

37:38.114 --> 37:39.638
but, uh, l learned a lot

37:39.683 --> 37:41.275
on this little adventure
of ours, too.

37:41.318 --> 37:43.183
Yep, look before you leak.

37:44.621 --> 37:46.589
Absolutely.

37:46.623 --> 37:49.854
You know... when l thought

37:49.893 --> 37:52.384
that somehow you could
dig the perfect hole

37:52.429 --> 37:53.987
any better than l could,

37:54.097 --> 37:57.191
even though l somehow assumed
it would be easier for you,

37:57.233 --> 38:00.100
it hit me... we're all flawed.

38:00.136 --> 38:03.594
Nobody's perfect, not me,
not you, not anybody.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.200
Which is obvious,
but once in a while,

38:06.242 --> 38:08.676
you just need
a little reminder.

38:08.712 --> 38:10.475
Could be.

38:10.513 --> 38:14.279
But don't you think the point
was more that you assumed

38:14.317 --> 38:17.309
l was out to get you
even though l wasn't?

38:17.354 --> 38:19.879
And that maybe if you give
people the benefit of the doubt,

38:19.923 --> 38:21.618
you find out
they're really on your side?

38:21.658 --> 38:23.956
Yeah, anything's possible.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.618
Possible?

38:25.662 --> 38:27.095
Oh, l'm sorry,
''nobody's perfect''

38:27.130 --> 38:28.688
is supposed to be
a major revelation?

38:28.732 --> 38:32.828
Okay, Brandon, l think maybe
we'd better just, you know...

38:32.869 --> 38:35.099
Talk less and ride more.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.232
You talk less,
l'll ride more.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.707
Uh-huh, yeah.

38:39.743 --> 38:42.712
You just try to keep me off
your tailpipe today, my friend.

38:42.746 --> 38:43.735
Yeah.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.441
And l use that term
very loosely.

38:45.482 --> 38:46.972
Good luck.

39:00.029 --> 39:02.259
Hello?

39:02.298 --> 39:04.732
Oh, hi.
l didn't want to disturb you.

39:04.768 --> 39:06.065
Well, you didn't.

39:06.102 --> 39:07.399
Please, come in.

39:07.437 --> 39:09.405
lt's Kelly, right?

39:09.439 --> 39:11.703
Kelly Taylor.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.370
Usually, l'm terrible
with names,

39:16.413 --> 39:19.177
but you l remember.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.285
So, what's in the envelope?

39:23.319 --> 39:25.184
Would you mind
reading that later?

39:27.257 --> 39:30.226
Okay, though l'm dying
of curiosity.

39:30.260 --> 39:33.889
Well, l just wanted
to let you know how much

39:33.930 --> 39:35.898
l appreciated the workshop.

39:35.932 --> 39:37.957
Maybe l got
a little carried away there.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.932
You don't have to thank me.

39:39.969 --> 39:42.267
What happened at the workshop
was all you.

39:42.305 --> 39:44.136
That'd be nice
if that were true.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.266
lt's true.

39:45.308 --> 39:47.868
When you really need
to find something,

39:47.911 --> 39:50.903
suddenly there it is,

39:50.947 --> 39:52.972
where it's always been.

39:53.049 --> 39:55.540
Believe me, l know.

39:55.585 --> 39:58.884
Can l ask you kind of
a personal question?

39:58.922 --> 40:00.981
Take a chance.

40:01.057 --> 40:05.790
When you ended up
in a wheelchair,

40:05.829 --> 40:08.263
is that when
you started evolving?

40:09.632 --> 40:12.624
Well, hopefully, that's been
going on my entire life,

40:12.669 --> 40:17.629
but the accident, well...
l don't want to give you

40:17.674 --> 40:21.007
the wrong impression
because l truly love to ski.

40:21.077 --> 40:27.016
But, you know, from the fire,
it is a gift to have something

40:27.083 --> 40:29.415
suddenly put
your whole life into focus.

40:29.452 --> 40:35.015
Right now, all l see is that
l'm not really who l want to be.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.253
Well, fortunately,
you're still evolving.

40:44.033 --> 40:45.933
You can change your life, Kelly.

40:47.303 --> 40:50.295
But l should warn you,

40:50.340 --> 40:53.138
a lot of people are not gonna
understand what you're after.

40:53.176 --> 40:55.736
l don't care.

40:55.778 --> 40:57.678
That's what l want to do.

41:02.719 --> 41:04.778
Oh, man, my arms
are killing me.

41:04.821 --> 41:06.288
Yeah. Can l get you
something to drink?

41:06.322 --> 41:08.586
Right after l hit
the nearest sacred tree, bro.

41:08.625 --> 41:11.685
Yeah, the ficus in the bathroom,
it's always been lucky for me.

41:18.835 --> 41:20.427
lt's me-- Jonesy.

41:20.470 --> 41:22.563
l'm at the Lost and Found
with eight million dollars

41:22.605 --> 41:24.129
l think you might recognize.

41:24.173 --> 41:25.640
Grab your passport
and some shades

41:25.675 --> 41:27.905
and get your boots down here
without telling anyone.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.104
Call me. My number is...
