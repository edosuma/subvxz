WEBVTT

00:14.215 --> 00:16.415
I ASSUME YOU'VE HEARD.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.184
THAT RIDGEWOOD IS HOSTING
A BATTLE OF THE BANDS?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.786
OF COURSE I HAVE. HAVE YOU?

00:20.788 --> 00:25.357
I WOULDN'T HAVE JUST
SAID THAT IF I HADN'T.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.460
WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.397
NO ONE. YOU?

00:31.399 --> 00:33.332
NO ONE.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.336
(snaps fingers) MINIONS,
SECRET BISTRO MEETING.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.247
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ARTIE?

00:48.249 --> 00:50.949
TO PUT THE BAND BACK TOGETHER.

00:50.951 --> 00:54.653
ARTIE AND I WEREN'T
ALWAYS SWORN ENEMIES.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.723
IN SEVENTH GRADE,
WE WERE IN A BAND.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.560
CORRECTION. WE WERE
IN THE MOST AWESOME BAND EVER.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.229
WE CALLED OURSELVES ACNE.

01:04.231 --> 01:09.001
OUR ROCK ANTHEM
<i>POP THE PIMPLE  </i> WAS NUMBER ONE
ON THE MIDDLE SCHOOL CHARTS.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.869
WHO KNOWS HOW FAR
WE COULD HAVE GONE?

01:10.871 --> 01:15.641
BUT WE BROKE UP
BECAUSE SOMEBODY
HAD A BIT OF AN EGO.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.677
EGO; "E" FOR EXCELLENCE,
"G" FOR GREATNESS,

01:18.679 --> 01:21.980
AND "O" FOR
"OH, I'M SO GOOD."

01:21.982 --> 01:25.317
SO WILL YOU SAY YES
TO A REUNION?

01:25.319 --> 01:27.352
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.589
I WANNA SING IT.

I HAVE A PREZZIE FOR YOU.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.931
NO WAY.
A BEJEWELED WELDING MASK.

02:45.933 --> 02:50.402
THIS'LL GO GREAT WITH
THE BEJEWELED BLOW TORCH
YOU GAVE ME LAST MONTH.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.603
I KNOW!

02:51.605 --> 02:53.372
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW HOLDEN.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.876
HOLDEN. YOU KNOW,
THE BOY THAT I SECRETLY LIKE
AND I WAS ABOUT TO ASK OUT,

02:57.878 --> 03:00.045
BUT THEN ANDIE ASKED HIM FIRST
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW
I LIKED HIM,

03:00.047 --> 03:01.980
AND NOW I HAVE TO
AVOID HIM BECAUSE HE'S
DATING MY FRIEND

03:01.982 --> 03:03.549
AND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM
I GET THE CRUSHIES?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.851
THAT HOLDEN.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.353
LIV, WE HAVEN'T
HUNG OUT MUCH LATELY.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.389
DO YOU WANNA GO MINI GOLFING
AFTER SCHOOL?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.624
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.627
I REALLY ONLY SPEND TIME
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEJEWELED WELDING MASKS.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.898
(shouts)
I HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.669
HEY, ANDIE. HEY, LIV.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.704
HEY, HOLDEN.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.973
LIV'S GOING MINI GOLFING
WITH US AFTER SCHOOL.

03:27.975 --> 03:31.076
-OH, AWESOME.
-OH. (laughs)

03:31.078 --> 03:33.078
WE'RE GOING WITH HOLDEN.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.014
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
HOW AMAZING HE IS.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.951
-YOU'RE AMAZING.
-NO, YOU ARE.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.052
STOP.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.120
(laughs)

03:42.122 --> 03:46.024
AW. OH!
WOW, I JUST REALIZED

03:46.026 --> 03:50.796
I HAVE-- I HAVE STUFF
TO DO AFTER SCHOOL.

03:50.798 --> 03:55.033
AND I ALSO HAVE THINGS.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.704
AW, WELL, THAT'S A BUMMER,
BUT OKAY.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.973
-DEFINITELY ANOTHER TIME.
-OKAY.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.108
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH YOUR THINGS.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.179
(laughs)
DON'T FORGET THE STUFF.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.717
-CRUSHIES?
-I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

04:11.719 --> 04:16.054
OKAY. THREE, TWO, ONE.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.490
OF COURSE I'VE GOT
THE CRUSHIES, MADDIE.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.727
IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE
TIME I'M AROUND HOLDEN.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.830
AND I WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH ANDIE. SHE'S JUST--

04:24.832 --> 04:26.431
SHE'S ALWAYS WITH HIM.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.066
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO I DO?

04:28.068 --> 04:31.436
LIV, I THINK JUST
UNTIL YOU GET OVER YOUR
FEELINGS FOR HOLDEN,

04:31.438 --> 04:34.940
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT YOU AND ANDIE CAN DO
WITHOUT HIM, YOU KNOW?

04:34.942 --> 04:38.043
-WHAT UP, MY TWINS?
-HEY!

04:38.045 --> 04:39.945
(kisses)

04:39.947 --> 04:42.014
-WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME
IN THE BATTLE...
-I'M IN!

04:42.016 --> 04:43.949
-OF THE BANDS?
-NO, I'M OUT.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.787
HOW ABOUT YOU, LIV?
YOU SING WHILE I KILL IT
ON THE DRUMS?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.156
WILLS, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU PLAYED THE DRUMS.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.225
YEAH, TOOK IT UP RECENTLY.

04:53.227 --> 04:56.128
NEEDED SOMETHING
TO BEAT WITH A STICK

04:56.130 --> 04:58.697
TO RELEASE YOUR PENT UP
FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT JOEY NOT
RETURNING YOUR AFFECTIONS?

04:58.699 --> 05:01.266
WHY WON'T HE LOVE ME, LIV?
WHY?!

05:05.105 --> 05:09.808
ANYWAYS, THE BATTLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.010
I THINK THAT
ANDIE PLAYS THE BASS,

05:12.012 --> 05:15.647
AND IF WE WERE IN A BAND
TOGETHER, WE COULD HANG OUT
WITHOUT HOLDEN.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.182
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE GUY THAT
I SECRETLY LIKE

05:17.184 --> 05:19.017
AND I WAS ABOUT TO ASK OUT,
BUT--

05:19.019 --> 05:21.653
WAIT, I TOTALLY ALREADY
TOLD YOU GUYS THIS.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.524
OH, HEY, ANDIE, WILLOW
AND I ARE STARTING A BAND.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.992
DO YOU WANT
TO BE IN IT?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.494
YOU BET I DO.
A BAND WITH MY GIRLS?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.197
YES! WE HAVE A BAND.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.566
-YAY! OW!
-OH!

05:37.137 --> 05:39.037
OOPS, WRONG TWIN.
HELP ME.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.213
WHERE'S NIMBUS? WE NEED
TO DO A SOUND CHECK ASAP.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.283
PARDON ME, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY VECTRON FUEL CELL?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.518
I LEFT IT IN HERE AFTER
THE HOVERCRAFT RACES.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.856
-IT'S ABOUT YAY BIG
AND YAY DEADLY.
-(laughs)

05:57.858 --> 06:00.826
YOU GIFTED AND TALENTED KIDS
CRACK ME UP.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.995
HEY, GIVE US A MIC CHECK.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.065
SURE. I MEAN,
I'M NO JOHNNY NIMBUS,

06:07.067 --> 06:11.269
BUT I'LL GIVE IT A--
HELLO, STEVENS POINT,

06:11.271 --> 06:15.040
WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE
FROM THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS...

06:15.042 --> 06:17.843
BANDS... BANDS...

06:20.581 --> 06:23.281
A-BRAVO, A-BRAVO.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.986
BUT YOU LACK
THE NIMBUS FLAIR,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.821
THAT GIVES EVEN
THE DULLEST OF STORIES

06:29.823 --> 06:33.024
A SENSE OF IMPORTANCE.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.011
WELL, THANKS FOR
FILLING IN, KID.

06:36.012 --> 06:38.997
NOW STEP ASIDE.
THE PROFESSIONAL
IS HERE, HERE, HERE.

06:38.999 --> 06:43.835
HEY, DON'T GET CRUSTY BECAUSE
I PRETENDED TO BE YOU.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.205
NOT MY FAULT IF I MADE LIKE
A HAMMER AND NAILED IT.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.208
THE KID WAS PRETTY GOOD,
JOHNNY.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.644
YEAH, I COULD PROBABLY
TAKE YOUR JOB.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.147
(laughs)
LISTEN, KID,

06:55.149 --> 06:58.717
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE
LEGENDARY WEATHERMAN
GUS T. WIND

06:58.719 --> 07:01.420
WAS SUCKED UP IN
A TWISTER BACK IN '97.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.823
THE WAY I INFLECT
TAKES YEARS TO PERFECT.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.160
"THE WAY I INFLECT
TAKES YEARS TO PERFECT."

07:08.162 --> 07:10.195
ALL RIGHT, BEGINNER'S LUCK.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.831
I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN DO THAT
FOR A SENTENCE OR TWO,

07:12.833 --> 07:17.736
BUT TRY SPEWING THIS POWERFUL
ENTHUSIASM, MAKING YOUR
VOICE GO UP AND DOWN

07:17.738 --> 07:19.838
AND ALL ROUND, 24/7.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.008
DUDE, A TRAINED MONKEY
COULD DO THAT.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.845
OH. WELL, I'VE INTERVIEWED
SEVERAL MONKEYS, SMART GUY.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.780
AND TRUST ME,
THEY CAN'T TALK.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.083
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD
TO OUT-NIMBUS THE NIMBUS.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.052
HERE WE GO.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.255
YOU ROONEYS COULD
TURN SITTING DOWN
INTO A COMPETITION.

07:37.257 --> 07:41.092
I SIT BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM.
I SIT LIKE A BOSS.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.929
OKAY, LIL' BOSS,

07:43.931 --> 07:47.165
I CHALLENGE YOU TO A HOST
BATTLE, RIGHT HERE,  <i> MAÑANA.</i>

07:47.167 --> 07:49.167
-YOU'RE ON.
-BOOM! ZAP!

07:49.169 --> 07:52.971
IT'LL BE A BATTLE
OF THE BATTLE OF
THE BANDS HOSTS.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.075
IT'LL BE A MATCH-UP
OF THE MIC MEN.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.177
-SEE, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
-YEAH, BUT I SAID IT BETTER.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.312
(feedback whines)

08:03.317 --> 08:05.150
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT
THIS FOR A NAME--

08:05.152 --> 08:07.986
LIV AND THE BLOWTORCHES?

08:09.723 --> 08:13.425
ANDIE, I DON'T KNOW IF
I NECESSARILY WANNA BE
"LIZ AND THE" ANYTHING.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.093
WE NEED A NAME FOR US.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.196
HOW ABOUT THE DREAM?

08:18.198 --> 08:22.968
'CAUSE IT WAS DUCT TAPED TO
MY BASS DRUM WHEN I BOUGHT
IT AT THE THRIFT SHOP.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.169
WORKS FOR ME.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.771
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
THE DREAM IT IS.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.173
LET'S DO THIS!

08:31.345 --> 08:33.445
OKAY, SO TWO SUMMERS AGO,

08:33.447 --> 08:37.916
I PLAYED LEAD GUITAR
IN THE MOVIE  <i> THE FUNAWAYS.</i>

08:37.918 --> 08:42.087
I MEAN, OKAY, SO I MIMED
PLAYING, BUT HOW HARD
CAN IT BE, RIGHT?

08:42.089 --> 08:45.223
(playing off-key)

08:49.196 --> 08:52.163
-THAT WAS--
-JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.099
I ALREADY KNOW.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.068
I'M ALSO JUST NOW REALIZING

08:57.070 --> 09:00.472
THAT MY MOVIE GUITAR
WAS NOT PLUGGED INTO ANYTHING.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.842
LIV, THE CONTEST IS TOMORROW.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.443
WE NEED A LEAD GUITARIST.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.079
OKAY, LET'S ALL OF US THINK.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.083
DO ANY OF US KNOW
A LEAD GUITARIST?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.486
(gasps)
I KNOW SOMEONE.

09:14.488 --> 09:17.822
-(cheers)
-(playing tune)

09:26.199 --> 09:29.067
IS IT ME OR DID WE JUST
FIND OUR LEAD GUITARIST?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.903
YOU KNOW WE DID.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HOLDEN?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.306
I'M IN IF YOU'RE IN.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.840
-LIV?
-WHAT?

09:35.842 --> 09:38.043
YES, OH, YES.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.078
I AM SO IN...

09:40.080 --> 09:41.880
TROUBLE.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.419
ARTIE, LET'S TALK BAND NAMES.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.222
I HAVE GOT THE PERFECT NAME
FOR OUR NEW HIP-HOP SOUND--

09:51.224 --> 09:52.791
CHECK IT.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.162
JOE MAMA.

09:57.164 --> 10:01.066
BOO-YA! YOU LOVE IT?
NAW, I CAN TELL YOU LOVE IT.

10:01.068 --> 10:04.069
NAW, I DON'T.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.206
BUT I HAVE A BAND NAME
WHICH WILL FIT PERFECTLY

10:08.208 --> 10:12.544
WITH OUR NEW GLAM ROCK SOUND
AND LOOK-- RED HEAT.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.179
(snaps fingers)

10:17.150 --> 10:20.852
RED HEAT DONS ONE-PIECE
JUMPSUITS WITH STAND-UP COLLARS,

10:20.854 --> 10:24.055
STUDDED LAPELS
AND CAPES WITH MINI-PIANOS.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.926
<i>♪ SPICY AND DICEY</i>
<i>NOT SO NICEY ♪</i>

10:27.928 --> 10:30.528
<i>♪ RED HEAT ♪</i>

10:32.432 --> 10:36.134
WELL, I JUST HATE EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.470
ESPECIALLY THE PART
ABOUT THE MINIONS BEING
UPSTAIRS AT MY HOUSE.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.206
WELL, I HATE EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR FACE.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.807
WELL, I HATE EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR NATURAL--

10:42.809 --> 10:46.077
BOYS, BOYS,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.112
ARTIE'S BEING IMPOSSIBLE.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.081
WELL, JOEY'S BEING POSSIBLE.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.517
WAIT, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF IMPOSSIBLE?

10:52.519 --> 10:54.152
NOPE, IT'S POSSIBLE.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.455
BOYS, SIT DOWN AND WE
ARE GONNA HAVE A CHAT.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.626
ALWAYS REMEMBER THE NUMBER ONE
RULE TO EVERY RELATIONSHIP.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.328
YOU NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.332
I'M SORRY. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
PETE AND I ARE WORKING ON.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.535
-MOM.
-T.M.I., MRS. ROONEY.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.606
YOU OPEN YOUR HEART
AND YOU SAY HOW YOU FEEL.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.474
I FEEL...

11:16.476 --> 11:18.910
CRISPY.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.112
IT'S HOW I FEEL.
PLEASE DON'T NEGATE IT.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.315
JOEY, NOW I FEEL...

11:24.317 --> 11:25.383
KITTY.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.153
WE HAVE A BAND NAME.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.921
Both:
CRISPY KITTY!

11:31.358 --> 11:33.558
SEE? ALREADY AGREEING
ON SOMETHING.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.326
YEAH, MOM, NOW THAT WE
HAVE A THERAPIST.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.162
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN HAVE
A THERAPIST ALL THE TIME.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.431
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.
OF COURSE I'LL JOIN YOUR BAND.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.266
(playing tune)

11:49.309 --> 11:51.643
SHE'S MAGNIFICENT.

11:51.645 --> 11:54.879
I'D LOVE TO ARGUE
WITH YOU, BUT I CAN'T.

12:00.187 --> 12:05.056
(imitating Nimbus)
HELLO, STEVENS POINT.

12:05.058 --> 12:09.060
WE'RE LIVE IN THE ROONEY
KITCHEN WITH KAREN ROONEY.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.664
(laughs)
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

12:12.666 --> 12:15.233
I'M PERFECTING
THE NIMBUS FLAIR.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.069
I DID A SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS
OF JOHNNY'S ON-AIR VOICE.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.239
THIS DEVICE REGISTERS
MY VOICE AS I SPEAK.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.976
SEE, TO ANNOUNCE LIKE NIMBUS,
YOU GOTTA HIT THE RED,

12:24.978 --> 12:27.979
THEN BRING IT ON DOWN
TO ORANGE, THEN UP
TO RED AGAIN,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.648
AND THEN WAY ON DOWN
TO GREEN.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.487
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT GOES ON
IN THAT LITTLE HEAD
OF YOURS,

12:35.489 --> 12:38.123
BUT I AM HONORED TO WITNESS
WHAT COMES OUT.

12:38.125 --> 12:42.393
SO WHAT'S ON THE MENU
TONIGHT, MRS. ROONEY?

12:42.395 --> 12:45.230
WELL, MR. NIMBUS.

12:45.232 --> 12:50.101
YOUR AUDIENCE MIGHT BE
INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT
I AM TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.669
BOOM! ZAP!

12:51.671 --> 12:56.407
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S TAKING
A CULINARY RISK WITH
CHICKEN VINDALOO.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.410
HOW IT'LL GO OVER
IS ANYBODY'S GUESS,

12:59.412 --> 13:03.548
BUT IT'S CURRY IN A HURRY
ON CRANE STREET.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.250
NIMBUS OUT.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.156
(pop music playing)

13:15.162 --> 13:17.996
<i>♪ WE ARE WOUND UP</i>
<i>LIKE A CLOCK ♪</i>

13:17.998 --> 13:21.032

13:26.006 --> 13:28.072
YEPPERS. YEP. YES.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.608
I'M JUST KIND OF HAVING
TROUBLE FOCUSING.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.144
I JUST NEED SOMETHING
TO BLOCK OUT ALL
MY DISTRACTIONS.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.114
YOU KNOW, LIKE, SUNGLASSES,

13:36.116 --> 13:38.016
OR, LIKE, A BLINDFOLD

13:38.018 --> 13:39.450
OR BLACKOUT CURTAINS

13:39.452 --> 13:42.187
TO BLOCK THE SUN THAT SHINES
IN HOLDEN'S EYES.

13:43.156 --> 13:47.125
ALL RIGHT, THIS SHOULD DO IT.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.228
THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS
IS TONIGHT.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.497
JUST GO WITH IT.
TWO, THREE, FOUR!

13:54.367 --> 13:57.068

14:26.566 --> 14:31.302
I'M GIVING A CONCERT
TO MR. CUDDLES AND HIS
MERRY BAND OF FRIENDS.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.440
I LOVE YOU, STUFFED ANIMALS!

14:36.643 --> 14:39.510
LIV, YOU DO KNOW THAT
THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS
IS, LIKE, ABOUT TO START.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.745
WHY AREN'T YOU THERE
RIGHT NOW?

14:40.747 --> 14:44.249
OH, I'M NOT GOING.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.484
WHAT? WHY?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.187
BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T BE
IN THAT BAND WITH HOLDEN.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.091
OKAY, BUT, LIV,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU SHOULD JUST QUIT.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.360
OKAY, EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY, MADS.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.429
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER HAD
FEELINGS FOR A GUY THAT
YOU JUST CAN'T BE WITH?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.769
I'M JUST GONNA STAND HERE
UNTIL IT HITS YOU.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.238
OKAY.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.209
OH, DIGGIE.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.712
DIGGIE. YES, THANK YOU.

15:14.714 --> 15:19.617
AND, LIV, WHEN YOU JOINED THAT
BAND, IT WAS SORT OF LIKE
YOU JOINED A TEAM.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.720
YOU KNOW, AND IT IS
CRUNCH TIME,

15:22.722 --> 15:25.123
AND YOU CANNOT LET
YOURSELF GET DISTRACTED
RIGHT NOW.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.660
DO YOU THINK I LET MYSELF
GET DISTRACTED
WHEN I'M PLAYING IN A GAME,

15:28.662 --> 15:30.261
AND MY EX-BOYFRIEND'S
IN THE STANDS,

15:30.263 --> 15:33.097
AND SWEAT IS STINGING MY EYES,
AND MOM'S SCREAMING,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.233
"SHE CAME OUT OF MY WOMB
WITH A BASKETBALL"?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.870
YEAH, MOM DOES DO THAT
A LOT, DOESN'T SHE?

15:38.872 --> 15:40.672
LITERALLY EVERY TIME I SCORE.

15:42.208 --> 15:46.611
BUT THE POINT IS, LIV,
YOUR TEAM NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW,

15:46.613 --> 15:49.247
AND YOU CAN'T LET THEM DOWN JUST
'CAUSE THINGS GET HARD FOR YOU.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.782
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.717
I'M GONNA GO JOIN MY TEAM.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.620
-THEN WHAT?
-WE'RE GONNA WIN THE BATTLE.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.689
-GO, GO, GO!
-YEAH!

16:05.198 --> 16:07.165
HELLO--

16:07.167 --> 16:09.233
STEVENS POINT,

16:09.235 --> 16:12.236
AND WELCOME
TO THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.773
HOLY MOTHER OF MARCIA,
DO WE HAVE A LINEUP FOR YOU.

16:15.775 --> 16:20.578
AND I DON'T MEAN THE ONE JOHNNY
WAS IN AFTER BORROWING HIS
EX-WIFE'S CAR.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.148
DID I GO THERE?
YES, I DID.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.452
NOW LET'S KICK OFF THE BATTLE

16:27.454 --> 16:28.820
WITH A WARM WELCOME

16:28.822 --> 16:33.291
FOR CRISPY KITTY.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.395
MONKEY SEE,
MONKEY KILLED IT.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.368
OKAY, NOW, GUYS, REMEMBER.
THIS IS NOT ARTIE'S BAND.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.771
THIS IS NOT JOEY'S BAND,
THIS IS CRISPY KITTY.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.639
I'M FEELING...

16:48.641 --> 16:50.408
-Both: READY TO ROCK!
-WHOO!

16:54.214 --> 16:57.682
WE CALL THIS ONE
<i>ARTEMIS PRIME.</i>

16:57.684 --> 17:00.918
WHAT? NO, DUDE, THE SONG IS
CALLED  <i> KITTY KITTY TIME.</i>

17:00.920 --> 17:03.888
IT WAS.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.523
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.594

17:09.596 --> 17:12.730

17:12.732 --> 17:15.700
<i>♪ OH, HE'S SO FINE ♪</i>

17:16.736 --> 17:19.971

17:19.973 --> 17:21.606
<i>♪ WHOO! ♪</i>

17:22.675 --> 17:25.243
WHAT? A GIANT PICTURE
OF YOUR FACE.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.644
ARTIE, I NEVER AGREED TO THIS.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.980
WELL, I NEVER AGREED
TO CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINION.

17:28.982 --> 17:31.816
BOYS, BOYS,
I'M FEELING...

17:31.818 --> 17:34.419
I'M FEELING LIKE
CRISPY KITTY'S COOKED!

17:36.222 --> 17:37.688
MINIONS, HO!

17:42.529 --> 17:44.328
ALLOW ME TO TAKE YOU AWAY.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.633
(playing upbeat tune)

17:55.942 --> 17:57.642
DEAD AIR, JOHNNY.
WE NEED FILLER.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.013
OKAY, MONKEY, TIME FOR YOU
TO EARN YOUR MONKEY CHOW.

18:02.015 --> 18:06.517
GET UP THERE, FILL TIME
AND ENGAGE THE CROWD UNTIL
THE NEXT BAND CAN START.

18:06.519 --> 18:10.254
WHAT? BUT I ONLY MEMORIZED
THE INTRODUCTIONS TO EACH BAND.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.356
I WASN'T PREPARED
TO SHOOT FROM THE HIP.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.529
MONKEY CAN'T, MONKEY FAIL.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.466
HEY, PEOPLE.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.904
-IN THE CROWD.
-(booing)

18:26.906 --> 18:28.473
THE KID'S CRASHING
AND BURNING.

18:28.475 --> 18:33.044
YEP, GOTTA GO MAKE THE SAVE.
GUS T. WIND DID IT FOR ME.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.645
NOW TIME TO PAY IT FORWARD.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.349
GOTTA SHARE THE NIMBUS FLAIR.

18:39.552 --> 18:44.455
RED, ORANGE, GREEN.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.290
CHICKEN VINDALOO.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.060
I AGREE
WITH MINI NIMBY HERE.

18:49.062 --> 18:52.730
I THINK CHICKEN VINDALOO
WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER
NAME THAN CRISPY KITTY.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.600
I MEAN, WHO NAMES
THEIR BAND THAT ANYWAY?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.935
MY MUNCH OF A BROTHER,
THAT'S WHO, JOHNNY.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.739
(laughs)
VERY FUNNY.
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.509
YEAH, LET'S HOPE THERE'S ONLY
ONE MUNCH IN THE ROONEY BUNCH,

19:04.511 --> 19:08.779
BECAUSE YOUR SISTER LIV'S
COMING UP HERE WITH HER BAND
THE DREAM IN JUST A FEW,

19:08.781 --> 19:12.917
BUT, FOR NOW, PLEASE WELCOME
TO THE STAGE THE CORNCOB GIRLS.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.686
(cheering)

19:16.890 --> 19:18.956
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.559
HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING,

19:21.561 --> 19:23.394
BUT MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE YOU CARE?

19:23.396 --> 19:27.431
HERE'S MY SECRET, KID.
I'M AS SHALLOW AS
I AM HANDSOME.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.974
WE'RE UP NEXT.
WHERE'S LIV?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.943
YEAH, WHAT DO WE DO IF SHE
DOESN'T SHOW UP IN TIME?

19:38.945 --> 19:42.513
WORST CASE SCENARIO,
I BODY-SLAM YOU BOTH
IN THE RING.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.116
SO AT LEAST PEOPLE GET
THEIR MONEY'S WORTH.

19:46.085 --> 19:49.086
(panting) HEY, TEAM,
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.655
ARE WE READY
TO WIN THIS?

19:50.657 --> 19:51.956
LIV, WHERE WERE YOU?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.357
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.962
YES, YEAH.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.097
IT IS NOW. I PROMISE.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.034
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.103
Nimbus:
NEXT UP, OUR FINAL
PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.040
LET'S WELCOME THE DREAM.

20:09.042 --> 20:13.010
HEY, GUYS, ARE WE READY
TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW
STEVENS POINT HOW IT'S DONE?

20:13.012 --> 20:16.013
-YEAH!
-YEAH, LET'S BATTLE!

20:16.015 --> 20:18.749

STEVENS POINT? HUH?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.167
YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE
OUR WINNER, PARKER?

22:16.169 --> 22:18.536
THIS IS ALL YOU.
YOU'RE THE KING.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.272
AWW, I KNOW.

22:21.274 --> 22:26.010
OKAY, THE JUDGES HAVE
MADE THEIR DECISION
AND IT'S UNANIMOUS.

22:26.012 --> 22:30.047
THE WINNER
OF THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS IS...

22:30.049 --> 22:31.582
THE DREAM!

22:33.152 --> 22:36.554
SHE CAME OUT OF MY WOMB
WITH A MICROPHONE!

22:46.099 --> 22:48.265
(gasps)

22:48.267 --> 22:50.000
YOU'RE STILL WEARING THAT?

22:50.002 --> 22:52.036
MY ZIPPER GOT STUCK.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.606
I'LL BE WEARING IT UNTIL
MY SEAMSTRESS, INGA, GETS
BACK FROM MUNICH.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.810
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE THE ALBUM COVER
THAT WE DESIGNED

22:59.812 --> 23:01.879
BEFORE CRISPY KITTY BROKE UP?

23:05.017 --> 23:07.051
GLORIOUS!

23:07.053 --> 23:10.755
THIS IS TOO GOOD TO WASTE.
WE MUST REUNITE IMMEDIATELY.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.057
I HAD THE EXACT SAME THOUGHT.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.862
WHERE'S OUR FLAUTIST?
WE'RE NOTHING WITHOUT HER.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.133
I'M NOT SURE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET TODAY.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.235
(playing tune)

23:31.577 --> 23:32.810
Joey and Artie:
<i>CRISPY KITTY!</i>
