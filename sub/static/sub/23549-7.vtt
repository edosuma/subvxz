WEBVTT

00:18.520 --> 00:19.840
They're gaining!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.440
Because you are slowing us down.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.480
[Tripitaka] There's cover up ahead!

00:27.760 --> 00:28.880
Wait!

00:38.880 --> 00:40.120
Is this what I think it is?

00:43.480 --> 00:44.760
[Pigsy] Odd time for a meeting.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.760
Why don't they follow?

00:47.520 --> 00:48.800
They look scared.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
Of what?

00:51.560 --> 00:55.280
Well, the Kin won't let them leave.
They'll be dead by nightfall.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.280
And when it is revealed
we lost the only human

00:58.360 --> 01:01.800
who knows the ancient language,
we will be next.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.240
[Raxion] Turn back, and we fail.
Keep going, and we die.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.600
Any other options?

01:10.680 --> 01:12.520
You will speak to the Kin.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.880
Alone.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.760
They'll kill me
the second that they lay eyes on me.

01:16.840 --> 01:22.320
Calm yourself, Raxion.
They've already seen us.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.040
Come on, let's go.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.360
[chittering]

02:21.560 --> 02:22.720
[spider Kin] What do you want?

02:24.320 --> 02:26.120
I'm here to make you an offer.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.520
-Hmm?
-Don't look.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.280
Three of our prisoners have escaped.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.960
I need... My employer
needs you to catch them.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.360
Catching gods is expensive.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.520
That's the going rate.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.800
If they're in our home,
they're already dead.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.920
Well, you can kill the gods,
but I want the monk.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.960
[Kin] If you take the human,
what will we eat?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.800
There's enough there
to buy yourself something, hmm?

03:01.160 --> 03:03.960
One more thing. I'm coming with ya.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.240
-[spider Kin] You don't trust us?
-[earth Kin chittering]

03:09.320 --> 03:10.360
No.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.520
[Pigsy] So, let me get this clear.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.160
You wanted a crown, and that led
to the world being plunged into darkness?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.680
I was betrayed.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.200
Really, Monkey? That's your take away?

03:20.280 --> 03:22.040
-That you were betrayed?
-More or less.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.080
[sighs] And I thought
I lacked perspective.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.200
He who caused the problem
has now been charged with rectifying it.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.240
That is very fitting.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.000
My favorite bit is
the same crown you tried to steal

03:32.080 --> 03:33.440
is now stuck on your head
for all eternity.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.640
Anything else
you want to pontificate over?

03:37.720 --> 03:41.120
Or shall we continue with trying
not to get ourselves killed?

03:56.520 --> 03:57.800
[growls]

04:02.440 --> 04:03.360
[gasps]

04:05.840 --> 04:07.000
Where's Tripitaka?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.120
Could be relieving himself
behind the trees.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.480
Very shy, that monk.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.279
He went in here.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.320
It's probably a trap.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.200
How else are we going to find him?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.000
[grunts]

04:40.160 --> 04:41.160
-[coughs]
-[grunts]

04:46.440 --> 04:48.720
Who are you? What do you want?

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
[chittering]

05:01.160 --> 05:03.840
[screaming]

05:24.640 --> 05:26.080
Looking for the monastery?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.720
It was razed two centuries ago.
The monks were all eaten.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.920
And your name is?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
[Monkey] Tripitaka!

05:37.720 --> 05:38.600
I know you.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.640
Monkey.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.680
I've waited to see you for so long.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.480
I wondered whether my mind
was playing tricks on me.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.760
Who's the moss lady?

05:49.840 --> 05:52.160
I don't know, but she saved my life.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.520
And you must be Tripitaka.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.600
Wait, I've seen you before.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.800
At Monkey's trial.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.840
She's one of the gods who put me away.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.680
I was wrong. We all were.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.520
And I've spent the last 500 years
trying to right that wrong.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.800
I should have believed you.
Will you forgive me?

06:17.240 --> 06:18.520
[sighs]

06:18.600 --> 06:22.840
I suppose, in comparison to the rest
of them, I hate you the least.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.080
[Kin snarling]

06:25.000 --> 06:25.960
What is that?

06:26.040 --> 06:28.440
We must hurry.
I will lead you out of the forest.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
Wait, wait. Why should we trust you?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.240
[snarling continues]

06:33.880 --> 06:35.400
I do. Lead the way.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.480
[sighs] We know where they are.
What are we waiting for?

06:50.320 --> 06:52.520
[spider Kin] One of our blood has fallen.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.760
So we catch the monk, and then you can
find a new friend to join your tribe.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.480
-[grunts]
-What?

06:58.560 --> 07:03.120
Be careful. We have a low tolerance
for middle management.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.160
Huh.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.920
Hey, where are you going?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.160
Supplies. Good thinking.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.200
We can launch a counterattack.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.840
I don't think these belong to her.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.920
[flies buzzing]

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
[gasps]

07:30.800 --> 07:32.040
What is this place?

07:32.760 --> 07:34.440
Where you would have ended up.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.000
The demons tracking you
are the Forest Kin,

07:38.080 --> 07:40.600
former bodyguards
of the White Bone Demon Queen.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.160
The Kin stole a sacred treasure
from their former mistress.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.440
And in return,
she cast a spell that stole their faces.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.080
Sounds fair.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.360
That's not the worst part.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.200
She gave each of them new ones.

07:53.760 --> 07:58.960
Some say they possess the face of animals,
others say insects or rodents.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.240
The truth is,

08:01.160 --> 08:04.480
no one has never seen the true face
of a Kin and lived to tell the tale.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.000
They exiled themselves from the world
and have lived in this forest ever since.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.920
Long enough to develop a taste
for things other than fruit.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.760
Bark? Vines?

08:19.560 --> 08:20.560
People.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.640
What if they come back?

08:22.720 --> 08:24.760
They're coming back, aren't they?
We have to go.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.400
[Gwen] He's right. We must keep moving.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.040
The Kin draw their strength
from this forest,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.160
but where the forest ends,
so do their powers.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.640
They won't track us beyond it.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.679
We've a long way to go. Keep up.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.640
[Pigsy] Why would that demon
want to take Tripitaka?

08:45.720 --> 08:46.880
Didn't even look twice at us.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.360
[Monkey] It's the oldest rule
of the predator.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.520
Pick off the injured and weak first.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.680
Maybe they were
going to use Tripitaka to lure me.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.640
Not everything is about you, Monkey.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.560
After what we heard today, I wonder.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.160
Eyes open, monk.
I might not be able to save you next time.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.720
Who says I need you to save me?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.560
[whooshing]

09:07.960 --> 09:09.040
There are more coming.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.600
[throwing star whooshing]

09:15.880 --> 09:17.200
It's in the trees.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.280
Show yourself!

09:20.840 --> 09:21.760
Has that ever worked?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.080
I'd say that was very effective,
wouldn't you?

09:30.280 --> 09:31.320
What are they doing?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.520
[groaning]

09:47.240 --> 09:48.640
[grunts]

09:52.600 --> 09:54.840
Watch out! They're dividing you.
Stick together!

09:55.680 --> 09:57.640
[grunts] A little help, please!

10:07.360 --> 10:09.120
[both grunting]

10:18.280 --> 10:20.680
Why did they disappear?
They had us right where they wanted us.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.800
It's no accident. They had a plan.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.360
Quickly.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.400
[sniffs] This was your plan?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.760
I said no poison.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.120
[spider Kin] Seems the monk
has had an accident,

10:51.200 --> 10:54.320
but he can be cured for twice the price.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.560
Do you know whose silver it is
that you're stealing?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.040
Oi, you look at me
when I'm talking to you!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.280
[spider Kin chitters]

11:02.360 --> 11:05.400
[gasps] Ah, I mean,

11:05.480 --> 11:09.840
'course... he knows where to find you
if he wants to complain.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.440
[breathing heavily]

11:23.280 --> 11:24.160
[grunts]

11:25.480 --> 11:26.560
Tripitaka!

11:30.320 --> 11:31.880
He's been poisoned.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.400
[breathing heavily]

11:38.480 --> 11:40.920
No. Please, I just need rest.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.240
Stay back! Keep guard. Spread out.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.600
Is he okay?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.760
He needs to rest.
We'll camp here for the night.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.120
I have lived in this forest a long time,
waiting for the Monkey King

12:07.200 --> 12:09.880
who was to be traveling
with a warrior monk.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.000
Now you are no warrior.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.560
I doubt you're are a monk.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.040
So who are you?

12:16.120 --> 12:17.800
I'm Tripitaka.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.600
That name carries the hope of gods
and the future of our world.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.880
Do not take it lightly.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.520
Who are you?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.480
[breathing heavily]

12:46.560 --> 12:48.160
He was shaking like it was winter.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.160
He'll be fine.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.680
Tomorrow we'll be out of the forest,
and we can keep searching for the scrolls.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.920
You think the Resistance
will continue to welcome us

12:56.000 --> 12:59.360
when they find out that Monkey
was responsible for all this?

12:59.440 --> 13:02.080
What makes you think
they don't already know?

13:03.160 --> 13:07.200
It doesn't matter how we got here.
It matters how we fight our way out.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.640
The Resistance know that
better than anyone.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.720
Just like they know
we need Monkey to do it.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.280
How is Tripitaka?

13:17.040 --> 13:18.080
Will he live?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.520
[sighs]

13:30.040 --> 13:31.560
Good news or bad?

13:33.320 --> 13:35.880
What did the scholar tell you
about Tripitaka?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.000
I never knew him.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.080
When I got out, it was just the monk.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.840
No hair. Sad face. Lots of questions.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.200
Western Mountains this and that.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.080
It was this monk who released you?

13:50.440 --> 13:52.560
He's as stubborn as a giant...

13:54.240 --> 13:55.840
but he knows a thing or two.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.480
Enough to get us out
of that nightmare factory back there.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.440
He rescued you from the shaman?

14:02.680 --> 14:03.680
Yes.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.800
[sighs]

14:12.880 --> 14:15.040
Child, where did you come from?

14:16.200 --> 14:20.560
I was raised by the scholar.
He's the one who kept the crown.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.720
I knew him.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.120
When he died...

14:27.480 --> 14:31.160
[sighs] it was like the world ended.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.080
I had to became Tripitaka.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.000
I had to release Monkey.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.240
I didn't mean to lie.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.680
I just couldn't find anything else to do.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.360
[Gwen] Shh, now.

14:51.440 --> 14:56.520
You have done more than you know.
And we will never forget it.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.440
[sniffles]

15:02.040 --> 15:04.440
-Breathe.
-[breath trembling]

15:19.080 --> 15:20.360
[exhales heavily]

15:25.200 --> 15:29.040
Needs plenty of rest, but should be
as stubborn as usual by the morning.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.480
Looks like he's not the only one.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.320
You sleep. I can stay and keep watch.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.880
When I first came out of the rock,
I didn't know what to expect.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.040
I thought perhaps a little more fanfare.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.840
But there was nothing.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.640
No gods, no welcoming ceremony... nothing.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.800
Just you.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.480
An insignificant human.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.800
No, that... [sighs]

16:19.880 --> 16:22.040
That's not what I meant, okay?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.080
This isn't coming out right.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.680
When my master died,

16:27.560 --> 16:31.680
I thought I would never again
have the chance

16:31.760 --> 16:33.440
to be a part of something that mattered.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.200
Until I met you.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.520
Don't die.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.920
-Monkey.
-Yes?

16:53.160 --> 16:55.600
[birds chirping]

17:11.319 --> 17:12.839
You decided to join us again.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.240
[grunts] Don't do that again. Ever!

17:16.319 --> 17:18.359
[chuckles] I'll try.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.200
I'm really happy that you're
feeling better, Tripitaka.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.160
Sleep well?

17:29.760 --> 17:30.840
-Yep.
-Yeah...

17:30.920 --> 17:37.160
I heard that fevers cause strange dreams
and... voices. That sort of thing.

17:37.240 --> 17:42.280
I just remember feeling dizzy,
then Gwen looking after me...

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
Then nothing.

17:44.880 --> 17:49.280
Good. Well then, uh, keep up, little monk.
The demons haven't forgotten we're here.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.160
Eat up, Tripitaka.
You need to keep your strength up.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
Thank you.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.920
I don't know how you managed
to make it this far,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.440
but I do know this.

18:01.240 --> 18:05.320
The one who takes the journey west
cannot be the girl in this letter.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
Or you will only put lives at risk.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.920
[Gwen] We're nearing
the edge of the forest.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.960
So, why are we stopping?

18:30.120 --> 18:32.120
[Kin snarling]

18:38.720 --> 18:40.320
Tripitaka, come with me.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.200
[chittering]

19:03.360 --> 19:05.000
[resounding echo]

19:12.680 --> 19:13.840
[throwing star whooshing]

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
[grunts]

19:30.080 --> 19:32.400
-[throwing star whooshing]
-[grunts]

19:40.640 --> 19:43.200
-[sniffing]
-[snarling]

19:43.840 --> 19:46.400
[both grunting]

20:03.960 --> 20:04.920
[gasps]

20:07.440 --> 20:09.040
[groans]

20:13.840 --> 20:15.400
Oh... Hello.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.240
[exclaims]

20:18.480 --> 20:19.920
[screams]

20:32.840 --> 20:34.680
[grunting]

20:37.000 --> 20:38.960
[pants and groans]

20:41.160 --> 20:43.480
-[grunts]
-What's wrong?

20:43.560 --> 20:45.560
[breathing heavily]

20:50.400 --> 20:53.280
The poison. You took it from me.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.560
-There's nothing to be done about it now.
-But why?

20:56.640 --> 20:58.680
Why would you sacrifice yourself for me?

20:59.520 --> 21:01.080
-Get down.
-What?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.040
Get down!

21:03.360 --> 21:04.200
[grunts]

21:08.680 --> 21:09.840
Monkey!

21:11.080 --> 21:12.080
[snarls]

21:13.160 --> 21:14.560
[grunting]

21:17.440 --> 21:18.400
[groans]

21:24.480 --> 21:27.920
Just make this easy on all of us, hmm?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.040
-[muffled screaming]
-[grunting]

21:36.400 --> 21:39.240
[both straining]

21:39.960 --> 21:41.480
[Raxion screaming]

21:49.280 --> 21:50.360
Gwen!

21:56.120 --> 21:59.360
Monkey, you must keep Tripitaka safe...

22:00.400 --> 22:01.840
whatever the cost.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.320
Please. We can't just leave her here.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.200
Oh... I won't be here for long.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.560
My journey is done.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.840
Yours is still ahead of you.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.560
There is no shame in being who you are.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.680
Don't deny your true self.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.760
[gasping]

22:26.320 --> 22:27.320
[exhales]

22:27.400 --> 22:28.880
[Tripitaka] Gwen.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.320
Her spirit is gone, Tripitaka.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.000
She died for me.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.320
[breathing heavily]

23:10.640 --> 23:13.000
[Tripitaka's mother] I have walked
from the North Water...

23:14.840 --> 23:16.680
[theme music playing]
