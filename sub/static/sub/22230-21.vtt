WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.309
THE INTERNET AND IS INTENDED FOR

00:10.311 --> 00:11.677
A MATURE AUDIENCE.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.612
COMEDY CENTRAL DOES NOT CONDONE

00:13.614 --> 00:14.713
THE ACTIVITIES PERFORMED AND

00:14.715 --> 00:15.714
DISCOURAGES ANYONE FROM

00:15.716 --> 00:16.915
ATTEMPTING THEM.

00:16.917 --> 00:27.726
ENJOY.

00:27.728 --> 00:40.773
>> OH, [bleep]!

00:40.775 --> 00:43.075
>> THERE WAS NO DOUBLE LINE.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.476
SO THAT ONE'S ON THE CITY.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.345
WELCOME TO TOSH.0.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.813
TO ALL OUR DRONES FIGHTING

00:47.815 --> 00:49.815
OVERSEAS, COME HOME SAFE.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.150
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BILLBOARD THE

00:51.152 --> 00:51.850
SHOW.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.851
TONIGHT...

00:52.853 --> 00:54.086
I GET SWOLL WITH THESE BOYS...

00:54.088 --> 00:55.254
I VOW TO KEEP PLAYING "IS IT

00:55.256 --> 00:56.989
RACIST?" UNTIL RACISM

00:56.991 --> 00:58.257
IS ERADICATED FROM THIS WORLD

00:58.259 --> 00:59.958
FOREVER...

00:59.960 --> 01:01.427
AND, INSTEAD OF JUST MARCHING

01:01.429 --> 01:02.895
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE,

01:02.897 --> 01:04.830
MY FANS ACTUALLY CAUSE IT.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.633
OKAY, HIS FIRST MISTAKE WAS

01:07.635 --> 01:09.034
OVERCORRECTING ON THAT SLIDE.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.436
HIS SECOND MISTAKE WAS BEING AN

01:10.438 --> 01:14.773
ADULT ON A BIG WHEEL.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.475
NOW HE'LL BE DRIFTING IN AND OUT

01:16.477 --> 01:21.380
OF A COMA FOR A FEW WEEKS.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.282
HIS IMMATURE LIFE JUST FLASHED

01:23.284 --> 01:25.651
BEFORE HIS EYES.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.019
I ALSO GOT IN A BIG WHEEL

01:27.021 --> 01:28.454
ACCIDENT THIS WEEK,

01:28.456 --> 01:32.024
OVER THERE ON RAINBOW ROAD.

01:32.026 --> 01:39.965
>> HERE WE GO!

01:39.967 --> 01:41.333
pop!

01:41.335 --> 01:42.701
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DAMAGE.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.936
MY BROTHER OWNS A BODY SHOP.

01:43.938 --> 01:44.903
HE GONNA FIX IT.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.405
OH!

01:46.407 --> 01:50.676
TONY STEWART, YOU KILLED MARIO!

01:50.678 --> 01:52.911
TONY STEWART DIDN'T KILL ME.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.580
IT JUST TURNED ME

01:54.582 --> 01:56.748
INTO SMALL MARIO.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.550
ALL RIGHT, THIS NEXT HEIST MUST

01:58.552 --> 02:01.286
HAVE TAKEN MINUTES TO PLAN.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.989
DOOT-DA-DO.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.725
JUST BROWSING THE ART UNAWARE OF

02:06.727 --> 02:21.473
SECURITY CAMERAS IN 2014.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.975
GUESS HE OVERESTIMATED THE SIZE

02:22.977 --> 02:25.144
OF HIS HOODIE.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.478
AMERICAN APPAREL DOES RUN PRETTY

02:26.480 --> 02:27.779
SMALL.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.648
NO, NO NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:29.650 --> 02:30.883
CUT IT OUT OF THE FRAME,

02:30.885 --> 02:32.651
ROLL IT UP, THEN HANG A DECOY

02:32.653 --> 02:34.086
PIECE TO OFFSET THE WEIGHTED

02:34.088 --> 02:35.687
SENSORS!

02:35.689 --> 02:37.356
YOU'D THINK A GUY SMART ENOUGH

02:37.358 --> 02:38.357
TO GET PAST THE INVISIBLE

02:38.359 --> 02:40.792
LASERS WOULD KNOW THIS.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.029
JUST LIKE HE DREW IT UP.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.932
NOW OFF TO [bleep] RENE RUSSO.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.867
OKAY, TIME TO OUT SOME GUY IN

02:48.869 --> 02:54.206
MISSISSIPPI.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.141
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FRAME EVERY

02:56.143 --> 02:58.877
SINGLE PICTURE YOU TAKE.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.612
MUST'VE HAD A SALE OVER THERE AT

03:00.614 --> 03:03.081
AARON BROTHERS.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.449
WHO HANGS PICTURES ON THEIR

03:04.451 --> 03:06.552
DOOR?

03:06.554 --> 03:07.719
THERE'S A FRAMED PHOTO OF

03:07.721 --> 03:09.054
EVERYONE IN HIS LIFE

03:09.056 --> 03:11.056
HE'S EMBARRASSING RIGHT NOW.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.758
DID YOU SEE THAT, NOT ONE FAT

03:12.760 --> 03:15.060
JOKE ABOUT THAT FAT ASS!

03:15.062 --> 03:16.962
YOU KNOW WHY?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.564
BECAUSE THAT GUY KEPT DANCING,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.098
LOST OVER 200 POUNDS, MOVED TO

03:20.100 --> 03:22.234
HOLLYWOOD TO HOST HIS OWN SHOW.

03:22.236 --> 03:41.153
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT WAS ME.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.188
IF ANYBODY OUT THERE'S A 9 XL,

03:43.190 --> 03:44.823
SEND ME A SELF-ADDRESSED STAMPED

03:44.825 --> 03:46.124
ENVELOPE, AND I'LL MAIL YOU

03:46.126 --> 03:47.292
MY THONG.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.794
IT HAS NOT BEEN WASHED.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.262
NOW, THESE THINGS WILL HAPPEN

03:50.264 --> 03:52.164
WHEN YOU DON'T YELL "TIMBER."

03:52.166 --> 03:57.536
[men speaking foreign language]

03:57.538 --> 04:00.305
CATCH THE LOG, DAMN IT!

04:00.307 --> 04:01.773
HE'S ON MY FANTASY RUSSIAN

04:01.775 --> 04:06.378
LOG-CATCHING TEAM.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.846
THEY DON'T HAVE AMBIEN OVER

04:07.848 --> 04:12.017
THERE.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.385
WAS HE TRYING TO CATCH IT WITH

04:13.387 --> 04:14.786
HIS MOUTH?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.755
IT'S NOT A GRAPE.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.223
SERIOUSLY, UKRAINE, YOU CAN'T

04:18.225 --> 04:20.192
STOP THESE GUYS?

04:20.194 --> 04:21.927
MOVING ON.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.128
NO ONE LIKES TO WAIT IN LINE FOR

04:23.130 --> 04:24.196
A SLICE OF PIZZA.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.464
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS

04:25.466 --> 04:26.798
CARRY PEPPER SPRAY.

04:26.800 --> 04:32.037
[all shouting indistinctly]

04:32.039 --> 04:33.372
JUST BE THANKFUL IT'S NOT SEAN

04:33.374 --> 04:34.806
JOHN COLOGNE.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.742
THAT STUFF IS REALLY PUNGENT.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.243
>> SHE GOT MACED.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.380
[all shouting indistinctly]

04:41.382 --> 04:42.881
>> OKAY, I'M PRETTY SURE YOU

04:42.883 --> 04:44.082
DON'T HAVE TO SHAKE IT THAT

04:44.084 --> 04:45.150
MUCH, IT'S NOT VINAIGRETTE,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.419
DIP[bleep].

04:47.421 --> 04:49.121
MAYBE HE WANTS TO PUNISH THEM

04:49.123 --> 04:50.255
FOR EATING EMPTY CARBS

04:50.257 --> 04:52.658
AFTER 10:00 P.M.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.092
GOOD LUCK GETTING THOSE CHEAP

04:54.094 --> 04:55.527
GLUTTONOUS [bleep] OVER AT

04:55.529 --> 04:57.796
CICI'S TO BUDGE.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.333
[coughing]

05:01.335 --> 05:02.301
>> PAID $4.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.502
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE

05:03.504 --> 05:04.436
THAN TEAR GAS TO GET ME

05:04.438 --> 05:05.570
OUT OF HERE.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.938
>> WHERE'S THE MAC AND CHEESE

05:06.940 --> 05:07.939
PIZZA?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.541
>> I HATE OLIVES.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.742
>> JUST A LITTLE GOOD-NATURED

05:10.744 --> 05:12.044
RIBBING, CICI'S, WE KNOW YOU

05:12.046 --> 05:13.478
GUYS SERVE THE MOST AUTHENTIC

05:13.480 --> 05:16.281
ITALIAN CUISINE IN THE U.S.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.783
ALL RIGHT, NOW WHAT?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.618
[horn honking]

05:19.620 --> 05:21.119
[brakes squeak]

05:21.121 --> 05:22.087
>> AMIGO.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.255

05:23.257 --> 05:24.523
AMIGO.

JESUS CHRIST.

05:27.561 --> 05:32.130
[laughs]

05:32.132 --> 05:34.333
>> OOH, I'M GUESSING HE DOESN'T

05:34.335 --> 05:35.534
WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME

05:35.536 --> 05:36.635
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A LOCAL

05:36.637 --> 05:37.869
EATERY.

05:37.871 --> 05:38.837
NOW LET'S SEE WHY EVERY

05:38.839 --> 05:39.871
TRAVEL GUIDE SHOULD JUST SAY

05:39.873 --> 05:41.139
"STAY AT HOME" IN THIS WEEK'S

05:41.141 --> 05:44.676
BREAKDOWN.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.445
I CAN SEE WHY YOU SHELLED OUT

05:46.447 --> 05:47.512
THE MONEY FOR A TRIP TO

05:47.514 --> 05:49.581
THIS BREATHTAKING PLACE.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.816
NOTHING SAYS "SAFE AND SECURE"

05:50.818 --> 05:52.217
MORE THAN EVERY SINGLE

05:52.219 --> 05:53.585
WINDOW BEING BOARDED UP LIKE

05:53.587 --> 05:54.986
THEY'RE EXPECTING A CATEGORY 5

05:54.988 --> 05:56.788
HURRICANE.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.557
SHOCKING THAT THE TOURIST ON A

05:58.559 --> 05:59.758
MINT GREEN RENTAL BIKE WITH A

05:59.760 --> 06:00.992
GOPRO TAPED TO HIS HEAD DIDN'T

06:00.994 --> 06:03.929
BLEND IN.

I'VE SEEN VICE.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.777
>> [speaking foreign language]

06:18.779 --> 06:19.544
>> WHAT IS HE ASKING FOR?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.848
HORCHATA?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.716
POINTING A GUN AT SOMEONE IS THE

06:24.718 --> 06:26.518
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE FOR "GIVE ME

06:26.520 --> 06:29.221
ALL YOUR [bleep] OR DIE."

06:33.894 --> 06:34.793
JUST TO MAKE HIM STOP SAYING

06:34.795 --> 06:35.927
"AMIGO."

06:35.929 --> 06:36.962
DID YOU EVEN OPEN YOUR COPY

06:36.964 --> 06:38.897
OF ROSETTA STONE?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.032
"MOCHILA" MEANS "BACKPACK."

06:41.034 --> 06:42.501
ATTENTION, THIEVES ABROAD.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.635
WE ARE FAR TOO LAZY

06:43.637 --> 06:44.903
TO LEARN YOUR DUMB LANGUAGES.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.705
EITHER SPEAK AMERICAN OR

06:46.707 --> 06:48.206
BRUSH UP ON YOUR CHARADES.

06:48.208 --> 06:52.110
TAKE THE SHOT.

06:52.112 --> 06:52.911
THAT STUPID GRINGO IS GETTING

06:52.913 --> 06:54.546
AWAY.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.714
SORRY, I GOT CONFUSED WHO TO

06:55.716 --> 06:57.416
ROOT FOR.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.984
LOOK AT HIS SCARF.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.051
THIS GUY MUST HAVE JUST

07:00.053 --> 07:01.586
ROBBED SOMEONE EXTREMELY

07:01.588 --> 07:03.255
FASHIONABLE.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.256
"I'M RUNNING FOR MY LIFE.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.323
BUT FIRST,

07:05.325 --> 07:08.794
LET ME TAKE A SELFIE."

07:08.796 --> 07:10.796
OH, GREAT, YOU FINALLY FOUND A

07:10.798 --> 07:12.431
CORRUPT CROSSING GUARD.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.865
UNLESS HE HALTS TRAFFIC ALL THE

07:13.867 --> 07:15.033
WAY BACK TO THE STATES,

07:15.035 --> 07:16.601
YOU NEED TO KEEP RUNNING.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.571
BUT WHAT WAS IN THE BACKPACK?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.473
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.908
COULD BE MORE TO THIS STORY.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.242
IN THE MEANTIME, OBAMA,

07:24.244 --> 07:25.744
MARK THIS GODFORSAKEN

07:25.746 --> 07:27.078
VILLAGE FOR AN AIR STRIKE, AND

07:27.080 --> 07:28.713
FOR THAT, WE THANK YOU.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.148
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, BUT

07:30.150 --> 07:31.016
FIRST...YOU FELL OVER,

07:31.018 --> 07:33.852
YOU FELL OVER.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.688
>> KEEP SUCKING, TEAMS.

OH, NO!

07:50.938 --> 07:56.775
OH, NO!

07:56.777 --> 07:58.977
YOU FELL OVER!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.111
YOU FELL OVER!

08:00.113 --> 08:03.448
YOU FELL OVER!

08:06.819 --> 08:09.821
[laughter]

08:09.823 --> 08:10.922
>> I THINK I'M DYING.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.960
>> CRAIG.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.430
YEAH, WAY TO GO.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.698
>> THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN

08:19.700 --> 08:21.032
LIFTING WITH YOUR BACK

08:21.034 --> 08:22.901
IS SPOTTING WITH YOUR KNEES.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.302
DO YOU REALLY NEED A SPOTTER?

08:24.304 --> 08:25.303
YOU CAN EITHER BENCH IT,

08:25.305 --> 08:26.571
OR YOU CAN'T.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.973
I PREFER NOT TO HAVE SOMEONE

08:27.975 --> 08:29.541
TEABAGGING ME, GETTING ME ALL

08:29.543 --> 08:31.409
HORNY WHILE I LIFT, BRO.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.977
THAT WAS ZACK AND CRAIG, AND

08:32.980 --> 08:34.479
WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL

08:34.481 --> 08:36.147
WEIGHTLIFTING FEDERATION

08:36.149 --> 08:37.482
MIGHT NOT HAVE CONSIDERED

08:37.484 --> 08:38.783
THAT A GOOD LIFT, IT LOOKED

08:38.784 --> 08:40.118
PERFECT TO ME.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.453
A SHREDDED BODY IS THE ONLY WAY

08:41.455 --> 08:42.587
TO DISTRACT WOMEN FROM YOUR

08:42.589 --> 08:43.889
SUB PAR PERSONALITY IF YOU

08:43.890 --> 08:46.558
DON'T HAVE MONEY.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.326
PUMPING IRON IS FOR CONVICTED

08:48.328 --> 08:50.095
FELONS OR PRO ATHLETES, WHICH

08:50.097 --> 08:52.297
IS A BIT REDUNDANT THESE DAYS.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.798
I'M HAPPY HAVING THE PHYSIQUE OF

08:53.800 --> 08:55.634
A FERRET.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.235
MY STRATEGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ZERO

08:57.237 --> 08:59.704
WEIGHT AND NO REPS.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.939
I DON'T HAVE THE FRAME FOR

09:00.941 --> 09:02.240
WEIGHTLIFTING.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.441
WHICH IS A POLITE WAY

09:03.443 --> 09:04.943
OF SAYING I'M OVER 5'8".

09:04.945 --> 09:06.611
WHY WOULD I WASTE MY LIFE

09:06.613 --> 09:07.646
REPEATEDLY PICKING

09:07.648 --> 09:08.880
UP HEAVY THINGS AT A GYM?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.148
YOU ONLY NEED TO BE STRONG

09:10.150 --> 09:11.182
ENOUGH TO OPEN A JAR.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.551
EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS

09:12.553 --> 09:13.685
SHOWING OFF.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.619
IF YOU LIKE GETTING STAPH

09:14.621 --> 09:15.854
INFECTIONS AND LOOKING

09:15.856 --> 09:16.955
AT YOURSELF IN A MIRROR SO MUCH,

09:16.957 --> 09:18.023
MOVE INTO A FUNHOUSE.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.324
AND THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR YOU

09:19.326 --> 09:20.525
LADIES.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.526
THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN

09:21.528 --> 09:22.794
JESSICA ALBA AND

09:22.796 --> 09:25.230
JESSICA BIEL.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.631
IF I THINK YOU COULD BEAT ME UP,

09:26.633 --> 09:27.832
I AM NOT LETTING YOU IN MY

09:27.834 --> 09:29.234
HOUSE.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.468
BUT IF ZACH AND CRAIG WANT TO

09:30.470 --> 09:31.570
GET JACKED, I'LL FLY THEM

09:31.572 --> 09:33.071

13:57.137 --> 13:57.802
IN THE BASEMENT, EVERYTHING

13:57.804 --> 13:58.703
GOES.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.571
NO STUPID GYM RULES.

13:59.573 --> 14:00.305
YOU DON'T NEED TO WIPE ANYTHING

14:00.307 --> 14:01.039
DOWN.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.973
I'D LIKE TO SMELL YOU GUYS

14:01.975 --> 14:03.641
WHEN YOU'RE GOING.

14:03.643 --> 14:04.609
REMEMBER, BAD FORM USES

14:04.611 --> 14:05.510
MORE MUSCLES.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.979
THAT IS HORRIBLE FORM.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.480
NOTHING'S SEXIER THAN A MAN

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
WITH A STRONG JAW.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.717
I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.419
SUCK IT UP OR SUCK A [bleep].

14:14.421 --> 14:16.788
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.456
ALL RIGHT, THREE MORE SETS.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.958
THIS ONE WORKS THE NECK BONE,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.025
WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS CONNECTED

14:21.027 --> 14:22.126
TO THE HEAD BONE.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.628
YOU CHILDREN LIKE HEAD?

14:23.630 --> 14:24.863
PUSH IT.

14:24.865 --> 14:28.867
PUSH IT REAL GOOD.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.869
THIS ONE CAME TO ME IN A DREAM.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.303
WHY DO I DREAM ABOUT BOYS?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.905
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.474
MM, GET ENGORGED.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.743
OH, MAN.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.945
THAT IS HOT.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.280
AT A GYM, YOU HAVE TO WAIT

14:42.282 --> 14:43.548
WHEN SOMEONE'S USING

14:43.550 --> 14:44.515
THE EQUIPMENT.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.050
NOT DOWN HERE.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.552
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, YOU READY?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.987
LET THE ELECTRICITY DO THE WORK

14:48.989 --> 14:51.789
FOR YOU.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.524
COME ON, FEEL IT, FEEL IT.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.726
FEEL THE VIBRATION.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.661
>> AH!

14:56.663 --> 14:57.862
>> NOW, AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS

14:57.864 --> 14:58.997
VIEW, HOTTIES, IT'S TIME FOR US

14:58.999 --> 15:00.565
TO BURN IT OUT.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.532
GRAB YOURSELF AN AXE AND

15:01.534 --> 15:02.467
A BLINDFOLD.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.534
THIS IS THE ONE THAT'LL GET

15:03.536 --> 15:04.502
YOU KICKED OUT OF THOSE FANCY

15:04.504 --> 15:05.670
GYMS.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.604
I NEED YOU TO KEEP YOUR FEET

15:06.606 --> 15:07.772
TOGETHER.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.840
THAT'LL IMPROVE AXE SPEED.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.041
I CALL THIS EXERCISE:

15:10.043 --> 15:11.276
HIT THE LOAD-BEARING POST WITH

15:11.278 --> 15:12.844
AN AXE.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.045
OH, OKAY.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.113
YOU WANT TO HOLD ONTO IT

15:15.115 --> 15:16.347
A LITTLE TIGHTER.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.181
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, TAKE A SECOND.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.016
HERE WE GO.

15:18.018 --> 15:18.616
LET ME GET THAT BACK IN YOUR

15:18.618 --> 15:20.051
HAND.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.085
COME BACK THIS WAY.

15:21.087 --> 15:21.986
WATCH YOURSELF, DON'T LEAN INTO

15:21.988 --> 15:22.854
THAT AXE.

15:22.856 --> 15:23.755
THERE WE GO.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.689
OKAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.890
WHOA, DON'T LEAD FORWARD.

15:25.892 --> 15:26.691
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR HEAD.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.625
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE SORES

15:27.627 --> 15:28.593
TOMORROW.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.062
>> [bleep].

15:31.064 --> 15:32.597
>> YOU THINK IT HURTS NOW.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.865
WAIT TILL DAY TWO.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.501
THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE REALLY SORE.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.704
CAREFUL.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.838
GOOD KIDS.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.973
I HOPE WE STAY IN TOUCH.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.308
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, BUT FIRST,

15:43.310 --> 15:44.609
I THINK THE ALIGNMENT'S OFF

15:44.611 --> 15:51.015
ON YOUR RAZOR SCOOTER.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.789
>> LET'S BE HONEST.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.223
PROBABLY THE THING I WOULD DO--

15:59.225 --> 16:00.091
I WOULD LEAVE IT THERE FOR--

16:00.093 --> 16:00.925
WITH A TUB ON TOP OF IT.

16:00.927 --> 16:01.993
I'M NOT PICKING THAT HUGE

16:01.995 --> 16:02.860
THING UP.

16:02.862 --> 16:03.962
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:03.964 --> 16:04.862
>> IT WOULD FIT IN THE PALM

16:04.864 --> 16:05.697
OF YOUR HAND.

16:05.699 --> 16:06.397
I MEAN, THAT IS--

16:06.399 --> 16:07.198
>> NO, IT WOULDN'T, 'CAUSE I'M

16:07.200 --> 16:07.899
NOT PICKING IT UP.

16:07.901 --> 16:08.766
>> I'M SURE AFRICA IS

16:08.768 --> 16:09.867
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, BUT THE WORST

16:09.869 --> 16:11.336
CREATURES COME OUT OF THERE.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.105
I'M JUST SAYING.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.773
>> WHAT'S COMING UP IN SPORTS?

16:15.775 --> 16:18.676
>> AWKWARD.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.244
BUT DID IT CROSS THE LINE INTO

16:20.246 --> 16:21.846
HATE SPEECH?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.448
LET'S FIND OUT IN A SPIRITED

16:23.450 --> 16:24.449
GAME OF...

16:24.451 --> 16:26.684
>> all: IS IT RACIST?

16:26.686 --> 16:29.487
>> SURE, "CREATURES" ISN'T THE

16:29.489 --> 16:31.155
SMARTEST THING TO SAY AFTER

16:31.157 --> 16:32.590
HEARING TRIGGER WORDS LIKE

16:32.592 --> 16:35.960
"AFRICA" AND "DISGUSTING."

16:35.962 --> 16:37.729
BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND AFRICA

16:37.731 --> 16:39.497
ISN'T CRAWLING WITH MILLIONS OF

16:39.499 --> 16:42.233
DANGEROUS MONSTERS:

16:42.235 --> 16:44.969
LIONS, ELEPHANTS, WILDEBEESTS,

16:44.971 --> 16:47.238
CHARLIZE THERON,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.874
GIRAFFES.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.142
KEEP IN MIND WE ONLY SAW

16:51.144 --> 16:52.377
A SHORT CLIP.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.945
LET'S WATCH A LITTLE MORE OF

16:53.947 --> 16:56.080
THAT NEWSCAST AND SEE IF ANY

16:56.082 --> 16:57.548
OF HIS COLLEAGUES HELPED HIM

16:57.550 --> 16:58.783
DIG HIS WAY OUT OF THAT

16:58.785 --> 16:59.917
BLACK HOLE.

16:59.919 --> 17:00.818
>> IT WOULD FIT IN THE PALM

17:00.820 --> 17:01.719
OF YOUR HAND.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.620
I MEAN, THAT--

17:02.622 --> 17:03.454
>> NO, IT WOULDN'T, 'CAUSE I'M

17:03.456 --> 17:04.388
NOT PICKING IT UP.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.356
>> I'M SURE AFRICA IS

17:05.358 --> 17:06.424
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, BUT THE WORST

17:06.425 --> 17:07.858
CREATURES COME OUT OF THERE.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.726
I'M JUST SAYING.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.163
>> [laughs]

17:12.165 --> 17:13.431
>> AH, IT'S QUITE DARK

17:13.433 --> 17:15.599
IN AFRICA RIGHT NOW,

17:15.602 --> 17:16.800
AS LOCAL TIME IS NEARING

17:16.803 --> 17:18.736
9:00 P.M.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.936
DO WE HAVE A--YES, WE DO HAVE

17:19.939 --> 17:22.540
A MAP OF AFRICA.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.840
I WAS UNAWARE THAT EGYPT WAS

17:23.843 --> 17:25.343
A PART OF AFRICA.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.211
ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THEM AS WHITE.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.378
WELL, YOU KNOW, NOT WHITE.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.747
JUST NOT BLACK-BLACK.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.948
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT PLACE

17:30.950 --> 17:31.983
IS NAMED CHAD.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.718
THAT'S A WHITE PERSON'S NAME.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.553
WHY DIDN'T THEY NAME IT CLYDE?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.754
NOW, THAT'S A OLD BLACK MAN'S

17:36.756 --> 17:38.189
NAME.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.424
USED TO BE A SHOE-SHINE.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.325
REAL RELIGIOUS.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.693
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.995
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT

17:43.997 --> 17:45.163
A LOT OF AIDS MOVING IN HERE,

17:45.165 --> 17:47.465
AND WHEN THAT HITS OUR EBOLA

17:47.467 --> 17:48.733
SYSTEM, IT IS GONNA FORM

17:48.735 --> 17:51.169
A SUPER STORM OF EBOL-AIDS.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.905
YES, EBOL-AIDS.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.907
[laughs]

17:55.909 --> 17:57.508
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO TRAFFIC.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.377

18:03.116 --> 18:04.749

18:04.751 --> 18:06.250
SONYA, HOW MANY WRECKS

18:06.252 --> 18:07.652
ARE THERE?

18:07.654 --> 18:10.488
HOW MANY DID YOU CAUSE?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.056
WELL, I THINK THAT ANSWERS

18:12.058 --> 18:13.958
OUR QUESTION.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.526
THAT WHOLE NEWS CREW IS

18:15.528 --> 18:17.495
DEFINITELY RACIST.
