# Oh, Mandy

00:03.480 --> 00:07.000
# Well, you came and you gave
without taking

00:07.000 --> 00:09.960
# But I sent you away

00:09.960 --> 00:12.120
# Oh, Mandy

00:12.120 --> 00:16.640
# Well, you kissed me and stopped me
from shaking

00:16.640 --> 00:19.400
# And I need you today

00:21.680 --> 00:25.000
Lucky heather, dear?
Oh, no, no, thanks.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.280
Get yourself some good luck.
No, I'm all right.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.560
For the pretty lady on a lovely day.
No, I'm OK.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.800
It's only a pound.No, honestly.
Fuck you, then!

00:32.800 --> 00:34.160
You're going to die!

It were dead scary, Lola.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.840
I'm worried she's put
a curse on me or something.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.800
Hey, are you going to stay up
on Friday and watch for the comet?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.640
The what? The comet. An asteroid

01:00.640 --> 01:02.680
It only comes every 76 years.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.320
Oh, who gives a toss?
I never look up, me.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.960
Wouldn't even give it
the satisfaction of craning me neck.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.760
This is the closest to Earth
the comet has ever been.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.080
They say you will be able
to see it with a naked eye.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.640
What the fuck's a naked eye?
Sounds disgusting.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.960
I've been reading all about it.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.160
They say the comet is meant
to be a bad omen.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.320
The last time it came,
we got the Spanish flu.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.680

What is it, Mandy?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.480
I've just got home
and there's a note through the door.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.920
It says, "You know what
I'm here for. The Terminator"

02:29.920 --> 02:31.400
It's from the Terminator!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.920
The Terminator?
Who is the Terminator?

02:33.920 --> 02:36.160
I don't know, but he's not a mobile
hairdresser, is he?

02:36.160 --> 02:37.840
Maybe a hit man or something.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.240
Oh, God, Lola, why didn't I just buy
the heather?

02:40.240 --> 02:41.960
You should always buy the heather,
Mandy!

02:41.960 --> 02:44.000
Just to be on the safe side.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.040
I know. I've been really stupid.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.360
Oh, Lola, can you come over?

02:49.360 --> 02:51.880
I don't think I can face
being here on me own tonight.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.800
No, I don't think I can.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.000
Look, I know I'm late to the party,
but I wanted to binge-watch

02:57.000 --> 02:59.520
King Tiger tonight,
and you don't have Netflix.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.160
But I'm all alone here, Lola.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.120
I'll come and check on you
in the morning.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.840
You need to make a list of people
who might want you dead

03:05.840 --> 03:08.160
and eliminate them one by one.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.600
When you say eliminate,
what do you mean?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.280
Apologise to them.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.880
Oh, right.
I mean, who'd want me dead?

03:16.560 --> 03:20.440
I suppose I told Linda Chaffinch
I didn't like her choppy bob once.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.880
Can't be that, surely.
She can be quite small minded.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.560
Or there was Derek Dribbs.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.400
He asked me out,
but I turned him down.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.920
Nothing personal. He just stank
and had a bit of a wet beard.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.440
And there was Donna Ball.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.000
Let her down in a bank robbery

03:34.000 --> 03:36.160
and now she's doing 15 years
as a result.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.560
What do you think, Lol?

03:52.480 --> 03:55.240
I just wanted to apologise
for the way I turned you down

03:55.240 --> 03:57.360
when you asked me out.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.920
Yeah, I know, I know, it was a long
time ago, but I was a bit rude

04:00.920 --> 04:03.960
and I just wanted to apologise.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.560
Yeah, I know, I know. I should have
turned you down to your face.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.760
Yeah, not put an advert
in the local paper.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.720

I thought this article
might help you.

I doubt there's anything that
could help me now, Lol,

04:45.320 --> 04:47.160
unless it's a second chance of life.

No, below that.

No, below that.
"24 great quiche recipes"?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.280
No, below that.
"My second chance at life"?

05:01.280 --> 05:03.640
Second chance at life, Mandy.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.800
That's what you need.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.840
Cryogenics.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.880
Freezing human life.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.400
I've never heard of cryogenics.
They've kept that quiet.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.080
No-one tells me anything.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.960
Well, it's still in its infancy,

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
like aromatherapy and ear candling.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.800
They freeze your body when you die

05:21.800 --> 05:23.480
and then in
a few hundred years' time

05:23.480 --> 05:26.360
when they've worked out what to do,
they bring you back to life.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.960
Hm. Amazing.
Yes. It's very expensive, though.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.000
How much? £80,000.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.360
Oh, Lol, why come here and tease me
with something I could never afford?

05:36.360 --> 05:38.760
Well, I still think we should go
and see them.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.920
Maybe you can pay in instalments.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.600
Just the head? You can freeze
just the head?

05:43.600 --> 05:46.800
Yes. It's only £30,000
and you can always decide later

05:46.800 --> 05:48.920
if you want to attach a donor body.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.960
But I've got lovely long legs.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.040
Will my donor have lovely long
legs?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.840
Well, it might be a case of beggars
not being choosers, I'm afraid,

05:55.840 --> 05:57.440
but I can always pop it
in your notes.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.560
Lovely long legs.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.000
And can anything go wrong?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.280
I'll be honest with you, Mandy,

06:07.280 --> 06:09.800
there are a great number
of things that can go wrong,

06:09.800 --> 06:11.640
the main one being pain.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.720
We just don't know how
the human body

06:13.720 --> 06:15.840
can handle being frozen for so long.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.920
There is a possibility
that you could be in great agony.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.960
Could you pop it me notes that
I'd like a couple of Nurofen?

06:23.880 --> 06:25.160
Yes.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.320
Nurofen.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.040
Also, Mandy - and I'm sure
you've already considered this -

06:30.040 --> 06:33.560
but, um...you won't know anybody.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.280
You'll be all alone
in the modern world.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.240
Why don't you get it done?
Then we can be thawed out together.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.600
We do have an offer on
at the moment.BOGOF?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.080
I don't know, Mandy.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.160
I feel like it's tampering
with nature,

06:45.160 --> 06:47.000
like Frankenstein or something.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.440
It's the future.

06:48.440 --> 06:53.800
I mean, imagine Einstein or
Isambard Kingdom Brunel being frozen

06:53.800 --> 06:56.800
and having the technology
now to revive them?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.640
Who? Imagine showing them
Google Maps.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.200
Yeah, or a fidget spinner.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.120
Or YouTube.
Yeah. Or Deliveroo.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.560
Would you like some fried chicken

07:04.560 --> 07:06.840
and a Fanta in the next 20 minutes,
man from the past?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.520

07:08.520 --> 07:10.760
You need a new hole punch,
with Amazon Prime,

07:10.760 --> 07:12.920
you can get it delivered
the very same day.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.800
Mm. They'd wonder with awe
at how far we'd come.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.760
Imagine showing them a plane!
Yeah, they'd shit their pants.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.760
Or TikTok.
OK!

07:22.480 --> 07:25.120
Um... If you take those pamphlets
away with you

07:25.120 --> 07:26.840

07:46.760 --> 07:48.960

07:48.960 --> 07:51.360
He looks very handsome.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.120
I hope this one doesn't mess her
around

07:53.120 --> 07:55.520
like all her other handsome,
young French boyfriends.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.960

I'd let you know

07:59.960 --> 08:02.320
I'm going to go home and
have me last meal

08:02.320 --> 08:04.440

It's massive, Lola.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.680
You don't want it to be hard
in the middle.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.200
No, I know. There's nothing worse.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.120
Did you microwave it first?No.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.880
Cos it's been in for a few days,
I thought it'd be fine.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.680
Did you prick it?
No!

08:20.680 --> 08:22.640
I've had a lot on me mind, Lola.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.720
I've had death threats,
I've had ancient curses,

trading in 2013,

in this normal front garden

literally hundreds of thousands

11:02.800 --> 11:05.920
of light years across the sky
and crashed here

11:05.920 --> 11:09.320
in this ordinary garden is amazing.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.360
As you can see, it's still

11:31.200 --> 11:32.440
Sounds like a porn name.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.000
No, I'm a scientist who's allowed to
speak to normal people

11:35.000 --> 11:36.520
because I've got a northern accent.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.960
But this comet, can I buy it off you
on behalf of the Science Museum

11:40.960 --> 11:42.600
for £20,000?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.960
Make it 30 and
you've got yourself a deal.

11:44.960 --> 11:49.520
Deal. You've done a great service
for science in this country.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.880
Thanks.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.840
I'll send a courier around
to pick it up.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.200
Oh, don't bother,
I'll pop it in a Jiffy bag.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.040
There she is.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.720
Come on, waking up now.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.320
Good, good, good, good.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.040
Mandy, we've brought you back
to life.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.520
The year is 3035 and, yeah,
you'll be pleased to hear

12:27.520 --> 12:31.360
that the thawing process
was a complete success.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.120
So, how are you feeling?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.920
I feel fine, actually.
OK, good.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
Now, even though we managed
to revive you,

12:37.920 --> 12:40.160
we are still looking for a donor.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.840
A donor? For what?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.400
For your body.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.880
Oh! Fucking hell!

12:50.880 --> 12:53.440
Would you like a Nurofen
or anything?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.520
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, actually.
A couple.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.360
And the naproxen as well,
if you want, just take the edge off.

12:58.360 --> 13:04.000
