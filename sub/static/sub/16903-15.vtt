WEBVTT

00:03.058 --> 00:04.078
I'd like to welcome everyone

00:04.161 --> 00:06.283
to this NBC employee
town hall meeting.

00:06.351 --> 00:08.685
And thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.377
Yeah, I'm supposed to be
drinking a soda right now.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.803
A special thanks to those
joining us via simulcast,

00:14.870 --> 00:16.918
Particularly you gentlemen
in the Tokyo office.

00:16.986 --> 00:18.299
I know it's late there.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.120
I don't know why you're wearing
girls' pajamas,

00:21.187 --> 00:23.632
But I'm sure it's cultural.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.366
I'm here to address concerns
regarding the acquisition

00:26.433 --> 00:29.557
Of our company
by Kabletown.

00:29.625 --> 00:30.895
With a K.

00:30.963 --> 00:33.539
This is an exciting time
for NBC.

00:33.607 --> 00:35.881
Not <i>Seinfeld, Friends, E.R.</i>
exciting.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.524
More like 3d episodes
of <i>Merlin</i> exciting.

00:38.592 --> 00:40.733
But I believe
this is a great opportunity

00:40.800 --> 00:43.176
For all of us because Kabletown
is a great company.

00:43.244 --> 00:46.019
Even if it is from...

00:46.087 --> 00:47.023
Philadelphia.

00:47.091 --> 00:49.367
Go Eagles!

00:49.435 --> 00:51.706
How did you even get
a snowball?

00:51.774 --> 00:53.914
Philly rules!
Cheesesteaks! Bobby clarke!

00:53.982 --> 00:55.886
Will Smith!
Your town sucks.

00:55.954 --> 00:57.390
You do not want
this argument, Lemon.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.521
Boston is the greatest city
in the world.

00:59.589 --> 01:00.925
Boo.
Boston tea party.

01:00.992 --> 01:03.498
Boston cream pie.
Boston Rob Mariano.

01:03.566 --> 01:05.135
Birthplace
of Benjamin Franklin.

01:05.203 --> 01:07.676
Yeah, then he looked around,
realized it sucked,

01:07.744 --> 01:09.681
And moved to Philadelphia!

01:09.748 --> 01:11.819
Oh, did you just whip
a battery at me?

01:11.887 --> 01:13.924
Mr. Donaghy, I'm sorry,
can we get back to the meeting?

01:13.992 --> 01:16.498
Of course. My apologies
to our friends

01:16.565 --> 01:19.036
from the great city
of Los Angeles.

01:21.844 --> 01:23.748
Hey. Stop laughing.
L.A. Rules.

01:23.816 --> 01:26.719
Michael Bay, freeways,
Legoland.

01:26.786 --> 01:28.290
Before I take
your questions,

01:28.358 --> 01:30.060
I'd like to say few words
about Don Geiss.

01:30.128 --> 01:32.900
The world has lost a giant.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.968
He built G.E.

01:34.036 --> 01:35.572
into the greatest company
on earth,

01:35.640 --> 01:37.075
And the earth into one of
the top three planets

01:37.142 --> 01:38.478
In the universe.

01:38.546 --> 01:41.083
For those of you wishing to pay
your respects,

01:41.150 --> 01:43.689
There will be an episcopal
cryogenic freezing service

01:43.756 --> 01:46.160
Open to all six sigma
black belts and higher.

01:46.228 --> 01:48.063
That's the craziest thing
I ever heard.

01:48.131 --> 01:49.233
Episcopal!

01:49.301 --> 01:52.573
Now the floor is open
to questions.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.144
I would be remiss if I didn't
honor our fallen leader

01:56.213 --> 01:58.181
With a song.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.517
This is for you,
Dan Goose.

02:28.008 --> 02:30.010
So how was your second date
with Wesley?

02:30.078 --> 02:32.013
Ah, well, you know
that scene in <i>Notting Hill</i>

02:32.081 --> 02:33.983
Where they have the romantic
date in the garden?

02:34.051 --> 02:36.219
Well, I would have rather
watched that terrible movie

02:36.287 --> 02:37.955
Five times than have hung out
with Wesley.

02:38.022 --> 02:39.791
So he's not
your future husband?

02:39.859 --> 02:41.026
He's not my future anything.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.929
You gave it a shot.
Good riddance.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.298
Nope.
I'm seeing him tonight.

02:44.366 --> 02:45.667
You are? Why?

02:45.735 --> 02:48.038
Well, this morning I was
buying an advanced ticket

02:48.106 --> 02:49.274
For the truffaut
retrospective

02:49.342 --> 02:51.512
At the anthology
film archives--

02:51.579 --> 02:53.815
One for the 8:00
<i>hot tub time machine.</i>

02:53.883 --> 02:55.483
Liz?

02:55.551 --> 02:57.851
Are we both seeing
<i>hot tub time machine</i> tonight?

02:57.919 --> 02:59.353
How does this keep
happening?

02:59.421 --> 03:02.458
If there is a god, liz,
I think that she...

03:02.525 --> 03:03.693
Ugh.

03:03.761 --> 03:05.028
Is trying to tell us
something.

03:05.096 --> 03:07.366
It's like the universe
keeps pushing us together.

03:07.434 --> 03:08.901
We can't shake each other.

03:08.969 --> 03:11.004
I had a thing where I kept
running in to michael douglas.

03:11.072 --> 03:13.041
But then I realized
it was just some old lady

03:13.109 --> 03:14.410
Who lives in my building.

03:14.477 --> 03:17.648
Lemon. A moment.

03:17.715 --> 03:20.218
We have a Tracy problem.

03:20.286 --> 03:21.987
Okay.
Escaped exotic animal

03:22.055 --> 03:23.556
Or did he swallow
another firecracker?

03:23.624 --> 03:24.825
I wish.

03:24.893 --> 03:27.262
Our old nanny wrote
a tell-all book about me.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.864
Oh, no.
It's bad.

03:28.932 --> 03:31.268
I just got the call
from a friend at little brown.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.337
The publishing house?

03:32.404 --> 03:34.172
No, the premier talent agency

03:34.240 --> 03:36.076
For black dwarves.

03:36.143 --> 03:38.246
Tracy, we need to start
doing damage control on this.

03:38.314 --> 03:39.548
What does she reveal
in the book?

03:39.616 --> 03:43.087
Everything. My addiction
to prescription glasses.

03:43.155 --> 03:46.393
The fact that I suffer from
attention deficit disor--

03:46.460 --> 03:48.061
Jack, your shoes are shiny.

03:48.129 --> 03:50.662
And worst of all,
she revealed the fact

03:50.730 --> 03:52.563
That I've never cheated
on my wife.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.131
Okay, well,
that's not true.

03:54.199 --> 03:55.399
Actually it is true.

03:55.466 --> 03:57.500
Tracy shared that with me
last year.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.135
What?
What about the strip clubs

03:59.202 --> 04:01.003
And the disgusting stories?

04:01.070 --> 04:03.939
Your ben & jerry's flavor
is called adulteraisin.

04:04.007 --> 04:06.274
That's all for show.

04:06.342 --> 04:08.043
I love my wife
and only her.

04:08.111 --> 04:10.643
Okay, and how is that
a bad thing?

04:10.711 --> 04:13.412
My wild and sexually
adventurous image

04:13.480 --> 04:16.048
Is how I make my money,
Liz Lemon.

04:16.115 --> 04:18.382
I start losing my endorsements,
Angie's gonna be madder

04:18.450 --> 04:20.084
Than a bat in a suitcase.

04:20.151 --> 04:22.017
Uh-oh.
Which reminds me.

04:23.652 --> 04:25.620
Gordon. Gordon.

04:26.723 --> 04:27.991
Gordon!
Oh!

04:29.194 --> 04:30.594
I'm sorry.
You have a problem

04:30.662 --> 04:32.728
With the science
of <i>hot tub time machine?</i>

04:32.796 --> 04:34.729
Not the time travel.
It's the hot tub.

04:34.797 --> 04:37.430
You don't just turn one on,
and it's immediately hot.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.865
I should know. I've been
in a hot tub two times.

04:39.933 --> 04:42.400
Well, I don't question
everything.

04:42.468 --> 04:43.768
Except for the snacks
I got for us.

04:43.836 --> 04:46.303
Yeah.
Seltzer and Mike and ikes.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.504
What did you want?
Popcorn?

04:47.571 --> 04:50.006
Yes.
Popcorn? At the cinema?

04:50.074 --> 04:52.074
And, by the way,
your food obsession

04:52.142 --> 04:53.275
Is not as endearing
as you think it is.

04:53.343 --> 04:56.078
It's like being
in a <i>cathy</i> cartoon

04:56.146 --> 04:57.314
That just won't end.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.583
Oh, my god,
I want to smash your face.

05:01.986 --> 05:04.335
I don't think
we were meant to be together.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.936
So why are you in my phone
as future husband,

05:07.037 --> 05:09.837
and why am I in yours
as future wife?

05:09.838 --> 05:11.138
I guess we'll never know.

05:11.539 --> 05:14.039
At least we'll always have
Dr. Kaplan's recovery room.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.140
It was our Paris.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.841
huh...to bad we can't go back there.

05:22.742 --> 05:24.642
Look at all these books, sir.

05:24.643 --> 05:25.943
Feel like I'm back at school

05:26.044 --> 05:28.144
learning about the dangers
of book readin.

05:28.145 --> 05:30.645
This is all research on
Kabletown.

05:30.646 --> 05:33.646
I'm trying to learn everything
I can about our future owners.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.947
G.E. gave me the finest
education know to man.

05:37.848 --> 05:39.848
I learned to develop
new products,

05:40.249 --> 05:41.749
innovate new technologies.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.350
We brought good things to life.

05:44.251 --> 05:46.151
and bad things to Chinese Rivers.

05:46.152 --> 05:48.052
G.E. is a great company.

05:48.453 --> 05:51.453
Second only to the company
of great friends.

05:51.803 --> 05:53.736
I thought I would workphone
at G.E. forever.

05:53.804 --> 05:55.804
But my future opportunities
at the company died

05:55.872 --> 05:57.573
With Don Geiss,
I have to accept that

05:57.640 --> 06:00.142
And move on to
this exciting new challenge.

06:00.209 --> 06:02.543
A friend of mine
has been worried

06:02.611 --> 06:05.377
They'll be bringing in
new page rules.

06:05.444 --> 06:08.775
Like age limits
and age verification.

06:08.843 --> 06:11.108
Truth be told,
I haven't learned a lot

06:11.175 --> 06:12.241
About Kabletown.

06:12.308 --> 06:14.976
It's a whole different
business model.

06:15.044 --> 06:17.811
My cousin in Atlanta
is a business model.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.213
She holds up staplers
in catalogues.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.014
But later today, I'm meeting
with an old colleague

06:22.082 --> 06:24.981
Who left G.E. For Kabletown
five years ago.

06:25.149 --> 06:27.749
I'm going to pick his brain
and learn how Kabletown works,s,

06:27.817 --> 06:30.148
So I can prove
that I am the man

06:30.216 --> 06:32.583
With the ambition,
the talent,

06:32.651 --> 06:36.054
And the looking-at-my-watch
skills to run this company.

06:36.122 --> 06:40.225
terrific, sir!

06:40.292 --> 06:41.993
So all we need you to do

06:42.061 --> 06:43.861
Is to put us under
anesthesia again.

06:43.929 --> 06:44.996
Wesley brought his video camera.

06:45.063 --> 06:46.697
In England,
we call it a film pod.

06:46.764 --> 06:47.931
No.

06:47.998 --> 06:50.032
And that way, afterward,
we can watch the tape

06:50.100 --> 06:51.599
And figure out
what our connection was.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.802
Would you ask a cardiologist
to do something like this?

06:53.870 --> 06:55.037
I am a real doctor.

06:55.105 --> 06:56.740
Yeah,
but a cardiologist is...

06:56.808 --> 06:58.342
I know
what a cardiologist is.

06:58.410 --> 07:00.510
My brother is a cardiologist,
and I'm just as good as he is.

07:00.578 --> 07:01.745
We drive the same car.

07:01.813 --> 07:03.846
So what if his wife
is more attractive?

07:03.914 --> 07:06.014
But Dr. Kaplan,
this is for love.

07:06.082 --> 07:08.416
It's like that brilliant film,
uh, <i>Notting Hill.</i>

07:08.484 --> 07:11.519
I'm british and charming,
and she's...

07:11.587 --> 07:13.921
Got certain angles
that work for her.

07:13.989 --> 07:16.723
Really?
You think you found "the one"

07:16.791 --> 07:18.125
In my recovery room.

07:18.192 --> 07:21.628
Let me show you
what happens in there.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.231
We are gonna hang out
so much after this.

07:25.299 --> 07:27.766
I want to take you
to the big apple circus

07:27.834 --> 07:30.668
'cause we're best friends.

07:35.173 --> 07:37.606
I don't think
there was any connection.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.040
It was just the anesthesia.

07:40.108 --> 07:42.608
Well, liz, I wish you
all the best.

07:42.676 --> 07:45.444
But future wife deleted.

07:45.511 --> 07:46.878
It's a good idea.

07:46.946 --> 07:50.248
And if my heart surgeon
brother is so great,

07:50.315 --> 07:52.282
How come so many
of his patients have died,

07:52.350 --> 07:54.984
But I've only killed
one guy, huh?

08:02.985 --> 08:04.818
Say it ain't so,
tray.

08:04.886 --> 08:07.120
What about the Seattle
Seahawks cheerleader?

08:07.188 --> 08:09.020
That one
kind of thick rockette?

08:09.087 --> 08:10.453
That blind woman

08:10.521 --> 08:12.420
In the business class
bathroom on the acela?

08:12.487 --> 08:13.988
Were those all lies too?

08:14.055 --> 08:15.588
But, Frank, I still party.

08:15.656 --> 08:17.287
I'm still terrible at my job.

08:17.355 --> 08:20.723
I looked up to you.
Now I hate you.

08:22.859 --> 08:25.026
Tracy, I know
what you're going through.

08:25.094 --> 08:26.394
I got a lot of flack

08:26.462 --> 08:28.429
After I ate the pig
that played babe.

08:28.497 --> 08:30.197
I learned you have
to go on the offensive.

08:30.265 --> 08:31.498
Start denying this stuff.

08:31.566 --> 08:32.900
I did, j-mo.

08:32.967 --> 08:35.335
I held a press conference
this morning.

08:35.403 --> 08:38.705
I'm here to announce
that I'm leaving show business

08:38.773 --> 08:41.274
To spend more time
with my stripper.

08:41.341 --> 08:44.309
But it's like
a black barbie doll in Arizona.

08:44.377 --> 08:45.643
Nobody's buying it.

08:45.711 --> 08:47.311
Well, we lost
another one, tray.

08:47.379 --> 08:48.779
I just got off the phone with
the people

08:48.847 --> 08:50.180
From horny goat weed.

08:50.248 --> 08:51.515
They're dropping you
as their spokesman.

08:51.582 --> 08:53.750
But John Edwards and I
were supposed to ride

08:53.818 --> 08:55.418
On their cinco de mayo float.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.155
Yet another
black superstar

09:00.223 --> 09:02.457
Taken down
by his personal life.

09:02.525 --> 09:06.161
Just like my favorite golfer
OJ Simpson.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.496
Remember how you tricked
the owner

09:08.563 --> 09:09.797
Of that toaster company
into thinking

09:09.864 --> 09:11.732
You were his dead son?

09:11.799 --> 09:14.000
And he sold you the factory
for $1.

09:14.068 --> 09:16.069
You are an animal.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.838
Dave "the animal" hess.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.539
I was only as good
as my mentor,

09:19.607 --> 09:22.473
The man who taught me
how to bait the enemy,

09:22.541 --> 09:25.975
Jack "the master baiter"
Donaghy.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.077
So, dave, tell me
all about Kabletown.

09:28.145 --> 09:30.746
What's their business strategy,
revenue streams?

09:30.814 --> 09:32.314
Do they have a preferred side
of the head

09:32.382 --> 09:33.849
For parting your hair,
because I've been continental

09:33.917 --> 09:35.684
For years,
but I'm willing to go western.

09:35.751 --> 09:38.053
Whoa, relax, buddy.
Your job is secure.

09:38.121 --> 09:39.754
I just want to understand
the operation

09:39.822 --> 09:41.222
So I can contribute
right away.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.791
Well, that's the beauty
of it, Jack.

09:42.859 --> 09:45.427
You don't have to.
The cable's already laid--

09:45.495 --> 09:47.729
I don't understand.
There's always room for growth,

09:47.797 --> 09:49.264
For innovation.
No, there really isn't.

09:49.332 --> 09:50.399
It's brilliant.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.234
And this is the goose

09:52.302 --> 09:54.002
That lays the golden eggs--

09:54.070 --> 09:56.738
Channels 500 through 600.

09:56.806 --> 09:59.274
Oh, good god.
<i>Ass-atar.</i>

09:59.342 --> 10:01.709
<i>The lovely boners.</i>
<i>The hind side.</i>

10:01.777 --> 10:05.446
<i>Based on the novel</i>
<i>"tush" by assfire.</i>

10:05.514 --> 10:07.715
It's all pay-per-view porn.

10:07.783 --> 10:09.250
Do you know
how much of our profit

10:09.317 --> 10:11.418
Comes from men
ordering adult movies?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.251
91%.

10:13.319 --> 10:14.752
They churn this stuff out,

10:14.820 --> 10:16.352
People at home push a button,

10:16.420 --> 10:17.853
And we make money
off it.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.921
We don't do anything.

10:19.988 --> 10:21.788
Then what do you want
with NBC?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.088
Why do you even want me?

10:23.156 --> 10:26.189
Well, buying NBC counts
as a charitable donation

10:26.256 --> 10:27.254
For tax purposes.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.954
And as for you,

10:29.022 --> 10:30.720
You're the classic
american executive.

10:30.788 --> 10:32.221
You will look great

10:32.288 --> 10:35.290
Standing behind our ceo
at press conferences.

10:35.357 --> 10:36.657
You are kidding me.

10:36.725 --> 10:37.991
I went to Harvard
business school.

10:38.059 --> 10:40.392
I'm the reason
the microwave tray rotates.

10:40.460 --> 10:41.760
Jack.
I make things.

10:41.828 --> 10:43.527
I build companies,
innovate products.

10:43.595 --> 10:45.796
Don't fight it, Jack.

10:45.863 --> 10:48.131
It's the perfect business.

10:48.199 --> 10:50.633
The war is over,
and we won.

10:55.805 --> 10:58.372

11:04.945 --> 11:07.312
Hey, I know
you're off-duty,

11:07.380 --> 11:08.747
But is there any chance
you would take me

11:08.814 --> 11:09.781
To the upper west side?

11:09.848 --> 11:12.749
Okay.
Oh, good catch.

11:12.817 --> 11:15.251
Thank you so much.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.020
ow.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.392
Bloody hell!

11:26.459 --> 11:28.093
No, no, no,
not again.

11:28.161 --> 11:31.329
That's not him, is it?

11:31.397 --> 11:33.965
Okay.
That was almost--

11:34.032 --> 11:35.866
Gangway for footcycle!

11:39.569 --> 11:43.437
Come on!
I said gangway for the...

11:43.505 --> 11:44.838

11:44.906 --> 11:47.274
No, no,
I am walking away.

11:47.342 --> 11:49.910
Wait, Liz, wait.
Look, I wasn't even supposed

11:49.978 --> 11:51.311
To ride
my footcycle home today.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.612
Stop calling it that.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.613
Yeah, fine, my velocipede,
but I did ride it

11:54.680 --> 11:58.349
Because the universe wanted me
to run into you again.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.851
And I finally think
I know why.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.619
Commencing
eye-roll sequence.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.688
The universe wants us
to settle for one another.

12:04.756 --> 12:06.123
Well, there has to be
a reason

12:06.191 --> 12:07.292
This keeps happening
to us, Liz.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.029
I think fate is telling us

12:10.097 --> 12:11.532
This is the best
we're ever gonna get.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.868
We're each other's
settling soul mates.

12:13.936 --> 12:16.706
Settling soul mates?
That is grim.

12:16.774 --> 12:18.509
And I've played
Monopoly alone.

12:18.576 --> 12:19.910
Well, I know
it's not ideal,

12:19.978 --> 12:21.277
But we'd both benefit.

12:21.345 --> 12:23.112
I mean, I could open jars
and kill bugs for you,

12:23.180 --> 12:25.946
And you could make me look
less gay at work functions.

12:26.014 --> 12:27.715
Look, I happen
to believe in roma--

12:27.783 --> 12:30.184
Don't even say
romantic love.

12:30.252 --> 12:32.319
How many couples do you know
that are actually in love,

12:32.387 --> 12:35.088
That don't completely annoy
one another?

12:35.156 --> 12:36.222
Okay, what about them?

12:36.290 --> 12:37.523
You wouldn't be complaining

12:37.590 --> 12:39.091
If you wore the shoes
I bought you.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.193
You're an old bitch.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.930
Why fight this?
Grow old with me, Liz?

12:45.998 --> 12:48.799
In separate bedrooms?
No way.

12:48.866 --> 12:50.367
Have a nice life.

12:50.434 --> 12:51.368
Think about it, Liz.

12:51.435 --> 12:53.136
It's what the universe wants.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.537
You'd have someone
to tell you

12:54.605 --> 12:56.839
When you're about to step
in something.

12:56.907 --> 12:59.040
Ah, nerds!

13:04.673 --> 13:06.741
Okay, mentor time.
I need a pep talk.

13:06.808 --> 13:09.477
Lemon, I'm not in the mood
to solve your lady problems

13:09.545 --> 13:11.645
Or listen to a story
about whatever escapee

13:11.713 --> 13:14.181
From the island of misfit toys
you're currently dating.

13:14.249 --> 13:16.784
No, this is
a Liz relationship emergency.

13:16.852 --> 13:18.084
It's a Liz-aster.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.921
Okay, Lemon.
What is it?

13:22.989 --> 13:25.825
okay.
Ever since I was little...

13:25.893 --> 13:28.361
No, faster than that.
My whole adult life...

13:28.429 --> 13:30.130
No!
Oprah says...

13:30.197 --> 13:33.566
You have ten seconds.
Okay, this guy Wesley

13:33.634 --> 13:34.701
Thinks we should get married

13:34.769 --> 13:37.804
Because it's time for us
to settle.

13:37.872 --> 13:41.344
Now that's completely
and totally wrong because...

13:41.411 --> 13:42.645
Is it?

13:42.712 --> 13:43.813
Maybe you should settle.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.549
Everybody settles.
What?

13:46.616 --> 13:47.783
Look at me.

13:47.851 --> 13:49.684
At one point,
my obituary was going to read,

13:49.752 --> 13:52.987
"CEO of G.E. dies violently
in a casino orgy."

13:53.055 --> 13:54.822
Now what's it going to say?

13:54.890 --> 13:56.591
"middle manager
of a Philadelphia

13:56.658 --> 13:58.459
Pornography distributor
never wakes up"?

13:58.527 --> 14:01.328
What are you talking about?
Kabletown.

14:01.396 --> 14:02.763
It's a mousetrap company.

14:02.831 --> 14:05.031
And you cannot build
a better mousetrap.

14:05.099 --> 14:07.366
Wait--Kabletown makes
mousetraps?

14:07.434 --> 14:09.900
Kabletown
doesn't make anything.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.636
Maybe it is
the perfect business.

14:11.703 --> 14:15.371
A perpetual motion machine
endlessly satisfying

14:15.439 --> 14:17.440
Every human need.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.175
Soon you won't even have
to leave your house.

14:19.243 --> 14:20.442
That sounds pretty good.

14:20.510 --> 14:21.709
They don't need ideas,

14:21.777 --> 14:23.441
They don't need innovation.

14:23.509 --> 14:25.977
In other words,
they don't need me.

14:27.312 --> 14:28.379
Wait, where are you going?

14:28.447 --> 14:29.914
I'm going to bury Don Geiss,

14:29.981 --> 14:33.016
America, and hope.

14:33.084 --> 14:34.551
hey.

14:34.618 --> 14:36.819
I saw some women came forward
to say

14:36.887 --> 14:37.854
You didn't have sex
with them.

14:37.921 --> 14:39.121
It's gotten worse.

14:39.189 --> 14:40.824
Somebody leaked my voicemails.

14:40.892 --> 14:43.527
Hey, baby,
it's your husband.

14:43.595 --> 14:45.062
So I'm at Bed Bath & Beyond,

14:45.130 --> 14:46.430
And I can't remember,

14:46.498 --> 14:49.467
Did you say to get metal
or wood shower curtain rings?

14:49.535 --> 14:51.803
Oh, you're calling me
on the other line.

14:51.871 --> 14:54.306
I can't wait to talk to you.
I love you.

14:54.373 --> 14:56.474
How does angie feel
about this? Is she mad?

14:56.542 --> 14:58.877
She says I better have
an affair and quick

14:58.945 --> 15:00.445
Before it tears
our family apart.

15:00.513 --> 15:02.046
I wish I could help you,

15:02.114 --> 15:03.648
But I can't sleep
with a black guy.

15:03.715 --> 15:05.416
I'd lose my endorsement deal
with NASCAR.

15:05.484 --> 15:06.818
That's the problem.

15:06.885 --> 15:08.419
Who's desperate enough
to have sex with me

15:08.487 --> 15:10.186
At this point?
Come on.

15:10.253 --> 15:11.720
You're still Tracy Jordan.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.688
There's got to be
some skank around here

15:13.756 --> 15:15.089
Who's made it very clear
she wants you.

15:15.157 --> 15:16.990
Go save your career

15:17.058 --> 15:18.957

15:24.294 --> 15:25.994
May I offer you

15:26.061 --> 15:27.828
What? No.
Why are you in here?

15:30.364 --> 15:32.031
Let me do a dance for you,
my lover.

15:40.972 --> 15:43.273
No.
No, this is wrong.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.774

15:47.244 --> 15:48.344
Wow. Okay.

15:48.412 --> 15:50.846
That was not gonna happen
for many reasons

15:50.913 --> 15:51.979
Besides you loving your wife.

15:52.047 --> 15:53.881
Reason one: I am conscious.

15:53.949 --> 15:55.649
Reason two:
You smell like icy hot.

15:55.717 --> 15:57.050
Reason three--
I'm sorry, L.L.

15:57.118 --> 15:58.952
I know how much you wanted this
to happen.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.520

Stop it.
Just embrace the fact

16:06.894 --> 16:09.297
That you are lucky enough
to be a happily married man.

16:09.365 --> 16:11.332
I mean,
I'm actually jealous of you.

You've got stability,
a great marriage,

16:17.904 --> 16:20.639
So quit whining
and be grateful.

16:20.707 --> 16:23.008
I am lucky.
Thanks, Liz Lemon.

To jabber.

18:47.285 --> 18:48.652
And it doesn't matter
if you have a headache,

18:48.720 --> 18:50.386
Or you're not in the mood,

18:50.454 --> 18:52.354
Or you're about to go
to Don Geiss's funeral,

18:52.422 --> 18:53.789
They barge
right into your office

18:53.857 --> 18:55.090
And start complaining
about a boyfriend

18:55.158 --> 18:56.291
Or a coworker.

18:56.359 --> 18:57.725
And you're supposed
to sit there and nod

18:57.793 --> 18:59.060
And tell them they're right.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.961
And the more you give it
to them, the more they want it.

19:01.029 --> 19:03.329
I'll tell you, sometimes
my wife will be blathering on

19:03.397 --> 19:05.130
About something,
and I'll think,

19:05.198 --> 19:06.731
I'm more
than just a pair of ears.

19:06.799 --> 19:08.233
You know, I'm a person

19:08.301 --> 19:10.236
Who thinks about sex
every seven seconds.

19:10.304 --> 19:11.504
Exactly.

19:11.572 --> 19:13.506
So what if women had
a pay-per-view channel

19:13.573 --> 19:16.808
Featuring handsome men
patiently listening to them?

19:16.876 --> 19:20.381
What if they had...
Porn for women?

19:20.449 --> 19:24.219
Okay, but where does
that content come from?

19:24.287 --> 19:26.154
From us.
We make it.

19:26.221 --> 19:28.288
Jack.
We don't make...

19:28.356 --> 19:29.988
Hear me out.
Yes, I'm talking about

19:30.055 --> 19:32.021
Doubling pay-per-view
profits

19:32.089 --> 19:34.156
While cutting out the middle
man, but I'm also talking

19:34.224 --> 19:37.059
About american businessmen doing
what they were born to do--

19:37.127 --> 19:38.560
Make things.

19:38.628 --> 19:40.228
We've stopped making

19:40.296 --> 19:41.896
And become a country
of consumers.

19:41.964 --> 19:45.599
Well, I, for one,
am done consuming.

19:45.666 --> 19:48.000
And I'm ready to make.

19:58.309 --> 20:01.177
Liz?
I don't believe it.

20:01.245 --> 20:02.478
Hello, Wesley.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.279
Don't you see this is
just gonna keep happening?

20:04.347 --> 20:05.613
You can't fight the universe.

20:05.681 --> 20:07.048
No, this isn't a coincidence.

20:07.116 --> 20:08.516
I wanted to see you,
and I figured

20:08.584 --> 20:11.853
You wouldn't miss a tasting
of the white wines of Scotland.

20:11.921 --> 20:13.321
Most restaurants refuse
to serve them.

20:13.389 --> 20:15.456
Oh, yeah, you've only told me
that, like, nine times.

20:15.524 --> 20:17.258
So does this mean
you've come to your senses?

20:17.325 --> 20:19.693
Are you ready to settle
and become Mrs. Snipes?

20:19.761 --> 20:22.395
No. I wanted to tell you
to your face

20:22.462 --> 20:23.629
That I know
that I can do better than you.

20:23.697 --> 20:25.931
And I am never gonna be
Mrs. Snipes.

20:25.998 --> 20:27.899
Hang on, is your name
Wesley Snipes?

20:27.967 --> 20:30.001
That is insane!
No, it's insane

20:30.068 --> 20:32.202
That the actor Wesley Snipes
has that name.

20:32.270 --> 20:34.437
If you saw a picture of him
and a picture of me,

20:34.505 --> 20:38.107
And you were asked, "who should
be named Wesley Snipes?"

20:38.175 --> 20:39.975
You'd pick the pale englishman
every time.

20:40.042 --> 20:41.509
Every time, Liz.

20:41.577 --> 20:43.178
Frankly, you should be having
this conversation with him.

20:43.245 --> 20:46.947
Yeah.
I'm gonna go do that.

20:47.015 --> 20:48.715
I give you two months
before you give up

20:48.783 --> 20:50.717
And decide to settle!

20:50.785 --> 20:52.118
I'll see you in May!

20:52.186 --> 20:53.653
For sweeps!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.654
That's what we call
spring cleaning in England.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.895
Hello there.
Well, hello.

21:05.963 --> 21:08.764
How was your day?
Do you need to talk?

21:08.831 --> 21:11.700
'cause I'll just listen
patiently and say things like,

21:11.767 --> 21:15.003
"uh-huh,"
"how annoying,"

21:15.070 --> 21:17.838
"she's clearly
jealous of you,"

21:17.906 --> 21:20.074
And "well, it's his loss."

21:20.142 --> 21:23.844
You're a great woman.
You deserve a great man.

21:23.912 --> 21:25.646
For just $24.95 an hour.

21:25.714 --> 21:28.282
Yes, please.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.850
It's the yellow button,
sweetie.
