00:29.562 --> 00:31.860
You must be some kind of
a driver, Michael Knight.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.398
I thought you
said she was blind!

00:34.534 --> 00:36.968
Seeing isn't
necessarily knowing.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.062
I heard that shot ring out.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.503
I want the eyewitness.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.200
Maybe he's just
angry at someone.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.505
He's angry at someone,
all right.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.039
KITT, where are we?

00:49.115 --> 00:51.015
Inside the compactor.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.722
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:07.801 --> 01:10.395
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.503 --> 01:12.266
who does not exist.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.469
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.547 --> 01:23.141
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.216 --> 01:25.241
the helpless, the powerless

01:25.318 --> 01:28.515
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.464
No problem, Alfredo.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.764
Your friend here just
can't hold his tequila.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.338
Go back to work.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.377
I understand.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.380
No, if we agree
to accept the case,

03:36.449 --> 03:38.314
we'll agree to your
terms and conditions.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.180
I have papers,
evidence against him.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.189
I will give you the papers,
but if he finds out,

03:47.260 --> 03:48.318
he will kill me.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.320
Don't worry.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.095
We'll have someone there
for you.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.861
Now, if you'll just
give me your name.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.438
Devon, how do you know
it's not a crank caller?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.606
I mean, maybe he's just
angry at someone.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.207
He's angry at someone,
all right.

04:12.285 --> 04:16.051
The difference is, the man he's
angry with is Louis Gastner.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.860
Michael, here is
the police arrest report

04:30.970 --> 04:32.597
on Louis Gastner.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.435
Gastner, Louis R. Age: 54.

04:35.508 --> 04:36.634
White male.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.872
Eight arrests for grand theft,
larceny, and extortion.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.811
Name a crime,
and he's been accused of it.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.577
Only problem is nobody's been
able to get a conviction on him.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.551
This "evidence drop, "
as you call it,

04:46.619 --> 04:49.452
is all very strange
and unorthodox, Michael.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.547
And so is that cap
you're wearing.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.922
Hey, it's my ID.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.027
It's what the caller ordered.
All part of the plan.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.530
I don't think
I'm going to like this.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.329
Relax. Piece of cake.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.561
I've heard that before.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.036
For instance, when we went up
against Goliath.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.039
No, Michael,
it's this location.

05:08.107 --> 05:10.075
Parking lots depress me.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.338
With all these cars? I thought
you'd feel right at home.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.903
It's precisely
all these cars that bother me.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.347
Here they sit,
left in the sweltering sun,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.442
for all
practical purposes forgotten

05:19.519 --> 05:22.682
while their owners browse
in air-conditioned comfort.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.552
Don't take it personally.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.991
There's row D. Here we go.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.894
All right. I was told
to wait in the mall.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.534
You wait here.
Informant will come by

05:37.603 --> 05:41.733
and drop the evidence in the
window in about two minutes.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.207
Now I'm a mobile mailbox.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.074
All right, Devon wants
a visual on this,

05:46.145 --> 05:47.976
so I'm activating
your video camera.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.606
You buzz me
when he makes the drop, okay?

05:51.684 --> 05:53.083
Despite what you may think,

05:53.152 --> 05:56.019
I'm perfectly capable of
handling my responsibilities.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.784
Boy, you're touchy.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.992
What did you do? Wake up on the
wrong side of the garage this morning?

06:01.060 --> 06:02.425
Very funny.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.448
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.959
John, where are you going?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.324
I'll be right back.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.282
Michael, this could
be our informant now.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.942
I got you, KITT.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.521
John.

07:49.936 --> 07:50.903
John.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.633
Don't move him!

07:56.742 --> 07:58.039
All right.
Call the paramedics!

07:58.110 --> 07:59.202
I will call them!

07:59.278 --> 08:01.712
All right, everybody, back!
Stay back!

08:28.908 --> 08:31.672
I suppose this is your idea
of a piece of cake?

08:31.744 --> 08:34.235
Thanks for the reminder,
smart guy.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.912
Let's get some history
on his plates, huh.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.122
KITT, are we clear
to Turbo Boost?

09:17.189 --> 09:20.158
No, Michael. There's a school
bus trapped behind the truck!

09:31.304 --> 09:33.636
Can you pick 'em up
with your scanner?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.702
They're out of range.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.300
I'm afraid
we've lost them, Michael.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.869
Them and 10 years
off my life.

10:03.135 --> 10:04.102
Aw!

10:08.841 --> 10:11.241
You know how I feel
about that car.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.112
It's potentially
incriminating.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.011
Yeah, but that's my car.
I love that car.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.107
I hand wax it
every weekend.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.049
Changes the oil
himself, too.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.950
Look, Mr. Gastner,
give me a break.

10:22.021 --> 10:25.855
I'll stash it. I'll have my brother
drive it over the state line.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.456
Okay.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.964
Stash it. Stash it good.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.432
Now I want that evidence
and the guy

10:37.536 --> 10:39.299
who stole it,
no matter who he is.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.963
You understand me?

10:41.774 --> 10:44.937
You shot a guy.
Left an eyewitness.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.708
Said so yourself.
She looked right at you.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.874
You screwed up.
That's human.

10:53.419 --> 10:56.411
I'm forgiving.
That's me. All heart.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.454
To a point.

10:59.525 --> 11:01.356
I want the eyewitness.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.055
That was a close one.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.621
You'd better
find that girl.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.030
Oscar, let her down.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.094
Easy!

11:43.602 --> 11:46.127
Are you going to be okay
in this parking lot?

11:46.238 --> 11:48.365
This is a hospital,
not a shopping center.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.932
By definition, there's a valid
reason for every car here.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.376
I'm quite comfortable,
thank you.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.308
Anything to keep you happy.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.629
Excuse me, I'm lookin' for
a Julie Robinson?

12:11.697 --> 12:12.686
Down the hall.

12:12.765 --> 12:13.754
Thank you.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.131
Dr. Jackson, Treatment Room 1.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.294
Dr. Jackson, Treatment Room 1.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.670
Excuse me,
are you Julie Robinson?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.107
Mm-hmm.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.609
My name is Michael Knight.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.873
I'm with the Foundation
for Law and Government.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.610
I'm the one John was supposed
to meet in the parking lot today.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.710
John didn't say anything
about meeting anyone.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.778
Whether he said
anything or not,

12:36.856 --> 12:38.790
he had some evidence
to deliver.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.383
Now, I've spoken to the
paramedics and the hospital,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.360
but nobody seems to know
anything about it.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.953
Look, uh,

12:45.564 --> 12:48.465
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.559
John and I were
simply going shopping

12:52.138 --> 12:54.572
when someone shot him
for no reason.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.533
Look, I know this doesn't
seem to be the right time

12:57.643 --> 12:59.338
to ask questions,

12:59.645 --> 13:02.136
but, Julie, you were there.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.540
You must've seen
where he hid the evidence.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.641
Miss Robinson?

13:05.718 --> 13:06.650
Yes.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.210
The doctor's with John now
if you'd like to see him.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.449
Thank you. Sugar?

13:42.922 --> 13:45.857
Michael, I sense
something is bothering you.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.487
KITT, our eyewitness
to the shooting is blind.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.757
But she moved
with such certainty.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.298
Surely I would've noticed.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.798
She also insists
that John Murray

13:54.867 --> 13:56.630
had nothing to do
with the evidence drop.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.430
Do you believe her?

13:58.537 --> 13:59.970
I don't know. We'll see.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.869
Let's hang out here a minute.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.205
She should be out
pretty soon.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.039
What about the Porsche?
Any luck?

14:06.111 --> 14:08.739
The car in question is
registered to a David Dudley.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.476
Insofar as it was involved
in an attempted homicide

14:11.550 --> 14:14.041
shouldn't we share this
information with the police?

14:14.119 --> 14:16.280
KITT, the guy
called the Foundation

14:16.355 --> 14:18.255
because he couldn't go
to the police.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.258
We've got to honor
that confidence.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.659
I doubt I'll ever grasp
this human need for secrets.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.166
Thank you.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.708
You're welcome.

14:49.622 --> 14:53.217
Michael, there's a car approaching
that girl at high speed.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.998
What was that black car?

15:09.108 --> 15:11.576
I don't know,
but that girl, she's blind.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.612
Sure?
As sure as I'm sittin' here.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.704
So much
for our eyewitness.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.377
You all right?

15:20.452 --> 15:21.350
Most of me.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.786
Thanks for
cutting that maniac off.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.153
You know what happened?

15:25.224 --> 15:27.852
A car was coming at me
from over there.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.418
You seemed to be coming at me
from over there.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.090
You must be some kind of
a driver, Michael Knight.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.895
Wait a minute.
How'd you know it was me?

15:36.001 --> 15:37.366
I heard you.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.744
I think whoever tried
to kill John

15:45.844 --> 15:48.404
thinks you're an eyewitness
just like I did.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.606
What if they still do.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.114
Michael.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.310
Sorry, pal.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.185
I know how you feel
about dogs as passengers,

15:56.255 --> 15:57.813
but this one's
well trained.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.791
Training is one thing,
obeying is quite another.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.660
You've got a computer
in your car.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.459
No, Julie,
the computer is the car.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.467
KITT, introduce yourself
to Julie Robinson.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.593
I'm pleased to meet you,
Miss Robinson.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.171
A talking car.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.731
Well, now it's my turn
to be impressed.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.104
KITT, is it?
What an intriguing voice.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.271
A little too much gain
in your tweeter,

16:21.347 --> 16:23.440
and a slight metallic tone
to your bass.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.278
Do you really think so?

17:03.789 --> 17:04.778
Make yourself at home.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.417
I'm gonna take Sugar's harness
off and give her some water.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.153
Julie, this place
is beautiful.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.960
Thank you.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.131
Hey, this painting
looks just like Sugar.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.707
Sugar wasn't even born
when I painted that.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.502
I was 17
when I lost my sight.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.105
I painted until then.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.742
And now,
with John's help, I sculpt.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.910
Wow!

17:35.888 --> 17:38.083
I guess the two of you
are real close, huh.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.127
Close? In a way, yes.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.732
You must know
why he brought you

17:47.800 --> 17:50.132
to the shopping center
at that particular time.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.671
We were going to buy supplies
at the art store

17:54.273 --> 17:56.241
at that particular time.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.908
Now, Julie...

17:59.244 --> 18:00.768
You don't believe me, do you?

18:00.879 --> 18:03.177
Well, it's not that
I don't believe you,

18:03.215 --> 18:05.115
but isn't it possible
John didn't tell you

18:05.184 --> 18:07.049
his real reason
for being in there?

18:07.119 --> 18:08.279
No.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.183
How can you be so sure?

18:10.389 --> 18:12.914
The same way I knew
you didn't believe me.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.453
I could hear it
in your voice.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.529
I would've known if John
had been worried or anxious.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.087
No, it's just not possible.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.497
All right. Then why was he
reachin' for my car?

18:22.601 --> 18:23.727
What makes you think
he was?

18:23.836 --> 18:24.768
I saw him.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.773
Michael, seeing isn't
necessarily knowing,

18:28.907 --> 18:30.340
or understanding.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.504
I heard that shot ring out.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.140
I could feel John was hurt.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.747
And all I could do
was just stand there.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.251
All right.

18:42.754 --> 18:46.246
Julie, I got a video tape of
what happened out there today.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.452
I want you
to take a look at it.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.859
Maybe you can hear
or feel somethin' I missed.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.296
All right.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.425
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.969
John, where are you going?

18:59.037 --> 18:59.969
I'll be right back.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.039
John.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.744
John was going after Sugar,
my dog.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.512
She didn't have
her harness on,

19:11.583 --> 19:14.643
and when John opened the
door, she slipped out.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.450
Miss Robinson,
Sugar is not in the picture.

19:18.223 --> 19:21.056
Why, she has to be.
I can hear her.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.155
Could you please
play back the tape?

19:26.865 --> 19:27.991
Sure.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.309
There. Do you hear her?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.645
Devon, what's that?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.750
A dog's tail, Michael.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.426
I've run every possible check
on John Murray. He's clean.

19:55.494 --> 19:59.123
The man who called me on the
telephone had a Spanish accent.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.961
Our John is not a Latino.

20:01.033 --> 20:01.965
He's Irish.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.262
Don't move him!

20:04.403 --> 20:05.631
All right.
Call the paramedics!

20:05.737 --> 20:06.726
I'll call them!

20:06.838 --> 20:08.601
There's your Latino.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.437
Don't move him!

20:13.512 --> 20:14.945
All right.
Call the paramedics!

20:15.013 --> 20:16.537
I will call them!

20:16.615 --> 20:18.515
He does have an accent.

20:18.750 --> 20:22.083
I'll try to blow it up,
but we'll lose some clarity.

20:23.922 --> 20:28.052
Miss Robinson, you really are
an excellent eyewitness.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.326
Thank you.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.407
This is Gastner's place.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.037
Let's see
what we can find out.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.342
It's gonna be tough.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.781
It's a long shot, but I
think Gastner's involved.

21:30.255 --> 21:33.452
I fail to see the logic
of what we're doing here.

21:34.493 --> 21:37.462
Tryin' a long shot, pal,
maybe we'll get lucky.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.429
It's worse than I imagined.

21:39.498 --> 21:40.658
Yeah, I know.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.529
Because everybody
has an accent.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.501
No. That machine.
That horrible machine.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.935
Look what it's doing.

21:47.005 --> 21:47.972
Wow.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.931
And you thought
parkin' lots were bad.

22:02.421 --> 22:03.353
Hello.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.582
Yeah?

22:04.923 --> 22:07.118
I'm lookin' for a guy
named Dudley.

22:07.192 --> 22:08.181
Dave Dudley.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.285
He brought his Porsche
by my house yesterday

22:10.362 --> 22:12.296
said he wanted
to trade it for my car.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.265
Thought I might take him up
on his offer, Mr...

22:15.334 --> 22:16.596
Gastner.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.666
Nobody named
Dudley works here.

22:19.938 --> 22:20.905
You sure?

22:20.972 --> 22:21.904
Yeah.

22:22.874 --> 22:25.240
But if you find him,
take him up on his offer.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.835
You'll be getting
the best end of the deal.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.712
All right.
Let's get back to work.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.784
Spoken like a true barbarian.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.149
Did you say somethin'?

22:43.228 --> 22:44.422
I certainly did.

22:44.496 --> 22:47.260
That awful man is an insult
to the human race

22:47.332 --> 22:48.890
and the automotive industry.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.491
He belongs behind bars.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.968
No argument from me
on that one.

22:53.772 --> 22:57.071
KITT, the guy seemed
pretty sure of himself.

22:57.709 --> 23:01.008
I think Dudley and his pal
realized Julie really is blind.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.343
Then we're back
to square one.

23:03.415 --> 23:06.009
Maybe. Maybe not.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.447
Give me all you've got
on David Dudley.

23:09.521 --> 23:12.854
Personal habits,
hobbies, friends.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.923
Give me the works.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.790
Dudley used to play
semi-pro football.

23:17.863 --> 23:21.026
On his time off, he hangs
around in the Second Avenue park.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.192
That gives me an idea, KITT.

23:33.111 --> 23:36.808
The way John's improving, he
should be able to talk pretty soon.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.780
Well, I'm still not sure
I understand your plan.

23:39.851 --> 23:41.512
I thought
you were after Gastner.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.850
We are. But as long
as Dudley and his buddy

23:43.922 --> 23:45.617
are running interference
for him,

23:45.690 --> 23:47.351
we're gonna have
to nail 'em first.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.018
But they know I'm blind.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.322
Julie, you said it yourself:

23:50.395 --> 23:53.728
"Seeing isn't necessarily
knowing or understanding. "

23:54.433 --> 23:56.799
Don't worry about a thing.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.268
KITT's gonna take
real good care of you.

24:27.098 --> 24:28.963
Am I doing all right, KITT?

24:29.067 --> 24:32.332
With a little more practice,
we could enter the Indy 500.

24:32.437 --> 24:33.802
Flatterer.

24:39.244 --> 24:40.871
Go! Go! Go! Go!

24:43.548 --> 24:45.448
There's Dudley, Julie.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.713
Good. He saw you.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.522
Dudley, look!
Look, it's that broad.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.791
I thought you said
she was blind!

24:54.860 --> 24:56.418
You said she was!
Come on!

24:56.495 --> 24:57.985
Barbara, wait here!

25:11.910 --> 25:14.037
I believe
Michael's ploy is working.

25:14.112 --> 25:16.171
Good.
Pedal to the metal, KITT.

25:29.394 --> 25:32.090
This is Officer Peter Gray.
42786.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.324
I've just spotted
a blind girl driving a car.

25:34.399 --> 25:35.457
Please advise.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.215
Looks like the little lady
ran out of space.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.686
Yeah. She's run
out of luck, too.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.750
Hey, open the door.
Open the door.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.052
Open the door.
Come on!

26:03.795 --> 26:06.958
Don't worry, Julie,
everything will be all right.

26:17.375 --> 26:18.740
Well, what are you
yelling for?

26:18.810 --> 26:20.778
The car moved.
It's got my foot.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.546
It's got my foot!

26:25.383 --> 26:26.372
No, no, no!

26:37.062 --> 26:38.529
Julie, you all right?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.064
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.330
Somebody's under arrest.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.913
April, there's no way
I can identify the man.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.645
He could just
as easily be me.

27:00.752 --> 27:01.980
I know.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.079
I'm sorry, Michael.
It's the best I could do.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.144
Okay.

27:05.223 --> 27:08.056
Michael, I'm afraid
your plan may not pay off.

27:09.227 --> 27:11.957
The police have questioned
Dudley and Mel to no avail.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.260
The sports car you described
has disappeared.

27:14.332 --> 27:15.993
And there's simply
no concrete evidence

27:16.101 --> 27:18.569
linking them
to John Murray's shooting.

27:18.703 --> 27:21.467
Well, at least we've kept them
out of action for 24 hours.

27:26.511 --> 27:27.705
Hello?

27:28.046 --> 27:29.411
Oh, hi, Julie.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.979
Oh, that's wonderful.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.611
Yeah. Sure, I'll tell him.

27:35.787 --> 27:36.981
Bye-bye.

27:37.622 --> 27:38.850
Good news.

27:38.923 --> 27:40.447
John's regained consciousness.

27:40.525 --> 27:41.992
That is good news.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.654
Maybe we've got
an eyewitness after all.

27:57.042 --> 28:00.341
Michael, I've been thinking.
If I adjusted my bass

28:00.412 --> 28:05.076
an octave or so, perhaps
it might sound more mellow.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.445
What do you think?

28:07.519 --> 28:10.545
KITT, will you stop worrying
about your voice?

28:10.622 --> 28:13.352
It's fine.
I like it just the way it is.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.256
You wouldn't fib to me,
would you?

28:15.326 --> 28:16.384
Never.

28:16.461 --> 28:19.259
Michael, I've been thinking
about David Dudley's sports car.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.958
I'm afraid it may have met
with a dreadful end.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.159
I don't follow.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.236
It's occurred to me
that insofar as the car

28:25.336 --> 28:27.327
is essentially evidence
in the shooting,

28:27.439 --> 28:29.202
those hoodlums
may have disposed of it

28:29.274 --> 28:31.265
in that crusher
at the wrecking yard.

28:31.376 --> 28:35.039
Oh. Well, that would make a
compact out of it, wouldn't it?

28:35.780 --> 28:37.907
I fail to see the humor
in that.

28:37.982 --> 28:42.180
It's a most humiliating way to
go, transformed into a tin can.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.856
Well, I'll remember that
the next time I have sardines.

28:46.124 --> 28:49.287
Really, Michael. Sometimes
you're so insensitive.

29:07.879 --> 29:11.508
John, I'm real sorry you got
caught in the middle of this.

29:12.183 --> 29:15.949
It's just a matter of being at
the wrong place at the wrong time.

29:16.554 --> 29:19.785
I was trying to help Julie,
and she was telling me not to.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.849
That's the way
it is with us.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.754
Where is she, anyway?

29:24.129 --> 29:25.824
Probably down
at the cafeteria

29:25.897 --> 29:27.990
telling them
how to cook my food.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.233
I got it. Thank you.
Okay, straight ahead.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.170
Thank you, Julie.

29:40.478 --> 29:41.604
They're beautiful.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.237
They smell good, too.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.613
John, we're trying
to put this puzzle together,

29:53.691 --> 29:55.818
but we're missin'
a few pieces.

29:55.894 --> 29:59.728
Oh. I don't know what I can
do to help, but anything I can.

30:01.032 --> 30:03.262
Do you remember right
after you were shot,

30:03.368 --> 30:05.268
a man callin' out
for the paramedics?

30:05.336 --> 30:06.826
He was a Latino.

30:07.005 --> 30:07.972
Yeah.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.066
Yeah, I think I remember him.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.269
One minute he was
comin' toward me,

30:14.345 --> 30:16.905
like he was going
to help me catch Sugar,

30:17.348 --> 30:18.975
then he was gone.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.113
We think he's the key
to the whole situation here.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.679
If you saw this guy again,
you think you'd recognize him?

30:26.324 --> 30:28.121
I don't think so. No.

30:29.961 --> 30:32.020
I was paying
more attention to Sugar.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.997
Then, when I got shot
everything went black.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.798
I'm sorry.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.493
Visiting hours
are almost over.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.834
I was hoping you could
stay a little longer.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.669
I'll be back.
You get your rest.

30:43.741 --> 30:44.708
Julie.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.137
Thanks a lot, John.
Hang in there.

31:02.493 --> 31:03.619
Where're you goin'?

31:03.695 --> 31:04.821
The wreckin' yard.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.160
I'll find out which one
of the Latinos speaks English.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.291
We'll talk to every single
one of them if we have to.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.028
Listen,
I appreciate your help,

31:11.135 --> 31:13.660
but maybe you should
stay here with John.

31:14.105 --> 31:17.074
He's doing fine.
And he's in the best of care.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.405
Besides, you have no idea
who you're looking for,

31:19.477 --> 31:21.468
and I know exactly
what he sounds like.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.343
I think you need me.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.218
You know what I think?

31:28.286 --> 31:30.982
You're right. I do. Let's go.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.281
You know, Julie,

31:35.360 --> 31:38.227
I don't think I'm the
only one who needs you.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.398
Come on, Sugar.
Come on, come on.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.331
Come on, come on.
In you go.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.696
Okay.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.588
"Now is the winter
of my discontent

32:08.660 --> 32:11.527
made glorious summer
by the sun of York. "

32:11.596 --> 32:12.585
Say what?

32:13.798 --> 32:17.791
Shakespeare. I wanted Julie to
hear the tonal purity of my voice.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.001
Very nice. Really.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.965
But do I detect a slight
reverberation in your treble?

32:23.074 --> 32:26.009
That does it.
My tweeters are sealed.

32:30.715 --> 32:33.240
Is something
bothering you, Michael?

32:34.953 --> 32:37.421
Well, I can't hide much
from you, can I?

32:37.822 --> 32:40.416
This time
it's simple female intuition.

32:41.826 --> 32:42.884
What's wrong?

32:42.961 --> 32:45.259
Nothin's wrong, Julie.
I'm just curious.

32:45.330 --> 32:46.524
About?

32:46.597 --> 32:48.121
About you and John.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.929
I told you, Michael,
we're close-

32:51.536 --> 32:54.004
I know you said
you're close in ways.

32:54.605 --> 32:57.403
Just wondering
if that's how John sees it.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.367
No pun intended?

33:00.378 --> 33:03.074
Julie, maybe you're too busy
proving you don't need anybody,

33:03.147 --> 33:05.581
you're overlookin'
someone who needs you.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.016
Someone who loves you
very much.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.001
KITT, is Gastner around?

33:32.910 --> 33:34.844
Now he's not talkin'.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.481
Gastner's car isn't here.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.643
Be careful.
This place feels dangerous.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.462
Hello!

34:05.276 --> 34:07.141
Mi nombre is Michael Knight.

34:07.945 --> 34:11.005
I'm from The Foundation
for Law and Government.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.414
Your boss, uh, Louis Gastner.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.946
He's a bad man,
you know that.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.954
One of you guys called
the Foundation for help.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.155
We're here.
We want to help.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.130
But you guys
got to talk to me.

34:28.632 --> 34:31.329
Please, one of you,
tell me what's goin' on.

34:39.476 --> 34:42.105
KITT, that voice over
the bullhorn, that's him.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.612
Are you positive, Julie?

34:43.681 --> 34:44.705
Absolutely.

34:44.782 --> 34:48.217
Michael, Julie's identified
the man with the bullhorn.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.413
Wait!
I'm Michael Knight. Stop!

34:51.556 --> 34:53.387
Hey, stop.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.387
KITT, run some
interference for me.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.425
Hold on, Julie.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.686
Look, I want to help. I
just wanna talk to you.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.385
Open the door, KITT!

35:29.460 --> 35:30.484
I'm Michael Knight.

35:30.561 --> 35:33.359
I'm with the Foundation.
Come on, get in.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.634
You make
a terrible mistake, senor.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.407
My name's Alfredo Diaz

35:49.480 --> 35:52.074
and I work for Mr. Gastner
for five years.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.913
But I'm an honest man.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.452
Alfredo, I'm sure you are.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.511
That's why you called us
in the first place.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.089
That's why I'm here now.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.784
He's the one, Michael.
I'm positive.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.658
Alfredo, if you called the
Foundation you must've been desperate.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.255
We're ready to help.
Why don't you let us?

36:10.535 --> 36:12.196
Allow me, Michael.

36:18.576 --> 36:21.409
All right. Maybe Devon
will have better luck.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.455
Come on, Sugar.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.865
That poor man must be
frightened to death.

36:43.968 --> 36:45.663
Julie, it's for
his own good.

36:45.770 --> 36:49.706
Gastner would do a lot more than
scare him if he'd found him first.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.841
Look, I really don't like
leavin' you alone here.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.741
I'm not alone.
I've got Sugar.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.905
You'll be at
the hospital later, right?

36:56.981 --> 37:00.075
And you've got my number at
the Foundation if you need me.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.712
Okay. Now, lock the door and
don't let anybody in, okay?

37:08.492 --> 37:11.222
Um, I've been thinking
about what you said.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.154
Maybe it's true.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.756
Maybe I've been trying
so hard to be independent

37:15.833 --> 37:19.132
that I just haven't left room
for anybody else in my life.

37:23.307 --> 37:24.274
Thanks.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.400
Okay.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.136
Come on, Sugar.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.963
You said
that you had evidence

37:57.074 --> 37:59.167
of Gastner's
criminal activities.

37:59.510 --> 38:02.035
Well, why won't you tell us
about them now?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.941
You're safe here.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.143
We're never safe.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.580
He would kill me
just like he killed Celso.

38:10.721 --> 38:11.915
Celso?

38:13.758 --> 38:15.623
A man from Guadeloupe.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.453
They told me he was drunk.

38:19.030 --> 38:23.023
They put his body in the car,
and they put the car...

38:27.405 --> 38:29.839
Alfredo, why did
Gastner kill him?

38:31.275 --> 38:34.972
Alfredo, this Foundation exists
to help anyone who needs it,

38:35.246 --> 38:38.272
anyone who feels
that a wrong must be righted.

38:38.949 --> 38:41.349
You know that.
We'll protect you.

38:55.266 --> 38:58.963
Gastner brings people in across
the border to work for him.

38:59.804 --> 39:03.171
He gives us money that we
must pay back with interest.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.042
The more we make,
the more we owe.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.775
Celso refused to pay.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.811
He threatened
to go to the police.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.880
He was proud.
He was too proud.

39:15.319 --> 39:18.311
The evidence you have on
Gastner, where is it now?

39:18.389 --> 39:20.050
I have it hidden.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.152
But now I'll get it for you.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.725
Hello?

39:29.333 --> 39:30.425
Yes?

39:31.569 --> 39:33.469
What? Where?

39:35.139 --> 39:36.766
Yes, I understand.

39:37.942 --> 39:39.466
Thanks for calling.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.116
Dudley and Mel were formally
charged with attempted assault.

39:46.283 --> 39:49.946
Bail was set and Gastner posted
it before the ink was dry.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.919
Julie!

39:59.430 --> 40:01.125
What is it, Sugar?

40:04.568 --> 40:05.762
What is it?

40:06.036 --> 40:07.162
Michael?

40:33.364 --> 40:34.558
Julie.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.102
It's okay, Sugar.
I'll bring her back.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.825
You idiot. Some eyewitness.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.896
She was driving the car.
We saw her plain as day.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.454
Her boyfriend
doesn't know anything,

41:07.531 --> 41:09.260
or the cops would've
got to us by now.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.925
But who knows
what Alfredo gave them?

41:11.035 --> 41:13.970
That's why I'm clearing out,
and taking her as insurance.

41:14.038 --> 41:16.131
The guy in the black car,
he's headed this way!

41:23.080 --> 41:25.344
Julie, are you all right?

41:28.686 --> 41:30.085
He's not armed.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.985
Give it up, Gastner.
It's all over.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.853
Because of some
flimsy evidence

41:33.924 --> 41:35.585
and the word of
an illegal alien?

41:35.659 --> 41:37.786
Michael, I scanned the cars
as you asked.

41:37.862 --> 41:41.764
I've located human remains in
one of the compacted automobiles.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.060
Who said that?

41:43.133 --> 41:45.124
Celso Moreno died
in that crusher.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.207
He was murdered by Gastner and
his men because he fought back.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.402
Shut Knight up.

41:55.045 --> 41:56.945
Get him in the car.

41:57.548 --> 41:58.537
Mel.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.878
I'm going to stop
by the office

42:00.985 --> 42:02.009
and pick up the files.

42:02.052 --> 42:03.849
You take care of him.

42:04.388 --> 42:05.412
All right. Get him in.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.668
You guys stay cool,
or you're next.

42:22.907 --> 42:25.137
Michael? Michael, I need you!

42:25.209 --> 42:27.006
Michael. Michael.

43:18.329 --> 43:19.387
What are you-

43:19.463 --> 43:20.987
Hey, back off!

43:39.116 --> 43:41.141
It's okay.
I'm your friend.

43:59.203 --> 44:01.262
Michael,
you've regained consciousness.

44:01.372 --> 44:02.430
KITT, where are we?

44:02.539 --> 44:04.097
Inside the compactor.

44:04.208 --> 44:06.301
My worst nightmares
are being realized.

44:06.377 --> 44:07.708
I can see me now.

44:07.778 --> 44:10.713
Tin cans, TV dinners,
garbage can lids.

44:10.781 --> 44:12.043
Not if I can help it!

44:12.116 --> 44:14.778
Give me every pound
of Turbo Boost you've got.

44:21.091 --> 44:23.525
All right, let's go for it!
Now!

44:39.109 --> 44:40.201
You okay?

44:40.277 --> 44:42.268
At the moment,
I'm practically speechless.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.804
Gastner's about to escape,
Michael, down at the office.

44:47.418 --> 44:48.385
With Julie?

44:48.452 --> 44:49.817
No, he's alone.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.519
All right, KITT,
let's get him.

44:59.596 --> 45:01.086
Give me everything you've got.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.522
Look at that.

45:33.597 --> 45:34.689
Are you all right?

45:34.765 --> 45:35.823
I'm okay.

45:36.834 --> 45:39.462
Out cold and he never
laid a glove on me.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.437
No less than the miserable
cretin deserves, Michael.

45:42.506 --> 45:45.134
I trust a court of law will
treat him just as harshly.

45:45.209 --> 45:46.801
Count on it, buddy.

45:46.877 --> 45:49.175
Anyway, good work.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.407
Oh, yeah. Good voice.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.848
But that was my normal voice.

45:55.052 --> 45:56.781
That's what I mean.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.985
I can't believe John will be
coming home tomorrow.

46:06.063 --> 46:08.054
It seems like a miracle
how quickly he's recovering.

46:08.132 --> 46:10.191
It's always easier
when you give a man

46:10.300 --> 46:12.291
somethin' to come home for.

46:13.704 --> 46:16.639
What's going to happen with
Alfredo and the other workers?

46:16.707 --> 46:19.232
First, they've got
to testify against Gastner.

46:19.343 --> 46:21.811
With Alfredo's evidence,
that shouldn't take too long.

46:21.879 --> 46:24.347
Oh, by the way, Devon's
already looking into a way

46:24.414 --> 46:26.279
to have them stay here
and work legally.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.908
I think that's all
they really want.

46:27.985 --> 46:29.111
To work and live in peace.

46:29.186 --> 46:31.450
That doesn't seem
too much to ask for.

46:31.522 --> 46:34.116
Oh, I almost forgot.
Here. Sugar.

46:35.259 --> 46:36.385
Okay

46:37.494 --> 46:38.688
Come on, buddy.

46:38.762 --> 46:42.425
Well, when something
or someone moves me,

46:44.501 --> 46:46.662
I try and capture
his likeness.

46:47.471 --> 46:48.438
Oh.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.338
I don't know what to say.

46:51.909 --> 46:54.434
No one's ever done this
for me before.

46:59.583 --> 47:01.380
It's beautiful, Julie.

47:01.618 --> 47:05.110
And such a remarkable likeness,
don't you think, Michael?

47:05.255 --> 47:08.122
Yeah. Yeah. Very remarkable.

47:08.926 --> 47:12.157
Michael, I have one request
to ask of KITT.

47:12.229 --> 47:13.457
Name it.

47:14.097 --> 47:17.794
KITT, since I'm never going to
have another opportunity to drive-

47:17.901 --> 47:19.596
Say no more, Julie.

47:19.703 --> 47:21.330
Don't just stand there,
Michael.

47:21.438 --> 47:23.702
We're in
for the ride of our lives.

47:26.710 --> 47:28.405
Oh, you might as well
get in, too.

47:28.478 --> 47:30.139
Just mind your manners.

47:30.214 --> 47:31.374
Come on, Sugar.
