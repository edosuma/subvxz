WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:03.067
Previously on The 4400:

00:07.968 --> 00:09.934
We're not sure
what's just happened.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.767
There appears
to be something out there.

00:11.968 --> 00:12.934
The light is gone,

00:13.000 --> 00:14.734
and, and thousands of people

00:14.801 --> 00:16.534
have just suddenly appeared.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.133
Diana Skouris,
Tom Baldwin.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.000
You two will be
one ofhe teams

00:20.067 --> 00:21.367
that's responsible
for investigating

00:21.434 --> 00:22.601
what happened to the returnees.

00:22.660 --> 00:23.867
We're letting them go.

00:23.931 --> 00:25.403
SKOURIS:
We're letting them go?

00:26.036 --> 00:26.560
We don't have
a legal right to hold them.

00:26.634 --> 00:28.667
Shawn!

00:28.734 --> 00:30.801
Why disappear
a little girl from the 1940s,

00:30.868 --> 00:32.567
hold her for 60 years,

00:32.634 --> 00:33.901
and then send her back

00:34.033 --> 00:35.000
with the ability to
predict the future?

00:35.067 --> 00:36.767
What were they thinking?

00:36.834 --> 00:37.968
"They"? We don't even know
if there is a "they."

00:38.033 --> 00:39.367
Whoever sent them back,
you're saying

00:39.734 --> 00:40.901
they, they planned
for these changes to take place?

00:40.968 --> 00:43.601
You're talking about
some kind of ripple effect.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.400
I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

00:45.467 --> 00:46.033
but I was
when I got back.

00:47.868 --> 00:48.601
You haven't told your counselor

00:48.667 --> 00:50.167
about this,
have you?

00:50.234 --> 00:52.634
My foundation has an opening
in the security dertment.

00:52.767 --> 00:54.000
If you're intereed,

00:54.067 --> 00:55.367
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?

00:55.634 --> 00:56.901
I'll be there.

00:56.968 --> 00:59.501
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security refuses

00:59.567 --> 00:59.968
to divulge the names
or the whereabouts

01:02.501 --> 01:04.733
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.

01:04.801 --> 01:06.133
What you do
isn't journalism.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.801
You're getting ithe way
of my job, Barbara.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.167
Well, what are you going to do,
disappear me?

01:10.234 --> 01:11.133
About last night...

01:11.200 --> 01:13.000
The kiss?

01:13.067 --> 01:14.501
And other things.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.601
We've kind of got
a lot to talk about.

01:16.667 --> 01:19.300
I was reviewing
Kyle's EEG readout.

01:19.367 --> 01:21.000
It seems last Thursday night,
he had a momentary burst

01:21.067 --> 01:22.801
of increased
brain activity.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.501
( steady beeping )

01:25.567 --> 01:28.868
( rapid beeping )

01:28.934 --> 01:29.167
Shawn, did you do something
to him?

01:31.868 --> 01:33.834
Talk to me.

01:35.234 --> 01:37.133
How long
have I been in the dark?

01:37.200 --> 01:39.400
Kyle?

01:43.834 --> 01:46.501
So far, the test results
have been inconclusive.

01:46.567 --> 01:48.667
But there must be something
we're missing.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.734
People don't simply
regain consciousness

01:51.133 --> 01:52.934
after three years in a coma
for no reason.

01:53.000 --> 01:53.300
Honestly, we
don't care

01:54.234 --> 01:55.968
why this happened,
right, Tom?

01:56.033 --> 01:59.434
We're just glad
to have Kyle back.

01:59.501 --> 02:01.501
You've been poking
and prodding him
for more than a week.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.067
When can we
take him home?

02:03.133 --> 02:05.567
I don't see
why you can't do it now.

02:05.634 --> 02:06.901
That's wonderful.

02:06.968 --> 02:07.200
Well, there is something else.

02:10.267 --> 02:11.701
Patients like Kyle

02:11.767 --> 02:13.701
often have difficulty
adjusting to their awakenings.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.934
They do best in environments
as similar as possible

02:15.968 --> 02:17.968
to what those they were in
before their comas.

02:18.033 --> 02:18.200
In every detail.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.634
The places, the people...

02:23.701 --> 02:24.868
Hey, come on.

02:24.934 --> 02:25.200
Why are we here?

02:28.100 --> 02:31.033
We thought you'd
be happier at home.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.234
Then why take me here?

02:33.300 --> 02:36.200
Kyle, this is your home.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.934
And this is
your room, Kyle.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.133
It's just the
way you left it.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.133
Okay.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.501
Whoa, whoa,
whoawhoa.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.200
I got you.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.000 --> 03:07.634
This isn't my room.

03:07.701 --> 03:09.834
And this isn't my house.

03:12.334 --> 03:13.367
Kyle, Kyle.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.734
Kyle?

03:15.801 --> 03:17.868
Wha-what are you looking for,
buddy, huh?

03:17.934 --> 03:18.601
What are you looking for?

03:19.267 --> 03:20.234
Maybe we can help.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.868
Kyle, Kyle,
talk to us.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.734
What is he doing?

03:32.801 --> 03:33.868
Whatever it is,

03:34.267 --> 03:35.367
I say we just let him
work it out.

03:35.434 --> 03:38.167
But he doesn't recognize
the house, or his room.

03:38.300 --> 03:42.300
Linda, the doctor told us
he'd be disoriented.

03:45.334 --> 03:46.868
I'm glad you're moving back in.

03:46.934 --> 03:50.968
I'll try to stay out of your way
as much as I can.

03:51.033 --> 03:53.334
Yeah.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.200
Oh, come on, Jordan,
aren't you overreacting?

03:56.267 --> 03:57.367
No, I'm not, not at all.

03:57.434 --> 03:59.334
Publishing
the names and addresses

03:59.400 --> 04:01.701
of the 4400--
it, it's a crime, Barbara.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.968
It's a violation
of the, uh, privacy

04:04.300 --> 04:06.534
of over 4,0 people,
and whoever did it

04:06.601 --> 04:09.200
should be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

04:09.267 --> 04:10.601
So, you're saying

04:10.667 --> 04:12.834
that  warning people
that they might be living

04:12.901 --> 04:14.667
next to a public menace
is a crime?

04:14.734 --> 04:17.000
I don't think...

04:17.067 --> 04:19.233
( doorbell rings urgently )

04:19.300 --> 04:20.701
We  don't want an

04:20.767 --> 04:22.667
Shawn,
it's your uncle.

04:22.734 --> 04:24.501
Let me in.

04:29.868 --> 04:31.133
Uncle Tommy.

04:31.267 --> 04:32.634
Hey, Shawn.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.367
Come to take
the to?

04:34.434 --> 04:36.067
Quite a procession out there.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.834
Yup. They started
driving by the house

04:38.901 --> 04:42.467
the day my address and
name swed up on the net.

04:42.534 --> 04:44.400
And they haven't
stopped since.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.300
Yay for us.

04:46.367 --> 04:49.567
Well, I know
this is hard for you, Shawn.

04:49.634 --> 04:53.200
I just... I just stopped by
to say thank you.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.200
You know, we took
Kyle home yesterday,

04:55.267 --> 04:56.300
and, um, I'm grateful.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.868
He's doing good, right?

04:58.167 --> 05:02.367
Yeah. He's got a lot of work
ahead of him, but... he's awake.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.367
Aunt Linda-- does she know?

05:09.634 --> 05:10.567
About what I did, I mean?

05:10.634 --> 05:12.701
No, I figured
you wouldn't want that.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.968
Truth is, Uncle Tommy...

05:19.334 --> 05:21.734
I don't know what happened.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.567
I put my hands on him,
that's it.

05:24.634 --> 05:27.000
He woke up.

05:27.067 --> 05:27.267
He woke up,
and I don't know why.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.734
See, Shawn, this,
this thing that you can do--

05:31.901 --> 05:34.267
whatever it is,
we nd to learn more about it.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.467
Well, how? How?

05:36.534 --> 05:38.667
What, I could go
into quarantine again?

05:38.734 --> 05:40.267
They can study me some more?

05:40.334 --> 05:42.267
No, because I'm done
with all that--

05:42.334 --> 05:43.901
with the hypnosis
and the dream journals

05:43.968 --> 05:45.100
and the counseling sessions.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.367
I hear,
I hear you.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.467
But I can be an ally.

05:48.534 --> 05:49.434
Maybe I can help you.

05:57.434 --> 05:57.534
I don't think so, Uncle Tommy.

06:02.230 --> 06:03.337
That was some movie.

06:03.501 --> 06:04.333
( laughs )

06:04.406 --> 06:06.960
Biggest screen I ever saw.

06:07.033 --> 06:07.534
A-d the sound, and
all those, uh, uh...

06:11.434 --> 06:12.100
Special effects.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.200
Yes.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.868
So, did you like it?

06:15.367 --> 06:16.033
Not really.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.901
But it sure did look good.

06:17.968 --> 06:19.501
( laughing )

06:26.367 --> 06:28.133
( gasping )

06:28.367 --> 06:29.501
Down!

07:36.415 --> 07:39.168
The genie is definitely out of the bottle

07:39.418 --> 07:41.587
Three different bombings
in one day.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.841
Yeah, each targeting
the 4400s whose addresses
were made public.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.177
Wait a second.

07:52.723 --> 07:56.894
Pipe bomb,
tripwire trigger.

07:56.900 --> 07:57.100
That's about as basic
as you can get.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.604
Amateur.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.030
Diana, I just found
part of the casing.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.205
It's beautiful.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.168
Shawn's name is on that list.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.755
I had my sister upgrade
her security system, but...

08:25.881 --> 08:28.050
Yeah, I'm worried about Maia, too.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.929
You ever think about bringing her 
back into quarantine until this
blows over?

08:33.347 --> 08:36.225
Yeah, I've thought about it.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.352
I've even talked it over
with her.She started crying.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.355
She wants to stay with me, Tom.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.526
I'm glad it's working out.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.362
Who would have thought?

08:50.781 --> 08:52.950
How's Kyle adjusting
to being back home?

08:52.951 --> 08:43.400
He's still pretty weak.

08:53.534 --> 08:57.246
His memory's a mess, but he's out
of that damn hospital.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.375
What's does his
doctor think?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.837
He's stunned, just like us.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.089
Look,  it's a miracle.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.258
I don't know any other way
of putting it.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.845
What about Shawn?

09:14.638 --> 09:16.223
What about him?

09:18.100 --> 09:20.686
Where was he...
when Kyle woke up?

09:24.690 --> 09:26.525
I have no idea.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.701
All three bombs so far
were identical

09:35.868 --> 09:37.800
in design and composition.
Pipe casings, tripwire triggers.

09:37.803 --> 09:40.288
I did a chemical analysis
of the explosive.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.417
It's homemade plastique
basically boiled down
from bleach.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.712
You get the recipe from the net.
Just like the list of victims.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.590
I'd like to get my hands on
whoever leaked those names.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.425
Come on, Tom.Who do you
think leaked them?

09:51.550 --> 09:56.430
Barbara Yates.- You're Goddamn
right it was Yates.

09:56.431 --> 09:56.719
It's just her style.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.017
Cheap, inflammatory, and
dangerously irresponsible.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.436
I'll handle Yates.

10:02.439 --> 10:07.024
Meanwhile, I want you two
to back-trace hits
on every website that
published these bomb recipes.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.151
- We'll have the results soon.
- So will I.

10:12.905 --> 10:16.033
- You own this entire complex?
- 80 homes.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
Once we have this place
off the ground,

10:18.201 --> 10:21.455
I'm planning developments
in Chicago and in Los Angeles.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.334
I intend to provide
a safe haven -

10:23.335 --> 10:25.334
for any 4400 in this country
who needs one.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.631
We're opening a little
sooner than I had planned -

10:28.632 --> 10:30.631
but the bombings
have made that necessary.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.050
You do think big,
don't you?

10:33.342 --> 10:37.304
I'm a businessman.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.182
But I've been given a second chance
to do something with my life
besides make money.

10:40.930 --> 10:43.897
Because right now,
that's just not enough.

10:47.351 --> 10:49.906
Or maybe I'm just
having a mid-life crisis.

10:49.948 --> 10:52.360
93 Tomberra Lane.
What do you think?

10:52.653 --> 10:55.531
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're all beautiful.

10:55.781 --> 10:59.076
Well, it's yours. You'll be our 1st.
official residents.

10:59.952 --> 11:05.624
Oh, we can't afford
a house right now.
- Consider it a gift.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.378
For the two of you,
and your new baby.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.810
It's a small world.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.689
You did it,
didn't you?

11:30.107 --> 11:31.942
Kyle waking up?

11:35.863 --> 11:36.989
That was you.

11:37.823 --> 11:40.284
You fixed him,
just like you fixed my hand.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.291
- Have you told Danny?
- No, and I don't want you to, either.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.418
But maybe if he knew
what you d, he'd...

11:49.419 --> 11:52.588
stop thinking of you as...

11:56.008 --> 11:57.259
monster?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.265
I've been doing some thinking...

12:05.893 --> 12:08.270
This thing between Danny and
me... 

12:10.026 --> 12:11.611
...maybe it was a mistake.
- I don't want to hear this.

12:11.633 --> 12:15.611
- It's not your fault.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.738
I mean that.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.909
Danny's sweet.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.204
I like him, but...

12:27.289 --> 12:28.457
that's all.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.043
Well, he more than likes you.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.340
I know.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.938
- Dennis Ryland?
- Yeah.

12:50.939 --> 12:52.067
How are you doing?
I'm Warren Lytell.

13:52.100 --> 12:55.067
I believe Home Sec in DC
mentioned I was coming.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.069
Oh, yeah, they warned me.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.906
Right. Well, they're
never happy.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.076
They seem to think
your department -

13:04.243 --> 13:05.662
- needs to be a little more aggressive
investigating the 4400.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.623
I'm just here to see
if I can't nudge things along.

13:09.665 --> 13:13.377
The authority to review
all 4400 case files,

13:13.544 --> 13:15.963
access to all meetings
and briefing sessions,

13:16.505 --> 13:19.967
permission to ride with field
agents at your discretion.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.500
- It's a pretty broad mandate.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.638
- Well, they're looking
at 5 murders, 3 unsolved bombings,

13:24.680 --> 13:28.267
Barbara Yates bashing us
all over the airwaves.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.981
It seems to them you could
use a little bit of help.

13:31.106 --> 13:34.568
I suppose it could look that way
from a conference room in DC.

13:34.569 --> 13:36.200
I gotta tell you, Dennis,
it looks that way -

13:36.201 --> 13:37.650
from everywhere except
this glass tower of yours.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.988
I have a thousand returnees
within 75 miles of Seattle.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.408
I've got about two dozen agents
to ride herd on all of them.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.827
- You want to help me?
- Get me some more personnel.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.414
- You want to help me?
Get DC off my back.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.836
But you're not really here to
help me, are you, Warren?

13:56.962 --> 13:58.714
No...

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
... I'm here
to clean up your mess.

14:02.511 --> 14:05.888
The hell you are. Where'd they
recruit you from? FBI? NSA?

14:05.889 --> 14:08.308
It doesn't matter
where I came from.

14:08.309 --> 14:09.500
How long you been
in public service?

14:09.501 --> 14:11.727
15, 16 years?

14:12.603 --> 14:15.982
And suddenly you got a shot..

14:16.008 --> 14:18.568
at a command of your own.

14:18.570 --> 14:21.737
Now you come and take it
from me... if you can.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.926
Kyle, what's going on?

14:44.218 --> 14:48.347
- They're lies.
- What do you mean?

14:48.639 --> 14:50.060
These pictures.
I don't belong in them.

14:50.062 --> 14:53.060
These people.
I don't know them.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.896
No, no, no,
of course you do.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.300
Look, wait,
wait, wait.

14:55.938 --> 15:01.068
Look, you at the zoo, with Grandma Fran
when you´re 8. Remember?

15:01.652 --> 15:04.530
And,this is your birthday party
when you turned 10.

15:04.780 --> 15:05.948
You remember George?

15:09.076 --> 15:12.913
- He was my friend.
- That's right.

15:14.373 --> 15:16.000
That's right. And Freddy,
you have to remember Freddy.

15:16.001 --> 15:18.544
Freddy was over here
all the time when you
were little, remember?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.672
Bugs Bunny.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.927
Exactly, the kid was crazy
about cartoons.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.500
Don't, don't.

15:25.501 --> 15:26.927
Don't touch me.

15:28.679 --> 15:32.500
I'm sorry.
I-I'm trying to help.

15:32.501 --> 15:34.854
It's not my memory.
You're my father.I recognize you -

15:35.000 --> 15:39.815
- but I don't know who you are.
- It's like you' a stranger.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.600
Kyle, look. Just look at me.
Just look at me.

15:57.601 --> 15:58.600
Just look at me.
I need... I need...

15:58.601 --> 15:59.200
Just look at me.
I need... I need help.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.300
I want to help you.
I want to.

16:01.301 --> 16:02.600
Why can't you help me?

16:02.601 --> 16:05.700
I'm trying. I'm trying.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.200
I'm trying.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.726
Yeah, the ripple effect.
What about it?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.561
Every time we stop
by the Theory Room,

16:17.603 --> 16:22.900
you and Marco are always
talking about how every case
we work, there's
a ripple effect.

16:22.901 --> 16:24.446
Yeah, every case
but the Friday Harbor murders.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.446
But what if these bombings
are that ripple?

16:27.447 --> 16:30.451
The thing we couldn't figure out
about Knox is he went

16:30.452 --> 16:34.912
from killing prostitutes
before his disappearance

16:34.913 --> 16:37.456
- What if they weren't random?
- that's interesting.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.919
Yeah, we should start
looking into Knox's victims.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.919
See if we can find out
some kind of connection there.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.758
I can't condone these bombings,
but I do understand the fear

16:45.760 --> 16:48.049
that motivates them.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.928
The easiest way to stop
these acts of violence

16:51.178 --> 16:54.473
is to put the 4400
somewhere out of harm's way,

16:54.640 --> 16:58.060
someplace safe for them
and for us.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.939
Now, I know to some of you that
may sound harsh, heartless even.

17:01.940 --> 17:05.526
And I assure you
I don't mean it to be.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.000
Just as I assure you
that there are those

17:08.200 --> 17:10.000
among the 4400
who would jump..

17:10.001 --> 17:12.532
..at the chance to find
sanctuary...
- Truck's ready to go.

17:12.657 --> 17:16.244
Won't be happy
till we torch them all.

17:16.246 --> 17:18.371
They can all burn in hell.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.666
- Hey, I was listening to that.
- I'm sick of listening to it.

17:22.376 --> 17:25.546
- She's on our side, man.
- That woman is a parasite,
all right?

17:25.671 --> 17:27.260
She doesn't give
a damn about us,

17:27.261 --> 17:29.000
or that our
sister was murdered -

17:29.001 --> 17:32.200
by one of those
4400 bastards, okay?

17:32.300 --> 17:36.600
Why don't you go unload
the fertilizer, huh?

17:36.682 --> 17:38.392
And leave the air filter on.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.269
These damn fumes are killing me.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.115
Kyle? Kyle?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Hey. Mm. Hey.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.416
It's good to
see you, man.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.255
What are you doing...

18:08.422 --> 18:10.716
what are you doing
sitting out here in the rain?

18:14.011 --> 18:15.429
What are you staring at?

18:19.433 --> 18:21.000
Listen, you're
looking pretty good.

18:21.001 --> 18:23.437
The way your folks talk,

18:24.021 --> 18:25.856
I thought you'd be
some kind of zombie.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.029
They wont't leave me alone.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.449
Asking me questions,
staring at me all the time.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.744
They're just glad
to have you back.

18:39.036 --> 18:42.164
My mom did the exact
same thing to me.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.752
My parents had you
come here, didn't they?

18:48.045 --> 18:49.755
To try to make me remember?

18:51.048 --> 18:54.343
No, Kyle. Hey...

18:54.760 --> 18:57.763
- I'm going inside.I've got reading to do.
- You've got reading to do?

18:59.056 --> 18:59.932
Kyle.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.769
Comen, man,
I just got here.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.358
Look at you.

19:12.236 --> 19:15.364
I could have bought a car in my
day for the price of this suit.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.243
- How's it going?
- Ah, we got a lot of work to do.

19:19.368 --> 19:23.330
5 families moved in today.
7 more by the end of the week.

19:23.622 --> 19:27.543
Got a half a mile
of property line to shore up.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.397
The fences are too short,
overhanging trees
along the perimeter.

19:29.398 --> 19:31.797
Along the perimeter?

19:32.673 --> 19:34.260
Well, as long
as you're on the job -

19:34.300 --> 19:36.260
I feel safe,
and so does the baby.

19:36.385 --> 19:39.221
Two happy residents.
That's a start.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.777
It has been a crazy day. No.
My assistant's out..

19:43.778 --> 19:46.600
..My phone sheet is,
it's a mile long.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.526
- Ms. Yates, Dennis Ryland would
like to speak with you.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.868
Dennis.
What a pleasant surprise.

20:03.829 --> 20:07.583
Well, this is a bit
theatrical, don't you think?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.877
- Read this.
- What is it?

20:10.711 --> 20:14.131
- It's a story. A good one.
- About the 4400?

20:14.882 --> 20:19.595
No, about a TV talking head, involved
in an automobile accident last year.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.889
A hit and run, actually.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.892
It was really ugly.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.729
The pedestrian she hit
died instantly.

20:29.438 --> 20:30.898
It was a shame.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.151
Just 40 years old,
father of three.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.738
No wonder she spent so much
money covering it up.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.037
So, you blackmailing me, Dens?

20:46.038 --> 20:48.168
I shut up about the 4400...

20:48.169 --> 20:51.168
..and this envelope goes away
in a vault somewhere?

20:51.169 --> 20:53.045
Not good enough, Barbara.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.134
What do you
want me to do?

20:57.135 --> 20:58.634
It's too late
for you to do anything.

20:59.468 --> 21:02.179
I gave you a chance
and you refused.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.937
Steve Smizik from the DA's office
wants to talk to you.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.232
He's gonna charge you with
vehicular manslaughter,

21:13.357 --> 21:14.942
among other things.

21:18.362 --> 21:20.781
Look, face it.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.786
Shutting me up is not gonna make...

21:23.787 --> 21:25.786
..the 4400 disappear from the headlines.

21:25.953 --> 21:29.081
...And eventually, they will
cost you your job.

21:29.957 --> 21:34.962
- We'll see. Good-bye, Barbara.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.650
Do you really think
this is the wisest move

21:54.651 --> 21:56.650
to make under the circumstances,
Mr. Collier?

21:56.692 --> 21:58.405
All these 4400s
in the same place?

21:58.406 --> 22:01.405
You're a hell of a target.

22:01.406 --> 22:02.132
There are always
potential dangers,

22:02.133 --> 22:03.820
but that's why I hired
the security team.

22:03.824 --> 22:06.577
Mr. Tyler, I know you're trying to
protect your family,

22:06.702 --> 22:08.581
but you have to realize, 
that by staying here...

22:08.584 --> 22:10.581
... you could be putting 
yourself in serious danger.

22:10.998 --> 22:11.999
Maybe.

22:13.876 --> 22:18.005
But you know,
I was born in 1922 in Missouri....

22:18.297 --> 22:19.808
And my skin was as black then

22:19.809 --> 22:21.008
..as it is now.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.304
So I've had to worry
about fire bombings..

22:23.305 --> 22:25.304
..and lynchings and beatings
my entire life.

22:25.596 --> 22:28.015
If there's anything
I learned, it's this:

22:29.016 --> 22:31.435
eventually, a man's
got to take a stand.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.147
I'm making mine
right here.

23:21.389 --> 23:23.951
- Maia. How'd you do today?

23:23.973 --> 23:25.790
Miss Skouris,
can we talk, please?

23:25.834 --> 23:27.674
Well, give us a sec, can you?

23:28.222 --> 23:30.602
I know I'm late again...Please
just understand.

23:30.937 --> 23:34.793
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.

23:35.054 --> 23:36.536
It's...We have to consider..

23:36.537 --> 23:38.536
..the safety
of the other students.

23:38.623 --> 23:41.908
- Has Maia been a problem?
- No, not at all. Maia's lovely.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.032
But it's the bombings.

23:44.076 --> 23:46.362
With Maia's name
on that list -

23:46.363 --> 23:48.862
we can't risk
having her here at school.I'm sorry.

23:49.685 --> 23:51.519
I understand.

23:56.003 --> 23:58.149
I'm sorry, Maia.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.645
We'll, we'll find
someplace else. I promise.

24:00.864 --> 24:03.908
- It'll be okay.
- No, it's not okay. It's wrong.

24:05.156 --> 24:06.204
No, I mean...

24:06.205 --> 24:10.904
..Someone's coming
who'll make everything better..

24:11.157 --> 24:14.327
We just have to wait
a little longer.

24:26.693 --> 24:29.347
Oh. It got too warm.

24:30.081 --> 24:33.224
Come on, let´s look pretty.

24:33.504 --> 24:36.298
Well, don't you want
to look pretty?

24:42.027 --> 24:44.298
That's better.

25:07.231 --> 25:09.522
Is that a blasting cap?

25:09.550 --> 25:12.239
It's a commercial
detonator,

25:12.401 --> 25:13.959
which means it'll be
a lot easier to trace -

25:13.960 --> 25:15.559
than a bottle of bleach.

25:15.587 --> 25:17.431
We need to send it
to the lab.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.147
We need serial numbers,
lot numbers.

25:19.148 --> 25:21.147
A purchaser
would be nice.

25:21.175 --> 25:23.187
What do you have on the victim?

25:23.970 --> 25:27.174
Uh... Mary Deneville,
27 years old.

25:27.175 --> 25:29.136
The flower shop
is her father's..

25:29.137 --> 25:30.936
..She disappeared
in 1999,

25:30.937 --> 25:33.136
..but picked up her life
right where she left off.

25:33.192 --> 25:35.064
Until today.

25:35.258 --> 25:38.100
Are the 4400
that frightening to people?

25:38.101 --> 25:42.022
I mean, are we just too close,
so we don't see it?

25:42.078 --> 25:44.313
Something like this isn't fear.

25:44.341 --> 25:46.633
This is hate, pure and simple.

25:49.844 --> 25:51.408
Baldwin.

25:53.979 --> 25:55.544
Right now?

25:58.953 --> 26:00.881
- What?
- We have to go in.

26:15.411 --> 26:16.696
Nikki?

26:18.373 --> 26:20.049
Shawn.

26:22.703 --> 26:23.502
There's something
I need to tell you.

26:23.503 --> 26:25.302
I know.

26:26.223 --> 26:29.046
I saw you and Danny
talking yesterday.

26:29.102 --> 26:32.622
I just... want
to make one thing clear.

26:34.131 --> 26:36.462
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.

26:36.463 --> 26:38.462
Okay?

26:39.748 --> 26:40.754
Okay.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.168
Did you ever feel
like you just...

26:45.252 --> 26:48.716
wanted to get away
from your life for awhile?

26:48.801 --> 26:50.210
I did that for three years.

26:50.211 --> 26:52.210
I don't recommend it.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.617
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.594
Find a quiet place...

26:57.595 --> 26:59.194
where you can pretend
that...

26:59.250 --> 27:01.206
things are simple,

27:01.765 --> 27:07.382
that nobody's angry at you,
or hurt... or sad.

27:08.556 --> 27:10.959
I know just the spot.

27:14.396 --> 27:16.743
Come on, I'll take you.

27:17.023 --> 27:19.454
Yeah?
Yeah.

27:19.455 --> 27:20.000
Ok.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.921
I've been studying
your case files...

27:24.977 --> 27:26.500
Now, you're the 1st.investigative team
that I've talked to,

27:26.501 --> 27:30.994
but it seems like you 2 are the
right place to begin.

27:30.995 --> 27:32.461
Where do you
want to start--

27:32.462 --> 27:33.761
Orson Bailey?,
Oliver Knox?

27:33.845 --> 27:35.940
How about Maia Rutledge?

27:36.416 --> 27:39.238
Age eight,
disappeared in '46.

27:41.082 --> 27:42.982
Well, what about her?

27:43.038 --> 27:45.040
Well, it says in here
that her foster parents -

27:45.041 --> 27:48.040
returned her to quarantine,
no reason given.

27:48.096 --> 27:49.980
Then there's all
these reports..

27:49.981 --> 27:50.600
..of her making
predictions--

27:50.601 --> 27:51.980
..ones that come true.

27:52.036 --> 27:53.948
Next thing you know,

27:53.948 --> 27:54.200
she's been removed
from quarantine...

27:54.201 --> 27:55.948
..by one of our
field agents.

27:55.991 --> 27:59.482
I believe it goes on to say
"for further study."

27:59.506 --> 28:02.060
But you haven't filed any
other reports, though, have you?

28:02.858 --> 28:04.843
All of this
was approved by Ryland.

28:04.844 --> 28:06.643
I, uh, I don't see
what the problem is.

28:07.818 --> 28:09.953
Next case-
Shawn Farrell, age 17 -

28:09.954 --> 28:12.953
disappeared in April of 2001.

28:13.512 --> 28:16.481
It's a little thin,
isn't it, Tom?

28:16.482 --> 28:17.982
Why don't you accuse us..

28:17.983 --> 28:19.400
of whatever it is you're going
to accuse us of.

28:19.401 --> 28:20.882
and let us get
back to work?

28:21.196 --> 28:23.387
You two are good field agents,

28:23.388 --> 28:25.387
but it was a mistake
to allow two people..

28:25.457 --> 28:27.542
with such obvious
conflicts of interest..

28:27.543 --> 28:30.242
to remain
on the 4400 investigation.

28:30.347 --> 28:31.937
This is not
a conflict of interest.

28:31.938 --> 28:33.100
It is
a unique perspective.

28:33.101 --> 28:35.237
It is a window
into these people's lives.

28:35.307 --> 28:37.045
You have a gang task force,

28:37.046 --> 28:39.045
you want people on
it who know gangs.

28:39.324 --> 28:40.795
Same thing here.

28:40.796 --> 28:42.295
We know the 4400
better than any other
agents in the country.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.795
That's why we belong
on these cases.

28:43.864 --> 28:45.100
That's a nice spin.

28:45.101 --> 28:46.799
Is this what Ryland thinks?

28:46.854 --> 28:49.565
Is that who you're
after-- Ryland?

28:50.516 --> 28:52.331
You know what's ironic?

28:52.779 --> 28:55.657
The Northwest Division
used to be a backwater.

28:56.077 --> 28:58.772
It was given to
Ryland like..

28:58.773 --> 29:00.772
a pat on the back
for a career of good service.

29:01.387 --> 29:03.669
A nice quiet place
where he could ride out..

29:03.670 --> 29:05.969
his last few years
before retirement.

29:06.025 --> 29:08.412
But his free ride ended
the night the 4400 -

29:08.413 --> 29:10.412
showed up
by that lake.

29:11.055 --> 29:12.995
Now, there's going
to be a change around here

29:12.996 --> 29:14.995
whether you like it or not.

29:15.358 --> 29:17.381
You can either be part of it -

29:17.382 --> 29:19.381
or you can get
swept aside.

29:25.333 --> 29:28.853
- Lily Moore is here to see you.
- Send her in.

29:34.442 --> 29:37.264
Lily, What can I do for you?

29:40.030 --> 29:42.815
Chilean sea bass? 
Tenderloin medallions?

29:42.816 --> 29:45.815
Lobster sushi?
- Jordan..

29:45.871 --> 29:48.090
I-I just asked
if I could use the common area

29:48.091 --> 29:50.687
for our support group meeting.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.000
I didn't mean
for you to... cater it ..

29:52.001 --> 29:53.387
like a black tie dinner.

29:53.444 --> 29:54.686
Lily, people want to eat,

29:54.687 --> 29:56.686
whether they're wearing tuxedos
or not.

29:56.739 --> 29:59.366
It's going to be
a really emotional night.

29:59.534 --> 30:02.036
I mean, these people
are like me.

30:02.037 --> 30:04.536
Their family reunions
didn't turn out as planned.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.576
It's all paid for.

30:08.728 --> 30:12.779
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a bit of a control freak?

30:12.835 --> 30:14.400
Once or twice.

30:14.456 --> 30:16.971
Or that the way
you throw money at people..

30:16.972 --> 30:19.960
might make them question
what you want in return?

30:20.701 --> 30:23.049
That sounds awfully serious.

30:23.858 --> 30:25.156
Lily, if I've done anything -

30:25.157 --> 30:27.156
to make you
uncomfortable...

30:27.184 --> 30:29.335
Oh, it's just, um...

30:29.391 --> 30:31.360
you go so far
out of your way -

30:31.361 --> 30:33.249
to make sure
I'm taken care of.

30:33.250 --> 30:36.228
You give me more
than I've thought about..

30:36.229 --> 30:40.228
or... asked for or needed.

30:43.037 --> 30:45.563
You know
I'm in love with Richard, right?

30:48.088 --> 30:50.733
Lily Moore,
you are a blunt woman,

30:50.734 --> 30:51.733
and I find that attractive,

30:51.755 --> 30:54.661
which I know was
not your intent.

30:55.399 --> 30:58.328
Look, why would I try
to break up you and Richard?

30:58.372 --> 31:01.524
One, I smart enough
to know I'd fail.

31:01.591 --> 31:04.252
Two...
I just would never do that.

31:04.853 --> 31:06.100
Lily, thanks for coming by.

31:07.269 --> 31:09.885
And I hope your support group
enjoys the lobster.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.172
Yeah, it's the William Wayne
Construction Company.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.172
That's who bought
the blasting caps.

31:17.217 --> 31:18.308
Okay, good.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.700
Check their employee list -

31:19.701 --> 31:21.308
with the names we found
from the Knox case.

31:21.353 --> 31:22.661
Yeah, I'm already onto it.

31:22.662 --> 31:24.661
I'll call you back
if I find your ripple.

31:24.796 --> 31:25.450
Thanks.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.450
How is he?

31:26.516 --> 31:28.215
You better see for yourself.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.590
What are you doing,
buddy?

31:45.506 --> 31:46.937
I'm looking.

31:50.871 --> 31:52.168
For what?

31:52.549 --> 31:53.800
For me.

32:02.685 --> 32:04.540
This is the spot?

32:04.697 --> 32:05.792
Yup. 

32:06.597 --> 32:13.527
Me and 4,399 of my closest friends
popped out of a ball of light
right about here.

32:13.906 --> 32:15.784
It's so pretty.

32:17.505 --> 32:20.389
I wonder why they
sent you back here.

32:20.433 --> 32:22.892
I mean, why not on
the White House lawn,

32:23.965 --> 32:26.670
or... in the middle
of Times Square?

32:26.804 --> 32:29.688
I don't know. Maybe they just appreciate
a good view.

32:30.537 --> 32:32.929
- You think?
- I have no idea.

32:33.355 --> 32:35.277
You're such a jerk.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.423
What, you're just
figuring that out now?

32:37.982 --> 32:39.860
Hey, let me see this.

32:40.194 --> 32:41.737
What are you doing?

32:41.781 --> 32:44.441
Doctor's follow-up.
Just...

32:45.380 --> 32:47.169
It looks good.

32:57.951 --> 33:00.879
I keep thinking
you're still 14.

33:03.917 --> 33:05.439
I'm not.

33:05.909 --> 33:07.407
I know.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.478
Tom?
I found something..

34:26.652 --> 34:28.136
What do you got?

34:28.641 --> 34:30.429
Gone.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.353
We got fertilizer..

34:33.353 --> 34:35.353
And tire tracks.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.804
They got a truck bomb.

34:41.322 --> 34:44.157
The tire prints matched up
to phone company service trucks.

34:44.192 --> 34:46.618
So, we pulled
their personnel records

34:46.659 --> 34:48.876
and found one Dean Keating.
- Keating?

34:48.922 --> 34:51.527
As in Gayle Keating, Friday Harbor
murder victim?

34:51.585 --> 34:53.076
Dean's her older brother.

34:53.121 --> 34:54.521
Not only that -

34:54.522 --> 34:56.221
Gayle's younger brother Glen
works construction,

34:56.280 --> 34:57.954
and on his last job,
the company..

34:57.955 --> 34:59.954
wound up short
two dozen blasting caps.

34:59.988 --> 35:01.567
So, one of the returnees
kills their sister -

35:01.568 --> 35:03.167
and these guys
get their revenge.

35:03.225 --> 35:05.812
Yeah, and the 4400
go from being a threat -

35:05.813 --> 35:07.203
to being
sympathetic victims.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.203
The ripple effect.

35:10.095 --> 35:11.215
All right-

35:11.216 --> 35:13.215
put out an A.P.B.
on the Keating's truck,

35:13.244 --> 35:14.578
and you better not
let that truck -

35:14.578 --> 35:16.278
get to
where it's going.

35:20.798 --> 35:23.190
Come on, come on, where are you?

35:23.219 --> 35:24.614
Mr. Tyler, we're
looking for a truck bomb...

35:24.615 --> 35:26.514
You need to be
on high alert.

35:26.573 --> 35:28.176
Understood. Thanks.

35:31.049 --> 35:33.344
We're running out of time

35:33.345 --> 35:34.808
There! truck number 85 -

35:34.810 --> 35:36.808
That vehicle's assigned
to Dean Keating,

35:36.844 --> 35:41.547
and it's headed north on...
- Aurora.Heading into Richmond Highlands.

35:41.619 --> 35:42.973
We need a list
of all the 4400s ..

35:42.974 --> 35:44.973
in Richmond Highlands.

35:45.155 --> 35:47.800
There's only one of 4400s
living in that area...

35:47.801 --> 35:49.055
It's Tom's nephew.

35:49.128 --> 35:51.242
Tom, hold up.

35:54.968 --> 35:58.584
Operations, patch me through
to that phone number again.

36:00.217 --> 36:01.941
This is the Farrell residence -

36:01.942 --> 36:02.800
We're not in -

36:02.801 --> 36:04.941
You know the drill.

36:04.970 --> 36:06.927
Susan, Shawn, Danny,
it's me again.

36:06.930 --> 36:09.927
If you can hear this,
get out of the house now!

36:09.986 --> 36:12.173
Is anyone there?

36:18.702 --> 36:22.026
There it is, the number 85.
Get us down, now!

36:31.853 --> 36:34.681
Put your hands
where I can see them! Now!

36:34.740 --> 36:36.664
Get out of the truck!
Get your hands where
we can see them!

36:43.370 --> 36:44.368
What the hell?
Shut up! Stay down!

36:44.415 --> 36:45.444
You're not Keating.

36:45.445 --> 36:46.444
Where's Dean Keating?!

36:46.491 --> 36:48.310
He didn't come
into work today.

36:48.357 --> 36:49.480
No explosives!

36:49.490 --> 36:50.480
The truck's clean, Tom.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.408
- They switched vans!
- He's not Keating! Come on! Let's go!

36:58.305 --> 37:00.358
We got the wrong van!

37:00.405 --> 37:02.597
Recheck all principal targets.

37:02.644 --> 37:04.837
Report
anything suspicious.

37:24.130 --> 37:26.026
We got a twelve-foot step van - 

37:26.027 --> 37:28.026
parked near Collier's
housing complex.

37:28.073 --> 37:29.753
No plates, new paint job.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.016
That's what
the phone company uses.

37:32.062 --> 37:33.095
Patch us through
to Collier's development -

37:33.100 --> 37:35.095
Use any line you can find.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.218
Nothing.
All the phones are dead.

37:44.146 --> 37:46.199
Code red, main gate.

37:52.778 --> 37:55.227
There they are.
Get me over there.

38:22.925 --> 38:23.952
Go!

38:26.051 --> 38:27.311
Set it! Go!

39:16.591 --> 39:17.687
Hands on your head!

39:17.921 --> 39:19.950
Hands on your head!
Down, down, down, down!

39:21.490 --> 39:23.379
On your stomach, now!

39:23.776 --> 39:25.975
You're being arrested
as a terrorist -

39:25.976 --> 39:27.975
You will be treated
as an enemy combatant.

39:28.044 --> 39:30.261
You do not have the
right to remain silent.

39:30.330 --> 39:32.616
You do not have the right
to an attorney.

39:32.747 --> 39:36.673
And whatever you say will
damn sure be used against you.

40:02.387 --> 40:03.927
Dr. Mayhew?

40:04.861 --> 40:07.147
I'm Warren Lytel
from Homeland Security.

40:07.426 --> 40:10.575
I need to ask you
a few questions about Kyle Baldwin.

40:12.309 --> 40:13.918
Tom? Tom, you have to come.
You have to come quick.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.885
Just come on.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.452
Kyle...

40:39.735 --> 40:41.718
what are you doing?

40:42.231 --> 40:44.541
I know what's wrong with me.

40:45.428 --> 40:47.364
I finally understand.

40:47.410 --> 40:48.950
What is it, Kyle?

40:49.300 --> 40:50.676
Tell me.

40:51.843 --> 40:53.965
There's only
one explanation.

40:55.178 --> 40:58.421
Why I remember everything,
but can't feel anything.

41:00.286 --> 41:03.716
Why all the people in my life
seem like strangers.

41:06.328 --> 41:08.661
They're not the strangers.

41:10.294 --> 41:12.207
I am.

41:14.444 --> 41:16.870
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
