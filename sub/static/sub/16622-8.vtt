00:00.006 --> 00:01.929
Previously on "Secrets and Lies"...

00:01.939 --> 00:03.435
- Is that yours?
- Kate's.

00:03.445 --> 00:05.440
- She has a white iPad.
- Guess she had two.

00:05.450 --> 00:07.728
- Do you have cancer?
- No.

00:07.738 --> 00:09.818
Patrick committed a
felony buying houses.

00:09.829 --> 00:12.088
- You're looking at multiple charges.
- Starting with fraud.

00:12.191 --> 00:13.590
Money laundering, tax evasion...

00:13.692 --> 00:16.388
The properties went bust!
You had... you had no assets!

00:16.398 --> 00:19.188
I had a buddy. He said he would
rent out one of the houses.

00:19.198 --> 00:21.135
Get the hell out.

00:21.145 --> 00:23.389
I'm looking for Carly! Carly.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.055
How was I supposed to tell you

00:25.065 --> 00:28.158
that your brother's
wife runs a whorehouse?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:37.795 --> 00:40.165
- Good morning.
- You have no idea.

00:40.267 --> 00:41.366
What is that?

00:41.435 --> 00:44.769
Oh, this? Nothing. It's just an
incident report from last night.

00:44.872 --> 00:47.739
Shots were fired at
8686 Mint Hill Drive.

00:47.808 --> 00:49.808
- Was it a homicide?
- No.

00:49.877 --> 00:51.776
No, somebody unloaded two in the wall.

00:51.845 --> 00:53.712
House was empty by the
time the unis arrived.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.048
- Why do we care?
- Oh, because it's a whorehouse,

00:57.117 --> 00:59.684
and the name on the title
is "Sherwood Equity Group."

00:59.753 --> 01:02.020
S.E.G. owns a whorehouse?

01:02.122 --> 01:04.022
- Mm-hmm.
- But the utilities have to be

01:04.123 --> 01:05.757
in the name of an individual.

01:05.826 --> 01:08.059
And... they are.

01:09.863 --> 01:12.400
- Patrick Warner.
- Hm.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.814
Two slugs. Maybe warning shots.

01:29.883 --> 01:33.233
- Want to run ballistics?
- Why bother? Nobody got hurt.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.988
We may have something better.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.528
What are we looking for?

02:04.518 --> 02:07.252
Carter, we got a camera here.

02:07.354 --> 02:09.920
What are the odds it's the only one?

02:11.258 --> 02:13.525
The camera transmits via Wi-Fi.

02:13.627 --> 02:15.560
Well, that explains the
booster downstairs.

02:15.662 --> 02:17.862
They were recording the customers.

02:17.965 --> 02:19.598
Can you trace the signal?

02:19.700 --> 02:21.533
Yeah.

02:21.635 --> 02:24.536
Were they recording for the ladies'
security, or to blackmail the Johns?

02:24.638 --> 02:26.363
Probably both.

02:30.410 --> 02:31.443
What do you got, Carter?

02:34.181 --> 02:37.881
An FTP server capturing multiple
images somewhere in the house.

02:55.669 --> 02:57.335
Detectives, in here.

03:03.343 --> 03:05.310
Collect the footage, please.

03:10.884 --> 03:12.397
The data-storage system

03:12.407 --> 03:14.552
is the same as the one they
used in the S.E.G. building.

03:14.621 --> 03:17.205
Right, but why would they leave it here?

03:17.215 --> 03:20.087
Because it was easier just
to swipe the decks clean.

03:20.097 --> 03:22.761
Well, that sounds just like
the Warners' M.O., doesn't it?

03:22.863 --> 03:24.095
One of them.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.540
Fraud, prostitution.

03:35.609 --> 03:38.332
Who knew private equity
would be this exciting?

03:38.342 --> 03:41.908
- You forgot murder.
- Okay, what do you need from me?

03:43.617 --> 03:46.084
The truth. For once.

03:46.186 --> 03:48.820
I still don't know what happened to
Kate, and S.E.G. is falling apart.

03:48.922 --> 03:50.488
I want to know everything you know

03:50.590 --> 03:52.539
and when you knew it...
Start with Carly.

03:52.549 --> 03:54.726
I met her through the
website a year ago.

03:54.828 --> 03:57.595
I liked her, you know?
She's fun, smart, low-key.

03:57.698 --> 03:59.431
I-I had a plus-one for your party.

03:59.441 --> 04:01.099
And people bring their wives,
friends, girlfriends.

04:01.201 --> 04:03.646
So why not bring your favorite hooker?

04:03.805 --> 04:06.604
I admit, in retrospect,
it was a terrible idea.

04:08.275 --> 04:09.641
Cheers.

04:11.812 --> 04:13.845
You ladies look lovely.

04:18.332 --> 04:20.885
- You need to go.
- Okay, look, I can't leave.

04:21.351 --> 04:22.733
Excuse me.

04:25.659 --> 04:27.192
What's going on?

04:27.294 --> 04:29.461
She needs to leave. Now.

04:29.563 --> 04:33.331
The hell she does. This
party's just getting started.

04:35.556 --> 04:36.735
Uh, I got to go.

04:44.443 --> 04:47.412
Carly! Hey! Carly, wait!

04:47.972 --> 04:49.853
- I have to get out of here.
- What's going on?

04:49.863 --> 04:51.116
How do you know Melanie?

04:51.126 --> 04:53.318
I didn't know her husband
worked at your firm.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.487
- I never would have come.
- Carly.

04:55.589 --> 04:58.784
She's my boss. Melanie is my boss.

05:00.973 --> 05:02.627
You're serious?

05:02.729 --> 05:04.300
Melanie's your pimp?

05:05.866 --> 05:07.699
Someone's coming.

05:07.801 --> 05:09.434
And that's when Liam walked by?

05:09.536 --> 05:11.603
Yeah, but I didn't think Melanie's job

05:11.705 --> 05:14.072
had anything to do with Kate's murder.

05:14.174 --> 05:16.074
Patrick broke into
Kate's desk that night.

05:16.176 --> 05:18.034
He was trying to get rid
of the bank statement

05:18.044 --> 05:20.812
that proved he set up an illegal
account in S.E.G.'s name.

05:20.914 --> 05:22.313
I don't like where
you're going with this.

05:22.415 --> 05:23.815
It gets worse.

05:24.477 --> 05:28.219
Melanie erased the security footage
from the night of the party.

05:28.321 --> 05:30.522
They're both trying to cover up their
tracks. What does that tell you?

05:30.624 --> 05:32.157
I am so sorry, Eric.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.159
I swear the only thing I knew
about was "madame Melanie"...

05:34.261 --> 05:37.595
Not... not the house,
the fraud, or the statement.

05:37.697 --> 05:41.966
After Cornell brought me in, I wanted
to tell you, so I went to Patrick.

05:42.068 --> 05:44.469
Look, I have been questioned
three times by one cop

05:44.571 --> 05:46.171
and beaten up twice by another.

05:46.239 --> 05:47.605
Wait, the guy with the gun is a cop?

05:47.707 --> 05:49.674
I'm not going to jail for Melanie!

05:49.776 --> 05:51.276
This is not her fault, man.

05:51.378 --> 05:53.711
Well, good luck telling that Danny
guy when he shows up at your door.

05:53.814 --> 05:55.346
Not to mention whatever
Eric's gonna say when he...

05:55.448 --> 05:56.815
Hey, no. We cannot tell Eric.

05:56.917 --> 05:59.083
There is no "we". You have to tell him.

05:59.186 --> 06:00.931
My best friend thinks I killed his wife.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.554
No, no, no, he doesn't.

06:02.656 --> 06:04.455
Look. Look, everything is gonna be fine.

06:04.558 --> 06:06.624
You just need to calm down.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.060
I can't keep saying the same thing.

06:11.531 --> 06:13.832
- Eric.
- That's when I interrupted.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.166
Where are you going?

06:15.268 --> 06:17.802
My father doesn't know about
any of this. I got to tell him.

06:17.904 --> 06:20.872
Look, you can't. Isn't he sick?
This will kill him.

06:20.974 --> 06:23.541
So what do I do, Neil? Lie?

06:25.645 --> 06:28.395
Even if my father does have cancer,

06:28.906 --> 06:30.915
it's best he hears it from me.

06:42.021 --> 06:43.421
Another camera.

06:43.431 --> 06:45.763
So whoever was recording wanted
the outside covered, too.

06:45.866 --> 06:47.265
I don't think so.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.834
That is a sleeper camera.

06:49.936 --> 06:53.946
It's motion-sensitive.
It e-mails the images via cellular.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.607
My old unit used to use them.

06:55.709 --> 06:59.544
Are you telling me vice has
this house under surveillance?

07:10.274 --> 07:11.534
Hey.

07:12.071 --> 07:13.491
Bro, what's up?

07:15.028 --> 07:16.227
You're fired.

07:16.329 --> 07:17.729
What?

07:17.797 --> 07:20.665
We will pack your personal effects
and have them brought to the house.

07:20.734 --> 07:23.067
- Hey, Eric...
- You need to go, Patrick.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.055
Does Dad know about this?

07:26.275 --> 07:29.325
I'm sorry, Mr. Warner.
I need to collect your I.D.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.355
It's done.

08:25.121 --> 08:26.964
A pre-emptive strike
is your only option.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.148
That means full transparency to
any government agency's request.

08:30.158 --> 08:31.259
Any agency?

08:31.269 --> 08:34.946
Police, IRS, SEC, possibly the FBI.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.912
Eric made two very stupid mistakes

08:36.922 --> 08:39.371
that leave S.E.G. open to prosecution.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.486
I went to the bank and confirmed
Patrick opened the account.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.556
I knew it was fraud and
didn't raise the alarm.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.777
So, Eric can't be blamed for that.

08:45.787 --> 08:46.984
He wanted to know who was behind it.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.127
So S.E.G.'s managing
director was either in on it

08:49.229 --> 08:51.264
- or tried to cover it up.
- You see how that works?

08:51.274 --> 08:53.165
That was a mistake.
I would have made the same one.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.534
Would you have gone to a whorehouse
that S.E.G. owns and started a brawl?

08:55.602 --> 08:57.636
I was trying to help a cop
find his missing daughter.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.669
Doesn't matter if you're
saving starving orphans.

09:00.679 --> 09:02.074
You went to Mint Hill.

09:02.176 --> 09:04.409
It makes it harder to claim
you had no idea what it was.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.778
Now, S.E.G. owns a brothel.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.847
A managing partner was a client.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.440
That is all the D.A. needs

09:10.450 --> 09:12.384
to connect this firm to
commercial sex trafficking.

09:12.394 --> 09:14.453
Hey, Carly's an escort, not a sex slave.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.787
Whatever we did was consensual.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.829
How do you know she even had a choice?

09:17.988 --> 09:21.603
If she was groomed, coerced,
threatened, or abused, she's a victim.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.428
You didn't ask because you didn't care.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.565
You engaged in prostitution which
was advertised on the Internet.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.468
If phones, drugs, or hotels
were used to deliver sex work,

09:29.536 --> 09:31.403
that violated interstate commerce.

09:31.472 --> 09:33.705
Money collected from illicit
trade paid mortgages

09:33.807 --> 09:35.707
on a multi-million-dollar
real-estate loan.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.276
- Textbook money laundering.
- Oh, god.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.544
If the Feds build a case,

09:39.613 --> 09:41.980
they will perp-walk each one
of you in front of the cameras

09:42.082 --> 09:45.917
- until they get what they want.
- Okay. What do they really want?

09:46.271 --> 09:49.279
The names of the call girls
and all the men who paid them.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.655
Probably some important
names on that list.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.839
Anyone who has it can
horse-trade for immunity

09:52.849 --> 09:55.293
- or a lesser sentence.
- Okay, so how do the rest of us

09:55.396 --> 09:57.458
get our "get out of jail free" card?

09:57.468 --> 09:58.772
You don't.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.866
Even if this firm survives, none
of you are getting away unscathed.

10:07.244 --> 10:10.709
8686 Mint Hill Drive.

10:11.406 --> 10:12.911
- Pete.
- Felicia.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.914
This is Detective Andrea Cornell.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.482
When you ran the Mint Hill house

10:17.584 --> 10:19.951
and it went back to S.E.G.
and Patrick Warner,

10:20.053 --> 10:21.753
you should have alerted homicide.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.255
I would have done that eventually.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.557
Well, I'd like to see the
photographs from the sleeper camera.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.794
That bun seems really painful.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.035
Murder trumps prostitution.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.365
Yeah, but your victims are already dead.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.204
Mine at least have a chance to be saved.

10:35.214 --> 10:36.768
Felicia.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.176
Do me a favor.

10:39.837 --> 10:41.440
Can't say no to that face.

10:47.627 --> 10:49.186
Thank you.

10:56.425 --> 10:58.362
These will be very helpful.

10:58.715 --> 11:00.282
The thing is, the Mint Hill camera

11:00.292 --> 11:01.813
was used for intelligence gathering,

11:01.823 --> 11:03.395
so we know who all the players are.

11:03.464 --> 11:05.430
So you didn't have a warrant?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.632
Oh, no wonder you didn't
want to share your intel.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.734
We're working on probable cause.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.270
That prostitution ring is good,
and they know what they're doing.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.390
And if there's any
footage from those decks

11:15.400 --> 11:17.700
that you pulled from that house,
then that could help my case.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.145
Well, since Ralston's already
shared that with you,

11:20.247 --> 11:21.730
you should know they were wiped clean.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.248
Yeah, but Pete said you had skills,

11:23.317 --> 11:24.783
so I'm thinking you can find it.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.885
I'm looking for a killer.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.254
Most people, even some cops...

11:29.356 --> 11:31.423
They think that prostitution
is a victimless crime.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.365
They should have been
with us on our last raid.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.661
We found two girls,
runaways, in a cellar...

11:36.730 --> 11:39.364
13 and 16, sisters.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.766
These traffickers...
they charged $50 a go.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.217
They were both pregnant.

11:45.036 --> 11:47.405
Now, Mint Hill...
It might be a nicer zip code,

11:47.508 --> 11:49.508
but when you dig down deep,

11:49.610 --> 11:52.455
these victims, they're always the same.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.613
So how can we help you?

11:55.615 --> 11:59.487
Can you spare the man-power to set
up round-the-clock surveillance?

11:59.602 --> 12:02.042
Whose shadow do we need to be?

12:06.827 --> 12:09.461
- They're scared.
- With good reason.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.717
I'll do whatever it takes
to make this right.

12:12.981 --> 12:15.967
The only thing they're
guilty of is coming to work.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.602
The government's a slow-moving leviathan

12:17.704 --> 12:19.571
that can take its time
deposing all of you.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.940
Everyone who works here may
eventually need a lawyer,

12:22.042 --> 12:23.174
and they charge by the hour.

12:23.277 --> 12:25.644
Your people could go bankrupt
defending themselves

12:25.712 --> 12:26.711
over crimes your brother committed.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.639
Is there any way I can fix this?

12:28.649 --> 12:31.856
Not unless you're willing to do
something aggressively drastic.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.387
Just tell me what I have to do.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.426
Over here. Right over there, sir.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.228
When he gets back,

12:44.238 --> 12:47.488
could you have him call
Detective Ralston in homicide?

12:48.733 --> 12:50.759
What can I help you with, Mr. Warner?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.871
Okay, bye.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.507
While conducting an internal review,

12:55.517 --> 12:57.075
we discovered a rogue employee

12:57.177 --> 12:59.644
who had circumvented
our internal procedures

12:59.713 --> 13:01.808
to commit bank fraud.

13:02.019 --> 13:05.755
I'm notifying you and
turning over those files.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.820
Well, something stinks.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.732
Sounds like a lawyer coached you.

13:18.541 --> 13:21.569
You realize this is solid
motive for Kate's murder.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.368
Why do you think I'm here?

13:25.888 --> 13:28.645
Let me know if there's
anything else you need.

13:35.036 --> 13:37.009
Who'd he throw under the bus?

13:37.019 --> 13:38.583
His brother.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.172
Hey.

14:30.489 --> 14:33.758
Thanks for meeting me.
I didn't know who else to go to.

14:33.794 --> 14:37.361
When did you find out that your
sister-in-law has a stable?

14:37.371 --> 14:40.065
- Yesterday.
- Look, you're a smart guy, Eric.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.801
How did Melanie set up a ho
crib right under your nose?

14:42.903 --> 14:45.119
I don't know,
but she did it for Patrick.

14:45.129 --> 14:47.226
Patrick was broke,
and he needed the money.

14:47.236 --> 14:49.341
Okay, you better not be
hiding anything from me,

14:49.443 --> 14:50.909
'cause your stupid idiot brother's

14:51.011 --> 14:52.878
not more important than my missing kid.

14:52.980 --> 14:55.525
If he killed my wife, yes, he is.

14:56.318 --> 14:59.845
Don't hold back information
that could help me find Rachel.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.620
Not ever.

15:14.507 --> 15:15.785
What's this?

15:20.782 --> 15:23.545
That was the best game ever, Daddy.

15:23.644 --> 15:25.343
Do you think some of the Red
Sox are crying right now?

15:25.445 --> 15:27.212
Yeah, well, we can only hope.

15:27.281 --> 15:28.413
Hey.

15:28.482 --> 15:29.881
You can't wear your hat to bed.

15:29.983 --> 15:31.049
Why not?

15:31.084 --> 15:32.517
Look, everybody knows

15:32.619 --> 15:34.386
little girls' heads only grow at night.

15:34.488 --> 15:35.536
That's not true.

15:35.546 --> 15:37.822
If you sleep in that hat and
your head grows too much,

15:37.925 --> 15:39.958
it's just gonna rip right through.

15:40.027 --> 15:41.526
But, hey, okay, it's your hat.

15:47.115 --> 15:49.768
Do you think a girl could
ever play for the Yankees?

15:49.870 --> 15:52.437
Sure. But not you.

15:52.539 --> 15:54.906
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're too pretty.

15:54.975 --> 15:57.709
I mean, all the guys would be
looking at you instead of the ball.

15:57.778 --> 15:59.813
They'll be, like, dropping pop flies,

15:59.823 --> 16:01.546
running into each other.

16:01.648 --> 16:03.239
Forget about it.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.850
Here. Let's get you... Put this up here.

16:05.919 --> 16:07.986
And you go to sleep, all right?

16:08.088 --> 16:09.487
Tuck you in.

16:09.590 --> 16:10.655
Go to sleep, okay?

16:10.757 --> 16:12.424
- Okay.
- All right.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.361
Dad, wait!

16:22.389 --> 16:24.269
I love you. Be careful.

16:24.371 --> 16:27.305
Are you crazy?
Nothing could happen to me.

16:27.315 --> 16:28.907
You got the bullet, right?

16:33.146 --> 16:34.546
Always, Dad.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.952
Well, then, we got our bases covered.

16:37.507 --> 16:39.296
I love you, too, Rach.

16:40.621 --> 16:42.721
Night-night. Go to bed.

16:48.389 --> 16:50.228
Some kid at school convinced her

16:50.238 --> 16:53.038
there's a bullet with
every cop's name on it.

16:54.401 --> 16:57.530
And she didn't sleep for a month.

16:57.653 --> 16:58.954
It was killing us.

16:59.056 --> 17:02.358
Then I got this idea.

17:02.426 --> 17:03.826
I had this made.

17:03.895 --> 17:06.127
And I told Rachel I had found my bullet

17:06.196 --> 17:08.696
and that she could hide
it from the bad guys.

17:08.799 --> 17:12.473
And she wore it every day for years.

17:13.398 --> 17:17.940
Till I found it hanging on
the mirror the day she left.

17:18.719 --> 17:21.269
Look, I know you need
to try and find Rachel,

17:21.279 --> 17:22.978
but I need your help.

17:23.898 --> 17:25.369
What do you need?

17:26.851 --> 17:28.874
A few months back,
someone tried to blackmail me.

17:28.884 --> 17:29.879
Mm-hmm.

17:29.889 --> 17:32.146
Kate wanted me to pay and track
the money back to the source,

17:32.156 --> 17:33.322
but I said no.

17:33.424 --> 17:36.604
- I figured I'd call their bluff.
- She let you think it worked

17:36.614 --> 17:38.815
and then followed through with her plan?

17:38.825 --> 17:39.962
Yeah.

17:40.031 --> 17:41.797
What we didn't know was, around then,

17:41.866 --> 17:44.700
Patrick was going underwater
with those Mint Hill houses.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.969
He would have been scrambling
for money just to stay afloat.

17:47.071 --> 17:49.177
At least until Melanie got
things up and running,

17:49.187 --> 17:51.707
but that would take some cash to do.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.345
Oh. You think that they blackmailed you.

17:56.447 --> 17:57.913
I think Patrick and Melanie

17:58.015 --> 18:00.618
are capable of just about
anything right now.

18:00.882 --> 18:02.384
Listen.

18:02.453 --> 18:06.155
The tracking software on Kate's
iPad pinged a new location,

18:06.223 --> 18:09.423
which means the transponder
Kate planted on the money

18:09.718 --> 18:12.628
- is on the move.
- Well, then, follow the money.

18:12.730 --> 18:14.931
I can't. I need the access code.

18:15.239 --> 18:17.132
Oh, you need an encryption key.

18:17.201 --> 18:19.237
All right. I got a guy in cyber crime.

18:19.247 --> 18:22.597
He can download something for
me that'll open it. Gimme.

18:23.738 --> 18:25.226
Let's go.

18:25.236 --> 18:26.867
All right?

18:37.529 --> 18:39.021
Hi, Ma.

18:43.828 --> 18:45.494
I know it's been a while.

18:45.596 --> 18:47.863
I should've come to
visit you more often.

18:47.965 --> 18:51.533
But this... this place creeps me out.

19:09.346 --> 19:10.719
I screwed up, Ma.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.995
I wanted Dad to see that I was smart.

19:20.097 --> 19:22.431
And... I wanted his respect.

19:28.706 --> 19:31.473
I tried to make it right, but...

19:33.992 --> 19:37.713
It's not supposed to
end up like this, Mama.

19:37.815 --> 19:39.314
It's not.

19:47.091 --> 19:49.825
Patrick Warner, you're under arrest.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.124
You have the right to remain silent.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.543
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

20:07.645 --> 20:08.911
in a court of law.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.567
I'm not answering any of your questions.

21:15.656 --> 21:17.210
Oh, I'm not asking any.

21:17.220 --> 21:20.046
I have all the information I
need to convict you of murder.

21:21.190 --> 21:23.115
Even your brother thinks you're guilty.

21:23.218 --> 21:24.350
Right.

21:24.419 --> 21:27.166
Who do you think gave me
the evidence against you?

21:27.176 --> 21:28.654
Hmm?

21:28.723 --> 21:30.957
Your brother thinks you
murdered his wife.

21:31.025 --> 21:32.068
He's angry and hurt.

21:32.078 --> 21:34.742
He's your flesh and blood.
What did you expect him to do?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.257
Is my lawyer here?

21:37.799 --> 21:40.205
I'm not here to judge you, Patrick.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.949
I just want to find out the facts,
wherever they lead.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.184
This is ridiculous.

21:45.253 --> 21:48.654
- Why would I kill Kate?
- Because she knew about the fraud.

21:48.757 --> 21:52.158
- She could expose you.
- No, I didn't kill her.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.727
I did not kill Kate.

21:54.629 --> 21:56.462
What about your wife... Melanie?

21:56.531 --> 21:58.765
She's very protective of you.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.967
And Kate was a threat.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.635
Right?

22:02.737 --> 22:05.138
We're done here.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.839
I want my lawyer.

22:07.768 --> 22:10.702
I'll let you know as soon as he arrives.

22:18.290 --> 22:19.819
He invoked.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.021
His lawyer's gonna be here any minute.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.187
Then you don't have much time.

22:33.802 --> 22:36.852
Your father and sister are
waiting in your office.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.824
You got Patrick arrested?

22:49.551 --> 22:52.004
I turned the evidence against
Patrick over to the police,

22:52.014 --> 22:53.555
per instructions of counsel.

22:53.565 --> 22:55.455
You're always telling me
to listen to my lawyer.

22:55.523 --> 22:56.756
This is different!

22:56.825 --> 22:59.833
You did this with no regard for
what would happen to our brother.

22:59.843 --> 23:01.649
He killed my wife.

23:01.659 --> 23:03.029
Do you know that for sure?

23:03.097 --> 23:04.397
I will when he confesses.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.666
Oh, you can't honestly believe that.

23:06.768 --> 23:09.101
Firing Patrick was the right
thing to do for the firm,

23:09.170 --> 23:11.604
but turning him over without
even discussing it with me?

23:11.706 --> 23:13.940
You gave me this company. I run it now.

23:14.042 --> 23:15.508
I still run this family.

23:15.577 --> 23:18.173
Well, you should be really
proud of that today.

23:19.355 --> 23:20.646
Patrick had a motive.

23:20.748 --> 23:23.716
Kate knew what he was up to,
and he had the opportunity.

23:23.785 --> 23:25.885
And we all know that he was
drunk and angry that night.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.687
He would never do that.

23:27.789 --> 23:29.822
Two days ago, you would have
said the exact same thing

23:29.891 --> 23:31.023
if I accused him of fraud.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.391
- Son...
- But today... today...

23:32.494 --> 23:35.127
You know that Patrick
betrayed this company.

23:35.230 --> 23:36.429
He put everyone here at risk.

23:36.531 --> 23:38.531
He is capable of more than
any of us ever thought.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.032
Eric, you're not thinking straight.

23:40.134 --> 23:41.825
And you're not thinking at all.

23:42.027 --> 23:44.637
Patrick has made mistakes,
but he is not a murderer.

23:44.739 --> 23:48.441
Believe what you want.
I did what needed to be done.

23:50.406 --> 23:51.944
Like always.

24:08.796 --> 24:10.363
Your lawyer is in the building.

24:11.390 --> 24:12.331
Good.

24:12.433 --> 24:13.766
The man's a heavy hitter.

24:13.835 --> 24:17.402
He gets 50 grand retainer
just to pick up the phone.

24:17.869 --> 24:20.706
The thing is,
you and your wife are broke.

24:20.808 --> 24:22.708
Your collective assets were frozen

24:22.810 --> 24:24.310
minutes after your arrest.

24:24.412 --> 24:25.845
What's your point?

24:25.947 --> 24:29.882
A little kid asks an old
man on a New York street,

24:29.984 --> 24:32.118
"how do you get to Carnegie Hall?"

24:32.186 --> 24:37.223
And the old man smiles and says,
"practice, my boy.

24:37.325 --> 24:38.925
Practice."

24:40.993 --> 24:44.697
10 years ago, your wife worked
at a service in Charleston.

24:45.898 --> 24:47.552
That's a lie.

24:47.649 --> 24:49.135
Use your head, Patrick.

24:49.203 --> 24:53.406
You don't just wake up one day
and decide to run a whorehouse.

24:53.474 --> 24:57.777
You learn the trade first,
from the bottom to the top.

24:57.879 --> 25:00.850
That's a lie. You...
you photoshopped that.

25:02.086 --> 25:05.685
Here's your lawyer two weeks ago
walking into Mint Hill whorehouse.

25:06.821 --> 25:10.590
Okay, I see what you're trying to do,

25:10.692 --> 25:12.639
and it's not gonna work.

25:14.662 --> 25:17.430
And there's Melanie
going to lunch with him.

25:17.498 --> 25:19.432
Yeah, well, he's my lawyer.
Why wouldn't she?

25:19.500 --> 25:21.268
Oh, she can't afford him.

25:21.612 --> 25:24.804
But maybe she had lunch to
work out a payment plan

25:26.099 --> 25:29.742
and... got a room at the Ritz

25:29.844 --> 25:32.345
to work out the first installment.

25:34.582 --> 25:38.818
Maybe it won't take Melanie
that long to pay for 50 grand.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.352
What do you think?

25:53.735 --> 25:58.735
Mr. Warner invoked his rights,
so the interrogation stops now.

26:02.123 --> 26:04.510
Don't worry, Patrick.
I'm working closely with your wife

26:04.612 --> 26:06.846
to get you out of this.

26:16.730 --> 26:18.210
Take it easy.

26:26.701 --> 26:28.968
Come on.

26:36.488 --> 26:38.291
Now let's go ahead into table position.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.430
Oh, yeah.

26:41.532 --> 26:42.632
Inhale.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.066
I love that.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.902
Go ahead and tighten that core.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.638
Really open your chakras up.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.440
Yes. Perfect.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.243
Now let's move into downward dog.

26:54.345 --> 26:58.113
Go ahead and dig those
feet into that mat.

27:00.012 --> 27:02.636
You might want to
stay in down dog, Melanie.

27:02.646 --> 27:05.102
On your stomach, hands behind your back.

27:11.878 --> 27:14.997
Melanie Warner, you're under arrest.

27:17.852 --> 27:20.902
Maybe you can make use of
that retainer after all.

27:22.631 --> 27:24.146
Namaste.

27:39.365 --> 27:41.092
Shut the door.

27:47.054 --> 27:49.721
I went to visit your
brother this morning.

27:50.026 --> 27:51.523
Did you clear that with Stratman?

27:51.625 --> 27:54.459
Damn it, Eric. I don't need
permission to go see my own son.

27:54.968 --> 27:57.629
I wanted Patrick to know
that no matter what,

27:57.731 --> 27:59.391
his family still loves him

27:59.401 --> 28:02.300
and cares about what happens to him.

28:03.554 --> 28:05.104
He refused to see me.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.225
Patrick's sitting in a jail cell,

28:08.327 --> 28:10.460
alone and terrified, right now.

28:10.496 --> 28:12.763
I'm sure you remember
what that feels like.

28:12.831 --> 28:14.398
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

28:14.466 --> 28:16.433
Patrick thinks we've
turned our backs on him.

28:16.443 --> 28:18.168
He turned his back on us.

28:18.178 --> 28:19.936
After what he's done,
he's lucky that's all I'm doing.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.405
He would never hurt Kate.

28:21.473 --> 28:24.423
You think you know what
he would and wouldn't do

28:24.507 --> 28:26.877
- because he's your son.
- He's made mistakes,

28:26.979 --> 28:29.479
but if he's guilty of anything,
it's poor judgment.

28:29.581 --> 28:31.378
What about blackmail?

28:32.117 --> 28:33.668
What are you talking about?

28:37.055 --> 28:38.455
Right around the time

28:38.524 --> 28:41.024
Patrick's first loan payment was due,

28:41.093 --> 28:42.259
I received this.

28:42.327 --> 28:45.077
Kate paid the money
without even telling me.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.766
Whoa.

28:49.776 --> 28:50.834
Uh, oh.

28:50.844 --> 28:51.968
You all right?

28:54.973 --> 28:57.974
I'm fine. I just got a
little bit lightheaded.

29:04.049 --> 29:06.258
What makes you think it was Patrick?

29:06.645 --> 29:10.287
You have the only existing
copy of my juvenile record.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.331
You haven't handed it over to Cornell

29:12.341 --> 29:14.424
because you can't find it, right?

29:14.493 --> 29:16.593
Who else would have done this?

29:21.400 --> 29:22.697
Dad.

29:23.535 --> 29:27.103
These last few days have been
the hardest since Kate died.

29:27.482 --> 29:29.406
I understand Patrick is your son...

29:29.416 --> 29:32.311
No, you don't. You can't.
You don't have children.

29:32.321 --> 29:34.878
You were gone making money.

29:34.980 --> 29:36.546
I raised him. I raised him.

29:36.615 --> 29:39.165
I packed his lunch. I got him to school.

29:39.551 --> 29:41.151
I protected him!

29:42.521 --> 29:43.956
Mandy?

29:44.308 --> 29:45.744
Patrick?

29:55.367 --> 29:56.933
Why are you two hiding in my closet?

29:57.002 --> 29:58.702
Dad left again.

29:58.804 --> 30:00.301
Come here.

30:04.379 --> 30:06.943
Dad had a meeting.
He'll be back tomorrow.

30:08.580 --> 30:11.515
As long as I'm around,
you'll never be alone.

30:11.583 --> 30:14.384
We're a team, okay?

30:14.486 --> 30:15.876
All right.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.321
We're gonna be all right.

30:19.599 --> 30:22.626
I was more of a father to
him than you ever were!

30:22.728 --> 30:23.727
No. No.

30:23.829 --> 30:25.829
No, you see, if that were true,

30:25.898 --> 30:28.598
you would know that
you don't stop caring

30:28.700 --> 30:29.833
no matter what.

30:29.843 --> 30:31.560
You expect me to forgive him
even if he killed my wife?

30:31.570 --> 30:33.203
You can be enraged. You can hate him.

30:33.272 --> 30:36.572
You can be disappointed,
but you can't stop loving him.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.115
Ever.

31:11.777 --> 31:13.577
I didn't kill your wife.

31:13.645 --> 31:15.324
But I can tell you don't believe me.

31:15.334 --> 31:18.114
Why should I? You lied
to me about everything else.

31:18.216 --> 31:21.051
Then what do you want, Eric?

31:21.777 --> 31:23.687
I told Dad

31:23.755 --> 31:27.524
that I was more of a
father to you than he was,

31:27.593 --> 31:28.916
so I'm here to look you in the eye

31:28.926 --> 31:30.727
and see if there's
anything worth saving.

31:33.765 --> 31:36.090
You know, I know that
I'm a disappointment.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.167
I suppose, in some ways,

31:37.269 --> 31:40.167
my whole life has just been
a dress rehearsal for this.

31:41.939 --> 31:43.694
But you know what's funny?

31:44.161 --> 31:46.176
As I realized while I
was sitting in my cell

31:46.244 --> 31:49.489
that it wasn't Dad's
approval that I wanted.

31:49.499 --> 31:50.580
It was yours.

31:50.649 --> 31:52.503
Yeah, and it hurts to see
you like this, Patrick.

31:52.513 --> 31:54.718
Yeah, well, you put me here, brother.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.486
No, I gave you up.

31:56.588 --> 31:59.307
I didn't put you here.
Your actions did that.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.221
We still may face federal prosecution.

32:01.231 --> 32:03.126
We'll be paying legal
fees for the next decade,

32:03.195 --> 32:06.521
and if word gets out,
no one will do business with us.

32:06.531 --> 32:09.432
- Is that funny to you?
- No.

32:09.534 --> 32:11.116
No.

32:12.204 --> 32:13.803
It's just... You'll figure it out.

32:13.872 --> 32:15.639
You always do.

32:15.741 --> 32:17.907
So you just don't care. Is that it?

32:17.976 --> 32:21.111
I'm going to prison, Eric.

32:21.179 --> 32:23.842
And the only thing that's
worse than that is death.

32:23.957 --> 32:28.177
I cannot tell you how sorry
I am that Kate is gone.

32:29.721 --> 32:33.723
You know, and... for what
it's worth, you were right.

32:33.825 --> 32:36.726
- My wife is trash.
- What about you, Patrick?

32:36.828 --> 32:38.728
Do you get why you are here?

32:38.830 --> 32:44.300
Oh, I know what I did...
To you, the S.E.G. family.

32:44.403 --> 32:46.569
Do you know that I've
spent my whole life

32:46.672 --> 32:48.638
trying to fit into your world?

32:48.740 --> 32:50.774
And, you know,
the crazy thing about that

32:50.876 --> 32:52.575
is that I don't even like finance.

32:52.678 --> 32:54.544
I hate it. I always have.

32:54.646 --> 32:56.446
I... I think that it's boring.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.718
But for years,
I tried to be just like you

33:01.820 --> 33:03.787
instead of being myself.

33:03.889 --> 33:06.890
And now? Who are you now?

33:06.992 --> 33:08.625
I don't know.

33:09.228 --> 33:11.929
But I'm gonna be forced
to figure it out.

33:12.150 --> 33:13.730
Without any of you.

33:17.736 --> 33:18.968
And you know what?

33:19.071 --> 33:21.626
I am really looking forward to that.

33:44.409 --> 33:46.810
You're all out of cards, Mrs. Warner.

33:49.185 --> 33:50.768
How does that feel?

33:50.778 --> 33:53.011
Ah, I'm a little sore.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.483
Yep. Mogwai's yoga...
It's very challenging.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.152
Other than that, I'm peachy.

34:00.221 --> 34:01.787
How can you be this comfortable

34:01.856 --> 34:03.822
after doing what you did to those girls?

34:03.858 --> 34:05.721
I didn't make anyone do anything
they didn't want to do.

34:05.731 --> 34:06.725
Oh, so you're saying that

34:06.735 --> 34:09.962
if you offered them decent jobs
with the same amount of money,

34:09.972 --> 34:12.141
they would choose to work on their back?

34:12.150 --> 34:15.434
Even educated women get
screwed, detective.

34:15.817 --> 34:17.516
Might as well get paid for it.

34:17.525 --> 34:18.670
I mean, look at you.

34:18.739 --> 34:21.739
You eat crap from men
all day for pennies,

34:21.809 --> 34:23.842
trying to survive in their world.

34:23.911 --> 34:26.110
These women know how to control men.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.713
And they know how to make them feel

34:27.781 --> 34:29.947
no one is more important than they are.

34:30.016 --> 34:31.550
And they make a real living at it.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.851
Oh, I saw the photos.

34:40.127 --> 34:42.793
These the girls you got working for you?

34:45.900 --> 34:48.107
- How old are these girls?
- You even know,

34:48.117 --> 34:50.002
or are you just too busy
taking half their pay

34:50.070 --> 34:52.563
and catching Charlotte's
elite with their pants down

34:52.572 --> 34:54.449
to even care?

35:06.654 --> 35:08.453
That's a...

35:08.522 --> 35:10.756
That's a beautiful necklace.

35:10.858 --> 35:13.722
Very interesting on the outside.

35:15.044 --> 35:17.898
It's really interesting on the inside.

35:18.599 --> 35:21.700
It's incredible to me how much footage

35:21.802 --> 35:23.268
you can fit on a flash drive

35:23.337 --> 35:25.885
and just wear it around your neck.

35:25.895 --> 35:28.315
Makes sense while your girl
Carly got sprung so fast.

35:28.325 --> 35:30.484
You've got some really
important clients.

35:30.494 --> 35:31.665
Well done.

35:31.734 --> 35:34.881
Cell doors must just fly
open with footage like this.

35:34.891 --> 35:38.979
How did you... κnow the
video was in the necklace?

35:38.989 --> 35:41.809
Oh, we had a witness that told us.

35:41.877 --> 35:43.911
Your husband flipped on you.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.568
No, he would never do that.

35:57.984 --> 36:02.364
When I realized that I couldn't
sell the Μint hill properties,

36:03.404 --> 36:05.473
I called my wife.

36:06.302 --> 36:09.103
She met me at the office.

36:12.411 --> 36:15.037
This is everything my
father expects of me...

36:15.047 --> 36:17.478
- Abject failure.
- Screw him.

36:17.546 --> 36:19.235
- He knew this would happen.
- No, he didn't.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.972
And that's why he said
no from the beginning.

36:20.982 --> 36:24.069
He said no because no matter
what you pitched him,

36:24.079 --> 36:25.917
he was going to say no.

36:25.927 --> 36:29.159
Do you think every investment your dad
and brother have made has worked out?

36:29.169 --> 36:31.971
- No.
- You have to swing big

36:31.981 --> 36:33.266
to make money, okay?

36:33.335 --> 36:35.301
So losing a couple,
it's a part of the game, right?

36:35.404 --> 36:36.536
But your father...

36:36.605 --> 36:38.630
your father and your brother
would never tell you that.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.708
Why? Because when it comes to you,

36:41.810 --> 36:44.210
they want to rub your face in it.

36:44.279 --> 36:45.779
You have to stop judging yourself

36:45.847 --> 36:47.080
by their double standards.

36:47.149 --> 36:49.568
Regardless, I'm still screwed.

36:49.691 --> 36:52.519
No. You will not be.

36:54.247 --> 36:55.688
Okay?

36:58.493 --> 37:00.927
I promise.

37:00.996 --> 37:02.762
That's when it all started.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.034
That's amazing.
You're married for years,

37:08.103 --> 37:10.403
and within 24 hours of his arrest,

37:10.505 --> 37:12.705
he goes and throws you under the bus.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.008
Whatever happened to loyalty, huh?

37:15.076 --> 37:16.920
I did all of this for him.

37:21.516 --> 37:22.516
Okay.

37:25.530 --> 37:27.634
You want to just get to the point?
Is this about Kate?

37:27.644 --> 37:29.889
As you said, you liked
her and she liked you.

37:29.991 --> 37:31.090
I think so.

37:31.159 --> 37:33.693
You liked Kate,
but you love your husband.

37:33.762 --> 37:37.263
And you'd do anything to
protect him, including murder.

37:37.623 --> 37:38.998
I didn't kill Kate.

37:40.099 --> 37:41.799
You want to make a deal?

37:44.506 --> 37:46.439
I know who did.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.426
Hey, come on already.

38:06.528 --> 38:08.328
Do you want this back or not?

38:08.363 --> 38:10.296
You cracked the passcode?

38:10.398 --> 38:11.698
Yeah.

38:11.766 --> 38:13.800
You want to know what it is?

38:14.476 --> 38:16.002
What is it?

38:16.071 --> 38:17.871
- Eric.
- What?

38:17.973 --> 38:19.951
Password is Eric, moron.

38:21.610 --> 38:24.260
This whole time,
the password was my name.

38:24.621 --> 38:28.147
Yeah. But using, uh, an advanced
numeric-substitution cipher

38:28.216 --> 38:29.716
and a series five-eight encryption,

38:29.784 --> 38:32.652
so I'm not gonna give you
too much crap about it.

38:32.754 --> 38:34.521
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah.

38:34.839 --> 38:36.289
Wow.

38:36.358 --> 38:39.158
She used my name.

38:39.168 --> 38:41.124
_

38:47.258 --> 38:49.258
You look good in my apartment.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.272
You're leaving?

38:52.374 --> 38:54.908
Yeah. You can stay as long as you
want, but I have to get to work.

38:55.043 --> 38:56.743
Mm.

38:57.237 --> 38:59.479
Well, so do I.

38:59.581 --> 39:03.316
So what? You want to skip through
the doors together holding hands?

39:03.418 --> 39:05.168
Maybe not skip.

39:06.075 --> 39:08.956
We should take the day off.

39:08.966 --> 39:12.366
Both of us? Yes, good idea.
No one would figure that out.

39:13.562 --> 39:16.362
- Besides, you'd get bored of me.
- No way.

39:16.372 --> 39:18.772
There's still so much I want to know.

39:18.851 --> 39:22.135
All you need to know is...
that I love you.

39:25.259 --> 39:27.771
Yeah, yeah. I just... I just said that.

39:43.061 --> 39:44.824
I love you, too.

39:54.378 --> 39:56.569
I'll see you later, okay?

39:56.671 --> 39:58.037
Mm-hmm.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.947
_

40:36.444 --> 40:38.888
Hey, GPS tracker just went off.

40:39.294 --> 40:42.215
How can that be? Patrick and
Melanie are still in custody.

40:42.225 --> 40:43.942
I don't know. Maybe someone
else is blackmailing you.

40:43.952 --> 40:46.504
But I-it says "tracking
signal" right now.

40:50.706 --> 40:52.792
Tracking it where?

40:57.836 --> 41:01.634
Looks like the last
ping came from there.

41:01.644 --> 41:04.203
All right, man. Let's check it out.

41:05.093 --> 41:06.639
Nobody's home.

41:06.946 --> 41:09.108
- Place looks locked up.
- Yeah.

41:15.883 --> 41:18.651
Wait, here we go.
This could be your guy.

41:18.753 --> 41:22.285
Let him drive by first.
Get a good look at him.
