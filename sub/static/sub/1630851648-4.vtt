MUSIC: 'Long Tall Sally'
by Little Richard

00:09.759 --> 00:12.560
Faster. Sure, thing, Stan.
Anything you say.

00:12.599 --> 00:16.239
Whoa! You tryin' to get us all
killed?  I wanna go faster.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.480
Woo-hoo! Ow!

00:22.160 --> 00:24.839
Let the race begin.
HE CHUCKLES

00:29.440 --> 00:32.240
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

00:38.399 --> 00:42.600
Yee-hah!
HORN TOOTS

00:53.240 --> 00:55.000
LAUGHTER

01:33.599 --> 01:38.040
Quiet tonight, Larry. Looks like
you're in for an easy shift.

01:38.079 --> 01:40.680
Inspector Keating.
What you got?

01:40.719 --> 01:43.519
One for uniform.  Trespassers
down at Tanner's quarry.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.799
Bloody Yanks from the airbase. Last
time we got a call from the quarry,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.439
one of them sent their motor
over a cliff.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.879
Someone needs to go up there
and tell them what's what.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.319
Sounds like he's volunteering.

01:53.359 --> 01:56.480
DOORS CLATTER
Get off me! Let go of me!

01:56.519 --> 01:58.680
This way, madam.
Unhand me, you brute!

01:58.719 --> 01:59.760
I'll have you know,

01:59.799 --> 02:02.959
Inspector Keating is a close
personal friend of mine!

02:03.000 --> 02:05.719
Ah, there he is! Georgie!
Call off your hounds!

02:05.760 --> 02:07.680
Oh, God.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.680
MUSIC: 'Remember Me' by
Benedic Jude Lamdin and Riaan Vosloo

02:19.759 --> 02:20.960
MUSIC SWITCHES OFF

02:21.000 --> 02:23.840
Cheese flan.

02:23.879 --> 02:27.400
Oh! It smells like a backstreet
saloon in here!

02:27.439 --> 02:30.400
Be a treasure and save your nagging
for your husband, Mrs C.

02:30.439 --> 02:32.400
Did someone say cheese flan?

02:32.439 --> 02:37.879
Not for you. He's not had anything
all day.  "He" is in the room.

02:37.919 --> 02:41.000
And has everything he needs
except peace and bloody quiet!

02:41.039 --> 02:42.680
There's no need for language.

02:45.879 --> 02:50.280
He doesn't mean it.
Yes, I bloody do!

02:50.319 --> 02:53.120
When did he become so hateful?

02:53.159 --> 02:57.360
Where has my Leonard gone?
It's just the stress of the trial.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.400
PHONE RINGS

02:58.439 --> 03:00.280
Well, you can answer that.
My nerves are shot.

03:00.319 --> 03:03.039
Of course. You get off home.

03:05.199 --> 03:09.159
Vicarage?  It's Inspector Keating
requesting urgent back-up.

03:09.199 --> 03:12.360
'What's happened?'
Your step-sister's been arrested.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.159
What's she done now?  Well, she took
herself for a slap-up nosh

03:16.199 --> 03:19.680
to the George Hotel then did
a runner before the bill came.

03:19.719 --> 03:21.960
My only crime was eating alone,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.039
when I could have dined with you,
Georgie.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.840
Quick as you like.

03:31.879 --> 03:36.800
I, er, have to go out. Tamara's
got herself in a bit of bother.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.840
Well, off you pop and save the day.

03:39.879 --> 03:43.199
Leonard, I understand that
you're worried about the trial.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.159
But, please,
don't be cruel to Mrs C.

03:47.159 --> 03:49.840
I'll be as quick as I can.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.360
Any plans for this evening?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.919
Date with
a handsome insurance broker.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.159
Drinks and dinner. You?
Date with myself. Just drinks.

04:07.199 --> 04:09.680
Lots of drinks. Your mate's not so
mouthy now, is he?

04:09.719 --> 04:11.280
Oh, looks like someone
beat you to it.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.479
Wait here till we're ready
to take your statements.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.120
My men will not be complying
with civilian orders, Detective.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.319
Oh, hello.  I've got some questions
you need to answer.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.959
Not until I've spoken to the guy
in charge.  That would be me.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.399
First Lieutenant Ellis.
United States Air Force.

04:23.439 --> 04:27.399
Inspector Keating. Northumberland
Fusiliers, back in the day.

04:27.439 --> 04:31.279
Have we met before, Lieutenant?
No, sir.

04:31.319 --> 04:32.879
Sit yourself down, lads.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.800
Inspector,
I found these men trespassing.

04:35.839 --> 04:38.639
I was disciplining them when your
colleague arrived and arrested me

04:38.680 --> 04:41.240
along with the junior officers.
Sorry about that.

04:41.279 --> 04:43.480
I'll have this dealt with
as quickly as possible...

04:43.519 --> 04:46.120
Listen, it's Saturday night.
You guys are busy.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.079
I can have the Military Police
arrest these men

04:48.120 --> 04:49.319
as soon as we get back to camp.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.959
Larry, ask uniform to run the
Americans back to the airbase.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.160
Thank you. But I can
take the men in my own car.

04:54.199 --> 04:57.360
Impounded. Won't get it back
till Wednesday, now.

04:57.399 --> 04:58.800
Ah.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.199
If you could arrange that lift?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.959
First Lieutenant, eh?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.959
And they say it's policemen
who are getting younger.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.639
I see YOU'VE been in the wars.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.839
Bit of a run in with a MiG
in North Korea.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.160
I don't let it bother me.

05:15.199 --> 05:16.439
Ah, Lieutenant Ellis,

05:16.480 --> 05:19.000
may I introduce
The Reverend Will Davenport.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.720
How do you do?
Reverend.

05:20.759 --> 05:23.519
Excuse me,
I'd better see to the men.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.519
Give my regards to Colonel Wade.
Inspector Keating.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.360
Colonel Wade's their Commander.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.319
Yeah, sends me a card
every Christmas.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.639
Not like you to fawn over an
American.  I'm not generally a fan.

05:36.680 --> 05:41.040
But they do have a certain
something. It's the teeth.

05:42.439 --> 05:43.800
Thought you had a hot date?

05:43.839 --> 05:47.560
I'll make them some tea
while they're waiting.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.759
Can't these Brits move any faster?!

05:49.800 --> 05:53.759
Right. Let's get your step-sister
sorted. Then we'll go for a pint.

05:56.879 --> 05:59.399
Will! I've been in torment!

05:59.439 --> 06:02.199
Then perhaps you should've paid your
supper bill?

06:02.240 --> 06:04.160
I've already explained.
It was an oversight.

06:04.199 --> 06:07.519
So, what's your excuse
for the missing tableware?

06:07.560 --> 06:11.839
A rather valuable napkin ring
went AWOL, same time as she did.

06:11.879 --> 06:13.439
SHE SCOFFS
Oh, don't be absurd.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.079
My father owns half of Norfolk.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.519
They stole it. From the Vikings.
Ah. So, the family has form.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.959
Oh, for heaven's sake,
I didn't steal the wretched thing.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.680
Then let Geordie search you
and you can be on your way.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.079
Don't worry,
it'll be over before you know it.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.360
That line might work with
your wife, Mr Keating,

06:31.399 --> 06:34.439
but you'll have to do better if
you want to have your way with me.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.439
I refuse to be searched by you.
Right! Things to do, people to see.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.839
That's it?
You're not gonna help me?

06:41.879 --> 06:45.879
I don't think I can.
You could tell HIM to let me go!

06:45.920 --> 06:47.519
Let her go.
No.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.720
Don't say I didn't try.

06:52.199 --> 06:55.439
I'm sorry,
I can't help you with this now.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.920
Hey. We've all got
embarrassing family, Will.

06:57.959 --> 07:01.519
No. It's Leonard.
Oh.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.160
How is he?
Not good.

07:04.199 --> 07:06.959
I just can't seem to find
the right thing to say.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.480
Oh!
GLASS SMASHES

07:08.519 --> 07:11.720
Obrero?!

07:11.759 --> 07:17.759
Hey! Hey! Obrero! Obrero!
Come on. Wake up wake up!

07:17.800 --> 07:21.600
Obrero! Look at me.
What the hell happened?

07:21.639 --> 07:23.560
He collapsed.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.439
Come on. Come on, Stanley.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.879
You can stop that. He's dead.

07:41.480 --> 07:47.000
O-B-R-E-R-O. Obrero.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.279
Stanley.
Mm-hm.

07:48.319 --> 07:51.879
And what was Stanley's job
on the base?

07:51.920 --> 07:54.600
Something in the kitchens.
He wasn't a something, Howie!

07:54.639 --> 07:58.160
He was a short order cook. He...
He made the best Denver sandwich.

07:59.839 --> 08:03.120
It's an omelette in a sandwich!
Everybody knows that!

08:03.160 --> 08:06.480
What is it with this country?!
All right, Bobby.

08:06.519 --> 08:10.759
Did you know Stanley well?
Yeah, I did! We had plans!

08:10.800 --> 08:13.560
Go on. We were gonna buy houses
on the same street.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.279
Me, Stan and Mikey...

08:19.879 --> 08:23.480
Mikey?
Stan's brother.

08:24.439 --> 08:27.199
Look, we've told you everything
we know.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.680
Just one more question.
Why were you at the quarry?

08:32.519 --> 08:34.639
Racing cars, sir.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.480
DOOR OPENS

08:37.519 --> 08:39.960
DOG BARKS
Who's there?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.759
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

08:45.759 --> 08:51.039
Jazz and vodka. Will was right.
You do need keeping an eye on.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.399
That man can't stop meddling!
He's worried about you. We all are.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.240
I can't imagine reading this
sort of story is helping much.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.720
HE SOBS

09:03.759 --> 09:06.919
Come here.
Don't touch me.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.440
What do you want?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.799
To see you.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.080
Well, here I am in all my glory.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.519
Drink me in and be on your way.

09:20.759 --> 09:24.960
Sorry, I'm not going anywhere.
Not with you like this.

09:28.639 --> 09:31.519
What are you thinking?
Hmm, that it's booze.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.799
Or pills?

09:36.879 --> 09:43.399
Bit of pick 'n' mix.
Overdose maybe?
Here, look.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.759
Gimme some light.

10:08.759 --> 10:10.919
There's more
in the back of his throat.

10:14.679 --> 10:17.039
If he was past
being able to swallow,

10:17.080 --> 10:21.559
he was past putting them
in his mouth. So, who did?

10:27.360 --> 10:32.120
Larry, call the pathologist.
We need him here, now. Excuse me?

10:32.159 --> 10:34.759
Might I have a bite to eat?
I'm sorry, Miss.

10:34.799 --> 10:36.519
Chef's knocked off for the night.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.519
Name?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.840
Airman Howard Bennet, sir.

10:49.879 --> 10:52.360
Airman Robert Cooper, sir.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.799
And you're an apprentice engineer?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.000
I service machines
at the laundromat.

10:57.039 --> 10:59.360
And you're a medical orderly, Bobby.

10:59.399 --> 11:01.759
You have access
to prescription medicines.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.919
Did you deal drugs to Stanley?

11:03.960 --> 11:07.039
I don't sell 'em! I... I swear it!

11:07.080 --> 11:09.519
You a regular drug user, Howie?

11:09.559 --> 11:12.399
I don't touch 'em.
You're shaking.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.159
I just watched a man die.

11:17.759 --> 11:19.919
Did Stanley use drugs?
No!

11:19.960 --> 11:24.320
No, you're confusing me. I...
Sometimes my stomach is bad.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.799
I... I take meds for the pains.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.360
So when you found yourself
in my police station,

11:29.399 --> 11:32.000
with a pocket full
of stolen pharmaceuticals,

11:32.039 --> 11:34.440
you planted them
on your legless chum

11:34.480 --> 11:37.240
and shoved a couple in his mouth
for appearance's sake.

11:37.279 --> 11:41.200
Why... why would I do that?!  So
tell the Inspector what did happen?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.720
Tell us.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.799
HE EXHALES

12:00.200 --> 12:02.039
They're not gonna talk.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.279
Brothers in arms.
You know what it's like.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.440
Pathologist can't make it
till morning.

12:15.679 --> 12:18.120
I'm not one to question
police protocol,

12:18.159 --> 12:21.519
but you sure
we should be doing this?  Nope.

12:21.559 --> 12:25.120
But as soon as the Americans catch
wind, they'll wanna take charge,

12:25.159 --> 12:26.960
and we'll never know how he died.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.440
Geordie?

12:35.240 --> 12:36.919
Self-inflicted?

12:37.919 --> 12:40.200
Maybe. But this isn't.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.120
Yeah. Pressure marks.

12:43.159 --> 12:46.320
And a scratch. Maybe from a chain?

12:46.360 --> 12:50.320
But not this one, this is smooth.
You think he was choked?

12:51.519 --> 12:54.240
Well, I reckon someone
would've noticed a strangulation

12:54.279 --> 12:55.639
in the middle of a police station.

12:55.679 --> 12:57.559
And he was definitely alive
at the quarry?

12:58.679 --> 13:01.360
Yeah, alive enough
to give Larry a mouthful.

13:01.399 --> 13:06.799
And he walked into the station?
No. His mates carried him in.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.360
He was already dead.

13:13.399 --> 13:17.320
Somewhere between the quarry and
the station Stanley was strangled.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.519
And the men topped him up
with pills,

13:19.559 --> 13:21.320
make his death look like an
overdose,

13:21.360 --> 13:23.080
and carried him into the station.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.559
If it hadn't had been for
Miss Scott's cup of tea,

13:25.600 --> 13:28.519
they might have got him back
to base to die in his bed.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.120
Lieutenant Ellis
was with the lads the whole time.

13:31.159 --> 13:33.399
Has it not occurred to you
he might've been lying?

13:33.440 --> 13:35.080
Man's a war hero.

13:39.159 --> 13:41.600
And he's played me for an idiot.

13:53.559 --> 13:56.879
O-W.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.960
I don't think
the vodka is helping.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.240
I didn't invite your opinion!

14:12.279 --> 14:15.840
I wanna help.
I don't want you here!

14:15.879 --> 14:18.919
I don't want you, full stop.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.279
That's the drink talking.
No! No, it's not!

14:25.320 --> 14:26.799
You're really ending it?

14:29.279 --> 14:31.679
Oh, you can't.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.240
We have a future...

14:33.279 --> 14:36.279
I can't even see past tonight,
never mind tomorrow!

14:36.320 --> 14:38.759
Well, we can make a plan...
No!

14:38.799 --> 14:41.360
All my life, I've hidden
what I am

14:41.399 --> 14:44.279
for fear of this, this,
this mortification!

14:44.320 --> 14:46.639
And now it is upon me!

14:46.679 --> 14:53.080
I'm gonna have to stand up in court
and be exposed as... as what I am.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.679
I am to be disgraced!

14:55.720 --> 14:59.200
And bring disgrace
to all who know me.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.360
You always give in to your shame.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.759
Yes! Because I am not
the great Daniel Marlowe!

15:03.799 --> 15:06.879
Who wouldn't know shame
if it slapped him in the face!

15:06.919 --> 15:08.840
I was married.

15:10.799 --> 15:15.440
I stood at an altar and made vows
I knew I couldn't keep!

15:15.480 --> 15:18.200
If you think I've never felt shame,

15:18.240 --> 15:20.600
then you really
don't know me at all.

15:27.399 --> 15:29.799
I'd been to the pictures
with my girlfriend.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.200
After the movie,
I dropped her home.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.559
I was heading back to base
when I saw lights up at the quarry.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.399
There was a fatality there
a while back.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.080
A young airman.
Yes. A tragic accident.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.720
And how was Stanley
when you saw him at the quarry?

15:45.759 --> 15:49.360
All I know is the men had a job
getting him into the van.

15:49.399 --> 15:52.120
I had to reach out and haul him up.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.440
So, you were inside the van,
and the men were outside?

15:56.480 --> 15:58.919
Yes.
And on the way to the station.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.320
anything untoward happen?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.559
Y'know, there might have
been some commotion

16:02.600 --> 16:04.759
while the men dealt with Stanley.

16:04.799 --> 16:09.159
Dealt with him, how?
I couldn't see. It was dark.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.519
You recognise this?
No.

16:23.039 --> 16:25.440
You don't know anyone
with the initials O-W?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.840
Sorry.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.639
Then I'm done for now.

16:38.279 --> 16:39.679
Geordie?

16:42.519 --> 16:45.960
My statement is done.
I will see you on Monday.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.600
Did you manage to cancel your date?
Yes, I did, thank you, Inspector.

16:49.639 --> 16:53.519
Well, seeing you're at a loose end,
be an angel, call the air base.

16:53.559 --> 16:56.799
Tell them we've got their
Lieutenant Ellis in the cells.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.879
I thought you wanted to keep
the military authorities at bay.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.440
I do. But I'm not sure that lad
in there's who he says he is.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.640
He said he pulled
Airman Obrero INTO the van.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.680
When entering
and departing a vehicle,

17:09.720 --> 17:13.960
a superior officer always
enters last, and leaves first.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.519
Did you actually do
your National Service?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.000
Well?

17:24.039 --> 17:29.039
Well, actually, I was...
I was exempt.

17:36.119 --> 17:38.000
Medical, was it?

17:38.039 --> 17:41.799
No. I...
I served in the Cadet Corps.

17:41.839 --> 17:46.839
At school. So, you know,
it was deemed I'd done my time.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.079
Right,
I didn't know that was possible.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.960
Er, excuse me a minute.

18:04.359 --> 18:06.160
Christ.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.640
I said I need a minute.

18:23.599 --> 18:25.839
Searched the interior
of the American vehicles.

18:25.880 --> 18:29.000
Nothing of interest. Though,
found this in the glove compartment.

18:29.039 --> 18:31.160
Record of their racing results.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.160
Going by the number of entries,

18:33.200 --> 18:35.759
they're at that quarry
eight days a week.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.480
Thank you, Larry.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.599
Geordie, I hope this isn't
going to be a problem between us.

18:54.640 --> 19:00.200
Not at all. I just didn't know
it was an option. What?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.759
To serve my country
on the school playing field

19:03.799 --> 19:05.920
instead of in a Burmese prison camp.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.119
Yep?
I called the airbase.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.680
Lieutenant Ellis is tucked up
in sick bay with a dose of the flu.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.599
Knew it! Thank you, Miss Scott.

19:19.079 --> 19:21.000
So, who's the man
in the interview room?

19:21.039 --> 19:24.960
He's nipped to the lav, sir.
What?!

19:25.000 --> 19:29.240
By himself?
Well, I thought, as he's an officer.

19:30.759 --> 19:34.079
BANGING,
GLASS SMASHES

19:34.119 --> 19:35.759
All right.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.680
So much for the war injury.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.640
Going somewhere, son?

19:51.720 --> 19:55.000
Who are you? You're not this guy,
that's for sure.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.920
Did you even serve in Korea?
Or was that a lie as well?

20:05.799 --> 20:08.279
You know impersonating
an officer is an offence.

20:08.319 --> 20:13.240
A military offence. But I'm not
required to explain to a civilian.

20:15.079 --> 20:16.480
I served.

20:18.119 --> 20:21.079
Only, in my day, it wasn't all
boozing and racing cars.

20:21.119 --> 20:25.599
It was heat and hunger.
And death.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.519
The only thing that got me through
were the men serving beside me.

20:33.559 --> 20:35.119
We'd have died for each other.

20:37.039 --> 20:38.160
And we did.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.359
Who killed Stanley?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.240
You don't talk much about the war.

20:57.359 --> 20:59.240
If you'd been there,
you'd know why.

20:59.279 --> 21:02.119
Boss, just had a call from the base.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.359
The commander's on his way.
Be here in an hour.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.519
Marvellous.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.519
Georgie.
Oh, for...

21:13.240 --> 21:16.599
This is my office, not the lounge
at the bloody Ritz. Sort it!

21:17.920 --> 21:19.759
SHE GIGGLES

21:19.799 --> 21:23.160
Is he always such a grump?
He's got a lot on his mind.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.079
And what's your excuse?

21:25.119 --> 21:28.240
Well, I've just discovered that my
new step-sister is a spoilt brat.

21:28.279 --> 21:31.000
Rude.
Ah-ha, that is rich.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.920
The way you spoke to Geordie
was embarrassing.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.920
Didn't you learn anything
at finishing school?

21:34.960 --> 21:38.359
How to land a lord
and bake a souffle.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.279
Seriously, just agree to a search
and be done with it.

21:41.319 --> 21:45.160
How's your fallen woman?
The one who needed my money.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.240
Actually, he's a man.

21:49.279 --> 21:52.519
He's facing a trial
for gross indecency.

21:52.559 --> 21:55.720
William Davenport,
you're a homosexual!

21:55.759 --> 21:56.880
No...
SHE CHORTLES

21:56.920 --> 22:00.519
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.
I'm not a homosexual.

22:00.559 --> 22:03.279
Oh. That's too bad.
They're so jolly.

22:03.319 --> 22:05.440
Well, my friend isn't.

22:05.480 --> 22:09.319
He's actually rather depressed.
Well, then, you must cheer him up!

22:09.359 --> 22:12.880
That's what I was trying to do
before I was summoned here.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.359
I'm sorry.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.519
Forgive me.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.519
Now. What's a girl got to do
to be searched around here?

22:31.559 --> 22:34.079
I'll go and fetch someone.

22:54.319 --> 22:56.279
You'll get your office back
in a moment.

22:56.319 --> 22:59.839
Miss Scott's gonna search Tamara.
Mm-hm.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.960
I thought Larry
already checked the car?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.440
Don't tell me my job, thank you.

23:16.839 --> 23:20.799
Geordie, look at this.
Not interested in cars, Will.

23:20.839 --> 23:25.039
You'll be interested in this one.
Brakes have been tampered with.

23:25.079 --> 23:28.839
One of the men was meant to die
in the race tonight.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.039
The race never happened
because our lot showed up.

23:31.079 --> 23:33.839
So, instead, the killer struck
in the back of the Black Maria?

23:39.200 --> 23:42.160
Er, I'll take this one on my own,
thanks.

23:45.559 --> 23:49.359
Show me your hands.
Know a bit about engines, do you?

23:49.400 --> 23:52.759
They don't interest me much.
But you're a mechanic?

23:52.799 --> 23:56.119
I did an aptitude test
and that's where they put me.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.240
Oh, beneath you, is it?
No, sir.

24:00.319 --> 24:03.119
But I'm the only guy
who ever got full marks

24:03.160 --> 24:06.480
in the Airman Qualification Exam and
ended up working in a laundromat.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.440
Ah, well,
that could make a man resentful.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.039
Did you resent Stanley Obrero?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.839
No, sir.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.440
Ah, did you fight him
in the back of my police van?

24:18.480 --> 24:20.680
Fighting ain't in my game plan.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.599
So, what is?

24:22.640 --> 24:25.359
Get through the day
until my veteran benefits kick in.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.759
Well, that's a lot of years
fixing twin tubs.

24:27.799 --> 24:32.319
Be worth it when I'm done and the
Air Force pays me through college.

24:32.359 --> 24:34.759
That's when my life starts.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.759
You won't see a penny of that money

24:40.799 --> 24:42.960
if you get
a dishonourable discharge.

24:45.119 --> 24:48.279
So, tell me, what happened?

24:48.319 --> 24:51.920
Hands palms down, feet well apart.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.079
Thank you. I know the routine.

24:55.119 --> 24:58.160
Yes, you look like
you've been around the block.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.960
And you, a vicar's sister.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Step-sister.

25:03.039 --> 25:07.759
Wouldn't be illegal, if that's
what you're asking?  It wasn't.

25:10.359 --> 25:12.559
Where did they dredge you up from
anyway?

25:12.599 --> 25:16.319
Is your husband a policeman?
Don't have a husband. I have a job.

25:16.359 --> 25:18.079
In this place.

25:18.119 --> 25:22.000
Oh, really? Is it very exciting?

25:22.039 --> 25:24.039
Not really.

25:24.079 --> 25:28.559
Although, earlier, I did serve
a cup of tea to a dead man.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.720
Anything?
No.

25:41.759 --> 25:44.799
Get their uniforms off them.
I want them checked for brake fluid.

25:44.839 --> 25:47.440
Sir.  You know, you're assuming
they're not talking

25:47.480 --> 25:49.279
because they're protecting
each other.

25:49.319 --> 25:50.960
But what if there's another reason?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.160
Like what?
Bullying. Intimidation.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.359
Not every group of men
is a band of brothers.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.559
D'you know what,
you should call it a night.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.200
I've got this.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.839
You think I don't understand
because I wasn't a soldier...

26:05.880 --> 26:08.440
YOU have no idea what I think!

26:09.599 --> 26:12.839
But for the avoidance of doubt,
I think you used your posh school

26:12.880 --> 26:16.480
and your privilege to buy
your way out of doing your duty.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.400
And I think you are a disgrace!

26:24.079 --> 26:27.000
You're right. I should go.

26:28.559 --> 26:33.960
Erm, it's, er,
not a catalogue of car races.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.400
Erm, the numbers aren't time scores,
they're dates.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.119
For Americans,
they put the month before the day.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.000
And the words in the middle column
are in code.

26:42.039 --> 26:43.720
It's a variation of Pig Latin.

26:43.759 --> 26:46.559
Take the first letter, put it
to the end of the word. So...

26:46.599 --> 26:51.519
Valium. Candy. Luckies.
It's a black market inventory.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.920
No sign of the napkin ring.
Lady Muck is in the clear.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.599
Thanks.
You can get off for the night.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.000
Oh, the Commander might want
a cup of tea when he arrives?

27:12.039 --> 27:14.000
Is he very handsome?

27:14.039 --> 27:16.160
And very married.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.839
With a picture-perfect family.

27:29.519 --> 27:31.839
You never talk about her.

27:37.839 --> 27:42.160
I was eight years old when I was
first punched for being a pansy.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.759
That was when I knew I would
need to find myself a wife.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.880
Took me a few years,
but I found her.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.279
And I didn't have to force myself
to like her.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.759
If anything,
it was the other way around.

27:56.039 --> 27:58.839
I chased her. I made her love me.

28:02.759 --> 28:07.200
Then came our honeymoon. The sex.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.559
I thought I'd get used to it.

28:10.599 --> 28:14.920
But after the first few months,
everything just petered out.

28:16.599 --> 28:21.359
Then she found a letter
I'd written... To a man.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.599
We separated.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.599
It didn't make the front page
of The Times,

28:26.640 --> 28:29.119
but it was a huge scandal, locally.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.839
Because, by then,
despite my apathy in the bedroom,

28:32.880 --> 28:36.440
she was... She was pregnant.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.039
You have a child?

28:39.079 --> 28:42.559
No. There was a miscarriage.

28:44.559 --> 28:46.839
People lose babies all the time.

28:48.799 --> 28:50.319
They'll never know.

28:50.359 --> 28:53.920
You can't blame yourself.
Oh, I can.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.200
And everyone else did, too.
I was cut off.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.440
I wasn't even welcome
at my mother's funeral.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.079
So, you see, I do understand shame.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.920
I'm so sorry.

29:15.279 --> 29:18.720
I can't imagine the pain
of losing a child.

29:18.759 --> 29:21.480
I wish I could take that
suffering from you.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.440
You have such vast reserves
of compassion, Leonard.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.920
If only you were able
to draw on them for yourself.

29:43.559 --> 29:47.119
I'm free!
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.440
We can go to your club.
I don't have a club.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.279
Anyway, your chariot awaits.
Ah!

29:55.319 --> 29:59.640
Daddy insists on Jacobs whatever
the hour.  Lucky Jacobs (!)

30:06.599 --> 30:10.119
I'm glad you're not a homosexual.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.680
It would be a great loss
to the ladies.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.440
Here.
Took your time.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.079
Oh, charming (!)

30:29.119 --> 30:32.720
After me dragging myself out
at all hours!  Sorry.

30:32.759 --> 30:36.960
Ah, so you should be.
I had to get Mrs Nicholls to sit.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.319
She'll be waking the kids up
to feed 'em Spangles.

30:42.680 --> 30:47.599
"Right, well. Thank you, Cathy.
You've been ever so helpful."

30:47.640 --> 30:49.759
Actually, you have.

30:49.799 --> 30:52.119
I found the right one.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.759
Oh, hello, Will. How you been?

30:57.799 --> 31:02.440
Er, not too bad, thanks.
Come for tea. Saturday?

31:03.799 --> 31:06.279
Erm. Sorry. Parish business.

31:06.319 --> 31:08.440
Oh, well, another time, then.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.319
Don't be late, you.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.319
Night, Will!
Night.

31:26.079 --> 31:28.680
I shouldn't have sounded off
like that.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.599
No, you were right to.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.079
My father made the arrangements...
I don't wanna know.

31:34.119 --> 31:36.559
I need to tell you.

31:36.599 --> 31:38.839
I was 18
and I had plans for my life

31:38.880 --> 31:42.920
that didn't include two years
square bashing in Germany.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.799
These days, I understand
a little bit more about duty.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.640
And I wish I'd done mine.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.559
And I wish I'd been honest with you
from the start.

31:52.599 --> 31:54.559
Though if I had, I...

31:54.599 --> 31:57.079
Well, I doubt
we would've become friends.

32:01.279 --> 32:05.119
You know the engraving on
the medallion? I know who O-W is.

32:10.039 --> 32:12.960
He's Orson Wade III.

32:14.079 --> 32:15.599
Colonel Wade's son.

32:23.079 --> 32:27.400
Colonel Wade. May I introduce
The Reverend Will Davenport.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.279
I hear you're in possession
of my son.

32:30.319 --> 32:33.920
He was arrested tonight while
pretending to be someone he isn't.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.160
I'm afraid Orson has problems.
But thank you for your trouble.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.880
I'll see him safely back to base.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.640
I've also got three of your
junior airmen in the station,

32:43.680 --> 32:45.559
and one of them's in a body bag.

32:46.839 --> 32:49.759
What happened?  Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

32:49.799 --> 32:51.799
But I'm afraid
your son and his friends

32:51.839 --> 32:53.680
aren't being very cooperative.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.920
I'll take it from here. I need to
arrange to have the body removed.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.160
How can I get an outside line?

32:59.200 --> 33:02.559
No, that body can't go anywhere
until I know the truth.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.799
I failed the pilot exam twice.

33:16.839 --> 33:21.200
You know putting on the uniform,
driving into town.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.880
I get to be the guy
I was meant to be.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.759
My father's son. A hero.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.519
Faking a war wound
made it more plausible.

33:30.559 --> 33:34.759
I'm sorry. I never meant
to take you for a fool.

33:34.799 --> 33:36.440
How did your chain break?

33:38.440 --> 33:39.960
I got caught up in a fight.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.400
Who with?

33:42.440 --> 33:45.759
Where's my father?
He's outside!

33:45.799 --> 33:48.880
And that's where he's staying
until YOU tell me the truth.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.680
There's drugs from the pharmacy.

33:56.279 --> 33:59.119
Cigarettes, nylons, rum.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.599
Hundreds of dollars of American
goods stolen by your pals

34:02.640 --> 34:05.640
in the course of their jobs
on the base.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.559
So, what's your part in all of this?

34:07.599 --> 34:11.960
Not getting togged up in a stolen
uniform and flogging your wares

34:12.000 --> 34:15.920
around every pub in the county?
Please, don't tell my father.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.159
So, Stanley was gonna
blow the whistle?

34:18.199 --> 34:20.199
That's why you killed him.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.440
I never killed anybody!

34:22.480 --> 34:25.679
If I ever did anything wrong,
it's because Stanley made me!

34:30.159 --> 34:32.840
How about I get you some clothes
and we go have a chat?

34:37.079 --> 34:39.760
If you're in our crowd, it's
because you don't fit nowhere else.

34:39.800 --> 34:44.480
Not fast enough,
not white enough, not smart enough.

34:44.519 --> 34:46.079
So grateful to have buddies,

34:46.119 --> 34:48.519
you don't care that you
got to do whatever Stanley says.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.880
Steal for him, race with him,
do stupid stunts

34:52.920 --> 34:54.599
just to give him a thrill.

34:54.639 --> 34:58.360
What kind of stunts?
Chicken. Race towards the cliff.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.440
First one to slam on
the brakes gets punished.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.840
You've seen the book.
Everything they ever stole.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.920
Everything I ever sold.
He had us over a barrel.

35:10.519 --> 35:13.119
Those guys can't afford
to lose their career.

35:13.159 --> 35:17.159
And... I can't afford
to lose my father.

35:17.199 --> 35:21.760
The lad who died a few months back.
Was he over a barrel as well?

35:24.199 --> 35:27.519
Stanley told him to jump his car
across the ravine.

35:27.559 --> 35:30.159
It was a suicide mission.

35:30.199 --> 35:32.639
Mikey was driving
the heaviest car in the fleet.

35:32.679 --> 35:34.199
It was never gonna fly.

35:34.239 --> 35:36.800
You know you're accusing Stanley
of murder?

35:38.280 --> 35:41.719
Stanley Obrero was the greatest
bastard that ever lived.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.920
And that's why Howie and Bobbie
killed him

35:45.960 --> 35:47.880
in the back of your police van.

35:47.920 --> 35:52.840
I tried to stop them,
but I wasn't strong enough.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.880
And that's how I bust my chain.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.119
HE SIGHS
Do we believe him?

36:11.480 --> 36:13.639
The boys have checked
out the uniforms.

36:13.679 --> 36:16.920
Stanley's is covered
in brake fluid.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.320
Fits with him being
some kind of psychopath.

36:19.360 --> 36:23.599
But at the same time...
Something stinks.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.400
Stanley's neck. The marks look
like an impression from a chain.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.559
But we only found the one chain
in the Maria,

36:36.599 --> 36:38.719
and Orson claims it was his.

36:38.760 --> 36:44.079
Mm. The initials fit.
O-W. Orson Wade.

36:44.119 --> 36:47.239
What did Orson say was the name of
the airman who drove off the cliff?

36:48.360 --> 36:50.079
Mikey.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.360
And what did Bobby say was the
name of Stanley's dead brother?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.119
It's Mikey.

37:03.159 --> 37:09.639
What if the initials aren't O-W,
but M-O?

37:09.679 --> 37:11.920
Mikey Obrero.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.719
Stanley was wearing
his dead brother's chain.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.840
His brother was the kid
who drove off the cliff.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.400
I wish you'd told me.

37:30.119 --> 37:33.280
You needed me
to be the strong one.

37:33.320 --> 37:37.960
Your knight in shining armour,
bring you to life with a kiss.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.400
And you did.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.599
Actually,
it was the other way around.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.199
After it all, I had to start again.

37:46.239 --> 37:51.960
I couldn't find a way of doing that,
until I met you.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.639
No, surely not.
Leonard, you changed everything.

37:57.679 --> 38:01.599
Quite aside from giving me
yourself, you gave me hope.

38:01.639 --> 38:05.400
A new life, a whole new family.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.360
You know,
I stand to lose... everything.

38:16.159 --> 38:19.559
But I've been so caught up
in my own fear and misery

38:19.599 --> 38:23.800
that only now it's occurring to me
that you stand to lose it all, too.

38:30.039 --> 38:32.000
It's too late for all this.

38:33.599 --> 38:37.280
But maybe we don't have
to lose each other as well?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.360
So, Orson's told us everything.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.199
The little inventory of all
your crimes and misdemeanours.

38:50.239 --> 38:51.960
How it was used to trap you

38:52.000 --> 38:55.440
in a cycle of repeat offending
and subservience.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.960
He also told us the man
controlling you was Stanley.

39:02.599 --> 39:03.960
But it's Orson.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.119
That's crazy!

39:10.000 --> 39:11.559
Tell him he's wrong!

39:19.280 --> 39:20.880
If you're the good guy in all this,

39:20.920 --> 39:23.559
why did one of your friends
try and kill you tonight?

39:23.599 --> 39:26.800
Stanley Obrero
doctored the brakes of your car.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.280
And he did it
because a few months back,

39:29.320 --> 39:34.199
you made his brother
drive over a cliff. Just for kicks.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.840
Even though
you knew it could kill him.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.760
I'll probably never understand
what is going on in here.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.559
You look at these men and you
don't see friends, or comrades.

39:46.599 --> 39:49.440
You see victims.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.199
Men with dreams,
but no means to attain them.

39:54.519 --> 39:57.719
Men who joined the military as
a stepping stone to a better life.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.159
But instead, they met you.

39:59.199 --> 40:02.519
And before they knew it,
their future was in your hands.

40:02.559 --> 40:04.519
You don't know what I am to them!

40:06.880 --> 40:09.079
Stanley had some scars.

40:09.119 --> 40:12.119
I think you might have them, too?

40:29.599 --> 40:31.360
Punishment when you disobeyed?

40:35.559 --> 40:38.119
Where are your scars, Orson?

40:41.880 --> 40:44.480
So, we've established
you're a bastard.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.840
But did you kill Stanley
in the back of that Black Maria?

40:51.559 --> 40:53.920
Stanley's revenge had been foiled.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.159
Worse, he knew we'd impounded
the doctored car,

40:57.199 --> 40:58.880
and it was only a matter of time

40:58.920 --> 41:01.280
until his murder attempt
was discovered.

41:03.519 --> 41:06.960
Why are you crying? You a girl?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.880
HE ROARS

41:09.920 --> 41:14.320
Whoa, Stanley, stop!
Stan, calm down! Stan, come on!

41:14.360 --> 41:17.519
GRUNTING

41:17.559 --> 41:19.119
Who killed Stanley?

41:30.719 --> 41:32.559
Come on, Stan.
Be careful.

41:32.599 --> 41:34.400
Easy.
That's enough.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.400
CHOKING

41:37.440 --> 41:39.679
We all good now?

41:45.800 --> 41:47.079
Stan?

41:49.360 --> 41:52.039
I didn't mean to hurt no-one.

41:52.079 --> 41:54.239
HE SOBS

41:54.280 --> 41:56.639
He was my friend.

42:14.199 --> 42:18.119
I wouldn't want to be the man who
has to knock on that mother's door.

42:18.159 --> 42:21.159
What will happen to Bobby?

42:22.679 --> 42:26.000
He'll be tried for manslaughter
in the military court.

42:26.039 --> 42:30.239
Three lives destroyed
by Orson Wade III.

42:31.519 --> 42:34.400
And Daddy'll make sure
he gets away scot-free.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.679
You know, when I was growing up,

42:38.719 --> 42:41.880
I thought my father
was master of everything.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.480
It's only when
I look back from a distance,

42:44.519 --> 42:48.840
that I saw he was just a small man
with a very limited reach.

42:50.599 --> 42:52.960
So, what you saying?

42:56.880 --> 42:58.519
Not you, son.

43:00.159 --> 43:02.599
Orson Wade, I'm charging you with
murder.

43:02.639 --> 43:04.440
Bobby killed Stanley.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.840
And you killed his brother, Mikey.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.400
Just as surely as if you'd driven
him over that cliff yourself.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.559
Inspector, I thought we agreed

43:12.599 --> 43:15.519
that this issue
would be dealt with on base.

43:15.559 --> 43:20.480
Your son's a civilian and can't
be prosecuted under military law.

43:20.519 --> 43:24.119
He'll be tried
in an English civil court,

43:24.159 --> 43:28.039
same as any other murderer in the
land. Take him back to the cells.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.920
Come on, you.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.079
Night.
Yeah. Night.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.960
Er, give my best to Leonard.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.360
Tell him to keep his chin up.
