- NO.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.050

AND IF ANY OF YOU TOUCHES ONE,

01:20.848 --> 01:22.950

02:22.310 --> 02:24.278
- WELL, NOW YOU GOTTA SAY.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.547

02:26.580 --> 02:28.282
TRYING TO RESET MY CIRCADIAN
RHYTHM FOR THE NIGHT--

02:28.316 --> 02:30.718

IT'D BE LIKE THE THRILLER VIDEO

02:32.820 --> 02:36.357
WITH A TOUCH OF SMOOTH CRIMINAL,
WHICH IS NOT THAT CRAZY

02:36.390 --> 02:39.059
BECAUSE THE SONG WAS ORIGINALLY
CALLED CHICAGO 1945.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.628
- I REMEMBER THAT VIDEO.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.962
MICHAEL JACKSON HAD
THE TOMMY GUN, RIGHT?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.063
- YEAH, HE HAD THAT COOL LEAN.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.365
YOU KNOW YOU TRIED THAT LEAN.

- DUDE, I COULD DO THAT LEAN
RIGHT NOW.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.535
- NO WAY, BRO.
HE HAD SPECIAL SHOES.

- HOW ABOUT YOU, BRIAN?
OH, HEY, WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.357
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S COMING FROM BRIAN'S BAG.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.892
BRIAN, WHAT'S RATTLING AROUND
IN YOUR BAG?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.927
both: OH!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.729
I DIDN'T PUT IT THERE.
I WAS FRAMED.

- I LIKE THAT.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.856
MY FIRST NIGHT SHIFT AND I
ALREADY HAVE A KILLER NICKNAME.

BRIAN.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.331

04:32.606 --> 04:34.308
- SHUT UP, MACKENZIE.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.409
SHE'S NOT DYING.
SHE JUST TRIPPED.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.411
DON'T BE SO EMO.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.513
- THAT SOUND SHE MADE,
IT'S THE EXACT SAME SOUND

04:39.547 --> 04:41.415
MY GRANDPA MADE
WHEN HE DIED.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.683
both: OKAY.
- CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE SHE IS?

04:42.716 --> 04:44.618
- MY MOM'S IN THE KITCHEN.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.255
TAKE A LEFT.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.091

JUST 45 MINUTES?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.593
I UNDERSTAND.
LOOK--

04:52.626 --> 04:55.162
OH, THE PARAMEDICS ARE HERE.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.435
I, UM, I'M SUCH A KLUTZ.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.471
I--I WAS CARRYING
THE KARAOKE MACHINE,

05:03.504 --> 05:06.306
AND I GUESS I JUST SLIPPED
ON SOME ICE CREAM.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.941
- ZOE.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.843
- YEAH, MA'AM, LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE A FRACTURE.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.545
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.847
- I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO WATCH THE KIDS.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.850
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT I COULD
JUST PUT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.686
- AREN'T YOU IN A LOT OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.788
- NOT NEARLY AS MUCH
AS THE LAST THREE YEARS.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.956
I'M JOKING--AH!--ISH.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.726
- WE'RE GONNA PUT AN AIR CAST
ON THIS JUST TO STABILIZE IT,

05:25.759 --> 05:28.496
BUT THEN WE GOTTA TAKE YOU IN.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.531
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, UM,

05:30.564 --> 05:33.300
I'M SORRY, GIRLS, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SLUMBER PARTY IS OVER.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.535
EVERYONE NEEDS TO CALL
THEIR PARENTS.

05:34.568 --> 05:38.372
[all protesting]

05:38.406 --> 05:40.307
- MOM, PLEASE, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.543
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER

05:42.576 --> 05:45.245
- I'M REALLY SORRY, SWEETIE.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.480
- I THOUGHT
11 WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT,

05:46.514 --> 05:48.716
BUT IT'S JUST MORE OF THE SAME.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.418
- IT'S EXACTLY LIKE
WHEN WE HAD TO GO HOME

05:50.451 --> 05:52.252
FROM JODI'S SLEEPOVER.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.222
- THAT WAS SO LAME,
IT RUINED HER.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.725
- WHO'S JODI?
- EXACTLY.

05:57.758 --> 06:02.329

A BUNCH OF LITTLE GIRLS.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.070

MOM.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.074
THEY'RE LIKE THE SAFEST PEOPLE
ON THE WHOLE PLANET

06:14.107 --> 06:15.876

06:36.263 --> 06:38.265
BRIAN, WILL YOU GET THIS
YOUNG LADY SOMETHING TO EAT?

06:38.298 --> 06:40.601
- HOPE YOU LIKE GRILLED CHEESE.
IT'S MY SPECIALTY.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.603
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THIS IS SO NICE OF YOU GUYS.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.438
- NO.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.139
THIS WOMAN'S CLEARLY ON HER OWN.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD THAT CAN BE.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.208
- YEAH, BUT WHY DO YOU
GET TO TAKE HER?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.309
- SENIORITY.
- OH, PLEASE.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.944
- REPARATIONS.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.279

TO THE AIRPORT.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.280

06:53.313 --> 06:54.982
- I GAVE YOU PIZZA AND BEER.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.650
- SINCE WHEN DID PEOPLE DECIDE
THAT PIZZA AND BEER

06:56.684 --> 06:58.118
WAS ENOUGH OF A THANK-YOU
FOR HELPING SOMEONE MOVE?

06:58.151 --> 06:59.587
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IT'S NEVER BEEN ENOUGH.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.388
COME ON, SHEILA.
LET'S GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.823

07:04.357 --> 07:08.295
AND DON'T LET THEM WATCH

OH, TO BE HONEST,
I WAS ALREADY A LITTLE EXHAUSTED

08:29.176 --> 08:32.312
- YOU KNOW, I USED TO HAVE
A TON OF GAY BEST FRIENDS.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.915
IN COLLEGE, I HAD, LIKE, THREE.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.150
AND THEN THEY ALL DROP YOU
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.752
- I BET THEY ALL SHOWED UP
TO THE WEDDING, THOUGH.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.353
- THEY WERE
IN EVERY GODDAMN PICTURE.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.723
- MM-HMM, TYPICAL.

08:42.756 --> 08:47.928
- [vocalizing]

08:47.961 --> 08:49.496
- GREAT CARTWHEEL, CAITLYN.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.665
NAILED THAT HIGH NOTE,
MACKENZIE, I'M SERIOUS.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.533
- JOHNNY!
JOHNNY, OVER HERE!

08:53.567 --> 08:55.402
- JOHNNY, LOOK HERE!
- THAT'S COOL.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.204
- JOHNNY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WATCH THE SHOW.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.872
THESE GIRLS ARE PERFORMING
THEIR HEARTS OUT FOR YOU.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.841
- SO ARE THE BLACKHAWKS.
THEY'RE UP TWO TO ONE.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.342
- CAN I BRAID YOUR HAIR?
- NO.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.677
- YOU CAN BRAID MY HAIR.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.913
- UH, JOHNNY'S HAIR
IS WAY PRETTIER.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.715
- MINE HAS MORE BODY.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.418
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, THE NEXT ACT
IN THE SHOW IS GOING TO BE...

09:11.451 --> 09:13.587
BEYONCE!

09:13.621 --> 09:15.956
- GREAT, WONDERFUL.
WHICH SONG?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.925
MAYBE A LITTLE SINGLE LADIES,
PERHAPS?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.793
- [laughing] THAT SONG CAME OUT
WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, BORN.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.261
- DRUNK IN LOVE.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.097
- YEAH, DRUNK IN LOVE,
AND I'M BEYONCE.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.899
- IT'S MY HOUSE.
I GET TO BE BEYONCE.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.035
- IT IS HER HOUSE, SUSAN.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.870
- I COULD BE BEYONCE.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.772
- OKAY, YOU CAN'T
ALWAYS BE BEYONCE

09:31.805 --> 09:32.773
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.474
THAT'S RACIST.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.276
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RACIST
BECAUSE YOU THINK

09:36.309 --> 09:38.612
I ONLY WANNA BE BEYONCE
BECAUSE I'M BLACK.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.414
- YOU'RE RACIST
BECAUSE YOU THINK I THINK THAT.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.951
- MAYBE BEYONCE'S BLACK
AND WHITE, LIKE OBAMA,

09:43.984 --> 09:45.886
SO YOU'RE BOTH RACIST!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.622
- BEYONCE IS BLACK.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.991
- JOHNNY, WHICH ONE OF US
IS RACIST?

09:51.024 --> 09:52.993
- YOU CAN--YOU CAN ALL BE RACIST
OR BEYONCE.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.427
HELL, YOU CAN BE PRESIDENT.
DREAM BIG, GIRLS.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.063
- WHOA, THEY CAN'T ALL
BE BEYONCE.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.464
I MEAN,
THERE'S ONLY ONE BEYONCE.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.599
- WELL, I HAVE
THE MOST DANCE EXPERIENCE.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.968
- TAP DOESN'T COUNT.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.904
- AGAIN, IT'S MY HOUSE
AND MY BIRTHDAY.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.572
[overlapping arguing]

10:05.605 --> 10:06.940
- BRIAN, WHAT IS GOING ON?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.575
- UM, I'M TRYING TO PUT ON
A SHOW.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.479
- YEAH, WELL, I'M GONNA WATCH
THE GAME IN THE KITCHEN.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.815
CALL ME IF SOMEBODY DRAWS BLOOD.

10:14.848 --> 10:18.819
[arguing continues]

10:18.852 --> 10:20.821
- MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
SOME BEYONCE TRYOUTS, GIRLS.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.755
all: NOT NOW!

10:21.789 --> 10:24.324
- OKAY, OKAY, SORRY.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.794
- DON'T WORRY, I'M GONNA PULL
SOME STRINGS

10:26.827 --> 10:29.329
AND GET YOU BACK HOME
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.666
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, MAYBE WE
CAN FIND YOU A NEW BEST FRIEND.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.601
A LOT OF GAY MEN
AT THIS HOSPITAL.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.602
AT ALL HOSPITALS, ACTUALLY.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.037
- YEAH, WHY IS THAT?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.973
- GREY'S ANATOMY.
HEY, CARLOS!

10:40.007 --> 10:41.341
NOW, THAT'S CARLOS,

10:41.374 --> 10:42.609
FORMER COMPETITIVE
BALLROOM DANCER.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.977
- PROMISING.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.846
- LIVES TO SHOP,
JUST AN OKAY KISSER--

10:45.879 --> 10:48.181
NOT THAT THAT'S RELEVANT TO YOU.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.718
- I JUST WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A WOMAN AGAIN,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.853
YOU KNOW?
- HMM, NO.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.354
- LIKE SOMETIMES,
I WANNA BE WHISKED AWAY.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.223
- HI, PRETTY LADY.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.791
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE MY V.I.P. TONIGHT.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.860
- [gasps]
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.462
- MM-HMM.
I GOT FAITH.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.064
[laughter]

11:04.097 --> 11:06.133
- MAKE 'EM STOP LAUGHING AT US.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.802
- OKAY, YEAH, GIRLS, THAT DOES
SOUND LIKE MEAN LAUGHTER, OKAY?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.370
- WELL, THEY'RE TATTLETALING.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.806
- THAT'S--THAT'S TRUE,
SO ONE DEMERIT FOR EACH.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.307
SO MOVING FORWARD, GIRLS.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.409
- BRIAN, MAKE THEM
SHARE THE NAIL POLISH WITH US.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.812
IT'S NOT FAIR.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.814
- I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE
MY PERSONAL NAIL POLISH

11:20.848 --> 11:22.682
WITH ANYONE IF I DON'T WANT TO--
IT'S THE LAW.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.484
- SUSAN, PLEASE.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.819
- TOO BAD BEING A BITCH
ISN'T AGAINST THE LAW.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.988
all: OOH!

11:28.021 --> 11:29.422
- NOPE, NO, NO, NO, OKAY, UH,

11:29.456 --> 11:30.824
HOW ABOUT WE PLAY
LIGHT AS A FEATHER,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.993
STIFF AS A BOARD, HUH?
RIGHT?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.428
OR WE COULD MAKE
FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.030
- DON'T BE SO LAME, BRIAN.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.666
- [sighs]

11:39.699 --> 11:41.401
JOHNNY?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.336
THEY'RE TURNING ON EACH OTHER,
JOHN.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.773
- HANG IN THERE, MAN.
IT'S TIED IN THE THIRD PERIOD.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.007
- YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION
WITH A KNIFE IN HERE, JOHN.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.410
- YOU'RE FINE!

11:50.443 --> 11:53.380
OH! NO! OH, HEY!

11:53.413 --> 11:54.848
NO, NO, NO, YOU WITH THE REMOTE,
COME BACK HERE!

11:54.882 --> 11:56.750
OH, NO!

11:56.784 --> 11:59.252
[girls giggling]
[groans]

11:59.286 --> 12:01.755
OKAY, OKAY,
I'M CALLING FOR BACKUP.

12:01.789 --> 12:06.059
THIS IS--OW, OW!
OW, LADIES, THAT'S REALLY TIGHT.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.061
THAT'S--OW! OW!

12:08.095 --> 12:09.062
IS THIS FUNNY?

12:09.096 --> 12:12.099
[cell phone rings]

12:12.132 --> 12:14.935
- HEY, MOUSSE, IT'S ME.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.870
NO CAN DO.
WE'RE PLAYING DARTS.

12:16.904 --> 12:21.074
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS ON MY TEAM,
AND SHE IS THROWING FIRE.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.443
- THERESA!
- NAILED IT!

12:23.476 --> 12:26.046
- I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
TOTALLY CRAZY,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.714
BUT I ALMOST FEEL LIKE

12:27.747 --> 12:29.817
CARLOS GAVE ME
TOO MANY COMPLIMENTS.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.284
- OH, YOU ARE NOT CRAZY.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.286
THERE IS NOTHING EMPTIER
THAN A COMPLIMENT

12:33.320 --> 12:35.122
FROM A GAY MAN
TO A STRAIGHT WOMAN HE JUST MET.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.891
- AND AGAIN,
TELL ME IF I'M WRONG HERE,

12:37.925 --> 12:41.895
BUT I JUST FELT LIKE HE WAS
TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT HIMSELF.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.596
- OH, I KNOW.
IT'S LIKE, "HELLO.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.497
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM."

12:44.531 --> 12:46.166
- [scoffs]

12:46.199 --> 12:47.467
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN HANDLE SOMEONE

12:47.500 --> 12:49.269
WHO TAKES UP
THAT MUCH EMOTIONAL SPACE.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.404
- WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A GAY BEST FRIEND, RIGHT?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.107
- YEAH, BUT I ALREADY HAVE ONE
TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN MY LIFE,

12:54.141 --> 12:55.442
YOU KNOW?
- POINT TAKEN.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.244
FORGET CARLOS.
- YEAH, FORGET CARLOS.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.946
- YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.647
ONE OF THE X-RAY TECHS,
ADAM.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.349
- HEY, HANK.
HOW'S IT GOING, BUDDY?

13:02.382 --> 13:05.953
- UH, NO OFFENSE, AUGGIE,
BUT COULD YOU SEND ADAM IN?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.620
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.356
I GOT IT.
ADAM?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.258
- WELL, WHAT'S HIS DEAL?
HE WAS CUTE.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.759
- NOT GAY.
ONLY DATES JEWISH GIRLS.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.494
- OH.
- BUT YOU'RE GONNA LIKE ADAM.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.829
I MEAN,
NOT THE MOST TRADITIONAL CHOICE,

13:15.863 --> 13:18.498
BUT HE'S INTERESTING, FUNNY,

13:18.531 --> 13:22.035
KIND OF NERDY
BUT IN A CUTE W--

13:22.069 --> 13:24.537
- OH, I RESENT THAT, HANK.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.839
- [whispering] LOVING ADAM.
- YEAH.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.175
THERE'S A LOT TO LOVE.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.044
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
THEY CAN'T ALL BE BEYONCE.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.113
- OBVIOUSLY.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.381
BRIAN'S TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM
RIGHT NOW

13:34.414 --> 13:35.048
WITH A GAME OF TRUTH OR DARE.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.017
- ARE YOU GUYS STUPID?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.852
TRUTH OR DARE IS THE WORST
POSSIBLE THING THAT YOU COULD DO

13:38.886 --> 13:40.320
WITH A GROUP OF GIRLS
WHO ARE MAD AT EACH OTHER.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.621
- WHAT?

13:41.654 --> 13:42.822
- HELL, WITH A GROUP OF GIRLS

13:42.856 --> 13:45.125
WHO LIKE EACH OTHER.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.826
FRIENDSHIPS END
BECAUSE OF THAT GAME.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.828
- I THOUGHT YOU ALL JUST DARED
EACH OTHER TO CALL BOYS

13:48.862 --> 13:50.363
AND THEN GOT IN PILLOW FIGHTS.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.698
- OH, I KNOW
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS

13:51.731 --> 13:53.400
BECAUSE YOU ARE A GUY,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.903
BUT SLEEPOVERS
ARE THE REAL DEAL.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.738
IT'S LIKE JUDGE DREDD, YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO CLIMB

13:58.771 --> 14:00.640
THE SOCIAL LADDER
BEFORE THE SUN RISES.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.043
- ONE'S JUST STARING AT ME.

14:03.076 --> 14:07.380
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN THERE.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.083
SHE'S LOOKING INTO MY SOUL, T.
- [laughs]

14:10.117 --> 14:11.084
- I NEED YOU.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.619
- OH, SUCK IT UP.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.063
- OKAY, OKAY.
- WE GOT THE DOOR.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.731
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
IN A SECOND.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.067
- IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.435
[both laughing]

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
- JOHNNY!
- JOHNNY, OVER HERE!

14:30.037 --> 14:30.837
- OKAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE
IN A SECOND!

14:30.870 --> 14:33.907
- [laughs]

14:33.941 --> 14:37.410
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
KATY PERRY GOT KNOCKED UP

14:37.444 --> 14:39.046
BY A SLUTTY MY LITTLE PONY.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.080
- YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS THE ONLY THING

14:40.113 --> 14:41.248
THAT KEPT THEM FROM FIGHTING.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.615
SO THEY'RE IN THERE.
GO.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.351
- OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE THEY
FIGHTING ABOUT?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
- OH.
- UH...

14:46.419 --> 14:48.088
- THE LITTLE ONE WAS PISSED.
- THE LITTLE ONE--YEAH.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.756
- YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.458
- NO.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.293
- THEY ALL TALK REALLY FAST.
- AND REALLY HIGH.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.061
- MM-HMM.
- LIKE DOLPHINS.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.196
- COME ON.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.066
IF YOU GUYS JUST TOOK A SECOND
TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM,

14:59.099 --> 15:02.735
THEN YOU'D KNOW HOW THIS STARTED
AND YOU'D KNOW HOW TO END IT.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.304
FORGET IT.
I'M WASTING MY BREATH.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.873
I'M JUST GONNA GO IN THERE
AND SORT THIS OUT.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.907
- PLEASE.
- MM.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.709
[door opens]
- [sighs]

15:09.742 --> 15:11.378
[indistinct chatter]
[door closes]

15:11.411 --> 15:13.646
- YO, THAT COLOR REALLY MAKES
YOUR EYES POP.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.382
DID YOU DO THAT?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.749
- NO, BILLY, THE GIRLS DID.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.019
- DANG, SOME REALLY GOOD
CONTOURING, BRO.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.621
[door opens]

15:21.654 --> 15:23.790
- OKAY, SO I FIGURED OUT
THE PROBLEM.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.759
SUSAN'S A BITCH.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.495
- ALL RIGHT, SHEILA,
THAT IS THE LAST TIME

15:28.528 --> 15:31.965
I PUMP YOU WITH LOW DOSES
OF DEADLY RADIATION, I SWEAR.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.401
- IT'S LIKE YOU CAN SEE
RIGHT THROUGH ME, ADAM.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.902
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.804
A BROKEN WOMAN.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.639
ACTUALLY, JUST A BROKEN RADIUS
AND ULNA.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.908
THE REST OF YOU
SEEMS REALLY GREAT.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.077
- THANK YOU, ADAM.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.413
NOW, THAT IS
A SINCERE COMPLIMENT.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.415
- MAYBE THE TWO OF YOU
CAN GET COFFEE SOMETIME.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.583
- I DISAGREE.
- OH.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.751
- I THINK
WE SHOULD SKIP THE COFFEE

15:51.784 --> 15:52.752
AND GO
STRAIGHT TO COCKTAILS.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.354
- OH.
[laughs]

15:54.387 --> 15:57.124
- I'M GONNA WRITE MY NUMBER DOWN
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.526
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.693
[whispers]
MY GOD, HE'S SO PERFECT.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.996
- GLAD I COULD HELP.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.165
- CALL ME.
- GREAT.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.800
NOW LET'S GET YOU IN A CAST AND
GET YOU HOME FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.336
- OKAY.
- YOU HAVE KIDS?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.604
- JUST ONE, CAITLYN,
SHE'S REALLY--

16:11.638 --> 16:14.307
- I'M SORRY,
KIDS ARE A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME.

16:14.341 --> 16:18.311
CHILDREN ARE JUST...

16:18.345 --> 16:20.113
- WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HANG OUT
WITH HER.

16:20.147 --> 16:20.980
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO MEET HER.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.850
- SHEILA, DON'T.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.953
- OKAY.
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

16:26.986 --> 16:31.558
THERE ARE A LOT
OF NICE GAY DOCTORS ON DUTY.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.693
- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BRING UP
THE KID?

16:33.726 --> 16:35.395
- I'M JUST SAYING, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH SUSAN.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.164
- YOU DON'T KNOW HER, JOHNNY.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.565
SHE ACTS ALL NICE
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.699
- YEAH, I'M NOT SURPRISED
BY THAT.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.534
SHE'S JUST LIKE MAEVE.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.037
SHE'S THAT GIRL WHO'LL STEAL
YOUR BOYFRIEND AND THEN

16:44.071 --> 16:47.040
CHANGE HER ENTIRE PERSONALITY
TO FIT WHATEVER'S POPULAR.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.375
- SHE'S TEN, AND YOU WERE
WITH HER FOR A MINUTE.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.009
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.512
THERE'S ALWAYS A SUSAN,
TRUST ME,

16:52.545 --> 16:54.047
ALL THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.049
MARIE ANTOINETTE,
TOTAL GODDAMN SUSAN.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.217
- SEE, I THINK YOU'RE BRINGING
SOME OF YOUR PERSONAL STUFF

16:57.250 --> 16:59.186
INTO THIS SITUATION.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.054
- HEY, I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU ARE TAKING HER SIDE.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.155
- I'M NOT TAKING HER SIDE.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.823
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT MAYBE SUSAN

17:03.856 --> 17:05.525
AND HER FRIENDS WERE
A LITTLE DEFENSIVE BECAUSE--

17:05.558 --> 17:06.926
AND I'M ONLY QUOTING EMMA HERE--
YOU STROLLED IN HERE

17:06.959 --> 17:08.895
LIKE YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE EVERYTHING.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.330
- WHICH ONE'S EMMA, HUH,
THE LITTLE BLONDE SLUT?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.331
- WHOA.
- OH, GOD.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.666
- YOU GUYS ARE SO BLIND.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.835
SUSAN HAS COMPLETELY HIJACKED
THIS SLEEPOVER

17:15.868 --> 17:17.437
AND CREATED
A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.905
IT IS CAITLYN'S HOUSE.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.507
IT IS CAITLYN'S BIRTHDAY.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.444
- SO SHE KEEPS SAYING.
IT'S LIKE, "WE KNOW."

17:24.477 --> 17:26.346
JACKPOT, FOUND THE HOOCH.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.548
- OH, NO, NO, NO,
WE'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.717
- SO WE'LL ADD WATER LATER.
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.553
- BUT, MAEVE.
- DON'T BE LAME, BRIAN.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.288
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.023
- TO SUSAN?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.725
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.095
- IS THERESA BEING UNCOOL
AT A SLUMBER PARTY? SHOCKER.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.463
- WHATEVER, YOU WERE
THE ONE THAT USED TO CALL DAD

17:43.496 --> 17:44.397
TO PICK YOU UP
BEFORE MIDNIGHT,

17:44.431 --> 17:46.065
AND GUESS WHO HAD TO GO TOO

17:46.099 --> 17:47.534
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE TWO TRIPS.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.302
- I HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS
TO YOU.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.038
LEAVING A SLUMBER PARTY EARLY
IS A POWER MOVE.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.174
THIS IS WHY YOU WEREN'T COOL
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

17:58.077 --> 17:58.945
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL SUSAN?

17:58.978 --> 18:01.114
- HMM?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.282
- I'M GONNA TELL HER TO COME
IN HERE AND LOOK AT HER FUTURE.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.783
- YOU ARE BEING SUCH A CAITLYN
RIGHT NOW.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.218
- YOU RUINED MIDDLE SCHOOL
FOR ME.

18:05.252 --> 18:09.289
- YOUR UNIBROW RUINED
MIDDLE SCHOOL FOR YOU.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.957
- WELL, I DON'T HAVE
A UNIBROW NOW.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.892
- IT IS BURNED INTO YOUR SOUL.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.328
WE ARE ALL STILL WHO WE WERE
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.997
YOU'RE STILL UNCOOL,
BRIAN'S STILL LAME,

18:18.030 --> 18:20.133
JOHNNY'S STILL A WEIRDO,

18:20.167 --> 18:22.169
AND I'M STILL DATING
THE HOTTEST GUY IN THE ROOM.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.570
- OH, THANKS, BABE.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.605
YO, Y'ALL READY
TO SEE THE SHOW?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.973
- THEY PUT THE SHOW TOGETHER?

18:27.006 --> 18:28.141
- WELL, I HELPED THEM
A LITTLE BIT.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.742
- OH.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.644
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S GREAT.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.746
I'M JUST HAPPY
THE SHOW'S HAPPENING.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.748
- YEAH, THESE GIRLS ARE
SO SWEET.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.984
GUESS WHAT.
THEY PICKED ME TO BE BEYONCE.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.253
- THEY KEEP CALLING ME
BILLYONCE, YO.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.689
- AW.
- SHOULD'VE BEEN LILY.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.924
- WHY, 'CAUSE SHE'S--
[mouths word]

18:44.957 --> 18:46.759
- NO, BECAUSE I THINK
SHE'S GOT THE CHOPS.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.163
- COME ON, MAN, YOU AND I BOTH
KNOW THAT AIN'T TRUE.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.465
- YEAH.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.770
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TONIGHT.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.473
I WOULD SAY "LET'S DO IT AGAIN
SOMETIME," BUT...

19:00.507 --> 19:04.177
- I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T PAN OUT
WITH THE DOCTOR.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.112
GUESS I SHOULD'VE CHECKED TO SEE
IF HE WAS ACTUALLY GAY FIRST.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.381
- HONESTLY, I WAS OFFENDED
BY HOW MUCH HE WAS OFFENDED.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.450
- I KNOW.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.219
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
GET YOU A GAY BEST FRIEND.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.020
- IT'S FINE.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.689
IT JUST SUCKS BEING
A SINGLE PARENT SOMETIMES.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.858
YOU NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO HAVE FUN,

19:18.891 --> 19:20.293
SO THEN NO ONE THINKS
YOU'RE FUN,

19:20.327 --> 19:23.230
AND THEN NO FUN EVER HAPPENS.
- MM.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.064
- MY KID THINKS I'M THE LEAST
FUN PERSON ON THE PLANET.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.366
- OKAY, I JUST WANNA STATE,
FOR THE RECORD,

19:26.399 --> 19:28.201
THAT GAY MEN
ARE NOT HUMAN ACCESSORIES.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.403
WE DO NOT EXIST
TO FILL THE FUN HOLE

19:30.437 --> 19:33.005
IN STRAIGHT WOMEN'S LIVES.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.342
- JESUS.

19:35.375 --> 19:39.045
OKAY, I GOT IT.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.614
I WILL NOT LOOK TO GAY MEN
TO FILL ANY OF MY HOLES.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.455
[both laughing]

19:50.423 --> 19:53.393
- OKAY, OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.194
I WON'T DO ANY
OF THAT OTHER GAY SHIT WITH YOU,

19:55.228 --> 19:58.331
BUT I DO LIKE BRUNCH.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.900
- I LOVE BRUNCH.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.176
- FIVE, A-SIX,
A-FIVE, A-SIX, A-SEVEN, EIGHT.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.512
AND SLIDE AND SLIDE.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.081
AND BODY ROLL,
BODY ROLL,

20:15.114 --> 20:17.417
AND SLIDE
AND SLIDE.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.086
AND BODY ROLL, BODY ROLL.
- WHOO!

20:20.119 --> 20:22.689
- AND ROLL IT
AND ROLL IT.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.024
AND FREESTYLE TIME,
A-FREESTYLE TIME,

20:25.057 --> 20:27.193
LET ME SEE YOUR HIPS MOVING
FREESTYLE TIME.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.329
A-FREESTYLE TIME, OKAY.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.565
- [laughs]
- [gasps]

20:32.599 --> 20:35.302
MOM, YOU'RE BACK!

20:35.335 --> 20:37.937
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOUR MOM'S A TOTAL ROCK STAR.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.439
YOU KNOW SHE BROKE HER ARM
IN TWO PLACES?

20:39.472 --> 20:43.242
- EW, GROSS.
all: WHOA!

20:43.276 --> 20:45.077
- HEY, WHO WANTS TO SIGN
CAITLYN'S MOM'S COOL CAST?

20:45.111 --> 20:47.146
all: ME!

20:47.179 --> 20:48.381
- CAITLYN, YOU GET THE GLITTER.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.283
I'LL GET THE MARKERS.
- OKAY.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.386
- WELL, I SEE SUSAN'S
PUT HERSELF IN CHARGE AGAIN.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.488
- RIGHT?
- THERE'S ALWAYS A SUSAN.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.357
- WORD.
