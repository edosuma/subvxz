WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.038
(chuckles)

00:06.107 --> 00:07.108
(gasps)

00:12.380 --> 00:14.014
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.048 --> 00:16.450
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.354
MAC:
I hope they don't show us

00:20.388 --> 00:22.156
some boring art house movie.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.891
CHARLIE:
Well, the title
of the move is terrible.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.693
I mean, Focus Group?
What is that?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.728
Focus Group isn't the title
of the movie.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.030
-We're in a focus group.
-Huh?

00:30.064 --> 00:33.367
Charlie, we're here to watch,
analyze, critique,

00:33.401 --> 00:34.835
and then,
most importantly, judge

00:34.868 --> 00:36.537
whatever film
we're gonna be shown.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.906
Uh, these filmmakers--
they need valuable input,

00:38.939 --> 00:40.408
and we have been carefully
selected to provide it.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.376
We were walking out of the mall,

00:42.410 --> 00:44.678
and they offered us
Red Lobster gift cards.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.879
Nevertheless, you know,
they've chosen wisely.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.881
Uh, good afternoon, everyone.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.017
I-I want to thank you
for joining us today.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.254
Now, your feedback
is very important to us.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.422
-Sweet.
-I'm sorry.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.723
I'm just a little confused here,

00:55.756 --> 00:56.890
'cause I can't
follow this movie.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.360
The movie hasn't started yet.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.362
Yeah, uh, Moderator,
not to worry.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.232
I-I just want to assure you that
your movie is in good hands.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.566
Y-You've chosen wisely.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.402
See, I, myself,
am a prolific filmmaker.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.905
In fact,
while you don't thrill me,

01:11.939 --> 01:14.208
I might even consider you
for one of my roles.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.945
Well, thank you, um,
but I'm not really a performer.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.281
I'll get a performance
out of you.

01:20.314 --> 01:24.051
-Uh, where will we appear
in the credits?
-In the credits?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.453
-Are we gonna be at the front?
-Yeah, for our contribution.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.387
-Sort of the beginning
of the film, or...?
-Yeah.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.756
Well, you-you will not be.

01:28.789 --> 01:32.426
But your opinions
are valuable to us.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.094
-And you're gonna get
a lot of them. (chuckles)
-Oh, yeah.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.663
I'm already tearing
this entire experience apart.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.631
-As am I.
-DEE: Me, too.

01:37.665 --> 01:38.899
-Why don't we just start?
-I'll tell you what.
Why don't you

01:38.932 --> 01:40.468
-just go ahead and show us
-Let's just, let's see.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.236
whatever piece of shit
you're gonna show us, you know,

01:42.270 --> 01:43.804
-Yeah.
-so we can tear it apart
and get out to Red Lobster?

01:43.837 --> 01:46.073
-DEE: Yeah, I'm hungry.
-Okay.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.776
So the title of the film is...

01:48.809 --> 01:52.346
Thunder Gun 4: Maximum Cool.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.614
-Oh!
-What?!
-Oh!

01:53.647 --> 01:55.949
-Really?!
-Holy...
-(laughter)

02:19.573 --> 02:21.475
(dramatic music plays)

02:21.509 --> 02:23.644
(loud whooshing)

02:23.677 --> 02:25.413
(dramatic music plays)

02:28.416 --> 02:29.650
(Frank groans)

02:29.683 --> 02:30.951
Uh... uh...

02:30.984 --> 02:33.454
What was that?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.523
I, uh... I'm not sure.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.459
-Uh...
-I-I was totally lost.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.861
Did they make Thunder Gun bad?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.130
-Yeah.
-Okay. So,

02:43.163 --> 02:44.498
that was our movie.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.400
Now, clearly,
the film is not done,

02:46.434 --> 02:47.501
but still a work in progress.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.969
-Oh.
-Oh.
-Oh, thank God!

02:49.002 --> 02:51.038
-Oh.
-Okay, great.
-Oh, Jesus.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.540
Okay, so let's adjourn
to the conference room

02:52.573 --> 02:54.375
to begin our session.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.709
-Let's get into it. Yeah.
-Yeah. Let's-let's fix it.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.378
-We can, uh, we can fix it.
-Oh, yeah.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.912
MODERATOR:
Okay, why don't we just

02:58.946 --> 03:00.814
break it down, act by act?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.816
I'll play back a scene
from the first act,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.718
and then we can discuss.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.154
-Yeah, okay. All right.
-Okay.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.863
* Train roll on... *

03:15.896 --> 03:17.698
(sighs)

03:17.731 --> 03:19.400
-Excuse me.
-* On down the line... *

03:19.433 --> 03:22.102
Is your name John?
John ThunderGun?

03:22.135 --> 03:24.071
(ThunderGun sighs)

03:24.104 --> 03:28.075
Mm. Maybe once.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.943
Not anymore.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.779
I'm Dr. Ling.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.748
This is my assistant Max.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.385
I'm head of research
and development for Com-Tec.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.919
We need your help.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.954
Why?

03:40.988 --> 03:43.891
You got a bottle of whiskey
that needs draining?

03:43.924 --> 03:46.059
A man named Colonel Washington
has stolen a formula

03:46.093 --> 03:47.795
from our lab.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.030
In the wrong hands,
this formula could be used

03:50.063 --> 03:51.865
as a powerful weapon.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.302
A weapon that could destroy
millions of lives.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.538
We need it back,
but he wants something from us.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.542
Oh, yeah? What's that?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.445
Not what, but who.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.380
(whooshing)

04:06.414 --> 04:08.282
I am Colonel Washington.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.585
You know my reputation,
so you'll give me what I seek.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.254
Where is ThunderGun?

04:14.288 --> 04:16.390
Right here.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.926
Me.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.528
I am ThunderGun.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.997
I am ThunderGun.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.999
I am ThunderGun.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.267
(chanting):
I am ThunderGun!

04:27.301 --> 04:29.102
I am ThunderGun!

04:29.136 --> 04:31.639
I am ThunderGun!
I am ThunderGun!

04:31.672 --> 04:34.342
I am-- (yelling)

04:34.375 --> 04:35.576
(machinegun fire continues)

04:35.609 --> 04:37.244
Okay, who has questions
about the setup?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.447
-Mm.
-Oh.
-Oh!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.914
-Me, me, me, me!
-FRANK: Yeah.
-(Dee groans)

04:40.948 --> 04:44.017
-Um, let's start with you.
-What's being set up?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.786
Um... the entire movie.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.755
The, uh...

04:47.788 --> 04:50.023
So, the main characters,
the story, the villain.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.792
That's where you lost me.
Who's the bad guy?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.961
Well, Colonel Washington,
obviously.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.429
That's not clear.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.798
In the old movies,
the good guy wore white,

04:57.831 --> 05:00.968
the bad guy wore black,
or was black.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.504
Well, depending on the hero.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.772
Right?
It's-it's not a racial thing.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.273
-Mm.
-It's about opposites.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
See, I want the bad guy
to be different than me

05:08.342 --> 05:10.277
-so I know why I hate him.
-DEE: Mm-hmm.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.845
-FRANK: Mm.
-I hate people
who are different than me.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.847
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Like Rocky one.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.483
Bad guy was black.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.117
Rocky II-- another black guy.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.488
Rocky III-- different black guy
with a mohawk.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.055
-Right.
-Yeah, but in Die Hard,

05:22.089 --> 05:23.557
-the bad guy was foreign, right?
-Hmm.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.792
-FRANK: Yeah.
-So I know why I hate him.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.959
-DEE: There we go.
-FRANK: Yeah.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.995
People hate foreigners.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.363
-Right.
-Yeah, we hate them.
-Right? So in Thunder Gun,

05:29.397 --> 05:30.564
you don't have
to do any reshoots, right?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.199
-FRANK: Yeah.
-Don't-don't make him black.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.368
-Just give him an accent.
-What kind of accent?

05:34.402 --> 05:36.136
What about Australian?
That's pretty foreign.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.405
No, that's not gonna work.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.072
'Cause they're white.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.409
No, because they're fun.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.477
They're a very fun group
of people, right? I mean...

05:43.511 --> 05:45.513
-DEE: Yeah.
-Try to hate an Australian.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.880
-It's impossible.
-A bunch of rapscallions.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.181
-Little rascals.
-Ooh, but French, though.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.017
-French. (groans)
-Ugh.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Snobby. Snobby, yes.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.488
Yes, yes.
You will definitely dislike him,

05:54.522 --> 05:57.224
but you won't fear him because
he's most likely a pussy.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.226
-Oh.
-Right.
-That's right.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.193
-Not scary. Not scary.
-Right, right.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.662
When in doubt,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.330
-go Eastern European, right?
-Right.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.565
-That's a classically evil part
of the world.
-Uh-huh.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.233
-There you go.
-That'd work.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.869
You know, let's talk a bit
about the female character.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.771
-Nah.
-Do we have to?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.006
-I would love to.
-The studio needs

06:13.040 --> 06:14.241
a female perspective.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.610
What did you think of Dr. Ling?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.046
Oh, I think she sucks.
First of all, she comes in

06:19.079 --> 06:22.516
with a whole plan,
like she's starting the movie.

06:22.550 --> 06:27.054
So, you... you want the female
characters to have less agency?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.757
Yeah. Look, I feel bad enough
about myself as is.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.693
I don't need some super hot,
funny, smart chick doing, like,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.596
roundhouse kicks
and cracking computer codes

06:35.629 --> 06:37.565
-to make me feel worse.
-FRANK: Mm. Mm-hmm.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.568
No. No. I-I like the women of
the old Thunder Gun days, right?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.269
Bed 'em and dead 'em.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.205
Look, first act,
he meets a lady.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.374
She's super hot,
but I'm smarter, right?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.477
And then he bangs her,
and she gets dead.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.078
And-and later on,
he meets someone.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.146
All right, this one's smart,
I'll give her that,

06:53.180 --> 06:54.715
but I'm funnier. (chuckles)

06:54.748 --> 06:56.216
You know what I mean?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.951
He bangs her, she gets dead,
and then,

06:57.985 --> 07:00.053
and in the end, he falls in love
with an ugly one,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.455
and who cares about that?
I don't care about that.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.123
And then she gets dead,
and that sets up

07:03.156 --> 07:04.424
for the next movie,
and I'm all in.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.794
Because all
of the women are dead.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.629
You know? No competition.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.464
-Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.
-FRANK: Yeah.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.932
-DEE: Right?
-Okay, yeah. Write that down.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.434
-Women hate women.
-I... (sighs)

07:14.468 --> 07:17.104
I think the studio was trying
to get away

07:17.137 --> 07:19.507
from the female character
just acting

07:19.540 --> 07:22.075
as a plot device
or a sex trophy.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.977
-Ah, but, yeah, why?
-Why?

07:24.011 --> 07:26.313
-But that works.
-Okay, let's move past this.

07:26.346 --> 07:30.150
Let's take it into the
second act with this next clip.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.320
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, ThunderGun.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.623
Don't lose hope.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.625
We may get out of this yet.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.259
But if we don't,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
I think there's something
I should tell you.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.831
We've met before.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.533
Detroit.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.367
Winter.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.102
At a bar.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.104
I went home with you.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.107
The next morning, you were gone,

07:54.141 --> 07:56.744
and I never heard
from you again.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.281
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.284
I never was good
at being tied down.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.887
(chuckles)
No, it's not that. It's just...

08:06.920 --> 08:09.523
(exhales)
My assistant.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.991
You know Max.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.661
Well, he's not just
my assistant.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.696
He's my son.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.400
-Are you trying to tell me...
-Yes, John.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.169
He's your son, too.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.072
Max is your son.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.007
MODERATOR:
Okay.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.209
So, this is the midpoint twist.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.711
What is?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.546
Um, ThunderGun finding out
he has a son.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.313
-Mm-hmm.
-He has a son?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.549
Yes.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.317
But how is this the twist?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.318
I mean, because he's got a kid?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.154
I mean, he's probably got
a thousand kids,

08:41.188 --> 08:43.890
all the raw-dog loads he drops.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.027
I don't know
what "raw-dog loads" are.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.029
Sorry for him.
But my disgusting friend

08:49.062 --> 08:50.530
does bring up a good point.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.365
I mean, every Thunder Gun movie

08:52.399 --> 08:55.603
has at least one very tasteful
yet very erotic sex scene in it,

08:55.636 --> 08:57.270
-and this had none.
-FRANK: Mm.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.172
Yeah. I've-I've been waiting
for the right time

08:59.206 --> 09:01.041
to bring this up, but I feel
like we need to address

09:01.074 --> 09:02.710
the elephant in the room, no?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.377
-Yeah, this is a big one for us.
-Might as well.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.946
-I've been thinking about it.
-Might as well.
-Yeah.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.347
Okay, so...

09:07.380 --> 09:08.682
where's the dong?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.283
(Charlie clicks tongue)

09:10.317 --> 09:12.419
The-the dong?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.353
-The dong.
-Yeah.
-DEE: Yeah, yeah.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.521
Yeah, the dong. The dong.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.689
John ThunderGun has hung dong

09:15.723 --> 09:17.758
in every chapter of this saga.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.392
And, well, I just watched
90 minutes of one,

09:19.426 --> 09:21.061
and yet not one hang.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.031
Well, I think
that the studio was thinking

09:24.064 --> 09:28.535
the gratuitous nudity
was maybe a bit much.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.537
-Fuck you.
-(Frank groans)
-Bullshit!

09:30.570 --> 09:33.240
-Bullshit!
-This is exactly the type
of Hollywood bullshit

09:33.273 --> 09:34.708
-that America is sick of.
-CHARLIE: What are you
talking about?

09:34.742 --> 09:36.543
Hollywood's
completely out of touch.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.545
-So out of touch
with what people want!
-Don't you want to give people

09:38.578 --> 09:41.314
-what people actually want?
-There's a bigger issue here.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.316
Movies are different now.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.753
You lost a sense of community.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.921
Interesting. Go on.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.791
Look, years ago,
before the Internet,

09:50.824 --> 09:53.260
we would all go out
to the movies together.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.795
Yes.
This is exactly what studios

09:54.828 --> 09:57.230
are trying to bring back.
A-An event.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.300
-A place we can all go
to enjoy as a community.
-FRANK: Yeah.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.002
I mean, it used to be

10:02.035 --> 10:05.005
you give the creep-show
at the window a couple of bucks,

10:05.038 --> 10:07.607
you could spend all day in there
popping off.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.110
And the joy of it was that
there were people popping off

10:10.143 --> 10:11.344
at the same time.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.612
I mean, n-not that you looked

10:12.646 --> 10:14.347
at each other. It was dark.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.249
You weren't looking
for the gay thing.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.352
But it gave you a sense of
something bigger than yourself.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.822
Now, they... you know,

10:21.855 --> 10:23.456
got rid
of all these movie theaters.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.625
They're taking all the sex out
of the movies.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.327
And what am I supposed to do?

10:27.360 --> 10:31.131
Go home, turn the lights off
and pop off in front of Charlie?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.499
No, thanks.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.868
I'm sorry.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.705
Are you talking
about pornography theaters?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.874
I'm talking
about community, honey.

10:40.908 --> 10:44.144
Right. E... Uh, yeah,
even if the studios

10:44.177 --> 10:45.713
wanted to put back in
the nudity,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.848
they couldn't
because of the new rating.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.117
Wh-What do you mean,
the new rating?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.986
Thunder Gun: Maximum Cool
will be rated PG-13.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.554
What?

10:54.587 --> 10:55.989
(Dee gasps)

10:56.023 --> 10:59.326
Now, that's
quite a midpoint twist.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.627
They did it! They did.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.963
They ruined everything
with this PC bullshit.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
Straight white men
can't have anything anymore.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.735
Men? Look,
don't forget white women.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.803
We got completely passed over.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.705
Yeah, and I can't follow
any of this.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.173
We're feeling a lot of outrage
right now, you know,

11:13.206 --> 11:14.507
because we want something,
and we know we deserve it,

11:14.541 --> 11:15.675
-but we're not getting it.
-Mm.

11:15.709 --> 11:19.546
I'm mad, but I don't know
at what anymore.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.348
-That's what it is!
-(all talking at once)

11:21.381 --> 11:22.482
MAC:
That's what it is!
I'm pissed!

11:22.515 --> 11:23.650
-Aah! I'm mad.
-Listen, listen.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.052
Our way of life is changing,

11:25.085 --> 11:26.519
-and that's scary.
-Right.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.756
-We don't want to change.
-Oh, that makes me so angry.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.890
-Makes me mad.
-I want to cling

11:29.923 --> 11:31.558
to the way things were,
but they're done.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.026
-Let's get out of here.
-DENNIS: Let's run from this.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.327
-We'll run from it.
-Wait, wait, wait,

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
-wait, wait.
-Do we have to, legally?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.364
Guys, we can't run.
Come on.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.599
What's ThunderGun's slogan?

11:39.632 --> 11:43.370
"No hesitation, no surrender,
no man left behind."

11:43.403 --> 11:44.437
Did we leave a guy
in there, though?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.839
Goddamn right we did, Charlie,

11:45.873 --> 11:49.242
and his name is
John ThunderGun.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.078
-(martial music playing)
-Like it or not,

11:51.111 --> 11:53.180
we have a civic duty to uphold.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.948
We owe it to ourselves,
to ThunderGun,

11:54.982 --> 11:56.716
and to movie audiences
all over the world

11:56.750 --> 11:59.219
to put a stop to this
liberal, PC bullshit.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.954
-DEE: Mm-hmm.
-But I think
we have been selected

12:00.988 --> 12:03.690
for a cosmic reason here;
to put an end to this.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.093
To not pull our punches.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.295
To save the dong.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.099
Save the dong.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.603
-Save the dong.
-Save the dong.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.708
-I agree.
-Oh, for God's sakes.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.977
-This is why you don't
include women.
-DENNIS: Are you kidding me?!

12:24.011 --> 12:25.412
What?!

12:25.445 --> 12:26.713
Don't you see that
there was a rhythm?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.315
-Like a cinematic rhythm.
-Oh, let's do it again.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.217
-Let's do it again.
-No way. No way!

12:30.250 --> 12:31.418
-I get it now.
-You-you can't--

12:31.451 --> 12:32.452
You can't give women
the zingers.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.292
Now, you listen here,
you goddamn Hollywood communist.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.427
I live in Roxborough.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.329
Again, I didn't make this movie.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.898
Listen to me, listen to me.
If you start to strip sex

12:44.932 --> 12:46.766
out of our communities,
out of our culture

12:46.800 --> 12:48.435
and-and even our art,

12:48.468 --> 12:51.271
not only do you isolate people,
but you create an oppression

12:51.304 --> 12:53.240
disguised as morality.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.975
I mean, the--
the Thunder Gun series

12:55.008 --> 12:57.144
has always been groundbreaking
in so many ways,

12:57.177 --> 13:00.013
notwithstanding the recognition
of an inequality

13:00.047 --> 13:03.183
that was present in cinema
since its beginning days.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.253
The objectifying
of the female form. I mean,

13:06.286 --> 13:09.789
with Thunder Gun, a great
injustice was rectified. Okay?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.191
Fairness of the sexes.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.127
A unification
of the human condition.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.929
I'm sorry, is this still about
the flaccid penis

13:15.963 --> 13:17.330
you'd like to see?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.698
You're goddamn right!

13:18.731 --> 13:20.367
-MAC: Yeah.
-We want to see it.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.769
Yes, we want to see
the man's dick, but--

13:22.802 --> 13:24.337
I guess what I'm saying is that
it's no longer

13:24.371 --> 13:25.638
just about gratuitous boobs,

13:25.672 --> 13:27.340
it's also about
gratuitous penis.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.677
I mean, ThunderGun
was about progress.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.214
Right. Uh, I think
we all can agree

13:34.247 --> 13:37.317
that public opinion has sort of
turned against the idea

13:37.350 --> 13:39.286
of someone exposing themselves.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.521
-(all groan)
-Oh, here we go. Here we go.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.157
-This is a different thing.
-You're not understanding it.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.894
See, ThunderGun didn't take his
dick out to intimidate people.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.496
He did it because he had
accomplished his mission.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.664
He wanted to kick back
and call it a day.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.800
He did do it once
to intimidate someone,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.468
-but that was the bad guy.
-CHARLIE: It was the bad guy.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.704
And it just so happened
the bad guy was a female.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.073
That was the best one.
That was the best one!

14:00.107 --> 14:02.542
-That was funny.
-It made me wish I had a dong

14:02.575 --> 14:05.545
that I could pull out
to celebrate my accomplishments.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.815
You know? Or maybe just
feel the cool breeze

14:08.848 --> 14:12.152
gently tickle the shaft on a,
on a crisp autumn morn.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.655
-I don't know, whatever men do
to-to feel powerful.
-That's what it is.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.723
It really is.
It really is.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.558
Listen, Moderator,
the point is this.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.327
I mean,
it used to be only, like,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.596
the hard-line conservatives,
like the pearl-clutching types,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.732
were the only ones
that were overly vocal

14:25.765 --> 14:28.435
and extreme in their
policing of sexuality.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.104
But now you got this, like,
liberal wave

14:31.138 --> 14:33.440
of moral authority
sweeping the nation.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.075
You know, it's nuts.
I mean, think about it.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.410
If the conservatives had
always run Hollywood,

14:37.444 --> 14:39.346
movies would have sucked.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.781
You know what I mean?
The art would have suffered.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.216
So I guess the question
we're asking is

14:43.250 --> 14:45.852
how will art fare
under the oppressive thumb

14:45.885 --> 14:49.722
of this new liberal
Hollywood moral PC elite?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.724
Well, I don't know.
It's tough to say.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.361
But is that a world
that we want to live in?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.064
I say no.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.599
I say give me dong

14:59.632 --> 15:01.268
or give me death.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.702
ALL:
Yeah!

15:02.735 --> 15:03.903
CHARLIE:
Yeah, man, don't tell me

15:03.937 --> 15:05.973
what I can see
and what I can't see.

15:06.006 --> 15:10.077
So, uh, just to be clear here,
they didn't make it PG-13

15:10.110 --> 15:12.145
because of political
correctness.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.381
-Oh, did they not?
-No. No-no. They-they
made it PG-13

15:14.414 --> 15:15.548
because rated-R movies

15:15.582 --> 15:18.285
aren't making
as much money anymore.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.288
Because of streaming,
and most importantly,

15:21.321 --> 15:24.157
-piracy.
-Piracy, huh?

15:24.191 --> 15:26.426
Yeah, and how have you all
been viewing the franchise?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.428
-Oh, no-no, not through piracy.
-No.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.098
In f-- In fact, we,
we-we saw the last installment

15:31.131 --> 15:32.765
of-of the franchise
out in the theater.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.667
-We barely made it.
-We barely made it.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.835
Oh, wait, no-no, hold on,

15:35.868 --> 15:37.904
but Frank called in
that bomb threat.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.306
Oh, but-but that was okay,
because remember,

15:39.339 --> 15:41.441
then we went home, and we,
we saw it on the Internet.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.942
-Caught it online.
-We caught it online.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.777
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. On that
website that has all the movies.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.479
So, that's-- that is pirating.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.115
No, no, no,
pirating is stealing.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.816
We didn't steal it, okay?
We just downloaded it.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.419
Uh, the website is called
"MoviePirate.com."

15:52.452 --> 15:54.354
MAC:
And the other one is called,

15:54.387 --> 15:55.855
uh, "FreeMovies/Arrrgh."

15:55.888 --> 15:59.859
Ah, I'm starting to see
a little bit of a pattern here,

15:59.892 --> 16:03.430
because, uh, I also use one
called "StolenMovies.free."

16:03.463 --> 16:06.499
So... you're part
of the problem.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.801
Because of people like you,
the studios felt like

16:08.835 --> 16:11.038
this was their only recourse.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.706
PG-13 opens up
a whole new market.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.674
You're saying it's our fault

16:14.707 --> 16:16.509
that we don't get
to see the dong?

16:16.543 --> 16:17.710
You're coming in there changing
everything, you know,

16:17.744 --> 16:19.046
getting rid of the dong, I mean,

16:19.079 --> 16:20.513
how is that
even Thunder Gun anymore?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.948
Well, yeah,
th-they're changing it.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.352
They're rebooting
the entire franchise.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.853
-What?
-What d-- What?

16:26.886 --> 16:29.822
You guys didn't get that
from the final scene?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.658
CHARLIE:
Uh, no, what...?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.393
Okay. Let's review.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.195
(wind whistling)

16:37.197 --> 16:38.231
(groans)

16:39.399 --> 16:41.968
I'm not gonna make it
through this one.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.038
We can both go detonate
the hydro-fusion bomb.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.175
No hesitation. No surrender.
No man left behind!

16:48.208 --> 16:49.642
Not this time.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.844
No, Dad.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.846
Please.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.184
Sometimes in order
to save something...

16:57.217 --> 16:58.185
you have to destroy something.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.854
You'll need this
to get out of here, son.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.128
To continue our story.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.866
(grunts)

17:13.900 --> 17:16.868
(panting)

17:16.903 --> 17:19.271
(dramatic music playing)

17:19.306 --> 17:20.906
(inaudible)

17:22.442 --> 17:24.411
So, you see,
they're rebooting the franchise

17:24.444 --> 17:25.912
for a younger audience.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.280
The only people who are actually

17:27.314 --> 17:28.715
still going to see movies.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.084
I did not get that.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.186
Well, you haven't gotten
anything the entire day.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.687
Got to side with Charlie
on this one.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.424
I didn't get it. Now, wh-what
was with the fire stick?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.058
You mean the torch?

17:39.092 --> 17:41.394
The one he passed
to his son Max--

17:41.428 --> 17:43.530
as in Maximum Cool-- and said,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.298
"You need to continue
our story"?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.600
It's the camera guy
who screwed up.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.869
'Cause ThunderGun, he fell
into that fiery abyss,

17:49.902 --> 17:52.038
-and for some reason,
we're watching the kid...
-Yeah,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.641
we wanted to go down
into the volcano with John...

17:54.674 --> 17:56.809
No-no, you guys don't get it.
It's a cliffhanger. Yeah?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.112
It's a cliffhanger. We're gonna
find out what happened to John

17:59.146 --> 18:01.614
in the next movie,
Thunder Gun 5...

18:01.648 --> 18:03.883
-Ooh...
-Or, or there's
a post-credit scene

18:03.916 --> 18:06.719
-that we didn't get to see, yes?
-No. No. There's none of that.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.721
This isn't a cliffhanger.
He's dead.

18:08.755 --> 18:13.293
John is dead.
Now we follow the son's story.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.961
-No!
-I don't, I don't want to.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.095
-I don't think so.
-DENNIS: No.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.096
You don't have to think.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.065
I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.501
ThunderGun fell into a volcano.

18:21.534 --> 18:25.838
He died. And now his son Max
becomes Thunder Son,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.175
the face of the franchise
moving forward.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.577
-(Frank sighs)
-Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

18:30.610 --> 18:32.011
He has a son?

18:32.044 --> 18:35.348
Fuck, man! What?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.817
-How do you not get that?
-It wasn't clear.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.420
Reshoots. Reshoots.
You got to reshoot.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.789
-Yeah, reshoots.
-Reshoots to make the movie
more clear...

18:42.822 --> 18:44.524
No! That's not what
we're gonna do.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.460
We're out of time.
That's it. That's-- We're done.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.430
But you're ruining our
favorite movie! Uh... (exhales)

18:50.463 --> 18:52.699
-How can we save the movies
that we love?
-Yeah.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.101
Maybe if you actually
go out to the theaters

18:55.134 --> 18:57.770
and pay to see them, then they
will continue to make them.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.808
Whoa! Oh, that's easy
for you to say!

19:01.841 --> 19:04.344
With your Hollywood liberal
bank account!

19:04.377 --> 19:06.313
Jesus!
Who a you people?!

19:07.580 --> 19:11.184
I... am ThunderGun.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.787
I...
am ThunderGun.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.957
I... am ThunderGun.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.626
DENNIS and DEE:
I am... Thundergun.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.727
DENNIS:
Goddammit, Dee!

19:20.760 --> 19:22.695
-Dee...
-How did you not feel

19:22.729 --> 19:24.231
-that I was next and then you?
-I don't know.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.398
MAC:
There was a build to it,

19:25.432 --> 19:26.899
-and then...
-It's like, we're trying

19:26.933 --> 19:29.402
to give the woman the final
thing, and she can't do it.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.803
-Okay, start it over.
-You can't go back.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.440
-Start it over?
-You see the problem with women.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.311
Well, RIP ThunderGun, I guess.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.746
Yeah. What a waste.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.215
I recorded
that whole thing for nothing.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.183
Dong-less!

19:44.217 --> 19:46.185
Wait a second.
You recorded the whole thing?

19:46.219 --> 19:49.021
-Yeah.
-Guys... hang on a second.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.057
Do you remember
what ThunderGun said?

19:51.090 --> 19:53.159
Sometimes, in order
to sav something,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.195
you have to destroy something.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.998
And I think I know what we have
to do to save Thunder Gun.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.400
Destroy it?

20:00.433 --> 20:01.868
Well, how are we gonna do that?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.837
With a little help.
From some pirates.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.341
-(dramatic music playing)
-No hesitation.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.676
No surrender.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.612
ALL:
No man left behind!

20:12.645 --> 20:14.247

20:33.633 --> 20:35.635
(hopeful music playing)

20:44.243 --> 20:46.679
(triumphant music playing)

20:51.418 --> 20:53.420
Mmm.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.891
I'm bored.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.126
Well, it looks like
this new Thunder Gun movie's

21:00.159 --> 21:01.227
pretty good.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.262
Well, you guys want to see it?

21:03.296 --> 21:04.731
We're gonna have to do
a mad dash across town, though.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.265
It starts in 30 minutes.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.834
-To the sewers!
-To the sewers!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.636
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

21:09.669 --> 21:12.071
No, no, I meant like, let's
see it on that pirate website.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.840
-You think it's up already?
-Here, let me check.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.141
Yeah. We don't have
to go across town.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.909
-It's probably on the, uh...
-Yeah, it's free.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.511
We can stay here and watch it.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.979
-CHARLIE: That way it's free.
-Yep. It-it's on there.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.581
-CHARLIE: Oh!
-Put it-- Yeah.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.015
You want to watch it
on the phone?

21:23.049 --> 21:24.250
-CHARLIE: Oh, good.
-All right.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.085
Five tickets

21:26.118 --> 21:28.655

21:28.688 --> 21:30.690

22:19.439 --> 22:20.873

22:22.442 --> 22:24.811
"Week long rental.
Bed to be shared with owners."

22:24.844 --> 22:26.513
What kind of people do you think
you're gonna attract?

22:26.546 --> 22:28.581
Bohemians
with no sexual boundaries.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.983

22:31.017 --> 22:32.919

Look at
these hardwood floors!

22:46.933 --> 22:49.201
(upbeat music plays)

22:54.373 --> 22:56.576
You can't make people
like you,

22:56.609 --> 22:59.011
but if people
don't respect you,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.480
you can make 'em fear you.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.592
