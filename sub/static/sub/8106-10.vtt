WEBVTT

00:38.038 --> 00:39.330
Merry Christmas.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.833
And a happy go to hell.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.877
What's he doing here?
Is he with you?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.339
Detective Tritter and I...

00:49.466 --> 00:51.300
We worked out a deal.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.803
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.642
I told him I didn't write
those prescriptions.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.936
I spoke with the DA.

01:02.646 --> 01:06.816
He agreed to two months in a rehab
facility in exchange for a guilty plea.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.361
Get out of my office.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.446
No jail time.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.990
Right. So I should get
locked up in some place I don't belong

01:14.116 --> 01:16.451
in order to avoid getting locked up
in some other place I don't belong.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.370
I got you on forgery,
fraud, enough drugs to...

01:19.496 --> 01:20.955
No sanctions
to the medical board.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.415
And you get your car back

01:22.541 --> 01:25.126
and your bank accounts
and your precious tumor-ridden patients.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.086
I did this to help you.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.713
Next Christmas,
buy me a sweater.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.339
You punched out an employee!

01:30.466 --> 01:33.009
You nearly cut a little girl in half
because you were too strung out...

01:33.135 --> 01:34.427
I was in pain!

01:39.308 --> 01:40.933
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

01:41.059 --> 01:44.103
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.481
- But you just selfishly...
- Knock it off.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.692
Look, I don't care why
Dr. Wilson is doing this.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.237
And right now,
it makes no difference to you, either,

01:53.363 --> 01:56.949
'cause you need to deal with
the reality of your current situation.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.161
You want to stand on principle,
you end up in a cell.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.164
And you end up
never practicing medicine again.

02:04.708 --> 02:08.336
So you got two choices,
your principles or your life.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.971
Get out of my office.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.979
The DA put a clock
on the deal.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.273
You got three days to decide.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.070
House! Just give me a minute.
You're afraid of the pain.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.238
You're not?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.157
You can still have
pain meds in rehab.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.410
- Tramadol, gabapentin.
- Those don't work.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.537
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.665
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.417
Fine, run to Cuddy.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.670
You don't think
she's going to support me on this?

03:37.342 --> 03:41.679
Well, the stitches are healing nicely,
there's no sign of infection.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.972
Whoa.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.309
Sorry.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.437
Just need her
for a tiny moment.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.522
Small favor.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.941
Pills.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.276
Who's the wit?

03:55.402 --> 03:58.821
Doctor. Don't worry,
I'll be firing him soon.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.656
Wait in my office.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.868
Incision looks just big enough
for a chest tube.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.204
Collapsed lung?
Someone mistake you for a piÃ±ata?

04:07.331 --> 04:11.208
Delightful. Usually we just get
the elf jokes this time of year.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.544
No on trauma.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.713
Negative PPD.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.007
What flavor dwarfs
are you guys?

04:18.133 --> 04:21.510
My daughter and I both have
cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.137
Think you can make
a pun out of that?

04:23.263 --> 04:26.015
Yes. But I don't
want to be insensitive.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.518
She's got a bit
of a short fuse, doesn't she?

04:29.645 --> 04:31.395
It's a bleb. Wait in my office.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.481
Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.858
We'll schedule
an MRI to make sure,

04:35.984 --> 04:38.611
but a certain number of these cases
are idiopathic.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.155
Let me translate that
into Tolkien for you guys.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.782
It means Dr. Cuddy's
got no idea

04:42.908 --> 04:45.451
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped like a balloon.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.078
You think you do?

04:49.206 --> 04:51.707
Gimme her chart. And my pills.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.212
Santa needs us.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.717
Did you get that looked at?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.427
I'm fine.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.765
Great. I just admitted
a cartilage-hair hypoplasia dwarf.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.351
- Fifteen years old...
- What are you going to do?

05:10.477 --> 05:14.355
I thought I'd get your theories, mock
them, then embrace my own. The usual.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.440
Wilson told us he ratted.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.567
Your choice of verb,
I take it?

05:18.694 --> 05:23.489
It's appropriate. He betrayed you.
And you should take the deal.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.035
Unexplained lung collapse and anemia.
Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.122
"Cuddy" and "idiop" being
the relevant parts of that sentence.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.582
Well, I'd say TB,
but Cuddy's already ruled it out.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.584
Then you'd be just as big
an idiop as her.

05:35.711 --> 05:36.877
Don't you people know
your dwarfs?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.213
There are over 200 varieties
of dwarfism,

05:39.339 --> 05:40.881
each with different
medical complications.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.592
You can't expect us to be intimately
familiar with all of them?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.511
The sick dwarfs
sure expect you to.

05:45.637 --> 05:49.181
Cartilage-hair hypoplasia.
They have compromised immune systems.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.142
Gold star for Cameron.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.020
For extra credit, explain to
the special needs section of the class

05:54.146 --> 05:56.397
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.066
A PPD involves planting a fragment of TB
under the skin

05:59.192 --> 06:00.735
to see if the immune system
recognizes it.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.820
Because of
a compromised immune system,

06:02.946 --> 06:04.947
our patient could have TB
but not recognize it.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
The little people love you.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.160
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.124
Gallium
is a radioactive isotope.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.292
It travels through your veins,

06:16.418 --> 06:19.670
allowing us to see any bright spots
that might indicate infection.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.842
I'm 4'1".
That's 1.5 canes in metric.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.512
You don't look
a day over four feet.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.099
I saw in the file that her dad
was normal-sized.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.559
It's average-sized.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.062
Compared to you,
I'm sure it was huge.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.563
So did he have a fetish,

06:37.689 --> 06:40.524
or did he just fall in love
with your long-legged soul?

06:40.650 --> 06:43.944
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.447
Seems like you're the one
with the fetish.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.241
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.576
Did you stand on a table?

06:50.702 --> 06:51.619
House!

06:53.163 --> 06:55.873
Pretty much,
he'd lay flat and spin me.

06:55.999 --> 06:56.916
Mom.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.337
So, Abigail, you want to
hop up on the table for me?

07:02.631 --> 07:04.423
That's going to be tough.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.676
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me give you a boost.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.804
Stop treating her
like she's five.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.931
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.599
Mom, it's okay.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.102
I was just trying
to be helpful.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.438
She also hates Jews.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.565
I've dealt with worse.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.401
Being different,
you get used to people's idiocy.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.113
Still beats the hell out of
actually being an idiot.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.699
What?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.619
Care to go for a spin?

07:39.334 --> 07:40.793
What the hell
were you thinking?

07:40.919 --> 07:43.462
You didn't think ratting out
this hospital's best doctor

07:43.588 --> 07:45.506
merited checking
with your boss first?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.675
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.843
Which he'll never take.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.637
- He will if we...
- How long have you known House?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.430
Did you think
he'd suddenly become reasonable?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.683
I made the deal. It's done.
You can either keep yelling at me,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.476
or you can help me avoid
a complete disaster.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.187
It already is going to be
a complete disaster!

08:00.313 --> 08:03.065
He's not going to take the deal.
He's going to go to jail.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.317
Because he's a child,
he's too stubborn.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.778
When a child misbehaves,
what do you do?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.697
You take away something
he loves.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.198
We can't take away
his Vicodin.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.118
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.037
And we tell him the only way to get
the pills back is to take the deal.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.330
He won't be able to function.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.498
That's the point.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.876
You going to explain that
to his patient?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.504
What choice do we have?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.554
Gallium scan shows
no bright spots of any kind.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.514
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.642
There are no bright spots
'cause the whole thing's too bright.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.436
Except for the liver.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.480
The tech over-exposed
the image a bit, but it's nothing.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.773
The liver looks fine.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.609
Could be lung cancer.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.528
Tumor causes structural damage.
The lung caves in on itself.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.863
Also explains the anemia.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.656
Doesn't explain
the liver problem, though.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.034
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.702
Did you guys look at the liver
on this thing?

08:56.828 --> 08:57.953
There's no liver problem.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.538
Seriously, look at the liver.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.623
There's nothing there.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.624
Why not?

09:01.750 --> 09:02.791
Because there's nothing wrong?

09:02.918 --> 09:06.420
Every organ in this scan
is lit up like a hundred-watt bulb.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.798
Except for her liver,
which is hovering around 60 watts.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.593
And not one of them good 60-watters,
but an energy saving...

09:12.719 --> 09:15.387
You're saying her liver's shutting down
because the lighting is off?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.181
You just don't want
a cancer diagnosis,

09:17.307 --> 09:18.766
because then you'd have
to deal with Wilson.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.060
Lung cancer
is a lame diagnosis.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.520
Avoiding Wilson
is an added bonus.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.272
House, we need to talk.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.983
Not taking the deal.
Glad we talked.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.277
Ultrasound her liver.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.737
Sit down.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.405
Stand up.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.865
Your turn.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.700
House, you're off the case.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.577
Your treatment privileges
are suspended

09:38.703 --> 09:40.037
until you accept
Tritter's deal.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.538
Well, I'm obviously
not going to take the deal

09:41.665 --> 09:43.832
just so I can have the fun
of treating a dwarf.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.585
So, I assume
there's more to this threat.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.338
- I'm also cutting off your Vicodin.
- That could work.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.007
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.467
This is not lung cancer.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.637
We'll find out as soon as
we MRI her lungs.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.396
You're going to come begging me
to save this girl

10:05.522 --> 10:08.649
long before I come
begging you for pills.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.984
I hope not.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.111
For everyone's sake.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.954
This is wrong.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.374
Cutting House off?
It might not work, but it's not wrong.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.418
Bone windows look clean.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.839
Abigail, we need you
to hold still, okay?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.590
Can I come out?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.592
Just hang in there two more minutes,
and we'll be done.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.760
Okay.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.595
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.641
Cuddy's bending the rules
to get a patient to do the right thing.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.436
- Who would work for a doctor like that?
- And the ends justify the means?

10:45.562 --> 10:48.397
If the ends involve
us keeping our jobs, sure.

10:48.732 --> 10:53.110
Lung parenchyma's clean.
No masses, it's not lung cancer.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.905
Abigail, you okay?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.790
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.127
Endoscopy confirmed the vomiting
was caused by variceal bleeding.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.963
Blood work also confirms
House's hypothesis.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.258
I get it. House was right,
it's the liver. Let's move on.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.053
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.929
Schistosomiasis,
the parasite could have...

11:21.056 --> 11:22.514
There's no eosinophilia.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.809
- Cirrhosis could explain...
- Could be a hepatoma.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.438
She's 15.
It's not liver cancer.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.106
It's not unheard of.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.484
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is, what caused it?

11:33.610 --> 11:37.071
- Could be hepatitis, Budd-Chiari...
- Or drugs and alcohol.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.865
If anyone has reason to dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.241
I'll do a liver biopsy
to confirm.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.079
And I'll search the patient's home
for drugs and alcohol.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.707
Cameron, got a moment?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.175
What exactly
is your problem with me?

11:59.677 --> 12:01.220
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.138
So this is all about the case?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.182
What else would it be about?

12:07.185 --> 12:10.229
I made this deal to help him.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.439
And helped yourself
at the same time.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.275
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.445
I gave both of them up to help House
and I would have gone on without them,

12:18.571 --> 12:21.657
if he hadn't almost maimed that little
girl and if he hadn't punched out Chase.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.575
Was it an easy choice?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.953
Of course not. But it's right.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.955
Then why wasn't it easy?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.957
Because he's my friend.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.460
- It's obviously complicated...
- It's complicated?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.256
When you decided to talk to Tritter,
your life got a million times better.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.633
How do you separate that out?

12:39.759 --> 12:43.178
How do you pretend your windfall
isn't relevant to this decision?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.767
It was the right thing to do.

12:49.102 --> 12:53.188
You pretending your motives are pure
is why I have a problem.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.910
Where's Cuddy?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.455
In this drawer. It's a rescue mission.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.832
I've got it under control,
you can leave.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.586
You were right
about the liver failure,

13:15.712 --> 13:18.297
the patient had variceal bleeding,
which suggested cirrhosis, but...

13:18.423 --> 13:19.923
Off the clock.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.842
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.260
Obviously.

13:23.595 --> 13:28.348
Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis
but it showed sclerosing cholangitis.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.602
Even weirder, there's no increase
in alkaline phosphatase.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.980
Medical mystery. Sounds like
the kind of thing I'd be good at.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.403
Breaking and entering sounds like
the kind of thing you'd be good at.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.989
I take it that's where
Cuddy's been keeping your pills.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.284
One theory, one drawer.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.291
Really?

13:54.417 --> 13:57.002
I thought you'd be all for
this "torture House" plan.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.504
It works, therefore it's good.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.464
On the other hand, I don't want
to talk you out of this deal

14:00.590 --> 14:01.798
by pointing out
your hypocrisy.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.427
So, patient's life at stake,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.181
Forget about the specific nature of
the liver dysfunction, it's irrelevant.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.226
The dwarf's problem is global,
that's why the gallium scan was bright.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.937
And it's going to spread throughout
her entire body unless you stop it.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.232
If that were true, more than
her lungs and liver would be affected.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.483
It will be.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.153
It'll spread through the biliary tree
and hit her pancreas next.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.155
Stop retracing your steps,
get ahead of it.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.784
Forget the liver and focus
on the pancreas because after that...

14:28.910 --> 14:30.494
Actually, after that
it doesn't really matter what it hits

14:30.620 --> 14:34.122
because, pretty much,
all roads lead to a dead dwarf.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.043
I get why you
don't want to go to rehab.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.046
But only an idiot goes to prison
for being stubborn.

14:41.172 --> 14:45.259
Only an idiot stands between
Ahab and his whale. Move.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.688
Sorry.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.322
Santa's got gifts.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.034
Olive oil wasn't in the kitchen,
it was in the medicine cabinet.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.327
Home remedy
for ear infections.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.830
Ear infections are fairly typical
among CHH dwarfs.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.582
Or, it's a symptom.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.709
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.919
Or House is wrong
and it's a symptom.

15:21.629 --> 15:25.048
Laxatives. I don't think they were used
to maintain her girlish figure.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.883
Again, intestinal problems
are common.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.177
Again, it might be a symptom.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.972
Glucosamine
suggests chronic joint pain.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.017
Who ordered
an alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency test?

15:35.143 --> 15:36.226
I did.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.186
You think the problem's
in her pancreas?

15:38.313 --> 15:40.647
I think it will be. I think we need
to forget about the liver.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.775
We just forgot about the lungs,
now we need to forget about the liver?

15:43.901 --> 15:47.321
We need to stop retracing
our steps and get ahead of this thing.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.116
House, you've tanned.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.493
You don't think
I could have come up with this?

15:53.620 --> 15:54.953
Did you?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.456
You suspended House because
it'd be dangerous having him in charge,

15:57.582 --> 15:58.415
but getting his opinion?

15:58.541 --> 15:59.916
I'm sure he gave you that opinion

16:00.043 --> 16:02.169
simply because he was worried
about the patient?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.172
Just because House wants his pills,
doesn't mean his theory is wrong.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.717
No, the test results mean that.
Your test was negative.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.094
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.056
Do an ERCP to check the liver
for bile duct cancer.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.225
Just because it wasn't alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.853
You needed an organ,
he needed a fix.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.565
He'd have made up any story for a pill.
You didn't give him anything, did you?

16:23.691 --> 16:24.691
No.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.912
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.164
Unfortunately, that pain
and lack of bruising

16:39.290 --> 16:41.083
is typical of a zygomatic break.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.502
Sounds bad.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.712
Bones are aligned properly.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.297
Which ER did you go to
after the car accident?

16:47.423 --> 16:50.926
Princeton Plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.928
Okay.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.389
I'm going to get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.100
I tried that,
it makes me nauseous.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.561
There's a drug
called gabapentin

17:01.688 --> 17:03.355
which is good
for certain kinds of pain.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.982
Great!
'Cause I haven't slept in days.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.151
Gabapentin's not really
going to help with the sleep.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.236
Oh.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.698
Is there something else
you can give me?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.160
Vicodin's your best bet
with sleep issues.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.120
Well, thanks so much.

17:18.246 --> 17:22.332
Unfortunately, our policy forbids
prescribing opiates to new patients.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.293
Well, how could a clinic have a rule
against relieving pain?

17:25.420 --> 17:28.338
Just with opiates. We find that it helps
weed out drug-seekers.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.841
- You think I'm a drug-seeker?
- I'm not saying that.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.968
- Well, then give me the Vicodin.
- I can't.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.428
Because you think
I'm a drug-seeker.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.637
I just said I didn't.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.141
No, you said that the policy
was to stop drug-seeking.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.977
Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.895
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.565
Gabapentin works on
nerve damage.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.316
You're prescribing it
for a broken face.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.736
Might as well hand out Band-Aids
for a severed carotid.

17:50.862 --> 17:51.903
You're a doctor.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.364
Not by this clinic's definition,
since I'm neither a moron,

17:54.490 --> 17:56.074
nor a mindless drone!

17:56.576 --> 17:58.326
- Security.
- Forget it.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.287
I'll throw myself out.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.295
That tube is going
all the way down to my liver?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.714
Don't worry,
you'll be sedated.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.632
Sometimes doctors
have to do things

18:12.759 --> 18:14.968
that make people uncomfortable
to help them.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.596
But we always want to respect
the patient's wishes

18:17.722 --> 18:20.390
and not shove things down
their throats.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.935
Foreman.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.397
You haven't given
her the sedative.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.482
No.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.150
Abigail.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.944
Abigail.
She's unconscious.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.572
Check her airway.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.450
Airway's clear.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.035
Her breath smells fruity.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.245
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.873
Hang an insulin drip
at.1 mgs per kg per hour!

18:44.999 --> 18:48.335
Her pancreas is failing.
You ready to call House yet?

18:56.302 --> 18:59.513
You were right.
The patient's pancreas is failing.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.723
Told you you'd come
begging me for help.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.142
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.188
Give me my pills
or lose an arm.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.106
- The girl is dying!
- So give me my pills.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.150
Take the deal and I will.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.780
You'd rather kill this girl
than give me my pills?

19:17.907 --> 19:20.283
I would rather lose
one patient now

19:20.409 --> 19:22.994
than the dozens we will lose
while you're in prison.

19:25.289 --> 19:29.459
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy grieving mother.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.134
What if we sacrifice this girl
and House still goes to jail?

19:38.261 --> 19:40.720
I'd feel bad.
Can we get on with this?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.597
House correctly predicted
the spread,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.391
means we've got
a global systemic illness

19:44.517 --> 19:47.727
affecting lungs, liver and pancreas.
So far. Ideas?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.981
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ systems.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.024
Histiocytosis usually
starts in the brain,

19:53.150 --> 19:54.442
then moves to the internal organs.

19:54.569 --> 19:57.153
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.572
Exocrine function's normal.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.782
Hodgkin's lymphoma.
It's a systemic cancer,

20:00.908 --> 20:02.284
which her dwarfism predisposes her to.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.536
- You have any ideas that aren't cancer?
- Cancer fits.

20:04.662 --> 20:05.662
Autoimmune fits better.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.038
We should treat her
with prednisone for lupus.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.249
That'll spike her blood sugar
and put her back in a coma.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.293
It's much safer just to run
a double-stranded DNA test.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.087
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.505
One of you is probably right.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.799
Why don't we hold the sniping
until we find out which?

20:17.925 --> 20:22.387
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma,
you guys run an antibody test for lupus.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.771
Because of your daughter's dwarfism,
we've had to pick a higher entry point

20:31.898 --> 20:33.899
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.067
So, why not do
the lupus test first?

20:36.193 --> 20:40.071
In the interest of time, we think
it's best to proceed on both fronts.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.532
You have no idea
what's wrong with my daughter.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.577
- We have several theories.
- What does Dr. House think?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.996
He's... He had to
go home sick.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.706
My daughter may be dying

20:49.832 --> 20:52.125
- and he's gone home with the sniffles?
- Well, he's not...

20:52.251 --> 20:55.462
He was the only one who seemed to have
any idea what was wrong with her.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.797
He better be
really damn sick.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.090
He is.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.181
Unless you've got Vicodin,
go away.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.309
House, it's me, I...

21:12.355 --> 21:13.647
Oh, God.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.817
- I don't have...
- No pills?

21:18.527 --> 21:19.861
No eggnog.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.199
What happened to your arm?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.576
Cut myself.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.708
Wilson was wrong
about lymphoma.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.003
Kid's not losing any weight,
no night sweats.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.964
- Cuddy sent you?
- No.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.633
She doesn't trust me
not to give you pills.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.094
Is she right?

21:44.220 --> 21:47.222
House, these cuts
are straight, in a row.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.933
You did this on purpose.

21:52.561 --> 21:56.022
Cutting releases endorphins,
endorphins relieve pain.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.733
You going to get me
some pills?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.860
No.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.154
Well, then you can leave.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.949
No constitutional
symptoms means...

22:06.075 --> 22:09.744
As soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.497
You really think
she's going to fold?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.714
Autoimmune fits better
than cancer.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.176
But lupus loves kidneys.
Usually attacks them first.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.886
Kidneys are fine, right?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.138
Yeah.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.639
House,

22:30.725 --> 22:31.850
take the deal.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.518
You can survive
without Vicodin.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.563
After you were shot,
you stayed clean for months.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.647
Yeah.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.066
I wonder if it had something
to do with the absence of pain.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.528
Leave that. I want to be able to pour
alcohol on it so I can distract myself.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.156
Then you can rip off
the bandage.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.038
Kid been sick lately?

22:53.164 --> 22:55.081
There's a history
of ear infections.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.670
See, Abigail's immune system

23:02.173 --> 23:03.965
is like a shy guy in a bar.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.887
The ear infections, they come in
and they try to coax him to...

23:12.349 --> 23:13.892
To hell with the metaphor.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.268
You get the point, right?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.937
Nerd gets drunk,
trashes the bar.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.107
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by a minor infection?

23:21.233 --> 23:24.277
Factor in her age,
elevated sed rate, anemia...

23:25.446 --> 23:27.405
It's Still's disease.

23:27.907 --> 23:31.076
We start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.828
House.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.247
Stop this.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.500
Please.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.526
- What'd he say?
- Still's disease.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.527
It's chronic,
but manageable...

24:05.653 --> 24:07.862
A diagnosis
that's virtually unconfirmable

24:07.988 --> 24:09.280
and with a treatment
that's more dangerous

24:09.406 --> 24:12.575
than what we were considering for lupus.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.452
How bad is he?

24:14.578 --> 24:15.703
Are you asking
because you care

24:15.830 --> 24:18.915
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

24:19.041 --> 24:19.958
Both.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.627
He's detoxing. In agony.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.505
He's started cutting himself.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.384
But he's still House.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.972
I'll order the treatment.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.620
Your plan isn't working.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.914
Two days down, one to go.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.918
Figured I'd show you
how much it isn't working.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.422
Yeah. Clearly, the drugs
have no hold on you.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.884
We both know that my pride

25:11.010 --> 25:13.928
far surpasses my instinct
for self-preservation.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.890
You want to redeem yourself?
Give up now.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.850
And you'll go to jail.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.144
I've done nothing wrong.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.146
And you'll go to jail.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.775
Which makes this your last chance
to do me a kindness

25:27.902 --> 25:30.236
before ruining my life
forever.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.574
Nausea's bad this time.

25:37.620 --> 25:42.498
You can write me a scrip
for metoclopramide so I can stop puking.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.751
They'd give me that in rehab.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.588
Then you should go to rehab.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.423
I have a patient.

26:07.191 --> 26:11.486
I'm so sorry, I know it's little
solace, but he went without pain...

26:15.574 --> 26:16.741
House?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.577
Well, look on the bright side.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.997
At least you don't have to go
by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.750
That's got to be a relief.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.294
- You know this man?
- I'm sorry, he's sick...

26:28.420 --> 26:32.298
You hear my diagnosis on the dwarf?
Still's disease.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.384
Did you even consider
those ear infections,

26:34.510 --> 26:37.262
or you just wrote it off
as a dwarf thing?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.554
Are you sure he's dead?

26:38.681 --> 26:40.640
Because Dr. Wilson
sometimes misses things.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.976
Trying to embarrass me
in front of a grieving widow

26:43.102 --> 26:45.812
- crosses lines that even...
- Right. I'm pathetic.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.399
I'm strung out, I haven't slept,
puking every hour,

26:49.525 --> 26:51.234
and I still out-diagnosed you.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.652
But I'm supposed to let you
decide what's best...

26:52.778 --> 26:53.778
Please.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.198
Please leave.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.493
Sorry.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.912
I'm done.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.749
House!

27:11.255 --> 27:12.672
You didn't come in here
just to embarrass me,

27:12.798 --> 27:14.507
you can do that any time.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.847
Stealing Oxy from a dead man.
Yeah. You don't have a problem.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.529
How's the girl?

27:36.655 --> 27:37.864
Much better.

27:39.742 --> 27:40.867
House was right.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.368
It happens.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.872
I thought
we could handle this.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.333
Still's disease
never crossed my mind.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.752
Don't beat yourself up,
I didn't get it, either.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.309
I feel like a mob informant.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.773
You want to go inside?
Got a cafeteria in there, right?

28:12.649 --> 28:14.150
I can't testify.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.906
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.534
House has hurt plenty of people.
You included.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.871
He saves lives.
People that no one else can save.

28:27.581 --> 28:30.750
And, no matter how much
of an ass he is,

28:30.918 --> 28:34.504
statistically, House
is a positive force in the universe.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.757
Pills let him do that.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.302
Vicodin does not make House
a genius.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.972
Whatever he does on the pills,
he can do off.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.809
He is just not willing to try.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.021
I won't testify against him.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.983
Then we'll subpoena you.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.237
Your previous statement
will be read into evidence

28:59.363 --> 29:03.157
and you'll be charged with
interfering with an investigation.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.411
And you will go to jail.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.168
Again, statistically,

29:14.795 --> 29:16.212
better me than him.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.924
Statistically, the two of you
will be in jail.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.170
Dr. Cameron?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.380
Come quick,
there's something wrong with Abby.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.632
It can't be too severe,
her cardiac alarm didn't go off.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.093
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.724
Picking up a scrip
under Zebalusky.

30:15.689 --> 30:18.649
This is Dr. Wilson's patient.

30:18.775 --> 30:22.111
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.

30:22.237 --> 30:27.033
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying in agony
on account of his metastatic lung cancer

30:27.159 --> 30:29.160
and not having the pills
to relieve that agony

30:29.286 --> 30:31.996
because of some
moron pharmacist.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.999
Sign the book.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.948
The bleeding wasn't a ruptured eardrum,
ear infection or bleeding disorder.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.075
Her heart rate's climbing,
blood pressure's dropping,

31:09.201 --> 31:11.994
she's on the verge
of a multi-system failure.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.914
Head CT was clean, means it's not
a neurological problem.

31:15.040 --> 31:15.998
Basically we have nothing.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.750
The cancer's
still on the table.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.919
Spinal fluid
was negative for lymphoma.

31:20.045 --> 31:20.962
- What other...
- Leukemia.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.380
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.298
None of the blood tests
suggest leukemia.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.175
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.761
Unless a small clot
led to a pulmonary infarct.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.721
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.848
Autoimmune diseases respond to steroids,
which we've given her.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.892
And she got better for a while,
we stopped the treatment too soon.

31:35.018 --> 31:35.893
Because she crashed.

31:36.019 --> 31:40.565
All we're doing is bouncing back
and forth between cancer and autoimmune.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.025
We're going in circles.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.158
Give me half an hour.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.711
Can I have a French fry?

32:03.422 --> 32:04.505
Get your own.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.757
You took the last ones.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.135
What's wrong with you?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.554
I've got spinal
muscular atrophy.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.725
I guess it's not contagious.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.519
Nice bear.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.146
It's a dog.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.815
House, it's not Still's.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.317
Steroids helped

32:24.443 --> 32:27.445
until the patient started bleeding
from the ears and mouth.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.572
It's a bear.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.033
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.202
You win, you can have Vicodin.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.289
Words have set meanings
for a reason.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.666
If you see an animal like Bill
and you try to play fetch,

32:40.792 --> 32:41.959
Bill's going to eat you.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.294
Because Bill's a bear.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.962
Are you on something?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.674
You got your hands
on pain meds.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.802
Bill has fur,
four legs, and a collar.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.763
He's a dog.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.806
It's between cancer
and autoimmune.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.392
See, that's what we call
a faulty syllogism.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.937
Just because you call Bill
a dog, doesn't mean that he is

33:03.690 --> 33:04.940
a dog.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.032
We got to x-ray
our patient's leg.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.162
Her leg looks fine.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.705
Weird, huh?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.332
Why aren't you detoxing?

33:21.458 --> 33:22.875
Willpower.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.460
What... What...

33:24.586 --> 33:27.421
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.382
Did you just take a pill?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.758
No.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.595
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal growth plates?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.515
It's impossible.
We must be missing something.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.517
How many pills have you taken?

33:39.643 --> 33:41.310
Not nearly as many
as I'm going to take.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.938
I'd forgotten how delicious
they were.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.314
I didn't give them to him.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.858
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

33:47.984 --> 33:49.235
We were missing the fact that

33:49.361 --> 33:52.530
just because we called her
a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.573
Everyone assumed she was,
because of her mother.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.450
There's no test
for CHH dwarfism,

33:56.576 --> 33:59.954
so she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.124
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism,

34:03.250 --> 34:07.837
then her short stature must be
caused by a growth hormone deficiency.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.630
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland

34:09.756 --> 34:11.590
and based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.719
So what connects
a long-term pituitary issue

34:14.845 --> 34:17.888
with problems in the lungs,
liver and pancreas?

34:18.014 --> 34:21.642
You guys and your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.436
Obviously, you think
it's something else.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.230
Nope. I think it's both.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.691
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

34:28.817 --> 34:29.942
Also known as,

34:30.068 --> 34:33.028
"You got your cancer
in my autoimmune" disease.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.322
The immune component responded
to the Still's treatment,

34:35.449 --> 34:38.159
led to the short-term improvement.
The cancer portion didn't.

34:38.285 --> 34:41.036
We dismissed this earlier, because
there were no neurological symptoms.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.581
Yeah. It's not your fault.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.459
The only neurological symptom
was her height.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.043
Who could have noticed?

34:57.971 --> 34:59.889
This is your pituitary gland.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.600
This is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

35:02.726 --> 35:07.062
No pituitary equals no growth hormone,
equals about that much.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.690
She's not a dwarf?

35:09.816 --> 35:11.901
Just hormonally challenged.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.861
What about my mom?

35:13.987 --> 35:17.740
Your mom's the real deal.
But you're just a tiny little poseur.

35:17.908 --> 35:20.201
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

35:20.327 --> 35:22.787
a cascade of the same cells
that made the granuloma.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.830
They attacked your lungs,
moved on to your liver,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.041
then hitched a ride over
to your pancreas.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.918
We can nuke them
with a mild course of chemo

35:29.044 --> 35:31.337
and then remove the granuloma.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.714
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

35:35.467 --> 35:38.219
Well, let me see
if I can make this clear.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.638
This pill represents

35:41.556 --> 35:42.848
a pill.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.851
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.480
We deposit the pill
in the mouth.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.613
You may never be tall enough
to play in the WNBA,

35:57.739 --> 36:01.075
but you should be able to
post up your mom, no problem.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.536
What if I
don't take the pills?

36:04.287 --> 36:07.540
What if you remove the thing in my head
and give me the chemo,

36:07.666 --> 36:10.543
but not the pills?
Would I still get better?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.170
Your body needs growth hormone
for lots of things.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.588
Like

36:14.714 --> 36:15.840
to grow.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.716
I like who I am now.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.636
Nobody your age
likes who they are now.

36:20.762 --> 36:21.720
I do.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.059
You like needing help when
you want something off a high shelf?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.562
Not being able to press an
elevator button above the eighth floor?

36:29.688 --> 36:32.439
Having to smell ass
every time you stand in line?

36:32.566 --> 36:34.358
You don't need growth hormone.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.486
It's just your ticket
out of the freak show.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.877
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

36:53.003 --> 36:55.337
without making her feel
that her life isn't worth living?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.839
I'm trying to help her.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.425
You're trying
to make her taller.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.968
Not too tall.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.804
Just tall enough
to wipe her own butt.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.517
Are you high?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.185
Higher than you.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.355
If my daughter doesn't want
to choose the easy path,

37:13.481 --> 37:14.481
I won't force her to.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.650
Then you're a lousy mom.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.277
You want your daughter
to be a freak.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.112
We're not freaks.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.615
You want her to overcome
adversity.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.867
- Yes.
- Then why stop at height?

37:24.993 --> 37:28.245
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interesting she'll be then.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.955
Being little
is not the same as...

37:30.081 --> 37:33.250
You and I have found out
that being normal sucks.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.461
Because we're freaks.

37:35.879 --> 37:39.423
The advantage of being a freak
is it makes you stronger.

37:39.549 --> 37:42.760
Now, how strong
do you really want her to have to be?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.723
You told her
what you had to tell her.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.642
Now you tell her you lied.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.604
Even if you didn't.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.155
This is who
you were supposed to be.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.823
You hate normal.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.910
It's not that simple.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.956
If I grow,
I'll fade into the background.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.457
I'll be boring.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.587
We'll get you a funny hat.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.718
You could never be boring.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.555
You want me
to be like everybody else?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.146
I want you to have
what I can't.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.958
Abigail agreed...

38:56.543 --> 38:59.128
Abigail agreed
to take growth hormone.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.879
Who's Abigail?

39:01.423 --> 39:03.507
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

39:03.633 --> 39:04.717
Good.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.304
Then the growth hormone
makes sense.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.682
Christmas Eve.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.225
Yeah, I know.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.602
Deal expires tomorrow.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.813
You have plans for tonight?

39:17.939 --> 39:20.190
You worried I'm going to be
popping more pills?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.486
Thought you might prefer
people over pills.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.017
Hey, Mom.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.521
I guess you guys are already up
at Aunt Sarah's.

40:01.441 --> 40:02.691
I'm sure Dad's in the eggnog

40:02.817 --> 40:06.779
and you're probably suffering
through another dried-out turkey.

40:14.287 --> 40:17.289
I just wanted to say,
"Merry Christmas."

40:44.943 --> 40:46.235
House?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.988
Are you okay?
I called three times.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.523
I'm ready to take the deal.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.359
Well, that's off the table.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.907
- The clock doesn't expire until...
- Got new evidence.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.117
We don't need Wilson anymore.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.120
Thing about addicts is,

42:21.748 --> 42:23.957
no matter how smart they are,

42:24.417 --> 42:27.294
they are dumb
when it comes to drugs.

42:27.837 --> 42:30.714
So, I've been keeping an eye
on the pharmacy log.

42:31.424 --> 42:34.968
Seems some patient of Wilson's
named Zebalusky,

42:35.428 --> 42:40.390
managed to pick up his Oxy prescription
after he died.

42:48.483 --> 42:49.900
Jesus walks, huh?

42:58.159 --> 42:59.743
Merry Christmas.
