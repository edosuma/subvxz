"Something dark is growing inside me.

00:05.490 --> 00:07.346
When I watch him with her,

00:07.352 --> 00:09.793
acting like we never existed, I feel it.

00:10.936 --> 00:13.969
That's... the thing that hurts the most.

00:15.139 --> 00:17.587
The fact he's turned me into someone...

00:17.822 --> 00:19.432
I don't recognize.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.891
Someone eaten up by hate."

00:44.009 --> 00:45.384
Hey, space cadet!

00:46.186 --> 00:47.426
Your speech was awesome.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.538
No, it was hypocritical bullshit.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.264
Look at us, Will,

00:52.582 --> 00:55.742
we go to one of the most
expensive schools in Europe.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.577
Capitalism hasn't failed us.

00:58.754 --> 01:01.178
It's... empty rhetoric.

01:01.704 --> 01:03.113
Just words.

01:03.378 --> 01:04.674
You love words.

01:04.794 --> 01:06.098
What's up with you?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.415
Coach sick.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.828
Well, don't go baffing on me, Karl Marx.

01:13.063 --> 01:14.936
You wanna take a photo?

01:16.816 --> 01:18.423
Leave it, baby.

01:48.783 --> 01:49.933
Mr. Lorcan?

01:50.275 --> 01:51.612
What's going on, sir?

01:52.531 --> 01:54.822
Mr. Arn, why have we stopped?

01:58.021 --> 01:59.266
_

02:06.535 --> 02:08.068
Quiet, everybody.

02:09.499 --> 02:12.117
Shut the fuck up!

02:12.183 --> 02:15.831
My friends out there will shoot
anyone who tries to escape.

02:15.877 --> 02:18.669
Mr. Lorcan here is going
to collect your phones.

02:19.041 --> 02:21.180
Don't try playing the hero.

02:21.216 --> 02:22.170
Move!

02:24.202 --> 02:26.957
All right everybody, just stay calm.

02:31.662 --> 02:32.960
Where's the girl?

02:35.776 --> 02:37.192
Where is Chloe?

03:08.278 --> 03:09.640
Are you with the ICC?

03:09.650 --> 03:12.401
I'm Michel Dorn. I'm the
chief prosecutor of the court.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.266
Inspector Strand, this
is Inspector Costante.

03:14.285 --> 03:17.221
- Madam Ambassador.
- She tried to contact me from the coach.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.108
Just tell him we'll give
him whatever he wants.

03:19.131 --> 03:21.178
It's not in his interest
to hurt your daughter, OK?

03:21.196 --> 03:22.960
We'll do everything we
can to keep her safe.

03:23.823 --> 03:24.980
Inspector.

03:27.589 --> 03:30.000
This is Inspector Costante of the ICC.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.915
Who am I speaking to, please?

03:32.542 --> 03:33.976
He says he's going to kill us.

03:34.607 --> 03:35.900
What's your name, sweetheart?

03:36.020 --> 03:36.838
Chloe.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.127
Hey Chloe, I'm Marco.

03:39.161 --> 03:41.425
I'm here to make sure everybody stays safe.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.488
And I promise I'll do everything I can, OK?

03:44.779 --> 03:46.276
Do you trust me, Chloe?

03:46.553 --> 03:47.487
Yes.

03:47.516 --> 03:48.337
Good.

03:48.532 --> 03:49.956
You're being very brave.

03:50.076 --> 03:51.336
Now listen,

03:51.520 --> 03:53.445
if you can tell whoever's there

03:53.639 --> 03:55.535
this would be much better

03:55.655 --> 03:57.251
if we could speak directly.

03:58.431 --> 04:00.429
What took you so long?

04:00.463 --> 04:03.098
I've travelled from
Holland to be here, sir.

04:03.428 --> 04:05.115
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

04:05.125 --> 04:07.084
One million Euros.

04:07.204 --> 04:08.163
Cash.

04:08.283 --> 04:11.604
For each of the hostages, or
I start blowing brains out.

04:12.105 --> 04:15.386
OK, it's going to take a
little time to get you that sum.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.935
You're stalling.

04:16.969 --> 04:19.629
Look, 15 million Euros is a lot of money.

04:19.652 --> 04:20.444
I've spoken to the bank,

04:20.459 --> 04:22.588
I can get the money
within a matter of hours.

04:22.597 --> 04:23.633
Listen to me,

04:23.637 --> 04:25.703
you'll get your money, OK?

04:28.868 --> 04:30.238
Sir, are you there?

04:35.702 --> 04:36.893
Get in there!

04:37.013 --> 04:38.201
Go!

05:47.178 --> 05:48.117
No.

05:48.491 --> 05:49.604
No.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.393
No, no, no...

05:58.653 --> 06:01.550
We,ah, think the gunman
escaped via the drains.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.752
The police are sending some men down now.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.139
"What's your name, sweetheart?"

06:24.158 --> 06:25.524
"What's your name, sweetheart?"

06:25.913 --> 06:26.977
Chloe.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.155
"Do you trust me Chloe?"

06:29.179 --> 06:30.462
"Do you trust me Chloe?"

06:30.482 --> 06:31.503
Yes.

06:33.383 --> 06:35.945
_

06:35.946 --> 06:38.414
_

06:39.007 --> 06:40.286
I should have noticed,

06:40.295 --> 06:42.167
Arn was taking a different route.

06:43.819 --> 06:46.857
I didn't even realise we
pulled off the main road,

06:46.881 --> 06:48.558
until we were in the tunnel.

06:48.957 --> 06:51.591
The guy was talking some other language,

06:51.606 --> 06:52.860
I didn't understand.

06:53.031 --> 06:56.229
He was communicating with his accomplices

06:56.238 --> 06:58.304
on the radio. They could have been Russian,

06:58.424 --> 06:59.695
or Polish.

07:00.230 --> 07:02.349
Could you see them from the coach?

07:02.469 --> 07:05.027
I saw them outside the window,
they were speaking Czech.

07:06.495 --> 07:08.177
I have a Czech mate.

07:09.616 --> 07:11.705
Chloe was sitting right next to me.

07:12.502 --> 07:14.243
But she went to the
bathroom when it happened,

07:14.248 --> 07:15.720
she got coach sick.

07:15.754 --> 07:17.222
How did Arn know

07:17.270 --> 07:20.119
- that she had gone?
- He asked me.

07:22.203 --> 07:24.637
He smashed on the door,
and dragged her out.

07:24.638 --> 07:26.952
- She was screaming.
- He brought

07:26.967 --> 07:28.449
Chloe to the front,

07:28.921 --> 07:30.384
put a gun to her head,

07:30.428 --> 07:32.328
got her to call the police,

07:32.577 --> 07:33.850
and we waited.

07:34.064 --> 07:35.969
I had no clue

07:36.319 --> 07:38.681
- Theo was gonna do that.
- Theo?

07:39.147 --> 07:40.907
So, you know him well?

07:40.912 --> 07:42.997
He used to drive us to all our games.

07:43.298 --> 07:44.402
I thought he was a good guy.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.385
Turns out he's a fucking psychopath.

07:46.745 --> 07:49.020
He started shooting at us.

07:50.623 --> 07:52.796
Everyone was freaking out.

07:52.855 --> 07:54.318
I got to my feet,

07:54.352 --> 07:55.786
I wasn't thinking, I...

07:55.906 --> 07:58.270
wanted to get the gun
from him, to stop him.

07:58.319 --> 07:59.621
I swear

08:00.244 --> 08:02.446
if Lorcan hadn't put a bullet in him,

08:03.068 --> 08:04.307
I would have.

08:04.352 --> 08:06.286
I just wanted to save her.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.141
I couldn't.

08:14.296 --> 08:16.785
Displaced bone fragments
at the scene suggest

08:16.804 --> 08:19.293
the shot was fired from close range.

08:19.531 --> 08:20.882
Now...

08:21.134 --> 08:23.915
the headmaster, Lorcan, said that Chloe

08:23.944 --> 08:25.460
was next to the driver, and that he,

08:25.480 --> 08:27.036
Lorcan, he heard the shot.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.470
And then he

08:28.543 --> 08:31.206
lunged at the driver and wrestled the gun.

08:31.236 --> 08:32.966
Which was a SIG Sauer, it's, ah,

08:32.991 --> 08:34.668
commonly used by the Swiss military.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.628
This bus driver, Arn,
his money was coming. Why

08:37.667 --> 08:38.639
shoot her then?

08:38.649 --> 08:41.491
Yes. And everyone said
that Chloe didn't move,

08:41.491 --> 08:42.808
she didn't make a sound.

08:42.818 --> 08:45.161
That kid, Will Harrigan, he said,

08:45.516 --> 08:49.064
Arn asked for Chloe by
name, which surprised him.

08:49.077 --> 08:51.514
I think we need to find out as
much as we can about this driver.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.065
Arabela and Ellie are on it.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.233
If he was in it for...
for the money, why...

08:55.272 --> 08:57.046
why jeopardize his own plan?

08:57.542 --> 08:58.961
What else would he have wanted?

08:58.995 --> 09:00.031
I don't know.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.132
But... but this wasn't about a ransom.

09:07.376 --> 09:09.986
I think Chloe was murdered
for another reason.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.879
OK, let's work through it again.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.014
Madam Ambassador.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.908
I apologize. I wasn't
aware that you were here.

09:24.573 --> 09:26.604
But I can assure you that we are doing

09:26.605 --> 09:28.044
everything in our power

09:28.432 --> 09:30.858
to bring those responsible to justice.

09:33.410 --> 09:34.581
May I have a word?

09:35.995 --> 09:38.941
Madam Ambassador, I'm... I'm
sorry I have to ask you this, but,

09:39.179 --> 09:40.540
do you know of anyone

09:40.564 --> 09:42.231
who might have wanted to hurt Chloe?

09:42.431 --> 09:43.933
Who would want to hurt her?

09:44.439 --> 09:46.179
I believe she may have been targeted.

09:46.299 --> 09:47.506
What do you mean?

09:47.822 --> 09:50.656
The driver noticed your
daughter had left her seat.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.653
And... and asked for her by name.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.707
- There were 15 students in that coach.
- Exactly! Why single her out?

09:57.193 --> 09:58.437
Madam Ambassador,

09:58.451 --> 10:01.878
I've conducted dozens of
hostage negotiations, and...

10:01.903 --> 10:04.965
and n-none of them has
ever played out like this.

10:05.427 --> 10:08.314
So, you think it's plausible
that this was some kind of

10:08.342 --> 10:10.760
assassination of my 17 year-old daughter?

10:10.771 --> 10:11.973
It's ludicrous!

10:12.036 --> 10:13.888
You bangled the negociation

10:13.903 --> 10:15.556
and now you're reaching for far-fetched

10:15.565 --> 10:17.753
explanations to assuage your guilt!

10:25.845 --> 10:28.257
You truly believe the girl was targeted?

10:28.312 --> 10:29.709
What else could it be?

10:30.384 --> 10:31.812
Well, certainly

10:31.932 --> 10:33.702
nothing you said or did

10:33.732 --> 10:36.187
could have provoke that
driver to pull the trigger.

10:36.448 --> 10:37.579
Nothing.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.163
What have you got?

10:43.353 --> 10:45.485
Turns out our driver, Theo Arn

10:45.510 --> 10:47.375
has been hiding a prison record.

10:47.430 --> 10:48.900
Minor drug charges.

10:49.179 --> 10:51.858
So much for school CID
check. What about the...

10:51.901 --> 10:52.910
the car in the tunnel?

10:52.921 --> 10:55.243
Stolen from a car park
in Geneva two days ago.

10:55.244 --> 10:56.805
We're checking CCTV.

10:57.508 --> 10:58.832
What's wrong?

10:58.869 --> 11:00.735
- I need to get to the airport.
- Where are you going?

11:00.741 --> 11:02.145
Back to school.

11:09.479 --> 11:10.749
Stop.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.805
You're going to fall and break your neck,

11:13.835 --> 11:15.931
then what would I say to your father?

11:16.416 --> 11:17.905
I'll take those.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.867
- Put your hand on my shoulder.
- Thank you.

11:22.669 --> 11:23.854
Thanks.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.637
Where is Inspector Costante?

11:26.660 --> 11:30.087
I'm not 100% clear on his
whereabouts to be honest.

11:30.366 --> 11:32.517
- And the others?
- They are tracking the gunman.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.463
Carine and Sebastian are
trolling through CCTV footage,

11:35.477 --> 11:37.519
Luke and Arabela are
checking Border Control.

11:37.723 --> 11:39.166
And you're left here

11:39.356 --> 11:40.780
guarding the fort.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.712
Yes. I am researching Swiss law.

11:43.727 --> 11:45.691
And the access to police in schools.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.193
But you would rather be

11:47.222 --> 11:49.394
in the field with the
others, would you not?

11:49.608 --> 11:50.682
It's OK.

11:55.008 --> 11:56.170
Costante.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.365
I'm gonna need...

11:57.389 --> 12:00.680
access to Lausanne International College.

12:01.001 --> 12:02.843
Would you sanction my investigation?

12:02.858 --> 12:04.112
Oh, you're going to be

12:04.126 --> 12:06.717
knocking on doors at the school, so

12:07.292 --> 12:08.813
you should have someone

12:08.857 --> 12:11.778
by your side, who speaks
the local language.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.860
- Swiss French?
- No.

12:15.395 --> 12:17.708
The language of the rarified.

12:17.767 --> 12:20.679
- Are you offering to come with me?
- No.

12:20.868 --> 12:24.100
I had in mind someone considerably younger.

12:26.088 --> 12:28.611
- Miss Schadenfreude.
- Precisely.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.797
OK, send her over.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.886
You're going to need to put on your shoes.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.690
He wants me with him?

12:40.219 --> 12:41.940
Get your shoes on.

12:44.413 --> 12:45.993
You have my phone number?

12:46.052 --> 12:47.894
- Of course.
- Good.

12:52.459 --> 12:55.047
_

12:55.048 --> 12:57.835
_

13:38.362 --> 13:39.562
Thanks

13:43.973 --> 13:46.033
I just wanted to say, I really appreciate

13:46.034 --> 13:48.119
- you giving me this opportunity.
- I didn't.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.490
Well, I suppose, you're used to all this.

13:54.405 --> 13:57.103
Well, my boarding school
wasn't in this league.

13:57.317 --> 13:58.600
Where'd you go to school?

13:59.393 --> 14:02.212
Somewhere with fewer lakes,
you wouldn't have lasted a week.

14:02.921 --> 14:05.186
Well, teenagers are cruel wherever you go.

14:05.449 --> 14:06.596
And besides,

14:06.927 --> 14:08.871
You had a luxuary that I didn't.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.539
You got to go home at the end of the day.

14:20.891 --> 14:22.563
We are here to celebrate

14:22.587 --> 14:24.360
the life of Chloe Hanbury,

14:25.110 --> 14:27.268
who departed so suddenly

14:27.321 --> 14:29.916
and who has now joined our Lord in Heaven.

14:30.923 --> 14:33.757
Let us take a few moments to remember her.

14:40.441 --> 14:42.356
Is there anything I'm looking for?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.062
In particular, I mean.

14:45.463 --> 14:48.443
You know, collective trauma can
have a profound psychological effect

14:48.448 --> 14:50.236
on an institute such as this.

14:52.661 --> 14:54.440
We're all reeling

14:54.484 --> 14:56.642
from these tragic events.

14:58.193 --> 14:59.903
But here at Lausanne,

14:59.904 --> 15:02.203
we consider ourselves to be a family.

15:02.655 --> 15:04.035
And as a family,

15:04.055 --> 15:06.885
we acknowledge the great
importance of Chloe's life,

15:07.005 --> 15:08.396
and the loss to us all

15:08.435 --> 15:10.277
that her passing brings.

15:10.675 --> 15:14.194
If some of her friends have a
few words they'd like to share.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.734
Chloe,

15:26.633 --> 15:28.315
I can't believe you're gone.

15:28.835 --> 15:31.125
You were a beautiful person.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.409
So full of life

15:33.609 --> 15:34.941
and laughter.

15:35.189 --> 15:36.423
We,

15:36.705 --> 15:37.935
your friends,

15:39.597 --> 15:41.683
are going to miss you so much.

15:54.205 --> 15:55.405
Will?

15:57.076 --> 15:58.398
You don't have to hide that.

16:00.435 --> 16:01.641
Why did you leave?

16:02.064 --> 16:04.387
I thought you were friends
with Chloe, weren't you?

16:04.576 --> 16:05.913
Her only friend.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.513
Those people in there

16:09.713 --> 16:12.703
they didn't give a shit about
Chloe when she was alive.

16:13.135 --> 16:14.686
What about Arn?

16:14.905 --> 16:16.402
The driver? What about him?

16:16.522 --> 16:18.565
Well, did she ever talk to him?

16:19.357 --> 16:21.447
He was only friendly with the sporty types.

16:21.656 --> 16:24.685
Chloe was good at a lot of
things, but she was no athlete.

16:25.428 --> 16:26.629
You know, it's funny,

16:27.057 --> 16:28.509
she always we were a...

16:28.629 --> 16:30.099
bunch of hypocrites.

16:31.144 --> 16:32.364
Today proves it.

16:33.432 --> 16:35.950
That's some Oscar-winning
performances happening in there.

16:36.874 --> 16:39.076
Wh... was Chloe unpopular?

16:40.150 --> 16:42.240
She wasn't exactly Lausanne's biggest fan.

16:43.933 --> 16:46.548
You should've heard some of the
stuff she wrote about this place.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.500
She wrote?

16:56.412 --> 16:58.881
Oh, my dormatory looked just like this.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.107
I don't know where she kept her journal.

17:01.117 --> 17:03.892
Well, you are the expert on teenage girls.

17:04.843 --> 17:06.306
Um, I've got to go.

17:06.307 --> 17:09.074
Th-they're making me see some,
ah, bereavement counsellor.

17:09.457 --> 17:10.626
Thank you.

17:14.184 --> 17:15.656
Uh, don't we need a warrant?

17:15.666 --> 17:17.742
A student invited us in.

17:18.657 --> 17:19.876
Right.

17:33.457 --> 17:35.634
Well, she really didn't
want her journal found.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.005
Maybe she took it home.

17:37.414 --> 17:39.086
Where it might have
been read by her mother?

17:39.206 --> 17:40.919
I certainly wouldn't have risked that.

17:41.891 --> 17:44.705
I used to hide stuff
in my dorm all the time.

17:44.825 --> 17:47.623
Mostly vodka bottles from
my parents' drinking cabinet.

17:47.648 --> 17:49.598
I used to put them in hockey socks.

17:50.405 --> 17:52.240
It stops the clinking.

17:53.176 --> 17:55.795
Dormitory checks make a girl resourceful.

17:57.192 --> 17:58.359
Actually...

18:05.081 --> 18:06.281
Ugh!

18:10.560 --> 18:12.291
Not a drinker.

18:13.562 --> 18:16.037
_

18:16.194 --> 18:19.383
_

18:27.888 --> 18:29.431
Theo Arn.

18:29.632 --> 18:31.218
This must be the place.

18:37.775 --> 18:39.093
Ladies first.

18:47.546 --> 18:49.794
So this is what a driver salary gets you?

18:50.068 --> 18:51.702
I like what he did with the place.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.388
He'd cleared it out.

18:53.950 --> 18:56.915
Expecting his share of
fifteen million Euros.

18:57.492 --> 18:59.600
Well, maybe he was just tidy.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.016
Bit creepy.

19:01.636 --> 19:03.034
What are you trying to say?

19:03.094 --> 19:04.291
I'm tidy.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.744
That you're a bit creepy.

19:05.864 --> 19:08.751
Wow. Thanks for the clarification.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.252
Jeez.

19:13.690 --> 19:16.139
This guy was meticulous
and left nothing behind.

19:16.728 --> 19:18.241
A shredder.

19:18.466 --> 19:20.805
I wonder what secrets that thing munched.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.905
I wonder what day the trash was taken out.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.240
Aw! Fish pie?

19:34.654 --> 19:36.446
About a week old.

19:36.513 --> 19:38.020
I'm impressed.

19:43.726 --> 19:44.868
Are you...

19:45.196 --> 19:48.526
No. I was just having my
suit dry cleaned, so...

19:52.960 --> 19:55.761
I cannot believe that you just did that.

19:59.037 --> 20:00.714
I think I have something.

20:00.902 --> 20:01.947
What is it?

20:05.741 --> 20:07.856
Pays to get your hands dirty.

20:08.296 --> 20:10.496
Well, I hope Sebastian likes...

20:10.987 --> 20:12.648
what is that? Seafood?

20:12.799 --> 20:15.182
_

20:15.183 --> 20:17.475
_

20:17.476 --> 20:20.028
I don't know what time
I'll be finished here.

20:20.198 --> 20:21.280
Listen,

20:21.340 --> 20:22.889
could you just stay there with him?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.579
I'll be back as soon...

20:24.888 --> 20:26.954
One second, I'll call you back.

20:31.444 --> 20:33.674
- Inspector Costante?
- Sebastian,

20:33.680 --> 20:35.843
I'd like you to do a
little snooping for me.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.884
I need to get into the school's database.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.308
It'll take a little while.
Do we have permission?

20:43.789 --> 20:45.539
Carine won't like it.

20:45.849 --> 20:47.696
Whatever I find can't be used as evidence.

20:47.715 --> 20:50.042
OK, let's just see what
it's gonna throw up.

20:50.455 --> 20:52.867
- And, um, Sebastian?
- Yeah.

20:52.987 --> 20:54.933
Don't get caught, OK?

21:30.083 --> 21:32.405
"Mom says I'll get used to it here.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.501
"Sure, it... looks pretty
nice from the outside.

21:35.744 --> 21:37.501
"The lake, the chapel.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.518
"But we're locked in every night.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.211
"I miss my friends.

21:51.424 --> 21:53.358
"I miss New York.

22:01.997 --> 22:04.063
"Some people embrace the bubble.

22:04.804 --> 22:07.479
"It's so warm and safe in here.

22:08.850 --> 22:11.833
"The big fish grow very big.

22:13.669 --> 22:16.477
"Some live at the edges.

22:16.778 --> 22:19.808
"Telling themselves their
happiness is yet to come.

22:20.693 --> 22:23.998
"Others chase any form of escape.

22:30.838 --> 22:34.065
"I know I should feel beyond lucky.

22:35.579 --> 22:38.242
"But sometimes I feel
like I can't breathe."

22:41.219 --> 22:42.538
Uh...

22:42.590 --> 22:44.151
- You found it?
- Yeah, and this.

22:44.184 --> 22:45.719
Looks like a cocaine.

22:45.839 --> 22:48.315
- What does it say?
- Oh, she was in love.

22:48.361 --> 22:51.037
Doesn't say with whom, but
it didn't end well. She's...

22:51.221 --> 22:53.798
torn out most of the pages. Listen to this:

22:54.468 --> 22:56.226
"I'm going to make him pay.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.144
"I'm going to ruin his life
like he's ruined mine."

22:59.810 --> 23:01.680
I'm assuming you have a warrant.

23:02.434 --> 23:04.529
We found Chloe's journal.

23:05.253 --> 23:08.737
She... she wrote about,
uh, about her ex-boyfriend.

23:08.744 --> 23:10.427
Do you have any idea
who she's talking about?

23:10.484 --> 23:11.810
She didn't have any boyfriends here.

23:11.811 --> 23:13.440
She was too focused on her studies.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.660
Oh, I'm afraid she did have a boyfriend.

23:15.925 --> 23:18.171
And I think he's the
one who got her killed.

23:21.823 --> 23:24.076
_

23:24.126 --> 23:26.901
_

23:30.447 --> 23:32.267
Hey. What's up?

23:32.387 --> 23:34.462
Christmas has come early
this year, Sebastian.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.786
Wow.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.559
What is this?

23:37.566 --> 23:39.638
It's the only lead we
have on the other gunman.

23:39.657 --> 23:41.674
We found it in Arn's trash.

23:41.794 --> 23:42.951
Thanks.

23:44.910 --> 23:46.581
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

23:46.840 --> 23:47.988
Might be.

23:49.258 --> 23:51.652
I'll bet good money she found it.

23:51.973 --> 23:55.211
There's no way you'd get that
shiny suit of yours dirty.

23:55.619 --> 23:57.241
It's wooden silk.

23:58.614 --> 24:00.300
I'm right though, aren't I?

24:01.352 --> 24:03.183
I would have shown you this in my lab,

24:03.201 --> 24:05.841
but it smells strangely of seafood.

24:06.512 --> 24:09.315
It's a plane ticket Arn
purchased under a false name.

24:09.352 --> 24:11.521
Turns out he flew to
Prague three weeks ago.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.406
I'm guessing he wasn't sight-seeing.

24:13.412 --> 24:16.470
I figured, where's the best
place to meet criminals?

24:16.481 --> 24:17.702
Prison, right?

24:17.744 --> 24:22.216
So, I checked Arn's records to see
if he did any time with Czech inmates.

24:25.019 --> 24:27.774
David and Aleksandr Brosnek.

24:28.095 --> 24:30.603
Cocaine traffickers operating from Prague.

24:30.633 --> 24:32.276
Cocaine traffickers?

24:32.300 --> 24:34.137
Anything to do with narcoterrorism?

24:34.143 --> 24:35.678
Narcoterrorism, why?

24:35.726 --> 24:38.070
The victim was the US
ambassador's daughter,

24:38.106 --> 24:40.698
the FBI called Dorn, they
raised the possibility.

24:40.818 --> 24:42.946
No, there's no indication of that.

24:42.971 --> 24:46.059
These clowns seem way too
low-level for that sort of thing.

24:46.071 --> 24:48.947
Is there any evidence that they
were in touch with our driver,

24:48.983 --> 24:51.020
- before the hijacking?
- No.

24:51.026 --> 24:53.147
But if Arn was recruiting
for this stand office,

24:53.159 --> 24:54.561
they'd certainly provide muscle.

24:54.567 --> 24:57.256
Is it worth a trip to Prague
to try and find these guys?

24:57.274 --> 24:58.422
Yeah.

24:58.476 --> 25:00.954
It's a great lead. Well done, Sebastian.

25:00.972 --> 25:02.404
Thank you.

25:04.023 --> 25:06.192
Madam Ambassador, Michel Dorn.

25:06.990 --> 25:10.234
We have identified two suspects

25:10.476 --> 25:12.374
as possible accomplices.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.921
That's good news.

25:14.713 --> 25:17.057
Your detective was here. I found him

25:17.069 --> 25:19.438
going through some of Chloe's possessions.

25:19.451 --> 25:22.907
He's creating an in-depth profile of her.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.602
Th-that's his field of expertise.

25:26.036 --> 25:27.094
I...

25:27.214 --> 25:29.402
don't recognize this girl

25:29.583 --> 25:31.087
that he's investigating.

25:31.436 --> 25:32.646
She wasn't happy.

25:34.888 --> 25:36.701
She didn't tell me. I mean...

25:38.006 --> 25:39.782
Did she feel that she couldn't?

25:39.902 --> 25:42.453
Teenagers keep secrets.

25:43.366 --> 25:45.366
Especially from their mother.

25:46.992 --> 25:49.155
I should have spent more time with her.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.615
It was a mistake

25:51.651 --> 25:53.228
to send her away to school.

25:53.445 --> 25:55.331
May I ask why you did?

25:55.693 --> 25:57.210
I thought it would be good for her.

25:57.681 --> 26:01.573
Well then, you did what
you thought was right.

26:02.025 --> 26:04.756
Just as you're doing now, Madam Ambassador.

26:05.493 --> 26:07.934
Pursuing justice in the midst of

26:08.580 --> 26:10.278
what must be

26:11.365 --> 26:12.870
crippling grief.

26:13.807 --> 26:15.426
It takes courage.

26:16.055 --> 26:17.572
True courage.

26:17.831 --> 26:20.351
I want to hear her voice again.

26:20.381 --> 26:21.475
You know?

26:32.937 --> 26:35.185
Aristotle once distinguished

26:35.220 --> 26:37.244
four characteristics

26:37.280 --> 26:39.250
of the tragic hero.

26:39.370 --> 26:42.211
Played by Robert Pattinson.

26:42.235 --> 26:45.340
Surprisingly, cheekbones and
dreamy hair aren't up there

26:45.365 --> 26:46.566
but if they were,

26:46.572 --> 26:49.200
Mr. DeSabato, you'd be a front runner.

26:51.061 --> 26:52.777
Please continue, Mr. Lorcan.

26:54.028 --> 26:56.584
The first, nobility.

26:56.650 --> 26:59.290
The second is known as hamatia,

26:59.333 --> 27:03.139
a single flaw that sends
the hero to his doom.

27:03.654 --> 27:06.222
Followed by a reversal of fortune,

27:06.234 --> 27:09.515
and finally, the realisation that the hero

27:09.552 --> 27:12.374
has brought this upon himself.

27:14.006 --> 27:16.653
Your essays are due next Tuesday.

27:21.564 --> 27:24.694
Mr. Lorcan, we would
like to speak to Matteo.

27:26.649 --> 27:29.199
_

27:29.205 --> 27:31.664
_

27:45.111 --> 27:47.008
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.672
We're looking for some
information on two men

27:49.673 --> 27:51.764
who stayed here about three weeks ago.

27:51.788 --> 27:54.652
- David and Aleksandr Brosnek.
- Brosnek.

27:54.676 --> 27:57.909
Yeah, we need possible details, addresses.

27:57.933 --> 28:01.378
- Any information they provided.
- Oh, you can ask them yourselves.

28:01.421 --> 28:03.324
They checked in again this morning.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.001
Mr. Brosnek?

28:14.814 --> 28:16.070
(Speaks Czech)

28:24.866 --> 28:26.660
Excuse the interruption.

28:38.712 --> 28:42.392
Inspector Seeger, and
Wilkinson, from the ICC.

28:42.416 --> 28:43.422
Where's your brother?

28:43.445 --> 28:45.529
He checked in with you.
When's he coming back?

28:45.587 --> 28:47.230
We have reason to believe you were involved

28:47.249 --> 28:49.067
in the hijacking of a school bus.

28:49.105 --> 28:51.218
And the murder of Chloe Hanbury.

28:51.716 --> 28:55.654
Nice forged passports, Mr. Beren.

28:57.477 --> 28:59.884
When did you last see Theo Arn?

28:59.990 --> 29:01.190
Blah!

29:01.536 --> 29:03.991
I hope your brother is
as charming as you are.

29:04.019 --> 29:06.143
What's he saved under...

29:06.464 --> 29:10.155
I'm guessing "D" is for David, uh?

29:12.525 --> 29:14.064
Are they our guys?

29:14.184 --> 29:16.335
Could be. Aleksandr has been travelling

29:16.343 --> 29:18.828
on a fake passport, I wouldn't
be surprised if he took a

29:18.858 --> 29:20.867
recent trip to Geneva.

29:20.987 --> 29:22.824
I've sent the details to your phone.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.946
How's the trace coming?

29:24.953 --> 29:27.537
They're within a half kilometre of you.

29:30.844 --> 29:35.512
So, Brosnek's close. Sebastian is getting
an exact location on him. What's that?

29:35.632 --> 29:37.884
Falafel wrap, supposedly.

29:38.315 --> 29:41.439
- I'll pass, thanks. Aren't you vegan?
- Yeah.

29:41.783 --> 29:43.149
That's meat.

29:43.476 --> 29:46.146
About 80% rat, I'm guessing.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.936
Come in, Matteo.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.852
Have I done something wrong?

30:04.051 --> 30:06.087
- Does he have to be here?
- Oh yeah.

30:06.347 --> 30:07.392
Please.

30:07.803 --> 30:09.356
You can speak freely, Matteo.

30:09.368 --> 30:11.845
It's important you tell
the police the truth.

30:12.033 --> 30:14.093
Were you friendly with Chloe?

30:14.148 --> 30:16.009
- Sure.
- How friendly?

30:18.594 --> 30:20.147
I have a girlfriend.

30:20.413 --> 30:21.942
Come on, you're 17.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.619
I remember 17.

30:28.545 --> 30:29.627
Well...

30:29.675 --> 30:31.863
OK then, can you tell how Chloe

30:31.881 --> 30:34.806
got a hold of the cocaine
we found in her room?

30:34.981 --> 30:36.111
I'm sorry?

30:36.642 --> 30:38.552
Chloe was in possession of cocaine.

30:38.672 --> 30:41.929
That's a serious allegation
to make against a student.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.498
We have a rigorous anti-drugs policy.

30:44.516 --> 30:46.141
One strike, and you're out.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.455
'Cause that's working, isn't it?

30:48.456 --> 30:50.619
Half the school's on something, man.

30:51.048 --> 30:52.306
Who's dealing?

30:52.772 --> 30:54.355
I don't do that shit.

30:55.582 --> 30:58.325
Look, OK, Chloe and I hooked up once.

31:01.201 --> 31:02.343
What?

31:02.463 --> 31:04.676
Kids have sex, that's a reality!

31:04.687 --> 31:06.784
I mean, you can try and
pretend all you like.

31:06.808 --> 31:08.391
You know what? My dad

31:08.427 --> 31:10.294
is gonna be really pissed off

31:10.318 --> 31:11.907
to find out you've been sitting here

31:11.925 --> 31:14.088
asking me all these
questions without a lawyer.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.892
And you've been letting it happen.

31:18.016 --> 31:19.611
So can I go now?

31:25.858 --> 31:27.302
Inspector Costante,

31:27.326 --> 31:29.840
I don't see how interrogating my students

31:29.852 --> 31:31.955
gets you any closer to
finding those gunman.

31:31.961 --> 31:35.104
Well, we believe someone on this
campus was involved in Chloe's murder.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.237
That's profoundly unlikely.

31:37.249 --> 31:39.774
This school was funded upon its reputation.
If word get out

31:39.775 --> 31:42.294
- to the parents about this...
- We'll be discreet.

31:42.578 --> 31:45.001
Well, you better make bloody
sure that you're right.

31:45.176 --> 31:48.179
Because making allegations
like that is not only reckless,

31:48.299 --> 31:50.294
it could also be considered slander.

32:03.659 --> 32:05.750
So, what are your thoughts?

32:05.762 --> 32:07.623
Well, Matteo is lying to us.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.774
He thinks his daddy's
lawyers can protect him.

32:12.106 --> 32:13.442
Aurelia?

32:13.562 --> 32:15.152
- Sorry.
- Hey.

32:15.272 --> 32:16.512
How are you holding up?

32:17.745 --> 32:19.461
The grieving process.

32:19.581 --> 32:20.838
Oh, um...

32:21.092 --> 32:23.872
- I mean, yeah it's awful.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

32:23.992 --> 32:26.403
Can I... show you something?

32:31.854 --> 32:35.045
"Aurelia called me a
slut in French yesterday.

32:35.093 --> 32:37.347
"Pretty ironic when she has had

32:37.395 --> 32:38.934
most of the basketball team."

32:38.935 --> 32:41.552
I mean, your name crops up a lot in here.

32:42.283 --> 32:45.087
OK, so, we weren't that close. But...

32:45.274 --> 32:47.854
- I'm still upset.
- Yeah, I bet you are.

32:47.974 --> 32:51.129
Especially after what happened
between her and Matteo.

32:53.612 --> 32:56.198
I take it you knew that
the two of them, uh...

32:56.252 --> 32:58.694
What's the expression, Ellie? Hooked up.

33:01.805 --> 33:04.234
I need you to tell us
whatever you're hiding.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.703
Sebastian located Brosnek.
He says we're close.

33:12.035 --> 33:13.455
Very close.

33:21.231 --> 33:22.410
That's him.

33:22.591 --> 33:24.156
Sure looks like it.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.217
Right!

33:32.212 --> 33:35.106
- Right, oy!
- Hey!

33:35.620 --> 33:37.269
Stop, police!

33:39.312 --> 33:40.847
Shit!

33:41.179 --> 33:42.533
Fuck.

33:48.447 --> 33:49.795
Hey!

34:01.113 --> 34:02.285
Hey!

34:03.186 --> 34:05.609
Police! Everyone get down!

34:08.504 --> 34:11.072
Police! Everyone get down!

34:12.000 --> 34:14.038
Let's go! Hey!

34:42.254 --> 34:43.324
Hey!

34:43.654 --> 34:44.952
Yeowch!

34:44.953 --> 34:46.188
Shit.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.226
Right?

34:54.347 --> 34:56.716
OK, OK.

34:59.050 --> 35:00.222
Where is he?

35:02.612 --> 35:04.467
Stop! Halt!

35:04.587 --> 35:06.486
Arabela, move!

35:07.123 --> 35:08.579
Move!

35:10.257 --> 35:11.701
No!

35:13.242 --> 35:14.306
Fuck!

35:18.843 --> 35:20.034
Jesus.

35:20.668 --> 35:22.016
Nice one.

35:29.163 --> 35:32.565
This is so fucked up. After
all I've done to help him.

35:33.635 --> 35:35.973
- Bastard.
- Helped him how?

35:36.414 --> 35:37.750
Covered for him?

35:39.025 --> 35:41.097
Was he dealing drugs, Aurelia?

35:45.792 --> 35:48.070
Arn drove it in, Matt sold it.

35:49.726 --> 35:52.161
Matteo and Arn were working together.

35:58.664 --> 35:59.914
Inspector Costante.

35:59.926 --> 36:02.265
Did you get that info
from the school's database?

36:02.385 --> 36:05.262
I just sent it through, along
with Chloe's autopsy report.

36:05.987 --> 36:08.138
There is something about
her I think you should know.

36:08.403 --> 36:09.376
OK.

36:12.947 --> 36:15.563
Three hours before that coach was hijacked,

36:15.582 --> 36:18.434
your fake passports were
used to fly to Geneva.

36:18.554 --> 36:21.467
That's where the car found
in the tunnel was stolen from.

36:21.806 --> 36:23.728
It's quite a coincidence, no?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.298
Look,

36:25.606 --> 36:27.159
the sooner you come clean,

36:27.177 --> 36:28.966
the better it is for you and your brother.

36:29.539 --> 36:31.315
You'll be going back to prison.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.430
Question is:

36:33.485 --> 36:35.304
how long do you wanna spend there?

36:35.424 --> 36:38.439
- This is one of our gunmen?
- Almost certainly.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.827
But the evidence against
him and his brother

36:40.851 --> 36:42.778
is purely circumstantial, and

36:42.953 --> 36:45.624
- they know it.
- You confirmed that they're just

36:45.744 --> 36:48.667
traffickers, no connection
at all to the terrorism?

36:51.004 --> 36:52.019
What?

36:54.581 --> 36:55.850
That's it.

36:56.098 --> 36:57.312
Thank you.

36:59.535 --> 37:00.749
Theo Arn,

37:00.774 --> 37:04.562
he contacts you. He says that
he has idea to make some cash.

37:04.682 --> 37:06.846
Some rich kids' parents will give it up,

37:06.858 --> 37:09.160
seems like a pretty straightforward plan.

37:09.335 --> 37:10.955
Here's what I...

37:12.985 --> 37:14.508
You're in the tunnel,

37:15.034 --> 37:16.714
you hear the shots,

37:17.330 --> 37:19.856
they're coming from
the bus, it's two shots.

37:20.539 --> 37:21.995
Are you surprised?

37:22.399 --> 37:24.297
Did you know that he was gonna kill

37:24.417 --> 37:26.877
Chloe, that he was gonna kill that girl?

37:28.164 --> 37:29.880
See, I don't think that you did.

37:30.176 --> 37:31.735
Because you fled.

37:32.012 --> 37:33.698
Without the money.

37:39.663 --> 37:42.400
Because you are suspects,

37:42.429 --> 37:45.892
in the murder of a US
ambassador's daughter,

37:46.266 --> 37:48.852
the FBI wants to extradite you.

37:49.710 --> 37:52.145
They will take you to a facility,

37:52.174 --> 37:55.208
and you will be tried as terrorists.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.821
Do you have

37:56.941 --> 37:59.413
any idea what they'll do to you in there?

38:01.020 --> 38:03.455
I don't think that you're terrorists.

38:03.575 --> 38:06.772
I think that this was a punt for cash,

38:06.808 --> 38:08.482
that went wrong.

38:10.706 --> 38:12.041
I gotta say,

38:12.071 --> 38:15.280
I don't think that the FBI
is going to believe that.

38:15.787 --> 38:18.554
- We are not terrorists.
- Right.

38:19.189 --> 38:22.047
This was a plan by Theo Arn.

38:22.313 --> 38:23.588
He needed you there.

38:23.848 --> 38:26.144
Just in case he needed backup.

38:26.861 --> 38:30.571
This is the gun that
killed Chloe and Theo Arn.

38:31.053 --> 38:33.923
Did you give this gun, to Arn?

38:35.830 --> 38:37.671
Not this one.

38:39.371 --> 38:42.033
I've never seen this gun before.

38:42.723 --> 38:44.337
We gave him

38:44.457 --> 38:46.575
a P09.

38:50.465 --> 38:51.919
OK.

38:52.183 --> 38:55.081
We got the brothers to
confess to being in the tunnel

38:55.096 --> 38:58.223
but they said that they give
Arn a different gun, a P09.

38:58.231 --> 39:01.267
Same kind of gun that David was
packing when we picked him up.

39:01.313 --> 39:03.655
Why lie? They have no reason to.

39:03.793 --> 39:05.303
Unless they weren't lying.

39:19.971 --> 39:22.229
- Where's Matteo?
- On his way.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.077
Come on in. Take a seat.

39:31.193 --> 39:33.119
Well, how do you think he was involved?

39:34.766 --> 39:36.329
We hope to find out.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.921
Must be a very smart boy.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.771
- Well, he's a good student.
- Oh.

39:40.891 --> 39:42.470
He almost had us fooled.

39:42.659 --> 39:44.774
Just like you were saying in class,

39:44.894 --> 39:46.610
all it takes is one mistake.

39:46.799 --> 39:49.624
- Hamartia.
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:49.744 --> 39:53.008
The gun used to shoot Arn and Chloe

39:53.016 --> 39:55.342
was a SIG Sauer, but,

39:55.652 --> 39:58.756
Arn's accomplices have confirmed that

39:58.771 --> 40:03.174
they gave Arn a Czech pistol,
so where is Arn original gun?

40:04.292 --> 40:06.611
- I don't understand.
- I didn't either.

40:06.626 --> 40:10.486
Not... not for a long time. But
then, I was under the, ah,

40:10.493 --> 40:13.749
false assumption that Arn shot Chloe.

40:16.559 --> 40:18.940
There are plenty of ways to abort a foetus.

40:23.818 --> 40:25.593
Chloe was pregnant.

40:25.895 --> 40:27.436
With your baby.

40:28.539 --> 40:32.331
But that wouldn't be good for the school's
precious reputation, now, would it?

40:32.451 --> 40:35.132
To have its headmaster
jailed as a sex offender.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.108
And then you discovered,

40:40.154 --> 40:42.397
someone had been hacking school files

40:42.420 --> 40:45.577
on parents who donated
large amounts of money.

40:46.454 --> 40:48.682
Listing the most wealthy students.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.394
It must have been alarming,
when you discovered

40:51.514 --> 40:53.645
that your coach driver was doing this.

40:54.347 --> 40:56.356
I confronted Arn,

40:56.372 --> 40:59.144
he confessed his plan, I
was gonna go to the police.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.719
Instead you used it at your own advantage.

41:02.203 --> 41:06.266
It was you who told Arn to use
Chloe as... as prime hostage.

41:06.304 --> 41:09.990
And that's why Arn said Chloe's name.

41:10.993 --> 41:13.364
She was 17 years old.

41:17.928 --> 41:19.877
We loved each other.

41:21.652 --> 41:23.049
She loved me.

41:23.169 --> 41:25.201
"You ruined my life", she wrote.

41:25.639 --> 41:28.102
It wasn't the drugs, it was the baby.

41:28.222 --> 41:30.617
And that's why she was in the toilet.

41:30.934 --> 41:32.966
Morning sickness.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.137
Arn's gun.

41:52.884 --> 41:54.501
The P09.

42:01.329 --> 42:03.202
The coward's way out.

42:25.664 --> 42:30.226
Nicholas Lorcan, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Chloe Hanbury.

42:37.175 --> 42:40.158
- Are you OK?
- How did you know the gun was empty?

42:40.717 --> 42:43.723
The Brosnek's testimony suggested
there was another weapon.

42:43.843 --> 42:47.024
I searched the coach, and found it
hidden in the panel, under Lorcan's seat.

42:47.144 --> 42:48.823
I removed the bullets.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.648
That's when I knew it was him.

42:52.395 --> 42:55.162
The word of two coke traffickers
wouldn't have got us a conviction,

42:55.180 --> 42:58.456
and Sebastian wasn't strictly
allowed to hack the school's database.

42:58.461 --> 43:00.969
- We had to catch him red-handed.
- So why didn't you tell me?

43:00.976 --> 43:01.924
I didn't know for sure

43:01.925 --> 43:04.154
- until I found the gun...
- No, you didn't trust me!

43:04.467 --> 43:07.778
And I get it, I wouldn't trust
me either. But you had no right.

43:08.323 --> 43:10.518
Look, I know I wear my heart on my sleeve,

43:10.532 --> 43:12.501
and I need to be more
like you. But I can't,

43:13.950 --> 43:15.603
when I think about how

43:15.802 --> 43:19.011
alone and scared Chloe would
have been, how hopeless she was.

43:21.389 --> 43:23.405
I guess you think I'm pathetic now.

43:27.685 --> 43:28.792
Listen to me, Ellie,

43:28.831 --> 43:30.300
your compassion,

43:31.871 --> 43:33.118
is a strength,

43:33.616 --> 43:34.781
not a weakness.

43:35.492 --> 43:37.531
I know it sometimes feels like a burden.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.188
But you need to learn to value it.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.475
One day it's gonna make
you a great detective.

43:48.726 --> 43:50.720
They don't teach you this shit at school?

44:11.595 --> 44:13.341
Madam Ambassador.

44:14.072 --> 44:16.531
Will you be returning to Geneva?

44:17.129 --> 44:18.258
New York.

44:19.032 --> 44:21.576
I'm... taking Chloe home.

44:25.003 --> 44:26.997
Your inspector was right.

44:28.182 --> 44:29.249
There was...

44:29.369 --> 44:30.989
part of her I never knew.

44:32.324 --> 44:34.627
And I was too angry to see it.

44:35.599 --> 44:37.768
Injustice breeds anger.

44:38.602 --> 44:41.937
And there is no greater
injustice in this life

44:42.368 --> 44:44.435
than the loss of a child.

44:46.465 --> 44:48.308
Inspector Costante

44:48.879 --> 44:50.595
gave me this,

44:51.248 --> 44:53.581
and asked me to give it to you.

44:57.180 --> 45:00.776
he said your daughter's
voice is on every page.
