WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.336
Higher.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.397
Lieutenant, we're already
at 200,000 meters.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.136
You could thermalize
at this altitude.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.769
l said higher.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.944
We're at 300,000 meters.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.488
Level us off.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.750
Computer, disengage
safety protocols.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.223
Warning.

00:26.292 --> 00:30.524
Disengaging safety protocols
presents extreme risk of injury.

00:30.597 --> 00:31.962
Override.

00:32.064 --> 00:32.963
Acknowledged.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.796
Safety protocols
have been disengaged.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.432
Drop the force field on my mark.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.769
Aye.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.041
Mark.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.584
Bridge to Torres.

00:57.657 --> 00:58.954
l don't believe it.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.391
Report to Engineering
on the double.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.720
Computer, end program.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.018 --> 01:27.111
l was not aware
that protective attire

01:27.187 --> 01:28.848
was required for this mission.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.221
l was on the holodeck--
orbital skydiving.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.817
Leaping from a spacecraft
at exospheric altitudes.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.259
A curious form of recreation.

01:36.329 --> 01:37.796
The probe is ready for launch.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.559
However, there is
still a problem

01:39.632 --> 01:40.894
with the telemetry link.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.161
Lieutenant?

01:42.268 --> 01:43.496
ls something wrong?

01:43.603 --> 01:46.003
Actually, l'm not
feeling so well.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.835
Can you handle the launch
without me?

01:48.908 --> 01:51.103
You are putting me in charge?

01:51.177 --> 01:52.439
Problem?

01:52.512 --> 01:54.537
No. Just unexpected.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.673
Shall l inform the Doctor
you are ill?

01:56.749 --> 01:57.841
No.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.384
Don't.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.474
Captain, someone's
locked on to our probe

04:03.543 --> 04:04.805
with a tractor beam.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.868
lt looks like a Malon freighter.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.447
l had a feeling we hadn't
seen the last of them.

04:09.515 --> 04:10.675
Open a channel.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.842
Aye, Captain.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.284
Starship Voyager
to the Malon vessel.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.981
That probe belongs to us.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.522
Release it immediately.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.022
No response.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.619
Tom, how fast can
you get us there?

04:23.696 --> 04:24.993
Two hours at least.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.691
They'll be long gone.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.633
lf we instruct the probe
to emit a polaron burst,

04:29.736 --> 04:31.727
it could disrupt
the tractor beam.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.964
Do it.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.373
The beam has been disabled.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.106
Harry, redirect
the probe's course.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.910
The Malon are in pursuit.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.917
That probe can't outrun them.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.577
No.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.849
But we might be able
to hide it from them.

04:49.922 --> 04:50.946
Captain?

04:51.057 --> 04:54.322
The probe surveyed a class-6
gas giant this morning.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.363
l think we should send it
back for a closer look.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.196
You're going to steer the probe
into a gas giant.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.563
Captain...

05:02.669 --> 05:04.569
the atmospheric pressure
will crush it.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.128
Not if the Borg shielding
does its job.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.611
Hail them again.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.548
No response.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.246
Voyager to Malon vessel.
Break off your pursuit.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.687
The probe is entering
the giant's upper atmosphere

05:23.756 --> 05:26.418
and the Malon vessel
is following it in.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.770
The probe's stuck
in a deep layer

05:38.838 --> 05:41.636
of liquid hydrogen and methane
about 10,000 kilometers below

05:41.708 --> 05:43.175
the outer atmosphere.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.642
lt's not responding to commands.

05:45.712 --> 05:46.804
Any good news?

05:46.879 --> 05:47.937
lt's still intact.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.174
lt can be repaired.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.079
lf we can get it out of there.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.583
Sorry l'm late.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.048
We were just discussing
how to retrieve the probe.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.648
ls there any possibility
of transporting it out?

05:59.726 --> 06:01.421
No.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.017
Just...

06:03.062 --> 06:04.256
no.

06:04.330 --> 06:08.096
l don't see how we could
get close enough.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.169
ls there any way
to boost transporter range?

06:10.236 --> 06:12.466
Not in that kind of atmosphere.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.234
Well, if we can't
transport it out,

06:15.308 --> 06:18.300
we'll just have
to fly in and grab it.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.879
Perhaps you weren't
paying attention

06:20.947 --> 06:23.279
when the Malon freighter
imploded.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.716
We won't be going
in a Malon freighter, Tuvok.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.619
We'll be going
in our new shuttlecraft.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.589
Oh, here we go again.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.885
Let's face it-- class-2 shuttles

06:33.025 --> 06:34.890
just don't cut it
in the Delta Quadrant.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.259
We've needed something bigger
and better since we got here.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.821
lt's time we built it.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.891
Tom, we've been through this
l don't know how many times.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.833
We all appreciate
your enthusiasm...

06:44.937 --> 06:45.995
Speak for yourself, Commander.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.902
Bottom line--
we don't have time

06:47.974 --> 06:50.568
to design and build
a ship from scratch.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.168
l knew you were going
to say that.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.510
So l've given us a head start.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.786
Behold the Delta Flyer.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.983
Ultra-aerodynamic contours,
retractable nacelles,

07:05.057 --> 07:07.491
parametallic hull plating,

07:07.560 --> 07:11.291
unimatrix shielding based on
Tuvok's brilliant design

07:11.364 --> 07:13.696
for the multispatial probe

07:13.766 --> 07:15.791
and a Borg-inspired
weapon system.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.671
The basic design elements are...

07:19.739 --> 07:21.297
adequate.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.739
High praise.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.644
lf we used isomagnetic EPS
conduits in the plasma manifold,

07:27.713 --> 07:30.409
we could maximize
the power distribution.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.212
That's the spirit, Harry.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.810
My shield designs could be
successfully applied

07:34.887 --> 07:36.252
to a vessel of this size.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.687
Big of you to admit it, Tuvok.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.054
And you think

07:39.125 --> 07:41.753
it'll be able to withstand
the gas giant's atmosphere.

07:41.828 --> 07:42.886
The probe did.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.157
l'm impressed.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.199
But how quickly can it be built?

07:47.266 --> 07:50.861
We could replicate the alloys
and the new design components,

07:50.970 --> 07:52.369
use spare parts from storage.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.497
lf we worked around the clock,

07:54.607 --> 07:56.370
we could have it up
and running inside a week.

07:56.442 --> 07:59.206
l'm willing to put in
as much overtime as it takes.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.679
l will forgo regeneration
for the duration of the project.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.909
What about you, B'Elanna?

08:04.984 --> 08:06.679
Building a new vessel
from scratch--

08:06.752 --> 08:08.811
that's an engineer's dream
come true.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.849
What do you say, Captain?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.821
Why are you all standing around?

08:31.511 --> 08:35.607
Computer, add dynametric
tail fins to the nacelles.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.388
Computer, delete
dynametric tail fins.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.420
What'd you do that for?

08:47.493 --> 08:49.893
We are not designing
a ''hot rod,'' Lieutenant.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.454
That is exactly
what we're designing--

08:53.533 --> 08:58.027
a 24th century, warp-powered,
ultra-responsive hot rod.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.264
Your embellishments
are purely decorative.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.068
They serve no practical purpose.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.267
No, l beg to differ.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.572
lf we make this thing
look mean enough,

09:05.645 --> 09:08.011
other ships are going to think
twice before taking us on.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.741
l suggest we return
our attention

09:09.815 --> 09:11.976
to the matter
of structural integrity.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.450
Agreed.

09:13.519 --> 09:16.716
Lieutenant Torres' hull design
is flawed.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.416
We should be using
tetraburnium alloys

09:18.491 --> 09:20.652
instead of titanium.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.219
Uh, B'Elanna?

09:24.297 --> 09:27.130
Sounds fine to me.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.300
l'm going to finish up
the thruster specs.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.023
lt's open.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.555
Hey.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.790
Thruster specs.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.853
Thanks.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.627
Where you running off to?

10:01.701 --> 10:03.191
My quarters.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.327
Stay a while.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.738
l'll, uh, replicate some dinner,
a bottle of burgundy.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.937
We deserve a break,
don't you think?

10:13.012 --> 10:15.071
Not tonight.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.047
B'Elanna...

10:17.116 --> 10:19.346
what's going on?

10:19.418 --> 10:21.249
Nothing.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.754
Well, then
how come it's impossible

10:23.823 --> 10:26.087
to have a conversation with you?

10:27.426 --> 10:28.688
l'm sorry.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.058
l don't want an apology.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.357
l want an explanation.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.127
Tom, l'm tired.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.964
Asleep is more like it.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.096
You hardly said three words
in that last meeting.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.608
And then when Seven
changed your design,

10:44.677 --> 10:46.144
you acted like...

10:46.212 --> 10:48.112
like you didn't care.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.273
l guess l didn't.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.443
l don't get it.

10:55.521 --> 10:59.924
How many times have we talked
about how great it would be

10:59.992 --> 11:01.983
to do what we're doing now?

11:02.094 --> 11:05.325
To really collaborate--
my piloting skills

11:05.364 --> 11:06.991
and your engineering expertise.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.534
We finally get the chance
to create something

11:09.635 --> 11:11.364
together from the ground up

11:11.470 --> 11:14.564
and you're not the slightest
bit enthusiastic?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.539
l'm doing my job, aren't l?

11:16.609 --> 11:19.703
l delivered the thruster
specs on schedule.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.145
B'Elanna, l'm not your boss.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.876
l'm not questioning
your productivity

11:24.950 --> 11:28.147
or keeping tabs
on how many hours you put in.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.848
l just want to know
what's going on.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.319
l have to go.

11:56.348 --> 12:01.115
Computer, activate holodeck
program Torres 2-1-6.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.212
The program is active.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.484
Disengage safety protocols.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.118
Warning.
Disengaging safety protocols

12:08.194 --> 12:10.492
presents extreme risk of injury.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.554
Override.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.757
Acknowledged.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.825
Safety protocols
have been disengaged.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.306
Ooh!

13:19.231 --> 13:20.789
Ensign, put us
into a high orbit.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.164
l want to stay well-above
that ionospheric turbulence.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.702
Aye, ma'am.

13:25.905 --> 13:26.894
There's the probe.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.939
10,000 kilometers

13:29.041 --> 13:31.839
beneath all that methane
but still intact.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.037
We're not alone.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.603
l'm reading massive
theta radiation.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.615
lt's being dumped
by a Malon freighter

13:37.683 --> 13:40.311
approaching from the far side
of the planet.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.512
They're hailing.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.452
Well, they're more talkative
than the last ones.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.454
Open a channel.

13:44.523 --> 13:45.455
Aye, sir.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.321
Leave orbit of this planet now.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.384
l don't believe
we've been introduced.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.621
l'm Captain Janeway.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.527
l know exactly who you are.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.156
You are the person responsible

13:54.233 --> 13:56.565
for the destruction
of one of our freighters

13:56.669 --> 13:59.399
and the deaths
of nine Malon citizens.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.302
l'm very sorry
that lives were lost,

14:01.407 --> 14:03.739
but you're leaving out
an important detail.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.438
Your people were trying
to steal a probe from us.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.037
We warned them to stay away
from the gas giant,

14:09.114 --> 14:10.604
but they didn't listen.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.119
l'm taking your probe
as compensation for our losses.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.120
That's going to be
a little difficult.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.815
lt's stuck
beneath the atmosphere

14:17.890 --> 14:20.450
of the same gas giant
that crushed your other ship.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.188
My people are expert
at salvage operations.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.890
Well, Mr....

14:25.965 --> 14:28.058
Vrelk. Controller Vrelk.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.101
Vrelk.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.899
We have a little expertise
of our own.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.939
We're a very determined crew.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.941
So my suggestion is
that you leave orbit

14:38.077 --> 14:39.908
and in the future,
if you come across anything

14:39.979 --> 14:42.777
that bears the insignia
of the USS Voyager,

14:42.848 --> 14:44.816
head in the other direction.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.613
You are making a serious error.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.414
End transmission.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.413
Why would people in the business
of toxic waste disposal

14:53.492 --> 14:55.790
be so anxious
to get hold of a probe?

14:55.861 --> 14:57.123
lt's not just any probe.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.788
lt's multispatial technology.

14:58.864 --> 15:01.355
Maybe they think it'll
help them find new places

15:01.433 --> 15:02.525
to dump their garbage.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.244
B'Elanna.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.806
What a nice surprise.

16:25.884 --> 16:28.352
l was just getting
ready to close.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.682
Business has been slow

16:29.755 --> 16:32.553
with so many people
busy on the new shuttle.

16:32.624 --> 16:35.354
Oh.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.794
l-l was just hoping
we could catch up.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.058
You want to catch up?

16:40.132 --> 16:41.156
W-with me?

16:41.233 --> 16:43.360
lf you have the time.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.766
Are you kidding?

16:44.870 --> 16:47.634
Yeah, we-- can l
get you something?

16:49.541 --> 16:51.839
Name your poison.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.844
Oh.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.371
Um...

16:56.448 --> 16:58.109
Come on, B'Elanna,
l handed that one to you

16:58.183 --> 16:59.172
on a silver platter.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.878
Huh?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.112
Name your poison?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.984
l was expecting one of those

17:04.056 --> 17:07.184
scathing but affectionate
insults you always make

17:07.259 --> 17:08.317
about my cooking.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.417
Sorry.

17:09.494 --> 17:12.055
You'll feel wittier
on a full stomach.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.655
So, uh, what'll it be?

17:13.732 --> 17:16.165
You know, actually...

17:16.268 --> 17:20.034
l was hoping
for banana pancakes.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.471
Huh. l-l-l don't think
l ever heard

17:22.540 --> 17:24.372
of banana pancakes before.

17:24.443 --> 17:28.106
My grandmother used to make them
for me when l was a kid.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.410
lt's always put a smile
on my face.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.882
Well, then...

17:32.985 --> 17:35.044
one smile coming right up.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.989
Computer,
one stack of banana pancakes.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.071
Smells delicious.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.971
Thanks.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.648
So how have you been?

18:07.719 --> 18:10.449
Oh, just great.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.184
My security training
is going really well.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.556
Tuvok told me the other day
that l'm, uh...

18:16.929 --> 18:19.159
Not completely inept.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.201
Aren't you going to try them?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.237
Oh, sure.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.107
Well?

18:42.221 --> 18:43.950
Delicious.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.792
l have to get back to work.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.406
What are they still doing here?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.941
Apparently, they're not willing

19:04.009 --> 19:05.567
to give up on the probe
so easily.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.202
The question is:
How do they expect

19:07.279 --> 19:08.541
to get their hands on it?

19:08.614 --> 19:09.808
lt's reasonable to assume

19:09.882 --> 19:12.043
they're waiting for us
to retrieve the probe,

19:12.117 --> 19:15.814
at which time, they'll
attempt to steal it again.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.049
Maybe, but they have to know
we're prepared for that.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.954
lf they were planning
to fight, you'd think

19:20.025 --> 19:22.084
they'd call in reinforcements,
try to outgun us.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.120
Sensors don't show any other
Malon ships in the area.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.495
Seven of Nine to the Captain.

19:27.566 --> 19:28.590
Janeway here.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.191
Report to the Astrometrics Lab.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.169
l have important information
regarding the Malon vessel.

19:34.573 --> 19:35.631
Tuvok?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.476
What have you got?

19:41.547 --> 19:43.879
l've been using
coherent neutrino beams

19:43.949 --> 19:46.645
to document activity aboard
the Malon freighter.

19:46.718 --> 19:49.186
ln other words,
you've been spying on them.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.688
l've made a troubling discovery.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.816
This is a polythermal image

19:53.892 --> 19:55.985
of an interior section
of the alien ship.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.359
The shaded figures you see
are Malon crew members.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.898
That appears to be
a small ship.

20:00.999 --> 20:04.230
Correct. The Malon
are constructing a spacecraft

20:04.336 --> 20:06.270
composed of tetraburnium alloys.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.068
Theoretically, such a ship
would be capable

20:09.141 --> 20:12.110
of withstanding extreme
atmospheric pressures.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.701
l'll be damned.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.940
They're going after
the probe themselves.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.276
That's not all, Captain.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.409
According to my projections,
they will finish construction

20:20.485 --> 20:23.511
of their vessel at least 36
hours before we finish ours.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.290
Well, then...

20:30.362 --> 20:31.454
l'd say we've got

20:31.530 --> 20:33.998
an old-fashioned space race
on our hands.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.435
Captain's Log, supplemental.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.976
We've stepped up the pace
of construction

20:46.078 --> 20:49.275
in order to finish our shuttle
before the Malon finish theirs.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.646
According to Seven's
most recent intelligence,

20:51.717 --> 20:54.117
we've gained some ground
over the last 24 hours,

20:54.186 --> 20:58.020
putting us in a virtual dead
heat with our competitors.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.455
l keep telling you

20:59.524 --> 21:01.458
we've got to reinforce
the hull with kellinite.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.891
That's all there is to it.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.692
Proposing the same flawed
strategy over and over again

21:05.764 --> 21:07.288
will not make it
more effective, Ensign.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.890
Well, we've got
to come up with something

21:09.067 --> 21:10.864
or we'll never get this thing
off the ground.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.639
Vorik, turn that damn thing off.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.541
l can't hear myself think.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.738
Sorry, sir.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.111
Look, we could spend

21:24.182 --> 21:27.743
weeks trying to solve this,
but we've got a ticking clock.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.811
Engines are working;
weapon systems are on line.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.449
l say we launch now
and hope for the best.

21:33.525 --> 21:37.154
Mr. Paris, that is perhaps
the most illogical statement

21:37.229 --> 21:38.321
you've ever made.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.232
Unless we find a way

21:42.334 --> 21:44.165
to reconfigure
the structural integrity field,

21:44.269 --> 21:47.238
the hull will incur
microfractures during descent.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.570
Microfractures, Tuvok.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.632
Doesn't necessarily mean
we'll have a hull breach.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.837
And if we do, l suppose
these useless design

21:54.913 --> 21:56.972
elements from your
''Captain Proton'' scenario

21:57.049 --> 21:58.539
will compensate for the problem.

21:58.617 --> 22:02.781
Hey, every one of these knobs
and levers is fully functional.

22:02.854 --> 22:03.878
And completely superfluous.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.149
Maybe to you.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.589
l am tired of tapping panels.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.456
For once, l want controls

22:09.528 --> 22:12.258
that let me actually feel
the ship l'm piloting.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.263
Where you going?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.526
Holodeck.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.590
What for?

22:16.702 --> 22:19.694
To find out
if this microfracture problem

22:19.805 --> 22:21.272
is a fatal flaw.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.344
Computer,
activate immersion shielding.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.349
lmmersion shielding activated.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.351
Commence descent sequence.

22:34.419 --> 22:37.445
Range to probe--
30,000 kilometers. 25,000.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.319
Warning.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.588
Atmospheric pressure
is exceeding tolerance levels.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.219
Rapid ascent recommended.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.354
Continue descent.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.955
Acknowledged. Range to probe--
10,000 kilometers.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.727
Disengage safety protocols.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.962
Warning.
Disengaging safety protocols

22:52.104 --> 22:54.004
presents extreme risk of injury.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.003
Override.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.232
Acknowledged.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.809
Safety protocols
have been disengaged.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.869
Warning. Atmospheric pressure
is exceeding tolerance levels.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.415
Reroute power
from secondary systems

23:05.484 --> 23:07.145
to structural integrity.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.208
Acknowledged.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.483
Microfractures are present
in zones one and four.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.563
The Malon are venting
a theta radiation cloud.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.659
Our shields are
down to 89 percent.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.499
Ensign, back us off.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.072
Vrelk is hailing.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.304
On screen.

23:33.211 --> 23:35.145
That was rude, wasn't it?

23:35.213 --> 23:39.809
But we still have quite a bit
of antimatter waste to expel.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.718
l hope we didn't
damage your shields.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.153
Our shields are fine.

23:44.222 --> 23:48.625
Mmm. Well, we only ejected a
small amount of waste this time.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.890
We still have much, much more
to get rid of.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.625
Your shields
may not be able to stand

23:54.699 --> 23:56.963
even higher levels
of theta radiation.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.559
l've already told you
we're not going anywhere.

23:59.671 --> 24:01.764
Let's stop playing these games,
Captain.

24:01.873 --> 24:04.137
You've scanned my ship;
l've scanned yours.

24:04.209 --> 24:05.471
We each know

24:05.544 --> 24:08.308
the other is building a vessel
to retrieve the probe.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.872
What you don't know is that my
vessel will be ready to launch

24:12.017 --> 24:13.314
in less than two days.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.716
You're too far behind.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.720
Well, if you're so far ahead,

24:16.788 --> 24:19.154
why bother
trying to scare us away?

24:19.224 --> 24:23.888
Just trying to save you
the embarrassment of losing.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.527
You think they're
really two days away?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.532
He's probably bluffing,

24:29.634 --> 24:30.999
but we're not going
to take any chances.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.592
We've got to speed up
construction somehow.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.695
We'd also better find a way
to shore up our shields

24:34.806 --> 24:36.603
in case Vrelk decides
to do any more venting.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.302
Good idea.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.071
Janeway to Lieutenant Torres.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.672
Computer, locate
Lieutenant Torres.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.216
Lieutenant Torres
is in Holodeck 1.

24:46.284 --> 24:49.219
Get down there.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.447
Warning.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.752
Hull microfractures are present

24:52.824 --> 24:55.190
in zones one, two,
three and four.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.955
Hull breach is imminent.

24:57.028 --> 24:58.962
Repeat: Hull microfractures

24:59.097 --> 25:03.397
are present in zones one,
two, three and four.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.231
Hull breach is imminent.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.464
Computer, freeze program.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.237
B'Elanna.

25:13.311 --> 25:16.007
Chakotay to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.732
What am l doing here?

25:35.800 --> 25:38.325
You had an accident
on the holodeck.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.339
How long was l out?

25:42.407 --> 25:44.238
Almost 12 hours.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.280
l'd better get back to work.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.316
Not just yet.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.316
Why?

25:53.385 --> 25:54.716
The Captain's asked
me to keep you here.

25:54.786 --> 25:56.185
But l feel fine.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.180
Would you excuse us,
please, Doctor?

26:04.362 --> 26:05.454
Captain, what's going on?

26:08.867 --> 26:11.062
When the Doctor examined you...

26:13.405 --> 26:16.670
he found evidence
of internal bleeding,

26:16.741 --> 26:21.838
fractured vertebrae,
contusions, cranial trauma.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.847
l guess the accident
was pretty serious.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.146
The injuries l'm talking about
didn't happen recently.

26:27.218 --> 26:30.745
Some of them are weeks,
even months old.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.255
Well, l'm an engineer.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.519
l've had my share
of bumps and bruises.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.686
But you didn't seek
treatment for any of these.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.252
l don't run to Sick Bay
every time l stub my toe.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.232
Some of these injuries were
life-threatening, B'Elanna.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.564
Do l look like l'm dying?

26:46.538 --> 26:49.939
The Doctor says many of
the wounds were treated...

26:50.041 --> 26:52.441
by someone
with the medical expertise

26:52.510 --> 26:54.501
of a first-year nursing student.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.412
Oh, that's ridiculous.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.745
ls it?

26:59.818 --> 27:02.753
We investigated
today's accident.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.782
You turned off
the safety protocols

27:06.858 --> 27:08.519
during the holo-simulation.

27:08.593 --> 27:09.560
Why?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.562
We have
a microfracture problem.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.963
With the safety protocols on,
there's no way to be sure

27:15.033 --> 27:17.365
what would happen
during a real flight.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.097
You don't really expect me
to believe that, do you?

27:20.205 --> 27:22.469
Are you calling me a liar?

27:22.540 --> 27:25.441
According to the holodeck logs,
you've been spending

27:25.510 --> 27:28.240
a lot of time there
over the last few months.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.213
lf l were to check...

27:36.021 --> 27:38.285
would l find
that you've been running

27:38.356 --> 27:40.824
other programs
without safety protocols?

27:40.892 --> 27:43.861
Would you like to look
at my personal logs as well?

27:43.928 --> 27:46.192
B'Elanna, l'm worried about you.

27:46.264 --> 27:48.664
lf there's something wrong,
l want to help.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.724
Nothing's wrong.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.028
Okay?

27:54.139 --> 27:56.107
No. lt's not okay.

27:56.207 --> 27:57.299
And until you decide

27:57.409 --> 27:59.502
to be more forthcoming,
you'll remain

27:59.577 --> 28:01.306
under the Doctor's supervision,

28:01.413 --> 28:03.847
which means
you're off the shuttle project.

28:03.948 --> 28:04.915
l'm sorry.

28:06.284 --> 28:07.444
l'm not.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.988
Now l know
there's something wrong.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.036
Engines are operating at close
to 90 percent efficiency.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.508
Seven's got her new
weapon system on line

28:32.577 --> 28:35.512
and if we can just solve
that microfracture problem,

28:35.580 --> 28:37.047
we'll be ready to go.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.047
Keep on it.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.105
Now...

28:41.086 --> 28:43.418
let's talk about B'Elanna.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.620
Tom, you had no idea
about these injuries

28:48.693 --> 28:50.058
or how she got them?

28:51.463 --> 28:53.556
She never complained
about being hurt.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.156
But then again, she's barely
speaking to me lately.

28:57.702 --> 28:59.465
lt's almost as if she's been

28:59.571 --> 29:01.903
intentionally trying
to hurt herself.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.405
You think all these injuries

29:03.441 --> 29:05.136
have been happening
on the holodeck?

29:05.210 --> 29:06.199
Well, where else?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.972
lf they'd happened
while she was working

29:08.046 --> 29:11.174
as she claims, somebody would've
filed an injury report.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.650
Any idea what sort of programs
she's been running?

29:17.455 --> 29:19.548
You're thinking
the same thing l am.

29:21.659 --> 29:22.819
l hate to go digging around

29:22.927 --> 29:24.724
in someone's personal
holodeck programs,

29:24.796 --> 29:26.354
but if she won't tell us
what's going on

29:26.431 --> 29:27.762
l don't think
we have much choice.

29:27.832 --> 29:29.356
Tom, what do you think?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.028
He's right.

29:36.541 --> 29:37.940
Start digging.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.095
l'm sleeping.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.691
Oh.

30:06.738 --> 30:07.830
Hi.

30:07.939 --> 30:09.236
Hi.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.437
l thought you were the Doctor
making a house call.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.811
He let you
out of the cell block, huh?

30:19.851 --> 30:24.686
He thinks familiar surroundings
will help speed my recovery.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.815
Recovery from what?

30:26.891 --> 30:28.415
That's what l said.

30:28.493 --> 30:32.554
He thinks l'm suffering
from clinical depression.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.564
Are you depressed?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.691
What are you,

30:37.802 --> 30:39.963
the new Ship's Counselor?

30:42.473 --> 30:44.373
No.

30:44.442 --> 30:45.909
Just a friend.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.740
This whole thing
is so ridiculous.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.111
l don't report a few scrapes

30:51.182 --> 30:55.585
and suddenly Janeway thinks
there's something wrong with me.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.211
Typical Starfleet, huh?

30:57.288 --> 30:59.449
You have been running
holodeck programs

30:59.524 --> 31:01.082
without safety protocols.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.322
A few.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.592
But l haven't put
anybody else at risk

31:08.666 --> 31:10.861
and it's nothing
that l can't handle.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.038
Tell you what.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.607
What do you say you and l pay
a little visit to the holodeck?

31:17.675 --> 31:20.371
You can show me some of the
programs you've been running.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.377
Right now?

31:21.446 --> 31:23.539
Sure. Maybe if l see
what you've been up to,

31:23.615 --> 31:26.516
l can convince the Captain
there's nothing to worry about.

31:26.584 --> 31:29.280
She's taken away
my holodeck privileges.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.584
Consider them restored.

31:45.670 --> 31:49.572
Computer, activate holoprogram
Torres Zeta-1.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.006
Program activated.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.302
What are you doing?

31:53.378 --> 31:54.470
What...?

32:01.252 --> 32:02.742
Computer, freeze program.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.811
Computer, belay that command!

32:08.993 --> 32:10.153
Turn it off!

32:10.228 --> 32:12.059
Not until you tell me
what it is.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.688
You know what it is!

32:20.738 --> 32:22.205
Who's this?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.207
Li Paz.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.708
Don't you recognize him?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.335
Oh, l recognize them all.

32:27.412 --> 32:28.538
Meyer...

32:28.613 --> 32:29.637
Nelson...

32:29.714 --> 32:31.306
Sahreen.

32:31.382 --> 32:32.576
You created a program

32:32.650 --> 32:35.244
to watch all our Maquis friends
get slaughtered.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.878
What l want to know is why.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.512
l thought we came
down here to talk

32:39.590 --> 32:40.614
about safety protocols.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.886
This has nothing
to do with that.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.154
l'm not so sure.

32:43.227 --> 32:45.923
The logs show you only ran
this program for 47 seconds--

32:45.997 --> 32:48.465
the day after l gave you
the news about the massacre.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.626
Then you shut it down
and started running

32:50.735 --> 32:52.896
the most dangerous programs
you could find

32:53.004 --> 32:54.335
with the safeties off.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.337
Why?!

32:55.406 --> 32:56.668
This is ridiculous.
l'm leaving.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.003
Computer, seal the doors.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.236
You can't do this!

32:59.310 --> 33:00.368
The hell l can't.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.174
You're not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.015
B'Elanna...

33:07.085 --> 33:10.020
why are you intentionally
trying to hurt yourself?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.423
l don't know.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.652
Are you trying
to commit suicide?

33:16.995 --> 33:17.893
No.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.257
Then why?

33:20.698 --> 33:22.393
Because...

33:22.467 --> 33:27.200
because if l sprain my ankle,
at least l feel something.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.136
What do you mean?

33:29.207 --> 33:32.176
l'm not trying to kill myself.

33:32.276 --> 33:35.939
l'm trying to see
if l'm still alive.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.005
l don't understand.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.750
When you look
at those corpses...

33:47.825 --> 33:49.486
how do you feel?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.832
Sad.

33:54.899 --> 33:56.423
Angry.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.992
Maybe a little guilty that l
wasn't there to die with them.

34:00.104 --> 34:01.093
Not me.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.036
l don't feel anything at all.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.473
B'Elanna, the Maquis
were like our adopted family.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.478
l can understand you trying to
block out that kind of pain...

34:08.545 --> 34:11.071
You don't understand.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.810
lt's not just the pain.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.375
l don't feel anything--

34:15.453 --> 34:17.648
not about my dead friends,

34:17.722 --> 34:19.382
not about Tom...

34:19.456 --> 34:21.652
you, my job.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.851
Maybe you're afraid

34:22.927 --> 34:25.554
if you let yourself
start to feel something,

34:25.630 --> 34:27.530
you might not be able to stop.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.625
You can't just shut off
your emotions, B'Elanna.

34:32.703 --> 34:34.068
Sooner or later...

34:34.138 --> 34:37.164
you're going to have
to let yourself grieve.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.208
Why?

34:39.277 --> 34:42.041
Just so l can go through it
all over again?

34:42.112 --> 34:43.978
What are you talking about?

34:47.585 --> 34:51.043
When l was six,
my father walked out on me.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.750
When l was 19,
l got kicked out of Starfleet.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.623
A few years later, l got
separated from the Maquis.

34:56.694 --> 34:58.559
And just when l
start to feel safe,

34:58.629 --> 35:00.722
you tell me that all
of our old friends

35:00.832 --> 35:03.699
have been slaughtered.

35:03.768 --> 35:07.727
The way l figure it, l've lost
every family l've ever had.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.535
B'Elanna...

35:10.608 --> 35:14.237
you have a new family now...
here on Voyager

35:14.312 --> 35:16.712
and you're not going to lose us.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.772
You're stuck with us.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.785
You can't promise me that.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.878
No, l suppose l can't.

35:24.021 --> 35:25.989
Losing people is inevitable,

35:26.057 --> 35:30.323
and sometimes it happens
sooner than we expect...

35:30.394 --> 35:33.386
but l can promise you
that the people on this ship

35:33.464 --> 35:35.898
aren't about to let you
stop living your life

35:36.000 --> 35:37.900
or break your neck
on the holodeck.

35:38.035 --> 35:41.129
You're going to have to find
another way to deal with this.

35:45.109 --> 35:47.475
l don't know how.

35:48.946 --> 35:50.743
Then we'll figure it out...

35:50.815 --> 35:52.840
together.

35:55.019 --> 35:57.214
Commander Chakotay,
we're under attack.

35:57.288 --> 36:00.155
Report to the Bridge
immediately.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.384
You'd better go.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.542
Why are they suddenly
picking a fight?

36:28.619 --> 36:31.588
l believe they're attempting
to distract us, Commander,

36:31.656 --> 36:34.386
while they launch
their new shuttlecraft.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.608
The Malon vessel
is 42,000 kilometers

36:51.676 --> 36:53.143
from the probe and closing.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.542
We can still catch them.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.239
Bridge to Lieutenant Paris.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.303
Paris here.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.643
We've got to launch now

36:58.716 --> 37:00.980
if we're going
to get to the probe first.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.143
Are you ready?

37:02.186 --> 37:03.278
Yes, ma'am.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.185
l'll begin
the prelaunch sequence.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.247
What about
the microfracture problem?

37:07.325 --> 37:08.485
We're keeping an eye on it,

37:08.559 --> 37:10.186
but we sure could use
an extra hand.

37:10.261 --> 37:11.523
Chakotay's on his way.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.399
Chakotay...

37:25.509 --> 37:26.498
let me go.

37:26.611 --> 37:27.737
B'Elanna, l'm in a hurry.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.474
l am not out to get myself hurt
if that's what you're thinking.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.209
l just want to do my job.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.717
l thought you weren't interested
in your job anymore.

37:34.785 --> 37:39.154
lf that hull breaches,
l should be there.

37:39.223 --> 37:41.157
l'm still the best engineer
we've got.

37:41.225 --> 37:42.624
Not lately.

37:42.693 --> 37:45.161
l can do this.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.288
l need to do this.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.816
40 seconds to launch.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.614
Powering impulse engines.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.657
Stand by to bring aft thrusters
on line.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.818
B'Elanna.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.555
l heard you might need some help

38:19.630 --> 38:21.222
keeping this thing
from falling apart.

38:22.767 --> 38:23.961
Welcome aboard.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.830
Vorik, you're in my seat.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.404
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

38:33.577 --> 38:34.771
20 seconds to launch.

38:34.845 --> 38:37.439
Get that hatch closed.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.278
Hatch sealed.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.817
Give me aft thrusters.

38:40.885 --> 38:43.115
Aft thrusters enabled.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.620
Ten seconds.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.815
All right.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.290
Let's see what this baby can do.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.792
Five...

38:50.861 --> 38:52.158
four...

38:52.229 --> 38:53.196
three...

38:53.264 --> 38:54.663
two...

38:54.732 --> 38:55.460
one.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.207
The Delta Flyer is away,
Captain.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.804
How long till they overtake
the Malon shuttle?

39:10.881 --> 39:14.044
At present velocity,
approximately three minutes.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.223
We're in.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.819
Structural integrity's
at 92 percent.

39:25.896 --> 39:29.832
There's the Malon shuttle--
200 kilometers off the port bow

39:29.967 --> 39:32.435
and 3,000 kilometers
from the probe.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.663
We'll catch them.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.102
B'Elanna, how's the hull?

39:35.172 --> 39:38.767
Structural integrity's down
about 12 percent.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.308
They're launching
spatial charges.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.373
Shields holding.

39:47.451 --> 39:48.884
They want to play dirty.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.614
Let's show them what a little

39:50.688 --> 39:52.451
Borg-inspired weaponry
can do.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.354
Acknowledged.

39:54.425 --> 39:57.588
Loading photonic missiles.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.862
We've lost power
to secondary systems.

40:01.932 --> 40:02.694
Fire.

40:05.803 --> 40:06.895
Three direct hits.

40:07.004 --> 40:08.562
They're losing attitude control.

40:08.672 --> 40:09.764
They're pulling up.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.273
Nice shooting, Seven.

40:12.710 --> 40:15.042
l'm taking us
down to the target.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.603
Harry, get ready
to grab the probe.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.740
Still out of transport range.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.285
We're losing integrity.
50 percent...

40:22.353 --> 40:23.650
forty...

40:23.721 --> 40:25.746
lf you can hold us together
for another half a minute,

40:25.823 --> 40:27.313
we'll be within range
of the target.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.484
We still need
to survive the ascent.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.494
One thing at a time.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.961
We're losing
structural integrity.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.292
lt's down to 25 percent.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.627
Harry, prepare to lock on.

40:37.134 --> 40:40.501
We've got microfractures
forming-- aft starboard hull

40:40.571 --> 40:41.629
zone two.

40:41.739 --> 40:42.967
l've got a lock.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.405
Beaming the probe
into the cargo hold.

40:46.477 --> 40:47.444
Got it.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.410
lnitiating rapid ascent.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.547
Harry, l need
those secondary systems

40:55.619 --> 40:56.608
back on line.

40:56.687 --> 40:58.382
l can't. They're fried.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.149
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.518
Patching a hole before it opens.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.147
That'll never hold.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.384
lt'll hold a minute or two,

41:34.458 --> 41:36.085
and with any luck,
that's all we need.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.149
Seven, take over here.

41:47.104 --> 41:49.004
l need an EPS relay.

41:49.139 --> 41:51.972
Uh, there's one in the
transporter control circuitry.

41:57.581 --> 41:58.809
The panel is sealed.

41:58.883 --> 42:00.316
Good. Get away from it.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.424
l need a phaser.

42:39.924 --> 42:40.948
Watch out.

42:41.091 --> 42:44.151
l don't know
if this is going to work.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.039
Glad you decided to come along.

43:13.190 --> 43:14.657
The Delta Flyer has docked.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.158
And the Malon?

43:16.226 --> 43:18.160
They're a little preoccupied.

43:18.228 --> 43:21.288
Seems their shuttlecraft's
having a problem

43:21.365 --> 43:24.357
climbing out of the
gas giant's atmosphere.

43:24.468 --> 43:27.198
Get us out of here, Ensign--
warp 2.

43:27.304 --> 43:28.293
Aye, Captain.

43:40.050 --> 43:41.017
B'Elanna.

43:43.487 --> 43:45.921
l heard you did a hell of a job.

43:48.759 --> 43:50.249
So? How are you?

43:50.327 --> 43:54.388
You mean am l back
to my old charming self?

43:54.465 --> 43:56.296
l don't know.

43:57.868 --> 43:59.529
Give it time.

44:02.539 --> 44:05.064
Chakotay.

44:05.175 --> 44:08.770
What you did
down in the holodeck today...

44:08.846 --> 44:10.609
thanks.

44:12.616 --> 44:15.676
But if you ever do anything
like that again,

44:15.753 --> 44:17.277
l'll break your neck.

44:31.735 --> 44:33.259
Computer...

44:33.370 --> 44:37.170
one stack of banana pancakes
with maple syrup.

44:38.305 --> 44:44.863
