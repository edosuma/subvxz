00:00.641 --> 00:02.801
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:02.884 --> 00:05.984
I think that our fight had more
to do with my father than us.

00:06.121 --> 00:08.755
<i>Catherine, he brainwashed me,</i>
<i>he took away my life,</i>

00:08.789 --> 00:11.138
my memories, then he made me
kill for him.

00:11.139 --> 00:12.639
And when he was
done with me,

00:12.673 --> 00:13.940
he tried to kill me.

00:13.975 --> 00:15.109
So I'm not giving him
another chance.

00:15.143 --> 00:16.543
I know he is a
terrible man.

00:16.577 --> 00:18.445
And he has only done
terrible things to you.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.713
But you can't cross
that line again.

00:19.747 --> 00:21.215
Otherwise...

00:21.249 --> 00:22.316
Otherwise what?

00:22.350 --> 00:23.750
You'll lose your humanity.

00:23.784 --> 00:24.984
You are lost
to everything

00:25.019 --> 00:26.452
we have fought so hard

00:26.487 --> 00:28.388
to keep you from becoming.

00:28.422 --> 00:29.622
Hands up!

00:34.361 --> 00:35.461
Let him go.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.296
You still have a choice.

00:37.331 --> 00:38.631
You can choose to walk away

00:38.665 --> 00:40.499
and save yourself.

00:40.533 --> 00:42.234
Save us.

00:45.304 --> 00:46.938
<i>Ready when you are.</i>

00:46.972 --> 00:49.674
Detective Catherine Chandler,

00:49.708 --> 00:52.477
First Grade, NYPD,
125th Precinct.

00:52.512 --> 00:53.678
Great, thanks.

00:53.712 --> 00:54.913
I'm Special Agent
Brian Hendricks,

00:54.947 --> 00:56.647
Internal Affairs, FBI.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.316
So like I said, when one
of our agents is involved

00:59.351 --> 01:01.985
in criminal activity,
we open a pro forma inquiry.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.787
And that's all this is, okay?

01:03.821 --> 01:05.689
Okay.

01:05.723 --> 01:08.959
So, um, tell us
about the events of last night

01:08.993 --> 01:11.862
and the arrest
of Agent Reynolds.

01:11.896 --> 01:14.097
We suspected him
of being connected

01:14.131 --> 01:15.631
to several suspicious deaths.

01:15.666 --> 01:17.200
We ran a sting operation

01:17.234 --> 01:19.936
that caused him
to incriminate himself.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.272
I should never have taken you
off of my list.

01:22.306 --> 01:24.941
I should've had you killed, too.
Got you.

01:24.975 --> 01:26.642
Mm-hmm, and as you know,

01:26.677 --> 01:29.178
because of your good work,
Agent Reynolds has

01:29.212 --> 01:30.812
already confessed to...

01:30.846 --> 01:33.348
<i>conspiracy to commit murder,</i>
<i>including,</i>

01:33.383 --> 01:34.950
uh, Zachary Hayes.

01:36.319 --> 01:37.852
Is that correct?
Yes.

01:37.887 --> 01:39.555
Mr. Hayes was
one of the victims

01:39.589 --> 01:41.356
<i>that we wanted</i>
<i>to connect him to.</i>

01:41.391 --> 01:42.458
Then, while

01:42.492 --> 01:43.725
<i>driving him in, you were...</i>

01:43.759 --> 01:45.025
Hands up!

01:45.060 --> 01:46.794
...in a car
accident, correct?

01:46.828 --> 01:49.830
Yes, I swerved the car
to avoid a...

01:51.567 --> 01:53.867
... dog that ran out
in front of me.

01:53.902 --> 01:55.269
Watch out!

01:56.771 --> 01:58.206
Ah.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.274
Then Agent Reynolds escaped.

02:02.510 --> 02:05.512
But you
apprehended him.

02:05.546 --> 02:06.913
I-I'm assuming
these injuries stemmed

02:06.947 --> 02:08.381
from the car crash, right?

02:10.283 --> 02:13.320
I guess so. I don't know
what else it could have been.

02:16.523 --> 02:17.889
Let him go.

02:19.058 --> 02:20.593
Hmm.

02:20.627 --> 02:22.328
Anything else
you'd like to add, Detective?

02:22.362 --> 02:24.330
<i>Please don't.</i>

02:24.364 --> 02:25.731
I am begging you.

02:31.471 --> 02:33.104
<i>Detective?</i>

02:33.139 --> 02:34.539
Detective?

02:34.573 --> 02:36.073
Um, no.

02:36.108 --> 02:38.209
No, sorry, I just...

02:38.244 --> 02:39.777
Yeah, I think that's-that's it.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.247
All right, great.

02:42.281 --> 02:44.215
I still need to, uh,
check the arrest scene,

02:44.250 --> 02:45.517
review Agent Reynolds'
confession.

02:45.551 --> 02:48.918
But it all seems
pretty open and shut.

02:48.953 --> 02:51.588
Probably the last
you'll see of me.

02:51.623 --> 02:53.857
Great. Thank you.

02:53.891 --> 02:56.693
Oh, Detective?

02:56.727 --> 03:00.063
I know it's never easy
bringing down one of our own,

03:00.097 --> 03:01.898
especially
when it's your father,

03:01.932 --> 03:05.034
but you have my
utmost respect.

03:05.068 --> 03:06.636
And the Agency's thanks.

03:06.670 --> 03:09.038
Thank you.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.810
How'd it go?

03:14.844 --> 03:16.579
Professionally,
I think we're fine.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.781
Personally, I think I'm
having a nervous breakdown.

03:18.815 --> 03:19.915
Just breathe.
I can't.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.384
I am going into palpitations.

03:22.418 --> 03:25.086
Your father confessed,
not just because he was guilty,

03:25.120 --> 03:27.422
but also to take
the heat off of you.

03:27.456 --> 03:29.157
You're not gonna
get caught.

03:29.192 --> 03:31.226
I'm not worried
about being exposed.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.994
I mean, obviously I am,

03:33.028 --> 03:34.429
but this is more about Vincent.

03:34.463 --> 03:35.930
He did not give you
a choice, Catherine.

03:35.964 --> 03:36.930
He would've killed Reynolds.

03:36.964 --> 03:38.165
You had to shoot him.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.900
And if I had to do it again,
I would.

03:39.934 --> 03:41.569
But it doesn't mean
I feel good about it.

03:41.603 --> 03:43.904
I was clear with him about
what the stakes were.

03:43.938 --> 03:46.340
This wasn't just about him
doing the right thing,

03:46.374 --> 03:48.075
or not caving to his beast side.

03:48.109 --> 03:49.710
I just...

03:49.712 --> 03:52.812
I can't believe
at he didn't choose us.

03:54.081 --> 03:55.481
So what are you gonna do?

03:56.917 --> 03:58.518
I am moving on.

03:58.552 --> 04:01.053
Taking my life back finally.

04:01.088 --> 04:02.555
You deserve to.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.889
Especially after everything
you've been through

04:03.924 --> 04:05.958
with Vincent.
I know, but...

04:05.992 --> 04:07.493
I have to figure out
why I still feel

04:07.528 --> 04:09.294
so responsible for him.

04:09.329 --> 04:10.629
How do I get past that?

04:10.663 --> 04:11.830
Responsible how?

04:11.832 --> 04:13.298
I don't know.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.733
It's like this knot
in my stomach,

04:14.767 --> 04:15.967
and it won't go away.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.636
It's hard to explain.

04:17.670 --> 04:20.404
Maybe it has to do
with making sure

04:20.440 --> 04:21.707
he's gonna be all right.

04:21.741 --> 04:23.007
I mean,
after the shooting.

04:23.042 --> 04:24.408
Maybe.

04:24.443 --> 04:26.477
I'm sorry to unload
all this on you.

04:26.511 --> 04:27.878
You're not at all, Catherine.

04:27.912 --> 04:29.813
You need to know
that I'm here for you.

04:29.848 --> 04:31.215
Whenever you need me.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:42.025 --> 04:43.092
How is it?

04:43.127 --> 04:45.328
It's still bleeding.

04:45.363 --> 04:46.596
The bullet must've nicked

04:46.631 --> 04:48.665
the blood vessel
when it passed through.

04:48.699 --> 04:50.533
I'm gonna need more gauze.

04:50.568 --> 04:52.369
This is all there is.

04:52.403 --> 04:55.037
Hey, don't worry, all right?

04:55.072 --> 04:56.705
I used to be a doctor, remember?

04:56.740 --> 04:58.774
But don't doctors make
the worst patients?

04:58.808 --> 04:59.775
I'm calling
an ambulance

04:59.809 --> 05:00.776
No!

05:00.810 --> 05:02.678
No.

05:02.712 --> 05:04.680
Sorry, but that is
not an option.

05:04.714 --> 05:06.248
Why?

05:06.283 --> 05:08.450
Because hospitals are forced
to alert the police

05:08.485 --> 05:10.419
whenever a gunshot victim
is admitted.

05:10.453 --> 05:11.787
Okay? And that means
background checks.

05:11.821 --> 05:12.787
So?

05:12.821 --> 05:14.455
So, Vincent Keller is dead.

05:14.490 --> 05:15.490
Do you understand?

05:17.159 --> 05:19.727
Killed in Afghanistan
over a decade ago.

05:19.762 --> 05:22.029
I can't risk being exposed.

05:22.063 --> 05:23.765
Why not?

05:23.799 --> 05:25.400
I get you not wanting people
to find out

05:25.434 --> 05:27.067
that you're a-a beast,
but they wouldn't.

05:27.102 --> 05:29.035
They would just find out
that you're alive.

05:29.069 --> 05:30.804
And I don't see what's
wrong with that.

05:30.838 --> 05:32.906
What's wrong with it is
they'll ask questions.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.140
Okay? A lot of them.

05:34.175 --> 05:36.142
Where have you been
for the past decade?

05:36.177 --> 05:38.278
Why have you been hiding?
What have you been doing?

05:38.313 --> 05:41.415
And all of those answers
lead back to beasts.

05:41.449 --> 05:42.716
Not necessarily.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.383
We can come up
with a cover story.

05:44.418 --> 05:45.951
Like amnesia-- it's real.

05:49.823 --> 05:51.123
I need more gauze.

05:51.157 --> 05:52.458
I'm serious, Vincent.

05:52.492 --> 05:53.992
What is the alternative?

05:54.027 --> 05:55.661
You live in the shadows.

05:55.696 --> 05:57.797
You hide out for
another ten years? 20?

05:57.831 --> 05:59.231
I don't want to
live like that,

05:59.265 --> 06:00.265
and neither should you.

06:01.934 --> 06:05.403
You're-you're afraid,
aren't you?

06:05.438 --> 06:07.138
I can sense it.

06:07.172 --> 06:09.841
And not just about the beast
part of it all; something else.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.610
Tori, all I know how to do
is hide, okay?

06:12.645 --> 06:14.278
And I can control that.

06:14.313 --> 06:15.980
I decide who gets to see me

06:16.014 --> 06:17.314
and who doesn't.

06:17.349 --> 06:18.515
Friend or foe.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.351
But being exposed?

06:20.385 --> 06:22.720
Yes, it does scare me.

06:24.622 --> 06:26.590
Especially now
everything has changed.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.561
Vincent?

06:43.240 --> 06:45.475
You have a lot of
nerve coming here.

06:45.509 --> 06:47.510
Tori, I didn't
come here to fight.

06:47.544 --> 06:50.111
How could you shoot him?

06:50.145 --> 06:52.146
I thought you loved him.

06:54.016 --> 06:55.617
I did.

06:56.919 --> 06:59.821
You should not be up.

07:01.156 --> 07:03.358
I'm okay.

07:05.326 --> 07:07.261
Now, listen, do you mind?

07:13.368 --> 07:15.870
I just came here
to make sure you're okay.

07:15.904 --> 07:17.538
I'm fine.

07:17.572 --> 07:20.040
You don't look fine.

07:20.074 --> 07:22.709
Well, I'm not really
your problem anymore, am I?

07:28.682 --> 07:30.917
Don't blame me for this.
Why not?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.019
You're the one who pulled the trigger.
I warned you.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.220
I gave you a choice.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.855
No, you chose him over me.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.355
I chose right over wrong.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.990
Your father tried to kill me!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.158
I couldn't let you kill him!

07:40.192 --> 07:41.560
So you shot me instead?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.963
Do you think I wanted to?

07:48.267 --> 07:50.736
Look, Vincent, I told you
that I couldn't be

07:50.770 --> 07:52.070
the only one fighting for us,

07:52.104 --> 07:54.505
and I meant that.

07:56.241 --> 07:58.576
I really didn't want it
to end this way.

08:01.079 --> 08:03.013
But I guess it has.

08:04.983 --> 08:07.351
Looks like it.

08:09.153 --> 08:12.221
At least you don't have
to cover for me anymore.

08:36.102 --> 08:37.534
I want to get back to work.

08:37.568 --> 08:38.937
Police work, my work.

08:38.971 --> 08:41.304
As opposed to beasts.
Yes! And...

08:41.339 --> 08:43.107
if you don't mind, let's not use
the B-word anymore.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.608
I need to move on.

08:44.642 --> 08:45.743
Right.

08:45.777 --> 08:47.211
Tess, listen to me.

08:47.245 --> 08:48.578
I know I've been all beast

08:48.613 --> 08:49.747
all the time
since Vincent was taken...

08:49.781 --> 08:51.949
Actually,
since before he was taken.

08:51.983 --> 08:53.617
But I mean it when I say
I want to move on.

08:53.651 --> 08:54.718
I am done with it.

08:56.287 --> 08:58.621
Yes, I-I know, obviously,

08:58.655 --> 09:00.890
I can't just erase
my feelings for him.

09:00.924 --> 09:02.391
That'll take time, but...

09:02.425 --> 09:04.093
I did everything I could.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.561
I know that.

09:05.595 --> 09:07.130
Okay.

09:07.164 --> 09:10.099
Great.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.735
Yeah, it's a little scary,
but it's also kind of exciting.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.636
I mean, now I've got all
this free time on my hands

09:14.670 --> 09:15.804
without Vincent, but...

09:15.838 --> 09:18.240
I knew there was a but.

09:18.274 --> 09:19.474
No, it's-it's not
what you think.

09:19.508 --> 09:21.009
It's just...

09:21.043 --> 09:22.844
There's something
that's holding me back.

09:22.879 --> 09:25.113
I don't know, maybe I feel
guilty or something.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.315
Guilty like what? Like you
shouldn't have shot him?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.916
No, it's...

09:28.950 --> 09:30.818
I don't know what it is.

09:30.852 --> 09:31.986
It just happened.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.420
You have to give yourself time

09:33.454 --> 09:35.256
to sort through
your feelings, okay?

09:35.290 --> 09:37.258
I'm still dealing
with my feelings for Joe.

09:37.292 --> 09:38.259
It's been what,
six months now?

09:38.293 --> 09:39.426
Yeah, I have to be patient.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.594
Yep.

09:40.628 --> 09:42.163
But what Vincent said is true.

09:42.197 --> 09:43.964
At least I don't have to cover
for him anymore.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.598
Detective Chandler?

09:45.632 --> 09:48.034
Agent Hendricks would like to
ask you some more questions.

09:48.068 --> 09:49.602
Is there a problem?

09:49.636 --> 09:51.437
Maybe. Couple things came up.

09:51.471 --> 09:53.106
Wanted to make sure that
I have your story straight.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.874
Let's do this one

09:54.909 --> 09:57.110
in the interrogation room,
shall we?

10:11.324 --> 10:13.591
Okay, okay, I'm coming!

10:15.361 --> 10:17.561
We need your help.
Why?

10:17.595 --> 10:19.030
Wait-- what the hell happened?

10:19.064 --> 10:20.965
I got shot.
By Catherine.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.066
What?!
It's not that bad.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.567
You're such a guy.

10:23.601 --> 10:25.169
It's really bad.
Here, sit down.

10:25.204 --> 10:27.671
Cat shot you?
Uh-huh.

10:27.706 --> 10:30.241
I need you to get the sutures
and the medical kit.

10:30.275 --> 10:32.009
Why would she ever do that?

10:33.544 --> 10:34.905
- Long story.
- More importantly,

10:34.912 --> 10:36.313
we need to stop
the bleeding

10:36.347 --> 10:37.914
'cause you won't go
to the hospital.

10:37.949 --> 10:39.649
Hospital?
He can't go to the hospital.

10:39.683 --> 10:41.017
Okay, what is
with you two?

10:41.052 --> 10:42.052
Would you rather
he died?

10:42.086 --> 10:43.553
I am not gonna die.

10:43.587 --> 10:44.888
You are if you bleed out.

10:46.858 --> 10:49.424
Maybe you <i>should</i> go
to the hospital.

10:49.459 --> 10:51.193
No, you need to go
to the hospital.

10:51.228 --> 10:55.097
Get me antibiotics,
painkillers and blood.

10:55.131 --> 10:57.366
Blood? What, you mean,
like, O Positive Beast?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.501
JT, you're a professor.
I don't know,

10:59.535 --> 11:01.536
go to the university hospital,
break into the blood bank.

11:01.571 --> 11:03.572
Break in? Last time, bodies;
this time, blood.

11:03.606 --> 11:04.840
I-I'll never get my tenure!

11:04.874 --> 11:06.574
Hurry!

11:09.611 --> 11:11.379
What-what do you
want me to do?

11:11.413 --> 11:13.848
Okay, you're gonna need
to squeeze the skin together.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.717
Okay. Okay...

11:19.721 --> 11:22.356
Sorry.

11:25.159 --> 11:27.694
What are we gonna do?

11:27.728 --> 11:30.130
I mean, like you said,
everything's changed.

11:30.164 --> 11:32.366
Like it or not,

11:32.400 --> 11:33.566
we're in this together.

11:39.506 --> 11:40.940
Answer it.

11:40.974 --> 11:42.775
You're not in hiding.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.451
Hello?

11:53.485 --> 11:55.086
Ms. Windsor?
This is Laura Scott.

11:55.121 --> 11:57.222
I'm an associate
with the law firm

11:57.256 --> 11:58.489
representing
your father's estate.

11:58.524 --> 12:00.892
Oh, hi. Uh, listen, can I...?

12:00.927 --> 12:02.460
I just wanted to confirm

12:02.494 --> 12:04.062
our appointment for 1:00 today

12:04.096 --> 12:05.430
regarding the
Chelsea Curios sale.

12:05.464 --> 12:07.232
Uh, I'm sorry, the what?

12:07.266 --> 12:10.234
Your father agreed to sell one
of his smaller subsidiaries,

12:10.268 --> 12:13.070
and escrow closes today.
We need you to sign the papers.

12:13.104 --> 12:14.571
Listen, I-I can't today, okay?
So...

12:14.605 --> 12:17.007
Ms. Windsor, you
don't have a choice.

12:17.042 --> 12:19.410
If you, as trustee,

12:19.444 --> 12:22.179
don't sign, then we'll be in
default, and I can assure you,

12:22.213 --> 12:23.914
all legal hell will break loose.

12:23.949 --> 12:27.951
Listen, um, you're gonna have
to deal with this, okay?

12:27.985 --> 12:29.218
I'm... I'm busy.

12:31.121 --> 12:34.023
Ms. Windsor, we know
about your father.

12:34.058 --> 12:37.593
About who he really was, or
more specifically, what he was.

12:37.627 --> 12:40.129
And unless you want the rest
of the world to know, too,

12:40.522 --> 12:42.468
don't be late.

12:44.732 --> 12:46.452
Is everything ok?

12:47.736 --> 12:49.071
Yeah, um...

12:49.105 --> 12:50.405
I'm-I'm fine.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.773
You sure?

12:53.843 --> 12:55.410
Yeah. Uh,

12:55.445 --> 12:57.411
my dad just needed me
to sign some papers.

12:57.446 --> 12:58.579
He made me a...

12:58.613 --> 12:59.746
a trustee or
something

12:59.781 --> 13:01.248
for one of
his companies.

13:01.283 --> 13:02.816
So why's your heart racing?

13:02.851 --> 13:04.651
Is it?

13:04.686 --> 13:06.387
It's probably 'cause
I'm so worried about you.

13:06.421 --> 13:08.655
I don't want to leave
you for even a minute.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.557
I'll be right back.

13:10.592 --> 13:12.726
Just rest.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.531
No, as I said before, there was

13:18.565 --> 13:20.566
no one else present when
I arrested Agent Reynolds.

13:20.601 --> 13:21.767
How about after
the crash?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.370
No.

13:23.404 --> 13:25.905
Are you sure?
Yes.

13:28.709 --> 13:32.511
Detective, I feel compelled
to remind you

13:32.545 --> 13:34.513
that you are under oath here.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.615
I'm sorry, are you accusing her
of something?

13:36.649 --> 13:37.916
Just asking questions.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.385
'Cause I thought this was just

13:39.419 --> 13:40.886
a pro forma inquiry.
It was.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.888
Now it's an investigation.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.057
Wait. Why?

13:44.082 --> 13:45.390
Because you're not
telling me the truth.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.690
That's why, Detective.

13:46.725 --> 13:47.691
And that's based on?

13:48.793 --> 13:50.028
Amongst other things...

13:52.297 --> 13:55.366
...this bullet
found at the scene.

13:55.401 --> 13:59.703
A bullet that matches
a standard-issue NYPD

13:59.738 --> 14:00.738
nine-millimeter.

14:00.772 --> 14:02.906
And since it has blood on it,

14:02.940 --> 14:04.141
it also indicates

14:04.175 --> 14:05.808
that someone was shot
at the scene

14:05.843 --> 14:08.412
where you and your father
both say

14:08.446 --> 14:10.613
no one was present
for his arrest.

14:12.683 --> 14:15.752
Care to amend your statement,
Detective Chandler?

14:24.542 --> 14:26.190
Let's try this again,
Detective,

14:26.998 --> 14:28.389
for the record,

14:28.390 --> 14:32.325
tell me exactly what happened
after the car crash.

14:32.359 --> 14:35.061
I already told you
what happened, Agent Hendricks.

14:35.096 --> 14:37.998
Why are you making this
so difficult for yourself?

14:38.032 --> 14:40.667
I don't understand.
I don't expect you to.

14:40.701 --> 14:42.169
So you admit there's more
to the story.

14:42.203 --> 14:43.436
Don't put words in her mouth.

14:43.470 --> 14:45.104
I didn't! She just said...

14:45.138 --> 14:47.673
I said that I don't expect you
to understand--

14:47.707 --> 14:49.008
meaning how
difficult it was

14:49.042 --> 14:50.676
for me to arrest my father.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.345
The father who apparently
you are in collusion with!

14:53.379 --> 14:55.714
You're both trying to cover
for whoever got shot!

14:55.748 --> 14:57.283
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:57.317 --> 14:59.351
I don't believe you!
I don't care!

14:59.385 --> 15:01.752
Asked and answered-- she has
made her statement twice.

15:01.787 --> 15:03.021
Why are you harassing her?

15:03.055 --> 15:04.522
Because my job is to make sure

15:04.556 --> 15:05.857
that everybody is telling
the truth,

15:05.891 --> 15:06.925
and she is not!

15:06.959 --> 15:07.926
You don't know that.

15:09.728 --> 15:11.129
The hell I don't!

15:11.163 --> 15:14.432
Now, let's make
no mistake here, Detective,

15:14.466 --> 15:18.435
your once-stellar career
is on the line here.

15:18.469 --> 15:21.738
Now, I am going
to give you one more chance.

15:21.772 --> 15:23.907
Who else was there?

15:23.942 --> 15:25.843
Who are you protecting?

15:29.513 --> 15:31.081
Nobody.

15:34.484 --> 15:36.719
All right, then.

15:36.753 --> 15:40.823
I will need your firearm
and I will need your shield.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.124
That's an order, Detective.

15:53.502 --> 15:57.239
Have ballistics check this
for a match, top priority.

15:59.108 --> 16:00.775
You are suspended,

16:00.809 --> 16:02.310
pending results.

16:02.345 --> 16:04.045
Don't leave the city.

16:07.648 --> 16:09.149
Suspended? Great.

16:09.184 --> 16:12.086
So much for my moving on.
Now what am I gonna do?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.787
Look, you don't
have a choice.

16:13.821 --> 16:15.622
You gotta stick to your story.

16:15.656 --> 16:17.758
Yeah, sticking to my story
might save Vincent,

16:17.792 --> 16:20.494
but it doesn't help me.
That bullet is going to match.

16:20.528 --> 16:22.128
Your gun, yes; to a body, no.

16:22.162 --> 16:24.163
They're not gonna think
to try and match the blood

16:24.198 --> 16:25.831
to somebody who supposedly died
ten years ago.

16:25.866 --> 16:27.600
Okay, but how does that help me?

16:27.634 --> 16:30.003
They can't prosecute you
if they don't have a victim.

16:30.037 --> 16:32.338
But they're still gonna know
that I shot somebody.

16:32.373 --> 16:33.773
And even if I get off

16:33.807 --> 16:35.608
on a technicality,
they'll know I lied.

16:35.642 --> 16:37.109
I can't believe I'm still
protecting Vincent

16:37.143 --> 16:38.343
even after we've
broken up.

16:38.378 --> 16:39.677
Maybe you don't have to.

16:39.712 --> 16:41.446
I mean, if they
don't have the bullet...

16:41.480 --> 16:42.948
What are you
talking about?

16:42.982 --> 16:44.816
No. No. Whatever you're
thinking, forget it.

16:44.850 --> 16:46.952
I am not dragging you down
with me on this.

16:46.986 --> 16:48.153
I won't let you.

16:48.187 --> 16:49.521
You won't let me?

16:49.555 --> 16:50.889
Try and stop me.

16:50.924 --> 16:52.291
Look, Catherine,
I didn't just

16:52.325 --> 16:53.657
set out to
save Vincent.

16:53.691 --> 16:55.126
I set out to save you, too,

16:55.160 --> 16:56.394
and I obviously haven't done
that yet,

16:56.428 --> 16:57.561
and I'm going to

16:57.595 --> 16:59.130
whether you
like it or not.

16:59.164 --> 17:00.831
What do you get out of it?

17:00.865 --> 17:02.333
Redemption.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.801
Then...

17:04.836 --> 17:07.171
hopefully, drinks.

17:09.272 --> 17:12.075
Guess who just used their
one phone call to call me.

17:12.108 --> 17:14.644
JT just got busted
at Hudson Uni Hospital.

17:14.678 --> 17:16.479
What? Busted?

17:16.512 --> 17:18.815
Apparently, he was caught trying
to steal meds and blood.

17:18.848 --> 17:21.384
Obviously, Vincent's worse off
than he let on.

17:21.419 --> 17:23.086
Wait, where are you going?
To Vincent.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.253
I'm not gonna let him die
and be the one

17:25.288 --> 17:26.755
who killed him.

17:26.789 --> 17:28.991
Bail JT out,
find those meds.

17:34.597 --> 17:36.465
You're late.

17:42.972 --> 17:44.572
Sign both copies...

17:44.606 --> 17:47.508
and your father's secret
is safe with us.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.612
"Chelsea Curios"?

17:51.646 --> 17:52.913
Why? What is that?

17:52.948 --> 17:55.516
It's just antiques.
Now, sign.

17:55.550 --> 17:58.185
Antiques?

17:58.219 --> 18:01.088
Why would my father care
about antiques?

18:01.122 --> 18:02.856
Obviously, he didn't,
but unfortunately,

18:02.890 --> 18:05.459
he died before he could sell,
which leaves us with you.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.127
We won't ask again.

18:07.161 --> 18:09.196
Wait. Who are you,
and how do you know

18:09.230 --> 18:10.930
about my father?
Look, lady, you don't...

18:10.965 --> 18:13.399
You want everybody to know
about your father, is that it?

18:13.433 --> 18:15.901
You spoiled
little brat.

18:15.935 --> 18:17.269
Daddy can't protect you anymore

18:17.304 --> 18:18.971
from all of this
because he's dead.

18:19.006 --> 18:21.740
So, unless you want to
join his sorry ass...

18:29.748 --> 18:31.282
Ow!

18:31.317 --> 18:32.750
Too tight?
Yes!

18:32.784 --> 18:34.419
Too bad. Maybe next time
you'll think twice

18:34.453 --> 18:36.321
before trying
to steal meds.

18:36.355 --> 18:37.138
Sign right here.

18:37.163 --> 18:39.090
And I'll need the
evidence for booking.

18:39.091 --> 18:40.791
Blood, too?
If he tried to steal it.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.894
Gotta keep that refrigerated.

18:42.928 --> 18:44.629
All right. Thanks.

18:44.663 --> 18:45.762
What were you thinking?

18:45.796 --> 18:47.398
Are you trying
to lose your job?

18:47.432 --> 18:48.665
This from my fellow
body snatcher?

18:48.699 --> 18:50.401
No, I was trying
to save Vincent,

18:50.435 --> 18:52.069
apparently because
Cat shot him.

18:52.103 --> 18:54.304
He didn't give her
much of a choice.

18:54.339 --> 18:55.972
You don't know that.

18:56.007 --> 18:58.275
Yes, I do,
and so do you.

18:58.309 --> 18:59.743
He chose to go beast,
which means

18:59.777 --> 19:01.777
at least Cat knows
where to draw the line.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.113
How come you don't?
I'm not gonna let him bleed to death.

19:04.148 --> 19:05.448
That's not what I mean.

19:05.482 --> 19:06.982
You know, loyalty
to a friend is one thing,

19:07.017 --> 19:08.584
but here you are
yet again paying

19:08.618 --> 19:10.853
the price for Vincent.
You'd do the same for Cat.

19:10.887 --> 19:12.788
No, but I wouldn't put my life
on hold for her

19:12.822 --> 19:14.123
and go in hiding for ten years

19:14.158 --> 19:15.491
like you've done.

19:15.526 --> 19:17.426
That's more
than loyalty.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.261
That's something else.

19:32.241 --> 19:34.208
Uh, JT's not here.

19:34.242 --> 19:35.609
I know. He's in jail.

19:37.212 --> 19:38.479
He got caught trying
to steal blood

19:38.513 --> 19:39.547
from the hospital.

19:39.581 --> 19:41.648
Okay, you gotta get him out.

19:41.683 --> 19:43.951
We are. We're all covering
for you, Vincent.

19:43.985 --> 19:46.153
The question is, what are you
doing to help yourself?

19:46.188 --> 19:47.955
I thought we had
this conversation.

19:47.989 --> 19:49.855
I'm not your problem anymore.

19:49.890 --> 19:51.791
Just because you did
what you did

19:51.825 --> 19:54.294
doesn't mean that I don't care
about you anymore.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.929
That doesn't just go away.
It may never.

19:59.166 --> 20:02.034
Okay, I know that you don't want
to go to the hospital.

20:02.069 --> 20:04.571
All right, forget it.
Why?

20:04.605 --> 20:07.739
Why? You should know.
Especially you, of all people.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.709
Okay, but they're not gonna
test your blood for DNA.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.244
Nobody needs to know
that you're a beast.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.812
No, they'll run my prints
and they'll

20:13.846 --> 20:15.481
find out I'm Vincent Keller.
So?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.649
So I don't even know
who that is anymore.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.054
Catherine,
there's been a target

20:24.089 --> 20:25.590
on my back
for years, okay?

20:25.624 --> 20:27.158
You expect me
to just shine

20:27.192 --> 20:29.059
a light on it
all of the sudden?

20:29.094 --> 20:31.329
Let the whole world
take shot at me? No, thanks.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.930
Muirfield's gone.
My father is in prison.

20:32.964 --> 20:34.599
There is no one
after you anymore.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.001
You don't know that.
You're right, I don't.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.836
But would you rather die here
or take a risk out there?

20:39.870 --> 20:42.038
It's a risk either way,
all right?

20:42.072 --> 20:45.041
Not for you, maybe, not anymore,
but for me it is.

20:45.075 --> 20:47.710
I am the one who suffers
the consequences

20:47.745 --> 20:49.646
when this whole thing
blows up in my face.

20:51.215 --> 20:53.382
So that's it,
you just let yourself die?

20:53.416 --> 20:55.083
Everything I've
done for you,

20:55.118 --> 20:57.453
everything we've done
for each other just ends?

20:57.487 --> 20:59.888
What did we do all that for?

20:59.922 --> 21:01.190
No future?

21:03.059 --> 21:06.428
You can't use fear
as an excuse to risk your life.

21:06.463 --> 21:09.764
And since I can't keep helping
to save you,

21:09.798 --> 21:11.732
you need
to start saving yourself.

21:15.237 --> 21:17.237
Somebody else knows
about beasts.

21:23.674 --> 21:25.074
Why did you go there
to meet them?

21:25.114 --> 21:27.748
They were threatening to expose
what my father really was,

21:27.783 --> 21:30.385
and probably us, too.
I-I wasn't sure.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.986
You should've told me.

21:32.021 --> 21:33.421
You needed to rest.

21:33.455 --> 21:35.056
And I thought I could
handle it myself.

21:35.090 --> 21:36.624
By beasting out on them?

21:36.658 --> 21:38.793
They would've shot me.

21:38.827 --> 21:40.894
And I'm not sure
what they saw,

21:40.929 --> 21:42.229
but if they knew
about my father,

21:42.263 --> 21:43.596
they already know
about beasts anyway.

21:43.631 --> 21:45.865
So there are still people
after us.

21:47.327 --> 21:48.560
No, you mean me.

21:48.595 --> 21:49.794
Why?

21:49.829 --> 21:51.230
To get an
antique store?

21:52.599 --> 21:54.266
Where do you think
you're going?

21:54.300 --> 21:56.567
To the store, to try and
figure out what they're after

21:56.602 --> 21:58.569
so I can get it
before they do.

21:58.604 --> 22:00.070
You've gotta
be kidding.

22:00.105 --> 22:01.905
Vincent, you're in no condition
to go anywhere.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.709
And you're in no condition
to do this on your own, okay?

22:04.743 --> 22:06.143
You're new at this, I'm not.

22:06.177 --> 22:08.779
Okay, wait-- so you refuse
to go the hospital,

22:08.813 --> 22:11.282
but at the first sign of beasts,
you're up and at 'em?

22:11.316 --> 22:13.750
I can't just let them go
after her again, can I?

22:13.784 --> 22:15.619
I thought you were afraid
of being exposed.

22:15.653 --> 22:17.554
I am.
And you don't think that running around

22:17.588 --> 22:18.788
dripping blood
all over this town

22:18.822 --> 22:20.423
isn't gonna do exactly that?

22:20.458 --> 22:21.958
Catherine, I'm not your
problem anymore, okay?

22:21.992 --> 22:23.560
My life, my fight.

22:24.862 --> 22:26.663
Okay, fine, have it your way.

22:26.697 --> 22:27.930
I'll just check with Tess,

22:27.965 --> 22:29.498
see where they're at
with the meds.

22:29.532 --> 22:30.599
Good.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.604
Tori, can you move
to your left?

22:39.108 --> 22:40.576
You shot me?

22:41.878 --> 22:43.646
Again.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.680
You didn't give me
a choice... again.

22:45.714 --> 22:46.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:46.715 --> 22:47.915
Easy, easy, easy.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.285
Whoa! What'd you
do that for?

22:50.319 --> 22:51.839
I'm just trying
to save his thick skull

22:51.853 --> 22:53.120
until JT can get here.

22:53.155 --> 22:54.756
Besides, it's the
only way to keep him

22:54.790 --> 22:56.357
from not coming with us.
Us? Oh, now you're going?

22:56.392 --> 22:58.426
He can't help.
It's the only way for me

22:58.460 --> 22:59.860
to figure out
what's really going on

22:59.895 --> 23:01.127
so that I can move on.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.062
Are you coming?

23:11.806 --> 23:13.907
Open on two!

23:24.884 --> 23:26.852
Not who you were
expecting?

23:26.886 --> 23:28.887
I was hoping for my daughter.

23:28.922 --> 23:30.690
After everything you've done
to Catherine? Dream on.

23:30.724 --> 23:34.726
I saved her, Lowan,
from... things like you.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.128
That's all
I care about.

23:37.162 --> 23:38.863
Okay.

23:38.897 --> 23:41.232
One, I'm not one of those

23:41.266 --> 23:44.001
things anymore, so don't
lump me in with that.

23:44.495 --> 23:46.362
And two, you haven't saved her
from anything yet.

23:46.397 --> 23:48.331
That's why I'm here.

23:48.365 --> 23:49.832
What are you talking about?

23:49.866 --> 23:51.433
You know an Agent Hendricks?

23:56.406 --> 23:57.940
He's Internal Affairs.

24:01.477 --> 24:03.478
I confessed to everything.

24:03.513 --> 24:05.713
They've got nothing
on Catherine.

24:05.747 --> 24:07.115
He has a bullet

24:07.149 --> 24:09.951
fired from her gun
and at you-know-who.

24:09.985 --> 24:11.219
Exactly.

24:11.253 --> 24:12.520
Which means what
at first seemed

24:12.554 --> 24:13.855
like an
open-and-shut case

24:13.889 --> 24:16.291
is now looking more
and more like a cover-up

24:16.325 --> 24:18.459
with your daughter
and her entire career

24:18.493 --> 24:19.727
in the middle of it.

24:19.761 --> 24:21.995
All I care about is Catherine,

24:22.030 --> 24:23.630
just like you.

24:23.664 --> 24:27.734
And I will do anything
to help her, just like you.

24:27.768 --> 24:30.503
An ex-beast liking
my daughter is better

24:30.538 --> 24:32.206
than a real one, I guess.

24:34.843 --> 24:36.643
How can I help?

24:42.883 --> 24:43.950
Vincent?

24:45.252 --> 24:46.685
He's on the couch.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.957
Oh, my God, no, no, no, no!

24:52.692 --> 24:54.092
How bad is it?

24:54.126 --> 24:55.593
Bad. Very bad.

24:55.627 --> 24:57.329
No pulse?

24:57.363 --> 24:59.097
No, his pulse is fine,

24:59.131 --> 25:01.066
but someone
tranqed him.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.567
Who would do that?

25:02.601 --> 25:04.202
You know damn well
that if Cat tranqed him,

25:04.237 --> 25:05.370
she had good reason.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.105
Yeah, slows down
his vitals.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.373
That's a good thing.

25:08.407 --> 25:09.773
Any other reason come to mind?

25:09.807 --> 25:11.242
Other than the fact
that she seems

25:11.276 --> 25:12.676
to like shooting him lately?

25:12.710 --> 25:14.511
JT, stop being nuts
and just do your thing.

25:14.545 --> 25:15.779
Get him what he needs.

25:15.813 --> 25:17.181
Unbelievable.
I can't believe

25:17.215 --> 25:18.682
how everything's falling apart.

25:18.716 --> 25:19.917
You know what
you're doing, right?

25:19.951 --> 25:20.991
Yes, I know
what I'm doing.

25:22.653 --> 25:24.621
Here, fill this syringe--

25:24.655 --> 25:26.289
a thousand milligrams
of ampicillin.

25:26.323 --> 25:28.324
Okay?

25:30.494 --> 25:32.461
Hold on, buddy.

25:32.496 --> 25:34.364
Relax, okay?
You're doing great.

25:34.398 --> 25:37.400
Relax? Tess, he could die.
You said he has a pulse.

25:37.434 --> 25:40.236
He may be bleeding out.
But you brought blood.

25:40.271 --> 25:42.151
But it may not be enough,
and it's all my fault!

25:43.639 --> 25:44.907
I mean...

25:44.941 --> 25:46.574
What do you mean, it's your...?

25:46.609 --> 25:48.043
How is this your fault?

25:48.077 --> 25:49.978
Never mind.

25:50.013 --> 25:52.381
What?! JT...

25:54.784 --> 25:56.151
All right, you
want to know?

25:56.185 --> 25:57.919
It's because, if
it wasn't for me,

25:57.953 --> 26:00.221
Vincent would have never even
become a damn beast, okay?

26:00.255 --> 26:01.522
You happy?

26:04.259 --> 26:07.228
Muirfield didn't...

26:07.262 --> 26:10.798
choose him randomly.

26:10.832 --> 26:13.366
I put his name on the list.

26:15.702 --> 26:17.737
Yeah, me,

26:17.771 --> 26:19.139
his best friend.

26:21.342 --> 26:24.177
When he went off to Afghanistan,

26:24.211 --> 26:27.113
I was doing clinical trials,
and I came across a study

26:27.148 --> 26:29.514
the Army was working
on for soldiers.

26:29.549 --> 26:32.918
It sounded like a way
to give Vincent an edge,

26:32.953 --> 26:34.987
to keep him safe in battles,

26:35.021 --> 26:38.223
so I gave Muirfield his name.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.660
And they injected him.

26:46.698 --> 26:50.134
I should've checked them
out first, but I didn't.

26:50.169 --> 26:52.136
None of this
would've happened.

26:52.171 --> 26:54.172
That's why you put your life
on hold for him.

26:54.206 --> 26:55.373
You think you owe him.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.275
I do owe him.

26:57.309 --> 26:58.776
Well, in that case, you know,

26:58.810 --> 27:00.644
I think you should take
some responsibility

27:00.679 --> 27:02.645
for all the good
he's done since.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.215
You know, the bad guys
he's stopped, the beasts,

27:05.249 --> 27:08.151
the people he's saved,
including Cat.

27:08.186 --> 27:09.552
You can't beat yourself up

27:09.587 --> 27:11.955
without patting yourself
on the back, too.

27:35.177 --> 27:36.677
You're welcome.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.715
Where's Catherine and Tori?

27:46.854 --> 27:49.490
There doesn't seem to be
much here except dust.

27:49.524 --> 27:52.059
Doesn't seem like the place
has been open in a while.

27:52.093 --> 27:54.061
Then why'd they
want it so badly?

27:54.095 --> 27:55.729
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

27:55.763 --> 27:57.596
You sure they know about beasts?

27:57.631 --> 27:59.032
Well, I didn't exactly say
they did,

27:59.066 --> 28:00.900
but they certainly
implied it, strongly.

28:00.934 --> 28:02.502
But they saw you beast out.

28:02.536 --> 28:04.170
I don't know.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.006
I mean, if not,
they at least saw what I... did.

28:07.041 --> 28:08.741
So you're not sure?

28:08.775 --> 28:10.776
Tori, if they don't know
you're a beast and they

28:10.810 --> 28:11.911
don't know about beasts,
then maybe this

28:11.945 --> 28:13.012
has nothing to do with beasts.

28:13.046 --> 28:14.879
You know, you all but spit

28:14.914 --> 28:16.681
every time you say that word.

28:16.715 --> 28:18.450
What word? "Beasts"?

28:18.484 --> 28:20.285
Got issues?

28:20.319 --> 28:21.719
Just keep looking.

28:21.754 --> 28:23.455
For what?
I don't know.

28:23.489 --> 28:25.209
Something that doesn't
look valuable but is.

28:25.224 --> 28:26.591
You know, just
for the record,

28:26.625 --> 28:27.892
I didn't ask for your help.

28:27.927 --> 28:29.226
I'm not helping you.

28:29.261 --> 28:30.861
I'm helping Vincent.

28:30.895 --> 28:33.364
Why, 'cause you feel badly
for shooting at him?

28:33.398 --> 28:35.199
You want to do this now?
Really?

28:35.233 --> 28:37.068
Seriously, why are you
still helping him?

28:37.102 --> 28:39.570
I mean, you shot him,
which punctuates a breakup

28:39.604 --> 28:41.138
like nothing else can,

28:41.173 --> 28:44.241
and now you're here
helping him again. Why?

28:44.276 --> 28:46.443
I don't know, okay?

28:46.477 --> 28:49.946
Maybe it's habit,
or-or guilt.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.249
But what I do know is...
the sooner I don't have

28:53.284 --> 28:56.652
to spend any more of my life
dealing with...

28:56.687 --> 28:57.954
beasts...

28:59.090 --> 29:00.423
What is it?

29:00.458 --> 29:01.756
I'm not sure.

29:01.791 --> 29:03.092
Alarm?

29:03.126 --> 29:04.460
No, it's something else.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.528
I think
I might know.

29:07.697 --> 29:09.631
And if I'm right,

29:09.665 --> 29:10.865
then you, we'll need alive.

29:12.135 --> 29:14.769
But you, we won't.

29:17.812 --> 29:19.628
For the record, I'm a cop.

29:19.653 --> 29:21.332
A detective, actually.

29:21.507 --> 29:23.041
Where's your shield?

29:24.176 --> 29:25.743
I left it at home.

29:25.777 --> 29:26.811
Hmm.
And your gun?

29:31.850 --> 29:36.554
If she so much as flinches
or glows, shoot.

29:36.588 --> 29:38.423
I told you they knew about me.

29:38.457 --> 29:39.889
We knew about
your father.

29:39.924 --> 29:42.359
We didn't know about you
until this afternoon.

29:42.393 --> 29:44.394
So what do you want?

29:44.429 --> 29:45.669
To find out what her father
is hiding in here.

29:45.694 --> 29:47.097
Which is what?

29:47.098 --> 29:48.832
That's what we were
hired to find out.

29:48.866 --> 29:50.033
By who?

29:50.068 --> 29:51.301
"By whom."

29:52.803 --> 29:54.071
That's a retinal scanner.

29:54.105 --> 29:55.504
I'm assuming
your father programmed it

29:55.538 --> 29:57.239
to work on him,
but I'm thinking

29:57.274 --> 29:58.707
a genetic match
will work, too.

29:58.741 --> 30:00.042
So...

30:00.077 --> 30:01.577
look into it.

30:01.611 --> 30:04.413
Won't work if you kill me.

30:04.448 --> 30:06.048
True.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.817
But what if I kill her?

31:07.940 --> 31:09.541
