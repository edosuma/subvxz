01:26.417 --> 01:27.417
Quickly!

01:28.583 --> 01:29.542
Quickly!

01:33.958 --> 01:35.500
Take only what you need.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.333
Nothing heavy.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.500
Mama!
I looked by the river, by the road...

01:47.375 --> 01:48.458
In the field?

02:19.250 --> 02:20.625
We have to hurry!

02:20.708 --> 02:25.417
We just heard
the trucks crossed the river.

02:25.542 --> 02:27.083
We have to go now!

02:27.167 --> 02:28.042
Come on!

02:30.792 --> 02:34.292
I can't leave
without him! Please!

02:34.375 --> 02:35.417
Tespha!

02:35.500 --> 02:36.792
Tespha!

10:37.042 --> 10:39.042
Are we in Jerusalem yet?

10:43.208 --> 10:44.167
Not yet.

45:51.083 --> 45:54.875
I don't know
what you're looking for...

45:55.542 --> 45:58.333
but I don't think you're there.

45:58.458 --> 46:02.000
Isn't this
the Red Sea Diving Resort?

47:34.750 --> 47:37.167
Passports, please.

47:44.583 --> 47:47.667
I'll just make a photocopy
of these...

47:48.292 --> 47:51.083
And I'll be back with the keys.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.833
No matter what happens,
no matter what you see...

50:48.167 --> 50:49.917
No matter what you hear...

50:50.458 --> 50:51.625
Keep quiet.

1:00:38.042 --> 1:00:39.917
It all happened so fast...

1:00:44.083 --> 1:00:47.833
You shot a full magazine, yes?

1:00:50.833 --> 1:00:53.208
Yes, I'm sure I hit them.

1:00:56.208 --> 1:00:58.958
The Hadandawa
kidnap our daughters,

1:00:59.042 --> 1:01:01.458
and take them to be sex slaves in Jedda.

1:01:02.625 --> 1:01:05.708
If you do not stop them,
there is no reason for you to exist.

1:01:11.208 --> 1:01:13.167
I don't think
these were Hadandawa.

1:01:17.458 --> 1:01:20.583
From where I was standing,
it looked like the driver...

1:01:21.333 --> 1:01:22.167
was white.

1:05:39.625 --> 1:05:41.333
You're sure
you hit the trucks?

1:05:43.500 --> 1:05:45.833
At least six times.
Definitely.

1:05:46.583 --> 1:05:47.625
At least. Maybe more.

1:05:49.042 --> 1:05:49.875
Definitely.

1:06:10.167 --> 1:06:11.458
Back to the truck.

1:11:11.125 --> 1:11:14.125
People have disappeared
from the camp.

1:11:15.625 --> 1:11:19.167
I want to know where they are going
and who is taking them.

1:11:51.292 --> 1:11:54.500
People have disappeared
from the camp.

1:11:56.125 --> 1:11:59.208
I want to know where they are going
and who is taking them.

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:08.875
Sir...

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:15.250
I know who you're looking for.

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:19.708
His name is Kabede.

1:36:39.917 --> 1:36:40.792
Soldier...

1:36:41.917 --> 1:36:42.875
Yes, sir.

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000
Stop the truck.
Check the back.

1:37:21.375 --> 1:37:22.625
It's empty, sir.

1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:24.500
No one is in there.

1:38:26.667 --> 1:38:27.917
What's good today?

1:38:30.625 --> 1:38:32.750
We have fresh sea bass
and crab.

1:38:34.708 --> 1:38:35.667
Look at me.

1:38:37.583 --> 1:38:39.833
Pretend we are
talking about the food.

1:38:41.458 --> 1:38:45.042
Do you ever see refugees, not guests,
brought into this hotel?

1:38:51.292 --> 1:38:54.458
The whites,
do they sometimes leave at night?

1:39:00.125 --> 1:39:02.792
Now and then,
not every night.

1:39:04.792 --> 1:39:06.375
And when do they come back?

1:39:07.792 --> 1:39:08.958
The next morning.

1:39:28.208 --> 1:39:30.500
If I find out that
you're helping the whites...

1:39:30.750 --> 1:39:32.458
do something illegal here...

1:39:33.708 --> 1:39:36.000
I will hang you and your family.

1:41:22.208 --> 1:41:23.458
Where are you from?

1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:32.583
<i>Muhammad Qol.</i>

1:47:00.292 --> 1:47:01.667
Call everyone!

1:47:02.792 --> 1:47:03.792
Everyone!

1:54:02.625 --> 1:54:05.500
That plane must not take off!
Whatever it takes!

1:54:05.625 --> 1:54:07.583
Faster, faster, faster!
