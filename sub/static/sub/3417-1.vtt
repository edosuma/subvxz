This is a time of new beginnings,

00:31.766 --> 00:35.101

18:04.084 --> 18:06.317
Dude, I bet you could find,
like, clues and shit.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.453
What do you think you are?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.220
Sherlock Holmes?
What the fuck?

18:09.221 --> 18:10.556
Sherlock Homes!

18:10.557 --> 18:13.791
You're Sherlock Homes!

Here, let me try to open the door.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.499
HECTOR: Oh, it's sealed.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.334
JESSE: Hold it open.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.017
HECTOR: Probably
it's gonna be locked.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.973
See, what did I tell you?
It won't open.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.177
JESSE: I got an idea.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.581

Don't make noise!

Hand me the camera.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.423
HECTOR: Oh, it's fuckin' open, man.
Oh, shit.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.757
Give it to me, hurry up.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.825
Here, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.361
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.395
Turn on the light for me.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.197
All right.

Shut the fuck up!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.978
I know. My bad.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.357
Why would she lock her fridge?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.358
HECTOR: Fuck, what is this?
I don't know.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.592
For old people peeing?

19:20.593 --> 19:23.861
Hector, stop touching everything.
Hmm. It's garlic.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.837
(IMITATING PIG)
Stop touching everything.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.421
What is this thing?
Okay, don't listen.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.572
Hey, look.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.540
There's Chavo with a grenade
in his mouth.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.140
It's corn.

19:44.783 --> 19:45.983
Yo.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.321
I think that shit just moved.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.455
Go check it out.
No, man. You go.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.125
Just go check it out.
Dude, just fuck...

a shower either, fuck.

a baby?

You don't know the shit she...

21:40.966 --> 21:42.668
JESSE:
A bunch of old-school tapes.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.870
See this? Dude.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.505

check out that last room.

journal or something.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.648
What you guys doing here?

22:29.649 --> 22:33.666
You heard that he did this shit.
That wasn't my little brother.

22:33.692 --> 22:36.621
What about that bitch that used to
stay right here? You know about her?

22:36.622 --> 22:37.756
HECTOR: Honestly,
we don't know shit, man.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.057
JESSE: We don't
know anything.

guys stole this from her house.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.340
Look, she has
a whole bunch of pictures.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.202
MARISOL: What's that?

22:53.071 --> 22:55.105
This looks dope.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.638
HECTOR: What language is that?

22:56.664 --> 23:00.602
They're basically saying
that if you build this door,

23:01.012 --> 23:03.682
it's like, you could
travel through time.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.206
HECTOR: Man, if she could
travel through time,

23:05.232 --> 23:07.085
why the hell is she staying
in this shitty-ass apartment?

23:07.086 --> 23:09.154
I'd timeportal my ass to
the Bahamas or something.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.089
No, it says <i>destinos profanos.</i>

23:11.090 --> 23:13.792
Like, you could only go to
unholy places through this door.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.527
HECTOR: Unholy places.
Oh, shit.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.135
What's an unholy place?
How am I supposed to know?

23:18.161 --> 23:21.400
I'm trying to get up into Marisol's
friend Espi's unholy place.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.435
Oh, you're so nasty, man.
Dude, that's her cousin.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.569
Look at this.
Can I see it?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.442
MARISOL: Looks like some
medieval looking type of shit.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.843
What is that?

23:31.844 --> 23:35.647
It's a map.
Scavenger hunt.

23:35.648 --> 23:39.382
HECTOR: This is like what Ana was
painting on that naked chick.

23:39.551 --> 23:40.685
JESSE: That is.

23:40.686 --> 23:42.621
MARISOL: Oh, shit.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.022
Maybe this is the ritual
she was doing to her.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.257
<i>"Levantese, incubo.</i>

(SCOFFS)
HECTOR: What's the <i>incubo?</i>

23:53.433 --> 23:55.132
It's like a demon.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.600
A demon?
(GROWLS)

23:58.103 --> 24:00.683
HECTOR: Why couldn't we
just buy a black mirror?

24:01.473 --> 24:03.675
Where the hell can you
buy a black mirror at?

24:03.676 --> 24:05.444
That doesn't even make any sense.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.145
JESSE: That's my boy.
Man, shut up.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.580
It's supposed to be
like a doorway.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.714
Like a portal.

24:09.715 --> 24:10.849
Like a port?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.751
Yeah, to the spirit world.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.854
I better not fall off this shit.
The spirit world, what...

24:15.855 --> 24:17.822
Yeah.
How do you even know this shit?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.491
I looked it up, fool.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.092
Grandma said we shouldn't
be fucking with that shit.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.461
Don't even worry about that.
Oh, my gosh!

24:22.462 --> 24:23.862
Just let it go.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.764
We're just gonna fuck around
and then, you know...

24:25.765 --> 24:27.425
Nothing's gonna happen.

24:33.883 --> 24:35.841
Don't trip.
You tie your shoes?

24:35.842 --> 24:38.777
Why can't we just do this
at your apartment?

24:38.778 --> 24:41.480
If my <i>abuelita</i> saw this shit...

24:41.481 --> 24:43.815
She would flip out. You know
how superstitious she is.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.756
Here, go in fast, but be quiet.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.988

gonna catch us in here?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.530
Yeah, I'm sure. Go through
this door right here.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.126

24:55.127 --> 24:56.928

crazy in the dark.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.435
Okay, I'm gonna put this down.

25:04.970 --> 25:05.937

25:05.938 --> 25:07.604
No.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.273
I swear to God.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.877
You're tripping.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.413
So what are we supposed to do?

25:13.439 --> 25:16.648
Make a triangle. I'm gonna
make it right here.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.716
And then put a circle in the
middle and put the mirror...

25:25.290 --> 25:27.225
Damn, that looks good.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.406

It looks just like the drawing.

After we say the spell,

25:34.800 --> 25:37.536
then the portal's
supposed to open up.

I don't know.

25:38.804 --> 25:39.903

to come through?

25:40.238 --> 25:41.806
I don't know.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.309
Is it gonna be floating around and shit?
Yo, that's gonna be dope.

No.

I promise you there's
no point of, like, going on.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.381
Hector.

57:07.190 --> 57:09.124
(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

57:11.161 --> 57:12.701
I think they're gone.

57:12.896 --> 57:14.030
Yeah, okay.

57:14.031 --> 57:15.064
MARISOL: Let's go.

57:15.065 --> 57:16.433
Yeah, come on.

57:16.434 --> 57:17.815
Go ahead, Hector.

57:27.143 --> 57:28.803
JESSE: What do you see?

57:32.816 --> 57:34.396
She's still here?
Yeah.

57:38.221 --> 57:39.821
It's a lady.

57:40.056 --> 57:41.789
What?
It's a lady.

57:42.492 --> 57:43.626
It's a lady?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.767
What is she doing here?
I don't know.

57:52.235 --> 57:54.175
HECTOR: (WHISPERING) Oh, shit.

57:54.604 --> 57:56.105

57:57.908 --> 57:59.742
JESSE: You think she's gone?
HECTOR: I think she left.

57:59.743 --> 58:01.066
She's gone?
HECTOR: I think she left.

58:01.092 --> 58:03.132
You sure she's gone?
Yeah, she just closed the door.

58:11.621 --> 58:13.561
MARISOL: What did she look like?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.225
HECTOR: She was dressed in black,

58:15.226 --> 58:17.760
and she was like this
tall, just a white lady.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.861
Is this Ana with Mom?
JESSE: Yeah.

58:20.230 --> 58:22.065
Where did you get this?

58:22.066 --> 58:23.967
It doesn't matter.
I just wanna how Ana knew Mom.

58:23.968 --> 58:26.935
Check out the picture. Mom was
pregnant there, with me.

58:27.937 --> 58:29.973
I mean, I heard stuff from
people saying that, like,

58:29.974 --> 58:32.108
Ana, like, she was doing
all this weird witch stuff,

58:32.109 --> 58:34.210
like, rituals on
pregnant women and stuff.

58:34.211 --> 58:36.678
How did Mom die?
Having me, right?

58:37.580 --> 58:39.215
So what if Ana did
something to Mom?

58:39.216 --> 58:41.684
You're tripping, dude.
Are you serious right now?

58:41.685 --> 58:44.019
Do you hear yourself?
You're just rambling on.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.655
You don't sleep, you don't eat.

58:45.656 --> 58:47.524
I hear you get up at night.

58:47.525 --> 58:50.426
What are you talking about?
<i>Mijo,</i> I'm worried about you.

59:51.154 --> 59:54.555
JESSE: (CLEARING THROAT)
Yeah, Dad. I'm fine.

59:56.693 --> 59:58.714
What the hell is happening to me?

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:04.334
Arturo's a serious gangster.
What is he gonna do?

01:00:04.335 --> 01:00:06.636
HECTOR: He's gotta
know something.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.271
It's Oscar's brother.
MARISOL: Why is he taking so long?

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.212
HECTOR: Oh, shit, is that him?

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.943
He's calling us.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.078
Don't touch nothing when
you get in there, all right?

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.946
JESSE: Okay.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.748
Mom's having a hard time
dealing with all this shit.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:21.751
She doesn't want nobody
moving his stuff.

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:24.086
I noticed Oscar started acting
different about a month ago.

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.720
He got real quiet.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.323
Stayed in his room all night.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.628
Then he started even
acting crazy with my mom,

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.690
started breaking
shit in the house.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:36.431
Then I found this.
MARISOL: Oh, shit.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.202
HECTOR: Oh, fuck.
Can we take a look at this?

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.336
ARTURO: The last time
I seen my brother,

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:41.804
he said there was
others like him.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.340
He said they were all marked.

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:47.010
He said these witches were trying
to build an army or some shit.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.277
MARISOL: An army for what?

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.212
These are all in
different languages.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:51.347
ARTURO:
From all over the world.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.049
HECTOR: It's all little kids?

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.351
ARTURO: All little boys.
First-born boys.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.120
JESSE: Like you.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:59.288
ARTURO: I'm the first-born.
JESSE: That's why...

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.723
But Oscar was adopted.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.228
So what happened with his mom?

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.164
She died at birth.
My mom and dad took him.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.932
HECTOR: That's like
your mom, Jesse.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.100
Your mom?

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.136
Yeah... (STUTTERS)

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.303
His mom died
while she was giving...

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:15.937
Who's this girl?

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:18.841
All these are boys,
and then there's this...

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.243
Isn't Carlsbad near here?

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.010
HECTOR:
Yes, it's pretty close.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.047
"Ali Rey was..."

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.848
Wait, that's her!
HECTOR: What is?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.216
That's her. It's Ali Rey.

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.550
It says "Ali Rey" in the article.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.154
Was he talking to her?

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:32.922
Do you know her?
ARTURO: I have no idea.

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:35.958
Thanks. We appreciate it, man.
We got to go.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.393
HECTOR: What are you doing?
We should check this stuff out, man.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:40.061
Come on. Let's just go.
Thanks.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.198
MARISOL: Jesse, what's wrong?
HECTOR: Jesse...

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.480
ARTURO:
What's up with your boy, man?

01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:46.459
No, he's just going
through a lot right now.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.641
JESSE: Yo! Let's roll.
HECTOR: Yeah. Sure.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.181
HECTOR: So what's up, dude?
What's wrong with you?

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.017
Nothing, man.

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:03.919
What do you mean, nothing?
Why'd you take off like that?

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.123
I said, nothing, man.
I'm fine.

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:09.104
Was it the thing about the mom?

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.930
Dude, Jesse, all that shit's exactly
what's been happening to you.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:14.897
All that stuff that
Oscar was saying.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.199
No, it's not.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.867
Then how do you explain
all the crazy shit

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.067
that's been happening?
Just back up, Hector.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.903
Please.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.972
No shit, man. You're the one
who told us to go to Arturo's.

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:25.073
You don't want to
talk about it now?

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.443
What's wrong?

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.946
Jesse.

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.248
Dude, Jesse.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.989
Is this guy bothering you?

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.618
What? No. This is Pablo.

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.221
Oh, is this your boyfriend?
He's a friend from high school.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.989
No.

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.592
Jesse, what's up?

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.197
Jesse, what's wrong with you?
Yeah, what's...

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:50.565
What's your problem, man?
HECTOR: Jesse.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.771
Jesse, calm down.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:57.033
Just chill out.
HECTOR: Dude, calm down.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.508
Did you not fucking hear me?
I said get out of here!

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:00.076
Dude, Jesse.
What the fuck, dude?

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.178
He's not doing anything to me.
Just calm down.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:05.014
What the fuck you looking at
me like that for, huh?
HECTOR: Jesse, dude... Hey!

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:05.882
Jesse, don't...
Dude, calm the fuck down.

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:06.951
Are you serious right now?

01:03:06.977 --> 01:03:09.252
Yeah, I'm serious. Do I look
like I'm fuckin' playing?

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:12.321
Jesse, dude, let's fucking go.
What are you doing, man?

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:16.225

Just leave him alone!

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.501
Get out of here, now!

here if you're gonna fucking hit me?

the fucking cops! Go!

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.260
Yeah, I'm getting the cops!

all morning, man. What's up?

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.437
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.104
Like last night.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.121
I couldn't control myself.

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.471
And a lot of times I feel like
I'm losing time. I can't...

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.582
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.549
All the stuff before, man...

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.989
It was fun, you know?

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.531
I felt like maybe I was
special or something.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:24.994
But not anymore.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.897
I'm telling you,
it's not gonna work again.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.864
You can just try it.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.634
Ask it something.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.536
It worked last time, right?
HECTOR: Yeah.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.437

it's gonna work twice?

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.920
I told you.

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:54.489

But why now?

was marked at birth,

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.744

and try to possess him?

Jesse, I'm assuming he's 18?
