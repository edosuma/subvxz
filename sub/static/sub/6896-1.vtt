WEBVTT

00:11.053 --> 00:13.680
Making for the freighter.
Keep the TIEs off our back.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.599
Split formation, Phoenix-2.
I'll cut across their axis.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.647
Good shot, Phoenix-1!
Save some for the rest of us.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.861
Phoenix-1 to Ghost,
we've cleared a path for you.

00:28.946 --> 00:32.156
Kinda nice having Phoenix Squadron
watching our backs.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.908
We always did all right on our own.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.495
True, but I prefer life
with our new fleet to flying solo.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.038
You were solo?

00:44.461 --> 00:47.213
I wouldn't mind getting my feet
back on solid ground for a while.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.091
Come on, Zeb.
Where's your sense of adventure?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.261
Phantom, I'm moving into position.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.973
Copy, Spectre-2. I'm on my mark.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.730
Firing now!

01:08.193 --> 01:10.069
Cargo is liberated.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.738
Spectre-2, you're clear for pickup.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.207
Imperial reinforcements have arrived!

01:24.251 --> 01:26.085
Karabast!

01:34.762 --> 01:36.679
Got real crowded all of a sudden.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.603
I need a little help. They're all over me!

01:43.687 --> 01:45.396
Got you covered, Phoenix-1.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.279
We're losing our deflector shields!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.490
Ghost, we must withdraw.

01:55.574 --> 01:59.160
Acknowledged, Commander Sato,
but first we're getting what we came for.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.168
Zeb, get ready to pull
those containers aboard.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.465
Almost in range.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.551
Anytime, Zeb.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.595
Come on. Come on.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.056
Ah, yes.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.476
Gotcha!

02:25.229 --> 02:27.855
Ghost to Phoenix Squadron,
mission accomplished.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.577
Spectre-5, bring it in.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.582
I'm in the pocket. Five by one.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.962
She's home.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.685
Agent Kallus,
I've exhausted every resource

03:05.769 --> 03:07.520
to find information about the rebels,

03:07.604 --> 03:09.522
but there is nothing to be found!

03:09.606 --> 03:11.858
What more
does Governor Tarkin expect?

03:12.150 --> 03:16.195
He expects Lothal to be punished,
Minister Tua.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.116
His own Star Destroyer
was demolished by these rebels.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.452
He takes that somewhat personally.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.415
Well, I've doubled patrols, set up
checkpoints, established curfews.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.376
I honestly don't know what else to do.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.045
Perhaps that is the problem.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.715
You lack imagination, Minister,

03:35.799 --> 03:38.759
when it comes to producing results.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.888
Lord Vader, with all due respect,

03:41.972 --> 03:45.558
you and Governor Tarkin
are asking for miracles.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.560
If the rebels have left Lothal, then...

03:47.644 --> 03:51.230
If the rebels have left,
then we must draw them back.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.442
And if they are here,
we must draw them out.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.611
We will squeeze Lothal

03:56.695 --> 04:01.407
until someone reveals
the whereabouts of these traitors.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.327
I'm sorry, my lord.
I am merely a public official.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.538
I have no experience
with such brutal tactics.

04:07.623 --> 04:11.208
You can explain that to Governor Tarkin

04:11.293 --> 04:13.127
when you visit him.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.422
Visit him?

04:16.506 --> 04:18.591
He expects you tomorrow,

04:18.675 --> 04:21.677
to account for your failure.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.512
But I'm needed here.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.723
I... I couldn't possibly get away!

04:26.808 --> 04:28.517
Not to worry, Minister.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.854
Lord Vader and I will manage
in your absence.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.533
You and your crew
have proven invaluable

04:44.618 --> 04:46.327
to our fleet, Captain Syndulla.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.955
The fuel acquired
in your convoy attacks

04:49.039 --> 04:52.249
has helped keep us
one step ahead of Imperial patrols.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.168
Thank you, Commander Sato.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.544
I'm just sorry our intel about

04:55.629 --> 04:58.172
shield generators
being on that shipment was wrong.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.924
Perhaps with your next attack, Hera.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.596
What is the meaning of this?

05:05.681 --> 05:08.015
An incoming transmission.
Who from, Chop?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.725
Why don't you just play it?

05:12.771 --> 05:15.898
Chop, cloak us with
a one-way transmission.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.277
Hey, it's Old Jho!

05:20.362 --> 05:23.739
I can't see you,
but I can hear you, my friends.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.575
Time is short,
and there's someone here

05:26.660 --> 05:28.244
desperate to speak with you.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.996
I told her I couldn't find you,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.081
but she wouldn't take no for an answer.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.750
She says she needs your help.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.961
We're always ready
to help someone in need.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.756
Yeah, well, this one's different.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.426
Minister Tua?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.846
We can't trust her. She's an Imperial.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.515
Please, I beg you. Listen to my request.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.267
End transmission now, Chop.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.310
Wait! Minister, what do you want?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.146
My life is in danger.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.107
I need you to give me
safe passage off Lothal.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.109
-You're not really considering this?
-Quiet!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.361
I assure you, my intentions are sincere.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.447
To prove it, I will trade

06:04.531 --> 06:06.699
secret Imperial information.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.286
You're defecting from the Empire?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.747
Yes, I am.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.666
She's telling the truth.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.877
I can sense her fear.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.712
Yeah, but of what?

06:23.133 --> 06:25.384
-So what have you got to trade?
-A list...

06:25.469 --> 06:28.220
Of rebel sympathizers on Lothal...

06:28.305 --> 06:30.222
And other nearby systems.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.768
How come these sympathizers
have not been arrested?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.103
Some have powerful friends
in the Senate.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.522
Imperial command watches them,
but can do nothing.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.067
I know you need allies.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.278
Get me off Lothal,
and I will give you the list.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.493
We shouldn't even consider this.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.078
It's obviously a trap.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.412
There's something else.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.081
I've discovered the true reason

06:55.165 --> 06:56.874
the Empire came to Lothal.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.334
We know that one.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.502
The Empire has a factory,

06:59.586 --> 07:02.129
and they're stripping
the planet's resources to fuel it.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.673
No. There is another reason

07:04.758 --> 07:06.926
known only to a few

07:07.010 --> 07:09.804
and ordered by the Emperor himself.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.773
We have to do this.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.734
-I agree.
-So do I.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.862
All right, if Commander Sato
approves the mission.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.324
I believe it could be worth the risk.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.284
Minister, we'll get you out.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.702
Send us your coordinates.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.287
Thank you.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.462
Well, I guess we're on
our way back to Lothal.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.214
I guess we are.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.012
Hey! What's with you?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.765
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate that was?

07:54.850 --> 07:56.767
Actually, no, I don't.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.479
You can't just tell Chopper
to project a hologram

08:00.564 --> 08:02.857
in a secret debriefing
without authorization.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.817
Authorization! Procedure!

08:04.901 --> 08:06.235
That's what's bothering me.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.279
All right, talk to me.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.240
After this mission,

08:11.324 --> 08:12.825
I want us to go back on our own.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.286
Fighting alongside soldiers
isn't what I signed up for.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.916
You seem to be forgetting
these soldiers helped save your life.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.960
And I'm grateful. But that doesn't mean

08:23.044 --> 08:24.628
I want to join their little army.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.838
When you and I started together,

08:25.922 --> 08:28.090
it was, "Rob from the Empire,
give to the needy."

08:28.175 --> 08:29.383
A noble cause.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.219
Now we're getting drawn into
some kind of military thing.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.470
I don't like it.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.306
We are fighting a bigger fight,

08:35.390 --> 08:36.891
but it's still the right fight.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.684
I survived one war.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.519
I'm not ready for another one.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.856
-I saw what it did.
-To the Jedi?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.483
To everyone.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.895
So, we're not taking the Ghost,

09:22.979 --> 09:24.563
and we're letting Chopper drive?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.065
After our stunt on Mustafar,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.567
there's a good chance
the Empire will be able to track it.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.319
Great mission so far.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.333
So what's the plan?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.126
Okay, so Minister Tua is scheduled

09:46.211 --> 09:47.962
to visit Governor Tarkin tomorrow.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.464
She leaves Lothal via shuttle at 1800.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.590
We wait at the hangar,

09:51.675 --> 09:53.634
steal the shuttle and take her to safety.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.594
Ezra, I hope you're sure about this.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.513
After all the trouble she's made for us,

09:57.597 --> 09:58.847
why should we help her?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.349
Because that's what we do.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.434
Help those who can't help themselves.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.521
Plus, her list will help us out.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.408
Shuttle 593,

10:17.492 --> 10:20.160
this is Lothal Control.
You are cleared to land.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.706
I didn't think I'd miss it, but I...

10:24.541 --> 10:26.083
What is it?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.085
Do you feel that?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.795
I... I feel so cold.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.323
I've never seen so many
Star Destroyers here.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.409
It's gotten worse.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.787
All right, Zeb, Chopper,
stay with the shuttle

11:03.872 --> 11:05.497
in case we need a quick exit.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.293
Tua's leaving from Bay 23. Let's go.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.478
We'll need a distraction.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.944
Well, I'm gonna go make a few friends.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.488
When Tua arrives, I'll keep 'em busy

11:37.572 --> 11:39.239
while you all drop into the hangar
from above.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.242
-Make a few friends?
-It'll be fun.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.578
-Fun?
-Don't worry, General Hera.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.288
Just be ready to move.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.544
Hey, didn't we meet in basic training?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.129
You look familiar.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.976
Kanan's gone bucket head.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.561
I don't believe it.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.231
I'm kinda jealous.
I only have the helmet.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.080
Here she comes.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.543
But she's got company.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.420
What kind of company?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.009
Fantastic. Agent Kallus.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.309
Thank you, Agent Kallus, but there...

12:49.394 --> 12:51.603
There was no need for an escort.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.939
Lord Vader asked me to make sure

12:54.023 --> 12:55.649
you reached your shuttle safely.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.026
I see.

12:59.237 --> 13:02.197
We can't be too careful
about security these days.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.789
Yes, I suppose so.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.374
Hey!

13:15.170 --> 13:16.879
Minister, take cover!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.800
Surprise.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.051
Rebels!

13:35.231 --> 13:36.773
Minister, get to the shuttle!

13:36.858 --> 13:38.567
-We'll be right behind you.
-Right.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.671
Minister Tua.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.423
You did this!

14:07.514 --> 14:09.181
Zeb, we need a pickup. Now!

14:09.265 --> 14:10.432
Copy. We're on our way.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.111
Come on!

15:00.692 --> 15:02.734
Come on. Come on! Up, everybody!

15:02.819 --> 15:03.944
We're moving!

15:21.296 --> 15:25.090
Everything has happened
as you predicted, Lord Vader.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.301
Now inform the populace

15:27.385 --> 15:30.554
the rebel assassins hide in their midst.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.015
Lock down the spaceport

15:33.099 --> 15:34.349
and make it known

15:34.434 --> 15:38.312
any ship attempting to leave
will be destroyed.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.646
Right away.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.831
A beloved citizen of Lothal,

15:57.915 --> 15:59.666
Minister Tua's life was cut short

15:59.751 --> 16:01.585
by this criminal band of rebels.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.753
If you see them,

16:02.837 --> 16:05.047
summon Imperial authorities
immediately.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.716
Trooper corps have been mobilized
in an extensive...

16:08.801 --> 16:11.136
They did this to turn Lothal against us.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.804
We can't do any more here.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.765
We have to leave, for good.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.309
We can't just run.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.102
The people have to know the truth.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.191
I don't think the Empire
is giving us much choice.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.406
What the...

16:35.662 --> 16:36.787
Open up in there!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.749
We're in trouble!

16:45.088 --> 16:46.755
They resealed the door.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.256
Blast it open.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.768
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

17:28.297 --> 17:31.299
If they know about this hideout,
they'll know about our others.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.635
There's no more hiding.
We need a ship.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.638
Maybe we can try
one of the local Imperial airfields.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.891
They're locked down.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.727
Besides, we'll never
get outside the capital.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.937
The Empire's looking everywhere
for us.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.772
Not everywhere.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.650
The Imperial Complex? Are you crazy?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.736
Does anyone ever say yes
to that question?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.237
He's right.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.072
Deploying troops to block every city exit

17:54.157 --> 17:55.574
has spread the garrison thin.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.952
It sounds crazy, but the area
with the least troops will be...

17:59.036 --> 18:00.871
Here, near the factories.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.248
There are landing platforms
outside these hangars.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.208
They're our best chance
if we're gonna find a shuttle.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.335
I'm already dressed for the part.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
I guess there is no going home.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.029
What's this?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.157
Power cells in need of recharging
for the rebel pursuit.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.536
Hold it right there, Cadet.
We have to check inside.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.079
I got this.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.959
No, you don't have to check inside.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.005
Did you just try to
give me an order, Cadet?

18:52.089 --> 18:55.759
No. He just said,
"You don't have to check inside."

18:57.386 --> 18:59.638
I don't have to check inside.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.224
Well, then, as you wish, Trooper.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.684
Cadet, let's move. Hurry it up!

19:08.397 --> 19:10.315
I wish that worked for me.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.317
I wish it worked on you.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.842
Zeb, will you be quiet?

19:38.553 --> 19:40.512
What? I need to breathe.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
Have you smelled me?

19:43.099 --> 19:45.183
Don't think it matters if you're noisy.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.394
There's nobody around.
This was a good plan.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.272
Of course it was a good plan.
We came up with it.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.398
This way.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.318
Somebody get Chopper.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.197
-You think we'll find them this time?
-We better.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.950
Found me.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.971
There's a shuttle.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.472
What'd I tell ya?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.141
You did good.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.274
Hera, over here.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.736
Shield generators.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.154
Military grade.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.909
Zeb, Ezra, grab all we can carry.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.785
These might help turn this day around.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.829
The fleet could sure use them.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.475
Do you feel that?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.227
The cold.
