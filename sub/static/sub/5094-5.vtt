WEBVTT

00:06.016 --> 00:08.352
So, next weekend,
I'm going to be in Baltimore

00:08.353 --> 00:09.619
for the DA's conference,

00:09.621 --> 00:11.821
which means Grandpa is going
to stay over,

00:11.823 --> 00:14.391
so be prepared
for Westerns,

00:14.393 --> 00:15.659
and try to act interested.

00:15.661 --> 00:17.928
And you are not listening to me.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.163
Look at how cute
that little girl is.

00:23.267 --> 00:25.468
Yeah, she's adorable.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.170
Hi.

00:29.508 --> 00:30.907
Dad's kind of a jerk.

00:30.909 --> 00:33.510
Unfortunately,
that is not a crime.

00:35.212 --> 00:37.647
Five minutes ago.

00:37.649 --> 00:39.549
What do you mean?

00:39.551 --> 00:42.252
Five minutes ago,
you were that age.

00:42.254 --> 00:43.820
Feels like a hundred years ago.

00:43.822 --> 00:47.123
Hmm. Just you wait,
young lady.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.159
I know. Pretty soon,
I'll be out of school,

00:49.161 --> 00:50.593
and I'll have a job like you,

00:50.595 --> 00:52.696
and then, I'll have
a bratty kid of my own.

00:52.698 --> 00:54.965
I am just saying
that it goes by fast,

00:54.967 --> 00:57.000
so you should enjoy this age.

00:57.002 --> 00:59.469
You know what I'd really enjoy?
Hmm?

00:59.471 --> 01:01.304
If you let me stay
by myself for once

01:01.306 --> 01:02.672
when you go away
for the weekend.

01:02.674 --> 01:05.408
Finish your breakfast.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.846
I don't care what
the United Nations says.

01:09.848 --> 01:12.082
That particular nation
owes my city

01:12.084 --> 01:14.884
over $2 million
of unpaid parking tickets.

01:14.886 --> 01:16.453
Yes, sir.
Dino.

01:16.455 --> 01:19.089
Figure out some kind of
insider insult in that

01:19.091 --> 01:21.124
culture and have it delivered
to their embassy,

01:21.126 --> 01:22.425
courtesy of this office.

01:22.427 --> 01:23.860
Bad idea, Frank.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.295
Then come up with a better one.

01:25.297 --> 01:26.896
I didn't expect
to see you this morning.

01:26.898 --> 01:28.264
You told me to deliver the news

01:28.266 --> 01:30.100
even if it's not something
you want to hear.

01:30.102 --> 01:31.868
Should Garrett be in on this?

01:31.870 --> 01:33.803
Yes.

01:35.606 --> 01:38.241
The department chaplain,
Father Markham,

01:38.243 --> 01:42.245
got picked up on a DWI
about an hour ago in the 8th.

01:42.247 --> 01:43.747
At 9:00 in the morning?

01:43.749 --> 01:45.315
It's 5:00 somewhere,
as they say.

01:45.317 --> 01:46.816
Where was he stopped?

01:46.818 --> 01:48.485
This time,
on the West Side Highway.

01:48.487 --> 01:51.087
This time?
Turns out,

01:51.089 --> 01:52.922
it's the fourth time
in two months, and this morning,

01:52.924 --> 01:55.058
he rear-ended another car.
The lady was fine.

01:55.060 --> 01:57.627
She, uh, refused
medical aid at the scene.

01:57.629 --> 01:59.629
The PC's office might want
to reach out to her,

01:59.631 --> 02:00.764
make sure she's doing okay.

02:00.766 --> 02:02.766
Let legal handle it.

02:02.768 --> 02:03.900
A goodwill gesture?

02:03.902 --> 02:05.435
Could look like a cover-up.

02:05.437 --> 02:06.803
Understood.

02:06.805 --> 02:08.038
Where is he being held?

02:08.039 --> 02:09.538
Actually, he's sleeping it off

02:09.541 --> 02:11.174
in the back room at McDerry's.

02:12.544 --> 02:14.544
I'm not sure
I heard you correctly.

02:14.546 --> 02:16.312
The officer who made
the initial stop realized

02:16.314 --> 02:17.514
he was our chaplain,

02:17.516 --> 02:20.016
and he was trying
to do the right thing by him.

02:20.018 --> 02:23.987
Which is why I never heard
about the other three DWIs.

02:23.989 --> 02:25.055
Each time he got popped,

02:25.057 --> 02:26.856
it went farther up
the chain of command,

02:26.858 --> 02:29.459
and now that we have an
accident report to fill out...

02:29.461 --> 02:31.127
It landed on your desk.

02:31.129 --> 02:33.029
And now, on yours.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:44.708 --> 02:46.142
How's everything
over here, Erin?

02:46.144 --> 02:47.944
Delicious, as always.

02:47.946 --> 02:49.679
I'll take this
when you're ready.

02:49.681 --> 02:51.648
Thanks.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.384
So, what's the rest
of your day like?

02:54.386 --> 02:58.621
Boring class, boring class,
fun lunch.

02:58.623 --> 03:00.790
Boring class, boring class,
boring class...

03:00.792 --> 03:03.259
Okay, can you please try
to make me feel like

03:03.261 --> 03:05.795
you are ready to apply
to college next year?

03:05.797 --> 03:07.430
What in the world?!

03:07.432 --> 03:09.933
What's wrong, Ruth?

03:09.935 --> 03:13.303
That little girl
who was just here?

03:13.305 --> 03:16.639
Why would she write that?

03:17.508 --> 03:19.008
Go see if she's still outside.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.678
We knew there was something
weird with them.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.682
Okay, um, did they
pay by credit card?

03:25.684 --> 03:26.916
No. Cash.

03:37.528 --> 03:41.064
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm an
assistant district attorney

03:41.066 --> 03:42.432
from Manhattan.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.501
I'm wondering if anyone knew
the man who was sitting here

03:44.503 --> 03:46.569
with a little girl, or
if you had gotten a good look

03:46.571 --> 03:47.737
at his face?

03:47.739 --> 03:48.872
Mom, they're gone.

Uncle Danny.

04:22.260 --> 04:22.910
Hey.
Hi.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.494
Your mom said something about
a little girl in trouble.

04:24.496 --> 04:25.729
What's going on?

04:25.731 --> 04:27.364
She was hear eating breakfast,
and she wrote this note. Look.

04:27.366 --> 04:29.933
Where did she go?
She left with her dad.

04:30.559 --> 04:31.792
How do you know it was her dad?

04:31.794 --> 04:33.276
Oh, God,
what if it wasn't her dad?

04:33.278 --> 04:35.078
What if he's just some creep
who kidnapped her?

04:35.080 --> 04:38.114
Relax. Maybe she's just
playing a prank. It happens.

04:38.116 --> 04:40.250
Did anyone touch this table
after they left?

04:40.252 --> 04:42.636
No. Mom asked the waitresses
to show her the security tape.

04:42.638 --> 04:44.304
Hey. Thanks for coming.

04:44.306 --> 04:46.740
You do know that I
have a day job, right?

04:46.742 --> 04:48.275
Yeah. Did she show you
the placemat?

04:48.277 --> 04:50.243
Yes.

04:50.245 --> 04:53.347
I also remember the time she got
lost for all of five minutes

04:53.349 --> 04:55.315
at the Thanksgiving Day parade,
and you still wanted Dad

04:55.317 --> 04:56.683
to call in the
aviation unit.

04:56.685 --> 04:59.686
Okay, I am not overreacting on this.
Uh-huh.

04:59.688 --> 05:01.271
Yeah, she's right.
There was something weird

05:01.273 --> 05:02.773
about the girl's dad. I knew
we should have said something.

05:02.775 --> 05:04.324
Yeah, and maybe you
should have done

05:04.326 --> 05:05.692
a stop-and-frisk
while you're at it.

05:05.694 --> 05:07.361
Video.
I'm joking.

05:07.363 --> 05:11.147
Okay, so, that camera
caught them

05:11.149 --> 05:12.482
on the way out.

05:12.484 --> 05:14.801
And, look, she looks about
eight years old to me.

05:14.803 --> 05:18.922
Uh-huh. Eight years old,
brown hair, red windbreaker.

05:18.924 --> 05:20.090
I can't make his face out.

05:20.092 --> 05:21.758
There's not much
to go on here, sis.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.176
'Cause his head's turned away.

05:25.346 --> 05:28.598
This is the camera
over the front door.

05:32.270 --> 05:33.670
We can only see the top
of his head.

05:33.672 --> 05:35.171
Very observant.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.275
- Okay, you see that?
Mm-hmm.

05:38.277 --> 05:40.027
He went
to hold her hand, and

05:40.029 --> 05:41.228
she wouldn't let him.

05:41.230 --> 05:42.479
Okay, I had an eight-year-old
who didn't want

05:42.481 --> 05:43.780
to hold my hand
in public, too, sis.

05:43.782 --> 05:45.148
Just watch.

05:47.852 --> 05:49.853
Okay, you see that?
You wouldn't do that.

05:49.855 --> 05:51.038
Okay. Fair enough.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.540
But I still can't tell
if this is a matter

05:53.542 --> 05:55.242
for children's services
or the police.

05:56.294 --> 05:59.246
Actually, hold that.
Hold that. Rewind.

06:03.835 --> 06:05.368
Freeze it right there.

06:07.055 --> 06:09.806
Those look like karate pants,
which would make that...

06:09.808 --> 06:11.341
a dojo patch.

06:11.343 --> 06:13.593
I'm gonna need the tape, all right?
Sure.

06:13.595 --> 06:14.928
So, you'll find her,
Uncle Danny?

06:14.930 --> 06:17.814
I'll find the karate school
and see if I can ID her.

06:17.816 --> 06:19.316
If there's something going on
with this girl,

06:19.318 --> 06:20.984
I will find out,
and I'll let you both know.

06:20.986 --> 06:22.218
Thank you.
Thanks, Uncle Danny.

06:22.220 --> 06:23.970
Okay.

06:23.972 --> 06:27.908
I'm gonna need a single egg, ham
and cheddar on a roll. To go.

06:34.449 --> 06:35.565
You're right, Detective.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.667
It is a dragon on the bottom
of the pants leg.

06:37.669 --> 06:39.786
Okay, I need to know
if those letters

06:39.788 --> 06:41.338
are the name
of a dojo.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.422
I'll see what I can do.
All right.

06:42.424 --> 06:44.424
You got an early start.

06:44.426 --> 06:46.176
Keep working on that,
all right?

06:46.178 --> 06:49.296
Yeah, I caught a case
on the way in. Well, sort of.

06:49.298 --> 06:50.881
Like we don't have enough
already?

06:50.883 --> 06:52.799
It's a favor for my sister.

06:52.801 --> 06:54.584
Her and my niece
were out to breakfast,

06:54.586 --> 06:56.419
and a little girl at the table
next to 'em left a note

06:56.421 --> 06:58.772
saying, "Help me," and then,
she kind of disappeared.

06:58.774 --> 07:00.590
Did you check
with missing persons?

07:00.592 --> 07:03.193
Yes, and an AMBER Alert.
Nothing on both counts.

07:03.195 --> 07:06.563
Come on, Reagan. You know that
until a ransom demand is made,

07:06.565 --> 07:07.731
it's not a kidnapping.

07:07.733 --> 07:08.865
I know, I know.

07:08.867 --> 07:10.117
We'll just give it
a little time.

07:10.119 --> 07:11.768
If nothing pops,
we'll turn it over to ACS,

07:11.770 --> 07:13.737
and we'll get back
to our own cases, all right?

07:13.739 --> 07:14.938
Detective?

07:14.940 --> 07:16.156
You were able
to enhance it?

07:16.158 --> 07:18.542
Enough to get the name of the school.
And?

07:18.544 --> 07:20.109
Gotham Karate Academy.

07:20.111 --> 07:21.745
Beautiful. Let's go.

07:21.747 --> 07:24.581
So, does this mean we can
catch cases from my family, too?

07:24.583 --> 07:25.749
'Cause, you know, my sister--

07:25.751 --> 07:27.200
she's been nagging me
to find her a boyfriend.

07:27.202 --> 07:28.635
That's funny.
Can I drive?

07:28.637 --> 07:30.954
That's <i>funnier.</i>

07:30.956 --> 07:33.757
<i>Their M.O. is pretty</i>
<i>straightforward, actually.</i>

07:33.759 --> 07:34.891
They, uh, come in as a couple,

07:34.893 --> 07:36.409
both wearing a hat
and sunglasses,

07:36.411 --> 07:39.128
ask to see the diamonds
in your highest range.

07:39.130 --> 07:41.014
He plays the bored husband,
says he'll wait outside.

07:41.016 --> 07:42.098
You buzz him out.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.650
He holds the door,
she whips out a hammer,

07:43.652 --> 07:46.135
smashes the case,
grabs everything she can.

07:46.137 --> 07:47.637
And then, off they go.

07:47.639 --> 07:48.905
Oh, my.

07:48.907 --> 07:51.024
It's not going to happen to you.

07:51.026 --> 07:53.476
We're gonna make sure
we stop it in its tracks.

07:53.478 --> 07:55.829
They look swarthy.

07:55.831 --> 07:56.947
Are they Middle Eastern?

07:56.949 --> 07:58.314
Uh, description
has them ID'd

07:58.316 --> 07:59.816
as Latino or Hispanic.

07:59.818 --> 08:01.785
Where do I come in?

08:01.787 --> 08:03.319
You're to handle
store business as usual.

08:03.321 --> 08:05.839
You're not to draw your weapon
under any circumstances.

08:05.841 --> 08:07.824
Oh.

08:07.826 --> 08:10.377
Okay.

08:10.379 --> 08:13.713
So, let's, uh, open up and hope
for an uneventful day.

08:17.553 --> 08:18.802
One.

08:18.804 --> 08:19.970
Two.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.490
One... two...

08:23.492 --> 08:25.058
Excuse me? Sansei?

08:25.060 --> 08:26.293
Little help here?

08:26.295 --> 08:28.295
Yeah, if you guys want
to enroll, just take a seat,

08:28.297 --> 08:29.429
I'll be with you in, like,

08:29.431 --> 08:30.831
ten minutes or so
when class is done.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.450
Not that kind of help.

08:33.452 --> 08:36.236
This little girl-- is she
a student here in your class?

08:36.238 --> 08:38.238
Yeah. Lottie Holden.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.523
Lottie Holden. What can
you tell us about her?

08:40.525 --> 08:43.293
I don't know.
She's a sweet girl.

08:43.294 --> 08:44.794
Hmm.
When was the last time you saw her?

08:44.796 --> 08:47.380
Two nights ago... in class.

08:47.382 --> 08:48.632
Look, is everything okay?

08:48.634 --> 08:51.084
Mm, the man in the
picture with her--

08:51.086 --> 08:52.552
is that her dad?

08:52.554 --> 08:54.004
Not the way I remember him.

08:54.006 --> 08:55.204
That guy looks
too tall.

08:55.206 --> 08:56.539
And her dad's
got curly hair.

08:56.541 --> 08:57.707
Her parents still together?

08:57.709 --> 09:00.209
Yeah. Yeah, Lottie talks
about them all the time.

09:00.211 --> 09:01.811
We need to contact them.

09:01.813 --> 09:03.379
All right, well,
they run a travel agency.

09:03.381 --> 09:05.232
13th and, um, Walter.

09:05.234 --> 09:07.234
Holden Euro Travel.

09:07.236 --> 09:09.185
- Thanks.
- One...

09:14.642 --> 09:16.743
And my wife-- you know,

09:16.745 --> 09:20.480
she has no interest in,
um, marital relations?

09:20.482 --> 09:23.900
So, I'm just tempted
as tempted could be

09:23.902 --> 09:25.535
with this, uh, coworker.

09:25.537 --> 09:28.038
You know, and why not?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.238
If your wife gave up beer,

09:29.240 --> 09:31.341
does that mean
you have to give up beer?

09:31.343 --> 09:33.343
Yeah, exactly.

09:33.345 --> 09:36.096
Pay the attention to your wife
that you're paying to this

09:36.098 --> 09:37.264
coworker.

09:37.266 --> 09:39.248
She may surprise you.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.552
Keep it in your pants
till she does.

09:42.554 --> 09:44.938
Uh, thank you, Father.

09:44.940 --> 09:47.440
Say three Hail Marys
for strength.

10:00.538 --> 10:03.323
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

10:03.325 --> 10:05.375
Frank?

10:05.377 --> 10:08.545
Actually, I had
a pretty good week.

10:10.081 --> 10:12.615
You sobered up?
Yes.

10:12.617 --> 10:14.551
Good.

10:14.553 --> 10:17.220
Get down to the 8th precinct
and turn yourself in.

10:17.222 --> 10:18.805
You'll be book, arraigned
and released

10:18.807 --> 10:20.390
on your own recognizance.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.761
Even priests do penance, Jerry.

10:31.352 --> 10:33.853
Please check again.

10:33.855 --> 10:36.139
I need to get them
through customs

10:36.141 --> 10:38.491
in Maribor.

10:38.493 --> 10:39.993
Mrs. Holden.

10:39.995 --> 10:43.113
Yes. Uh, where would you like
to vacation today?

10:43.115 --> 10:45.115
Um, Dubrovnik is lovely

10:45.117 --> 10:46.950
and a great deal
this time of year.

10:46.952 --> 10:49.035
We're not vacationing.
We're investigating.

10:49.037 --> 10:51.454
Detective Reagan
and Baez.

10:51.456 --> 10:52.839
You're police?

10:52.841 --> 10:54.624
Is your husband here,
Mrs. Holden?

10:54.626 --> 10:56.426
He really should be
in on this, too.

10:56.428 --> 11:00.830
Um, Scott went
to passport agency.

11:00.832 --> 11:03.166
Hmm. Um,

11:03.168 --> 11:06.169
well, we have a few questions
about your daughter, Lottie.

11:07.004 --> 11:08.188
Why?

11:08.190 --> 11:09.522
Is something wrong?

11:09.524 --> 11:11.558
Well, she left a note

11:11.560 --> 11:14.510
asking for help in a diner
in Midtown this morning.

11:14.512 --> 11:16.646
What?

11:17.514 --> 11:19.449
This man took her away.

11:20.284 --> 11:21.951
This is...

11:21.953 --> 11:23.903
this is my husband.

11:23.905 --> 11:25.455
Sure about that?

11:25.457 --> 11:27.123
Of course.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.459
I know my
own husband.

11:32.329 --> 11:35.331
He took Lottie for breakfast
this morning before work.

11:37.051 --> 11:38.201
Is that a crime?

11:38.203 --> 11:39.535
Nope.

11:39.537 --> 11:41.204
Why would she ask for help?

11:42.056 --> 11:46.092
Our daughter loves
to play jokes, so...

11:46.094 --> 11:48.395
Misunderstanding.

11:48.397 --> 11:51.481
Well, sorry
to waste your time then.

12:00.908 --> 12:02.742
Maybe you need
to get your eyes checked.

12:02.744 --> 12:04.994
That woman was lying her ass off.
I don't think she wanted

12:04.996 --> 12:07.831
to be seen talking to the cops.
Okay, what do we do?

12:07.833 --> 12:09.499
We'll talk to her husband.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.203
Hey, Scott, hey!

12:13.205 --> 12:14.204
Play along.

12:14.206 --> 12:15.538
Hey.
Good to see you.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.841
How's it going? Uh, have we met?
Great.

12:17.843 --> 12:19.542
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

12:19.544 --> 12:20.693
You play along, okay?

12:20.695 --> 12:22.178
Give us a smile.
There you g...

12:22.180 --> 12:23.546
Big smile.
There you go.

12:23.548 --> 12:24.914
What-what is this about?

12:24.916 --> 12:26.082
Your daughter Lottie.

12:26.084 --> 12:27.133
Which means you're gonna

12:27.135 --> 12:28.268
grab your wife,
you're gonna meet us

12:28.270 --> 12:30.086
at the diner around the corner
in 15 minutes,

12:30.088 --> 12:31.387
all right? We'll see you there.
Y... Well,

12:31.389 --> 12:32.856
we can't be seen talking
to the police.

12:32.858 --> 12:34.441
We're not the police. We're
just a couple of old friends

12:34.443 --> 12:36.659
from the past.
Get your wife. Hurry up.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.815
30 grand for a watch.

12:41.817 --> 12:44.818
Aren't I worth it, lamb chop?

12:44.820 --> 12:48.288
Maybe that replica...
No.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.577
Mr. Bayless.

12:54.579 --> 12:56.463
How have you been?

12:56.465 --> 12:57.914
I've been better.

12:57.916 --> 12:59.115
I-I'm sorry. What's-what's
your name again?

12:59.117 --> 13:00.250
Brian.

13:00.252 --> 13:01.450
Thanks for asking, Brian.

13:01.452 --> 13:03.386
Big day's coming up pretty soon,
isn't it?

13:03.388 --> 13:05.121
Big day?

13:05.123 --> 13:06.756
as supposed to be yesterday.

13:06.758 --> 13:08.341
Supposed to be...

13:08.343 --> 13:10.426
You postponed?

13:10.428 --> 13:12.645
My fiancée canceled the wedding.

13:12.647 --> 13:14.964
The day before yesterday.

13:14.966 --> 13:15.965
Oh, my.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.183
Yeah.

13:17.185 --> 13:19.419
Probably more information
than you wanted to know.

13:19.421 --> 13:22.272
I'm so sorry for your trouble.

13:22.274 --> 13:24.107
How can we be of assistance?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.449
I have the, uh...
the-the receipt.

13:33.451 --> 13:35.818
Let me just take a look.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.820
I mean, she-she hardly
even wore it. She, uh...

13:37.822 --> 13:40.507
she's a landscape designer,
and she didn't want to ruin it.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.342
Anyway,

13:42.344 --> 13:44.794
I'd just... like my money back.

13:44.796 --> 13:47.180
I'm sorry, Mr. Bayless,
but this is a custom piece.

13:47.182 --> 13:48.664
There are no refunds.

13:48.666 --> 13:51.500
It says here on the receipt.
I don't care what it says

13:51.502 --> 13:53.269
on the receipt!

13:53.271 --> 13:55.171
It's-it's an $8,000 ring

13:55.173 --> 13:57.307
that I never want to see again.

13:58.225 --> 14:00.310
Take it easy, bud.
These are...

14:00.312 --> 14:02.362
These are good people.
I'm sure we can help you out.

14:02.364 --> 14:04.447
Who are you?
I'm just a guy.

14:04.449 --> 14:06.032
This your girlfriend?

14:06.034 --> 14:07.784
Yeah.

14:07.786 --> 14:09.352
She looks nice.

14:09.354 --> 14:12.205
So you probably want
to stay away from me, pal.

14:12.207 --> 14:14.073
I might be contagious.

14:14.075 --> 14:14.908
With what?

14:14.910 --> 14:17.210
Bad luck. Look, I...

14:17.212 --> 14:19.295
I don't want to cause
any trouble here.

14:19.297 --> 14:22.749
I just want what I came in for,
which is the money...

14:22.751 --> 14:24.384
I can give you store credit.
That's the best...

14:24.386 --> 14:26.553
Why would I ever want
to buy something else...

14:26.578 --> 14:27.137
Sir!

14:27.138 --> 14:29.172
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

14:29.174 --> 14:31.891
What are you gonna do,
arrest me?

14:31.893 --> 14:33.309
Come on, sir.
Let's go.

14:33.311 --> 14:34.677
Get your hands off me.
Hey.

14:34.679 --> 14:36.429
Hey! Hey, guy!

14:36.431 --> 14:38.681
Hey!

14:38.683 --> 14:40.549
Whoa, whoa, hey.

14:40.551 --> 14:41.901
No-Nobody move.

14:41.903 --> 14:43.069
What'd you do that for, huh?

14:43.071 --> 14:45.021
I just want what's mine.

14:45.023 --> 14:46.489
Okay, well,
that gun's not yours,

14:46.491 --> 14:48.274
so why don't you just
put it down?

14:48.276 --> 14:49.725
Shut up!
My boyfriend's a lawyer.

14:49.727 --> 14:52.111
Listen to him
before this gets any worse.

14:52.113 --> 14:54.364
I'm done listening!

14:54.366 --> 14:57.617
I've listened to so much crap
over the last two days!

14:57.619 --> 15:00.169
Okay, look, nobody's gonna say
another word.

15:00.171 --> 15:02.538
All right?
You just put the gun down,

15:02.540 --> 15:04.073
and we'll all walk away.

15:04.075 --> 15:07.076
Nobody's going anywhere.

15:07.078 --> 15:09.262
Go to the back.

15:09.264 --> 15:11.130
Everyone. Move!

15:25.078 --> 15:26.878
Why don't you sit down.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.800
We know you're afraid.

15:31.802 --> 15:33.018
We're here to help.

15:33.020 --> 15:34.052
Brijita,

15:34.054 --> 15:35.771
we have to talk.

15:35.773 --> 15:38.140
And what if something
happens to her?

15:38.142 --> 15:39.975
We have to leave.

15:39.977 --> 15:42.110
Hey. Little girl's life
is in danger.

15:42.112 --> 15:44.279
Nobody leaves
until we get the truth.

15:44.281 --> 15:45.981
Talk to us, Mrs. Holden.

15:45.983 --> 15:47.866
What's going on
with your daughter?

15:50.236 --> 15:51.737
Lottie was kidnapped.

15:51.739 --> 15:53.705
It happened two days ago.

15:53.707 --> 15:55.707
I went to pick up Lottie
after karate class,

15:55.709 --> 15:56.908
and she wasn't there.

15:56.910 --> 15:58.410
And then-then he called.
He said he'd taken her,

15:58.412 --> 16:00.462
and we have 48 hours
to get him what he wants.

16:00.464 --> 16:01.997
And that if we even think
of going to police

16:01.999 --> 16:03.048
that he will know.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.750
What is he asking for? How much?

16:04.752 --> 16:05.801
He-he doesn't want money.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.703
He wants his people flown
from Zagreb.

16:07.705 --> 16:08.870
In Croatia?

16:08.872 --> 16:10.305
We specialize in travel there.

16:10.307 --> 16:11.490
I'm Croat.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.557
It's a growing market.

16:12.559 --> 16:13.959
He came in
a few days ago.

16:13.961 --> 16:15.361
He said his name
was Bodan Vidoslav,

16:15.362 --> 16:16.895
and he wanted
to buy tickets for two,

16:16.897 --> 16:19.598
uh, business associates
to fly here.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.066
That didn't strike you as odd?

16:21.068 --> 16:23.735
No, he seemed normal. I mean,
he filled out all the forms.

16:23.737 --> 16:26.805
I mean, we even have copies
of his driver's license.

16:26.807 --> 16:28.306
We're gonna need all of that.

16:28.308 --> 16:30.575
We started to arrange travel
and then I get a call

16:30.577 --> 16:32.110
from my friend
in Croatian consulate

16:32.112 --> 16:33.862
that the men he was trying
to bring here

16:33.864 --> 16:36.915
were flagged by Interpol
as Croatian mob.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.817
Hit men or something.

16:38.819 --> 16:41.036
They said his name
was fake, too.

16:41.038 --> 16:43.789
They told us to call him back,
say that there was a...

16:43.791 --> 16:46.324
a problem with his visas,
refund his money

16:46.326 --> 16:48.326
and just walk away
and let Interpol

16:48.328 --> 16:49.361
handle it.

16:49.363 --> 16:50.929
What happened
when you told him that?

16:50.931 --> 16:52.464
That's when he... lost it?

16:52.466 --> 16:54.382
No, no. He said, "Fine."

16:54.384 --> 16:58.103
He just walked away and, uh,
took his money and left.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.671
And then he took Lottie

16:59.673 --> 17:03.341
and said that if we didn't find
a way to bring them in here...

17:05.111 --> 17:07.679
...that he would kill her.

17:08.564 --> 17:10.181
When does the clock run out?

17:10.183 --> 17:12.284
He's going to call at 9:00

17:12.286 --> 17:15.203
to arrange the swap, but...

17:15.204 --> 17:17.038
his associates

17:17.040 --> 17:18.373
aren't on the plane.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.660
We couldn't make it happen.

17:21.662 --> 17:23.295
Please. Please.

17:23.297 --> 17:25.163
She's our baby.

17:25.165 --> 17:27.132
She's everything to us.

17:28.032 --> 17:29.718
We'll get her back to you,

17:29.720 --> 17:31.503
safe and sound.

17:34.223 --> 17:37.259
Reagan, tell me why we're not
just gonna shoot this guy.

17:37.261 --> 17:39.427
We draw, he fires--

17:39.429 --> 17:41.513
someone's gonna get killed.

17:42.682 --> 17:43.982
Hey.

17:44.734 --> 17:46.401
My name is Jamie,
and this is Eddie.

17:46.403 --> 17:48.770
And I'm screwed.
You don't have to tell me.

17:48.772 --> 17:49.821
No, you're not.

17:49.823 --> 17:51.690
What's your name?

17:51.692 --> 17:52.858
Grady.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.993
Grady. Okay.
I'm a criminal defense attorney.

17:54.995 --> 17:57.362
All right? Can we take
30 seconds to walk through

17:57.364 --> 17:58.446
where we are right now?

17:58.448 --> 17:59.664
Talk.

17:59.666 --> 18:00.699
Okay.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.417
Right now,
the only charges against you

18:02.419 --> 18:04.402
are menacing
and unlawful imprisonment,

18:04.404 --> 18:06.755
and that's only
if someone presses them.

18:06.757 --> 18:09.090
No one's gonna
press charges here.

18:09.092 --> 18:11.042
Okay?

18:11.044 --> 18:12.878
A-And I'll give
you a full refund.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.380
Cash?

18:13.387 --> 18:15.662
I don't have that kind
of cash in the store.

18:15.849 --> 18:17.299
You'll go back on it.

18:17.301 --> 18:19.134
Cancel the check.

18:19.136 --> 18:20.519
- Hey! Get up!
- Grady...

18:20.521 --> 18:22.053
Grady, I'm trying
to help you right now

18:22.055 --> 18:24.088
because you're not doing a very
good job of that yourself, okay?

18:24.090 --> 18:25.557
How long since you slept?

18:25.559 --> 18:27.058
Long.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.476
Go! Open the register!

18:28.478 --> 18:30.529
There's maybe $200
and change in there.

18:30.531 --> 18:32.364
And you touch a single dollar,
that makes this

18:32.366 --> 18:33.481
armed robbery,
which you didn't

18:33.483 --> 18:34.533
come here to do or you would've

18:34.535 --> 18:35.483
brought your own gun.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.986
I just came
to get my money back!

18:37.988 --> 18:39.821
Grady, what's her name?

18:39.823 --> 18:40.705
Who?

18:40.707 --> 18:42.207
The bitch.

18:42.209 --> 18:44.826
She's-she's not a bitch.

18:45.611 --> 18:47.829
Is she worth
losing your life over?

18:47.831 --> 18:50.081
Look, please,
I don't even know you, lady.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.616
No one is worth that.

18:54.887 --> 18:56.555
No one.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.793
Her name's Alyssa.

19:09.852 --> 19:11.686
Here's the text of the remarks

19:11.688 --> 19:13.822
you'll be giving to
the governor's council tomorrow.

19:13.824 --> 19:16.157
And I pushed the Battery Park
town hall

19:16.159 --> 19:18.026
till next week.
Thank you.

19:25.534 --> 19:26.818
There's more.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.037
I also went over
to the chaplain's office

19:29.039 --> 19:30.255
and did a little
asking around

19:30.257 --> 19:31.623
about Father Markham.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.091
And why would you do that?

19:33.093 --> 19:35.043
Because I know he's a friend
of yours, Frank,

19:35.045 --> 19:37.796
and you'd think it'd be
out of line to do it yourself.

19:42.001 --> 19:44.269
I see.

19:44.271 --> 19:47.055
Seems his... drinking

19:47.057 --> 19:49.524
started accelerating
about five months ago,

19:49.526 --> 19:51.860
around the time a cop
he'd been counseling

19:51.862 --> 19:53.028
took his own life.

19:53.030 --> 19:54.779
Some sergeant he'd been
in the trenches with

19:54.781 --> 19:57.983
during and after 9/11.

19:59.819 --> 20:01.703
Jimmy Luckland.

20:01.705 --> 20:03.121
How'd you know?

20:05.458 --> 20:08.793
I only heard he passed away.

20:08.795 --> 20:11.129
Luckland invested out
about four years ago

20:11.131 --> 20:14.198
and kind of fell
off the grid.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.585
Even stopped cashing his
pension checks, but apparently

20:17.587 --> 20:20.005
Father Markham stuck with him.

20:23.743 --> 20:25.894
Damn it.

20:32.184 --> 20:33.551
Not to sound harsh,

20:33.553 --> 20:37.022
but don't chaplains deal
with cops dying all the time?

20:43.195 --> 20:48.733
Jimmy Luckland wasn't just
another cop to Jerry Markham.

20:48.735 --> 20:52.287
Working the pile, me and Jimmy,
and a lot of other guys,

20:52.289 --> 20:56.675
took refuge
in St. Paul's Chapel.

20:56.677 --> 20:59.878
Slept in the pews.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.963
Father Markham was there, too?

21:03.099 --> 21:06.184
Feeding us, praying with us.

21:09.188 --> 21:10.805
Jimmy cracked up.

21:10.807 --> 21:13.525
Couldn't go in anymore.

21:13.527 --> 21:16.427
Jerry stayed by his side.

21:16.429 --> 21:19.698
Made him his right hand,
made sure he felt...

21:19.700 --> 21:22.867
that he still
belonged down there.

21:22.869 --> 21:24.986
Sir, Father Markham's
on the line,

21:24.988 --> 21:27.238
says he needs to come see you.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.357
Won't take long.

21:37.049 --> 21:39.000
I'm out.

21:43.806 --> 21:46.424
Yes, sir.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.795
He's gonna resign.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.019
And then on Monday,
we were gonna go to...

21:58.021 --> 22:00.238
Nigeria to work on a...

22:00.240 --> 22:03.024
a clean-water project

22:03.026 --> 22:05.193
for our honeymoon.
Hm.

22:05.195 --> 22:06.811
Yeah, we're weird like that.

22:06.813 --> 22:08.980
That's not weird,
that's doing something good.

22:08.982 --> 22:11.149
We're not a "we" anymore.

22:11.151 --> 22:14.252
Maybe she just...
got cold feet.

22:15.454 --> 22:18.540
No. She's in...
she's in love with another guy.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.542
She couldn't have been
nicer about it, but...

22:20.544 --> 22:22.177
and now I'm...

22:22.179 --> 22:23.762
going on this...

22:23.764 --> 22:26.347
trip to Africa...

22:27.716 --> 22:29.717
...all alone.

22:29.719 --> 22:32.837
And you just thought that
if you could get a refund...

22:32.839 --> 22:34.939
you could use the money there?

22:34.941 --> 22:38.476
D-Do you know how much
$8,000 can buy there?

22:38.478 --> 22:40.645
How much good it can do?

22:48.187 --> 22:50.572
You're not going
to Nigeria on Monday...

22:50.574 --> 22:52.657
Grady, but...
with a smart lawyer

22:52.659 --> 22:55.627
and the right ADA--
which I can help you with--

22:55.629 --> 22:57.295
you can get there real soon.

22:58.330 --> 23:01.549
But you've got
to end this, okay?

23:03.302 --> 23:05.003
Right now.

23:09.008 --> 23:10.708
Okay, you want a hostage?

23:10.710 --> 23:12.510
I'll stay.

23:13.229 --> 23:14.762
We'll stay here together

23:14.764 --> 23:16.848
and we'll work this out,
all right?

23:17.817 --> 23:20.768
But you got
to let these people go.

23:24.389 --> 23:25.940
That's the deal.

23:34.918 --> 23:36.251
Go.

23:36.253 --> 23:38.086
Go!

23:41.540 --> 23:43.508
Reagan, Reagan, I'm not
leaving you with him.

23:43.510 --> 23:45.126
Call for backup.
Reagan...

23:45.128 --> 23:47.345
Go before I change my mind!

23:50.800 --> 23:53.134
Police! Drop the gun!
What? Wait!

23:53.136 --> 23:54.853
I thought you said you were a lawyer!
Put it down!

23:54.855 --> 23:58.540
I'm also a New York City cop.
Put it on the ground right now!

24:01.394 --> 24:03.228
Sorry, Grady.
You're under arrest.

24:03.230 --> 24:06.030
You had me for a second.

24:06.032 --> 24:08.432
I thought you actually
gave a damn.

24:08.434 --> 24:10.268
I do--
otherwise you'd be dead.

24:28.274 --> 24:30.354
Hey. You got the ID
the kidnapper gave the Holdens?

24:30.650 --> 24:33.083
Yeah. Like Interpol said,
the name Vidoslav

24:33.084 --> 24:34.417
is fictitious.

24:34.419 --> 24:36.285
Yeah, his name
might be fictitious,

24:36.287 --> 24:38.287
but he can't fake
the ugly face.

24:38.289 --> 24:40.006
Which is why
I'm running it

24:40.008 --> 24:41.958
through facial recognition,
see if it matches up

24:41.960 --> 24:43.409
with any other hump.

24:45.412 --> 24:46.596
How they doing?

24:46.598 --> 24:48.747
About as well
as can be expected.

24:48.749 --> 24:50.216
A lot better
than I'd be doing

24:50.218 --> 24:52.351
if my kid was out there
with that maniac.

24:52.353 --> 24:53.703
Well, hopefully,
he's just some dummy.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.138
I mean, he did break the number-one
rule of kidnapping--

24:56.140 --> 24:58.524
don't take your victim
out for pancakes. - Yeah.

24:58.526 --> 25:02.928
I got a bad feeling that just
means he doesn't give a damn.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.598
Okay, here we go.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.534
Vigor Kovacs.
Okay.

25:08.536 --> 25:11.237
OCCB says he's a mid-level
Croatian gangster over here.

25:11.239 --> 25:12.530
Surprise, surprise.

25:12.555 --> 25:14.374
Well, if he's bringing
hit men to the U.S.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.433
he's not planning on becoming
a choirboy anytime soon.

25:16.458 --> 25:17.768
No.

25:20.297 --> 25:22.548
Mr. Holden said this guy Kovacs
didn't even know

25:22.550 --> 25:24.217
the associates
he was bringing over here.

25:24.219 --> 25:26.836
He said he had their information
on a piece of paper,

25:26.838 --> 25:29.839
like they, uh, like they were
recommended from somebody else.

25:29.841 --> 25:30.788
What are you thinking?

25:30.813 --> 25:33.310
I'm thinking maybe we
could surprise this guy Kovacs.

25:33.311 --> 25:36.145
I mean, if he doesn't know
the guys, he's never seen

25:36.147 --> 25:38.397
the guys, he doesn't know
what they look like.

25:38.399 --> 25:41.467
If we inserted two of our guys
to go make the switch...

25:41.469 --> 25:42.568
Well, we better make it quick--

25:42.570 --> 25:44.437
we only have a few hours left
until he calls.

25:44.439 --> 25:45.804
Let's make some calls
of our own.

25:55.832 --> 25:57.867
Erin. Hey, you
got a minute?

25:57.869 --> 25:59.035
Barely. What's up?

25:59.037 --> 26:00.486
I need your help.

26:00.488 --> 26:03.456
Made a collar earlier today,
kind of a complicated situation,

26:03.458 --> 26:04.644
and the prosecutor that I

26:04.669 --> 26:06.830
caught in ECAB will only see
things in black and white.

26:07.011 --> 26:10.263
Is he calling it a bad collar?
No, the opposite.

26:10.265 --> 26:12.048
I tried to tell him all
the mitigating factors,

26:12.050 --> 26:14.383
but he seemed determined to
just nail this guy to the wall.

26:14.385 --> 26:16.502
You know, criminal possession
of a weapon, robbery one,

26:16.504 --> 26:19.355
robbery three,
unlawful imprisonment.

26:19.357 --> 26:21.507
Was it a hostage situation?

26:21.509 --> 26:23.559
Yeah, and I was
one of them.

26:23.561 --> 26:26.696
Wait. What?
It's not as bad as it sounds.

26:26.698 --> 26:28.013
Nobody got hurt.

26:28.015 --> 26:29.482
The guy gave it up.

26:29.484 --> 26:31.517
And I looked up his sheet,

26:31.519 --> 26:34.370
and he's never had so much
as a speeding ticket before.

26:34.372 --> 26:36.656
What's your stake
in this, Jamie?

26:38.525 --> 26:40.159
He's just a regular guy
that snapped.

26:40.161 --> 26:41.661
I mean, throwing him
into the system

26:41.663 --> 26:43.329
is not an answer
unless the question is:

26:43.331 --> 26:45.581
What can we do to make
a bad situation worse?

26:45.583 --> 26:46.916
Okay, why did he snap?

26:46.918 --> 26:48.867
His fiancée dumped him
the day before the wedding.

26:48.869 --> 26:51.470
He went to return the ring,
but they wouldn't take it back.

26:51.472 --> 26:54.223
Okay, well, you know
I can't just waltz in there

26:54.225 --> 26:56.892
and override
another ADA's charges.

26:56.894 --> 26:59.011
But you can sweet-talk, though.

26:59.013 --> 27:02.231
Says the man who's
trying to sweet-talk me.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.402
What's his name?

27:06.404 --> 27:07.553
Grady Bayless.

27:07.555 --> 27:09.438
I will look into it.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.507
Thanks.

27:20.951 --> 27:22.368
S-So why hasn't
he called us yet?

27:22.370 --> 27:23.953
I mean,
the 48 hours are up.

27:23.955 --> 27:26.038
We have ten minutes left.
Just try and stay calm.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.673
Well, what if he
found out we're here?

27:27.675 --> 27:28.741
Maybe he's already killed her!

27:28.743 --> 27:30.626
Scott, please, try and relax.
Sit down.

27:34.097 --> 27:38.267
This is it.
Quiet down out there.

27:38.269 --> 27:39.719
Everyone settle.
You good?

27:39.721 --> 27:41.103
Scott, you okay?

27:41.105 --> 27:42.688
You ready?

27:42.690 --> 27:45.224
Nice and calm.

27:47.595 --> 27:49.061
Hello?

27:49.063 --> 27:50.813
You went to the cops.

27:52.532 --> 27:54.933
What? No. No, we didn't.

27:54.935 --> 27:58.437
I saw you on the street
talking to two people in suits.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.272
Uh, no, that...

28:00.274 --> 28:02.324
that was my brother
and his wife.

28:03.877 --> 28:05.995
He, uh, he's an accountant.

28:05.997 --> 28:07.797
We all went for coffee.

28:07.799 --> 28:10.332
The police aren't involved.
I swear.

28:10.334 --> 28:12.251
So my people are on the plane?

28:13.804 --> 28:16.405
Y-Yeah.
Royal Eastern Air,

28:16.407 --> 28:18.758
arrives 8:30 tomorrow morning.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.143
I knew you can do it
with the proper motivation.

28:21.145 --> 28:23.179
So we'll mt them
coming off the flight?

28:25.065 --> 28:27.483
No. We can't do it
at the airport.

28:27.485 --> 28:28.934
That was the plan.

28:28.936 --> 28:31.904
I know. But I had to use
fake passports to get them here,

28:31.906 --> 28:33.972
so the faster they're gone,
the better.

28:35.325 --> 28:37.910
I'll pick them up, and...

28:37.912 --> 28:40.362
and drop them at my office.

28:40.364 --> 28:42.981
Bring Lottie,
and we'll make the trade there.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.325
Okay.

28:55.212 --> 28:56.796
But not at your office.

28:56.798 --> 28:58.764
In the park down the street.

28:58.766 --> 29:01.667
Any tricks,
and your daughter dies.

29:04.020 --> 29:06.021
Please let us talk to Lottie

29:06.023 --> 29:07.473
just we know
she's okay.

29:07.475 --> 29:09.225
Mommy! Mommy!

29:11.728 --> 29:13.145
Did you get
a location on him?

29:13.147 --> 29:15.180
He redirected it somehow.
It's pinging

29:15.182 --> 29:16.449
all over the
five boroughs.

29:16.451 --> 29:17.399
This guy's good.

29:17.401 --> 29:20.286
Yeah. We're gonna
have to be better.

29:29.796 --> 29:32.531
I'm sorry about Jimmy.

29:32.533 --> 29:34.800
I let him fall off my radar.

29:34.802 --> 29:36.719
You and everybody else.

29:41.591 --> 29:45.311
Jerry, you've been dealing
with loss for a long time,

29:45.313 --> 29:47.096
a lot of years.

29:47.098 --> 29:48.714
Why this time?

29:48.716 --> 29:50.015
Why this time what?

29:50.017 --> 29:53.435
It sent you diving
into a whiskey bottle.

29:53.437 --> 29:55.271
You really want to talk
about my drinking?

29:55.273 --> 29:56.772
Not in the least.

29:56.774 --> 29:58.908
But when four DUI's
land on my desk,

29:58.910 --> 30:00.609
you don't leave
me much choice.

30:00.611 --> 30:02.745
I'll budget for cabs;
let's leave it at that.

30:02.747 --> 30:03.896
Let's not.

30:05.115 --> 30:08.584
The Thursday
noon-to-1:00 confessions...

30:08.586 --> 30:11.587
used to have 50 cops
go through here.

30:13.239 --> 30:15.124
And now?

30:15.126 --> 30:19.295
Spiritual problems
became chemical imbalances.

30:19.297 --> 30:23.098
Crises of faith became
a form of PTSD.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.301
There's a pill and a professional
for every crisis now,

30:25.303 --> 30:27.386
and a chaplain
may as well be a guy

30:27.388 --> 30:29.889
with a typewriter repair shop
same block as an Apple store.

30:29.891 --> 30:32.775
Self-pity has never
been your style.

30:32.777 --> 30:36.195
You have to change with the times.
Knock it off!

30:36.197 --> 30:38.480
I appreciate your coming
in person, Frank.

30:40.934 --> 30:42.785
Looks like I can close up early.

30:42.787 --> 30:44.370
Jerry...
Nobody's coming, Frank.

30:44.372 --> 30:48.624
And even if they did, I couldn't
do anything for them anymore.

30:48.626 --> 30:52.077
Stand your post, Jerry.

30:53.763 --> 30:56.582
I don't know, Frank.

30:58.084 --> 31:01.670
Day comes keeping faith feels
just like waiting by a phone...

31:01.672 --> 31:04.139
never rings.

31:04.141 --> 31:06.609
Screw it.

31:18.822 --> 31:20.105
Eight exits, two playgrounds.

31:20.107 --> 31:21.974
This park is gonna be
a nightmare.

31:21.976 --> 31:23.742
Why do you think
Kovacs chose it?

31:23.744 --> 31:25.411
Guess he's not
a dummy after all.

31:25.413 --> 31:26.812
Hey. You our guys?

31:26.814 --> 31:30.032
Which one's Croatian?
I am. Name's Horvat.

31:30.034 --> 31:32.167
All right, Horvat, this guy
asks any questions at all,

31:32.169 --> 31:34.536
you do the talking. You, just
stand there and look Croatian.

31:34.538 --> 31:36.321
Copy that, Detective.

31:36.323 --> 31:38.040
Both of you,
there's a little girl involved,

31:38.042 --> 31:40.876
so, I don't want to see any guns
until she's out of danger, okay?

31:40.878 --> 31:43.262
Scott, you ready?

31:43.264 --> 31:45.381
All right, we'll be near her
the whole time.

31:45.383 --> 31:47.049
Kovacs brings
Lottie forward,

31:47.051 --> 31:49.334
don't do anything,
don't try to be a hero.

31:49.336 --> 31:51.470
Just let these guys do
their jobs, all right?

31:51.472 --> 31:52.771
Keep your head down,

31:52.773 --> 31:54.506
we'll get your girl back
to you, make the trade.

31:54.508 --> 31:56.392
Okay.
All right, let's go. The clock's ticking.

32:08.189 --> 32:10.439
You got eyes on him yet,
partner?

32:12.275 --> 32:14.376
Not so far.

32:14.378 --> 32:16.495
Horvat, everything okay
with you guys?

32:16.497 --> 32:19.264
It's all good here, Detective.

32:25.939 --> 32:28.557
I got him. He's coming in
from the east with the girl.

32:30.176 --> 32:35.147
Scott, start walking over.
Carefully.

32:45.959 --> 32:47.493
Lottie?

32:47.495 --> 32:48.494
Daddy?

32:48.496 --> 32:49.912
It's okay, Lottie.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.331
Stop right there.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.583
Please. I brought them
like you asked.

32:54.585 --> 32:56.585
Just let her go.

33:14.737 --> 33:17.356
Who's the mayor of Zagreb?

33:17.358 --> 33:19.024
Milan Bandic.

33:20.726 --> 33:22.277
In Zagreb, what highway

33:22.279 --> 33:25.197
runs to Rijeka?

33:27.567 --> 33:29.501
What highway runs to Rijeka?

33:29.503 --> 33:30.536
Kovacs, never mind him.

33:30.538 --> 33:31.870
He's shy.

33:31.872 --> 33:32.871
Those are not my men.

33:32.873 --> 33:34.373
Kovacs?

33:34.375 --> 33:35.907
Let the girl go.

33:37.510 --> 33:38.594
Come on, I know you got a heart.

33:38.596 --> 33:39.761
You don't want
to kill a little girl.

33:39.763 --> 33:41.346
You're right.

33:41.348 --> 33:42.414
Lottie!

33:42.416 --> 33:44.349
Lottie! Lottie!

33:44.351 --> 33:46.802
Hold it!

33:48.689 --> 33:49.771
It's okay, Lottie.

33:49.773 --> 33:50.922
Come with me.

33:54.928 --> 33:55.927
Kovacs!

34:00.050 --> 34:02.150
Come on! Come on!

34:03.537 --> 34:06.238
Stay down!

34:08.041 --> 34:09.658
Hold it!

34:11.777 --> 34:12.744
Hold it!

34:14.715 --> 34:17.833
I got the girl.
It's over.

34:17.835 --> 34:19.451
You ain't gonna shoot me
in the back.

34:19.453 --> 34:22.337
Try me.

34:28.228 --> 34:30.478
Guess I won't have to.

34:35.435 --> 34:37.436
Stay in the vehicles.

34:37.438 --> 34:39.855
Oh, my gosh.

34:45.762 --> 34:47.696
He done?

34:47.697 --> 34:50.331
Yeah, he forgot
to look both ways.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.333
How's Lottie?

34:52.335 --> 34:54.253
Got to get her to the
hospital to be sure,

34:54.255 --> 34:56.538
but from the way she hugged
her dad, yeah, she'll be fine.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.006
Oh, that's all that matters.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.591
Cold cuff him.

35:03.546 --> 35:06.131
I got a phone call this morning
from Pirate Bob,

35:06.133 --> 35:08.183
who says that the blues
are running so thick

35:08.185 --> 35:09.468
off the Rockaway Inlet,

35:09.470 --> 35:11.350
they  re calling it catching
instead of fishing.

35:11.888 --> 35:13.004
We should book it.

35:13.006 --> 35:14.106
Yeah, when's available?

35:14.108 --> 35:15.440
Tuesday dawn.

35:15.442 --> 35:16.642
Sounds great.
Count me in.

35:17.978 --> 35:20.279
What?! You don't like to fish.

35:20.281 --> 35:21.513
Yeah, but I like to catch.

35:21.515 --> 35:23.515
You have the attention
span of a gnat.

35:23.517 --> 35:25.350
Thanks, Dad.

35:25.352 --> 35:27.619
Danny's going fishing.

35:27.621 --> 35:29.955
Jamie, I just got a text.

35:29.957 --> 35:32.524
Know that collar you asked me
to look into?

35:32.526 --> 35:34.042
Yeah, Grady Bayless.

35:34.044 --> 35:38.080
Yeah. Hung himself in his cell
at Rikers this morning.

35:41.968 --> 35:43.752
I'm sorry.

35:46.589 --> 35:48.873
Damn.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.477
You okay?

35:52.479 --> 35:56.047
Yeah. May he rest in peace, huh?

36:02.605 --> 36:05.324
...which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

36:05.326 --> 36:07.058
Through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.694
Amen.

36:08.696 --> 36:10.946
Amen.

36:10.948 --> 36:13.915
Did anybody else think church
was really boring today?

36:13.917 --> 36:15.117
Not me.

36:15.119 --> 36:16.418
Brownnoser. You did, too.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.569
Hey.

36:17.571 --> 36:19.087
Tell us how
you really feel, Sean.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.006
Well, you weren't the only one
who was bored.

36:21.008 --> 36:22.174
Grandpa was nodding off.

36:22.176 --> 36:24.760
I was engaged in contemplation.

36:24.762 --> 36:26.128
Sean, I'm not sure the point

36:26.130 --> 36:28.130
of going to church is
to be entertained.

36:28.132 --> 36:29.348
I'm not saying
entertained,

36:29.350 --> 36:30.915
but, you know,
just interested.

36:30.917 --> 36:32.718
You know what
I like to do?

36:32.720 --> 36:34.186
Daydream.

36:34.188 --> 36:35.920
You know where
you're going with this?

36:35.922 --> 36:37.088
Yes, I do.

36:37.090 --> 36:39.090
I listen to the
sermon and what

36:39.092 --> 36:41.026
it says about
faith and mercy

36:41.028 --> 36:42.027
and perseverance,

36:42.029 --> 36:43.562
and I just
try to apply it

36:43.564 --> 36:45.230
to something that's
relevant in my own life.

36:45.232 --> 36:46.314
Okay.

36:46.316 --> 36:48.066
Like what?
Like...

36:48.068 --> 36:50.035
say, the sermon
is about faith.

36:50.037 --> 36:52.103
Like it was today.
Yeah.

36:52.105 --> 36:55.107
Faith can be a very vague idea

36:55.109 --> 36:56.875
until you put it in your own

36:56.877 --> 36:58.577
words and thoughts.
Right.

36:59.579 --> 37:01.797
So, maybe try

37:01.799 --> 37:03.948
thinking of God's plan for you

37:03.950 --> 37:06.668
if, say, for instance,
you had a penalty kick

37:06.670 --> 37:09.388
in a tie game with seconds left
on the clock.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.555
Yeah.
I see.

37:10.557 --> 37:12.391
There you go.

37:13.426 --> 37:16.428
But all we play is
other Catholic schools.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.797
How can God
take sides?

37:24.854 --> 37:27.272
Faith isn't about results
exactly.

37:27.274 --> 37:29.524
Or about keeping score

37:29.526 --> 37:30.692
really.

37:30.694 --> 37:31.943
Well, I didn't mean it
literally.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.578
It's complicated.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.780
Even when you grow up.

37:34.782 --> 37:35.980
That's right.

37:35.982 --> 37:37.616
It's not all about
guarantees, boys.

37:37.618 --> 37:38.950
Mm-hmm.
It's just faith.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.118
I'm really confused.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.720
Me, too.

37:41.722 --> 37:43.321
'Cause it is confusing,

37:43.323 --> 37:46.174
because even when you do
what seems like the right thing,

37:46.176 --> 37:49.961
sometimes... things still
turn out wrong.

37:50.763 --> 37:52.464
Can shake your faith.

37:52.466 --> 37:54.266
Anybody's.

38:19.459 --> 38:20.826
Police! Freeze!

38:26.015 --> 38:28.166
They let deputy commissioners

38:28.168 --> 38:29.801
say that?

38:29.803 --> 38:32.871
I'm not sure,
but I always wanted to, so...

38:35.174 --> 38:37.175
You banged in sick.
You don't look sick to me.

38:37.177 --> 38:38.710
Thanks, Doc.

38:38.712 --> 38:40.479
Don't you want to know
how I knew you'd be here?

38:40.481 --> 38:42.514
Somebody gave you a list
of likely locations

38:42.516 --> 38:44.382
and sticking their nose
in my business?

38:44.384 --> 38:46.601
Good guess, but wrong.

38:48.104 --> 38:50.105
How?

38:50.107 --> 38:51.823
Your father needs a favor.

38:51.825 --> 38:53.725
What kind of favor?

38:53.727 --> 38:55.226
Pump a guy up?

38:59.732 --> 39:01.900
I'm not his guy, not today.

39:01.902 --> 39:04.870
Do you really want me to go back
and report that?

39:05.705 --> 39:07.739
This an order?

39:07.741 --> 39:09.925
When he asks a favor...

39:09.927 --> 39:11.877
I file it under order.

39:11.879 --> 39:14.078
You?

39:19.185 --> 39:21.219
Where's the guy?

39:21.221 --> 39:23.588
I'm dropping you.
I need to change for this?

39:23.590 --> 39:26.925
No. It's come-as-you-are.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.242
You're not coming?

39:44.244 --> 39:45.327
No.

39:45.329 --> 39:47.045
Who am I looking for then?

39:47.047 --> 39:50.465
Oh, he'll find you...
or you'll find him.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.971
Can I help you?

40:12.973 --> 40:14.522
Not really sure
what I'm doing here.

40:14.524 --> 40:16.975
I was sent here by my father--
Commissioner Reagan?

40:19.028 --> 40:21.246
I can't say
I got the memo, either.

40:21.248 --> 40:22.814
Father Markham.

40:22.816 --> 40:24.282
Jamie Reagan.

40:24.284 --> 40:25.834
I'm, uh, department chaplain.

40:25.836 --> 40:28.837
Ah.

40:28.839 --> 40:30.488
Something on your mind?

40:33.960 --> 40:36.294
Nothing I can't figure out
on my own.

40:37.213 --> 40:38.263
No disrespect.

40:38.265 --> 40:40.465
None taken.

40:41.968 --> 40:44.185
Good day, Father.

40:47.172 --> 40:49.140
Listen, I was...

40:49.142 --> 40:52.343
I just put a pot of coffee
on over in the rectory.

40:52.345 --> 40:55.313
I make damned good coffee.

40:55.315 --> 40:57.399
You came all the way out here.

40:57.401 --> 40:59.618
At least join me for a cup?

41:06.959 --> 41:10.245
Sure. Thank you, Father.
