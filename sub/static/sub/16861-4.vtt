WEBVTT

00:03.130 --> 00:04.846
your sister Jeanie, she's

00:04.882 --> 00:06.564
Sick. I can't cover the nut

00:06.599 --> 00:07.395
But...

00:07.430 --> 00:08.746
stand up and get yourself a

00:08.781 --> 00:10.063
Job before they toss her out in

00:10.098 --> 00:11.195
The street.

00:11.230 --> 00:11.928
Hey, listen, is there any

00:11.963 --> 00:12.831
Chance you could float me that

00:12.866 --> 00:13.896
Money we talked about?

00:13.931 --> 00:14.797
I'm sorry, jer. I'm tapped

00:14.832 --> 00:15.429
Out.

00:15.464 --> 00:16.129
I was depending upon that

00:16.165 --> 00:16.829
Money for Jeanie...

00:16.864 --> 00:17.780
Christ, Jerry, what do I look

00:17.815 --> 00:18.697
Like, a goddamn atm machine to

00:18.732 --> 00:19.796
You?!

00:19.831 --> 00:20.963
I saw your sign outside and

00:20.998 --> 00:22.447
I'm looking to pick up a couple

00:22.482 --> 00:23.606
Of extra bucks. I am a little

00:23.641 --> 00:24.730
Bit rusty, but I used to pour it

00:24.765 --> 00:25.662
Down at mchale's.

00:25.697 --> 00:27.280
You don't want to talk to me,

00:27.315 --> 00:28.772
You can talk to my new lawyer.

00:28.807 --> 00:30.102
After this shit and the shit you

00:30.137 --> 00:31.500
Pulled the other night, I will

00:31.535 --> 00:32.864
Get it all... the girls, the

00:32.899 --> 00:34.497
Money, the furniture,

00:34.532 --> 00:35.328
Everything.

00:35.363 --> 00:37.213
You know, you've been acting

00:37.248 --> 00:38.689
Very unlou-Like lately, Lou.

00:38.724 --> 00:40.130
What are you talking about?

00:40.165 --> 00:40.998
You want to help me?

00:41.033 --> 00:41.796
We're brothers.

00:41.831 --> 00:43.030
Save this intervention for

00:43.065 --> 00:44.114
Somebody who gives a shit.

00:44.149 --> 00:45.163
Has he talked to you about

00:45.198 --> 00:45.896
Maggie yet?

00:45.931 --> 00:46.980
No, God, no. I was waiting

00:47.015 --> 00:48.139
For the right time, you know,

00:48.174 --> 00:49.263
Seems a little raw after the

00:49.298 --> 00:50.214
Whole Johnny thing.

00:50.249 --> 00:51.095
He seems fine to me.

00:51.130 --> 00:51.897
Yeah, but he was doing this

00:51.932 --> 00:52.981
Whole bristling thing.

00:53.016 --> 00:54.030
He was bristling?

00:54.065 --> 00:54.796
Yeah.

00:54.831 --> 00:55.595
He knows.

00:55.630 --> 00:56.630
I think he might know.

00:56.665 --> 00:57.630
If he knew, you'd be in a

00:57.665 --> 00:58.928
Body cast by now.

00:58.963 --> 01:00.897
So, is this a gift from your

01:00.932 --> 01:02.547
Old lady? Sorry. Girlfriend.

01:02.582 --> 01:04.163
She's not old, Lou. She's

01:04.197 --> 01:04.861
Older.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.063
Older lady with a shitload of

01:06.098 --> 01:06.928
Money.

01:06.963 --> 01:08.430
What's with the long face?

01:08.465 --> 01:09.762
What?

01:09.797 --> 01:12.262
What, Mrs. Turbody?

01:12.297 --> 01:13.130
I'm in love with her, uncle

01:13.165 --> 01:13.896
Tommy.

01:13.931 --> 01:15.197
You don't know what love is.

01:15.232 --> 01:16.464
Why don't we discuss this off

01:16.499 --> 01:18.048
School grounds?

01:18.083 --> 01:19.562
Over drinks.

01:19.597 --> 01:22.097
If I end that thing, I'm going

01:22.132 --> 01:24.597
To need another thing to take

01:24.632 --> 01:26.031
That thing's place.

01:26.066 --> 01:27.430
Call me Mrs. Turbody!

01:27.465 --> 01:29.297
Mrs. Turbody!

01:29.332 --> 01:31.130
Yes! Oh, yes!

01:37.963 --> 01:39.297
Hey, did you see the kitty?

01:39.332 --> 01:40.295
Where?

01:40.330 --> 01:41.597
No, the smoking kitty. I

01:41.632 --> 01:42.864
Checked it out this morning.

01:42.899 --> 01:43.961
Almost 1,200 bucks.

01:43.996 --> 01:44.979
Call it the can, OK? If you

01:45.014 --> 01:45.963
Can't call it the can, don't

01:45.998 --> 01:46.995
Call it anything.

01:47.030 --> 01:48.297
Talk to your brother yet,

01:48.332 --> 01:48.928
Tom?

01:48.963 --> 01:49.762
No. Piece of shit. If he

01:49.797 --> 01:51.013
Knows what's good for him, he'll

01:51.048 --> 01:52.172
Stay outta my way from now until

01:52.207 --> 01:53.335
The time I leave this planet.

01:53.370 --> 01:54.333
Yeah, that was a real beating

01:54.368 --> 01:55.297
You put into him the other

01:55.332 --> 01:55.961
Night.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.263
Yeah. Well, that's how we do

01:57.298 --> 01:58.864
It in the Gavin family. Settle

01:58.899 --> 02:00.430
Things with our fists. My uncles

02:00.465 --> 02:01.681
Did it, my aunts. Even my

02:01.716 --> 02:03.140
Sisters. One time when I was

02:03.175 --> 02:04.564
Like 9, my cousin liam threw my

02:04.599 --> 02:05.897
Batmobile in the toilet...

02:05.932 --> 02:06.862
holy shit!

02:06.897 --> 02:08.062
Stop the truck, nils!

02:08.098 --> 02:08.695
What?

02:08.729 --> 02:09.829
Stop the truck!

02:09.864 --> 02:10.564
Stop the goddamn truck! You

02:10.598 --> 02:11.248
Guys see that?

02:11.283 --> 02:11.862
Is it a broad?

02:11.897 --> 02:12.730
It's a bus. It's a school bus

02:12.765 --> 02:13.564
In the middle of the road.

02:13.599 --> 02:14.362
Franco, we're in the

02:14.397 --> 02:15.413
Middle of a goddamn run. We stop

02:15.448 --> 02:16.430
Here, we gotta clear it with

02:16.465 --> 02:17.297
Jerry first.

02:17.332 --> 02:18.231
So clear it!

02:18.266 --> 02:19.095
What happened?

02:19.130 --> 02:19.897
There's a bus full of kids.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.429
You guys are fast!

02:21.464 --> 02:22.547
I'm still on hold with 911. I

02:22.582 --> 02:23.630
Think the kids might be hurt or

02:23.665 --> 02:25.762
Something.

02:25.797 --> 02:26.613
Out of the way, guys. Out of

02:26.648 --> 02:27.430
The way, out of the way.

02:27.465 --> 02:28.228
We're stuck!

02:28.263 --> 02:29.395
It'll be OK, kids.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.397
The seats are jamming up the

02:30.432 --> 02:31.264
Front. We can't get in.

02:31.299 --> 02:32.131
All right. We're going up

02:32.166 --> 02:32.928
Top. Probie, come on.

02:32.963 --> 02:34.180
Nils, I need you to get the

02:34.215 --> 02:35.397
Partners over here right away.

02:35.432 --> 02:36.228
Where are you?

02:36.263 --> 02:37.063
I'm gonna grab the portable

02:37.098 --> 02:37.981
Ladder, frank.

02:38.016 --> 02:38.829
Stay calm, guys.

02:38.864 --> 02:39.780
Contacted the dispatch that

02:39.815 --> 02:40.697
We've arrived at the scene at

02:40.732 --> 02:42.128
117 St. Nicholas.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.296
Move out of the way of the

02:43.331 --> 02:44.430
Window! Cover your heads with

02:44.465 --> 02:46.397
Your jackets!

02:46.432 --> 02:48.031
Go ahead!

02:48.066 --> 02:49.595
You got it?

02:49.630 --> 02:54.762
Yeah. Yeah.

02:54.797 --> 02:56.547
All right, mikey. Here we go.

02:56.582 --> 02:58.297
Hey, what about that other

02:58.332 --> 02:59.262
Job? Was it a fire?

02:59.297 --> 03:00.130
No, it wasn't a fire. It was

03:00.165 --> 03:01.864
A cardiac. 72 truckers

03:01.899 --> 03:02.595
Responded to it.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.597
All right, kids first. OK.

03:04.632 --> 03:06.195
Here you go, pal.

03:06.230 --> 03:08.096
Come here, bud. Ready? I got

03:08.131 --> 03:09.963
You. Go ahead. You got him?

03:09.998 --> 03:11.197
My arm hurts.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.397
You play sports?

03:12.432 --> 03:12.995
No.

03:13.030 --> 03:13.695
Then your arm's not

03:13.730 --> 03:14.480
Really an issue, now is it?

03:14.515 --> 03:15.230
There you go. Keep your feet

03:15.265 --> 03:15.862
On the...

03:15.897 --> 03:17.063
you have to help beth!

03:17.098 --> 03:18.230
You got her? Beth?

03:18.265 --> 03:19.548
Where's beth?

03:19.583 --> 03:20.796
In front.

03:20.831 --> 03:22.928
OK. There you go. Probie?

03:22.963 --> 03:24.630
When you get done with her, come

03:24.665 --> 03:26.297
Inside and help the driver out,

03:26.332 --> 03:27.064
All right?

03:27.099 --> 03:29.314
OK. Got it.

03:29.349 --> 03:31.640
Beth! Beth!

03:31.675 --> 03:33.469
Oh, shit.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.817
Probie?

03:34.852 --> 03:36.095
Yeah?

03:36.130 --> 03:37.096
We're gonna need the saw.

03:37.131 --> 03:38.780
OK!

03:38.815 --> 03:40.395
Shit!

03:40.430 --> 03:42.096
All right, hang on, sweetheart.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.080
Tommy, hold up a sec.

03:52.115 --> 03:53.822
Hold up a sec, all right?

03:53.857 --> 03:55.530
What's going on out there,

03:55.565 --> 03:56.262
Lou?

03:56.297 --> 03:56.995
Listen, we got gas leaking

03:57.030 --> 03:58.080
Out here. It's pooling up in the

03:58.115 --> 03:59.206
Street. Do not use the partner

03:59.241 --> 04:00.297
Saw, do you hear me? Do not use

04:00.332 --> 04:01.928
The partner saw.

04:01.963 --> 04:02.961
I don't want to wait, man.

04:02.996 --> 04:04.213
Her leg's stuck under this pipe

04:04.248 --> 04:05.430
In here and she's in a lot of

04:05.465 --> 04:06.195
Pain.

04:06.230 --> 04:07.613
We got Franco flying in with

04:07.648 --> 04:08.996
The saw. Do not use it. Copy

04:09.031 --> 04:09.762
That!

04:09.797 --> 04:10.562
One spark in the wrong

04:10.597 --> 04:11.430
Direction... just hold off on the

04:11.465 --> 04:12.562
Goddamn saw. Copy?

04:12.597 --> 04:15.530
All right. You know what? Go.

04:15.565 --> 04:16.730
What are you gonna do?

04:16.765 --> 04:17.529
Go.

04:17.564 --> 04:18.497
Don't worry about it. Hurry up.

04:18.531 --> 04:19.695
All right.

04:19.730 --> 04:20.831
All right, sweetheart. Close

04:20.866 --> 04:22.162
Your eyes for me, OK?

05:40.630 --> 05:42.495
These men had a duty to

05:42.530 --> 05:45.380
Perform. They were supposed to

05:45.415 --> 05:47.606
Be responding to a distress call

05:47.641 --> 05:49.797
From a member of the community

05:49.832 --> 05:52.263
They serve. Instead, they

05:52.298 --> 05:52.995
Decided...

05:53.030 --> 05:53.829
unbelievable, man.

05:53.864 --> 05:55.463
To ignore that call to help

05:55.498 --> 05:57.314
Some wealthy white children

05:57.349 --> 05:59.130
Outside of the community. Now,

05:59.165 --> 06:00.262
I'm not against helping

06:00.297 --> 06:02.747
Children, but once again, the

06:02.782 --> 06:05.472
City has ignored its citizens of

06:05.507 --> 06:08.163
Color. I, for one, am calling

06:08.198 --> 06:09.931
For a full and thorough

06:09.966 --> 06:10.995
Investigation.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.629
He's kidding, right?

06:12.664 --> 06:13.664
Every once in a while you see

06:13.699 --> 06:14.964
Something going down and you

06:14.999 --> 06:16.948
Have to make a snap judgment

06:16.983 --> 06:19.090
Call. In this case, it was a man

06:19.125 --> 06:21.610
In distress. Chest pains versus

06:21.645 --> 06:23.837
A bus load of kids. And I made

06:23.872 --> 06:26.151
The call. I didn't stop to think

06:26.186 --> 06:28.574
What color the kids were. Black,

06:28.609 --> 06:30.963
White, green. They're kids. We

06:30.998 --> 06:32.695
Just did our job.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.180
There has been no mention of

06:34.215 --> 06:35.605
An investigation from FDNY

You believe this bullshit?

06:43.332 --> 06:44.629
This sucks, man. I thought

06:44.664 --> 06:45.813
We'd be heroes after that save.

06:45.848 --> 06:46.789
I'm the one that should be

06:46.824 --> 06:48.010
Complaining. Did you see the

06:48.045 --> 06:49.197
Name up there? Jerry o'Reilly?

06:49.232 --> 06:49.995
Who the hell is that?

06:50.030 --> 06:51.347
I am done. Look at that. I'm

06:51.382 --> 06:52.539
Moving to the woods and eating

06:52.574 --> 06:53.519
Nuts and squirrels and then I'm

06:53.554 --> 06:54.492
Gonna set the woods on fire and

06:54.527 --> 06:55.912
Not tell anybody until it's too

06:55.947 --> 06:57.297
Late. Look! "FDNY leaves man for

06:57.332 --> 06:58.064
Dead."

06:58.099 --> 06:58.762
Christ!

06:58.797 --> 06:59.497
Could be worse.

06:59.532 --> 07:00.162
How?

07:00.197 --> 07:00.963
Could say: "Jerry o'Reilly

07:00.998 --> 07:02.096
Leaves man for dead."

07:02.131 --> 07:02.928
What?

07:02.963 --> 07:03.763
You know what, just for the

07:03.798 --> 07:04.664
Record, not all those kids were

07:04.699 --> 07:05.530
White. OK? There was one black

07:05.565 --> 07:06.429
Kid.

07:06.464 --> 07:07.880
No, I think he had a tan.

07:07.915 --> 07:09.239
Nah, that wasn't a tan. He

07:09.274 --> 07:10.564
Was Egyptian or something.

07:10.599 --> 07:11.429
Egyptian?

07:11.464 --> 07:12.597
Yeah, from some other country

07:12.632 --> 07:13.730
Over there. His old man was an

07:13.765 --> 07:14.629
Ambassador.

07:14.664 --> 07:15.480
Well, why doesn't his father

07:15.515 --> 07:16.297
Step forward and say something?

07:16.332 --> 07:17.028
Give us some support.

07:17.063 --> 07:18.313
Well, he would've, but he was

07:18.348 --> 07:19.872
Keeping a low profile. Seems he

07:19.907 --> 07:21.397
Got mixed up in that diplomatic

07:21.432 --> 07:22.529
License plate bullshit or

07:22.564 --> 07:23.897
Something. The embassy called,

07:23.932 --> 07:25.230
Though. They're sending over a

07:25.265 --> 07:26.195
Fruit basket.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.630
Hey, boys. See the fruit?

07:27.665 --> 07:29.030
Yeah, we were just talking

07:29.065 --> 07:29.931
About the fruit.

07:29.966 --> 07:30.695
Yeah?

07:30.730 --> 07:31.395
Hey, speaking of keeping a

07:31.430 --> 07:32.797
Low profile, I want you guys to

07:32.832 --> 07:33.729
Do the same. Don't talk to

07:33.764 --> 07:35.030
Anybody about this. Don't mix it

07:35.065 --> 07:36.297
Up with the neighbors if there's

07:36.332 --> 07:37.564
Any kind of a protest, huh?

07:37.599 --> 07:38.814
Little bit of luck, this thing

07:38.849 --> 07:39.989
Might just blow over. All right?

07:40.024 --> 07:41.130
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have

07:41.165 --> 07:41.928
To go upstairs and get

07:41.963 --> 07:43.180
Perrolli's boot up my ass for

07:43.215 --> 07:44.397
Another half hour. Save me some

07:44.432 --> 07:45.429
Papaya.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.295
Hey, Tommy, can I

07:46.330 --> 07:47.163
Talk to you in the other room

07:47.198 --> 07:47.831
For a second?

07:47.866 --> 07:48.429
No.

07:48.464 --> 07:49.197
Why? It's important.

07:49.232 --> 07:50.147
No. No.

07:50.182 --> 07:51.056
Please?

07:51.091 --> 07:51.896
No!

07:51.931 --> 07:53.028
It's personal.

07:53.063 --> 07:54.063
Oh, OK. Well, then, of

07:54.098 --> 07:57.128
Course.

07:57.163 --> 07:58.797
Hey, Lou, you mind giving us

07:58.832 --> 07:59.631
A minute?

07:59.666 --> 08:00.395
Blow me.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.664
No, I'm serious, l...

08:01.699 --> 08:02.695
so am I.

08:02.730 --> 08:03.797
Why don't we go to the locker

08:03.832 --> 08:04.462
Room? It's private.

08:04.497 --> 08:05.530
Garrity, I've already moved

08:05.565 --> 08:06.581
Once. I'm not moving again. Say

08:06.616 --> 08:07.597
What you have to say. Get it

08:07.632 --> 08:08.629
Over with. Let's go.

08:08.664 --> 08:11.197
All right. Jesus. I just...

08:11.232 --> 08:13.364
ahem. A little while ago I did

08:13.399 --> 08:15.264
This thing I probably should've

08:15.299 --> 08:17.131
Asked you about and I didn't and

08:17.166 --> 08:18.963
I need you to promise me you're

08:18.998 --> 08:20.580
Not going to hit me.

08:20.615 --> 08:22.622
Why would I hit you?

08:22.657 --> 08:24.595
Well, just listen.

08:24.630 --> 08:25.863
I, uh, you know this girl that

08:25.898 --> 08:28.464
I've been, as you may know, been

08:28.499 --> 08:31.165
Dating, this woman, this lady,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.831
This person happens, um, to be...

08:33.866 --> 08:35.462
my sister Maggie.

08:35.496 --> 08:37.096
What? How the hell did you

08:37.131 --> 08:37.895
Know that?

08:37.931 --> 08:39.230
My dad's birthday party.

08:39.265 --> 08:40.530
Yeah, but I didn't say

08:40.565 --> 08:41.195
Anything...

08:41.230 --> 08:42.128
you gave yourself away.

08:42.163 --> 08:42.996
What are you talking about?

08:43.030 --> 08:43.897
You took her cherry.

08:43.932 --> 08:44.729
I took her cherry?

08:44.764 --> 08:45.595
Wait, wait, no offense,

08:45.630 --> 08:46.846
Guys, but this is Maggie we're

08:46.881 --> 08:48.438
Talking about, seems to me that

08:48.473 --> 08:49.961
Particular event might have

08:49.996 --> 08:51.996
Happened around fifth grade or...

08:52.031 --> 08:53.464
ha ha. Very funny.

08:53.499 --> 08:54.862
Fourth grade.

08:54.897 --> 08:56.695
You took her cherry three

08:56.730 --> 08:58.147
Times out of her drink, OK? You

08:58.182 --> 08:59.439
Took her cherry out. That's a

08:59.474 --> 09:00.535
Very personal gesture. Only

09:00.570 --> 09:01.683
Someone who knows somebody very

09:01.718 --> 09:02.797
Well would do that. OK? You gave

09:02.832 --> 09:03.629
Yourself away.

09:03.664 --> 09:04.562
OK. Well, whatever.

09:04.597 --> 09:06.230
The point is... what I'm trying to

09:06.265 --> 09:09.028
Say... is that I...

09:09.063 --> 09:10.829
I'm in love with her, OK?

09:10.864 --> 09:12.697
You're in love with my sister

09:12.732 --> 09:13.531
Maggie?

09:13.566 --> 09:14.364
Yes.

09:14.399 --> 09:15.128
OK.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.713
Ow! Jesus, I thought you said

09:16.748 --> 09:18.072
You weren't going to hit me.

09:18.107 --> 09:19.397
You just said you love her.

09:19.432 --> 09:20.847
I do love her.

09:20.882 --> 09:22.228
Son of a bitch!

09:22.263 --> 09:23.028
Four million women in new

09:23.063 --> 09:24.246
York city and you got to pick my

09:24.281 --> 09:25.430
Crazy sister. She's nuts. She's

09:25.465 --> 09:26.262
Certifiable.

09:26.297 --> 09:27.163
You know what, Tom? You're

09:27.198 --> 09:28.030
Just jealous. That's what you

09:28.065 --> 09:28.695
Are.

09:28.730 --> 09:29.595
I'm jealous. I am trying to

09:29.630 --> 09:31.197
Help you here. Hypothetical. You

09:31.232 --> 09:32.448
And I go to the zoo. You climb

09:32.483 --> 09:33.523
Into the bear exhibit with a

09:33.558 --> 09:34.527
Stick and you start poking the

09:34.562 --> 09:35.462
Bear with the stick. You'd

09:35.497 --> 09:36.730
Expect me to either pull you out

09:36.765 --> 09:37.597
Or call somebody for help,

09:37.632 --> 09:38.397
Right?

09:38.432 --> 09:39.128
Right.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.047
OK. It's the same situation,

09:40.082 --> 09:41.373
Except my sister's the bear and

09:41.408 --> 09:42.664
The stick is your cock. Got it?

09:46.630 --> 09:47.829
Uh... look, I don't care

09:47.864 --> 09:54.030
What you say, OK? I love her.

09:54.065 --> 09:56.263
Are you crying over my

09:56.298 --> 09:57.328
Sister Maggie?

09:57.363 --> 09:58.295
No, I'm not. You

09:58.330 --> 10:02.495
Just... you hurt my nose.

10:02.530 --> 10:06.030
<i>Charles bronson. Death wish.</i>

10:06.065 --> 10:09.495
Ahem. Speaking of which,

10:09.530 --> 10:11.664
You have, uh, something you want

10:11.699 --> 10:13.031
To say to me?

10:13.066 --> 10:14.328
About what?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.330
OK. Well, for one example,

10:15.365 --> 10:16.262
The other day when you were

10:16.297 --> 10:17.397
Talking to the probie and I came

10:17.432 --> 10:18.362
Up and tried to join the

10:18.397 --> 10:21.163
Conversation and you jumped down

10:21.198 --> 10:22.564
My goddamn throat.

10:22.599 --> 10:23.931
You're waiting for an

10:23.966 --> 10:25.164
Apology?

10:25.199 --> 10:26.328
Yeah.

10:26.363 --> 10:30.597
Keep waiting, pal.

10:30.632 --> 10:31.864
All right.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.297
Hey, what's up, kid?

10:36.332 --> 10:37.796
Hey.

10:37.831 --> 10:38.831
I used to come out here everyday

10:38.866 --> 10:39.914
Around this time and have a

10:39.949 --> 10:40.963
Smoke. Now I just come out and

10:40.998 --> 10:42.295
Breathe. It sucks.

10:42.330 --> 10:44.464
Any sign of trouble in the

10:44.499 --> 10:45.429
Neighborhood?

10:45.464 --> 10:46.547
Nah. Nothing. I guess nobody

10:46.582 --> 10:48.723
Reads the paper or watches the

10:48.758 --> 10:50.611
News around here, you know? Hey,

10:50.646 --> 10:53.088
Chief, you think it's weird that

10:53.123 --> 10:55.426
I'm seeing this older woman?

10:55.461 --> 10:57.612
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.764
She sure is a good-Looking

10:59.799 --> 11:00.796
Dame, Franco.

11:00.831 --> 11:02.497
Yeah, but, you know, the age

11:02.532 --> 11:03.931
Thing. Not to mention she's rich

11:03.966 --> 11:05.098
And I'm pretty much piss poor.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.331
You're the one that's gotta

11:06.366 --> 11:07.648
Spend the time with her. It

11:07.683 --> 11:09.223
Shouldn't much matter what I

11:09.258 --> 11:10.764
Think. Or maybe that's the

11:10.799 --> 11:12.829
Issue.

11:12.864 --> 11:17.363
It's all right, kid.

11:23.497 --> 11:24.429
Oh!

11:24.464 --> 11:27.664
I'm so wasted! Aah! Whoo!

11:27.699 --> 11:29.695
Ha ha ha!

11:29.730 --> 11:31.363
Yeah, honey, I remember my

11:31.398 --> 11:35.395
First beer.

11:35.430 --> 11:36.963
Larry, I'm going to take a

11:36.998 --> 11:38.414
Fiver. My back is killing me.

11:38.449 --> 11:39.756
Hey, grab a mop first. You're

11:39.791 --> 11:40.960
Little friend the captain of the

11:40.995 --> 11:42.130
Cheerleading squad just lost her

11:42.165 --> 11:43.562
Shit in the urinal.

11:43.597 --> 11:44.397
What the hell was she doing

11:44.432 --> 11:45.195
In the men's room?

11:45.230 --> 11:46.096
She doesn't know what state

11:46.131 --> 11:46.928
She's in, let alone what

11:46.963 --> 11:48.597
Bathroom. Get on that, huh? Guys

11:48.632 --> 11:49.497
Go in and see puke in the

11:49.532 --> 11:50.464
Urinal, it's gonna set off a

11:50.499 --> 11:51.331
Chain reaction. Then you're

11:51.366 --> 11:52.163
Gonna have a real mess on your

11:52.198 --> 11:53.014
Hands.

11:53.049 --> 11:53.796
Right.

11:53.831 --> 11:55.030
Hey, Jerry! I need ice. How

11:55.065 --> 11:56.181
Many times I have to ask?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.156
You're next, sweetheart.

11:58.191 --> 12:00.061
Right after the puke.

12:00.096 --> 12:02.996
Hey, what the hell? What's

12:03.031 --> 12:04.529
Going on?

12:04.564 --> 12:05.897
Your father had like an old

12:05.932 --> 12:07.264
Man nostalgia panic attack and

12:07.299 --> 12:08.597
Went through all of the albums

12:08.632 --> 12:10.597
And then he fell down.

12:10.632 --> 12:11.362
Is he all right?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.196
Yeah. He went to the bathroom

12:13.231 --> 12:14.680
When I wasn't looking and then

12:14.715 --> 12:15.989
He fell down and hit his head on

12:16.024 --> 12:17.110
The toilet and I wouldn't let

12:17.145 --> 12:18.087
Him go to sleep because, you

12:18.122 --> 12:19.076
Know, when you have a concussion

12:19.111 --> 12:20.030
And you go to sleep, it's like...

12:20.065 --> 12:21.996
right, right, right. So,

12:22.031 --> 12:23.228
Where is he now?

12:23.263 --> 12:25.095
Sleeping. Well, he was

12:25.130 --> 12:26.263
Begging me. And I'm like, all

12:26.298 --> 12:27.280
Right. You want to go to sleep,

12:27.315 --> 12:28.239
You might not wake up. And he

12:28.274 --> 12:29.135
Goes, I don't care. And I said,

12:29.170 --> 12:31.066
Fine, you know what? My hands

12:31.101 --> 12:32.732
Are clean. Are you hungry?

12:32.767 --> 12:34.363
No. I had a slice on the way

12:34.398 --> 12:36.131
Home. So he's OK?

12:36.166 --> 12:37.681
Yes, he's fine!

12:37.716 --> 12:39.162
All right!

12:39.197 --> 12:40.113
Listen, if you want to worry

12:40.148 --> 12:41.055
About somebody, why don't you

12:41.090 --> 12:42.593
Worry about me? I got to sit

12:42.628 --> 12:44.046
Here and listen to him all day.

12:44.081 --> 12:45.555
"I need a grandson, I need a

12:45.590 --> 12:46.843
Male heir. I'm not gonna rest

12:46.878 --> 12:48.520
Until I have another Gavin in

12:48.555 --> 12:50.163
The FDNY." It is making me

12:50.198 --> 12:50.862
Crazy.

12:50.897 --> 12:51.730
I know. I'm sick of that

12:51.765 --> 12:53.264
Speech myself.

12:53.299 --> 12:54.729
Anyway...

12:54.764 --> 12:57.164
I think that, um, I have a

12:57.199 --> 12:59.464
Solution to the problem.

12:59.499 --> 13:01.681
And which problem is this?

13:01.716 --> 13:03.906
The male heir situation.

13:03.941 --> 13:06.061
OK. What would that be?

13:06.096 --> 13:07.963
I thought about it from every

13:07.998 --> 13:08.781
Angle.

13:08.816 --> 13:09.740
Mm-Hmm.

13:09.775 --> 13:10.629
And, um...

13:10.664 --> 13:11.831
it actually makes a lot of

13:11.866 --> 13:12.797
Sense to me.

13:12.832 --> 13:14.128
Ahh.

13:14.163 --> 13:16.346
What makes a lot of sense?

13:16.381 --> 13:18.489
You and me, we have a baby.

13:18.524 --> 13:20.562
That's funny.

13:20.597 --> 13:21.613
Don't laugh. I'm being really

13:21.648 --> 13:22.739
Serious here because it would be

13:22.774 --> 13:23.918
Totally different, OK? There

13:23.953 --> 13:25.158
Would be no obligations, there

13:25.193 --> 13:26.228
Would be no entanglements. I

13:26.263 --> 13:27.129
Would raise this child. You

13:27.164 --> 13:27.961
Could see him whenever you

13:27.996 --> 13:29.613
Wanted to. I wouldn't ask dollar

13:29.648 --> 13:31.230
One for support from you because

13:31.265 --> 13:32.497
I got all that widow money

13:32.532 --> 13:33.714
Sitting in the account

13:33.749 --> 13:34.862
Untouched. I wouldn't need

13:34.897 --> 13:36.063
Anything from you. I would raise

13:36.098 --> 13:37.464
This child. He would graduate

13:37.499 --> 13:39.098
From high school... bing, bang,

13:39.133 --> 13:40.697
Boom. Right into probie school.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.798
Yeah. It be great, but

13:42.833 --> 13:44.829
What if it's a girl?

13:44.864 --> 13:46.163
You didn't think of that, did

13:46.198 --> 13:46.995
You?

13:47.030 --> 13:49.280
Ah, there's these things they

13:49.315 --> 13:51.406
Can do! Um, where they take your

13:51.441 --> 13:53.497
Eggs and they, um, scramble them

13:53.532 --> 13:55.081
And then the boy comes out.

13:55.116 --> 13:56.406
Yeah. OK. I'm not interested

13:56.441 --> 13:58.035
In scrambled eggs, all right?

13:58.070 --> 13:59.550
Hey! Listen to me. Not for

13:59.585 --> 14:01.307
Nothing, but the clock is

14:01.342 --> 14:02.586
A-Ticking for both of us. My

14:02.621 --> 14:03.742
Eggs aren't going to be around

14:03.777 --> 14:05.237
Forever. And whether you want to

14:05.272 --> 14:06.634
Admit it or not, the day's going

14:06.669 --> 14:08.250
To come when you're not going to

14:08.285 --> 14:09.831
Be able to deliver the wigglers.

14:09.866 --> 14:10.931
The wigglers.

14:10.966 --> 14:11.961
You heard me.

14:11.996 --> 14:13.162
Yeah, OK. Well...

14:13.197 --> 14:14.063
all right. Well, so, what are

14:14.098 --> 14:15.362
You gonna do?

14:15.397 --> 14:16.497
I have an appointment at the

14:16.532 --> 14:17.414
Sperm bank tomorrow. They're

14:17.449 --> 14:18.589
Going to take some of my

14:18.624 --> 14:19.560
Wigglers and freeze them, so

14:19.595 --> 14:20.562
Whenever I want to use the

14:20.597 --> 14:22.346
Wigglers, I'll have plenty of

14:22.381 --> 14:24.096
Them to throw around. All right?

14:24.131 --> 14:25.597
Oh, you're so disgusting.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.896
It's practical.

14:26.931 --> 14:28.047
When you want to talk about

14:28.082 --> 14:29.572
Something other than throwing

14:29.607 --> 14:31.063
Your sperm around, why don't you

14:31.098 --> 14:32.495
Call me?

14:32.530 --> 14:34.313
Oh! And by the way, you might

14:34.348 --> 14:36.096
Want to think about being nicer

14:36.131 --> 14:38.197
To black people.

14:41.597 --> 14:43.797
Dude, look.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.864
Power play.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.016
Shit.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.638
Those guys suck, man.

14:50.673 --> 14:52.188
Yeah, tell me about it.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.589
I'm taking off, jer.

15:07.624 --> 15:08.523
Hey, Larry.

15:08.558 --> 15:09.387
Birdie.

15:09.422 --> 15:10.838
Birdie. Not that I mind

15:10.873 --> 15:12.220
Lugging boxes up from the

15:12.255 --> 15:13.788
Basement all night and cleaning

15:13.823 --> 15:15.222
Up the girl puke, but I thought

15:15.257 --> 15:16.456
I was supposed to tend bar.

15:16.491 --> 15:17.773
Yeah, that was the plan, but

15:17.808 --> 15:19.081
We got to wait for some shifts

15:19.116 --> 15:20.369
To open up first. Look, Cindy's

15:20.404 --> 15:21.879
Talking about moving to a joint

15:21.914 --> 15:23.184
Downtown. Right? You pick up her

15:23.219 --> 15:24.404
Shifts, you'll be pulling in

15:24.439 --> 15:25.397
More cash than you can count.

15:25.432 --> 15:26.320
Hey, that's what I want to

15:26.355 --> 15:27.205
Talk to you about. Is there any

15:27.240 --> 15:28.281
Chance of maybe getting paid

15:28.316 --> 15:29.322
Under the table? You know, keep

15:29.357 --> 15:30.320
Uncle sam out of it?

15:30.355 --> 15:31.472
I wish I could, man, but my

15:31.507 --> 15:32.581
Old lady's the accountant. You

15:32.616 --> 15:33.619
Know? If everything's not above

15:33.654 --> 15:34.638
Board, she's going to bust my

15:34.673 --> 15:36.014
Balls more than she usually

15:36.049 --> 15:37.302
Does. Hey, that reminds me. I

15:37.337 --> 15:38.555
Need tax info from you... like

15:38.590 --> 15:39.687
Social, all that stuff.

15:39.722 --> 15:40.772
I can give it you right now.

15:40.807 --> 15:41.787
No, no, just write it down.

15:41.822 --> 15:43.805
I'll get it from you next time I

15:43.840 --> 15:45.789
See you. And good job tonight.

15:53.689 --> 15:55.755
Alicia, can we, um...

15:55.790 --> 15:56.554
can we just...

15:56.589 --> 15:58.388
mm-Hmm. Sure. But I wanted to

15:58.423 --> 16:00.188
Try maybe this little thing that

16:00.223 --> 16:01.455
I do with my tongue that we

16:01.490 --> 16:02.805
Haven't tried before?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.086
What little thing?

16:04.121 --> 16:05.422
Well, it's with my tongue and

16:05.457 --> 16:06.520
My teeth.

16:06.555 --> 16:07.988
It doesn't hurt. No, no, no.

16:08.023 --> 16:09.422
Well, I mean it hurts, but in a

16:09.457 --> 16:11.523
Good way.

16:11.558 --> 16:13.554
Shit.

16:13.589 --> 16:15.088
I can't believe I'm about to say

16:15.123 --> 16:16.406
This.

16:16.441 --> 16:17.654
What?

16:17.689 --> 16:19.956
Can we just, um, talk for a

16:19.991 --> 16:22.555
Second... please?

16:22.590 --> 16:26.887
Sure.

16:26.922 --> 16:29.255
Uh... all right. The thing is,

16:29.290 --> 16:31.589
That, um, this is all just...

16:31.624 --> 16:33.220
you're feeling kind of

16:33.255 --> 16:35.455
Disoriented with the park view

16:35.490 --> 16:37.620
And the silk sheets and the

16:37.655 --> 16:39.305
Girlie soap and everything. It's

16:39.340 --> 16:40.956
A little much when you come from

16:40.991 --> 16:42.120
Nothing, right?

16:42.155 --> 16:44.072
Well, yeah. And also the...

16:44.107 --> 16:45.954
age issue, because even

16:45.989 --> 16:47.389
Though I turn you on and I know

16:47.424 --> 16:48.589
Exactly what you want in bed,

16:48.624 --> 16:49.755
You're still thinking of banging

16:49.790 --> 16:50.587
College girls and you're

16:50.622 --> 16:52.522
Wondering if I know it. I do.

16:52.557 --> 16:54.223
Because, you know, you get to

16:54.258 --> 16:55.889
Know a lot of guys and you start

16:55.924 --> 16:57.555
To recognize patterns.

16:57.590 --> 16:58.754
And I'm...

16:58.789 --> 17:01.322
30 percent man and 60 percent

17:01.357 --> 17:03.189
Boy and maybe 10 percent

17:03.224 --> 17:04.989
Neanderthal. You know, and

17:05.023 --> 17:06.571
That's really not a very good

17:06.607 --> 17:08.121
Recommendation for a long-Term

17:08.156 --> 17:09.088
Relationship...

17:09.123 --> 17:09.532
so?

17:09.568 --> 17:11.150
Because there's a little girl

17:11.185 --> 17:13.175
In the next room who thinks that

17:13.211 --> 17:15.422
You're just the greatest guy

17:15.457 --> 17:17.494
Since Adam and, well, I'm going

17:17.530 --> 17:19.534
To give you the benefit of the

17:19.569 --> 17:21.244
Doubt.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.886
Oh.

17:22.921 --> 17:23.952
You know, you just

17:23.987 --> 17:25.021
Said everything I wanted to say

17:25.056 --> 17:26.755
But better.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.454
Tongue trick?

17:28.490 --> 17:29.922
Sure.

17:29.957 --> 17:31.354
Cool.

17:36.687 --> 17:38.804
I'm not gay.

17:38.839 --> 17:40.886
Neither am I.

17:40.921 --> 17:42.654
I mean, we live together and

17:42.689 --> 17:44.138
Everything, but it's not like we

17:44.173 --> 17:45.587
Sleep together or kiss or any of

17:45.622 --> 17:46.486
That shit.

17:46.521 --> 17:48.204
Yeah. It's just blowjobs. And

17:48.239 --> 17:49.887
They don't count as sex anymore,

17:49.922 --> 17:50.687
So it's not like we're even

17:50.722 --> 17:52.221
Doing anything sexual.

17:52.256 --> 17:53.720
Yeah, and definitely not

17:53.755 --> 17:54.938
Anything gay.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.086
Exactly.

17:56.121 --> 17:58.887
I'm just getting the blowjobs

17:58.922 --> 18:03.486
So I'm really not gay.

18:03.521 --> 18:05.088
Are you saying I'm gayer than

18:05.123 --> 18:05.661
You?

18:05.696 --> 18:06.165
No.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.198
Well, don't piss me off,

18:07.233 --> 18:08.167
Mike. I'll beat your face in,

18:08.202 --> 18:09.299
Asshole.

18:09.334 --> 18:11.667
Dude, if I'm not gay at all,

18:11.702 --> 18:14.001
How can you be gayer than me?

18:14.036 --> 18:17.500
Use your logic, dude.

18:17.535 --> 18:22.832
Sorry, man.

18:22.867 --> 18:24.334
So, you think you'll ever

18:24.369 --> 18:26.634
Want to try it?

18:26.669 --> 18:28.299
Try what?

18:28.334 --> 18:30.467
Going down on me.

18:30.502 --> 18:33.518
No, dude. Never.

18:33.553 --> 18:36.499
That's cool.

18:36.534 --> 18:38.534
Don't forget the old expression,

18:38.569 --> 18:41.151
Though. Never say never.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.734
No. I'm saying never. Loud

18:43.769 --> 18:44.866
And clear.

18:44.901 --> 18:46.001
Why do you have to be a dick?

18:46.036 --> 18:47.299
Shut up.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.134
You shut up!

18:48.169 --> 18:48.901
You shut up!

18:48.936 --> 18:49.701
You shut up!

18:49.736 --> 18:50.467
You shut up!

19:00.233 --> 19:02.132
Yeah?

19:02.167 --> 19:04.267
Hey, it's me. Hello?

19:04.302 --> 19:05.499
Yeah.

19:05.534 --> 19:07.000
Look, I hate to say this, but

19:07.035 --> 19:08.717
I think we need to get together

19:08.752 --> 19:10.376
And talk. I've been talking to

19:10.411 --> 19:11.739
Lawyers and crunching numbers,

19:11.774 --> 19:13.068
And if I hire a lawyer to handle

19:13.103 --> 19:14.868
Things, there won't be any

19:14.903 --> 19:16.235
Numbers left to crunch. So, as

19:16.270 --> 19:17.402
Much as I would love to screw

19:17.437 --> 19:18.735
You to the wall and leave you

19:18.770 --> 19:20.034
Penniless, it doesn't look like

19:20.069 --> 19:20.901
That'll be happening.

19:21.734 --> 19:23.100
Hang on a second, OK?

19:23.135 --> 19:24.532
Hello?

19:24.567 --> 19:25.534
What do you want?

19:25.569 --> 19:26.499
Mags?

19:26.534 --> 19:27.667
You called me last night?

19:27.702 --> 19:28.801
Yes. I wanted to talk to you

19:28.836 --> 19:29.933
About Sean.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.851
John? I'm not getting into

19:31.886 --> 19:33.193
The middle of that bullshit.

19:33.228 --> 19:34.464
The two of you are a bunch of

19:34.499 --> 19:35.650
Idiots as far as I'm concerned.

19:35.685 --> 19:37.209
I'm talking about Garrity.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.805
Sean Garrity. Your boyfriend.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.367
Who said he was my boyfriend?

19:40.402 --> 19:41.265
He did.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.632
What a tool.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.566
You gonna buy that?

19:43.601 --> 19:44.817
No. I'm going to read this,

19:44.852 --> 19:46.034
And when I'm done reading this,

19:46.069 --> 19:47.168
I'm going to walk away.

19:47.203 --> 19:49.235
God, people are so rude.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.232
Hang on a second, mag.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.517
All right. Look, I can't talk

19:52.552 --> 19:53.767
Right now. When do you want to

19:53.802 --> 19:54.532
Meet?

19:54.567 --> 19:56.033
Well, how's Tuesday at 4:00?

19:56.068 --> 19:57.634
I'll make sure that the girls

19:57.669 --> 19:59.200
Aren't here. Colleen has bible

19:59.235 --> 20:00.400
Study, and I'll set up a

20:00.435 --> 20:01.532
Play date for katy.

20:01.567 --> 20:02.232
All right. Let me tell you

20:02.267 --> 20:03.900
One thing right now... if I even

20:03.935 --> 20:05.534
Smell Johnny within two blocks

20:05.569 --> 20:06.551
Of that house...

20:06.586 --> 20:07.499
he won't be.

20:07.534 --> 20:08.634
Tuesday at 4:00.

20:08.669 --> 20:10.818
Got to go.

20:10.853 --> 20:12.933
Yeah?

20:12.968 --> 20:14.834
He's not my boyfriend.

20:14.869 --> 20:16.484
Well, he thinks he is.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.065
Listen, Tom, he's a sweet

20:18.100 --> 20:19.750
Kid. Dumb as a box of rocks and

20:19.785 --> 20:21.492
Not the regular ones. The dumb

20:21.527 --> 20:22.897
Ones. He's not bad in the Sack,

20:22.932 --> 20:24.267
But that's about all there is to

20:24.302 --> 20:25.033
It.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.400
So, you're not serious

20:26.435 --> 20:27.098
About him?

20:27.133 --> 20:27.933
Listen, Tommy, including

20:27.968 --> 20:29.751
Garrity, I got four guys in line

20:29.786 --> 20:31.176
Right now. No... five. I just

20:31.211 --> 20:32.489
Started a thing with the new

20:32.524 --> 20:33.732
Super in my building. Cute

20:33.767 --> 20:35.734
Mexican guy. His name is nacho.

20:35.769 --> 20:36.768
You know, like the snack.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.668
Yeah. That's cute. He's in

20:37.703 --> 20:38.534
Love with you, you know.

20:38.569 --> 20:39.365
Nacho?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.098
Not nacho! Garrity!

20:41.133 --> 20:41.999
Tell me something I don't

20:42.034 --> 20:43.367
Know. They're all in love with

20:43.402 --> 20:44.701
Me, Tom. It's like moths to a

20:44.736 --> 20:46.666
Flame. Am I bad?

20:46.701 --> 20:47.667
You know, I'm just glad to

20:47.702 --> 20:48.634
Hear that you're not serious

20:48.669 --> 20:50.668
About him, you know?

20:50.703 --> 20:52.632
What are you doing?

20:52.667 --> 20:54.100
Calm down, punjab. I'll give

20:54.135 --> 20:56.167
You a nickel. God.

20:56.202 --> 20:57.334
Bye.

20:58.334 --> 20:59.165
Yeah?

20:59.200 --> 21:00.933
Hi. It's me. Look, I just

21:00.968 --> 21:02.667
Wanted to say I'm sorry about

21:02.702 --> 21:03.566
Last night.

21:03.601 --> 21:04.968
Boy, it's crazy chick calling

21:05.003 --> 21:05.868
Day, isn't it?

21:05.903 --> 21:06.699
What did you say?

21:06.734 --> 21:08.184
Nothing. What do you want?

21:08.219 --> 21:09.476
Listen, have you gone and

21:09.511 --> 21:10.699
Done the sperm thing yet?

21:10.734 --> 21:13.084
I'm on my way right now. Why?

21:13.119 --> 21:15.434
How do they... remove it from

21:15.469 --> 21:16.232
You?

21:16.267 --> 21:17.450
The sperm? You know, I think

21:17.485 --> 21:18.909
They go in above the knee with a

21:18.944 --> 21:20.205
Little tube and they suck the

21:20.240 --> 21:21.387
Cum right out of your leg. I

21:21.422 --> 21:22.878
Don't... what do you think?

21:22.913 --> 21:24.334
I mean, do they... hook you up

21:24.369 --> 21:25.832
To some device or...

21:25.867 --> 21:27.683
they have a penis pump. No. I

21:27.718 --> 21:29.893
Jerk off, OK? I jerk off into a

21:29.928 --> 21:31.580
Cup or, you know, a plastic ice

21:31.615 --> 21:33.233
Cube tray or something. I don't

21:33.268 --> 21:34.198
Know. Why?

21:34.233 --> 21:35.034
All right, all right. That's

21:35.069 --> 21:35.767
What I thought.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.033
Hang on. Yeah?

21:38.068 --> 21:39.467
Hi. Mr. Gavin. It's your

21:39.502 --> 21:40.332
Favorite teacher.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.133
It really is crazy chick

21:42.168 --> 21:42.966
Calling day.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.284
I need to see you right now.

21:45.319 --> 21:47.532
I'm sorry, but I can't see

21:47.567 --> 21:49.000
You. I'm on my way to a doctor's

21:49.035 --> 21:50.434
Appointment, all right? So...

21:50.469 --> 21:52.018
it's nothing serious or

21:52.053 --> 21:53.532
Transmittable, I hope.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.634
Well, it's just a... a bunch of

21:55.669 --> 21:57.268
Normal, general check-Up things,

21:57.303 --> 21:58.901
But it's going to be like a few

21:58.936 --> 22:00.500
Hours. I'm very, very busy.

22:00.535 --> 22:01.299
I thought we had an

22:01.334 --> 22:03.233
Arrangement. You know, if you

22:03.268 --> 22:05.133
Don't come over, I'm gonna have

22:05.168 --> 22:06.167
To call Damian.

22:06.202 --> 22:07.832
Oh, God.

22:07.867 --> 22:09.800
All right. I might be able to

22:09.835 --> 22:11.268
Swing by your place. I'm kind of

22:11.303 --> 22:12.701
In your neighborhood. But I can

22:12.736 --> 22:13.801
Only stay 10 minutes.

22:13.836 --> 22:15.118
I'll be waiting.

22:15.153 --> 22:17.210
Don't be tardy.

22:17.245 --> 22:19.232
Ohh. What?

22:19.267 --> 22:20.165
Green light, jackass!

22:20.200 --> 22:21.450
You know, it's against the

22:21.485 --> 22:22.626
Law to drive and talk on your

22:22.661 --> 22:23.767
Cell phone in new York city? You

22:23.802 --> 22:24.432
Know that, right?

22:24.467 --> 22:25.750
Yes, I do. I know that. Look,

22:25.785 --> 22:27.034
I just have a little tiny

22:27.069 --> 22:27.734
Question for you.

22:27.769 --> 22:28.465
What?

22:28.500 --> 22:29.983
When you're at the sperm bank

22:30.018 --> 22:33.026
And you are jerking off into a

22:33.061 --> 22:36.034
Cup, could you think of me?

22:36.069 --> 22:37.732
Why?

22:37.767 --> 22:39.234
Because then if we decide to

22:39.269 --> 22:40.551
Use the sperm at a later date to

22:40.586 --> 22:42.409
Have a child together, then it

22:42.444 --> 22:45.288
Would sort of be like we were

22:45.323 --> 22:48.133
Actually connected at the moment

22:48.168 --> 22:49.867
That it all started.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.818
Hee hee hee.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.734
Think of me!

22:54.767 --> 22:56.132
Hey!

22:56.167 --> 22:57.334
Hey, keela, brush your teeth.

22:57.369 --> 22:58.434
Make that bed up there!

22:58.469 --> 22:59.465
No, you don't have to make

22:59.500 --> 23:00.667
The bed. Mariana will do it. And

23:00.702 --> 23:01.834
Leave the dishes, too. She'll

23:01.869 --> 23:02.634
Take care of that.

23:02.669 --> 23:03.832
OK.

23:03.867 --> 23:07.001
You know, I am so in love

23:07.036 --> 23:09.566
With your daughter.

23:09.601 --> 23:11.300
Did you hear what she said to

23:11.335 --> 23:12.734
Me? I was so moved.

23:12.769 --> 23:14.098
Yeah, well, she asks

23:14.133 --> 23:17.534
Everybody to be her mommy, so...

23:17.569 --> 23:18.799
OK.

23:18.834 --> 23:21.699
I'm sorry... alicia. I didn't

23:21.734 --> 23:23.801
Mean that. She... she really likes

23:23.836 --> 23:25.632
You. She does.

23:25.667 --> 23:26.499
You know, you seem like

23:26.534 --> 23:28.133
You've been a dad forever. I'm

23:28.168 --> 23:29.098
So impressed.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.098
Yeah. Well, don't be too

23:30.133 --> 23:31.850
Impressed. Yeah, I freaked out,

23:31.885 --> 23:33.567
You know. I couldn't handle it.

23:33.602 --> 23:35.034
I put her up for adoption.

23:35.069 --> 23:35.966
What?

23:36.001 --> 23:37.265
Yeah. She got placed with

23:37.300 --> 23:38.766
This family... these pigs... you

23:38.801 --> 23:39.917
Know, all they cared about what

23:39.952 --> 23:41.034
Was their monthly check from the

23:41.069 --> 23:41.799
State.

23:41.834 --> 23:42.532
Oh, my God.

23:42.567 --> 23:43.950
Yeah. I was out of my mind.

23:43.985 --> 23:45.076
So I... stole her back.

23:45.111 --> 23:46.167
What do you mean you stole

23:46.202 --> 23:47.033
Her?

23:47.068 --> 23:47.984
I just took her.

23:48.019 --> 23:48.866
You took her?

23:48.901 --> 23:49.832
Yeah. You know, people like

23:49.867 --> 23:50.884
That are never going to call the

23:50.919 --> 23:52.043
Cops. They still get their check

23:52.078 --> 23:53.167
Every month. No extra mouth to

23:53.202 --> 23:54.632
Feed so they're thrilled.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.034
But, um, that's just between you

23:57.069 --> 24:00.332
And me. OK?

24:00.367 --> 24:02.001
I think you're going to have

24:02.036 --> 24:03.399
To seal my lips.

24:03.434 --> 24:04.467
I was just thinking the same

24:04.502 --> 24:05.834
Thing.

24:10.968 --> 24:12.267
Keela, come on, sweetheart.

24:12.302 --> 24:13.334
We're late.

24:14.068 --> 24:14.999
Oh, my God.

24:15.034 --> 24:16.666
You're a bad, bad boy.

24:16.701 --> 24:19.667
Oh, Mrs. Turbody. Mmm! Mmm!

24:19.702 --> 24:21.566
Mrs. Turbody! Ohh!

24:21.601 --> 24:23.867
Ohh! Ohh! Mrs. Turbody!

24:23.902 --> 24:27.718
Ohh! Ohh!

24:27.753 --> 24:30.310
Ohh, ohh.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.406
Sorry.

24:33.441 --> 24:36.432
It's OK.

24:36.467 --> 24:38.233
So, you'll be in here.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.699
OK.

24:39.734 --> 24:40.784
Take as long as you need,

24:40.819 --> 24:42.109
And then when you have your

24:42.144 --> 24:43.400
Deposit, bring it to the front

24:43.435 --> 24:44.534
And carl will catalog it.

24:44.569 --> 24:48.532
OK. Carl.

24:48.567 --> 24:49.834
A little chilly in here, isn't

24:49.869 --> 24:50.699
It?

24:50.734 --> 24:53.299
I'll turn the heat up.

24:53.334 --> 24:54.934
We have some reading material

24:54.969 --> 24:56.534
There if you need inspiration.

24:56.569 --> 24:58.668
<i>Thisis... playboys.</i>

24:58.703 --> 25:00.732
<i>Old playboys.</i>

25:00.767 --> 25:02.267
Don't you have anything a little

25:02.302 --> 25:04.284
More, you know...

25:04.319 --> 25:06.232
I don't understand.

25:06.267 --> 25:08.267
Something a little more...

25:08.302 --> 25:10.999
more... what?

25:11.034 --> 25:15.701
This will be fine. Ahem.

25:19.867 --> 25:22.334
All right. Pal. Let's get

25:22.369 --> 25:23.334
Going.

25:27.601 --> 25:29.499
Hey, uh...

25:29.534 --> 25:31.534
it's carl, right?

25:31.569 --> 25:32.465
Yes.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.332
Um... ahem. I, uh...

25:35.367 --> 25:36.900
I stopped and had sex on my way

25:36.935 --> 25:38.368
Over here so, um, I just wanted

25:38.403 --> 25:39.801
To let you know that, uh, this

25:39.836 --> 25:41.635
Isn't my normal volume...

25:41.670 --> 25:43.268
you know, sperm-Wise.

25:43.303 --> 25:46.201
I'm sure it's fine.

25:46.236 --> 25:49.100
Well, it's just...

25:49.135 --> 25:52.034
how ya doing?

25:52.069 --> 25:53.566
Uh...

25:53.601 --> 25:55.101
it's also the cups are kinda big

25:55.136 --> 25:57.102
So it just seems like there's,

25:57.137 --> 25:59.068
You know, not that much in

25:59.103 --> 25:59.766
There.

25:59.801 --> 26:00.534
I can take your

26:00.569 --> 26:01.384
Deposit now.

26:01.419 --> 26:02.165
'Cause I was

26:02.200 --> 26:03.150
Thinking if you'd give me a new

26:03.185 --> 26:04.100
Cup, I could go home and, you

26:04.135 --> 26:06.132
Know, take care of my

26:06.167 --> 26:07.100
Business there and put it in the

26:07.135 --> 26:08.034
Fridge and bring it in first

26:08.069 --> 26:08.701
Thing in the morning.

26:08.736 --> 26:09.899
No?

26:09.934 --> 26:11.667
No. We need to make sure that

26:11.702 --> 26:13.400
Your, uh, deposit is fresh

26:13.435 --> 26:15.365
Before we freeze it.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.968
Don't worry. Everyone thinks

26:17.003 --> 26:18.051
It's not enough.

26:18.086 --> 26:19.065
Oh, really?

26:19.100 --> 26:20.300
Yeah. I'm sure it's a

26:20.335 --> 26:21.500
Perfectly normal amount.

26:21.535 --> 26:22.832
Thank you.

26:22.867 --> 26:25.767
Yeah... this is really not

26:25.802 --> 26:27.367
Enough.

26:28.534 --> 26:31.567
Can you come back tomorrow?

26:31.602 --> 26:33.499
Yeah.

26:33.534 --> 26:35.267
I just want to point out that

26:35.302 --> 26:38.501
It's really cold in that room

26:38.536 --> 26:41.701
And you could use smaller cups

26:41.736 --> 26:43.701
And better magazines.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.937
What's going on?

26:55.972 --> 26:57.805
Hmm? Ah, nothing, man.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.604
Wow. Look at him, huh?

26:59.639 --> 27:02.088
Yeah, he's dead to the world.

27:02.123 --> 27:04.538
Yeah, that's good eating.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.470
Goddamn pricks!

27:22.505 --> 27:25.039
It's not funny! God damn it!

27:25.074 --> 27:27.223
It's not!

27:27.258 --> 27:29.338
Ohh!

27:29.373 --> 27:30.538
Now that's funny!

27:36.872 --> 27:38.288
Yo. Lou, boy, did you pick

27:38.323 --> 27:39.731
The wrong day to show up late

27:39.766 --> 27:41.019
To work, my man. Chief was

27:41.054 --> 27:42.273
Sleeping in the break room, me

27:42.308 --> 27:42.937
And Tommy...

27:42.972 --> 27:43.904
yeah. You know, I heard.

27:43.939 --> 27:44.855
There's pieces of lounger up and

27:44.890 --> 27:45.797
Down the street. You know, you

27:45.832 --> 27:46.885
Could have gotten somebody

27:46.920 --> 27:47.979
Killed. Goddamn bunch of

27:48.014 --> 27:49.004
Juvenile delinquents.

27:49.039 --> 27:50.906
Yo, Lou, you need a hug or

27:50.941 --> 27:52.338
Something?

27:52.373 --> 27:53.971
Lighten up, buddy.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.489
Hey, is that a nicotine patch

27:55.524 --> 27:56.898
I see? It's against the rules,

27:56.933 --> 27:58.103
My man. I think you got to make

27:58.138 --> 27:59.273
A little cash deposit in the

27:59.308 --> 27:59.904
Kitty.

27:59.939 --> 28:00.789
You know, why don't you mind

28:00.824 --> 28:01.639
Your own business, you stupid

28:01.674 --> 28:02.437
Spic?

28:02.472 --> 28:04.138
Excuse me?

28:04.173 --> 28:05.770
You heard me.

28:05.805 --> 28:07.988
Yeah. I heard you and I saw

28:08.023 --> 28:10.137
You. Drunk off your ass the

28:10.172 --> 28:11.222
Other night, stumbling around in

28:11.257 --> 28:13.148
The street like some goddamn

28:13.183 --> 28:14.511
Bum. Maybe I'm a stupid spic,

28:14.546 --> 28:15.839
Lou, but at least I've got my

28:15.874 --> 28:16.839
Personal shit together.

28:23.672 --> 28:25.939
Ahem. What's going on?

28:25.974 --> 28:27.971
Shh.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.672
Quiet time.

28:38.839 --> 28:40.071
Bullshit.

28:40.106 --> 28:41.122
Yeah, OK. You know what? I'm

28:41.157 --> 28:42.314
Not getting involved. I'm just

28:42.349 --> 28:43.527
Relaying information here, OK?

28:43.562 --> 28:44.705
What, four other guys? Come

28:44.740 --> 28:45.537
On, that's crazy.

28:45.572 --> 28:46.470
Yeah. Crazy to you and me,

28:46.505 --> 28:47.839
But to a crazy person... business

28:47.874 --> 28:49.072
As usual. All right?

28:49.107 --> 28:49.871
What?

28:49.906 --> 28:52.171
Hey, look, the bear, the

28:52.206 --> 28:53.305
Stick? Does that ring a bell?

28:53.340 --> 28:54.339
You know, if she were dating

28:54.374 --> 28:55.339
Four other guys, I'd think I'd

28:55.374 --> 28:56.389
Know about it, OK?

28:56.424 --> 28:57.370
How would you know?

28:57.405 --> 28:58.737
I don't know. Maybe there'd

28:58.772 --> 29:00.139
Be some other guys' underwear or

29:00.174 --> 29:00.823
Socks laying around?

29:00.858 --> 29:01.472
Underwear and socks?

29:01.507 --> 29:02.104
Yeah.

29:02.139 --> 29:02.955
Yeah, you go with that plan.

29:02.990 --> 29:03.772
Do yourself a favor. Walk away

29:03.807 --> 29:04.437
From the relationship.

29:04.472 --> 29:05.889
You know what, Tom? This is

29:05.924 --> 29:07.031
You just being you. You know,

29:07.066 --> 29:08.139
Overprotective and not thinking

29:08.174 --> 29:08.939
I'm good enough for your

29:08.974 --> 29:09.604
Sister.

29:09.639 --> 29:10.289
That is not the

29:10.324 --> 29:10.939
Issue, believe me.

29:10.974 --> 29:11.604
Yes, it is.

29:11.639 --> 29:12.472
Of course you're good enough

29:12.507 --> 29:13.156
For her.

29:13.191 --> 29:13.770
Oh, really?

29:13.805 --> 29:14.638
So were the four other guys...

29:14.673 --> 29:15.473
the underwear and the sock guys.

29:15.508 --> 29:16.223
Very funny. You know, don't

29:16.258 --> 29:17.015
Talk about her that way.

29:17.050 --> 29:17.827
Don't put your hands on me.

29:17.862 --> 29:18.605
Don't put your hands on me,

29:18.640 --> 29:19.656
You jerk.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.181
Lay off!

29:21.216 --> 29:22.637
Bitch!

29:22.672 --> 29:23.904
My sister!

29:23.939 --> 29:25.889
She's my girlfriend.

29:25.924 --> 29:27.839
Yeah. One other thing,

29:27.874 --> 29:29.023
Asshole.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.137
What?

29:30.172 --> 29:32.205
Don't tell her I mentioned

29:32.240 --> 29:34.239
This stuff to you, all right?

29:34.274 --> 29:36.140
Please?

29:36.175 --> 29:38.006
Sean?

29:41.472 --> 29:42.805
Hey, you work in there?

29:42.840 --> 29:43.470
Huh?

29:43.505 --> 29:44.872
You a fireman?

29:44.907 --> 29:47.604
Yeah.

29:47.639 --> 29:49.505
That's from the neighborhood.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.273
Come on! Yeah!

30:00.308 --> 30:02.440
Ohh!

30:02.475 --> 30:04.223
Cup?

30:04.258 --> 30:05.898
Ah! No!

30:05.933 --> 30:08.486
Aah!

30:08.521 --> 30:10.397
Shit!

30:10.432 --> 30:12.238
And?

30:12.273 --> 30:13.204
Actually, we just ran your

30:13.239 --> 30:15.489
Semen under the scope... standard

30:15.524 --> 30:17.715
Procedure... we've never seen this

30:17.750 --> 30:19.906
Before... seems to be quite a bit

30:19.941 --> 30:22.104
Of dust in it.

30:22.139 --> 30:25.538
It's been a long time. Ahem.

30:29.739 --> 30:30.739
See you tomorrow.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.016
Ah!

30:53.051 --> 30:54.132
Uh!

31:34.866 --> 31:36.431
Hey!

31:36.466 --> 31:38.833
What do you think you're doing?

31:38.868 --> 31:40.117
Who the hell are you?

31:40.152 --> 31:41.259
What are you doing?

31:41.294 --> 31:42.331
I'm frying myself!

31:42.366 --> 31:44.366
That's what I'm doing. Get

31:44.401 --> 31:45.297
Out of here.

31:45.332 --> 31:46.900
It's a free country. We can

31:46.935 --> 31:47.598
Both do it.

31:47.633 --> 31:49.149
No way. People will read

31:49.184 --> 31:50.666
About this in the paper!

31:50.701 --> 31:51.364
They'll think we're

31:51.399 --> 31:52.766
Cult members or a couple of

31:52.801 --> 31:54.130
Queers with some homo

31:54.165 --> 31:56.599
Suicide pact thing. Take a hike,

31:56.634 --> 31:57.364
Wannabe!

31:57.399 --> 31:58.899
You hake a tike.

31:58.934 --> 32:00.900
I was here first.

32:00.935 --> 32:02.831
I'm going first!

32:02.866 --> 32:04.464
Why should you go first?

32:04.499 --> 32:07.332
I'm homeless! I got nothing!

32:07.367 --> 32:09.833
I got no friends, I got no

32:09.868 --> 32:11.583
Family. My life is shit, man!

32:11.618 --> 32:13.299
My life is bigger shit, all

32:13.334 --> 32:14.764
Right?

32:14.799 --> 32:17.649
My wife, whom I love dearly,

32:17.684 --> 32:19.924
Left me for another man. She

32:19.959 --> 32:21.929
Broke my heart and then she took

32:21.964 --> 32:23.900
Nearly everything that I owned,

32:23.935 --> 32:25.965
All right? And then I met

32:26.000 --> 32:28.766
Another woman. Yeah. Beautiful.

32:28.801 --> 32:31.200
Young, gorgeous hooker, but one

32:31.235 --> 32:33.333
Of the good ones because she

32:33.368 --> 32:35.233
Didn't make me pay until the

32:35.268 --> 32:37.050
End. And at the end she took

32:37.085 --> 32:39.542
Every penny that I had on earth.

32:39.577 --> 32:41.755
And then... get this. I'm in a

32:41.790 --> 32:43.461
Porn store the other day, and

32:43.496 --> 32:46.797
Who do I see on the cover of a

32:46.832 --> 32:50.299
Triple x but her. So, not only

32:50.334 --> 32:53.916
Is she a thief and a hooker, but

32:53.951 --> 32:57.191
She's a porn star to boot. I'm a

32:57.226 --> 33:00.432
Joke. I'm a loser. I look in the

33:00.467 --> 33:02.032
Mirror, I want to puke.

33:08.799 --> 33:11.999
Be my guest.

33:12.034 --> 33:15.164
Excuse me?

33:15.199 --> 33:19.933
You win, loser. You go first.

33:19.968 --> 33:21.332
Thanks.

34:11.533 --> 34:12.598
Who is it?

34:12.632 --> 34:17.533
It's Lou. Open up.

34:17.568 --> 34:18.797
Hey.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.833
What's going on? It's like

34:20.868 --> 34:22.317
4:00 in the morning.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.626
I know. Did I wake you?

34:24.661 --> 34:26.900
I was up anyways. What's

34:26.935 --> 34:27.797
Happened?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.733
I need some help.

34:29.768 --> 34:30.864
Everything?

34:30.900 --> 34:33.333
Every cent I had. I know what

34:33.368 --> 34:35.833
You're thinking. I'm a moron.

34:35.868 --> 34:37.817
At this advanced age, I mean, I

34:37.851 --> 34:40.092
Can't believe I didn't see it

34:40.127 --> 34:42.663
Coming. Maybe I did. I don't

34:42.697 --> 34:45.181
Even know anymore. A gorgeous

34:45.217 --> 34:48.257
Girl like that, Tommy, she was

34:48.293 --> 34:50.312
So gorgeous. What would she ever

34:50.347 --> 34:52.331
Want with a guy like me, I don't

34:52.367 --> 34:54.349
Know.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.297
Well...

34:56.331 --> 34:58.616
look at the bright side. I mean,

34:58.651 --> 35:00.642
At least you got to bang a porn

35:00.677 --> 35:02.488
Chick for a couple of months.

35:02.523 --> 35:04.264
I know. I just found out

35:04.299 --> 35:06.900
Recently. It didn't really help.

35:06.935 --> 35:09.464
Well, you know what, pal.

35:09.499 --> 35:11.732
Ahem. I'd do anything I can to

35:11.767 --> 35:13.966
Help you. I'm kind of strapped

35:14.001 --> 35:14.997
For cash right now.

35:15.032 --> 35:16.064
I'm just wondering if I

35:16.099 --> 35:17.499
Can maybe just crash here for a

35:17.534 --> 35:18.865
Little while, you know. I'm

35:18.900 --> 35:20.916
Living in this shithole basement

35:20.951 --> 35:22.675
Apartment with a jihad going on

35:22.710 --> 35:24.399
Upstairs 24/7. I can't go back

35:24.434 --> 35:25.564
There.

35:25.599 --> 35:26.397
You can take the master

35:26.432 --> 35:27.366
Bedroom. I haven't been able to

35:27.401 --> 35:28.266
Sleep in it since she left

35:28.301 --> 35:29.397
Anyways.

35:29.432 --> 35:32.332
I just need...

35:32.367 --> 35:34.650
to rest. You know?

35:34.685 --> 35:36.792
Clear my head.

35:36.827 --> 35:38.946
All right.

35:38.981 --> 35:41.030
You got it.

35:41.065 --> 35:43.198
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

35:43.233 --> 35:44.949
That means, you know...

35:44.984 --> 35:46.666
I know what it means, Tom.

35:52.466 --> 35:55.949
Lou, um...

35:55.984 --> 35:59.397
seriously...

35:59.432 --> 36:01.166
if you're gonna be crying,

36:01.201 --> 36:02.883
You're gonna have to go.

36:02.918 --> 36:04.566
Oh, God. You're such an

36:04.601 --> 36:05.717
Asshole.

36:05.752 --> 36:06.833
Goodnight.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.449
Is he there?

36:20.484 --> 36:22.991
He's there.

36:23.026 --> 36:25.499
All right.

36:29.266 --> 36:31.166
Donaghy's. Pete speaking.

36:31.201 --> 36:32.164
It's Tom.

36:32.199 --> 36:33.431
Hey, Tom. How's things?

36:33.466 --> 36:35.149
It's great. You got his gun?

36:35.184 --> 36:36.925
Got it. Hey, what's up with

36:36.960 --> 36:38.666
Blowing off those black folks

36:38.701 --> 36:39.364
Uptown?

36:39.399 --> 36:40.830
First of all, there was an

36:40.865 --> 36:42.048
Egyptian kid stuck in that bus,

36:42.083 --> 36:44.174
OK? And he was blacker than

36:44.209 --> 36:46.266
Derek jeter. Put him on.

36:46.301 --> 36:47.750
Asshole?

36:47.785 --> 36:49.164
Dick face.

36:49.199 --> 36:50.199
30 minutes, you're going to

36:50.234 --> 36:51.099
Be there, right?

36:51.134 --> 36:51.753
Uh-Huh.

36:51.788 --> 36:52.853
How ya doing?

36:52.888 --> 36:55.137
Not too bad. Couple of broken

36:55.172 --> 36:57.387
Ribs, busted tooth, piece of

36:57.422 --> 36:58.153
Cake.

36:58.188 --> 36:59.171
It's too bad. I was kinda

36:59.206 --> 37:00.155
Hoping it would be worse.

37:00.190 --> 37:01.053
Screw you, Tommy.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.287
30 minutes, you're in, you're

37:03.322 --> 37:04.453
Out. No bullshit.

37:04.488 --> 37:06.287
Yeah. Like it was my idea to

37:06.322 --> 37:08.371
Do this.

37:08.406 --> 37:10.386
Shithead.

37:10.421 --> 37:12.686
Let me ask you something.

37:12.721 --> 37:13.987
When did it start? Was it after

37:14.022 --> 37:15.938
Connor died and I asked you

37:15.973 --> 37:18.497
Personally as my brother to

37:18.532 --> 37:20.393
Look after my own kids and my

37:20.428 --> 37:22.258
Wife? Is that when it started,

37:22.293 --> 37:24.407
Huh? Was it like a month? Couple

37:24.442 --> 37:26.521
Of months? Last week? When did

37:26.556 --> 37:28.020
It start?

37:28.055 --> 37:29.938
It was your Junior prom. When

37:29.973 --> 37:31.447
You brought Janet home so mom

37:31.482 --> 37:33.302
And dad could take pictures

37:33.337 --> 37:35.122
Of her. She looked amazing in

37:35.157 --> 37:36.621
That dress, Tommy.

37:48.855 --> 37:50.021
Drive safe.

37:50.056 --> 37:51.188
Yeah, right.

37:57.055 --> 37:58.288
Look, I think that we should

37:58.323 --> 37:59.422
Just go back to the terms that

37:59.457 --> 38:00.772
We had before when we spoke with

38:00.807 --> 38:02.414
Eddie. OK? So you wanted the

38:02.449 --> 38:05.152
Plasma, which is fine, but I

38:05.187 --> 38:07.855
Would like the chaise lounge.

38:07.890 --> 38:09.622
Hello?

38:09.657 --> 38:11.319
What?

38:11.354 --> 38:13.154
The chaise lounge. It's the

38:13.189 --> 38:14.538
Chair that matches the couch.

38:14.573 --> 38:15.814
You always said that you hated

38:15.849 --> 38:17.018
It because it was too long to

38:17.053 --> 38:18.188
Sit down on and too short to...

38:18.223 --> 38:20.519
yeah, yeah. It's fine.

38:20.554 --> 38:21.687
And I'm concerned about the

38:21.722 --> 38:23.054
School that colleen's in...

38:23.089 --> 38:24.455
this born again thing has me

38:24.490 --> 38:25.888
Really rattled so I thought I

38:25.923 --> 38:27.588
Might look at private schools,

38:27.623 --> 38:29.339
For which case I'm going to need

38:29.374 --> 38:31.081
A lot more money, but Johnny has

38:31.116 --> 38:32.701
Agreed to take care of it, but I

38:32.736 --> 38:35.395
Was hoping that if I needed any

38:35.430 --> 38:38.055
Extra, that I could come to you.

38:38.090 --> 38:39.953
Yeah.

38:39.988 --> 38:41.953
Are we having an actual

38:41.988 --> 38:43.137
Conversation here or is it me

38:43.172 --> 38:44.229
Just talking and you nodding

38:44.264 --> 38:45.287
Your head at everything that I

38:45.322 --> 38:46.553
Say?

38:46.588 --> 38:51.519
A little bit of both.

38:51.554 --> 38:54.321
You are not going to bait me.

38:54.356 --> 38:56.572
OK. The dining room set. I had

38:56.607 --> 38:58.264
Wanted it, but then I found this

38:58.299 --> 39:00.610
One and I like it, so I'll let

39:00.645 --> 39:02.921
You have the other one. There's

39:02.956 --> 39:04.986
A watercolor that's in the

39:05.021 --> 39:06.671
Bedroom that was a gift from my

39:06.706 --> 39:08.914
Parents, so obviously that's

39:08.949 --> 39:10.952
Mine, and I was hoping that

39:10.987 --> 39:12.920
You could work out some

39:12.955 --> 39:14.905
Sort of monthly amount of money

39:14.940 --> 39:16.855
For you to help me with the

39:16.890 --> 39:20.553
Girls.

39:20.588 --> 39:23.886
So, ahem. Let me get this

39:23.921 --> 39:26.004
Straight. You're going to let me

39:26.039 --> 39:29.180
Have the dining room table that

39:29.215 --> 39:31.951
I bought with the money I earned

39:31.986 --> 39:34.353
Running into burning buildings

39:34.388 --> 39:36.271
While other people are running

39:36.306 --> 39:38.155
Out of them. Is that correct?

39:38.190 --> 39:39.386
Yeah.

39:39.421 --> 39:41.187
Hey, Tommy!

39:41.222 --> 39:44.855
What the hell are you doing?

39:44.890 --> 39:47.252
Hey!

39:47.287 --> 39:48.688
God, does this make you feel

39:48.723 --> 39:50.222
More like a man! Huh?

39:50.257 --> 39:54.519
Uhh!

39:54.554 --> 39:57.621
Ohh! Ah!

39:57.656 --> 39:59.988
Ah!

40:00.023 --> 40:02.321
Aah!

41:16.222 --> 41:17.888
Ah.

41:36.921 --> 41:39.137
Sorry about the shirt.

41:39.172 --> 41:41.354
It wasn't one of my

41:41.389 --> 41:45.352
Favorites.

41:45.387 --> 41:47.321
So you're OK about the chaise

41:47.356 --> 41:48.653
Lounge?

41:48.688 --> 41:50.638
Yeah, I'll have a couple of

41:50.673 --> 41:52.588
Guys pick it up and bring it

41:52.623 --> 41:54.822
Over.

41:54.857 --> 41:56.986
Thanks.

41:57.021 --> 41:59.619
If I know my brother,

41:59.654 --> 42:02.321
He's only a couple minutes away.

42:02.356 --> 42:04.988
Probably with the gumball on the

42:05.023 --> 42:08.519
Roof, so, I, uh...

42:08.554 --> 42:12.421
you want me to call you or...

42:12.456 --> 42:14.519
no, um...

42:14.554 --> 42:16.688
I'll call you.

42:27.888 --> 42:29.554
* a very good friend of mine

42:29.589 --> 42:31.120
Said, son, dance to the

42:31.155 --> 42:34.204
Moonshine, dance to the dawn,

42:34.239 --> 42:37.219
Me and the boy had some fun

42:37.254 --> 42:38.755
When we danced to the moonshine,

42:38.790 --> 42:42.386
Danced to the dawn,

42:42.421 --> 42:43.688
And now that all of that

42:43.723 --> 42:44.853
Killing's done,

42:44.888 --> 42:46.621
Dance to the good cash money,

42:46.656 --> 42:52.020
Son,

42:52.055 --> 42:56.121
'Cause I know I believe that

42:56.156 --> 43:00.188
Country air is the only thing

43:00.223 --> 43:05.720
That's fit to breathe,

43:05.755 --> 43:08.171
And all the things that I can

43:08.206 --> 43:10.588
See are breaking up all around

43:10.623 --> 43:14.352
Me,

43:14.387 --> 43:16.970
To far away *

43:17.005 --> 43:19.519
Janet? Janet!

43:19.554 --> 43:22.488
* and I can't see that star,

43:22.523 --> 43:24.155
And I can't hear that

43:24.190 --> 43:25.287
Thunder... *

43:25.322 --> 43:28.319
Hey.

43:28.354 --> 43:34.188
* out in the wild blue

43:34.223 --> 43:34.853
Yonder,

43:34.888 --> 43:37.137
The wild blue yonder,

43:37.172 --> 43:39.396
The wild blue yonder,

43:39.431 --> 43:41.621
The wild blue yonder *
