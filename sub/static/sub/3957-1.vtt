00:40.440 --> 00:44.439
I'm Dr Khan's replacement. Dr Gill.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.199
You can call me Kester.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.039
- Is it Rachel?
- Rae.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.759
I told Dr Khan to ask you
to start keeping a diary.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.559
But you can't read it
because Dr Khan...

01:00.560 --> 01:02.399
I don't want to read it.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.399
It's private. It's for you.

01:10.840 --> 01:14.839
Are you always this quiet?

01:16.760 --> 01:19.319
You know, there's a theory

01:19.320 --> 01:22.279
that you can discern the majority
of a person's characteristics

01:22.280 --> 01:25.839
in the first five seconds
of meeting them.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.439
What do your instincts say about me?

01:27.440 --> 01:31.439
My instincts say that a bird
took a dump on your head.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.839
So...

01:35.840 --> 01:39.839
You survived the first week
still in one piece, I see.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.839
What have we been up to?

01:41.840 --> 01:44.439
Look, with Dr Khan,
we would just talk...

01:44.440 --> 01:48.439
I'm not Dr Khan.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.159
So...

01:51.160 --> 01:55.159
what have we been up to this week?

01:58.760 --> 02:02.759
Not much.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.879
Big lie. This week has, in fact,
been pretty momentous.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.359
Wednesday, 10th July, 1996.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.999
Freedom.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.999
Dear Diary, I'm 16,
I weigh 16.5 stone

02:21.480 --> 02:23.879
and I live in Lincolnshire.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.879
My interests include music, vegging
out and finding a fit boy...

02:29.120 --> 02:33.119
Oh, scratch that, any boy,
to quench my ever-growing horn.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.719
Unfortunately, I already have a
lover that makes me look pregnant.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.399
Food.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.399
But, well, there is a difference
between snacking and bingeing.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.399
And I don't binge any more.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.959
And if anyone ever finds this diary

02:50.960 --> 02:54.959
and reads it and comes to
the conclusion that I'm crazy...

02:59.080 --> 03:00.419
they'd be spot on.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.559
Go away. I'm not speaking
to you.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.799
Why not?

03:42.800 --> 03:46.799
You're abandoning me. You're leaving
me here with all the mentals.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.919
I'll be back for my sessions
all the time.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.839
You won't be back.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.639
You'll be off going to loads
of parties,

03:53.640 --> 03:55.319
boy parties.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.319
Tix, we both know that there are
zero cool people in Lincolnshire.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.559
Tissue, please, Skinny.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.879
Did you get a new toothbrush?

04:21.920 --> 04:24.199
I'm gonna miss you.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.199
'Poor, lovely, messed-up Tixy.'

04:28.480 --> 04:32.479
Here.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.919
Go.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.799
Hi, Rae.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.199
Hi.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.479
'Dr Nick Kassar,

04:55.480 --> 04:58.479
'expert moistener of lady gardens.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.479
'I wanna eat his face!'

05:03.360 --> 05:05.159
It's, erm... It's good for the skin.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.119
Yeah, I know, yeah.
I drink two litres a day.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.359
Problem is, it makes you go to the
loo every half hour.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.839
I'm getting picked up in 20 minutes.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.279
What a shame.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.479
Why is that?

05:19.480 --> 05:23.479
Because I never got a chance
to do a sex on you.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.199
Rae.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.759
Yeah.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.279
Don't get up to any mischief.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.039
Well, don't go changing!

05:34.040 --> 05:36.319
You keep drinking that water!

05:36.320 --> 05:40.319
'Oh, God. Why do I always say
such twattish things?'

05:42.280 --> 05:45.159
Four months locked away.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.879
Four months convincing people

05:46.880 --> 05:50.879
my finger is no longer on the
self-destruct button.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.639
Finally, I was leaving.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.359
Finally, I was free.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.399
I'm not ready.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.359
Where are you?
Outside.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.439
I'm freaking out.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.119
I'm having a freak-out.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.799
Just count to ten.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.639
I'm not strong enough
to make it on my own.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.799
You're not on your own. You've got
your mum and all your friends.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.959
My mum's a nightmare,
and I haven't got any friends.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.759
You're my friend.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.439
The pips are going.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.439
What if something really bad
happens?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.719
What if I have a proper freak-out,
what then?

06:46.720 --> 06:47.799
Just count to ten.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.839
Yeah, but...

07:01.680 --> 07:05.679
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.599
I'm sorry I was late.
It's only been ten minutes.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.239
40 minutes.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.959
Give over with your 40 minutes.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.959
You talk more random
than duck shite sometimes.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.399
D'you want one?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.919
When have I ever smoked?

07:41.920 --> 07:45.919
You might have started.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.839
Might have some Blue Ribands
in the glove box.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.839
No, no. I can't, love.
No, I'm on the alphabet diet.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.159
The what?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.839
Each week, you only eat food
beginning with a certain letter.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.839
Makes you rotate all your food types.
This week it's W.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.199
So, you've nearly done
the entire alphabet?

08:16.200 --> 08:19.599
No. I started on S, cos I bought
a load of Scotch eggs on the cheap.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.039
I've lost six pounds, though.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.039
That's, what, just over a month,

08:24.040 --> 08:26.479
month and a bit.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.679
Have Blue Ribands got wafer in it?

08:28.680 --> 08:32.679
Wafer begins with a W.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.359
Oh, no.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.959
Rae?

09:21.960 --> 09:23.039
Who's that?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.159
Chloe.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.319
Rae! Oh, my God!

09:25.320 --> 09:28.639
Chloe? Blood and stomach pills,
she's blossomed.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.639
Look at the chest.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.719
Please don't embarrass me.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.199
Oh, get over yourself.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.679
And don't be long. We're in a rush.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.919
Oh, my God! Come here!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.919
Why didn't you tell me you were
back? How was France?

09:49.920 --> 09:52.359
France?

09:52.360 --> 09:56.259
Yeah, it was great.
It was really nice.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.759
I can't believe you've been gone
three months.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.639
Four months.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.839
- Yeah, well...
- Rae!

10:02.840 --> 10:04.319
I'm glad you're back, anyway...

10:04.320 --> 10:05.919
Thanks.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.399
I should go.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.079
Oh, no, no, no. Listen, listen...

10:13.080 --> 10:14.759
Come to the pub tonight
with the gang.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.519
I've started hanging round with the
sixth formers from Wellesley Park.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.519
The guys are fit as, right?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.559
- And they're all single.
- Chop!

10:25.560 --> 10:27.279
So, please come, sweets.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.279
Please!

10:34.400 --> 10:38.399
'Yes, please...'

10:39.360 --> 10:40.119
Yeah?

10:40.120 --> 10:42.719
I mean, um, yeah...

10:42.720 --> 10:46.719
I'm a bit busy, but it would be cool
to hang out with you.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.439
In France, all I did was hang.
Definitely.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.879
I'd probably get withdrawal symptoms
if I stopped hanging.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.039
Yeah.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.359
Rae!

11:06.560 --> 11:08.999
Well, I'll see you later, then.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.599
Bye.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.039
France?!

11:14.040 --> 11:17.079
Well, I had to say something.
You told me not to tell anyone.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.479
France?!

11:18.480 --> 11:22.479
Why didn't you just say
I had glandular fever or summat?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.039
'Welcome to the house of pain.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.399
'Barely enough room for one person,

11:33.400 --> 11:35.359
'let alone me and her.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.359
'I'm not even in
and I wanna get out.'

11:40.280 --> 11:44.279
Come on, Rachel.
I've got something to show you.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.719
What?

12:00.185 --> 12:03.024
Rae, this is Karim.

12:03.025 --> 12:04.864
My lover.

12:04.865 --> 12:06.664
Isn't he something?

12:10.225 --> 12:14.224
Ohhh! Say hello! Say hello,
say hello.

12:14.975 --> 12:16.214
Pleased to meet you.

12:16.215 --> 12:18.894
Why were you in the boot?

12:18.895 --> 12:21.214
Oh... Well, he can't speak
much English.

12:21.215 --> 12:23.854
He speaks Arabic and French.

12:23.855 --> 12:26.054
That's what they speak in Tunisia.

12:26.055 --> 12:28.254
Er... Help...

12:28.255 --> 12:32.254
Right, who'd like a sticky waffle?

12:32.415 --> 12:35.294
Why was he in the chuffing boot?

12:35.295 --> 12:39.294
Look... Right, look.
He hasn't done anything wrong,

12:39.615 --> 12:41.254
but there are people looking for him.

12:41.255 --> 12:42.734
What people?
Immigration.

12:42.735 --> 12:46.374
He's not allowed to be here.
Not just yet. Not just for now.

12:46.463 --> 12:47.542
He, er...

12:47.543 --> 12:50.662
He ran away
from this holding place, and...

12:50.663 --> 12:53.022
we fell in love.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.022
Now, no-one can know about this.

12:55.023 --> 12:58.982
Not just for now. Is that OK, Rachel?

12:59.703 --> 13:00.822
Oh, Karim!

13:00.823 --> 13:02.702
Put me down, you bloody beast!

13:02.703 --> 13:06.702
Oh!

13:06.783 --> 13:09.902
There is a difference
between snacking and bingeing.

13:09.903 --> 13:13.902
And I don't binge any more.

13:28.623 --> 13:31.582
Ever feel like you're returning
to the scene of a crime?

14:06.543 --> 14:10.502
Oh, Damon. I love you,
but I've gotta get out of this house

14:10.503 --> 14:12.942
and meet some real boys.

14:18.543 --> 14:20.342
Right, look.

14:20.343 --> 14:23.142
Before you meet everyone,
just try and be cool, yeah?

14:23.143 --> 14:27.142
I could try and get you in with them,
but they're a pretty exclusive bunch,

14:27.343 --> 14:30.862
so... just don't be upset
if it doesn't happen.

14:30.863 --> 14:32.302
OK?
Yeah.

14:32.303 --> 14:33.422
You ready?
Yeah.

14:33.423 --> 14:34.542

You trying to get us kicked out?

16:36.875 --> 16:39.354
'I guess I kind of had
my own stuff going on.

16:39.355 --> 16:43.354
'Like wondering why my best friend
was growing apart from me.

16:43.435 --> 16:47.434
'Like wondering why I was having
a secret mental breakdown.

16:48.275 --> 16:52.034
'But whatever. It's complicated, '
I guess.

16:52.035 --> 16:53.274
There's no topping on this.

16:53.275 --> 16:57.274
There's no topping on this.
You've opened the box
upside down, you div.

16:58.275 --> 16:59.554
'Then there's Izzy.

16:59.555 --> 17:03.554
'She's so cute. I've only known her
for two hours, but I can't imagine

17:04.755 --> 17:07.434
'she'd have a negative thought
about...anything.'

17:07.435 --> 17:10.034
You two are so like a married couple
sometimes.

17:10.035 --> 17:12.434
Uh, gross!
It'd be like marrying me sister.

17:12.435 --> 17:14.794
Yeah! So gross!

17:14.795 --> 17:17.034
'There's three boys.

17:17.035 --> 17:21.034
'Chop. Rating - slice.

17:21.035 --> 17:23.314
'He doesn't even go to school.

17:23.315 --> 17:26.753
'Chloe says he works down at some
garage, fixing cars or summat.'

17:26.755 --> 17:30.754
I don't care what you say, Jennifer
Aniston is fitter than Pammy.

17:31.115 --> 17:33.874
There's only one woman
that's fitter than both.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.074
Bollocks. Who?

17:35.075 --> 17:36.354
Your mum!

17:39.375 --> 17:40.234
No...

17:40.235 --> 17:43.154
'And Finn's a bit of a grumpy sod.

17:43.155 --> 17:45.394
'He's such an epic slice,

17:45.395 --> 17:48.194
'but he massively knows it.'

17:48.195 --> 17:52.194
Argh!

17:53.915 --> 17:56.554
'And finally...

17:56.555 --> 18:00.394
'..Archie. Ultimate slice.

18:00.395 --> 18:02.154
'Half geek, half rock god.

18:02.155 --> 18:05.634
'So hot, he'd make a priest kick
a hole in a stained-glass window.

18:05.635 --> 18:09.634
'I wanna do 14,000 romances on him.'

18:51.835 --> 18:54.354
'I couldn't believe it.

18:54.355 --> 18:57.714
'There were cool people
in Lincolnshire.

18:57.715 --> 18:59.874
'This was it.

18:59.875 --> 19:03.874
'This was my chance.'

19:05.995 --> 19:07.354
Oh, everyone.
What?

19:07.355 --> 19:10.474
Announcement, right?
Party at mine on Saturday

19:10.475 --> 19:12.434
to celebrate Izzy's birthday.

19:14.075 --> 19:18.074
'And all I had to do was just...'

19:19.715 --> 19:20.914
Here y'are, Chloe's mate!

19:20.915 --> 19:24.914
Take a picture!

19:26.755 --> 19:28.114
It's Rae.

19:28.115 --> 19:31.714
May, take a picture of us, will you?

19:38.555 --> 19:42.554
Chop, your guns
nearly don't fit in that picture!

20:05.555 --> 20:07.554
I've decided.

20:07.555 --> 20:11.554
There are three ways Archie
is gonna go out with me.

20:11.595 --> 20:14.834
One - if he's secretly
got a thing for big women,

20:14.835 --> 20:17.474
like Lenny Henry has
for Dawn French.

20:17.475 --> 20:19.554
Two - apocalyptic catastrophe

20:19.555 --> 20:22.034
takes out all of the women
on the Earth,

20:22.035 --> 20:25.194
and therefore my humps become
a precious commodity.

20:25.195 --> 20:28.954
Three - I feed him biscuits
until he's fat too.

20:35.995 --> 20:39.994
If this goes in the bin, Archie will
definitely sleep with me.

21:10.595 --> 21:12.194
I had to see you.

21:12.195 --> 21:16.194
What are you doing here?

21:16.915 --> 21:18.514
Let's not talk.

21:32.675 --> 21:35.194
Mmm. Kiss my neck, Archie.

21:35.195 --> 21:36.354
Please, for me.

21:36.355 --> 21:37.474
What?

21:37.475 --> 21:38.594
Please, I beg you.

21:38.595 --> 21:41.474
Why are you talking like that?

21:41.475 --> 21:43.034
Please.

21:43.035 --> 21:47.034
Oh, Karim!
Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim! Oh!

21:47.435 --> 21:50.474
Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim!

21:50.475 --> 21:52.154
Oh, my God!

21:52.155 --> 21:56.154
I...can't... believe it!

22:07.595 --> 22:08.474
What?

22:08.475 --> 22:12.354
Do you have any idea what time
it is?

22:12.355 --> 22:13.674
It's quarter to five.

22:13.675 --> 22:15.274
It's quarter to five.

22:15.275 --> 22:18.914
And I'm awake!

22:18.915 --> 22:21.994
What do you want? A chufty badge
and a round of applause?

22:21.995 --> 22:25.754
I want to go to sleep knowing that
I'm not gonna be woken up

22:25.755 --> 22:29.194
by the sound of you
getting your bones jumped.

22:29.195 --> 22:30.954
I beg your pardon?!

22:30.955 --> 22:33.594
Just stop having sex at top volume,
yeah?

22:33.595 --> 22:35.234
I didn't know we were being loud.

22:35.235 --> 22:38.634
There's people in Peterborough that
think the world's coming to an end.

22:38.635 --> 22:42.234
Oh, come on, Rachel. You talk more
random than duck shite sometimes.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.874
Will you just stop saying that?

22:43.875 --> 22:46.794
It's just stupid.

22:46.795 --> 22:50.194
You watch your tone with me,
young lady.

22:50.195 --> 22:52.594
You remember who you're talking to.

22:52.595 --> 22:54.874
D'you know what?

22:54.875 --> 22:56.794
'And then I said it.

22:56.795 --> 22:59.474
'The worst thing I've ever said
to my mum.

22:59.475 --> 23:01.954
'And, as I'm feeling mega guilty
anyway,

23:01.955 --> 23:05.154
'we might as well do the top three.'

23:05.155 --> 23:09.154
Mum, why's your bum bigger
than all the other mums' bums?

23:10.595 --> 23:13.674
Rachel... Earl!

23:13.675 --> 23:17.154
Come on.

23:17.155 --> 23:18.754
I wanted a Kylie one.

23:18.755 --> 23:21.234
Well, maybe I couldn't afford
a Kylie one.

23:21.235 --> 23:25.234
Maybe if you hadn't made Dad leave,
we'd be able to get nice things.

23:25.355 --> 23:29.354
Rachel... Earl!

23:29.915 --> 23:33.914
All right!

23:34.635 --> 23:36.674
It's no wonder I went mental, is it?

23:36.675 --> 23:39.554
When I've got the biggest screw-up

23:39.555 --> 23:43.554
in the history of screw-ups
for a parent.

23:44.355 --> 23:48.154
Go on. Say it.

23:48.155 --> 23:52.154
"Rachel Earl!"

24:06.235 --> 24:09.318
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

24:16.377 --> 24:20.376
Thursday, the 11th of July, 1996.

24:21.137 --> 24:25.136
No-one's called.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.536
I loved Thursdays in the hospital.

24:27.982 --> 24:29.541
In the mornings,

24:29.542 --> 24:31.121
me and Tix would catch up
on the charts

24:31.206 --> 24:32.805
and have toast.

24:32.806 --> 24:35.765
And in the afternoon, we'd have
group and then go out to the lake

24:35.766 --> 24:39.765
with Danny Two Hats
and play Ten Questions.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.605
But now, there's a new gang,
I suppose.

24:43.606 --> 24:47.205
But why haven't they called?

24:47.206 --> 24:51.205
Have I fucked it up already?

25:09.206 --> 25:13.165
Rae?

25:13.166 --> 25:14.605
What are you doing here?

25:14.606 --> 25:15.805
I was just passing.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.605
I thought I'd nip in.

25:17.606 --> 25:21.365
I would have rang to say we were all
coming down, but...

25:21.366 --> 25:23.325
it was kind of a spontaneous thing.

25:23.326 --> 25:26.885
You know how it is.

25:26.886 --> 25:30.645
Archie, put summat decent on
the jukebox, will you?

25:30.646 --> 25:33.605
'Music. My turf.

25:33.606 --> 25:36.085
'Go big or go home.'

25:36.086 --> 25:36.725
I'll do it.

25:36.726 --> 25:38.205
No, I want Archie to do it.

25:38.206 --> 25:39.965
He knows his music.

25:39.966 --> 25:41.085
I know my music.

25:41.086 --> 25:42.845
Look, May...
Rae.

25:42.846 --> 25:44.525
As in Raymond?
As in Rachel.

25:44.526 --> 25:48.525
Whatever. Rae, it's my 20p, and I
want Archie to do it, all right?

25:48.886 --> 25:52.885
If you don't like what I put on,
I'll give you your 20p back.

26:01.726 --> 26:05.725
It was time to drop the big guns.

26:05.726 --> 26:08.765
And I hereby present my case
for gang membership.

26:08.766 --> 26:11.045
Spin on that, Finn.

26:16.646 --> 26:19.685
Tune!

26:19.686 --> 26:20.645
Nice one!

26:20.646 --> 26:23.605
Yeah, it's not
bad... for mainstream.

26:23.606 --> 26:27.605
I don't think we've been introduced
properly. I'm Archie.

26:28.006 --> 26:29.365
Hi, Archie.

26:29.366 --> 26:32.765
'I'd shag him until there was
nothing left.

26:32.766 --> 26:36.765
'Just a pair of glasses
and a damp patch.'

26:37.326 --> 26:40.685
Rae, you're still coming to my party
on Saturday, right?

26:40.686 --> 26:41.725
Am I invited?

26:41.726 --> 26:45.725
Of course you are! Silly moo!

26:45.886 --> 26:47.245
Tell everyone!

26:47.246 --> 26:49.005
All right.

26:49.006 --> 26:51.765
Right, listen. As you all know,

26:51.766 --> 26:55.205
I am proper excited
about moving into my new house,

26:55.206 --> 26:59.205
so I am delighted to say that my
party on Saturday night

26:59.566 --> 27:01.685
will be my first ever...

27:01.686 --> 27:02.805
pool party.

27:02.806 --> 27:04.285
Whoo!

27:04.286 --> 27:08.285
Pool party? Get in there!

27:10.966 --> 27:12.925
Are you kidding me?!

27:12.926 --> 27:16.685
Who wants a snakebite?
Yeah, I do.

27:16.686 --> 27:18.765
Go on, you can do it!

27:18.766 --> 27:21.965
You can do it!

27:21.966 --> 27:25.965
Yes!

27:26.406 --> 27:27.909
'I am...'

27:32.126 --> 27:35.085
Friday, the 12th of July.

27:35.086 --> 27:38.365
My first hangover.

27:38.366 --> 27:42.365
I felt like an orang-utan
had been sick on my brain.

27:43.566 --> 27:47.565
The big question is,
one piece, bikini or monokini?

27:48.886 --> 27:52.885
Well, where's the makes-you-not-look
like-a-massive-bloater-kini?

27:55.086 --> 27:56.725
What?

27:56.726 --> 27:57.845
Nothing.

27:57.846 --> 28:00.765
Well, come on, try them on.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.565
'There was a time when I refused

28:06.566 --> 28:10.245
'to wear anything
other than a swimsuit.'

28:10.246 --> 28:14.245
Will you help me get a pasty,
please?

28:15.446 --> 28:18.445
You shouldn't eat too many of these,
you'll get fat.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.685
I don't care if I get fat.
They taste nice.

28:20.686 --> 28:24.085
But if you get fat,
you won't be able to wear a swimsuit

28:24.086 --> 28:25.765
and boys won't like you.

28:25.766 --> 28:27.045
I don't like boys.

28:27.046 --> 28:28.805
And even if I did like boys

28:28.806 --> 28:31.805
and I was fat and I wore a swimsuit,
they'd like me anyway.

28:31.806 --> 28:33.525
Why would they like you?

28:33.526 --> 28:35.285
Because I'm brilliant.

28:35.286 --> 28:39.285
Rae!

28:40.406 --> 28:43.845
'There's no fucking way
anyone's gonna see me in this.'

28:43.846 --> 28:47.605
Phhhhh...

28:54.726 --> 28:56.365
What are you doing?

28:56.366 --> 28:57.565
Burning one?

28:57.566 --> 28:58.645
But you don't smoke.

28:58.646 --> 29:00.125
Well, I started yesterday.

29:00.126 --> 29:03.205
You know, it keeps you thin.

29:06.406 --> 29:08.085
We're evacuating the store.
Yep.

29:08.086 --> 29:10.205
We really need to get out
of the store.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.885
If you need to cover yourself up
with this.

29:11.886 --> 29:14.205
What?
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

29:14.206 --> 29:18.205
Let's just go, thank you.

29:21.270 --> 29:23.069
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Rae.

29:24.590 --> 29:28.589
Just ignore them, Rae.

29:33.830 --> 29:36.829
Oi, Jabba! D'you want this burger?
I've lost my appetite.

29:36.830 --> 29:38.629
Rae?
Jabba, Jabba, Jabba!

29:38.630 --> 29:40.269
Oh, my God, no!
What's going on?

29:40.270 --> 29:42.109
Jabba, Jabba, Jabba!
What's going on?

29:42.110 --> 29:43.469
Just ignore them, Rae.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.789
One.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.469
Two.

30:14.470 --> 30:16.989
Three.

30:16.990 --> 30:20.869
Four. Five.

30:20.870 --> 30:22.989
Six.

30:22.990 --> 30:26.709
Seven.

30:26.710 --> 30:29.349
Eight.

30:29.350 --> 30:33.349
Nine.

31:45.310 --> 31:47.149
I'm back.

31:47.150 --> 31:49.389
I lasted, what?

31:49.390 --> 31:52.629
Two days?

31:52.630 --> 31:55.269
Something happened.

31:55.270 --> 31:57.829
It was so embarrassing.

32:00.430 --> 32:04.429
My skin feels itchy with it.

32:05.270 --> 32:08.669
I hate to think that people
would have gone home and...

32:08.670 --> 32:11.549
talked about it...

32:11.550 --> 32:14.189
like it was a joke...

32:14.190 --> 32:18.189
over their Yorkshire puddings
or summat.

32:22.150 --> 32:26.149
It's too much out there.

32:27.430 --> 32:31.429
I don't even know how to explain it.

32:32.710 --> 32:36.709
It smashes up all of your senses.

32:39.350 --> 32:43.349
I'm not strong enough
to deal with it all on my own.

32:55.510 --> 32:59.509
Tissue, please, Fatty.

33:16.430 --> 33:20.429
What are you doing here?

33:20.550 --> 33:22.349
I've, um...

33:22.789 --> 33:23.908
I've got some good news.

33:23.909 --> 33:25.468
What?

33:25.469 --> 33:27.968
Decided to come back.

33:28.014 --> 33:32.013
I just don't think I'm ready.

33:42.856 --> 33:44.215
What are you doing?

33:44.216 --> 33:48.215
Stop it! Stop it!

33:49.845 --> 33:53.244
Just stop it!

33:53.245 --> 33:56.844
Everyone in here is holding on to
their lives by their fingertips, Rae.

33:56.845 --> 34:00.024
And you get given a chance
to start again

34:00.046 --> 34:04.045
and you don't want it!

34:04.246 --> 34:06.565
I don't like it out there.

34:06.566 --> 34:10.565
No! You don't like it anywhere,
because you don't like yourself.

34:12.846 --> 34:15.284
You'd better start doing.

34:15.286 --> 34:19.085
Because I've been trying
to be more like you for months.

34:19.085 --> 34:23.085
And if there's no hope for you
then what hope is there for me?

34:24.446 --> 34:28.445
What if something bad happened,
something really bad?

34:28.606 --> 34:31.804
I tried counting to ten,
and it didn't work.

34:31.806 --> 34:35.804
Then you put on your Rae armour
and you charge at it.

34:39.206 --> 34:43.205
Promise me you won't come back.

34:44.886 --> 34:48.885
But I really miss you.

35:04.206 --> 35:08.205
So, the pool party.

35:10.006 --> 35:12.605
Turn up to a pool party with a bag
of booze nicked from your mum,

35:12.606 --> 35:16.605
and no-one'll care if you swim
or not.

35:16.926 --> 35:19.485
But how to escape?

35:25.406 --> 35:26.585
Ah!

35:34.246 --> 35:36.685
Jesus, Rae!

35:36.686 --> 35:38.840
You've bloody ruined my flowerbeds.

35:40.456 --> 35:42.635
All right, all right.

35:46.675 --> 35:48.154
You smell like a brewery.

35:48.155 --> 35:51.034
Next time you wanna borrow
some booze, just ask.

35:51.035 --> 35:55.034
We haven't got the right guttering
for sneaking in and out of windows.

35:56.915 --> 35:59.154
Take off your top off.
Let's have a look at your back.

35:59.155 --> 36:00.594
No! No way!

36:00.595 --> 36:02.754
Come on. It's not like
I haven't seen it all before.

36:02.755 --> 36:05.674
When you were little, you used to run
around naked all the time.

36:05.675 --> 36:09.554
Yeah, well, I'm not a kid any more.

36:09.555 --> 36:11.314
Karim.

36:14.955 --> 36:18.954
Right, let's have a look
at your back.

36:19.655 --> 36:20.734
Ow!

36:20.773 --> 36:22.732
Right, right. It's just a bruise.

36:22.733 --> 36:26.492
OK.

36:31.853 --> 36:35.692
You sure you're all right
about going to the pub and things?

36:35.693 --> 36:37.332
I do worry about you, you know.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.852
I'm fine.

36:39.853 --> 36:43.852
Are you still going
to this pool thing today, then?

36:45.773 --> 36:48.412
It doesn't matter
what people think about you.

36:48.413 --> 36:51.652
Yeah, you're not the one who has to
stand in a swimming costume

36:51.653 --> 36:54.972
next to Chloe
with her gravity-defying boobs.

36:54.973 --> 36:58.972
I'm gonna look like a condom
filled with Bolognese sauce.

37:01.533 --> 37:04.852
You remember when you were little,
and we went to Butlin's,

37:04.853 --> 37:08.852
and you said I had a big arse
in front of Sally Crowther's parents?

37:09.413 --> 37:12.212
No.

37:12.213 --> 37:14.132
Why, did it upset you?

37:14.133 --> 37:17.612
You get used to it.

37:17.613 --> 37:19.012
Besides, I was sleeping

37:19.013 --> 37:23.012
with Sally Crowther's dad
at the time, so made no odds, really.

37:26.333 --> 37:30.332
Got it. Yep.

37:32.053 --> 37:34.852
I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.

37:34.853 --> 37:38.852
In the kitchen.

37:40.853 --> 37:42.012
Wait.

37:42.013 --> 37:43.052
Got it.
Mum...

37:43.053 --> 37:44.732
It's all right. Look, look, look.

37:44.733 --> 37:48.732
Oh!

37:52.613 --> 37:56.612
Rae?

37:57.493 --> 37:59.372
Hey, Rae.
Hey.

37:59.373 --> 38:02.732
There's something different
about you today.

38:02.733 --> 38:05.972
Where's your inflatable crocodile?

38:05.973 --> 38:08.332
Actually, I thought you were
fantastic.

38:08.333 --> 38:11.372
There's not many people that could
have styled that out like you did.

38:11.373 --> 38:15.372
Come on. Let's stay here and chat.
I don't fancy a swim.

38:18.053 --> 38:19.132
Why not?

38:19.133 --> 38:21.052
I don't really wanna talk about it.

38:21.053 --> 38:22.452
Tell me.
No.

38:22.453 --> 38:24.012
You'll laugh.

38:24.013 --> 38:25.252
Maybe.

38:25.253 --> 38:28.012
Um...

38:28.013 --> 38:31.132
Well, er...

38:31.133 --> 38:32.452
I've got spots on my back.

38:32.453 --> 38:36.452
Like, back acne.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.212
Bacne?
Yeah.

38:38.213 --> 38:39.492
Show me.

38:39.493 --> 38:40.652
No way.

38:40.653 --> 38:42.772
Show me.

38:42.773 --> 38:45.772
Show me.

38:45.773 --> 38:49.772
No laughing.
All right.

38:50.773 --> 38:52.212
'Oh, my God.

38:52.213 --> 38:55.452
'Even his spots were really sexy!'

38:55.453 --> 38:56.532
Well?

38:56.533 --> 39:00.532
Well, there's hardly anything there.
No-one's gonna see anything.

39:01.093 --> 39:05.092
Look, let's make a deal.
I'll go in if you go in.

39:06.853 --> 39:10.852
All right.

39:12.693 --> 39:15.252
Aarghhh...!

39:55.093 --> 39:56.772
Stop it!

40:06.893 --> 40:08.332
Is there something wrong?

40:08.333 --> 40:09.172
No. Why?

40:09.173 --> 40:11.932
So, why aren't you getting involved?

40:11.933 --> 40:13.452
I'm DJ-ing. Dur.

40:13.453 --> 40:17.092
Well, we don't need a DJ.
Just stick on NOW 33.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.172
Are you kidding me? It's got
Father And Son by Boyzone on it.

40:20.173 --> 40:22.932
Yeah, well,
we'll just get out and skip it.

40:22.933 --> 40:26.932
You're not gonna make friends if you
sit on the sidelines all the time.

40:28.453 --> 40:31.572
Are people talking about that?

40:31.573 --> 40:33.172
They might be.

40:33.173 --> 40:37.172
Look, you don't want people thinking
you're weird, do you?

40:37.493 --> 40:40.292
You don't want people thinking
you're not normal.

40:40.293 --> 40:44.292
Just come in.

40:45.493 --> 40:49.492
You are boring.

41:04.213 --> 41:05.332
Get on my back!

41:05.333 --> 41:06.852
No!
Get on my back.

41:06.853 --> 41:08.892
I wanna see how long
you can hold your breath.

41:24.653 --> 41:28.652
Oh, God.

41:40.813 --> 41:43.572
So, that's it. You went to a party...

41:43.573 --> 41:47.572
and the party was OK.

41:49.293 --> 41:53.292
Rae, these sessions are meant to be
a time when you can open up,

41:54.413 --> 41:58.412
discuss with someone, confidentially,
how you're really feeling.

41:58.813 --> 42:02.812
I told you. It was all right.

42:04.253 --> 42:06.172
Tell me how you're feeling right now,

42:06.173 --> 42:10.172
but be honest.

42:10.693 --> 42:14.692
OK. I'll tell you how l feel, yeah?

42:14.733 --> 42:16.692
Two weeks ago, my wife kicked me out.

42:16.693 --> 42:19.212
I've been stopping on my brother's
couch ever since.

42:19.213 --> 42:22.092
This morning,
I wake up, and there's no milk.

42:22.093 --> 42:25.572
I bought that fucking milk, and he
used it to drown his Sugar Puffs in.

42:25.573 --> 42:29.012
So, with no cup of coffee, I come to
work, I get shat on by a pigeon,

42:29.013 --> 42:33.012
I meet my new patient, and she's
about as open as a nun's foo.

42:37.533 --> 42:41.532
So...how do you feel?

42:43.133 --> 42:46.012
Pffff...

42:46.013 --> 42:50.012
I feel like I hate being here.

42:51.053 --> 42:53.412
I feel like I hate this room.

42:53.413 --> 42:57.332
What do you hate most about it?

42:57.333 --> 42:58.932
Well, the pictures.

42:58.933 --> 43:02.932
They're shit.

43:16.813 --> 43:20.432
Won't you get into trouble for that?

43:20.433 --> 43:21.932
No. If anyone asks,
I'll tell them that you did it.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.252
I'll say you're lying.

43:23.253 --> 43:26.052
Who will they believe? I'm not the
one with a history of mental illness.

43:26.053 --> 43:27.572
Oh, wow!

43:27.573 --> 43:29.612
What about the ink blot?

43:29.613 --> 43:33.212
Oh, that reminds me
of a sanitary towel.

43:33.213 --> 43:37.212
Then out it goes.

43:38.853 --> 43:40.212
Oh!

43:41.933 --> 43:44.932
What about Buster Keaton here?

43:44.933 --> 43:48.932
No. I quite like that one.

43:49.853 --> 43:53.852
Yeah. Me too.

43:59.933 --> 44:03.492
What did your instincts say
about me...

44:03.493 --> 44:07.492
after five seconds?

44:08.773 --> 44:10.452
I can't remember.

44:10.453 --> 44:14.452
I don't believe you.

44:15.933 --> 44:19.812
My instincts said...

44:19.813 --> 44:23.812
that you see yourself
as a fragile thing.

44:24.293 --> 44:26.172
Like a little broken bird

44:26.173 --> 44:29.492
sloshing around in a bottle.

44:29.493 --> 44:33.492
But if you trust me,
if we trust each other...

44:33.853 --> 44:37.812
that you'll be all right.

44:37.813 --> 44:41.812
Because, basically,
I think you're a pretty tough cookie.

45:01.453 --> 45:04.532
- Chop?
- Yes, my dear.

45:04.533 --> 45:07.612
Come and use those big swans
you've been building

45:07.613 --> 45:09.972
to prise my fat butt
out of this slide.

45:09.973 --> 45:13.972
Not a problem, Rae.

45:22.653 --> 45:25.852
Barman!
A lemon Hooch if you'd be so kind.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.772
And turn that shit off.

45:35.653 --> 45:38.092
Who's going to the chippy,
cos I'm yamming?

45:38.093 --> 45:40.212
Oh, maybe we should play a game
for it.

45:40.213 --> 45:42.372
All right. Yeah. I've got
a good one.

45:42.373 --> 45:43.692
What?

45:43.693 --> 45:45.132
Maybe...

45:45.133 --> 45:49.132
last one into the pool should go.

45:52.093 --> 45:53.212
Whoo!

45:53.213 --> 45:55.012
Weh-hey!

45:55.013 --> 45:58.452
Whoo!

45:58.453 --> 46:02.292
'The doctors looked at my legs
and said didn't it hurt?

46:02.293 --> 46:05.332
'"Didn't it hurt so much when you
were doing it

46:05.333 --> 46:07.212
'"that it burnt to breathe?"

46:07.213 --> 46:11.212
'At least they remind me that I
survived.

46:11.893 --> 46:15.892
'But only just.

46:17.573 --> 46:21.332
'I can't believe I've actually
got a group of friends.

46:21.333 --> 46:25.332
'I can't believe I'm finally out.'

46:25.853 --> 46:29.452
'I can't believe they actually think
I'm getting better.'
