WEBVTT

00:12.011 --> 00:15.056
You bit your finger off?
What problem was that solving?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.017
Obviously, it was an accident.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.310
How do you accidentally
bite off an appendage?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.439
Because I was trying to keep
my shit together around Carl,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.190
who I didn't kill, by the way.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.944
No credit there. Fine.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.156
I was biting my nails.
Then all of a sudden, crunch.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.574
Jesus Christ.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.076
You're stress-eating yourself.
Did anyone see you?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.245
No. I ran to the bathroom
and wrapped it up.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.706
And by the time I got back,
the investor had left.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.167
[sighs] It's a clean bite.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.669
-You think it can be reattached?
-I don't know.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.629
Maybe there's a way
to stick it back on.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.508
Rubber band, extension cord...
chip clip?

00:50.925 --> 00:51.760
No.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.054
Billy Joel CD, Blockbuster card--

00:54.137 --> 00:56.347
hey, one of our stress balls.
Remember these?

00:56.431 --> 00:59.392
[chuckles] "You won't be stressed
when you work with the best."

00:59.476 --> 01:01.853
Well, I think I'm pretty fucking stressed.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.315
Is this your toe?

01:06.483 --> 01:07.692
I didn't wanna throw it out.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.487
Well, it shouldn't be in the junk drawer.
It should be...

01:11.780 --> 01:14.157
Well, I guess we can put it back
in here for now.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.744
The only good thing
was Carl screwed up his pitch so badly,

01:17.827 --> 01:19.579
that the investor wants to hear my idea.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.415
So you and I are gonna go
present it to him tomorrow.

01:23.958 --> 01:28.213
No. You can't be around Carl.
You're chewing off pieces of yourself.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.799
Carl won't be there.
He was so humiliated

01:30.882 --> 01:34.594
that he claimed he'll be busy
golfing with all the living presidents.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.263
You could see on his face
he knew he overreached.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.308
Carl may not be at that meeting,
but there'll be a hundred more meetings.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.937
By the time we finish this project,
you'll just be a mouth on a chair.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.105
Jesus, Joel.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.482
A mouth I would still
proudly call my wife.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.484
Well, I'm not giving up on this project.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.695
I don't want to stop living
just because I'm undead!

01:55.448 --> 01:56.491
-Shit!
-Shit!

01:57.242 --> 01:58.701
Did you see where it went?

02:01.162 --> 02:03.498
-Oh, my God.
-Did you find it?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.500
Abby's pacifier.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.754
-Oh, my God, her "mi-mi."
-I know. So fast.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.048
-Shit!
-Shit!

02:15.426 --> 02:18.221
I got your text that it was the clams.
That's great news.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.181
I've already started researching
where Japopo's gets them.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.307
Now's not a good time.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.728
Real quick. Couldn't find
their supplier online, but I have a plan.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.440
Tomorrow, we go to Japopo's
posing as a father-son seafood company.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.318
We're business partners,
we're friends, we're family.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.862
My wife lost her finger.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.157
Like in a crab trap?
Probably hard to work that in,

02:37.240 --> 02:39.159
but it's great that you're already
thinking about backstory.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.368
[Sheila] Found it!

02:41.661 --> 02:42.954
And we've got ants.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.166
Just get inside.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.301
Do you think we can fix it?

02:56.676 --> 02:58.678
Yeah, because my toe would never stay on.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.055
Well, your toe rotted off,
so it was dead-dead.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.558
But your finger was severed,
so it's more living-dead,

03:03.641 --> 03:07.186
which means if we set it,
there's a chance it can go back to normal.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.187
What if it doesn't?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.148
I guess you could say
you had an accident.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.609
Joel and I were thinking crab trap.
Right, "Dad"?

03:13.192 --> 03:15.820
We're not posing
as father-son seafood distributors.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.865
The guy at Japopo's already thinks
I'm making a documentary about tipping.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.117
Don't get me wrong, there's a story
to be told there,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.328
but my plate is way too full.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.580
Sure, I get it.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.333
Ain't no thang, you know.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.793
Okay, try it now.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.841
Whoa.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.928
I can lose parts and reattach them.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.471
I'm like a snowman.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.848
Our lives just keep
getting better and better.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.517
I'd go easy on it for a few days.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.729
Months? Seconds? I don't know.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.523
But definitely do keep it dry.
Or moist?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.610
So, this was a reaction to your boss?

03:55.693 --> 03:58.238
Yeah, he was being
a condescending prick again.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.198
You should send Abby over there
with a lunch tray.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.200
She'll straighten him out.
[chuckles, snorts]

04:02.283 --> 04:03.618
[Sheila chuckles]

04:03.701 --> 04:05.203
-What do you mean?
-Yeah. What do you mean?

04:05.286 --> 04:07.372
-The tray thing.
-[both] What tray thing?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.581
What tray thing?

04:11.334 --> 04:14.170
I can't believe Abby smashed a boy
in the face with a tray.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.339
God, we have so much going on.
When does it end?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.174
We do have a lot of balls in the air.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.970
How do jugglers do it?
They keep five things going at once.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.555
And dangerous things-- chainsaws, knives.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.600
I once saw a juggler
juggle a smaller juggler.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.102
How is that dangerous?

04:29.185 --> 04:31.229
He was juggling
the smaller guy against his will.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.397
Oh.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.565
Was that part of the act or something
that just happened?

04:34.649 --> 04:38.653
I didn't see the start of it. The point is
juggling a lot of things is hard,

04:38.736 --> 04:41.155
especially if some of those things
don't want to be there.

04:44.742 --> 04:45.660
[Sheila sighs]

04:46.369 --> 04:47.829
So, what's the plan?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.206
We have all the information,
but she doesn't know that.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.001
-So for once, we're one step ahead.
-[Joel] Finally!

04:53.084 --> 04:55.336
[Sheila] I say we go in,
ask her about school,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.755
and give her the chance
to talk about the tray thing.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.965
-[Joel] Smart.
-Yes.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.049
I can hear you.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.343
-[Joel] Shit.
-[Sheila] Fuck.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.722
[Sheila] Abby, are you in there?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.141
[Joel] If so, your mother and I
would like to talk to you.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.435
Oh, my God. Come in.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.272
-Hey!
-Hi!

05:14.355 --> 05:18.359
Guys, I have some unprompted honesty
I'd love to share with you.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.986
I hit someone with a tray.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.613
Well, now we know.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.490
What we don't know
is what you were thinking.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.493
He was being a dick
to his ex-girlfriend online.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.329
Well, people can be jerks, Abby.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.707
But unless they come at you with a knife,
you can't attack them like that.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.876
Mom, you kill and eat people.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
I kill and eat people because I have to.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.422
I hit him with a tray because I had to.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.800
Your mother has a medical condition.
That comparison is offensive.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.761
-Right?
-Right.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.889
I'm just worried about your future.
You could get expelled.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.307
I'm not getting expelled.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.350
Principal Novak
couldn't get anyone to talk.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.645
No loose ends. I learned that from you.
Mostly from your mistakes.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.646
[Sheila scoffs]

05:55.730 --> 05:57.356
Yes, we're not good at murder.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.567
I happen to believe
that's a positive quality.

05:59.650 --> 06:03.946
And what I find most upsetting is that
you don't seem to have any remorse.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.365
-I don't.
-None?

06:07.867 --> 06:10.953
-Do you want me to lie and say that I do?
-Of course not.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.747
Right?

06:15.041 --> 06:18.211
What's happening to her?
Are we raising a monster?

06:18.294 --> 06:21.714
I don't know.
She's seen so much crazy stuff lately.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.842
I shouldn't have ripped apart
that Serbian guy in front of her.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.303
Looking back,
I might've handled that differently.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.891
I killed her best friend's stepdad
and put his body in our bathtub.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.851
That's not a story I'm gonna tell
at her wedding.

06:33.935 --> 06:38.523
-Oh, no. My finger's oozing again.
-Oh, Jesus.

06:39.857 --> 06:43.611
Are we kidding ourselves?
What if we can't keep all these balls up?

06:43.694 --> 06:44.570
We have to.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.322
It's so overwhelming.

06:46.405 --> 06:50.201
Abby, stopping a clam plague,
and now work's gotten weird.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.704
Our new sheriff neighbor is looking into
the murder of our old sheriff neighbor.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.998
I just wish you could eat chicken.

06:56.290 --> 07:00.169
All right, our first priority
is getting Abby back on track.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.172
So tomorrow,
we take her to see that boy she hit

07:03.256 --> 07:05.716
-and we make her apologize.
-Good idea.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.970
As the great juggler
Francisco Garibaldi once said,

07:09.053 --> 07:11.556
"When there's fear in your heart
and knives in the air,

07:11.639 --> 07:14.934
the wise juggler focuses on
but a single blade."

07:15.768 --> 07:17.937
What's with you and the juggling?

07:18.020 --> 07:21.065
I saw a cool documentary about a juggler.
You should watch it.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.568
-I'm not going to watch it.
-It has a great twist.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.528
Tell me about it.

07:26.696 --> 07:30.950
He had four wives and 18 children,
and none of them knew about each other.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.369
He was juggling balls and families.

07:33.703 --> 07:38.291
Wow. That's crazy.
I would've liked to have watched that.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.209
You can still watch it.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.296
No. You ruined it.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.227
I can't believe you guys are actually
making me do this.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.729
You apologized to all your victims?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.606
Let's stop comparing our behaviors.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.734
Someday, if you have kids, and you
get a virus, and start killing people,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.736
you'll appreciate how well
your mother and I are doing.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.030
It's true.
And then you're gonna call and be like,

08:09.113 --> 08:12.700
"Mom, oh, my God, this is so hard."
And I'll say, "Mm-hmm."

08:13.117 --> 08:14.577
We know over the last few weeks,

08:14.660 --> 08:17.121
we haven't been as focused
on parenting as we should have.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.998
But starting now,
we're gonna be more hands-on.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.083
And lesson number one is
when you hurt somebody--

08:21.167 --> 08:23.085
-Like by killing them?
-No. This is about you.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.004
When you do something wrong,
you take responsibility.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.381
By turning yourself into the police?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.592
No, still on you. You apologize.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.386
-To the loved ones you've left behind?
-I'm done. Your turn.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.680
Apologize or you're not getting
your iPad back.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.226
So blackmailing me into saying something
I don't believe

08:38.309 --> 08:39.519
is your idea of good parenting?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.562
So, you admit it is parenting.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.025
Fine. Let's get this over with.

08:48.069 --> 08:48.945
[doorbell rings]

08:49.028 --> 08:50.821
Impressive house. Great curb appeal.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.574
Yeah. If this goes well,
maybe we can leave our card.

08:57.203 --> 09:01.374
Hello. We're... Joel and Sheila Hammond.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.168
-I'm not used to using our actual names.
-Yeah, weird.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.920
And I believe you know our daughter Abby.

09:07.922 --> 09:08.965
I've seen her.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.301
She came here today to apologize.
Isn't that right, Abby?

09:14.470 --> 09:17.390
-That's correct.
-Sounds like you don't really want to.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.141
Nope.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.019
[chuckles] Tight. Come on in.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.312
Lovely home.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.439
And we should know because we sell
a lot of homes.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.400
High-end homes like this one.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.193
Oh, my God.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.029
[bell jingles]

09:32.905 --> 09:33.864
[exhales]

09:33.948 --> 09:38.244
Hello. I'm one half of a father-son
seafood distribution company.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.162
I'm the son. [chuckles]

09:41.414 --> 09:43.833
Anyway, my dad can't be here.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.211
Well, not that he's an absent father.
Far from it.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.256
We do a lot of things together--
tennis, word puzzles.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.301
Sometimes we just sit quietly
side by side, and that's all right, too.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.427
What do you want?

09:54.510 --> 09:57.096
Right, we want to be
your new seafood distributor.

09:57.179 --> 10:00.641
We could do it on a trial basis.
Maybe start with clams.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.892
Who sells you your clams?

10:02.351 --> 10:03.519
We don't serve a lot of clams.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.022
Maybe because you are swimming
with the wrong clammers.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.898
What'd you say
your clam guy's name was?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.400
Why do you keep bringing up clams?

10:09.692 --> 10:12.903
Am I? Because you're the one
who brought it up last.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.449
Listen, I'm not sure what's going on here,
but you should go.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.160
Understood. My father and I respect
your decision to stay with--

10:19.243 --> 10:21.287
who did you say your clam guy was?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.872
-Get out.
-Very good.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.206

10:28.377 --> 10:29.211
[sighs]

10:35.635 --> 10:36.969
Dare I?

10:43.142 --> 10:45.102
That corn dog smells really great.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.103
It's the last one.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.438
Fair enough.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.775
So, what Abby came to say was...

10:51.984 --> 10:54.195
Christian, I really am sorry...

10:55.404 --> 10:58.157
that something went so wrong
in your early relationships with women

10:58.240 --> 11:00.576
that you ended up being
such an irredeemable douchebag.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.703
-Abby.
-I've decided I don't need my iPad back.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.871
Phones have gotten big enough.

11:04.121 --> 11:08.459
If my relationships are so messed up,
then why did I have sex at age 13?

11:09.377 --> 11:10.211
Boom.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.590
Whoa. Buddy, there's a lot
to unpack there.

11:14.673 --> 11:19.095
Guys, let's stop with all the name-calling
and the unsettling sexual revelations

11:19.178 --> 11:22.765
and just get back to why we're here.
And, please, let's keep it civil.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.184
-[door opens]
-[woman] Ding-dong, we're home.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.352
Fuck me.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.399
-You two.
-Chris? Christa?

11:31.482 --> 11:32.983
Christian is your son?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.569
Oh, I see what you've done there. Wow.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.154
What are you doing in our house?

11:37.238 --> 11:40.157
Our daughter felt great remorse
for hitting your son with a tray

11:40.241 --> 11:41.575
and came to apologize.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.662
-She hit our son with a tray?
-Only in the face.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.038
-[gasps]
-I'm Abby.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.499
If you guys want to sell your home,
these two are the best.

11:48.582 --> 11:52.920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you okay? Did she hurt you?

11:53.003 --> 11:55.131
-Mom, I'm fine.
-You didn't know?

11:55.214 --> 11:58.092
Mom, Dr. Fineman says
you shouldn't squeeze my face anymore

11:58.175 --> 11:59.301
without my permission.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.720
-Dad!
-He did say that, sweetie.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.223
Well, sounds like we've triggered
a healthy discussion,

12:04.306 --> 12:05.349
so we're gonna scoot.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.186
-Why didn't the school call us?
-Because there wasn't any proof.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.063
But as proactive parents,
we felt compelled

12:11.147 --> 12:12.440
to have our daughter come and apologize,

12:12.523 --> 12:14.024
which I think we can all agree
has been done.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.235
Well, now there is proof, isn't there?

12:16.610 --> 12:18.946
I'm not following, and we have to scoot.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.116
You just admitted it.
Your daughter assaulted our son.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.453
And we're going to notify Principal Novak
and have her expelled.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.163
[Christa] Oh, this is delicious.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.459
You two came over here and told us
something we never would have known.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.295
And now we're going to strap it on
and fuck you with it.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.421
Go, Mom!

12:35.504 --> 12:38.299
Your daughter
is not going to graduate high school,

12:38.382 --> 12:40.426
which is ironic
because you two are the idiots.

12:40.509 --> 12:44.555
How would you like it if I put my foot
so far up your perfect little ass,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.391
you won't find it again until
you shit it out on Christmas morning?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.477
Go, Mom!

12:49.560 --> 12:52.021
Honey, remember why we're here--
trying to keep Abby on the right path.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.982
Let's not touch anyone in a way
Dr. Fineman wouldn't approve of.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.775
Sheila, what is your safe word?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
Because I want to know what to ignore
when I'm making you my bitch.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.615
You're just lucky that I'm here
to set an example for my daughter

13:02.698 --> 13:05.367
because otherwise,
I would literally turn you inside out.

13:05.659 --> 13:09.455
Look, let's take a breath.
We're all "realators" here.

13:09.538 --> 13:15.085
Actually, we're "realtors."
We don't know what a "real-ator" is.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.004
You know what, Chris? Fuck you.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.088
How about this?

13:18.172 --> 13:21.842
We won't tell Principal Novak
what Abby did and get her expelled

13:21.926 --> 13:24.762
if you give us the listing
you stole from us with that dog stunt.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.181
You are never gonna get that listing.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.058
And we didn't steal it. We won it.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.228
In high school,
your dad drove drunk and flipped a car.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.855
You have until 5:00 tonight to decide.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.774
That is our best and final offer.

13:37.650 --> 13:42.029
Oh, that's an expression "realtors" use,
so you may not be familiar with it.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.533
Christian, did you know that your mom
sold me a Quaalude once?

13:46.742 --> 13:50.371
Well, I think this has shown us
why everyone here has such fucked-up kids.

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
Shall we scoot?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.043
I hate these people. They're so mean.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.587
And this house.
A mudroom in Santa Clarita?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.799
-It rains twice a year. Fools.
-We cannot let them win this.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.717
Grace Tinsler got expelled,
and now she's homeschooled

14:03.801 --> 14:05.427
and has 200,000 YouTube followers.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.805
And all she does is whisper ingredients
from cereal boxes.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.725
You're not getting expelled.
And you're not-- what'd you say she does?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.103
She whispers ingredients into a camera.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.856
It's a non-sexual fetish thing.
It pays her parents' mortgage.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.401
If it pays her parents' mortgage,
it's a sex thing.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.777
Maybe we should give them the listing.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.696
No. We can't lose that commission.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.573
And even if we give them what they want,

14:25.656 --> 14:27.867
what's to keep them
from blackmailing us again?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.118
They may want our next listing.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.412
And then the one after that.
And then they'll own us.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.249
That's true. Like Dan. Maybe even worse.
He wanted us to kill for him.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.961
But to his credit, he never spoke
so explicitly about our bodies.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.005
Yeah, these people really belong
in a bigger city.

14:41.088 --> 14:45.175
Okay, we need to get ahead of this.
We need to get to Novak before they do.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.678
And then Abby can apologize
and show some remorse.

14:47.761 --> 14:48.679
I'm not sorry.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.222
Show some remorse, all right?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.683
You might get a slap on the wrist
and not expelled.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.603
It's what people do when they plead guilty
to get a lesser sentence.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.772
Murderers do it all the time.
I've been looking into it.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.442
I don't think it's a great idea
to just show up at his house.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.651
The last time we dropped by,

15:02.735 --> 15:04.486
we trashed it and assaulted
his grandmother.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.487
He might remember that.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.781
-You have a better idea?
-Yeah.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.451
Oh, better? [sighs] No.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.893
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

15:37.353 --> 15:38.812
This isn't the bathroom.

15:45.110 --> 15:45.945
[Sheila sighs]

15:46.028 --> 15:49.031
Novak better get home soon.
We have that investor meeting in an hour.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.033
Investor meeting.
Sounds important.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.118
Plus, it's 140 degrees in here,

15:53.202 --> 15:55.788
so let's bail and get food.

15:55.871 --> 15:56.997
Maybe a corn dog.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.917
That moment's passed.
Now I want sweets.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.294
No, we are staying here
until he gets home

16:02.378 --> 16:04.463
and you can say you're sorry
for what you did.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.131
-I'm not sorry.
-We don't care.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.466
You need to tell him that you are.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.343
Yeah, 'cause you don't want
Chris and Christa to win.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.803
Because we are overwhelmed

16:10.886 --> 16:13.681
and we don't know
if our family is going to make it!

16:16.308 --> 16:19.728
I'm sorry, but you always say
you want to be included in our world.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.105
That's our world.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.732
It's been really hard lately, sweetie.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.443
Every day something new
is thrown at us.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.278
Yesterday, I bit my finger off.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.363
What?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.824
It's okay, it's getting better.
I'm like a snowman.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.534
What?

16:33.617 --> 16:36.912
A year ago, losing a finger would've been
the headline of the Christmas newsletter.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.123
Now it wouldn't even be
in the "This 'n' That" section.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.917
And you hit someone in the face
with a tray and might get expelled,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.503
so we feel like we're failing you
as parents.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.587
[sighs]

16:47.756 --> 16:49.758
What do you mean we might not make it?

16:52.636 --> 16:56.098
Your mother and I will always
do everything to keep this family going.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.726
But right now,
we could really use your help.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.648
[vehicle approaching]

17:07.443 --> 17:09.153
[gasps] He's home.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.657
Principal Novak!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.119
Oh, God. It's all three of them.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.537
Ah!

17:19.329 --> 17:21.415
[gasps, pants]

17:24.793 --> 17:26.253
We just want to talk to you.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.505
Come on. [panting]

17:28.589 --> 17:31.050
Come on, come on, come on.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.968
What? What do you want from me?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.554
First of all, I hope you're okay.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.765
Second, thanks for not pressing charges

17:37.848 --> 17:40.142
after I broke some things
in your lovely home.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.520
I wanted to,
but my grandmother wouldn't allow it.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.190
It's her house,
so she always gets her way,

17:46.273 --> 17:48.942
right down to the flavor of sherbet
that I'm allowed to enjoy.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.486
Well, we're grateful either way.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.906
But the reason we're here is because
Abby has something to tell you.

17:53.989 --> 17:54.907
Right, Abby?

17:57.826 --> 18:00.829
-I did hit Christian with a tray.
-[chuckles] I knew it!

18:02.748 --> 18:04.792
I'm sorry for the trouble
I caused everyone.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.378
I didn't handle the situation
in the best way. It's just...

18:09.463 --> 18:12.883
when I saw Christian posting texts
from Janie and how humiliated she felt,

18:12.966 --> 18:14.593
I snapped.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.386
I had to do something.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.807
I had to help her.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.436
Okay, that's nonsense

18:24.520 --> 18:26.980
because there were 200 other people
in that cafeteria,

18:27.064 --> 18:28.899
and none of them did what you did.

18:29.650 --> 18:33.028
No, they didn't. And I accept
full responsibility for my actions.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.740
Thank you.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.868
Coming forward was the right
and correct thing to do.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.288
-Now you are expelled.
-What?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.041
-Hold on.
-I think you missed the point.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.919
-Our daughter--
-Is a hooligan, as you all are.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.088
And now she is expelled!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.465
And if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go inside

18:53.549 --> 18:55.217
and I'm gonna have two scoops of sherbet

18:55.300 --> 18:58.095
because my grandmother is away,
hopefully failing her driver's test.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.805
[Sheila] Well, wait.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.516
-Wait!
-Leave me be!

19:06.395 --> 19:09.773
Sorry, team. I failed.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.652
-You didn't fail, honey.
-No. You did great.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.988
What are you talking about?
I got expelled.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.532
There were 200 kids in that cafeteria,

19:18.615 --> 19:22.786
and you were the only one
that did anything to help that poor girl.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.372
-Maybe it wasn't the best thing.
-Yeah, don't do that again.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.791
-But you did something.
-That's right.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.670
Maybe we're not raising a monster.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.755
Maybe we're raising a superhero.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.009
Wait, you thought I was a monster?

19:37.092 --> 19:38.510
Shh.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.429
Shit!

19:40.512 --> 19:41.346
Wow!

19:42.055 --> 19:43.807
Your finger's gone. Where'd it go?

19:44.057 --> 19:47.394
-I don't know. I had it in the car.
-Think it fell off in the yard?

19:47.477 --> 19:48.437
[Novak screams]

19:51.565 --> 19:54.359
Now I'm guessing
Novak slammed it in the door.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.155
-Maybe we should go.
-I want my finger.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.909
I know, but it's gonna be so awkward.
We already said goodbye.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.619
Yeah. I want my finger.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.370
I know, I know. Damn it!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.039
Hold on.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.459
I have an idea.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.215
[Sheila screaming]

20:16.882 --> 20:18.008
My finger!

20:19.259 --> 20:20.844
You cut off my wife's finger!

20:20.928 --> 20:23.138
This is an emergency!
There's no time to think!

20:23.222 --> 20:26.683
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
-Oh, my God. I'm in so much pain!

20:26.767 --> 20:29.311
-Quickly, to the hospital.
-I'm so sorry! Please don't sue me!

20:31.939 --> 20:34.233
We won't if you don't expel Abby.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.611
Yes. Otherwise, you'll be hearing
from the law offices of Martin L. Taylor.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.656
All right. All right.
Let's say three days of suspension.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.324
We can live with that.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.993
-I'll get some ice for your finger.
-That's okay. This will work.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.454
My sherbet. My spoon.

20:51.375 --> 20:55.128
Suck it, Chris and Christa!
Our daughter's getting suspended.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.589
The Hammonds, taking a step forward!

20:57.673 --> 21:00.175
-Abby, getting her iPad back!
-[phone ringing]

21:00.259 --> 21:02.844
Eric, programming his picture
into my phone.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.805
Nobody wants that.

21:04.888 --> 21:05.722
Hey, buddy.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.932
I messed up, Joel.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.184
I went to Japopo's
to try to find the clam distributor

21:09.268 --> 21:11.728
and I snuck into the owner's office
and he saw me and got pissed.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.355
Now I'm locked in here
and I can't get out.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.399
-Why did you go there?
<i>-Because you were busy.</i>

21:15.482 --> 21:17.276
I wanted to help you.
I love being helpful.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.403
All right, I'll be right over.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.613
Please tell me that I don't have
to pretend we're partners

21:21.697 --> 21:23.532
in a father-son seafood business.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.868
Oh, Jesus.

21:28.036 --> 21:28.912
I have to go help Eric.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.998
It's almost 4:00.
We have that investor meeting.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.333
Plus, Mom's finger came off.
That seems important.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.378
Right. Okay.
We have a lot of knives in the air.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.424
As wise jugglers, "We must each focus on
but a single blade."

21:40.507 --> 21:42.926
I think Dad spent too much time
in a hot car.

21:43.010 --> 21:43.885
No, he's fine.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.513
He just saw something on television,
and now he's living his life by it.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.975
Abby, help your mother
reattach her finger. It's not that hard.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.186
-Gross. Got it.
-I'll deal with the Eric situation.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.771
And Carl's not gonna be
at that meeting, right?

21:54.855 --> 21:57.774
Nope. So I won't be stressed
and start snacking on myself.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.819
-I'll just go on my own.
-Great!

22:00.902 --> 22:03.405
The Hammonds, getting shit done!

22:03.488 --> 22:06.199
The Hammonds, making it look easy.

22:06.283 --> 22:10.162
The Hammonds, standing for too long
with a severed finger in the street.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.997
Yeah, we should go.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.378
Hey, Mark.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.131
Joel!
Hey, thanks for that Yelp review, buddy.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.382
Brought in a bunch of new customers.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.468
How's that tipping documentary
coming, huh?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.803
My wife, she bought a beautiful new dress
for the interview.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.305
Oh. [sighs]

22:28.388 --> 22:30.599
I lost the financing.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.895
So, unless you know anyone
who's got $2 million... [chuckles]

22:34.978 --> 22:36.855
Actually, I do know a guy.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.857
Oh. Um...

22:39.357 --> 22:42.944
Anyway, I'm also part of a father-son
seafood distribution company

22:43.028 --> 22:45.322
-and, apparently, my boy--
-Whoa.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.741
Is that your son in my office?
That's him?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.868
What the hell's going on here, hmm?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.870
There's no way you and that kid
are seafood distributors.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.165
No, we're not.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.001
Well, at least tell me
you're really making a tipping documentary

22:58.085 --> 22:58.919
my wife's gonna be in.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.256
God damn it.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.425
Sorry, Mark, it's complicated.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.929
But, please,
I promise I'll never lie to you again

23:09.012 --> 23:11.431
if you'll just let my only son
out of your office.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.601
Let him out? He can go whenever he wants.
He locked himself in there.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.727
-What?
-Yeah.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.939
[sighs]

23:20.816 --> 23:22.984
Eric. Open the door.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.991
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. He yelled, I panicked.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.994
The longer I was in here,
the angrier he got. [sighs]

23:33.078 --> 23:36.581
I'm a coward, Joel. Behold.
The me behind the mask.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.001
You pissed off the owner.
Now he's never gonna help me.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.920
Sorry, humankind, can't save you.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.673
Eric went rogue,
so everyone has to eat each other.

23:44.923 --> 23:49.678
Actually, maybe they won't.
I found this in the file cabinet.

23:50.512 --> 23:54.391
Japopo's has a regular seafood
distributor, but the day Sheila got sick,

23:54.474 --> 23:58.395
for some reason,
they bought their clams from this place.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.564
"Ruby's Clams."

24:00.647 --> 24:01.940
Oh, my God, this is it.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.442
This is where the clams
that turned Sheila came from.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.944
You found it, Eric.

24:10.198 --> 24:13.952
-Did you want me to hug you?
-No, we don't have to hug.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.289
That's right. We're men of the sea.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.208
Sometimes we just walk quietly
side by side.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.543
That's all right, too.

24:21.918 --> 24:22.878
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

24:26.798 --> 24:27.632
[whispers] Okay.

24:29.885 --> 24:33.096
Carl!
I thought you weren't coming.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.683
I changed my mind. I wanted to make sure
you didn't fuck it up.

24:36.766 --> 24:37.684
[chuckles]

24:37.767 --> 24:42.272
Okay, well, I'll be in in a minute.
I just need to put some lipstick on.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.440
You look fine.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.151
Yeah, okay.

24:50.864 --> 24:51.698
Oh.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.410
Carl, you parked a little close.
Would you mind?

24:55.493 --> 24:58.622
Hurry up! And don't talk too much.
You sound like a know-it-all.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.501
[sighs] No.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.629
Where's that stress ball?

25:08.715 --> 25:10.258
Okay.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.178
I can do this.

25:14.596 --> 25:15.972
I can do this.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.767
I can do this.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.854
[exhales]

25:23.855 --> 25:24.731
-[Joel] Honey!
-[gasps]

25:25.941 --> 25:28.777
-What's going on?
-I'm going to that investor meeting.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.154
It's 4:00 a.m. That was 12 hours ago!

25:31.238 --> 25:33.990
I've been looking everywhere for you!
Where have you been?

25:34.074 --> 25:36.952
I don't know.
The last thing I remember is...

25:37.035 --> 25:38.995
I was parking and then Carl pulled up,

25:39.079 --> 25:41.748
and then I had to grab my stress ball
and started squeezing it--

25:41.831 --> 25:43.083
-[gasps]
-[gasps]

25:44.751 --> 25:45.919
Oh, shit!

25:47.796 --> 25:49.089
Carl?
