I should be drinking tea.

09:59.173 --> 10:02.017

10:02.176 --> 10:07.188
He thinks I'm just this
combative person who, you know,

Just like a--that's how I am.

10:10.443 --> 10:15.271
So we have this meeting hoping
that Dr. Pepper can help us.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.616
And one thing
that she asked him was,

10:17.775 --> 10:20.702
you know,
based on the negatives,

10:20.861 --> 10:22.704
like is it just this one thing,

10:22.788 --> 10:26.115

when you are in conflict?

positives. He's like, "Yeah."

10:31.047 --> 10:32.547

10:32.632 --> 10:34.290
"Michaela, you know,
there's problem, right?"

10:34.375 --> 10:36.125

and I wanna get rid of it.

10:43.559 --> 10:46.394

makes us do this task

10:46.553 --> 10:48.137
where we have to hold hands

10:48.230 --> 10:49.981
and say that we'll talk

that I was hungry.

11:05.989 --> 11:10.502

"You're hungry? Wanna go eat?"

Oh.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.342

the other person was saying.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.004

to be back with Zack

no production crew?

12:12.973 --> 12:14.482

for you guys?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.893

been within a week's time--

12:30.666 --> 12:37.505
From, you know, my husband just
not talking to me whatsoever,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.832
to come ask me to spend
the night and then being like,

12:39.917 --> 12:41.250
"Hey, you know what?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.418
Let's have these conversations,"

12:42.511 --> 12:45.338
and kind of trying
to figure it out.

12:45.422 --> 12:46.506
- But now it's
Decision Day time.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.433
- It's Decision Day time.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.926

12:50.010 --> 12:51.594

really think

12:54.014 --> 12:55.181
about my ultimate Decision Day.

12:55.265 --> 12:57.183
- Okay.

12:57.267 --> 13:00.445
- I don't know if Zack
is leading her on.

13:00.604 --> 13:03.105
I don't know if Zack
is leading himself on.

13:03.190 --> 13:07.276
I don't know that Zack
exactly knows what Zack wants.

13:07.361 --> 13:09.120
And so I think he also needs
to have a sit down with himself

13:09.279 --> 13:10.538
and really figure out
what he feels

13:10.697 --> 13:12.281

14:23.028 --> 14:25.113

disappointing though,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.123
is the only dissenting opinion
that he got

14:44.207 --> 14:46.301
that validated his feelings

14:46.385 --> 14:48.052
was from my best friend.
From Sarah.

14:48.211 --> 14:49.470

- You know,
when we had that disagreement,

19:49.179 --> 19:53.107
it took a while for, like,
me to get an apology.

19:53.266 --> 19:55.776
So I'm kind of curious as to

19:55.861 --> 19:58.279
when that next time's gonna
come, when I'm gonna wait,

19:58.438 --> 19:59.855
am I gonna wait for an apology?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.700
Or will he be like,
"No, I'm sorry."

20:02.784 --> 20:04.860
- I think there's a disconnect
there with him,

20:04.945 --> 20:08.697
with him not being so readily
able to say I'm sorry to you.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.709
Just keep his [bleep]
accountable.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.377
What you do today sets precedent

20:13.462 --> 20:14.536
for what happens tomorrow.

20:14.621 --> 20:16.380
If you let him off today,

20:16.539 --> 20:17.632
who's to say
he's gonna think it's okay?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.292
- Yeah. And his way of showing

20:20.377 --> 20:23.638
that he was ready
to grow from it

20:23.722 --> 20:25.547
was him making these note cards.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.974
- What's written
on these note cards?

20:27.133 --> 20:29.977
- "I promise
to actively listen more."

20:30.136 --> 20:32.146
"I promise to be
less controlling

20:32.305 --> 20:34.390
and let you be the independent
woman you are always."

20:34.483 --> 20:36.067
"I promise to always check on
my wife

20:36.151 --> 20:38.152
morning, noon, and night."

20:38.237 --> 20:40.145
That sounds controlling,
but maybe it isn't.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.406
[laughter]

20:42.491 --> 20:44.575
- Okay, so one note card
is the locking.

"I promise never to, like,
deadbolt the lock."

Hell, yeah, it is.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.219
It's definitely
been a hell of a ride.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.055
You know, for me, I think
there's a lot of questions

24:35.140 --> 24:37.641
that I've already have
the answers to,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.059
but there's, uh--there's some
things

24:39.144 --> 24:40.719
that I still don't have
answers to.

24:40.803 --> 24:42.313
You know, I have my pros,
I have my cons.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.056
And so, you know,
a lot of the pros

24:44.140 --> 24:46.558
are just basically,
she's a sports fan.

24:46.643 --> 24:48.393
Great teammates, you know,
I'll cook, she'll clean.

24:48.478 --> 24:50.312
You know,
it's a very great tandem.

24:50.396 --> 24:51.906
There's a lot
that we're still learning,

24:52.065 --> 24:54.566
there's little disagreements
that we still have, but those--

24:54.651 --> 24:56.494
You know, we overcome those,
like, very quickly.

24:56.653 --> 24:58.746
At this point,
it's very, very good.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.915
It's a little thing she does,
the details.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.666
She's like, "Oh, hey,
well, you know,

25:02.825 --> 25:04.585
you don't have a lunch,
I got it for you."

25:04.744 --> 25:07.421
It's little things like that.
So you know, it's reciprocal.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.499
And it's good, man.
It's really good.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.009
- What would be say, you know,
three reasons

25:12.093 --> 25:15.587
why you wouldn't stay?

25:15.672 --> 25:18.840
- It's just her being faithful
with--for me, being, you know,

25:18.925 --> 25:23.187
primarily number one reason
for me to say no.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.440
Communication would be
number two.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.360
You know, we had some issues
early on and so she was like,

25:29.444 --> 25:30.694
"You know what,
I'm out of here."

25:30.853 --> 25:33.197
You called me
by a different man's name.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.942
- And I immediately apologized,
but you locked me out.

25:37.026 --> 25:40.454
I don't feel that you
are remorseful at all,

25:40.613 --> 25:44.041
and I cannot be your wife.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.292
- And it was like, okay.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.203
I was like,
"Wow, okay, that quick."

25:48.288 --> 25:50.881
And so, you know, for me,
I wanted a team player.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.624
I wanted someone
that's gonna be a partner,

25:52.717 --> 25:54.960
someone that's gonna be in
for it for the long haul.

25:55.044 --> 25:57.296
So the question came up
of, you know, "Hey, that night,

25:57.389 --> 26:01.800
unfortunately, you know,
where did you sleep?"

26:01.893 --> 26:05.304
So she was like, "Well,
I slept at an ex's house."

26:05.388 --> 26:07.556
Like, okay.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.308
- So yeah, that's pretty big

26:09.392 --> 26:12.570
because, you know, y'all were...

26:12.729 --> 26:14.655
y'all were trying to build
something.

26:14.739 --> 26:17.649
And for her to kind of go back
to her past,

26:17.742 --> 26:19.901
it's kind of big for me.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.414
- And clearly, I mean,
when she told me,

26:23.498 --> 26:27.826
I wasn't the most happiest and
joyous about hearing that news.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.579
But she did, you know,
give me the confirmation of,

26:30.663 --> 26:32.923
hey, you know, nothing happened
and X, Y, and Z.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.833
And so, you know,
I rode with that.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.928
But, you know,
it's all I can go with off of,

26:38.087 --> 26:41.432

26:41.516 --> 26:43.342

26:43.426 --> 26:45.269
So yeah, keep your eyes open.

26:45.353 --> 26:49.014
But you just got to make the
right decision for yourself.

26:49.098 --> 26:50.432

Compromise.

So I feel like
if she's not willing to change

49:51.646 --> 49:54.824
for the right reasons,
that would make me say no.

- [laughs]

50:14.761 --> 50:16.503
- Yeah, um,

50:16.588 --> 50:19.506
I think the general reason
to say yes on Decision Day

50:19.591 --> 50:22.101
is that you have
mutual feelings,

50:22.260 --> 50:25.604
you have a connection, you have
chemistry, you have respect.

50:25.689 --> 50:28.024
And the reason to say no
is you don't have any of that.

50:28.108 --> 50:31.861
And that's my mentality
going into Decision Day.

50:32.020 --> 50:33.195
- I went through this
whole thing

50:33.280 --> 50:36.106
just trusting my feelings,

50:36.191 --> 50:37.950
waiting for feelings,
expecting feelings,

50:38.035 --> 50:40.119
and I'm gonna continue
to do that.

50:40.203 --> 50:46.033
I've been very honest
to myself about everything.

50:46.126 --> 50:49.536
And I'm gonna just,
I'm gonna keep doing that.

50:49.621 --> 50:51.038
- I mean, we all grown.

50:51.131 --> 50:52.798
You should know
what you really want.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.217
And so whether it's to stay
or not to say,

50:55.302 --> 50:57.044
there's another person involved,

50:57.128 --> 50:58.888
and you got
to consider them as well.

50:58.972 --> 51:00.214
The best thing you can do
for them

51:00.307 --> 51:01.474
is tell them
exactly what you want.

51:01.558 --> 51:04.134

- Come on, coach.

51:09.057 --> 51:10.649
- Um,

51:10.734 --> 51:14.144
the way that I would say
yes on Decision Day,

51:14.229 --> 51:20.159
is if I saw some potential,

51:20.243 --> 51:22.578
might as well give it a shot.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.413
Yes or no on Decision Day,

51:24.572 --> 51:28.158
just keep hanging out
and see what happens.

51:28.243 --> 51:31.170
Might be surprised.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.755
- You never know.

51:32.839 --> 51:35.082
- It really does take two people

51:35.166 --> 51:39.428
to start the marriage,
to sustain the marriage.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.931
But it just takes one person
to end the marriage.

51:42.090 --> 51:47.520
And for me going into this,
I came in 100%.

51:47.679 --> 51:50.681
I was looking for my forever.
I was hoping to fall in love.

51:50.774 --> 51:51.941
I was hoping this is it.

51:52.100 --> 51:54.527
And when I committed
to doing this,

51:54.611 --> 51:58.364
it took a lot for me
because I'm just not--

51:58.523 --> 52:00.357
I'm not somebody
that takes big risks.

52:00.450 --> 52:04.361
I'm not somebody
that puts myself out there.

52:04.445 --> 52:07.456
I got matched with Johnny,
and he challenged me.

52:07.541 --> 52:12.378
And in many ways he challenged
me to be a better person.

52:12.462 --> 52:16.623
And so Decision Day,
while it might seem arbitrary,

52:16.716 --> 52:20.127
I feel like it's not,
because saying no

52:20.211 --> 52:25.132
is really an announcement
that someone's out.

52:25.216 --> 52:27.226

53:07.017 --> 53:09.018
why can't it be a yes

53:09.102 --> 53:11.937
and then decide no concretely
after you've given it a chance?

53:12.096 --> 53:15.274
- Right. Because like I said,
if I were to say yes,

53:15.358 --> 53:16.609
then that is me saying

53:22.365 --> 53:23.866
That's what that means to me.

53:24.025 --> 53:26.944
A yes may not mean that
for you guys, but if I say yes,

53:27.028 --> 53:29.947
that means this eight weeks
have been great, I'm happy,

53:30.031 --> 53:32.374
and let's continue.

53:32.533 --> 53:36.295

I mean, for it to be a no,

53:36.379 --> 53:37.713
I really don't think,
emotionally,

53:37.797 --> 53:39.539
I can come back from that.

53:39.624 --> 53:42.459
If it's a yes and it ends up
being a no later, fine.

53:42.543 --> 53:44.378
But a yes to me is like,
all right,

53:44.462 --> 53:46.713
it might be [bleep] right now,
but we can work on it.

53:46.798 --> 53:49.225
And I see potential
in this, and it--

53:49.384 --> 53:51.143
And let's just see
where it goes.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.638
I reflect on the possibility
that I might say yes,

53:54.722 --> 53:57.140
and Johnny says no,
and that's it for me.

53:57.225 --> 53:59.985
For me a no is like,
I'm done with this.

54:00.144 --> 54:01.728
I would be checked out.

54:01.821 --> 54:06.325
- So if Johnny says like,
"I just had to say no

54:06.409 --> 54:08.986
"because where I'm at mentally,

54:09.079 --> 54:11.247
physically, it's just like,
I need to get back to myself,"

54:11.406 --> 54:13.666
whatever reason,
he says, right, but he's like,

54:13.750 --> 54:16.752
"But I promise you, Bao,
like I do wanna work on us.

54:16.836 --> 54:18.170
"And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

54:18.255 --> 54:20.339
to see how we can kind of make
this work later on."

54:20.423 --> 54:21.581
So you would still say--

54:21.675 --> 54:22.675
- Then it's a yes
without saying it.

54:22.834 --> 54:23.834
- Then you would say yes.

54:23.918 --> 54:26.837
I mean, Zack's a smart guy.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.348
<i>I would never discount
his intelligence.</i>

54:29.432 --> 54:33.269
But I still don't understand
Zack's line of logic.

54:33.428 --> 54:35.020
I can't help but feel
like he's thinking

54:35.179 --> 54:37.356
<i>about walking into Decision Day</i>

54:37.440 --> 54:40.017

54:46.700 --> 54:49.526
Like, that doesn't make
any sense to me.

54:49.610 --> 54:52.955
- If I may, Bao, because Zack
and I had this conversation

54:53.039 --> 54:54.781
about what I thought a no meant.

54:54.866 --> 54:58.618
And, yes, a "no" to me
was a rejection,

54:58.703 --> 55:02.289
and that rejection
equaled humiliation to me.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.207
And that's why
I didn't want a no,

55:04.292 --> 55:06.468
and that's why I didn't wanna
understand his no.

55:06.553 --> 55:08.378
And at this point,
it's like, you know,

55:12.216 --> 55:16.219
It's like, okay, well,

55:16.304 --> 55:18.230
But I completely understand
that shut-down, Bao,

55:18.315 --> 55:21.725

it's, you know, it's a thing.

55:30.243 --> 55:32.069

to not just say,

55:35.415 --> 55:38.158

57:15.932 --> 57:17.924

because I was hoping

57:18.017 --> 57:21.344
that I would find
my forever person.

57:21.429 --> 57:24.356
<i>But I've gained a lot more
than a husband and a marriage.</i>

57:24.441 --> 57:27.601
I've gained some beautiful
friendships that I want

for the rest of my life.

57:32.190 --> 57:35.442

speaking for themselves,

57:35.526 --> 57:37.360
do--have you learned something
about yourself

57:37.454 --> 57:39.288
that you didn't know,
before coming into this?

57:39.372 --> 57:40.947
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:41.032 --> 57:43.783
- One of the main things
is that I set out

57:43.868 --> 57:47.037
to have like a really,
really, really open mind.

57:47.130 --> 57:50.716
And then when I was faced
with that, I did it.

57:50.800 --> 57:54.470
And I wasn't sure that
I would be able to and I did.

57:54.554 --> 57:57.464
- For me, it's just in the past
to me an argument

57:57.557 --> 58:00.050
equals a breakup, you know?

58:00.134 --> 58:03.720
And I had a severe argument
with someone,

58:03.813 --> 58:06.890
and I decided not to break up
with the person.

58:06.983 --> 58:12.237
And I continued, and it worked
out even for the better.

58:12.396 --> 58:13.655
- Going into this marriage,

58:13.814 --> 58:18.068
I feel like I embodied
a lot more patience

58:18.161 --> 58:20.654
than I thought I could
give myself credit for.

58:20.747 --> 58:24.991
And I've tried really hard

58:25.076 --> 58:27.994
to work on being more kind
in this relationship

58:28.087 --> 58:32.666
than I have
in past relationships.

58:32.750 --> 58:35.418
- Um, one thing I've learned
about myself

58:35.503 --> 58:37.420
throughout this entire process

58:37.505 --> 58:40.924
is I always thought I was like
the real calm, cool, chill,

58:41.017 --> 58:46.188
even-keel kinda--kind of guy.
- Oh, I did too.

58:46.347 --> 58:47.847
- And going through
this process,

58:47.932 --> 58:50.517
I've realized
I'm an emotional wreck.

58:50.601 --> 58:52.110
[laughter]

58:52.195 --> 58:54.354
- Johnny!
- Hey, but that's important.

58:54.438 --> 58:57.023
That's extremely important
to know that.

58:57.108 --> 58:59.451
- Being faced with
like real hardship,

58:59.536 --> 59:04.456
which I've always
run from in the past.

59:04.615 --> 59:07.960
Being forced to like stay
and rough it and experience it

59:08.044 --> 59:10.954
and encounter like emotions
you never felt before

59:11.038 --> 59:11.880
and like
immediately talk about it.

59:12.039 --> 59:13.707
- Mm-hmm.

59:13.791 --> 59:15.551
- Yeah, I would
piggyback off of Johnny.

59:15.635 --> 59:18.804
Like, you know, I thought
I was cool, calm and collected.

59:18.963 --> 59:21.631
I've honestly cried more times
during this whole process

59:21.716 --> 59:25.561
than I have my entire
27 years of living.

59:25.720 --> 59:27.637
And then, you know,
I definitely thought

59:27.730 --> 59:29.982
my critical reasoning skills
were top notch,

59:30.066 --> 59:31.733
but um, you know, kind of
going through this process

59:31.892 --> 59:35.571
and with Michaela,
specifically, you know,

59:35.730 --> 59:37.489
I've learned like thinking
a different way,

59:37.574 --> 59:38.907
and I think it's a good way so.

59:39.066 --> 59:40.492
- Wow.
- That's thanks to Michaela.

59:40.651 --> 59:43.662
- All right.
- Yeah.

59:43.821 --> 59:46.999
- The one thing I would say
that I learned about myself

59:47.158 --> 59:49.159
during this process is that

59:49.252 --> 59:55.165
Um, I'm able to be vulnerable
with somebody to an extent.

59:55.258 --> 59:57.834
I never--I've never been
vulnerable with somebody,

59:57.918 --> 1:00:00.846
I've always wanted to,
to kind of feel free

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:02.431
and so I feel like, you know,

1:00:02.590 --> 1:00:05.434
going through this,
it's possible.

1:00:05.593 --> 1:00:07.510
I feel like it's possible
for anybody.

1:00:07.604 --> 1:00:09.763
It's just, you've gotta find
the right person.

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:14.684
But you also have
to be able to, you know,

1:00:14.777 --> 1:00:16.361
give them that trust,
you know what I'm saying?

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:18.188
And then, you know,

1:00:18.272 --> 1:00:21.691
it might bite you in the butt,
but you can't think of that.

1:00:21.776 --> 1:00:23.109
You've just got
to let it happen,

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:25.362
and then go from there though.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:27.364
- I maybe really feel like
starting any relationship

1:00:27.448 --> 1:00:30.950
you can't go in
not expecting to get hurt.

1:00:31.035 --> 1:00:33.036
- Yeah,
if you put yourself out there,

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:35.372
you have to expect that
it's not gonna be reciprocal,

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:36.956
and maybe you might get hurt.
- I may happen.

when it comes down to women,

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:29.184
