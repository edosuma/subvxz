00:01.867 --> 00:03.469
<i>- Tonight,
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:05.671
<i>touches down in Philadelphia.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:07.339
<i>- I traveled to the big city
of Philadelphia</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:08.941
<i>to prove a point.</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:11.943
I can do anything
the young folks can do.

00:11.946 --> 00:15.047
<i>- It's known as the
City of Brotherly Love.</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:18.117
<i>- My twin brother's like having
a built-in best friend.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:19.551
We're always there
for each other.

00:19.553 --> 00:23.155
<i>- And it's also known
for its fighting spirit.</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:24.790
<i>- Philly is the underdog city,</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.425
people
who will stick behind you,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.594
<i>just never giving up.</i>

00:28.596 --> 00:30.996
<i>- I want people to know that
you can be on your deathbed</i>

00:30.998 --> 00:33.832
and you can come back better
than you were before.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.335
<i>- And in a city with such
a rich history,</i>

00:36.337 --> 00:38.470
<i>tonight's competitors
are looking to make</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:39.972
<i>some history of their own.</i>

00:41.475 --> 00:43.108
<i>- I made it to Stage 2
as a rookie.</i>

00:43.110 --> 00:44.743
<i>In my second year,
I made it to Stage 3.</i>

00:44.745 --> 00:46.745
So there's only one more,
right?

00:46.747 --> 00:50.482
- I see you, Joe Moravsky!
- I see you!

00:51.485 --> 00:52.584
I want to get into
the history books.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.819
I want to be
an American ninja warrior.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.255
<i>- Geoff Britten did it!</i>

00:56.257 --> 00:58.023
<i>- I hit six buzzers in a row.</i>

00:58.025 --> 01:01.460
<i>- The first
American Ninja Warrior!</i>

01:01.462 --> 01:03.095
- It would be a dream
to hit 12 in a row.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.171
<i>- Welcome to the City
of Brotherly Love,</i>

01:12.173 --> 01:14.373
<i>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,</i>

01:14.375 --> 01:17.009
<i>our fifth destination
as we travel the nation</i>

01:17.011 --> 01:20.813
<i>to find the next
American ninja warrior.</i>

01:20.815 --> 01:22.214
Hello, everyone.
I'm Matt Iseman,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.749
here as always with
my partner,

01:23.751 --> 01:26.385
former NFL defensive
end Akbar Gbajabiamila.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.487
- Well, Matt, it is
our first time in Philly,

01:28.489 --> 01:31.156
and we are all the way
live in the 215.

01:31.158 --> 01:34.460
And these fans are louder
than the Liberty Bell.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.628
<i>- As you can see,
we built our course</i>

01:36.630 --> 01:38.931
<i>right outside the old
Richmond power plant,</i>

01:38.933 --> 01:41.300
<i>which was built
almost 100 years ago</i>

01:41.302 --> 01:43.735
<i>and served this city
for six decades.</i>

01:43.737 --> 01:45.437
But tonight,
if you want to advance

01:45.439 --> 01:47.139
to the city finals and beyond,

01:47.141 --> 01:49.108
you're gonna have
to generate your own power.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.343
- And you know, it's so fitting
that we are at a power plant,

01:51.345 --> 01:54.680
because these athletes
are going to be electric.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.381
<i>It starts with Geoff Britten.</i>

01:56.383 --> 01:58.417
<i>Last year, he climbed
Stage 4 in Vegas</i>

01:58.419 --> 02:00.819
<i>to become the first
American ninja warrior.</i>

02:00.821 --> 02:03.088
<i>- Geoff Britten did it!</i>

02:03.090 --> 02:06.091
<i>- Plus another guy who could
win it all this year...</i>

02:06.093 --> 02:07.726
- Yeah!

02:07.728 --> 02:09.895
<i>- The Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

02:09.896 --> 02:12.197
<i>And we've got a strong
group of women,</i>

02:12.199 --> 02:14.299
<i>led by one of the top
female competitors</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.835
<i>of all time, Michelle Warnky.</i>

02:16.837 --> 02:20.038
<i>- Get it!
- Yeah, she's done it!</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:22.174
- For more on the obstacles
they'll be facing,

02:22.176 --> 02:24.209
let's go down
to Kristine Leahy.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.344
- Thanks, Matt.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.678
Tonight, the ninjas will be
faced with a few

02:26.680 --> 02:27.813
challenging new obstacles

02:27.815 --> 02:29.915
on this Philadelphia
qualifying course.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.751
As in every city, it starts
with the new first obstacle,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.353
the Floating Steps,

02:34.355 --> 02:37.222
<i>where ninjas must run
across five angled platforms,</i>

02:37.224 --> 02:41.093
<i>each increasingly higher,
before swinging to safety.</i>

02:41.095 --> 02:42.661
<i>On the Log Grip, competitors</i>

02:42.663 --> 02:46.031
<i>will cling to the log
and slide down 25 feet,</i>

02:46.033 --> 02:49.201
<i>enduring two jolting
drops along the way.</i>

02:49.203 --> 02:50.602
<i>The Paddle Boards
will test their balance</i>

02:50.604 --> 02:53.372
<i>as they run across a series
of tilting paddles</i>

02:53.374 --> 02:55.541
<i>supported by a center axis.</i>

02:55.543 --> 02:58.443
<i>On the Wall Drop, athletes must
work their way up to the wall</i>

02:58.445 --> 03:00.145
<i>before jumping on a trampoline,</i>

03:00.147 --> 03:02.948
<i>wrapping around one
of the two hanging tubes,</i>

03:02.950 --> 03:04.683
<i>and swinging to safety.</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:06.919
<i>Making its debut tonight,
Rolling Thunder.</i>

03:06.921 --> 03:09.154
<i>Competitors must rotate
a metal wheel</i>

03:09.156 --> 03:10.989
<i>across 26 feet of track</i>

03:10.991 --> 03:14.593
<i>with two drops before swinging
for the landing platform.</i>

03:14.595 --> 03:17.362
Finally, competitors will face
the iconic Warped Wall,

03:17.364 --> 03:20.499
measuring 14 feet,
6 inches this year.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.768
<i>If they make it past
all six obstacles,</i>

03:22.770 --> 03:24.903
<i>they're heading to
the Philadelphia finals.</i>

03:24.905 --> 03:26.471
Guys.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.739
<i>- And for an insider's look</i>

03:27.741 --> 03:30.209
<i>at the secrets
of the Philadelphia course,</i>

03:30.211 --> 03:32.544
<i>check out the NBC
digital exclusive</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:33.912
<i>"Crashing the Course"</i>

03:33.914 --> 03:37.082
<i>at
facebook.com/NBCNinjaWarrior.</i>

03:37.084 --> 03:39.985
<i>- Well, our first athlete
is guaranteed</i>

03:39.987 --> 03:41.753
<i>to put a smile on your face.</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:44.389
<i>This is Clint Sarion
from Columbus, New Jersey.</i>

03:44.391 --> 03:46.325
<i>He had a life-threatening
brain tumor</i>

03:46.327 --> 03:49.461
<i>and, when he survived,
it changed his outlook on life.</i>

03:49.463 --> 03:51.530
<i>He now tries to spread
a positive message</i>

03:51.532 --> 03:54.466
<i>and calls himself
the Smiling Ninja.</i>

03:54.468 --> 03:56.134
<i>And he's got his wife
and two kids here,</i>

03:56.136 --> 03:58.570
<i>plus a big group
of smiling supporters.</i>

03:58.572 --> 04:02.407
<i>And he's gonna get us
started here in Philly.</i>

04:02.409 --> 04:05.277
<i>Clint Sarion,
a 43-year-old rookie.</i>

04:05.279 --> 04:07.346
<i>He got a pass to
the Movement Lab Ninja Gym</i>

04:07.348 --> 04:11.216
<i>for his 42nd birthday,
and he got hooked.</i>

04:11.218 --> 04:13.452
<i>One year later,
he's here on our course.</i>

04:13.454 --> 04:17.055
<i>- Ooh, having a little trouble
on the rope...</i>

04:17.057 --> 04:21.293
<i>got it!
And of course, he's smiling.</i>

04:21.295 --> 04:24.196
<i>- Now the 24-foot ride
on the Log Grip.</i>

04:24.198 --> 04:27.332
<i>Pulling up his shirt up
for traction.</i>

04:27.334 --> 04:28.900
<i>This is an
interesting technique.</i>

04:28.902 --> 04:30.802
<i>A lot of people
feel you get better contact</i>

04:30.804 --> 04:32.771
<i>on the log with pure skin
as opposed to the shirt.</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:35.440
<i>- That's it... body contact.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:38.944
<i>- And the Smiling Ninja is
moving on to the Paddle Boards.</i>

04:40.314 --> 04:43.448
<i>- And this is a tough
obstacle... 18 feet across,</i>

04:43.450 --> 04:45.517
<i>and you better move quick.</i>

04:45.519 --> 04:46.752
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

04:46.754 --> 04:49.121
<i>Oh, barely!
Iconic!</i>

04:49.123 --> 04:53.659
<i>- He is still smiling.
- Look at this.</i>

04:53.661 --> 04:57.029
<i>- Well, an impressive run
by our first athlete.</i>

04:57.031 --> 04:59.464
<i>This is a guy who had
a golf-ball-sized tumor,</i>

04:59.466 --> 05:01.099
<i>thought he was going to die.</i>

05:01.101 --> 05:04.369
<i>And now here he is,
taking on the fourth obstacle.</i>

05:04.371 --> 05:06.672
<i>- And Matt, this is a new one,
the Wall Drop,</i>

05:06.674 --> 05:08.340
<i>and let me tell you,
it's a beast.</i>

05:08.342 --> 05:10.776
<i>Has to use his upper body
to climb up to the top</i>

05:10.778 --> 05:13.412
<i>of that wall, then jump down
onto the trampoline.</i>

05:13.414 --> 05:17.316
<i>- Look at that... just
fighting his way up there.</i>

05:17.318 --> 05:20.118
<i>- He's still smiling, Matt.
- Well, there's a sudden impact</i>

05:20.120 --> 05:22.154
<i>when you drop down
onto this trampoline,</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:23.455
<i>so watch the legs.</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:26.191
<i>Watch how he controls
that impact, Akbar.</i>

05:26.193 --> 05:28.627
<i>- Yeah, that's an 11-foot drop.</i>

05:28.629 --> 05:30.395
<i>- Legs lock,
but they're buckled!</i>

05:30.397 --> 05:33.665
<i>- Ooh! Ooh!
- Oh, ends up wet.</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:36.568
<i>But Clint Sarion
is still smiling.</i>

05:36.570 --> 05:37.869
<i>I can't tell you enough</i>

05:37.871 --> 05:40.405
<i>that technique is critical
on the trampoline.</i>

05:40.407 --> 05:42.307
<i>You can see the legs are apart.</i>

05:42.309 --> 05:43.775
<i>Then his knees buckle,</i>

05:43.777 --> 05:45.777
<i>and he just doesn't get
a enough good bounce.</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:48.847
<i>But that's a good run
for the 43-year-old rookie.</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:51.516
- Whatever happens in life,
you can always

05:51.518 --> 05:53.719
make the most of it.
Keep going.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.220
You'll see me again.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.222
<i>- Well, we've got
a strong group</i>

05:57.224 --> 06:00.425
<i>of women competitors tonight,
and this is one of them.</i>

06:00.427 --> 06:03.662
<i>It's Rachael Goldstein from
nearby Cherry Hill, New Jersey.</i>

06:03.664 --> 06:06.698
<i>She's been tearing it up
in local competitions,</i>

06:06.700 --> 06:10.168
<i>but she does her best
work off the course.</i>

06:10.170 --> 06:13.372
- Yeah, good job!
- Oh, you are awesome!

06:13.374 --> 06:14.973
I'm an occupational therapist.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.541
- I've never done this before.
- I know.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.276
Well, that's the challenge.

06:18.278 --> 06:22.247
Right now, I'm working
with older teens with autism

06:22.249 --> 06:25.217
to cerebral palsy
and Down syndrome.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.053
Are you going backwards?
No way.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.955
<i>If they're working
on motor planning</i>

06:29.957 --> 06:32.324
for coordination or fine
motor skills and hand strength,

06:32.326 --> 06:35.827
I'll try to make
ninja warrior obstacles

06:35.829 --> 06:37.662
<i>to work on those skills,</i>

06:37.664 --> 06:39.164
because I think
it's the most fun way

06:39.166 --> 06:40.532
in the world to work out.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.101
And one, two, three,
four...

06:43.103 --> 06:45.137
I'm doing "Ninja Warrior"
to show them

06:45.139 --> 06:47.672
that they can do
whatever they set their mind to.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.074
That was so good!

06:49.076 --> 06:51.143
And I'm also doing it
to show myself

06:51.145 --> 06:53.845
that I can do anything
that I set my mind to.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.480
- Time to go home.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.385
<i>- And Rachael's got
a big group of supporters,</i>

07:00.387 --> 07:02.721
<i>including Jamie Rahn
with whom she's been training.</i>

07:02.723 --> 07:04.689
- You got it, Rachael!

07:06.593 --> 07:08.927
<i>- Well, Rachael Goldstein
a bit of phenom.</i>

07:08.929 --> 07:10.762
<i>She just started training on
ninja obstacles</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:13.131
<i>four months ago,
but she's been entering</i>

07:13.133 --> 07:16.435
<i>competitions at local gyms,
and she's been winning them.</i>

07:16.437 --> 07:19.805
<i>- And Jamie Rahn says
she's got that fire!</i>

07:19.807 --> 07:21.506
- Trust it, Rach!

07:21.508 --> 07:24.242
<i>- He says to watch out
for Rachael Goldstein.</i>

07:25.579 --> 07:27.479
<i>- Struggling a bit
here on the rope.</i>

07:27.481 --> 07:30.816
<i>It's her first time
on any of these obstacles.</i>

07:30.818 --> 07:32.451
<i>But she's through.</i>

07:32.453 --> 07:35.420
<i>Now the Log Grip,
which took out more than half</i>

07:35.422 --> 07:38.056
<i>the female competitors
last year in Pittsburgh.</i>

07:38.058 --> 07:39.658
<i>Going with the closer handles.</i>

07:39.660 --> 07:41.827
<i>- She's 5'4", 115 pounds.</i>

07:41.829 --> 07:43.361
<i>It makes a lot of sense there</i>

07:43.363 --> 07:45.697
<i>to keep it close
to your body weight there.</i>

07:45.699 --> 07:47.265
<i>- Gets through it.</i>

07:47.267 --> 07:48.867
<i>Now she's moving on
to the Paddle Boards,</i>

07:48.869 --> 07:51.503
<i>which have also been tough
in the past for women.</i>

07:51.505 --> 07:54.272
<i>Only a few have ever
made it past them.</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:59.044
<i>Oh, but Goldstein
rockets through!</i>

07:59.046 --> 08:00.479
<i>Has a background
in gymnastics and diving.</i>

08:00.481 --> 08:02.147
- Goldstein! Goldstein!
- Goldstein!

08:02.149 --> 08:03.915
<i>- And listen to this...</i>

08:03.917 --> 08:06.418
<i>you can hear the crowd
chanting "Goldstein."</i>

08:06.420 --> 08:08.119
- Goldstein!
- Goldstein! Goldstein!

08:08.121 --> 08:09.788
<i>- She's already
at the fourth obstacle,</i>

08:09.790 --> 08:11.756
<i>- the Wall Drop.
- And Matt,</i>

08:11.758 --> 08:13.692
<i>this is going to be
a tough one tonight.</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:16.461
<i>You need upper body strength
here at the beginning,</i>

08:16.463 --> 08:19.397
<i>and then you've got to have
trampoline skills for the back.</i>

08:19.399 --> 08:20.832
<i>- And look at the power there.</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.635
<i>- She is the real-deal athlete.</i>
- Light it up, Rach!

08:23.637 --> 08:25.704
- Deep breaths!
<i>- You gotta be on point,</i>

08:25.706 --> 08:27.539
<i>jump right in the middle
of that trampoline.</i>

08:27.541 --> 08:28.840
<i>- Ooh!
- Grab that thing! Oh, boy!</i>

08:28.842 --> 08:30.542
<i>She tackled
that thing like a football.</i>

08:30.544 --> 08:34.913
<i>- Wow, Rachael Goldstein
hitting it like Steve Goldberg.</i>

08:37.049 --> 08:40.051
<i>- And it is unusual
to see anyone get this far</i>

08:40.053 --> 08:42.354
<i>on the course
this early in the night.</i>

08:42.356 --> 08:45.290
- You got this, Rachael!
<i>- But now the fifth obstacle.</i>

08:45.292 --> 08:46.925
<i>It's called Rolling Thunder,</i>

08:46.927 --> 08:49.528
<i>and it's as ominous
as it sounds.</i>

08:49.530 --> 08:51.830
<i>She has to jump up
to that bar, just like that.</i>

08:51.832 --> 08:53.798
<i>Now she's got to grab
onto the wheel</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:56.768
<i>and roll it down
the track using only her arms.</i>

08:56.770 --> 08:59.337
<i>- But this obstacle's
so upper-body intensive.</i>

08:59.339 --> 09:02.274
<i>Very taxing
for the women... 5'4", 115.</i>

09:02.276 --> 09:04.276
<i>You can see there,
every third section</i>

09:04.278 --> 09:06.011
<i>in the wheel
has Plexiglas in it,</i>

09:06.013 --> 09:07.913
<i>so you have to work around it.</i>

09:07.915 --> 09:10.749
<i>- You can see the power.
- I like what she's showing here.</i>

09:10.751 --> 09:12.150
<i>- Well, she only began training</i>

09:12.152 --> 09:15.086
<i>ninja-warrior
obstacles four months ago.</i>

09:15.088 --> 09:17.489
<i>Talk about natural athleticism.</i>

09:17.491 --> 09:20.559
<i>- Oh, Matt, this is where she
starts to really tire out here.</i>

09:20.561 --> 09:23.728
<i>Matt, at 5'4", she doesn't
have enough power there. Ooh!</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.096
<i>- You were saying?
- About to break the course.</i>

09:25.098 --> 09:26.264
<i>- Look at her!</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:27.832
<i>- She's about to break
this obstacle!</i>

09:27.834 --> 09:31.102
<i>You see that thing rumbling?
She's about to pull it down!</i>

09:32.906 --> 09:34.673
<i>- This is so impressive.</i>

09:34.675 --> 09:36.441
<i>- Matt, she doesn't
even look like she's tired.</i>

09:36.443 --> 09:37.842
<i>Look at her face.</i>

09:37.844 --> 09:39.844
<i>- She's at the next
Plexiglas section now.</i>

09:39.846 --> 09:41.212
<i>Have to reach past it.</i>

09:41.214 --> 09:44.616
<i>- That long reach at just 5'4",
kipping up...</i>

09:44.618 --> 09:46.885
<i>- Her hands have to be
burning right now.</i>

09:46.887 --> 09:47.986
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

09:50.223 --> 09:53.858
<i>So close,
but her grip just gives out.</i>

09:53.860 --> 09:56.127
<i>Well, only a handful of women
have made it</i>

09:56.129 --> 09:58.096
<i>to the fifth obstacle
all season.</i>

09:58.098 --> 10:01.499
<i>Rachael Goldstein just did it
as a rookie.</i>

10:01.501 --> 10:04.569
<i>- Every third section
on that wheel has Plexiglas,</i>

10:04.571 --> 10:06.438
<i>so you can't put your hands
through it.</i>

10:06.440 --> 10:09.641
<i>Watch Goldstein try to reach up
to get around it.</i>

10:09.643 --> 10:13.945
<i>That really taxed her,
and she fell seconds later.</i>

10:13.947 --> 10:15.647
- I thought I had that.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.649
I thought I had the last jump
and grab,

10:17.651 --> 10:20.352
but I just barely missed,
I think.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.787
<i>- Well, two strong runs
start us off.</i>

10:22.789 --> 10:25.457
<i>We could be in for a wild
qualifying round</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:26.791
<i>here in Philly.</i>

10:26.793 --> 10:28.760
<i>Here's what's
coming up tonight.</i>

10:28.762 --> 10:32.297
<i>He's been to the top.
Geoff Britten did it!</i>

10:32.299 --> 10:35.266
<i>Now Geoff Britten starts
something even tougher...</i>

10:35.268 --> 10:37.402
<i>doing it two years in a row.</i>

10:37.404 --> 10:38.603
- It's gonna be a battle.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.006
<i>- Plus...
- Yes!</i>

10:41.008 --> 10:43.174
<i>- Two women have hit
the buzzer this season.</i>

10:43.176 --> 10:45.477
<i>- E-P-I-C, epic.</i>

10:45.479 --> 10:47.479
<i>- And Michelle Warnky wants
to make it three.</i>

10:47.481 --> 10:49.080
- I really want to join them.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.449
<i>- And if you don't think
ballet dancers are athletes,</i>

10:51.451 --> 10:54.252
<i>wait till you
meet Keegan O'Brien.</i>

10:54.254 --> 10:56.187
- I think that's just
beautiful to watch.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.758
<i>- When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

11:02.595 --> 11:04.562
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

11:04.564 --> 11:07.332
<i>at the Richmond power plant
in Philadelphia.</i>

11:07.334 --> 11:09.968
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes tried</i>

11:09.970 --> 11:13.204
<i>to electrify the crowd
on this qualifying course.</i>

11:13.206 --> 11:14.873
<i>- 6'1" Tyler Stroud</i>

11:14.875 --> 11:17.042
<i>is one of the night's
biggest competitors.</i>

11:17.044 --> 11:18.443
<i>- Yeah, he's a big body.</i>

11:18.445 --> 11:21.913
<i>- But the former boxer
still got KO'd at the Log Grip.</i>

11:21.915 --> 11:23.248
<i>- Oh!</i>

11:23.250 --> 11:24.649
- It's harder than I thought.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.118
<i>- Alexi Matousek is a surgical
resident at Harvard</i>

11:27.120 --> 11:30.221
<i>who nearly got his head
taken off last season.</i>

11:30.223 --> 11:31.589
<i>- No!</i>

11:31.591 --> 11:34.325
<i>- This year, he faced
the Log Grip once again.</i>

11:34.327 --> 11:37.028
<i>- Nice! Watch your head.
- That was a close one.</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:38.530
- Yeah!

11:38.532 --> 11:40.098
<i>- But the celebration
was short-lived.</i>

11:40.100 --> 11:42.500
<i>- Oh!
- That's tough.</i>

11:42.502 --> 11:44.769
<i>- Orlando entertainer
Faris Xero</i>

11:44.771 --> 11:46.671
<i>came out dressed as a ninja.</i>

11:46.673 --> 11:48.940
<i>- Oh!
- But a save!</i>

11:48.942 --> 11:51.943
<i>- But after reaching the Wall
Drop, he tore off his costume.</i>

11:51.945 --> 11:54.279
<i>- Game face is on.</i>

11:54.281 --> 11:56.648
<i>- And then nearly
tore up the course.</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:57.916
<i>- Hold on!
- Uh-oh!</i>

11:59.519 --> 12:01.519
<i>- Don't worry, he's okay.</i>

12:03.323 --> 12:05.957
<i>- Up next is Keegan O'Brien.</i>

12:05.959 --> 12:08.460
<i>He's a ballet dancer
from Littleton, Colorado,</i>

12:08.462 --> 12:11.796
<i>and as you can see,
he's got some pecs.</i>

12:11.798 --> 12:13.932
<i>This guy has the moves,
the muscles,</i>

12:13.934 --> 12:18.236
<i>and he wants to prove
that dancers are athletes too.</i>

12:19.806 --> 12:22.707
<i>- I'm a ballet dancer
and a bodybuilder.</i>

12:22.709 --> 12:25.210
<i>I'm not considering
just working out.</i>

12:25.212 --> 12:28.246
I'm trying to build a sculpture,
if you will.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.647
<i>I really have to get
that strength</i>

12:29.649 --> 12:31.983
<i>to be able to lift my partners
and lift myself</i>

12:31.985 --> 12:34.886
<i>when I jump
and fly through the air.</i>

12:34.888 --> 12:36.888
<i>Ballet is definitely
the hardest physical activity</i>

12:36.890 --> 12:38.289
<i>I've ever been a part of.</i>

12:38.291 --> 12:40.091
<i>People think that ballet
is girly,</i>

12:40.093 --> 12:41.693
<i>but really, it looks that way</i>

12:41.695 --> 12:44.195
<i>because it's the job of the
dancer to make it graceful.</i>

12:46.233 --> 12:48.233
<i>Just really trying to make
that audience...</i>

12:48.235 --> 12:50.301
"Wow"... gasp.
That's the... that's the goal.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.340
<i>I want to show that dance
really isn't effeminate.</i>

12:55.342 --> 12:56.808
<i>It's masculine.
It's probably</i>

12:56.810 --> 12:58.643
<i>one of the most manly things
you can do out there,</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:01.813
and I just want to prove the
strength that male dancers have.

13:01.815 --> 13:06.951
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:09.422 --> 13:10.655
<i>- Well, look at this guy.</i>

13:10.657 --> 13:12.857
<i>It's like Baryshnikov
with biceps.</i>

13:12.859 --> 13:14.559
<i>He is built.</i>

13:14.561 --> 13:16.494
<i>You know he's got the agility
and the strength.</i>

13:16.496 --> 13:18.429
<i>Ballet dancers
not often thought</i>

13:18.431 --> 13:20.899
<i>of as ninja-warrior
type athletes,</i>

13:20.901 --> 13:22.801
<i>but you know they've got
grace and balance.</i>

13:22.803 --> 13:24.169
<i>- Yeah, Matt, did you see
the way</i>

13:24.171 --> 13:26.104
<i>he bounded through
the Floating Steps though?</i>

13:26.106 --> 13:27.872
<i>You could see the power there.</i>

13:29.309 --> 13:32.677
<i>- 5'9", 155 pounds.
- He's got to lock in.</i>

13:32.679 --> 13:35.713
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh, right in the gut!</i>

13:35.715 --> 13:39.651
<i>- Wow, first position right
there... a little pirouette.</i>

13:39.653 --> 13:41.553
<i>Ooh, nimble footwork.</i>

13:41.555 --> 13:42.887
<i>- And you've got to believe</i>

13:42.889 --> 13:45.957
<i>he can dance his way
across the Paddle Boards.</i>

13:45.959 --> 13:48.193
<i>- Oh!
- What?</i>

13:48.195 --> 13:50.094
<i>- Well, that is not
the obstacle</i>

13:50.096 --> 13:52.430
<i>I expected him to fall on.</i>

13:52.432 --> 13:55.066
<i>- Ironically, the dancer
wasn't light on his feet.</i>

13:55.068 --> 13:56.634
<i>He was moving too slow,</i>

13:56.636 --> 13:58.236
<i>and when he hits
the third step,</i>

13:58.238 --> 14:00.772
<i>the paddle boards
are almost vertical.</i>

14:00.774 --> 14:02.106
<i>He tried to grab
the landing pad,</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:05.109
<i>but it was too late.</i>

14:05.111 --> 14:07.111
<i>- Well, these passionate fans
in this city</i>

14:07.113 --> 14:08.913
<i>will love our next competitor.</i>

14:08.915 --> 14:12.684
<i>This is Philadelphia
native Najee Richardson.</i>

14:12.686 --> 14:14.452
<i>He was once a top-level
gymnast,</i>

14:14.454 --> 14:17.522
<i>and now he's trying
to become a top-level ninja.</i>

14:17.524 --> 14:21.025
<i>And he is ready
to represent for Philly.</i>

14:21.027 --> 14:23.027
<i>- I grew up in
north Philadelphia,</i>

14:23.029 --> 14:25.263
<i>one of the roughest
neighborhoods...</i>

14:25.265 --> 14:27.899
<i>lot of crime, lot of drugs.</i>

14:29.603 --> 14:31.736
<i>I could kind of hear
my parents crying at night</i>

14:31.738 --> 14:34.405
because we didn't know what
was gonna happen financially.

14:34.407 --> 14:38.476
<i>- As parents, it was up to us
to give Najee a better life,</i>

14:38.478 --> 14:40.678
and it turned out it had
to be gymnastics.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.780
- I think when I was about
eight or ten years old,

14:42.782 --> 14:46.184
I did a backflip off
of this third step right here.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.020
I went up, and I came straight
back down on my head right here,

14:49.022 --> 14:50.822
and I had to be rushed
to the hospital.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.624
It was a huge event.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.561
<i>My dreams were
make it to the Olympics,</i>

14:56.563 --> 14:59.430
<i>make it to college.</i>

14:59.432 --> 15:01.966
<i>But during my senior year
of high school,</i>

15:01.968 --> 15:04.969
<i>I blew my knee out.</i>

15:04.971 --> 15:06.437
<i>- I was so devastated for him,</i>

15:06.439 --> 15:09.107
<i>'cause it was a sport
that he loved,</i>

15:09.109 --> 15:10.541
and he trained for it.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.677
<i>- I was super depressed,</i>

15:12.679 --> 15:15.847
<i>and it's hard to try
and find your way back from it.</i>

15:15.849 --> 15:17.282
<i>Out of left field,</i>

15:17.284 --> 15:19.017
"American Ninja Warrior"
comes around.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.686
<i>It was like everything
clicked again.</i>

15:21.688 --> 15:23.588
<i>My mind started
to get better.</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.790
<i>My body got better.</i>

15:25.792 --> 15:27.125
- Whoo!

15:27.127 --> 15:29.294
<i>- It was almost like,
through "Ninja Warrior,"</i>

15:29.296 --> 15:31.629
<i>I was reborn again.</i>

15:31.631 --> 15:37.302
- As a father, to see
my son come alive again,

15:37.304 --> 15:40.571
<i>it brought joy to our lives.</i>

15:43.209 --> 15:46.144
<i>- I was an athlete
at the top level,</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:48.880
<i>and I feel like that was kind
of cut short for me.</i>

15:48.882 --> 15:52.283
I have a second chance
to get it right this time.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.423
<i>- Najee's girlfriend McKenzie
is here cheering him on,</i>

15:58.425 --> 16:01.526
<i>and so are his parents
Leo and Dara,</i>

16:01.528 --> 16:03.661
<i>all of them wearing the shirts
with a phoenix on it,</i>

16:03.663 --> 16:06.564
<i>symbolizing Najee's return
to competitive sports.</i>

16:06.566 --> 16:09.367
<i>- As he said, he used to be
all about gymnastics.</i>

16:09.369 --> 16:10.835
<i>But after that injury,</i>

16:10.837 --> 16:13.504
<i>it's all about
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

16:13.506 --> 16:15.440
<i>- And you know he wants
to do well</i>

16:15.442 --> 16:17.675
<i>in front of his hometown crowd.</i>

16:21.414 --> 16:22.680
<i>And he's through.</i>

16:22.682 --> 16:24.215
<i>5'7", 155.</i>

16:24.217 --> 16:26.584
<i>He's lean, he's strong,
and he's smiling.</i>

16:26.586 --> 16:28.953
<i>I like it, Akbar.</i>

16:28.955 --> 16:30.321
<i>- Get your mind right.</i>

16:30.323 --> 16:32.757
<i>Be careful on
the Paddle Boards.</i>

16:32.759 --> 16:34.025
<i>- Wow, look at that distance.
- Whoa!</i>

16:34.027 --> 16:35.259
<i>He makes a long leap!</i>

16:35.261 --> 16:36.794
<i>- And you know, Najee said,</i>

16:36.796 --> 16:38.496
<i>"I'm not fooling
with that one."</i>

16:38.498 --> 16:40.598
<i>- Now facing the Wall Drop.</i>

16:42.535 --> 16:43.835
<i>- And as a gymnast,</i>

16:43.837 --> 16:47.171
<i>he should have some experience
on the trampoline.</i>

16:49.075 --> 16:51.976
<i>That is a big drop
from the top of that wall.</i>

16:51.978 --> 16:53.644
<i>- Oh, come on, Najee warrior.</i>

16:53.646 --> 16:55.780
<i>- He sticks it.</i>

16:55.782 --> 16:58.416
<i>But still has to work
his way to the pad.</i>

16:59.586 --> 17:02.120
<i>- Oh... ooh!
- And he's through!</i>

17:02.122 --> 17:04.021
<i>- Now the Philly Phoenix</i>

17:04.023 --> 17:06.624
<i>is gonna take on this brand-new
fifth obstacle,</i>

17:06.626 --> 17:07.925
<i>Rolling Thunder.</i>

17:07.926 --> 17:10.461
<i>- And this is a killer, Matt.</i>

17:10.463 --> 17:13.598
<i>- He has to use his arms
to roll that huge metal wheel</i>

17:13.599 --> 17:16.867
<i>all the way across
the 22-foot track.</i>

17:16.869 --> 17:19.904
<i>And those Plexiglas sections
really make it tough.</i>

17:19.906 --> 17:21.339
<i>You can't put your hands
through those.</i>

17:21.340 --> 17:23.174
<i>You have to reach past them.</i>

17:24.477 --> 17:27.377
<i>And you can see
this tremendous confidence here</i>

17:27.380 --> 17:28.880
<i>on the Rolling Thunder.</i>

17:28.882 --> 17:30.681
<i>- Whoo, Matt, look at that.</i>

17:30.683 --> 17:34.352
<i>Man, he is going straight G.I.
Joe like his fatigue pants.</i>

17:34.354 --> 17:36.821
<i>- But he's been training
for a year for this moment,</i>

17:36.823 --> 17:39.090
<i>and this phoenix is rising
to the occasion.</i>

17:39.092 --> 17:40.625
<i>Oh, look at that!</i>

17:40.627 --> 17:43.428
<i>- Did he just go
Michael Jordan with the tongue?</i>

17:43.430 --> 17:46.330
<i>- The Philly crowd
loving the local kid.</i>

17:46.332 --> 17:48.666
<i>- Najee's not playing.</i>

17:48.668 --> 17:50.568
Najee! Najee!
Najee!

17:50.570 --> 17:52.804
<i>- This would mean so much
to succeed here</i>

17:52.806 --> 17:54.739
<i>in front of his home crowd.</i>

17:56.776 --> 17:59.911
<i>Ooh, he is fighting it.</i>

17:59.913 --> 18:01.946
<i>Oh, he's looking around
for a dismount.</i>

18:01.948 --> 18:04.949
<i>- Own it! Grab that!
- Pull that baby down!</i>

18:04.951 --> 18:08.152
<i>- The fingers are absolutely
utterly exhausted,</i>

18:08.154 --> 18:12.523
<i>but Richardson refusing
to succumb!</i>

18:12.525 --> 18:14.225
<i>- He's going for it.</i>

18:14.227 --> 18:16.994
<i>- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Oh!</i>

18:16.996 --> 18:20.565
<i>- I see you, Najee!
- I see you, baby!</i>

18:20.567 --> 18:23.267
<i>Boy, this is a hometown hero
right now.</i>

18:23.269 --> 18:24.902
I see you, baby boy!

18:24.904 --> 18:28.372
<i>- Well, we've never had
a finisher this early.</i>

18:28.374 --> 18:30.274
<i>If Najee Richardson
gets up the wall,</i>

18:30.276 --> 18:33.711
<i>they may put a statue
of him up next to Rocky.</i>

18:33.713 --> 18:35.880
<i>Here we go.</i>

18:35.882 --> 18:38.416
<i>Yes!
He's got it!</i>

18:39.686 --> 18:42.153
- Yeah!

18:42.155 --> 18:45.156
<i>- And Philadelphia
has a new hero!</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:50.161
<i>- I thought they said
Rocky Balboa</i>

18:50.163 --> 18:51.829
was Philadelphia's favorite!

18:51.831 --> 18:53.931
- Hey, Phoenix is here now!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.733
<i>- Watch his foot
at Rolling Thunder.</i>

18:55.735 --> 18:58.236
<i>He came inches
from hitting the water.</i>

18:58.238 --> 18:59.737
<i>But Philly loves a winner,</i>

18:59.739 --> 19:03.741
<i>and they just got one with
the phoenix, Najee Richardson.</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:05.610
<i>He's our first finisher
tonight.</i>

19:05.612 --> 19:08.779
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM post-run interview.</i>

19:08.781 --> 19:10.715
- Najee, congratulations.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.817
- Thank you.
- You dedicated your life

19:12.819 --> 19:14.285
to this this past year.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.521
How great does it feel to be
at the top of the Warped Wall?

19:16.523 --> 19:19.390
- It feels so good. It's... it's
such an amazing feeling

19:19.392 --> 19:20.958
when you work for something
for so hard,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.095
and just see yourself
accomplish everything

19:24.097 --> 19:25.530
<i>you've been working for
for such a long time.</i>

19:25.532 --> 19:26.731
<i>- Rest up those arms,</i>

19:26.733 --> 19:28.633
because we will see you
in the city finals.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.168
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.170
- Matt and Akbar,
back to you.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.107
<i>- Well, this field in Philly
is packed with ninja greats,</i>

19:36.109 --> 19:39.510
<i>including those two,
Joe Moravsky and Jamie Rahn.</i>

19:39.512 --> 19:41.879
<i>They'll be running
a little later on.</i>

19:41.881 --> 19:44.282
<i>Also coming up,
no one his age</i>

19:44.284 --> 19:46.684
<i>has ever made it past
the first obstacle,</i>

19:46.686 --> 19:51.389
<i>but 64-year-old John Loobey
thinks he can go all the way.</i>

19:51.391 --> 19:53.691
- Those young guys,
they don't intimidate me.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.128
<i>- When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

20:00.232 --> 20:03.234
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Philadelphia.</i>

20:03.236 --> 20:04.602
<i>While we were away,</i>

20:04.604 --> 20:07.371
<i>three more athletes
took their turn on the course.</i>

20:07.373 --> 20:09.607
<i>Caroline Ramsay
came all the way</i>

20:09.609 --> 20:11.375
<i>from Bellevue, Washington.</i>

20:11.377 --> 20:13.511
<i>- Look at the strength there.</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:15.546
<i>- But the power-lifting
botany student</i>

20:15.548 --> 20:17.748
<i>got bounced at the Log Grip.</i>

20:17.750 --> 20:20.818
<i>- Ooh!
- Ooh, right there in her face.</i>

20:20.820 --> 20:23.187
<i>- Pittsburgh schoolteacher
Mike Shuck had one</i>

20:23.189 --> 20:24.789
<i>of the biggest
cheering sections.</i>

20:24.791 --> 20:27.692
<i>- Aw, shucks, come on, Shuck.</i>

20:27.694 --> 20:30.361
<i>- But at the Wall Drop,
Shuck ran out of luck.</i>

20:30.363 --> 20:32.964
<i>- What? How did that happen?
- Oh!</i>

20:32.966 --> 20:35.566
<i>57-year-old Miles Avery</i>

20:35.568 --> 20:37.635
<i>bounced all the way
to the fifth obstacle.</i>

20:37.637 --> 20:39.070
<i>- Oh, he's determined.</i>

20:39.072 --> 20:40.938
- Come on, Miles!
<i>- But the former</i>

20:40.940 --> 20:42.707
<i>U.S. Olympic gymnastics coach</i>

20:42.709 --> 20:45.209
<i>finally gassed out
at Rolling Thunder.</i>

20:45.211 --> 20:46.310
<i>- That's impressive.</i>

20:46.312 --> 20:48.813
- Gotta train a little harder.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.515
<i>- And up next is a guy
who's a world-class athlete</i>

20:51.517 --> 20:53.951
<i>in a sport you
may not be familiar with.</i>

20:53.953 --> 20:57.188
<i>This is Logan Broadbent
from Cleveland, Ohio,</i>

20:57.190 --> 21:00.625
<i>and he is one of America's
best with a boomerang.</i>

21:03.529 --> 21:05.596
<i>- Boomerangs are
the most ferocious, bodacious,</i>

21:05.598 --> 21:07.098
<i>vivacious, gregarious,
low-to-the-ground,</i>

21:07.100 --> 21:08.366
<i>hard-to-bring-down,
bopping and weaving,</i>

21:08.368 --> 21:10.001
<i>shaking and baking,
stopping on a dime</i>

21:10.003 --> 21:11.135
<i>and leave nine cents behind,
number-one,</i>

21:11.137 --> 21:13.237
<i>second-to-none sport
in the world.</i>

21:13.239 --> 21:14.338
Whoo!

21:16.309 --> 21:17.475
I'm currently
the number-one-ranked

21:17.477 --> 21:19.076
boomerang
thrower in America,

21:19.078 --> 21:22.213
<i>and I'm the reigning world
trick catch champion.</i>

21:23.583 --> 21:25.349
<i>I'm the only one
who can do a backflip</i>

21:25.351 --> 21:27.385
<i>and catch the boomerang
mid-flip.</i>

21:27.387 --> 21:28.719
Yeah!

21:28.721 --> 21:30.721
<i>A lot of the same skills
that it takes to be</i>

21:30.723 --> 21:33.190
<i>a ninja are involved
in boomerang throwing.</i>

21:35.094 --> 21:38.029
<i>You have to be fast.
You have to be agile.</i>

21:38.031 --> 21:39.764
<i>The boomerangs that we throw
and catch</i>

21:39.766 --> 21:41.899
<i>are moving in excess
of 80 miles per hour.</i>

21:43.603 --> 21:46.704
<i>Hand-eye coordination
is extremely important.</i>

21:46.706 --> 21:49.573
One slip, one mistake,
can cause you to lose an event.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.609
<i>I see
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

21:51.611 --> 21:54.779
<i>as being the pinnacle
of athletic achievement.</i>

21:56.115 --> 21:57.748
<i>I'm always pushing myself.</i>

21:57.750 --> 21:59.050
<i>And without pushing
your limits,</i>

21:59.052 --> 22:00.851
you never know
what you can achieve.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.856
<i>- And he's got his family here
from Cleveland,</i>

22:05.858 --> 22:07.558
<i>along with his girlfriend.</i>

22:07.560 --> 22:10.094
<i>What can the Boomerang Ninja
do?</i>

22:10.096 --> 22:11.929
<i>Well, there's actually
a lot more to Logan Broadbent</i>

22:11.931 --> 22:14.298
<i>than boomerangs. He is a solid
all-around athlete.</i>

22:14.300 --> 22:15.833
<i>- Yeah, he really is.</i>

22:15.835 --> 22:18.869
<i>He was an all-American diver
in high school.</i>

22:18.871 --> 22:22.540
<i>- 5'5", 128... very lean,
very small,</i>

22:22.542 --> 22:25.576
<i>but powerful...
a very athletic competitor.</i>

22:29.349 --> 22:30.948
<i>Lifting up his shirt</i>

22:30.950 --> 22:34.085
<i>so it's easier
to stick on the Log Grip.</i>

22:34.087 --> 22:37.188
- Hang on tight, Logan!
- You got this!

22:37.190 --> 22:39.824
<i>- Check it out... he's using
the handles farthest from him.</i>

22:39.826 --> 22:41.992
<i>- Looking strong.</i>

22:41.994 --> 22:45.196
<i>And getting the crowd
into it.</i>

22:45.198 --> 22:48.799
<i>All right, now needs balance
for the Paddle Boards.</i>

22:48.801 --> 22:50.868
<i>- Be light on your feet.
- Be light on your feet.</i>

22:50.870 --> 22:53.637
<i>- Right through it and upright.
- Look at that!</i>

22:53.639 --> 22:55.005
<i>- Ooh!</i>

22:55.007 --> 22:56.741
<i>- He told the... he just told
the Paddle Boards,</i>

22:56.743 --> 22:58.743
<i>"Shut your mouth."</i>

22:58.745 --> 23:00.978
<i>- But now onto the Wall Drop.</i>

23:00.980 --> 23:03.848
<i>Again, this is
a brand-new obstacle,</i>

23:03.850 --> 23:05.950
<i>so let's see what the world
champion boomerang thrower</i>

23:05.952 --> 23:08.519
<i>has for grip strength.</i>

23:08.521 --> 23:11.021
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.</i>

23:11.023 --> 23:13.591
<i>- Well, he is a rookie.
- This is his first time.</i>

23:16.295 --> 23:19.497
<i>That's an 11-foot
drop to the tramp.</i>

23:22.301 --> 23:23.934
<i>- The key here is the secret...</i>

23:23.936 --> 23:25.136
<i>hit it compressed
and fly up!</i>

23:25.138 --> 23:26.337
<i>- Boom!
- Look at that!</i>

23:26.339 --> 23:27.405
<i>Looked a little Spider-Man</i>

23:27.407 --> 23:28.873
<i>flying through the air there.</i>

23:28.875 --> 23:30.841
<i>- Well, he went
right onto the log.</i>

23:30.843 --> 23:34.545
<i>He hit that trampoline a little
in the back, but locked on.</i>

23:34.547 --> 23:36.747
- You got this!

23:36.749 --> 23:38.916
- You got this!

23:38.918 --> 23:40.885
<i>- Uh-oh,
get that momentum going.</i>

23:40.887 --> 23:42.520
<i>- Well, and this is
the thing, Akbar.</i>

23:42.522 --> 23:44.321
<i>I think he needs to drop
down lower on the log.</i>

23:44.323 --> 23:45.956
<i>- He's having trouble extending.
- He does.</i>

23:45.958 --> 23:48.058
<i>I don't think
he's figuring that out.</i>

23:52.064 --> 23:54.398
<i>- That's it.</i>
- Yeah!

23:54.400 --> 23:56.934
<i>- The Boomerang Ninja
gets through...</i>

23:56.936 --> 23:58.669
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

23:58.671 --> 24:01.505
<i>- And he's moving on
to Rolling Thunder.</i>

24:01.507 --> 24:03.240
- You got it!
- You got it!

24:04.844 --> 24:06.911
<i>- Now here, at 128 pounds,</i>

24:06.913 --> 24:09.413
<i>is where that lack of mass
can be a disadvantage,</i>

24:09.415 --> 24:12.316
<i>moving this massive wheel.</i>

24:12.318 --> 24:14.685
<i>- Oh, look at him
going forearm here.</i>

24:14.687 --> 24:15.986
<i>I like that!</i>

24:15.988 --> 24:17.221
<i>Okay, I don't have
grip strength,</i>

24:17.223 --> 24:18.956
<i>so I'm gonna use
my forearm here.</i>

24:18.958 --> 24:20.458
<i>But watch out
for the drop here.</i>

24:20.460 --> 24:22.092
<i>- Well, he's only 5'5",</i>

24:22.094 --> 24:24.195
<i>so he's really got to work
for it.</i>

24:24.197 --> 24:25.629
<i>Oh!</i>

24:29.635 --> 24:31.802
- It's okay, Logan!
<i>- Logan Broadbent,</i>

24:31.804 --> 24:33.404
<i>out at Rolling Thunder.</i>

24:33.406 --> 24:37.274
<i>But we know the Boomerang
Ninja will come back.</i>

24:37.276 --> 24:39.410
<i>- Well, he tried
a different technique,</i>

24:39.412 --> 24:41.445
<i>hooking his forearms
through the wheel.</i>

24:41.447 --> 24:43.414
<i>That takes pressure
off the arms.</i>

24:43.416 --> 24:45.049
<i>But even with that,</i>

24:45.051 --> 24:47.985
<i>the Boomerang Ninja
came up short.</i>

24:47.987 --> 24:50.187
<i>- Well, she is one of the best.</i>

24:50.189 --> 24:52.456
<i>Michelle Warnky has made it
to the city finals</i>

24:52.458 --> 24:54.024
<i>the past two seasons.</i>

24:54.026 --> 24:56.560
<i>She'll try to make it
three later tonight.</i>

24:56.562 --> 24:57.862
<i>Also coming up...</i>

24:57.864 --> 24:59.330
Yeah!

24:59.332 --> 25:02.066
<i>- Last season,
Geoff Britten hit the buzzer</i>

25:02.068 --> 25:03.868
<i>on every course he ran.</i>

25:03.870 --> 25:05.636
<i>Geoff Britten did it!</i>

25:05.638 --> 25:08.472
<i>Can he keep his
streak alive this year?</i>

25:08.474 --> 25:10.708
- Is that possible?
- Stay tuned.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.911
<i>- When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

25:17.916 --> 25:19.984
<i>- Welcome back to
Philadelphia Qualifying.</i>

25:19.986 --> 25:22.353
<i>"American Ninja Warrior"
is brought to you in part</i>

25:22.355 --> 25:24.622
<i>by our friends at SB Nation.</i>

25:24.624 --> 25:26.624
<i>For more behind-the-scenes
ninja action,</i>

25:26.626 --> 25:29.660
<i>go to ANWNation.com.</i>

25:29.662 --> 25:33.430
<i>And right now on the course,
25-year-old Allyssa Beird.</i>

25:33.432 --> 25:35.366
<i>Oh!</i>

25:35.368 --> 25:38.068
<i>The Beird survives.</i>

25:38.070 --> 25:40.337
<i>She's a fifth-grade teacher</i>

25:40.339 --> 25:42.506
<i>from Marlborough,
Massachusetts.</i>

25:42.508 --> 25:44.275
<i>- And she's got
a gymnastics background,</i>

25:44.277 --> 25:46.243
<i>which should help her
on the Paddle Boards.</i>

25:46.245 --> 25:47.945
<i>Yes!</i>

25:47.947 --> 25:51.549
<i>Allyssa's mom, dad, and sister
here in Philadelphia tonight.</i>

25:51.551 --> 25:54.151
<i>And probably every kid
from Henry B. Burkland</i>

25:54.153 --> 25:56.120
<i>Elementary School
in Middleborough, Mass.,</i>

25:56.122 --> 25:59.056
<i>is watching
their teacher right now.</i>

25:59.058 --> 26:02.693
<i>- Look at that tremendous
strength... that ascent.</i>

26:02.695 --> 26:03.928
<i>She's making it look easy.</i>

26:03.930 --> 26:07.331
<i>This is an impressive
rookie here.</i>

26:07.333 --> 26:08.999
<i>- Get this girl an apple,</i>

26:09.001 --> 26:11.235
<i>because she is
the teacher of the year.</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.072
<i>- It's gonna be this
dismount here.</i>

26:15.074 --> 26:17.174
<i>It's a long drop.
Wow!</i>

26:17.176 --> 26:19.476
<i>- Whoa!
- And the gymnast in her</i>

26:19.478 --> 26:21.312
<i>just made that look easy.</i>

26:21.314 --> 26:24.748
<i>- My fifth-grade teacher, Mrs.
- Winterson, couldn't do that!</i>

26:27.186 --> 26:29.587
- One more!
- Yeah!

26:29.589 --> 26:30.955
<i>- Building up momentum,</i>

26:30.957 --> 26:32.823
<i>but on the back side
of the log... hooks it in!</i>

26:32.825 --> 26:34.625
<i>- Ooh, wow.
- Gets the other one.</i>

26:34.627 --> 26:36.193
- All right!

26:36.195 --> 26:37.861
<i>- And now she's gonna take on</i>

26:37.863 --> 26:40.864
<i>the fifth obstacle,
Rolling Thunder.</i>

26:40.866 --> 26:42.967
<i>Only the Philly Phoenix,
Najee Richardson,</i>

26:42.969 --> 26:44.868
<i>has conquered it so far.</i>

26:44.870 --> 26:47.638
<i>- Well, she's only 5'4",
125 pounds,</i>

26:47.640 --> 26:50.608
<i>so she's really gonna have
to work to move this wheel.</i>

26:50.610 --> 26:53.811
<i>- Well, she was the state
champion on the uneven bars.</i>

26:53.813 --> 26:57.047
<i>You know she's got a lot of
upper-body power and control.</i>

26:57.049 --> 26:59.083
<i>- Ooh, ooh!
- That almost threw her off</i>

26:59.085 --> 27:01.418
<i>right there, that uneven drop.</i>

27:01.420 --> 27:02.886
<i>- Look at that!
- Look at her!</i>

27:02.888 --> 27:04.922
<i>- She's smiling!
- She is all right with this.</i>

27:04.924 --> 27:06.457
<i>Wow!</i>

27:06.459 --> 27:08.258
<i>- Well, you can
teach me anything.</i>

27:08.260 --> 27:10.628
<i>- And right past
the Plexiglas wall</i>

27:10.630 --> 27:12.496
<i>on that every third spoke.</i>

27:12.498 --> 27:15.766
<i>The difficulty level of this
obstacle... so impressive.</i>

27:15.768 --> 27:18.569
<i>- Well, Matt, I can tell you,
she's already on her way</i>

27:18.571 --> 27:21.505
<i>to becoming the most popular
fifth-grade teacher...</i>

27:21.507 --> 27:24.108
<i>- Whoa!
- In America... look at this!</i>

27:24.110 --> 27:27.077
<i>- What body control!
- What power!</i>

27:27.079 --> 27:30.347
- Yes!
- Come on!

27:30.349 --> 27:34.084
<i>- Unbelievable effort out
of Allyssa Beird.</i>

27:34.086 --> 27:35.619
<i>- Wow, Matt.
- And what's crazy</i>

27:35.621 --> 27:37.121
<i>is that
she's only been training</i>

27:37.123 --> 27:39.056
<i>on ninja obstacles for a year.</i>

27:39.058 --> 27:41.025
<i>- Only had a handful of women
have made it</i>

27:41.027 --> 27:43.661
<i>to the fifth obstacle
all season.</i>

27:43.663 --> 27:45.496
<i>- I got to tell you, what
an effort out of this woman.</i>

27:45.498 --> 27:47.564
<i>She might be going
for a dismount here, Akbar.</i>

27:47.566 --> 27:50.034
<i>- She's gonna have to go
for a backward dismount here.</i>

27:50.036 --> 27:52.002
<i>But I think she's going up.
Look at her, getting her L...</i>

27:52.004 --> 27:54.071
<i>- There's the Plexiglas.
- Oh!</i>

27:54.073 --> 27:58.108
<i>- Splashes down.
- The Beird gets wet.</i>

27:58.110 --> 28:01.078
<i>What an effort out
of Allyssa Beird.</i>

28:01.080 --> 28:04.181
<i>Look at her give a thumbs up
midway through the obstacle.</i>

28:04.183 --> 28:05.983
<i>That's confidence
for a rookie.</i>

28:05.985 --> 28:09.019
<i>She's now the second woman to
make it to the fifth obstacle.</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:10.654
<i>We'll have to wait and see,</i>

28:10.656 --> 28:13.991
<i>but that might
keep them both in the top 30.</i>

28:13.993 --> 28:17.761
- I just lost it on that
last grab... so close.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.731
<i>- Well, our ninja athletes
come from all backgrounds,</i>

28:20.733 --> 28:23.100
<i>and our next competitor
is proof of that.</i>

28:23.102 --> 28:26.537
<i>From Queens, New York,
this is Akiva Neuman.</i>

28:26.539 --> 28:29.006
<i>He's studying to become
a rabbi,</i>

28:29.008 --> 28:32.776
<i>and he's ready to blow away
some expectations.</i>

28:32.778 --> 28:35.913
- Zoreg Ahaz,
he would juggle, right?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.748
The rabbis themselves...
we have a tradition

28:37.750 --> 28:39.083
that some of the greatest
rabbis

28:39.085 --> 28:41.218
would learn acrobatic skills

28:41.220 --> 28:43.754
in order
to make other people happy.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.255
<i>- I'm a student
at Yeshiva University,</i>

28:45.257 --> 28:46.457
<i>training to be a rabbi.</i>

28:46.459 --> 28:49.059
<i>Usually, rabbi goes along
with pot belly,</i>

28:49.061 --> 28:50.761
so I'm gonna try
and change that.

28:50.763 --> 28:53.997
<i>Rabbi and being in shape
is not a contradiction.</i>

28:55.735 --> 28:57.501
<i>- My husband is very strong.</i>

28:57.503 --> 28:59.436
<i>And for some reason, people
just don't assume that</i>

28:59.438 --> 29:01.739
<i>religious Jews are
gonna have time to work out,</i>

29:01.741 --> 29:02.940
'cause they just imagine

29:02.942 --> 29:04.308
that they're sitting
in the shul all day

29:04.310 --> 29:06.310
or they're learning all day.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.811
- Hey!

29:07.813 --> 29:09.213
Ooh!

29:09.215 --> 29:12.783
<i>My son, Yaakov Shmuel,
he was born five months ago.</i>

29:14.453 --> 29:17.454
Definitely adds to the
excitement going on in my life.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.293
<i>Between studying Talmudic law
or playing with baby toys</i>

29:23.295 --> 29:25.629
<i>and my son...</i>
And one, and two...

29:25.631 --> 29:27.464
<i>If I didn't train
for "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

29:27.466 --> 29:29.633
I'd be on shpilkes!

29:33.172 --> 29:34.671
<i>Next time you see a rabbi
walking in the street,</i>

29:34.673 --> 29:37.241
<i>don't just think,
"He can't do any of that."</i>

29:37.243 --> 29:39.476
Maybe he's gonna be
the next ninja warrior.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.981
<i>- He's got the whole family
here</i>

29:43.983 --> 29:45.482
<i>and a big bunch of supporters</i>

29:45.484 --> 29:48.185
<i>ready to cheer on
the Rabbi Ninja.</i>

29:51.724 --> 29:53.657
<i>- You can see the religion's
so important to him,</i>

29:53.659 --> 29:55.459
<i>competing with a yarmulke on.</i>

29:55.461 --> 29:59.029
<i>- Yeah, hold on
to that yarmulke.</i>

29:59.031 --> 30:01.498
<i>- Well, he's 5'6", 150 pounds,</i>

30:01.500 --> 30:04.234
<i>and this is his first time
trying a ninja course.</i>

30:06.572 --> 30:08.639
<i>Being cautious
on the Floating Steps.</i>

30:11.977 --> 30:14.077
<i>- And there he is pointing
to the crowd, though.</i>

30:14.079 --> 30:17.214
<i>I love the confidence
out of Akiva.</i>

30:17.216 --> 30:19.750
<i>- But a little hung up here.
- Oh, boy,</i>

30:19.752 --> 30:22.119
<i>I hope you did your
studying here on this course.</i>

30:24.123 --> 30:26.423
- What're doing?
- Playing games?

30:26.425 --> 30:27.491
- He's good.
- He's good.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.299
<i>- Is he doing the split...
is he stretching now?</i>

30:35.301 --> 30:37.267
<i>Okay, I like that.
Okay, he's stretching out.</i>

30:37.269 --> 30:39.236
<i>- I'm not sure if he felt
an injury there,</i>

30:39.238 --> 30:42.239
<i>but he's pulling up his pants
and his tzitzit there.</i>

30:42.241 --> 30:45.275
<i>That's the religious garb
for the Orthodox Jews.</i>

30:47.179 --> 30:49.913
<i>He's got those legs locked on,
trying to get some grip.</i>

30:49.915 --> 30:51.582
<i>Oh, look at this!</i>

30:51.584 --> 30:53.417
<i>- He's got the grip strength
for sure.</i>

30:53.419 --> 30:55.986
<i>Look at that, Matt!</i>

30:55.988 --> 30:58.255
<i>- And the celebration,
it's... some might think</i>

30:58.257 --> 31:00.424
<i>it's Christmastime in Hollis,
Queens,</i>

31:00.426 --> 31:01.959
<i>but I think it's Hanukkah time.</i>

31:01.961 --> 31:04.494
<i>He's celebrating, Akbar.</i>

31:04.496 --> 31:06.730
<i>But talk about a taxing
obstacle... the Paddle Boards.</i>

31:06.732 --> 31:10.000
<i>5'6", 150... can he be light
on his feet?</i>

31:10.002 --> 31:11.668
<i>- And Matt, he sold it.
- He sold it!</i>

31:11.670 --> 31:14.438
<i>He has got a lot
of fight here, Matt.</i>

31:14.440 --> 31:15.772
<i>Matt, I'm telling you
right now,</i>

31:15.774 --> 31:17.174
<i>getting past the Paddle Board</i>

31:17.176 --> 31:19.509
<i>that has taken out
so many competitors tonight,</i>

31:19.511 --> 31:22.512
<i>Matt, Akiva just had
his ninja bar mitzvah.</i>

31:22.514 --> 31:24.348
<i>He has come of age right now,
as a rookie.</i>

31:26.886 --> 31:29.887
<i>Pull up, now, pull up!
You gotta man up here.</i>

31:29.889 --> 31:32.756
<i>- Come of age!
- Oh, this guy seems unaware</i>

31:32.758 --> 31:35.392
<i>of how difficult
this obstacle really is.</i>

31:35.394 --> 31:36.894
<i>- Matt, if he doesn't show
that upper-body strength,</i>

31:36.896 --> 31:38.362
<i>it's gonna be
night-night for him.</i>

31:38.364 --> 31:39.963
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

31:39.965 --> 31:42.232
<i>- Uh-oh, okay,
he's got his glasses on.</i>

31:42.234 --> 31:44.835
<i>He's got that wall
rocking back and forth.</i>

31:46.605 --> 31:48.839
<i>You want to slide down,
hit that trampoline.</i>

31:48.841 --> 31:49.973
<i>Uh-oh,
you see him fighting it.</i>

31:49.975 --> 31:51.575
<i>- And you can see it
rocking there.</i>

31:51.577 --> 31:53.143
<i>- Hit it. Hit it!
- Lock in... oh!</i>

31:53.145 --> 31:56.413
<i>- It's like he stuck there
like a fly on a glue stick!</i>

31:56.415 --> 31:57.514
<i>- Wow!
- Look at that!</i>

31:57.516 --> 32:00.083
<i>- This is
a fight here indeed.</i>

32:02.087 --> 32:05.589
<i>- You got to hold on.
- Don't get your yarmulke wet!</i>

32:05.591 --> 32:07.791
<i>Hold on.
Hold on.</i>

32:07.793 --> 32:09.826
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- He doesn't have a plan, Matt.</i>

32:09.828 --> 32:11.295
<i>He doesn't have a plan.
Get that other one out my way.</i>

32:11.297 --> 32:12.796
<i>- Move out the way.
- The Ninja Rabbi</i>

32:12.798 --> 32:15.532
<i>still fighting,
but he has lost his momentum.</i>

32:15.534 --> 32:16.900
<i>- Get the... oh, no.</i>

32:16.902 --> 32:18.535
<i>Matt, I think he's gonna
go night-night.</i>

32:18.537 --> 32:21.371
<i>Somebody sing a lullaby
for the rabbi!</i>

32:21.373 --> 32:24.474
<i>- Well, it's like he's got
no energy.</i>

32:24.476 --> 32:26.043
<i>- Oh!</i>

32:26.045 --> 32:29.313
<i>- But no, he splashes down.</i>

32:29.315 --> 32:31.481
<i>Akiva coming up
just a bit short,</i>

32:31.483 --> 32:35.252
<i>but you wouldn't know it
by the smile on his face.</i>

32:35.254 --> 32:37.788
<i>- Hey,
can your rabbi do this?</i>

32:37.790 --> 32:40.257
<i>Look at Akiva Neuman hit
the trampoline</i>

32:40.259 --> 32:42.693
<i>and go boom,
right up the tube.</i>

32:42.695 --> 32:44.161
<i>He didn't get any further,</i>

32:44.163 --> 32:47.931
<i>but that's an impressive run
by the rookie rabbi.</i>

32:47.933 --> 32:49.900
- Whew!
- That was awesome.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.602
Whew!
What a thrill.

32:52.604 --> 32:56.540
<i>- Still to come, she was
a superstar in track and field.</i>

32:56.542 --> 33:00.577
<i>Now Flex Labreck is bringing
her talent to our course.</i>

33:00.579 --> 33:02.112
- It's going to be amazing.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.716
<i>- Plus, Joe Moravsky's come
close to winning it all.</i>

33:05.718 --> 33:07.250
- I'm coming for you!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.086
<i>- But this year his training
is different.</i>

33:09.088 --> 33:11.254
- He's licking your finger.
- It's a new world for me.

33:11.256 --> 33:15.726
<i>- The Weatherman's coming up
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

33:17.996 --> 33:19.730
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

33:19.732 --> 33:22.199
<i>from the City of
Brotherly Love.</i>

33:22.201 --> 33:24.301
<i>While we were away,
a trio of athletes</i>

33:24.303 --> 33:26.303
<i>took their shot on the course.</i>

33:26.305 --> 33:28.138
<i>Hula hoop instructor
Dayna Fisher</i>

33:28.140 --> 33:30.240
<i>wowed the crowd
at the start line.</i>

33:30.242 --> 33:31.441
<i>- That's impressive.</i>

33:31.443 --> 33:33.410
<i>- But not so much
on the course.</i>

33:33.412 --> 33:35.679
<i>- Oh!
- And the hoop dreams</i>

33:35.681 --> 33:37.080
<i>have been crushed.</i>

33:37.082 --> 33:39.649
<i>Mike Meyers was one of
last year's top rookies,</i>

33:39.651 --> 33:42.452
<i>making it all the way
to Stage 2 in Vegas.</i>

33:42.454 --> 33:44.621
<i>Schwing from Mike Meyers.</i>

33:44.623 --> 33:47.257
<i>But the engineer was bounced
this year at the Wall Drop.</i>

33:47.259 --> 33:51.061
<i>- Oh!
- Mike Meyers, not excellent.</i>

33:51.063 --> 33:52.929
<i>He will not party on.</i>

33:52.931 --> 33:56.633
<i>E.R. Doctor Richard Shoemaker
was impressive from the start.</i>

33:56.635 --> 33:58.935
<i>- Who do you think you are,
Dr. Bruce Lee?</i>

33:58.937 --> 34:00.570
<i>- But even more impressive,</i>

34:00.572 --> 34:02.005
<i>the 40-year-old dad came within</i>

34:02.007 --> 34:04.541
<i>a few feet of finishing
Rolling Thunder.</i>

34:04.543 --> 34:09.246
<i>- Oh, he goes down!
- Shoemaker just gassed... out.</i>

34:10.681 --> 34:12.315
<i>But right now
at the start line,</i>

34:12.317 --> 34:14.885
<i>it's Anita Daniel
from Brooklyn, New York,</i>

34:14.887 --> 34:17.987
<i>and she is a firefighter
in New York City.</i>

34:20.426 --> 34:23.293
- It's very difficult
taking care of a four year old

34:23.295 --> 34:25.195
<i>and being a firefighter,</i>

34:25.197 --> 34:26.897
but somehow it just works.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.333
<i>Being in something
that's so male-dominated,</i>

34:31.335 --> 34:32.803
it kind of gives me
that confidence

34:32.804 --> 34:34.804
and kind of just like,
"Look, I'm gonna show you too."

34:34.806 --> 34:36.273
<i>I have a lot going on
right now,</i>

34:36.275 --> 34:38.675
Being a firefighter,
being a single mom.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.844
<i>But that doesn't mean
that I can't take on</i>

34:41.847 --> 34:43.780
<i>one more challenge,
and especially if it helps</i>

34:43.782 --> 34:46.149
other girls see that
they can do

34:46.150 --> 34:48.217
whatever they want to do,
I'm gonna do it.

34:48.219 --> 34:53.623
- My mommy's gonna be
the next ninja warrior.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.025
- And kisses.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.761
<i>- And there's Anita's daughter</i>

34:57.763 --> 34:59.362
<i>on the shoulders
of her boyfriend,</i>

34:59.364 --> 35:01.264
<i>plus some of the other
female firefighters</i>

35:01.266 --> 35:02.699
<i>in the New York Fire
Department.</i>

35:02.701 --> 35:05.268
<i>- Look at that smile.</i>

35:05.270 --> 35:08.338
<i>This is a woman of
determination, a single mother</i>

35:08.340 --> 35:13.110
<i>and one of only 52 women
on the FDNY, Akbar.</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:15.178
<i>- Yeah, Matt, and that's
a huge accomplishment for her.</i>

35:15.180 --> 35:17.514
<i>And now she finds herself
on the Floating Steps,</i>

35:17.516 --> 35:19.816
<i>front and center
on "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

35:19.818 --> 35:22.986
<i>competing alongside
some of the best in the sport.</i>

35:24.123 --> 35:27.891
- Come on, baby, you got this!
- You got this.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.260
<i>- Well, we've had
so many great firefighters</i>

35:30.262 --> 35:31.795
<i>in the day, guys, like... whoa.</i>

35:31.797 --> 35:34.498
<i>- Ooh, uh-oh, hold on, girl.
- A little hung up.</i>

35:36.768 --> 35:39.503
<i>Daniel, she seems to be
a bit disoriented here,</i>

35:39.505 --> 35:40.770
<i>- having trouble.
- Well, as a firefighter,</i>

35:40.772 --> 35:42.405
<i>she knows how to fight
on the rope there.</i>

35:42.407 --> 35:43.974
<i>Girl, you know how to fight.
Come on.</i>

35:43.976 --> 35:46.076
<i>- And a good push.
- Oh... ooh!</i>

35:46.078 --> 35:48.311
<i>Anita Daniel...</i>

35:50.182 --> 35:53.383
<i>Her run not
extinguished just yet!</i>

35:53.385 --> 35:55.252
<i>- Now onto the Log Grip.</i>

35:55.254 --> 35:57.854
<i>Only 5'3", so it may be tough
to wrap her arms</i>

35:57.856 --> 35:59.089
<i>around the log.</i>

36:00.926 --> 36:03.093
<i>- Oh, hold on, girl!
- And right through.</i>

36:03.095 --> 36:05.729
<i>- I see you,
representing for the Big Apple.</i>

36:05.731 --> 36:09.232
<i>Anita, Apple bomb,
you got to keep it going!</i>

36:10.602 --> 36:12.135
- I love you, Erin!

36:12.137 --> 36:14.404
<i>- And look at the smile
on her daughter's face.</i>

36:14.406 --> 36:17.574
<i>Now the Paddle Boards.</i>

36:17.576 --> 36:18.675
<i>- Uh-oh, uh-oh!</i>

36:18.677 --> 36:20.644
<i>- Oh!
- Emergency! No!</i>

36:23.015 --> 36:27.751
<i>- It was a fun run,
but the firefighter gets wet.</i>

36:27.753 --> 36:29.419
<i>- Well, she never
looked comfortable.</i>

36:29.421 --> 36:32.255
<i>On her left side,
she's barely on the paddles.</i>

36:32.257 --> 36:34.958
<i>On the right side,
she's much further out,</i>

36:34.960 --> 36:36.626
<i>and that caused the whole thing</i>

36:36.628 --> 36:40.597
<i>to lean right
and throw her into the water.</i>

36:40.599 --> 36:43.733
- Ah, I'm kind of upset,
but I had fun.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.368
Had fun.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.903
<i>- Our next competitor comes</i>

36:46.905 --> 36:49.806
<i>from just up the road
in Horsham, Pennsylvania.</i>

36:49.808 --> 36:52.075
<i>This is John Gowder, Jr.</i>

36:52.077 --> 36:54.578
<i>He's a hard-working
industrial electrician,</i>

36:54.580 --> 36:57.447
<i>and he's doing this
for the whole Gowder family.</i>

36:58.884 --> 37:00.817
<i>- I'm a third-generation
electrician...</i>

37:00.819 --> 37:02.786
my grandfather
and my father, and then me.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.757
<i>My dad has MS,</i>

37:07.759 --> 37:09.192
and it just
progressively got worse,

37:09.194 --> 37:11.294
and now he's permanently
in a wheelchair.

37:13.699 --> 37:17.534
<i>Times got hard,
and he got sicker...</i>

37:20.138 --> 37:24.674
<i>So me and my wife
moved back in to help them.</i>

37:24.676 --> 37:29.246
I do a lot of the house chores
that my dad can't physically do.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.248
<i>One day, my father...</i>

37:31.250 --> 37:33.216
<i>- Here's what's
coming up tonight!</i>

37:33.218 --> 37:34.818
<i>- He turns the show on.</i>

37:34.820 --> 37:37.153
- Oh, my God, look at him go.
- Oh, my God.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.089
He's like, "I love these guys!
They're so great!"

37:39.091 --> 37:42.058
And I just thought to myself,
like, "That's awesome."

37:42.060 --> 37:45.061
I'm like, "I could do this,
and I could do it for him."

37:45.063 --> 37:47.297
- Come on, keep going.
- Come on.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.465
That's it, keep going.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.532
<i>- He was saying that
this morning,</i>

37:49.534 --> 37:51.501
when I was about to leave,
you know,

37:51.503 --> 37:53.169
"How awesome would that be,
if you hit the buzzer?"

37:53.171 --> 37:54.504
You know?

37:54.506 --> 37:57.207
And I really want to do that
for him, and I'm gonna.

37:57.209 --> 37:59.209
- This is my son John,
and he's gonna be the next

37:59.211 --> 38:01.211
"American Ninja Warrior."

38:03.248 --> 38:06.082
<i>- And look at the family
support... his mom,</i>

38:06.084 --> 38:09.185
<i>dad, his wife,
all out here wearing shirts.</i>

38:09.187 --> 38:11.988
<i>The mom and dad, their shirts
say, "Our son is a ninja."</i>

38:11.990 --> 38:15.592
<i>And he is right now, floating
through the Floating Steps.</i>

38:15.594 --> 38:18.728
<i>- Yeah, a big ninja
at 6'2" and 170 pounds.</i>

38:18.730 --> 38:21.231
<i>But he's never been
on a course before.</i>

38:21.233 --> 38:24.067
<i>- He gets through.</i>

38:24.069 --> 38:25.302
<i>This is a guy who didn't play</i>

38:25.304 --> 38:27.003
<i>a lot of organized sports
growing up,</i>

38:27.005 --> 38:30.273
<i>but at 34, went from the couch
to the course.</i>

38:30.275 --> 38:32.242
<i>And he's through the Log Grip.</i>

38:34.913 --> 38:37.714
<i>And look at that...
double point to his dad.</i>

38:39.318 --> 38:41.084
<i>And makes it through
the Paddle Boards.</i>

38:41.086 --> 38:42.952
<i>He and his dad
had some disagreements</i>

38:42.954 --> 38:44.487
<i>over the family business.</i>

38:44.489 --> 38:47.957
<i>"American Ninja Warrior"
bringing them back together.</i>

38:47.959 --> 38:50.160
<i>Good seeing the family
out here together, Akbar.</i>

38:50.162 --> 38:51.461
<i>- Yeah, and you gotta imagine</i>

38:51.463 --> 38:52.762
<i>he's making
his family proud right now,</i>

38:52.764 --> 38:54.764
<i>already at the fourth obstacle.</i>

38:54.766 --> 38:56.299
<i>- And this is a good pace
he's got going,</i>

38:56.301 --> 38:58.902
<i>but the trampoline here
at the Wall Drop can be tough</i>

38:58.904 --> 39:01.071
<i>if you don't have
obstacle experience.</i>

39:04.609 --> 39:06.743
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh, the electrician.</i>

39:06.745 --> 39:11.014
<i>- Did he touch the water?
- How did he keep his feet dry?</i>

39:11.016 --> 39:13.683
<i>- I have no idea.
- This is a guy</i>

39:13.685 --> 39:15.852
<i>that doesn't get to spend
a lot of time at the gym.</i>

39:15.854 --> 39:19.155
<i>He's a blue-collar guy,
already at the fifth obstacle.</i>

39:19.157 --> 39:21.091
<i>He is grounded!</i>

39:21.093 --> 39:22.359
<i>- If you're gonna
put on a performance</i>

39:22.361 --> 39:23.693
<i>as an electrician,</i>

39:23.695 --> 39:26.496
<i>why not do it in front
of a big old power plant?</i>

39:26.498 --> 39:30.133
<i>- And he continues on...
John Gowder, Jr.</i>

39:30.135 --> 39:32.168
<i>- And he was smart, Matt.</i>

39:32.170 --> 39:34.003
<i>By getting to
the Rolling Thunder quickly,</i>

39:34.005 --> 39:37.140
<i>he got a good chance
of staying in the top 30.</i>

39:38.844 --> 39:40.510
<i>- But he's slowing down here.</i>

39:40.512 --> 39:44.414
<i>Oh, I think the electrician
is running out of juice.</i>

39:44.416 --> 39:46.149
<i>- Oh!</i>

39:47.152 --> 39:49.452
<i>John Gowder, Jr.
goes down,</i>

39:49.454 --> 39:52.789
<i>but a strong run
for the 34-year-old rookie.</i>

39:52.791 --> 39:55.191
<i>- Well, check this out again
at the wall drop.</i>

39:55.193 --> 39:56.960
<i>Gowder hits the trampoline,</i>

39:56.962 --> 39:59.429
<i>and it blasts him
right past the tubes.</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:01.564
<i>But he clawed
his way back up,</i>

40:01.566 --> 40:04.801
<i>and that should be enough
to get him into the finals.</i>

40:04.803 --> 40:06.836
<i>- Right now, he's standing
by with Kristine.</i>

40:06.838 --> 40:08.171
- John,
"American Ninja Warrior"

40:08.173 --> 40:10.306
has brought you
and your father closer.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.675
How cool is it having him here
on the sidelines for you?

40:12.677 --> 40:14.010
- It's the experience
of a lifetime.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.479
I just... I wouldn't share it
with anybody else.

40:16.481 --> 40:20.316
- How proud are you of your son?
- Ah, I just...

40:20.318 --> 40:23.486
I don't know what to say.
I love you.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.021
- We'll let you guys
enjoy this moment.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.190
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.
- Thank you.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.292
<i>- Well, it's almost time
for Geoff Britten.</i>

40:29.294 --> 40:31.761
<i>His run's just ahead.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:33.563
<i>And if you want to see
the Britten family's road</i>

40:33.565 --> 40:35.732
<i>to Philadelphia,
check out our digital series,</i>

40:35.734 --> 40:40.637
<i>"24/B4," available on the NBC
app and at NBC.com.</i>

40:40.639 --> 40:43.773
<i>Also coming up,
John Loobey is pure country,</i>

40:43.775 --> 40:46.810
<i>and this 64-year-old
Sunday school teacher</i>

40:46.812 --> 40:48.678
<i>thinks
he can finish the course.</i>

40:48.680 --> 40:50.013
- Why else would I be here?

40:50.015 --> 40:53.116
<i>- When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

40:56.487 --> 40:58.354
<i>- Welcome to our qualifying
course</i>

40:58.356 --> 41:00.256
<i>here in historic
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,</i>

41:00.258 --> 41:02.158
<i>where the Declaration
of Independence</i>

41:02.160 --> 41:05.061
<i>was signed in 1776.</i>

41:05.063 --> 41:08.264
<i>- And speaking of historic...
- no, that's not a lost grandpa</i>

41:08.266 --> 41:09.866
<i>shuffling to the start line.</i>

41:09.868 --> 41:14.103
<i>It's our next athlete,
64-year-old John Loobey.</i>

41:14.105 --> 41:16.439
<i>- Oh, he's doing dips!
- Say what?</i>

41:16.441 --> 41:20.043
<i>- As you can tell, this is
not your average 64 year old.</i>

41:20.045 --> 41:22.912
<i>Loobey is a tool salesman
from Bristol, Tennessee,</i>

41:22.914 --> 41:26.850
<i>and he calls himself
the Geriatric Ninja.</i>

41:29.654 --> 41:31.721
- I like the slow pace
of country living.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.424
<i>I love the clean air.</i>

41:34.426 --> 41:36.693
<i>It's good for my lungs,
good for my health.</i>

41:36.695 --> 41:37.760
It's good for my training.

41:41.433 --> 41:44.868
<i>About age 52, I got involved
with martial arts.</i>

41:46.638 --> 41:49.038
<i>Kung fu means hardworking.</i>

41:49.040 --> 41:52.141
If you're not breaking a sweat,
it's not kung fu.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.945
<i>I don't much like the gym.</i>

41:55.947 --> 41:57.814
My training is
everyday things that we do.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.650
<i>I try to get some speed
walking in, pick raspberries.</i>

42:00.652 --> 42:03.453
<i>Splitting wood's
one of the good ones.</i>

42:03.455 --> 42:05.255
It keeps me in shape,
keeps me going.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.690
<i>I saw "American Ninja Warriors"
on TV,</i>

42:07.692 --> 42:09.659
and I thought,
"I could do this."

42:09.661 --> 42:12.262
<i>Those young guys
with all those muscles,</i>

42:12.264 --> 42:15.198
they don't intimidate me.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.233
<i>Travel to the big city
of Philadelphia,</i>

42:17.235 --> 42:18.801
<i>and I'm running this course
to finish it.</i>

42:18.803 --> 42:20.470
Whey else would I be here?

42:23.475 --> 42:26.409
- Come on, John!
<i>- 64 years old.</i>

42:26.411 --> 42:31.748
<i>- Matt, can you imagine moving
like this at 64 years old?</i>

42:33.718 --> 42:35.818
<i>We've had some memorable
older competitors... guys</i>

42:35.820 --> 42:37.987
<i>like the Chuckster,
Chuck Mammay...</i>

42:37.989 --> 42:39.522
<i>but none of them has
ever made it</i>

42:39.524 --> 42:41.457
<i>past the first obstacle.</i>

42:44.329 --> 42:48.031
<i>He is about
to make history here.</i>

42:48.033 --> 42:50.800
<i>John Loobey, the man
with the walker...</i>

42:50.802 --> 42:52.735
<i>- Oh, oh!</i>

42:52.737 --> 42:54.871
<i>- Oh, he's still having fun here.
- He continues to fight.</i>

42:54.873 --> 42:57.240
<i>- Come on, now.</i>

42:57.242 --> 42:59.375
<i>Come on, you got to go strong.
Go hard.</i>

42:59.377 --> 43:01.644
<i>- Loobey will not give up!</i>

43:01.646 --> 43:04.948
<i>- He's still going, Matt.
- Yes!</i>

43:04.950 --> 43:06.983
- Whoo!

43:06.985 --> 43:09.185
<i>- John Loobey,
the oldest competitor</i>

43:09.187 --> 43:12.555
<i>ever to complete an obstacle.</i>

43:12.557 --> 43:14.190
<i>Well,
he's rolling up his pants.</i>

43:15.527 --> 43:18.261
<i>- Shirt's coming off, ladies.
- Look at this!</i>

43:20.098 --> 43:21.564
- Use your legs... hold on!

43:21.566 --> 43:23.833
<i>- John Loobey,</i>

43:23.835 --> 43:26.502
<i>- on now to Log Grip.
- Hold on, hold on...</i>

43:26.504 --> 43:28.438
<i>- Whoa!
- What?</i>

43:28.440 --> 43:31.274
- Yeah!
<i>- You are not a senior citizen!</i>

43:31.276 --> 43:32.475
<i>You are not!</i>

43:32.477 --> 43:35.144
<i>- Age ain't nothing
but a number</i>

43:35.146 --> 43:37.880
<i>as the 64-year-old
Sunday school teacher</i>

43:37.882 --> 43:39.816
<i>now takes on the Paddle Boards.</i>

43:41.853 --> 43:44.320
<i>- You got this, Loobey!</i>

43:44.322 --> 43:46.089
<i>I'm about to lose my mind!</i>

43:46.091 --> 43:49.158
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

43:49.160 --> 43:51.327
<i>Hey, you know what, I have
to give it up to Loobey.</i>

43:51.329 --> 43:52.729
<i>- No, we all have
to give it up.</i>

43:52.731 --> 43:53.963
<i>- Absolutely.
- I mean,</i>

43:53.965 --> 43:55.465
that was big-time
prime time right there.

43:55.467 --> 43:59.068
- Philadelphia,
this crowd on its feet.

44:00.739 --> 44:01.971
<i>- Check this out.</i>

44:01.973 --> 44:04.874
<i>History is made
as 64-year-old John Loobey</i>

44:04.876 --> 44:06.709
<i>gets past the Floating Steps</i>

44:06.711 --> 44:08.277
<i>and then the Log Grip...</i>

44:08.279 --> 44:11.014
<i>the oldest to make it
that far on the course.</i>

44:11.016 --> 44:13.683
<i>- Let's go down
to Kristine Leahy.</i>

44:13.685 --> 44:16.252
- John,
did you have any idea

44:16.254 --> 44:19.022
that you are officially
the oldest competitor

44:19.024 --> 44:21.958
to make it through not just one,
but two obstacles?

44:21.960 --> 44:24.694
- That's what I was going for.
- Oh, so you knew!

44:24.696 --> 44:27.196
- Actually, three or four
or five, but yeah.

44:27.198 --> 44:29.465
- I mean, talk to me about
those Paddle Boards there.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.834
<i>- What went wrong?
- I honestly don't know.</i>

44:31.836 --> 44:35.071
I may watch the... you know,
the video or something,

44:35.073 --> 44:37.006
and I may still not know.

44:37.008 --> 44:39.509
- You gonna come back
next year at 65?

44:39.511 --> 44:40.843
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.011
I'm glad to hear it,
John.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.246
Hey, he's coming back.

44:43.248 --> 44:45.448
Matt and Akbar,
back to you.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.183
<i>- Well, talk about
making history...</i>

44:47.185 --> 44:49.686
<i>here comes a guy
who knows all about that.</i>

44:49.688 --> 44:51.688
<i>This is Geoff Britten,</i>

44:51.690 --> 44:54.057
<i>one of only two
American Ninja Warriors,</i>

44:54.059 --> 44:57.193
<i>and the first man to climb
Stage 4 in Vegas.</i>

44:57.195 --> 44:58.828
<i>The cameraman
from Olney, Maryland</i>

44:58.830 --> 45:01.497
<i>was three seconds
behind Isaac Caldiero,</i>

45:01.499 --> 45:03.466
<i>so he didn't get
the million dollars,</i>

45:03.468 --> 45:06.636
<i>but he became a celebrity
just the same.</i>

45:06.638 --> 45:09.005
<i>- In my life, I've always been
a private person...</i>

45:09.007 --> 45:12.542
never wanted to be
in front of the camera.

45:12.544 --> 45:14.610
My job is being
behind the camera.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.579
And then, here comes
"American Ninja Warrior."

45:16.581 --> 45:19.048
<i>- Oh boy, he's so close!</i>

45:19.050 --> 45:22.351
<i>He did it!
Geoff Britten did it!</i>

45:22.353 --> 45:23.886
<i>- Oh, my goodness!</i>

45:23.888 --> 45:26.389
<i>- Last season, I got to stand
up on top of the tower</i>

45:26.391 --> 45:29.992
<i>and raise my arms up high,
knowing I was the first person</i>

45:29.994 --> 45:31.794
<i>to ever beat Stage 4.</i>

45:31.796 --> 45:33.463
That was awesome.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.633
<i>Since Las Vegas,
I've done all these interviews.</i>

45:37.635 --> 45:40.336
<i>I've been on radio shows.
Wherever I go, whatever I do,</i>

45:40.338 --> 45:41.704
<i>everyone looks at me
a little differently.</i>

45:41.706 --> 45:43.573
<i>- Yeah, there's
our college Geoff Britten,</i>

45:43.575 --> 45:46.576
<i>who recently became the first
American Ninja Warrior.</i>

45:46.578 --> 45:49.612
<i>- It's a new season,
and I'm gonna focus</i>

45:49.614 --> 45:51.080
<i>and do exactly
what I've always done.</i>

45:51.082 --> 45:52.915
This is the world's
greatest playground,

45:52.917 --> 45:54.751
and I'm here to have fun.

45:56.721 --> 45:58.921
<i>- And there's Geoff's wife
Jessica and his mom,</i>

45:58.923 --> 46:01.124
<i>along with his daughter
and nephew.</i>

46:01.126 --> 46:03.960
<i>And he has lots of new fans
that want to see Geoff Britten.</i>

46:05.530 --> 46:07.063
<i>- Well, this is it.</i>

46:07.065 --> 46:08.731
<i>Is it the start of a return</i>

46:08.733 --> 46:11.434
<i>to the top of Mount Midoriyama?</i>

46:11.436 --> 46:13.169
<i>- Well, there's a lot
of expectations</i>

46:13.171 --> 46:14.871
<i>for Geoff Britten this year.</i>

46:14.873 --> 46:16.506
<i>Everyone is watching him.</i>

46:16.508 --> 46:19.609
<i>But it's not gonna be easy
to get back to Stage 4 again.</i>

46:19.611 --> 46:22.011
<i>- That's right... this season,
the courses are tougher,</i>

46:22.013 --> 46:23.846
<i>with lots of new obstacles.</i>

46:23.848 --> 46:25.648
<i>But making it through
the Log Grip.</i>

46:25.650 --> 46:27.016
<i>Britten has a family</i>

46:27.018 --> 46:28.985
<i>and a full-time job
as a cameraman.</i>

46:28.987 --> 46:30.419
<i>Doesn't get to train
as much as</i>

46:30.421 --> 46:32.789
<i>some of the other top ninjas.</i>

46:32.791 --> 46:34.290
<i>- This guy's a superstar.</i>

46:34.292 --> 46:35.758
<i>Watch him work
the Paddle Boards.</i>

46:35.760 --> 46:37.527
<i>And look at that... whoa!</i>

46:37.529 --> 46:40.363
<i>That was close.</i>

46:40.365 --> 46:43.065
<i>The rest of these obstacles
should line up pretty well</i>

46:43.067 --> 46:46.669
<i>for the man with the legendary
upper-body and grip strength.</i>

46:46.671 --> 46:48.437
<i>- He's got to go all out here.</i>

46:48.439 --> 46:50.873
<i>- He's got those
huge Popeye forearms,</i>

46:50.875 --> 46:54.911
<i>but the upper body can't help
him here with the trampoline.</i>

46:54.913 --> 46:57.814
<i>- So he's got to stay focused
here. You gotta succeed.</i>

46:57.816 --> 46:59.615
<i>You gotta succeed as bad
as you wanna breathe.</i>

46:59.617 --> 47:01.150
<i>There you go, baby.</i>

47:01.152 --> 47:03.386
<i>- And you can see him now
making his way down the log</i>

47:03.388 --> 47:05.888
<i>to assist with that dismount.</i>

47:05.890 --> 47:07.657
<i>- This is where you got
to hold on.</i>

47:07.659 --> 47:10.593
<i>You see your forearms there?
Use those Popeye forearms...</i>

47:10.595 --> 47:12.161
<i>everything you have...
to hold on.</i>

47:12.163 --> 47:13.596
<i>- What I like is,
he's struggling,</i>

47:13.598 --> 47:16.065
<i>but look at his face.
He looks completely calm.</i>

47:19.137 --> 47:21.404
<i>His wife Jessica
looks a bit nervous,</i>

47:21.406 --> 47:22.939
<i>but he blows her a kiss</i>

47:22.941 --> 47:25.441
<i>as if to say,
"Everything's okay."</i>

47:25.443 --> 47:28.211
<i>- Now Rolling Thunder.
- And he's up.</i>

47:28.213 --> 47:30.046
<i>He's wrestled
with Mount Midoriyama.</i>

47:30.048 --> 47:31.981
<i>Now he's got to wrestle
with this thunder.</i>

47:31.983 --> 47:33.182
<i>- Interestingly, though,</i>

47:33.184 --> 47:35.284
<i>his pace
to this point not that fast.</i>

47:35.286 --> 47:36.986
<i>- But it doesn't matter
how fast he goes,</i>

47:36.988 --> 47:38.588
<i>as long as he's effective.</i>

47:38.590 --> 47:40.122
<i>- Absolutely.
- He has to be effective here,</i>

47:40.124 --> 47:41.958
<i>and he's got to conquer
Rolling Thunder.</i>

47:41.960 --> 47:43.426
<i>Look at him,
using a little bit</i>

47:43.428 --> 47:45.228
<i>of lightening speed here
on Rolling Thunder.</i>

47:45.230 --> 47:48.431
<i>- Rolling Thunder coming
in here like an F-5, man.</i>

47:48.433 --> 47:49.932
<i>This is impressive.</i>

47:49.934 --> 47:52.602
<i>Look at those Vise
grips... those hands.</i>

47:52.604 --> 47:54.337
<i>- But listen, Matt.
- Do you hear that, Matt?</i>

47:54.339 --> 47:57.139
<i>Do you hear the big boom
from the thunder?</i>

47:57.141 --> 48:00.610
<i>That thunder is Geoff Britten,
because that boy's got talent.</i>

48:00.612 --> 48:02.211
<i>Get off of that
Rolling Thunder!</i>

48:02.213 --> 48:04.480
<i>- And he's going
for the dismount here, Akbar.</i>

48:04.482 --> 48:06.182
<i>A little awkward, though.</i>

48:06.184 --> 48:09.518
<i>But he's through!
Geoff Britten,</i>

48:09.520 --> 48:13.923
<i>14 1/2 feet away
from hitting the first buzzer</i>

48:13.925 --> 48:16.759
<i>in what he hopes to be
a return journey</i>

48:16.761 --> 48:19.128
<i>to the top of Mount Midoriyama.</i>

48:19.130 --> 48:21.530
Beat that wall!
Beat that wall! Beat that wall!

48:21.532 --> 48:23.165
- Yeah, baby!

48:23.167 --> 48:25.067
<i>- Well, you know the Brittens</i>

48:25.069 --> 48:27.303
<i>have not had much luck
in Philadelphia,</i>

48:27.305 --> 48:30.406
<i>- but it starts right now!
- Yes, he can!</i>

48:30.408 --> 48:32.375
<i>It starts right now!
Number one.</i>

48:32.377 --> 48:33.709
<i>Hit that thing again.</i>

48:33.711 --> 48:35.845
- Whoo!

48:37.749 --> 48:42.718
<i>- Geoff Britten,
the first step back.</i>

48:42.720 --> 48:44.854
Geoff Britten is moving on.

48:44.856 --> 48:46.956
- Wow, that was hard!

48:46.958 --> 48:50.526
<i>- You want to know
how tough Rolling Thunder is?</i>

48:50.528 --> 48:53.963
<i>Look at Geoff Britten.
But he still gets the finish.</i>

48:53.965 --> 48:56.265
<i>That's the seventh
straight buzzer,</i>

48:56.267 --> 48:58.200
<i>and that's a new record.</i>

48:58.202 --> 49:00.970
<i>- And he's standing
by with Kristine.</i>

49:00.972 --> 49:02.104
- Geoff,
I think you just said

49:02.106 --> 49:03.439
that this is the hardest
qualifying course

49:03.441 --> 49:04.807
you've ever seen.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.275
- That was definitely
the hardest qualifying course

49:06.277 --> 49:07.410
I've ever done.
Look at me.

49:07.412 --> 49:08.911
I'm out of breath.
I'm pumped.

49:08.913 --> 49:11.047
<i>- And you're the first
American Ninja Warrior.</i>

49:11.049 --> 49:12.515
<i>How do you deal
with the pressure?</i>

49:12.517 --> 49:14.617
Because I think you,
out of all the competitors,

49:14.619 --> 49:16.452
probably have the most
pressure on you.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.354
- I think I have
the least pressure on me.

49:18.356 --> 49:20.189
- Oh, that's a great way
to look at it.

49:20.191 --> 49:23.693
- I've already done it.
- Confidence, I like it.

49:23.695 --> 49:25.528
All right, so what do you want
to change, if anything,

49:25.530 --> 49:26.829
about the city finals
course?

49:26.831 --> 49:28.731
- I want them to take away
obstacle number five.

49:28.733 --> 49:31.434
- All right, I'll make a call.
- We'll see if that can happen.

49:31.436 --> 49:33.002
I kind of doubt it,
just to let you know.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.804
But it's always great
seeing you out here.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.772
Congratulations on your first
button, Geoff.

49:36.774 --> 49:39.575
- Thank you.
- Guys, back to you.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.445
<i>- So Geoff Britten jumps
onto the leaderboard</i>

49:42.447 --> 49:44.280
<i>after hitting yet
another buzzer.</i>

49:44.282 --> 49:46.949
<i>And right now, we've got two
women near the top,</i>

49:46.951 --> 49:50.252
<i>with Rachael Goldstein
and Allyssa Beird.</i>

49:50.254 --> 49:51.821
<i>We'll have to wait
to see if their time</i>

49:51.823 --> 49:55.391
<i>keeps them in the top 30
by the end of the night.</i>

49:55.393 --> 49:58.060
<i>And we've got another strong
female competitor coming up.</i>

49:58.062 --> 50:00.730
<i>It's Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

50:00.732 --> 50:02.832
<i>This track star
turned ninja hopeful</i>

50:02.834 --> 50:05.735
<i>takes the course
in just a few minutes.</i>

50:05.737 --> 50:08.838
<i>Plus, he's come close
to winning it all.</i>

50:08.840 --> 50:10.339
<i>- He's got it!</i>

50:10.341 --> 50:13.909
<i>- Now, Joe Moravsky
has extra motivation.</i>

50:13.911 --> 50:15.511
- I'm gonna go further
than ever.

50:15.513 --> 50:19.749
<i>- His run's coming up
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

50:24.721 --> 50:28.057
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Philadelphia.</i>

50:28.059 --> 50:30.292
<i>While we were away,
three more competitors</i>

50:30.294 --> 50:32.328
<i>took a shot at the course.</i>

50:32.330 --> 50:34.096
<i>Engineer Eliannah Hunderfund</i>

50:34.098 --> 50:36.198
<i>made a great
save at the Paddle Boards.</i>

50:36.200 --> 50:40.069
<i>- Oh!
- But the former college diver</i>

50:40.071 --> 50:42.938
<i>dove head first
at the Wall Drop.</i>

50:42.940 --> 50:45.374
<i>- Oh, Hunderfund takes a dip!</i>

50:45.376 --> 50:47.343
<i>- Dan Liburd
is the strength coach</i>

50:47.345 --> 50:49.378
<i>for the NFL's Buffalo Bills.</i>

50:49.380 --> 50:51.647
<i>- You got a body like that,
show it.</i>

50:51.649 --> 50:53.716
<i>- But even
he couldn't muscle his way</i>

50:53.718 --> 50:55.284
<i>past Rolling Thunder.</i>

50:55.286 --> 50:57.887
<i>- Oh!</i>

50:57.889 --> 51:00.956
<i>DC firefighter Mike Bernardo
came out strong.</i>

51:02.760 --> 51:06.028
<i>- But the seven-time veteran
made a rookie mistake.</i>

51:06.030 --> 51:09.031
<i>- Oh, he's going
for the dismount... no!</i>

51:09.033 --> 51:11.600
<i>- When his toe hit
the water at Rolling Thunder.</i>

51:11.602 --> 51:13.869
<i>- Sha na na!</i>

51:13.871 --> 51:15.671
<i>- Up next, another one</i>

51:15.673 --> 51:17.907
<i>of our promising
female competitors,</i>

51:17.909 --> 51:19.675
<i>this is Jessie Labreck.</i>

51:19.677 --> 51:22.645
<i>Or, as her friends call her,
Flex Labreck.</i>

51:22.647 --> 51:25.247
<i>- She's taking her shirt off.
- And with those muscles,</i>

51:25.249 --> 51:27.183
<i>you can see why.</i>

51:27.185 --> 51:29.185
<i>A year ago, this former
track star moved from Maine</i>

51:29.187 --> 51:30.486
<i>to the Boston area</i>

51:30.488 --> 51:32.822
<i>to concentrate
on ninja training.</i>

51:32.824 --> 51:34.190
<i>It's also when she took a job</i>

51:34.192 --> 51:37.326
<i>as a caregiver
for her number-one fan.</i>

51:37.328 --> 51:39.495
- I didn't ask if you wanted
Indian braids or regular,

51:39.497 --> 51:42.998
but we're going reg,
so I hope that's okay with you.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.601
<i>I am a full-time nanny working
with a 20-year-old girl</i>

51:45.603 --> 51:46.969
<i>with cerebral palsy.</i>

51:46.971 --> 51:50.806
Her name is Emeline,
and she is just amazing.

51:50.808 --> 51:52.541
Em, your hair's getting so long.

51:52.543 --> 51:53.742
Ooh!

51:56.547 --> 51:58.214
<i>She can't use her arms
or her legs,</i>

51:58.216 --> 52:00.883
<i>and she can't speak.</i>

52:00.885 --> 52:03.085
<i>Emeline communicates
with her computer.</i>

52:03.087 --> 52:06.222
<i>She has a little dot on her
glasses that moves her mouse.</i>

52:07.925 --> 52:10.192
<i>Emeline and I
will go to the park.</i>

52:10.194 --> 52:12.394
<i>I do her hair.
We'll go swimming.</i>

52:12.396 --> 52:15.664
So do you think we should go
to the pool and the swing today?

52:15.666 --> 52:18.000
- Yes, definitely.

52:21.706 --> 52:23.272
- My job with Em
has definitely given me

52:23.274 --> 52:25.975
a different outlook on life.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.710
<i>Things that I've taken
for granted,</i>

52:27.712 --> 52:29.345
<i>like itching your nose</i>

52:29.347 --> 52:31.580
<i>or your ear...
she can't just do that.</i>

52:33.184 --> 52:36.318
<i>But she is always laughing.
She's always in a good mood.</i>

52:36.320 --> 52:38.287
<i>And it's infectious.</i>

52:38.289 --> 52:41.991
- Jesse is crazy lovable
and definitely a weirdo.

52:45.296 --> 52:47.763
<i>- Emeline is very
excited tonight.</i>

52:47.765 --> 52:49.932
<i>She can't wait to see me.</i>

52:49.934 --> 52:52.535
- Jesse will
crush the course.

52:52.537 --> 52:54.803
<i>- She's been saying how proud
she is of me,</i>

52:54.805 --> 52:58.874
which makes me really happy.

53:01.145 --> 53:04.113
Um, I'm glad
that I make her proud,

53:04.115 --> 53:06.448
<i>'cause I'm proud of her, so...</i>

53:08.920 --> 53:10.419
<i>I think everything happens
for a reason,</i>

53:10.421 --> 53:13.322
<i>and I have no idea what my life
would be like right now,</i>

53:13.324 --> 53:16.225
<i>but I know it wouldn't be
as amazing without Em.</i>

53:19.697 --> 53:22.698
<i>- And there is Emeline
on the sidelines,</i>

53:22.700 --> 53:25.501
<i>alongside Jesse's father
and her boyfriend.</i>

53:25.503 --> 53:27.570
<i>And she's got a huge group
of supporters</i>

53:27.572 --> 53:29.939
<i>sporting those
Flex Lebreck T-shirts.</i>

53:29.941 --> 53:32.174
<i>- Well, here we go.
- She's 5'7",</i>

53:32.176 --> 53:34.410
<i>the tallest woman
we'll see tonight.</i>

53:34.412 --> 53:35.945
<i>- Well, she was
a record-setting</i>

53:35.947 --> 53:37.913
<i>track and field collegiate
star.</i>

53:37.915 --> 53:40.115
<i>Still holds 11
school records</i>

53:40.117 --> 53:42.151
<i>at the University of Maine.</i>

53:44.222 --> 53:45.554
<i>- Wow!
- What a push.</i>

53:45.556 --> 53:47.590
<i>This is a strong woman here.</i>

53:47.592 --> 53:49.358
<i>- That's because of her
background.</i>

53:49.360 --> 53:51.460
<i>She was a sprinter.
She was a high jumper.</i>

53:51.462 --> 53:53.229
<i>She is a well-rounded athlete.</i>

53:53.231 --> 53:56.899
<i>- Locked on.
- Oh, and she barely budged.</i>

53:58.536 --> 54:02.805
<i>Flex Lebreck and Emeline
smiling says it all, really.</i>

54:02.807 --> 54:05.941
<i>- Keep it hot here. Let... nice.
- Look at... wow!</i>

54:05.943 --> 54:09.144
<i>- That was so smooth!</i>

54:10.281 --> 54:12.448
<i>- And now onto the Wall Drop.</i>

54:12.450 --> 54:14.550
<i>- This is where she can use her
upper-body strength</i>

54:14.552 --> 54:16.619
<i>to climb up here,
and then I think her height</i>

54:16.621 --> 54:18.354
<i>will help her
on the trampoline.</i>

54:18.356 --> 54:20.122
<i>- Remember, she is a rookie.</i>

54:20.124 --> 54:21.657
<i>It's her first time
on the course,</i>

54:21.659 --> 54:23.626
<i>but she's looking
like a veteran.</i>

54:23.628 --> 54:27.229
<i>- Wow.
- And Emeline is loving it.</i>

54:27.231 --> 54:28.497
<i>- There's a new kid
on the block,</i>

54:28.499 --> 54:30.399
<i>and her name is Jesse Labreck.</i>

54:30.401 --> 54:32.568
<i>She's taking down
each obstacle right now.</i>

54:32.570 --> 54:34.169
<i>- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoa!</i>

54:34.171 --> 54:35.638
<i>- Did you see that? She's like
Michael Jordan in the air!</i>

54:35.640 --> 54:37.006
<i>- My goodness!</i>

54:37.008 --> 54:38.173
<i>- Game time!</i>

54:38.175 --> 54:40.309
<i>- She almost jumped out
of the gym!</i>

54:40.311 --> 54:42.044
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

54:42.046 --> 54:44.813
<i>- What perfect technique
on the trampoline.</i>

54:47.218 --> 54:49.451
<i>- She was up in the air
for, like, ten seconds.</i>

54:49.453 --> 54:51.320
<i>- And gets a leg on,
spinning around.</i>

54:51.322 --> 54:53.656
<i>- Use them abs to pull you
back over there.</i>

54:53.658 --> 54:56.659
<i>- Well, every year,
we have breakout stars...</i>

54:56.661 --> 54:58.961
<i>unknowns
who come to shock us.</i>

54:58.963 --> 55:01.964
<i>Could it be
Jesse "Flex" Labreck?</i>

55:01.966 --> 55:04.300
- Jesse! Jesse!

55:04.302 --> 55:07.803
<i>- This Rolling Thunder wheel
weighs over 100 pounds.</i>

55:07.805 --> 55:11.173
<i>We are gonna see what kind
of strength Flex really has.</i>

55:11.175 --> 55:12.908
Flex! Flex!
Flex! Flex!

55:12.910 --> 55:17.846
<i>- Wow, these women
are tearing it up tonight.</i>

55:17.848 --> 55:20.816
<i>- And look at the power
in Flex Labreck.</i>

55:20.818 --> 55:24.153
<i>- Yeah, Labreck,
she's a la-brick house.</i>

55:24.155 --> 55:26.155
<i>- She is mighty mighty,</i>

55:26.157 --> 55:29.625
<i>and letting it all hang out
on the Rolling Thunder.</i>

55:29.627 --> 55:32.294
<i>- Oh, boy.
- "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."</i>

55:32.296 --> 55:34.863
<i>And you can see she's feeling
the pain right now,</i>

55:34.865 --> 55:37.266
<i>but that's all right...
crying all the way through.</i>

55:37.268 --> 55:38.400
<i>Cry it out.
Cry it out, bro.</i>

55:38.402 --> 55:40.402
<i>- Oh! One hand!
- Hang on!</i>

55:40.404 --> 55:41.537
<i>Hang on!
She's gonna recover!</i>

55:41.539 --> 55:44.640
<i>- Get back up!
- She's gonna recover!</i>

55:44.642 --> 55:46.875
<i>- Incredible effort, and she's
going in on the Plexiglas.</i>

55:46.877 --> 55:48.744
<i>- Wow!
- Hang on!</i>

55:48.746 --> 55:51.380
<i>Another recovery!</i>

55:51.382 --> 55:52.614
<i>You got to want it!</i>

55:52.616 --> 55:55.484
<i>If you want to succeed,
you got to get it.</i>

55:57.688 --> 56:00.322
<i>- Not allowed
to use her legs here.</i>

56:00.324 --> 56:04.493
<i>Jesse "Flex" Labreck refusing
to give in.</i>

56:06.797 --> 56:09.298
<i>She is hung up.
What can she do?</i>

56:09.300 --> 56:11.600
<i>Just loses her grip.</i>

56:13.204 --> 56:15.471
<i>- Well, she may not have
hit the buzzer,</i>

56:15.473 --> 56:18.240
<i>but a breakout performance
by Labreck.</i>

56:18.242 --> 56:20.843
<i>She's got a good chance
of staying in the top 30.</i>

56:20.845 --> 56:23.679
<i>We could have three women
in the city finals,</i>

56:23.681 --> 56:26.215
<i>something that has
never happened before.</i>

56:26.217 --> 56:28.650
<i>- Look at Labreck
on the trampoline.</i>

56:28.652 --> 56:31.520
<i>That's as high as anyone
we've seen.</i>

56:31.522 --> 56:34.223
<i>And at Rolling Thunder,
she drops to one arm,</i>

56:34.225 --> 56:35.591
<i>but look at her face.</i>

56:35.593 --> 56:39.828
<i>She never panicked.
Flex Labreck is a star.</i>

56:39.830 --> 56:42.197
<i>And right now
she's down with Kristine.</i>

56:43.300 --> 56:46.201
- Jesse, you looked
amazing out there.

56:46.203 --> 56:47.436
You did such a great job,

56:47.438 --> 56:49.638
and I could tell you
were trying your hardest

56:49.640 --> 56:50.906
to make it through
the Rolling Thunder.

56:50.908 --> 56:53.108
Tell me, what kind of things
are going through your mind?

56:53.110 --> 56:55.711
- I'm just thinking, "Keep
going, keep that knee drive,

56:55.713 --> 56:58.414
<i>just get to the next Plexiglas
and then reach really big."</i>

56:58.416 --> 57:00.783
<i>And that last one,
I just couldn't reach higher.</i>

57:00.785 --> 57:03.185
- Emeline loves being out here.
- She was cheering for you.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.320
What does that mean to you, to
have her support here with you?

57:05.322 --> 57:06.655
- It just makes me so happy

57:06.657 --> 57:08.490
that she could come
and that she's here.

57:08.492 --> 57:10.058
And I'm glad that she's
just excited about it

57:10.060 --> 57:11.460
and she's proud of me, so...

57:11.462 --> 57:13.228
- We're proud of you too,
and I am really

57:13.230 --> 57:14.663
hoping that you made it
far enough fast enough

57:14.665 --> 57:16.098
so we can see you both back
in the city finals.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.232
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

57:17.234 --> 57:18.500
- We'll let you guys
enjoy it together.

57:18.502 --> 57:20.335
Matt and Akbar, back up to you.

57:20.337 --> 57:24.139
<i>- Coming up, Ryan Stratis
is coming off major surgery.</i>

57:24.141 --> 57:25.874
- I'm taking you down,
mountain.

57:25.876 --> 57:27.709
<i>- But he's still gonna
try this course.</i>

57:27.711 --> 57:28.710
- Nice.

57:28.712 --> 57:29.878
<i>- His run's coming up...</i>

57:30.881 --> 57:33.582
<i>- On "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

57:37.187 --> 57:39.922
<i>- Welcome back to Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,</i>

57:39.924 --> 57:42.591
<i>here in the shadow
of the Betsy Ross Bridge.</i>

57:42.593 --> 57:44.893
And that is fitting
because tonight,

57:44.895 --> 57:48.730
we've seen some strong women
flying their flags.

57:48.732 --> 57:51.633
<i>- First, it was
rookie Rachael Goldestein.</i>

57:51.635 --> 57:53.168
<i>- Look at her!</i>

57:53.170 --> 57:56.171
<i>- Then Massachusetts teacher
Allyssa Beird.</i>

57:56.173 --> 57:58.106
<i>- Right through it.</i>

57:58.108 --> 58:01.310
<i>- And then another rookie,
Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

58:01.312 --> 58:03.779
<i>- Look at the power
in Flex Labreck!</i>

58:03.781 --> 58:06.248
<i>- All three made it
to the fifth obstacle,</i>

58:06.250 --> 58:09.685
<i>and all three have a shot
to stay in the top 30.</i>

58:09.687 --> 58:13.655
<i>We've never had three women
advance to a city finals.</i>

58:13.657 --> 58:16.158
<i>- And one of our top women,
Michelle Warnky,</i>

58:16.160 --> 58:17.793
<i>has yet to take the course,</i>

58:17.795 --> 58:21.096
<i>so we could even have
four women moving on.</i>

58:22.032 --> 58:23.298
<i>At the start line right now,</i>

58:23.300 --> 58:25.734
<i>one of the most
exciting athletes out here.</i>

58:25.736 --> 58:30.305
<i>It's the giant 6'6"
Jon Alexis, Jr.</i>

58:30.307 --> 58:32.574
<i>Now living in Newton,
Massachusetts,</i>

58:32.576 --> 58:33.742
<i>he put up the fastest time</i>

58:33.744 --> 58:37.045
<i>in qualifying in Orlando
last year.</i>

58:37.047 --> 58:38.580
<i>- Uh-oh, in a track spirit.</i>

58:38.582 --> 58:41.650
<i>Uh-oh, look at the big fella,
6'6" in a track stance!</i>

58:41.652 --> 58:42.951
<i>I see that coming out
the block strong.</i>

58:42.953 --> 58:44.386
<i>- You can do that at 6'6".</i>

58:44.388 --> 58:46.388
<i>And honestly he's going fast,</i>

58:46.390 --> 58:48.557
<i>but there may be
some design to this, Akbar.</i>

58:48.559 --> 58:51.093
<i>- Whoo!
- He may well know</i>

58:51.095 --> 58:53.128
<i>it could come down
to farthest the fastest.</i>

58:53.130 --> 58:56.465
<i>- Uh-oh, look at the big fella.
- Oh, Jolly Green Giant!</i>

58:56.467 --> 58:59.535
<i>- Oh!
- I see you, baby!</i>

59:00.804 --> 59:02.905
<i>Matt, he's wasting
absolutely no time.</i>

59:02.907 --> 59:04.740
<i>Look at the big 6'6" fella,</i>

59:04.742 --> 59:07.209
<i>rolling like he done
lost his mind!</i>

59:09.013 --> 59:11.914
- Stay firm!
- Stay firm!

59:11.916 --> 59:14.816
<i>- And look at that bounce!</i>

59:14.818 --> 59:17.986
<i>- Oh!</i>

59:17.988 --> 59:20.556
<i>- He's got his dad here
and a big group of supporters,</i>

59:20.558 --> 59:22.724
<i>but they can barely
keep up with him.</i>

59:23.894 --> 59:25.594
<i>Came out of nowhere
last year as a rookie,</i>

59:25.596 --> 59:27.729
<i>put up the fastest time
in Orlando,</i>

59:27.731 --> 59:31.266
<i>and he's obviously
going for it again.</i>

59:31.268 --> 59:33.001
<i>- Well, Matt,
the Rolling Thunder here</i>

59:33.003 --> 59:34.269
<i>is definitely gonna go</i>

59:34.271 --> 59:36.171
<i>to the advantage
of a guy like Alexis.</i>

59:36.173 --> 59:37.539
<i>Now, he's got long arms,</i>

59:37.541 --> 59:41.276
<i>so he can reach back past
the Plexiglas there</i>

59:41.278 --> 59:42.511
<i>on the third spoke.</i>

59:42.513 --> 59:44.613
<i>Every third spoke
has that Plexiglas.</i>

59:44.615 --> 59:46.181
<i>Look at him
showing off his strength.</i>

59:46.183 --> 59:49.084
<i>- But keep in mind,
he's 193 pounds,</i>

59:49.086 --> 59:51.687
<i>so his grip strength
is really being taxed.</i>

59:51.689 --> 59:52.788
<i>And there it is, the Plexi...</i>

59:52.790 --> 59:54.323
<i>- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Reach back, big fella!</i>

59:54.325 --> 59:55.791
<i>- And even at 6'6", he's having
trouble with the reach.</i>

59:55.793 --> 59:58.093
<i>- Reach back, big fella!
- Going for the dismount!</i>

59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.763
<i>- I say fly backwards.
- Fly backwards, Alexis!</i>

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.498
<i>No, don't fool with it.
Don't fool with it. Get off!</i>

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.603
<i>- The giant, can he do it?
- Come on, big fella!</i>

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:09.838
<i>You're hanging over the water!</i>

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.374
<i>Well, Matt,
I think he's going down.</i>

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:13.742
<i>Come on, just fly backwards!
Let's go!</i>

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:17.179
<i>- John Alexis... his feet
are over the landing platform.</i>

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:19.081
<i>- Matt, he's only about
5 inches from the water.</i>

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.115
<i>Go!
Oh!</i>

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.518
- Ohh!
- Ahh, I see you big fella!

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.254
- The big man does it!
- I see you, big fella!

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:29.091
<i>- And right up the Warped Wall!
- I see you, big dog!</i>

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.759
<i>- But look at the fatigue.</i>

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:36.398
<i>Ohh!</i>

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.966
<i>- I see you doing
the cat daddy!</i>

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.035
I see you doing the cat daddy!

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:43.005
<i>- The giant with the biggest
run thus far...</i>

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.440
<i>fastest time of the night!</i>

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:46.508
<i>- My goodness.</i>

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.276
<i>He took off like a sprinter</i>

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:51.113
<i>and used those long legs
on the Floating Steps.</i>

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.348
<i>And look at him
on Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.550
<i>He's still way
out over the water,</i>

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:58.654
<i>but with his height,
he just steps off.</i>

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.456
<i>- Well, up next, one of
the most popular ninja athletes</i>

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.058
<i>of all time.</i>

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.461
<i>From Kennesaw, Georgia,
this is Ryan Stratis.</i>

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:09.665
<i>He's one of the few to compete
in all eight seasons,</i>

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.133
<i>but he almost didn't
make it this year</i>

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:15.270
<i>because he's coming off
a very serious injury.</i>

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.571
<i>- I've been competing
with a bad shoulder</i>

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:17.906
<i>for a couple years now,</i>

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:20.709
<i>and I was just trying to fight
through the pain.</i>

01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:22.010
My shoulder was one of
the reasons

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:25.981
why I fell at the Salmon Ladder
in Las Vegas last year.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.383
Oh!

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.185
<i>- When I went to get
my shoulder checked</i>

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.520
<i>and they saw
how bad it was,</i>

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.256
<i>they said I needed surgery
immediately.</i>

01:01:34.258 --> 01:01:36.324
I'm taking you down, mountain.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:39.528
After the surgery, going through
the rehab... it was grueling, man.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.733
- He couldn't do his stunts.
- He couldn't work at the gym.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.702
<i>He was really down.</i>

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:49.571
- But I knew baby steps
wasn't gonna get me back

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:51.206
to where I was
and stronger than before.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.476
And when it was tough, I was
just thinking about everybody

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.745
that loves watching me
on the show.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:59.014
<i>I only have one month to
get ready for this competition,</i>

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.550
<i>but muscle memory's
coming back pretty quick.</i>

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:05.721
<i>Going into it, I got to block
out all the doubt</i>

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:07.089
<i>and just fight on through.</i>

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.526
<i>- Well, his boss, Glenn Davis,
is here,</i>

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.595
<i>along with Ryan's
rehab therapist,</i>

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:16.898
<i>plus his pals Mike Bernardo
and James McGrath...</i>

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.734
<i>a lot of people worried
about this run.</i>

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:21.903
- Let's get this, Strat!
- Come on!

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.439
<i>- You can see him really
putting a little focus there</i>

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.440
<i>on the shoulder.</i>

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:29.444
<i>- Well, it's amazing. He had
surgery just four months ago,</i>

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.980
<i>but has worked so hard
to get back into shape.</i>

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.316
<i>That shoulder will be tested
on this course.</i>

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:35.717
<i>- And here's the thing,
though, Matt.</i>

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:37.986
<i>Not everyone
gets to compete at 100%.</i>

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.155
<i>We know he's not at 100%.</i>

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.823
- Get up there, Strat!
- Get up there!

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.291
<i>- Well, Stratis has been around</i>

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.827
<i>since the very beginning
of "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:48.797
<i>so well-liked
by his fellow athletes.</i>

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:51.399
<i>- He understands the spirit
of this sport perhaps</i>

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.568
<i>- as well as anyone.
- Check him out.</i>

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.071
<i>He's already feeling that
shoulder. That's not good.</i>

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:57.572
- Come on, Strat!
- Quick feet!

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.809
<i>- Oh!</i>

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.711
<i>- Oh-ho, and he survives.</i>

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:05.147
<i>- Boy, he's lucky he's safe.
- He's safe.</i>

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:06.314
- Yeah!

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.750
<i>- Not pretty,
but he survived it.</i>

01:03:08.752 --> 01:03:10.118
- You got this, Ryan!

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.087
<i>- But now the first real test
for his shoulder</i>

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:13.955
<i>- at the Wall Drop.</i>
- Just like the gym, man.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.390
Here we go.

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:17.759
<i>- And the crowd starting up
a chant.</i>

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:21.163
<i>- Well, this is all upper body.</i>

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.864
<i>- Oh, but look at him!</i>

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:25.634
<i>He's fighting
his way through it.</i>

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:30.172
- Get it, get it,
get it, get it!

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:33.241
<i>- Has to be careful
on the trampoline.</i>

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:34.743
<i>- Oh, oh, ooh.</i>

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:37.646
<i>- Hanging on,
and he's gonna get through!</i>

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.949
<i>- You can see he favored
the left shoulder there.</i>

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.350
<i>And look at that... that shoulder
is injured, Akbar.</i>

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.686
<i>- Oh, man, he went
into that tackle pretty hard.</i>

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:46.188
<i>Yeah, take another look
at this again.</i>

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.323
<i>You see him.
He gets there a little uneven...</i>

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.791
<i>right foot then left foot,</i>

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:52.861
<i>and then goes shoulder first
into the tackling dummy.</i>

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:54.796
<i>You know he's got to be
in pain.</i>

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:57.999
<i>- Well, the surgery on that
right shoulder was extensive.</i>

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.901
<i>The doctors went
and shaved down the bone.</i>

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:01.436
<i>- Ooh, yikes.</i>

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:05.340
<i>Rolling Thunder is not gonna
be fun with a bad shoulder.</i>

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.876
<i>- But look at him!
- He is attacking this obstacle.</i>

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:08.977
- Big reach!
- Big reach!

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.745
<i>- Wow.</i>
- Good grab! Good grab!

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:11.980
<i>- Where did this come from?</i>

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:14.382
<i>How is he fighting
through the pain?</i>

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.751
<i>- Keep the Ls... if you want
to keep pressure off</i>

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:18.787
<i>of your shoulder, keep the Ls.</i>

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:21.356
- Big reach!
- Big reach!

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.928
<i>- This is all heart, Matt.</i>

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.064
<i>I don't know if he can
keep this up.</i>

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.434
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:34.736
<i>This is what a veteran does!</i>

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.374
- Come on, one more!
- One more!

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.443
<i>- He's putting the long reach
with the left arm,</i>

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:43.378
<i>trying to offload that injured
right shoulder.</i>

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.180
<i>- Ryan also knows
what he's doing.</i>

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:47.215
<i>On every third one,
he's really getting</i>

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.618
<i>a nice little swing
to get him that momentum.</i>

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.287
<i>- And he's looking
for the dismount.</i>

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.655
<i>- Uh-oh, he's stretched out,
Matt.</i>

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:54.756
<i>He's stretched out.</i>

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.458
<i>Look at him
grimacing on his face.</i>

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.859
<i>Fight through it!</i>

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.763
<i>- It's hard to build up
movement for the dismount</i>

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.265
<i>'cause the wheel is rolling,</i>

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.001
<i>but he does it!
Ryan Stratis!</i>

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.168
- Yes!

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.738
Beat that wall!

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.940
<i>- Stratis has done a lot
of runs</i>

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:13.742
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.510
<i>but if he gets up
the Warped Wall,</i>

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:17.479
<i>this may be his greatest ever.</i>

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.648
<i>- Uh-oh, mama.</i>

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.318
<i>- He's got it!</i>

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.453
<i>Just needs to pull himself up.</i>

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:28.757
<i>Is there anything left
in that shoulder?</i>

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:30.992
<i>He can barely hit the buzzer.</i>

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:32.060
<i>What a run!</i>

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:41.369
<i>- I love watching
this man compete.</i>

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:47.008
Ryan Stratis going back to the
city finals where he belongs!

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:52.948
<i>- Look at Ryan Stratis
on Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:56.584
<i>You know that shoulder's
hurting, but look at that face.</i>

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:59.688
<i>That's the face of a guy
who does not quit.</i>

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.756
<i>- Right now he's standing
by with Kristine.</i>

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:05.660
- Ryan, this completion has
to feel better than any other.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:08.296
- Yeah, this has been something
that has been a lot of work.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.333
Coming from a surgery like this
and having all my friends

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:13.735
and fans and everybody
just supporting me

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.870
is just... I'm trying not
to get emotional,

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:17.272
but man, this is...
I love doing this

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.740
for the fans, and this is what
it's all about.

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:20.642
<i>- We saw you were grabbing
your shoulder.</i>

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:21.876
<i>How do you push through?</i>

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:23.311
<i>- I just heard everybody
in the crowd.</i>

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.547
And they just kept chanting and
just kept pushing me forward.

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:27.615
And I didn't want
to let them down.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:29.751
- Well, you mean so much
to this competition.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.186
I really couldn't
be prouder of you.

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:33.221
You did great up there, and we
will see you in the city finals.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:36.358
- Sweet. Thanks.
- Guys, back to you.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.060
<i>- Well, the ladies have been
the story of the night,</i>

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:41.596
<i>but Michelle Warnky
hasn't even run yet.</i>

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:44.366
<i>We could have four women
in the city finals,</i>

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:47.168
<i>but it's gonna come down
to the final runs</i>

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.938
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:57.512
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.280
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:02.117
<i>got their chance
on this Philadelphia course.</i>

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:04.953
<i>Seven-time veteran
Chris Wilczewski dressed</i>

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:07.655
<i>in pink to raise awareness
for breast cancer.</i>

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:10.325
<i>- A huge ambassador
for "Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:13.395
<i>- And though he came up short
at Rolling Thunder,</i>

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.964
<i>it was fast enough
to get him into the finals.</i>

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:16.965
<i>He's moving on.</i>

01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:18.266
- Course is hard.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:20.602
<i>- Jamie Rahn had his
green-haired groupies</i>

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:21.603
<i>out in force.</i>

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:22.704
<i>- Look at Rahn!</i>

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.006
<i>- And Captain NBC used
his superpowers</i>

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:27.742
<i>to get past Rolling Thunder
and hit the buzzer.</i>

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.511
<i>- It ain't a bird.
- It ain't a plane.</i>

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:30.779
<i>It's Jamie Rahn!</i>

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:31.980
- Whoo!

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:34.015
<i>- High school math
teacher Greg Smith</i>

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.451
<i>survived multiple
cancer operations.</i>

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:38.319
<i>Amazing he is here.</i>

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.588
<i>But the man who calls himself
the Scarred Ninja</i>

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.458
<i>still made it
to the third obstacle.</i>

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.294
<i>- And he is not a victim.
- He is a victor.</i>

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:48.863
<i>- And Greg's good friend
Anthony DeFranco</i>

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.799
<i>is up next on the course.</i>

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:52.233
<i>He's a high school track coach</i>

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.002
<i>from Berkeley Heights,
New Jersey.</i>

01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.438
<i>He and Greg were teammates
on the track team.</i>

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.273
<i>When the cancer diagnosis came,</i>

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:00.542
<i>that formed
an unbreakable bond.</i>

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:06.881
- I met Greg through track.
- I was a pole vaulter.

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.951
He was a long jumper.
We became very good friends.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.622
- My junior year,
I was doing great.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.158
I was hitting
all my personal bests.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.060
Then I found a lump one day,
and I was diagnosed

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:22.263
with stage two testicular cancer
at the age of 21.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.331
<i>♪ ♪</i>

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:26.201
<i>I had two major surgeries.</i>

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.169
- Seeing him go through
the worst pain

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:30.805
he's ever been through...
nothing can compare.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:33.408
- It was very difficult to go
from being a top athlete

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.611
<i>and now not be able
to even sit up.</i>

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.279
<i>Going through, like,
all the rounds of chemotherapy,</i>

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:41.216
<i>Anthony was right
by my side the whole way,</i>

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:43.350
<i>trying to, you know,
cheer me up</i>

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:46.888
and keeping me
on my path to beat it.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.491
<i>On January 11, 2013,
my doctors told me</i>

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:52.727
that I was cured
from the cancer.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.662
<i>Well, the next step was
I had to get healthy</i>

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.863
<i>and get back to my life.</i>

01:08:55.866 --> 01:08:59.033
So I'm going left,
right, big pull.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:00.368
- Greg and I began training

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.002
for "American Ninja Warrior"
together,

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:04.037
<i>and I've never seen a fire
in his eye to improve</i>

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.939
<i>and get so much stronger.</i>

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:07.908
It's so much fun
seeing him improve,

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:10.245
us improve together.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:12.080
<i>It's incredible
how far he's come</i>

01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:17.051
and how I'm lucky enough to be
by his side and be his friend.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:18.920
<i>And I'm gonna try to hit
that buzzer for him.</i>

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.991
<i>- And there's Greg.
- He ran just moments ago.</i>

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:24.425
<i>Now gonna cheer on his buddy</i>

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.194
<i>along with Anthony's parents
and girlfriend.</i>

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.198
<i>Anthony DeFranco
was a track star</i>

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.434
<i>at Rider University
in New Jersey.</i>

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.837
<i>Conference champion
in the pole vault.</i>

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.939
<i>- Well, pole vaulters have had
a lot of success on</i>

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:42.944
<i>"American Ninja Warrior,"
and he's not wasting any time.</i>

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:45.246
<i>- Quickly through the Log Grip.</i>

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.916
<i>DeFranco's 5'8", 140.</i>

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:50.984
<i>Now he's through
the Paddle Boards.</i>

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:57.025
<i>- Whoo, the pole vaulter looks
like a sprinter right now.</i>

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.227
<i>He hasn't slowed down yet.</i>

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.933
<i>And the crowd is starting
to notice this rookie's run.</i>

01:10:04.935 --> 01:10:08.203
<i>Now the trampoline.</i>

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.204
<i>Oh!</i>

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:17.245
<i>Well, DeFranco
with the fastest pace</i>

01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:19.480
<i>to this point thus far,
Akbar.</i>

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.916
<i>Put himself in excellent
position to move on.</i>

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:24.752
<i>And this guy's beaten
Captain NBC Jamie Rahn</i>

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.754
<i>in some of these
off-season competitions.</i>

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:28.856
<i>He is the real deal.</i>

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:32.093
<i>His time fast enough to this
point that he's already in.</i>

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.429
<i>But he's got a chance
to beat John Alexis, Jr.</i>

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.930
<i>for the fastest time.</i>

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:37.799
<i>- We've seen the Rolling
Thunder take people out,</i>

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.767
<i>but his aggressive pace
and that... he looks like</i>

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:41.903
<i>he's about to complete
Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:44.405
<i>Boy, DeFranco
is bringing the boom...</i>

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.508
<i>the mighty boom...
here to the Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.878
<i>- And his friend Greg Smith
cheering him on.</i>

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.313
- One more pull!

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:54.349
<i>- What a run by the rookie.</i>

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.584
<i>Now just needs the dismount.</i>

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.688
<i>And he's got it!</i>

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:01.889
<i>Wow, he's racing
for the fastest time!</i>

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:05.193
<i>- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?</i>

01:11:05.195 --> 01:11:07.195
<i>- Are you crazy?
- A rookie!</i>

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.796
- Whoo!

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:16.537
- Fastest time of
the night thus far!

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:19.007
- Whoo!

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.643
<i>- We're gonna make that
tonight's POM Wonderful</i>

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.645
<i>Crazy Healthy run of the night.</i>

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.713
<i>Anthony DeFranco, a rookie,</i>

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.348
<i>just sprinted through
this course</i>

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.349
<i>faster than anyone tonight.</i>

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.350
- Whoo!

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.321
<i>- So with that amazing run,</i>

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:36.724
<i>rookie Anthony DeFranco lands
atop our leaderboard.</i>

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.126
<i>Remember, at the end
of the night,</i>

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:41.996
<i>only the top 30 will advance
to the city finals.</i>

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.931
<i>And it's gonna come down
to the wire</i>

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:45.600
<i>for those three women,</i>

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:47.835
<i>Jesse Labreck,
Rachael Goldstein,</i>

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:51.873
<i>and Allyssa Beird
are at numbers 26, 27, and 28.</i>

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:54.609
<i>If they can stay in the top 30,
they'll make history.</i>

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:58.813
<i>But it's gonna be close.
And look who's coming up next.</i>

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:03.951
<i>It's one of the best ever...
the Weatherman, Joe Moravsky,</i>

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.387
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.894
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:15.797
<i>This season, our friends
at POM Wonderful are offering</i>

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:17.999
<i>a special bonus for the fans.</i>

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.501
<i>Go to NBC.com/POM</i>

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:24.105
<i>to enter the Train Like a Crazy
Healthy Ninja sweepstakes,</i>

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:27.675
<i>where you could win
$10,000 and a trip to L.A.</i>

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.645
<i>to work out with
"American Ninja Warrior" champ</i>

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:33.047
<i>Isaac Caldiero.</i>

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:36.351
<i>- Well, up next, another one of
the ninja greats here</i>

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:37.819
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:40.154
<i>It's the meteorologist
from Sherman, Connecticut...</i>

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:42.156
<i>the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:43.558
<i>And since last year,</i>

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.861
<i>there's been a big change
at the Moravsky house.</i>

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.730
- He's licking your fingers.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.469
Oh, look out, puppy.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.404
My life has changed yet again.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:58.106
<i>Last season, when I was
running the course,</i>

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:00.141
<i>my wife was actually
very pregnant.</i>

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.043
<i>- Joe's about to become a dad.</i>

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.612
<i>His wife Stephanie
expecting their first child</i>

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.080
<i>in a few weeks.</i>

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:08.015
<i>- Had a daughter this
off-season,</i>

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:10.551
and now it's just... it's just
a whole new world for me.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.020
<i>Emily, my daughter...</i>

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:14.655
<i>when she was first born,
I knew it was gonna be hard.</i>

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:17.291
<i>I knew we were gonna be
having very long nights.</i>

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:20.661
I have been so tired so long
that it was very hard

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:23.231
to get back into that mentality

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:26.734
<i>that I really got to start
focusing on working out again.</i>

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.469
- Good.

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:32.974
- "American Ninja Warrior"
used to be a lot about me.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:35.810
<i>- Well, he's done it!
- Joe Moravsky!</i>

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:40.815
- And now, I...

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:46.254
I'm...

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:53.127
<i>Running the course tonight
is about my daughter.</i>

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:55.563
I'm gonna go further than ever.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.133
- Go, Joe!
<i>- And there's little Emily</i>

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.236
<i>watching her first ninja
competition with Mom.</i>

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.540
<i>And there's a big group
of Moravsky fans here.</i>

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:08.910
<i>Three seasons,
he has never failed to hit</i>

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:12.780
<i>a buzzer on a city qualifying
or a city finals course.</i>

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:13.915
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:16.350
<i>That is just amazing
consistency.</i>

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.486
<i>These courses
are so challenging,</i>

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:20.288
<i>but Moravsky finds a way.</i>

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.192
<i>- And already to the third
obstacle... he is flying. Whoo!</i>

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:27.195
<i>- He kept it nice
and tight there.</i>

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:29.230
<i>- Well, he knows if he gets
to the Rolling Thunder</i>

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:32.433
<i>fast enough, it'll guarantee
a spot in the top 30.</i>

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.836
<i>But you know he wants
to finish.</i>

01:14:36.372 --> 01:14:39.173
<i>- Oh, big hop by Moravsky!</i>

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.246
<i>- Oh, and he's hung up though.</i>

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:46.247
<i>- Oh, he's got it.</i>

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:50.952
- There you go!

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.620
<i>- And a wave to Emily.</i>

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:55.022
<i>She's watching Daddy
for the first time.</i>

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:58.159
<i>But now Rolling Thunder.
By making it here so quickly,</i>

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.695
<i>he's already guaranteed a spot
in the city finals.</i>

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:03.564
<i>Look at that reach...
5'10", 165.</i>

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:06.601
<i>- I love the 90 degrees that
he's keeping in his arms here,</i>

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:08.503
<i>controlling
the Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:11.839
- Let's go!
- You got it!

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.442
<i>- And this pace is blistering.</i>

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:17.378
<i>- The forecast looks great
for Joe Morovsky.</i>

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:19.680
<i>- Well, we thought coming in</i>

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.749
<i>he was facing
a high-pressure front,</i>

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:25.553
<i>but Joe Moravsky seems
to respond.</i>

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.589
<i>Looked like a bit of a dead
end there, but he continues.</i>

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:32.226
<i>- Oh my goodness, Joe Moravsky.
- Going for the dismount.</i>

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:36.030
<i>- Are you serious?</i>

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.399
<i>This man would throw lightning
in jail</i>

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.735
<i>and handcuff thunder.</i>

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:43.871
<i>- Joe Moravsky delivers!</i>

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:48.009
<i>This is gonna be one of
the fastest times of the night!</i>

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:51.879
<i>- Your Weatherman moving on
to the city finals once again!</i>

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.781
- Yeah, baby!

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.249
Whoo!

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:58.019
<i>- Delivering in front
of his whole family.</i>

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:01.455
- How is it as a dad?

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:02.957
- It's the greatest feeling,
man.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.992
<i>- Probably every father
can relate</i>

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:08.062
<i>to what Joe Moravsky's feeling
right now.</i>

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.331
<i>- Check out Moravsky
on the Wall Drop.</i>

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:13.134
<i>He gets a nearly perfect
jump to the tubes,</i>

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:16.370
<i>but it took him a few
extra swings on the dismount.</i>

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:20.107
<i>And at the end, a look down
to Daddy's little girl.</i>

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:23.377
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM post-run interview.</i>

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:26.714
- Joe, you have been one of,
if not the, most consistent

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:30.518
ninjas out here, but how has
being a dad changed your life?

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.820
- I was just telling Matt
and Akbar, standing up there,

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:34.755
it's not just about me
or my wife anymore.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:39.527
It's like my...
my own little one... man.

01:16:39.529 --> 01:16:40.928
Holy cow, you got to live it.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.864
You can't... mm.

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:44.899
Yeah.

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:46.300
<i>This is her first ninja event,</i>

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.736
<i>and hopefully it'll be
one of many, many more.</i>

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:51.138
And maybe in the future she'll
be out here doing it too.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.773
- How bad do you want Stage 4?

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.743
- Oh, I want Stage 3 first,
and then Stage 4.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.712
- All right, well,
you are one button down, Joe.

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.747
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:01.248
- Guys, back to you.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.119
<i>- And now, those three women
are sitting in 27th, 28th,</i>

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.989
<i>and 29th,
with four runners to go.</i>

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.957
<i>Can they stay in the top 30?</i>

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.226
<i>And can Michelle Warnky
join them?</i>

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:15.529
<i>It could be an historic
finish in Philly</i>

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:18.666
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:24.138
<i>- Welcome back
to Philadelphia qualifying.</i>

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.241
<i>And we've had big drama
in the last few minutes,</i>

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:30.411
<i>as the fate of three female
competitors was decided</i>

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.313
<i>by the final runs of the night.</i>

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:35.549
<i>First, college student
Sami Newton got her shot.</i>

01:17:35.551 --> 01:17:38.686
- Come on, Sami!
<i>- But went out on the Log Grip.</i>

01:17:38.688 --> 01:17:40.254
<i>Oh!</i>

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:42.456
<i>That fall guaranteed
Jesse Labreck</i>

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:44.492
<i>a spot in the top 30.</i>

01:17:44.494 --> 01:17:45.826
<i>Fore!</i>

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.995
<i>Then New Jersey
golf club salesman</i>

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.032
<i>Brian Keane also went out
on the Log Grip.</i>

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:54.068
<i>And the water hazard
for Brian Keane.</i>

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.936
<i>And that meant
Rachel Goldstein</i>

01:17:55.938 --> 01:17:58.439
<i>also made it
to the city finals.</i>

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:00.408
<i>Finally,
it was Abel Gonzalez,</i>

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:03.711
<i>who made it to Stage 3
in Vegas last year.</i>

01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:05.146
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:07.381
<i>- But in one of the biggest
shocks of the night,</i>

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:09.617
<i>he was eliminated
at the third obstacle</i>

01:18:09.619 --> 01:18:11.419
<i>when he stepped
on the middle beam.</i>

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:14.689
<i>- And everyone is
in complete shock.</i>

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.857
<i>- That surprise ending
secured a spot</i>

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.426
<i>for teacher Allyssa Beird,</i>

01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:20.594
<i>meaning three women
are in the top 30</i>

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:22.563
<i>for the first time ever.</i>

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.498
<i>But the women aren't done.</i>

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.401
<i>We could have a fourth,
because one of the athletes</i>

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:30.938
<i>congratulating the others
minutes ago now gets her shot.</i>

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.840
<i>It's Michelle Warnky.</i>

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.442
<i>The Ohio gym owner has been</i>

01:18:34.444 --> 01:18:37.178
<i>a trailblazer
on the course and off.</i>

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.847
- Welcome to Movement Lab Ohio.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:42.149
Starting down
the gym-owner path

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.652
has been quite an experience.

01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:47.121
<i>- The past year has really been
a transitional phase</i>

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:48.656
for Michelle,
because in the past,

01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:51.859
she really has been focused
solely on her athletics.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.628
<i>Now she's a businesswoman.</i>

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:56.197
- Whoo-hoo!

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.799
A lot of people, I think,
assume because I'm a gym owner

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.368
that I'm just training
ninja stuff all the time.

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.370
<i>And for me, any time
I walk in the gym,</i>

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.039
<i>all I see is my to-do list.</i>

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:07.108
Hi, welcome to the Movement Lab.
This is Michelle.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:09.543
So it's really hard for me
to put that aside

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.011
and still try to train myself.

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:12.012
- You're good to go.
- All right.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:13.114
- Have fun.

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:15.282
<i>But then, over
the last few months,</i>

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:17.184
<i>in preparation for this season,</i>

01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:18.719
<i>I've learned to manage
my time better,</i>

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:20.988
<i>and I have no doubt I'm ready
for a good run tonight.</i>

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:25.559
<i>- Michelle has her whole
family here,</i>

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:26.927
<i>including her dad Chris,</i>

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.864
<i>one of the loudest ninja fans
in the country.</i>

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:32.600
<i>And speaking of girl power,
Jessie Graff is here.</i>

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:35.903
<i>We'll see Jessie in two weeks
in the L.A. city finals.</i>

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.872
<i>Michelle needs to get
to Rolling Thunder</i>

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:39.206
<i>in less than two minutes,</i>

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:41.375
<i>and she'll be a part of
history.</i>

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:44.478
<i>- Well, this is her fourth year
in "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.081
<i>One of the most storied
female competitors,</i>

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.950
<i>the second woman ever to get up
that Warped Wall,</i>

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:52.286
<i>just after Kacy Catanzaro.</i>

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:55.289
<i>- Oh, a little hung up.
- Uh-oh. Stay strong here.</i>

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.459
<i>- Good confidence there out
of the veteran Warnky.</i>

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:02.029
<i>Three times she's been
to Vegas... so strong.</i>

01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:03.430
<i>Having a little trouble</i>

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:04.965
<i>finding a comfortable
grip hold, though, Akbar.</i>

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.700
<i>- Oh, she's holding on,
though, Matt.</i>

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:09.937
<i>- But you know
she has fists of steel.</i>

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.507
- You got it, Michelle!
- You got it!

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:18.245
<i>- Michelle Warnky looking to
cap a huge night for the women.</i>

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:19.513
<i>- Oh, yeah!</i>

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:23.717
<i>- Michelle Warnky...
great agility there.</i>

01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:24.985
<i>- She's got a little over</i>

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.720
<i>a minute left
to get to Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:29.056
<i>But now the Wall Drop.</i>

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:32.126
<i>- And Matt, Michelle has
tremendous upper-body strength,</i>

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:35.396
<i>but she's had trouble
in the past with trampolines.</i>

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:38.465
<i>- And this may be
the big test right here.</i>

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.238
<i>Oh, she's got it!</i>

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.207
<i>But struggling a little bit.</i>

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:47.875
<i>- Come on, Warnky.</i>

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:53.781
<i>- Just needs to complete this
obstacle and she is in.</i>

01:20:53.783 --> 01:20:55.816
<i>- Now she's got it.
- Yes!</i>

01:20:55.818 --> 01:20:57.084
<i>- Warnky's moving on!</i>

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.819
- Whoo!

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:00.888
Yes, yes, yes!

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:03.057
<i>- Michelle Warnky has done it!</i>

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.692
<i>She's now part of history,</i>

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:06.760
<i>becoming the fourth woman
tonight</i>

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:09.597
<i>advancing to a city finals
round.</i>

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:16.537
<i>How much further can she go?</i>

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:18.939
<i>Listen to that scream!</i>

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:20.674
<i>- Well, she knows she's in,</i>

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:23.544
<i>but Warnky told us
she wants to hit that buzzer.</i>

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:24.712
<i>This will be a test.</i>

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:27.648
<i>At 135 pounds,
she's just a few pounds</i>

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.316
<i>more than this apparatus.</i>

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:30.985
<i>Oh, she's having
to fight to move it,</i>

01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:32.686
<i>and again, it looks like
a wheel,</i>

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.722
<i>but those spokes,
the way they're spaced,</i>

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.925
<i>it locks in every rotation.
You have to force it.</i>

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.293
<i>- She's putting in work.</i>

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:41.495
<i>She doesn't need to punch
in her timecard.</i>

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:43.497
<i>You know she's working
and getting busy.</i>

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.066
<i>- But there it is,
that spoke that's blocked</i>

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.702
<i>with the Plexiglas wall.</i>

01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:51.071
<i>- And she... oh!
- Oh, grab up there, girl!</i>

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.306
<i>Muscle up!</i>

01:21:52.308 --> 01:21:54.808
<i>- I love watching
this woman compete.</i>

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:56.343
<i>- With a smile on her face.</i>

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:58.345
<i>- Well, this crowd
on their feet,</i>

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:01.181
<i>showing their appreciation
for what Warnky</i>

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:03.684
<i>and these other women
have done tonight.</i>

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.386
<i>- I think this may be it
though.</i>

01:22:05.388 --> 01:22:07.588
Oh!

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:12.426
<i>- Well, she didn't finish
the course,</i>

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.062
<i>but she helped
make history tonight</i>

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:18.465
<i>as one of four women
moving on to the city finals.</i>

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:21.135
<i>- Well, Michelle Warnky's had
trouble with trampolines</i>

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:23.103
<i>in the past, but not tonight.</i>

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.874
<i>She gets big air and then
fought her way to the pad.</i>

01:22:26.876 --> 01:22:29.043
<i>Her time got her in the top 30.</i>

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:30.945
<i>Now she's part of history.</i>

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:34.014
<i>- And right now, Kristine's
with the fantastic four.</i>

01:22:34.016 --> 01:22:35.182
- Michelle, you've been part

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:36.650
of this competition
for so long.

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:38.886
You're really a staple
of "American Ninja Warrior."

01:22:38.888 --> 01:22:41.989
Tell me what this means for
the sport, to have this happen.

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:43.557
- Yeah, this is awesome.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:46.694
Before this happened,
the competition, we were like,

01:22:46.696 --> 01:22:47.928
"You know,
I think we can get, like,

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:49.930
four or five ladies
hitting that buzzer."

01:22:49.932 --> 01:22:51.231
So we didn't quite hit
the buzzer,

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:54.568
<i>but we made some extra air,
which is awesome.</i>

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:57.771
- I am so proud of four ladies
making it to the city finals.

01:22:57.773 --> 01:22:59.406
Good luck,
and we will see you then.

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:00.474
Matt and Akbar, back to you.

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:05.446
<i>- So our leaderboard ends up
with rookie Anthony DeFranco</i>

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:07.214
<i>having the fastest time,</i>

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:10.117
<i>with Philly's own Najee
Richardson in the five spot.</i>

01:23:10.119 --> 01:23:12.152
<i>Other finishers
include Geoff Britten,</i>

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.755
<i>who was seventh among
the night's nine finishers.</i>

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:16.924
<i>The rest of the field
is filled by those</i>

01:23:16.926 --> 01:23:18.492
<i>who made it to Rolling Thunder,</i>

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.761
<i>which was a ninja killer
tonight.</i>

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.496
<i>The top female,
Michelle Warnky,</i>

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.598
<i>landed in the 17th spot.</i>

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.266
<i>All of these athletes
will be back</i>

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:28.602
<i>in a few weeks
for the city finals.</i>

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:31.071
<i>And that includes
the three female rookies</i>

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:33.707
<i>who grabbed the final
three spots.</i>

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.710
<i>And there they are,
the fantastic four</i>

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:38.645
<i>who made history tonight.</i>

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:41.015
<i>Next time, we'll see
another top female,</i>

01:23:41.017 --> 01:23:45.085
<i>Jessie Graff, plus
Kevin Bull and Flip Rodriguez,</i>

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:47.755
<i>as the intensity reaches
a whole new level.</i>

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:50.758
<i>It's the first of our
city finals competitions,</i>

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.659
<i>starting in Los Angeles.</i>

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:54.695
For Akbar Gbajabiamila
and Kristine Leahy,

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.030
I'm Matt Iseman,

01:23:56.032 --> 01:24:00.968
and we'll see you next time
on "American Ninja Warrior."
