00:42.710 --> 00:46.059
<i>Long ago, when the pyramids
were still young, -</i>

00:46.294 --> 00:50.418
<i>- Egyptian kings played a game
of great and terrible power.</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:55.154
<i>They did battle with magic and
monsters for riches and glory.</i>

00:55.318 --> 00:58.100
<i>From these Shadow Games
erupted a war -</i>

00:58.263 --> 01:00.532
<i>- that threatened to
destroy the world, -</i>

01:00.694 --> 01:04.971
<i>- until a brave and powerful pharaoh
locked the dark magic away, -</i>

01:05.174 --> 01:10.412
<i>- imprisoning it for all eternity within
the mystical Millennium Items.</i>

01:10.646 --> 01:14.575
<i>But even eternity
doesn't last forever.</i>

01:19.447 --> 01:24.084
<i>It was never to happen, and
for 5000 years it never did.</i>

01:24.247 --> 01:28.240
<i>The secret of the Millennium Puzzle
remain safely beyond reach.</i>

01:28.407 --> 01:33.044
<i>Within the imponderable conundrum
of it's intricate design.</i>

01:34.199 --> 01:37.395
<i>For a boy named Yugi, the mystery
of the Millennium Puzzle -</i>

01:37.559 --> 01:38.803
<i>- remains just that.</i>

01:38.999 --> 01:44.814
<i>The solution, if one exists, eludes him
as it did those that came before him.</i>

01:45.015 --> 01:48.310
<i>But this time, fate has played
a hand in bringing the puzzle -</i>

01:48.503 --> 01:51.536
<i>- and this person together.</i>

01:56.695 --> 01:58.386
<i>It was never to happen.</i>

01:58.583 --> 02:01.879
<i>And for 5000 years it never did.</i>

02:02.039 --> 02:04.624
<i>But while the desert
does it's best to conceal -</i>

02:04.791 --> 02:06.930
<i>- that which should
remain burried, -</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:11.732
<i>- it eventually yielded it's most
ancient and terrible secrets.</i>

02:16.695 --> 02:20.176
We found it. The lost
tomb of Anubis.

02:34.872 --> 02:38.168
Professor, what do you
make of this? It's amazing.

02:38.424 --> 02:41.937
What possessed them to put
the sarcophagus in chains?

02:44.504 --> 02:45.846
Hey, all right!

02:47.288 --> 02:50.135
Maybe this one next.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.741
Yeah! One to go.

02:53.975 --> 02:57.172
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.984
Now what have we here?

03:13.368 --> 03:15.703
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised
when he sees I've figured -

03:15.864 --> 03:17.686
- this puzzle out all by myself.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.790
The last piece.

03:21.657 --> 03:23.664
This is it.

03:35.321 --> 03:40.176
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.

03:54.745 --> 03:56.720
What's going on?

04:03.033 --> 04:06.677
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.361
This tomb is cursed.

04:23.065 --> 04:25.432
Hey! What is this?

04:49.562 --> 04:52.628
Yu-Gi-Oh!

05:03.546 --> 05:07.440
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!

05:07.673 --> 05:10.357
Return to the dark realm
from whence you came!

05:19.962 --> 05:24.271
<i>It was never to happen but
after 5000 years it did.</i>

05:24.474 --> 05:28.697
<i>And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.</i>

05:51.226 --> 05:54.521
<i>In the three short years since
he started playing Duel Monsters -</i>

05:54.747 --> 05:57.430
<i>- Yugi Moto has risen to
international stardom, -</i>

05:57.627 --> 06:01.239
<i>- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.</i>

06:01.434 --> 06:04.566
<i>But what makes this young
man such a talented duelist?</i>

06:04.565 --> 06:07.795
<i>Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -</i>

06:07.995 --> 06:10.646
<i>- powerful God Cards he's
assembled in his deck?</i>

06:10.875 --> 06:15.152
<i>Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven
his dueling powers time and again.</i>

06:15.355 --> 06:18.551
<i>He has reigned victorious in the
most prestigious tournaments, -</i>

06:18.714 --> 06:21.202
<i>- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.</i>

06:21.467 --> 06:24.434
<i>And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -</i>

06:24.667 --> 06:27.831
<i>- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.</i>

06:28.026 --> 06:30.035
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -

06:30.235 --> 06:32.145
- around this little high
school pipsqueak.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.347
<i>Yugi says his success is due
to his grandfather's coaching -</i>

06:35.516 --> 06:37.785
<i>- and to his belief in the
heart of the cards.</i>

06:37.979 --> 06:41.624
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.

06:42.107 --> 06:44.496
<i>But other say it is the
three Egyptian God Cards -</i>

06:44.699 --> 06:46.936
<i>- that make Yugi
virtually unbeatable.</i>

06:47.100 --> 06:51.290
<i>And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -</i>

06:51.451 --> 06:54.767
<i>- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?</i>

06:55.580 --> 06:58.329
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?

06:59.003 --> 07:00.313
You've got one.

07:00.476 --> 07:04.120
And this time things are gonna end
differently, you pompous windbag.

07:08.091 --> 07:10.939
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -

07:11.132 --> 07:13.433
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.

07:13.660 --> 07:17.554
Make all the smug pronouncements
you like, but know this:

07:17.724 --> 07:20.441
There's got to be a way
to beat your God Cards.

07:20.604 --> 07:22.546
And I won't stop until I find it.

07:23.836 --> 07:26.225
Now I activate the Magic Card -

07:26.460 --> 07:29.078
- Polymerization.

07:30.107 --> 07:32.858
This allows me to fuse my
three dragons together, -

07:33.021 --> 07:35.867
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

07:38.140 --> 07:40.082
And that's just for starters.

07:41.596 --> 07:45.622
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles
my dragon's attack points:

07:45.788 --> 07:48.276
Megamorph.

07:50.876 --> 07:54.446
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful
than any monster on the field.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.307
There is more to power
than just attack points.

07:58.141 --> 08:00.312
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

08:00.509 --> 08:04.851
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess
powers far beyond meer monsters.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.801
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -

08:07.964 --> 08:12.307
- I can bestow upon the
third, infinite strength.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.924
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.

08:21.916 --> 08:27.350
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is
the strongest monster in play.

08:28.701 --> 08:32.660
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.

08:33.660 --> 08:39.259
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him
what true power is all about.

08:41.116 --> 08:45.012
Attack with Fist of Fury!

08:55.038 --> 08:56.631
No.

08:59.357 --> 09:01.430
My dragon.

09:04.509 --> 09:07.924
<i>- No!
- System overload!</i>

09:08.189 --> 09:11.004
The simulation is malfunctioning.

09:12.766 --> 09:15.864
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was
certain that our calculations -

09:16.029 --> 09:18.200
- were correct this time, sir.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.662
If you just give us one
more chance, sir.

09:20.925 --> 09:23.314
So you can fail again? Sorry.

09:23.517 --> 09:26.813
Please, sir. We're close to
postulating a winning strategem.

09:27.678 --> 09:31.060
Well if I were you I'd start
postulating myself a new job.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.233
You've had more than enough
time to find a way to beat -

09:34.429 --> 09:38.805
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But
as usual I have to do it myself.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.405
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.

09:43.006 --> 09:45.973
<i>There's gotta be some way
to defeat Yugi's God Cards.</i>

09:46.174 --> 09:48.541
<i>And I think I know
were to start looking.</i>

10:33.182 --> 10:35.571
The God Cards?

10:59.583 --> 11:01.689
What a horrible nightmare.

11:03.871 --> 11:08.574
That's it, no more white wine
spritzers before bedtime for me.

11:13.055 --> 11:16.535
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.

11:16.768 --> 11:19.670
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -

11:19.903 --> 11:24.659
- but I can still see that something
terrible is about to unfold.

11:31.775 --> 11:35.419
About time the museum got a descent
display of Egyptian artifacts.

11:36.703 --> 11:39.737
Hey, that looks just like
a Millennium Item.

11:40.735 --> 11:42.939
This I gotta see.

11:52.832 --> 11:54.109
<i>This is flight command.</i>

11:54.272 --> 11:56.661
<i>Initiating Duel Dome
launch convertion. Over.</i>

11:56.864 --> 11:59.101
<i>Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -</i>

11:59.264 --> 12:01.151
<i>- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.</i>

12:01.472 --> 12:05.334
<i>We show Mr. Kaiba now
approaching primary flight deck.</i>

12:11.104 --> 12:13.176
Begin complete
systems check at once.

12:13.664 --> 12:15.551
<i>- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.</i>

12:15.776 --> 12:17.369
<i>- Navigation sensors.
- Check.</i>

12:17.632 --> 12:22.105
<i>- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.</i>

12:28.672 --> 12:31.541
<i>Blue-Eyes White Jet,
you are clear for take-off.</i>

12:31.776 --> 12:34.427
Activating main thrust rockets.

12:39.392 --> 12:43.385
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.</i>

13:40.929 --> 13:42.455
Red wine spritzer, sir.

13:47.809 --> 13:51.421
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.

13:51.682 --> 13:53.275
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.

13:53.505 --> 13:57.117
You and I have never been friends,
so let's not start pretending that we are.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.681
Oh, my. Sounds like
someone's need a hug.

13:59.873 --> 14:03.354
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it,
there is something I need.

14:03.554 --> 14:06.172
Listen. I've come to your
little fantasy island -

14:06.173 --> 14:09.921
- in search of a card powerful enough
to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.

14:09.922 --> 14:14.363
And you believe I'd might have this
all-powerful God-smiting Card because?

14:14.881 --> 14:17.151
Because you created
the game, Pegasus.

14:17.346 --> 14:20.729
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy,
but I'm retired now.

14:20.962 --> 14:25.473
The only things I create these days are
places like this for the fishies to enjoy.

14:25.474 --> 14:27.962
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -

14:28.194 --> 14:31.293
- and would have never let them
out of your sweaty little hands, -

14:31.457 --> 14:34.010
- unless you also created
a way to beat them.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.795
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess.

14:36.994 --> 14:40.027
I may have one card that could
help, but you can't have it.

14:40.226 --> 14:43.161
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -

14:43.329 --> 14:45.501
- but I don't think you deserve it.

14:45.666 --> 14:48.666
True I may not see
as well as I once did.

14:48.866 --> 14:51.354
But to be honest, it
doesn't take a magic eye -

14:51.522 --> 14:55.232
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has
trounced your sorry behind again and again.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.215
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.

14:57.443 --> 15:00.639
Well since I'm such a disappointment,
you should have no trouble -

15:00.803 --> 15:03.934
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?

15:04.323 --> 15:08.349
Because if you'll put up the card I
need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.

15:08.579 --> 15:11.426
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -

15:11.587 --> 15:13.953
- just for a chance to
trounce little Yugi?

15:14.146 --> 15:17.594
My, my, my, seems you're even
more desperate than I thought.

15:18.915 --> 15:21.282
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.

15:22.178 --> 15:27.164
Kaiba, my dear and devious
friend, let the games begin.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.857
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.

15:30.947 --> 15:32.834
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.

15:33.027 --> 15:35.776
But I haven't seen this many people
running from school since they served -

15:35.939 --> 15:38.557
- meat loaf surprise last year.

15:38.883 --> 15:41.436
- What in the...
- Let me see.

15:41.634 --> 15:44.504
Wonder who these guys
are all waiting for.

15:44.707 --> 15:46.430
It's him.

15:46.627 --> 15:49.442
Told you he's alot
smaller than on tv.

15:49.635 --> 15:51.228
Me first. Let me at him.

15:51.427 --> 15:54.045
Please just give me one
shot at those God Cards.

15:54.211 --> 15:57.114
Get out of my way! If anyone
gets the God Cards, it's me.

15:57.380 --> 16:00.446
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?

16:00.643 --> 16:04.353
Life on the top, Téa. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.

16:04.516 --> 16:06.883
So they all want a piece of
him, and those God Cards.

16:07.107 --> 16:10.141
Téa, try to sneak Yugi around the
back, while we hold them off.

16:10.308 --> 16:13.155
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.992
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.

16:20.868 --> 16:23.257
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.

16:23.427 --> 16:25.794
- On three.
- Quick, after them.

16:25.988 --> 16:28.705
Forget about those nobodies.

16:29.187 --> 16:31.326
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.377
I said you're nobody.

16:33.539 --> 16:35.906
Yeah, that's right. And
everybody knows it too.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.173
Well just everybody
who's anybody, that is.

16:38.404 --> 16:41.121
Listen up. Nobody but
nobody calls me a nobody, -

16:41.284 --> 16:45.277
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.

16:45.444 --> 16:47.331
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -

16:47.523 --> 16:50.371
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.

16:50.596 --> 16:53.279
The Master of the Gods, not
the Master of the Clods.

16:53.476 --> 16:56.323
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -

16:56.515 --> 16:59.199
- by doing top-contender,
and I think I know one.

16:59.363 --> 17:01.437
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.

17:01.636 --> 17:03.742
So if you wanna get
to the King of Games -

17:03.940 --> 17:09.155
- you'll have to go through me,
the Godfather of Games, capiche.

17:18.277 --> 17:20.960
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.546
Won't take long. Let's do this.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.984
Okay, ladies first.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.212
Funny. Take this!

17:29.476 --> 17:33.186
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.139
Hi, there.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.726
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.

17:41.892 --> 17:43.452
Say ah!

17:44.260 --> 17:46.082
What the...

17:52.068 --> 17:56.509
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in
order to summon Maju Garzett.

18:00.228 --> 18:02.683
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.

18:09.221 --> 18:13.793
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you
to say it, not spray it? Some menace.

18:13.989 --> 18:16.356
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.

18:16.549 --> 18:20.259
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -

18:20.486 --> 18:23.104
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.

18:23.333 --> 18:27.108
Which means all the monsters you got
out on the field are destroyed, pal.

18:27.302 --> 18:29.244
Lightning Sword.

18:35.749 --> 18:37.276
Ah, nuts!

18:39.813 --> 18:42.596
Maybe now, you'll have the
proper respect for Joey -

18:42.758 --> 18:44.732
- the Godfather of Games.

18:44.997 --> 18:46.590
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?

18:46.789 --> 18:49.245
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.

18:49.445 --> 18:52.096
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.683
We're gonna get ya.

18:58.597 --> 19:02.656
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.

19:05.413 --> 19:07.683
Quick! Yugi, this way.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.828
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.

19:13.991 --> 19:16.925
Some place where we will be save
from that Duel Monsters mob.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.913
Some place they'd never look.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.346
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?

19:21.510 --> 19:24.991
Is this the latest in duel arena
technology, or what?

19:25.159 --> 19:26.981
This place is an outdated joke.

19:27.206 --> 19:29.824
But then so are you,
so I suppose it fits.

19:30.086 --> 19:34.309
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get
nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.

19:35.046 --> 19:37.468
Look, enough small talk.

19:38.247 --> 19:39.523
Let's duel!

19:39.686 --> 19:41.475
I'll start things off.

19:42.854 --> 19:46.913
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to
enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.

19:47.110 --> 19:50.426
A world of chaos. A world
of absolute mayhem.

19:51.238 --> 19:55.394
That's right. A world of Toons.

19:59.111 --> 20:03.715
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually
still using that idiotic Toon World card.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.074
Well, this is gonna be even
easier than I thought.

20:07.910 --> 20:11.260
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.

20:18.183 --> 20:19.841
And this for later.

20:20.071 --> 20:22.144
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.

20:27.431 --> 20:29.635
I summon X-Head Cannon.

20:32.712 --> 20:35.559
I'll throw two cards face down.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.411
For later.

20:37.639 --> 20:40.803
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.

20:40.967 --> 20:43.301
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?

20:43.623 --> 20:46.820
No wait that I now play this.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.446
Card of Sanctity.

20:51.015 --> 20:53.568
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us
each to draw until we both -

20:53.767 --> 20:56.255
- have six cards in our hand.

20:58.183 --> 21:02.590
<i>Just what I needed. And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.</i>

21:02.759 --> 21:05.280
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?

21:05.511 --> 21:08.772
I know what it means. Now you can summon
your strongest monsters to the field -

21:08.967 --> 21:10.374
- more easily.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.673
Please, what do you take me
for, some kind of a rookie?

21:12.904 --> 21:15.621
You're not quite that
good, Kaiba-boy.

21:15.784 --> 21:18.467
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.

21:20.168 --> 21:22.372
But I won't be using her just yet.

21:22.537 --> 21:25.832
First I'll attack with
the Gemini Elves.

21:26.344 --> 21:28.832
And I think I'll have
them target... -

21:31.560 --> 21:32.967
- you.

21:35.272 --> 21:37.443
Cartoons are so violent
these days.

21:37.608 --> 21:40.641
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.

21:40.872 --> 21:45.924
When they deal damage to a player,
that player loses a card from his hand.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.692
Aren't my Toons simply
magnificent, Kaiba-boy?

21:52.232 --> 21:53.661
Oh, don't look so sour.

21:53.896 --> 21:58.151
Think of it this way, at least it will be them
stopping you little quest to the top and not -

21:58.312 --> 22:00.384
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.

22:00.584 --> 22:06.334
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.461
I guess it's true that when you get old,
the mind is the first thing to go, because -

22:11.624 --> 22:13.991
- you forgot all about
my face down cards.

22:14.184 --> 22:16.640
And now it's gonna cost you.

22:19.561 --> 22:20.968
Attack Guidance Armor.

22:21.161 --> 22:25.122
This trap's like a magnet that redirects
your own attack right back at you.

22:25.353 --> 22:27.240
No, you wouldn't.

22:27.529 --> 22:29.438
Oh, yes I would. And I will.

22:29.673 --> 22:34.627
Guidance Armor, attach to
the Toon Gemini Elves.

22:55.145 --> 22:57.796
But they were just innocent Toons.

22:58.025 --> 23:00.098
You'll pay for that.

23:00.361 --> 23:05.150
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.640
And play Ultimate Offering.

23:09.897 --> 23:14.502
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.

23:14.665 --> 23:18.081
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -

23:18.282 --> 23:21.381
- this first monster will be
quite a powerful one.

23:21.546 --> 23:25.091
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.

23:28.362 --> 23:30.118
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?

23:30.314 --> 23:34.209
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile.

23:34.410 --> 23:37.160
Well, compared to
the next Toon, that is.

23:37.354 --> 23:41.925
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.

23:43.561 --> 23:46.561
Sure, I'll have to give up
another 500 of my life ponts, -

23:46.762 --> 23:48.769
- but then, you know what
they say, Kaiba-boy:

23:49.002 --> 23:53.192
You have to spend life
points to take life points.

23:53.354 --> 23:55.209
Of course, you know all about that.

23:55.370 --> 23:59.167
Yugi's been taking your life points
for what, going on three years now?

23:59.402 --> 24:02.631
Oh, I'm sorry to keep
bringing that up.

24:03.818 --> 24:07.201
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.

24:07.626 --> 24:09.862
Now by discarding one
card from my hand, -

24:10.058 --> 24:12.294
- I can remove any
monster from the game.

24:12.682 --> 24:13.958
I see.

24:14.122 --> 24:16.610
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -

24:16.809 --> 24:18.817
- but I guess this is goodbye.

24:19.050 --> 24:22.215
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't
be getting off that easily, -

24:22.379 --> 24:25.445
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
Head from my hand.

24:25.643 --> 24:28.840
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.

24:29.515 --> 24:32.068
What? But X-Head Cannon
is your own monster.

24:32.266 --> 24:33.641
What are you scheming?

24:33.834 --> 24:36.387
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.

24:36.587 --> 24:38.954
It removes one more
monster from the game -

24:39.115 --> 24:41.155
- and I'm using it on
my Y-Dragon Head.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.494
Why are you removing
your own monsters?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.894
And now, I summon -

24:46.059 --> 24:48.645
- Z-Metal Tank.

24:50.283 --> 24:52.170
That makes no sense, unless...

24:52.811 --> 24:56.324
Unless I still have one
more card to play, Pegasus.

24:56.522 --> 24:58.148
And it so happens I do.

24:58.411 --> 25:01.061
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.

25:01.322 --> 25:04.705
It's well worth half my life points
to bring back all my monsters.

25:04.906 --> 25:09.129
And nice trick to know when you wanna
summon more than one monster in a turn.

25:10.091 --> 25:14.401
And as you're well aware, these aren't
just any monsters, Pegasus.

25:14.635 --> 25:16.839
They combine.

25:23.243 --> 25:27.881
Together they create the
ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.

25:29.996 --> 25:35.014
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need
to blast any card I want out of the duel.

25:35.308 --> 25:38.952
If you still say you're gonna win,
then it's time to change your tune.

25:39.148 --> 25:42.312
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!

25:42.572 --> 25:45.321
Use Cannon Firestorm.

25:57.996 --> 26:00.200
That's all folks.

26:00.395 --> 26:03.843
Now let's see which you've
got to beat the Egyptian Gods.

26:04.908 --> 26:07.428
Looks like you had two
cards up your sleeve.

26:08.012 --> 26:10.379
What do you mean, two cards?

26:11.211 --> 26:14.179
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.034
Nice try, you snake.

26:21.036 --> 26:24.811
The museum is the last place those
demented duelists would think to look for you.

26:24.972 --> 26:26.379
Hope you're right.

26:26.571 --> 26:30.053
Hey, it's some kind of
an Egyptian exhibit.

26:31.533 --> 26:32.842
Look, Téa.

26:33.036 --> 26:35.273
That blue pyramid, there.

26:35.660 --> 26:39.173
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.

26:39.373 --> 26:41.161
Let's go check it out.

26:48.333 --> 26:52.556
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

26:52.717 --> 26:55.783
If we stay here I'm
gonna blow chunks.

26:56.268 --> 26:59.584
Okay, I get the point, Téa.
You're not a mummy fan.

27:08.333 --> 27:11.628
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?

27:11.821 --> 27:14.188
Oh, well it looks like great
minds think alike.

27:14.797 --> 27:17.699
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.

27:17.933 --> 27:20.300
This says, it's called
the Pyramid of Light.

27:20.524 --> 27:24.997
In all my years of egyptology, I've
never come across this relic before.

27:25.197 --> 27:29.953
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror
who tried to bring about the end of the world.

27:30.222 --> 27:33.255
Well I guess it's pretty safe to
say his plan didn't work, right?

27:33.454 --> 27:35.690
Legends say a brave pharaoh
destroyed him using -

27:35.853 --> 27:38.242
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.

27:38.477 --> 27:43.049
The same pharaoh who many believed
possessed your Millennium Puzzle.

27:43.277 --> 27:45.001
Come, I'll show you.

27:45.805 --> 27:47.715
See? There is the knife.

27:47.950 --> 27:51.179
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.

27:51.342 --> 27:53.797
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.

27:53.966 --> 27:58.919
"The eye that sees what's yet to
come its vision shall be fulfilled -"

27:59.118 --> 28:01.703
"- unless blinded by events
predetermined."

28:01.934 --> 28:04.137
"Thus light and shadows
both be killed."

28:27.021 --> 28:28.876
From the light comes the dark.

28:31.821 --> 28:34.604
Téa? Would you read me the
story about the bunny?

28:34.766 --> 28:37.614
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion
talking and forget all about it.

28:37.775 --> 28:39.236
'Cause right now we
got bigger problems.

28:39.502 --> 28:41.673
Like where King Tut's
freaky cousin went.

28:41.902 --> 28:44.291
The mummy's body's been stolen.

28:45.006 --> 28:48.322
And that's not all. He napped
that pyramid thing too.

28:48.558 --> 28:50.446
Grandpa. Stay here.

28:50.638 --> 28:53.486
I have a feeling Kaiba's in
danger. I have to warn him.

28:53.679 --> 28:56.045
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.

28:56.238 --> 28:57.515
I'll call you.

28:58.318 --> 28:59.693
What hit me?

28:59.855 --> 29:01.960
Probably whatever
broke into the museum.

29:02.190 --> 29:03.619
No. This is terrible.

29:03.822 --> 29:06.790
Yeah, they took the mummy
and the Pyramid of Light.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.543
This is one crime those
crooks is gonna regret.

29:09.742 --> 29:14.379
According to the legend, Anubis found
that he would one day return from the dead.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.331
What's going on?

29:16.494 --> 29:20.488
- You don't really think that...
- Téa, I don't know what to think.

29:20.719 --> 29:24.134
Let's just hope that
legend is just a legend.

29:26.927 --> 29:28.333
Stop the car!

29:32.718 --> 29:36.232
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.694
And he says that it's real important
that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.

29:40.303 --> 29:43.303
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.

29:43.471 --> 29:46.766
All I know is that Seto hasn't
been acting like himself lately.

29:46.992 --> 29:48.552
I think he's gonna
totally lose it.

29:50.607 --> 29:52.429
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.

29:52.623 --> 29:56.038
Or, like you helped. Then again
you duel worse than my mom.

29:56.271 --> 29:59.588
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.

30:00.271 --> 30:03.435
Check it out. What's Kaiba's
limo doing at Yugi's place?

30:05.071 --> 30:07.373
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!

30:09.039 --> 30:12.585
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.

30:24.815 --> 30:27.663
My brother's waiting
for you on the top floor.

30:27.887 --> 30:29.774
I got it. Thanks.

30:36.943 --> 30:39.846
<i>Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.</i>

30:41.072 --> 30:44.749
<i>Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.</i>

30:48.240 --> 30:50.509
This is want he wants.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.862
But it is too much of a coincident
that Kaiba would send for us -

30:55.057 --> 30:58.766
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.091
And I'm pretty sure it has something
to do with that Anubis guy.

31:02.256 --> 31:05.802
It seams like you had some kind of
battle with him 5000 years ago.

31:06.352 --> 31:10.411
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my
days as the pharaoh are clouded, -

31:10.576 --> 31:15.180
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.

31:15.376 --> 31:17.896
I sure wish we knew more about
what happened back in your past.

31:18.128 --> 31:20.649
All that matters is that we
face the future together.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.847
And I wouldn't have it any other
way. Are you ready partner?

31:24.016 --> 31:25.477
Ready.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.615
Yu-Gi-Oh!

31:33.105 --> 31:35.560
Kaiba's car is outside
so Yugi must be here.

31:35.792 --> 31:39.567
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?

31:39.792 --> 31:42.760
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?

31:42.961 --> 31:45.514
My brother is about
to duel him.

32:13.649 --> 32:14.893
Welcome.

32:15.121 --> 32:16.877
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.

32:17.073 --> 32:19.560
'Cause this time things
are gonna be different.

32:22.545 --> 32:25.392
<i>Initiating duel simulation.</i>

32:25.585 --> 32:29.546
<i>Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.</i>

32:50.674 --> 32:52.910
I hope you've brought
your Egyptian God Cards.

32:53.074 --> 32:55.376
Otherwise, this duel isn't
gonna be any fun at all.

32:55.602 --> 33:00.337
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far
more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.

33:00.530 --> 33:02.439
<i>Spare me the fairy tales.</i>

33:02.706 --> 33:05.739
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.

33:05.970 --> 33:08.970
If you think you sense something
dangerous, you're absolutely right, -

33:09.170 --> 33:11.952
- because it's me and my deck,
and in this Duel Monsters match -

33:12.114 --> 33:13.870
- you're about to lose big-time.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.205
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.

33:16.433 --> 33:18.157
If you say so.

33:24.274 --> 33:26.183
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.

33:26.418 --> 33:29.418
Now what'd you say we get
down to business, already?

33:29.586 --> 33:32.455
Something tells me that this
duel is not a good idea.

33:32.658 --> 33:37.262
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself
for once and listen to what I'm telling you?

33:37.778 --> 33:40.560
You're in no position to
be making demands.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.208
So shut up and duel.

33:43.442 --> 33:46.289
And may the best duelist win.

33:47.570 --> 33:51.182
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.

33:53.107 --> 33:57.166
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.

33:57.427 --> 34:00.733
You've been taking credit for being
the best duelist for way too long.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.701
And to tell you the
truth I'm sick of it.

34:02.931 --> 34:08.495
By the time this duel is over, you'll be
exposed to the world as a total fraud.

34:10.387 --> 34:11.335
Let's duel!

34:11.571 --> 34:12.650
I'll start.

34:18.003 --> 34:22.760
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in
defence mode. Try and get past him.

34:22.963 --> 34:25.777
Very well, I shall.

34:29.811 --> 34:31.217
I play Queen's Knight.

34:33.715 --> 34:35.570
And now, say goodbye
to your monster.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.375
Queen's Knight, attack!

34:45.683 --> 34:49.327
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -

34:49.491 --> 34:52.306
- which allows you to play
a new beast in it's place.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.947
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would
he let Kaiba play a monster -

34:55.947 --> 34:58.897
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?

34:59.444 --> 35:03.056
And you're being so
helpful, because why?

35:03.251 --> 35:06.415
Because by doing so I also get
to summon a new monster.

35:06.868 --> 35:08.656
King's Knight.

35:10.868 --> 35:13.235
And these two knights
are in play I can -

35:13.428 --> 35:16.210
- automatically summon
my Jack's Knight.

35:18.580 --> 35:21.809
And next I place one card face down.

35:22.164 --> 35:23.952
Make your move.

35:28.404 --> 35:32.179
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -

35:32.403 --> 35:35.600
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.

35:35.764 --> 35:39.888
And then nothing in your deck will
make a difference. Your move, Yugi.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.946
An Egyptian God Card.

35:50.195 --> 35:54.931
I sacrifice my three knights to
bring forth my ultimate creature.

35:56.916 --> 35:59.982
Behold the Egyptian God Card:

36:00.181 --> 36:03.629
Slifer the Sky Dragon.

36:13.588 --> 36:17.166
Your monster is completely defenceless
against the devine power of Slifer.

36:17.461 --> 36:20.756
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!

36:27.892 --> 36:29.802
Had enough?

36:31.284 --> 36:33.805
Not only am I not afraid
of your God Cards -

36:34.004 --> 36:37.136
- but I'm gonna force you to
summon all three of them at once.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.329
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -

36:41.524 --> 36:44.142
- you have to bring out every monster
in your deck that falls into -

36:44.308 --> 36:47.243
- the same category as the one
that's on the field already.

36:47.477 --> 36:50.925
Very well. Then I play
two more God Cards.

36:51.157 --> 36:55.183
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.

37:15.254 --> 37:19.182
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest
and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -

37:19.381 --> 37:22.229
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.

37:24.789 --> 37:26.164
It's no mistake.

37:26.326 --> 37:30.581
My entire strategy was to draw out
your three Egyptian God Cards, -

37:30.805 --> 37:34.417
- so I can be the first duelist
to crush all of them at once.

37:34.614 --> 37:39.120
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.

37:39.318 --> 37:42.580
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.

37:44.149 --> 37:47.924
<i>So the Pyramid of Light is more
than just an ancient artifact.</i>

37:48.533 --> 37:50.672
<i>It's also a card.</i>

37:51.702 --> 37:53.611
Now pyramid, activate!

38:21.270 --> 38:25.361
Looks like your so called unstoppable
monsters have been stopped.

38:25.622 --> 38:27.280
Impossible.

38:27.542 --> 38:29.811
See for yourself.

38:30.903 --> 38:33.292
Wow, check it out.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.936
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?

38:44.566 --> 38:46.770
He actually did it.

38:51.734 --> 38:54.385
Yugi. What's this?

39:00.919 --> 39:03.340
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.

39:03.607 --> 39:06.640
This weird stuff always
happens when Yugi duels.

39:06.839 --> 39:11.247
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.

39:12.247 --> 39:16.240
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.

39:20.503 --> 39:22.413
What's going on?

39:29.751 --> 39:31.158
This is crazy.

39:53.143 --> 39:54.769
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.

39:55.032 --> 39:58.479
That blue beam is the same color of
the Pyramid of Light from the museum -

39:58.679 --> 40:00.435
- and I bet it's no coincidence.

40:00.599 --> 40:04.527
What ever is going on in there, one
thing's for sure: It can't be good.

40:05.015 --> 40:07.253
Yugi, where are you?

40:08.152 --> 40:12.047
Kaiba, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

40:12.217 --> 40:15.031
Well, let's see. I think I
have just beaten you.

40:29.432 --> 40:32.945
Hey, wait a sec. This place
looks kinda familiar.

40:33.144 --> 40:36.853
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.

40:37.016 --> 40:39.220
I've gotta find it so
we can reconnect.

40:41.369 --> 40:44.368
I'm pretty sure that one of
these rooms belongs to him.

40:44.568 --> 40:49.303
Question is, which one? There must
be a million doorways in this place.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.727
Oh, man I feel as bad
as you look, Joey.

40:59.384 --> 41:02.581
Tristan. I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

41:02.745 --> 41:07.982
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats.

41:08.216 --> 41:12.407
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?

41:13.177 --> 41:15.250
Pharaoh, are you here?

41:16.857 --> 41:18.417
Pharaoh?

41:20.761 --> 41:22.190
Nothing.

41:22.521 --> 41:26.798
Pharaoh!

41:27.737 --> 41:31.763
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.

41:41.529 --> 41:46.133
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your
faith in the Gods and they let you down.

41:46.329 --> 41:49.842
If I were you now is a good time
to start praying for mercy.

41:50.009 --> 41:53.970
Because from here on out, I'm planning
to take you apart piece by painful piece.

41:54.169 --> 41:56.471
So let the torture continue with this:

41:56.633 --> 41:59.415
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.

41:59.769 --> 42:02.616
Your face down card is destroyed.

42:03.225 --> 42:05.746
And if you like that, then
you're gonna love this:

42:05.977 --> 42:07.864
Peten the Dark Clown.

42:08.249 --> 42:11.697
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.

42:14.682 --> 42:18.097
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.

42:25.050 --> 42:28.695
And to top it off I'll place
this face down on the field.

42:29.114 --> 42:34.416
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.

42:34.650 --> 42:40.346
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.

42:48.730 --> 42:51.413
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew
you'd make that move, -

42:51.578 --> 42:55.801
- which is why my face down card
is Deck Destruction Virus.

42:56.730 --> 43:00.079
You set off this cribleling trap when
you destroyed my Dark Clown, -

43:00.314 --> 43:03.892
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect
ten random cards from your deck -

43:04.058 --> 43:07.320
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.

43:07.546 --> 43:12.368
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye
to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.

43:19.195 --> 43:20.504
No.

43:20.667 --> 43:23.350
I hate to be the bearer
of even more bad news, -

43:23.515 --> 43:25.752
- but when you destroyed
my Peten the Dark Clown, -

43:25.915 --> 43:29.079
- you activated his special ability,
allowing me to summon another -

43:29.275 --> 43:31.697
- Dark Clown to take his place.

43:42.427 --> 43:45.591
I summon Des Feral Imp.

43:45.819 --> 43:49.080
And next I'll activate the
magical Card of Demise.

43:49.275 --> 43:51.730
It let's me draw five new
cards from my deck.

43:51.962 --> 43:55.759
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.

43:56.027 --> 44:00.784
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and
activate White Dragon Ritual -

44:01.275 --> 44:04.177
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.

44:04.411 --> 44:07.858
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.

44:19.003 --> 44:23.738
When I lose my life points I'm
losing my actual life energy.

44:24.572 --> 44:28.346
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

44:30.300 --> 44:31.827
Take a good look.

44:31.996 --> 44:35.062
It's the monster that's been the bane
of your dueling existence ever since -

44:35.260 --> 44:37.813
- our first match. And now he's back.

44:38.396 --> 44:40.218
But he's not alone.

44:40.412 --> 44:43.096
Any last requests?

44:52.220 --> 44:54.107
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!

44:56.572 --> 44:57.946
Where did he go?

45:02.588 --> 45:05.174
Hey, hold on!

45:06.139 --> 45:08.212
This isn't his room.

45:15.291 --> 45:17.747
Pharaoh. Oh, no.

45:21.276 --> 45:23.099
Who's there?

45:48.477 --> 45:51.576
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?

45:54.748 --> 45:56.155
Hi.

45:57.372 --> 46:00.787
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?

46:10.876 --> 46:13.811
Woaw, it looks like an
earthquake hit this place.

46:15.741 --> 46:19.702
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.

46:20.285 --> 46:23.219
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?

46:23.421 --> 46:25.909
He's in there and so is my brother.

46:27.422 --> 46:30.717
- What is it?
- I don't know.

46:30.910 --> 46:35.612
Looks like that artifact we saw back at
the museum, only this one's super-sized.

46:35.806 --> 46:38.970
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.

46:39.165 --> 46:42.962
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?

46:43.198 --> 46:47.573
Anubis once tried to destroy the world
using the power of the Pyramid of Light.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.871
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.

46:51.070 --> 46:54.037
All of this insanity started when
my brother played a card that -

46:54.238 --> 46:57.718
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -

46:57.950 --> 46:59.892
- from 5000 years ago.

47:00.125 --> 47:04.981
And if the myth is true then Anubis is
using it to finish was he started in the past.

47:05.214 --> 47:08.563
This is crazy. We gotta get
them out of there.

47:09.918 --> 47:12.339
I don't know what dark
powers are at work here -

47:12.542 --> 47:14.549
- but I can't let them go unchecked.

47:14.749 --> 47:18.492
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -

47:18.654 --> 47:21.752
- and I'll boost her strength
with Mage Power.

47:23.518 --> 47:26.136
It may cost me 800 life points, -

47:29.438 --> 47:33.268
- but my Valkyria now gains 500
attack and defence points

47:33.503 --> 47:37.943
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.

47:41.918 --> 47:44.984
1000 additional attack
points make my Valkyria -

47:45.183 --> 47:48.532
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -

47:48.798 --> 47:51.733
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.

47:53.950 --> 47:59.318
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.

48:03.294 --> 48:05.465
- A trap.
- Very observant.

48:05.662 --> 48:08.412
Now your attack is diverted.

48:09.502 --> 48:12.252
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -

48:12.415 --> 48:15.098
- it infects ten more
cards in your deck.

48:22.750 --> 48:25.500
I've lost half the cards
in my deck already.

48:26.046 --> 48:29.462
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -

48:29.662 --> 48:31.802
- who just hates to say goodbye.

48:36.064 --> 48:37.973
And next... -

48:39.040 --> 48:41.428
- I'm gonna summon up
your worst nightmare.

48:41.663 --> 48:44.729
Because if you couldn't
defeat one Blue-Eyes... -

48:46.080 --> 48:48.829
- there's no way you'll
defeat three, -

48:49.023 --> 48:54.424
- especially when combined as
the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

48:54.816 --> 48:59.605
If you think he's scary now, just wait
till he attacks. In fact don't wait.

49:00.224 --> 49:03.835
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.

49:17.791 --> 49:20.791
Look at the world's
best duelist now.

49:23.583 --> 49:26.812
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?

49:29.951 --> 49:32.090
Yugi, what the heck is going on?

49:32.352 --> 49:34.719
We've been drawn into
the Millennium Puzzle -

49:34.912 --> 49:36.800
- and that thing up there is
somehow responsible.

49:37.248 --> 49:39.190
Then what's that, down there?

49:40.064 --> 49:43.512
That blue one looks like the Pyramid
of Light I saw at the museum.

49:44.033 --> 49:47.961
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the
crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.

49:48.160 --> 49:51.095
Fighting pyramides and creepy
floating eyes. Wonderful.

49:51.328 --> 49:54.198
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -

49:54.400 --> 49:58.556
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?

49:58.976 --> 50:00.438
Maybe.

50:01.184 --> 50:04.762
I think this all has to do with
an ancient Egyptian sorceror.

50:04.993 --> 50:07.000
I knew it was gonna
be something insane.

50:07.232 --> 50:10.199
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

50:10.432 --> 50:12.090
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.

50:12.321 --> 50:15.616
Centuries ago he tried to destroy
the world and I'm starting to believe -

50:15.840 --> 50:18.207
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?

50:18.368 --> 50:22.907
<i>The eye that sees what's yet
to come its vision shall be fulfilled -</i>

50:23.168 --> 50:25.950
<i>- unless blinded by events
predetermined.</i>

50:26.112 --> 50:28.251
<i>Thus light and shadows
both be killed.</i>

50:32.352 --> 50:35.319
Doesn't look like the duel's going too
well for your friend the pharaoh.

50:35.521 --> 50:39.002
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -

50:39.201 --> 50:41.331
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.

50:41.332 --> 50:44.896
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -

50:45.089 --> 50:46.583
- we can outrun them.

50:56.994 --> 51:00.572
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it
only gets worse from here.

51:01.697 --> 51:05.471
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -

51:05.634 --> 51:08.667
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.

51:08.897 --> 51:12.443
No. That Pyramid of Light has
created a deadly Shadow Game.

51:12.609 --> 51:15.707
I know you sense it we must stop now.

51:16.001 --> 51:18.793
The only thing I sense is your
fear. Not that I blame you.

51:18.794 --> 51:22.071
But I came here to win and
stopping's not an option.

51:22.369 --> 51:27.158
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel,
when clearly I should have been champion.

51:27.393 --> 51:31.517
For all the times I'd had to listen to your
preach about the heart of the cards.

51:31.745 --> 51:36.448
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.

51:37.185 --> 51:42.369
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously
over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.

51:42.562 --> 51:46.818
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.

51:47.458 --> 51:51.036
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.

51:56.770 --> 52:00.828
Next I reveal my face
down card, Sage's Stone.

52:00.994 --> 52:04.791
When Dark Magician Girl is on the
field and Sage's Stone is played, -

52:04.994 --> 52:07.962
- it allows me to automatically
summon Dark Magician.

52:10.146 --> 52:12.994
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.

52:13.250 --> 52:15.933
For now I sacrifice both magicians -

52:16.098 --> 52:19.546
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.

52:22.754 --> 52:27.009
And with his rise to power comes
your Blue-Eyes far from grace.

52:27.234 --> 52:30.715
Because for everyone of my sorceror's
fallen comrades in the graveyard -

52:30.914 --> 52:34.013
- your dragon loses 500 points.

52:34.786 --> 52:38.845
And right now there have been
three magicians laid down to rest, -

52:39.010 --> 52:45.175
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's
power decreases by 1500 points.

52:46.531 --> 52:50.393
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.

52:50.659 --> 52:55.842
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.

53:04.611 --> 53:06.553
Now, will you stop this madness?

53:06.787 --> 53:09.176
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.

53:10.947 --> 53:16.413
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.

53:16.611 --> 53:20.866
No, I'll have no monsters on the
field to defend my life points.

53:21.091 --> 53:25.347
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!

53:29.507 --> 53:31.230
You may have destroyed my
clown, but you forgot about -

53:31.427 --> 53:34.209
- Deck Virus Trap Card.

53:34.435 --> 53:39.770
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out.

53:42.018 --> 53:43.906
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...

53:44.067 --> 53:47.167
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic
mystic's powers are so mighty, -

53:47.364 --> 53:51.194
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards,
like your Deck Virus and destroy it.

53:51.428 --> 53:55.290
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.

54:00.004 --> 54:03.353
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.

54:04.036 --> 54:08.127
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.

54:08.356 --> 54:09.763
- What?
- That's right.

54:09.988 --> 54:14.844
You see I have an even more powerful
monster, compliments of Pegasus.

54:15.044 --> 54:20.543
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

54:36.387 --> 54:39.551
Could it be? A card I'd
never seen before?

54:39.716 --> 54:41.855
And for every dragon in my graveyard -

54:42.084 --> 54:46.591
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains
an additional 300 attack points.

54:47.108 --> 54:50.589
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -

54:50.788 --> 54:53.920
- for at punishing grand
total of 4500 points.

54:57.669 --> 55:00.702
But don't forget, due to
my sorceres' powers, -

55:00.933 --> 55:04.643
- your new dragon's attack
points decrease by 1500.

55:04.836 --> 55:09.408
I don't think so. Thanks to my
dragon's Shining Diffusion.

55:11.397 --> 55:13.121
What, your points didn't decrease.

55:13.317 --> 55:17.594
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -

55:17.989 --> 55:21.022
- or Monster Effect Cards
can be used against him.

55:21.477 --> 55:24.772
Just face it, Yugi, your days as
a champion duelist are over.

55:24.965 --> 55:28.226
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast
you back to the minor leagues -

55:28.388 --> 55:29.665
- where you belong.

55:29.892 --> 55:34.594
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.

55:49.637 --> 55:55.334
How do you like it? The pain, the
sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.

55:57.926 --> 55:59.617
Now it's your turn.

56:05.382 --> 56:07.585
You're sure this is the
way to that mummy guy?

56:07.782 --> 56:10.597
Yeah, every hallway
looks the same.

56:11.366 --> 56:13.471
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.557
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.

56:17.701 --> 56:20.865
Check it out. It's some
kind of energy stream.

56:21.350 --> 56:24.797
Maybe if we follow this thing,
it'll lead us to Anubis.

56:25.029 --> 56:27.746
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.

56:37.446 --> 56:41.756
It's putting out energy waves that
are making my pacemaker go haywire.

57:01.287 --> 57:02.716
Up here!

57:05.606 --> 57:08.454
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?

57:20.839 --> 57:22.813
Pegasus, what are you doing here?

57:23.015 --> 57:25.862
How about we start with a
thank you, you little ingrate?

57:26.022 --> 57:30.179
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid
of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.

57:30.406 --> 57:34.367
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me
when in fact this is all been arranged by an -

57:34.535 --> 57:38.080
- evil lord who tried to take over the
world five millennia ago and is now back -

57:38.311 --> 57:40.700
- to finish the job. I looked it up.

57:40.999 --> 57:44.294
Now, this Anubis has created
the ultimate Shadow Game -

57:44.487 --> 57:48.415
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.

57:48.679 --> 57:51.679
And Yugi and Kaiba are
right in the middle of it.

57:51.911 --> 57:54.300
We just gotta find a
way to help them.

57:58.599 --> 58:01.185
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.

58:21.191 --> 58:25.698
<i>Foolish mortals there is nothing
you can do to stop my rebirth.</i>

58:25.864 --> 58:31.079
<i>I have infiltrated the realm of the
pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.</i>

58:31.272 --> 58:35.068
We won't stand here while you suck
the life out of others to save yourself.

58:35.272 --> 58:39.396
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.

58:39.591 --> 58:43.072
Yeah, because just in case you haven't
noticed, we've got you outnumbered.

58:52.359 --> 58:54.563
This place is crawling with stiffs.

58:58.760 --> 59:00.167
What do you want, anyway?

59:00.359 --> 59:05.598
<i>Behold the future since you won't
live to see it for yourself.</i>

59:07.272 --> 59:12.989
<i>Soon my beasts of destruction shall
annihilate all traces of life on Earth.</i>

59:13.192 --> 59:18.310
<i>And I will finally complete that
which I started millennia ago.</i>

59:20.904 --> 59:26.174
<i>It is by your very hand that this
devastation will occur, mortal.</i>

59:26.376 --> 59:30.817
<i>For when you released the
pharaoh, you released me as well.</i>

59:31.016 --> 59:32.292
What's he mean?

59:32.456 --> 59:34.212
This is between me and him.

59:34.376 --> 59:37.792
Listen, you guys need to find a way
outta this place and save yourselves.

59:37.992 --> 59:41.091
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?

59:41.288 --> 59:44.005
There was a prophecy my grandpa
read to me in the museum.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.909
And I think it may have something to
do with this. I just don't know what.

59:48.104 --> 59:49.348
Yugi, that's crazy.

59:49.641 --> 59:50.720
Just go guys.

59:50.953 --> 59:54.084
Wait there's no way we're
leaving you, we're team.

59:54.249 --> 59:58.177
We've been through everything together and
there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.

59:58.408 --> 01:00:00.383
- That's right.
- But...

01:00:00.584 --> 01:00:04.163
The last thing I wanna do is
put my best friends in danger.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:11.584
What are you doing? Téa, please,
get down from there.

01:00:11.785 --> 01:00:14.436
My friends need me. I just know it.

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:18.920
Foolish girl.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.999
Téa, come back in here at once.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.824
I've got to help my friends.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:29.446
- She's falling.
- Grab her.

01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:46.336
I'm coming, guys!

01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:50.248
- Téa.
- How did you find us?

01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:54.085
Are you kidding me? Remember
the friendship symbol we drew?

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:57.161
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.655
- bond never will.
- Right.

01:00:59.882 --> 01:01:04.038
We're all with you. And we're
always be with you.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:07.593
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.

01:01:07.786 --> 01:01:09.193
- Yeah.
- Right.

01:01:10.026 --> 01:01:13.856
You see? There's nothing out there that's
more powerful than our friendship.

01:01:14.122 --> 01:01:18.148
Téa is right. I can feel it. All we
have to do is stick together.

01:01:18.378 --> 01:01:20.679
Hey, stick it together,
is what we do best.

01:01:20.906 --> 01:01:22.793
We'll never leave your side.

01:01:23.594 --> 01:01:26.343
- Téa.
<i>- Your pathetic little bond -</i>

01:01:26.506 --> 01:01:28.579
<i>- is nothing against my power.</i>

01:01:28.778 --> 01:01:34.212
<i>Soon my soul will be fully restored
and your world shrouded in darkness.</i>

01:01:34.443 --> 01:01:37.606
<i>Yet, you fools prate along
about togetherness?</i>

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:41.952
<i>- Then so be it.
- Téa!</i>

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:47.592
- Téa!
- What's out!

01:01:52.618 --> 01:01:54.407
What? I can do that.

01:02:01.354 --> 01:02:04.202
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.

01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:08.071
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.

01:02:08.234 --> 01:02:09.641
Take this.

01:02:14.155 --> 01:02:16.195
That wasn't suppose to happen.

01:02:16.715 --> 01:02:19.715
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.

01:02:19.915 --> 01:02:21.803
Neither do kicks to the head.

01:02:22.763 --> 01:02:24.999
Let's try this.

01:02:26.187 --> 01:02:27.648
These carcasses won't quit.

01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:30.566
How do you destroy
what's already dead?

01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:35.818
It's no use. They just keep coming.

01:02:44.779 --> 01:02:46.753
How the mighty has fallen.

01:02:46.955 --> 01:02:50.599
Lying there on the ground like a dog
waiting to be put out of it's misery.

01:02:50.795 --> 01:02:54.788
Get up, get up so I can
knock you back down.

01:02:56.363 --> 01:02:59.429
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.

01:02:59.659 --> 01:03:02.594
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -

01:03:02.827 --> 01:03:07.584
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.

01:03:08.203 --> 01:03:11.781
But believe me, I cannot
let you win this duel.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.609
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:21.000
You know I think you're the one who doesn't
have clue what this match is really about.

01:03:21.196 --> 01:03:23.106
It's about pay back.

01:03:26.188 --> 01:03:28.424
And this card will see to that.

01:03:31.148 --> 01:03:34.531
But first let's deal with your
so-called Big Shield Gardna.

01:03:34.764 --> 01:03:37.642
Do you think it's big enough
to block the power of -

01:03:37.643 --> 01:03:40.577
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?

01:03:44.236 --> 01:03:47.814
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.

01:03:48.684 --> 01:03:52.775
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:04.835
I told you when we started this duel -

01:04:05.036 --> 01:04:07.491
- that this time things were
gonna be different, Yugi.

01:04:07.724 --> 01:04:09.928
You may have beaten
me in the past, -

01:04:10.092 --> 01:04:13.867
- but now there's nothing you can do
to stop me from having my revenge.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.750
You're finished.

01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:17.996
Not yet. I'm not.

01:04:19.885 --> 01:04:23.845
I activate Pot of Greed which
let's me draw two cards.

01:04:28.012 --> 01:04:30.216
Now I summon Watapon
in defense mode.

01:04:30.445 --> 01:04:32.998
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -

01:04:33.229 --> 01:04:35.650
- I can summon another
monster to the field.

01:04:35.885 --> 01:04:39.846
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.281
So let me see if I've
got this right, now.

01:04:42.477 --> 01:04:45.127
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.

01:04:45.357 --> 01:04:47.397
Well, then it's your funeral.

01:04:47.629 --> 01:04:52.233
First the Card of Demise I played before
sends this dragon to the graveyard.

01:04:52.429 --> 01:04:54.730
And I know you know what
that means, don't you?

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:58.722
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has
more destructive power than ever before.

01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:00.813
Kaiba, please listen to me.

01:05:01.004 --> 01:05:05.161
All I wanna hear from you is
your anguished cry of defeat.

01:05:05.837 --> 01:05:09.732
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:13.132
People are getting hurt,
lives are in danger.

01:05:13.325 --> 01:05:17.384
And this Pyramid of Light you've
created is source of it all.

01:05:17.805 --> 01:05:20.588
There's a dark power in our
midst and you can't deny it.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:25.005
With every life point lost, we both
become weaker. I know you can feel it.

01:05:25.613 --> 01:05:28.461
We must stop. Before it's too late.

01:05:28.654 --> 01:05:32.330
<i>Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi
now with my Shining Dragon -</i>

01:05:32.494 --> 01:05:34.828
<i>- and destroy the rest
of his life points.</i>

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:37.292
<i>No, I should stick to
my original strategy -</i>

01:05:37.485 --> 01:05:40.551
<i>- and defeat Yugi with his
very own Egyptian God Cards.</i>

01:05:40.814 --> 01:05:43.662
I'm afraid that for you
it's already too late, Yugi.

01:05:43.918 --> 01:05:48.293
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this
we still have time to stop this madness.

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:50.698
All we have to do is end this duel.

01:05:50.894 --> 01:05:55.563
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.

01:05:55.758 --> 01:05:59.467
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate
your final special ability.

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:03.272
No, you're playing with forces
you can't possibly understand.

01:06:03.534 --> 01:06:05.443
<i>Finish him. Finish him, now!</i>

01:06:05.646 --> 01:06:08.613
<i>No, I wanted a perfect victory,
and with this card I can -</i>

01:06:08.846 --> 01:06:12.141
<i>- use Yugi's own most
powerful monsters against him.</i>

01:06:12.397 --> 01:06:15.048
I use Shining Nova.

01:06:15.246 --> 01:06:18.442
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes
into a blast so strong it -

01:06:18.606 --> 01:06:21.323
- destroys itself plus
anything I choose.

01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:24.846
And the card that will feel the wrath
of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -

01:06:25.007 --> 01:06:26.414
- is the Pyramid of Light.

01:06:26.606 --> 01:06:29.028
<i>No, I need the pyramid
to destroy the pharaoh.</i>

01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:33.387
<i>What am I saying? I must destroy
it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.</i>

01:06:34.255 --> 01:06:36.622
Your reign as the King
of Games is over.

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:41.223
That title will be mine as will all
three of your Egyptian God Cards.

01:06:41.454 --> 01:06:44.138
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon
sacrifice yourself -

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.723
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:02.956
<i>This I cannot allow.</i>

01:07:03.215 --> 01:07:05.604
What? The Pyramid of Light
wasn't destroyed?

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:11.720
<i>The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.</i>

01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:14.853
Hey, what is this? Show yourself,
whoever you are.

01:07:15.118 --> 01:07:19.210
<i>I have been here the whole time,
mortal, whispering in your ear.</i>

01:07:19.439 --> 01:07:22.603
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.

01:07:23.182 --> 01:07:25.387
Kaiba. Look out!

01:07:31.279 --> 01:07:32.708
Kaiba. No!

01:07:32.912 --> 01:07:35.562
You have served
me well, little worm, -

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.175
- but you have outlived
your usefulness.

01:07:54.544 --> 01:07:58.472
So it's been you behind this whole
duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.

01:07:58.671 --> 01:08:01.454
The Egyptian Lord of
the Dead, Anubis.

01:08:01.616 --> 01:08:05.772
I am pleased that you remember me
after all these years, my pharaoh.

01:08:05.935 --> 01:08:09.099
It will make my ultimate
vengence all the more sweeter.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.288
You will fall and my reign of
destruction shall begin.

01:08:13.679 --> 01:08:16.549
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -

01:08:16.751 --> 01:08:19.653
- have already fallen, trapped
within your puzzle.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:23.368
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:26.120
You're wrong. I can still
sense their presence.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:28.261
And I will fight to defend them.

01:08:28.528 --> 01:08:32.837
No matter what happens, I will not let
your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.

01:08:33.072 --> 01:08:36.269
All I need due is defeat
you in this duel.

01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:40.555
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.265
The magic of the Shadow Games that
you locked away centuries ago -

01:08:44.432 --> 01:08:46.952
- will once again be unleashed
into the world.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.462
And I shall finally take my rightful place,
as the pharaoh of this realm.

01:08:51.857 --> 01:08:54.158
With the Pyramid of Light
at my command -

01:08:54.608 --> 01:08:56.997
- there's nothing you
can do to stop me.

01:08:58.064 --> 01:09:02.439
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.

01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:29.390
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:40.261
<i>Reverse of Reverse.</i>

01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:44.814
Search your deck from
now until doomsday.

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:49.679
And you still won't find anything to stand
against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.

01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:54.576
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that
for you doomsday is today.

01:09:57.938 --> 01:10:02.345
Now watch as your last line of defense
is ripped to shreds before your eyes.

01:10:02.545 --> 01:10:05.927
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.356
My Celtic Guardian. No.

01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:17.165
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:24.519
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -

01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:27.569
- half of that monster's attack
points are taken away -

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:32.431
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.

01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:34.414
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.

01:10:37.714 --> 01:10:42.799
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon
you will be the relic burried away.

01:10:42.994 --> 01:10:47.948
Soon worms will feast on your flesh,
just as they did on mine.

01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:54.315
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.

01:10:54.642 --> 01:10:57.511
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.

01:10:59.698 --> 01:11:02.480
That's all I have left.

01:11:06.611 --> 01:11:09.644
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:13.965
That eye up there seems
to be his power source.

01:11:14.578 --> 01:11:16.717
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.

01:11:16.882 --> 01:11:20.526
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -

01:11:20.722 --> 01:11:23.210
- unless blinded by events
predetermined.

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.312
Predetermined events is just
another way of saying fate.

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:29.198
The prophecy means the eye
can be blinded by fate.

01:11:29.938 --> 01:11:32.207
Heads up, you freak!

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:35.657
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.

01:11:35.922 --> 01:11:38.606
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.

01:11:38.771 --> 01:11:42.251
If I'm right I gotta find
that Dagger of Fate.

01:11:45.203 --> 01:11:48.400
Yugi, please hurry!

01:11:49.523 --> 01:11:53.135
It's empty. Please be in
here somewhere. Yes.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:57.643
Here it is.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:01.323
Let's just hope that
fate is on our side.

01:12:02.995 --> 01:12:04.556
Come on!

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.759
No!

01:12:15.763 --> 01:12:18.578
<i>A weakness in the Pyramid's power.</i>

01:12:20.435 --> 01:12:21.809
I activate Double Spell.

01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:24.872
By discarding one card from my
hand, I can select a new one -

01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:28.239
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.

01:12:30.419 --> 01:12:33.550
And I know just the card I want.

01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:40.043
Monster Reborn.

01:12:40.243 --> 01:12:44.106
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

01:12:50.356 --> 01:12:54.731
And I have a hunch this time, your
pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.

01:12:54.964 --> 01:12:56.491
Go, Shining Nova.

01:12:56.788 --> 01:13:00.814
Use all your power to finish
what you started before -

01:13:01.012 --> 01:13:03.761
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.543
Impossible.

01:13:53.173 --> 01:13:57.428
And with that I'll end my turn, now
that the Pyramid of Light is gone.

01:13:57.621 --> 01:14:01.516
Your opponent tried and failed to
destroy the pyramid with that dragon.

01:14:01.973 --> 01:14:03.828
You alone couldn't make
such a difference.

01:14:03.989 --> 01:14:06.771
You're quite right that I could
not have done it all alone.

01:14:06.965 --> 01:14:09.234
You may have destroyed
the card, pharaoh, -

01:14:09.429 --> 01:14:14.480
- but not the Pyramid of Light around
my neck. Behold its power.

01:14:15.988 --> 01:14:21.204
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.

01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:26.382
Thenien the Great Sphinx.

01:14:28.693 --> 01:14:34.857
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this
perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.

01:14:45.365 --> 01:14:49.556
Hey look. Tell me that
attack meter is broke.

01:14:49.974 --> 01:14:52.756
Say hello, Thenien.

01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:58.446
5000 years ago, I
never had the chance -

01:14:58.646 --> 01:15:00.685
- to summon Thenien to our battle.

01:15:00.854 --> 01:15:04.171
So I think it'd be best if
we made up for lost time -

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:06.708
- and finally had a
proper introduction.

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:11.277
Thenien, meet the pharaoh,
and pharaoh meet your doom.

01:15:12.277 --> 01:15:14.382
<i>We don't have anything
that can beat that sphinx.</i>

01:15:14.614 --> 01:15:18.989
<i>Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct
about what Kaiba was planning.</i>

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.202
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -

01:15:21.366 --> 01:15:24.214
- and I still have one face
down card to play.

01:15:24.405 --> 01:15:25.682
Reverse of Reverse, -

01:15:25.846 --> 01:15:30.036
- which allows me to use the
last card played by Kaiba:

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.446
Return from the Different Dimension.

01:15:34.646 --> 01:15:37.363
When Kaiba spoke of dealing
me the perfect defeat, -

01:15:37.526 --> 01:15:41.355
- he meant wiping me out
with my own Egyptian Gods.

01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:49.237
Allow me to introduce Obelisk
the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -

01:15:49.494 --> 01:15:51.350
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.

01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:57.653
My Egyptian Gods, combine
now! For infinite power.

01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:15.180
Now go, Titan Firestorm!

01:16:35.094 --> 01:16:37.004
No.

01:16:41.462 --> 01:16:43.470
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!

01:16:43.671 --> 01:16:45.613
Yeah!

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:59.093
- You did it.
- We did it.

01:17:06.679 --> 01:17:10.094
Kaiba. Are you all right?

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.781
Let me help you.

01:17:12.984 --> 01:17:15.188
I can take care of myself.

01:17:24.919 --> 01:17:27.058
What the...?

01:17:28.759 --> 01:17:32.589
<i>Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.</i>

01:17:32.791 --> 01:17:38.006
<i>Now let see how well you play this game,
when the monsters are real.</i>

01:17:38.648 --> 01:17:40.819
- Monsters?
- For real?

01:17:41.016 --> 01:17:46.450
<i>It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.</i>

01:17:59.896 --> 01:18:04.174
<i>Nothing in your decks of
cards can save you now.</i>

01:18:11.672 --> 01:18:14.968
<i>It appears you are one
card short, pharaoh.</i>

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.430
Yeah, but I'm not.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:22.671
Attack! Gilford the Lightning
and Gearfried the Iron Knight.

01:18:22.905 --> 01:18:25.294
<i>Begone!</i>

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:38.066
<i>You have no concept of my powers
and now the end begins.</i>

01:18:47.544 --> 01:18:49.911
We're pancakes.

01:18:52.153 --> 01:18:53.746
Not yet.

01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:57.016
These Toon Monsters
won't last long.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.089
We have to get out of here,
while we still have the chance.

01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:02.104
Yugi, I know you'll take
this creep down.

01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:04.850
Yes, you would, 'cause we will
be with you all the way.

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.024
- Always.
- Always.

01:19:09.594 --> 01:19:11.798
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.

01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:38.168
How can we beat a real monster?

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.886
How? With a real monster.

01:19:41.049 --> 01:19:43.351
- Yugi.
- What's this?

01:19:43.577 --> 01:19:46.130
The one card that can beat him.

01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:49.331
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

01:19:54.266 --> 01:19:55.989
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!

01:19:56.282 --> 01:19:58.965
If the monsters are real,
so are all their powers -

01:19:59.129 --> 01:20:02.840
- including this dragon's ability
to destroy any monster.

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:11.537
Destroy Anubis!

01:20:16.474 --> 01:20:19.256
Wow, check it out.

01:20:23.674 --> 01:20:25.267
No!

01:21:28.859 --> 01:21:31.030
He's not coming back again, right?

01:21:32.091 --> 01:21:36.346
We should take a closer look at that prophecy
to see what it foretells for the future.

01:21:36.507 --> 01:21:38.962
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:43.319
No one could return after suffering a
defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.

01:21:43.515 --> 01:21:46.166
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.

01:21:46.395 --> 01:21:49.210
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.437
Oh, please, spare me all your
bull about friendship, will ya?

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:55.384
If it wasn't for that freak crashing
the party we both know that -

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.427
- the winner of todays duel
would have been me.

01:21:58.619 --> 01:22:02.230
So enjoy your last days of being
champion. Why you still can.

01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:05.077
I gotta say it's nice to
have the old Kaiba back.

01:22:05.307 --> 01:22:09.618
Yeah? Well this conversation's
over. We'll duel again.

01:22:10.812 --> 01:22:12.699
Wait up!

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:17.493
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all
the damage you did to the Duel Dome.

01:22:17.692 --> 01:22:19.961
'Cause I don't think his
insurance is gonna cover this.

01:22:20.156 --> 01:22:23.472
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.

01:22:23.676 --> 01:22:26.839
And unless he changes he won't
have best friends like this.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.467
What Kaiba doesn't get is
that victory means nothing, -

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:32.180
- unless you can share it
with the people you love.

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.617
'Cause then...

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.566
You're really a winner.

01:22:36.764 --> 01:22:38.520
You can say that again.

01:22:50.737 --> 01:22:58.409
