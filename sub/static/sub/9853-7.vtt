00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:05.086 --> 00:06.467
I've gathered you here at dawn

00:06.467 --> 00:09.050
because we have
a very important mission,

00:09.050 --> 00:10.841
and we're under the gun.

00:10.841 --> 00:12.933
It's go time, people.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.436
I'm first.
I really gotta go.

00:15.436 --> 00:17.398
Eww, gross.
Not that kind of go.

00:17.398 --> 00:19.400
Everybody hold it in
until we're done.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.312
You've got three minutes.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.444
After that, I can't
promise anything.

00:23.444 --> 00:25.526
Today is Mother's Day,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.408
and we have to make
our gift for Mom.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.910
Right. Just let us know
when you're finished making it

00:29.910 --> 00:32.743
- so we can sign the card.
- I know, right?

00:32.743 --> 00:35.496
This is what happens when you're
the idea person in the family.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.328
The one who gets things done.

00:37.328 --> 00:40.711
You wind up doing all the work
 and sharing all the credit.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.463
Finished.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.626
Check this out.

00:45.626 --> 00:48.048
Buenos Diaz.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.472
Get it. "Buenos Diaz"?

00:51.472 --> 00:53.304
Mom's gonna love it.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.306
Yeah, yeah, we'll sign the card
during the commercial.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.438
You're doing the card,
too, right?

00:59.140 --> 01:02.943
Aww! Thank you guys
so much.

01:02.943 --> 01:06.026
You always come up with
just the right thing.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.150
Buenos Diaz.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.362
Look. We're on the clock.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.244
You already gave it to her?

01:13.244 --> 01:15.246
Shoot. I knew someone
was missing.

01:17.748 --> 01:20.411
Every year, I come up with
a special gift for Mom

01:20.411 --> 01:22.373
while you guys sit around
and do nothing.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.505
That's because you're like
a superhero, Harley.

01:24.505 --> 01:26.337
You're Inventor Girl.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.549
On your watch,
we all feel safe doing nothing.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.381
I'm not the only
superhero in this family.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.553
We all have special talents.

01:32.553 --> 01:36.557
Yeah, but arm farts aren't
much of a Mother's Day gift.

01:36.557 --> 01:39.140
Or are they?

01:42.563 --> 01:44.815
These would be
the worst superheroes ever.

01:44.815 --> 01:47.938
I mean, what would
their super powers be?

01:47.938 --> 01:49.400
Nonstop texting.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.611
Standing around watching.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.193
Drawing in the margins.

01:52.193 --> 01:53.574
Digging through trash.

01:53.574 --> 01:55.496
And forget about
these ding-dongs.

01:55.496 --> 01:57.738
This gang is the opposite
of super.

01:57.738 --> 02:00.201
Even our secret hideout
is the bathroom.

02:00.201 --> 02:02.793
Come on. This is about
all of us showing Mom

02:02.793 --> 02:05.586
how much we love
and appreciate her.

02:05.586 --> 02:06.877
We all need to step up.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.509
Not our fault. You enable us.

02:09.509 --> 02:10.461
Make the gift.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.383
( all agreeing )

02:12.383 --> 02:14.425
You know what?
If that's how you want it,

02:14.425 --> 02:16.387
you're on your own.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.559
This year, my gift will be
just from me.

02:18.559 --> 02:21.522
Mom will finally see
who cares about her most.

02:21.522 --> 02:23.023
( knocking on door )

02:23.023 --> 02:24.645
SUZY: Harley, it's your day
to fold the laundry.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.527
I'll get to it
when I get to it!

02:26.527 --> 02:27.568
Happy Mother's Day.

gifts.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.383
Not to sound cocky,
but I've got the perfect thing.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.134
Flowers, candy?

03:34.134 --> 03:36.337
That's not what the mom
of seven needs.

03:36.337 --> 03:39.260
GEORGIE: Mom, we need
more toilet paper.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.262
Hold on, I'll get it.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.144
ETHAN: Mom, we need
more toilet paper.

03:44.144 --> 03:46.267
Hold on.
I'll get it.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.939
BEAST: Mom, we need
more toilet paper.

03:48.939 --> 03:51.692
Never mind.
I'll use the bathmat.

03:51.692 --> 03:54.905
No, no. Hold on, hold on.
I'll get it.

03:54.905 --> 03:58.028
The perfect gift for
the mother of seven lazy kids.

04:00.911 --> 04:04.204
A 12-roll automatic
toilet paper changer.

04:04.204 --> 04:06.206
The gift that
keeps on giving...

04:06.206 --> 04:07.788
in the most important
of times.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.002
That's what you wanna do
on your special day?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.584
Go to the grocery store?

04:13.584 --> 04:16.677
Yep. I'm off to get
a bed full of snacks

04:16.677 --> 04:18.509
so I can lie around
all afternoon

04:18.509 --> 04:20.591
and binge watch
 Heatherton Cottage.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.383
Hey, Mom.

04:22.383 --> 04:24.515
If you had to name
your top five presents,

04:24.515 --> 04:25.726
what would they be?

04:25.726 --> 04:27.187
Starting from
least expensive

04:27.187 --> 04:29.520
and keeping them
all around there.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.982
Right now, all I want
is to go shopping

04:31.982 --> 04:35.025
without anyone fighting
or hanging off my legs.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.737
All right,
let's hit the store.

04:36.737 --> 04:39.490
What part of "without
anyone" did you not understand?

04:43.744 --> 04:45.456
Hey, Harley.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.997
Ow!

04:46.997 --> 04:50.371
Sorry. Test phase.
Still working out the kinks.

04:50.371 --> 04:53.584
You know what? I deserved
that toilet paper bullet

04:53.584 --> 04:55.756
because I've been
acting like a poop.

04:55.756 --> 04:57.968
Your speech about pulling
together to make Mom a gift

04:57.968 --> 04:59.340
really got to me.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.593
I'm glad I have
11 more rolls here,

05:02.593 --> 05:04.845
- because that was
a real load of doody.
- ( huffs )

05:04.845 --> 05:07.518
All right, I couldn't
think of anything,

05:07.518 --> 05:08.769
and I knew you'd
make the best gift.

05:08.769 --> 05:11.061
Fine. But if you wanna be
on Team Harley,

05:11.061 --> 05:12.983
you gotta dish on
Team Lazy.

05:12.983 --> 05:14.645
What are the other kids doing?

05:14.645 --> 05:17.107
Rachel and Daphne are just
buying Mom something.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.819
Ooh. Store-bought gift.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.701
Not personal.
Even worse,

05:20.701 --> 05:22.653
they're raising money
by selling brownies.

05:22.653 --> 05:26.577
Brownies Mom made for Rachel's
 class bake sale tomorrow.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.579
My class doesn't need
a trip to Gettysburg

05:28.579 --> 05:30.621
as much as Mom
needs a purse.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.213
A cute suede purse
I'll use a bunch.

05:33.213 --> 05:36.837
I hate suede. It's like
leather's wimpy cousin.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.380
Like suede cares
what you think.
It doesn't.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.463
Now, we'll never make enough
money just selling brownies.

05:42.463 --> 05:43.964
It's all about the tips.

05:43.964 --> 05:47.267
So I'll look hot,
and you'll look adorable.

05:47.267 --> 05:48.389
Hot, adorable. Go.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.437
- I'm so sad.
- Daphne.

05:56.437 --> 06:00.280
I need money to buy
something special for my mommy.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.073
I love her very, very much.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:16.126 --> 06:19.339
And that's how it's done.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.712
Can you believe they're
using the money

06:21.712 --> 06:23.674
to buy Mom
some silly purse?

06:23.674 --> 06:27.508
Wait. They're buying Mom
that purse she visits

06:27.508 --> 06:28.719
every time we go
to the mall.

06:28.719 --> 06:30.811
The one she talks to
in the baby voice.

06:30.811 --> 06:32.933
Yeah, the one Security always
tells her to stop petting.

06:32.933 --> 06:35.105
She's got a total
purse crush on that thing.

06:35.105 --> 06:36.857
What's Ethan doing?

06:36.857 --> 06:38.899
Making Mom
a strawberry pie.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.321
He is?
 That's her favorite.

06:41.321 --> 06:43.734
Why didn't you want
 to be part of that?

06:43.734 --> 06:45.656
I have no problem
with the idea.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.367
I wasn't comfortable
standing guard

06:47.367 --> 06:49.950
while Ethan borrowed
Miss Peters' strawberries.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.912
Mmm.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.915
He's using berries stolen
from Miss Peters' yard?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.667
Mom can't stand her.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.749
It'll make that pie
much sweeter.

06:58.749 --> 07:01.251
And he's also making
organic ice cream to go on top.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.423
Not helping, Georgie.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.506
Can you not hear
the rising panic in my voice?

07:05.506 --> 07:07.808
Okay, yes, I do now.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.970
Don't worry. Lewie and Beast
are only planning

07:09.970 --> 07:11.431
to fix something of Mom's.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.104
Finally. A gift that's
worse than mine.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.727
Lewie and Beast
are great breakers, not fixers.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.399
They came up with
a pretty long list
of options.

07:19.399 --> 07:20.731
Things Mom says we broke.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.402
- Her mirror.
- Can't fix it.

07:22.402 --> 07:24.234
- Her lamp.
- Can't fix it.

07:24.234 --> 07:27.197
- Her spirit.
- She said we crushed
it, not broke it.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.909
Either way, can't fix it.

07:28.909 --> 07:31.532
Our Thanksgiving
gravy boat.

07:31.532 --> 07:32.743
That wasn't our fault.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.575
Don't call it a boat
if it doesn't float.

07:34.575 --> 07:36.076
But still, Mom loved it.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.539
And we love Mom.

07:38.539 --> 07:41.502
- And gravy.
- Gravy boat it is.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.584
Lewie and Beast are making
a handmade gift

07:43.584 --> 07:45.926
that's also
the Thanksgiving centerpiece?

07:45.926 --> 07:48.298
They're hitting
two holidays in one.

07:48.298 --> 07:50.010
Three. We also use it
at Christmas.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.892
Again, rising panic, Georgie.

07:51.892 --> 07:54.354
Can you not hear
the rising panic?

07:54.354 --> 07:57.768
Sorry, sorry. I'm not good
at taking the temperature
of a room.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.940
Don't panic.
Dad's gift is boring.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.942
Filling that pothole
in the driveway.

08:04.104 --> 08:08.158
Oh! Oh, come on!

08:08.158 --> 08:11.952
Mom's filled three swear jars
because of that pothole.

08:11.952 --> 08:15.075
Everyone's come up with a great
gift that's better than mine.

08:15.075 --> 08:18.579
You're upset so
I'm gonna remain quiet

08:18.579 --> 08:21.041
and not say anything
to make it worse, correct?

08:21.041 --> 08:23.674
Yes, I am upset,
Georgie. Very.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.676
Got it right. Yes! Finally.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.087
Georgie from downtown.

08:28.679 --> 08:30.681
And right back to
the wrong response.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.432
This sure is
a process.

08:32.432 --> 08:34.804
I can't believe this.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.097
The first year Mom really
knows who did what,

08:38.097 --> 08:39.900
my gift's the worst.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.192
- What did you make?
- I just show you with it.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.605
A 12-roll automatic
toilet paper changer.

08:44.605 --> 08:47.357
Toilet paper changer?
Awesome!

08:47.357 --> 08:49.990
That's personal
and memorable.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.783
Mom will think of us
every time she... Oh.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.419
Everyone else
totally nailed it.

08:59.419 --> 09:03.043
They have a Mother's Day gift
that will touch Mom's heart.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.965
Mine will touch her butt.

09:04.965 --> 09:07.087
You're letting everyone
psych you out.

09:07.087 --> 09:09.509
The toilet paper changer
thingy is a good idea.

09:09.509 --> 09:10.881
Ask anyone.

09:11.972 --> 09:15.225
A gift for the bathroom
for your mom.

09:15.225 --> 09:17.808
She calls it Dad's
home office, so probably not.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.023
The good news is we're ahead
on our Father's Day gift.

09:23.023 --> 09:26.647
Great. My toilet paper changer
has already hit the skids.

09:26.647 --> 09:28.949
- ( snickers )
- Yes, I heard it too.

09:28.949 --> 09:31.451
Not the time to laugh.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.453
It's too late to make
something else Mom will love.

09:33.453 --> 09:37.117
I can't believe I'm
lowering myself to this,

09:37.117 --> 09:40.661
but we're going to have
to resort to...

09:40.661 --> 09:42.542
a store-bought gift.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.705
Steer clear.

09:44.705 --> 09:47.547
Concrete needs to set.
It's your mom's gift.

09:47.547 --> 09:49.630
First Mother's Day,
diamond earrings.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.762
Fifteen years later,
pothole.

09:51.762 --> 09:53.343
At least she won't
lose this one down the drain.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.805
( horn honks )

09:57.557 --> 09:59.349
Hello, family.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.311
The supermarket was amazing.

10:01.311 --> 10:04.064
First time I didn't hear,
"Clean-up on aisle two,"

10:04.064 --> 10:06.066
followed by, "Suzy Diaz,
please claim your child

10:06.066 --> 10:07.648
in aisle two."

10:19.159 --> 10:21.662
Only three tries.
Today really is my day.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.044
Okay, off to watch
 "Heatherton Cottage.

10:24.044 --> 10:25.836
See you suckers tonight.

10:28.298 --> 10:30.510
Dad's right.

10:30.510 --> 10:34.094
The place a busy mom
spends her time isn't
the bathroom.

10:34.094 --> 10:36.216
It's a place even grosser
and smellier.

10:36.216 --> 10:37.848
The boys' room.

10:37.848 --> 10:39.639
The car, Georgie.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.142
We're going to get
this four-wheel garbage dump

10:42.142 --> 10:43.934
professionally cleaned
and detailed

10:43.934 --> 10:45.565
while she's watching
her show all day.

10:45.565 --> 10:47.768
Great idea.

10:47.768 --> 10:51.531
Plus we'll finally
give the car something
it's been begging for.

10:51.531 --> 10:53.734
I think I wrote that
three years ago.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.116
Anyway, I saw an ad
for a car detailer
we can afford.

10:56.116 --> 10:57.908
I'll go get his number.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.910
And I'll go empty
my Bob Costas piggy bank.

11:02.282 --> 11:04.745
We can use clay
to make our gravy boat.

11:04.745 --> 11:06.376
Where should we dig?

11:06.376 --> 11:08.288
For sure not near
our French fry garden.

11:08.288 --> 11:11.922
No duh. It's spring.
We'd lose our curly fry crop,

11:11.922 --> 11:14.214
Whoa.

11:17.848 --> 11:20.180
Driveway clay.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.302
Way better than
ground clay.

11:36.026 --> 11:40.120
I need bus money to visit
my mom in prison and...

11:41.121 --> 11:43.954
Oh. I'm not wasting
this cold on you.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.625
Our sale was huge.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.168
The purse will be
perfect for prom...

11:48.168 --> 11:51.711
if Mom gets asked.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.503
Wow, thoughtful.

11:53.503 --> 11:56.546
Maybe Mom can bake brownies
for that, too.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.722
Super cheap car detailing.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.684
Now you're talking
my price range.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.059
"Lewie and Beast
food tasting service.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.191
Will try any three foods
for a dollar.

12:11.191 --> 12:14.024
We eat it so you
don't have to."

12:14.024 --> 12:15.695
Five people took their number,

12:15.695 --> 12:17.487
but not a one for CPR training.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.859
What a world.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.492
We'll need it back
in an hour.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.788
Do what you can.
And yes, there is
a floor in there.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.209
Just keep digging.

12:32.422 --> 12:35.635
Okay, that gives us
an hour to make a card for Mom.

12:35.635 --> 12:38.218
A card with just
our names signed.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.180
We'll make sure it looks
absolutely perfect.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.142
In that case,
let's make two cards.

12:42.142 --> 12:43.683
One for safety.

12:43.683 --> 12:45.806
I've been known to botch
a signature.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.597
That's why I always
disappear when packages arrive.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.982
Daphne, come on.
We've got to get that purse.

12:53.984 --> 12:55.395
Change of plans.

12:55.395 --> 12:58.608
I used the money for
a much better present.

12:58.608 --> 12:59.659
Balloons?!

12:59.659 --> 13:02.112
Hey, first guess.
Good for you.

13:02.112 --> 13:05.115
Please tell me you did not
spend all of our money
on balloons.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.667
No, I also went out
on the pier

13:07.667 --> 13:09.619
and made it rain.

13:09.619 --> 13:13.253
Fishermen and seagulls
were fighting over twenties.

13:13.253 --> 13:15.125
It was awesome.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.877
That was you?

13:16.877 --> 13:18.508
I just saw that video.
It's already gone viral.

13:18.508 --> 13:21.131
Best 200 bucks
I ever spent.

13:21.131 --> 13:24.724
( sighs ) I guess Mom's
getting balloons for
Mother's Day.

13:24.724 --> 13:27.928
Hey, a quarter.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.893
( balloons popping )

13:37.317 --> 13:39.149
We could always
give her a video

13:39.149 --> 13:41.281
of a sailor
punching a seagull.

13:41.281 --> 13:43.113
And a quarter.

13:43.113 --> 13:46.326
So you want in on
my strawberry pie, huh?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.038
I guess I can
share the glory.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.756
I'm sure it tastes
better than it looks.

13:56.756 --> 13:58.298
If you're a dragon.

13:58.298 --> 14:00.921
I didn't think
it was possible,

14:00.921 --> 14:03.053
but this gift is a step down
from popped balloons.

14:03.053 --> 14:05.845
What do you want from me?
I got distracted by my phone.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.808
Some girl started a money riot
down by the marina.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.811
Great. So our only hope
is Beast and Lewie?

14:11.811 --> 14:13.853
Hey, they could surprise us.

14:17.107 --> 14:20.360
You cemented your hands
together?!

14:20.360 --> 14:23.323
Cementing your mouths closed
would be a gift.

14:23.323 --> 14:24.784
This is not.

14:24.784 --> 14:26.486
We were trying
to make a gravy boat.

14:26.486 --> 14:28.989
You stop for five minutes
to watch an ant parade

14:28.989 --> 14:30.830
and this is
what happens.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.792
You think it could
still hold gravy?

14:32.792 --> 14:35.956
I can stay like this
until Thanksgiving if you can.

14:40.300 --> 14:44.384
Georgie, where's the best place
to put this in the car?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.597
Bigger question--
where's the car?

14:50.310 --> 14:53.603
What? I told the guy
he could keep whatever's
in the car.

14:53.603 --> 14:56.396
He kept the whole car!

14:57.397 --> 14:59.279
Okay, we all talked,

14:59.279 --> 15:02.402
and decided we should
work together.
How can we help?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.324
Find Mom's stolen car.

15:04.324 --> 15:06.987
Wow. That went south fast.

15:11.331 --> 15:13.873
- You lost Mom's car? How?
It's not lost.
- It's stolen.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.627
No wonder he asked for
the money upfront.

15:17.627 --> 15:19.839
He needed it for
getaway gas.

15:19.839 --> 15:21.421
What were you thinking?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.754
Let's all calm down.
He seemed like a nice guy.

15:24.754 --> 15:26.806
There must be some
explanation.
We'll just call him.

15:26.806 --> 15:29.309
I don't have his number.
I threw away the tab.

15:29.309 --> 15:30.680
What company is he from?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.762
No company.
He was just a guy.

15:32.762 --> 15:34.854
- ( all groaning )
- Where'd you find him, Harley?

15:34.854 --> 15:37.267
He must have some
references, contacts.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.900
It's not like he's some
nobody off the bulletin board
at Dad's store.

15:42.272 --> 15:45.275
Are you insane?
Lewie and Beast
advertise there.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.656
I can't wait till
Thanksgiving.

15:46.656 --> 15:49.369
I've gotta itch
my butt now.

15:53.413 --> 15:56.997
Guys! This is a very important
episode.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.379
Lady Heatherton is about to
have tea with the vicar.

15:59.379 --> 16:01.381
That noise is ruining it.

16:01.381 --> 16:04.844
I really wish I could be
screaming this,

16:04.844 --> 16:06.886
but we gotta find
that number.

16:09.049 --> 16:12.352
The marina bulletin board.
What was I thinking?

16:13.933 --> 16:16.306
Don't feel bad, Harley.
We've gotten some

16:16.306 --> 16:18.438
valuable clients from
that bulletin board.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.360
I ate a two-year-old
chicken wing.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.194
Or a cake pop.
Either way, it needed ranch.

16:25.405 --> 16:26.816
This is not good.

16:26.816 --> 16:29.109
Our Mother's Day gifts
are bad.

16:29.109 --> 16:31.451
Getting the car stolen--
whole other level.

16:31.451 --> 16:34.414
My besties say
total rookie move,

16:34.414 --> 16:36.246
giving the keys
to a stranger.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.289
They also say this peach
lip gloss is really workin'.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.920
He looked respectable.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.173
No facial scars,
no snake tattoos,

16:43.173 --> 16:44.754
no ankle monitor.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.756
Anyone who wasn't with
his mother on Mother's Day

16:46.756 --> 16:48.178
could've easily stolen a car.

16:48.178 --> 16:50.130
How did we not see that?

16:50.130 --> 16:51.891
I found it!

16:51.891 --> 16:55.895
The candy apple Mom took
away from me last week.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.347
Should I eat this?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.482
I wouldn't.

17:02.482 --> 17:05.105
I'm trying to be supportive,
but we'll never find that car.

17:05.105 --> 17:06.356
This is a big problem.

17:06.356 --> 17:07.987
What part of that
was supportive?

17:07.987 --> 17:09.819
Don't blame her.
You're Inventor Girl.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.781
You should have
this covered.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.204
She's right.

17:14.204 --> 17:17.036
I am Inventor Girl.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.829
That's my super power,
and I need to invent a way

17:19.829 --> 17:23.623
to use my siblings' lame super
powers to solve this crime.

17:23.623 --> 17:26.336
Because together, we make
an unstoppable team.

17:28.508 --> 17:31.171
The one who lives on
 her devices.

17:31.171 --> 17:32.762
The Textinator.

17:35.225 --> 17:37.016
I put out an APB
for the car

17:37.016 --> 17:38.888
on every app on my phone.

17:38.888 --> 17:40.390
I also informed
Taylor Nation.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.021
The squad needs to know.

17:42.021 --> 17:43.603
( phone chimes )

17:43.603 --> 17:46.356
Harley's stupidity is trending.
Trending!

17:46.356 --> 17:48.988
The one who spends hours
 watching,

17:48.988 --> 17:51.241
mostly from the bench.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.532
The Observer.

17:52.532 --> 17:55.575
Perp was 5'10 and a quarter,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.497
mole shaped like
a crescent wrench on his neck,

17:57.497 --> 17:59.959
smelled like almonds.

17:59.959 --> 18:03.503
The one who doodled his way
 from an "A" to a "C"

18:03.503 --> 18:05.705
in every class.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.417
The Human Pencil.

18:08.968 --> 18:10.840
I don't care
what he smelled like.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.382
How beady were his eyes?

18:12.382 --> 18:13.633
The ones who "ring and run"

18:13.633 --> 18:16.426
every house
 in the neighborhood.

18:16.426 --> 18:17.767
The Ding-Dongs.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.269
( doorbell ringing )

18:19.269 --> 18:20.810
We just need to know
if you saw anything

18:20.810 --> 18:23.563
suspicious, Mrs. Davis.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.395
And if you wanna invite
us in for cookies,

18:25.395 --> 18:28.027
that's your business.

18:28.027 --> 18:30.190
The one who eats
 rotten apples,

18:30.190 --> 18:32.322
despite her brother's advice.

18:32.322 --> 18:34.864
The Dumpster Diva.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.828
I know. Even in my fantasies,
 she does her own thing.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.292
Last but not least,

18:42.292 --> 18:44.164
the one who masterminded
 the plan

18:44.164 --> 18:46.166
to get Mom's car back.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.418
Inventor Girl.

18:52.592 --> 18:54.304
Yes, America,

18:54.304 --> 18:56.556
the Diaz family had
 everything we needed

18:56.556 --> 18:59.259
to bring this car thief
 to justice.

18:59.259 --> 19:01.851
But mostly, we needed
 each other.

19:01.851 --> 19:03.683
'Cause like any
 superhero team,

19:03.683 --> 19:05.475
the whole of
 the Diaz family

19:05.475 --> 19:07.267
is greater than
 the sum of its parts.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.571
Nothing?

19:11.571 --> 19:16.115
All that, and we found out
nothing about Mom's car?

19:16.115 --> 19:18.868
Our gift for Mom is
going to be a police report.

19:18.868 --> 19:21.451
Hey, my car.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.545
I just looked out the window.

19:25.545 --> 19:27.707
What happened
to my car?

19:27.707 --> 19:29.839
Who is responsible
for this?

19:29.839 --> 19:31.881
( sighs )

19:31.881 --> 19:34.464
Mom, I...

19:34.464 --> 19:35.755
- I am.
- Me, too.

19:35.755 --> 19:38.558
So am I.

19:38.558 --> 19:39.469
Me as well.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.511
- Me, too.
- Yeah, I...

19:43.723 --> 19:45.515
You all did this?

19:48.067 --> 19:51.231
Thank you so much.
The car looks amazing.

20:03.743 --> 20:06.586
Can you believe this?

20:06.586 --> 20:09.539
It looks like
the day we bought it.

20:09.539 --> 20:12.752
Wait. Our car was 20 feet
from our house?

20:12.752 --> 20:14.924
How did we not see it?

20:14.924 --> 20:17.677
It's so clean, none of us
recognized it.

20:17.677 --> 20:19.138
The car's silver?

20:19.138 --> 20:22.011
I always thought it was
mud and bird poop color.

20:22.011 --> 20:24.344
It's usually parked
under a tree.

20:24.344 --> 20:26.225
That's probably why
the guy moved it.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.307
Oh!

20:27.307 --> 20:29.018
You've made me so happy.

20:29.018 --> 20:30.730
I feel like Lady Heatherton

20:30.730 --> 20:32.852
when Lord Greyweather
complimented her tea cakes.

20:32.852 --> 20:34.694
Hey, spoiler alert.

20:38.908 --> 20:42.822
Yeah, my siblings may jump
 on the Harley bandwagon

20:42.822 --> 20:44.704
when it's time to take
 the credit,

20:44.704 --> 20:47.246
but what really matters is,

20:47.246 --> 20:50.920
they stay right on when
 it's time to take the blame.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.173
And that's why
 they're my superheroes.

20:57.677 --> 21:00.089
Hey, Harley.

21:00.089 --> 21:02.762
Did they really help, or did you
do all the work like always,

21:02.762 --> 21:04.183
and they took the credit?

21:04.183 --> 21:05.805
You knew?

21:05.805 --> 21:07.977
Come on. No one but you

21:07.977 --> 21:10.560
is gonna make a cuckoo clock
that says Buenos Diaz.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.313
Actually, this year,
everyone helped.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.234
We make a good team.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.236
Thanks for always
thinking of me, Harls.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.747
This is your present?

21:27.747 --> 21:29.789
I swear, I filled
