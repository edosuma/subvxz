Oh! [slight chuckle]

00:57.348 --> 01:00.143
It smells like a truck stop diner in here.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.187
There's a spot at the counter, ma'am.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.105
Ah! Sorry, that seat's taken.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.857
By whom? [slight chuckle]

01:05.940 --> 01:06.858
Morning.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.153
Oh, Jack. I didn't know you were here.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.989
Oh, good.
Well, that explains Frankie's spread.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.407
Does it? I am only one man.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.700
[laughs]

01:17.619 --> 01:19.287
Oh, you are a hoot.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.955
Here. Now eat up.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.917
Oh, Jack. I'm sorry
that Hawaii fell apart.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.462
But when Nick gets back from the Caymans,
we should make a new plan.

01:27.545 --> 01:31.132
Sounds great. I'm just sorry Nick
couldn't join us for Frankie's birthday.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.677
Yeah, he's all torn up
that he missed laser tag and pizza.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.722
Uh-oh! All right, big guy, out you go.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.433
-[Jack] Shouldn't I leave the plate?
-[Frankie] No, it's recyclable.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.810
Oh. [chuckles]

01:41.893 --> 01:45.188
Have a good day at the office.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.108
-I'm still retired.
-[chuckles]

01:48.817 --> 01:52.529
[sighs] Jeez, some people just never know
when to say goodbye.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.865
So, I'm-I'm glad you and Jack
are doing so well,

01:55.949 --> 01:58.868
but you won't be
if you keep shoving him out the door.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.412
I mean, you should be
a little more considerate.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.373
I am considerate.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.668
I let him be Sulu last night
while I was Spock.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.795
I beg you not to tell me what that means.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.132
-We boldly go where no man has gone be--
-I begged you.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
-[door closes]
-Good morning.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.595
-Oh, there's my big guy.
-[slight chuckle]

02:17.679 --> 02:19.681
-Hey, big guy.
-[Frankie chuckles]

02:20.682 --> 02:22.559
Yeah, it didn't feel good for me, either.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.935
-Ready to roll?
-I am.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.396
Um... [clears throat]
As you know, Grace,

02:26.479 --> 02:30.984
I was sick with the 24-hour bird flu
on my birthday.

02:31.526 --> 02:35.572
So Jacob and I are celebrating today
by playing laser tag.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.825
You would not believe
how good this lady is at laser tag.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.702
Yeah, and at getting over bird flu.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.538
I'm sorry, could you give us a moment?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.748
Sure, I'll just take this outside.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.710
Maybe I can find a football team
on the beach to share it with.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.670
[laughs] You are a hoot!

02:51.129 --> 02:52.172
Out you go.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.093
What the hell is going on here?
I thought you picked Jack.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.556
Oh, Grace, I love that big, beautiful,
simple mind of yours.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.642
-[scoffs]
-But we are having the time of our lives,

03:04.726 --> 03:07.896
and so, I have decided not to choose.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.772
And it's working out perfectly.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.691
Do they know that?

03:12.901 --> 03:16.988
Well, I told them both in a dream,
so I'm sure on some level they know.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.615
So you're two-timing them.

03:18.698 --> 03:23.119
No, I am one-at-a-timing them,
simultaneously.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.871
This is not gonna end well.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.623
Who says it has to end?

03:26.706 --> 03:30.543
Why can't I just keep dating my J-Rock
and my, um...

03:30.919 --> 03:32.003
I want to say J-Bird.

03:32.086 --> 03:35.673
Yeah, that's why.
You could never keep anything straight.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.259
You've seen <i>Dog Day Afternoon </i>500 times

03:38.343 --> 03:40.720
and you still think the cop
is Jack Warden.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.973
-Oh, he is so terrifying in that film.
-It's Charles Durning.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.102
No, no, no, no.
Charles Durning is Brian Dennehy.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.563
-What?
-See, I have it all figured out.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.609
And frankly, who eats my bacon
is none of your business.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.445
[laughs]

04:01.074 --> 04:04.410
[Bud] These are from my drone race.
Came in third.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.372
They're kind of blurry
'cause I was going pretty fast. [chuckles]

04:07.455 --> 04:08.498
Incredible.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.791
Thanks, Dad.

04:09.874 --> 04:14.545
It's like she knew where it was supposed
to go and she put it almost exactly there.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.966
The doctor said her visuospatial skills
are off the charts.

04:18.049 --> 04:22.095
And this morning, I'm pretty sure
I heard her say "pomegranate."

04:22.178 --> 04:25.348
And I'm pretty sure she just took
a poo-poo in her pants.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.476
Because she's smart enough
not to hold it in.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.187
Who's our little genius?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.481
Last week our little genius
was trying to eat that puzzle,

04:33.564 --> 04:34.941
so let's not go crazy here.

04:35.024 --> 04:38.027
Mmm... Maybe she is a genius,
maybe she isn't.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.364
But until she's old enough to tell us,
we'll never know.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.075
Oh, God, are you starting this again?

04:44.158 --> 04:46.744
I'm not sending my saliva
to some DNA website.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.539
But what if her grandmother
was a great pianist,

04:49.622 --> 04:51.791
and we're wasting her talent
taking her to archery?

04:51.874 --> 04:53.543
[Bud] Who's taking her to archery?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.336
She can't even handle a fork.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.922
What about your side of the family, huh?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.925
Maybe all the geniuses come from there.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.178
Doubt it. All the smart ones
died in the Dust Bowl.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.639
I do understand
where Allison's coming from.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.557
[Allison] Hmm.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.643
When you were a kid, we were
constantly having to tell doctors,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.353
"We don't know, we don't know."

05:12.437 --> 05:13.938
And I turned out just fine.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
We don't know, we don't know.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.569
I know you don't want to know
about your biological family.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.446
But for Faith's sake?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.364
Yeah, maybe she was descended from Mozart.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.200
It doesn't matter
who you're descended from.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.329
Mozart wasn't descended from Mozart,
and he did pretty well.

05:29.412 --> 05:33.166
Here's a novel idea: how about
we just let the baby be a baby,

05:33.249 --> 05:34.876
and let the parents be parents,

05:34.959 --> 05:37.337
and somebody please change that diaper.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.005
-Your turn.
-Fine.

05:39.964 --> 05:43.384
I'm just gonna leave my drone video up,
if anyone wants to check it out.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.719
[Faith babbles]

05:44.802 --> 05:47.180
Quit talking over Faith!
I think she just said something.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.224
Yeah, she did. She said,
"You can't choose your family."

05:50.308 --> 05:51.559
Ignore him.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.645
Maybe in time, Bud will come around.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.107
Or maybe we'll have to go behind his back,

05:58.441 --> 06:00.651
swab some saliva from his mouth guard,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.987
and send it off to YourGeneMap-dot-com.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.405
You didn't.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.200
Six weeks ago.
The results should arrive any day now.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.243
Oh, you're good.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.328
I know.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.581
Bud still thinks we met "by chance."

06:13.664 --> 06:15.166
-[laughs]
-What?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.001
[Allison laughs]

06:18.002 --> 06:21.631
No, no, no, see, it's a toilet
that rises up automatically.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.509
Okay.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.011
You too.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.473
Let me guess, they said no.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.059
No. They said, "No, thank you."

06:33.643 --> 06:34.894
Which is progress.

06:35.144 --> 06:39.357
At this rate of progress, we'll hit
60 rejections by the end of today.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.901
Well, we could hit more
if you also made calls.

06:41.984 --> 06:45.696
I am too busy solving our problems
with two words:

06:46.030 --> 06:48.366
Desert Topaz.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.493
Casino.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.247
Desert Topaz Casino Resort and Spa.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.624
Two words: no.

06:56.707 --> 07:00.044
I am not getting lost on the way
to see Carrot Top with you again.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.379
If we hadn't gotten lost,

07:01.462 --> 07:04.924
we never would have run into Carrot Top
at that Ruby Tuesday.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.634
Oh, that wasn't Carrot Top!

07:06.717 --> 07:09.512
He had red hair and a trunk, who cares?

07:09.595 --> 07:13.891
I'm trying to tell you they're having
open auditions for <i>Shark Tank</i>

07:13.975 --> 07:17.019
at Desert Topaz this weekend.

07:17.311 --> 07:21.983
You want me to go to a cattle call
for a reality show? [chuckles] Pass!

07:22.316 --> 07:24.569
-We would kill on that show!
-[sighs]

07:24.652 --> 07:26.487
I'm very telegenic.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.240
-And you'd be there, too.
-[knocking]

07:30.533 --> 07:32.952
Sorry. Sorry, I know you're working.

07:33.035 --> 07:36.456
I've just got to get some info on that
artwork Nick wants to sell at Christie's.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.332
I am actually really happy you're here.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.128
Would you please explain to Frankie
why we shouldn't go on a reality show?

07:42.211 --> 07:45.339
Uh, because Nick's wife number three
was on <i>Real Housewives?</i>

07:45.715 --> 07:48.259
-She was?
-Only for two episodes.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.511
She got a DUI, which got her a spin-off.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.097
Oh, Danielle.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.349
She tried to cut off her ankle monitor.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.478
And that's the kind of person
who goes on reality television.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.481
But not the kind of person
who goes on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

08:01.564 --> 08:02.815
[Miriam] <i>Shark Tank?</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:04.650
Ooh.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.111
That's not a bad idea, actually.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.654
You're not serious.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.699
Well, even if you don't get funding,
you get great exposure.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.867
Exactly.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.994
I started two businesses, okay?

08:15.077 --> 08:17.872
I shouldn't have to audition
with a bunch of amateurs.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.209
They have entrepreneurs of all levels
with some great products.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.169
That's how we snagged the Mop-A-Doodle.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.921
What does the Mop-A-Doodle do?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.089
[laughs] I sound like a rooster.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.010
It takes the dirt on your floor
and it makes it into floor art.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.429
Why would anyone buy one of those?

08:33.513 --> 08:34.680
Beats me.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.060
-How many do you have?
-Three.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.897
I've got Mop-A-Doodle Lite,
Mop-A-Doodle Pro, and Mop-A-Doodle Don't.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.857
[cell phone rings]

08:46.067 --> 08:48.236
-[continues ringing]
-Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.530
It's an investor,
and he's calling us back.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.407
Okay, Grace, it's do-or-die.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.618
It's this guy or <i>Shark Tank.</i>

08:55.993 --> 08:57.703
I did not agree to that.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.875
Hello, Mr. Swanson,
I'm so glad to hear from you.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.710
Yeah, uh, it's...

09:04.794 --> 09:05.628
Oh.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.213
Okay.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.466
Well, toilets are about to have
a big moment,

09:10.550 --> 09:13.219
and I'm so sorry you won't be part of it.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.181
-[exhales]
-Okay, Grace, you win.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.267
<i>Shark Tank </i>it is.

09:23.854 --> 09:28.776
"To go wrong in one's own way is better
than to go right in someone else's."

09:29.485 --> 09:31.862
[Faith coos]

09:31.946 --> 09:33.698
I think she's getting it.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.032
Well, if she is getting it,

09:35.116 --> 09:38.494
then maybe you shouldn't be reading
her a book about murder.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.247
I was halfway to my dermatologist's
when Bud's DNA results came in,

09:41.330 --> 09:44.500
and I thought, "This carbuncle can wait.
I got to get to Sol."

09:44.584 --> 09:46.294
-[all chuckle]
-Hi, my baby.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.380
-Aww.
-Well, let's see what it says.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.757
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

09:51.841 --> 09:53.843
You realize, if you both look together,

09:53.926 --> 09:56.345
it doesn't make either of you
any less guilty.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.891
If we're guilty of anything,
it is of caring about Faith's future.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.478
And I think it does make us
a little less guilty.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.399
Okay, under genetic traits,
it says that Bud

10:08.482 --> 10:11.777
may be prone to lactose intolerance
and heavy earwax.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.529
How much did that test cost?

10:13.613 --> 10:18.034
Oh, my God! He may also have
Olympic-level athletic ability?

10:18.326 --> 10:21.454
Frankie always wanted to put him
on a curling team,

10:21.537 --> 10:23.164
but I said no.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.790
If I'd only known.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.294
We could be sitting pretty now,
living off his curling endorsements.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.755
Where does it say
if Bud's related to a genius

10:30.838 --> 10:32.923
or descended from anyone famous?

10:33.007 --> 10:37.595
Oh, I think you have to click
"Share and Find Out More" to see.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.930
Should we "Share and Find Out More"?

10:40.014 --> 10:42.016
-I don't see why not.
-[Robert] Really?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.268
You don't see why not?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.021
You share Bud's info and then what?

10:47.104 --> 10:49.565
You reach out to a family member
behind his back?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.986
What? Don't be crazy.
We're not contacting anyone.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.740
What we're doing is totally innocent.
It's called cyber-stalking.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.242
You shut me up.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.662
So? Should we do it?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.538
Let's do it.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.709
[exhales]

11:09.627 --> 11:12.380
-[computer dings]
-Oh, my God. There's a match!

Of course there is.

-[Faith babbles]

11:15.883 --> 11:18.302
Hello, Sharks, I'm Frankie Bergstein.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.680
Hello, no one, I'm Grace Hanson.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.307
-And this is a--
-Waste of time.

11:24.350 --> 11:29.271
Hey, your way has not worked.
Now cut the sass, toots, and get to it.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.314
Fine.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.193
Did you know that there are
40,000 toilet injuries

11:34.276 --> 11:37.154
each year
across the contiguous United States?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.699
Imagine what that count would be

11:39.782 --> 11:43.160
if we included Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.370
[Miriam] I'm out.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.038
Excuse me?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.749
I'm sorry.
That's just what the Sharks say.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.543
Look, business lady,

11:50.626 --> 11:53.879
if you have suggestions for our pitch,
speak up.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.507
Yeah. Or if... if you don't think
we should do it at all,

11:56.590 --> 11:57.925
feel free to say that, too.

11:58.008 --> 12:01.595
Okay. It was god-awful
and bored me to tears.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.599
She's playing hardball, Grace.
This is great.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.017
How is this great?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.270
We have our very own Shark.

12:11.313 --> 12:16.026
With our aging population, more seniors
are at risk of injury in the bathroom.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.487
Or worse, death by toilet.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.697

[exhales] She's tough.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.299
Well, you know, we gave it
our best skiddily-bee-bop try.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.386
Maybe we're just not cut out
for <i>Shark Tank.</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:44.430
Why won't you make us an offer, damn it?

12:45.014 --> 12:47.933
Because you're not giving me
a compelling reason to.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.977
The Sharks aren't just investing
in a product.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.271
They're investing in a story.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.858
What is your story? How'd you
come up with the idea for this?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.194
Well, we have a great story.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.738
Uh, it's a great private story.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.324
Yes, Grace got stuck on the can big-time.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.034
Well, there goes the private part.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.037
Wait, hold it.
You got stuck on the toilet?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.080
Please keep that between us.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.541
She was all alone. It was pretty dire.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.710
And then we realized,
if it happened to me,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.670
it's probably happening
to a lot of other people.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.632
So we created this thing
to help all those people.

13:20.382 --> 13:24.220
That's fantastic. All you have to do
is tell that story on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

13:24.595 --> 13:26.263
-Ah.
-I'm out.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.435
There are hundreds of Jordan Scotts
on Facebook.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.687
How are we supposed to know
which one is his cousin?

13:33.771 --> 13:37.358
[sighs] We go through each one
till we find whoever is most Bud-like.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.527
Just look for the guy
who irons his T-shirts.

13:39.902 --> 13:44.281
What about this guy?
He likes food porn and... porn-porn.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.575
No, porn-porn makes Bud cry.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.913
Oh, this Jordan Scott hurt himself
pretty bad on a Razor scooter.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.540
Doesn't mean he isn't a genius.

13:52.623 --> 13:56.460
You don't feel bad
about stealing your son's bodily fluids

13:56.544 --> 13:58.337
and then stalking his cousin?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.965
-I would feel guilty if I didn't do it.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.466
-[Allison] Oh, no.
-What?

14:02.550 --> 14:05.302
It's Jordan Scott.
Oh, God. He sent us a message.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.138
-How can he do that?
-Well, if we can see him, he can see us!

14:08.222 --> 14:09.557
That doesn't seem right.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.642
Oh, God. He wants to meet us.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.603
He doesn't want to meet you.
He wants to meet Bud.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.481
-I told you this would happen.
-You didn't tell me this would happen!

14:17.565 --> 14:20.359
If you had told me <i>this</i> would happen,
I wouldn't have done it!

14:20.442 --> 14:22.653
Well, I don't know how the Internet works.

14:22.736 --> 14:23.821
Neither do I.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.991
We were very wrong to do this.

I'm not angry with Grace!

14:44.925 --> 14:46.218
Huh?

14:46.302 --> 14:49.972
All right, you've pulled it out of me.
I'm very angry with Grace.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.390
Should I pull some more out of you?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.641
[exhales]

14:52.725 --> 14:54.143
All right, I'll bite.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.395
Grace is bailing on me.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.481
She's closing the lid on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:04.028
Well, when God closes one lid,
she opens another one.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.947
Thank you, Jack.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.034
That was very insightful.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.911
I learned a lot in the bin.

15:12.786 --> 15:16.206
-Oh, I-I was still painting that.

-Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
-[continues ringing]

15:24.506 --> 15:25.799
Perhaps I do.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.178
Hmm.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.763
[exhales] I'll be right back.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.307
I just remembered I got to go,
be back in a second.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.144
-Okay.
-[door closes]

15:42.775 --> 15:47.112
-There she is.
-And she is confused that here he is.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.574
-What are you doing here?
-I was at the farmer's market,

15:50.658 --> 15:52.785
and I saw these beautiful cheeses.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.454
Cheese picnic. Great idea.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.040
You go set up on the patio.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.460
And I'll come out with the candy corn
as soon as I finish my painting.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.963
-I'd love to see what you're working on.
-No!

16:04.046 --> 16:08.926
Uh, I mean, it's kind of a surprise.
For-For me.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.762
And I'd hate for you
to tell me what it is.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.098
I almost understand that.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.225
Okay, I'll meet you outside.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.685
Ah, great.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.064

into my cheese-eating pants.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.707
Oh, no, no. This is a really nice bottle.

16:40.332 --> 16:44.003
You know, a famous
yet controversial sommelier once told me

16:44.086 --> 16:47.923
the best way to enjoy a red
is to speed-drink it.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.174
Really?

17:01.145 --> 17:01.979
[exhales]

17:03.355 --> 17:05.441
What are you, a narc? Drink it.

[Frankie] Mm.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.070
-[exhales]
-[grunts]

17:10.154 --> 17:12.072
I can't say I agree with that sommelier.

[groans] Well, I'm beat.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.493

17:17.411 --> 17:19.788
I think it's time for me to take a nap.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.708
Oh, a nap for two sounds perfect.
[chuckles]

17:22.791 --> 17:26.045
Um, all right.
Well, why don't you get started,

17:26.378 --> 17:29.840
and I will go change
into my napping pants.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.938
Hey.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.150
Oh, no, thanks, I've got
a pretty good buzz going already.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.234
But I just opened it.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.696
Oh, well, you've got
some catching up to do, fella.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.991
You know, I've really missed
little moments like this.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.701
-Mm-hmm.
-Just you and me,

17:57.785 --> 17:59.787
good food, gorgeous view.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.415
[exhales] I have, too.
I could sit here all day.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.127
Or for the length
of one adult male's REM cycle.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.422
-I love the way your mind works.
-[chuckles]

18:10.506 --> 18:12.549

What are we gonna do?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.815
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.984
What you're going to do is tell Bud. Now.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.611
-[exhales]
-But he's not here.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.365
So I guess we just take this
to our graves?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.033
He's going to find out anyway.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.702
Don't you think Jordan Scott's
gonna track Bud down?

18:40.786 --> 18:44.164
Maybe not. He's still dealing
with that terrible scooter accident.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.583
But he already has
all of Bud's information.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.001
All he has is a name.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.379
And that name is Nwabudike Bergstein.

18:50.462 --> 18:54.508
How many of them do you think
live here in San Diego? Or anywhere?

18:54.591 --> 18:57.136
Well, if there were even two,
it could buy us some time.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.514
You have to tell Bud
before Jordan Scott does.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.349
[exhales]

19:03.684 --> 19:06.728
You both know what to do.
I wash my hands of this.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.065
Now that I've washed my hands,
I'm going to make a sandwich.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.609
He's right.

19:12.901 --> 19:16.029
But we should lead
with that Olympic athlete thing.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.033
-What the hell is going on here?
-Um...

19:20.367 --> 19:21.827
Jack, hey.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.621
Look who showed up for a surprise picnic.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.707
And no one knew he was coming.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.125
Why are you wearing Frankie's robe?

19:28.208 --> 19:31.211
-Why are you feeding her cheese?
-I don't know. She likes cheese?

19:31.295 --> 19:34.756
Okay, guys, the good news is
it's all out in the open now,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.967
and I know I feel relieved.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.636
-Frankie, how could you do this to me?
-And me.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.725
Are you two really upset, or is this
just society telling you to be upset?

19:45.058 --> 19:46.310
No. I'm really upset.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.562
And I'm wearing a ladies' rainbow robe.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.856
That robe is gender neutral.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.067
Frankie, what did you think
was going to happen here?

19:55.319 --> 19:58.780
I don't know, but we were
all having so much fun.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.617
But we didn't know
that "we" were having fun.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.703
W-We thought "we" were having fun.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.750
And I can't do "we."

20:10.125 --> 20:11.418
Wait, J-Rock--

20:11.501 --> 20:15.047
I'm J-Rock! Because I worked
in the music biz, remember?

20:15.130 --> 20:18.175
No, I'm J-Rock.
'Cause I'm solid as a rock.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.760
Well, who is J-Bird?

20:19.843 --> 20:22.512
I can only assume
it's another guy you're stringing along.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.226
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have been honest
with both of you.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.521
But Jack, I didn't expect
to fall for you so fast.

20:32.397 --> 20:36.276
And Jacob, I didn't know I was gonna feel
so much when you showed up.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.070
[groans] Oh, the hives are back.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.155
This goddamn patio!

20:40.239 --> 20:43.116
You know, I probably should have left
when I knew you weren't dying,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.035
but I definitely should leave now.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.745
-No! Don't go!
-Well, then I'll go.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.039
No! Nobody move.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.959
I have feelings for both of you.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.921
But you don't feel enough for either of us
to want to give up the other,

20:56.004 --> 20:57.756
and that's not going to work for me.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.716
Yes, but aren't you both flattered

20:59.800 --> 21:03.512
that I'm messing up my relationship
with one of you for the other?

21:03.595 --> 21:04.972
Well, which one's which?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.645
-[exhales]
-I guess that's our answer.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.983
Wanna go grab a drink?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.109
No.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.742
Hi, I'm Grace Hanson.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.580
[scoffs] Well, you don't even know
what I'm going to say. I--

21:32.124 --> 21:33.750
Yes, it is about a toilet.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.921
-Okay, goodbye.
-[clattering]

21:40.465 --> 21:43.343
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's happening? Where is that going?

21:43.427 --> 21:45.178
Uruguay. This one's already sold.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.306
No, but that-that one has to stay here.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.599
I'm sorry, Nick thought
you didn't like it

21:49.683 --> 21:51.727
since you had it moved into the bathroom.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.481
Because the bathroom is the perfect place
to appreciate a statue.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.775
I mean, you're just sitting there.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.987
Right. It's a shame all those dummies
who made sculpture gardens

22:02.070 --> 22:03.280
didn't think of that.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.617
It helps me get off the toilet, okay?

22:08.660 --> 22:13.373
I throw a towel over her neck
and hoist myself up with it.

22:13.915 --> 22:19.338
Oh, gee, if only there were a product
to help someone with that.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.673
Sarcasm noted.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.885
So I take it Nick doesn't know
why you invented this toilet?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.970
No, no, he thinks Frankie
came up with this

22:27.054 --> 22:29.556
so she could reach
her bathroom Fig Newmans.

22:29.639 --> 22:30.682
I'm not gonna ask.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.352
Well, see, that's the beauty
of that story.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.729
Well, now I get why you don't want
to go on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:37.939
Yeah. Hey, listen,
you were married to the guy.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.402
How do you think Nick would react to me
telling him why we really started this?

22:42.819 --> 22:43.653
[exhales]

22:43.737 --> 22:47.366
I get it. It's not something anybody
wants to tell a new husband.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.701
And if this were the Nick
that I was married to,

22:49.785 --> 22:53.038
I would say 100 percent do not tell him.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.416
But he's a different guy now,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.211
and he really loves you.

22:59.294 --> 23:03.799
Yeah, I know he does.
But once that image is in his head...

23:03.882 --> 23:06.301
Well, I think we can both agree
intimacy is gross.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.637
But if that's what
you really want with Nick...

23:08.720 --> 23:11.139
No, what I want is to keep that statue.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.893
Yeah. Unfortunately, so does
the president of Uruguay.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.019
Sorry.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.479
-[exhales]
-[Miriam] Oh.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.691
Just out of curiosity,
how did you manage

23:21.775 --> 23:24.194
before you moved the statue
into the bathroom?

23:24.486 --> 23:25.654
I had Frankie.

23:26.488 --> 23:29.991
She busted in like one
of those Kool-Aid men and rescued me.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.702
I'd probably still be there
if it wasn't for her.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.663
You would if you called me.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.083
You're lucky. Frankie's a good one.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.877
Yes, she is.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.676
So let me get this straight.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.470
You went behind my back and stole my DNA?

23:50.554 --> 23:52.347
Our curiosity got the better of us.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.808
We just wanted to help Faith cure cancer.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.935
Do you hear how insane that sounds?

23:57.018 --> 24:00.605
-I'm so sorry.
-On the upside, you do have Olympic genes.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.900
Damn it. I knew
I would've been good at curling.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.610
You see how dangerous this is?

24:05.694 --> 24:08.280
Now I'm going to be thinking
about my dashed curling dreams all night.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.241
[groans] We've done a terrible thing.
What can we do to fix this?

24:11.324 --> 24:13.952
Just shut down the account.
I don't want to know anything else,

24:14.035 --> 24:15.871
and I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.747
We totally respect that, but--

24:17.831 --> 24:20.667
No. I don't want to hear it.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.502
I'm sorry, but you have to.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.672
No, I don't have to.
You're not my real dad.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.467
Bud, you have a real cousin,
and he wants to meet you.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.643
[door opens]

24:39.603 --> 24:40.520
[door closes]

24:41.563 --> 24:42.898
Frankie, are you all right?

24:43.690 --> 24:47.694
Oh, God, another China Bucket coma.

24:47.777 --> 24:51.865
I told you last time not to eat
the whole Great Wall of Wontons.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.201
You were right. It did not end well.

24:54.659 --> 24:58.455
Not the wontons, not dating both guys.
The whole thing just blew up.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.291
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-[groans]

25:01.625 --> 25:04.753
I was double-timing,
and I was double-dumped.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.506
So now I'm eating double dumplings.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.425
Yeah, well, that's the trajectory.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.178
-I guess.
-Yeah.

25:15.180 --> 25:19.351
I wanted everything to be light and fun.
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.062
Eventually, somebody always wants more.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.856
Surprisingly, it wasn't me.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.361
Why are you eating your feelings?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.616
Nick sold my bathroom statue.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.160
Okay, we can deal with that.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.371
Every time you need to go, just call me.

25:39.454 --> 25:42.958
I can be there in ten minutes,
give or take a few traffic laws.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.376
That's not gonna work.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.754
Right. So we'll live-stream
your bathroom to my phone.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.423
-So as soon as you walk in--
-Frankie.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.219
Okay, let's go over there right now
and rig up something else.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.179
I can figure it out, don't you worry.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.557
You would do that, wouldn't you?

25:58.932 --> 26:02.143
-Do what?
-Just drop everything for me.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.728
[laughs]

26:03.812 --> 26:05.272
What other solution is there?

26:07.691 --> 26:08.984
There's only one.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.112
-We gotta go.
-Where?

26:12.195 --> 26:14.197
To Desert Topaz.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.324
We're gonna tell our story.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.494
You know, if we do this,
Nick is gonna find out.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.870
Well, I'm well aware of that.

26:20.954 --> 26:25.458
But I'm not doing this business with Nick.
I'm doing it with my best friend.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.876
Yeah, you are!

26:27.460 --> 26:29.170
Let's go catch us a shark.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.548
-Let's do it.
-Yeah. [laughs]
