WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.915
CAMERON: Welcome.

00:02.959 --> 00:05.962
Most of you know me
as Acting Vice Principal Tucker,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.224
but today...

00:07.268 --> 00:11.098
I am your guide
to the future.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.708
The future...the future.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.450
Okay, so you didn't
take my note on the echo.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.104
Mitchell, I can't take another
negative voice in my head.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.497
I'm already freaking out
about Principal Brown.

00:19.541 --> 00:22.109
I kind of have a bully
at school.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.894
You gonna eat all that?

00:24.937 --> 00:27.723
-I-I guess not.
-PRINCIPAL BROWN: Okay.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.116
Saw your plans
for the seminar tomorrow.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.508
Oh, you like it?

00:30.552 --> 00:32.119
Y-You know, I think the kids
will really benefit

00:32.162 --> 00:33.337
from hearing
from four graduates

00:33.381 --> 00:35.296
that have taken
such different paths.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.733
I've got traditional college,
gap year --

00:37.776 --> 00:39.169
PRINCIPAL BROWN: Wrong!

00:39.213 --> 00:40.910
We're pushing onepath here --
college.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.781
Well, yeah, but college
isn't necessarily

00:42.825 --> 00:44.435
the right path
for every--

00:44.479 --> 00:46.568
Tucker, are you familiar
with the term "Golden Apple"?

00:46.611 --> 00:47.569
I am.

00:47.612 --> 00:48.570
I'm a little surprised

00:48.613 --> 00:50.093
it's made its way into
the straight vernacular.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.921
It's still illegal
in Alabama.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.575
No, no, no, Golden Apple status
is awarded to schools

00:53.618 --> 00:56.143
that reach a minimum
of 60% college acceptance.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.144
If we dip below that,

00:57.187 --> 00:58.971
I'm back to teaching
night school.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.451
If you think
the lunch ladies are mean,

01:00.495 --> 01:02.932
you should meet
the dinnerladies.

01:02.975 --> 01:03.976
Yeah, but what about
the students that --

01:04.020 --> 01:05.761
Play ball,
Acting Vice Principal Tucker,

01:05.804 --> 01:07.328
and you might
just find yourself --

01:07.371 --> 01:08.329
Vice principal?

01:08.372 --> 01:10.766
Mm-hmm.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.507
I just don't know
if I can preach something

01:12.550 --> 01:14.378
that I don't believe.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.553
-Ha! Play ball.
-Seems like a thing

01:15.597 --> 01:17.338
no one was saying,
and now everyone is.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.339
You know
what I'm doing right now?

01:18.382 --> 01:19.905
I'm making 100 cupcakes

01:19.949 --> 01:23.126
because the D.A. lost
his caterer for his kid's party

01:23.170 --> 01:24.475
and asked
if I could help out.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.956
But if it puts me, uh,
higher up on his radar,

01:26.999 --> 01:29.263
then so be it.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.394
I'm just saying

01:30.438 --> 01:32.962
sometimes you need to compromise
to -- to get ahead.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.572
Maybe it's ourtime now.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.008
Ooh, I like that.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.445
Hey, world,

01:37.488 --> 01:38.707
there's a newpower couple
on the horizon.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.361
-Yeah.
-Cam and Mitch.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.536
Citch --

01:41.579 --> 01:43.407
-No.
-No, that sounds weird.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.843
-Mam --
-We'll find it.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.339
Hey, Dad, our video conference
is about to start.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.340
Can we make it fast?

02:03.384 --> 02:04.733
I have that sales meeting
offsite.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.344
Hence the power threads
and box of cigars.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.259
Whoa!
Dad, it's 10:00 in the morning.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.391
-Mm.
-CLAIRE: Ohh!

02:10.434 --> 02:11.827
I don't swallow it.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.003
He smells it on my breath,
he lets his guard down.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.613
In 20 minutes,
I'm taking him in a way

02:15.657 --> 02:17.180
that would make
a prison guard blush.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.181
CLAIRE:

02:18.225 --> 02:19.704
It's the way
gentlemen do business.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.359
Well, I am sorry to ruin
your Glengarry, Glenlivet fun,

02:22.403 --> 02:24.231
but that meeting
got canceled.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.189
What?
I was looking forward to it.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.451
Nick took care of it
by Skype this morning.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.584
Log on.
Our meeting's about to start.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.024
-Okay, let's begin.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.504
So, Nick, where are we

02:36.547 --> 02:38.245
with the interactive closet
with the voice prompts?

02:38.288 --> 02:39.811
NICK: Here's a demo.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.987
Went with a Christopher Walken
soundalike voice.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.425
VOICE :
Forecast is...chilly.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.253
Put...on some pants.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.819
NICK: I think we all
fell in love with the idea

02:47.863 --> 02:49.647
of calling it aWalken closet,

02:49.691 --> 02:51.432
but this just isn't working.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.435
Hey, Claire, I don't see your
dad on the video conference.

02:54.478 --> 02:57.307
Damn it!
My computer's busted again.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.048
Or your caps lock is on.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.442
JAY: Can't we have this meeting
in the conference room?

03:01.485 --> 03:03.139
You know, where we all
sit around a table,

03:03.183 --> 03:04.793
there's a nice
breakfast spread?

03:04.836 --> 03:07.622
I am tired of having to keep
cream cheese in my desk.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.014
Dad, you know why
we do it this way.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.016
We have people
working here.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.017
We've got people
working from home.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.324
We've got people working
all over the world.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.239
Tiffany is in Berlin
at KlausetSchvarg.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.241
They still have
that conference?

03:18.285 --> 03:19.851
I thought they shut that down
in the '80s

03:19.895 --> 03:22.332
after we used that sweater hutch
to smuggle that dissident out

03:22.376 --> 03:23.464
during East KlausetSchvarg.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.423
You're good.
Just talk into the camera.

03:28.164 --> 03:30.035
Hoo! Sorry about that.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.515
NICK: All right.

03:31.559 --> 03:32.647
How about an update
on our 3-D printing?

03:32.690 --> 03:34.475
I think
everybody knows Eduardo.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.476
Jay,
have you two met?

03:35.519 --> 03:37.129
JAY:
I can't see the camera!

03:37.173 --> 03:38.522
Dad, you're, uh...

03:38.566 --> 03:40.307
you're kind of smushed up
against it.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.308
You might want to

03:41.351 --> 03:43.397
just step back a skosh.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.400
Using a 3-D printer
to manufacture our closets

03:46.443 --> 03:47.749
will triple revenue.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.141
I can't hear you!

03:49.185 --> 03:52.319
Volume up, Dad.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.668
NICK:
In our first year alone --

03:53.711 --> 03:55.844
What the hell?!

03:55.887 --> 03:56.845
Dad, "undo." Just --

03:56.888 --> 03:58.455
JAY: I know! I know!

03:58.499 --> 04:00.544
Double-click.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.764
GLORIA: ♪ Happy birrrthday

04:02.807 --> 04:03.765

04:03.808 --> 04:05.157
-CLAIRE: No!
-JAY: No!

04:05.201 --> 04:07.638
Have your stupid meeting!
I'm outta here!

04:07.682 --> 04:11.338
Margaret, I'm going to the park
across the street.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.295
-I need a walk!

04:12.339 --> 04:14.079
JAY: Aah!

04:14.123 --> 04:18.083
Thank you so much
for helping out with Joe.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.433
You don't think
it's too flashy?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.696
What are you talking about?
You're taking a magic class.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.437
You want to show them
you're serious.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.309
It's abracadabra,
not abraca-drab-ra.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.310
GLORIA:

04:27.354 --> 04:30.400
Look at that!
An open casting call.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.490
Excuse me,
what is this for?

04:33.534 --> 04:34.883
We are looking for
real families

04:34.926 --> 04:36.972
to be the new faces
of the Glen Valley Mall.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.887
You guys are adorable.
Want to sign up?

04:38.930 --> 04:39.888
Oh, we're not
a-a real --

04:39.931 --> 04:41.585
Oh, we would loveto!

04:41.629 --> 04:45.154
What a cool and a spontaneous
thing to do!

04:45.197 --> 04:47.156
I saw that poster last week.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.463
It kind of reminded me
of a long time ago

04:49.506 --> 04:51.552
when I used to do
a little modeling.

04:51.595 --> 04:52.988
I guess I miss it.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.946
I tricked Phil
into going to the mall

04:54.990 --> 04:57.471
because I knew that Jay
wouldn't do it with me.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.212
Oh, come on, guys.
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.649
I don't know.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.825
This kid in my class
did a cough syrup commercial.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.001
Now he's always going
to the teachers' lounge

05:06.044 --> 05:07.394
to call his manager.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.482
He's the worst.

05:08.525 --> 05:11.049
And I teach
a real-estate class at 5:00.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.268
I have to show up early
to limber up.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.878
Um...

05:13.922 --> 05:16.620
I think that this could help
a lot with Joe's self-esteem.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.579
He's had a rough week.

05:18.622 --> 05:21.930
You know how they treat kids
that are into magic.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.497
Oh, you tell him
when he gets to high school,

05:23.540 --> 05:24.585
that all changes.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.848
I don't like lying to him.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.197
Look, this isn't really
my thing,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.807
and I'm -- I'm feeling
a little under the weather.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.592
Don't -- Don't I look
a little pale?

05:31.635 --> 05:33.245
We will do it!

05:33.289 --> 05:34.899
Great.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.032
Our P.A. will set you up with
wardrobe for some test shots.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.773
Hey, team.
Can I get you anything?

05:38.816 --> 05:41.645
Uh, coffee? Water?
Still or sparkling?

05:41.689 --> 05:42.777
Ooh, I-I'd take
a sparkling.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.648
Talent wants sparkling.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.041
Did you hear that, Phil?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.869
-They call us talent!

05:47.912 --> 05:49.566
Let's not get carried away.
We're still reg--

05:49.610 --> 05:52.439
I said sparkling.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.746
Well, looks like
you're gonna get

05:55.790 --> 05:57.531
a pretty solid turnout,
Tucker.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.010
Now close the deal.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.056
Hey, what is,
uh, "whanex"?

06:01.099 --> 06:03.406
It's the way the kids say
"What's next?"

06:03.450 --> 06:04.538
If you want to reach them,

06:04.581 --> 06:06.409
you have to learn
to speak their language.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
Massive screw-up
at the print shop.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.500
I-I have no idea
how it happened!

06:10.544 --> 06:11.980
Yeah, that's right.
The banner should read...

06:12.023 --> 06:13.111
"whanex."

06:13.155 --> 06:16.419
Okay. Yeah, "whanex." Uh-huh.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.857
Welcome, students, to the first
annual "whanex" seminar.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.556
Let's, uh, just jump right
into it and meet our panelists.

06:22.599 --> 06:26.255
We have two bright, young people
who chose the college path

06:26.298 --> 06:27.561
and two wayward souls

06:27.604 --> 06:29.476
whose mistakes
we can only hope to learn from.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.478
'Sup, Dolphins?

06:37.527 --> 06:40.312
Nick, I'm so sorry
about my dad this morning.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.313
-Hi.
-Please forget it.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.098
-We've got a bigger problem.
-Hmm?

06:43.141 --> 06:45.709
We have to find a new voice for
the virtual closet assistant.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.929
We're thinking...female.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.670
Yeah, I was wondering
about that myself.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.062
MIA:
Hold on a second.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.152
Claire has a great voice --
commanding but alluring.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.719
Oh, come on.
I don't know about...

06:55.763 --> 06:56.851
...alluring.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.939
You're right.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.462
You're right.
I can totally hear it.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.637
Guys, guys...

07:00.681 --> 07:02.639
...you're embarrassing me.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.467
Where have you
been hiding this?

07:04.511 --> 07:05.599
Within half an hour,

07:05.642 --> 07:06.904
I had recorded
all the voice prompts

07:06.948 --> 07:08.297
for the new smart-closet,

07:08.340 --> 07:09.298
and they installed it

07:09.341 --> 07:10.865
in the prototype
right in the office.

07:10.908 --> 07:14.390
Everyone seemed really happy,
but I don't get it.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.522
I mean...

07:15.565 --> 07:17.785
...a voice is just a voice.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.832
CLAIRE : Oh, good.
Dad, you're back.

07:21.876 --> 07:25.967
Please step into our new
smart-closet prototype.

07:26.010 --> 07:26.968
So you can yell at me

07:27.011 --> 07:28.404
for bailing on the meeting
this morning?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.710
Just -- You'll see.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.539
Oh.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.975
VIRTUAL CLAIRE: May I help
choose an outfit for you?

07:34.018 --> 07:35.367
'Cause I'm some old fossil

07:35.411 --> 07:37.108
that still puts on a suit
to go to work?

07:37.152 --> 07:39.502
-VIRTUAL CLAIRE:
Let's start over.
-Why don't we?!

07:39.546 --> 07:40.677
VIRTUAL CLAIRE:
What level of comfort

07:40.721 --> 07:41.896
are you looking for?

07:41.939 --> 07:44.899
Same thing I've had
for the last 40 years --

07:44.942 --> 07:46.378
a workplace
where you interact

07:46.422 --> 07:48.076
with actual people
every once in a while,

07:48.119 --> 07:49.425
like we're doing right now.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.340
I used to love
sales calls.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.776
Now we don't even
do them anymore.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.299
I mean, put yourself
in myshoes.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.910
VIRTUAL CLAIRE:
Dress or casual?

07:55.953 --> 07:57.346
Why do you sound like
Lauren Bacall?!

07:57.389 --> 07:58.521
I don't understand.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.957
Right, because now,
like everything,

08:00.001 --> 08:01.785
my references are old
and out of step.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.221
Why are you yelling?

08:03.265 --> 08:05.572
If you don't get it by now,
you're never gonna get it!

08:05.615 --> 08:07.661
Well, somebody'spanties
are in a bunch.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.924
VIRTUAL CLAIRE: May I offer you
a different pair?

08:09.967 --> 08:12.492
That's just weird.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.105
Ooh! Very good.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.325
MITCHELL: I had an hour
to make 100 cupcakes

08:20.369 --> 08:21.762
-for my boss's son's party.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.328
But it was all
gonna be worth it.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.634
He was gonna be so grateful,

08:24.678 --> 08:27.158
the next big promotion
would be mine.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.030
You ungrateful monster!

08:29.073 --> 08:31.598
Two sisters, two paths.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.121
Graduation...

08:33.164 --> 08:34.557
procreation.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.646
The world on a string --

08:36.690 --> 08:39.344
a baby and no ring.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.782
Uh, you -- you said
you were happy for me.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.958
You said a baby would bring me
limitless joy.

08:44.001 --> 08:44.915
And a limited bank account.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.569
Now, Manny,
no one can doubt

08:46.613 --> 08:48.615
the real-world value
of an art degree,

08:48.658 --> 08:50.921
but talk a little bit
about the exciting social scene.

08:50.965 --> 08:51.835
It's funny you ask.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.358
I went to
a wine and cheese mixer

08:53.402 --> 08:54.925
at the Dean's house
the other night.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.580
He collects instruments
of indigenous people.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.625
And by the time we killed

08:58.668 --> 09:00.409
the last bit
of a chewy Zinfandel,

09:00.452 --> 09:02.977
our jam sesh started to sound
more like a didgeri-don't.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.284
Thank you.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.025
Could I please
pipe in here?

09:08.069 --> 09:09.157
Yes, please. Alex.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.462
I genuinely appreciate

09:10.506 --> 09:12.073
the opportunity
to come back here,

09:12.116 --> 09:15.859
where I had the pleasure
of serving as co-valedictorian,

09:15.903 --> 09:17.165
to offer a message of hope

09:17.208 --> 09:21.735
to those oft-marginalized
overachievers out there.

09:21.778 --> 09:26.522
I...see...you.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.829
Well, I can't be the only one
with goose bumps in here.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.700
-Oh. Excuse me. Oh.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.746
Yes, let's open it up
for questions.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.443
Right here in the front row.
Go ahead.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.097
I still don't get "whanex."

09:36.140 --> 09:38.621
It sounds like my grandparents'
long-distance carrier in Oregon.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.666
-Okay, okay.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.058
You know what?
I have to take this.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.104
Uh, Luke, Haley,
talk a little bit about

09:43.147 --> 09:44.845
how you still live at home
with your parents.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.238
Hey, what's up?

09:47.282 --> 09:48.283
CAMERON: I'm in the middle
of my thing.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.806
-Flip what I said before.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.460
Start talking up
the dummies.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.983
What?

09:53.027 --> 09:54.419
MITCHELL: Um, I just got
a text from work.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.726
My boss gave that big case
to someone else!

09:56.770 --> 09:58.685
Meanwhile,
I'm still on the hook

09:58.728 --> 10:00.208
for these stupid cupcakes!

10:01.383 --> 10:03.646
M-My heart is racing,
my -- my hands are numb.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.693
Plus, I-I think I have a case
of airborne diabetes!

10:06.736 --> 10:09.652
Wait. Are you saying
I-I should --

10:09.696 --> 10:10.827
Look, if those college
application numbers fall,

10:10.871 --> 10:12.742
Principal Brown,
he gets fired.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.788
Guess who's up next.
Principal Tucker.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.834
I've never dared dream
of such a thing.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.096
MITCHELL: More money,

10:19.140 --> 10:20.707
better parking space,

10:20.750 --> 10:22.796
plus you get to pick
the prom theme.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.494
I could finally make
my Enchanted Bayou a reality.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.583
Okay, t-talk -- talk soon.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.063
MANNY:
What's great about art school

10:29.106 --> 10:31.152
is that a lot of the faculty
work in the industry.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.893
My film studies professor

10:32.936 --> 10:35.286
has led tours
at every major studio.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.810
All right,
thank you, Manny.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.725
And for those of you
still awake,

10:38.768 --> 10:40.683
I think what
we've learned here today is --

10:40.727 --> 10:43.468
college, a dead end.

10:47.777 --> 10:48.822
Okay, up next.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.867
Philip, Gloria, and Joe.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.129
Same setup.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.348
Dad playing catch with his son.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.697
Mom laying out a picnic.

10:54.741 --> 10:55.829
PHOTOGRAPHER:
So, just real natural.

10:55.872 --> 10:56.830
Like I'm not even here.

10:56.873 --> 10:57.918
You got it.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.139
Maybe not so sexy.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.359
-My bad.
-NANCY: He was talking to Mom.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.622
You can just lay out the food
in a normal way.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.885
Copy that.
No divas here.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.497
Her head is doing
something weird.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.585
Can we straighten that up?

11:13.629 --> 11:14.761
Hang on, guys.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.721
Why are they whispering?

11:18.765 --> 11:19.940
You think I look
too young for you?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.768
Why? Are my
crow's feet showing?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.857
I knew makeup was going
too light on the concealer.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.728
Guys, we're just
mixing and matching today,

11:25.772 --> 11:28.165
so we're thinking about
swapping out one of you.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.645
No, we're a team.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.865
You get rid of one of us,
and you lose allof us.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.736
-It's the kid.
-Okay.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.000
I thought this was
supposed to be for Joe.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.872
Well, obviously,
he's terrible at it,

11:38.915 --> 11:41.613
so how is that gonna help him
with his self-esteem?

11:41.657 --> 11:42.789
Hi, I'm Tyler.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.616
-GLORIA:
Oh, this is not good.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.922
Tyler, don't get too
comfortable.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.184
NANCY: I think we want to try
something different.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.012
Hey, Sean,
could you step up here?

11:49.056 --> 11:50.971
I'm so sorry, Phil.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.320
No, we want to look
at two dads.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.191
I can't play the kid.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.802
Looks like you're out.
Here we go.

11:55.845 --> 11:56.803
-Sean, was it?
-Yeah. Hey.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.543
-How are you?
-Good.

11:58.587 --> 12:01.242
Hmm. Not feeling
that chemistry.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.678
Maybe we should kiss?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.636
We could just wait for them
to tell us what to do.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.334
Let's try Sean and a mom.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.378
GLORIA: Move, Phil.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.293
NANCY: No, we meant Lydia.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.820
All right, almost there.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.517
Hey, Joe,
hop up here for me.

12:17.388 --> 12:20.217
Yes!
That'sour family.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.784
The new faces
of Glen Valley Mall.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.265
Everyone else can go.
Thank you.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.397
Nice working
with you guys.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.052
I have an audition
across town.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.751
-For what?
-Do they need grownups?

12:33.709 --> 12:36.190
All right, we've heard
from our college-going sheep.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.410
Now, Luke,
you wisely took a gap year,

12:39.454 --> 12:42.936
got a job, made mad stacks,
and invested a little, correct?

12:42.979 --> 12:43.937
Totally.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.853
I own 300 microrubels,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.898
a Russian cryptocurrency
I heard about on Facebook,

12:48.942 --> 12:50.465
which currently,
you can only use

12:50.508 --> 12:52.946
to buy a Chechen party drug
called Frankenstein.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.469
Okay, Haley, uh...

12:54.512 --> 12:57.864
hot boyfriend, job,
baby on the way --

12:57.907 --> 12:58.865
You seem to have it all,

12:58.908 --> 13:00.040
yet you took
a very different path

13:00.083 --> 13:01.041
than your older sister,
Alex.

13:01.084 --> 13:01.998
I'm younger!

13:02.042 --> 13:03.565
Oh, wow. Okay.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.872
I guess that's why they call
studying "the new smoking."

13:05.915 --> 13:07.003
-No one says that.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.526
Can I add --

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
I'm sure you can, but it won't
help in the real world.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.008
Anyway,
thank you all for coming.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.097
Have a good afternoon.
Take care.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.185
Cam, what the hell?

13:15.229 --> 13:16.360
I learned a lot.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.885
Tucker!

13:18.928 --> 13:21.104
I wasn't picking up
a lot of Uber fares,

13:21.148 --> 13:22.018
so I came back here early

13:22.062 --> 13:23.890
and I heard the end
of your little presentation.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.108
I know
what you're trying to do.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.458
Hey, I just need to talk to him
for -- for one second.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.851
Hey, hey. Guess what.

13:28.895 --> 13:32.072
I just dropped off the cupcakes
at my boss's house.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.857
Turns out he -- he didn't
give me the case I wanted

13:34.901 --> 13:37.120
because he had
an even better one for me.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.556
Really?
T-That's amazing.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.644
And he didn't want me
to makecupcakes.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.864
He just wanted me
to recommend a new caterer.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.736
So we had
a big laugh about that.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.565
But just goes to show,
don'tplay games.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.219
Do your job,
and you'll be recognized.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.351
Yeah, but you said --

13:50.394 --> 13:51.569
No, ah! Forget what I said.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.876
T-There's no one path
to success.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.270
I mean, that'swhat you should
be telling these kids.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.924
Yeah, that's what I was
going to tell these kids --

13:57.967 --> 13:58.925
PRINCIPAL BROWN:
Damn it, Tucker!

13:58.968 --> 14:00.970
I can't hold
my alpha power stance this long.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.146
My calves
are starting to cramp.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.801
-Okay, well, first of all --
-No, can it! Okay?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.020
You thought
you could bury me

14:07.063 --> 14:08.325
by killing
college applications,

14:08.369 --> 14:09.674
didn't you? Hmm?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.720
I will clean out my half
of the desk that I share.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.982
Oh, no, it's --
I'm so sorry.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.505
T-This is --
This is myfault.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.159
I tried to play ball
at work.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.596
There was a lot
of unnecessary baking.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.250
D-- The point is,

14:20.294 --> 14:23.036
I- I put these ideas
into his head, so...

14:23.079 --> 14:24.037
Oh.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.560
So you're so weak
and without conviction

14:25.603 --> 14:27.954
that somebody suggests
some stupid idea to you

14:27.997 --> 14:29.172
and without even thinking,

14:29.216 --> 14:30.957
you just abandon all your values

14:31.000 --> 14:33.046
and fold like
a cheap Chinese fan, huh?

14:33.089 --> 14:35.613
Yes, sir. I am a worm.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.920
That is exactly
what I'm looking for.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.704
No threat to me at all.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.142
Well, congratulations, permanent
Vice Principal Tucker.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.143
-Really?
-Yes.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.361
Thank you!
I love you!

14:44.405 --> 14:45.710
I love you, too.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.974
Now, first order of business --
fix what you did here.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.063
You are gonna give me
a Golden Apple.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.064
Hey, hey!

14:51.107 --> 14:52.804
We are in
a committed relationship!

14:52.848 --> 14:54.502
No, no, no. It's not
the same thing we saw at
Pepper's bachelor party.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.633
-It's not?
-No.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.724
After fighting with everybody
all day,

14:59.768 --> 15:02.945
I was starting to think maybe...
Iwas the jerk.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.208
So I ended up back
at the old office,

15:05.252 --> 15:06.731
you know,
trying to figure out

15:06.775 --> 15:09.430
what it was about
going to work there

15:09.473 --> 15:11.127
that I loved so much.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.219
JAY :
Congratulations.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.655
You've been hired at

15:17.699 --> 15:19.527
Pritchett's Closets,
Blinds, and Waterbeds.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.007
I'm Jay Pritchett.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.399
Welcome to the team.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.053
-JAY : You hear that?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.837
They're cheering for you
already.

15:25.881 --> 15:29.189
That's something
we value here -- teamwork.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.234
And whether you're in sales
or shipping

15:31.278 --> 15:33.410
or one of those cute tomatoes
in the steno pool,

15:33.454 --> 15:35.238
you're important,

15:35.282 --> 15:37.023
'cause we're family here.

15:37.066 --> 15:40.026
Wait a minute!
Who's this new employee?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.244
CLAIRE: It's me --
Claire, Daddy.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.768
Oh, right!
It's Claire!

15:50.384 --> 15:51.689
Nice hands.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.562
Reminds me why our softball team
never won a game.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.694
Look who they let out of
the fancy corporate office.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.349
Hey, that wife of yours
get smart and leave you yet?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.221
Eh, actually, she did.
It's been rough.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.483
KENNY: Oh.
I -- We didn't know.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.788
-LOU: Geez, I'm so sorry.
-JAY: Ah, you mutts,

16:03.832 --> 16:04.876
I'm screwing with you!

16:04.920 --> 16:05.877
Where's she going?

16:08.663 --> 16:11.492
CLAIRE: I knew my dad
was going through something,

16:11.535 --> 16:13.494
and when I saw his car
at the old office,

16:13.537 --> 16:15.278
I-I stopped by to check on him.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.150
JAY :
Are you feeling shy, Claire?

16:17.193 --> 16:20.022
Uh...yeah,
I guess I am a little.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.023
Um...

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
How old are you?

16:22.677 --> 16:23.634
CLAIRE: You're right.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.158
Just come out and say it.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.463
Um...

16:26.507 --> 16:29.249
I'm worried that you're unhappy
we sold the company

16:29.292 --> 16:30.598
and you're blaming it
on me.

16:30.641 --> 16:31.860
JAY :
You're making that face

16:31.903 --> 16:33.296
like you have to go potty.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.907
I'm anxious and --

16:35.951 --> 16:37.170
How can you even
see my face?

16:37.213 --> 16:39.433
She's my daughter.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.825
She thinks
she runs the place.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.965
TIM: You said
he wouldn't do it.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.836
JAY: You're damn right,
I did it.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.142
Boss is still the best,
huh?

16:55.710 --> 16:58.060
My dad was homesick.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.063
That is
one photogenic butt, Jay.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.978
Take it with you.
You can kiss it at home, too.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.287
-Hey, guys. Hi.
-CALVIN: Hey!

17:07.330 --> 17:08.288
Hi, Dad.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.550
Hey, what are you
doing here?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.508
I, uh, saw your car.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.510
Look...

17:13.554 --> 17:15.251
I know you've been frustrated
at work lately.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.687
Don't worry about that.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.080
You're doing great,
though, huh?

17:18.124 --> 17:20.300
Yeah, I kind of love it.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.346
But it doesn't feel right
if you hate it.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.306
Dad, we can bail
on the whole thing.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.220
You know
what I need to bail on?

17:27.263 --> 17:30.353
Being such a little peach.

17:30.397 --> 17:31.572
-Hmm?
-JAY: What?

17:31.615 --> 17:32.573
They bruise easily.

17:32.616 --> 17:33.878
It could be an expression.
I don't know.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.359
The point is, when I was here,
I reached out more.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.579
I made videos
greeting people.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.363
I built realrelationships.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.148
Those three guys --
I knew two of their names.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.716
I think maybe I need to try
to be a little bit more like you

17:45.760 --> 17:48.241
and give this new thing
a chance.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.460
You know, they're not so bad
when you get past the --

17:50.504 --> 17:53.333
the hipster beards
and the sweaty handshakes.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.204
Tell me about
that printer guy, Eduardo.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.988
What the hell
is 3-D printing anyway?

17:57.032 --> 17:58.294
Look at you trying.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.904
Oh, Dad!

17:59.948 --> 18:02.342
Okay, 3-D printing is
when you take three lasers

18:02.385 --> 18:04.126
and you can scan
any object you want.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.259
You -- You want to 3-D print
your butt, don't you?

18:06.302 --> 18:07.825
We want them to like me,
don't we?

18:07.869 --> 18:10.132
Ohh...

18:10.176 --> 18:12.352
Okay, baby,
have fun at your play date.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.266
I'll pick you up
in two hours.

18:14.310 --> 18:17.052
Can you believe
I'm a model now?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.185
Crazy world.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.056
-See you, buddy.
-Bye, baby.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.057
JOE: Bye, Mom!

18:23.276 --> 18:24.973
Gosh, I'm so happy
for that kid.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.410
Yeah, we keep saying that.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.196
I feel, uh, silly
I got so invested in modeling

18:30.239 --> 18:33.155
for some mall poster
no one's ever gonna see.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.417
You want to feel better?

18:34.461 --> 18:36.071
I'll show you something

18:36.115 --> 18:38.726
that is gonna make me look
more pathetic than you do.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.858
I think I said "silly,"
but, um...

18:40.902 --> 18:42.338
yeah, okay.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.387
That was me
20 years ago.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.867
PHIL:
That's amazing.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.434
But what are you
so upset about?

18:51.478 --> 18:53.306
You're just as beautiful now
as you were then.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.525
Aww. I know.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.614
It's just that it was
a time in my life

18:57.658 --> 19:03.446
where I was out there hustling,
modeling, driving a taxi,

19:03.490 --> 19:06.449
selling bacon-wrapped hot dogs
outside a nightclub.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.452
Seeing them taking it down

19:09.496 --> 19:11.889
made me feel like
that version of me

19:11.933 --> 19:13.326
is gone forever.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.763
So that's why you wanted
to start modeling again.

19:15.806 --> 19:19.419
I just miss being passionate
about something again.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.986
The way that you feel passionate
about real estate.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.466
-Mm.
-You always seem, like,

19:23.510 --> 19:27.122
so alive, making new deals,
meeting new people.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.430
Have you ever thought
about becoming a Realtor?

19:30.473 --> 19:33.128
-Who hasn't?
-That's true.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.609
I bought a book one time
to learn how to do it,

19:35.652 --> 19:37.350
but you know how it is.

19:37.393 --> 19:41.005
Sometimes in life,
you just get stuck.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.007
I think you'd be great at it.
Really.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.487
I'd buy anything
from you.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.315
I'm thinking about getting
my chompers bleached,

19:46.359 --> 19:47.403
and there's only
half of you up there.

19:47.447 --> 19:50.014
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:50.058 --> 19:53.017
GLORIA: It can be scary
to ask yourself what's next.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.629
All the doubts
start to creep in.

19:55.672 --> 19:58.675
Are people
going to like me?

19:58.719 --> 20:00.068
Ooh, still hot.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.461
Thank you!

20:01.504 --> 20:03.376
I throw a tractor tire
around the backyard

20:03.419 --> 20:04.855
a couple days a week.

20:06.117 --> 20:11.035
GLORIA:
Can I handle the challenge?

20:11.079 --> 20:12.385
WOMAN: Dude.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.955
GLORIA: You can ask these
questions forever,

20:17.999 --> 20:20.480
or you can just
take the first step.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.526
Here is your five-point
checklist for any open house.

20:23.570 --> 20:24.658
Number one --

20:27.313 --> 20:29.053
Sorry, professor.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.538
CLAIRE: Phil, honey.
What are you doing here?

20:35.582 --> 20:36.496
Hey,
I thought I'd surprise you

20:36.539 --> 20:38.106
and take you out to dinner.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.412
-Ooh!

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
Spontaneous.
You know I like that.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Well, um, let me just make sure
everybody's gone.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.417
I'll grab my bag
and lock up.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.548
Awesome.

20:49.422 --> 20:52.163
VIRTUAL CLAIRE: May I help you
with your clothes?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.469
Ooh.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.776
I guess we are
the only ones here.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.344
VIRTUAL CLAIRE: Perhaps we'll
start with the pants.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.345
Wow.

21:00.389 --> 21:01.564
Normally,
you like a little...

21:01.608 --> 21:03.305
slow shirt unbuttoning,

21:03.349 --> 21:07.309
but I guess we...
are cutting to the chase.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.484
CLAIRE:

21:08.528 --> 21:10.094
Dad, are you still looking
for a place

21:10.138 --> 21:11.444
to leave that butt?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.749
It's so gross.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.403
There's nothing better
for office camaraderie

21:14.447 --> 21:15.361
than a practical joke.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.363
It lifts people's spirits.

21:17.406 --> 21:18.364
Mm.

21:22.455 --> 21:23.499
Well played.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.290
