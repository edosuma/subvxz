(horn honks in distance)

00:05.198 --> 00:08.201
* *

00:10.336 --> 00:12.705
It's Lucy.

00:12.805 --> 00:14.940
I didn't know
she did another show.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.277
In the '60s, after her divorce
from Desi Arnaz.

00:18.377 --> 00:20.379
Oh, no. They broke up?

00:20.479 --> 00:23.482
I know, right?
America's comedy sweethearts.

00:23.549 --> 00:25.718
Everything they touched
turned to gold,

00:25.851 --> 00:27.520
or so it seemed.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.156
In reality, Desi was a drunk
and they fought backstage

00:30.223 --> 00:31.957
-like a house on fire.
-WOMAN: No, I'm telling you,
that's not him.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.359
Couldn't last.

00:33.459 --> 00:35.461
-SHOPPER: That's a shame.
-That's who that is.

00:35.561 --> 00:37.196
-WOMAN: You don't know
what you're talking about.
-Excuse me.

00:37.296 --> 00:39.298
Is there an issue?

00:39.398 --> 00:41.066
Yeah, I need to get a poster

00:41.167 --> 00:42.901
for my journalism club
at school.

00:43.035 --> 00:44.470
I just want to know
who this guy is

00:44.570 --> 00:45.738
and he's trying to tell me
it's Walter Cronkite.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.906
Go restock the Dr. Quinn hats,

00:48.006 --> 00:50.909
something you can't mess up.

00:52.077 --> 00:53.512
I mean, it's not, right?

00:53.579 --> 00:55.914
No, I'm sorry about that.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.251
No, of course not.
That's Edward R. Murrow.

00:58.351 --> 01:00.553
CBS newsman way before our time.

01:00.653 --> 01:02.020
But I bet you know his sign-off,

01:02.087 --> 01:03.422
"Good night and good luck."

01:03.556 --> 01:06.392
Murrow's all right,
little left for me.

01:06.492 --> 01:08.093
I'm more of a Winchell guy.

01:08.227 --> 01:09.395
Who?

01:13.599 --> 01:15.834
Picture Jazz Age, New York,

01:15.934 --> 01:18.437
a reporter in a trench coat
and a snap-brim fedora,

01:18.537 --> 01:21.174
ready with a wisecrack
and a hot tip on the mob.

01:21.274 --> 01:23.509
Plus some Broadway buzz.
Oh, and some dirt

01:23.609 --> 01:26.445
on the Roosevelts too--
that's Walter Winchell.

01:26.545 --> 01:30.783
He did it all with panache.
The best that ever lived.

01:32.518 --> 01:34.587
I just need a poster.

01:40.359 --> 01:42.428
-(door opens)
-Dale.

01:42.528 --> 01:44.797
Sorry if I was sharp
with you earlier.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.632
I'm your manager.
You should feel free

01:46.765 --> 01:48.201
to come to me
if there's ever a question

01:48.301 --> 01:50.135
-you need an answer to.
-I'm only working here

01:50.236 --> 01:51.804
until I sell my screenplay.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.920

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.942
You've got mail.

(static crackling)

05:59.518 --> 06:01.554
(clinking)

06:13.999 --> 06:15.868
-MONICA: Hi there.
-WOMAN: Morning, Monica.

06:21.139 --> 06:24.910
KEN:
Linda. Can I see you a moment?

06:34.720 --> 06:36.421
Just a quick question...

06:36.555 --> 06:37.923
Is this about
the Newsweek reporter?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.725
Ken, he came unannounced.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.527
What? No.

06:41.594 --> 06:43.562
I wanted to ask--
and this is last-minute--

06:43.662 --> 06:45.498
but do you know who
Gerald McRaney is?

06:45.598 --> 06:47.566
-He's a, uh, actor.
-Oh, yes.

06:47.666 --> 06:49.502
-Major Dad.
-Okay.

06:49.602 --> 06:50.736
Well, he's gonna be in D.C.

06:50.836 --> 06:52.705
and apparently
wants a tour of Andrews.

06:52.771 --> 06:53.872
Can you set that up?

06:53.939 --> 06:59.945
Just a...
Sorry, a-a one-off tour?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.047
I know, it's not usually
what you do, Linda,

07:02.114 --> 07:04.182
but... can you help us out?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.423
(clears throat)

07:12.891 --> 07:14.760
Let's take a walk.

07:19.197 --> 07:20.699
(sighs)

07:21.800 --> 07:23.035
MONICA:
So what did Mr. Bacon want?

07:23.135 --> 07:25.538
I have to arrange a tour
of Andrews Air Force Base

07:25.638 --> 07:27.906
-for Gerald McRaney.
-Who?

07:27.973 --> 07:29.608
Major Dad, Monica.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.644
Look, that's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.211
Something happened

07:33.311 --> 07:35.413
while you were over in the
West Wing doing God knows what.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.884
I'm at my desk, I look up
and there's Michael Isikoff.

07:38.984 --> 07:42.054
He's a Newsweek reporter.
He's very salacious,

07:42.154 --> 07:44.890
always digging on
the president's affairs.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.725
Oh, what was he doing there?

07:46.825 --> 07:50.495
My ex-friend Kathleen,
she's purporting to be

07:50.629 --> 07:53.666
the victim of an unwelcome
advance from your boyfriend.

07:53.799 --> 07:55.834
Except she's not calling it
an advance.

07:55.968 --> 07:58.604
-She's calling it an assault.
-What do you mean, as assault?

07:58.671 --> 07:59.838
I don't know, Monica.

07:59.972 --> 08:02.507
-I have to tell Bill.
-Absolutely not.

08:02.641 --> 08:04.677
I don't want my name involved.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.680
Anyway, I've already reached out
to a high-level contact

08:07.813 --> 08:08.747
at the White House.

08:08.847 --> 08:10.148
Bruce Lindsey
in the Counsel's Office.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.750
Okay, that was very smart.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.351
Now you can just leave it alone.

08:13.485 --> 08:15.621
This is an explosive situation.

08:15.688 --> 08:18.591
I need to think strategically,
I need to talk to Kathleen.

08:18.691 --> 08:21.960
No. Listen to me,
leave it alone.

08:22.027 --> 08:25.030
Okay, I will not talk to Bill.
You don't call anyone.

08:25.163 --> 08:27.332
If you do nothing,
there's no story.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.504
McRANEY (on TV):
Do you have any plans
for tonight?

08:32.605 --> 08:34.707
MATT MULHERN:
Hey, sir, are you kidding?

08:34.807 --> 08:37.209
-It's Friday night.
-Oh, then you're free.

08:37.309 --> 08:41.113
-(laughter)
-Well, yeah.

08:41.213 --> 08:43.381
Why do you ask?

08:43.481 --> 08:45.517
(phone ringing)

08:53.692 --> 08:54.893
Hello?

08:56.294 --> 08:57.562
LINDA:
Kathleen.

08:58.897 --> 09:01.133
It's Linda Tripp.

09:01.233 --> 09:03.301
It's been a long time.

09:03.401 --> 09:04.703
How are you?

09:04.803 --> 09:08.741
Well, a journalist showed up
at my work yesterday.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.542
I-I hope he didn't bother you.

09:10.643 --> 09:13.478
I'm not even sure if I'm going
to go on the record or not.

09:13.578 --> 09:16.314
On the record
about what, Kathleen?

09:16.414 --> 09:21.419
About what occurred
between the president and me.

09:21.553 --> 09:23.822
What are you saying occurred?

09:23.922 --> 09:25.758
You know.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.593
I feel like I don't know.

09:28.727 --> 09:31.596
You saw me right after.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.900
Near the Oval. Remember?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.601
I can't believe you're
putting me in this position.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.203
(scoffs)

09:38.270 --> 09:40.605
I'm sorry. I just thought you
could tell them what happened.

09:40.706 --> 09:44.109
Kathleen, if I am forced to
talk to a reporter,

09:44.209 --> 09:46.278
this is what I honestly
remember happening.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.747
I remember you and the president

09:48.847 --> 09:51.616
flirting whenever
you saw each other in the hall,

09:51.750 --> 09:53.351
and you talking constantly about

09:53.451 --> 09:55.353
how attractive he was.

09:55.453 --> 09:56.789
And yes, I do remember
seeing you that day.

09:56.922 --> 09:58.290
You asked for my lipstick

09:58.423 --> 10:02.027
and you looked like
you were on cloud nine.

10:02.127 --> 10:05.297
So, I have to wonder
what on earth possessed you

10:05.430 --> 10:08.133
to send Michael Isikoff
to my desk when you know

10:08.266 --> 10:10.936
I know the reality
of the situation.

10:12.537 --> 10:15.407
-Hello?
-Why are you saying all this?

10:15.473 --> 10:16.975
Because it's true.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.811
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

10:18.944 --> 10:20.979
I know you and I didn't...

10:21.113 --> 10:23.882
(sniffles) part on good terms,
but for you

10:23.982 --> 10:25.818
-to try and-and lie...
-(line beeps)

10:25.951 --> 10:28.553
H-Hold on. Hold on.
There's a call waiting.

10:28.653 --> 10:29.888
MULHERN (on TV):
Like what, sir?

10:29.988 --> 10:31.323
-McRANEY: Well, you know...
-Hello.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.891
Did Bruce Lindsey
get back to you?

10:32.991 --> 10:34.226
H-Hold on one second.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.730
Kathleen, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.564
In the future,
don't have the press

10:39.664 --> 10:41.399
ontact me without my approval.c

10:41.499 --> 10:42.835
Hmm?

10:45.170 --> 10:47.105
Monica.

10:47.172 --> 10:48.841
No, it's still me.

10:48.974 --> 10:52.010
Who's Moni...

10:52.144 --> 10:53.078
Hi.

10:53.178 --> 10:54.446
Did you get ahold of him?

10:54.512 --> 10:58.183
No. I've emailed twice more.
Nothing.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.019
Not from anyone
at the White House.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.688
Linda.

11:03.822 --> 11:05.123
Not good.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.325
(chewing)

11:07.425 --> 11:10.929

-(seagulls screeching)

11:11.029 --> 11:14.666
PAULA: "Sit down. You were
picked out of a lineup.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.701
You're not going anywhere."

11:17.669 --> 11:19.704
STEVE:
I didn't do anything.

11:19.838 --> 11:22.374
"I know you sent someone
to kill my wife last night."

11:22.507 --> 11:25.010
It sounds like you
got a problem.

11:25.110 --> 11:29.381
"No, you're the one
with a problem. Two of them.

11:29.481 --> 11:35.187
One is murder with special
circumstances. The other is me."

11:37.122 --> 11:39.724
You're not giving me anything
to react to.

11:39.858 --> 11:41.493
Well, I'm not good like you are.

11:41.559 --> 11:43.061
Can you fucking try?

11:43.195 --> 11:44.396
I'm sorry. I...

11:44.496 --> 11:45.730
Just shh...

11:45.831 --> 11:48.066
I didn't
do anything.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.135
I didn't do anything.

11:50.235 --> 11:51.236
All right, one more.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.674
"Sit down.

11:56.741 --> 12:01.713
You were picked out of a lineup.
You're not going anywhere."

12:01.814 --> 12:04.582
I done... I didn't...

12:04.716 --> 12:06.819
Fuck!

12:06.919 --> 12:08.253
I can't fucking focus!

12:08.386 --> 12:10.588
-Okay, we can go back.
-I've got no space to work

12:10.688 --> 12:12.424
in this shithole.
Every time I go down to Redondo,

12:12.557 --> 12:15.760
there's press out there saying,
"Where's Paula? How's Paula?"

12:15.861 --> 12:17.095
But I'm the one
who has to go to work

12:17.229 --> 12:19.397
at a job I hate to provide
for my family.

12:19.497 --> 12:20.598
I know, baby.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.766
Oh, you know?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.601
You know, do you?
You know what it's like?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.103
Going into work,

12:25.203 --> 12:27.705
having the airport ops guys
laughing behind my back,

12:27.772 --> 12:32.744
thinking my wife got down on
her knees and blew Bill Clinton.

12:33.846 --> 12:35.280
Steve, you're scaring me.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.916
This is all making you so mad.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.955
I just can't stop picturing it.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.690
You and him in that hotel room.

12:45.790 --> 12:48.961
What do you mean?
What-what are you saying?

12:51.096 --> 12:55.533
Hey, you know what happened.
Look at me.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.469
(phone ringing)

12:59.471 --> 13:02.774
None of this means nothing
if you don't believe me.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.477
Yeah?

13:05.577 --> 13:07.045
Are you together?

13:07.145 --> 13:10.215
Put me on speaker.
Turn on the TV.

13:12.284 --> 13:13.986
It's Susan.

13:14.119 --> 13:15.620
(phone beeps)

13:18.957 --> 13:21.626
...that the Constitution
does not protect Mr. Clinton,

13:21.726 --> 13:23.161
or any other president,

13:23.295 --> 13:26.164
rom lawsuits that are unrelatedf
o his official duties.t

13:26.264 --> 13:28.500
-PAULA: Oh, my gosh.
-This means specifically
that the lawsuit

13:28.633 --> 13:30.668
against Mr. Clinton
brought by Paula Jones...

13:30.768 --> 13:34.739
-We did it. We won!
-(dog barking)

13:34.839 --> 13:36.474
Paula, you got all of them.

13:36.574 --> 13:39.111
Even that little Jewish lady.

13:39.177 --> 13:42.347
Even she said, Paula,
you have the right

13:42.447 --> 13:46.184
to take him to court and
make him answer for what he did.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.520
-(line beeps)
-Oh, that's probably
the hubby calling.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.855
I'll try you back.
Happy, happy!

13:50.989 --> 13:52.524
PETER JENNINGS:
John Paul Stevens writing,

13:52.657 --> 13:55.093
"Like every other citizen,
Paula Jones

13:55.193 --> 13:57.662
has a right to an orderly
disposition of her claims."

13:57.762 --> 13:59.497
You believe this?

13:59.597 --> 14:01.699
(both laughing)

14:01.833 --> 14:03.701
-Oh, my God!
-Yes!

14:03.835 --> 14:05.170
-(laughs)
-Fuck yes. Fuck yes!

14:05.270 --> 14:06.504
Fuck you!

14:06.604 --> 14:07.872
NEWSMAN: It's important
for her to proceed,

14:07.973 --> 14:09.274
because what's at issue
in this case

14:09.374 --> 14:11.209
is reputation.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.777
NEWSMAN 2:
The Supreme Court
has reaffirmed

14:12.877 --> 14:15.280
that no one is above the law,
no matter their...

14:15.380 --> 14:17.549
NEWSMAN 3:
Why doesn't the president

14:17.682 --> 14:19.117
of the United States simply
come out and say, "I..."

14:19.217 --> 14:20.318
NEWSMAN 4:
The time has come.

14:20.385 --> 14:23.721
His running away from this
is over.

14:25.390 --> 14:28.393
-(knocking)
-(rain pattering)

14:28.493 --> 14:31.196
-Sir, Bob Bennett.
-Thank you.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.799
Evening, Mr. President.

14:42.574 --> 14:45.177
-You need to talk about...
-Nine to zero?

14:46.911 --> 14:49.914
Nine to fucking zero?

14:50.015 --> 14:52.050
Couldn't even get Ruth?

14:52.150 --> 14:54.219
This is horseshit, Bob.

14:54.319 --> 14:56.488
It's the worst decision
in the history of the court.

14:56.588 --> 14:58.590
Well, Dred Scott...

14:58.690 --> 15:00.892
Don't talk to me
about Dred Scott.

15:02.827 --> 15:05.497
Y-You know what
I'm doing this week?

15:05.597 --> 15:07.399
I'm getting Russia to turn away

15:07.499 --> 15:10.235
every missile it has
pointing at a NATO target,

15:10.335 --> 15:11.436
all of them.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.006
It's a lot,
but I keep getting sidetracked

15:14.106 --> 15:16.274
by this fucking witch hunt.

15:16.408 --> 15:19.611
I'm unhappy too, Mr. President,
but now that this has happened,

15:19.744 --> 15:22.780
we need to
talk about next steps.

15:22.914 --> 15:26.284
If I can be candid, I think
you should settle this case.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.187
What? You think
that'll stop this?

15:29.287 --> 15:31.423
This Lonoke girl is just a pawn.

15:31.523 --> 15:35.360
Bob, I lost money on
some Ozark vacation homes,

15:35.460 --> 15:37.629
and now I've got a prosecutor
going after everyone

15:37.762 --> 15:40.598
who's ever met me. You know,
they want to indict Hillary

15:40.698 --> 15:43.801
over a discrepancy on some
12-year-old billing records.

15:43.935 --> 15:47.472
Our best friend died,
shot himself in the head.

15:47.605 --> 15:50.375
Instead of displaying
even a moment of grace,

15:50.475 --> 15:53.078
they went out that day
and said we murdered him.

15:53.145 --> 15:54.546
They have no shame.

15:54.646 --> 15:56.548
They're trying to
use the legal system

15:56.648 --> 15:58.983
to overturn an election,
and they won't stop

15:59.117 --> 16:00.718
until I give in
and leave office.

16:00.818 --> 16:02.454
Well, that's not happening.

16:02.554 --> 16:04.322
It's fucking not.

16:05.990 --> 16:11.463
Well, in that case,
Mr. President, we go to trial.

16:11.563 --> 16:14.732
Leave it up to a jury
who to believe.

16:14.832 --> 16:16.568
We're preparing for that.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.904
She's not the innocent
she claims to be.

16:20.004 --> 16:22.840
We got people in the field
looking into her past.

16:22.974 --> 16:26.844
But as you must know,
they will do the same to you.

16:30.182 --> 16:32.117
She'll never let me settle.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.319
-Paula Jones, I don't think...
-No.

16:37.021 --> 16:38.356
Hillary.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.167
(blender whirring)

16:54.872 --> 16:59.377
USH LIMBAUGH:R
merica held hostage, day 1,639.A

16:59.511 --> 17:02.780
Today, folks, we learned Mrs.
Clinton took a $50,000 check

17:02.880 --> 17:07.719
from a Chinaman who wanted
a photo op in the Oval.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.035
(sighs)

17:32.410 --> 17:34.546
(dials)

17:36.848 --> 17:38.850
ISIKOFF: Hi, Linda, this is
Michael Isikoff of Newsweek,

17:38.916 --> 17:40.918
following up, wanted to see
if you'd spoken

17:41.018 --> 17:42.487
with Kathleen Willey.

17:42.587 --> 17:44.389
-My God.
-Yeah. Anyway,

17:44.489 --> 17:46.224
you know, just let me know.

17:46.324 --> 17:48.693
I believe you know
how to get ahold of me, so...

17:48.760 --> 17:50.928
-Thanks.
-(scoffs)

17:51.028 --> 17:52.930
Astounding.

17:54.832 --> 17:56.201
Astounding.

18:00.172 --> 18:01.406
ISIKOFF:
Linda.

18:04.108 --> 18:06.278
On what planet
was leaving a message

18:06.411 --> 18:08.880
on my Pentagon-issued machine
a good idea?

18:08.946 --> 18:11.349
-Okay, it was...
-I refuse to participate
in this debacle.

18:11.449 --> 18:12.750
(scoffs)

18:12.850 --> 18:14.786
And yes, I did speak to Kathleen
and suffice to say,

18:14.886 --> 18:16.788
I won't be confirming her story

18:16.888 --> 18:18.556
for one minor
inconvenient reason.

18:18.623 --> 18:20.124
Which is?

18:20.225 --> 18:22.026
I know the truth.

18:22.126 --> 18:24.229
What do you mean?
What's the truth?

18:24.296 --> 18:27.465
I'm very busy. I have to go.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.635
-Do not call me at the Pentagon.
-Okay.

18:30.768 --> 18:33.638
If you absolutely have
to call me, call me at home.

18:35.072 --> 18:40.111
If you get my machine or one
of my kids, your name is Harvey.

18:41.313 --> 18:42.647
Okay.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.950
Harvey.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.723
-Are you excited?
-To meet Matt Drudge?

18:51.823 --> 18:54.226
-No, no. To see your crush.
-Ugh.

18:54.326 --> 18:56.994
I'm excited. You're so awkward
in her presence.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.163
Please, do not cause
an incident.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.832
(Coulter laughs)

19:02.099 --> 19:04.135
(knocking)

19:04.236 --> 19:05.770
Also, she's a lesbian.

19:05.837 --> 19:08.506
She is not.
She used to date Dinesh D'Souza.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.941
-There he is.
-Laura!

19:10.007 --> 19:12.009
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

19:12.143 --> 19:13.511
(laughs):
Hi.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.647
Oh... hello, Coulter.

19:15.747 --> 19:17.915
-Ingraham.
-Mm.

19:18.015 --> 19:20.685
This way. Coat check
is to your left.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.688
Tom. Tom, if you haven't
tried one of those,

19:23.821 --> 19:25.857
you are missing out.
Get in there.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.661
(indistinct chatter)

19:29.761 --> 19:35.032
What must it be like
to be a grayscale Xerox of me?

19:35.166 --> 19:37.302
I don't see how
she could be your Xerox,

19:37.369 --> 19:39.971
when, unlike you, she attended
an elite law school.

19:40.037 --> 19:41.939
Michigan is top ten.

19:42.039 --> 19:45.377
See, that's among the saddest
sentences I've ever heard.

19:47.379 --> 19:48.546
Oh, there's Drudge.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.649
COULTER:
That's what he looks like?

19:51.716 --> 19:53.885
-My God.
-INGRAHAM: George.

19:54.852 --> 19:56.321
Meet Matt.

19:56.388 --> 19:57.789
Drudge Report is one
of the biggest sites

19:57.889 --> 19:59.557
on the World Wide Web.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.726
I've been addicted ever since
you reported Ken Starr

20:01.859 --> 20:04.028
wanted to indict Hillary
for perjury.

20:04.128 --> 20:05.797
How do you get this stuff?

20:05.897 --> 20:08.065
-(chuckles)
-COULTER: Nice hat.

20:08.199 --> 20:09.501
Is it serious?

20:09.567 --> 20:14.238
Oh, I cannot believe
I am meeting you.

20:14.372 --> 20:15.807
Thank you. How kind.

20:15.907 --> 20:17.975
My friend George here
is of counsel

20:18.075 --> 20:19.711
at Wachtell Lipton
up in New York,

20:19.811 --> 20:22.046
but he's also one of the elves.

20:22.146 --> 20:23.247
The elves?
What are the elves?

20:23.381 --> 20:25.249
It's a name Ann gave us.

20:25.383 --> 20:27.519
We're a group of attorneys
with day jobs,

20:27.585 --> 20:30.422
but we gather at night
and do what we can to help

20:30.555 --> 20:31.923
the Paula Jones suit move along.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.926
Oh, I love that. Well,
you know, that's what I do.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.061
-I move stories along.
-Great to finally

20:37.161 --> 20:38.863
have an ally
in the news business.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.865
(chuckles)
What took so long?

20:40.932 --> 20:42.934
Well, my dear Ann,

20:43.034 --> 20:44.602
the Internet
needed to be invented.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.171
You know how many people read
the holy goddamn New York Times?

20:47.271 --> 20:48.440
About a million.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.608
At the rate I'm going,
I'll blow past that

20:50.742 --> 20:52.109
by the end of next year.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.011
Print is dead.

20:54.111 --> 20:56.781
Speaking of, I hear
another woman's come forward.

20:56.914 --> 20:58.115
Is that true?

20:58.249 --> 21:00.184
CONWAY:
Uh...

21:01.553 --> 21:05.623
I make no claims
under oath or affirmation.

21:07.692 --> 21:09.126
But...

21:10.462 --> 21:13.230
...if such a woman exists,

21:13.297 --> 21:15.800
her claims are highly credible

21:15.933 --> 21:18.135
and she's talking to
Mike Isikoff at Newsweek.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.303
Really?

21:19.437 --> 21:22.106
Just keep my name out of it.

21:24.442 --> 21:27.211
All right, well, I've gotta
keep him circulating.

21:27.311 --> 21:29.146
Uh, Matt, there's my gal pal,
works at Rutherford.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.415
Cynthia.

21:30.482 --> 21:32.484
She and I golf together
in Palm Springs.

21:34.486 --> 21:36.153
(smacks lips)

21:39.223 --> 21:40.925
(indistinct chatter)

21:40.992 --> 21:42.427
You're ridiculous.

21:42.494 --> 21:44.462
-Am I?
-Mm-hmm.

21:47.164 --> 21:49.467
*

21:53.237 --> 21:55.306
(crows cawing in distance)

21:55.407 --> 21:56.908
(knocking)

21:57.008 --> 21:58.009
(door opens)

21:58.142 --> 22:00.445
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

22:00.512 --> 22:02.480
It's fine.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.352
Monica is calling again.

22:08.486 --> 22:10.855
She keeps asking
when she can come visit.

22:12.857 --> 22:15.527
She has more gifts
she'd like to give you.

22:18.530 --> 22:20.031
She's a good girl.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.833
She's gonna keep reaching out.

22:24.602 --> 22:26.704
Tell her I'm busy.

22:33.711 --> 22:35.146
Actually, Betty?

22:35.212 --> 22:36.548
Sir.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.350
Tell her to come in.

22:40.384 --> 22:41.786
Tonight.

22:41.886 --> 22:43.555
Yes, sir.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.959
*

22:53.531 --> 22:54.566
MONICA:
Hi there.

22:54.699 --> 22:55.967
You look lovely.

22:56.067 --> 22:57.569
Oh. Really?

22:57.702 --> 23:00.071
Thanks. I feel flushed.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.238
This was so last-minute.

23:01.372 --> 23:04.075
I had to run home
to grab this and change.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.309
(knocking)

23:05.409 --> 23:06.911
(door opens)

23:11.883 --> 23:13.651
I come bearing gifts.

23:13.751 --> 23:14.819
Wow.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.521
What have we got here?

23:16.588 --> 23:18.490
I know you don't go
to the Vineyard for a bit,

23:18.590 --> 23:20.925
but I wanted to make sure
you had a beach read.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.594
(exhales)

23:34.539 --> 23:37.775
-Oh.
-It's my favorite book
from college.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.848
When I said "beach read,"

23:43.948 --> 23:45.617
it was kind of a joke.
(chuckles softly)

23:45.717 --> 23:47.384
I, uh...

23:47.451 --> 23:50.454
I just-I know that
you've read everything, so...

23:50.555 --> 23:52.524
Wow.

23:52.624 --> 23:53.791
That's, uh...

23:53.925 --> 23:55.292
That's great.

23:58.863 --> 24:01.766
You want to... get a Diet Coke?

24:26.090 --> 24:27.659
I wanted to...

24:27.759 --> 24:29.460
talk a minute.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.330
I've been thinking about you.

24:33.464 --> 24:36.233
Yeah, I've been thinking
about you, too.

24:39.837 --> 24:40.805
You know this, uh...

24:40.905 --> 24:43.007
this thing between us?

24:44.676 --> 24:47.444
I started it back up again
when I knew I shouldn't.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.582
I couldn't stop myself.

24:51.849 --> 24:53.417
The fact is...

24:55.587 --> 24:57.154
...it's not right.

24:57.254 --> 24:58.155
No, it is right.

24:58.255 --> 25:00.157
No, it's not, Monica.

25:00.257 --> 25:01.192
It's not right for you,

25:01.292 --> 25:02.326
and it's not right
for my family.

25:02.426 --> 25:03.527
No, how could I feel all of this

25:03.628 --> 25:05.296
-and it not be right?
-Monica, listen, please,

25:05.362 --> 25:07.298
I need you to understand.

25:07.364 --> 25:09.433
I've been down this road.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.608
When I hit 40,
I-I was governor of Arkansas.

25:16.708 --> 25:19.210
Hillary was top dog at her firm.

25:20.177 --> 25:23.214
We had a beautiful
six-year-old girl

25:23.347 --> 25:25.382
who felt like a miracle.

25:26.383 --> 25:29.721
But I started
to put all that at risk.

25:29.854 --> 25:32.556
And I hated myself.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.558
My only option was to walk away.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.227
Divorce, quit politics.

25:37.228 --> 25:39.330
I thought, you know,
if I have to work

25:39.396 --> 25:41.065
in a gas station
to be an honest man,

25:41.198 --> 25:42.834
then so be it.

25:46.704 --> 25:48.673
But I couldn't leave.

25:50.908 --> 25:52.644
It was Chelsea.

25:54.578 --> 25:56.648
And so I cut it out.

25:57.982 --> 25:59.751
I committed to my marriage.

26:00.718 --> 26:02.854
My family.

26:04.889 --> 26:06.758
Monica...

26:08.559 --> 26:11.763
I can't do this with you
anymore.

26:14.932 --> 26:16.400
(inhales)

26:16.500 --> 26:20.504
I was so happy
when Betty called me in today.

26:20.604 --> 26:21.706
I thought you just wanted

26:21.773 --> 26:24.776
-to see me.
-I still want you in my life.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.511
If you and I
are just friends, then...

26:27.611 --> 26:29.613
Monica, lis-listen to me.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.616
-You are a special,
vibrant girl.
-(inhales, shudders)

26:32.750 --> 26:34.451
And you don't see it yet,
but you're just becoming

26:34.585 --> 26:36.620
the person
who you're going to be.

26:36.754 --> 26:39.891
And that woman is gonna do
stunning, marvelous things.

26:39.957 --> 26:41.192
I just want to be here with you.

26:41.292 --> 26:42.359
That's exactly it.

26:42.459 --> 26:43.795
If you and I are just friends,

26:43.928 --> 26:46.297
then you can come see me
and-and it won't matter

26:46.397 --> 26:47.965
what anyone says.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.867
(knocking)

26:49.967 --> 26:51.302
BETTY:
Mr. President?

26:51.435 --> 26:52.970
Prime Minister Blair.

26:53.971 --> 26:56.708
Oh. Come here.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.215
McRANEY (on TV):
I want to know where
you've been all night.

27:04.315 --> 27:07.384
And don't tell me the Midnight
Madness sale at Toys"R"Us.

27:07.484 --> 27:09.220
-(chuckles)
-MULHERN: Oh, I'm sorry
if we worried you, sir,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.255
but Amanda and I
were having such a good time

27:11.322 --> 27:12.824
that we-we didn't realize
how late it was.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.325
-McRANEY: Oh.
-(phone rings)

27:14.425 --> 27:16.160
And sunrise
didn't give you a clue?

27:16.293 --> 27:18.462
-Hello?
-(Monica crying)

27:18.562 --> 27:20.064
McRANEY:
I demand to know
what you two have been...

27:20.164 --> 27:22.333
(crying):
Linda, please.

27:23.634 --> 27:25.636
-Oh, Jesus.
-(crying continues)

27:26.603 --> 27:28.639
Monica.

27:31.408 --> 27:33.510
I'll meet you at your place.

27:33.644 --> 27:34.746
(crying)

27:34.846 --> 27:36.180
(sighs)

27:36.280 --> 27:37.681
I'll be back in a few.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.784
What is going on with her?
She calls constantly...

27:39.851 --> 27:41.118
She's in a bad situation.

27:41.185 --> 27:42.286
She needs a friend.

27:42.353 --> 27:43.988
(audience laughing)

27:50.594 --> 27:52.329
Oh, no. Oh.

27:53.765 --> 27:55.032
Mm.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.300
MONICA:
He said

27:56.367 --> 27:59.470
he still wanted to be friends
and then, uh...

27:59.536 --> 28:02.539
Tony Blair called
and he gave me a hug

28:02.673 --> 28:06.043
and I left and I sobbed
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.446
What do you think it means?

28:09.546 --> 28:11.048
I'm fucking dumped.

28:12.016 --> 28:14.618
I've only been suffering at
the Pentagon because I thought

28:14.718 --> 28:16.453
I was going back
to the White House.

28:16.553 --> 28:17.889
Wait, did he say
you're not going back?

28:18.022 --> 28:19.356
(scoffs)
Like everything else with Bill,

28:19.456 --> 28:20.724
that's not exactly up to me.

28:20.858 --> 28:23.460
He can't do this to you.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.629
This is the same thing
they did to me.

28:25.729 --> 28:26.864
You know what though?

28:28.365 --> 28:30.802
I actually kind of respect him
more after today.

28:30.902 --> 28:34.571
He was so open about
his struggle to stay faithful.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.741
Monica, listen to yourself.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.476
What? He's in a lot of pain.

28:39.576 --> 28:40.812
You're in a lot of pain.

28:40.912 --> 28:43.915
He chose to start a relationship
with an intern,

28:44.048 --> 28:46.918
which got you kicked out
of the White House.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.153
And then he strung you along
for an eternity.

28:49.253 --> 28:51.655
And then he dumps you
and you're supposed to be fine?

28:51.755 --> 28:53.157
No.

28:53.257 --> 28:54.591
Absolutely not.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.228
This has been a calamity
for you professionally.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.496
You're not dating anymore,

28:59.596 --> 29:02.366
he has to bring you back
at least.

29:02.433 --> 29:03.935
He has to.

29:04.068 --> 29:06.337
He has the power to do that
in five minutes.

29:06.437 --> 29:09.073
How do I ask him to do that?

29:09.173 --> 29:11.008
You can write him a letter.

29:11.108 --> 29:13.110
* *

29:17.714 --> 29:19.583
Okay.

29:20.852 --> 29:22.286
(sighs)

29:25.957 --> 29:27.358
This is too polite.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.793
You should start
with something that, uh,

29:29.927 --> 29:32.396
makes it clear how you feel.

29:32.463 --> 29:33.730
(chuckles):
Okay.

29:33.797 --> 29:35.299
(exhales)

29:36.433 --> 29:37.902
"I feel..."

29:38.903 --> 29:40.137
I don't know.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.542
Disposable.

29:46.810 --> 29:48.379
Insignificant.

29:48.479 --> 29:50.647
Used.

29:54.218 --> 29:55.419
Good.

29:56.387 --> 29:58.822
"I feel disposable, used

29:58.956 --> 30:00.491
"and insignificant.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.326
"I understand
your hands are tied

30:02.459 --> 30:04.728
but I need to discuss
my employment situation with..."

30:04.828 --> 30:06.563
You know what?
This has to be tougher.

30:06.663 --> 30:08.665
Otherwise,
he's just gonna bring you in,

30:08.799 --> 30:11.168
smile and tell you
what you want to hear.

30:11.302 --> 30:13.004
"I was a good girl

30:13.137 --> 30:15.506
"when I was sent
to the Pentagon.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.008
"I waited patiently
because I believed

30:17.108 --> 30:18.842
"I would return
to the White House.

30:18.976 --> 30:20.677
"If that does not happen

30:20.811 --> 30:23.647
I'm going to have to explain
to my parents why."

30:23.747 --> 30:26.350
I-I can't give him that.
It'll make him upset.

30:26.483 --> 30:28.785
How many times has he upset you?

30:30.687 --> 30:32.689
(inhales deeply)

30:33.690 --> 30:34.825
(sighs)

30:36.193 --> 30:39.163
I'd say it's about time.

30:45.937 --> 30:49.206
Wow.
Very All the President's Men.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.208
This is fantastic.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.110
Wh-Why did you want to see me?

30:53.210 --> 30:54.878
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.714
You know, most reporters
like you avoid the sex beat.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.050
I'm not on the sex beat.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.451
I-I write about abuse of power.

31:00.551 --> 31:03.387
Sex is one way
this president goes about that.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.388
Gotcha.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.890
Roger that. It's too true.

31:08.225 --> 31:10.294
Can I ask, is...

31:10.394 --> 31:11.963
is this for real?

31:12.063 --> 31:15.232
The voice. The... costume.

31:16.467 --> 31:18.502
When I was a kid,

31:18.569 --> 31:21.238
my heroes were
the provocative press of yore.

31:21.338 --> 31:24.241
Back when hacks had a knife
and knew how to use it.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.578
So I got to wondering, "Whatever
happened to newsmen like that?"

31:27.678 --> 31:28.812
So I became one.

31:28.912 --> 31:32.749
Without a degree in,
I don't know, journalism?

31:32.849 --> 31:34.751
I can see why you'd say that.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.588
Most people here went to
the same fancy colleges, right?

31:37.688 --> 31:38.755
Must have been nice.

31:38.889 --> 31:40.424
You know where I went
after high school?

31:40.557 --> 31:41.825
7-Eleven.

31:41.925 --> 31:44.261
I got shut out of that game.
I couldn't afford it.

31:44.395 --> 31:47.064
And then, one day, I buy a modem

31:47.164 --> 31:50.367
and the whole news business
cracks right open.

31:50.434 --> 31:52.769
I don't know
that unsourced Internet gossip

31:52.869 --> 31:54.105
has cracked open
the news business.

31:54.205 --> 31:55.672
(chuckles)

31:55.772 --> 31:57.241
Well, you're probably right.

31:57.341 --> 31:58.442
You're probably right.

31:59.443 --> 32:01.745
Speaking of gossip,

32:01.845 --> 32:03.947
I heard
you're working on a new story

32:04.081 --> 32:06.017
about another woman
our dear leader harassed.

32:06.117 --> 32:08.452
(stammers)
Where... Who...

32:08.552 --> 32:10.621
Who told you that?

32:15.859 --> 32:17.594
Gossip.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.564
(knocking)

32:20.631 --> 32:23.134
Remember, no tears.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.976
I have three things
to say to you.

32:33.077 --> 32:35.146
First, it is illegal

32:35.279 --> 32:36.647
to threaten the president

32:36.780 --> 32:38.815
-of the United Sta...
-I wasn't threatening.

32:38.949 --> 32:40.917
I told you things
I haven't bared to anyone.

32:40.984 --> 32:43.154
To have that honesty
used against me like this,

32:43.254 --> 32:44.655
when you sat here
and told me you understood...

32:44.755 --> 32:46.123
-What do you mean? I...
-What do you think

32:46.223 --> 32:48.659
my fucking life is like?

32:48.792 --> 32:51.162
Do you think what I need
in my day is a nasty letter

32:51.295 --> 32:53.497
that conveys nothing
but disrespect and ingratitude?

32:53.630 --> 32:54.731
What exactly am I supposed

32:54.831 --> 32:56.500
-to be grateful for?
-Lower your voice.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.834
You promised
you would bring me back,

32:57.934 --> 32:59.403
and then
you barely even called me.

32:59.503 --> 33:00.904
So I just sat
in my apartment alone,

33:01.004 --> 33:03.674
just waiting for you
and waiting for you.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.076
Do you know
what those nights were like?

33:05.176 --> 33:06.510
Monica,

33:06.643 --> 33:08.679
I was running for president.

33:08.812 --> 33:11.682
That does nothing to explain
why you lied to my face.

33:14.318 --> 33:17.421
Ask me how many days
I just sat there,

33:17.521 --> 33:20.357
thinking I was so stupid
to believe you.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.926
But I was stuck in this loop...
(sniffles)

33:23.026 --> 33:25.429
thinking, "This will
be the moment it'll ring

33:25.529 --> 33:27.098
and it'll be you,
because you promised."

33:27.198 --> 33:29.300
And then just when I was ready
to give it all up,

33:29.366 --> 33:30.501
you call me back in.

33:30.601 --> 33:32.203
But it's not
to give me my job back--

33:32.303 --> 33:34.338
it's just to use me up
a few more times,

33:34.438 --> 33:36.773
like I'm a worthless...
(mouths)

33:36.873 --> 33:38.642
No, that is not true,
and you know it.

33:38.709 --> 33:40.544
No, I-I don't ever,

33:40.677 --> 33:42.146
ever want you to think that.

33:42.213 --> 33:43.814
That is not what you are to me.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.350
I'm not supposed to cry.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.385
It's okay.

33:48.519 --> 33:51.522
You know?
You're-you're just like me.

33:51.622 --> 33:53.023
You know? We feel things deeply.

33:53.124 --> 33:55.292
We can't keep 'em inside.

33:55.392 --> 33:57.561
I wish it was different.

33:57.694 --> 33:59.696
I wish I had more time for you.

34:04.735 --> 34:07.871
I'm-I'm sorry
I was so crazy in that letter.

34:07.971 --> 34:11.242
I've been waiting
to come back here for so long.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.409
I know.

34:13.410 --> 34:17.080
I'll... help
with the job situation.

34:18.081 --> 34:20.651
But no more of this, okay?

34:24.188 --> 34:26.089
Are we friends?

34:30.026 --> 34:31.928
Of course.
(chuckles softly)

34:32.062 --> 34:33.397
(knocking)

34:33.497 --> 34:35.599
And there's Betty,

34:35.699 --> 34:37.334
here to tell you
it's time to talk

34:37.434 --> 34:40.171
to the premier of Uzbekistan
or something.

34:42.105 --> 34:44.007
I almost forgot.
A reporter at Newsweek

34:44.107 --> 34:47.511
asked my friend from work
to comment on a story.

34:47.611 --> 34:49.946
Some crazy woman said
you harassed her.

34:52.249 --> 34:54.050
Is her name...

34:54.117 --> 34:55.752
Kathleen Willey?

34:56.753 --> 34:57.854
Yeah, I think it is.

34:57.954 --> 34:59.890
She called here.

35:01.124 --> 35:03.294
She made it sound like Newsweek
was chasing her down,

35:03.427 --> 35:05.396
trying to get her to say things.

35:06.797 --> 35:08.098
(printer whirring)

35:10.066 --> 35:11.802
Oh, Jesus Christ.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.137
Colleen,
what's going on with this?

35:14.271 --> 35:15.806
The colors are wacko.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.809
The yellows didn't come through,
and it-it looks off.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.811
I know. FSD is coming to...

35:20.944 --> 35:23.980
I have to hand this
to Gerald McRaney in 20 hours.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.048
I'm flying blind.

35:25.148 --> 35:27.818
Tomorrow is too late.

35:35.158 --> 35:36.159
How did it go?

35:36.260 --> 35:37.160
Don't be mad.

35:37.294 --> 35:38.495
What?

35:38.595 --> 35:40.964
I kind of talked to him
about Kathleen Willey.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.167
You told him?

35:44.301 --> 35:45.736
-Yes. I'm sorry.
-Monica,

35:45.836 --> 35:47.003
did you tell him my name?

35:47.103 --> 35:49.172
Because I cannot get pulled
into this.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.174
-They already know who I am.
-I know, I know.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.610
-I didn't talk to him about you.
Don't get so excited.
-Well... (scoffs)

35:53.677 --> 35:55.946
-I'm not excited.
-Can you just listen to me?

35:56.012 --> 35:57.448
There is something weird
going on.

35:57.514 --> 36:00.183
Because he already knew
about Kathleen and Newsweek.

36:00.317 --> 36:02.519
What do you mean
he already knew?

36:02.653 --> 36:04.755
-Is Isikoff talking to them?
-No.

36:04.855 --> 36:07.190
Kathleen Willey called
the White House,

36:07.291 --> 36:09.493
and she's telling
an entirely different story.

36:13.364 --> 36:15.198
(Linda scoffs)

36:15.332 --> 36:16.800
Linda.

36:16.867 --> 36:18.369
(groans softly)
Linda.

36:19.336 --> 36:21.872
-(doorbell rings)
-(knocking)

36:22.005 --> 36:24.040
(dog barking in distance)

36:35.051 --> 36:36.219
(door creaking)

36:38.655 --> 36:40.391
Oh. Linda.

36:40.524 --> 36:44.027
You can go ahead right now and
tell me what your game is here.

36:44.127 --> 36:45.296
Is this about Michael Isikoff?

36:45.396 --> 36:47.230
'Cause I told him
to stop bothering you.

36:47.364 --> 36:48.865
(scoffs)

36:50.066 --> 36:52.068
You're talking
to the White House.

36:52.202 --> 36:53.470
Why?

36:54.405 --> 36:56.239
(door closes)

36:57.874 --> 37:00.076
How do you know that?

37:00.176 --> 37:01.845
I can't say.

37:02.879 --> 37:04.648
What's going on?

37:04.748 --> 37:06.082
I know it doesn't make
any sense,

37:06.216 --> 37:07.751
but Isikoff called.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.920
He knew things.

37:10.020 --> 37:14.090
A-And we talked
about the incident.

37:14.224 --> 37:17.361
And then later I felt scared
and I called Bruce Lindsey.

37:17.428 --> 37:19.530
I was just trying
to protect myself.

37:19.596 --> 37:21.865
-I didn't want them
to come after me.
-You don't have

37:21.932 --> 37:24.100
to remind me what
the Clintons are capable of.

37:24.234 --> 37:25.201
So you understand.

37:25.268 --> 37:27.871
No, actually, I don't.

37:27.938 --> 37:29.606
This is inane.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.743
And in no universe will
my distaste for this president

37:32.843 --> 37:35.346
make me participate
in your charade,

37:35.446 --> 37:37.348
as though you're a victim

37:37.448 --> 37:40.116
-of some sort of atrocity.
-(chuckles softly)

37:40.250 --> 37:42.619
My integrity matters.

37:44.187 --> 37:46.390
(chuckles)
How could I be so dumb?

37:48.625 --> 37:49.860
What do you mean?

37:49.960 --> 37:50.894
I worked with you

37:50.961 --> 37:52.529
for almost two years,

37:52.629 --> 37:53.864
and, somehow,

37:53.964 --> 37:55.366
I forgot who you are.

37:55.466 --> 37:57.468
You love this.

37:57.568 --> 37:59.636
You love the drama.

37:59.770 --> 38:02.706
You love having a Newsweek
reporter come by your desk,

38:02.806 --> 38:04.107
telling him you don't believe me

38:04.207 --> 38:06.443
and somehow making it
all about you.

38:06.543 --> 38:09.279
This is exactly where
you want to be--

38:09.380 --> 38:11.648
in someone else's business,
in my business.

38:11.782 --> 38:13.384
Because in your own life,

38:13.484 --> 38:16.820
there's absolutely nothing.

38:20.323 --> 38:23.560
I feel sad for you.

38:25.295 --> 38:27.464
I truly do.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.672
*

38:40.010 --> 38:41.945
(knocking)

38:49.019 --> 38:50.854
If I had known all I had to do
to see you more

38:50.954 --> 38:52.856
was break up with you, I would
have dumped you months ago.

38:52.989 --> 38:55.859
Your friend at work,
is her name Linda Tripp?

38:57.461 --> 38:58.629
Yeah. How did you know that?

38:58.695 --> 39:01.297
Do you trust Linda Tripp?

39:01.364 --> 39:02.766
Yes.

39:02.866 --> 39:04.701
Have you told her about us?

39:04.801 --> 39:06.470
No.

39:08.539 --> 39:10.040
Kathleen called again.

39:11.341 --> 39:13.510
Somehow, word got back

39:13.610 --> 39:16.547
that she's talking to us
about the Newsweek article.

39:18.715 --> 39:22.018
I'm just wondering
how that might have happened.

39:26.056 --> 39:27.057
Do me a favor.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.392
Have Linda Tripp give us a call.

39:29.526 --> 39:31.394
She can, uh,
reach out to Bruce Lindsey

39:31.495 --> 39:33.363
up in the Counsel's Office.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.570
Betty'll call you tomorrow
to follow up on that, okay?

39:39.703 --> 39:41.538
Thanks.

39:58.589 --> 39:59.923
(beeps)

40:01.725 --> 40:03.259
Hey, Bob.

40:05.028 --> 40:08.899
I think we should talk
about settling with Paula Jones.

40:18.609 --> 40:20.611
-(phone rings in distance)
-(keys clacking)

40:23.213 --> 40:25.115
(exhales)
Hey.

40:25.215 --> 40:26.783
Not now. I'm crazed.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.451
Okay, but have you thought
about, um,

40:28.552 --> 40:30.120
just trying Bruce Lindsey's
office just one more time?

40:30.220 --> 40:32.956
-Just...
-Is this coming
from the big creep?

40:33.089 --> 40:34.457
Did you talk to him again?

40:34.591 --> 40:35.959
No. I just think
it would be a great idea.

40:36.092 --> 40:37.894
Well, I remind you,
I did contact Bruce Lindsey.

40:37.961 --> 40:39.763
Apparently, I'm not important
enough to get a reply.

40:39.863 --> 40:41.965
-But I think, this time,
it will be different.
-If they want to call me,

40:42.065 --> 40:44.100
they know where I work.
I'm sorry, Monica,

40:44.200 --> 40:45.636
I have to finish this.

40:45.769 --> 40:49.139
Gerald McRaney's plane lands
in less than two hours.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.612
(quiet chatter)

40:59.983 --> 41:01.384
Your story's up.

41:01.484 --> 41:03.654
What do you mean it's up?

41:07.658 --> 41:09.159
Sorry, buddy.

41:13.997 --> 41:15.165
(dialing)

41:16.633 --> 41:17.734
(line ringing)

41:17.834 --> 41:19.670
Go for Drudge.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.838
What are you doing?

41:21.972 --> 41:23.506
I'm just reporting the news.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.175
This is my news,

41:25.308 --> 41:27.010
news I'm still working on.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.178
Look, it's nothing personal.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.847
I saw a great scoop
and so I went for it.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.516
It's not even a story yet.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.952
Well, the fact that
you're working on it is a story.

41:36.019 --> 41:36.953
No, it's not.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.522
All you have is unsourced fluff.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.024
I-It's a rumor.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.526
It's just Internet gossip.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.596
It's worthless.

41:45.696 --> 41:48.832
Then why are you so upset?

41:48.932 --> 41:50.701
(phone clacking in cradle)

41:51.702 --> 41:52.703
(exhales sharply)

41:59.710 --> 42:01.878
Oh. Linda. Mm.

42:01.978 --> 42:02.946
Sorry to do this.

42:03.046 --> 42:04.881
Um, I just got a call.

42:05.015 --> 42:07.317
McRaney's stuck on the Hill
in something,

42:07.383 --> 42:10.887
so he's not gonna have time
for that tour today after all.

42:11.021 --> 42:12.022
Oh.

42:12.122 --> 42:13.556
Yeah. W-Well, but...

42:13.690 --> 42:16.226
thank you
for throwing it together.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.394
You are a trooper.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.563
(quietly):
Anyway... yeah, let's go.

42:20.664 --> 42:22.565
(continues indistinctly)

42:31.407 --> 42:33.409
*

42:44.587 --> 42:46.589
(muffled crunching)

42:50.260 --> 42:52.262
(phone ringing echoes)

42:55.899 --> 42:58.101
(phone ringing)

43:01.271 --> 43:03.273
(ringing continues)

43:08.712 --> 43:09.846
JCOC.

43:09.946 --> 43:11.782
Linda Tripp speaking.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.349
ISIKOFF:
It's Harvey.

43:14.517 --> 43:16.619
(quietly):
Why are you calling me here?

43:16.720 --> 43:18.789
Have you seen Drudge?

43:22.525 --> 43:24.127
(clicking mouse)

43:27.764 --> 43:30.633
(keys clacking)

43:34.971 --> 43:36.873
Oh, my.

43:38.809 --> 43:40.310
Did you leak this?

43:40.443 --> 43:43.747
What? He stole my story.

43:43.814 --> 43:45.048
Okay, Harvey,

43:45.148 --> 43:47.383
you must calm down.

43:47.483 --> 43:49.152
Listen, I have to have someone
on the record

43:49.252 --> 43:50.721
so I can publish now.

43:50.821 --> 43:52.155
Kathleen's not returning
my calls.

43:52.288 --> 43:53.389
I-I need you.

43:53.489 --> 43:55.158
-Please.
-I've made it very plain.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.893
I don't want to get involved.

43:56.993 --> 43:59.295
We're talking
about an incendiary story,

43:59.395 --> 44:00.463
and you are asking me

44:00.563 --> 44:02.432
to put my name in print. It...

44:02.498 --> 44:03.499
(scoffs)

44:03.633 --> 44:05.468
It boggles the mind.

44:07.670 --> 44:09.339
(sighs)

44:11.307 --> 44:13.276
But...

44:13.343 --> 44:16.012
let me see what I can do.

44:17.180 --> 44:18.982
Unfortunately, I am very busy.

44:19.082 --> 44:22.185
You don't know what it's like
over here at DoD. It's...

44:22.318 --> 44:23.854
-mania.
-(sighs)

44:26.156 --> 44:27.357
Okay.

44:27.490 --> 44:28.524
You know what?

44:29.592 --> 44:31.161
Sunday,

44:31.261 --> 44:32.796
3:00 p.m.

44:32.863 --> 44:34.865
Take down this address.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.713
Hi. Can we help you today?

44:50.814 --> 44:53.183
Hi. My name is... Harvey.

44:53.283 --> 44:55.518
I'm here to see Linda.

44:55.618 --> 44:59.122
Oh. That's right. Yeah, she's,
um, just around the corner.

44:59.222 --> 45:02.125
(hair dryer blowing)

45:02.225 --> 45:03.459
(sighs)

45:06.229 --> 45:07.563
Right on time.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.165
This is too public.

45:09.232 --> 45:11.067
I need to get quotes from you.

45:11.167 --> 45:12.135
Oh, it's fine.

45:12.235 --> 45:14.470
He doesn't speak
a word of English.

45:14.570 --> 45:16.139
(sighs)

45:16.239 --> 45:17.140
Okay.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.474
(clears throat)

45:18.574 --> 45:20.811
So, if you could tell me
about the afternoon...

45:20.911 --> 45:24.080
The image of that day
is crystal clear in my mind.

45:24.180 --> 45:27.250
I was walking near the Oval
when I saw Kathleen.

45:27.350 --> 45:28.484
She was...

45:28.584 --> 45:31.922
flustered but excited.

45:32.022 --> 45:33.556
Happy, even.

45:33.656 --> 45:37.427
I noticed immediately that
her hair was slightly askew.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.595
Her lipstick was off. And...

45:39.695 --> 45:40.931
she later told me
what had happened.

45:41.031 --> 45:43.166
The president had taken her
to a small hideaway

45:43.266 --> 45:46.369
off the Oval
and he'd kissed her.

45:46.436 --> 45:49.705
And there was... some touching
over the clothes.

45:49.772 --> 45:52.108
-She told you this when?
-That day.

45:52.208 --> 45:55.011
This was not a case
of sexual harassment,

45:55.111 --> 45:57.580
and she was not in any way
appalled.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.950
You can quote me on that.

46:00.083 --> 46:03.419
Right. We agreed all of this
is on the record, so...

46:03.519 --> 46:07.023
Wh-Why do you think
she now feels differently?

46:07.123 --> 46:08.758
I can't say.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.727
My heart does go out to her.

46:11.794 --> 46:12.863
She's widowed now.

46:12.963 --> 46:14.965
She feels alone.

46:15.065 --> 46:17.968
Things have not worked out
the way she wanted in life.

46:18.068 --> 46:20.570
So what is she doing?
She's reaching out to you.

46:20.636 --> 46:21.972
She's reaching out to everyone.

46:22.105 --> 46:24.440
She's inserting herself.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.042
She wants to matter.

46:26.142 --> 46:28.979
-It's... very sad.
-Mm.

46:29.112 --> 46:31.114
STYLIST:
Okay, dear.

46:31.214 --> 46:32.215
To the dryer now.

46:32.315 --> 46:34.317
This is all great. Thank you.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.052
Wait.
(scoffs)

46:36.152 --> 46:38.321
-That's it?
-Yep.

46:38.454 --> 46:39.990
What do we do next?

46:40.123 --> 46:42.225
Well, I'll call the White House
for comment,

46:42.325 --> 46:44.895
the president's lawyer
will deny it and...

46:44.995 --> 46:46.662
then we publish next week.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.732
Anyway, it was nice to meet you,
Linda. I appreciate your help.

46:49.832 --> 46:52.335
There was a question
you could have asked.

46:52.468 --> 46:54.570
You didn't ask it.

46:54.670 --> 46:55.771
What?

46:56.806 --> 47:00.476
You're looking through
a keyhole, Isikoff. (chuckles)

47:00.576 --> 47:03.346
There's a larger context
to this.

47:03.446 --> 47:05.148
Much larger.

47:06.116 --> 47:08.251
Off the record.

47:12.355 --> 47:14.925
I started in the West Wing
under Bush.

47:15.025 --> 47:17.427
And when Clinton came in, I...

47:17.527 --> 47:19.029
I wanted to respect him.

47:19.129 --> 47:21.097
But what I saw

47:21.197 --> 47:22.865
shocked me to my core.

47:22.966 --> 47:24.834
He uses women like paper towels.

47:24.935 --> 47:26.702
-I know.
-No,

47:26.802 --> 47:28.504
you don't.

47:28.604 --> 47:30.173
You don't know the half of it.

47:30.273 --> 47:31.541
What I've been a party to--

47:31.641 --> 47:34.710
and I mean recently--
goes beyond Kathleen,

47:34.810 --> 47:36.346
beyond Paula Jones.

47:36.446 --> 47:37.713
It's beyond imagining.

47:37.847 --> 47:39.615
What-what are you talking about?

47:39.715 --> 47:41.451
There's a woman right now.

47:41.551 --> 47:43.219
A woman I'm very close to.

47:43.353 --> 47:46.122
She's young.

47:46.222 --> 47:48.658
Younger than I've ever known him
to go.

47:48.724 --> 47:51.661
I'm talking just a few years
older than Chelsea.

47:51.727 --> 47:53.563
Who is she?

47:54.564 --> 47:55.565
I can't tell you that.

47:55.698 --> 47:56.899
Does she work for him?

47:57.000 --> 47:58.734
She was a White House intern
when it started.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.371
-This is sexual harassment.
-No.

48:01.471 --> 48:03.373
It's an affair.

48:03.473 --> 48:06.709
He's subjecting her
to emotional torture.

48:07.677 --> 48:08.811
She's in love with him.

48:08.911 --> 48:10.746
She'll never talk.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.914
Ah.

48:12.048 --> 48:13.984
That's very good gossip.

48:14.084 --> 48:15.751
No, it's not gossip.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.321
You should see
what this girl is going through.

48:18.421 --> 48:19.322
If she's not gonna talk,

48:19.422 --> 48:20.823
-there's no story.
-What?

48:20.923 --> 48:22.358
Of course there is.

48:22.425 --> 48:24.660
You have no idea
how inappropriate...

48:24.760 --> 48:26.929
Michael Isikoff?
(chuckles)

48:27.030 --> 48:29.432
You will go anywhere
for a story, won't you?

48:29.565 --> 48:31.401
Oh. No, uh, this is...

48:31.501 --> 48:32.735
We're cousins.

48:32.835 --> 48:34.904
ANNE:
Oh. (chuckles)
Thought for a moment

48:35.005 --> 48:36.939
this was
the mysterious Kathleen Willey.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.674
Far from.
(chuckles)

48:38.774 --> 48:40.110
I'm Harriet.

48:40.243 --> 48:42.378
Anne Farris.
I work at the Washington Post.

48:42.445 --> 48:44.880
I actually was just leaving.

48:44.947 --> 48:46.616
It was good to see you, Anne.
I'll...

48:46.716 --> 48:49.385
talk to you soon.

48:49.452 --> 48:51.621
LINDA:
(exhales) He's a wonderful guy.

48:51.721 --> 48:53.956
He's a fabulous cousin to me.

48:54.090 --> 48:55.525
(door opens)

49:03.366 --> 49:05.968
Listen, I don't think it's
appropriate for the president

49:06.069 --> 49:08.304
of the United States
to get down in the gutter,

49:08.404 --> 49:10.140
where Ms. Jones
wants to drag him.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.642
I think he would see
a settlement as something

49:12.775 --> 49:15.745
to be done
for the good of the nation.

49:15.811 --> 49:19.315
-(exhales)
-I feel like I just watched
the Challenger explode.

49:19.415 --> 49:22.218
-That's a bit out-of-bounds.
-It's not

49:22.318 --> 49:24.720
a joke, Jerome.
This is a disaster.

49:24.820 --> 49:26.156
Her lawyers want a deal.

49:26.256 --> 49:28.791
-They just do.
-Great.

49:28.891 --> 49:31.327
Great.
So the law lets him slide.

49:31.461 --> 49:33.463
The press lets him slide.

49:33.563 --> 49:35.565
What a disgrace.

49:35.665 --> 49:37.900
Being the president used
to mean something.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.237
Even Nixon was capable of shame.

49:41.337 --> 49:45.675
But after this, just think
what kind of flabby con men

49:45.775 --> 49:47.843
will see a path
to the White House.

49:47.977 --> 49:50.180
The corruption.

49:50.313 --> 49:52.082
(chuckles):
The lies.

49:52.182 --> 49:54.917
The hundred million
cocktail waitresses he's groped

49:55.017 --> 49:56.086
or worse.

49:56.186 --> 49:57.520
If we let this slide...

49:57.620 --> 49:59.289
We're not letting this slide.

49:59.355 --> 50:01.691
Then we stop the settlement.

50:03.826 --> 50:05.361
Whatever it takes.

50:10.666 --> 50:12.702
(quiet chatter)

50:23.879 --> 50:25.715
Uh-huh.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.717
So, um...

50:29.885 --> 50:30.886
Just got 'em.

50:31.987 --> 50:33.723
I'll take two.

50:33.823 --> 50:34.890
Three.

50:35.891 --> 50:37.327
Three.

50:43.199 --> 50:45.235
*

50:49.839 --> 50:51.207
(exhales)

50:53.008 --> 50:55.044
(panting softly)

51:15.698 --> 51:17.066
(chuckles softly)

51:31.080 --> 51:32.615
(scoffs)

51:32.748 --> 51:33.783
(starts engine)

51:38.454 --> 51:40.456
(quiet chatter)

51:42.925 --> 51:43.959
Oh.

51:44.093 --> 51:45.261
Where's Paula?

51:45.361 --> 51:46.929
Ladies' room.

51:47.029 --> 51:49.199
Hurry up and wait, right?
(chuckles)

51:49.299 --> 51:51.100
(scoffs)

51:56.138 --> 51:58.474
Not that I was surprised
to get the call.

51:58.574 --> 52:00.210
I knew he'd try to settle.

52:00.310 --> 52:01.977
If I'm Bill Clinton,

52:02.077 --> 52:05.114
I'm more than a little worried
about the dirty laundry

52:05.215 --> 52:06.782
this case might turn up.
(chuckles softly)

52:06.882 --> 52:09.118
Should be a good offer then.

52:09.219 --> 52:10.119
Oh, should be.

52:10.220 --> 52:11.487
Better than good.
(chuckles)

52:11.621 --> 52:15.958
Money won't be real to him
anyway. Mm.

52:17.893 --> 52:20.263
Well, you see, this is what
no one ever tells you.

52:20.330 --> 52:21.997
Politician like that,

52:22.131 --> 52:24.500
he has
big general liability policies.

52:24.634 --> 52:27.169
If you settle, you get a check
from an insurance company.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.504
He won't pay a dime.

52:28.604 --> 52:30.673
And I hate to say it, but...
(sighs)

52:30.806 --> 52:33.276
Oh. (stammers)
Never mind.

52:33.343 --> 52:35.177
No, what?

52:37.146 --> 52:39.415
If she accepts his offer,

52:39.515 --> 52:41.851
I-I do worry
there could be whispers.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.419
Mm. "She won
the Supreme Court case.

52:43.519 --> 52:46.155
Why would she let him off easy?"

52:46.256 --> 52:47.690
Fair or not,

52:47.823 --> 52:49.859
people will always...

52:49.992 --> 52:53.529
wonder what really happened
in that hotel room.

52:55.465 --> 52:56.932
Ah!

52:57.032 --> 52:58.368
Oh.

52:58.468 --> 53:00.035
Don't you look cute?

53:00.169 --> 53:01.036
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

53:01.170 --> 53:02.705
-PAULA: (giggles) Mwah.
-Mwah.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.440
Ooh, we were having
such a good chat.

53:04.540 --> 53:06.041
-PAULA: You were?
-Mm-hmm.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.510
PAULA:
What y'all talk about?

53:07.610 --> 53:09.879
(door creaks)

53:10.012 --> 53:11.046
DAVIS:
Mm.

53:11.180 --> 53:12.348
Get comfortable, folks.

53:12.448 --> 53:14.384
Great. Thank you.

53:14.517 --> 53:15.618
DAVIS:
Nice to see you again.

53:15.718 --> 53:16.686
SUSAN:
Nice to see you.

53:16.786 --> 53:18.388
(door closes)

53:21.190 --> 53:23.326
Sometimes...

53:23.393 --> 53:24.560
you get what you want.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.562
"The parties agree
that Paula Corbin Jones

53:26.696 --> 53:29.231
"did not engage in any improper
or sexual conduct

53:29.332 --> 53:31.467
"on May 8, 1991,

53:31.567 --> 53:33.903
"and that the allegations
and the inferences about her

53:34.003 --> 53:36.306
"published in
the American Spectator are false

53:36.406 --> 53:38.073
"and their adverse effects
on her character

53:38.207 --> 53:40.376
and reputation regrettable."

53:42.345 --> 53:44.314
DAVIS:
You get your good name back.

53:44.414 --> 53:46.316
From the president himself.

53:46.416 --> 53:48.551
But that's not all.

53:49.752 --> 53:52.822
Our complaint asked
for $700,000.

53:52.922 --> 53:54.990
You know what number
they agreed to?

53:56.926 --> 53:58.428
$700,000.

53:58.561 --> 54:00.430
Every dime.

54:00.530 --> 54:02.832
-(chuckles)
-Oh, my gosh.

54:02.932 --> 54:04.266
We're so happy for you.

54:04.367 --> 54:06.369
SUSAN:
That $700,000--

54:06.436 --> 54:09.238
is that coming
from Clinton himself

54:09.339 --> 54:10.773
or from his insurers?

54:10.906 --> 54:15.778
Well, insurance. But it's
the number we asked for.

54:15.878 --> 54:17.112
Anyway,

54:17.212 --> 54:18.781
next steps.

54:18.881 --> 54:20.383
-Why don't we go over...
-Can we have the room?

54:21.517 --> 54:22.718
Please?

54:24.954 --> 54:28.190
So we can speak privately.

54:31.461 --> 54:32.962
Of course.

54:33.095 --> 54:35.931
Thank you so much.

54:48.310 --> 54:49.645
-(door closes)
-Well,

54:49.745 --> 54:51.447
since they didn't ask Paula,

54:51.547 --> 54:52.715
I will.

54:52.815 --> 54:54.049
What do you think?

54:54.149 --> 54:56.886
I think it's even more
than I ever thought

54:56.986 --> 54:58.588
-we'd ever get.
-He needs to apologize.

54:58.654 --> 55:00.723
This is not an apology.

55:00.823 --> 55:02.057
PAULA: Steve,
we could have a normal life.

55:02.157 --> 55:04.259
But even better
than a normal life,

55:04.326 --> 55:06.996
'cause we'll have $700,000.

55:07.096 --> 55:09.432
They get a big chunk of that,
Paula-Poo.

55:09.499 --> 55:11.634
Oh, I know, Susie,
but you got to understand--

55:11.734 --> 55:12.902
we are not from Pasadena.

55:13.002 --> 55:15.471
And even $100,000 would be

55:15.571 --> 55:18.574
more than anyone in my family
has seen...

55:18.674 --> 55:20.009
all our lives.

55:20.109 --> 55:22.311
Oh, gosh. I'm just thinking
about the kind of house

55:22.412 --> 55:23.846
-that we could get back home
in Lonoke County.
-(stammers)

55:23.979 --> 55:26.482
-And I...
-Wh-What are you talking about?

55:26.582 --> 55:27.683
Well, I was just thinking
that...

55:27.817 --> 55:30.620
I don't want to go back
to Lonoke County.

55:30.686 --> 55:33.355
It doesn't matter how much money
this is to your people.

55:33.456 --> 55:34.857
It's not from them.

55:34.990 --> 55:36.526
It's not even from him.

55:36.626 --> 55:38.093
The only thing
that would hurt him

55:38.193 --> 55:40.696
even a tiny bit
is if he had to apologize.

55:40.830 --> 55:42.698
"I did those things
to that woman,

55:42.832 --> 55:45.034
and she did not want them."

55:45.167 --> 55:46.368
Does that thing say that?

55:48.270 --> 55:49.539
(mouths)

55:49.672 --> 55:50.940
No, but this could change
our lives.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.374
This is an insult, Paula.

55:52.475 --> 55:53.543
And if you don't take it
that way,

55:53.676 --> 55:56.211
I have to wonder,
why the fuck not?

55:59.849 --> 56:02.351
Can't even believe
we're talking about this.

56:15.364 --> 56:16.699
(door creaks)

56:16.799 --> 56:18.901
We talked it over.

56:22.337 --> 56:23.573
Paula and I say no deal.

56:23.706 --> 56:25.575
(door closes)

56:25.675 --> 56:27.977
We asked for an apology.

56:28.077 --> 56:29.411
Where is it?

56:29.512 --> 56:32.081
He'll go to trial
before he apologizes.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.749
Fine.

56:33.883 --> 56:38.387
It'll be her word
against a president's.

56:39.755 --> 56:42.692
Paula, you have to understand

56:42.758 --> 56:44.927
what will come out in a trial.

56:45.027 --> 56:45.928
I'm sorry,
what are you trying to say?

56:46.061 --> 56:47.563
That you will lose.

56:47.663 --> 56:49.765
In devastating fashion.

56:49.865 --> 56:52.535
But, first, Paula...

56:53.769 --> 56:55.938
...they're gonna drag your name
through mud.

56:56.038 --> 56:58.340
They're gonna bring your past
to light.

56:58.440 --> 57:00.442
Think of the witnesses
they'll call.

57:00.576 --> 57:02.712
Think of the stories
they'll tell.

57:02.778 --> 57:07.416
They want to be sure
no woman dares try this again.

57:08.751 --> 57:11.420
-This is your victory.
-(paper rustles)

57:12.387 --> 57:13.956
You have it.

57:14.056 --> 57:15.457
Right now.

57:16.458 --> 57:18.027
You've won.

57:18.127 --> 57:20.462
* *

57:24.534 --> 57:27.069
I'm sorry, Gil.
