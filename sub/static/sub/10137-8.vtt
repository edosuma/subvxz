The microphone,

07:09.763 --> 07:12.640
the drums, and the co..

07:12.682 --> 07:15.518
Look at this. See, this is

07:12.682 --> 07:15.518
exactly what I'm talking about.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
Empty napkin holder,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
I ordered special napkins

07:17.687 --> 07:20.232
and are they in here?

07:17.687 --> 07:20.232
No.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.406
Napkins! Napkins!

07:27.447 --> 07:29.741
Flypaper. Flypaper.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.838
Ah, here they are.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.838
Napkins.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.341
"The Smush Club."

07:47.801 --> 07:50.553
I specifically

07:47.801 --> 07:50.553
ordered the Smash..

07:50.595 --> 07:53.514
Well, maybe Becky's right. Maybe

07:50.595 --> 07:53.514
I just need to let out a good..

07:53.556 --> 07:55.475
Aah!

07:55.516 --> 07:57.227
Aah!

07:59.062 --> 08:00.230
- What are you doing?

07:59.062 --> 08:00.230
- Don't kill me.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.023
I'll get back to work.

08:05.860 --> 08:10.365
What we have here

08:05.860 --> 08:10.365
is shoddy craftsmanship.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.117
Give me that.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.622
Oh, no, we're stuck.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.708
Oh, this can't be happening.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.708
Not tonight.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.544
Well, look on the bright side.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.544
At least you're not alone.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.386
Help!

08:31.428 --> 08:33.388
Help!

08:36.391 --> 08:38.601
[instrumental music]

08:47.902 --> 08:50.280
Don't you know anything

08:47.902 --> 08:50.280
besides "Wipeout?"

08:50.322 --> 08:53.908
Oh, I'm sorry, Beck.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.908
Too much coffee. I'm sorry.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.745
Hey, guys, we can't find

08:53.950 --> 08:57.745
Uncle Jesse anywhere.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.706
Yeah, we tracked him

08:57.787 --> 08:59.706
as far as the kitchen

08:59.747 --> 09:03.001
then we lost the scent

08:59.747 --> 09:03.001
of his styling gel.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.253
Alright, well, don't worry.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.253
He'll be here.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
I mean, remember, this is

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
the man who went skydiving

09:07.422 --> 09:08.756
on our wedding day.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.925
He just handles pressure

09:08.798 --> 09:10.925
his own way.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.512
His own boneheaded way.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.307
Hey, hey, there's a whole lot

09:13.553 --> 09:17.307
of people lining up outside.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.767
It must be a fire drill.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.395
No, Michelle,

09:19.809 --> 09:21.395
th-those are our customers.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.230
We-we should have started

09:21.436 --> 09:23.230
ten minutes ago.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.316
I gotta figure out

09:23.271 --> 09:26.316
a way to make cappuccino.

09:26.358 --> 09:30.695
Alright.

09:26.358 --> 09:30.695
It's just you and me.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.947
Man versus machine.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.947
You keep in mind.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.409
I once kicked the crumbs

09:32.989 --> 09:35.409
out of an eight-slice toaster.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.077
[machine rattling]

09:37.118 --> 09:40.455
Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Okay.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.666
Hey, I was kidding, alright?

09:40.497 --> 09:43.666
I would never hurt an appliance.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.004
- 'Oh!'

09:46.002 --> 09:48.004
- Alright, D.J.

09:48.046 --> 09:51.049
You and Kimmy

09:48.046 --> 09:51.049
finish setting all the..

09:51.091 --> 09:53.051
- Where's Kimmy?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.051
- I don't know.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.761
I haven't seen her in a while.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.430
Maybe she's touching up

09:54.802 --> 09:56.430
her makeup.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.265
Any paint rollers missing?

09:59.558 --> 10:01.184
- Hey,

09:59.558 --> 10:01.184
- 'Oh, Joey, look.'

10:01.226 --> 10:03.437
We're gonna have to open

10:01.226 --> 10:03.437
with or without Jesse.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.188
- Is R.E.M. ready?

10:03.478 --> 10:05.188
- Oh, yeah.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.441
They're preparing just like

10:05.230 --> 10:07.441
any other rock group.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.151
They're making a quilt.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.446
Hey, guys. Guys,

10:10.193 --> 10:12.446
come on, what's the holdup?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.239
I brought a bunch

10:12.487 --> 10:14.239
of buddies from college.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.199
Well, I guess

10:14.281 --> 10:16.199
we better let them in.

10:16.241 --> 10:20.036
I just hope no one wants

10:16.241 --> 10:20.036
any coffee or entertainment.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.872
Hey, everybody, come on.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.872
Guys, come on in.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.041
Let's all get down front

10:22.914 --> 10:25.041
for R.E.M., okay?

10:25.083 --> 10:28.462
(all chanting)

10:25.083 --> 10:28.462
R.E.M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!

10:28.503 --> 10:31.631
R.E.M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!

10:31.672 --> 10:35.051
R. E. M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!

10:35.093 --> 10:38.388
'R.E.M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!'

10:40.307 --> 10:41.682
[clanking]

10:46.271 --> 10:48.565
Runnin' out of knives.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.650
Isn't this

10:48.607 --> 10:50.650
a crazy twist of fate?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.612
You and I

10:50.691 --> 10:53.612
stuck here like this?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.745
Aw, Kimmy, Kimmy, Kimmy.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.081
Look, Kim, I-I know

11:02.787 --> 11:05.081
over the years, you've, uh..

11:05.123 --> 11:10.795
...probably had a little,

11:05.123 --> 11:10.795
uh, crush on me.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.922
Get real, I meant,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.922
we're stuck here

11:12.964 --> 11:15.467
with all these chips,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.467
and no dip.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.471
I know that.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.182
See? That's what I'm saying.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.182
No dip.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.517
The way everybody's

11:22.223 --> 11:23.517
screwing up around here

11:23.558 --> 11:24.934
I'm probably

11:23.558 --> 11:24.934
out of business already.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.020
[banging]

11:24.976 --> 11:27.020
Help!

11:27.061 --> 11:29.063
What's-what's a "Smush Club?"

11:29.105 --> 11:31.441
That's what I'm talkin' about.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.441
Even the printer screwed up.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.943
I specifically wrote clear

11:31.483 --> 11:33.943
as day on the order form.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.446
- Smash Club.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.446
- Is this your handwriting?

11:36.488 --> 11:37.989
Of course, it's my handwriting.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.242
Yep, you're right, clear as day.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.242
Smush Club.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.747
Who gets the blame for that one,

11:42.869 --> 11:46.747
Mr. Perfect? The pen?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.916
Well, as a matter of fact, yes,

11:46.789 --> 11:48.916
I was using one of Joey's, uh

11:48.958 --> 11:50.960
Yogi, the bear pens.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.960
It was so cute.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.546
It was, uh, the thing

11:51.002 --> 11:52.546
with Ranger Smith.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.714
You turn it upside-down,

11:52.587 --> 11:55.714
and his pants fall down.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.551
Okay, so I made

11:55.756 --> 11:57.551
one small mistake.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.470
Ooh, so even

11:57.592 --> 12:00.470
the boss makes mistakes.

12:00.512 --> 12:04.765
I guess the napkin's on the

12:00.512 --> 12:04.765
other foot now, eh, mousse man?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.524
So I go to the doctor and I say,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.524
"Hey, doc, I have a headache."

12:12.566 --> 12:14.984
And he says,

12:12.566 --> 12:14.984
"Well, take off your clothes."

12:15.026 --> 12:17.153
So I say,

12:15.026 --> 12:17.153
"Will that stop my headache?"

12:17.195 --> 12:20.281
And he says, "No, I just

12:17.195 --> 12:20.281
hate what you're wearing."

12:20.323 --> 12:22.242
[Steve laughing]

12:23.284 --> 12:25.078
[clears throat]

12:25.119 --> 12:26.496
Yeah?

12:26.538 --> 12:29.499
How come your friends

12:26.538 --> 12:29.499
aren't, uh, laughing?

12:29.541 --> 12:32.043
Uh, well, I guess it's because

12:29.541 --> 12:32.043
they're all exchange students

12:32.085 --> 12:36.089
from Greenland

12:32.085 --> 12:36.089
and none of them speak English.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.550
Oh, that might have

12:36.130 --> 12:38.550
something to do with it.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.051
I guess. Yeah,

12:38.592 --> 12:40.051
but-but don't worry, okay?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.262
Because they'll go crazy

12:40.093 --> 12:42.262
when R.E.M. comes on.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.057
(all chanting)

12:42.303 --> 12:46.057
R.E.M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!

12:46.099 --> 12:49.852
R.E.M.! R.E.M.! R.E.M.!

12:49.894 --> 12:52.397
Your cafe latte

12:49.894 --> 12:52.397
is on the way.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.774
Um, your espresso,

12:52.439 --> 12:55.774
it's on the way.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.903
Whatever it was you ordered,

12:55.816 --> 12:58.903
it's on the way.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.447
[clinking glass]

13:00.488 --> 13:05.159
Miss, remember me, the

13:00.488 --> 13:05.159
cappuccino and the sticky bun?

13:06.869 --> 13:09.289
I'm sorry, sir,

13:06.869 --> 13:09.289
but it's not quite ready yet.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.541
Neither is this club

13:09.330 --> 13:11.541
and I intend to make that

13:11.583 --> 13:14.461
quite clear in my review.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.088
Review?

13:14.502 --> 13:17.088
Are you a critic?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.466
Elliott Warner,

13:17.130 --> 13:19.466
perhaps you're familiar

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
with my column,

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
Eating Out With Elliott.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.138
Yeah. I read it this morning.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.765
You said

13:25.179 --> 13:26.765
some pretty horrible things

13:26.805 --> 13:28.182
about that place

13:26.805 --> 13:28.182
on Market Street.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.144
Yes, well,

13:28.224 --> 13:31.144
mother lost her touch.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.983
- How is everything going here?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.983
- I'd like to see the owner.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.277
[chuckles]

13:37.024 --> 13:39.277
So would I.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.946
This club is a disgrace.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.074
Look, sir, it's opening night,

13:41.988 --> 13:45.074
and we're having a few problems.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.495
- A few?

13:45.116 --> 13:48.495
- Listen, buster.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.497
The owner is missing.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.497
We're a waitress short.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.206
All the instructions

13:50.538 --> 13:52.206
are in Italian.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.042
And not one person has said

13:52.248 --> 13:55.042
they like my dress.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.628
So if you're not happy here

13:56.670 --> 13:58.505
you can just take

13:56.670 --> 13:58.505
your ponytail, and--

13:58.546 --> 14:00.006
- Aunt Becky.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.006
- What?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.258
[whispering]

14:02.300 --> 14:04.927
[laughing]

14:02.300 --> 14:04.927
Mr. Warner.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.805
I hope you enjoyed

14:04.969 --> 14:06.805
that little scene

14:06.845 --> 14:09.683
from "Agnes, Hostess From Hell."

14:11.601 --> 14:12.893
It's part of a little

14:11.601 --> 14:12.893
theater group

14:12.935 --> 14:15.438
we have going here

14:12.935 --> 14:15.438
at the Smash Club.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.609
So please feel free to stick

14:15.480 --> 14:19.609
around for our second show.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.660
Look at these instructions. I

14:25.948 --> 14:28.660
should have studied engineering.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.039
Dad, we're dying out there.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.039
Where's the cappuccino?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.667
Somewhere

14:33.080 --> 14:35.667
inside this devil machine.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
[rattling]

14:37.418 --> 14:38.795
Hiss.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.841
Guys, we're in trouble,

14:40.463 --> 14:42.841
I just heard somebody say

14:42.882 --> 14:45.092
this is the worst service

14:42.882 --> 14:45.092
they've ever had.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.845
Was it that guy over there?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.556
No, it was this girl over here.

14:49.597 --> 14:54.060
I'm sorry but 15 minutes

14:49.597 --> 14:54.060
for milk is ridiculous.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.148
- Oh, that's it. I give up.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.148
- What do you mean, Joey?

14:59.190 --> 15:01.609
- You can't quit.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.609
- Well, you're right.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.987
