WEBVTT

00:06.380 --> 00:08.047
All right. Let's do an exercise.
If you could build anything

00:08.047 --> 00:09.213
in the world you want
with your compression,

00:09.547 --> 00:10.714
what's it gonna be?
Three, two, one, go.

00:10.714 --> 00:11.505
A new internet.

00:11.505 --> 00:12.797
What? Why?

00:15.213 --> 00:18.505
Gentlemen, our flight today
will be just over 11 hours.

00:18.505 --> 00:21.213
Oh, actually. I was headed up
to Jackson Hole,

00:21.213 --> 00:22.255
see the wife and kids.

00:22.714 --> 00:24.172
So I think maybe just
go to Jackson first,

00:24.172 --> 00:25.047
that sound good?

00:25.505 --> 00:26.714
Jack, I think
the company's needs

00:27.130 --> 00:29.255
are better suited
if I move you elsewhere.

00:29.756 --> 00:30.922
This is your desk.

00:32.756 --> 00:34.339
I'm going to start
my own company.

00:34.547 --> 00:36.630
And I think
the new CEO should be Dinesh,

00:36.630 --> 00:39.339
but I'm gonna have to insist
that I keep the name Pied Piper

00:39.339 --> 00:40.380
and I won't budge on that.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.547
-Yeah, that's totally fine.
-Okay. Who gives a shit?

00:42.547 --> 00:44.130
-That's fine.
-Terrible name.

00:44.464 --> 00:45.422
Let's get to work!

00:46.130 --> 00:48.297
So, wait,
I don't have to be CEO, right?

00:48.297 --> 00:49.255
Dinesh is gonna do that?

00:57.464 --> 01:01.172
So as you can see,
since I became the CEO,

01:01.172 --> 01:04.004
our user growth,
undeniable.

01:04.004 --> 01:08.297
Our retention, so sticky,
it's pornographic.

01:08.297 --> 01:10.589
We're lean,
we're exploding,

01:10.589 --> 01:12.589
and we're more
mission-focused than ever

01:12.589 --> 01:15.422
in providing
the best video chat

01:15.422 --> 01:18.922
the world has ever seen.

01:21.756 --> 01:24.756
Wow. Well, this seems
really promising, gentlemen.

01:24.756 --> 01:26.505
Promising, indeed.

01:26.505 --> 01:29.422
I think if each--
"Promising"?

01:29.422 --> 01:32.464
You're a young associate here,
so I'm gonna help you out, okay?

01:32.464 --> 01:35.380
We have a lot
of these meetings set up.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.881
We will be fine.

01:36.881 --> 01:39.255
What he means by that is...

01:39.255 --> 01:40.505
But you...

01:40.505 --> 01:42.172
you don't wanna
be known around here

01:42.172 --> 01:43.881
as the guy who
fucked this up, okay?

01:43.881 --> 01:46.130
So when you hip your bosses
to our numbers

01:46.130 --> 01:49.297
and they get visible hard-ons,
have them move quickly.

01:50.339 --> 01:52.505
Erlich, you're with me.

01:52.505 --> 01:55.255
-It's "hards-on."
-What?

01:55.255 --> 01:57.047
"Hards-on" not "hard-ons."

01:57.047 --> 01:59.422
It's a syntactical error
that I could've remedied

01:59.422 --> 02:01.130
if you had just given me
the space to speak.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.505
Erlich, seeing you
Thursday, right?

02:03.505 --> 02:04.922
You better believe it.

02:05.797 --> 02:08.213
Can't wait for it.
For, uh...

02:08.213 --> 02:11.505
For Jian-Yang's pitch.
His new idea sounds
super exciting.

02:11.505 --> 02:14.005
Yes, well, he is...
white hot right now.

02:14.005 --> 02:16.380
And that's why
I had him reach out directly,

02:16.380 --> 02:18.505
and we can't wait
to pitch you the idea

02:18.505 --> 02:19.963
that is gonna
be pitched to you.

02:19.963 --> 02:21.172
Great. I'll see you then.

02:22.672 --> 02:25.255
You have no idea
what it is, do you?
Not a fucking clue.

02:42.797 --> 02:45.922
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue!

02:45.922 --> 02:48.005
Always blue! Always blue!

02:48.005 --> 02:51.630
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue!

02:51.630 --> 02:53.505
Hey.
Always bl--

02:54.589 --> 02:55.922
Richard, hey.

02:55.922 --> 02:57.881
What's, uh...
Ah, there we go.

02:57.881 --> 03:00.714
What's going on?
You... celebrating something?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.589
We were just... chanting.

03:03.505 --> 03:05.380
Why? What,
the pitches go well?

03:05.380 --> 03:07.172
They went fine,
you could say.

03:07.172 --> 03:08.464
You said they went awesome.

03:08.464 --> 03:10.422
All right,
thank you, Big Head.

03:10.422 --> 03:14.339
I mean, I did get us
a... few offers.

03:14.339 --> 03:17.714
"We" did receive
more than a few offers,

03:17.714 --> 03:19.922
as "few" often refers
to three.

03:19.922 --> 03:22.005
And today,
we're four for four.

03:24.130 --> 03:27.047
Huh.
Which... I mean,
what does that even mean?

03:27.047 --> 03:28.963
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

03:28.963 --> 03:31.672
Look, you don't have
to do this.

03:31.672 --> 03:33.963
Really. It was my choice
to leave the company,

03:33.963 --> 03:36.672
and besides,
my Internet thing
is going great.

03:36.672 --> 03:38.547
Really, it's going very well.

03:38.547 --> 03:42.088
So I want you to succeed,
and I want you guys
to be happy.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.589
Sure you do, slugger.

03:43.589 --> 03:45.589
Stop. Really.

03:45.589 --> 03:48.380
It's cool.
I mean that,
totally honestly.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.797
Keep it positive.

03:49.797 --> 03:53.005
I should go Skype my dad,
I think, and tell him
the good news.

03:53.005 --> 03:56.422
Um, it is good news,
though, right?

03:56.422 --> 03:58.255
'Cause we were all sort of
like happy and celebrating,

03:58.255 --> 04:01.255
but now-- now it feels
sort of weird and--
Just go, Big Head.

04:01.255 --> 04:03.339
Okay. It's good?
Yes.

04:03.339 --> 04:05.881
All right.
Well... enjoy.

04:05.881 --> 04:07.797
Carry on.
Always blue.

04:09.756 --> 04:12.297
Jared.
Okay.

04:12.297 --> 04:14.464
- Always blue. Always blue.
- Sorry. Sorry.

04:14.464 --> 04:17.130
Dinesh, I think
you accidentally disabled
my access keys

04:17.130 --> 04:18.963
for the video chat
data repository.

04:18.963 --> 04:22.922
No, actually,
I deleted them
on purpose.

04:22.922 --> 04:25.547
I purged
all our ex-employees.

04:25.547 --> 04:27.505
Gleb, Sanjay,
Elisabet, you.

04:27.505 --> 04:29.756
Gleb? What,
you're comparing me to Gleb?

04:29.756 --> 04:32.339
When we agreed to split
the company, we said that

04:32.339 --> 04:34.130
you could take the algorithm
for your video chat,

04:34.130 --> 04:36.172
and I could use
the data flowing
through the system

04:36.172 --> 04:38.130
to optimize the algorithm
for my thing.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.630
We had a deal.
We had an agreement,

04:40.630 --> 04:42.839
not technically a deal.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.339
What the fuck,
Dinesh?

04:45.339 --> 04:47.213
Play! Play! Blue, blue!
Always blue! Always blue!

04:47.213 --> 04:49.213
Have fun, you're having a party.
You got pizza and everything.

04:49.213 --> 04:51.714
Always blue.
So, what? I should've got it
in writing, Dinesh? Is that it?

04:51.714 --> 04:54.756
You wanna lawyer up now?
You know, we're just
some guys in a house.

04:54.756 --> 04:57.047
But I don't wanna be
just guys in a house,
Richard.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.922
That's the whole point.
I want PiperChat to be
a real company.

05:00.922 --> 05:03.422
And after all the bullshit
we went through, no offense,

05:03.422 --> 05:05.922
I finally got
some real financing
lined up for us.

05:05.922 --> 05:07.881
I cannot have
another Intersite
on my hands.

05:07.881 --> 05:10.213
That was fucking Russ
and his shitty tequila.

05:10.213 --> 05:12.297
You know that, man?
You were there.
That wasn't me.

05:12.297 --> 05:15.172
Richard, it happened
on your watch.

05:16.172 --> 05:18.464
I'm sorry.
I really am.

05:19.756 --> 05:21.213
But the answer is no.

05:24.547 --> 05:27.130
Okay, well, suck a dick.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.630
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.088
Nice blazer.
Thank you.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.963
Where'd you get it?
Does it matter?

05:32.963 --> 05:34.756
I just want to know
where I can get one,

05:34.756 --> 05:36.672
so I can look like
a total fucking douchebag.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.213
Wow, right?

05:48.047 --> 05:49.088
Unbelievable.

05:49.088 --> 05:51.088
Gents, why don't
we take this...

05:51.088 --> 05:52.255
party outside?

05:52.255 --> 05:54.839
Yes, we live
in California.

05:54.839 --> 05:57.255
We should
take advantage of it.

05:57.255 --> 05:59.839
Oh... Okay.

06:06.130 --> 06:07.881
Gavin, you told me
to interrupt

06:07.881 --> 06:10.339
if Jack Barker came
to see you. I'm sorry.

06:10.339 --> 06:13.339
Yes. Send him in.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.839
I thought Barker would crack
after one day in that basement.

06:15.839 --> 06:17.756
The fact that it's taken him
two weeks to fess up

06:17.756 --> 06:21.172
about hijacking
my fucking plane
and resign

06:21.172 --> 06:23.047
will make it all the sweeter.

06:25.505 --> 06:26.756
Hiya, Skipper.

06:26.756 --> 06:30.172
Sorry to barge in.
I owe you an apology.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.213
Really?
Whatever for?

06:32.213 --> 06:35.130
When you stuck me
in that basement,

06:35.130 --> 06:39.297
I was like,
"Jack, what the hell
did you do wrong?"

06:39.297 --> 06:42.881
And I'm sorry that
it took me so long to get it
through my thick skull.

06:42.881 --> 06:45.672
I finally figured out
what this is all about.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.213
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

06:47.213 --> 06:51.088
You are doing exactly
what Bobby Iger does
over at Disney.

06:52.589 --> 06:53.714
What?

06:53.714 --> 06:55.422
He makes
every manager spend

06:55.422 --> 06:58.088
one day of the year
in the Goofy suit.

06:58.088 --> 07:01.213
Because sometimes,
you just gotta be
at product level

07:01.213 --> 07:03.422
to be able to see
the best path forward.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.422
And once I realized that,
it was like, ka-pow!

07:06.422 --> 07:09.505
It was so obvious.
It's the algorithm.

07:09.505 --> 07:12.088
Pied Piper put middle-out
in their vid chat,

07:12.088 --> 07:15.589
and it's amazing now, I know.
I'm on it all the time
with my grandkids.

07:15.589 --> 07:21.255
We could use
middle-out to revamp
our entire suite of products.

07:21.255 --> 07:23.130
We can make
billions, Chief.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.339
I'm whipping up
some proposals right now

07:25.339 --> 07:27.839
that are gonna knock that wig
right off your head.

07:30.297 --> 07:31.297
Yeah.

07:33.839 --> 07:35.672
What the fuck
is he up to?

07:40.464 --> 07:42.088
Look like
a fucking wig to you?

07:42.088 --> 07:44.464
The point is, Jian-Yang,
you don't set pitches.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.922
I handle the scheduling.
That's the symbiosis
of our relationship.

07:47.922 --> 07:50.339
No.
What do you mean, "no"?

07:50.339 --> 07:53.922
No.
Jian-Yang, PiperChat has
some real heat, okay?

07:53.922 --> 07:55.422
And we can draft off
of that,

07:55.422 --> 07:57.881
but it has to be a carefully
choreographed dance.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.672
You can't just wiggle
your little tush

07:59.672 --> 08:01.756
and expect every VC
in the Valley to get hards-on.

08:01.756 --> 08:04.881
I am your lead investor,
you will respect me as such.

08:04.881 --> 08:06.297
I do not respect you.

08:06.297 --> 08:09.922
You're not
any kind of investor.
You own nothing.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.172
I own 10 percent.
You live in my incubator.

08:12.172 --> 08:13.589
No, you evict me,

08:13.589 --> 08:16.881
I evict your 10 percent.
What are you talking about?

08:22.922 --> 08:25.005
"Santa Clara
Sheriff's Department.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.213
"Vacate
or be forcibly removed."

08:27.213 --> 08:30.963
To be fair, Jian-Yang, I filed
this when I had no expectations

08:30.963 --> 08:33.212
that the system
would work.
Okay.

08:33.212 --> 08:36.547
Jian-Yang, just tell me--
can you just tell me
what the idea is,

08:36.547 --> 08:38.922
so I can gauge
how aggressively
I should pursue it?

08:38.922 --> 08:40.797
Hey, Jared,
you were there, right?

08:40.797 --> 08:43.047
When we split
the company into two,

08:43.047 --> 08:45.630
Dinesh and I had a very--
Stop, stop. Please stop.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.380
Richard, what're you doing?
What? What?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.756
What do you mean?
I'm complaining about Dinesh.

08:49.756 --> 08:51.255
He-- He sucks.

08:51.255 --> 08:53.047
He's my boss now, Richard.

08:53.047 --> 08:55.380
Well, your boss
is being a real prick.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.380
Richard,
we have to bifurcate
our relationship.

08:58.380 --> 09:01.422
You and I can no longer
discuss business.
All right?

09:01.422 --> 09:04.922
We can-- We can talk
about anything else
two guys might talk about.

09:04.922 --> 09:09.963
We can talk about sports teams
and their scores, or pussy,

09:09.963 --> 09:13.922
but-- but you and I
cannot and will not
discuss business.

09:18.839 --> 09:20.630
Hey, man,
for what it's worth,

09:20.630 --> 09:23.756
I thought
it was super fucked up
what Dinesh did.

09:23.756 --> 09:26.255
I know what
it's like to be the one guy
not in the company.

09:26.255 --> 09:28.088
You know? So...

09:30.172 --> 09:32.922
If you want my log-in,
it's all yours.

09:34.422 --> 09:35.380
Really?

09:35.380 --> 09:36.756
Yeah, man.
Thanks.

09:38.255 --> 09:40.005
You know what?

09:40.005 --> 09:44.172
I shouldn't do this.
Dinesh said no.

09:44.172 --> 09:47.963
And also, these are
"Skyrim" cheat codes.
Oh, shit. Yeah.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.213
Hey, my Bloomberg
interview is on!

09:50.213 --> 09:52.464
How did I come up
with PiperChat?

09:52.464 --> 09:53.797
That's a very good question.

09:53.797 --> 09:56.213
I guess the tech gods
were just speaking
through me.

09:56.213 --> 09:59.672
Somehow, I knew to take
the best parts of a service

09:59.672 --> 10:04.130
as substandard and crappy
as HooliChat and make it--

10:04.130 --> 10:06.630
How do I put this?

10:07.714 --> 10:08.839
Incredible.

10:08.839 --> 10:10.839
Do you think I have
too much product in my hair?

10:10.839 --> 10:13.130
No, I think
you should use more.

10:13.130 --> 10:16.672
Wait. Are you saying that
because you think
I look ridiculous

10:16.672 --> 10:19.297
and you want me to look
more ridiculous next time?

10:19.297 --> 10:21.422
Which answer will get
more of that stuff
in your hair?

10:21.422 --> 10:22.839
...but let's just say...

10:22.839 --> 10:24.172
Wait, wait, wait.
Watch this.

10:24.172 --> 10:25.797
This is where I make
Emily Chang laugh.

10:25.797 --> 10:27.172
Quite a turnaround
for a company

10:27.172 --> 10:28.797
that wasn't
exactly soaring.

10:28.797 --> 10:30.380
Oh, it was soaring, Emily...

10:30.380 --> 10:32.339
right into
a clogged toilet.

10:32.339 --> 10:35.088
And not just like
a standard clogged toilet.

10:35.088 --> 10:36.922
Like, I don't need
a plunger.

10:36.922 --> 10:39.172
I need a shovel
and a bucket.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.505
But enough about
the previous leadership,

10:41.505 --> 10:44.088
which was inept,
lame, bitter...

10:44.088 --> 10:46.839
♪ ♪Fuck him.
We had a deal.

10:49.130 --> 10:50.297
Thanks.

11:01.255 --> 11:02.881
That's weird.

11:05.088 --> 11:06.505
Hey, Richard.

11:06.505 --> 11:09.213
Have you seen
the new Sports Illustrated
swimsuit edition?

11:09.213 --> 11:13.839
The cover model
has the most lovely,
enigmatic facial expression.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.047
Jared, I--
I don't really want
to talk about guy talk.

11:16.047 --> 11:19.464
I'm here to tell you
that I think Dinesh may be
in some serious trouble.

11:19.464 --> 11:22.005
Okay, so I was analyzing
a bunch of user data,

11:22.005 --> 11:24.714
and I noticed--
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Richard. Richard.

11:24.714 --> 11:27.922
I told you,
I can't talk about this.
You have to bifurcate.

11:27.922 --> 11:29.630
No, Jared, listen,
you're gonna wanna hear this.

11:29.630 --> 11:32.797
Wait. What do
you mean you were looking
at user data?

11:32.797 --> 11:36.297
You violated our system?
Richard, you were inside us?

11:36.297 --> 11:38.963
Don't tell Dinesh,
and don't tell any
of the other guys, okay?

11:38.963 --> 11:42.464
"Don't tell Dinesh"?
Richard, Dinesh is my CEO.

11:42.464 --> 11:44.547
Oh, God.
What are
you doing to me?

11:44.547 --> 11:46.922
Did I make you angry?

11:46.922 --> 11:49.380
I'm trying
to save his ass, okay?
I'm trying to save you.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.881
Just survey
the users...

11:51.881 --> 11:54.922
and make sure you ask
how old they are.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.255
Okay? And then, that's it.
That's it. That's it. No more.

12:00.422 --> 12:03.172
Stupid fucking Jian-Yang
and his shitty app.

12:03.172 --> 12:04.756
I don't even know
if it is shitty.

12:04.756 --> 12:07.672
Hey, you know,
I could probably find out
about Jian-Yang's app.

12:07.672 --> 12:10.339
He asked if he could
practice-pitch it to me.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.255
Do you have any nines?
Go fish.

12:12.255 --> 12:15.005
Wait. This could be great.
What time are you guys
doing that?

12:15.005 --> 12:17.172
I could listen in.
I don't know.

12:17.172 --> 12:20.005
He asked
if he could pitch me,
and I said sure,

12:20.005 --> 12:23.047
and then he kind of
just like kept talking
for a while.

12:23.047 --> 12:24.380
Oh.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.047
You don't think
that could've been
the pitch, do you?

12:28.088 --> 12:29.630
God damn it,
what did he say?

12:29.630 --> 12:32.422
Geez,
I kind of zoned out.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.255
Shit. Fives?

12:34.255 --> 12:36.547
Uh, go fish.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.047
Wait. I don't know
if this would be relevant,

12:39.047 --> 12:41.630
but he did say
the word "Oculus"
a whole bunch.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.172
Wait. "Oculus"?
Mm-hmm.

12:45.172 --> 12:48.672
Oh, my God.
It's a VR play.

12:48.672 --> 12:51.464
That's the frothiest space
in the Valley right now.

12:51.464 --> 12:53.881
Nobody understands it,
but everybody wants in.

12:53.881 --> 12:56.339
Any idiot can walk
into a fucking room,

12:56.339 --> 13:00.172
utter the letters "V" and "R,"
and VCs will hurl bricks
of cash at him.

13:00.172 --> 13:03.130
Then by the time
they find out that
it's vaporware, it's too late.

13:04.505 --> 13:07.797
I have got...
to get in on this.

13:13.297 --> 13:17.213
Trust me. Just give me
five minutes. There he is.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.130
Hey!
Wait. Is that our lawyer?

13:20.130 --> 13:23.589
Hey!
I thought
he was in jail.

13:23.589 --> 13:25.589
Hey. Perfect timing.

13:25.589 --> 13:29.130
I just completed
the detailing on this Kia.

13:29.130 --> 13:32.213
Come on.
What the fuck
is going on?

13:32.213 --> 13:35.339
Wait. I don't understand.
How did Richard have access
to our user data?

13:35.339 --> 13:37.088
Someone
must've let him in.

13:37.088 --> 13:40.130
It was you.
You're a fucking rat, Jared.

13:40.130 --> 13:42.130
Richard entered us
without consent.

13:42.130 --> 13:45.172
In spite of that,
he has raised
a real issue here.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.797
Fuck this.
I'm gonna Uber home.

13:46.797 --> 13:50.172
Mr. Monahan,
good luck with this whole
work-release situation,

13:50.172 --> 13:52.505
but I have more
important things to do.

13:52.505 --> 13:54.172
Mr. Chugtai.

13:54.172 --> 13:59.339
It appears that
33 percent of your users
are under the age of 13.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.380
It's also apparent
that you have

14:01.380 --> 14:05.505
no parental permission
requirements in place.

14:05.505 --> 14:09.088
You're going to want
to sit down for this.

14:18.213 --> 14:21.714
Are you familiar
with COPPA?
Who?

14:21.714 --> 14:25.380
That's the Children's Online
Privacy and Protection Act.

14:25.380 --> 14:29.047
This Act establishes
strict guidelines

14:29.047 --> 14:30.922
to protect the privacy

14:30.922 --> 14:32.797
of younger children
on the Internet.

14:32.797 --> 14:36.213
You are
in gross violation
of this act.

14:36.213 --> 14:40.088
You know how kids
can't have a YouTube
or Facebook account

14:40.088 --> 14:43.005
till they're 13?
It's because of this.

14:43.005 --> 14:46.922
Yes, but our users are
chatting with each other, Jared,

14:46.922 --> 14:48.213
not some old creep.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.130
No offense.
None taken.

14:51.130 --> 14:54.297
My shame will linger
even after my voting rights
are restored.

14:54.297 --> 14:59.881
Now, are there
records of these chats
on your server?

14:59.881 --> 15:01.422
Yeah, we store
everything.

15:01.422 --> 15:05.297
What-- Okay.
What's going on?
How serious is this?

15:05.297 --> 15:08.297
Each violation
of COPPA...

15:09.213 --> 15:13.130
carries a penalty
of $16,000.

15:13.130 --> 15:15.714
So we're fined $16,000?

15:15.714 --> 15:19.088
Oh, no.
I hope they take cash.

15:19.088 --> 15:21.505
$16,000 per user.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.589
Not only each user...

15:24.756 --> 15:26.172
each use.

15:32.339 --> 15:35.255
Fifty-one thousand
estimated underage users

15:35.255 --> 15:38.839
times an average
25.6 chat sessions per user

15:38.839 --> 15:41.797
times $16,000...

15:45.672 --> 15:48.172
$21 billion?

15:48.172 --> 15:51.589
I mean, how is that
even fucking possible?

15:53.088 --> 15:55.589
I mean, I knew Dinesh was
going to fuck this all up,

15:55.589 --> 15:59.297
but honestly,
this couldn't get
any better.

16:00.547 --> 16:02.297
What's with the shirt?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.172
Oh, he sort of became ill
on himself.

16:07.797 --> 16:10.714
I was wrong.
This just got better.

16:10.714 --> 16:12.297
This is all
your fault, Richard.

16:12.297 --> 16:14.963
This was your company
before it was mine.

16:14.963 --> 16:16.380
What are
you talking about?

16:16.380 --> 16:18.088
Dinesh, I specifically
reminded you

16:18.088 --> 16:20.297
to port over
the terms of service
from the platform.

16:20.297 --> 16:23.547
Right, and I asked
if you'd done it, and--
and you said you had.

16:23.547 --> 16:28.297
Okay. I checked
the TOS box when I submitted
to the app store,

16:28.297 --> 16:30.589
but then I didn't end up
doing it, all right?

16:30.589 --> 16:32.005
And then
when we caught fire,

16:32.005 --> 16:33.714
the last thing
I wanted to do

16:33.714 --> 16:36.756
was bog our users down
with legal bullshit,
you know?

16:36.756 --> 16:39.005
I mean, nobody reads
that stuff anyway.

16:39.005 --> 16:41.756
Well, first of all,
everyone reads
the terms of service,

16:41.756 --> 16:45.963
and secondly,
they would've given us
legal cover from exactly this.

16:45.963 --> 16:49.505
Every sound is $16,000.

16:50.505 --> 16:51.714
Fuck!

16:51.714 --> 16:53.172
All right, all right.
Don't think about that.

16:53.172 --> 16:56.589
Just think about how to solve
this massive, massive problem.

16:56.589 --> 16:59.088
Quickly.

17:00.172 --> 17:02.547
Quick as you can.
Jared! Just...

17:04.297 --> 17:06.547
Wait. We could shut down.

17:06.547 --> 17:10.213
No, no, no.
Not when we're this close
to signing a term sheet.

17:10.213 --> 17:12.547
And in case all of you gents
have forgotten,

17:12.547 --> 17:15.672
I'm on the hook
for half a million clambos
for this thing.

17:15.672 --> 17:19.213
But we can't stay online!
We're just racking up
more fines!

17:19.213 --> 17:21.547
Well, technically,
this is a corporation.

17:21.547 --> 17:23.380
So whatever
they fine you,

17:23.380 --> 17:26.297
they'll really
only be able to collect
what the company's worth,

17:26.297 --> 17:28.714
which at this point,
is basically nothing.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.380
That's right.
I'm just the CEO.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.172
I'm not personally liable.

17:33.172 --> 17:34.547
Although...

17:34.547 --> 17:37.088
Although what?

17:37.088 --> 17:40.963
Well, when you lied to me
about adding terms of service,

17:40.963 --> 17:43.213
it could be argued
you violated

17:43.213 --> 17:45.589
your fiduciary duty
to the company,

17:45.589 --> 17:47.630
rendering you
personally liable.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.756
I mean, if the FTC
brought us to trial,

17:49.756 --> 17:51.756
I could be compelled
to testify against you.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.130
Jared, I trusted you.

17:54.130 --> 17:56.255
Oh, trust has nothing
to do with it,

17:56.255 --> 17:58.422
but thanks
for making that official.

17:59.464 --> 18:01.756
So I could be personally liable

18:01.756 --> 18:04.589
for $21 billion?

18:04.589 --> 18:06.422
Yeah, most likely.

18:06.422 --> 18:09.213
I know, in the fable,
Pied Piper led all the children

18:09.213 --> 18:11.422
into darkness,
but now we're doing it.

18:11.422 --> 18:13.630
So, what do you wanna do?

18:15.672 --> 18:17.672
I'm gonna throw up again.

18:17.672 --> 18:19.505
I'm going to watch this.

18:21.047 --> 18:23.797
I want full surveillance
on Jack Barker, 24/7.

18:23.797 --> 18:26.464
I don't recommend
using conventional
listening devices.

18:26.464 --> 18:27.630
He may sweep
for those.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.464
I do have a colleague
at Facebook that has

18:29.464 --> 18:31.088
a laser microphone.
You can point it

18:31.088 --> 18:32.797
at an office window
from a mile away

18:32.797 --> 18:34.505
and read
the sound vibrations.

18:34.505 --> 18:36.130
I like it.

18:36.130 --> 18:39.172
Hoover, you're
the only person I can trust
at this goddamn company.

18:39.172 --> 18:41.088
It's good
to have a friend.

18:41.088 --> 18:42.297
I understand that, sir.

18:42.297 --> 18:46.088
Ah! Gavin, there you are.

18:46.088 --> 18:49.672
Oh. I don't want
to interrupt your talking
with Hoover...

18:49.672 --> 18:52.130
and talking and talking
about things,

18:52.130 --> 18:55.047
but I have
some concrete news.

18:55.047 --> 18:57.422
Regarding?
Jack Barker.

18:57.422 --> 19:00.172
By forgoing
Western gadgetry,

19:00.172 --> 19:03.839
simply stationing myself
in the hall outside
of his office,

19:03.839 --> 19:06.339
I was able to
overhear him speaking

19:06.339 --> 19:09.005
of his plans
to move against you.

19:09.005 --> 19:13.339
He even referred to you
as "Gavin... Smellson."

19:13.339 --> 19:16.464
I knew it!
Good work, Denpok.

19:16.464 --> 19:19.839
Good work. Let's go slice
this bastard in half, huh?

19:19.839 --> 19:22.339
Hold on.
We need proof.

19:22.339 --> 19:23.672
Otherwise,
he'll just deny it,

19:23.672 --> 19:26.088
and it'll just be a case
of he said/she said.

19:26.088 --> 19:29.213
That's a good point.
Denpok, who was
he talking to?

19:30.505 --> 19:32.380
Oh, um...

19:32.380 --> 19:35.380
Alas, I could not see this
from my hidden vantage point.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.756
I'll check the logs and see
who was in his office.

19:37.756 --> 19:39.088
No, because...

19:41.797 --> 19:43.088
no one was there.

19:44.005 --> 19:47.130
I'm confused.
Was he on the phone?

19:47.130 --> 19:50.172
Yes. Very perceptive.

19:50.172 --> 19:53.047
Easy. I'll just pull up
his phone records.
No.

19:54.339 --> 19:55.797
Not the phone phone.

19:55.797 --> 19:58.422
So what was he doing?
Was he video chatting?

19:58.422 --> 20:00.922
That's what
it was, chela.

20:00.922 --> 20:04.047
Even better.
I'll pull up the chat data.

20:04.047 --> 20:05.505
You can do that?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.505
Well, as long
as he was on HooliChat,

20:07.505 --> 20:12.130
but the bastard
kept grinding in my face
how much he loved PiperChat.

20:12.130 --> 20:15.380
What if he was using...
PiperChat. Yes.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.589
Fuck!
He said
the resolution was

20:17.589 --> 20:20.505
so vivid and superior
to HooliChat.

20:20.505 --> 20:24.297
Ah. Sadly,
now we'll never know

20:24.297 --> 20:29.255
the identity
of the person with whom
he was definitely talking.

20:31.088 --> 20:33.255
Unless...
Unless what?

20:37.255 --> 20:38.589
Dinesh?

20:48.088 --> 20:49.255
Hey, man.

20:51.172 --> 20:52.297
How's it going?

20:53.589 --> 20:54.922
Bad.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.255
Well, look,
I've been there, man.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.005
No, you haven't.
No, I-- I have.

21:01.088 --> 21:04.130
One time when
we were pitching
at Ross Loma...

21:05.130 --> 21:07.297
I threw up
in my pants.

21:09.047 --> 21:10.380
Don't you mean "on"?

21:10.380 --> 21:13.922
No. No, I mean--
I mean "in."

21:15.797 --> 21:19.714
We were pitching and...
well, things weren't
really going well,

21:19.714 --> 21:21.339
I was getting nervous and--
I don't know,

21:21.339 --> 21:23.464
I think I must've eaten
something bad that day.

21:23.464 --> 21:26.339
Anyway, my stomach
was upside down, so I made
a beeline to the stall.

21:26.339 --> 21:30.714
But then I pulled down
my pants, sat down...

21:30.714 --> 21:34.088
but instead of shit,
I threw up... into my pants.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.505
Well, I was CEO
for 11 days,

21:40.505 --> 21:43.005
and in that time
I violated the rights

21:43.005 --> 21:45.005
of 50,000 little girls,

21:45.005 --> 21:47.422
exposed them
to sexual predators,

21:47.422 --> 21:51.339
and racked up fines the size
of a small nation's GDP.

21:53.213 --> 21:56.213
Yeah. I threw up
in my pants.

21:58.339 --> 21:59.547
Fuck.

22:01.464 --> 22:03.172
What do I do,
Richard?

22:04.255 --> 22:06.589
There are
no right answers.

22:06.589 --> 22:08.963
You know,
when I was CEO...

22:10.339 --> 22:12.547
I found that it was
more about choosing

22:12.547 --> 22:15.047
the one wrong answer
that you can live with.

22:17.005 --> 22:19.005
I really loved
that video chat.

22:24.714 --> 22:25.714
Hello.

22:26.714 --> 22:27.839
This is he.

22:29.213 --> 22:30.589
What?

22:30.589 --> 22:32.047
It's Gavin Belson.

22:32.047 --> 22:34.339
It's Gavin fucking Belson.

22:34.339 --> 22:36.422
Hey, Gavin Belson.

22:38.172 --> 22:40.339
What's up?
Oh, my God.

22:40.339 --> 22:42.547
We're crushing it
all the time.

22:42.547 --> 22:44.047
I'm in a bathtub.

22:45.547 --> 22:49.922
Yeah, of course.
I'd love to. Bye.

22:49.922 --> 22:52.672
He wants to meet me
at Josephina's tonight.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.213
Did I say yes?

22:56.547 --> 22:57.672
Holy shit.

22:57.672 --> 23:00.714
Gavin Belson wants
to acquire PiperChat.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.963
He made
the same call to me
back when he wanted

23:02.963 --> 23:04.756
to make an offer
for Pied Piper.

23:04.756 --> 23:07.088
He could take
this entire shitbomb

23:07.088 --> 23:09.464
off Dinesh's hands?
Where's the fun in that?

23:09.464 --> 23:12.672
More importantly,
I could get all my money back,
maybe even more.

23:12.672 --> 23:14.839
We could 10X
this motherfucker, gents.

23:14.839 --> 23:16.922
Although...
Although what?

23:16.922 --> 23:19.213
Well, I'm sorry to play
the Cassandra again,

23:19.213 --> 23:21.630
but Dinesh can't sell
Gavin the company.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.172
Why not?
Why the fuck not?

23:23.172 --> 23:26.589
It's due diligence.
Gavin doesn't trust anyone.

23:26.589 --> 23:28.922
When I worked for him,
he tried to microchip me.

23:28.922 --> 23:31.380
Before he finalized
any acquisition,

23:31.380 --> 23:33.881
his legal team would uncover
our malfeasance.

23:33.881 --> 23:36.130
They'd sniff out
the user issue immediately.

23:36.130 --> 23:39.088
And they'd
probably turn you in,
and you do not want that.

23:39.088 --> 23:40.756
I mean, there's also
the moral quandary.

23:40.756 --> 23:42.464
Even if he could
get away with it,

23:42.464 --> 23:45.005
could Dinesh
really sell the company,
knowing it's basically

23:45.005 --> 23:47.630
a Sizzler buffet
for the sexually deranged?

23:47.630 --> 23:51.714
Of course he could.
Because even if there is
a one percent chance of success

23:51.714 --> 23:55.088
and a 99 percent chance
of failure and prison,

23:55.088 --> 23:59.088
he will do the right thing
and get me my money back.

24:00.714 --> 24:03.255
I'm sorry, Erlich.
I've made my decision.

24:03.255 --> 24:05.380
I'm gonna say no
to Gavin Belson...

24:05.380 --> 24:07.672
shut it down,
and just see what happens.

24:11.255 --> 24:14.339
What the fuck, huh?
What the fuck?

24:15.464 --> 24:16.963
Jian-Yang!

24:26.213 --> 24:27.963
Hey, Gavin.

24:27.963 --> 24:29.464
Well...
Dinesh.

24:30.839 --> 24:32.005
Thanks for coming.

24:34.088 --> 24:37.255
Listen, Gavin.
I've thought about it,

24:37.255 --> 24:39.797
and if this is about
you buying PiperChat--

24:39.797 --> 24:42.130
I didn't come here today
to buy your company.

24:42.130 --> 24:43.505
You didn't?

24:43.505 --> 24:45.881
No. I came to take it.

24:45.881 --> 24:47.839
I thought
I'd have to buy you out,

24:47.839 --> 24:50.172
and I wanted
to know what kind of CEO
I'd be dealing with,

24:50.172 --> 24:53.213
so I had my comms people
pull your press,

24:53.213 --> 24:55.380
like this interview you did
with TechCrunch

24:55.380 --> 24:58.589
where you described PiperChat
as, and I quote,

24:58.589 --> 25:00.756
"Exactly like HooliChat,

25:00.756 --> 25:04.839
"but without
the suck-ass parts,"
end quote.

25:04.839 --> 25:06.714
Or the one you did
with Emily Chang,

25:06.714 --> 25:10.505
where you told her how you took
"the best parts of HooliChat

25:10.505 --> 25:13.797
"and made them less crappy."

25:13.797 --> 25:17.380
I was about to throw you
a massive acquisition deal,

25:17.380 --> 25:22.756
and then I realized you'd
already publicly admitted
to stealing my IP.

25:24.005 --> 25:25.422
I hope you have
a good lawyer.

25:25.422 --> 25:27.213
He works at the car wash
down the street.

25:27.213 --> 25:28.380
What?

25:28.380 --> 25:31.714
Look, Gavin,
you do not want
to do this.

25:31.714 --> 25:34.255
I can't explain
exactly why.
Shut up.

25:36.464 --> 25:38.464
This is not a negotiation.

25:38.464 --> 25:40.714
If you fight me,
I will win,

25:40.714 --> 25:43.714
and I will fuck you
in the tech business forever.

25:43.714 --> 25:45.589
No one will hire you.

25:45.589 --> 25:48.172
I'm taking PiperChat.
By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow,

25:48.172 --> 25:50.963
you will hand over to Hooli
all your data and systems.

25:50.963 --> 25:53.797
All your users
will be converted
to HooliChat users.

25:53.797 --> 25:56.088
It will be like
PiperChat never existed.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.589
And what you get out of it
is the chance to walk away

25:58.589 --> 26:01.130
and try and get another job
in this town.

26:01.130 --> 26:03.380
You have five seconds
to decide.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.464
Five, four...
Okay.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.464
So we're in agreement.

26:08.464 --> 26:11.172
For a 10 percent stake
in your current venture,

26:11.172 --> 26:13.756
you will receive
full pool privileges,

26:13.756 --> 26:17.922
more room in the crisper,
and you may live
in my home for...

26:17.922 --> 26:19.464
For free.

26:19.464 --> 26:20.756
...for free
for six months.

26:20.756 --> 26:22.922
Fuck you.
One year.

26:24.756 --> 26:27.464
Fuck!
Fine. Fine.

26:27.464 --> 26:30.963
It's a deal.
Deal.

26:30.963 --> 26:35.714
Jian, I mean,
your onerous terms
not withstanding,

26:35.714 --> 26:39.630
I'm very excited to be
a part of your VR play.

26:39.630 --> 26:40.839
VR?

26:40.839 --> 26:43.297
VR, virtual reality.
Who's doing VR?

26:43.297 --> 26:45.714
You are.
That's what Big Head said.

26:45.714 --> 26:47.630
This play has to do
with the Oculus, right?

26:47.630 --> 26:50.255
No.
But he said
that you said, "Oculus."

26:50.255 --> 26:53.130
He said you kept saying it.
"Oculus, Oculus, Oculus."

26:53.130 --> 26:54.422
Octopus.

26:56.422 --> 26:57.630
No.

26:59.130 --> 27:00.339
No.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.630
Octopus?
It's a water animal.

27:04.630 --> 27:07.505
I-- I know
what an octopus is.

27:07.505 --> 27:11.255
Just-- What does
your application have
to do with octopus?

27:11.255 --> 27:16.380
Eight different ways to make
a Chinese recipe, octopus.

27:20.088 --> 27:23.130
So I just traded
one year...

27:23.130 --> 27:25.714
of free rent,
full pool privileges,

27:25.714 --> 27:27.339
and more room
in the crisper

27:27.339 --> 27:30.839
for an application
that is just...

27:32.172 --> 27:35.047
eight recipes
for octopus?

27:35.047 --> 27:36.839
Hmm?
Yes.

27:39.630 --> 27:41.005
Hey, guys, they're ready.

27:44.464 --> 27:47.505
Ooh. Ooh.

27:47.505 --> 27:49.005
What the fuck is this?

27:49.005 --> 27:51.339
I went through
every chat in his history.

27:52.255 --> 27:53.422
They're all the same.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.839
Perhaps it was
another chat format.

27:56.839 --> 28:01.005
Could you acquire
Skype or FaceTime
and check them as well?

28:01.005 --> 28:01.963
What?

28:01.963 --> 28:04.088
Uh, Gavin,
I'm-- I'm sorry.

28:04.088 --> 28:07.505
I need to talk to you about
this PiperChat acquisition.

28:07.505 --> 28:10.630
I put together a panel
of the most active users

28:10.630 --> 28:12.047
you ported over
from PiperChat.

28:12.047 --> 28:14.047
Bear in mind, this group
is representative

28:14.047 --> 28:16.797
in terms of gender, race

28:16.797 --> 28:19.047
and, most importantly, age.

28:19.047 --> 28:20.881
Now, who else
thinks changing

28:20.881 --> 28:23.756
to a HooliChat log-in
is hella lame?

28:25.213 --> 28:27.213
Madison, Allison, Jennifer,

28:27.213 --> 28:30.213
Stephanie, Quinn,
Ingrid, Kaylee...

28:30.213 --> 28:32.881
Oh, no.
...Amber, Sarah,
Janelle...

28:32.881 --> 28:36.589
Carl. Now, Carl...

28:36.589 --> 28:40.297
you said
the new sign-in page
made you nervous.

28:40.297 --> 28:42.047

Right, Jared?

30:00.380 --> 30:03.505
I once saw him throw a sloth
down a flight of stairs.

30:03.505 --> 30:05.339
He said it was an accident,
but he had this look

30:05.339 --> 30:07.714
in his eyes...
I-- I can't rule it out.

30:09.255 --> 30:11.047
Crazy people
like Richard Hendricks

30:11.047 --> 30:13.922
babbling about technical issues
that he can't solve.

30:13.922 --> 30:15.172
You know, all the guys
at the house,

30:15.339 --> 30:16.672
they think I'm nuts.
But I'm not nuts.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.339
Hey, you know they say
that after Alan Turing

30:18.672 --> 30:21.005
was chemically castrated,
he got a lot less annoying.

30:21.547 --> 30:24.505
-What was that?
-Hmm? Nothing.
