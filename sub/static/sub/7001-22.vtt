01:13.870 --> 01:19.969
You know, all this week, Al and I have done
our <i>Tool Time</i> salute to painting.

01:21.989 --> 01:26.060
And I got to thinking about
something a little disjointed.

01:26.150 --> 01:29.580
Women have been telling me
that they think men are insensitive.

01:29.669 --> 01:32.019
That we don't listen.
Boy, that really irks me.

01:32.110 --> 01:33.820
- How about you, Al?
- Well, Tim, I think…

01:33.909 --> 01:38.419
Exactly my point, Al. You know,
men are sensitive to other things.

01:38.509 --> 01:42.659
for instance, when a woman sees
a hot rod, what does she see? A car.

01:42.749 --> 01:46.019
When a man sees a hot rod
he sees all the love and care

01:46.110 --> 01:48.409
that it took to make the details
of the hot rod.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.459
To illustrate my point.
I've invited a good friend of mine.

01:51.550 --> 01:54.419
Fred Axelby, from Axelby's
Street Rods, down here on the show.

01:54.509 --> 01:58.050
He's actually the one who motivated
me to build my own hot rod.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.699
Let's get him out here
with a big <i>Tool Time</i> welcome.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.219
Lisa, bring him on out.
A big hand. Come on.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.979
- Here you go, Tim.
- Thank you, Lisa.

02:08.070 --> 02:10.699
- Fred, good to have you here.
- Great to be here, Tim. Great to be here.

02:10.789 --> 02:13.540
Good deal, All right, what are we gonna do
on the next show?

02:13.630 --> 02:19.259
Well, Tim, first we're going to apply
120 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer.

02:19.350 --> 02:22.939
Do you suppose a fender has
120 coats cos it's cold?

02:26.150 --> 02:31.739
- I really doubt it, Tim.
- Well, it sounds like a lot of work, though.

02:31.830 --> 02:36.179
Oh, it is, Tim. But it's worth it
if you're a real detail man.

02:36.269 --> 02:38.650
Details.
See, it's exactly my point.

02:38.749 --> 02:41.780
Ah, well, there…
there is one detail, Tim.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.979
Al, we don't have any more
time for details.

02:44.070 --> 02:47.850
Join me next time
when we put this fender back…

02:49.310 --> 02:51.659
Yeah, we just put
that primer on backstage.

02:51.749 --> 02:54.979
- Was that the detail, Al?
- Yes, it was, Tim.

02:55.070 --> 02:58.259
Well, anyway, thanks for being with us.
I'm Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.860
hoping all your lacquer finishes
are glossy. See ya next time.

03:05.709 --> 03:08.300
You know, Tim, a little thinner
will take that right off.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.739
- Great. Good night, Lisa.
- Listen. I've got some bad news.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.860
Murray called. He can't make
the poker game tonight.

03:14.949 --> 03:18.259
Oh, no. We can't play
with three men.

03:18.350 --> 03:22.259
- Well, maybe we should call it off.
- No. We're not calling it off.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.300
I don't care if I have to drag
some idiot off the street.

03:24.390 --> 03:27.929
- Excuse me, Tim.
- Al! Hey.

03:28.030 --> 03:29.380
- Yeah?
- Um…

03:29.469 --> 03:32.979
We need a fourth player for our poker
game tonight. Do you wanna join us?

03:33.070 --> 03:35.900
Oh. I haven't played
in about ten years.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.540
Perfect.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.620
Why don't you come over
about 7:30 then?

03:41.709 --> 03:43.659
OK. Who's playing?

03:43.749 --> 03:46.580
Well, it'll be Fred, myself, you,
and Charlie, my brother-in-law.

03:46.669 --> 03:49.050
- I think you've met him.
- Just the guys, huh?

03:49.150 --> 03:52.019
- You bet.
- OK, well, what should I wear?

03:55.509 --> 03:58.499
Well, Al, I can't speak for
Fred or Charlie.

03:58.590 --> 04:03.060
but I'd like to see you
in something simple yet revealing.

04:03.949 --> 04:06.380
- What you're saying is it doesn't matter.
- That's what I'm saying, Al.

04:06.469 --> 04:08.739
- Unless you get an evening dress…
- I'll see you at 7:30.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.820
OK, buddy.

04:11.790 --> 04:15.100
Oh, that smells!

04:15.630 --> 04:18.300
- Do we have to eat it?
- No, honey.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.259
This isn't food. I'm gonna give myself
a facial tonight before I go to bed.

04:21.350 --> 04:25.219
- Will you stir this for me? Hi.
- Hi. I got everything I need.

04:25.310 --> 04:30.300
Chips, soda, all ready for
that poker game. Whoa!

04:30.390 --> 04:32.739
- Looks like your mom made some dip.
- Don't eat that!

04:32.830 --> 04:35.419
I know. It's for the company.

04:46.669 --> 04:49.229
Is that your mother's recipe?

04:51.630 --> 04:55.100
No. It's not a dip.
It's an organic face mask.

04:58.870 --> 05:01.820
See, what I do is. I put this in
the refrigerator for a little while.

05:01.909 --> 05:04.179
and then when I put it on my face
it makes it all pretty and tight.

05:04.269 --> 05:08.860
It looks just like this.
Hi, everybody. I'm so beautiful.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.780
Hey, Mom, can Brad and I
stay home tonight?

05:12.870 --> 05:16.179
No. It's poker night.
Men only. No children.

05:16.269 --> 05:20.580
But Dad, Mom and Aunt Robin want to
take us to an arts and crafts fair.

05:20.669 --> 05:22.780
Great. That's a good thing to do.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.699
Men's handiwork,
craftsmen, men, wood…

05:25.790 --> 05:27.939
- You'll love it.
- Aw, man.

05:28.030 --> 05:30.590
Well, Tim, if the boys don't want to go,
maybe we should just all stay home.

05:30.669 --> 05:35.380
No! When your sister gets here,
she goes. Charlie stays.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.060
- It's a man's night tonight.
- "Man's night."

05:38.150 --> 05:41.060
Yeah. Man's night. Cigars, smoke,

05:41.150 --> 05:46.380
scratching parts of you, burping,
body noises without any kind of apology.

05:46.469 --> 05:49.699
"Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry. I fluffed."

05:50.269 --> 05:53.659
How is that different from
any other night?

05:54.469 --> 05:57.620
Well, there'll be other men
doing it with me.

05:59.509 --> 06:04.019
I'll get it. Charlie, open your wallet
right now, cos I got the…

06:04.110 --> 06:06.489
Hi. Robin, Where's Charlie?

06:06.590 --> 06:10.130
Last time I saw my husband he was
on the corner of Fulton and fourth.

06:10.229 --> 06:11.209
Why?

06:11.310 --> 06:15.179
He said he'd rather walk than let me drive
so I took off without him.

06:15.269 --> 06:17.380
We were supposed to play
poker tonight.

06:17.469 --> 06:20.300
Tim, I think she's upset.

06:20.390 --> 06:23.620
How can you think about poker
when my marriage is falling apart?

06:23.709 --> 06:26.540
Well, I figure if it's falling apart.
I better win something from Charlie

06:26.630 --> 06:29.780
before the alimony starts.

06:29.870 --> 06:32.620
Tim, you are an insensitive cretin.

06:32.709 --> 06:36.249
- You're right, Dip?
- Tim!

06:39.669 --> 06:42.050
Robin! Robin!

06:43.310 --> 06:45.870
- Hey, Charlie.
- Are you nuts? Hey, Tim.

06:45.949 --> 06:49.900
I told you you could drive here.
Why did you leave me there?

06:49.989 --> 06:53.140
I didn't like your attitude.

06:53.229 --> 06:56.179
- Charlie, what happened?
- I was driving over here, Jill.

06:56.269 --> 06:59.419
and she started nagging on me.
"Let me drive. Let me drive."

06:59.509 --> 07:03.419
So I pull over. I get out of the car so she
can scoot over, and she took off on me.

07:03.509 --> 07:05.620
Buddy, a little advice.

07:05.709 --> 07:08.780
When you're arguing in
the car, don't get out.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.939
For your information,
I wasn't nagging!

07:12.030 --> 07:16.060
Oh, well, what do you call that screaming
in my ear for 14 blocks, Rob?

07:16.150 --> 07:18.419
- I wasn't screaming in your ear, Charlie.
- Oh. God, it's started.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.820
They'll be at this for hours. You gotta get
your sister out of the house so we can play.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.290
Tim, she's is my sister.
I gotta help her.

07:24.390 --> 07:26.850
Well, take her to that craft fair.
Knit a rug. Blow some glass.

07:26.949 --> 07:29.509
I don't care,
but get her out of the house.

07:29.590 --> 07:33.860
We'll get them out as soon
as they calm down, OK?

07:33.949 --> 07:36.179
Dad, Aunt Robin locked herself
in our bathroom.

07:36.269 --> 07:38.459
Does this mean we're not gonna go
to the arts and crafts fair?

07:38.550 --> 07:40.540
You're going to the arts and crafts fair

07:40.630 --> 07:42.820
as soon as your Aunt Robin
is ready to go.

07:42.909 --> 07:46.219
- Robin, give me those keys!
- No.

07:46.310 --> 07:51.140
- I want them now.
- OK, fine. You want your keys?

07:51.229 --> 07:53.530
There are your keys.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.929
Aunt Robin, are we still going to
the arts and crafts fair?

07:56.030 --> 07:58.019
No, honey.
I'm not going anywhere.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.669
- Yeah! We're not going to the art fair!
- We're not going to the fair!

08:00.749 --> 08:01.890
Oh, great.

08:01.989 --> 08:04.699
I can't believe she threw my keys
into the bushes.

08:04.790 --> 08:06.009
Yeah.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.699
- That must have been 30 feet.
- She's always had a real good arm.

08:13.830 --> 08:16.130
Maybe I ought to just find my keys
and get out of here.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.380
No. The guys' poker game is the last
thing you've got left in your life.

08:19.469 --> 08:22.340
- Don't give up everything to her.
- Well. I've only been married 23 days.

08:22.429 --> 08:25.419
and every day it's been
the same thing. Nag, nag, nag.

08:25.509 --> 08:28.620
"Pick up your socks, pick up your
underwear, pick up your dishes."

08:28.709 --> 08:31.780
Charlie, pick up your keys.

08:33.708 --> 08:37.330
Let me tell you something about women.
Women are a product of their mothers.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.059
And their mothers before that,
and their mothers before that.

08:40.150 --> 08:44.100
This nagging is a genetic thing.
It goes way back, you know?

08:44.188 --> 08:46.900
Maybe to caveman days.
The Serengeti's quiet.

08:46.989 --> 08:49.019
You could hear a pin drop.
But out of a cave hole:

08:49.110 --> 08:53.620
"Hey. Grog, get your hairy butt
out of that bed."

08:53.709 --> 08:57.179
"Did you drag this wildebeest
across this floor?"

08:57.269 --> 09:00.780
"I've been down on my knuckles
and knees all day."

09:00.870 --> 09:03.100
"I washed your loincloth this morning."

09:03.189 --> 09:05.570
"Use some leaves, will ya?"

09:07.909 --> 09:10.290
Why do you think man
invented the wheel?

09:10.390 --> 09:13.100
So he could leave home
now and then.

09:14.790 --> 09:19.100
Crazy, All right, my deal.
Seven card stud. Everybody antes.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.620
Why do they call it "stud"?

09:21.709 --> 09:25.380
Well. I think it's
because you're here, Al.

09:26.310 --> 09:29.580
Charlie, you should have seen this
'40 Chevy project I was working on.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.860
Oh, that pick-up down
at your shop. Beauty.

09:31.949 --> 09:34.939
It's lime green. It's metal flake.
About a mile deep paint job.

09:35.030 --> 09:36.540
This thing is just unbelievable.
It's got a…

09:36.630 --> 09:39.090
- ..454…
- ..454, big Chevy V-8, tunnel rams…

09:39.189 --> 09:41.570
- ..dual quads, polished heads…
- ..350 turbo trans.

09:41.669 --> 09:45.100
ten-inch torque converter.
I mean a sweet piece of metal. Ooh!

09:45.189 --> 09:49.540
This is it, right here. Men talking.
Cigar smoke. Cars.

09:52.870 --> 09:54.900
Don't mind me.
I'm just getting a soda.

09:54.989 --> 09:57.140
You're not down here to get a soda.
You're down here…

09:57.229 --> 10:00.100
Charlie. Charlie, please. Robin, come on.
This is the third soda in 10 minutes.

10:00.189 --> 10:02.650
Jill and I are thirsty.
Do you have any chips?

10:02.749 --> 10:04.219
Yeah. There.

10:04.310 --> 10:07.140
You want some dip?

10:07.229 --> 10:09.259
Chips will be fine.

10:11.189 --> 10:14.810
You know, she's gonna keep interrupting
the game if you don't apologize.

10:14.909 --> 10:16.179
Hey.

10:16.269 --> 10:18.259
Never apologize.

10:19.390 --> 10:23.090
It's admitting you're wrong. I have never
once apologized to any woman.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.620
Freddie, how many times
you been married?

10:24.709 --> 10:26.699
Three.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.380
Why do you suppose that is?

10:29.469 --> 10:32.820
I can't find a woman
who understands me.

10:34.709 --> 10:38.939
Let me jump in here, if I could. Charlie.
Jill and I have been married 12 years.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.860
Good marriage for one reason.
Every day I get up early morning.

10:41.950 --> 10:45.729
Look her right in the eyes and say.
"Jill. I'm sorry."

10:49.269 --> 10:51.380
- For what?
- Everything.

10:51.470 --> 10:55.249
Just being a man, having an Adam's apple,
just breathing. That's it.

10:55.349 --> 10:57.139
Why should I apologize?
She's the one who drove off…

10:57.229 --> 11:00.340
It doesn't matter who's at fault here.
If you don't apologize.

11:00.430 --> 11:03.619
we're not gonna play cards.

11:06.229 --> 11:08.300
- Robin!
- What?

11:08.389 --> 11:11.740
Come on down here.
Charlie wants to say something to ya.

11:11.829 --> 11:16.340
Now, when you apologize to a woman
just look at the floor and nod.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.780
All right, All right.

11:18.869 --> 11:23.700
You know, the apology might be more
effective if you really meant it.

11:26.829 --> 11:30.059
Guess which one of us
at this table's not married?

11:30.150 --> 11:32.260
Boom.

11:43.749 --> 11:46.340
You wanted to say something?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.419
I'm sorry.

11:53.110 --> 11:56.180
- Good apology.
- Very good.

11:57.110 --> 12:01.300
- Honey, I shouldn't have driven off.
- Oh, that's OK.

12:01.389 --> 12:04.419
So this means from now on,
when I want to drive the car I can?

12:04.510 --> 12:07.180
Hey. I said I was sorry, not stupid.

12:10.470 --> 12:12.459
Oh, no!

12:17.349 --> 12:20.780
- Quarter to you.
- Already in.

12:20.869 --> 12:23.619
- All right.
- I fold.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.939
Really? You folded every
hand tonight, Al.

12:27.030 --> 12:29.900
I prefer to be cautious.

12:30.910 --> 12:34.419
There's a reason they
call it gambling, Al.

12:35.430 --> 12:39.050
- I'll call.
- OK. Two pair, queens and eights.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.939
I haven't had a decent hand all night.

12:42.030 --> 12:45.019
Well. I haven't seen Robin for a while.

12:45.110 --> 12:49.300
- Maybe she's OK now.
- Mm-hm. No. She's not OK.

12:49.389 --> 12:52.930
I know I'm a bit of a slob, but she used to
think it was cute before we were married.

12:53.030 --> 12:55.380
Now I can't get her off my back.

12:55.470 --> 12:59.249
You want her off your back?
Do something unexpected.

12:59.349 --> 13:02.970
Like the laundry, but make sure
she knows you're doing it.

13:03.070 --> 13:07.930
"Honey, where's the fabric softener? I'm
doing the laundry." And then when you…

13:08.030 --> 13:11.780
Start mumbling like. "I can't seem to get
the whites as clean as you get them, hon."

13:11.869 --> 13:14.820
They love that stuff.

13:14.910 --> 13:19.900
You know, Tim, the trouble with your
whites may be you're not presoaking.

13:25.309 --> 13:28.340
- Thank you, Al.
- Let's ante up.

13:31.869 --> 13:35.099
You know, I've been married 12 years.

13:35.189 --> 13:39.019
And the reason I have a good marriage
is because of one word. Compromise.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.619
And who does all the compromise
in a relationship? Men.

13:41.709 --> 13:44.900
It's always 60-40.
Now let's play some cards.

13:45.550 --> 13:48.220
- Three kings. Is that good?
- I fold.

13:48.309 --> 13:50.939
Me too.

13:54.470 --> 13:59.590
See. I like everything to be 50-50. I like
a he to be a he and a she to be a she.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.900
Robbie, can I give you just
a little piece of advice?

14:04.990 --> 14:09.059
- No.
- Well, you're gonna hear it anyway.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.979
Marriage is about one thing -
compromise.

14:11.070 --> 14:12.939
- And guess who gets to do most of that?
- We do.

14:13.030 --> 14:15.019
It's 70-30.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.900
Unless you count childbirth,
and then it's 97-3.

14:18.990 --> 14:19.939
Yeah. I know.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.260
Now, listen, you need to
learn to let some things go.

14:22.349 --> 14:25.019
because you know you make
everything such a big deal.

14:25.110 --> 14:28.220
Just eliminate the things
that drive you the craziest.

14:28.309 --> 14:30.740
Well, that would be Charlie.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.340
He is such a slob, Jill.

14:33.430 --> 14:37.740
He leaves his clothes on the floor,
his wet towels on the bed.

14:37.829 --> 14:41.220
- I wish he was more like Tim.
- Hah!

14:41.309 --> 14:43.019
At least Tim helps you out
around the house.

14:43.110 --> 14:46.220
Well, of course he does.
I trained him.

14:46.309 --> 14:50.860
Without me he'd still be in the backyard
eating out of a trough.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.550
How did you train him?

14:55.630 --> 15:00.180
- Well, first I got rid of the trough.
- Come on. What did you do?

15:00.269 --> 15:05.099
I just used positive reinforcement.
You remember that puppy

15:05.189 --> 15:08.180
that Dad brought home that we had
so much trouble house-breaking?

15:08.269 --> 15:11.180
- Puddles?
- Yeah.

15:12.309 --> 15:14.689
I did the same stuff with Tim
that we did with Puddles.

15:14.789 --> 15:19.300
This is good. You taught him
to roll over and play dead?

15:19.389 --> 15:22.539
No, Tim already
knew how to do that.

15:24.269 --> 15:26.499
All right. A quarter to you. I'm in.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.860
- I'm in.
- Me too.

15:28.950 --> 15:32.019
Al folds.

15:32.110 --> 15:34.740
- I'm in.
- Well, you don't say.

15:34.829 --> 15:38.700
Welcome to the game, Al.
It's about damn time.

15:38.789 --> 15:41.979
How much is the most you can raise?

15:43.470 --> 15:47.139
Well, there's a three-dollar limit.
Daddy Warbucks.

15:48.150 --> 15:51.260
OK. I raise that.

15:51.349 --> 15:53.579
Oh, he must have something good.
I'm out.

15:53.669 --> 15:58.459
- I'm out. He better have something good.
- I'm sticking. What do you have, Al?

15:58.550 --> 16:02.579
A flush. All black cards.
Read 'em and cry.

16:08.229 --> 16:11.180
I hate to burst your bubble, Al,

16:11.269 --> 16:13.700
but a flush is all the same suit.

16:13.789 --> 16:17.220
Clubs, diamonds…
All the same something.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.660
Oh.

16:18.749 --> 16:20.740
Then I fold.

16:23.269 --> 16:25.860
Ante up. Let's play.

16:26.510 --> 16:32.059
Jill and I have been talking and
I realize your car means a lot to you

16:33.470 --> 16:36.459
and I think we should discuss it.

16:36.550 --> 16:39.700
- In a minute, Rob.
- No, we need to talk now.

16:39.789 --> 16:43.059
Unbelievable. You wait till
I get three aces…

16:43.150 --> 16:43.979
- I fold.
- I fold.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.499
- I fold.
- Oh, hold on.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.260
Thanks a lot, Rob.
You blew the whole hand.

16:48.349 --> 16:50.910
Oh, well. I guess I'm the only one
worried about this relationship.

16:50.990 --> 16:54.979
Ah, now, come on. I'm not worried
about the relationship.

16:55.070 --> 16:57.579
I thought the best thing
about being married was knowing

16:57.669 --> 16:59.900
we're always gonna be there
to work it out.

16:59.990 --> 17:02.660
- You mean that?
- Yes.

17:03.349 --> 17:07.098
- You're not mad about the three aces?
- No!

17:07.189 --> 17:09.900
But I'm crazy about the four Tops.

17:11.550 --> 17:15.539
- I missed you, cupcake.
- I missed you, too, pookie.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.180
All right, now that we got that over with,
can we play cards now. Chuck?

17:20.269 --> 17:21.819
- Do you want to go home?
- Let's go.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.419
- Yes!
- Charlie, where you going?

17:23.510 --> 17:24.979
- We're playing cards here.
- Bye. Robbie.

17:25.069 --> 17:26.700
- See you next month, Tim.
- Bye. Charlie.

17:26.789 --> 17:29.300
Charlie, we can't play with three guys.
Charlie!

17:29.389 --> 17:31.619
- Maybe Jill would like to join us.
- No, she wouldn't.

17:31.709 --> 17:34.700
- Oh, thanks, Al. I love poker.
- Hey, you can't sit down at this table

17:34.789 --> 17:37.619
unless you can bench press
150 pounds.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.979
Al, sit down.

17:43.869 --> 17:46.169
Come on, Tim, I can play poker.
What are you doing here?

17:46.269 --> 17:49.380
You want Chicago, high-low,
anaconda, what?

17:49.470 --> 17:51.459
- What's anaconda?
- It's a snake, Al.

17:51.550 --> 17:54.300
Now, shut up for a minute.
You can't play at this table

17:54.389 --> 17:57.660
unless you know the compression
ratio of a 327 Chevy engine.

17:57.749 --> 18:00.180
Boy, you are really tough
on your wife.

18:00.269 --> 18:05.389
Talk about it, Mr Three-Alimony-Payment
Man. I'm very good to my wife.

18:05.470 --> 18:08.099
- Then you should let her play.
- Yeah. That's right.

18:08.189 --> 18:10.099
OK, great. OK, great.
Let's just lift up the felt,

18:10.189 --> 18:11.900
put down some doilies,
get the sewing machine out.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.780
This is supposed to be
men playing poker tonight.

18:14.869 --> 18:18.139
You can't play poker
with three people.

18:18.229 --> 18:21.660
- How about canasta?
- Well, now you're talking.

18:29.950 --> 18:32.220
Wilson, can I ask you a question?

18:32.309 --> 18:34.900
I believe you just did, Tim.

18:37.990 --> 18:41.340
Heard a lot of noise
coming from your house tonight.

18:41.430 --> 18:47.059
Yeah, that's Jill's sister and her husband.
Newlyweds. They're always fighting.

18:47.150 --> 18:50.849
Well. I seem to remember a couple of
newlyweds that moved in next door to me

18:50.950 --> 18:53.059
that I thought would
never stop fighting.

18:53.150 --> 18:56.019
Jill and I. Boy, is that odd.

18:56.110 --> 19:00.139
We've been married 12 years
and I still get so mad at her.

19:00.229 --> 19:03.900
- Angry. Just cos she's a woman.
- So, what is your question?

19:03.990 --> 19:07.059
How do women and men
even stay together?

19:08.189 --> 19:11.220
It has to do with barbed wire, Tim.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.900
Huh?

19:16.950 --> 19:20.099
As a boy I used to spend summers
at my Uncle Leonard's farm

19:20.189 --> 19:23.809
and at the edge of his property
he had a huge oak tree.

19:23.910 --> 19:27.860
Running through the middle of that tree
was an old barbed-wire fence.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.380
- It went right through the tree?
- Right through the middle of the tree.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.939
When a tree is planted close to
a fence it has nowhere to grow.

19:34.030 --> 19:37.570
As it expands and grows bigger
it extends over the fence

19:37.669 --> 19:41.099
and slowly envelops the wire.

19:41.189 --> 19:44.619
The two separate entities gradually
become one.

19:46.309 --> 19:48.979
Am I the tree or the barbed wire?

19:49.070 --> 19:52.019
Well. I don't think you're the tree, Tim.

19:53.189 --> 19:56.180
Ah, the point is, the two were joined
without destroying the tree

19:56.269 --> 19:59.300
or losing the integrity of the fence.

19:59.389 --> 20:04.019
It's almost as if they
belong together.

20:05.269 --> 20:08.099
Like Jill and me.

20:08.189 --> 20:10.459
Oh…

20:11.869 --> 20:15.019
Well. I don't know, Tim, but it looks
like everything in the universe

20:15.110 --> 20:17.459
is in harmony tonight.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.260
Not quite yet, Wilson.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.939
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:27.189 --> 20:30.459
I'm sorry your poker night
turned out to be a bust.

20:30.550 --> 20:36.700
Well, it certainly wasn't your fault,
and I do apologize for being so rough.

20:36.789 --> 20:42.889
It's just that sometimes I don't know
where my fence ends and your tree begins.

20:42.990 --> 20:44.740
Huh?

20:44.829 --> 20:48.059
I just wanted one night
of playing poker with the guys.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.660
- With the guys?
- That was it.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.539
Well. I think that
I can give that to you.

20:55.349 --> 20:58.180
Just call me Murray.

21:00.709 --> 21:05.019
So, how about those Pistons?
Think they'll win the series?

21:05.110 --> 21:07.619
You're pathetic.

21:07.709 --> 21:10.499
- What's the game?
- Depends what we're playing.

21:10.590 --> 21:14.059
- High card?
- What are the stakes?

21:14.150 --> 21:16.340
Winner has to kiss the loser.

21:18.150 --> 21:19.979
Murray!

21:24.189 --> 21:26.539
I had no idea.

21:26.630 --> 21:29.010
- I'm in.
- All right.

21:29.829 --> 21:31.780
Oh…

21:32.709 --> 21:35.269
Come here. Murray.

21:35.349 --> 21:37.979
Give me that cigar.

21:42.829 --> 21:45.499
Before we go. let's take one
last look at this fender.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.660
Boy, that hard work paid off, Al.

21:47.749 --> 21:50.660
We applied 120 coats of lacquer.
Mm-mm-mm.

21:50.749 --> 21:55.740
"We", Tim? Well, you did the first coat
of lacquer. I did the next 119.

21:56.950 --> 22:00.650
Well, like I said, between us
we applied 120 coats.

22:01.669 --> 22:05.340
You know, this fender
reminds me of a good marriage.

22:05.430 --> 22:09.939
Stick with me on this one, All you see on
the outside is a shiny lacquer finish.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.860
You don't know about
the hard work that went into it.

22:11.950 --> 22:13.979
Like a good marriage. You see a good
marriage on the outside

22:14.100 --> 22:16.560
but you don't know about
the hard work that went into it.

22:16.559 --> 22:18.859
The enamel finish
and the marriage

22:18.960 --> 22:22.349
both need hard work and dedication
to make them come out right.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.230
The only difference is…

22:25.319 --> 22:27.509
you want your mother-in-law
to steer clear of your marriage.

22:27.599 --> 22:30.390
but right in front of your fender.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.190
Just kidding, Nana.

22:34.279 --> 22:38.109
Well, that's it for me, Tim "The Tool Man"
Taylor with my buddy, Al, saying so long.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.150
See you next time.

22:50.599 --> 22:52.269
Why are men so loud?

22:52.359 --> 22:55.670
I think the testosterone
affects their hearing.

22:58.559 --> 23:01.789
You know. I just attached my TV
to my stereo. 80 watts a channel.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.950
And I still can't listen to it. The wife's
always going. "Turn it down. Turn it down."

23:06.039 --> 23:08.230
I got the remote control.
"I wish I could turn you down that easy."

23:08.319 --> 23:10.509
What is it with women
and loud music?

23:10.599 --> 23:13.190
I think it's the estrogen.
