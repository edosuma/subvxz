<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>was recorded</i>

00:05.706 --> 00:07.339
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:08.607
Hey.
Hmm?

00:08.609 --> 00:11.043
Who keeps putting empty boxes
back in the pantry?

00:11.045 --> 00:12.177
Her.
Her.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.380
There's more out there, dad.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.548
[ sighs ]

00:16.550 --> 00:18.550
Boy, how long
has this been there?

00:18.552 --> 00:22.221
You know, I think bruce jenner
looks younger <i>now.</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:23.889
Hi, guys.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.724
Uh, so,
I am gonna need someone

00:25.726 --> 00:27.793
To watch Boyd
this week after school.

00:27.795 --> 00:28.827
Here's
a radical thought --

00:28.829 --> 00:30.029
What about
either of his parents?

00:30.031 --> 00:32.798
No. Listen, Ryan's driving
a long haul to reno,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.167
And I am swamped
at the new restaurant.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.037
[ groans ]
blue-collar problems. Pass.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.204
Dad?

00:39.206 --> 00:40.973
Why do I have to do
everything around here?

00:40.975 --> 00:41.874
Thank you!

00:41.876 --> 00:42.975
Eve, take care of Boyd.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.543
What?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.712
Why do I always get
brat duty?

00:46.714 --> 00:49.014
Because that's what families do.
They help each other.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.316
I just helped Kris by making you
take care of her kid.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.819
All right, fine.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.888
$10 an hour.
What? No, I --

00:55.890 --> 00:58.657
You don't help people
expecting something in return.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.093
But since I did help you, grab
a lobster from work tonight.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.395
You got it. Thanks, dad.
You are the best.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.897
You're thanking <i>him?</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:06.398
This place is the worst.
I know.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.233
Central air,
all the food you can eat --

01:08.235 --> 01:10.436
It's like working
in a south african diamond mine.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.570
La-la-la-la-la.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.239
You're not gonna ruin diamonds
for me.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.041
Hey, everybody.
Oh, hey, Kyle.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.676
Here, try this gouda.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.378
Okay.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.747
Yum! That's a "gouda" piece
of cheese.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.282
[ both laugh ]

01:23.284 --> 01:25.751
Kyle is helping me with
my nutrition class experiment.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.120
For one whole week,
he's eating nothing but cheese.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.555
Yeah.
I love cheese.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.223
The only piece of equipment
you're gonna need

01:31.225 --> 01:34.560
Is a ruler to measure
the width of my smile.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.728
Hey, Mandy, Kyle.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.565
Good day to you,
Vanessa gladys Baxter.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.733
My mother
always uses my full name

01:41.735 --> 01:44.103
When she feels
we're not on good terms.

01:44.105 --> 01:47.072
I don't know what's worse --
that you're still mad at me

01:47.074 --> 01:49.308
Or you think
my middle name is gladys.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.077
Great. You can add that
to my list of failings.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.313
I'm not good
at guessing middle names.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.247
Bye.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.381
[ groans ]

01:56.383 --> 01:58.050
[ groans mockingly ]
what?

01:58.052 --> 01:59.751
He's the nicest kid
in the world.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.220
He hates you.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.789
It's like pissing off
a care bear, honey.
[ scoffs ]

02:03.791 --> 02:06.492
All I did was hint
to Mandy

02:06.494 --> 02:09.661
That she should...
Explore her options...

02:09.663 --> 02:11.663
Yeah, mm-hmm.
...With other boys.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.398
Yep.
Okay,
now I'm hearing it.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.402
They say true evil can be sensed
by dogs and children.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.938
And he's a combination
of both.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.407
I will talk to him
and straighten this out.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.775
No, no. Please, don't.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.344
I know you mean well, but
when you try to fix things...

02:25.346 --> 02:26.645
You wreck them.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.948
You're like, um...
Like a playful little elephant.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.483
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.019
I never forget who's with me,
who's against me,

02:34.021 --> 02:37.189
And who just called me
an elephant.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.323
That --

02:39.359 --> 02:42.194
Okay, perfect!

02:42.196 --> 02:45.264
-- Captions by vitac --

02:48.468 --> 02:50.302
I'm telling you --
I measured.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.603
It's actually farther

02:51.605 --> 02:53.472
For them to take the empty
cereal box to the pantry

02:53.474 --> 02:55.107
Than to take it
all the way to the trash.

02:55.109 --> 02:58.710
When my kids did that,
I'd cut eyeholes in the box

02:58.712 --> 03:01.346
And make them wear it
to school.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.716
And one time, the holes lined up
with tony the tiger's eyes.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.984
It was hysterical.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.219
[ chuckles ]

03:07.221 --> 03:10.522
You don't see much
of your kids, do you?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.291
Wait a second, Kyle.
Kyle.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.892
I ran over
another squirrel.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.228
What's left of it
is stuck in the tire tread,

03:16.230 --> 03:17.563
And make that go away,
please.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.999
That's the third squirrel
this month.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.968
I'm beginning to think
he's got a dark side.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.002
Yeah.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.504
Feel lucky
he didn't make you go down

03:25.506 --> 03:27.506
And do that
with a cereal box on your head.
Yeah.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.909
Oh, uh, they're asking for you
down in the loading dock.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.411
It's javier's birthday.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.745
Big javier
or skinny javier?

03:33.747 --> 03:34.846
Big javier.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.315
Oh! That means
there's flan.

03:37.817 --> 03:41.153
Kyle, try not to puncture
the tire tread

03:41.155 --> 03:43.388
When you're digging
that little guy out, all right?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.757
And pick me up
a new letter opener.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.393
Ed: Vanessa.
Hey, Ed.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.596
Well, look at that.
What are you doing here?
[ chuckles ]

03:50.598 --> 03:54.366
Is everything all right?
Uh, did Eve fall down a well?

03:54.368 --> 03:56.568
No.
Why would you go there?

03:56.570 --> 03:57.869
Why would you come here?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.938
Well, I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.340
What <i>are</i> you doing here?

04:01.342 --> 04:04.109
Well, I just came by
to talk to Kyle.
Mm-hmm.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.745
He's been a little angry
with me lately.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.113
Kyle?
Yeah, yeah.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.581
He's the nicest kid
the world.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.517
I know.
He's a peach.
Yeah.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.553
He'd give you
the shirt of his back.
Ah.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.587
I had to make a rule.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.222
It was like chippendale's
in here.

04:17.224 --> 04:21.260
I am perfectly aware
of how nice Kyle is.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.862
Well, perhaps your tone
is part of the problem.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.365
Kyle is out
on important business,

04:26.367 --> 04:27.866
And Mike is eating flan.
Ah.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.568
So, I'll tell them both
you stopped by, all right?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.069
Uh-huh.
Oh, you know what, Ed?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.605
Um, uh, you don't need to
let Mike know I was here.
Mm-hmm.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.141
We -- we have a policy about not
bothering each other at work.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.976
Ah. Solid policy.
Yeah.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.746
Apparently not written
in stone.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.747
Kyle.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.148
Hi.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.916
Uh -- oh, wait, wait, wait.
Kyle, wait.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.986
I-I just came by
to say I'm sorry

04:47.988 --> 04:50.622
For trying to undermine
your relationship with Mandy.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.557
I can understand
why you've been mad.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.727
"mad" is
a pretty fancy word.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.597
Uh, no, not really.

04:58.599 --> 05:02.167
I've actually been more --
more upset.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.502
Oh.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.271
Mostly because part of me thinks
that maybe you're right.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.140
Maybe I'm not good enough
for Mandy.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.075
Oh, no.
You know, in my defense,

05:10.077 --> 05:12.811
Uh, you were never supposed to
know I thought that.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.146
No, I-I get it.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.348
I mean,
how can any man compare

05:16.350 --> 05:19.418
With the impossibly high
standard set by mr. B.?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.687
Men want to be him,
and women want to be with him.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.257
Animals want to be killed
by him.
All right.

05:26.859 --> 05:30.028
You know, Mike -- Mike wasn't
always such a big success.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.831
I mean, he --
he just believed in himself --

05:32.833 --> 05:33.932
Really believed.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.502
Like abnormal,
delusional belief.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.271
I believe in myself.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.707
I believe
I'm not that impressive.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.941
Ohh.
Honey, you know what?

05:42.943 --> 05:44.543
Maybe that's
what's holding you back.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.044
I mean,
I underestimated you

05:46.046 --> 05:47.879
Because you
underestimate yourself.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.048
Vanessa.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.249
Still here, huh?

05:52.385 --> 05:55.053
Uh, why
are you still here?

05:55.055 --> 05:58.123
I was just telling Kyle
what a special young man he is.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.191
Oh.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.393
Mr. Alzate already knows.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.228
That's why he gave me
a special job --

06:03.230 --> 06:05.263
Picking something
out of his tire tread.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.000
Something
with very kind eyes.

06:09.002 --> 06:13.071
What -- Kyle, that, um,
sounds kind of degrading.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.240
I mean, is that --
is that really your job?

06:15.242 --> 06:17.876
Well, I do a little bit
of everything around here.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.144
I'm called a "floater."

06:19.146 --> 06:22.214
Speaking of which, would you
float out to the Taco truck

06:22.216 --> 06:23.882
And get me
a number three?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.417
But -- but say
"numero tres"

06:25.419 --> 06:27.252
So they use the new meat,
all right?

06:27.254 --> 06:30.555
Y-yes, sir.
Okay, Kyle, wait, stop.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.591
Stop. Kyle. Wait.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.895
If you could have any job
at outdoor man,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.296
What would it be?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.999
No, no,
don't look at him!

06:41.001 --> 06:42.734
Look at me.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.238
Well, I-I really like it
when I work on the sales floor.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.907
It would be nice
to be a full-time salesman.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.509
Oh, well,
how about selling boats?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.344
I mean, that --
that's an important job.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.378
Yeah?
I like boats.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.746
Yeah, yeah! Good!
Then it's settled.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.781
Yeah!
Okay!

06:55.783 --> 06:57.015
[ both laugh ]

06:57.017 --> 06:59.684
What's happening?

06:59.686 --> 07:01.386
Kyle's gonna be
a boat salesman.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.055
This is gonna be great for him
to work on his confidence.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.290
[ chuckles ]

07:05.292 --> 07:07.893
Well, that's who we need
selling our most expensive item.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.060
[ chuckles ]

07:09.062 --> 07:11.129
Yes, a beginner
working on his confidence.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.031
Oh, Ed, come on.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.533
Let's do this.
Come on.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.967
I --
yeah.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.068
[ chuckles nervously ]

07:17.070 --> 07:18.303
All right, of course.
Yeah.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.604
Congratulations, Kyle.
Congratulations.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.740
[ chuckles ]
thank you, mr. Alzate, mrs. B.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.375
I'm gonna be
a great salesman.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.410
But unlike every salesman
that came to our house,

07:25.412 --> 07:27.279
I am <i>not</i> gonna sleep
with my grandmother.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.651
Hey, hey.
Oh, hi.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.785
[ chuckles ] uh...
Hi.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.220
Wh-- uh, uh, are we supposed
to have lunch today?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.721
'cause I don't --
I wasn't gonna eat this flan.
No, I --

07:36.723 --> 07:38.256
I got this for somebody else.
There you go.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.926
Uh, no, I just actually came by
to work things out with Kyle.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.394
Honey? Honey? I did --

07:42.396 --> 07:44.229
And something really wonderful
happened.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.964
Yes, wonderful things
always happen

07:45.966 --> 07:47.466
When wives visit
unannounced.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.901
Can I talk to you
in the office?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.337
It's a completely
unrelated matter, so...

07:52.339 --> 07:53.505
Go ahead.
No, I got to get back to work.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.606
What was -- okay.
Okay, bye. Love you.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.807
Okay, bye.
Love you, too.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.776
Okay. Okay.
That's --

07:57.778 --> 07:59.578
Don't even think about it!

08:02.849 --> 08:04.816
What's up?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.818
Your wife's a menace.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.420
S-somehow she talked me

08:08.422 --> 08:11.456
Into giving Kyle a promotion
to boat salesman.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.624
Boat salesman?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.926
How did you let my wife
talk you into doing that?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.461
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.963
There was a flurry
of hair and teeth.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.097
I don't know.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.002
You know I have trouble saying
no to attractive women.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.439
I mean, that's how
I ended up with four wives.

08:27.441 --> 08:31.376
And more recently,
a-a pair of skinny jeans.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.477
That's not a good idea.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.879
A guy your age
should be able to sit down.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.548
Just tell Kyle
you changed your mind.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.216
Tell him
he can't be a salesman.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.351
I can't do that.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.052
You should have seen
the kid's face light up.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.221
Oh, it would be cruel
to take that away from him!

08:43.223 --> 08:44.456
[ chuckling ] no.
You do it.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.558
Me?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.627
Yeah, yes.
You married Vanessa.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.662
Listen,
it's always a bad idea

08:50.664 --> 08:53.565
When wives get involved in --
in your business.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.869
Yeah, that's how we end up with
yoko ono and hillary clinton.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.905
Hey, please,
please explain to Vanessa

08:59.907 --> 09:01.706
Not to interfere
at the store.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.208
She's never done this
before, Ed.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.677
Yeah, I know, but once they get
a taste, they're hooked.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.078
I'm telling you.
[ sighs ]

09:07.080 --> 09:10.582
My second wife, she wanted to
add a section to our store

09:10.584 --> 09:13.184
To sell scented candles
and potpourri.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.853
It would have been
a perfect place

09:14.855 --> 09:16.555
For you to wear
your skinny jeans.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.556
[ chuckles ]

09:27.033 --> 09:28.500
[ sighs ]

09:34.740 --> 09:35.774
What?!

09:35.776 --> 09:36.942
[ chuckles ]

09:36.944 --> 09:39.010
I spilled in the kitchen.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.245
Well, clean it up.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.514
I tried, but now the hose
won't turn off.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.249
You brought the hose
in the house?!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.318
What are you
talking about?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.921
[ chuckles ]

09:49.923 --> 09:52.390
Made you look!
[ laughs ]
funny.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.558
Very funny.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.226
You know, I've got
a really big test tomorrow,

09:55.228 --> 09:57.095
And I don't have time to go
running all over the house

09:57.097 --> 09:58.863
Trying to make your death
look like an accident.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.198
[ sighs ]

10:00.200 --> 10:01.266
Want to play a game?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.434
No.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.135
Want to play a game?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.303
No!

10:06.539 --> 10:08.373
Want to play a game?
Okay, stop!

10:08.375 --> 10:09.507
[ sighs ]

10:10.810 --> 10:14.145
Hey, Boyd. You know
what would be a really fun game?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.046
What?

10:15.048 --> 10:17.816
It's called
"cave explorer."

10:17.818 --> 10:19.784
Okay.
Come with me.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.654
All right.
So, I give you this flashlight,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.222
Turn off all the lights
in the basement,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.458
And, uh, send you
down there.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.826
To look for what?

10:27.828 --> 10:31.630
Don't worry.
It'll find you.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.999
Cool.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.072
Hey, there.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.107
Hey, honey.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.776
So, how were things
at work today?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.244
Well, you should know.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.313
Ed said you're making a lot
of big decisions around there.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.748
I'm so glad
I stood up for Kyle.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.583
You know, I think,
with a little more support,

10:51.585 --> 10:54.152
He could really make something
of himself.
Honey, honey, honey.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.087
Look, when you come to work
like that,

10:56.089 --> 10:57.689
You upset
a delicate ecosystem.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.624
Could you get to the point
without the metaphor?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.660
It's like the mississippi river,
all right?
Oh, no. No.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.030
An asian carp got introduced
into the mississippi river.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.765
It's an invasive species
that's called the bighead,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.366
And it pushed out
other fish,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.869
It ate the vegetation,
caused erosion, flooding.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.103
Towns were devastated.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.505
That's how it felt
at work today.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.342
So, I'm a carp?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.778
I-I thought I was
a playful elephant.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.946
[ chuckles ]
you didn't like that.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.281
So now you're
a well-meaning bighead

11:23.283 --> 11:24.616
Destroying
other species.

11:24.618 --> 11:28.620
I don't see how promoting Kyle
devastates anything.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.955
It devastates our sales force.
He's not a salesman.

11:30.957 --> 11:31.990
Oh, just give him
a chance.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.358
I'm just trying
to build his confidence.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.126
I appreciate ambition,
I really do,

11:35.128 --> 11:37.395
But you're pushing this kid
past his abilities.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.498
You're a good salesman.
Give him some pointers.
I can't -- no, no.
It's not that simple.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.400
Sales involves an edge.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.902
He's too sweet a kid.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.237
He's only hated
one person in his life,

11:46.239 --> 11:48.907
And that person
has made him a boat salesman.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.410
You're wrong about Kyle,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.246
And you are wrong
about me being a bighead.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.582
Well-meaning bighead.
Playful elephant.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.617
Try to focus
on the adjectives.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.420
Hey.
Oh, hey, mom.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.756
Thanks for ruining
my boyfriend.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.358
Whoa! See?
Total devastation.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.560
I did not ruin Kyle.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.395
I'm just trying
to help him better himself.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.030
Well, all he wants to
talk about now

12:12.032 --> 12:13.598
Is the stupid boat job
you got him.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.735
Inboard, outboard, fiberglass,
aluminum -- oh, my god.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.104
Look at all the stuff
that I know now.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.805
Good going, bighead.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.079
She's a beauty,
isn't she?

12:28.081 --> 12:31.683
And it's "a boat" time
for you to buy one.

12:31.685 --> 12:32.851
Oh, man, I love it,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.853
And it's right
in my price range.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.088
Well, not really
once you factor in taxes,

12:37.090 --> 12:38.923
Maintenance,
a trailer, dock fees.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.258
And when you drop it
in the water,

12:40.260 --> 12:41.359
It loses half its value.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.595
You don't make it sound
very appealing.

12:43.597 --> 12:47.098
Oh, no. They say the two best
days in a boat owner's life...
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.433
Hold on.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.835
...Is the day he buys one
and the day he sells it.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.473
So you're guaranteed
at least two great days.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.609
Yeah, I should probably
talk it over with my wife.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.943
Hey, hold on a second.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.445
You might want to talk to dave,
our sales manager,

13:00.447 --> 13:01.746
About the financing
options.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.081
Very attractive
on this model.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.716
Yeah, okay.
[ chuckling ] okay.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.217
Hey, you forgot
to tell him

13:06.219 --> 13:08.486
That boats flip, catch fire,
and people drown.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.322
Dave will fill him in.
He knows his stuff.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.258
Kyle, when you get
to big-ticket items,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.260
You got to learn
how to close the sale.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.162
What if they don't need
a boat?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.630
Listen, you're not
the government.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.665
It's not your job
to tell people what they need.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.269
Let's focus
on the positive,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.137
And let's role-play
a little bit.
Okay.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.305
Okay?
[ clears throat ]

13:27.307 --> 13:28.406
Hey, you work here?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.375
Yeah, I'm Kyle.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.945
I'm interested
in this boat here.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.680
Boy, what a beauty, huh?
Oh. Oh, yeah.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.515
Uh, this beauty is
our open-bow model.
Wow.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.517
So, when it flips,
you won't get trapped under it.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.787
And it's red.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.997
Cave explorer?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.265
Oh, hey.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.267
So, you finally spent some time
with your kid.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.603
You locked Boyd
in the basement.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.138
He was fine.
It's a bomb shelter.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.207
If we'd all been nuked,
you'd be thanking me.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.109
Yeah, well, we weren't nuked,
so I guess the joke's on you.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.045
You are never watching
my son again.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.314
[ chuckling ]
oh, that'll show me.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.183
I can't believe you!
You are so completely selfish.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.285
Oh, because I don't want to
drop everything

14:14.287 --> 14:15.954
To watch <i>your</i> kid,
<i>I'm</i> selfish?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.456
What about the millions of times
I gave up everything

14:18.458 --> 14:20.558
To watch you
when you were Boyd's age, huh?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.561
That was different.
I was an unbridled delight.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.463
You were an unbridled brat,
okay?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.999
[ chuckles ] but we --
we still had fun together.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.301
Remember? We --
we used to play candy land

14:30.303 --> 14:32.537
And watch
inappropriate movies.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.806
You -- you would dress up
in dad's camo gear and --

14:34.808 --> 14:37.041
Oh, yeah, and I'd do that
killer impression of him.
Mm-hmm.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.244
[ as Mike ]
oh, john kerry's a communist.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.312
These colors don't run!

14:41.314 --> 14:42.480
Boyd is your nephew.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.083
Why can't you just try
and have more fun with him?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.385
You're just afraid
that, uh,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.587
He's gonna beat you
at candy land, huh?

14:49.589 --> 14:50.922
No way.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.924
I can drop that queen frostine
card out of my sleeve

14:52.926 --> 14:54.058
Anytime I need it.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.595
Okay, no.
You're right.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.765
If dad's gonna make me
watch Boyd all the time,

15:00.767 --> 15:03.101
I should make the best
of it.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.337
Hey. You know
what might be fun for us?

15:06.339 --> 15:07.372
What?

15:07.374 --> 15:09.908
A little candy land rematch.
Right now.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.009
You and me.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.444
You serious?
Yeah.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.880
Now I'm sorry
I told you I cheat.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.716
Yeah,
just go get the game.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.552
Prepare to be spanked
by lord licorice.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.589
First, we'll play a little game
of cave explorer.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.357
What?! What?! Hey! No!

15:26.359 --> 15:27.725
[ pounding ]

15:27.727 --> 15:29.560
Hey!

15:29.562 --> 15:31.129
[ sighs ]

15:31.131 --> 15:34.499
All right.
I guess I had that one coming.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.538
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.607
Boats --
sleek, powerful, beautiful.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.775
I like boats.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.277
Why? Because they know
their purpose.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.614
They float --
at least, ours do.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.316
The ancient greeks had a term

15:51.318 --> 15:53.918
For living up
to one's potential -- telos.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.654
The telos of an acorn
is an oak tree,

15:56.656 --> 15:58.556
But don't tell the oak tree

15:58.558 --> 16:01.793
Its telos is
the dining-room table you buy

16:01.795 --> 16:03.561
At paul's house of oak.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.829
The challenge of our lives

16:04.831 --> 16:06.831
Is figuring out
what we were born to do

16:06.833 --> 16:08.833
And doing it
to the best of our abilities.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.768
The real greek tragedy

16:10.770 --> 16:14.639
Is spending your life
chasing the wrong telos.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.107
Trust me.

16:16.109 --> 16:20.945
When I was young,
I chased a lot of telos.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.482
I had a buddy who was convinced
he should be in show business,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.651
Spent 20 years
chasing that dream,

16:26.653 --> 16:28.786
Working hard at being an actor.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.456
Finally,
he had to make some dough.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.957
And you know what he discovered?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.193
He liked landscaping,
and he was great at it.

16:35.195 --> 16:39.163
Now he's living his telos
in taos.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498
And he's never been happier.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.300
If you need someone
to cut your grass

16:42.302 --> 16:44.469
Who's also been
in one radioshack commercial,

16:44.471 --> 16:46.004
I know a guy.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.772
So, what's your telos?

16:47.774 --> 16:51.109
And can you achieve it
by buying this boat?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.845
I'd say yes.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.685
Sorry, Mike.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.953
Where you been?

17:01.955 --> 17:03.521
We were supposed to have
the inventory meeting

17:03.523 --> 17:05.123
20 minutes ago.
Yeah.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.993
I came this close to asking
somebody about their family.

17:08.995 --> 17:12.363
Kyle used to pick up
my dry cleaning for me.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.499
Apparently,
if they don't know your face,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.134
You need
some kind of ticket.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.136
That's a sundress, Ed.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.872
I don't think you have
the shoulders or the legs

17:20.874 --> 17:22.807
To pull that off.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.376
I-I grabbed whatever I could
and ran.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.478
I haven't been chased that hard
by vietnamese people

17:27.480 --> 17:29.647
Since the war.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.083
You know, they say
war changes a man,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.752
And here you are stealing
women's clothes.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.587
Look at this.
No Kyle, no coffee.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.190
You know, I-I asked you
to fix this Kyle situation.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.591
I'm working on it.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.727
You know,
I really miss that kid.
Yeah.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.030
Yeah. Everybody thinks it's
the big shots who run things.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.366
No, it's the unsung doofuses
like Kyle

17:48.368 --> 17:49.767
Who keep things ticking.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.036
Hey, Kyle, we were just
talking about you, right, Ed?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.171
Tell him.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.173
Yes, yes.
Son, I, uh --

17:55.175 --> 17:56.908
I just want you to know
that, uh,

17:56.910 --> 17:59.610
I-I'd be lying if I didn't say
I miss not having you here.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.446
Okay.
I-I'm a little lost.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.348
Does that mean you miss me
or you don't miss me?

18:04.350 --> 18:06.117
Listen,
I just poured my heart out.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.718
Don't make me
repeat it twice.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.121
Listen, if selling boats
isn't working out,

18:10.123 --> 18:12.056
I'd be very happy
if you went back

18:12.058 --> 18:14.125
To running errands
and making coffee.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.960
Well, if I did that,
you'd be losing

18:15.962 --> 18:18.196
Your number-one boat salesman
at outdoor man.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.364
At least till dave
gets back from lunch.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.934
Well, that's -- seriously?
You sold a boat?

18:22.936 --> 18:25.436
Yeah. Must be all that
jalapeño cheese I'm eating,

18:25.438 --> 18:26.671
Because I am on fire.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.608
23-foot sea mistress,
fishing gear...
What?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.610
...Life preservers,
and a snow mobile.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.445
Snow mobile?
Nice add-on.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.215
Congratulations, Kyle.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.951
I wouldn't be lying if I didn't
say I wasn't impressed.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.154
Thank you
or I'm sorry.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.755
The most important thing is,

18:44.757 --> 18:47.258
Finally mrs. B.
Is gonna think I'm worthy.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.427
Well, that must make you
feel good.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.996
Well, I'm sure it's gonna make
mrs. B. Feel great about me.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.265
How does a sale like this
make you feel?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.533
Truly horrible.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.071
Like there's a permanent stain
on my soul.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.506
All right.
Here's what I heard.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.274
"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.143
You sold a boat."

19:05.145 --> 19:08.779
The customer was this old guy
on a fixed income.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.948
He had such kind eyes,

19:10.950 --> 19:12.950
Just like that
little baby...Something

19:12.952 --> 19:14.452
I picked out
of your tire.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.254
So, you hate
what you're doing,

19:16.256 --> 19:19.423
But you don't want to
disappoint my wife.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.460
Been there.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.628
It's okay, mr. B.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.297
I guess I'll get used
to hating myself.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.099
Maybe we can find you
a job around here

19:28.101 --> 19:29.967
Where you don't die a little bit
each day.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.170
Oh, come on.
It's only just a little dying.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.305
I mean, the kid's
a great boat salesman.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.473
No. I'm not great.

19:35.475 --> 19:39.377
But you know who would be is --
is jeff is clothing.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
He's a really good salesman.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.214
Well, I guess
I'll have a job to fill

19:43.216 --> 19:44.448
In the clothing department.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.450
Well, you know who has
a real eye for fashion

19:46.452 --> 19:48.052
Is javier
down on the loading dock.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.221
Big javier
or skinny javier?

19:50.223 --> 19:51.622
Oh, skinny javier.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.291
But between you and me,

19:53.293 --> 19:55.660
He picks out
big javier's outfits.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.129
You seem to know
who's good at what around here.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.798
Yeah. I-I float
from department to department.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
People always seem glad
to see me.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.236
It's because
of his uncanny resemblance

20:05.238 --> 20:06.470
To a golden retriever.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.472
Thank you.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.074
You know
what this sounds like?

20:10.076 --> 20:11.976
Sounds like
a sales-floor coordinator.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.011
What's
a sales-floor coordinator?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.881
Kyle's new job.
Congratulations.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.617
What's happening?

20:21.153 --> 20:23.321
We just gave Kyle
a promotion.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.655
Again?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.658
Yeah. He can advise us
about who fits in what job best

20:27.660 --> 20:29.860
By floating department
to department,

20:29.862 --> 20:31.262
Doing various jobs,

20:31.264 --> 20:33.564
Including, if it's all right,
making Ed's coffee.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.333
So he's still a floater.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.934
Nope.
Didn't you hear him?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.237
I am the new
sales-floor coordinator.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.906
Which means I should make
more money, right?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.108
You know, "should"
is a fancy word, Kyle.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.912
Mm, not really.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.681
I suppose we could talk about
a raise, right, Ed?

20:50.683 --> 20:52.250
What's happening?

21:00.125 --> 21:01.692
Hey, honey.
Hey.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.927
Hey. Guess what --

21:02.929 --> 21:05.696
The ecosystem
has been restored at work.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.932
No more flooding,
no more devastation.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.533
Mm. You know, I guess I just got
a little carried away

21:09.535 --> 21:10.701
Trying to make things right
with Kyle.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.969
I know you did.
Yeah.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.372
But you were right.
The kid does have
some potential.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.473
Good.
Well, thank you.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.308
So, you're no longer
the playful elephant

21:17.310 --> 21:18.643
Or the well-meaning
bighead.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.944
[ chuckles ] that's sweet.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.445
Now you're
the lucky octopus.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.215
Oh.
That's the octopus that picks
all the winning soccer teams.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.783
I'll take it. Fine.
Good. Good.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.917
Wait, wait, wa-wait.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.286
Where are you going
with the cereal?

21:28.288 --> 21:30.421
I'm gonna put them
in my gun safe.
