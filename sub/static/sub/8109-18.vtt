WEBVTT

00:25.651 --> 00:27.107
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

00:27.611 --> 00:29.101
(SIGHS) Who is it?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.231
It's Tom.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.822
Tom, your husband?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.244
What's he doing here?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.997
Uh, what's going on?

00:46.088 --> 00:47.294
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.248
But Evelyn's
school contract
is due tomorrow.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.833
I knew I was
forgetting something.
Let me find a pen.

00:52.928 --> 00:53.963
(CLEARING THROAT)

00:56.890 --> 00:57.970
Hey.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.093
Hey.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.765
Not quite sure what
Emily Post recommends

01:00.852 --> 01:02.843
in this situation,
but I'm Tom.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.137
Damien. Hi.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.478
Sorry to intrude, | just...
I wasn't quite sure
when she'd be coming home.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.650
No problem.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.568
Thank you so much
for catching this.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.896
Yeah.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.281
I'll get out of your way.
It was good to meet you,

01:17.369 --> 01:18.859
and I'll see you
later, hon.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.160
Bye.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.498
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:28.839 --> 01:30.921
So, he seems
like a nice guy.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.214
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:32.718 --> 01:33.833
Ooh.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.006
Jules, you okay?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.177
No, my stomach...

01:38.265 --> 01:39.675
Here, lie down.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.175
(GROANING) Ow!

01:44.271 --> 01:45.681
Try to...

01:45.731 --> 01:47.221
Get Tom.
Okay.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.014
Ow!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.189
DAMIEN: Tom!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.939
(PANTING)

02:26.396 --> 02:27.431
You know what
would be perfect?

02:27.522 --> 02:28.477
Hmm.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.476
French Toast Tower.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.229
You still go to Mickey's?
What's your cholesterol?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.686
It's my one vice.
I'm keeping it.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.739
As much as I would love
to clog my arteries,

02:38.825 --> 02:44.115
l have a 10:00 CT,
and I still have to
race home, get changed.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.911
Maybe you could keep
some clothes here.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.088
Maybe I could.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.882
He's just trying to
get into your skirts,

02:56.968 --> 02:59.300
and I don't mean
metaphorically.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.004
Well, he's got
the legs for it.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.009
So, lwill
see you tonight?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.435
Yeah.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.778
Bye, House.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.113
Have a nice day.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.909
"Have a nice day"?
How civilized.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.202
I said I'd
stay out of it.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.041
What?
Nothing.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.460
Clearly something.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.627
Nope.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.251
House, on a list
of your attributes,

03:36.341 --> 03:39.253
there's nothing that
even rhymes with "coy."

03:39.344 --> 03:43.428
Okay, I may have
seen something
in the fridge.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.631
Like the end of
your relationship.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.098
She put the milk
in the door and
not on the shelf.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.564
It's not a big deal.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.434
You hate that she did that,
but you didn't say anything.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.560
(LAUGHS)

03:54.651 --> 03:55.731
You're trying to
get us to fight.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.936
No, I'm trying to help.
If you got an issue,
let her know.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.443
I should've known
that you weren't done
sabotaging this.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.276
Fine.
Stew in your irritation.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.032
Sure,
last time it bubbled over
into resentment and rage,

04:08.123 --> 04:09.829
leading ultimately
to a painful divorce

04:09.916 --> 04:13.249
that neither of you have
ever really recovered from,

04:13.336 --> 04:16.203
but I'm sure this time,
it'll be great.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.765
Interesting case,
35-year-old woman

04:29.853 --> 04:31.138
with fever and
abdominal pain.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.481
ER ruled out all
the usual suspects.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.732
And she's in
an open marriage.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.895
That's not interesting.
It's just weird.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.069
HOUSE: Know what's weirder?

04:42.157 --> 04:45.115
That other humans
are monogamous
in the first place.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.613
No other species
on the planet
mates for life,

04:47.704 --> 04:49.114
andifyouTe
gonna bring up swans,

04:49.206 --> 04:50.571
they cheat like
everybody else.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.576
They just have better
PR than rabbits.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.500
Animals also eat their young
and kill their rivals.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.418
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

04:57.506 --> 04:59.246
Says the guy
whose opposable thumbs

04:59.341 --> 05:01.923
have been all over
how many women
who aren't his wife?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.296
A functional open marriage
is like a unicorn.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.968
It's a mythical creature
that doesn't exist.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.421
Someone always
ends up unhappy.

05:07.516 --> 05:11.805
Our patient's unhappy
because she's suffering
from an intestinal blockage.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.978
Boring. Now, I'm gonna
have to find a reason
to rule it out.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.805
What about
herpes colitis?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.016
She picks up
the infection from
one of her partners.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.145
It takes root
in her colon.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.272
STD panel was clean.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.319
Chances are this
couple was unhappy
in the first place.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.489
This is their attempt
to save something
that never...

05:30.914 --> 05:31.994
Go on.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.245
Herpes might not register
if she was exposed
in the last six weeks.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.712
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.336
Wait.
You're going to do it?

05:43.426 --> 05:47.965
Gotta see if our patient
is a unicorn or
just a slutty horse.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.469
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.927
HOUSE: Barium coats
the inner lining
of your colon,

05:55.021 --> 05:58.013
lets us get a good
look at it on the X-ray.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.518
I can get somebody else
to pick up Evelyn.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.349
I feel like I'm
abandoning you.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.025
I'm on painkillers.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.353
I'd rather this not be
what you think of

06:04.447 --> 06:07.780
every time you
look at my butt.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.781
Okay,
roll onto your side.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.909
lt's fill 'er up time.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.289
(EXHALES)

06:25.093 --> 06:28.210
So, is Evelyn
his new squeeze?

06:28.305 --> 06:29.545
She's our daughter.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.927
Must be interesting,
growing up in a production
of Oh! Calcutta!

06:33.018 --> 06:34.758
She's six.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.560
She knows as much
about our sex life as
any other kid her age.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.893
You can explain
that she's the reason

06:40.984 --> 06:42.144
the two of you
stayed married.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.226
You've been in the room
five minutes.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.357
You got us
all figured out.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.439
Of course,
you left out the part
where we love each other,

06:48.533 --> 06:50.489
and we wanna
grow old together.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.987
But you just don't
wanna be young together.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.943
Look, when you
think about it,

06:54.039 --> 06:55.904
tons of couples
do what we do.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.114
It's just that
with most of them,

06:57.208 --> 06:59.870
one spouse doesn't
know about it.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.246
We decided
things work better

07:01.338 --> 07:04.250
when people tell
each other the truth.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.500
Tank's full.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.261
lWlpage
the radiology elves.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.761
I'm not saying I hate it.
It just doesn't go
with your eyes.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.890
You hate it.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.221
Little bit.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.558
Any more heartless critiques
of my general appearance?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.018
MAYA: Nope. All done.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.315
So, is she
as bendy as she looks?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.693
Maya and l
are just friends.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.278
No, you and l
are friends.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.409
And you don't
have coffee with me
three times a week.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.491
She's an
interesting person.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.576
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.413
Fascinating. Last week
that Cambodian lab tech
was telling us

07:45.507 --> 07:47.338
how he survived
the Killing Fields,

07:47.425 --> 07:49.211
and you left to
go get a donut.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.838
So we flirt.
It's fun.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.135
lt's dangerous.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.053
That woman would
totally do you.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.880
You think?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.136
Nothing is gonna happen.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.058
All I'm saying is,
if you want to be
on a diet,

07:59.145 --> 08:03.104
you might want to
stop hanging out
by the dessert cart.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.309
X-ray was clean.
She doesn't have
herpes colitis.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.644
Or abdominal pain.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.569
TAUB:
lt stopped hurting
during the X-ray,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.739
which means it was just
an intestinal blockage
that passed.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.815
We should
discharge her.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.323
Absolutely,
there's no need to find
any underlying cause.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.951
These things
never happen twice.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.157
Take her digestive system
for a test drive.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.992
Give her
a radio-opaque milkshake.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.668
X-ray every 15 minutes
to see if it makes

08:25.755 --> 08:28.007
any unscheduled stops
on the way through.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.206
We'll be here all night.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.507
No, Taub will
be here all night.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.086
Go talk to the unicorn,
then tell me
you don't believe.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.593
I did an abdominal CT
on a kid today,

08:37.684 --> 08:41.472
and found a six-inch bezoar
made entirely of gum.

08:41.563 --> 08:45.556
I mean,
who gives a three-year-old
an endless supply of gum...

08:50.113 --> 08:51.193
You okay?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.270
Yeah.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.784
I mean,
there was hair in it and
maybe a piece of paper.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.199
So, how long have
you been married?

09:05.795 --> 09:08.832
One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.710
Nobody ever asks me
about current events
or the weather.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.376
The Yankees look
good this season.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.211
(LAUGHING)

09:17.932 --> 09:19.547
Seven years.

09:19.642 --> 09:24.477
And how long have you,
you know...

09:25.440 --> 09:27.271
After three years,
we realized

09:27.358 --> 09:30.225
that traditional marriage
was making us both miserable.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.024
Most people get divorced
at that point.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.104
Yeah, we didn't want
to get divorced.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.406
We still loved
each other.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.985
We just realized that
expecting one person

09:40.080 --> 09:42.662
to fulfill all of
your needs forever
is unrealistic.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.241
There are happy
monogamous couples
out there.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.873
Sure, one or two have
the perfect marriage.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.376
Everybody else has
figured out how
to settle for less.

09:52.467 --> 09:56.756
I don't want to settle
and end up resenting
my husband.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.929
I'd rather get the 10%
he doesn't give me
somewhere else

10:00.016 --> 10:05.181
so that I can
really appreciate him
for the 90% he does.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.226
(HEART MONITOR BEEPING)

10:09.317 --> 10:11.854
I think something's wrong.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.435
With your stomach?
My heart is racing.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.902
(MONITOR BEEPING FASTER)

10:14.989 --> 10:16.980
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

10:19.160 --> 10:23.574
Try to take deep breaths.
I'm gonna try to
slow your heart down.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.243
Is this because
of the blockage?

10:26.334 --> 10:27.619
No. It's not working.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.745
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

10:28.837 --> 10:30.998
Need a crash cart
in here!

10:36.636 --> 10:40.925
CHASE: I need a list of
all your sexual partners
from the last six months.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.095
VVhy?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.389
Your wife had
an arrhythmia.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.637
The progression
of symptoms
from bowel to heart

10:45.728 --> 10:47.639
makes a parasitic
infection most likely.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.641
Since Julia hasn't been
out of the country...

10:49.732 --> 10:50.812
The only place that
I've been recently

10:50.900 --> 10:52.481
is a business trip
to Nebraska.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.560
But either of you could
have picked up a bug

10:54.654 --> 10:56.190
from one
of your partners.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.566
(SIGHS)

10:58.408 --> 11:01.616
It's kind of complicated.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.070
How many partners
are we talking about?
Ballpark.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.822
None.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.248
None?

11:09.335 --> 11:13.248
We have a great sex life.
I don't need anyone else.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.204
So why not
just tell her that

11:15.300 --> 11:16.665
and close this
whole thing up?

11:16.759 --> 11:17.839
You married?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.213
(STUTTERING) I was.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.842
Did you ever agree to
go see a chick flick
with your wife

11:22.932 --> 11:24.763
or pretend to
enjoy classical music?

11:24.851 --> 11:28.810
Stravinsky
never groped my wife
in a Midtown hotel room.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.104
She needs this.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.809
I don't,
but I don't want her
to feel bad about that.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.271
HOUSE: He's lying.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.696
CHASE: Guy's got
a license to drill.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.694
Why would he lie
about not using it?

11:42.785 --> 11:43.865
That's not the lie.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.695
The lie is that
he gives a crap
how his wife feels.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.780
If they're both
screwing around,
that's one thing.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.911
But she has
a piece on the side,
and he doesn't?

11:51.002 --> 11:52.412
The only way he'd
be okay with that

11:52.503 --> 11:54.539
is if he's betraying her
in some other way.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.417
Then in his mind,
it makes them even.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.884
My unicorn isn't a unicorn.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.254
It's a donkey
with a plunger
stuck to its face.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.302
Right, even a guy
who's not cheating

12:03.389 --> 12:05.300
is doing it for
underhanded reasons.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.972
No,no,no,
he's not being cynical.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.847
He's assuming the husband
is doing something
to even the score.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.554
Which means he thinks
there is a score.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.640
Which means,
cheating swans aside,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.725
House believes
in monogamy.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.730
He's being romantic.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.359
What I believe is
that men are genetically
engineered to be jealous.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.283
Doesn't matter if
I think there's a score.
I guarantee you he does.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.826
Any of the wife's
partners pan out?

12:27.205 --> 12:30.117
She's been with two people
other than Tom
in the last six months.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.244
Neither of them
have been outside
the Tri-State area.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.575
So we're back
to the husband.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.705
You just said you
believed he wasn't...

12:34.796 --> 12:36.787
He's doing something
behind her back.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.668
What better cover
than a business
trip to Nebraska?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.715
Like that's
really a place.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.424
CHASE: Let's find
his travel records
and get back to work.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.425
You seem pretty mellow
about this couple's deal.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.136
Thought you'd
be first in line
to shake a finger.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.189
They're still married.
I'm not.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.267
Not that I could
everdoit

12:58.361 --> 13:01.228
I was jealous of House,
and Cameron
never touched him.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.029
Not counting
the emotional
fondHng.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.785
When my mom was dying,
my dad had an affair.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.787
He told you this?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.126
I'd seen them
get out of his car.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.871
Two years after Mom died,
they got married.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.619
Must've sucked.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.625
At the time, yeah,

13:19.716 --> 13:23.254
but looking back,
it makes sense.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.550
My mom never
knew about it,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.969
and he needed someone
to make him feel less alone.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.638
He took care of my mom,
day in and day out,

13:29.726 --> 13:31.466
for two and a half years
before she died.

13:31.561 --> 13:35.770
He was devoted to her.
Loving someone else
didn't change that.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.143
So loving two people
at once is fine

13:38.234 --> 13:39.644
as long as
one of them is dying?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.727
VVhoeveﬂs
taking care of me
when I get sick,

13:41.821 --> 13:45.405
I hope they've
got someone else
to take care of them.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.530
Tom was
telling the truth.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.747
He really did go
to Nebraska.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.493
Plane ticket and
restaurant receipts.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.415
THIRTEEN: Forget Nebraska.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.412
Maybe they just
bought their parasites
at the mall.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.421
You know, we should really
throw away that loofah.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.342
They're imported.
Sometimes they're
not sterilized.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.546
We think our patient got
amoebiasis from hers.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.631
She going to be okay?

14:11.726 --> 14:13.341
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.180
It's actually
kind of bizarre.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.562
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.323
They sleep
with other people?

14:26.407 --> 14:29.615
Well, she does.
Her husband's
totally fine with it.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.737
That's crazy, right?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.578
And you're bringing
this up because...

14:40.296 --> 14:43.709
I thought
it was interesting.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.961
More interesting
than your other cases,
Iguess.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.845
You talk about
your colleagues.
You rant about House.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.594
You don't usually
mention your patients.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.725
ls open marriage
something you want?

14:59.816 --> 15:02.057
No. I mean...

15:04.821 --> 15:07.187
I know you'd never...

15:10.076 --> 15:11.191
(SIGHS)

15:11.285 --> 15:14.072
All this time and
energy you spent

15:14.163 --> 15:16.575
convincing me
you weren't cheating.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.781
And there's
somebody else.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.083
I'm not...
WAITER: Would you like
some more water, sir?

15:32.515 --> 15:33.800
Okay.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.602
There's a woman at work.
People say she's
attracted to me.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.101
But nothing's happened.
Nothing's going to happen.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.692
I'm not having an affair.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.277
But you want to.

15:45.361 --> 15:49.274
No, honey,
I'm trying to be honest.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.448
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.321
Be honest then.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.872
Are you attracted to her?

16:01.878 --> 16:06.793
Look, she's attractive.
There's an attraction.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.590
Aren't there men who
make you feel that way?

16:09.677 --> 16:10.917
Of course, there are.

16:11.012 --> 16:15.176
But it never occurs
to me to act on it,
because I'm married.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.428
To you.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.636
And that's enough for me.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.846
Aren't I enough for you?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.680
Of course, you are.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.356
(PAGER BEEPING)

16:28.738 --> 16:31.150
Our patient's lost
all movement in her legs.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.649
There are other doctors,
Chris. We're talking.

16:35.703 --> 16:39.571
I'm sorry.
The woman's paralyzed.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.536
I'll get a cab.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.973
TAUB: Tests show
no spinal cord injury,

16:59.060 --> 17:01.051
no cerebral lesions,
no hemorrhage.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.431
CHASE: We finally
got a stool sample.
The Ioofah's innocent.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.185
No sign of amoebas
or any other parasite.

17:06.275 --> 17:10.109
So paralysis, arrhythmia,
intermittent abdominal pain.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.313
And he nicked
himself shaving.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.494
Sorry, that was Taub.
But it was easier
to solve.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.696
Means he used
the crappy razor
in his locker,

17:21.791 --> 17:23.076
which means
he slept here.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.247
Thanks to you.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.579
I brought up open marriage
with Rachel.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.834
It was a disaster.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.670
On the medical front,
we've knocked out
sex and foreign travel.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.756
Could be
an electrolyte imbalance.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.465
So the only time
you're not interested

17:41.561 --> 17:42.767
in my marriage is
after you blow it up?

17:42.853 --> 17:45.640
You were the moron
who took marital advice
from Tila Tequila.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.267
You pushed me
into this.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.815
Figured it would either
blow up your marriage
or make it more honest.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.358
Either way, you win.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.276
What about sex?

17:53.364 --> 17:54.399
I'm talking
about the patient.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.525
Is that cool
with everybody?

17:55.616 --> 17:56.696
We ruled out sex.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.991
We ruled out sex
with other people.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.785
Tom said he and Julia
have been doing it
three or four times a week.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.703
And she's got
boys on the side.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.204
Increased libido
can be a symptom of
adrenocortical carcinoma,

18:07.295 --> 18:09.160
which also explains
her other symptoms.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.497
A woman who likes sex
must be sick?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.048
HOUSE: Just because
everybody in this room

18:14.135 --> 18:17.878
wishes that all women
were horny all the time
doesn't make it so.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.929
Get an MRI of
her adrenal glands.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.731
Hi.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.643
Okay if I take
the sports page?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.103
WILSON: Sure.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.741
Would you mind
using a coaster?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.615
Oh. Sure. Sorry.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.824
It's okay.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.793
Also, it'd be great
if you'd replace

18:55.885 --> 18:57.500
the toilet paper
when you finish a roll.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.176
And when you load
the dishwasher,

18:59.263 --> 19:01.640
you can't put a big,
flat bowl on the bottom.

19:01.724 --> 19:05.182
It traps the water
so nothing on the top
gets clean.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.601
And please don't
throw banana peels
in the bedroom trash...

19:07.688 --> 19:11.021
I haven't done
any of those things.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.723
You're probably
not even aware...

19:12.818 --> 19:13.978
I hate bananas.

19:20.201 --> 19:23.034
Oh, my God.
It was House.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.328
I'm sorry.
He's been trying
to get us to fight.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.622
Why would he think
that stuff would
make us fight?

19:28.709 --> 19:32.622
Because of the milk.
You put it in the door.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.546
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.839
The temperature in
the door fluctuates,

19:36.926 --> 19:37.961
which decreases
shelf life...

19:38.052 --> 19:41.965
Wow. When did
you get all OCD?

19:44.517 --> 19:45.632
so we can all
stay healthy.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.426
Oh. It's about health?

19:48.521 --> 19:53.015
What about the coaster?
Does that replenish
my B12 or something?

19:53.109 --> 19:54.189
Can we just drop it?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.356
Sure.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.405
You have this
list of annoyances

20:05.496 --> 20:07.737
the entire time
we were married?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.786
Get better, Mommy.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.667
I love you, rabbit.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.005
Julia, you have a guest.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.799
Hi.
This isn't a good time.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.008
Dr. Hadley, did you say
there was a video game
in the playroom?

20:29.103 --> 20:31.936
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them?

20:32.022 --> 20:33.353
See you in Radiology.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.394
Get out of
my wife's room.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.354
Your relationship with her
stays out of our space.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.656
I was worried about her.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.155
Tom's right.
You should go.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.411
So it's fine
if we have sex,

20:49.498 --> 20:50.999
but if I drop by
to see if you're okay...

20:51.083 --> 20:53.415
This is our family.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.247
Sorry.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.177
I spent two years
of residency

21:09.268 --> 21:11.304
wearing shirts that
were a size too small.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.182
How hard is it
to ask me not to put
them in the dryer?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.559
And I only did your laundry
because you were never home.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.730
I didn't ask you to.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.274
Of course you didn't.
You just got annoyed

21:19.361 --> 21:21.067
whenever you didn't
have clean undenNear.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.235
I never said
I was annoyed.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.939
That's the point.
You didn't say anything.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.990
So I'm getting a lecture
on communication

21:27.077 --> 21:30.240
from someone who
had her lawyer inform me
our marriage was over.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.868
Asking for an open marriage.
You got stones.

21:36.962 --> 21:41.376
Conversation sort of
got away from me.
It was a train wreck.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.798
I think it's good
you brought it up.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.126
I read a study
that found men who
have multiple copies

21:45.221 --> 21:46.552
of a certain
vasopressin receptor

21:46.639 --> 21:49.130
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.341
Maybe you're just
one of those guys.

21:51.435 --> 21:55.474
So my cheating is
biologically predetermined.
Fantastic.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.976
Multiply times five.
We need a better look
at the medulla.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.182
I thought
you'd be relieved.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.062
This gets you
off the hook.
It's just genetics.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.565
I'm 5'6" and have
a receding hairline.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.022
I hate genetics.
Medulla's clean.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.777
I don't see you wearing
lifts or hair plugs.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.904
That's because
being short and bald
doesn't hurt anybody.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.657
The only thing hurtful
about your other
genetic predisposition

22:12.748 --> 22:14.284
is that you keep
denying it.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.661
It's not good
for you or Rachel.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.582
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.209
And maybe you're
right about me,

22:22.299 --> 22:23.505
but I'm not going
to stop trying.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.752
Rachel's worth it.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.803
Look up there.
Thelung.
What is that?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.630
You served me
with divorce papers

22:31.725 --> 22:33.761
in the middle of
a medical conference
in New Orleans!

22:33.853 --> 22:35.684
I threw a bottle
into an antique mirror.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.478
You exhibited an emotion.
lwish I'd known
you were capable.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.601
I loved you.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.853
I thought I was
gonna be following you
to Baltimore, remember?

22:41.944 --> 22:44.276
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.024
How could you think
that we still had
a real marriage?

22:46.115 --> 22:47.855
We hadn't had
a conversation in months.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.032
Maybe because
I was working two jobs
to support us.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.235
No! No, it's because
when you were home,

22:52.329 --> 22:53.830
it was like talking
to a block of ice.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.700
You were obviously
so pissed off at me...

22:55.791 --> 22:58.533
I was killing myself
so that you could take
that non-paying internship.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.707
That you said
that I should take.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.784
I was trying to
be supportive!

23:00.880 --> 23:01.869
Why do I have to
be the bad guy?

23:01.964 --> 23:04.376
Expressing yourself
does not make you
the bad guy.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.594
Okay, then, you were
being a selfish bitch.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.297
(SCOFFS)

23:09.805 --> 23:12.512
VlQ scan confirmed the spot
on Julia's lung was a clot.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.344
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

23:15.436 --> 23:18.803
If he has a secret,
I highly doubt it's more
relevant than the clot.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.388
Clotting disorder
would explain everything.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.437
(DOOR OPENS)

23:21.525 --> 23:22.901
Question is, which one?

23:22.985 --> 23:26.068
Do you read any of
your departmental memos?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.066
Only the ones
labeled NSFW.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.866
Accounting notified you
two days ago about
your patient's insurance.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.943
Sorry. That's N NSFW.

23:34.038 --> 23:38.077
Here. He doesn't have any.
Try not to bankrupt them.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.751
I'm long past
the number of procedures
that'll bankrupt them.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.249
Julia's got insurance.
I saw the policy number
on the forms.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.331
The policy lapsed
due to non-payment.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.881
I already made
three calls about this.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.084
She should have
been aware of that.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.132
No, that's just
a mistake.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.013
Of course we have
health insurance.

23:59.521 --> 24:03.514
We're actually
a little behind
on the premiums.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.150
But I pulled money out
of my retirement account
to cover it.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.647
They said that
we'll be fine
in a few...

24:08.739 --> 24:11.776
Why the retirement account?

24:13.619 --> 24:16.736
We'll just give you
a few minutes to...

24:16.830 --> 24:19.207
By ”We,”
she means "she."

24:21.669 --> 24:24.081
I lost all of
our savings.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.381
Sounds like
a secret to me.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.263
I started her on heparin
to prevent further clots,

24:36.350 --> 24:38.056
but we still don't know
what's going on.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.304
Of course the husband's
secret was money.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.352
If it's not sex,
it's always money.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.896
Unless it's sex
for money.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.019
How did he lose it
anyway?

24:46.110 --> 24:48.271
It's not medically relevant.
You're not going to care.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.273
Wilson's been teaching me
how to care. Try me.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.697
He builds wind turbines
and leases them out
to local power companies...

24:53.784 --> 24:55.240
You're right.
I don't care.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.366
Clotting disorder.
DIC, Factor V Leiden,
Antiphospholipid syndrome.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.037
Vitamin K deficiency
also fits,

25:01.125 --> 25:03.207
causes thrombophilia
and is consistent
with abdominal pain.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.911
Congratulations, House.
Sam ended it.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.245
What happened?

25:08.924 --> 25:10.664
Go test
our patient's blood.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.044
It can wait
five minutes.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.422
For everything
we discussed.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.850
(SIGHS)

25:20.352 --> 25:22.388
I'm sorry.

25:22.479 --> 25:26.472
Well, at least you're
actually taking responsibility
for once in your life.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.980
I'm sorry that she left,
but it's not my fault.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.480
I didn't even want
to get involved.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.652
You dragged it
out of me.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.729
(SCOFFS)

25:33.824 --> 25:36.657
What about the dishwasher
and the banana?

25:36.744 --> 25:39.702
Yeah, she left
because of the banana.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.698
I just wanted you to
stand up for yourself,
tell her what you want.

25:43.792 --> 25:47.455
If doing that
causes her to walk out
for the second time,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.628
well, then your relationship
wasn't going to last anyway.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.205
Or you could've
stayed out of it.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.415
I could've kept
my mouth shut,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.215
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy,

25:54.303 --> 25:56.760
because I'd
still be with her.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.213
Now all I have
is cold milk.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.767
As long as you're free,
you want to grab some dinner?

26:08.358 --> 26:10.565
THIRTEEN: Did Tom go home
for the night?

26:10.652 --> 26:14.395
For starters.
I told him to leave.
I don't want him here.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.733
Money is
a complicated subject.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.488
Yeah, it's not the money.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.661
I mean,
the money is bad, but...

26:22.748 --> 26:25.160
(SIGHS)

26:27.294 --> 26:28.579
When we first
opened our marriage,

26:28.670 --> 26:32.288
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.798
And one day,
his wife calls me.

26:34.885 --> 26:39.754
She's crying, and screaming,
and totally out of control.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.714
And I felt

26:44.561 --> 26:45.767
supenor

26:46.814 --> 26:49.021
I thought, "I don't
ever have to worry
about feeling this way,

26:49.108 --> 26:52.726
"because Tom and I
are honest
with each other."

26:55.447 --> 26:57.859
Well, here I am.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.695
Hi.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.625
Sorry I didn't make it
home last night.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.751
Ineededto
run some tests.

27:14.842 --> 27:19.677
You know what
the worst part was
when you had your affair?

27:20.848 --> 27:23.510
It wasn't the sex.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.589
It was the lies.

27:26.395 --> 27:32.482
Realizing that
the narrative of my life
was totally wrong.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.650
You weren't
stuck in surgery.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.727
You weren't
out of town.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.239
I don't wanna go
through that again.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.741
I told you,
nothing's going...

27:42.828 --> 27:44.159
Thursday nights.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.581
You have to be home
by midnight.

27:49.668 --> 27:54.037
You don't bring her here,
you don't talk
to her about me,

27:54.131 --> 27:57.840
and I don't want
to meet her ever
in any context.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.677
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

28:08.770 --> 28:11.432
It's what you want,
isn't it?

28:11.523 --> 28:13.138
I want you.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.892
No, you want
more than me.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.194
You want that thrill.

28:22.117 --> 28:27.453
But I love you,
and I really believe
that you love me.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.030
And we have
a good life together.

28:30.125 --> 28:34.539
And at this point,
either I walk away,

28:34.630 --> 28:37.372
or I try to accept
who you really are.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.837
Tomorrow's Thursday.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.294
Yes, it is.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.848
THIRTEEN: All our tests
came back negative.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.725
It's not
a clotting disorder.

28:53.815 --> 28:57.103
Which means
we need to come up
with a better idea.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.107
So what causes problems
in the stomach,
heart, nerves...

29:02.741 --> 29:04.527
Oh, my God.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.989

but not the stink of shame.

You've got a date?

29:22.552 --> 29:27.342
I am going out

with Rachel's blessing.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.386
Maze! tov?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.094
Maybe the problem
isn't her blood.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.850
Maybe it's the vessels
carrying the blood.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.681
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.438
So you're
actually going to sleep
with another woman,

29:40.529 --> 29:41.769
then go home
to your wife?

29:41.863 --> 29:44.855
Thank God someone's
keeping us focused on
what's really important.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.111
Taub was going to do
all of that anyway.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.817
Pulmonary
arterial hypertension?

29:48.912 --> 29:52.370
Imaging showed
normal diameter
in her pulmonary artery.

29:52.457 --> 29:57.542
Here's a thought.
Taub's wife is now
totally on the market.

with her digits?

came back another day.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.661
Question is,
what brought it back?

30:33.749 --> 30:36.741
Physical exam
was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.824
So afterwards,
you gonna shower

30:37.919 --> 30:39.170
at your girlfriend's
or at home?

30:39.254 --> 30:41.085
Patient. Abdominal pain.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.415
Yeah, he's right.
Let's get this
wrapped up before 6:00.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.886
Taub turns back into
a faithful pumpkin
at midnight.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.087
The patient was
out with her boy-toy
before she came in.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.968
Maybe the pain
was triggered
by sexual excitement.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.721
Because lying alone
in a hospital bed,

30:54.811 --> 30:56.893
contemplating
bankruptcy? Hot.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.141
My point was that
arousal is a function

30:59.232 --> 31:00.847
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.352
If that's where
the problem is,

31:02.444 --> 31:04.230
the pain could be
triggered by crying,
which seems...

31:04.321 --> 31:06.858
PNS also controls digestion,
which she's been doing

31:06.948 --> 31:09.030
without
screaming her head off
since she's been here.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.779
What if what matters isn't
when the pain started,
but when it stopped?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.236
It was during an X-ray.
You think that cured her?

31:14.331 --> 31:17.198
No, but House
prepped her for the X-ray
with a barium enema.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.123
That wouldn't treat
anything except...

31:22.005 --> 31:23.040
Go.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.214
You're in pain because
part of your intestine
folded in on itself.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.461
It's called
an intussusception.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.053
It's cutting off blood flow.
We need to fix it

31:29.137 --> 31:30.923

gets necrotic and dies.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.470
Once you do that,
will I get better?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.546
When this happens
in adults,

31:33.642 --> 31:35.132
it's usually a sign
of abdominal cancer.

and then search your
intestine for tumors.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.244
Nothing,
that's the beauty.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.122
I genuinely tried
to help Wilson.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.419
I told him to
stand up for himself,

32:04.506 --> 32:06.121
which you know is
legitimate advice.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.252
And his relationship
blew up.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.004
Is he okay?
He'll be fine.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.131

What if she's
going out, too?

32:50.886 --> 32:52.672
She's allowed to, right?

32:52.762 --> 32:55.629
Of course,
it's only fair.

32:55.724 --> 32:56.759
But I don't think
she will.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.221
Your wife only
eats dinner at home?

33:01.229 --> 33:05.563
If she did go out,
that'd be tough.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.982
But I think
I can handle it.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.354
Don't do it
unless you're sure.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.983
I know I'd rather be
jealous than a liar.

33:12.574 --> 33:16.442
Got something here.
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.401
CHASE: Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,

33:18.497 --> 33:20.078
which suggests IBD.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.201
Only that doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.283
Or her declining
kidney function.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.663
We ran panels
during surgery.

33:26.755 --> 33:30.339
Actually,
IBD does make sense,

33:30.425 --> 33:33.041
'cause it can trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

33:33.136 --> 33:35.468
which would
explain the heart
and the kidneys.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.843
Start her on sulfasalazine
and TNF-inhibitors.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.556
(ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS)

33:43.647 --> 33:45.012
Just remember,
if you get disoriented,

33:45.106 --> 33:46.186
(PAGER BEEPS)

33:46.274 --> 33:48.981
breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.624
I can't.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.786
I really thought
I could do this.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.209
Logically,
it makes perfect sense.

34:16.429 --> 34:19.921
But all afternoon,

34:21.309 --> 34:26.474
all I kept thinking about
was the two of you together,

34:27.691 --> 34:30.023
and you touching her...

34:30.110 --> 34:33.853
Nothing's happened.
It's okay.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.820
I'm sorry.

34:36.825 --> 34:37.985
(SOBBING)
'Cause I really wanted...

34:38.076 --> 34:39.657
No.

34:41.037 --> 34:45.906
I've been an idiot.
I don't need anything else.
I just need you.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.582
You mean that?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.043
I do.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.333
(SOBBING)

34:54.843 --> 34:56.208
I love you, Rachel.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.588
I love you, too.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.590
Let's go home.

34:59.681 --> 35:00.921
Is that okay?

35:02.225 --> 35:04.181
There are other doctors.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.394
FOREMAN: The treatment's
not working.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.819
Her left kidney
failed last night.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.066
The other one's
right behind it.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.365
It's not
ankylosing spondylitis.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.114
Kidney biopsy showed
she had IgA nephropathy,

35:23.204 --> 35:26.992
which could be caused by
or associated with
any of these conditions.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.335
We've gone from
too few ideas
to too many,

35:29.419 --> 35:31.626
and our patient is
running out of time.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.712
Why the lack
of afterglow?

35:34.799 --> 35:36.881
Physio girl not as freaky
as you'd hoped?

35:38.094 --> 35:39.174
I went home with my wife.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.251
(EXHALES)

35:40.347 --> 35:42.963
After all that?
You chickened out.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.679
I can't hurt
Rachel like that.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.386
Sickle cell anemia
would've shown
on blood tests.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.848
No flattened
intestinal villi
rules out celiac...

35:54.402 --> 35:56.438
Seriously? (LAUGHS)

35:56.529 --> 35:59.817
Our patient is dying,
and we can't move
past my sex life?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.694
Seriously?
You think it'd kill her

36:01.785 --> 36:03.776
if we spent 15 seconds
mocking you?

36:04.454 --> 36:05.864
Time's up.

36:05.955 --> 36:09.823
FOREMAN: Normal liver enzymes
rules out Hep B and cirrhosis.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.035
Alport and
Anti-GBM antibody
are both untreatable,

36:13.129 --> 36:15.245
so if she has them,
we can't help her.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.422
And it can't be
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.592
No inciting respiratory
infection and no rash.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.839
I don't care
what it's not.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.045
I wanna know
what it could be.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.222
Well, everything
left on the list.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.470
The list was
not created equal.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.846
Neither was man,
by the way.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.180
Hemochromatosis
is a possibility.
Excess iron builds up,

36:33.274 --> 36:34.434
causes problems
throughout the body.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.609
Weil's Syndrome also affects
multiple organ systems.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.186
And it wouldn't
have been treated

36:39.280 --> 36:41.191
by the antibiotic
the ER gave her.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.694
Sarcoidosis
makes sense, too.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.822
Good.
Treat for those three.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.584
I think
you should call Tom.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.620
Am I going to die?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.339
I don't know.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.876
If he walked in here
right now,

37:02.971 --> 37:05.883
I'd look at his face,
and all I would
think is "liar."

37:05.974 --> 37:08.215
Don't you think
that's kind of unfair?

37:08.309 --> 37:09.765
You say honesty
is all-important,

37:09.853 --> 37:11.218
but you conveniently
ignore the truth

37:11.312 --> 37:13.724
that some truths
hurt people.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.397
Tom lied to protect you.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.696
I'm not talking
about the money.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.908
Tom hasn't slept
with anyone else
in over a year.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.912
He told you that?

37:33.126 --> 37:35.742
So my entire marriage
is a sham.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.247
No.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.705
Your husband,
who only wants you,

37:40.800 --> 37:42.540
lied so that
you could be happy.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.051
That seems
pretty real to me.

37:49.642 --> 37:50.768
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

37:50.852 --> 37:51.841
Yeah?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.521
Hey.
Hey.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.946
Listen, I'm sorry.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.198
Me, too.
I shouldn't have said...

38:11.289 --> 38:14.247
No. You were right.
I was selfish back then.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.085
I'm trying to change.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.039
And I don't know if
it's House or what,

38:23.468 --> 38:24.833
but you're different, too.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.635
I'm trying.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.134
(SIGHS)

38:31.226 --> 38:35.185
I always thought that
I was keeping the peace.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.598
and giving you
a reason to leave.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.240
I wish we had this fight
10 years ago.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.498
Is it okay if we don't
give House the credit?

38:57.585 --> 38:59.086
(EXCLAIMS)

38:59.170 --> 39:00.159
I recommend it.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.870
(CHUCKLES)

39:08.346 --> 39:11.053
0-for-3,
her kidney function
is still declining.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.347
We're going to need
to start dialysis.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.220
HOUSE: Glad
the husband's back.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.222
After missing
so many little deaths,

39:17.313 --> 39:19.178
he should be here
for the big one.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.559
Top six, anyone?

39:20.650 --> 39:22.390
Polyarteritis Nodosa?

39:22.485 --> 39:25.773
We would've seen
some improvement
on prednisone.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.652
Guy's wife is dying.
He stops to buy flowers.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.530
They're from his garden.
Mercury poisoning fits.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.452
Those are lilacs.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.705
My mom used
to grow lilacs.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.627
My dad made her
get rid of them

39:43.715 --> 39:46.047
'cause there were
too many bees.

39:46.134 --> 39:50.093
We ruled out HSP because
there was no inciting
respiratory infection.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.387
But in rare cases,
it can also be triggered
by a bee sting.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.341
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.301
Maybe we just
didn't see it.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.481
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

40:07.572 --> 40:09.608
About a month ago.

40:11.576 --> 40:12.986
What's going on?

40:13.703 --> 40:17.571
I think your wife has
Henoch-Schonlein purpura,

40:17.665 --> 40:20.748
systemic vasculitis
that can cause lesions

40:20.835 --> 40:22.450
and inflammation
throughout the body.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.160
It's pretty awful,

40:24.255 --> 40:28.669
which explains why it was
named after a German.
Actually, two Germans.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.049
Lesions can pop up
in the heart,

40:31.137 --> 40:32.843
sometimes
in the kidneys.

40:32.931 --> 40:37.425
But always on the skin.
Means you'd have
a rash somewhere.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.724
I don't.

40:38.811 --> 40:39.971
HOUSE: Not that you know of.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.519
Okay, I'm going to
have to check your holes.
I'll start with the mouth.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.568
If there's nothing there,
then things might
have to get kinky.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.020
HOUSE: Say "ah."

40:50.114 --> 40:51.194
Ah.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.113
(SIGHS)

40:53.201 --> 40:55.237
I was kind of
hoping for kinky.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.864
Is that good or bad?

40:56.955 --> 41:00.368
We'll treat her
with high-dose Mg
and cyclophosphamide.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.914
You should be fine.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.164
I'm going to be okay.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.289
I love you.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.626
That is adorable.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.133
Other than you still
wanting to have sex
with other dudes

41:16.224 --> 41:17.464
and him bankrupting
your family,

41:17.558 --> 41:20.846
I think you kids are
pretty much home free.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.557
(SCOFFS)

41:28.236 --> 41:29.567
And...

41:31.280 --> 41:32.315
You two made up?

41:32.407 --> 41:34.238
No.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.486
You can
thank me later.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.078
I'm all in.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.199
All right.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.582

I'm getting
some nervousness.

You need a hand?

42:38.139 --> 42:40.972
Sorry about canceling
the other night.

You wanna
go somewhere?
