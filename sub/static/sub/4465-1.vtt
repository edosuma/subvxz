03:25.385 --> 03:26.510
Where are they?

03:26.586 --> 03:27.610
I don't know.

03:27.687 --> 03:29.120
Dad!

03:29.189 --> 03:31.180
Uncle Merrill!

03:31.258 --> 03:33.920
Dad!

03:37.931 --> 03:39.421
Morgan!

03:51.378 --> 03:52.811
Bo? Bo?

03:52.879 --> 03:55.006
Bo, where's Morgan?

03:55.081 --> 03:56.070
Bo?

03:56.149 --> 03:58.276
Are you in my dream,
too?

03:58.351 --> 04:00.717
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!

04:00.787 --> 04:02.118
Hey...

04:02.188 --> 04:03.746
Honey...

04:07.627 --> 04:10.460
Morgan?
What's happening?

04:10.530 --> 04:13.328
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.

04:15.602 --> 04:17.365
Are you hurt?

04:17.437 --> 04:20.634
I think God did it.

04:20.707 --> 04:22.971
Did what, Morgan?

05:41.287 --> 05:44.256
Look, Lee, I don't even care
if it was him.

05:44.324 --> 05:46.884
And you can just have
a word with him,

05:46.960 --> 05:48.951
and that'd be enough for me.

05:49.029 --> 05:52.988
See, it was strange
finding the crops that way.

05:53.066 --> 05:55.432
The kids were confused by it,

05:55.502 --> 05:57.800
and, uh, it'd sure take
the strangeness away

05:57.871 --> 06:01.568
if I knew it was just Lionel and 
the Wolfington brothers messing around,

06:01.641 --> 06:02.835
that's all.

06:04.344 --> 06:06.505
At the movies?

06:06.579 --> 06:09.275
Are you sure?

06:09.349 --> 06:11.146
All right, then.

06:11.217 --> 06:13.185
Uh, thanks for
your patience, Lee.

06:13.253 --> 06:14.777
Yeah. Bye.

06:19.192 --> 06:23.390
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.

06:23.463 --> 06:26.398
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.127
He doesn't treat animals.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.226
Well, he'll know
what to do.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.111
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.

06:48.188 --> 06:50.156
I only called you folks
two hours ago.

06:50.223 --> 06:52.783
Old Mrs. Kendleman
twisted her ankle,

06:52.859 --> 06:55.350
as she puts it,
diving for her life

06:55.428 --> 06:59.728
when a bunch of school kids rode down 
the sidewalk on skateboards.

06:59.799 --> 07:02.825
She went down to Thornton's
store this morning

07:02.902 --> 07:06.201
and started spitting
on the new skateboards.

07:06.272 --> 07:07.830
Spitting!

07:07.907 --> 07:09.397
By the time I got there,

07:09.476 --> 07:12.536
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed
the whole damned place.

07:12.612 --> 07:15.274
And she must have had
a cold or something.

07:15.348 --> 07:19.011
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.

07:21.488 --> 07:24.787
So, what happened
to your crops?

07:28.294 --> 07:31.229
Dad's gonna burn these
again.

07:39.472 --> 07:41.440
It's contaminated.

07:41.507 --> 07:43.805
You don't even know
what that word means.

07:46.245 --> 07:47.974
It's not contaminated.

07:48.047 --> 07:51.073
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.515
It tastes funny.

07:52.585 --> 07:53.813
It does not.

07:53.886 --> 07:55.854
And besides, he licks
his butt every day.

07:55.922 --> 07:57.583
I don't think he'll mind.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.904
Houdini?

08:16.976 --> 08:19.501
Bo, don't run.

08:19.579 --> 08:20.876
What's wrong, boy?

08:22.515 --> 08:23.743
Stop it, Houdini.

08:29.322 --> 08:34.385
Look at where
it's bent over, Father.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.395
It's not broken.

08:37.462 --> 08:42.594
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk 
of corn over without breaking it?

08:42.668 --> 08:45.569
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.

08:45.638 --> 08:48.630
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard 
and the Wolfington brothers.

08:48.708 --> 08:50.266
They can't take a piss

08:50.343 --> 08:53.335
without wetting
the front of their pants.

08:53.412 --> 08:56.711
I don't think anyone else around here 
has had any problems.

08:56.782 --> 08:59.717
I was over at Theo Henry's
farm yesterday afternoon,

08:59.785 --> 09:01.912
and he would have
mentioned something.

09:01.988 --> 09:04.548
Why were you at Theo's place?

09:04.624 --> 09:08.082
Some animals around the county
have been acting funny...

09:08.161 --> 09:11.562
and some of them violent.

09:11.631 --> 09:13.599
What is it, a virus?

09:13.666 --> 09:16.362
I don't think so, Father.

09:16.435 --> 09:19.768
They're more edgy,
you know, and alert.

09:19.839 --> 09:23.206
It's almost like they act when they 
smell a predator around...

09:23.276 --> 09:25.710
peeing on themselves
and everything.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.954
Caroline...

09:38.024 --> 09:41.357
please stop calling me
"Father."

09:41.427 --> 09:43.691
What's wrong?

09:43.763 --> 09:46.857
I don't hear my children.

10:15.394 --> 10:17.328
He fell on me.

10:17.396 --> 10:20.160
He wanted to kill Bo.

10:36.582 --> 10:38.243
Did he hurt you?

10:38.317 --> 10:40.251
No.

10:44.924 --> 10:47.415
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

11:07.780 --> 11:10.544
Where were you?

11:10.616 --> 11:12.049
Houdini's sick.

11:12.118 --> 11:14.586
Tie Isabel up to the
back of the shed, please,

11:14.654 --> 11:17.020
and make sure
the knot's very tight.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.491
What's the matter?

12:03.569 --> 12:05.799
There's a monster
outside my room.

12:05.871 --> 12:08.738
Can I have a glass of water?

12:08.807 --> 12:12.243
What's wrong with the water
next to your bed?

12:12.311 --> 12:15.280
It tastes old.

12:47.613 --> 12:50.047
What are you thinking about?

12:52.651 --> 12:57.213
Why do you talk to Mom
when you're by yourself?

12:59.124 --> 13:01.922
Makes me feel better.

13:01.994 --> 13:05.430
Does she ever answer back?

13:09.034 --> 13:11.730
No.

13:13.572 --> 13:17.736
She never answers me either.

13:33.292 --> 13:34.759
What?

13:34.827 --> 13:39.355
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.

13:39.431 --> 13:41.296
It's time
for an ass-whupping.

13:41.367 --> 13:44.495
This is not an intelligent
way to approach this.

13:44.570 --> 13:47.130
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.

13:47.206 --> 13:49.037
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee
a favor.

13:49.108 --> 13:51.235
All right, listen...
we both go outside,

13:51.310 --> 13:53.710
move around the house
in opposite directions.

13:53.779 --> 13:55.679
We act crazy,
insane with anger...

13:55.748 --> 13:57.443
make them crap in their pants,

13:57.516 --> 14:01.145
force them around till
we meet up on the other side.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.482
Explain "act crazy."

14:02.554 --> 14:04.146
You know, curse and stuff.

14:04.223 --> 14:05.554
You want me to curse?

14:05.624 --> 14:08.058
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.

14:08.127 --> 14:09.094
What?

14:09.161 --> 14:10.719
Well, it won't be convincing.

14:10.796 --> 14:12.730
It doesn't sound natural
when I curse.

14:12.798 --> 14:15.767
Just make noises, then.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.028
Explain "noises."

14:17.102 --> 14:19.502
Are you gonna do this or what?

14:19.571 --> 14:20.799
No, I'm not.

14:20.873 --> 14:23.933
All right, you want them stealing something
in the house next time?

14:24.009 --> 14:25.772
On the count of three...

14:25.844 --> 14:27.368
- 1...
- All right.

14:27.446 --> 14:28.845
2... 3!

14:31.383 --> 14:33.874
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!

14:33.952 --> 14:36.216
We're gonna beat
your ass, bitch!

14:41.026 --> 14:43.620
We're gonna tear
your head off!

14:43.696 --> 14:45.561
I'm losing my mind!

14:47.966 --> 14:49.593
It's time for
an ass-whupping!

14:55.407 --> 14:56.738
I cursed.

14:56.809 --> 14:59.004
I heard.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.774
How did he get...

15:19.631 --> 15:22.293
Are you sure
this is Lionel Prichard?

15:40.052 --> 15:42.384
You like that?

15:45.758 --> 15:48.591
You got an old
baby monitor around?

15:48.660 --> 15:50.560
Bo had an old baby monitor.

15:50.629 --> 15:53.530
You can use Bo's baby monitor
as a walkie-talkie.

15:53.599 --> 15:55.396
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.129
It only works one way,
but that'll do fine.

16:00.105 --> 16:04.098
That is, until someone gets you an old 
walkie-talkie left over at the station.

16:04.176 --> 16:06.007
Stop! It's hideous!

16:06.078 --> 16:07.375
Get it off!

16:07.446 --> 16:08.606
I-I know what to do.

16:10.015 --> 16:11.482
Hey, Bo...

16:11.550 --> 16:13.848
turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.

16:13.919 --> 16:15.079
Doy-da!

16:17.890 --> 16:19.755
You're too old
to still be doing this.

16:19.825 --> 16:21.986
You take a glass of water,
and you finish it.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.051
Now, what's wrong
with this one?

16:24.129 --> 16:26.188
It has dust in it.

16:26.265 --> 16:27.698
This one?

16:27.766 --> 16:29.290
A hair.

16:29.368 --> 16:30.801
This one?

16:30.869 --> 16:34.236
Morgan took a sip, and
it has his amebas in it.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.672
My turn.

16:38.911 --> 16:42.540
So, how are you, Merrill?

16:42.614 --> 16:45.082
Fine.

16:45.150 --> 16:48.449
How is work at
the gas station?

16:48.520 --> 16:50.385
Stimulating.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.894
I never got a chance
to tell you,

16:56.962 --> 17:00.557
but I-I thought your moving in here 
with your brother after...

17:00.632 --> 17:03.157
it was a nice thing to do.

17:03.235 --> 17:06.363
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.

17:10.509 --> 17:11.976
You are.

17:30.162 --> 17:32.562
Sorry.

17:32.631 --> 17:36.829
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark."

17:36.902 --> 17:39.496
Yes, it was.

17:39.571 --> 17:43.598
You can't describe him
at all?

17:43.675 --> 17:46.109
Don't you think
that's kind of odd?

17:46.178 --> 17:48.942
A little.

17:49.014 --> 17:53.246
I don't know whether to look
for a giant or a midget.

17:53.318 --> 17:55.343
No, he definitely
wasn't a midget.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.217
Okay.

17:57.289 --> 17:59.655
So he was tall?

18:01.994 --> 18:04.588
I-I would say so, yes.

18:04.663 --> 18:06.290
Probably.

18:06.365 --> 18:08.595
Over 6 feet?

18:10.736 --> 18:12.260
It was very dark.

18:12.337 --> 18:14.100
Yes, it was.

18:14.172 --> 18:17.369
How certain are you
that this was a male?

18:17.442 --> 18:20.275
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.

18:20.345 --> 18:21.710
I don't know, Merrill.

18:21.780 --> 18:24.510
I've seen some of those women
on the Olympics.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.608
They can run like the wind.

18:26.685 --> 18:29.245
This guy got on our roof
in, like, a second.

18:29.321 --> 18:31.619
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.

18:31.690 --> 18:34.523
They have women's high jumping
in the Olympics.

18:34.593 --> 18:36.686
They got these
Scandinavian women

18:36.762 --> 18:39.060
who can jump clean over me.

18:42.901 --> 18:45.369
Caroline, I know you're
making a point here,

18:45.437 --> 18:47.405
but I just don't know
what it is.

18:47.472 --> 18:50.669
An out-of-town woman stopped by
the diner yesterday afternoon

18:50.742 --> 18:52.505
and started yelling
and cussing

18:52.578 --> 18:55.172
because they didn't have
her favorite cigarettes

18:55.247 --> 18:57.511
at the vending machine.

18:57.583 --> 19:01.952
She scared a couple
of the customers.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.547
No one's seen her since.

19:05.624 --> 19:06.784
And my point is,

19:06.858 --> 19:10.191
we don't know anything
about the person you saw,

19:10.262 --> 19:14.164
and we should just keep
all possibilities available.

19:16.468 --> 19:18.197
Dad, where's the remote?

19:18.270 --> 19:19.703
I don't know, baby.

19:19.771 --> 19:22.831
Why don't you check
in the sofa cushions?

19:22.908 --> 19:24.466
Excluding the possibility

19:24.543 --> 19:26.909
that a female Scandinavian
Olympian

19:26.979 --> 19:30.005
was running around outside
our house last night,

19:30.082 --> 19:32.346
what else might be
a possibility?

19:32.417 --> 19:34.578
I'm not done asking
questions,

19:34.653 --> 19:37.178
and I don't appreciate
sarcasm.

19:39.257 --> 19:40.690
Do you two have anyone

19:40.759 --> 19:43.887
who might have a grudge
or something against you...

19:43.962 --> 19:45.953
maybe a-a church member

19:46.031 --> 19:48.124
who... who might
not have liked

19:48.200 --> 19:50.634
the fact that
you left the church?

19:53.305 --> 19:55.205
I don't think so.

19:55.273 --> 19:56.501
Okay, I was out of line

19:56.575 --> 19:59.237
with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.

19:59.311 --> 20:02.644
It's just,
I'm pretty strong,

20:02.714 --> 20:05.012
and I'm pretty fast.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.608
And I was running
as fast as I could,

20:07.686 --> 20:12.885
and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.

20:12.958 --> 20:15.324
There's only food
under the sofa.

20:15.394 --> 20:16.725
Baby, why don't you

20:16.795 --> 20:19.355
just change the channel
on the television?

20:19.431 --> 20:20.796
I did.

20:20.866 --> 20:21.992
And?

20:22.067 --> 20:26.003
Same show's on every station.

20:26.071 --> 20:29.837
Every station?

20:32.543 --> 20:38.573
Bo, turn up the volume.

20:38.649 --> 20:41.083
Crop signs first emerged
in the late '70s

20:41.152 --> 20:43.916
with renewed interest
in extraterrestrial life.

20:43.988 --> 20:46.752
They died out
by the early '80s,

20:46.824 --> 20:48.724
dismissed as hoaxes.

20:48.793 --> 20:52.593
This new resurgence
is wholly different.

20:52.663 --> 20:55.291
The speed and the quantity
in which it has appeared

20:55.366 --> 20:58.494
implies the coordination
of hundreds of individuals

20:58.569 --> 21:00.332
over many countries.

21:03.708 --> 21:07.439
There are only a limited
number of explanations.

21:07.511 --> 21:12.107
Either this is one of the most 
elaborate hoaxes ever created,

21:12.183 --> 21:15.550
or basically...

21:15.619 --> 21:18.315
it's for real.

21:23.928 --> 21:27.364
Extraterrestrials.

21:27.431 --> 21:32.198
What in God's name
is going on?

21:32.269 --> 21:35.761
I did some research
after I saw your crops.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.936
Two or three guys can make a design the size 
of the one in your field overnight

21:40.011 --> 21:41.911
using just boards and ropes.

21:41.979 --> 21:43.241
Really?

21:43.314 --> 21:47.011
That's how these things
have been done in the past.

21:47.084 --> 21:49.917
But there are so many now.

21:49.987 --> 21:53.787
How could so many people
be in on it?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.186
I can't think straight.

21:57.261 --> 21:59.229
I'm... I'm gonna go back
to the station

21:59.296 --> 22:02.424
and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.831
And after that, I'll...

22:03.901 --> 22:06.335
I might make some calls.

22:06.404 --> 22:09.840
But I'll tell you something... 
what I said in there, it still goes.

22:09.907 --> 22:12.398
Your... your family
has been through a lot.

22:12.476 --> 22:15.070
And the last thing
these children need to do

22:15.146 --> 22:18.741
is worry about some crazy
things happening in the world.

22:18.816 --> 22:20.408
Now, take them into town

22:20.484 --> 22:24.443
and get their minds and your mind on
everyday things, hmm?

22:24.522 --> 22:26.251
Good medicine.

22:26.323 --> 22:29.383
That's good advice.

22:31.929 --> 22:35.194
And you take care
of yourself...

22:35.266 --> 22:38.064
Graham.

22:47.178 --> 22:50.579
The footage you're watching
was shot yesterday afternoon

22:50.648 --> 22:53.208
by a 34-year-old local
cameraman in Bangalore,

22:53.284 --> 22:55.514
a southern city of India.

22:55.586 --> 22:58.111
It's the 18th reported
crop sign

22:58.189 --> 23:01.420
found in that country
in the last 72 hours.

23:03.727 --> 23:06.457
Uncle Merrill, will you
turn on the radio?

23:08.399 --> 23:11.857
They are signs intended
to be seen from the sky...

23:13.637 --> 23:18.097
No radio either.
Just for a while.

23:45.202 --> 23:47.534
Book money?

23:47.605 --> 23:49.266
Sure.

23:51.208 --> 23:54.109
Just one.

24:02.286 --> 24:05.312
Be back for pizza in 15.

24:08.459 --> 24:12.225
It's just a bunch of crock.

24:12.296 --> 24:16.027
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.295
Been watching these reports
since morning.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.929
I have seen 12 soda
commercials so far...

24:21.005 --> 24:22.666
12!

24:22.740 --> 24:26.005
You have any books
on extraterrestrials?

24:26.076 --> 24:28.704
Now, don't tell me you believe
this horse manure.

24:28.779 --> 24:31.009
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.

24:31.081 --> 24:32.912
Came by mistake
in a shipment...

24:32.983 --> 24:35.144
decided to keep it
for the city people.

24:35.219 --> 24:39.246
Last row, third book
on the left, honey.

24:39.323 --> 24:41.723
Why is no one saying
the obvious?

24:41.792 --> 24:44.022
These are just copycats.

24:44.094 --> 24:47.063
Someone somewhere does
the first one...

24:47.131 --> 24:50.225
It was asthma medicine,
right, Father?

24:50.301 --> 24:51.893
For Morgan Hess.

24:51.969 --> 24:54.335
And it's not "Father"
anymore.

24:54.405 --> 24:57.772
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people
get the same brilliant idea,

24:57.841 --> 25:03.336
and here we are, on
the verge of mass hysteria.

25:07.685 --> 25:10.245
Can I ask you a favor,
Father?

25:10.321 --> 25:12.812
I need to clear
my conscience.

25:12.890 --> 25:15.051
Will you listen to me?

25:15.125 --> 25:19.926
Tracey... I am not
a reverend anymore.

25:19.997 --> 25:22.727
I haven't been
for six months.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.927
You know this.

25:25.002 --> 25:27.470
All this stuff on TV...

25:27.538 --> 25:30.439
two girls came in here talking about 
the end of the world...

25:30.507 --> 25:33.738
I'm just a little scared.

25:33.811 --> 25:38.111
Please, I need to clear
my conscience.

25:44.955 --> 25:47.651
I've got it figured.

25:50.994 --> 25:52.018
You do?

25:52.096 --> 25:53.893
I've had two separate
folks tell me

25:53.964 --> 25:57.195
there have been strangers around these parts
last couple nights.

25:57.267 --> 25:59.497
Can't tell what they look like

25:59.570 --> 26:03.097
'cause they're staying
in the shadows... covert like.

26:03.173 --> 26:05.164
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.

26:05.242 --> 26:07.335
And that's the giveaway.

26:07.411 --> 26:08.878
I see.

26:08.946 --> 26:10.777
It's called "probing."

26:10.848 --> 26:12.941
It's a military procedure.

26:13.016 --> 26:14.916
You send out a
reconnaissance group...

26:14.985 --> 26:17.351
very small...
to check things out.

26:17.421 --> 26:21.619
Not to engage but
to evaluate the situation...

26:21.692 --> 26:24.559
evaluate the level of danger,

26:24.628 --> 26:27.688
make sure things
are all clear.

26:27.765 --> 26:30.893
Clear for what?

26:30.968 --> 26:33.869
For the rest of them.

26:37.374 --> 26:39.103
Yeah?

26:39.176 --> 26:42.145
You got a pamphlet or
something I can read?

26:42.212 --> 26:45.113
Sure.

26:45.182 --> 26:47.343
Thanks.

26:47.417 --> 26:51.786
You didn't used to play
baseball, did ya?

26:51.855 --> 26:54.483
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.

26:54.558 --> 26:57.527
I was there the day
you hit that 507-footer

26:57.594 --> 27:00.461
over the left-field wall...
set the record.

27:00.531 --> 27:03.056
Man, that thing had
a motor on it.

27:03.133 --> 27:05.328
It's still the record, right?

27:05.402 --> 27:09.805
Got the bat at home
o-on the wall.

27:09.873 --> 27:12.740
You've got two minor-league
home-run records, don't ya?

27:12.810 --> 27:15.210
Five.

27:15.312 --> 27:17.678
Why weren't you in the pros
making stacks of cash

27:17.748 --> 27:20.080
and getting your toes licked
by beautiful women?

27:20.150 --> 27:23.779
'Cause he has another record 
most people don't know about.

27:23.854 --> 27:26.516
He has the minor-league
strikeout record.

27:28.926 --> 27:30.826
Hello, Lionel.

27:30.894 --> 27:33.385
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.

27:33.463 --> 27:36.455
He would just swing that bat as hard as
he could every time.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.330
Didn't matter what
the coaches said,

27:38.402 --> 27:39.801
didn't matter who was on base.

27:39.870 --> 27:43.033
He would just whip that bat through the air
as hard as he could.

27:43.106 --> 27:46.405
Looked like a lumberjack
chopping down a tree.

27:46.476 --> 27:50.503
Merrill here has more strikeouts 
than any two players.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.345
You really got
the strikeout record?

28:00.257 --> 28:04.023
Felt wrong not to swing.

28:15.539 --> 28:17.473
It's contaminated.

28:17.541 --> 28:20.442
Carl, there's something wrong
with our water.

28:20.510 --> 28:23.070
Your water's fine.

28:23.146 --> 28:25.808
Bo has this thing
about her drinking water.

28:25.883 --> 28:27.441
She had it her whole life.

28:27.517 --> 28:31.214
It's like a tick people have, 
except it's not a tick.

28:31.288 --> 28:34.257
Is that right?

28:34.324 --> 28:36.258
13!

28:36.326 --> 28:38.419
## Don't give me
that so-so-soda ##

28:38.495 --> 28:39.757
## That same old cola ##

28:39.830 --> 28:41.320
## I wanna pop ##

28:41.398 --> 28:44.094
- ## Pop, pop I wanna... Shasta ##
- I'll take it.

28:44.167 --> 28:47.330
I cursed 37 times last week.

28:47.404 --> 28:52.398
I said the "F" word a couple times, 
but mostly..."shits"

28:52.476 --> 28:57.345
and..."bastards."

28:57.414 --> 28:59.848
Is "douche bag" a curse?

28:59.917 --> 29:03.250
I suppose that would
depend on its usage.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.118
How about, "John, you're a douche bag
for kissing Barbara"?

29:06.189 --> 29:09.090
It's a curse.

29:09.159 --> 29:14.096
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.

29:17.755 --> 29:18.949
Pharmacy crowded?

29:19.023 --> 29:20.650
I don't want any one of you

29:20.724 --> 29:23.056
spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.

29:23.127 --> 29:24.890
Is that understood?

29:44.181 --> 29:46.376
Is that him?

29:51.088 --> 29:53.352
Yeah.

30:14.612 --> 30:17.513
Who is he?

30:49.513 --> 30:52.038
What is it?

30:52.115 --> 30:54.913
It's Bo's baby monitor.

30:54.985 --> 30:56.680
I found it in the basement.

30:56.753 --> 30:59.244
I'm gonna use it
as a walkie-talkie.

31:04.828 --> 31:07.888
What if it's catching
a signal from them?

31:10.801 --> 31:12.234
It's not.

31:12.302 --> 31:13.667
But it wasn't working.

31:13.737 --> 31:16.103
Morgan, this crop stuff
is about a bunch of nerds

31:16.173 --> 31:18.232
who never had a girlfriend
in their lives.

31:18.308 --> 31:20.799
They're, like, 30, and they work up 
little codes together,

31:20.877 --> 31:23.937
and they analyze Greek mythology and 
make up secret societies

31:24.014 --> 31:27.074
where other guys who never had 
girlfriends before can join in.

31:27.150 --> 31:29.550
They do stupid crap
like this to feel special.

31:29.619 --> 31:30.779
It's a scam.

31:30.854 --> 31:32.583
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago,

31:32.656 --> 31:34.851
and new nerds
are doing it again.

31:38.328 --> 31:41.729
It's just static, Morgan,
all right.

31:41.798 --> 31:43.322
Turn it up. See.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.703
It's a code.

31:48.772 --> 31:51.172
Why can't they get
girlfriends?

31:51.241 --> 31:53.334
Can I see that, please?

32:00.917 --> 32:03.784
It's noise.

32:03.854 --> 32:06.687
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.

32:06.756 --> 32:08.246
Maybe some new batteries...

32:08.325 --> 32:10.486
We might lose the signal.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.960
This is exactly
what the nerds want.

32:15.131 --> 32:17.031
I'm getting out now.

32:23.773 --> 32:25.468
Nobody move.

32:28.111 --> 32:31.137
Voices.
Did you hear that?

32:31.214 --> 32:32.806
Not English, though.

32:32.883 --> 32:35.215
You heard the voices,
right, Uncle Merrill?

32:37.954 --> 32:40.582
I heard them, Morgan.

32:45.495 --> 32:48.828
Probably picking up
another baby monitor.

32:48.899 --> 32:51.060
That's right.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.040
Let me see it.

33:00.911 --> 33:02.776
Stop!

33:11.354 --> 33:15.586
See, this is why
we're not watching TV.

33:15.659 --> 33:17.820
People get obsessed.

33:17.894 --> 33:19.054
I'm letting go now.

33:19.129 --> 33:20.061
No, Dad!

33:20.130 --> 33:21.222
Don't do it!

33:21.298 --> 33:22.925
You'll lose the signal.

33:24.968 --> 33:26.731
Don't let go.

33:28.338 --> 33:31.307
It gets clearer
the higher you hold it.

33:35.111 --> 33:37.375
I got it.

33:38.748 --> 33:42.184
Bo, honey, I don't want
you climbing on the car.

33:42.252 --> 33:43.412
Come here.

33:56.967 --> 33:58.457
Stop!

34:00.236 --> 34:02.500
There's two of them talking.

35:12.275 --> 35:15.301
Isabel, you're gonna
feel very silly

35:15.378 --> 35:19.246
when this turns out to be
all just make-believe.

36:55.944 --> 37:00.938
You're wasting your time here!

37:01.016 --> 37:04.611
I'm not gonna report this or
anything you do to my crops

37:04.687 --> 37:07.315
to the news or TV or anybody!

37:09.358 --> 37:12.725
You're not going to get famous!

39:22.524 --> 39:25.186
Okay.

39:25.260 --> 39:27.751
Let's turn on the TV.

39:31.499 --> 39:35.765
It first appeared
52 minutes ago.

39:35.837 --> 39:39.534
Mexico City officials
as well as U. S. Officials

39:39.607 --> 39:41.837
have confirmed
that these are not aircraft

39:41.909 --> 39:43.672
from either government's
air force.

39:43.744 --> 39:47.475
The first sighting was made
by an Air Mexico 747

39:47.548 --> 39:50.381
en route from Mazatlán
to New York

39:50.451 --> 39:54.683
as the unidentified crafts
entered Mexico City air space.

39:54.755 --> 39:58.851
They were not detected by
radar by either country.

39:58.926 --> 40:00.860
The nerds were right.

40:00.928 --> 40:03.021
We have to tape this.

40:06.901 --> 40:08.926
My ballet recital.

40:09.003 --> 40:11.301
Listen, Bo, this
is very important.

40:11.372 --> 40:15.900
Everything people have written about 
in science books is going to change.

40:15.977 --> 40:19.344
The history of the world's
future is on the TV right now.

40:19.413 --> 40:22.507
We need to record this so you can 
show your children this tape

40:22.583 --> 40:24.744
and say you were there.

40:24.819 --> 40:26.514
For your children, Bo.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.020
My ballet recital.

40:28.089 --> 40:29.021
Dad!

40:29.090 --> 40:30.751
Find another tape.

40:34.795 --> 40:37.559
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.

40:41.402 --> 40:43.927
You are seeing a live feed

40:44.005 --> 40:46.974
from our affiliate
down here in Mexico City.

40:47.041 --> 40:51.671
This image has not been adjusted or 
enhanced in any way.

40:51.746 --> 40:53.839
What you're seeing is real.

40:53.915 --> 40:55.405
It's unbelievable.

40:55.483 --> 40:58.008
Everything they wrote
in science books

40:58.085 --> 40:59.177
is about to change.

40:59.253 --> 41:00.743
I told you.

41:16.771 --> 41:19.035
Some people
are probably thinking

41:19.106 --> 41:20.937
this is the end of the world.

41:21.008 --> 41:23.602
That's true.

41:23.678 --> 41:26.442
Do you think it could be?

41:26.514 --> 41:29.108
Yes.

41:29.183 --> 41:31.242
How can you say that?

41:33.421 --> 41:36.049
That wasn't
the answer you wanted?

41:38.826 --> 41:42.057
Couldn't you pretend to be
like you used to be?

41:42.129 --> 41:44.893
Give me some comfort.

41:48.202 --> 41:53.037
People break down
into two groups

41:53.107 --> 41:56.042
when they experience
something lucky.

41:56.110 --> 41:59.910
Group number one sees
it as more than luck,

41:59.981 --> 42:01.881
more than coincidence.

42:01.949 --> 42:04.782
They see it as a sign...

42:04.852 --> 42:07.878
evidence that there
is someone up there

42:07.955 --> 42:10.549
watching out for them.

42:10.625 --> 42:14.755
Group number two sees
it as just pure luck,

42:14.829 --> 42:17.320
a happy turn of chance.

42:17.398 --> 42:19.696
I'm sure the people
in group number two

42:19.767 --> 42:23.100
are looking at those 14 lights in 
a very suspicious way.

42:23.170 --> 42:27.334
For them, the situation
isn't 50-50.

42:27.408 --> 42:31.640
Could be bad, could be good.

42:31.712 --> 42:34.146
But deep down,

42:34.215 --> 42:37.150
they feel that
whatever happens,

42:37.218 --> 42:39.652
they're on their own.

42:39.720 --> 42:44.487
And that fills them with fear.

42:44.558 --> 42:49.086
Yeah, there are those people.

42:49.163 --> 42:53.691
But there's a whole lot of people in
the group number one.

42:53.768 --> 42:56.896
When they see those 14 lights,

42:56.971 --> 43:00.498
they're looking at a miracle.

43:00.574 --> 43:05.409
And deep down, they feel that
whatever's going to happen,

43:05.479 --> 43:09.575
there'll be someone
there to help them.

43:09.650 --> 43:13.051
And that fills them with hope.

43:13.120 --> 43:17.580
See, what you have to ask yourself is, 
what kind of person are you?

43:17.658 --> 43:22.755
Are you the kind who
sees signs, sees miracles?

43:22.830 --> 43:26.288
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

43:26.367 --> 43:30.326
Or look at the question
this way...

43:30.404 --> 43:35.239
is it possible that there
are no coincidences?

43:42.450 --> 43:45.385
I was at this party once.

43:45.453 --> 43:48.650
I'm on the couch
with Randa McKinney.

43:48.723 --> 43:50.987
She was just sitting there

43:51.058 --> 43:54.721
looking beautiful,
staring at me.

43:54.795 --> 43:57.821
I go to lean in
and kiss her...

43:57.898 --> 44:02.062
and I realize
I have gum in my mouth.

44:02.136 --> 44:05.765
So I turn, take out the gum,

44:05.840 --> 44:08.900
stuff it in a paper cup
next to the sofa,

44:08.976 --> 44:10.534
and turn around.

44:10.611 --> 44:14.513
Randa McKinney throws up
all over herself.

44:16.650 --> 44:21.349
I knew the second it happened
it was a miracle.

44:21.422 --> 44:25.358
I could have been kissing
her when she threw up.

44:25.426 --> 44:28.520
That would have
scarred me for life.

44:28.596 --> 44:32.054
I may never have recovered.

44:34.135 --> 44:37.263
I'm a miracle man.

44:37.338 --> 44:39.806
Those lights are a miracle.

44:41.041 --> 44:43.908
There you go.

44:43.978 --> 44:46.811
So, which type are you?

44:48.482 --> 44:50.677
Do you feel comforted?

44:53.254 --> 44:56.280
Yeah, I do.

44:56.357 --> 44:59.121
Then what does it matter?

45:06.333 --> 45:08.301
I never told you
the last words

45:08.369 --> 45:12.169
that Colleen said
before they let her die.

45:15.075 --> 45:18.101
She said, "See."

45:19.980 --> 45:24.076
Then her eyes glazed a bit.

45:24.151 --> 45:27.518
And then she said,
"Swing away."

45:29.256 --> 45:31.417
You know why she said that?

45:33.861 --> 45:37.422
Because the nerve endings in her brain
were firing as she died,

45:37.498 --> 45:42.629
and some random memory of us at one of your 
baseball games just popped into her head.

45:49.143 --> 45:52.340
There is no one watching
out for us, Merrill.

45:54.081 --> 45:56.481
We are all on our own.

46:35.856 --> 46:37.756
What do you know?

46:37.825 --> 46:40.225
Well, there was an accident... 
drunk driving, they weren't sure...

46:40.294 --> 46:42.228
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

46:42.296 --> 46:44.821
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

46:44.899 --> 46:48.027
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.

46:48.102 --> 46:50.400
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?

46:50.471 --> 46:52.939
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.

47:38.919 --> 47:40.216
For the kids' protection.

47:40.287 --> 47:42.585
All they were doing was
watching TV from 5:00 a.m.

47:42.656 --> 47:45.022
I felt like they were getting obsessed,
like you said.

47:45.092 --> 47:48.027
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or
tea party or something.

47:48.095 --> 47:49.528
What's furry, furry rabbit?

47:49.597 --> 47:50.859
It's a game, isn't it?

47:50.931 --> 47:52.990
Anyways, they closed
the schools.

47:53.067 --> 47:55.501
And there's been some
interesting developments.

47:55.569 --> 47:56.627
What time is it?

47:56.704 --> 47:58.001
11:00 a.m.

47:58.072 --> 48:01.769
They're gone, but they're
not really gone.

48:01.842 --> 48:03.070
We just can't see them.

48:03.143 --> 48:05.338
Early this morning,
a bird flew into the area

48:05.412 --> 48:07.880
where the lights were
hovering last night.

48:07.948 --> 48:10.576
It stopped dead in the air
and fell straight down.

48:10.651 --> 48:12.710
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.

48:12.786 --> 48:16.153
The footage looks like the bird flew into
a wall in the sky.

48:16.223 --> 48:18.123
They found the bird. His...
his head was crushed in.

48:18.192 --> 48:22.288
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield 
thing going, l-like an optical illusion.

48:22.363 --> 48:27.630
They're still there,
hovering.

48:27.701 --> 48:30.431
Some people think there's
more of them now...

48:30.504 --> 48:33.632
All over the place,
over us, even.

48:33.707 --> 48:36.642
There's a theory about
the c... the crop circles.

48:36.710 --> 48:40.111
They could be some kind of...

48:40.180 --> 48:42.478
some kind of landmark,

48:42.549 --> 48:46.508
visual mapping system
so they could navigate,

48:46.587 --> 48:49.112
coordinate...

48:49.189 --> 48:51.521
makes sense.

49:04.668 --> 49:06.761
Want to hear a story?

49:13.777 --> 49:17.873
Is it true?

49:20.550 --> 49:23.348
So the aliens can't
read our minds.

49:24.588 --> 49:26.146
Oh.

49:26.223 --> 49:28.054
Oh, of course.

49:34.397 --> 49:36.524
They tell you everything
in this book.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.398
It says they're probably
very small, like my height,

49:39.469 --> 49:41.130
because as their
brains develop,

49:41.204 --> 49:43.536
there was no use
for physical development.

49:43.607 --> 49:45.871
It also says they're
probably vegetarians

49:45.942 --> 49:48.843
because they would have realized the
benefits of such a diet.

49:48.912 --> 49:50.345
Who wrote this book?

49:50.413 --> 49:53.211
Scientists who have been
persecuted for their beliefs.

49:53.283 --> 49:54.841
That means they're unemployed.

49:54.918 --> 49:57.182
If you're gonna make fun
of it, then forget it.

49:57.254 --> 49:59.518
This is serious.

50:03.527 --> 50:06.963
I don't know what got into me.

50:07.030 --> 50:08.224
There are pictures.

50:08.298 --> 50:11.131
Dr. Bimbu, one of the
authors of the book...

50:11.201 --> 50:12.259
- Bimbu?
- Dad.

50:12.335 --> 50:13.700
I just asked his name.

50:13.770 --> 50:15.362
You had a tone.

50:16.973 --> 50:20.932
He said there are two reasons why 
extraterrestrials would visit us...

50:21.011 --> 50:23.536
to make contact in
the spirit of exploration

50:23.613 --> 50:26.207
and furthering the
knowledge of the universe,

50:26.283 --> 50:28.581
or the other reason...
they're hostile.

50:28.652 --> 50:31.485
They've used up all the
resources on their planet,

50:31.555 --> 50:34.319
and they're looking to
harvest our planet next.

50:36.493 --> 50:38.120
Here.

51:07.457 --> 51:10.517
Looks a little like
our house, doesn't it?

51:10.594 --> 51:12.960
Same windows.

51:13.029 --> 51:14.656
That's weird.

51:31.281 --> 51:32.805
Yeah, oh, yeah.

51:32.883 --> 51:35.374
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.

51:35.452 --> 51:38.216
Everybody in this house
needs to calm down

51:38.288 --> 51:40.518
and eat some fruit
or something.

51:44.160 --> 51:45.889
Hello?

51:45.962 --> 51:48.328
Father?

51:48.398 --> 51:50.593
Hello?

51:50.667 --> 51:52.532
Hello?!

52:13.023 --> 52:14.854
I'm going out
for a few minutes.

52:14.925 --> 52:16.893
No one leaves this house...
no one.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.325
Where you going?

52:18.395 --> 52:21.193
Ray Reddy's house.

52:21.264 --> 52:22.196
Why?

52:22.265 --> 52:24.096
I think he just called here.

52:31.942 --> 52:35.275
You don't think
something bad will happen,

52:35.345 --> 52:37.245
do you, Morgan?

52:37.314 --> 52:41.114
Why? You have one of
your feelings again?

52:43.920 --> 52:45.649
Is it bad?

52:47.924 --> 52:51.416
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

52:51.494 --> 52:54.759
I don't want you to die.

52:54.831 --> 52:57.664
Who said I was gonna die?

53:00.236 --> 53:02.397
Who said I was gonna die?

54:24.448 --> 54:26.382
Hello, Ray.

54:42.366 --> 54:44.926
What happened?

54:45.002 --> 54:48.631
I wrote your number
down to call you.

54:51.608 --> 54:54.839
It's been sitting next to
the phone for 6 months.

54:58.482 --> 55:00.780
When I knew it was
inside the house...

55:00.851 --> 55:06.346
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.

55:06.423 --> 55:08.618
Thank you for coming,
Father.

55:08.692 --> 55:11.286
You're welcome, Ray.

55:11.362 --> 55:15.230
I worked so long that night.

55:15.299 --> 55:18.291
I've never fallen asleep
driving before...

55:18.369 --> 55:19.734
never since.

55:19.803 --> 55:20.963
Don't.

55:21.038 --> 55:23.029
Most of the ride home,

55:23.107 --> 55:27.043
there wasn't a car in sight
in either direction.

55:27.111 --> 55:29.875
If I'd have
fallen asleep then,

55:29.947 --> 55:33.883
I would have ended up in
a ditch with a headache.

55:33.951 --> 55:37.546
And it had to be at that
right moment...

55:37.621 --> 55:42.490
that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.

55:42.559 --> 55:46.154
It was like
it was meant to be.

55:54.638 --> 55:56.936
I guess if this is
the end of the world,

55:57.007 --> 55:59.771
I'm screwed, right?

55:59.843 --> 56:02.141
People who kill
reverends' wives

56:02.212 --> 56:07.240
aren't exactly ushered to the 
front of the line in Heaven.

56:09.820 --> 56:12.015
Wh... Where
are you going, Ray?

56:13.791 --> 56:15.258
To the lake.

56:17.161 --> 56:20.028
The way I see it...

56:20.097 --> 56:22.531
these places marked
in crops and such...

56:22.599 --> 56:25.727
none of them are
really near water.

56:25.803 --> 56:29.796
I don't think they like water.

56:29.907 --> 56:32.876
Can't be any worse than here.

56:32.943 --> 56:36.743
Did you see something, Ray?

56:38.482 --> 56:40.245
I know what I've done to you.

56:40.317 --> 56:42.444
I made you question
your faith.

56:45.155 --> 56:49.319
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.

56:59.002 --> 57:00.765
All right.

57:03.307 --> 57:05.332
And don't open
my pantry, Father.

57:05.409 --> 57:07.900
I found one of them in
there and locked him in.

57:17.549 --> 57:19.483
The startling footage
we're about to show you

57:19.551 --> 57:22.418
was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.

57:22.488 --> 57:24.786
This video was taken
yesterday afternoon

57:24.857 --> 57:26.222
at his son's 7th birthday

57:26.291 --> 57:28.350
in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.

57:28.427 --> 57:30.793
It was sent to the local
news bureau there

57:30.863 --> 57:33.730
and sent to us via satellite
just a few minutes ago.

57:33.799 --> 57:37.030
All initial opinions are
this is genuine.

57:37.102 --> 57:40.333
What you're about to see
may disturb you.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.594
Move, children!
Vámanos!

58:22.848 --> 58:24.145
Oh!

59:23.374 --> 59:24.864
Hello?

59:33.084 --> 59:36.349
The police are here.
I am with them.

59:36.421 --> 59:38.389
I am a police officer.

59:40.391 --> 59:43.952
I just want to
talk with you.

59:44.028 --> 59:46.053
We know all about the hoax.

59:48.266 --> 59:52.100
We already took some of your friends 
downtown in a paddy wagon.

59:57.175 --> 01:00:00.338
Just tell us your name
and why you did it,

01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:04.211
and we'll give you the same
deal we gave the others.

01:00:04.282 --> 01:00:06.876
Don't throw your
life away, son.

01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:38.675
Oh! Ah!

01:01:38.743 --> 01:01:40.540
Oh!

01:02:20.351 --> 01:02:22.478
Their skin changes colors.

01:02:22.553 --> 01:02:25.181
That's why we couldn't
see them that night.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:28.887
Tell me something, Morgan.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.259
Uh... in this
book of yours...

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.321
did they happen to detail

01:02:34.399 --> 01:02:37.596
what would happen
if they were hostile?

01:02:37.669 --> 01:02:39.660
Yes.

01:02:39.737 --> 01:02:42.035
It said they would
probably invade.

01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:46.702
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.

01:02:46.778 --> 01:02:49.906
They wouldn't use our technology or 
fight an airborne battle

01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:52.677
'cause they know eventually
we would use nuclear weapons.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.378
Then the planet would
be useless to them.

01:02:55.453 --> 01:02:59.685
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.

01:02:59.757 --> 01:03:01.122
What else did it say?

01:03:01.192 --> 01:03:04.559
They said there are one of
two outcomes of an invasion.

01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:08.065
One, they fight and are defeated and
have to return again

01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:11.898
with full forces hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of years later.

01:03:11.969 --> 01:03:15.336
What's two?

01:03:15.406 --> 01:03:18.807
They win.

01:03:18.876 --> 01:03:22.812
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.849
Is this really happening?

01:03:30.021 --> 01:03:32.182
I heard a theory that, uh,

01:03:32.256 --> 01:03:35.282
they don't like
places near water.

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.988
Maybe we'd be safe from them
near a lake or something.

01:03:39.063 --> 01:03:41.497
Sounds made-up.

01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:53.701
I saw one of them
at Ray Reddy's house.

01:03:53.778 --> 01:03:55.769
I can't be sure,

01:03:55.847 --> 01:03:58.839
but I got the distinct feeling
he wanted to harm me.

01:04:00.985 --> 01:04:02.919
So...

01:04:02.987 --> 01:04:07.924
we can choose to believe this
lake idea, pack up, and go,

01:04:07.992 --> 01:04:12.759
or we can stay here, hide
inside our home, wait it out.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:17.995
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.

01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:23.336
Either way, at least
we'll be together.

01:04:23.407 --> 01:04:26.399
All those in favor of
the lake idea, raise your hand.

01:04:28.913 --> 01:04:32.280
Yeah.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.342
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:41.624
Okay.

01:04:41.692 --> 01:04:43.523
My vote counts as two.

01:04:43.594 --> 01:04:45.221
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!

01:04:45.296 --> 01:04:46.661
Morgan, calm down.

01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:48.926
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.093
We don't know anything yet.

01:04:51.169 --> 01:04:54.263
We'll be safe here anyway.

01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:56.272
I don't want to leave home.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.036
This is where
we lived with Mom.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.772
That's got nothing
to do with this.

01:05:01.846 --> 01:05:04.246
I change my vote.

01:05:04.315 --> 01:05:05.509
You can't change your vote.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:09.110
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

01:05:09.187 --> 01:05:11.451
This is ridiculous.

01:05:11.522 --> 01:05:13.990
You lose, 3-2.

01:05:30.007 --> 01:05:34.273
We're going to board up
every window in this house.

01:05:34.345 --> 01:05:38.008
How do we know boards
will do anything?

01:05:38.082 --> 01:05:43.179
Because they seem to have
trouble with pantry doors.

01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:48.714
The information we're receiving

01:06:48.785 --> 01:06:50.980
comes from our affiliates
across the world.

01:06:51.054 --> 01:06:54.387
Dad, Uncle Merrill!

01:06:57.294 --> 01:07:00.957
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem

01:07:01.031 --> 01:07:04.330
as the latest to confirm
the appearance of lights.

01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:10.064
There are lights
in over 274 cities.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.871
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.

01:07:13.944 --> 01:07:17.971
They're appearing at or within
one mile of crop signs.

01:07:18.048 --> 01:07:20.539
They were for navigation.

01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:22.710
They made a map.

01:07:22.786 --> 01:07:27.155
They're gonna be
within a mile of us.

01:07:27.223 --> 01:07:28.952
Dad?

01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:30.390
Yes?

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.327
They think these are staged

01:07:33.396 --> 01:07:36.832
immediately preceding
an attack maneuver.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.303
I was wrong.
They're hostile.

01:07:44.174 --> 01:07:47.166
It's like "War of the Worlds."

01:07:47.243 --> 01:07:48.938
Ground forces
have been assembled

01:07:49.012 --> 01:07:51.947
in countries
throughout the globe.

01:07:53.183 --> 01:07:54.480
Hundreds of thousands

01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:57.577
have flocked to temples,
synagogues, and churches.

01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:07.126
God be with us all.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:21.805
I'm going to get back
to the windows.

01:08:31.453 --> 01:08:33.854
Hey, you guys okay?

01:08:33.923 --> 01:08:38.986
Some guy had a sign saying
it was the end of the world.

01:08:39.062 --> 01:08:40.654
Don't worry.

01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:45.260
You won't let anything
happen to us, right?

01:08:45.335 --> 01:08:46.825
No way.

01:08:49.038 --> 01:08:51.667
I wish you were my dad.

01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:54.505
What did you say?

01:08:54.577 --> 01:08:57.671
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:59.237
Ever.

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:38.810
There's too many windows
in the bedrooms.

01:09:38.885 --> 01:09:40.477
We don't have enough boards.

01:09:40.553 --> 01:09:42.350
We'll board up
the bedroom doors.

01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:43.889
Where are we gonna sleep?

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:45.219
In the family room.

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.952
What about Isabel?

01:09:47.026 --> 01:09:50.189
We'll tie her up in the garage
after dinner.

01:09:50.263 --> 01:09:52.754
I'll make some sandwiches.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:54.424
I want spaghetti.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.661
We'll just eat fast, Bo.

01:09:56.736 --> 01:09:58.761
Spaghetti sounds great.

01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:01.068
What do you want, Morgan?

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:04.109
Anything?

01:10:04.177 --> 01:10:06.475
French toast...

01:10:06.546 --> 01:10:09.413
and mashed potatoes.

01:10:09.482 --> 01:10:11.450
Now we're talking.

01:10:11.517 --> 01:10:13.985
How about you, Merrill?

01:10:16.689 --> 01:10:19.658
Chicken teriyaki.

01:10:19.726 --> 01:10:22.524
Good choice.

01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:26.224
I'm going to have
a cheeseburger with bacon.

01:10:28.234 --> 01:10:30.566
Extra bacon.

01:10:56.662 --> 01:10:59.756
What's the matter
with everyone? Eat.

01:10:59.832 --> 01:11:01.766
Maybe we should say
a prayer.

01:11:01.834 --> 01:11:02.766
No.

01:11:02.835 --> 01:11:03.927
Why not?

01:11:04.003 --> 01:11:06.198
We're not saying a prayer.

01:11:06.272 --> 01:11:08.069
Bo has a bad feeling.

01:11:08.141 --> 01:11:09.506
I had a dream.

01:11:09.575 --> 01:11:12.237
We aren't saying a prayer.

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:13.972
Eat!

01:11:14.047 --> 01:11:15.309
I hate you.

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:18.508
That's fine.

01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:20.074
You let Mom die.

01:11:20.153 --> 01:11:21.780
Morgan.

01:11:24.824 --> 01:11:28.885
I am not wasting one more minute
of my life on prayer.

01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:31.555
Not one more minute.

01:11:31.631 --> 01:11:33.861
Understood?

01:11:33.933 --> 01:11:36.367
Now we are going
to enjoy this meal.

01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:39.496
No one can stop us from enjoying
this meal, so enjoy it!

01:11:39.572 --> 01:11:41.335
Stop crying!

01:11:41.407 --> 01:11:43.671
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!

01:11:45.945 --> 01:11:48.072
All right, since you're
all not gonna eat.

01:11:48.147 --> 01:11:49.944
I'm gonna try
some of everything.

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:05.908
It's happening.

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:38.009
Graham, hurry.

01:14:02.443 --> 01:14:04.377
Did I ever tell you
what everyone said

01:14:04.445 --> 01:14:06.276
when you were born, Bo?

01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:13.548
You came out of your mama,
and you didn't even cry.

01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:15.248
You just opened your eyes,

01:14:15.322 --> 01:14:18.155
and you looked around
the room at everybody.

01:14:18.225 --> 01:14:21.217
Your eyes
were so big and gorgeous.

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:24.196
All the ladies in the room
just gasped.

01:14:24.264 --> 01:14:26.960
I mean, they literally gasped.

01:14:27.034 --> 01:14:30.663
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel."

01:14:30.738 --> 01:14:34.230
And they said, "We've never
seen a baby so beautiful."

01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:40.337
And then... you know
what happened?

01:14:40.414 --> 01:14:43.679
They put you on the table
to clean you up,

01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:46.879
and you looked up at me
and you smiled.

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:52.925
They say babies that young
can't smile.

01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:55.052
You smiled.

01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.665
Let's go down now.

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:23.449
We forgot Isabel.

01:16:02.162 --> 01:16:05.427
Should we turn off the lights?

01:16:05.499 --> 01:16:08.662
They already know we're here.

01:17:02.523 --> 01:17:05.253
Dad...

01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:19.268
Do you know what happened
when you were born, Morgan?

01:17:19.339 --> 01:17:22.001
You came out, and your mama
kept bleeding,

01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:24.669
so the doctors rushed you
out of the room

01:17:24.745 --> 01:17:26.975
before I even had time
to see you.

01:17:29.082 --> 01:17:30.879
They're on the roof.

01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:32.942
While they were fixing her up,

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.215
all she kept asking about
was you.

01:17:37.024 --> 01:17:38.855
They're in the house.

01:17:38.926 --> 01:17:42.054
I wanted your mama
to see you first

01:17:42.129 --> 01:17:46.259
because she had dreamed
about you her whole life.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:49.268
Then she got feeling better,
they brought you in,

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:51.395
and they placed you
in her arms,

01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:55.100
and she looked at you,
and you looked at her,

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:59.441
and you just stared at each
other for the longest time.

01:17:59.513 --> 01:18:01.708
And then she said real soft,

01:18:01.782 --> 01:18:06.446
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.455
You look
just how I dreamed."

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.442
The attic door.

01:18:34.147 --> 01:18:35.273
Let's go.

01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:36.475
Come on.

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:53.594
We forgot our foil helmets.

01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:55.930
Have we got anything to wedge
against the door knob?

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:57.026
They'll read our minds.

01:18:57.103 --> 01:18:58.400
You're scaring your sister.

01:18:58.471 --> 01:19:00.564
I'm already scared.

01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:05.343
Merrill.

01:19:05.411 --> 01:19:06.469
I'm looking!

01:19:06.546 --> 01:19:08.013
They'll know
our secret thoughts.

01:19:23.463 --> 01:19:26.762
I'm not ready.

01:19:26.833 --> 01:19:28.198
Merrill!

01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:29.757
Got it!

01:19:29.836 --> 01:19:32.600
Dad!

01:20:02.602 --> 01:20:05.901
Where's Bo?

01:20:13.412 --> 01:20:15.903
I'm okay.

01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:49.546
What's happening out there?

01:20:49.615 --> 01:20:51.674
I can't even imagine.

01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:54.276
I hope they're doing better
than we are.

01:20:54.353 --> 01:20:57.618
We don't even have helmets.

01:21:11.003 --> 01:21:15.736
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.

01:21:15.808 --> 01:21:17.776
Why would they do that?

01:21:17.843 --> 01:21:20.437
They want our attention
on the door?

01:21:22.515 --> 01:21:23.982
They're distracting us.

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:25.312
From what?

01:21:25.384 --> 01:21:28.251
The book says they're probably
very good problem solvers.

01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:31.779
They'll find a way in.

01:21:35.361 --> 01:21:37.591
Morgan,
give me your flashlight.

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:47.462
They used to pour coal
down in this basement.

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.974
There's a coal chute in here.

01:22:03.389 --> 01:22:06.085
I can feel air.

01:22:06.158 --> 01:22:08.092
Me too!

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.821
It's getting stronger.

01:22:09.895 --> 01:22:11.362
I'm close.

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:24.941
What?

01:22:26.545 --> 01:22:27.739
Hold him!

01:22:27.813 --> 01:22:29.110
I got him!

01:22:29.181 --> 01:22:30.341
Hold him!

01:22:30.416 --> 01:22:31.713
I got him!

01:22:31.784 --> 01:22:32.978
Hold him!

01:23:30.643 --> 01:23:33.043
We don't have his medicine.

01:23:38.317 --> 01:23:40.046
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

01:23:40.119 --> 01:23:42.485
We'll slow this down
together.

01:23:42.555 --> 01:23:44.250
Feel my chest.

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:47.190
Feel it moving in and out.

01:23:47.259 --> 01:23:49.056
Breathe like me.

01:23:49.128 --> 01:23:50.925
Breathe like me.

01:23:50.996 --> 01:23:52.623
Come on.

01:23:52.698 --> 01:23:55.189
I dreamed this.

01:23:55.267 --> 01:23:56.461
Stay with me.

01:23:56.535 --> 01:23:59.766
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.

01:23:59.839 --> 01:24:03.138
It'll pass.

01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:06.110
It'll pass.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:25.294
Don't do this to me again.

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:27.161
Not again.

01:24:31.537 --> 01:24:35.064
I hate you.

01:24:35.141 --> 01:24:37.575
I hate you.

01:24:41.514 --> 01:24:44.506
The fear is feeding him.

01:24:44.583 --> 01:24:47.074
Don't be afraid
of what's happening.

01:24:47.153 --> 01:24:50.145
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.

01:24:50.222 --> 01:24:54.249
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.

01:24:54.326 --> 01:24:58.319
The air is coming.
Believe.

01:24:58.397 --> 01:25:00.991
We don't have to be afraid.

01:25:01.066 --> 01:25:03.534
It's about to pass.

01:25:03.602 --> 01:25:08.130
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.

01:25:08.207 --> 01:25:11.142
Here comes the air.

01:25:19.585 --> 01:25:22.019
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

01:25:22.087 --> 01:25:25.454
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.

01:25:25.524 --> 01:25:29.585
Together. The air
is going in our lungs.

01:25:29.662 --> 01:25:31.892
Together.

01:25:31.964 --> 01:25:35.798
We're the same.

01:25:35.868 --> 01:25:37.893
We're the same.

01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:52.476
We should save
the flashlights.

01:26:05.263 --> 01:26:08.027
Ray's truck
swerved off the road

01:26:08.099 --> 01:26:11.591
and hit Colleen
and then a tree,

01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:15.127
and she was pinned
between the two.

01:26:15.206 --> 01:26:18.300
What does that mean...
pinned?

01:26:18.376 --> 01:26:19.673
The truck...

01:26:19.744 --> 01:26:23.737
the truck has severed
most of her lower half.

01:26:23.815 --> 01:26:25.373
What did you say?

01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:28.476
She won't be saved.

01:26:28.553 --> 01:26:31.750
Her body is pinned
in such a way

01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:35.884
that it's alive when it
shouldn't be alive,

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.987
and the truck is
holding her together.

01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:41.691
And she doesn't feel much,

01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:44.667
and she's... she's talking
almost like normal,

01:26:44.736 --> 01:26:46.897
and we didn't
pull the truck out

01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:49.132
'cause we... we wanted you
to come down here

01:26:49.207 --> 01:26:52.404
and be with her
as long as she's awake.

01:26:52.477 --> 01:26:55.241
And that won't be very long.

01:26:56.981 --> 01:27:01.077
Now, Father, do you understand
what I've told you?

01:27:03.221 --> 01:27:05.655
Caroline...

01:27:05.723 --> 01:27:09.124
is this the last time I'm
gonna talk with my wife?

01:27:10.361 --> 01:27:12.420
Yes, it is.

01:27:35.553 --> 01:27:37.544
People think they came here
to take over the planet.

01:27:37.622 --> 01:27:41.183
That's bull.
I don't think that.

01:27:41.259 --> 01:27:43.784
My friend and I saw them.

01:27:43.862 --> 01:27:46.228
I found a pack
of light bulbs.

01:27:46.297 --> 01:27:48.959
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.

01:27:51.002 --> 01:27:54.130
Nobody believes it, but they didn't 
come here for our planet.

01:27:54.205 --> 01:27:55.467
This is a raid.

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:58.873
They came here for us,
to harvest us.

01:28:02.247 --> 01:28:05.546
We're lucky as hell
they're leaving here.

01:28:05.617 --> 01:28:07.517
They're leaving?

01:28:07.585 --> 01:28:10.247
That's what they're saying.

01:28:11.823 --> 01:28:14.314
How long
have we been sleeping?

01:28:14.392 --> 01:28:15.689
12 hours or so.

01:28:17.362 --> 01:28:21.526
He said
they had poison gas...

01:28:21.599 --> 01:28:25.660
they secrete in small amounts.

01:28:25.737 --> 01:28:28.729
A lot of people died.

01:28:28.806 --> 01:28:30.899
But they're leaving.

01:28:30.975 --> 01:28:32.806
They left real fast
this morning,

01:28:32.877 --> 01:28:34.606
like something
scared them off.

01:28:34.679 --> 01:28:36.840
They left some
of their wounded behind.

01:28:40.752 --> 01:28:43.653
Why are they going?

01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:46.713
People must have figured out
a way to beat them.

01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:48.986
Everyone has a weakness,
right?

01:28:56.267 --> 01:28:59.759
You didn't think we'd make it
through the night, did you?

01:29:01.673 --> 01:29:03.197
No.

01:29:05.877 --> 01:29:07.777
Listen...

01:29:07.845 --> 01:29:13.750
there's things I can take
and a couple things I can't.

01:29:13.818 --> 01:29:17.879
One of them I can't take
is when my older brother,

01:29:17.956 --> 01:29:20.720
who's everything
I want to be...

01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:23.352
starts losing faith
in things.

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:28.524
I saw your eyes last night.

01:29:28.599 --> 01:29:31.693
I don't want to ever see
your eyes like that again.

01:29:31.769 --> 01:29:35.899
Okay? I'm serious.

01:29:40.044 --> 01:29:41.602
Okay.

01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:49.886
He's been like that
for a while.

01:29:49.954 --> 01:29:52.115
He needs his medicine.

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:56.756
Have they said anything
about our area?

01:29:56.828 --> 01:30:00.491
Philadelphia and its outlying
counties are cleared...

01:30:00.565 --> 01:30:03.159
but who knows for sure?

01:30:03.234 --> 01:30:05.862
He's not strong enough.

01:30:05.937 --> 01:30:08.030
If he has another attack
right now...

01:30:08.106 --> 01:30:09.368
I know.

01:30:11.509 --> 01:30:15.309
We'd have to be sure before
we opened up that door, Graham.

01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:41.037
It's good enough for me.

01:30:41.105 --> 01:30:42.094
Me too.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.307
Get the syringes' well.

01:31:50.374 --> 01:31:53.207
We may need to give him
an epinephrine shot.

01:32:15.566 --> 01:32:18.626
The atmosphere here is
cautiously optimistic.

01:32:18.703 --> 01:32:21.171
- People are celebrating.
- They're doing this on TV.

01:32:21.239 --> 01:32:23.036
There's a great sense
of relief.

01:32:23.107 --> 01:32:25.132
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.

01:32:25.209 --> 01:32:27.541
As we begin evaluating
the loss of life,

01:32:27.612 --> 01:32:31.378
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.

01:32:31.449 --> 01:32:35.476
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.

01:32:35.553 --> 01:32:38.317
We know the battle turned
around in the Middle East.

01:32:38.389 --> 01:32:41.984
Three small cities there found a 
primitive method to defeat them.

01:32:42.059 --> 01:32:44.289
We have no further details
at this time.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.523
Merrill, wait.

01:34:19.257 --> 01:34:22.317
Hi, sweetie.

01:34:22.393 --> 01:34:24.384
Hi, baby.

01:34:24.462 --> 01:34:30.196
I was... just taking a walk
before dinner.

01:34:30.268 --> 01:34:33.066
You love walks.

01:34:33.137 --> 01:34:36.504
It was meant to be.

01:34:36.574 --> 01:34:39.065
Does it hurt?

01:34:39.143 --> 01:34:41.304
I don't feel much.

01:34:41.379 --> 01:34:42.971
Good.

01:34:50.454 --> 01:34:52.615
Tell Morgan...

01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:54.920
to play games.

01:34:54.992 --> 01:34:56.425
It's okay to be silly.

01:34:56.494 --> 01:34:58.223
I will.

01:34:58.296 --> 01:35:01.754
Tell Bo to listen
to her brother.

01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:04.426
He'll always take care
of her.

01:35:04.502 --> 01:35:05.491
I will.

01:35:05.569 --> 01:35:07.560
And tell Graham...

01:35:07.638 --> 01:35:09.936
I'm here.

01:35:10.007 --> 01:35:12.567
Tell him...

01:35:12.643 --> 01:35:14.440
see.

01:35:14.512 --> 01:35:17.447
Tell him to see.

01:35:21.152 --> 01:35:24.087
And tell Merrill
to swing away.

01:35:28.726 --> 01:35:32.856
See, what you have to ask yourself is, 
what kind of person are you?

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:36.957
Are you the kind that sees
signs, sees miracles?

01:35:37.034 --> 01:35:41.266
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

01:35:41.339 --> 01:35:48.836
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?

01:36:14.804 --> 01:36:17.272
Swing away, Merrill.

01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:21.644
Merrill...

01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:23.702
swing away.

01:38:21.865 --> 01:38:24.095
That's why he had asthma.

01:38:28.371 --> 01:38:30.601
It can't be luck.

01:38:30.673 --> 01:38:33.437
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:36.206
No poison got in.
No poison got in.

01:38:36.279 --> 01:38:39.612
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

01:38:39.682 --> 01:38:42.116
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.

01:38:44.254 --> 01:38:46.381
Graham...

01:38:46.456 --> 01:38:49.323
Give him a second.

01:38:49.392 --> 01:38:50.689
D-Daddy...

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.193
Don't touch him.

01:38:55.498 --> 01:38:57.090
Graham...

01:38:59.903 --> 01:39:04.738
Don't... don't.

01:39:04.808 --> 01:39:07.402
Dad?

01:39:07.477 --> 01:39:09.638
What happened?

01:39:19.255 --> 01:39:22.349
Did someone save me?

01:39:24.093 --> 01:39:27.290
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
