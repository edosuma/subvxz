WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.752
<i> - Last year,</i>
<i> a competition was created</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:06.087
<i> to test the nation's</i>
<i> best bladesmiths.</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:08.423
<i> Thousands responded,</i>
<i> and this year,</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:10.258
<i> craftsmen</i>
<i> from all over the country</i>

00:10.302 --> 00:12.260
<i> and all walks of life</i>
<i> have come forward</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:14.387
<i> for their chance</i>
<i> to claim the title.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:15.972
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.265
- I want to win!

00:17.309 --> 00:18.683
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.143
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.771
<i> Now the Forge returns</i>
<i> with challenges</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:25.148
<i> unlike anything</i>
<i> ever seen before.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:27.067
You'll be using this.

00:27.110 --> 00:30.612
<i> Skill and ingenuity</i>
<i> will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:32.614
<i> Some will rise</i>
<i> to the challenge.</i>

00:32.658 --> 00:34.950
<i> Some will fall,</i>
<i> but only the best</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.702
<i> will be crowned</i>
<i> "Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:39.996
<i> and take home $10,000.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.958
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:48.755
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:50.465
<i> - I'm Ed Kim.</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:52.884
<i> I was a martial artist</i>
<i>starting from a very young age.</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:54.928
And I couldn't really afford

00:54.972 --> 00:56.805
the really high-end knives
that I wanted,

00:56.848 --> 00:58.348
so I just started banging away

00:58.392 --> 01:00.642
<i> on pieces of metal</i>
<i> in the garage.</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:02.269
<i> - My name is Ted Thompson.</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:05.313
I split my time between
knife making and tattooing.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.190
<i> Been a knife fanatic</i>
<i> my whole life</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:10.235
<i> and just started blacksmithing</i>
<i> to see if I could.</i>

01:10.279 --> 01:12.070
<i> - I'm Deker.</i>

01:12.114 --> 01:14.531
<i> I work as a computer</i>
<i> security consultant.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:16.908
Blacksmithing and knife making
is sort of a sideline

01:16.952 --> 01:19.578
<i> that I do</i>
<i> as a little bit of therapy.</i>

01:19.621 --> 01:21.538
<i> - My name's Robert Burns.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:24.833
<i> My love of knives started</i>
<i> when I was two or three.</i>

01:24.876 --> 01:27.168
And I taught myself
knife making.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.503
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

01:28.547 --> 01:31.339
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.383
You are here to participate
in three rounds

01:33.427 --> 01:37.095
of blade-making competition
designed to test every aspect

01:37.139 --> 01:40.181
of your edged-weapons-making
capabilities.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.684
After each round,
you will hand your work over

01:42.728 --> 01:44.936
to our panel of expert judges:

01:44.980 --> 01:48.607
internationally known
ABS Mastersmith J. Neilson,

01:48.650 --> 01:52.360
historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

01:52.404 --> 01:56.031
edged weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.200
They will decide which of you
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

01:59.244 --> 02:02.912
and the recipient
of a $10,000 check.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.750
All right, gentlemen,
we're coming out swinging.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.543
In your first round
of competition,

02:08.587 --> 02:11.129
you'll be using these.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.883
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.926
Lawnmowers.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.555
Your first-round challenge
is to salvage the steel you need

02:20.599 --> 02:23.558
from these lawnmowers
to forge a signature blade

02:23.602 --> 02:25.560
of your own design.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.312
<i> - I hate lawnmowers.</i>

02:27.356 --> 02:29.397
You never know
what's in a lawnmower blade.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.608
<i> I've seen blades</i>
<i> that wouldn't harden.</i>

02:31.652 --> 02:34.944
I've seen blades that would
crack if you look at them funny.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.447
<i> They're just so inconsistent.</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:39.074
- The blades themselves

02:39.117 --> 02:41.242
must fall within
the following parameters:

02:41.286 --> 02:43.745
<i> the length of the blade,</i>
<i> not including the tang,</i>

02:43.789 --> 02:47.415
<i> must be between</i>
<i> 11 and 13 inches.</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:49.334
<i> The overall length</i>
<i> of your weapon</i>

02:49.378 --> 02:52.087
<i> must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

02:52.130 --> 02:54.422
Just to keep things interesting,

02:54.466 --> 02:58.343
you must also include
a hidden tang into your design.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.470
At the end of round two,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.764
your finished weapons
will be tested and judged

03:02.808 --> 03:05.767
based on how they perform
in an ice chop

03:05.811 --> 03:07.977
<i> and slicing through a hedge.</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:10.271
You will have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.983
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.944
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.447
Your ten-minute design window
starts now.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.325
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:22.369 --> 03:24.994
<i> - The weapon I'm making is</i>
<i> more of a chopper-type knife</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:26.162
<i> just meant</i>
<i> for straight cutting.</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:27.997
<i> I'm very competitive.</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:30.208
<i> I've been a fighter</i>
<i> since my teens.</i>

03:30.252 --> 03:32.669
I fought in college
and professional MMA,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.337
<i> so it's all about competition.</i>

03:34.381 --> 03:36.840
<i> - I'm going to make</i>
<i> a camp knife</i>

03:36.883 --> 03:39.467
<i> where it's a deep,</i>
<i> sweeping recurve.</i>

03:39.511 --> 03:41.469
<i> It's got a pronounced point</i>

03:41.513 --> 03:43.096
and deep, sculpted handle.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.973
It's perfect for chopping.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.808
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:46.852 --> 03:48.601
- I try and bring
some of my design ideas

03:48.645 --> 03:50.186
from tattooing
into blade making.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.522
<i> I'm looking to make, like,</i>
<i> a recurve</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:55.525
<i> with a modified tanto tip</i>
<i> on it.</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:58.570
<i> I'm going with the recurve</i>
<i> because it's used</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:00.488
for chopping through brush.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.450
- What I'm making is
sort of a recurve chopper.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.034
It's got a little bit more mass
out front,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.911
<i> recurves a little bit back.</i>

04:06.955 --> 04:08.830
<i> Ice is an awful thing</i>
<i> to have to cut.</i>

04:08.874 --> 04:10.790
<i> It's just mean to a blade.</i>

04:10.834 --> 04:13.960
It's got to be a strong enough
blade that will hold up to that.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.380
- Bladesmiths, your ten-minute
design window is closed.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.715
Grab a lawnmower.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.510
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.512
- "Grab a lawnmower."
[all laughing]

04:24.556 --> 04:26.514
"Your forge time starts now."

04:26.558 --> 04:28.516
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

04:28.560 --> 04:30.351
Lawnmower blades
have holes in them.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.188
So just taking a blade
and making a knife out of it

04:33.231 --> 04:34.481
is not gonna cut it.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.191
- [whistling]

04:36.234 --> 04:38.193
<i> You know, this challenge--</i>
<i> it looks easy,</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:41.529
but to get the type of knife
that they're after--

04:41.573 --> 04:44.032
something that looks good,
functions properly--

04:44.075 --> 04:45.658
you know,
it's a lot more complicated

04:45.702 --> 04:48.620
than just making it flat
and grinding it out.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.582
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:54.876
- My strategy is to take
whatever piece

04:54.920 --> 04:56.711
<i> and to make it</i>
<i> as flat as possible</i>

04:56.755 --> 04:58.880
<i> as quickly as possible.</i>

04:58.924 --> 05:00.757
<i> I could've forged the piece,</i>

05:00.801 --> 05:03.551
but I decided to go
stock removal to save time

05:03.595 --> 05:06.638
<i> and to play it safe.</i>

05:06.681 --> 05:08.556
- Ed's pre-forming a tip.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.601
<i> - I've got basic, real rough</i>
<i> shape of what I want,</i>

05:11.645 --> 05:13.520
<i> and I go straight</i>
<i> to the belt grinder.</i>

05:13.563 --> 05:16.481
And I know I'm gonna spend 90%
of my time at the belt grinder.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.899
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

05:17.943 --> 05:20.944
- Deker just grabbed a can.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.571
- An unprompted
canister Damascus?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.281
- Nice.
- Nice!

05:25.325 --> 05:27.784
<i> - I need more material,</i>
<i>so I take a piece of the blade,</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:29.244
<i> put it in a canister,</i>

05:29.287 --> 05:30.745
<i> and fill it</i>
<i> with powdered steel</i>

05:30.789 --> 05:32.080
so that I can weld the billet
together

05:32.123 --> 05:33.414
and have the mass that I need.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.791
- He's using a lawnmower blade.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.125
- It'll either work
or it won't.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.585
[crackling]

05:37.629 --> 05:40.088
- It looks like Ted's got steel
in a forge.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.756
<i> - I need to thicken the steel.</i>

05:41.800 --> 05:43.466
<i> Make the blade</i>
<i> a little more substantial</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.385
and hold up to a beating.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.428
Instead of being
as wide as it is,

05:47.472 --> 05:49.264
I'm gonna take it
and narrow it down,

05:49.307 --> 05:52.141
<i> and when I narrow it,</i>
<i> it'll make it thicker.</i>

05:52.185 --> 05:55.270
- Well, Ted is by far our most
fashionable smith this season,

05:55.313 --> 05:57.480
having arrived
in a utility kilt.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.274
Don't get on the kilt.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.109
- I just--I like kilts.
I am Scottish.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.278
- I'd forge in a kilt.
<i> - When you're forging,</i>

06:03.321 --> 06:06.114
you got an 1,800-degree forge,
it makes life a lot cooler.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.449
- It takes a mighty man
to pull off a kilt.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.745
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:14.497
- Is it soup yet?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.458
<i> I've got</i>
<i> this great big canister</i>

06:17.502 --> 06:19.127
that I know is gonna take time.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.628
- I think it's
driving Deker crazy

06:20.672 --> 06:22.213
that he's got to wait
for that can to heat up.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.631
[laughs]

06:23.675 --> 06:28.219
- Bladesmiths,
30 minutes has already elapsed!

06:28.263 --> 06:30.138
- No guts, no glory.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.347
- Deker's on the move.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.682
- All right,
this should be good.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.059
- One more minute.
One more minute.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.311
I'm watching the clock.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.813
- You take your time, man.
[laughs]

06:38.857 --> 06:40.481
<i> - I'm just trying to make sure</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:41.900
that I do this right
the first time,

06:41.943 --> 06:43.985
because there's
no second chances.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.820
- There it goes.
- There we go.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.655
- Look at the glow
on that metal.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.824
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:52.201
- What is going on with Robert?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.953
He's making a hot metal bowtie
over there.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.957
- That might be his tang.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.836
- I'm getting my tang drawn out.
I'm getting my guard forged in.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.005
And everything seems
to be going well.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.340
- Did anybody realize

07:05.383 --> 07:08.134
that Robert's got
radio earphones on?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.886
<i> - I'm sure I look</i>
<i> like a crazy person</i>

07:09.930 --> 07:11.179
to everyone else in the Forge.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.555
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

07:12.599 --> 07:14.015
<i> To help me get in the zone,</i>

07:14.059 --> 07:16.059
I just turned on
the Latin music station.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.187
<i> [upbeat Latin music]</i>

07:19.230 --> 07:21.689
You know, sometimes you got
to break into a little dance,

07:21.733 --> 07:23.691
relieve the stress,
and shake it off.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.319
- [laughing]
Oh, God, no.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.863
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

07:28.907 --> 07:30.740
- [laughs]
Fun times.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.033
- Ed pretty much
has ground out

07:32.077 --> 07:33.493
the whole shape of his blade,

07:33.536 --> 07:35.244
and he's yet to go
into the Forge.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.164
- Well, he went into the Forge
to flatten that blade out, but--

07:38.208 --> 07:40.583
- Now it's
just pure stock removal.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.961
- Yeah, that--
that ain't flying with me.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.214
This is a forged blade
competition.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.341
The show's not called
"Ground in Fire."

07:48.385 --> 07:51.219
- We've seen smiths
make odd decisions to save time

07:51.262 --> 07:53.596
when they're up against
the clock.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.473
- About halfway into it,

07:55.517 --> 07:58.309
I realized that I grabbed the
piece with three holes in it.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.061
<i> So, essentially,</i>
<i> for the blade, it means</i>

08:00.105 --> 08:04.607
that the structural integrity
is greatly compromised.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.902
<i> The whole time, I'm feeling</i>
<i> regret for playing it safe.</i>

08:07.946 --> 08:12.073
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

08:12.117 --> 08:14.117
- Nice.
The core of the billet

08:14.160 --> 08:15.743
has welded, and it feels solid.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.161
<i> Now I've got</i>
<i> to get the can off.</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:22.458
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

08:22.502 --> 08:24.460
[clanking]
Damn it.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.920
- Round 15.

08:25.964 --> 08:26.963
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:28.923
- Tucker versus the billet.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.426
- It's like a bad scene
from "Groundhog Day."

08:31.469 --> 08:35.430
This is taking
an incredible amount of time.

08:35.473 --> 08:39.183
- Bladesmiths,
you have 90 minutes remaining!

08:39.227 --> 08:41.269
- Cut that in half.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.895
He doesn't need that much steel.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.356
- Son of a bitch.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.608
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get it done.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.277
- When the fatigue sets in,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.779
the steel starts hitting
the floor.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.282
- Deker's in big trouble
right now.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.117
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

08:59.581 --> 09:02.665
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:05.126
- Canister welds are never easy,

09:05.170 --> 09:07.336
<i> and no matter how many times</i>
<i> I do these,</i>

09:07.380 --> 09:09.756
it's always more work
than I feel like it should be.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.967
- Deker's still fighting.
Still fighting with his steel.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.844
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

09:14.888 --> 09:15.887
- Deker's looking
a little frustrated.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.472
- Yeah.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.682
- No, no. You got your own
[bleep] to do, man.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.851
I know that I'm gonna get
the results that I want

09:21.895 --> 09:23.227
if I just stick with it.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.229
- Here we go.
Here we go.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.689
- Get off there.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.690
- Yeah!

09:27.734 --> 09:30.485
[applause]
- Finally.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.111
- I know.
I make it look so easy.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.571
[both laughing]

09:33.615 --> 09:35.323
I might actually start
to make a blade now.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.866
- It's what we're here for.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.327
- Those two guys have a pretty
tight camaraderie.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.748
[all laughing]

09:43.792 --> 09:46.417
- Bladesmiths,
you have one hour remaining!

09:46.461 --> 09:48.002
- It's an ugly bastard,
ain't it?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.670
[grinding]
I'm grinding the knife,

09:49.714 --> 09:51.464
and it just looks
a little too plain.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.341
Think it'll take a hamon?

09:53.384 --> 09:55.510
- Could try.
- That's what I'm gonna try.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.387
- With the spring steel, it's
very unpredictable for a hamon.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.223
<i> - It's just a good way</i>

10:00.266 --> 10:02.725
to give you a hard edge
and a soft back,

10:02.769 --> 10:04.769
<i> but also being decorative</i>
<i> at the same time.</i>

10:04.813 --> 10:06.062
- See what you get.
You never know.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.730
You might get surprised.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.024
- Robert's blade looks great.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.359
both: There we go.
- In.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.528
- In the quench.
- Hold it still.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.198
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:17.242 --> 10:18.950
It's not a birthday candle,
though.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.701
- I see if the edge is hard,

10:20.745 --> 10:23.121
<i> and it hasn't hardened at all.</i>

10:23.164 --> 10:25.373
It's a big kick in the gut.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.416
- He's got his blade back in.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.378
- So Robert must not be happy
about something with his steel.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.255
- Must not.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.048
- I'm gonna try and water quench

10:34.092 --> 10:35.466
just to get it as tough
as possible.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.052
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:38.096 --> 10:39.887
- Uh-oh!

10:39.931 --> 10:41.806
What the...

10:41.850 --> 10:46.394
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:48.437
- Did you--did you judges
just see what happened?

10:48.481 --> 10:52.191
- I'm not believing this.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.068
Oh, my goodness.
- Okay...

10:54.112 --> 10:56.821
- I can feel the eyes
of the judges on me thinking,

10:56.865 --> 10:58.406
"What is this guy doing?"

10:58.449 --> 11:00.116
- My skin's crawling right now.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.576
- You quench in water,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.744
and you're almost guaranteed
to crack.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.746
<i> If I don't move on</i>

11:05.790 --> 11:07.415
because of a crappy
heat treatment,

11:07.458 --> 11:09.041
I'm gonna be mad at myself.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.460
- Bladesmiths, you have
just ten minutes remaining

11:11.504 --> 11:12.753
to finish your work!

11:12.797 --> 11:14.172
- Screw it.
In the oil.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.798
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:17.758
Whoa.
Put it back. Put it back.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.969
- Fire!

11:20.013 --> 11:24.640
The hamon looks like
it came out really, really well.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.350
Looks like a knife.

11:26.394 --> 11:30.855
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:30.899 --> 11:33.191
<i> - Time, which had started</i>
<i> pretty decent,</i>

11:33.234 --> 11:35.276
all the sudden
caught up with me

11:35.320 --> 11:37.278
really [bleep] quick.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.114
<i> Throw the knife in the forge,</i>
<i> get it up to temperature.</i>

11:40.158 --> 11:42.283
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:42.327 --> 11:44.327
- Ed's in the quench.
- Ed's quenched.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.122
- Any question, concerns, or
kudos for Ed at this point, J.?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.542
- Well, it's good
that Ed heated up the blade

11:51.586 --> 11:54.337
and got it hot
and put it in oil.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.297
- [laughing]

11:56.341 --> 11:58.799
- Bladesmiths,
you have 30 seconds remaining!

11:58.843 --> 12:00.635
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

12:00.678 --> 12:03.304
- If I duck down and talk nice
to the blade,

12:03.348 --> 12:04.847
it heat-treats better.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.350
- He's got to go now.
Got to go now.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.353
- Making atoms bend to my will

12:10.396 --> 12:13.314
to harden steel.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.815
- Check it quick.
Back in the oil--

12:14.859 --> 12:16.609
uh-oh, that's not a good sign.
- Oh!

12:16.653 --> 12:20.488
- The entire blade is
just hooked off to the left.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.823
It looks like a freaking banana.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.451
- Ten, nine, eight,

12:25.495 --> 12:28.746
seven, six, five,

12:28.790 --> 12:31.457
four, three, two,

12:31.501 --> 12:32.833
one.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.379
Bladesmiths, stop your work.
Stop your work.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.172
<i> - I'm feeling pretty nervous.</i>

12:38.216 --> 12:40.174
I know there's certain aspects
that I should have done

12:40.218 --> 12:42.927
that I didn't,
so I kind of have a gut feeling

12:42.971 --> 12:45.137
that that's gonna come back
to bite me in the ass.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.182
- Is it beer o'clock yet?
- I think it's beer o'clock.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.600
- Good job.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.352
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

12:51.396 --> 12:54.605
- Bladesmiths, we asked you
to salvage the steel you needed

12:54.649 --> 12:57.441
to forge a signature blade
of your own design

12:57.485 --> 12:58.859
in three hours.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.195
You've all done
a pretty good job.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.698
Robert, please present
your blade to the judges.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.200
<i> - I appreciate the fact</i>
<i> that you forge-welded</i>

13:06.244 --> 13:08.286
<i> this back section.</i>

13:08.329 --> 13:11.580
<i> That's smart work and gave a</i>
<i>nice distal taper to the blade.</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:14.375
The biggest concern for me
is there--there's a crack.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.085
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:16.129 --> 13:18.629
<i> I see this traveling</i>
<i> on both sides of this blade</i>

13:18.673 --> 13:20.256
<i> right at the ricasso.</i>

13:20.300 --> 13:21.716
It's a concern.
- It is.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.926
- But nice design.
- Thank you.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.970
- Looks like it would be
a really nice chopper.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.054
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:27.098 --> 13:28.556
- Deker, you're up.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.224
Please present your blade
to the judges.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.269
<i> - Deker, I really like</i>
<i> what you did with the steel.</i>

13:33.313 --> 13:35.104
<i> You went for that canister,</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:37.565
<i> which I feel is</i>
<i>a very unappreciated technique,</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:40.318
<i> especially for some</i>
<i> of the stuff we throw around.</i>

13:40.361 --> 13:42.403
So you came out
with some beautiful steel.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.239
But I would've liked to have
seen you cut that can in half.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.409
- I'd rather have more
to work with than not enough.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.785
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:51.245
- I like your design
because you've got

13:51.289 --> 13:53.748
a nice, thick spine here
to back up the edge.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.249
And we're gonna be doing
the ice chop.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.917
But a little concern on the bend

13:56.961 --> 13:58.252
because when we're gonna be
shearing,

13:58.296 --> 13:59.962
<i> it's not gonna be an even cut.</i>

14:00.006 --> 14:01.756
Aside from that,
it's a beautiful blade.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.632
Nice design.
- Thank you.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.343
- Ted, you're up next.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.470
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:07.513 --> 14:10.931
<i> - This is a very dramatic,</i>
<i> nice design.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:13.142
<i> I like the sweeping edge</i>
<i> you have there.</i>

14:13.186 --> 14:16.228
Almost as dramatic as your dress
over there in your kilt.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.565
Awesome.
Beautiful work.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.318
I didn't meant dress.
I meant the way he's dressed.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.111
- It's a skirt.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.280
- It's got a great feel to it,
Ted.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.324
And then we can see the hamon,
and that's one of the things

14:28.368 --> 14:30.451
that we're looking for is
that you went above and beyond.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.870
You went the extra mile,
and that's nice to see.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.789
Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.458
- Ed, you're up. Please present
your blade to the judges.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.169
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:43.464
<i> - Ed, I've got to get this</i>
<i> out there and ask,</i>

14:43.508 --> 14:46.342
do you know the definition
of forging?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.177
- Yes, I do.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.181
- Forging, by definition,
is using heat and a hammer

14:52.225 --> 14:55.309
to manipulate steel to a shape.

14:55.353 --> 14:59.188
From what I saw out there,
this is not a forged blade.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.649
and this is
a forging competition.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.984
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:04.028 --> 15:05.653
- All I was focused about
was on the clock

15:05.696 --> 15:07.822
when I should've been
more focused on skill.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.907
- I don't know what else
to say from there.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.992
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:12.036 --> 15:15.162
- Ed, your blade
did not make the cut.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.040
- Ed, one of the requirements
for our challenge

15:18.084 --> 15:21.001
was a forged blade,
and you ground it all out.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.711
So it's not a forged blade.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.839
For that reason,
we have to cut you loose.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.424
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:26.467 --> 15:29.260
- Ed, please surrender
your weapon.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.846
<i>- It's pretty clear why I lost.</i>
<i> I'm disappointed in myself,</i>

15:31.889 --> 15:33.556
<i> mostly because I chose</i>
<i> a safe way.</i>

15:33.599 --> 15:35.599
<i>We don't get into this business</i>
<i> to play it safe.</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:37.643
We're not knife makers
because we're timid people.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.687
<i> We're knife makers</i>
<i>'cause we're bad mother[bleep].</i>

15:39.730 --> 15:42.857
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:45.192
- Bladesmiths,
you made it out of round one.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.111
Good job.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.530
Your second challenge
is to turn your blades

15:49.574 --> 15:51.365
into fully functional weapons

15:51.409 --> 15:53.492
by attaching handles using
the range of materials

15:53.536 --> 15:55.244
provided to you.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.496
You will have three hours
for this round.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.416
You can use that time to address
any flaws or issues

16:00.460 --> 16:01.876
that were identified
with your blades.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.627
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:05.671
Your finished weapons
will then be tested

16:05.715 --> 16:07.882
for strength and durability
in an ice chop,

16:07.925 --> 16:09.925
<i> and for sharpness</i>
<i> cutting through a hedge.</i>

16:09.969 --> 16:11.552
When the time runs out

16:11.596 --> 16:13.220
and your weapons
have been tested,

16:13.264 --> 16:17.933
one of you must surrender
his weapon and leave the Forge.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.935
Good luck, bladesmiths.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.730
Your time starts now.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.273
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:24.317 --> 16:27.568
- Round one is almost like
your power round.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.237
Round two is the finesse part--
the fit and finish.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.740
- And we have seen
so many smiths

16:32.783 --> 16:35.743
hit this finesse round thinking,
"I've got it made,"

16:35.786 --> 16:37.912
and go up in flames.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.289
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:42.082
- And away we go.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.335
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:44.378 --> 16:46.462
- We rarely see a successful
burn-in.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.422
We've seen one burn-through
that worked,

16:48.466 --> 16:50.925
but rarely a burn-in
on a hidden tang.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.302
- Robert might have done a
nice burn-through in his handle,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.429
but I'd like to see him work
on that blade.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.932
I really don't want that knife
blowing apart on me

16:57.975 --> 16:59.391
during the chopping test.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.816
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:09.443
- I hit the grinder
because I got things to fix

17:09.487 --> 17:10.611
on my blade first.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.322
[grinding]

17:13.366 --> 17:16.492
- Deker's got on heck of a warp
in his blade.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.536
- That curve isn't
just on the spine.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.663
It goes all the way through
that blade.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.498
So there's really no way
to do that grind

17:22.542 --> 17:24.041
where you're taking some
off here, some off here,

17:24.085 --> 17:25.960
and some off here.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.504
- I've straightened the blade up
as good as it's gonna get.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.714
Now I've got to get to fitting
a guard.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.133
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:33.177 --> 17:36.595
I love the dance
of the little tiny file.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.264
<i> It may not be the best</i>
<i> guard-fit I've ever done.</i>

17:38.307 --> 17:40.140
Eh, whatever.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.142
It certainly isn't the best
guard-fit I've ever done.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.144
It ain't pretty, but it'll do.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.523
But it will protect the user's
finger, which is what it's for.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.317
- Bladesmiths, you have
just two hours remaining

17:50.361 --> 17:52.236
to finish your work.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.530
- What do we got
for handle material?

17:54.574 --> 17:57.324
With a hidden-tang knife,
you usually need to work

17:57.368 --> 17:59.159
with a large block.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.495
- What is that?
- Whoops.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.997
That'll do.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.665
Oh, where did my Sharpie go?

18:04.709 --> 18:07.585
There were some pieces
of red Micarta.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.462
<i> and a piece of red and black</i>
<i> Kirinite.</i>

18:10.506 --> 18:12.506
- Looks like he's putting
a brass guard on that tang.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.507
- Oh, nice.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.842
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:17.595
- Ted has got his pieces
all milled out.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.013
He's ready to go.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.349
- I decided to use epoxy
and some red dye.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.018
[whistling]

18:24.061 --> 18:25.769
The red dye
will help the epoxy blend

18:25.813 --> 18:27.896
with the red stripes
in the Kirinite.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.649
I might have [bleep] that up
a little bit.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.359
Damn it.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.070
- Ted's having some issues.
<i> - I neglected to check</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:38.365
if the brass ferrules would fit
into the holes that I drilled,

18:38.409 --> 18:40.868
and they ended up being
too small.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.287
- Not sure what he's doing,
but as long as he gets it done

18:43.331 --> 18:44.705
before all that glue dries.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.081
- That's what I'm worried about.
Yeah.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.125
<i> - Time is flying by.</i>

18:48.169 --> 18:51.378
- Ted's got quite
the red mess going over there.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.964
- It's not looking good.
Piece of [bleep].

18:54.008 --> 18:57.176
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

19:01.599 --> 19:03.682
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

19:03.726 --> 19:06.310
- Ted's just having some issues.
- Damn it.

19:06.354 --> 19:10.230
I neglected to check
if the brass ferrules would fit

19:10.274 --> 19:12.066
into the holes that I drilled,

19:12.109 --> 19:14.068
and they ended up being
too small.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.403
- Not sure what he's doing,
but as long as he gets it done

19:16.447 --> 19:17.821
before all that glue dries.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.406
- That's what I'm worried about.
Yeah.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.617
- Now I got to scrape
all of the epoxy off of it

19:21.661 --> 19:24.078
<i> before it cures</i>
<i> and get everything re-drilled.</i>

19:24.121 --> 19:25.412
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

19:25.456 --> 19:27.748
I just went up two sizes
on the drill

19:27.792 --> 19:28.999
and got the ferrules to fit.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.793
<i> They fit perfect now.</i>

19:30.836 --> 19:32.252
Nice.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.297
I just got to reapply
all my epoxy again.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.925
- Bladesmiths,
you have one hour remaining.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.551
[scraping]

19:39.595 --> 19:40.928
- Robert's sitting down
on a box.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.763
He's hand-sanding his handle.

19:42.807 --> 19:46.350
Hasn't epoxied anything.
Hasn't drilled any holes.

19:46.394 --> 19:49.103
The back end of his blade
still has cracks.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.105
- Does that make any sense
to you?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.272
- Not to me.
No.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.108
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

19:54.151 --> 19:56.985
- At this point, the time is
really starting to get to me.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.446
I couldn't find
a decent block of wood,

19:59.490 --> 20:02.616
so I had to build one
out of three slabs of Micarta.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.911
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:05.955 --> 20:09.790
- Bladesmiths, you have
just 30 minutes remaining!

20:09.834 --> 20:11.792
- [bleep]!

20:11.836 --> 20:17.297
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:17.341 --> 20:19.550
Is the highest grit belt here
400?

20:19.593 --> 20:22.177
This is not a [bleep] way
I want to go out.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.470
Ah, [bleep]!

20:23.514 --> 20:25.931
- Ten, nine, eight,

20:25.975 --> 20:29.268
seven, six, five,

20:29.311 --> 20:32.271
four, three, two,

20:32.314 --> 20:33.480
one.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.065
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.316
Drop your tools.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.693
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:37.737 --> 20:39.486
- Nice job, man.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.738
<i> - You know,</i>
<i> it's anybody's game.</i>

20:40.781 --> 20:42.698
<i> I hope my blade holds up.</i>

20:42.742 --> 20:45.576
But there's no point in stress,
because it's already done.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.077
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:47.121 --> 20:49.371
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the strength test:

20:49.415 --> 20:50.581
the ice chop.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.332
I'm gonna take
each of your blades

20:52.376 --> 20:55.210
and do downward strikes
on these blocks of ice.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.171
This is really gonna test
your edge

20:57.214 --> 21:00.424
and the overall strength
of your weapon.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.842
Ted, you're up.
Are you ready?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.510
- Oh, yeah.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.846
<i> I'd like to see my knife</i>
<i> do well in a test.</i>

21:05.890 --> 21:09.349
<i> If it does fail, I'd like</i>
<i> to see a good, flashy fail</i>

21:09.393 --> 21:11.268
from a flashy knife.
[laughs]

21:11.312 --> 21:17.691
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:17.735 --> 21:20.194
- [laughing]

21:20.237 --> 21:23.113
- Hm.
Made a mess out of that.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.364
- Yeah, it did.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.033
- Your edge held up very well.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.785
The handle feels
very comfortable too.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.620
You've got the guard
and the drop there

21:29.663 --> 21:31.538
so my hand kind of locks
into place,

21:31.582 --> 21:33.207
which is nice--makes it feel
a lot more comfortable

21:33.250 --> 21:34.249
swinging it.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.959
Nice job, Ted.
- Thank you.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.503
- Deker, you're up.
Are you ready?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.213
- Let's make a snow cone.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.381
<i> I feel that my blade's got</i>
<i> some meat to it,</i>

21:41.425 --> 21:43.217
<i> and it's got</i>
<i> a relatively thick edge.</i>

21:43.260 --> 21:45.886
But I'm a little concerned
I didn't have enough time

21:45.930 --> 21:48.305
to put the edge I wanted on it.

21:48.349 --> 21:56.355
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:57.358 --> 21:59.900
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:59.944 --> 22:01.401
- You better have
a big whiskey glass

22:01.445 --> 22:03.570
for those pieces of ice.
- May need one.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.739
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:05.783 --> 22:07.324
- Deker, the bend on the blade

22:07.368 --> 22:09.493
apparently didn't make
any difference on ice.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.079
You've also got a thicker edge

22:12.122 --> 22:14.581
that's actually backing up
your cutting edge here.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.624
Good job.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.125
- Thank you.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.919
- Robert, you're up next.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.755
<i> - I don't know if I got</i>
<i> the heat treatment spot on.</i>

22:21.799 --> 22:23.632
<i> I see these blocks of ice,</i>
<i> and they're just massive,</i>

22:23.676 --> 22:25.425
<i> and I can only hope</i>
<i> at this point</i>

22:25.469 --> 22:28.428
that everything goes well,
that I put my best into it.

22:28.472 --> 22:36.478
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:37.481 --> 22:42.442
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:42.486 --> 22:44.945
- Well, Robert,
it works on ice.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.780
We do have a few issues though.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.616
Your handle and your blade
are offset from each other.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.953
<i> So where my hand thinks</i>
<i> the edge is going</i>

22:52.997 --> 22:54.538
<i> is a little to the side.</i>

22:54.582 --> 22:56.999
And we've got a seam
that's opened up

22:57.042 --> 22:59.167
right here by the handle
as well.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.961
It did hold its edge, though.
Good job.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.297
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:03.340 --> 23:04.631
Good job, bladesmiths.

23:04.675 --> 23:05.966
Now I'm gonna pass you off
to Doug

23:06.010 --> 23:06.967
for the sharpness test.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.552
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:08.596 --> 23:11.221
- Bladesmiths,
this is the sharpness test.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.140
To see if your weapon
held its edge

23:13.183 --> 23:14.641
and maintained its sharpness,

23:14.685 --> 23:16.810
I will slash
through these hedges.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.854
If it stayed sharp,
it should cut cleanly.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.689
If not, it will
probably break the branches

23:20.733 --> 23:22.024
or just push it aside.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.317
Ted, you're up.
You ready?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.402
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

23:25.446 --> 23:30.365
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:33.454 --> 23:37.414
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:37.458 --> 23:39.249
Ted, your blade feels good
in the hand.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.043
I love the feel
of your handle here--

23:41.086 --> 23:43.170
the swell and the guard.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.672
On the passes here,
it cut some of the branches,

23:45.716 --> 23:47.090
but not all the way through.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.509
But remember, these are
freestanding branches,

23:49.553 --> 23:52.054
so after the impact,
it tends to bend.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.182
The balance of your blade
feels very good.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.351
This, sir, will cut.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.728
- Thank you.
- Good job.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.105
Deker, you're up.
Ready?

24:02.149 --> 24:03.357
- Let's do some yard work.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.359
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:05.402 --> 24:07.361
<i> I'm not happy with the edge</i>
<i> that I got on that blade,</i>

24:07.404 --> 24:08.904
and I'm concerned that the top
of the hedge

24:08.948 --> 24:11.031
is just gonna flop over
and spring right back up.

24:11.075 --> 24:19.081
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:20.084 --> 24:23.210
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:23.253 --> 24:25.337
- Deker, you have
a sharp blade over here.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.589
You know, what really helped
is that curve.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.426
On the backhand slice,
it actually grabbed more.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.220
<i> It's got a good balance to it.</i>

24:33.263 --> 24:35.305
Good recovery.
It is a light blade.

24:35.349 --> 24:36.348
Very light blade.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.433
Overall, a sharp blade.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.894
And this, sir, will cut.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.312
Good job.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.189
Robert, it's your turn.
You ready?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.066
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

24:46.110 --> 24:54.116
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:55.119 --> 25:01.415
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:01.458 --> 25:03.792
Well, Robert, you also have
a sharp blade here.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.086
It caught from the belly
to the inward curve,

25:06.130 --> 25:07.462
allowed me to slash,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.423
and the same thing
on the backhand slash.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.465
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:10.509 --> 25:12.426
The handle, though...

25:12.469 --> 25:15.303
it's not that comfortable
in the hand.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.848
But the balance of the blade
is light.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.808
It does feel good.

25:19.852 --> 25:25.105
And as you can see
with the motion here, it cuts.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.189
- Thank you.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.816
<i> - I'm not super confident</i>

25:27.860 --> 25:30.110
<i> that I'll be going on</i>
<i> to round three.</i>

25:30.154 --> 25:32.112
It's definitely anybody's game
at this point.

25:32.156 --> 25:36.783
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:36.827 --> 25:38.618
What did you guys think
of that test?

25:38.662 --> 25:40.787
- It was pretty tough.
- I thought that was cool.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.622
- Let's start
with Robert's blade.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.207
<i> - What I like about the blade</i>

25:44.251 --> 25:46.835
is the belly actually pushed
the rest of the branches

25:46.879 --> 25:48.920
into it to allow
for a very good, clean cut.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.130
- I like the shape
of your handle.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.882
- I was checking it
in my bare hand,

25:51.925 --> 25:53.467
and I should've been checking it
with a gloved hand.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.135
- I kind of like a big swell
on a handle.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.803
What I don't like
is the fact that,

25:56.847 --> 25:58.346
you know, it's out of alignment.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.432
<i> Robert spent</i>
<i> almost two hours sanding</i>

26:00.476 --> 26:03.143
as opposed to using that time
to align this blade

26:03.187 --> 26:04.728
and deal with the problems.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.980
- Moving on.
Let's talk about Deker's blade.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.982
- A curve in the blade
is obviously an issue.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.233
He tried grinding it out,

26:10.277 --> 26:11.735
so he thinned out
a lot of blade.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.653
Fortunately he had
a thick spine.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.281
- It makes it ideal
for cutting hedges.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.533
Now you're probably gonna get
requests for making

26:18.577 --> 26:21.244
a purposely warped knife.
- Purposely warped blade.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.205
- If he had a straight blade,
we could really see

26:23.248 --> 26:24.873
how sharp his blade was.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.751
On the initial pass,
the parts where that's curved up

26:27.795 --> 26:30.212
didn't catch much,
but I still can't help

26:30.255 --> 26:32.380
but appreciate
the canister weld.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.549
So we know we have
a good blade over here.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.510
- All right.
Let's talk about Ted's blade.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.678
- Is it the prettiest blade
we've ever seen? No.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.349
But it's not too heavy.
It held up beautifully.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.017
He managed to get that hamon
in there,

26:44.061 --> 26:46.019
which is really nice.
It's well built.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.730
It feels really good
in the hand.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.399
- His edge held up very well,

26:51.443 --> 26:54.736
but on the lower part,
it's just not as sharp,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.863
so I think that caused him
a little bit of an issue.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.698
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:58.742 --> 27:00.951
- Judges, which of our smiths
are we sending home?

27:00.994 --> 27:02.452
Have you made up your minds?

27:02.496 --> 27:04.704
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

27:04.748 --> 27:11.169
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:11.213 --> 27:13.713
Bladesmiths, over the last
two rounds of competition,

27:13.757 --> 27:16.800
each of you has designed,
forged, and fit and finished

27:16.844 --> 27:20.220
a blade that performed
in our weapons tests.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.888
Only two of you can move forward

27:21.932 --> 27:23.557
into the final round
of competition.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.102
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:27.146 --> 27:28.979
The judges have made
a final decision.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.064
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.399
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:32.442 --> 27:34.901
The bladesmith leaving the Forge
is...

27:34.945 --> 27:36.903
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:40.367 --> 27:42.701
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

27:42.744 --> 27:44.327
- Bladesmiths, each of you

27:44.371 --> 27:46.746
has designed, forged,
and fit and finished

27:46.790 --> 27:49.624
a blade that performed
in our weapons tests.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.293
Only two of you can move forward

27:51.336 --> 27:52.961
into the final round
of competition.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.255
The judges have made
a final decision.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.425
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:58.468 --> 28:00.260
Robert,

28:00.304 --> 28:03.138
your blade did not make the cut.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.975
- My fellow judges and I
all agree that your blade design

28:07.019 --> 28:09.769
was the most appropriate
for our tests.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.771
But the problems
in the construction:

28:11.815 --> 28:14.983
<i> the delaminations, that weld</i>
<i> that just isn't holding.</i>

28:15.027 --> 28:17.527
<i> A couple of those cracks</i>
<i> opened up even further,</i>

28:17.571 --> 28:19.779
and because of that, we
just can't let you go through.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.156
- Thank you.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.116
- Robert,
please surrender your weapon.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.659
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:24.703 --> 28:26.745
<i> - I came here to prove</i>
<i> that I was a good smith</i>

28:26.788 --> 28:28.121
<i> even though I'm young.</i>

28:28.165 --> 28:29.623
I know I did the best
that I could,

28:29.666 --> 28:31.583
and it was
a difficult competition.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.085
<i> This just helps reinforce</i>
<i> that it's a life lesson</i>

28:34.129 --> 28:38.006
<i> of knife making that there</i>
<i> are always places to improve.</i>

28:38.050 --> 28:39.633
You're never too good.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.885
<i> You're never too old or young</i>
<i> to learn.</i>

28:41.929 --> 28:48.475
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:48.518 --> 28:51.144
- Ted, Deker,
congratulations.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.021
Your work has secured your place

28:53.065 --> 28:55.440
in the "Forged in Fire" final.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.692
When you arrived here,
you forged a signature blade

28:57.736 --> 28:59.486
of your own design.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.862
Now we're sending you home

29:00.906 --> 29:03.406
to forge an iconic weapon
from history.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.660
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:06.703 --> 29:07.869
The tabar.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.996
- It's not a sword.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.164
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:11.208 --> 29:12.666
<i> - The tabar is a battle-ax</i>

29:12.709 --> 29:15.835
<i> originating from Persia,</i>
<i> Armenia, India,</i>

29:15.879 --> 29:18.046
<i> and surrounding cultures.</i>

29:18.090 --> 29:20.006
<i>Usually made entirely of metal,</i>

29:20.050 --> 29:22.050
<i> it has a strongly curved blade</i>

29:22.094 --> 29:24.511
<i> and a hammerheaded pole</i>
<i> that was often decorated</i>

29:24.554 --> 29:26.513
<i> with inscriptions.</i>

29:26.556 --> 29:29.641
<i> The light, metallic handle</i>
<i> is what makes the ax unique</i>

29:29.685 --> 29:31.518
<i> and durable in battle.</i>

29:31.561 --> 29:34.187
<i> During the 17th and 18th</i>
<i> centuries,</i>

29:34.231 --> 29:37.023
<i>the tabar was a standard weapon</i>
<i> of the mounted warriors</i>

29:37.067 --> 29:41.152
<i> of India, Afghanistan,</i>
<i> and what is now Pakistan.</i>

29:41.196 --> 29:44.197
<i> With its double-edged blade</i>
<i> and piercing spike,</i>

29:44.241 --> 29:47.158
<i> it was an unrelenting weapon</i>
<i> of war.</i>

29:47.202 --> 29:50.704
<i> This fierce weapon is featured</i>
<i> in the iconic film series,</i>

29:50.747 --> 29:52.205
<i> "The Lord of the Rings."</i>

29:52.249 --> 29:53.873
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:53.917 --> 29:56.209
It must be an effective,
working version

29:56.253 --> 29:57.919
of that deadly weapon.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.587
<i> - I have never made</i>
<i> a tabar before.</i>

29:59.631 --> 30:01.756
I have never seen
a tabar before.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.051
<i>I read a book about an elephant</i>
<i> called Babar once.</i>

30:05.095 --> 30:07.220
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

30:07.264 --> 30:09.055
- You will have five days
at your home forge

30:09.099 --> 30:10.765
to complete your work.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.434
At the end of five days,
you will return

30:12.477 --> 30:15.395
and present your tabars
to our panel of judges.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.564
Only after they've submitted
those weapons

30:17.607 --> 30:20.900
<i> to a series of brutal</i>
<i> and dynamic tests</i>

30:20.944 --> 30:23.236
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

30:23.280 --> 30:25.739
and the recipient
of a $10,000 check.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.948
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

30:26.992 --> 30:28.241
Good luck, bladesmiths.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.743
We'll see you in five days.

30:29.786 --> 30:34.456
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

30:34.499 --> 30:36.583
[dog barking]
<i> - Feels good to be home.</i>

30:36.626 --> 30:38.585
<i> Today being the first day</i>
<i> of the challenge,</i>

30:38.628 --> 30:40.920
<i> I'm gonna figure out</i>
<i> the design.</i>

30:40.964 --> 30:44.758
With the size of the tabar
being, you know, 40 inches long,

30:44.801 --> 30:47.260
<i> I'm gonna do</i>
<i> a modular construction.</i>

30:47.304 --> 30:48.928
<i> I'm gonna do the handle</i>
<i> in a piece.</i>

30:48.972 --> 30:50.472
The head's gonna be
a separate piece.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.973
The spike's gonna be
a separate piece.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.267
<i> And then I will assemble</i>
<i> everything.</i>

30:54.311 --> 30:56.102
<i> Today I'm gonna work</i>
<i> on the handle.</i>

30:56.146 --> 30:58.605
<i> There's a lot to think about</i>
<i> in getting everything</i>

30:58.648 --> 31:01.107
put together the right way.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.318
[grinding]

31:03.362 --> 31:04.778
[clears throat]

31:04.821 --> 31:07.614
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:07.657 --> 31:10.950
Right now, just a really,
really long eye-poker.

31:10.994 --> 31:16.664
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:16.708 --> 31:18.833
<i> - I'm happy to be back</i>
<i> in my own forge</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:20.377
<i> where I've got my own stuff.</i>

31:20.420 --> 31:22.462
I feel I can be
a lot more effective here.

31:22.506 --> 31:25.131
Juicy and delicious.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.008
<i> Planning on doing some pattern</i>
<i> welding for this project.</i>

31:27.052 --> 31:29.219
If it's worth making,
it's worth making a Damascus.

31:29.262 --> 31:32.263
This piece here is gonna turn
into a long bar of steel,

31:32.307 --> 31:35.225
similar to this, that'll then
get cut up into sections

31:35.268 --> 31:37.644
<i> so I can stack multiple layers</i>
<i> together</i>

31:37.687 --> 31:39.521
<i> in a billet to weld.</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:40.980
[crackling]

31:41.024 --> 31:42.482
<i> The interesting part of it</i>

31:42.526 --> 31:45.276
is that the weapon's
entirely steel.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.820
<i> There's no wooden haft.</i>

31:46.863 --> 31:48.822
<i> So that is gonna present</i>

31:48.865 --> 31:50.657
<i> some interesting construction</i>
<i> challenges, I think,</i>

31:50.700 --> 31:52.158
but it's gonna be fun.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.537
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:55.580 --> 31:57.914
<i> - Day three--it's all about</i>
<i> getting this ax-head done.</i>

31:57.958 --> 31:59.874
That's the most important part
of the tabar.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.668
I mean, you can't really have
a double-headed ax

32:01.711 --> 32:03.670
without the double-headed ax
part.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.505
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:05.549 --> 32:07.006
<i> I decided to make an ax-head</i>

32:07.050 --> 32:09.008
out of an eight-pound
sledgehammer head.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.178
<i> It's a very good</i>
<i> high-impact steel.</i>

32:12.222 --> 32:15.181
I want to be able to chop a car
in half with this thing, so...

32:15.225 --> 32:16.850
[whirring]

32:16.893 --> 32:20.019
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:20.063 --> 32:22.021
<i> I'm gonna do</i>
<i> an asymmetrical double-headed.</i>

32:22.065 --> 32:24.441
One blade's gonna be a little
bit heavier than the other.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.359
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:26.403 --> 32:29.362
<i> I'm fullering the metal</i>
<i> so it spreads wide</i>

32:29.406 --> 32:31.448
so I can start building
the beards of the blade.

32:31.491 --> 32:39.497
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:40.500 --> 32:43.042
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:45.044
Awesome.
Cool profile too.

32:45.088 --> 32:49.299
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:49.342 --> 32:51.551
<i> - So, it's day three here</i>
<i> in the shop.</i>

32:51.595 --> 32:53.970
<i> Time to get the steel</i>
<i> starting to look</i>

32:54.014 --> 32:56.389
less like a lump of stuff
and more like an ax.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.224
Inside the mind of a madman.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.642
<i> I'm going into the press</i>

32:59.686 --> 33:01.478
to do the very first
fullering operation.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.604
Defining moment.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.230
<i> I start to squish,</i>

33:04.274 --> 33:06.357
<i> and I see something</i>
<i> I never like to see.</i>

33:06.401 --> 33:08.067
[bleep]!

33:08.111 --> 33:10.945
The very end of the billet
has started to just open up.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.906
<i> I can't afford</i>
<i> to lose this billet.</i>

33:12.949 --> 33:16.409
If I can flux this before any
scale has a chance to form,

33:16.453 --> 33:18.495
I've got a chance
to save this weld.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.914
<i> But I only have seconds.</i>

33:20.957 --> 33:23.708
[whirring]

33:23.752 --> 33:25.084
It must be doing all right,
'cause I can't even tell

33:25.128 --> 33:26.961
which side it's on.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.713
<i> This is my second shot.</i>

33:28.757 --> 33:30.340
<i> And then...</i>

33:30.383 --> 33:31.758
[bleep]!

33:31.801 --> 33:33.468
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:33.512 --> 33:36.429
The hammer's not working
exactly the way it should.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.223
<i> I pretty rapidly discovered</i>

33:38.266 --> 33:40.141
that it's just not gonna be safe
to run it.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.102
It could break
and throw parts flying.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.104
[bleep]! [bleep]! [bleep]!

33:45.148 --> 33:46.856
There's just no way
I'm gonna be able

33:46.900 --> 33:48.525
<i> to get this forging done</i>
<i> by hand.</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:49.943
<i> This is bad.</i>

33:49.986 --> 33:51.444
[sighs]

33:51.488 --> 33:52.529
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:56.409 --> 33:59.369
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

33:59.412 --> 34:01.162
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:01.206 --> 34:03.665
- We're down at my
blacksmith guild's shop.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.626
The guild has generously allowed
me to use their power hammer

34:06.670 --> 34:08.962
<i> because mine just wasn't</i>
<i> gonna be able to do it.</i>

34:09.005 --> 34:14.968
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:15.011 --> 34:18.930
And just that right there
probably saved me 45 minutes.

34:18.974 --> 34:22.809
Definitely a little more sexy
than what I left with yesterday.

34:22.852 --> 34:25.979
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:26.022 --> 34:27.814
Now I've got the spike
in the forge

34:27.857 --> 34:29.148
and I've got to get that
drawn out.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.526
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:31.570 --> 34:33.152
Good gravy.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.030
The spike is gonna make
this thing heavier than hell.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.825
<i> I'm behind what I had set</i>
<i> myself for a schedule.</i>

34:38.868 --> 34:40.159
I've got a lot to figure out,

34:40.203 --> 34:41.995
and I've still got a lot
to do tomorrow.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.663
<i> Certainly hope</i>
<i> nothing goes wrong.</i>

34:43.707 --> 34:45.665
<i> But failure's not an option.</i>

34:45.709 --> 34:48.710
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:48.753 --> 34:51.588
<i> - It's day four,</i>
<i> and I'm gonna harden the ax.</i>

34:51.631 --> 34:53.464
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:53.508 --> 34:56.759
The different parts of the ax
need to be heat treated.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.178
<i> The head's gonna have to have</i>
<i> a differential heat treat.</i>

34:59.222 --> 35:01.514
<i> The edge has to be hard enough</i>
<i> to stay sharp,</i>

35:01.558 --> 35:04.517
you know, depending on what
they decide to hit with it.

35:04.561 --> 35:07.186
<i>I don't have a forge big enough</i>

35:07.230 --> 35:10.523
to fit the ax fully assembled.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.067
<i> So I used the front</i>
<i> of the forge</i>

35:13.111 --> 35:15.194
<i> and my cutting torch</i>

35:15.238 --> 35:17.030
and got it up to critical,

35:17.073 --> 35:20.700
<i> and then I quenched one side,</i>
<i> and then the other.</i>

35:20.744 --> 35:22.201
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:25.248 --> 35:27.290
Sweet.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.751
Yep, she's hard.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.878
I'm behind where I want to be,

35:31.921 --> 35:34.213
<i> but I'm not worried.</i>

35:34.257 --> 35:35.506
It'll be ready to go.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.883
Huh.

35:36.926 --> 35:44.891
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:46.811 --> 35:48.061
Let's go kill something.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.687
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:49.731 --> 35:50.730
Sweet.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.899
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:52.942 --> 35:53.900
- That's done.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.526
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:55.570 --> 35:58.488
Come hell or high water,
that's it.

35:58.531 --> 36:02.659
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

36:02.702 --> 36:04.827
- Ted, Deker, welcome back,

36:04.871 --> 36:06.746
and welcome to the sand pit.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.374
Because we're gonna be swinging
giant axes around,

36:09.417 --> 36:10.583
we thought we should come
somewhere

36:10.627 --> 36:13.503
with a little bit more
elbow room.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.755
You've had five days
to work on your tabars.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.590
Ted, how did it go?

36:17.634 --> 36:19.092
- Um, it went well.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.928
<i> I was going for</i>
<i> kind of a ancient look.</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:23.971
<i> Look like something you dug</i>
<i> out of the dirt.</i>

36:24.015 --> 36:25.973
<i> I did a lot of etching</i>
<i> on the blades.</i>

36:26.017 --> 36:28.434
<i>One side, it has lotus flowers,</i>

36:28.478 --> 36:30.436
<i> and the other side,</i>
<i> I have Persian writing,</i>

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
and it says "Forged in Fire."

36:32.524 --> 36:35.608
- Nice.
Deker, how did it go?

36:35.652 --> 36:38.277
- It went pretty well.
Long five days.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.613
<i> I wish I'd had a little more</i>
<i> time for some finish work,</i>

36:40.657 --> 36:42.824
<i> but I tried to throw</i>
<i> a little bit</i>

36:42.867 --> 36:45.618
<i> of the Indo-Persian influence</i>
<i> in with the twist Damascus</i>

36:45.662 --> 36:47.995
<i> that's on the spike,</i>
<i> and a little something new</i>

36:48.039 --> 36:49.789
<i>with the geometry of the spike,</i>

36:49.833 --> 36:51.833
<i> which is based</i>
<i> on a trocar point</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:54.252
for penetrating better.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.796
- Nice.
Well, gentlemen,

36:56.840 --> 36:58.631
your weapons look great,

36:58.675 --> 37:00.425
but this round
is all about performance.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.968
We are now gonna put
your weapons

37:02.011 --> 37:03.928
through a series of tests.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.972
First up is the kill test.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.807
Doug.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.809
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.602
The tabar's three sharp sides

37:11.646 --> 37:14.188
allows for three times the
chances of killing an opponent

37:14.232 --> 37:15.857
in the heat of battle.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.151
To test the lethality
and function of your weapon,

37:18.194 --> 37:20.027
I will test all three sides

37:20.071 --> 37:22.613
by chopping
at this animal carcass.

37:22.657 --> 37:23.823
Ted, you're up.
Are you ready?

37:23.867 --> 37:25.908
- Heck yeah.
- Let's do this.

37:25.952 --> 37:33.958
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

37:34.961 --> 37:42.967
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

37:44.471 --> 37:47.013
Well, Ted,
the design of your blade

37:47.056 --> 37:50.183
really digs in
to the carcass.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.518
The hooks grabs everything
that's in there

37:52.562 --> 37:54.854
and rips it right out.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.022
Balance is a little bit heavy,

37:56.065 --> 37:59.192
but it will do a lot
of destruction.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.195
This weapon, sir, will kill.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.696
- Awesome.
- Good job, sir.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.989
- Thank you.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.741
- Deker, it's your turn.
You ready?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.284
- Let's cut some bacon, Doug.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.453
- Let's do this.

38:10.497 --> 38:18.503
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

38:19.506 --> 38:28.262
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

38:28.306 --> 38:31.933
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.977
- Well, Deker, your edges

38:35.021 --> 38:36.437
are very sharp,
as you can see what it did.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.940
It pretty much wanted
to cut all the way through.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.733
The feel, though,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.236
is a little bit rounded
for the handle.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.239
But, nonetheless, it's light,

38:46.282 --> 38:49.408
so I can generate more power
to control it.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.787
This is a weapon
that will kill.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.164
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.334
- I'm gonna pass things off
to Dave for the next test.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.127
<i> - We're on a pretty even</i>
<i> playing field.</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:02.296
<i> We both did well</i>
<i> in the first two tests.</i>

39:02.340 --> 39:04.257
You know,
it's anybody's game, man.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.424
It's anybody's game.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.634
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

39:06.678 --> 39:07.927
- All right, gentlemen.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.762
It's time for the strength test.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.473
Now, the tabar was a brutal
weapon on the battlefield,

39:12.517 --> 39:15.935
and it was used by warriors
from India to Pakistan

39:15.979 --> 39:17.979
all the way into Afghanistan.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.605
Its all-metal construction
made it

39:19.649 --> 39:22.275
an incredibly strong weapon
on the battlefield.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.778
So to test your weapon's edge
and its shaft,

39:25.822 --> 39:28.030
we're gonna hook it
into our device over here.

39:28.074 --> 39:31.075
It's gonna take a single blow
against the shield,

39:31.119 --> 39:34.287
and then a single blow
against the barrel.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.038
Ted, you're up.
Are you ready?

39:36.082 --> 39:37.999
- I'm ready.
- All right.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.625
<i> - I don't know</i>
<i> what kind of pressures</i>

39:39.669 --> 39:42.295
they're putting on those,
but this is the test

39:42.338 --> 39:46.340
that's gonna show whether my ax
is gonna break

39:46.384 --> 39:49.468
<i> or if it's just gonna,</i>
<i>you know, bounce off of things.</i>

39:49.512 --> 39:52.972
- Three, two, one.

39:53.016 --> 39:55.308
Engaging.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.981
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

40:02.025 --> 40:04.984
- All right, gentlemen,
it's time for the strength test.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.652
Ted, you're up.
Are you ready?

40:06.696 --> 40:08.905
- I'm ready.
- All right.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.240
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

40:11.284 --> 40:14.160
Three, two, one.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.661
Engaging.

40:15.705 --> 40:25.004
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

40:25.048 --> 40:28.174
You put a really good crease
in the shield.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.343
And that's a heck of a chop

40:30.386 --> 40:34.513
you just chopped in that
hardened oak of this barrel.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.350
Little bit of a roll
right up here on this edge

40:37.393 --> 40:39.560
that hit the shield.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.229
And the shaft of the ax looks
perfectly straight.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.981
Didn't flex at all.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.233
Well done.
- Thank you.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.111
- All right, Deker,
you're up.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.529
- Let's tap a keg.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.865
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

40:52.909 --> 40:54.158
- All right.

40:54.202 --> 40:57.203
Three, two, one.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.537
Engage.

40:58.581 --> 41:01.415
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:01.459 --> 41:03.584
[clanks]

41:06.297 --> 41:07.880
- Son of a bitch.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.256
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:09.300 --> 41:12.468
- Well, Deker,
your spike sheared off

41:12.512 --> 41:14.095
right at that rivet point.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.721
- Yep.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.556
- Well, you put a good crease
in the shield.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.058
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:19.102 --> 41:20.977
See you put a good cut
in the barrel.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.229
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:23.272 --> 41:25.731
The edge of the ax here
that hit the barrel,

41:25.775 --> 41:29.402
you'll see a little coloration,
some slight shiny spots.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.113
The side that hit the shield...

41:32.156 --> 41:34.782
doesn't look
like any damage at all.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.618
But that spike coming off...

41:37.662 --> 41:39.912
well, that's a problem.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.414
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:41.457 --> 41:43.457
<i> - At the moment</i>
<i> when that spike fell,</i>

41:43.501 --> 41:45.001
my heart just sank.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.961
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:47.005 --> 41:49.839
- Gentlemen, you both put in
a lot of work on your tabars.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.049
but in this arena,
there can only be one

41:52.093 --> 41:53.759
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:53.803 --> 41:56.762
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:56.806 --> 42:00.891
Ted, you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.352
Deker, your weapon
did not make the cut.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.813
- Congratulations.
- Good job.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.314
- Deker,
you made a great weapon.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.774
The only thing
that really killed you

42:08.818 --> 42:10.609
was the structure of that spike.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.154
The rivet didn't have
enough meat on either side

42:13.197 --> 42:15.656
to hold it together--
bit of a flex in the shaft.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.033
That was the reason
we had to let you go.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.451
- Understood.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.286
- Deker, please surrender
your weapon.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.912
<i> - I came here to prove</i>
<i> to myself</i>

42:21.956 --> 42:24.790
that I could stand and deliver
on an even playing field

42:24.834 --> 42:27.001
with full-time bladesmiths,
and I'm just gonna use this

42:27.045 --> 42:29.045
as a learning experience
and get better.

42:29.088 --> 42:31.464
<i> What I learned is they're</i>
<i> the best people in the world,</i>

42:31.507 --> 42:33.632
and you just can't lose
when you hang out with them.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.385
- Ted, congratulations, you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion

42:36.429 --> 42:38.679
and will be receiving a check
for $10,000.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.680
Good job.
- Awesome. Thank you.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.432
[applause]

42:41.476 --> 42:44.310
I joined this competition
to see if I had what it took

42:44.353 --> 42:46.479
to make a better weapon
than three other guys.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.689
<i> And I did it.</i>
<i> And that makes me happy.</i>

42:48.733 --> 42:50.608
- Props for putting
"Forged in Fire" on your blade.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.651
- Yeah!
- In Persian around here,

42:52.695 --> 42:54.403
it says,
"Caution: sharp edge."

42:54.447 --> 42:55.988
- Nice touch.
- When I'm working

42:56.032 --> 42:58.324
with a bunch of guys
I really respect,

42:58.367 --> 43:00.367
<i> they're gonna push the quality</i>
<i> that I do.</i>

43:00.411 --> 43:03.579
It pushed me a lot.
That's what I enjoyed about it.

43:03.623 --> 43:08.042
