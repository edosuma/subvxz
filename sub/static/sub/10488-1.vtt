00:15.615 --> 00:16.915
<i>All right.</i>

00:27.160 --> 00:29.695
<i>We'll start this next set</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.097
<i>the North Texas,</i>
<i>Southern Oklahoma,</i>

00:32.098 --> 00:34.299
<i>crystal meth,</i>
<i>amphetamine industry.</i>

00:46.312 --> 00:48.047
<i># Strap them kids in #</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:52.618
<i># Give them a little bit</i>

00:52.619 --> 00:57.656
<i># We're going to Oklahoma</i>

00:57.657 --> 00:59.625

00:59.626 --> 01:02.361

01:02.362 --> 01:04.596
<i># 'Cause he's getting on</i>

01:04.596 --> 01:09.201

<i># He owns a quarter section</i>

<i># He cooks that crystal meth</i>

01:37.497 --> 01:42.468
<i># You know he likes that money</i>

01:51.678 --> 01:56.115

01:56.116 --> 02:00.586

02:15.735 --> 02:17.870
<i># Have us a time #</i>

02:44.531 --> 02:45.564
It's out of here.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.602
Wee-haw!

03:01.414 --> 03:03.582
Well, here we go again, buddy.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.552
Hey, Jer.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.555
I sure like your new truck.

03:12.392 --> 03:15.127
Get the hell out of here,
Norvel.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.495
Or there's gonna be trouble.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.531
See that?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.001
It's my trailer, you cheater.

03:22.002 --> 03:25.204
You tell your boyfriend
come on out here,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.972
take a look at his new ride.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.076
I told you, he ain't here.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.945
I'll knock out
his headlights too.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.318
Hey. I better get to this.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.421
Whoa, Sandy. Norvel.
Get off my head.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.090
Hey. Hey.
- Get off me.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.859
Get your hands off me.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.495
She's a cheater, Rack.

03:49.496 --> 03:53.499
Hey. Hey. Settle down.
Tell me what happened.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.468
My brother come up here today
to borrow my minnow bucket,

03:56.469 --> 03:59.938
because he's going fishing
with Bobby Bell this afternoon.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.175
So what?
He saw Jerry Buckey

04:03.176 --> 04:05.344
sneaking in my trailer,
that's what!

04:05.345 --> 04:07.246
Your brother didn't see
jack squat.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.547
Sandy, now, let him talk.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.582
Shut up, Lonnie.
Sandy, calm down.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.451
Go ahead, Norvel.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.953
Well, I raced right over here
from work,

04:14.954 --> 04:18.891
and by God if I didn't see
Jerry Buckey's truck,

04:18.892 --> 04:21.326
parked right here.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.461
And I just

04:22.462 --> 04:23.829
snapped.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.598
Well, partner,
that ain't Jerry Buckey's truck.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.701
It ain't?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.869
This truck here you tore up,

04:30.870 --> 04:33.172
that belongs to Jay Boy Simpson.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.486
Uh-oh.

04:47.487 --> 04:48.520
Now, is it true?

04:48.521 --> 04:50.923
Jerry Buckey been here
with you, baby?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.257
You know me, Rack.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.893
I'm a lot of things
but I ain't no cheater.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.563
I would never even think
of cheating on Norvel.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.831
I haven't even seen
Jerry Buckey

04:58.832 --> 05:00.933
since last Friday.
- Hey, Rack.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.402
Now, Sandy, you know
good and well Norvel loves you.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.871
Oh, the hell he does.
He never takes me anywhere.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.706
Why, he was telling me
the other morning

05:07.707 --> 05:09.775
he had big, big plans
for you this weekend.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.611
What?
Ain't that right, Norvel?

05:12.612 --> 05:16.081
Oh. Oh, yeah, Rack. It is.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.951
I was gonna take here
to eat catfish.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.085
You was?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.722
You was gonna take me
to eat catfish?

05:23.723 --> 05:25.257
Yeah.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.493
And hushpuppies too?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.762
Yeah.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.563
Oh, Norvel.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.931
I love catfish.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.467
I know you do, baby.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.136
Oh, Norvel.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.071
I'm so sorry.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.639
I'm sorry too, baby.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.742
I love you, baby.
I love you too, baby.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.944
Ain't love beautiful?

05:45.945 --> 05:47.379
Let's roll.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.314
All right, y'all,
take care.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.216
We'll see y'all next week.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.384
Bye, Rack.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.553
Bye, Lonnie.
Thank you.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.800
I don't want any thanks, either.
If he came in...

06:09.469 --> 06:11.704
Hey, babe.
Where are we going?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.872
"Hey, babe.
Where are we going?"

06:15.141 --> 06:17.176
Cam, I'm late. I'm sorry.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.346
There's late,
and there's too late.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.281
You're the second.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.616
I had to take that prisoner
over to Lawton.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.185
What am I suppose to tell
the sheriff?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.187
You tell him it's
your girlfriend's birthday

06:28.188 --> 06:29.855
and you're suppose to be home
hours ago.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.024
I did.
- Oh, yeah? What did he say?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.792
He said, "Take that prisoner
over to Lawton."

06:35.295 --> 06:37.563
You know what?
I'm just sick of your excuses.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.931
It's always,
you're working late

06:38.932 --> 06:40.566
or you're there with
your buddies.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.701
You know what? I'm really glad
you're having a good time.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.137
I'm glad you like to party.
I'm glad you like to have fun.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.106
But unfortunately,
you never like to do it with me.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.008
Cammie.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.243
Cammie.
I got you something, baby.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.213
This ought to be good. What?

06:54.214 --> 06:56.849
Oh, it's nothing big.
It's just a little something

06:56.850 --> 07:00.019
I wrapped up in a pair
of underwear. Threw in my pants.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.622
Jerk!
- Damn, Cammie.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.691
Damn, Cammie, don't.
This is crazy.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.498
Do you remember
your birthday last year?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.033
Let me remind you.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.703
I put on that sleazy little
cocktail outfit,

07:17.704 --> 07:21.340
just like that floozy-ass poker
waitress you like so much

07:21.341 --> 07:23.409
down at the Indian casino.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.977
You came in here,

07:24.978 --> 07:26.478
you didn't say hello.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.281
You sat on that couch, you eat
pork rinds, drink beer,

07:29.282 --> 07:32.084
and you fell asleep watching
<i>Coal Miner's Daughter.</i>

07:32.085 --> 07:33.285
That was real nice.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.223
I like <i>Coal Miner's Daughter.</i>
Cammie.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.327
You hit my mower.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.629
Asshole.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.771
What have I done?

08:06.186 --> 08:09.788
Well, looks like Daddy's gonna
have to get him a new mower.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.165
Oh, yeah, Rack,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.367
looking good.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.905
Hey, boys, what you doing?

08:34.881 --> 08:36.782
Damn, Lisa,
you're looking good, baby.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.417
I wonder if
she's still mad at me?

08:38.418 --> 08:39.418
Hey, Lis.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.953
Ooh...

09:09.416 --> 09:12.051
Mornin', Peabody.
- All right.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.153
Uh, hey, you got a little

09:14.154 --> 09:15.354
donut right there on you.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.755
Here?
No, over here.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.595
Mornin', Rack.
- Mornin'.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.298
I forgot to tell you yesterday,
Cammie called.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.633
Oh, yeah?
Is she okay?

09:27.634 --> 09:30.736
She's fine. How's George doing?
- Just horny as hell.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.172
Well, I can see why.
- You know, that's nice.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.740
But ever since he sold
my ThighMaster,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.642
my ass just swelled up.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.713
Well, cowboys
like fat calves.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.249
I hear the hardware store
is having a sale on lawn mowers.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.885
You might wanna get one.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.960
What's up, Skunk?

09:56.696 --> 09:59.131
I did it. I did it, Rack.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.067
I taught Junior how to detect
the smell of drugs. Sit, boy.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.702
Sit, Junior. No.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.004
Stay.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.875
You're gonna love this.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.976
Drugs.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.645
No peeking.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.447
Okay. Here we go.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.383
Okay, boy.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.319
Find the drugs, Junior.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.488
Hold on.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.490
Come here, Junior.
Turn around.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.791
Now get ready.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.026
All right. Come on.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.594
Here we go.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.764
All right, Junior, go ahead.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.132
Find the drugs.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.101
Find the drugs, Junior.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.072
Come on, Junior.
Find the drugs.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.141
Give him a second.
- That's really good, Lonnie.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.942
You know, he might actually
be able to find them

10:43.943 --> 10:45.244
if you glue them to his balls.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.990
What are you turds up to?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.125
Uh, nothing, sheriff.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.960
Well, we're gonna have to
change that.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.829
You boys are working
this weekend.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.764
Work?
- Yeah, work.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.933
It's the opposite of what
you usually do.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.568
Jackson County Co-Op.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.271
You're gonna stake it out
Saturday night.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.306
Someone's been stealing
anhydrous ammonia

11:14.307 --> 11:16.375
from the co-op tanks
and we're gonna catch them.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.911
Well, why would anybody
wanna steal fertilizer?

11:18.912 --> 11:22.081
Why would anyone
name a baby Lonnie?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.882
It's what they use
to cook meth with.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.384
Sheriff Wells over at Altus

11:25.385 --> 11:27.553
says it's getting to be
a big problem over there.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.655
These smaller co-ops
are easier to hit.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.558
Sheriff, why can't
these two guys do the stakeout?

11:32.559 --> 11:35.260
Well, because I said so,
that's why.

11:35.261 --> 11:38.130
Besides, these boys worked
the high school prom

11:38.131 --> 11:40.432
last Saturday night.
- That's nice.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.834
Least they were working
this time.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.436
Last time they were at prom,
I believe they went as a couple.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.407
Eat me.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

11:48.408 --> 11:49.875
Ah, ah.
That's quite enough.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.577
We'll take care
of this, sheriff.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.512
See you boys Monday.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.118
You get rid of that--
That damn dog, will you?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.020
Well, it's a K9 recruit, sir.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.921
Right. Get rid of it.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.091
Skunk?

12:07.827 --> 12:10.529
You're a deputy.
Try to look like one.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.033
Where is your gun?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.637
Where's your badge?

12:24.544 --> 12:26.178
Why do I try?

12:35.155 --> 12:36.889
This sucks.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.358
Staring at fertilizer tanks
on a Saturday night.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.826
It's ridiculous.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.961
Why don't you try complaining
a little bit more about it.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.630
See if that helps.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.166
You got something better to do?
- I did.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.469
I was gonna stay home
and take off all my clothes.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.071
Becky was gonna
take off all her clothes,

12:52.072 --> 12:53.739
and we were gonna do
some other stuff

12:53.740 --> 12:56.875
that didn't include looking
at fertilizer tanks with you.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.479
How come Skunk never talks?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.147
He speaks when he's got
something to say.

13:02.148 --> 13:05.284
I've known him my whole life,
he's never said one word to me.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.552
Yeah, he don't talk much.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.788
But he is about the best cop
I ever knew.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.156
I'm a-pretend
I didn't hear that.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.561
How come he carries
that bow and arrow?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.663
You mean, you don't know?
- No.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.166
Skunk was orphaned
at a real young age,

13:21.167 --> 13:22.835
and raised on a reservation

13:22.836 --> 13:25.371
by a great Kiowa
Indian war chief.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.538
I didn't know that.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.208
Yeah. You know that, uh,
pilgrim-looking fellow

13:29.209 --> 13:31.110
on the outside of
the Quaker Oats box?

13:31.111 --> 13:33.345
You mean, the one that
looks like Barbara Bush?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.980
Yeah, him.
- Yeah.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.584
Skunk's great, great
grandfather killed him.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.686
Really?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.588
Wow...

13:42.589 --> 13:45.491
And then he cooked him
in less than a minute.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.595
That's bullshit.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.264
It is bullshit.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.134
But he was raised on
a reservation. I promise you.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.605
Dang, Lonnie. God.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.673
What?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.141
You got a sour stomach?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.309
I didn't do that,
Junior did.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.012
Hey, you know what? I've noticed
something about Junior.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.615
Whenever he farts,
something big's about to happen.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.425
I wonder what
these boys doing out here

14:19.426 --> 14:20.626
in the middle of the night.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.594
You reckon it's those
fertilizer takers?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.396
Fertilizer takers?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.901
He's cutting the lock off
the gate.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.036
He don't work here.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.172
If he worked here,
he wouldn't do that.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.274
Let's go, Lonnie.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.844
Take your gun off safety
this time.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.690
Got it, boss.
- Hurry up.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.891
Let's do it.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.127
Twenty-five gallons,
five minutes.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.729
Twenty-five. Make it happen.
Let's go.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.666
Freeze!
- Yeah. What he said.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.102
Shoot them, <i>pendejo.</i>

15:05.672 --> 15:06.905
Damn it, Lonnie.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.474
Let's go. Let's go.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.715
I wouldn't do that.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.933
I give up.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.539
Go. Hurry.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.209
Watch these two.
I'll get these other guys.

15:45.879 --> 15:49.214
You boys familiar with
good cop/bad cop?

15:49.215 --> 15:51.617
Well, the good one just left.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.819
Go, go, go.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.894
What happened?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.071
<i>This is Rack.</i>

16:12.072 --> 16:14.306
All units in the vicinity,
be advised.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.242
Rack, uh, this is Peabody.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.178
What's your--?
What's your...?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.946
<i>Twenty. What's my 20?</i>

16:20.947 --> 16:22.414
Yeah. Your 20.
What's your 20?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.783
I'm in the back of
an old black one-ton flat bed.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.186
Request all available backup.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.154
Lonnie and Skunk with you?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.389
That's affirmative.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.891
Uh, that is
all available backup.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.167
You're under arrest.
Don't make me come in there.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.776
Now you've pissed me off.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.065
Boy, we sure nailed them.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.133
That elbow of yours is lethal.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.235
I'm-a tell you what,
you hit that guy so hard,

17:50.236 --> 17:53.272
I will never risk you catching
me peeing in your coffee again.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.379
You get the personal items off
the prisoner, file them for me.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.047
You got it.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.249
Well, boys, we're
gonna need all your stuff.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.918
Watches, wallets.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.387
Pictures of your boyfriends.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.855
Y'all look like hell.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.658
We might have to run out
and buy y'all some Bactine.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.760
We got everything?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.165
Well, fellas...

18:21.935 --> 18:24.436
Hey, uh, I'm gonna need
that necklace.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.672
Do you want this?

18:26.673 --> 18:27.740
Yeah.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.610
You cannot have this.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.549
Do you understand
what I say to you?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.685
This is <i>familia.</i>

18:41.187 --> 18:42.187
You keep your necklace.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.655
Because where you're going,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.958
that necklace ain't gonna
be able to help you.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.307
You boys sleep tight.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.877
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

19:12.185 --> 19:16.355
<i># Honey, let's get trashed</i>
<i>And throw it all away #</i>

19:19.826 --> 19:21.493
All right.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.863
That figures. We're out
working, they're out drinking.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.100
Oh, now, what are you three
stooges doing in here?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.769
Yeah, shouldn't you girls
be on the stakeout?

19:30.770 --> 19:33.472
Actually, where we should be
is over at your daddy's house,

19:33.473 --> 19:36.575
kicking him in the potatoes
for having sex with your momma.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.243
Hey, now, don't--

19:38.244 --> 19:40.179
We always work more
than they do, sheriff.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.381
Actually, they did have to
work tonight.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.617
Norvel and Sandy
went out to Catfish Cove,

19:45.618 --> 19:47.286
and they run into
Jay Boy Simpson.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.488
That was one hell of a fight.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.958
Hey, ain't that my bat?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.195
Ow!

19:56.196 --> 19:58.330
Well, it ain't love beautiful.
Ain't love beautiful.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.500
Hey, Jake,
how about

20:01.501 --> 20:03.902
a round of shots for the table
and three beers?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.437
Table number seven.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.139
What happened out there
tonight?

20:07.140 --> 20:11.710
Oh, nothing big. High-speed
chased, little scuffle.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.812
Rack?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.581
Caught four guys
stealing fertilizer.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.083
Three of them were just local
lowlifes for hire,

20:18.084 --> 20:20.619
but this one guy, he's
a Mexican guy. I don't know.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.122
He may be connected. He
seemed to be running the show.

20:23.123 --> 20:24.923
Any idea who that might be?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.259
We're working on it.
I'll know something soon.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.895
Anybody hurt?
- Sheriff, this one guy

20:29.896 --> 20:32.164
took one of Skunk's
broadheads right in the ass.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.169
He's lucky my boy didn't put one
through his pump station.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.438
Ain't that right, Skunk?

20:39.439 --> 20:42.374
That damn bow and arrow
of yours.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.144
Well, listen, here,
I wanna congratulate you boys.

20:45.145 --> 20:46.645
A little toast.
- Here we go.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.447
Whiskey for my men.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.648
Beer for my horses.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.383
<i># Let's get trashed #</i>

20:51.384 --> 20:55.788
<i># And throw it all away #</i>
- <i># Throw it all away #</i>

20:59.492 --> 21:01.894
"And his sweat
was like drops of blood

21:01.895 --> 21:04.096
falling on the ground."

21:04.097 --> 21:07.299
"When he rose from prayer
and went back to the disciples,

21:07.300 --> 21:08.667
"he found them asleep,

21:08.668 --> 21:11.337
exhausted from sorrow."

21:11.338 --> 21:12.905
"'Why are you sleeping''

21:12.906 --> 21:14.206
"he asked.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.941
"'Get up and pray

21:15.942 --> 21:18.677
so that you will not fall
into temptation.'"

21:18.678 --> 21:20.179
Amen.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.716
If you want salvation,
brethren...

21:23.717 --> 21:25.818
Lonnie?
...you got to open your ears

21:25.819 --> 21:27.820
and listen to the word
of the Lord.

21:27.821 --> 21:31.023
Amen.
You've got to open your eyes

21:31.024 --> 21:32.558
and look into the book

21:32.559 --> 21:35.027
and learn to live
by the word of the Lord.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.562
Amen.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.397
You must wake up
and smell the Bible.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.566
A...men.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.067
Ain't that so,
Lonnie Freeman?

21:43.503 --> 21:44.737
Amen.

21:54.014 --> 21:55.581
Reverend Parker,

21:55.582 --> 21:58.083
that was a wonderful message
you gave today.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.386
Really?
What was your favorite part?

22:00.387 --> 22:03.956
Oh, you know, the whole thing
about God being great.

22:03.957 --> 22:07.292
And devil being an ass
and stuff.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.794
I feel like a new man.

22:08.795 --> 22:12.464
Oh, I bet you do considering
all the sleep you got.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.832
Come on, Becky.
- Thank you.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.034
Lonnie.

22:15.035 --> 22:18.337
We'll see you tomorrow, Lonnie.
- Okay, buddy.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.973
We missed Cammie this morning.
Is everything okay?

22:20.974 --> 22:23.242
She's just fine. She's a
little bit under the weather.

22:23.243 --> 22:26.378
You know, couples just don't
seem to stay together anymore.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.647
It's kinda sad.
- Heh.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.482
Yeah, it's sad, all right.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.385
Well, I'll see you later,
preacher.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.988
Rack?
- Yeah?

22:35.989 --> 22:38.924
You can borrow my lawn mower
any time you need it, son.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.307
Johnny Franks? Heh.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.544
I thought youse in jail.
- Nope.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.847
You staying out of trouble, boy?
Oh, yes, I am, Mr. Deputy, sir.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.549
Yes, sir.
- Good.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.883
You ain't.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.853
Are you high, Johnny?

23:07.854 --> 23:10.089
You screwed up, deputy.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.924
Bigtime.
- Yeah.

23:11.925 --> 23:15.294
You know that, uh--?
That Mexican guy you arrested?

23:15.295 --> 23:17.196
His name's Tito.

23:17.197 --> 23:19.365
And his brother,
he's gonna kill you.

23:19.366 --> 23:21.233
Somebody's gonna kill me?

23:21.234 --> 23:24.069
That's big news, Johnny.
- Thanks.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.171
Here's some news for you.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.606
You're not a rapper.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.174
So pull your pants up.
- What--?

23:31.044 --> 23:33.012
You know, you don't know
who you're messing with.

23:33.013 --> 23:34.646
They'll kill you
if you're ain't careful.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.515
You let me worry about that.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.584
Boogie.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.885
They'll kill you.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.722
Hey, Lonnie.
- Hey, Rack. Heh!

23:45.191 --> 23:46.992
That's my partner.
- Well.

23:46.993 --> 23:50.229
Twist my nipples, look who's here.
- Hey, darling.

23:50.230 --> 23:52.664
You lookin' a little rough
this morning, Rack.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.833
Oh, I'm all right.
- Where's Cammie?

23:54.834 --> 23:58.003
She went on vacation.
- Really? Where'd she go?

23:58.004 --> 23:59.438
I'm not sure.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.207
You-all break up again?

24:02.208 --> 24:03.175
Yeah.
- I already heard.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.577
You want your usual, baby?

24:07.414 --> 24:08.514
And then Junior farted,

24:08.515 --> 24:10.149
and I knew something big
was gonna happen.

24:10.150 --> 24:12.351
Then, about that time,
the tip of the Zebco

24:12.352 --> 24:13.819
just went straight down
in the water.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.120
And I just set the hook.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.589
And I fought that son of a bitch
for about 20 minutes.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.193
It was a snapping turtle.

24:22.362 --> 24:24.897
Rack, I am surprised
you even let him carry a gun.

24:26.099 --> 24:28.567
Do you hear Annie Streets
was back in town?

24:28.568 --> 24:29.802
No, really?
- Yeah.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.637
Her momma
got the Alzheimer's,

24:31.638 --> 24:34.406
and she flew in from Chicago,
help take care of her.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.975
Well, what about her stepdad?
Don't he take care of her?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.510
Buck Baker? Shit.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.713
All he cares about
is making money.

24:40.714 --> 24:42.548
He's too busy
trying to bully farmers

24:42.549 --> 24:45.284
into selling him their land
for a dime on the dollar.

24:45.285 --> 24:48.053
Hell, he practically owns
every farm in the county now.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.588
He never got Daddy's farm.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.757
Well, he's one of the few
that stood up to him.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.692
Rest his soul.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.428
When I was dating Annie,
me and him never got along.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.830
You know,
I always just knew

24:57.831 --> 24:59.898
you two would get married
someday.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.067
She wanted to go off
and see the big city.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.469
There's no way I was leaving.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.840
You've still got it for her.
You always have.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.441
Why don't you go see her?

25:09.442 --> 25:11.677
She probably got some
big high-dollar boyfriend

25:11.678 --> 25:13.779
back in Chicago.
I saw her here the other day.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.781
She didn't have no ring
on her finger.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.950
We had our time together
a long time ago.

25:17.951 --> 25:22.087
Anybody ever tell you
you are stone lazy?

25:22.088 --> 25:24.923
Annie is the only female
ever come close

25:24.924 --> 25:26.458
to giving you a run
for your money.

25:26.459 --> 25:28.660
And that's what you were
missing in your life,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.162
in case youse a-wondering.

25:30.163 --> 25:32.531
So why don't you leave me
a big fat tip,

25:32.532 --> 25:35.300
get off your sorry ass,
and go see her?

25:35.301 --> 25:38.337
And take her something nice.

26:04.497 --> 26:07.666
It's a little cool
out here.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.968
Here you go.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.270
Keep you warm.

26:17.377 --> 26:19.011
Oh, my God.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.045
Momma?

26:21.548 --> 26:23.315
Joe Bill Racklin.

26:23.316 --> 26:24.917
What in the world?

26:24.918 --> 26:26.819
Hi, Annie.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.787
What are you doing out here?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.856
Oh, I don't know. I guess
I just wanted to come out here

26:30.857 --> 26:34.059
and see what a big-city girl
looks like these days.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.061
Heh! Oh, yeah, well,
what do you think?

26:36.062 --> 26:38.597
Well, she looks a lot
like a, uh, small-town girl

26:38.598 --> 26:40.566
I used to know
a long time ago.

26:40.567 --> 26:41.900
Pretty as a picture.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.470
Oh, stop it, Rack. What
are you really doing out here?

26:44.471 --> 26:46.572
Well, actually, I came here
to bring you some corn dogs

26:46.573 --> 26:47.806
from the Tasty Cream.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.843
I remember how much you
used to like them so much.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.347
Wow.

26:55.348 --> 26:57.049
Well, I didn't really
have much of a choice,

26:57.050 --> 26:58.917
'cause it was the only place
you'd ever take me.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.720
Uh, I got you
some, uh...

27:03.790 --> 27:05.024
mustard here somewhere.

27:06.426 --> 27:07.326
Damn.

27:09.396 --> 27:12.564
I got you the wrong one.
I got ketchup. I got--

27:12.565 --> 27:14.433
Rack,
you haven't changed a bit.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.368
Is that a good thing?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.936
Yeah, I guess.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.472
Been a long time, Annie.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.775
Yeah, it sure has.

27:22.776 --> 27:26.245
So, uh, Buck's got quite a place
here, huh?

27:26.246 --> 27:28.647
Yeah, it's changed a lot
since I left.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.683
He bought up a whole lot
of acreage.

27:30.684 --> 27:32.551
See all those buildings
over there?

27:32.552 --> 27:33.752
All new.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.021
Trucks a-going
day and night.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.123
Wow.
- Yeah.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.592
Mrs. Baker?

27:42.028 --> 27:44.163
I think the last time
I was out here was when you--

27:44.164 --> 27:45.798
Hey, Rack.

27:45.799 --> 27:47.766
How you doing there,
buddy?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.068
Hey, Buck.

27:49.069 --> 27:52.137
How's the, uh, deputy life
suiting you?

27:52.138 --> 27:54.106
It's honest dollar.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.843
An honest dollar.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.112
You and your daddy both.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.950
I was sorry to hear
about his heart attack.

28:04.951 --> 28:08.320
Looks like he kinda
worked himself to death, huh?

28:08.321 --> 28:10.022
Rack, why don't you
come on inside

28:10.023 --> 28:11.890
and I'll fix you
some sweet tea?

28:11.891 --> 28:14.193
Oh, that's okay, Annie. I
probably gotta get back to town.

28:14.194 --> 28:19.231
I got some deputy stuff
I need to go take care of.

28:19.232 --> 28:20.833
I'll see you.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.568
Hey, Rack!

28:22.569 --> 28:27.306
If you, uh, ever decide
to sell your daddy's farm,

28:27.307 --> 28:28.874
call me first.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.112
Hell, you ain't no farmer, son.

28:33.113 --> 28:35.314
You're a bigtime deputy.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.454
Does it take practice
being a grade-A asshole, Buck,

28:42.455 --> 28:44.423
or were you just born one?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.899
Born one.

29:01.141 --> 29:03.876
Hey, buddy.
Are we still going pig hunting?

29:03.877 --> 29:06.445
I thought you and Becky
was going over to Lawton.

29:06.446 --> 29:08.647
No, she's, uh, keeping
her sister's kids and that,

29:08.648 --> 29:10.249
so Daddy's got a hall pass.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.018
Well, by God, then it looks like
we're going pig hunting.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.253
What the hell
are you doing?

29:14.254 --> 29:15.888
Rack, watch this.

29:15.889 --> 29:17.456
Okay, Junior.

29:17.457 --> 29:18.657
Bite me, boy.

29:20.393 --> 29:22.428
Bite me, Junior.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.797
Bite me, Junior.
Junior, bite me.

29:24.798 --> 29:26.899
He did it earlier.
Come on, Junior.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.102
Bite me. Damn it, Junior.
Attack me.

29:30.103 --> 29:31.770
Lonnie, cut that racket,
will you?

29:31.771 --> 29:33.439
Get rid of that fleabag.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.841
Yes, sir.
Come on, Junior.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.176
Let's go.

29:37.177 --> 29:38.811
Any news on that Mexican boy?

29:38.812 --> 29:40.546
Uh, we send the prints
over to the feds.

29:40.547 --> 29:42.214
We're still waiting
on a positive ID.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.916
Okay.
Hey, Mavis?

29:43.917 --> 29:46.318
We get that, uh, fax in
from Oklahoma City yet?

29:46.319 --> 29:49.521
No, but you'll be
the first to know when I do.

29:50.657 --> 29:52.257
Sheriff in?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.793
How about a "good morning"?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.462
Just tell the sheriff I'm here.

29:59.332 --> 30:01.734
Hey. Ungh!

30:01.735 --> 30:04.803
Sheriff, the DA's here.
- What's he want?

30:04.804 --> 30:07.106
An ass-whupping,
the way he's talking to me.

30:07.107 --> 30:09.575
Mavis, you send him on
back here then.

30:09.576 --> 30:11.410
Oh, that's--

30:16.649 --> 30:19.418
I knew I smelled
something rotten.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.688
Well...

30:22.689 --> 30:25.224
Hear you boys had a big weekend.

30:25.225 --> 30:27.226
Congratulations
on the arrests,

30:27.227 --> 30:30.863
but, uh, we need to discuss
this case.

30:30.864 --> 30:32.164
What's to discuss?

30:32.165 --> 30:34.166
Well, I spoke
with the judge,

30:34.167 --> 30:36.402
and we don't think we have
a good enough case--

30:36.403 --> 30:38.037
You don't have a good case?
- No.

30:38.038 --> 30:39.905
We caught 'em stealing
red-handed.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.775
Fertilizer.

30:42.776 --> 30:45.310
Caught 'em stealing fertilizer.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.479
Heh! Frankly, gentlemen,

30:47.480 --> 30:50.582
we feel this entire affair
has been totally mishandled.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.518
Mishandled?
They fired shots at us.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.987
Rack, let me handle this.

30:54.988 --> 30:56.055
Close the door.

30:58.124 --> 31:01.326
I mean, close the door with you
on the other side of it.

31:10.770 --> 31:12.871
Now, the truth of the matter is

31:12.872 --> 31:15.641
we don't really know
what these boys were planning

31:15.642 --> 31:17.476
on doing with the fertilizer.

31:17.477 --> 31:20.212
We all know what they were
gonna do with that fertilizer.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.580
They weren't tending
sick lilies.

31:21.581 --> 31:22.981
They're making meth.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.684
Then we should have had the feds
come in and take care of it.

31:25.685 --> 31:27.586
You've already
blown the opportunity

31:27.587 --> 31:29.455
to set up
surveillance operations,

31:29.456 --> 31:31.824
tracking their money sources,

31:31.825 --> 31:33.559
making them lead us
to the big boys

31:33.560 --> 31:36.395
in their manufacturing
and distribution network.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.429
And now,

31:37.430 --> 31:41.500
because of your, uh,
rogue deputies there,

31:41.501 --> 31:45.738
we got nothing to show for it,
except maybe a lawsuit

31:45.739 --> 31:48.707
for skewering a man's buttocks
with an arrow.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.042
I mean-- Hee-hee!

31:50.043 --> 31:52.878
What the hell kind of a
department are you running here?

31:57.450 --> 31:59.685
Is this what you've been
waiting for, Rack?

32:01.187 --> 32:02.454
Yeah.

32:02.455 --> 32:05.758
This may be of interest to you,
Mr. DA.

32:05.759 --> 32:08.093
Tito Garza,
wanted on federal charges.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.030
Drug trafficking, racketeering,
attempted murder charge.

32:11.031 --> 32:13.432
Feds want us to deliver him
to Oklahoma City on Saturday.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.535
Well, I'll, uh, run that by
the judge, see what's what.

32:16.536 --> 32:18.504
You may wanna take a look
at that file too, sheriff.

32:18.505 --> 32:21.206
Thank you, Mavis. Well, what
have we got here? Who's this?

32:21.207 --> 32:24.109
That's Manny Garza.
That's Tito's brother.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.377
He heads up-- Oh, nothing.

32:25.378 --> 32:28.213
--just the biggest drug cartel
in all of Mexico.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.549
Well, this is
terribly interesting,

32:30.550 --> 32:33.152
but I am due in court.

32:33.153 --> 32:34.953
If you'll excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.957
You have a nice day, Mr. L.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.260
Fall out boys,
off your ass, on your feet,

32:41.261 --> 32:42.628
out of the shade
and in the heat.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.730
We're going to the courthouse
for your arraignments.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.665
On the hop.
Let's go, move it, girls!

32:46.666 --> 32:48.567
Get out!
- Hey, easy.

32:48.568 --> 32:51.003
Not you, hotshot.

32:51.004 --> 32:53.472
You earned yourself a few more
nights here at the five-star.

32:53.473 --> 32:56.075
Looks like you got a big date
with the FBI.

32:56.076 --> 32:58.744
You know, my brother gonna come
looking for you.

32:58.745 --> 33:01.213
And you're not gonna like it
when he finds you.

33:01.214 --> 33:05.084
Heh-heh! Well, you tell
your brother this, tough guy.

33:05.085 --> 33:07.519
I'm easy to find.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.456
Thursday night,
I'm pig hunting with Lonnie.

33:10.457 --> 33:13.325
Friday night, I'm drinking beer
at the Thirsty Monkey.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.793
Saturday morning,
I'll be at my house

33:14.794 --> 33:16.495
drinking coffee
at the kitchen table.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.030
And Saturday afternoon,

33:18.031 --> 33:20.099
I'm taking your ass
to Oklahoma City

33:20.100 --> 33:23.002
so you can find a horny convict
to be your love piñata

33:23.003 --> 33:25.270
for the next 50 years.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.006
<i>Comprende?</i>

33:27.007 --> 33:28.374
Come on, Lonnie.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.576
Let this guy stay here.

33:48.962 --> 33:50.362
Hey, stranger,
what are you doing?

33:50.363 --> 33:51.897
I was about to ask you
the same thing,

33:51.898 --> 33:54.066
driving down the wrong side
of the road like that.

33:54.067 --> 33:55.434
Isn't that illegal?

33:55.435 --> 33:57.536
Well, not if it's official
police business, it's not.

33:57.537 --> 33:59.571
Oh, so that's what this is?

33:59.572 --> 34:01.940
Well, if anybody asks,
it is.

34:02.842 --> 34:04.643
So are you lost?

34:04.644 --> 34:08.480
No, I just came into town
to pick up a few things.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.081
How's your momma doing?

34:11.583 --> 34:12.918
She's all right.
- Yeah?

34:12.918 --> 34:15.353
She's resting.
- Hm.

34:15.355 --> 34:17.822
So, uh,

34:17.824 --> 34:19.358
I was gonna run over to Altus

34:19.359 --> 34:21.627
and catch a movie
tomorrow night.

34:21.628 --> 34:22.828
By yourself?

34:22.829 --> 34:24.362
Well, if you're not going.

34:26.366 --> 34:28.734
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.
- Yeah?

34:28.735 --> 34:31.036
All right. So I'll pick you up
at Buck's house?

34:31.036 --> 34:33.839
Why don't I come by your place?
- Okay.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.674
How about 6:00ish?

34:35.675 --> 34:37.275
How about 6:00?

34:37.277 --> 34:38.510
How about I'll be there?

34:38.511 --> 34:39.844
Uh-huh.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.915
Mm-mm.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.784
Now, let me get a little
of you walking home.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.022
Damn. Mm-mm.

34:58.064 --> 35:00.432
Sure is nice out
here tonight, ain't it?

35:00.433 --> 35:03.335
Well, that's all it is.
I gotta piss.

35:03.336 --> 35:05.738
I knew we should've gone down
to the river.

35:05.739 --> 35:08.040
There ain't a pig out here.
- How would you know?

35:08.041 --> 35:10.876
Rack, I've hunted pigs
my whole life.

35:10.877 --> 35:13.779
I've probably killed more pigs
than any man in Greer County.

35:13.780 --> 35:17.149
Is that so?
- It's primal instincts.

35:17.150 --> 35:19.885
I know how they eat.
I know how they sleep.

35:19.886 --> 35:21.420
I know
their breeding habits.

35:21.421 --> 35:23.589
I can talk to them
if I need to. Heh-heh!

35:23.590 --> 35:25.824
You can talk to pigs?
- Yup.

35:25.825 --> 35:28.127
Lonnie,
you're full of pig shit.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.462
Say what you want, Rack,

35:30.463 --> 35:33.866
but I am a pig's
worst nightmare.

35:33.867 --> 35:37.102
The last thing
a pig wants to see coming

35:37.103 --> 35:39.872
is Lonnie Luther Freeman.
- Luther?

35:39.873 --> 35:42.541
Yeah.
- That's your middle name? Luther?

35:42.542 --> 35:43.842
Be careful.

35:43.843 --> 35:45.144
You know what I did
to the last guy

35:45.145 --> 35:46.645
that made fun
of my middle name?

35:46.646 --> 35:47.746
What's that?

35:47.747 --> 35:51.116
Not a whole lot.
He's about 6'4", 250.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.425
You know, we could always drive
over to the Thirsty Monkey.

35:59.426 --> 36:01.193
There's a lot of pigs
over there.

36:01.194 --> 36:04.897
No, Rack. You know,
I'm done chasing women.

36:04.898 --> 36:07.666
I got Becky, and I'm happy.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.234
She don't complain about me,

36:09.235 --> 36:11.503
and she don't mind me
complaining about her.

36:15.775 --> 36:17.876
You-all ever think about
getting married?

36:17.877 --> 36:20.245
Oh, she does,
all the time.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.747
You know,
I'm just afraid if we did

36:21.748 --> 36:24.550
she wouldn't be as inclined
to take as good care of herself

36:24.551 --> 36:26.085
as she does now,
you know?

36:26.086 --> 36:27.586
I mean, hell,
you've seen her sister.

36:27.587 --> 36:29.355
Ugh.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.223
You gotta be at the table early
at Thanksgiving

36:31.224 --> 36:32.658
when she's around.

36:32.659 --> 36:34.493
My Lord.

36:34.494 --> 36:36.295
She did kinda swell up,
didn't she?

36:36.296 --> 36:38.130
Oh, like a eight-legged
dog tick.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.635
Hey, did, uh,
Cammie ever come back?

36:43.636 --> 36:45.037
No, I don't think
she's coming back.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.805
I think she's gone for good.

36:46.806 --> 36:50.342
Aw. Oh, man. I'm sorry
to hear about that.

36:50.343 --> 36:52.311
Guess who is back in town.
- Who?

36:52.312 --> 36:54.246
Annie Streets.
- My God,

36:54.247 --> 36:56.448
she was hotter than donut grease
back in high school.

36:56.449 --> 36:58.050
She still is.

36:58.051 --> 36:59.852
And I got a date with her
tomorrow night.

36:59.853 --> 37:01.286
You dog.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.988
You dog.

37:02.989 --> 37:04.590
Well, if you're
gonna keep her this time,

37:04.591 --> 37:07.159
maybe you oughta try doing
something a little different.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.329
I'm gonna suggest
not being yourself.

37:10.330 --> 37:13.098
I do need to get my shit
together.

37:13.099 --> 37:14.333
You?

37:14.334 --> 37:15.968
Yeah.
- Huh. Heh-heh!

37:15.969 --> 37:17.369
You want a beer?

37:18.838 --> 37:21.507
If you're not gonna talk to me,
Rack, just take me home.

37:33.186 --> 37:35.854
What?

37:35.855 --> 37:37.790
I had a nice time tonight.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.626
Well, the night ain't over yet.
Let's go for a walk.

37:40.627 --> 37:43.128
Oh, I don't know,
the streets of Altus, Oklahoma

37:43.129 --> 37:45.364
could be pretty dangerous
this time of night.

37:45.365 --> 37:47.333
I'll take my chances.

37:50.170 --> 37:51.737
Rack?

37:51.738 --> 37:53.172
What?

37:54.307 --> 37:56.175
Oh, I just wanted
to apologize

37:56.176 --> 37:58.477
for what Buck said to you
the other day

37:58.478 --> 38:00.713
and disrespecting your daddy
like that.

38:00.714 --> 38:01.914
Don't worry about that.

38:01.915 --> 38:04.783
That stepdaddy of yours
is a piece of work.

38:04.784 --> 38:06.385
What'd your momma
ever see in him anyway?

38:06.386 --> 38:07.753
Heh! I don't know.

38:07.754 --> 38:10.222
But I think at the beginning,
she really did love him.

38:10.223 --> 38:11.623
Then it became more about
security

38:11.624 --> 38:13.659
and making sure
I was taken care of.

38:13.660 --> 38:16.729
God bless her.
How do you put up with him?

38:16.730 --> 38:18.163
It's not easy.

38:18.164 --> 38:21.266
If Momma didn't live there,
I wouldn't need him.

38:21.267 --> 38:22.701
So who's gonna take care
of your momma

38:22.702 --> 38:24.837
when you go back to Chicago?

38:26.873 --> 38:29.575
Well, I'm not sure
I'm going back.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.478
What do you mean?

38:32.479 --> 38:34.780
Momma needs me,

38:34.781 --> 38:36.949
and I miss small-town life,
Rack.

38:36.950 --> 38:39.918
The big city's
too fast for me.

38:39.919 --> 38:42.421
I miss the people here.
I miss the pace.

38:42.422 --> 38:45.591
Heck, I even miss
the Tasty Cream.

38:47.127 --> 38:49.495
Believe it or not,

38:49.496 --> 38:52.598
I kinda missed you too.

38:52.599 --> 38:54.800
I missed you too, Annie.

38:57.537 --> 39:00.906
I-I got you something.
Heh-heh!

39:00.907 --> 39:02.875
Yeah, um...

39:02.876 --> 39:04.143
Here. Heh.

39:04.144 --> 39:05.944
Where did you get that?

39:05.945 --> 39:07.746
Dug it out of
an old box yesterday.

39:07.747 --> 39:10.382
Your daddy took it.
I thought you might want it.

39:10.383 --> 39:12.651
Remember our first date?
Your old truck broke down,

39:12.652 --> 39:14.787
and we had to walk
all that way back in the rain.

39:14.788 --> 39:18.290
Wow. Thanks, Annie.
Golly, we were soaked.

39:18.291 --> 39:20.459
I never thanked you
for wearing that white T-shirt.

39:22.529 --> 39:24.663
Those were good times, Rack.

39:24.664 --> 39:26.965
Yes, they were.
- Yeah.

39:45.652 --> 39:47.953
Wow.

39:47.954 --> 39:49.488
You've been practicing.

39:49.489 --> 39:52.091
Well, you've been gone
a long time.

39:52.092 --> 39:54.059
Well, we should do this again.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.729
Well,
the night ain't over yet.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.597
Well,
what do you wanna do?

39:58.598 --> 40:00.399
I don't know, maybe we'd...

40:00.400 --> 40:03.669
go get a corn dog
and go to my house?

40:03.670 --> 40:06.572
Oh, Rack, you're so romantic.

40:06.573 --> 40:08.540
Corn dog?

41:30.323 --> 41:31.523
Well, I think I got her

41:31.524 --> 41:33.258
fertilizing for you there--

41:33.259 --> 41:34.560
There, Rack.

41:34.561 --> 41:37.396
I appreciate you getting here
on such short notice, Bob.

41:37.397 --> 41:38.731
Ah, short notice,
long notice,

41:38.732 --> 41:40.265
it don't make
no difference to me.

41:40.266 --> 41:41.533
I ain't been--
I ain't been--

41:41.534 --> 41:43.702
I ain't been
too busy today, anyhow.

41:43.703 --> 41:46.305
Well, I tell you. You plumbers
sure are lifesavers.

41:46.306 --> 41:47.573
Well, I'll tell you what,

41:47.574 --> 41:49.174
I appreciate that,
but you know what?

41:49.175 --> 41:52.444
This job,
it ain't, uh, what it's, uh--

41:52.445 --> 41:54.013
It's cracked up to be.
- Must be hard.

41:54.014 --> 41:55.514
Bet it is.
There are three things--

41:55.515 --> 42:00.753
There is, uh--
Three things to, uh--

42:00.754 --> 42:03.622
There are three things
to be a plumber.

42:03.623 --> 42:05.090
I'm talking about
a good plumber.

42:05.091 --> 42:06.392
What's that?

42:06.393 --> 42:08.694
Shit runs downhill.

42:08.695 --> 42:10.696
Don't chew your fingernails.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.631
And payday is on Friday.

42:12.632 --> 42:13.999
I believe that.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.934
Hey, I'll see around. All right.
- Okay, Rack.

42:15.935 --> 42:17.436
Toodles.
- Hello?

42:24.544 --> 42:27.146
Buck Baker called the sheriff
early this morning.

42:27.147 --> 42:28.280
He was all upset.

42:28.281 --> 42:29.682
Annie didn't come home.

42:29.683 --> 42:32.851
We found her car out here,
abandoned.

42:36.623 --> 42:38.257
The car is clean, Rack.

42:38.258 --> 42:39.858
The keys
still in the ignition.

42:39.859 --> 42:42.394
The purse is there
with nothing missing.

42:42.395 --> 42:44.496
Wasn't a robbery.

42:44.497 --> 42:46.799
We don't have
any witnesses.

43:01.614 --> 43:02.681
Hey, Buck.

43:02.682 --> 43:04.383
Levins,
what are you doing here?

43:04.384 --> 43:07.553
Just checking up on Buck,
seeing how he's doing.

43:07.554 --> 43:10.022
Can I talk to him?
- Come on in.

43:11.624 --> 43:13.025
Rack.

43:13.026 --> 43:15.127
Buck, what can you tell me
about Annie?

43:15.128 --> 43:17.029
Well, she left about 6:00
yesterday evening.

43:17.030 --> 43:18.997
I haven't seen her since.

43:18.998 --> 43:20.065
You guys heard anything?

43:20.066 --> 43:21.800
Where she was last night?
What she did?

43:21.801 --> 43:22.801
Well, she was with me

43:22.802 --> 43:24.536
last night.
- She was with you?

43:24.537 --> 43:25.637
Yeah, we went over

43:25.638 --> 43:27.106
to Altus
and saw a movie.

43:27.107 --> 43:29.875
Well, where did she go
after the movie?

43:29.876 --> 43:32.745
Buck, she stayed the night
at my house

43:32.746 --> 43:34.980
and got up sometime
early this morning and left.

43:34.981 --> 43:36.849
You were the last one with her.
- Yeah.

43:36.850 --> 43:38.050
You'd think

43:38.051 --> 43:39.752
if your daughter's
screwing a cop,

43:39.753 --> 43:41.020
at least she'd be safe.

43:41.021 --> 43:42.488
You watch your mouth, Buck.

43:42.489 --> 43:45.024
Rack, you gotta understand
this don't look so good.

43:45.025 --> 43:47.326
You were the last one to see her

43:47.327 --> 43:48.894
before she disappeared.

43:48.895 --> 43:49.895
You ain't sayin'--
- No.

43:49.896 --> 43:51.830
Maybe you shouldn't be
on this case.

43:51.831 --> 43:53.732
I came over here 'cause I'm
lookin' for Annie.

43:53.733 --> 43:56.168
I think you've done enough,
Rack, don't you?

43:56.169 --> 43:58.003
Buck, I'll talk
with the sheriff.

43:58.004 --> 44:00.806
We'll find Annie.

44:00.807 --> 44:01.874
I think it's time

44:01.875 --> 44:04.943
for you to leave.

44:04.944 --> 44:07.246
Jesus Christ.

44:09.449 --> 44:10.916
You don't think
I did this, do you?

44:10.917 --> 44:14.053
Oh, hell no. Levins called.
He thinks it's a problem.

44:14.054 --> 44:15.454
You're not taking me off this.

44:15.455 --> 44:16.955
It's about Annie.
- I understand that.

44:16.956 --> 44:18.157
We'll keep you in the loop.

44:18.158 --> 44:19.425
But you cannot be seen
out there

44:19.426 --> 44:20.759
working on this case.

44:20.760 --> 44:24.997
You understand that?
We'll find her, all right?

44:24.998 --> 44:26.131
Johnny Franks.

44:26.132 --> 44:28.067
<i>He's clean, sheriff.</i>

44:28.068 --> 44:30.302
<i>He was at the Main Street Cafe</i>
<i>all morning.</i>

44:30.303 --> 44:32.938
<i>Talked to Barb and a few locals</i>
<i>who were there.</i>

44:32.939 --> 44:35.140
His story checks out.
- Sheriff?

44:35.141 --> 44:37.943
This sounds important.
You better punch up Line 2.

44:43.283 --> 44:45.150
Sheriff Landry.

44:45.151 --> 44:48.053
<i>Bring my brother</i>
<i>to the center of Market Square</i>

44:48.054 --> 44:50.255
in Santa Luna, Mexico.

44:50.256 --> 44:52.224
Sundown, this Friday.

44:52.225 --> 44:53.325
Once my brother is released,

44:53.326 --> 44:55.060
<i>you'll get the girl.</i>

44:55.061 --> 44:57.529
<i>At one minute later,</i>
<i>if I don't see my brother,</i>

44:57.530 --> 45:00.733
I'll assume
you want me to kill her.

45:00.734 --> 45:03.168
And I will.

45:03.169 --> 45:05.104
<i>Do you understand?</i>

45:05.105 --> 45:08.007
Yeah, I understand.

45:08.008 --> 45:10.209
How do I contact you till then?

45:11.745 --> 45:12.945
Oh, shit.

45:14.314 --> 45:16.548
Wait, wait, wait.
Rack. Hold on, Rack.

45:16.549 --> 45:17.649
Hold him. Hold him.

45:17.650 --> 45:20.185
Hold up. Stop.

45:20.186 --> 45:21.820
Where do you think you're going?
- Mexico.

45:21.821 --> 45:22.955
You're not going to Mexico.

45:22.956 --> 45:26.091
This is no
small-town thug here.

45:26.092 --> 45:27.092
This is bigger than us.

45:27.093 --> 45:28.327
They got Annie.

45:28.328 --> 45:29.862
Hey, I don't care
about that right now.

45:29.863 --> 45:31.163
You listen to me.

45:31.164 --> 45:33.032
They could have Annie
right here in this county,

45:33.033 --> 45:37.169
and you wanna go down to Mexico
and do something stupid.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.640
You with me on this?

45:43.576 --> 45:44.610
Yeah.

45:44.611 --> 45:46.078
We'll let you know.

45:46.079 --> 45:49.148
You take the afternoon off.
Cool down.

45:50.116 --> 45:53.986
<i># I need to see your face #</i>

45:53.987 --> 45:57.923
<i># Baby, I drove by your place #</i>

45:57.924 --> 46:00.893
<i># But you're still not there #</i>

46:00.894 --> 46:04.163
<i># I can't find you anywhere #</i>

46:04.164 --> 46:07.933
<i># One night was not enough #</i>

46:07.934 --> 46:12.371
<i># You've got this boy</i>
<i>Crazy in love #</i>

46:12.372 --> 46:14.707
<i># And if I'm right #</i>

46:14.708 --> 46:17.910
<i># Yeah, baby, if I'm right #</i>

46:17.911 --> 46:23.549
<i># You might need a hero</i>
<i>Tonight #</i>

46:36.129 --> 46:37.730
Lonnie.

46:37.731 --> 46:39.398
Lonnie, there's someone
at the door.

46:39.399 --> 46:40.432
Ah. Tell 'em we're not here.

46:40.433 --> 46:41.734
Lonnie, get up.
- Wake up.

46:41.735 --> 46:42.868
Get up.

46:42.869 --> 46:45.738
Damn it, Becky.
- Go answer the door.

46:45.739 --> 46:49.408
It's 3 in the morning.
Who's at the door?

46:50.543 --> 46:52.411
I'm comin'.

46:57.450 --> 46:59.151
Hold on.

47:00.387 --> 47:02.521
Rack?
- Lonnie, let's go.

47:02.522 --> 47:04.656
Go where?
Mexico. I'm gonna go get Annie.

47:04.657 --> 47:06.825
You're not supposed
to be workin' on this case.

47:06.826 --> 47:08.127
Sheriff said.
- You'll need that.

47:08.128 --> 47:09.795
Where's your ammo?
- Bottom drawer.

47:09.796 --> 47:11.864
This is not a good idea.
I'm tellin' you right now.

47:11.865 --> 47:13.599
You gotta think about
what you're doing.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.234
Annie's down in Mexico,
scared to death.

47:15.235 --> 47:18.037
I'm not gonna wait on Landry
to come up with a bullshit plan.

47:18.038 --> 47:19.505
Where's the keys to Thunder?

47:19.506 --> 47:22.908
No. We're not taking my truck.
She's not even broke in yet.

47:22.909 --> 47:23.909
Lonnie?

47:23.910 --> 47:25.811
What's going on?
- Hey, Beck.

47:25.812 --> 47:27.179
Lonnie, let's go.

47:27.180 --> 47:29.481
Honey, wait right here.
I'll be right back. I promise.

47:29.482 --> 47:32.384
Rack, why do we gotta
take my truck?

47:34.587 --> 47:37.022
You gonna wear those
to Mexico?

47:37.023 --> 47:38.557
Um. Ahem.

47:38.558 --> 47:42.327
Becky got these for me
for Valentime's Day.

47:42.328 --> 47:44.363
They come with
a matching tank top.

47:44.364 --> 47:46.265
It just looks too ridiculous.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.335
Well, they're real nice.

47:51.771 --> 47:54.006
Let me get my stuff.

48:08.555 --> 48:11.223
Oh, no. You're not bringing
that stupid mutt with us.

48:11.224 --> 48:14.059
Police dog.

48:14.060 --> 48:15.561
I don't believe this.

48:15.562 --> 48:19.798
Oh, Jesus, Skunk!
You scared the shit out of me.

48:19.799 --> 48:21.333
Morning, Skunk.

48:21.334 --> 48:23.602
Dead man. That's what I am.

48:23.603 --> 48:26.739
If you two and that Mexican
don't kill me, Becky will.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.540
So did you get everything?
- Yeah.

48:28.541 --> 48:30.209
Why do we gotta
take my truck, anyway?

48:30.210 --> 48:31.944
'Cause they won't be
looking for your truck.

48:31.945 --> 48:34.813
What are we doing?
- First, we're gonna go get Tito.

48:34.814 --> 48:36.148
Great. How we gonna
pull that off?

48:36.149 --> 48:37.750
Well, who's working
the graveyard shift

48:37.751 --> 48:39.084
down at the jail tonight?

48:39.085 --> 48:40.486
Peabody. So what?

48:40.487 --> 48:41.553
So, what happens to Peabody

48:41.554 --> 48:43.689
when he eats too much sugar?

48:43.690 --> 48:45.257
He gets sleepy.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.801
Four bear claws.
- Yeah.

48:55.802 --> 48:58.504
Four éclairs,
couple of them cinnamon rolls--

48:58.505 --> 48:59.505
Can I get

48:59.506 --> 49:00.973
two of those chocolatey,
twisty deals

49:00.974 --> 49:02.241
with the sprinkles on top?

49:02.242 --> 49:04.076
I love those. Heh.

49:04.077 --> 49:05.611
Skunk, you--? You want anything?

49:07.847 --> 49:09.982
What? I'm hungry.

49:12.118 --> 49:13.952
Now, what was that
you said you wanted?

49:17.691 --> 49:19.425
Hey, Peabody.
- Oh, hey.

49:19.426 --> 49:22.094
Hey, Lonnie.

49:22.095 --> 49:23.762
What are you doin'
down here this late?

49:23.763 --> 49:25.731
Oh, I was just
in the neighborhood,

49:25.732 --> 49:27.700
and I thought I'd come by
and bring you some donuts,

49:27.701 --> 49:29.368
you know, since it's
your birthday and all.

49:29.369 --> 49:31.203
It ain't my birthday.

49:31.204 --> 49:32.938
Well, then Merry Christmas.

49:32.939 --> 49:34.406
Well, it's March.
- Hell, Peabody.

49:34.407 --> 49:36.842
I brought you donuts. Can't
a fella bring a friend donuts?

49:36.843 --> 49:37.976
Okay, all right.

49:37.977 --> 49:40.212
All right.

49:42.048 --> 49:43.282
Well...

49:43.283 --> 49:44.883
Well? Well, what?

49:44.884 --> 49:46.452
I don't really care much
for bear claws.

49:46.453 --> 49:48.954
Hey, do you have any of them
chocolatey, twisty deals

49:48.955 --> 49:50.823
with the sprinkles on top?

49:50.824 --> 49:52.224
I really love those.

49:59.366 --> 50:00.366
Is he asleep?

50:00.367 --> 50:01.934
Like a big fat baby.

50:08.475 --> 50:09.475
Wake up.

50:09.476 --> 50:13.078
Get your ugly ass up.
Let's go.

50:14.114 --> 50:15.114
Where are we going?

50:15.115 --> 50:16.815
Mexico.

50:34.601 --> 50:36.535
Come on, Junior.

50:36.536 --> 50:39.104
There you go, buddy.
There you go.

50:39.105 --> 50:40.606
Hey, Lonnie.
- Yeah?

50:40.607 --> 50:42.741
Get that windshield. I'm gonna
go and pay for this fuel.

50:42.742 --> 50:43.742
Okay.

50:43.743 --> 50:45.744
Do you want a coffee,
Skunk?

50:59.959 --> 51:03.028
Hi, handsome.

51:03.029 --> 51:04.897
Me?

51:04.898 --> 51:06.532
You like to have
a good time?

51:07.801 --> 51:08.801
Yeah. Heh.

51:08.802 --> 51:10.536
I'm Harveyetta.

51:10.537 --> 51:11.870
I'm Lonnie. Heh.

51:11.871 --> 51:13.439
Who's that dude
in the back seat, huh?

51:14.974 --> 51:16.008
Oh, that's my prisoner.

51:17.477 --> 51:19.144
I'll be your prisoner.

51:19.145 --> 51:20.579
Well,
he's a real prisoner.

51:20.580 --> 51:23.115
He's Tito Garza.
He's Manny Garza's brother.

51:23.116 --> 51:26.018
He's wanted by the FBI.
He's a big drug-warhead fella.

51:26.019 --> 51:28.187
He kidnapped Rack's girlfriend.
Now he's in the store.

51:28.188 --> 51:30.322
They're not like boyfriend
or girlfriend or anything.

51:30.323 --> 51:32.591
They, uh-- Uh, we got
till sundown Friday.

51:32.592 --> 51:34.693
We're gonna trade him for Annie.
She lives in Chicago.

51:34.694 --> 51:36.061
Oh. Ha-ha.

51:36.062 --> 51:38.330
Well, that's so...

51:38.331 --> 51:39.631
hot.

51:45.105 --> 51:47.139
So that's, uh,
two coffees and, uh...

51:48.174 --> 51:49.608
Freeze, Snow White!

51:49.609 --> 51:52.711
This is a hold up.
Give me the cash.

51:52.712 --> 51:54.046
What are you looking at,
pilgrim?

51:54.047 --> 51:56.048
Ease up there, Casper.

51:56.049 --> 51:58.350
All right now, nobody moves and
nobody gets hurt, all right?

51:59.786 --> 52:00.819
Now, you open that register

52:00.820 --> 52:02.554
and you give me
the money right now.

52:02.555 --> 52:05.457
Don't give him jack.
We got two coffees--

52:05.458 --> 52:06.525
You wanna get shot?

52:06.526 --> 52:07.893
How are you gonna shoot me?

52:07.894 --> 52:09.094
You got your safety on?

52:14.100 --> 52:15.467
Sorry about that.

52:15.468 --> 52:17.102
Throw that away before somebody
gets hurt.

52:17.103 --> 52:18.871
Um,

52:18.872 --> 52:20.239
it's--

52:20.240 --> 52:21.940
That's, uh--

52:21.941 --> 52:23.876
That's $75 even.

52:23.877 --> 52:25.778
Heh. I'll be damned.

52:25.779 --> 52:28.113
Two coffees
and a fill-up, 75 even.

52:28.114 --> 52:29.748
What are the chances
of that happening?

52:31.918 --> 52:34.086
I wonder if a sweet little
old girl like me

52:34.087 --> 52:35.988
could hitch a ride
to the next truck stop

52:35.989 --> 52:39.258
with a big, strong lawman
like you?

52:39.259 --> 52:41.894
Well, I reckon we could. I--

52:41.895 --> 52:43.228
I mean, I'm gonna
need to ask Rack.

52:43.229 --> 52:44.496
Nope.

52:44.497 --> 52:47.399
Hey, Rack. Hey, listen, uh,
this is Harveyetta.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.702
She was, uh-- She was wantin' to
know if she could catch a ride

52:49.703 --> 52:50.903
to the next truck stop.

52:50.904 --> 52:53.005
Let the hooker go
and get in the truck.

52:53.006 --> 52:55.074
Hooker?
Rack, she ain't a hooker. Heh.

52:55.075 --> 52:56.208
She's a good Christian woman.

52:56.209 --> 52:58.243
She's got
a nice cross necklace on.

53:00.647 --> 53:03.615
I told you that was
a nice rack necklace.

53:03.616 --> 53:06.385
I mean, a nice, you know.

53:06.386 --> 53:08.854
By God, I believe you're right,
Lonnie.

53:08.855 --> 53:10.556
She is a good Christian woman.

53:10.557 --> 53:11.924
Mm-hm.
- But she's not goin'.

53:11.925 --> 53:13.325
Now get in the truck.

53:13.326 --> 53:14.360
Rack.

53:14.361 --> 53:15.761
Well, but--

53:15.762 --> 53:17.096
Sorry, Harveyetta.

53:17.097 --> 53:18.230
Hey, where's Tito?

53:19.532 --> 53:22.001
He was in the back seat.
He-- He couldn't have--

53:22.002 --> 53:23.836
Damn it, Lonnie.
I told you to watch him.

53:28.174 --> 53:30.009
You goin' fishin', Tito?

53:36.216 --> 53:38.050
Hurts like hell, don't it?

53:38.051 --> 53:40.886
You got him?
Get him in there.

53:46.359 --> 53:47.359
Tito.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.828
What?
- Come here.

53:49.829 --> 53:51.330
You try that crap again,

53:51.331 --> 53:52.965
I'm gonna duct tape
your ass to the bumper.

53:59.439 --> 54:01.040
Oh, my Lord.

54:08.014 --> 54:09.314
This better be good.

54:09.315 --> 54:11.483
<i>Sheriff, he's gone.</i>

54:11.484 --> 54:13.819
<i>Yeah, I don't know where</i>
<i>they went.</i>

54:15.221 --> 54:19.391
<i>#</i> Love Talk <i>with Lea #</i>

54:19.392 --> 54:21.727
<i>You are listening to</i>
Love Talk <i>with Lea.</i>

54:21.728 --> 54:25.064
<i>We are mending hearts</i>
<i>from coast to coast tonight.</i>

54:25.065 --> 54:27.533
<i>Our first caller</i>
<i>is from Levelland, Texas.</i>

54:27.534 --> 54:28.867
<i>His name is Danny.</i>

54:28.868 --> 54:31.036
<i>Hi, Danny.</i>
<i>Who you loving tonight?</i>

54:31.037 --> 54:33.839
<i>Well, I'm loving</i>
<i>my beautiful wife, Debbie, Lea.</i>

54:33.840 --> 54:35.741
<i>Well, tell us all
about Debbie, Danny.</i>

54:35.742 --> 54:38.010
<i>Well, we've been
married for 17 years, Lea,</i>

54:38.011 --> 54:40.312
<i>and there were times</i>
<i>when I doubted our love</i>

54:40.313 --> 54:41.814
<i>and I took her for granted,</i>

54:41.815 --> 54:44.616
<i>till three years ago when I had</i>
<i>the accident on the farm.</i>

54:44.617 --> 54:47.653
<i>I woke up in the hospital</i>
<i>and both my arms were gone.</i>

54:47.654 --> 54:49.755
<i>The first thing I thought</i>
<i>that went through my head</i>

54:49.756 --> 54:53.025
<i>was I'd never be able</i>
<i>to hug my wife again.</i>

54:53.026 --> 54:55.127
<i>And the second thought was</i>
<i>how was I gonna play catch</i>

54:55.128 --> 54:56.995
<i>with my little boy.</i>

54:56.996 --> 54:59.665
<i>And the third thought that was</i>
<i>probably the most devastating</i>

54:59.666 --> 55:03.669
<i>was how would I defend myself</i>
<i>if someone was tickling me.</i>

55:05.105 --> 55:06.372
Can I come in?

55:06.373 --> 55:08.540
I'm freezing my tits off
out here.

55:08.541 --> 55:09.608
The hell is she doin' here?

55:09.609 --> 55:11.143
Hey, Harveyetta.

55:12.412 --> 55:15.280
Just had enough of that
damn hooker, didn't you?

55:15.281 --> 55:17.916
See what you did?
This is all on you.

55:17.917 --> 55:19.184
Hey, Harveyetta.
- Howdy.

55:19.185 --> 55:20.819
Now you march yourself
right around there

55:20.820 --> 55:23.922
and you drive a little while.

55:23.923 --> 55:25.858
Well, come on. Let's roll.

55:25.859 --> 55:28.193
And you, young lady, you're
getting off the next truck stop.

55:28.194 --> 55:29.695
You understand me?

55:44.210 --> 55:45.778
I've brought you some food,
my dear.

55:45.779 --> 55:47.312
I wouldn't want
your boyfriend to think

55:47.313 --> 55:49.882
I wasn't taking care of you.

55:54.554 --> 55:57.256
I don't like
being insulted.

55:59.993 --> 56:02.127
Your boyfriend insulted me.

56:02.128 --> 56:04.463
He took someone
that was very important to me.

56:04.464 --> 56:05.631
He took my brother.

56:07.133 --> 56:09.268
Let me show you something.

56:11.571 --> 56:12.571
Francisco.

56:18.411 --> 56:19.511
This is Pedro.

56:24.451 --> 56:26.352
Pedro,

56:26.353 --> 56:29.188
you took something from me,
didn't you?

56:29.189 --> 56:31.924
Manuel, please.

56:31.925 --> 56:33.325
Tell her what you took.

56:33.326 --> 56:34.793
No, I swear, I took nothing.

56:34.794 --> 56:36.562
That's not true, Pedro.

56:36.563 --> 56:38.831
I gave you a package to deliver.

56:38.832 --> 56:40.599
You were supposed to get money
for the package

56:40.600 --> 56:41.767
and bring it back to me.

56:41.768 --> 56:43.168
But you kept the money
for yourself.

56:43.169 --> 56:46.038
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Manuel.

56:46.039 --> 56:47.806
It's okay.

56:47.807 --> 56:49.742
It's okay.

56:51.778 --> 56:54.213
It's okay, <i>perdido.</i>

57:05.925 --> 57:08.794
I don't like it when people
takes things from me.

57:11.531 --> 57:12.765
<i>Idiota.</i>

57:12.766 --> 57:15.167
He's bleeding all over the rug!

57:16.803 --> 57:20.773
Annie, good help
is so hard to find these days.

57:29.883 --> 57:33.519
What is that God-awful smell?

57:33.520 --> 57:35.988
Oh, that's Junior.
Something big's about to happen.

57:35.989 --> 57:37.022
Who's Junior?

57:37.023 --> 57:38.490
He's my police dog back there.

57:44.397 --> 57:45.964
Hey, baby.

57:48.401 --> 57:49.902
Follow us.
<i># Show them to me #</i>

57:49.903 --> 57:52.538
<i># Show them to me #</i>

57:52.539 --> 57:55.374
I love you.

57:55.375 --> 57:59.845
<i># Unclasp your bra</i>
<i>Set those puppies free #</i>

57:59.846 --> 58:01.080
<i># They'd look</i>
<i>A whole lot better #</i>

58:01.081 --> 58:02.381
<i># Without that sweater #</i>

58:02.382 --> 58:05.918
<i># Baby, I'm sure you'll agree #</i>

58:05.919 --> 58:09.321
<i># If you got two fun bags # </i>

58:09.322 --> 58:11.123
<i># Show them to me #</i>

58:18.498 --> 58:20.766
Well, it can't be that hard
to find them.

58:20.767 --> 58:25.571
Now, I gotta have Tito Gaza
in Oklahoma City on Saturday

58:25.572 --> 58:27.206
or it is someone's ass.

58:27.207 --> 58:29.508
Now you find them, damn it.

58:30.343 --> 58:32.144
Jeez.

58:37.217 --> 58:39.151
Well, this is
just great, Rack.

58:39.152 --> 58:40.552
What took me
two years to rebuild,

58:40.553 --> 58:42.121
took us one day
to screw up.

58:42.122 --> 58:43.922
Took you one hour
to screw it up.

58:43.923 --> 58:45.958
I knew we shouldn't have taken
my truck. I knew it.

58:45.959 --> 58:48.260
Well, you brought us out here
now, and got us in trouble.

58:48.261 --> 58:49.962
A busted radiator
in the middle of nowhere.

58:50.997 --> 58:52.531
Uh, fellas.

58:54.701 --> 58:56.568
Heh. Will somebody
get the Mexican?

58:58.838 --> 59:00.806
I said get him.
Don't kill him.

59:13.053 --> 59:15.421
Look like
somebody's comin' up.

59:15.422 --> 59:18.157
Let's see if we
can get him to help.

59:24.064 --> 59:25.330
Y'all need any help?

59:25.331 --> 59:26.331
Yeah, man.

59:26.332 --> 59:27.666
Where's the closest gas station?

59:27.667 --> 59:29.868
About 75 miles, I think.

59:29.869 --> 59:31.236
Damn.

59:31.237 --> 59:33.005
I'll push you all down there
about 30 minutes.

59:33.006 --> 59:35.541
I got a campsite.
Got a good mechanic down there.

59:35.542 --> 59:38.243
I appreciate that, old-timer.
We're in a hell of a hurry.

59:53.827 --> 59:55.561
Damn.

59:56.563 --> 59:59.598
So, uh, this girlfriend
of yours,

59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.100
she means a lot you, huh?

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.802
Who told you
I got a girlfriend?

01:00:03.803 --> 01:00:05.404
Lonnie, you got a big mouth.

01:00:05.405 --> 01:00:06.705
Aw.
- Sorry.

01:00:06.706 --> 01:00:09.174
It's like a romantic fairy tale.

01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.209
Rack, the white knight,

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.144
sweeping in to save
the princess.

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:14.880
What do you know about
white knights and fairy tales

01:00:14.881 --> 01:00:16.348
in your line of work?

01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:20.519
Well, I-I reckon I made plenty
of fantasies come true.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.355
Yeah. Had your hand in a lot
of happy endings, huh?

01:00:23.356 --> 01:00:25.724
I wrote me a poem down.

01:00:25.725 --> 01:00:28.927
Now, if I ever met
my fantasy guy--? Okay?

01:00:28.928 --> 01:00:30.829
--I'd want him to say
something like this:

01:00:32.332 --> 01:00:33.732
All right.

01:00:33.733 --> 01:00:38.470
<i>When the sun don't rise</i>
<i>and the wind don't blow</i>

01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:40.806
<i>And the seas have</i>
<i>left the shore</i>

01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:44.109
<i>I promise, my dearest</i>
<i>With my dying breath</i>

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.112
<i>To love you forevermore</i>

01:00:48.648 --> 01:00:52.051
A man ever says something like
that to me, he'd own my soul.

01:00:53.053 --> 01:00:54.586
Harveyetta,

01:00:54.587 --> 01:00:57.823
that is the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my life.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:59.925
Hey, a gal can dream, can't she?

01:00:59.926 --> 01:01:01.660
I come a long way
from Sweetwater

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:03.462
to find my white knight.

01:01:03.463 --> 01:01:06.265
Yeah, one truck stop at a time.

01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:11.236
You love this girl of yours?

01:01:11.237 --> 01:01:13.605
I've always loved her.

01:01:13.606 --> 01:01:15.774
You gonna marry her?

01:01:15.775 --> 01:01:17.843
Yeah, maybe someday.

01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:26.885
A boy can dream, can't he?

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.661
Here we are, folks.

01:02:09.662 --> 01:02:12.531
Yeah, it's right over there,
what I saw.

01:02:22.308 --> 01:02:23.575
Hey.

01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:25.010
I'm Charlie.

01:02:25.011 --> 01:02:27.413
What kind of horseshit
you got going on here, Charlie?

01:02:28.982 --> 01:02:30.783
This is like our down season,

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:32.284
you know,
we're traveling show folks.

01:02:32.285 --> 01:02:33.919
Why don't you fix that radiator

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.555
and show us how to travel
the hell out of here.

01:02:36.556 --> 01:02:38.323
This the rig you called
me about, Charlie?

01:02:38.324 --> 01:02:39.491
Hey, this is Jeff.

01:02:39.492 --> 01:02:41.827
He can fix any kind
of vehicle you got.

01:02:41.828 --> 01:02:43.629
Mm.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.064
Handsome and handy, huh?

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:47.633
That's what my wife says.

01:02:52.939 --> 01:02:55.240
Oh, look, a monkey.

01:02:55.241 --> 01:02:56.442
What do you think?

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:58.043
What's the chance
of getting it running?

01:02:58.044 --> 01:02:59.378
In a hell of a hurry.

01:02:59.379 --> 01:03:00.446
Hi.
- Well...

01:03:03.316 --> 01:03:06.318
You boys cops or something?

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:07.519
Yeah, Jeff. Come here, man.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.056
I need a little chat with you.

01:03:11.057 --> 01:03:13.792
I gotta get that guy back there
to Santa Luna, Mexico,

01:03:13.793 --> 01:03:15.027
like, pronto, or there's gonna

01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:18.230
be some really bad
stuff go down.

01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:19.598
So you think you can
get me running?

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.967
Yeah, man. I'll get you running
in about four, five hours.

01:03:21.968 --> 01:03:23.102
That's great.

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:25.771
The thing is,
we just need to find a radiator.

01:03:25.772 --> 01:03:28.574
But I guarantee there's
one here. Follow me.

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:40.252
You gotta be shitting me.

01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:46.592
She got a shot by a
security guard at the bank

01:03:46.593 --> 01:03:49.261
and she bled to death
in my arms.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:55.567
That is so...

01:03:56.703 --> 01:03:58.537
hot.

01:03:58.538 --> 01:04:02.574
Yeah. Yeah, you're my kind
of girl. All right.

01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:04.677
We wanna welcome
our new friends here.

01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:06.945
Is everybody sharing

01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:08.580
a cup of circus jolly?

01:04:08.581 --> 01:04:10.349
Jolly.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.750
We make kids laugh,

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:14.119
we make kids cry.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.755
That's what we'll do
till the day we die.

01:04:16.756 --> 01:04:19.892
If you love us,
you can fill your glasses,

01:04:19.893 --> 01:04:21.260
and if you don't,

01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:23.762
you can kiss our asses.
- Kiss our asses.

01:04:23.763 --> 01:04:25.531
Jolly.

01:04:30.103 --> 01:04:31.670
Rack, this stuff's pretty good.

01:04:31.671 --> 01:04:33.072
That's elephant piss.

01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:37.309
Just kidding.
Horse piss. Kidding.

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:39.845
Gene's Gypsy wine.

01:04:39.846 --> 01:04:42.781
You know our toasts around here
are kind of a family thing

01:04:42.782 --> 01:04:44.516
even though we're not kin.

01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:48.454
That's old Sniper Sam
over there from Vietnam.

01:04:48.455 --> 01:04:51.523
Been a carny for 35 years.
He's a sharpshooter.

01:04:53.326 --> 01:04:56.261
He was the best man
at both my weddings.

01:04:56.262 --> 01:04:58.797
And you remember
Two Ton Tina over there.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.034
Oh, she's friendly.
She's a hugger.

01:05:03.169 --> 01:05:04.903
Oh, Rack.

01:05:05.972 --> 01:05:08.340
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:10.476
direct your attention
to the center stage,

01:05:10.477 --> 01:05:13.979
where I,
Merriweather the Magnificent--

01:05:17.717 --> 01:05:21.186
--will attempt an amazing feat

01:05:21.187 --> 01:05:22.755
that I have been practicing
for months

01:05:22.756 --> 01:05:24.023
with piss-poor results.

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:32.197
In my quest to become the most
daring illusionist of our time,

01:05:32.198 --> 01:05:39.571
my bravery is matched
only by my blind stupidity.

01:05:44.744 --> 01:05:47.079
Ah.

01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:57.056
Isn't that dangerous, Charlie?

01:05:57.057 --> 01:06:01.660
Danger is often just an illusion
created in our minds.

01:06:01.661 --> 01:06:04.430
But when danger
becomes a reality,

01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:07.099
it must be met head-on.

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:11.904
With an illusion.

01:06:17.744 --> 01:06:19.511
All right, little fellow.

01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:24.950
What's wrong, Lonnie?

01:06:24.951 --> 01:06:26.618
Lost my watch.

01:06:26.619 --> 01:06:28.053
It's...

01:06:28.054 --> 01:06:31.223
twelve-thirty.

01:06:31.224 --> 01:06:33.192
That's my watch.

01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:34.193
He took my watch.

01:06:34.194 --> 01:06:35.461
Sit down, Lonnie.

01:06:35.462 --> 01:06:37.296
Give me my watch,
you shakey old son of a bitch.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:43.035
You saying I took your watch?

01:06:43.036 --> 01:06:44.737
No, Sam.

01:06:44.738 --> 01:06:49.508
I-I think I left my watch
at the truck stop.

01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:51.143
My mistake.

01:06:51.144 --> 01:06:53.579
Oh, it's no mistake, mister.

01:06:57.517 --> 01:06:59.618
Gotcha! Just kidding, pard.

01:07:16.202 --> 01:07:17.269
There you go, Rack.

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.071
You got her fixed?

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:20.873
Good as new.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:22.007
All right, man.

01:07:22.008 --> 01:07:25.477
You're the best.

01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:27.780
Jeff, we'll see you, buddy.
- See you.

01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:31.517
Hey, old Charlie boy
gave me a big old jug

01:07:31.518 --> 01:07:32.685
of the circus jolly last night.

01:07:32.686 --> 01:07:35.254
Yeah?
- I like it.

01:07:35.255 --> 01:07:37.322
Hey, wait. We forgot Harveyetta.

01:07:37.323 --> 01:07:39.558
No, your girlfriend's staying.

01:07:42.262 --> 01:07:44.830
Hooker.

01:07:51.338 --> 01:07:52.538
Sixty-two miles to showdown.

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:53.539
I can't wait that long.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.207
You gotta pull over.
I gotta pee.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:58.043
We just left 35 minutes ago.
You can't hold it?

01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:00.412
The circus jolly is running
right through me. Pull over.

01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:01.647
Jesus Christ, Lonnie.

01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:03.282
Use that cup.

01:08:03.283 --> 01:08:05.384
Look, I don't know about you,
but it takes two hands

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.518
to wrangle what I got.

01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:08.420
Would you like to hold
the cup for me?

01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:17.996
Oh. Ooh.

01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:21.867
Hey, fellas.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.908
Oh-h-h-h.

01:08:29.908 --> 01:08:31.477
Oh. Oh.

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:35.781
If this thing didn't have
a hole at the end of it,

01:08:35.782 --> 01:08:37.282
it'd look like
a football right now.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.926
They got great acoustics
in here, Rack.

01:08:52.698 --> 01:08:55.734
# You know you make me wanna-- #

01:08:58.004 --> 01:09:01.206
Cigarettes will kill you, man.

01:09:01.207 --> 01:09:03.908
# Now, wai-ai-ait a minute #

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:07.546
# Hm-hm #

01:09:07.546 --> 01:09:09.782
# You know you make me
Wanna shout #

01:09:09.783 --> 01:09:11.183
# Kick my heels up and shout #

01:09:11.184 --> 01:09:12.984

# Say that you-hoo-hoo #

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:33.839

# Say. Say #

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:57.763
# I want you to know #

01:09:57.764 --> 01:10:00.632
# I said I want you
To know right now #

01:10:00.633 --> 01:10:03.635
# You've been good to me, baby #

01:10:03.636 --> 01:10:07.940
# Better than I been to myself
Hey, hey #

01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:10.909
Come on, man.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.544
# A little bit softer now #
# Shout #

01:10:12.545 --> 01:10:14.146
# A little bit louder now #

# A little bit louder now #

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:16.882
# A little bit louder now #

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.987
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

01:10:21.988 --> 01:10:23.689
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.457
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:27.226
# Hey-yay-yay-yay #

# Hey-ey-ey-ey #

# Hey-yeah-yay-yay #
# Hey-yeah-yay-yay #

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:35.234
I really like it here, Rack.

01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:37.069
They got some really friendly
people down here.

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:40.039
Do you think we could come back
when we're not working?

01:10:48.148 --> 01:10:50.783
<i># Well, how did I</i>
<i>Wind up down here #</i>

01:10:50.784 --> 01:10:52.518
<i># In Mexico... #</i>

01:10:52.519 --> 01:10:56.822
Okay, guys, let's try to
be as inconspicuous as possible.

01:11:03.063 --> 01:11:04.763
La puerta: <i>The door.</i>

01:11:04.764 --> 01:11:06.532
<i>La puerta:</i> The door.

01:11:06.533 --> 01:11:08.534
Tengo gusto: <i>I like.</i>

01:11:08.535 --> 01:11:10.836
<i>Tengo gusto:</i> I like.

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:12.738
Queso: <i>Cheese.</i>

01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:15.040
<i>Queso:</i> Cheese.

01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:16.709
Taengo gusto del queso.

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:18.977
<i>I like cheese.</i>

01:11:18.978 --> 01:11:22.348
<i>Tengo gusto del queso.</i> Ha.

01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:25.317
How about that shit, Rack?
I like cheese.

01:11:25.318 --> 01:11:27.453
You know what I'd like?
I'd like for you to give me time

01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:28.587
to think here for a minute.

01:11:28.588 --> 01:11:29.888
You know what Rack?

01:11:29.889 --> 01:11:32.291
If we're gonna blend in,
we need to know these stuff.

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.526
I can't help it that you're
gonna be at a disadvantage

01:11:34.527 --> 01:11:35.961
because you don't know Spanish.

01:11:39.165 --> 01:11:40.265
Not right now, little buddy.

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:43.335
Hey, kid, do you speak English?

01:11:43.336 --> 01:11:45.137
<i>No comprenda.</i>

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:46.705
Are you sure you
don't speak English?

01:11:48.508 --> 01:11:51.410
A little.
- Yeah.

01:11:51.411 --> 01:11:52.945
What's your name?
- Chico.

01:11:52.946 --> 01:11:54.046
Chico, good.

01:11:54.047 --> 01:11:56.215
You know who this guy is?

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.554
No, señor.

01:12:02.555 --> 01:12:04.623
Manuel Garza.

01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:06.625
You know Manuel Garza?

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:10.396
<i>Si, señor. Gato Diablo.</i>
<i>No bueno.</i>

01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:12.364
Hey, you're telling me
"No bueno."

01:12:12.365 --> 01:12:13.866
You wanna make $50?

01:12:15.235 --> 01:12:16.568
<i>Si.</i>
- Yeah?

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:17.970
<i>Si, señor.</i>
- All right,

01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:19.471
You wait right here, okay?

01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:21.573
Lonnie, write your cell phone
number down on a paper.

01:12:21.574 --> 01:12:22.641
Oh, yeah, right.

01:12:22.642 --> 01:12:24.877
My truck, my piece of paper,

01:12:24.878 --> 01:12:26.445
my cell phone number.

01:12:26.446 --> 01:12:28.647
Give me that damn necklace.

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:31.617
Hey, Chico. Come here, bud.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:34.687
All right.

01:12:36.322 --> 01:12:39.825
You make sure Gato Diablo
gets this, okay?

01:12:39.826 --> 01:12:41.827
<i>Si, señor.</i>

01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:43.629
Señor.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:45.864
I hope many beautiful women
come to your funeral.

01:12:49.069 --> 01:12:50.536
Hey, Skunk, keep an eye on Tito.

01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:53.105
That kid's a really fast runner.
What are we gonna do?

01:12:53.106 --> 01:12:55.274
Let's go in this cantina
and wait on his call.

01:13:06.953 --> 01:13:08.087
Señor Gato, Señor Gato.

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:09.455
Stop that boy.

01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:21.433
Whoo!

01:13:21.434 --> 01:13:23.502
That is margarita.

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:27.039
I believe, that's the biggest
margarita I've ever drank.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.609
They do not mess around
in Mexico, I tell you what.

01:13:33.046 --> 01:13:35.314
You think he's gonna call?

01:13:35.315 --> 01:13:36.682
He'll call.

01:13:40.453 --> 01:13:43.222
Look at that donkey's ass
hanging off the wall over there.

01:13:43.223 --> 01:13:45.791
Somebody mounted the wrong end
of that thing.

01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:47.826
I bet if we walk around
the other side of the building,

01:13:47.827 --> 01:13:49.261
it'll just be stick--

01:13:51.398 --> 01:13:52.865
Y'ello.

01:13:57.671 --> 01:13:59.104
Yo.

01:13:59.105 --> 01:14:00.806
Oh, Mr. Deputy.

01:14:00.807 --> 01:14:01.874
Are you enjoying your stay

01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:04.076
in beautiful Mexico?

01:14:04.077 --> 01:14:07.046
<i>I've lost my
sense of humor, where's Annie?</i>

01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:08.847
No, no, no. Not to worry.

01:14:08.848 --> 01:14:10.983
We are taking great pleasure
in caring for her.

01:14:10.984 --> 01:14:13.419
You touch her and I'll kill you.

01:14:14.654 --> 01:14:17.756
It's not her I want.

01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:18.891
<i>It's you.</i>

01:14:18.892 --> 01:14:20.693
You bring Annie
to Rusty's Cantina.

01:14:20.694 --> 01:14:22.394
Rusty's Cantina, huh?

01:14:22.395 --> 01:14:24.830
<i>Good margaritas.</i>

01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:27.933
<i>Okey-dokey, Mr. Smokey.</i>

01:14:27.934 --> 01:14:30.035
<i>I'll meet you at sundown.</i>

01:14:30.036 --> 01:14:33.972
Bring my brother
if you want to see her alive.

01:14:35.442 --> 01:14:36.442
Let's go.

01:14:36.443 --> 01:14:37.743
Burn him.

01:14:42.582 --> 01:14:46.118
Your boyfriend.
He sounds like a very nice guy.

01:14:46.119 --> 01:14:48.420
I look forward to our meeting.

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:54.493
I was wondering, do you think
I should wear this or this?

01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:00.099
I think I will bring them both.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.294
Some really scary-looking
guys down there.

01:15:29.295 --> 01:15:32.264
Hey. What are you doing?

01:15:32.265 --> 01:15:33.732
I'm blending in.

01:15:33.733 --> 01:15:35.034
Well, you look ridiculous.

01:15:36.603 --> 01:15:38.237
And he doesn't?

01:15:48.648 --> 01:15:50.582
It's showtime, boys.
They're pulling in.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:53.752
What do you see?
About eight or 10 of them.

01:15:53.753 --> 01:15:55.788
There's Manuel,

01:15:55.789 --> 01:15:58.090
and they've got Annie.

01:15:58.091 --> 01:15:59.491
There's Johnny Franks.

01:15:59.492 --> 01:16:02.094
I knew that bastard had
something to do with this.

01:16:02.095 --> 01:16:03.929
Get that Mexican in the truck.

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:05.564
I knew I should have
brought a suitcase.

01:16:05.565 --> 01:16:06.565
Lonnie.

01:16:06.566 --> 01:16:08.667
What?
- Forget the sombrero.

01:16:08.668 --> 01:16:12.171
Rack, I paid 8 bucks for this.
I've always wanted one.

01:16:12.172 --> 01:16:14.206
Besides, right now
it's a disguise.

01:16:15.642 --> 01:16:19.044
But later it's a souvenir.

01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:21.246
Hold that, give me the hat,

01:16:21.247 --> 01:16:23.849
put all this stuff in a bag
and let's go, okay?

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.517
And bring a pillowcase with you.

01:16:25.518 --> 01:16:27.553
Pillowcase...

01:16:58.518 --> 01:17:01.353
Remember, when Tito is inside,
lock the doors.

01:17:17.237 --> 01:17:20.205
Welcome, Mr. Deputy.
I see you're right on time.

01:17:20.206 --> 01:17:22.975
Where is Annie?

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:24.376
What is the rush? Sit down.

01:17:24.377 --> 01:17:25.911
Have a drink.

01:17:25.912 --> 01:17:27.946
I don't drink with assholes.

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:31.483
Tell me, what is keeping me
from killing you right now?

01:17:35.922 --> 01:17:38.057
That was a perfectly good
donkey's ass.

01:17:38.058 --> 01:17:39.091
Ready to deal?

01:17:39.092 --> 01:17:41.427
Take your big gun away

01:17:41.428 --> 01:17:43.195
from the head of my brother
and release him.

01:17:43.196 --> 01:17:44.463
First, where's Annie?

01:17:46.132 --> 01:17:47.733
Right here, Rack.

01:17:47.734 --> 01:17:48.967
Buck?

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:50.869
How did you get involved
in this bullshit?

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:52.771
Bullshit?

01:17:52.772 --> 01:17:55.774
Well, I don't mean
to toot my own horn,

01:17:55.775 --> 01:17:58.143
but United Farm Enterprises

01:17:58.144 --> 01:18:00.412
is home to the biggest
meth lab in Oklahoma.

01:18:00.413 --> 01:18:02.114
I provide the land
and the buildings.

01:18:02.115 --> 01:18:05.651
And me, the manpower
and the distribution.

01:18:05.652 --> 01:18:07.386
I see you're in bed
with that damn DA, huh.

01:18:08.388 --> 01:18:10.956
Levin? Oh, he's no problem.

01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:13.392
Give him a little whiskey
and some cash,

01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:16.762
couple of fat Mexican whores,
he's happy as a pig in shit.

01:18:16.763 --> 01:18:18.530
No offense there, Manny.

01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:20.332
They're not all fat.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.201
So you see, pretty simple.

01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.671
I don't need a Deputy-Do-Right
and his girlfriend

01:18:25.672 --> 01:18:28.841
prowling around my ranch
making things complicated.

01:18:28.842 --> 01:18:30.009
Let her go, Buck.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.211
First, release my brother.

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:33.846
<i>Danger is often</i>

01:18:33.847 --> 01:18:37.516
<i>just an illusion</i>
<i>created in our minds.</i>

01:18:37.517 --> 01:18:39.785
When danger becomes a reality,

01:18:39.786 --> 01:18:42.388
it must be met head-on.

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:44.223
With an illusion.
What?

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:46.892
Tito, are you okay?

01:18:46.893 --> 01:18:48.460
<i>La puerta.</i> The door.

01:18:48.461 --> 01:18:50.329
The door?

01:18:51.931 --> 01:18:54.166
<i>Tengo gusto del quesa.</i>

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.868
You taste like cheese?

01:18:58.104 --> 01:18:59.171
Hi, everybody.

01:18:59.172 --> 01:19:00.773
What have you done
with my brother?

01:19:06.746 --> 01:19:08.080
Holy crap.

01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:39.078
Annie.

01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:40.045
Rack.

01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:42.548
Lonnie, cover me.

01:19:48.688 --> 01:19:51.457
Have you no pride, Santo?
Get up and fight!

01:19:58.431 --> 01:19:59.898
Cover me.

01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:02.267
Watch the suit, man.

01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:28.927
Whose idea
was it to lock this door?

01:20:41.541 --> 01:20:43.909
Manuel?

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:46.045
What did you do to my brother?

01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:48.480
Oh, crap.

01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:50.916
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:01.860
Junior.

01:21:04.798 --> 01:21:06.198
Let her go, Buck.

01:21:06.199 --> 01:21:07.533
Sorry, son.

01:21:07.534 --> 01:21:09.134
We've got to play
this thing out right now.

01:21:09.135 --> 01:21:11.837
You'd kill your own daughter?

01:21:11.838 --> 01:21:14.573
Stepdaughter ain't blood.

01:21:14.574 --> 01:21:16.508
You know, you should
never have come back, honey.

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:19.078
Your momma's gonna be okay.

01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:21.280
With all that goofy juice
I've been feeding her,

01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:23.248
she won't remember
her own name next week.

01:21:23.249 --> 01:21:24.683
You son of a bitch.

01:21:25.885 --> 01:21:27.353
That's it, Johnny.

01:21:27.354 --> 01:21:28.354
Send him to hell.

01:21:30.857 --> 01:21:32.491
Right destination,
wrong passenger.

01:21:32.492 --> 01:21:34.093
What?

01:21:34.094 --> 01:21:36.628
I don't believe we've met.
Agent Levon Spurlock, FBI.

01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:39.198
What?
Three years undercover, Buck.

01:21:39.199 --> 01:21:41.000
Glad to finally see you go down.

01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:53.879
Here, brother. I owe you one.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.948
It's gonna be okay. I got you.

01:21:58.785 --> 01:22:00.919
You all right, baby?

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.255
I am now.

01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:15.267
Hey, Rack.

01:22:15.268 --> 01:22:17.169
You know, these boots are nice.

01:22:17.170 --> 01:22:21.106
You can't find these Mexican
silver wing tips in Oklahoma.

01:22:21.107 --> 01:22:24.043
Hey, Johnny. Hey, Annie.

01:22:24.044 --> 01:22:25.744
Hi, Lonnie.

01:22:25.745 --> 01:22:27.446
Meet Agent Levon Spurlock.

01:22:28.648 --> 01:22:30.382
Hey, I'm Lonnie.

01:22:30.383 --> 01:22:32.051
Nice to meet you.

01:22:32.052 --> 01:22:33.485
Look at Junior.

01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:36.922
He put the kick-ass
smack down on Tito.

01:22:38.024 --> 01:22:39.625
Good dog, Junior.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:41.026
Police dog.

01:22:58.978 --> 01:23:01.280
<i>Manuel Garza,</i>

Look at the TV.

Hey, ain't that Johnny Franks?

01:23:22.502 --> 01:23:26.005
I'd say he is.

01:23:31.177 --> 01:23:33.679
Rack, it's the sheriff calling.
You want me to answer it?

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:37.449
Hell, no. If he's gonna fire me,
he's gonna fire me to my face.

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:39.385
Let's go in here
and have a beer, man.

01:23:39.386 --> 01:23:41.754
Looks real quiet tonight.

01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:44.523
Home sweet home, Lonnie.

01:23:56.069 --> 01:23:57.403
Nice stuff there, Rack.

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:02.007
There you go, Rack.
What's up, brother?

01:24:03.176 --> 01:24:07.179
I love it. Why you--

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.581
I missed you, baby girl.
Look what I got you.

01:24:09.582 --> 01:24:11.917
Oh, Lonnie...
- Got all your favorite colors.

01:24:11.918 --> 01:24:13.419
Oh, I love it,
I love it, I love it.

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.920
Oh, I love you. I--

01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:18.157
Hey, Jake, how about some
shot glasses over here?

01:24:24.831 --> 01:24:26.665
Good to see you, Annie.
You okay?

01:24:26.666 --> 01:24:28.400
Yeah.

01:24:28.401 --> 01:24:29.435
And I wanted to say

01:24:29.436 --> 01:24:32.104
thank you so much
for sending this posse

01:24:32.105 --> 01:24:34.139
to come and get me.
- Mm-hm.

01:24:36.276 --> 01:24:37.843
Disobeying orders,

01:24:37.844 --> 01:24:41.447
kidnapping a federal prisoner,

01:24:41.448 --> 01:24:43.849
illegal transfer of said
prisoner across state line,

01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:47.052
unauthorized transport

01:24:47.053 --> 01:24:50.956
and use of firearms
in a foreign country.

01:24:50.957 --> 01:24:52.558
Am I missing anything?

01:24:52.559 --> 01:24:54.026
Yup, yup, you are.

01:24:54.027 --> 01:24:58.063
Uh, not answering the department
issued phone when you called.

01:24:58.064 --> 01:25:02.768
I ought to kick your collective
asses right here and right now.

01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:05.604
Give me one good reason
why I don't lock you up.

01:25:05.605 --> 01:25:08.340
'Cause it's time for a toast.

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:15.247
Skunk, what is this?

01:25:15.248 --> 01:25:16.348
Circus jolly.

01:25:18.084 --> 01:25:20.819
Rack, Skunk said,
"Circus jolly."

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:23.389
Skunk, you have
a beautiful speaking voice.

01:25:25.091 --> 01:25:26.392
Well, let's hear it.

01:25:26.393 --> 01:25:28.127
Whiskey for my men.

01:25:28.128 --> 01:25:29.762
Beer for my horses.

01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:35.534
Oh, boy.

01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:37.870
That's circus jolly, sheriff.

01:25:37.871 --> 01:25:40.005
Yeah, well, it tastes
like elephant piss.

01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:43.742
# I'm on haystack kicking back
Three bails high #

01:25:43.743 --> 01:25:45.611
# A flat bed stage
And a full moon light #

01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:47.513
# Party on the farm
All night long #

01:25:47.514 --> 01:25:49.515
# With the moon shine flowin'
Till the break of dawn #

01:25:49.516 --> 01:25:51.250
Hey, Annie.

01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:54.653
Baby, I got something
I got to tell you.

01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:59.224
<i>When the sun don't rise</i>
<i>And the winds don't blow</i>

01:25:59.225 --> 01:26:01.293
<i>And the seas</i>
<i>Have left the shore</i>

01:26:01.294 --> 01:26:03.595
<i>I promise my dearest</i>
<i>With my dying breath</i>

01:26:03.596 --> 01:26:05.597
<i>To love you forevermore.</i>

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.737
Rack, that's the stupidest
shit I ever heard.

01:26:11.738 --> 01:26:14.073
Did you rip that
out of a Hallmark card

01:26:14.074 --> 01:26:16.275
from the drugstore
over in Mangum?

01:26:16.276 --> 01:26:18.977
No, baby,
I got it from Harveyetta,

01:26:18.978 --> 01:26:20.746
a hooker from Sweetwater.

01:26:20.747 --> 01:26:22.147
# Twelve gauge
Underneath the seat #

01:26:22.148 --> 01:26:23.916
# Gonna raise a little hell
To a down on beat #

01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:26.151
Rack.

01:26:26.152 --> 01:26:28.954
Junior just farted.
Something big's about to happen.

01:26:30.557 --> 01:26:34.226
<i># It's off the hillbilly hook</i>
<i>Off the redneck chain #</i>

01:26:34.227 --> 01:26:38.464

<i>It's a runaway train #</i>

01:26:38.465 --> 01:26:42.201

01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:44.203

01:26:53.046 --> 01:26:54.513
<i># Yeah, yeah #</i>

01:26:54.514 --> 01:26:57.116
<i># Get up, get up #</i>

01:26:57.117 --> 01:26:58.951

01:26:58.952 --> 01:27:01.286

01:27:25.111 --> 01:27:29.081
<i># Somebody blew up a building</i>
<i>Somebody stole a car #</i>

01:27:29.082 --> 01:27:33.252

01:27:33.253 --> 01:27:34.920

01:27:34.921 --> 01:27:37.256
