WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:06.238
Brave warriors,
today begins our quest

00:06.240 --> 00:08.507
to save our home!

00:08.509 --> 00:10.442
All:
The warlock's chest.
Yes.

00:10.444 --> 00:14.313
Our beloved sanctuary
has been marked for demolition.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.415
So, brandish your
clipboards,

00:16.417 --> 00:18.250
unsheathe your pens

00:18.252 --> 00:23.322
and collect the signatures
i need to make it

00:23.324 --> 00:26.625
onto the west altadenia
alderman's ballot.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.328
Seriously, guys, get going.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.329
It's Thanksgiving.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.597
I said that I would help

00:31.599 --> 00:32.798
set the table, so please.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.201
What the hell is this?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.737
Cabe. Oh, cabe!

00:38.739 --> 00:41.407
You've come to help me get
signatures for my campaign.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.076
No, I'm here to help Paige get
some potatoes for the dinner,

00:44.078 --> 00:45.477
which you better not miss
because you're playing

00:45.479 --> 00:46.812
dress-up with your chums.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.581
Cripes, man, how old are you?

00:49.583 --> 00:53.585
I am dyfrost the wise
and I've seen 50 winters.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.387
Go away.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.692
Kid, nerds dressed up
in their mother's bathrobes,

01:00.694 --> 01:05.097
harassing the electorate,
isn't how you win an election.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.231
Uh, well...

01:06.233 --> 01:08.267
Dressing up gets
people's attention.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.103
It was kaldor's idea,
my, uh, campaign manager.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.306
Statistically, there's more
foot traffic on Thanksgiving.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.574
It's the perfect way to...

01:15.576 --> 01:17.087
Piss people off.

01:17.088 --> 01:18.599
They got to feed
20 relatives today;

01:18.600 --> 01:20.111
they don't want to be bothered
by a bunch of freaky wizards.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.647
So, you come back
on a Sunday morning,

01:21.649 --> 01:24.483
when folks are relaxed,
then you'll get your signatures.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.352
That's actually a good idea.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.353
But what about him?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.788
People are
lining up for him.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.123
He's not even set up yet.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.791
He's giving away
free cranberry sauce.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.159
Oh, great, 99 cents a can.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.394
200 bucks and he gets every

01:35.396 --> 01:37.463
signature he needs.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.864
Is that Toby?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.232
What the heck, man?!

01:40.234 --> 01:41.700
You're fraternizing
with the enemy!

01:41.702 --> 01:43.836
Paige makes that homemade
cranberry sauce.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.271
I swung by here to pick up
some of the good stuff.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.806
It's a good thing I ran
into that guy, huh?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.608
He's the competition.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.176
Oh, well, relax.
I used a fake name.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.478
Signature's not valid.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.913
Mr. Curtis.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.347
Excuse me, you
left your license.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.452
I'm sorry, man.
They asked for ID.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.687
It was free sauce.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.889
You must be my competition.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.291
I'm Dr. Sanjay patel.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.260
Sylvester dodd.
Doctor?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.561
Oh, what's your specialty?

02:09.563 --> 02:11.763
I have a phd in geology.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.015
Funny how they throw

02:13.016 --> 02:14.266
the term doctor
around, isn't it?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.467
Sanjay,

02:15.469 --> 02:16.768
we're running
out of cans.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.903
We need to restock.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.771
Everyone,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.473
this is
my campaign manager,

02:21.475 --> 02:22.541
Allie Jones.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.644
Allie,
our esteemed opponent.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.179
Mr. dodd, a pleasure.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.780
I'd love to
introduce myself

02:28.782 --> 02:31.483
to your campaign
manager if he's around.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.785
(Shouting)

02:33.787 --> 02:35.587
He's not here.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.289
Uh... I'm-I'm running in.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.924
I could, I could grab
some cranberry sauce

02:38.926 --> 02:39.925
for you so you won't

02:39.927 --> 02:41.727
lose your, uh,
your post there.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.328
My name is Gabe, cabe.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.796
Cabe, cabe gallo.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.797
Scottish cabe.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.199
Italian gallo.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.767
A little Gaelic and garlic.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.801
Fun.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.503
And I do

02:51.505 --> 02:53.438
appreciate the help;
I'll be right over there.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.807
It's great to
meet all of you.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.543
Sanjay, we should
really get back.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.445
Toby:
Look at him.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.748
Flush, red
around the ears.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.917
I'd say Turkey
isn't the only bird

03:04.919 --> 03:07.719
cabe's got
his eye on today.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.854
And my Harvard-trained
preceptors tell me that

03:08.856 --> 03:10.756
she was flirting with you.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.495
Shouldn't slap
another man's sauce.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.496
Where's cabe?

03:17.498 --> 03:18.630
I sent him to buy some potatoes,

03:18.632 --> 03:19.698
not grow them.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.899
Happy, can you help me

03:20.901 --> 03:21.967
with the pies?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.902
Happy?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.370
Oh.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.939
What the heck is that?

03:26.941 --> 03:28.440
I asked you to pick me up
a carving knife,

03:28.442 --> 03:30.009
not something from<i> mad Max.</i>

03:30.010 --> 03:31.577
I know, but I was thinking
about the engineering

03:31.579 --> 03:33.478
of electric knives
and how they're

03:33.480 --> 03:34.980
underutilized,
so I made this.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.251
Check it out.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.520
It toasts the bread
while it cuts.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.821
We call it
the toasty-slicey.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.306
The slicey-toasty.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.790
Guys, all I want is a
traditional family dinner.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.259
Turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie,

03:47.261 --> 03:49.528
so please, no more genius-y
stuff, not today.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.963
(Walter clears his throat)

03:53.701 --> 03:54.700
My electrolyte
elixir worked.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.867
Oh, god, help me.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.868
Smells good in here.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.403
Well, I really hope you...

03:58.405 --> 04:00.939
Like stuffing 'cause that's
all I've made so far.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.542
Well, I've made strides
that prove that my new drink

04:03.544 --> 04:05.444
substantially enhances
athletic endeavors.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.678
You drank that sludge?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.280
Fastest Turkey trot
I've ever run.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.681
No muscle cramping,
no dehydration,

04:09.683 --> 04:11.483
and it is all thanks
to Wally's invention.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.784
And timbo's peak
performance.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.785
(Chuckles)
(Phone rings)

04:13.787 --> 04:15.420
Excuse me,
got to get this.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.888
Walter: Yes.
Wally and timbo?
Seriously?

04:16.890 --> 04:19.691
Yeah, you wanted us to get
along, we're getting along.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.693
Glad you're friends,
just got to tell you,

04:21.695 --> 04:22.894
it's a little... weird.
(Chuckles)

04:22.896 --> 04:25.163
You'd rather us be enemies?
No.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.431
It's just... Walter's not one
to, uh, make friends

04:27.434 --> 04:30.802
with humans, so... guess you
must be a pretty special human.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.437
Mm.
Walter:
Great. See you then.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.273
Great news.
We just picked up a job.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.274
For when?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.009
Now.
Let's gear up.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.777
No! I've been planning this meal

04:38.779 --> 04:40.345
for a week,
and I need help,

04:40.347 --> 04:41.780
and there's no way
we're taking off

04:41.782 --> 04:43.415
for the south seas
or the Ukraine.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.049
This is Thanksgiving and we're
gonna have a happy, family meal,

04:45.052 --> 04:46.418
damn it.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.686
(Sighs)

04:47.688 --> 04:48.854
It's not the Ukraine.

04:48.856 --> 04:49.988
It's El Segundo.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.523
And it's a quick
structural inspection.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.991
Some real estate investor,

04:52.993 --> 04:55.661
named Veronica Franklin,
needs to have permit paperwork

04:55.663 --> 04:58.030
to the city by Monday morning,
but everyone's gone

04:58.032 --> 04:59.415
because of the holiday weekend.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.799
Nice.
Desperation prices.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.634
Exactly. Top dollar
for a few hours' work

05:02.636 --> 05:03.635
and we desperately need

05:03.637 --> 05:04.636
to refill our slush fund.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.637
No, we don't.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.673
Slush fund's fine.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.708
Actually, it's been financing
my recent inventions,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.293
like genius water.

05:11.294 --> 05:12.877
You can't call it that.
There's already smart water.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.780
That's a good point.
We should brainstorm.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.404
No! No brainstorming.

05:16.405 --> 05:18.027
I can't believe you guys
are gonna mess up Thanksgiving.

05:18.028 --> 05:19.650
Do you know how hard it is
not to screw up a Turkey?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.752
Just pop that fowl in the oven.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.020
We'll be back in a few hours.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.789
The client is
at the end of her rope.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.390
She saw an article
about scorpion,

05:25.392 --> 05:26.858
read that we employed
a genius engineer.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.727
Guilty as charged.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.997
You always say that scorpion
is about helping people.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.099
Now, you get her to sign
the paperwork while we work,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.801
and we'll be done
before you know it.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.736
(Car horn honks)

05:37.738 --> 05:40.372
Oh, hey, there's
the others.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.973
Ralph, help sly
unload the groceries

05:41.975 --> 05:43.075
and I'll get the
contracts together.

05:43.077 --> 05:44.743
And, Walter,

05:44.744 --> 05:46.410
if my Turkey
is not cooked in time,

05:46.413 --> 05:47.646
your goose will be.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.095
Joint's falling apart.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.847
What is it?

06:04.848 --> 06:06.598
Cabe:
It's an old philochrome
film manufacturing plant,

06:06.600 --> 06:07.599
been empty for decades.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.599
Guys...
(Indistinct conversation)

06:08.602 --> 06:10.102
You hear something?

06:10.104 --> 06:11.403
Yeah, actually I do.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.537
It sounds like...

06:12.539 --> 06:14.406
Cantonese.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.640
(Laughing):
Oh, yeah.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.159
Yeah, it's
a business deal.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.677
They're negotiating.
You know cantonese?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.145
Well, how do you expect me
to watch lectures

06:20.147 --> 06:21.580
by Chinese physicists?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.081
(Speaking cantonese)

06:23.083 --> 06:25.384
Walter:
Ms. Franklin?

06:25.386 --> 06:27.085
Yeah, I'm Walter o'brien.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.487
We-we spoke on the phone.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.521
Hello.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.756
Thank you for coming.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.124
Walter:
Certainly,
Ms. Franklin.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.725
Uh, tell me how
we can help you.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.995
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.630
You okay, kid?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.932
Paige, just hear me out.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.134
How does Ms. Franklin
know your name?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.102
Her last name is not Franklin.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.470
It's dineen.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.671
She's my mother.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.142
Not good?

06:50.144 --> 06:52.144
I know this is
a lot to process,

06:52.146 --> 06:53.512
but I really need your help

06:53.514 --> 06:54.746
and you're the only person
i could turn to.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.548
I don't want anything
to do with you

06:56.550 --> 06:58.016
or whatever you're trying
to get us involved in.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.651
Yeah, what are
we involved in?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.486
An uncomfortable
family squabble.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.888
Well, it's
about the building.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.556
I assume it's not

07:04.558 --> 07:06.591
the structural issue that
you mentioned on the phone.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.559
That's correct.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.660
What a shock;

07:08.661 --> 07:09.760
mom playing fast and loose
with the truth.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.630
I had to be sure
that you would come.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.932
You see, I've been following
scorpion in the news.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.317
What?

07:15.318 --> 07:16.701
I can't be interested
in my daughter's life?

07:16.703 --> 07:18.003
Since when?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.905
(Sighs)
And I knew that scorpion

07:19.907 --> 07:20.906
was the type of business

07:20.908 --> 07:22.441
that could help me.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.875
How do we help
you exactly?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.177
See, uh,

07:25.179 --> 07:26.178
over there?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.646
We found this very old

07:27.648 --> 07:28.780
piece of machinery

07:28.782 --> 07:31.516
and it was covered
in warning stickers:

07:31.518 --> 07:33.518
"Danger."
"Hazardous materials."

07:33.520 --> 07:35.520
And I just didn't know
what to do.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.922
Okay, well, I can check it out,
Ms. dineen, yeah.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.457
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.
Walter: Sure.
N-no.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.058
No, we're not helping her.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.927
Walter.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.995
We don't entertain her lies.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.197
You guys, we can't believe

07:45.199 --> 07:46.498
anything she says.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.133
Veronica:
Yes, you can. You see,

07:48.135 --> 07:51.670
I represent Swiss bankers
who are buying this property.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.206
Now, I hired a few
day laborers to relay

07:54.208 --> 07:55.540
a little bit
of the foundation

07:55.542 --> 07:59.478
there, but vibrations
from the jackhammer

07:59.480 --> 08:01.847
forced this fake wall
to fall down

08:01.849 --> 08:04.916
and-and underneath it there
was a-an old elevator shaft

08:04.918 --> 08:07.402
with the machinery in it.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.887
And I figured only a team
of geniuses could help me.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.256
Well, you figured wrong.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.691
Walter:
Happy,
you got to check

08:12.693 --> 08:13.792
this out.
Come, hurry!

08:13.794 --> 08:15.627
No, I just said
we're not helping.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.628
How is that not clear?!

08:16.630 --> 08:18.597
Uh, uh, pal?
Uh, you are, uh...

08:18.599 --> 08:21.266
How do I put this?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.168
You're letting the weight
of your emotional baggage

08:23.170 --> 08:24.970
crash your Paige plane.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.738
You see,
you control how you react

08:26.740 --> 08:28.039
to this unforeseen development.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.708
Toby, I swear I will stuff
my foot in your business

08:29.710 --> 08:31.009
like you're
a Thanksgiving Turkey.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.745
And our session is complete.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.847
Guys, I am the manager
of this team,

08:35.849 --> 08:38.016
and we are not taking
this case, period.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.050
We're taking this case.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.752
Are you kidding me?!
Why?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.788
Because the machine in the
back is a nuclear reactor.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.925
(Under breath):
Oh, I'm never finishing
that Turkey.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.994
♪ ♪

08:56.670 --> 08:57.836
Seems like
a nobelium neutron activator.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.272
Probably loaded
with three pounds

09:00.274 --> 09:01.540
of enriched uranium plates.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.542
Like the californium

09:03.544 --> 09:04.976
neutron flux multiplier

09:04.978 --> 09:06.711
that Kodak put in the bottom

09:06.713 --> 09:08.880
of their Rochester,
New York facility in '74,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.816
except theirs wasn't capable
of nuclear fission.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.118
Well, this one is.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.686
Why would

09:14.688 --> 09:16.321
philochrome
have a reactor?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.056
To run power-hungry equipment
that checks

09:18.058 --> 09:19.691
for the impurities in film,

09:19.693 --> 09:21.259
neutron radiography testing,

09:21.261 --> 09:22.961
plenty of other applications.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.729
This is the stuff of legends.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.981
Decades ago,

09:25.982 --> 09:27.232
a handful of private companies
built their own

09:27.234 --> 09:29.034
mini-reactors
and they hid them.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.769
Can't believe
we actually found one.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.038
Okay, but how
is it still running

09:33.040 --> 09:34.339
in an abandoned building?

09:34.341 --> 09:35.340
Right here.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.675
Illegally spliced

09:36.677 --> 09:38.276
into the power grid.
When the company

09:38.278 --> 09:40.979
went belly up, everyone boogied
and left this thing here.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.714
(Wood and metal groans,
then crashes)

09:42.716 --> 09:43.848
Happy: Whoa.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.750
What in the hell was that?

09:47.854 --> 09:50.155
All the jackhammering
weakened the foundation

09:50.157 --> 09:51.856
around the support beams.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.358
Whole basement's unstable.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.694
Piece of ceiling or column could
fall and hit on the reactor.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.829
But the reactor's
encased, right?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.598
So...
Well, the cooling
system isn't.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.599
Look at, you
see these pipes?

10:00.601 --> 10:01.933
When this system was built,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.868
they used a liquid
metal process made

10:03.870 --> 10:05.370
of sodium and potassium.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.072
It doesn't corrode
the pipes inside

10:07.074 --> 10:08.740
like water-based systems, but...

10:08.742 --> 10:10.208
Always a but.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.110
They soon realized
that sodium and potassium

10:12.112 --> 10:14.746
react explosively
when exposed to water,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.748
even with trace amounts of water
in the air.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.049
So, if there's
a collapse in here

10:18.051 --> 10:19.284
and it breaks
one of those pipes...

10:19.286 --> 10:21.386
The cooling system goes boom.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.188
On top of a
nuclear reactor.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.389
In the middle of Los Angeles.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.957
Mushroom cloud city.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.826
Millions of people at risk.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.027
Cabe:
I'll make the necessary calls.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.296
(Veronica sighs)

10:31.298 --> 10:33.999
Thank goodness
i called for help.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.367
You're seriously taking credit

10:35.369 --> 10:37.002
when you're the one
who made this mess?

10:37.004 --> 10:39.070
I certainly did not.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.672
I didn't let this building
rot to the point

10:40.674 --> 10:41.773
where it's dangerous, I didn't

10:41.775 --> 10:43.108
put liquid metal
in those pipes.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.109
And I surely

10:44.111 --> 10:46.311
didn't build an
illegal reactor.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.079
No, you just walked back
into my life

10:48.081 --> 10:49.548
after a decade,

10:49.549 --> 10:51.016
more than happy
to blow it up again,

10:51.018 --> 10:52.951
figuratively and literally.

10:52.953 --> 10:53.918
Paige...
What are you

10:53.920 --> 10:55.820
doing in this building, mom?

10:55.822 --> 10:56.988
'Cause we all know
you're up to something,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.223
as usual!
Paige...

10:58.225 --> 11:00.025
You're upset, we'll talk
about this later.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.126
I have nothing to say to you,

11:01.128 --> 11:03.194
except go back
to where you came from.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.195
And the bell ends the round.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.230
We are gonna step outside,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.431
take some breaths and calm down.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.035
Keep her away from me.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.906
So...

11:15.876 --> 11:17.308
Thanksgiving plans?

11:17.310 --> 11:18.843
This is ridiculous.
I am gonna go

11:18.845 --> 11:19.978
talk to her right now.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.312
I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.114
I'm sorry, and you are?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.382
Tim Armstrong, I'm...

11:24.384 --> 11:25.984
Dating your daughter.
It's nice to meet you.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.720
Well, Tim, I'm glad you know
what my daughter needs,

11:28.722 --> 11:29.721
after dating her

11:29.723 --> 11:31.122
for how long?
A few months.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.258
Oh, okay, well,

11:33.260 --> 11:35.994
I gave birth to her
when I was 17.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.229
I saw her through everything
from tonsillitis

11:38.231 --> 11:40.265
to tap dancing,
so I appreciate your concern

11:40.267 --> 11:42.867
for her well-being,
but I know what's best for her,

11:42.869 --> 11:46.805
and what's best is for she and i
to talk this out.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.107
I agree and you should, just...

11:49.109 --> 11:50.241
Not right now.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.409
Cabe:
Thanks for nothing!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.044
(Phone beeps)
What?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.013
State nuclear facility says

11:55.015 --> 11:57.348
their closest inspectors
are two hours away.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.416
They're rushing 'em to L.A. now.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.351
We could have an
explosion by then.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.920
Understood, but
we're dealing with

12:01.922 --> 12:03.154
a government bureaucracy

12:03.156 --> 12:04.700
on a four-day
holiday weekend.

12:04.701 --> 12:06.245
Most of the people
i need to talk to

12:06.246 --> 12:07.790
traveled yesterday to
be with their families.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.461
Cabe, did you try homeland?
Yeah,

12:09.463 --> 12:10.995
I did, and homeland said,

12:10.997 --> 12:12.097
with a problem like this,

12:12.099 --> 12:13.098
they'd call scorpion.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.299
They did offer

12:14.301 --> 12:15.467
logistical help if we need it.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.368
So we need a lead-lined
facility,

12:17.370 --> 12:19.471
simple underground structure
so nothing could fall

12:19.473 --> 12:21.840
on it, ideally on bedrock

12:21.842 --> 12:23.842
to protect the pipes
from breaking

12:23.844 --> 12:25.477
in unforeseen seismic activity.

12:25.479 --> 12:26.978
Then what we do is
we just keep it there

12:26.980 --> 12:28.313
until the nuclear commission

12:28.315 --> 12:29.981
can properly dismantle it.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.516
Ralph and I are
searching for something

12:31.518 --> 12:33.351
matching those specs now!

12:33.352 --> 12:35.185
But if we remove the reactor
from its power source,

12:35.188 --> 12:36.454
the cooling system shuts off--

12:36.456 --> 12:37.989
nuclear meltdown.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.190
That's why we need a truck.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.925
We secure the reactor
in the back,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.194
I'll rig the truck's battery
to the cooling system.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.363
That'll give us
about 31 minutes to

12:45.365 --> 12:46.931
get the nuke to
wherever it's going.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.200
I have a rented truck outside

12:49.202 --> 12:50.935
for the equipment.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.004
A-a truck for a
few jackhammers?

12:53.006 --> 12:55.473
It was all they had, so...

12:55.475 --> 12:59.144
Everything she's involved with
is suspicious.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.311
You keep saying that--
that she's a liar,

13:00.313 --> 13:01.379
she's duplicitous,
she's sneaky--

13:01.381 --> 13:02.914
but unless you tell me

13:02.916 --> 13:04.082
why you feel that way,
i can't help you.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.350
Okay, you want to hear it? Fine.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.452
What was your hourly
private practice rate?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.853
Well, it was $400 an hour.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.455
Problem was,
racetrack made $500.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.823
Well, here's 20 bucks.

13:11.825 --> 13:12.991
You're retained.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.425
Patient-doctor confidentiality.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.894
You cannot tell
anyone on the team.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.396
Legally I can't,

13:17.397 --> 13:18.897
but i-i wouldn't anyway
if you had just asked.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.432
That being said,
I'm keeping the $20.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.403
My mother is a con woman,

13:25.405 --> 13:28.072
a first-degree grifter.
Growing up,

13:28.074 --> 13:29.574
she was in everything
from pyramid schemes

13:29.576 --> 13:31.209
that ripped off pta moms

13:31.211 --> 13:33.478
to selling time-shares
that she didn't own.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.113
How did that affect
your relationship?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.848
Relationship?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.516
What relationship?

13:38.518 --> 13:39.851
She was always doing time--

13:39.853 --> 13:41.219
six months here,
eight months there.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.021
I told my friends
that she was a saleswoman

13:43.023 --> 13:44.155
who traveled the world

13:44.157 --> 13:47.058
making custom perfumes
for celebrities.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.526
And my dad worshipped her,

13:48.528 --> 13:50.428
and when he finally moved out,

13:50.430 --> 13:52.330
he took me with him
because he knew

13:52.332 --> 13:54.432
being around her
was unhealthy for a child.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.401
He was right.
And every once in a while,

13:56.403 --> 13:58.203
she would--
she would show up and--

13:58.205 --> 13:59.838
and bring me a gift

13:59.839 --> 14:01.472
and I wouldn't open it because
i knew how she paid for it.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.441
With money that belonged to
someone who had been swindled.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.943
(Voice breaking):
And my father died...

14:12.018 --> 14:13.585
My father...

14:13.587 --> 14:17.956
Died heartbroken because of
the woman that you met today.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.328
Whatever.
I-I've made my peace with it.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.897
Paige, you have not
made your peace with it.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.900
You have built-up anger
and that's harmful.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.069
You need to talk to your mother
in a constructive way,

14:31.071 --> 14:32.370
let her know how
she's made you feel.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.405
No, if it were easy
talking to Veronica dineen,

14:34.407 --> 14:36.908
I would have had it out with her
a long time ago.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.443
For years
i have searched my soul

14:38.445 --> 14:41.179
for any love
i have left for her and...

14:41.181 --> 14:42.347
I've found nothing.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.482
(Computer beeps)
I found something!

14:44.484 --> 14:45.316
What do you have?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.102
In the 1950s

14:47.103 --> 14:48.887
solarsun pictures built
an underground film vault

14:48.889 --> 14:50.889
in palos verdes
to preserve their film library.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.457
Been empty since
everything went digital.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.425
Walter, according
to this site,

14:54.427 --> 14:56.427
the vault is lead-lined
and airtight!

14:56.429 --> 14:58.263
And it's on bedrock.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.298
So, for safety's sake,
we shouldn't drive

15:00.300 --> 15:01.532
over 25 miles per hour

15:01.534 --> 15:03.902
with the reactor in the truck,
but palos verdes

15:03.904 --> 15:05.737
is only 11 miles away,

15:05.738 --> 15:07.571
so we get there well before
the truck's battery can

15:07.574 --> 15:10.041
no longer keep
the cooling system operational.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.676
I got a question.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.678
This thing weighs
several hundred pounds.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.013
How are we gonna get it

15:15.015 --> 15:17.081
out of here and into a truck

15:17.083 --> 15:19.417
without banging it around
so much

15:19.419 --> 15:20.952
that we all get toasted?

15:20.953 --> 15:22.486
Happy: We got to figure out
a way to get this up the shaft,

15:22.489 --> 15:23.521
to the first floor
and out the door.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.189
It's only ten feet.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.258
Yeah, well,
it might as well be a hundred.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.626
Not necessarily.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.695
Happy, get the car Jack
from cabe's truck.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.130
Roger that.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.132
Now, everyone,
look for something that we can

15:34.134 --> 15:36.134
put under the reactor.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.138
(Grunting)

15:40.140 --> 15:41.573
Hey!

15:41.574 --> 15:43.007
This thing is full
of film canisters!

15:43.009 --> 15:44.442
Would these work?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.010
Found some trade binders!

15:46.012 --> 15:47.345
We can put the Jack on these!

15:47.347 --> 15:50.081
Great, bring them over!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.118
Move out of the way!

15:55.121 --> 15:57.555
(Jack cranking)

16:02.395 --> 16:04.095
Okay, cabe, Tim,

16:04.097 --> 16:05.096
stack the canisters
under the pallet.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.402
Power cables are pulled tight.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.737
I'll have to disconnect 'em
from the grid.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.071
Once I do that,
the cooling system goes down

16:14.074 --> 16:15.740
and the reactor
starts heating up.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.141
Walter, how much time
do we have to connect it

16:17.143 --> 16:18.409
to the truck battery
before meltdown?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.545
Well, if I'm right about
the uranium contents,

16:20.547 --> 16:21.612
I'd say 19 minutes.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.014
That's not a lot of time.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.049
(Grunts)
Well, there's never enough time.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.617
Here, start unhooking it.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.319
Um, while they're doing that,

16:28.321 --> 16:29.620
may I talk to you for a moment?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.290
Uh, yeah, but it'll
have to be quick 'cause

16:32.292 --> 16:33.758
they're nearly done.
Okay, understood. Just...

16:34.694 --> 16:37.996
You know, um,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.530
I know today
has been volatile.

16:39.532 --> 16:43.167
But it was never my intention to
turn your company upside down.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.569
Oh, no, it's okay.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.038
Uh, emotional situations
are always--

16:47.040 --> 16:48.573
often dysfunctional.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.175
Oh, well, everything
between Paige and I

16:51.177 --> 16:52.777
has been dysfunctional
for some time now.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.580
I was terrified
for a while--

16:55.582 --> 16:58.049
you know, how she'd turn out--

16:58.051 --> 16:59.083
she was rudderless,

16:59.085 --> 17:01.185
single mom,
dropped out of school.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.788
So, when I saw her name

17:03.790 --> 17:06.090
mentioned in articles
i read about scorpion,

17:06.092 --> 17:07.592
uh...
(Chuckles)

17:07.594 --> 17:09.260
I was relieved.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.629
She seems to have found a home,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.798
and I'm appreciative of that
more than you could ever know.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.133
So thank you.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.568
Well, we appreciate Paige.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.804
She's very, uh...

17:20.740 --> 17:22.774
She brings intangibles.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.544
You seem to really care for her.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.347
As a-- as a valued member
of the team, of course.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.782
Yeah, she's t-top notch.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.617
So, um, okay.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.385
Oh, no, we...
Oh, can I just...

17:34.387 --> 17:37.455
Thank you for listening
and being so kind.

17:37.457 --> 17:41.225
I mean, between Paige and Tim,

17:41.227 --> 17:43.494
I haven't received
a very warm welcome.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.830
Oh, well, Tim is...

17:45.832 --> 17:47.498
(Chuckles)
An acquired taste.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.435
Uh, i-i didn't much like him
when he first came to scorpion.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.105
Oh, he's not one of
the original geniuses?

17:54.107 --> 17:56.140
Oh, no. He's not a genius.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.542
Then why is he on the team?

17:57.544 --> 18:00.178
Well, he's a
homeland trainee.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.512
Oh.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.250
Paige:
<i> I mean, you have no idea</i>

18:06.252 --> 18:07.251
how manipulative she is!

18:07.253 --> 18:08.653
One conversation and she has you

18:08.655 --> 18:11.089
doubting yourself!
This is not worth $20.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.223
(Phone ringing)

18:12.225 --> 18:13.491
Oh, thank god.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.196
Hello.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.197
Doc, you, Paige and Veronica
need to take her truck

18:20.200 --> 18:21.666
and pick up packing materials
to cushion the reactor

18:21.668 --> 18:22.667
during the drive.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.652
Veronica's on her way up.

18:24.653 --> 18:26.636
I'm not going anywhere with her!
Why is she even still here?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.372
'Cause we need the manpower
to load up the truck,

18:28.374 --> 18:29.607
and there isn't much time!

18:29.609 --> 18:31.142
I'm about to disconnect
the power cables,

18:31.144 --> 18:33.478
so we'll have less than
20 minutes until meltdown.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.313
Well, I feel like I'm about
to have a meltdown.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.481
About to?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.450
(Powering down)

18:40.787 --> 18:42.420
Okay, here we go.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.322
(Cranking)

18:46.292 --> 18:47.725
Keep it steady!

18:47.727 --> 18:49.293
Thank you for the
obvious advice.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.695
Canisters!
Okay!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.632
(Cabe grunts)

18:55.602 --> 18:57.268
Binders!

18:57.270 --> 18:58.636
Oh, I got it!

19:08.414 --> 19:09.914
(Cabe grunting)

19:15.221 --> 19:18.589
(Creaking)

19:18.591 --> 19:19.891
Almost to the first floor.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.826
Cabe, get up there
and pull that sucker out!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.661
On my way!

19:29.202 --> 19:32.637
So, Veronica, which field
of real estate are you in?

19:32.639 --> 19:33.704
Development, finance.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.705
Fraudulent transactions.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.307
Not helpful.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.908
And, uh,
you work out of L.A. mostly?

19:37.911 --> 19:40.811
Actually, I live just
outside of scottsdale.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.129
A lovely gated community.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.446
But I hate talking
about myself.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.183
(Chuckling)
I'd like to

19:45.185 --> 19:46.450
catch up with
my daughter,

19:46.452 --> 19:48.319
but since she won't
speak with me,

19:48.321 --> 19:50.488
maybe you could fill
me in on her life.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.423
I'd love to hear
about her boyfriend,

19:52.425 --> 19:54.258
Tim?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.462
(Whispers):
I will kill you.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.832
Doctor?
I think he's a Virgo.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.701
No, no, no. No, no.
We are not going to sit here

20:03.703 --> 20:05.236
and discuss my life
in front of someone

20:05.238 --> 20:06.604
who has not been
a part of that life.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.605
I'm making an effort,

20:07.607 --> 20:09.473
Paige.
20 years too late!

20:09.475 --> 20:11.075
I am uncomfortable.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.676
Okay, what is your real agenda?
Why-why are you in L.A.?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.478
Why did you call my company
into this thing?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.880
One, I don't
have an agenda.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.648
Two, I'm in L.A.
on business.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.483
And three,
i needed help

20:19.485 --> 20:21.319
and wanted to
reconnect with you.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.486
I don't believe
anything you say.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.554
Now pull in here.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.327
En garde!

20:31.231 --> 20:33.497
Toby:
Oh, see this is why
i didn't do family therapy.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.932
Oh, great.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.366
Hardware store is closed
'cause of Thanksgiving.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.269
What are we gonna do now?
Walter says

20:38.271 --> 20:39.770
we need materials
to cushion the reactor.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.389
I have an idea.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.007
Support Sanjay patel
for alderman?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.576
I'm a Sylvester dodd woman.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.346
She's having a rough day.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.417
Good job, happy! It's almost
level with the floor.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.486
Okay, should be just
about there.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.689
Cabe: Hey, it's started swaying,
you guys!

20:58.691 --> 20:59.890
Oh, crap.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.661
The canisters are falling!

21:06.666 --> 21:08.366
Okay, I'll restack
the binders! Happy,

21:08.368 --> 21:09.834
get the Jack in
place for support!

21:09.836 --> 21:11.869
Come on.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.305
(Grunting)

21:14.307 --> 21:16.507
Uh, big problem!

21:16.509 --> 21:18.960
Jack broke!

21:18.961 --> 21:21.412
Get out from under there
before that thing crushes you!

21:21.414 --> 21:22.680
If this thing falls,
the pipes break,

21:22.682 --> 21:25.316
liquid metal exposed.
And then mushroom cloud.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.020
(Grunting)

21:35.995 --> 21:37.795
All right!

21:37.797 --> 21:40.498
We are not gonna be able
to hold this thing very long.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.634
Cabe: We gotta figure out a way
to get this weight off them!

21:43.636 --> 21:45.970
Uh, give me a second!

21:45.972 --> 21:47.638
I hope your back's
feeling strong,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.340
cabe, I got a plan.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.345
I'm gonna jam this sucker
under those bars

21:54.347 --> 21:55.680
on top of the reactor.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.415
Don't hit
the coolant pipes!

21:57.417 --> 22:00.685
No duh! Push down hard
on the seesaw.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.653
(Creaking)

22:02.655 --> 22:04.955
Yeah, it's not all the way
to the top.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.457
Happy:
I can see.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.558
Cabe, lie on the bar.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.826
What?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.027
Just lie on the damn bar!

22:10.029 --> 22:11.629
(Straining)

22:16.569 --> 22:18.936
Hyah!

22:25.712 --> 22:27.011
We got it.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.715
(À la Ricky Ricardo):
Sweetheart,

22:30.717 --> 22:34.585
you have some 'splaining to do.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.454
Careful.
Careful with that.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.456
You get the packing
material?
Hardware store was closed.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.790
We had to improvise.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.126
Toilet paper and marshmallows.
Yeah, that'll work.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.861
So, happy, we have
six and a half minutes

22:43.862 --> 22:45.595
to get the reactor hooked up
to the truck's battery.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.131
Okay, get that beast to the
back, and I'll have it ready

22:47.133 --> 22:49.066
in less than five.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.937
Done!

22:52.939 --> 22:54.772
With 91 seconds to spare.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.107
This is what you do
for a living?

22:56.109 --> 22:57.808
This'll keep the reactor cool
for 31 minutes.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.143
That's more than
enough time

22:59.145 --> 23:00.778
to get to the film
storage bunkers.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.280
So, happy, we need
to stay in the back

23:02.281 --> 23:03.781
and monitor the temperature
and mechanics.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.783
If the pipes break,
the cooling system fails,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.435
and then mushroom cloud.

23:07.436 --> 23:09.086
Tim, cabe, hold
the reactor steady.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.554
If they bounce too much,
mushroom cloud.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.757
And then, Paige, Toby,
drive cautiously.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.425
One wrong pothole...

23:14.426 --> 23:16.092
Mushroom cloud,
got it.
All right, hurry!

23:19.966 --> 23:21.499
Where are you going?

23:21.501 --> 23:23.167
I'm coming.
I feel responsible.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.619
No, you're just
faking guilt

23:24.620 --> 23:26.070
because god knows what you
want to get out of this.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.305
So do what you do best,

23:27.306 --> 23:28.539
walk away while
i clean up your mess.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.174
Be reasonable.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.076
I can help and still
make my 3:00 appointment.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.528
It's a win-win.

23:33.529 --> 23:34.979
Read my lips, you're not
getting in this truck.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.981
Paige, you drive stick?

23:36.983 --> 23:39.884
I told you to
let me teach you.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.021
She's a mother trucker.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.027
Great driving, Veronica.
Slow and steady,

23:50.029 --> 23:51.695
no faster than
25 miles per hour

23:51.697 --> 23:53.531
and we should
get there safe.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.167
Guys, I'm looking
at the city grid online.

23:56.169 --> 23:59.437
There is zero traffic
due to the holiday weekend.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.705
Got clear skies, smooth sailing.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.741
Our cases rarely go this well.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.444
What's that?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.179
A weirdo in a cape
dropped it off.

24:08.181 --> 24:09.613
Kaldor?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.048
Don't know, I wouldn't
let him in.

24:11.050 --> 24:11.782
He was wearing a cape.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.723
"Don't be a clod,
vote for dodd."

24:19.725 --> 24:21.826
You know, I asked him
to get me t-shirts.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.594
Capes are a bad idea.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.629
(Truck rattling)
No...

24:29.502 --> 24:31.285
Veronica:
What's this?

24:31.286 --> 24:33.069
Toby:
Sly, you're route's blocked
by the Thanksgiving day parade.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.972
Sylvester (Over radio):
Impossible.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.474
I know the route perfectly.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.576
They're premiering
the super fun guy balloon.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.077
I'm recording it and everything.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.846
Well, there are barricades
in front of us

24:41.848 --> 24:43.147
that say you sent us
the wrong way.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.982
Well, they must have changed
their route last minute

24:44.984 --> 24:46.717
and forgot to update
the web site.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.751
Well, it's just
a police barricade.

24:47.753 --> 24:48.819
I can go around it.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.954
Wouldn't be
the first time.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.022
They can't drive
through a parade route.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.958
Why not? If this thing
blows up on top of the float

24:53.960 --> 24:56.760
or ten blocks away,
either way the parade's over.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.829
We can get LAPD
to try to clear it,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.898
but you cancel it,
you're gonna get thousands

25:00.900 --> 25:03.267
of spectators simultaneously
leaving the area.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.835
Total gridlock.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.871
We'll never make it
to palos verdes in time.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.506
Cabe:
Sly, find another road.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.874
All side streets
heading south are blocked,

25:09.876 --> 25:11.108
east and west of you.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.676
Okay, then,
we'll take hawthorne.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.578
It goes all
the way around.
Too much added time.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.813
The truck's battery will die,

25:15.814 --> 25:17.047
and with it,
most of Los Angeles.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.884
Hey, we're right next
to the muni golf course.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.019
No cars, no barricades-- we can
drive right through the city.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.654
According to its web site,

25:23.656 --> 25:25.189
it's closed
for the holiday weekend.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.924
There shouldn't be anybody
on the course.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.959
No, it's too dangerous.
We need smooth roads,

25:28.961 --> 25:30.294
not hills, bumps,
and divots.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.929
Boss, I've got this
nuke box hooked up

25:31.931 --> 25:34.031
to a 12.6-volt
direct-current battery.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.699
It's already starting
to heat up,

25:35.701 --> 25:37.067
and the marshmallows
are melting-- we need a plan.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.736
I got it.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.204
We can go over
unpaved roads.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.906
We just need to use
these moving straps.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.108
But they're not flexible.
They have no give.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.043
That's why I'm gonna
build shock absorbers.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.845
Out of what?
Us.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.648
Toby:
We're down to 24 minutes

25:50.650 --> 25:52.082
and counting-- how's it going
back there?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.250
Sylvester (On radio):
Almost done.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.152
Can I help?
Something tells me

25:55.154 --> 25:56.921
a nuclear reactor is
a less-volatile situation

25:56.923 --> 25:58.622
than the one up here.
Can it, Toby.

25:58.624 --> 26:00.891
I kid.
Not really.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.626
Speaking of kids,
how is my grandson?

26:02.628 --> 26:03.827
He's delightful.
None of your business.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.065
I-i mean, it's none
of your business.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.166
I can't wait
to meet him.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.568
What could possibly
make you think

26:10.570 --> 26:12.236
I would ever let you
see my son?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.638
Because you're a kind
and decent person,

26:14.640 --> 26:17.341
and wouldn't deny a boy
his own grandmother.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.909
Watch me.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.981
Mushroom cloud would be nice
right about now.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.817
Hey, Veronica, when I say so,
hit the Greens.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.052
Guys, lift on three.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.120
One, two, three!

26:30.122 --> 26:32.156
(All groaning, straining)

26:32.158 --> 26:34.224
Walter: Okay, good.
Got it. Drive.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.296
Sylvester:
I can imagine that's heavy.
You only have eight minutes,

26:39.298 --> 26:40.364
and then you'll
clear the course

26:40.366 --> 26:41.699
and you'll be on your way.

26:41.701 --> 26:42.866
Just hold on.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.668
All we're doing is holding on.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.070
Get the rig going faster.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.006
No, no, no.
Not faster on soft ground, okay?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.341
We can't risk the volatility.

26:50.343 --> 26:53.010
You want volatility?
Keep letting your side sag.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.378
Man up and lift.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.679
(Thump)

26:55.681 --> 26:56.780
What the hell was that?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.350
What?
(Banging)

26:59.352 --> 27:00.884
Oh, balls.

27:00.886 --> 27:03.187
What do you mean, "oh, balls"?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.789
I mean we're getting
pelted by golf balls!

27:05.791 --> 27:08.359
What? The site said
the course was closed.

27:08.361 --> 27:11.295
The course, not the range.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.735
(Golf balls thumping)
Aah! Geez!

27:17.737 --> 27:19.303
Those jerks are
aiming at us.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.873
I would, too, if I saw
a truck on my driving range.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.010
(Pelting continues)
Toby: Uh, happy,

27:26.012 --> 27:27.311
would it be bad if one
of the wire connectors

27:27.313 --> 27:29.346
you rigged were broken
by a golf ball?

27:29.348 --> 27:30.881
Mushroom-cloud bad.

27:30.883 --> 27:31.915
That's what I thought.

27:31.917 --> 27:33.817
Should I drive faster?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.420
Walter:
No! It's too dangerous.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.755
What is their problem?
It's human nature.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.423
We got balls, clubs,
a moving target,

27:39.425 --> 27:41.692
and frat boys home
on Thanksgiving break.

27:41.694 --> 27:42.893
This is what they do.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.729
Damn it, I guess
I'm doing this.
Doing what?

27:45.731 --> 27:47.297
Becoming a human piñata.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.799
I'm gonna protect
the connector box.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.106
(Shrieking)

27:57.309 --> 28:00.744
Aah! Try to break it
now, jerks!

28:00.746 --> 28:02.379
Ow!

28:02.381 --> 28:04.915
Aah! Ow!

28:04.917 --> 28:07.051
(Toby grunting)

28:07.053 --> 28:08.919
Man, they're really
nailing him.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.055
Kind of wish I could see that.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.990
Just a few more
yards, Toby.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.692
Aah! Ow!

28:14.694 --> 28:18.729
We're off the course now.
You can put the reactor down.

28:20.466 --> 28:21.465
Okay, cabe, carefully.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.834
Gentle.

28:25.805 --> 28:26.937
You okay?

28:26.939 --> 28:29.306
Uh, never worse.

28:29.308 --> 28:32.376
Great. Uh, well,
that shortcut worked.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.244
We'll get to
the film vault on time.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.715
Yeah, but I'm gonna miss
my 3:00 appointment.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.750
You're worried about
one of your crooked meetings

28:39.752 --> 28:41.719
when there's five million
lives on the line?

28:41.721 --> 28:45.189
It's with people who don't
like to be kept waiting.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.826
(Gunshots)
Whoa! What the hell?!

28:48.828 --> 28:49.860
We're being shot at?

28:49.862 --> 28:51.195
They found me.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.430
I don't know how,
but they found me.

28:54.967 --> 28:58.802
Aah!
If a bullet cracks the
cooling pipe, it's over.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.871
Okay, who the hell
are these guys?!

29:00.873 --> 29:03.174
Not waiting around to find out.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.476
Veronica, screw the
25-mile-an-hour limit, floor it!

29:05.478 --> 29:07.911
(Gunfire)

29:07.913 --> 29:09.363
Aah!

29:09.364 --> 29:10.814
Oh, let me guess.
The people shooting at us

29:10.816 --> 29:12.149
are your 3:00.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.851
Good guess.
(Gunshots continue)

29:21.861 --> 29:24.928
(Gunfire)

29:24.930 --> 29:27.297
Sly, you gotta
help us out, man.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.716
We got bullets
raining down on us.

29:28.717 --> 29:30.134
Okay, we are strategizing
an escape plan now.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.836
Ralph, you're a gamer,
what do you see?

29:32.838 --> 29:35.072
Hang a left on beach cove.
I have an idea.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.807
Toby: Quick, turn left.

29:36.809 --> 29:39.209
(Gunfire continues)

29:44.216 --> 29:45.816
What are
these guys after?

29:45.818 --> 29:47.351
They think we're
carrying money.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.354
They're Swiss bankers.
It's a real estate deal.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.289
What Swiss bankers
shoot at people?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.891
O-okay,
they're not Swiss,

29:53.893 --> 29:55.492
but they do have
Swiss bank accounts.

29:55.494 --> 29:58.195
Congratulations, your lying
is gonna get us killed.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.230
(Gunshots)

30:01.400 --> 30:04.067
(Tires screech)
Walter: Aah!

30:04.069 --> 30:05.402
Veronica, you will be
approaching

30:05.404 --> 30:07.204
train tracks very soon--
drive over them.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.505
Ralph, progress report.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.507
I'm almost into
the city's train system.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.910
The tracks are gonna jostle
this thing hard, hold on!

30:12.912 --> 30:15.112
(Gunshots continue)

30:17.116 --> 30:19.049
We're in.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.487
(Railroad crossing bell
clanging)

30:23.489 --> 30:24.822
Whoa!

30:24.824 --> 30:25.989
(Bell clanging)

30:29.395 --> 30:31.161
(Tires screeching)

30:38.904 --> 30:41.538
Oh, yeah!

30:41.540 --> 30:43.273
Nice job, sly,
you nailed 'em!

30:43.275 --> 30:44.374
What the hell, mom?!

30:44.376 --> 30:46.310
I had no idea that
they would resort

30:46.312 --> 30:47.377
to this kind of violence.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.546
Who?
These...

30:49.548 --> 30:51.415
You know what, don't tell me.
You're just gonna lie anyway.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.217
We're gonna get the reactor
to the film vault,

30:53.219 --> 30:55.385
happy's gonna splice its
cooling system into the grid,

30:55.387 --> 30:57.020
and you can walk home.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.956
I am so done with you!

30:58.958 --> 31:00.858
(Alarm sounding)

31:05.331 --> 31:06.964
What now?

31:06.966 --> 31:08.432
Oh, boy.

31:08.434 --> 31:11.034
Uh, there's a GPS
kill switch on the engine.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.337
A GPS what switch?

31:13.339 --> 31:16.073
We've got no battery
to keep our hot box cool.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.574
We're on a countdown
to meltdown.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.860
I'll try and override.

31:19.861 --> 31:22.145
Wait, when you rented
this truck, what did you do?

31:22.147 --> 31:23.981
I said I had
a rented truck.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.316
I never said
i rented a truck.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.919
Someone with a credit card
ending in 3939

31:28.921 --> 31:30.354
rented it, technically.

31:30.356 --> 31:33.090
Great, the credit card company
picked up the fraud,

31:33.092 --> 31:34.591
and the rental place used
the GPS to shut down the truck.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.360
Thanks, mom. If millions
of people die,

31:36.362 --> 31:37.961
it'll be your fault.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.396
How could I know
about GPS switches?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.064
I've been in prison
for six years.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.299
Prison?
Prison?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.368
Prison?
Grandma's a jailbird.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.504
That's your gated community
in Arizona?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.973
Arizona state
penitentiary for women.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.308
It has lots of gates.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.044
Guys, I didn't plan for this

31:54.046 --> 31:56.146
to turn out this way.
You know those...

31:56.148 --> 31:57.381
Those men who were
shooting at us?

31:57.383 --> 31:59.249
I did business with them
a while ago.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.784
I owe them some money,

32:00.785 --> 32:02.318
and when I got out,
i wanted to settle up.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.587
We were supposed to meet

32:03.589 --> 32:05.522
at the factory,
and then I found this

32:05.524 --> 32:09.493
nuclear thing
and things got sidetracked.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.929
I didn't know
how dangerous they were.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.263
They probably went
to the building early

32:13.265 --> 32:15.265
to make sure you weren't
playing any games.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.601
They saw you leave
with us, followed.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.353
Probably thought their money
was on the truck.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.104
Waited until we got far enough
away from the driving range,

32:21.106 --> 32:23.006
no one could see us,
opened fire.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.441
Paige:
Congratulations.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.343
You've graduated to hanging out
with killers.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.378
I'm sorry.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.479
I'm sorry

32:29.481 --> 32:31.248
that things spiraled out
like this.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.318
I'm... sorry I put you
and your friends in danger.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.288
I'm... sorry about today
and every other day

32:38.290 --> 32:41.091
prior to this day.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.460
You don't have a baby and
think that you're gonna end up

32:43.462 --> 32:45.295
a lousy parent.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.197
It's not the plan.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.732
It just happens.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.600
It doesn't just happen.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.369
You allow it to happen.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.137
And I would never allow that
to happen to my child.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.623
I know.

32:56.624 --> 32:59.108
Because you're a better
mother than I could ever be.

32:59.111 --> 33:02.012
I've made
a million mistakes,

33:02.014 --> 33:05.182
but I've never stopped
loving you.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.683
And no matter what
you say to me,

33:06.685 --> 33:09.486
no matter how much you
hate me, I never will.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.255
Happy:
Okay, no go.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.558
They make these switches
complicated for a reason.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.692
We don't have the tools
or the time

33:15.694 --> 33:16.693
for me to get the battery

33:16.695 --> 33:18.395
running again.
Bottom line?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.230
Bottom line?

33:20.232 --> 33:21.465
We've got about nine minutes
until meltdown.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.472
Walt, you got to figure a way
to cool this reactor

33:28.474 --> 33:30.273
without a battery.
Okay, sly,

33:30.275 --> 33:32.175
what's our current distance
from the ocean?

33:32.177 --> 33:33.710
Less than three miles.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.612
Walter:
Okay.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.880
Uh, I know what you're thinking,

33:36.881 --> 33:38.147
but even if we could get it
to the ocean,

33:38.150 --> 33:39.316
liquid metal can't have contact

33:39.318 --> 33:40.717
with water or it'll explode.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.019
And the coolant pipes
are so brittle,

33:42.021 --> 33:43.220
they'll crack in the cold ocean.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.420
So, then we ditch the coolant.
Tim:
How?

33:44.423 --> 33:45.589
You said even the moisture
in the air

33:45.591 --> 33:47.591
could cause it to detonate.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.592
Sodium metal can
be stored in oil.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.093
If you drain the
coolant directly

33:50.095 --> 33:51.561
into oil,
without exposing it to oxygen,

33:51.563 --> 33:54.064
you can safely remove it
before sinking the reactor.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.732
All right, where do
we get that much oil?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.467
Holy cow.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.403
When we were driving away

33:59.405 --> 34:01.438
from the shooters, we drove
so far out of the way

34:01.440 --> 34:03.473
that we circled back around
to the parade route.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.608
So what?

34:04.610 --> 34:06.510
Look.
It's churros!

34:08.113 --> 34:10.247
On behalf of the
unites states government,

34:10.249 --> 34:12.516
I'm commandeering your churro
cart and all its cooking oil.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.421
(Groans)

34:25.497 --> 34:27.130
Walter:
Happy, make sure there's
a vacuum seal.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.499
Happy:
That's the plan.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.400
Tim:
Ready.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.235
Walter:
Hit it, happy.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.237
Sylvester:
How's it looking?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.772
Happy:
Flowing, but we got to drain
the whole system.

34:35.774 --> 34:39.476
And, with no coolant,
this thing is red hot.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.644
We've got less than...
Eight minutes

34:40.646 --> 34:41.812
until another chernobyl.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.647
Toby:
You guys have been to chernobyl.

34:43.649 --> 34:44.781
If I remember correctly,

34:44.783 --> 34:45.715
no one wants to go back there.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.084
Uh, Walter, how do we get this

34:47.086 --> 34:48.218
to the ocean in time?

34:50.222 --> 34:51.521
Super fun guy.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.190

Excuse me.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.466
On behalf of the
United States government,

35:02.468 --> 35:05.569
I'm commandeering this
super fun guy balloon!

35:13.846 --> 35:15.479
Walter:
Helium tank is set.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.582
Isn't this just gonna cause
an environmental disaster

35:18.584 --> 35:19.583
in the ocean?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.135
No, not at all.

35:21.136 --> 35:22.686
Every seven centimeters
the reactor drops,

35:22.688 --> 35:25.288
the radioactivity of
the waste falls by half.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.590
You could be swimming
ten feet away from it

35:26.592 --> 35:28.358
and get no exposure.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.393
It'll be safe until
the department of energy

35:30.395 --> 35:33.196
can pick it up
over the next 24 hours.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.133
Can you give me your cell phone?

35:36.135 --> 35:37.434
Yeah.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.302
I'm gonna put it inside
so they can track

35:39.304 --> 35:41.505
our location exactly.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.506
(Quietly):
Hey, Veronica.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.673
Can I talk to you?

35:44.710 --> 35:47.310
That phone's not
Bluetooth compatible.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.246
So, you pretended you
were talking cantonese

35:49.248 --> 35:51.348
when we came into that
basement, didn't you?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.917
I was just trying
to impress my daughter.

35:53.919 --> 35:57.254
And the... rental truck
for just a few jackhammers?

35:57.256 --> 35:59.489
How much did those
shooters think you had

35:59.491 --> 36:01.925
that you needed a truck?

36:03.896 --> 36:07.631
You're gonna keep me
on my toes, aren't you?

36:07.633 --> 36:08.916
Walter:
Sly.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.200
Give me the numbers?
We are in luck.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.469
Wind speed is ten miles
per hour due west.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.504
You need to puncture the balloon
at a 45-degree angle

36:14.506 --> 36:15.939
to give it some lift! Only...

36:15.941 --> 36:17.641
How are you
going to puncture it?

36:17.643 --> 36:20.944
Kid, it's probably a good thing
you're not here to witness this.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.412
What does that mean?

36:22.414 --> 36:24.548
Super fun guy is gonna
take it in the tokus.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.184
All right.

There is a superhero-shaped

36:42.601 --> 36:44.634
heading towards the pacific.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.369
I think that's the one.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.871
The compressed air is expelling

36:47.873 --> 36:49.639

to have super fun guy

36:49.641 --> 36:51.775
traveling at a rate
of 80 miles per hour.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.378

of two minutes and 15 seconds!
