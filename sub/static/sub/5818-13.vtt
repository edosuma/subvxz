I want to feel pain.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.167
(GRUNTS)

of this miserable life.

(GRUNTING)

00:10.480 --> 00:12.767
What is this about? What did you do?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.241
DAMON: I killed Elena.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.361
- I think these babies are siphons.
- Stefan.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.251
VALERIE: And, I'm afraid
they might be feeding off your blood.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.362
As in, they're literally siphoning
the vampire magic out of your body.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.087
I found this in my mail.
It's warning from Rayna Cruz,

00:28.240 --> 00:30.686
once you've been marked by her sword
she never stops hunting you.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.365
There's no stopping her, ever.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.927
This is your vicious, terrifying
big-bad huntress?

ENZO: I knew if I sent those postcards,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.368
one of the heretics
would lead me right to you.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.571
What is that?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.690
My tattoo you keep asking about.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.045
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:15.280 --> 01:16.566
The Hunter's Mark.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.485
I traced it down to the line.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.649
How come I can't see the real one?

01:23.360 --> 01:27.126
Because, the mark is only visible
to the Brotherhood of the Five.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.966
When do I get mine?

01:29.960 --> 01:31.121
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:35.120 --> 01:36.326
Hopefully, never.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.931
If I do my job right, you will live
in a world without bloodsuckers.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.761
Now get up, I made stew.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.127
No.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.486
I will not eat.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.330
Not until you teach me how to fight.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.002
This should be
about the right size for you.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.366
Don't just look at it.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.326

03:06.880 --> 03:08.291
Let me go with you.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.205
Not today, Nene.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.491
This is my burden.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.844
One day it may be yours.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.371
That is not today.

No. We're dancing.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.841
No. We are done. You, leave, now.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.650
- What are you--
- I'll call you.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.047
I need a drink and a buddy.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.524
And currently
you are my only buddy available to drink.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.162
You'll notice, I'm overlooking the fact
that you nearly killed me

05:32.400 --> 05:33.970
the last time we hung out so...

05:34.120 --> 05:35.565
Thanks for that.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.724
You're out of bourbon?
How is that possible?

Is someone celebrating
Julian's very timely demise?

05:45.280 --> 05:47.647
Stefan didn't tell you?
Put a chair back through his heart.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.364
It's an oldie but a goodie.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.404
Hope he has enough chairs to take out
the rest of Julian's backup dancers.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.886
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they're too debauched

05:56.160 --> 05:57.491
to even notice he's missing.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.362
Anyway, on the subject of
people who've gone missing,

06:00.560 --> 06:02.608
-when was the last time you spoke to Enzo?
_Um__

06:02.840 --> 06:06.606
Because yesterday, I got dragged into
a very bad I Word rerun,

06:06.880 --> 06:09.611

so we could track down Rayna Cruz,

06:09.840 --> 06:12.684
the big scary huntress, who by the way,
turned out to be 80 and senile,

06:12.840 --> 06:16.925
when all of a sudden, Enzo shows up
out of nowhere and steals her corpse.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.930
- What is this?
_Um__

06:27.160 --> 06:29.322
And don't tell me
it belonged to Carol Lockwood.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.121

- Don't be.

-(EXHALES)

07:26.520 --> 07:27.931
What did you tell them?

07:28.960 --> 07:31.850
Oh, I compelled the doctors to ignore
all things medicine couldn't explain.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.771
Good. I compelled the doctor
to shut down this entire wing.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.166
So it's just us.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.810
Didn't want a vampire C-section
to draw too much attention.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.011
Has she regained consciousness?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.001
No, not yet.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.603
I gave her my magic.
I've stopped the desiccation.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.928
I knew she was sick, but I left anyway.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.406
I almost killed her.

And what were you going to do?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.886
Allow Damon to get his head ripped off
in a bloody fight ring?

08:02.160 --> 08:03.207
Your brother needed you.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.041
My brother doesn't care about anyone
or anything.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.003
He made that
exceptionally clear yesterday.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.326
Have you talked to anyone else
about what he did to Elena?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.724

08:21.000 --> 08:22.729

08:24.920 --> 08:26.570
I just couldn't find the words.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.563
Look, right now all you need
to worry about is inside that room.

08:34.919 --> 08:38.207
Caroline's going to have the babies,
everything will be fine,

08:38.679 --> 08:40.169
and all this will be over.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.248

- Got it.

- With a K.
- Krystal, with a K. Hmm.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.731
Sounds like pure class. With a K.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.806
Elena would never do that to us,

09:13.120 --> 09:16.203
which is why, she gave you
very clear instructions to live your life.

for Bonnie. She's not taking my calls.

I'm sorry, she's busy.
I'm gonna have to take a message?

09:46.480 --> 09:50.644
Yeah, I'm looking for Rayna Cruz's sword.
Let's just say that it's beyond urgent.

- Of course he does.

Does Bonnie know what you did to Elena?

10:02.080 --> 10:06.642
How you incinerated your true love while
she slept so soundly inside her casket?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.245
Yeah. I'll take that as a no.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.010
Reckon that's wise.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.367
I imagine if your precious Bonnie
found out

10:14.640 --> 10:17.120
that you gave Elena a Viking funeral,

10:17.640 --> 10:21.565
it'll most certainly shatter that fragile
and somewhat creepy frenemy thing

10:21.880 --> 10:23.291
you two have going on.

Get the sword, bring it to me at Whitmore.

I'm gonna need a huge favor.

I should be there in a few hours.

that magic is in your blood,

enough magic outside of your body

- I will stay and help Valerie.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.406
- Damon needs you.
- I don't care what Damon needs.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.967
I don't know what he did
to make you hate him.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.891
But he is so determined to make things
right, he's gonna get himself killed.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.285
Do you honestly think I would do anything
to put Caroline at risk?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.441
(DAMON GROANS)

33:17.200 --> 33:18.964
What the hell's going on here?

33:22.200 --> 33:24.851
Stefan, go. Ric can take it from here.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.041
(GRUNTING)

33:48.000 --> 33:49.445
(BEEPING STEADILY)

33:50.440 --> 33:51.851
(BOTH CHANTING)

33:54.320 --> 33:56.288
- How are we doing?
- Almost there.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.251
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:05.000 --> 34:06.047
(GROANING)

34:13.719 --> 34:15.609
You wanna send me back to hell?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.681
Well, let me tell you something, lady.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.085
I'm already there.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.005
(GRUNTS)

34:29.880 --> 34:31.005
Oh!

34:31.679 --> 34:32.920
Stefan.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.489
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:42.080 --> 34:43.127
(CHUCKLES)

34:43.320 --> 34:46.051
When I'm with you, I'm happy.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.040
I totally get it
if you wanna run for the hills.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.083
I'm not going anywhere.
Because I love you.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.842
NORA: Once you've been marked.
She'll chase you to the end of the Earth.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.841
(PANTING)

35:09.680 --> 35:11.569
I'll see you, brother.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.126
(BOTH CONTINUE CHANTING)

35:28.200 --> 35:30.680
SURGEON: Okay. Now is our chance.
First baby's ready.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.926
(BABY CRYING)

35:48.600 --> 35:50.728
SURGEON: And now, baby number two.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.886
(BABY CRYING)

36:14.080 --> 36:15.570
Is she okay?

36:18.440 --> 36:19.930
Yes, she's okay.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.121
(CHUCKLES)

36:25.880 --> 36:27.291
They're both okay.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.409
Are you going to untie me?

36:39.480 --> 36:40.527
It's tempting...

36:42.280 --> 36:44.282
The ropes make it easier to kill you.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.449
(LAUGHS) You're gonna kill me?

36:47.200 --> 36:52.286
(SIGHS) Look, I assure you that
giving Rayna Cruz the Phoenix Sword

36:52.600 --> 36:54.967
was not on my list of things to do today.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.926
Really? You know what was on
my list of things to do today?

36:59.840 --> 37:01.490
- Buy more bourbon.
- Mmm.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.727
That was it. That was the
most stressful part of my day.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.847
And then you blackmailed me and
screwed me into this scavenger hunt

37:10.120 --> 37:11.849
and now my brother's paying the price.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.686
- Rayna gave me no choice.
- No choice?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.571
That's an interesting notion.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.520
I tell you what?

37:20.600 --> 37:23.206
Why don't we let fate decide what happens.

37:23.720 --> 37:27.725
Heads, you live. Tails, you don't.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.047
- Elena's alive.
- No, sir, she's not.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.249
I watched her burn with my own eyes.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.642
No, you weren't of sound mind.
You were hallucinating.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.168
You saw what you wanted to see.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.681
Really?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.002
Tyler thought it best to have an empty,
decoy coffin.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.084
So now you and Tyler are the dynamic duo?

37:48.360 --> 37:51.409
Let's just say that
we have mutual friends.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.569
Who have the real coffin
and the real Elena.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.045
Take me to her.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.480
She's in New York.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.242
But my friends are keeping her very safe.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.160
And very much alive.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.966
Good.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.606
(GROANS SOFTLY)

38:19.160 --> 38:20.764
What happened?

38:23.880 --> 38:26.690
- Are they out? Are they okay?
- Everything's fine.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.169
Babies are healthy
and they're with Alaric.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.567
He took them to the nursery
to get them checked out.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.928
- Okay. They're okay.
- They're better than that,

38:34.840 --> 38:36.126
they're beautiful.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.406
(SIGHS)

38:40.320 --> 38:42.004
(CHUCKLES) Where's Stefan?

38:47.440 --> 38:48.487
What happened?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.206
(PHONE RINGING)

38:56.200 --> 38:58.248
- DAMON: Where are you?
- Not where I'm supposed to be.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.482
Which is with my girlfriend,
who just gave birth.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.961
Instead I'm running from a Hunter
who won't stop chasing me,

39:03.120 --> 39:04.360
until she's put down.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.810
- Why did you hand over that sword, Damon?
- Elena's alive.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.961
What are you talking about?

39:10.480 --> 39:12.562
A long story with a hell of a punch line.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.490
I didn't kill her, Stefan.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.291
She's alive.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.725
-(SIGHS)
- I got a second chance, brother.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.486
And I will fix this. I Will.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.407
I will kill that Huntress
with my bare hands if I have to

39:28.640 --> 39:31.007
and I will bring you back here, I promise.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.170
<i>I promise you-</i>

39:33.600 --> 39:35.011
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

39:38.520 --> 39:40.329
Hey, how are you?

39:41.040 --> 39:45.170
Exhausted. Hungry. Lonely.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.011
I'm sorry. I wish I could be there.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.005
- This is the only way I could stop her.
- I know.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.521
(SIGHS)

39:54.720 --> 39:57.405
I just wish
it didn't always have to be you.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.767
I promise, I will come back for you.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.010
(SOBS) Mmm-hmm.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.248
I have to keep moving
if I wanna stay ahead of her.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.326
I love you.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.890
I love you, too.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.966
Oh, my God.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.171
You wanna hold them?

40:31.880 --> 40:34.406
(SIGHS) Are you sure that's okay?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.609
Yeah, Valerie said
it shouldn't be a problem.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.288
Something about the umbilical cord,
I don't know.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.800
I was a little distracted.

40:42.680 --> 40:43.920
(CHUCKLES)

40:45.320 --> 40:46.731
This is Josie...

40:50.600 --> 40:52.090
In honor of their mother.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.925
And this one...

41:05.960 --> 41:07.166
(CHUCKLES)

41:09.080 --> 41:10.286
This is Elizabeth.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.570
In honor of your mother.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.521
JOSIE: Mommy?

41:27.920 --> 41:31.481
- Yeah, I just got on I-20.
- RIC: Okay. Call me when you get there.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.280
- What about Stefan?
- Just go.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.962
Okay. Um, good-bye.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.564
- JOSIE: Mommy...
- Shh...

41:40.840 --> 41:43.525
- Don't wake up your sister.
- Where are we going?

41:44.560 --> 41:48.246
To New Orleans. To visit Mommy's friend.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.321
English - SDH
