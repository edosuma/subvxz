00:38.238 --> 00:40.205
Hi.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.615
Okay.

00:54.154 --> 00:57.556
Turn around.
Okay? Bye.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.126
Turn around.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.530
Okay.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.175
Something to drink?

01:16.177 --> 01:17.676
I... um...

01:18.478 --> 01:21.513
Yeah,
can I have an orange juice?

01:25.618 --> 01:29.154
Actually, um,
can you make that a scotch?

01:30.490 --> 01:31.690
Rocks.

01:32.358 --> 01:34.226
Double.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.462
Oh, that's it.

01:39.499 --> 01:39.498
No.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.469
You know, if you're gonna
have a plain black bag,

01:43.471 --> 01:47.139
you should put something
on it to distinguish it
from the other bags.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.342
I don't know why you needed
a whole suitcase anyway.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.777
We're only there three days.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.314
Well, two days,
three nights.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.318
Well, but I guess
Monday is a travel day,
so technically three days.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.385
Okay.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.621
Here's the thing.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.390
I am the person
who overpacks her things

02:05.392 --> 02:08.594
in an unmarked,
generic black suitcase, okay?

02:08.596 --> 02:12.531
It's who I always have been.
It's who I always will be.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.466
That is what
you're signing up for.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.537
I know. I can't wait
to sign up for you.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.811
Did you have
a drink on the plane?

02:26.412 --> 02:29.214
Just one. I mean...
Oh, that's it.

02:43.830 --> 02:43.829
Who are you texting?

02:45.565 --> 02:48.634
Uh, Annie. Just letting her
know where we are.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.702
You know,
that's a lovely blouse.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.772
This? Thanks.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.841
Your first time
in Savannah?
Yeah.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.309
My family has
a house here from...

02:57.311 --> 02:58.544
Yeah, it's a beautiful city.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.279
I'd love to show you around.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.881
Well, you know,
we're actually staying
an hour out of town, so...

03:02.883 --> 03:04.516
Oh, shame.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.785
You know,
if you'd rather spend
the weekend with Rick,

03:06.787 --> 03:08.320
I would totally get that.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.556
'Cause it seems that
you guys really connected.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.758
Yeah,
i don't know, I think maybe
he was just being friendly.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.859
Lesbians!

03:13.861 --> 03:15.327
Hey.
Hello.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.195
This is where
the subarus are.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.630
Hi.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.465
You love that
Subaru joke, huh?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.967
I love it.
It's my favorite.

03:33.813 --> 03:38.817
Um, so Peter and Ruby get in
in a couple of hours.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.820
Hmm-hmm.
And, Matt,
did you talk to Jack?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.355
Yeah, he's driving.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.325
Probably get in around
the same time as us.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.393
How's he doing?

03:48.595 --> 03:49.761
Well, you know.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.630
Do we know if
he's bringing her?

03:51.764 --> 03:53.632
Uh, he didn't say.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.701
He can't really
bring her, right?

03:55.703 --> 03:56.835
He shouldn't.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.771
He shouldn't bring her.
It's not appropriate.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.674
Fifty bucks says
he brings her.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.009
You're on.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.290
Jess, why have you
never brought me here?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.524
None of us have
been here in what,
six years?

04:20.527 --> 04:20.524
Six years.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.962
I would've come
here without you.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.533
Jessie, this is your family's
little summer house?

04:28.535 --> 04:30.902
It belongs to our
whole family.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.905
What are you, like,
a secret Kennedy
or something?

04:34.407 --> 04:36.275
Seriously, I really think that
we should stay together.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.343
I've been
thinking about it a lot
since we got here

04:38.345 --> 04:40.412
and I really feel like...

04:41.481 --> 04:43.749
Babe. Babe.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.885
I mean, what is this?
This place is perfect.

04:48.521 --> 04:48.520
Does someone live here?

04:48.522 --> 04:52.658
There are people
who take care of it
and get it ready for us.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.926
What, you mean like
oompa-loompas?
Yes.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.997
No way.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.571
I missed this place.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.440
I don't understand
why we're not just
getting married here.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.574
Baby!

05:25.725 --> 05:28.760
Oh! Oh, no!

05:28.762 --> 05:30.962
No!

05:31.698 --> 05:33.065
My friends!

05:36.469 --> 05:37.836
- My friends!
- Hi.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.741
A check is fine,
if that's all you have.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.876
Okay, this is Lola.
Yes.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.779
Annie, Matt, Jessie, Sarah.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.481
This is Lola.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.515
Hello. Hi.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.717
Hi. How are you?

05:51.719 --> 05:52.918
Why not?

05:53.953 --> 05:55.620
Good to see you.
Hi.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.756
How are you?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.558
You guys good?
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.659
We just got here.

06:00.661 --> 06:00.659
How was the drive?
Good.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.762
It's far hotter in that
car than anywhere
else in the universe.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.030
Hot.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.799
Um, Jack,
can we talk to you, please?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.401
We just got here.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.536
Now, right now?
Jessie, can you...

06:11.538 --> 06:11.536
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.872
Sure. Sorry.
I'm good without you.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.940
Over there? Okay.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.007
Yeah, there's a...

06:16.009 --> 06:17.542
What's up?

06:29.989 --> 06:32.057
Can you guys
just give me a break, please?

06:32.059 --> 06:35.093
Well, excuse me,
but this is a very
delicate situation

06:35.095 --> 06:39.498
and I don't think
having some baby
stranger around

06:39.500 --> 06:41.800
is going to
make Peter and Ruby
feel very safe.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.735
We shouldn't
even be doing this
in the first place.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.904
Well, we are doing it.
We all agreed.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.773
Nope. I'm gonna
stop you right there.
I never agreed.

06:47.775 --> 06:47.773
Remember when I was like,

06:47.775 --> 06:47.773
"i absolutely don't
think this is something
we should do"?

06:47.775 --> 06:53.745
Okay.
Well, the majority agreed,
and we are doing it.

06:53.946 --> 06:57.082
This marriage intervention
is long overdue.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.150
Oh, my god.

06:58.152 --> 07:01.019
That sounds even more insane
when you say it out loud.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.521
"Marriage intervention"?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.789
Yeah, it doesn't
sound great.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.957
So, Lola,
where do you live?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.492
Um...

07:07.960 --> 07:09.094
Nowhere.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.930
I kind of just
travel around with Jack.

07:12.565 --> 07:17.002
We met at south by southwest
at my boyfriend's show.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.571
We just, like,
saw each other
and were like...

07:19.573 --> 07:21.940
Just,
like, hit it off really well.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.842
That's cool.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.611
So, Jessie's
your girlfriend.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.480
Exactly. Yeah.
Right. Okay.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.981
How long have you
guys been together?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.116
Three years.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.484
Oh. Three years. Nice.

07:32.752 --> 07:33.985
Where do you guys live?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.554
We live in
Los Angeles.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.522
But, you know, not together.
We don't live together.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.058
Oh, okay.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.660
Why not?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.029
Uh, she's very independent.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.530
Right, right, right.

07:46.732 --> 07:47.799
Hmm.

07:47.801 --> 07:47.799
<i> What do you want</i>
<i> me to do?</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:51.536
Do you want me to
just tell her right now
to go home?

07:51.538 --> 07:52.604
No.
Yeah.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.972
That's extreme.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.607
Okay, fine, no.

07:55.609 --> 07:55.607
Okay,
so you just wanna make me

07:55.609 --> 07:57.709
feel bad for
bringing her along.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.478
Jack, I...

07:59.480 --> 08:01.079
Did you guys ever
think for one second

08:01.081 --> 08:03.782
what it would feel like
for me to come back here?

08:06.619 --> 08:06.618
Listen.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.857
She's kind, she loves me,
and she makes me feel good.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.893
And fuck,
i really need to
feel good right now.

08:14.895 --> 08:19.731
So please, be nice. Okay?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.100
Tell them,
"no fucking way."

08:22.102 --> 08:24.636
No, you're not
getting on the plane

08:24.638 --> 08:26.671
until they make good
on the terms of the contract.

08:27.507 --> 08:27.506
Okay. Listen.

08:27.508 --> 08:32.878
Have faith in yourself.
You're a genius.
I'm gonna leave it at that.

08:34.113 --> 08:37.782
All right.
When I hear from them,
I'm gonna text or e-mail.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.551
All right, good.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.921
Sorry.

08:42.923 --> 08:42.921
No, no,
you know what I love?

08:42.923 --> 08:47.959
I love sitting on
the side of the road
for 30 minutes,

08:47.961 --> 08:49.861
'cause it just gives my ass
a chance to sleep.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.063
Okay. I said
I'm sorry. Okay?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.866
We're going into a dead zone,
and it's an important call.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.101
Obviously, I couldn't risk
getting dropped.

08:56.103 --> 08:56.101
That sounded
really important.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.738
Just because other
people's priorities
are different than yours

08:59.740 --> 09:00.939
doesn't mean
they're not important.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.140
Okay, you know what?
Let's just drop this.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.808
Gladly.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.750
I think we should
do it tonight.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.318
Tonight?

09:14.020 --> 09:15.220
That way they
have the weekend to

09:15.222 --> 09:16.688
process while
they're amongst friends.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.256
Yeah, or it could mess up
the whole weekend.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.725
Well, I'm pretty
sure this whole
weekend's been fucked

09:20.727 --> 09:21.693
before it began, right?

09:21.695 --> 09:22.994
Why are you even here?

09:22.996 --> 09:22.994
Aw, I've been saying
the entire time,
i don't think it's our place.

09:22.996 --> 09:29.868
But since you
insisted on doing this,
i wanted to be here.

09:29.870 --> 09:29.868
Of course it's our place.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.672
Peter has been
your best friend
for 20 years

09:33.674 --> 09:36.775
and Ruby is Jessie's sister
and my mentee.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.109
She's your mentee?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.111
She's always looked up to me.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.581
I think we
should do it tonight
after dinner.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.082
Okay, I haven't seen
him in a long time,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.151
but there's no way
they could be that bad.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.852
I've been
looking forward to this
all week long.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.120
Let's just pretend
to have a good time, okay?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.255
Oh, you mean like
i do at home?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.623
Well, if I'm
being brutally honest,

09:51.625 --> 09:51.623
it's because you can't
fucking move past it.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.726
Okay, let's move
past it. We're done.
Can we do that?

09:54.728 --> 09:55.594
It's done. Okay?

09:55.596 --> 09:56.962
Hi.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.263
Hey!

09:58.265 --> 10:00.265
Sorry, we would've
been here earlier,

10:00.267 --> 10:00.265
but Peter was on
a very important
phone call, so...

10:00.267 --> 10:04.002
Ruby,
what happened to your leg?
Need any help with your bags?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.303
Oh, it's broken,
but it's fine. Yeah.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.605
Hi.
Hi.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.906
I can't believe
you broke your leg.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.007
Did you start
coloring your hair?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.775
No.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.143
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.845
Good to see you.
I'm good, but, oh, my god...

10:13.847 --> 10:15.080
I'm Lola.

10:15.082 --> 10:15.080
Hi. Ruby.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.817
- Nice to see you.
- The house is amazing.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.985
Have you checked
on the kids yet?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.252
We just got here,
Peter, so no.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.787
All right, can we?

10:22.789 --> 10:23.955
'Cause we haven't called
since we landed.

10:23.957 --> 10:23.955
Okay.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.292
Ah, so,
just so everyone knows,
there are delicious drinks

10:27.294 --> 10:30.762
being served just out
in back on the porch, so...

10:30.764 --> 10:32.097
Wanna come have a drink?

10:32.932 --> 10:34.766
Uh, I think we
should settle in first
before we...

10:34.768 --> 10:37.068
Peter, is there anything else
you wanna micromanage?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.203
I'm fine. I am... all right.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.270
I'd just like to
have one drink.

10:39.805 --> 10:39.804
Ah!

10:39.806 --> 10:43.074
Everybody's
grumpy after travel.
It's not a big deal.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.778
No. Jack,
you need to take off
your blinders, okay?

10:46.780 --> 10:46.778
Don't.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.781
Just look at the situation.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.851
Yeah, we're gonna do this.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.054
No, I'm not saying that
i don't think we
should do it at all.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.790
I'm just saying that
with the leg development,

10:58.792 --> 11:00.258
that maybe this is
not the best weekend.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.293
When else are we all
gonna be together?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.995
I mean, we have to do it.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.766
Look, you have to admit,
even after five minutes,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.067
you can feel it.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.237
The oppression,
just the weight,

11:12.239 --> 11:15.807
the burden of
their marital prison.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.941
I mean, it's terrifying.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.743
Yeah, I know, but it's like...

11:19.078 --> 11:21.012
You know the kind
of person who likes

11:21.014 --> 11:22.881
having the mirror
held up to them

11:22.883 --> 11:24.849
so they can better
see the ways in which

11:24.851 --> 11:25.950
they need to improve?
Mmm-hmm.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.952
Ruby is the opposite
of that person.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.087
Mmm-hmm.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.990
I don't know.
I feel very scared.

11:32.224 --> 11:35.193
We can't think
about ourselves right now.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.295
We have to save them.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.231
You can't tell
Jessie I'm smoking.
We quit together.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.233
Like I give a shit.

11:43.704 --> 11:48.840
Today is mine
and Peter's anniversary,
so...

11:49.709 --> 11:50.975
Congratulations.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.877
How many years?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.212
A lot. A lot of years.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.150
Should we do something
tonight to celebrate?

12:01.854 --> 12:03.054
Um, well, no,
'cause that would mean

12:03.056 --> 12:04.189
we would have to
acknowledge it,

12:04.191 --> 12:05.824
and we haven't
acknowledged shit, so...

12:06.926 --> 12:08.793
If we acknowledge
the anniversary,

12:08.795 --> 12:08.793
then we'd have to
acknowledge the fact that

12:08.795 --> 12:13.398
we haven't had sex
in six months, and...

12:14.433 --> 12:15.500
Right.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.170
What's up with this?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.139
Oh, yeah,
i do this again.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.276
Don't give me that look.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.212
It's fine.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.047
It's totally
under control.
Okay.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.782
Not...
Fine.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.751
When did you
start smoking again?

12:33.018 --> 12:34.352
I didn't.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.890
And they really hit it off.
She went like this,
"we really hit it off."

12:38.892 --> 12:40.225
You know what I mean?

12:41.427 --> 12:42.794
Not my type.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.262
Yeah, but she's
Jessie's type.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.832
Ah, come on, please.
What is she, like, 12?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.235
Well, she's early-20s.
That's Jessie's type.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.508
I want to...
I want to... kiss me.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.543
Did you see it coming?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.180
Is that connected back...

13:02.182 --> 13:05.850
So, Pete, um,
do you still lease?

13:05.985 --> 13:07.185
Huh?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.220
Your car?
Yeah.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.322
Cute. Oh, my...
Go like this.
What about 'em?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.957
What?
It's like a little puppy.

13:12.959 --> 13:13.792
You still have
that, um, BMW?

13:13.794 --> 13:14.859
Let me do it to you.

13:14.861 --> 13:14.859
How's the mileage...

13:14.861 --> 13:17.395
I wanna put your entire nose
in my mouth.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.130
I wanna suck everything
out of your nose.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.234
Hey! Hello.
What?

13:23.236 --> 13:28.306
You guys mind
taking this inside
or into traffic?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.942
Okay. I'm gonna
go shower.
No.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.177
You hang out
with your friends.
No!

13:32.179 --> 13:32.177
Yes, go.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.879
- Sorry, Lola, it's not you.
- Don't be sorry.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.481
I just haven't seen this guy
in a long time.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.949
I'll be back.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.818
Give me that.
No.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.952
I'll be back.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.854
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you more.

13:47.960 --> 13:47.959
What the fuck is that?

13:47.961 --> 13:51.329
That is just puppy love.
What, do you forget
what it looks like?

13:51.331 --> 13:55.233
She doesn't make you feel,
like, super-old?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.334
Her?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.169
Like, so old.
She doesn't...

13:58.171 --> 14:00.505
No. Stop.
First of all,
"so old"? No.

14:01.040 --> 14:01.039
Okay.
'Cause we have
everything in common.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.039
There's not something
that goes over her head.

14:01.041 --> 14:05.376
We talk about...
Was <i> Titanic </i> out yet?

14:05.378 --> 14:05.376
When she was born?
Yeah.

14:05.378 --> 14:09.614
No.
But I've explained it to her,
and she knows how it ends.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.120
- Made a cheese plate.
- Ooh!

14:16.122 --> 14:17.622
- That looks yummy.
- So...

14:18.190 --> 14:21.059
So there's...
Where is it? There's Sadie.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.927
Oh!
Oh, my gosh!

14:22.929 --> 14:24.262
In her little dress.
Annie, look at this one.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.397
Oh, cute.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.166
Oh, my god.
Will you send that one to me?

14:28.168 --> 14:29.901
How could you
ever have a bad day

14:29.903 --> 14:31.369
when you get to
look at that face!

14:32.204 --> 14:34.005
You gotta send me
that one.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.141
What is that,
like, a little lion costume?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.343
What're you guys
all looking at?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.477
Looking at Pete
and Ruby's kids.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.945
- Oh, can I see?
- Yeah, look.

14:40.947 --> 14:40.945
Yup, there's Leo.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.882
He's a cute kid.
I can't believe
how big they are.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.050
So cute.
Well, you see them
so infrequently.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.118
You know, when you're
around them all the time,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.519
they don't really
change that much.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.154
How old is that?
Yeah, she has...

14:50.156 --> 14:52.423
Well, Leo is eight,
Sadie's six,

14:52.425 --> 14:54.025
and Stanley's two and a half.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.994
He's almost three.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.563
In six months.
In like half a year.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.032
October's in three months.

15:01.034 --> 15:05.270
Sadie is in October.
Stanley is in January,
so, six months.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.537
He's gonna be three.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.139
Oh.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.441
How 'bout you guys?
When are you
gonna have babies?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.310
I don't know.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.246
Well, we have...
We have to get through
the wedding first.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.614
Right.
So, first things first.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.016
But that's on our list.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.117
Yeah. Of course.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.318
But you gotta...
You know, like,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.519
you don't wanna
wait too long, right,

15:21.521 --> 15:25.056
because they say, like,
after you pass 35,

15:25.058 --> 15:27.058
it's harder to get pregnant.
I've heard that. Yeah.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.127
Ruby. Ruby.
The eggs aren't...

15:30.162 --> 15:31.429
Trust me, take your time.
No, I'm just...

15:31.997 --> 15:33.932
They're a handful.
Thank you.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.999
Hmm.

15:43.976 --> 15:47.478
So, Annie is drinking again.

15:47.947 --> 15:53.017
Well,
she just has a glass or two,
um, you know, some nights.

15:53.585 --> 15:54.652
Um...

15:55.421 --> 15:57.655
But it's nothing
like before.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.557
Um...

16:01.126 --> 16:03.361
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.496
Hey, uh, we haven't got your
"save the date" card yet.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.432
We have to...
We gotta save that date.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.300
Yeah. It's just...

16:10.169 --> 16:13.504
We haven't exactly
decided on what

16:13.506 --> 16:15.273
it's gonna look like.
Mmm-hmm.

16:15.275 --> 16:19.010
So we...
There's a little bit more
decision-making.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.645
Yeah, but the wedding
is in three months,

16:20.647 --> 16:22.113
so shouldn't you
get those in the mail?

16:22.115 --> 16:22.113
I know. I know.

16:22.115 --> 16:22.113
Because people take forever
to respond, you know?

16:22.115 --> 16:26.517
I was gonna ask you,
what happened?

16:26.519 --> 16:26.517
To my leg?
Yeah, what happened?

16:26.519 --> 16:33.391
It was a softball game
and I was walking
down the stairs,

16:33.393 --> 16:35.393
and I had
Stanley and a bunch of,

16:35.395 --> 16:37.295
you know,
snacks and water bottles,

16:37.297 --> 16:39.163
and I just missed a step

16:39.165 --> 16:43.401
and I end up cracking my knee
on the stairs and...

16:43.403 --> 16:44.602
Oh, my god.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.604
Yeah, so, six to eight
weeks on crutches.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.072
Ruby, that's horrible.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.507
Yeah. It's my idea
of a good time.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.075
It's a long time.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.078
Hi.
Hi.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.146
Hey.

16:57.282 --> 16:57.281
We started off big, also.

16:57.283 --> 17:02.253
I'm talking about,
we went to Paris and
Rome and it was amazing.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.288
But after like a month,
i thought to myself,

17:04.290 --> 17:06.290
"you know what country
i really wanna see?

17:07.192 --> 17:07.191
"America."

17:07.193 --> 17:07.191
Don't laugh at me.
No, because think about it.

17:07.193 --> 17:12.497
We've lived in America
our entire lives,
right, the entire time?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.298
Have you once
driven cross-country?
No.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.034
That's a crime.
It's fucking amazing!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.502
You're getting so upset.

17:18.303 --> 17:18.301
She came with me
the second I said it.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.738
I said, "let's get a car,"
and she said, "okay."

17:20.740 --> 17:22.272
So, we got that truck.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.710
And the best part is,
i get to choose where we go.

17:25.712 --> 17:25.710
It just feels so free.
I can...

17:25.712 --> 17:30.181
We can literally say, "okay,
now we wanna go north,"
and just...

17:30.183 --> 17:31.516
We'll just fuckin' go north.
Does it need to be...

17:31.518 --> 17:32.617
You want some?
Here, have some.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.218
Oh, yeah.
I'll show you how.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.653
You gotta come home though,
at some point.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.523
Nah, I can't be in L.A.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.494
It looks like it's
something... look.
Yeah.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.140
Cheers.
Cheers.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.288
Am I right?
No!

18:11.223 --> 18:12.490
...about
the serial killer.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.724
Right.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.295
I think that, like,
very few people set out

18:17.297 --> 18:19.497
to intentionally do something
that they know is wrong.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.765
You know,
when you look at history...
Great.

18:20.767 --> 18:20.765
This is where
she's gonna go on
with her pro-Hitler speech.

18:20.767 --> 18:28.639
Oh, my... I'm not pro-Hitler.
Is that where
this is going?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.276
I'm just... I'm using
him to make a point.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.711
I don't know
if we need to...
No, go on.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.580
Go on, make your Hitler point.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.316
Okay, uh...

18:39.251 --> 18:41.119
Hitler was, um,

18:41.121 --> 18:43.621
doing what he thought
was the right thing.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.156
He truly believed it.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.591
And he thought that
he was doing good.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.794
So does that
mean that he is bad?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.295
Yes.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.563
Yes, it does.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.332
Yeah, he's Hitler.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.400
He's Hitler,
of course, yes, but what...

18:56.402 --> 18:59.403
But what he did was bad,
but he didn't mean to be bad.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.671
He was trying to...

19:00.673 --> 19:00.671
He was trying to be good.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.341
He was probably the most
evil man in the world,

19:03.343 --> 19:04.509
and you're trying to
form an argument...

19:04.511 --> 19:04.509
Hey, you know what, Peter?

19:04.511 --> 19:04.509
Forget it. You're not even
trying to understand, so...

19:04.511 --> 19:09.680
Well, I'm sorry,
i don't understand being
a Nazi sympathizer.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.849
I'm not a Nazi sympathizer.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.384
I am just trying to...
Stop!

19:13.386 --> 19:17.588
Stop being so handsome
in <i> schindler's list,</i>

19:18.423 --> 19:20.324
Ralph fiennes.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.461
Because it makes knowing
who to root for too confusing.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.297
You know, when you...
"Ralph" fiennes,
she means.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.366
Rafe?
"Rafe," yeah.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.468
I know.
I don't know
who told you that.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.240
At least I'm not a racist.

19:37.543 --> 19:37.542
Excuse me?
Who is?

19:37.544 --> 19:41.479
The Harvard racism test
says that you are racist.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.580
Oh, come on.
That is a bullshit test.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.681
Very racist.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.316
It's not
a bullshit test.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.350
"How do you like
them apples?"

19:47.719 --> 19:52.223
It was Matt Damon's line
from <i> good will hunting,</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:55.259
which was the movie
where he went to Harvard.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.397
Take a deep breath
and stop doing that.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.232
Peter,
did you cook the chicken?

20:01.466 --> 20:02.733
I did.
It's really salty.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.202
You guys, I'm very sorry.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.205
For Christ's sake,
i used a dash of salt.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.473
You over-salted.
It's like your calling card.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.509
Well, maybe you just have
an overly-sensitive palate.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.843
Maybe you're
heavy-handed.

20:12.845 --> 20:12.843
I'm sorry,
you know what?

20:12.845 --> 20:17.348
I was doing what i
thought was right,
like your good friend Hitler.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.417
I had an abnormal pap smear.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.818
Oh, no.

20:21.453 --> 20:21.452
Thank you.

20:21.454 --> 20:26.357
Well, they said that, um,
a lot of people have it.
It's hpv.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.626
Oh.
And you know what
the doctor said to me?

20:28.628 --> 20:32.363
That it's actually
not really anything
to worry too much about

20:32.365 --> 20:33.598
and just to keep an eye on it.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.833
So, that made me feel better.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.638
I think you should
just come out with it,
you know?

20:40.640 --> 20:41.739
Just get
straight to the point.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.941
No, no,
we have to ease into this.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.010
No. I think that
Sarah's right.

20:46.411 --> 20:46.410
Yeah.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.280
Jessie, you should
just look at them,

20:49.282 --> 20:50.381
and you just say,

20:50.383 --> 20:53.884
"Peter, Ruby,
fucking get divorced."

20:53.886 --> 20:55.386
That's not
exactly what I meant.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.687
Why do
i have to say it?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.522
Because she's your sister.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.658
Yeah, but this is your plan.
Why don't you say it?

21:00.660 --> 21:02.760
Look, why don't you
guys just both do it?

21:02.762 --> 21:05.263
You mean, like,
play off each other?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.397
Yeah.

21:06.399 --> 21:06.397
Hmm.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.967
Oh, yeah, I see
what you're saying.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.603
I like it.

21:15.407 --> 21:16.774
Let's do this.

21:17.676 --> 21:18.843
All right.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.678
Okay.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.546
Treats for the...
Some treats.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.282
Some drinks.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.317
There you go.
There you go, guys.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.518
- Super strong.
- Thank you.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.453
- Cheers.
- Cheers! Cheers!

21:29.455 --> 21:31.422
Drink. Everybody
take a drink and sip.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.657
- Cheers.
- So...

21:32.659 --> 21:33.758
Right. Yes. Here's...

21:33.760 --> 21:34.825
Yeah.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.830
We think it's time
to just get something out.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.033
Just get it out in the open.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.035
Jessie.

21:44.569 --> 21:48.706
Yeah, um.
Yeah, because, uh, it's...

21:50.475 --> 21:51.342
Um...

21:52.611 --> 21:53.978
We talked and...

21:53.980 --> 21:55.680
Okay, just...

21:56.882 --> 21:57.982
Should I?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.483
Yeah.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.418
Ruby.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.720
And Peter.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.728
We think that
it's for the best

22:10.730 --> 22:14.065
for both of you,
probably for everyone,

22:15.967 --> 22:17.034
if...

22:18.870 --> 22:20.938
If we play charades tonight.

22:21.506 --> 22:21.505
Oh...

22:23.608 --> 22:25.676
I know that <i> apples to apples</i>
was discussed,

22:25.678 --> 22:28.546
but I don't like that game.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.348
I'll play charades. Sure.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.749
It's a big announcement.
Thank you very much.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.584
I love charades.
It'll be fun.
Cool.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.353
What was that?

22:35.355 --> 22:38.656
Well, I panicked.
And you weren't much help.

22:38.658 --> 22:39.724
I was warming up.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.126
Well, I got too warm.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.563
And I think I might
be a little bit drunk.

22:45.565 --> 22:45.563
And I'm so full.

22:45.565 --> 22:49.900
And sometimes Ruby
scares me so much
and I just freaked out.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.803
Okay. Calm down,
calm down, it's fine.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.539
Here, give me these.

22:56.608 --> 22:59.910
We can do it tomorrow
and when you're not so full.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.046
Yeah.
Yeah.

23:02.781 --> 23:03.914
Okay.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.049
Okay.

23:07.652 --> 23:08.853
Annie?

23:09.654 --> 23:10.721
Hmm?

23:11.623 --> 23:13.524
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Hmm.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.761
No.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.635
Just gonna...
No, no. Let's not, honey.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.804
She is super full.
I am going to take...

23:26.806 --> 23:27.938
Can I help?
Thanks, no.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.774
You were too tasty, dinner!

23:29.776 --> 23:31.542
Right!
I'll see you guys
downstairs, okay?

23:31.544 --> 23:32.710
Matt, we're...
No!

23:33.078 --> 23:34.678
He is nice.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.480
See you downstairs.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.585
Hey.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.488
In case you need
to throw up more.

23:45.090 --> 23:45.089
Oh...

23:45.091 --> 23:51.896
Do you think anyone noticed
that I was drunk?

23:52.697 --> 23:55.032
I think they may have had
some idea, yeah.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.500
Shit.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.470
Can I have a hug?

24:02.974 --> 24:07.445
Do y'know?
Something that's always
just really hurt my feelings

24:07.447 --> 24:10.915
is you never tried
to make out with me.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.950
Not even one time.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.152
Sorry.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.589
Fine.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.493
I love you.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.899
Hey.

24:31.703 --> 24:34.939
You know,
I've been with women before.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.541
Jack's cool with it.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.146
Cool.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.017
We should get down there.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.586
Sure. Mmm-hmm.
Charades.

24:53.626 --> 24:53.624
It's like this, I'm just...
I know. I know.

24:53.626 --> 24:53.624
I'm really
concerned about her.
It's out of control.

24:53.626 --> 24:58.195
I mean,
i just don't think that
she should be drinking.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.499
You should stay out of it.
It's... she's an adult.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.168
Well, Matt,
what do you think? I mean,
you're with her every day.

25:05.036 --> 25:05.035
What's...

25:05.037 --> 25:08.005
Well, I think it's
just an isolated thing,

25:08.507 --> 25:09.740
and I wouldn't worry
about it.

25:09.742 --> 25:09.740
But, like, you guys,
you know how it goes,

25:09.742 --> 25:12.977
I mean, she has like
a glass of wine and then
before you know it,

25:12.979 --> 25:15.779
she's like five Martinis in
and she's getting tackled by

25:15.781 --> 25:18.849
the secret service
for trying to kiss
Bill Clinton at a restaurant.

25:19.050 --> 25:22.052
I just... I think that
maybe we should sit
her down tomorrow.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.954
No, no. No, no, no.

25:24.689 --> 25:24.688
She probably
won't even drink tomorrow.

25:24.690 --> 25:28.058
Well,
she shouldn't drink ever,
like at all. She shouldn't...

25:28.060 --> 25:29.660
Just stay out of it.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.895
It is none of your business.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.062
I am.
I'm concerned about her.

25:32.064 --> 25:32.062
So, you're saying

25:32.064 --> 25:37.902
that people should
deal with their own
personal problems,

25:37.904 --> 25:40.571
on their own time,
in their own way,

25:40.573 --> 25:42.540
and other people
should kind of
butt out, right?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.041
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.109
Very interesting.

25:45.111 --> 25:45.109
Can we just play charades?

25:45.111 --> 25:47.945
Yes. Yes.
Okay, fine.
I'll drop it.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.680
But listen,
if I see her drinking again,

25:49.682 --> 25:53.017
I want us to say something.
Okay?

25:57.889 --> 26:00.791
What is it?
Is it a TV show?
Is it a movie?

26:00.793 --> 26:00.791
Is it a movie? Is it a movie?
Is it a movie?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.794
Give me...
Give me a "sounds like."
What does it sound like?

26:03.796 --> 26:04.929
Taking...
Time!

26:04.931 --> 26:06.263
- Ah!
- What was it?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.632
Uh, m-a-s-h?

26:08.833 --> 26:09.934
I don't know
what that is!
Oh, that.

26:09.936 --> 26:09.934
<i> Mash.</i>
It was a...

26:09.936 --> 26:12.903
It was a television show.
What are those
periods behind it?

26:12.905 --> 26:12.903
It was a TV show.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.806
It's a movie, too.
It's a movie.
From when?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.907
A long time ago. Who cares?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.108
All right,
you guys, you guys...

26:18.110 --> 26:19.209
Ruby!

26:19.211 --> 26:21.078
Ready?
Yes.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.282
Okay, okay, okay.

26:25.717 --> 26:26.984
Movie. One word.
Movie.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.185
<i> Psycho.</i>

26:28.587 --> 26:29.653
<i>Big picture.</i>

26:29.921 --> 26:31.722
<i> Jaws!</i>
Yes. Yep.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.590
Yes!

26:32.592 --> 26:34.191
Okay, okay, okay.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.928
Good. Film. Second word.

26:38.129 --> 26:39.997
Hump.
<i> Forrest Gump!</i>

26:40.599 --> 26:42.766
Two words.
First word. The...

26:42.768 --> 26:45.135
Burned. The burned... the...

26:45.137 --> 26:46.804
No, you can't do that.
Hot... the hot...

26:46.806 --> 26:47.938
<i>- The untouchables!</i>
- Peter!

26:47.940 --> 26:49.006
What? How is that...
That's insane.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.109
A monster?
<i> The bear.</i>

26:52.111 --> 26:52.109
Five words.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.079
<i> The unbearable</i>
<i> lightness of being!</i>

26:55.081 --> 26:56.880
No way! No way!

26:56.882 --> 26:58.148
Time's up! Time's up!

26:58.150 --> 26:59.316
No, no!

26:59.318 --> 27:01.185
You were so good.

27:01.686 --> 27:02.786
How many did you get?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.788
This is the team
to be on.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.290
Good.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.825
That was very
impressive. Hey!

27:08.927 --> 27:10.961
Hey, could you
scoot over a little?

27:11.863 --> 27:13.797
Annie, could you
scoot over a little?

27:21.139 --> 27:22.406
Oh, baby.
Hmm?

27:24.009 --> 27:25.242
Look, I can do this.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.744
Oh, my god.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.729
You don't think it's weird
we don't live together?

27:46.665 --> 27:50.768
I don't think it's
weird or not weird.
I think it just is what it is.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.835
Mmm-hmm.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.338
You know,
it's been three years.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.973
You don't think it's
weird at all? Really?

27:55.975 --> 27:57.708
I don't wanna talk about this
right now. Okay?

27:57.710 --> 27:58.809
Well, you never
wanna talk about it.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.943
Do you want me to
fuck you or not?

27:59.945 --> 28:01.011
Yes.

28:17.295 --> 28:18.762
You okay?

28:20.398 --> 28:22.466
Yeah, sorry.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.168
It's okay.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.110
You think...

28:47.325 --> 28:48.959
Is this okay?

28:50.295 --> 28:51.462
Yeah.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.233
Can I ask a question?

28:57.001 --> 28:58.168
Yeah.

28:59.137 --> 29:03.340
Okay.
Ruby said uh,
Lola's your type.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.744
Your type's younger people?

29:07.979 --> 29:09.213
That's what that means,
right?

29:11.149 --> 29:12.483
You are my type.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.954
Okay?

29:16.956 --> 29:19.123
So how young
are we talking?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.158
Good night.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.962
Jessie. I can't have
a conversation with you?

29:26.464 --> 29:28.398
Look, I still want you
to fuck me.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.151
What are you doing?

31:28.153 --> 31:30.187
Where's Sarah?
She's upstairs.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.455
No, no, no!

31:31.457 --> 31:35.425
Jessie, it's okay.

31:35.427 --> 31:39.596
I know you want to.
Nobody has to know.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.006
See? That wasn't so bad.

32:21.205 --> 32:23.173
Morning.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.274
Hey.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.383
Beautiful morning.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.685
It is.

32:37.221 --> 32:38.689
How is everything?

32:39.090 --> 32:40.290
Everything's fine.
I'm fine.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.591
Good.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.994
And you?
How are you doing?

32:43.996 --> 32:45.162
Great.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.034
You know, I really do want to
see you guys more.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.138
How are you
and Sarah doing?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.208
We're doing good.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.710
Can't believe
you haven't fucked
it up yet.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.746
I know, I must be slipping.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.015
Are you bored?

33:07.652 --> 33:09.152
A little.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.192
God, I miss having
the time to feel bored.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.606
Do you have one?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.674
No, I'll take one, though.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.708
Morning.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.110
Morning.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.147
Thank you.
You're welcome.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.482
Morning. Morning.

33:40.351 --> 33:44.221
Good morning!
Who is ready
for some kickball?

33:44.223 --> 33:46.123
Oh, mimosas. Yes.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.658
Can we just...
There was something
i wanted to get out of...

33:48.660 --> 33:50.694
What?
The... your...

33:53.097 --> 33:55.098
Somebody's in a mood.
No drinking.

33:55.366 --> 33:55.365
Don't police me.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.202
Ruby wants to sit you down
because of last night.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.637
That is absurd.

34:01.139 --> 34:01.138
What did you say?

34:01.140 --> 34:05.442
Matt said that it was
an isolated incident
and that you were fine.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.344
Okay.
So what's the problem?

34:07.346 --> 34:09.545
The problem is,
you are one mimosa away from

34:09.547 --> 34:11.715
getting this whole thing
turned around on you.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.150
If you wanna do
the intervention

34:13.152 --> 34:14.317
with them,
you can't drink, okay?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.620
You have to
keep it together.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.422
Do you think i
can't not drink?

34:18.424 --> 34:20.489
I don't really know.
Can you not drink?

34:22.193 --> 34:23.360
The wording is so confusing.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.228
Okay, simple.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.630
No drinking.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.199
Okay?

34:30.202 --> 34:32.268
Fine. Fine.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.603
It's better anyway. Yeah.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.339
I gotta keep my
eyes on the prize.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.774
Um...

34:37.775 --> 34:39.576
Game time is in 10 minutes.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.677
Ten minutes!

34:40.679 --> 34:42.245
So, yes, be ready.

34:42.246 --> 34:42.245
Um...

34:42.246 --> 34:47.684
And Matt and Jessie,
can you please help
me move this, uh, bucket?

34:48.219 --> 34:49.252
Sure.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.387
To the outside.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.623
I guess take that side
and... perfect.
And then we're gonna...

34:53.625 --> 34:54.724
Oh, I gotta lift it.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.566
Here.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.838
Ooh.
I had an epiphany.

35:08.206 --> 35:09.673
I know how to do it,

35:09.675 --> 35:11.608
but we need to
figure out a way to get

35:11.610 --> 35:13.477
Peter and Ruby to
leave for a little while,

35:13.479 --> 35:15.178
so I can fill everyone in.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.114
So, how are we gonna do that?

35:17.116 --> 35:18.715
That wasn't part
of your epiphany?

35:19.784 --> 35:22.385
No, it's not helpful. Okay?

35:22.387 --> 35:25.522
Well, we tell them
we need them to go
get something in town.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.192
That's good.
That's really good.
Okay, what?

35:30.495 --> 35:32.362
Uh, something
for the barbecue?

35:32.364 --> 35:33.563
Okay.
Corn?

35:43.541 --> 35:47.611
Hey, would you two mind,
after the game,
going into town

35:47.613 --> 35:52.382
to get some corn,
corn on the cob, for tonight?

35:52.384 --> 35:53.517
Sure.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.353
Great.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.389
Oh, shit, babe.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.458
Would you go to the kitchen
and grab my sunblock?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.593
Yeah.
Thanks.

36:10.668 --> 36:14.204
You and I are
very similar, Jessie.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.272
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.842
We're both sexual beings.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.577
I mean,
i have had sex, but I...

36:20.579 --> 36:22.312
But it just
makes it hard because

36:22.314 --> 36:25.682
we're never satisfied
with just one
man or one woman.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.551
I don't really
understand what's
happening right now...

36:27.553 --> 36:29.252
Just one kiss.

36:29.254 --> 36:31.488
Just one. Just to
see what it feels like.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.290
No, you'd probably be
very disappointed...

36:33.292 --> 36:35.258
Jesus Christ.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.835
What the fuck was that?

36:46.771 --> 36:48.471
It was nothing.

36:49.607 --> 36:50.907
Let's go play.

36:52.376 --> 36:52.375
Because I think
it's ridiculous

36:52.377 --> 36:55.212
that you won't just move over
to third base, so...

36:55.214 --> 36:56.479
I'm just gonna be
here on first base.

36:56.481 --> 36:57.747
I'm not gonna be
running or anything.

36:57.749 --> 36:57.747
I'll catch the ball
when it comes to me.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.884
How are you
gonna catch the ball
when you can't...

37:00.886 --> 37:02.385
All right, let's go!
Let's go!

37:02.387 --> 37:04.354
How we feeling?

37:07.391 --> 37:11.428
Jack. Pass it to me.
You can do it, Taylor!

37:12.831 --> 37:14.231
Get it!
Oh, shit!

37:14.233 --> 37:15.565
Look out!

37:16.267 --> 37:16.266
Sorry.

37:16.268 --> 37:20.537
It's been a while
since I had any balls
flying at my face, so...

37:20.539 --> 37:21.705
Matt!

37:21.707 --> 37:22.839
Mattie! Mattie!

37:27.378 --> 37:28.845
Here. Here, here, here!

37:29.313 --> 37:29.312
Oh-oh.
Safe.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.515
Why didn't you
just throw it to me?
It's gonna happen all day.

37:32.517 --> 37:33.650
How do you want me
to throw it to you?

37:33.652 --> 37:33.650
I want you
to pass it to me.

37:33.652 --> 37:37.354
We're fine. This is sports.
This is what sports is.

37:37.356 --> 37:37.354
All right, not to brag,

37:37.356 --> 37:42.692
but I was mvp on
the kickball team
at my detention center, so...

37:42.694 --> 37:44.628
Should not
brag about that.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.963
All right,
all right, all right!

37:46.965 --> 37:48.798
Here, here, here!

37:48.800 --> 37:51.534
Right here,
right here, right here!
Right here. Right...

37:51.536 --> 37:52.669
I caught it any...

37:52.671 --> 37:54.537
Will you pass me the ball,
Peter?

37:54.539 --> 37:54.537
If you could catch it,
I'd pass you the ball...

37:54.539 --> 37:54.537
I wanna play too,
so next time just fuckin'
pass me the ball!

37:54.539 --> 37:59.542
You want me to
pass you the ball?
I'll pass you the ball.

37:59.544 --> 38:00.610
Okay.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.545
Ready to rumble.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.987
Oh, my god, Ruby.
Are you okay?

38:14.692 --> 38:16.559
Come on,
let's go back to the house
and get some ice on it.

38:16.561 --> 38:17.761
You all right?
Sorry.

38:17.763 --> 38:18.928
God, Peter.

38:21.599 --> 38:21.598
Are you all right?

38:21.600 --> 38:24.467
It's okay.
We're just gonna
get some ice on it.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.836
Should have a time-out.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.872
I'm sorry.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.512
It might be tricky
to get them to go
on that errand now.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.321
Does it hurt?

38:44.323 --> 38:48.692
No, it just startled me,
more than anything.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.493
So...
Yeah.

39:10.881 --> 39:13.750
So, um, I was wondering

39:13.752 --> 39:17.420
when you were planning on
going into town,

39:18.055 --> 39:20.490
just because,
you know, I wanna know

39:20.658 --> 39:24.761
that we are gonna
have enough time
to prepare all of that corn.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.763
Yeah.
I'll go in a few minutes.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.368
You both have to go.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.771
Yeah. Well, I don't think

39:34.773 --> 39:37.006
Ruby's gonna wanna go with me
anywhere right now.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.443
Peter, listen.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.045
Life is hard.

39:43.647 --> 39:47.450
Making your way in
the world today...

39:49.920 --> 39:51.988
Takes everything you got.

39:52.656 --> 39:54.023
Yup.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.527
Peter, listen.

39:57.728 --> 40:01.631
Take her out,
get her some ice cream,
tell her you're sorry.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.934
'Cause we all know
it was an accident, clearly.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.437
But still,
it was embarrassing for her,

40:07.905 --> 40:10.874
and she could probably use
some time-out. You know?

40:12.710 --> 40:13.777
Thanks.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.047
Hmm.

40:20.718 --> 40:23.653
Hey.
You ready to go to the store?

40:23.655 --> 40:26.122
I don't really feel like
going to the store right now.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.425
All right. Um...

40:28.427 --> 40:31.194
I'm just gonna be outside
if you need anything.

40:40.704 --> 40:44.107
Hey. I'm sorry.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.045
Will you please
come to the store with me?

40:54.820 --> 40:56.519
So, corn? Just corn?

40:56.521 --> 40:58.488
Thank you. Corn for eight.

41:01.826 --> 41:06.896
Okay. Strategy meeting
inside, now.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.005
I really am sorry.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.740
Just stop apologizing.

41:17.742 --> 41:18.875
Because you forgive me?

41:18.877 --> 41:21.778
Just stop apologizing.

41:28.619 --> 41:32.622
On a&e's Emmy
award-winning show,
<i> intervention,</i>

41:32.624 --> 41:32.622
they take an addict,

41:32.624 --> 41:36.159
they tell them
that they're gonna be
part of a documentary...

41:36.161 --> 41:37.494
Okay, okay, okay.
We know how the show works.

41:37.496 --> 41:37.494
Get to the point.

41:37.496 --> 41:42.198
The point is, I think that
we should all write something

41:42.200 --> 41:44.701
saying why we think
they should break up,

41:44.703 --> 41:47.036
and as their closest
friends saying that

41:47.038 --> 41:49.506
we want them to
stop doing something

41:49.508 --> 41:49.506
that's hurting them. And...

41:49.508 --> 41:52.809
No, no.
No, we're not doing that.
What do you mean, "no"?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.777
I actually don't think
this is a terrible idea.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.045
No, you guys heard
Peter last night.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.647
This will not go over well.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.115
I think that it
will go over just fine.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.750
How would you know?

42:00.752 --> 42:02.652
You were passed out
during the whole
conversation.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.786
- Okay, Jack?
- Yeah?

42:03.788 --> 42:06.556
You have now spent
24 hours with them.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.024
Can you honestly
say that you feel

42:08.026 --> 42:09.659
happy about them
being together?

42:09.661 --> 42:09.659
I wouldn't marry her,

42:09.661 --> 42:12.662
but I'm not gonna tell Peter
what he should be doing.

42:12.930 --> 42:15.965
Are you...
You think that
Ruby is the problem?

42:15.967 --> 42:17.066
I'm not saying Ruby...

42:17.068 --> 42:17.066
Can you not see that

42:17.068 --> 42:21.538
Peter is about
as warm as a Russian
gymnastics coach?

42:21.540 --> 42:23.206
Guys,
if we're going to do this,

42:23.208 --> 42:25.975
we need a plan
that doesn't end
in charades.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.243
Oh, charades was
so much fun.

42:27.245 --> 42:28.811
I think the letter
plan is really good.

42:28.813 --> 42:30.813
Let's do the letter thing.
Yeah, I'm with Jessie.

42:30.815 --> 42:32.015
I think it's a good plan.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.082
That's a great idea.

42:33.084 --> 42:33.082
So what I think
we should do

42:33.084 --> 42:36.819
is we should
all start thinking
about what to write,

42:36.821 --> 42:38.555
then we should
write something.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.690
Lola, you should put on,
like, a whole shirt.

42:41.091 --> 42:42.292
Oh, okay.
Okay.

42:42.826 --> 42:43.893
Great.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.910
You gonna
open the car?

43:02.580 --> 43:03.780
I wanna take a walk.

43:05.115 --> 43:06.849
We should get back.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.251
Five minutes.

43:50.027 --> 43:54.697
It's just incredible.
I just love that sound.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.333
Mmm-hmm.

44:02.973 --> 44:04.707
It's been years.

44:16.887 --> 44:17.954
It's our bench.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.093
Come on.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.895
Sit with me.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.196
No, Peter,
what are you doing?

44:27.198 --> 44:28.998
Tell me the story.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.069
You used to love
telling me the story.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.151
This is ridiculous.
It's professional.

44:49.086 --> 44:51.688
Okay,
great, great, great.
This is all wonderful.

44:51.690 --> 44:54.691
Oh! No, no, no.
Actually, actually...

44:54.693 --> 44:57.093
No, I don't know
if we should have alcohol.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.862
Okay, one glass of wine.
Just one glass of wine.

44:59.864 --> 45:00.797
Annie.

45:03.901 --> 45:06.235
That was a mistake.
That was a mistake.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.137
- I'm just sweating so much.
- Take a breath.

45:08.139 --> 45:09.305
Calm down. It's gonna be okay.
They're here!

45:09.307 --> 45:11.774
What? Okay. Okay.

45:12.810 --> 45:12.809
Um...

45:14.344 --> 45:16.979
Thank you, Matt.
You did a great job.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.981
Okay, Jessie,
take your position.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.283
Where is... okay. Okay.
Next to me. Up.

45:20.285 --> 45:21.951
And... next to me.
Your position is next to me.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.052
Yup.

45:23.821 --> 45:24.887
Here we go.

45:43.140 --> 45:44.273
What's this?

45:44.275 --> 45:46.476
Would you guys
please take a seat?

45:49.379 --> 45:50.747
What's...

45:51.081 --> 45:52.148
We got the corn.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.050
Thank you.

46:00.924 --> 46:01.991
Ruby.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.927
Ruby, Peter...

46:04.929 --> 46:05.795
Um...

46:06.997 --> 46:10.433
Before we all got here,
we talked.

46:11.101 --> 46:12.168
We...

46:12.170 --> 46:13.236
Um...

46:13.238 --> 46:17.240
The people in this room
who are not you two.

46:17.875 --> 46:21.511
Not Lola, because she's new,
but just the five of us.

46:22.045 --> 46:25.081
Part of the reason
that we wanted to come here

46:25.083 --> 46:28.317
was to talk with you.

46:29.353 --> 46:30.887
Um, because we...

46:33.056 --> 46:39.796
We, uh, wanted to
bring something up.

46:41.064 --> 46:44.200
It might come like...
It might sound weird...

46:44.202 --> 46:45.301
But maybe it would be good.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.335
And it really could be good.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.805
Okay, what could be good?

46:49.339 --> 46:51.240
- Uh, so bad.
- It's okay.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.308
Um...

46:56.947 --> 46:59.882
Scientists
believe that, um...

47:01.418 --> 47:02.485
As...

47:03.020 --> 47:06.389
As man began to
walk on two legs,

47:06.391 --> 47:09.425
the burden on the mother
was increased.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.094
Uh, because they were
no longer able to

47:12.096 --> 47:14.130
just carry their
young on their back

47:14.132 --> 47:16.065
and go on with
their daily lives.

47:16.067 --> 47:18.301
You know, they needed help.

47:19.002 --> 47:22.371
Thus the need for a partner,
a husband,

47:22.373 --> 47:23.539
if you will, arose.

47:23.541 --> 47:24.874
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

47:26.143 --> 47:27.276
What do you think?
Maybe you should...

47:27.278 --> 47:28.578
Just read the letter.

47:29.112 --> 47:30.546
Just gonna read the letter.

47:36.019 --> 47:39.121
"Ruby, I've known
you for my whole life.

47:39.123 --> 47:40.923
"You are like my sister.

47:41.458 --> 47:43.860
"Peter,
you are like the brother
i never had.

47:43.862 --> 47:47.864
"But not like
the brother I have because
he and I are not close.

47:47.866 --> 47:49.265
"I love you both very much.

47:49.267 --> 47:51.100
"And, as your friend,
i can't stand by

47:51.102 --> 47:53.035
"and watch you
suffer without saying..."

47:53.037 --> 47:55.071
Okay, what is happening?
What's happening?

47:58.175 --> 47:59.342
"I remember a time..."

47:59.344 --> 48:01.277
They think you
should get divorced.

48:11.154 --> 48:15.258
What?
They think that
you two should get divorced.

48:17.027 --> 48:18.895
We just feel like
you guys are unhappy.

48:18.897 --> 48:21.898
Hold on.
So... so let me get
this straight.

48:21.900 --> 48:25.935
You all got together
and talked about our marriage.

48:25.937 --> 48:28.304
No. No.
We didn't get together.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.306
It was phone
calls and texts and...

48:30.308 --> 48:31.941
Well, our marriage
is none of your business.

48:31.943 --> 48:31.941
Listen, listen.

48:31.943 --> 48:35.244
Man, we're just
trying to help you.
Both of you.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.213
- You wanna help?
- Yeah.

48:37.215 --> 48:41.217
Annie's, Annie's, postponed
your wedding four times?

48:42.185 --> 48:44.053
Did you ever give
that one some thought?

48:44.055 --> 48:45.321
Like any of you
are fuckin' perfect.

48:45.323 --> 48:46.923
All right,
Peter, come on, man.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.190
And you?

48:48.192 --> 48:49.625
You're running all
over the fuckin' planet

48:49.627 --> 48:51.394
with a goddamn art student,

48:51.396 --> 48:53.329
afraid of something
you're not even man
enough to face.

48:53.331 --> 48:53.329
And then you wanna
talk about our marriage?

48:53.331 --> 48:57.500
Peter, I think that maybe
if you just calm
down and listen...

48:57.502 --> 49:00.236
"Calm down"? And you.
The fact that you,
of all people,

49:00.238 --> 49:03.572
think you have any
business giving anyone
relationship advice

49:03.574 --> 49:03.572
is just hilarious.

49:03.574 --> 49:07.343
Sarah's the first
person you've been with
who could rent a car.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.011
Peter, you gotta calm
the fuck down.

49:09.013 --> 49:10.947
I need to calm down?
Yes, you have to
calm the fuck down!

49:10.949 --> 49:12.214
"Calm the fuck down"?
Calm the fuck down, yes!

49:12.216 --> 49:12.214
You're gonna defend her?

49:12.216 --> 49:15.117
Would you still
defend her if you knew
i walked in on her

49:15.119 --> 49:16.519
making out with Lola earlier?

49:16.521 --> 49:18.387
And you wanna talk
about our marriage?

49:18.389 --> 49:19.555
That is not true.

49:20.357 --> 49:22.591
Can you fucking
believe this?

49:25.095 --> 49:26.228
Ruby.

49:29.032 --> 49:30.433
I'm alone in this?

49:31.335 --> 49:33.269
Fuck this.

49:41.278 --> 49:42.445
It...

49:44.581 --> 49:45.715
Babe.

49:47.384 --> 49:48.484
It...

49:52.322 --> 49:54.390
Ruby...
Don't.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.676
This is kind of
worst-case scenario
right now, huh?

50:25.188 --> 50:28.491
He made some
interesting points.

50:42.205 --> 50:43.305
I'm gonna tell
you what happened.

50:43.307 --> 50:44.573
Babe, will you please stop?

50:44.575 --> 50:45.775
What?

50:47.310 --> 50:48.644
She kissed me, okay?
Peter said

50:48.646 --> 50:50.379
that you were making out.
No!

50:50.580 --> 50:53.416
She kissed me.
Peter walked in.
It stopped.

50:54.451 --> 50:56.285
So Peter walking in
is actually why it stopped?

50:56.287 --> 50:57.586
No. No.

50:57.588 --> 50:59.688
Peter walking in
was basically instantaneous.

50:59.690 --> 51:01.490
I would have stopped her.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.392
I guess we'll
just never know, huh?

51:19.643 --> 51:22.545
Are you upset?

51:24.081 --> 51:25.181
No.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.584
Kind of.
It's a little bit weird.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.254
Yeah.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.194
We always said
we would...

51:38.196 --> 51:40.496
We just wanted
to have fun together, right?

51:40.498 --> 51:42.465
Until it stopped being fun?

51:42.467 --> 51:47.236
Nothing too heavy,
nothing too serious.

51:50.740 --> 51:52.408
Could be
somethin' serious.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.450
I'm 22.

52:05.355 --> 52:07.823
Right. Right.

52:18.435 --> 52:18.434
Hey.

52:21.304 --> 52:24.607
Do you wanna come out
and have a drink?

52:39.156 --> 52:41.157
Can I do anything?

52:41.159 --> 52:44.693
You can get your hand
off me before I break
your fuckin' wrist.

52:50.667 --> 52:52.368
I'll come back.

53:22.566 --> 53:23.666
Okay, stop, dude.

53:23.668 --> 53:24.833
It's not... that's fine.

53:26.236 --> 53:27.369
Oh! God.

53:29.339 --> 53:30.873
If you could watch a video
of what happened,

53:30.875 --> 53:32.608
you would not be this upset!

53:32.610 --> 53:34.276
Did you wanna kiss her?

53:34.878 --> 53:37.680
The whole thing caught me
completely off-guard.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.215
You know I have
terrible reflexes.

53:39.217 --> 53:41.350
Did you want to kiss her?

53:41.352 --> 53:44.386
Did I wanna kiss her? No.

53:44.388 --> 53:47.923
But did it feel
fun and exciting
and dangerous

53:47.925 --> 53:50.459
to get that kind of attention
from some cute, young girl,

53:50.461 --> 53:52.561
and did I like that? Yes.

53:52.796 --> 53:54.663
I really can't
believe this, Jess.

53:54.665 --> 53:58.634
Okay, so when the fucking
rental car guy is
flirting with you,

53:58.636 --> 54:02.371
batting his eyelashes at you,
there is zero part
of you that likes it?

54:02.373 --> 54:03.572
There's no part
of you that gets

54:03.574 --> 54:04.773
just like
a little bit excited?

54:04.775 --> 54:06.609
No, Jess. No. Okay?

54:06.611 --> 54:09.845
Because I'm in love with you.
So I don't care.

54:09.847 --> 54:11.480
Well, aren't you
fuckin' perfect, then.

54:11.482 --> 54:14.250
Yeah, you're just
sittin' up there on
your high horse,

54:14.252 --> 54:15.751
so much better
than everybody else.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.653
You never have
an impure thought or feeling.

54:17.655 --> 54:20.823
Just fuckin' saints...
I miss sleeping with men.

54:22.559 --> 54:23.792
Excuse me?

54:23.794 --> 54:26.328
Yeah, I do.
I do. I miss it.

54:27.330 --> 54:31.267
I think about it when you're
fucking me with a strap-on,
like, every time.

54:31.269 --> 54:34.737
And you know how I always
say, like, "i can't tell
the difference"?

54:34.739 --> 54:36.338
Well, I can.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.641
It's not as good.

54:40.343 --> 54:41.477
Jess!

54:46.650 --> 54:48.917
Maybe I should go
and try to talk to
Ruby again.

54:49.552 --> 54:51.487
Just leave her alone.

54:51.821 --> 54:51.820
What about Peter?

54:51.822 --> 54:55.991
Should we try to find him?
It's gonna be dark soon.

54:55.993 --> 54:57.893
No. Let him cool off.

54:58.428 --> 55:00.829
If he's not back after dinner,
we'll go look
for him, all right?

55:02.565 --> 55:04.500
This is all my fault.

55:05.435 --> 55:09.405
Except for
the Jessie-Sarah thing.
Lola, that's kind of on you.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.715
I'm taking a shower.
I'm gonna take a shower!

55:19.717 --> 55:20.849
Over my dead body!

55:22.585 --> 55:23.752
Get out!

55:23.754 --> 55:25.788
Get out! I'm taking a shower!

55:28.692 --> 55:31.627
I'm in here.
Excuse me,
I'm in here right now.

55:31.629 --> 55:32.728
I am also in here now!

55:32.730 --> 55:32.728
I am in here. I'm in here.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.565
Can you not see
that this is crazy?

55:36.567 --> 55:38.667
Don't call me crazy!
These are my feelings.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.836
What do you want?
Do you wanna go kiss Jack?

55:40.838 --> 55:42.071
Would that make
you feel better?

55:43.907 --> 55:45.841
I was being facetious!

55:52.549 --> 55:53.749
Guess we're even.

55:53.751 --> 55:55.451
You swallowed his
whole face.

55:55.453 --> 55:57.019
I liked it.

56:01.758 --> 56:03.492
Am I having a stroke?

56:03.494 --> 56:05.494
Should we do something?

56:05.496 --> 56:06.562
What do you mean, like kiss?

56:06.564 --> 56:07.663
No.

56:07.665 --> 56:08.831
Are you done?

56:09.899 --> 56:11.367
Hey.

56:11.369 --> 56:12.768
No. There's really...

56:12.770 --> 56:14.803
No, no, no. No, no, no.

56:14.805 --> 56:18.707
Stop this! Stop!
That is enough!
That is enough!

56:24.514 --> 56:26.882
You are both
acting like animals.

56:26.884 --> 56:27.983
You are better than this.

56:27.985 --> 56:29.551
No, one of us is.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.452
Oh, cut the shit!

56:30.920 --> 56:32.521
Lola? Jessie?

56:32.523 --> 56:32.521
Yeah?

56:32.523 --> 56:35.391
Do the two of you
want to run off together?

56:35.393 --> 56:36.658
I didn't do anything...

56:36.660 --> 56:37.860
Can you just
answer my question?

56:38.695 --> 56:39.928
No.
No.

56:39.930 --> 56:40.996
No.
No.

56:41.664 --> 56:41.663
Sarah,

56:41.665 --> 56:46.101
do you wanna
break up with Jessie
about this nonsense?

56:47.704 --> 56:48.771
No.

56:48.773 --> 56:52.007
Jessie, whatever
you did or did not do,

56:52.409 --> 56:53.976
you did or did not do enough

56:53.978 --> 56:56.645
to allow Lola's face
to get close
enough to your face

56:56.647 --> 56:58.580
to even make this
a conversation at all.

56:58.582 --> 57:02.151
Lola, take this as a lesson.
No one likes a Jolene.

57:02.819 --> 57:06.555
Sarah, I understand
that you are upset.

57:06.557 --> 57:10.793
I would not be
thrilled about this either.
But Jessie loves you.

57:10.795 --> 57:13.896
She's a good person.
And you know that.

57:14.564 --> 57:17.666
We are all under
a lot of stress,

57:17.867 --> 57:20.102
so let's just sit down,

57:20.104 --> 57:22.571
drink some of that
incredible chardonnay

57:22.573 --> 57:25.741
and calm the fuck down.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.609
Okay?

57:54.771 --> 57:57.473
We should probably
go look for Pete.

57:59.976 --> 58:01.610
Matt... all right.
Sorry.

58:01.612 --> 58:02.878
We should split up, okay?

58:02.880 --> 58:04.012
Okay.
If you find him, call.

58:04.014 --> 58:05.614
Split up?
Yes.

58:05.616 --> 58:07.616
All right.
See you, guys.
I'm gonna go this way.

58:07.618 --> 58:08.984
Okay, I'll go this way.

58:08.986 --> 58:10.619
Well, Jessie, you probably
don't wanna go alone.

58:10.621 --> 58:11.820
'Cause of the dark.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.156
I'll be fine.

58:14.158 --> 58:18.026
But you probably would
be more comfortable if i
came with you. Right?

58:18.028 --> 58:19.761
Would you be
more comfortable?

58:19.763 --> 58:22.898
I mean,
if that's what you need.

58:23.900 --> 58:25.167
Let's go.

58:32.976 --> 58:34.109
Hey.

58:36.679 --> 58:37.946
Do you want any help?

58:38.915 --> 58:40.249
Sure.

58:57.700 --> 58:59.735
She didn't kiss me back.

59:01.938 --> 59:05.040
I know it doesn't
make it any better,
but I'm sorry.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.047
It's okay.

59:22.792 --> 59:24.726
Am I the first
girl Jack's dated

59:24.728 --> 59:26.628
since him and his
wife got divorced?

59:28.831 --> 59:30.332
They didn't get divorced.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.336
Mary died a year
and a half ago.

59:36.005 --> 59:38.807
But, yes,
you're the first person
that he's dated since.

59:40.977 --> 59:42.044
Hmm.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:08.003
I'll come out
if you promise not
to talk about it.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:12.641
I promise to not talk
about anything you want.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.819
Petey.

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.253
Peter!

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.626
I should've probably
tried to stop
this whole thing.

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.761
I really don't
think you could have.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.162
No, I guess not.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:37.766
Once the Annie-train
starts rollin' along,

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:40.135
it's kind of hard to stop.

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.016
I already started today, so...

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:09.998
Who's that?

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:52.107
You know, two weeks before
we found out Mary was sick,

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:55.177
she told me she
wanted a divorce.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:04.419
And we met with a lawyer,
we started the whole process.

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:07.155
I knew she
wanted me to fight it.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:08.890
I didn't want to.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.763
Thought it'd be
easier just for us
to go our separate ways.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:21.870
And then
the second we found out
she was sick,

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.939
everything changed.

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.943
In an instant,
all that resentment

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:31.179
and all that venom and anger
we had toward each other,

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.081
it just disappeared.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.484
Right, and there we were...

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:41.389
The same two people
who fell in love
10 years earlier.

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:48.296
It was so crushing
to watch her go through that,

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.101
but, you know, it was
the best year of our marriage.

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:59.241
And then, she was gone.

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.417
You know,
it took something devastating

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:12.988
for me to figure out
what I had right
in front of me.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.933
Well, are you
gonna do like a buffet

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:26.968
style or a table service,
because...

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:26.968
- Oh, I don't...
- I like a buffet.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:26.968
No, it's unsanitary.
It's unsanitary.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:31.907
Yeah, but then
everybody can just pick
what they want, you know,

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:33.141
and the food
doesn't get as cold.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:33.141
Haven't really...

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:36.945
What about kids?
Are there kids invited?
Yeah.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:38.480
I mean, I guess it depends
how many people, right?

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.815
Right.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:41.149
How many people
are you thinking?

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.218
I'm not sure.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.886
You found
the dress yet?

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.488
There are
versions of it, yeah.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.390
What about the cake?
What are you
doing about the cake?

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:49.958
We don't really know.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.394
Well, you have to order it in,
like, months in advance.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:54.396
I'm really good
with any of this stuff
if you need help, Annie.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:57.866
It's just, you know,
Matt is doing everything,

01:03:57.868 --> 01:04:00.001
so he's been like a godsend.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.369
Have you picked your song?
Your wedding song?

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:05.006
Speaking of Matt,
um, where are they?

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.408
Because it's...

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.143
Oh. Whew.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.213
Speak of the devils.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:12.514
Hi, guys.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.262
I'm sorry.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.100
Would you guys mind?

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.436
No. No.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.004
Yeah.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.278
You agree with them?

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.453
I won't let it get messy.

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:02.057
I'm sorry i
don't have a penis.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:05.560
I'm sorry I'm so old.

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:17.973
You know,
as long as we're hangin' out,

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.607
havin' fun,

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:23.511
I don't have to
kiss anybody else.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.281
Hey. Wake up.
Hmm.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:03.685
I made blueberry pancakes.
Come on. Come on.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.227
Morning.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:16.231
There's some fresh coffee
and a spread of
whatever you like.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.199
What do you think
is happening here?

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.501
I think he's lost it.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:22.070
What are you guys
waiting for?

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:23.271
- Come on, eat.
- Hi.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:24.472
Morning.
Hey.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:25.740
Eat, please.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.642
What smells so good?
Hi.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.779
I also made muffins.
They should be done...

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.414
Uh, from scratch?

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.481
...in about two minutes. Yes.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.749
Peter, are you okay?

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.184
Yeah.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.820
There she is.

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.257
Yeah.

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.292
Good morning.

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.095
Okay, now that
everyone is here,

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.297
I would like to fill you in
on today's schedule.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.232
I was thinking last night,

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.702
I realized that
every time we come here,
we go out on the boat.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.304
It's pretty much
the best part of the trip.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:57.839
And we haven't
been on the boat yet.

01:07:57.841 --> 01:08:01.776
Hmm? So everyone eat,
get dressed, and in one
hour we will depart.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:04.612
A day on the water.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.281
Everybody in?

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.349
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.085
I love boats.

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:11.286
Excellent.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.154
I'm gonna finish making lunch.
Everybody eat.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.423
And the muffins
are coming right up.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.866
Five minutes!

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.109
I feel concerned.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:36.578
- He's fine.
- Hey!

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.147
Fine-adjacent.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.116
Listen, do me a favor.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:44.219
Google "how to tell if
someone's having
a psychotic break."

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.286
Annie.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.287
Woo! You guys not
hear the bell?

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.323
Yeah.
Rally the troop! Let's go!
Come on.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.259
Come on. Come on.
We're gonna...

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:52.594
Listen. I think he is...
No, he's not.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.328
What's going on?
You guys not hear me?

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.397
Let's get goin'.
Yeah.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:00.401
For the record,
this is turning off

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.636
and it's staying here.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:05.807
Hi!

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.308
Why aren't you dressed?

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.277
I'm not going, Peter.
What?

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.679
No. Come on. We're all
gonna get going.
We'll wait for you.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.348
I'm not going.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:18.185
Ruby, you have to come.
It's a tradition.

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:21.389
You can't just
change tradition.
You can't just walk away.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.359
Look, hey, Ruby.
You spend years

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:26.560
building these things, right,
and they mean something.

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:28.162
You can't just walk
away without even...

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:29.663
Jesus fucking Christ,
Peter, just stop!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.299
Stop what?

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:33.768
Stop it, all of this,
all of this fucking bullshit!

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.203
The fucking boats,
the sandwiches!

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:37.671
Just stop it!

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:38.305
I'm sorry, I...

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:41.542
I was just trying
to do something nice.
It's too late.

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:42.877
It's just way too
fucking late. Okay?

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:44.412
It's not too late.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:47.515
You need to just let go!

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.453
So, that's it,
you made up your mind,
you're just gonna walk away...

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.221
You'll leave it
all behind, right,
the family, everybody?

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:56.324
You gave up years ago.
And you didn't?

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.326
Look, I'm not saying
that I'm innocent here.

01:09:58.328 --> 01:09:59.594
We've been hurting
each other for years.

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:01.329
But just think
about it, Peter.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.597
When was
the last time you even

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:04.265
remember feeling
in love with me?

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.234
Last night.

01:10:06.236 --> 01:10:07.335
Last night?
Yeah.

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:08.670
Okay, and before then?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.473
I don't... please.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:13.541
Exactly.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.611
There's nothing here, Peter.
There's nothing.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:17.712
That's not true!

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.614
That can't be true.
Come on, Ruby.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:20.915
I'm done. I can't.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:20.915
Please!
You have to listen to me!

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:24.252
There are some things
that are worth fighting for,

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:26.487
and I'm asking you
if you will
fight for it with me.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:27.755
I need you to go, okay?
I need you to leave.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.357
Come on. Please.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.858
Come on, Ruby. Please!
I need you to leave.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.495
Just fucking leave, okay?
Just get the fuck outta here!

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.676
Don't fucking
touch me, Jessie.
Go away.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.279
Get the fuck out!

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:55.316
Get out!
Get out! Get outta here!

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:00.855
Now what?

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.268
Don't you think
we should go check on her?

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.335
No.
No.

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.307
I think I'm gonna
go up there.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:20.808
Annie, don't.

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:22.944
See what's happening.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:31.653
I was just coming
to see if, you know,
if there was any...

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:36.991
She threw peaches at me.

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.393
Peaches.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.628
So, I think one
of you should try.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.430
Actually, no.
No, thanks.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:43.564
Guys...

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:45.433
What?
I could go talk to her.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.635
Lola, no, no, no.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.736
Why?

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:49.804
Yes.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:53.775
Yes. Actually, I think
that would be perfect.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:56.744
'Cause Ruby would never throw
peaches at someone
she doesn't know.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:57.645
That would be unladylike.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.781
You shouldn't get in
the middle of this.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.382
It's okay. I can do it.

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.892
Guard your face.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:30.778
Is it cool if I sit down?

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.765
So, do you
wanna break up
with your husband?

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.703
Why would I talk to you?

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.374
I don't know.

01:13:13.455 --> 01:13:15.556
It's been so bad for so long.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:22.597
I just let go of the idea
that we'd ever be good again.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:28.002
It will be easier
just to end it, but I...

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.006
But I don't want to.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.910
And I'm so mad at
myself that I don't,
but I...

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:39.747
But I don't.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.049
So, don't.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.422
But what if we try
and it doesn't work?

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:51.859
Well, maybe you'd regret
not trying more.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:57.832
What if we can't get back
to where we were?

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:04.839
Well, maybe
you could make something new.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:16.651
<i> Hi,</i>
<i> you've reached Peter's cell.</i>
<i> Leave a message after...</i>

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.979
We'd just finished lunch.

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.849
We were supposed
to go back to the house

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:51.819
because my dad was
going to take you fishing.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:56.691
And you asked me
to go for a walk.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.895
You seemed so nervous.
I thought it was because

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.997
you were scared
to be alone
with my dad, but...

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:06.534
I wanted to be alone
with you for just
a few more minutes.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:11.606
So, we went for a walk
and we came here.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:13.508
We sat on this bench.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.981
I remember thinking,
"i never thought i
could be so in love."

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:26.988
And then you got on your knee
and took out the ring

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.756
and asked me to marry you.

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:35.596
I started crying
and I couldn't speak,
i was crying so much.

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:39.967
And I just nodded,
and I nodded,
and I jumped in your arms.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:46.874
And we just...
We sat on this bench
laughing and crying

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:51.579
and holding each
other for hours.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.086
It was the happiest day
of my life.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.726
All of my happiest days
have been with you.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.863
I still love you,
but I...

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:11.966
But I'm not happy.

01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:13.901
And I know that
you're not either.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:17.104
And I'm so sorry.

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:18.172
I'm...

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.709
And I don't know, Peter,

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.612
I don't know if we can...
If we can fix it.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.851
But I wanna try.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.658
Will you try with me?

01:16:55.143 --> 01:17:00.281
Nothing. Why won't they
just call or text or
tweet or something?

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:00.281
Don't they know
this is killing me?

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:04.852
Yeah, I mean it's really
rude they're not
considering you in all this.

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:22.637
Guys, I'm so sorry.
I think that...

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:25.239
You don't have to apologize,
okay?

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.374
You guys were right.

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:29.310
Oh, god.

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.848
You poor things.

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:36.283
How are you
gonna tell the kids?

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.887
Well, we're not.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.288
You'll just move
out in the night?

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:42.390
No.

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:47.261
Nobody's moving out.
We're... we are gonna
work things out.

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:48.796
Oh, yay!

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.000
You're staying together?

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:54.969
Yeah.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:57.905
No.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:02.109
No. No.

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:06.847
No, no, no, you weren't
supposed to stay together.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.350
You were supposed
to get divorced.

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:10.718
Yeah, but we don't want to.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:10.718
Yes, you do.

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:16.390
You're trapped
inside this endless chapter

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.761
of torment and misery
and this was your way out.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:22.163
Take it.

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.300
This is a disaster!

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:30.838
Okay, have fun being married
for the rest of your lives.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.241
Annie, can...

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:40.948
Annie.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.852
Hey. Hey.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.060
What's going on?

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.932
I don't want to get
married in October.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:03.771
Okay.

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.374
When do you want
to get married?

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.145
Because we said,
"no more postponing."

01:19:11.147 --> 01:19:13.147
That was the deal.
I know.

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.916
Do you want to
get married to me?

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.186
I want to want to.

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:27.995
I have never wanted
to want anything
more in my whole life.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:34.435
You're my best
friend in the world,
but I don't wanna be a mom.

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:38.372
I don't wanna be a wife,
even your wife.

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:40.040
Well, then, maybe you're
just not ready, maybe...

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:42.877
Do you wanna get married
and you wanna have kids?

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.187
Yeah.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:55.122
I want you to
have those things.

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:17.878
Please have a seat.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.162
"Annie.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:38.999
"Your drinking has affected me
in the following ways."

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.080
I missed you.

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:29.950
I missed you.

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:41.562
<i> I was thinking</i>
<i> that, um...</i>

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:47.434
When we get home that
maybe we could
start talking about

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.038
potentially
moving in together,

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.042
if you feel like that's
something you wanna
start talking about.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:55.910
Uh, yeah.

01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:01.148
I could potentially
be into um, starting
that conversation.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.285
Cool.

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.968
Nice to meet you.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.436
Thank you so much.

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.639
Soon? We'll see you
in October though, right?

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.508
This was so fun.

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:29.476
Okay. Bye!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.446
Okay, bye, guys.
Everybody drive safe. Bye.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.647
Thank you.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:35.015
Yeah. Thank you.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.158
Uh, what about
New Orleans?

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.094
Could stay all night.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.465
Have you ever
been to L.A.?

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:53.534
No.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.064
Can I get you
anything to drink?

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:28.035
Yeah. Can I please
have an orange juice?

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.339
Actually, uh...

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.543
No, don't worry.
Orange juice is great.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:40.714
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.690
Can I get you
anything to drink?

01:23:50.305 --> 01:23:56.810
