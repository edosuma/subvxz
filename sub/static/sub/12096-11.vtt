11:52.960 --> 11:55.395
Well, there's something
I always say.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.799
In your life, you're entitled
to one really stupid thing.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.116
Right?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.277
I say five.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.637
Five stupid things.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.790
Oh. Well, I guess I say one
because I once did
a really, really stupid thing.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.673
What?
Oh, I can't tell you.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
Oh, come on, Ma.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.675
No. It was the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.155
[CHUCKLING]

12:19.360 --> 12:22.478
I can't tell you. No.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.673
No, I can't. I'll tell you
about the time I...

12:25.880 --> 12:27.758
[LAUGHING]

12:27.960 --> 12:29.838
I can't tell you that either.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.352
Um... Okay, I got it.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.916
I'll tell you about when I once, uh...

12:35.600 --> 12:36.795
I once...

12:37.000 --> 12:38.639
[LAUGHING]

12:41.240 --> 12:45.154
Oh, God, I can't tell you that.
That's the most awful.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.393
Okay, I got it.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.599
That's worse than all the others.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.156
So that's four stupid things.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
Is it?
Yeah.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.479
Four stupid things that are
so stupid you can't tell us.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.753
Well, I guess you're right.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.555
We're entitled to five stupid things.

13:07.760 --> 13:11.640
I told you, five. What do you think,
I made that up? That's a statistic.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.913
So I guess you've got four more.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.640
But please,

13:19.280 --> 13:21.078
no more like this one.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.634
Okay, I promise.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.435
I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.394
Okay.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.519
Go to sleep.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.199
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
Okay.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.359
Good night, Mr. Gerber.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.359
Good night.
Good night, Mrs. Campbell.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.799
Well, she's...
She's all right, that lady.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.315
Yep.

13:46.720 --> 13:51.431
Her husband, uh...
He's a little nervous,
but he means well.

13:51.640 --> 13:56.032
And your brother is a nice guy.
I just worry about him
tripping over his robe.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.355
But that wooden fellow...

14:00.080 --> 14:01.560
He's not related.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.195
Well, I didn't think he was.
I mean, he's wood.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.154
I don't know.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.319
I don't know what the world
is coming to anymore

14:10.520 --> 14:13.911
when a gay man, who was thinking
of becoming a woman

14:14.120 --> 14:16.271
then decides on suicide,

14:16.480 --> 14:20.076
turns out to be the most normal
member of the family.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.877
[♪♪♪]

14:26.040 --> 14:27.872
[♪♪♪]

14:35.720 --> 14:37.871
Oh, uh, hi, babe. What's up?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.197
I should ask you that.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.039
What are you talking about, Corinne?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.277
I'm talking about walking
into the pro shop

14:44.480 --> 14:47.040
and finding you
licking some woman's ear.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.038
What are you, crazy?
That was Mrs. Carr.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.277
I was, uh, giving her some pointers
for the tournament tomorrow.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.756
I had to whisper,
in case her opponent walked in.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.873
Oh, really? Is that a fact?
And two hours ago,

14:57.080 --> 14:59.834
when you said you had a lesson
on Court 3, where were you?

15:00.040 --> 15:02.236
I said Court 5.
You weren't on Court 5.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.750
Did I say 5? It wasn't 5. It was 8.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.158
Look, I saw the girl you gave
a lesson to in the locker room.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.114
An hour's lesson in this heat,
and she wasn't sweating.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.834
She was smiling.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.192
I know. It's incredible.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.280
The girl doesn't sweat.
Has never perspired in her life.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.520
She was telling me about it.
It's a medical problem.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.910
Very dangerous, actually,
because when she can't sweat,

15:24.120 --> 15:27.955
she can't rid her body of toxins and
can poison herself to death. Poor thing.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.629
Peter, I found hairpins in our bed.
I don't use hairpins.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.196
I do.
You use hairpins?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.551
Sure, when I run out of paper clips.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.513
I found a pink headband.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.154
Mine.
Pink.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.397
Used to be red. Faded.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.752
Look, Peter, I know what you were,
but if we're gonna live together,

15:46.960 --> 15:50.749
you're gonna have to stop
fooling around with other women,
or I'll leave.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.520
Honey, I'm not fooling around.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.792
I'm a teacher.
I gotta get to know my students.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.151
To teach them the inner game.
That's all it is.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.160
Okay. Okay. But I've given up
a lot for you, Peter.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.670
I've given up my home
and my family,

16:06.880 --> 16:08.951
someone who's very important
to me.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.639
So if you're lying to me
and I catch you,

16:13.840 --> 16:16.150
I swear, Peter, I'll kill you.

16:16.360 --> 16:20.195
Oh, Corinne, Corinne, Corinne.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.119
[MOUTHING]

16:25.880 --> 16:27.837
[♪♪♪]

16:36.080 --> 16:37.560
Hi, Jess.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.357
I hope you weren't worried
when I didn't come home last night.
I worked so late, I stayed in town.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.560
Chester, I, uh, saw you yesterday.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.116
Well, Jessica,
you see me every day.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.155
I saw you eating lunch
and kissing Claire.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.840
Eating lunch and kissing Claire?

16:58.040 --> 17:01.033
I remember the eating.
I had the roast beef.

17:01.240 --> 17:05.871
It was so tough, I had to send it back.
But I, uh, don't remember the kissing.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.999
Wait. Yes, of course.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.000
It was Claire's birthday
and she gave me a kiss
for taking her to lunch.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.400
That's what it was.
No, Chester.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.796
You were kissing her on the neck.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.789
I wasn't kissing her on the neck,
Jessica. I was smelling her neck.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.074
She wanted me to smell the perfume
she'd gotten as a present.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.280
Please, Chester.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.353
You had your face burrowed
so deep in her neck for so long,

17:26.560 --> 17:30.315
I was surprised
you weren't asphyxiated.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.958
That was to look
at the rash, Jessica.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.835
The perfume she wanted me to smell
gave her a rash that
she wanted me to look at.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.635
In fact, I sent her straight
to the dermatologist.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.718
You know, Chester,
in all these years,

17:44.920 --> 17:48.072
I've never believed the stories
that people told about you.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.159
But now I...
Stories. Oh, Jessica.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.636
Do you know why people
make up stories like that?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.559
It's because they're jealous.

17:55.760 --> 17:59.834
You see, they have so little
themselves that they can't
stand to see us happy. So...

18:00.040 --> 18:02.680
Oh, enough. Chester, please.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.032
Do you know how
that makes me feel, Chester?

18:06.240 --> 18:07.913
Do you know?

18:08.240 --> 18:11.836
To realise that my husband
has been carrying on with every...

18:12.040 --> 18:16.239
Oh, fine, Jessica.
Go ahead. Believe filth.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.877
How would you feel, Chester,
if you found out I had had an affair?

18:20.080 --> 18:21.275
You?

18:21.480 --> 18:22.880
[LAUGHING]

18:25.400 --> 18:26.993
What is so funny?

18:27.200 --> 18:30.591
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Jessica,
but I mean, I just don't think of you

18:30.800 --> 18:33.634
as someone who has an affair,
that's all.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.594
You and Julie Andrews.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.872
Well, Chester, I had one.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.117
Really? With whom?

18:42.320 --> 18:46.519
That is not important, Chester.
I mean, really, the name is
not important.

18:46.720 --> 18:51.431
Jessica, if you think that by telling me
about an affair you've never had

18:51.640 --> 18:54.474
you're going to get me to admit
to affairs I've never had,

18:54.680 --> 18:55.955
you're crazy.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.920
It's true, Chester.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.352
Oh, Jessica, you are funny.
Ha-ha-ha!

19:01.680 --> 19:03.319
I'm not funny, Chester.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.989
If there is one thing
I am not right now, it's funny.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.431
So will you please stop laughing?

19:10.920 --> 19:13.071
You were never here, Chester.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.751
And I mean, when you were here,
somehow, you weren't really here.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.917
Just like Fluffy.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.469
What?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.400
Well, you remember Fluffy,
the cat we had.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.354
I mean, you know, she would eat
and she would wash herself

19:28.560 --> 19:30.995
and then she'd just lay around,
you know?

19:31.200 --> 19:33.635
And I don't believe once,
in all those years,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.957
that she ever really looked
at any of us.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.753
I mean, of course,
it was hard to tell.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.475
With all that hair, you couldn't see
if her eyes were open.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.071
Which was, of course,
why we called her Fluffy.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.151
I mean, Chester,
that's why I had an affair.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.635
Because of Fluffy?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.517
Chester, it was short.

20:04.040 --> 20:08.239
It wasn't very spectacular.
And it is over now,

20:08.440 --> 20:10.671
but, you know, for a little while,

20:10.880 --> 20:13.076
minutes maybe,

20:13.280 --> 20:15.749
somebody was really there.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.279
You had an affair?

20:20.200 --> 20:23.272
You mean,
you slept with another man?

20:23.480 --> 20:27.474
Well, I mean, Chester,
that's usually what an affair is.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.073
How could you?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.989
How could you do that to me?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.960
How many people know
about this affair, Jessica?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.037
How many people have you
bragged to about it?

20:38.240 --> 20:39.799
I never bragged about it, Chester.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.880
I mean, that isn't something
I exactly felt like bragging about.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.514
I trusted you, Jessica.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.997
All these years, I trusted you.

20:49.840 --> 20:54.278
And you went out and had a cheap,
dirty, sordid little affair.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.796
Well, Chester,
I don't think of it that way.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.233
I mean I did think of it that way
for a while,

21:02.440 --> 21:03.874
but I don't anymore.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.720
I mean, I prefer to think of it as

21:07.240 --> 21:09.152
something that happened.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.079
Something that happened?

21:11.280 --> 21:14.398
Chester, what I did was wrong,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.638
and I am not trying to minimise it
by saying this,

21:17.840 --> 21:20.719
but I mean, Chester,
what I did for a few weeks,

21:20.920 --> 21:23.435
you made into a career.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.078
What are you talking about?

21:31.280 --> 21:34.273
Chester, surely you are not
going to go on denying...

21:34.480 --> 21:37.359
I am.
You have never been unfaithful?

21:37.560 --> 21:40.553
That's right. Never. I never have,
and I never would. Not once, not ever.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.674
Because I, Jessica, believe
in the sanctity of our marriage.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.194
Chester?
What?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.631
Blow it out your ears.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.160
Jessica.

21:54.360 --> 21:58.036
You know what's really funny,
Chester?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.596
I mean, this is the first time
in all these years

22:00.800 --> 22:04.157
we've ever talked about anything
that really matters.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.591
And you're not even
really talking, Chester.

22:06.800 --> 22:11.079
I mean, please, let's be honest
with each other, for God's sake.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.193
I mean, that's all we've got left to be.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.631
Well, I have been honest, Jessica.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.314
All right, Chester.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.555
Where you going?
I don't know.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.479
What do you mean, you don't know?
Just what I said.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.752
Jessica. You can't just leave.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.440
Just watch, Chester.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.880
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Now that Burt can,</i>

22:51.080 --> 22:53.595

<i>Will Corinne really kill Peter</i>
<i>if she catches him fooling around?</i>

22:57.240 --> 22:59.709
<i>Will Peter continue to fool around?</i>

22:59.920 --> 23:01.479
<i>Will Corinne catch him?</i>

23:01.680 --> 23:04.115
<i>Now that Danny's been</i>

<i>Will Jessica really walk out</i>
<i>on Chester?</i>

23:09.480 --> 23:10.630
