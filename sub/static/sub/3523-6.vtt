02:27.070 --> 02:30.221
I told the guy on 13th Street
to go see Gigi.

02:30.430 --> 02:32.944
- Did he call Beansie?
- Gigi, Beansie...

02:33.110 --> 02:36.147
Only us Italians use nicknames
to that extent.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.342
- No, your Chinese.
- No.

02:39.510 --> 02:43.867
- Yeah, the violinist Yo-Yo Ma.
- Soubriquet.

02:44.070 --> 02:47.187
It's another word for "nickname."

02:48.870 --> 02:50.781
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?

02:51.030 --> 02:53.146
Nothing. Tony?

02:55.070 --> 02:56.662
- How you doing?
- Good.

02:56.870 --> 03:00.146
I took Danny to the doctor,
like you said.

03:03.430 --> 03:06.149
- My son?
- Yeah, right. How's he doing?

03:06.390 --> 03:13.068
- You were right. It wasn't pneumonia.
- Great. I'm glad to hear it.

03:15.150 --> 03:18.354
I made you some bread.
You know, a thank-you.

03:18.919 --> 03:22.518
- You didn't have to do that.
- I wanted to. It's date nut.

03:22.727 --> 03:25.719
Listen... Tracee, right?

03:26.607 --> 03:30.839
Your bread's very sweet,
and you're a great girl.

03:31.087 --> 03:35.877
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you can't do stuff like this.

03:36.047 --> 03:39.084
- No good.
- But I just wanted to say thanks.

03:39.287 --> 03:43.360
I know, but I already got a family.
They give me gifts.

03:43.607 --> 03:47.964
- We have an employer-employee thing.
- Can't we be friends?

03:48.167 --> 03:52.922
I'm not sure that's such a good idea
either, because you and Ralphie...

03:53.167 --> 03:56.284
- Yeah, Ralphie.
- I'm glad your kid's okay.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.246
Let's go, Betty Crocker.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.446
Bread.

04:11.527 --> 04:13.165
Russell Crowe is trapped.

04:13.327 --> 04:17.684
They're gonna sever off his head.
And he's telling them how to do it?

04:17.887 --> 04:23.166
I know. And then he yanks the sword
from that dude. That was so phat.

04:23.367 --> 04:26.439
When the guy got hit,
chunks of his head flew.

04:26.647 --> 04:28.603
- Enough.
- We're talking.

04:28.807 --> 04:31.002
- People are eating.
- Thank you.

04:31.407 --> 04:36.720
Why do you let him watch this garbage?
Erin Brockovich, that was a nice one.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.846
- I didn't care for it.
- You did too. What are you talking?

04:41.647 --> 04:43.638
See who that is.

04:44.487 --> 04:46.921
Since when did I become a butler?

04:47.167 --> 04:49.965
It's Jackie Jr.
He locked himself out.

04:50.167 --> 04:53.398
- No accountability.
- People forget their keys.

04:54.087 --> 04:57.921
There he is!
Fresh Prince of New Jersey.

04:58.127 --> 05:00.482
How you doing?

05:01.407 --> 05:02.522
Don't get up.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.042
- I'll fix you a plate.
- Sit down.

05:05.247 --> 05:08.125
I can't.
Dino Zerilli's out in the car.

05:08.367 --> 05:12.155
- You sure? Go bring him in.
- Next time.

05:12.487 --> 05:15.763
- I'll leave them in the mailbox.
- We'll use my set.

05:15.967 --> 05:19.437
- I'll put them on the counter.
- Am I the Invisible Man?

05:20.047 --> 05:21.605
Your sister around?

05:22.007 --> 05:24.601
She's at school studying.
Any message?

05:24.807 --> 05:29.722
No, just hello. I'm gonna
hit the road. Sorry to interrupt.

05:29.927 --> 05:32.725
- Stay out of trouble.
- So handsome.

05:32.927 --> 05:36.681
- Good kid.
- A little pigheaded, if you ask me.

05:36.887 --> 05:41.483
Every advantage, this kid.
College, good home life.

05:41.687 --> 05:45.919
I had to quit school
in the 11 th grade. Help my mother.

05:46.167 --> 05:49.284
Supposed to be an architect.

05:53.927 --> 05:57.886
So when did you first notice me?

06:00.207 --> 06:04.325
I don't know.
History of Film, I guess.

06:04.567 --> 06:09.277
The way you talked, you know.
I turned around to see who you were.

06:09.487 --> 06:13.366
- And...?
- Nothing.

06:13.527 --> 06:17.281
- What? Say it!
- No. Leave me alone, please.

06:17.487 --> 06:20.684
- I won't stop till you say it.
- Okay, wait.

06:20.887 --> 06:23.685
I thought you were cute, all right?

06:23.887 --> 06:25.878
I knew it.

06:37.887 --> 06:39.479
Hello?

06:41.007 --> 06:45.876
I'm sorry.
I just don't know where else to go.

06:51.847 --> 06:55.317
- You guys hanging out?
- We were.

06:58.087 --> 07:02.922
- You okay?
- I went over to see that movie.

07:03.167 --> 07:07.877
- Old horror film. Freaks.
- Tod Browning, 1932.

07:08.087 --> 07:11.477
All these horrible people in it
with pointy heads.

07:11.727 --> 07:14.605
One guy had no legs.
He hopped on his hands.

07:14.807 --> 07:19.119
You can't keep exposing yourself
to things that upset you.

07:19.367 --> 07:25.078
I know. But why is other people's pain
a source of amusement?

07:27.847 --> 07:30.520
- What are you doing?
- It's just a habit.

07:30.767 --> 07:36.319
Stop it, all right? You're gonna
be bald. It's obsessive-compulsive.

07:36.687 --> 07:38.882
- I'm going.
- Don't go because of me.

07:39.087 --> 07:42.204
I have that poli-sci paper anyway.

07:53.447 --> 07:56.280
- Please don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

07:56.487 --> 07:59.684
It's just you're really moody,
you know?

08:01.487 --> 08:06.083
- I think I miss my ferrets.
- You gotta snap out of this, Caitlin.

08:06.327 --> 08:09.876
- You need to talk to someone.
- I'm taking BuSpar pills.

08:10.087 --> 08:12.647
Maybe that's not enough.

08:14.807 --> 08:17.685
- Where are you going?
- The library.

08:33.807 --> 08:35.957
See you later.

08:36.486 --> 08:41.515
I'm sure coming here has been
a culture shock for her.

08:41.687 --> 08:46.681
For us, L.A., New Jersey, we're used
to the mean streets, you know?

08:46.887 --> 08:50.926
For someone like Caitlin,
from Bartlesville, Oklahoma...

08:51.167 --> 08:55.285
...New York's probably
a little overwhelming.

08:55.487 --> 08:58.479
Maybe we should try
and be patient with her.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.879
What?

09:03.087 --> 09:04.884
Nothing.

09:05.287 --> 09:10.122
You're sweet.
Most guys wouldn't even give a shit.

09:10.367 --> 09:14.679
Well, I'm not most guys.

09:34.687 --> 09:37.076
Do you have a condom?

10:18.447 --> 10:20.483
Are you okay?

10:22.287 --> 10:23.879
Yeah.

10:46.887 --> 10:50.880
- A.J., call Lindsey Blundetto.
- Hi.

10:51.087 --> 10:56.559
- You're home? Don't you have class?
- It's Friday. Only in the mornings.

10:58.287 --> 11:02.917
- It's time for a dental cleaning.
- God, I just went.

11:03.167 --> 11:07.285
- Smells great! What is that?
- A cake for A.J.'s fundraiser.

11:07.487 --> 11:12.607
- Nice shoes. Daddy home?
- He's upstairs.

11:13.287 --> 11:15.517
- What's with you? You seem...
- What?

11:15.767 --> 11:17.883
Nothing, I don't know.

11:18.647 --> 11:22.196
- They're making a movie with Eloise.
- Should be cute.

11:22.407 --> 11:24.762
It's coming out around Christmas.

11:25.007 --> 11:29.637
Remember? I almost got in a fight
with the kid who called her Heloise.

11:29.847 --> 11:32.236
- The Spanish girl.
- She was annoying.

11:32.447 --> 11:35.280
I can't believe you remember.
You were 9.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.284
Hello.

11:38.487 --> 11:41.684
So when it opens, we are so there.
You and me.

11:41.887 --> 11:46.642
I know you're excited to see me,
but try to control yourself.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.724
How is school? What's new?

11:48.967 --> 11:51.879
Caitlin's a pain.
She cries over everything.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.725
She misses her family.

11:53.927 --> 11:57.124
Thank God for Noah.
Only he can calm her down.

11:57.367 --> 12:02.919
She started pulling her hair out. She
does it all the time. Her scalp's raw.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.318
- Oh, my God.
- A straitjacket will cure that.

12:06.527 --> 12:09.997
It's Mr. Sensitivity,
who doesn't have any problems.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.882
- I'm agreeing with you.
- Like you have a clue.

12:15.687 --> 12:17.678
Jesus, what the fuck?

12:17.887 --> 12:21.675
She's under a lot of strain,
and you did start this.

12:21.927 --> 12:26.478
Did you see? How I didn't rise
to the bait? The melanzane?

12:26.687 --> 12:29.963
Lot of good it did me,
does anybody!

12:30.287 --> 12:33.120
It's still going on!

12:55.967 --> 12:57.798
You're on the poles tonight.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.923
- Why the hell's Mandee in?
- VIP work, VIP prices.

13:02.167 --> 13:05.876
It's 50 bucks to me,
plus a blowjob later on.

13:06.087 --> 13:09.159
You'll make
at least half a G in there.

13:16.487 --> 13:20.719
Look at that! It's like an ad
for a fucking weight loss center.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.882
- Before and way before.
- This guy ever stop breaking balls?

13:26.247 --> 13:29.523
Hear what I said?
They're like a weight loss ad.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.883
Before and after.

13:32.087 --> 13:34.726
I wanna show you
where the horse bit me.

13:34.967 --> 13:37.083
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

13:39.927 --> 13:45.081
Look at this vision!
How you doing, sweetheart?

13:46.847 --> 13:48.678
Hey, Ralph.

13:48.887 --> 13:52.277
"I have come to reclaim Rome
for my people."

13:52.487 --> 13:54.603
How you doing?

13:55.087 --> 14:00.559
"I have come to reclaim Rome
for my people!"

14:00.767 --> 14:03.440
I don't get it. What do you mean?

14:03.647 --> 14:07.925
- Fucking Gladiator, you fuck!
- Oh, the movie. I didn't see it.

14:08.127 --> 14:10.516
You're an asshole, then.

14:11.687 --> 14:15.760
What do we have here?
What is this, the handsome contest?

14:16.007 --> 14:19.443
- Ralphie.
- You. Behave, you.

14:20.887 --> 14:25.324
- Baby, I was wondering where you were.
- Whoa, fucking kiss me?

14:25.567 --> 14:30.197
How many cocks you sucked tonight?
Go on, get me a drink.

14:31.647 --> 14:33.046
Skipper!

14:34.687 --> 14:36.484
Where's Tony?

14:37.967 --> 14:41.277
- Getting his weasel greased.
- Your kid brother's here?

14:41.487 --> 14:43.443
Ralphie, word to the wise.

14:43.647 --> 14:50.246
I'm just fucking around and breaking
balls. I got a cousin who's a fag.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.685
Fucko!

14:55.007 --> 14:58.886
This weekend, get the video.

14:59.087 --> 15:01.681
Gonna be a quiz next week.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.197
He'll be in a trunk someday.

15:05.407 --> 15:09.685
"We are all dead men,"
as Russell Crowe said.

15:10.407 --> 15:16.277
- Hey, come on.
- "All we can do is choose how we die."

15:17.047 --> 15:21.518
- That fucking hurts!
- No. All that fat?

15:21.727 --> 15:24.480
He's out of control, this pazzo.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.678
Hey, Ralph.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.801
Come on, man.

15:31.527 --> 15:34.087
All right, come on.
Put it down, Ralphie.

15:34.287 --> 15:38.678
"I am father to a murdered son...

15:38.887 --> 15:42.323
...husband to a murdered wife.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.996
I will have my vengeance!"

15:48.007 --> 15:50.282
Jesus Christ!

15:50.487 --> 15:52.523
Goddamn it, Ralphie!

15:52.727 --> 15:56.481
- Come on!
- What the fuck you doing?

15:56.687 --> 15:58.996
My fucking eye! I'm blind!

15:59.247 --> 16:01.317
What's the matter with you?

16:01.567 --> 16:03.683
It was an accident!

16:06.807 --> 16:10.117
- What did you do?
- Nothing. We were fucking around.

16:10.327 --> 16:13.285
- Stop being a baby!
- Take him to the hospital.

16:13.487 --> 16:15.523
- What?
- Just take him.

16:16.287 --> 16:19.279
Come on, pussy boy.

16:21.207 --> 16:23.198
Fucking stonato, this guy.

16:25.807 --> 16:28.924
- Did you like the bread?
- What?

16:29.087 --> 16:34.878
- The date nut bread. I have recipes...
- Sweetheart, not now, all right?

16:45.687 --> 16:48.485
I was up all night.
You could have called.

16:48.727 --> 16:52.959
I didn't realize I need
your permission to visit my house.

16:53.207 --> 16:54.560
Sorry.

16:54.727 --> 17:00.279
I kept having this image of you
in the hospital with your throat cut.

17:00.487 --> 17:05.356
I appreciate your concern, but you
should focus on your own problems.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.882
There was this thing on TV...

17:08.047 --> 17:12.518
...about how Charles Lindbergh's baby
was kidnapped and killed.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.234
Jesus Christ already!

17:15.607 --> 17:17.962
- Don't go.
- I'm going to Noah's.

17:18.166 --> 17:21.796
Yeah, well, at least
you have a boyfriend!

17:26.087 --> 17:29.682
- She's got me all wound up.
- Put her out of your mind.

17:29.887 --> 17:32.276
If I could do that.

17:32.847 --> 17:36.157
We should find her a guy.
Don't you have friends?

17:36.407 --> 17:40.480
Do you think I'd subject one
of my friends to Caitlin?

17:42.087 --> 17:43.884
I have an idea.

17:44.087 --> 17:48.080
Her birthday's coming up.
We'll take her out to celebrate.

17:48.287 --> 17:50.881
You mean like to Live Bait?

17:51.087 --> 17:56.878
- Get her drunk. It'll cheer her up.
- Please, she's bad enough sober.

17:57.207 --> 18:00.085
Bet I know what would cheer you up.

18:00.767 --> 18:02.485
Oh, yeah?

18:02.767 --> 18:04.280
What?

18:10.367 --> 18:12.358
Go to the fuse box.

18:12.527 --> 18:15.246
In the cellar, Janice.

18:15.407 --> 18:18.524
Call the gas company.
What do you want from me?

18:18.767 --> 18:21.600
You chose to live there, remember?

18:26.407 --> 18:28.477
Well? What do you think?

18:28.687 --> 18:33.602
- About what? What am I looking at?
- My teeth. I got braces.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.883
What do you want, a parade?

18:36.087 --> 18:39.523
- Don't fraternize.
- I was showing Tony my braces.

18:39.767 --> 18:44.079
I didn't shell out three crackers
for you to model your teeth.

18:44.287 --> 18:47.518
Get to work. Come on.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.877
Anything else?

18:56.367 --> 18:59.723
Ralphie's sticking her.
Why don't he pay for her teeth?

18:59.887 --> 19:04.085
It's a loan. I'm juicing her.
Usually it's fake tits they want.

19:04.287 --> 19:06.926
She don't need those.
That's for sure.

19:07.167 --> 19:13.436
Kid's a thoroughbred, but Madonna,
those chompers. Fucking train wreck.

19:22.807 --> 19:26.720
Happy birthday to us all.
That was a barrel of monkeys.

19:26.967 --> 19:28.719
Jeff kept staring at me.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.527
You wanna check out Smoke's?

19:31.767 --> 19:36.682
- I'm a little tired.
- Yeah, right. It's getting a bit late.

19:36.927 --> 19:41.717
Oh, my God. That is so sad.

19:45.447 --> 19:49.679
- Come on, Caitlin.
- No, we should give her some money.

19:50.287 --> 19:54.405
- Caitlin.
- Excuse me, miss? Miss!

19:54.687 --> 19:55.676
Miss?

19:58.167 --> 19:59.759
Oh, my God!

20:01.407 --> 20:03.921
Not bad, Chrissy. Decent week.

20:04.087 --> 20:09.320
Not bad? I'm running ragged here.
18-hour day? I should work at Denny's.

20:09.567 --> 20:12.604
Like they'd fucking hire him.

20:13.847 --> 20:19.479
Are you crying? Keep it up,
I'll give you something to cry about.

20:24.847 --> 20:26.200
Watch the braces.

20:28.887 --> 20:34.280
- God, it was so horrible.
- It's over, Caitlin. Okay?

20:34.487 --> 20:39.083
How can you be so callous?
That was the most horrific thing ever.

20:39.487 --> 20:43.799
It was a homeless woman
with the Daily News up her butt.

20:44.047 --> 20:49.758
Every time I close my eyes,
I just keep seeing her. Oh, my God.

20:49.967 --> 20:54.882
Let's go to the health center. They'll
give you something to calm down.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.080
No. No more drugs.

20:59.927 --> 21:03.283
Caitlin, don't start drinking,
come on.

21:06.687 --> 21:11.477
I have to get up early tomorrow.
Josh is on the redeye from L. A...

21:12.367 --> 21:16.485
My friend from Crossroads High School.
I didn't tell you?

21:16.687 --> 21:22.364
He's coming in and we're gonna head up
and see his brother at Hampshire.

21:25.687 --> 21:28.679
Try and get some rest, okay?

21:39.727 --> 21:43.515
Where do you think
she sleeps at night?

21:49.767 --> 21:51.564
Hi.

21:52.287 --> 21:58.362
- When did you come in?
- Just now. Sorry, were you sleeping?

22:04.967 --> 22:07.561
It's good we're paying for that dorm.

22:07.807 --> 22:12.562
It's Caitlin again, I can't sleep
there. Forget about studying.

22:12.767 --> 22:15.565
Like you were studying at 2 a.m.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.759
Noah and I took her out
for her birthday.

22:19.007 --> 22:23.558
And she starts having conniptions over
this homeless lady in the street.

22:27.807 --> 22:31.356
And how are things with Noah?

22:32.167 --> 22:34.965
He's going to Hampshire
with his friend.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.601
He said he told me, but he didn't.

22:37.847 --> 22:41.806
- Is it weird that he'd do that?
- I don't really know him.

22:42.047 --> 22:45.722
And his friend Josh?
I guess he's okay.

22:45.927 --> 22:49.966
- So you two are still dating, then?
- Is that a problem?

22:50.167 --> 22:52.761
You started this conversation.

22:55.567 --> 22:58.559
You never scheduled
a dental appointment.

22:58.767 --> 23:01.122
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll do it.

23:03.407 --> 23:06.558
And Jackie Jr. says hello.

23:09.927 --> 23:12.999
Noah's great, but he can be odd.

23:13.247 --> 23:18.958
One minute he's all affectionate,
and the next he's a different person.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.964
Meadow, are you in love with this boy?

23:26.367 --> 23:28.562
I don't know.

23:28.767 --> 23:30.917
I guess so.

23:31.967 --> 23:37.325
- I mean, at this point, I better be.
- At what point? What does that mean?

23:37.527 --> 23:41.600
Sorry, but we are so not having
that conversation.

24:02.487 --> 24:05.957
Tony? Do you have a second?

24:06.367 --> 24:11.157
You said we can't be friends,
but there's no one else I can talk to.

24:13.767 --> 24:18.318
- I'm pregnant. It's Ralphie's.
- Congratulations.

24:23.367 --> 24:26.245
He acts like he doesn't give a shit.

24:26.487 --> 24:29.445
- Ever think he's not acting?
- Should I keep it?

24:29.647 --> 24:31.399
I'm not getting involved.

24:31.647 --> 24:34.798
If I have it,
you think he'll help me with it?

24:35.047 --> 24:38.562
Oh, sure, it'll be Father Knows Best
over there.

24:42.087 --> 24:44.840
Look, you want my advice?

24:46.367 --> 24:50.997
You got a kid. Problems with that,
burning him with cigarettes...

24:51.167 --> 24:56.878
My social worker says it's anger from
my mom holding my hand on the stove.

24:57.087 --> 24:59.043
Whatever, okay?

24:59.287 --> 25:04.122
Your situation, you need another kid
like you need a hole in the head.

25:04.287 --> 25:06.881
You got your figure,
you're making money.

25:07.087 --> 25:09.555
So I should get an abortion?

25:09.807 --> 25:15.325
With Ralphie as the father,
you'd be doing this kid a favor.

25:20.847 --> 25:23.281
Urban Outfitters is having a sale.

25:23.527 --> 25:26.246
- We're out of syrup.
- You use a gallon.

25:26.447 --> 25:28.119
- Shut up.
- You wanna go?

25:28.327 --> 25:31.046
- Do you need shoes?
- Shoes, some new tops.

25:31.247 --> 25:33.203
- I need underwear.
- Wanna go?

25:33.407 --> 25:37.366
- Wait till the laundry's done.
- Let Lilliana do it.

25:37.567 --> 25:41.685
- She's off.
- It'll be a zoo when we get there.

26:01.167 --> 26:05.604
- Meadow here?
- She paged me, she's at her parents'.

26:06.767 --> 26:10.157
- Wanna hang out?
- I'm writing my paper.

26:10.367 --> 26:12.801
You mind if I just sit and study?

26:13.047 --> 26:17.962
I'm fine, really.
It's just creepy up there alone.

26:20.967 --> 26:22.764
All right.

26:40.566 --> 26:43.558
What, are we short? Who we missing?

26:43.806 --> 26:47.594
Tracee. Left sick on Saturday,
haven't seen her since.

26:47.846 --> 26:52.158
For three days? Fucking twat!

27:09.886 --> 27:13.561
My mom wants me to go
to Vermont this weekend.

27:14.126 --> 27:17.914
- For what?
- Dad's friends, Paul and Irion Dudley.

27:18.126 --> 27:21.004
Paul's a psychiatry professor
at Dartmouth.

27:21.246 --> 27:26.400
They have a horse farm, ride and talk.
Paul's very inspiring.

27:27.366 --> 27:29.641
Sounds good.

27:29.846 --> 27:33.998
I feel better already.
Irion is an amazing cook.

27:34.166 --> 27:38.239
If I just don't get freaked out
by the sound of the pine trees...

27:38.446 --> 27:40.880
I'm going to Noah's.

27:45.286 --> 27:49.359
This Moltisanti kid,
he's got his head up his ass.

27:50.126 --> 27:54.756
This is a great gladiator movie?
Look at Kirk Douglas' fucking hair.

27:55.166 --> 27:59.557
They didn't have flattops
in ancient Rome!

27:59.926 --> 28:04.363
- What do you wanna drink, baby?
- Get me a Fresca.

28:09.486 --> 28:12.125
C-fucking-minus!
And it's all her fault.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.803
- Six hours! She wouldn't let me work.
- I know.

28:16.006 --> 28:19.396
The questions, the whining,
the crazy nonsense.

28:19.646 --> 28:24.162
She doesn't get economics,
so I give her my notes from last year.

28:24.406 --> 28:29.355
I'm talking primo notes, I got an A.
She doesn't understand my writing.

28:29.566 --> 28:34.003
- "What does this mean? Blah-blah."
- Nothing's ever enough with her.

28:34.246 --> 28:38.762
I know I'm the R.A., but technically
she's not even on my floor.

28:39.366 --> 28:43.803
C minus. Really beautiful, Noah.

28:43.966 --> 28:46.764
It's not that bad, okay?

28:47.966 --> 28:50.764
I want options
when I graduate, Meadow.

28:51.006 --> 28:55.477
I'm going to law school in two years.
A C minus is fucked for me!

28:55.766 --> 28:59.361
It's early in the semester,
you'll make it up.

29:15.486 --> 29:19.161
- Is that all right, honey?
- Fine.

29:21.966 --> 29:24.196
You know I'd take care of you.

29:24.446 --> 29:29.076
You, Danny, our gorgeous little baby.

29:29.326 --> 29:32.398
- Who's that?
- The fuck should I know?

29:32.646 --> 29:35.763
Ralphie, open up!

29:36.446 --> 29:38.198
Shit.

29:40.686 --> 29:42.358
Ralphie!

29:50.126 --> 29:53.038
- Where's Tracee?
- She's busy.

29:53.246 --> 29:55.396
- Hey, Sil.
- Put your shoes on!

29:55.606 --> 29:57.198
What'd I say?

29:57.406 --> 30:02.275
I don't know. What'd you fucking say?
Three days she missed work!

30:02.486 --> 30:06.240
- I've been sick, Sil.
- Oh, yeah? I called your house.

30:06.446 --> 30:08.437
You haven't been there.

30:08.606 --> 30:13.157
- Ralph's taking care of me.
- You got a little kid at home!

30:13.366 --> 30:16.517
- Her mother's watching him!
- Mind your business!

30:16.726 --> 30:22.358
- Where you get the balls to come here?
- Three grand, this cuts into me!

30:25.966 --> 30:28.241
Go on, get out of here.

30:28.646 --> 30:30.762
Let's go!

30:35.886 --> 30:40.198
What's the matter with you?
You know the opportunity you've got?

30:40.446 --> 30:42.596
- Working for you?
- Keep it up.

30:42.846 --> 30:46.202
In two seconds,
I could get a job at any other...

30:46.446 --> 30:49.006
Listen to me, you little pucchiacca!

30:49.246 --> 30:54.161
Until you pay what you owe, your
shaved twat belongs to me! Understand?

30:54.406 --> 30:56.795
- I asked you a question!
- Yes.

30:57.046 --> 30:59.799
Yeah, now, get in the car!

31:08.566 --> 31:11.956
Then I go to pour the milk
and the carton is empty.

31:12.166 --> 31:15.203
- It's not me, it's A.J.
- Nice try, mister.

31:15.366 --> 31:17.721
How about the football trance?

31:17.886 --> 31:22.357
We're talking, but if that TV's on,
he's not hearing a word.

31:22.526 --> 31:24.198
One time, this happened!

31:24.406 --> 31:28.638
- Like talking to furniture.
- Men have the attention span of kids.

31:28.846 --> 31:31.758
I'm sorry, honey, what'd you say?

31:32.646 --> 31:35.160
This cake, Rosalie.

31:35.366 --> 31:37.675
- Really delicious.
- The whole meal.

31:37.886 --> 31:40.559
I'm glad we could reciprocate.

31:43.366 --> 31:45.197
College boy! How's school?

31:45.446 --> 31:49.598
Good. You know, cracking the books.
Almost dean's list.

31:49.846 --> 31:54.476
What's this "almost"?
Give me his name, no more almost.

31:55.166 --> 31:58.920
- I'm going out. I'll stay at Bobby's.
- Don't drink and drive.

31:59.126 --> 32:03.404
- He knows better than that. Right?
- Yeah, whatever you say.

32:03.646 --> 32:06.956
Get lost. Enjoy your youth.

32:08.326 --> 32:13.400
- You didn't tell me it was so fancy.
- Calm down, it's just my father.

32:13.646 --> 32:17.241
It'll be nothing compared
to meeting your dad.

32:19.766 --> 32:21.563
There he is.

32:23.046 --> 32:25.162
Hey, Dad.

32:25.366 --> 32:28.164
- Meadow, this is my father, Len.
- Hello.

32:28.406 --> 32:31.557
Len Tannenbaum. Please sit.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.645
How was the flight?

32:34.806 --> 32:38.958
Aside from Tim Daly chewing my ear
for an hour, it was great.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.158
- You know the guy from Wings?
- He did his deal.

32:42.366 --> 32:47.804
Usually I enjoy L.A. to New York.
It's the only time I get to do work.

32:48.006 --> 32:54.036
He flies first class. DVD player with
any movie. Never even opens the case.

32:54.206 --> 32:59.405
Bad enough representing them. I have
to suffer through their movies too?

32:59.566 --> 33:04.276
Is it exciting being an entertainment
lawyer, meeting the celebrities?

33:04.486 --> 33:07.683
- Beats working.
- He's in town to meet Dick Wolf.

33:07.886 --> 33:13.006
- The sportscaster?
- He's a TV producer. Law & Order.

33:13.206 --> 33:15.276
- New York Undercover.
- I loved that.

33:15.486 --> 33:20.719
- A cocktail before dinner?
- Guys, are we drinking wine?

33:22.206 --> 33:25.915
Clos Pegase, the '94 if you've got it.

33:29.366 --> 33:33.803
So, Meadow, what business
is your father in?

33:34.046 --> 33:37.243
Actually, he's in waste management.

33:37.566 --> 33:40.717
Toxic chemicals, medical waste,
that sort?

33:40.926 --> 33:44.157
Yeah, sort of. Environmental cleanup.

33:48.766 --> 33:55.160
Okay, let's give a big Bada Bing
welcome to Tracee.

34:14.966 --> 34:17.560
That guy cut the line.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.563
Go.

34:22.565 --> 34:24.362
What's the matter?

34:24.565 --> 34:29.639
I told Caitlin that if we went to
the movies, I'd call her. I feel bad.

34:29.846 --> 34:32.963
I stopped feeling bad
when I saw that grade.

34:33.166 --> 34:36.397
My father's filing
a restraining order on her?

34:36.646 --> 34:38.556
What?

34:40.166 --> 34:43.522
- You're kidding, right?
- You don't know my father.

34:43.726 --> 34:47.355
He totally freaked when he heard
about the C minus.

34:48.966 --> 34:52.402
Couldn't you try talking to her first?

34:52.646 --> 34:56.797
- At this point?
- She thinks we're her friends.

34:57.045 --> 35:00.277
You have to set limits.
She was ruining our lives.

35:00.526 --> 35:03.199
We couldn't do anything without her.

35:03.446 --> 35:06.597
We certainly couldn't take her
to see this.

35:19.366 --> 35:21.357
Mrs. Custer grabs the artist:

35:21.566 --> 35:26.560
"I wanted a painting commemorating
my husband's last thoughts.

35:26.766 --> 35:30.998
You give me cows with halos
and Indians making love?"

35:31.246 --> 35:37.321
"Mrs. Custer," he says, "those are
your husband's last thoughts:

35:37.846 --> 35:43.079
'Holy cow!
Look at all those fucking Indians! '"

35:48.366 --> 35:51.836
- What, not even a hello?
- Fuck you, asshole.

35:53.006 --> 35:57.204
Nice. That's how you talk
to a man in front of his friends?

35:57.406 --> 35:59.636
Yeah, right. What man?

35:59.846 --> 36:03.043
- Oh, a double!
- You tell him, sweetie.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.918
I like this girl.

36:06.726 --> 36:09.194
Women, women, women.

36:09.446 --> 36:13.041
Why was I born handsome
instead of rich?

36:23.766 --> 36:26.564
- Leave me alone.
- What's wrong with you?

36:26.766 --> 36:30.122
- Why are you like this?
- Three days you don't call.

36:30.326 --> 36:33.159
Baby, I'm busy, I gotta work.

36:33.366 --> 36:37.803
How else will I take care of you
when you're nine months pregnant?

36:39.366 --> 36:42.199
- You serious?
- Of course, I'm serious.

36:46.446 --> 36:49.358
We'll get a little house.

36:49.726 --> 36:53.878
In a cul-de-sac. I know that guy
who's a mortgage broker.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.157
Really?

36:56.926 --> 37:03.001
- Ralphie, I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

37:05.366 --> 37:09.200
If it's a boy,
we'll name him after me.

37:11.166 --> 37:14.681
If it's a girl,
we'll name her Tracee after you.

37:14.926 --> 37:20.000
This way she can grow up to be
a cocksucking slob like her mother.

37:20.886 --> 37:23.446
Are you out of your fucking mind?

37:25.046 --> 37:29.642
- Skinny motherfucking piece of shit!
- That's right, get it all out.

37:29.806 --> 37:33.082
Get it all out, you little whore!

37:44.726 --> 37:48.355
That make you feel good?
You feel like a man?

38:22.566 --> 38:25.160
Look at you now.

38:44.926 --> 38:49.363
- Give me a fucking drink.
- What happened to you?

38:50.366 --> 38:54.564
Tracee. She slipped.

38:54.766 --> 38:58.395
We were arguing, I don't know.
She fell.

39:07.086 --> 39:10.237
Holy fucking shit!

39:10.486 --> 39:13.956
Get a sheet, Chrissy. Cover that up.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.199
- Where is he?
- Inside.

39:19.446 --> 39:21.164
Go get him.

39:36.926 --> 39:38.996
- She fell?
- That's my story.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.238
You stupid motherfucker,
how fucking dare you?

39:42.486 --> 39:46.604
- Take it easy.
- You disrespect this place!

39:46.766 --> 39:52.204
- That's why you were passed over.
- It's my fault she's a klutz?

40:02.366 --> 40:07.724
- You out of your fucking mind?!
- This is the boss. Shut the fuck up!

40:07.926 --> 40:09.962
I'm a made guy!

40:11.046 --> 40:13.560
Ton, we gotta get you out of here.

40:13.766 --> 40:16.155
- This place open?
- Fuck!

40:16.366 --> 40:19.324
Get the fuck out of here, Ralph!

40:23.246 --> 40:25.919
Keep that door locked.
Get her out of here.

40:26.126 --> 40:28.560
You got a rug? A piece of carpet?

40:30.166 --> 40:32.760
Cocksucker was way out of line.

40:32.966 --> 40:35.958
Twenty years old, this girl.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.361
That too.

40:41.766 --> 40:43.961
Let's go.

41:11.366 --> 41:12.958
What?

41:14.526 --> 41:17.324
I think we need to talk.

41:18.926 --> 41:22.760
I think maybe we've been seeing
too much of each other.

41:22.966 --> 41:25.161
And...?

41:25.726 --> 41:29.162
I don't know. I mean...

41:31.686 --> 41:34.564
I really like you, Meadow.

41:35.566 --> 41:37.716
It's just...

41:39.286 --> 41:42.915
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

41:43.886 --> 41:47.561
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Are you that surprised?

41:49.326 --> 41:53.365
Why? I mean,
things were going so good.

41:53.566 --> 41:56.956
Honestly, you're too negative.

41:57.566 --> 42:00.000
You have this cynicism
about everything.

42:00.206 --> 42:05.326
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't want to get into this.

42:23.726 --> 42:26.843
So things are better, then?

42:27.086 --> 42:30.362
Since our first session?

42:36.286 --> 42:38.561
Yes, I guess.

42:38.966 --> 42:42.481
We seem to talk more easily.

42:47.126 --> 42:51.756
Sometimes, even painful sessions
can break the logjam.

42:51.966 --> 42:53.558
Yes.

42:56.686 --> 42:58.836
And then, this.

42:59.086 --> 43:04.114
- You're particularly quiet today.
- Sometimes I got nothing to say.

43:07.566 --> 43:11.002
Anthony, Carmela is here.

43:11.206 --> 43:16.155
She's giving up her time
to talk about your panic attacks.

43:19.646 --> 43:22.558
A young man who...

43:23.566 --> 43:26.034
...worked for us...

43:27.166 --> 43:31.603
...Barone Sanitation, he died.

43:32.166 --> 43:37.160
- Who?
- Who? You don't know him.

43:40.566 --> 43:43.160
He died, that's all.

43:45.766 --> 43:48.360
A work-related death.

43:53.166 --> 43:56.203
Sad when they go so young.

44:17.366 --> 44:19.960
How was the dentist?

44:32.686 --> 44:36.235
God, is there nothing to eat
in this house?

44:53.486 --> 44:55.556
Who knows? Maybe she quit.

44:55.806 --> 45:00.516
- She went outside and never came back.
- Keep that to yourself.

45:00.726 --> 45:04.605
Parties are Friday night.
Lot of high rollers, big tips.

45:04.846 --> 45:10.557
You want in the VIP Room? It's 50
bucks to me, plus a blowjob later on.
