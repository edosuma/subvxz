chorizo, black sausage,

13:12.814 --> 13:14.252

13:18.089 --> 13:19.257
Yes.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.968
After a week or two
here, even confirmed

13:21.969 --> 13:24.845
carnivores like myself
will fall to their knees

13:24.887 --> 13:27.348

13:28.099 --> 13:31.686
So is this normal, like,
lunch for people?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.521
Yes. Uh-hmm.

13:33.563 --> 13:38.859
Tell me, what did you do during
your time in Buenos Aires?

13:38.901 --> 13:39.881
Ate a lot of meat.

13:39.882 --> 13:40.861
Yes.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.774

in this country at all?

13:42.781 --> 13:45.533
You know, there are a lot
of vegetarian people here.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.972
Yeah right.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.369

big in Argentina?

13:57.378 --> 14:00.881
Because, I mean, the country
also has this gaucho tradition,

14:00.923 --> 14:02.342
a very macho tradition.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.051
Yes, but that's what
therapy is for.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.762
They can do it there.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.347
They can? So it's okay?

14:07.348 --> 14:08.889
Yeah, it is okay.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.933

14:13.102 --> 14:14.688

don't overshare.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.316
No.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.237

14:36.626 --> 14:38.795
I communicate for a
living, but I'm terrible

14:38.796 --> 14:41.130
at communicating with
people I care about.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.923
I'm good with my daughter.
