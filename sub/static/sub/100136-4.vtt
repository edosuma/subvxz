00:24.520 --> 00:25.720
How long were you waiting?

00:27.320 --> 00:28.320
Not long.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.440
Thank you.

01:08.760 --> 01:09.800
No one else stopped.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.840
Most people are dickheads.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
Yeah.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.960
<i>I wondered why Alyssa had wanted
to pick someone up.</i>

01:18.880 --> 01:20.680
<i>Maybe she was putting off going back.</i>

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
Are you okay?

01:23.720 --> 01:26.440
- What?
- Well, it's the middle of nowhere.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.120
You're on your own.
So you're either in danger,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.920
or you're mental.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.880
Alyssa.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
What?

01:33.440 --> 01:35.760
<i>Or maybe she just didn't want
to be alone with me.</i>

01:36.280 --> 01:37.400
Did you just get married?

01:38.440 --> 01:39.440
She did.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.160
Where do you need to go?

01:44.080 --> 01:45.200
Anywhere.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.840
Okay.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.720
I'm Alyssa. This is James.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.880
Hi.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
I'm Bonnie.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
Hi, Bonnie.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.520
<i>Alyssa found
quiet people difficult.</i>

02:06.880 --> 02:09.440
<i>I don't think
we automatically made sense to her.</i>

02:10.440 --> 02:11.480
Where are you from?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.360
- Bonnie.
- Hmm?

02:14.440 --> 02:16.040
Where are you from?

02:18.520 --> 02:20.520
<i>Maybe something happened to her.</i>

02:23.120 --> 02:24.320
What was that?

02:32.760 --> 02:33.960
Oh, no.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.760
What the fuck is wrong with your car,
James?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.880
It's literally the bane of our life.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.560
<i>It was nice she said "our life".</i>

02:40.240 --> 02:41.080
Shut up.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.680
Do you have a spare?

02:43.440 --> 02:44.600
That is the spare.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.680
I'm going for a piss.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.320
Sorry about this.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.320
I'm thirsty.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.320
Have you got any water...

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
in your car?

03:08.640 --> 03:09.960
Oh. Yeah.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.400
I thought it was here.
Maybe it's...

03:19.000 --> 03:20.160
Maybe it's in the back.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.560
Maybe I finished it.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.680
- Good news.
- What?

03:26.760 --> 03:28.960
There's a house or something up the road.
I saw smoke.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
How close?

03:30.480 --> 03:31.720
Really close.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.520
Do you want to sit in the car?

03:37.600 --> 03:38.520
Why?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.200
So your dress doesn't get ruined.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.520
I think we've gone beyond that point,
James.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.280
Well, this isn't creepy at all.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.520
What were you, the bridesmaid?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
How can I help you?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.296
- Can we use your phone?
- And please could I use your toilet?

04:51.320 --> 04:52.600
Yes.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.280
<i>Everything was refusing to go to plan.</i>

04:57.360 --> 05:00.680
<i>But then, we had no plan.
That was the problem.</i>

05:01.320 --> 05:02.320
Okay.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.520
They can't do anything until the morning.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.880
- Shit.
- Sorry.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.120
Do you have a number for a taxi?

05:12.600 --> 05:15.840
Well, there's only Steve,
and he's just had a baby, so...

05:16.640 --> 05:17.760
Right.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.920
Do you have any rooms?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.800
- What?
- Yes, we've got all of them.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.320
- We'll take two.
- No, we can't afford that.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.240
I'll pay. You picked me up. You saved me.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.000
<i>Saved her from what?</i>

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Okay.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.480
Thanks.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.640
You and James want to be
in the same room, don't you?

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
Yeah, that's fine.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.480
<i>It's better that way.</i>

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
<i>It's cheaper.</i>

05:47.960 --> 05:48.960
Room ten.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.240
Seven.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.000
This was the last room they had.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
Okay.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.440
Do you reckon those are real?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I don't know.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.480
They're quite sharp.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.920
All right, Captain Safety, chill out.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.080
We should check on Bonnie.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.080
We should leave her alone.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.640
Why?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.320
She's not right.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.360
Just because someone's quiet,
it doesn't mean they're not right.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.360
Are you talking about yourself?

06:55.560 --> 06:56.680
She paid for the room.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.200
Would you like to have a drink with us?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
Hello?

08:01.880 --> 08:02.880
Hello.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.040
What can I get you?

08:21.240 --> 08:23.240
<i>I can't believe
this is my wedding night.</i>

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
I don't think this is proper wine.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.040
Is that a burn?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
Yep.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Suits you.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Thank you.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.560
So where were you headed...

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
when you picked me up?

08:42.760 --> 08:44.000
I was taking her home.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.760
Why are you still in your wedding dress?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.680
Because I ran away from the wedding.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.040
Why?

08:50.120 --> 08:51.400
Because I did.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.640
Who were you getting married to?

08:53.720 --> 08:54.960
My boyfriend.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.400
Did he cry?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.640
Do you want to mind your own business?

09:06.320 --> 09:07.680
I was going to get married.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.680
But then my boyfriend died.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.800
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

09:13.760 --> 09:14.920
How did he die?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.120
Are you feeling like
a bit of a spare part?

09:19.400 --> 09:22.560
- What?
- Well, three's a crowd. Four's a riot.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.240
Well, I can sit down if you want.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.920
Why would she want that?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.920
I'm just being friendly. Calm down.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.880
How do you know I didn't marry her?

09:34.560 --> 09:36.480
- What?
- Maybe I was the vicar.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.320
Just stop bothering her.
She's not desperate.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.640
Thank you.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.280
Probably get stabbed in our beds now.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.200
<i>I probably deserve it.</i>

10:10.840 --> 10:12.160
You look so beautiful.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
Thanks.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.360
I thought you were more likely
to end up dead than married.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.800
Right.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.440
You can relax now.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.560
He's safety. He's solid.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.280
<i>Says the woman abandoned

10:27.360 --> 10:28.400

10:30.600 --> 10:31.600
I am.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.720
How do you feel?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.560
Exactly the same.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.320
You're a lucky girl.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.240
<i>I do.

Alyssa.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
Are you okay?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
I'm tired.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.200
I don't normally drink.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Okay.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.280
You're quite small up close.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Am I?

12:05.560 --> 12:06.760
Shall we get another one?

12:08.440 --> 12:10.440
Actually, I should check if she's okay.

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
Night.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
Sleep well.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.440
Who were you speaking to?

12:56.160 --> 12:57.360
No one.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
I need to take this dress off.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.360
What?

13:47.480 --> 13:48.840
She is a bit strange.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
Uh... yeah.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.080
Are you okay?

13:54.640 --> 13:55.680
Yes, James.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.080
This is exactly how I pictured
my honeymoon kicking off.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
You're thirsty.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.720
Have they abandoned you?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
I'm waiting.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
For what?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.520
For them to fall asleep.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
Fair play.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.320
Can I buy you another drink?

14:39.800 --> 14:42.200
I'm all right, really. Promise.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.120
I'll take you back tomorrow...

14:49.840 --> 14:51.160
if that's what you want.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.960
Maybe.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.040
<i>I didn't know what that meant.</i>

15:05.720 --> 15:07.000
What happened to you...

15:08.520 --> 15:09.720
after the beach?

15:13.320 --> 15:14.960
No one told me anything.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.960
Not properly, anyway.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.960
It was quite bad.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.360
Yeah, obviously.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.800
I couldn't walk for a bit.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.760
He was really supportive.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.600
Until he died.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Cheers!

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
What?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.520
I'm a bit Greek.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.040
Mmm.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.000
So what do you think of the place?

16:17.880 --> 16:19.720
The bars of soap are very small.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
Noted.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.640
- I'm single, by the way.
- I'm not.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.280
Are you happy?

16:32.840 --> 16:33.840
Yes.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
That's good.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.080
I get lonely.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.720
My wife ran off...

16:48.760 --> 16:50.360
- You off, are you?
- Yeah.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.040
Night.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.880
Night.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.320
I'm really sorry.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.240
I am.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.960
I tried to see you. I did.
But no one would let me.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.240
And then...

17:11.320 --> 17:14.560
<i>I was going to tell Alyssa
about the time her mum came to see me.</i>

17:14.640 --> 17:17.320
<i>But then she said something
that made me forget everything else.</i>

17:19.040 --> 17:21.000
I think I wanna kiss you.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
What?

17:23.440 --> 17:24.440
Is that bad?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.280
No.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.680
I don't think I can have sex.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.640
I didn't say sex. I said a kiss.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.520
I...

17:41.400 --> 17:44.240
I don't think it works anymore.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.760
I haven't tried,

19:25.640 --> 19:26.640
Um...

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
That's better isn't it?

19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
Yeah.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
These are nice.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.280
Can you leave, please?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.640
You don't have to touch it.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.160
You can just watch.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.000
You can turn round if you want.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.560
Get out!

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
Wait.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.240
Get... out.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.680
I... I'm sorry.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.360
I'm really sorry.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.120
Please don't hurt me.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
Please.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
I've got kids.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.200
Please put the gun down.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.480
Please put the gun down.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Put it down.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.440
What was that?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.360
I don't know.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.360
It's okay.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
What's wrong?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
Look, can you just give me a minute?

21:40.320 --> 21:42.360
I'm sorry. This is, like, a lot.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.240
Oh, yeah.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.680
Sure. I'll, uh...

21:50.200 --> 21:51.200
I'll be in there.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.440
Okay.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.800
Do you mind sleeping in there?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
No.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
That's fine.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.800
Thanks.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.480
It's going to be okay, Alyssa.
