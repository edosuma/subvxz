Joanie, we're going
to Parent-Teacher Day

01:29.323 --> 01:30.551
and talk to your teachers.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.320
Fine, but you don't have
to believe everything they say.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.361
You're not trying to hide
something from us,

01:35.462 --> 01:36.827
are you, sweetheart?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.456
No. I'm doing the same fantastic
work I've always done.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.797
I don't care what
my geometry teacher says.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.838
Well, we'll try
and keep that in mind.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.031
Bye-bye, Richard.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.164
Good luck, son.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.970
Oh, thanks, Dad.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.511
I'll be the one
who needs the luck.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.711
(chuckles)
Oh, that Lori Beth's cute.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.878
Not cute when she ties
my shoes together like this.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.115
- Hey, Richie.
- Oh, hi, Fonz.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.589
How ya doing?

02:07.227 --> 02:09.217
Listen...

02:09.329 --> 02:11.559
I just, I'm returning your
parents' albums right here.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.860
They lent them to me, all right?

02:12.966 --> 02:13.990
- Yeah. Fonz...
- You tell 'em.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.068
...you gonna come down

02:15.168 --> 02:16.568
and see the kid tear 'em up
tonight?

02:16.670 --> 02:18.536
Oh! Intramural action
at its finest.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.663
<i>Hm!</i>

02:19.773 --> 02:20.831
No.

02:20.941 --> 02:21.965
Oh.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.839
I'm going down
to the ballet studio.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.070
Oh, to pick up Colleen?

02:25.178 --> 02:27.044
Okay, I got an idea, Lori Beth's
down there, too.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.172
Pick 'em both up,
bring them all to the game.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.614
Oh, it's gonna be
a terrific one, Fonz--

02:30.717 --> 02:31.616
playing for first place.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.618
No.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.849
See, Richard,
Colleen and I got other plans.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.356
Oh.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.085
-(car horn honks)
- I better get going.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.593
You know, I'll tell you
something.

02:41.695 --> 02:45.359
I can't tell you how classy this
chick is, my little ballerina--

02:45.465 --> 02:47.365
she has made
a new man out of me.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.491
Yeah, that's great, Fonz.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.831
Potsie and Ralph
are out there, and I have...

02:49.936 --> 02:51.427
- You know something?
Look at this. -Huh?

02:51.538 --> 02:55.566
She's got me listening
to classical music, huh?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.975
- Mantovani...
- Mantovani?

02:59.079 --> 03:00.513
Yeah, Mantovani is nice.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.138
Yeah, Al's out there, too. I...

03:02.249 --> 03:05.912
Do you know that she is unlike
any other chick I know?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.750
That when I snap my fingers,
she don't just come to me.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.654
This butterfly, she glides.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.385
Uh, Fonz, I-l really got to go.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.291
I mean, we're providing
the game ball and...

03:15.395 --> 03:16.522
You know what happened
last night?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.564
This is really gonna
put a snap in your trunks.

03:18.665 --> 03:19.655
All right,
all right, tell me.

03:21.768 --> 03:25.261
She ate her soup
without making any noise.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.307
Oh, my gosh!

03:29.409 --> 03:30.775
I told you.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.005
Oh, I'm gonna have to tell
the guys about that! See ya!

03:33.113 --> 03:34.103
Oh, all right.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.448
Turn. That's not it.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.351
No, no, no, try it this way.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.093
Colleen, you're so good.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.687
Why are you wasting
your time here?

03:51.798 --> 03:53.994
Why don't you go to New York
and become a professional?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.069
Oh, I just couldn't find
a suitcase big enough

03:56.169 --> 03:57.728
to pack all my mirrors.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.501
I know, you don't want
to talk about it.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.372
Listen, I better call it a day.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.775
I'm late for Richie's
basketball game.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.713
Want to come along
or are you waiting for Fonzie?

04:09.816 --> 04:11.512
Yeah.

04:11.618 --> 04:14.053
You're really stuck on him, huh?

04:14.154 --> 04:15.314
He's so thoughtful.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.914
Last night,
all I did was mention

04:18.024 --> 04:19.959
that I liked fresh flowers,

04:20.060 --> 04:24.019
and he stopped the bike and
dug up two wild azalea bushes.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.225
Sounds like true love to me.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.699
Listen, I better get going.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.328
Last time I was late for
Richie's basketball game,

04:31.438 --> 04:33.304
he fined me two dollars.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.534
Chassé, pas de bourrée,

04:35.642 --> 04:36.632
and pirou...

04:36.743 --> 04:38.711
I'll work on it.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.178
Good luck with Fonzie.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.581
<i>COLLEEN: I had a wonderful time
last night.</i>

04:48.688 --> 04:50.520
<i>I</i> planted the azaleas.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.653
My little ballerina,

04:56.763 --> 04:59.232
I taste a little sadness
on your lips there.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.198
What's-what's going on
in your brain?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.928
Oh, nothing.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.835
Hey, I'm not just a gardener;
you can tell me.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.069
Well, I'm thinking
of closing down the studio.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.702
Why?

05:12.813 --> 05:17.182
Well, you know, five students
aren't exactly profitable.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.878
Maybe I'll go
to New York and study.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.352
New York?
Hey... (chuckles)

05:21.454 --> 05:22.717
you don't have to do that.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.949
You don't got no problem.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.786
You wanted azaleas?
I got you azaleas.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.952
You want students?
I'll get you students.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.554
But Fonzie...
it's not the same as azaleas.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.689
Correct-a-mundo.

05:32.799 --> 05:34.790
Students are easier;
they got no roots.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.532
HOWARD:
Come on, Marion.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.629
We're gonna
to be late for the movie.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.639
Coming, dear.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.573
Is Richard home yet?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.737
Not yet. I guess the game must
have gone into overtime.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.247
You know, I think maybe you
ought to take up basketball.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.942
I got a feeling
that's the only way

05:51.051 --> 05:52.348
you're gonna get to college.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.547
Oh... you know, I don't
understand why you're still mad

05:55.655 --> 05:57.681
about the Parent-Teacher
meeting.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.849
My grades are good.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.587
There are other things
besides grades.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.130
For example,
classroom behavior, huh?

06:04.231 --> 06:06.927
Oh, my behavior isn't that bad.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.401
Is that why the teacher calls
you, "Yak-Yak Face"?

06:12.672 --> 06:13.765
Mr. Stewart's a kidder.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.536
Actually, Yak-Yak Face
is a term of endearment.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.633
Mm...

06:19.045 --> 06:21.446
Yeah, well...

06:24.117 --> 06:26.518
...the kid came through
in the clutch again.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.986
All right, all right, three
seconds left in the game.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.784
Cunningham puts on
the old double fake,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.121
drives in for a hook shot--
swish!

06:33.226 --> 06:35.058
Boom, baby!

06:36.696 --> 06:39.825
Exactly what does
"boom baby" mean, dear?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.595
It means we won the game.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.068
What's going on here?

06:44.170 --> 06:47.140
Oh, right, the, uh,
Parent-Teacher Day.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.935
- Mm.
- How'd it go?

06:49.042 --> 06:50.840
Ask Yak-Yak Face.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.280
You got Mr. Stewart, huh?

06:54.381 --> 06:55.780
Yeah.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.475
See? He's crazy.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.576
Now, if you were in his class,
he'd call you... (laughs)

07:00.687 --> 07:02.485
- Ah...
- Never mind, dear.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.490
Now, we'll be right back as soon
as the movie is over.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.151
And there are sandwiches
in the refrigerator.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.785
JOANIE:
Yeah, Mom.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.558
Hey thanks, Mr. C.
Just the person I want to see.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.757
Close your eyes, visualize,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.198
how'd you like
to take ballet lessons?

07:15.302 --> 07:17.827
Ballet? Oh, I love ballet!

07:17.937 --> 07:21.567
Dancing and jumping,
and being lifted by hunks.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.165
Can I, Dad?

07:23.276 --> 07:27.145
Well, I guess it's all right,
if it doesn't cost me too much.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.578
But you behave yourself.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.276
I don't want to hear the teacher
calling you Yak-Yak Toes.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.442
Thanks, Dad.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.247
Yak-Yak Toes, that's funny,
Yak Yak...

07:34.354 --> 07:35.321
All right, look.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.787
Here, you fill this out Joanie,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.949
-and then you bring this
to class, all right? -Yeah.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.822
You're not gonna regret this,
Mr. C. It's great.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.123
Yeah. Well come on, we're
already late for the movie.

07:43.229 --> 07:46.631
All right, look, Richie...
how about you?

07:50.737 --> 07:51.932
FONZIE:
Okay, <i>I</i> got 'em here.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.130
Now you teach...

07:53.239 --> 07:55.208
you learn.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.639
- Right, Fonz.
- Right.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.336
- All right, class, we can begin.
- Great.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.174
Sorry, I changed my mind.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.308
But no way am I gonna do,
uh, all this stuff.

08:04.417 --> 08:08.047
You dance or you're gonna have
to learn how to walk...

08:08.154 --> 08:10.180
on your hands.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.191
Please, Fonzie,
let's not force anyone.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.557
All right, all right, you're
the boss, you're the boss.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.993
- Play the music.
- All right.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.257
Hey.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.593
Aprés vous--
that's French, you know?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.599
That's good. That's good.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.465
- Everyone over to the barre.
- Come on.

08:23.570 --> 08:27.597
Now, first I'd like to know why
you're all interested in ballet.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.175
I love the ballet.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.141
I ache for the ballet.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.542
Sometimes I even get
ballet aches.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.669
(laughs)

08:40.086 --> 08:43.385
All right, let's start
with grand plié.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.889
I already had dessert.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.051
Lori Beth, you demonstrate.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.219
Chachi, music.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.321
Okay, you start
in first position...

08:52.432 --> 08:53.422
(classical piano music playing)

08:53.533 --> 08:55.695
...and then you sort of squat.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.930
And you keep your back up
straight

08:58.037 --> 08:59.938
and your knees to the side.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.133
My girl. Good.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.267
Now everybody try.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.040
- Oh, this is gonna be
a piece of cake. -Yeah.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.136
(fabric ripping)

09:12.819 --> 09:14.878
Do you have something
I could wear?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.457
All we have are tutus.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.458
A one-one will do.
(laughs)

09:20.560 --> 09:22.892
I've still got it,
even in embarrassment.

09:24.764 --> 09:25.788
All right, everybody turn.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.924
One, two, three,
two, two, three,

09:28.034 --> 09:29.297
three, three, three.

10:07.740 --> 10:12.144
Now, class, I'd like to show you
what you can ultimately achieve.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.735
But I need somebody very strong

10:13.847 --> 10:15.644
and agile to help me
demonstrate.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.649
Don't look at me.
I can't even move.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.776
I'm too tired to even watch.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.787
Hey, Cunningham, I think
she's calling your number.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.914
Oh, no, no, Fonz, I think
she's talking about you.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.219
I don't think so.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.793
No, please, aren't you talking
about Fonzie?

10:27.894 --> 10:32.525
Yes. Come on, Mr. Fonzarelli,
you can be my partner.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.622
(all agreeing)

10:33.733 --> 10:35.292
I don't dance.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.893
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Fonz.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.369
Hey, hey! Whoa! No!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.940
POTSIE: Come on.
You can do anything.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.599
RICHIE:
Give it a shot.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.767
All right, I need room.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.675
- Yeah.
- All right!

10:46.779 --> 10:48.270
Now remember what I said.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.679
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna try.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.012
Chachi, music.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.984
All right.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.748

11:25.318 --> 11:27.218

(all talking excitedly)

14:08.281 --> 14:09.840
All right,
that's enough for one day.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.815
- Yeah. -All right.
- Thanks for all coming.

14:11.918 --> 14:12.976
See you next week.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.212
- Okay. -Okay.
- Any homework?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.344
Oh, come on, Pots, please.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.718
Don't worry, Teach, I'll have

14:16.823 --> 14:19.292
the tutu cleaned and starched.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.985
I'm gonna grab a few
of those applications,

14:21.094 --> 14:22.891
and get me some partners.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.554
Wah, wah, wah.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.961
It must be the Fonzarelli blood.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.328
Hey, listen, you guys, uh,

14:27.433 --> 14:29.367
the dance stays in this room.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.460
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, Fonz, yeah.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.038
Thanks for the students, Fonz.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.074
Hey, wait a minute.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.074
You wanted a class,

14:37.176 --> 14:38.507
that was your first class.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.308
Hold on.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.348
All right, second class,
let's go.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.678
Come on, get in here.

14:44.784 --> 14:45.944
Hurry up, scoot it up!

14:49.288 --> 14:50.278
What are you gonna do?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.413
You gonna
wait there all day?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.788
Get in here.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.884
NQW!

14:59.632 --> 15:01.623
Hey, did you guys ever do this?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.333
Al, this has been
a pretty big week for you.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.410
I mean, first you're reffing
basketball games,

15:11.511 --> 15:13.035
then you're taking
a... a ballet class.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.512
I guess you must be
a little stiff, huh?

15:15.615 --> 15:16.673
Nah.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.841
Oh, that's terrific.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.748
Would you pass me
the salt, please?

15:25.391 --> 15:27.587
Al, get the salt, please?

15:27.693 --> 15:29.491
I'm passing it, Rich.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.463
Oh, well... here.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.590
- I guess I'm a little stiff.
- Yeah.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.794
(crashing in distance)

15:36.903 --> 15:39.235
Oh, no, trouble in the kitchen.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.330
I got to hurry up and get there.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.607
How you doing, Al?

15:47.713 --> 15:49.705
Not now, Fonz, I'm in a hurry.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.413
Yeah, it looks it, Al.

15:53.519 --> 15:54.611
It really looks it.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.881
- Hi, Fonz.
- Hey, listen.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.615
I got to ask you a favor,
Cunningham, all right?

15:57.723 --> 15:58.816
- Sure. -It's a little
chilly out and I want

15:58.925 --> 16:00.222
to take Colleen for a ride.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.452
Can I borrow your car?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.188
Oh sure.
Well, I-l have to drop off

16:03.296 --> 16:04.490
some homework at Lori Beth's.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.826
But I'll be right back.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.126
Well, unless, of course, uh,

16:07.233 --> 16:09.565
Lori Beth attacks me.
(laughs)

16:09.669 --> 16:11.330
Yeah, well, look, uh,
if she does,

16:11.437 --> 16:12.768
don't surrender this time,
all right?

16:12.872 --> 16:14.806
I want to make
my little butterfly happy.

16:14.907 --> 16:15.806
Yeah, okay, Fonz.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.035
All right, thanks.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.303
Oh, Fonz, uh, wait a minute.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.605
- There's...
- Yeah, what do you want?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.146
Something I've been meaning
to mention to you.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.010
You know, I don't even know
if this is any of my business.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.014
Yeah, shoot, shoot.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.085
Well, do you believe that,

16:26.185 --> 16:28.813
that Colleen is-is really happy?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.719
Why do you ask me that?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.120
Of course she's happy.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.216
I mean, uh, look at this,
I got new applications,

16:34.327 --> 16:37.262
her-her classes are thriving,
she's got me, you know.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.092
(laughs)
She's very f...

16:39.198 --> 16:40.529
why do you ask such a thing?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.897
Well, it's just because, uh...

16:43.002 --> 16:46.097
Well, you know she takes
that ballet class in Chicago.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.640
And-and her teacher there
says that he thinks

16:48.741 --> 16:50.505
she might be the best dancer
he's ever seen.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.407
Hey, I know she's
a great dancer.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.979
I ain't bad myself, huh?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.104
Well, yeah, that's true.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.205
But, see, he-he believes
that she might have

16:57.316 --> 16:58.511
the potential to become

16:58.618 --> 17:00.677
a-a great performer.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.812
Hey look, Cunningham,
this is Milwaukee, you know?

17:02.922 --> 17:04.390
You don't get
the cream of the crop here

17:04.490 --> 17:06.788
like the June Taylor Dancers,
you know?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.520
You just leave culture
to me, all right?

17:08.627 --> 17:10.425
Leave the culture to...

17:10.529 --> 17:13.657
Fonzie, she's been training
since she was a little tot!

17:13.766 --> 17:16.428
You don't practice ballet
to teach it.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.595
You practice it to do it, bucko!

17:18.704 --> 17:20.400
Bucko?

17:20.506 --> 17:21.701
Hey, let me tell you something.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.069
When it comes to knowing chicks,

17:23.175 --> 17:24.837
one of us has got
a slight edge, huh?

17:24.944 --> 17:26.502
Okay, Mr. Slight Edge,
how come you don't know

17:26.612 --> 17:28.012
that she wants to perform?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.809
There's a lot I know,
and the first thing I know

17:29.916 --> 17:31.907
is not to take advice from you.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.123
A lot of people
take advice from me!

17:37.223 --> 17:40.352
You don't see Joanie
wearing pigtails, do you?

17:43.996 --> 17:45.987
Why did I say that?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.777
<i>II</i>

18:38.217 --> 18:40.208

19:09.815 --> 19:12.216

20:04.336 --> 20:06.328
(music ends)

20:27.393 --> 20:29.156
Bravo.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.196
Fonzie!

20:31.297 --> 20:33.231
I'm sorry I'm not ready yet.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.493
Believe me...

20:34.600 --> 20:36.227
you're ready.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.427
Okay?

20:37.536 --> 20:41.063
Dancing looks
so beautiful on you.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.699
Why don't you go
to New York and perform?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.937
New York?!

20:46.045 --> 20:48.104
You love to dance, don't you?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.772
More than anything.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.316
Well, then, go to New York.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.475
Give it a shot.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.950
New York!

20:54.053 --> 20:55.213
Oh, I don't know, Fonzie.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.481
What if I'm not good enough?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.182
Hey, not good enough.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.690
Who are you talking to?

20:59.792 --> 21:01.191
You want something that bad,

21:01.293 --> 21:03.262
then you got to go
and take a shot at it.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.092
Not wonder what could've been.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.995
Well, what about my classes?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.464
I'm doing so good now.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.537
Colleen.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.366
You don't study ballet

21:13.472 --> 21:15.099
for that many years to teach it.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.404
You study ballet to perform it.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.910
Bucko.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.577
Cancel the "bucko."

21:26.418 --> 21:28.512
I guess I'm just afraid.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.918
Afraid?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.683
Heyyy.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.122
I've always wanted to.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.663
I really don't have
anything to keep me here

21:38.764 --> 21:41.324
except two azalea bushes.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.425
Let me tell you something,
Colleen, I don't want to sit

21:43.536 --> 21:46.232
across from you sometime
at a table, looking at a chick

21:46.338 --> 21:48.034
who's having second thoughts

21:48.140 --> 21:50.700
about what might have been.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.641
Maybe you're right, Fonzie,
but I...

21:52.745 --> 21:53.644
No, no, no.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.736
No buts.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.645
You just go.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.808
I love the ballet.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.943
- I live for the ballet.
- Oh, wait a minute.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.420
You're not gonna tell me one
of Ralph's jokes now, are you?

22:03.522 --> 22:05.718
No, I really love it.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.725
And I have some girlfriends

22:07.826 --> 22:09.727
in New York I could stay with.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.023
See there?

22:11.130 --> 22:13.189
Then everything is
just perfect, huh?

22:13.299 --> 22:15.358
You go get ready,
we'll celebrate.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.561
I'm so excited!

22:17.670 --> 22:19.570
And maybe even
I can study with him--

22:19.672 --> 22:22.471
Turgenev, the best of them all.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.068
Yeah, we'll celebrate.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.006
Whoa.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.211
Hey, Mr. Best of 'Em All...

22:38.224 --> 22:39.657
...just do me a favor, huh?

22:39.758 --> 22:41.727
Take real good care
of my chick, huh?

22:41.827 --> 22:43.818
Heyyy.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.429
(door opens)

22:55.708 --> 22:57.073
Okay, Fonz.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.145
Here's the keys,
car's downstairs.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.373
Culture. Huh.

23:02.481 --> 23:03.744
Bye.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.840
FONZIE:
Colleen's going to New York.

23:12.591 --> 23:15.219
She is?

23:15.327 --> 23:17.023
Yeah, you know, you were, uh...

23:17.129 --> 23:19.393
(stammers)

23:20.833 --> 23:22.767
As usual, you're very...

23:22.868 --> 23:24.768
(stammers)

23:24.870 --> 23:27.669
Anyway, she was very excited
about the idea of performing,

23:27.773 --> 23:29.468
she always wanted to,
uh, she was scared,

23:29.575 --> 23:31.168
I talked her
into giving it a shot.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.938
Fonz...

23:33.045 --> 23:34.843
that's a great thing
you just did.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.005
I did?

23:37.449 --> 23:40.317
What about if I sit
across from an empty chair,

23:40.419 --> 23:42.820
and I wonder
what could have been?

23:42.921 --> 23:45.413
Look, uh...

23:45.524 --> 23:47.424
want me to hang around?
ls there anything I can do?

23:47.526 --> 23:49.392
No, thanks a lot.

23:49.495 --> 23:50.621
Okay.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.720
I'll see you.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.501
Hey, Fonz?

23:57.603 --> 23:58.433
Yeah?

23:58.537 --> 24:00.699
Just hang in there.

24:00.806 --> 24:01.932
Whoa.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.032
(quietly);
Heyyy_

24:05.978 --> 24:07.969
I'm ready, Fonzie.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.548
Well, look who is here.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.981
If it ain't
a New York star dancer.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.186
Now those are enthusiastic lips.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.055
All right,
let's get out of here.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.026
No, let's have one last dance.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.054
All right, all right,
one last dance.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.156
I don't... you know...

24:33.072 --> 24:35.541
Not my kind.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.733
