[inhales deeply, exhales]

02:22.037 --> 02:23.373
[knocking at door]

02:25.706 --> 02:27.776
- [knocking continues]
- Just a second!

02:40.823 --> 02:42.891
Okay, I'm just
trying to help you.

02:48.796 --> 02:50.599
[inaudible]

03:18.026 --> 03:20.227
- [man on phone] <i>Where are you?</i>
- Almost home.

03:20.229 --> 03:22.696
<i>I told you
I had a dinner meeting.</i>

03:22.698 --> 03:24.231
I know.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.166
<i>I'm turning onto
the street now, okay?</i>

03:26.168 --> 03:27.233
<i>Do you see me?</i>

03:27.235 --> 03:28.670
[man]
Jesus, slow down!

03:40.616 --> 03:42.181
You can always just leave
him in the apartment.

03:42.183 --> 03:43.949
He's a big boy,
you know?

03:43.951 --> 03:45.785
Leave him
in the apartment?

03:45.787 --> 03:47.924
Is that how you want to
spend your week together?

03:48.556 --> 03:49.788
Come on, baby.

03:49.790 --> 03:50.859
Hold on a second.

03:56.831 --> 03:57.933
This is for you.

04:09.211 --> 04:11.110
- Go upstairs, baby.
- Can I see...

04:11.112 --> 04:12.481
Upstairs, Thomas.

04:13.782 --> 04:15.218
- Gee.
- See you later, pal.

04:19.288 --> 04:20.822
[sighs]

04:23.625 --> 04:24.659
[door closes]

04:26.228 --> 04:28.294
Full custody?

04:28.296 --> 04:32.100
It's with visitation. I'm not
trying to take him out of your life.

04:33.068 --> 04:34.537
You know this was coming.

04:36.305 --> 04:37.803
You have no grounds.

04:37.805 --> 04:40.041
I want what's best for my son.

04:40.942 --> 04:42.841
Our son.
Don't we both want that?

04:42.843 --> 04:45.344
We do alternate weeks.
We agreed.

04:45.346 --> 04:47.247
Yeah, we've been through
all this.

04:47.249 --> 04:49.315
In high school,
he's going to need a solid base.

04:49.317 --> 04:51.117
[sighs]

04:51.119 --> 04:55.087
Half the kids in that school
have divorced parents.

04:55.089 --> 04:56.755
Half the kids
in the fucking world.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.091
Yep. Yeah,

04:58.093 --> 04:59.729
but you haven't been
doing so great.

05:01.930 --> 05:02.965
Wow.

05:09.637 --> 05:11.239
He feels
your darkness, Lizzie.

05:11.906 --> 05:12.942
[scoffs]

05:15.310 --> 05:16.679
My darkness?

05:17.245 --> 05:19.115
[sighs] Come on. Look,

05:20.348 --> 05:23.082
I know you want him in as
stable a situation as possible.

05:23.084 --> 05:24.286
[sighs]

05:27.822 --> 05:28.890
[sniffles]

05:33.261 --> 05:34.697
[sighs]

05:35.863 --> 05:36.998
[door opens]

05:47.776 --> 05:49.845
I have to work
half a day tomorrow.

05:51.146 --> 05:52.213
Again?

05:54.149 --> 05:59.084
Yeah. So Grandma
will take you to Sam's party.

05:59.086 --> 06:00.755
And I'll come later.

06:04.925 --> 06:06.262
[sighs]

06:10.798 --> 06:11.933
Do you want to do this?

06:12.434 --> 06:14.203
- Can I?
- Yeah.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.973
Now just take
the price tag off.

06:36.358 --> 06:39.629
I'm gonna get us
some dinner ready, okay?

06:41.762 --> 06:42.798
Yeah.

06:44.399 --> 06:46.636
- [music playing]
- [children cheering]

06:55.142 --> 06:58.380
Hey, Mom, can I have
a party like this someday?

06:59.281 --> 07:03.082
Uh, sure. Why not?

07:03.084 --> 07:05.654
- Really?
- Maybe even in a house like this.

07:11.059 --> 07:15.461
[girl] Ten, nine, eight,

07:15.463 --> 07:19.899
seven, six, five, four,

07:19.901 --> 07:23.739
three, two, one.

07:25.973 --> 07:28.310
Ready or not,
here I come!

07:47.862 --> 07:49.495
- Boo!
- [gasps]

07:49.497 --> 07:53.065
- Oh, no!
- Oh, don't panic. It's all right.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.368
Can't sit back
and watch an innocent skirt die.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.906
- Oh.
- Here you go.

07:59.074 --> 08:00.141
I'm Claire.

08:00.841 --> 08:02.976
I'm Lizzie. Thanks.

08:02.978 --> 08:04.045
No worries.

08:28.302 --> 08:29.872
Who was that little girl?

08:32.339 --> 08:33.375
[Thomas] Which one?

08:36.544 --> 08:37.913
Really pretty.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.416
Big brown eyes.

08:43.217 --> 08:46.122
Long hair.
She was in a pink dress.

08:46.954 --> 08:48.990
I think that's Jeremy's sister.

08:52.494 --> 08:53.896
Do you know her name?

08:54.528 --> 08:56.028
[Thomas] Who?

08:56.030 --> 08:58.131
Jeremy's little sister.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.168
No.

09:00.368 --> 09:03.239
No, why would you?

09:05.506 --> 09:06.775
Come on.

09:11.413 --> 09:15.817
Let's have an early one, love.
Teeth, toilet, bed.

09:17.219 --> 09:19.254
[breathes shakily]

09:24.525 --> 09:28.897
[girl] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

09:29.597 --> 09:32.033
<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>

09:39.941 --> 09:42.344
[sniffles]

09:55.624 --> 09:57.026
[exhales sharply]

09:58.393 --> 10:00.428
[chattering]

10:03.431 --> 10:05.466
[laughing]

10:11.339 --> 10:13.973
It's so good.
I'm so excited.

10:13.975 --> 10:16.177
I haven't seen her for ages.

10:23.183 --> 10:25.086
- Bye!
- Bye, Lola!

10:26.654 --> 10:27.956
[woman] Lola!

10:30.457 --> 10:32.327
- Hi!
- [Lola] Hi!

10:36.530 --> 10:38.333
- Come on!
- [Jeremy] Yeah, coming.

10:42.671 --> 10:44.403
[car engine starts]

10:44.405 --> 10:45.607
[gasps]

11:31.586 --> 11:33.286
[woman] What do you want
for afternoon tea?

11:33.288 --> 11:35.021
- Muffins?
- [woman] Oh, yeah?

11:35.023 --> 11:37.190
- [Lola] Yeah.
- [woman] Muffins, huh?

11:37.192 --> 11:38.232
- [car honks]
- [Lola] Yes.

11:40.528 --> 11:42.728
[man] When you're on the right
wing, which is

11:42.730 --> 11:45.297
- sometimes where you play, I know...
- [woman chuckles]

11:45.299 --> 11:47.666
- ...you've gotta cross the ball...
- Hey, guys.

11:47.668 --> 11:49.035
- Oh, hello.
- [man] Hi.

11:49.037 --> 11:50.770
Good. You started without me.

11:50.772 --> 11:54.272
When the roast comes out of the
oven, we eat.

11:54.274 --> 11:55.340
We're starving.

11:55.342 --> 11:57.310
Hey, trouble.

11:57.312 --> 12:00.479
You taking it easy
on Mom and Dad?

12:00.481 --> 12:03.549
- Yeah.
- [man] We'll talk tactics later, okay?

12:03.551 --> 12:04.751
- [Thomas] Cool.
- [Lizzie sighs]

12:04.753 --> 12:06.051
There you go.

12:06.053 --> 12:07.119
Oh, thanks.

12:07.121 --> 12:08.286
Mm-hmm.

12:08.288 --> 12:09.756
Hey, listen, um,

12:09.758 --> 12:11.491
can you
have Thomas tomorrow night?

12:11.493 --> 12:13.028
Of course, <i>gumman.</i>

12:14.361 --> 12:15.762
And what have you got on?

12:15.764 --> 12:17.597
Oh.

12:17.599 --> 12:21.235
I know it's kind of last minute,
but, um, I have a date.

12:22.437 --> 12:26.108
- Oh. Like to stay tomorrow, Tommy?
- Yeah, sure.

12:28.076 --> 12:30.609
Tell me, who is he?
How did you meet?

12:30.611 --> 12:33.579
Alice set it up.
It's just... It's just a date.

12:33.581 --> 12:35.680
Mm. Really?

12:35.682 --> 12:37.552
Everything starts with a date.

12:38.552 --> 12:39.721
Good for you, Lizzie.

13:10.552 --> 13:11.620
[doors lock]

14:17.217 --> 14:19.253
[Lola humming]

14:42.476 --> 14:43.876
- [Lola gasps]
- [Lizzie gasps]

14:43.878 --> 14:45.114
[gasps]

14:47.414 --> 14:48.549
[Lola] Mum!

14:51.249 --> 14:52.249
Mummy!

14:59.927 --> 15:01.330
Mommy!

15:03.530 --> 15:04.565
Mom!

15:06.801 --> 15:08.336
I've got you!

15:09.470 --> 15:10.835
Hold onto me!

15:10.837 --> 15:12.240
Go away!

15:12.807 --> 15:14.773
I'm just trying to help!

15:14.775 --> 15:15.807
No!

15:15.809 --> 15:16.943
[echoing]

15:16.945 --> 15:19.214
[gasping, breathing heavily]

16:01.788 --> 16:03.824
[birds chirping]

16:28.349 --> 16:29.850
Do you want to
light the candles?

16:43.630 --> 16:45.299
We need to remember her.

16:49.836 --> 16:50.871
[sighs]

16:52.340 --> 16:54.309
[sighing]

17:18.398 --> 17:19.433
Hi.

17:26.874 --> 17:28.908
Claire. It's Claire, right?

17:28.910 --> 17:31.876
Yeah.
Sorry, I forget your name.

17:31.878 --> 17:34.646
Um, oh, Lizzie.
From Sam's birthday party.

17:34.648 --> 17:35.780
You saved my skirt.

17:35.782 --> 17:38.683
- Oh, yes. Hi.
- Hi.

17:38.685 --> 17:42.921
I saw this place listed online,
and I thought I'd check it out.

17:42.923 --> 17:46.394
- What a coincidence it's you.
- I know. [chuckles]

17:47.060 --> 17:48.661
So you guys are leaving?

17:48.663 --> 17:50.962
[Claire] Yeah, I'm afraid so.

17:50.964 --> 17:52.931
We're moving
all the way over to Perth.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.935
It's all happening really fast.

17:56.104 --> 17:57.471
Are you in the market?

17:58.806 --> 18:01.039
Well, I mean,
if the right thing comes around.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.976
- Just love this neighborhood.
- Yeah, it's great.

18:03.978 --> 18:06.782
Thomas. I got the new <i>Act Of War.</i>
Wanna play?

18:08.115 --> 18:10.749
- Oh, Mom, please?
- Oh, Thomas, I'm sure they are...

18:10.751 --> 18:12.884
It's totally fine.
He can stay and play.

18:12.886 --> 18:15.688
- Oh, no, I don't wanna impose.
- Oh, it's okay.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.526
It's like the planet's
arranging a play date.

18:18.159 --> 18:19.792
- Please, Mom?
- Can he?

18:19.794 --> 18:24.697
I mean, if it's no problem. I...

18:24.699 --> 18:28.066
Sure, why not? Um... But I won't stay,
though. I've got some errands to do.

18:28.068 --> 18:30.635
You go do them.
I'll keep my eye on these two.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.872
Okay, so what if I'm back in,
let's say, an hour?

18:32.874 --> 18:34.707
- Yeah, great. We'll be here.
- Okay.

18:34.709 --> 18:35.911
Let me take that, baby.

18:37.077 --> 18:38.811
- Have fun.
- I will. See ya, Mom.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.915
- Bye.
- Bye!

18:40.781 --> 18:42.783
[cutlery clattering]

18:56.029 --> 18:58.066
[sirens wailing]

19:03.837 --> 19:05.539
[gasping]

19:36.069 --> 19:38.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:38.172 --> 19:39.904
I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

19:39.906 --> 19:42.810
Not at all.
Thomas, your mum's here!

19:46.513 --> 19:48.750
Hmm. Oh, wow.

19:49.549 --> 19:50.915
Look at those ceilings.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.750
I would totally invite you in,

19:52.752 --> 19:54.719
but I have to take Lola
to dance practice.

19:54.721 --> 19:56.521
Oh, I didn't mean to impose...

19:56.523 --> 19:58.524
If I wasn't in such a
rush, I would.

19:58.526 --> 20:00.726
I was just thinking
maybe I should

20:00.728 --> 20:02.661
bring my husband around,
to come and look at the place.

20:02.663 --> 20:04.162
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Thomas] Hey.

20:04.164 --> 20:05.965
Or should I
go through an agency, or...

20:05.967 --> 20:08.601
Uh, no, no,
we can just go direct

20:08.603 --> 20:09.802
if you're really interested.

20:09.804 --> 20:11.170
Yeah, that would be great.

20:11.172 --> 20:13.271
Okay, uh, why don't you

20:13.273 --> 20:16.875
put your number in my phone,
and I can text you some times

20:16.877 --> 20:18.142
- for later this week?
- Sure.

20:18.144 --> 20:19.745
- And bring Thomas.
- [beeping]

20:19.747 --> 20:21.881
He and Jeremy
had a terrific time.

20:21.883 --> 20:24.249
Don't forget your swimsuit.
You can test out the pool.

20:24.251 --> 20:25.750
- Cool. Thank you.
- Yeah?

20:25.752 --> 20:27.920
- Thank you. See you.
- Bye.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.191
- See you.
- Cool, see you.

20:34.261 --> 20:36.764
So you're half Swedish,
half English?

20:37.198 --> 20:38.930
Yeah.

20:38.932 --> 20:41.033
My mom is Swedish.
My dad is English.

20:41.035 --> 20:43.067
I grew up in Stockholm.

20:43.069 --> 20:46.604
[chuckles] So how long
have you been single?

20:46.606 --> 20:50.744
Oh, I don't
think of myself that way.

20:52.246 --> 20:53.748
I thought you were...

20:54.781 --> 20:56.183
Oh, I am divorced.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.221
It's just, you know...

21:00.954 --> 21:04.759
I'm kind of still...
in the middle of it.

21:05.326 --> 21:07.058
I didn't mean to...

21:07.060 --> 21:08.760
[sighs]
No, no, it's fine.

21:08.762 --> 21:10.764
I mean,
it's been a while. I...

21:12.266 --> 21:14.769
I should, you know...

21:16.002 --> 21:17.038
move on.

21:19.073 --> 21:20.175
Mm-hmm.

21:24.311 --> 21:26.312
Did Alice tell you
I have children?

21:26.314 --> 21:27.779
Uh, she mentioned a son.

21:27.781 --> 21:29.014
Yeah, Thomas.

21:29.016 --> 21:30.181
I'd like to meet him.

21:30.183 --> 21:31.819
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uh...

21:32.353 --> 21:33.721
Uh, you have another?

21:34.922 --> 21:36.258
No, just Thomas.

21:37.325 --> 21:38.927
I thought
you said "children."

21:39.660 --> 21:41.059
[chuckles]

21:41.061 --> 21:43.898
Thomas is a lot to handle,
believe me.

21:54.075 --> 21:55.176
It's...

22:01.015 --> 22:06.688
As I said,
it's been a while since I...

22:11.325 --> 22:12.826
socialized.

22:22.369 --> 22:24.605
[breathing heavily]

23:02.977 --> 23:05.013
[moaning]

23:19.894 --> 23:21.895
Lizzie, let me look at you.

23:23.864 --> 23:24.966
Let me look at you.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.938
Look at me.
Let me look at you.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.709
- Argh.
- [Lizzie] Stop! Stop.

23:45.352 --> 23:47.922
[continues moaning]

24:20.788 --> 24:22.824
[breathes heavily]

24:36.503 --> 24:37.738
Okay?

24:47.981 --> 24:50.018
[exhales, sniffles]

24:59.160 --> 25:01.229
- I'm sorry.
- Lizzie, don't... What?

25:03.463 --> 25:06.300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Did I do something wrong?

25:24.285 --> 25:25.452
[knocking at door]

25:29.856 --> 25:30.988
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.224
Sorry,
we're a bit early.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.357
Oh, that's okay.
Come on in.

25:33.359 --> 25:34.526
- Hi.
- Hi, Thomas.

25:34.528 --> 25:35.930
Jeremy's in the pool already.

25:36.596 --> 25:38.330
Where's your husband?

25:38.332 --> 25:41.466
Oh, he couldn't make it.
Last minute thing.

25:41.468 --> 25:43.468
That's too bad.

25:43.470 --> 25:45.938
I guess we're the ones
that make the decisions anyway.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.873
- Yeah.
- I'll show you the main part of the house,

25:48.875 --> 25:52.143
but that's our au pair's room,
and bathroom here.

25:52.145 --> 25:54.982
- [children laughing]
- This is our piano room.

25:56.016 --> 25:57.051
Oh, wow.

25:58.051 --> 26:00.352
You've got great taste.

26:00.354 --> 26:03.158
We travel,
so I'm always picking things up.

26:06.926 --> 26:08.495
Living, dining.

26:09.896 --> 26:13.201
- The open plan was really important to us.
- Mmm.

26:14.934 --> 26:17.635
- [Lola] Is this better?
- [Claire] We put in the pool for the kids.

26:17.637 --> 26:20.007
It's a luxury, but we're hooked.

26:21.508 --> 26:23.107
Would you like to see upstairs?

26:23.109 --> 26:24.144
Yeah.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.282
So what do you do?

26:30.284 --> 26:32.450
I'm with Arlin Naturals.

26:32.452 --> 26:35.319
The one in Town Center.
I'm the manager.

26:35.321 --> 26:36.356
Oh, nice.

26:42.563 --> 26:44.199
This is the master.

26:46.532 --> 26:48.035
Oh, it's beautiful.

26:48.602 --> 26:50.102
Do you like it? Your job?

26:50.104 --> 26:51.471
Yeah. I do.

26:52.405 --> 26:54.538
Spare room.
It's great for guests.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.575
Mind you, sometimes I end up
in here if Bernie's snoring.

26:57.577 --> 26:58.879
[both chuckle]

27:00.681 --> 27:03.317
And this is Jeremy's room.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.249
It's a bloody mess.

27:07.221 --> 27:09.257
- It'd be great for Thomas.
- Yeah.

27:20.534 --> 27:21.870
[chuckles]

27:22.970 --> 27:24.404
Oh, I love this one.

27:26.205 --> 27:28.206
We were at my parents' house.
Jeremy was four.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.941
[chuckles]

27:29.943 --> 27:33.981
God, I was huge,
and I was only six months pregnant there.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.384
Do you have other kids?

27:38.117 --> 27:39.921
No, just Thomas.

27:49.128 --> 27:51.031
And this is Lola's room.

27:52.132 --> 27:54.602
There's plenty of space
for extra cupboards.

27:56.737 --> 27:58.236
[Lizzie] How old is she?

27:58.238 --> 28:00.238
She's seven.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.074
- And already a full wardrobe.
- [children chattering]

28:03.076 --> 28:04.945
Girls will be girls, right?

28:06.346 --> 28:08.046
Is she okay with the move?

28:08.048 --> 28:11.549
Oh, yeah.
It's all she talks about.

28:11.551 --> 28:16.488
You know, Bernie told her there's a unicorn
petting zoo in Perth, so... [chuckles]

28:16.490 --> 28:19.458
...now we've got a double trauma
coming up in the next couple of years

28:19.460 --> 28:23.030
between Santa Claus
and now the unicorns.

28:24.498 --> 28:27.265
- [Bernard] Where are my monsters?
- Oh, speak of the devil.

28:27.267 --> 28:30.171
- It's the unicorn whisperer. Come and meet him.
- [Lola] Hi, Daddy!

28:33.374 --> 28:37.209
I know it sounds really silly,
but I really hope you buy the place.

28:37.211 --> 28:40.077
- It would be in good hands.
- [Lola giggling]

28:40.079 --> 28:42.480
My God, this place
has been so good to us.

28:42.482 --> 28:44.382
Maybe it'll be good for you too.

28:44.384 --> 28:45.449
Yeah.

28:45.451 --> 28:46.718
- [Bernard] Hello.
- Hi.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.553
Lola, say hi to Lizzie.

28:48.555 --> 28:50.521
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:50.523 --> 28:54.258
I watched you swim.
You're really good.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.329
Thanks.

28:56.163 --> 28:58.529
- Buy it, Mum!
- [all laugh]

28:58.531 --> 29:00.766
Well, that settles it, then.
Meet the new owner.

29:00.768 --> 29:04.068
Well, we'll see, we'll see.
Um, can I use the loo?

29:04.070 --> 29:06.106
- Yeah, down the hall on your left.
- Thanks.

29:08.541 --> 29:10.374
What's your name, buster?

29:10.376 --> 29:12.076
Uh, Thomas.

29:12.078 --> 29:13.644
[Claire]
Now can I get you a drink?

29:13.646 --> 29:15.249
[Thomas]
Yes, please. Just water.

29:17.116 --> 29:20.687
[Claire] How was the pool?
Not too cold for you out there, is it?

29:26.192 --> 29:28.261
[breathing deeply]

30:10.537 --> 30:12.837
- [Claire] How many have you had today?
- [Jeremy] None!

30:12.839 --> 30:15.207
- [all laughing]
- [Bernard] Put them back. We're on a budget, boys.

30:15.209 --> 30:18.477
Don't touch, okay?
Just chew on some celery.

30:18.479 --> 30:20.280
[Jeremy] Oh, come on, please!

30:35.561 --> 30:36.596
Hey.

30:39.165 --> 30:40.400
Can I come in?

30:41.367 --> 30:42.502
Okay.

30:55.315 --> 30:56.350
Wow.

30:57.651 --> 30:59.287
You have such a nice room.

31:01.288 --> 31:02.690
Aren't you gonna miss it?

31:04.825 --> 31:06.727
- A little.
- Hmm.

31:10.730 --> 31:13.468
Hey, I know.

31:38.959 --> 31:40.394
Oh, look.

31:42.528 --> 31:43.564
What?

31:47.534 --> 31:49.403
Don't you think
we look alike?

31:56.442 --> 32:00.644
She seems great.
How long you two been friends?

32:00.646 --> 32:03.384
No, I barely know her.
The kids play soccer together.

32:04.718 --> 32:06.586
We could invite her
to stay for dinner.

32:07.788 --> 32:10.490
Yeah. We could.

32:11.692 --> 32:14.793
I was kinda hoping we might
get the kids to bed early

32:14.795 --> 32:15.960
and have a date night.

32:15.962 --> 32:17.831
Thomas!
Time to go home!

32:19.365 --> 32:20.765
You have
the perfect layout.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.400
- [Jeremy] Ask your mum.
- Thank you.

32:22.402 --> 32:24.869
Can I go ice-skating
on Wednesday with Jeremy?

32:24.871 --> 32:27.338
- Oh, Jeremy's obsessed.
- Please?

32:27.340 --> 32:29.841
Baby, I think it's a family day.

32:29.843 --> 32:32.380
- No, no, it's fine.
- No, he can come. Of course.

32:34.314 --> 32:36.484
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

32:38.719 --> 32:43.455
Okay, sure. Why not? Um, sounds like fun.
Go and get your stuff.

32:43.457 --> 32:44.922
[boys giggling]

32:44.924 --> 32:46.193
[Jeremy] Awesome.

32:47.827 --> 32:51.363
Thanks for showing me the house.
I'm seriously thinking about it.

32:51.365 --> 32:53.701
Well, we'd seriously
like you to buy it.

32:57.471 --> 32:59.804
[Lena] Tell us about your date.

32:59.806 --> 33:01.640
There's nothing to say.

33:01.642 --> 33:03.874
Well, are you
going to see him again?

33:03.876 --> 33:06.413
He was okay,
but nothing special.

33:07.513 --> 33:09.748
Trust me. For a woman
who married your father,

33:09.750 --> 33:10.882
you don't need special.

33:10.884 --> 33:12.449
[chuckles]

33:12.451 --> 33:13.517
Very amusing.

33:13.519 --> 33:14.555
[chuckles]

33:15.989 --> 33:19.724
It's just important
to have relationships in life.

33:19.726 --> 33:20.991
I know.

33:20.993 --> 33:23.594
You're either at that job

33:23.596 --> 33:25.462
or stuck in the apartment.

33:25.464 --> 33:27.465
It's not enough.

33:27.467 --> 33:30.367
We're gonna buy my friend's
house, so we won't be stuck.

33:30.369 --> 33:32.903
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

33:32.905 --> 33:37.374
Yeah, I was just looking around,
seeing what's out there.

33:37.376 --> 33:41.746
- Sure.
- It's big. Really big. And there's a pool.

33:41.748 --> 33:43.918
We used to do that.
Window shop.

33:46.752 --> 33:49.624
Yeah, I know I can't afford
it, but it's fun to look.

33:52.025 --> 33:53.928
You... You said
we might buy it.

33:54.994 --> 33:56.728
Yeah, maybe one day, baby.

33:56.730 --> 33:57.932
You're such a liar!

33:59.098 --> 34:02.499
Thomas. That's enough.

34:02.501 --> 34:05.272
I hate the apartment.
I can hear you clean your teeth.

34:05.939 --> 34:07.738
And I can hear you pee.
So what?

34:07.740 --> 34:09.476
And I can hear you cry
all the time.

34:14.413 --> 34:17.614
- I wanna live with Dad.
- [Lizzie] Thomas.

34:17.616 --> 34:19.918
You're always saying you'll get
things done which you never do.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.518
Oh, that's not true.
You know that's not true.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.088
Yes, it is.
And you're always sad.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.489
I'm not sad.
I'm not fucking sad.

34:26.492 --> 34:29.860
- Lizzie.
- I'm getting it done, okay? I'm getting it done.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.563
You never get anything done!

34:31.565 --> 34:32.896
- [Lena] Now now.
- [Carl] Come back here!

34:32.898 --> 34:34.099
- Dad!
- Control him!

34:34.101 --> 34:35.967
- [door slams]
- It's okay, baby!

34:35.969 --> 34:38.009
It's not okay.
And you shouldn't be swearing at him.

34:41.407 --> 34:42.442
[scoffs]

34:45.143 --> 34:47.414
- [sniffling]
- [door opens]

34:53.619 --> 34:54.822
[sighs]

34:57.757 --> 34:59.826
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the house.

35:00.827 --> 35:04.465
I got excited,
and it was a dumb idea.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.869
I thought
we were gonna live there.

35:12.606 --> 35:13.741
I'm sorry, baby.

35:15.541 --> 35:16.677
I...

35:19.146 --> 35:21.782
I know I'm not always
the best mom.

35:24.951 --> 35:29.657
But, um...
there's just a lot going on now.

35:30.157 --> 35:31.759
And I'm doing my best.

35:33.893 --> 35:35.495
I'm doing my best, baby.

35:39.699 --> 35:40.768
I love you.

35:47.507 --> 35:49.510
I love you so much,
baby.

35:52.813 --> 35:54.849
When you hurt,
I hurt too.

36:02.588 --> 36:04.023
I wanna live with Dad.

36:05.826 --> 36:09.429
Well, you do.
Half the time.

36:11.197 --> 36:13.063
Not like that.

36:13.065 --> 36:15.066
Baby, we're gonna
work it out.

36:15.068 --> 36:16.403
It's gonna be okay.

36:18.505 --> 36:19.573
It's not.

36:28.181 --> 36:29.817
Go and get your stuff, baby.

36:31.918 --> 36:33.086
[Lena] <i>Gumman.</i>

36:35.088 --> 36:36.123
I'm fine.

36:38.123 --> 36:39.526
[Lena speaking Swedish]

36:44.664 --> 36:45.866
I don't know why.

36:47.199 --> 36:49.800
I just feel so fuck...

36:49.802 --> 36:50.869
[exhales sharply]

36:50.871 --> 36:52.836
Oh...

36:52.838 --> 36:56.643
<i>Älskling,</i> you don't
seem to be... coping.

36:57.744 --> 36:59.776
Because before when you were...

36:59.778 --> 37:01.579
Stop treating me
like a child, okay?

37:01.581 --> 37:04.452
- I'm an adult.
- Of course you are.

37:06.253 --> 37:07.988
I just had a moment.

37:08.688 --> 37:10.255
We're just concerned.

37:10.257 --> 37:12.856
Just stop fucking being
concerned about me all the time!

37:12.858 --> 37:14.858
It's driving me crazy!

37:14.860 --> 37:16.940
For Christ's sake, Lizzie,
this isn't just about you!

37:17.630 --> 37:18.699
You have a son.

37:19.900 --> 37:20.932
Because you're on edge
all the time,

37:20.934 --> 37:22.800
you're bad-tempered with him,

37:22.802 --> 37:24.137
you're forgetful.

37:25.271 --> 37:28.041
It isn't a healthy
environment for a child.

37:29.708 --> 37:33.213
[sighs] We thought
you were doing better.

37:36.081 --> 37:39.519
Well...
[exhales sharply] ...so did I.

37:43.155 --> 37:45.192
[soft music playing]

37:54.333 --> 37:56.769
My parents just called.
Thomas is sick.

37:57.670 --> 37:58.873
[scoffs]

37:59.773 --> 38:02.710
Really? Well,
what does he have?

38:04.010 --> 38:05.778
Or is he just plain sick?

38:06.813 --> 38:08.746
He's vomiting
and has a fever.

38:08.748 --> 38:10.847
I'm sorry,
but I really gotta go.

38:10.849 --> 38:12.182
[scoffs]

38:12.184 --> 38:13.851
For God's sake, Courtney,

38:13.853 --> 38:15.222
her kid is sick.
Just let her go.

38:19.358 --> 38:21.925
She can go.
Of course she can go.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.563
Thanks,
I appreciate it.

38:28.668 --> 38:30.668
[children chattering]

38:30.670 --> 38:31.805
[Claire]
He skates well.

38:33.306 --> 38:35.543
He comes
with his dad sometimes.

38:39.144 --> 38:42.880
Jeremy is not... bad.

38:42.882 --> 38:45.653
Oh, he tries.
[chuckles]

38:53.059 --> 38:54.628
How long
have you lived here?

38:55.762 --> 38:56.931
About ten years.

39:00.699 --> 39:01.835
So they're both born here?

39:02.902 --> 39:06.005
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
both at Landry Maternity.

39:07.039 --> 39:08.976
- [phone ringing]
- Oh, excuse me.

39:09.742 --> 39:10.911
Hi, Mum.

39:12.211 --> 39:13.980
Yeah, we're just
at the ice skating rink.

39:16.248 --> 39:17.750
Yeah,
they're doing well.

39:21.253 --> 39:24.088
Oh, yeah, we'll be over
on the weekend for sure.

39:24.090 --> 39:26.958
- Yeah, we can bring some more.
- [Thomas] Come on, Lola.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.797
[Claire] How about one o'clock?
Yeah, we can't wait to see you.

39:39.405 --> 39:40.641
Hey.

39:43.409 --> 39:44.811
[chuckles]

39:48.248 --> 39:50.717
No, no, I only just started
packing the kitchen.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.255
Yeah, I only just
got a few boxes.

39:58.257 --> 40:00.793
If you bend your knees a little
bit, you'll get steadier.

40:04.931 --> 40:06.211
- [Lizzie gasps]
- [Lola giggles]

40:07.900 --> 40:09.135
Want to hold my hand?

40:15.307 --> 40:18.045
Okay. Let's speed up.

40:22.981 --> 40:24.182
[giggles]

40:24.184 --> 40:25.686
Keep looking ahead.

40:34.360 --> 40:37.064
Should we try something?
You go in front.

40:55.514 --> 40:57.347
[gasps] No!

40:57.349 --> 40:59.117
[Lizzie gasps]

40:59.119 --> 41:00.688
Shit!

41:02.088 --> 41:03.157
Lola!

41:04.490 --> 41:06.891
- [gasps]
- Lola!

41:06.893 --> 41:09.013
- [Lizzie] Oh, my God.
- No, don't... Don't touch her.

41:10.496 --> 41:12.965
Are you okay?
Are you okay, honey?

41:13.867 --> 41:15.465
- [groans]
- [Lizzie] I'm so sorry.

41:15.467 --> 41:18.135
- Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
- Is she okay?

41:18.137 --> 41:20.838
The guy just shot out of nowhere.
Such an idiot.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.043
You were obviously
going too fast.

41:23.510 --> 41:24.878
[panting]

41:26.246 --> 41:28.981
It's just a bump.
It's just a bump, honey.

41:36.822 --> 41:38.826
I am so, so sorry.

41:42.128 --> 41:45.999
You have a tough little
trooper right there.

41:50.869 --> 41:52.371
I wanna make it up to you guys.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.776
No, it's fine.
It's okay.

41:57.510 --> 42:01.112
Um, I can take them off
your hands this weekend.

42:01.114 --> 42:02.750
I'm with Dad this weekend.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.322
Or any weekday afternoon.

42:13.393 --> 42:16.327
Um, you know, they have
so much going on already

42:16.329 --> 42:17.998
with the move
and everything, so...

42:19.565 --> 42:23.102
Sure.
Whatever works best for you.

42:25.871 --> 42:27.240
Yeah, we can...

42:28.507 --> 42:29.976
We'll just play it by ear.

42:31.143 --> 42:33.780
Come on, Jeremy.
You ready? Let's go.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.215
- Okay, see you.
- See you later.

42:45.557 --> 42:47.391
[exhales sharply]

42:47.393 --> 42:49.128
[whimpering]

43:19.092 --> 43:21.128
[toilet flushes]

43:37.043 --> 43:38.878
[man] How's your day-to-day?

43:41.581 --> 43:42.983
Much better.

43:44.317 --> 43:46.052
I try to relax more.

43:50.023 --> 43:54.894
The other day I played hooky from work.
I went ice skating with Thomas.

43:56.028 --> 44:00.630
[man chuckles] Well,
your secret is safe with me.

44:00.632 --> 44:02.034
[chuckles]

44:04.137 --> 44:05.505
[man]
And how are you both doing?

44:07.572 --> 44:08.608
He's great.

44:12.577 --> 44:13.880
[man]
I mean the two of you.

44:16.148 --> 44:20.219
Yeah, you know,
we're, uh, we're good.

44:21.521 --> 44:23.223
We're...
We're doing great.

44:24.690 --> 44:25.925
[man] Good.

44:30.195 --> 44:33.900
So do you find yourself
thinking less about Rosie?

44:40.172 --> 44:44.644
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, less and less.

44:45.677 --> 44:48.614
[man]
And the medication.

44:50.615 --> 44:52.052
Do you feel it's helping?

44:53.418 --> 44:55.221
Absolutely. Yeah.

45:12.405 --> 45:15.238
- All right, that one's definitely coming.
- [giggles] Yeah.

45:15.240 --> 45:18.208
Care Bear. Still coming?

45:18.210 --> 45:21.045
- Yeah.
- All right. What about Mr. Dinosaur?

45:21.047 --> 45:22.679
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

45:22.681 --> 45:24.280
- I don't know!
- Yeah.

45:24.282 --> 45:26.217
[both laugh]

45:26.219 --> 45:27.954
You have too many toys.

45:36.561 --> 45:39.229
Lola, can you grab me a glass of
water from the kitchen, please?

45:39.231 --> 45:40.266
Yeah.

46:09.628 --> 46:11.664
[chattering]

46:13.166 --> 46:15.298
- [woman] Just turn around.
- [girl] It's so tight...

46:15.300 --> 46:17.767
[woman 2] Need a couple
more pins in there.

46:17.769 --> 46:19.206
[girl 2] Mom, that's enough.

46:20.606 --> 46:22.743
You look like a real ballerina.

46:26.112 --> 46:27.681
I'm a bit scared,
Mum.

46:28.614 --> 46:31.715
Well, it's okay
to be a bit scared.

46:31.717 --> 46:35.119
But look, all the other girls
don't seem nervous.

46:35.121 --> 46:36.256
Well, I am.

46:38.590 --> 46:42.159
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to be sitting in the audience,

46:42.161 --> 46:44.595
- cheering you on with your dad and with Jezzy, yeah?
- [bell rings]

46:44.597 --> 46:46.396
- [woman] Come on, girls!
- [girl] Oh, let's go.

46:46.398 --> 46:48.199
Okay, go on. Go on.

46:48.201 --> 46:50.133
No, stay with me.

46:50.135 --> 46:52.369
But look,
all the other mums are going.

46:52.371 --> 46:53.851
[woman] Right, off you go.
Go get 'em.

46:58.478 --> 47:01.612
You are going to be
so amazing, yeah?

47:01.614 --> 47:03.613
You're my brave girl,
and you're going to be great,

47:03.615 --> 47:06.383
and then we're going to be with
you right afterwards, yeah?

47:06.385 --> 47:07.421
Okay, go on.

47:08.454 --> 47:10.557
Come on! Let's go.

47:14.427 --> 47:16.463
[ballet music playing]

47:23.668 --> 47:27.537
[whispering] Oh, excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.

47:27.539 --> 47:29.608
- She all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

47:37.682 --> 47:38.818
Oh, my God.

47:50.396 --> 47:51.461
[gasps]

47:51.463 --> 47:52.498
Hey, Lola.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.135
You okay?

47:58.905 --> 48:00.307
Wow.

48:01.306 --> 48:02.773
Oh, your shoes.

48:02.775 --> 48:04.211
They're so pretty.

48:05.811 --> 48:08.811
- I got them for my birthday.
- Really?

48:08.813 --> 48:09.815
Hmm.

48:10.650 --> 48:12.285
When is your birthday?

48:13.719 --> 48:15.255
I'm on next.

48:16.355 --> 48:17.655
[Lizzie] Don't be scared.

48:17.657 --> 48:19.126
[gasps]

48:19.858 --> 48:21.161
I'm here.

48:29.969 --> 48:31.737
[chuckles]

48:50.755 --> 48:52.291
[mouthing]

48:57.463 --> 48:58.598
What's she doing?

50:12.972 --> 50:15.575
[applause]

50:20.746 --> 50:22.249
- I'll get Lola.
- Okay.

50:27.820 --> 50:29.588
[panting]

50:36.795 --> 50:39.563
[chattering]

50:39.565 --> 50:41.097
[woman] Do you think
I should go back there?

50:41.099 --> 50:42.633
I would definitely.

50:42.635 --> 50:44.534
It'd be good
to get up there again.

50:44.536 --> 50:45.735
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi, sweetheart.

50:45.737 --> 50:47.273
Um, she's not backstage.

50:48.007 --> 50:51.278
Well, she's...
She'll be somewhere.

50:51.876 --> 50:53.976
Okay, I'll be back.
Sorry.

50:53.978 --> 50:55.014
No worries.

50:56.548 --> 50:58.581
Yeah, so I mean,
he did an incredible job for us.

50:58.583 --> 51:00.550
- [woman] It's probably not the best time.
- [Bernard] No, no.

51:00.552 --> 51:02.588
I mean, it's hard,
you know? Especially...

51:03.489 --> 51:04.655
Sorry,
would you excuse me?

51:04.657 --> 51:07.294
Lizzie! Hi.

51:08.027 --> 51:09.126
- Hi.
- [Bernard] How are you?

51:09.128 --> 51:10.626
Yeah, I'm good.

51:10.628 --> 51:13.496
Good. So you...

51:13.498 --> 51:15.334
you decided against the house?

51:15.967 --> 51:18.401
Yeah. Yeah,
we ran the numbers

51:18.403 --> 51:20.403
and just can't
swing the mortgage.

51:20.405 --> 51:23.407
- Right. Yeah.
- I'm so disappointed.

51:23.409 --> 51:25.708
- I love it. I got carried away.
- Oh.

51:25.710 --> 51:27.644
I feel so embarrassed.

51:27.646 --> 51:29.979
No, don't be embarrassed.
It's understandable.

51:29.981 --> 51:32.148
You know, it's life.

51:32.150 --> 51:35.952
Erm, we're actually having
a going away party,

51:35.954 --> 51:37.521
if you were interested.

51:37.523 --> 51:40.124
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Saturday week.

51:40.126 --> 51:43.494
- It should go on till quite late. Should be fun.
- Yeah.

51:43.496 --> 51:47.063
- Princess! Here she is!
- [Lola giggling]

51:47.065 --> 51:50.833
Oh, yes!
I'm so proud of you.

51:50.835 --> 51:52.068
[Lola] Did you like it?

51:52.070 --> 51:55.472
You were so good,
my love.

51:55.474 --> 51:57.907
[Claire]
You were so great. So good.

51:57.909 --> 52:00.744
- [Lola] Really? I was so nervous.
- Mmm.

52:00.746 --> 52:02.445
[Bernard laughs]

52:02.447 --> 52:03.813
Hi.

52:03.815 --> 52:05.784
Hi. We meet again.

52:07.085 --> 52:08.684
Is Thomas with you?

52:08.686 --> 52:11.458
I've gotta go
and pick him up now.

52:12.958 --> 52:14.527
Do you know someone here?

52:17.663 --> 52:20.967
I just love ballet.
And you were amazing.

52:21.900 --> 52:23.902
Did you see me
looking over at you?

52:26.172 --> 52:27.474
Mm-hmm.

52:30.842 --> 52:33.677
- I've gotta go.
- Sure.

52:33.679 --> 52:35.014
- [Lizzie] Bye.
- See you.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.653
That was odd.

52:43.655 --> 52:46.592
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

52:48.994 --> 52:50.760
You were so wonderful.

52:50.762 --> 52:52.563
You were so good.

52:52.565 --> 52:54.898
- Is somebody starving?
- [Lola] Yeah.

52:54.900 --> 52:57.137
- Starving to death?
- [Lola giggles] Yeah.

52:58.971 --> 53:01.007
[soft music playing]

53:02.708 --> 53:03.876
Okay.

53:08.179 --> 53:11.648
Wow, you have amazing skin.

53:11.650 --> 53:12.852
Great.

53:18.958 --> 53:20.427
[Claire] Can we talk?

53:22.260 --> 53:25.130
Sure. Now?

53:26.532 --> 53:27.767
Preferably, yes.

53:31.237 --> 53:34.838
All right. Alice?

53:34.840 --> 53:37.443
- Mm-hmm.
- Cover things for a few minutes?

54:09.041 --> 54:11.110
You never intended
on buying the house.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.018
I'm trying to work it out.

54:22.721 --> 54:24.023
Work out what?

54:31.329 --> 54:34.132
I lost my baby daughter
seven years ago.

54:41.039 --> 54:43.876
I didn't know.
I'm... I'm sorry.

54:46.679 --> 54:47.881
She died.

54:49.748 --> 54:50.983
In a fire.

54:53.918 --> 54:55.721
At Bryant Hospital.

54:59.123 --> 55:00.859
Why are you telling me this?

55:03.295 --> 55:08.034
Because every time I see Lola,
I'm more convinced.

55:09.835 --> 55:11.538
Convinced of what?

55:11.971 --> 55:14.170
[breathes shakily]

55:14.172 --> 55:17.042
I'm pretty sure
she's my daughter.

55:18.010 --> 55:19.278
[scoffs]

55:22.748 --> 55:25.148
[scoffs]
That's crazy.

55:25.150 --> 55:28.952
Hmm? You can't deny
that she looks like me.

55:28.954 --> 55:31.291
You think
Lola is your daughter?

55:33.759 --> 55:36.262
And what brings you
to that conclusion?

55:38.731 --> 55:40.233
I just feel it.

55:42.134 --> 55:43.700
I think you have a problem.

55:43.702 --> 55:45.235
Something happened.

55:45.237 --> 55:47.574
No. No, I don't
want to hear anymore.

55:48.373 --> 55:51.307
This is nuts.
You know that, don't you?

55:51.309 --> 55:54.945
At the hospital, in the
fire, in the confusion...

55:54.947 --> 55:57.414
Look, I'm sure that whatever
happened to you was very painful,

55:57.416 --> 55:59.085
but Lola is my daughter.

56:03.155 --> 56:06.225
[exhales sharply] I can't
believe I just had to say that.

56:11.329 --> 56:12.896
I don't know
about that hospital,

56:12.898 --> 56:14.701
and I don't know
about any fire.

56:15.701 --> 56:18.338
Okay? Lola was born
at Landry Maternity.

56:20.972 --> 56:23.710
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but I can't help you.

56:29.347 --> 56:30.782
I think
you need therapy.

56:36.288 --> 56:38.925
I don't think our boys
should play together anymore.

56:45.431 --> 56:48.735
And you need to stay away
from my family.

57:01.346 --> 57:03.382
[crying]

57:08.086 --> 57:09.853
[Bernard] I don't think
that proves anything.

57:09.855 --> 57:11.420
Susan doesn't spread gossip.

57:11.422 --> 57:13.389
She said it wasn't
just a little time off.

57:13.391 --> 57:16.459
She said Lizzie was
committed for almost a year.

57:16.461 --> 57:19.132
Yeah, but my love,
she lost a baby.

57:19.898 --> 57:20.932
Imagine.

57:22.134 --> 57:23.670
No, I can't imagine it.

57:26.105 --> 57:27.807
I think we should
call the police.

57:30.108 --> 57:34.010
Look, the point is,
there's no law against being crazy, okay?

57:34.012 --> 57:36.045
People can say
whatever they wanna say.

57:36.047 --> 57:40.085
I need you to hear me.
She is stalking our family.

57:41.920 --> 57:44.887
Looking through our front gate

57:44.889 --> 57:50.395
when we've got a "for sale" sign
up out there is not stalking.

57:51.362 --> 57:52.762
Come on.
And, you know,

57:52.764 --> 57:56.032
the other places,
the... the ice skating,

57:56.034 --> 57:57.867
I mean,
you invited her to that.

57:57.869 --> 58:00.369
And the ballet?
They're public places.

58:00.371 --> 58:02.037
None of it
constitutes stalking.

58:02.039 --> 58:03.807
The cops are not going to
do anything about it.

58:03.809 --> 58:05.441
So we're just
supposed to do nothing?

58:05.443 --> 58:08.411
No, we don't do nothing.
We just don't overreact.

58:08.413 --> 58:09.512
I'm not overreacting.

58:09.514 --> 58:10.982
You are.

58:12.483 --> 58:17.320
We lock the doors.
We put the alarm on.

58:17.322 --> 58:18.921
[children giggling]

58:18.923 --> 58:22.295
Darling, it's okay.

58:27.231 --> 58:28.934
[softly] Okay.

58:37.309 --> 58:39.345
- [soft music playing]
- [chattering]

58:40.545 --> 58:42.748
You walked out
on a shift.

58:43.548 --> 58:45.514
Best of luck
for your future endeavors.

58:45.516 --> 58:47.516
Thanks.

58:47.518 --> 58:49.921
Let's hope you're a better
parent than you are an employee.

58:55.460 --> 58:56.496
[gasps]

59:02.201 --> 59:03.802
You're hurting me.

59:06.271 --> 59:07.406
[groans]

59:16.047 --> 59:17.149
[Alice]
Lizzie, come on.

59:20.918 --> 59:21.985
[sighs]

59:21.987 --> 59:24.023
[inaudible]

59:26.592 --> 59:29.959
[Lizzie] Okay, so that's done.
What else can I do for you?

59:29.961 --> 59:32.362
Uh, could you grab
some more buns, please?

59:32.364 --> 59:34.164
- Yeah, sure.
- And some veggie burgers?

59:34.166 --> 59:36.233
- Okay, you got it.
- Thank you.

59:36.235 --> 59:38.271
[children chattering, laughing]

01:00:22.246 --> 01:00:23.449
[gasps]

01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:33.523
Hey, thanks for looking after the kids.
It's officially madness here.

01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:36.693
- [woman] <i>Okay then, no worries. We're coping.</i>
- How are they doing?

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:40.329
Well, they are loading up on sugar.
You'll have fun tonight.

01:00:40.331 --> 01:00:43.333
[Claire] <i>Oh. Well, you make sure they
eat a burger or something, will you?</i>

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:46.702
- [Ellen] <i>Yeah.</i>
- Actually, are they handy? Can I say hi?

01:00:46.704 --> 01:00:49.505
Uh, well, Jeremy's playing
soccer with his friends,

01:00:49.507 --> 01:00:51.708
and Lola went for a walk
with your friend.

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:57.213
- My friend?
- [Ellen] <i>Yeah. The nice one. Lizzie.</i>

01:00:57.215 --> 01:00:59.385
- What?
- <i>She was gonna buy your house.</i>

01:01:00.485 --> 01:01:02.151
Wait, is that...
is that okay?

01:01:02.153 --> 01:01:05.123
No.
Um, no, it's not okay.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.356
She seems really nice.

01:01:07.358 --> 01:01:09.458
[Claire]
<i>Listen, I'm coming, okay?</i>

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.260
Claire, I'm sure it's fine.

01:01:11.262 --> 01:01:12.729
<i>Um, do you want me to...</i>

01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:15.001
Yes. No. Uh... Fuck.

01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:18.568
Look, uh,
I'll handle it, okay?

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:20.539
I can't believe you let her
go on a walk with her.

01:01:33.518 --> 01:01:34.619
Do you wanna know a secret?

01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:41.393
I had
a little girl once.

01:01:42.728 --> 01:01:44.163
A little baby.

01:01:47.032 --> 01:01:48.601
What happened to her?

01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:53.405
She...

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.009
She was in an accident.

01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:12.057
I loved her very much.

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:21.133
[sighing]

01:02:23.235 --> 01:02:24.603
Do you love your mommy?

01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:32.611
She loves you too.

01:02:37.715 --> 01:02:39.184
Oh, shit.

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:42.684
Come on, fucking move!

01:02:42.686 --> 01:02:45.324
[honking]

01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:49.161
[tires screeching]

01:02:52.097 --> 01:02:53.466
Do you know what this is?

01:02:57.235 --> 01:02:58.704
It's the mark of an angel.

01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:05.710
When the baby
is in its mommy's womb...

01:03:07.112 --> 01:03:08.610
it knows all the answers

01:03:08.612 --> 01:03:10.648
to all the mysteries
in the whole world.

01:03:13.117 --> 01:03:15.485
Then, just before it's born,

01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:19.692
an angel places its finger
on the baby's mouth.

01:03:20.659 --> 01:03:22.294
Shh.

01:03:25.163 --> 01:03:27.333
And the child
forgets everything.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.637
That's why we've all got
this little indent.

01:03:37.175 --> 01:03:38.244
Yes.

01:03:40.144 --> 01:03:41.447
That's it. [laughs]

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:49.121
All the answers
are in us.

01:03:50.889 --> 01:03:56.195
But we have to be very quiet
and very still to remember them.

01:04:17.715 --> 01:04:19.085
Do you remember me?

01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:39.704
[breathing shakily]

01:04:45.809 --> 01:04:48.413
[panting]

01:04:50.648 --> 01:04:52.916
[children clamoring]

01:04:52.918 --> 01:04:54.316
[Ellen] There you go.

01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:56.619
- Hi. Where is she?
- Hey!

01:04:56.621 --> 01:04:58.921
Uh, she's around here
somewhere.

01:04:58.923 --> 01:05:01.126
- Where?
- She just came back.

01:05:04.563 --> 01:05:06.396
Oh, there she is.

01:05:06.398 --> 01:05:08.463
God, sorry.
You must think I'm mad.

01:05:08.465 --> 01:05:12.401
Not at all, I'm so sorry.
She seemed really nice.

01:05:12.403 --> 01:05:13.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:13.938 --> 01:05:16.706
- Are you good?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:16.708 --> 01:05:18.441
What have you been doing?

01:05:18.443 --> 01:05:20.412
I went on a boat ride
with Lizzie.

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:24.716
Oh. Right.

01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:27.219
Um...

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.159
What did...
What did you talk about?

01:05:35.827 --> 01:05:37.163
Angels.

01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:39.798
Angels. Okay.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.304
Did you talk about
anything else?

01:05:47.938 --> 01:05:49.274
Babies.

01:05:50.574 --> 01:05:51.676
Babies.

01:05:53.945 --> 01:05:55.247
Um...

01:05:56.014 --> 01:06:00.486
Honey, did she...

01:06:01.385 --> 01:06:02.755
Did she touch you at all?

01:06:07.425 --> 01:06:08.460
No.

01:06:09.293 --> 01:06:10.461
You sure?

01:06:12.297 --> 01:06:15.201
Yeah? Okay.

01:06:16.635 --> 01:06:19.369
- And you talked about angels?
- Yeah.

01:06:19.371 --> 01:06:20.739
Right, well, that's nice.

01:06:24.476 --> 01:06:25.611
I'm here.

01:06:27.878 --> 01:06:31.317
I had to cover at work. Sorry.

01:06:33.018 --> 01:06:34.320
Hello, Lizzie.

01:06:36.721 --> 01:06:40.659
What are you doing here?
And what are you doing here?

01:06:41.626 --> 01:06:42.828
The school called me.

01:06:44.996 --> 01:06:47.463
You didn't pick me up
from soccer practice.

01:06:47.465 --> 01:06:48.731
[Lizzie sighs]

01:06:48.733 --> 01:06:50.568
Tommy, why don't you
go upstairs?

01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:53.472
All right? Go on.

01:06:54.338 --> 01:06:55.873
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:07:03.681 --> 01:07:05.483
- [door closes]
- [ex-husband] Lizzie.

01:07:07.585 --> 01:07:09.288
You know things have to change.

01:07:10.487 --> 01:07:11.820
Thomas is at an age. He just...

01:07:11.822 --> 01:07:14.057
It was a work emergency.

01:07:14.059 --> 01:07:16.262
There's always
an excuse, Lizzie.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:20.599
Mom?

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:22.668
Dad?

01:07:23.568 --> 01:07:25.400
Come on!

01:07:25.402 --> 01:07:27.305
You know things are better.

01:07:28.873 --> 01:07:32.541
Lizzie, we all
care about you.

01:07:32.543 --> 01:07:34.879
- We want to support your healing process.
- Oh, God.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.481
We feel that your best chance
for full recovery

01:07:38.483 --> 01:07:41.287
will come with the benefit
of another inpatient program.

01:07:42.487 --> 01:07:43.885
It's only temporary.

01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:45.290
[sighs]

01:07:47.057 --> 01:07:50.561
I mean, I... I'm...
[stutters]

01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:56.501
What about Thomas?
What about work?

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:03.409
Alice called.
She told us you lost your job.

01:08:04.509 --> 01:08:06.909
[laughs] What?

01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:09.512
She called you?
She fucking called you?

01:08:09.514 --> 01:08:13.052
She said she'd sent you tons of messages.
What else could she have done?

01:08:15.085 --> 01:08:18.653
I'm dealing with everything just fine.
It's just everyone else that...

01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:21.393
Listen to yourself.
Everyone else?

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:24.328
You're just not there for him.

01:08:34.471 --> 01:08:36.075
- I wanna talk to him.
- Wait.

01:08:41.645 --> 01:08:44.946
When you came back...
from that hospital,

01:08:44.948 --> 01:08:47.353
I don't think
you ever really came back.

01:08:49.587 --> 01:08:50.823
That's not fair.

01:08:56.895 --> 01:09:02.968
[exhales sharply] Okay.
Uh, look, I appreciate everyone's concern.

01:09:07.572 --> 01:09:09.875
The truth is that I, um...

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:18.384
I've been focused on a...
situation that's come up.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:26.390
It's actually kind of...
incredible.

01:09:28.591 --> 01:09:31.697
I know this might sound crazy.
I know.

01:09:33.198 --> 01:09:39.604
But I happened to meet
this little girl.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:45.010
And I... I don't know
for sure yet.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.518
There's a very strong
likelihood...

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.021
that it's Rosie.

01:10:03.161 --> 01:10:05.063
- Sweet love.
- Yeah.

01:10:06.997 --> 01:10:08.065
Yeah?

01:10:08.899 --> 01:10:10.067
She's dead.

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.268
Our Rosie is dead.

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:15.103
No, you don't know that.

01:10:15.105 --> 01:10:16.175
Please don't say that.

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:19.107
I'm trying to move on.

01:10:19.109 --> 01:10:24.213
I've been trying,
but maybe there's a reason why I can't.

01:10:24.215 --> 01:10:27.886
I can't explain it,
but I can feel it.

01:10:30.054 --> 01:10:32.858
Mike, it could be her.

01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:36.060
It could be our daughter.

01:10:37.595 --> 01:10:41.766
Lizzie,
when will this end?

01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:46.168
Well, if you hadn't
had her cremated back then,

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.704
it could have ended with an
autopsy, and we would have realized

01:10:48.706 --> 01:10:51.107
that it wasn't our
daughter who was dead!

01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:53.142
You think I had a choice?

01:10:53.144 --> 01:10:54.744
You should have been there!

01:10:54.746 --> 01:10:56.211
You should have been
with me that night!

01:10:56.213 --> 01:10:57.983
You told me to go home
with Thomas!

01:11:01.252 --> 01:11:04.623
Lizzie, just stop! Please.

01:11:05.122 --> 01:11:06.157
Stop.

01:11:10.328 --> 01:11:12.631
We have been over this
a thousand times.

01:11:13.297 --> 01:11:15.634
Whatever it is
you're feeling...

01:11:16.935 --> 01:11:18.103
I feel for you.

01:11:19.737 --> 01:11:21.737
But you're not the only one
that went through this.

01:11:23.608 --> 01:11:24.743
I did too.

01:11:28.011 --> 01:11:29.847
But you're still stuck
back there.

01:11:32.082 --> 01:11:33.652
Why do you think
I had to leave?

01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:41.994
And now
Thomas is being affected.

01:11:43.328 --> 01:11:44.563
How?

01:11:46.331 --> 01:11:48.731
You make him
celebrate her birthday.

01:11:48.733 --> 01:11:50.633
I'm not making him!

01:11:50.635 --> 01:11:52.715
Please don't make me take
him away from you for good.

01:11:55.806 --> 01:11:57.074
It's not what I want.

01:11:58.976 --> 01:12:00.679
But I'm taking him
this week.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.916
For now.

01:12:09.252 --> 01:12:11.687
- Are you two happy now?
- Damn it, Lizzie.

01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:14.690
You've gotta stop living with a ghost.
She's not coming back. Accept it!

01:12:14.692 --> 01:12:19.027
She is still alive!
I can feel it! I'm her mother!

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:21.964
- I'm her fucking mother! I would know!
- Elisabet.

01:12:21.966 --> 01:12:23.635
[speaking Swedish]

01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:27.937
Elisabet.

01:12:27.939 --> 01:12:29.274
You don't believe me.

01:12:36.046 --> 01:12:37.148
[sighs]

01:12:38.082 --> 01:12:39.685
Oh, Lizzie!

01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:45.824
- Lizzie!
- Lena!

- [music playing]
- [chattering]

01:15:35.193 --> 01:15:36.427
You looking for
the bathroom?

01:15:37.328 --> 01:15:39.898
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:15:41.231 --> 01:15:42.367
It's just through there.

01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:44.269
Thanks.

01:15:52.976 --> 01:15:54.378
[exhales]

01:16:20.604 --> 01:16:22.106
What are you doing here?

01:16:23.474 --> 01:16:25.342
Your husband invited me.

01:16:26.109 --> 01:16:28.576
You need to leave my house.

01:16:28.578 --> 01:16:31.882
I'll pay for a DNA test.
It's the only way.

01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:34.549
Excuse me?

01:16:34.551 --> 01:16:36.320
I know what I know.

01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:38.390
God!

01:16:40.658 --> 01:16:43.592
- I want my daughter back.
- Get out!

01:16:43.594 --> 01:16:46.160
You're sick.
Do you understand that?

01:16:46.162 --> 01:16:49.164
You need to leave my family
alone once and for all, okay?

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:52.567
We are now officially
in restraining order territory.

01:16:52.569 --> 01:16:55.539
You need to get the fuck off my
property before I call the police.

01:17:09.287 --> 01:17:12.257
[panting] Fuck.

01:17:14.692 --> 01:17:18.294
- You okay? Was that her?
- Yeah, it was.

01:17:18.296 --> 01:17:20.262
[Bernard] I thought you called
her and told her not to come.

01:17:20.264 --> 01:17:22.064
- [breathes deeply]
- [Claire] I did call her.

01:17:24.601 --> 01:17:26.070
[door closes]

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.016
[vehicle passing]

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.352
- [man] Okay, here's our Uber!
- [Claire] Bye, guys!

01:17:44.354 --> 01:17:46.321
- [woman] Thanks for the party!
- [man] Great party.

01:17:46.323 --> 01:17:48.057
- [Bernard] Thanks for coming.
- [Claire] See ya.

01:17:48.059 --> 01:17:49.625
Come visit us in Perth.

01:17:49.627 --> 01:17:51.360
- [man] Yeah, we will.
- [woman] Safe travels.

01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:53.128
- [man] Love you guys.
- [woman] We'll miss you.

01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:55.033

01:18:12.182 --> 01:18:14.219
[dishes clattering]

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.722
- [Claire] Pass the platters?
- [Bernard] Sure. Just leave them. I'll get them.

01:18:19.724 --> 01:18:21.656
[Claire] No,
I'm just gonna rinse them off.

01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:24.058
[Bernard] Okay. Come on.
Let's do the rest in the morning.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.530
[Claire] Okay.
Can you lock the back?

01:19:08.538 --> 01:19:09.974
[Bernard]
Come to bed, my love!

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.255
- [Claire] I'm just setting the alarm.
- [beeps]

01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:15.110
[beeping]

01:19:15.112 --> 01:19:16.547
[gasps]

01:20:23.613 --> 01:20:24.648
[exhales]

01:20:40.197 --> 01:20:42.132
[Bernard] Can I just say,

01:20:42.699 --> 01:20:47.468
I am so, so sorry

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:51.874
that I didn't take you more seriously
about how crazy she is, okay?

01:20:51.876 --> 01:20:55.177
And look, you were right.

01:20:55.179 --> 01:20:58.649
I should have done something when
she took her out on the boat.

01:20:59.682 --> 01:21:01.782
Tomorrow morning,
after I pick up the kids,

01:21:01.784 --> 01:21:03.585
we're going to go to
the police station

01:21:03.587 --> 01:21:06.524
and we will get
a restraining order, okay?

01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:08.525
[Claire] Thanks.

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:16.201
[birds chirping]

01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:24.341
[snoring lightly]

01:21:35.252 --> 01:21:37.288

01:21:40.457 --> 01:21:42.360
[footsteps approaching]

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.340
[Bernard] I'm going to
get the kids, sweetheart.

01:21:45.662 --> 01:21:46.697
Okay.

01:21:47.765 --> 01:21:48.845
[Bernard]
Anything you need?

01:21:50.234 --> 01:21:51.402
No, just them.

01:22:02.546 --> 01:22:05.316
- [door closes]
- [gasping]

01:23:43.413 --> 01:23:44.983

01:23:49.953 --> 01:23:51.723
[grunting, groaning]

01:23:53.356 --> 01:23:55.792
[grunting]

01:24:05.636 --> 01:24:06.871
[screams]

01:24:39.703 --> 01:24:43.641
You broke into my home,
and you attacked me.

01:24:44.774 --> 01:24:47.511
- I could fucking end this right now.
- Stab me.

01:24:48.078 --> 01:24:50.478
- Stab me!
- Listen to me!

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.048
You are going to walk
out of my life right now.

01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:58.018
No, I'm not. You have to kill
me 'cause I'm never gonna stop.

01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.056
God!

01:25:00.823 --> 01:25:02.124
I know what I know.

01:25:02.126 --> 01:25:03.594
And what is that?

01:25:06.162 --> 01:25:09.800
You have no idea
what it's like to lose a child.

01:25:11.467 --> 01:25:15.072
To spend every day
missing a piece of yourself.

01:25:16.105 --> 01:25:19.643
To live with a grief
that never goes away.

01:25:21.578 --> 01:25:24.682
I... I lost my baby girl.

01:25:27.518 --> 01:25:29.918
I lost my husband.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.890
My marriage. My son
is being taken away from me.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.491
I lost my job.

01:25:36.493 --> 01:25:38.058
I can't even go on a date.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:42.097
I can't laugh,
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

01:25:42.099 --> 01:25:45.369
I used to be funny.
I used to be funny.

01:25:45.969 --> 01:25:47.637
You're out of your mind.

01:25:51.207 --> 01:25:55.612
That's what everyone's been saying...
for seven years.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.580
But I...

01:25:58.582 --> 01:26:01.782
I know what's mine.

01:26:01.784 --> 01:26:04.986
No. Nothing is yours.

01:26:04.988 --> 01:26:06.620
I'm gonna prove it.

01:26:06.622 --> 01:26:08.956
I'm gonna hunt you down
and prove it.

01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:11.492
- You better get the fuck out of my house!
- I'm never gonna stop.

01:26:11.494 --> 01:26:14.795
- Get out!
- I'm gonna get that DNA

01:26:14.797 --> 01:26:18.933
and your disgusting,
ugly secret is gonna come out,

01:26:18.935 --> 01:26:21.001
and everyone is gonna know
what you really are.

01:26:21.003 --> 01:26:24.108
Get out.
[sniffling]

01:26:25.141 --> 01:26:26.810
Get out.

01:26:30.713 --> 01:26:33.917
You were there.
At the hospital.

01:26:38.555 --> 01:26:41.790
Don't you fucking lie to me!
Don't lie to me!

01:26:41.792 --> 01:26:44.726
I want the whole fucking world
to know what you are!

01:26:44.728 --> 01:26:47.128
That you're a thief
and a fucking liar.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:48.729
- I'm not!
- You stole my child.

01:26:48.731 --> 01:26:50.531
- You stole my baby.
- [crying] No.

01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:54.971
No, I saved her.
I saved her.

01:26:55.838 --> 01:26:57.108
[gasps]

01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:01.746
I saved her
because I lost my baby.

01:27:03.814 --> 01:27:07.985
I lost my child to the fire.
She choked to death.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.622
Oh, fuck!

01:27:12.055 --> 01:27:13.958
[sobbing]

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.263
I saw a dead woman on the floor.
I didn't see your face.

01:27:21.265 --> 01:27:23.634
There were flames
and smoke everywhere.

01:27:30.841 --> 01:27:33.511
I already had milk
in my breasts.

01:27:39.115 --> 01:27:41.051
I lost my baby...

01:27:42.886 --> 01:27:45.156
and another one
needed me.

01:27:46.088 --> 01:27:48.926
I didn't even see it.
I heard it.

01:27:53.796 --> 01:27:54.831
Her.

01:27:55.998 --> 01:28:00.604
You heard her.

01:28:01.872 --> 01:28:04.839
Her. Lola.

01:28:04.841 --> 01:28:08.012
No. My Rosie.

01:28:13.984 --> 01:28:16.217
I was alone
for the birth.

01:28:16.219 --> 01:28:19.823
Bernie wasn't there.
I didn't have anyone.

01:28:20.923 --> 01:28:25.595
He doesn't know Lola isn't his.
Please.

01:28:26.662 --> 01:28:28.265
Please don't
take her from me.

01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:34.271
Please.

01:28:35.338 --> 01:28:36.707
[Lola] Mummy?

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:38.975
Oh...

01:28:47.884 --> 01:28:51.021
In the car, kids.
Okay. It's all right.

01:28:51.688 --> 01:28:53.557
I'm s-sorry.

01:28:56.359 --> 01:28:58.093
[door closes]

01:28:58.095 --> 01:28:59.564
[Claire] I'm sorry.

01:29:16.279 --> 01:29:17.682
[door closes]

01:29:19.882 --> 01:29:21.918
[inaudible]

01:29:42.038 --> 01:29:43.206
Is it true?

01:29:49.779 --> 01:29:50.947
I'm so sorry.

01:29:54.917 --> 01:29:57.152
It's her.
I found her.

01:29:57.154 --> 01:29:58.189
Rosie.

01:30:03.393 --> 01:30:05.630
[birds chirping]

01:30:12.335 --> 01:30:14.204
- Want some lemonade, Tom?
- Yeah.

01:30:31.454 --> 01:30:35.925
Um, so, how often is she
going to be staying with us?

01:30:38.761 --> 01:30:42.766
Um, we don't know yet, babe.
We're still working it all out.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.202
Maybe just a little bit
at first.

01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.402
[Thomas] Cool.

01:30:48.404 --> 01:30:51.375
At least for now,
until Claire's trial is over.

01:30:52.475 --> 01:30:55.311
But you're her mother.
She should live with you.

01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.317
- And Mike, too, of course.
- Hmm.

01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:02.153
[man] Hello?

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.789
You ready?

01:31:09.292 --> 01:31:10.728
[Lizzie sighs]

01:31:22.338 --> 01:31:23.373
Hi.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.015
Hi.

01:31:33.283 --> 01:31:34.351
Hi.

01:31:36.386 --> 01:31:38.122
I'm so happy you're here.

01:31:48.265 --> 01:31:49.467
Hello, Lola.

01:31:51.368 --> 01:31:53.003
It's very lovely
to meet you.

01:31:55.471 --> 01:31:59.143
I'm... I'm Mike.

01:32:00.877 --> 01:32:01.979
Hi, Mike.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.349
Hi.

01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:36.247
Um... would you
like to come inside?

01:32:41.184 --> 01:32:42.219
Yeah?

01:32:46.523 --> 01:32:49.193
Um, I got an idea.

01:32:50.426 --> 01:32:53.797
Would you like Jeremy to come
with you this first time?

01:32:59.603 --> 01:33:01.505
Hmm?
Thomas is out the back.

01:33:05.108 --> 01:33:07.275
Uh, yeah. That's...
That'd be fine.

01:33:07.277 --> 01:33:10.010
Jez, do you wanna come and hang
with Thomas and Lola for a bit?

01:33:10.012 --> 01:33:12.479
- Yeah.
- Okay, good boy.

01:33:12.481 --> 01:33:13.984
Yeah.

01:33:21.024 --> 01:33:22.257
[Thomas]
This is Grandma.

01:33:22.259 --> 01:33:25.626
Hello.
My name is Lena.

01:33:25.628 --> 01:33:29.300
It's so lovely to meet you.
So lovely.

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.599
- Hi, Lola.
- [Lola] Hi.

01:33:32.601 --> 01:33:34.572
I'm Carl,
your grandpa.
