00:06.430 --> 00:08.131
Yo, man, something
ain't right about this.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.099
It's right.

00:09.101 --> 00:10.466
You know who leaves
a ride like this

00:10.468 --> 00:11.801
in the middle of this street

00:11.803 --> 00:13.303
at this time of night, man?
Cops. Let's go!

00:13.305 --> 00:14.637
Car's too nice
to be cops.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.805
Man, like you know.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.191
I know more than you.
Let's go.

00:21.529 --> 00:24.447
Hey, hold up, hold up.

00:26.702 --> 00:27.834
Askin' for it.

00:27.836 --> 00:30.036
Let me drive.

00:30.038 --> 00:31.671
You said I could drive.

00:33.674 --> 00:35.375
Damn, it's keyless.

00:35.377 --> 00:38.562
That clicker thing must be in here
somewhere. You see it?

00:38.564 --> 00:39.896
I'll look for it.

00:39.898 --> 00:41.497
I don't see it, man.
Try it anyway.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.050
Come on.

00:45.037 --> 00:47.670
Oh, yeah!

00:47.672 --> 00:49.389
Whoo!

00:50.842 --> 00:54.561
Yo, you hear that?
What was that?

01:02.069 --> 01:03.186
Oh, my gosh, man.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.321
Hell, no.

01:04.322 --> 01:06.239
Shut up, let me think.
Come on, man, we gotta go!

01:06.241 --> 01:09.025
No, we gotta go, man.
If we get stopped, I'm not explainin'

01:09.027 --> 01:11.077
why there's two dead white
people in the trunk. Let's go!

01:11.079 --> 01:12.746
All right!

01:12.748 --> 01:14.581
This is what
we gonna do--

01:14.583 --> 01:16.132
we're gonna
dump the bodies,

01:16.134 --> 01:18.201
wipe down the trunk,
and no one will ever know.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.719
Nuh-uh, man, we gotta go.
Come on!

01:19.721 --> 01:21.371
Will you look! Look!

01:21.373 --> 01:23.974
Whoever did this
left the key in her hand.

01:23.976 --> 01:25.041
Now, they dead and
I'm sorry about that,

01:25.043 --> 01:26.876
but they ain't
gettin' in my way.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.178
Are you down?

01:28.180 --> 01:29.879
Eddie! You down?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.047
Yeah, I'm down.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.900
Good. Now grab that thing
out of her hand.

01:33.902 --> 01:35.268
Me? Why I gotta grab it?

01:35.270 --> 01:36.937
Because I'm your big brother
and driving is my job,

01:36.939 --> 01:40.273
and taking stuff off
of dead bodies is yours.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.911
Hurry up.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.915
Aah!

01:48.917 --> 01:50.083
Let go!
Brendon! Brendon!

01:50.085 --> 01:51.585
Brendon!
Help me...

01:51.587 --> 01:53.069
Brendon!
Help me!

01:53.071 --> 01:55.038
Let go of her hand!
Let go!

01:55.040 --> 01:57.791
No...

01:57.793 --> 01:59.742
Run!

Hey, you.

02:19.948 --> 02:22.899
Hey. Next time
I decide

02:22.901 --> 02:26.152
if I want to keep working
at Doctors Without Borders,

02:26.154 --> 02:27.120
please shoot me.

02:27.122 --> 02:28.755
What country are you in
right now?

02:28.757 --> 02:31.107
Right now,
all I see is sand.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.810
So, south...

02:33.812 --> 02:35.478
Sandistan, I think.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.463
Mm...

02:36.465 --> 02:38.781
When are you
gonna get home?

02:38.783 --> 02:43.470
They kept me out here
for 10 months. Who knows?

02:44.973 --> 02:46.339
Do you need to get that?

02:46.341 --> 02:48.058
Mm-mmm.
No, not right now.

02:49.311 --> 02:50.477
You sure?

02:50.479 --> 02:53.480
Maybe you have to
sign for something.

03:05.493 --> 03:07.277
Special delivery.

03:08.162 --> 03:09.979
Hey.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.148
Ohh!

03:12.150 --> 03:13.316
Ohh...

03:13.318 --> 03:15.168
This is a treat.

03:15.170 --> 03:17.337
You never surprise me
at home.

03:17.339 --> 03:20.507
How'd you get the time off?

03:32.153 --> 03:35.021
James?

03:40.010 --> 03:41.444
You can stop faking.

03:41.446 --> 03:44.864
When you're really asleep,
you do that leg twitch thing.

03:44.866 --> 03:48.017
No, I don't.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.202
Hmm.

03:53.657 --> 03:55.658
Mmm.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.495
What's going on?

03:58.497 --> 03:59.879
'Cause there's something.

03:59.881 --> 04:02.665
Why does there
have to be something?

04:02.667 --> 04:05.701
Can't I just want
to make my wife happy?

04:05.703 --> 04:08.138
It's nothing.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.389
It's a good thing.

04:09.391 --> 04:10.890
So there is a thing.

04:10.892 --> 04:13.393
Yes. But I've been
in an airplane for 20 hours,

04:13.395 --> 04:15.729
and we're not gonna
talk about this right now.

04:15.731 --> 04:19.015
And I also just heard
your phone go off.

04:19.017 --> 04:22.101
That means you've got
a psycho killer to catch.

04:22.103 --> 04:24.354
We aren't done talking
about this.

04:24.356 --> 04:26.773
Shh. I'm sleeping.

04:26.775 --> 04:28.408
Look.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.610
Oh...

04:35.082 --> 04:38.785
It looks like someone is taking
the term "Motor City" too literally.

04:38.787 --> 04:40.120
In the last month,

04:40.122 --> 04:42.589
Detroit P.D. has found
two different crime scenes

04:42.591 --> 04:44.457
in the trunks
of two different cars.

04:44.459 --> 04:46.259
Married couples
in each trunk?

04:46.261 --> 04:48.077
Yeah. Brian and Melissa Cain
in car number one,

04:48.079 --> 04:49.596
Paul and Elizabeth Garrett
in car number two.

04:49.598 --> 04:52.248
Elizabeth was found alive
by a couple of kids,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.594
but by the time
the paramedics got there,

04:53.619 --> 04:54.918
she had lost too much blood.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.637
Well, it takes a lot of skill
to force a couple into their own car,

04:57.639 --> 04:58.972
even with a gun.

04:58.974 --> 05:01.024
But once he does, it's one-stop
shopping for this guy.

05:01.026 --> 05:04.144
His car become an abduction vehicle
and a dumping site.

05:04.146 --> 05:05.428
According to missing persons
reports,

05:05.430 --> 05:06.762
he holds on to them
for about a week.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.264
Do you know what he does
with them during that time?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.233
Yes, unfortunately I do,
and that information

05:10.235 --> 05:12.202
is on your tablets
in picture form.

05:12.204 --> 05:15.955
And if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go to my happy place.

05:15.957 --> 05:17.073
Ah.

05:17.075 --> 05:19.075
Wow, this guy sure likes
to cut, doesn't he?

05:19.077 --> 05:21.244
Mostly shallow.
They could almost

05:21.246 --> 05:22.579
be considered hesitation marks,

05:22.581 --> 05:24.614
except for the sheer number.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.550
M.E. puts the count
at nearly 50 per victim,

05:27.552 --> 05:30.420
and the cause of death
is one final stab that's fatal.

05:30.422 --> 05:32.455
Physical
and psychological sadism.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.425
They never know if the next cut
is the one that will kill them.

05:35.427 --> 05:36.959
And the amount
of urban decay in Detroit

05:36.961 --> 05:38.461
gives him a lot of room
to maneuver.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.463
We need to stop him before
he takes another couple.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.467
Oh, God.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.820
Oh, God...

05:46.822 --> 05:49.656
It's ok. It's ok.
It's all right. Just hang on.

05:49.658 --> 05:51.524
Why is he doing this
to us?

05:51.526 --> 05:54.160
I don't know, I don't.
Shh. Shh.

05:54.162 --> 05:56.279
Shh...

05:56.281 --> 05:58.665
Shh...

06:02.987 --> 06:06.822
Mary, I can't help you.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.593
You have
to take it out.

06:10.595 --> 06:12.328
No, no.
No, you'll die.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.047
Phillip...

06:16.267 --> 06:19.686
It's time.

06:38.956 --> 06:41.074
Thank you.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.695
Thank you.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.331
Oh, Phillip...

06:52.469 --> 06:55.638
Mary...

06:58.225 --> 07:01.965
Noooo!

W. Somerset Maugham.

08:00.454 --> 08:04.806
So, we know this unsub
uses the victims' own cars

08:04.808 --> 08:06.108
as his dumpsite.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.476
Technically,
it's not a dumpsite,

08:07.478 --> 08:09.528
it's a transportation
disposal modality.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.812
The point is,

08:10.814 --> 08:13.148
what does he do once
he abandons the car? Walk?

08:13.150 --> 08:15.183
Well, both cars were found
about 500 feet

08:15.185 --> 08:16.618
from public transportation.

08:16.620 --> 08:20.188
He could catch a bus
or a train, but back to where?

08:20.190 --> 08:22.207
His secondary location
is most likely in Detroit.

08:22.209 --> 08:24.242
Both the couples he kidnapped
are from Grosse Pointe,

08:24.244 --> 08:26.795
which is one of the most
affluent communities in all of America,

08:26.797 --> 08:28.296
and it's only 8 miles
from downtown.

08:28.298 --> 08:30.081
Well, then he's probably
from Grosse Point, too.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.167
To overwhelm two people
at once, he has to blend in.

08:32.169 --> 08:35.386
It feels like the real question is,
why married couples?

08:35.389 --> 08:37.222
If he's a sadist,

08:37.224 --> 08:40.475
having a witness to his torture
heightens his pleasure.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.977
Israel Keyes kidnapped
a husband and wife at gunpoint,

08:42.980 --> 08:44.712
got them in a car,
took them to a remote location,

08:44.714 --> 08:46.214
and then killed the husband
in front of the wife.

08:46.216 --> 08:48.016
Keyes was a sexual
sadist, though.

08:48.018 --> 08:50.235
This guy, I don't know.

08:51.354 --> 08:53.155
Cutting a husband and wife
to death,

08:53.157 --> 08:56.024
it's--it's more like he's mocking
their marriage bond.

08:56.026 --> 08:57.826
That's where my head's at.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.227
They took each other
for better or worse,

08:59.229 --> 09:01.079
now I'm going to
show you worse.

09:01.081 --> 09:03.081
So his home life's
probably a wreck.

09:03.083 --> 09:06.835
At least one ex-wife, not
to mention his mom and dad.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.253
All right, we need to
hit the ground running.

09:08.255 --> 09:09.737
Reid, I want you working
on a geographic profile.

09:09.739 --> 09:11.673
Blake, you and Rossi go to
the morgue, cover victimology.

09:11.675 --> 09:13.708
JJ and Morgan,
go look at the cars.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.093
We need to understand
how he's gaining

09:15.095 --> 09:16.511
control of the victims.

09:16.513 --> 09:18.964
Near as I can tell,
your guy cuts in a mirror pattern.

09:18.966 --> 09:20.265
What he does
to the husband

09:20.267 --> 09:21.633
he matches
with the wife.

09:21.635 --> 09:24.102
Except the wife
had diagonal cuts downward

09:24.104 --> 09:25.604
and the husband's
were horizontal.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.972
In their chest
and torso, yeah.

09:26.974 --> 09:28.440
That gives me a sense of
the attacker's height.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.525
If the attacker's
taller than the victim,

09:30.527 --> 09:32.277
the knife will go down.

09:32.279 --> 09:34.563
But if he's shorter,
it'll go in straight.

09:34.565 --> 09:37.432
So the unsub's taller than the wife
but shorter than the husband.

09:37.434 --> 09:40.118
Wife's 5'4",
husband's 5'8",

09:40.120 --> 09:42.320
so the unsub's about 5'7".

09:42.322 --> 09:43.488
Shrimpy guy.

09:43.490 --> 09:45.740
Wait a minute.
Look at the first couple.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.293
She was 5'11",
he was 6'2".

09:48.295 --> 09:49.961
But the cutting angle
is the same.

09:49.963 --> 09:51.880
Down on her,
straight on him.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.543
Well, it doesn't work
if the unsub's 5'7".

09:54.568 --> 09:56.302
The geometry's off.

09:56.303 --> 09:58.720
I couldn't account for it.
Frankly, I was hoping you could.

09:58.722 --> 10:01.673
Right. Face me.

10:01.675 --> 10:03.642
Put your right hand up.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.061
I'm the wife,
I'm 5'4".

10:06.063 --> 10:07.345
Stab me in the chest.

10:07.347 --> 10:09.064
Bam.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.682
But I do the same
to you.

10:12.318 --> 10:14.486
This is why
he takes couples.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.322
He wants them
to hurt each other.

10:17.324 --> 10:19.822
I posted extra patrols
around the transit stops

10:19.847 --> 10:20.860
like you requested.

10:20.861 --> 10:21.826
Good.

10:21.828 --> 10:23.361
And I gave Dr. Reid
as detailed a map

10:23.363 --> 10:25.480
of Detroit and Grosse Pointe
as I could.

10:25.482 --> 10:28.199
So, he should be all right
there.

10:28.201 --> 10:29.251
Wow.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.335
What'd you find?

10:30.337 --> 10:32.587
Well, date night is very
important to this unsub.

10:32.589 --> 10:33.922
He goes on dates?

10:33.924 --> 10:35.790
No, but his victims do,
and the unsub knows that.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.043
Brian and Melissa Cain
were abducted on a Saturday night.

10:38.045 --> 10:39.544
Their last known
credit card purchase

10:39.546 --> 10:41.379
was at an ice cream shop
they regularly frequent.

10:41.381 --> 10:43.665
Paul and Elizabeth Garrett
had a standing matinee

10:43.667 --> 10:44.558
they went to every Sunday.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.135
They were abducted
in the early evening,

10:46.136 --> 10:47.552
most likely on the way
to their car.

10:47.554 --> 10:48.937
He stalks them
and learns their routines.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.606
Picks couples-oriented
activities as his moment to strike.

10:51.608 --> 10:53.391
Seeing them happy
could enrage him.

10:53.393 --> 10:54.842
It gives him the upper hand.

10:54.844 --> 10:56.678
They're focused on each other. They
don't see him coming.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.514
Ok, then, but how does he
get them both into the car?

10:59.516 --> 11:01.232
Get in the car
or I'll kill your wife.

11:01.234 --> 11:03.401
I could see that once,
but twice?

11:03.403 --> 11:05.353
Well, let's play it out.

11:05.355 --> 11:06.688
All right.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.708
I would sit
in the front seat.

11:09.710 --> 11:14.696
The unsub would
get in the back with the wife.

11:14.698 --> 11:18.199
He'd make the wife
get in first.

11:20.035 --> 11:21.869
It's just awkward.

11:21.871 --> 11:24.005
There's too many
variables.

11:24.007 --> 11:25.674
He could lose control
at any minute.

11:25.676 --> 11:28.009
Somebody fights back or the husband
just waits for the wife to get in

11:28.011 --> 11:29.544
and then locks
the unsub out.

11:29.546 --> 11:32.180
Well, what if he was waiting
inside the car?

11:32.182 --> 11:34.232
It's dark, they're not
paying attention.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.850
He jimmies a door.

11:35.852 --> 11:37.402
But that would leave
a mark.

11:37.404 --> 11:38.853
He didn't
leave any marks.

11:38.855 --> 11:42.390
All right, well, let's
go look at the other car.

11:48.949 --> 11:51.366
Hey, JJ, wait a minute.

11:51.368 --> 11:52.734
What?

11:54.954 --> 11:57.672
The car didn't lock.

11:57.674 --> 11:59.907
It beeped.

11:59.909 --> 12:01.860
Yeah, it beeped...

12:01.862 --> 12:05.130
But it's not making
that locking sound.

12:05.132 --> 12:07.015
He's hacking the cars.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.600
That's how he's getting in.

12:13.222 --> 12:14.472
How we doing, baby girl?

12:14.474 --> 12:17.425
We are doing terrible.
We have another one.

12:17.427 --> 12:20.729
My guys found
the car 90 minutes ago.

12:20.731 --> 12:23.365
Make and model tells me it
doesn't belong in the neighborhood.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.034
What are we, 5 miles
from the last crime scene?

12:26.036 --> 12:27.202
Less.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.670
What do you know
about the victim?

12:28.672 --> 12:31.289
Well, the car is registered
to Dennis Hammond.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.159
This is his wife Mary.

12:34.161 --> 12:36.110
She was dumped alone.
He's off pattern.

12:36.112 --> 12:38.997
What about the husband?
Did the unsub have a shot at him?

12:38.999 --> 12:41.383
Actually, your agents
are talking to him now.

12:42.635 --> 12:44.135
Oh, God.

12:44.137 --> 12:46.054
Uh, Mr. Hammond,
if you want,

12:46.056 --> 12:47.922
we can do this
at the station.

12:47.924 --> 12:49.724
No.

12:49.726 --> 12:52.260
No, what do you
need to know?

12:52.262 --> 12:54.145
Can you explain why
it took you two days

12:54.147 --> 12:56.314
to file a missing persons
report on Mary?

12:56.316 --> 12:58.933
I was traveling.
I didn't know.

12:58.935 --> 13:02.487
You didn't check in
with your wife?

13:02.489 --> 13:03.988
We'd been fighting.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.190
About what?

13:05.192 --> 13:07.358
We have a standing
Thursday night dinner

13:07.360 --> 13:08.810
at our favorite restaurant.

13:08.812 --> 13:11.529
Last Thursday my boss
told me I had to stay

13:11.531 --> 13:14.199
in Cleveland
through the weekend.

13:14.201 --> 13:16.668
But I didn't get around
to telling her that...

13:16.670 --> 13:19.704
till later that night.

13:19.706 --> 13:23.708
When she went to
the restaurant by herself.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.493
Yeah.

13:29.265 --> 13:32.267
So, the victim was supposed
to meet her husband

13:32.269 --> 13:33.551
for date night

13:33.553 --> 13:34.969
and he never showed up.

13:34.971 --> 13:37.856
So the unsub wanted both
but only got one.

13:37.858 --> 13:38.809
He's been patient
and organized up to now.

13:38.834 --> 13:39.925
Why wouldn't he wait?

13:40.527 --> 13:42.176
Maybe one was enough?

13:42.178 --> 13:44.979
No. He gets off
on watching couples.

13:44.981 --> 13:47.615
This unsub wouldn't change
his M.O. without a reason.

13:47.617 --> 13:49.567
We're missing a male victim.

13:55.023 --> 13:58.076
Hi, honey, it's me.
I picked up your prescription

13:58.078 --> 14:02.297
and now I'm on my way home.
I'll see you soon. Mwah.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.105
Aah! Ohh!

14:28.056 --> 14:29.941
Aah! Aah!

14:52.982 --> 14:54.382
Hi.

14:54.384 --> 14:55.550
Hi.

14:55.552 --> 14:57.669
Just calling to check in.

14:57.671 --> 14:59.137
What are you talking about?

14:59.139 --> 15:00.555
You never check in.
You're always too busy

15:00.557 --> 15:02.390
when you're on a case
to do anything.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.725
Well, today I am.

15:03.727 --> 15:06.177
So...

15:06.179 --> 15:08.846
How are you?

15:08.848 --> 15:10.982
I'm fine.

15:12.484 --> 15:15.320
You quit Doctors
Without Borders, didn't you?

15:15.322 --> 15:17.188
Just say it.
I did not.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.523
I did not quit.

15:18.525 --> 15:20.191
Well, then what?

15:20.193 --> 15:22.327
Come on, you're
killing me here.

15:22.329 --> 15:25.496
The worst thing you can do to
a linguist is not communicate.

15:25.498 --> 15:26.480
Alex--

15:26.482 --> 15:27.915
You knew that when
we got engaged.

15:27.917 --> 15:32.153
Alex, they offered me
the position at Harvard.

15:32.155 --> 15:34.539
They did?

15:34.541 --> 15:35.757
Yeah.

15:35.759 --> 15:36.924
Decent hours.

15:36.926 --> 15:38.543
Better pay.

15:38.545 --> 15:40.928
What did you tell them?

15:40.930 --> 15:42.830
I told them that
I would only consider it

15:42.832 --> 15:46.551
if they gave you a position
in the linguistics department,

15:46.553 --> 15:49.854
and they said ok.

15:52.174 --> 15:54.508
They did?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.010
They did.

15:56.012 --> 15:57.562
Now do you understand

15:57.564 --> 15:59.230
why I was waiting
for you to come home

15:59.232 --> 16:02.367
so we could, you know,
celebrate this thing together?

16:02.369 --> 16:03.985
This good thing.

16:03.987 --> 16:06.020
It is.
It's a very good thing.

16:06.022 --> 16:07.872
It's just...

16:07.874 --> 16:10.358
Not what you want.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.460
Not right now.

16:12.462 --> 16:14.379
It's taken me 10 years
to get here.

16:14.381 --> 16:16.530
Not just to get
to the BAU,

16:16.532 --> 16:19.884
but to restore my reputation
inside the Bureau.

16:19.886 --> 16:21.035
I know.

16:21.037 --> 16:26.040
And the job comes first
for both of us.

16:26.042 --> 16:27.875
That was the deal.

16:27.877 --> 16:30.544
Yeah, well, the deal
also came with veto power.

16:30.546 --> 16:33.064
Remember? One of us
could always say,

16:33.066 --> 16:35.650
I want to be a couple again.

16:37.603 --> 16:40.221
Alex...

16:40.223 --> 16:42.223
I want to be a couple again.

16:42.225 --> 16:44.325
Blake.

16:46.612 --> 16:49.197
I gotta go.
Let me think about it.

16:49.199 --> 16:50.865
That means no.

16:50.867 --> 16:54.735
No. No, it means
let me think about it.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.070
Love you.

17:03.079 --> 17:04.929
What do you have?

17:04.931 --> 17:06.681
Grosse Point P.D. got
another missing persons report.

17:06.683 --> 17:07.748
Emma Churchill.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.800
Married?

17:08.801 --> 17:10.300
Her husband
called it in.

17:10.303 --> 17:14.188
Why doesn't this unsub
want men anymore?

17:14.190 --> 17:16.258
The condition of Mary Hammond
is drastically different

17:16.282 --> 17:17.108
than the couples.

17:17.109 --> 17:19.694
Fewer cuts on her, but he held
her for a shorter period of time.

17:19.695 --> 17:21.695
It's not just quantity,
it's quality.

17:21.698 --> 17:22.864
The cuts are more superficial.

17:22.866 --> 17:24.816
Like he's trying
not to hurt her.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.567
Until the one final
stab in the sternum.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.902
She died quickly.

17:27.904 --> 17:30.238
That doesn't make sense.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.940
The unsub doesn't want
to kill her quickly.

17:32.942 --> 17:34.409
He's a sadist.

17:34.411 --> 17:35.543
Why would he do that?

17:35.545 --> 17:36.661
He wouldn't.

17:36.663 --> 17:38.946
But whoever she was
locked up with would.

17:38.948 --> 17:40.581
You think there's
another victim,

17:40.583 --> 17:42.216
one that we didn't
account for?

17:42.218 --> 17:44.135
You asked why this unsub
doesn't want men.

17:44.137 --> 17:46.170
It could because
he still has one.

17:46.172 --> 17:48.423
Based on the ages of the victims,
we believe that the unsub

17:48.425 --> 17:51.058
is a 30- 40-year-old
white male from Grosse Pointe.

17:51.060 --> 17:52.653
Up until now he's been
an equal opportunity,

17:52.678 --> 17:54.596
anger retaliatory sadist.

17:54.597 --> 17:56.589
Which is fancy talk for
he hates the husbands

17:56.614 --> 17:58.183
as much as the wives.

17:58.184 --> 17:59.864
Most likely because
his own marriage failed

17:59.881 --> 18:01.470
in a humiliating way

18:01.471 --> 18:02.854
and his wife left him
for a man

18:02.856 --> 18:04.655
she may be engaged
or even already married to.

18:04.657 --> 18:06.640
But a major shift happened
with Mary Hammond.

18:06.642 --> 18:08.642
He wasn't able
to kidnap the husband,

18:08.644 --> 18:10.495
but he needed
someone to cut her.

18:10.497 --> 18:11.996
So his M.O.
was forced to evolve.

18:11.998 --> 18:15.500
We believe he's abducted
the sixth victim, a man,

18:15.502 --> 18:17.869
probably someone who reminds
him of his own failed marriage.

18:17.871 --> 18:20.788
And he's keeping number 6 alive
so he can repeat the process

18:20.790 --> 18:22.039
with Emma Churchill.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.041
Number 6
could be a surrogate

18:24.043 --> 18:25.376
for the ex-wife's
new husband

18:25.378 --> 18:27.345
or actually be
the new husband.

18:27.347 --> 18:30.014
Which is why the fastest way
to find this unsub

18:30.016 --> 18:32.633
is through this most recent
unknown victim.

18:32.635 --> 18:34.635
We need missing person
reports for all men

18:34.637 --> 18:37.138
in Grosse Pointe and Detroit
as soon as possible.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.607
Even though number 6
was forced to kill Mary Hammond,

18:39.609 --> 18:42.276
he may find it easier to cross
that line with Emma Churchill.

18:53.855 --> 18:56.357
Oh...Oh...

18:59.161 --> 19:00.711
What the hell...

19:03.749 --> 19:04.916
Hey!

19:07.419 --> 19:08.753
Hey!

19:09.972 --> 19:12.089
Hey!

19:21.650 --> 19:24.185
I don't belong in here!

19:24.187 --> 19:27.021
Is there anybody in there?

19:27.023 --> 19:28.523
Hello!

19:28.525 --> 19:29.574
Hello!
Shut up.

19:29.576 --> 19:31.576
Shut up!

19:33.562 --> 19:35.580
Do you want him
to come in here?

19:35.582 --> 19:37.031
Him, who?

19:43.839 --> 19:45.239
Him.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.708
So we didn't see the pattern

19:47.710 --> 19:50.244
until we inspected
Mary Hammond's car.

19:50.246 --> 19:52.213
We know he hacks the remote.
It's not hard.

19:52.215 --> 19:53.714
It runs on a radio frequency.

19:53.716 --> 19:55.103
Pretty easy to jam.

19:55.128 --> 19:57.016
20 bucks at your local
electronics store.

19:57.637 --> 20:00.638
All right, so the victim
thinks she's locked her car.

20:02.141 --> 20:04.609
But she hasn't.

20:04.611 --> 20:07.144
We thought that explained
his entire abduction M.O.,

20:07.146 --> 20:08.529
then Garcia ran a diagnostic

20:08.531 --> 20:10.615
On this car's onboard computer.

20:10.617 --> 20:13.534
Hey, baby girl.
Take it away, mama.

20:13.536 --> 20:15.036
Sir, this guy is creepy clever.

20:15.038 --> 20:17.104
If I may direct
your attention to the GPS.

20:17.106 --> 20:20.908
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now.

20:20.910 --> 20:23.611
All right, the map
seems to be working fine.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.546
When you drive,
the map moves with you.

20:25.548 --> 20:29.634
Let's see what happens
if you look at the driving history.

20:29.636 --> 20:31.088
He covers his tracks,

20:31.113 --> 20:33.114
so we we can't find
a secondary location.

20:33.590 --> 20:34.972
Yeah. Like I said,
creepy clever.

20:34.974 --> 20:36.424
And here is
the diabolical part.

20:36.426 --> 20:38.759
When I checked the software's
internal time stamp

20:38.761 --> 20:41.646
to see when he turned it off,
it's the same on every car--

20:41.648 --> 20:43.314
3 days before date night.

20:43.316 --> 20:44.398
All right,
thanks, Garcia.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.516
Of course, of course.

20:45.518 --> 20:47.234
So he breaks into the car
before the abductions.

20:47.236 --> 20:48.586
Even his stalking's
organized.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.071
But in order
to pull that off,

20:50.073 --> 20:52.573
he needs access to their
cars without attracting attention.

20:52.575 --> 20:55.326
We've already checked
garages and dealerships.

20:55.328 --> 20:57.645
Nothing matched
the service records.

20:57.647 --> 20:58.818
Which means there's
some target-rich location

20:58.843 --> 21:00.165
where all the victims go.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.700
They park, he hacks in.
We just don't know where.

21:02.702 --> 21:04.619
Yes, this is SSA Aaron Hotchner.

21:04.621 --> 21:07.204
I need to speak to the A.G.,
please, as soon as possible.

21:07.206 --> 21:09.874
Yes, sir,
the BAU needs a favor.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.876
And we need it fast.

21:14.996 --> 21:16.130
No.

21:16.132 --> 21:17.932
There's been
some kind of mistake.

21:17.934 --> 21:19.833
I didn't do anything wrong!

21:19.835 --> 21:21.886
You can call my husband.
He's waiting for me.

21:21.888 --> 21:23.771
Did he attack you
in your car?

21:23.773 --> 21:26.807
There was no mistake.

21:26.809 --> 21:29.009
I've been in here
long enough to realize

21:29.011 --> 21:30.611
he doesn't make mistakes.

21:30.613 --> 21:32.563
How long have you
been in here?

21:32.565 --> 21:35.066
Is it still April?

21:37.052 --> 21:38.903
No.

21:38.905 --> 21:40.404
It's May.

21:40.406 --> 21:42.707
May.

21:49.748 --> 21:54.885
He...He gives me clean
clothes and food, but...

21:54.887 --> 21:58.222
There's no schedule to it.
I can't keep track of the days.

21:58.224 --> 22:00.091
Oh, my God.

22:00.093 --> 22:02.560
What's your name?

22:04.396 --> 22:05.763
Emma.

22:05.765 --> 22:08.215
Hi, Emma.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.384
I'm Phillip.

22:12.188 --> 22:13.904
Begin.

22:16.358 --> 22:17.491
What does that mean?

22:17.493 --> 22:19.110
I just want you to know...

22:21.896 --> 22:24.365
I'm really sorry
we have to do this.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.400
Oh, my God.

22:27.419 --> 22:29.070
Agent Hotchner,
what you're asking for

22:29.072 --> 22:30.571
is extremely sensitive.

22:30.573 --> 22:33.407
We're asking for you to cooperate
with a federal investigation.

22:33.409 --> 22:34.908
You're presuming

22:34.910 --> 22:37.911
that the 3 different car companies
represented in this room

22:37.913 --> 22:40.548
track our drivers
via their GPS.

22:40.550 --> 22:42.933
That's
a bold presumption.

22:42.935 --> 22:44.885
Actually, it's not bold,
and we're presuming nothing.

22:44.887 --> 22:47.588
When customers access
their GPS for the first time,

22:47.590 --> 22:49.190
they go to a "terms
and conditions" screen.

22:49.192 --> 22:52.092
They scroll to the bottom,
they click the box that says "agree"

22:52.094 --> 22:53.260
so they can start using it.

22:53.262 --> 22:55.029
They don't realize
they've just agreed

22:55.031 --> 22:56.550
to allowing their car
to communicate its entire

22:56.575 --> 22:58.099
driving history

22:58.100 --> 22:59.817
with your corporate
headquarters.

22:59.819 --> 23:01.368
For research purposes only,
of course.

23:01.370 --> 23:03.708
The only reason these people
agree to share this

23:03.709 --> 23:05.233
information with you
is because they

23:05.234 --> 23:06.939
don't take the time
to read the fine print.

23:07.877 --> 23:09.443
But I do.

23:11.112 --> 23:12.112
Ahem.

23:12.114 --> 23:13.614
We'll, uh--

23:13.616 --> 23:15.382
we'll need to consult
with risk management.

23:15.384 --> 23:16.884
We don't have time for lawyers.

23:16.886 --> 23:20.004
A woman's life is on the line
and we need an answer now.

23:26.178 --> 23:29.013
Aah!

23:29.015 --> 23:32.516
I said, begin.

23:33.769 --> 23:36.103
Emma, I have to come in there.

23:36.105 --> 23:38.155
No.

23:38.157 --> 23:39.156
No!

23:39.158 --> 23:40.691
Get away from me!

23:40.693 --> 23:41.742
Get away!

23:41.744 --> 23:42.693
Then calm down.

23:42.695 --> 23:44.144
Calm down.

23:47.749 --> 23:49.333
It's not your turn.

23:49.335 --> 23:51.502
It's my turn.

23:57.209 --> 23:58.592
Garcia, I don't get it.

23:58.594 --> 24:01.212
Didn't the car companies
give you the same GPS data?

24:01.214 --> 24:03.714
Yes, they did.
But the meta-data

24:03.716 --> 24:05.466
has to be translated
into latitude and longitude,

24:05.468 --> 24:06.647
which is like looking for
a needle in a needlestack

24:06.672 --> 24:08.155
in a field of needles.

24:08.337 --> 24:09.470
Can you match the date?

24:09.472 --> 24:12.673
We know he breaks into
the cars 3 days beforehand.

24:12.675 --> 24:14.537
Well, that would imply
that there is a time stamp

24:14.562 --> 24:15.694
on each of the numbers,

24:15.695 --> 24:17.144
which there is not,
thank you very much.

24:17.146 --> 24:19.029
And forgive my tone,
but I am frustrated!

24:19.031 --> 24:20.180
Wait.

24:20.182 --> 24:22.032
My mood is changing.

24:22.034 --> 24:23.617
We may have a lotto here.

24:23.619 --> 24:25.920
Ding. There is exactly
one point of common intersection

24:25.922 --> 24:27.288
for each of the 4 cars,

24:27.290 --> 24:28.823
and I am sending it
to you now.

24:28.825 --> 24:31.542
Want to take a field trip?

24:31.544 --> 24:34.211
I don't get it.

24:34.213 --> 24:36.831
Why here?

24:36.833 --> 24:38.799
Access, maybe.
He knows the victims

24:38.801 --> 24:42.086
will be away from their cars
while they work out.

24:42.088 --> 24:45.222
Hey, what if it's
a stressor for him?

24:45.224 --> 24:47.091
How so?

24:47.093 --> 24:49.209
Maybe--

24:49.211 --> 24:51.345
maybe she left him
for a guy like that.

24:51.347 --> 24:53.349
He comes here
to blow off steam, sees that,

24:53.374 --> 24:54.399
it only makes him angrier.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.216
When the unsub
takes a closer look,

24:56.218 --> 24:59.353
he sees she's
wearing a ring.

24:59.355 --> 25:01.405
So he follows her
back to her car,

25:01.407 --> 25:03.390
and he's picked
his next victim.

25:03.392 --> 25:06.110
He's gotten to the point where
any husband and wife will do.

25:06.112 --> 25:09.196
That's a lot of anger.

25:09.198 --> 25:10.915
What do you mean,
it's your turn?

25:10.917 --> 25:13.033
I mean, you have--
you have to stab me.

25:13.035 --> 25:15.669
What? I'm not
gonna do that.

25:15.671 --> 25:17.705
Then he'll kill us both.

25:17.707 --> 25:21.742
Now, I'm gonna go sit down
on your cot.

25:24.013 --> 25:26.463
This is some sort of trick.

25:26.465 --> 25:27.748
No.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.466
It's better if I sit.

25:29.468 --> 25:31.685
In case I pass out.

25:37.776 --> 25:40.394
You have until I count to 3.

25:40.396 --> 25:41.896
Ignore him
and do what I say.

25:41.898 --> 25:43.280
1...
Ah--

25:43.282 --> 25:44.782
just do it, right here.
It won't even hurt.

25:44.784 --> 25:45.783
2...

25:45.785 --> 25:47.451
Just do it, ok?
Just right here, Emma.

25:47.453 --> 25:48.786
3.
Oh, God!

25:48.788 --> 25:50.437
Please. Uhh!

25:53.492 --> 25:54.625
There, see? You did it.

25:58.614 --> 25:59.613
Do it again.

25:59.615 --> 26:00.748
What? No!

26:00.750 --> 26:02.633
No!
Again.

26:02.635 --> 26:05.302
No, please.

26:05.304 --> 26:06.804
What's your husband's name?

26:06.806 --> 26:08.806
Let go! Let go!

26:08.808 --> 26:10.341
My wife's name is Maya.

26:10.343 --> 26:14.144
I say her name to remind
myself why I'm still alive.

26:14.146 --> 26:15.128
Stop, please, don't!

26:15.130 --> 26:16.263
What's his name, Emma?

26:16.265 --> 26:18.065
Please, what's his name?

26:18.067 --> 26:19.433
Say his name.

26:19.435 --> 26:21.518
His name is John.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.487
You're doing this for John.

26:23.489 --> 26:25.856
Uhh!
Aah!

26:48.547 --> 26:50.642
All right, so the unsub's using
the track as his hunting ground,

26:50.643 --> 26:52.359
which means he found
number 6 there, too.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.362
And that victim would have pushed
his button in a special way.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.848
You think he could be
one of the trainers?

26:57.850 --> 27:00.985
None of the missing men
are particularly athletic.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.536
So a regular old fitness
buff, then.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.510
Worked out at the track,

27:03.535 --> 27:05.190
just happened to talk
to the wrong unsub.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.575
Well, JJ and I
like Phillip Connor.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.828
This guy.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.163
How come?

27:12.165 --> 27:14.198
Well, for starters, his mother
reported him missing

27:14.200 --> 27:16.083
just after Mary Hammond
disappeared.

27:16.085 --> 27:17.718
And when I spoke to his mom,

27:17.720 --> 27:19.703
she told me that he and
his wife Maya got engaged

27:19.705 --> 27:21.255
while she was still married
to another man.

27:21.257 --> 27:23.207
That would push
the unsub's buttons, all right.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.975
Keep digging into
Phillip Connor.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.728
If he is number 6,
then he'll lead us to the unsub.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.234
I'm gonna need one more.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.903
Oh, yes.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.264
So you and John,

27:47.266 --> 27:49.834
how'd you guys meet?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.401
I'd rather not say.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.670
Yeah.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.923
Might as well.
We're gonna be here a while.

27:55.925 --> 27:59.126
Ok. You first.

27:59.128 --> 28:02.579
When I started dating Maya,

28:02.581 --> 28:05.582
she was already...

28:05.584 --> 28:06.684
You know.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.519
With somebody.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.754
Married to somebody.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.107
Oh.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.037
It was awkward when
he did the whole round

28:15.062 --> 28:16.645
of meet the friends.

28:16.646 --> 28:19.813
They'd ask, so how
did you guys meet?

28:19.815 --> 28:21.732
We'd be like...

28:21.734 --> 28:23.984
Well...

28:23.986 --> 28:26.704
It was a Christian
dating website.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.739
So you met online.
What's the big--

28:28.741 --> 28:31.608
I'm not Christian.
I'm Jewish.

28:31.610 --> 28:32.877
Technically.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.495
Technically.

28:34.497 --> 28:38.332
Genetically. But I've never
set foot in a synagogue.

28:38.334 --> 28:41.252
How'd you break that
to John?

28:41.254 --> 28:43.587
I haven't.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.507
Yet.

28:46.509 --> 28:48.058
Get back in your cell.

28:53.848 --> 28:56.133
Don't. Don't go.

28:56.135 --> 29:00.271
It's ok. We can still
talk through the glass.

29:01.856 --> 29:03.023
Come here.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.578
Listen carefully.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.414
There's a way out of here.

29:19.875 --> 29:22.843
You don't want me to--
No.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.497
You want to talk about
what's bothering you?

29:27.499 --> 29:29.133
No. Nothing's bothering me.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.185
Something's bothering you.
I can always tell when you're bothered

29:31.187 --> 29:33.053
because you whisper lyrics
to yourself.

29:33.055 --> 29:34.939
Hip hop specifically.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.173
I thought it was odd at first,
but then I remembered

29:36.175 --> 29:38.642
your dissertation was on
the fluidity of metaphor.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.611
You seem to have a particular
fondness for nas.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.062
Wow.

29:42.064 --> 29:43.480
How did you know?

29:43.482 --> 29:45.733
Morgan made me listen to him
when we started working together.

29:45.735 --> 29:49.353
He said anybody that can't
quote "illmatic" is ignorant.

29:49.355 --> 29:52.406
So...Do you want to talk
about it?

29:52.408 --> 29:55.859
Oh. The text,
it's from my husband.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.295
Is that a bad thing?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.998
He just wants to know
if I've thought about his offer.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.699
What offer?

30:03.885 --> 30:06.387
To teach with him
at Harvard.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.872
How would you tea--

30:10.091 --> 30:12.042
oh.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.877
Yeah.

30:13.879 --> 30:17.714
Tough call. What do you
think you're gonna do?

30:17.716 --> 30:20.234
When we got married,
part of the attraction

30:20.236 --> 30:22.236
was that we were both
obsessed with our work,

30:22.238 --> 30:24.405
and for a while
that was ok.

30:24.407 --> 30:27.024
Yeah, the last time we talked about it,
you seemed to prefer it.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.226
Oh, not anymore.

30:29.228 --> 30:35.082
I don't like going home
to an empty house.

30:35.084 --> 30:37.117
May I offer some advice?

30:37.119 --> 30:38.568
Sure.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.587
We need to turn around.
You just passed the house.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.922
Oh.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.267
That's not the advice,
though.

30:53.269 --> 30:56.136
Blake, for the last
10 years,

30:56.138 --> 30:58.022
this job has been my life.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.691
And then, for a few months,

31:00.693 --> 31:04.261
I had a taste
of what you have.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.897
So, work...

31:06.899 --> 31:09.233
There's always work,

31:09.235 --> 31:11.902
and there'll always be work.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.938
What's rare is finding someone
who makes us happy.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.944
Yes, my son
went to that track.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.729
Did he ever talk about
who he met there,

31:55.731 --> 31:56.966
maybe someone who took

31:56.991 --> 31:58.939
a particular interest
in him and Maya?

32:03.489 --> 32:05.655
Mrs. Connor?

32:05.657 --> 32:09.009
He didn't go there
to exercise.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.345
He went there
to watch Maya.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.997
Why would he watch
his own wife?

32:16.468 --> 32:17.651
After they married,

32:17.653 --> 32:20.270
Phillip started
to get, uh...

32:20.272 --> 32:22.439
funny.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.508
He kept saying to me,

32:24.510 --> 32:28.779
if she cheated with me,
she'll cheat on me, Mom.

32:28.781 --> 32:30.447
Did she cheat on him?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.515
No.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.984
But she had had enough.

32:33.986 --> 32:37.654
They're not divorced,
but they are separated.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.907
And I can't say
I blame her.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.245
My son is sick.

32:45.247 --> 32:47.831
He enjoys being sick.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.919
It makes people
pay attention to him.

32:51.921 --> 32:54.254
We need to talk to Maya
as soon as possible.

32:54.256 --> 32:56.206
Do you have
her phone number?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.425
Uh...yeah.

32:58.427 --> 33:00.210
I'll go get
my cell phone.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.846
Wait.

33:04.265 --> 33:07.217
Your son's sickness--

33:07.219 --> 33:09.236
does he cut himself?

33:10.555 --> 33:13.240
H-how did you know?

33:17.246 --> 33:18.562
Uhh!

33:26.905 --> 33:28.188
Uhh!

33:28.190 --> 33:30.090
Unh!

33:30.092 --> 33:31.408
Ohh...

34:02.677 --> 34:06.046
Ohh...

34:06.048 --> 34:07.932
Emma.

34:07.934 --> 34:08.933
Help me.

34:10.887 --> 34:13.187
Let me in there.

34:13.188 --> 34:14.188
Let me in!

34:15.190 --> 34:18.275
Oh, God.
What did he do to you?

34:18.277 --> 34:20.610
Punished me
for helping you.

34:20.612 --> 34:22.897
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

34:22.899 --> 34:24.848
It's not your fault.

34:24.850 --> 34:27.902
Ok? It's not--

34:27.904 --> 34:29.235
Cut him.

34:29.237 --> 34:30.571
Leave him alone!

34:30.572 --> 34:34.658
Cut him or I'll kill you.

34:36.962 --> 34:39.696
How can number 6
be the unsub?

34:39.697 --> 34:40.947
We profiled a sadist.

34:40.949 --> 34:43.717
That all changed when
he had Mary Hammond alone.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.170
He found something else
that worked for him.

34:46.172 --> 34:48.554
The guy's wife left him
because he was a cutter.

34:48.556 --> 34:50.056
So he took those women
not because of sex

34:50.059 --> 34:51.592
but because of
something better.

34:51.594 --> 34:54.428
They validate his
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

34:54.429 --> 34:56.230
turn it into a shared
bonding experience.

34:56.232 --> 34:57.848
Then he got to play
two roles--

34:57.850 --> 35:00.384
the unsub who tortures
and the sympathetic prisoner.

35:00.386 --> 35:02.686
So I just spoke with
Phillip's soon-to-be ex-wife.

35:02.688 --> 35:04.888
According to her, he lives
in a day-rate motel.

35:04.890 --> 35:07.157
He'd need more space
and privacy than that.

35:07.159 --> 35:08.525
I'm here, sir.

35:08.527 --> 35:10.744
What do we know about
Phillip Connor's work history?

35:10.746 --> 35:12.813
Uh, he freelanced in the area,
mostly computer stuff,

35:12.815 --> 35:14.898
that the car company
subcontracted out to.

35:14.900 --> 35:18.202
He needs infrastructure.
Something he could convert.

35:18.204 --> 35:22.089
Garcia, what work site
sticks out as the biggest?

35:22.091 --> 35:23.757
There's a microprocessor
plant in foreclosure.

35:23.759 --> 35:25.376
Is that the kind of thing
you're looking for?

35:25.378 --> 35:27.061
The clean rooms.
He could seal his prisoners in there

35:27.063 --> 35:28.578
and no one could
hear them scream.

35:28.580 --> 35:29.797
We're gonna need
a strategy.

35:29.799 --> 35:31.081
If he's got
abandonment issues,

35:31.083 --> 35:32.416
he won't hesitate
to kill Emma.

35:32.418 --> 35:35.085
Unless we give him something
he wants even more.

35:35.087 --> 35:36.437
Can you make that happen?

35:36.439 --> 35:39.974
If I can't, it's gonna be
one hell of a bluff.

35:39.976 --> 35:42.192
And I need your help.

35:42.194 --> 35:43.811
What do we do?

35:43.813 --> 35:45.729
You have to.

35:45.731 --> 35:48.098
You'll die.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.767
We don't have a choice.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.870
No. No, we can fight.

35:52.872 --> 35:54.154
We have a knife.

35:54.156 --> 35:55.656
The woman before you
tried that.

35:55.658 --> 35:58.492
He waited until
we were asleep and then--

35:58.494 --> 35:59.960
Then there has to be
something.

35:59.962 --> 36:01.278
There is.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.113
What?

36:03.115 --> 36:06.250
I've been here so long.

36:06.252 --> 36:08.502
I don't want to live
like this anymore.

36:20.932 --> 36:22.799
Go, go!

36:24.303 --> 36:25.686
Go!

36:25.688 --> 36:27.354
If you don't do it,
he will.

36:27.356 --> 36:29.590
I don't want it to be him.

36:29.592 --> 36:33.160
If you're gone,
what will he do to me?

36:39.984 --> 36:41.835
We could go together.

36:50.879 --> 36:52.513
Clear!

36:57.685 --> 36:59.186
There has to be
another way.

36:59.188 --> 37:00.554
No.

37:00.556 --> 37:01.972
This guy thought
of everything.

37:01.974 --> 37:03.690
It's all we have left.

37:13.785 --> 37:15.852
I could do you first.

37:17.688 --> 37:19.907
I promise,
I'll make it quick.

37:25.463 --> 37:26.863
FBI!

37:26.865 --> 37:28.599
What?
We're coming in!

37:28.601 --> 37:30.918
Oh, my God, it's him, Emma.
Get me up.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.586
No, they said FBI.

37:32.588 --> 37:34.471
Emma!

37:34.473 --> 37:36.140
Oh, my God, they found us!

37:36.142 --> 37:38.892
It's gonna be--

37:38.894 --> 37:41.311
No...

37:41.313 --> 37:42.930
No.

37:42.932 --> 37:43.931
Hit it!

37:43.933 --> 37:45.715
Go, go, go!

37:45.717 --> 37:47.568
Aah!
Aah!

37:47.570 --> 37:49.236
No!

37:51.389 --> 37:54.057
No!
Shoot the glass!

37:58.062 --> 38:00.114
Oh, God.

38:00.116 --> 38:01.949
Oh... oh!

38:03.785 --> 38:05.502
Put down the knife.

38:05.504 --> 38:07.904
Drop your guns,
or I'll gut her.

38:07.906 --> 38:09.406
Oh, God, help me.

38:09.408 --> 38:11.091
Phillip, you don't want
to do this.

38:11.093 --> 38:12.742
You don't know
what I want.

38:12.744 --> 38:14.428
Actually, I do.

38:14.430 --> 38:16.263
You want Maya, right?

38:16.265 --> 38:17.681
You want her back.

38:17.683 --> 38:19.933
I could arrange that.

38:19.935 --> 38:21.268
You're lying.

38:21.270 --> 38:22.752
I'm not.

38:22.754 --> 38:23.937
She'll see you.

38:23.939 --> 38:26.106
But for that to happen,

38:26.108 --> 38:29.476
you have to put down
the knife.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.430
Bring her here.

38:36.117 --> 38:39.119
You--you want her here?

38:39.121 --> 38:41.538
If what you say is true,
I want to see her.

38:41.540 --> 38:45.959
Ok. I'm gonna check.

38:47.112 --> 38:48.712
JJ, you close?

38:48.714 --> 38:50.464
Yeah.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.231
Maya.

39:07.233 --> 39:08.315
Oh, God.

39:08.317 --> 39:11.018
Phillip, what did you do?

39:11.020 --> 39:14.154
Maya, Maya.

39:14.156 --> 39:16.523
You came.

39:16.525 --> 39:20.911
Maya, is there something
you want to say to your husband?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.669
I'm willing to talk.

39:29.987 --> 39:32.873
But only
if you let her go.

39:32.875 --> 39:36.009
Ohh...Oh, God.

39:37.512 --> 39:40.180
Ok.

39:40.182 --> 39:42.266
Ohh!

39:45.721 --> 39:47.688
Don't make me
look at him again!

39:47.690 --> 39:48.722
Wait. No.

39:48.724 --> 39:50.057
Maya.

39:50.059 --> 39:51.308
Wait.

39:51.310 --> 39:52.809
Maya!

39:52.811 --> 39:57.013
Maya! I love you!

40:13.915 --> 40:15.749
There he is.

40:15.751 --> 40:16.967
John.

40:30.715 --> 40:34.985
You've made up your mind,
haven't you?

40:34.987 --> 40:36.937
I'm happy for you.

40:47.198 --> 40:49.416
I'm home.

40:51.953 --> 40:53.920
Honey?

41:11.422 --> 41:13.940
James.

41:13.942 --> 41:15.142
Hey.

41:22.283 --> 41:24.234
Well?

41:24.236 --> 41:26.620
Let's go visit Harvard.

41:26.622 --> 41:30.290
Really?

41:30.292 --> 41:32.993
You're gonna come?

41:32.995 --> 41:34.461
On holidays

41:34.463 --> 41:37.214
and weekends.

41:41.619 --> 41:45.972
Boston's closer
than South Sandistan.

41:45.974 --> 41:50.894
What happened
to our veto power?

41:50.896 --> 41:54.798
I know you want to be
a couple again.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.067
I want that, too.

41:57.069 --> 42:00.020
But...

42:00.022 --> 42:02.305
I need this job.

42:02.307 --> 42:05.776
And one of the things
that made me fall in love with you

42:05.778 --> 42:09.996
is that you understood
that about me.

42:09.998 --> 42:13.784
James, this is the hardest decision
I've ever had to make.

42:13.786 --> 42:15.552
Hey.

42:18.773 --> 42:20.540
Give me your hand.

42:29.467 --> 42:32.886
I took you...

42:32.888 --> 42:36.306
for better or worse...

42:36.308 --> 42:42.312
and nothing is ever
gonna change that.

42:42.314 --> 42:44.114
Right?

42:47.034 --> 42:49.319
Right.
