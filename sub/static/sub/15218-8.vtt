<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

00:05.427 --> 00:08.362
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

00:08.430 --> 00:11.922
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,</i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

00:12.000 --> 00:15.367
<i>To air force test pilot,</i>

00:15.437 --> 00:18.838
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

00:18.907 --> 00:22.741
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

00:22.811 --> 00:27.111
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,</i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

00:27.182 --> 00:30.174
<i>Anyway, here I am,</i>
<i>bouncing around in time,</i>

00:30.252 --> 00:32.186
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

00:32.253 --> 00:36.281
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto,</i>

00:37.359 --> 00:39.759
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

00:39.828 --> 00:41.819
Oh, boy.

<i>If you're going to</i>

01:58.340 --> 02:00.808
<i>you have to be ready</i>
<i>to leap at a moment's notice... </i>

02:02.978 --> 02:05.446
<i>to help your fellow traveler,</i>

02:17.526 --> 02:21.622
<i>And to expect... the unexpected. </i>

02:49.391 --> 02:51.985
<i>Oh, my God, I'm a dork. </i>

02:52.060 --> 02:54.688
<i>A dork with teeth that can</i>
<i>pick up radio transmissions. </i>

02:59.668 --> 03:02.865
Oh, boy.

03:16.251 --> 03:18.185
<i>From his driver's license,</i>
<i>I discovered... </i>

03:18.253 --> 03:20.346
<i>I had leaped into one Cam Wilson,</i>

03:20.422 --> 03:22.982
<i>a 17-year-old hot-rod jockey</i>
<i>who loved junk food... </i>

03:23.058 --> 03:24.992
<i>and had the zits to prove it. </i>

03:25.060 --> 03:27.085
<i>Maybe it had nothing to do</i>
<i>with the kid I replaced,</i>

03:27.162 --> 03:29.653
<i>but I suddenly had this urge</i>
<i>for a burger and malt. </i>

03:36.104 --> 03:40.040
It's the Mom-mobile!

03:40.108 --> 03:42.076
Hey.

03:42.143 --> 03:44.407
Word is you got smeared
at the underpass.

03:44.479 --> 03:46.572
Hey, shame we
weren't racing for pinks.

03:46.648 --> 03:50.812
I could've wiped this eyesore
off the boulevard. Oh, yeah!

03:50.886 --> 03:53.013
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Bobby!

03:53.088 --> 03:56.216
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Bob-a-rino!

03:56.291 --> 04:00.250
Bobby.
Bobby!

04:00.328 --> 04:04.526
Hey, hey!
Hey, watch the car!

04:04.599 --> 04:07.363
Cam, come here.

04:20.248 --> 04:22.375
We got accepted to the Peace Corps!
Isn't that fantastic?

04:22.450 --> 04:26.716
That's... That's, uh, great, Cheryl.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.256
I can't believe we are going.
We are actually going.

04:29.324 --> 04:30.814
Great.

04:30.892 --> 04:32.917
Promise not to tell Mom
and Dad until I do, okay?

04:32.994 --> 04:35.189
- You got it.
- That's right.

04:35.263 --> 04:39.791
We are going to the middle of the
South Pacific to an island called Tonga.

04:39.868 --> 04:41.802
I'm gonna help set up
a food cooperative,

04:41.870 --> 04:44.202
and Bob is gonna teach
the natives new ways to fish.

04:44.272 --> 04:46.206
Right. I'm bringing the beer.

04:46.274 --> 04:49.539
Hey, hey!

04:49.611 --> 04:53.206
Get a room. Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

04:53.281 --> 04:56.842
Oh, Bobby!

04:56.918 --> 04:58.943
We're gonna go right after
the honeymoon.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.147
First we're gonna take
a train up to San Francisco,

05:01.222 --> 05:03.588
and then we're gonna take
a Peace Corps plane to Hawaii.

05:03.658 --> 05:06.252
We've got to spend a month
at this training center on Oahu...

05:06.328 --> 05:09.478
learning about the languages and
the customs on the Tonga Islands

05:09.479 --> 05:10.958
before we can actually go there.

05:11.032 --> 05:14.399
- Sounds great.
- Here's to Tonga.

05:15.403 --> 05:17.769
- Hey!
- Boys aren't supposed to carry purses.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.899
- Give it back!
- You guys, leave Jill alone!

05:20.976 --> 05:23.103
Come on. Give me it!

05:23.178 --> 05:26.636
- Come on, you guys. That's not nice!
- Give it back to me!

05:26.715 --> 05:28.706
Just stop it!

05:38.259 --> 05:41.057
When are you guys
gonna grow up, huh?

05:41.129 --> 05:43.757
Instead of acting like
a bunch of JD's?

05:43.832 --> 05:46.027
Ooh!

06:01.049 --> 06:03.279
I'm sorry.

06:03.351 --> 06:06.445
Just... They're always
chopping me down.

06:08.523 --> 06:10.650
They're just insecure.

06:10.725 --> 06:15.685
Repressing their sensitivities
and projecting their unconscious fears.

06:16.698 --> 06:19.030
Really?

06:19.100 --> 06:21.193
How do you know all that?

06:21.269 --> 06:24.295
I took Psych 1.

06:24.372 --> 06:27.170
Wow.
Don't you worry about it.

06:27.242 --> 06:30.973
When you get a little bit older, the
Impalas would die to go out with you.

06:31.980 --> 06:35.279
I wouldn't date
any of those weenies.

06:36.851 --> 06:39.376
But I might go out with your brother. Cam?

06:39.454 --> 06:42.651
Yes. He's pretty tough.

06:42.724 --> 06:44.851
You can't pants
a guy with glasses.

06:44.926 --> 06:48.293
He's right. Stop!

06:48.363 --> 06:50.194
What glasses?
Hey!

06:50.265 --> 06:52.495
He's not wearing any underwear.

06:55.737 --> 06:57.671
Up. Go on, go on.

06:57.739 --> 07:01.766
- Come on, Bob.
- No way. I'm not catching hell from Cheryl.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.606
Let's go. To the Dumpster. To the Dumpster.

07:06.781 --> 07:09.079
Get his shirt off.
His shirt's off. Okay.

07:09.150 --> 07:10.947
Okay. On three.

07:11.019 --> 07:14.352
One, two, three!

07:17.292 --> 07:19.123
Two points.
Let's go.

07:19.194 --> 07:21.128
Let's go!
Oh, yeah!

07:24.766 --> 07:29.601
Nice dive, Sam.
See, I gave you a 9.5 on that dive.

07:31.539 --> 07:36.442
I would've given you a 10, uh, except I got a
little Russian blood in me on my mother's side.

07:39.347 --> 07:41.577
Let's go!

07:41.649 --> 07:44.709
Do you want me to tell Cam?
No, don't you dare say a word.

07:44.786 --> 07:47.721
All right! I'm coming!

07:47.789 --> 07:50.257
Maybe just a hint, okay?
No, Cheryl, don't, please.

07:50.325 --> 07:52.384
I'll be so embarrassed.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.792
See you later.

07:54.863 --> 07:58.458
You remind me of a stripper
I know in Vegas.

07:58.533 --> 08:01.900
She starts out with
an empty TV shipping carton,

08:01.970 --> 08:05.428
and then she ends up with a little
teeny-weeny Kleenex box right over...

08:05.507 --> 08:08.943
Al. Look, I... I could
use a little help here.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.570
What help? I can't help.
I'm a hologram.

08:17.318 --> 08:19.115
Cam?

08:24.192 --> 08:27.457
- Are you naked?
- Do the initials B.A. Mean anything to you?

08:27.529 --> 08:28.996
Sort of.

08:29.063 --> 08:31.793
The Impalas are such juveniles.

08:31.866 --> 08:34.801
You know, all they're doing
is repressing their sensitivities...

08:34.869 --> 08:37.633
and projecting their unconscious fears.

08:37.705 --> 08:40.606
- Where are your glasses?
- They're around here.

08:40.674 --> 08:42.370
They're around here somewhere.

08:44.179 --> 08:47.012
Cam, did you get
pantsed because of me?

08:49.384 --> 08:51.318
Oh, Cam!

08:51.386 --> 08:54.116
Uh, excuse me, uh...

08:59.894 --> 09:02.124
Ah, young love.
There's nothing like it.

09:02.197 --> 09:04.222
How would you know?

09:12.707 --> 09:14.834
What's this?
Your usual, silly.

09:14.909 --> 09:18.970
Two Pinky burgers, a large order of fries,
a chocolate shake and a cherry Coke.

09:19.047 --> 09:20.981
When you're finished,
I'll be back with your dessert.

09:22.917 --> 09:27.047
Just put a cherry on top of your head. Al.

09:27.121 --> 09:29.919
Al? What year is this?

09:29.991 --> 09:32.687
1961.
Great.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.820
The tail end of the most
immature period in history.

09:35.897 --> 09:37.831
All the guys still drink malts,

09:37.899 --> 09:40.424
drive hot rods and wear
butch wax in their hair.

09:40.501 --> 09:43.959
And the girls all have pillow fights,

09:44.038 --> 09:47.439
chat on the phone, blind dates
and get their panties raided.

09:47.508 --> 09:50.375
Ah, those were the good old days.

09:50.445 --> 09:52.572
Ooh, man, that looks good!

09:52.647 --> 09:55.115
Want a bite?

09:55.183 --> 09:57.549
Oh, sorry.
You're a hologram.

09:59.854 --> 10:03.221
Oh, look at this mint '60 Corvette.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.418
Did you ever notice that
girls never cuddle up to guys...

10:05.493 --> 10:07.427
unless they're driving a fancy car?

10:07.495 --> 10:12.455
I mean, you've never seen a woman throw
herself at a guy in a Rambler. Never!

10:12.533 --> 10:14.592
You gonna let a car like that
rule your life?

10:14.669 --> 10:16.830
Yes.

10:18.439 --> 10:21.875
You know, maybe I'm here
to clear up this kid's complexion.

10:21.943 --> 10:25.572
Looks like he's gonna die of terminal
acne. You're not here for Cam.

10:25.647 --> 10:29.378
According to Ziggy,
there's an 82.6% chance...

10:29.450 --> 10:32.442
you're here to keep Cheryl
from marrying Bob.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.547
- But they look like the perfect couple.
- Yeah, but Ken and Barbie grow up.

10:36.624 --> 10:39.422
Bob ends up selling
used cars for his father...

10:39.494 --> 10:42.292
and getting arrested a lot of times
for drunken driving.

10:42.363 --> 10:43.086
Cheryl?

10:43.087 --> 10:46.060
She never made it to the Peace
Corps and never saw much of the world.

10:46.134 --> 10:48.602
Ziggy's gotta be wrong.
She's bright and alive.

10:48.670 --> 10:52.071
I can't see anything stopping
her. Evidently, Bob did.

10:52.140 --> 10:54.665
He also appears
to have been a mean drunk.

10:54.742 --> 10:56.733
He didn't hit her?

10:56.811 --> 10:58.904
Well, let's just say she had...

10:58.980 --> 11:01.448
more than her share of accidental falls.

11:13.161 --> 11:15.857
What's the matter?

11:15.930 --> 11:19.764
The first time my sister got married,
she was 17.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.466
Guess she wanted to
get away from the farm.

11:25.306 --> 11:29.106
He drank a lot,
and when he got drunk...

11:30.545 --> 11:32.172
I'm sorry, Sam.

11:32.246 --> 11:35.181
She was too afraid to leave,

11:36.217 --> 11:38.447
too ashamed to tell anyone.

11:39.887 --> 11:43.050
She was my sister... She is
my sister. I should've known.

11:43.124 --> 11:46.355
Maybe I could've helped her.
Maybe I could've...

11:46.427 --> 11:48.361
saved her from a lot of pain.

11:48.429 --> 11:51.125
Yeah, but it...
it wasn't your fault.

11:53.835 --> 11:55.826
Maybe not.

11:57.071 --> 12:01.872
But if I can't stop Cheryl
from marrying Bob, it will be.

12:11.285 --> 12:14.777
<i>Why don't you tip a guy off when</i>
<i>your old man is pussy footing around?</i>

12:14.856 --> 12:18.155
<i>Why'd you wanna come over
here for? What's up, Eddie?</i>

12:18.226 --> 12:20.888
<i>Nothing. </i>

12:22.263 --> 12:26.029
<i>I guess you haven't heard</i>
<i>about me going steady, huh?</i>

12:27.869 --> 12:32.465
<i>You're going steady?</i>
<i>Sure. It's all over school. </i>

12:32.540 --> 12:35.805
<i> Hey. </i>
<i>You going steady with a girl, Eddie?</i>

12:35.877 --> 12:39.040
<i>Sure. Carolyn Schuster. </i>

12:41.149 --> 12:44.676
<i>Carolyn Schuster?
Man, she's kind of pretty. </i>

12:44.752 --> 12:48.984
<i>Well, sure she's pretty. </i>
<i>I ain't going steady with no owls. </i>

12:49.057 --> 12:52.220
<i>What are you laughing at?</i>

12:52.293 --> 12:54.557
<i>Oh, uh, nothing, Eddie. </i>
<i>Nothing at all. </i>

12:54.629 --> 12:57.792
<i>- Uh, I just thought
something seemed funny. </i>

12:57.865 --> 13:01.062
Hey, kiddo.
Hiya, Dad.

13:01.135 --> 13:03.103
Hey, what's wrong?
You can't take a punch anymore?

13:04.539 --> 13:08.031
No, no, I just, uh...
I hurt this arm.

13:08.109 --> 13:11.704
Oh, sorry, kid. Got ya! It's all...

13:11.779 --> 13:14.714
Put the gloves on. Go out in
the backyard, huh? Dad. Dad.

13:14.782 --> 13:17.250
That's okay. Dad, that's all right.
I'll just go into my room...

13:17.318 --> 13:19.377
and just slam my head into the wall.

13:19.454 --> 13:22.184
That's my boy.

13:22.256 --> 13:24.622
Oh!

13:24.692 --> 13:26.853
Your Mom's lookin' for you.

13:26.928 --> 13:29.260
She's on the warpath.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.894
That's my boy.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.806
<i>It's too early in the morning
to go look at girls. </i>

13:46.047 --> 13:49.778
Cameron!

13:51.953 --> 13:56.253
Yeah?
I want to see you...

13:57.658 --> 14:01.025
I- gotta change...
Now!

14:08.836 --> 14:11.134
Uh, M-Mom?

14:21.082 --> 14:23.915
Excuse me.

14:23.985 --> 14:26.886
What is this?

14:28.589 --> 14:30.784
- An old Playboy magazine.
- Old?

14:30.858 --> 14:34.487
Miss May looks
pretty fresh to me.

14:34.562 --> 14:36.689
Rosa found that wedged
behind your hamper.

14:36.764 --> 14:37.767
She had a conniption fit.

14:37.768 --> 14:39.892
She started crossing herself
and yammering in Spanish.

14:39.967 --> 14:42.197
She sounded worse than
Scooter choking on a fur ball.

14:42.270 --> 14:45.637
- Sorry.
- That's four cleaning ladies since October.

14:45.706 --> 14:49.214
This one quits, mister, and
you're grounded for a year!

14:49.315 --> 14:50.643
Okay.

14:50.711 --> 14:54.704
- Where are you going?
- To my, uh, room?

14:54.782 --> 14:58.309
- Well?
- Well, what?

14:58.386 --> 15:01.913
- Where's my kiss?
- Oh, yeah.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.364
Oh, you little sweet...

15:11.432 --> 15:13.559
Oh, Cameron!

15:25.246 --> 15:26.770
Oh, Cam!

15:26.847 --> 15:29.873
Honey, your sister needs your help
with some errands tomorrow.

15:29.951 --> 15:33.182
Would you stop by after
the bridal shower, about 3:00?

15:33.254 --> 15:35.654
Okay, Mom.

15:35.723 --> 15:37.384
Mom.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.393
Is that Tab Hunter
sneaking at my door there?

15:40.461 --> 15:44.363
Get in here, you little heartbreaker.

15:44.432 --> 15:48.368
Sit down.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.803
I know who's got a crush on you.

15:54.308 --> 15:56.606
- Who?
- Jill.

15:56.677 --> 15:59.976
Jill? Jill?

16:00.047 --> 16:02.914
Oh, right. Last week you were
getting up the guts to ask her out,

16:02.984 --> 16:05.214
and now you hardly
know her, huh?

16:06.387 --> 16:09.049
Are you gonna bring her to the wedding?
I don't know. She's awful young.

16:10.258 --> 16:12.749
Okay, what are you now, Mr. Mature?

16:12.827 --> 16:14.761
She's only a year behind you.

16:14.829 --> 16:17.457
What happened
to your shirt there?

16:17.531 --> 16:19.522
Oh, that's...

16:26.107 --> 16:28.166
This is great. If you had
worked on the campaign...

16:28.242 --> 16:31.871
instead of the Nomad,
you could have met him too, you know.

16:31.946 --> 16:33.937
Don't break it.

16:38.819 --> 16:43.313
Remember that time you were leaping
around in that silly Zorro outfit of yours,

16:43.391 --> 16:45.586
and you broke my
"Love Me Tender" record?

16:45.660 --> 16:48.493
Well, that's what you get
for leaving it on the floor.

16:48.562 --> 16:51.360
It was on my hope chest, Cam.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.924
I'd let my fingernails
grow real long,

16:55.002 --> 16:59.063
and I grabbed for you, and I
accidentally scratched your face.

16:59.140 --> 17:01.768
Uh, yeah, mm-hmm. And then
you went straight to Mom.

17:01.842 --> 17:05.835
At last you had visible evidence
of how I abused you.

17:05.913 --> 17:08.143
I was so proud of those nails too.

17:08.214 --> 17:12.049
Then Mom cut 'em all off.
Remember? I wanted to kill you.

17:12.118 --> 17:16.714
Well, I'm glad you didn't.
Me too.

17:22.363 --> 17:24.523
Strange,

17:24.598 --> 17:28.227
now that I'll finally be doing
what I've always dreamed of...

17:28.301 --> 17:30.964
It's a little scary.
How did you know?

17:31.038 --> 17:33.734
Oh, I've had the feeling.

17:33.808 --> 17:35.867
You're gonna do great.
You really think so?

17:35.943 --> 17:39.743
I guarantee it.
Oh, what do you know?

17:39.814 --> 17:43.511
Furthest you've ever been away
from home is the Pomona Hospital.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.245
Oh, God!

17:45.319 --> 17:49.517
Whoa. Thanks.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.581
Oh, I'm so jittery lately.

17:52.660 --> 17:55.060
Well, you know, uh,
leaving home, getting married.

17:55.129 --> 17:58.826
You got a lot to be jittery about.
Yeah.

17:58.899 --> 18:00.924
Maybe you ought a...

18:01.001 --> 18:04.129
take it, you know,
one step at a time.

18:04.205 --> 18:06.435
Wait to get married
until after the Peace Corps.

18:06.507 --> 18:10.500
You know I can't. Bob won't
go unless we get married first.

18:10.578 --> 18:12.808
Why?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.508
He just won't.
I don't know.

18:16.550 --> 18:18.745
Well, maybe he's not
the guy for you then.

18:20.521 --> 18:23.285
What's wrong with Bob? For
starters, he drinks too much.

18:23.357 --> 18:25.552
Cam, he's just celebrating
our wedding...

18:25.626 --> 18:27.617
and graduating
and everything, that's all.

18:27.695 --> 18:29.629
What if he never
stops celebrating?

18:29.697 --> 18:31.494
He won't have
much a choice, will he?

18:31.565 --> 18:33.863
There's not a whole lot
of liquor stores in Tonga.

18:33.934 --> 18:36.698
If he goes to Tonga.
What do you mean by that?

18:39.006 --> 18:41.668
Just a hunch.
I don't believe you.

18:41.742 --> 18:45.269
One minute you think Bob is the greatest,
and the next, you're tearing him down.

18:45.346 --> 18:47.405
Look, I just want
what's best for you.

18:47.481 --> 18:49.472
It's too late for that, isn't it?

18:49.550 --> 18:51.984
I'm getting married in three days.

19:07.468 --> 19:10.699
<i>Sometimes my Swiss cheese
memory plays funny tricks on me. </i>

19:10.771 --> 19:13.934
<i>I knew from the sound of the engine</i>
<i>that the cam shaft had a flat lobe,</i>

19:14.008 --> 19:16.184
<i>but I didn't have the
vaguest idea of where</i>

19:16.185 --> 19:18.104
<i>the cam shaft was or how to remove it. </i>

19:18.179 --> 19:20.286
<i>I felt like a newborn calf
walking around its mother,</i>

19:20.287 --> 19:21.979
<i>knowing there was milk
there... somewhere. </i>

19:22.049 --> 19:24.074
I can't set the timing.

19:24.151 --> 19:26.278
That's because there's
a flat lobe on the cam shaft.

19:26.353 --> 19:28.685
The same problem we had
with that Olds last week.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.657
Yeah, yeah, that old Olds.

19:34.261 --> 19:37.753
Well, guess I'm gonna have to
pull the cam shaft.

19:37.832 --> 19:39.959
You... You probably forgot.

19:40.034 --> 19:42.502
I did not.

19:42.570 --> 19:45.334
It's okay if you forgot. It's no... No, I didn't.

19:46.907 --> 19:48.498
Show me.

19:59.253 --> 20:02.780
Oh, Tina would look
good without that on.

20:02.857 --> 20:05.087
Al.

20:05.159 --> 20:08.185
Hi, Sam.
Oh, you've missed all the fun.

20:08.262 --> 20:11.527
Check out this black number
in the Frederick's of Hollywood box.

20:11.599 --> 20:14.568
I will not check that out.
What are you doing here?

20:14.635 --> 20:19.800
I'm confirming that Ziggy's data
retrieval circuits are fully functional.

20:19.874 --> 20:21.671
- What?
- You see,

20:21.742 --> 20:24.006
he predicted that Cheryl's
lingerie party...

20:24.078 --> 20:26.740
would start precisely at 2:07...

20:26.814 --> 20:28.748
Pacific Daylight Time.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.750
He was eight seconds off.

20:30.818 --> 20:33.514
Al, you didn't stand in here...

20:33.587 --> 20:36.920
and watch Cheryl trying
all this stuff on?

20:36.991 --> 20:39.016
Well, you know, uh...

20:39.093 --> 20:41.755
If you're gonna publish,
you gotta have data.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.997
What are you gonna publish,
a lingerie catalogue?

20:45.065 --> 20:46.999
That's a good idea, Sam.

20:47.067 --> 20:50.059
I could do some inside research,
if you get my drift.

20:50.137 --> 20:53.072
Yeah, I get your drift.
Wha-What else are you here for?

20:53.140 --> 20:55.768
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

20:55.843 --> 20:57.777
Nothing, no.

20:57.845 --> 21:01.713
I thought lingerie was enough.

21:10.124 --> 21:11.365
How many times have I told you

21:11.366 --> 21:14.220
not to come in through the living
room with that grease all over you?

21:14.295 --> 21:17.492
207.
That is not funny.

21:17.565 --> 21:20.966
Sorry. Um, Mom, where's Cheryl?

21:23.270 --> 21:27.400
Trying on Mrs. Thompson's
wedding dress.

21:33.614 --> 21:35.548
Mom? Where's Mom?

21:35.616 --> 21:37.641
Mom!

21:37.718 --> 21:39.652
...Mom!

21:39.720 --> 21:41.745
Mom!

21:49.296 --> 21:51.287
What's going on?

21:54.435 --> 21:57.097
Mom wanted me to wear
her wedding dress.

21:58.305 --> 22:02.036
Bob made such a... big deal
out of my wearing his mother's.

22:02.109 --> 22:04.202
I mean, what was I gonna say?

22:04.278 --> 22:06.212
Whose do you want to wear?

22:06.280 --> 22:08.908
I don't know, and I don't care.

22:08.983 --> 22:11.918
Everybody's just driving me crazy
with what I should do.

22:11.986 --> 22:14.955
I just can't wait to get
this thing over with.

22:15.022 --> 22:18.219
- You want some help?
- I can do it!

22:21.261 --> 22:23.252
Damn it!

22:25.032 --> 22:27.023
Now can I help?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.144
How'd you get these bruises
on your neck?

22:44.385 --> 22:46.319
I fell.

22:47.388 --> 22:49.822
Did Bob do it?
Don't be silly.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.824
He did, didn't he?
No, he didn't.

22:51.892 --> 22:55.020
Don't lie for him!
Drop it, Cam.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.458
I can't. You're my sister.

23:04.571 --> 23:07.039
Man, you look gorgeous.

23:11.745 --> 23:14.737
It's bad luck to see me
in my wedding dress.

23:19.153 --> 23:21.144
Hey, buddy.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.559
What the hell is this?

23:26.627 --> 23:29.391
You trying to make up for the bruise?

23:33.600 --> 23:37.434
What are you talking about?
The bruise on Cheryl's neck.

23:37.504 --> 23:41.941
You know, it's... it's the kind you get
when you grab somebody's neck like this.

23:56.657 --> 23:58.784
Tell Cheryl I'll
pick her up at 6:00.

24:04.998 --> 24:06.989
For the rehearsal.

24:18.312 --> 24:22.476
And by the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

24:22.549 --> 24:24.540
Now you may kiss the bride.

24:32.893 --> 24:35.169
Then you'll both walk down the
aisle and begin a wonderful life...

24:35.170 --> 24:35.623
Yeah.

24:35.696 --> 24:37.789
Full of joy and happiness.

24:37.865 --> 24:41.562
I hope you haven't started yet.
Hey, Bill. Mrs. Bill.

24:41.635 --> 24:45.571
- Where the hell have you been?
- Wheeling and dealing to pay for this party.

24:45.639 --> 24:48.073
You're not gonna know
what to do the day of the wedding.

24:48.142 --> 24:50.372
Sure I am. Drink heavily.

24:52.179 --> 24:56.240
Hey, sorry, kid.
Had to close a deal.

24:56.316 --> 24:58.876
Sold two units new,
one used.

24:58.952 --> 25:01.682
Great! That's great!

25:01.755 --> 25:05.247
My God, look at this
pretty little thing.

25:06.727 --> 25:10.163
Boy, if Bob didn't see you first,
I'd sweep you up myself.

25:10.230 --> 25:12.562
Let's eat.

25:17.638 --> 25:21.972
I'm sorry, dear. He just started
celebrating a little early.

25:26.446 --> 25:28.437
Like father, like s...

25:30.617 --> 25:33.313
Do me a favor and punch me
somewhere else, okay?

25:33.387 --> 25:35.878
Oh. Okay.

25:40.093 --> 25:43.290
And she said,
"Of course you can.

25:43.363 --> 25:45.627
That's where lawyers come from".

25:49.937 --> 25:54.897
<i>Leaping about in time, I've suffered</i>
<i>some humiliation and abuse. </i>

25:54.975 --> 25:57.000
<i>But I can't recall</i>
<i>anything as horrible... </i>

25:57.077 --> 25:59.739
<i>as being forced to sit</i>
<i>at the children's table. </i>

26:13.260 --> 26:16.889
All right. All right, everybody.

26:16.964 --> 26:19.865
Listen up. First of all,

26:19.933 --> 26:21.901
I'd like to thank...

26:21.969 --> 26:24.870
the most important person here.

26:26.173 --> 26:28.164
The wine waiter.

26:34.815 --> 26:38.080
No, but seriously,

26:38.151 --> 26:40.551
we're all here on this
very special occasion...

26:41.555 --> 26:45.116
the marriage of my firstborn, Bob,

26:45.192 --> 26:47.592
and his lovely bride, Cheryl.

26:49.963 --> 26:53.399
So I'd like you all
to raise your glasses...

26:53.467 --> 26:55.401
and join me in a toast...

26:55.469 --> 26:58.905
to these two wonderful, wonderful...

26:58.972 --> 27:01.600
wonderful kids.

27:01.675 --> 27:03.575
May you have all the best.

27:13.353 --> 27:15.913
Bobby!

27:15.989 --> 27:18.651
Speaking for Cheryl and myself,

27:18.725 --> 27:20.920
no one knows what
the future will bring us,

27:20.994 --> 27:25.055
but I'm sure it's going to be filled
with lots of joy and happiness.

27:25.132 --> 27:28.397
- Here's to my lovely bride.
- Yeah.

27:28.468 --> 27:32.302
- May our love live forever and ever.
- Here, here.

27:38.845 --> 27:42.872
Yeah, Bobby!

27:48.855 --> 27:53.155
And now, I would like to present
my wedding gift to Cheryl.

27:53.226 --> 27:57.196
- What is it?
- Open it.

28:05.839 --> 28:08.672
Oh, my God!

28:08.742 --> 28:10.767
It's a color TV.

28:19.453 --> 28:21.284
I'd like to make a toast.

28:25.359 --> 28:27.657
<i>The Mom-mobile's
gonna make a speech!</i>

28:32.632 --> 28:34.725
I'd like to make a toast.

28:34.801 --> 28:38.168
First, to my sister, Cheryl,

28:39.239 --> 28:42.402
I just want you to know how proud
I am to have you as my big sister.

28:44.378 --> 28:47.779
You're a person with
incredible strength and vision.

28:47.848 --> 28:51.944
A person brave enough to answer
President Kennedy's call to...

28:52.019 --> 28:54.044
"ask not what your country
can do for you,

28:54.121 --> 28:56.419
but what you can do
for your country. "

28:58.025 --> 29:01.722
I'm so proud of you for having
the courage to go out...

29:01.795 --> 29:06.061
and make a difference in the lives
of people less fortunate than ourselves.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.667
So, hum...

29:13.640 --> 29:16.200
I'd also like to
make a toast to Bob.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.710
I understand there's no electricity
on the island of Tonga and...

29:18.779 --> 29:23.239
Well, thanks to your gift,
I'll be watching Bonanza in color.

29:27.921 --> 29:30.685
That was an impressive
little speech, Sam.

29:30.757 --> 29:32.987
I'm touched.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.223
Al, I gotta find a way
to get her out of this wedding.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.821
Hey, hey, hey, hey, check it out.
Hey.

29:38.899 --> 29:42.096
Camikazi's lost it, man.
He's talking to himself.

29:42.169 --> 29:44.330
Watch this.

29:44.404 --> 29:46.770
- Oh, man.
- She won't listen to me.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.308
I mean, she thinks of me
as her dorky little bro...

29:55.515 --> 29:59.007
Food fight! Food fight!
I like food fights.

30:00.220 --> 30:02.780
Well, some of the time,
not all of the time.

30:05.225 --> 30:09.093
I think we should, uh,
go to the restroom.

30:09.162 --> 30:11.562
But I don't have to go.

30:16.636 --> 30:19.969
That was good.
It came down to the fact...

30:21.041 --> 30:23.635
It started already, Al.

30:23.710 --> 30:27.942
I found a bruise on Cheryl's neck, and when
I asked her about it, she said she fell.

30:28.014 --> 30:31.677
I could never understand why women
cover up for monsters like that.

30:31.751 --> 30:33.981
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

30:35.755 --> 30:40.454
I asked her to delay the wedding
until after the Peace Corps, but...

30:40.527 --> 30:42.518
No go, huh?

30:45.065 --> 30:47.533
Would you listen to me?

30:47.601 --> 30:49.330
I see your point.

30:51.705 --> 30:55.106
Hey, mister, who you talking to?

30:58.245 --> 31:00.179
Uh,

31:00.247 --> 31:02.112
I, uh... I was just...

31:02.182 --> 31:05.515
I'm an actor, and I was just
kind of, you know, doing a scene.

31:11.925 --> 31:14.450

31:14.528 --> 31:16.519

31:34.147 --> 31:36.377
<i>Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee</i>
<i>I say rock</i>

31:36.449 --> 31:38.815
<i>Every little swallow</i>
<i>Every chickadee</i>

31:38.885 --> 31:41.979
<i>Every little bird</i>
<i>in the tall oak tree</i>

31:42.055 --> 31:45.149
<i>The wise old owl</i>
<i>The big black crow</i>

31:45.225 --> 31:47.489
<i>Flap their wings</i>
<i>singing go, bird, go</i>

31:47.561 --> 31:48.599
<i>Rocking robin</i>

31:48.600 --> 31:51.657
<i>Rock, rock, rocking robin</i>
<i>Tweet, tweet, tweet</i>

31:51.731 --> 31:53.892
<i>Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee</i>
<i>Go rocking robin</i>

31:53.967 --> 31:56.663
Come on, Mikey. We gotta rehearse. Bye-bye.

32:00.874 --> 32:03.434
- Nah.
- Hey, is that that new dance?

32:04.511 --> 32:07.207
No, Dad.
The twist goes like this.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.306
Hey, now, I can still
dance you off the floor.

32:10.383 --> 32:12.408
Hey, Dad, take it easy.
Whoa.

32:12.485 --> 32:17.047
You're not as young as you
used to be. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

32:17.123 --> 32:21.025
You're right about that. That's
why I took you for a partner, right?

32:22.095 --> 32:24.029
Why, that dirty crumb!
Shh, shh, shh.

32:24.097 --> 32:26.122
What "shh"?
They can't hear me.

32:26.199 --> 32:28.929
Al, but...
They can't see me.

32:29.002 --> 32:31.493
When are you gonna tell her?
After the honeymoon.

32:31.571 --> 32:35.098
What about tonight?
I'm taking you into the business.

32:35.175 --> 32:39.578
I'm buying you a house for a
wedding gift, and nobody knows it.

32:39.646 --> 32:41.841
That ain't fair, son.
Dad, I understand.

32:41.915 --> 32:45.476
But Cheryl's gonna go nuts when I tell
her we're not joining the Peace Corps.

32:45.552 --> 32:49.545
Son, she's 22 years old.

32:49.623 --> 32:51.557
She'll own her own house.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.355
She's got a husband
who's a used car manager.

32:54.427 --> 32:58.488
- What girl wouldn't go nuts?
- Dad she's hot about this Peace Corps thing.

32:58.565 --> 33:00.499
- What about you?
- Me?

33:00.567 --> 33:03.559
Teaching a bunch of headhunters
how to fly-fish? No way.

33:03.637 --> 33:06.299
You know, your mother
wanted to go to college.

33:06.373 --> 33:08.466
My getting her pregnant
with you fixed that.

33:08.541 --> 33:11.442
Get the picture?
Yeah!

33:16.650 --> 33:19.813
You know, normally I'm against
spreading men's room gossip.

33:19.886 --> 33:22.787
But in this case...
It would be criminal not to.

33:22.856 --> 33:26.087
Women were made to look at.
Impalas were made to drive.

33:26.159 --> 33:29.959
- Tequila's made for shooting, so...
- See you on the other side.

33:30.030 --> 33:32.419
Bobby, are we going
to the Peace Corps?

33:32.520 --> 33:33.295
Yeah.

33:33.366 --> 33:35.960
Then why did you accept
a job with your Dad?

33:36.036 --> 33:39.267
- Who told you that?
- I did.

33:39.339 --> 33:41.466
I overheard you and your dad
talking in the men's room.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.772
Oh, hiding in the john
Apeeping pervert.

33:44.844 --> 33:46.641
Is it true?

33:46.713 --> 33:48.647
My dad offered me a partnership.

33:48.715 --> 33:51.650
But I didn't want to spoil
the wedding for him, so...

33:51.718 --> 33:53.652
I told him I'd think about it.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.211
- That's a lie.
- Brat, I'm...

33:56.289 --> 33:58.951
Hey, hey! Hey!

33:59.025 --> 34:02.859
Unless you tell me the truth right now,
I'm canceling the wedding. Stop it.

34:02.929 --> 34:05.523
The truth is...

34:05.598 --> 34:08.623
that I'm gonna tell him no
after the wedding.

34:08.702 --> 34:10.897
You gonna turn down the house
after the wedding too?

34:10.969 --> 34:14.996
Go ahead and ruin that now.
That was supposed to be a surprise.

34:17.976 --> 34:19.911
Come here.

34:19.978 --> 34:22.038
Look, Dad got us a house,

34:22.114 --> 34:24.242
and I thought we could
rent it while we're away.

34:24.317 --> 34:27.878
That way we could have
a beautiful place to come back to,

34:27.954 --> 34:30.217
a place to start a family.

34:30.290 --> 34:33.918
- Honey.
- What?

34:33.993 --> 34:34.967
Honey, I love you.

34:34.969 --> 34:37.895
Cheryl, he has no intention
of joining the Peace Corps.

34:37.964 --> 34:40.797
Little brother, I don't know
why you're acting like this.

34:40.867 --> 34:44.234
I guess you think you're
helping out your sister here.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.362
But you're way off base.

34:46.438 --> 34:49.601
- Race him for pinks, Sam.
- What?

34:49.676 --> 34:53.237
He said, "You're way off base," punk.

34:55.915 --> 35:01.353
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Let him go. Let him go.

35:01.421 --> 35:05.289
Cam here's just saying
what he thinks is right.

35:05.358 --> 35:07.451
Cam, okay.
Now, that's enough.

35:07.527 --> 35:10.621
Now, I believe him, okay?

35:10.697 --> 35:12.631
Sam, race him for pinks.

35:12.699 --> 35:17.500
I'll race you for pinks.

35:17.570 --> 35:19.800
- What?
- Cam, don't be stupid.

35:19.873 --> 35:24.708
Okay, I'm stupid. But I think
the Mom-mobile can take him.

35:24.778 --> 35:28.111
Okay, um,

35:28.181 --> 35:33.209
how about 3:00 pm. Tomorrow
afternoon... at the underpass?

35:44.197 --> 35:47.223
What's so funny? I don't
think this is funny. It's...

35:51.938 --> 35:53.872
Why am I racing for pinks?

35:53.940 --> 35:56.465
I've been up against hot shots
like this Bob before.

35:56.543 --> 35:59.603
As long as they're in control,
you can't shake 'em.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.673
But if he loses to a hunk
of junk like the Mom-mobile,

36:02.674 --> 36:04.742
I guarantee you that Cheryl will see...

36:04.818 --> 36:08.151
the monster behind
that pretty boy mask.

36:10.657 --> 36:13.820
- I think you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

36:13.893 --> 36:18.193
There's one problem. Everybody knows
Bob has the fastest car on the boulevard.

36:18.264 --> 36:21.665
- But he doesn't have nitrous oxide.
- Laughing gas?

36:21.734 --> 36:24.134
Yeah, these guys don't
even know about it yet.

36:24.204 --> 36:27.071
During the race, you shoot it into
the car's intake manifold,

36:27.140 --> 36:29.506
and you get a huge
10-second burst of power.

36:29.576 --> 36:32.044
- Ka-za-zoom!
- That's great.

36:32.111 --> 36:34.545
Of course, if you inject
too much, you blow up.

36:34.614 --> 36:38.141
- Blow up?
- Yeah, you know.

36:38.218 --> 36:40.686
Big bang, fire, smoke.

36:47.594 --> 36:51.028
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Positive.

36:51.498 --> 36:53.489
Sort of.

36:53.566 --> 36:55.557
Okay, come here.

37:01.574 --> 37:04.737
Okay, I made the stopwatch
the on-off switch.

37:04.811 --> 37:09.111
So pressing this button starts
the stopwatch and the laughing gas.

37:11.184 --> 37:14.642
Sounds like we got a leak.

37:17.257 --> 37:21.421
There it is. Hand me
that crescent wrench, Cam.

37:22.829 --> 37:25.821
Here you go.

37:25.899 --> 37:30.768
If this works the way you say,
it could be dangerous.

37:30.837 --> 37:32.771
That's why we got the stopwatch.

37:32.839 --> 37:35.103
More than ten seconds and...

37:35.174 --> 37:39.201
This... This thing il blow up.

37:47.987 --> 37:49.978
Here he is.

37:57.597 --> 38:00.259
Didn't think you'd have
the "ganachos" to show.

38:02.068 --> 38:04.059
Where's your pink, man?

38:08.341 --> 38:10.866
Say bye-bye
to the Mom-mobile.

38:10.944 --> 38:15.438
Hey, gonna miss not having
this wreck around anymore.

38:15.515 --> 38:17.506
Where's Bob's pink?

38:28.695 --> 38:31.562
I'll count off the seconds for you.

38:31.631 --> 38:33.758
Out.

38:39.772 --> 38:41.763
Kick butt.

38:43.543 --> 38:45.534
Okay.

38:46.613 --> 38:48.547
Hey, hey, hey,
where you going?

38:48.615 --> 38:50.549
I'm gonna get out and watch.

38:50.617 --> 38:52.847
The best seat in the house
is right here.

38:52.919 --> 38:56.650
Okay. I'm not racing if Cheryl's in the car.

38:56.723 --> 38:59.157
She's staying.
Let's go.

38:59.225 --> 39:02.820
- No way.
- What, are you forfeiting?

39:02.895 --> 39:06.353
You chicken to race alone?

39:06.432 --> 39:08.423
Get out.
What?

39:08.501 --> 39:10.560
I said, get out.

39:10.637 --> 39:12.628
All right.

39:14.707 --> 39:16.698
Kiss it good-bye, drip.

39:21.214 --> 39:24.672
All right. Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go!

39:36.629 --> 39:40.395
Ready, get set, go!

39:46.572 --> 39:48.802
Go!

40:01.120 --> 40:04.351
Not yet!
You'll peak too soon!

40:04.424 --> 40:07.757
- Al, I love you.
- Just drive.

40:12.398 --> 40:13.922
Now!

40:29.148 --> 40:31.412
Yeah!

40:31.484 --> 40:35.580
- The Mom-mobile rules.
- I just don't believe it!

40:35.655 --> 40:38.488
Wasn't that a kick in the butt?

40:49.469 --> 40:52.461
Wow!

40:52.538 --> 40:54.233
Cam, look out!

41:01.114 --> 41:03.173
There's your car, pizza face!

41:03.249 --> 41:05.822
You tried to kill him!
You tried to kill my little brother!

41:05.823 --> 41:07.151
- What are you...
- I didn't, did I?

41:11.891 --> 41:14.883
Let's go home, Cam.

41:14.961 --> 41:17.555
Now, wait a minute, baby.
You're staying here with me!

41:17.630 --> 41:19.757
The hell I will!

41:26.405 --> 41:28.737
Don't you ever touch
my sister again.

41:44.157 --> 41:47.524
Get him. Get him!

41:51.164 --> 41:53.598
That was definitely
an uncool move.

42:42.114 --> 42:45.709
Still scared?
Uh-huh.

42:45.785 --> 42:49.346
But I'll get over it.
My little brother guaranteed it.

42:51.757 --> 42:54.624
You saved my life.

42:54.694 --> 42:57.629
No, no.
You saved yourself.

43:00.066 --> 43:03.900
<i>Coastliner for Santa Barbara,</i>
<i>San Luis Obispo, and San Francisco... </i>

43:03.970 --> 43:06.234
<i>now boarding on track four. </i>

43:16.582 --> 43:18.777
I got a going-away present
for you in the courtyard.

43:18.851 --> 43:22.218
A present?
But... you're the one going away.

43:22.288 --> 43:26.622
Just go to the shoe-shine stand
in the courtyard, okay?

43:29.228 --> 43:31.219
I love you, Cam.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.091
I love you too.

43:41.707 --> 43:47.145
<i>I bless the day I found you</i>

43:47.213 --> 43:52.776
<i>I want to stay around you</i>

43:52.852 --> 43:58.256
<i>And so I beg you</i>

43:58.324 --> 44:00.656
<i>Let it be me</i>

44:00.726 --> 44:03.160
Al.

44:03.229 --> 44:07.131
<i>Don't take this heaven from one</i>

44:07.199 --> 44:13.138
<i>If you must cling to someone</i>

44:14.140 --> 44:17.473
<i>Now and forever</i>

44:19.245 --> 44:22.681
<i>Let it be me</i>

44:22.748 --> 44:24.875
Hi, Sammy.

44:24.951 --> 44:29.012
Hello, Allie boy. Hey, look
what I picked up this morning.

44:29.088 --> 44:31.454
The girl or the car?

44:31.524 --> 44:33.992
Both.

44:34.060 --> 44:37.427
I met her at the car auction.
She offered to wax my hood.

44:37.496 --> 44:40.397
Well, she looks like
she does good work.

44:42.535 --> 44:45.504
So tell me, Al.
What happened to Cheryl?

44:45.571 --> 44:50.406
Oh, Cheryl, she's still in the Peace Corps.
She made it a lifetime commitment.

44:50.476 --> 44:52.979
She's in Africa with her
husband at the moment,

44:52.980 --> 44:55.641
and they're organizing a
food cooperative in Chad.

44:55.715 --> 44:57.706
That's great.

44:59.452 --> 45:02.785
So?
So... why haven't you leaped?

45:02.855 --> 45:04.846
- Yeah.
- Cam?

45:06.959 --> 45:11.828
I think maybe she's the reason.

45:18.237 --> 45:21.206
Cheryl insisted
on the eyelashes.

45:22.341 --> 45:25.037
Feels like they're gonna
fall off. They look great.

45:25.111 --> 45:27.477
You look great.

45:31.017 --> 45:34.077
You know,

45:34.153 --> 45:38.317
I always wished... that you
would be my first real guy friend.

45:40.026 --> 45:42.722
Your... first guy friend?

45:42.795 --> 45:44.729
Well, yeah.

45:44.797 --> 45:49.029
Well, the first one I didn't want
to sock or shoot with spitballs.

45:49.101 --> 45:51.535
Are you trying to
tell me you never...

45:51.604 --> 45:53.799
kissed anyone?

45:55.674 --> 45:57.665
Sam?

45:57.743 --> 45:59.836
Go ahead, do it.

46:08.454 --> 46:10.445
What's wrong?
Sorry.

46:10.523 --> 46:14.050
I just don't want to get
this stuff all over you.

46:15.294 --> 46:19.094
Okay.

46:19.165 --> 46:21.258
I'm ready.

46:21.333 --> 46:24.359
<i>And that you'll always</i>

46:29.942 --> 46:36.042
<i>Let it be me</i>

46:50.229 --> 46:51.920
Oh, boy.
