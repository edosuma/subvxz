00:50.080 --> 00:52.071
Come on, boy!

00:53.680 --> 00:58.470
<i>Chestnuts!
I've got some lovely hot chestnuts!</i>

01:52.920 --> 01:56.515
Here we are, Mr Bobster. Your favourite.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.597
<i>#... tidings of comfort and joy... #</i>

02:07.240 --> 02:11.631
Ah...! Ah...! Ah!

02:16.360 --> 02:18.157
<i># Oh, tidings of... #</i>

03:15.720 --> 03:18.757
Mr Bobster, are you all right, sir?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.152
Oh!

04:28.320 --> 04:30.914
Ah!

04:37.280 --> 04:38.793
Aah...!

05:05.280 --> 05:07.555
Aah...!

07:05.880 --> 07:09.793
<i>It was a cold,
snowy day in early December.</i>

07:09.960 --> 07:13.191
<i>Lack of funds had forced
my old school to close.</i>

07:13.360 --> 07:16.989
<i>I was being sent to a new one
in the middle of term.</i>

07:17.160 --> 07:21.153
<i>I was accustomed to the open
expanse of the country,</i>

07:21.320 --> 07:26.599
<i>and now I was in the heart of London,
at the height of the Victorian era.</i>

07:26.760 --> 07:30.469
<i>The streets teemed
with every activity imaginable.</i>

07:30.640 --> 07:33.279
<i>I was very taken by what I saw.</i>

07:33.440 --> 07:35.431
<i>Stepping from my carriage,</i>

07:35.600 --> 07:39.513
<i>the sight of my new school
filled me with apprehension.</i>

07:39.680 --> 07:44.117
<i>And yet, I was swept
with a wave of curiosity.</i>

07:44.280 --> 07:50.037
<i>However, nothing could prepare me
for the adventure that lay ahead,</i>

07:50.200 --> 07:55.320
<i>or the extraordinary individual
who would change my life.</i>

08:12.680 --> 08:14.671
There you are, sir.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.352
Stop! Isn't it valuable?

08:31.520 --> 08:34.432
What's more important,
its value or my sanity?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.989
I should have mastered it by now.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.515
- How long have you been playing?
- Three days.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.116
- Perhaps you should be patient.
- You're the new boy.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.556
Yes, I've transferred. My name is...

08:47.720 --> 08:49.950
Wait. Let me.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.711
Your name is James Watson.
You're from the north,

09:00.880 --> 09:04.350
your father's a doctor,
you spend much time writing,

09:04.520 --> 09:07.557
and you're fond of custard tarts.
Am I correct?

09:07.720 --> 09:11.508
- My name isn't James, it's John.
- What's the difference?

09:11.680 --> 09:15.355
- A great deal.
- Very well, so your name is John.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.876
- How did I do on the others?
- You were correct.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.591
On every count. How is it done?
Is it some sort of magic trick?

09:23.760 --> 09:27.639
No magic, Watson.
Pure and simple deduction.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.837
The name-tag on your mattress
reads "J Watson".

09:31.000 --> 09:33.434
I selected the most common name
with "J".

09:33.600 --> 09:36.592
- "John" was my second choice.
- Of course.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.876
Your shoes aren't made in the city.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.635
I've seen them before when visiting
the north of England.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.793
Your left middle finger has a callus,
the trademark of a writer.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.317
You were carrying a medical book
not available to the general public,

09:51.480 --> 09:55.632
only to physicians. Since you
can't have been to medical school,

09:55.800 --> 09:58.473
it was given to you by an older person,

09:58.640 --> 10:02.997
someone who is concerned for
your health: Your father, the doctor.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.355
- And the custard tarts?
- Simple.

10:05.520 --> 10:10.719
There's a stain of yellow custard
used in making tarts on your lapel,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.111
and your shape convinced me
you've eaten many before.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.352
- There's no need to be rude.
- Come on.

10:17.520 --> 10:22.594
- Hang on, where are we going?
- Do you want to miss Chemistry class?

10:22.760 --> 10:27.754
- By the way, what's your name?
- Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.119
The deductive mind never rests, Watson.

10:33.280 --> 10:37.432
It's like a finely-tuned instrument.
It demands practice.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.592
How does one go about
fine-tuning a mind?

10:40.760 --> 10:44.799
Problems of logic,
mathematical equations, riddles.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.589
For example, you're in a room
with an all-southern view.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.072
A bear walks by the window.
What colour is the bear?

10:53.240 --> 10:57.028
- The bear is red.
- Why would the bear be red?

10:57.200 --> 11:01.557
The southern sun is very hot.
The bear would be terribly burnt!

11:01.720 --> 11:04.757
That's the most absurd answer
I've ever heard.

11:04.920 --> 11:11.598
To successfully conclude
the experiment...

11:11.760 --> 11:13.239
...the experiment.

11:13.400 --> 11:18.952
To reiterate, experiment fourteen.

11:20.960 --> 11:26.478
Throw a small piece of potassium
onto some water.

11:26.640 --> 11:31.111
The liquid will be rapidly decomposed

11:31.280 --> 11:37.116
and so violent will be the action
that a large amount of light...

11:37.280 --> 11:41.068
Thank you.
He's being particularly boring today.

11:41.240 --> 11:47.679
...the production of potassium alkyl...
which will be dissolved...

11:47.840 --> 11:51.230
- That was a girl.
- Brilliant deduction, Watson.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.233
Who is she?
What's she doing in a boys' school?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.595
Her name's Elizabeth.

11:56.760 --> 12:01.038
Following her parents' death,
she came to live with her uncle,

12:01.200 --> 12:02.838
a retired schoolmaster.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.755
... such is modified by...

12:17.400 --> 12:22.030
Elizabeth was just admiring my new
timepiece. Would you like to see?

12:23.080 --> 12:26.789
- Very interesting.
- All stylish gentlemen wear them.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.679
- Expensive?
- From Bond Street.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.912
- I find that unlikely.
- I beg your pardon?

12:33.080 --> 12:37.119
Had you examined the face,
you'd see it is French in style.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.354
Yet according to this inscription,
the exterior was made in Switzerland.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.716
My suspicion was correct,
the works are Italian.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.997
Congratulations, Dudley,
your timepiece is a fraud.

12:50.160 --> 12:54.199
Keep your opinions to yourself, Holmes.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.517
I look forward to resuming
our conversation...

13:01.680 --> 13:04.399
...when there's a little more privacy.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.716
- Why did you do that?
- Dudley's a pompous ass.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.950
- He's very sweet.
- Really?

13:16.120 --> 13:20.636
Is that why you were standing
so close to him, flirting with him?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.791
Do I detect a sense of jealousy?

13:22.960 --> 13:26.589
Holmes, jealous?
That word is not in my vocabulary.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.594
- Neither is punctuality.
- You're angry because I'm late.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.992
<i>- As always.
- I'm sorry, but I can explain.</i>

13:35.160 --> 13:39.790
<i>- You had something more important...
- How can you say that?</i>

13:39.960 --> 13:43.475
<i>I was... Forgive me.</i>

13:51.040 --> 13:55.079
Elizabeth, let me introduce you
to my new friend,

13:55.240 --> 13:58.391
the honourable, but clumsy, Watson.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.473
- The ladder's a bit wobbly.
- Hello.

14:05.640 --> 14:10.839
Elizabeth! Holmes! I think I've solved
all of the problems!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.150
- Who's that?
- My uncle.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.153
Rupert T. Waxflatter,
retired schoolmaster.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.313
Degrees in Chemistry and Biology,
well-versed in Philosophy.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.278
- Author of 27 books.
- Incredible.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.796
- Most people think he's a lunatic.
- Why?

14:39.120 --> 14:41.111
Oh, my God.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.711
Ooh... oh...!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.232
Oh!

15:03.440 --> 15:06.557
A very hopeful sign.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.711
Very hopeful.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.597
Let me see, that makes six!
Six failed attempts!

15:20.760 --> 15:24.753
Nevertheless, we shall not
be defeated. We shall conquer.

15:24.920 --> 15:29.948
I have made up my mind.
The conquest of the skies is in my grasp.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.588
He's done this six times?

15:43.760 --> 15:45.751
I live here with Uncle.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.276
After he retired,
the school gave him the attic.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.431
It's incredible.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.995
I've spent many happy hours here.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.233
He's taught me more than
ten schoolmasters put together.

16:02.400 --> 16:08.350
- Uncas. Say hello to Watson.
- Say hello, Uncas. Say hello.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.637
Watson, he's not a parrot.

16:11.800 --> 16:17.318
- Have you found the weakness, sir?
- The wing material is inferior.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.278
I shall have to rebuild the entire machine.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.113
The entire machine?
Won't that be difficult?

16:24.680 --> 16:28.992
Elementary, my dear Holmes.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.551
Hm... Erm...

16:40.360 --> 16:42.954
You'll have to excuse me.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.432
Come on, come on, come on.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.473
- I've got it. The bear is black.
- What's that, old chap?

17:07.640 --> 17:11.076
- The bear in the riddle is black.
- Wrong again.

17:11.240 --> 17:16.108
Please don't disturb me while
I'm concentrating on the lesson.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.237
- Are you all right?
- I've sprained my ankle.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.392
Mrs Dribb, will you attend to him, please?

17:27.560 --> 17:32.190
Gentlemen, we cannot permit
ourselves lapses in concentration.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.591
We must work on technique,
rhythm and balance.

17:35.760 --> 17:40.993
There's no better pupil to illustrate
form and technique than Holmes.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.832
Study our stance,
our movements and our style.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.439
<i>En garde.</i>

18:02.840 --> 18:04.831
<i>TouchÃ©.</i>

18:26.200 --> 18:28.191
<i>TouchÃ©.</i>

18:37.080 --> 18:40.231
My game, Holmes.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.192
Now, gentlemen...

18:43.760 --> 18:48.038
...Mr Holmes lost
because of one important factor:

18:48.200 --> 18:51.431
His emotions took over.
He ignored discipline.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.592
Never replace discipline with emotion.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.751
Well played, Holmes.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.639
Amen.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.478
- I want to enlist. A general.
- Generals don't make any money.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.916
- I want to be an author.
- Authors don't make money.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.993
- I want to be a barrister.
- Barristers make money.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.630
I want to be a doctor.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.110
- Nobody asked you.
- Sorry.

19:49.280 --> 19:53.751
Holmes, what do
you want to be when you grow up?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.833
I never want to be alone.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.390
Uncas!

20:33.680 --> 20:35.398
Uncas!

20:45.760 --> 20:50.754
Why did you do that?
You left me all alone.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.278
There we go.

21:18.200 --> 21:21.158
Hello, is anybody there?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.071
Oh!

22:44.560 --> 22:48.712
Aah...! Ah! Ah...!

22:49.040 --> 22:50.996
Get out of the way!

22:52.960 --> 22:55.155
Aah...!

23:05.200 --> 23:07.509
Holmes is going to solve the crime!

23:08.240 --> 23:12.028
- Holmes is going to solve a crime!
- What?

23:12.200 --> 23:17.228
- Let's go!
- Did you hear? Holmes is going...

23:17.400 --> 23:19.994
<i>It was my second week at Brompton.</i>

23:20.160 --> 23:25.757
<i>With each passing day, my fascination
with Holmes continued to grow.</i>

23:25.920 --> 23:30.311
<i>On this occasion, the school
was bursting with excitement.</i>

23:30.480 --> 23:35.395
<i>Dudley had challenged Holmes
to a test of ingenuity and perception.</i>

23:35.560 --> 23:41.430
<i>Dudley had snatched the fencing
trophy and hidden it in a secret place.</i>

23:41.600 --> 23:45.479
<i>He gave Holmes 60 minutes
to find the trophy.</i>

23:45.640 --> 23:48.234
<i>Holmes accepted with confidence.</i>

23:48.400 --> 23:51.039
- The game is afoot!
- Hooray!

24:03.640 --> 24:07.110
Good luck, Holmes! Good luck!

24:27.720 --> 24:29.711
There he is!

24:31.880 --> 24:34.155
But this is truly despicable!

24:34.320 --> 24:37.312
Lmagine, a student
acting like a chimpanzee!

24:37.480 --> 24:39.630
Mr Snelgrove, he's just having fun.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.633
- Surely you remember what fun was?
- Fun

24:45.320 --> 24:49.950
This Holmes boy is too precocious,
too egotistical for his own good.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.270
He'll never find that trophy.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.432
- I'll wager a guinea he does.
- Done.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.273
- Ah!
- Uh.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.798
Excuse me.

26:02.560 --> 26:07.918
Holmes, you've only got one minute.
Holmes, you've only got...

26:08.080 --> 26:12.596
I heard you the first time!
Can't you see I'm concentrating?

26:40.160 --> 26:43.630
Only seconds left.
I assume you're giving up?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.836
Never assume anything.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.549
But Holmes, I see no sign of a trophy.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.711
But I do.

26:58.280 --> 27:03.149
Stop! Holmes, have you gone mad?
This is an antique!

27:27.680 --> 27:30.717
<i>It was a wonderful moment for Holmes.</i>

27:30.880 --> 27:36.273
<i>Little could he know his talents would
soon be put to a much greater test.</i>

27:36.440 --> 27:40.194
<i>A test of terrifying
and deadly proportions.</i>

27:40.360 --> 27:44.239
I came through the skylight
into the kitchen, giving them a fright.

27:44.400 --> 27:49.394
I noticed the particles of freshly-baked
ceramic beneath the oven.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.755
Odd for a kitchen used to prepare meals.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.390
So, the clues:
Red and green paint, ceramic.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.393
Pondering this, I kicked the snow
from my shoe.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.950
The snow crumbled and revealed
my shoe. This struck a chord.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.839
- You heard music?
- Watson, you buffoon!

28:05.000 --> 28:08.390
I'm talking about a parallel,
between my foot encased in snow

28:08.560 --> 28:12.075
and the trophy encased in some sort
of ceramic: A jar, a vase.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.789
- Painted with red and green paint.
- Exactly, Watson.

28:15.960 --> 28:20.670
Holmes! This time
I've definitely solved the problem!

28:20.840 --> 28:23.115
He's going to fly again.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.672
- Mr Lestrade?
- Holmes!

29:31.000 --> 29:34.913
It's been, what, three or four days
since your last visit?

29:35.080 --> 29:38.755
- This will only take a minute.
- There are no murder reports,

29:38.920 --> 29:42.435
- no casebooks you haven't read.
- I'm not here for research.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.670
- I'm on to something.
- Not again.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.956
- I'm certain of it.
- Really?

29:47.120 --> 29:52.592
Like when you thought the French
ambassador embezzled Â£300,000?

29:52.760 --> 29:55.911
- It was the Russian ambassador.
- Holmes, please!

29:56.480 --> 30:00.871
I don't have time for any more
of your... playpen crimes.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.315
Just have a quick look at these.

30:05.640 --> 30:09.474
- A suicide. A carriage accident.
- I suspect foul play.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.320
Why? They are completely unrelated.

30:13.480 --> 30:17.439
Wrong. Both men graduated
from the same university in 1809.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.033
Coincidence.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.430
Neither death fits their personalities.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.196
Bobster was a happy man, content
with his life, career and family.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.920
Why commit suicide?
He didn't even leave a note.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.675
Reverend Nesbitt is described
as loving and peaceful.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.957
Yet the carriage driver
insists he was crazed,

30:36.120 --> 30:38.554
in a panic when he ran into the street.

30:39.960 --> 30:45.034
A fluctuation of character
is not sufficient for an investigation.

30:45.200 --> 30:49.478
Keep your nose out of the "Times"
and into your school books.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.796
I appreciate your time, Mr Lestrade.
I suggest you hold on to these.

30:56.760 --> 31:01.117
If I were a detective sergeant
trapped in this room all day,

31:01.280 --> 31:06.400
I'd do everything in my power
to seek out that one investigation

31:06.560 --> 31:10.155
- that could promote me to inspector.
- Good day, Holmes.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.875
Holmes!

31:29.040 --> 31:31.315
What are you doing?

31:31.480 --> 31:33.755
Dudley dropped this.
I was giving it back.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.480
- I beg your pardon?
- Your paper.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.114
- It doesn't belong to me.
- You dropped it.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.672
- It isn't even my handwriting.
- Give it...

31:48.760 --> 31:51.228
These are the exam answers.

31:51.400 --> 31:56.679
It appears we have finally discovered
the secret of your intelligence.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.435
- But, sir...
- You better come with me.

32:12.840 --> 32:16.549
The fools!
Their age has turned them to granite.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.188
They only listen to themselves.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.750
- I thought they'd consider my record.
- They did.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.956
It did more harm than good.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.999
A record of that quality only convinced
the Board you'd cheated all along.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.276
- That's absurd.
- Well, Holmes,

32:31.440 --> 32:35.991
you were caught with the answers
in front of a classroom of students.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.594
Worse, the answers
were in your handwriting.

32:38.760 --> 32:42.958
An excellent forgery. Who'd have
suspected Dudley could pull it off?

32:43.120 --> 32:46.237
I can prove my innocence,
if you'd give me time.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.518
The Board quoted the school motto
five times during our meeting.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.036
- "Honesty, probity and diligence."
- Exactly!

32:54.200 --> 32:57.556
In their eyes, you've committed
the worst crime imaginable.

32:57.720 --> 33:02.430
And I'm being given the worst
punishment imaginable: Expulsion.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.354
Holmes, I will do everything
within my power to help you.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.115
I'll watch this Dudley fellow
and write a recommendation

33:10.280 --> 33:12.874
that will get you into any school
in England.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.953
- I appreciate that, sir.
- If there's anything else I can do...

33:19.040 --> 33:21.634
Oh, well, there is one thing.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.471
- One last duel.
- Yes, sir.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.390
Holmes. You all right?

33:43.560 --> 33:48.554
Fine. It's just a small cut.
I lost concentration for a moment.

33:48.720 --> 33:52.599
I should have removed my ring.
It was an unfair distraction.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.513
- The match is yours.
- Call it a draw.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.550
Come, let Mrs Dribb
look at that wound.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.993
Ah!

34:05.040 --> 34:09.476
- There we are.
- Thank you, Mrs Dribb.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.632
We're all going to miss you
around here, Mr Holmes.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.152
Come on, giddy-up.

34:31.639 --> 34:36.509
Dudley's going to pay dearly for this.
Punch to the jaw! Jab to the ribs!

34:36.679 --> 34:41.674
Now, Watson, revenge is sweetest
when it's served up cold. Come.

34:46.239 --> 34:49.232
Holmes!

34:49.400 --> 34:52.915
You did this!
You're responsible, aren't you?

34:53.080 --> 34:58.074
So that's where I dropped my
chemistry experiment: Into your tea!

34:58.240 --> 35:00.913
Don't worry, it will wear off shortly.

35:01.080 --> 35:05.073
You should be back to normal...
by summertime.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.798
Chestnuts, hot chestnuts!

35:20.840 --> 35:23.070
Chestnuts!

35:26.400 --> 35:28.038
Chestnuts!

35:39.360 --> 35:42.193
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.792
- Is your brother expecting you?
- I'll tell him when I arrive.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.872
Ah...! Ah...!

37:04.760 --> 37:06.751
Get 'em off me!

37:15.920 --> 37:18.514
Get them off me!

37:19.400 --> 37:22.119
Get 'em off me, please!
Get 'em off!

37:22.960 --> 37:24.757
Ah!

37:34.440 --> 37:36.749
- Get it off!
- No, sir, no!

37:41.280 --> 37:42.633
So, this is goodbye.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.793
I really expected us
to become good friends.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.234
What's going on?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.031
Sir! You dropped this!

38:22.600 --> 38:24.477
Eh Tar.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.314
Eh Tar.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.996
He seemed to go mad! He snatched
up a knife and stabbed himself!

38:36.240 --> 38:41.234
Eh Tar, Holmes. Eh Tar.

38:44.040 --> 38:47.396
Sir... No!

38:47.560 --> 38:49.676
- Please, no!
- Holmes!

38:49.840 --> 38:52.912
- I might have known.
- This is to do with...

38:53.080 --> 38:56.152
Get these two schoolchildren
away from here!

38:56.320 --> 38:59.153
Mr Lestrade, you've got to listen to me!

39:01.400 --> 39:05.154
Ho...! Ho!

39:10.880 --> 39:15.476
Man that is born
of a woman has but a short life...

39:15.640 --> 39:18.950
<i>A few days later,
they buried Professor Waxflatter.</i>

39:19.120 --> 39:23.875
<i>I had never been to a funeral before,
though I've been to many since.</i>

39:24.040 --> 39:29.319
<i>Holmes could not attend the funeral.
His expulsion prevented such a thing.</i>

39:29.480 --> 39:34.315
<i>The death of his mentor and friend
had taken its toll on Holmes.</i>

39:34.480 --> 39:38.837
<i>In my life, I have only seen Holmes
cry on two occasions.</i>

39:39.000 --> 39:41.992
<i>Today was the first.</i>

40:19.880 --> 40:23.236
No, Uncle didn't kill himself.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.873
<i>- He didn't? Then, what happened?
- He was murdered.</i>

40:29.720 --> 40:32.598
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse my entrance.

40:32.760 --> 40:37.151
I had to climb up the fire escape.
I can't afford to be seen.

40:38.840 --> 40:44.517
I only got halfway to Mycroft's home.
I had something gnawing at my insides.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.194
I ordered the driver to turn round.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.432
I'm going to miss him, too, Elizabeth.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.913
- He was very important to me.
- I'm so glad you're here.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.399
I had to come back.

41:02.560 --> 41:07.270
- You really believe he was murdered?
- I'm certain of it.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.876
Come on, you saw
Waxflatter's hand on the knife!

41:11.040 --> 41:13.395
It was obviously a suicide!

41:13.560 --> 41:17.348
Never trust the obvious. There are
too many puzzling elements.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.590
Firstly, a man jumps out of a window.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.799
Second, a reverend throws himself
under a carriage for no reason.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.589
Then Waxflatter stabs himself,
which is unbelievable.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.594
Another question. Why was Waxflatter
obsessed with their deaths?

41:31.760 --> 41:36.754
Yes, he'd saved those clippings,
and he kept meeting that odd man.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.832
He attended the funeral.
Do you know his name?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.675
No. When he visited,
Uncle sent me out of the attic.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.957
I asked about him,
but he changed the subject.

41:47.120 --> 41:51.398
That man is connected to all three
murders. We must find out who he is!

41:51.560 --> 41:53.710
You've been reading
too many detective novels.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.395
This is not fiction! There's a clever
murderer about, and I'll find him.

41:57.560 --> 42:01.712
- How?
- I'll live here. Work here.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.348
- If that's all right with you.
- Yes.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.956
- What if we're found?
- Only the three of us know.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.874
- Someone may see you!
- I'll take my chances.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.998
But you'll need food, supplies.

42:17.080 --> 42:20.311
Me?! I can't...

42:20.480 --> 42:22.914
You can run errands, be my assistant.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.514
I might get caught.
That would mean trouble!

42:25.680 --> 42:29.514
You'd let trouble ruin
an opportunity for adventure?

42:29.680 --> 42:32.752
I can't afford to jeopardise
my medical career.

42:32.920 --> 42:36.595
- Weasel.
- I'm not a weasel.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.752
- I am practical.
- Weasels are practical.

42:39.920 --> 42:44.835
And I imagined you courageous,
stout of heart.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.632
I am courageous.
And I'm stout of heart.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.631
It's just that...

42:57.440 --> 43:00.557
- All right, I'll do it.
- Thank you, Watson.

43:00.720 --> 43:04.395
Uncle would have wanted you
to have this.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.551
Please.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.671
Put it on.

43:19.680 --> 43:24.834
On second thoughts, take it off.
It looks very silly. You can't wear hats.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.837
I think it's very becoming.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.595
- You're teasing.
- No, seriously.

43:36.680 --> 43:40.116
<i>The following day, we set out
to solve Waxflatter's murder.</i>

43:40.280 --> 43:44.034
<i>We had very little to go on.
We only had two clues:</i>

43:44.200 --> 43:50.150
<i>Waxflatter's final words, "Eh Tar",
and the dropped blowpipe.</i>

43:50.320 --> 43:54.791
<i>It occurred to me
that when the cloaked figure ran off,</i>

43:54.960 --> 43:58.475
<i>I had heard a peculiar jingling sound,</i>

43:58.640 --> 44:03.156
<i>very much like the sound
I heard in the library at Brompton.</i>

44:03.320 --> 44:08.599
<i>Holmes was intrigued, and we
decided to visit the library that night.</i>

44:08.760 --> 44:12.878
<i>However, our first stop that day
was at Engle's Curio Shop.</i>

44:13.440 --> 44:17.194
Nice. Oh, very nice.

44:17.920 --> 44:23.472
Egyptian. The markings, the design,
that's Egyptian craftsmanship.

44:23.640 --> 44:27.633
- I've only seen this type once before.
- Where?

44:27.800 --> 44:32.271
On jewellery, on sculptures.
I had it here in the shop.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.795
- But I sold the lot.
- To whom?

44:34.960 --> 44:38.714
An Egyptian.
Keeps some sort of tavern.

44:38.880 --> 44:42.873
- And his name?
- Let's see...

44:48.000 --> 44:49.877
Mm...

44:57.800 --> 44:59.870
You promised to purchase something.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.235
- Watson, buy something.
- Me?

45:02.400 --> 45:05.198
- I'm short of funds right now.
- Rubbish.

45:05.360 --> 45:09.911
Don't be a penny-pincher.
That address could lead us to our killer.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.952
- How much do I need to spend?
- Buy anything!

45:18.120 --> 45:20.588
Why on earth did you buy a pipe?

45:20.760 --> 45:23.513
- It's distinguished.
- It's ridiculous.

45:23.680 --> 45:28.674
You'll see. I shall learn to smoke it,
then you can't laugh.

45:57.960 --> 46:02.988
What can I get for you boys?
Drink, food, women?

46:03.160 --> 46:06.630
- Do you have any soup?
- Watson, please.

46:06.800 --> 46:11.157
Are you the owner?
Have you seen this before?

46:12.920 --> 46:14.876
Rame Tep.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.996
Rame Tep! Rame Tep!

46:18.000 --> 46:20.070
Rame Tep!

46:24.320 --> 46:26.993
- Is that the end of the song?
- Where...?

46:29.400 --> 46:32.472
- Where did you get this?
- I happened upon it.

46:32.640 --> 46:36.189
Go! Take it away! Get out of here!

46:36.360 --> 46:40.114
It's very important.
Could you tell us something about this?

46:49.840 --> 46:55.153
Get out of my tavern, or these words
will be the last words you ever hear!

46:58.560 --> 46:59.993
Sir...

47:01.160 --> 47:04.038
We're leaving, we're leaving.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.515
Up there, the top shelf.
That's where I heard the sound.

47:12.680 --> 47:17.913
Holmes, please hurry. Do you know
what happens when we're caught?

47:23.680 --> 47:27.150
- Incredible!
- Holmes, your voice, keep it down!

47:27.320 --> 47:29.311
Sorry, Watson.

47:31.040 --> 47:36.034
- My God, that is remarkable!
- Holmes, please!

47:37.040 --> 47:40.191
Oh, God. Oh, God.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.590
What are my chances
of medical school?

47:44.760 --> 47:49.788
- That quaint office I've dreamed of...
- Listen. "The care to preserve..."

47:49.960 --> 47:54.829
<i>Holmes explained that the Rame Tep
were fanatical followers of Osiris,</i>

47:55.000 --> 47:56.991
<i>the Egyptian God of the Dead.</i>

47:57.160 --> 48:01.631
<i>They were scorned because
of their distortion of traditional beliefs,</i>

48:01.800 --> 48:04.268
<i>and their violent and sadistic rituals.</i>

48:04.440 --> 48:08.831
<i>The Rame Tep use a blowpipe
and shoot a thorn into their victim.</i>

48:09.000 --> 48:13.118
<i>The thorn is dipped into a solution
made up of plant extracts.</i>

48:13.280 --> 48:15.077
<i>Upon entering the bloodstream,</i>

48:15.240 --> 48:20.678
<i>the solution causes the victim realistic,
nightmare-like hallucinations.</i>

48:20.840 --> 48:24.549
- But we can be certain of one thing.
- What's that?

48:24.720 --> 48:29.555
The murderer is still here...
on school grounds.

48:29.720 --> 48:34.510
That's a rash statement, since this
jingling has been heard only once.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.319
- Twice.
- Twice?

48:37.480 --> 48:40.199
Remember a few nights ago
in the courtyard?

48:40.360 --> 48:43.636
Uncas heard a jingling sound
like you described.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.839
He took a piece of clothing from him.
It might still be here!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.798
We must find that piece of clothing.

48:50.960 --> 48:56.080
<i>We sprang into action, searching
every nook and cranny for the cloth.</i>

48:56.240 --> 49:01.109
<i>I accidentally turned on
one of Waxflatter's strange machines,</i>

49:01.280 --> 49:05.353
<i>and I had the dickens of a time
trying to turn the thing off.</i>

49:05.520 --> 49:08.512
I found it! I found it!

49:10.520 --> 49:17.278
<i>Holmes spent a night and day
examining the section of cloth.</i>

49:17.440 --> 49:21.592
<i>He conducted numerous experiments.
Not once did he rest.</i>

49:21.760 --> 49:27.073
<i>His energy seemed boundless.
Following 18 straight hours of work,</i>

49:27.240 --> 49:33.395
<i>Holmes turned to us, and those
four familiar words shot from his lips:</i>

49:33.560 --> 49:35.039
The game is afoot!

49:35.200 --> 49:38.158
<i>He explained it was Egyptian in origin</i>

49:38.320 --> 49:44.714
<i>and contained so many warp and weft
threads, which I didn't understand.</i>

49:44.880 --> 49:51.513
<i>The cloth was stained with paraffin
made only at Froggit and Froggit,</i>

49:51.680 --> 49:55.798
<i>located in Wapping in London,
a dark and dangerous place,</i>

49:55.960 --> 49:59.999
<i>and I told him so
in no uncertain terms!</i>

50:00.160 --> 50:04.153
Perhaps we should come back
in the morning when it's lighter,

50:04.360 --> 50:06.749
and when there are more people.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.994
- It's open.
- Holmes, wait.

50:13.160 --> 50:17.119
- What if the murderer's inside?
- Then I shall introduce myself.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.476
I knew it, there's no one here.
Back to school, eh?

50:50.640 --> 50:52.631
Watson, you'll be on your own.

51:11.920 --> 51:16.232
What do you suppose it is?
Some sort of Egyptian artwork?

51:16.400 --> 51:18.960
Some sort of statue?

51:19.120 --> 51:23.159
No, Watson, I'm afraid this is only
the tip of the iceberg.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.118
Ah...!

51:26.280 --> 51:28.589
Oh, no!

51:37.600 --> 51:39.591
This is an interesting development.

51:47.320 --> 51:51.916
There must be a passageway inside.
I hear chanting.

51:58.240 --> 52:03.314
Holmes, there's a door here!
Fancy him missing a door.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.075
Watson, Elizabeth, over here.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.952
It's some sort of temple.

53:31.720 --> 53:36.475
- I'm going down for a closer look.
- Let's get out of here alive!

53:36.640 --> 53:39.359
Stay here,
I'll be back in a few minutes.

55:13.920 --> 55:16.070
Stop! She's alive!

55:19.440 --> 55:22.989
Get him! Get him!

55:23.160 --> 55:25.116
Get him!

55:47.720 --> 55:49.517
- Ah!
- Ah!

55:49.680 --> 55:51.113
We got them!

56:49.400 --> 56:50.879
Elizabeth!

56:51.040 --> 56:53.031
Can you hear?

56:53.200 --> 56:55.794
Elizabeth!

56:59.040 --> 57:03.033
- What could have happened to her?
- Maybe she was hit by a thorn.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.159
Aah...!

57:22.240 --> 57:25.630
Elizabeth!

57:25.800 --> 57:29.793
- I think I hear something.
- You're right.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.595
Please! Please, Uncle! Don't!

57:40.840 --> 57:44.435
Please! Help me! No!

57:44.640 --> 57:47.200
- No...!
- Elizabeth!

57:47.360 --> 57:49.669
- Help me tie her down.
- What with?

57:49.840 --> 57:53.276
- My scarf! Quickly!
- I don't want to die!

57:56.000 --> 57:58.912
- It's a hallucination!
- Help me!

57:59.080 --> 58:03.756
It's not real! You're hallucinating!
Wake up!

58:03.920 --> 58:07.993
- You've got to wake up! It's not real!
- No, Uncle!

58:08.160 --> 58:12.870
- You're hallucinating. Listen to me!
- Please!

58:13.040 --> 58:18.797
It's a hallucination! Elizabeth,
listen to me! Now, Watson... Watson?

58:20.160 --> 58:24.756
- Dear God, not Watson, too!
- Please!

58:29.240 --> 58:31.356
Watson!

58:35.000 --> 58:37.150
Watson!

59:05.800 --> 59:07.597
Oh!

59:08.120 --> 59:10.156
Get 'im, get 'im, get 'im!

59:28.000 --> 59:29.433
No!

59:37.600 --> 59:39.591
No!

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.559
Please don't cry, Mother. Please!

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.235
Don't you understand, Mother?
Can't you hear me?

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.029
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Mother!

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.876
You! This is all your fault, son.
How could you do such a thing to me?

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.271
To your own father! Spying on me.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.910
Forgive me, Father, please.
I didn't realise...

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.029
My private life is my own!
Your mother need never have known!

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.752
No, no, no! This is not real!

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.514
This is not real!

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.871
Argh!

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.111
This is not real!

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.752
It's just a hallucination.
It's only in my mind.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.151
Maybe not!

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.031
No. Please, no!

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.193
Stay right there, or I'll blow
your bleedin' heads off!

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.552
I've convinced him to drop the charges.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.109
Holmes, you and your friends
have cost me a night's sleep.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.635
- Please, good morning.
- Mr Lestrade,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.270
these fanatics are responsible
for numerous deaths.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.117
I think they're responsible for the four
girls who disappeared last month.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.718
- I beg you, begin an investigation!
- Based on what, your imagination?

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.908
A great detective relies on perception,
intelligence and imagination.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.232
- Where'd you get that rubbish from?
- It's on the wall behind you.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.950
Oh, gosh...

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.033
I don't see why I should explain
my actions to you.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.354
I've spent seven years at Scotland
Yard, analysing hundreds of cases.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.354
With your background
of school books and headlines,

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.638
you consider you know more
than me. I despise your arrogance!

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.194
- And I despise your laziness.
- Out! All of you. Simply leave.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.990
If you have any investigative power
in you at all, you'll test these.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.948
- Maybe then you'll be convinced.
- Out, Holmes!

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.638
Oh!

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.072
Ow!

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.912
Blast.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.032
Holmes, please stop
that infernal tinkering.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.351
- I have a headache.
- Tinkering helps me think.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.910
- Sleep helps me think.
- There's no time for sleep!

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.392
We've got to find something
to link Waxflatter with the Rame Tep.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.432
- I've got a picture here.
- I want clues, not art critiques!

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.071
Clues. What do you think
I've been doing for the past hour?

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.792
Yes, Mr French Pastry, I have nothing
whatsoever to say to you.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.589
I trust you have nothing to say to me.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.153
What have you done with that painting?

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.398
- You know what you've found?
- Waxflatter as a young man?

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:22.156
Not just that. Bentley Bobster,
Duncan Nesbitt, Rupert Waxflatter.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.995
They've all died recently
except this man, Chester Cragwitch!

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.156
He was here and at the funeral.
He's the only man here still alive!

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.551
This is the clue we've been looking for.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.679
We're going to solve this crime.
Good show, Watson!

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.079
Holmes... I did not expect our foils
to cross so soon.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.798
- How did you know I was hiding?
- We share the same keen observation.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.192
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- I shall be needing your assistance.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.957
- Mr Holmes, I thought you'd gone.
- We were all under that impression.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.035
Now, unfortunately, Mr Holmes
is in a rather awful mess.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.320
If the Board knew, they'd probably
have you arrested and sent to prison.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.278
But there's no need to tell the Board.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.753
I'm willing to forget about this.
Tomorrow you go home, as planned.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.151
- Watson, you will do the same.
- I'm being expelled?

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:28.792
The Board would summarily expel you.
This saves you any such disgrace.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.715
Elizabeth, did you permit Mr Holmes
to stay in your uncle's study?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.713
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.077
I find that extremely unladylike behaviour.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.837
Indeed. May I suggest that we have
the dog taken to the pound?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.838
- What?
- Other schools do not allow pets.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.831
You can't take him away!

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.596
Perhaps, in the circumstances,
I should take care of him myself.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.278
Holmes, it grieves me that you've taken
advantage of my friendship.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.115
It is time to dispose of everything
in the Waxflatter laboratory.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:13.479
But, sir, it's filled with his inventions,
drawings and experiments.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.710
We mustn't cling to the past.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.872
- It's his whole life!
- And his life is over.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.469
- You have no right!
- Mr Holmes!

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.076
I'm surprised at your tone of voice,
especially with me!

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.234
- I apologise. I got a bit carried away.
- Take your seat.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.149
You'll have to stay overnight,
it's too late to find transport.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:41.714
Place the boys in 14B, and keep
the young lady in your adjoining room.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.231
Holmes.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.039
Remember what I always taught you.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.431
Control your emotions,
or they will be your downfall.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.591
Yes, sir.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.354
Oh, I knew it.
It's the end of my medical career.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.398
Father's going to be furious.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.473
I suspected becoming your friend
would end in disaster.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.030
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get us arrested?

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.749
- We can leave now.
- I'm staying here.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.311
Please, I need you, Watson.
We're in this together. We're a team.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.671
Elizabeth, wake up!

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.791
- This is Chester Cragwitch.
- The man who visited Uncle.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.077
- The one who ran from the funeral.
- Exactly.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.916
Isn't it odd that he's the only
surviving member of this group?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.119
Go back to the laboratory
and salvage as much as you can.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.751
We'll meet you there.
First, we've got to get out of here.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.435
- Watson.
- Yes.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.191
Holmes.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.115
Be careful tonight.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.710
This is too much.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:58.991
Go away, Rame Tep!
Bloody murderers, go away!

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.593
You won't get me!

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.957
Sir! Mr Cragwitch!

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.157
We were friends of Mr Waxflatter.

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:13.791
I know you. You're the youngster
that followed me at the cemetery.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.872
Go away! I'm a dangerous man
to be around!

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.908
I need your help. I want to know
why the Rame Tep killed five men.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.877
Go in.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.430
You can get up now, Watson.
The war's over.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.513
We were to become
business partners, all six of us.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.957
We borrowed money from our fathers
to build a hotel,

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.078
the most luxurious hotel ever conceived.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.674
And where better to build...

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.908
...than Egypt?

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.198
Labour and materials were cheap,
and only a few years earlier,

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.718
the British Army had driven out the
French. It was a land of opportunity.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.078
- What happened?
- We engaged an architect and began.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.591
But what started out
as a business venture...

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.753
...soon became
a major archaeological find.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.350
We discovered an underground pyramid.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.479
The ancient tombs
of five Egyptian princesses.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.475
We removed all the relics
and treasures to send to England.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.559
But... Oh!

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.553
Bloody insect.
Place needs a good cleaning.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.950
There was an uproar.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.318
The villagers were convinced
we'd desecrated sacred ground.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.471
Our lives were in danger.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.679
The British sent the troops in,
several people were killed.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.317
The entire village
was burned to the ground.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.756
<i>Burnt...</i>

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.512
Fire!

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.559
Ah!

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.678
- Are you all right?
- Fire!

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.832
- Fire!
- They've hit Cragwitch with a thorn!

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.150
- I'm burning! Fire!
- Listen to me!

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.030
Your name is Chester Cragwitch,
you're a banker. Can you hear me?

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.716
- Answer me, who are you?
- My name is Chester Cragwitch.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.476
I reside at Cragwitch Manor,
Hampstead...

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.712
My God, it was so real.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.673
Real, so very real...
Yes. I mustn't forget.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.391
I must pass on this information.
It is time someone else knew.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.031
- The village had burnt to the ground?
- Yes. Yes!

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.678
We got out of Egypt with our lives.
In England, we went separate ways,

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.834
all of us keeping in touch with
Waxflatter through correspondence.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.516
When the murders began,
I met frequently with my dear friend.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.557
What about the Rame Tep?

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.474
A year after the incident,
we all received this letter.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.156
It was sent by a young boy
of Anglo-Egyptian descent.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.195
You'll notice the letterhead is adorned
by the symbol of the Rame Tep,

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.352
two golden serpents.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.476
The boy and his sister
were in England with their grandfather

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:04.796
when they learnt of the destruction
of the village which was their home.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.516
Both their parents
were killed in the attack.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:15.596
The boy vowed that the Rame Tep
would take their revenge

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.673
and replace the bodies
of the five Egyptian princesses.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.197
- And the boy was called Eh Tar?
- Waxflatter's final words!

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.113
- Very good, Watson.
- Eh Tar!

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.716
You filthy murderer.
You wanted to kill all of us.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.032
- Well, you won't kill me.
- Watson, speak to him!

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.194
What? Oh... Your name
is Craggy Critch... Your name...

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.598
- Your name is... What's his name?
- Cragwitch...

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.037
Argh...!

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.760
Mr Lestrade!

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.835
- What are you doing here?
- I stuck myself with a thorn.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.514
The hallucinations... Ghastly.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.478
Took four policemen
to stop me hanging myself.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.473
So I thought
I'd better look into your story.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.076
Now, I wish you
and your podgy friend farewell.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.596
I appreciate you
getting me started on the case.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.230
Getting him started on the case?
Lmagine that.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.914
I've only done all the work for him.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.350
- It's you!
- Yes, my dear.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.552
Ah!

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.756
Aah...!

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.154
Mr Rathe, you must stop her,
she's a murderer!

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.233
So, my dear,
you've discovered our little secret.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.797
Where are your two friends?

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.476
You'll never find them.
You'll never find them.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.037
You'll never find them.
Never find them.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.830
- What shall we do with her?
- She'll come with us.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.560
We need the fifth princess.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.155
Holmes, I know the answer
to the riddle. The bear is white!

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.675
Good for you. Do you know why?

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.153
Well... No. It was the one colour
I didn't choose.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.630
Keep thinking.
Answers without evidence are useless.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.950
This riddle will give me a headache.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:13.148
- Eh Tar... Eh Tar...
- Can't you think of anything else?

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.676
- It's necessary.
- It is annoying.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.677
This silly bear puzzle, Holmes.
I can't work it out.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:46.551
I know the bear is white, but I don't
know why. I'm not stupid or anything.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:52.397
Think the whole thing through.
Take it apart piece by piece.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.552
Your face is bleeding again.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.112
This cut from Rathe's ring
never seems to heal.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.874
The bear is white because...

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.634
- Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
- What?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.117
It's Rathe, Watson. It's Rathe!

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.633
Giddup!

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.917
Come on!

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.119
Faster!

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.198
Giddup! Giddup, there!

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.711
Rathe's got Elizabeth!

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.999
- There's only one way to catch them.
- How?

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.628
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.992
This is madness!

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.754
It's our only chance
to get there in time.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.391
Waxflatter worked on it until he died,
and I've also done some tinkering.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.394
Hopefully, the problems are sorted out.
Coming, Watson?

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.551
Oh, dear...

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.676
- What have I got myself into?
- The adventure of a lifetime.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.274
Uncas, pull!

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.518
- It works, Watson, it works!
- We're flying!

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.275
- Would you believe it, Watson?
- We're flying!

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.798
Faster! Giddup!

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.353
Faster!

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.189
Holmes, down there!

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.672
Holmes, look out!

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.753
Ooh...!

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.754
My God, it's nearly half past twelve!

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.151
I've just realised I have no idea
how to land this machine!

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.671
- Hold tight!
- I'm holding!

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.150
This time we're going to crash!

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.913
- Hurry, we're sinking back here!
- All right!

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.312
Oh!

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.637
Oh, my God, they're going to kill her.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.870
Elizabeth.

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.630
Oh, Elizabeth.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.551
I don't know what to do.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:27.315
There are a hundred of them.
What can we do?

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.074
Perhaps we can apply something
we learnt at school.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.879
- For goodness' sake.
- I can't think of anything.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.353
- Why don't you think of something?
- Watson, that's not helpful.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.069
- Why can't I think of anything?
- You're flustered.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.549
- Why can't you?
- I'm flustered!

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.713
Watson, I've got it.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.317
- We must create a diversion.
- Create a diversion?

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:05.473
- Why didn't I think of that?
- If my geometry is correct,

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.634
one beam misplaced will bring down
this whole thing like a house of cards.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.952
Watson, I've a plan.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.833
Hurry, Holmes!

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.991
Holmes!

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.989
Aah...!

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.471
Argh...

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.915
Holmes...! Look out!

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.270
Holmes, are you all right?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.592
Watson, get her out of here!

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.872
Aah!

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.511
Oh, no...

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.150
Holmes!

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.313
Rathe's taken Elizabeth and the stairs
are blocked! What should I do?

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.392
Go around the other way!
You must stop him!

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.837
Holmes!

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.994
Holmes! Holmes! Holmes!

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.472
No!

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.514
What am I going to do?

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.358
No...!

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.030
Giddup! Ha!

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.596
Ya! Ya!

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.278
Aah...!

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.639
Good show.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.595
- Elizabeth, are you all right?
- I think so.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.351
Please...

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.953
- What are we going to do about Rathe?
- Where is he?

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.311
He's gone.

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:51.558
The police will find him.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.073
- Elizabeth...
- Strange...

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.275
Strange.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.434
Let's just go back now.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:08.837
I don't know how
I'll explain this to my parents.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.833
It'll all be explained
in tomorrow's papers.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.790
- Will you be allowed back to school?
- I don't know. Perhaps.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.630
- Holmes!
- No!

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.631
Damn!

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.357
Ah...!

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.830
- Put my coat around her.
- Where are you going?

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.553
- I'm going to get him.
- You'll be killed!

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.638
Eh Tar.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.870
You're nothing but a damned fraud!

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.636
And you are letting your emotions
get the better of you again.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.194
You cannot best me.
Throw down your sword.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.354
- Never. I'd rather die a horrible death.
- Very well. Then I will oblige.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.789
Come, is this the best you can do?
You fight like a child! I've already won!

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.270
You've lost every battle,
this will be no exception.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.193
All your dreams have been shattered!

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.636
Everything has been destroyed forever!

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:58.599
Ha...! Ha...! Ha...!

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.116
Ha...!

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.838
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.990
Yes, Holmes, let's tarry a while longer,

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.358
as your Elizabeth's precious lifeblood
flows from her body.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.760
Argh...!

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.113
Elizabeth, come on.
Wake up. Open your eyes.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.637
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.313
Holmes.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.791
Don't be sad.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.638
Someday, we'll be reunited.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.793
In another world. A much better world.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.913
I'll be waiting.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:59.073
And you'll be late... as always.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.594
Elizabeth... No.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.517
No.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.710
Elizabeth.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.510
Goodbye.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.549
You'd think he'd uncovered
the entire case on his own.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.234
That's what he wanted
the Yard to believe.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.394
What other reason would they have
for promoting him? Bye, Uncas.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.590
Stay there, Uncas,
I'll be back in a minute.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.275
You know, Holmes,
a few things still haunt me.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.353
Why did you suspect Rathe
was involved with the Rame Tep?

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.592
When Waxflatter retired,
the Board wanted him to leave.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.471
Rathe argued until he convinced
the Board to let Waxflatter remain.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.792
I could never understand why Rathe
wanted Waxflatter to stay.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.110
He liked Waxflatter's inventions?

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.558
What's wrong with you? Have you
been asleep through this entire case?

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.039
Sorry.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.637
<i>Holmes explained that Rathe
spent years plotting his revenge.</i>

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.349
<i>He established himself
as a respected member of society,</i>

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.239
<i>completely erasing
his former identity.</i>

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.472
<i>It took a long time
to organise his followers,</i>

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.713
<i>made up of the poor, the homeless,
the lost souls of the streets.</i>

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.271
<i>Also, it took time to build
a wooden replica of the pyramid.</i>

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.989
<i>Mrs Dribb was the Rame Tep's
chief assassin,</i>

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.233
<i>but, more importantly,
she was Rathe's younger sister.</i>

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.554
Amazing, Holmes, simply amazing.

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:09.430
- You did forget one important clue.
- Oh? Please enlighten me.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:15.391
- "Rathe" is "Eh Tar"' spelt backwards.
- Very clever, Watson.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.949
I would have seen that sooner or later.

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.908
Sooner or later. Are you coming back
after the holidays?

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.517
No, I'll transfer.
There are too many memories here.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:33.070
- You have your entire life ahead of you.
- And I'll spend it alone.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.354
Merry Christmas, Holmes.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.108
I thought you might have more luck
smoking it.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.910
- Well?
- Seems to suit you. But that coat...

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.676
Why do you wear that ridiculous cloak
of that unspeakable person?

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.071
Consider it a trophy.
The skin of a leopard.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.437
- Indeed.
- I'm going to miss you, Watson.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.998
I'm going to miss you too, Holmes.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.628
- You were right about something.
- What?

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.793
It was the adventure of a lifetime.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.152
- Wait! I know why the bear's white!
- Why is that?

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:30.155
A room with an all-southern view
is on the North Pole. It's a polar bear!

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.357
Bravo. You have the makings
of a great detective.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.477
<i>As I watched Holmes settle in,
a sudden feeling came over me,</i>

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.394
<i>that I would most certainly
be seeing him again.</i>

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.633
<i>So ended my first adventure
with Mr Sherlock Holmes.</i>

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:54.432
<i>As I watched his carriage disappear,
I realised that I'd forgotten to thank him.</i>

01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:00.232
<i>He'd taken a weak, frightened boy
and made him into a courageous man.</i>

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.555
