WEBVTT

00:11.517 --> 00:14.310
- Okay. So, for our
Sky Whale update,

00:14.379 --> 00:17.000
I was thinking we could
release a brand new level,

00:17.068 --> 00:19.413
which I'’m calling...

00:19.482 --> 00:22.206
Groovetopia.

00:22.275 --> 00:26.724
- Ooh, Groovetopia,
that sounds like a kick.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.965
- Yeah, see, after you'’re
in outer space,

00:29.034 --> 00:30.665
you keep going higher
and higher, '’til you'’re

00:30.689 --> 00:33.241
in this weird, groovy,
alternate reality where...

00:33.310 --> 00:36.103
- Hey! Anybody want
some juice?

00:36.172 --> 00:38.655
- Juice?
- Yeah.

00:38.724 --> 00:41.586
- But you'’re making a sandwich.

00:41.655 --> 00:45.103
- Yes, but after I make it,
I'’m gonna juice it,

00:45.172 --> 00:47.172
then drink it.

00:47.241 --> 00:48.758
- Yeah...

00:48.827 --> 00:51.689
I don'’t think you understand
the spirit of juicing.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.206
- And here comes Double G
in his helicopter again.

00:59.275 --> 01:02.620
- Ugh, how many times
have we asked you to tell

01:02.689 --> 01:05.793
your dad that he can'’t land
his helicopter on our roof?

01:05.862 --> 01:07.482
- I told him just last night.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.137
- And what'’d he say?

01:09.206 --> 01:12.586
- He said, "Bah ha ha ha!
I'’m Double G!

01:12.655 --> 01:16.724
I land my helicopter
wherever I want!"

01:16.793 --> 01:19.034
And then he stuck
his finger in my yogurt.

01:19.103 --> 01:21.655
- Why?
- Just to make it dirty.

01:24.344 --> 01:27.448
- Well, why'’s he comin'’ here
in his helicopter anyway?

01:27.517 --> 01:29.448
- He'’s teachin'’ Bunny
how to fly it.

01:29.517 --> 01:34.172
Today they'’re
workin'’ on landing.

01:39.793 --> 01:42.482
- Smooth landing, Bunny!

01:42.551 --> 01:45.379
- Okay, guys,
now I'’m gonna extract

01:45.448 --> 01:48.379
all the healthy juice,
right outta this sandwich.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.206
- Hey, Bunny.
- Hi, Bunny.

02:01.275 --> 02:04.448
- Gotta pee, gotta pee,
gotta pee, gotta pee...

02:04.517 --> 02:06.206
- And he'’s gone.
- See ya.

02:06.275 --> 02:07.586
- Hey hey!

02:07.655 --> 02:09.044
You Game Shakers got
a problem with your roof.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.275
- What'’s the problem
with our roof?

02:11.344 --> 02:12.689
- Bunny broke it.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.551
Ha-ha!

02:14.620 --> 02:18.172
Ooh! Juice!
A-ha-ha-ha...

02:18.241 --> 02:19.655
Mmmm...

02:22.655 --> 02:25.068
Bad juice!
Bad juice!

02:25.137 --> 02:26.137
Ah!

02:31.655 --> 02:32.655
- Aww! Dang it!

02:32.724 --> 02:34.793
- What?
- You guys see this?

02:34.862 --> 02:37.793
Icon'’s retiring!
- No way!

02:37.862 --> 02:39.379
- Wait, who'’s Icon?

02:39.448 --> 02:42.965
- Uhh... He'’s like
the best gamer ever.

02:47.103 --> 02:48.482
- Hey!

02:48.551 --> 02:50.862
Do y'’all have any
mouth detergent?

02:52.551 --> 02:54.586
- Man, I'’m bummed.

02:54.655 --> 02:56.724
You know how bad I wanted
to play against that guy?

02:56.793 --> 03:00.034
- Hey, no offense buddy,
you'’re a great gamer...

03:00.103 --> 03:03.827
but compared to Icon,
you'’re lame and weak.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.517
- Y'’know, saying "No offense"

03:07.586 --> 03:09.793
is not a license
to offend people.

03:14.172 --> 03:17.448
- Well, how come you never
challenged Icon to a match?

03:17.517 --> 03:19.172
- I did! I tweeted him
like a dozen times,

03:19.241 --> 03:20.724
but he never responded.

03:20.793 --> 03:24.103
- Yeah, but you don'’t have
41 million followers.

03:24.172 --> 03:25.344
Hey Dub!

03:25.413 --> 03:26.793
Can I see your phone for a sec?

03:26.862 --> 03:30.758
- Ah! Sure!
Let me just... ah.

03:33.931 --> 03:37.000
- "Hey Icon, my kid, Triple G,

03:37.068 --> 03:41.206
challenges you to any game,
any time. Hit me back...

03:41.275 --> 03:44.310
if you'’ve got the guts."
There.

03:44.379 --> 03:45.659
- Why do you
think that'’ll work?

03:45.724 --> 03:47.517
- '’Cuz it comes
from Dub'’s account.

03:47.586 --> 03:49.146
The whole world'’s
gonna see that tweet,

03:49.172 --> 03:50.379
so Icon can'’t ignore it.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.965
- Yeah, he will.
He'’s not gonna respond.

03:54.379 --> 03:56.862
- And he responded.
- He did?

03:56.931 --> 03:58.275
- For real?
- What'’d he say?

03:58.344 --> 04:01.655
- He wrote:
"Hey Double G. Big fan.

04:01.724 --> 04:03.241
I'’ll take your kid on.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.310
Tell him to meet me
Friday night, nine o'’clock,

04:05.379 --> 04:07.137
at The Hole."

04:07.206 --> 04:10.068
- Yes! That'’s awesome!

04:10.137 --> 04:12.758
I get to play against
the best gamer out there!

04:13.862 --> 04:15.517
- Oh! Hey Dub,
you got a text.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.448
- Oh! Just read it to me.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.103
- Okay, oh!
It'’s from Bunny.

04:19.172 --> 04:24.275
He says, "Hey Dub, I dropped the
helicopter keys in the toilet."

04:24.344 --> 04:26.448
- Ah! Tell him not to flush!

04:26.517 --> 04:27.655
- Okay! Okay!

04:27.724 --> 04:28.862
I'’ll tell him not to flu...

04:31.172 --> 04:35.068
- Ah!

05:46.206 --> 05:47.655
- Yeah, me neither.

05:49.448 --> 05:50.931
- Okay, we'’re gonna
go grab a drink.

- Hey!

05:52.344 --> 05:55.103
See if they can juice me
a piece of pizza!

05:55.172 --> 05:56.827
- Come on Hudson!

05:59.931 --> 06:01.034
- What do you want?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.793
- Hey, hey.

06:09.344 --> 06:10.896
- Hey, you guys, Icon'’s here.

06:10.965 --> 06:12.241
- I know!

06:12.310 --> 06:15.896
- Hey dude, look,
he'’s staring at you.

06:18.103 --> 06:19.206
- Well, what do I do?

06:19.275 --> 06:20.310
- You gotta stare back.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.758
- Yeah, stare back!
- Do it!

06:35.586 --> 06:36.862
- You Triple G?

06:36.931 --> 06:38.448
- Maybe. Who'’s askin'’?

06:38.517 --> 06:41.655
- She is.

06:41.724 --> 06:44.310
- My name'’s Roz,
I'’m with Soba Sportswear.

06:44.379 --> 06:46.000
We sponsor Icon.

06:46.068 --> 06:47.896
- Cool!

06:47.965 --> 06:51.310
Hey, after Icon beats Trip,
can I get a selfie with him?

06:51.379 --> 06:53.000
- What?
- Dude!

06:53.068 --> 06:54.206
- Hudson!

06:54.275 --> 06:57.931
- Icon'’ll be ready
in two minutes.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.586
I hope you are.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.551
- Don'’t worry Trip.
You can beat Icon.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.137
- I hope so.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.517
Awww, my hands are so cold.
I gotta warm '’em up.

07:07.586 --> 07:10.103
- Here...

07:10.172 --> 07:12.413
Stick '’em down there.

07:12.482 --> 07:14.965
- No, thank you!

07:16.241 --> 07:18.793
- Right now we got us
a challenge match.

07:18.862 --> 07:22.310
All right.
Legendary gamer, Icon...

07:26.931 --> 07:28.931
- Yeah! Woo!

07:29.000 --> 07:32.137
- Is goin'’ up against
a kid named...

07:32.206 --> 07:33.206
Triple G.

07:33.275 --> 07:34.586
- Yeah, Trip!
- Woooo!

07:34.655 --> 07:36.482
- All right.

07:37.448 --> 07:39.655
- All right, game up!

07:42.310 --> 07:44.931
- Expert level.
No cheat codes.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.689
The first player
knocked out, loses.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.931
Challenger,
choose your character.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.896
- I choose:
The Red Flaming Ninja.

07:59.034 --> 08:02.586
- I choose:
The Psycho Knife Beast.

08:06.448 --> 08:07.793
- Yeah!

08:07.862 --> 08:09.206
Oh.

08:09.275 --> 08:10.413
- Good luck, Icon.

08:12.344 --> 08:14.931
- Oooh!

08:15.000 --> 08:17.655
- Trip, you can do this.
- We believe in you.

08:17.724 --> 08:21.586
- Did you know that
Icon'’s never lost?

08:24.482 --> 08:26.172
- All right, here we go!

08:26.241 --> 08:28.103
- Fight!

08:38.482 --> 08:41.068
- Ah! No!
Okay. It'’s okay.

08:41.137 --> 08:42.320
- You can come back.
You can come back, Trip.

08:42.344 --> 08:43.344
Come on!

08:43.413 --> 08:46.275
You gotta keep playing!

08:48.931 --> 08:50.620
- C'’mon Icon,
what are you doin'’?

08:52.206 --> 08:55.000
- You got it!
Fire punch! Fire punch!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.206
Go for it!

09:02.896 --> 09:05.517
- Winner! Flaming Ninja.

09:09.206 --> 09:10.689
- I'’m sorry.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.586
- Hey, don'’t be.

09:12.655 --> 09:14.517
Win or lose,
you'’re always gonna be

09:14.586 --> 09:16.172
number one at Soba Sportswear.

09:16.241 --> 09:17.655
- Thank you.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.965
- Triple G...

09:21.034 --> 09:23.724
how would you like to be the
new face of Soba Sportswear?

09:23.793 --> 09:26.517
- But... but...
But what about Icon?

09:26.586 --> 09:29.103
- You mean I-GONE?

09:32.275 --> 09:33.517
So, you want the gig?

09:33.586 --> 09:34.862
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, okay!

09:34.931 --> 09:36.965
- All right!
- Better get ready, kid.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.586
You'’re gonna be playing
a lotta games.

09:38.655 --> 09:42.172
- Well, that'’s just a
sacrifice I'’ll have to make.

09:42.241 --> 09:43.172
Ha! Gotcha!

09:43.241 --> 09:44.655
Gotcha!

09:44.724 --> 09:46.551
- Oh my God, Trip!
Congratulations!

09:46.620 --> 09:47.827
That'’s awesome.

09:47.896 --> 09:50.620
Try to get us a buncha
free Soba stuff.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.310
- Sorry Mister Taco,
time to get juiced.

10:17.689 --> 10:20.137
Hasta la taco, baby!

10:21.689 --> 10:25.482
- And I tap, and my narwhal
goes over that thing...

10:25.551 --> 10:26.931
- Rainbow toga blastoff!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.137
- Ah! Groovetopia
looks so cool.

10:29.206 --> 10:30.482
- Uh, yeah!

10:30.551 --> 10:32.965
We'’re gonna make
mad cabbage on this game.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.965
- Mmmm!

10:39.034 --> 10:40.482
- Hey, where'’s Trip?

10:40.551 --> 10:42.044
We need him to test this
level and give us feedback.

10:42.068 --> 10:43.482
- He promised
he'’d be here today.

10:43.551 --> 10:45.389
- Yeah, and he promised
he'’d be here yesterday,

10:45.413 --> 10:47.862
and the day before that,
and the day before that.

10:47.931 --> 10:49.103
- I just saw him.

10:49.172 --> 10:52.275
- Where?
- Inside my Pear Pad.

10:52.344 --> 10:53.379
- What do you mean?

10:53.448 --> 10:55.310
- Check out Pop News Nation.

10:55.379 --> 10:59.517
- Let'’s start off talking about
world-class gamer, Icon.

10:59.586 --> 11:01.620
- Bye bye, Icon.

11:04.724 --> 11:07.655
- After being defeated
for the first time ever,

11:07.724 --> 11:10.000
Icon got booted
by Soba Sportswear.

11:10.068 --> 11:14.275
- And replaced by
Game Shaker Triple G.

11:14.344 --> 11:16.355
- The new champion was back
at The Hole the next night,

11:16.379 --> 11:18.000
defending his title by defeating

11:18.068 --> 11:21.448
the fifth-ranked
challenger, Kill Shot...

11:24.482 --> 11:29.137
- Winner! Flaming Ninja.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.655
- Oh, and one of our PNN
spies got video of Triple G,

11:31.724 --> 11:33.931
laughing and drinking
unpasteurized juice

11:34.000 --> 11:36.275
with Jennifer Lawrence...

11:45.034 --> 11:48.517
- Hey hey, what'’s up
little Game Shakers?

11:48.586 --> 11:50.241
- There you are.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.562
We'’ve been waiting four days
to get your feedback

11:51.586 --> 11:52.665
on this new Sky Whale level.

11:52.689 --> 11:53.827
- Yeah.

11:53.896 --> 11:55.448
- Ah! I'’m sorry, I'’m sorry...

11:55.517 --> 11:57.251
I'’m done with Soba stuff for
the whole rest of the day,

11:57.275 --> 12:00.965
so let'’s do some Game Shakin'’.

12:01.034 --> 12:03.379
- Let'’s do it!
- Wheeee!

12:05.551 --> 12:08.241
- Okay, we got the Groovetopia
level working really well.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.562
- But we need you to play it
and tell us whether you think

12:10.586 --> 12:12.217
it'’s up to code so
we can release it to the...

12:12.241 --> 12:13.458
- All right, I need you to
get those on Trip.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.034
I need you to
make him look fantastic,

12:15.103 --> 12:16.862
and don'’t disappoint me.

12:16.931 --> 12:18.758
- Okay, wh-what'’s going on?

12:18.827 --> 12:20.551
- Why is the Soba lady here?

12:20.620 --> 12:22.275
- Uh... I'’m not sure.

12:22.344 --> 12:24.965
Hey, Roz, you said I was done
with Soba stuff for today.

12:25.034 --> 12:27.379
- Oh yeah, but Soba'’s
not done with you.

12:27.448 --> 12:30.586
We just booked you for a press
event in SoHo at six o'’clock.

12:30.655 --> 12:33.172
Uh, put some makeup on him
and fix his hair.

12:33.241 --> 12:35.620
- What'’s wrong with his hair?

12:35.689 --> 12:38.655
- I don'’t know you.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.068
Get those pants off.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.241
- My pants?

12:43.310 --> 12:46.310
- Yeah, we gotta put you
in Soba'’s new Action Pants.

12:46.379 --> 12:48.655
- Wh... I'’m not
changin'’ my pants

12:48.724 --> 12:49.965
in front of everybody here!

12:50.034 --> 12:53.551
- C'’mon man, don'’t be a prude.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.758
- Hold up the privacy sheet
so Trip can change.

12:56.827 --> 12:58.482
- Wait! But I promised
Babe and Kenzie

12:58.551 --> 13:00.355
that I'’d help '’em with th...
Okay, just gonna...

13:00.379 --> 13:01.827
All right, fine.

13:01.896 --> 13:04.379
- Okay, we'’re never gonna
get this game finished.

13:04.448 --> 13:06.000
- Uh, Miss...

13:06.068 --> 13:07.700
we really need Trip
to stay here and help us

13:07.724 --> 13:09.620
with our new game because
we got a lot of...

13:09.689 --> 13:11.379
- Hey, you want this Soba hat?

13:11.448 --> 13:15.413
- Oh, yes I do!

13:15.482 --> 13:18.482
- Seriously Roz, Trip works
for Game Shakers. Okay?

13:18.551 --> 13:21.034
So you can'’t just take him away
from us whenever you want.

13:21.103 --> 13:24.344
- This contract Trip
signed says I can.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.655
Do you have a contract
with Trip?

13:26.724 --> 13:31.931
- Well, no, um, no not
a not a contract, per say.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
- Uhh, Roz...

13:34.068 --> 13:36.172
I don'’t know about
these Action Pants.

13:36.241 --> 13:38.068
- C'’mon, let'’s see '’em!

13:44.137 --> 13:46.068
- I feel restricted.

13:46.137 --> 13:47.758
- They'’ll stretch.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.034
Now grab your stuff,
we gotta head to SoHo. What?

13:50.103 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, I got him,
I'’m on my way...

13:55.793 --> 13:58.413
- Look, if you guys are
cool stayin'’ late tonight,

13:58.482 --> 14:00.631
I promise I'’ll be back here
to work by eight o'’clock.

14:00.655 --> 14:02.344
- No, you won'’t.

14:02.413 --> 14:04.527
You have a nine o'’clock dinner
with Soba'’s marketing director.

14:04.551 --> 14:07.758
- I promise I'’ll be back
here to work by ten-thirty.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.000
- No, you won'’t.

14:09.068 --> 14:12.517
- D'’oh, I'’m never comin'’ back!

14:12.586 --> 14:15.172
So uncomfortable!

14:17.689 --> 14:19.379
Per say.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.965
- Dub, he'’s not gonna be here.

14:32.034 --> 14:33.517
- You said this is
his favorite place.

14:33.586 --> 14:35.965
- Sir! You can'’t stay here,
we'’re closing.

14:36.034 --> 14:37.793
- I'’m lookin'’ for my son.

14:37.862 --> 14:40.000
- Daddy?

14:40.068 --> 14:41.275
- What?

14:41.344 --> 14:42.596
- I knew you'’d come
for me one day.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.965
- No, no!
No, he'’s not your daddy.

14:46.034 --> 14:48.206
- Oh.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.035
- We'’re lookin'’ for a kid,
about this tall,

14:50.068 --> 14:52.379
probably wearing Action Pants?

14:53.758 --> 14:57.413
- Did you hear that?
- I know that sneeze.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.896
- Trip, what are you
doin'’ down there?

15:03.965 --> 15:05.827
- Uh, sorry!

15:05.896 --> 15:08.275
Trip'’s not here right now!

15:08.344 --> 15:09.793
Ow!

15:09.862 --> 15:11.724
- Come on, Trip.

15:11.793 --> 15:14.379
Why are you hidin'’
under there like a dog?

15:14.448 --> 15:16.379
Come here.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.000
- I don'’t want Roz to find me.

15:20.655 --> 15:22.251
- I thought you loved
workin'’ with Soba.

15:22.275 --> 15:24.620
Playing games,
getting free stuff,

15:24.689 --> 15:26.517
hangin'’ with Jennifer Lawrence.

15:26.586 --> 15:30.241
- Oh my God,
I love Jennifer Lawrence.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.689
- Man, don'’t you have
somewhere you ought to be?

15:32.758 --> 15:35.620
- Yes. With my daddy.

15:37.206 --> 15:39.103
- Look, at first,

15:39.172 --> 15:41.206
I loved the idea of
being sponsored by Soba

15:41.275 --> 15:42.655
and all this cool free stuff.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.517
But they'’re
working me to death!

15:44.586 --> 15:48.344
And I... I just wanna go back
to being a Game Shaker.

15:48.413 --> 15:51.379
- Hey, I feel ya dude.

15:51.448 --> 15:54.965
But Soba'’s gotcha.
You signed a contract.

15:55.034 --> 15:56.724
- Yeah.

15:58.413 --> 15:59.448
- Squat!

16:00.965 --> 16:02.586
- What?

16:02.655 --> 16:05.482
- Hey Trip, remember the time
I had the deal with Squat Soda?

16:05.551 --> 16:07.068
The soda that tastes like squat?

16:07.137 --> 16:09.275
- Oh yeah, Squat Soda!

16:09.344 --> 16:11.000
- I drink Squat Zero.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.931
- Wait... Didn'’t Squat fire you?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.689
- No, no.
I made them fire me!

16:15.758 --> 16:17.458
See, I figured they
weren'’t payin'’ me enough,

16:17.482 --> 16:19.827
so I put on
my Squat Soda t-shirt,

16:19.896 --> 16:22.103
went up to the top of the
Empire State Building,

16:22.172 --> 16:24.448
and then I peed off the roof!

16:25.482 --> 16:26.758
- Oh yeah, I remember that!

16:26.827 --> 16:28.482
- Me too!

16:28.551 --> 16:31.206
Uh, didn'’t your pee land on a
bus full of German tourists?

16:31.275 --> 16:32.965
- Yup! That'’s right!

16:33.034 --> 16:35.034
- It was all over the news.

16:35.103 --> 16:36.896
- It was all over the bus.

16:36.965 --> 16:39.827
- And the next day,
Squat Soda fired me!

16:39.896 --> 16:41.689
No more contract.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.482
- Right, because
they didn'’t wanna be

16:43.551 --> 16:46.206
associated with you anymore!
- Nobody did!

16:46.275 --> 16:47.965
- What... but... I mean...

16:48.034 --> 16:50.251
you'’re not sayin'’ that I should
do somethin'’ terrible,

16:50.275 --> 16:53.344
just to make Soba fire me.
- Yes, I am.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.448
- I'’m on board with this plan.

17:08.448 --> 17:09.689
- How'’s it look?

17:09.758 --> 17:11.551
Does it look like
a real person'’s ear?

17:11.620 --> 17:13.551
- Kenzie, what do you think?

17:13.620 --> 17:17.310
- Wow! Nice ear!

17:17.379 --> 17:19.413
It even feels real!

17:19.482 --> 17:20.655
- Right?

17:20.724 --> 17:22.586
- Where did Bobby Dong get this?

17:22.655 --> 17:24.079
- I dunno, he just said
"It'’s fresh"

17:24.103 --> 17:26.724
and I didn'’t want to
ask any more questions.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.793
- Do it Trip!
You got this!

17:30.862 --> 17:33.172
You got '’im!
Take '’im out!

17:34.068 --> 17:35.586
Yeah!

17:37.655 --> 17:40.896
- Winner! Flaming Ninja.

17:40.965 --> 17:43.931
- Okay, Soba'’s very own
Triple G does it again!

17:46.827 --> 17:49.827
- Nobody can beat this kid!
- Aw, come on now.

17:49.896 --> 17:52.344
But it'’s true.
It is true.

17:52.413 --> 17:54.310
- Go go go! Talk trash!

17:54.379 --> 17:55.827
- And Trip knows what to do?

17:55.896 --> 17:58.137
- Yes! Just go!

18:03.896 --> 18:05.310
- Hey!

18:07.896 --> 18:09.862
Hey fool!

18:09.931 --> 18:13.620
Why you been duckin'’ me, man?

18:13.689 --> 18:16.448
- Hey, give me the mic.
Give me the mic right now.

18:16.517 --> 18:20.344
Hey, uh... whatcha'’
talkin'’ about, bruh?

18:20.413 --> 18:24.275
- You got your shot.
Now gimme mine.

18:24.344 --> 18:26.241
- Ooh!

18:26.310 --> 18:28.103
- Hey kid, just get outta here!

18:28.172 --> 18:29.689
- Y'’all see that?

18:29.758 --> 18:33.068
Soba Sportswear don'’t
wanna sponsor a kid like me,

18:33.137 --> 18:36.758
'’cuz I'’m not a puppet
like Triple G!

18:39.344 --> 18:42.275
- Hey! I'’m not a puppet!

18:42.344 --> 18:43.344
- Just ignore him.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.206
- See that?

18:45.275 --> 18:48.241
Triple G don'’t fight
no real man.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.551
He fights them set-ups.

18:54.724 --> 18:56.310
Hey, woman!

18:56.379 --> 19:00.000
Since Triple-G ain'’t
got no heart,

19:00.068 --> 19:04.758
maybe Soba Sportswear
should sponsor a real man!

19:07.793 --> 19:09.931
- All right man, you want me?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.344
You got me!

19:11.413 --> 19:13.724
Let'’s go, right here,
right now!

19:22.034 --> 19:23.413
- Okay...

19:23.482 --> 19:24.803
let the match go on
for about 30 seconds,

19:24.827 --> 19:26.310
and then bite off Hudson'’s ear.

19:26.379 --> 19:27.700
- Right.
Which ones'’s the fake ear?

19:27.724 --> 19:30.000
- Left.
- Left. Got it.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.493
- All right!
Looks we got another

19:33.517 --> 19:35.896
Backyard Beat Down.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.344
- Yay Trip!

19:38.413 --> 19:40.275
- Here we go!

19:40.344 --> 19:41.482
- Fight!

19:44.344 --> 19:46.275
- You'’re goin'’ down, son!

19:46.344 --> 19:48.793
Ooh.

19:48.862 --> 19:50.448
Face punch!

19:52.068 --> 19:54.344
How do you like that, sucka?

19:56.758 --> 19:58.517
- This blond kid
seems pretty good.

19:58.586 --> 19:59.965
- Nah, Trip'’ll be fine.

20:00.034 --> 20:01.965
Take your hand off
my shoulder, Dave.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.241
- Yup.

20:03.310 --> 20:05.586
- See?
You ain'’t so bad, Trip!

20:05.655 --> 20:07.310
You ain'’t so bad!

20:07.379 --> 20:09.896
- Quit trash talkin'’ me, man!

20:12.000 --> 20:13.620
- You'’re soft, man.

20:13.689 --> 20:17.241
Like a baby'’s neck.

20:20.482 --> 20:22.344
- Wrong ear! Wrong ear!
Wrong ear!

20:29.827 --> 20:32.724
- Oh my God, he bit off his ear!

20:32.793 --> 20:34.310
- Trip!

20:34.379 --> 20:35.689
- Yeah!

20:35.758 --> 20:37.758
That'’s right,
I bit his ear off!

20:37.827 --> 20:39.827
And I liked it!

20:39.896 --> 20:41.241
- Okay, that is it!

20:41.310 --> 20:43.827
Soba Sportswear
wants nothing to do

20:43.896 --> 20:47.344
with kids who bite
other kids'’ ears!

20:47.413 --> 20:49.965
Trip, you'’re fired!

20:50.034 --> 20:51.724
- Oh no!

20:53.275 --> 20:54.344
- It worked!

20:54.413 --> 20:55.896
I'’m free! It worked!

20:55.965 --> 20:57.448
- Trip!
- What?

20:57.517 --> 20:59.758
- You bit off the wrong ear!

20:59.827 --> 21:03.827
- I... I what?

21:14.724 --> 21:16.793
- How could you bite off
the wrong ear?

21:16.862 --> 21:19.379
- Look, it was dark
and crazy in that place!

21:19.448 --> 21:22.758
Sorry, I'’ve never bitten off
a dude'’s ear before!

21:22.827 --> 21:24.724
- Well take some lessons,
would ya?

21:24.793 --> 21:27.586
- Wh... lessons?
- Yeah!

21:27.655 --> 21:30.827
- And maybe you should
apologize to Hudson.

21:30.896 --> 21:33.413
- Ugh!

21:34.931 --> 21:37.379
Yo dawg...
I'’m sorry.

21:37.448 --> 21:40.517
- Ah, it'’s okay.

21:44.551 --> 21:45.931
- It'’s Dub.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.793
Hey, what'’s up?

21:47.862 --> 21:50.551
- Hey! Are you kids at
Peter Sinai Hospital?

21:50.620 --> 21:52.413
- Yeah.
- Cool.

21:52.482 --> 21:54.793
Bunny, set us down
there on the roof.

21:54.862 --> 21:56.172
- Okay, Dub.

21:56.241 --> 21:57.965
- Don'’t land on the roof!

21:58.034 --> 21:59.448
- This is a hospital.

21:59.517 --> 22:01.965
They need the helipad
for their own...

22:03.965 --> 22:06.172
- Bunny!

22:10.724 --> 22:12.034
- Woo!

22:23.344 --> 22:25.206
Whee!

22:32.413 --> 22:34.448
♪ Drop that

22:34.517 --> 22:35.517
- Mmm.
