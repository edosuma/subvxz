00:47.026 --> 00:50.123
# ...Sheds His grace on thee... #

00:52.115 --> 00:53.123
Hey, Dad.

00:53.241 --> 00:57.168
Man, "F" this wannabe holiday!

00:57.287 --> 00:58.295
What?

00:58.413 --> 01:00.465
The Fourth of July?
You hate the Fourth of July?

01:00.582 --> 01:02.135
- Yes.
- It's America's birthday!

01:02.250 --> 01:05.465
- You don't like birthdays?
- After the bottle-rocket smoke clears,

01:05.587 --> 01:09.727
day after tomorrow, all these
mouth-breathers are gonna be in my store

01:09.841 --> 01:13.981
buying half-off Christmas ornaments.
You know it and I know it.

01:14.095 --> 01:16.480
- I don't know if I know it.
- Oh?

01:16.598 --> 01:19.730
What are you looking at? Oh, wow!

01:19.851 --> 01:22.070
Fifty Shades of He-e-ey!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.239
Go talk to him!

01:24.355 --> 01:29.196
- No. He's... He's busy.
- He should be gettin' busy with you.

01:29.319 --> 01:32.284
I... I can't go over there. What if he...

01:32.405 --> 01:34.742
What if he slaps me?

01:34.866 --> 01:38.828
What? What if? What if instead of writing
the Declaration of Independence,

01:38.953 --> 01:42.133
George Washington wrote the
Declaration of Suffering in Silence

01:42.248 --> 01:43.802
with Your Raging Lady-boner?

01:43.917 --> 01:46.385
- Okay.
- What if instead of freeing the slaves,

01:46.503 --> 01:48.971
Abraham Lincoln said, "Ye shall not pass!"

01:49.088 --> 01:51.853
Okay, well, that's was Gandalf,
but I know where you're going.

01:51.966 --> 01:53.556
Go talk to him.

01:53.676 --> 01:57.473
I can't go over to that guy. He's like an
angel that's come down from outer space.

01:57.597 --> 02:00.397
Yeah, so ask him to probe you. Miaow!

02:00.517 --> 02:02.853
- I can't... I can't do it.
- Yes, you can!

02:02.977 --> 02:06.323
Look. Mister Pretty's off the phone.
Come on, do it.

02:06.439 --> 02:08.990
How many of those have you had?
You seem drunk.

02:09.108 --> 02:11.956
I'm drunk. Deb, I haven't had dinner.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.991
Deb! Deb! Deb!

02:14.113 --> 02:17.993
Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb!

02:18.117 --> 02:21.250
- Okay! Here goes nothing!
- Deb! Deb! Deb! Do it!

02:21.371 --> 02:23.542
Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb!

02:23.665 --> 02:25.551
- Oh, sorry.
- Deb...

02:25.667 --> 02:28.253
Deb, do it now. Go.

02:30.046 --> 02:31.600
See you.

02:32.924 --> 02:34.846
Oh, fuck me!

03:18.469 --> 03:20.309
What the...

03:21.806 --> 03:27.109
Well, I think... I noticed that
she had red hair and that's about it.

03:27.228 --> 03:29.447
Stacy and I had this fight,

03:29.564 --> 03:33.028
then this person and I started drinking

03:33.151 --> 03:35.832
and talking and drinking.

03:35.945 --> 03:38.282
And the rest is kind of a blur.

03:38.406 --> 03:40.826
No, now she's here. She's still here. Yeah.

03:40.950 --> 03:44.047
And I don't know how to get rid of her.

03:45.455 --> 03:48.420
No, I can't force her out.

03:50.502 --> 03:52.507
I'm not gonna pull the fire alarm.

03:52.629 --> 03:55.808
- White Russian and a whisky neat.
- Thanks, Billy.

03:55.924 --> 03:58.011
Oh, by gosh!

03:58.134 --> 04:00.353
You know my drink? Whoa!

04:00.470 --> 04:05.476
Well, here's to the long,
straight piece in Tetris. Clink!

04:07.185 --> 04:08.478
So, uh...

04:08.603 --> 04:10.275
I'm upset, too.

04:10.396 --> 04:13.196
...what are you doing in this gin joint?

04:13.316 --> 04:15.570
Let me talk some sense into him.

04:15.693 --> 04:20.617
Uh-huh. He looks drunk and ready to explain
himself. Yeah. We'll get back to you. Okay.

04:21.699 --> 04:26.588
Ryan, that was your dad. Please explain to me
why you told him to take that job and shove it?

04:26.704 --> 04:28.460
- No, I never said...
- He said you did.

04:28.581 --> 04:31.595
I told him I thought long and hard,
but I had to turn him down.

04:31.709 --> 04:35.221
- I was gonna tell you tonight.
- I am your fiancÃ©e, all right?

04:35.338 --> 04:38.517
You tell me before you make
any stupid decisions.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.765
And what exactly can we do for you, Fraggle?

04:41.886 --> 04:47.106
I... I'm sorry. This gentleman bought me
a drink and we were having a conservation.

04:47.225 --> 04:51.318
Are you drinking his White Russian?
I told you that was a girl's drink.

04:51.437 --> 04:53.573
This is your drink?

04:53.690 --> 04:55.446
Well, it was.

04:55.567 --> 05:00.573
I'm sorry. I drink them, too. I just thought
you were being amazingly intuitive.

05:00.697 --> 05:03.995
Oh, good for you, sweetie. Why don't you
just take it with our compliments, all right?

05:04.117 --> 05:07.214
- Billy! Another Russian and a Bird over here.
- Coming up.

05:07.328 --> 05:10.792
Ryan, you need to call your dad
right now. You can still get this job...

05:10.915 --> 05:13.003
Stacy, I'm not working
for my father's company.

05:13.126 --> 05:14.929
We have this all figured out!

05:15.044 --> 05:18.722
You and I are gonna get married, your dad
is gonna get old, we're gonna take over.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.889
What is going on with you? Are you
still into this "helping" people thing?

05:22.010 --> 05:26.020
I am done talking about this. Okay?
Like she said, we were having a conversation.

05:26.139 --> 05:28.476
Really? What's her name then?

05:28.600 --> 05:29.941
- Estelle.
- Deborah.

05:30.059 --> 05:33.108
What? You... you know my name?

05:33.229 --> 05:36.527
No, I... You looked like a Deborah,
so obviously I was wrong.

05:36.649 --> 05:39.579
No, my name is Deborah. You were right!

05:39.694 --> 05:42.198
I just said Estelle because I wanted
to get you out of the doghouse.

05:42.322 --> 05:44.825
- How would that have helped me?
- You know what?

05:44.949 --> 05:48.497
You two enjoy each other.
Happy Independence Day.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.874
- Because we're through.
- Stacy, this doesn't have to mean...

05:50.997 --> 05:54.509
Yes, it does, Ryan! This is a package deal.

05:54.626 --> 05:57.094
So you can say goodbye to these.

05:59.923 --> 06:01.975
Trixie and Mayberry.

06:03.676 --> 06:06.394
- I loved those cats.
- You'll see them again.

06:06.513 --> 06:08.933
She seems like a...

06:09.057 --> 06:10.978
sweet girl.

06:12.602 --> 06:15.105
Kev, come on, focus. Help me.

06:15.230 --> 06:17.947
That is a solid move. No, man!

06:18.066 --> 06:20.450
- I'm not gonna... Yeah, but that's your move.
- So?

06:20.568 --> 06:22.823
Not everybody can pull that off.

06:22.946 --> 06:26.374
Kev, you're breaking up
or something. Go back to...

06:26.491 --> 06:29.397
- Kev, are you there?
- Ryan!

06:42.549 --> 06:43.889
Excuse me?

06:44.008 --> 06:46.476
Mmmm!

06:46.594 --> 06:48.765
Mmm, morning!

06:48.888 --> 06:51.606
Uh! I slept in, didn't I?

06:51.724 --> 06:53.564
Yeah, you sure did.

06:53.685 --> 06:56.734
So, what's on the agend'? Brunch?

06:56.855 --> 06:58.065
Ah, no.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.286
Ooh! A black-coffee man. I like it.

07:01.401 --> 07:04.414
"I'm John Wayne, I don't need no breakfast."

07:04.529 --> 07:08.242
Ah, I actually already had my coffee, but...

07:08.366 --> 07:13.171
Anyway, it's the Fourth, so I'm gonna go
spend some time with my family.

07:13.288 --> 07:15.756
- And maybe you should, too, right?
- Oh, my God!

07:15.874 --> 07:19.468
Oh, God! I must look terrible,
but... so soon.

07:19.586 --> 07:21.757
But I... I guess I could meet your family.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.597
No, no, I actually meant your family.

07:24.716 --> 07:28.062
But either way, I have to go right now, so...

07:28.178 --> 07:31.772
Okay, well, just... do what
you gotta do, Mr Magoo.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.437
I've got a book and I'll just, uh...

07:35.560 --> 07:37.067
stay here.

07:37.187 --> 07:38.942
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

07:39.063 --> 07:41.151
Oh, um... Hey, uh, look,

07:41.274 --> 07:44.620
I don't exactly remember
what happened last night...

07:44.736 --> 07:48.283
Oh? Well, do you want
the slow-motion instant replay?

07:48.406 --> 07:50.292
Oh, great! Okay. Hey!

07:50.408 --> 07:51.749
- That's a...
- Oh, no!

07:51.868 --> 07:56.044
That was a family heirloom, but, uh,
you know what? Don't worry about it, please.

07:56.164 --> 07:57.552
Uh, please.

07:57.665 --> 07:59.635
Okay. Well, uh...

07:59.751 --> 08:01.507
As you wish.

08:01.628 --> 08:06.634
Um... Well, look, I think we can agree
that this was a mistake.

08:08.176 --> 08:10.477
Oh, yeah. Of course, a mistake!

08:10.595 --> 08:13.359
What? I'm glad you said it before I said it.

08:13.473 --> 08:18.228
Cos I was gonna say it. There's a load off!

08:18.353 --> 08:21.152
Great! Okay. So we can leave. Now.

08:21.272 --> 08:22.281
Now?

08:22.398 --> 08:24.285
Yes, now is... now is...

08:24.400 --> 08:26.868
is even, uh, too late for me.

08:26.986 --> 08:31.495
Like I wish we could go in a time machine
and go back five minutes, and then leave then.

08:31.616 --> 08:34.546
But we don't, we don't have that,
so we just have to walk. So here we go.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.332
Where's the DeLorean
when you need one, right?

08:36.453 --> 08:38.625
- Okay.
- Yeah! Hello!

08:38.748 --> 08:41.596
McFly? Anybody home?

08:41.708 --> 08:44.557
- Okay, there you go.
- Much obliged.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.843
So, you know, if we run into
each other around town,

08:49.968 --> 08:53.349
it doesn't need to be weird.
We can just say hello or wave...

08:53.471 --> 08:56.817
What a nice morning. It's...

08:56.933 --> 08:59.436
Holidays are so peaceful, don't you think?

08:59.561 --> 09:02.194
- I guess I never really...
- Listen, my children.

09:02.313 --> 09:06.157
And you will hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.

09:06.276 --> 09:09.906
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door.

09:10.029 --> 09:12.912
And a word that will echo forever more.

09:14.659 --> 09:16.913
Wow, that was actually nice.

09:17.036 --> 09:18.543
- Um...
- Thank you.

09:18.663 --> 09:20.585
- Have a good one.
- Oh...

09:20.707 --> 09:24.053
It's Longfellow.
He's from here. Portland, Maine.

09:24.169 --> 09:28.973
- Yeah, I know where we live.
- I used to recite it for my mom every Fourth.

09:30.049 --> 09:32.137
She's in a better place now.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.099
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:34.220 --> 09:38.361
Virginia Beach. They have
a lot of activities for seniors there.

09:38.474 --> 09:42.401
I try to go, but I'm so busy
with work at the TV station.

09:42.520 --> 09:46.151
Hence, alone for the holiday!

09:46.274 --> 09:47.781
Okay, well, uh...

09:47.901 --> 09:50.155
God bless... America!

09:50.278 --> 09:52.365
Hey, God bless you!

09:55.158 --> 09:57.210
Whoever you are.

10:05.376 --> 10:07.049
Deb, it's Rubes.

10:07.170 --> 10:12.343
Call me as soon as you drag yourself out
of that fine man's bed, you complete whore.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.887
Did you ever know that you're my hero...

10:15.011 --> 10:19.520
Great! Somebody's coming in the store and
they look drunk and I feel like ass today.

10:19.641 --> 10:22.820
Hey! You break it, you buy it, bucko!

10:22.936 --> 10:25.154
Shit! Aah!

10:33.404 --> 10:35.825
Happy holidays. You've reached Yule Mart.

10:35.949 --> 10:38.997
We'll be open July 4th until noon
and all day on the 5th.

10:39.118 --> 10:43.338
You'll love our frankincense
and myrrh-chandise! Get it?

10:43.873 --> 10:46.710
Hi, I don't know if I should be your hero.

10:46.835 --> 10:50.097
Homeboy didn't want to
see me again after last night.

10:50.213 --> 10:53.891
I guess, in the light of day,
I seemed like some sort of monster.

10:55.093 --> 10:57.679
Rubes, you gotta tell me
what happened last night,

10:57.804 --> 10:59.476
cos I don't remember bupkis.

10:59.597 --> 11:01.899
- Was I some sort of jackhole or something?
- Why won't she leave?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.401
Hello?

11:08.731 --> 11:10.783
Piece of kaka phone!

11:12.569 --> 11:14.040
Really?

11:14.153 --> 11:15.162
Uh!

11:46.477 --> 11:47.652
Hello?

11:51.149 --> 11:52.323
Joe?

11:54.777 --> 11:56.201
Anybody?

11:56.321 --> 11:58.041
Don't!

11:59.574 --> 12:01.211
Don't make me!

12:01.326 --> 12:03.746
The parade's really gone downhill this year.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.634
Come on! Get off!

12:08.917 --> 12:10.803
All right, Joe...

12:10.919 --> 12:13.932
I got a large Casco Bay blend here.

12:15.089 --> 12:16.347
Joe?

12:17.425 --> 12:18.932
All right.

12:19.677 --> 12:22.939
Oh, hey, man. There you are. What's going on?

12:24.015 --> 12:26.067
Dude, why are you eating a foot?

12:29.979 --> 12:30.988
Joe!

12:32.357 --> 12:33.656
Joe!

12:35.026 --> 12:37.446
Help! God!

12:39.176 --> 12:41.439
Oh, my God!

12:42.033 --> 12:44.584
What is that? This is horrible!

12:46.079 --> 12:47.087
Joe!

13:01.052 --> 13:02.938
Sorry, Joe.

13:22.115 --> 13:24.084
Come on, come on, come on!

13:24.200 --> 13:27.335
- No, wait, wait! My place, my place!
- Okay.

13:27.453 --> 13:28.673
What is this...

13:28.788 --> 13:32.798
Well, I've never seen one before, but it
seems, sort of, like a zombie apocalypse.

13:33.710 --> 13:36.213
Oh! You know, at least
they're not the sprinter type.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.971
They're more of the old-school,
cerebral palsy variety.

13:39.090 --> 13:42.305
Hey, that's Manny, from up the street.
He really does have CP.

13:42.427 --> 13:45.191
Oh, I'm sorry! I was just trying to...

13:45.305 --> 13:46.692
Whoa!

13:48.141 --> 13:49.778
Okay, some of them run!

13:51.811 --> 13:53.532
So sorry.

13:54.689 --> 13:56.824
- So what are we gonna do?
- I don't know!

13:56.941 --> 13:59.955
I don't have a whole lot of experience
with this type of thing!

14:00.069 --> 14:03.949
- Why are you taking off your shoes?
- Because it's filthy outside!

14:04.073 --> 14:07.458
Okay, okay, calm down.

14:08.307 --> 14:12.923
Okay. We need information. We need to
figure out if it's affecting everyone.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.093
Okay. TV.

14:16.961 --> 14:18.219
Okay.

14:18.338 --> 14:20.425
Where's CNN?

14:20.548 --> 14:22.518
I don't have it. I got rid of
cable a couple of months ago.

14:22.634 --> 14:26.514
Oh, that's cool. I have some friends
that did that and it sounded so liberating.

14:26.638 --> 14:29.272
Though not actually that helpful right now!

14:29.390 --> 14:31.442
I still get the local stuff.

14:32.685 --> 14:35.948
The annual event drew famished foodies
from Bangor to Brunswick

14:36.064 --> 14:38.318
to support the fire department's
annual pancake breakfast...

14:38.441 --> 14:40.197
Good! It hasn't spread across town.

14:40.318 --> 14:42.703
No, not necessarily.
This is yesterday's broadcast.

14:42.820 --> 14:45.585
Which you know because
you were running the camera.

14:45.698 --> 14:48.035
Are you being weirdly sarcastic
or how do you know that?

14:48.159 --> 14:50.579
You told me last night that
you work at the news station.

14:50.703 --> 14:55.093
- Now why would they rerun a news broadcast?
- That's what I don't understand.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.928
Radio! Do you have one?

14:57.043 --> 14:59.843
...Area and wait for help.
Repeat message 5-B.

14:59.963 --> 15:02.182
Couldn't we have taken
the radio out of the...

15:02.298 --> 15:04.553
- Stay in your homes with the doors locked.
- This is it!

15:04.676 --> 15:08.603
The Governor has declared a state of
emergency and alerted the National Guard.

15:08.721 --> 15:12.732
Symptoms of the ailment include
slurred speech, wild movement,

15:12.851 --> 15:16.991
an appetite for human flesh,
and both slow and fast walking.

15:17.105 --> 15:21.910
If loved ones display these traits, isolate
them in a secure area and wait for help.

15:22.026 --> 15:24.281
"Loved ones". I gotta call Stacy.

15:24.404 --> 15:26.623
- Repeat message 5-B.
- Wait!

15:26.739 --> 15:29.160
You guys broke up, right?

15:31.598 --> 15:36.091
- I think I left my phone at the coffeshop.
- You went to a coffeeshop?

15:36.207 --> 15:38.971
I thought that you already had your coffee?

15:39.085 --> 15:41.470
- That's very interesting.
- Can I use yours?

15:41.588 --> 15:45.301
Oh, boy! I think that I should
conserve battery power.

15:45.425 --> 15:46.718
Please.

15:46.843 --> 15:48.100
Oh!

15:48.219 --> 15:50.355
Okay. Make it snappy.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.607
Wait. Seriously, this is
what you use to call people?

15:52.724 --> 15:55.523
- Okay, listen, if you don't want to use it...
- No, no. It's fine.

15:55.643 --> 15:57.731
I just, uh...

15:57.854 --> 15:59.989
- Uh...
- You don't know her number?

16:00.106 --> 16:02.610
No! I... Ssh! All right? I'm trying to think.

16:02.734 --> 16:05.533
The prospects for your relationship
are not looking good.

16:05.653 --> 16:08.038
I always just use speed dial, all right?
Everybody does that.

16:08.156 --> 16:09.709
Listen, no one is judging you.

16:09.824 --> 16:13.170
I'm just saying that when I care about someone,
I commit their phone number to memory.

16:13.286 --> 16:14.876
Like my mom.

16:14.996 --> 16:19.293
Oh, shark, my mom!
Gimme-gimme-gimme-gimme-gimme!

16:26.007 --> 16:27.644
- Hello?
- Mom!

16:27.759 --> 16:30.891
- Are there zombies there?
- Gotcha! You've reached my voicemail.

16:31.012 --> 16:33.812
- Please leave a message.
- Jesus, Mom, I hate this gag.

16:33.932 --> 16:35.937
Just kidding, it's actually me.

16:36.059 --> 16:38.906
Oh, oh... Mom, are you really there?

16:39.020 --> 16:42.448
Well, of course, little Miss Magoo.
Happy Fourth of July!

16:42.565 --> 16:45.531
Uh, have you been outside yet today?

16:45.652 --> 16:47.573
Why, yes, I was just down
at the Pick 'n Save.

16:47.695 --> 16:49.747
And are there people
eating other people's flesh?

16:49.864 --> 16:51.704
I'm in Virginia Beach, honey, not Florida.

16:51.824 --> 16:55.621
Mom, listen to me. The people here
are infected with something.

16:55.745 --> 16:58.130
I'm trying to get down there,
but if I don't make it...

16:59.207 --> 17:01.010
- ...take care of yourself.
- Deb?

17:01.125 --> 17:02.679
- I love you.
- Are you there?

17:02.794 --> 17:04.799
- Ma?
- Can you hear me?

17:06.089 --> 17:09.265
- Still using that janky old phon...
- Dammit!

17:17.183 --> 17:18.441
Mm.

17:21.938 --> 17:25.681
Okay, let's take stock of
what we have and, uh...

17:27.569 --> 17:31.875
Board up the windows. Way ahead
of you, chief. Pee corner's over there.

17:31.990 --> 17:35.952
That end table was a matching set! And we
don't need a pee corner, I've got a bathr...

17:36.077 --> 17:38.708
You know what? We're getting out of here.

17:40.832 --> 17:43.382
Help me!

17:48.381 --> 17:51.264
All right, they're drawn to the noise.
We'll have to leave quietly.

17:51.384 --> 17:53.436
But... you heard the radio.

17:53.553 --> 17:57.065
They said to hunker down and wait for
the National Guard or, you know, whatever.

17:57.182 --> 17:59.436
And, just some food for thought,

17:59.559 --> 18:02.987
we might want to start bonding
in case we have to repopulate the world.

18:03.104 --> 18:06.486
- Just thinking out loud here.
- No, please don't, all right?

18:06.608 --> 18:10.321
Look, my fiancÃ©e, brother and father
are out there. They'll be expecting me.

18:10.445 --> 18:13.707
Breaking news... people are kind of
foregoing their holiday plans right now.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.460
You'll be no help to them
if you get infected.

18:15.575 --> 18:18.921
I'd rather take that risk than be
without the people I care about.

18:19.037 --> 18:22.964
- Okay, whatever you want. I'm staying put.
- But I need you!

18:25.460 --> 18:30.181
It's weird. I know that we've only known
each other a short time, but I kind of feel...

18:30.298 --> 18:32.766
- You have a car.
- Oh?

18:32.884 --> 18:35.684
What happened to yours, player?
It's in the shop?

18:35.803 --> 18:38.188
I don't have one.
I ride my bicycle everywhere.

18:38.306 --> 18:41.438
Everywhere except across town in
the middle of a zombie apocalypse, huh?

18:41.559 --> 18:43.529
- Is that your one exception?
- Look...

18:43.645 --> 18:46.325
Help me collect my people,
then we can all leave town together,

18:46.439 --> 18:49.120
and then you can get to your mom in Virginia.

18:49.234 --> 18:50.954
Oh, I can't stay mad at you!

18:52.237 --> 18:54.407
We're gonna need some road snacks.

18:54.531 --> 18:57.414
Oh! I foolishly thought
that you kept food in here.

18:57.534 --> 19:01.591
- Hey, we can survive on this stuff!
- Oh, for an hour, if we were rabbits.

19:01.704 --> 19:04.670
Why do you have coconut water?
Is this Maine or Gilligan's Island?

19:04.791 --> 19:07.259
It's very hydrating.

19:07.377 --> 19:10.971
Okay, once we get in that car,
I am not stopping till we get to VA.

19:11.089 --> 19:13.557
There's gotta be some place
around here that we can get food.

19:13.675 --> 19:17.732
I check in on Mrs Jones,
get her groceries once in a while.

19:17.846 --> 19:20.064
Oh, that's so sweet!

19:22.308 --> 19:23.898
Oh, no!

19:25.895 --> 19:27.781
Oh, my God! Is she...

19:30.233 --> 19:31.823
So sad!

19:31.943 --> 19:34.078
To die alone on the Fourth.

19:36.573 --> 19:38.245
Shadows are trailing.

19:38.366 --> 19:40.169
My heart is bewailing.

19:40.285 --> 19:42.586
And tolling within like a funeral bell.

19:43.788 --> 19:46.007
Rest in peace, Mrs Jones.

19:49.502 --> 19:51.472
What are you doing?

19:51.588 --> 19:54.684
Oh, I was just reciting some Longfellow.
I think it's nice to say...

19:54.799 --> 19:57.018
No, no. Why did you open her eyes?

19:57.135 --> 20:01.975
That's what you do when someone dies,
to let their soul rise up to heaven.

20:02.098 --> 20:05.361
What? No, no. You close their eyes.

20:05.476 --> 20:08.525
Uh, okay, trust me on this one!

20:08.646 --> 20:12.241
No. Trust me. Okay? Nobody does it that way.

20:12.358 --> 20:16.238
Uh, you're gonna feel pretty silly
when the internet's back up.

20:16.362 --> 20:20.669
Please! This was a sweet old lady,
all right? Don't be weird.

20:20.783 --> 20:22.586
Just leave her in peace.

20:22.702 --> 20:24.375
- I...
- Stop it!

20:24.495 --> 20:26.465
Ooh, taking control!

20:26.581 --> 20:30.128
Yeah, I dig it!
But I've gotta do right by her.

20:30.251 --> 20:32.470
Let your soul be free!

20:32.587 --> 20:35.552
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, you're being ridiculous!

20:35.673 --> 20:38.141
And let go of my wrist, you're hurting me.

20:38.259 --> 20:41.392
- I'm not touching your... Whoa!
- What is happening?

20:43.890 --> 20:46.738
- A little help here, chief!
- I'm working on it!

20:47.060 --> 20:48.903
Okay, I'm sorry, Mrs Jones.

20:49.020 --> 20:52.698
- I'm really sorry to do this to you.
- Forget the lamp, Martha Stewart!

20:52.815 --> 20:55.236
Okay! Okay, okay! Jump away!

20:55.360 --> 20:57.910
All right! Now, and...

20:58.029 --> 20:59.666
- Clear!
- What are you doing?

20:59.781 --> 21:02.249
What? Why isn't it working?
Deb, do something!

21:02.367 --> 21:05.084
Please don't struggle, Mrs Jones!

21:05.203 --> 21:07.089
Oh! She's old!

21:15.129 --> 21:17.182
- Yeah!
- All right!

21:18.842 --> 21:22.021
I mean, that was a terrible, actually,
cos she was my neighbour.

21:22.136 --> 21:25.066
But that's, uh... Let's get the food.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.671
These are the crappiest snacks.
Didn't this lady eat any solids?

21:39.195 --> 21:40.406
Whoa!

21:40.530 --> 21:43.116
At least they're three floors down.

21:44.617 --> 21:47.583
Aah! Fire escape! Fire escape!

21:54.043 --> 21:56.013
Wait! Slow down!

21:56.129 --> 21:58.430
What are you doing?
You should've left all that stuff!

21:58.548 --> 22:00.885
- Sorry. Fine!
- No, no, no, don't just...

22:01.009 --> 22:02.765
Sorry.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.060
Shit!

22:04.179 --> 22:06.266
Great! Now look what you made me do.

22:11.519 --> 22:13.939
Well, that's it. We're toast.

22:14.063 --> 22:16.531
It's stupid for us both to die.

22:18.359 --> 22:20.661
- I'm gonna give you a chance.
- What are you talking about?

22:20.778 --> 22:21.822
Ssh!

22:21.946 --> 22:24.165
Earn this. Huh?

22:27.076 --> 22:29.331
- Come on.
- When the moment is right,

22:29.454 --> 22:31.293
you grab your bike and go!

22:31.414 --> 22:33.336
Who wants a piece of this?

22:46.262 --> 22:48.564
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

22:48.681 --> 22:50.936
Why are you hitting yourself?

22:51.059 --> 22:53.278
Here, guys. I'm right here.

22:53.394 --> 22:55.400
Come on, you guys, get over here.

22:55.522 --> 22:57.906
Come on, you guys. I'm just right here.

22:58.024 --> 22:59.282
Hey!

23:06.157 --> 23:07.450
Whoa!

23:07.575 --> 23:08.749
Aah!

23:08.868 --> 23:11.917
That was awesome! You were awesome!

23:12.038 --> 23:13.960
I feel so alive!

23:14.082 --> 23:16.169
- Tell me you have your keys.
- Yes!

23:24.759 --> 23:28.390
You saved me, Ryan! You effing saved me!

23:28.513 --> 23:31.941
I think we can be pretty sure
that you like me.

23:32.058 --> 23:33.944
Good, God! Do you live in here?

23:34.060 --> 23:35.448
No!

23:37.522 --> 23:39.112
Not any more.

23:39.232 --> 23:41.284
Maybe there's something more
about this on the radio.

23:41.401 --> 23:43.904
Don't you ever touch a black man's radio!

23:44.028 --> 23:46.365
It's Chris Tucker, Rush Hour.

23:46.489 --> 23:48.743
Radio's busted. Tape player works, though.

23:48.867 --> 23:51.999
Oh, well, that's completely useless.

23:53.496 --> 23:55.003
Ten points!

23:55.123 --> 23:57.258
W-w-what are you doing?

23:57.375 --> 23:59.012
I know! Low hanging fruit, right?

24:00.295 --> 24:02.264
Aah! No, no! Stop that.

24:02.380 --> 24:05.844
Don't worry about it! This is like
swatting mosquitoes for little Otis.

24:05.967 --> 24:09.561
No, no! You can't just murder these zombies.
These are people.

24:09.679 --> 24:12.064
Um... maybe they were once.

24:12.182 --> 24:14.946
No. For all we know, some chemist
could be working on a cure right now.

24:15.059 --> 24:16.447
- They could be turned normal again.
- Sure!

24:16.561 --> 24:18.981
And maybe we can all hold hands
and skip to Yum-Yum Town,

24:19.105 --> 24:21.739
where rainbows shoot
out of the butts of unicorns.

24:21.858 --> 24:23.199
I'm serious.

24:24.319 --> 24:27.581
Ryan, even if you're right,
would they really want to come back?

24:27.697 --> 24:31.577
How would you deal with the fact that you
just ate your roommate's lower intestine?

24:31.701 --> 24:34.418
Okay, okay. I wasn't looking on that one.

24:34.537 --> 24:36.044
Please, Deb.

24:40.627 --> 24:42.762
Enjoy your life, zombies.

24:48.676 --> 24:51.891
I always knew this town was dead,
but this is ridiculous.

24:52.013 --> 24:53.686
Cha-cha-cha!

24:53.806 --> 24:55.609
How many miles does this boat get?

24:55.725 --> 24:57.944
Oh, you're gonna bust on my car now?

24:58.061 --> 25:01.525
No, no, I was just thinking about
when we need to fill up the gas again.

25:01.648 --> 25:05.871
No, no, I hear it in your voice.
"Otis is offensive. Otis is unclean."

25:05.985 --> 25:10.043
Do you know, like, what the emissions from
this car actually do to the environment?

25:10.156 --> 25:13.205
I'm sorry, I must have missed
that page in Ryan's Guide To Being

25:13.326 --> 25:15.627
- A Completely Perfect Humanoid.
- No, no!

25:15.745 --> 25:19.423
It's not about being perfect.
Clean energy is just the right thing to do.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.343
Energy is messy, okay.

25:21.459 --> 25:26.098
I mean, it's really cute to eat organic millet
and drive around in a hovercraft or whatever,

25:26.214 --> 25:28.219
but look around you, dude.

25:28.341 --> 25:31.723
We lost. We tried to save the planet
and this is where it got us.

25:31.845 --> 25:34.977
- God, you sound just like my dad.
- Really?

25:35.098 --> 25:37.518
The guy sounds awesome.
What are you, adopted?

25:37.642 --> 25:42.482
That's good. Nice one. That's actually the
family joke. My brother makes it all the time.

25:43.544 --> 25:49.723
It's a good one. Look, I'm sorry.
My family is not a Hallmark card either.

25:51.406 --> 25:53.577
I remember every Fourth,

25:53.700 --> 25:57.757
my dad would bring us all up to the roof
to watch fireworks over the eastern prom.

25:57.871 --> 26:02.841
And then, one year, around dusk,
the guy's nowhere to be found.

26:02.959 --> 26:07.016
So we go up to the roof
and that's when we saw him.

26:08.965 --> 26:12.180
He was lying there in the backyard,

26:12.302 --> 26:14.888
right by the barbecue.

26:15.013 --> 26:17.065
He almost looked like he was asleep.

26:19.517 --> 26:23.777
He was changing out the propane tank.
It was the best cookout ever.

26:26.316 --> 26:28.403
- That's the end of the story?
- Mm-hm.

26:28.526 --> 26:31.243
That's a ridiculous... That was so strange.

26:31.362 --> 26:33.699
- It's all going one direction and then...
- But that was a good memory.

26:33.823 --> 26:35.875
It's not all like that.

26:35.992 --> 26:37.914
It's a mixed bag.

26:38.036 --> 26:40.372
Okay, well, anyway, um...

26:41.456 --> 26:44.884
My dad is pissed because
I won't work for the family business.

26:45.001 --> 26:46.555
Really? What's wrong with it?

26:46.669 --> 26:50.596
It's rated the most environmentally
unsound business in the state.

26:50.715 --> 26:53.396
Waverly Water Treatment?

26:53.510 --> 26:55.930
You're a Waverly? Oh, my God!

26:56.054 --> 26:59.186
- How did you put that together?
- Because I work in the news, remember?

26:59.307 --> 27:03.816
Don't get me wrong, that company seems like
pure evil but the buckage must be pretty good.

27:03.937 --> 27:07.899
Yeah, well, not for me. I'm not gonna
work there, so my brother's gonna get it all.

27:08.024 --> 27:10.159
Mm, tough break.

27:10.276 --> 27:12.613
Where the fuck are we?

27:13.947 --> 27:15.749
Wait. What are you doing?

27:15.865 --> 27:18.001
Just gotta stop in here.

27:21.955 --> 27:24.885
Yule Mart? No, no, we agreed.

27:24.999 --> 27:27.680
No more stopping. My dad's place
is just a couple of miles up the road.

27:27.794 --> 27:31.970
Yeah, and we're gonna get there. But my
friend's inside. I have to see if she's okay.

27:32.090 --> 27:34.177
Fine. Five minutes.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.720
Do we have anything deadlier
than a bike chain?

27:37.804 --> 27:38.896
Uh...

27:39.013 --> 27:40.686
This... thing.

27:40.807 --> 27:41.851
No.

27:41.975 --> 27:44.194
Oh, check the glove box.

27:48.398 --> 27:50.319
Maybe that?

27:53.194 --> 27:56.540
You've had a gun this entire time?

27:56.656 --> 27:59.753
Yeah, it was in there when I bought the car.

27:59.868 --> 28:03.082
It's mostly for show, though,
it only has two bullets.

28:03.204 --> 28:06.004
If it comes down to it,
we'll use it to tap out.

28:06.124 --> 28:08.259
- "Tap out"?
- Yeah.

28:08.376 --> 28:10.713
You know, if we get infected.

28:10.837 --> 28:12.759
Tap. Poof!

28:12.881 --> 28:15.182
And then tap. Poof!

28:15.300 --> 28:17.601
You just shot yourself first.

28:17.719 --> 28:21.480
Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan! I haven't worked out
the math on our murder-suicide yet!

28:21.598 --> 28:23.816
Okay, let me be really clear about this.

28:23.933 --> 28:26.104
I do not want to be tapped out.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.991
Right, you say that now!

28:29.105 --> 28:33.067
No, seriously, if I get infected, just let me
run off into the woods or something.

28:33.193 --> 28:36.491
You'll feel differently when you get
infected. I don't want you to suffer.

28:36.613 --> 28:40.290
No, I could not be more sure about this.
I do not want you to shoot me in the head.

28:40.408 --> 28:43.125
Sure, sure, sure. Okay, okay.
We'll see, though.

28:43.244 --> 28:44.336
Okay?

28:50.168 --> 28:51.758
Stay alert.

28:54.881 --> 28:57.680
# Jingle bells, jingle bells...

28:58.510 --> 29:01.274
# Oh, what fun it is to ride... #

29:12.398 --> 29:14.119
# Deck the halls with... #

29:17.695 --> 29:20.828
- Look at all this crap.
- You don't like Christmas?

29:20.949 --> 29:23.832
Are you kidding, me?
I freakin' love Christmas.

29:23.952 --> 29:27.629
Which is why I think these plastic trees
are for Tyre stores and...

29:27.747 --> 29:29.669
communists.

29:29.791 --> 29:33.718
When I have kids, I'm gonna take them
every year to cut down a real tree.

29:33.837 --> 29:36.802
You realise it takes ten years
for one of those trees to grow

29:36.923 --> 29:38.679
and only seconds to saw the life out of it?

29:38.800 --> 29:41.481
If there's a bigger buzz-kill than you, sir,
I do not know what that looks like.

29:41.594 --> 29:44.892
I'm just saying that we should celebrate
planting a tree with the children,

29:45.014 --> 29:46.568
rather than destroying one.

29:46.683 --> 29:48.071
"We"?

29:48.184 --> 29:50.735
- Yeah, you know. I mean, people, Earth.
- A-huh.

29:50.854 --> 29:52.360
But you said "the children".

29:52.480 --> 29:54.485
If you meant children in general,
you would've said something like...

29:54.607 --> 29:56.328
Oh, my God!

29:56.442 --> 29:58.448
That sweater!

30:01.322 --> 30:02.746
Ruby?

30:02.866 --> 30:05.250
Honey, are you okay?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.876
Look out!

30:12.667 --> 30:15.004
Well, it looks like she's
full-on zombie, let's jet.

30:15.128 --> 30:18.615
- Wait! We can't leave her like that.
- What do you suggest?

30:19.257 --> 30:22.894
- Tap, tap.
- Use our bullets on her?

30:23.011 --> 30:25.894
It's the right thing to do. Besides,
you said you don't want to use them.

30:26.014 --> 30:27.307
But the gun's in the car.

30:31.102 --> 30:32.490
Here.

30:32.604 --> 30:34.656
You distract her and lead her outside.

30:34.772 --> 30:36.445
I'll do the rest.

30:39.152 --> 30:40.326
Hey!

30:40.445 --> 30:42.913
Sale on flesh over here!

30:44.574 --> 30:45.867
Ruby?

30:51.414 --> 30:52.506
Deb!

30:53.583 --> 30:56.881
- What's going on?
- Get on the roof! Trust me!

30:57.003 --> 30:59.055
I don't trust you!

31:07.847 --> 31:09.520
Yahtzee!

31:12.143 --> 31:14.647
Did I hurt you in a past life or something?

31:14.771 --> 31:18.199
I just thought maybe you're right.
Maybe they'll find a cure for this some day.

31:18.316 --> 31:19.988
- Well, if I can change one mind.
- Hey...

31:20.109 --> 31:23.452
You saved a zombie, kid,
you didn't undo apartheid.

31:24.989 --> 31:27.493
Okay, let's go find your peeps.

31:27.617 --> 31:29.587
Hang in there, Rubs.

31:29.702 --> 31:31.754
It's up here on the right.

31:34.874 --> 31:37.888
Good. That's Stacy's car.
I'm glad she knew to come here.

31:38.002 --> 31:41.466
Yay! So glad Stacy isn't dead.

31:41.589 --> 31:44.852
Look, Deb, I hope this isn't going to...

31:44.968 --> 31:46.605
Are you out of your mind?

31:46.719 --> 31:49.021
What? We both agreed we're
not going to leave this car again.

31:49.138 --> 31:52.602
Until we get here, yeah! Obviously,
we have to get out to collect them.

31:52.725 --> 31:55.490
- We don't even know if they're in there.
- Trust me, they are.

31:55.603 --> 31:58.617
We always get together on the Fourth.
It's my dad's favourite holiday.

31:58.731 --> 32:01.745
Well, prepare yourself.
They may not be the people you remember.

32:01.860 --> 32:05.490
Oh, I have no doubt they'll be
unrelenting flesh-eating monsters,

32:05.613 --> 32:08.579
but I bet they won't be zombies. Okay.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.797
I deserve the things I want.
My needs are worthwhile.

32:11.911 --> 32:15.008
I'm not hurting anyone by being myself.

32:15.123 --> 32:17.709
What are you doing, Rain Man?

32:17.834 --> 32:21.630
I like to take a second to centre
myself every time I come here.

32:21.754 --> 32:25.812
I deserve the things I want.
My needs are worthwhile.

32:25.925 --> 32:29.140
- I'm not hurting anyone by being myself.
- Uh, uh... I want to be supportive, an' all,

32:29.262 --> 32:31.812
but is this mantra much longer?

32:37.677 --> 32:41.408
- Oh, man! What is it again?
- Well, why don't you try Stacy's phone number.

32:41.524 --> 32:46.199
Will you just give it a rest, all right?
You're like the Terminator of sarcasm.

32:46.321 --> 32:49.251
I drove you here, in my car,

32:49.365 --> 32:53.755
and you've been treating me like I'm just a bag
of wet diapers that you have to lug around.

32:53.870 --> 32:57.298
Well, that actually sounds less shitty
than whatever we've got going on now.

32:57.415 --> 33:01.638
Oh, wow! You know, I thought that
you were a cool guy back at the bar,

33:01.753 --> 33:04.766
but now I find out you're
some spoiled pretty boy.

33:04.881 --> 33:09.104
Excuse me, "pretty boy"? I have
a very masculine set of features, okay?

33:09.219 --> 33:11.520
If anything, my look is "burnished rugged".

33:11.638 --> 33:13.477
Nobody who is that says that!

33:13.598 --> 33:16.232
- I do.
- Your hair has not moved this entire time!

33:16.351 --> 33:19.031
It's thick, it requires maintenance.
You have no idea!

33:19.145 --> 33:22.242
You haven't taken a shower since
yesterday and yet you still smell

33:22.357 --> 33:24.077
like sandalwood and lilac!

33:24.192 --> 33:29.365
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to distract you
from being the weirdest person in the world!

33:32.200 --> 33:34.174
God, Chaz!

33:34.278 --> 33:36.375
- Did you change the gate code?
- Depends.

33:36.496 --> 33:41.336
- How do I know you're not... one of them?
- Because I'm speaking in words.

33:42.627 --> 33:44.679
- What about her?
- Gimme a break, Chaz!

33:44.796 --> 33:47.133
Hi, I'm Deb.

33:48.925 --> 33:51.725
- Will you knock it off?
- You're Ryan's big brother?

33:51.845 --> 33:54.728
- You're so... different.
- Thanks. We think he's adopted.

33:54.848 --> 33:56.105
Oh, that never gets old.

33:56.224 --> 33:59.072
Can we please come in?
We've had really a long day.

33:59.185 --> 34:02.732
So, wait, excuse me, wait.
What are you? Are you the rebound?

34:02.856 --> 34:04.825
Oh, busted!

34:04.941 --> 34:08.405
How did you know, dude?
You're probably an uncle now.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.875
- No! No, no, that's not...
- I knew it!

34:11.989 --> 34:13.829
- Stacy's here, right?
- Oh!

34:13.949 --> 34:16.998
She told me all about your big breakup, stud.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.089
Looks like you didn't waste
much time moving on now, did you?

34:19.205 --> 34:21.755
No, that's not...
We're just helping each other.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.714
I'm sure you are. Huh!

34:24.918 --> 34:27.553
Deb, I'm Chaz.

34:27.672 --> 34:31.226
Clearly the more masculine
of the two Waverly brothers.

34:32.243 --> 34:34.478
- Good shot.
- I aim to please.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.942
Okay! Open the gate!

34:38.056 --> 34:40.193
- You need the code, man.
- Okay.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.065
- Do you want it?
- Yes!

34:42.187 --> 34:45.900
Okay, it's five, eight, zero, zero eight.

34:46.024 --> 34:48.195
That's... It's "BOOBS" upside down.

34:48.318 --> 34:50.489
- Wow!
- Yeah.

34:50.612 --> 34:53.245
A gentleman, too! Ooh-Ia-Ia!

34:53.364 --> 34:56.056
Thank you, Chaz.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.835
Oh! Shoot!

35:03.291 --> 35:04.584
Dad?

35:04.709 --> 35:08.422
Whoa! This is, like,
straight out of Mitchell Black!

35:08.546 --> 35:11.560
Ryan! Oh, my Rye-bread, you're all right.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.308
- We thought for sure...
- No, no, I'm... I'm okay.

35:14.427 --> 35:17.310
Hey, Stacy, did you meet Deb?
She came here with Ryan, together.

35:17.430 --> 35:21.606
- Where did you creep up from?
- Oh, I just... came with Rye-bread.

35:21.726 --> 35:23.612
They helped each other get across town.

35:23.728 --> 35:25.899
God knows what they had to do
to survive. Isn't that swell?

35:26.022 --> 35:27.825
So helpful.

35:27.941 --> 35:30.112
- Do we tip her or...
- It was nothing.

35:30.235 --> 35:35.585
It was just one hand stroking the other.
Friends with benefits, as they say.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.252
- I'm glad you made it.
- Oh!

35:37.367 --> 35:39.039
Dad! Dad, look...

35:39.160 --> 35:42.506
I've been thinking, I'm really sorry for
what I said on the phone last night.

35:42.622 --> 35:44.461
I've been thinking all day and I was worried

35:44.582 --> 35:46.587
those would be the last words
we ever said to each other.

35:46.709 --> 35:50.932
Could I see you in the kitchen for a moment?
I need a little help with my brownies.

35:51.047 --> 35:53.135
Mr Waverly? Hi.

35:53.258 --> 35:54.385
Hi.

35:58.429 --> 36:00.814
I always help him with the brownies.

36:01.850 --> 36:04.697
- Hey, Deb, how much you bench?
- Right now?

36:04.811 --> 36:07.065
- Yeah.
- Forty?

36:07.188 --> 36:09.276
How could you be so boneheaded?

36:09.399 --> 36:12.578
- Stacy's here. She's not family.
- Stacy's inner circle.

36:12.694 --> 36:14.865
She's been here since last night,
for God's sake.

36:14.988 --> 36:16.708
- She has?
- The point is,

36:16.823 --> 36:18.543
I spoke with the Governor on the shortwave.

36:18.658 --> 36:22.834
He's arranged a chopper evac at
the county line at 0900 hours tomorrow.

36:22.954 --> 36:27.130
- For the four of us, not five.
- I'm sure Deb can squeeze in.

36:27.250 --> 36:31.177
Oh! You're a big man
now all of a sudden, huh?

36:31.296 --> 36:34.060
Why did I not get the memo?

36:34.174 --> 36:36.510
Well, this is bigger than you are, smart guy!

36:36.634 --> 36:38.722
And you'd know that if you'd
listened on the phone last night,

36:38.845 --> 36:41.016
instead of blathering on
about your principles.

36:41.139 --> 36:46.228
Wait, so you knew last night that
people were gonna turn into zombies?

36:46.352 --> 36:49.033
No, no, no, no.

36:49.147 --> 36:51.946
These people aren't... what you said.

36:52.066 --> 36:54.570
They're just ordinary citizens,

36:54.694 --> 36:57.375
who happen to have contracted

36:57.488 --> 37:01.546
a parasite-borne virus that makes
their corporal bodies decompose

37:01.659 --> 37:03.961
and gives them an insatiable
appetite for human flesh.

37:04.078 --> 37:07.377
Oh, my God! The water.

37:07.498 --> 37:11.461
Now, Ryan, come on,
it's just a very complicated situation.

37:11.586 --> 37:14.434
All right? We haven't got our arms
around all the details yet.

37:14.547 --> 37:16.635
Well, get your arms around this,
Deb's coming with us!

37:16.758 --> 37:20.104
- That's not an option.
- If you leave her out, I go too.

37:20.220 --> 37:23.897
I promised her I would get her out of town
and I'm keeping that promise.

37:32.273 --> 37:33.531
Mm!

37:34.943 --> 37:38.039
- You can't talk, Stacy, while I'm shooting.
- I didn't.

37:38.154 --> 37:41.618
So you're saying people became zombies
last night if they drank the city water?

37:41.741 --> 37:44.209
Or bathed in it,
which explains how you were spared.

37:44.327 --> 37:46.664
Stacy, Deb is my guest. Please!

37:46.788 --> 37:51.545
I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just going by
the look of her hair and face and clothes.

37:51.668 --> 37:56.591
But, Ryan, you take a shower, like,
every ten minutes. Why didn't you turn?

37:56.714 --> 37:58.186
Unless...

37:58.299 --> 38:00.435
I think I'm gonna be sick.

38:00.552 --> 38:02.023
Hi-ooh!

38:02.136 --> 38:06.313
- Longest walk of shame ever!
- No, no! That's not...

38:06.432 --> 38:08.651
Nothing happened, we both just passed out.

38:08.768 --> 38:12.280
- I mean, something happened.
- I'm sure it did!

38:12.397 --> 38:17.534
While you two were getting gross with each
other, I took care of Stacy and her pussy cats.

38:17.652 --> 38:18.826
Ryan...

38:20.029 --> 38:22.959
You were right and I was wrong.

38:23.074 --> 38:26.503
I have decided to keep the nutmeg in.

38:26.619 --> 38:30.131
- Oh, I'm glad you see it that way.
- Mm-hm.

38:30.248 --> 38:35.172
Nutmeg can be a bit much at times,
but that's no reason to abandon it.

38:35.295 --> 38:38.509
You guys are what, trading recipes now?
And when did that start happening?

38:38.631 --> 38:40.719
Chaz, will you just give
your ears a rest, please?

38:40.842 --> 38:43.974
- Okay, yeah.
- The important thing is, we're safe.

38:44.095 --> 38:46.396
We're all safe!

38:46.514 --> 38:49.480
Oh! Holy frijoles!

38:49.601 --> 38:50.894
Oh, man!

38:51.019 --> 38:55.408
Topper? You still have that
giant boozehound on the payroll?

38:55.523 --> 38:56.650
Hi, Ryan.

38:56.774 --> 39:01.579
That giant boozehound saved your privileged
little ass numerous times when you were a boy.

39:01.696 --> 39:04.709
Topper, just keep walking the
perimeter or no brownie for you.

39:04.824 --> 39:07.707
Yeah, like when Leah Schiffer
discovered me at hide-and-seek

39:07.827 --> 39:10.710
and got put in the hospital?
She didn't walk right ever again.

39:10.830 --> 39:15.172
Leah didn't play by the rules.
Society crumbles without rules.

39:15.293 --> 39:17.713
- Amen, Pop.
- And speaking of crumbling...

39:17.837 --> 39:20.803
I'm pretty sure my brownies
must be cool enough by now.

39:20.924 --> 39:23.392
Shall we all adjourn to the living room?

39:23.510 --> 39:25.764
Leah Schiffer!

39:25.887 --> 39:29.767
Easy does it there. Mmm!

39:29.891 --> 39:32.856
Will you look at that, huh?

39:32.977 --> 39:34.021
Sorry, I...

39:34.145 --> 39:36.649
I'm still stuck on this water thing.

39:36.773 --> 39:39.952
It's boring stuff, dear,
a little bit too technical.

39:40.068 --> 39:44.789
Does it have to do with the ultraviolet treatment
process that you're testing at Waverly Water?

39:44.906 --> 39:48.500
What? No. Not according to public record.

39:48.618 --> 39:51.583
Where did you ever hear
such a preposterous fabrication?

39:52.956 --> 39:55.927
I keep my ear to the ground for my job.

39:56.042 --> 39:58.593
Deb Clarington, News Channel Seven.

39:58.711 --> 40:03.717
Your system is supposed to cut the cost
of purifying our water by half, right?

40:03.842 --> 40:07.021
That's... brilliant and ambitious.

40:07.136 --> 40:10.185
Well, yes, it was supposed to be
a boon for the entire town.

40:10.306 --> 40:13.272
And we could sell the surplus
to the bottling companies.

40:13.393 --> 40:17.616
But weren't you supposed
to still be in beta on the process?

40:17.730 --> 40:18.822
We... we were.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.870
Then... why the rush, Frank?

40:21.985 --> 40:25.247
I told the Governor that we needed more time,

40:25.363 --> 40:29.160
that the pre-filters weren't
catching all of the bio-pathogens yet.

40:29.284 --> 40:33.127
But he... he insisted that we
roll it out before the holidays,

40:33.246 --> 40:35.714
so he could squeeze it into the Q2 budget.

40:35.832 --> 40:38.466
And by "insisted," I'm sure you
mean he gave you a huge kickback.

40:38.585 --> 40:42.642
How were we supposed to know it was going
to be a banner year for the Ichabod virus?

40:42.755 --> 40:46.101
The same thing that wiped out
the indigenous Wabanaki Indians?

40:46.217 --> 40:49.396
- Wobanaki Indians, Pop.
- Wobanaki Indians.

40:49.512 --> 40:53.605
I'm supposed to be proud of you that you
wiped out the entire population of our town?

40:53.725 --> 40:55.481
You see that? You always go to the negative.

40:55.602 --> 40:56.776
- I'm proud of you. Pop.
- Always!

40:56.895 --> 40:58.401
Population or no population.

40:58.521 --> 41:02.946
Oh, come on, relax now, babe.
We've got some catching up to do! Hm-hm!

41:03.067 --> 41:06.531
Okay. Well, jeez, it's been a hoot.

41:06.654 --> 41:10.000
- But I think I need to skedaddle down the road.
- No, Deb, wait!

41:10.116 --> 41:13.829
- Why, right?
- You can't go back out there.

41:13.953 --> 41:16.801
My dad arranged a helicopter
for us in the morning.

41:16.915 --> 41:19.963
Plus, you must be exhausted.
We hardly slept last night.

41:20.084 --> 41:24.011
You know those times when you can taste
your own stomach acid? I have that right now.

41:24.130 --> 41:28.520
- I know what you mean.
- I'm going to be just fine, chief.

41:28.635 --> 41:33.391
This was the deal. We got you here,
now I'm going to get on to my own family.

41:33.515 --> 41:36.813
So... thanks for the mammaries.

41:39.479 --> 41:42.134
Nobody's going anywhere!

41:42.815 --> 41:45.864
Till they taste one of my freedom brownies!

41:46.507 --> 41:49.119
- Chaz. Give this to Topper.
- I got it, Pop.

41:49.239 --> 41:51.244
For close-range kills.

41:54.515 --> 41:56.088
Stay.

41:56.204 --> 42:02.219
The brownies are a Fourth of July tradition
that we started when Ryan's mother was alive.

42:02.335 --> 42:06.132
- You remind me of her, in a way.
- I think we did that, like, twice.

42:06.256 --> 42:09.684
- If it means that much to you, of course.
- Yes.

42:11.594 --> 42:12.603
Oh!

42:12.720 --> 42:14.013
Mm?

42:15.181 --> 42:17.505
Gosh! That is...

42:18.142 --> 42:19.982
...so good.

42:20.103 --> 42:23.068
I'm surprised Chaz hasn't added
creatine to his brownie yet.

42:23.189 --> 42:25.775
Hey! I'm just trying
to stay strong for all of us.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.163
What are you gonna do when
the shit hits the fan? Huh, little brother?

42:29.279 --> 42:31.782
Are you going to come out with your
hair-dryer, is that what you're gonna do?

42:31.906 --> 42:34.077
- Huh, little brother?
- Whoa!

42:34.200 --> 42:35.754
- Stop it!
- Hey, hey!

42:35.869 --> 42:38.289
Stop it! Get off me!

42:38.413 --> 42:40.382
Get off me!

42:40.498 --> 42:42.717
You guys are acting worse
than those things out there.

42:42.834 --> 42:45.799
Oh, I thought they were just ordinary
citizens who got a little wet.

42:45.920 --> 42:49.633
- Oh, shut up, you little piss-ant.
- Pop, I got it!

42:49.757 --> 42:51.679
Come on, you numbskulls, you idiots!

42:51.801 --> 42:54.435
- If your mother... Stop it!
- I got him!

42:54.554 --> 42:56.144
- I can't get up!
- I got him!

42:56.264 --> 42:59.396
- He's trapped!
- Through the night rode Paul Revere.

42:59.517 --> 43:03.361
And so through the night
went his cry of alarm.

43:03.479 --> 43:06.943
Through every Middlesex village and farm

43:07.066 --> 43:09.368
a cry of defiance

43:09.485 --> 43:11.573
and not of fear.

43:11.696 --> 43:15.919
- What the bejeezus was that?
- That was Longfellow. Deb's favourite.

43:16.034 --> 43:19.711
Ah, Longfellow. You know,
he's from here. Maine. Portland.

43:19.829 --> 43:23.673
You know, maybe it's not my place, but...

43:23.791 --> 43:26.128
you guys are with family.

43:26.252 --> 43:28.507
We're lucky we're even alive.

43:28.630 --> 43:30.765
You see that, boys?

43:30.882 --> 43:35.188
The little redhead's right.
It's the Fourth of July, for God's sake.

43:35.303 --> 43:37.308
You're right. Yeah.

43:37.430 --> 43:39.518
Let's blow some shit up. Yeah?

43:39.641 --> 43:41.313
Yeah?

43:44.896 --> 43:46.319
Wait for it.

43:46.439 --> 43:48.160
- Wait for it.
- Yeah.

43:48.274 --> 43:50.611
- Here comes the good part. There it is.
- Oh, wow!

43:50.735 --> 43:52.657
Check that out!

43:52.779 --> 43:54.072
- That's great.
- Sweet!

43:54.197 --> 43:58.289
Up next, I got a big aerial display. It explodes
and then a roaring bear face comes out.

43:58.409 --> 44:01.838
No, no, no. That's enough.
We don't want to attract too much attention.

44:01.955 --> 44:04.505
What? Dad, I got, like, all these M80's.

44:04.624 --> 44:08.136
- You don't want to see the bear face?
- No! No, I do not.

44:08.878 --> 44:10.673
I shouldn't let you do this one.

44:10.797 --> 44:14.593
Okay, everybody, drink up. I'm gonna turn in.

44:14.717 --> 44:17.850
We have to have our wits
about us in the morning, so...

44:17.971 --> 44:19.561
- Ooh, quick question.
- Yeah.

44:19.681 --> 44:21.732
Where's everybody sleeping?

44:22.725 --> 44:26.320
Well, Ryan and Stacy
will stay in Ryan's old room,

44:26.437 --> 44:30.495
and Deborah over there...
How you doing there, hon?

44:30.608 --> 44:32.863
- I'm fine.
- Okay!

44:32.986 --> 44:35.121
She's going to be in your room, all right?

44:35.238 --> 44:38.168
And you're going to stand watch with Topper.

44:38.283 --> 44:40.252
- Come on, walk with me.
- Hm!

44:40.368 --> 44:42.622
- Walk with me, Chaz. Come!
- Hm!

44:45.206 --> 44:46.796
Come on.

44:48.084 --> 44:51.347
- I'm so glad that you're safe, babe.
- Yeah.

44:51.462 --> 44:52.934
Thanks.

44:59.971 --> 45:02.522
I'm gonna need your help
with Ryan in the morning.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.069
- How do you mean?
- His new friend isn't coming with us.

45:06.186 --> 45:09.069
- The adorable little ginger girl?
- I'm sure he'll throw a hissy fit.

45:09.189 --> 45:11.241
How are we gonna sneak out without her?

45:11.357 --> 45:15.664
I put enough horse tranquilizer in that
brownie to kept her asleep through August.

45:15.778 --> 45:18.199
I'm surprised she's even still on her feet!

45:18.323 --> 45:21.206
I'm sure she'll be going down
for the count soon.

45:22.619 --> 45:25.253
Hey, don't go soft on me now, boy!

45:25.371 --> 45:29.547
She works for the news. We don't want her
doing some story on the water supply.

45:29.667 --> 45:30.841
Uh-uh.

45:30.960 --> 45:35.469
Sometimes... you gotta put
your own oxygen mask on first.

45:37.300 --> 45:39.305
Put my oxygen mask on first.

45:39.427 --> 45:40.898
- Right, first.
- Ow!

45:41.012 --> 45:42.649
All right.

45:43.723 --> 45:45.645
- Uh, Chaz...
- Yeah, Pop.

45:45.767 --> 45:47.320
Stop trying to bang Stacy.

45:47.435 --> 45:51.066
- Once was enough.
- If only it was!

45:51.189 --> 45:54.535
Oh! Don't you tell me
you're falling in love with her?

45:54.651 --> 45:57.616
Ryan's back. Be realistic.

45:57.737 --> 46:02.412
What? Is it totally unrealistic to think
that I could be the special one for once?

46:02.534 --> 46:06.045
I mean, what's he got that I don't got?
Besides your great eyes.

46:06.162 --> 46:08.214
- We gotta stay focused, boy.
- A-ha.

46:08.331 --> 46:09.754
- You hear me? Stay focused.
- Okay!

46:09.874 --> 46:12.175
We got to keep our shit straight
if we're gonna make it through this thing.

46:12.293 --> 46:14.215
- Yeah, keep our shit straight.
- Keep it straight.

46:14.337 --> 46:16.556
Keep it straight. Thanks, Pop!

46:16.673 --> 46:18.345
- Thanks for the rap.
- Okay.

46:19.843 --> 46:20.851
Okay.

46:20.969 --> 46:24.231
Okay! All right, you'd better
get back to your post.

46:24.347 --> 46:25.474
Okay.

46:41.739 --> 46:45.452
"Portland's water runs through him."
Oh! Gross!

46:49.956 --> 46:52.424
I think you can forgo your sit-ups tonight.

46:55.086 --> 46:57.138
I'll give you a workout.

46:57.255 --> 46:58.548
Wow!

46:58.673 --> 47:00.429
Uh, Stacy...

47:00.550 --> 47:02.887
I'm talking about sex.

47:03.011 --> 47:05.146
No, I know. Um...

47:05.263 --> 47:07.944
I'm going to sleep here on floor, all right?
You take the bed.

47:08.057 --> 47:12.317
- A lot's happened since you broke up with me.
- Are you gonna keep throwing that in my face?

47:12.437 --> 47:17.241
No. Hey, look, we need to talk, all right?
I think you were right to dump me.

47:17.358 --> 47:19.448
Ryan, you need to stop being a martyr, okay?

47:19.569 --> 47:22.950
This is a sure thing. Just relax.

47:23.072 --> 47:25.327
No, wait! I... I... I'm...

47:25.450 --> 47:27.786
I'm saying we want different things.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.959
Oh, really? And what do you want? That nerd?

47:31.080 --> 47:34.094
- Could you keep your voice down?
- Well, what does she do for you, Ryan?

47:34.209 --> 47:38.385
She ride you like this? Like...
Oh, yeah! Oh, Ryan, you're the best!

47:38.505 --> 47:41.553
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!

47:41.674 --> 47:45.186
- Cut it out!
- Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh! Oh, yeah!

47:45.303 --> 47:46.857
Oh, yeah!

47:46.971 --> 47:49.901
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan!

47:50.016 --> 47:52.602
- Oh, yes, you're the best!
- Cut it out, please!

47:52.727 --> 47:54.898
Oh... Oh, yeah!

47:55.021 --> 47:57.073
Oh, Ryan! Oh, yeah!

47:57.190 --> 48:00.287
- Yeah, Ryan! I shop at Target!
- Cut it out. Ssh!

48:00.401 --> 48:03.830
Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh, my gosh!

48:03.947 --> 48:07.043
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!

48:07.158 --> 48:11.334
- Cut it out, please!
- Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh, my God! Oh, yeah!

48:14.290 --> 48:17.505
- Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!
- Cut it out!

48:17.627 --> 48:19.513
- Stacy, stop!
- Oh, yeah!

48:19.629 --> 48:21.966
- Stacy, stop! Stop!
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

48:22.090 --> 48:24.724
- Stop! Hey!
- Oh, yeah!

48:24.843 --> 48:27.428
Oh, yeah! Oh, Ryan!

48:27.554 --> 48:30.900
Stacy, you're acting insane!

48:32.892 --> 48:37.404
What the... If that cooz
let out my cats, so help me!

48:57.041 --> 48:58.678
Trixie?

48:58.793 --> 49:00.300
Mayberry?

49:00.420 --> 49:02.047
Trixie?

49:04.851 --> 49:07.480
Oh! Chaz!

49:08.595 --> 49:11.228
Ryan! The bastards have surrounded the house.

49:11.347 --> 49:13.068
Time to put on your big-boy pants, son.

49:13.183 --> 49:16.779
Dad, you don't have to talk to me
like I'm some kind of kid.

49:18.688 --> 49:21.820
Aim high, and I'm not talking
about life goals.

49:21.941 --> 49:24.029
Shoot 'em in the head. Let's move!

49:24.152 --> 49:27.580
Stacy, how could you do that to me?

49:29.282 --> 49:32.913
- Didn't last night mean anything to you?
- Well, of course it did.

49:33.036 --> 49:34.922
I think.

49:36.831 --> 49:40.462
But, you know, Ryan's just so
good-looking, you know? It's...

49:43.171 --> 49:45.935
That one's coming fast, Chaz. Chaz?

49:46.049 --> 49:47.970
Chaz, that one's coming pretty fast.

49:50.595 --> 49:53.359
Help! God, help me!

49:53.473 --> 49:55.941
Please, God! Don't let me die!

49:59.354 --> 50:01.544
Commie bastard!

50:05.318 --> 50:07.121
Attaboy! Good job!

50:07.237 --> 50:09.957
Chaz! Look out behind...

50:13.660 --> 50:15.416
- He's been bit.
- Oh, no, Chaz!

50:15.537 --> 50:19.000
He's been bit. Get him on the couch!
I'll take care of the door.

50:31.772 --> 50:33.492
Chew-a-dent!

50:34.556 --> 50:37.877
Oh! Oh, God! Ruby!

50:39.686 --> 50:42.900
Honey, I am so sorry.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.118
I completely forgot you were in there.
What the...

50:49.487 --> 50:53.165
I must be the most
selfish person in the world.

50:54.200 --> 50:59.455
Here I am, acting like I'm doing you
some kind of favour by keeping you alive.

50:59.581 --> 51:03.294
Deluding myself that there might
actually be a cure for this.

51:03.418 --> 51:05.921
But really I just...

51:07.005 --> 51:09.946
I can't bring myself to end it for you.

51:13.845 --> 51:17.024
I never would have talked
to Ryan without you.

51:17.140 --> 51:20.402
And though I deeply regret

51:20.518 --> 51:22.819
meeting that...

51:22.937 --> 51:25.357
elitist man-whore,

51:25.481 --> 51:28.162
for one night, damn it,

51:28.276 --> 51:30.032
I lived, Ruby.

51:30.153 --> 51:31.743
I lived.

51:38.244 --> 51:40.296
What the ding-dong?

51:47.170 --> 51:50.053
Hi! Would you shut it off, please?

51:50.173 --> 51:52.807
- Shut it down. Thank you.
- Hi.

51:52.926 --> 51:55.979
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

51:56.554 --> 52:00.777
So I... I guess you guys have heard
about the zombies in town?

52:00.892 --> 52:03.989
Zombies? Zombies!
Guys, she said there's zombies!

52:04.103 --> 52:06.868
Yeah, we heard about the zombies.
That's why we're here.

52:06.981 --> 52:10.825
So if you wouldn't mind taking the keys out
and coming inside that tent,

52:10.944 --> 52:13.708
we've got a little bit of coffee
and a whole lot of questions for you.

52:13.821 --> 52:16.123
If we're going to be honest here,

52:16.241 --> 52:20.855
I was really looking forward to putting
some distance between me and this town.

52:20.974 --> 52:22.589
I get it! I get it!

52:22.705 --> 52:26.466
You're like, "Who's this powerful
muckity-muck trying to cramp my style,

52:26.584 --> 52:29.514
when all I wanna do is try on
some lipstick and chase guys,

52:29.629 --> 52:33.307
and get as far as I can from those
gosh-darn flesh-eaters?" Am I right?

52:33.424 --> 52:35.726
If I say yes, will you let me go?

52:35.844 --> 52:37.896
Let me put it this way...

52:46.281 --> 52:48.582
That's a no.

52:56.698 --> 53:01.503
Hey, I've got some John Cougar Mellencamp.
That always used to cheer you up.

53:01.619 --> 53:06.128
It's just John Mellencamp now, Dad. I haven't
listened to him on purpose in 20 years.

53:07.375 --> 53:09.843
Son, I liked Stacy.

53:11.254 --> 53:15.347
Although I'm not sure she was the girl your
mother would have wanted you to marry,

53:15.466 --> 53:17.935
I am sorry that she got her brains eaten.

53:19.012 --> 53:21.017
- Don't do this, Dad.
- Do what?

53:21.139 --> 53:24.104
- I'm just being real here.
- I'm not ready to be cool with you.

53:24.225 --> 53:28.615
Oh, good, good.
What, you think I wanted any of this, huh?

53:29.689 --> 53:32.074
Look at Chaz back there.

53:32.192 --> 53:35.905
When he turns, who do you think's
gonna have to put him down?

53:37.947 --> 53:41.459
For all of his faults, I loved that boy
like he was my own son.

53:42.785 --> 53:44.506
What do you mean?

53:44.621 --> 53:47.835
Well, Chaz was adopted. You knew that, right?

53:47.957 --> 53:51.054
- Son-of-a-bitch. He was adopted?
- Bottom line is...

53:51.169 --> 53:52.759
you and I have to stay positive,

53:52.879 --> 53:55.216
remember how fortunate we are to be
in the Governor's good graces.

53:55.340 --> 53:56.893
- Fortunate?
- Yes.

53:57.008 --> 54:00.721
If you weren't so deep in the Governor's
good graces, we wouldn't be in this mess.

54:00.845 --> 54:02.518
Well, we're almost out of it, okay.

54:05.808 --> 54:07.529
Ow! Gaa!

54:08.811 --> 54:13.367
- Buy a girl a drink first, will you?
- I'm sorry about that business there.

54:13.483 --> 54:15.570
- Sincerely!
- I'm not infected.

54:15.693 --> 54:18.826
- I wasn't bitten.
- I know, Deb, I know.

54:18.947 --> 54:21.331
We just have protocols we have to follow.

54:21.449 --> 54:23.917
You guys aren't real military, are you?

54:24.035 --> 54:25.708
What is "real"?

54:25.828 --> 54:29.672
Is "real" like a construct
of our own subconscious or...

54:29.791 --> 54:31.713
Is this real?

54:31.835 --> 54:33.590
Is this real?

54:33.711 --> 54:35.384
- Are any of us real?
- Yeah.

54:35.505 --> 54:37.344
The rest of us are real.

54:37.465 --> 54:40.051
All right, we're a private security firm
hired to handle this situation.

54:40.176 --> 54:42.810
Whoa! You guys are doing a bang-up job!

54:42.929 --> 54:44.934
- Thank you.
- I'm being sarcastic.

54:45.056 --> 54:47.275
- What are you gonna do now, kill me?
- Kill you? Deb...

54:47.392 --> 54:49.728
That hurts me. Come on!

54:49.853 --> 54:53.316
I am a father, all right?
Look, look at these.

54:53.439 --> 54:55.491
Look at these little... Two little boys.

54:55.608 --> 54:59.037
- Those are my kids. They are adorable, right?
- Yeah.

54:59.153 --> 55:03.495
Could I go back and look at these little
angels in their eyes with murder on my brain?

55:03.616 --> 55:05.835
I don't think so, Deb.

55:05.952 --> 55:10.045
No, your test was negative.
You are free to go.

55:10.164 --> 55:11.292
Oh!

55:11.416 --> 55:13.421
Awesome sauce!

55:13.543 --> 55:15.595
Okay, great! Um...

55:15.712 --> 55:20.054
Oh, if you could just, uh, get rid
of that road block, I'll be... on my way.

55:20.175 --> 55:22.144
Uh... sorry.

55:22.260 --> 55:25.225
I might have been a little confusing there.
You're free to go back.

55:25.346 --> 55:28.941
- Wait, I'm sorry, back?
- Yeah, back to where you came from.

55:29.058 --> 55:31.776
You can't ever leave that town on,
kind of, a forever-type basis.

55:31.895 --> 55:33.567
Forever?

55:33.688 --> 55:37.235
So you're just gonna... you're gonna
wall us in with those things?

55:37.358 --> 55:39.446
That's a fate worse than death.

55:39.569 --> 55:41.989
You're gonna tell that to your two lamo kids?

55:42.113 --> 55:44.165
They're four and six, Deb.

55:44.282 --> 55:47.130
They wouldn't understand
the moral complexity of that situation.

55:47.243 --> 55:50.837
Portland may be a small town, but people
are going to notice if we disappear.

55:50.955 --> 55:53.174
The official story is radiation leak.

55:53.291 --> 55:55.759
I don't think people are going
to be champing at the bit

55:55.877 --> 55:58.214
to go check it out for themselves,
believe you me.

55:58.338 --> 56:01.435
You're not going to get away with this.
They're...

56:01.549 --> 56:05.974
People... people are going to talk.
There's social media, there's like...

56:06.095 --> 56:07.935
Twerking, My Face.

56:08.056 --> 56:12.196
I don't think you've noticed, but
the internet's shut down and cellphones.

56:12.310 --> 56:15.822
Deb, you would have had a better chance
of getting out of here if you were infected.

56:15.939 --> 56:18.157
They're looking for case studies
out there right now,

56:18.274 --> 56:20.659
trying to figure out how to stop this thing.

56:20.777 --> 56:21.951
Wait.

56:22.070 --> 56:25.498
Wait! I know Frank Waverly.
The Governor is sending him a helicopter.

56:25.615 --> 56:28.664
- And I'm supposed to be on it.
- You know Frank Waverly?

56:28.785 --> 56:30.338
Yeah.

56:30.453 --> 56:32.423
Yeah! I do.

56:34.666 --> 56:37.466
The rendezvous point's right up ahead here.

56:37.585 --> 56:40.433
Throw a blanket over your brother,
we don't want to scare anybody.

56:45.301 --> 56:48.101
- Oh, God! He looks terrible.
- Oh, jeez!

56:48.221 --> 56:49.265
God!

56:54.936 --> 56:58.816
Whoa! Deb's car. She's here.
I hope she's okay.

56:58.940 --> 57:02.238
Was that girl ever okay?
Now let me do the talking.

57:02.360 --> 57:05.457
Some say shooting a gun's like an organism.

57:05.572 --> 57:07.873
That must be why it's harder
for women to shoot g...

57:07.991 --> 57:09.912
- What the hell is going on here?
- Oh!

57:10.034 --> 57:13.747
- Well, if it isn't Don Juan Demarco.
- No, no, that wasn't what it sounded like.

57:13.872 --> 57:18.213
- Prop a squat here, One Direction.
- I have very classic masculine features, sir.

57:19.502 --> 57:22.385
- Why is she restrained?
- Oh, you must be Frank Waverly.

57:22.505 --> 57:24.593
And you must be fond of digging ditches,

57:24.716 --> 57:27.017
cos that's what you're gonna be doing
if I don't get some goddamn answers!

57:27.135 --> 57:29.769
- You know, the Governor...
- Is sending a helicopter, yeah?

57:29.888 --> 57:32.058
- I know.
- Hello, Frank.

57:32.182 --> 57:34.650
I thought I owed it to you
to do this face to face.

57:34.767 --> 57:37.022
- You're not going anywhere.
- Governor.

57:38.521 --> 57:40.657
- Why?
- We screwed the pooch, Frank.

57:40.773 --> 57:44.119
Well, you did. At least, that's how
history is going to show it.

57:44.235 --> 57:48.957
I have volumes of documentation.
This whole thing was on your demand.

57:49.073 --> 57:51.375
My people are at your home
and your office right now.

57:51.492 --> 57:54.078
I don't think documentation is going
to be much of a problem.

57:54.204 --> 57:56.968
Why, self-serving son-of-a...

58:03.755 --> 58:05.724
Let the young ones go.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.810
They had no part in this.

58:07.926 --> 58:09.895
I wish I could, Frank.

58:10.011 --> 58:13.808
Colonel Newton, I think you saw
these three try to rush the border.

58:13.932 --> 58:17.111
I think you had to use some
extreme measures to stop them.

58:17.227 --> 58:19.029
And I think you succeeded.

58:19.145 --> 58:20.948
Sir.

58:21.064 --> 58:22.985
Goodbye, Frank.

58:24.067 --> 58:24.992
Wait!

58:25.109 --> 58:29.250
My dad has more than enough motivation
to keep quiet and I'm his son.

58:29.364 --> 58:31.001
- So?
- So...

58:31.115 --> 58:33.701
the only wild card here is her.
She's a reporter.

58:33.826 --> 58:35.499
What? I'm not a reporter!

58:35.620 --> 58:38.088
I mean, I would like to be a reporter.
I'm trying to be a reporter.

58:38.206 --> 58:39.677
She films everything.

58:39.791 --> 58:43.753
She's documented this whole disaster
with this tiny little hidden camera.

58:43.878 --> 58:46.049
Somebody's gonna find that footage one day.

58:46.172 --> 58:48.260
Wouldn't you like to get
your hands on it right now?

58:48.383 --> 58:51.064
I patted her down myself.
I did not find a camera.

58:51.177 --> 58:54.274
Deb, just give it up.
They're going to search Otis eventually.

58:54.389 --> 58:56.773
Otis? That's her car.

58:56.891 --> 59:00.024
The footage is in her car.
Let's go! You, with me.

59:01.187 --> 59:02.575
The car!

59:03.898 --> 59:06.947
I got the glove box.
Dekker, you pop the hood.

59:07.068 --> 59:10.532
- Try the trunk.
- What? No! Not the trunk!

59:11.906 --> 59:13.033
Pop it.

59:13.157 --> 59:15.922
Governor, sir. Mr Governor...

59:16.995 --> 59:18.336
What the... Damn thing...

59:23.626 --> 59:25.881
What? Holy... Oh, man!

59:26.004 --> 59:28.424
Get that... get that... get that...

59:30.717 --> 59:34.015
Hey, man, that was an accident.

59:34.137 --> 59:36.521
That was a mistake, man.
Don't do it. Put your gun down.

59:36.639 --> 59:39.688
I didn't mean to shoot him.
Come on, we know each other!

59:39.809 --> 59:42.443
That was just a...

59:42.562 --> 59:45.112
- Oh, this is all my fault.
- Ugh!

59:45.231 --> 59:48.660
It's customary to say something like,
"No, no, no, don't beat yourself up."

59:48.776 --> 59:50.698
- Words to that effect.
- Don't beat yourself...

59:50.820 --> 59:53.205
Never mind. It really is my fault.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.743
But I'm going to make it right
for the two of you.

59:55.867 --> 59:58.252
- What are you talking about?
- Frank?

01:00:04.198 --> 01:00:06.037
Come on!

01:00:09.797 --> 01:00:11.553
Ruby, no!

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.718
Huh?

01:00:13.801 --> 01:00:15.771
Go, go! Let's go.

01:00:16.721 --> 01:00:17.773
Dad!

01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:22.361
Ryan. Ryan, I should have been there
more for you when you were growing up.

01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:24.316
I could have helped you
be a little more rugged.

01:00:24.437 --> 01:00:26.489
Why are you talking like that?
You're coming with us.

01:00:26.606 --> 01:00:28.576
No! Like this?

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.198
I'm gone, son.

01:00:30.318 --> 01:00:33.533
Bit by a zombie in a God-awful sweater.

01:00:33.655 --> 01:00:36.953
Now listen up. You stay
with that girl Deb, all right?

01:00:37.075 --> 01:00:40.005
She's good for you. She's got moxie.

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:42.837
Head back into Portland and
stay alive till this blows over.

01:00:42.956 --> 01:00:45.376
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You go take care of her.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.470
Go on! Go!

01:00:47.585 --> 01:00:48.759
Go!

01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:58.099
All right, come on!
End it for me, you piss-ants!

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.858
My dad...

01:01:08.982 --> 01:01:11.153
Chaz, Stacy.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.705
I can't believe they're all gone.

01:01:15.947 --> 01:01:20.787
Nobody left to tell me
what to think or what to say.

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.297
It's kinda scary, actually.

01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:34.390
That time my family was up on the roof,
that Fourth of July, and saw my dad.

01:01:34.507 --> 01:01:35.634
Yeah?

01:01:36.885 --> 01:01:39.602
He wasn't fixing the barbecue.

01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:43.019
He was in my neighbour's backyard...

01:01:44.517 --> 01:01:46.522
with no pants.

01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:51.283
He was exposing himself to their family dog.

01:01:53.401 --> 01:01:54.908
Whoa!

01:01:55.028 --> 01:01:57.364
Apparently, he'd been doing it for months.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.872
Basset hound.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.457
He moved out after that.

01:02:07.874 --> 01:02:10.294
I've never told that story to anyone.

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.925
We've never going to get out of here, are we?

01:02:18.009 --> 01:02:20.144
Does not look like it.

01:02:20.261 --> 01:02:22.349
All the roads will be blocked
just like that one.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.607
- They'll be looking for us especially.
- Hmm.

01:02:24.724 --> 01:02:27.821
On the bright side, no more lines at the DMV.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:29.987
Yeah.

01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:33.568
I bet some of those workers
will be more lively as zombies.

01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:36.372
Mmmm! Rrrgh!

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.823
Organ donor!

01:02:38.947 --> 01:02:40.584
Delicious!

01:02:40.698 --> 01:02:44.162
- What was that? Is that...
- My zombie.

01:02:44.285 --> 01:02:47.085
- I didn't know zombies sounded like that.
- Yeah. You've heard them, right?

01:02:47.205 --> 01:02:49.697
No, I haven't heard them talk.

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:53.095
Oh, my God!

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.800
Only you could make me laugh
at a time like this.

01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:03.264
That's mostly what I remember
about the night that we hung out.

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:05.559
Was you just cracking me up.

01:03:09.894 --> 01:03:11.484
No one thinks I'm funny.

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:14.238
They just think I'm strange or...

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.991
awkward or...

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:19.329
I say the wrong thing.

01:03:21.114 --> 01:03:24.495
I'm so dumb to think
that I could be an on-air anchor.

01:03:24.617 --> 01:03:26.753
I think you'd make a great news anchor.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.211
Plus I've always wanted to slap the tan
right off of Brent Masters' face.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:44.598
Oh, my God, Ryan!

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:47.734
Ryan, we have to go, now.

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire?

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.072
You mentioning Brent Masters back there.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.111
If the outside world could see
what was actually going on here,

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.906
the government would have to do something.

01:03:59.027 --> 01:04:01.032
The people would demand it.
We'd have a chance.

01:04:01.154 --> 01:04:03.657
Yeah, but how? All communications
have been shut down.

01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.118
Phone, cable, internet, cell towers.

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.535
Not satellite.

01:04:17.795 --> 01:04:20.264
Get the lead out.

01:04:20.381 --> 01:04:22.932
Our signal goes out to most
of the outlying counties,

01:04:23.051 --> 01:04:24.937
sometimes as far as Canada.

01:04:25.053 --> 01:04:27.188
- Where is everyone though?
- I don't know.

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:30.520
It would be a skeleton crew
because of the holiday, but...

01:04:33.311 --> 01:04:36.159
The morning staff briefing.

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.194
Livelier than usual.

01:04:38.316 --> 01:04:42.112
Hey, that's Misty Raines.
Ah, they're still smiling.

01:04:42.237 --> 01:04:46.080
She's got so much Botox in her face I don't
know if she's ever going to decompose.

01:04:46.199 --> 01:04:48.334
And that's Jerry Chavez, sports.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.714
Oh, and he brought his wife's
famous cupcakes.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.836
Oh! Brent Masters.

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:57.805
Even as a zombie, his hair is camera perfect!

01:04:57.919 --> 01:05:00.339
- Oh, is he coming?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:03.927
He was always mean to me,
but I'm going to do him proud.

01:05:06.459 --> 01:05:08.759
Okay, let's... let's go.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:15.025
Control room's in here. Oh?

01:05:22.735 --> 01:05:25.583
We have to turn the signal back on.

01:05:25.697 --> 01:05:29.707
- Wow, you really know what you're doing.
- Yeah, I have my moments.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:32.839
- Despite my track record.
- Yeah, what does this do?

01:05:32.954 --> 01:05:35.252
Okay, don't touch that.

01:05:47.093 --> 01:05:51.565
And that's it! You just lock the camera off
on the anchor desk.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.484
On you, right?

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.320
Ah, yeah.

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:57.107
Yeah, I guess.

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:01.114
- What's wrong?
- Uh...

01:06:01.232 --> 01:06:02.620
I'm just, uh...

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.363
so used to working the camera.

01:06:06.487 --> 01:06:09.371
Maybe I should do that and
you can do the announcement.

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:10.701
- Deb.
- What?

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:15.963
Listen to me. Not only is this an insanely
perfect opportunity for you to live your dream,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.343
but people need to know
what's happening here.

01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:23.136
What about you, Ryan Waverly?
Are you living your dream?

01:06:23.254 --> 01:06:26.967
I want to be a personal life coach. So, yes.

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.431
Well played, sir.

01:06:33.014 --> 01:06:34.225
Okay!

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.195
You know, I'm going to clean up.

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:41.111
I can't make my broadcast debut
with a scrunchie in my hair.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.864
- Okay. I'll be here. Hurry.
- Okay.

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.217
Deb, are you all...

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:02.795
right?

01:07:06.005 --> 01:07:08.888
What do you think? Is this okay for camera?

01:07:10.051 --> 01:07:12.270
It's... uh...

01:07:12.387 --> 01:07:14.273
You're perfect.

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:18.400
I raided the weather girl's locker.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.529
Are you ready?

01:07:29.237 --> 01:07:30.957
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:07:31.072 --> 01:07:34.915
This is how I always see them do it.
In five, four...

01:07:35.034 --> 01:07:36.588
Three...

01:07:38.913 --> 01:07:41.796
Good afternoon. I'm Deb Clarington.

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:44.420
It was an Independence Day for the ages,

01:07:44.544 --> 01:07:47.427
as a bizarre disease ran rampant
through this normally peaceful

01:07:47.547 --> 01:07:49.634
seaside community yesterday.

01:07:49.757 --> 01:07:53.435
Homes were destroyed,
countless family members lost

01:07:53.553 --> 01:07:55.973
and thousands left to wander,

01:07:56.097 --> 01:08:00.059
in search of the only thing that would
quench their now insatiable appetites...

01:08:00.185 --> 01:08:03.091
live human flesh.

01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:08.663
Unbelievable? Maybe.

01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:12.869
It certainly would be easier to swallow
the cover-up story about a radiation leak.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:18.587
Indeed, for all we know, there are only two
souls left uninfected in this once-happy hamlet.

01:08:18.703 --> 01:08:24.301
Is it worth sending people in to save a fledgling
newscaster and her cameraman life coach?

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:27.631
Two days ago, I might have said no.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.300
But then another story broke.

01:08:31.424 --> 01:08:33.844
This one easier to believe for most,

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:37.848
but for this reporter,
it's the headline of the decade...

01:08:37.971 --> 01:08:40.523
woman falls in love.

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.774
Sure it happens every day,
all over the world, but not to me.

01:08:46.898 --> 01:08:50.196
Maybe a crisis like we have here
speeds things up a bit, but...

01:08:50.318 --> 01:08:53.746
I don't think it can create
something from nothing.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:59.036
And even though this person
may not return my affections...

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.174
and... I am really not fishing here...

01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:04.542
it's okay.

01:09:04.666 --> 01:09:09.671
I'll always know, deep down,
that he felt something too.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:13.308
So I'm Deb Clarington, saying yes,

01:09:13.424 --> 01:09:15.595
I think these two are worth saving.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:20.108
So if you're watching out there, please tell the
authorities to send help to Portland, Maine...

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:25.295
No! No!

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:30.573
Deb. Deb, I'm here. Hey!

01:09:30.692 --> 01:09:34.535
Listen to me, that's the greatest newscast
anyone's ever seen.

01:09:34.654 --> 01:09:37.832
Seriously, you'll probably win
a Peabody or something.

01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:39.669
Am I...

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.546
better than Brent Masters?

01:09:42.662 --> 01:09:44.501
Crazy better.

01:09:45.874 --> 01:09:48.633
Wait, crazy, like I was,
like, a crazy person?

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:54.175
Can we get, like, two seconds!

01:10:00.847 --> 01:10:03.184
I don't know how long I have left.

01:10:03.308 --> 01:10:06.249
Yeah, I guess we've never seen
anyone turn before.

01:10:12.734 --> 01:10:14.703
- Listen, Deb.
- Yes.

01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:17.453
If you want me to, I could, um...

01:10:18.698 --> 01:10:20.834
I mean, if you want.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.252
You would shoot me in the head?

01:10:24.329 --> 01:10:27.093
Well, I... What? I thought...

01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:29.508
I guess it would be one tap now?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.382
It was your idea first!

01:10:31.503 --> 01:10:36.216
Tonight's top story, a bizarre twist regarding
a reported radiation leak in Portland, Maine.

01:10:36.341 --> 01:10:40.137
A broadcast, apparently originating
from within the quarantine zone,

01:10:40.261 --> 01:10:42.765
went viral on the internet just hours ago,

01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:46.401
promoting a lot of people to wonder
what exactly is going on there?

01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:51.737
I'm Deb Clarington saying yes,
I think these two are worth saving.

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:56.049
So if you're watching out there, please tell the
authorities to send help to Portland, Maine...

01:10:57.695 --> 01:10:59.451
No! No!

01:10:59.572 --> 01:11:03.997
911 emergency centres in several
states report being flooded with calls

01:11:04.118 --> 01:11:06.206
in response to the alleged zombie attack,

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.630
with some calling to ask if the video's real,

01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:12.177
while many others are concerned
for the safety of these two people.

01:11:12.293 --> 01:11:16.635
A background check on Deb Clarington
revealed that she is employed at the station

01:11:16.756 --> 01:11:20.813
from which she's broadcasting,
but as a camera-person, not an anchor.

01:11:20.927 --> 01:11:23.940
Prior to that, she was employed
at a Lady Footlocker,

01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:26.226
until she was let go for staging

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:29.980
an unauthorised sock-puppet production
of Jesus Christ Superstar.

01:11:30.103 --> 01:11:34.742
A lot has been said about videos going viral
but, for Deb Clarington, it's like an outbreak.

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:38.072
The hits on her zombie-attack clip
is impressive enough,

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:42.454
but it's the number of her viewers weighing
in and creating their own online videos

01:11:42.574 --> 01:11:43.867
that's truly staggering.

01:11:43.992 --> 01:11:46.672
As the chairman of the Zombie
Outbreak Authentication Society

01:11:46.786 --> 01:11:51.792
I happen to know zombies
and that is not real. It's too tan.

01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:54.171
I can tell bad effects work from a mile away.

01:11:54.294 --> 01:11:56.180
This is the real deal, man. It's not bogus.

01:11:56.296 --> 01:12:00.472
Oh, that girl is my new hero.
What is going on right now?

01:12:00.592 --> 01:12:04.554
Deb, if you're still alive out there,
I want you to know, you are so hot!

01:12:04.679 --> 01:12:08.061
They say they're in Maine?
That's not even a real state.

01:12:08.183 --> 01:12:13.486
Deb, encouraged by your example, I told
a co-worker that he is the love of my life.

01:12:13.605 --> 01:12:15.657
He's my boss, he's happily married.

01:12:15.773 --> 01:12:18.822
So we both agreed it best
that I look for another job.

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:22.158
Originally, I planned to debunk this vid
using basic physics.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.997
Then I thought about recreating
part of it with some friends.

01:12:25.116 --> 01:12:27.501
Those idiots actually think
this thing is real.

01:12:27.619 --> 01:12:30.668
Is the video real in your own opinion?

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:33.374
I believe that the woman in the video
believes it's real.

01:12:33.499 --> 01:12:35.552
Now, how sure are you?

01:12:35.668 --> 01:12:38.172
She exhibits all five signs of a person
who's speaking the truth.

01:12:38.296 --> 01:12:42.970
I expound more on this, of course, in my book
The Five Signs Of Truth, which is available...

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.263
What the fudge?

01:12:45.386 --> 01:12:49.479
As night falls on Portland, Maine,
more questions than answers.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:53.941
Repeated calls to the Governor's office from
this station and many others around the country

01:12:54.062 --> 01:12:59.412
have gone unanswered, but we will not rest
until we get to the bottom of this situation.

01:13:00.485 --> 01:13:03.119
Now how about this hilarious cat video?

01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:06.203
Yes, Deb!

01:13:06.324 --> 01:13:09.836
You did it! They'll have to investigate now,
they'll just have to.

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:12.717
Well, I'm really happy for you, Ryan.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:17.671
Let's get real here. We both know in a few
minutes I'll be trying to eat your brains.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:20.593
Well, the joke's on you then,
cos it will be a small meal.

01:13:20.713 --> 01:13:24.936
Really? You are starting to look
so delicious right now.

01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:27.732
And you're starting to look like
you've lost a lot of blood.

01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:32.235
- Does it matter at this point?
- It matters to me. Where's the first-aid kit?

01:13:33.434 --> 01:13:37.694
I think it's in the break room, but it's
too far unless we go through the studio.

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:40.033
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

01:13:45.947 --> 01:13:48.166
No! No, no, no, no.

01:13:48.283 --> 01:13:50.085
I have an idea.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.301
Hear me, undead!

01:13:55.415 --> 01:13:58.879
This man is a friend to us. He means us no...

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.007
Oh, God! Oh, I regret that.

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:06.515
Ooh!

01:14:11.556 --> 01:14:13.691
Oh, that was awesome!

01:14:17.437 --> 01:14:19.572
Ladies first.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.156
Oh, wrong way!

01:14:24.277 --> 01:14:25.997
Come on!

01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:31.835
Stairs!

01:14:58.478 --> 01:15:01.277
Deb, Deb! Come on, come on,
we've gotta get going.

01:15:01.397 --> 01:15:05.241
No! Ryan, it's the end of the line for me.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.574
- Okay, I... I... I'll carry you. Come on.
- Where?

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.203
Listen. We've had a good run.

01:15:13.326 --> 01:15:16.672
But I'm starting to get hungry.

01:15:16.788 --> 01:15:19.837
I can really see myself
going to town on your liver.

01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:23.090
Your spleen, maybe a couple of pancreas.

01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:25.892
Your pancreas is actually singular.

01:15:26.005 --> 01:15:27.678
Oh, thank you, Bill Nye.

01:15:27.799 --> 01:15:30.480
Ooh! Hey, hey! Stay with me, stay with me!

01:15:31.636 --> 01:15:34.271
Ryan, what are you still doing here?

01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:36.857
You could outrun Misty Raines easily.

01:15:36.975 --> 01:15:40.937
And now you're bound to end up
like one of us or die a horrible death.

01:15:41.062 --> 01:15:44.693
I'd rather take that risk than be
without the people I care about.

01:15:44.816 --> 01:15:46.619
The people you...

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:52.334
Oh, you mean me? Duh!
I'm the people you care about?

01:15:54.576 --> 01:15:58.110
I really wish we'd gotten to watch
the fireworks together on your roof.

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.442
That would have been awesome.

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:04.379
But now I'm starving.

01:16:04.502 --> 01:16:05.713
Okay, hey.

01:16:05.837 --> 01:16:07.225
Here.

01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:09.260
Do what you gotta do.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:13.103
Thank you.

01:16:19.934 --> 01:16:21.322
Got him!

01:16:23.521 --> 01:16:25.111
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.580
Deb, right? We are huge fans.

01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:34.544
- Are you good to go?
- Oh! Wait. What?

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:38.370
You have a bite wound there. Just keep
it clean and change that bandage daily.

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:41.175
No, she was bitten by a zombie.

01:16:43.791 --> 01:16:45.844
Are you talking about what
those people back there have?

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.131
- Yeah!
- You can't get that from biting.

01:16:48.254 --> 01:16:51.718
Yeah, that is really
an archaic way of thinking.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:55.982
I mean, a biter would have to have an open
wound in his mouth literally gushing blood.

01:16:56.095 --> 01:17:00.651
Even then, it's like a thousand to one.
What are you, some kind of zombie-phobe?

01:17:00.767 --> 01:17:04.361
No, no. A lot of my best friends are zombies.

01:17:04.479 --> 01:17:05.736
Probably.

01:17:07.065 --> 01:17:09.615
We're just messing with you.
These things are hideous.

01:17:09.734 --> 01:17:12.664
- Yeah, filthy!
- But you can't get it from a bite, so...

01:17:12.779 --> 01:17:15.247
Turns out it was in the water or something.

01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:16.753
Who knew?

01:17:22.247 --> 01:17:26.304
- You said you wanted to eat me.
- Yeah, that's embarrassing.

01:17:26.417 --> 01:17:29.265
You talked about internal organs.
I mean, it got really specific.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:32.309
- Well, I was delirious, okay.
- You sure you don't want to now?

01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:37.935
- Mm, you said some things, too.
- I know I did.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.525
So...

01:17:39.639 --> 01:17:42.818
It's safe to assume that you like me.

01:17:45.645 --> 01:17:46.689
Hey!

01:17:46.813 --> 01:17:49.862
How did you guys figure out
this virus so fast?

01:17:49.983 --> 01:17:53.744
- Oh, we had a little help.
- Dad!

01:17:53.862 --> 01:17:54.905
Ryan!

01:17:55.029 --> 01:17:58.078
Hey, Deb. What a night, huh?

01:17:58.199 --> 01:18:02.161
- Turns out biting doesn't turn you.
- Yeah, we heard!

01:18:02.287 --> 01:18:07.341
- But how did you escape the troops?
- Well, like I said, biting doesn't turn you.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:12.471
Come on! What are you waiting for?
I'm already bit, you dumb pansies!

01:18:12.589 --> 01:18:14.973
- Drop the weapon!
- Come on, finish me!

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:17.595
- My head is killing me.
- We are approaching.

01:18:17.719 --> 01:18:21.358
- Put it down!
- Make me, you dumb-ass!

01:18:22.599 --> 01:18:25.446
Dale! Chowder! Mad Dog!

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.114
Chaz.

01:18:27.228 --> 01:18:30.076
Jazzy Chazzy. That's my Pop.
Be careful with him, okay?

01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:31.945
- Oh?
- Son!

01:18:32.066 --> 01:18:34.237
Pops, we play billiards.
Be cool! That's my Pops!

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.116
- That's my boy!
- Yep.

01:18:36.237 --> 01:18:39.619
Came to save you. I wonder where Ryan is?

01:18:39.741 --> 01:18:42.244
Off with his new girlfriend probably.
I don't see him.

01:18:45.622 --> 01:18:48.172
What's up, douche?

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:51.672
- We're alive and we're under arrest.
- That's my boy!

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:53.135
Yeah!

01:18:53.254 --> 01:18:55.141
Now, come on.

01:18:55.256 --> 01:18:57.511
Hurry up and kiss the girl.

01:18:57.634 --> 01:18:59.805
- Oh...
- I've got a date with the Feds.

01:18:59.928 --> 01:19:03.795
The towns overrun with zombies so they'll
be bombing the hell out of Portland soon.

01:19:05.934 --> 01:19:07.939
Come on!

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:12.067
I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:14.527
You don't have to kiss me.

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:16.620
No, I was going to anyway.
