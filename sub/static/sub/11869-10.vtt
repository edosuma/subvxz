WEBVTT

00:16.433 --> 00:17.889
Evening, Sheriff.
Cold enough for you?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.805
Yeah. Exactly how
the holidays should be.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.054
Hey, guys.
Happy holidays.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.304
What's up?

00:24.441 --> 00:25.977
Yeah. Whatever.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.477
What's up with them?
Yeah, they're cranky
because we're snowbound.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.979
Their vacation plans
are pretty much ruined.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.273
Oh.

00:35.494 --> 00:38.611
Um, why don't you make
a round of hot chocolate?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.908
Keep them coming.
You got it.

00:41.792 --> 00:45.580
Hey, guys.
So, stuck in Eureka
for the holidays, huh?

00:45.963 --> 00:48.830
| used to try to escape
Eureka at Christmas

00:48.966 --> 00:52.424
until one year when
I got stranded here.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.428
Yeah.
It was crazy.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.637
(CHUCKLING)
Okay, gather 'round.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.767
You can hear
all about it.
Do we have to?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.057
Sheriff's badge says yes.
(KIDS SIGHING)

01:14.950 --> 01:16.110
There you go. Enjoy.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.232
Oh, boy.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.489
Ah.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.080
It was deep in December
and, like every year,

01:24.209 --> 01:27.167
Zoe and l were
heading out of town
to spend the holiday

01:27.296 --> 01:28.832
with family,
which was great

01:28.964 --> 01:32.957
because it was one
of the hottest Christmas weeks
Eureka had ever seen.

01:36.972 --> 01:37.961
What's going on?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.838
You can't leave, Sheriff.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.181
No one in or out.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.972
The electromagnetic shield
over Eureka's malfunctioning.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.726
Doesn't look like
anything's...
(SCREAMS)

01:51.653 --> 01:54.269
Right now, it's more
electro than magnetic.
It's getting worse.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.442
You better shut
that thing down.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.488
And leave Global Dynamics
vulnerable to the prying eyes
of the rest of the world?

02:00.621 --> 02:01.952
Sorry, Sheriff,
no can do.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.873
So, we're trapped here
for Christmas?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.700
It's 85 degrees.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.294
Dad, they're trying to fix it.
Just let them.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.253
All right, well,
don't overexert yourselves.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.550
We'll make
the best of it.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.387
Merry Christmas!

02:22.559 --> 02:25.016
ZOE: Wait, so you make
elf footprints?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.808
Yeah, you dip little sponges
shaped like shoes
in baby powder

02:28.940 --> 02:32.023
and then you press them
on the floor around
the presents.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.730
You know what?
I'm boiling.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.819
You can't let a little heat
ruin your holiday.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.031
Today l have strung up
cranberries, we have
baked gingerbread.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.072
All right,
feast your eyes, people.

02:43.705 --> 02:48.290
Limited edition,
copper cast
from my Secret Santa.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.576
Oh, and he left this for you.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.214
For me? Wow, how cool.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.337
You know who it is?
No. That's why
he's a secret.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.460
Open it.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.961
Come on.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.846
Oh, wow, The Clash on vinyl.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.105
I love them.
I wonder who knew.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.649
Not you.
Well, come on...

03:13.902 --> 03:14.812
(LAUGHS)

03:14.945 --> 03:16.606
No, I couldn't have.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.898
ALLISON: No, wasn't me.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.068
Well, this is
my little gift
to all of you.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.988
You say little.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.951
Is that meatloaf?
lt's fruit cake.

03:28.667 --> 03:33.582
Oh. Um, yeah,
I'm still digesting
a piece from last year.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.831
No, no, no, trust me.
This is like a little
Christmas miracle.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.923
Eat it. Eat it.
VINCENT: Come on.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.963
(ALLISON LAUGHS)

03:45.016 --> 03:47.883
Oh. Holy cow!

03:48.937 --> 03:50.017
Oh!

03:51.940 --> 03:54.682
That... Even the raisins
are incredible.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.479
I blended 96
different varieties.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.476
Everything from Alexandroulis
to Zilvaca.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.114
How do you get them
all in one piece?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.401
That, my friend,
is the secret.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.986
CARTER: Mmm.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.575
(BEEPING)

04:05.704 --> 04:06.944
Oh.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.037
What's going on?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.326
It's a code 12.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.745
Air assault.
We have a bogey.
(SIREN BLARING)

04:12.878 --> 04:15.369
All right, everybody, down!
Down! Take cover.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.756
All right, stay inside!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.918
(SIRENS WAILING)

04:20.260 --> 04:22.842
All right, everyone,
can I have your attention?
Can you get inside, please?

04:22.971 --> 04:25.257
This is not a drill.
Possible airstrike
headed for town!

04:25.390 --> 04:27.881
Everyone, get off
the streets now.
Thank you.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.767
Get into position.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.057
CARTER: Sir,
thank you, inside.
Keep it going.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.810
Everybody inside.
Inside. Thank you.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.682
JO: Ready?
Clear! Clear the road!

04:38.737 --> 04:40.443
JO: Steady.
What's up, Jo?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.522
First someone messed
with our E.M. shield,
now we're under attack.

04:43.742 --> 04:44.822
From what?

04:44.951 --> 04:48.739
G.D. radar detected
an unauthorized vehicle
in our airspace over town.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.331
(BEEPING)
Bogey's crossed
the threshold.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.163
Weapons hot!
Take aim!

04:58.215 --> 05:00.331
Oh, hey, hang on!
That's not a plane!

05:04.930 --> 05:06.591
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

05:20.946 --> 05:24.689
Ho! Ho! Ho! Crap!

05:38.922 --> 05:41.538
BOY 1: Santa's sleigh?
Seriously?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
You don't believe me?
GIRL: Where do I start?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.792
One,
reindeer can't fly.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.295
Well, stranger things
have happened in Eureka.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.639
Yeah? And who was driving
this tactical assault sleigh?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.384
I'm getting to that.
So...

05:55.772 --> 05:58.388
It's not every day
we get to track down
a runaway Santa.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.358
So Jo and I,
we jump at the chance.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.819
I want nothing to do
with this.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.064
Oh, like I do.
Hey, the town's your turf.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.816
Which your trigger happy
Santa SWAT team invaded.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.695
Sorry, Carter...
Holiday party starts
soon at G.D.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.116
and I'm on crowd control.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.955
Oh, well, that's...
ZOE: Hey.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.915
Shouldn't you guys be
chasing down Kringle?

06:18.044 --> 06:21.832
No, what I should be doing is
drinking winter ale with your
uncles, watching ball games.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.830
And by watching
he means arguing.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.253
Yes.
Is there someplace else
I can be useful? Please.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.798
Oh, I'm sure Allison
could use some help
at G.D.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.388
A few people got banged up
avoiding Santa. I'll take you.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.262
Perfect. See you, Dad.
Oh.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.384
Give Santa my best.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.181
Chase down
a fake stupid Santa.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.808
It's like 900 degrees.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.275
I'm never going
to get home...

06:44.404 --> 06:45.769
FARGO: To the left.
Yes, chief.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.613
No the other left.
Relax, Fargo,
it's just a party.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.073
No, it's the party.
The time where

06:50.201 --> 06:52.783
G.D. family comes
together in the spirit
of giving.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.619
More candles.
It's time all you geeks

06:54.956 --> 06:56.412
fly your freak flags
every year.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.702
No, that's Comic Con.
Look...

06:58.877 --> 07:01.084
I've got a tight budget
and a building full
of people to feed.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.749
If we run low on latkes,
believe me,
things will get ugly.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.838
I will charge my Taser.
(BEEPING)

07:06.927 --> 07:09.794
Oh, security breach
in Sub Lab 22.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.924
I can't wait for this
day to be over.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.473
Hold it right there.
What do you think
you're doing?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.060
Hey, Jo. Just taking
my experiment home.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.936
And you are?

07:28.156 --> 07:30.397
Noah Drummer.
Condensed matter physicist.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.112
Well, I'm sorry,
Doctor Drummer,

07:33.244 --> 07:35.405
there's no authorization
for you to take
your little ornament home.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.950
Actually,
it's crystallized hydrogen.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.291
Can't leave it here unattended
during the holidays.
Too unstable.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.871
So you're shoving it
into a sack?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.791
Well, it's lined with
non—ionizing fiber
and red tungsten.

07:46.049 --> 07:50.634
If my ornament's
not handled carefully,
bad things could happen.

07:52.597 --> 07:56.340
Yes, it's very menacing.
What is it for, anyway?

07:56.935 --> 07:58.425
Just a little thing called
peace on earth.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.938
It's an energy source.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.773
Once fully formed,
it'll provide limitless power,
very cheaply.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.732
One less reason for war.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.147
Well, that is a very
lovely concept.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.024
But nothing's going
to happen to it here,
not on my watch.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.698
Not that I doubt
your abilities, but I'd really
prefer to keep it with me.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.323
Yeah, I'm sorry, Doc.
The crystal stays here.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.038
All right.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.173
How's that?
Feels okay.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.719
Mostly I'm starving.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.434
That's weird. Me too.
You know what?

08:41.563 --> 08:44.805
It must be Vincent's amazing
hors d'oeuvres we're smelling
from the party.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.896
You're all set.
Thanks.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.857
Merry Christmas,
Doctor Blake, Zoe.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.851
ALLISON: You're
all set, honey.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.862
Hey, you okay?

08:53.450 --> 08:54.565
Yeah.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.693
It's just always
the same thing
every year.

08:58.830 --> 09:03.824
Dad can't wait to go home
and it's always so much better
in theory than in reality.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.792
I'm just actually
really glad that
we're stuck here.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.537
Me too. You know,
we never get to spend
the holidays together.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.914
The more, the merrier.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.711
You really get
into it, huh?

09:12.844 --> 09:16.962
I just think we could all
use a little more magic
in our lives, you know?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.387
Hey look, Secret Santa
struck again.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.766
What...
When did that get here?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.355
ZOE: Open it.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.203
(LAUGHS) Bunny slippers.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.825
I used to have a pair
of these when l was a kid.
This is perfect.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.209
I got to find out
who this guy is.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.950
Kringle can run,
but he can't hide.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.951
(CHUCKLES)

09:50.048 --> 09:51.834
(SIREN WAILING)

09:59.474 --> 10:01.089
Oh, no.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.846
Can I help you?
Mr. Claus, I presume.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.858
Mr. Claus?

10:14.823 --> 10:16.654
Season's greetings, mate.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.819
Taggart, do you have
any idea what you've done?

10:19.702 --> 10:22.694
You've damaged
our E.M. shield,
our E.M. shield!

10:22.831 --> 10:26.540
I did not.
I was held up in
me lab running field tests.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.292
Tests for what?
For science, mate.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.629
I'm pioneering the field
of Santology.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.752
That's not a science.
It will be.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.839
Nearly every culture
has a myth
about the man.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.307
Santa Claus, Pere Noel,
Kris Kringle, Saint Nick.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.637
I'm replicating everything
he does and explaining it
with physics and technology.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.598
What about flying reindeer?
(DEVICE BEEPING)

10:53.486 --> 10:56.899
Holographic.
They're misbehaving currently.

This little beauty runs
on a pulse detonation engine.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.780
Uses state of the art
stealth technology

11:06.916 --> 11:09.623
(WHISPERING) to fly
invisibly under the radar.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.911
Taggan,

11:13.798 --> 11:16.915
your giant red sled
is neither stealthy

11:18.636 --> 11:19.625
nor invisible.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.015
Well, I've still got
a few kinks to work out.

11:23.474 --> 11:28.935
Now, be a Santa's
little helper and give us
a tow back to G.D.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.849
Sure.
Cheers, mate.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.777
Friends, colleagues,

11:41.910 --> 11:44.071
I started planning this party
months ago,

11:44.204 --> 11:48.322
determined to provide
an unforgettable, yet fiscally
responsible celebration.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.703
Today,
we gather together...

11:50.835 --> 11:52.791
Oh, save it, Fargo,
we're starving.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.206
CROWD: Yeah!

11:54.339 --> 11:56.796
Fine.
And without further ado...

11:59.302 --> 12:01.293
(CROWD CHEERING)

12:03.264 --> 12:08.930
Okay, people, you've got
two hours and 58 minutes
until I shut this place down.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.303
Eat, drink, be merry.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.287
TAGGART: It was late
on Christmas Eve.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.751
I was just a wee lad,
no more than seven

12:39.342 --> 12:42.926
(WHISPERING) when I heard
something,
and crept downstairs.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.886
That's when I saw him.
Just a glimpse.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.977
A quick flash of red
by the tree.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.890
Taggart, it was probably
your father in red pajamas.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.689
One might think.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.439
But I found this
by the fireplace.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.615
Lint?
A tear from Santa's trousers.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.156
I've tested the fibers,
they're fire resistant.

13:13.710 --> 13:17.623
Again, not Santa.
Red pajamas.

13:20.049 --> 13:24.884
Also been working
on a gadget for easy
chimney descension.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.308
And fancy this.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.349
I made it just for you.

13:33.688 --> 13:37.647
You went all out.
Imagine all the presents
Santa has to fit in his sack.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.356
But by putting M—theory

13:39.485 --> 13:42.101
and the concept
of 11th dimensionality
into practice...

13:42.238 --> 13:45.150
Yeah, wait, ho, ho, ho.
Wait, Santa's a physicist now?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.356
Oh, he's very clever.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.740
He temporarily shifts matter
through the dimensional
membrane.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.907
That way,
objects can lose mass
but maintain integrity.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.709
(MACHINE WHIRRING)
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:58.921 --> 14:00.707
Don't you want to
open your present?

14:01.591 --> 14:04.549
Set her there, mate.
Come on. Come on.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.259
Holy smokes.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.981
A can of "Christmas Cheer"?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.698
Go on. Pop the top.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.288
(SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROL)

14:41.547 --> 14:43.583
They're programmed
to your voice.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.627
And they're yours
for the day every time
you say, "Christmas."

14:49.639 --> 14:53.302
Thanks, Taggart,
for making this
a very creepy Christmas.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.597
(SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROL)

15:04.529 --> 15:07.692
Santology?
Yeah. I think he's
going for a degree.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.280
Something about
a minor in tooth fairy.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.525
Well, myth and folklore
come from somewhere, Carter.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.573
Some ancient cultures
believed that wrapping
moldy bread on a wound

15:14.705 --> 15:15.831
would make it heal faster.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.618
Yeah, that's why
ancient cultures died out.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.913
No, they didn't know that
mold was penicillin
and it fought off infection.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.753
Yeah, but we're talking
about Santa Claus,
not antibiotics.

15:23.881 --> 15:28.716
As scientists, we have
to explore all possibilities,
to be open to the "what if."

15:33.558 --> 15:34.889
Right there, great.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.009
(SIGHS)

15:40.314 --> 15:43.226
Oh, hey, Lupo,
you want to tell me
what you want for Christmas?

15:43.401 --> 15:46.108
This one's for naughty.
This one's for nice.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.564
I1lpass.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.321
Oh, come on.
Where's your
Christmas spirit?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.779
Seriously,
you okay?

15:53.911 --> 15:58.120
I have a town full of yahoos
that I have to babysit.
I am super.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.248
Taggart's Santa.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.618
You just wrecked Christmas
with two words.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.005
Hmm. Why is it
so hot in here?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.747
I don't know.
The AC. is
cranked up to 11.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.796
Oh, just, hey, hang
on a minute.
Let me just grab a couple.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.424
ljust hope I made enough.
This crowd is ravenous.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.880
Mmm.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.303
Great. More crystal
lab issues.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.721
Do I want to know?

16:19.854 --> 16:21.435
It's this tiny little
glowy thing.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.146
I caught this
strange scientist trying
to take it home earlier.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.890
Well, this is G.D.
Be specific.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.188
Um, his name's Drummer.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.899
Never heard of him.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.946
Doctor Drummer?

16:42.877 --> 16:45.163
I thought you said
little glowy thing.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.217
It used to be.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.767
This is unbelievable.
Under normal conditions,

17:02.897 --> 17:07.482
it would take decades
to crystallize hydrogen
into a sample this size.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.267
Key word, normal.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.894
Is it me
or is it already bigger?

17:13.741 --> 17:14.776
Henry, what's going on?
I don't know,

17:14.909 --> 17:17.241
but if it keeps growing
at this rate, it'll breach
the lab in 20 minutes.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.076
We need to move it
to a larger containment unit.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.991
Doctor Drummer said
that it was unstable.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.659
Uh... Wait,
it's going to explode?

17:22.792 --> 17:25.499
Well, yeah, if it...
If it moves beyond
the protective shielding,

17:25.795 --> 17:27.877
it could fracture
and... Boom.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.464
Merry Christmas.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.925
(SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROL)

17:38.057 --> 17:40.469
How do I turn this off?
Hang on, they're pretty good.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.758
Henry.
All right, all right,
find Doctor Drummer.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.431
I'll supervise the transfer,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.727
and maybe he can
tell us why this
is expanding.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.733
(CONTINUE SINGING)

18:04.166 --> 18:05.576
Man, that guy
must be roasting.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.826
Tell me about it.
I had to ice my hot toddies.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.086
Hey, Zane.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.211
Are you crying?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.890
What? No. No.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.144
I just got two tickets
to see Springsteen
at the Meadowlands.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.560
Let me guess, Secret Santa.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.062
You too?
The perfect gift.
Man, this guy's good.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.742
No one's even heard
of Drummer.
We've been all through G.D.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.736
There are no personnel
files for him.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.113
Well...
That's impossible.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.116
There's no way that he could
have access to the lab,
let alone get into G.D.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.288
We've got to find him.
His experiment's growing.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.250
Well, there has to be a way
to track him down.
The DOD. has files.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.168
The glitch in the EM.
shield crashed our server.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.632
We're cut off
from the outside world.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.878
I'll find him.
If he goes to leave,
he's going to hit a wall.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.881
Wasn't me.
I thought Zane was
my Secret Santa.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.550
Why would you think that?
Only someone who could
hack my computer

19:05.686 --> 19:09.224
would know I've been searching
the internet for years
looking for this.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.646
Steve Austin.
Better. Stronger. Faster.

19:15.863 --> 19:16.852
Seriously?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.730
It's authentic.
Original hinges,
not a chip on it.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.949
You have no idea how rare.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.864
Okay, well, it wasn't Zane.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.113
Well, then someone was
thinking of me,
and I'm going to find him.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.864
So you can thank him?

19:29.001 --> 19:32.334
So I can suspend him.
No one hacks Fargo
and gets away with it.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.623
Not even Santa.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.254
Okay.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.669
Hello, Fargo.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.887
Hi, Steve Austin.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.181
(IMITATING SOUND EFFECT)

19:48.813 --> 19:49.973
Wow.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.358
ALLISON: The crystal is safe
in our largest
containment lab.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.853
But I'd say
it's still growing.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.607
HENRY: What we need
to do now is calculate
the expansion rate.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.362
ALLISON: Right.
So we can figure out

20:04.495 --> 20:06.736
how much time we have
before it outgrows this lab.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.831
This image represents the
density of electrons within
the crystal 10 minutes ago.

20:10.960 --> 20:11.949
Anything unusual?

20:12.086 --> 20:15.874
No, but we'll know more
once I do another diffraction
scan as a comparison.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.967
I don't care if we're on
a wild goose chase looking
for this missing scientist.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.757
At least it's time away
from that party.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.140
You're not feeling
the merry, huh?

20:25.266 --> 20:28.383
(SCOFFS) All the boozing
and schmoozing,
lights and glitter.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.055
It's Vegas,
not Christmas.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.724
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,
I wish I was home.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.563
It's beautiful, Carter,
I'm all misty.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.391
You know what, Jo,
you got a heart of stone.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.401
Bah, humbug.
That's me.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.940
CARTER: Wow.

20:44.618 --> 20:48.406
They look the same.
Yeah, the intermolecular
spacing is identical.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.706
ALLISON: Henry, What if...

20:53.002 --> 20:54.037
Oh.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.835
So the crystal
hasn't changed.
No.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.500
(PHONE BEEPING)

21:00.092 --> 21:02.174
Yeah?
CARTER: Henry, we're
at the edge of town,

21:05.514 --> 21:08.130
and something else
has gotten way big.

21:11.854 --> 21:15.142
Well, no, it hasn't
gotten bigger.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.940
We've gotten smaller.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.410
Dun dun duh!

21:33.793 --> 21:36.205
So, what?
The whole town
was shrinking?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.620
Oh, I'm telling it
how it happened.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.754
GIRL: Even though
it's totally bogus.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.957
(LAUGHING)

21:45.805 --> 21:48.638
All right, I'll let you guys
go back to playing
your video games.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.257
I won't waste
anymore of your time.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.847
Well, wait, I mean,
you may as well just finish
the rest of the story.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.516
BOY 2: Please, Sheriff Carter.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.398
All right.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.859
So, after we left the sign,

22:10.788 --> 22:12.870
we went back
to Global Dynamics.

22:15.292 --> 22:20.082
We and everything contained
in the EM. shield
are getting smaller.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.379
Why isn't the crystal
shrinking?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.169
VVeH,because
it's one of the strongest

22:24.301 --> 22:26.678
Bravais lattice
atomic structures
in the universe.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.469
It's almost impossible
to alter or compress.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.135
But we get to shrink
into microscopic dots
of nothingness.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.850
And as everything in Eureka
gets smaller,

22:34.979 --> 22:38.346
the energy required
to compress radiates heat.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.858
Is that why it's like
a billion degrees in here?

22:39.984 --> 22:41.349
Yes. And why
we've been so hungry.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.521
Our metabolism's
working overtime.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.144
So what now?

22:45.614 --> 22:47.024
Maybe someone
outside of Eureka

22:47.157 --> 22:49.409
will see how small we are
and try to help us.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.366
Oh, like a
big—hearted elephant?

22:51.495 --> 22:54.953
The roads closed, and nothing
is getting through
that E.M. shield.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.323
It's a pretty
bleak Christmas.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.542
(SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROL)

23:00.671 --> 23:02.161
You must stop!

23:03.799 --> 23:04.788
What's causing
the shrinkage?

23:04.925 --> 23:09.043
Yeah, I don't want to die
a miniature, though adorable,
version of myself.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.547
CARTER: A miniature...
Taggan.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.555
Let's go!

23:14.685 --> 23:17.677

Taggan?

23:34.038 --> 23:35.369
(GASPS)

23:37.458 --> 23:39.414
Ha! It works.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.754
Get me down.

23:43.881 --> 23:44.870
(GRUNTS)

23:46.550 --> 23:49.838
Of course,

a lot more paunch.

to widen the net.

He's my white
bearded whale.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.939
F.Y.I., that didn't
turn out very well
for either one of them.

24:04.401 --> 24:08.360
Now, the present you gave me,
the M—tracking, shifting...

24:08.489 --> 24:10.070
Oh, good things come
in small packages.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.315
No, it's a big mess.
The whole town is shrinking.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.440
(CHUCKLES)

24:15.955 --> 24:18.037
You're joking.
Does this look like
my joking face?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.952
My device can't be
responsible.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.584
Well, are you kidding me?
Look where you live, a device
is always responsible.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.830
The molecular transfer field
is very precise.

24:29.343 --> 24:33.837
Atoms shift from our dimension
in space—time to another.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.766
Leaving us with this.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.816
See? Tip top.
It's not my device.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.402
(BEEPING)

24:50.864 --> 24:52.570
That can't be good.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.944
The transfer field's
expanded beyond
the target area.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.413
Expanded by how much?

25:01.542 --> 25:02.782
Oh, roughly, um,

25:04.503 --> 25:05.618
the whole town.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.582
Eureka's getting smaller
by the minute.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.131
It looks like the only thing
containing the miniaturization
effect

25:14.263 --> 25:16.675
is the EM. shield.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.640
And the EM. shield
is a big sparking mess
right now.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.100
I don't understand.

25:22.980 --> 25:28.191
Unless it tried to miniaturize
an item so dense it overtaxed
the containment unit.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.308
Unless it tried to miniaturize
an item so dense it overtaxed
the containment unit.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.857
But I was very careful
to avoid unusually
dense material.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.824
Unusually dense,
like this?

25:50.591 --> 25:52.707
Fruit cake?
I beg your pardon?

25:52.843 --> 25:54.754
You used Taggart's shrinking
machine, didn't you?

25:55.179 --> 25:58.888
(STAMMERING) I'm sure
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.426
Oh, really?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.766
Hi. Those little pieces
aren't pieces at all,
are they?

26:02.895 --> 26:05.477

a fruit cake that wouldn't
be the object of ridicule.

such a bad rap, Sheriff!

Mmm. Keep talking.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.791
Well, I re—shrunk each cake
about a half a dozen times.

26:28.378 --> 26:32.087
It's the only way to maximize
the fruity, nutty goodness
that is fruit cake.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.086
Why are you looking
at me like that?
No reason.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.421
I'm so sorry, Sheriff.

Yeah, you'd think.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.875
Uh, hey everybody,
can I have your attention?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.714
I need you stay inside

Doctor Drummer,
where have you been?

28:12.274 --> 28:15.766
Enjoying the party.
You missed out.
There was fruit cake.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.810
I'm aware. Thanks.

28:18.780 --> 28:19.815
Candy cane?

28:21.450 --> 28:24.988
No, thank you. Look, there's
a serious situation with your

28:25.495 --> 28:27.781

28:27.915 --> 28:29.451
I told you it had

You were right,
and now you have
to fix it.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.835
I know.
Okay.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.164
When did you stop
liking candy canes?
Do you remember?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.835
When I had to grow up.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.096
I know the holidays can be

Can we go now?

28:53.482 --> 28:56.189
Sure.
After you, Josephina.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.406
If you can't shrink
your crystal, Doctor Drummer,

29:11.541 --> 29:14.749
it's gonna blow
our little bits
into little bits.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.706
Have faith, Doctor Taggart.

29:16.838 --> 29:17.873
Once we boost the power,

29:18.006 --> 29:19.382
your device should be
very effective.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.379
But even if we shrink
the crystal, we still have
to un—shrink us.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.210
You'll figure
out a way, Henry.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.427

are you giving this?

29:36.984 --> 29:38.690

Better double it.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.730
Focused energy is the key.

29:40.862 --> 29:45.356
You know, your crystal's
electron density
is very unusual.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.528
I mean, even
for crystallized hydrogen.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.867
Mmm—hmm.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.493
It has an extra element
that makes it unique.

29:55.085 --> 29:58.498
Doctor Drummer,
there shouldn't be
secrets in science.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.833
Oh, it shouldn't always
be about science.

that you're miserable

You're making four
different kinds of pies.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.812
You know, it's because
I've never had what you have.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.066
What I have?

31:04.196 --> 31:07.233
I love how your family
gets together to celebrate.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.981
Oh.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.905
I grew up with a more
practical version
of the holiday.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.661
Practical doesn't sound fun.

31:15.791 --> 31:16.871
No.

31:18.377 --> 31:22.666
My parents,
they're wonderful, but...

31:24.132 --> 31:28.501
Well, they're scientists,
so they put their faith
in hard facts.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.757
So yeah,
I got presents, but
they weren't from Santa

31:31.890 --> 31:34.802
because my parents
told me that he wasn't real
and...

31:36.436 --> 31:40.896
My gifts, they were never
wrapped because,
well, that's a waste of paper.

31:42.943 --> 31:43.932
Ah.

31:44.820 --> 31:49.780
So, I know that it sounds
silly but I want my kids
to have what I missed.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.240
I want the magic.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.820
So I do too much.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.328
I think you do it right.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.835
Thanks.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.670
This procedure is very risky.
We have to shrink the crystal
without making it explode.

32:13.807 --> 32:18.096
Or we could have
a front row seat for a new
inflationary epoch.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.516
Hmm...
A few moments after
the Big Bang,

32:21.648 --> 32:24.606
the universe undenNent
an extremely rapid expansion.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.857
Well, isn't expansion
what we're trying to do to us?

32:31.324 --> 32:33.736
That's right.
We need to make it
explode,

32:33.869 --> 32:35.985
that way we reverse
the dimensional shunting...

32:36.121 --> 32:37.531
Make us big again.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.074
But we can't
blow it up here.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.947
The energy release
will be massive.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.699
But, no, no, no, no.
If we shrink the crystal,

32:42.836 --> 32:44.997
and then detonate it
at the highest point
of the EM. shield,

32:45.130 --> 32:46.711
it'll be like throwing up
a live grenade.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.796
First we need to see
if she gets any smaller.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.843
Fingers crossed.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.797
Make a Christmas

33:06.318 --> 33:08.604
All right, let's get
this puppy airborne!

33:08.737 --> 33:10.068
Before the puppy explodes.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.562
That's going to be
a problem.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.485
Heat plus shrinking equals
not so healthy for
our helicopters.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.324
The rotors are
completely warped.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.114
Of course.
Now we have no way
to transport it.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.703
Well, there is
one way, mate.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.415
But I'll need
a little helper.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.665

are presented with

41:05.797 --> 41:07.537
unique challenges.

41:08.424 --> 41:12.042
But today, let's
remember and rejoice

41:12.178 --> 41:14.760
at how wonderful
it is to be alive,

41:15.223 --> 41:18.181
and how lucky
we are to be together.

41:18.768 --> 41:19.928
Here, here.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.597
ALL: Cheers.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.769
What is that?

41:26.234 --> 41:28.600
I don't know.
You better open it.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.790
ZOE: What do you think?

41:47.588 --> 41:49.249
It's perfect.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.843
You know, we could probably
make it home if you still
want to go.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.051
We are home.

42:04.397 --> 42:07.059
Merry Christmas, Dad.
Merry Christmas.
