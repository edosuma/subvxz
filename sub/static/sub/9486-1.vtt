in love with hip-hop,

when cats first started

01:31.424 --> 01:33.722
going out to the parks,
you know,

01:33.793 --> 01:35.226
with the 2 turntables,
the mic.

01:35.294 --> 01:36.693
I think it was 1977.

01:36.762 --> 01:38.286
People are rocking
in the parks.

01:38.364 --> 01:42.164
I can remember
back in the Bronx, 1979.

in front of the building.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.594

getting the power

It was just like our
way of expression.

02:12.531 --> 02:15.125

directly to me because,

you know, it was speaking
from the language

02:17.036 --> 02:18.867

10:15.680 --> 10:16.977

to get this night off.

10:17.048 --> 10:19.676
I'm about to have a ball.
You should, too.

10:19.751 --> 10:22.879

10:26.591 --> 10:28.786
See? See, this is
why I don't date.

10:28.860 --> 10:29.884
Only guys I meet are
in the industry,

10:29.961 --> 10:32.293

it wasn't too bad.

No, and you look great.

But I can't compete with
you in that dress.

are wearing that dress.

Do you hear
something, Sidney?

like a male ego.

That's real funny.

Amazing?

Mm-hmm.

That's not a word

to describe
one of your women.

12:31.082 --> 12:33.073
Oh, she ain't like
any of the others.

5 minutes.

little job I have

14:19.490 --> 14:20.718
at this little
magazine.

14:20.792 --> 14:24.523
Besides, there's order
in this chaos.

14:24.595 --> 14:27.621
I know where everything is
and where everything goes.

14:27.698 --> 14:31.566
So, uh, where does
this go? Ooh!

14:31.636 --> 14:33.536

from Brookstone.

like I don't know...

14:37.075 --> 14:38.303

of your time.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.252
you never thought
about hooking up?

14:57.328 --> 15:01.594
Dre asked me once
when I was at Columbia

15:01.666 --> 15:03.657
if we should try being
more than just friends,

15:03.734 --> 15:07.295

No?! What is wrong
with you, girl?

15:10.975 --> 15:13.000
I mean, we've been through
everything together.

15:13.077 --> 15:14.772
Exactly. So if
you two hook up,

15:14.846 --> 15:16.643
you get the best
of both worlds.

and the booty.

talk to each other again.

I mean, you're divorced.

all the time.

about alimony,

more than a month.

looks like

15:39.137 --> 15:40.536

keep this one.

shower thingy,

what to bring.

changed a bit.

something up for you?

would you?

I got you covered.

cousin in the world.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.274
of their dresses.

19:41.345 --> 19:43.711
I like
to refer to them

19:43.780 --> 19:45.543
as the Cyndi Lauper
honeys.

19:45.616 --> 19:48.244
They just like
to have fun.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.512
Don't get it
twisted.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.451
I'll tap that
as well.

19:51.522 --> 19:53.547
Oh, I forgot being
best friends with a man

19:53.624 --> 19:54.921
means I get to find out
the stupid and simple

19:54.992 --> 19:56.254
ways they look at women.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.624
Well, that's how men are,
stupid and simple.

19:58.695 --> 20:00.663
See, that's the problem
with y'all women.

20:00.731 --> 20:03.894
You... You're all
too complicated.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.525
You keep trying to
change every man

20:05.602 --> 20:06.591
into
the marrying type,

20:06.670 --> 20:07.830
and you just
can't do it.

20:07.905 --> 20:09.668
Well, I guess Reese
did a good number on you.

20:09.740 --> 20:13.267
Ooh, touché, touché,
touché.

20:13.343 --> 20:15.743
And tell me, then...

20:15.812 --> 20:18.610
Dreski,
what type am I?

20:18.682 --> 20:21.480
You could probably
be in a video.

20:21.552 --> 20:23.884
- Do this.
- Dre...

20:23.954 --> 20:26.149
- Do this.
- Dre!

20:26.223 --> 20:28.282
[Beatboxing]

20:28.358 --> 20:31.191
Dre.

20:31.261 --> 20:33.559
[Huffs]

20:33.630 --> 20:35.495
What do you think
about this for the mantle?

20:35.566 --> 20:38.160
That sounds so cool.
I never had a mantle before.

20:38.235 --> 20:40.965
It's cute. It's not
really you, though.

20:41.038 --> 20:43.006
Now this is tight.

20:43.073 --> 20:44.438
Oh, couples love
that piece

20:44.508 --> 20:45.998
because it's not
too masculine,

20:46.076 --> 20:47.475
it's not
too feminine.

20:47.544 --> 20:49.478
I like to call it
a compromising piece.

20:49.546 --> 20:52.140
Let me guess.
Newlyweds, right?

20:52.215 --> 20:54.115
No, we just...

20:54.184 --> 20:56.778
Pu-lease, we are
just friends, that's it.

20:56.853 --> 20:58.115
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

20:58.188 --> 21:00.247
I just thought, um...

21:00.324 --> 21:01.689
Well, if you need
any help

21:01.758 --> 21:05.751
finding friend things
just ask. Mm-hmm.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.763
Why you have to
say it like that?

21:07.831 --> 21:09.594
Say what?

21:09.666 --> 21:11.827
Pu-lease.
Like I ain't shit.

21:11.902 --> 21:13.733
'Cause you ain't.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.805
Oh, damn it, see.

21:15.872 --> 21:18.238
I forgot. I'm supposed
to check out

21:18.308 --> 21:20.799
this MC I want
to sign tonight.

21:20.877 --> 21:22.538
What jail
or group home

21:22.613 --> 21:23.739
does Simon have you
going to now?

21:23.814 --> 21:25.042
Oh, that's funny.

21:25.115 --> 21:28.050
It's open mic night
at Webster Hall.

21:28.118 --> 21:29.813
What you doing tonight?

21:29.886 --> 21:32.047
Oh, I can't, Dre.

21:32.122 --> 21:33.612
Aw, come on, Sid.

21:33.690 --> 21:35.555
You remember how
we used to do it.

21:35.626 --> 21:37.560
Club to club,
up all night,

21:37.628 --> 21:39.596
eggs and bologna
in the morning. Come on.

21:39.663 --> 21:40.687
I can't
hang like that.

21:40.764 --> 21:41.856
I gotta get up
in the morning.

21:41.932 --> 21:43.331
All right, we'll
bump the eggs and bologna.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.868
You can do it.
You got it in you.

21:45.936 --> 21:48.461
What? Hear the music.
Unh, unh, unh.

21:48.538 --> 21:50.403
# No eggs, unh, unh, unh #

21:50.474 --> 21:51.736
# No bologna,

21:51.808 --> 21:52.740
Ok.

21:52.809 --> 21:53.901
Just dancing.

21:53.977 --> 21:55.171
Ok, stop it!

21:55.245 --> 21:58.408
# Cavi is my name but you
can call me Cav #

21:58.482 --> 22:00.143
# It's all the same
abbreviated or whole #

22:00.217 --> 22:02.879
# Shout it out
so it don't be a secret #

22:02.953 --> 22:04.545
# It goes Cav,
short for Cavi #

22:04.621 --> 22:05.883
# But I'm not from Cali #

22:05.956 --> 22:07.253
# I'm from
the rotten Apple #

22:19.302 --> 22:22.066
#Ain't a crowd in the world

22:22.139 --> 22:24.539
#A hot doom, cats thinking
it's not true #

22:24.608 --> 22:26.041
#You come front row
to the show #

22:26.109 --> 22:27.440
# I got proof #

22:27.511 --> 22:30.002

22:30.080 --> 22:32.605
#To selling Spoonie Gee
to the fiends to nod to #

22:32.683 --> 22:35.208
# Got sent upstate

# In my vault thinking #

22:36.486 --> 22:37.953
# Man, should've
listen to ma, too #

22:38.021 --> 22:40.353
# Came home in '99,

22:40.424 --> 22:43.860
# I don't move bundles,
I got a new hustle #

22:43.927 --> 22:45.952
# I quit pie making
and starting rhyme making #

22:46.029 --> 22:48.589
# Building up my name till
I'm one of the 5 greatest #

22:48.665 --> 22:51.361
#And I ain't saying Cav

#And I'm gonna need
a few moments #

#JJust to get in your ear #

23:03.847 --> 23:05.041
# Don't be scared #

#When they ask

# It's over here #

#And then I'm gone #

23:36.045 --> 23:37.342
I don't want
to look too anxious.

23:37.413 --> 23:38.607
Do I look anxious?

23:38.681 --> 23:39.613
Yeah, you look
real anxious.

23:39.682 --> 23:40.649
Tell me
when he comes.

23:40.717 --> 23:41.775
He's right here.

23:41.851 --> 23:43.443
What?

23:45.888 --> 23:49.221
Hey, I'm Dre Ellis.
This is Sidney Shaw.

23:49.292 --> 23:50.350
Hey.

23:50.426 --> 23:51.393
I'm from Millenium
Records.

23:51.461 --> 23:52.621
Wondering
if you were signed.

23:52.695 --> 23:53.992
Uh, no,
not right now.

23:54.063 --> 23:55.155
Nobody caught you yet?

23:55.231 --> 23:56.357
Hey, you doing me
dirt, man.

23:56.432 --> 23:59.868
What's the deal?
I see you.

23:59.936 --> 24:01.927
Why don't you take
this man, give me a call.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.836
You really rip it
on stage.

24:03.906 --> 24:05.168
I remember you, man.

24:05.241 --> 24:06.401
You used to, um,
you used to

24:06.476 --> 24:07.966
hang up posters
for DefJJam.

24:08.044 --> 24:10.308
Yeah. Ha!
That's right.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.711
You got
a good memory, man.

24:11.781 --> 24:13.146
That was back in the day,
that was back in the day.

24:13.216 --> 24:14.581
Yeah, yeah.

24:14.651 --> 24:15.845
Seriously, though, we're trying
to do some big things with you.

24:15.918 --> 24:17.943
We're looking for artists
of your caliber. What's up?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.852
Why don't you take that

24:19.922 --> 24:22.186
and then shout me out
real quick.

24:22.258 --> 24:23.452
You want to
sign me for pennies

24:23.526 --> 24:25.221
and sell my publishing
for millions?

24:25.294 --> 24:27.455
Oh, that's funny.
You got jokes.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.588
For real, though,

24:28.665 --> 24:29.723
you're looking for
a deal, probably, right?

24:29.799 --> 24:31.824
Why don't you take...
Can I put this anywhere?

24:31.901 --> 24:33.869
Well, all right,
but listen,

24:33.936 --> 24:35.631
to be honest
with you, man,

24:35.705 --> 24:36.637
I'm not sure
Millenium

24:36.706 --> 24:38.435
is really ready
for what I'm doing.

24:38.508 --> 24:39.532
It's on a different
tip, you know.

24:39.609 --> 24:40.633
I've seen some
of your artists.

24:40.710 --> 24:41.677
No dis.

24:41.744 --> 24:42.836
Oh, that's cool, man.

24:42.912 --> 24:44.539
We're trying to, you know,
broaden our horizons.

24:44.614 --> 24:46.047
But I know
where you're at, man.

24:46.115 --> 24:47.047
I'll get at you, man.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.140
I know
where Millenium at.

24:48.217 --> 24:49.241
I know where
the office is at.

24:49.318 --> 24:50.444
Thanks for coming, man.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.283
I'm glad you felt it,
man, all right?

24:52.355 --> 24:53.982

all right.

we're Ren and Ten.

25:01.931 --> 25:02.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's going on?

25:02.999 --> 25:04.398
How you doing, brother?
My name is Ren...

25:04.467 --> 25:05.832
No, no,
we decided I'm Ren.

25:05.902 --> 25:06.834
All right,
whatever, man.

25:06.903 --> 25:07.835
The Hip-hop Dalmatians,

25:07.904 --> 25:08.836
you understand
what I'm saying?

25:08.905 --> 25:09.837
Yo, you get it?

25:09.906 --> 25:10.930
White
with black spots.

25:11.007 --> 25:11.996
You know
what I'm saying?

25:12.075 --> 25:14.043
Like, we represent
that whole unity thing.

25:14.110 --> 25:16.840
You know, like one unit.
U-N-l-T.

25:16.913 --> 25:17.845
- Why?
- Because.

25:17.914 --> 25:18.881
- Right.
- Thank you.

25:18.948 --> 25:20.347
I like that.
Now, let's go.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.145
I'm doing some talking
about the schematics

25:22.218 --> 25:23.879
for the album cover, ok?

25:23.953 --> 25:26.148
What we seeing is this.
I'm gonna be standing there,

25:26.222 --> 25:28.918
right, we gonna have
101 dalmatians around.

25:28.991 --> 25:30.185
All around, all around...
boom...

25:30.259 --> 25:31.749
And I'm gonna have
a white fur coat

25:31.828 --> 25:33.386
with black spots.

25:33.463 --> 25:34.623
It's gonna be
chinchillin'.

25:34.697 --> 25:36.221
I'm gonna rock
a black fur coat

25:36.299 --> 25:38.699
with white spots,
you know what I'm saying?

25:38.768 --> 25:39.700
- We flip it on.
- Boom.

25:39.769 --> 25:41.031
Like, the audience,
they like, "what?"

25:41.104 --> 25:43.538
They don't know.
They're kinda confused

25:43.606 --> 25:45.267
'cause we do one thing,

25:45.341 --> 25:47.400
we go 160 degrees
to the other side.

25:47.477 --> 25:48.444
160 degrees?

25:48.511 --> 25:50.911

Stimpy?

25:50.980 --> 25:52.106

25:52.181 --> 25:54.911
Dre: Rin Tin Tin... Rin...
What can I do for you?

25:54.984 --> 25:56.611
All right, Dre...

25:56.686 --> 25:59.154
it's Ren and Ten.

26:04.026 --> 26:05.220

26:05.294 --> 26:06.226
He don't know,

26:06.295 --> 26:07.762
Let him know.

26:07.830 --> 26:08.956
I'm gonna tell you,
dun sun.

26:09.031 --> 26:10.726
We your new group,
dun sun!

26:10.800 --> 26:13.394
Oh! We just signed
to Millenium yesterday!

26:13.469 --> 26:15.994
- Right?
- In your area.

26:16.072 --> 26:18.404
2002, sun.
Ren and Ten.

26:18.474 --> 26:20.999
Look out, world.
What's that about?

26:21.077 --> 26:22.772
What's gonna happen now?

26:22.845 --> 26:24.779
We're gonna take it
all over, you and me.

26:24.847 --> 26:25.779
I mean and him, too.

26:29.352 --> 26:31.286
[Simon Chatting
With Secretary]

26:36.492 --> 26:38.255
Hey, Dre.
Thank you, baby.

26:38.327 --> 26:41.194
Um, did you sign a new act
without consulting me?

26:41.264 --> 26:43.255
Dre, I saw 'em
and I had to sign 'em.

26:43.332 --> 26:44.264
I had never seen
no shit like that.

26:44.333 --> 26:47.461
A black and white
rapping duo.

26:47.537 --> 26:49.129
I know they gonna hit.

26:49.205 --> 26:50.433
Come on, man.
You know that's just a gimmick.

26:50.506 --> 26:52.940
I mean, these guys
they have, like, no skills.

26:53.009 --> 26:54.533
They're just
straight up wack.

26:54.610 --> 26:57.875
Now I saw, last night,
a real MC.

26:57.947 --> 26:59.710
This cat deserves a shot.

26:59.782 --> 27:02.808
He came with the real original,
real, real hip-hop.

27:02.885 --> 27:04.477
I don't give a damn.
I'm trying to sell records

27:04.554 --> 27:06.317
to people
who'll actually buy them.

27:06.389 --> 27:07.549
So I need a group
who is gonna be able

27:07.623 --> 27:10.615
to get me
that MTV rotation, baby.

27:10.693 --> 27:11.625
Now, Ben and Ken...

28:36.012 --> 28:37.036

28:37.113 --> 28:39.775
You know what?
I was thinking

28:39.849 --> 28:43.285
about yesterday...
when I got my hat

28:43.352 --> 28:45.582
handed to me
by that MC...

28:45.655 --> 28:48.590
And I realized that I'm
the character you're writing on

28:48.658 --> 28:50.285
when you say that hip-hop
has lost its way.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.259
Dre, I was talking
in general terms.

28:52.328 --> 28:55.320
Sid, I could... I could feel
that look of yours

28:55.398 --> 28:56.956

to leave Millenium.

my high-minded speech

29:02.538 --> 29:03.869
and just bounce.

29:05.875 --> 29:08.400
Then I started thinking
about the money,

29:08.477 --> 29:12.607

the suits...

29:15.751 --> 29:16.843
and I punked out.

29:16.919 --> 29:18.819
You didn't punk out.

29:18.888 --> 29:20.913
Well, you gotta admit,
I punked out a little bit.

Not even a little bite-sized,

not in your hand" punk out?

bite-sized punk out.

a little in our careers.

the business.

29:35.104 --> 29:38.039
Why did it all get
so complicated?

29:38.107 --> 29:39.768
I mean, all I wanted
to do was make music,

29:39.842 --> 29:42.208
and now
I'm not doing that.

29:42.278 --> 29:46.442

is making deals

is shady.

46:47.734 --> 46:48.826
The first time?

46:48.901 --> 46:50.232
Yup.

46:50.303 --> 46:51.361
That was real.

46:51.437 --> 46:53.496
Ooh, or, um...
You Gots To Chill.

46:53.573 --> 46:55.666
The sophomore skate party?

46:58.745 --> 47:00.736
Bonita Applebum.
That was a tight one.

47:00.813 --> 47:01.871
Mm-mmm.

47:01.948 --> 47:04.439
And Paul Revere.
Ooh, I used to loved that.

47:04.517 --> 47:06.508
See, now that beat
was tight.

47:06.586 --> 47:07.518
The Beastie Boys.

47:07.587 --> 47:09.316
Yeah, man,
they came with it.

47:09.389 --> 47:10.515
Mm-hmm.

47:10.590 --> 47:12.785
You know...

47:12.859 --> 47:15.453
I don't have
that feeling no more.

47:15.528 --> 47:16.995
You know
what I'm saying?

47:19.799 --> 47:20.857
I cannot remember
the last time

47:20.933 --> 47:23.401
I had that feeling.

47:23.469 --> 47:25.801
I can't...
I can't...

47:25.872 --> 47:28.534
You ready to talk?
What's on your mind?

47:35.481 --> 47:37.847
I quit today, Sid.

47:39.552 --> 47:41.986
I left Millenium.

47:42.055 --> 47:48.893
I just walked away
from it all today.

47:48.961 --> 47:51.225
So, whatcha
gonna do now?

47:55.168 --> 47:57.636
I'm thinking...

47:57.703 --> 47:59.933
I'm thinking I could
start my own label.

48:00.006 --> 48:02.600
You know? Yeah.

48:02.675 --> 48:04.575
Um, you know,
make music

48:04.644 --> 48:06.134
that I want to make.

48:06.212 --> 48:08.180
Music that I think
should be out there.

48:08.247 --> 48:09.179
You know
what I mean?

48:09.248 --> 48:10.180
Bring on artists

48:10.249 --> 48:12.774
and treat 'em
like partners.

48:12.852 --> 48:15.582
Make my money
the right way.

48:15.655 --> 48:17.418
Shoot.

48:17.490 --> 48:20.687
Be one of the good
guys for a change.

48:22.028 --> 48:23.620
You think I'm crazy?

48:24.997 --> 48:26.328
I think you're the bomb.

48:26.399 --> 48:28.560
For real?

48:28.634 --> 48:29.566
I think
you're the bomb.

48:29.635 --> 48:31.694
- For real-real?
- Yes.

48:31.771 --> 48:35.172
Damn.
That's great, Dre.

48:35.241 --> 48:36.640
I can already see us
at the Grammys,

48:36.709 --> 48:39.041
basking in your success.

48:39.112 --> 48:41.080
Oh, I like
how that sounds.

48:41.147 --> 48:42.774
The Grammys.

48:42.849 --> 48:46.307
Damn, Dre,
that's great.

48:46.385 --> 48:49.718
I'm scared, Sid.

48:49.789 --> 48:53.156
So, how...
how are you going to...

48:53.226 --> 48:54.989
You got the money?

48:55.061 --> 48:57.529
Uh, I mean, I got
a little something...

48:57.597 --> 48:59.462
A little
something saved.

48:59.532 --> 49:02.660
I'm gonna have to hit up
other sources, but...

49:02.735 --> 49:04.930
you know, I ain't gonna
really stress about that.

49:05.004 --> 49:07.165
That's the last thing

49:07.240 --> 49:08.832
I need to be
worrying about now.

49:08.908 --> 49:11.843
I'm gonna start out
with one artist...

49:11.911 --> 49:14.436
What you doing?

49:14.514 --> 49:15.879
You just found
another source.

49:17.216 --> 49:19.582
Sid, stop playing.
I ain't...

49:19.652 --> 49:20.619
Take it.

49:20.686 --> 49:22.551
No, I'm not taking
that money from you.

49:22.622 --> 49:23.987
Come on.

49:24.056 --> 49:26.490
Look, you are
my best friend.

49:26.559 --> 49:27.924
There's nobody
that believes in you

49:27.994 --> 49:30.155
more than me.
So you're taking this check,

49:30.229 --> 49:32.197
you're starting
that label

49:32.265 --> 49:34.290
and it's gonna be hot.

49:37.870 --> 49:40.805
[Church Bell Chiming]

49:42.909 --> 49:45.605
All right, girl.

49:45.678 --> 49:47.305
[Sighs]

49:47.380 --> 49:48.347
Ow!

49:48.414 --> 49:52.145
I can't believe you
sometimes.

49:52.218 --> 49:54.914
Whoo! So what you
doing tonight?

49:54.987 --> 49:56.386
We gonna celebrate
or what?

49:56.455 --> 49:59.185
I can't, I have...
I have a date.

50:01.794 --> 50:04.786
Oh, with Kelby?
Yeah.

50:04.864 --> 50:06.593
So you said
yes, huh?

50:06.666 --> 50:08.099
What's
this cat's number

50:08.167 --> 50:09.099
'cause I'm gonna
call him up

50:09.168 --> 50:10.100
and cancel for you

50:10.169 --> 50:11.568
'cause you hanging
with me tonight.

50:11.637 --> 50:12.661
- Uh-uh.
- For real.

50:12.738 --> 50:14.399
I got to go.

50:16.275 --> 50:17.799
It's like that?

50:17.877 --> 50:19.276
Just put the money
on the nightstand

50:19.345 --> 50:21.506
and bounce?

50:21.581 --> 50:22.707
Leave a brother
hanging?

50:22.782 --> 50:23.908
Bye, Dre.

50:23.983 --> 50:25.450
No kissing
on the first date.

50:25.518 --> 50:27.110
Bye, Dre.

50:27.186 --> 50:28.676
Sidney, Narrating:
Just when you think you know

50:28.754 --> 50:30.346
everything there is
to know about hip-hop

50:30.423 --> 50:32.050
it finds a way
to surprise you

50:32.124 --> 50:33.819
and remind you
why you fell in love

50:33.893 --> 50:35.588
in the first place.

50:38.197 --> 50:39.323
Good evening,
Miss Shaw.

50:39.398 --> 50:41.491
Welcome
to Chingalle's.

50:41.567 --> 50:42.499
How'd you know
my name?

50:42.568 --> 50:44.035
Please, this way.

50:51.877 --> 50:53.742
Sidney: Oh, my goodness.

50:53.813 --> 50:55.144
Thank you.

50:57.183 --> 50:58.514
Thank you,
Jarmelle.

50:59.986 --> 51:01.613
Perfect 10s.

51:03.623 --> 51:04.612
Thank you.

51:06.559 --> 51:07.651
Whoa, whoa, easy.

51:07.727 --> 51:08.921
[Laughs]

51:11.230 --> 51:12.993
Thank you.

51:13.065 --> 51:14.157
I'll be right back.

51:14.233 --> 51:15.222
Ok.

51:29.482 --> 51:31.074
Hey, Reesey-piecey.

51:32.285 --> 51:33.343
Hi, baby.

51:33.419 --> 51:35.387
How you doing?

51:35.454 --> 51:36.546
How was your day?

51:36.622 --> 51:37.987
Interesting.

51:42.828 --> 51:44.056
Oh.

51:44.130 --> 51:45.097
I forgot.

51:45.164 --> 51:46.324
I took your phone again.

51:46.399 --> 51:48.993
Oh! Yeah, I know. I kept
getting phone calls

51:49.068 --> 51:50.296
from all
your ex-girlfriends.

51:51.671 --> 51:52.729
Here.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.102
Thank you, baby.

51:55.174 --> 51:57.005
Baby...

51:57.076 --> 51:58.338
Mmm?

51:58.411 --> 52:01.380
Mmm...

52:01.447 --> 52:05.178
I love you...

52:05.251 --> 52:07.151
and, uh, ahem...

52:08.354 --> 52:10.345
I quit my job today.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.021
Why?

52:15.094 --> 52:16.823
[Sighs] 'Cause,
baby, I just...

52:16.896 --> 52:17.863
I needed to.

52:17.930 --> 52:19.227
I had to. L...

52:19.298 --> 52:20.265
[Sighs]

52:20.333 --> 52:21.994
I'm gonna start
my own label.

52:22.068 --> 52:24.093
I'm gonna do
all the things

52:24.170 --> 52:25.501
that I've
ever wanted to do.

52:25.571 --> 52:27.368
I thought you were doing
all of that at Millenium.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.534
No, not at Millenium.
I wasn't.

52:30.609 --> 52:33.908
I mean, you know
how much I love music,

52:33.979 --> 52:35.482
how much I love hip-hop,

52:35.615 --> 52:36.479
- How it makes me feel,
- Dre...

52:36.549 --> 52:37.538
And I lost that love
at Millenium.

52:37.617 --> 52:38.845
How could you make
a change like this

52:38.918 --> 52:40.249
without consulting me?

52:40.320 --> 52:42.015
'Cause this is something
I had to do for me.

52:42.088 --> 52:43.817
Plus, I know
you would've just tried

52:43.890 --> 52:44.982
to talk me
out of it, and...

52:45.058 --> 52:46.150
It's not fair
for you to assume that.

52:46.226 --> 52:47.693
- You don't know that.
- Reese,

52:47.760 --> 52:49.591
you mean to tell me,
had I told you,

52:49.662 --> 52:51.061
you wouldn't have tried
to talk me out of it?

52:51.130 --> 52:52.825
Yes, I would have tried
to talk you out of it,

52:52.899 --> 52:54.093
but I'm supposed
to do that.

52:54.167 --> 52:55.156
You get so excited,

52:55.235 --> 52:56.361
and you don't
think straight,

52:56.436 --> 52:58.063
and then you do
something like this.

52:58.137 --> 52:59.695
You can't make
a major life decision

52:59.772 --> 53:00.704
just because
you feel like it...

53:00.773 --> 53:03.037
I don't need you
to be my lawyer!

53:08.081 --> 53:09.912
Reesey, I need you
to be my wife.

53:09.983 --> 53:11.883
And a husband is supposed
to consult his wife

53:11.951 --> 53:13.043
when he changes the plan.

53:13.119 --> 53:15.417
And a wife
supports her husband!

53:15.488 --> 53:17.979
Baby, I need
your support!

53:20.560 --> 53:22.585
Ok, fine.

53:24.764 --> 53:26.527
I support you.

53:26.599 --> 53:27.725
I'll call
some money people.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.165
We'll get this
squared away.

53:29.235 --> 53:30.702
That's all taken
care of. Uh...

53:30.770 --> 53:32.601
Sid said she'd help
out with some

53:32.672 --> 53:33.696
of the investing,
and...

53:33.773 --> 53:34.740
Sidney?

53:34.807 --> 53:36.741
Sidney knew
about this before me?

53:36.809 --> 53:38.470
Reesey, baby, please,
you know she's my friend...

53:38.545 --> 53:40.945
Your friend. [Claps] Ok.

53:41.014 --> 53:42.948
- Damn, Dre.
- Reese.

53:43.016 --> 53:44.278
Well, I see you have it
all under control.

53:44.350 --> 53:45.282
I'm really
happy for you.

53:45.351 --> 53:46.613
Who, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

53:46.686 --> 53:47.744
Slow your roll.

53:47.820 --> 53:48.787
Reesey! Reese!

53:48.855 --> 53:50.015
No, you slow
your roll.

53:50.089 --> 53:51.021
Reese!

53:51.090 --> 53:52.216
Dre?

53:52.292 --> 53:53.224
I'm fine.

53:53.293 --> 53:54.225
Sidney: You did
all right. [Laughs]

53:54.294 --> 53:55.318
Kelby:
Just all right. Ok.

53:55.395 --> 53:56.384
So... So, you're used

53:56.462 --> 53:57.895
to guys closing
down restaurants

53:57.964 --> 53:59.761
on their busiest
nights, huh?

53:59.832 --> 54:01.561
Commandeering
the kitchen,

54:01.634 --> 54:02.999
serving you
like a queen.

54:03.069 --> 54:04.536
You're used
to all that, huh?

54:04.604 --> 54:06.071
- You ballplayers.
- All right.

54:06.139 --> 54:07.299
I didn't think so.

54:07.373 --> 54:09.238
You think you're gonna
get some booty, don't you?

54:11.678 --> 54:12.610
Well, yeah.

54:12.679 --> 54:14.510
- Yeah?
- [Laughs]

54:14.581 --> 54:15.513
That's the plan.

54:15.582 --> 54:16.514
One of these days.

54:16.583 --> 54:18.278
Come on, that's what
this is all about.

54:18.351 --> 54:19.511
You know, the dating,

54:19.586 --> 54:20.644
the awkward walks home.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.119
That's what
men and women do.

54:22.188 --> 54:23.246
You got it all figured
out, don't you?

54:23.323 --> 54:24.688
I'm just tryin'
to be straight up.

54:24.757 --> 54:25.781
[Sighs]

54:25.858 --> 54:27.052
You put a man
and a woman

54:27.126 --> 54:28.753
together
long enough, and...

54:28.828 --> 54:30.318
something's
gonna go down.

54:30.396 --> 54:31.829
Well, what makes
you think you gonna be

54:31.898 --> 54:33.991
around long enough
for something to go down?

54:34.067 --> 54:36.729
Well, I think I got
a pretty good shot.

54:36.803 --> 54:37.929
It's not that good.

54:38.004 --> 54:39.995
Especially
outside 20 feet.

54:40.073 --> 54:42.337
And you could work on
that D a little, too.

54:42.408 --> 54:43.500
- Oh, really?
- Really.

54:43.576 --> 54:44.736
Ok.

54:44.811 --> 54:45.743
Come here.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.255
How was that shot?

54:57.323 --> 54:59.382
Nothin' but net.

54:59.459 --> 55:00.756
Dre: Vichon.
Chris Vichon.

55:00.827 --> 55:01.987
V-l-C-H-O-N.

55:02.061 --> 55:03.756
He's a driver.

55:03.830 --> 55:05.195
No, no, it's
not a complaint.

55:05.264 --> 55:06.731
He's a driver.

55:06.799 --> 55:08.528
Never mind. Thank you
for your time.

55:21.314 --> 55:24.442
[Telephone Rings]

55:24.517 --> 55:25.745
[Rings]

55:25.818 --> 55:26.750
Hello?

55:26.819 --> 55:29.083
Dre, Whispering:
Whassup?

55:29.155 --> 55:30.417
- Who is this?
- It's Dre.

55:30.490 --> 55:32.856
Dre? You do realize
the hour, right?

55:32.925 --> 55:33.983
Well, why you
whispering?

55:34.060 --> 55:35.186
Shh! Quiet.

55:35.261 --> 55:36.193
How was the date?

55:37.463 --> 55:40.557
- Good.
- "Good" like,

55:40.633 --> 55:42.032
"I had a great time,
but I gotta go"

55:42.101 --> 55:43.363
or "good" like,

55:43.436 --> 55:44.733
"I'm gonna stay
for dessert"?

55:44.804 --> 55:46.738
Good like,
I'll have dessert,

55:46.806 --> 55:48.501
a walk along the promenade,

55:48.574 --> 55:50.508
coffee,
which I'm making now.

55:50.576 --> 55:51.770
[Gasps] Sidney!

55:51.844 --> 55:52.970
Is he still there?

55:53.046 --> 55:54.013
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn!

55:54.080 --> 55:55.069
You must
like him a lot.

55:55.148 --> 55:57.514
Dre, the man
cooked for me.

55:57.583 --> 55:58.880
So? I cooked for you.

55:58.951 --> 56:01.749
Burnt fried bologna and eggs
hardly qualifies as cooking.

56:01.821 --> 56:02.753
I'm sayin', though,

56:02.822 --> 56:04.346
did you actually
see him cook for you?

You actually saw me
cook for you.

see him cook for you?

- No.
- Tsk...

56:08.795 --> 56:09.921

on you.

56:09.996 --> 56:11.520
That nigger
ain't cook for you!

56:11.597 --> 56:13.258
Dre, why would
he say it if he didn't?

56:13.332 --> 56:15.197
So he could get you
to make him coffee

56:15.268 --> 56:18.260
in the middle of the night
so he could tap that.

56:18.337 --> 56:20.305
I'm a dude.
I know these things.

56:20.373 --> 56:21.397
Well,

some Mother Goose raps?

"There was an old ho
that lived in a shoe."

No, I ain't lookin'
for that no more, man.

I'm lookin'
for some real stuff.

57:59.738 --> 58:02.036
I don't get you, man.

58:02.107 --> 58:04.371
One day

lookin' for the raw shit.

Well, what you got
goin' on, man? What?

between me and you, dog.

58:25.731 --> 58:27.096
But I ain't too proud
to ask for help.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.463
Maybe you should be
more proud.

'Cause your rep
is like this.

01:04:16.181 --> 01:04:17.273
Mmm!

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:19.385
[Laughs]

01:04:22.454 --> 01:04:24.388
More wings!
More crab cakes!

01:04:24.456 --> 01:04:26.617
All: Whoo! Yeah!

01:04:28.227 --> 01:04:29.455
All right, y'all.

01:04:29.528 --> 01:04:31.291
Hold up. I got
something to say.

01:04:31.363 --> 01:04:33.831
Since this is
the last meal

01:04:33.899 --> 01:04:34.923
uh, of the year,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.331
I would like
to propose a toast.

01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:37.391
Man: Hey. Yeah.

01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:39.164
Um, I'm a little...
little bit twisted,

01:04:39.238 --> 01:04:40.728
so... so don't
hold me responsible

01:04:40.806 --> 01:04:41.795
for anything
I might say.

01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:43.398
Yeah, but we won't
hold you sis-sponsible.

01:04:43.475 --> 01:04:44.965
[All Laugh]

01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:46.237
Dre: Anyway,

01:04:46.311 --> 01:04:48.302
this has been
a hell of a year,

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.472
as all of y'all know,

01:04:49.548 --> 01:04:51.413
full of ups and downs.
Um...

01:04:51.483 --> 01:04:54.145
for one, I married
this beautiful young woman

01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:56.346
beside me... mmm...

01:04:56.422 --> 01:04:57.719
Which is cool.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:59.985
But I also lost
my job at Millenium.

01:05:00.058 --> 01:05:00.990
No, no, bruh,
the job lost you.

01:05:01.059 --> 01:05:01.991
[Laughs] That's right!

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.084
Yeah, ok, I like that.

01:05:03.162 --> 01:05:04.925
I like that.
But because of it,

01:05:04.997 --> 01:05:07.659
l, um... I was able
to start my own label.

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:09.997
All, Clapping:
All right! Whoo!

01:05:11.336 --> 01:05:12.667
That took
a lot of courage.

01:05:12.738 --> 01:05:13.762
Thank you.

01:05:13.839 --> 01:05:15.204
I would like
to thank all of y'all

01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:17.037
for all
of y'all's support

01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:19.009
during this, uh...
this time.

01:05:19.077 --> 01:05:21.409
I would
especially... [sighs]

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.175
like to thank
my best friend,

01:05:23.248 --> 01:05:26.342
who, uh, left
that 75-degree weather

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:28.147
to come back home.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.246
You are the perfect verse

01:05:31.323 --> 01:05:32.790
over a tight beat.

01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:34.223
All: Ooh! Word up!

01:05:34.293 --> 01:05:35.726
Dre: To hip-hop.

01:05:35.794 --> 01:05:37.056
And to the new year!

01:05:37.129 --> 01:05:39.222
All: Yeah! To the new year.

01:05:39.298 --> 01:05:40.925
- Hippy-hip-hip!
- Yeah!

01:05:42.067 --> 01:05:42.999
Chris: Yeah, yeah! Ok.

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:44.365
Let's get
to the food! Yeah!

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:46.301
Excuse me. Uh, since... uh,

01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:47.770
since we're
all celebrating,

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.673
I'd like to... excuse me.
I'm sorry.

01:05:50.742 --> 01:05:53.142
I'd like to take this
to another level.

01:05:53.212 --> 01:05:54.144
Ok, bruh,
could we just stop

01:05:54.213 --> 01:05:55.145
at the food level
real quick, though?

01:05:55.214 --> 01:05:56.146
Let me just do this...

01:05:56.215 --> 01:05:57.239
Do this real quick,
and then...

01:05:57.316 --> 01:05:59.045
And then we'll eat.
Thank you.

01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:01.347
All right.
Can I have one...

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.081
One, uh...
one second, please?

01:06:04.723 --> 01:06:06.350
Let me take this.

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:07.585
Ok. Ahem.

01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:09.820
- Man: Ohh!
- Oh, my goodness!

01:06:09.895 --> 01:06:11.487
Oh, my goodness.

01:06:12.798 --> 01:06:14.288
Oh, shit, we ain't
never gonna eat now.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.658
I love you so much.

01:06:23.242 --> 01:06:24.607
Would you do me the honor

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.234
of being my wife?

01:06:30.015 --> 01:06:33.007
I don't... I don't know
what to say.

01:06:33.085 --> 01:06:35.815
Say yes.

01:06:41.994 --> 01:06:42.926
Yes.

01:06:42.995 --> 01:06:45.691
- All: All right!
- Aah! Yeah!

01:06:47.099 --> 01:06:48.361
Yes.

01:06:50.936 --> 01:06:52.528
Sidney: So,
what is the difference

01:06:52.604 --> 01:06:54.504
between rap and hip-hop?

01:06:54.573 --> 01:06:55.972
It's simple.

01:06:56.041 --> 01:06:57.099
It's like the difference

01:06:57.175 --> 01:06:59.109
between saying
you love somebody

01:06:59.177 --> 01:07:01.805
and being in love
with somebody.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.007
Rap is just a word.

01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:10.978
Um, what are you doin'?

01:07:11.056 --> 01:07:12.114
Gettin' more to drink.

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.487
You know what
I'm talkin' about.

01:07:13.559 --> 01:07:15.527
Gettin'
into this whole...

01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:16.856
marriage thing.

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:19.056
Don't you think this is
just a little too fast?

01:07:19.131 --> 01:07:20.723
You've only known the cat
for a couple months.

01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:22.232
About as long
as you knew Reese

01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:23.359
before you got married.

01:07:24.603 --> 01:07:26.161
That's why
you doing this?

01:07:26.238 --> 01:07:27.262
This whole
competition thing?

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.306
What, I marry Reese

01:07:28.373 --> 01:07:30.466
and you marry
Sasquatch?

01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:31.770
Oh, so now I'm doing
this 'cause of you?

01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:32.969
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

01:07:33.045 --> 01:07:35.513
You really on your own sack
right now. So I guess

01:07:35.581 --> 01:07:37.913
since I can't marry you,
I'm marrying Kelby.

01:07:37.983 --> 01:07:40.008
No, no, no, no! No,
that's not what I meant.

01:07:40.085 --> 01:07:42.451
No. Hey... Sid,
that's not what I meant.

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:43.613
Sid, don't...

01:07:43.689 --> 01:07:44.621
Sid!

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:45.622
Sidney!

01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:46.851
You need to talk
to your friend.

01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:48.620
[Laughs] What y'all
goin' through?

01:07:48.694 --> 01:07:50.252
You crazy.

01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:52.160
Ahh, here we go.

01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:56.229
[High Voice] Hey...

01:07:56.301 --> 01:07:57.290
Hey.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.064
Hey.

01:07:59.137 --> 01:08:00.297
What you doing?

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:01.737
Just gettin'
these champagne flutes.

01:08:01.807 --> 01:08:03.536
[Chuckles] Yeah,
that's funny.

01:08:03.609 --> 01:08:05.668
You ever wonder why they
call them champagne flutes?

01:08:05.744 --> 01:08:06.676
[Laughs]

01:08:06.745 --> 01:08:07.973
No, I never really
thought about it.

01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:09.240
Oh, shoot!

01:08:09.314 --> 01:08:10.645
Hey, don't break
the flute now.

01:08:10.716 --> 01:08:11.944
[Laughs]

01:08:12.017 --> 01:08:12.881
If you find out,

01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:14.077
get back to me
and let me know.

01:08:14.152 --> 01:08:15.517
I will. Hey, that's
a nice outfit.

01:08:15.587 --> 01:08:17.555
You look real...
real nice.

01:08:17.622 --> 01:08:19.453
And the food
was tight, too.

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:21.252
It was tasty
and nutritious.

01:08:21.326 --> 01:08:24.158
Oh, shit. Tasty
and nutritious. Oh!

01:08:25.497 --> 01:08:26.895
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:08:26.965 --> 01:08:29.229
Hey, what's goin' on?
Congratulations, man.

01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:30.734
It's a big move.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:31.734
Good luck to you, man.

01:08:31.803 --> 01:08:32.734
Look,
I've been meaning...

01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:33.736
I've been meaning
to talk to you

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:34.897
about my album, man.

01:08:34.973 --> 01:08:35.997
About my album,
you know?

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:37.301
- Your album?
- Yeah.

01:08:37.376 --> 01:08:38.308
Oh...

01:08:38.377 --> 01:08:39.935
[Drunk] It's so hard
to get respect

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.741
as an MC when
you're a ballplayer.

01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:42.745
Right, right.

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:44.782
Rappers
who play sports.

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:46.818
Yeah. Yes.
Same thing.

01:08:46.885 --> 01:08:48.785
But I was thinking,
you could be my mentor.

01:08:48.854 --> 01:08:49.843
Right.

01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:50.853
You know
what I'm sayin'?

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:52.082
- Yeah.
- Like, you could help me

01:08:52.157 --> 01:08:53.385
with my lyrics.

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:54.720
You could
work it out so my...

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.317
my... my lyrics
get tight.

01:08:56.395 --> 01:08:57.589
Tight.
Tight lyrics. Right.

01:08:57.662 --> 01:08:59.062
Like a...
like a rap coach.

01:08:59.131 --> 01:09:00.564
Like a...
like a rap coach!

01:09:00.631 --> 01:09:01.564
- Right.
- Like, exactly!

01:09:01.633 --> 01:09:02.564
# New Year's Eve #

01:09:02.634 --> 01:09:04.397
# Kelby D in the venue #

01:09:04.469 --> 01:09:05.457
# Popped the ring #

# Got marriage

01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:08.970
Marriage
on my menu, man!

01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:11.600
That's tight. It's not
just basketball with you.

01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:13.439
- Yo. Yo!
- Dre? Dre!

01:09:13.511 --> 01:09:14.911
Yo, you got
a 2-way, man?

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:16.810
Yeah. Dre?

01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:17.849
Anybody seen Dre?

01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:18.848
Kelby: Yo,
you got a number?

01:09:18.917 --> 01:09:19.849
Hey, Dre.

01:09:19.917 --> 01:09:21.112
Hey,
you all right?

01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:22.517
Yeah. Come over here
real quick.

01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:23.747
Hey, uh,

01:09:23.822 --> 01:09:26.416
what's up with, uh,
Sidney's homegirl?

01:09:26.491 --> 01:09:27.479
Sidney... oh.
Francine?

01:09:27.559 --> 01:09:29.890
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. She's cool.

01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:30.928
[Chuckles]
You feelin' her?

01:09:30.996 --> 01:09:31.928
He was all nervous,
though.

01:09:31.997 --> 01:09:32.929
It was kinda cute.

01:09:32.997 --> 01:09:33.965
[Laughs]

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:35.624
Called my food delicious
and nutritious.

01:09:35.701 --> 01:09:36.725
[Laughs] He did?

01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:37.734
We was talkin'
a little bit,

01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:38.734
you know
what I'm sayin'?

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.100
You slick dog!
You feelin' her, man!

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:41.332
So spit at her, man!
She's real cool.

01:09:41.406 --> 01:09:42.337
No, no, no, no!

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:43.339
That's what I'm
sayin', you know.

01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:44.533
I don't wanna
just, you know,

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:46.042
overwhelm her with
all my game, you know?

01:09:46.111 --> 01:09:47.372
I wanna conserve
my game.

01:09:47.446 --> 01:09:49.037
I don't wanna just blow
it all on one shot...

01:09:49.113 --> 01:09:50.479
You ever notice how
when a guy's tryin'

01:09:50.549 --> 01:09:51.481
to mack you,

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:52.812
his voice either
go real high

01:09:52.884 --> 01:09:53.975
- Or real low?
- Mm-hmm!

01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:55.246
So, I was figurin',
like, you know,

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.252
you drop a bird
to Sidney...

01:09:56.321 --> 01:09:57.948
Shh! Chris.
It's cool.

01:09:58.023 --> 01:09:58.955
If you're scared,

01:09:59.024 --> 01:09:59.956
just tell me
you scared.

01:10:00.025 --> 01:10:01.287
Just tell me.
We cool!

01:10:01.359 --> 01:10:02.826
No, I'm... I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:04.919
Listen, if you're
scared of women...

01:10:04.996 --> 01:10:06.054
Whoa, whoa!
Ooh, bro,

01:10:06.131 --> 01:10:07.063
why you talkin'
all loud, man?

01:10:07.132 --> 01:10:08.064
You don't know
with this party.

01:10:08.133 --> 01:10:09.065
This is how rumors
get started.

01:10:09.134 --> 01:10:10.567
What's wrong
with you, man?

01:10:10.635 --> 01:10:12.830
So, you gonna
give him any play?

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:14.496
I don't know.
He kind of young.

01:10:14.573 --> 01:10:15.801
First of all, I ain't
scared of women,

01:10:15.874 --> 01:10:17.171
but I ain't like you.

01:10:17.242 --> 01:10:18.641
Ok? I ain't
the black male model.

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.200
I don't be in the gym
at all times.

01:10:20.278 --> 01:10:21.438
Forget it, man. Don't
even say nothin', man.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:22.844
It's cool. I got you.
I got you. Let's go.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:23.846
You gonna
hook me up, man?

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:24.847
Don't play me, man.

01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:26.543

Kelby?

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:34.323
You know
what I think?

01:10:34.392 --> 01:10:35.324
You should hire
a lawyer

01:10:35.393 --> 01:10:36.417
to negotiate
your contract.

01:10:36.495 --> 01:10:37.621
You serious?
Yeah, I mean,

01:10:37.696 --> 01:10:39.755
why pay an agent 4%
to negotiate numbers

01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:42.026
that are already set
by a salary base cap?

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.465
Dre, don't say anything.

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:44.866
Quit while we still
have a friendship.

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:46.597
Hey, that's what I'm
tryin' to do right now.

01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:48.161
I'm trying to save
our friendship.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.172
I'm worried
about you.

01:10:49.241 --> 01:10:50.265
- Worried about me?
- Yeah!

01:10:50.342 --> 01:10:51.400
You need to stop
worrying about me

01:10:51.476 --> 01:10:52.943
and worry about
your own marriage.

01:10:53.011 --> 01:10:54.603
So you're...
excuse me.

01:10:54.679 --> 01:10:55.976
So you're
the attorney

01:10:56.047 --> 01:10:57.241
I'm supposed
to hire, right?

01:10:57.315 --> 01:11:00.079
- Yeah! Very good!

01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:01.141
Dre: My marriage?

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:02.277
What you mean?

01:11:02.354 --> 01:11:03.286
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:11:03.355 --> 01:11:04.822
Nothing. Nothing.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.255
Sidney.

01:11:06.324 --> 01:11:07.791
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:11:07.859 --> 01:11:09.328
Kelby: Maybe this
is not the best place...

01:11:09.461 --> 01:11:10.928
The best time
to talk business,

01:11:10.996 --> 01:11:13.260
but I'm sure we'll have
plenty of opportunity

01:11:13.332 --> 01:11:15.357
since our spouses
are best friends.

01:11:15.434 --> 01:11:16.992
Best... Best friends.

01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:18.161
They're so close.

01:11:18.236 --> 01:11:19.362
Yeah, well,
how... how do you feel

01:11:19.438 --> 01:11:20.496
with them being
so close?

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:21.766
Well, let's just
say it's very hard

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.807
to get used to.

01:11:22.874 --> 01:11:24.967
Sidney, what did
you mean?! Sid...

01:11:25.043 --> 01:11:27.375
Can we just
drop this already?

01:11:27.446 --> 01:11:28.378
Tell...

01:11:28.447 --> 01:11:30.244
Tell me
what you meant.

01:11:30.315 --> 01:11:31.407
Nothing.
No!

01:11:31.483 --> 01:11:33.576
You said...

01:11:33.652 --> 01:11:35.119
- Te...
- Nothing.

01:11:35.187 --> 01:11:36.711
Just...

01:11:36.788 --> 01:11:37.720
tell me.

01:11:37.789 --> 01:11:39.347
All right. Nothing.
It's nothing.

01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:40.982
It's just l... I've
been seeing her

01:11:41.059 --> 01:11:43.857
at the gym a lot
lately, and... [sighs]

01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:45.658
a lot of guys try
and run game on her,

01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:47.392
and, I don't know,
she don't seem to mind.

01:11:47.466 --> 01:11:49.696
Hmm.

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:51.030
She's a flirt.
All right?

01:11:51.103 --> 01:11:52.229
She flirts...
She flirts a lot.

01:11:52.304 --> 01:11:53.601
She's always
been a flirt.

01:11:53.672 --> 01:11:55.936
And she's flirted
with me.

01:11:56.007 --> 01:11:57.804
I'm cool with that.
She flirt.

01:11:57.876 --> 01:11:58.900
Ok.

01:11:58.977 --> 01:12:00.239
That's what I thought.

01:12:00.312 --> 01:12:01.540
You're probably right.

01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:08.883
It's when you
talk like that,

01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:09.943
that's what
makes me think

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.113
that you're jealous.

01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:12.656
- What?!
- Yes.

01:12:12.724 --> 01:12:14.316
Jealous!

01:12:14.393 --> 01:12:15.690
No wonder you two
are married.

01:12:15.761 --> 01:12:16.693
You're both crazy!

01:12:16.762 --> 01:12:17.786
Look here,

01:12:17.863 --> 01:12:19.592
contrary to what you
and your wife may think,

01:12:19.664 --> 01:12:22.030
I don't spend my nights
thinkin' about you, ok?!

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.294
I got a man who's fine,

01:12:23.368 --> 01:12:24.995
intelligent, successful,
and gives it to me

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:26.401
on a very,
very regular basis,

01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:28.234
and the shit
is the bomb!

01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:31.642
So? I don't
care what...

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:33.701
Dre, I need you
to be happy for me.

01:12:33.779 --> 01:12:35.644
I need you to be
there for me,

01:12:35.714 --> 01:12:37.238
just like
you asked of me.

01:12:37.315 --> 01:12:38.873
So... So I can have tea

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:41.942
and eat cucumber sandwiches
with the crust cut off!

happy for me.

something?

the underground review

in last month's issue?

01:14:57.689 --> 01:14:59.213
That was good.

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.223

- Yeah.

about it?

before that?

all or nothing?

01:32:13.223 --> 01:32:15.157
that you share.

01:32:15.225 --> 01:32:18.991
I also know there's a reason
you made me your wife.

01:32:19.062 --> 01:32:21.428
And I...

01:32:21.498 --> 01:32:23.329
and I'm hoping that
whatever that reason is,

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.631
it's enough to make you want
to keep me as your wife.

01:32:30.907 --> 01:32:32.397
Oh, Reesey.

01:32:37.914 --> 01:32:40.678
I do.

01:32:40.751 --> 01:32:42.275
I love you.

01:32:45.255 --> 01:32:49.919
But I think we both know
that this can't work.

01:32:49.993 --> 01:32:53.394
I don't know
if we have enough of...

01:32:53.463 --> 01:32:56.193
what it takes to...

01:32:56.266 --> 01:32:57.597
to make this last.

01:32:57.668 --> 01:33:01.536
I don't know
if we ever had enough.

01:33:07.878 --> 01:33:10.176
We can't stay married.

01:33:11.281 --> 01:33:12.680
[Footsteps]

01:33:12.749 --> 01:33:14.808
Another round?

01:33:22.392 --> 01:33:24.917
Damn. Well...

01:33:24.995 --> 01:33:27.486
at least...

01:33:27.564 --> 01:33:31.557
stay a while and have
a few drinks and...

01:33:31.635 --> 01:33:33.660
have a few laughs.

01:33:40.911 --> 01:33:42.344
I hope you realize
this means

01:33:42.412 --> 01:33:45.404
that I have to take half
of everything you have.

01:33:45.482 --> 01:33:49.248
Let me make it easy on you.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.586
Here's my little $58.25 now.

01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:15.641
Kelby...

01:34:15.712 --> 01:34:17.646
sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry.

01:34:17.714 --> 01:34:19.511
Well,
we missed the show.

01:34:21.117 --> 01:34:23.051
I'm sorry.
I just got caught

01:34:23.119 --> 01:34:25.485
in the middle
of this tug-of-war

01:34:25.555 --> 01:34:28.490
between Dre's label
and XXL and...

01:34:28.558 --> 01:34:29.820
[Sighs]

01:34:29.893 --> 01:34:31.485
I don't know what to do.

01:34:31.561 --> 01:34:32.960
I feel so helpless.

01:34:38.668 --> 01:34:41.660
Kelby, we can see the show
on Saturday.

01:34:41.738 --> 01:34:42.966
Yep.

01:34:47.143 --> 01:34:49.577
Will you wait up
a second?

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:56.249
How long are you two
gonna play this game?

01:34:56.319 --> 01:34:57.877
What are you
talking about?

01:34:57.954 --> 01:34:59.945
What am I talking about?

01:35:04.027 --> 01:35:05.551
You don't want
to get married.

01:35:13.536 --> 01:35:15.902
I love you.

01:35:19.542 --> 01:35:22.511
But not the way
you love him.

01:35:31.054 --> 01:35:32.544
I'm sorry.

01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:36.488
I don't know why
your heart doesn't do

01:35:36.559 --> 01:35:38.026
what your mind tells it.

01:35:38.094 --> 01:35:40.119
You don't know.

01:35:49.572 --> 01:35:51.597
I'm sorry.

01:36:04.087 --> 01:36:06.351
# Lying here #

01:36:06.422 --> 01:36:09.118
# How bad I feel #

01:36:09.192 --> 01:36:12.593
#The clock tick #

01:36:12.662 --> 01:36:14.960
#And I think of you... #

01:36:15.031 --> 01:36:17.465
Sidney: I always thought,

01:36:17.534 --> 01:36:20.298
one day I would outgrow

01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:22.304
my relationship with hip-hop.

01:36:22.372 --> 01:36:25.466
# Confusion #

01:36:25.542 --> 01:36:27.066
# Is nothing new #

01:36:27.143 --> 01:36:29.304
Sidney: I never thought
it was a fad, like many.

01:36:29.379 --> 01:36:32.007
# Flash back #

01:36:32.081 --> 01:36:34.174
#All night #

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.775
But I never thought
it could grow and mature.

01:36:36.853 --> 01:36:39.754
#Almost left behind #

01:36:40.824 --> 01:36:44.316
# Suitcase #

01:36:44.394 --> 01:36:47.989
# Of memories #

01:36:48.064 --> 01:36:53.400
#Time after sometimes #

01:36:53.469 --> 01:36:56.370
#You picture me #

01:36:56.439 --> 01:36:58.839
# I'm walking #

01:36:58.908 --> 01:37:02.674
#Too far ahead #

01:37:02.745 --> 01:37:07.273
#You're calling to me... #

01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:10.285
Sidney: I thought it would be
an adolescent memory

01:37:10.353 --> 01:37:11.615
I'd look back on,

01:37:11.688 --> 01:37:15.021
like a crush on the captain
of the football team.

01:37:15.091 --> 01:37:17.685
But I realize
we have more than that.

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.694
Much more.

01:37:19.762 --> 01:37:22.060
We have a history...

01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:24.031
a friendship.

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.330
We listen to each other.

01:37:26.402 --> 01:37:28.427
We laugh together.

01:37:28.504 --> 01:37:31.530
We finish
each other's lyrics.

01:37:31.608 --> 01:37:34.702
I don't have to pretend
with hip-hop,

01:37:34.777 --> 01:37:37.211
and hip-hop doesn't
have to pretend with me.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:40.875
#You will find me #

01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:45.046
#Time after time #

01:37:45.121 --> 01:37:48.648
Sidney: My feelings
have never been more clear,

01:37:48.725 --> 01:37:50.215
and I know
they will never go away.

01:37:50.293 --> 01:37:52.523
# I'll be waiting #

01:37:52.595 --> 01:37:53.721
To hip-hop.

01:37:53.796 --> 01:37:57.732
#Time after time #

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.735
# Mmm mmm... #

01:37:58.735 --> 01:38:01.465
# Mmm mmm... #

01:38:08.811 --> 01:38:10.108
Wait. Didn't I
already see you?

01:38:10.179 --> 01:38:11.476
Mm, yeah.

01:38:11.547 --> 01:38:13.242
So what are you doing
back here?

01:38:13.316 --> 01:38:15.944
I know that y'all
put a new song in rotation

01:38:16.019 --> 01:38:17.247
every week.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.413
So I figure

01:38:19.489 --> 01:38:22.356
I'm gonna show up
every week

01:38:22.425 --> 01:38:25.258
till you take
a serious listen to this CD.

01:38:25.328 --> 01:38:27.421
Then I'm gonna come back

01:38:27.497 --> 01:38:28.862
every week

01:38:28.932 --> 01:38:32.129
until you put
this here CD into rotation.

01:38:36.039 --> 01:38:38.633
Every week.

01:38:52.121 --> 01:38:54.351
She say no.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.227
You playin'.

01:38:59.295 --> 01:39:00.728
Uh-uh. No, man.

01:39:00.797 --> 01:39:01.729
You're not playin'?

01:39:01.798 --> 01:39:03.060
I'm not playin', man.

01:39:03.132 --> 01:39:04.394
You for real?

01:39:04.467 --> 01:39:05.798
For real, man.

01:39:05.868 --> 01:39:06.892
Come here, boy!

01:39:06.970 --> 01:39:07.902
Yeah!

01:39:07.971 --> 01:39:08.960
Yeah, man.

01:39:09.038 --> 01:39:10.801
- It's you, man.
- Whoo!

01:39:10.873 --> 01:39:12.067
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:39:12.141 --> 01:39:13.665
We did it, man.

01:39:13.743 --> 01:39:15.711
You are the man!

01:39:15.778 --> 01:39:17.712
# I worship at the temple
of hip-hop #

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.543
#Attended service,
Eric gave a sermon #

01:39:19.615 --> 01:39:20.946
# But the minister
became intensely nervous #

01:39:21.017 --> 01:39:22.177
#When the killa priest
went buck wild #

01:39:22.251 --> 01:39:23.343
#And made the reverend run #

01:39:23.419 --> 01:39:24.351
# I reached in... #

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:25.717
She said the Angie
show, right?

01:39:32.261 --> 01:39:34.559
They still come on
at the same time, right?

01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:36.461
Yes, man.

01:39:40.570 --> 01:39:43.266
Still thinking about
Sidney, huh?

01:39:46.209 --> 01:39:47.574
Yeah, man.

01:39:47.643 --> 01:39:49.770
I told you
you was a punk.

01:39:50.947 --> 01:39:53.973
Who you callin' punk?

01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:55.074
I know
you be trippin'.

01:39:55.151 --> 01:39:56.413
Get your black ass...

01:39:56.486 --> 01:39:57.578
Now, let me tell you...

01:39:57.653 --> 01:39:58.881
You better switch
to that old crack,

01:39:58.955 --> 01:40:00.547
'cause the new crack
is killing you.

01:40:00.623 --> 01:40:01.555
Don't...

01:40:01.624 --> 01:40:02.556
Yeah.

01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:03.557
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:03.626 --> 01:40:04.558
Yeah, what?

01:40:04.627 --> 01:40:06.060
They call me "Night Train"

01:40:06.129 --> 01:40:06.959

a nigga to sleep.

Sid Shaw, editor of
XXL magazine.

01:40:12.702 --> 01:40:14.431
What's been going on?

01:40:14.504 --> 01:40:16.438
Oh, it's been mad crazy,
working on the magazine,

01:40:16.506 --> 01:40:17.939
and, uh...

01:40:18.007 --> 01:40:20.066
I just finished my book.

01:40:20.143 --> 01:40:21.167
Yay. Good.

01:40:21.244 --> 01:40:22.472
It's about hip-hop?

01:40:22.545 --> 01:40:24.911
It's my love letter
to hip-hop.

01:40:24.981 --> 01:40:27.472
Sweet. What, uh,
what's the name of it?

01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:29.643
It's called
I Used To Love Him.

01:40:29.719 --> 01:40:31.152
All right.
Like the Common joint?

01:40:31.221 --> 01:40:32.882
Mm-hmm. That's it.

01:40:32.956 --> 01:40:34.218
The classic Common joint,

01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:35.484
which, actually,
we should play right now,

01:40:35.558 --> 01:40:36.650
since we're talkin'
about that.

01:40:36.726 --> 01:40:37.818
It's a perfect
opportunity to do that.

01:40:37.894 --> 01:40:39.191
Let's do this. It's my
joint right here, too.

01:40:39.262 --> 01:40:40.251
I love it.

01:40:40.330 --> 01:40:41.991
Um, you want to
dedicate it to anybody?

01:40:42.065 --> 01:40:44.431
Yeah. Um...

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.094
I would, uh,
like to dedicate this song,

01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:48.797
like I dedicated my book,

01:40:48.871 --> 01:40:50.702
to hip-hop.

01:40:50.773 --> 01:40:52.263
I used to love you.

01:40:52.342 --> 01:40:54.606
I still do.

01:40:54.677 --> 01:40:57.168
And always will.

01:40:57.247 --> 01:40:59.272
You better go get her,
Humphrey.

01:40:59.349 --> 01:41:01.442
Common: #What I love most,
she has so much soul #

01:41:01.517 --> 01:41:03.917
# She was old school
when I was just a shorty #

01:41:03.987 --> 01:41:06.547
# Never knew throughout my life
she would be there for me #

01:41:06.623 --> 01:41:09.183
It's Hot 97,
blazin' hip-hop and R&B.

01:41:09.259 --> 01:41:11.955
Angie Mart, Sid Shaw
in the place, XXL.

01:41:12.028 --> 01:41:13.825
And, uh, we should
get back to the phones.

01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:14.828
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:41:14.897 --> 01:41:16.330
Let some people
holler at you.

01:41:16.399 --> 01:41:18.833
Let's go to 5.
Where you from?

01:41:18.901 --> 01:41:20.596
Dre: Uh, the Boogie Down...
South Bronx...

01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:22.331
And I'm here to set
the record straight.

01:41:22.405 --> 01:41:25.966
So, um, I got a question
for... for Sidney Shaw.

01:41:26.042 --> 01:41:26.974
Ok.

01:41:27.043 --> 01:41:28.271
Uh, Sidney Shaw,

01:41:28.344 --> 01:41:30.437
when did you fall in love
with hip-hop?

01:41:32.615 --> 01:41:36.346
When I heard Kangol Crew
and Get Fresh Crew.

01:41:36.419 --> 01:41:37.943
Well, I don't think you
understood the question,

01:41:38.021 --> 01:41:39.420
so I'm gonna ask you again.

01:41:39.489 --> 01:41:40.786
Sid...

01:41:40.857 --> 01:41:44.190
when did you fall in love...

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.818
with hip-hop?

01:41:47.363 --> 01:41:48.557
[Knock On Glass]

01:41:48.631 --> 01:41:49.620
[Mouthing]
Talk to him.

01:41:58.441 --> 01:42:00.568
Dre...

01:42:00.643 --> 01:42:01.769
I've been in love
with you

01:42:01.844 --> 01:42:04.677
from the first day
I saw you.

01:42:04.747 --> 01:42:06.476
[Sighs, Whispers]
Thank you.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.718
All right, I got a...
I got a follow-up question.

01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:17.248
Uh, why'd it take you
so long to say that?

01:42:17.327 --> 01:42:18.726
'Cause I was scared.

01:42:20.096 --> 01:42:21.028
And hardheaded.

01:42:21.097 --> 01:42:22.894
[Whispers]
And stupid.

01:42:22.965 --> 01:42:24.330
[Chuckles]

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.425
Real hardheaded.

01:42:26.502 --> 01:42:30.563
So, I'm listening
to Hot 97

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.972
'cause I hear... hey...

01:42:33.042 --> 01:42:33.974
- No.
- Shh!

01:42:34.043 --> 01:42:35.874
I hear that they
about to play

01:42:35.945 --> 01:42:38.880
Cavi's first single.
So I'm like "yo."

01:42:38.948 --> 01:42:41.883
This is a big...
Down here?

01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:44.078

Big things is
going down, Sid.

01:42:47.023 --> 01:42:48.854
Just like you said

01:42:48.925 --> 01:42:51.894
And I couldn't be
more unhappy

01:42:51.961 --> 01:42:54.452
because for the first time

01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:58.899
since...
I can remember...

01:42:58.968 --> 01:43:03.371
I didn't have you
to share my life with.

01:43:03.439 --> 01:43:05.430
Sidney...

01:43:05.508 --> 01:43:07.408
I have loved you

01:43:07.477 --> 01:43:11.038
from the first time
I laid eyes on you.

01:43:11.114 --> 01:43:13.605

still.

01:43:17.887 --> 01:43:19.445
You're my air.

01:43:21.224 --> 01:43:24.159
So, I don't want to be
your friend no more.

01:43:40.476 --> 01:43:42.137
There we go.

01:43:42.211 --> 01:43:43.473

to get a room.

01:43:43.546 --> 01:43:45.343

01:43:55.158 --> 01:43:57.092
I found out
some more stuff

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.594
about those, uh,
those champagne flutes.

01:43:59.662 --> 01:44:01.687
They call 'em
champagne flutes

01:44:01.764 --> 01:44:02.696
because, you know,

01:44:02.765 --> 01:44:03.959
they're all long
and narrow

01:44:04.033 --> 01:44:05.227
like, you know, like
woodwind instruments,

01:44:05.301 --> 01:44:06.359
like, uh, you know,
like a...

01:44:06.436 --> 01:44:07.368
- Flute.
- Right.

01:44:07.437 --> 01:44:08.529
That's right...

01:44:08.604 --> 01:44:09.935
is in there,
and, uh...

01:44:10.006 --> 01:44:11.871

Marie Antoinette...

01:44:11.941 --> 01:44:13.101
I don't know
if you know her...

01:44:13.176 --> 01:44:14.768
But, um, you know,
she didn't like

01:44:14.844 --> 01:44:16.106
the regular common
glasses,

01:44:16.179 --> 01:44:17.305
so she had them
make, uh, glasses

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:19.644
that looked like
her, uh... uh... eh,

01:44:19.715 --> 01:44:22.513

upper body. Right.
