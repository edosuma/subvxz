Don't be shy, guys. Fire away.

00:47.888 --> 00:50.137
Why you talk like a white girl?

00:50.138 --> 00:52.470
Ha.

00:52.471 --> 00:54.762
You caught me. I'm rocking blackface.

00:56.888 --> 00:58.512
That's racist.

00:58.513 --> 01:00.012
Any other questions?

01:00.013 --> 01:01.637
What's up with your hair?

01:01.638 --> 01:03.512
I don't know what you mean.

01:03.513 --> 01:05.220
My cousin can put some tracks in it,

01:05.221 --> 01:06.887
unless you like it like that.

01:06.888 --> 01:08.762
You rude. She African.

01:09.971 --> 01:11.637
We're all from Africa, guys.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.512
Absolutely. Let's stick to
questions about the program.

01:14.513 --> 01:15.721
Sorry.

01:16.971 --> 01:19.220
Is this what you always wanted to do?

01:19.221 --> 01:22.095
Uh, no, but I got this job after college

01:22.096 --> 01:24.012
and it fit my interest at the time.

01:24.013 --> 01:26.387
- Are you single?
- Uh, I don't think that's appropriate.

01:26.388 --> 01:28.637
Yeah, she's single.

01:31.846 --> 01:34.762
Okay, since you guys are so
interested in my personal life,

01:34.763 --> 01:37.637
here it is... I'm 28, actually 29,

01:37.638 --> 01:39.137
'cause today's my birthday.

01:39.138 --> 01:41.762
I came from a great family,
I have a college degree.

01:41.763 --> 01:44.887
I work in the nonprofit world
because I like to give back.

01:44.888 --> 01:46.637
I've been with my boyfriend
for five years,

01:46.638 --> 01:48.595
and I did this to my hair on purpose.

01:48.596 --> 01:50.387
So, I hope that covers everything.

01:50.388 --> 01:53.095
Does anybody actually have any
questions about We Got Y'all?

01:53.096 --> 01:55.470
- Why ain't you married?
- I'm just not right now.

01:55.471 --> 01:57.220
My dad said ain't nobody checkin'

01:57.221 --> 01:59.220
for bitter-ass black women anymore.

02:01.346 --> 02:03.845
Dayniece, that's detention.
Apologize now.

02:03.846 --> 02:05.928
Sorry.

02:05.929 --> 02:07.678
That... that's okay. And tell your dad

02:07.679 --> 02:09.220
that black women aren't bitter.

02:09.221 --> 02:11.679
They're just tired of being
expected to settle for less.

02:13.846 --> 02:16.303
Her outfit settled for less.

02:29.554 --> 02:31.470
My boss founded a nonprofit

02:31.471 --> 02:33.095
to help kids from the hood,

02:33.096 --> 02:35.970
but she didn't hire
anybody from the hood.

02:35.971 --> 02:38.678
I'm torn between the Booker T. method

02:38.679 --> 02:40.178
and the DuBois method.

02:40.179 --> 02:43.220
What would James Baldwin
say is most beneficial

02:43.221 --> 02:44.845
for people of color?

02:44.846 --> 02:46.845
In 2016? That's what
you're talking about?

02:46.846 --> 02:48.845
I've been here five years and they think

02:48.846 --> 02:51.220
I'm the token with all the answers.

02:51.221 --> 02:53.095
Let's just ask Issa.

02:53.096 --> 02:56.221
Issa, what's "on fleek"?

02:59.221 --> 03:01.220
I don't know what that means.

03:01.221 --> 03:03.428
I know what that shit means.

03:03.429 --> 03:05.845
But being aggressively passive
is what I do best.

03:05.846 --> 03:07.345
I used to keep a journal to vent.

03:07.346 --> 03:08.845
Now I just write raps.

03:08.846 --> 03:11.428
? Go, shawty, it's my birthday ?

03:11.429 --> 03:13.970
? But no one cares because
I'm not having a party ?

03:13.971 --> 03:18.057
? 'Cause I'm feeling sorry
for my... self. ?

03:21.714 --> 03:23.114
_

03:34.849 --> 03:36.967
_

03:38.346 --> 03:41.053
? Oh, look, nigga,
guess you're still single ?

03:41.054 --> 03:44.678
? Couldn't find another bitch
to make your toes tingle ?

03:44.679 --> 03:46.345
? Hot shit. ?

03:46.346 --> 03:48.470
How different would my life be

03:48.471 --> 03:50.625
if I actually went after what I wanted?

03:55.371 --> 03:58.120
Maybe I'd be more like
my best friend, Molly.

03:58.121 --> 04:00.287
She's like the Will Smith of corporate.

04:00.288 --> 04:03.662
So, they want us to be more
environmentally responsible.

04:03.663 --> 04:06.037
But it's like, seriously,
why do we need trees?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.245
White people looove Molly.

04:10.246 --> 04:14.412
Black people also looove Molly.

04:14.413 --> 04:16.088
Domino, bitch!

04:18.413 --> 04:19.963
What am I doing wrong?

04:23.163 --> 04:25.787
Wait. You got the LaVinci
family to settle?

04:25.788 --> 04:29.037
- Yep.
- No frickin' way. How?

04:29.038 --> 04:31.037
I convinced their
youngest son to testify.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.287
His inheritance was already guaranteed.

04:33.288 --> 04:36.662
God, that's unbelievable. Please,
please teach me your ways.

04:36.663 --> 04:38.787
One day.

04:38.788 --> 04:42.662
- Oh, is that that Arab guy?
- Yes. He says, "Hey."

04:42.663 --> 04:43.870
I love it.

04:43.871 --> 04:46.495
So sweet. What are you gonna write back?

04:46.496 --> 04:47.912
I think I'm just gonna call him

04:47.913 --> 04:50.912
'cause, I mean, "hey"
means "I wanna talk," right?

04:50.913 --> 04:53.162
Yeah, sure, I think it could.

04:53.699 --> 04:55.495
_

04:55.496 --> 04:56.845
What'd he say?

04:56.869 --> 04:59.211
He... he must be
texting me from a meeting.

04:59.236 --> 05:00.745
You know, he's a product engineer,

05:00.746 --> 05:03.412
so he's probably engineering
shit as we speak.

05:03.413 --> 05:06.495
- Seems like you really like him.
- _

05:06.496 --> 05:08.412
You know, I do.

05:08.413 --> 05:11.912
We've only been on three dates,
but he's so different.

05:11.913 --> 05:14.162
I never thought I'd end up
with someone who wasn't black.

05:14.163 --> 05:15.412
- You know?
- Totally.

05:15.413 --> 05:16.912
Me and Jamal are always talking

05:16.913 --> 05:18.662
about how we're not each other's types,

05:18.663 --> 05:21.037
but, I don't know, it works.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.495
Girl, Jamal is frontin'.

05:23.496 --> 05:26.037
Niggas love Asians and Latinas

05:26.038 --> 05:29.120
and Indians and white
chicks and mixed chicks.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.120
But you know what, if they
are not checkin' for me,

05:31.121 --> 05:33.025
I ain't checkin' for them.

05:34.252 --> 05:38.111
_

05:39.121 --> 05:41.538
Jamal said I was his first.

05:51.371 --> 05:53.412
We were just going with the flow.

05:53.413 --> 05:55.287
It came out of nowhere,
'cause, personally,

05:55.288 --> 05:56.662
I thought we were having a good time.

05:56.663 --> 05:59.162
Wait? Whose idea was it
to go with the flow?

05:59.163 --> 06:00.537
Oh, it was mutual.

06:00.538 --> 06:01.745
Mm.

06:01.746 --> 06:04.537
Okay, bitch, it was his,
but I was cool with it.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.412
- Was he hairy?
- He was Arab.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.037
- So, yeah.
- Absolutely.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.412
And then he was also,
like, calling me every day

06:10.413 --> 06:12.120
and sending me text messages.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.412
- Oh, damn.
- Right?

06:13.413 --> 06:16.162
And then this motherfucker
got the audacity

06:16.163 --> 06:18.037
to hit me with this bullshit.

06:18.038 --> 06:22.037
"Sorry. I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

06:22.038 --> 06:23.370
Sad face."

06:23.371 --> 06:26.662
He did not sad face you.
I will slap you right...

06:26.663 --> 06:29.412
bish... whaat?

06:29.413 --> 06:30.629
That's my life.

06:32.413 --> 06:35.037
Can we eat? I'm hungry as fuck, okay?

06:35.038 --> 06:37.287
Have you ever tried, like, the raw meat?

06:37.288 --> 06:39.745
Not that raw meat,
but you know what I'm sayin'.

06:39.746 --> 06:41.996
But, like, the food.

06:44.163 --> 06:45.288
You okay?

06:47.288 --> 06:50.287
Yeah, girl. You know what,
this is your birthday.

06:50.288 --> 06:51.995
I don't wanna make this about me. No.

06:51.996 --> 06:54.912
Girl, stop. What's going on?

06:56.371 --> 06:59.412
It's, like, it doesn't
matter what I do, Issa.

06:59.413 --> 07:01.537
If I'm into them,
then I'm too smothering.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.412
If I take my time
or try to give them space,

07:03.413 --> 07:04.870
"Oh, I didn't think you were into me."

07:04.871 --> 07:06.912
Fine. Sex right away. Lose interest.

07:06.913 --> 07:08.537
Wait to have sex. Lose interest.

07:08.538 --> 07:12.120
If I don't have sex at all...
motherfucker, no!

07:12.121 --> 07:14.441
I'm a grown-ass woman. I did
not sign up for that bullshit.

07:19.996 --> 07:21.662
I think your pussy's broken.

07:21.663 --> 07:23.870
- What?
- No, I read about it.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.662
It's, like, pussies breaking everywhere.

07:25.663 --> 07:28.537
I think your pussy's sad.
It's had enough.

07:28.538 --> 07:31.871
And if it could talk, it would
make that sad Marge Simpson groan.

07:35.746 --> 07:39.037
Yes, that's it! That's your pussy!

07:39.038 --> 07:41.120
You're an asshole. Fuck you, Issa.

07:41.121 --> 07:42.662
They're gonna kick us
out this restaurant.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.620
- Are you ladies ready?
- Uh, no.

07:44.621 --> 07:46.287
Can you give us, like, two minutes?

07:46.288 --> 07:48.037
- We're just, you know.
- All right.

07:48.038 --> 07:50.370
- She not gonna come back for hours.
- Her broke pussy talking.

07:50.371 --> 07:52.787
Where's the broken pussy?
Choose number four.

07:52.788 --> 07:56.912
- Thanks for treating me, girl.
- You know I got you.

07:56.913 --> 08:00.787
Now, why don't you go home and get
you some of that good birthday ass?

08:00.788 --> 08:02.912
"Yes, Lawrence. How you doin' there?"

08:02.913 --> 08:05.870
Actually, I'm thinking about
ending things with Lawrence.

08:05.871 --> 08:08.245
I'm sorry, what was that?
Did you not just see me

08:08.246 --> 08:10.037
crying tears of singleness in there?

08:10.038 --> 08:12.162
No, no, no. One of us
is having sex tonight.

08:12.163 --> 08:14.870
We don't do anything.
Like, there's no excitement.

08:14.871 --> 08:16.859
It's just too comfortable.

08:16.884 --> 08:18.587
Okay, wait.
Are you guys fighting or what?

08:18.611 --> 08:19.671
No, I wish.

08:19.696 --> 08:23.120
Sometimes I wish he'd just slap the
shit out of me out of angry passion.

08:23.121 --> 08:24.370
Not really, but kinda.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.870
So, you're an idiot. That's cool.

08:25.871 --> 08:28.620
No, seriously. I'm
starting to resent him.

08:28.621 --> 08:30.245
Like, I spent my entire 20s

08:30.246 --> 08:32.120
with a dude that I'm not
even gonna end up with.

08:32.121 --> 08:35.328
Well, I mean, you're still 29.

08:35.328 --> 08:37.203
You got one more year.

08:37.203 --> 08:39.370
- Bitch, you're right.
- I know.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.370
I don't have time
for the bullshit anymore.

08:41.371 --> 08:44.328
- Wait, what are you saying?
- I'm breaking up with him tonight.

08:44.329 --> 08:46.995
- Bitch, no you're not.
- Yeah, you're right I'm not.

08:46.996 --> 08:48.681
- 'Course I'm not.
- I know you.

09:01.746 --> 09:04.995
- Hey. Happy birthday, babe.
- Thank you.

09:04.996 --> 09:07.993
Why aren't you dressed?
The show starts at 10:00, right?

09:09.954 --> 09:12.620
- I bombed the interview.
- Jeez, Lawrence.

09:12.621 --> 09:14.370
I... I just got nervous,

09:14.371 --> 09:17.870
and I started saying stuff
that didn't make any sense.

09:17.871 --> 09:19.870
I didn't talk about anything
I could bring to the table.

09:19.871 --> 09:22.579
I just spit words out.

09:23.746 --> 09:25.370
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

09:25.371 --> 09:27.745
No, I literally spit on him, all right?

09:27.746 --> 09:30.245
Then I spilled hot coffee
all over his desk.

09:30.246 --> 09:32.121
Never mind, then.

09:34.954 --> 09:37.121
Hey, I'm sorry for
ruining your birthday.

09:38.871 --> 09:42.078
All right? But can we, you
know, do a Redbox movie

09:42.079 --> 09:43.745
and just stay in?

09:43.746 --> 09:45.621
I promise I'll make it up to you.

09:46.996 --> 09:48.328
Come on, hmm?

09:48.329 --> 09:50.245
Hmm? Mm-wah! All right, thanks.

09:50.246 --> 09:52.453
Let me finish watching this video
and then we can go to 7-Eleven.

09:52.454 --> 09:54.870
You want pecs? You want abs?

09:54.871 --> 09:56.245
It takes fucking discipline.

09:56.246 --> 09:58.203
So stop making excuses and do it.

09:58.204 --> 10:00.995
- Make it happen.
- It's not gonna happen...

10:00.996 --> 10:02.870
by sittin' on your ass!

10:02.871 --> 10:04.071
What did you want to rent?

10:04.095 --> 10:06.971
- You know what, you pick.
- _

10:06.996 --> 10:08.870
I wish I could come
through that screening

10:08.871 --> 10:11.550
- pump the fuck out of your lazy ass.
- _

10:13.079 --> 10:15.870
And these poor, poor children

10:15.871 --> 10:17.828
need our guidance more than anything.

10:17.829 --> 10:19.995
They were so intent on not acknowledging

10:19.996 --> 10:22.328
the burdens that face them every day.

10:22.329 --> 10:24.495
They focused mostly on Issa's love life,

10:24.496 --> 10:27.078
which I have to say served
as a great icebreaker.

10:30.454 --> 10:32.620
Ahem, Thomas Jefferson
Middle School statistics

10:32.621 --> 10:36.328
state that 40% will not
graduate high school

10:36.329 --> 10:38.870
and 20% will become teen parents.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.620
We absolutely have to intervene.

10:40.621 --> 10:43.828
Educated black women
are highly unlikely to get married

10:43.829 --> 10:45.620
the more education they have.

10:45.621 --> 10:48.620
On the bright side, many
black women are work-focused

10:48.621 --> 10:50.745
and find happiness in their careers.

10:50.746 --> 10:54.703
But, then, there is a small percentage

10:54.704 --> 10:57.453
of pathetic women who have neither.

10:57.454 --> 10:58.745
They are purposeless.

10:58.746 --> 11:00.204
You're wrong!

11:04.121 --> 11:06.453
What is she wrong about, Issa?

11:06.454 --> 11:08.453
What do you think we need to do

11:08.454 --> 11:11.495
to help these kids?

11:11.496 --> 11:15.120
Well, stop treating them like
they're all the same, for one.

11:15.121 --> 11:16.870
They already get enough of that.

11:16.871 --> 11:20.453
I think these kids need permission
to explore on their own.

11:20.454 --> 11:23.120
Okay, well, where does
We Got Y'all fit in?

11:23.121 --> 11:24.995
Right, uh...

11:24.996 --> 11:27.245
nothing's gonna change for these kids

11:27.246 --> 11:29.745
if they're stuck
in the same shitty place.

11:29.746 --> 11:32.245
They need to know that there's
more out there for them.

11:32.246 --> 11:34.870
So, as youth liaison,
I want to take the lead

11:34.871 --> 11:37.946
on building a program for the
kids outside of the school.

11:39.871 --> 11:41.453
Great. Work with Frieda.

11:41.454 --> 11:43.620
Have a proposal to me by Monday.

11:43.621 --> 11:45.828
- All right, Ken and Patricia...
- Love it.

11:45.829 --> 11:48.245
...tell me about
San Pedro Middle School.

11:48.246 --> 11:50.495
Last year, we had black and white.

11:50.496 --> 11:53.829
We didn't want to spend
a lot on the brochures, but...

11:53.853 --> 11:55.745
_

11:55.746 --> 11:57.870
- Good job.
- Thanks.

11:57.871 --> 12:00.495
I just was not expecting it!

12:00.496 --> 12:03.370
I walk in, and, first of
all, he was being shady.

12:03.371 --> 12:05.995
All night I had
no idea what was going on.

12:05.996 --> 12:08.828
- And I go into the house...
- Hey, guys.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.578
What'd I miss?

12:13.121 --> 12:16.621
Molly, I got engaged.
He proposed last night!

12:17.829 --> 12:19.620
Wow. Oh, my God.

12:19.621 --> 12:21.370
I'm so happy for you.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.203
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:23.204 --> 12:25.620
- Finish the story. Finish the story.
- Okay, okay.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.703
So, um, okay. So, where was I?

12:27.704 --> 12:31.745
I walked in and my favorite
flowers are, like, everywhere.

12:31.746 --> 12:32.995
And he had these little notes

12:32.996 --> 12:34.870
that were, like, tied to balloons.

12:34.871 --> 12:36.953
Balloons. Wow, for real?

12:36.954 --> 12:39.120
Girl, that... that is crazy. Balloons.

12:39.121 --> 12:43.203
Yeah, they were, like, tied to
my friends and family... sorry.

12:43.204 --> 12:45.959
- Wow, balloons.
- That's insane. You deserve it.

12:50.496 --> 12:51.496
Hi, girl.

12:51.497 --> 12:53.370
It is never happening for me.

12:53.371 --> 12:55.870
You sound like you're exercising.
You don't exercise.

12:55.871 --> 12:57.495
Diane got engaged.

12:57.496 --> 13:00.203
- To her black boyfriend?
- Yes!

13:00.204 --> 13:01.495
Damn!

13:01.496 --> 13:03.370
That wife "others" up with a quickness.

13:03.371 --> 13:05.495
Right? And they don't
even have to be that cute.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.703
You know, I'm not trying to be
shady, but why does she deserve

13:07.704 --> 13:09.370
to get married, and I don't?

13:09.371 --> 13:12.078
Girl, stop. Who says you
don't deserve to be married?

13:12.079 --> 13:13.370
Jesus, apparently!

13:13.371 --> 13:15.370
He the nigga that gave me
this broken-ass pussy!

13:15.371 --> 13:18.203
Okay, listen, I promise
Jesus isn't conspiring

13:18.204 --> 13:20.204
against you and your pussy.

13:21.746 --> 13:23.619
- You need to go out tonight.
- No.

13:23.620 --> 13:24.876
I'm taking you out.
Be ready by 8:00. Bye.

13:24.901 --> 13:25.945
Wait...

13:25.970 --> 13:27.871
Issa? Issa?

13:39.746 --> 13:40.995
Hi, I'm sexy.

13:40.996 --> 13:43.620
Let's get outta here. You're super!

13:43.621 --> 13:46.578
Oh, my God, you're a music producer.
Do you know Beck?

13:46.579 --> 13:48.120
I don't make love, I fuck.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.995
You want some of this pussy pot pie?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.578
Pop, pop, pop! Prrrrr pop, pop!

13:52.579 --> 13:54.203
Pot pie!

13:54.204 --> 13:56.078
Well, hello, Daniel.

13:56.079 --> 13:59.328
No, you drive on the wrong
side of the street.

13:59.329 --> 14:02.120
Let me sprinkle
some pussy Parmesan on you.

14:02.121 --> 14:03.620
Awesome.

14:03.621 --> 14:05.495
You hungry?

14:05.496 --> 14:07.495
Hey, tiger. Mm-hmm.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.203
No, that's so stupid.

14:09.204 --> 14:11.870
Take a drink. Whoo! Shots, shots!

14:13.079 --> 14:14.370
You gonna take this nonny or not?

14:14.371 --> 14:16.370
Take this nonny! Take it!

14:18.746 --> 14:20.495
It's too aggressive.

14:32.603 --> 14:34.603
Wow. What are you all dressed up for?

14:34.621 --> 14:36.578
I'm taking Molly out tonight.

14:36.579 --> 14:39.245
On a date? Should I be jealous?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.870
Uh, no, she's just really upset

14:40.871 --> 14:42.578
and I want to make her feel better.

14:42.579 --> 14:44.120
What's wrong with her now?

14:44.121 --> 14:45.995
She doesn't think
she'll ever get married.

14:45.996 --> 14:49.953
Ha! She might be onto something.

14:49.954 --> 14:52.495
Don't be a dick. Dating is hard.

14:52.496 --> 14:55.120
Not if she didn't take it so seriously.

14:55.121 --> 14:57.056
Plus her standards are way too high.

15:00.621 --> 15:02.828
Yeah, maybe she should
lower them like I did.

15:02.829 --> 15:04.620
Wait, what the fuck?

15:04.621 --> 15:06.495
Never mind. Just forget it. I'm sorry.

15:06.496 --> 15:07.953
No. What's that supposed to mean?

15:07.954 --> 15:09.703
It means sometimes

15:09.704 --> 15:11.120
I don't know what the fuck we're doing.

15:11.121 --> 15:12.995
Uh, we're together?

15:12.996 --> 15:14.495
Yeah, but where are we going?

15:14.496 --> 15:16.620
- Are we here? Is this it?
- Babe.

15:16.621 --> 15:18.495
Because maybe I didn't know
it before, but I know it now,

15:18.496 --> 15:20.620
and I don't wanna just
sit on the couch with you

15:20.621 --> 15:23.370
for the rest of my life and
wait for something to happen.

15:23.371 --> 15:24.745
What are you talking about?

15:24.746 --> 15:26.578
Nobody's just sitting on the couch.

15:26.579 --> 15:28.328
I'm almost done with my business plan.

15:28.329 --> 15:30.245
You know, I'm just
getting my shit together.

15:30.246 --> 15:32.995
You've been getting your shit
together for four years, Lawrence.

15:34.246 --> 15:35.953
I just feel like we're wasting our time.

15:35.954 --> 15:37.871
I don't have time to waste.

15:40.579 --> 15:41.995
So what are you saying?

15:41.996 --> 15:44.120
I'm saying maybe we should

15:44.121 --> 15:47.329
get our shit together separately
and see what happens.

15:48.746 --> 15:50.995
You wanna break up with me?

15:50.996 --> 15:52.712
- Molly's waiting on me. I'm...
- _

15:52.736 --> 15:53.929
- gonna spend the night at her house.
- _

15:53.954 --> 15:56.370
- We can talk about this tomorrow.
- Hey. Issa!

15:56.371 --> 15:59.454
- See you later.
- Hey! Iss!

16:07.871 --> 16:10.620
Issa, why are we in 1997 Inglewood?

16:10.621 --> 16:13.620
Bitch, I don't know.
I've never been here before.

16:13.621 --> 16:15.328
But I've heard really good things.

16:15.329 --> 16:17.453
Nigga, from who,
your middle-school Crips?

16:17.454 --> 16:19.703
Will you stop being
all judgmental, okay?

16:19.704 --> 16:22.328
I could've taken you to some
stuck-up Hollywood spot

16:22.329 --> 16:25.328
with a bunch of assholes,
but we're here, okay?

16:25.329 --> 16:27.496
Let's have fun tonight.

16:30.246 --> 16:32.620
Yes.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.370
Fine, but you are buying me a drink.

16:34.371 --> 16:36.495
Okay. You're gonna have
some drinks tonight.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.120
You're gonna get so fucked up.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

16:39.121 --> 16:41.745
Oh. It's gonna be a strong drink.

16:49.371 --> 16:52.287
- So, are y'all broken up or not?
- I think so.

16:52.288 --> 16:54.037
You know, I told him how I felt,

16:54.038 --> 16:56.662
and his last words were, "You
wanna break up with me?"

16:56.663 --> 16:58.395
And you said?

16:58.419 --> 17:00.120
That I was spending
the night at your house

17:00.121 --> 17:01.537
and that we'd talk about it later.

17:01.538 --> 17:03.245
But I'm pretty sure he got the message.

17:03.246 --> 17:05.537
Yeah, and the message was,
"She mad, we good."

17:05.538 --> 17:08.162
We need to find you somebody.

17:08.163 --> 17:10.994
Every dude in here got dry cornrows.

17:10.996 --> 17:11.996
That's a fact.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.412
Listen, bougie bitch,

17:13.413 --> 17:15.744
half of these dudes are cute, okay?

17:15.746 --> 17:17.412
- Where? Mm-mm.
- What?

17:17.413 --> 17:19.662
Let's just go stand by
them so they notice you.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.287
Since when did you
become Party McPartisan?

17:21.288 --> 17:23.162
I usually have to drag your ass out.

17:23.163 --> 17:25.662
- Come on, over here.
- What? Issa, where are we going?

17:25.663 --> 17:27.162
No. Jesus.

17:34.163 --> 17:37.412
? Crying on the bathroom
floor full of tears ?

17:37.413 --> 17:40.745
? My baby mama left me, said I
couldn't face my fears... ?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.620
No, let me finish. I got it.

17:45.621 --> 17:47.662
? Hey, yo, you a bitch... ?

17:47.663 --> 17:49.537
Ah, ah, ah.

17:49.538 --> 17:51.620
- Pop it. Yes. Yes.
- I'm not doing this.

17:51.621 --> 17:52.995
? Couldn't relive it ?

17:52.996 --> 17:54.537
? She got an iceberg heart ?

17:54.538 --> 17:57.120
? She just sunk my ship... ?

17:57.121 --> 17:58.787
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.162
Hey. How y'all ladies doing tonight?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.995
Good.

18:02.996 --> 18:04.120
I'm Jered, by the way.

18:04.121 --> 18:06.037
- Molly.
- Nice to meet you.

18:06.038 --> 18:07.537
- Issa.
- Uh...

18:07.538 --> 18:09.745
So, like, y'all performing?
What's going on?

18:09.746 --> 18:11.162
Oh, my God, no.

18:11.163 --> 18:13.412
We didn't even know it was
this kind of a party.

18:13.413 --> 18:15.412
- Oh, word.
- Are you performing?

18:15.413 --> 18:17.412
No. Hell, no. Hell, no. No, no, no.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.537
- Thank God.
- My little brother is.

18:19.538 --> 18:22.370
I don't know if this is really his
kind of crowd, you know what I mean?

18:22.371 --> 18:24.620
Oh, you mean he's not a gin and
juice, smoke weed every day,

18:24.621 --> 18:26.412
fuck bitches, get money kinda guy?

18:26.413 --> 18:30.037
Ha! He's more like a
skinny-jeans, juicing-type dude.

18:34.163 --> 18:36.912
Hey, give it up for Train Wreck.

18:36.937 --> 18:38.763
- So, your little brother?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.282
- Is he a poet?
- He's supposed to be up there soon.

18:40.307 --> 18:41.370
Yeah.

18:54.413 --> 18:55.413
Yo.

19:06.788 --> 19:08.412
Iss!

19:08.413 --> 19:10.371
Daniel? Whoa, hey!

19:12.163 --> 19:13.870
What are you even doing here?

19:13.871 --> 19:15.287
My friend's performing tonight.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.787
I produce some of his tracks.

19:16.788 --> 19:17.788
What are you doing here?

19:17.789 --> 19:19.662
Oh, um, my friend Molly

19:19.663 --> 19:22.287
had suggested, um, here, this place,

19:22.288 --> 19:23.662
where we are.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.120
What a coincidence.
How was your birthday?

19:26.121 --> 19:29.037
Oh, it was chill.
You know, nothing special.

19:29.038 --> 19:31.662
Well, we're celebrating tonight.
Let me get you a drink.

19:31.663 --> 19:32.663
Okay.

19:37.496 --> 19:41.287
- What you want?
- A vodka tonic.

19:41.288 --> 19:42.912
Two vodka tonics, man.

19:42.913 --> 19:45.537
? This is 'tween us,
you and I are committed ?

19:45.538 --> 19:47.870
? I'm the type of player
always rep my city ?

19:47.871 --> 19:50.287
? Step to the plate
like I'm a Ken Griffey ?

19:50.288 --> 19:52.995
? Grand slam, bringing
three hos home with me ?

19:52.996 --> 19:55.537
? Slide to home base, hit 450... ?

19:55.538 --> 19:58.412
Wait. I just don't understand
why these grown-ass men

19:58.413 --> 20:00.120
are still dressing like Kris Kross.

20:00.121 --> 20:02.412
I bagged you looking like Kris Kross.

20:02.413 --> 20:04.412
Okay, that was high school

20:04.413 --> 20:06.412
when I thought prison jeans were sexy,

20:06.413 --> 20:08.787
and you didn't bag me till
college, fuck you very much.

20:08.788 --> 20:11.287
I'm pretty sure my jeans
were still sagging then.

20:11.288 --> 20:14.870
Oh. Well, I'm just glad
your pants grew up.

20:14.871 --> 20:17.495
? Show me you can biddy up ?

20:17.496 --> 20:19.412
? Let me see you giddy up. ?

20:24.621 --> 20:26.287
Yo, remember when we used to rap?

20:26.288 --> 20:27.745
You still flow?

20:27.746 --> 20:30.620
You know, I might actually still write.

20:30.621 --> 20:32.620
You lying. You lying.

20:32.621 --> 20:34.787
All right, now. It's open mic night.

20:34.788 --> 20:36.870
So you rappers, singers,

20:36.871 --> 20:39.495
get it off your chest, all right?

20:39.496 --> 20:40.745
I dare you.

20:40.746 --> 20:42.287
No. I'm... nope.

20:42.288 --> 20:45.620
Come on, Iss. It was just your birthday.

20:45.621 --> 20:48.288
You're never gonna
have this moment again.

20:51.038 --> 20:52.870
You got this.

20:52.871 --> 20:55.663
You got this.

21:00.371 --> 21:02.037
What up, y'all?

21:04.788 --> 21:06.412
- You were polite.
- Yo.

21:06.413 --> 21:08.037
- Isn't that your girl?
- What?

21:08.038 --> 21:10.245
That's your girl, right?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.142
What the fuck?

21:15.663 --> 21:17.037
? Love rookie ?

21:17.038 --> 21:18.662
? She give them all the cookies ?

21:18.663 --> 21:20.162
? By cookies I mean pussy ?

21:20.163 --> 21:21.537
? This girl is kinda loosey ?

21:21.538 --> 21:23.037
? Dudes take her off the shelf ?

21:23.038 --> 21:24.662
? And they put her on credit ?

21:24.663 --> 21:27.745
? 30 days later,
they return it and regret it ?

21:27.746 --> 21:31.037
? Used like a dishrag,
dumped with a hashtag ?

21:31.038 --> 21:34.037
? I blame it on the pussy,
that shit must be bad ?

21:34.038 --> 21:35.788
? Broken pussy ?

21:37.288 --> 21:38.871
? Broken pussy ?

21:40.538 --> 21:42.037
? Maybe it's dry as hell ?

21:42.038 --> 21:43.412
? Maybe it really smells ?

21:43.413 --> 21:44.787
? Broken pussy... ?

21:44.788 --> 21:46.912
Oh, my God. She's talking about me.

21:46.913 --> 21:49.787
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

21:49.788 --> 21:51.163
? Broken pussy ?

21:52.996 --> 21:56.037
? Nobody wants you 'cause
you got a broken pussy ?

21:56.038 --> 21:58.870
? Nobody wants you
'cause you got a broken pussy ?

21:58.871 --> 22:02.037
- ? Broken pussy ?
- Crowd: ? Broken pussy ?

22:02.038 --> 22:03.662
? Broken pussy ?

22:03.663 --> 22:05.412
? Hey ?

22:05.413 --> 22:08.245
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

22:08.246 --> 22:10.037
? Broken pussy ?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.662
? Hey! ?

22:11.663 --> 22:14.412
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

22:14.413 --> 22:16.037
? Broken pussy ?

22:16.038 --> 22:18.912
? Hey, broken pussy. ?

22:18.913 --> 22:21.912
Thank you, guys.

22:21.913 --> 22:25.412
Girl, I'm sorry, okay?
It wasn't even about you.

22:25.413 --> 22:26.620
Daniel dared me to do it.

22:26.621 --> 22:27.870
And you know how we were talking

22:27.871 --> 22:29.412
about this being the last year of my 20s

22:29.413 --> 22:30.870
and how I need to make the most of it.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.412
I don't even know what came over me,

22:32.413 --> 22:34.037
but I just went up there

22:34.038 --> 22:36.287
and I just did that shit, you know?

22:36.288 --> 22:39.037
Oh! I mean, I don't know. You tell me.

22:39.038 --> 22:40.746
I thought I was pretty good up there.

22:45.288 --> 22:47.038
Mm-hmm.

22:53.788 --> 22:56.245
So, am I still spending the night,

22:56.246 --> 22:59.745
or no... t?

22:59.746 --> 23:02.287
Yo, can you shut the fuck up?!

23:02.288 --> 23:03.662
Damn!

23:03.663 --> 23:05.162
What did I say?

23:05.163 --> 23:07.662
The only reason we came to
that hoodrat-ass club tonight

23:07.663 --> 23:09.537
is so that you could
hook up with Daniel.

23:09.538 --> 23:11.162
I didn't even know
he was gonna be there.

23:11.163 --> 23:12.537
Just stop it. You knew.

23:12.538 --> 23:14.287
This was always about you.

23:14.288 --> 23:15.870
It was about you, too.

23:15.871 --> 23:18.912
Is my life a joke to you?
No, no, no, real talk.

23:18.913 --> 23:21.662
'Cause it's bad enough that I got
to deal with real triflin' niggas

23:21.663 --> 23:23.912
and real untraditional niggas
on a daily basis.

23:23.913 --> 23:26.995
Now I got to worry about dealing
with a triflin' best friend?

23:26.996 --> 23:29.912
You made a joke
of my heartbreak up there.

23:29.913 --> 23:32.745
I didn't mean to. I didn't
think about it like that.

23:32.746 --> 23:35.245
That's the damn problem, Issa. You don't
stop to think about the shit you do

23:35.246 --> 23:38.037
- can actually affect others.
- Are you kidding me?

23:38.038 --> 23:40.870
My whole life is about how
shit affects others, okay?

23:40.871 --> 23:43.245
My job, my boyfriend, you.

23:43.246 --> 23:44.912
I care about how shit affects you, too.

23:44.913 --> 23:46.037
I always listen to you.

23:46.038 --> 23:47.245
You only listen to me

23:47.246 --> 23:48.995
because I make you
feel better about you.

23:48.996 --> 23:51.537
Damn it. This is bullshit.

23:51.538 --> 23:53.362
- I didn't even want to go out tonight.
- _

23:53.387 --> 23:55.870
You drag me out here,
then I meet a decent dude,

23:55.871 --> 23:57.662
but you should've seen
how fast Jered left.

23:57.663 --> 23:59.412
- You're right.
- What if he was the one?

23:59.413 --> 24:00.778
- Oh, that's right, nigga.
- _

24:00.802 --> 24:02.042
I'll never know.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.537
Never know.

24:03.538 --> 24:06.662
Bitch, I know you did not just respond

24:06.663 --> 24:08.912
to that motherfucking text message.

24:08.913 --> 24:10.537
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

24:10.538 --> 24:12.537
Did you just send a text message?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.412
I swear on my brother's life and my life

24:14.413 --> 24:16.412
I did not send a text.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.662
Okay, now it's technically sent.

24:20.663 --> 24:23.245
- But Daniel, he disappeared...
- You know what, fuck you!

24:23.246 --> 24:24.787
And if you fuck Daniel,

24:24.788 --> 24:27.620
you're as much of a dumb bitch as I am.

24:27.621 --> 24:28.930
Fucking asshole.

24:28.954 --> 24:31.131
- Motherfucker, open the door!
- It's the child locks.

24:31.156 --> 24:33.620
- I was just playing with you.
- Shut the fuck up.

25:07.996 --> 25:10.787
Hey. Where you going?

25:10.788 --> 25:12.662
I shouldn't be here.

25:12.663 --> 25:14.370
Why? Come on.

25:14.371 --> 25:15.663
You're here.

25:23.163 --> 25:24.912
I got you this.

25:24.913 --> 25:28.287
Not Moscato, but some
shit Drake would like.

25:28.288 --> 25:30.037
Why are you assuming I like Drake?

25:30.038 --> 25:32.245
Every black girl that went
to college likes Drake.

25:32.246 --> 25:34.245
He just really gets us.

25:47.288 --> 25:48.912
I'm not a dumb bitch!

25:48.913 --> 25:50.788
I never said you were.

25:51.913 --> 25:54.120
No, you didn't.

25:54.121 --> 25:57.245
But I just got out of a
relationship, I think,

25:57.246 --> 26:00.495
and I-I wanna try being
this new, different person,

26:00.496 --> 26:01.995
and you seem like the perfect person

26:01.996 --> 26:03.495
to be this new, different person with

26:03.496 --> 26:05.370
because you've always
been my "what if" guy,

26:05.371 --> 26:08.162
but I... I can't just jump from
one relationship to another

26:08.163 --> 26:11.037
- because that's crazy...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:11.038 --> 26:12.913
Relationship?

26:14.413 --> 26:16.370
I'm not looking for a relationship.

26:16.371 --> 26:17.662
Maybe...

26:17.663 --> 26:20.163
maybe I gave you the wrong idea.

26:23.746 --> 26:24.996
No, you didn't.

26:26.788 --> 26:29.038
That's good to know.

26:49.538 --> 26:51.662
Bitch, you still mad?

26:51.663 --> 26:53.528
Bitch, you still trippin'?

26:57.163 --> 26:58.537
My...

26:58.538 --> 27:01.537
? Girlfriend. ?

27:01.538 --> 27:03.412
If you don't get off of me...

27:03.413 --> 27:05.412
Where is your bag?
'Cause I only see one.

27:05.413 --> 27:07.120
It's not under your big-ass wrap?
