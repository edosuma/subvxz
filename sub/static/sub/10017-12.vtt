00:31.126 --> 00:32.753
Bob, who's in?

00:32.961 --> 00:34.360
Dr. Greene...

00:35.263 --> 00:38.960
There's a guy in the street.
Gunshot wounds. Blood everywhere.

00:39.167 --> 00:42.193
All right. You heard the doctor.
Here we go.

00:43.205 --> 00:45.070
We got a GSW.

00:45.274 --> 00:49.005
It's on the street.
We're gonna need some hands out there.

00:49.212 --> 00:50.542
Clear Trauma 1.

00:50.747 --> 00:53.181
A patient's gonna strangle
on Christmas lights.

00:59.022 --> 01:00.786
- He's between the cars.
- I see him.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.823
Okay, I can see him.

01:07.397 --> 01:09.263
All right, he's still breathing.

01:09.434 --> 01:10.423
I got a pulse.

01:10.668 --> 01:13.262
We gotta get him out of here.
Lift him up.

01:14.472 --> 01:16.941
All right.
Easy! Watch his head.

01:17.141 --> 01:18.575
Joe, you got him?

01:22.348 --> 01:23.678
Bag him.

01:27.119 --> 01:30.987
Connie, notify the O.R., get Benton
and order eight units O-neg.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.385
Bob, call Security.
We got a gangbanger here.

01:33.559 --> 01:34.549
Gangbanger?

01:34.794 --> 01:36.762
Dial 4-3-2 and say, "Help!"

01:36.963 --> 01:39.158
Open the Trauma Care Unit!

01:40.000 --> 01:42.332
In winter, I wish they'd
dump the bodies inside.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.561
Yeah, pretty inconsiderate of them.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.566
Trauma 2, call the blood bank.
We need eight units of O-neg.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.971
And I need a page on Benton. Now.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.549
Get his clothes off.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.415
Gary, can you grab that?

02:03.291 --> 02:06.749
Abdomen, chest, neck, legs.

02:08.263 --> 02:09.856
Pulse 160 and thready.

02:10.065 --> 02:14.263
Decreased breath sounds hyperresonant
on the right. I'll decompress.

02:14.470 --> 02:15.528
Fourteen gauge?

02:15.737 --> 02:17.204
Get your souvenirs here.

02:17.406 --> 02:18.999
I'll get it out of here.

02:19.609 --> 02:20.974
Let's intubate him.

02:21.177 --> 02:22.735
Carter, jump in here.

02:22.945 --> 02:24.139
Me?

02:24.947 --> 02:27.142
You've seen 50 of these by now, right?

02:42.466 --> 02:44.900
Advance the blade to the epiglottis,
then lift.

02:46.537 --> 02:49.439
- I can't see a thing in here.
- Okay, I'll suction.

02:53.111 --> 02:56.946
Visualize the vocal cords,
and pass the tube through them.

02:59.452 --> 03:01.511
Stay away from that esophagus.

03:02.221 --> 03:03.415
Good.

03:08.427 --> 03:10.156
- You got it.
- Nice work, Carter.

03:10.362 --> 03:11.795
O.R.'s waiting.
What've we got?

03:11.998 --> 03:13.761
Tube's in. Let's go!

03:14.868 --> 03:17.735
Gunshot wounds to the neck,
chest, abdomen and legs.

03:17.938 --> 03:22.137
Intubated. Gave two liters of saline,
needs a thoracotomy and laparotomy.

03:22.342 --> 03:24.071
Clear that elevator!

03:24.278 --> 03:27.246
- I'd like to follow through the O.R.
- There'll be enough bodies there.

03:27.448 --> 03:29.780
- I haven't been there yet.
- I'll take him from here.

03:29.984 --> 03:31.679
I'm the one who found him.

03:31.887 --> 03:34.787
Well, you probably saved his life.
Let's go.

04:26.545 --> 04:29.708
We got a dead shovel in 2 and
a paper cut in the Suture Room.

04:29.881 --> 04:30.870
Paper cut?

04:31.083 --> 04:34.143
The guy says his newspaper jumped up
and attacked him.

04:34.353 --> 04:35.911
We're waiting for psych.

04:36.189 --> 04:40.683
Isn't it comforting to know that 1995
won't be any different than 1994?

04:40.893 --> 04:42.224
Excuse me. Carter?

04:42.728 --> 04:46.392
Can you call the medical examiner
to pick up the dead shovel in 2?

04:46.600 --> 04:47.725
What's a dead shovel?

04:47.935 --> 04:50.369
Fat man shoveling snow.

04:50.571 --> 04:54.905
Heart palpitations and a fractured
femur. She's waiting on the orthopods.

04:55.108 --> 04:56.769
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:57.444 --> 05:01.176
I've been here for hours now,
and I feel absolutely fine.

05:01.415 --> 05:04.613
Mrs. Davies is the mitral prolapse
with resolved SVT.

05:04.819 --> 05:07.151
Yeah, resolved and forgotten.

05:08.122 --> 05:09.111
Where's Dr. Lewis?

05:09.290 --> 05:11.054
She'll be with you
as soon as she can.

05:11.259 --> 05:14.388
I hope so. I have a 7-year-old
at home with the mumps.

05:14.596 --> 05:17.088
So do I.
Gets on your nerves, doesn't it?

05:18.499 --> 05:19.660
Thank you.

05:23.405 --> 05:24.873
You can do it.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.565
I can do it.

05:26.775 --> 05:28.971
Just swing on.

05:29.178 --> 05:32.706
You mean hang on?
I can't do it, Bob. I can't do it!

05:32.916 --> 05:34.781
Yes. Yes, you can!

05:34.985 --> 05:36.283
You okay?

05:36.486 --> 05:38.147
New Year's revolution.

05:38.355 --> 05:40.881
Resolution. I quit smoking.

05:41.092 --> 05:43.424
- She had a menthol.
- Menthols don't count.

05:43.628 --> 05:46.096
My resolution was
to quit doing scut work.

05:46.297 --> 05:48.162
After I take these to the lab.

05:48.366 --> 05:49.594
He failed. Why can't I?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.497
- Is Dr. Benton back from surgery yet?
- Been and gone!

05:52.703 --> 05:54.228
Thank you.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.435
This is gross!

05:56.642 --> 05:59.132
- Shut up, Stewey!
- No, you!

05:59.344 --> 06:00.333
You started it.

06:00.545 --> 06:03.708
Now stop it!
Let the doctor do his work!

06:03.916 --> 06:07.010
Perhaps Binky wants to wait outside.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.155
You know, Mrs. Bimley,
Stewey's eye is gonna be just fine.

06:10.356 --> 06:14.850
A word of caution: Keep all the guns,
even the paint guns, away from the kids.

06:15.061 --> 06:17.427
Well, obviously.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

06:17.630 --> 06:20.122
Come on, Stewey, let's go!
Binky!

06:24.004 --> 06:25.403
I got a bumsicle for you.

06:26.206 --> 06:28.333
Freeze-dried at the backdoor.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.601
- Let's clear Trauma 1.
- Got to go.

06:30.779 --> 06:31.767
Welcome back.

06:32.414 --> 06:34.938
I found him on 43rd Street.
Gilbert McCabe.

06:35.182 --> 06:37.480
Legs frozen to the sidewalk.

06:37.686 --> 06:40.018
I was just sleeping.

06:40.221 --> 06:41.848
I feel fine. Put me down.

06:42.057 --> 06:45.323
You can't even stand up.
We had to chip the ice with a tire iron.

06:45.794 --> 06:48.228
They woke me up is what they did.

06:48.464 --> 06:52.832
Mr. McCabe, my name's Dr. Greene.
This is Dr. Hicks.

06:53.035 --> 06:54.501
We're gonna check you over.

06:54.704 --> 06:57.434
I don't want some colored woman
working on me.

06:58.741 --> 07:01.438
Like I said, '95 is gonna be
just like '94.

07:01.645 --> 07:04.705
I said, put me down.
What are you, deaf?

07:04.915 --> 07:07.110
- Dr. Kayson.
- I'm very busy, Dr. Lewis.

07:07.317 --> 07:09.945
This'll just take a minute.
I've got a patient with...

07:10.153 --> 07:13.987
You'll have to wait. I've got
a patient coming out of surgery.

07:20.198 --> 07:22.325
Mrs. Davies,
everything checks out okay.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.468
Your heart rate's normalized.
We need to increase your verapamil.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.298
So I can go?

07:27.505 --> 07:30.201
Not until the attending cardiologist
gives the okay.

07:31.809 --> 07:34.711
Don't worry, you'll have time
for your daughter's mumps.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.040
They last a good seven days.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.215
You have to take them off.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.908
The hell I do.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.583
- You need Carter?
- Not if you do.

07:45.558 --> 07:47.651
Bowel disimpaction in 1.

07:48.193 --> 07:49.559
- How was surgery?
- Which surgery?

07:49.762 --> 07:52.561
- The gang kid from this morning.
- He died 10 minutes in.

07:52.766 --> 07:54.700
This is my surgical rotation.

07:54.901 --> 07:58.029
- Your ER surgical rotation.
- I haven't stepped foot in an O.R.

07:58.239 --> 07:59.866
You always treat students like this?

08:00.074 --> 08:02.907
Dr. Benton, I hate to complain,
but all I do is scut work.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.909
I did it for my surgical resident.
We all did.

08:06.113 --> 08:08.604
And you'll do it until
you can do it in your sleep.

08:08.816 --> 08:12.275
You are a medical student.
You're here to make my life easier.

08:12.486 --> 08:14.819
Yeah, I'm also here to learn.

08:15.157 --> 08:16.681
And have you?

08:17.492 --> 08:18.618
Learned?

08:21.196 --> 08:24.029
Glove up and dig in.
And don't take all day.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.139
- Can you feel anything here?
- Keep it where I can see it.

08:35.311 --> 08:36.299
Mr. McCabe.

08:36.879 --> 08:39.041
- Are you feeling anything here?
- Where?

08:39.248 --> 08:41.274
- How about that? You feel that?
- No.

08:42.219 --> 08:44.779
And don't touch those pants.

08:44.987 --> 08:46.546
- Now?
- No, nothing hurts.

08:46.757 --> 08:50.716
And don't get into those pockets.
I got all my money in those pockets.

08:51.061 --> 08:54.963
What do you keep poking for?
My feet feel fine.

08:55.166 --> 08:59.899
It's just that they're a little heavy.
Like a chunk of wood.

09:00.104 --> 09:03.665
And I wanna take those shoes with me.
Do you hear me?

09:03.875 --> 09:08.370
Connie, set up a morphine drip and
a gram of Ancef, and a tetanus booster.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.241
No. I don't want any drugs.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.349
Heparin, 5000 units.

09:12.551 --> 09:17.488
You have severe frostbite in your feet
and legs. Ice crystals in the tissues.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.320
We need to warm them up quickly
in a whirlpool bath.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.826
You mean like a Jacuzzi?

09:24.029 --> 09:25.656
Yeah, like a Jacuzzi.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.358
We'll see if there's any tissue damage
and decide if we need surgery.

09:29.570 --> 09:33.529
Oh, no, I won't need that! That's a
perfectly good pair of hoofers.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.505
Just need a little warming up,
that's all.

09:36.711 --> 09:38.941
Tell them I'm taking my clothes with me.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.876
I don't want some bonehead
stealing them.

09:43.484 --> 09:45.281
Mrs. Davies is 38 years old...

09:45.486 --> 09:48.353
...known history of recurrent,
easily controlled SVT.

09:48.556 --> 09:50.388
You should've released her hours ago.

09:50.592 --> 09:53.117
I tried to talk to you
on your way to recovery.

09:53.327 --> 09:56.297
You should've come to me
a long time before that.

09:56.498 --> 09:57.487
Hey, Susie!

09:59.468 --> 10:01.333
Not now, Chloe.
I did try to find you.

10:01.537 --> 10:02.937
I gotta tell you something.

10:03.138 --> 10:06.040
Hey, are you one of Susie's teachers?

10:06.241 --> 10:09.803
Here's your release.
Next time, Dr. Lewis, try harder.

10:10.947 --> 10:12.915
Oh, Mrs. Davies needs you.

10:14.651 --> 10:17.119
- Stop coming by.
- Let me tell you something.

10:17.321 --> 10:20.518
- It can't wait until tonight?
- I won't be here tonight.

10:20.724 --> 10:23.693
Ronnie and I are moving to Texas.
I've come to say goodbye.

10:24.628 --> 10:26.687
Susan, are you coming?

10:33.705 --> 10:35.138
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

10:35.340 --> 10:38.901
I don't know,
learn how to cook chili.

10:41.948 --> 10:43.005
This isn't funny.

10:43.214 --> 10:47.652
You and Ronnie are moving to Texas.
You're not even sure he can get a job.

10:47.852 --> 10:51.152
I told you, he's got an uncle
that works in a refinery.

10:51.357 --> 10:54.885
- Where are you going to live?
- I always figure that stuff out.

10:55.094 --> 10:57.893
You're pregnant.
It's a little different this time.

10:59.733 --> 11:02.065
This is crazy!
I don't think you should go.

11:02.269 --> 11:04.863
You want me, Ronnie and the baby
to stay with you?

11:12.647 --> 11:14.580
You don't even want me
to have the baby.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.744
I just think that you should...

11:17.952 --> 11:19.214
I want to, and I'm going to.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.383
At least stay in Chicago.
I'll talk to Mom and Dad...

11:23.558 --> 11:24.547
I don't want that!

11:24.760 --> 11:29.527
I don't want to stay with people that
always think I'm doing the wrong thing.

11:32.034 --> 11:36.130
I am gonna love this baby,
Susan, so much.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.871
And I want everyone else
to love it too.

11:45.315 --> 11:46.782
You gonna eat that?

12:00.231 --> 12:03.291
I'll send you a postcard
from the Alamo, okay?

12:08.507 --> 12:09.768
Chloe, wait!

12:13.245 --> 12:15.645
You don't even have a winter coat.

12:46.447 --> 12:47.710
Thanks.

12:48.048 --> 12:51.143
I'll wear it.
I'll wear it all the time.

13:31.061 --> 13:35.260
Give him a liter of Ringer's the
first hour, 16 line. Start a Foley.

13:35.466 --> 13:38.128
BP's 70 over 40.
Resps shallow at 28.

13:38.303 --> 13:39.964
Full thickness burns to both legs.

13:41.272 --> 13:43.173
Check who's covering plastics.

13:43.374 --> 13:46.037
- We need more sterile saline.
- Lydia's coming with it.

13:46.245 --> 13:49.146
- Third degrees to the scalp and face.
- Chest and abdomen burns are minor.

13:49.882 --> 13:52.214
- Burn Unit's notified, Mark.
- Thanks, Lydia.

13:52.384 --> 13:53.510
Pulse ox is 85.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.586
- Any other firemen hurt?
- No.

13:56.790 --> 13:57.915
Give him 10 of morphine.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.815
Want me to get rid of them?

14:00.026 --> 14:02.016
No, no. Let them stay.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.453
José, you're missing my point.

14:04.664 --> 14:07.929
We are not a pizza joint,
and we do not deliver.

14:08.134 --> 14:11.126
Okay, sure.
Take your business elsewhere.

14:11.672 --> 14:14.664
- Guy wants us to make house calls.
- How quaint.

14:14.875 --> 14:17.309
You have, Dr. Ross,
won the Pick Three Lotto.

14:17.511 --> 14:20.878
We got a runny nose in 1,
a cough and a sore throat in 4...

14:21.081 --> 14:24.278
...and babies having babies
over at Curtain Number 2.

14:24.486 --> 14:26.147
Babies it is.

14:27.422 --> 14:29.083
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

14:29.357 --> 14:31.086
So how was New Year's Eve?

14:31.293 --> 14:32.885
Sorry I didn't make it.

14:33.094 --> 14:36.530
Neither did we.
Walt and I fell out by 10:30.

14:38.401 --> 14:40.425
So what does he think
about your new job?

14:40.636 --> 14:43.070
He's happy.
Kids me about it all the time.

14:43.272 --> 14:47.437
Says working for Parks and Recs is
like being an urban forest ranger.

14:47.643 --> 14:49.941
Yeah, but I bet Mom's proud, right?

14:52.015 --> 14:54.209
That's what we need
to talk about, Peter.

14:54.418 --> 14:58.354
Walt and I saw this really nice place
across from Bryn Mawr Park.

14:58.555 --> 15:02.856
She'd have her own room, people to spend
time with her, nurses to look after her.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.323
What are you talking about?

15:04.528 --> 15:06.895
I don't think we can keep
caring for her.

15:07.097 --> 15:11.296
Since the stroke, she's been in and out.
She needs constant looking after.

15:11.603 --> 15:13.503
I don't know constant.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.799
You wouldn't know constant,
because you're never around.

15:17.008 --> 15:19.408
With this new job,
I'm not able to do it anymore...

15:19.612 --> 15:22.546
...and I don't want the kids to
take on that responsibility.

15:22.748 --> 15:26.912
Steven's in basketball, Joanie's doing
plays. I can't ask them to give it up.

15:27.119 --> 15:30.521
Why? Because that's what you did
when you were looking after me.

15:32.792 --> 15:37.194
When Mom went back to work,
we didn't have much choice, did we?

15:38.064 --> 15:40.828
I do have a choice about my own kids.

15:42.435 --> 15:43.663
Jackie...

15:45.372 --> 15:47.500
...there's gotta be something else.

15:48.276 --> 15:49.333
What about Mrs. Lukey?

15:50.478 --> 15:54.106
- She's only 3 years younger than Mom.
- She looked after that old man.

15:54.315 --> 15:57.751
She lives across the street.
She can come over and spend the days.

15:57.952 --> 15:59.943
I'll make the arrangements
to pay for it.

16:00.154 --> 16:01.781
Since when do you have extra money?

16:01.990 --> 16:03.821
Let me worry about that.

16:04.025 --> 16:06.391
Is this a done deal
just because you say so?

16:06.595 --> 16:11.532
Where have you been for the past 6 years
while Walt and I worried about it?

16:14.237 --> 16:16.034
I can't put her in a home.

16:17.273 --> 16:19.503
You won't have to.

16:19.742 --> 16:21.733
It's our decision.

16:22.345 --> 16:24.336
All of ours.

16:27.284 --> 16:30.184
It can't always be about
what you want, Peter.

16:34.224 --> 16:35.589
I'm gonna miss my bus.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.198
Doc...

16:50.875 --> 16:52.172
...what's the story?

16:52.377 --> 16:53.935
How's our boy?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.772
It's not great, guys.

16:56.948 --> 16:57.938
Sorry.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.517
<i>He's got full-thickness burns
to 60% of his body.</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:04.121
He needs to go up to the O.R.
For débridement...

17:04.323 --> 17:05.790
...and then to the Burn Unit.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.050
But he'll make it?

17:08.762 --> 17:10.729
I'll know more in about 12 hours.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.993
Okay, thanks, Doc.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.801
Dr. Greene, can I talk to you?

17:17.003 --> 17:19.063
Yeah, can I borrow your pen?

17:23.076 --> 17:25.306
I don't know if this is appropriate.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.181
I'm not sure Dr. Benton's
interested in supervising me.

17:29.384 --> 17:31.284
I'm fairly certain that he's not.

17:31.486 --> 17:34.455
So the warm, fuzzy demeanor's
not getting through to you?

17:36.157 --> 17:37.955
Yes, that would be accurate.

17:38.159 --> 17:40.128
I had a ton of residents like Benton.

17:40.329 --> 17:42.957
I think Benton had
a ton of residents like Benton.

17:43.165 --> 17:46.328
He's not the worst one you'll get.
My advice?

17:46.535 --> 17:47.627
Get used to it.

17:55.045 --> 17:57.377
Lydia, I need some help
with those teenagers.

17:59.616 --> 18:02.210
She can't.
She's on her way to Radiology.

18:03.753 --> 18:06.552
She's quitting smoking.
She's chewing nicotine gum.

18:06.756 --> 18:08.156
The whole pack?

18:20.338 --> 18:21.326
You okay?

18:27.680 --> 18:29.978
I've never seen anything like that.

18:32.485 --> 18:34.180
I just started...

18:35.287 --> 18:37.119
...three weeks ago.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.190
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

18:46.266 --> 18:48.632
I didn't think it would
scare me like this.

18:53.474 --> 18:55.237
You need to get some rest.

18:57.311 --> 18:59.074
Go home, okay?

18:59.546 --> 19:01.207
Get some sleep.

19:07.322 --> 19:08.584
Breathe.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.014
Breathe.

19:12.228 --> 19:13.786
The EKGs are normal?

19:13.996 --> 19:17.591
That's right. So are your blood tests,
chest x-rays and enzymes.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.495
No damage to the heart muscle.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.900
So what was this pain then?

19:24.006 --> 19:26.202
Probably muscular.

19:26.442 --> 19:29.844
You take all this time
just to tell me I pulled a muscle?

19:30.046 --> 19:32.344
So I take that
anti-inflammatory again?

19:32.549 --> 19:33.777
Again?

19:33.984 --> 19:37.442
A couple of months ago, my wife made me
clean the garage. Threw my back out.

19:37.821 --> 19:38.913
Two months ago?

19:39.123 --> 19:41.455
That's what I said.

19:41.659 --> 19:43.251
Oh, they gave you Feldene.

19:43.895 --> 19:46.022
Your pain's stopped.
You don't need to take it.

19:46.230 --> 19:47.527
So I'm out of here.

19:47.732 --> 19:50.200
I can't discharge you exactly yet.

19:50.401 --> 19:54.235
What's the deal? You said I was fine.
I've got three customers this afternoon.

19:54.439 --> 19:58.772
I'll run your tests by the cardiologist
on call. Then we can sign you out.

20:00.411 --> 20:02.437
- Have you seen Mark?
- Down one.

20:12.325 --> 20:13.690
It's okay, she's a nurse.

20:13.893 --> 20:17.260
Sorry. Chopper's setting down
in two minutes with an MVA.

20:17.464 --> 20:19.658
- Get Benton for it.
- He's still at lunch.

20:19.833 --> 20:20.821
Here's your pap tray.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.832
Thank you, Dr. Carter.
He's your man.

20:23.938 --> 20:25.405
Right this way.

20:28.642 --> 20:32.203
Paramedics are bringing in an MVA.
I need you to bring him down.

20:32.413 --> 20:33.676
Wait. By myself?

20:33.847 --> 20:34.836
Excellent!

20:35.783 --> 20:38.616
It's 34 degrees out.
You might want to get your coat.

20:39.221 --> 20:40.210
My coat.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.921
Carter, is there some kind
of emergency?

20:47.896 --> 20:49.057
All right, come on.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.181
All right. What've we got?

21:09.720 --> 21:11.085
MVA.

21:11.288 --> 21:13.347
School bus versus two-door.

21:14.157 --> 21:16.148
Blunt abdominal trauma.

21:17.595 --> 21:20.758
Twenty-five years old.
Pulse 150 and thready.

21:20.964 --> 21:22.193
BP 50 palp.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.697
- Go! Go!
- Couldn't intubate.

21:23.901 --> 21:24.890
Scooped and flew.

21:25.103 --> 21:26.195
All right.

21:26.404 --> 21:27.735
We'll take it.

21:33.712 --> 21:34.700
Cap refill's slow.

21:34.913 --> 21:37.108
- Sinus tach at 150.
- Run a strip.

21:37.283 --> 21:38.272
What've we got?

21:38.484 --> 21:40.748
MVA. Blunt trauma to the abdomen.

21:40.953 --> 21:41.943
Let's intubate.

21:42.121 --> 21:43.110
I got it.

21:43.322 --> 21:45.449
You help intubate.
I'll get X-ray down here.

21:47.394 --> 21:49.658
Okay, Mr. Carter, he's all yours.

21:50.397 --> 21:52.331
Connie, can I get a 7.5?

21:52.532 --> 21:56.435
Jim, it's Lily in the ER.
We need portable x-rays in Trauma 2.

21:56.636 --> 21:59.037
C-spine abdominal series to start.

21:59.239 --> 22:02.266
- Okay, thanks.
- Got some towels over here.

22:02.475 --> 22:05.445
He's got a lot of secretions in here.
I need some suction.

22:07.481 --> 22:08.470
Where's the O-neg?

22:08.649 --> 22:09.638
On its way.

22:10.618 --> 22:12.644
Advance the blade.

22:12.854 --> 22:14.947
Visualize the vocal cords.

22:15.157 --> 22:17.124
Pass through the tube.

22:19.661 --> 22:23.688
- How much fluid has he had?
- 2 liters in the field. This'll make 4.

22:23.899 --> 22:26.391
- I got it.
- Give me a suction cath.

22:26.868 --> 22:28.200
- Respirator?
- No, we'll bag him.

22:31.841 --> 22:34.742
His abdomen's rigid.
Peritoneal lavage?

22:35.745 --> 22:38.407
Would you like to do that also,
Mr. Carter?

22:38.882 --> 22:41.611
- No, you can do that one.
- Why, thank you.

22:42.052 --> 22:44.679
Don't bother, Peter.
I got a team scrubbing up.

22:44.888 --> 22:46.651
Move him upstairs.
Give me the bullet.

22:47.124 --> 22:49.820
MVA, 25 years old.
Brought in pale and diaphoretic.

22:50.027 --> 22:51.859
Pulse is 150, BP is 50 palp.

22:52.062 --> 22:54.054
Resp's 25. Intubated.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.255
Blunt abdominal trauma,
probable ruptured spleen.

22:56.867 --> 22:58.392
Thank you all.
We'll take it from here.

22:59.738 --> 23:00.830
Watch the line.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.667
- Watch that strap.
- We're clear.

23:04.409 --> 23:05.967
Excuse us, people.

23:09.415 --> 23:13.408
Morgenstern and I have a gallbladder
at 8 p.m. Scrub in by 7:30.

23:23.896 --> 23:28.027
We have made contact.
I repeat, we have made contact.

23:28.235 --> 23:31.762
- It was you who was looking for him, right?
- Yeah.

23:31.938 --> 23:32.927
Dr. Kayson.

23:33.141 --> 23:36.269
- I'm on my way to the lab.
- Then sign out Mr. Vennerbeck now.

23:36.477 --> 23:39.844
A 38-year-old admitted with
non-radiating left chest pain...

23:40.047 --> 23:41.536
...reproducible with movement.

23:41.749 --> 23:44.445
Tenderness left sternal border.
Resolved without treatment.

23:44.653 --> 23:46.177
- EKG's normal?
- Yes.

23:46.387 --> 23:48.218
- Enzymes, chest x-ray?
- Normal.

23:48.423 --> 23:50.153
- Dizzy? Palpitations?
- No.

23:50.359 --> 23:51.518
- Diaphoretic?
- No.

23:51.727 --> 23:53.388
- Hyperlipidemia?
- No.

23:53.595 --> 23:55.392
- History of chest pain?
- No, but...

23:55.597 --> 23:56.723
Risk factors?

23:56.932 --> 23:58.832
None, but slightly elevated
blood pressure.

23:59.034 --> 24:01.731
Doesn't sound cardiac.
Have him see his doctor.

24:01.937 --> 24:05.236
- Thank you, Dr. Lewis.
- Thank you, Dr. Kayson.

24:08.244 --> 24:11.645
You're free and clear. You need to see
your own doctor for a stress test.

24:11.848 --> 24:16.012
Great. Missed two appointments,
and you tell me to see my own doctor.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.881
Sorry it took so long.
We wanted to be thorough.

24:19.088 --> 24:22.058
Sure, sure. Thanks, okay?

24:22.259 --> 24:23.954
- I'll send a nurse in.
- Great.

24:24.161 --> 24:25.594
Dr. Lewis.

24:31.736 --> 24:35.467
When I was a resident, I was always
worried about people's approval.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.268
The attending, the patients.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.040
Maybe because I was a woman.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.713
A black woman.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.307
Life was a lot easier
once I got over it.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.419
Don't let the patients
get to you, Dr. Lewis.

24:48.621 --> 24:52.751
We treat them as soon as we can.
Don't apologize for how long it takes.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.894
We're a busy hospital,
not a restaurant.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.798
- Gaby started it.
- I did not!

25:04.004 --> 25:05.028
- You did too!
- Did not.

25:05.239 --> 25:07.833
Ladies, you're sisters.
We can work this out.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.271
Sally didn't want the name Emily.

25:10.477 --> 25:12.672
It's Grandma's name.
I always wanted it.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.906
You know, there are plenty
of other names.

25:15.115 --> 25:16.981
You don't even know if it's a girl!

25:17.185 --> 25:20.985
- Besides, I deliver a week earlier.
- Not if I have it induced!

25:21.189 --> 25:22.383
Coming through.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.251
Connie...
Get out of the way!

25:24.460 --> 25:26.724
Connie, get a CBC and a Chem-7.

25:26.929 --> 25:29.227
Get FHTs with a Doppler,
and call OB.

25:29.431 --> 25:31.695
Susan, are you bored?
Looking for something to do?

25:31.901 --> 25:34.665
Come on. Her name's Tarita.
She's 19 years old.

25:34.870 --> 25:37.304
She's complaining of abdominal pains.

25:37.507 --> 25:40.270
She needs Narcan
and an amp of glucose.

25:40.677 --> 25:43.339
Hook up the suction to a Yankaur.

25:44.514 --> 25:46.573
We need an amp of glucose.

25:47.183 --> 25:48.741
Narcan given.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.681
Where's that Doppler?

25:51.888 --> 25:54.483
BP's 70 over 30.
Resp's shallow at 8.

25:54.692 --> 25:56.683
Crank up the IV. She's somnolent.

25:56.894 --> 25:58.555
Pupils pinpoint. What's she on?

25:58.763 --> 26:00.492
Boyfriend says pills and cocaine.

26:00.698 --> 26:04.134
- Let's get a tox screen.
- She needs an amp of D-50 too.

26:06.805 --> 26:09.365
We'll help you, Tarita.
When is your due date?

26:09.574 --> 26:11.201
I don't know!

26:11.410 --> 26:12.740
Lie back, it'll be fine.

26:12.945 --> 26:14.879
I don't know. It's coming.

26:15.314 --> 26:16.714
She's fully dilated.

26:17.683 --> 26:18.877
<i>A 100% effaced.</i>

26:19.085 --> 26:20.746
Membrane's ruptured.
Get her to OB.

26:20.953 --> 26:22.319
I'll notify an ICU unit.

26:23.056 --> 26:26.355
Elderly couple's coming in.
Both comatose. ETA's 2 minutes.

26:26.558 --> 26:29.027
Benton's in surgery.
Dr. Hicks is on her way.

26:29.562 --> 26:31.963
Please hurry, it's coming!

26:32.967 --> 26:34.797
It's coming.

26:35.235 --> 26:38.295
- Just don't push. Don't push!
- Take short breaths.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.461
Screw you.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.541
Short breaths like you're
blowing out a candle. Good.

26:42.744 --> 26:46.941
- A foot's coming out, and it's blue.
- Back her up, and take her in here.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.342
Come on, people.

26:48.549 --> 26:50.346
Excuse us! Make way!

26:51.186 --> 26:53.950
Call OB. Tell them to
get down here right away.

26:56.391 --> 26:58.986
Can't get worse than a cocaine-toxic
footling breech.

26:59.194 --> 27:01.959
Yes, it can.
Umbilical cord's prolapsed.

27:02.164 --> 27:06.760
- Grab the monitors. Where're the leads?
- In the crash cart. Pull in a dynamap.

27:09.405 --> 27:11.430
- Are they gonna be okay?
- Who are you?

27:11.641 --> 27:15.441
I live next door. Their cat wanted in.
When I knocked, nobody answered.

27:25.956 --> 27:27.924
Her skin is cherry red
under the nails.

27:28.126 --> 27:30.617
O-2 at 15 liters.
Call Respiratory in here, stat.

27:30.827 --> 27:34.594
It's probably carbon monoxide poisoning.
Carol, do a sodium hydroxide test.

27:34.798 --> 27:36.824
Get a couple of test tubes
from the rack.

27:37.035 --> 27:38.400
Did they use any heaters?

27:38.603 --> 27:41.333
They got those little ones.
It's not oil, but...

27:41.539 --> 27:42.802
- Kerosene.
- That's it.

27:43.007 --> 27:44.441
We need a portable x-ray.

27:44.642 --> 27:47.578
They'll be okay? They lived
next door to me all of my life.

27:47.779 --> 27:49.714
They're like my grandparents.

27:50.349 --> 27:52.317
CO's present, both samples.

27:52.518 --> 27:53.610
Carboxyhemoglobin.

27:53.819 --> 27:55.343
Get the oxygen hooked up here.

27:55.554 --> 27:56.851
What kind of lab test you want?

27:59.592 --> 28:01.822
- Turn the warmer on.
- Who's on in NICU?

28:02.028 --> 28:03.289
Dizon was here earlier.

28:03.496 --> 28:05.259
You son of a bitch, it hurts.

28:09.335 --> 28:12.601
- Turn the warmer on.
- Good, I got the other leg. It's out.

28:12.807 --> 28:15.776
The baby usually rotates
to the spine anterior position.

28:18.312 --> 28:19.677
Shoulder blades are free.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.507
Okay, now rotate it sideways.

28:21.716 --> 28:23.775
Sweep the arms down over the chest.

28:23.984 --> 28:26.282
- What are you doing?
- Okay, here we go.

28:29.491 --> 28:31.459
He's tremulous. Suction.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.629
Breathe. Keep breathing.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.275
My baby.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.213
I'll stick a butterfly
in the scalp vein.

28:56.420 --> 28:59.184
Get me a heel stick glucose.

29:02.259 --> 29:04.625
Blood sugar's 25.

29:07.198 --> 29:09.290
- Any vaginal tears?
- Not too bad.

29:09.534 --> 29:11.195
Let me get some cord blood.

29:11.936 --> 29:15.963
Give him six milligrams of
10 percent DW over three minutes.

29:17.475 --> 29:21.207
Susan, didn't you just release a
patient named Vennerbeck?

29:22.448 --> 29:24.848
Honey, everything will be okay.
I just know it.

29:25.050 --> 29:27.041
- What happened?
- I don't understand.

29:27.253 --> 29:30.313
Severe substernal chest pain
radiating down the left arm.

29:30.523 --> 29:32.492
He's had five morphine...

29:32.691 --> 29:37.322
He's got a new holosystolic murmur with
a thrill. Give me an ET tube 7.5.

29:37.731 --> 29:42.668
- Why did you let him go?
- Start a 400 milligram dopamine drip.

29:46.807 --> 29:49.402
Will somebody please tell me
what is going on?

29:49.610 --> 29:52.545
38-year-old bounced back
with chest pain.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.078
Holosystolic murmur.

29:54.315 --> 29:58.480
Hypotensive with a possible
ventricular septal rupture.

29:58.686 --> 30:00.677
Give me 40 milligrams Lasix IV push.

30:00.889 --> 30:03.221
Doctor, please.
Tell me what is going on!

30:03.425 --> 30:07.622
Let's get him upstairs. Call the cath
lab to prep for intra-aortic balloon.

30:07.830 --> 30:09.593
Go! Come on, go!
All right.

30:09.798 --> 30:11.095
That'll be all, Dr. Lewis.

30:11.300 --> 30:14.235
All right. Mrs. Vennerbeck,
I'm Dr. Kayson.

30:14.436 --> 30:18.304
We need to take certain emergency
measures to stabilize your husband.

30:40.164 --> 30:41.961
Ms. Maryanski...

30:44.970 --> 30:49.430
Ms. Maryanski, I'm sorry it's not
the news that you wanted to hear.

30:50.075 --> 30:52.305
No, I want this baby.

30:56.082 --> 30:57.674
Is it your husband?

31:00.653 --> 31:02.678
He doesn't want to have the baby?

31:04.790 --> 31:05.985
Ms. Maryanski...

31:06.192 --> 31:10.926
...this is something that the two of
you, as a couple, really should discuss.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.065
He's infertile!

31:16.303 --> 31:17.361
Well...

31:19.573 --> 31:21.200
...in that case...

31:23.443 --> 31:25.571
...that, yeah, would be...

31:25.746 --> 31:29.183
These are the maxillary sinuses.
Opacification on the affected side...

31:29.384 --> 31:33.343
...is a subtle clue that the inferior
wall of the orbit is fractured.

31:34.556 --> 31:36.489
If this isn't a good time...

31:37.392 --> 31:38.985
Sorry, it's been a long day.

31:39.194 --> 31:43.858
Actually, I'm scrubbing with Dr. Benton
on a gallbladder in 7 minutes.

31:44.066 --> 31:46.864
Well, if I know Dr. Benton,
he'll be early.

31:47.069 --> 31:48.730
Better get out of here.

31:49.538 --> 31:51.336
Remember these three things:

31:51.541 --> 31:53.805
Cystic duct, common duct, liver.

31:54.878 --> 31:56.345
Get out of here.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.818
They're asleep.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.555
You scared me.

32:12.763 --> 32:14.094
Sorry.

32:14.699 --> 32:18.227
Their blood gases have normalized.
Their CO levels are down.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.201
They're gonna be fine.
They're on a 23:59 hold.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.637
Well, I just wanted to check on them
before I head out.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.171
Mr. Babcock owned a bakery.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.348
Started it the year they were married.

32:30.550 --> 32:32.745
He still makes a three-tiered cake...

32:32.952 --> 32:35.647
...every June 14th on their anniversary.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.054
They got lucky today.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.987
I think maybe they've been
lucky every day.

33:03.685 --> 33:04.743
Carter...

33:06.453 --> 33:09.014
Don't butt in backwards.
You're not sterile yet.

33:10.792 --> 33:14.125
Turn on the faucet with your knee.
Pop open a brush packet.

33:21.137 --> 33:22.832
Come on, get it open.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.434
Good.

33:27.843 --> 33:31.280
Now, get your hands wet,
starting with your fingernails.

33:31.481 --> 33:33.813
Scrub your fingers 10 times.

33:34.017 --> 33:35.917
Front, side...

33:36.119 --> 33:38.212
...back, webbing.

33:38.723 --> 33:39.848
Like this?

33:42.126 --> 33:43.149
Yeah, sort of.

33:43.361 --> 33:44.953
Then scrub the palm 10 times.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.254
Back of the hands...

33:47.465 --> 33:49.194
...down the arm...

33:49.400 --> 33:51.595
...front, side...

33:51.804 --> 33:54.431
...back, up to the elbows.

33:56.908 --> 33:58.399
Then rinse...

33:59.011 --> 34:01.309
...so that the water runs
down your arms...

34:01.513 --> 34:03.572
...not your hands. You got it?

34:05.384 --> 34:06.374
Yeah, I think so.

34:07.052 --> 34:09.487
Good. Remember, 10 times.

34:09.688 --> 34:11.121
And hurry up.

34:11.324 --> 34:13.018
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.531
Good, just pull it right back.

34:19.732 --> 34:22.725
Sometimes I like to pull
the thing back and hold it.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.097
Get it out of your way.

34:24.304 --> 34:25.737
- There you go.
- All right.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.908
Let it spring right back.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.132
Good.

34:34.415 --> 34:35.973
So you saw a piano showroom?

34:36.183 --> 34:40.917
Yeah, a piano showroom, right on
the Expressway. Drove right by it.

34:41.123 --> 34:43.614
It's...
Let's Bovie this bleeder.

34:43.824 --> 34:45.485
What's so strange about that?

34:45.694 --> 34:49.790
I've been driving that same route home
every night for six years...

34:49.998 --> 34:52.559
...and I never even saw it
until last night.

34:52.768 --> 34:54.429
But there it was...

34:54.636 --> 34:57.002
...on the Eisenhower,
right off Central.

34:57.206 --> 34:59.697
Well, I guess that is strange.
Scalpel.

34:59.909 --> 35:03.311
Okay. Now divide the
anterior rectus fascia.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.540
Yeah, let's Hoover that puppy.

35:07.151 --> 35:08.243
Good, good.

35:08.451 --> 35:09.749
Shirley, is it hot in here?

35:09.953 --> 35:12.751
No, Dr. Morgenstern. I think it
must be the change of life.

35:12.956 --> 35:14.651
Pianos on the Expressway?

35:14.858 --> 35:16.417
Thank you, Shirley.
You may go now.

35:16.627 --> 35:18.356
Let's zap that guy, will you?

35:19.263 --> 35:22.131
Mr. Carter.
Glad you could join us.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.160
Tonsil clamp.

35:24.369 --> 35:28.135
Peter, divide the rectus,
then grab the posterior rectus sheath.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.238
Straight arms.

35:30.441 --> 35:31.807
Good. Very good.

35:37.615 --> 35:38.674
Right hand.

35:39.151 --> 35:40.140
Right hand.

35:40.352 --> 35:42.752
Sorry, I thought you meant
your right hand.

35:42.955 --> 35:44.685
No, your right hand.

35:48.528 --> 35:49.517
Left hand.

35:49.729 --> 35:51.594
Grab it.
We'll straighten it up.

35:52.399 --> 35:53.764
Good. Spin.

35:56.770 --> 35:57.964
Still with us, Carter?

35:58.138 --> 35:59.662
Yeah, right here.

36:00.841 --> 36:02.102
You're done.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.236
Okay, there's the fundus.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.673
Okay, grab it.

36:07.882 --> 36:09.076
Dr. Benton...

36:09.817 --> 36:10.977
What is it, Carter?

36:11.185 --> 36:12.174
Where should I stand?

36:12.421 --> 36:14.582
Not right there.
And don't touch my shoulder.

36:14.790 --> 36:18.453
You just contaminated yourself.
Shirley, will you take him out?

36:21.663 --> 36:23.894
Want to play a round
of foreign capitals?

36:26.001 --> 36:27.833
You know, I hate this game.

36:33.810 --> 36:34.902
Yes! Doug!

36:35.144 --> 36:36.634
Yes! Doug!

36:37.715 --> 36:38.703
No!

36:38.982 --> 36:40.415
No, no, no!

36:41.652 --> 36:43.176
Don't move.

36:52.896 --> 36:54.592
What was your name again?

36:55.966 --> 36:59.334
Someday I'm gonna believe
that line out of you.

36:59.537 --> 37:01.266
What are you talking about?

37:01.473 --> 37:05.205
Can you remember the names of
all the women you've slept with?

37:06.211 --> 37:07.200
No.

37:07.412 --> 37:09.573
So someday you'll forget mine.

37:09.781 --> 37:12.546
Now you're assuming
that we won't last.

37:13.219 --> 37:14.277
Well...

37:15.921 --> 37:17.218
...yeah.

37:19.759 --> 37:20.885
Where are you going?

37:21.093 --> 37:23.357
I've got that conference
in the morning.

37:25.999 --> 37:30.368
We treated this older couple today.
They were married 48 years.

37:31.705 --> 37:35.072
- They seemed pretty happy about it.
- That's them, not us.

37:35.276 --> 37:36.903
How do you know?

37:37.377 --> 37:38.606
How did they know?

37:38.812 --> 37:42.442
Because if it were us,
we wouldn't be doing this.

37:42.984 --> 37:44.417
We'd both be married...

37:44.619 --> 37:46.280
...have daughters in Girl Scouts...

37:46.521 --> 37:49.047
<i>... be renting The Lion King.</i>

37:49.958 --> 37:53.621
We'd never have met, because we'd
already be committed to somebody else.

37:54.295 --> 37:55.285
Don't you want that?

37:56.799 --> 37:58.165
Not now.

37:59.134 --> 38:00.761
Not with me?

38:01.338 --> 38:02.702
Same thing.

38:04.139 --> 38:06.199
Then why don't I want it?

38:06.408 --> 38:08.309
Because you are afraid.

38:08.511 --> 38:10.376
- Most men are afraid.
- Of what?

38:11.047 --> 38:14.744
Responsibility, aging, death...

38:15.585 --> 38:18.919
...diminished sexual capacity.

38:22.727 --> 38:23.989
See you.

38:32.938 --> 38:34.131
Iceland?

38:34.339 --> 38:35.703
Reykjavik.

38:36.541 --> 38:38.270
Don't move.

38:38.477 --> 38:39.842
Belarus.

38:41.046 --> 38:42.105
Minsk.

38:44.049 --> 38:47.542
Okay, pack off the colon,
duodenum and stomach.

38:48.787 --> 38:50.085
Suction.

38:52.659 --> 38:53.852
Zaire.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.057
Kinshasa.

39:05.939 --> 39:08.737
Perhaps your student
should step a little closer.

39:08.942 --> 39:10.739
Yeah, I guess you're right.

39:11.246 --> 39:12.645
We're all packed off here.

39:12.847 --> 39:13.972
Peel it like a pear.

39:15.582 --> 39:18.984
Grab at the ampulla,
and dissect Calot's triangle.

39:20.088 --> 39:21.078
Mr. Carter.

39:22.424 --> 39:24.654
Can you tell us what defines
Calot's triangle?

39:28.563 --> 39:31.158
The cystic duct, the common duct
and the liver?

39:37.106 --> 39:38.904
Hold this retractor, will you?

39:40.776 --> 39:42.768
Let's get a little Bovie here.

39:45.782 --> 39:47.272
Mr. Carter.

39:48.351 --> 39:52.185
Have you ever noticed the piano showroom
on the Eisenhower Expressway?

39:54.758 --> 39:58.354
And so then she blurts out,
"He's infertile."

40:01.065 --> 40:04.364
Susan, that's my best story
of the new year.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.263
Sorry, it's just been another
incredibly hateful day with Kayson.

40:09.808 --> 40:13.243
Well, you buy into it. You can't
let him ride you like that.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.674
I put salt on them.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.610
Shouldn't eat salt.

40:18.217 --> 40:20.117
- What are you doing?
- I need more Tabasco.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.219
- You haven't tasted them yet.
- Don't need to.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.914
- But if you haven't tasted them...
- You have a problem with this?

40:26.526 --> 40:28.619
No. Absolutely not.

40:30.998 --> 40:33.557
Saw Chloe wandering
around the halls today.

40:33.766 --> 40:35.860
She was so calm
I hardly recognized her.

40:36.035 --> 40:37.024
Thanks, Mark.

40:37.204 --> 40:38.363
Sorry, that was stupid.

40:39.305 --> 40:43.072
They're moving to Texas. Ronnie will
dig for oil, and she'll have his baby.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.768
Assuming it is his baby.

40:44.945 --> 40:46.537
Why don't they stay here?

40:46.747 --> 40:49.683
- I told her to get an abortion.
- Why'd you do that?

40:49.884 --> 40:53.047
- Because I think she should.
- That's not very supportive.

40:53.255 --> 40:54.347
Supportive of what?

40:54.556 --> 40:57.582
My sister's fantasy of having a child?

40:58.059 --> 40:59.924
She thinks it's like having a pet.

41:00.129 --> 41:02.824
A little puppy who will follow her
and love her forever...

41:03.031 --> 41:06.057
...who won't care that she's
an alcoholic and abuses drugs...

41:06.269 --> 41:09.830
...that she gets diseases from
sleeping with every guy on the corner.

41:10.039 --> 41:12.507
This baby may turn her around.
You don't know.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.938
Like the one we delivered
this afternoon?

41:15.144 --> 41:17.442
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Well, I do.

41:17.647 --> 41:20.378
No, you don't. That's the point.
None of us do.

41:20.584 --> 41:23.644
Chloe and the baby will have a chance.
Who are you to decide?

41:23.854 --> 41:26.049
I'm her sister.
I pick up the pieces.

41:26.257 --> 41:27.382
It's still her choice.

41:27.591 --> 41:31.926
I would support it if she'd ever taken
any responsibility for her life...

41:32.129 --> 41:33.495
...before taking on another.

41:37.302 --> 41:39.327
I love her, but she
can't even part her hair.

41:39.537 --> 41:43.496
So do I think she should bring a child
into this world? No, I do not.

42:05.932 --> 42:07.229
Kayson?

42:13.808 --> 42:16.242
Vennerbeck is dead, Dr. Lewis.

42:18.512 --> 42:20.036
Oh, God.

42:20.781 --> 42:23.545
I've reviewed his file.
He shouldn't have been released.

42:24.285 --> 42:25.446
You approved it.

42:25.653 --> 42:26.951
I didn't have all the information.

42:27.155 --> 42:28.280
What information?

42:28.490 --> 42:30.287
Two months ago he had back pain.

42:30.492 --> 42:32.551
The diagnosis was musculoskeletal.

42:32.761 --> 42:35.628
It was atypical angina,
and you should've told me.

42:35.831 --> 42:39.393
- You didn't ask for his medical history.
- Do I have to ask for everything?

42:40.302 --> 42:41.565
What are you suggesting?

42:41.771 --> 42:45.298
I am suggesting this case was
more complicated than you thought.

42:45.942 --> 42:48.433
That your experience
was not sufficient...

42:48.645 --> 42:51.842
...to either determine that
or to present it to those who could.

42:52.048 --> 42:53.515
I presented what you asked for.

42:53.717 --> 42:55.809
But not the entire picture!

42:56.020 --> 42:58.045
And because of that, a man is dead.

42:58.254 --> 43:00.917
And his wife is
consulting their attorney.

43:05.263 --> 43:07.423
Dr. Morgenstern is aware
of this situation.

43:07.632 --> 43:10.567
And I have requested
a full case review.

43:14.005 --> 43:17.567
Susan, EMT's pulling up.
Woman in respiratory arrest.

43:18.305 --> 43:24.678
