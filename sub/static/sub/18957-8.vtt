WEBVTT

00:06.560 --> 00:08.189
Listen, if you're having
any second thoughts,

00:08.260 --> 00:10.290
you want to call this off,
now is the time.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.800
I don't want
to call it off.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.300
So no "We're going
anywhere" last looks.

00:20.370 --> 00:24.370
No tears, no "I'll miss you
most of all, Scarecrow."

00:24.440 --> 00:26.340
Nothing that anybody
can look back on.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.210
Look, I know
how to play my part.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.150
After you force me
to open up the safe,

00:31.220 --> 00:32.650
you can't go straight
for the cash box.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.520
You got to grab some
of the other shit, too.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.520
Yeah? Like what?

00:35.590 --> 00:37.350
Anything.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.720
It can't look like
you got tipped off

00:39.790 --> 00:40.860
what to take.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.460
Take the cash box last.

00:43.530 --> 00:46.630
That'll be my signal
to go for the shotgun.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.100
I'll try not to fire.

00:52.270 --> 00:53.700
You know
how adrenaline can be.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.940
Yeah, well, you won't
get a shot off,

00:56.010 --> 00:57.540
but thanks
for the concern.

00:57.610 --> 00:58.640
You just worry about

00:58.710 --> 01:00.940
making it all look
good for the camera

01:01.010 --> 01:03.150
and making sure
you're alone.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.180
I'll be alone.

01:16.390 --> 01:19.960
What I told you about
Amanda's mother is true.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.570
Her name was Alice.

01:21.630 --> 01:23.030
She was my friend.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.270
What I did not tell you

01:25.340 --> 01:27.170
was she was a grifter.

01:27.970 --> 01:28.940
After she died,

01:29.010 --> 01:30.170
Amanda moved in

01:30.210 --> 01:31.580
with Marius and me.

01:33.410 --> 01:35.710
A few months later,
Marius...

01:37.180 --> 01:40.420
found another partner
and took off.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.220
He'd say it was because
I lost focus, but...

01:45.720 --> 01:47.460
I think it was because
of the way he grew up.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.790
He didn't like the idea
of a kid-around life.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.900
Anyway, I got off the grift.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.370
I met you.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.200
And I never saw him again.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.700
I swear to God
I never saw him again

02:00.770 --> 02:02.310
until he showed up here
a few days ago.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.970
You could be conning me
right now.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.480
No, no. No.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.750
Don't touch me. Don't--

02:08.810 --> 02:09.780
But--

02:12.650 --> 02:16.790
I swear to you that this...
is real. Okay?

02:16.850 --> 02:20.720
You are what...

02:20.790 --> 02:21.960
is important to me.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.330
Listen, Pedro, I love you.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.230
You know what's real
right now, honey?

02:26.230 --> 02:27.400
What?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.000
What's real is the cop

02:30.070 --> 02:31.400
we have tied up
in the basement.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.140
When Marius calls,
we can let him go.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.500
The cop does not
care about us.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.140
- I swear to God--
- How do you know that?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.940
It seems to me...

02:39.910 --> 02:41.380
we let him go.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.250
Best case...

02:45.280 --> 02:46.450
prison,

02:46.520 --> 02:48.620
my business destroyed,

02:48.690 --> 02:51.460
and Family Services
takes Amanda.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.760
- No.
- I won't let that happen.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.290
- Hey.
- Hey, Pete.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.730
I'm just going out.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.630
Where to?

03:32.700 --> 03:35.200
I was gonna go, uh,
go see my friend--

03:35.300 --> 03:37.370
- you know, the married one.
- Yeah.

03:37.430 --> 03:40.440
Yeah, I thought--
I thought maybe...

03:40.500 --> 03:42.970
you were going out to slash
another one of my tires.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.380
Huh?

03:50.550 --> 03:52.820
The liquor store
across the street--

03:54.020 --> 03:55.420
they have
a security camera.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.660
I saw you.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.120
Why?

04:01.190 --> 04:02.930
Fucking why, huh?

04:02.990 --> 04:04.460
Why? Don't you fucking say

04:04.530 --> 04:05.830
that it was
about this trunk thing

04:05.900 --> 04:08.000
because I already apologized
to you for that, okay?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.600
Porta-Potty.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.800
What? What?

04:14.870 --> 04:16.209
Fucking what?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.110
When I was leaving
the bar that night,

04:18.170 --> 04:20.339
all I could think about...

04:20.339 --> 04:22.780
was the time you tipped
over the Porta-Potty

04:22.850 --> 04:23.850
while I was in it.

04:25.110 --> 04:26.350
W--

04:28.890 --> 04:30.020
Okay.

04:30.090 --> 04:34.360
Fuck me. I was an asshole
to you when we were kids.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.230
But we're not fucking
kids anymore, Pete.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.060
I could lose my fucking
career over this.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.260
- Yes, you are.
- What?

04:40.360 --> 04:42.670
- Still a kid.
- What are you-- What?

04:42.730 --> 04:44.830
I might have slashed
your tire.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.770
That's shitty,
but it's what I did.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.940
What I didn't do

04:49.010 --> 04:51.940
was make you beat the piss
out of that kid.

04:52.010 --> 04:54.010
Who are you?

05:01.020 --> 05:03.220
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

05:03.290 --> 05:04.390
Nothing.

05:04.450 --> 05:05.820
It was all
a misunderstanding.

05:16.070 --> 05:19.740
You're family,
for Christ's sakes.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.410
There's nothing in the world
more important than that.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.020
Fucking animal.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.060
Marius?

05:42.160 --> 05:43.430
Eddie?

05:43.490 --> 05:44.960
Wait a minute.
How'd you get a phone?

05:45.030 --> 05:47.430
I told Karolina if I didn't
talk to you that I was out.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.270
Eddie, this is--
this is really dangerous.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.440
He's fucking
killing me, man.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.640
Look...

05:53.670 --> 05:55.200
I know you're scared,

05:55.270 --> 05:56.970
but I'm going to have
the cash tomorrow, all right?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.540
I'm going over
to this crooked lawyer.

05:58.610 --> 05:59.940
He's got
the hundred thousand.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.610
Look, I'm not calling
for a pep talk, all right?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.680
I am literally over it.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.010
I just want to let you know
I'm not letting them

06:05.080 --> 06:06.620
cut any more pieces
off me, man.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.820
What's that mean?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.320
It means next time
I'm fighting back.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.220
I'm pretty sure
I can get a knife

06:11.290 --> 06:12.460
from under the bar.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.160
Eddie, don't be stupid.

06:14.220 --> 06:15.660
They'll kill you.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.190
You understand me?

06:17.260 --> 06:19.100
Yeah. Well, they're
gonna have to.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.770
Listen, you better stick
to the fucking plan.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.700
Otherwise, we're all dead.

06:23.770 --> 06:24.830
I'm sticking to the plan.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.140
I'm sticking
to the fucking plan.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.670
I just want to let you know

06:28.740 --> 06:30.910
that if for any reason
you don't beat the clock--

06:30.970 --> 06:32.780
I'm-- I'm gonna
beat the clock.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.380
I'm telling you.
That's what I'm saying.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.780
What if you don't?

06:44.520 --> 06:45.960
Just go.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.760
Just go, man.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.830
They're going to kill me
one day anyway, Marius.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.570
Fuck it.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.270
It might as well
be tomorrow.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.010
Eddie, don't-- Can you--

07:03.070 --> 07:04.140
I got to go.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.880
Fuck. Fuck.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.930
You were in there
a while, Eddie.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.230
I was just--

07:41.180 --> 07:43.610
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you guys.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.280
If it's a big one,
take it upstairs.

07:46.350 --> 07:49.190
Christ,
did you even spray?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.290
- No. There was--
- Look at you.
You look like shit.

07:51.350 --> 07:52.420
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

07:52.560 --> 07:53.890
- I feel--
- What is it,

07:53.960 --> 07:55.320
first night back jitters
or something?

07:55.390 --> 07:56.360
- Maybe. Maybe.
- All right.

07:56.430 --> 07:57.760
Well, just relax, okay?

07:57.830 --> 07:59.400
This is probably inevitable.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.600
Look, I'm gonna put Tate
on the big table.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.600
You can deal razz
to those English pricks.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.200
- No. No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.600
Yeah, that's what we're
going to do.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.100
- You sure?
- I need your head right

08:08.170 --> 08:10.870
before dealing to Mukherjee.
tomorrow night, all right?

08:10.940 --> 08:12.440
- All right, yeah.
- You feel okay?

08:12.580 --> 08:13.480
Yeah. I--

08:13.580 --> 08:14.910
I'm depending on you.

08:14.980 --> 08:16.110
All right.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.250
All right, come on,

08:17.310 --> 08:18.680
the rest of you,
let's go.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.580
We got folks coming
in a few minutes.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.270
..expressing-- you're
praising the Lord today.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.770
- It's so pretty.
- I got to go.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.170
That's convenient.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.610
- What?
- Where?

10:26.680 --> 10:28.610
Uh, town. I'm meeting
some friends.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.910
How are you getting there?

10:29.980 --> 10:31.480
Well, I was hoping
to get a ride

10:31.550 --> 10:32.780
from either Grandpa or Taylor,

10:32.850 --> 10:34.120
but obviously
that's a no-go.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.820
Since when do they
pass up Sunday brunch?

10:35.890 --> 10:36.850
Your grandfather's
at the office,

10:36.920 --> 10:37.950
and Taylor's busy.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.160
Too busy to save
his immortal soul?

10:40.220 --> 10:41.290
Funny.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.360
But not the part

10:42.430 --> 10:43.630
where you burn
in hell.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.430
I liked the sermon
this morning.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.000
Oh, nice pandering.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.200
I'm serious.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.000
Okay, okay, first off,
it was a homily.

10:51.070 --> 10:52.800
Sermons
are for Protestants.

10:52.870 --> 10:54.200
Filthy heathens.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.810
We're glad you came.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.940
I was glad to be included.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.440
While you're here,
would you mind

10:59.510 --> 11:00.980
looking at some
paperwork for me?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.810
No such thing
as a free brunch.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.850
We have to pick up
the kids from my folks.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.420
On it. Stay with Audrey.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.580
Earn some Brownie points.

11:07.650 --> 11:08.750
Can I get a ride?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.620
I mean, I can always hitch.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.890
Maybe get picked up

11:11.960 --> 11:13.960
by some harmless-looking
guy in a panel van.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.190
Go get ready. Wheels up
in five minutes.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.790
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the car.

11:17.860 --> 11:19.430
Meaning you'll be
having a cigarette.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.400
I'll be having a cigarette.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.870
Ohh now.

11:32.510 --> 11:33.610
You smoke?

11:33.680 --> 11:34.910
Only crack.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.250
Hey, I got to talk
to you about something.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.390
But it's not good.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.420
There you are.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.600
I had a dream
about you.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.570
Yeah? Hope a good one.

11:56.630 --> 11:59.070
There was some kind of...

11:59.140 --> 12:00.640
disaster--

12:00.800 --> 12:02.440
nuclear, maybe,
I don't know.

12:04.910 --> 12:07.180
Seemed like the whole
world was burned.

12:09.050 --> 12:11.110
And I was looking for you.

12:13.050 --> 12:15.080
I couldn't find you,
and I was...

12:16.390 --> 12:17.950
I was calling your name.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.830
So not a good one.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.840
You've been working
too hard.

12:32.900 --> 12:36.670
So why don't we stay
in bed all day?

12:36.740 --> 12:39.280
Order some food in.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.180
Watch movies.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.260
What? What is it?

12:55.490 --> 12:56.860
It's Sunday.

12:56.930 --> 12:59.960
Yeah.
I know what day it is.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.870
Yeah, it's Marius'
deadline.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.300
Yeah. I know that, too.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.410
If you
ruin Eddie's hands,

13:10.470 --> 13:13.210
you'll never get a chance
to expose Mukherjee.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.950
So you want me
to give Eddie a pass.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.350
Yeah.

13:31.530 --> 13:33.600
Hey, tell me something.

13:33.660 --> 13:34.700
Yeah.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.670
I need to ask you
something,

13:36.730 --> 13:38.900
and I want you
to be honest with me.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.500
Of course.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.510
Do you still care
about Marius?

13:52.320 --> 13:53.920
No.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.990
Marius ran.

13:59.660 --> 14:01.560
Leaving you with me.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.630
Maybe I should
thank him. You know?

14:24.810 --> 14:26.280
Well?

14:27.350 --> 14:28.620
Well, what?

14:30.820 --> 14:32.160
Well, isn't there
any part of you

14:32.220 --> 14:34.490
that has a bad feeling
about this?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.600
You thought Lance
was cheating on you

14:39.660 --> 14:40.960
with some lady named Victoria.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.200
I jumped to the wrong
conclusion.

14:42.270 --> 14:44.970
Victoria's a character
he created

14:44.970 --> 14:46.870
- to scam Grandma.
- Do you have any idea

14:46.970 --> 14:48.970
how fucking preposterous
that sounds?

14:49.010 --> 14:50.610
That doesn't
make it untrue.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.310
Carly, move it!

14:53.380 --> 14:56.610
Lance claims to have lost
more money than Audrey

14:56.680 --> 14:57.980
on that deal,

14:58.050 --> 14:59.850
yet he's buying a boat.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.420
Where is he getting
the money from?

15:01.480 --> 15:03.350
For fuck's sake,
let's ask him.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.990
Ask a question,
you get an answer.

15:05.020 --> 15:07.690
That doesn't necessarily
get you the truth.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.060
I can get you the truth.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.060
I just need a day.

15:16.330 --> 15:18.470
- That's it?
- That's it.

15:18.530 --> 15:19.500
And one more thing.

15:40.590 --> 15:41.560
Can I help you?

15:49.500 --> 15:50.430
Ex--

15:51.500 --> 15:52.700
Ex-Ex-Ex--

15:52.770 --> 15:54.370
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

15:54.440 --> 15:58.270
This is private property.
You can't just sit here.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.180
Hello.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.730
Yeah. Chayton. Chayton.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.260
This is Otto Bernhardt.

16:20.330 --> 16:21.330
Listen--

16:21.400 --> 16:23.530
Well, there's a fellow
here in my office,

16:23.600 --> 16:24.970
and he refuses to leave.

16:25.070 --> 16:26.770
In fact,
he refuses to even talk.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.240
I suspect that he's
here on your behalf.

16:29.310 --> 16:30.740
Actually, he's there for you,

16:30.810 --> 16:32.910
to help you make sure
nothing happens to my money.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.080
Yeah, but that's--
that's--

16:34.110 --> 16:35.340
that's
really not necessary.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.810
I'll see you in the morning

16:36.880 --> 16:38.150
after my case is dropped,

16:38.210 --> 16:40.480
when I come
to get what's mine.

16:42.090 --> 16:43.520
Whew. That's better.

16:43.590 --> 16:46.090
Good to get out
of those church clothes.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.090
I tried cleaning this up,

16:48.120 --> 16:51.530
but he about bit my head off.

16:51.590 --> 16:53.260
That's what marriage
is, mostly--

16:53.330 --> 16:55.100
putting up with
each other's shit.

16:58.430 --> 16:59.800
You expecting anyone?

16:59.870 --> 17:01.570
I am.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.440
- I'm sorry to interrupt--
- Hi.

17:06.510 --> 17:09.210
...but, uh, this gentleman
says he's here to see you.

17:10.210 --> 17:11.950
Ah. Dr. Barrett.

17:12.010 --> 17:13.579
You met my grandson?

17:13.650 --> 17:14.650
Just now.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.920
Yeah, if you need me,

17:15.980 --> 17:17.119
- I'll be in my room.
- Thank you, Pete.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.319
Lance Lord.

17:19.390 --> 17:20.960
I believe these are yours.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.130
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.260
Hi. How are you?

17:23.329 --> 17:24.530
Thank you for doing
this on a Sunday.

17:24.589 --> 17:25.859
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.160
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.

17:27.230 --> 17:28.630
To be honest,
I'm a little fuzzy

17:28.700 --> 17:30.400
on what this is
we're doing.

17:30.470 --> 17:34.240
Uh, Dr. Barrett's made
an offer on the farm.

17:35.770 --> 17:36.810
An offer to buy it.

17:36.870 --> 17:37.970
I've accepted.

17:38.040 --> 17:41.580
I just need you
to review these terms.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.380
I represent supplies

17:47.450 --> 17:48.780
in the farm-to-table business.

17:48.850 --> 17:52.690
We buy non-working farms
and get them working again.

17:55.490 --> 17:58.160
Okay. Um...

17:58.230 --> 18:00.360
Dr. Barrett, if you
can give us a moment,

18:00.430 --> 18:02.270
I need to confer
with my client.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.900
- Lance--
- It's just a quick chat.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.170
If you don't mind.

18:05.230 --> 18:06.740
It's, uh, it's okay.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.170
Of course.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.810
Uh, take all
the time you need.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.780
I'll be, uh, outside.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.420
Does Otto know about this?

18:20.480 --> 18:22.390
The deed's in my name.

18:22.450 --> 18:25.620
After the stroke,
we transferred it all to me.

18:25.690 --> 18:28.190
Audrey,
this sale's a mistake.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.430
The market's
shit right now.

18:29.490 --> 18:30.690
It's better to ride it out.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.090
I need the money now.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.100
- Because of the investment.
- Yes.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.800
I need everything
I gave to Victoria,

18:36.870 --> 18:38.200
and I can't tell you why.

18:38.270 --> 18:39.470
Well, I'm your attorney.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.340
I'm exactly
who you do tell.

18:48.410 --> 18:50.280
What if I loan you
the money?

18:52.320 --> 18:54.650
- In cash?
- Yeah.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.880
Now?

18:57.990 --> 18:59.390
How could you possibly--

18:59.460 --> 19:00.920
A while back,
I put some money

19:00.990 --> 19:02.230
into a dance club
in Hartford.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.290
A couple days ago,

19:03.360 --> 19:04.890
the other investors
bought me out

19:04.960 --> 19:06.300
in cash.

19:08.030 --> 19:09.670
Uh...

19:12.270 --> 19:14.370
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
This is Audrey.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.070
Tell him it's Otto.
You need privacy.

19:16.140 --> 19:19.980
Oh, Hi, hon. Uh,
could you hold on a sec?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.510
Um, it's Otto.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.380
Would you mind
stepping out a moment

19:25.450 --> 19:27.720
while I lie to my husband?

19:30.450 --> 19:32.560
Thank you, Lance.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.440
Porter said Lance
pulled you into a sidebar.

19:49.510 --> 19:50.940
Is everything okay?

19:51.010 --> 19:53.710
Pete, it's over. We won.

19:53.780 --> 19:55.940
Wait. W-What does--
What does that mean?

19:56.010 --> 19:57.950
Lance offered me the cash.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.950
Oh.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.150
Great.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.360
You bet your ass it's great.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.060
Our con was so good,

20:08.120 --> 20:09.390
we got paid in phase 1.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.960
Not bad for first timers.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.630
Uh, yeah. We're naturals.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.430
I mean, technically,
Lance won,

20:18.500 --> 20:19.740
but-- but the important thing

20:19.800 --> 20:21.140
is that you got
the money back,

20:21.200 --> 20:22.370
so that's good.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.940
Hold on. Hold on. W--

20:24.010 --> 20:25.970
What do you mean,
Lance won?

20:26.040 --> 20:27.980
It's called a Jesus con.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.650
We never talked
about this?

20:29.710 --> 20:31.850
A guy lights
your house on fire,

20:31.910 --> 20:34.150
and then he shows up
in the nick of time

20:34.220 --> 20:35.280
to put it out,

20:35.350 --> 20:37.450
making himself your savior.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.960
A con man's not
always after money.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.500
Julia will think
he's the hero.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.470
She'll never believe my side.

20:50.530 --> 20:53.940
But the important thing
is you got the money, so--

20:54.000 --> 20:55.270
What if I turn it down?

20:55.340 --> 20:57.070
Why would you turn it down?

20:57.140 --> 20:58.440
If I do...

20:59.340 --> 21:00.710
can we still con him?

21:00.780 --> 21:03.010
Grandma, let's just think
about this for a second.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.350
- A bird in the hand
is worth--
- No.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.390
He doesn't get to win.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.360
Farm-to-table, huh?

21:22.470 --> 21:25.370
- Hey.
- How's it going?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.270
Oh, it's okay. What's up?

21:27.370 --> 21:31.010
Your parents want
to hang on to the kids
a little longer.

21:31.070 --> 21:33.140
I told you, you have to
beat them off with a stick.

21:33.210 --> 21:37.850
So I'm thinking
an afternoon without
the flesh anchors.

21:37.910 --> 21:39.620
Let's do a little
day drinking.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.820
I could certainly use one.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.890
Everything okay?

21:43.950 --> 21:45.090
Oh, fine.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.720
How about that place
down by the marina?

21:48.790 --> 21:50.230
Sunday's
all day Happy Hour.

21:50.290 --> 21:52.960
I love it. Uh,
I need to finish up here.

21:53.030 --> 21:54.160
Give me an hour?

21:54.230 --> 21:55.560
I may have to start
without you.

21:55.630 --> 21:57.530
It's one of the reasons
why I love you.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.070
Okay, I'll see you soon.

22:02.140 --> 22:03.070
Okay.

22:05.870 --> 22:07.410
Gentlemen.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.950
Dr. Barrett, I'm ready
to sign the papers.

22:14.780 --> 22:19.560
You have been a terrible
drinking buddy.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.560
Why?

22:20.620 --> 22:21.760
You've barely
said two words

22:21.820 --> 22:23.690
since you got here.
You're so quiet.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.230
I'm sorry.

22:25.290 --> 22:27.900
What was that,
uh, legal stuff

22:27.960 --> 22:30.130
that Audrey wanted to talk
to you about this morning?

22:32.540 --> 22:34.840
Nothing.
Just estate planning.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.640
Hey, listen, uh,
there's no reason

22:41.710 --> 22:43.710
we should both be here
waiting for the check.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.550
Why don't you
go get the kids?

22:45.610 --> 22:47.780
And I'll see you
back at the place.

22:47.850 --> 22:49.490
Sure.

23:01.730 --> 23:02.870
Cheers.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.130
Hey, guys.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.540
So what are we
celebrating?

23:12.610 --> 23:15.140
You guys being perfect
strangers this morning

23:15.210 --> 23:16.980
and now fast friends?

23:17.050 --> 23:19.480
How are you planning
on robbing Audrey?

23:19.550 --> 23:20.980
- No, no--
- No, no, no, no, Lance.

23:21.050 --> 23:22.250
You got it all wrong.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.090
There's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

23:24.150 --> 23:26.860
Okay, then,
Cousin Pete, explain.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.490
Let's hear a perfectly
reasonable explanation

23:29.530 --> 23:31.130
for how you came
to be sitting here

23:31.190 --> 23:32.390
celebrating with the man

23:32.500 --> 23:33.760
who just bought your
grandmother's farm

23:33.830 --> 23:36.000
for a price that would
be insultingly low

23:36.060 --> 23:38.630
if the place were
currently on fire.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.400
- Get you anything?
- I'm good.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.640
Okay.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.540
Come on, fellas.
You're caught.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.110
You can waste time
trying to deny it,

23:49.180 --> 23:51.780
or we start to talk about
what it's going to take

23:51.850 --> 23:54.050
to get me
not to turn you in.

24:04.130 --> 24:05.530
Gentlemen.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.010
Two years ago...

24:19.440 --> 24:21.680
I was going through
security at Sea-Tac,

24:21.740 --> 24:25.280
and, uh, all of a sudden--
this is long story sounding--

24:25.350 --> 24:26.880
TSA goes ape shit.

24:26.950 --> 24:31.420
The, uh, airport cops
are hauling ass towards us.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.860
It takes me a few seconds

24:32.920 --> 24:36.420
to realize that they're
looking at me.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.590
One of the airport's
radiation detectors

24:38.660 --> 24:40.160
thought I was carrying
a dirty bomb.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.160
Were you?

24:44.630 --> 24:46.640
I was carrying this.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.240
I found it on the farm
when I was a kid,

24:52.310 --> 24:53.440
right by the pond.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.140
I was out there,

24:55.210 --> 24:57.110
uh, skipping rocks
one day,

24:57.180 --> 24:58.250
and then I look down.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.620
There's a beautiful
black stone,

24:59.680 --> 25:01.150
so I take it home.

25:01.220 --> 25:05.220
A few months later,
my mother shakes me awake

25:05.290 --> 25:06.590
in the middle of the night.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.920
She says,
"You've got five minutes

25:07.990 --> 25:09.960
to grab anything you ever
want to see again."

25:10.030 --> 25:12.730
At the time,
I thought to myself

25:12.800 --> 25:16.730
this is the moment where my
life changes for the worse.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.500
So one of the things
I grabbed on my way out

25:19.600 --> 25:20.900
is this little stone.

25:20.970 --> 25:22.610
Look, Pete, this is
a touching story.

25:22.610 --> 25:24.610
Are you going to
tell me what this is?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.140
Uraninite.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.640
As in uranium.

25:28.710 --> 25:31.110
Oh, uranium.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.650
In Connecticut?

25:32.720 --> 25:34.680
We're one of the few
states that's got it.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.850
After I analyzed
Pete's stone,

25:36.920 --> 25:38.950
I had him take me
out to the pond.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.720
- Took some core samples.
- How much is down there?

25:40.790 --> 25:42.020
It doesn't matter.

25:42.090 --> 25:43.730
Just from the surface
readings alone,

25:43.790 --> 25:46.360
it promises that some
big energy company

25:46.430 --> 25:47.530
will come in and buy us out.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.200
Okay.
And how much do I get

25:50.270 --> 25:51.300
for not telling Audrey?

25:58.670 --> 26:00.310
We can give you 2.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.780
2 what?

26:03.010 --> 26:04.650
2 million.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.480
How much are you getting?

26:09.550 --> 26:10.720
We're getting our share.

26:10.790 --> 26:13.690
Your share is $2 million.

26:19.330 --> 26:20.930
Can I get a Maker's, neat?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.150
It's not easy
to trust a man

26:39.210 --> 26:41.050
who's ready to fuck over
his own grandmother.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.750
The kind of money
we're talking about,

26:42.820 --> 26:44.420
I'd fuck over
somebody I like.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.690
Yeah, I get it.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.890
And I got to hand it to you.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.360
It almost worked.

26:50.430 --> 26:53.860
Your plan has two fatal flaws.

26:53.930 --> 26:56.930
One is my client
Chayton Dockery.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.030
Audrey took his
cash collateral.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.040
And when he comes
for it tomorrow,

27:01.100 --> 27:03.070
let's just say,
if she's lucky,

27:03.140 --> 27:04.170
she goes to prison

27:04.240 --> 27:05.840
and all of her assets
will be seized

27:05.910 --> 27:07.940
and the sale of the house
will be cancelled.

27:09.510 --> 27:10.710
And if she isn't lucky?

27:10.710 --> 27:12.720
Well, then she's dead,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.420
and you'll be dealing
with Dockery.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.720
Now, if I were
to get the money

27:17.750 --> 27:19.320
and put it in the safe,

27:19.390 --> 27:20.590
everything will be fine

27:20.720 --> 27:22.990
when Audrey opens it
up for Dockery tomorrow.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.390
And why would you do that?

27:25.460 --> 27:27.430
Out of the goodness
of my heart

27:27.500 --> 27:31.300
and $5 million.

27:31.370 --> 27:32.900
There's no fucking way

27:32.970 --> 27:35.570
we're giving you $5 million.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.140
I'd reconsider that.

27:38.210 --> 27:40.740
If you work with me,
you're still rich.

27:40.740 --> 27:43.480
If you go against me,

27:43.550 --> 27:45.150
you get nothing.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.280
I--

27:52.490 --> 27:53.290
Fine.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.560
Fine.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.760
But the money goes
in the safe tonight.

27:57.830 --> 27:59.260
Which brings us
to problem number 2.

27:59.330 --> 28:01.500
If we pay off Dockery,
Audrey's got no reason

28:01.560 --> 28:03.430
to follow through with
the sale of the house.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.770
She sold it to him.

28:04.830 --> 28:06.270
Seeing as it's Sunday,

28:06.330 --> 28:08.140
what you signed
was an intent to sell.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.770
Tomorrow she could put
a stop to all this

28:10.840 --> 28:12.510
and my guess is she will

28:12.570 --> 28:14.540
because that's
what she does.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.310
Audrey's been pawning
collateral.

28:16.380 --> 28:17.980
I have a list
of the items she's sold.

28:18.050 --> 28:20.880
I will threaten
to go to the cops.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.520
She'll lose her license,
her business,

28:23.590 --> 28:24.690
maybe does some time.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.790
Or she signs the farm
over to me.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.320
If Audrey signs the farm
over to you,

28:28.390 --> 28:30.790
the other grandchildren will
all have grounds for suit

28:30.830 --> 28:32.690
once the value of
the land is discovered.

28:32.800 --> 28:33.930
We'll fight them.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.530
And you'd be tied up
in legal battles

28:35.600 --> 28:36.900
for years.

28:39.530 --> 28:41.170
Legally,

28:41.240 --> 28:43.240
the better play would be
to sign the quick claim

28:43.310 --> 28:45.540
over to the only
surviving child.

28:45.610 --> 28:47.440
- What?
- Your mother.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.710
Maybe we can make
a deal with her.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.280
Although shit, no.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.150
Julia told me

28:55.220 --> 28:56.850
she's somewhere
on the West Coast.

29:00.620 --> 29:03.030
No. She's not.

29:03.090 --> 29:06.630
She's here in Bridgeport.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.160
She came back
a few years ago.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.500
She's just never
contacted anybody.

29:10.570 --> 29:11.830
I think she's just waiting

29:11.870 --> 29:15.340
for Otto and Audrey
to-- to die.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.300
Well, call her up.

29:16.370 --> 29:19.040
I-- She doesn't
have a phone. I...

29:19.110 --> 29:20.880
If it's a long story,
then let's go see her.

29:20.940 --> 29:21.940
I don't know where she is.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.710
I have to look for her,
okay?

29:24.850 --> 29:25.950
Okay.

29:28.020 --> 29:31.950
Call me when you've
found her.

29:35.490 --> 29:36.520
Cheers for the drink.

29:39.330 --> 29:41.230
That went well.

29:41.300 --> 29:44.630
We didn't have time
to prep for a rollover.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.870
What did you always tell me?

29:45.870 --> 29:47.270
Work the problem.

29:47.340 --> 29:50.040
You say that like there's
only one problem.

29:50.110 --> 29:53.410
God knows what Lance
is going to come up with

29:53.480 --> 29:56.410
while you try to produce
a mother out of thin air.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.090
Pay the bill.

30:08.290 --> 30:10.460
Hey, uh, I hope you're
having a great Sunday

30:10.530 --> 30:12.060
because we got a big
fucking problem.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.400
Okay.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.130
How soon can you
make it to Bridgeport?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.160
Why?

30:16.230 --> 30:18.070
Because I need you
to be the rope.

30:18.130 --> 30:19.570
Okay.
Who am I playing?

30:19.630 --> 30:20.870
Pete's mom Maggie.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.640
Uh, isn't she,
like, north of 50?

30:22.700 --> 30:25.110
I just played your mistress
a few years ago, Marius.

30:25.170 --> 30:26.510
What, now I'm your mother?

30:26.570 --> 30:27.880
What is this, Hollywood?

30:27.940 --> 30:29.410
Well, we're screwed
if you don't.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.880
Ohh. Do you have any
idea of her height?

30:31.950 --> 30:32.920
No.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.820
Oh. Good. I'll sit.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.480
Uh, need to be dark,

30:36.550 --> 30:37.820
and I'll need something

30:37.890 --> 30:39.750
that makes them not want
to look too closely.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.120
- Okay.
- I need to know a few
things about her, please.

30:42.190 --> 30:44.160
I don't know
much beyond her name.

30:44.230 --> 30:46.530
Well, figure it out.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.750
Shit.

31:37.810 --> 31:38.880
Yeah.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.280
I followed him into New Haven.

31:40.350 --> 31:41.420
He just parks

31:41.480 --> 31:43.050
and into the scientific
supplies store.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.120
What?

31:45.190 --> 31:46.990
Open the car.
Open the car.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.120
- Shit.
- What?

31:48.190 --> 31:49.820
He's buying
a Geiger counter.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.560
God damn.

31:51.630 --> 31:54.000
Look, I need you to stall him
for an hour, all right?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.200
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

31:55.260 --> 31:56.530
I don't know. Look,

31:56.600 --> 31:58.000
you want to succeed
in the life?

31:58.070 --> 32:00.400
Figure it out.
Work the problem.

32:00.470 --> 32:01.600
And now what?

32:01.670 --> 32:02.800
What are we gonna do?

32:02.870 --> 32:04.610
We're gonna salt it.

32:04.670 --> 32:05.840
With what?

32:05.910 --> 32:07.340
Gonna find somebody
on CraigsList

32:07.410 --> 32:09.280
trying to unload a couple
pounds of yellowcake?

32:10.380 --> 32:11.450
Nope.

32:13.350 --> 32:14.080
Bullshit.

32:14.150 --> 32:16.350
Is the internet ever wrong?

32:28.430 --> 32:30.800
If kitty litter's
radioactive enough

32:30.870 --> 32:32.400
to set off a Geiger counter,

32:32.470 --> 32:34.040
what makes you think
it won't grow me

32:34.070 --> 32:35.570
a third nut
or some shit like that?

32:35.640 --> 32:38.040
For the amount you've been
breaking my balls lately,

32:38.110 --> 32:40.040
I could use a spare one.

32:52.820 --> 32:54.060
Hey.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.190
You okay?

32:56.260 --> 32:57.060
No!

32:57.090 --> 32:59.660
Oh, God. Ohh.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.400
Oh, yeah.

33:04.070 --> 33:05.270
No.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.070
My boyfriend.

33:10.070 --> 33:12.310
He hurt you?

33:14.510 --> 33:18.310
Uh, you want me
to call the cops?

33:18.380 --> 33:20.150
No. No.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.420
That'll only
make things worse.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.790
I just want to go
to his place,

33:25.850 --> 33:28.190
pick up my stuff.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.360
If I just had an hour.

33:55.550 --> 33:57.620
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
Otto speaking.

33:57.690 --> 34:00.560
I'm at the bar.
Come see me now.

34:02.220 --> 34:04.160
Yeah, it, uh...

34:04.230 --> 34:08.429
Well, no, no, no,
sir, we don't,

34:08.500 --> 34:10.699
and, um, I would--
I would appreciate it

34:10.770 --> 34:13.239
if you would take us
off your list.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.850
Hey, uh, you mind watching
the place for a few minutes

34:25.909 --> 34:27.620
while I go hit the head?

34:27.679 --> 34:28.920
You don't have a toilet?

34:28.980 --> 34:30.550
Oh, it's busted.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.260
Goddamn landlord doesn't
want to pay to fix it.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.860
We've been using
the bar down the street.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.260
Anyone stops in,
just tell them
I'll be back in five

34:37.330 --> 34:40.560
or thereabouts.
At my age, it may
take a little longer.

34:56.409 --> 34:57.350
Hey.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.880
Hey, why'd you
park me in?

35:03.420 --> 35:04.990
Hey, what the fuck,
man?

35:05.050 --> 35:06.520
Why'd you park me in?

35:11.990 --> 35:13.630
You want to take a swing?

35:13.700 --> 35:15.200
Do it.

35:15.260 --> 35:16.800
Nothing
would make me happier.

35:16.860 --> 35:18.700
Just want you
to move your truck.

35:18.770 --> 35:20.300
What was I thinking?

35:20.370 --> 35:21.840
You only beat women,
right?

35:36.650 --> 35:37.520
Listen--

35:37.590 --> 35:39.050
You're not paying
for a double,

35:39.120 --> 35:41.220
and even if you--
even if you were,

35:41.260 --> 35:43.230
it wouldn't include
Crazy Horse over there.

35:43.260 --> 35:44.890
That's a whole other
deal entirely.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.330
- I'm trying--
- You're not
trying hard enough.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.930
Get rid of him soon,
or this doesn't happen.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.710
He left New Haven
an hour ago.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.480
He'll be here.

36:03.550 --> 36:05.150
Yeah, well,
I'm just saying.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.810
No, you're
just worrying.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.850
Hmm.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.150
Where else is he
going to go

36:09.250 --> 36:10.920
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.

36:14.860 --> 36:15.760
Hi, Julia.

36:15.820 --> 36:16.960
I did what you asked.

36:17.020 --> 36:18.290
I got him to the restaurant

36:18.360 --> 36:19.930
and made sure he was
facing the door.

36:19.990 --> 36:24.270
Thank you. Look, I know
how tough this is for you.

36:24.270 --> 36:26.370
Tough? This is--
This is tough?

36:26.430 --> 36:28.900
No matter how this
goes down, I lose.

36:28.970 --> 36:30.140
You get that, don't you?

36:30.270 --> 36:31.810
If you're right,

36:31.870 --> 36:32.870
the father of my son

36:32.940 --> 36:35.280
is nothing better
than a con man.

36:35.310 --> 36:36.880
If you're wrong...

36:38.010 --> 36:39.580
I betrayed him.

36:39.650 --> 36:40.950
I-- I understand it.
I--

36:48.090 --> 36:49.320
Any action?

36:53.930 --> 36:54.960
Well...

36:59.070 --> 37:01.540
Huh. You have no idea.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.710
when I was a young man,

37:03.770 --> 37:06.770
I used to piss,
it was like a river.

37:08.980 --> 37:09.910
Coffee?

37:14.120 --> 37:14.980
There you go.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.750
It's on the house.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.520
What?

37:57.890 --> 37:59.360
Oh, good.

37:59.430 --> 38:02.430
Well, I certainly look
forward to meeting her.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.530
Hi.

38:44.070 --> 38:45.210
Oh!

38:50.750 --> 38:52.510
What the fuck do you want?

38:56.950 --> 38:58.890
Don't fucking talk
to me like that.

38:58.950 --> 38:59.990
Fuck!

39:00.050 --> 39:02.420
You know what? You just
leave the fucking bar.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.060
I'm j-- Which one?

39:04.130 --> 39:05.090
Fuck you.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.160
Yeah, fuck you.

39:06.230 --> 39:07.960
F--

39:08.030 --> 39:09.860
Unbelievable, man.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.830
- She's fucking impossible.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:11.900 --> 39:12.900
What happened?

39:12.970 --> 39:14.100
She's worse than Audrey.

39:14.170 --> 39:16.000
Or maybe it's you.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.520
Can I buy you a drink?

39:41.330 --> 39:42.560
Uh, are you
supposed to smoke

39:42.630 --> 39:45.170
around pressurized
oxygen?

39:45.230 --> 39:46.670
No.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.470
That's
why I turned it off.

39:50.510 --> 39:51.910
Dip shit.

40:06.420 --> 40:07.660
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.590
That was the wrong way
to start this.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.290
- Gee.
- Maggie, my name is Lance.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.800
I'm, uh...

40:14.860 --> 40:17.300
in a relationship
with your niece.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.000
I know your mother
very well.

40:19.070 --> 40:21.100
I've been on the wrong
end of her wrath

40:21.170 --> 40:22.600
a good many times.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.670
- And, uh--
- Up-up-up.

40:28.310 --> 40:29.280
Shit.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.550
Shit! Fuck!

40:43.290 --> 40:44.560
She lose the lisp?

40:44.630 --> 40:45.790
Pardon me?

40:47.130 --> 40:48.560
Julia.

40:48.630 --> 40:50.600
Had a bad lisp as a kid.

40:50.670 --> 40:52.830
I only rooted for her.

40:52.900 --> 40:53.840
Yeah.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.900
She told me about that.

40:56.970 --> 40:59.670
That must have been
cute as hell.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.380
But yeah,
she lost the lisp.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.710
She grew into a beautiful,
smart woman.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.450
Look, I know

41:07.550 --> 41:09.720
what Audrey did to you.

41:09.780 --> 41:11.650
And as far as I can see,

41:11.720 --> 41:14.220
right now, this is your
chance to get back at her.

41:23.570 --> 41:26.670
Ahem. Didn't you say you were
gonna buy me a drink?

41:30.140 --> 41:32.770
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.080
You got to pay her tab.

41:35.140 --> 41:36.580
Pay the tab.

41:36.610 --> 41:38.650
Son of a bitch.

41:38.710 --> 41:40.920
All right, so when
we get the money

41:40.980 --> 41:42.850
and I put it in the safe,
I'll let you call Audrey,

41:42.920 --> 41:45.290
- and you can be the hero.
- Yeah, absolutely not.

41:45.350 --> 41:46.650
You're
not coming with me,

41:46.720 --> 41:48.920
and I'm not giving
you the money.

41:48.990 --> 41:51.030
Hey. Hey.

41:52.890 --> 41:54.900
I'm the only one with
the combination to the safe.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.930
And I give a shit because?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.270
I don't trust you, Pete,
so I'll get the money,

42:01.340 --> 42:03.910
and I'll see you there
at 8 p.m.

42:03.970 --> 42:05.910
And don't get
any brilliant ideas

42:05.970 --> 42:07.640
about following me,
either.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.750
Come on.

42:56.060 --> 42:57.760
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

42:57.830 --> 43:00.090
You make one more sound,
I swear to Christ

43:00.160 --> 43:02.730
I'll bury this in your
fucking Adam's apple.

43:07.940 --> 43:09.940
I'm here to cut you loose.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.220
Now this gag.
Don't test me.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.100
Uhh!

43:57.790 --> 43:59.750
Moved your car around back.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.860
Uh-uh. My gun.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.530
Not going to happen.

44:04.590 --> 44:05.990
Katie's got it,

44:06.060 --> 44:07.730
so if you don't
want to get shot,

44:07.800 --> 44:09.300
don't wake her up.

44:12.770 --> 44:14.140
Detective.

44:15.770 --> 44:17.810
Me and my family
ain't going anywhere.

44:17.870 --> 44:19.840
This is our home.

44:19.910 --> 44:21.910
I see you around here again,

44:21.980 --> 44:23.810
I'm gonna assume the worst,

44:23.880 --> 44:26.010
cop or no cop.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.390
There's nothing I won't do
to protect my family.

44:32.450 --> 44:34.860
Tell me you understand that.

44:36.460 --> 44:38.660
I understand.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.090
I hope so.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.240
We're closed.

44:56.310 --> 44:57.780
You can't be here.

44:57.780 --> 44:59.080
I told you over the phone.

44:59.150 --> 45:00.950
Sean's due back
from Hartford any minute.

45:02.620 --> 45:04.150
Taylor.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.460
I was out
at Reading Road today.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.100
Taylor, I can't.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.470
You know, they woke up
that morning,

45:18.530 --> 45:20.000
just like any other day.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.840
Drank their coffee,
brushed their teeth.

45:23.910 --> 45:27.070
Dropped Carly off
at kindergarten,

45:27.140 --> 45:29.480
never knowing
they were doing it all

45:29.540 --> 45:30.950
for the last time.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.880
You think they thought
of any of that?

45:37.420 --> 45:38.420
That moment when they--

45:38.490 --> 45:40.450
when they saw the pickup
blow the stop sign?

45:43.660 --> 45:46.830
Because I'm--
I'm wondering...

45:46.860 --> 45:49.500
if maybe there's--
there's no such thing

45:49.560 --> 45:51.100
as never knew
what hit them.

45:51.170 --> 45:53.000
Maybe that's just
something you say

45:53.070 --> 45:56.070
on next of kin
notification.

45:56.140 --> 45:57.870
You know?

45:57.940 --> 46:01.240
I'm wondering
if there isn't--

46:01.310 --> 46:03.980
there isn't
always a moment...

46:05.480 --> 46:07.180
when you look back

46:07.250 --> 46:11.550
and you see all the
things that you did...

46:14.020 --> 46:16.360
and all the things
that you didn't do.

46:16.420 --> 46:17.390
Listen, I--

46:18.690 --> 46:20.760
I want to hear this,
I really do, but--

46:20.860 --> 46:23.870
Sean, he's coming
back from Hartford.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.000
A couple of months ago,

46:28.070 --> 46:30.070
the idea
of not being a cop--

46:30.140 --> 46:31.770
Fuck.

46:31.870 --> 46:33.540
Fuck. He's here.

46:33.610 --> 46:35.680
Taylor, you have to go.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.210
You should be with me.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.780
Not Sean.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.450
I should have said it
in high school.

46:42.520 --> 46:45.050
I should have said it
on the day he proposed,

46:45.120 --> 46:47.120
but I'm saying it now.

46:48.490 --> 46:49.790
What the fuck is this?

46:49.890 --> 46:51.560
This, fucko,
is me telling you

46:51.630 --> 46:52.990
what I just finished
telling her.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.030
You keep parking your
fucking monster truck

46:55.100 --> 46:56.700
in front of our place,

46:56.760 --> 46:58.100
I'm going to personally
see to it

46:58.170 --> 47:00.030
that a couple of hoppers
from Marina Village Projects

47:00.100 --> 47:02.300
joy ride it down to one of
the Stratford Ave. cop shops

47:02.370 --> 47:05.040
and turn it into a fucking
art exhibit.

47:07.740 --> 47:10.610
My, Grandma couldn't
handle her own dirty work.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.480
Had to send the cop.

47:12.550 --> 47:15.920
I'll do what I can,
but we get so busy here,

47:15.920 --> 47:17.150
we run out of spots.

47:17.220 --> 47:19.450
It's always so empty
up by your place.

47:21.490 --> 47:23.020
Nobody sent me.

47:25.330 --> 47:27.160
Oh, you just lost your temper?

47:27.230 --> 47:29.200
You flew off the handle?

47:33.230 --> 47:36.600
Well, I heard you've been
doing that a lot lately.

47:38.740 --> 47:40.140
Hey, if you, uh...

47:40.210 --> 47:41.810
if you ever need
to be bailed out,

47:41.940 --> 47:43.540
I hope you give us a call.

47:50.150 --> 47:53.050
How'd it go? Sean.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.620
Hartford.
How-- How did it go?

47:55.690 --> 47:58.560
Good. Yeah. Really good.

47:58.630 --> 47:59.790
The time's coming

47:59.860 --> 48:00.960
when we won't have to worry

48:01.030 --> 48:02.560
about Audrey
poaching business.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.670
Audrey or anyone else.

48:07.970 --> 48:09.270
Good.

48:14.610 --> 48:17.010
How do you-- Are you sure
that's Dockery's guy?

48:17.080 --> 48:18.780
I'm pretty fucking sure.
I defended him one time

48:18.850 --> 48:20.180
after he bit
a guy's nose off.

48:20.250 --> 48:21.680
He's not the kind
of person you forget.

48:21.750 --> 48:22.820
Fuck.

48:22.880 --> 48:24.990
I guess Dockery
got it in his head

48:24.990 --> 48:26.990
someone's trying
to take his money.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.220
Yeah. The guy
must be paranoid.

48:31.690 --> 48:34.260
There's no way I'm going
in until he's gone.

49:31.250 --> 49:33.190
Hey, why don't you
give me the bag?

49:33.250 --> 49:35.090
You can watch me
through the window.

49:36.460 --> 49:39.260
No. I told you we're
doing this together.

50:13.930 --> 50:15.630
Where's that toilet?

50:16.700 --> 50:18.470
Uh...

50:18.530 --> 50:20.100
the bar just down the street.

50:20.170 --> 50:21.500
If they give you a hard time,

50:21.570 --> 50:22.970
just tell them you're with me.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.370
If they give me a hard time?

50:33.350 --> 50:35.620
This might
be our only chance.

50:38.420 --> 50:39.450
Mm-mm.

51:01.710 --> 51:04.280
Hi, Grandpa. Hey, uh,
Julia forgot some papers,

51:04.350 --> 51:06.050
and Lance has something
he wants to talk to you about.

51:06.150 --> 51:07.580
Two seconds.
We'll be out of your hair.

51:07.650 --> 51:10.150
- No, no, Pete--
- I need to call in
a favor, all right?

51:10.180 --> 51:11.750
Because Julia and I
are getting married.

51:11.820 --> 51:12.890
Hey, hey, hey.

51:12.950 --> 51:14.160
Well, we're
actually eloping.

51:14.220 --> 51:15.360
We might be eloping.

51:22.600 --> 51:23.960
I think
you guys are great.

51:24.030 --> 51:25.400
My main thing is I--

51:25.470 --> 51:27.370
I don't want Jacob
to feel less than

51:27.430 --> 51:29.270
in a couple of years
when he realizes

51:29.340 --> 51:30.970
Julia and I
were never married.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.440
I know Julia-- I realize

51:32.510 --> 51:35.010
your granddaughter,
she's a modern woman,

51:35.080 --> 51:36.710
and she's just, you know,

51:36.780 --> 51:38.040
she's a modern woman.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.280
She's "Down
with the patriarchy,"

51:39.350 --> 51:40.550
and I'm all for that.

51:40.610 --> 51:42.320
I just think it would
be easier on the kids

51:42.380 --> 51:45.690
than if we had a ceremony
and started wearing rings.

51:45.750 --> 51:48.190
I'm going to ask Julia
to marry me. All right?

51:48.260 --> 51:49.960
She doesn't really want
to start talking about it.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.190
I'm the only one who starts
talking about it before.

51:52.190 --> 51:53.860
And I'm not
asking you to be--

51:53.930 --> 51:55.200
- Lance--
- ...uh--

51:58.030 --> 52:00.300
Everybody get
on the fucking ground!

52:02.040 --> 52:03.300
Now!
