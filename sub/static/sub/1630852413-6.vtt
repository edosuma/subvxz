WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:09.551
Yes, the magazine interview was my idea.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.304
Lorenza is my friend
and we thought it'd be great

00:13.388 --> 00:15.348
to discuss the business opportunities

00:15.432 --> 00:17.600
that are opening up
for women with children.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.354
That was…

00:23.648 --> 00:24.524
a great idea.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.777
The board is very pleased.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.238
You made the company look good.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.365
And Jorge now looks particularly good

00:32.449 --> 00:34.951
to our female executives worldwide.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.121
Your marriage might be at risk now.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.414
Hey, no.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.792
Ana, we want to give you a promotion.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.294
Oh, really?

00:44.794 --> 00:47.005
As the new development officer

00:47.088 --> 00:48.506
for all Latin America.

00:50.675 --> 00:55.180
I told Matheus we should
give you a few days to think about it.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.601
It's a full-time job
that requires a lot of traveling.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.852
You have your babies, so…

01:00.935 --> 01:02.145
Thank you, Jorge.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.190
But a man can't explain to me

01:05.273 --> 01:07.108
what it's like to be a working mom.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.360
I love this woman!

01:10.153 --> 01:11.946
But I wouldn't mind

01:12.030 --> 01:15.075
taking a few days
or even a week to think about it.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.371
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:23.476 --> 02:24.394
Hello, darling.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.021
Wow!

02:27.522 --> 02:29.899
How come
you're home early giving kisses away?

02:31.192 --> 02:33.236
I'm taking the week off.

02:35.071 --> 02:35.989
Really?

02:36.948 --> 02:38.449
-That's great!
-I know, right?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.535
I'll do the same to be with you.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.954
-Great.
-But why?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.166
Because they offered

02:46.249 --> 02:48.459
and I deserve it, don't I?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.211
Of course you do.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.844
Hey, Mom.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.305
Look. The salon's furniture just arrived,

03:00.388 --> 03:02.390
and Lorena can't help me unpack.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.475
But look how pretty the chairs are.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.644
-Yes, they are.
-Swipe right, there's more.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.146
Check them out.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.859
-Anuar, what a surprise.
-Hello, Tere.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.320
You dropped this.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.321
Thank you.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.698
I was at his place.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.159
I wanted him to meet Regina.
So, he gave me a ride.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.202
What's that?

03:22.285 --> 03:26.289
Pictures of some chairs
that just came in for my mom's salon.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.708
I didn't know you had a salon.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.211
I didn't know I had to tell you.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.837
Well, she just opened it.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.547
These are nice chairs.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.716
They must've cost you a fortune.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.842
Not really.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.844
Never spend your seed money

03:39.928 --> 03:42.347
on luxury furniture
if you're just starting.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.725
The business revenue
must exceed its expenses.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.894
Always. First rule of business management.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.273
And I suggest
you get a card reader to charge.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.608
They're quite efficient.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.194
I already have one. Thanks.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.614
I could be your adviser,
for it to actually work this time.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.450
What could be better than someone

04:02.533 --> 04:05.578
pointing out my every mistake
and calling for disaster?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.330
-Teresa--
-Don't "Teresa" me!

04:07.872 --> 04:09.999
He always does this,
he always puts me down.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.586
I'm just trying to help you
so you don't fail again.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.297
Hey, calm down.
There's no need to get all--

04:16.381 --> 04:17.507
There's every need!

04:18.424 --> 04:19.968
I don't need you.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.637
You may leave now.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.975
Fine. It's okay, Mariana. Excuse me.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.230
What? He started it.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.149
Time flies.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.111
So, we need to book everything right away.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.738
The party could be 
Cirque du Soleil-themed.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.156
Oh yeah, I love it!

04:43.324 --> 04:44.742
How are the preparations going?

04:45.910 --> 04:46.869
Awesome.

04:46.953 --> 04:47.912
Really?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.956
So, you have a guest artist?

04:50.039 --> 04:51.833
Last year it was Reik.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.378
It's not totally confirmed yet,

04:56.087 --> 04:58.923
but we're about
to close a deal with Mario Bautista.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.554
Like you could ever
get someone like Mario.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.348
-Think what you want, Estela.
-I do.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.312
Hello, Mom. I need your advice.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.397
I was offered a promotion.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.608
Congratulations?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.071
What is it, sweetie?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.282
When my dad left you,

05:24.866 --> 05:26.034
how was it?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.201
Juan Carlos left you?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.329
-No.
-Let me guess.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.748
He slept with his secretary.
Same old story.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.875
They look for someone inferior to them.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.960
No, Mom. It's not his secretary…

05:36.044 --> 05:37.670
You know what? Forget it.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.214
-I have to go.
-Ana, wait.

05:40.298 --> 05:44.093
Whatever is going on
with Juan Carlos, take the promotion.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.055
Don't let any man tell you what to do.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.475
All right.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.101
Thanks, Mom. Bye.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.818
-Dude, check this out.
-What?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.988
Want to come to my birthday party

06:04.072 --> 06:06.657
and meet me in person?
Join the Good Vibes Challenge.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.910
It's that easy. All you have to do

06:08.993 --> 06:11.120
is spread the good vibes.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
If you're the best, I'll see you here.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.166
See you soon.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.419
No. No way!

06:18.503 --> 06:21.672
I won't make a fool of myself,
not even to meet Mario Bautista.

06:23.091 --> 06:23.925
But…

06:24.634 --> 06:25.927
I have an idea.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.971
I'll ask my Mom to get him for us.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.348
Can she?

06:30.431 --> 06:33.601
Dude, she's so competitive.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.478
She'll take on any challenge.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.778
Good morning.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.032
I hadn't slept for so long in ages.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.494
You only slept eight hours,
like normal people do.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.540
This is the best part of mornings at home.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.795
And a great way to start the day.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.842
I think it's time
you start taking care of yourself.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.011
-You're 22 already.
-I'm an app developer and a mom.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.179
So?

07:10.263 --> 07:13.474
That doesn't mean
you can't dress up, go out,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.768
and maybe think about getting laid.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.147
Yep, nothing ever stops me 
from thinking about sex.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.940
-For real?
-Rodrigo.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.235
-Good morning.
-Morning.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.821
Mom, what are you doing home so late?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.073
I'm taking a few days off.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.909
-Wow.
-I said the same thing, Rodri.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.913
Come on, guys. It's only been ten…

07:35.997 --> 07:37.373
-Twelve?
-Thirteen.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.583
Well, whatever.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.294
-I haven't taken a break in ages.
-That many?

07:41.377 --> 07:44.255
Well, no matter how long,
I'm glad you chose this week

07:44.338 --> 07:46.924
because I need you
to help me with something huge.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.094
Nothing's impossible.
What do you need, sweetie?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.388
To get Mario Bautista for my prom.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.347
For real?

07:53.931 --> 07:55.308
Leave her alone,

07:55.391 --> 07:57.768
being in charge of prom is no easy task.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.730
I'll get you Marco Bautista, sweetie.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.023
Mario Bautista.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.317
Do you have an ice-sculpture guy?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.401
What for?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.528
For the centerpieces.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.198
What?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.824
Sorry to interrupt, honey.

08:12.825 --> 08:17.330
I booked a couple's baking lesson
for this afternoon. Wanna go?

08:17.413 --> 08:18.456
Oh, how fun!

08:20.041 --> 08:22.752
But I want to help Ceci
with this Miguel Bautista guy.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.004
It's Mario, Mom. But it's okay.

08:25.087 --> 08:29.300
Go to the baking lesson
and I'll handle the prom thing.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.384
Really?

08:31.761 --> 08:32.637
So, we're going?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.598
We are. As you wish, honey.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.560
Hey, don't flaunt
in front of the spinster.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.187
What spinster?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.773
Mariana.
Can't you see she's sad and alone?

08:43.856 --> 08:47.360
-I'm fine.
-I'm calling to confirm our attendance.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.613
-This one?
-No.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.741
-This one?
-No.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.952
This one?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.662
No, they're all bad.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.248
It's for a dating app, not for a passport.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.457
Can I have them?

09:01.541 --> 09:02.875
Of course not.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.253
-What about this one?
-Yes.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.129
This one's way better.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.549
So you don't look suspicious.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.926
Well, it's not like
she has anything to hide.

09:14.095 --> 09:18.015
Hey, are you looking
for men, women, or both?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.141
Oh, I don't know.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.311
I don't know
which are more complicated anymore.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.107
Well, if I were you,
I'd play double the odds.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.067
You know what?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.610
You're right.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.989
-Here goes nothing.
-Yeah.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.118
Should I say I'm a mom?

09:37.201 --> 09:38.953
No. No, of course not.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.871
You don't want to scare them off.

09:40.955 --> 09:41.831
Okay.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.459
I did it!

09:50.798 --> 09:52.550
PALOMA

09:53.259 --> 09:54.302
Who is Paloma?

09:55.136 --> 09:56.012
No one.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.557
How do I look?

10:02.226 --> 10:03.185
Very handsome.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.109
Elements are formed
by their atomic number,

10:10.985 --> 10:12.653
equal to their number of protons.

10:13.154 --> 10:13.988
Got it?

10:15.031 --> 10:15.865
Sure.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.702
By their electron configuration
and chemical properties too.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.125
This is really hard.
Why don't you write it down and I read it?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.838
Yeah, Mario Bautista.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.298
How much flour?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.718
Well, please get it done, Cynthia. Bye.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.138
I don't know, I didn't pay attention.
How much did she say?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.681
-Hello.
-Look here…

10:40.765 --> 10:42.808
-Can you take a picture of us?
-Of course.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.727
Thanks.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.148
-One more.
-Yeah.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.652
Don't be silly.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.613
-Wait.
-Just one more.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.116
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.369
I'm Pía and this is my husband, Alonso.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.704
-Ana. Nice to meet you.
-Hi. Juan Carlos.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.705
-Alonso.
-Hi.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.293
By the way, don't use that bowl.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.087
Use that one instead

11:11.170 --> 11:13.297
and smear a bit of oil on it.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.050
That'll keep the souffle
from sticking to the dish.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.511
-Yes.
-Thank you.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.512
You're welcome.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.935
How do I get Paloma to like me?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.980
Scientific studies have proved

11:30.064 --> 11:32.566
that a fundamental part of seduction

11:32.650 --> 11:35.444
is about sending signals
to your crush's subconscious.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.196
You have to get into her head.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.116
-Get it?
-Sure.

11:40.950 --> 11:41.784
Follow me.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.327
What is this?

11:45.746 --> 11:46.831
Take notes.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.334
Ceci…

11:51.335 --> 11:52.420
how old are you?

11:53.629 --> 11:54.547
Seventeen.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.260
Ceci,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.387
what's your favorite color?

12:01.470 --> 12:02.388
Purple.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.598
Purple. Got that?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.144
Ceci, what grade are you in?

12:08.769 --> 12:10.730
Stop, guys, what are you doing?

12:10.813 --> 12:13.107
Pablo is teaching me how to seduce Paloma.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.150
Oh, that's easy.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.111
Invite her to Vail
or buy her a Louis Vuitton bag.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.030
No, don't listen to her.
She's too young for this.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.200
I'll try this tomorrow with Paloma.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.577
Yes. Attaboy!

12:28.998 --> 12:30.624
Is that supposed to happen?

12:34.253 --> 12:35.171
Let me.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.255
No!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.090
Let me help you.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.718
Stop it!

12:41.635 --> 12:43.012
I bet they're newlyweds.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.514
We were just as corny at first.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.683
-Wait--
-No!

12:48.976 --> 12:51.061
I begged her to come, but she refused.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.148
I don't know what else to do
to make you get along.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.067
Well, your mom and I
never really got along.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.988
I thought you were best friends.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.033
That's what she wanted.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.702
What do you mean?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.622
I was in love with her,

13:09.705 --> 13:12.625
but she never loved me back.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.337
She even went out
on dates while I took care of you.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.173
But that's in the past, right?

13:24.261 --> 13:25.179
What?

13:27.598 --> 13:29.433
Are you still in love with her?

13:34.688 --> 13:37.149
Mariana, please, don't tell her.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.986
I don't want any trouble. Okay? Please.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.447
Okay.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.371
The first time never goes right.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.463
How long have you been married?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.507
The best 20 years of my life.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.676
What's the secret?

14:03.759 --> 14:05.052
Never neglect one another.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.680
Spending as much time together as we can.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.766
If you're doing
something fun, all the better.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.351
-Right.
-Like salsa classes.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.477
-Sure!
-On Wednesdays.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.187
It's amazing. You'll love it.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.482
-No thanks…
-Oh, yes, we'd love it.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.694
Only if you're as charming as today.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.903
Yes.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.196
I love this!

14:24.280 --> 14:25.990
He's still in love with her,

14:26.073 --> 14:27.366
but my mom has no clue.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.287
Love is overrated. I blame Facebook.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.373
So, can you dance salsa?

14:34.456 --> 14:37.251
Yes, come. I'll show you the basics.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.921
Grab my shoulder. I'll grab your waist.

14:41.005 --> 14:46.051
Take a step back
with this leg and I'll step forward.

14:46.135 --> 14:52.808
One, two, three, four.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.186
Is everything okay?

14:56.270 --> 14:58.063
Yeah, well…

14:59.148 --> 15:03.611
Ceci helped me set up
my dating-app profile and…

15:03.694 --> 15:05.529
I just got a match.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.822
Is that a bad thing?

15:07.865 --> 15:11.410
Well, I don't know. I haven't been
with anyone since Regina was born

15:11.493 --> 15:13.579
and I feel my body is not my body anymore.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.457
I know exactly what you mean.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.877
Don't worry,
everything gets back to its place.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.337
Yes, but when?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.256
You have to be patient,
it doesn't happen overnight.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.674
That reminds me…

15:26.342 --> 15:27.259
Look.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.181
This one's great, it tightens you up.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.183
You can have it…

15:35.142 --> 15:36.602
if you promise

15:36.685 --> 15:38.896
you'll never again
say you're not attractive.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.273
I promise.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.692
Thanks.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.570
Enjoy your match.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.577
What is it, Cynthia?

15:53.661 --> 15:58.916
I couldn't get Mario Bautista,
the YouTuber-influencer singer guy.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.585
He's booked for the next two years.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.963
Aren't there any other options?

16:04.046 --> 16:05.255
There's Franco De Vita…

16:06.924 --> 16:08.092
Abeja.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.345
Or the Emmanuel-Mijares combo.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.014
Oh, can't we book Mijares alone?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.935
That would be amazing.
Mijares was at my prom.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.730
Can you check with Ceci so I can book him?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.441
No, go ahead and book him.
We can't risk it.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.486
It'll be a surprise. Thank you.

16:31.073 --> 16:35.244
All I want is for Regina
to have a family, but I don't know how.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.248
You could start
by worrying less about me and Anuar.

16:39.331 --> 16:43.502
That relationship is so old, so ancient,
it has nothing to do with you.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.838
It absolutely does!
I have Anuar's last name.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.466
But so what? It's a common last name.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.136
It's not a fancy name or a trust fund.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.804
Hey, it's more than that.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.892
Love is the best thing to have
and you're taking it for granted.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.395
What makes you say that?

17:02.396 --> 17:04.565
Okay, Anuar asked me not to tell you.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.026
But you're a tattletale.
So, you'll tell me anyway?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.152
-Yes.
-What?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.653
He's still in love with you.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.156
Oh, no!

17:13.282 --> 17:15.284
-Did he really tell you that?
-Yes.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.914
This song reminds me of our prom.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.459
Oh, me too!

17:23.542 --> 17:24.918
It was great.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.003
Now it's Ceci's turn,

17:26.086 --> 17:28.422
she's planning her prom.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.549
I'm getting her Mijares as a gift.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.051
Oh, how nice!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.093
Yes, minus Emmanuel.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.096
What do you mean? What about their duets?

17:36.180 --> 17:39.933
I don't know where she goes
Where she lives and it's all bad

17:40.017 --> 17:41.018
Okay, I get it.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.061
It's always the same

17:42.144 --> 17:43.896
That party was great. Your turn.

17:43.979 --> 17:44.938
It was awesome.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.942
I remember
you ate your feelings that night, Ana.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.987
And you lost your virginity.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.198
Well, it was the '90s.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.866
With my boyfriend.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.329
He said you weren't together anymore.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.122
-Your turn.
-Sorry.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.750
Hurry, girls. I have a salsa class.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.920
You, salsa? But you have two left feet.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.924
This nerd is so lame.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.802
Besides, he keeps touching my shoulder.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.304
But whatever,
he's almost done with my presentation.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.473
No, chemistry.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.768
Another dork, Luis,
is doing my math homework.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.853
Anyway, I have to go. I'm meeting Paco.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.981
I know, he's so cute.
I'm totally kissing him.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.483
All right, bye.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.988
I found a great breastfeeding article

18:35.072 --> 18:36.323
for the app.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.576
Hey, by the way,
we need it to run on Android too.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.161
How is that going so far?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.664
-It's almost done.
-Great.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.920
How's that dating app going for you?

18:50.796 --> 18:51.797
You saw my profile?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.592
No, I don't use those things.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.136
Ceci told me.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.597
I didn't bring it up
because I didn't want to upset you.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.600
No, not at all.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.019
You know what?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.605
You can tell me about it.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.523
I'm all ears.

19:11.066 --> 19:11.984
Okay.

19:12.568 --> 19:16.488
I have a date tonight.
I don't know if I should go.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.867
I feel very insecure right now.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.619
I wish I was like Camila Sodi,

19:22.703 --> 19:24.830
getting hotter with every child.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.001
What's worse, I won't stop milking.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.335
All day, every day.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.461
Can I be honest?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.298
Those boobs are a plus.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.510
Oh, I don't know.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.139
Maybe sex for sex's sake
isn't my thing. You know?

19:42.222 --> 19:46.059
It works fine for me.
It doesn't bother me.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.021
So, you don't think I should cancel?

19:49.104 --> 19:52.649
No way, you should go.
I'll look after Regina.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.610
-Really?
-Yes.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.529
Pablo, I need your help.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.530
What is it?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.992
I'm not letting anyone
take advantage of my brother,

20:02.492 --> 20:03.410
other than me.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.373
You need a new strategy.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.376
Why? I think things are going great.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.296
She even remembered
I lent her a pencil in fifth grade.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.257
It's part of the plan.
It's the next stage.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.176
Okay.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.055
You'll see, you'll love this class.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.848
Can't wait.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.683
Hi, everybody. How are you?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.060
Great!

20:28.143 --> 20:31.813
I have a surprise for you.
Today will be a cha-cha-chá class.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.567
Grab your partners, please.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.697
-But you said it was salsa.
-Whatever, just go with it.

20:45.953 --> 20:46.787
Ready?

20:46.870 --> 20:48.830
Five, six, seven, and…

20:50.457 --> 20:53.126
Cha-cha-chá. That's it, cha-cha-chá.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.586
There you go.

20:55.087 --> 20:55.921
That's it!

20:57.381 --> 21:00.759
But… Look how she does it. Like this.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.638
María Pía,
you're doing a great job. Excellent.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.723
Well done.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.433
Magnificent.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.772
Hey, no, no.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.775
-I mean, you go that way…
-Look at them.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.735
One, two, three…

21:19.486 --> 21:20.988
That's it, great!

21:21.571 --> 21:23.573
See? That's it, well done!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.994
I love your taste in music.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.620
-Please.
-Thank you.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.249
Here's the living room.

21:32.332 --> 21:36.086
You're also very pretty.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.963
Thanks.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.841
I haven't been keeping up
with the latest music.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.219
A beer?

21:44.761 --> 21:46.555
-Yes, sure. Thanks.
-Okay.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.640
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.350
I'll be right back.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.653
Hello.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.490
I'm Marta, Héctor's roomie.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.494
Don't worry about me.
I won't hear you with these.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.499
Two cold beers coming up.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.086
I hope you're thirsty.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.297
-Thank you.
-No problem.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.052
You really don't mind me being a mom?

22:25.135 --> 22:25.969
No.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.765
On the contrary. It's super hot.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.896
Did you know there's an entire
porn genre dedicated to MILFs?

22:37.898 --> 22:38.774
I swear.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.571
You're beautiful.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.791
Sorry. Are you okay?

22:55.874 --> 22:56.833
-Yes.
-Did I hurt you?

22:56.917 --> 23:01.004
No, I'm fine.
I just need to use the bathroom.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.923
-Right now?
-Yes.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.635
-Where is it?
-Down the hall.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.845
Make yourself at home.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.517
When is Mariana
getting back from her date?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.144
Is it weird for you?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.313
No, it's fine.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.358
I'm glad.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.652
It was about time

23:23.735 --> 23:26.071
she found a new love, right?

23:30.784 --> 23:31.618
Well,

23:32.285 --> 23:33.161
good night.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.088
Where do you think Mommy is, penguin?

23:43.588 --> 23:46.425
We'll kick his ass. Yes, we will.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.310
Sorry.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.654
-Come on, Héctor.
-What?

24:07.737 --> 24:09.156
She's breastfeeding, dude.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.365
So, what?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.117
I'm throwing her a bone.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.372
Mariana, this is Marta, my roomie.
She's so cool.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.792
Mariana!

24:23.086 --> 24:25.172
María Pía is such a natural, right?

24:26.590 --> 24:29.009
Since when do you dance cha-cha-chá?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.178
No, no.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.262
Sorry.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.680
-From the top.
-Wait.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.557
One and center.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.726
Step forward and center.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.686
Two steps to the right.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.314
-Other side, two steps to the left.
-Okay.

24:42.397 --> 24:46.526
Move your hips! Like this. At least… No!

24:46.610 --> 24:49.905
They play it at the office parties
you never want to go to.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.784
We should invite María Pía
and Alonso over to dinner sometime.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.537
It'd be great to befriend them.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.581
Whatever.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.089
It didn't go well, did it?

25:09.299 --> 25:11.885
Turns out he's a master at cha-cha-chá.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.136
Wasn't it salsa?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.388
And he's inviting them for dinner.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.559
So, you're preparing for the occasion?

25:19.643 --> 25:21.561
Well, how did your date go?

25:22.270 --> 25:25.774
Awful. I ran out when he said
he was throwing me a bone.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.317
What?

25:27.859 --> 25:28.944
Hey, no.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.279
What's wrong with him? You're perfect.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.366
If I were a guy, I'd totally hit that.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.870
Thank you, but I guess
being a mom killed my mojo.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.580
Oh, no.

25:40.664 --> 25:44.751
Hey, I'm a mother of three.
Trust me, your mojo will come back.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.672
-This? We could…
-Yes, this one.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.298
You canceled Mario Bautista?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.633
I didn't cancel anything.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.885
Really? That's odd. My mom said you did,

25:53.969 --> 25:55.554
and you booked Mijares instead.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.931
I mean, if it was with Emmanuel…

25:58.598 --> 26:01.059
Besides, you're getting ice sculptures?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.352
You're joking, right?

26:03.061 --> 26:05.438
No one voted for you
to throw an old-lady prom.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.401
I say we remove Ceci
and vote for someone else.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.569
Yeah, for me.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.708
Okay…

26:25.208 --> 26:27.419
We should finish
the chemistry presentation.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.130
No, I don't feel like doing homework.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.591
But you always feel like doing homework.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.176
That's the old Rodrigo.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.681
I know what you're doing here.
Acting cool doesn't suit you.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.057
Besides,

26:41.141 --> 26:44.227
who plays the recorder
in this day and age?

26:44.311 --> 26:45.604
Horacio Franco.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.737
I'm done with you!

26:54.237 --> 26:56.489
Mijares? Behind my back?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.826
-Honey, that Marco Bautista--
-Mario.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.244
He was fully booked.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.330
And to listen to Reggae--

27:03.413 --> 27:06.708
Reggaeton, Mom. You never listen to me.

27:06.791 --> 27:10.170
Everything has to be your way.
Estela humiliated me.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.964
Want to hear about real humiliation?

27:13.715 --> 27:14.591
Sit down.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.888
Alma Toca and I
camped outside Mijares's house for days.

27:22.390 --> 27:26.436
-I bet he doesn't even live here.
-He does. My cousin said so.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.729
Let's just go, Alma.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.815
-No, just a little longer. Please.
-How long?

27:30.899 --> 27:33.318
-I don't know, ten minutes.
-Ten? We're out in five.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.487
-No, ten, please.
-Five, that's my last offer.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.863
I swear he lives here.

27:36.946 --> 27:37.906
Someone's coming.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.408
-Go!
-Okay.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.953
Shit! You hit him!

27:44.537 --> 27:46.873
-No, that's not him.
-Look at his curls.

27:49.584 --> 27:50.585
It's him!

27:52.462 --> 27:54.798
Estela's mom
should tell her how she screamed

27:54.881 --> 27:57.175
when Mijares finally came out.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.134
No!

27:58.218 --> 27:59.052
Yes.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.681
How far would you go

28:02.764 --> 28:05.642
to have Mario Bautista at your prom?

28:06.226 --> 28:08.978
Mom, you finally said his name right.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.234
Your strategies don't work.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.653
That's how it is, Ro.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.488
You win some, you lose some.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.994
Rodrigo, that little brat
is taking advantage of you.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.996
We were just protecting you.

28:27.080 --> 28:27.997
That's not true!

28:28.081 --> 28:29.165
It is!

28:29.249 --> 28:31.000
She's using you and other nerd kids

28:31.084 --> 28:34.337
only so you guys do her homework
while she flirts with others.

28:37.465 --> 28:40.927
But I must admit
she's a pro for someone her age.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.221
Ro…

28:46.433 --> 28:47.642
You'll be okay.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.063
Will you tell them you cooked it?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.899
Yes, Alta. Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.943
Just tell me what to do.

28:57.026 --> 29:00.447
Turn off the oven and take it out.
There's the mitten.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.489
Very well.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.242
That's all for today. Thank you.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.539
Perhaps I could help you make one.

29:09.622 --> 29:12.250
I could teach you,
now that you have some time off.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.003
No need, thanks.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.297
Excuse me.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.386
-It's delicious.
-I'll give you the recipe, it's so easy.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.972
What do you do, María Pía?

29:26.473 --> 29:27.599
Your occupation?

29:28.516 --> 29:30.143
I work at Alonso's company,

29:30.643 --> 29:34.522
but I try to carve out time
to travel whenever we feel like it.

29:36.107 --> 29:39.527
We want to learn to dive,
walk the Way of St. James

29:39.611 --> 29:42.447
and maybe take a year off
to travel the world, right?

29:42.530 --> 29:43.448
Yes.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.367
And leave the house
and the kids to themselves?

29:46.910 --> 29:48.828
It's all about planning, Ana.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.956
We have a safari scheduled for next month.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.041
Wow!

29:53.750 --> 29:55.168
Why don't you come along?

29:55.251 --> 29:57.086
It'll be out of this world.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.006
It would be awesome.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.509
You have a ton
of unused vacation days, honey.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.563
I hate safaris.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.191
I hate cooking.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.321
I hate dancing cha-cha-chá.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.407
And I especially hate women like María Pía

30:26.491 --> 30:29.160
who remind the rest of us
how imperfect we are.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.455
We don't have to go anywhere.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.417
You don't have to dance cha-cha-chá.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.295
And, luckily, we don't have to cook.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.382
I only want you to be happy.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.057
-Mom?
-Don't tell me.

30:51.724 --> 30:54.769
He left you for the masseuse.
She gave him a happy ending and--

30:54.853 --> 30:56.729
No, Mom, he didn't leave me.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.314
But…

30:58.857 --> 31:00.733
I'm not taking the promotion.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.360
I can't believe it.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.821
You let Juan Carlos have his way.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.700
-You know, Mom? Let's talk later, okay?
-Ana…

31:10.285 --> 31:11.411
Your dad left…

31:12.161 --> 31:13.580
because he wanted to.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.167
There was nothing I could do to stop him.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.926
Life is about doing what makes you happy.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.889
Even if it's drinking milk all day.
Right, baby?

31:35.101 --> 31:35.977
Everything okay?

31:36.811 --> 31:37.645
Yes.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.232
Any love news?

31:41.900 --> 31:42.734
Nothing.

31:43.526 --> 31:47.614
Maybe it's better to close up shop
until things are back to normal.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.534
It's different for you,
you have Juan Carlos.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.286
I do, but…

31:53.786 --> 31:55.830
that comes with different complications.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.666
Maybe you should…

31:59.417 --> 32:01.878
I don't know, 
try with someone you trust first.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.255
-You think?
-Yes, I do.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.759
But what's most important

32:08.509 --> 32:10.970
is accepting yourself for who you are.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.222
Flaws and all.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.517
If only it were that easy.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.145
No, it's anything but easy.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.024
But we all have to start somewhere.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.488
I'm doing it, okay?

32:29.155 --> 32:30.782
The Good Vibes Challenge.

32:30.865 --> 32:31.783
Seriously?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.370
That's embarrassing.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.290
What's wrong
with spreading good vibes all over?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.629
You have to fight hard
for your dreams, Olivia.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.839
So, here you go.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.633
Let's do this.

32:52.011 --> 32:55.598
Hi, this is Ceci Aguilar
and this is my Good Vibes Challenge.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.683
Follow me!

32:58.267 --> 33:02.522
Good vibes for you, for you and you.

33:02.605 --> 33:04.148
Good vibes for all!

33:06.317 --> 33:07.527
Hi, Mario. I love you.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.571
Cut.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.414
Paloma.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.915
What do you want, nerd?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.209
Guess what grade I got? An F.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.795
Get a good grade
on your exam and you'll make up for it.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.755
Yeah. How would I do that?

33:28.589 --> 33:30.174
My parents are going to kill me.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.178
Look, I like you.
I was given advice to hit on you.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.348
That clearly didn't work.
That's why I didn't do the presentation.

33:37.974 --> 33:41.019
I'll help you with your exam,
but you have to help me too.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.361
All right, see you later, nerd.

33:59.787 --> 34:00.621
Come in.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.627
Rodrigo just told me he kissed Paloma.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.171
-Really?
-Yes.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.256
-No way!
-I told you.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.968
We make a great team.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.763
And you, Ceci, are a very good sister.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.271
What? You don't like me?

34:25.354 --> 34:26.189
No.

34:26.814 --> 34:29.233
No, that's not it, Ceci. You're a minor.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.445
Then why did you say my name
while touching my shoulder?

34:33.738 --> 34:35.740
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.326
You're an idiot. Get out!

34:38.409 --> 34:41.245
-Get out! No!
-Ceci, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.422
Why didn't you tell me?

34:52.298 --> 34:54.133
Nothing would've changed, Tere.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.928
Besides, you never loved me back.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.764
That's true, Anuar.
We can't get back together.

35:01.682 --> 35:05.394
But Regina needs grandparents
that get along for her sake.

35:08.564 --> 35:09.690
I'll do my best.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.694
And I need someone with expertise
to help me run my business.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.988
Maybe you know somebody.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.825
I'm afraid that'll be somewhat expensive.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.076
Oh, really?

35:20.159 --> 35:23.037
Yes. But you can pay him with facials.

35:23.121 --> 35:23.955
Look at you.

35:24.038 --> 35:26.332
Always so vain,
you haven't changed in years.

35:45.476 --> 35:50.731
PABLO: ARE YOU AWAKE?
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.943
MARIANA: I'M ON MY WAY.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.196
-Hello.
-May I come in?

35:57.280 --> 35:58.239
Yes, come in.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.366
I'm glad you could come.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.618
I need to talk to you.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.163
-Later. This is more important.
-No, wait.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.582
-I want to tell you something.
-Later.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.215
I've been offered
the development officer position

36:16.299 --> 36:17.466
for Latin America.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.019
For all Latin America?

36:29.270 --> 36:31.355
But that means
traveling all the time, right?

36:33.232 --> 36:36.235
You said all you wanted
was for me to be happy.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.238
That's what makes me happy.

37:23.866 --> 37:24.784
Does it hurt?

37:32.708 --> 37:33.834
Wait.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.336
First, I have to make sure.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.088
It's just sex, right?

37:37.672 --> 37:38.673
Yes.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.960
