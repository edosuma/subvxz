WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:05.740
Well, gentlemen, it's her.

00:05.770 --> 00:08.821
Good god, are you sure?

00:08.851 --> 00:10.961
Why didn't she ever show up before this?

00:11.001 --> 00:13.161
Look at her teeth, hmm?

00:13.191 --> 00:14.442
She's got meth mouth.

00:14.482 --> 00:18.382
She's a full-on addict. She's probably
happy people thought she was dead.

00:18.422 --> 00:21.232
–Go get chief Johnson, please.
–Yes, sir.

00:23.733 --> 00:27.813
The jury convicted Bill Croelick
of killing this woman years ago.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.463
Right. Well, the jury
was wrong, apparently,

00:29.503 --> 00:31.343
because she died this
morning of an overdose.

00:31.383 --> 00:36.603
But… but… listen to me.
We know Croelick is a murderer.

00:36.623 --> 00:39.484
He's burned to death
at least one other girl.

00:39.524 --> 00:42.054
For which he was tried and found
not guilty. Get to the point.

00:42.094 --> 00:46.475
My point is, if you release
this information to the press

00:46.515 --> 00:49.045
and Johnson can't get
a confession out of him,

00:49.085 --> 00:50.795
Croelick walks out of prison a free man

00:50.835 --> 00:54.056
not because he's innocent of murder

00:54.086 --> 00:57.386
but because we misidentified his victim.

00:57.406 --> 00:59.566
What's the alternative?

01:02.177 --> 01:04.297
Do us a favor.

01:04.657 --> 01:08.658
Send this girl to the
crematorium as a Jane Doe.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.858
Keep Croelick in prison.

01:10.898 --> 01:13.368
Don't damage the
reputation of our department

01:13.408 --> 01:15.679
to let a killer go free.

01:15.719 --> 01:18.499
Here is the favor I will do for you.

01:18.689 --> 01:21.868
I will forget you said that.

01:23.559 --> 01:25.389
Sorry to keep you waiting, chief.

01:25.429 --> 01:28.479
About 3 years ago, we found
a body badly burned in a car.

01:28.519 --> 01:30.440
Lieutenant Flynn.

01:30.640 --> 01:35.610
Through dental records, we
I. D'd the vic as Lisa Barnes.

01:35.650 --> 01:39.201
I worked the case, arrested
a freak… Bill Croelick.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.601
He has a history of
barbecuing his victims.

01:41.641 --> 01:43.771
He sits on death row as we speak.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.601
So what's the problem?

01:45.641 --> 01:46.492
The problem is,

01:46.532 --> 01:50.732
this is the Lisa Barnes who Croelick
was convicted of burning up 3 years ago.

01:50.772 --> 01:55.653
She died this morning at 11:00 of
methamphetamine related heart failure.

01:55.693 --> 01:58.703
So a man's been sitting in
prison for the last 3 years

01:58.743 --> 01:59.823
for killing a woman…

01:59.863 --> 02:02.234
Who died 6 hours ago.

02:02.284 --> 02:03.194
Yeah.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.294
So who did Bill Croelick kill?

02:05.334 --> 02:08.304
That's what we need
Priority Homicide to find out

02:08.344 --> 02:10.715
before we have to release him.

02:14.564 --> 02:15.914
Thank you.

02:15.944 --> 02:16.805
Here's how it'll work.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.955
Janet Powell, the deputy
DA. who prosecuted Croelick

02:19.995 --> 02:21.485
will call his defense counsel

02:21.525 --> 02:23.855
who in turn will immediately
petition the court

02:23.895 --> 02:25.856
for a writ of habeas corpus.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.726
And the DA. won't oppose that motion?

02:27.766 --> 02:29.116
Well, they'll do what they can,

02:29.156 --> 02:30.456
but the conviction was based

02:30.496 --> 02:32.477
on tying Croelick to Lisa Barnes

02:32.517 --> 02:34.027
not just through his MO.,

02:34.067 --> 02:38.057
but also through her physical
and personal characteristics.

02:38.107 --> 02:41.038
Everybody's sure he killed somebody.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.698
Yeah, but he went to great lengths
to make sure we couldn't I. D the vic.

02:44.738 --> 02:47.599
Cut off her hands and
feet, set her on fire twice,

02:47.639 --> 02:49.669
pushed her off a cliff in a car.

02:49.709 --> 02:52.469
Sounds thorough.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.310
In order to arrest Croelick again,

02:55.350 --> 02:57.980
we have to connect him to the
young lady he actually murdered.

02:58.020 --> 03:01.360
And we may only have 48
hours before he walks.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.951
You want me to take a dry run at it?

03:04.031 --> 03:06.680
Maybe, but, uh…

03:06.710 --> 03:08.720
this guy's not your
run-of-the-mill psychopath.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.181
Thanks, Sara.

03:10.221 --> 03:12.431
He never said a word
after he was arrested,

03:12.471 --> 03:14.241
never spoke at his own trial,

03:14.281 --> 03:16.541
listens intently to his attorney.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.882
And he's been studying law in prison.

03:18.922 --> 03:21.122
Well, I'll be extra polite.

03:21.152 --> 03:24.142
Yeah and extra careful, too.

03:24.932 --> 03:26.793
Please.

03:27.073 --> 03:31.533
You're, uh, kind of his type.

03:32.744 --> 03:36.224
Deputy DA. Powell here
prosecuted Mr Croelick.

03:36.264 --> 03:40.950
She can explain some of the mistakes
made in the original I. D process.

03:42.015 --> 03:44.605
Oh, and Ms Powell, if you
could start with a few words

03:44.645 --> 03:47.525
about the body we found yesterday.

03:47.915 --> 03:49.726
Lisa Barnes grew up in Fresno,

03:49.766 --> 03:53.836
moved to the Miracle Mile area
of L. A. in '98, married in '99.

03:53.876 --> 03:56.467
Somewhere in the next year,
she picked up a meth habit.

03:56.507 --> 03:59.136
Her husband reported
her missing in 2000.

03:59.176 --> 04:03.400
In June '02, we discovered the
burned-out shell of a stolen car.

04:03.407 --> 04:06.317
Inside of it was the charred
remains of Lisa Barnes.

04:06.357 --> 04:08.257
Of who you thought was Lisa Barnes.

04:08.297 --> 04:10.137
It was a reasonable assumption.

04:10.177 --> 04:14.108
I found Lisa's driver's
license at the scene.

04:14.328 --> 04:17.678
Did you run the dental records of the
corpse through the missing persons database?

04:17.718 --> 04:21.099
–No, but we had…
–Lieutenant Tao, would you mind compiling a list

04:21.139 --> 04:24.639
of all the missing females in the
Los Angeles area during the crime.

04:24.679 --> 04:25.583
You got it.

04:25.618 --> 04:27.130
There was no need to run a search.

04:27.170 --> 04:30.180
–We had a positive I. D
–Made by whom?

04:30.210 --> 04:34.341
Dr Nelson Grayton, L.A. County's chief Forensic
odontologist. He checked 3 of the corpse…

04:34.381 --> 04:37.221
Sergeant Gabriel, could you arrange
a chat with Mr Grayton, please?

04:37.261 --> 04:39.911
–Yeah. Right on it.
–Thank you. So sorry to interrupt.

04:39.951 --> 04:41.782
Go on, Ms Powell.

04:42.342 --> 04:45.402
And on top of everything else,
Lisa was Croelick's type…

04:45.442 --> 04:49.302
Blonde, small, pretty in
that common sort of a way.

04:49.342 --> 04:52.242
In fact, she looked very
much like the other woman

04:52.282 --> 04:54.622
I prosecuted him for killing.

04:54.672 --> 04:58.283
In 2000, we… sorry. Who's “we”?

04:59.983 --> 05:02.303
It was my case, too.

05:03.643 --> 05:05.574
Another woman, burned-out car,

05:05.614 --> 05:10.064
also missing her hands
and feet. Petite, blonde.

05:10.134 --> 05:12.685
A little on the trashy side.

05:12.755 --> 05:14.275
Anna Tandy.

05:14.305 --> 05:15.675
We had no leads,

05:15.735 --> 05:18.025
and then a witness came forward.

05:18.045 --> 05:22.816
A witness knew Anna, but more
importantly, she knew Anna's boyfriend.

05:22.876 --> 05:23.696
Bill Croelick?

05:23.736 --> 05:26.396
A witness placed Croelick at the car

05:26.426 --> 05:27.737
the night Anna was murdered,

05:27.777 --> 05:29.487
and afterwards, when he was drunk,

05:29.527 --> 05:31.817
he confessed to her what he had done.

05:31.857 --> 05:34.257
Unfortunately, 4 days into the trial…

05:34.297 --> 05:36.758
Your witness overdosed
before she could testify.

05:36.798 --> 05:41.267
After our witness died, I was left
with a lot of circumstantial data,

05:41.307 --> 05:45.588
deposition, and Dr Easton, who
did Croelick's psych evaluation.

05:45.618 --> 05:48.928
I want to stress the fact that my
testimony in the case of Lisa Barnes

05:48.968 --> 05:51.799
was based on facts that have changed.

05:51.839 --> 05:54.017
I was not a part of this inquiry.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.149
Understood, Dr Easton.

05:56.169 --> 05:59.650
Myself, detective Flynn, Dr Easton…

06:00.740 --> 06:03.470
Croelick's acquittal made us sick.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.721
With Lisa Barnes, we had
another chance to put him away.

06:07.811 --> 06:11.931
So the doctor here had 2
chances to profile Croelick.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.102
I did.

06:14.892 --> 06:16.622
I even wrote about him.

06:16.652 --> 06:20.532
<i>Criminals and their
victims: a cycle of violence.</i>

06:20.572 --> 06:22.543
Croelick made an interesting chapter.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.683
I kept visiting him
after the first trial.

06:24.723 --> 06:25.743
I think it flattered him.

06:25.783 --> 06:29.504
Do you think Croelick
killed our Jane Doe?

06:29.534 --> 06:32.384
Well, based on the
similarities to his prior crime,

06:32.424 --> 06:33.593
I'd say yes.

06:33.633 --> 06:34.533
Please.

06:34.573 --> 06:37.147
Both murders demonstrated the hallmarks

06:37.164 --> 06:40.624
of a highly organized,
sexually aggressive killer,

06:40.644 --> 06:42.834
and though I'm not an expert on this,

06:42.874 --> 06:43.765
they found his fingerprints

06:43.805 --> 06:47.385
on a stainless steel
lighter on the scene.

06:48.745 --> 06:52.746
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't mean to be rude.

06:52.776 --> 06:54.416
You want some? They're sugarless.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.878
My wife buys them for our children.
Thanks. And even by the carton.

06:59.367 --> 07:03.007
Well, I only have about 5 minutes
before I have to interview this guy,

07:03.047 --> 07:05.777
so I should probably get to the basics.

07:05.807 --> 07:06.998
What is he?

07:07.038 --> 07:08.598
A borderline sociopath.

07:08.618 --> 07:10.778
You know, knows the difference
between right and wrong.

07:10.818 --> 07:14.038
Smart. I kind of feel for him.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.259
The pattern's so formulaic.

07:16.279 --> 07:17.779
His father started dropping acid

07:17.819 --> 07:20.659
when Croelick was 5 years old

07:20.679 --> 07:22.820
and ended up killing Billy's
mother in front of him

07:22.860 --> 07:25.110
by holding her face down on a lit stove.

07:25.150 --> 07:27.279
She was blonde, too, his mother?

07:27.309 --> 07:30.650
She was, and so is every
woman he's ever dated.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.420
And they're all drug users, too.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.180
Croelick's way of reuniting the family.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.100
And after the parents died?

07:36.130 --> 07:38.031
He went from foster home to foster home,

07:38.071 --> 07:40.061
becoming ever more violent.

07:40.091 --> 07:41.951
For example, he forced one family's cat

07:41.991 --> 07:44.641
to swallow an M-80 firecracker.

07:44.671 --> 07:46.302
The cat burst into flames.

07:46.342 --> 07:50.472
A year later, he beat another
child with a hot curling iron,

07:50.502 --> 07:52.513
which earned him 2 years
of juvenile detention.

07:52.553 --> 07:56.303
And after his release, he branded
his name onto a girl's forearm

07:56.343 --> 07:57.803
during intercourse.

07:57.823 --> 08:00.654
He'd become sexually aroused
by the smell of burning flesh.

08:00.694 --> 08:02.574
He fantasizes about it.

08:02.604 --> 08:05.178
And of course he smokes, 3 packs a day.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.085
I used to have my office
fumigated after his visits.

08:08.125 --> 08:11.525
And he's here, waiting.

08:12.525 --> 08:16.636
God, this guy makes me sick. Why is
she questioning him without an attorney?

08:16.676 --> 08:20.465
Declined counsel. I mirandized him
on the way in from the elevator.

08:20.505 --> 08:22.976
Well, that's a break, at least.

08:23.076 --> 08:25.616
You need a wingman? No, thanks.

08:25.656 --> 08:28.816
I think I'll have more
luck on my own. Ok.

08:32.607 --> 08:36.157
Are you sure you want to do that?

08:37.277 --> 08:38.828
I don't know.

08:43.528 --> 08:46.696
Well. Hello, William.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:55.520 --> 09:01.385
Oh, it's Bill. It's just plain Bill.

09:01.614 --> 09:04.391
All right, just plain
Bill. I'm just plain Brenda.

09:04.431 --> 09:06.619
L. A. P. D

09:09.257 --> 09:12.294
I think Bill and I will get
along better just one-on-one,

09:12.334 --> 09:16.229
so if y'all don't mind. Thanks.

09:20.785 --> 09:24.642
Well, this is a turn of events, huh?

09:26.071 --> 09:27.999
I wasn't here 3 years ago,

09:28.029 --> 09:34.552
but I heard you pled not guilty
to the murder of Lisa Barnes.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.447
It turns out you were telling the truth.

09:40.577 --> 09:43.104
But you know what?

09:43.214 --> 09:45.821
I think you do know who
burned to death in that car,

09:45.861 --> 09:47.850
just plain Bill.

09:50.028 --> 09:54.973
And I was wondering if you'd do
me a favor and tell me her name,

09:55.103 --> 09:58.140
because even though you don't
want to see Ms Powell again,

09:58.180 --> 10:01.986
she's agreed that if
you I. D the victim,

10:02.016 --> 10:05.623
she'll make the capital
part of your sentence go away

10:05.643 --> 10:09.688
and you won't have to face
the death penalty anymore.

10:11.417 --> 10:14.694
You'll even be eligible for parole.

10:15.683 --> 10:21.307
So all you have to do
is tell me the truth.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.210
Since you asked me so nice and all

10:29.250 --> 10:35.264
and since you're just… oh, you're
just cute as a bug, ain't ya? Heh!

10:35.464 --> 10:40.480
Uh… I'll tell you the truth.

10:40.579 --> 10:42.857
Do you want to hear it?

10:50.959 --> 10:56.025
In 28 hours, I'm gonna be
100% free and drunk off my ass,

10:56.045 --> 10:57.863
and there isn't one damn thing that you

10:57.903 --> 10:59.950
or anyone else can do about it.

10:59.980 --> 11:02.348
And, you know, why should I talk to you

11:02.388 --> 11:05.046
when Katie Couric
sent me a fruit basket?

11:05.086 --> 11:09.011
Extraordinary. Something's
different about him.

11:09.051 --> 11:11.680
Yeah. And it's who he's talking to.

11:11.710 --> 11:15.405
I do want to thank you very much

11:15.435 --> 11:19.882
for your southern hospitality.

11:24.736 --> 11:27.354
See, I knew you weren't alone.

11:27.584 --> 11:32.029
'Cause, you know, cute girls
like you, you're never alone.

11:32.089 --> 11:36.376
But I do so hope we
meet each other again.

11:36.525 --> 11:39.083
I never forget a face.

11:43.819 --> 11:48.473
It was wonderful to meet
you, just plain Brenda.

11:50.712 --> 11:52.818
Likewise.

12:00.359 --> 12:01.800
Hello.

12:02.070 --> 12:05.414
I'm afraid I'm the bearer of some,

12:05.454 --> 12:07.866
well, unique news.

12:07.926 --> 12:13.101
Mr Barnes, it seems that your
first wife Lisa, she's dead.

12:14.071 --> 12:17.144
Well, yes. I know that.

12:17.184 --> 12:18.645
Excuse me.

12:18.725 --> 12:21.518
Is that the emergency you
called us in to explain?

12:21.558 --> 12:24.640
You wanted to tell
Roy that Lisa is dead?

12:24.690 --> 12:26.191
Again.

12:26.262 --> 12:28.644
I mean, she wasn't murdered 3 years ago.

12:28.684 --> 12:31.066
She just died yesterday
of a drug overdose.

12:31.106 --> 12:32.757
Roy, tell me you didn't know about this.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.719
No. Of course I didn't
know about this, all right?

12:34.759 --> 12:37.152
I spoke at her funeral, for god sakes.

12:37.192 --> 12:39.664
I mean, or somebody's
funeral. I don't know.

12:39.704 --> 12:42.176
Whose funeral was it? Good god!

12:42.216 --> 12:44.658
Did you pay for that funeral? We
should get reimbursed for that.

12:44.698 --> 12:47.250
Look, can I see her body?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.142
–No way are you seeing her!
–Kimberly, hold on!

12:49.182 --> 12:50.154
Why would you even ask that?

12:50.194 --> 12:51.705
It's just that I just want to make sure

12:51.745 --> 12:54.117
that it was really her, and…

12:54.217 --> 12:56.278
I just don't want to keep
going through this again.

12:56.318 --> 13:00.813
I promise. This is the absolutely
last time that Lisa will die,

13:00.843 --> 13:03.775
and we already have a
positive I. D on the body,

13:03.815 --> 13:05.046
so we don't need you to see her again.

13:05.086 --> 13:08.960
I'm sorry. It's just that I
was so sure last time, you know?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.332
I was at the trial, and… and…

13:12.402 --> 13:17.267
if it wasn't her, where
has she been all this time?

13:17.297 --> 13:20.209
Eventually we'll be able to
answer all your questions,

13:20.249 --> 13:22.622
but for right now, we're under
a bit of a time constraint,

13:22.662 --> 13:24.413
and what I need is for
you to give me back…

13:24.453 --> 13:26.875
You want to swap bodies.

13:29.568 --> 13:32.541
Well, the good news is,
Lisa's in much better shape.

13:32.581 --> 13:33.882
Well, we don't want it.

13:33.922 --> 13:35.113
Kimberly, honey, please.

13:35.153 --> 13:36.324
Don't “honey” me.

13:36.364 --> 13:37.776
You have always been
obsessed with that woman.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.217
So help me, god, I am not going through

13:39.257 --> 13:41.428
another burial and 3 years of mourning.

13:41.468 --> 13:44.141
We are happy with the way things are.

13:44.832 --> 13:50.536
Actually, you know, Roy was
still married at your wedding.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look,

13:53.940 --> 13:58.333
my wife Lisa was declared dead, ok?

13:58.363 --> 13:59.775
I have the death certificate.

13:59.815 --> 14:02.787
So do I. Mine's a little more recent,

14:02.817 --> 14:05.489
and it could cause all
sorts of legal problems.

14:05.529 --> 14:08.513
You might need to get your marriage
annulled, have another ceremony,

14:08.553 --> 14:12.306
or we could, uh, swap the dead girls,

14:12.336 --> 14:14.989
call it even. What do you say?

14:15.059 --> 14:19.172
Oh, my god. That woman has
never been anything but trouble.

14:19.222 --> 14:22.195
Sign it and let's just get it over with.

14:30.853 --> 14:36.627
Can you at least tell me who it
was that I buried 3 years ago?

14:38.299 --> 14:41.532
Oh, I wish I could.

14:42.552 --> 14:47.417
Doesn't this look like fun, huh?

14:47.607 --> 14:49.809
Did some of her fall over there?

14:49.839 --> 14:52.962
Sergeant Gabriel, a little help, please.

14:59.477 --> 15:02.731
Now you expect me to identify this…

15:02.761 --> 15:04.612
What do we call this? Jane Doe?

15:04.652 --> 15:07.664
The body formerly known as Lisa Barnes.

15:07.694 --> 15:10.968
Doctor, we are under a
tremendous time pressure here

15:11.008 --> 15:13.230
with only a few hours
left to I. D the body.

15:13.270 --> 15:15.862
Maybe she should see a dentist.

15:31.246 --> 15:33.198
Hold this. Ow!

15:33.258 --> 15:36.030
I got a specimen jar right here.

15:38.693 --> 15:40.684
I wasn't asked to identify the victim.

15:40.724 --> 15:43.717
I was asked to confirm the
identity we already had.

15:43.757 --> 15:47.020
So you had an excuse to be sloppy.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.482
Croelick had been
held for almost 2 days.

15:49.522 --> 15:52.554
Flynn told me that if I didn't
confirm the identity of his victim

15:52.594 --> 15:54.857
–within 45 minutes…
–Hey, asshole,

15:54.887 --> 15:55.908
no one asked you to lie.

15:55.948 --> 15:58.319
I didn't lie. It's not my fault.

15:58.380 --> 16:01.413
No finger pointing, please. Facts.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.765
Lisa Barnes was a meth user.

16:03.805 --> 16:04.966
You know what that does to your mouth?

16:05.006 --> 16:07.287
Teeth take on the
consistency of ripe fruit.

16:07.327 --> 16:09.020
Right. So I wasn't surprised

16:09.060 --> 16:11.041
when I had only 3 good
molars to work with.

16:11.081 --> 16:13.993
It is consistent with Lisa
Barnes having meth mouth.

16:14.033 --> 16:16.756
Or being roasted at 1500 degrees.

16:16.796 --> 16:19.759
Vere's the x-rays of
the 3 teeth in the jar.

16:19.839 --> 16:22.481
And here are the only
x-rays I had at the time

16:22.521 --> 16:24.473
of Lisa Barnes' correlating molars.

16:24.513 --> 16:27.385
Now, you see how similar
the roots of the teeth are?

16:27.425 --> 16:29.417
The height of the bone,
the absence of filling.

16:29.457 --> 16:31.268
And with Flynn pushing me.

16:31.308 --> 16:33.461
What would be the benefit
of more time, doctor?

16:33.501 --> 16:38.755
Well, for one thing, I might have
found Lisa Barnes' more recent x-rays.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.827
They look alike to me.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.451
Yeah, well, they're not.

16:41.488 --> 16:43.089
You see how white that
area of the tooth is?

16:43.129 --> 16:44.691
Mm-hmm. That's a
brand-new filling.

16:44.731 --> 16:47.323
Now, you compare that to
the teeth in the jar…

16:47.363 --> 16:49.385
No filling.

16:49.565 --> 16:51.467
Jesus.

16:52.758 --> 16:56.531
I have a deal with HBO.
It's a documentary deal.

16:56.561 --> 16:57.762
I would appreciate another chance

16:57.802 --> 17:00.114
to identify who these
teeth actually belong to.

17:00.154 --> 17:01.645
Thank you so much for the offer, doctor,

17:01.685 --> 17:04.078
but I think I'd like a second opinion.

17:04.117 --> 17:06.040
–Uh, chief?
–Yeah.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.752
Grayton is the only Forensic
dentist in L. A. County.

17:08.791 --> 17:11.265
I can't base another
case on his assumptions.

17:11.305 --> 17:12.265
We'll find someone else.

17:12.305 --> 17:14.367
Before Croelick walks, we
have maybe an hour left.

17:14.406 --> 17:17.169
I can tell the time,
lieutenant. Thank you.

17:17.209 --> 17:21.169
Oh, man. 1000 bucks says I'm
gonna be wearing this bullshit.

17:30.009 --> 17:32.488
Thanks for hurrying.

17:32.537 --> 17:34.997
Oh, don't you look handsome today!

17:35.027 --> 17:38.393
Ok. We know our Jane Doe
was white, early thirties,

17:38.414 --> 17:40.972
probably dropped out of
sight about 3 years ago.

17:41.012 --> 17:43.986
These 40 missing women fit the profile.

17:44.014 --> 17:47.254
All I need from you is an expert
to go over these dental records,

17:47.294 --> 17:49.091
match them with these teeth,

17:49.131 --> 17:52.075
and tell me which
missing person she was.

17:52.318 --> 17:55.027
Ok. I'll bite.

17:55.106 --> 17:56.411
What's wrong with your odontologist?

17:56.451 --> 17:59.640
He's the reason we got the
wrong I. D in the first place.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.348
Brenda, how many cases
has this guy worked on?

18:01.388 --> 18:02.850
Oh, I don't want to talk
about that right now.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.500
No, no, no. Because if
this is true, if it gets out

18:04.540 --> 18:06.968
that your guy's just making
it up as he goes along,

18:07.008 --> 18:09.220
Croelick's not the only
criminal who's going free.

18:09.260 --> 18:12.204
Every defendant from every
trial this moron testified at

18:12.244 --> 18:13.754
can sue to have their cases reopened.

18:13.794 --> 18:15.857
I know. That's why shh, shh! Ok?

18:15.897 --> 18:19.572
Shh! I can do. Fast, I don't know.

18:19.602 --> 18:21.350
I'll try.

18:21.548 --> 18:23.591
Should I stop in there
and wave at the guys?

18:23.631 --> 18:25.527
No. You should hurry and help me.

18:25.567 --> 18:27.424
Please, hurry. Thank you.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.847
Hurry.

18:30.842 --> 18:34.368
Chief? Chief⁈

18:35.810 --> 18:38.467
You have a visitor.

18:43.465 --> 18:45.466
Just wanted to say goodbye

18:45.496 --> 18:47.127
and how nice it was meeting you,

18:47.167 --> 18:51.192
just plain deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

18:55.435 --> 18:59.910
Whoa! Got yourself a nice, big office…

18:59.940 --> 19:02.342
A bunch of men working for you.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.364
It's not at all how I
thought of you before.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.496
Sort of a turn-off.

19:08.137 --> 19:11.250
Not every fantasy comes true, huh?

19:11.290 --> 19:15.580
Why don't you sit down, take a
load off? I'd love to talk to you.

19:17.096 --> 19:19.578
I'm sorry. My lawyer's
waiting for me downstairs,

19:19.618 --> 19:21.480
but some other time, maybe.

19:21.530 --> 19:24.463
Count on it.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.582
The one time we absolutely
needed Miss Atlanta

19:56.622 --> 19:59.215
to get a confession, she blows it.

19:59.245 --> 20:03.569
Here's what I'm wondering. Flynn
basically got his promotion off this case.

20:03.609 --> 20:05.310
Think he might have worked the evidence?

20:05.350 --> 20:06.522
I'm beginning to think he did.

20:06.562 --> 20:08.774
That's because she's
treating him like a criminal.

20:08.814 --> 20:10.786
And our experts, too.

20:10.826 --> 20:13.839
If she had spent as much
time trying to I. D the vic

20:13.879 --> 20:15.851
as she did running down
the people who work for us,

20:15.891 --> 20:18.413
maybe this guy Croelick
wouldn't be on the streets.

20:18.453 --> 20:19.563
Yeah, or if you'd handled this case

20:19.603 --> 20:21.596
correctly the first
time, but that's the past.

20:21.636 --> 20:24.569
I'd like to solve the
problem we have now.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.341
Getting this guy Croelick

20:27.371 --> 20:29.103
is going to take teamwork.

20:29.143 --> 20:30.944
But how are we going to assemble a team

20:30.984 --> 20:32.446
with chief Johnson in charge?

20:32.486 --> 20:33.677
The FBI hates her.

20:33.717 --> 20:35.178
The DA. hates her.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.681
The Forensic specialists hate her.

20:37.712 --> 20:40.604
Everybody wants Croelick back in prison,

20:40.604 --> 20:43.046
but nobody's going to help her do it.

20:43.076 --> 20:47.330
All right. Well, how would you
suggest I change that dynamic?

20:48.521 --> 20:51.795
Commander Scott retired.

20:53.035 --> 20:56.078
Reduce chief Johnson to his rank.

20:56.098 --> 20:59.532
You will send a clear
and unambiguous signal

20:59.581 --> 21:00.923
that you are aware of the issue

21:00.963 --> 21:04.475
and that we here at L. A. P. D

21:04.506 --> 21:06.277
are serious about correcting it.

21:06.317 --> 21:08.059
That's not just a reduction in rank.

21:08.099 --> 21:10.172
That consigns her to civil service.

21:10.212 --> 21:12.273
I don't even know if that can be done.

21:12.313 --> 21:16.584
And I think it creates more
problems than it solves.

21:26.712 --> 21:28.752
I want police protection!

21:28.772 --> 21:30.884
I want my wife and kids in
protective custody right now!

21:30.924 --> 21:32.234
Whoa, whoa, wait. Calm down.

21:32.274 --> 21:33.794
Croelick called me on my private cell

21:33.834 --> 21:35.474
and told me I should start
looking out for myself.

21:35.514 --> 21:36.904
He called you, too?

21:36.954 --> 21:38.606
You see that? I am not the only one.

21:38.646 --> 21:40.846
Wait a minute. How can you
be so sure it was Croelick?

21:40.886 --> 21:43.866
He identified himself. This is how
this lunatic got off the first time.

21:43.906 --> 21:46.478
By eliminating anyone who
could testify against him!

21:46.518 --> 21:48.848
Me and my family, my kids…

21:48.878 --> 21:50.008
Grayton.

21:50.048 --> 21:52.179
How much you want to bet?

21:52.670 --> 21:54.130
Hello.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.450
Lieutenant Tao, trace.

21:55.490 --> 21:57.270
Yeah. Yeah. You listen
to me, you little…

21:57.310 --> 21:58.341
Keep him on the line.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.021
We got a call coming in on…

22:00.061 --> 22:02.242
Just wait one second, o…

22:02.392 --> 22:04.282
Great. He's gone.

22:04.452 --> 22:05.843
Too short to trace. It's all right.

22:05.883 --> 22:07.814
If that's real harassment,
we can have him arrested.

22:07.854 --> 22:08.734
I'm already on it, chief.

22:08.774 --> 22:13.415
Lieutenant Provenza, I want protective custody
for Dr Grayton, Easton, and lieutenant Flynn.

22:13.455 --> 22:14.375
Whoa, whoa, listen.

22:14.415 --> 22:16.706
I've got all the police
protection I need right here.

22:16.746 --> 22:19.407
I want to know what was
said by him and by you, too.

22:19.447 --> 22:22.477
Now, in my office, please. Thank you.

22:38.562 --> 22:40.740
What the hell are you doing here?

22:40.843 --> 22:43.373
–I'm unarmed.
–Get down!

22:44.473 --> 22:46.274
Get down!

22:48.365 --> 22:50.735
Put your face on the ground.

22:51.035 --> 22:53.355
It's all right. I know the drill.

22:55.657 --> 22:58.267
Don't you look at me!

23:00.828 --> 23:04.719
Sergeant Gabriel, I found Croelick.

23:05.179 --> 23:08.931
On my porch. Be nice
if we had some company.

23:09.401 --> 23:10.851
Thank you.

23:13.221 --> 23:16.873
Well, you were looking for me.

23:17.633 --> 23:19.733
Here I am.

23:28.748 --> 23:31.588
How'd you get my address?

23:31.618 --> 23:34.428
Why, haven't you heard? I'm a criminal.

23:34.548 --> 23:38.078
But don't worry. As it turns
out, you're not my type.

23:38.108 --> 23:40.469
Although I admit to
liking a fiery woman,

23:40.509 --> 23:43.068
you're a little on the bossy side.

23:43.648 --> 23:47.469
If you've got something private
to say to me, you'd best get to it.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.988
Yes, ma'am.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.908
All right. So, uh…

23:51.988 --> 23:53.708
Someone called my attorney

23:53.738 --> 23:55.419
saying I've made harassing phone calls,

23:55.459 --> 23:57.248
including one to a detective

23:57.288 --> 23:59.408
and that the police were looking for me

23:59.448 --> 24:03.289
and since I didn't want
to end up, you know, dead,

24:03.319 --> 24:06.448
I thought I'd save you the
trouble and turn myself in.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.598
What makes you think you'd end up dead?

24:09.888 --> 24:12.018
Flynn framed me for murder 3 years ago

24:12.058 --> 24:14.278
with deputy DA. Powell and Dr Easton,

24:14.318 --> 24:18.239
so clearly, I'd say, they'd
feel better if I ceased to exist.

24:18.279 --> 24:19.838
Maybe I would, too.

24:19.878 --> 24:22.548
Oh, but you don't know me as well.

24:25.148 --> 24:28.068
Anyway, I don't know
what they said to you,

24:28.108 --> 24:32.959
but I told them who I was in each call

24:32.999 --> 24:34.749
and asked them only
what, as individuals,

24:34.789 --> 24:37.358
they thought should happen to liars.

24:37.528 --> 24:40.679
'Cause that's what they
did. They all lied about me.

24:40.719 --> 24:42.999
Dr Grayton, obviously.

24:43.039 --> 24:44.938
In Dr Easton's profile.

24:44.968 --> 24:48.709
My psychological pathology
was made up out of thin air.

24:48.749 --> 24:51.608
He was bought and paid for by Powell,

24:51.728 --> 24:55.058
and she put me on
death row, and that's…

24:55.448 --> 24:58.279
that's a seriously unhappy place to be,

24:58.319 --> 25:00.588
just plain Brenda.

25:01.828 --> 25:06.019
Lots of folks seem to
think you belonged there.

25:12.839 --> 25:15.458
So, uh… so, sit down,

25:15.508 --> 25:17.698
and I'll explain to you why you
shouldn't be trying to put me to death

25:17.738 --> 25:21.209
for the murder of… uh,
who is it, by the way?

25:21.249 --> 25:24.908
Hurry up. You're gonna
hear sirens any minute.

25:25.628 --> 25:27.599
Well, if you look at the crime
for which I was acquitted…

25:27.639 --> 25:30.498
–That girl, that, uh…
–Anna Tandy.

25:30.538 --> 25:32.208
Whatever.

25:32.768 --> 25:35.209
Anyway, she had…

25:36.309 --> 25:38.039
Oh, there I go again.

25:38.079 --> 25:42.349
It's a technical term for
making a fire faster, hotter?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.189
An accelerant?

25:45.219 --> 25:47.568
An accelerant.

25:47.818 --> 25:49.459
Right.

25:52.199 --> 25:53.978
She had an accelerant
poured in her mouth

25:54.018 --> 25:56.538
before she was lit up.

25:56.819 --> 25:59.449
Do you know why someone would do that?

25:59.469 --> 26:02.828
Pour an accelerant
down someone's throat?

26:03.058 --> 26:04.469
No.

26:04.509 --> 26:06.759
Well, from what I've heard…

26:07.599 --> 26:11.108
It makes bodies light
up like shooting stars

26:11.138 --> 26:13.929
because of the oxygen in the lungs.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.199
And when they die,

26:16.459 --> 26:19.338
fire and light flow out of their bodies

26:19.378 --> 26:22.879
like they were
Jack-o-lanterns on Halloween.

26:26.828 --> 26:31.489
Now, I bet every tax-free dollar from
the settlement the city is sure to give me

26:31.529 --> 26:39.079
that your extra-crispy Jane Doe
was not cooked from the inside.

26:42.418 --> 26:45.089
Uh-oh. Time's up.

26:45.159 --> 26:47.469
What kind of an accelerant does that

26:47.509 --> 26:49.938
without killing the victim
before the fire starts?

26:49.978 --> 26:52.229
Well, I'd only be guessing,

26:52.249 --> 26:58.449
but how'd you like a couple triple martinis
straight up with a strong dash of pure grain alcohol?

26:58.489 --> 27:03.749
Chief⁈ Chief⁈

27:04.818 --> 27:07.429
Andy, hi! Good to see you again!

27:07.469 --> 27:11.019
–Are you hurt?
–No. I'm fine. Fine.

27:11.059 --> 27:13.579
We sent our dentist a couple
of uniforms this afternoon.

27:13.619 --> 27:15.089
Yeah? Dr Grayton?

27:15.129 --> 27:18.349
He wasn't there. He vanished. Let's go.

27:19.059 --> 27:22.188
Where were you, you sack of human waste!

27:22.239 --> 27:24.589
Where were you, huh⁈

27:26.459 --> 27:27.639
You know, if my fingerprints show up

27:27.679 --> 27:29.729
on a lighter in that dentist's pocket…

27:29.769 --> 27:31.159
Shut up, shut up!

27:31.179 --> 27:32.559
I'd be suspicious if I were you.

27:32.599 --> 27:35.469
I said, shut up!

27:38.749 --> 27:41.239
If the fire had originated
inside of your Jane Doe,

27:41.279 --> 27:43.309
there would be evidence
of the lungs exploding.

27:43.349 --> 27:44.679
Well, is there?

27:44.699 --> 27:46.849
No. Whatever was left disintegrated.

27:46.889 --> 27:48.609
Now, but this Anna girl,

27:48.639 --> 27:51.479
a few years ago, her lungs exploded.

27:51.509 --> 27:56.889
Do you think maybe you could
take another peek around inside?

27:56.919 --> 28:02.229
Tell me, chief Johnson, where
exactly do you see an inside?

28:11.649 --> 28:12.839
–Hi.
–Hey.

28:12.879 --> 28:17.509
Would you mind coming in
here for just one second?

28:21.429 --> 28:23.319
Is this my Jane Doe?

28:23.339 --> 28:24.929
So much for foreplay.

28:24.939 --> 28:26.769
Any luck on what they said
with your missing dentist?

28:26.809 --> 28:30.505
No signs of foul play. I
think he may have skipped town.

28:33.359 --> 28:34.209
What?

28:34.249 --> 28:35.639
I promise that's your girl.

28:35.679 --> 28:38.909
And she was first
reported missing june 2002.

28:38.959 --> 28:43.709
She looks almost
exactly like Lisa Barnes.

28:44.870 --> 28:48.569
Maybe we're about to get lucky.

28:48.599 --> 28:50.209
Drum roll.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.889
Here's hoping this picture
rings a bell with someone.

28:57.919 --> 28:59.519
Her name is…

28:59.549 --> 29:01.060
Samantha Jones.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.159
Can we have the lights, please?

29:03.199 --> 29:05.279
Dr Easton, you know this woman?

29:05.299 --> 29:07.279
She's chapter 8 in my book.

29:07.319 --> 29:09.770
I testified at her rape trial.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.969
And who was the arresting
officer on the case?

29:22.739 --> 29:25.000
Ok, what's going on
here? Explain it to me.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.239
Croelick has nothing to do
with this Samantha Jones at all?

29:28.279 --> 29:29.189
No. No.

29:29.229 --> 29:31.730
Samantha was raped
by some other scumbag.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.090
And we had a hell of a time

29:33.130 --> 29:35.149
getting her to testify against him.

29:35.189 --> 29:38.269
I mean, the woman was unstable, needy.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.260
I think Easton even
talked to her parents.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.969
I told them she was about
ready to have a meltdown.

29:43.009 --> 29:46.970
I mean, hey, you ask some
of these chicks about it,

29:46.990 --> 29:50.219
and they would rather, like, be
murdered than sexually assaulted.

29:50.259 --> 29:54.080
Samantha said that.
It's in Easton's records.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.100
Some women just can't deal with rape,

29:56.140 --> 29:57.189
and when she disappeared,

29:57.229 --> 29:59.935
we all thought she
had committed suicide.

29:59.959 --> 30:02.190
Well, I suppose she could have lifted

30:02.230 --> 30:04.560
Bill Croelick's stainless
steel cigarette lighter,

30:04.600 --> 30:06.249
making sure his prints were still on it,

30:06.289 --> 30:08.439
made a copy of Lisa Barnes' license,

30:08.479 --> 30:11.130
stolen a car, pushed it off a cliff,

30:11.160 --> 30:12.290
chopping off her hands and feet

30:12.330 --> 30:13.849
while discarding them en route

30:13.889 --> 30:15.729
after setting fire to herself.

30:15.769 --> 30:18.660
Maybe she trained for her
suicide at the Cirque de Soleil.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.230
I don't know.

30:20.330 --> 30:22.829
But it seems much more reasonable

30:22.879 --> 30:24.870
that she was murdered

30:24.930 --> 30:29.389
and someone planted the evidence
after the fact, doesn't it?

30:30.339 --> 30:33.320
Actually, chief, it is possible,

30:33.370 --> 30:36.659
listening to this from a
purely objective point of view,

30:36.699 --> 30:39.109
that this girl Samantha
did commit suicide,

30:39.149 --> 30:43.030
and then someone who was
familiar with the Croelick case,

30:43.070 --> 30:44.439
Croelick's MO.,

30:44.479 --> 30:47.350
and understandably eager
to put this maniac away,

30:47.390 --> 30:48.500
might have made her death look like…

30:48.540 --> 30:52.419
Hey. What is this?

30:52.869 --> 30:56.310
I'm just saying there's a
lot of mistakes your end.

30:56.360 --> 31:02.219
And I just think internal affairs
should investigate this whole situation.

31:10.180 --> 31:12.110
Do you agree?

31:12.610 --> 31:14.290
No.

31:14.380 --> 31:17.449
No, I don't. Not yet.

31:17.479 --> 31:22.693
I'd like to have a private discussion
with lieutenant Flynn, if you don't mind.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.780
You must be so happy right now.

31:30.810 --> 31:33.540
Can't wait to see me
get ripped apart. God.

31:33.580 --> 31:36.370
You know what? In the
general scheme of things,

31:36.410 --> 31:39.729
you matter to me about as
much as a june bug in july.

31:39.769 --> 31:43.030
But if you're interested in
keeping your job and your rank,

31:43.070 --> 31:45.010
you'd better answer my
questions, lieutenant,

31:45.050 --> 31:49.000
and without all the usual
crap I have to take from you.

31:52.270 --> 31:56.000
3 years ago, Samantha
Jones, a rape victim,

31:56.020 --> 31:57.360
was murdered in the same way

31:57.400 --> 31:59.540
that Bill Croelick kills his victims.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.650
Looks that way.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.264
And another coincidence…

32:02.270 --> 32:04.780
Samantha was the same
height, weight, and color

32:04.820 --> 32:06.840
as another missing girl, Lisa Barnes,

32:06.880 --> 32:08.690
a drug addict living on the streets.

32:08.730 --> 32:11.130
Yeah. They do look a lot alike.

32:11.150 --> 32:14.840
Hey, I don't know whether someone
wanted to frame Bill Croelick

32:14.880 --> 32:17.570
or someone wanted us to think
that Lisa Barnes was dead

32:17.610 --> 32:22.500
or someone wanted us to
misidentify Samantha Jones, ok?

32:23.710 --> 32:26.600
Someone planted Lisa's
driver's license on the scene.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.740
Did you do that, lieutenant?

32:29.810 --> 32:34.929
Did you tamper with the evidence because
you saw a promotion in your future?

32:37.680 --> 32:38.998
No.

32:47.935 --> 32:50.718
I have an audit of your investigation.

32:50.798 --> 32:53.988
8 print packages came
back from the crime scene.

32:53.998 --> 32:56.690
“A” through “G”… 7 before the trial.

32:56.710 --> 33:00.091
Those packages went to the
courthouse and “H” stayed here.

33:00.131 --> 33:01.008
Why?

33:01.048 --> 33:03.172
They arrived late. The case was over.

33:03.212 --> 33:05.895
Look, the last package didn't help.

33:05.925 --> 33:08.088
They were partials and palm prints.

33:08.128 --> 33:10.581
You mean they didn't
match Bill Croelick's.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.616
So? The car was stolen.

33:12.646 --> 33:14.789
The partials could
have belonged to anyone.

33:14.829 --> 33:17.182
The prints were on the car?

33:17.252 --> 33:19.875
There were palm prints other
than Croelick's on the car?

33:19.915 --> 33:20.922
Where on the car?

33:20.962 --> 33:24.173
Over the taillight.
S. I. D got to it late.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.768
But they weren't material… god.

33:25.808 --> 33:28.850
Look, there was no palm
print database back then.

33:28.890 --> 33:31.442
And you can't find a criminal with it.

33:31.472 --> 33:34.573
You can only match it to someone
you already have in custody.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.309
What'd I do wrong? You tell me!

33:36.349 --> 33:38.064
Get me the taillight of that car.

33:38.104 --> 33:40.476
And I want all the copies of
the prints for package “H”.

33:40.516 --> 33:44.206
And you keep this information completely
to yourself, lieutenant, you understand me?

33:44.246 --> 33:46.978
Because that is a direct order!

33:47.357 --> 33:49.222
Yes, ma'am.

33:54.138 --> 33:57.728
You're not gonna move
to have me investigated?

34:00.111 --> 34:02.425
No.

34:03.302 --> 34:07.241
Get me the print packages
off that car. Please.

34:07.361 --> 34:08.859
Thank you.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.809
We've done what you asked.

34:12.849 --> 34:14.746
We've changed the bodies.
It is costing us a fortune.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.379
What Roy went through for that bitch…

34:16.418 --> 34:18.446
Why aren't you questioning
her family or friends?

34:18.485 --> 34:19.630
We hated her!

34:19.630 --> 34:21.648
As it turns out, lots of
killers hate their victims.

34:21.688 --> 34:23.272
–Go figure.
–Wait, wait.

34:23.331 --> 34:25.900
You're not seriously accusing
us of murder, are you?

34:25.940 --> 34:28.250
That is just ridiculous and unfair…

34:29.228 --> 34:31.833
You have the right to remain
silent. Why don't you use it?

34:31.873 --> 34:35.196
Just for a minute, really!
Ma'am, inside. Please.

34:37.313 --> 34:38.458
You… with me.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.364
Over here.

34:42.083 --> 34:46.194
Here's what I think is possible,
but I have absolutely no proof,

34:46.234 --> 34:48.898
which is a bad place for me to
be when going into an interview.

34:48.938 --> 34:51.369
Well, I understand that. But
reactions can tell me a lot.

34:51.409 --> 34:53.186
And we still have Bill Croelick in jail?

34:53.226 --> 34:55.647
Yeah, but all his legal
study in prison paid off.

34:55.687 --> 34:58.823
Technically, his phone calls don't
rise to the level of harassment,

34:58.863 --> 35:00.246
so we're gonna have to let him go.

35:00.286 --> 35:01.456
Again.

35:01.456 --> 35:02.908
All right, never mind.

35:03.031 --> 35:04.573
Doctor, you'll be wearing an ear piece

35:04.613 --> 35:06.118
when you interview these people,

35:06.158 --> 35:08.123
and I'll be making suggestions.

35:08.163 --> 35:10.251
Ok. So…

35:11.782 --> 35:13.432
Let's see if this tracks.

35:13.562 --> 35:16.278
Roy Barnes reported his wife missing.

35:16.278 --> 35:17.420
–Fact.
–Right.

35:18.239 --> 35:19.559
Here's another fact.

35:19.683 --> 35:23.543
–Everyone wanted us to think that
it was Lisa who died in that car. –Right.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.929
She'd been missing for a long
time. She was a drug addict.

35:25.969 --> 35:28.370
It was very, very
possible that she was dead.

35:28.410 --> 35:33.077
But Roy couldn't marry until his
wife was declared legally deceased.

35:33.246 --> 35:35.595
Fact. What I wanna know

35:35.777 --> 35:38.625
is if either Roy or Kimberly
or both of them together

35:38.665 --> 35:42.280
had the ability to plan
a murder this complex.

35:42.772 --> 35:45.022
And the emotional
coolness to pull it off.

35:45.062 --> 35:47.381
Right. And here's the
most important thing…

35:47.421 --> 35:50.523
I need you to get them
to grab a glass of water

35:50.699 --> 35:53.207
and leave it in the room when they go.

35:53.507 --> 35:54.716
Can you do that?

35:54.894 --> 35:56.696
Well, probably, but why
leave behind the glass?

35:56.736 --> 35:58.394
I need to get their palm prints,

35:58.434 --> 36:00.846
but I need to do it legally.

36:00.922 --> 36:02.326
Ok.

36:02.754 --> 36:05.727
Buzz, could you turn on the
recording equipment in here, please,

36:05.767 --> 36:07.538
as well as the interview rooms?

36:07.578 --> 36:08.449
Yes, ma'am.

36:08.658 --> 36:09.700
Thank you.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.838
We'll be recording all this.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.632
What did you ask me?

36:13.672 --> 36:16.713
Oh, right. When someone leaves
their glass behind deliberately,

36:16.753 --> 36:19.039
that means they don't
consider it theirs legally,

36:19.079 --> 36:20.479
and I can take the prints off it

36:20.519 --> 36:23.819
even if I don't have
probable cause to ask for it.

36:23.848 --> 36:27.093
It's the difference between
solicitation and entrapment,

36:27.133 --> 36:29.560
and we don't want to be
accused of entrapment.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.029
Here you go. Doctor.

36:32.197 --> 36:33.979
I will be right in your ear

36:34.515 --> 36:36.495
tryin' hard not to bother you.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.134
Ok. They're ready for their close-up.

36:41.174 --> 36:44.275
Declined counsel on the grounds that
they're innocent and it's too expensive.

36:44.315 --> 36:45.244
All right, Dr Easton,

36:45.284 --> 36:47.264
could you start with Roy here?

36:56.288 --> 36:58.651
Lieutenant Tao, you
have everything you need?

36:58.691 --> 36:59.583
Yes, ma'am.

37:00.457 --> 37:01.283
Hello, Roy.

37:02.482 --> 37:03.546
I'm Dr Easton.

37:04.365 --> 37:06.495
Yeah. Yeah. I remember you.

37:06.906 --> 37:08.622
You're a psychiatrist and…

37:09.146 --> 37:11.006
testified at Lisa's murder trial.

37:11.046 --> 37:13.543
But Lisa wasn't murdered, was she?

37:14.136 --> 37:16.744
Well… I mean, I don't know.

37:16.917 --> 37:18.455
First they're saying
she was, now she's not,

37:18.495 --> 37:21.746
–but, uh… now I'm here.
–So you're upset?

37:22.066 --> 37:23.189
Yes!

37:23.364 --> 37:25.231
Offer him a glass of water.

37:25.733 --> 37:29.124
'Cause, I mean, my wife
wasn't even killed, really.

37:29.359 --> 37:33.385
No, the victim turned out to
be someone named Samantha Jones.

37:33.749 --> 37:34.522
Would you like…

37:34.562 --> 37:36.806
No, no, no, no, no. Don't ask him.

37:37.435 --> 37:39.104
Would I like a what?

37:39.696 --> 37:40.900
Would you like to tell me

37:40.940 --> 37:43.217
if you'd ever heard of a young
lady named Samantha Jones?

37:43.257 --> 37:45.579
Just pour a glass of water for yourself,

37:45.619 --> 37:46.928
and one for him…

37:47.062 --> 37:50.230
Because she looked remarkably
like your ex-wife…

37:50.668 --> 37:53.187
and your present one,
too, for that matter.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.224
And?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.933
Put it in front of him. He'll drink it.

37:57.610 --> 38:00.052
There's a thought abroad in the land…

38:00.332 --> 38:03.446
that you might have murdered
Samantha because she looked like Lisa,

38:03.486 --> 38:06.720
because you wanted people
to think Lisa was dead.

38:08.127 --> 38:09.776
What… that…

38:09.945 --> 38:12.141
I'm sorry. That… that's ridiculous,

38:12.181 --> 38:15.200
all right? I had no idea where Lisa was.

38:16.054 --> 38:21.202
You know, I… I… I gave up looking for
her long before she ever turned up dead.

38:24.203 --> 38:26.116
Thank you, doctor.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.825
And you weren't upset when she left?

38:31.865 --> 38:33.970
Yes. Yes, I was.

38:34.509 --> 38:37.867
But now, I swear, I wish
I'd never even met the bitch.

38:37.907 --> 38:39.430
I mean, she totally…

38:39.586 --> 38:42.237
Now ask him if he wants
to take his water with him,

38:42.277 --> 38:45.186
and if he says no, head
on into the murder room

38:45.226 --> 38:47.385
and get ready for your next interview.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.813
Lisa didn't used to be
that way, either. Ok?

38:49.853 --> 38:52.338
She was a really good person once.

38:52.479 --> 38:54.166
She was, and, uh…

38:54.323 --> 38:56.440
Drugs can do terrible things to people.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.459
Come on.

38:58.258 --> 39:00.007
Come on, let me find you some tissues.

39:00.047 --> 39:01.060
Come on.

39:01.819 --> 39:03.535
You wanna take your water?

39:04.694 --> 39:06.006
No. Thank you.

39:06.051 --> 39:07.767
All right, let's go, then.

39:13.796 --> 39:17.228
You know, questions like
this can be very stressful.

39:21.635 --> 39:23.382
Why don't you just
take a couple of breaths

39:23.422 --> 39:25.346
and rest here a second with, uh…

39:25.386 --> 39:26.955
Just leave him seated at a desk,

39:26.995 --> 39:29.569
and head on to the next interview room.

39:29.586 --> 39:32.433
Why don't you, uh, take
a seat right here, Roy?

39:32.473 --> 39:33.602
Which way to the, uh…

39:33.642 --> 39:35.292
Uh, it's back down there.

39:35.482 --> 39:36.989
Thank you.

39:37.325 --> 39:38.677
Move slowly…

39:38.875 --> 39:40.070
and listen…

39:40.869 --> 39:43.760
I have a couple of questions
before you go in to see Kimberly.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.233
Ok.

39:45.441 --> 39:48.369
Because while she and
Roy both had a motive,

39:48.404 --> 39:51.335
the murderer had to be someone

39:51.370 --> 39:54.537
who knew almost exactly how
Croelick kills his victims

39:54.577 --> 39:57.874
and someone who was in a
position to manipulate Croelick

39:57.914 --> 40:00.792
into picking up a stainless
steel cigarette lighter

40:00.832 --> 40:04.270
so it could be dropped
later at the crime scene…

40:04.305 --> 40:07.486
Kind of like how you manipulated Roy

40:07.521 --> 40:09.076
into picking up his glass just now.

40:09.116 --> 40:14.682
And you did say Croelick smoked
a lot in your office, didn't you?

40:14.717 --> 40:18.283
Someone who knew Samantha Jones…

40:18.318 --> 40:21.055
and someone who might
have had special clearance

40:21.095 --> 40:22.654
to the missing persons database

40:22.694 --> 40:25.848
which you got in the
first trial of Anna Tandy.

40:25.883 --> 40:32.769
Brenda, do you know what you're doing?

40:32.804 --> 40:34.402
I'm closin' my case.

40:34.437 --> 40:35.748
And opening a hundred more.

40:35.788 --> 40:38.105
Do you want me to stop?

40:38.140 --> 40:44.719
Why did you…

40:44.754 --> 40:46.788
You tricked me.

40:46.823 --> 40:48.898
You used false pretenses to…

40:48.933 --> 40:51.524
What print are you trying to match?

40:51.559 --> 40:53.940
Why are you trying to match
my print? There was nothing!

40:53.980 --> 40:55.187
I have it!

40:55.222 --> 40:56.217
What print are you trying to match?

40:56.257 --> 40:57.402
It's good!

40:57.437 --> 40:59.403
The palm print on the back of the car

40:59.443 --> 41:02.350
Samantha Jones was in when
you pushed her off a cliff.

41:02.390 --> 41:04.117
I warned you, doctor.

41:04.152 --> 41:06.202
Leave the glass behind,
and you've abandoned it.

41:06.242 --> 41:09.057
Look, you were the
only one who ever said

41:09.092 --> 41:11.631
Samantha Jones was suicidally depressed.

41:11.671 --> 41:12.906
She was, uh…

41:12.941 --> 41:15.136
She threatened to talk to my wife.

41:15.176 --> 41:18.921
I tried to make the best of it
I could! I am not a criminal.

41:18.961 --> 41:21.643
Doctor…

41:21.678 --> 41:23.473
You have the right to remain silent.

41:23.513 --> 41:30.109
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

41:30.144 --> 41:31.830
in a court of law.

41:31.865 --> 41:36.697
Hey! Hey, come here! Come here!

41:36.732 --> 41:39.481
Grab that son of a bitch!

41:39.516 --> 41:47.558
Gimme your hand! Gimme your hand!

41:55.516 --> 41:57.599
Get him up. Get him up. Get him up.

41:57.639 --> 41:59.254
All right. All right,
all right, lieutenant!

41:59.294 --> 42:05.452
Lieutenant! Hey! Lieutenant!
All right! All right!

42:05.487 --> 42:07.200
I… I demand an attorney.

42:07.235 --> 42:08.936
Yeah, well…

42:08.971 --> 42:12.820
I'll get you a phonebook. Let's go.

42:12.855 --> 42:15.409
You're pretty quick for a little guy.

42:15.444 --> 42:23.250
Well, that's one arrest
that's really gonna cost her.

42:23.285 --> 42:27.436
You wanna gloat to
someone you're close to?

42:27.471 --> 42:29.835
Grab a mirror, captain.

42:29.870 --> 42:33.344
I'm applying for permanent
transfer to her squad.

42:46.484 --> 42:48.023
My, my, my.

42:48.105 --> 42:51.261
What a lot of trouble
you caused for yourself.

42:53.725 --> 42:55.034
And all for me.

42:58.272 --> 42:59.889
Imagine Dr Easton…

43:00.714 --> 43:02.362
Having an affair with a rape victim,

43:02.402 --> 43:05.512
then murdering her
just to keep it quiet.

43:06.104 --> 43:08.470
What a monster,

43:08.826 --> 43:10.989
wouldn't you say?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.843
I don't believe in monsters.

43:17.373 --> 43:19.244
Tell me, plain Brenda.

43:20.228 --> 43:23.324
Do you smoke after sex?

43:25.039 --> 43:27.789
It's an old joke. You know how it goes.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.815
Do you smoke after sex?

43:31.687 --> 43:35.564
I don't know. I never looked.

43:38.579 --> 43:41.188
Well, let's just leave
it that way, shall we…

43:41.228 --> 43:43.298
not looking?

43:43.481 --> 43:47.622
Let's just… leave
things the way they are.

43:50.849 --> 43:54.351
And have a nightcap on the
way home, why don't you?

43:54.544 --> 43:57.315
Little triple martini…

43:57.406 --> 44:00.734
in my honor.
