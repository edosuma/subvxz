Mr. Mayor, you're in my chair.

I heard you and your
deputies had a busy morning.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.843
Uh...
We have a few leads.

05:32.878 --> 05:36.427
- Yeah, I read through the files.
- These files are confidential.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.343
And in case you forgot, you're still
a person of interest in this case.

05:39.378 --> 05:42.677
And if I wasn't out there wasting my
time shutting down fuck films for you,

05:42.712 --> 05:44.718

You didn't turn your back on just me.

09:02.388 --> 09:04.847
- Job's dead.
- Why, because Dalton said so?

09:04.882 --> 09:08.138
No, because that's what
they do with people like Job.

09:08.173 --> 09:12.180

- There was nowhere left to look.

- But that's what you feel, isn't it?

11:00.638 --> 11:02.026

agreement were pretty clear.

responsible for any errors.

My men are solid. I can vouch for them,
but the director's a freelancer.

There's no telling who he'd rat out
to save his own ass.

to prove your ineptitude.

39:52.055 --> 39:55.888
How can Watts be so fucking blind?

39:55.923 --> 39:58.471
Proctor's got us running around
like niggers in the field doing

39:58.472 --> 40:01.020
all the hard work while that
motherfucker just keeps getting richer.

40:03.155 --> 40:05.180
[scoffs]
Maybe all that time in the cage

40:05.215 --> 40:07.937
and Watts doesn't mind taking
it up the ass, but I fucking do.

40:11.013 --> 40:13.472
I'm done being everybody's bitch.

40:16.138 --> 40:17.972
<i>Yeah, what are you gonna do?</i>

40:21.472 --> 40:26.388
I'm going to wait for the right moment

40:26.423 --> 40:29.305
and then I'm going to fucking seize it.

40:34.673 --> 40:37.222
<i>who the fuck we are.</i>

40:37.257 --> 40:39.263
Sometimes I wonder if
I'm the only one who sees

40:39.298 --> 40:40.763
how batshit crazy this world has become.

40:40.798 --> 40:44.930
- Please don't kill me.
- Watts has lost his vision.

40:44.965 --> 40:45.930
Fuck Watts.

40:49.472 --> 40:51.847
He doesn't care that our
families are in danger,

40:51.882 --> 40:53.388
that our future is on
the brink, but I do.

40:53.423 --> 40:54.805
[screaming]

40:54.840 --> 40:58.222
Fortune favors the bold.

40:58.257 --> 41:02.180
Power comes from being willing
to do whatever it takes.

41:02.215 --> 41:04.275
Killing you would be much too easy.

41:05.013 --> 41:07.597
[screams]

41:07.632 --> 41:09.722
Justice at any cost.

41:11.638 --> 41:14.097
I'll be watching you.

41:30.847 --> 41:34.555
Hello?
Who's there?

41:41.847 --> 41:43.263
Hello?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.930
I don't want any trouble, Proctor.

41:58.972 --> 42:03.097
I didn't kill Rebecca.
I swear to God.

42:04.847 --> 42:06.388
You can tell him that yourself.

42:17.555 --> 42:20.430
Please. Please.
