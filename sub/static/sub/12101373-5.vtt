00:35.458 --> 00:37.458
[ominous music playing]

00:45.541 --> 00:48.333
[train horn blaring]

00:59.916 --> 01:01.791
[footsteps approaching]

01:06.250 --> 01:08.458
[footsteps leaving]

01:09.458 --> 01:11.458
[ticking]

01:17.875 --> 01:18.875
[yawns]

01:25.166 --> 01:27.291
[thump then metal screeching]

01:50.000 --> 01:52.583
[door opens then closes]

02:02.166 --> 02:03.958
What are we stopping here for?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.791
[indistinct whispering]

02:15.875 --> 02:18.125
-[gasps]
-Please get back on board, sir.

02:20.583 --> 02:23.291
-What happened?
-Just a brief stop.

02:23.375 --> 02:26.000
Now, please, sir, return to your cabin.

02:26.541 --> 02:29.875
-Is something wrong with the engine?
-Nothing of consequence.

02:29.958 --> 02:33.458
The boiler. Just need to build up
another head of steam.

02:34.416 --> 02:36.416
Then, surely, I have time for a smoke.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.916
Yes, but... don't wander.

02:40.458 --> 02:45.291
Once we're ready to go, I'll call for you
to get on board, but only twice.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.166
Then we go no matter what.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.875
[indistinct whispering continues]

03:03.208 --> 03:05.583
[dramatic music playing]

03:10.333 --> 03:12.666

03:46.708 --> 03:49.083
[insects chirping]

04:12.583 --> 04:14.208
[ominous music playing]

04:16.583 --> 04:17.583
Oh.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.583
[chuckling]

04:26.416 --> 04:27.625
[railman] All aboard!

04:30.541 --> 04:32.708
[rustling]

04:32.791 --> 04:35.833
[footsteps leaving]

04:47.458 --> 04:48.291
Shit.

04:48.833 --> 04:51.583
Hello! Hello! I'm here!

04:52.083 --> 04:53.041
Can you hear me?

04:55.791 --> 04:56.625
Hello!

05:00.750 --> 05:03.166
-[railman] All aboard!
-Wait.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.500
Wait! I'm here! Wait!

05:07.125 --> 05:08.250
Please! Wait!

05:08.333 --> 05:11.166
[suspenseful music playing]

05:12.041 --> 05:12.875
Fuck!

05:15.041 --> 05:16.791
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

05:21.666 --> 05:22.500
[rustling]

05:23.541 --> 05:25.250
-[creature growls]
-What?

05:25.333 --> 05:26.875
[rustling continues]

05:28.458 --> 05:29.833
[creature growls]

05:31.625 --> 05:32.458
Hello?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.166
[growling continues]

05:40.833 --> 05:41.958
What the--?

05:43.666 --> 05:44.833
Oh, my God.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.666
[shrieks]

05:49.666 --> 05:51.250
-[Lairo screams]
-[creatures snarling]

06:04.208 --> 06:06.041
[grunting]

06:08.875 --> 06:11.583
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.583
[panting]

06:15.166 --> 06:16.250
[gasps]

06:17.166 --> 06:18.875

[Lairo screams]

06:28.583 --> 06:30.041
[roars]

06:31.833 --> 06:32.708
Get back!

06:38.625 --> 06:40.333
-[creature growling]
-Get back!

06:43.875 --> 06:45.083
Oh, my God.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.208
[grunting]

06:48.166 --> 06:49.208
The train.

06:51.541 --> 06:52.708
Hey!

06:52.791 --> 06:53.916
Wait!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.291
Please, wait!

07:01.625 --> 07:02.625
[shrieks]

07:03.291 --> 07:04.500
[snarling]

07:11.791 --> 07:12.791
[whimpering]

07:13.375 --> 07:15.166
[roars]

07:17.708 --> 07:20.416
[heavy breathing]

07:20.500 --> 07:21.916
[dramatic music playing]

07:25.625 --> 07:26.791
[railman] Get lost!

07:26.875 --> 07:28.041
Begone!

07:28.125 --> 07:29.250
Get back!

07:29.333 --> 07:30.583
Get off!

07:30.666 --> 07:32.416
-Get moving!
-[snarling]

07:36.875 --> 07:37.833
Let's go!

07:37.916 --> 07:38.791
Come on!

07:41.041 --> 07:43.291
[roars]

07:45.166 --> 07:48.625
-[panting]
-[train horn blaring]

07:48.708 --> 07:49.666
Get up here.

07:52.250 --> 07:55.000
They-- They don't like fire.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.666
They don't like it at all.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.083
What are those things?

08:01.083 --> 08:04.833
Near as I can tell,
most of them used to be people.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.250
Maybe some got lost crossing the plains.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.125
Or maybe others got off the train
at the wrong place.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.000
I don't know.

08:15.083 --> 08:18.208
This... This has happened before?

08:19.083 --> 08:20.750
Happens every now and then.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.083
The train loses steam always at this spot.

08:25.958 --> 08:30.375
And then it's like
a kind of door opens up out there.

08:32.791 --> 08:36.791
I figure it leads to some other world.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.875
[dramatic music playing]

08:46.500 --> 08:50.541
Sir... best not to mention this to anyone.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.416
They won't believe you anyway.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.958
[creatures growling]

09:22.666 --> 09:26.166
