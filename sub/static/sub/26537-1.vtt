00:17.267 --> 00:18.768

- 27.

00:18.894 --> 00:19.769
Yeah.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.980

- Absolutely.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.002
<i>It's a wild, beautiful,
crazy adventure,</i>

01:26.211 --> 01:28.213
a race unlike any other.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.132
<i>It is the Baja 1000.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:34.219
How did <i>I</i> get here?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.930
<i>Well, let's go back a bit.</i>

01:48.358 --> 01:49.776
The <i>biggest party</i> in Baja

01:49.901 --> 01:51.235
<i>is still the--</i>

01:51.361 --> 01:53.821
<i>Our journey began
at the previous 1000.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:57.283
<i>A decade ago, I made</i> a <i>film
about it, Dust to Glory.</i>

01:57.784 --> 02:00.411
<i>Now, thanks to Roger
Norman, the head of SCORE,</i>

02:00.579 --> 02:02.372
<i>the organization
that runs this race,</i>

02:02.706 --> 02:03.915
<i>I was planning another.</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:05.291
<i>This time we'll follow</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:08.252
<i>the entire World Desert

02:15.385 --> 02:17.595
<i>battles had out there,
right now that is--</i>

02:17.763 --> 02:19.139
So many stories,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.891
<i>from the overall
winner Rob MacCachren,</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:25.019
<i>to the fastest on two
wheels, Colton Udall,</i>

02:25.187 --> 02:28.148
<i>leader of the unbeatable
Ox Motorsports team,</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:29.357
Colton Udall

02:29.524 --> 02:30.942

that overall win.</i>

<i>Dana". To Warrior Built,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.196
<i>racing on a motorcycle,</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:39.826
to Baja <i>icon,</i>
78-year-old Rod Hall,

02:39.993 --> 02:43.997
<i>the only person to race
in all 48 Baja 1000s.</i>

02:44.956 --> 02:48.000
<i>However, the most amazing
competitor in that race</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:50.712
<i>was a first-timer,
Lyndon Jones.</i>

02:51.004 --> 02:54.048
<i>Lyndon bought a motorcycle
in his home state of Utah,</i>

02:54.216 --> 02:57.469
<i>headed south of the border for
the first time in his life.</i>

02:57.636 --> 03:02.098
<i>Without support or spare parts,
he attempted the race</i> solo.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.060
<i>At safety inspection,
Lyndon's shoes earned him</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:08.313
a <i>nickname from the
SCORE officials.</i>

03:09.231 --> 03:10.523
His nickname is Wingtip.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.192
Yeah, he doesn't even
know any of us know him,

03:12.359 --> 03:14.402
or anything, we just kind of
affectionately called him that

03:14.486 --> 03:16.905
'cause he showed up to
tech wearing wingtip shoes

03:17.072 --> 03:20.909
and a business suit,
casual, so.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.161
Lookin' sharp, though, he
was definitely lookin' sharp.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.871
He is the most
text-queried person

03:24.955 --> 03:26.164
in our system right now.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.540
More people are checkin' on him

03:27.666 --> 03:28.750
- than anyone else to see
- Are they really?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.293
- What's goin' on, yeah.
- Wow, that's awesome.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.503
- Yeah.
- This has gone viral.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.713
How trippy is
that gonna be for him?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.882
Like, just greeted
by, "Hey Wingtip!"

03:36.049 --> 03:38.009
He's gonna go, like, "I think
you got the wrong guy."

03:41.930 --> 03:45.224
<i>Even though Lyndon's time to
finish officially had passed,</i>

03:45.434 --> 03:48.145
<i>the SCORE staff
and Roger Norman</i>

03:48.270 --> 03:50.188
<i>made sure he had
a hero's welcome.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:52.732
A non-vote of
confidence, I go,

03:53.024 --> 03:55.192
"Listen, I'm gonna
tell you right now,

03:55.277 --> 03:58.863
"if you make it
more than 400 miles,

03:59.030 --> 04:00.281
consider it a success."

04:00.532 --> 04:02.033
And he's like, "Thanks, man."

04:02.784 --> 04:04.202
And now I feel like such a jerk,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.537
because I'm like, dude,
he's gonna do like 900.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.955
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.291
Unbelievable.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.500
Check <i>it</i> out,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.043
he just came from
Utah, came down here,

04:12.210 --> 04:14.545
<i>no chase crew, all by himself,</i>

04:14.713 --> 04:17.173
<i>on a brand-new motorcycle
that speeds him,</i>

04:17.423 --> 04:18.507
<i>let's hear it once again,</i>

04:18.716 --> 04:20.760
<i>put your hands together, folks,
this is Wingtip.</i>

04:22.763 --> 04:24.890
<i>Dana". Lyndon
Jones started alone,</i>

04:25.056 --> 04:28.267
<i>and finished the race with
a new group of friends.</i>

04:28.435 --> 04:29.769
<i>All
the SCORE officials,</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:32.021
<i>we knew he timed out, but
this is his first attempt,</i>

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
<i>and amazing to see this man
come across the finish line.</i>

04:34.232 --> 04:35.942
- You're awesome!
- For the <i>first</i> time

04:36.026 --> 04:38.069
down here at the Baja <i>1000.</i>

04:38.195 --> 04:40.405
Did you
pre-run the course at all?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.240
No, not at all.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.117
All right,
did you bring spare tires?

04:46.495 --> 04:47.621
No, I did not.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.290
Look at the tires.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.002
Did you ever
watch Dust to Glory?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.340
Yeah, there's a lot more dust
than there is glory in this.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.552
Woke up Friday morning,

05:02.719 --> 05:05.888
and had to fulfill
the dream of my life.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.475
<i>We talked to Wingtip</i>

05:08.600 --> 05:10.351
<i>about featuring
him in this film.</i>

05:10.519 --> 05:13.730
<i>Sadly, Lyndon Jones would
pass away that spring.</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:18.068
<i>Baja is a place that
defies imagination.</i>

05:19.778 --> 05:21.279
Baja is an adventure.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.572
It's got a green
flag, a start line,

05:22.739 --> 05:24.323
checkered flag, and a finish.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.327
Everything in between
is a crapshoot.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.078
The only thing you
can describe Baja as

05:29.246 --> 05:31.331
is it's just like life,
you got your ups and downs,

05:31.498 --> 05:34.626
you got your highs and
lows, but in the end,

05:34.793 --> 05:36.628
if you work hard enough
you'll always get through it.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.797
Every time you cross the
border, it's a new adventure.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.813
<i>A</i> 1200-kilometer peninsula

05:54.980 --> 05:56.815
<i>right below California,</i>

05:56.982 --> 05:59.901
<i>with a white shark breeding
ground off the Pacific coast,</i>

06:01.778 --> 06:04.655
<i>gray whales coming to
calf in the Sea of Cortez,</i>

06:05.031 --> 06:07.950
<i>Baja is the least-populated
region of Mexico.</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:13.331
<i>The geography ranges from
snow-capped, 10,000-foot peaks</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:17.377
<i>to scorching deserts.</i>

06:17.961 --> 06:21.547
He can realize how
wonderful land is,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.092
nature is, ocean is.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.593
- Hm, mountains.
- And he can realize

06:25.760 --> 06:27.344
when he race in Baja.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.764
It's like the Wild West, it
just kinda opens your eyes.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.891
It's the ultimate
test of man and machine.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.017
It's magic.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.894
It's a great place.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.979
I don't know how
you could beat it.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.773
I love coming down here.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.983
I look forward to
it so much, it's...

06:42.193 --> 06:43.402
I don't know what to say.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.407
<i>For 50 years they've
come to race the Baja,</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:50.034
<i>all joined under
the same big tent.</i>

06:51.912 --> 06:54.080
<i>And they come from
all walks of life.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:57.875
I'm Ryan Penhall, I'm a
heavy equipment operator.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.335
I'm an aerospace manufacturer.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.796
I'm professional skier
and airborne sportsman.

I'm a businessman.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.965
I work for the railroad,
I'm a diesel electrician now,

07:05.050 --> 07:06.468
now that I've retired
from the Marine Corps.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.678
I'm an environmental
contractor for the military.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
I'm a flight paramedic.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.514
P.J. Jones, race driver.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.185
<i>I don't golf, I don't hunt,
I don't fish,</i>

07:15.560 --> 07:16.602
but I race.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.649
<i>Baja is a special place,</i>

07:21.942 --> 07:24.694
<i>and to know Baja
and off-road racing,</i>

07:24.861 --> 07:26.737
<i>you have to know its people.</i>

07:30.617 --> 07:34.621
<i>We began at the traditional
starting line for the 1000,</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:38.333
<i>Ensenada, where, if
you follow the fun,</i>

07:38.500 --> 07:40.960
<i>you'll end up at Papas &</i> Beer,

07:42.045 --> 07:44.547
<i>the city's biggest
nightclub and restaurant,</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:48.467
<i>founded, owned, and
operated by the Ampudias,</i>

07:48.635 --> 07:51.763
<i>who embody a true
Mexican success story</i>

07:51.888 --> 07:53.806
<i>and off-road racing.</i>

07:57.769 --> 08:00.313
<i>Two weeks before the
first race of the season,</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:03.107
<i>the Ampudias are testing
their new class eight truck.</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:09.155
<i>The Ampudias represent two
generations of off-road racing.</i>

08:10.115 --> 08:13.493
<i>Rodrigo Ampudias Sr.
was only eight years old</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:16.912
<i>when he saw the start
of the 1000 in Ensenada.</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:19.749
<i>In the half-century since,</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:21.751
<i>after starting a
small taco stand</i>

08:21.876 --> 08:23.669
<i>that has grown into
the biggest restaurant</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:25.547
<i>and nightclub in Ensenada,</i>

08:26.339 --> 08:29.717
<i>that passion for
off-road racing remains.</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:33.636
We cannot get sleep,

08:33.763 --> 08:35.181
and I almost forget
about my business.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.140
Thinking about racing.

08:38.727 --> 08:43.227
First time we race in Baja,
we saw Baja 500, 1984.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.443
<i>And then in 1990, we got
the first win in that car.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:50.989
First Mexican to win the
Baja 1000 and the Baja 500.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.658
<i>Dana". Rodrigo's racing legacy</i>

08:53.825 --> 08:55.785
<i>has been taken up by his sons.</i>

08:55.952 --> 08:59.538
<i>The eldest, Rodrigo Jr.,
was the first in line.</i>

09:00.331 --> 09:02.374
This was my first
trophy, right here.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.378
In third place in 1600
class, right, San Felipe.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.965
<i>Rodrigo
Jr. now races trucks</i>

09:09.174 --> 09:10.884
<i>professionally in the US.</i>

09:12.510 --> 09:14.553
<i>For the younger
brothers, Aaron and Alan,</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:17.348
<i>they're working their
way up the ladder.</i>

09:17.515 --> 09:20.017
<i>Last year, they were
class 1600 champions,</i>

09:20.185 --> 09:21.936
<i>this year, with
their father's help,</i>

09:22.353 --> 09:24.313
<i>they're in a class eight truck,</i>

09:24.439 --> 09:25.481
<i>but their dream</i>

09:25.607 --> 09:28.192
<i>is to race in the top class,
the trophy truck.</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:30.402
<i>But that would mean
a pretty big</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:33.114
<i>financial commitment
from dear old Dad.</i>

09:33.281 --> 09:35.199
In your mind,
trophy truck's next?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.700
Hopefully. I think.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.163
I don't think so.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.333
<i>The Ampudias have just one</i>

09:44.501 --> 09:47.086
<i>of many race
garages in Ensenada.</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:51.006
<i>There are others, like the
one of Alejandro Bio's family.</i>

09:51.841 --> 09:56.341
<i>His dad Cisco, uncle Ramon,
and grandfather Pancho.</i>

09:56.513 --> 09:58.515
<i>I started from ground up.</i>

09:58.723 --> 09:59.807
I grew up here in Ensenada,

09:59.974 --> 10:02.184
and that was my
dream, being a kid.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.812
Get into the Baja racing.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.271
I work hard for it.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.107
So, I think it keeps us
out of trouble for sure,

10:08.274 --> 10:10.109
- Papa!
- 'Cause that's,

10:10.276 --> 10:13.028
we gotta do good in school,
that was always my dad's rule.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.281
We do good in school,
and we get to race.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.950
Yeah, at the 500, I
raced, and then Monday

10:18.118 --> 10:19.452
I was at school.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.163
<i>Ramon has raced

<i>In 2011, she became the
first Mexican woman ever</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:48.230
<i>to win the Baja 1000 in
jaw-dropping fashion.</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:53.610
I drove for more than 25
hours, I drove the whole race.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.489
- Wow.
- Got first place.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.035
<i>The Bio family,
these guys are incredible.</i>

11:01.202 --> 11:02.870
<i>They're here to win a
championship for themselves,</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.498
and they're asking me, "What
can we do for you, Rob?"

11:05.665 --> 11:07.917
And I'm like, "Nothing,
nothing, I'm tryin' to help you,

11:08.084 --> 11:09.752
I wanna see you win
the championship."

11:09.961 --> 11:12.046
There's a lotta family racers.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.881
I think once it
gets in your blood,

11:14.090 --> 11:17.009
and you come down here and
you just keep comin' back.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.011
<i>And then everybody's a family</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:21.764
<i>within the whole
racing community.</i>

11:22.098 --> 11:25.726
<i>This is</i> a <i>family
that loves to do crazy things.</i>

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
We're all racing
the same thing.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.011
We're all racing Baja.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.314
<i>San Felipe is the
first of four events</i>

12:11.481 --> 12:12.899
<i>that make up the SCORE</i>

12:13.024 --> 12:15.317
<i>World Desert Championship
racing season.</i>

12:17.111 --> 12:19.530
<i>At dawn, the season begins</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:22.491
<i>with the first
motorcycle off the line.</i>

12:32.835 --> 12:35.003
<i>It's a race against the clock.</i>

12:35.171 --> 12:38.007
<i>250 punishing miles,</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:41.719
<i>each one more surreal
than the last.</i>

12:46.516 --> 12:49.644
<i>It's a race that
runs on pure passion.</i>

12:51.354 --> 12:53.856
<i>The fans don't pay admission.</i>

12:57.694 --> 13:00.822
<i>The pit crews, all volunteers.</i>

13:01.864 --> 13:05.367
<i>For some, the day would end
in victory in their classes,</i>

13:05.660 --> 13:09.664
<i>like the team of Javier Robles
and Josh Rowe on a pro quad.</i>

13:10.832 --> 13:13.376
<i>The Ampudias would
win in their debut</i>

13:13.543 --> 13:14.961
<i>in the class eight truck.</i>

13:16.671 --> 13:19.006
<i>For 17-year-old Ramon Bio,</i>

13:19.215 --> 13:22.968
<i>it was a hard-fought seventh
place in the class 1600.</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:27.014
<i>There are over two dozen
different classes of vehicles,</i>

13:28.057 --> 13:32.061
<i>but one stands above the
rest, the trophy truck.</i>

13:34.314 --> 13:36.691
The most expensive,

13:36.899 --> 13:38.942
<i>the fastest, and
a virtual magnet</i>

13:39.235 --> 13:42.196
<i>for the best drivers
from all over the world.</i>

13:42.447 --> 13:45.074
You see trophy trucks
goin' from having

13:45.241 --> 13:49.245
five to six in the
late 90s, early 2000s,

13:49.412 --> 13:51.080
to now we're racing against 35,

13:51.247 --> 13:53.332
40 trophy trucks
at the Baja 1000.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.378
<i>No Mexican
racer is more popular</i>

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
than Tavo \/ildosola.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.092
<i>He and his father Gus
are folk heroes in</i> Baja.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.386
For us, it's our hobby.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.221
<i>It's a very serious
hobby, obviously,</i>

14:07.347 --> 14:10.475
<i>we spend a lot of money, a lot of time,
a lot of effort into it.</i>

14:11.142 --> 14:13.561
But I don't do this,
this is not my job.

14:13.728 --> 14:14.937
This is what I do for fun.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.147
<i>You've got guys
like Rob MacCachren</i>

14:17.315 --> 14:21.110
<i>and BJ Baldwin and Lalo and
Apdaly, this is what they do.</i>

14:22.695 --> 14:25.406
<i>Apdaly Lopez is
the first Mexican ever</i>

14:25.615 --> 14:28.784
<i>to win the trophy truck
season championship.</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:51.306
At San
Felipe, Apdaly <i>Lopez</i>

14:51.474 --> 14:53.726
<i>would finish third
in the trophy trucks.</i>

14:56.104 --> 14:58.773
<i>Tavo Vildosola
would not finish.</i>

14:58.940 --> 14:59.941
<i>His truck would break,</i>

15:00.983 --> 15:04.111
<i>as would half of all
the trophy trucks in the field.</i>

15:05.363 --> 15:07.073
You got your days
when you'll win races

15:07.240 --> 15:09.533
without even tryin', and
then you'll have days

15:09.742 --> 15:13.537
where it was just
war for eight hours

15:13.704 --> 15:16.123
and then a $3 bolt breaks.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.336
<i>For the
first 2/3 of the race,</i>

15:20.503 --> 15:23.547
Cameron Steele, from San
Clemente, California,

15:23.714 --> 15:26.007
<i>was having a mistake-free day.</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:29.094
<i>And</i> then... the <i>$3</i> bolt.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.350
Things were goin'
pretty smooth,

15:35.518 --> 15:38.812
I think we won the race
through race mile 174,

15:39.856 --> 15:42.400
but I don't know, somethin'
happened to the steering,

15:42.567 --> 15:45.319
and we stopped to
fix the steering

15:45.486 --> 15:47.863
and found a housing was broken,

15:48.156 --> 15:51.617
so we're gonna pack it
up, Baja wins again.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.661
This isn't the first time
we've been leadin' the race

15:54.829 --> 15:57.748
at race mile 175, at
the same stupid turn.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.461
It's heartbreaking.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.174
Makes you just wanna sell
all this shit and give it up.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.467
Just"

16:11.304 --> 16:13.764
I don't know,
chasing your tail is no fun.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.645
<i>Cameron
Steele makes his living</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:22.815
off-road racing, but
not as a competitor.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.234
<i>He owns his own video
production company</i>

16:25.401 --> 16:27.236
and is a <i>TV</i> commentator.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.031
<i>On race weekends, you'll
find him working both jobs.</i>

16:31.949 --> 16:33.992
Some of us have two jobs.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.453
Have to race and commentate.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.372
It's how we pay the
bills around here.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.541
Some of us aren't
independently wealthy.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.418
Most people think
that I'm addicted

16:43.586 --> 16:45.796
to the racing, but
that's not really true.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.091
<i>There was a point last year
where I was just thinkin' about quitting.</i>

16:49.258 --> 16:50.550
Because I was just over it,

16:50.718 --> 16:53.387
and the truth is that the
racing isn't my crack.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.973
Baja is what I'm a junkie for.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.059
<i>Cameron was more
or less raised in Baja,</i>

16:59.268 --> 17:00.727
<i>following his
father's footsteps,</i>

17:00.895 --> 17:03.272
<i>Mark Steele, a famous racer.</i>

17:03.689 --> 17:06.108
<i>It's a passion that has
spread to his own family.</i>

17:06.483 --> 17:09.944
<i>His wife Heidi races as well,
and their daughter,</i>

17:10.112 --> 17:13.031
<i>Cameron Kay,
may be the next in line.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:15.742
- Steer it, come on sweetie.
- Mash the pedal.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.036
Hey, what's up,
this is number 16.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.664
Baja is our <i>life.</i>

17:21.207 --> 17:25.085
There's somethin' about
making the start of the race.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.753
Getting the sponsors in line,

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
getting your
volunteers together,

17:30.132 --> 17:32.217
robbin' Peter to pay Paul,

17:33.094 --> 17:35.262
people maxin' out the
credit cards to get there,

17:35.346 --> 17:36.347
whatever it takes.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.308
<i>Whatever
it takes describes</i>

17:39.433 --> 17:41.726
<i>Cameron Steele
and Billy Wilson.</i>

17:43.145 --> 17:46.189
<i>Billy had traveled from
Corpus Christi, Texas,</i>

17:46.357 --> 17:48.484
<i>his hometown, to race
for the first time</i>

17:48.651 --> 17:50.361
<i>in the trophy truck division.</i>

17:51.320 --> 17:53.155
<i>He'd taken over the
lead from Cameron,</i>

17:54.490 --> 17:56.783
<i>and against all
odds and obstacles,</i>

17:56.909 --> 17:59.328
<i>he crossed the finish
line in first place,</i>

17:59.495 --> 18:01.955
<i>the winner of the
San Felipe 250.</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:03.540
We got
<i>Will Bill</i> in the house,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.835
<i>this is your first trophy
truck across the line.</i>

18:09.005 --> 18:11.298
It's crazy, you've got
all these huge teams,

18:11.465 --> 18:13.675
you feel like you're
just like a little fish

18:13.884 --> 18:16.469
and you might have
a chance, you know?

18:17.054 --> 18:19.056
Every now and then I
guess it comes through.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.019
<i>Another racer
making his class debut,</i>

18:24.228 --> 18:27.147
<i>and coming across the finish
line first, was Carlin Dunne.</i>

18:27.982 --> 18:30.025
<i>Carlin knows
how to ride a bike.</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:33.278
<i>He and his dad own a motorcycle
shop in Santa Barbara,</i>

18:33.446 --> 18:36.907
<i>and Carlin has raced superbike,
flat track, speedway,</i>

18:37.074 --> 18:39.826
<i>and has won the legendary
Pike's Peak Hill Climb</i>

18:40.077 --> 18:42.871
<i>three times, including
setting the record</i>

18:43.039 --> 18:45.082
<i>for fastest time on two wheels.</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:48.376
<i>It's total opposite ends</i>

18:48.502 --> 18:49.586
<i>of the spectrum, you know?</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:52.672
In Mexico you're on
the desert valley floor

18:52.840 --> 18:54.466
for thousands of miles.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.843
<i>At Pike's Peak,
you're at 14,000 feet</i>

18:57.011 --> 18:58.345
<i>for only a matter of minutes.</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:01.681
<i>But the level of focus
remains the same.</i>

19:01.849 --> 19:03.016
Pike's is quick,

19:03.225 --> 19:05.143
but consequences are
extremely severe.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.647
Baja's long, consequences
are extremely severe.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.691
<i>Dana". For Carlin,
competing in Baja</i>

19:10.941 --> 19:12.776
is a serious proposition.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.779
<i>He's racing in
the lronman class.</i>

19:17.365 --> 19:20.076
<i>The lronman, one racer,</i>

19:20.284 --> 19:23.328
one motorcycle the entire race.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.123
<i>It's a unique group
of individuals.</i>

19:27.249 --> 19:29.709
<i>Jeff Benrud former Delta Force.</i>

19:29.877 --> 19:33.422
<i>Michael Skurkis, his
first time racing in</i> Baja.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.383
<i>23-year-old Derek Ausserbauer,</i>

19:36.550 --> 19:39.219
<i>and the defending
lronman champion,</i>

19:39.387 --> 19:41.514
<i>21-year-old Tony</i> Gera,

19:41.639 --> 19:44.475
a <i>diesel engine mechanic
from Santa Cruz, California.</i>

19:44.642 --> 19:46.435
I don't have any
workout routine, nothin'.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.853
I'm always workin' and
by the time I get home,

19:48.979 --> 19:51.606
it's time to go to bed, 'cause I gotta
get up at four o'clock in the morning.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.442
<i>When Carlin
arrived in San Felipe</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:56.570
<i>he knew the man to
beat was Tony Gera.</i>

19:56.737 --> 19:58.613
<i>He just didn't know
what he looked like.</i>

19:58.781 --> 20:00.491
I heard people sayin',
Tony this, Tony that,

20:00.658 --> 20:02.326
he's the champion
guy, this and that,

20:02.451 --> 20:03.618
and then there was
another guy there

20:03.744 --> 20:05.036
who was on this
really sweet-lookin',

20:05.162 --> 20:07.122
brand-new 2016
bike, all the gear,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.374
I'm like, that must be Tony.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.335
<i>I realized Tony was on the bike
that was older than he was.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:14.129
Tony Gera on that

20:14.296 --> 20:17.173
two-stroke 500 Kawasaki smoker.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.052
At San Felipe,

20:20.302 --> 20:22.429
<i>Carlin would cross
the finish line first.</i>

20:22.680 --> 20:26.100
<i>He'd get the medal, and the
champagne for being a winner,</i>

20:26.559 --> 20:28.227
<i>but after they checked
his transponder,</i>

20:28.477 --> 20:31.897
<i>he'd be penalized for missing
five virtual checkpoints,</i>

20:31.981 --> 20:34.733
<i>and Tony Gera would be
awarded the victory.</i>

20:37.403 --> 20:39.279
I called my mom, said,

20:39.864 --> 20:41.156
"Hey Mom, how's it goin'?"

20:41.407 --> 20:44.368
She goes, "lt's goin'
good, I'm sorry you lost."

20:44.535 --> 20:46.161
And I'm like, "No,
Mom, no, no, no.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.580
I won, didn't you
see it, I won."

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
And she goes, "No you didn't."

20:51.125 --> 20:52.251
I went, "What do you mean?"

20:52.418 --> 20:54.044
She goes, "Nah, you
missed the checkpoint.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.795
They said you cheated."

20:55.963 --> 20:57.673
I'm like, "Mom, I didn't cheat.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.091
I got lost."

20:59.467 --> 21:01.302
I better do my
homework next time.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.306
<i>Dana". For any
person on a motorcycle</i>

21:05.431 --> 21:07.724
<i>doing their homework,
you'd study one man.</i>

21:07.892 --> 21:10.519
<i>Colton Udall on the 1X bike.</i>

21:12.438 --> 21:14.440
<i>Colton has been a
dominant rider in Baja</i>

21:14.607 --> 21:16.400
<i>for the last five years,</i>

21:16.609 --> 21:19.945
<i>over which time
he has racked up 11 SCORE wins.</i>

21:20.905 --> 21:22.698
Colton does not ride alone.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.575
<i>He has a team, Ox Motorsports,</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:28.203
<i>which includes his
partner Mark Samuels</i>

21:28.454 --> 21:30.289
<i>and his younger
brother Ian Young.</i>

21:32.750 --> 21:35.210
<i>They are the dominant team.</i>

21:36.504 --> 21:38.631
<i>They even breeze
through Matomi Wash,</i>

21:38.756 --> 21:41.550
and nobody breezes
through Matomi Wash.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.094
<i>It's a place you'll
find top rock crawlers</i>

21:44.178 --> 21:45.929
<i>volunteering as
tow truck drivers,</i>

21:46.138 --> 21:47.806
<i>and they get a lot of action.</i>

22:52.538 --> 22:55.374
<i>Ironically, the most-suited
four-wheeled vehicle</i>

22:55.499 --> 22:58.585
<i>to go through the wash
in class 11 Volkswagen.</i>

22:59.086 --> 23:01.797
<i>A pre-1977 stock Bug
which has been part</i>

23:02.172 --> 23:04.299
which has been <i>part</i>
of the Baja experience

23:04.425 --> 23:05.926
<i>for the last 50 years.</i>

23:06.844 --> 23:09.346
<i>Driving this one is
Dennis Hollenbeck.</i>

23:10.389 --> 23:13.100
<i>This is our beloved
class that we like it this way,</i>

23:13.267 --> 23:15.269
<i>we like old drum/disc,</i>

23:15.477 --> 23:18.730
<i>and we like rattly
steering boxes</i>

23:18.939 --> 23:21.483
and that's why I chose class 11.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.988
Because you're takin'
an impossible vehicle

23:26.780 --> 23:29.365
and drivin' in an
impossible race.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.744
<i>Dana". Dennis is all
about what's possible.</i>

23:33.621 --> 23:36.915
<i>He's a missionary, and his
VW's nickname is Bochito,</i>

23:37.082 --> 23:40.085
<i>and Bochito lives
at Casa Esperanza,</i>

23:40.210 --> 23:42.295
where he gives the kids
that live there a ride.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.529
We like to say that...

24:08.238 --> 24:09.989
<i>it's not all about racing.</i>

24:10.449 --> 24:12.909
<i>There's real lives
that are surrounding</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:15.537
<i>the race community
in what's happening.</i>

24:16.455 --> 24:19.332
<i>We're tryin' to find a
way to take our passion</i>

24:19.625 --> 24:21.460
and our love for racing

24:22.586 --> 24:25.338
and turn it into a way
where we can benefit others.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.809
<i>Mi Casa Esperanza,
My House of Hope,</i>

24:37.184 --> 24:40.061
is a shelter for
battered, abused women.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.898
Some very sad stories come here.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.193
<i>It's a place where moms can
come with their children,</i>

24:47.486 --> 24:49.946
<i>and Casa helps them
in rehabilitation</i>

24:50.114 --> 24:52.908
<i>so they can eventually walk
out with their children,</i>

24:53.409 --> 24:56.662
<i>ready to take care of
them and provide for them.</i>

25:02.960 --> 25:04.544
My mom got pregnant,

25:04.712 --> 25:06.338
so she didn't wanna...

25:06.463 --> 25:10.963
She couldn't work and be
pregnant at the same time, so,

25:11.552 --> 25:15.597
this was a place that
I can go to school,

25:15.764 --> 25:17.557
and they were gonna
help me with that,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.810
and my mom can
just have the baby

25:19.977 --> 25:22.104
and they were just
gonna help us,

25:22.312 --> 25:24.605
because we were alone, it
was just me and my mom.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.359
<i>For the kids
at Casa Esperanza,</i>

25:27.568 --> 25:30.612
<i>Bochito is a living,
breathing friend.</i>

25:30.779 --> 25:33.114
<i>When the Bug comes,
sometimes they kiss it,</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:35.575
and they just love Bochito,

25:35.743 --> 25:37.828
it's like somebody
else for them.

25:38.162 --> 25:41.623
They like it a lot more
than they like me.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.294
<i>When I'm here working, and
the kids are in the classroom,</i>

25:45.461 --> 25:47.713
<i>they literally pop their
heads out the window</i>

25:47.796 --> 25:50.423
and open the door
and start waving, and it's not

25:50.549 --> 25:51.758
Dennis,

25:51.842 --> 25:56.342
they're all going, "Bochito,
where's Bochito?"

25:57.556 --> 26:00.350
<i>Bochito,
Bochito, Bochito,</i>

26:00.517 --> 26:04.270
<i>Bochito, Bochito!</i>

26:04.688 --> 26:07.857
Before every race,
the kids at <i>Casa</i> Esperanza

26:07.983 --> 26:10.276
<i>put their imprint on Bochito.</i>

26:36.053 --> 26:39.765
The handprints, for us,
it symbolizes them pushing,

26:40.224 --> 26:41.808
it's them pushing us along,

26:42.309 --> 26:43.310
'cause they're our motivation.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.622
<i>The first time we did
the San Felipe 250,</i>

27:04.790 --> 27:06.875
<i>our first trophy, and
we took that trophy</i>

27:07.000 --> 27:08.918
back to the kids
at Casa Esperanza.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.129
And it was just
it was magical.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.215
Just magical what it does
and what it says to them.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.385
And you hand it to
them and they hold it.

27:17.553 --> 27:21.014
And, I don't know...
it's just awesome.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.526
You know the story
of David and Goliath.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.028
That's our stone.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.033
And out there is our giant.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.633
For the 500, Baja
was <i>never</i> more a giant.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.887
<i>The peninsula was in the
middle of a heat wave.</i>

28:01.096 --> 28:02.764
<i>At nine o'clock in the morning,</i>

28:02.890 --> 28:05.559
<i>it</i> was 100 degrees
in San Felipe.

28:05.976 --> 28:09.521
<i>By</i> noon, <i>it</i> was 130
on the desert floor.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.404
<i>It was brutal for everyone,</i>

28:17.487 --> 28:18.905
<i>but for those in
trucks and buggies,</i>

28:19.156 --> 28:21.741
<i>at least they had some shade.</i>

28:23.160 --> 28:26.538
<i>Imagine what it was like to
be fully exposed to the sun.</i>

28:32.294 --> 28:34.337
<i>Just past noon, Carlin Dunne,</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:36.589
<i>leading in the
Iron Man division,</i>

28:36.757 --> 28:38.049
<i>would pull into his pits.</i>

28:42.804 --> 28:44.263
How's the bike?
The bike's good?

28:44.431 --> 28:45.682
Yeah, the bike's good.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.851
- You're awesome.
- You've got a huge lead.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.019
I don't think so,
I think the KCM guy's right behind me.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.271
- No.
- I need to cool down,

28:51.438 --> 28:52.564
- seriously, guys.
- Coat it in water.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.440
We're gonna spray your
head down and cool you down.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.775
- Cool my core temperature.
- Yeah.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.610
Yeah, that's
why we're doin' this.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.988
Yeah, before he leaves,
get his whole jersey super wet.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.697
It'll be like an
air conditioner.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.200
Yeah, you'll be
glad you took this break.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.661
<i>Dana". While Carlin
was in his pit,</i>

29:06.745 --> 29:08.496
<i>Ian Young would
come across a rider</i>

29:08.705 --> 29:10.206
<i>who'd fallen in the heat.</i>

29:10.415 --> 29:14.915
Hey, amigo!

29:20.467 --> 29:21.676
Go!

29:21.760 --> 29:22.761
Go!

29:56.753 --> 29:58.546
All right, so time
to gear up if you can.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.012
I think he's askin'
himself, what am I doing?

30:06.179 --> 30:08.139
It's like, why am I doing this?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.398
<i>Dana". At 1:30 p.m.
Derek Ausserbauer</i>

30:17.566 --> 30:19.276
<i>would pull into the Baja pits.</i>

30:19.443 --> 30:21.278
<i>Derek". Baja pits guys,
he was tellin' me</i>

30:21.403 --> 30:23.530
that one of the 6X
riders had passed.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.783
And that scared me pretty bad.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.576
One of my good buddies
was on that team.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.746
- Yeah, hit the gas.
- You got it.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.498
<i>It's kinda hard
to talk about that,</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:35.375
you're pretty much just
riding with this thought

30:35.542 --> 30:38.545
that there's devils comin'
for you in every hole,

30:38.712 --> 30:41.673
so you kinda just survive
at that point, almost.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.802
Comin'
around the finish line,

30:45.886 --> 30:49.639
<i>here he is, the overall winner here
at the Baja 500, Colton Udall.</i>

30:49.723 --> 30:50.849
<i>It has been a hot day,</i>

30:51.016 --> 30:54.227
<i>the hottest race we
have had in decades.</i>

30:56.563 --> 30:57.605
<i>The top four-wheel vehicles</i>

30:57.773 --> 30:59.024
<i>are makin' their
way into town here.</i>

30:59.191 --> 31:01.693
<i>This is the closest
three-way race we've ever had</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:04.070
<i>in the history of
trophy trucks.</i>

31:04.321 --> 31:07.073
<i>Who's it gonna be
comin' around that last turn?</i>

31:07.240 --> 31:09.659
<i>Here he is, this
is Rob MacCachren.</i>

31:10.744 --> 31:13.913
<i>Rounding that last
corner, Apdaly Lopez.</i>

31:15.999 --> 31:18.126
Tavo \/ildosola
taking one home for

31:18.251 --> 31:20.544
<i>that Mexican team
of locals here,</i>

31:20.712 --> 31:22.046
congratulations to the whole...

31:27.052 --> 31:29.637
<i>While Tavo was
standing on the victory stand,</i>

31:29.721 --> 31:31.389
<i>Carlin was coming up the wash,</i>

31:31.556 --> 31:35.184
two hours and <i>45</i> minutes
ahead of the next Ironman.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.234
<i>For the winners, it
was not a joyous day.</i>

31:43.443 --> 31:45.736
Off-road racing is a family.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.655
These guys are hardcore.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.075
<i>I'll tell you what, Baja,
you're already in history,</i>

31:50.242 --> 31:53.954
a <i>testament to how hardcore
these guys are, mere mortals.</i>

31:57.999 --> 32:00.376
<i>Two competitors
died that day.</i>

32:00.585 --> 32:03.629
<i>The 6X motorcycle of
Travis Livingston,</i>

32:04.464 --> 32:08.964
<i>and 232)(, also on</i> a
<i>motorcycle, Noah Everman.</i>

32:09.970 --> 32:11.930
Got <i>up</i>
over 130 degrees <i>here,</i>

32:12.097 --> 32:14.641
<i>but these guys could
come around, and lronman,</i>

32:14.808 --> 32:16.935
<i>and that's what it's all
about down here in</i> Baja.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.312
<i>That's your overall
winner by two hours,</i>

32:19.479 --> 32:20.897
<i>it looks on the job on time.</i>

32:21.064 --> 32:24.108
<i>Carlin Dunne, gets it done,
and congratulations.</i>

32:31.408 --> 32:35.286
<i>Often, it's not
a race, it's not a test,</i>

32:36.246 --> 32:37.789
<i>it's not an adventure,</i>

32:38.165 --> 32:40.333
<i>it's life and it's death.</i>

32:40.625 --> 32:41.834
<i>And like anything</i> else,

32:42.043 --> 32:44.003
<i>there's a choice
in how you're gonna live.</i>

32:46.047 --> 32:48.090
<i>There are only so
many tomorrows,</i>

32:48.258 --> 32:50.802
<i>and it's just a matter of
how you wanna spend them.</i>

32:55.307 --> 32:57.475
Here we are
in beautiful Rosarito.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.602
<i>And when it
comes to racing Baja,</i>

32:59.936 --> 33:01.938
<i>most choose to return.</i>

33:02.314 --> 33:03.898
<i>No better example than that,</i>

33:04.065 --> 33:07.068
<i>than the Price family
from Fremont, California.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:09.612
People ask me a
lot, why do I do this?

33:09.738 --> 33:11.197
Why, you know, why, why, why?

33:13.366 --> 33:15.368
Getting everyone
together as a team,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.454
and for us working on the car.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.957
My kids, my daughters are a
very, very big part of the team.

33:25.295 --> 33:26.379
We...

33:32.093 --> 33:33.552
just wish my mother was here.

33:37.599 --> 33:42.099
We... my kids, just they're
a big, big part of it.

33:43.313 --> 33:47.567
My wife helping with everything,
my friends, my family,

33:48.401 --> 33:50.194
it's a big deal for
us to come here.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.616
We travel a long ways,
we do it as a team,

33:54.783 --> 33:56.910
we've gone through the best what

33:57.077 --> 33:59.496
Baja has to give, and the worst.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.123
And we're still here.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.334
<i>Roger". It's such a unique
experience that families</i>

34:05.627 --> 34:07.629
can actually enjoy
this kind of racing,

34:07.796 --> 34:10.632
and be able to come down
and participate and win.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.300
That's just somethin'
that sucks you in,

34:12.467 --> 34:14.844
and it captivates you,
and then once you're in,

34:15.011 --> 34:16.178
it's really hard to get out.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.554
Out here, it's like really a,

34:17.722 --> 34:21.516
seriously I can really
hear the voice of God.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.396
Mark Winkelman

34:25.480 --> 34:28.483
<i>is a highly successful
businessman from Louisiana.</i>

34:28.650 --> 34:30.693
<i>He decided to start
racing on a motorcycle</i>

34:30.860 --> 34:33.821
<i>in the Baja after
his 47th birthday.</i>

34:33.989 --> 34:36.449
He sponsors two
teams, including one

34:36.533 --> 34:38.868
<i>comprised of some Baja legends.</i>

34:39.869 --> 34:43.539
<i>From stuntman Louis
Franco to Jeff Kaplan,</i>

34:43.706 --> 34:46.208
<i>to 16-time winner Jim O'Neal.</i>

34:47.752 --> 34:50.504
I've done my best stunts in
the world out here for free.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.757
I mean, I've been medevacked
out of here twice,

34:53.925 --> 34:57.345
broke my back, my arms,
legs multiple concussions,

34:57.512 --> 35:00.973
but that's what I love to do,
I love racing motorcycles,

35:01.141 --> 35:02.475
and the good thing about this is

35:02.642 --> 35:04.018
you never know when
it's gonna happen.

35:04.185 --> 35:07.688
There's five collarbones on
this side, one on that side.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.858
I've been lucky, never
broke a femur.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.694
You have to be dumb
enough to do this,

35:12.861 --> 35:14.404
but smart enough
to figure it out.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.031
So, it takes a certain person
to be good at it down here.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.116
<i>One day, it was
like, I was thinkin'</i>

35:19.200 --> 35:20.868
<i>I was a whole bunch
better than I really was.</i>

35:21.036 --> 35:22.954
It was like, okay, like

35:23.121 --> 35:25.289
I'm goin' good, and
I said, oh man, Lord,

35:25.457 --> 35:27.083
what do you want me
to show you today?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.794
And this is what the Lord put in my head,
and the Lord said, "Hey,

35:29.878 --> 35:32.088
Mark, I want you to learn
how to ride better so I don't have to keep

35:32.213 --> 35:34.715
savin' you all the time."

35:34.883 --> 35:36.968
<i>Dana". Mark
Winkelman represents</i>

35:37.218 --> 35:38.886
one end of the
Baja demographic.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.598
<i>On the other end is Chad
Broughton and Paige Sohren.</i>

35:42.724 --> 35:44.517
I know, I did this before.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.811
<i>Dana". Chad and Paige
come from racing families.</i>

35:47.729 --> 35:50.273
<i>Growing up, they competed
against each other,</i>

35:50.732 --> 35:53.901
<i>then raced together,
where romance bloomed.</i>

35:54.152 --> 35:56.529
Yeah, it's
tough comin' to Baja.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.199
<i>Dana". Still, Paige likes
to remind her boyfriend</i>

36:00.325 --> 36:01.993
of the good old days.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.080
We raced class 3000
against each other in 2014,

36:06.456 --> 36:10.418
- and smoked him every time.
- Uh-uh.

36:10.919 --> 36:11.961
Yeah-huh.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.256
- Well...
- True.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.966
Semi-true, we
broke every race,

36:17.133 --> 36:19.510
every single race we broke, didn't finish
a single race the first year--

36:19.636 --> 36:21.220
I was always
ahead when he broke.

36:21.388 --> 36:22.889
That's debatable, but.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.766
<i>They</i> won in San Felipe,

36:24.933 --> 36:27.852
<i>were second in the 500,
and came to Rosarito</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:29.562
<i>leading their class in points.</i>

36:29.729 --> 36:31.814
You know, Baja
has a way of kinda

36:31.981 --> 36:33.607
leveling the playing field.

36:34.150 --> 36:38.237
You can come down here with
all the best intentions

36:38.405 --> 36:40.490
in the world, with the
most expensive equipment,

36:40.657 --> 36:42.241
the best driver, the
whole nine yards,

36:42.409 --> 36:44.869
but that doesn't
guarantee a win down here.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.788
When the flag drops,
the BS stops, you know?

36:47.956 --> 36:49.165
That's what Baja's about.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.627
Well, there is some BS.

36:53.461 --> 36:56.046
<i>To race in SCORE means
racing on ranch roads,</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:59.091
<i>and occasionally the owner
will forget to open the gate.</i>

37:53.396 --> 37:55.731
<i>- X Have taken the crown X

37:57.233 --> 37:59.693
<i>- X Melted it down X

<i>- S Dead and gone S

38:01.613 --> 38:03.531
<i>- X Taken the crown X
- a' Dead and gone a'</i>

38:08.745 --> 38:09.704
It was rough.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.122
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.665
Man, I was eatin' that quad.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.169
For a 64-mile race, this
was a tough one for us.

38:16.336 --> 38:19.005
<i>Dana". Jonathan
Brenthel had a rough day.</i>

38:20.340 --> 38:22.884
<i>He was about 300 yards
from the starting line</i>

38:23.051 --> 38:24.927
<i>when the first bit
of trouble hit.</i>

38:31.059 --> 38:32.226
<i>With the help of the fans,</i>

38:32.352 --> 38:34.103
<i>their truck was put
back on the tires,</i>

38:34.270 --> 38:36.146
<i>and they got back
into the race.</i>

38:38.399 --> 38:40.275
Yeah.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.238
<i>A few miles later,
their hood came halfway off,</i>

38:43.404 --> 38:46.031
<i>and once you've rolled,
you can't see the road,</i>

38:46.199 --> 38:48.576
<i>you're susceptible to a
little bit of tummy trouble.</i>

38:48.743 --> 38:50.119
<i>Yeah, I got</i> a
<i>little sick about--</i>

38:50.411 --> 38:51.620
20 miles--

38:51.788 --> 38:52.914
We had a hell of a day.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.665
Feel a lot better
after you puke,

38:54.749 --> 38:56.292
I can tell you that much.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.501
Where does it go?

38:57.669 --> 39:00.380
- It's all over the car.
- It's in here, it's on my chest,

39:00.505 --> 39:02.256
- on him a little bit.
- Where else would it be?

39:02.382 --> 39:04.425
It's all part of the
off-road racing experience.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.094
<i>Baja is</i> a <i>magnet</i>

39:07.262 --> 39:09.681
<i>for the world's top
extreme athletes.</i>

39:09.848 --> 39:13.309
<i>Like Tyler McQuarrie,
professional sports car driver.</i>

39:14.269 --> 39:18.439
With my experience,
Baja is beyond unique.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.401
Drifting is the
exact opposite of Baja.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.362
In drifting, it's
100% for 30 seconds...

39:26.573 --> 39:28.658
...and in Baja, it all
about just knowing

39:28.825 --> 39:30.284
when to push it and keep it easy

39:30.451 --> 39:31.827
for a very long period of time.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.538
In Australia,
everyone knows Baja

39:34.706 --> 39:35.957
who rides off-road over there.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.584
<i>I broke my collarbone
in the San Felipe 250.</i>

39:38.751 --> 39:40.002
<i>I had to ride 50 miles.</i>

39:40.169 --> 39:42.087
I don't know
how I rode that far with it.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.840
Fresh meat.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.467
I can't wait for him
to be the backseat driver

39:46.634 --> 39:48.135
on the radio for 500 miles.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.553
You're going too fast!

39:49.679 --> 39:51.639
You're going too slow!
Be careful on the rocks!

39:53.308 --> 39:55.810
<i>Possibly the
most extreme athlete</i>

39:55.977 --> 39:58.270
in the world is J.T. Holmes.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.483
<i>He's a skier, a base
jumper, a wingsuiter,</i>

40:02.859 --> 40:04.986
and a Baja racer.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.072
Racing in Baja wins,
it takes the cake.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.408
If you look at, okay, jump
a wingsuit off a mountain,

40:11.576 --> 40:13.286
<i>bombing down a hillside
for a minute and a half,</i>

40:13.453 --> 40:15.455
<i>and that is special stuff.</i>

40:16.706 --> 40:19.792
<i>Ski run, two, three minutes
of fresh tracks, awesome.</i>

40:19.959 --> 40:22.211
<i>Catch a wave, 20
seconds, I'm stoked.</i>

40:23.046 --> 40:26.632
lf you get into the
fire suit, helmet,

40:26.925 --> 40:30.428
<i>co-pilot, GPS, roll
cage, green flag,</i>

40:31.596 --> 40:34.265
<i>500 horsepower, 23
inches of travel?</i>

40:34.432 --> 40:37.351
I mean, you're at wingsuit
speeds for 10 hours.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.479
<i>J.T. was introduced
to Baja by his father,</i>

40:40.647 --> 40:43.650
<i>Jeff Holmes, a surgeon
from Los Gatos, California.</i>

40:43.816 --> 40:46.860
It was in the early 90s,
I would drive Baja Bug,

40:47.028 --> 40:49.739
and I would put J.T. in
the co-driver's seat.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.366
It would be so low,
he could see the dash,

40:52.450 --> 40:53.617
but he couldn't
see out the window,

40:53.785 --> 40:55.036
he couldn't see
out the windshield.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.163
And we put a pillow under him,

40:57.330 --> 40:58.706
and we'd say, "Was that okay?"

40:58.873 --> 40:59.957
"Oh, it's fine, it's fine."

41:00.124 --> 41:01.500
But he couldn't see anything.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.795
And was part of whatever
chase vehicle there was,

41:04.963 --> 41:06.881
and helped out in the pits,

41:07.131 --> 41:09.758
and watched, and
idolized my dad.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.970
<i>They</i> are
both successful men,

41:13.262 --> 41:15.722
<i>and they're bonded
by one place.</i>

41:16.099 --> 41:18.267
What keeps me
comin' back to Baja

41:18.434 --> 41:20.310
is that it's the
ultimate adventure.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.896
<i>And it's time with family.</i>

41:23.147 --> 41:25.983
On this weekend,
for Jeff and J. T. Holmes,

41:26.150 --> 41:28.152
<i>time with family would come</i>

41:28.236 --> 41:30.655
<i>with their first
victory in a SCORE race.</i>

41:32.115 --> 41:34.283
<i>For J.T., it was first place.</i>

41:37.578 --> 41:40.497
<i>For the Price family, they
didn't officially finish,</i>

41:40.665 --> 41:42.958
<i>but it was well
worth the effort.</i>

41:43.209 --> 41:45.002
- Hey.
- Good job!

41:45.461 --> 41:47.087
<i>For Mark Winkelman,</i>

41:47.213 --> 41:49.590
<i>and his crew of
motorcycle Baja legends,</i>

41:49.757 --> 41:52.342
<i>it was first place in
the 50-and-over division.</i>

41:53.553 --> 41:57.807
<i>And for off-roads, Romeo
and Juliet, Chad and Paige,</i>

41:57.974 --> 41:59.642
<i>would come in third
in their class.</i>

42:01.352 --> 42:03.145
<i>For Aaron and Alan Ampudia,</i>

42:03.354 --> 42:05.606
<i>it was their third
consecutive win,</i>

42:05.773 --> 42:08.859
<i>wrapping up the season
class 8 championship.</i>

42:10.445 --> 42:12.905
<i>Meanwhile, Ramon Bios'
second would put him</i>

42:13.072 --> 42:16.075
<i>in first place in
the 1600 class.</i>

42:18.828 --> 42:21.330
<i>All in all, it was
a wonderful race.</i>

42:23.041 --> 42:25.293
<i>Well, maybe not for everyone.</i>

42:26.044 --> 42:27.336
- Oh, yi yi.
- I know.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.589
So, we're gonna
get a little tow,

42:30.840 --> 42:31.924
get outta here,

42:32.967 --> 42:35.427
and go home,

42:36.471 --> 42:38.181
get ready for the Baja 1000.

42:41.100 --> 42:44.853
<i>Dana". In Baja, the 1000
is the event of the year.</i>

42:45.021 --> 42:47.023
<i>The Superbowl,
the World Series,</i>

42:47.231 --> 42:49.733
<i>and Woodstock,
all in one event.</i>

42:50.151 --> 42:52.570
We're
expecting over <i>100,000</i> fans

42:52.737 --> 42:54.947
<i>here at the Baja 1000
this year.</i>

42:55.114 --> 42:58.075
Havin' fun, Baja, this
is where it's all at.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.618
It is gonna be a party,

42:59.744 --> 43:02.872
<i>so stick with us, this is
Contingency for the Baja 1000.</i>

43:03.039 --> 43:04.123
<i>The day before the race,</i>

43:04.373 --> 43:07.084
<i>they have Contingency,
which is kind of a cross</i>

43:07.251 --> 43:10.087
<i>between a safety
inspection and Burning Man.</i>

43:10.421 --> 43:12.589
Been comin' here since '69.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.509
Just gets bigger and bigger
and better and better.

43:16.969 --> 43:20.055
<i>They come from the
world over, and in Ensenada,</i>

43:20.223 --> 43:23.059
the schools have a two-day
holiday for the race.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.061
Hi, sweetie.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.521
So, this is just a stroller?

43:27.647 --> 43:29.482
- Yep.
- Wow.

43:30.525 --> 43:32.443
How much does this
baby stroller cost?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.988
<i>People that race the
Baja are a family,</i>

43:36.239 --> 43:38.449
<i>and no one exemplifies
this more</i>

43:38.616 --> 43:42.286
than Ruben Flores,
aka Calzon Man.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.874
<i>Ruben passes his coloring
books out at Contingency,</i>

43:47.041 --> 43:50.502
<i>and also, when the race isn't
happening, at local schools.</i>

43:53.840 --> 43:57.218
So, work with the kids, and
have 'em teach the adults,

43:57.385 --> 44:00.137
their parents and their
adults how to behave.

44:13.901 --> 44:16.820
<i>Ruben's alternative
identity, Calzon Man,</i>

44:17.071 --> 44:19.323
<i>in English means Underwear Man,</i>

44:19.490 --> 44:22.034
<i>which begs the question, why?</i>

44:22.577 --> 44:24.495
<i>I always wonder if
they weren't embarrassed</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:27.289
<i>by wearing their underwear
of top of their pants.</i>

44:27.456 --> 44:30.250
<i>I always wonder why Superman
wears his underwear on top,</i>

44:30.418 --> 44:33.129
<i>or Batman, so I said, oh
they're always fighting crime,</i>

44:33.254 --> 44:34.338
<i>and they're always in a hurry,</i>

44:34.547 --> 44:37.216
that they go out of
the house so quick

44:37.383 --> 44:40.344
that they forget that their
underwear goes underneath,

44:40.511 --> 44:42.429
not on top of your
pants, so.

44:43.931 --> 44:47.476
<i>This is a family
bonded through the generations</i>

44:47.643 --> 44:51.480
<i>by passion, and
some, by actual DNA,</i>

44:52.023 --> 44:53.315
<i>Like the McMillans.</i>

44:53.482 --> 44:56.359
<i>His grandfather raced,
and their fathers race,</i>

44:56.527 --> 44:59.947
<i>and now, all three cousins,
Dan, Luke, and Andy,</i>

45:00.114 --> 45:02.574
<i>compete against each
other in trophy trucks.</i>

45:04.202 --> 45:06.120
<i>The Johnsons, Ricky and Luke.</i>

45:07.330 --> 45:10.458
<i>The brothers Herbst,
racing legends.</i>

45:10.625 --> 45:14.170
<i>The Wilsons, dad Ronny
and his son Brad.</i>

45:14.337 --> 45:17.048
<i>And the ultimate
example, Rod Hall,</i>

45:17.215 --> 45:19.300
<i>who's never missed
a 1000, and is now</i>

45:19.467 --> 45:21.677
<i>racing with his
granddaughter, Shelby.</i>

45:21.802 --> 45:23.345
I rememberjust drivin' along,

45:23.429 --> 45:25.431
and the sun was coming up,

45:25.598 --> 45:28.350
and it was like my
first experience

45:28.517 --> 45:32.229
of seeing all the cactus
just coming to life

45:32.396 --> 45:34.439
and I thought, "Wow,
this is so amazing.

45:34.690 --> 45:37.693
"Oh God, I gotta pay attention, back
to the road, back to the road."

45:37.818 --> 45:40.862
<i>Well, I'm proud to have
my granddaughter involved.</i>

45:41.239 --> 45:43.241
- Just a great little gal.
- Well, thank you.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.699
And a great driver.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.246
<i>Dana". Another driving legend
of the big racing family,</i>

45:49.413 --> 45:53.542
<i>though not genetically
related, is Eric Solorzano.</i>

45:54.126 --> 45:56.044
<i>In a Tijuana auto garage,</i>

45:56.212 --> 45:58.547
<i>we visited Eric's
family before the race.</i>

46:00.925 --> 46:02.343
What keeps you
guys all coming back?

46:02.468 --> 46:03.510
Pardon me?

46:03.844 --> 46:05.136
What keeps
you guys comin' back?

46:05.263 --> 46:06.681
The passion for Volkswagens.

46:06.806 --> 46:07.890
- Racing?
- Yeah.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.600
- That's what that keeps us...
- Eric, Andy.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.351
- ...together.
- Eric.

46:11.519 --> 46:12.895
- Eric makes us come back.
- And racing.

46:13.062 --> 46:15.105
The racing with Eric is
the best time you could have.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.899
It's the best week of your life.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.234
You know, when
everybody helps,

46:19.694 --> 46:21.570
we're a family,
that's what it is.

46:21.862 --> 46:25.991
That's how we race, because
money, we don't have money.

46:26.325 --> 46:29.161
We have the feeling to race.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.996
It's all that you go through,

46:31.122 --> 46:34.291
and all that people
put together,

46:34.959 --> 46:37.336
before and during the
race, to get there,

46:37.503 --> 46:39.505
to get to the finish
line, to finish,

46:39.588 --> 46:40.922
and carry this thing

46:41.090 --> 46:42.091
across the finish line.

46:43.551 --> 46:46.345
<i>Dana". Somehow, between
that visit and Contingency,</i>

46:46.512 --> 46:49.097
<i>Eric had talked me into being
part of his extended family.</i>

46:50.975 --> 46:53.644
I'm all hired, I
don't know what to say, gee.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.062
We'll have to see
you there, Dana.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.188
All the way.

46:57.898 --> 46:59.316
<i>I would be a first-timer,</i>

46:59.483 --> 47:01.359
<i>just riding shotgun for a bit.</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:04.946
<i>On the complete opposite
end of the spectrum</i>

47:05.156 --> 47:06.615
<i>are the trophy truck racers,</i>

47:06.782 --> 47:09.910
<i>like Billy Wilson
and Apdaly Lopez,</i>

47:10.077 --> 47:12.662
<i>who are battling for
the season championship.</i>

47:13.039 --> 47:14.331
<i>Or Rob MacCachren,</i>

47:14.623 --> 47:18.001
<i>aiming for his third
consecutive win in the 1000.</i>

47:18.169 --> 47:20.921
Baja 1000 is always that race
that you're trying to get won,

47:21.088 --> 47:22.172
it's the biggest
one of the year,

47:22.340 --> 47:24.383
it's the Superbowl, and
if you don't get it done

47:24.550 --> 47:27.177
<i>you gotta wait a full 365
days to get it done again.</i>

47:27.303 --> 47:29.763
<i>So, for me, the planning,
logistics, everything</i>

47:29.847 --> 47:31.473
<i>has been happening
since last year,</i>

47:31.640 --> 47:33.683
when we were here in
the same parking lot.

47:34.018 --> 47:37.312
<i>Rob is a professional
racer with a crew of 70.</i>

47:37.480 --> 47:40.691
<i>Even with his experience,
pre-running is a must,</i>

47:40.858 --> 47:43.694
<i>because every year
they change the course</i>

47:43.861 --> 47:47.656
<i>and figuring out where to go
is like solving a Rubik's Cube.</i>

47:55.456 --> 47:57.458
The one thing I'll tell
ya, is that I didn't realize

47:57.625 --> 47:59.668
the terrain changes,
like, every two miles.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.294
<i>- Yeah.
- It's like rocky,</i>

48:01.462 --> 48:03.505
<i>and then it's sandy, it's silty,
and then you're on a beach,</i>

48:03.589 --> 48:05.173
<i>and then you're
climbin' a mountain,</i>

48:05.341 --> 48:06.842
<i>- it's like, what on Earth?
- Yeah.</i>

48:07.093 --> 48:08.803
<i>Even when you
figure out where to go,</i>

48:08.969 --> 48:11.221
<i>pre-running can be a
little bit dangerous.</i>

48:11.389 --> 48:13.682
And all a sudden, deer,

48:13.849 --> 48:16.142
I mean there was no warning,
no nothin', deer in my lap.

48:16.519 --> 48:18.437
You can see the deer
hair stuck on the...

48:18.604 --> 48:19.980
- Yeah.
- It's still there.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.857
That's unbelievable.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.651
I was thinkin', if it was a little lower
and took out my front wheel,

48:24.819 --> 48:25.986
I would've slapped
down this way.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.279
- Yeah.
- I mean, honestly,

48:27.446 --> 48:29.656
it was the easy way out,
I just exited the bike

48:29.865 --> 48:31.283
with the deer.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.704
The bike went that way,
the deer went that way.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.999
<i>Dana". Pre-running never ends.</i>

48:39.166 --> 48:41.042
<i>For Bob Gordon's son Robby,</i>

48:41.210 --> 48:43.670
<i>and Parnelli Jones' son P.J.,</i>

48:43.838 --> 48:46.882
<i>they have done this
together for 40 years.</i>

48:47.049 --> 48:49.593
<i>Friends since four years
old, P.J. and Robby</i>

48:49.760 --> 48:52.554
<i>have raced Indy,
Daytona, and Le Mans,</i>

48:53.514 --> 48:55.265
<i>but their heart remains here.</i>

48:56.267 --> 48:57.351
<i>It's the unknown.</i>

48:57.518 --> 49:00.103
It's different than,
go to Indy, turn left,

49:00.271 --> 49:02.064
it's the same corner
pretty much every time

49:02.231 --> 49:03.857
<i>unless somebody drops oil.</i>

49:04.024 --> 49:07.569
Here, <i>every</i> corner, you
<i>never</i> know what to expect.

49:07.736 --> 49:09.446
<i>Robby and I
always have said</i>

49:09.613 --> 49:11.448
<i>that if we could've made money,</i>

49:12.283 --> 49:14.702
gotten a paycheck to race these,

49:14.869 --> 49:16.871
we would've never gone
to Indy car and NASCAR,

49:17.037 --> 49:19.456
I mean, this is just the
total, ultimate adventure.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.087
<i>Pre-running
next to P.J. and Robby</i>

49:25.254 --> 49:26.505
<i>were the Ampudias.</i>

49:26.672 --> 49:29.257
<i>He had already won the
season's class 8 championship,</i>

49:30.801 --> 49:33.762
<i>and for the 1000, Aaron
and Alan had convinced</i>

49:33.929 --> 49:37.390
<i>their poor dad to step
up to the ultimate class.</i>

49:37.766 --> 49:38.850
This?

49:38.934 --> 49:40.435
How'd
you end up with that?

49:40.519 --> 49:41.853
Can tell you about these boys.

49:43.439 --> 49:46.650
So, it was kind of spontaneous,
but hey, we're not complaining.

49:48.027 --> 49:48.986
We were stoked.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.279
This is an
addiction, never ends.

49:52.364 --> 49:55.408
<i>To race the Baja
is to tilt at windmills.</i>

49:55.576 --> 49:58.870
<i>Perhaps the best example
of that is Pat O'Keefe.</i>

50:00.331 --> 50:04.043
<i>In February, Pat had
come to San Felipe with his buddy,</i>

50:04.126 --> 50:06.711
<i>Tyler McQuarrie,
in a trophy truck spec.</i>

50:06.837 --> 50:08.713
<i>By the time he got to the 1000,</i>

50:09.006 --> 50:10.882
<i>Pat bought two trophy trucks,</i>

50:11.050 --> 50:14.470
<i>hired two of the best
Baja racers</i> ever,

50:14.720 --> 50:16.888
<i>Larry Roeseler
and Andy McMillan,</i>

50:17.056 --> 50:19.725
<i>and he and Tyler were
pre-running the 1000</i>

50:19.892 --> 50:21.518
<i>for the very first time.</i>

50:22.478 --> 50:25.314
<i>I think we've done about
500 miles so far, pre-running.</i>

50:25.481 --> 50:27.858
Baja has won so far.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.360
Baja one, Tyler zero, for sure.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.487
<i>Tyler and Pat had rolled</i>

50:32.655 --> 50:34.907
<i>their pre-runner
miles from anywhere</i>

50:35.074 --> 50:38.869
<i>when Dennis Hollenbeck
rattled up to give 'em a ride.</i>

50:39.203 --> 50:41.413
We start sharin' with
them, I'm a missionary here,

50:41.580 --> 50:45.250
and we do house building
for the poor and needy,

50:45.417 --> 50:46.793
and we have this
benefit run we do

50:46.961 --> 50:48.754
for Casa Esperanza, bing.

50:48.921 --> 50:50.672
What, what'd you say?

50:51.298 --> 50:52.674
First-class guy, man.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.885
<i>He didn't wait 'til he got
home to go onto GoFundMe.</i>

50:56.053 --> 50:58.013
He took care of it right away,

50:58.180 --> 50:59.806
either whether he was
out pre-running,

50:59.932 --> 51:01.391
or I don't know when.

51:01.934 --> 51:04.353
But I saw him that
afternoon, and by that night,

51:04.520 --> 51:06.522
a donation had already been made

51:07.231 --> 51:09.441
for Casa Esperanza's
school project.

51:10.109 --> 51:14.196
Baja's blessings, you
never know, you never know.

51:16.615 --> 51:18.533
<i>At the time Dennis and Pat</i>

51:18.659 --> 51:22.329
met on Baja's west coast,
just off its east coast,

51:22.538 --> 51:24.706
a <i>group of
war veterans gathered</i>

51:24.832 --> 51:26.959
<i>to honor a
fallen team member.</i>

51:28.252 --> 51:30.796
<i>232X is Warrior Built.</i>

51:30.963 --> 51:33.924
<i>A member of this
team, Noah Everman,</i>

51:34.091 --> 51:35.842
<i>was one of
the two motorcyclists</i>

51:36.010 --> 51:38.303
<i>who died during the Baja 500.</i>

51:40.556 --> 51:44.476
<i>It was not an easy
decision to race the 1000.</i>

51:45.352 --> 51:47.187
It was tough, and there
was moments where I was like,

51:47.354 --> 51:48.229
I don't know if I...

51:48.355 --> 51:49.814
if I should put other
people at risk anymore.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.441
After speaking with his wife,

51:51.609 --> 51:54.153
and some of his good
friends, and these guys here,

51:54.903 --> 51:56.487
<i>we gotta keep movin'
forward, you know?</i>

51:56.655 --> 51:59.240
As combat vets,
we've come to terms with death.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.827
<i>It's part of what we
were and what we are,</i>

52:02.077 --> 52:05.538
and it's with us whether
we're in or out, right now.

52:05.998 --> 52:08.375
It's a brotherhood
of camaraderie

52:08.542 --> 52:10.585
that you feel in
combat to get through

52:10.711 --> 52:12.838
to the next mission, and
it's quite something.

52:13.505 --> 52:14.839
<i>And we're doin' it
for him,</i>

52:15.007 --> 52:16.883
'cause I know he'd
wanna ride here today.

52:17.009 --> 52:19.803
We know he would encourage
us to keep going.

52:20.012 --> 52:21.471
<i>He wouldn't tell us to quit.</i>

52:22.139 --> 52:24.850
<i>They made</i> a
<i>hand-engraved cross</i>

52:25.017 --> 52:27.894
<i>and anchored it in 12
pounds of concrete.</i>

52:41.784 --> 52:45.412
<i>After gathering for a prayer,
they would get in their trucks</i>

52:45.663 --> 52:47.873
<i>and drive into the
mountains three hours</i>

52:48.082 --> 52:52.044
<i>to place Noah's cross at
the exact spot he'd fallen.</i>

53:08.602 --> 53:11.896
<i>There's less than 24
hours before the race,</i>

53:12.189 --> 53:14.733
<i>and high atop Mount Diablo,</i>

53:14.983 --> 53:17.860
<i>Scott Steinberger sets up
the communications relay center.</i>

53:19.863 --> 53:22.490
Weatherman relay,
go ahead SCORE ops.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.953
He's the link
between the drivers,

53:26.161 --> 53:28.997
<i>race operations, and
emergency services.</i>

53:29.206 --> 53:30.457
Loud and clear.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.292
<i>Scott is a former
Baja racer</i>

53:32.418 --> 53:34.294
<i>but not the
original Weatherman,</i>

53:34.378 --> 53:37.464
<i>which was his late
father, Bob Steinberger.</i>

53:38.006 --> 53:40.717
The fact that you
can watch the race

53:40.801 --> 53:42.594
from anywhere you want to,

53:42.845 --> 53:45.013
it's not like a
stateside race at all.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.099
And then anybody'll
tell ya it's the tacos,

53:47.224 --> 53:50.435
and the beer, and
Mexico, it's magic.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.064
<i>15 hours before race time,</i>

53:55.232 --> 53:58.068
<i>Carlin Dunne makes
his final adjustments.</i>

53:59.778 --> 54:02.906
<i>The 500 was so heavy for us.</i>

54:03.073 --> 54:06.534
<i>It kinda changed my whole
perspective on everything, and</i>

54:06.827 --> 54:09.371
it's a little bit excitement,

54:09.997 --> 54:11.707
a little bit adrenaline,

54:12.207 --> 54:14.000
a lot a bit of dread,

54:14.168 --> 54:15.460
'cause you know that

54:15.878 --> 54:17.921
on a certain date,
you're gonna take on

54:18.714 --> 54:20.966
probably the hardest
thing you've ever done.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.306
<i>Buenos (has, Ensenada.</i>

54:28.640 --> 54:29.891
<i>I hope you 9W5"</i>

54:30.142 --> 54:31.476
Just before dawn,

54:31.643 --> 54:34.812
<i>the motorcycles and quads
gather at the starting line.</i>

54:40.569 --> 54:43.488
<i>They</i> leave one at
a <i>time,</i> 30 seconds apart.

54:44.156 --> 54:46.116
<i>It's a race against the clock.</i>

54:46.909 --> 54:49.411
<i>Waiting in the
darkness and cold,</i>

54:49.703 --> 54:52.163
<i>motorcyclists from
Warrior Built</i>

54:53.332 --> 54:54.791
<i>to the lronmen.</i>

54:55.334 --> 54:59.379
<i>Carlin had woken up that
morning with a fever of 101.</i>

55:01.006 --> 55:03.508
<i>Season points leader
Michael Skurkis,</i>

55:03.967 --> 55:06.928
<i>Jeff Benrud, last
year's second place.</i>

55:08.138 --> 55:09.597
- Good morning, Dana.
- Good morning, Rob.

55:09.723 --> 55:13.435
<i>Tony Gera, literally
the toughest man in the world,</i>

55:13.602 --> 55:15.061
<i>and the top professionals,</i>

55:15.229 --> 55:17.522
<i>prohibited favorite
Colton Udall,</i>

55:17.689 --> 55:21.401
two days ago, <i>fell</i> and
shattered his collarbone.

55:21.568 --> 55:22.944
<i>He was taken to the hospital,</i>

55:23.111 --> 55:25.488
<i>where four screws were
put into his collarbone.</i>

55:26.490 --> 55:30.619
<i>Here he is, back in Ensenada
just to start the race.</i>

55:31.286 --> 55:32.870
<i>This is
what it's all about,</i>

55:33.080 --> 55:34.915
<i>it all boils down
to the final race,</i>

55:35.082 --> 55:37.250
<i>the SCORE Baja 1000,
we're just gettin' ready</i>

55:37.376 --> 55:39.044
<i>to kick it off folks,
the two-wheel bikes.</i>

55:39.294 --> 55:40.962
<i>We have Colton Udall, that 1)(,</i>

55:41.213 --> 55:43.048
<i>last year's overall
champion bike</i>

55:43.382 --> 55:45.634
<i>gonna be the first
off the line.</i>

55:56.395 --> 55:58.105
- Go get 'em tiger.
- Thank you.

55:58.272 --> 55:59.564
<i>For the
first time in years,</i>

55:59.731 --> 56:01.774
<i>Colton would get off his bike,</i>

56:01.942 --> 56:04.486
<i>and be the one who would
lend his team support.</i>

56:05.445 --> 56:07.155
People
come from all over the world

56:07.281 --> 56:10.117
<i>to race this, let's give
these riders and drivers each.</i>

56:21.879 --> 56:23.422
<i>Vehicles on the pavement</i>

56:23.547 --> 56:25.131
<i>have to obey the speed limit,</i>

56:25.340 --> 56:26.341
<i>but once you hit the dirt,</i>

56:26.508 --> 56:28.760
<i>it's as fast as you want to go.</i>

57:32.491 --> 57:35.118
<i>There's a three-hour wait
between the last motorcycles</i>

57:35.285 --> 57:37.829
<i>and the first trophy truck
off the starting line.</i>

57:38.330 --> 57:40.290
<i>B.J. Baldwin, gettin' his stretch on.</i>

57:40.457 --> 57:42.917
I'm not calm at all,
I'm actually, like,

57:43.085 --> 57:45.545
I have a lot of anxiety built
up and self-confidence issues

57:45.671 --> 57:48.382
before I get in the truck, and
then once I get in the truck,

57:48.548 --> 57:50.132
<i>I kinda realize
what I'm capable of.</i>

57:50.300 --> 57:52.510
It's only on the
morning of the race.

57:52.678 --> 57:54.680
Every other time, I'm kind
of an asshole about it.

57:54.846 --> 57:57.265
Me too, yeah.

57:59.434 --> 58:01.102
To finish first,
you first must finish,

58:01.269 --> 58:04.522
so that's my goal right
now, got sweaty palms,

58:04.690 --> 58:08.151
I pooped, like, five times,
the adrenaline is hittin' hard.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.028
Don't know if that's too
much information for you,

58:10.153 --> 58:11.988
but I'm ready to go.

58:28.255 --> 58:29.422
And we have some

58:29.631 --> 58:31.633
<i>of the best of the best
here, that's right,</i>

58:31.883 --> 58:34.468
<i>we have over 30 trophy trucks
here and only the best.</i>

58:36.138 --> 58:37.722
<i>See how they do
behind the wheel.</i>

59:03.415 --> 59:05.125
<i>Within the
first four miles,</i>

59:05.375 --> 59:08.795
<i>over 100,000 spectators
will cheer them on.</i>

59:42.370 --> 59:45.456
<i>After the trophy trucks, the
rest of the classes follow.</i>

59:45.791 --> 59:48.043
<i>J.T. Holmes at 11:05.</i>

59:49.044 --> 59:52.380
<i>12:10</i> p.m.,
17-year-old Ramon Bio.

59:54.132 --> 59:58.427
<i>Rod Hall, starting his
49th Baja 1000 effort.</i>

59:59.971 --> 01:00:02.390
<i>And behind the Halls
was the Volkswagen</i>

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.600
of Eric Solorzano and me.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.268
And the class 11s

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.189
<i>are off the line, Eric
Solorzano right there.</i>

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.484
Ready, Dana?

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:13.860
We'll find out.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.745
We were off,

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.832
<i>Eric was ready, I was ready,</i>

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.835
<i>but I was having a little
problem taking it all in.</i>

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.421
- Huh?
- You want some water?

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.798
- Here's water.
- No, I'm lookin' for...

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.593
<i>The air hose in the
helmet had fallen off,</i>

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.303
<i>and I couldn't figure out
how to flip the visor up.</i>

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.973
<i>It was like the freakin'
Amazon in there.</i>

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.600
<i>I couldn't see a thing.</i>

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.946
<i>After five miles, being
the genius that I am,</i>

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:00.448
<i>I finally figured out
how to flip the visor up.</i>

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:05.119
<i>Now that I can see, it's
really starting to set in.</i>

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.081
<i>Just how incredible
this race is,</i>

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.291
<i>and how beautiful the place.</i>

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.586
This is the best
part of this pass, Dan.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.308
<i>Looking from
above, the race is glorious.</i>

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.644
<i>But the closer you
get to the dust,</i>

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.064
<i>it becomes a little
less poetic.</i>

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.450
<i>The dust is an unknown
obstacle in itself,</i>

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.036
but that's just the blanket,
that's just the whitewater

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.538
going over the reef
that you can't even see.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.380
It can be your best friend,
it can be your worst nightmare.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.922
<i>If you're out in front,</i>

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.383
<i>and you're the one
kickin' up the dust,</i>

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.093
<i>like the old Batman days,
put up the smokescreens.</i>

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:29.388
<i>Until you've driven
in somebody's dust</i>

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.392
<i>goin' maybe 80,
100 miles an hour,</i>

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.353
<i>it's like bein' in a snowstorm,
you can't see anything.</i>

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.563
<i>I mean literally, you
can't see the hood.</i>

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.652
<i>Pat". And you're still
goin' on the gas,</i>

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:45.362
and your brain, it
was screaming at you,

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:49.116
slow down, slow down, you
can't see, and you can't.

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:51.786
Because if you do, you'll
never get past that person.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.082
I guess some people see dust

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:58.667
as a distraction,
or as a deterrent.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.880
<i>Dust, to me, is kinda
like red to a bull.</i>

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.382
<i>We're racin' now.</i>

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.051
<i>Dana". The Texan,
Billy Wilson,</i>

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.136
<i>the trophy truck
season's point leader,</i>

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:13.804
<i>was roaring through the dust
when he found a four-foot rock.</i>

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:23.276
<i>Billy was stuck on that
rock for a half an hour.</i>

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.571
<i>Right behind him, Apdaly
Lopez would pass him</i>

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.865
<i>and take over the season's
point championship lead.</i>

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.452
<i>Other vehicles were
having their issues,</i> too.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:37.331
<i>Blinded in the dust, Bochito
ended up right in a ditch.</i>

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.047
Can't see a damn thing.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.842
You break down in SCORE, everybody's
willing to lend a hand and help.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:50.845
<i>Bochito was
only in that ditch</i>

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.098
<i>for about 10 minutes before
the fans helped pull him out.</i>

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:56.851
You can't explain
the environment,

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.645
the feeling that's going on,
how the locals support you.

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:10.114
<i>In Baja, everyone helps.</i>

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.158
<i>It's full participation.</i>

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:18.664
<i>Even our helicopter camera
crew is there to lend a hand.</i>

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.005
<i>Jimmy</i> Cook to the rescue.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.214
Hola.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:31.135
Guys, turn off your fuel pump?

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:32.094
No.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.389
- Yeah, man!
- Whoo!

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:39.227
Hey, be careful
with all that oil comin' out.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.353
Yeah.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.941
I call this a band of brothers.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.943
It's like going to
war in the Baja 1000.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.862
<i>We may be fierce competitors,
but we're like family.</i>

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:57.119
<i>Alan Ampudia,
racing in</i> a <i>trophy truck</i>

01:05:57.245 --> 01:06:00.164
<i>for the first time, was trying
to hold off Cameron Steele</i>

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.999
<i>and going as fast as he could.</i>

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.681
<i>Cameron pulled over his truck,</i>

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:20.059
<i>while his co-driver got out
to see if Alan was</i> okay.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:24.605
<i>Fans appeared from
seemingly nowhere.</i>

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.696
<i>Trophy truck 16, can you
give me the mile marker</i>

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.449
one more time, and
is everybody okay?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:39.162
<i>Race
mile 179 and a half,</i>

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.998
<i>my navigator is not
plugged back in yet.</i>

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.376
<i>Ampudia trophy truck
number 10</i>

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:51.169
had a bad crash at mile 179.5.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.430
<i>After an
eternal five minutes,</i>

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:01.350
<i>Alan Ampudia emerged
from the wreck unscathed.</i>

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.478
<i>His race was over.</i>

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.147
<i>10-four, both
driver and co-driver</i>

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:09.191
<i>got out of the
truck and were</i> okay.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.651
Race 16, we stopped

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.320
and everything looks
good, it's all good.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.489
10-four, thank you Race 16.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.324
Race 16 clear, go get 'em.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.828
<i>Dana". About an hour
after the Ampudia wreck,</i>

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.330
<i>Chad Broughton
and Paige Sohren,</i>

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:27.501
<i>going over 100 miles an
hour outside of Camalu.</i>

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.350
<i>- Weatherman.
- 202, 202 Race,</i>

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:46.854
<i>race mile 173, 33 miles
an hour, too many to go.</i>

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:51.483
202 race, mile
173, not moving.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.457
<i>Incredibly, Paige
and Chad were not hurt.</i>

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:14.757
Driver and co-driver are okay.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.386
Hm.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:19.595
Still goin'.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.555
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.600
<i>More incredibly,
after</i> a <i>mere 90 minutes,</i>

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.894
<i>Chad and Paige
and the spectators</i>

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.854
<i>put the truck back together,</i>

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.982
<i>and they were back in the race.</i>

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.279
<i>At the same time B.J. Baldwin
was arriving in the pits.</i>

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.951
<i>I got out at pit one.</i>

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.245
Yeah, baby.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.456
<i>Dana".
And Eric's crew fueled the car.</i>

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:53.211
Get ready, we're go.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.299
<i>Tony Gera
pulled into the Baja pits</i>

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.011
<i>first place in the
lronman division.</i>

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:07.100
<i>Ten minutes behind Tony,
Carlin Dunne arrived.</i>

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.270
<i>His fever was still rising.</i>

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.189
- Okay.
- Go, go.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.698
<i>For the Warrior Built,</i>

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:25.535
<i>232X was burning
more oil than gas.</i>

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:29.456
<i>It hadn't been touched since
Noah Everman raced the 500.</i>

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.710
<i>Still, they pressed on.</i>

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.633
<i>Now, they not only
race the clock,</i>

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.178
<i>they race the sun.</i>

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:05.034
<i>Most of the Baja 1000
happens in the dark.</i>

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.872
<i>It's a long, surreal
test of man and machine.</i>

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.335
<i>Just after sundown, Ramon Bio,</i>

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:18.380
<i>the high school
senior from Ensenada,</i>

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.216
<i>was having mechanical problems.</i>

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.594
<i>His father, brother,
and friends</i>

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.138
<i>worked feverishly on the car.</i>

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.891
<i>After a bit more than an hour,</i>

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.185
<i>they got Ramon back
in the race.</i>

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.273
<i>Racing at night in the Baja</i>

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.651
<i>is just like racing the day,</i>

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.778
<i>except it's absolutely not.</i>

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.946
<i>Everything looks
different at night.</i>

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.574
The cows on the road
that aren't there,

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.578
the trees that are laying over
in the road that aren't there,

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.372
there's things that are
moving that aren't moving.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.546
<i>Ricky Johnson". You're riding
and you go, oh, oh no,</i>

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.383
<i>there's somebody behind
me, I can feel it.</i>

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.260
<i>And you look black and it's
completely pitch black,</i>

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.804
<i>like there's nobody,
like everyone left</i>

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.723
the face of the Earth and
you're lookin' back there,

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:10.557
and it's like, there's nobody.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:11.767
Then you have this realization,

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.186
if I fall down,
who's gonna find me?

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.454
One of the things that
also at night in Baja,

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.249
you're in the middle of nowhere,
and there's always somebody.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.084
There's always
somebody watching,

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.585
and when you think
that there's not,

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.546
there's just, a campfire.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.061
<i>Dana". Sometimes,
that campfire</i>

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.064
<i>is your family cheering you on,</i>

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:03.861
<i>and sometimes, it's a chase
crew waiting on their rider.</i>

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.741
<i>For Scott Dunlavey, head
mechanic for Carlin Dunne,</i>

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.577
<i>it was a mystery what
happened to their racer.</i>

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.036
It still just
doesn't make sense,

01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:14.830
- three miles out of a pit.
- Yeah.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:17.249
That's what I don't,
that's what's not jivin'.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.543
I don't know, we'll find out.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:22.380
<i>A few hours earlier,</i>

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:25.258
<i>Carlin Dunne saw a
spectator's truck.</i>

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:29.970
<i>His fever spiking,
sweating, chills,</i>

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:32.639
and unable to see
out of one eye,

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.935
he <i>ended</i> his race.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:43.233
10-four, 705X out
of the race at 3:55,

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.069
his chase crews are comin' in.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.450
<i>There's still over
200 vehicles left in this race,</i>

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.995
<i>some with 24 hours
to go to the finish.</i>

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.165
<i>Bochito pulled into his pit</i>

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.418
<i>with more problems
than solutions.</i>

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.176
We'll see how the Bug's doin',

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.178
and keep runnin', we're
doin' this for the children.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.347
They don't give up, the
women don't give up,

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.015
<i>we're gonna give up, either.</i>

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.189
<i>For the Warrior Built,</i>

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:24.900
<i>their bike was still
burning a lot of oil,</i>

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.903
<i>and had 500 miles left to go.</i>

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.451
<i>While others, like the
professional motorcycle racers,</i>

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.370
<i>are entering their last pits.</i>

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:41.875
<i>Including 45)(, with
Shane Esposito,</i>

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:44.336
<i>who is having a
bit of a problem.</i>

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.713
How's it
goin' out there for ya?

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:50.718
I got on, and within
15 miles lost the lights.

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:55.890
What was plan B?

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.144
Start drinkin' beer.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.063
<i>Dana". Through the
fatigue and darkness,</i>

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.023
<i>there's always that smile.</i>

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:09.236
<i>The 1X of Ox Motorsports
pulling in to their final pit.</i>

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.954
- You're the best team!
- You're the best!

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.330
You're the best!

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.211
Ah, it's Stokie's 26th birthday

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.171
on the Baja 1000, November 18th.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:30.674
Who wouldn't wanna be leading
the Baja 1000 on their birthday?

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:32.175
I would.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.065
<i>As the clock reached 11,</i>

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:50.653
<i>the fastest motorcycles were
just outside of Ensenada.</i>

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.989
It has
been a long day here in Baja.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.783
<i>But tell you what, we
are just moments away</i>

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:59.536
<i>from our first bike
coming across the line.</i>

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.538
<i>Make some noise, Ensenada,</i>

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.790
<i>here he is, comin'
around the last corner,</i>

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:06.752
<i>that is Mark Samuels on
that 1X Ox Motorsports.</i>

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.670
<i>First to cross the line</i>

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.882
<i>was the 1)(, Ox Motorsports.</i>

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:15.344
<i>Colton Udall not on board,
but still a victory.</i>

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.306
The second
bike across the line,

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.891
here he comes, another
<i>Ox</i> Motorsports,

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:24.270
<i>back with his black Honda,
that is Ray Del Soglio</i>

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.480
<i>and his team on 3X.</i>

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:30.484
<i>Coming in third was
Shane Esposito on the 45X.</i>

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:32.987
<i>He had a story to
tell about his lights.</i>

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:35.406
And they
taped it to my visor.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.783
It was like this.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.118
And that's what I,

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:43.289
they gave me a roll of
electrical tape, which I have,

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:46.834
and a big pack of D
batteries so if it went dead

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.378
I could change it. So good.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:51.129
<i>Dana". While the
fastest on two wheels</i>

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.590
<i>were at the finish
line, most of the racers</i>

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.634
<i>and vehicles were
still on the course.</i>

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.219
<i>Some taking a break.</i>

01:15:58.429 --> 01:15:59.555
- Hey Jim.
- Hey.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.098
- Open the door.
- No.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.016
Fartee's auto scent.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:07.854
But he won't, come on out.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:10.440
- No.
- Your tank's full, buddy.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.526
<i>Others at</i> a <i>dead stop.</i>

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.069
100 to zero real quick.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.321
I hit a rock the size
of a car, all right?

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.741
All the lights that are smashed
in the chassis still work.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.951
- Smashed in the chassis.
- They're smassed,

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:23.203
shmashed, smashed.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.746
Smashed, inside the chassis.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.373
- Smashed!
- I may have hit my head

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:27.666
a little bit hard.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.086
This is so good.

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.963
I tell you what, you cannot

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.798
prepare yourself for this race.

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.010
Today!

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.513
<i>This race takes
everything you got</i>

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.474
<i>and then some to
make it halfway.</i>

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:47.644
The rest of the way,
you're just insane.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.369
The trophy
trucks are comin' in.

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:47.955
<i>Dana". At 3:15 a.m.
crossing the finish line</i>

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.957
<i>for the third consecutive time</i>

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:53.335
<i>as the fastest vehicle
in the Baja 1000,</i>

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.045
<i>was Rob MacCachren.</i>

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:57.922
<i>Third</i> year in a row,

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.383
<i>let's hear it for
Rob MacCachren.</i>

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.760
Rob has just been on fire

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.511
<i>throughout this season.</i>

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.349
<i>In</i> second
place was Apdaly Lopez.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.851
<i>The pride of Mexicali
had won the season's</i>

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.147
<i>points championship for
the second straight year.</i>

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.024
We <i>have</i> to
build hope so much.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:20.654
This was probably
the toughest Baja 1000

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.323
in the 17 years
I've been racing.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.076
<i>Larry". You never
really conquer Baja,</i>

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:27.411
- I mean.
- Yeah.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:30.830
I've won a few,
and you lose more

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:34.125
than you win, of course, but
when you finish the race,

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.128
it's an accomplishment
of its own.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:38.839
<i>Even for those
that didn't finish,</i>

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:41.758
<i>like Rodrigo Ampudia
Jr., they are there.</i>

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:45.220
It's part of racing, sometimes
it's a learning experience,

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.807
other times it's about
celebrating at the finish line,

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.893
so we're here watching our
friends cross the line.

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:56.106
<i>Dana". Billy Wilson
finished in ninth place</i>

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.900
<i>in the trophy trucks,
three points shy</i>

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.776
<i>of the season championship.</i>

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.863
To finish this race is a feeling

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:07.451
that you don't get
until you do it,

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.828
<i>so we're haPPY-</i>

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.040
<i>As night becomes clay,</i>

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.251
<i>they continue to
cross the line.</i>

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:23.337
There we sat at 4:03,
waitin', and let everybody by.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:27.012
Baja once again.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:28.680
Turn around and
head backwards.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.515
<i>Dana". At dawn,
Cameron Steele,</i>

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:33.310
<i>finishing eighth place
in the trophy trucks.</i>

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:37.272
It was really good
'til about 65 miles ago.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.317
Just feels like...

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.695
Feels like continually
punching yourself in the face.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:46.073
<i>For most
racers, their dream</i>

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.118
<i>of a 1000 championship
would remain unrealized.</i>

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:53.538
<i>But for Ronny
Wilson, who had tried</i>

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:56.792
<i>24 times to win the 1000,</i>

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.169
<i>at 7:05</i> a.m.,

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:02.213
<i>he finally realized his dream.</i>

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.716
24 years.

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.175
<i>I</i> don't know what his

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:08.762
<i>unofficial result time
is, or what his place is,</i>

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:12.766
<i>his unofficial result
is first place.</i>

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:15.685
<i>That's one, you're comin'
over to our division.</i>

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:20.353
<i>That's 1/3 into it, Ronny Wilson,
the unofficial winner of them all,</i>

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:23.277
<i>and this would be his first win in</i> Baja.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:24.653
<i>The whole
Wilson Motorsports team.</i>

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.321
Good things
happen to good people.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:27.489
Sometimes it takes a while.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:28.990
Yeah, I know.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:32.744
Now,
some of the toughest guys--

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:35.247
<i>Dana". Behind Ronny
were the top lronmen.</i>

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:37.791
<i>Jeff Benrud a
close second place.</i>

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:40.877
<i>Michael Skurkis, fifth,</i>

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.879
<i>but winning
the season championship.</i>

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:47.301
<i>And the Baja 1000 lronman
champion, Tony Gera.</i>

01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:50.554
This is
the arena for the gladiators.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:53.807
You see guys still
hangin' it out way farther

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:56.017
than they do anywhere
else in the world,

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:57.769
to get to that finish line.

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:00.021
That finish line
is all-important.

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:08.030
<i>At the dawn of
day two, they race on.</i>

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:49.613
<i>At sunrise, J.T. Holmes was
in first place in his class.</i>

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:52.407
<i>An hour later,</i> a <i>rear CV joint</i>

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.284
<i>would pull him out of the race.</i>

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:58.371
<i>His navigator, Eric Clay,
would stay with the car.</i>

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:01.458
It's been a
crazy day, a couple days.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:05.503
We have been racing for
17 hours and 43 minutes.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:10.092
J.T. left to go hitchhike
a ride into BFG pit.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.886
Yeah, and you never
know with the Baja 1000,

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:15.722
such a long race,
some of the other guys

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:17.974
we're competing
against might also have

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:22.479
a huge problem, or they
may not even finish.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.773
You could win just by finishing.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:25.983
So, you never give up.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.402
And they <i>never</i> give up.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.321
<i>24 hours into the race,</i>

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.740
<i>still pushing towards
the finish line.</i>

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.141
<i>20 miles from the
finish, Wayne Matlock's</i>

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.727
<i>front wheel came off.</i>

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:08.896
<i>But, being a Baja veteran,
Wayne saw an opportunity.</i>

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:17.701
<i>Wayne, a past Baja champ,</i>

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.870
<i>would ride like that
for an hour</i>

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.205
<i>until crossing the finish line</i>

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:25.500
<i>to the loudest standing
ovation he'd ever heard.</i>

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.089
<i>Wayne finished behind
his wife Kristen,</i>

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:32.715
<i>who lronmanned it.</i>

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.219
<i>Warren Jun Tangeron,</i>

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:39.222
<i>from Thailand, pushed
his bike a mile</i>

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:42.975
<i>to cross the finish line,
carrying a framed photograph</i>

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:44.978
<i>of the late King of Thailand.</i>

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:47.647
<i>If you'd have told me
at mile 400 last night</i>

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.692
that I was gonna finish,
I wouldn't have believed ya.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.554
When you get to the finish line

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:21.514
it's a feeling
that you cannot...

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.768
translate, you cannot express.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:28.522
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Whoo!

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:33.484
How was that?

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:34.861
- That was,
- It's awesome.

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:36.696
Unbelievable.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.535
When I was like
mile 700, I was like,

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:44.538
what the hell am I doing, I
could be in my bed right now.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:46.289
I don't know if there's
a word that can say

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.583
love and hate at the same time.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.335
<i>It's just magical.</i>

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.425
<i>17-year-old
Ramon Bio finished</i>

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:00.262
<i>in first place in
the 1600 class,</i>

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.098
<i>which wrapped up the
season championship.</i>

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.976
Overall
points championship.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.061
- Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
- Mark Winkelman,

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.146
<i>Louis Franco, and
the rest of the boys</i>

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.649
<i>from the retirement home
brought home a victory</i>

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:15.693
- in the 50-and-over class.
- That was the roughest one

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:17.028
I've ever done.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.988
<i>Limpin' it in, they
got that thing back together.</i>

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.365
<i>They're not only
taking second place--</i>

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.326
<i>18 hours after
their horrific crash,</i>

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.495
<i>Chad and Paige cross the line,</i>

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:29.040
<i>winning the trophy truck
spec season championship.</i>

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.084
We're not hurt,
truck's not hurt,

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.211
we made it, so
we're the champions.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.171
<i>I've never been a champion.</i>

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:38.466
I would rather have fourth
place with adventure

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.886
than first place
with no adventure.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.221
I think I'd take first place.

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:44.514
What?

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.936
<i>The race continues
as the clock ticks</i> away.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.316
- What are you do now?
- This'll go in the back.

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:59.362
- In here?
- Keep away from that wiring.

01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:01.989
- Where'd you go?
- Hook it on itself.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:34.981
<i>With the sun
setting on the second day,</i>

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:38.276
<i>J.T. Holmes decided
to hang it up.</i>

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:45.491
<i>A few hours later, Dennis
Hollenbeck also made a decision.</i>

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:48.661
So, the decision's been made.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.542
We're at the end of our race.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:06.179
<i>Still, at the finish line,
they cross.</i>

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:10.725
They all think we're nuts,
until they experience it,

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.102
and then they go, "Oh
my God, now I know why

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.854
you guys spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:16.439
and 40 years tryin'
to get one of these

01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:19.191
stupid little pins that
says Winner."

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:22.279
Just
over 40 hours into the race,

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:25.282
<i>and look who's
coming in, an icon,</i>

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:28.951
<i>Rod Hall, he's got his
granddaughter with him, Shelby.</i>

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.128
<i>Dana". Rod Hall was
diagnosed with Parkinson's</i>

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:42.507
<i>two years ago, a
true racing legend.</i>

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:50.765
<i>Over four hours past
their allotted time,</i>

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.935
<i>Warrior Built cross
the finish line.</i>

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.606
Talk about making it.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:04.445
<i>They had done it for</i> Noah.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.908
I got to ride by the
section where he fell today.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.835
<i>Immediately I pulled over
and took my helmet off</i>

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:22.714
and just talked to him, and
made sure that I was gonna

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:25.049
take this bike over the
finish line for him,

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:27.093
and finish the race for him.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:40.440
<i>The official time
is over for all vehicles.</i>

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:45.987
<i>The fans have left, only a
few SCORE officials remain,</i>

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:49.115
<i>but off in the distance,
I can hear the sound</i>

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:50.908
of Eric's Volkswagen.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.388
- Yeah!
- Woo!

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:13.306
It made it, Eric.

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.766
Thank you, Bobby,
and it was great.

01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:17.268
Thank you for
letting me drive.

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:19.061
How is she?

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:23.024
<i>After we got
our picture taken,</i>

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:26.068
<i>Eric drove the race
car back to his house.</i>

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:31.825
<i>Six hours later, out in front</i>

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:34.327
<i>of the convention
hall in Ensenada,</i>

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:36.370
<i>they were taking
down the finish line.</i>

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.708
<i>And then, the last finisher,</i>

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:43.878
<i>after 47 hours, crossed
the finish line.</i>

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.634
Thank you.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:51.886
I came down
here, Roger told me

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.679
there's somebody
comin' in, and I wanted

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.556
to get down here
and see you come in.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:58.059
Oh, we've been fightin'
and the checkpoints closed,

01:29:58.226 --> 01:29:59.560
I said, I don't
care, that's our--

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:01.438
- That's great, that's-
- This is our fourth one

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:02.856
down here and I
haven't finished yet.

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:05.358
All I can say is that's the
Baja spirit all the way.

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:06.860
- I'm not gonna give anyone my keys,
- Dude.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:07.860
I'm gonna keep goin'.

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.695
- Oh, we've had some problems.
- Here you go, for your--

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:10.822
We fought hard.

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:13.240
Oh yeah, well
hey, you know what?

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:14.492
It looks like it.

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:16.702
<i>Levi". As I said, this
is our fourth race.</i>

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.037
We haven't finished
one before this,

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:19.413
and if we did not
finish this one,

01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:21.332
eventhough
technically we didn't,

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.501
we'd still be back next year.

01:30:27.964 --> 01:30:29.966
Some go
home with trophies,

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:33.052
<i>others contemplate
the following season.</i>

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:38.683
<i>And you know, it's
been said before,</i>

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.893
when you start seein'
that checkered flag,

01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:43.063
you don't want it to end,
you wanna keep on goin',

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:46.190
and you just can't
wait for the next race.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:49.360
It's like a bad breakup with
a crazy girlfriend, right?

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.904
Like, little ways down the road,

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:53.156
you remember all the good stuff,

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:55.241
you're like, why did
we break up, anyways?

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:57.076
And you give her a call
and next thing you know,

01:30:57.202 --> 01:30:58.870
your car's gettin'
keyed and tires slashed,

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.580
and you're like, that's why.

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:01.956
Forgot about that.

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:09.171
<i>The racers
return their transponders.</i>

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:12.049
<i>For 36 hours, they
were Superman.</i>

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:15.804
<i>Now, they return
to being everyman.</i>

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.689
<i>She's</i> a <i>jealous woman,</i>

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.608
<i>and she wanted
everything we had.</i>

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.443
<i>She wanted everything,
and she said,</i>

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:33.279
<i>"Not this time, boys,
it ain't gonna happen."</i>

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:35.489
You wanna keep
going and this is,

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.044
part of that struggle
is you wanna keep going,

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:51.672
you wanna finish, at least.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.925
You get to the point where,
forget about the trophy,

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.802
that's gone, that's
gone, if I could just get

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:57.303
to the finish line,
that'll be enough.

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:02.891
<i>It's an amazing thing with
the little kids at</i> Casa.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:05.644
<i>They never ask,
did Bochito win?</i>

01:32:06.396 --> 01:32:09.107
They always ask, how is Bochito?

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:13.027
Okay, this time the Baja won.

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.655
<i>But it's still out there,</i>

01:32:15.822 --> 01:32:18.616
<i>we're still here, and we
still have a group of kids</i>

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:22.787
<i>waitin' for Bochito
to make its return.</i>

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:35.776
Okay.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:55.880
we had 17 guys out there

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:57.673
<i>- and my two kids.
- It's like oh, no,</i>

01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.175
<i>not his wife!</i>

01:33:59.342 --> 01:34:00.968
There's nothing like it.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.137
- Ever.
- That's awesome.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.139
Hi Daddy!

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.016
Hey, come here.

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.100
Hey.

01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:11.646
- Watch the antenna.
- I love you.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:13.147
Atta boy.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.149
Miles from his home, miles.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:18.402
Yay.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.277
Keep yourself up.

01:35:42.862 --> 01:35:44.697
I'm tryin' the best I can.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:51.537
End credits, right here.

01:35:51.704 --> 01:35:53.831
Except we'll cut you
out, you can stay,

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:56.792
you're in, you,
okay, you're back in.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.379
Big guy gotta be in
'cause he'll beat me up.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.266
- Yeah.
- Basically, and now

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:15.185
the same core group, you know,
is gonna analyze this movie.

01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:16.895
Yeah, I...

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.273
It's a piece of cake.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.358
No, no, just do the
same thing you did

01:36:21.526 --> 01:36:24.070
with the first one and
you'll be fine, all of you.

01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:25.821
- But Kevin got so old,
- All of you.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:29.784
I don't know.

01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:31.452
I mean, I'm still
sharp as a tack.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.126
And, action.

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.461
Behind the scenes.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.212
Farther behind the scenes.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.382
- And we will not return.
- And there he is.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.927
- You could do this talking pup.
- Yeah, just put him

01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:49.345
down here in the corner.

01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:51.805
Yeah, just go to the corner.

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.016
Now I'm the throttle hand,

01:36:54.183 --> 01:36:56.059
this guy, nothin'.

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:58.896
They do all the work.

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:01.774
Oh, it looks like one of
those weird kung fu movies.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.198
Tavo Vildosola, good to see you,
thanks for swingin' by.

01:37:09.365 --> 01:37:10.699
You're kind of a
national hero down here.

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:13.578
Yep, I'm runnin' for
President next year.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:15.830
I'm pretty sure I'll win it.

01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:17.832
I'm gonna take down the wall.

01:37:21.627 --> 01:37:23.378
I'm gonna have the
United States pay for it.

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:27.591
This right now is
being shot by my son Wes,

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.510
he's right behind the camera.

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:32.220
I just wanna say,

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.557
I'm basically
savin' this whole film.

01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:36.934
This crew.

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:40.312
And just Mongo
wanted to let you know

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.690
that Mongo is very hungry.

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:46.860
And Mongo is not happy
about not eating.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:51.991
And you look, actually,
this light's so magnificent.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.787
- Um.
- ls this weird?

01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:00.375
Is this uncomfortable
for anybody else?

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.417
This is a plea to the Academy.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:05.713
I don't see any reason to
even have any other nominees,

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.215
so please get that trophy ready.

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:09.634
<i>We'll be at the ceremony,</i>

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:12.219
<i>we're comin' out in 2007,
so 2018 we'll be there.</i>

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:14.806
<i>We want a big table,
all of you gold,</i>

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:16.431
and that goes to
Golden Globers, too.

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:20.185
There he goes, the
man, the myth, the legend.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.651
Help.

01:38:26.818 --> 01:38:28.611
Help, little help here.
