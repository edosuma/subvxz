02:07.961 --> 02:09.293
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.792
- Here's the new dress for Miss Sloper.
- Thank you.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.265
Miss Catherine, it's your new dress.

02:23.352 --> 02:26.265
Oh, will you take it out of the box,
Maria, and hang it up?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.355
Yes, miss.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.691
Well, that's all, I think.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.982
- I'll be at the Harrisons'.
- Yes, Doctor.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.536
I may not get to the clinic today at all.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.157
- Ah, good morning, Lavinia.
- Good morning, Austin.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.334
Is Catherine starting
another of these things?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.332
Yes. She embroiders beautifully.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.960
I hope she doesn't let it
become her life's work.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.714
Austin, yesterday
I had the most exciting experience.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.761
- Oh?
- I met two people from Poughkeepsie.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.135
Oh, birth certificates.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.467
They've been members
of my husband's congregation.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.268
And when I told them I was stopping
with my brother, Dr. Sloper,

03:08.355 --> 03:12.144
at 16 Washington Square,
they were so impressed.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.645
It's just made my visit.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.773
Lavinia, would you care
to spend the winter here?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.571
The winter? Oh, gladly.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.868
Good. I thought if you stayed on,
you might help Catherine.

03:23.954 --> 03:27.573
Help her? But help her how, Austin?

03:27.666 --> 03:30.454
Well, for instance,
at sister Elizabeth's party this evening,

03:30.544 --> 03:33.833
perhaps you could persuade Catherine
to join in freely with the young people.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.622
Enjoy herself.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.673
But, of course, she'll do that.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.759
I hope so.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.594
Ah...

03:46.226 --> 03:48.309
Six pounds. That'll be 30 cents.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.313
Could you please cut off the head?

03:52.399 --> 03:53.399
Uh, yes, miss.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.894
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.656
There you are.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.943
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.240
Fresh fish!

04:03.326 --> 04:05.613
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Catherine.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.991
I bought a fine fish
for the chowder you like.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.492
That's very thoughtful.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.868
Next time,
let the man carry it in for you.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.452
Oh. Yes, Father.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.753
Coming.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.796
It's a lovely morning.

04:17.882 --> 04:21.172
Why don't you invite your Aunt Lavinia
or a friend to take luncheon with you.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.253
Perhaps go to one of the park concerts.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.214
I can't, Father. I have
some embroidery I'd like to attend to.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.549
Ah, yes.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.677
Well, I'll see you this evening.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.478
Yes, Father. Good-bye.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.825
- Catherine.
- Come in, Aunt Penniman.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.249
Oh, you must hurry, dear.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.506
You were a long time
at that hospital committee.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.128
- Too long.
- Didn't you like it?

05:02.219 --> 05:05.883
Oh, some of the ladies on the committee
are so foolish they're useless.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.385
They think it ill-bred
to know anything about food

05:08.475 --> 05:09.886
or what is done in the kitchen.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.558
Such airs and graces.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.604
Now, when I was young,
we took pride in our housewifery.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.932
My, when I think of the meals I
used to set before the Reverend Penniman,

05:18.026 --> 05:18.026
rest his soul.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.440
- Then you have deceived me, Aunt.
- Why, how so?

05:21.530 --> 05:24.364
You led me to believe
that you and he lived on love alone.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.678
Now, dear,
you see some little witticism like that

05:27.702 --> 05:29.822
would be of interest
to the young people this evening.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.863
It's a very good way to get started.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.667
What I mean is, don't go off
by yourself tonight, will you?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.166
Stay with all of us and enjoy the party.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.963
You have been talking to Father.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.042
Well, yes, dear, in a way I have.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.219
- You see, your father feels —
- Father would like me to be composed

05:47.305 --> 05:49.217
and to join in the conversation.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.388
Yes.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.682
I can't, Aunt Lavinia.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.226
Oh, dear,
perhaps you don't try sufficiently.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.555
Oh, I do, I do.
I would do anything to please him.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.062
There's nothing that means more to me
than that.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.861
I have sat here in my room
and made notes of the things I should say

06:03.947 --> 06:05.438
and how I should say them.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.239
But when I am in company,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.692
it seems that no one
could want to listen to me.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.995
Now, Catherine, if you will stay by me
this evening,

06:13.081 --> 06:16.995
you will see that what I say
is not always of the greatest importance.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.623
But, dear, that doesn't keep me
from talking.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.999
Yes, Aunt.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.706
Now, I'll finish dressing
and meet you downstairs.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.030
Father.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.738
Come in, Catherine.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.617
Good evening, Father. Do I disturb you?

06:51.703 --> 06:54.491
You're not a disturbing woman, my dear.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.161
Do you like my dress?

07:02.255 --> 07:06.750
Is it possible this magnificent person
is my daughter?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.589
But you're sumptuous, opulent.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.638
You look as if you have 80,000 a year.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.091
- I thought you would like the colors.
- Yes!

07:15.936 --> 07:18.098
- It's cherry red.
- So it is.

07:19.481 --> 07:24.397
- I believe my mother used to wear it.
- In her hair ribbons, Austin.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.404
Ah, yes.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.696
But, Catherine, your mother was fair.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.278
She dominated the color.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.747
Well... I must dress.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.035
I'll try not to keep you waiting.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.417
Oh, I must pack our silver punch cups
for Aunt Elizabeth.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.425
Austin, you do think it's entirely proper
for me to go to sister Elizabeth's party?

07:57.519 --> 07:58.885
But of course. Why not?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.595
Well, after all, I'm still in mourning.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.182
Lavinia, I know you'll bear your sorrow
with equal fortitude

08:04.275 --> 08:05.982
whatever the surroundings.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.230
That's right.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.233
After all, I'm just as grief-stricken
no matter where I am.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.143
You're wonderful.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.140
Your Aunt Penniman has made a conquest.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.231
Yes.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.023
Well, having a nice time, Catherine?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.476
Delightful, Aunt Elizabeth.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.902
- So is Jefferson.
- Oh.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.197
Well, Austin, who's sick, who's dead?
Who have you been cutting up lately?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.723
Yes, I can see you're in good shape.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.652
When your gout's troubling you,
you're more respectful to me.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.807
Are you going to get up there
and make that announcement?

08:59.831 --> 09:00.748
Yes, my dear.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.661
- Well, go on. Go on.
- All right, all right.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.293
If he doesn't do it now,
he'll have to make it from under a table.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.213
My good neighbors and dear friends,

09:13.303 --> 09:15.841
I am about to lose the loveliest...

09:16.931 --> 09:18.593
the most beautiful daughter...

09:20.602 --> 09:22.218
very dearest girl,

09:22.854 --> 09:24.811
to a most wonderful young man,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.264
to Arthur Townsend.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.860
I am at once
a sad and a very lucky father.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.983
I'd like you all to toast my loss...

09:35.325 --> 09:36.611
and my gain.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.035
To the happy couple.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.361
To the happy couple!

09:45.502 --> 09:46.993
Oh, Mama.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.706
Oh, don't look so happy.
I'll be home for all my meals.

09:50.799 --> 09:51.799
Uncle Austin.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.917
Marian, my dear,
great happiness to the both of you.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.927
Thank you, sir.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.387
Oh, Cathy, isn't it wonderful?
Isn't this a lovely party?

09:58.473 --> 10:01.216
Come along, Arthur. Let's dance.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.309
Excuse us.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.104
Oh, uh, Quintus.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.149
- You're not dancing.
- No, ma'am.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.568
You remember Catherine Sloper, my niece?

10:12.654 --> 10:13.861
Yes, indeed.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.779
May I have the pleasure, Catherine?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.820
Thank you, Quintus.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.496
Excuse me, Father.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.871
Permit me, Catherine.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.627
Oh, thank you, Father.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.315
Do you suppose there's another Arthur
somewhere in this great city of ours?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.144
- Oh, Catherine will find a husband.
- You think so?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.479
Well, she has the prospect
of 30,000 a year.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.314
I see that you appreciate her.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.025
I don't mean it's her only merit.

11:01.119 --> 11:04.237
But you always have a way of alluding
to her as an unmarriageable girl.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.664
My allusions are as kind as yours, Liz.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.789
Do you suppose Jefferson
has left any of his French brandy?

11:11.880 --> 11:12.916
Let's see.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.383
May I get you some claret cup?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.214
Oh, yes. Thank you.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.725
She's gone to the best schools
in the city.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.607
She's had the finest training
I could get her — music and dancing.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.814
She's sat with me evenings on end.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.527
I've tried to make conversation with her
and give her some social adeptness.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.577
I've given her freedom wherever I could.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.620
The result is what you see,

11:47.707 --> 11:50.324
an entirely mediocre
and defenseless creature

11:50.418 --> 11:52.375
with not a shred of poise.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.001
But, Austin, you are so intolerant.
You expect so much.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.298
You remember her mother, Liz?

11:58.927 --> 12:01.886
Her mother who had so much grace
and gaiety?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.463
This is her child.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.393
Austin, no child could compete
with this image you have of her mother.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.972
You've idealized that poor, dead woman
beyond all human recognition.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.274
You are not entitled to say that.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.816
Only I know what I lost when she died...

12:20.907 --> 12:22.694
and what I got in her place.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.338
Catherine, what are you doing here?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.041
I'm waiting for Quintus Seabury.
He's bringing me some claret cup.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.923
Well, don't wait here, dear.
Make him look for you.

13:14.085 --> 13:18.125
Dancing was the one thing
we disagreed about, the Reverend and I.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.967
Do you suppose
he's watching over me tonight?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.919
That depends on where he is, Aunt.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.914
- Good evening, Mrs. Penniman.
- Oh, good evening.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.099
Good evening!

13:35.189 --> 13:37.647
Catherine, dear, may I present
Mr. Morris Townsend?

13:37.734 --> 13:38.814
How do you do, Miss Sloper.

13:38.860 --> 13:43.025
Mr. Townsend is Arthur's cousin, dear,
and he's just returned from Europe.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.072
How do you do, sir?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.156
Would you have a dance for me,
Miss Sloper?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.359
I believe she has a waltz left.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.780
Excuse me, dear. There is Mr. Abeel.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.128
May I?

13:58.796 --> 13:59.877
Yes.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.299
Which one will it be?

14:06.429 --> 14:07.429
Oh.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.359
Um...

14:24.947 --> 14:27.655
- The fifth?
- The fifth? Thank you.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.985
Two Rs in Morris.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.575
Miss Sloper,
I consider that you do me a great honor.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.203
You see, I'm rather choosy too.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.683
Catherine...

14:54.811 --> 14:55.811
Sloper.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.974
Catherine Sloper.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.182
Catherine Sloper, Catherine Sloper.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.398
You know, we don't have to wait
until the fifth.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.649
- No?
- No.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.267
Miss Sloper, we must make an arrangement.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.936
I will not kick you
if you will not kick me.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.604
Oh, dear, I'm so clumsy.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.651
No, no, it's only that I'm wearing
Arthur's boots,

15:43.693 --> 15:45.059
and he's a very bad dancer.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.069
Now...

15:48.156 --> 15:50.148
one, two, three, point.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.528
One, two, three, point.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.606
- Don't look at your feet.
- Where should I look?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.121
- Look at me.
- Oh.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.428
No.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.329
Very good.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.061
And when we were boys,
Arthur was called "porridge head."

17:08.569 --> 17:09.810
Shall we sit down?

17:10.570 --> 17:14.359
While I've been in Europe,
he's become a promising young businessman.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.903
And now, Miss Sloper,
I think it's time you said something.

17:19.914 --> 17:20.914
Um...

17:21.874 --> 17:25.867
Are you going to remain in New York now,
Mr. Townsend?

17:25.962 --> 17:27.874
What a delightful question.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.627
Well, I haven't been at all sure
of what I was going to do,

17:32.510 --> 17:34.502
but right now I've decided.

17:34.595 --> 17:39.215
Yes, Miss Sloper,
I am going to remain in New York now.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.806
Are you warm?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.478
Let me get you some claret cup.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.726
Oh, no.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.520
Are you a member of the Temperance League?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.727
Uh, yes, I believe I am.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.108
Oh. Well, I'm not.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.985
Will you excuse me for a moment?

18:10.798 --> 18:14.087
Oh, Mr. Abeel,
I can't keep this up any longer.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.542
I must rest.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.631
Catherine, dear,
your old auntie is exhausted.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.842
You finish this delightful polka
for me, dear.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.222
Mr. Abeel is an accomplished dancer.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.229
I...

18:26.230 --> 18:28.347
It would be a pleasure, Miss Sloper.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.329
Oh, Mr. Townsend,
are you looking for my niece?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.364
Yes. She must've been ambushed.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.279
Will you console me?

19:22.370 --> 19:23.781
She'll be back in a moment.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.659
This is his sixth dance in a row.
Now, he just can't keep it up.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.877
You know,

19:30.961 --> 19:34.295
I can dance most of these
young whippersnappers off their feet.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.175
Lavinia?

19:39.637 --> 19:41.879
Oh, Austin, may I present
Mr. Morris Townsend.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.713
Mr. Townsend, my brother, Dr. Sloper.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.410
I've looked forward
to meeting you, Doctor.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.096
- I'm honored.
- Thank you.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.308
Have you had a nice time?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.606
Austin, I've had a most wonderful evening.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.934
And we'd some difficulty
in persuading her to come.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.519
The gentlemen here all owe you
a vote of thanks, Doctor.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.611
Geier will be ready very soon.
Will you tell Catherine?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.533
It's the best part of the evening, sir.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.860
It really is, Austin.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.664
Ah, but you're used to those gay nights
at the parsonage, my dear.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.036
I, alas, must be an early riser.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.540
- Good night, Mr. Townsend.
- Good night, sir.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.249
Oh, Catherine, I have bad news.
We're leaving.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.379
Yes, Aunt.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.464
Where is Mr. Abeel?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.091
He's having a nosebleed.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.843
Oh, dear.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.299
Good night, Mr. Townsend.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.929
Good night, Mrs. Penniman.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.763
I wish to apologize, sir.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.723
You should, Miss Sloper.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.853
Had Mr. Abeel kept his health,
I should've invited him out with sabers.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.024
Well, I...

20:45.870 --> 20:48.362
- I must get my wrap.
- Oh, I, uh...

20:48.456 --> 20:50.322
I just met your father.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.702
Yes, I saw.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.159
He left before I could ask him
when I might call.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.040
His office hours are in the morning.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.792
Are you not well, Mr. Townsend?

20:58.799 --> 21:01.462
I'm in the best of health.
I wish to call on you.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.136
Oh.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.430
Oh.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.263
- Good morning, Mr. Townsend.
- Good morning.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.645
Miss Sloper is not at home, sir.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.735
She isn't?

22:01.487 --> 22:03.103
Why, Mr. Townsend.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.814
- Good morning, Mrs. Penniman.
- Do come in.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.572
I stopped by because Miss Sloper
told me yesterday

22:10.663 --> 22:12.325
she'd be at home this morning.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.622
- Is she really out?
- Oh, yes.

22:14.708 --> 22:18.042
I think she has taken flight
at your third visit this week.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.414
I wonder why.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.168
Oh, I cannot betray a confidence.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.509
- You must ask her that.
- When?

22:25.594 --> 22:26.835
Well...

22:30.182 --> 22:31.673
I know she won't be long.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.053
Thank you, ma'am.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.103
The parsonage was a veritable beehive,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.351
with our spelling matches,
our taffy pulls.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.648
Oh, and in the winter...

22:40.734 --> 22:43.818
In the winter, the sleigh rides
over the Poughkeepsie Hills.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.191
Mrs. Penniman,
do you suppose Catherine will...

22:46.282 --> 22:47.693
I mean, Miss Sloper...

22:47.783 --> 22:50.241
My dear boy, you may let yourself go
when you're with me.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.613
Yes, thank you, but...

22:51.704 --> 22:53.286
She will be home.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.039
Yes, but when?

22:55.082 --> 22:58.450
Oh, Mr. Townsend,
you remind me so of the Reverend Penniman.

22:58.544 --> 23:02.128
The same ardency,
the same passionate nature.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.502
How I wish I might have known him.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.801
Tell me about the doctor, ma'am.
What sort of...

23:11.515 --> 23:13.222
Oh, Catherine, is that you?

23:13.309 --> 23:14.675
Yes, Aunt.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.805
You have a visitor, young lady.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.678
Good morning.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.435
It is a beautiful morning for me now,
Miss Sloper.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.021
For I was afraid
you might not come back at all.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.692
I would have to come back sometime.
I live here.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.986
I know you do, Miss Sloper.
That is why I'm here.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.574
Mr. Townsend wondered if his flowers
had been delivered in good condition.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.747
Yes, thank you. They were very fresh.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.954
I mailed you a note this morning.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.505
I shall treasure it, Miss Sloper,

23:45.591 --> 23:48.504
although I did not send the flowers
in order to be thanked.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.381
I sent them to give you pleasure.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.678
Thank you.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.758
Oh, I... I brought that song
I told you I found in Paris.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.433
Pardon me, ma'am, I'll get it.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.683
- I will leave you alone with him.
- What will I talk about?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.264
You will not have to do the talking.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.896
- My dear child, he has come a-courting.
- Courting me?

24:04.985 --> 24:08.604
Well, certainly not me, miss.
Now, you must be very gracious to him.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.816
Oh, Mr. Townsend, you must excuse me.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.118
I have numerous duties which call me.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.161
I trust that we shall see you again.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.658
I'm your servant, ma'am.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.041
Oh, Catherine,
you haven't forgotten about this evening?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.288
No, Aunt.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.292
Our girl is off to another one
of her endless parties.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.793
It makes me very unhappy to hear that.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.886
What?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.095
That you're so sought after.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.131
It makes my way harder.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.341
I am not going to a party.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.849
My father and I are dining
with Mr. and Mrs. Hone, that's all.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.441
That's what I like you for.
You're so honest.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.231
Tell me something...

24:50.072 --> 24:53.440
did you go out this morning
because you thought I might call?

24:55.244 --> 24:56.244
Yes.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.866
Do you not like to see me?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.539
Yes, I like to see you, Mr. Townsend,

25:01.625 --> 25:04.618
but you have called
so frequently this week...

25:04.712 --> 25:06.419
- You're tired of me?
- Oh, no.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.206
You consider my behavior improper?

25:09.967 --> 25:11.799
I-I do not know.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.127
I am puzzled.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.338
Good. I like that.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.932
If you're puzzled, you're thinking of me.

25:21.395 --> 25:22.727
Is that the song?

25:23.897 --> 25:24.978
Yes.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.936
Will you play it for me?

25:28.819 --> 25:30.151
I do not play.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.738
May I?

25:35.451 --> 25:37.192
I assure you I shan't harm it.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.876
Can you hear me way over there?

26:02.686 --> 26:05.099
You know, on my tenth visit,
you might even sit here.

26:06.523 --> 26:10.392
Mr. Townsend, you are very bold.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.938
<i>♪ Plaisir ♪</i>

26:18.452 --> 26:23.698
<i>♪ Plaisir d'amour ♪</i>

26:24.458 --> 26:28.953
<i>♪ Ne dure qu'un moment ♪</i>

26:29.838 --> 26:33.957
<i>♪ Chagrin d'amour ♪</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:37.010
<i>♪ Dure toute la vie ♪</i>

26:37.554 --> 26:42.094
<i>♪ Toute la vie ♪</i>

26:43.894 --> 26:45.726
Do you know what it means?

26:45.813 --> 26:46.974
No.

26:48.565 --> 26:52.184
The joys... of love.

26:54.154 --> 26:58.068
They last... but a short time.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.453
The pains... of love

27:04.081 --> 27:06.448
last all your life.

27:07.251 --> 27:10.494
All... your life.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.747
It's a lovely song.

27:35.571 --> 27:36.571
You know...

27:37.489 --> 27:39.276
I think of you constantly.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.361
I'm not very good
at this kind of conversation.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.661
Neither am I.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.617
I'm afraid that is our trouble.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.700
I'm not a glib man, Miss Sloper.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.750
I think you talk very well.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.832
Not when I need it most.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.465
Oh, with Mrs. Penniman
or in my room at home,

27:57.551 --> 28:00.589
I can think of
the most delightful things to say.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.633
Can you understand that?

28:03.724 --> 28:05.386
Yes, I can.

28:05.475 --> 28:09.219
But here with you... I sound like a fool.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.770
I don't think so.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.642
You don't?

28:12.733 --> 28:17.273
Well, if ever you do think so,
if ever I sound high-blown or false...

28:18.864 --> 28:20.856
put it down to that, will you?

28:20.949 --> 28:22.906
- I will try.
- And...

28:24.703 --> 28:26.740
take pity on my situation.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.116
What situation?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.241
Miss Sloper...

28:32.711 --> 28:34.828
I've fallen in love with you.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.248
You have?

28:46.266 --> 28:49.350
Ah, Catherine, are you receiving?

28:49.436 --> 28:51.018
Yes, Father. I have a visitor.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.812
Good morning, my dear.
How do you do, Mr. Townsend?

28:53.899 --> 28:54.980
Morning, Dr. Sloper.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.649
Is your cousin here with you?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.397
No, I'm on my own.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.319
- I hope you don't mind.
- Delighted.

29:00.948 --> 29:04.487
I've taken the liberty of calling
on the most attractive young lady.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.196
And her attractive father.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.744
Oh! We're not that attractive.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.827
Well, I'd like my sherry and biscuits.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.159
Perhaps Mr. Townsend might enjoy some
with me.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.334
I'd be honored.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.794
Hmm, that's an excellent bay rum
you're using, Mr. Townsend.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.046
I brought it with me from France, Doctor.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.752
Permit me to share it with you.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.554
Thank you. Very kind,
but I can hardly let you do that.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.594
Well...

29:32.688 --> 29:34.680
have you been out this morning, my dear?

29:36.108 --> 29:37.394
Uh, Catherine?

29:38.068 --> 29:42.153
Oh, yes. I stopped by to see Mr. Rougini
after breakfast.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.276
Oh, yes, about the lessons.
What did he say?

29:46.702 --> 29:49.285
You need a very true ear for the harp.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.535
It seems that I have not a very true ear.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.367
Nonsense. That's impossible.
Your mother's ear was impeccable.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.580
Yes, Father, I know.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.287
She used to tune her own piano.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.457
Miss Sloper has a great appreciation
for music.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.258
That is a talent in itself.

30:05.846 --> 30:06.846
Aha.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.681
Is cook's knee any better, Maria?

30:10.767 --> 30:12.633
'Tis a little easier this morning, Doctor.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.469
I'll be up to see her in a while.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.727
Here... give that to Mr. Townsend.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.354
You're very kind, sir.

30:20.444 --> 30:23.903
Most great doctors are too busy
to see the illness under their noses.

30:23.989 --> 30:27.107
Mr. Townsend, you're full of agreeable
and flattering observations,

30:27.200 --> 30:28.657
both for Catherine and myself.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.656
That is the way you both strike me, sir.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.658
I told Miss Sloper earlier,
I'm very candid.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.456
Oh, yes, he is... very candid.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.128
How long do you plan to remain in our city,
Mr. Townsend?

30:41.214 --> 30:43.206
Oh, my stay is quite indefinite, sir.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.667
Will you dine with us
one evening this week?

30:45.761 --> 30:48.879
- Doctor, I should be delighted.
- Shall we say Thursday at 6:00?

30:48.972 --> 30:50.258
- Thank you, sir.
- Ah.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.303
I was there quite a while.
Of course not as long as I should've liked.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.276
But I think you will find
Paris changed, Doctor.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.191
I hope not.
I should like it to be exactly as it was.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.689
You see, Dr. Sloper went there
on his wedding trip.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.988
Oh, in that case,
Paris can never change for you, Doctor.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.452
How do you keep busy since your return
to New York, Mr. Townsend?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.870
I'm looking for a position.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.791
Well, your studies abroad
should open many avenues to you.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.335
I engaged in no studies, Mrs. Penniman.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.583
I was merely idling.

31:23.673 --> 31:28.338
You see, sir, I had a small inheritance,
and... that was how I used it up.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.511
What sort of position should you prefer?

31:31.098 --> 31:33.841
You mean what am I fit for?
Very little, I'm afraid.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.557
I have nothing but my good right arm,
as they say in the melodramas.

31:37.646 --> 31:38.978
Oh, you're too modest.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.727
In addition to your good right arm,
you have a very good mind.

31:41.817 --> 31:45.185
I know nothing of you but what I see,
but I see you are extremely intelligent.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.359
Oh, yes.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.647
Thank you very much.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.153
You advise me then not to despair?

31:51.243 --> 31:52.825
I should be very sorry to admit

31:52.911 --> 31:56.404
that a robust, well-disposed man
need ever despair.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.741
If he doesn't succeed in one thing,
he can try another.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.702
Only he should choose with discretion.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.583
Oh, yes, with discretion.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.213
Were you kindly intending
to propose something for my advantage?

32:09.302 --> 32:11.635
No, I've no particular proposal to make.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.678
But I hear the West is opening up.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.473
Many young men are turning their eyes
in that direction.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.761
I'm afraid
I shouldn't be able to manage that.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.438
You see, I have ties here. My sister...

32:22.524 --> 32:24.641
Oh, yes, Mrs. Montgomery, Austin.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.397
Liz knows her.
They met at a charity bazaar.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.238
She's widowed.
Now that I'm back, I'm staying with her.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.862
She lives in the Second Avenue.
She's very dependent on me.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.988
Naturally.

32:35.078 --> 32:39.413
Um, Mr. Townsend
has five little nephews and nieces.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.365
He is helping to bring them up.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.328
Yes, I give them lessons.
I'm a kind of tutor.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.502
Oh, that's very proper.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.923
Family feeling is very proper...
but it's hardly a career.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.126
No, it won't make my fortune.

32:51.219 --> 32:55.088
Ah. You mustn't be too much bent
on a fortune.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.591
Mr. Townsend, I've looked forward
to an evening at home,

32:58.685 --> 33:01.723
but the Hospital Commission is in session,
and I am to address them.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.292
- I understand perfectly, sir.
- Lavinia, I hope you'll excuse me.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.316
Of course, Austin.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.897
Catherine, my dear, you will extend
the honors of the house to Mr. Townsend.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.314
I'm very grateful for your interest, sir.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.525
Yes... Yes, indeed.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.000
He doesn't like me.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.795
He doesn't like me at all.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.422
I don't see how you know.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.084
I feel. I'm very quick to feel.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.219
Perhaps you are mistaken.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.305
You ask him, you'll see.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.929
Then I would rather not ask him.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
How nice.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.063
But you wouldn't contradict him.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.891
I never contradict him.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.819
Austin, isn't he a charming young man?

33:59.913 --> 34:02.246
I never dreamed
he'd be so interested in Catherine.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.249
Nor did I.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.663
He's so agreeable, so elegant.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.495
He may find it hard to maintain
so much elegance in this city

34:08.588 --> 34:09.623
without working for it.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.751
But he's looking for a position
most earnestly.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.333
I wonder
if he's looking for it here, Lavinia.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.089
- What?
- Wouldn't the position of husband

34:16.179 --> 34:18.466
to a defenseless young girl
with a large fortune

34:18.556 --> 34:20.047
suit him to perfection?

34:20.141 --> 34:21.928
How can you entertain such a suspicion?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.351
Suspicion? It's a diagnosis, my dear.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.393
But you're not in your clinic now, Austin.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.938
Why, Morris Townsend would be a feather
in any girl's cap.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.938
You have only to use your eyes
which are as good as mine.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.518
- Better.
- Austin!

34:33.612 --> 34:37.357
Well, then you must help this along
and be thankful that he's come about.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.367
Very well, Lavinia.

34:38.368 --> 34:42.737
While I'm being thankful, I hope you
will not forget your duties as chaperone.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.039
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Austin.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.081
Catherine, have you
any spirits of camphor in the house?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.460
I have one of my headaches.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.735
- Headaches, Aunt?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.753
I never talk about them.
They strike like a thief in the night.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.884
- You must permit me to retire.
- Of course.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.466
- But, Aunt!
- I know it's not like me to give in, dear,

35:03.560 --> 35:05.802
but sometimes fortitude is folly.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.102
Good night, dear.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.430
- Good night, Mr. Townsend.
- Good night.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.151
Poor Mrs. Penniman.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.444
May I offer you your port
in the drawing room?

35:21.411 --> 35:22.527
You see?

35:24.664 --> 35:25.664
Yes?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.203
Your aunt, she's on my side.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.376
She wouldn't let your father abuse me.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.751
My father won't abuse you.
He doesn't know you well enough.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.672
You know...

35:37.636 --> 35:38.636
Oh!

35:39.679 --> 35:41.671
I would have liked you to say to me,

35:41.765 --> 35:44.678
"If my father doesn't think well of you,
what does it matter?"

35:44.768 --> 35:48.011
Oh, but it would matter.
I could never say that.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.614
You could do anything
for one whom you love.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.909
My dearest girl...

36:05.163 --> 36:07.325
you must believe how much I care for you.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.867
You're everything I've ever yearned for
in a woman.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.830
But I am... I am so...

36:26.643 --> 36:27.804
Oh, Catherine.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.766
Will you marry me?

36:32.440 --> 36:33.440
Yes.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.856
You make me very happy.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.856
Do you love me?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.031
Yes.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.743
Oh, Catherine.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.002
I... love you.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.140
I'll cherish you forever.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.029
Oh, we must speak to my father.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.115
I will do it tonight.
You must do it tomorrow.

37:25.201 --> 37:28.820
It's sweet of you to want to do it first.
The young man generally does that.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.782
Oh, women have more tact.
They can persuade better.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.868
You'll need all your powers of persuasion.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.339
Naturally, your father wants
a brilliant marriage for you, Catherine.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.336
And I'm a poor man.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.261
- Oh, my father will not care about that.
- He might.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.259
He might fear that I'm mercenary.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.682
Mercenary? Oh, no.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.510
He may say it.

37:52.604 --> 37:56.063
Well, I shall simply say it isn't so.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.274
You must make a great point of that,
Catherine.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
Why?

38:02.197 --> 38:05.065
Because it's from the fact
of your having money

38:05.825 --> 38:07.441
that our difficulties may come.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.572
Oh, Morris...

38:10.371 --> 38:13.739
are you very sure you... love me?

38:14.542 --> 38:16.124
Oh, my own dearest...

38:18.338 --> 38:19.704
can you doubt it?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.855
Since your aunt has left us alone,

38:47.617 --> 38:49.825
it's not proper that I stay any longer.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.452
Yes, Morris.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.875
I'll be back in the morning
to call on your father.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.543
At what time?

39:00.463 --> 39:01.920
At 11:00 sharp.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.588
I will tell him.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.918
And, please, Morris, promise me this:

39:07.011 --> 39:10.846
When you speak with Father,
you will be very gentle, very respectful.

39:10.932 --> 39:11.968
Of course.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.800
And there's something you must promise me:

39:15.478 --> 39:17.344
If your father's against me,

39:18.147 --> 39:20.514
you'll still be faithful
no matter what comes.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.649
Yes, Morris.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.276
No matter what comes.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.605
You know, you're your own mistress.
You're of age.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.860
Oh, I love you.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.575
I will always love you.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.573
My dear girl.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.192
Oh, Father!

40:55.286 --> 40:57.494
- Have you waited up for me?
- Yes, Father, I...

40:57.580 --> 40:59.321
I have something to tell you!

40:59.415 --> 41:00.656
- Have you?
- Yes!

41:00.750 --> 41:02.082
Well...

41:03.294 --> 41:06.628
Let us go into the back parlor and hear it.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.469
Now, my dear,

41:14.555 --> 41:17.093
do you suppose
that we might both sit down?

41:32.156 --> 41:33.692
Well, now?

41:34.367 --> 41:36.359
I am engaged to be married.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.869
You do right to tell me.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.291
And whom have you honored
with your choice?

41:48.881 --> 41:50.998
Mr. Morris Townsend.

41:53.553 --> 41:54.885
You have gone fast.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.714
Yes, I think we have.

41:59.809 --> 42:02.722
Mr. Townsend out to have waited
and told me.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.556
Oh, he means to tell you,
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

42:06.649 --> 42:09.016
It's not quite the same thing, my dear.

42:09.736 --> 42:13.650
You shouldn't be pleading for him.
He should plead for you.

42:13.740 --> 42:18.326
Yes, Father, but I think he is...
a little afraid of you.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.034
Is he?

42:20.121 --> 42:23.239
He fears that you do not like him.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.159
Well, I hardly know him, Catherine.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.245
But our liking each other isn't important.

42:29.338 --> 42:33.252
The only thing that is important
is that <i>he</i>... love you.

42:33.342 --> 42:34.549
He does.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.298
He loves me and I love him.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.178
It is a great wonder to me
that Morris has come into my life.

42:42.435 --> 42:47.897
Oh, Father, don't you think he is
the most beautiful man you've ever seen?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.974
Well, he's very good-looking, my dear.

42:50.693 --> 42:54.061
Of course, you wouldn't let a consideration
like that sway you unduly.

42:54.155 --> 42:57.068
Oh, no!
But that is what is so wonderful to me,

42:57.158 --> 43:00.742
that he should have everything,
everything a woman could want,

43:01.287 --> 43:02.778
and he wants me.

43:13.341 --> 43:14.798
I'll see him tomorrow.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.959
I knew you would!

43:17.053 --> 43:20.797
And you are so good
that you will be fair and honest with him.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.846
I shall be as fair and honest with him
as he is with you.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.770
Thank you, Father.
That is all we shall need.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.441
Aunt Penniman.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.272
Aunt Penniman!

44:18.573 --> 44:19.609
Oh, Catherine!

44:20.741 --> 44:22.107
He proposed to me.

44:22.201 --> 44:25.114
- Does your father know?
- Yes.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.491
- What did he say?
- He will see Morris in the morning.

44:27.582 --> 44:28.618
Eureka!

44:29.375 --> 44:31.537
- How is your headache now, Aunt?
- Headache?

44:32.712 --> 44:33.712
Shh!

45:07.872 --> 45:09.204
Good morning, my dear.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.366
This is my brother, Dr. Sloper,
Mrs. Montgomery.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.260
Mrs. Montgomery has been good
to come, Austin.

45:14.337 --> 45:17.125
- I'm very grateful to you, ma'am.
- I'm glad to come.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.443
She left a busy household
just on the strength of your note.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.487
I should more properly have gone to you,
but this is one of my mornings at the clinic.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.049
I dared not take the time off
to make a formal call.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.926
Oh, I quite understand, Doctor.

45:27.016 --> 45:28.257
- Elizabeth?
- Oh, certainly.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.762
- Will you excuse me.
- Certainly.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.455
I should like to see my sister
while I'm here.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.999
Mrs. Montgomery, will you
come into the study where we may talk?

45:34.023 --> 45:35.764
Yes, sir.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.649
You must understand my situation,
Mrs. Montgomery.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.402
Your brother wishes to marry my daughter.

45:44.492 --> 45:48.486
So I want you to tell me
something about his character.

45:49.038 --> 45:51.200
What sort of a gentleman is he?

45:51.290 --> 45:54.658
Well, Doctor, he's intelligent, charming.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.163
He's a wonderful companion.

45:56.254 --> 45:57.620
Yes, I know that.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.705
But is he reliable? Is he trustworthy?

45:59.799 --> 46:02.132
Is he... responsible?

46:02.218 --> 46:06.428
Well, if you mean is he financially secure,
he is not, Doctor.

46:06.514 --> 46:09.928
- But I'm sure you must know that.
- Yes, he told me that himself.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.384
That is another thing about Morris —
He's honest.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.719
Is he?

46:13.813 --> 46:17.352
Is he then honest in his feeling
for my daughter?

46:17.441 --> 46:19.603
I don't know that, Doctor.

46:19.694 --> 46:23.108
I never could say what goes on
in people's hearts.

46:23.698 --> 46:24.698
Could you?

46:25.283 --> 46:26.865
Well, I have to try, ma'am.

46:27.535 --> 46:31.074
He told me that he used up
a small inheritance.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.654
Did he handle it well?

46:32.748 --> 46:34.956
Probably you would not think so, Doctor.

46:35.042 --> 46:38.206
But from his own point of view,
he did a great deal with it.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.380
He saw Europe
and met many interesting people.

46:41.465 --> 46:43.627
He enlarged his capacities.

46:43.718 --> 46:45.630
Did he help you, ma'am?

46:47.221 --> 46:48.179
No.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.513
- Shouldn't he have?
- I don't think so.

46:50.599 --> 46:53.717
You are a widow and you have children.
I think so.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.929
Oh, but if I needed it,
I know he would have helped me.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.309
Are you sure?

46:59.442 --> 47:03.652
You want me to complain about him, sir.
But I have no complaints.

47:04.322 --> 47:07.736
I brought him up as if he were my child.

47:07.825 --> 47:12.320
And I have accepted the good and bad in him
just as I accept them in my children.

47:12.413 --> 47:15.121
I have made you angry, ma'am. I apologize.

47:16.292 --> 47:21.412
I... think, Doctor...
you expect too much of people.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.918
If you do, you'll always be disappointed.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.543
I want you to meet my daughter.

47:28.971 --> 47:30.712
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

47:37.855 --> 47:38.936
Catherine.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.480
Catherine?

47:40.566 --> 47:41.682
Yes, Father?

47:41.776 --> 47:44.769
- Will you come into the study, please?
- Yes, Father.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.524
This is she?

47:51.118 --> 47:52.859
No, that is a picture of my wife.

47:52.953 --> 47:56.287
- Oh, she's very beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.411
- Very beautiful.
- Oh.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.707
Catherine, this is Mrs. Montgomery,
Mr. Townsend's sister.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.163
Miss Sloper.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.043
Oh, how do you do?

48:06.133 --> 48:08.341
I am very happy to meet you.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.095
Thank you. Isn't Morris coming?

48:12.181 --> 48:14.218
His appointment is for 11:00, Catherine.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.389
Oh, yes.

48:25.361 --> 48:28.274
- Are your children well?
- Quite well, thank you.

48:28.364 --> 48:31.948
I hope Morris will bring you
to see me and my family very soon.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.241
Oh, yes.

48:35.538 --> 48:39.327
My-My brother tells me that you
have an aunt visiting you, Miss Sloper.

48:39.417 --> 48:40.417
Yes.

48:44.130 --> 48:48.295
It-It is delightful to have someone
to whom one can show New York.

48:48.384 --> 48:51.092
Oh... yes, it is.

48:54.432 --> 48:57.470
Does she... like our city?

48:58.227 --> 48:59.388
Yes.

49:00.521 --> 49:03.730
Catherine, perhaps you'll offer
Mrs. Montgomery a glass of the Madeira.

49:03.816 --> 49:05.227
Oh, yes, indeed.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.187
Excuse me, ma'am.

49:16.745 --> 49:17.745
She...

49:18.664 --> 49:20.405
She is very shy.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.115
Yes, she is.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.080
Perhaps she is less shy with Morris.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.507
Now, you said
they have just fallen in love.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.380
You were right about Catherine.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.632
Were you right about your brother?

49:35.097 --> 49:36.133
Well...

49:36.849 --> 49:38.636
I can only suppose that...

49:38.726 --> 49:42.720
that Morris is more mature in his feelings
than I thought.

49:43.939 --> 49:47.057
This time he has not sought out
superficial charms.

49:47.902 --> 49:50.440
Perhaps he's considered
the gentle character underneath.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.145
Are you being honest?

49:52.781 --> 49:53.897
I think I am.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.530
Well, I believe her money
is the prime attraction.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.486
- What money?
- She's an heiress.

50:00.289 --> 50:02.076
Didn't your brother tell you that?

50:03.334 --> 50:04.334
No, he did not.

50:04.335 --> 50:06.702
She has 10,000 a year from her mother,

50:06.795 --> 50:09.458
and on my death,
she will have twice as much more.

50:09.548 --> 50:12.541
She... she will be immensely rich.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.297
Yes, she will, of course.

50:14.386 --> 50:18.380
If she marries a man I don't approve,
I shall leave my part to the clinic.

50:18.974 --> 50:22.138
Yes, but... but she has the 10,000 now.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.435
Yes, she has.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.389
That is still a great deal of money,
Doctor.

50:27.483 --> 50:30.897
It is. And consider
how he has behaved with money.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.777
He gratified his every wish.

50:33.864 --> 50:36.151
Did he help you with the children? No.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.279
He enlarged his capacities in Europe.

50:40.579 --> 50:43.572
He left his gloves here last night,
the finest chamois.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.248
Look at yours.

50:45.334 --> 50:47.667
Will he help you with his fortune
he hopes to marry?

50:47.753 --> 50:50.166
I would stake my life he would not.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.050
You must follow your own dictates, Doctor.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.423
Tell me she's not a victim
of his selfishness.

50:58.514 --> 50:59.925
Tell me I am wrong.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.475
I must go now.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.618
Good day, Doctor.

51:25.708 --> 51:26.994
Good day, ma'am.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.671
Oh, has Mrs. Montgomery left?
I wanted Lavinia to meet her.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.841
Yes, Liz, she has left.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.715
- Did you like her, Austin?
- Very much.

51:39.805 --> 51:40.805
Oh, good.

51:40.806 --> 51:44.516
You know, Catherine has just asked Elizabeth
if Marian might be her maid of honor.

51:44.602 --> 51:47.891
Austin, Catherine is radiant.
I've never seen her this way before.

51:47.980 --> 51:49.096
Well, she must get over it.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.851
- He is worthless.
- What?

51:50.941 --> 51:52.352
The man's a fortune hunter.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.400
All he's interested in is her money.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.067
Are you going to tell that to Catherine?

51:59.325 --> 52:00.325
No.

52:00.701 --> 52:01.817
Oh, but, Austin...

52:02.620 --> 52:05.203
Catherine, Mrs. Montgomery has left.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.951
Oh, I took too long.

52:07.041 --> 52:09.078
I wanted to make the tray especially nice.

52:09.168 --> 52:12.502
It was not your fault, my dear.
We have concluded our talk.

52:12.588 --> 52:13.624
Concluded?

52:15.424 --> 52:18.132
Did Mrs. Montgomery tell you
something bad, Father?

52:18.677 --> 52:20.088
No, Catherine.

52:20.179 --> 52:21.761
I did not impress her favorably.

52:21.847 --> 52:24.931
Oh, good heavens, Catherine.
Don't hold yourself so cheaply.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.727
I was embarrassed.
I won't be another time.

52:31.982 --> 52:33.974
You had better go to your room, Catherine.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.068
Yes.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.941
Father, tell him about me.

52:43.035 --> 52:44.742
You know me so well.

52:44.828 --> 52:49.448
It will not be immodest in you...
to praise me a little.

53:03.681 --> 53:07.174
How is it possible to protect
such a willing victim?

53:07.893 --> 53:09.976
You will kill her
if you deny her this marriage.

53:10.062 --> 53:12.770
You forget I'm a doctor.
People don't die of such things.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.597
Be very careful, Austin.

53:15.275 --> 53:18.859
This man may take good care of Catherine
and her money and make her very happy.

53:18.946 --> 53:20.733
He will. I know he will.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.530
But she's been taken in.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.158
She's in love.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.704
Mr. Townsend is in the front parlor, sir.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.855
Good morning, Mr. Townsend.

53:59.945 --> 54:02.107
How do you do, sir? You expected me?

54:02.197 --> 54:05.440
Yes, I did. You're admirably prompt.

54:05.534 --> 54:08.072
I could hardly be late
for so important an occasion.

54:08.162 --> 54:12.031
Yes. Catherine told me yesterday
what has been going on between you.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.324
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.

54:15.169 --> 54:16.938
I've been walking all morning,
and, you know, sir,

54:16.962 --> 54:20.455
I find New York as lovely as any city
in Europe this time of year.

54:20.549 --> 54:21.466
Yes.

54:21.467 --> 54:23.675
You must allow me to say, Mr. Townsend,

54:23.761 --> 54:27.471
that it would have been becoming of you
to give me notice of your intentions

54:27.556 --> 54:29.422
before they had gone so far.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.429
It was only the other day
that Catherine made your acquaintance.

54:32.936 --> 54:36.520
We've not been slow to arrive
at an understanding.

54:36.607 --> 54:39.771
My interest in Miss Sloper
began the first time I saw her.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.728
Did it not even precede your first meeting?

54:44.281 --> 54:47.024
I certainly had already heard
she was a delightful girl.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.528
A delightful girl.
That's what you think her?

54:51.997 --> 54:53.829
Otherwise, I shouldn't be here.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.662
Well, my dear young man,
as Catherine's father,

54:56.752 --> 55:00.496
I hope I've a just appreciation
of her many good qualities.

55:00.589 --> 55:04.583
But I don't mind telling you I've
never quite thought of her in that light.

55:05.594 --> 55:08.337
I don't know what I might think of her
if I were her father.

55:08.847 --> 55:10.463
I speak from my own point of view.

55:10.557 --> 55:12.719
Well, you speak very well. Please sit down.

55:13.727 --> 55:17.892
But did you really expect that
I would throw my daughter into your arms?

55:18.690 --> 55:21.478
No. I had an idea you didn't like me.

55:22.486 --> 55:24.022
What gave you that idea?

55:24.446 --> 55:25.687
The fact that I'm poor.

55:27.032 --> 55:29.570
Well, that has a harsh sound,

55:29.660 --> 55:31.401
but it's about the truth.

55:31.495 --> 55:33.828
You've no profession, means...

55:34.289 --> 55:35.289
Please sit.

55:36.124 --> 55:38.286
No visible resources or prospects,

55:38.377 --> 55:42.246
and so you are in a category
from which <i>not</i> to choose a son-in-law.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.002
Particularly, not for my daughter,
who is a weak young woman

55:45.092 --> 55:46.503
with a large fortune.

55:46.593 --> 55:48.050
I don't think Miss Sloper is weak.

55:48.136 --> 55:50.549
Well, even if she were not,
you are still penniless.

55:50.639 --> 55:52.722
Ah, yes, that is my weakness.

55:52.808 --> 55:54.595
And, therefore, you mean I'm mercenary.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.426
No, I don't say that. You say that.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.681
But that's what you mean.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.521
There are many poor men, Mr. Townsend,

56:00.607 --> 56:03.645
but they don't go through the streets
proclaiming that they are not thieves.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.818
Especially when no one has accused them.

56:05.904 --> 56:09.193
I simply said
you are in the wrong category.

56:09.283 --> 56:12.867
But your daughter doesn't marry a category,
she marries a man,

56:13.453 --> 56:15.410
a man she's good enough to say she loves.

56:15.497 --> 56:17.989
A man who offers nothing in return?

56:18.917 --> 56:20.499
Is it possible to offer more

56:20.586 --> 56:23.624
than the most tender affection
and a lifelong devotion?

56:23.714 --> 56:26.627
A lifelong devotion is measured
after the fact.

56:26.717 --> 56:29.460
Meanwhile, it's usual to offer
a few material securities.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.469
Well, what are yours?

56:30.470 --> 56:32.712
A handsome face and figure
and a very good manner.

56:32.806 --> 56:36.425
Oh, they're excellent as far as they go,
but they don't go far enough.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.851
- You think I'm an idler?
- It doesn't matter what I think

56:38.937 --> 56:41.680
once I tell you I just don't think of you
as a son-in-law.

56:41.773 --> 56:45.483
- You think I'd squander her money?
- Ah... I plead guilty to that.

56:46.028 --> 56:48.020
Because I spent my own, I suppose.

56:48.113 --> 56:51.606
Well, it was just because it was my own
that I spent it. I've made no debts.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.191
When it was gone I stopped.

56:53.285 --> 56:54.867
I don't owe a penny in the world.

56:54.953 --> 56:58.537
What are you living on now?

57:01.001 --> 57:02.742
The remnants of my property.

57:12.721 --> 57:15.008
You left your gloves here yesterday.

57:16.934 --> 57:17.970
Thank you.

57:19.978 --> 57:23.187
Doctor, don't you care
to gratify your daughter?

57:24.066 --> 57:26.183
Do you enjoy the idea
of making her miserable?

57:26.276 --> 57:29.314
I'm resigned to her thinking me a tyrant
for a few months.

57:29.404 --> 57:30.770
A few months?

57:30.864 --> 57:32.696
For a lifetime, then.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.241
She may as well be miserable that way
as with you.

57:36.495 --> 57:38.202
You are not polite, sir.

57:38.664 --> 57:40.030
You push me to it.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.248
You argue too much.

57:42.334 --> 57:45.202
- I have a great deal at stake.
- I know. And you have lost it.

57:45.295 --> 57:48.038
- It is over.
- I wouldn't be too sure of that, sir.

57:49.383 --> 57:51.090
You are impertinent.

58:03.188 --> 58:06.226
Dr. Sloper, if it were not
for my feeling for Catherine,

58:06.316 --> 58:09.309
I should not have put up with
the indignities you've offered me today.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.986
You have only to leave my house
to escape them.

58:12.072 --> 58:13.608
Good day, Mr. Townsend.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.198
- Good day.
- Morris! Wait!

58:16.284 --> 58:18.446
Morris! You promised me, Morris.

58:18.537 --> 58:22.201
You promised you would be — you would
be respectful when you saw my father.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.748
- Catherine.
- What is the matter, Father?

58:24.835 --> 58:26.701
Catherine, you are without dignity.

58:28.422 --> 58:31.290
Why are you angry?
Why are you and Morris quarreling?

58:31.383 --> 58:33.966
- Tell me, please.
- I will tell you when we are alone.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.260
Your father does not approve of me,
Catherine.

58:39.516 --> 58:42.509
- You want me to give him up?
- Yes, I do.

58:43.103 --> 58:46.687
Why? What has he done?

58:46.773 --> 58:48.935
What did Mrs. Montgomery tell you?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.268
My sister, have you spoken with her?

58:51.361 --> 58:54.445
She paid my a visit this morning
on my invitation.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.194
You see how painful this is for me, Father.

58:57.284 --> 58:59.651
Surely you will want me to know
your reasons.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.362
- He's a selfish idler.
- My sister never said that.

59:02.456 --> 59:04.118
No, I say it.

59:04.207 --> 59:07.700
Father, I know he loves me.

59:07.794 --> 59:10.081
I know that he does not.

59:11.006 --> 59:14.590
In heaven's name, Father,
what makes you so sure?

59:15.719 --> 59:19.884
My poor child, I can't tell you.
You must just take my word for it.

59:20.891 --> 59:24.225
Father, I can't. I can't.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.053
I love him.

59:28.732 --> 59:30.689
I have promised to marry him,

59:31.401 --> 59:35.361
to stay by him no matter what comes.

59:36.656 --> 59:40.525
So, he forearmed himself
by getting a promise like that, did he?

59:41.995 --> 59:44.453
You are beneath contempt.

59:44.956 --> 59:46.743
Don't abuse him, Father.

59:54.508 --> 59:57.000
I think we shall marry quite soon.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.133
Then it is no further concern of mine.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.637
- I'm sorry.
- Dr. Sloper.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.771
We cannot marry without your approval.
It would bring unhappiness to all of us.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:13.311
- Do you mean that, sir?
- Yes.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:18.776
Then, will you put it off,
Mr. Townsend, for six months?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.566
I would like Catherine
to go to Europe with me.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.869
- Europe?
- I would like you very much to go, Catherine.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.162
Why, Father?

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.490
Your father thinks you will forget me,
Catherine.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.293
I shall still love him when I come back.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.544
You're very sure of your love but,
Catherine, do you dare to test him?

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.922
- You underestimate him.
- I don't think so.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.387
Catherine... go to Europe.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.927
Go to Europe with your father.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.532
Sloper is the name.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.325
- That way, sir.
- Ah.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:19.924
I'll be right back.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.470
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, ma'am. Catherine.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.224
I came because I felt sure
you would not deny me the opportunity

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.051
of wishing you both a safe journey.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:33.684
- Thank you very much.
- Morris, I'm glad you came.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:36.607
I've brought Miss Sloper a small gift, sir.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:40.312
Mr. Townsend, it is not usual
for young ladies in my daughter's situation

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.146
to receive gifts from gentlemen.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.153
Yes, Doctor, I know,
but this is a very humble gift.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:48.702
- It's only a little hand warmer.
- Father, I would like to have it.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:56.994
You must put live charcoals in it,
Catherine.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.921
I give it to you with all my love.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.303
Morris!

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:18.641
I will be thinking of you, Catherine.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.733
Good day, ma'am. Bon voyage, Doctor.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.846
I never expected to hear a sermon
like that in New York City.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.612
Now, when the Reverend Penniman
sermonized on the loaves and fishes,

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.347
they were there right before you.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.098
You could practically smell them.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.020
Look, Mrs. Penniman, you've lost.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.854
- Why is it you always win?
- I cheat.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:05.313
Mrs. Penniman,
had it not been for your invitations,

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:07.649
these past few months
would have been unbearable.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.859
You like this house, don't you, Morris?

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.160
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.369
You know,
the doctor is a man of fine taste.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.373
It is strange that although we do not like
each other, we seem to like the same things.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.796
That can be a bond between you in time.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:26.668
I hope so. But, you see,
he's earned all of this by his work.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.718
He believes that every man
should do the same.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:31.755
The trouble is that some of us cannot.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:36.056
- You miss her, don't you, Morris?
- Very much.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.933
Dinner is served, Mrs. Penniman.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.143
Yes, Maria.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:44.478
- And the claret is room temperature.
- Thank you, Maria.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:11.088
- I hope I haven't kept you waiting, Father.
- No, my dear.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:14.470
- Wouldn't you prefer to go inside?
- I like this table.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.102
Oh.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:21.890
Did you... used to come here
with my mother?

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.317
Yes, Catherine, I did.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:29.567
- Would you like some chocolate?
- No, thank you very much.

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:34.702
Oh! There's the Café Riche.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.029
So it is. What about it?

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.865
Aunt Penniman mentioned it
in her last letter.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:39.994
Lavinia?

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.247
She said that all the best people of...

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.255
Paris frequent it.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:50.009
A winter of loneliness
has given her second sight.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.470
- Something for mademoiselle?
- No, thank you.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.717
<i>Bien, monsieur.</i>

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.554
Have you given him up?

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.432
No, Father.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:06.101
You mean that in all this time
you have not yielded one inch?

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.022
No, Father.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:13.107
I see no reason to prolong this trip.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:14.201
Do you?

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.033
I thought you wanted to see England.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:24.205
I've seen England.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.649
The pilot's gone down the bay.
They are to dock within the hour.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.358
We're almost ready.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.828
Maria, did you find my gloves?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.372
As soon as I warm the beds,
I'll look again.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:05.122
Oh, Geier, we have to be at the pier
in half an hour.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.211
I'm harnessed, ma'am.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.196
What an inconvenient hour to land!

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.491
Now, you will be careful
to get the details right, won't you?

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.828
- They are most important.
- Of course!

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.498
You will have a closed carriage
at the corner of MacDougal Street

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.042
tomorrow evening as soon as it gets dark.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:51.418
- Tomorrow night at 9:00.
- Yes, at 9:00.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.966
Oh, here they are!

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:59.012
- Now, tell her everything.
- I will.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.714
- Tell her I love her.
- I will, I will.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.970
Now, you wait in the mews
for my signal, Morris.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.472
Giddap, King! Up.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.608
Oh, Catherine!

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:16.355
Oh, Catherine, you look so French.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.859
Well, no matter how fascinating
distant places are,

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:23.537
there's always someone at home
one misses, isn't there?

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.785
I've-I've caught a chill, Lavinia.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.868
Would you be so kind as to get me
some hot water for a toddy?

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.544
Why, of course, Austin.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.759
- It's good to be home, isn't it, Father?
- Mmm.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:43.056
You'll feel better now that we're back.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:49.563
I... I wish you had let me
try to care of you a little.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:56.236
- Here you are, Austin.
- Thank you, Lavinia.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.154
Your brandy decanter is right there.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:00.492
Well...

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:04.199
- Have you taken to drink, Lavinia?
- What?

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:08.078
Oh. My heart.
I thought it would help my heart.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.658
Ah, yes.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.669
Oh. I know I shouldn't ask you, Catherine,
but did you bring me something?

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:19.251
- We brought you a silk parasol.
- Just exactly what I wanted.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.461
Come and show it to me.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:24.720
Your heart would improve, Lavinia,
if you stopped smoking cigars.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:25.809
What?

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.224
When I come home to find
empty brandy glasses

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:33.479
and detect cigar bands,
I can only think of one person.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.731
Well, what's happened to Mr. Townsend?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.608
Is he upstairs in my bed?

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:42.988
Austin, I forgot to tell you.
He did stop by this evening.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.660
This evening?
Was he here this evening, Aunt?

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:49.491
- Yes, yes.
- So he's made my house his club.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.416
You should be in bed.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:55.086
Now, I'll just see that everything
has been attended to.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:02.256
What a ridiculous position to be in.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:06.932
Well, I suppose you'll be going off
with him anytime now.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.176
Yes, if he will have me.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.356
Why not? You'll be
a most entertaining companion.

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:15.978
I will try to be.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.856
Your gaiety and brilliance

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:21.234
will make up the difference between
the 10,000 a year you will have

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.657
and the 30,000 he expects.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.404
He expects nothing.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.952
He does not love me for that.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.200
No? What else, then?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.285
Your grace, your charm,
your quick tongue and subtle wit?

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.911
He admires me.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.712
Catherine, I've tried for months
not to be unkind.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.131
But now it's time
for you to realize the truth.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:43.548
How many girls do you think
he might have had in this town?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:48.303
- He finds me pleasing.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure he does.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:51.636
A hundred women are prettier,
a thousand more clever.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.893
But you have one virtue
that outshines them all.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.688
- What? What is that?
- Your money!

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.862
- Father!
- You have nothing else!

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:04.241
Oh.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.779
What a terrible thing to say to me.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.080
I don't expect you to believe that.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.910
I've known you all your life
and I've yet to see you learn anything.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.914
With one exception, my dear.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.550
You embroider neatly.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.701
Morris.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:52.784
Morris!

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.999
- I haven't had a moment alone with her.
- Where is she?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.333
She's upstairs with Austin.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.339
They had a bad crossing,
and he's out of mood.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.115
You'd better leave.
I'll tell her everything later.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.926
No, I want to tell her myself.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.724
- I'll wait until he's gone to bed.
- No, no, please go.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.247
- If Austin should see you —
- He won't. I'll stay right here.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.807
No, no, you don't know.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.698
I'll take her shopping in the morning
and we'll meet you in the square.

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:24.193
Oh, please go.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.342
Morris.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.506
Morris! Morris!

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.314
Morris, I'm — I'm so glad.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.537
Cathy.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.329
You were waiting!
You were as anxious as I.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.201
Oh!

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:24.421
- Cathy.
- Oh, Morris.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.213
- Have you been true to me, Catherine?
- Oh, yes!

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:33.680
Yes. You've not changed your mind?

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.349
No, no! Have you?

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:39.519
- Oh, wait until you hear my plans.
- Plans?

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.605
Yes.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.099
For our marriage.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.559
Our elopement.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.190
Oh, our elopement!

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.277
It's for tomorrow night.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:53.923
In a country parsonage
up on Murray's Hill,

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:57.784
there's the Reverend Lispenard there
who knows our story, and he'll help us.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.495
Do you hear me, Catherine?

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:02.918
Oh, I love you so.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.801
Oh, tell me what to do.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.512
I have a closed carriage engaged.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:22.142
I will come to the corner of the square
tomorrow night at 9:00.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.473
We'll drive to the parsonage.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:29.232
And after the marriage, we'll spend
the night at an inn up the river.

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:33.694
The next day we'll go to Albany
on our honeymoon.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:35.859
Oh, Morris.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.412
My husband.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.083
- You like my plan?
- Oh.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:46.252
And I've brought you
such a beautiful silk waistcoat.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.922
- You must wear it for our wedding.
- My dear girl!

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:51.421
I bought you a set of buttons
at Barrere's in Paris.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.510
Buttons?

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.753
They are rubies and pearls.
They are quite nice.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:58.136
Oh, my dear, dear girl,
how happy we shall be.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.433
- Morris?
- Yes?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.769
- Take me tonight.
- Tonight?

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.906
- How can we?
- We must.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.984
In another hour, everyone will be asleep.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.536
We can get away quietly
and no one will know.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.740
But, Catherine, it's only one more day.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.665
Morris, I beg you.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.628
- Where would we go?
- To the Reverend Lisp...

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.297
- Lispenard?
- Yes! He knows about us.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.612
He will not turn us away
because we've come one day early.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.005
- I implore you!
- Catherine.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.511
If you love me...

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:45.016
- Very well, we'll do it.
- Oh!

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:51.351
I'll leave and find a carriage.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.027
See, it's almost 10:30.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:56.949
I can be back here at 12:30 on the dot
in front of the house.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.735
You must be ready and waiting for me.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.865
Can you do that?

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:03.830
Oh, I can do anything, my dearest.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:13.214
- You must leave a letter for your father.
- A letter?

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.839
- Yes. Shall I compose it for you?
- No.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:20.093
Well, you must think very carefully of how
to word it. You must melt his heart.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.300
- I will not write him.
- Of course you must write him.

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:26.683
- We want him to forgive us.
- He won't forgive us. I know it.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.515
I know it now. I have good reason to.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.019
What reason?

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.853
My father doesn't like me.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:35.779
What an unhappy thing to say.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.322
- Of course he does.
- No.

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:40.071
He must love you very much
or he wouldn't be trying so hard

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.447
to protect you from me.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.621
No, Morris, in this one thing
I know I am right.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.699
I couldn't say it unless I were sure.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:51.002
I — I understood it tonight
for the first time in my life.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.252
You can tell when a person speaks
to you as if... as if...

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:57.709
- As if what?
- As if they despised you.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.261
Despised?

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:04.432
We must be very happy together,
and you must never despise me, Morris.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.599
Oh, Catherine.

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:09.179
We must never ask him for anything
or depend upon him for anything.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:14.268
We must be very happy
and expect nothing from him ever.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.110
No.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.526
I will try to be
the best wife in the world.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.653
I know you will.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.826
I will get ready immediately.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:33.749
Catherine, dear.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.459
He can't dislike you that much.
He's bound to come round.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.007
No, Morris, he will not.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:44.465
But even if he would... I would not.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.141
I see.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:55.768
I will try to be punctual, Morris.
I know you like that.

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:59.738
- Till 12:30, then.
- Hurry, my darling.

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.642
- Catherine.
- Shh!

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:15.893
What are you doing?

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:18.044
Aunt, I would like it if you would please
go back to bed.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:19.900
But I want to know what you're doing.

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:24.906
- I am eloping with Morris.
- That's impossible. It's for tomorrow.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:28.156
- Hush.
- No, no, you've got everything wrong.

01:18:28.245 --> 01:18:30.487
Now, Morris will be here tomorrow evening.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:33.665
No, Aunt, he will be here
in the next two minutes.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.242
- Have you seen him?
- Yes.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:39.626
Oh, Catherine. Will you spend
the night with him unwed?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.879
We are going directly
to Reverend Lispenard's on Murray's Hill.

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:45.426
If he will marry us
perhaps we may stay with him.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:50.257
If not —
we will drive all night, I don't care.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:54.061
Oh, Catherine. How romantic.

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.308
Morris is so daring.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.189
I think I heard a carriage.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.069
No.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:03.603
Now, wouldn't you like me to dress quickly
and come with you?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:07.316
There's no time, Aunt.
Morris will be here any instant.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.446
But I think I should.
You must have a chaperone.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.277
Your father would be shocked.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:14.247
- It serves him right.
- What?

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:17.497
Father, he finds me so dull.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:21.250
It will surprise him to have
such a dull girl disgrace his name.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.879
Catherine, are you quite yourself?

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.551
No, it's just a shutter blowing.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:34.343
Think of it. I may never stand
in this window again.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:39.397
I may never see Washington Square
on a windy April night.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:41.732
Why won't you?

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:44.106
Because I will never be
in this house again.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:47.689
Nonsense. You and Austin
will be reconciled within the year.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.573
I will never see him again in my life.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:54.664
What?

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.824
I'm leaving tonight instead of tomorrow

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:01.787
because it is one time less
I will ever have to lay eyes on him,

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.246
or he on me.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.587
We dislike each other too much, Aunt.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:11.509
But good heavens, child.
You are disinheriting yourself.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:15.346
Yes. Completely.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:19.771
- Have you told Morris this?
- Of course. I told him everything.

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:23.476
- He is to be my husband.
- Oh, you should have waited.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:26.357
Did he... Did he understand?

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.274
There he is.

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:34.736
- Good-bye, Aunt. I will write to you, Aunt!
- Oh!

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.763
- Aunt?
- Yes, dear?

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.893
Why shouldn't I have told Morris?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.356
Oh, dear girl.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:54.323
Why were you not a little more clever?

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.493
Clever? About what?

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.659
Oh, Catherine.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:05.835
Why shouldn't I have told him?

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:15.425
Morris would not want to be the cause
of your losing your natural inheritance.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:20.008
He could not see you impoverished.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.684
Impoverished?

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.057
I have 10,000 a year.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:26.310
That is a great deal of money.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:34.856
Not when one has expected 30.

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.371
You think what my father thinks.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.708
Well, you are wrong. Morris loves me.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:49.291
I am everything
he ever yearned for in a woman.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.340
- Oh, Catherine.
- I am. I am. He has told me so.

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:55.548
He thinks I am pretty. He wants me.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.721
He could not wait for tomorrow night.
He said we must go tonight.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.884
No. I said that, didn't I?

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:05.061
But he agreed. He was willing.
You can see that for yourself.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:09.642
- He was very willing.
- Well, then, perhaps he will come.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.521
Perhaps?

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:14.608
He must come.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.198
He must take me away.

01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:19.617
He must love me. He must.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:22.070
Catherine, please, take hold of yourself.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.497
No, no. Morris must take hold of me.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.040
Morris will love me

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.618
for all those who didn't.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.659
Oh, don't worry...

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.833
Morris! Morris! Morris!

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:55.664
Morris! Morris! Morris! Morris!

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:59.466
Oh!

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:04.024
Oh, I'm sorry, the doctor's office is closed.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.154
Well, I heard he came back from Europe
a week ago.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.486
He did, but he's confined to his bed.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.822
Try Dr. Isaacs in Great Jones Street.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.202
Well, thank you.

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:20.673
Doctor. You shouldn't be up, sir.

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.500
Now, stop fluttering about.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.460
Doctor, please go back to bed.

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:27.297
You just go about your business, Maria.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:29.511
Yes, sir.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:37.439
Ah, Catherine.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.935
I haven't seen you since our return.

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:43.483
No, Father.

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:08.773
Of course, if he were ill,
he could not write.

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:14.867
Perhaps you should send him a brief note?

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:19.743
- No, Aunt.
- But I would gladly deliver it for you.

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:21.919
Stay out of it, Aunt.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.382
Oh, I want to help, if I can.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:30.716
Can you bring him back from California?

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:33.718
California?

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:40.480
I went to Mrs. Montgomery's to see him.

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.565
You did?

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:45.609
She told me.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:52.617
He borrowed the passage money
from his cousin Arthur... and left.

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:53.818
Oh.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.953
You had better go to your marketing.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:48.585
Oh. One-One moment, Maria.

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.166
Yes, Doctor?

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:54.880
If you will interrupt your embroidery
for a moment, Catherine.

01:29:56.016 --> 01:30:00.135
I... I think you both should know this.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:02.640
I am ill.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.650
It's not just a simple congestion.
There are rales in the lungs.

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.148
I shall need very good nursing.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:15.533
I shall not recover, but I wish
everything to be done as if I should.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:20.121
- I hate an ill-conducted sickroom.
- Well, maybe you will get well.

01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:22.994
Now, in a few days
you will need a doctor for me.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:24.996
Get Dr. Isaacs.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:30.252
If the street noises make me restless,
see the tanbark is put down.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:36.004
Catherine, I don't want your
Aunt Lavinia in my room at all.

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:39.807
Unless I should go into a coma.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:43.436
As for food, don't overload me, Maria.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.013
Keep me on soup. Beef broth and gruel.

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.473
Yes, sir.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.354
Find a small lamp.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.936
Put fresh wicks in it
so that it doesn't smell.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:55.649
- Doctor.
- Now, if you'll please make up my bed for me?

01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:58.655
- I'll be up in a moment.
- Yes.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.992
I will help you, Maria.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.075
Will you stay a minute, Catherine?

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:16.670
I can only assume
that your departure is imminent.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:22.092
Is it soon? This week?

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:24.853
No.

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:29.773
Has he asked you to keep your plans
secret from me?

01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:33.978
I am not leaving.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:39.074
- Not leaving?
- Will you excuse me, Father?

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.493
Come, come here a moment, Catherine.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.707
Here, in the light.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.668
You are flushed.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:52.296
Your eyes look sick.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.166
You've been weeping.

01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.883
You have broken your engagement.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:07.354
Oh, if you have, I must tell you,
Catherine, that I admire you greatly for it.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:10.560
I know the effort that you must have made.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:15.111
- Do you, Father?
- But in time, Catherine, the pain will pass.

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:19.232
I cannot begin to tell you
how proud of you I am.

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:23.653
- Are you?
- Oh, deeply. Most deeply proud.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:27.952
He deserted me.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.911
What?

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.997
Morris deserted me.

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:37.341
Now do you admire me, Father?

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:40.010
Oh, Catherine.

01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:43.218
Don't be kind to me.
It doesn't become you.

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:46.433
Catherine, are you blaming me
because I tried to protect you?

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.431
- Yes.
- Someday you'll realize

01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:50.763
I've done you a great service.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:54.316
I can tell you now what you have done.
You have cheated me.

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:58.612
You thought that any handsome, clever man
would be as bored with me as you were.

01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:01.406
It was not love that made you protect me,
it was contempt.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:04.156
Morris Townsend
did not love you, Catherine.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.658
I know that now, thanks to you.

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:09.286
Better to know it now than 20 years hence.

01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:14.040
Why? I lived with you for 20 years
before I found out you didn't love me.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:15.871
I don't know
that Morris would have hurt me

01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:18.048
or starved me for affection
more than you did.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:21.252
Since you couldn't love me,
you should have let someone else try.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:25.756
You have found a tongue at last, Catherine.

01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:29.636
It is only to say
such terrible things to me.

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:32.767
Yes. This is a field where
you will not compare me to my mother.

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.689
Should I have let him ruin your life?

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.314
You'll find some honest,
decent man someday.

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:39.065
You have many fine qualities.

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:41.192
- And 30,000 a year.
- Yes!

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:44.070
That should make it possible
for you to choose with discretion.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.903
If I am to buy a man,
I would prefer buying Morris.

01:33:46.996 --> 01:33:49.488
Don't say such things.

01:33:49.582 --> 01:33:51.824
You know him to be a scoundrel.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:56.204
I love him. Does that humiliate you?

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:58.289
Catherine!
Promise me you are done with him!

01:33:58.383 --> 01:33:59.590
I won't promise.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.793
Then I must alter my will.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.048
You should. You should do it immediately.

01:34:25.577 --> 01:34:28.911
"I, Austin Sloper,

01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:33.287
surgeon of 16 Washington Square —"

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:35.176
You had better tell me
how you wish it worded.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:37.791
I... I wish to consider more carefully.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.417
There is nothing to consider.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:42.170
You want your money used
for purposes you approve, don't you?

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.613
If you leave it to the clinic,
it will do what you want it to do.

01:34:44.637 --> 01:34:46.720
Catherine, I am ill.

01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:51.426
"... do hereby make
my last will and testament."

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.010
I don't want to do it.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:56.890
I don't want to disinherit my only child.

01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:58.519
I know that you don't.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:02.527
You'd like to think of me sitting
in dignity in this handsome house,

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:04.856
rich, respected, and unloved.

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:08.989
But I may take your money and chase
after Morris and squander it on him.

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:12.196
I don't know what you'll do, Catherine.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:14.740
That's right, Father.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.790
You'll never know... will you?

01:36:34.998 --> 01:36:36.159
Miss Catherine.

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:41.210
Dr. Isaacs said you'd better come now.
Your father is very low, miss.

01:36:44.257 --> 01:36:45.919
He wants you, miss.

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:48.758
I know he does.

01:36:51.514 --> 01:36:53.255
Too late, Maria.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:00.353
Yes, miss.

01:37:30.136 --> 01:37:33.254
- Tell Lavinia I'm sorry we missed her.
- I will, Aunt Elizabeth.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:36.307
- Come along, Mother, Arthur's waiting.
- All right, dear, I'm coming.

01:37:36.392 --> 01:37:38.054
Say good-bye to Aunt Catherine.

01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:40.978
- Good-bye, Aunt Catherine.
- Good-bye, Andrew.

01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:42.624
- Mother, you take Andrew.
- Bye, Aunt Catherine.

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.641
- Good-bye, honey.
- Sit here beside me, that's right.

01:37:45.735 --> 01:37:48.523
Why don't you come up this August?
You'd love Newport.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:50.980
And Jefferson and I
have taken a big house this year.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:52.315
Well, maybe I will.

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:55.151
We've asked you every year
since your father died.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:58.032
You always say, "Maybe I will."
And then you never do.

01:37:58.331 --> 01:37:59.822
I like the square.

01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:02.954
- Good-bye, Catherine.
- Good-bye.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:05.127
- Say good-bye, dear.
- Say good-bye, Andrew.

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:07.500
- Bye, Aunt Catherine!
- Good-bye.

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.797
Bye!

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:52.046
Oh, Miss Catherine. You've changed
into one of your Paris gowns.

01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:55.424
- You look very handsome in it.
- Thank you.

01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:58.847
It's such a hot night.

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:02.097
Would you mind if cook and I
took a stroll in the square?

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:06.851
Maria, you are as free
in this house as I am.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:10.560
When you want a small favor you need not
blandish me with false compliments.

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:13.111
But... But, Miss Catherine,

01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:15.359
I meant what I said.

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.158
It was the coolest dress I could find.

01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:20.778
Yes, miss.

01:39:31.757 --> 01:39:34.670
- Aunt Penniman, you're home quite early.
- Yes, dear. Yes.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.363
Did you see your friends
from Poughkeepsie?

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.424
Uh... Uh, no, dear, I did not.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:42.133
Now, Catherine, this will come to you
as a great surprise.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:43.888
Good, I like surprises.

01:39:45.771 --> 01:39:48.639
Well, then...

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:51.684
I have seen Morris Townsend.

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:56.487
Oh, we met quite by accident.

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:58.657
He's only been home a week.

01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:02.703
Oh! Catherine, he is so handsome.

01:40:02.788 --> 01:40:05.246
And he asked so many questions
about you, dear.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:09.668
He had heard that you hadn't married.
He seemed very interested in that.

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:15.549
He fears that you never understood him,
that you never judged him rightly.

01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:19.469
How can you say that to me?

01:40:19.555 --> 01:40:22.172
You were in this room
the night he deserted me.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.632
If you would hear him out,

01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:26.935
and if you would try to understand
his side of it, Catherine.

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:31.106
- He meant it nobly. Really, he did.
- I can hear that you have been with him.

01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:33.525
He has beguiled you again,
and you talk like a fool.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:35.728
I don't care what you think of me, dear.

01:40:35.821 --> 01:40:38.529
I am convinced that you will be happier
after you've seen him.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:42.868
Save your breath, Aunt Penniman.
I will not see him.

01:40:48.918 --> 01:40:51.285
Aunt Penniman, have you dared?

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:53.416
He walked home with me.

01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:55.998
He implored me to ask you.

01:40:56.092 --> 01:40:59.005
Oh, I only want your happiness, Catherine.

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:03.556
Go to the door, Aunt, and tell
Mr. Townsend that I am not at home.

01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:06.759
- Please, Catherine.
- I am not at home.

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:26.953
She is not at home, Morris.

01:41:27.707 --> 01:41:30.074
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

01:41:30.793 --> 01:41:32.785
Did you give her my message?

01:41:32.878 --> 01:41:35.495
Yes, but she is not at home.

01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:37.456
I see.

01:41:39.885 --> 01:41:42.377
It has been a long time
since I stood here.

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:44.212
I know.

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:47.926
Well... I'm sorry.

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:52.805
- Good night, Mrs. Penniman.
- Good-bye, Morris.

01:41:54.025 --> 01:41:55.561
Come in, Morris.

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:23.627
- Good evening, Morris.
- Good evening, Catherine.

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:26.221
Do I offend you by coming?

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:30.099
You should not have come.

01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:32.390
I had to.

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.222
I had to see you, Catherine.

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:39.226
May we not sit down?

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:41.937
I think we had better not.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.069
Can't we be friends again?

01:42:46.577 --> 01:42:48.284
We aren't enemies.

01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:52.831
You don't know how happy it makes me
to hear you say that.

01:42:55.628 --> 01:42:58.041
I've never ceased to think of you.

01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:00.087
Morris, if you cannot be honest with me,

01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:02.541
we shall have nothing more
to say to each other.

01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:03.751
But it's true, Catherine.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:06.962
Ever since... the night I left,

01:43:07.056 --> 01:43:10.549
it's been the desire of my life
that you should understand my motives.

01:43:10.893 --> 01:43:13.806
I have had years
to think about them, Morris.

01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:17.935
And I understand them.
So we have nothing further to discuss.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.561
I will bid you good night.

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.858
But I've come all the way
from California to see you.

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:26.402
To explain this to you.

01:43:26.492 --> 01:43:29.451
- It is late for explanations.
- No, Catherine.

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:31.870
I would have been back long since,

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:34.915
but I had to beg and borrow
the passage money.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.663
It's been a real struggle for me
to get back here.

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:41.042
Why, between New Orleans
and Charleston I worked as a hand,

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:42.498
a common seaman.

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:48.004
Now that I'm here, you will give me
the chance to vindicate myself.

01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:51.340
You must hear me out, Catherine.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.266
You must.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.642
For the sake of what we've been
to each other.

01:43:57.732 --> 01:43:59.940
What is it you want to explain?

01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:04.686
Many things, Catherine.

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.528
May we not sit down now?

01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:25.007
Catherine, it was because I loved you
that I disappeared that night.

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:30.796
Oh, I know how it looked.
It looked as if I behaved abominably.

01:44:32.558 --> 01:44:35.392
But I knew that if I returned that night,

01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:37.185
I might have done you great harm.

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:40.806
You know, my dear,
no man who really loves a woman

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:44.484
could ever permit her to give up
a great inheritance just for him.

01:44:45.237 --> 01:44:46.853
That's only in storybooks.

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:50.483
My father did not disinherit me, Morris.

01:44:50.576 --> 01:44:53.569
He threatened it to test you.

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:58.996
But I couldn't be sure of that
the night... I went away.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:01.959
No, you could not.

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:07.291
Try to understand me, Catherine.

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:11.382
Try not to think of...
what it looked like but of what it was.

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:13.509
I had to make a choice.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:16.387
I chose your welfare rather than my own.

01:45:17.269 --> 01:45:20.728
- Can you think of it that way?
- I will try.

01:45:22.775 --> 01:45:24.983
You know that I've never changed.

01:45:26.028 --> 01:45:30.318
I believe your nature is such
you will always care for me a little.

01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:34.777
Yes, Morris, that is true.

01:45:35.955 --> 01:45:40.575
Then, Catherine, will you forgive me
for the pain I caused you?

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:46.417
I forgave you a long time ago.

01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:52.711
Oh, Catherine, my dearest.

01:45:56.433 --> 01:46:00.302
We've only waited,
and now... now we're free.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:03.308
Nothing stands between us, Catherine.

01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.311
Do you mean you love me?

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:09.394
I didn't dare to say it.

01:46:09.488 --> 01:46:10.899
Why not?

01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:12.856
I wasn't sure you would believe me.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.072
I believed you once, didn't I?

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:21.744
Then, Catherine, let us make
the rest of life happy for each other.

01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:23.918
How?

01:46:24.545 --> 01:46:27.834
By... By picking up where we left off.

01:46:28.757 --> 01:46:30.248
By marrying, Catherine.

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:34.799
Would you like that, Morris?

01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:38.682
It would make me the proudest
and happiest man in the world.

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:40.599
And I will try and be
a good husband to you.

01:46:40.686 --> 01:46:43.099
I'm... I'm older, I'm wiser now.

01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:46.806
And I know that you love me.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.231
I need that.
I need it more than anything else.

01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:53.821
When would you like to marry me?

01:46:56.118 --> 01:46:57.450
Oh, Catherine.

01:47:00.289 --> 01:47:01.496
Then, you will.

01:47:02.499 --> 01:47:06.163
Let's... Let's marry soon.
Very soon. Next month.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:11.714
You are not as impetuous
as you used to be, Morris.

01:47:12.718 --> 01:47:14.004
Impetuous?

01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:18.597
Why... Why I would —
I would marry you tonight if I could.

01:47:19.516 --> 01:47:22.384
Come with me now,
we can find a carriage in the square.

01:47:22.478 --> 01:47:25.221
Do you think the Reverend Lispenard
is still waiting?

01:47:26.231 --> 01:47:27.893
We could tell him we were detained.

01:47:28.776 --> 01:47:34.113
Oh, Morris, I have thought so many
times of that inn up the river.

01:47:36.033 --> 01:47:37.399
My own dearest.

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:40.865
Shall we have the same honeymoon?

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.077
You must give me time to pack.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.252
Yes, of course.

01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:55.713
My things are at my sister's. I'll...

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:57.798
We'll pick them up on the way.

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:01.848
Why don't you get them now, Morris,
and come back for me?

01:48:01.934 --> 01:48:03.345
All right, I will.

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:07.057
We can be at Murray's Hill in an hour.
We can be there by 10:00.

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:12.809
Do you remember the buttons
I bought for you in Paris?

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:13.903
Buttons?

01:48:14.947 --> 01:48:18.031
Wait. I will get them.

01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:45.643
Oh!

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:49.846
I'm home.

01:48:50.482 --> 01:48:53.395
- Really, truly home.
- Oh! What, Morris? What?

01:48:53.485 --> 01:48:55.226
- She — She's magnificent.
- Yes.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.061
- She's superb.
- Yes.

01:48:57.156 --> 01:48:59.364
- She has such dignity now.
- Well, tell me.

01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:00.986
We're going to be married tonight.

01:49:01.326 --> 01:49:03.568
Tonight? Oh, Catherine.

01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:05.779
My dear girl.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.332
Here they are, Morris,

01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:11.454
your wedding present.

01:49:12.004 --> 01:49:13.245
Thank you, my darling.

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:20.548
Oh, Catherine, they're rubies.
Look, Mrs. Penniman.

01:49:20.637 --> 01:49:22.845
I've seen them. They sparkle so.

01:49:22.931 --> 01:49:25.890
- They suit you, Morris.
- Yes, they do.

01:49:26.518 --> 01:49:28.760
They're the most beautiful things
I've ever had.

01:49:36.445 --> 01:49:39.404
Catherine, you'll have no regrets.

01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:46.994
Till 9:00, then.

01:49:57.132 --> 01:50:01.001
Oh, Catherine, we have him back.

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:02.882
I knew it would turn out this way.

01:50:02.971 --> 01:50:07.261
You were not so sure as I,
but I have faith in love like this.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:10.139
Oh, I hope I always stay romantic.

01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:13.768
And you know, Catherine, you are much
more romantic than you think you are.

01:50:13.857 --> 01:50:15.723
Morris sensed that.

01:50:15.818 --> 01:50:18.401
Oh, don't bother about that, dear.
I'll do it.

01:50:18.487 --> 01:50:22.322
Oh, that beautiful Paris lingerie.
How fortunate that you kept it.

01:50:22.407 --> 01:50:27.493
I'm going to pack that for you.
I will sprinkle it with fresh lavender.

01:50:27.579 --> 01:50:29.992
Catherine, wouldn't you like me
to come with you?

01:50:30.082 --> 01:50:32.199
Oh, come, dear, we must pack.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:35.209
Catherine, you haven't time for that.

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:39.460
- There's not much left to do.
- But you can finish it afterwards.

01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:43.294
I must finish it now,
for I shall never do another.

01:50:44.012 --> 01:50:45.128
No?

01:50:49.017 --> 01:50:52.510
He came back with the same lies.

01:50:53.147 --> 01:50:56.060
The same silly phrases.

01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:58.938
What... What are you saying?

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:02.111
He has grown greedier with the years.

01:51:02.197 --> 01:51:05.065
The first time he only wanted my money.

01:51:05.159 --> 01:51:07.902
Now he wants my love, too.

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:13.950
Well, he came to the wrong house,
and he came twice.

01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:17.877
I shall see
that he never comes a third time.

01:51:17.963 --> 01:51:21.422
Catherine, do you know what you're doing?

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.628
Yes.

01:51:27.764 --> 01:51:29.471
Poor Morris.

01:51:31.727 --> 01:51:33.844
Can you be so cruel?

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:37.181
Yes, I can be very cruel.

01:51:38.275 --> 01:51:41.609
I have been taught by masters.

01:52:24.696 --> 01:52:25.732
Right here.

01:52:27.616 --> 01:52:28.732
Wait.

01:52:43.465 --> 01:52:45.707
I will attend to that. It's for me.

01:52:45.801 --> 01:52:47.258
Yes, miss.

01:52:54.518 --> 01:52:55.975
Bolt it, Maria.

01:52:57.145 --> 01:52:58.386
Bolt it?

01:52:59.273 --> 01:53:01.185
Bolt the door, Maria.

01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:03.436
Yes, miss.

01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:34.805
Good night, Maria.

01:53:38.103 --> 01:53:39.594
Good night, miss.

01:54:04.171 --> 01:54:05.378
Catherine!

01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:10.959
Catherine.

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:16.631
Catherine!

01:54:16.725 --> 01:54:18.091
Catherine.

01:54:26.485 --> 01:54:27.485
Catherine!

01:54:27.903 --> 01:54:29.815
Catherine!

01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:34.357
Catherine!

01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:37.201
Catherine!

01:54:37.287 --> 01:54:40.246
Catherine!

01:54:40.957 --> 01:54:43.574
Ca-Ca-Catherine! Catherine!

01:54:47.172 --> 01:54:48.172
Catherine!

01:54:52.511 --> 01:54:53.511
Catherine.
