00:15.006 --> 00:16.905
Whatcha doing?

00:16.973 --> 00:19.753
I'm attempting to view my work
as a fleeting peripheral image

00:19.821 --> 00:22.602
so as to engage the superior
colliculus of my brain.

00:25.856 --> 00:27.229
Interesting.

00:27.297 --> 00:29.109
I usually just have coffee.

00:29.951 --> 00:31.228
You've been up all night?

00:31.296 --> 00:32.238
Is it morning?

00:32.305 --> 00:33.249
Yes.

00:33.317 --> 00:34.825
Then I've been up all night.

00:37.276 --> 00:38.792
And you're stuck?

00:38.859 --> 00:40.536
Why else would a person
try to engage

00:40.605 --> 00:42.690
their superior colliculus?

00:42.757 --> 00:46.754
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help
you till I've had my coffee.

00:54.043 --> 00:57.198
Penny, I told you if you don't
put him in his crate at night

00:57.266 --> 00:59.247
he just runs around
the apartment.

01:01.230 --> 01:03.914
What is he doing now?

01:03.982 --> 01:06.265
LEONARD: Hmm, he's
either isolating the terms

01:06.333 --> 01:10.193
of his formula and examining
them individually,

01:10.261 --> 01:11.670
or...

01:11.739 --> 01:13.985
looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand

01:14.054 --> 01:16.099
after Peter Pan cut it off.

01:16.168 --> 01:18.818
Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile,

01:18.886 --> 01:20.529
not an alligator.

01:20.598 --> 01:25.094
If you're going to mock me, at
least get your facts straight.

01:25.161 --> 01:28.315
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:28.383 --> 01:30.429
I can't see it!

01:30.497 --> 01:31.939
It just won't coalesce.

01:32.007 --> 01:33.684
Maybe you need
a fresh start.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.832
You're right.

01:43.653 --> 01:45.801
(tires squealing
and car horns honking)

01:47.145 --> 01:49.761
It's a great idea, Leonard.
Thank you.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.424
Electrons move
through graphene...

02:18.715 --> 02:21.063
act as if they
have no mass...

02:23.145 --> 02:24.688
How long has
he been stuck?

02:24.756 --> 02:26.970
Intellectually about 30 hours.

02:27.038 --> 02:28.883
Emotionally about 29 years.

02:28.951 --> 02:32.508
Unit cell contains
two carbon atoms...

02:32.575 --> 02:35.829
Interior angle
of a hexagon is 120 degrees.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.233
Have you tried
rebooting him?

02:41.301 --> 02:43.515
(chuckles)

02:43.583 --> 02:44.622
(laughing)

02:44.690 --> 02:47.977
No, I think it's
a firmware problem.

02:48.045 --> 02:51.031
Hey, it's Disco Night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink

02:51.098 --> 02:52.339
in Glendale tonight.

02:52.408 --> 02:54.655
Who's up for getting down?

02:54.723 --> 02:56.299
That's perfect.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.949
Bernadette's been hocking me
to take her roller skating.

02:59.018 --> 03:00.392
I think Penny likes to skate.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.801
The four of us could double.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.345
What could be better?
We're in.

03:03.413 --> 03:06.835
Great. It's not like I brought
it up because I wanted to go.

03:09.654 --> 03:11.499
You can come with us.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.110
No, it's okay.
I don't have to go.

03:13.178 --> 03:14.821
I'm happy just to guide
you and your ladies

03:14.889 --> 03:16.532
to suitable
entertainment choices.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.217
I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.

03:20.829 --> 03:24.183
Structure, constant
structure. One atom...

03:24.251 --> 03:26.565
Boy, he's really gone,
isn't he?

03:26.634 --> 03:29.989
Yeah, this morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

03:30.057 --> 03:33.411
I thought I smelled popcorn.

03:36.534 --> 03:37.841
Pattern is the same
as fermions...

03:37.909 --> 03:38.948
Travels on
the pathways...

03:39.016 --> 03:40.324
Hexagonal...
It's always hexagonal...

03:40.392 --> 03:43.344
I haven't seen him this stuck
since he tried to figure out

03:43.412 --> 03:44.686
<i>the third Matrix movie.</i>

03:44.755 --> 03:46.398
(gasps)

03:47.304 --> 03:49.685
Hey, those are my lima beans!

03:49.754 --> 03:53.210
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

03:53.279 --> 03:54.955
But if I don't eat
my lima beans,

03:55.023 --> 03:56.632
I can't have my cookie.

03:56.701 --> 03:58.176
Here, you want my peas?

03:58.245 --> 03:59.384
The peas- perfect.

03:59.452 --> 04:00.861
They can be electrons.

04:00.929 --> 04:02.136
Want my corn?

04:02.204 --> 04:04.384
Don't be ridiculous.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.169
What would I do with corn?

04:07.237 --> 04:11.095
So roller skating
- should we all grab a bite to eat first?

04:11.163 --> 04:12.604
Good. P.F. Chang's?

04:12.673 --> 04:13.980
My mom has coupons.

04:14.048 --> 04:15.189
Great.

04:15.257 --> 04:17.267
Your mom's not
coming, right?

04:17.337 --> 04:20.892
Not this time, I promise.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.007
Okay, just to be clear,
roller skating was my idea,

04:23.074 --> 04:25.791
and I'm very unhappy that you
turned it into a double date,

04:25.860 --> 04:27.973
and I hope you both fall
on your asses

04:28.041 --> 04:29.348
and break your coccyxes.

04:31.698 --> 04:35.052
The plural of coccyx
is coccyges.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.837
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

04:40.422 --> 04:41.494
Oh, my God.

04:41.562 --> 04:43.138
Have you ever
been so embarrassed?

04:43.206 --> 04:44.380
Not recently.

04:44.448 --> 04:46.024
I don't know
which was lamer:

04:46.092 --> 04:48.306
their roller-skating
or their disco dancing.

04:48.374 --> 04:50.151
For me, the worst part

04:50.220 --> 04:53.540
was when people
saw us leave with them.

04:53.609 --> 04:57.668
You had some nice moves
out there, Howard.

04:57.736 --> 04:58.843
Thanks. You, too.
Yeah.

04:58.910 --> 05:01.058
Did you notice all the
people looking at us?

05:02.334 --> 05:05.252
Not really. I was
in my boogie zone.

05:07.535 --> 05:09.615
When Howard tried
to do the splits...

05:09.682 --> 05:10.755
Shh.

05:10.823 --> 05:12.231
Sorry. I'm moving
a little slow.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.110
I think I bruised
my coccyx.

05:14.178 --> 05:15.519
Oh, poor baby.

05:15.587 --> 05:17.466
Don't tell Koothrappali.

05:17.533 --> 05:18.975
After you.

05:19.043 --> 05:20.350
Oh, what a gentleman.

05:20.418 --> 05:21.826
Hey, Sheldon.

05:21.895 --> 05:23.873
(screams) LEONARD: Oh, my God!

05:23.941 --> 05:25.115
Are you...

05:26.122 --> 05:27.497
SHELDON:
Good Lord!

05:27.565 --> 05:28.570
You're ruining everything!

05:28.638 --> 05:29.778
Oh, damn.

05:29.846 --> 05:30.918
Are you okay?

05:30.987 --> 05:32.261
Do I look okay?

05:32.329 --> 05:34.307
Don't bark at me.
I fell, too.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.186
Oh, you've been falling
all night. You're used to it.

05:38.201 --> 05:40.011
Sheldon, what the
hell are you doing?

05:40.080 --> 05:41.891
The same thing I've been doing
for three days.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.401
Trying to figure out
why electrons

05:43.469 --> 05:45.179
behave as if they have no mass

05:45.248 --> 05:46.957
when traveling
through a graphene sheet.

05:47.026 --> 05:48.166
With marbles?

05:48.234 --> 05:49.509
Well, I needed something bigger

05:49.576 --> 05:51.656
than peas, now, didn't I?

05:51.724 --> 05:55.280
Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

05:55.349 --> 05:56.522
I don't know- two, three days.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.763
Not important.

05:57.832 --> 06:00.147
I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

06:00.214 --> 06:01.791
I need to determine where

06:01.858 --> 06:04.710
in this swamp
of unbalanced formulas

06:04.778 --> 06:08.334
squatteth the toad of truth.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.844
Toad of truth?

06:09.911 --> 06:11.689
Is that a physics thing?

06:11.758 --> 06:14.408
No, that's a
crazy thing.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.253
Okay, Sheldon.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.803
What happens
to our neuroreceptors

06:18.871 --> 06:21.420
when we don't get
enough REM sleep?

06:22.965 --> 06:26.453
They lose their sensitivity
to serotonin and norepinephrine.

06:26.522 --> 06:27.662
Which leads to...?

06:27.730 --> 06:30.648
Impaired cognitive function.

06:30.715 --> 06:34.975
Right, so march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

06:35.044 --> 06:38.600
But I don't want to go to bed.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.989
I'm going to count
to three. One...

06:42.056 --> 06:43.767
Oh, all right.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.209
That was amazing
how you handled him.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.389
I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

06:52.458 --> 06:55.979
My mother used to run an illegal
day care center in our basement.

07:02.053 --> 07:04.469
(evil laughter)

07:08.932 --> 07:12.388
Leonard, you're... you're
giggling in your sleep.

07:12.455 --> 07:13.696
It's not me.

07:13.763 --> 07:15.408
It's my new ringtone.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.058
<i>The Joker from Batman.</i>

07:18.127 --> 07:20.441
Well, it creeps me out.

07:20.509 --> 07:23.898
Me, too, but I paid
three bucks for it.

07:23.966 --> 07:25.442
Just answer the phone.

07:25.509 --> 07:27.489
(sighs)

07:30.242 --> 07:32.020
Hello.

07:33.296 --> 07:35.409
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

07:36.919 --> 07:38.495
Yeah, yeah, he's my roommate.

07:39.839 --> 07:42.085
Oh, God, is he okay?

07:43.865 --> 07:45.576
Yeah, all-all right.
I'll be right there.

07:45.644 --> 07:47.253
What happened?

07:47.322 --> 07:50.810
Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.534
Okay. Have fun.

07:58.059 --> 07:59.836
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

07:59.905 --> 08:01.882
Where is he?
Ball pit.

08:04.802 --> 08:07.016
Thanks for not
calling the cops.

08:07.084 --> 08:08.626
Oh, hey, it's
no big deal.

08:08.694 --> 08:10.874
My sister's got a kid
who's special.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.471
Yeah, well,
he's extra special.

08:17.184 --> 08:18.323
Hey, Shelly.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.874
What you doing?

08:20.942 --> 08:22.384
Size ratio was all wrong.

08:22.452 --> 08:23.726
Couldn't visualize it.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.873
Needed bigger carbon atoms.

08:26.915 --> 08:28.928
Sure, sure.

08:30.137 --> 08:32.216
How did you get
into this place?

08:32.284 --> 08:34.833
Back door has a five-pin
tumbler system,

08:34.902 --> 08:36.780
single-circuit alarm.
Child's play.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.109
You can start sorting protons
and neutrons

08:41.177 --> 08:43.190
while I build carbon atoms.

08:43.258 --> 08:44.566
No, I don't think so.

08:44.634 --> 08:46.177
We need to go home now.

08:46.245 --> 08:48.425
But I'm still working.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.137
If you don't come out of there,

08:50.205 --> 08:52.083
I'm going to have
to drag you out.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.941
You can try,
but you'll never catch me.

08:59.534 --> 09:02.149
For God's sakes.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.859
Sheldon, come here!

09:08.927 --> 09:11.241
Bazinga.

09:13.557 --> 09:18.088
Bazinga.

09:19.129 --> 09:23.122
Bazinga.

09:30.172 --> 09:31.479
<i>OF GAIN DET(whispering):

09:31.548 --> 09:32.788
Leonard and Penny.
(screams)

09:32.856 --> 09:34.700
What?
What, what, what?

09:39.433 --> 09:41.378
Leonard and Penny.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.391
What?

09:43.460 --> 09:45.203
I have good news.
LEONARD: And you had

09:45.272 --> 09:46.781
to barge in here
and wake us up

09:46.850 --> 09:47.923
in the middle
of the night?

09:47.990 --> 09:49.600
Your cell phone was off.

09:49.668 --> 09:52.084
Because we didn't want
to be disturbed.

09:52.151 --> 09:55.104
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

09:55.172 --> 09:58.158
Sheldon, what
do you want?

09:58.226 --> 10:00.944
I came to tell you
I've got the answer.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.722
Really?

10:02.790 --> 10:05.171
You figured out
the graphene problem?

10:05.239 --> 10:07.319
No, no, I'm still
hopelessly stuck on that,

10:07.386 --> 10:10.539
but I figured out
how to figure it out.

10:10.607 --> 10:12.217
Okay, you know what,
Leonard, I know I said

10:12.284 --> 10:13.794
I could handle your roommate,
but I was wrong.

10:13.862 --> 10:15.136
We're going to
have to break up.

10:16.177 --> 10:18.290
What are you
talking about?

10:18.358 --> 10:20.269
(clears throat)
Oh. (sighs)

10:22.317 --> 10:23.490
Einstein.

10:23.559 --> 10:26.544
Yeah, I'm going to need
a little more.

10:26.612 --> 10:28.994
Albert Einstein.

10:31.378 --> 10:33.659
Keep going.

10:33.727 --> 10:36.042
When Albert Einstein came up
with special relativity,

10:36.109 --> 10:38.256
he was working at
the patent office.

10:38.325 --> 10:40.874
So, you're going to go work
at the patent office?

10:40.943 --> 10:42.451
Don't be absurd.

10:42.519 --> 10:43.927
That's in Washington.

10:43.996 --> 10:46.310
You know I could never live
in a city whose streets

10:46.378 --> 10:48.289
are laid out in a
wheel-and-spoke pattern.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.202
No. I'm going to find

10:50.270 --> 10:51.879
a similarly menial job

10:51.947 --> 10:54.999
where my basal ganglia are
occupied with a routine task,

10:55.067 --> 10:56.609
freeing my prefrontal cortex

10:56.677 --> 10:59.025
to work quietly in the
background on my problem.

11:00.402 --> 11:01.541
Sounds like a great plan.

11:01.610 --> 11:02.682
Of course it is.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.024
Even talking to you is

11:04.093 --> 11:05.635
sufficiently menial
that I can feel

11:05.704 --> 11:07.280
the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

11:07.348 --> 11:10.065
Okay, well, thanks
for sharing with us.

11:10.134 --> 11:11.912
Good night.
You're welcome.

11:11.979 --> 11:13.623
And good night to you, too.

11:13.692 --> 11:15.099
(sighs)

11:15.168 --> 11:17.953
Oh, by the way, I was
watching you sleep for a moment,

11:18.020 --> 11:19.361
and I noticed that your snoring

11:19.430 --> 11:21.510
seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

11:21.578 --> 11:23.490
Leonard doesn't snore.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.207
No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.670
Told you.

11:32.047 --> 11:35.736
So, Mr. Cooper, you're
looking for a job.

11:35.805 --> 11:38.051
A menial job.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.964
Like yours.

11:42.045 --> 11:44.326
Why, thank you for noticing.

11:45.535 --> 11:48.352
I'm "Menial Employee
of the Month."

11:49.561 --> 11:51.909
Do you have
a particular field in mind?

11:51.978 --> 11:53.218
I do.

11:53.286 --> 11:55.030
For thousands of years,

11:55.098 --> 11:56.909
the lowest classes
of the human race

11:56.977 --> 11:59.493
have spent their lives laboring
to erect monuments

11:59.561 --> 12:01.406
under the lash of their betters,

12:01.474 --> 12:02.613
until finally,

12:02.682 --> 12:04.022
they dropped down

12:04.091 --> 12:07.681
and became one with the dust
through which they trudged.

12:07.749 --> 12:10.164
Do you have anything like that?

12:11.675 --> 12:13.487
No.

12:13.555 --> 12:15.635
Shouldn't you check
your database?

12:17.951 --> 12:19.594
No.

12:22.381 --> 12:25.064
You didn't really type?

12:25.132 --> 12:28.419
I didn't really have to.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.465
So, how about
construction?

12:30.533 --> 12:32.412
Oh, that would be good!

12:32.479 --> 12:35.834
Sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail

12:35.902 --> 12:38.115
as my working-class
fellows and I

12:38.183 --> 12:40.229
sit perched precariously
on a girder

12:40.297 --> 12:42.343
high above the metropolis.

12:42.411 --> 12:45.799
No, no. This is
putting up sheetrock

12:45.868 --> 12:48.887
at a housing project
in Rosemead.

12:48.955 --> 12:50.397
I could do that.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.840
Good.
One question.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.424
Yes?
What's sheetrock?

12:54.492 --> 12:56.337
Moving on.

12:57.513 --> 12:58.619
How about

12:58.688 --> 13:00.466
doing deliveries for a florist?

13:00.534 --> 13:02.143
That seems acceptable.

13:02.211 --> 13:05.062
Do you have your own car?
I don't drive.

13:05.131 --> 13:07.277
Of course you don't.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.506
Mr. Cooper, let me
just ask you a question.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.216
What was your last job?

13:13.285 --> 13:15.767
Senior theoretical
particle physicist at CalTech,

13:15.835 --> 13:19.491
focusing on M theory, or, in
layman's terms, string theory.

13:19.559 --> 13:21.572
I see.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.585
Just give me a second.

13:27.478 --> 13:29.826
Security!

13:35.262 --> 13:38.616
Okay, I'll get those drinks
started for you.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.697
Behind you.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.951
Sheldon, what the hell
are you doing?

13:44.019 --> 13:46.099
I'm trying to get
these tables cleared.

13:46.167 --> 13:46.971
We're slammed.

13:48.013 --> 13:49.555
No, wait, wait,
no, wait.

13:49.623 --> 13:51.401
<i>Wh-What are you
doing here?</i>

13:51.469 --> 13:53.246
A reasonable question.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.729
I asked myself, what is
the most mind-numbing,

13:55.798 --> 13:57.642
pedestrian job conceivable,

13:57.710 --> 13:59.689
and three answers came to mind:

13:59.758 --> 14:02.474
uh, toll booth attendant,
Apple Store genius...

14:04.288 --> 14:06.233
...and what Penny does.

14:06.302 --> 14:07.408
Now...

14:07.476 --> 14:09.455
since I don't like

14:09.524 --> 14:10.932
touching other people's coins,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.643
and I refuse to contribute

14:12.711 --> 14:15.327
to the devaluation
of the word "genius,"

14:15.396 --> 14:17.241
here I am.

14:17.308 --> 14:20.495
You just, you just walked in
and they hired you,

14:20.564 --> 14:21.536
just like that?

14:21.604 --> 14:23.146
Oh, heavens, no.

14:23.215 --> 14:25.662
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.441
I simply came in,
picked up a tray,

14:27.510 --> 14:30.292
and started
"working for the man."

14:30.361 --> 14:30.427
Let me get that plate
out of your way.

14:32.508 --> 14:33.446
Sheldon,

14:33.515 --> 14:34.688
this is ridiculous.

14:34.755 --> 14:35.761
Is it?

14:35.830 --> 14:37.405
Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany

14:37.474 --> 14:39.653
regarding the polymer
degradation phenomenon

14:39.721 --> 14:42.304
while scraping
congealed nachos off a plate.

14:42.372 --> 14:44.854
Bernadette, table 10
wants their check.

14:44.923 --> 14:45.861
Thanks, Sheldon.

14:45.929 --> 14:46.868
Sheldon,

14:46.936 --> 14:48.075
wait, this isn't even what I do.

14:48.144 --> 14:50.022
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

14:50.091 --> 14:52.640
You're right.
That is more menial.

14:52.708 --> 14:56.465
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

14:57.574 --> 14:59.151
I don't recommend the salmon.

14:59.219 --> 15:01.534
I saw it in the kitchen.

15:04.085 --> 15:07.775
All right,
one bacon cheeseburger,

15:07.843 --> 15:11.700
breaking two Jewish dietary
restrictions simultaneously-

15:11.768 --> 15:13.748
kudos.

15:13.815 --> 15:15.860
Beer-battered
fish and chips.

15:15.929 --> 15:17.874
Now, here's your
tartar sauce.

15:17.942 --> 15:19.451
I also brought you salsa.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.229
It's a little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it.

15:21.297 --> 15:22.940
It's zingy.

15:24.014 --> 15:26.865
And for you, Factory
Burrito Grande-

15:26.934 --> 15:28.711
no cheese,
no sour cream,

15:28.779 --> 15:31.832
no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

15:32.773 --> 15:34.785
Bon appÃ©tit.

15:34.853 --> 15:36.900
Hang on.

15:36.968 --> 15:37.941
Black beans, not pinto beans?

15:38.008 --> 15:38.947
Yes.

15:39.015 --> 15:40.256
Double guacamole?
Of course.

15:40.324 --> 15:41.430
No cilantro?
Nope.

15:41.499 --> 15:43.041
Lettuce shredded,
not chopped? Yep.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.282
You understand
why I'm doing this to you?

15:44.351 --> 15:46.162
I do.
That'll be all.

15:48.175 --> 15:50.322
That was fun.

15:50.390 --> 15:52.435
(laughter)

15:52.503 --> 15:54.449
How long can he keep this up?

15:54.517 --> 15:56.227
I heard about this
professor at MIT

15:56.296 --> 15:57.636
who melted down,
bought a van,

15:57.705 --> 16:00.320
and spent the rest of his life
as a mobile dog groomer.

16:00.389 --> 16:02.166
He never went back
to the university?

16:02.234 --> 16:05.387
Only to shampoo Professor
Shamburg's shih tzu.

16:06.428 --> 16:09.615
Sheesh.

16:09.683 --> 16:09.749
I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

16:13.978 --> 16:15.588
But he's afraid of dogs.

16:15.657 --> 16:18.306
Yeah, that's the only thing
wrong with that plan.

16:19.751 --> 16:23.340
Hey, guys, sorry you had
to wait, but we are swamped.

16:23.408 --> 16:24.716
What's this?

16:24.785 --> 16:26.494
Sheldon took our order.

16:26.563 --> 16:29.011
Sheldon doesn't work here.

16:29.079 --> 16:31.292
Well, honey, not to complain,

16:31.361 --> 16:34.213
but we were starting
to think you didn't either.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.589
(crashing)

16:36.630 --> 16:39.280
Is that really necessary?

16:40.523 --> 16:43.676
Good Lord.

16:43.744 --> 16:45.991
The interference pattern
in the fracture.

16:46.058 --> 16:47.467
The motion
of the wave

16:47.535 --> 16:49.211
through the molecular structure.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.427
I've been looking
at it all wrong.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.908
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

16:53.977 --> 16:56.291
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

16:57.366 --> 17:00.216
It's a wave!

17:02.263 --> 17:04.981
The moment to applaud
would be now.

17:05.987 --> 17:08.704
Troglodytes.

17:09.712 --> 17:10.818
Sheldon... where are you going?

17:10.887 --> 17:12.799
Aren't you going
to clean this up?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.878
I'm sorry. I don't work here.
