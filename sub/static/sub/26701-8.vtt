WEBVTT

01:15.909 --> 01:17.994
We really messed up the old house,
didn't we?

01:31.216 --> 01:34.511
So much like the engines and things
we saw under Gresit.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.680
Alucard must have learned it all
at his daddy's knee.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.478
-It's incredible, really.
-It's the true science.

01:43.937 --> 01:48.066
My people heard the stories, but didn't
quite hold on to the truth of them.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.777
Less damage than I would have thought.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.988
Apart from the mess
in that little room he showed us.

01:54.072 --> 01:54.906
Yes.

01:55.490 --> 02:00.245
The engine room that moves the castle.
I cannot imagine how that worked.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.456
Well, it doesn't work anymore.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.794
-You melted it.
-I didn't melt anything.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.005
It must've been
straining against the spell.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.769
-What do you think he's going to do now?
-I had a plan, you know.

02:27.272 --> 02:31.276
I was going back to Gresit...
return to my vault...

02:32.485 --> 02:33.695
go back to sleep.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.864
But?

02:36.656 --> 02:41.119
If I leave the castle here...
all his work is inside it.

02:41.911 --> 02:45.290
His libraries, his materials,
his knowledge.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.294
What happens to all that
if the structure is abandoned?

02:50.503 --> 02:55.049
I can't just leave it here.
It'd be nothing but a grave to be robbed.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.765
So... let it be my grave.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.019
No.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.688
No?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.275
No. We can't move this thing.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.403
-Sypha broke it.
-I did not.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.448
-You kind of did.
-I do not break things.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.326
-So, we agreed she broke it.
-Oh, yes.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.996
So, it's staying right here, forever.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.583
Right on top of the Belmont Hold,

03:29.459 --> 03:32.086
which is now also open to the world.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.383
Up here,
your father's collected knowledge.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.472
Down there, the collected knowledge
of your mother's people.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.892
As above, so below.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.062
Both halves of you, Alucard.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.231
I'm listening.

03:53.441 --> 03:58.571
Behold, you sulky half-vampire bastard.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.699
I bequeath you the Belmont Hold.

04:02.784 --> 04:07.288
Make that and the castle your home,
not your grave.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.916
Be its last defender.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.878
You're giving me your home?

04:15.421 --> 04:16.256
It's yours.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.842
My childhood home and your childhood home.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.596
Protect it. Make something out of it.

04:24.430 --> 04:28.309
Something better than a pile of ruins
and a symbol of terror.

05:14.939 --> 05:15.982
Keep moving.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.817
I'm not in the mood.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.784
What do we have here?

05:29.537 --> 05:31.539
It's thirsty, whatever it is.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.793
Don't drink the entire pool.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.589
There is enough water for all.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.885
Oh, I don't care about all.
I only care about us.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.765
There will be plenty for you
after I'm gone.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.559
But perhaps we want it all.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.855
Yes. You probably do.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.983
Your kind always does.

06:00.485 --> 06:04.030
I think the desert has left us
a little gift, don't you?

06:05.990 --> 06:10.870
Put a rope around it. Drag it behind us.
Perhaps we can sell it at the next town.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.791
Unless we get hungry
between now and then, I suppose.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.377
Is that really the best you have?

06:19.087 --> 06:23.508
Your best response to finding
a lone stranger drinking at an oasis.

06:24.258 --> 06:29.013
Call him "it," and immediately draw plans
to sell him or eat him.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.559
You don't matter.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.687
You don't deserve my best.

06:37.855 --> 06:42.026
You're just some drifting clump of shit
I discovered on the road,

06:42.401 --> 06:45.071
and I'll do with you as I wish.

06:46.155 --> 06:51.035
Only I and my friends here matter.
You are simply meat.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.038
I'm not human?

06:55.164 --> 07:00.128
Oh, I'm sure you're human,
Sir Philosopher of the Water Hole.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.381
I simply don't care.

07:05.424 --> 07:06.259
Me neither.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.319
I simply don't have time
to deal with shit like you

09:30.403 --> 09:32.905
every time I want to sit and take a drink.

09:35.032 --> 09:39.620
And I am a forgemaster,
so, I don't need to.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.168
I could have an army of my own.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.799
I might like an army.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.036
Shall we find some more people
to add to our merry band?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.562
I want to rejoin my caravan.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.608
This is a story that should be read
into our memory stores.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.570
But after that? I don't know.

11:37.696 --> 11:41.659
You'll travel with them, surely.
Go back to your old life.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.539
I don't know.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.211
Since I met you,
I've come back from a living death.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.840
I've fought demons
in the city square at Gresit.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.260
I've stopped a raiding force
from reaching Arges.

11:59.343 --> 12:03.264
I've discovered forgotten spells
in the greatest hidden library in Europe.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.975
And I've trapped a castle

12:06.058 --> 12:09.061
that uses magic engines
to move from place to place

12:09.145 --> 12:11.856
and pinned it to the ruins
of the Belmont home.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.858
Why would I want to stop now?

12:15.526 --> 12:16.360
Go on.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.282
Look, we know at least some
of Dracula's army landed at Braila.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.411
-Are the night hordes going to go home?
-Well, no, but--

12:25.494 --> 12:29.790
And what about the church? We've both seen
how corrupt and twisted it is.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.586
And who knows what else is happening
out there? What then?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.921
Well, what then?

12:36.005 --> 12:40.551
Then we're not finished, are we?
And I don't want to stop.

12:41.135 --> 12:45.055
-Stop what, for God's sake?
-This. What we're doing.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.601
-And it's good for you, too.
-Okay.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.981
How on Earth did you come
to that decision?

12:54.064 --> 12:59.028
When I met you,
you reeked of piss, blood, and stale beer.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.864
You killed a monster largely by accident.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.200
Hey, that took serious skills.

13:04.283 --> 13:09.288
Then demanded alcohol before storming off
like a toddler with a thistle up his back.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.040
Right. How does that even--?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.752
And now, in the short time
we have known each other,

13:15.461 --> 13:18.297
you have rediscovered yourself,
and you've grown.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.134
Today might be the first time I felt like
I was talking to an adult man.

13:23.052 --> 13:27.306
You're better than you were when we met.
Do you know why I think that is?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.352
It's because you're doing
what you were born for.

13:31.894 --> 13:37.191
As insane as it sounds, this entire
nightmare scenario has made you complete.

13:38.275 --> 13:41.445
I think you should see it through.
With me.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.405
With you.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.575
Yes. You could be my handsome sidekick.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.246
Or mascot. Imagine that.
If you didn't talk much,

13:50.329 --> 13:53.749
people would think you were my
deformed pet bear and throw you free food.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.712
-Sypha.
-Yes, Trevor?

14:01.340 --> 14:06.053
You're asking me to roam the countryside
and get into horrible trouble

14:06.512 --> 14:09.557
because you think it's good for me?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.811
Listen to what I'm really saying, Trevor.

14:14.353 --> 14:19.400
I'm saying I want you to be with me,
and I want you to have adventures with me.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.238
This is the closest thing I've had
to a life in...

14:26.115 --> 14:27.199
I don't know when.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.412
And you're the closest I've had
to a friend.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.458
So, will you come with me?

14:40.838 --> 14:44.884
I wouldn't know where else to go.
Or who else to be with.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.305
Good.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.769
Where to first?

14:57.229 --> 15:00.608
After we find my people?
I think we should see Braila.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.490
But let's stay here just a little longer.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.388
-Is the sun down yet?
-Not quite.

15:33.557 --> 15:37.311
For God's sake.
Where are the townspeople?

15:38.187 --> 15:39.605
They're not coming close to us.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.650
They spent the day
recovering things from the ruins.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.945
They started returning
to the furthest houses a while ago.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.322
Do they know we're here?

15:49.990 --> 15:50.824
Certainly.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.996
So, they're barricading their homes
and sharpening their stakes.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.208
That's fair. Can't say I blame them.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.925
You won't stake me to death
with that, Hector.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.013
I wasn't intending to try.

16:13.555 --> 16:18.143
I was thinking it might make a drill
to start a fire. It will be a cold night.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.771
We won't be staying.

16:21.605 --> 16:25.943
The fire was for me, not you.
I assume you don't really feel the cold.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.140
Where will you go?

16:56.724 --> 16:59.977
I think I will return to Styria.
What else is there?

17:00.519 --> 17:04.231
The majority of my forces were here,
and now they are gone.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.986
What was that? The way the castle moved
and then vanished.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.573
I've been thinking about it all day.
I still don't understand.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.662
What is there to understand?
A spell captured the castle.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.874
The engines of the castle
attempted to fight the capture,

17:21.957 --> 17:25.544
and so it thrashed around
like a rat in a cage and lost.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.842
-Do you think Dracula lives?
-No.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.803
We have viewed the castle with mirrors.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.680
But you can't be sure.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.266
I can. Dracula is dead, Hector.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.731
-Does that trouble you?
-Of course it does.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.069
Poor Hector. Stand up for me.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.412
Hector... you look like shit.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.540
I know.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.460
Don't worry. We'll look after you.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.510
Carmilla. What are you doing?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.721
I must return to Styria.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.725
With my forces decimated,
the humans of this region weakened,

18:21.809 --> 18:24.770
and the void in the power structure
of the vampire world,

18:24.853 --> 18:27.064
I intend to take advantage of that.

18:27.648 --> 18:31.693
But I need my strength returned.
I need a horde as Dracula had.

18:32.194 --> 18:36.448
And you are a forgemaster.
You will create the horde for me.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.366
Go to hell.

18:56.927 --> 18:57.761
Get up.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.713
You are my pet now.
My pet forgemaster.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.527
Good pet.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.073
To Styria.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.813
Be well, my friend.

21:18.568 --> 21:22.823
You, too. Don't let that idiot
get you into too much trouble.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.324
Never.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.707
Well, maybe just enough trouble.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.125
Just enough.

21:49.141 --> 21:49.975
Fuck you.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.143
Come on, boy.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.227
Belnades and Belmont.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.899
-That sounds quite good, doesn't it?
-Not bad.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.319
Belnades and Belmont.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.406
For when I tell the story.
For the legend.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.659
Wait, I don't get first billing?

22:51.244 --> 22:54.790
Of course not.
You're the one driving the horse.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.754
-Is this what I've got to look forward to?
-Yes.

23:02.839 --> 23:03.673
Forever.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.099
Is this how the castle felt to you?

24:38.768 --> 24:41.313
Before my mother first arrived
at your door?
