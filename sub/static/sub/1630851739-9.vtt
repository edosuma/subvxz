CHENG EN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:29.166 --> 00:31.375
The patient's pulse rate is 150.
Blood pressure is 78/38.

00:31.458 --> 00:32.583
The stab wound is about 6 cm.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.625
The initial diagnosis
was a hemorrhagic shock.

00:33.708 --> 00:34.666
It might have harmed his organs.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.583
He's in critical condition.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.416
Prepare for emergency blood transfusion
and surgery.

PRIVATE NUMBER

00:47.458 --> 00:48.416
Hello?

00:49.958 --> 00:54.208
DISORIENTATION

00:54.791 --> 00:56.625
So I still can't contact
his family members?

00:56.708 --> 00:59.083
-Yes.
-It seems like his family is abroad.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.541
Excuse me. How is Wang Po-han?

01:01.625 --> 01:03.500
Wang Po-han is undergoing
emergency surgery.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.333
Since he bled a lot from the wound
on his left abdomen,

01:05.416 --> 01:06.500
it might have harmed his organs.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.166
He is in critical condition right now.

01:08.250 --> 01:11.000
The hospital needs family members to sign
a consent form for surgery immediately.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.916
Miss, are you a family member?

01:13.416 --> 01:15.666
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

01:25.916 --> 01:28.000
Are you Ms. An Yi-chi?

01:30.208 --> 01:31.583
Yes, I am.

01:32.416 --> 01:34.625
We found you
through Wang Po-han's phone records.

01:34.708 --> 01:36.416
What's your relationship with him?

01:38.083 --> 01:39.458
I'm his assistant.

01:40.125 --> 01:40.958
Here's the thing.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.458
We couldn't get in touch with his family.

01:42.541 --> 01:44.416
Do you have their contact information?

01:45.125 --> 01:46.208
Family?

01:48.708 --> 01:50.541
His parents are in Canada.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.875
I don't know
his family's contact information.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.416
Then do you know Ms. Kung Li-na?

02:00.166 --> 02:01.625
<i>Ms. Huang Shu-hui.</i>

02:01.708 --> 02:04.250
Why did you attack Mr. Wang Po-han
with a knife?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.916
How is Po-han now?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.833
We haven't heard anything back yet,
so we're not sure.

02:09.791 --> 02:12.458
I really didn't mean
to stab him with a knife.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.208
I…

02:14.291 --> 02:15.416
I don't know…

02:16.625 --> 02:19.541
I don't know how it turned out this way.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.333
I really wasn't trying to kill him.

02:21.416 --> 02:22.291
I really…

02:22.375 --> 02:24.500
I don't know
why things turned out this way.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.625
-Calm down, okay?
-Can you please let me go

02:26.708 --> 02:28.333
to the hospital to see Po-han first?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.000
I didn't mean to do it.

02:31.666 --> 02:34.208
WANG PO-HAN,
SURGERY IN PROGRESS, 09**62

02:43.541 --> 02:46.875
Mom, I won't disappoint you this time
for sure.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.125
<i>You can do it, Ke-le!</i>

03:47.416 --> 03:49.916
Mr. Wang. Look, I broke the record.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.416
You're hugging me too tightly.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.250
It feels so hot.

04:20.541 --> 04:21.458
You've improved.

04:24.625 --> 04:25.500
Hey.

04:27.625 --> 04:28.625
Since I'm not around,

04:29.333 --> 04:30.625
is An Yi-chi very sad?

04:34.541 --> 04:35.375
Yes.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.875
Is she eating well?

04:43.833 --> 04:45.208
I knew it.

04:45.916 --> 04:47.750
She's a crybaby,

04:48.791 --> 04:50.708
yet she likes to pretend that she's fine.

04:56.541 --> 04:58.291
Luckily, you found your way home.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.291
I'm not sure either.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.416
I just kept thinking about going home

05:06.916 --> 05:08.041
and I came to this place.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.208
This place looks similar to my house,

05:12.541 --> 05:14.083
but An Yi-chi isn't here.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.083
But you met me.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.125
I'm here.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.541
Are you planning to stay here with me?

05:36.625 --> 05:37.958
I'm not sure either.

05:38.666 --> 05:42.250
It might be better to stay here with you.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.250
There won't be so many things
to worry about.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.375
FAMOUS MUSICIAN WANG PO-HAN
WAS STABBED

05:52.458 --> 05:54.125
BY EX-GIRLFRIEND
AND ACTRESS, KUNG LI-NA

05:56.500 --> 05:57.541
Chen Hsiao-kuai.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.208
You can't finish editing the videos,
yet you're playing with your phone.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.416
No, Cindy.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.625
Something happened
to the producer from E Shine

06:04.708 --> 06:06.125
who came to see you before.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.333
What happened?

06:09.041 --> 06:10.208
Steak knife.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.958
They couldn't agree
on relationship issues.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.083
I've always thought
that steak knives are dangerous.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.583
It's so sharp.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.458
Thank you for taking these photos for him.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.833
So after you were rescued,

06:52.916 --> 06:54.791
in order to finish that song,

06:54.875 --> 06:56.000
you hid for three years?

06:59.291 --> 07:00.208
The song is complete

07:00.291 --> 07:01.583
and it's with A-Lin now.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.375
Why did you come back?

07:11.750 --> 07:13.666
Does Yang Yu-hsien know that you're alive?

07:22.666 --> 07:24.000
You're really despicable.

07:27.541 --> 07:29.125
What do you take Yu-hsien for?

07:30.208 --> 07:32.125
Only you and Chang Che-kai matter

07:32.708 --> 07:34.666
and your love is the most precious one?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.541
Didn't he tell you?

07:42.166 --> 07:43.625
<i>Let's get married, okay?</i>

07:47.666 --> 07:49.083
Do you really love me?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.083
Stop lying to me.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.291
You love someone else,

08:12.125 --> 08:13.083
don't you?

08:28.250 --> 08:29.416
How nice.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.416
I don't know why you're doing this.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.208
But I'm definitely not the guy
you want to marry.

08:51.750 --> 08:52.833
I'm sorry.

08:55.666 --> 08:56.833
I'm a bit tired.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.750
Go home first.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.625
K is dying.

09:11.958 --> 09:13.500
So please,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.541
I'm begging you,

09:16.250 --> 09:17.875
marry me, okay?

09:20.791 --> 09:22.000
Just wait until…

09:22.083 --> 09:23.791
Until he rests in peace.

09:24.833 --> 09:25.833
Then I'll leave.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.250
I won't ever bother you again.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.291
I promise.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.416
So please,

09:38.583 --> 09:39.833
let's get married, okay?

09:59.125 --> 10:00.541
The two of you

10:01.916 --> 10:04.458
love each other
with all your heart and soul.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.833
<i>It's a very blissful thing.</i>

10:11.375 --> 10:13.166
<i>Anyway, loving someone that way</i>

10:13.250 --> 10:14.666
<i>is impossible for me now.</i>

10:18.541 --> 10:20.250
<i>Due to possible relationship disputes,</i>

10:20.333 --> 10:23.083
<i>the famous musician Wang Po-han
was stabbed a few days ago.</i>

10:23.166 --> 10:24.458
<i>After emergency treatment at the hospital,</i>

10:24.541 --> 10:26.208
<i>his condition is gradually stabilizing.</i>

10:26.291 --> 10:28.666
<i>He's still hospitalized
for observation and recovery.</i>

10:28.750 --> 10:31.625
<i>On the other hand, the production team
of Kung Li-na's new project</i>

10:31.708 --> 10:34.208
<i>made a new announcement.</i>

10:34.291 --> 10:36.708
<i>They said that
they'll replace the female lead.</i>

10:36.791 --> 10:39.416
<i>In fact, Kung Li-na joined the new project</i>

10:39.500 --> 10:43.250
<i>in hopes to clean up
her negative image from the past.</i>

10:43.333 --> 10:45.083
<i>Unexpectedly,
before the project wrapped up,</i>

10:45.166 --> 10:47.375
<i>she's suspected of being involved
in a wounding incident,</i>

10:47.458 --> 10:49.791
<i>causing an outcry on the Internet.</i>

10:49.875 --> 10:52.916
<i>Kung Li-na's image has hit rock bottom.</i>

11:18.208 --> 11:19.625
Let's eat.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.458
It's delicious.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.708
Why are you so good at cooking?

11:38.583 --> 11:40.500
Because I'm often alone.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.583
So whenever I got lonely or bored,

11:44.666 --> 11:46.125
I would listen to music

11:46.208 --> 11:47.541
while cooking for myself.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.541
Do you know why people feel lonely?

11:55.541 --> 11:57.958
Because the most important person
in your life

11:58.750 --> 12:00.458
isn't in your heart yet.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.416
That's why I don't feel lonely
even when I'm alone.

12:07.791 --> 12:10.583
Because the most important person
is already in my heart.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.583
Me too.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.000
Mr. Wang.

12:24.916 --> 12:26.333
Do you like my mom?

12:27.916 --> 12:28.750
Yes.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.833
Your time is almost up.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.583
What time?

12:43.291 --> 12:44.708
You shouldn't be here.

12:46.625 --> 12:47.833
Mr. Wang.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.958
Can you take care of An Yi-chi for me?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.000
Thank you.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.000
Mr. Chi.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.208
Po-han is awake.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.583
I'll get the doctor.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.750
You're finally awake.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.625
I was so scared when I saw the news.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.125
Wang Po-han.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.291
Are you hungry?

13:47.375 --> 13:49.541
I brought a lot of supplements for you.

13:49.625 --> 13:50.500
Look.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.208
Where's An Yi-chi?

14:01.541 --> 14:02.583
An-an?

14:03.416 --> 14:05.583
I didn't see her when I got here.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.291
Doctor, this way.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.083
I'll move this to examine him.

14:18.583 --> 14:19.416
Take this.

14:28.875 --> 14:29.875
<i>Don't worry.</i>

14:29.958 --> 14:32.041
<i>His vital signs seem stable.</i>

14:32.125 --> 14:34.541
It's only a matter of time
before he wakes up.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.541
Just think of him as resting
and sleeping for a long time.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.750
Don't worry.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.416
<i>Po-han.</i>

14:44.708 --> 14:46.208
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

14:49.666 --> 14:51.958
<i>But the pain of losing Ke-le</i>

14:53.583 --> 14:55.666
<i>is giving me a hard time.</i>

14:58.166 --> 15:01.125
<i>-Sometimes, missing him</i>
-Kids, come back. Hurry up.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.958
<i>-makes me feel like I can't even breathe.</i>
-Be careful.

15:05.958 --> 15:08.333
-Rock paper scissors!
-Rock paper scissors!

15:08.416 --> 15:11.375
<i>I can't stop missing Ke-le at all.</i>

15:12.041 --> 15:12.958
<i>Come here.</i>

15:20.208 --> 15:21.500
<i>I'm often wondering</i>

15:22.333 --> 15:25.250
<i>if he came back to see me.</i>

15:27.583 --> 15:29.208
<i>I'd tell him,</i>

15:30.458 --> 15:31.875
<i>"Don't cry, Ke-le.</i>

15:32.583 --> 15:33.750
<i>Go happily</i>

15:34.416 --> 15:36.250
<i>to the place
where there's no sickness and pain.</i>

15:37.375 --> 15:38.666
<i>Wait for me.</i>

15:40.541 --> 15:44.375
<i>Save your tears for me."</i>

15:48.916 --> 15:49.875
<i>Po-han,</i>

15:50.375 --> 15:51.416
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:53.625 --> 15:54.958
<i>I'm not confident</i>

15:55.041 --> 15:56.708
<i>to be able to say goodbye.</i>

16:00.416 --> 16:02.208
<i>I don't know</i>

16:04.000 --> 16:05.875
<i>how to let go of my sadness</i>

16:07.208 --> 16:08.708
<i>and get used to goodbyes.</i>

16:11.833 --> 16:14.791
<i>I can't keep pretending
to be strong anymore.</i>

16:15.791 --> 16:17.875
<i>I have no reason to stay here either.</i>

16:20.875 --> 16:22.791
AN YI-CHI

19:55.125 --> 19:57.250
<i>Thank you all so much for your concern.</i>

19:58.458 --> 20:01.541
<i>This matter has wasted
a lot of social resources.</i>

20:01.625 --> 20:03.458
<i>I would like to apologize for it first.</i>

20:04.916 --> 20:07.083
<i>I also want to clarify</i>

20:07.166 --> 20:08.583
<i>that this incident</i>

20:09.291 --> 20:10.833
<i>was totally an accident.</i>

20:10.916 --> 20:13.750
<i>It has nothing to do
with Ms. Kung Li-na at all.</i>

20:14.500 --> 20:18.125
<i>So I won't take
any legal action against her.</i>

20:20.458 --> 20:23.041
<i>-The Kung Li-na that I know</i>
-Thank you, sir.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.208
<i>is a hardworking</i>

20:25.291 --> 20:28.250
<i>and professional actress.</i>

20:31.750 --> 20:33.125
If you eat less today,

20:33.208 --> 20:35.416
people will think,
"Who are you trying to lie to?"

20:35.500 --> 20:38.000
And if you get mad, people will think
that you're overreacting.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.041
What has my appetite got to do
with anyone?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.708
Why are you laughing?
Have you never experienced this?

20:45.375 --> 20:46.958
How is that possible?

20:47.041 --> 20:48.500
Customers are very practical.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.125
Get serious.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.500
I'm very serious, okay?

20:55.500 --> 20:56.541
What?

20:56.625 --> 20:58.041
Let me take another look at it.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.791
<i>Her passion and perseverance</i>

21:00.875 --> 21:02.916
<i>-towards acting</i>
-I really love you.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.625
<i>are unimaginable.</i>

21:05.250 --> 21:06.166
This performance

21:06.750 --> 21:08.166
will make you known to others.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.833
Stop reading.

21:13.916 --> 21:14.916
This is delicious.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.541
No. I can't eat it.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.916
-Come on.
-No.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.416
-Come on.
<i>-So please,</i>

21:21.416 --> 21:22.958
<i>stop attacking her.</i>

21:23.041 --> 21:24.500
<i>Stop condemning her.</i>

21:25.875 --> 21:27.250
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

21:27.333 --> 21:28.208
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:58.083 --> 21:59.083
Why are you here?

21:59.625 --> 22:02.458
Your assistant called me
to pick out the raw photos.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.166
I was in the neighborhood, so I came here.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.833
Dr. Yang, why are you here?

22:08.541 --> 22:09.875
I came to pick out the raw photos.

22:12.291 --> 22:13.583
I don't know if it's convenient or not.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.125
Sure.

22:18.666 --> 22:19.708
This way, please.

22:22.958 --> 22:24.791
The raw photo's number is here below.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.958
Later, if you see something you like
or absolutely dislike, tell me.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.208
I'll mark them.

22:29.291 --> 22:30.333
Okay.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.208
Let's go through them in order.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.208
The light is not good
for the initial ones.

22:34.291 --> 22:35.208
This one.

22:36.416 --> 22:37.708
This one is fine.

22:38.708 --> 22:39.916
What about this?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.375
Dr. Yang. This one.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.208
This is good.

22:48.625 --> 22:49.458
What about this?

23:01.291 --> 23:02.333
Cindy.

23:03.625 --> 23:04.875
You have been nominated.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.958
"Photographer of the Year."

23:07.041 --> 23:08.166
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

23:08.250 --> 23:09.083
Really?

23:13.541 --> 23:15.541
Okay. How about we celebrate tonight?

23:16.083 --> 23:17.333
Okay. It's on me.

23:17.916 --> 23:18.750
Sure.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.416
<i>We'll edit the photos
and send them to you.</i>

23:25.500 --> 23:27.041
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.333
I'll get going.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.208
-The photos are fine, right?
-Yes.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.666
Can I have a cigarette?

23:45.541 --> 23:46.541
Sure.

24:03.958 --> 24:05.000
Congratulations.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.916
You're finally getting a result
from all your hard work.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.083
Thank you.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.708
What is it that you're reconsidering?

24:13.791 --> 24:14.708
What?

24:15.541 --> 24:16.666
You told me last time.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.291
Right.

24:21.333 --> 24:23.333
I was reconsidering our relationship.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.333
I realized that I'm not over you yet.

24:27.916 --> 24:29.416
I really admire you.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.958
I finally understand

24:34.416 --> 24:36.416
why love is not your priority.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.416
THESE BODIES OF DESIRES
HAVE BEEN INTERTWINED WITH ME.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.333
<i>That's why I've been trying hard
to adjust myself.</i>

25:10.250 --> 25:12.750
<i>I'm only able to muster up my courage</i>
<i>to tell you these things now.</i>

25:14.916 --> 25:15.958
If you

25:16.666 --> 25:18.666
need to work really hard
at adjusting yourself,

25:19.583 --> 25:21.541
I guess I'm really not suitable for you.

25:21.625 --> 25:22.875
I love you.

25:29.375 --> 25:31.125
After all this time, I still love you.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.000
I'm sorry to tell you these things.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.291
I just want

25:41.000 --> 25:43.125
to tell you how I feel.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.458
Now that you have a steady boyfriend,
I won't bother you anymore.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.333
A steady boyfriend?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.291
Yes.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.375
That guy just now.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.375
That's my manager.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.208
I don't have a boyfriend.

26:09.750 --> 26:11.208
So, tonight…

26:11.291 --> 26:12.166
I'm not free.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.208
-Tomorrow?
-I have to take photos.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.291
It's fine.

26:18.958 --> 26:20.166
I'll wait for you.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.541
Let's see.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.375
I'll keep waiting.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.208
Until you're willing to go out with me.

27:03.666 --> 27:06.291
<i>Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.</i>

27:33.000 --> 27:34.041
Thank you

27:34.750 --> 27:35.791
for defending me.

27:37.375 --> 27:38.583
It's nothing.

27:41.791 --> 27:42.833
I'm sorry.

27:44.416 --> 27:46.083
Not just for what I did this time,

27:46.166 --> 27:47.500
but also for everything

27:48.166 --> 27:49.458
I've done to you in the past.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.166
It's all in the past now.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.041
I'll still admit to everyone

27:56.125 --> 27:57.708
what I did to you.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.208
There's no need.

28:00.916 --> 28:03.125
It will affect your acting career.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.583
We already broke up.

28:06.666 --> 28:08.708
I can't be indebted to you forever.

28:10.791 --> 28:11.958
Also,

28:12.541 --> 28:14.250
I'm planning to work behind the camera.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.166
Why are you doing that?

28:21.666 --> 28:23.958
I guess I've never been ready
all this time.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.041
Perhaps one day,

28:27.125 --> 28:28.666
I'll become mature

28:28.750 --> 28:30.250
and can start again.

28:34.708 --> 28:35.666
Are…

28:36.166 --> 28:37.833
Are you sure about this?

28:38.416 --> 28:39.541
Yes.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.125
Wang Po-han.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.083
Are we still friends?

28:52.375 --> 28:53.416
Yes.

29:02.708 --> 29:03.750
I'm sorry.

29:05.125 --> 29:06.458
I'm sorry.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.416
I know.

29:17.916 --> 29:18.958
Welcome.

29:20.833 --> 29:21.750
This way, please.

30:03.916 --> 30:06.625
These are memories of our time together.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.208
I've captured you in the photos.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.541
I've also captured that version of myself
who was looking at you.

30:15.083 --> 30:16.416
I always thought

30:17.375 --> 30:19.416
that photography captures a moment.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.375
But after parting with you,

30:23.458 --> 30:26.625
I realized that I'm no longer satisfied

30:26.708 --> 30:28.875
with any moment in my camera.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.750
Hsiao-kuai took that photo.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.958
Normally, she's clumsy.

30:38.791 --> 30:40.625
But she's very observant.

30:47.666 --> 30:48.833
What I'm trying to say is

30:51.291 --> 30:53.083
that after everything we've been through,

30:54.583 --> 30:56.208
we both clearly know

30:57.291 --> 30:59.125
how different we are from each other.

31:00.541 --> 31:01.791
Do you think

31:04.541 --> 31:05.666
that we

31:06.375 --> 31:08.416
can still possibly…

31:44.708 --> 31:46.375
<i>Hello? It's me.</i>

31:46.458 --> 31:49.125
Was anyone able to contact Yi-chi?

31:49.833 --> 31:51.041
<i>No.</i>

31:51.125 --> 31:52.875
<i>Her phone is off.</i>

31:52.958 --> 31:54.458
<i>I went to her place.</i>

31:54.541 --> 31:56.000
<i>No one was there.</i>

31:56.083 --> 31:57.416
<i>Po-han.</i>

31:57.500 --> 31:59.166
<i>Are you sure you don't want
to take a few more days off?</i>

31:59.875 --> 32:01.250
<i>You're going back to work tomorrow?</i>

32:01.333 --> 32:02.375
<i>I'm fine.</i>

32:02.458 --> 32:04.208
<i>A-Lin's album has been delayed
for too long.</i>

32:04.916 --> 32:06.916
<i>"The Saddest Thing"
is about to start recording too.</i>

32:09.916 --> 32:10.833
<i>Hey.</i>

32:10.916 --> 32:13.666
<i>Please ask the others
if they know where she is.</i>

32:13.750 --> 32:15.291
<i>Okay, no problem.</i>

32:15.375 --> 32:16.625
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

32:16.708 --> 32:17.666
<i>Bye.</i>

32:21.666 --> 32:23.791
<i>The number you're calling is turned off.</i>

32:23.875 --> 32:25.416
<i>Please try again later.</i>

32:36.458 --> 32:40.458
WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU, AN YI-CHI?

32:40.541 --> 32:43.291
ARE YOU OKAY? WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
EVERYONE IS WORRIED.

32:43.375 --> 32:45.583
<i>I think I know how Cream felt.</i>

32:46.166 --> 32:47.916
After K died,

32:48.000 --> 32:49.708
she chose to commit suicide.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.250
She must've been heartbroken.

32:54.791 --> 32:56.500
Losing the person you love the most

32:57.083 --> 33:00.833
is the same as losing the reason to live.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.166
Hey.

33:12.041 --> 33:12.875
I'm sorry.

33:13.375 --> 33:15.875
I had some events before,
so I couldn't visit you.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.458
Thank you.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.458
It's okay. I won't die.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.541
I heard

33:21.625 --> 33:23.083
that An-an is missing.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.750
I've been looking for her for days.

33:26.833 --> 33:29.208
She came to see me just a few days ago.

33:31.791 --> 33:33.000
Why did she go to see you?

33:33.583 --> 33:34.958
She came to apologize.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.000
You're quitting?

33:43.458 --> 33:44.541
A-Lin.

33:47.541 --> 33:48.500
I'm sorry.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.916
I know how much this album means to you.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.208
However,

33:56.166 --> 33:58.625
I couldn't finish it.

33:59.208 --> 34:00.833
It's my fault.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.833
I'm really sorry.

34:03.541 --> 34:04.583
Is it because

34:06.250 --> 34:07.625
of what happened in your family?

34:21.791 --> 34:23.875
I want to take a break for a while.

34:25.083 --> 34:25.958
Then

34:26.583 --> 34:27.916
what about Po-han?

34:31.500 --> 34:32.708
What do you mean?

34:33.416 --> 34:34.625
Can't you tell

34:34.708 --> 34:37.708
how much we and Po-han need you?

34:47.541 --> 34:49.333
Po-han is a good person.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.416
But I'm really not capable

34:54.833 --> 34:56.625
of considering these things.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.208
I'm a lot like Cream, actually.

35:08.333 --> 35:10.625
<i>We've both lost</i>

35:11.833 --> 35:13.166
<i>the most important person in our lives.</i>

35:25.458 --> 35:26.708
<i>And the biggest wish</i>

35:30.750 --> 35:33.250
of that person before he died

35:35.291 --> 35:37.750
<i>was for us to be happy.</i>

35:45.250 --> 35:48.083
But how can I be happy without Ke-le?

36:18.291 --> 36:19.208
Ke-le.

36:21.416 --> 36:23.250
Is it because I was very fierce?

36:24.958 --> 36:26.666
I scolded you and made you cry.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.250
I took you to the beach.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.750
You were very happy that day, weren't you?

36:48.291 --> 36:50.750
Thank you for being my baby.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.000
THANK YOU, MOM,
FOR LETTING ME BE YOUR BABY

36:53.125 --> 36:55.500
Thank you for being my baby.

36:58.125 --> 37:01.000
But I'm not ready yet.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.750
Where did you want to go?

37:07.333 --> 37:09.416
Where did you go, Ke-le?

37:13.166 --> 37:15.291
I'm not ready yet.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.750
Come back.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.625
Come back, Ke-le.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.166
Come back.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.625
I'm sorry.

37:37.708 --> 37:40.083
I shouldn't be telling you these things
while you're working.

37:41.208 --> 37:42.041
I'm so immature.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.500
A-Lin, I'm sorry.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.500
I…

37:48.458 --> 37:49.666
I'll get going.

37:50.416 --> 37:51.958
What are your future plans?

37:55.750 --> 37:57.000
Maybe I'll go

37:58.500 --> 38:00.583
to the place closest to my son.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.583
That was what she told you?

38:18.583 --> 38:20.416
Then I know where she is. Thank you.
