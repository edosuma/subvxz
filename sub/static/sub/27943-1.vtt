Oh, um, yesterday.

01:55.023 --> 01:58.394
Was that after the
party, after we met?

02:00.663 --> 02:03.797
Yeah, I felt so bothered by
how much I flirted with you

02:03.799 --> 02:06.868
at the party that I broke
up with her afterwards.

02:06.870 --> 02:08.137
Right, right.

She was in love with me.

02:14.443 --> 02:16.811

that long, but she was, she was,

02:16.813 --> 02:18.147
she was in love.

02:20.617 --> 02:24.519
Maybe she wasn't as in
love with you as you think.

02:24.521 --> 02:28.690
Maybe she was just in love
with the man in your book.

02:28.692 --> 02:29.526
No.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.395
Used to happen
to me all the time.

02:34.397 --> 02:36.598
Still does, actually.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.605
Sorry, I've, uh, I haven't
got round to reading your book.

02:42.004 --> 02:45.573
No, I remember, like, wanting
to when it first came out,

02:45.575 --> 02:47.275
when there was all the
fuss about it, you know?

02:47.277 --> 02:49.112
Mm, it was all fuss.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.484
You might have told me
that you had a girlfriend

02:56.486 --> 02:58.054

- How am I mocking you?

05:30.309 --> 05:31.145
It.

05:33.246 --> 05:36.280
You're watching the cat
the whole fucking time?

05:36.282 --> 05:39.117
I've been trying not to, but.

05:39.119 --> 05:40.052
- Fuck.
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:40.054 --> 05:42.621
Hey, come back, come back.

05:42.623 --> 05:45.457
Come on, we've never
had unsuccessful sex.

05:45.459 --> 05:47.693
Yes, we have.

05:57.571 --> 06:00.405
So, he fell in
love with a Palestinian woman

06:00.407 --> 06:02.741
when he was a volunteer
doctor in Gaza,

06:02.743 --> 06:04.810
and then she ended
up getting killed.

06:04.812 --> 06:07.279
I can see how that would
sell a million copies.

06:07.281 --> 06:08.116
Mm, two.

06:10.651 --> 06:12.250
Does he fuck heroically?

06:12.252 --> 06:14.753
All one night stands
are acts of bravery.

06:14.755 --> 06:15.756
Or defeat.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.127
Hey, if you're going to work,

06:21.129 --> 06:22.795
do you think you could give
me a lift down the hill?

06:22.797 --> 06:24.997
Andrea, you really need
to learn how to drive,

06:24.999 --> 06:25.932
you know that?

06:25.934 --> 06:27.800
Or else you're just not really

06:27.802 --> 06:29.367
engaging with the city at all.

06:29.369 --> 06:30.368
It's better this way.

06:30.370 --> 06:31.904
I get more writing done.

06:31.906 --> 06:33.506
Why, 'cause you're trapped?

06:33.508 --> 06:35.009
Yeah, it's good.

06:36.410 --> 06:37.443
So, can you give me a lift?

06:40.682 --> 06:44.285
I slept with someone
I just met last night.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.693
Was that whore-ish?

06:53.061 --> 06:55.328
Was that a whore-ish
thing to do, do you think?

06:55.330 --> 06:56.264
Oh, well.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.802
You have a whore-ish
vibe about you.

07:03.304 --> 07:04.737
How?

07:04.739 --> 07:05.573
How?

07:07.009 --> 07:10.643
Your clothes, your hair,
I mean, your manner, really.

07:10.645 --> 07:14.216
When I first met you,
I thought, she's, uh,

07:15.651 --> 07:17.820
she'd be open to anything.

07:20.122 --> 07:21.655
- That is not true.
- I know.

07:21.657 --> 07:24.992
I know it's not, and I know
that you've moved down here,

07:24.994 --> 07:28.327
you have got yourself clean,
you go to your meetings.

07:28.329 --> 07:30.499
You got yourself together.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.768
Yeah, I have,
it's been a year.

07:34.770 --> 07:35.771
Right, so?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.306
This is the first untogether
thing you've done in a year.

07:39.308 --> 07:42.609
That's not really
a big deal, is it?

07:42.611 --> 07:46.580
What do you think
of these Clooney news?

07:46.582 --> 07:49.550
Haven't you heard he wants to
play you in the adaptation?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.752
Uh, I kinda think that

07:51.754 --> 07:55.522
George Clooney looks
like a dirty old uncle.

07:55.524 --> 07:57.926
Oh, god, no, were you abused?

07:57.928 --> 07:59.093
No.

07:59.095 --> 08:01.095
Ah, ah.

08:01.097 --> 08:03.198
You saw a bestselling
memoir right there

08:03.200 --> 08:04.431
in front of your
eyes, didn't you?

08:04.433 --> 08:05.599
No, no, I mean, I
don't know, maybe.

08:05.601 --> 08:07.135
You're something else.

08:07.137 --> 08:08.069
No, no, no, I'd take any
book you had to offer me,

08:08.071 --> 08:09.304
you know that.

08:09.306 --> 08:10.805
I'm just waiting for you
to tell me what it is.

08:10.807 --> 08:12.173
Otherwise, why would I be
here sweating in California

08:12.175 --> 08:13.473
when I could be in civilization?

08:13.475 --> 08:15.476
I'm sorry, it
was a happy childhood.

08:15.478 --> 08:17.278
No, no, good, that's good.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.715
Good, jolly good.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.983
Look, I'm a doctor.

08:21.985 --> 08:24.719
I wrote a book
that moved people.

08:24.721 --> 08:28.590
I don't really know anything
about his world of celebrity,

08:28.592 --> 08:30.425
- all that's...
- Hi, um,

08:30.427 --> 08:32.160
I just wanted to tell
you that your book

08:32.163 --> 08:34.962
is the most beautiful love
story I have ever read

08:34.965 --> 08:35.830
in my entire life.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.765
Oh, thank you.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.001
- Okay.
- Nice seeing you.

08:39.003 --> 08:40.534
Thanks.

08:40.537 --> 08:42.539
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

08:46.210 --> 08:49.377
What are you thinking about?

08:49.379 --> 08:52.882
I was trying to conjure
up what Naima looked like.

08:52.884 --> 08:55.985
It's been too long now that
I feel I've almost lost her.

08:55.987 --> 08:58.020
No, she's on the page forever.

08:58.022 --> 08:59.755
She's in our hearts forever.

08:59.757 --> 09:00.956
Oh, no, I'll get this.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.390
- No, I'd like to.
- Oh, no, no.

09:02.392 --> 09:03.458
'Cause I can expense it.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.392
Don't be ridiculous.

09:04.394 --> 09:05.594
No, no, no, I would like to

09:05.596 --> 09:07.529
because you're a
woman and I'm a man.

09:14.306 --> 09:16.672
- You're really beardy.
- Mm.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.375
I've done
everything I can,

09:18.377 --> 09:20.876
but it's pretty hard with the...

09:20.878 --> 09:22.444
Yeah, I know, it's limiting.

09:22.446 --> 09:23.946
I told my wife it would be

09:23.948 --> 09:27.616
but she said this is one
great anniversary present.

09:27.618 --> 09:28.619
Mm.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.786
It's not you.

09:30.788 --> 09:32.788
You're very good, actually.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.190
I know.

09:34.192 --> 09:36.293
- Oh, what is that, it's...
- Really soothing.

09:36.295 --> 09:40.330
It's got a little bit of
orange, a little bit of clove,

09:40.332 --> 09:42.332
- and myrrh.
- That sounds biblical.

09:42.334 --> 09:43.934
Yes, I do a toner,

09:43.936 --> 09:46.836
and then I do a microdermabrasion,
and then I take a sword

09:46.838 --> 09:50.407
and I sacrifice you
to a vengeful lord.

09:50.409 --> 09:51.574
Just kidding.

09:51.576 --> 09:55.211
God steps in and
saves you at the end.

09:55.213 --> 09:57.380
So what do you do?

09:57.382 --> 09:59.015
I'm a rabbi.

09:59.017 --> 10:00.517
- You're kidding.
- No.

10:00.519 --> 10:02.320
You're just saying that
because of what I just said.

10:02.322 --> 10:04.187
You're just making fun of me
because you have a beard...

10:04.189 --> 10:06.723
That I grew just so I can
tell people I'm a rabbi?

10:06.725 --> 10:08.625
No, why are you so surprised?

10:08.627 --> 10:10.727
I just didn't think
that you'd be able to,

10:10.729 --> 10:11.795
to do something like this.

10:11.797 --> 10:13.596
- Why?
- Wasn't it vain?

10:13.598 --> 10:15.665
It feels vain, yeah.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.235
Do you feel like an asshole?

10:18.237 --> 10:19.469
I, uh.

10:19.471 --> 10:21.638
I'm sorry, I'm
a really bad Jew.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.274
I feel weird even touching you,

10:23.276 --> 10:25.475
like I'm touching the Torah
on my period or something.

10:26.645 --> 10:29.148
I'm not, I finished
four days ago.

10:30.283 --> 10:31.550
Three days ago.

10:32.684 --> 10:36.320
Oh, well, that
explains a lot, I guess.

10:36.322 --> 10:37.321
Thanks for sharing.

10:37.323 --> 10:38.823
I'm sorry.

10:38.825 --> 10:39.790
Am I blotchy at all?

10:39.792 --> 10:40.825
No, you're glowing.

10:40.827 --> 10:42.195
Oh, good, yeah.

10:43.463 --> 10:44.729
I feel like a foreskin.

10:46.899 --> 10:49.200
I don't know why I said that.

10:49.202 --> 10:50.601
Listen, Tara, thank
you very much.

10:50.603 --> 10:52.003
Aw, thank you.

10:52.005 --> 10:53.137
You did great.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.507
It was a lot
of hard work, believe me.

10:56.509 --> 10:58.210
All right, bye.

10:58.212 --> 11:00.578
I wish that I had asked
my dad more about Jew stuff,

11:00.580 --> 11:02.180
but I don't really think

11:02.182 --> 11:03.748
that he even knew
that much himself.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.385
I mean, he grew up in England
and they kinda kept it quiet.

11:06.387 --> 11:08.420
My grandparents sent him to
boarding school when he was four

11:08.422 --> 11:10.921
so he would become less Jewish.

11:10.923 --> 11:12.556
That is awful.

11:12.558 --> 11:14.759
Listen, if you wanna
reconnect with your roots,

11:14.761 --> 11:17.362
feel free to come to
my congregation, okay,

11:17.364 --> 11:19.064
I think you'd really enjoy it.

11:19.066 --> 11:20.564
Okay.

11:20.566 --> 11:21.532
Come before I die.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.429
You don't write very
well for a writer.

11:49.431 --> 11:51.696
Um, I'm a doctor.

11:51.698 --> 11:53.565
I could do a post-coital
removal of your spleen

11:53.567 --> 11:55.834
but I think you'd be
even less inclined

11:55.836 --> 11:57.236
to sleep with me again.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.473
- Again?
- Yeah.

11:59.541 --> 12:00.540
What?

12:00.542 --> 12:02.475
I thought it went well.

12:02.477 --> 12:04.377
It went well like
a Scrabble game?

12:04.379 --> 12:08.514
Look, we can have a fling,
if you want, an affair.

12:08.516 --> 12:09.681
A flingair?

12:09.683 --> 12:11.252
Yeah, a flingair.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.652
How would you define that?

12:13.654 --> 12:16.389
Something that's
so light as air

12:16.391 --> 12:18.825
that neither one of us
could possibly get hurt.

12:18.827 --> 12:22.728
You know, I bought my cousins
a toy once called a flinger.

12:22.730 --> 12:25.298
It was this sort of long,
stretchy jelly hand thing,

12:25.300 --> 12:28.234
and you could fling
it at other kids or,

12:28.236 --> 12:31.407
if you were feeling
bold, at an adult.

12:34.042 --> 12:36.876
Um, did you take my shirt?

12:36.878 --> 12:37.712
No.

12:39.013 --> 12:41.548
Maybe we're just
better as a one off.

12:41.550 --> 12:44.585
You know, like all those
beautiful one hit wonder bands.

12:44.587 --> 12:47.387
No, no, I wanna see you again.

12:47.389 --> 12:52.328
I just, I guess I feel that I
don't wanna have to call you.

12:55.763 --> 12:57.397
If you don't want to call me

12:57.399 --> 12:59.800
and you do want to
have sex with me,

12:59.802 --> 13:03.370
then how will I know
if you want sex?

13:03.372 --> 13:04.304
I'll text you.

13:11.914 --> 13:13.581
You look really great.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.351
Thank you, you too.

13:17.521 --> 13:18.685
It's been a really long time.

13:18.687 --> 13:19.920
Did you fall in love again?

13:19.922 --> 13:21.788
You must have, tell
me, you did, you must,

13:21.790 --> 13:24.294
because you love love so much.

13:25.428 --> 13:27.295
Why, did you?

13:27.297 --> 13:28.896
No, I didn't fall in love.

13:28.898 --> 13:31.765
I did get married again, though.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.667
Wow, you like getting married.

13:33.669 --> 13:36.237
Oh, the first one
doesn't count, right?

13:36.239 --> 13:39.873
I mean, you were
practically a child bride.

13:39.875 --> 13:40.776
Oh, sure.

13:43.146 --> 13:47.150
And are you still taking smack?

13:48.351 --> 13:51.922
Yeah, yeah, I do, I
do still take heroin.

13:53.390 --> 13:54.324
I smoke it.

13:55.192 --> 13:56.026
You, um?

13:57.460 --> 13:59.796
Uh, you know, I got clean.

14:01.865 --> 14:03.568
- 20th time lucky.
- Ah.

14:07.971 --> 14:10.972
But you're
so different to her.

14:10.974 --> 14:13.875
Yeah, well, I had Good Dad.

14:13.877 --> 14:16.744
You saw me when he died,
he was the love of my life.

14:16.746 --> 14:18.982
It's not her memory of him.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.218
How old?

14:22.220 --> 14:23.084
- What?
- No, no, your dog.

14:23.086 --> 14:25.254
Your dog, no, six?

14:25.256 --> 14:26.455
Six.

14:26.457 --> 14:27.722
Ha, yeah, you're
really good at that.

14:27.724 --> 14:29.757
Thank you, she broke
up with me for a month

14:29.759 --> 14:31.926
and all I did was
sit on the couch

14:31.928 --> 14:34.498
watching The Dog Whisperer, so.

14:37.801 --> 14:38.636
Ugh.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.005
Baby, I've got some news.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.473
What?

14:44.475 --> 14:46.710
I have, uh, I got a gig.

14:46.712 --> 14:48.944
The house behind
The Canyon Store?

14:48.946 --> 14:50.714
No, no, no, not
that type of gig.

14:50.716 --> 14:53.150
Like, I mean, like a gig gig.

14:58.155 --> 15:03.160
I am putting the
band back together.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.795
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:06.797 --> 15:07.997
Just, I mean, just for a night,

15:07.999 --> 15:09.164
- just for a night.
- Oh, my god.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.533
But if it goes
well, if it goes well,

15:10.535 --> 15:12.269
then I'm gonna do it
for another night.

15:12.271 --> 15:13.836
And then another night,
and then another night,

15:13.838 --> 15:15.771
and then another night, and.

15:15.773 --> 15:16.774
Mm.

15:24.383 --> 15:27.484
The internet is
actually fast food

15:27.486 --> 15:30.754
that you can eat
without chewing.

15:30.756 --> 15:32.255
That's his wife.

15:32.257 --> 15:33.156
Yes, it's made
the world a smaller place,

15:33.158 --> 15:34.391
- they say,
- I've met her.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.592
But is that
really a good thing?

15:35.594 --> 15:37.861
She can be a
controlling bitch.

15:37.863 --> 15:40.030
Libraries are the
loneliest place in town...

15:40.032 --> 15:41.431
I'm Rachel.

15:41.433 --> 15:42.365
I'm the daughter.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.435
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

15:44.870 --> 15:48.874
The things we need most
are not informational.

15:50.376 --> 15:52.545
Can Siri Google your soul?

15:56.114 --> 15:58.783
I'd like to end tonight
by reminding you

15:58.785 --> 16:00.351
that at the end of the month,

16:00.353 --> 16:03.554
we have our rally for
our Syrian refugees.

16:03.556 --> 16:04.988
I'd like you all to be there

16:04.990 --> 16:07.425
because somebody was
there for us when we came.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.794
Somebody was there for your
grandfather when he came.

16:09.796 --> 16:12.663
Somebody was there for your
great-grandfather when he came.

16:12.665 --> 16:14.233
Somebody was there.

16:15.768 --> 16:17.335
So be there for them.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.257
Shabbat shalom.

16:40.259 --> 16:41.158
Hello, again.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.394
Thank you.

16:42.396 --> 16:43.662
Hi.

16:43.664 --> 16:44.596
I had a feeling I
would see you here.

16:44.598 --> 16:46.097
- You did?
- I did, I did.

16:46.099 --> 16:47.164
How does my skin look?

16:47.166 --> 16:48.199
- Fine.
- Good.

16:49.636 --> 16:50.635
This is actually my first
time at a temple ever.

16:50.637 --> 16:52.204
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:52.206 --> 16:55.809
Except for, um, when
my dad died last year.

16:56.976 --> 16:58.810
- I'm sorry.
- We were more cultural Jews.

16:58.812 --> 17:00.245
- Bagels...
- Woody Allen.

17:00.247 --> 17:01.747
Albert Brooks.

17:01.749 --> 17:03.815
Albert Brooks, Lost in
America, fantastic movie.

17:03.817 --> 17:05.016
Your daughter is really nice.

17:05.018 --> 17:06.218
No, she's not.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.721
I'm just kidding, yes,
she's lovely, thank you.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.522
I had nothing to do
with that, believe me.

17:11.525 --> 17:13.492
Will you come to the rally
at the end of the month?

17:13.493 --> 17:16.027
I can't, my boyfriend
is actually playing a show

17:16.029 --> 17:18.664
that night, he's a musician,
he used to be a rock guy

17:18.665 --> 17:20.800
before I knew him,
before I was born.

17:20.801 --> 17:22.769
No, just kidding.

17:22.771 --> 17:25.270
But, uh, yeah, I
should go to that.

17:25.271 --> 17:27.172
Okay.

17:27.174 --> 17:28.406
Why don't you bring
him next time?

17:28.409 --> 17:29.709
- He's not Jewish.
- It doesn't matter.

17:29.711 --> 17:31.209
We extend the branch to
people of all faiths.

17:31.211 --> 17:33.813
And you see how important
music is to the service.

17:33.815 --> 17:35.180
I'd love you to bring him.

17:35.182 --> 17:36.915
This was a rocking
Shabbat, was it not?

17:36.917 --> 17:38.150
Yes.

17:38.152 --> 17:38.984
Wait, is it Talia?

17:38.986 --> 17:39.918
No, it's Tara.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.621
Oh, my bad, I Italianized you,

17:41.623 --> 17:43.556
which is the secret wish
of all Jewish women.

17:45.627 --> 17:46.459
What are you wearing?

17:46.461 --> 17:47.393
It smells amazing.

17:47.395 --> 17:48.895
I don't think it's anything.

17:48.897 --> 17:50.696
That's all, that's natural?

17:50.698 --> 17:52.565
Yes.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.400
Oh, so the last
time I saw you,

17:54.402 --> 17:55.701
I was naked

17:55.703 --> 17:57.871
- and covered in honey.
- Hello.

17:57.873 --> 18:00.106
I work at a spa.

18:00.108 --> 18:01.340
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:01.342 --> 18:03.509
Tara, thank you
so much for coming.

18:03.511 --> 18:04.577
- Thank you.
- It was delightful

18:04.579 --> 18:06.012
- to see you again.
- Yes.

18:06.014 --> 18:07.213
- I appreciate it.
- Can I, you know who she

18:07.215 --> 18:08.782
- really reminds me of?
- Who is that, dear?

18:08.784 --> 18:11.384
Maria Schneider in
Last Tango in Paris.

18:11.386 --> 18:12.719
- Oh.
- I...

18:12.721 --> 18:14.353
- No, I'm telling you.
- I'll Google it.

18:14.355 --> 18:15.356
Maybe not.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.625
- It's rather racy.
- Oh.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.259
She's a grown
woman.

18:20.261 --> 18:21.528
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:21.530 --> 18:23.229
- Shabbat shalom.
- Shabbat shalom.

18:23.231 --> 18:24.498
Shabbat shalom.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.432
He marched with
Martin Luther King

18:25.434 --> 18:26.834
in the civil right movement.

18:26.836 --> 18:30.437
He's like this
electric, famous orator.

18:30.439 --> 18:33.005
He's a total, total rockstar.

18:33.007 --> 18:33.973
Is he a charlatan?

18:33.975 --> 18:35.676
No, why would you say that?

18:35.678 --> 18:39.112
I wouldn't trust anyone
you called a rockstar.

18:39.114 --> 18:41.281
Except Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young.

18:41.283 --> 18:42.149
You trust all four of them?

18:42.151 --> 18:43.385
No, not Neil.

18:45.387 --> 18:46.987
I don't know why, though,
there's something...

18:46.989 --> 18:48.789
Is it because he looks like
a horse peed on his jeans

18:48.791 --> 18:51.058
and he just left them on
and let them dry in the sun?

18:51.060 --> 18:55.028
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.330
Why are you wearing
a bloke's shirt?

18:56.332 --> 18:57.799
This is just my nightie.

18:57.801 --> 19:01.235
You had a one night stand,
now you're wearing his nightie.

19:01.237 --> 19:03.370
It's mine, I earned it.

19:03.372 --> 19:04.939
It's not even a good one.

19:04.941 --> 19:06.173
How do you know?

19:06.175 --> 19:07.942
'Cause I used to be
able to afford them.

19:07.944 --> 19:09.109
Stop.

19:09.111 --> 19:10.010
You should send it back.

19:10.012 --> 19:11.613
You know where he lives?

19:11.615 --> 19:14.983
'Cause you don't wanna be
smelling it and giving you ideas.

19:14.985 --> 19:16.216
What ideas?

19:16.218 --> 19:17.652
Well, that it's more
than a one night stand.

19:17.654 --> 19:19.354
It's not, I said that.

19:19.356 --> 19:21.623
He actually asked me if I
wanted to have an affair,

19:21.625 --> 19:23.191
and I said no.

When I was 13, we were
living on the Lower East Side

21:05.397 --> 21:07.330
of New York City, and
two floors above us

21:07.332 --> 21:09.100
was a young man named
Mickey Schwerner.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.900
Ah, that's a Jewish name.

21:10.902 --> 21:15.908
That's like being called
Joey Rabinowitz.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.947
Well, Mickey and his wife
Rita lived two floors above us,

21:21.380 --> 21:23.313
and he was older than I was,
but he was very good to me

21:23.315 --> 21:24.815
in a way that older boys are not

21:24.817 --> 21:26.884
'cause they don't like to be
seen with the little kids.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.385
Mm-hmm.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.788
And they were activists.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.489
They worked for CORE.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.758
CORE?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.325
Congress of Racial Equality.

21:35.327 --> 21:39.195
Hmm, that would definitely
be an abs class now.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.665
And they were
very brave people.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.366
They were Freedom Riders
in the truest sense.

21:42.368 --> 21:43.968
They would go down South

21:43.970 --> 21:47.038
and register African
Americans to vote.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.940
They would boycott businesses
until they desegregated.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.108
Mm-hmm.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.610
They were very
inspiring young people,

21:52.612 --> 21:56.180
and it was Mickey who
taught me about Dr. King.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.582
And I read everything I could.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.986
And I listened to
him whenever I could.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.057
And I just was awestruck.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.095
I know you make
a solid living,

22:10.097 --> 22:14.265
but I've never seen
you actually painting.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.435
I am starving.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.436
Do you wanna get breakfast?

22:18.438 --> 22:21.008
Doing the walk of shame, huh?

22:22.176 --> 22:24.776
No, I don't feel shame.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.011
Oh, you should.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.378
It's a very useful emotion.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.050
You are so fucking judgmental.

22:31.652 --> 22:32.884
You must have been
a shit rockstar.

22:32.886 --> 22:35.387
No, I was good,
actually, and beloved,

22:35.389 --> 22:36.521
which your sister will find out

22:36.523 --> 22:37.889
when she comes to see the show.

22:37.891 --> 22:41.727
I sat next to Mickey
just so by osmosis

22:41.729 --> 22:44.029
I thought I could become
a better person, you know?

22:44.031 --> 22:46.099
But it doesn't work
by osmosis, no,

22:46.101 --> 22:49.468
you have to walk the walk,
talk the talk, ride the bus.

22:49.470 --> 22:54.439
And 50 years later, organize
a rally for Syrian refugees.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.076
Sorry, I didn't mean
to say Syrian refugees

22:57.078 --> 22:59.411
like it was a bad thing.

22:59.413 --> 23:01.049
It is a bad thing.

23:04.351 --> 23:05.586
Is that pink?

23:06.755 --> 23:10.489
Are you gonna be doing
a cover of Barbie Girl?

23:10.491 --> 23:11.791
- By Aqua?
- Yeah, I fucking know

23:11.793 --> 23:12.959
who sings Barbie Girl.

23:12.961 --> 23:14.259
You've got me pegged
wrong, sister.

23:14.261 --> 23:16.428
You've got me in the
one hit wonder count,

23:16.430 --> 23:17.997
but I had two hits.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.900
Two bites at the cherry, so.

23:20.902 --> 23:24.403
You know, I have a picture,
George Harrison, in my office,

23:24.405 --> 23:25.838
because I thought he
was the one Beatle

23:25.840 --> 23:28.407
that was truest to his ideals.

23:28.409 --> 23:30.777
Yeah, he also spoiled at
least three classic albums

23:30.779 --> 23:32.812
with his love of sitar.

23:34.282 --> 23:38.284
Wait, um, do you guys
want to come with me tonight

23:38.286 --> 23:39.621
to a book party?

23:40.955 --> 23:42.024
She's busy.

23:45.393 --> 23:46.228
Okay.

23:47.163 --> 23:48.728
Well, do you want to come?

23:51.299 --> 23:52.698
No.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.036
No, you're rude.

23:55.137 --> 23:56.138
You're rude.

23:58.841 --> 24:02.912
You look like velvet but
you're Velcro, scratchy.

24:04.113 --> 24:07.850
So then what happened
with Mickey Jewinowitz?

24:09.618 --> 24:13.587
Mickey was murdered
in 1964 in Mississippi

24:13.589 --> 24:16.690
along with two fellow
civil rights workers,

24:16.692 --> 24:19.693
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman.

24:19.695 --> 24:21.895
They were beaten, shot to death,

24:21.897 --> 24:24.965
and buried by
members of the KKK.

24:28.971 --> 24:30.871
Long time ago.

24:30.873 --> 24:34.075
But that's what got me started.

24:34.077 --> 24:37.711
I didn't know where
that story was going.

24:37.713 --> 24:42.152
I'm sorry, I was just trying
to make you laugh, and...

24:43.552 --> 24:44.819
Tara, no, no, no.

24:44.821 --> 24:46.754
You didn't know what
I was about to say.

24:46.756 --> 24:49.958
So, what did you wanna ask me?

24:49.960 --> 24:53.630
Oh, um, your boyfriend
is a musician, yes?

24:56.299 --> 24:57.832
Yeah.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.467
Oh, so I was thinking that
maybe you could talk to him

24:59.469 --> 25:02.537
about organizing an
interfaith concert

25:02.539 --> 25:04.474
in support of the rally.

25:05.343 --> 25:06.176
Uh,

25:08.178 --> 25:09.345
- yep.
- Yes?

25:09.347 --> 25:11.646
- Okay.
- I think it'd be spectacular.

25:11.648 --> 25:12.981
I will do that
when I get home.

25:12.983 --> 25:15.385
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

25:25.762 --> 25:28.266
I'm really sorry about Mickey.

25:29.532 --> 25:30.533
Thank you.

25:48.552 --> 25:50.152
Hey.

25:50.154 --> 25:51.587
Oh.

25:51.589 --> 25:52.590
I'm Sevan.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.992

Seven Nation Army.

25:56.994 --> 26:00.397

26:03.901 --> 26:04.669

26:06.104 --> 26:07.836
You know, I once wrote a
story for The Paris Review,

26:07.838 --> 26:09.406
it's about this beautiful girl,

26:09.408 --> 26:11.540
she worked in a vintage store...

26:11.542 --> 26:13.442
I don't work in
a vintage store.

26:14.512 --> 26:16.112

definitely work in that

26:17.615 --> 26:18.547

26:18.549 --> 26:21.017
You know, don't give up.

26:21.019 --> 26:22.551
I'm a published author.

26:22.553 --> 26:23.485
Okay, okay.

26:23.487 --> 26:24.854
So, what's the book about,

26:24.856 --> 26:26.323
that you're trying
to get published?

26:26.325 --> 26:30.293
It's been published in
several different languages.

26:30.295 --> 26:31.129
Hey.

26:57.290 --> 26:58.890
- Yeah, hi.
- Hello.

26:59.958 --> 27:02.492

27:02.494 --> 27:06.163

27:07.300 --> 27:08.134
Always.

27:14.573 --> 27:17.441
Um, you are quite the amazon.

That's why she's
good to have at a party

27:19.412 --> 27:21.078

sell a lot of books.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.079
Hey.

27:22.081 --> 27:22.915
Hey.

Freedom when was, what, 23?

27:28.489 --> 27:31.322
Oh, yes, of
course, great book.

27:31.324 --> 27:32.723
Right, right, so,

27:32.725 --> 27:33.591
Sorry, who are you?

27:33.593 --> 27:34.792
Oh, I don't matter.

27:34.794 --> 27:36.027
Come on, man,
everyone matters.

27:37.498 --> 27:39.764
Everyone's got a good book
in them too, you know?

27:39.766 --> 27:40.600
I don't.

27:47.307 --> 27:48.206
I'd better go.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.441
Sorry, man.

27:49.443 --> 27:51.243
No, can I talk to
you for a moment?

27:51.245 --> 27:52.079
Yeah.

- I'm staying.

28:01.955 --> 28:03.422
How are you gonna get home?

28:03.424 --> 28:05.857
Yes, I do remember that book.

28:05.859 --> 28:07.092
It wasn't bad at all,

28:07.094 --> 28:08.226
although I don't agree
with the philosophy

28:08.228 --> 28:10.495
behind the Anxiety is Freedom.

28:10.497 --> 28:11.863
Even understand anxiety,

28:11.865 --> 28:14.232
it's such a foreign
concept to me.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.734
You can go, it's fine.

28:15.736 --> 28:19.838
What would you sister say
if I just abandoned you here?

28:19.840 --> 28:21.239
She doesn't care.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.908
She doesn't do what
you want her to do,

28:22.910 --> 28:26.414
why would you do what
she wants you to do?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.450
Ugh.

28:30.452 --> 28:32.452
So, you're
English, are you?

- Yes.
- Yeah, where are you from?

I hear you're a
fantastic musician.

37:57.796 --> 38:00.196
And I'll paint your
house for a 100 quid.

38:00.198 --> 38:01.799
Wow, is that good?

38:01.801 --> 38:02.766
No, not really.

38:03.970 --> 38:06.137
Well, we're big fans
of your girl here.

38:06.139 --> 38:07.740
Yeah, more woman.

38:08.741 --> 38:11.274
I always end up explaining that.

38:11.276 --> 38:12.109
To whom?

38:12.111 --> 38:13.946
Um, myself, I think.

38:16.181 --> 38:17.515
I really love the dancers.

38:17.517 --> 38:18.983
- Well, that was Josie's idea.
- Oh.

38:18.985 --> 38:20.751
And they're part of the
rally at the end of the month.

38:20.753 --> 38:21.986
I'm sorry you can't make that.

38:21.988 --> 38:25.923
- Hmm, unfortunately we can't.
- We can't.

38:25.925 --> 38:27.792
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:27.794 --> 38:31.495
Boy, the Holocaust was a
terrible business, wasn't it?

38:31.497 --> 38:34.100
I mean, just terrible business.

38:47.181 --> 38:50.851
Why is it taking you
so long to write again?

38:53.787 --> 38:55.723
I got clean.

38:57.791 --> 39:00.424
When was the last time
you went to a meeting?

39:00.426 --> 39:02.761
Um, I go twice a week.

39:02.763 --> 39:05.699
So last time I went
was a month ago.

39:07.801 --> 39:10.102
That guy, that is
a serious, look it,

39:10.104 --> 39:13.138
he's a seriously
good-looking guy.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.305
Look, pfft.

39:14.307 --> 39:16.374
He's not a writer.

39:16.376 --> 39:17.544
He's a doctor.

39:20.380 --> 39:23.281
He doesn't slave over sentences.

39:23.283 --> 39:26.121
He's just a chancer
who got lucky.

39:28.223 --> 39:30.722
Fuck me, you're
in love with him

39:30.724 --> 39:32.994
and jealous of him as well.

39:36.898 --> 39:38.900
There is no true love.

39:39.968 --> 39:42.369
Only a finely tuned jealousy.

39:44.005 --> 39:44.839
Oh.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.708
- Did you write that?
- Yes.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.209
No, you didn't.

39:50.211 --> 39:53.280
It's a Manic Street
Preachers B-Side.

39:56.751 --> 39:59.087
My influences are diverse.

40:00.221 --> 40:01.388
Oh.

40:02.690 --> 40:03.923
All I'm saying is that

40:03.925 --> 40:06.192
something really
sad happened to him,

40:06.194 --> 40:09.464
and all he had to do
was write it down.

40:10.465 --> 40:12.133
He had to feel it.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.435
He had to translate the feeling.

40:16.437 --> 40:19.372
♪ There ain't
hardly been a time ♪

40:19.374 --> 40:24.379
♪ When that's been
too good to lose ♪

40:26.148 --> 40:28.982
♪ When I should know

40:28.984 --> 40:33.088
♪ That I'm always
free to choose ♪

40:33.956 --> 40:36.058
Good day's work?

40:40.029 --> 40:44.765
I'm sorry, I was just
really focused on this thing.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.633
I got you a Torah.

40:46.635 --> 40:48.202
You're proselytizing now?

40:48.204 --> 40:51.104
No, I just thought that you
might get something out of it.

40:51.106 --> 40:51.907
Thanks.

40:55.444 --> 40:56.276
What's wrong with Perry?

40:56.278 --> 40:57.678
What do you mean?

40:57.680 --> 41:00.250
I mean he looks really weird.

41:01.116 --> 41:03.085
He always looks weird.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.492
Right, I'm gonna
take him to the vet.

41:15.798 --> 41:17.531
Okay, Perry.

41:17.533 --> 41:18.765
Perry, I'm gonna
take you to the vet

41:18.767 --> 41:21.537
just as soon as
I get back, okay?

41:39.421 --> 41:42.724
I keep thinking of
you there in Gaza

41:42.726 --> 41:44.895
and all that you went through.

41:48.832 --> 41:50.867
Yeah, come here.

41:56.940 --> 41:59.308
Oh, god, everything I
wanna say is so crazy.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.279
I just wanna be stopped.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.822
Hey, you okay?

42:12.990 --> 42:13.824
Yeah.

42:15.893 --> 42:17.592
- No.
- I'm sorry.

42:17.594 --> 42:19.762
When you say to me,

42:19.764 --> 42:23.200
when you say to me
that you wanna own me,

42:25.670 --> 42:27.736
why you say that?

42:27.738 --> 42:30.973
'Cause you're so beautiful.

42:30.975 --> 42:33.342
Why do you wanna be owned?

42:33.344 --> 42:36.781
'Cause I wanna be
corralled by someone.

42:38.983 --> 42:43.388
I wanna be led to some sort
of safety in confinement.

42:47.024 --> 42:50.362
I wish you didn't
do this to yourself.

42:52.463 --> 42:53.265
So do I.

42:57.402 --> 43:00.303
It was the strangest thing,

43:00.305 --> 43:04.307
waiting for my dad to
come home from tour,

43:04.309 --> 43:06.910
just waiting for him to
pay attention to anything

43:06.912 --> 43:10.315
but his fucking band,
you know, and just.

43:13.218 --> 43:17.220
But he couldn't, because
then he would come home,

43:17.222 --> 43:20.724
then he would come home and
just want to get strung out.

43:20.726 --> 43:22.258
That's horrible.

43:22.260 --> 43:27.165
So then, when I was 15, I
decided to join him, and I did.

43:29.302 --> 43:30.267
And I did.

43:30.269 --> 43:31.536
Jesus Christ.

43:33.206 --> 43:36.039
It worked then
for a few weeks.

43:36.041 --> 43:39.609
But then he was so
upset by what he'd done,

43:39.611 --> 43:41.745
and he got clean.

43:41.747 --> 43:45.016
Something
cracked in him, I guess.

43:45.018 --> 43:47.784
And I got stuck, you see?

43:47.786 --> 43:49.956
I got stuck, I got hooked.

43:51.491 --> 43:54.994
I got hooked and I
couldn't get off of it.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.036
You're all right.

44:56.790 --> 44:57.724
I'm here.

45:36.498 --> 45:37.332
Perry?

45:42.804 --> 45:43.638
Perry.

45:48.076 --> 45:51.210
Perry.

45:53.549 --> 45:54.383
Oh!

45:56.084 --> 46:00.186
So your cat hadn't
urinated in over four days.

46:00.188 --> 46:02.121
He has crystals in his urine

46:02.123 --> 46:04.324
that can't pass through the
tip of the urethra in his penis

46:04.326 --> 46:06.125
because it's too narrow.

46:06.127 --> 46:07.927
In extreme cases,

46:07.929 --> 46:11.398
we castrate them and
we reconstruct a vagina

46:11.400 --> 46:15.701
so that the urethra is wide
enough for the crystals to pass.

46:15.703 --> 46:19.542
I'm afraid that's what
we need to do to Perry.

46:21.043 --> 46:22.409
You're joking.

46:22.411 --> 46:24.111
I'm serious.

46:24.113 --> 46:25.781
He'll die otherwise.

46:26.982 --> 46:29.483
Be happy you got
him here in time.

46:29.485 --> 46:32.488
And that you gave
him a unisex name.

46:35.457 --> 46:36.524
Hey.

46:36.526 --> 46:38.058
Where the fuck were you?

46:38.060 --> 46:39.927
Yeah, I was helping the
rabbi archive his sermons.

46:39.929 --> 46:40.861
Of course you were.

46:40.863 --> 46:42.095
What's that supposed to mean?

46:42.097 --> 46:43.665
You think this man is
gonna change your life

46:43.667 --> 46:45.533
like some magical unicorn?

46:45.535 --> 46:47.368
I don't think that
he really unicorn.

46:47.370 --> 46:48.835
You think he's a Pegasus?

46:48.837 --> 46:51.071
Some sort of Yiddish leprechaun?

46:51.073 --> 46:52.674
One who's going
to grant your wish

46:52.676 --> 46:54.242
and lead you to
your pot o' gelt?

46:54.244 --> 46:56.710
Oh, so should I be like you?

46:56.712 --> 46:58.446
Chasing a man in the
prime of his career

46:58.448 --> 46:59.913
and screwing every girl he can,

46:59.915 --> 47:02.849
texting you when he possibly
remember to give a fuck?

47:02.851 --> 47:03.687
Ladies.

47:04.820 --> 47:05.655
Calm down.

47:14.698 --> 47:16.032
Ahem.

47:17.234 --> 47:19.469
Hi, gorgeous, missed you.

47:23.373 --> 47:28.378
All right, no, you can't be
here to talk about promotion.

47:29.312 --> 47:31.312
We're flogging a
dead horse here.

47:31.314 --> 47:34.884
No, I'm not, we're
not flogging anything.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.128
Um, you excuse me a minute?

47:48.466 --> 47:50.900
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.537
It's okay.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.339
Fuck.

47:57.774 --> 47:58.707
Fuck!

48:06.017 --> 48:07.383
If I get the risotto,

48:07.385 --> 48:08.851
you'll help me out
with that, would you?

48:08.853 --> 48:11.787
The ninth printing of
your memoir has been halted,

48:11.789 --> 48:14.256
effective immediately.

48:14.258 --> 48:15.725
Why?

48:15.727 --> 48:19.765
All existing copies are
being pulped and you know why.

48:21.799 --> 48:23.600
I don't know why.

48:23.602 --> 48:25.801
Ah, god, don't do
this, this is dull.

48:25.803 --> 48:26.902
Are we really gonna do this?

48:26.904 --> 48:27.803
I don't know why.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.539
Can you fill me in?

48:29.541 --> 48:33.008
Hmm.

48:33.010 --> 48:36.045
You see, Nick, there
wasn't a Naima.

48:36.047 --> 48:38.214
You made her up.

48:38.216 --> 48:42.054
Your whole tragic love
story was an invention.

48:50.262 --> 48:51.496
I'm so sorry.

48:53.265 --> 48:56.767
I actually
don't think that you are.

48:56.769 --> 48:58.601
When I realized that
you'd figured it out,

48:58.603 --> 49:03.442
I went into the bathroom and
I vomited into the trash can.

49:05.243 --> 49:06.912
Show me the vomit.

49:09.181 --> 49:10.448
What?

49:10.450 --> 49:14.084
If you were in the
bathroom, by a loo,

49:14.086 --> 49:17.155
why would you vomit
into a trash can?

49:21.694 --> 49:22.861
You see, Nick,

49:24.096 --> 49:26.366
it just doesn't make sense.

49:35.041 --> 49:37.210
I'm sorry you found out.

49:43.583 --> 49:45.084
Are you all right?

49:47.220 --> 49:49.186
Can you come by?

49:49.188 --> 49:52.556
Tonight, please,
come by, tonight.

49:52.558 --> 49:55.025
I need to talk to you.

49:55.027 --> 49:57.230
Because I feel like I can.

50:15.915 --> 50:20.050
♪ Shiny happy people holding

50:20.052 --> 50:22.788
♪ Shiny happy people...

50:22.790 --> 50:23.624
Hey, um,

50:25.592 --> 50:28.493
do you think that Martin's
gonna be okay for his show?

50:28.495 --> 50:31.963
Yeah, I mean, he's
certainly excited about it.

50:31.965 --> 50:34.801
Mainly for you to be there.

50:34.803 --> 50:37.068
You've never seen
that part of his life.

50:37.070 --> 50:40.338
Right, but do you
think that he's ready?

50:40.340 --> 50:44.911
Um, he's definitely been
eating in preparation for it.

50:44.913 --> 50:46.445
Has he?

50:46.447 --> 50:48.714
Tara, he's gained, like,
10 pounds in the last week.

50:50.819 --> 50:52.752
Oh, shh, it's him, hi.

50:52.754 --> 50:54.487
Hi, baby.

50:54.489 --> 50:55.855
It's your baby.

50:55.857 --> 50:57.356
Shh, sorry, babe.

50:57.358 --> 50:58.925
I can't really
hear you right now.

50:58.927 --> 51:01.861
That's because he's
eating the phone.

51:01.863 --> 51:04.129
He's accidentally dialed
the number with his tooth.

51:04.131 --> 51:04.933
- No.
- Shh!

51:05.934 --> 51:07.333
Let me call you right back.

51:07.335 --> 51:10.236
Okay, I love you too, bye.

51:10.238 --> 51:12.038
Are you just bathing in
your bras and underwear?

51:12.040 --> 51:15.141
I'm washing 'em, killing
two birds with one stone.

51:15.143 --> 51:18.411
Yeah, but then you're just
stewing in your own filth.

51:18.413 --> 51:19.247
Always.

51:59.121 --> 52:01.822
Pared the set list
down from 12 to 10,

52:01.824 --> 52:03.924
gonna leave them wanting
more, blah blah blah.

52:03.926 --> 52:05.628
And sold 400 tickets.

52:07.396 --> 52:09.498
Can we get home?

52:10.699 --> 52:11.532
Sir, can I ask you?

52:11.534 --> 52:12.799
How old are your dogs?

52:12.801 --> 52:15.302
Is the one that you're
holding six or seven,

52:15.304 --> 52:17.139
and your son's, three?

52:18.407 --> 52:19.841
Seven and three, yeah.

52:19.843 --> 52:21.343
Seven and three.

52:22.578 --> 52:24.177
I've still got it, baby.

52:24.179 --> 52:25.847
I really, really need to pee.

52:25.849 --> 52:27.047
So go.

52:27.049 --> 52:27.982
Look, right there.

52:27.984 --> 52:29.684
I painted the sign myself.

52:29.686 --> 52:30.919
That doesn't look like a lady.

52:30.921 --> 52:34.221
And yet you know
that that is a lady.

52:34.223 --> 52:35.892
I'll just skip it.

52:38.260 --> 52:40.461
Because I'm not Basquiat,
you'd rather, what,

52:40.463 --> 52:42.797
- piss in your pants?
- Yeah, I would.

52:42.799 --> 52:43.800
Hmm, okay.

52:44.668 --> 52:45.600
Basquiat was an abstractist,

52:45.602 --> 52:46.834
so that wasn't a good example.

52:46.836 --> 52:49.003
Well, Wittgenstein
was a philosopher,

52:49.005 --> 52:50.238
and he basically said

52:50.240 --> 52:52.640
that if you recognize
something as a sign,

52:52.642 --> 52:54.811
then it is a correct sign.

52:56.179 --> 52:57.314
That's a lady.

53:00.952 --> 53:02.183
What?

53:02.185 --> 53:03.718
I'm sure I'm not the
first kid to piss myself

53:03.720 --> 53:04.887
on that jungle gym.

53:04.889 --> 53:06.456
You're not a kid.

53:07.925 --> 53:10.993
Just 'cause you're younger
than me, you're an adult.

53:10.995 --> 53:12.596
You're meant to be.

53:18.769 --> 53:20.002
Is there any situation

53:20.004 --> 53:23.407
in which you wouldn't
be attracted to me?

53:25.308 --> 53:26.542
What?

53:26.544 --> 53:30.111
I'm not attracted to
you right now, okay?

53:30.113 --> 53:31.616
You're scaring me.

53:33.250 --> 53:34.683
What's with you?

53:34.685 --> 53:35.684
What's changed?

53:35.686 --> 53:36.919
What have I done?

53:36.921 --> 53:38.387
- It's like I annoy you.
- Yeah, you're annoying.

53:38.389 --> 53:40.391
You're a fucking cunt!

53:41.993 --> 53:44.228
Do you want those washed?

54:04.315 --> 54:07.050
That was unforgivable.

54:07.052 --> 54:09.418
You're beautiful,
you're not a cunt.

54:09.420 --> 54:10.656
I am, though.

54:11.890 --> 54:13.089
I hate it.

54:13.091 --> 54:14.189
I didn't wanna
spoil the surprise,

54:14.191 --> 54:15.992
but I've written you a song.

54:15.994 --> 54:18.762
I don't wanna
hear it right now.

54:18.764 --> 54:21.933
I'll play it for
you tomorrow night.

54:23.402 --> 54:24.236
Okay.

54:31.276 --> 54:33.010
Why weren't you answering me?

54:33.012 --> 54:34.513
I was going crazy.

54:39.018 --> 54:43.188
My cat had actually had
an emergency sex change.

54:47.060 --> 54:48.326
It cost $5,000.

54:49.862 --> 54:52.529
They found, like, crystals
got caught in his urine

54:52.531 --> 54:55.132
and they actually
blocked his penis,

54:55.134 --> 54:58.169
so they had to remove
the entire thing.

54:58.171 --> 55:02.675
It kinda felt like a sign,
I mean the castration part.

55:16.322 --> 55:18.591
I think we should break up.

55:19.559 --> 55:20.393
Why?

55:22.295 --> 55:24.662
If what we're having
is meaningless,

55:24.664 --> 55:27.767
what meaning is
there in breaking up?

55:29.136 --> 55:31.103
Have you lost weight?

55:31.105 --> 55:32.037
Why?

55:32.039 --> 55:34.338
Your boobs look smaller.

55:34.340 --> 55:35.974
Do you want your money back?

55:35.976 --> 55:38.509
No, Jesus, what
do you think of me?

55:38.511 --> 55:41.680
Look, you were just so sad
last time you were here,

55:41.682 --> 55:43.215
I was worried.

55:43.217 --> 55:47.219
So worried that you had to
leave while I was sleeping.

55:47.221 --> 55:49.322
I had to clear my head.

55:50.924 --> 55:52.924
I really don't know you.

55:52.926 --> 55:55.496
I mean, other than your memoir.

55:59.466 --> 56:02.834
Look, I'm a good guy, really.

56:02.836 --> 56:05.672
I know, it says
so in your novel.

56:10.444 --> 56:11.643
R.E.M.

56:11.645 --> 56:13.011
I don't want to listen
to R.E.M. right now.

56:13.013 --> 56:15.248
Okay, right, R.E.M.,
they were seen as hollow

56:15.250 --> 56:17.016
just because they were
so fucking popular,

56:17.018 --> 56:18.852
but they were special.

56:19.888 --> 56:21.087
And just because

56:21.089 --> 56:22.587
they were on the fucking
radio all the time,

56:22.589 --> 56:25.290
it doesn't negate the songs
that Michael Stipe wrote.

56:25.292 --> 56:26.993
Are you saying that
you are the Michael Stipe

56:26.995 --> 56:28.495
of this situation?

56:33.367 --> 56:34.301
You know,

56:36.336 --> 56:40.473
I loved the part in your
novel where you say...

56:40.475 --> 56:41.641
Wait.

56:41.643 --> 56:42.441
- ...that the mouth...
- I'm sorry.

56:42.443 --> 56:43.645
You read my novel?

56:46.948 --> 56:48.783
Of course, I had to.

56:49.784 --> 56:52.618
I had to piece it together.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.821
We have great sex.

56:54.823 --> 56:56.290
Thank you.

56:56.292 --> 56:59.727
No, I mean, it's not
you, it's just chemistry.

57:00.562 --> 57:02.196
Okay.

57:02.198 --> 57:05.265
What do you think it means?

57:05.267 --> 57:09.771
I think it means that we
are compatible in some way.

57:13.909 --> 57:15.911
But you don't want that.

57:17.046 --> 57:19.148
No, and neither do you.

57:44.673 --> 57:46.073
Thank you.

57:46.075 --> 57:47.608
Hello, there.

57:47.610 --> 57:51.411
Um, so, we are in a little
bit of a delay right now.

57:51.413 --> 57:56.050
There's a lot of traffic,
people can't get here.

57:56.052 --> 57:57.517
I guess the moral
of the story is

57:57.519 --> 57:59.921
don't schedule a rally during
rush hour in Los Angeles.

57:59.923 --> 58:01.655
But people are coming in.

58:01.657 --> 58:03.892
We're hoping for a
very large turnout

58:03.894 --> 58:08.096
because this is such, such a
test of people's compassion.

58:08.098 --> 58:09.030
Okay.

58:09.032 --> 58:10.033
Thank you.

58:14.536 --> 58:17.437
Okay, the ones that are
here are really passionate.

58:17.439 --> 58:19.240
Oh, please don't.

58:19.242 --> 58:20.911
There's nobody here.

58:22.212 --> 58:23.645
- Well...
- I can't.

58:23.647 --> 58:24.979
- No, there's...
- Jo.

58:24.981 --> 58:25.813
There's a
really big accident...

58:25.815 --> 58:26.848
- Jo.
- Okay.

58:26.850 --> 58:28.317
- They're coming, though.
- Jo, Jo.

58:28.319 --> 58:31.353
We don't even have enough
for minion man march.

58:31.355 --> 58:33.523
What is wrong with people?

58:38.195 --> 58:39.194
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, hey.

58:39.196 --> 58:40.695
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:40.697 --> 58:42.366
- Nice, um.
- Andrea.

58:43.833 --> 58:46.101
This is my girlfriend's
big sister.

58:46.103 --> 58:47.369
Big
sis, the older one.

58:47.371 --> 58:48.603
Let's go.

58:48.605 --> 58:51.943
- You, you don't know.
- Nice to meet you.

58:56.180 --> 59:00.049
- It's so smoky, it's like...
- Well, it is a club.

59:00.051 --> 59:01.850
Yeah, but I can't sing.

59:01.852 --> 59:04.186
Can't you stop
being such an old man?

59:04.188 --> 59:07.022
Not really.

59:07.024 --> 59:08.958
Where is she?

59:08.960 --> 59:11.360
Uh, I mean, she
must be on her way.

59:11.362 --> 59:13.896
She's probably having
trouble parking.

59:13.898 --> 59:16.999
I have to do
something, I'm sorry.

59:17.001 --> 59:18.233
What?

59:18.235 --> 59:19.702
It's going
to help, I promise.

59:19.704 --> 59:21.103
Oh, no, no.

59:21.105 --> 59:22.272
- No, no, no, no.
- Please, please.

59:22.274 --> 59:23.806
Fuck off, fuck off.

59:23.808 --> 59:24.807
I want
you to look great.

59:24.809 --> 59:27.344
Look, I'm, I'm old, I mean.

59:27.346 --> 59:30.681
Yeah, but you can
be old and sexy too.

59:33.051 --> 59:33.951
I just, uh.

59:39.358 --> 59:41.126
All right, oh, sorry.

59:46.098 --> 59:46.932

Come on, now.

01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:09.864
Are you crazy?

01:04:09.866 --> 01:04:12.400
She only wanted to
buy you a drink.

01:04:12.402 --> 01:04:16.004
Fuck Tara, she
isn't fucking here.

01:04:16.006 --> 01:04:17.171
You want me to
cheat on your sister?

01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:19.207
- That's not gonna happen.
- No.

01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:22.745
No, I'm not, I would not like
you to cheat on my sister,

01:04:22.747 --> 01:04:24.178
but I would like her
to treat you better.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.514
She treats me fine.

01:04:25.516 --> 01:04:27.618
Hmm, then where is she?

01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:37.126
You're right,
she should be here.

01:04:37.128 --> 01:04:37.962
Hmm.

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:51.375
Um.

01:04:54.178 --> 01:04:55.012
I can't.

01:04:58.883 --> 01:04:59.718
Why?

01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:04.721
It won't make me any younger.

01:05:04.723 --> 01:05:09.459
It won't make me less
committed to another woman.

01:05:09.461 --> 01:05:10.961
Tara, but I can't.

01:05:14.065 --> 01:05:16.566
You're gonna make a lot
of mistakes in your life.

01:05:16.568 --> 01:05:18.969
I don't wanna be one of them.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:28.913
Sorry.

01:05:32.451 --> 01:05:35.786
You look like her,
you smell like her.

01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:38.457
But you are nice to me, and I...

01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:41.093
It's okay.

01:05:42.861 --> 01:05:44.596
Didn't mean anything.

01:05:46.231 --> 01:05:48.500
Just that you're not happy.

01:05:52.705 --> 01:05:55.107
So why do you put up with it?

01:05:56.843 --> 01:05:59.111
- Because I love her.
- Hmm.

01:06:08.354 --> 01:06:13.126
How was it?

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.104
He kissed me

01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:29.442
for a second.

01:06:31.544 --> 01:06:33.312
He thought I was you.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:38.518
He wanted me to be you.

01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:48.762
Of course he wants
me to be you.

01:07:13.754 --> 01:07:15.922
You should have been there.

01:07:15.924 --> 01:07:17.022
You missed out.

01:07:22.062 --> 01:07:25.065
I don't wanna be
with you anymore.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.081
Okay, just

01:07:45.453 --> 01:07:48.721
tell me what I need
to do to fix it.

01:07:48.723 --> 01:07:51.826
Why don't you kiss
my sister again?

01:07:53.161 --> 01:07:54.395
Oh, fuck off.

01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:02.938
You're a coward.

01:08:26.562 --> 01:08:30.464
Hey, how old is
your dog, nine, 10?

01:08:30.466 --> 01:08:33.969
She's one.

01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:38.139
Don't look at my dog.

01:09:27.756 --> 01:09:30.925
He doesn't have to
go back to Australia.

01:09:30.926 --> 01:09:34.962
I told him he didn't even
have to move out of the house.

01:09:34.965 --> 01:09:36.633
Of course he does.

01:09:37.533 --> 01:09:39.703
You're so fucking selfish.

01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:41.770
I mean,

01:09:43.573 --> 01:09:45.841
when you love someone,

01:09:45.843 --> 01:09:47.910
your lives intertwine.

01:09:47.912 --> 01:09:49.310
You take responsibility
for them.

01:09:49.312 --> 01:09:50.377
He took responsibility for you.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.649

- You're almost done.
- No, I'm absolutely not.

The only thing I
wrote this summer

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.152
was a few clever texts to Nick.

01:15:58.222 --> 01:15:59.888
Oh, and I wrote an essay.

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:01.090

about two weeks ago.

01:16:18.576 --> 01:16:19.411
Yeah.

01:16:22.948 --> 01:16:24.347
There were too many ands.

01:16:24.349 --> 01:16:26.018
Look, I'll show you.

01:16:30.722 --> 01:16:33.522
And Abraham went
up out of Egypt,

01:16:33.524 --> 01:16:36.693
and he went on his journey
from the South to Bethlehem,

01:16:36.695 --> 01:16:39.095
and Abraham called out
in the name of the Lord.

01:16:39.097 --> 01:16:40.265
It's too much.

01:16:43.301 --> 01:16:44.234

01:16:50.275 --> 01:16:51.109

volunteer in Gaza?

01:17:05.224 --> 01:17:06.656
Yeah.

01:17:06.658 --> 01:17:08.894
But there wasn't a Naima.

01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:14.965
There was an Arab
girl at a McDonald's

01:17:14.967 --> 01:17:17.702
that I thought
was really pretty.

01:17:19.539 --> 01:17:20.805
What?

01:17:20.807 --> 01:17:22.809
She stayed in my head.

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:26.446
And what happened to her?

01:17:27.747 --> 01:17:30.149
She just stayed in my head.

01:17:31.317 --> 01:17:33.820
Wow, really, that's amazing.

01:17:34.987 --> 01:17:37.121
That's real writing.

01:17:37.123 --> 01:17:41.125
That's experience strained
through imagination.

01:17:41.127 --> 01:17:42.529
Do you know that?

01:17:43.696 --> 01:17:44.929
You know, I only
lied about love.

01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:47.501
That was the only
thing I lied about.

01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:50.502
That's why
everyone is so upset.

01:17:50.504 --> 01:17:52.437
If you had lied
about anything else,

01:17:52.439 --> 01:17:55.107
they would have
forgiven you by now.

01:17:55.109 --> 01:17:59.077
Then my editor said
that she knew all along

01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:01.379
that there was something hollow
about the heart of all this.

01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:02.449
She didn't.

01:18:03.917 --> 01:18:04.717
No.

01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:08.887

on The View to apologize.

01:18:08.889 --> 01:18:11.156
Don't do that, you
shouldn't do that.

01:18:11.158 --> 01:18:12.390

I did was so wrong.

Oh, hi, hi.

01:23:48.001 --> 01:23:51.770
Yeah, I can't get him to
stop licking the wound.

01:23:51.772 --> 01:23:53.505
If he
keeps licking the wound,

01:23:53.507 --> 01:23:57.175
it isn't gonna heal properly,
so you have to cover it,

01:23:57.177 --> 01:23:58.911
but not with a bandage.

01:23:58.913 --> 01:24:01.081
So then, with what then?

01:24:02.483 --> 01:24:04.884
A t-shirt.

01:24:04.886 --> 01:24:06.151
A t-shirt?

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:30.142
Look at all the different
elephants, seven, eight.

01:24:30.144 --> 01:24:32.111
The holographic one.

01:24:32.113 --> 01:24:35.450
With the massive
trunk coming through.

01:24:37.185 --> 01:24:40.788
So what massive, massive,
massive 3D trunk.

01:24:50.198 --> 01:24:53.099
What's the name of that week
long intensive driving course

01:24:53.101 --> 01:24:55.370
that you wanted me to take?

01:25:09.418 --> 01:25:13.287
♪ Shiny happy people holding

01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:17.391
♪ Shiny happy people holding

01:25:17.393 --> 01:25:21.662
♪ Shiny happy people laughing

01:25:46.022 --> 01:25:50.627
Why are you going to him
when you just sent him away?

01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:58.533
Because I made a really,
really bad mistake.

01:25:58.535 --> 01:26:00.470
Maybe, but you're 23.

01:26:02.104 --> 01:26:04.906
You're allowed to get it wrong.

01:26:04.908 --> 01:26:07.077
And you can tell him that.

01:26:12.482 --> 01:26:13.316
Thanks.

01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:19.589
You're welcome.

01:26:25.428 --> 01:26:26.262
Um...

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.869
All right, I'll
carry it for you.

01:26:42.613 --> 01:26:44.913
And this right here.

01:26:44.915 --> 01:26:46.280
There you go.

01:26:46.282 --> 01:26:47.215
You should check your mirrors,

01:26:47.217 --> 01:26:49.720
make sure they're all in place.

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:52.286
Oh, look, look,

01:26:52.288 --> 01:26:53.288
you're not gonna get too
far with these on, though.

01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:54.857
I get that from the start.

01:26:54.859 --> 01:26:55.793
Oh, okay.

01:27:34.032 --> 01:27:36.633
I shouldn't have
shouted like that.

01:27:36.635 --> 01:27:38.470
My throat still hurts.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:43.440
I finally had the guts to
re-read what you wrote about us

01:27:43.442 --> 01:27:49.448
and this time it made me
want to die 52% less.

01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:53.785
I felt the writing was

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.856
great.

01:28:00.759 --> 01:28:02.095
Haiku for Perry.

01:28:03.029 --> 01:28:06.197
Crystals are for
snow and jewels.

01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:07.632
Not good in cats.

01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:11.070
Girls are better anyway.

01:28:24.784 --> 01:28:28.054
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.161
Or your ire.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.836
You can come up here to me.

01:28:47.006 --> 01:28:48.075
Okay, then.

01:28:49.876 --> 01:28:52.843
I got smacked in the face at
the bus stop by a crackhead.

01:28:52.845 --> 01:28:54.081
Jesus Christ.

01:28:55.314 --> 01:28:56.547
Did they catch him?

01:28:56.549 --> 01:28:57.849
Was a her.

01:28:57.851 --> 01:28:59.519
And no, they didn't.

01:29:00.686 --> 01:29:03.587
It's the LAPD, do
you think they care?

01:29:03.589 --> 01:29:04.758
Probably not.

01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:10.063
I care.

01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:19.338
Can I stay with you?

01:29:21.008 --> 01:29:21.842
Here?

01:29:25.646 --> 01:29:26.480
Um,

01:29:28.315 --> 01:29:29.149
yes.

01:29:30.584 --> 01:29:35.522
But your face is making
me shy.

01:29:37.724 --> 01:29:39.793
It's making me shy too.

01:29:46.333 --> 01:29:51.072
Do you remember what you
said the first night when we...

01:29:52.707 --> 01:29:55.710
None of that means
anything to me.

01:30:00.748 --> 01:30:02.750
Can we just start again?

01:31:36.146 --> 01:31:39.314
Do you wanna drive
us to breakfast?

01:31:39.316 --> 01:31:43.653
I can't drive without
passenger who has a license.

01:31:45.055 --> 01:31:46.056
All right.

01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:49.290
Well, if neither of us
are capable of driving,

01:31:49.292 --> 01:31:52.026
then I guess we're just
gonna have to walk.
