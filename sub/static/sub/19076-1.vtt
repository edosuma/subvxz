02:14.886 --> 02:18.216
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

02:32.904 --> 02:36.244
<i>1633,</i> pax Christi,

02:36.324 --> 02:38.084
<i>praised be God.</i>

02:39.786 --> 02:41.496
<i>Although for us,</i>

02:41.579 --> 02:43.749
<i>there is little peace in this land now.</i>

02:45.083 --> 02:48.253
<i>I never knew Japan when it was
a country of light,</i>

02:48.336 --> 02:51.296
<i>but I have never known it
to be as dark as it is now.</i>

02:52.549 --> 02:54.129
<i>All our progress has ended.</i>

02:54.217 --> 02:57.717
<i>A new persecution, new repression,</i>

02:57.804 --> 02:59.104
<i>new suffering.</i>

03:01.683 --> 03:07.023
<i>They use ladles filled with holes,
so the drops would come out slowly</i>

03:07.105 --> 03:09.565
<i>and the pain would be prolonged.</i>

03:09.941 --> 03:12.111
<i>Each small splash of the water</i>

03:12.944 --> 03:15.204
<i>was like a burning coal.</i>

03:18.950 --> 03:21.450
<i>The Governor of Nagasaki
took four friars</i>

03:21.703 --> 03:24.293
<i>and one of our own society to Unzen.</i>

03:25.790 --> 03:27.670
<i>There are hot springs there.</i>

03:28.960 --> 03:34.130
<i>The Japanese call them "hells,"
partly, I think, in mockery</i>

03:34.215 --> 03:38.045
<i>and partly, I must tell you, in truth.</i>

03:45.685 --> 03:47.555
<i>The officials told our</i> padres

03:47.645 --> 03:50.855
<i>to abandon God
and the gospel of His love.</i>

03:52.066 --> 03:55.486
<i>But they not only refused to apostatize,</i>

03:55.570 --> 03:58.360
<i>they asked to be tortured,</i>

03:58.448 --> 04:01.278
<i>so they could demonstrate
the strength of their faith</i>

04:01.367 --> 04:03.407
<i>and the presence of God within them.</i>

04:06.122 --> 04:10.002
<i>Some remained on the mountain
for 33 days.</i>

04:14.464 --> 04:16.764
<i>The story of their courage</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:20.511
<i>gives hope to those of us priests
who remain here in secret.</i>

04:21.346 --> 04:24.096
<i>We will not abandon
our hidden Christians</i>

04:25.141 --> 04:26.981
<i>- who live in fear.</i>
- "...who live in fear."

04:29.145 --> 04:32.685
<i>We only grow stronger in His love.</i>

04:38.196 --> 04:41.156
<i>Ferreira is lost to us.</i>

04:45.703 --> 04:47.913
This was his last letter.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.878
Why lost?

04:52.919 --> 04:55.509
This letter came to us
when we were traveling from Portugal.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.628
It took years to reach us.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.425
It was hidden, smuggled, ransomed.

05:00.510 --> 05:03.350
Finally, put into my hand
by a Dutch trader,

05:04.722 --> 05:06.892
who had other news as well.

05:09.394 --> 05:10.734
He's alive?

05:12.772 --> 05:14.772
That he apostatized,

05:15.858 --> 05:20.238
that he denounced God in public
and surrendered the faith,

05:20.697 --> 05:22.737
and is now living as a Japanese.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.038
That's not possible.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.294
Father Ferreira risked his life
to spread our faith all over Japan.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.047
We're here today because of him.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.876
Yes. He was...

05:39.966 --> 05:41.876
He's the strongest of us.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.487
<i>He wrote those words</i>

05:43.511 --> 05:46.391
<i>during the most
sweeping persecution of all.</i>

05:46.472 --> 05:48.732
<i>Now, things are even worse.</i>

05:48.808 --> 05:52.728
<i>Thousands are dead
because of what we brought them.</i>

05:53.104 --> 05:55.614
<i>Thousands more
have given up the faith.</i>

05:57.233 --> 06:01.113
You said this trader brought news,
but it's not proven, is it?

06:01.195 --> 06:05.905
It could be a slander created
to further discredit our faith.

06:05.992 --> 06:09.162
Given the extent of the persecution
in that country...

06:09.245 --> 06:11.265
Yes. But, respectfully,
there must be multitudes there

06:11.289 --> 06:13.079
- who need us, too.
- And the fact,

06:13.499 --> 06:15.079
there has been no other word of him,

06:15.168 --> 06:16.878
and the news brought by the Dutch...

06:16.961 --> 06:18.381
Rumor, Father, only.

06:18.463 --> 06:21.803
I must conclude it is true.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.675
If it is true, Father,

06:27.513 --> 06:30.643
what would it mean

06:31.976 --> 06:33.386
for the Jesuits?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.519
For the whole of Catholic Europe?

06:36.647 --> 06:40.027
It seems to me that our mission here
is more urgent than ever.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.649
We must go find Father Ferreira.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.156
I cannot allow that.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.083
How... How can we
abandon our mission?

06:54.165 --> 06:57.125
Your mission, Father Garupe,
was to find word of Ferreira.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.630
You have found it.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.459
Excuse me, Father,

07:01.547 --> 07:05.007
but this letter
relates the most terrible history,

07:05.093 --> 07:07.933
but it says nothing of Ferreira himself.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.682
Whatever happened to him
is still unknown.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.980
All that we know of his fate,

07:13.059 --> 07:15.519
is this one slander.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.816
Permit me, Father Valignano, but...

07:20.691 --> 07:24.571
I... I believe our mission still stands.

07:30.034 --> 07:35.214
Do you know how many Christians
the authorities executed in Shimabara?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.706
Thousands.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.541
Tens of thousands,

07:38.626 --> 07:40.036
most of them beheaded.

07:40.378 --> 07:41.958
No, it's far too dangerous for you.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.456
Yes, but, Father,

07:43.548 --> 07:46.088
how do we neglect the man
that nurtured us in the faith?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.887
He shaped the world for us.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.755
And even if the slander should be true,

07:50.847 --> 07:52.597
then Father Ferreira is damned.

07:52.682 --> 07:53.932
Yes.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.436
We have no choice, but to save his soul.

07:58.855 --> 08:01.145
This is in your hearts, then?
Both of you?

08:01.232 --> 08:02.402
- Yes.
- It is.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.605
Like our first fervor.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.290
Then I must trust God has put it there.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.253
He calls you to a great trial.

08:17.373 --> 08:20.503
The moment you set foot in that country,

08:20.585 --> 08:22.545
you step into high danger.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.973
You will be the last two priests to go.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.925
<i>An army of two.</i>

08:32.722 --> 08:34.852
<i>May 25th, 1640.</i>

08:34.932 --> 08:36.142
Pax Christi...

08:36.225 --> 08:38.015
<i>God be praised.</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:40.522
<i>Father Valignano, as I begin these lines,</i>

08:40.605 --> 08:42.184
<i>I cannot be sure
that when they are done</i>

08:42.273 --> 08:43.613
<i>they will ever reach you.</i>

08:44.442 --> 08:46.942
<i>But I want to maintain
your confidence in our mission</i>

08:47.987 --> 08:50.407
<i>and vindicate your faith in us.</i>

08:50.489 --> 08:51.659
Careful.

08:51.741 --> 08:54.041
<i>Today,
there was wonderful news.</i>

08:54.118 --> 08:57.328
<i>Your Mr. Chun
has found us a Chinese boat.</i>

08:57.413 --> 08:59.833
<i>It will smuggle us into Japan.</i>

08:59.916 --> 09:03.956
<i>And he claims he's found
the only Japanese in Macau,</i>

09:04.462 --> 09:07.012
<i>to be our most valued guide
in that country.</i>

09:07.089 --> 09:08.629
Come on, this way.

09:18.643 --> 09:22.233
<i>Finally, we meet our first Japanese.</i>

09:22.313 --> 09:24.943
He's not much, you will see.

09:25.024 --> 09:28.154
But after almost two months,
he's the only one.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.498
Hey.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.209
Hey, wake up.

09:47.797 --> 09:49.597
Come on, get up.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.232
He was drifting on sea,
Portuguese bring him.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.354
He's stuck here, wants to go home.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.279
Is he... Are you really Japanese?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.777
Answer them, you fool.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.492
These are <i>padres.</i>

10:15.574 --> 10:16.954
Kichijiro!

10:18.327 --> 10:20.327
You fool, they will take you home!

10:23.708 --> 10:25.208
Where is your home?

10:26.919 --> 10:28.499
Nagasaki.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.134
What's your work?

10:31.215 --> 10:33.005
He will do what you say.

10:33.384 --> 10:34.724
Fisherman.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.718
You know our language?

10:39.932 --> 10:41.102
Little.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.273
Yes. Little.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.480
You learned it from the Jesuit <i>padres.</i>

10:47.565 --> 10:50.105
You must have, so you're Christian?

10:50.526 --> 10:51.566
No!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.488
No Christian.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.913
Good guide for you. He's Christian, too.

10:59.285 --> 11:01.535
I'm not Christian!

11:02.455 --> 11:04.075
Christian die!

11:06.125 --> 11:07.585
They...

11:07.668 --> 11:09.668
They die in Nagasaki.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.303
Listen to me.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.261
We have money.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.470
If you can help us,
we can take you home.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.887
We can take you home to Japan.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.845
Would you like to go home to Japan?

11:26.062 --> 11:27.312
I want...

11:28.397 --> 11:29.647
I want to go home.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.107
Not for money.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.356
Japan is the country of my family!

11:36.697 --> 11:37.817
I beg you.

11:38.157 --> 11:39.987
Don't abandon me here, Father.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.826
Please!

11:43.871 --> 11:45.331
Take me home.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.786
He will be good guide.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.500
Promise me.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.507
- I'll clean him up.
- They take me home!

11:54.590 --> 11:55.930
Promise me.

12:08.938 --> 12:10.058
Our guide...

12:10.815 --> 12:12.525
He can't be Christian.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.445
He says he's not,
but can you believe anything he says?

12:17.655 --> 12:20.155
I don't even want to believe
he's Japanese.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.962
<i>And He said to them,
"Go ye into the whole world</i>

12:27.039 --> 12:30.209
<i>"and preach the gospel
to every living creature,</i>

12:30.292 --> 12:32.552
<i>"even to one such as this."</i>

12:33.546 --> 12:35.876
<i>So our Lord commanded,</i>

12:35.965 --> 12:39.635
<i>and as I prepare to do His work,
I see His face before me.</i>

12:41.512 --> 12:45.142
<i>He looks as He must have
when He commanded Peter,</i>

12:46.350 --> 12:47.980
<i>"Feed my lambs,</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:50.520
<i>"feed my lambs, feed my sheep."</i>

12:51.981 --> 12:54.571
<i>It fascinates me.</i>

12:54.650 --> 12:56.860
<i>I feel such great love for it.</i>

13:03.742 --> 13:07.412
<i>Garupe and I had
absolutely no luggage to bring to Japan,</i>

13:07.496 --> 13:09.326
<i>except our own hearts.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:13.460
<i>And during the calm
and storm of the voyage,</i>

13:13.544 --> 13:16.924
<i>I reflected upon the 20 years
which has passed</i>

13:17.006 --> 13:19.506
<i>since the persecution has broken out.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:23.011
<i>The black soil of Japan</i>

13:23.095 --> 13:26.805
<i>is filled with the wailing
of so many Christians.</i>

13:28.058 --> 13:31.398
<i>The red blood of priests
has flowed profusely.</i>

13:32.563 --> 13:35.823
<i>The walls of the churches
have fallen down.</i>

13:48.162 --> 13:49.582
<i>Shaba.</i>

14:00.883 --> 14:02.843
We've trusted that man with our lives.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.558
Jesus trusted even worse.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.887
Hurry.

14:10.893 --> 14:11.943
Come.

14:28.953 --> 14:30.583
Here, here!

14:30.663 --> 14:32.373
Kichijiro,
where are you going?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.384
Kichijiro!

14:38.837 --> 14:40.707
He's going to betray us.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.104
Kichijiro!

14:58.065 --> 15:00.605
Fact is fact.
What you will do, do quickly.

15:56.457 --> 15:57.827
<i>Padre?</i>

16:10.846 --> 16:12.966
Hurry. We have no time.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.677
No time! Come, come, come.

16:18.646 --> 16:19.896
What is this place?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.902
Tomogi place.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.361
- Japan?
- Please be quick!

16:24.693 --> 16:27.953
So gentiles cannot see you. So, come.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.070
- Gentiles?
- Yes.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.866
Come, come. Quickly!

16:30.949 --> 16:32.489
Quick!

16:33.285 --> 16:34.285
Come!

16:38.123 --> 16:39.753
I'm sorry, <i>Padre.</i>

16:40.167 --> 16:45.337
Too dangerous.
There are more executions than ever.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.802
If they know we're Christian,
we will be killed.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.894
The Lord hears you.

16:51.762 --> 16:52.932
Yes.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.393
He sent you to us.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.940
Please.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.287
Please. Enter, enter.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.352
Oh. Thank you.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.349
We have little food, if you'd like.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.024
You will be safe here until morning.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.526
Sit, sit! Please.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.317
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.497
How do you live like this?

17:59.663 --> 18:02.923
I mean, how do you live as Christians

18:03.333 --> 18:06.883
when the danger is so great?

18:07.045 --> 18:09.005
You understand?

18:09.423 --> 18:11.883
We pray in secret,

18:12.009 --> 18:13.929
but we have our <i>Jiisama.</i>

18:14.344 --> 18:16.184
<i>- Jiisama?
- Jiisama.</i>

18:16.513 --> 18:17.513
<i>Jiisama.</i>

18:18.015 --> 18:19.805
Who is the <i>Jiisama?</i>

18:28.317 --> 18:29.317
You lead them?

18:29.735 --> 18:31.235
You lead the village?

18:31.361 --> 18:34.321
- In prayer, in devotions?
<i>- Padre,</i> too.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.867
<i>The only sacrament
he can perform is baptism.</i>

18:43.499 --> 18:45.879
<i>We worship with the</i> Jiisama.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.463
<i>We hide the Christian images.</i>

18:48.545 --> 18:49.755
<i>Amen.</i>

18:49.838 --> 18:51.668
But God still sees us.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.216
- Yes?
- Yes.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.048
Even though we do not have a priest

18:57.137 --> 18:58.507
until now.

19:00.891 --> 19:03.981
Ah! Please eat!

19:06.855 --> 19:08.895
Please eat.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.319
Thank you.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.575
Amen.

19:27.584 --> 19:31.174
Every Christian here
is part of our secret church.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.509
This... This faith...

19:34.591 --> 19:37.761
This faith you have is so strong.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.720
You have such courage.

19:40.722 --> 19:46.192
Is it only here that there is such faith
or in other villages, too?

19:46.603 --> 19:50.113
We do not know about other villages.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.782
We never go there.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.904
Mmm, you don't go?

19:55.362 --> 19:58.372
Other villages are so dangerous.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.238
You do not know who to trust.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.620
Everyone fears the Inquisitor

20:04.705 --> 20:06.705
Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:08.787
Inform on Christian,

20:08.876 --> 20:11.296
and they give you 100 pieces of silver.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.970
200 for a Christian brother.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.433
And for a priest, 300.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.309
Three hundred?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.978
You must go to the other villages.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.725
You must let them know
that priests are here again.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.816
That we are here in Japan, again,
it will be good.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.699
There was a, um, a <i>padre,</i>

20:42.993 --> 20:46.203
who was here called Ferreira.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.749
Father Ferreira.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.502
Have you heard of him?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.210
Like us.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.548
- No.
- No?

21:02.512 --> 21:03.682
You do not eat?

21:07.267 --> 21:11.187
It is you who feed us.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.262
<i>They do not dare take us
anywhere by the main road.</i>

22:22.300 --> 22:25.800
<i>To hide like this
must be a terrible burden.</i>

22:26.930 --> 22:30.640
<i>I was overwhelmed by the love
I felt from these people,</i>

22:30.934 --> 22:33.604
<i>even though their faces couldn't show it.</i>

22:34.688 --> 22:38.528
<i>Long years of secrecy
have made their faces into masks.</i>

22:39.693 --> 22:42.203
<i>Why do they have to suffer so much?</i>

22:43.196 --> 22:46.236
<i>Why did God make them
to bear such a burden?</i>

22:47.534 --> 22:49.494
This is the safest here.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.334
This hut for making charcoal.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.133
<i>When you hear this sound...</i>

23:01.381 --> 23:03.631
It will be us.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.177
If you hear anything else...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.154
Hide.

23:23.236 --> 23:26.196
<i>During the day, we keep
the door of our hut tightly closed</i>

23:27.324 --> 23:31.374
<i>and refrain from the slightest noise
lest anyone passing outside may hear it.</i>

23:33.663 --> 23:36.083
<i>Only the dark makes it safe for us</i>

23:36.166 --> 23:39.746
<i>to go down into the village
and minister to the faithful.</i>

23:43.924 --> 23:45.014
<i>Padre!</i>

23:46.259 --> 23:47.389
Please!

23:47.511 --> 23:50.601
<i>Finally, they had priests
to forgive their sins.</i>

23:54.267 --> 23:55.887
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i>

23:56.353 --> 23:58.363
for I have sinned.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.360
- Confession.
- I have sinned.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.352
<i>We heard their confessions all night.</i>

24:19.376 --> 24:21.166
But then, <i>Padre...</i>

24:21.253 --> 24:23.343
<i>Even though we could not
always be sure</i>

24:23.421 --> 24:24.971
<i>what was being confessed.</i>

24:28.426 --> 24:31.426
<i>And now, Christianity brought love.</i>

24:33.056 --> 24:35.266
<i>The dignity for the first time</i>

24:35.392 --> 24:38.402
<i>of being treated like
God's creatures, not animals.</i>

24:38.645 --> 24:43.225
<i>And the promise that all their suffering
would not end in nothingness,</i>

24:43.984 --> 24:46.244
<i>but in salvation.</i>

24:49.239 --> 24:51.909
<i>We offer mass in the dead of night,</i>

24:52.284 --> 24:54.494
<i>just as they did in the Catacombs.</i>

24:55.078 --> 24:56.578
<i>Quietly.</i>

24:56.663 --> 25:00.633
<i>In nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

25:01.126 --> 25:02.126
Amen.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.279
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.952
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.621
We now always God in <i>paraíso?</i>

25:41.041 --> 25:42.631
<i>Paraíso?</i>

25:42.709 --> 25:44.129
- Yes.
- Paradise?

25:44.211 --> 25:45.591
Yes, paradise.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.455
- Now?
- Yes.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.427
No.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.549
No.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.848
But God is there now.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.682
And forever.

25:59.184 --> 26:02.024
He prepares a place
for us all, even now.

26:12.822 --> 26:15.162
I'm sorry, Sebastião, for my impatience.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.411
I'm ashamed of my frustration.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.955
The child is safe
in the grace of God now

26:24.042 --> 26:25.542
and that is what is important.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.172
And you're a bad Jesuit.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.627
Hmm.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.228
Sick of being trapped in here all day.

26:50.568 --> 26:51.608
Eat.

26:52.404 --> 26:55.454
We don't even know
if Father Ferreira is alive or dead.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.952
The villagers never even heard of him.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.075
These people are so frightened.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.670
There's fear over their head, and lice.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.629
They have us, we comfort them.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.296
How much longer can we do that?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.932
We asked for this mission, Francisco.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.054
We prayed for this in the exercises.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.597
God heard us then,
and He hears us now.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.141
Well, then, may He guide us to Ferreira
so we can know the truth.

27:27.022 --> 27:29.362
You think it's possible
that his strength gave out

27:29.441 --> 27:31.531
and he groveled to this Inquisitor Inoue,

27:31.609 --> 27:33.819
went on his knees like a dog?

27:33.903 --> 27:35.613
That's still just a rumor.

27:36.323 --> 27:38.993
Even if this Inoue
is the devil everyone claims,

27:39.075 --> 27:41.115
Ferreira would stand up to him.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.921
One of us must go to Nagasaki
and find him.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.174
It's too dangerous.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.759
For us, for the people who shelter us.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.466
We send Kichijiro,
he brings back word we can act on.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.764
Are you mad?

28:01.431 --> 28:02.891
Where is he?

28:02.974 --> 28:04.354
He's never here.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.518
He's always drunk,
you know he can't be trusted.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.614
What do we do?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.448
We must do something
to find Father Ferreira.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.829
Let's go out.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.124
Let's risk it.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.577
Just for a moment.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.888
Look.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.610
That's God's sign.

29:07.497 --> 29:08.667
Don't move.

29:11.501 --> 29:13.341
Someone's here watching us.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.331
<i>Padre?</i>

29:54.169 --> 29:55.249
<i>Padre?</i>

30:00.550 --> 30:02.760
No, no, no. That's not the signal.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.986
<i>Padre.</i>

30:23.907 --> 30:26.867
Do not be afraid. It's all right.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.616
We won't hurt you.

30:31.456 --> 30:34.916
We Christian, <i>Padre.</i> Christian!

30:35.502 --> 30:36.962
Christian.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.842
We need you.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.096
No, no!

30:54.479 --> 30:56.939
Sebastião, hey! No! Sebastião!

31:00.443 --> 31:01.953
<i>Padre.</i>

31:04.781 --> 31:07.781
We have frightened you. We are sorry.

31:10.203 --> 31:14.833
We want to ask you to come
to our village. To Gotō.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.877
People miss our faith there.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.297
Our children need you.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.470
We have no mass, no confession.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.643
All we can do is pray.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.080
<i>How did you know
we were here?</i>

31:37.146 --> 31:39.896
Who told you?
Was it one of the faithful?

31:42.944 --> 31:46.744
It was a Christian
of our village. Kichijiro.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.533
Kichijiro?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.709
Our... Our Kichijiro?

31:55.582 --> 31:57.382
He said he came here.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.293
With you.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.168
Yes, but he's not a Christian.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.012
Yes, he is.

32:05.466 --> 32:09.596
It's true.
He spoke against God to the Inquisitor,

32:09.679 --> 32:10.849
Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

32:11.347 --> 32:13.977
<i>But that was eight years ago.</i>

32:24.861 --> 32:27.241
<i>His whole family was put to death.</i>

32:28.364 --> 32:30.204
He spoke against God.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.536
But he still believes.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.416
<i>No. No.</i>

32:38.541 --> 32:40.381
They need priests on Gotō.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.460
No, <i>Padre.</i>

32:41.544 --> 32:43.188
But, MOKICHI,
we will return here.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.107
- No, no, <i>Padre.</i>
- We will return here.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.471
I do not know
the people of Gotō.

32:48.551 --> 32:52.011
So I do not know they can be trusted.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.638
These are Christians. Like us.

32:54.766 --> 32:56.886
Kichijiro told them to come here.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.023
I'm not sure why.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.523
Why does he do anything?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.515
Kichijiro brought us here to Tomogi.

33:06.069 --> 33:08.109
It'll only be for a few days.

33:11.407 --> 33:16.367
But one will stay here? Please.

33:19.624 --> 33:20.634
- Huh.
- Yes.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.216
We're losing them.

35:16.491 --> 35:17.581
That's right.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.589
<i>The fear I'd felt
on the journey faded away.</i>

35:36.719 --> 35:40.559
<i>Because the joy which greeted me
was almost as great as my own.</i>

35:43.351 --> 35:46.811
<i>Even the sight of Kichijiro
was somehow welcome.</i>

35:50.399 --> 35:51.529
Come.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.899
<i>I thanked God
for bringing me here.</i>

36:02.620 --> 36:05.750
<i>On that day, the faithful
received fresh hope.</i>

36:07.750 --> 36:09.090
<i>And I was renewed.</i>

36:21.264 --> 36:23.024
<i>And they came to me.</i>

36:24.851 --> 36:28.351
<i>Not only from Gotō,
for the Christians made their way</i>

36:28.437 --> 36:30.607
<i>through the mountains
from other villages.</i>

36:32.108 --> 36:34.438
<i>I felt God Himself was so near.</i>

36:35.653 --> 36:37.863
<i>Their lives here are so hard.</i>

36:37.947 --> 36:40.317
<i>They live like beasts
and die like beasts.</i>

36:42.118 --> 36:45.708
<i>But Christ did not die
for the good and beautiful.</i>

36:45.788 --> 36:47.538
<i>That is easy enough.</i>

36:47.623 --> 36:51.843
<i>The hard thing is to die
for the miserable and corrupt.</i>

36:53.504 --> 36:56.134
<i>But here, I knew I was one of them</i>

36:56.632 --> 36:59.302
<i>and I shared the hunger of their spirit.</i>

37:03.514 --> 37:05.394
<i>Another prayer was answered on Gotō.</i>

37:06.976 --> 37:09.266
<i>It was there I learned the first real news</i>

37:09.353 --> 37:11.983
<i>of someone who might know
of Father Ferreira.</i>

37:12.064 --> 37:13.074
Oh.

37:13.482 --> 37:14.942
<i>Padre</i> Ferreira.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.396
<i>Padre</i> Ferreira.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.112
- Yes, do you know him?
- Yes.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.275
- You know him?
- Yes.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.823
- You've seen him?
- Yes.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.794
When?

37:25.828 --> 37:28.748
He made a pray for infant and the...

37:28.831 --> 37:30.421
- Infant.
- Eu-fot?

37:30.499 --> 37:31.539
Infant.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.919
- Baby! Baby!
- Infant.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.253
- Yeah!
- Sorry, infant.

37:35.338 --> 37:37.338
And, uh, sick, sick.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.127
At, uh, Shimachi.

37:40.718 --> 37:42.638
- Shimachi. Shimachi.
- Shimachi.

37:43.346 --> 37:47.516
But, uh, that was before the trouble.

37:48.726 --> 37:49.766
Oh, where is this?

37:49.852 --> 37:52.692
- Near Nagasaki. Nagasaki.
- Nagasaki.

37:53.022 --> 37:56.032
But so dangerous. Dangerous to go.

37:56.984 --> 37:58.954
No?

37:59.028 --> 38:00.589
I don't know. I don't know.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.528
<i>They are desperate
for tangible signs of faith.</i>

38:06.327 --> 38:07.997
<i>So I provided what I could.</i>

38:09.747 --> 38:12.497
<i>I worry they value
these poor signs of faith</i>

38:12.583 --> 38:14.043
<i>more than faith itself.</i>

38:16.170 --> 38:18.170
<i>But how could we deny them?</i>

38:19.757 --> 38:22.757
<i>And finally, I had to part with my rosary.</i>

38:41.904 --> 38:43.284
Kichijiro!

38:43.614 --> 38:44.914
Kichijiro!

38:47.868 --> 38:50.658
<i>In Gotō,
I was completely overwhelmed.</i>

38:50.746 --> 38:55.246
<i>I baptized over 100 adults and children,
heard confessions without number.</i>

38:56.043 --> 39:00.423
<i>But it was from Kichijiro
that I felt the greatest need.</i>

39:03.426 --> 39:05.086
You did not take the rosary.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.296
I did not deserve it.

39:08.222 --> 39:09.272
Why?

39:11.267 --> 39:12.687
'Cause you denied God?

39:13.394 --> 39:14.444
Yes.

39:18.149 --> 39:19.569
<i>But only to live!</i>

39:21.110 --> 39:22.700
<i>My whole family...</i>

39:22.778 --> 39:24.568
<i>The Inquisitor, Inoue,</i>

39:24.655 --> 39:27.155
wanted us to give up our faith.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.794
Stamp on Jesus with our foot.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.119
Just once, just pressed.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.464
But they would not.

39:41.297 --> 39:44.257
But I did.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.015
<i>But I could not abandon them,</i>

39:59.148 --> 40:01.608
even if I had abandoned God.

40:08.908 --> 40:11.618
<i>So I watched them die.</i>

40:17.500 --> 40:19.420
<i>Wherever I go,</i>

40:19.502 --> 40:23.132
<i>I see the fire and smell the flesh.</i>

40:24.256 --> 40:29.006
<i>When I saw you and</i> Padre <i>Garupe,
for the first time,</i>

40:29.845 --> 40:31.135
<i>I started to believe</i>

40:33.224 --> 40:35.354
that God might take me back!

40:37.812 --> 40:40.612
Because in my dreams

40:42.566 --> 40:45.566
the fire was no longer so bright!

41:03.879 --> 41:06.219
You want me to hear
your confession now?

41:15.558 --> 41:17.058
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i>

41:19.478 --> 41:20.728
for I have sinned.

41:30.656 --> 41:35.076
<i>Those six days at Gotō
and Kichijiro's renewal of faith</i>

41:35.369 --> 41:38.039
<i>made me feel that my life was of value</i>

41:38.539 --> 41:41.919
<i>and that I could really be of use
to people in this country</i>

41:42.001 --> 41:43.251
<i>at the ends of the Earth.</i>

41:48.048 --> 41:51.928
Men from the Inquisitor,
they are in the village.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.512
They took Ichizo.

45:23.013 --> 45:26.393
No, we are
not afraid to die, <i>Padres,</i>

45:26.517 --> 45:28.517
and we will never surrender you.

45:28.602 --> 45:30.022
No one should die.

45:30.104 --> 45:33.574
No. But we will be in danger
whether you go or stay.

45:33.649 --> 45:35.439
So stay. Stay.

45:36.318 --> 45:37.528
We will never surrender you.

45:37.611 --> 45:40.031
They'll keep coming back if we stay.

45:40.114 --> 45:42.875
They could destroy the entire village
and kill you all, while we hide.

45:42.908 --> 45:44.158
No.

45:44.243 --> 45:46.753
Yes, we have no choice, Mokichi.
It is the only thing to do.

45:46.829 --> 45:48.659
This will draw the danger
away from you.

45:49.581 --> 45:51.501
We can hide on Kichijiro's island.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.090
My island?

45:57.756 --> 46:01.836
No. There is no difference
between there and here.

46:02.010 --> 46:04.180
They will come to Gotō.
They will search.

46:05.180 --> 46:07.020
Same thing will happen.

46:45.387 --> 46:47.007
You will stay.

46:54.271 --> 46:57.361
Me, Mokichi,

46:57.441 --> 46:59.571
and two more hostages.

48:05.801 --> 48:08.011
I'm not an informer!

48:08.303 --> 48:09.813
I confessed all my sins.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.236
Hey!

48:46.300 --> 48:47.340
<i>Padre?</i>

48:54.683 --> 48:55.683
<i>Pa... Padre.</i>

48:57.185 --> 49:01.145
If we are forced to trample

49:01.565 --> 49:04.685
on the Lord, on the <i>fumie...</i>

49:08.196 --> 49:10.276
You must pray for courage, Mokichi.

49:10.866 --> 49:12.526
But if we do not do what they want,

49:13.327 --> 49:16.037
then it can be danger
for everyone in the village.

49:16.246 --> 49:17.866
They can be put in prison!

49:18.457 --> 49:19.707
Taken away forever.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.379
What should we do?

49:23.795 --> 49:25.295
Trample.

49:25.589 --> 49:26.799
Trample.

49:28.258 --> 49:29.678
It's all right to trample.

49:31.595 --> 49:32.885
What are you saying?

49:35.265 --> 49:36.265
You can't!

49:38.560 --> 49:41.610
Mokichi, you can't.

49:58.121 --> 49:59.121
Amen.

50:13.970 --> 50:15.850
I make this for the <i>Jiisama.</i>

50:17.099 --> 50:18.429
It was all we had.

50:20.018 --> 50:21.268
Until you came.

50:23.772 --> 50:26.612
Take this. Please.

50:29.277 --> 50:30.647
In Jesus' name.

50:35.951 --> 50:39.661
Your faith gives me strength, Mokichi.

50:40.914 --> 50:44.134
I wish I could give as much to you.

50:45.127 --> 50:46.627
My love for God is strong.

50:49.089 --> 50:50.799
Could that be the same as faith?

50:53.093 --> 50:54.143
Yes.

50:56.430 --> 50:58.470
Yes. I think it must be.

51:14.322 --> 51:15.572
<i>These people</i>

51:15.657 --> 51:18.617
<i>are the most devoted
of God's creatures on Earth.</i>

51:20.620 --> 51:23.960
<i>Father Valignano, I confess,
I began to wonder.</i>

51:25.167 --> 51:29.757
<i>God sends us trials to test us
and everything He does is good.</i>

51:29.838 --> 51:32.838
<i>And I prayed to undergo trials
like his son.</i>

51:33.884 --> 51:37.434
<i>But why must their trial be so terrible?</i>

51:41.057 --> 51:43.557
<i>And why, when I look in my own heart,</i>

51:44.811 --> 51:47.981
<i>do the answers I give them
seem so weak?</i>

52:44.454 --> 52:46.934
<i>All of them
did as they were commanded.</i>

52:48.166 --> 52:49.536
<i>But it was not enough.</i>

54:39.361 --> 54:41.951
<i>Old Ichizo would not do it.</i>

54:42.072 --> 54:43.702
<i>Mokichi could not.</i>

54:45.116 --> 54:47.536
<i>But Kichijiro succeeded
where the rest failed.</i>

54:49.371 --> 54:52.041
<i>I must believe he suffered
along with the others.</i>

55:36.668 --> 55:38.428
<i>They were given sake,</i>

55:39.087 --> 55:42.417
<i>as the Roman soldier
offered vinegar to the dying Christ.</i>

55:46.928 --> 55:49.468
<i>I prayed they remembered
our Lord's suffering</i>

55:50.306 --> 55:52.426
<i>and took courage and comfort from it.</i>

58:21.875 --> 58:24.165
<i>It took Mokichi four days to die.</i>

58:30.508 --> 58:32.428
<i>At the end, he sang a hymn.</i>

58:33.803 --> 58:35.933
<i>His voice was the only sound.</i>

58:36.931 --> 58:38.271
<i>The people of the village</i>

58:38.349 --> 58:41.269
<i>who were gathered on the beach
were always silent.</i>

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.591
<i>The people were watched closely</i>

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:38.217
<i>so the bodies could not be
given a Christian burial.</i>

01:00:41.723 --> 01:00:44.143
<i>Mokichi's body
was so heavy with water,</i>

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:47.765
<i>it turned the flames to smoke
before it finally caught fire.</i>

01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:53.275
<i>Any bones that remained
were scattered in the ocean</i>

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:55.401
<i>so they could not be venerated.</i>

01:01:04.746 --> 01:01:08.996
<i>Father Valignano, you will say
that their death is not meaningless.</i>

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.923
<i>Surely God heard their prayers
as they died.</i>

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:14.797
<i>But did He hear their screams?</i>

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:18.718
<i>How can I explain His silence
to these people</i>

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.851
<i>who have endured so much?</i>

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:25.017
<i>I need all my strength
to understand it myself.</i>

01:01:27.435 --> 01:01:30.225
<i>This may be my last report
to you, Father.</i>

01:01:30.313 --> 01:01:33.653
<i>Today we hear the guards
are in the mountains looking for us.</i>

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:37.570
<i>So we have decided
it will be safer to separate.</i>

01:01:37.653 --> 01:01:39.613
They were right.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:41.777
If we left, they might still be alive.

01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:43.177
Don't say that. That's not true.

01:01:43.201 --> 01:01:45.411
And we cannot doubt,
that will be our death.

01:01:45.495 --> 01:01:46.764
Are we giving up?
Is that what we are doing?

01:01:46.788 --> 01:01:48.208
- Are we running away?
- No.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:49.489
After people have died for us.

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.131
They did not die for us.

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:53.039
Garupe, they did not die for us.

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:56.134
I feel like a coward.

01:02:06.808 --> 01:02:08.098
My love goes with you.

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:09.983
I pray to be as strong as you.

01:02:17.819 --> 01:02:21.859
<i>Father Garupe will make
for Hirado to continue the mission.</i>

01:02:21.948 --> 01:02:23.028
<i>And I will return to Gotō.</i>

01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:25.953
Francisco, stay alive.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.870
Stay alive.

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:34.044
<i>Father, I ask forgiveness
for my weakness and my doubt.</i>

01:02:35.545 --> 01:02:37.835
<i>And I ask you to remember
Father Garupe and me</i>

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.922
<i>in your masses and in your prayers.</i>

01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:44.255
<i>Your obedient son.</i>

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.033
<i>I imagine your Son</i>

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:07.033
<i>nailed to the cross.</i>

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.833
<i>My mouth tastes like vinegar.</i>

01:03:21.674 --> 01:03:23.304
Is that Gotō?

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.640
Is that Gotō?

01:03:35.605 --> 01:03:37.895
<i>Father in heaven, praised be thy name.</i>

01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:41.443
<i>I'm just a foreigner
who brought disaster.</i>

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:44.413
<i>And that's what they think of me now.</i>

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:50.931
<i>I dream of our St. Francis.</i>

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.230
<i>What happened to all the glorious
possibility he found here?</i>

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:03.234
<i>What have I done for Christ?</i>

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.740
<i>What am I doing for Christ?</i>

01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:10.279
<i>What will I do for Christ?</i>

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.545
<i>I feel so tempted.</i>

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.800
<i>I feel so tempted to despair.</i>

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.263
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.968
<i>The weight of your silence is terrible.</i>

01:05:34.682 --> 01:05:36.482
<i>I pray, but I'm lost.</i>

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:41.904
<i>Or am I just praying to nothing?</i>

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.820
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:48.859
<i>Because you are not there.</i>

01:06:26.484 --> 01:06:28.404
<i>I pray for your forgiveness.</i>

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:50.126
<i>If my report now comes
to an abrupt end,</i>

01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:51.966
<i>do not think that we are dead.</i>

01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:55.719
<i>Forif Garupe and I die,</i>

01:06:55.805 --> 01:06:58.135
<i>the Japanese church dies with us.</i>

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:12.946
Ah!

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.290
I thought I was being followed.

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:26.841
Are you all right, <i>Padre?</i>

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:29.804
Sorry.

01:07:42.268 --> 01:07:43.268
<i>Padre?</i>

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.355
Why did you come back here, <i>Padre?</i>

01:07:50.443 --> 01:07:52.193
This place is dangerous.

01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:55.661
We must be careful.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.080
There is a price
of 300 pieces of silver for you.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.700
Three hundred.

01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:03.115
Judas got only 30.

01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:07.041
There are Christians near the villages.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:08.496
Not far.

01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:14.934
We can hide there.
I will take care of you.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.401
Take it. Please.

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.185
You must be so hungry.

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:53.011
Mokichi and my family stayed strong.

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:55.546
I am so weak.

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:57.675
Are you?

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.180
You can certainly look after yourself.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.602
Not to be selfish.

01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:04.354
I am like you.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.345
I have nowhere else to go.

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:11.978
Where is the place for a weak man

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.990
in a world like this?

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.923
You want to confess
for Mokichi and Ichizo?

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:48.852
<i>"What you will do, do quickly."</i>

01:09:49.812 --> 01:09:52.732
<i>Your Son's words to Judas
at the Last Supper.</i>

01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:56.437
<i>Was he angry when he said them?</i>

01:09:58.279 --> 01:09:59.859
<i>Or did they come from love?</i>

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.870
Are you all right, <i>Padre?</i>

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.990
- You seem so tired.
- I'm all right.

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:08.368
The fish you gave me was so salty.

01:10:08.914 --> 01:10:10.584
I thirst.

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:12.962
- What?
- I thirst.

01:10:15.296 --> 01:10:17.456
- Our Lord said that.
- Yes.

01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.591
- I get some water.
- Ah.

01:10:20.676 --> 01:10:21.676
Kichi...

01:10:23.012 --> 01:10:25.012
- I get water.
- Kichijiro!

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:29.557
Kichijiro.

01:10:40.863 --> 01:10:43.073
Oh. Sorry, I dropped the water, <i>Padre.</i>

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:45.082
I thought something was wrong.

01:10:46.035 --> 01:10:47.615
But, never mind.

01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:49.656
There is a stream just nearby.

01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:51.995
You can drink as much as you like.

01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:56.961
Here.

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:30.428
<i>Padre,</i> forgive me.

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:35.806
<i>Padre?</i>

01:12:43.235 --> 01:12:45.445
I pray for God's forgiveness.

01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:50.698
Will he forgive? Even me?

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.200
Blessed be God.

01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:39.626
What is... What is your name?

01:13:40.084 --> 01:13:41.754
- Monica.
- Ah.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:43.995
Like the mother of Augustine.

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:46.048
My baptismal name.

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:47.841
This man is Juan.

01:13:49.635 --> 01:13:52.885
He wanted his name
to be like our priest Juan,

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:55.271
who died at Unzen.

01:13:57.309 --> 01:13:59.599
There will be many more joining him.

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.821
You understand.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:10.994
Why are you...
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:14:13.033 --> 01:14:14.543
Why are you so calm?

01:14:15.828 --> 01:14:18.618
We are all about to die!

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.870
Like that!

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.219
I'm sorry.

01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:36.521
I'm sorry. Thank you.
Thank you for the food.

01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:41.729
<i>Padre...</i>

01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:43.692
Our father,

01:14:43.772 --> 01:14:46.532
<i>Padre</i> Juan said if we die,

01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:48.938
we will go to <i>paraíso.</i>

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.027
Paradise.

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:52.317
Yes, that's right.

01:14:52.406 --> 01:14:54.116
Isn't it good to die?

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:56.869
<i>Paraíso</i> is so much better than here.

01:14:56.952 --> 01:14:58.372
No one hungry.

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:01.832
Never sick. No taxes. No hard work.

01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:04.962
Yes. Of course.

01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:09.049
<i>Padre</i> Juan was right.

01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:13.551
There is no hard work in <i>paraíso.</i>

01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:16.425
There is no work at all.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:18.933
There is no taxes.

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:22.055
There is no suffering.

01:15:22.436 --> 01:15:25.306
We all will be united with God.

01:15:25.397 --> 01:15:27.857
There will be no pain.

01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:03.116
No, not you.

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:04.663
You stay.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.220
You understood
what I was saying to them?

01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:24.472
Your Japanese is good enough?

01:17:26.435 --> 01:17:28.685
- I saw your eyes.
- Oh.

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:32.903
And what did you think you saw there?

01:17:36.737 --> 01:17:37.987
They're fools.

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:39.911
Those peasants.

01:17:41.575 --> 01:17:45.495
<i>Lord, spare them suffering
and keep them safe in Your hand.</i>

01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:48.829
They can talk among themselves
without end.

01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:51.335
And decide nothing.

01:17:52.294 --> 01:17:54.804
But you understand, don't you?

01:17:57.758 --> 01:17:59.088
Just say what you mean.

01:17:59.968 --> 01:18:03.808
That it all depends on you
whether they are set free,

01:18:04.765 --> 01:18:07.425
if you say just one single word.

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:09.101
Show them.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:11.266
Deny your faith.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.530
So what if I refuse?

01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:16.819
You kill me?

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:20.452
The blood of martyrs
is the seed of the church.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:25.041
Just like the priests you slaughtered
in Ōmura and Nagasaki.

01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:27.248
We learned from our mistake.

01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:31.959
Killing the priests
and killing the peasants makes it worse.

01:18:33.293 --> 01:18:38.723
If they can die for their God,
they think it only makes them stronger.

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:43.716
If you feel you must punish someone,
punish me alone.

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.310
You do not speak like a good priest!

01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:57.226
If you were a real man,
a truly good priest,

01:18:57.317 --> 01:19:00.317
you should feel pity for the Christian.

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:03.824
Isn't that so, <i>Padre,</i> isn't that so?

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.996
The price for your glory
is their suffering.

01:19:41.987 --> 01:19:43.697
<i>Padre,</i>

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:46.367
praise be to God, our Father.

01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:49.702
Praise be to Him.

01:19:52.706 --> 01:19:56.376
The Portuguese language was a gift
of your Father Cabral.

01:19:57.878 --> 01:20:00.878
I have been asked to interpret
on your behalf.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:08.507
There was concern that we might miss
certain subtleties in your testimony

01:20:08.597 --> 01:20:11.387
if you were told to speak
only in Japanese.

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:13.475
Testimony? Uh...

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.600
We want it to be fair.

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:16.979
And we do have
a better grasp of your language

01:20:17.063 --> 01:20:18.613
than you do of ours.

01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:23.736
Father Cabral never managed
much more than <i>arigataya.</i>

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:28.834
All the time he lived here,
he taught, but would not learn.

01:20:28.909 --> 01:20:33.369
He despised our language,
our food, our customs.

01:20:33.455 --> 01:20:35.745
I'm not like him. I'm not like Cabral.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:38.292
- Really?
- Yes.

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:42.379
We have our own religion, <i>Padre.</i>

01:20:42.464 --> 01:20:44.674
Pity you did not know this yet.

01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:47.338
No. No, no.
We just think a different way.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:48.597
True.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:51.258
You believe our Buddhists are only men.

01:20:51.598 --> 01:20:53.018
Just human beings.

01:20:53.099 --> 01:20:54.769
Even a Buddha dies.

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:57.265
Like all men.

01:20:57.354 --> 01:20:59.444
- He is not the Creator.
- You are ignorant.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:05.447
<i>Padre,</i> only a Christian would see
Buddhists simply as men.

01:21:05.946 --> 01:21:09.406
Our Buddha is a being
which men can become.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:13.871
Something greater than himself
if he can overcome all his illusions.

01:21:13.954 --> 01:21:18.424
But you cling to your illusions
and call them faith.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.710
No, you don't understand.

01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:21.713
If any man follows
God's commandments,

01:21:21.795 --> 01:21:23.795
then he can live a peaceful
and joyous life.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.300
I do. I do understand.

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.223
<i>Padre,</i> it is perfectly simple.

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:34.135
Have you heard that word?

01:21:37.352 --> 01:21:41.232
It means fall down, surrender,

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:43.074
give up the faith.

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:45.319
Apostatize, as you say.

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:46.902
Do it.

01:21:47.362 --> 01:21:51.912
If you don't apostatize,
the prisoners will be hung over the pit.

01:21:51.992 --> 01:21:57.042
Until you do, their lives bleeding away
drop by drop.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:22:00.583
Some last for days, some do not.

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:02.627
They die.

01:22:02.711 --> 01:22:06.171
They tortured
Fathers Porro and Cassola over the pit.

01:22:06.256 --> 01:22:08.086
Have you heard of them?

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:10.434
There was one called Pedro, too.

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:11.680
And Ferreira of course.

01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:13.559
Ferreira?

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:15.353
Did you know him?

01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:19.688
I have... I have heard of him.

01:22:19.769 --> 01:22:23.109
No doubt. He's well-known
all over Japan now.

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:26.859
The priest with the Japanese name
and the Japanese wife.

01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:31.696
- I don't believe you.
- You can ask anyone.

01:22:32.741 --> 01:22:35.951
People in Nagasaki
point him out and marvel.

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:41.455
He's held in great esteem now,

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:44.881
which, I believe, is why
he came here in the first place.

01:23:08.151 --> 01:23:10.741
<i>I thought that martyrdom
would be my salvation.</i>

01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:14.781
<i>Please, please, God,
do not let it be my shame.</i>

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:21.075
<i>The Lord is my refuge,
and my deliverer.</i>

01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:23.674
<i>My God is my helper,
and in Him will I put my trust.</i>

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:26.840
<i>Of the Blood, all price exceeding,
shed by our immortal King,</i>

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.420
<i>destined for the world's redemption.</i>

01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:43.437
Why are you following me?

01:23:46.773 --> 01:23:48.533
Stop following me!

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.520
<i>Thank you, Lord,
for the gentle days here.</i>

01:24:25.854 --> 01:24:28.574
Jesus taught me to love everyone.

01:24:28.648 --> 01:24:33.148
But I cannot feel love to those
who torture our friends to death.

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:36.490
I am angry. I cannot love them.

01:24:36.573 --> 01:24:40.583
<i>Even the guards
have been touched by your hand, Lord.</i>

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.290
I feel guilty.

01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.750
<i>I wonder
if this unbroken peace...</i>

01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:46.921
From Him comes my salvation.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
<i>...is proof that my death is not far away.</i>

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.916
I shall never be shaken.

01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:53.585
I shall never be shaken.

01:24:53.673 --> 01:24:55.343
I shall never be shaken.

01:24:55.425 --> 01:25:00.215
<i>I see the life of your son so clearly,
almost like my own.</i>

01:25:01.431 --> 01:25:05.391
<i>And his face, it takes all fear from me.</i>

01:25:06.519 --> 01:25:09.439
<i>It is the face I remember
from childhood.</i>

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.150
<i>Speaking to me.</i>

01:25:12.692 --> 01:25:14.402
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:17.741
<i>Promising "I will not abandon you."</i>

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.445
<i>"I will not abandon you."</i>

01:25:22.452 --> 01:25:24.292
<i>"I will not abandon you."</i>

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:29.379
Put them on.

01:25:29.459 --> 01:25:33.379
You should be honored.
It's what our priests wear.

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:57.896
Father Rodrigues from Portugal, yes?

01:25:58.446 --> 01:26:01.566
I am sorry, <i>Padre,</i> for my speaking.

01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:04.491
My language is not so good.

01:26:04.577 --> 01:26:08.077
But his Lordship,
the Governor of Chikugo,

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:11.754
is anxious about your
comfort.

01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:14.836
Comfort?

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:17.672
Perhaps discomfort.

01:26:17.757 --> 01:26:20.007
Discomfort. Yes.

01:26:20.426 --> 01:26:24.846
About why you are here,
and if you are not at ease,

01:26:24.931 --> 01:26:26.431
please say so.

01:26:30.812 --> 01:26:32.772
Your trip was long.

01:26:32.856 --> 01:26:34.726
There were many dangers.

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:38.605
The power of your determination
touches us greatly.

01:26:41.114 --> 01:26:43.374
We know
you have also suffered greatly.

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.290
We do not wish to add to your suffering.

01:26:46.953 --> 01:26:51.253
And the thought that
we might do so is painful for us, too.

01:26:53.334 --> 01:26:54.754
Thank you.

01:26:55.086 --> 01:26:56.206
<i>Padre.</i>

01:26:57.672 --> 01:26:59.512
The doctrine
you bring with you

01:26:59.591 --> 01:27:02.511
may be true in Spain and Portugal,

01:27:02.594 --> 01:27:04.604
but we have studied it carefully.

01:27:04.679 --> 01:27:06.719
Thought about it over much time.

01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:14.403
And find it is of no use
and of no value in Japan.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:21.818
We have concluded that it is a danger.

01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:31.001
But we believe
we have brought you the truth.

01:27:33.166 --> 01:27:35.456
The truth is universal.

01:27:35.543 --> 01:27:37.843
It's common to all countries at all times.

01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:40.051
That's why we call it the truth.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.060
If a doctrine weren't as true
here in Japan as it is in Portugal,

01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:50.018
then we couldn't call it the truth.

01:27:57.357 --> 01:28:00.357
I see you do not
work with your hands, Father.

01:28:02.445 --> 01:28:06.365
But everyone knows a tree
which flourishes in one kind of earth

01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:09.119
may decay and die in another.

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:14.956
It is the same
with the tree of Christianity.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:17.211
The leaves decay here.

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:20.507
The buds die.

01:28:20.588 --> 01:28:22.468
It is not the soil that
has killed the buds.

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:27.218
There were 300,000 Christians
here in Japan before the soil was...

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:33.893
Yes?

01:28:35.395 --> 01:28:37.225
Was poisoned.

01:28:46.948 --> 01:28:48.738
You have no reply?

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:52.660
And why should you? You're...

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:55.155
You're never going to change my heart.

01:28:56.749 --> 01:28:59.749
And it seems like
I'm not going to change yours.

01:29:00.253 --> 01:29:03.553
You want to test my faith?
Give me a real challenge.

01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:06.434
Bring me to the Inquisitor.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:09.259
Bring me to Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

01:29:19.939 --> 01:29:21.649
Why are they laughing?

01:29:22.275 --> 01:29:24.275
I didn't say anything funny.
Why are they laughing?

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.610
Because, <i>Padre...</i>

01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:30.278
Because...

01:29:32.452 --> 01:29:35.462
I am the Governor of Chikugo.

01:29:36.456 --> 01:29:39.456
I am the Inquisitor.

01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:44.048
I am Inoue.

01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:33.809
How long... How long will they
have to work like this in the rain?

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:35.518
Until finished.

01:30:53.324 --> 01:30:57.124
<i>Padre. Padre! Padre!</i>

01:30:57.995 --> 01:30:59.245
Please listen to me.

01:31:01.165 --> 01:31:03.495
Please listen to me!

01:31:03.584 --> 01:31:05.924
I never took their money!

01:31:06.045 --> 01:31:08.625
I did not betray you for money!

01:31:53.009 --> 01:31:54.759
Be careful of him, <i>Padre.</i>

01:31:54.844 --> 01:31:58.724
Maybe Inoue-<i>sama</i> pays him
to make us trample.

01:31:58.806 --> 01:32:00.386
No, he did not!

01:32:02.602 --> 01:32:05.652
Please, <i>Padre.</i> Let me confess.

01:32:06.564 --> 01:32:08.074
<i>Padre...</i>

01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:25.831
I know I smell.

01:32:25.917 --> 01:32:27.377
I smell of sin.

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:32.756
I want to confess again
so the Lord can wash me clean.

01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:40.596
Why did you come here?

01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:45.981
Is it for absolution?

01:32:48.564 --> 01:32:51.154
Do you have any understanding
what absolution is?

01:32:51.234 --> 01:32:53.784
Do you understand
what I've been saying?

01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:56.534
Years ago,

01:32:57.198 --> 01:32:59.698
I could have died a good Christian.

01:33:00.243 --> 01:33:02.663
There was no persecution!

01:33:03.663 --> 01:33:05.673
Why was I born now?

01:33:06.499 --> 01:33:08.379
This is so unfair!

01:33:10.169 --> 01:33:11.549
I am sorry.

01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:18.842
But do you still believe?

01:33:42.243 --> 01:33:46.043
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i>
for I have sinned.

01:33:47.373 --> 01:33:51.593
I am sorry for being so weak.

01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:57.473
I am sorry this has happened.

01:34:00.094 --> 01:34:04.314
I am sorry for what I did to you.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.400
Help me, <i>Padre.</i> Take away the sin.

01:34:13.232 --> 01:34:15.742
I will try again to be strong!

01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:23.909
<i>Father, how could
Jesus love a wretch like this?</i>

01:34:25.911 --> 01:34:27.751
<i>There is evil all around in this place.</i>

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:30.460
<i>I sense its strength, even its beauty.</i>

01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:34.587
<i>But there is none of that in this man.</i>

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:38.259
<i>He is not worthy to be called evil.</i>

01:34:47.266 --> 01:34:48.516
Go in peace.

01:34:52.605 --> 01:34:54.105
<i>I feel...</i>

01:34:54.607 --> 01:34:57.857
<i>I... I fear. Jesus, forgive me.</i>

01:34:57.943 --> 01:35:00.573
<i>I may not be worthy of you.</i>

01:36:00.714 --> 01:36:03.304
<i>Ikitsuki-jima, Kuboura, Chokichi.</i>

01:36:32.246 --> 01:36:33.576
<i>Onajiku, Haru.</i>

01:36:54.935 --> 01:36:56.555
<i>Onajiku, Tobe.</i>

01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.340
<i>Onajiku, Wataichi.</i>

01:38:51.594 --> 01:38:54.314
<i>Thank you, Lord,
for hearing my prayer.</i>

01:42:26.099 --> 01:42:31.649
Ah. I'm sorry I've neglected you
for some days now, <i>Padre.</i>

01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:35.441
But I had business in Hirado.

01:42:36.068 --> 01:42:39.908
I hope you get to go there
yourself sometime.

01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:42.911
I'm sure it's very beautiful.

01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:48.411
There is an interesting story
about the <i>daimyo</i> who ruled there.

01:42:48.497 --> 01:42:52.377
He had four concubines. Four!

01:42:53.502 --> 01:42:57.512
They were all beautiful, but they...

01:42:59.132 --> 01:43:01.762
I'm sorry.

01:43:01.844 --> 01:43:05.684
Maybe this is not a story
for a celibate priest.

01:43:06.181 --> 01:43:08.731
It's all right. Please go on.

01:43:08.809 --> 01:43:13.059
In that case, the <i>daimyo's</i>
concubines were all jealous

01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:16.016
and they fought and fought without end.

01:43:16.108 --> 01:43:21.148
So the <i>daimyo</i> of Hirado
drove them away from his castle,

01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:24.658
and peace came into his life again.

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:28.584
Do you think this story has a lesson?

01:43:31.248 --> 01:43:32.248
Yes.

01:43:34.042 --> 01:43:36.632
That this was a very wise man.

01:43:37.004 --> 01:43:38.304
I'm glad.

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.340
That means you understand
the <i>daimyo</i> is like Japan,

01:43:42.718 --> 01:43:46.558
and these concubines are Spain,

01:43:47.222 --> 01:43:51.312
Portugal, Holland, England.

01:43:51.518 --> 01:43:55.228
Each trying to gain the advantage
against the other

01:43:55.314 --> 01:43:57.904
and destroy the house in the process!

01:43:59.568 --> 01:44:02.318
Since you say this man is wise,

01:44:02.404 --> 01:44:06.744
you will understand why
we must outlaw the Christian.

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.950
Well,

01:44:10.495 --> 01:44:13.415
our church teaches monogamy.

01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:16.667
Oh.

01:44:20.088 --> 01:44:22.088
- One wife.
- Uh-huh.

01:44:22.174 --> 01:44:26.644
What if Japan were to choose
one lawful wife from the four?

01:44:29.014 --> 01:44:31.104
You mean Portugal.

01:44:31.183 --> 01:44:32.273
No.

01:44:33.685 --> 01:44:35.645
I mean, the Holy Church.

01:44:41.318 --> 01:44:44.988
Don't you think
it would be better for the man

01:44:45.072 --> 01:44:49.332
to forget about foreign women
and choose one of his own?

01:44:49.409 --> 01:44:53.039
Nationality is not so important
when it comes to a marriage.

01:44:53.121 --> 01:44:55.171
What matters is love.

01:44:55.707 --> 01:44:58.747
Love and fidelity.

01:44:59.544 --> 01:45:00.804
Ah, love.

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:03.915
<i>Padre,</i>

01:45:04.007 --> 01:45:09.547
there are men who are plagued
by the persistent love of an ugly woman.

01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:14.730
Is that what missionary work is to you?

01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:17.194
An ugly woman?

01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:18.650
Well...

01:45:20.524 --> 01:45:22.074
Yes.

01:45:28.824 --> 01:45:30.664
- Barren.
- A barren woman

01:45:30.742 --> 01:45:32.742
cannot be a true wife.

01:45:34.913 --> 01:45:38.833
If the gospel has lost its way here,
it's not the fault of the church.

01:45:39.793 --> 01:45:41.753
It is the fault of those

01:45:42.212 --> 01:45:44.592
who tear away the faithful
from their faith

01:45:44.673 --> 01:45:46.763
like a husband from a wife.

01:45:49.469 --> 01:45:52.219
You mean me?

01:45:54.266 --> 01:45:55.926
<i>Padre,</i>

01:45:56.893 --> 01:46:00.733
you missionaries
do not seem to know Japan.

01:46:01.148 --> 01:46:03.858
And you, Honorable Inquisitor,

01:46:04.317 --> 01:46:06.857
do not seem to know Christianity.

01:46:20.876 --> 01:46:26.376
There are those who think
of your religion as a curse.

01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:28.682
I do not.

01:46:28.967 --> 01:46:31.927
I see it in another way.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:35.310
But still dangerous.

01:46:51.782 --> 01:46:57.542
I'd like you to think about
the persistent love of an ugly woman

01:46:57.621 --> 01:47:01.541
and how a barren woman
should never be a wife.

01:47:11.051 --> 01:47:12.221
Padre!

01:47:12.594 --> 01:47:15.264
<i>Padre!</i> Help me, <i>Padre!</i>

01:47:17.808 --> 01:47:19.478
Help me, please!

01:47:19.893 --> 01:47:21.813
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

01:47:23.021 --> 01:47:24.021
<i>Padre!</i>

01:47:24.106 --> 01:47:26.396
Where are you taking them?

01:47:27.275 --> 01:47:29.485
Where are you taking them?

01:47:30.028 --> 01:47:32.698
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

01:47:32.989 --> 01:47:35.029
<i>Padre!</i>

01:47:39.788 --> 01:47:41.408
You are traveling today.

01:48:26.751 --> 01:48:30.301
Sit down. It's better for you, I think.

01:48:31.089 --> 01:48:32.339
Please.

01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:46.860
<i>Padre.</i>

01:48:47.939 --> 01:48:49.769
How are you feeling today, eh?

01:48:51.776 --> 01:48:54.106
I'm sure the air must feel good

01:48:54.988 --> 01:48:57.528
even though you were
in our newest prison.

01:48:57.616 --> 01:49:00.536
The old prison was very tough
on the <i>padres.</i>

01:49:00.619 --> 01:49:03.659
- Rain, wind...
- Sorry. Excuse me.

01:49:04.748 --> 01:49:06.958
When will Inoue-<i>sama</i> be here?

01:49:07.626 --> 01:49:10.456
Oh. He's not coming today.

01:49:11.463 --> 01:49:12.963
Do you miss him?

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.470
He treats me kindly.

01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:19.140
Three meals a day so that
my body will betray my heart.

01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:21.506
That's your plan, isn't it?

01:49:21.598 --> 01:49:23.058
That's what you're waiting for.

01:49:23.141 --> 01:49:24.601
- Not at all.
- No?

01:49:26.311 --> 01:49:28.981
But we are waiting for someone today.

01:49:29.064 --> 01:49:31.484
Inoue-<i>sama</i> wants you to meet him.

01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:35.149
He will be here any moment.

01:49:36.029 --> 01:49:38.199
He's Portuguese like yourself.

01:49:38.281 --> 01:49:41.201
You should have a lot to talk about, huh?

01:49:42.827 --> 01:49:44.447
Ferreira.

01:49:59.678 --> 01:50:01.508
Is it who you expected?

01:50:05.684 --> 01:50:08.354
Is it who you expected?

01:50:14.526 --> 01:50:17.776
- I want to talk to him.
- There's no hurry.

01:50:18.697 --> 01:50:21.197
It is early. Plenty of time.

01:50:23.618 --> 01:50:26.408
Tell me. Does he know I'm here?

01:50:26.955 --> 01:50:28.325
I cannot tell you.

01:50:28.415 --> 01:50:32.335
I must not speak about the business
of the Inquisitor's office.

01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:34.881
But I can tell you

01:50:35.422 --> 01:50:40.052
he knows you are alive
because we told him you apostatized.

01:50:47.058 --> 01:50:50.268
Now, do you know what
they use those mats for?

01:50:51.396 --> 01:50:52.436
No.

01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:01.071
Look. The guard.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.830
What could he be saying
to Father Garupe?

01:51:06.453 --> 01:51:07.753
Maybe this.

01:51:07.954 --> 01:51:11.714
If you are truly a Christian,
you will apostatize

01:51:12.334 --> 01:51:14.254
and not let them die.

01:51:27.349 --> 01:51:32.229
You know, the Inquisitor promises
that if Father Garupe apostatizes,

01:51:32.312 --> 01:51:34.272
the four will be free.

01:51:34.439 --> 01:51:36.689
I hope Father Garupe agrees.

01:51:40.195 --> 01:51:44.025
I should tell you,
these Christians already trampled

01:51:44.115 --> 01:51:47.195
and denied their faith
at the Inquisitor's office.

01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:49.580
If they did what you wanted,
then let them go.

01:51:49.662 --> 01:51:52.042
Let them go.
They did what you wanted.

01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:53.633
So let them go. Please.

01:51:53.708 --> 01:51:55.998
Please! Please! Please! Let them go!

01:51:56.086 --> 01:51:57.376
We don't want them.

01:51:57.462 --> 01:51:58.882
Four farmers?

01:51:58.963 --> 01:52:00.973
There are still hundreds
of Christian peasants

01:52:01.049 --> 01:52:02.719
on the islands off the coast.

01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:05.681
- No!
- We want the <i>Padre</i> to deny,

01:52:05.762 --> 01:52:07.812
and be an example to them.

01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:14.770
No, please!

01:52:15.146 --> 01:52:17.816
<i>Oh, apostatize! Apostatize!</i>

01:52:17.899 --> 01:52:21.149
<i>For their sake, Lord,
do not leave this to us!</i>

01:52:21.236 --> 01:52:23.236
Take me instead!

01:52:28.243 --> 01:52:29.663
No!

01:52:30.745 --> 01:52:32.035
No!

01:52:33.581 --> 01:52:36.541
No, no, no! Garupe, no!

01:52:39.003 --> 01:52:41.513
No, no, no! No!

01:52:44.676 --> 01:52:46.296
No!

01:53:08.032 --> 01:53:09.032
No!

01:53:10.201 --> 01:53:11.291
No!

01:53:15.623 --> 01:53:16.713
No!

01:53:19.711 --> 01:53:22.091
Oh, please! Please, please!

01:53:59.626 --> 01:54:02.796
Terrible business! Terrible!

01:54:04.297 --> 01:54:07.007
No matter how many times you see it.

01:54:08.593 --> 01:54:12.473
Think about the suffering
you have inflicted on these people

01:54:12.764 --> 01:54:16.434
just because of your selfish dream
of a Christian Japan.

01:54:16.684 --> 01:54:20.314
Your <i>Deus</i> punishes Japan through you!

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.193
At least Garupe was clean.

01:54:24.692 --> 01:54:27.652
But you, you have no will!

01:54:28.321 --> 01:54:31.701
You do not deserve to be called a priest.

01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:10.610
My God. My God.
Why have you forsaken me?

01:55:10.655 --> 01:55:11.815
Why have you forsaken me?

01:55:14.158 --> 01:55:15.788
I was your son.

01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:21.250
Your son was going to the cross.

01:55:24.752 --> 01:55:26.632
You were silent, even to him.

01:55:27.755 --> 01:55:31.085
<i>Your silent, cold son.</i>

01:55:33.386 --> 01:55:34.756
Oh, no, no.

01:55:37.765 --> 01:55:39.765
<i>Ludicrous. Ludicrous.</i>

01:55:42.061 --> 01:55:43.441
Stupid.

01:55:44.272 --> 01:55:45.612
Stupid.

01:55:50.528 --> 01:55:52.528
He's not going to answer.

01:55:58.036 --> 01:56:00.036
He's not going to answer.

01:56:33.529 --> 01:56:35.069
<i>Padre.</i>

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:37.330
<i>Padre.</i>

01:57:13.277 --> 01:57:14.987
Come along, <i>Padre.</i>

01:57:26.708 --> 01:57:29.288
Our priests
do not like your priests,

01:57:29.377 --> 01:57:32.337
but you will still find much of value here.

01:57:56.946 --> 01:57:58.656
What is it, <i>Padre?</i>

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.830
The incense?

01:58:04.912 --> 01:58:06.582
The smell of meat?

01:58:09.625 --> 01:58:12.085
Have you had any meat
since you came to Japan?

01:58:12.170 --> 01:58:14.590
I don't much like the smell, myself.

01:58:21.929 --> 01:58:23.259
Have you guessed yet?

01:58:25.183 --> 01:58:27.393
Have you guessed who's coming?

01:58:30.688 --> 01:58:32.898
This is Inoue-<i>sama's</i> command

01:58:33.441 --> 01:58:36.531
and the other's wish.

01:58:41.449 --> 01:58:42.869
The other?

01:58:51.292 --> 01:58:54.052
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

01:58:54.128 --> 01:58:55.758
thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

01:58:55.838 --> 01:59:00.678
<i>Padre,</i> think of
the souls you can save,

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.350
<i>Padre</i> Ferreira.

02:00:10.538 --> 02:00:11.788
Fa...

02:00:14.625 --> 02:00:16.205
Father...

02:00:23.718 --> 02:00:26.638
Father Ferreira.

02:00:28.723 --> 02:00:30.433
I'd given up.

02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:36.559
So long since we have met.

02:00:40.318 --> 02:00:42.108
Please say something.

02:00:44.488 --> 02:00:45.868
What

02:00:47.033 --> 02:00:50.123
can I say to you on such an occasion?

02:00:54.999 --> 02:00:58.169
If you have any pity for me,
say something.

02:01:08.387 --> 02:01:10.057
Have you... Have you...

02:01:10.139 --> 02:01:12.639
Have you been living here for long?

02:01:14.226 --> 02:01:16.686
About a year, I suppose.

02:01:24.195 --> 02:01:26.065
Why? What is this place?

02:01:26.155 --> 02:01:29.445
A temple where I study.

02:01:33.204 --> 02:01:35.584
I'm in... I'm in a sort of prison

02:01:35.665 --> 02:01:39.835
somewhere in Nagasaki.
I don't know precisely where.

02:01:39.919 --> 02:01:41.339
I know it.

02:01:45.841 --> 02:01:47.221
You were my teacher.

02:01:50.471 --> 02:01:52.521
You were my confessor.

02:01:52.807 --> 02:01:55.387
- My teacher.
- I'm much the same.

02:02:05.778 --> 02:02:08.658
Do a single simple thing.

02:02:08.906 --> 02:02:10.826
Tell me then, <i>Padre.</i>

02:02:11.492 --> 02:02:14.452
Tell me you agree.

02:02:27.341 --> 02:02:28.721
Do I...

02:02:30.469 --> 02:02:33.099
Do I really seem so different?

02:02:38.644 --> 02:02:42.444
The Honorable Sawano
spends his day writing

02:02:42.523 --> 02:02:44.283
about astronomy.

02:02:45.568 --> 02:02:47.528
At Inoue-<i>sama's</i> order.

02:02:47.611 --> 02:02:51.121
There is great knowledge here.

02:02:51.824 --> 02:02:54.994
But in, uh, medicine and astronomy,
much remains to be taught.

02:02:56.037 --> 02:02:57.867
I'm happy to help.

02:02:58.748 --> 02:03:03.958
It is fulfilling to finally
be of use in this country.

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.550
Then you're happy, Father?

02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:15.431
I said so.

02:03:21.771 --> 02:03:23.731
Mention the other book you are writing.

02:03:27.401 --> 02:03:29.361
It is called <i>Kengiroku.</i>

02:03:29.445 --> 02:03:31.775
It shows the errors of Christianity

02:03:32.323 --> 02:03:35.083
and refutes the teachings of <i>Deus.</i>

02:03:35.534 --> 02:03:37.664
Do you understand the title?

02:03:38.788 --> 02:03:40.038
Tell him.

02:03:43.584 --> 02:03:45.924
It means

02:03:46.045 --> 02:03:51.175
deceit disclosed, or unmasked,
if you prefer a more florid reading.

02:03:53.719 --> 02:03:57.769
His Lordship, the Inquisitor,
he praises it.

02:03:57.848 --> 02:04:00.058
He says it is well done.

02:04:02.895 --> 02:04:03.895
It's the truth.

02:04:03.979 --> 02:04:06.319
You use the truth like poison!

02:04:06.398 --> 02:04:08.228
What a funny thing for a priest to say.

02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:10.987
This is cruel. Cruel.

02:04:11.862 --> 02:04:15.702
Worse than any torture
to twist a man's soul in this way.

02:04:16.367 --> 02:04:18.737
I think you must be speaking of yourself.

02:04:18.828 --> 02:04:20.578
Not of Sawano Chūan.

02:04:20.663 --> 02:04:22.333
- Who?
- Him!

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.670
He is Ferreira only to you.

02:04:26.168 --> 02:04:28.798
He is Sawano Chūan now.

02:04:29.547 --> 02:04:31.797
A man who has found peace.

02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:34.471
Let him guide you along his path.

02:04:34.552 --> 02:04:36.302
The path of mercy.

02:04:36.387 --> 02:04:38.717
That means only that you abandon self.

02:04:38.806 --> 02:04:42.056
No one should interfere
with another man's spirit.

02:04:42.143 --> 02:04:46.903
To help others is the way of the Buddha
and your way, too.

02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:49.571
The two religions are the same in this.

02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:51.900
It is not necessary to win anyone over

02:04:51.986 --> 02:04:55.486
to one side or another
when there is so much to share.

02:04:56.532 --> 02:04:57.912
Go on.

02:05:01.412 --> 02:05:05.042
I've been told to get you
to abandon the faith.

02:05:08.252 --> 02:05:09.552
This...

02:05:12.006 --> 02:05:13.716
This is from the pit.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.770
You're tied so you can't move
and hung upside down.

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.350
<i>An incision is made.</i>

02:05:31.317 --> 02:05:35.357
<i>You feel the blood
dripping down, drop by drop,</i>

02:05:36.614 --> 02:05:40.584
so it doesn't run to your head
and you won't die too soon.

02:05:53.255 --> 02:05:55.295
Step on your Jesus.

02:06:40.386 --> 02:06:43.256
You are the last priest
left here now, <i>Padre.</i>

02:06:43.347 --> 02:06:47.727
I'm sure Inoue-<i>sama</i> will be pleased
to put an end to the pain.

02:06:48.352 --> 02:06:50.352
He's a practical man, <i>Padre.</i>

02:06:50.688 --> 02:06:52.358
Not a cruel one.

02:06:53.065 --> 02:06:56.275
I have labored in this country
for 15 years.

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.400
I know it better than you.

02:06:59.029 --> 02:07:02.699
Our religion does not
take root in this country.

02:07:03.033 --> 02:07:05.743
Because the roots have been torn up.

02:07:05.828 --> 02:07:08.708
No! Because this country is a swamp.

02:07:08.789 --> 02:07:10.289
Nothing grows here.

02:07:10.374 --> 02:07:12.464
Plant a sapling here and the roots rot.

02:07:12.543 --> 02:07:15.463
There was a time when Christianity
grew and flourished here.

02:07:15.546 --> 02:07:16.546
- When?
- When?

02:07:17.006 --> 02:07:19.716
In your time, Father.

02:07:21.176 --> 02:07:23.846
In your time, before you became like...

02:07:23.929 --> 02:07:25.759
Like who? Like them?

02:07:25.848 --> 02:07:27.268
Rodrigues, please listen.

02:07:27.725 --> 02:07:31.435
The Japanese only believe
in their distortion of our gospel.

02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:33.110
So they did not believe at all.

02:07:33.188 --> 02:07:34.688
They never believed.

02:07:34.773 --> 02:07:35.863
How can you say that?

02:07:35.941 --> 02:07:38.651
From the time of St. Francis Xavier
through your own time.

02:07:38.736 --> 02:07:40.816
There were hundreds
of thousands of converts here.

02:07:40.904 --> 02:07:42.914
- Converts?
- Converts, yes!

02:07:43.615 --> 02:07:44.985
Francis Xavier came here

02:07:45.075 --> 02:07:46.945
to teach the Japanese
about the Son of God.

02:07:47.036 --> 02:07:50.706
But first he had to ask
how to refer to God.

02:07:50.789 --> 02:07:53.329
<i>"Dainichi,"</i> he was told.

02:07:53.959 --> 02:07:56.629
And shall I show you their <i>Dainichi?</i>

02:07:57.129 --> 02:08:01.929
Behold. There is the Son of God.

02:08:02.426 --> 02:08:04.716
God's only begotten Son.

02:08:06.138 --> 02:08:08.928
In the scriptures,
Jesus rose on the third day.

02:08:09.016 --> 02:08:10.266
In Japan,

02:08:11.018 --> 02:08:13.848
...the Son of God rises daily.

02:08:14.355 --> 02:08:16.645
The Japanese cannot think
of an existence

02:08:16.732 --> 02:08:18.192
beyond the realm of nature.

02:08:18.275 --> 02:08:20.855
For them, nothing transcends a human.

02:08:20.944 --> 02:08:22.914
- No.
- They can't conceive

02:08:22.988 --> 02:08:24.618
of our idea of the Christian God.

02:08:24.698 --> 02:08:26.528
No, you're wrong. You're wrong.

02:08:26.617 --> 02:08:29.747
They worship God. God! Our Lord.

02:08:30.412 --> 02:08:32.332
They praise the name of <i>Deus.</i>

02:08:32.414 --> 02:08:35.544
That's just another word
for a god they never knew.

02:08:36.168 --> 02:08:37.668
I saw men die!

02:08:37.753 --> 02:08:39.053
I did, too.

02:08:39.129 --> 02:08:42.339
For <i>Deus!</i> On fire with their faith!

02:08:42.674 --> 02:08:44.844
Your martyrs may have been
on fire, Father,

02:08:44.927 --> 02:08:46.927
but it was not for the Christian faith.

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.310
I saw them die. I saw them die.

02:08:50.391 --> 02:08:52.351
They did not die for nothing.

02:08:52.851 --> 02:08:54.061
They did not.

02:08:55.771 --> 02:08:58.321
They're dying for you, Rodrigues.

02:09:02.903 --> 02:09:04.663
How many did you save

02:09:04.738 --> 02:09:07.198
when you trampled
on the face of our Lord?

02:09:07.282 --> 02:09:08.742
How many beside yourself?

02:09:08.826 --> 02:09:10.286
I don't know.

02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:14.081
Certainly not as many as you may help.

02:09:14.164 --> 02:09:17.004
You're trying to justify
your own weakness.

02:09:18.085 --> 02:09:19.915
God have mercy on you.

02:09:20.003 --> 02:09:22.173
Which god? Which one?

02:09:22.256 --> 02:09:24.426
We say...

02:09:26.343 --> 02:09:27.433
I'm sorry.

02:09:27.511 --> 02:09:29.811
You haven't learned
the language thoroughly, have you?

02:09:29.888 --> 02:09:31.768
There's a saying here.

02:09:32.141 --> 02:09:36.811
Mountains and rivers can be moved,
but man's nature cannot be moved.

02:09:37.604 --> 02:09:40.324
It's very wise, like so much here.

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:46.200
We find our original nature
in Japan, Rodrigues.

02:09:47.156 --> 02:09:50.116
Perhaps it's what's meant
by finding God.

02:09:52.161 --> 02:09:53.831
You're a disgrace.

02:09:58.834 --> 02:10:00.884
You're a disgrace, Father.

02:10:01.462 --> 02:10:04.012
I can't...

02:10:04.089 --> 02:10:06.879
I can't even call you that anymore.

02:10:09.136 --> 02:10:12.636
Good. I have a Japanese name now,

02:10:13.307 --> 02:10:16.057
and a wife, and children.

02:10:19.229 --> 02:10:21.979
I inherited them all
from an executed man.

02:10:37.873 --> 02:10:39.503
How do you feel?

02:10:39.583 --> 02:10:42.253
He has shown you the path of mercy.

02:10:42.336 --> 02:10:44.086
I hope you take it.

02:10:46.298 --> 02:10:49.059
Why don't you just hang me in the pit?

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:25.340
<i>Padre,</i> you came here
for them and they all hate you.

02:11:25.921 --> 02:11:29.051
Insult me all you like.
You just give me more courage.

02:11:29.675 --> 02:11:31.956
You will need it tonight.

02:11:32.678 --> 02:11:34.638
You are a good man, <i>Padre.</i>

02:11:34.721 --> 02:11:36.351
You cannot stand suffering.

02:11:36.431 --> 02:11:38.431
Your own or others'.

02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:46.150
Inoue-<i>sama</i> says
you will apostatize tonight.

02:11:47.818 --> 02:11:49.948
He was right about Ferreira.

02:11:51.113 --> 02:11:52.993
And he's right about you.

02:11:57.327 --> 02:12:00.287
God help me. Jesus help me.

02:12:07.296 --> 02:12:09.256
In the garden, You said,

02:12:09.339 --> 02:12:13.549
"Thy soul is sorrowful even unto death."

02:12:14.094 --> 02:12:16.144
I would bleed for you.

02:12:16.221 --> 02:12:17.601
I would.

02:12:18.473 --> 02:12:21.233
I would die for you if I knew you...

02:12:23.312 --> 02:12:25.112
Are you here with me?

02:12:42.914 --> 02:12:45.794
<i>Padre.</i> Forgive me.

02:12:47.961 --> 02:12:51.421
<i>Padre!</i> I came here to make confession.

02:12:52.549 --> 02:12:54.109
<i>Padre!</i>

02:12:55.385 --> 02:12:57.095
Forgive me, <i>Padre!</i>

02:12:57.679 --> 02:12:59.179
Forgive me!

02:13:07.856 --> 02:13:11.356
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop the noise!

02:13:11.943 --> 02:13:13.993
Stop it! Someone help him!

02:13:15.489 --> 02:13:18.279
- What do you need?
- Not me. Down there.

02:13:18.575 --> 02:13:20.325
There is a man in agony

02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:23.660
and the guard is sound asleep
and snoring like a wild dog!

02:13:24.915 --> 02:13:27.325
You think that noise is the guard?

02:13:28.001 --> 02:13:29.131
Incredible.

02:13:29.211 --> 02:13:31.761
Sawano, tell him. Say what it is.

02:13:32.756 --> 02:13:36.006
It is not the guard and it's not snoring.

02:13:38.178 --> 02:13:40.718
It's Christians. Five of them, in fact.

02:13:40.931 --> 02:13:42.851
All hanging in the pit.

02:13:48.397 --> 02:13:50.977
Have you found the words on the wall?

02:13:51.775 --> 02:13:53.525
<i>"Laudate eum."</i>

02:13:54.736 --> 02:13:56.776
"Praise Him."

02:13:58.156 --> 02:14:01.276
I cut them there with a stone
when I was in this cell.

02:14:01.368 --> 02:14:02.788
Like you.

02:14:07.249 --> 02:14:08.379
Be quiet.

02:14:08.458 --> 02:14:10.208
Don't... Don't speak to me.

02:14:10.293 --> 02:14:11.673
You have no right to speak to me.

02:14:11.753 --> 02:14:14.513
Oh, I do. Because you are just like me.

02:14:14.923 --> 02:14:16.513
You see Jesus in Gethsemane

02:14:16.591 --> 02:14:19.301
and believe your trial
is the same as His.

02:14:19.386 --> 02:14:22.056
Those five in the pit are suffering, too,
just like Jesus,

02:14:22.139 --> 02:14:23.559
but they don't have your pride.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.480
They would never
compare themselves to Jesus.

02:14:26.727 --> 02:14:29.687
Do you have the right
to make them suffer?

02:14:30.897 --> 02:14:33.567
I heard the cries of suffering
in this same cell.

02:14:33.650 --> 02:14:34.860
And I acted.

02:14:34.943 --> 02:14:36.421
You excuse yourself!
You excuse yourself!

02:14:36.445 --> 02:14:38.905
That is the spirit of darkness.

02:14:39.322 --> 02:14:42.242
And what would you do for them? Pray?

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:46.370
And get what in return?
Only more suffering.

02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:49.920
A suffering only you can end. Not God!

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.380
Go away from me.

02:14:53.086 --> 02:14:55.166
I prayed, too, Rodrigues.

02:14:56.506 --> 02:14:58.176
It doesn't help.

02:14:59.468 --> 02:15:01.848
Go on. Pray.

02:15:08.477 --> 02:15:10.437
But pray with your eyes open.

02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:13.819
No!

02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:30.120
You can spare them.

02:15:31.082 --> 02:15:33.792
They call out for help
just as you call to God.

02:15:33.877 --> 02:15:36.167
He is silent, but you do not have to be.

02:15:36.254 --> 02:15:39.014
They should apostatize. Apostatize!

02:15:39.466 --> 02:15:42.296
God help me. Apostatize!
Korobu! Korobu!

02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:45.310
But they have apostatized.

02:15:45.388 --> 02:15:46.558
Many times over.

02:15:47.432 --> 02:15:49.482
They're here for you, Rodrigues.

02:15:49.559 --> 02:15:52.309
As long as you don't apostatize,
they cannot be saved.

02:15:52.771 --> 02:15:55.401
A priest should act in imitation of Christ.

02:15:56.066 --> 02:15:57.936
If Christ were here...

02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:02.320
If Christ were here, He would've acted.

02:16:02.405 --> 02:16:04.615
Apostatized for their sake.

02:16:05.116 --> 02:16:07.406
No. No, He's here.

02:16:07.494 --> 02:16:09.834
Christ is here. I just can't hear Him.

02:16:10.163 --> 02:16:11.673
Show God you love Him!

02:16:11.748 --> 02:16:13.708
Save the lives of the people He loves.

02:16:16.419 --> 02:16:19.169
There is something more important

02:16:19.256 --> 02:16:21.296
than the judgment of the Church.

02:16:23.969 --> 02:16:27.179
You are now going to fulfill
the most painful act of love

02:16:27.264 --> 02:16:29.434
that has ever been performed.

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.040
It's only a formality.

02:16:52.205 --> 02:16:54.115
Just a formality.

02:17:26.823 --> 02:17:28.583
<i>Come ahead, now.</i>

02:17:30.243 --> 02:17:31.913
<i>It's all right.</i>

02:17:33.495 --> 02:17:34.915
<i>Step on Me.</i>

02:17:39.044 --> 02:17:41.174
<i>I understand your pain.</i>

02:17:44.799 --> 02:17:48.509
<i>I was born into this world
to share men's pain.</i>

02:17:50.513 --> 02:17:53.393
<i>I carried this cross for your pain.</i>

02:17:58.772 --> 02:18:00.772
<i>Your life is with Me now.</i>

02:18:04.653 --> 02:18:06.032
<i>Step.</i>

02:19:38.204 --> 02:19:41.794
<i>It was in the year 1641,</i>

02:19:42.083 --> 02:19:44.963
<i>during the first of my voyages to Japan,</i>

02:19:45.335 --> 02:19:47.876
<i>that I, Dieter Albrecht,</i>

02:19:47.964 --> 02:19:50.184
<i>came upon the most extraordinary story</i>

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:52.470
<i>in these pages.</i>

02:19:54.054 --> 02:19:55.144
Christian.

02:19:55.889 --> 02:19:57.059
Non-Christian.

02:19:57.307 --> 02:20:00.977
<i>As a physician
in a great Dutch trading company,</i>

02:20:01.352 --> 02:20:03.192
<i>I traveled widely.</i>

02:20:03.772 --> 02:20:04.942
Christian.

02:20:05.398 --> 02:20:08.488
<i>But none of the wonders
I have recounted in this journal</i>

02:20:08.818 --> 02:20:10.898
<i>has been so commented on</i>

02:20:11.905 --> 02:20:13.405
<i>as the curious matter...</i>

02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:14.740
Non-Christian.

02:20:14.949 --> 02:20:16.909
<i>...of the apostate priests.</i>

02:20:17.786 --> 02:20:19.036
Christian.

02:20:20.246 --> 02:20:24.206
<i>I came closer than any
European chronicler</i>

02:20:24.292 --> 02:20:26.212
<i>to the enigma of this country.</i>

02:20:26.294 --> 02:20:27.304
Non-Christian.

02:20:28.421 --> 02:20:32.261
<i>And to learning of the lives
of the lost priests.</i>

02:20:34.803 --> 02:20:38.103
<i>Inoue, the Inquisitor, would raid homes</i>

02:20:38.181 --> 02:20:42.351
<i>and search for any objects
with hidden Christian images.</i>

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.850
Christian.

02:20:47.232 --> 02:20:48.982
<i>The two priests were required</i>

02:20:49.067 --> 02:20:52.697
<i>to examine these things
and verify their use.</i>

02:20:54.614 --> 02:20:58.244
<i>I even, on occasion,
observed them myself.</i>

02:21:01.663 --> 02:21:05.633
<i>The Dutch were the only Europeans
allowed to trade in Japan.</i>

02:21:06.376 --> 02:21:07.746
<i>All ships were searched</i>

02:21:07.836 --> 02:21:11.416
<i>to warrant they were not
smuggling religious objects.</i>

02:21:12.215 --> 02:21:15.755
<i>Nothing bearing the images
of the cross, a saint,</i>

02:21:16.136 --> 02:21:17.966
<i>or rosary could pass.</i>

02:21:33.236 --> 02:21:35.106
<i>Despite every attempt,</i>

02:21:35.196 --> 02:21:37.906
<i>a few things
inevitably were smuggled in.</i>

02:21:38.741 --> 02:21:39.781
Christian.

02:21:44.956 --> 02:21:48.036
<i>And then it was
as distressing to the Japanese</i>

02:21:48.126 --> 02:21:50.456
<i>as if blood had been spilled.</i>

02:22:01.764 --> 02:22:05.564
We were taught to love
those who scorned us.

02:22:06.853 --> 02:22:08.403
I feel nothing for them.

02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:12.279
Only our Lord can judge your heart.

02:22:15.612 --> 02:22:17.282
You said, "Our Lord."

02:22:24.662 --> 02:22:25.912
I doubt it.

02:22:32.587 --> 02:22:35.167
<i>When Sawano Chūan died,</i>

02:22:35.256 --> 02:22:40.676
<i>the other priest assumed his duties
and performed them with distinction.</i>

02:22:44.224 --> 02:22:49.104
<i>By this time, I observed he had acquired
considerable skill with the language.</i>

02:22:50.730 --> 02:22:54.400
<i>And seemed to be at peace
with his situation.</i>

02:22:56.361 --> 02:22:58.151
I have good news.

02:22:58.655 --> 02:23:00.865
A man has died in Edo.

02:23:01.991 --> 02:23:03.621
Okada San'emon.

02:23:04.494 --> 02:23:07.874
You will take his name just as it is.

02:23:08.998 --> 02:23:13.378
He had a household,
and a wife and son.

02:23:14.170 --> 02:23:16.420
You can take her as your wife.

02:23:17.924 --> 02:23:21.094
A man works best when he's not alone.

02:23:23.471 --> 02:23:26.101
You should know that on the islands of

02:23:26.182 --> 02:23:30.232
Ikitsuki and Gotō...
Uh... No.

02:23:32.063 --> 02:23:36.233
There are still many farmers
who think themselves Christian.

02:23:36.776 --> 02:23:40.146
Do you like that?
They can continue to be Christian.

02:23:41.239 --> 02:23:43.949
You may take some satisfaction in that,

02:23:44.492 --> 02:23:47.162
because the roots are cut.

02:23:50.206 --> 02:23:52.206
Nothing grows in a swamp.

02:23:54.794 --> 02:23:58.014
Yes, Japan is that kind of country.

02:23:58.548 --> 02:24:01.258
The religion of the Christian
you brought us

02:24:01.342 --> 02:24:03.642
has become a strange thing.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.220
It's changed.

02:24:21.446 --> 02:24:23.866
You were not defeated by me.

02:24:24.449 --> 02:24:28.079
You were defeated
by this swamp of Japan.

02:24:32.165 --> 02:24:33.455
Welcome.

02:24:36.502 --> 02:24:42.092
<i>Okada San'emon lived in Edo
for the remaining years of his life.</i>

02:24:42.842 --> 02:24:45.762
<i>Some 10 years later,
I was allowed to visit Edo.</i>

02:24:47.263 --> 02:24:50.683
<i>The Japanese gossiped freely
about Okada San'emon.</i>

02:24:51.893 --> 02:24:53.313
<i>The Inquisitor Inoue,</i>

02:24:53.394 --> 02:24:56.274
<i>demanded repeated vows
of apostasy from him.</i>

02:24:57.023 --> 02:24:58.573
<i>And they say,</i>

02:24:58.649 --> 02:25:01.689
<i>"The fallen priest
supplied them all quickly</i>

02:25:01.778 --> 02:25:03.398
<i>"and vigorously."</i>

02:25:19.295 --> 02:25:22.335
I heard the Inquisitor
sent his men for you.

02:25:23.466 --> 02:25:25.426
- Was there trouble?
- No.

02:25:26.719 --> 02:25:28.259
No, no. Just...

02:25:28.346 --> 02:25:31.056
He only wanted to make sure
I wrote the "korobi-shoumon."

02:25:32.475 --> 02:25:35.845
My latest oath of renunciation.

02:25:45.321 --> 02:25:46.661
Thank you.

02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:59.500
For being here with me.

02:26:11.472 --> 02:26:12.602
<i>Padre...</i>

02:26:14.225 --> 02:26:15.555
No. No.

02:26:16.727 --> 02:26:20.187
I'm not... I'm not anymore.

02:26:22.358 --> 02:26:23.778
I'm a fallen priest.

02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:26.280
But you are the last priest left.

02:26:28.322 --> 02:26:30.532
You could still hear my confession.

02:26:30.825 --> 02:26:32.285
No, I can't.

02:26:33.035 --> 02:26:34.445
No! I can't!

02:26:36.372 --> 02:26:38.372
I still suffer for what I did, <i>Padre.</i>

02:26:40.543 --> 02:26:44.263
I betrayed you. I betrayed my family.

02:26:45.214 --> 02:26:47.014
I betrayed our Lord.

02:26:48.843 --> 02:26:50.263
Please...

02:26:51.387 --> 02:26:52.887
Hear my confession.

02:26:57.059 --> 02:26:58.229
<i>Padre.</i>

02:27:17.079 --> 02:27:21.079
<i>Lord, I fought against your silence.</i>

02:27:26.797 --> 02:27:28.877
<i>I suffered beside you.</i>

02:27:29.467 --> 02:27:31.217
<i>I was never silent.</i>

02:27:36.933 --> 02:27:38.393
I know.

02:27:45.107 --> 02:27:50.197
But even if God had been
silent my whole life,

02:27:53.616 --> 02:27:55.196
to this very day,

02:27:57.954 --> 02:28:00.504
everything I do, everything I've done...

02:28:06.796 --> 02:28:08.336
Speaks of Him.

02:28:11.634 --> 02:28:14.684
It was in the silence
that I heard Your voice.

02:28:33.489 --> 02:28:36.239
<i>The Inquisitor
continued to insist</i>

02:28:36.325 --> 02:28:40.865
<i>on periodic examinations
of all suspected Christians.</i>

02:28:42.665 --> 02:28:45.745
<i>Okada San'emon
was not exempt from this.</i>

02:28:46.544 --> 02:28:51.174
<i>Inoue was determined
to never let his example be forgotten.</i>

02:28:51.674 --> 02:28:55.684
<i>Perhaps most particularly
by the priest himself.</i>

02:29:03.853 --> 02:29:05.353
Okada San'emon.

02:29:32.965 --> 02:29:36.295
<i>In the year 1667,</i>

02:29:36.802 --> 02:29:40.392
<i>a religious image was
discovered inside an amulet</i>

02:29:40.473 --> 02:29:43.733
<i>belonging to a servant called Kichijiro.</i>

02:29:49.982 --> 02:29:53.032
<i>The servant said
he had won it gambling,</i>

02:29:53.152 --> 02:29:54.822
<i>had never looked inside,</i>

02:29:55.029 --> 02:29:58.699
<i>and could never have gotten
the amulet from Okada San'emon</i>

02:29:58.783 --> 02:30:01.123
<i>since he was always underguard.</i>

02:30:07.416 --> 02:30:11.126
<i>The servant Kichijiro was taken away.</i>

02:30:13.214 --> 02:30:17.934
<i>After that, Okada San'emon
himself was carefully watched.</i>

02:30:18.803 --> 02:30:23.313
<i>During my last voyage in 1682,
I asked about him.</i>

02:30:23.808 --> 02:30:26.438
<i>And the Japanese were eager to reply.</i>

02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:29.480
<i>The last priest</i>

02:30:29.563 --> 02:30:32.153
<i>never acknowledged the Christian God.</i>

02:30:32.650 --> 02:30:34.860
<i>Not by word or symbol.</i>

02:30:36.112 --> 02:30:39.452
<i>He never spoke of Him
and never prayed.</i>

02:30:40.032 --> 02:30:41.952
<i>Not even when he died.</i>

02:30:43.536 --> 02:30:47.206
<i>The business of his faith
was long ended.</i>

02:30:53.796 --> 02:30:56.506
<i>Three guards
stood watch over the coffin</i>

02:30:57.508 --> 02:31:00.848
<i>until it could be taken away,
just to be certain.</i>

02:31:03.055 --> 02:31:06.305
<i>Only his wife was briefly
allowed to view the body,</i>

02:31:06.684 --> 02:31:09.524
<i>and place there,
a humble</i> mamorigatana

02:31:11.564 --> 02:31:13.614
<i>to ward off evil spirits.</i>

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.780
<i>There was no indication that she wept.</i>

02:32:49.703 --> 02:32:53.003
<i>The body was treated
in the Buddhist manner.</i>

02:32:53.958 --> 02:32:57.088
<i>And he was given a posthumous
Buddhist name.</i>

02:33:08.013 --> 02:33:10.523
<i>The man who was once Rodrigues</i>

02:33:11.934 --> 02:33:13.734
<i>ended as they wanted.</i>

02:33:15.604 --> 02:33:17.574
<i>And as I first saw him,</i>

02:33:19.483 --> 02:33:21.033
<i>lost to God.</i>

02:33:27.449 --> 02:33:30.239
<i>But as to that, indeed,</i>

02:33:31.954 --> 02:33:33.794
<i>only God can answer.</i>
