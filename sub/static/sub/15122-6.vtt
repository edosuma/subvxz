WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:07.275
* Whoo *

00:07.341 --> 00:10.211
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh *

00:10.278 --> 00:13.547
* Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

00:13.614 --> 00:16.084
* Birth control, no, no, no *

00:16.150 --> 00:19.553
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh *

00:19.620 --> 00:22.523
* Oh *

00:22.590 --> 00:25.693
* Oh... *

00:25.759 --> 00:31.099
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

00:34.168 --> 00:35.603
What's with all the boxes?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.771
Some guys from the prison
left these for Hope.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.540
It's stuff that
was in Lucy's cell

00:39.607 --> 00:41.309
before they
had to put her down.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.643
Can we start saying
"execute" again?

00:42.710 --> 00:45.279
I thought "put her down"
would sound nicer for the baby,

00:45.346 --> 00:47.381
but it's still feeling like
she died at the pound.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.416
I thought "barbecued her"

00:48.482 --> 00:49.950
was a smart way
to lighten it up,

00:50.017 --> 00:51.319
but no one
wanted to try that.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.453
Hmm.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.588
Hope, your mommy's
not here

00:54.655 --> 00:56.857
'cause the governor
had her barbecued.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.859
Ah, it's close.

00:58.926 --> 00:59.860
There's pros and cons.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.162
It's a tough nut to crack.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.497
Whoo, how badass is this?

01:03.564 --> 01:07.135
A zip gun made out of tampon,
cardboard and rubber bands. Pow.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.471
Hey, all of this
belongs to Hope.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.973
Does anyone know how long
it's gonna be

01:13.040 --> 01:14.608
before we get to Havana?

01:14.675 --> 01:16.877
I'm starting to get
a little seasick.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.312
Look, Maw Maw,
bubble wrap.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.414
Ooh. (popping) Oh!

01:20.481 --> 01:21.682
Whoa, check out these videos.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.520
"To my baby girl,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.989
"watch these tapes so you'll
always know your mommy

01:29.056 --> 01:32.760
in case they send me off
to the electric bye-bye chair."

01:32.826 --> 01:34.595
BOTH:
"The electric bye-bye chair."

01:34.662 --> 01:36.330
Close.
I don't know.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.698
Not a fan.
It's a tough nut to crack.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.272
My beautiful beloved daughter,
if you're watching this,

01:44.338 --> 01:46.240
it's because I'm no longer
with you.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.741
But I doubt they'll pull
the switch

01:47.808 --> 01:49.777
since they'll never find
where I put all the bodies.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.180
FYI, don't dig too deep
in the sandbox

01:52.246 --> 01:54.248
at Paulson's Park.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.817
But if I am taken from you,
I wanted you

01:56.884 --> 01:58.686
to have a few nuggets
of my wisdom.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.922
Do you not see
that I'm making a movie

02:01.989 --> 02:03.191
for my unborn fetus here?!

02:03.257 --> 02:04.992
Shut up!

02:05.058 --> 02:06.894
(women grunting, screaming)

02:08.696 --> 02:10.130
(water sloshing)

02:11.399 --> 02:13.701
That's wisdom
nugget number one:

02:13.767 --> 02:15.803
"Always be considerate
of others."

02:15.869 --> 02:18.239
I want you to understand
the importance of books.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.574
In here, a book
saved my life.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.178
I used this to stab Tanya.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.347
Tanya tried to take my oatmeal.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.650
Oatmeal is so good for you.

02:29.717 --> 02:33.321
The best way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.890
So push your blade in and up
for a definite kill.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.761
I've seen enough.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.062
I still can't believe
you hit something

02:42.129 --> 02:43.564
that hot, Jimmy.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.366
We need to burn these
and not just anywhere.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.501
I think we should burn them
in a church.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.270
Hey. We can't
destroy those.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.138
That's all Hope
has left of her mother.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.374
I'm not so sure
that's true.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.245
Nah. Jelly beans.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.879
Jimmy,
sometimes you have

02:58.946 --> 03:00.180
to protect
your child

03:00.248 --> 03:01.482
from the truth.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.983
I'm not lying to Hope.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.852
Well, you're a parent now.
You have to lie.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.320
It's part of the job.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.322
Wait, did you guys
lie to me?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.557
She did. Not me.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.124
I do not practice "deceitery."

03:11.191 --> 03:12.893
What about,
"I know what I'm doing.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.127
You won't get pregnant"?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.729
I believed it at the time.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.865
What did you lie
to me about, Mom?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.433
It doesn't matter.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.236
They were...
dumb little nothings.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.305
Like when Rexie died,

03:24.372 --> 03:25.639
he didn't really
go to a farm

03:25.706 --> 03:28.542
to hunt rabbits with
Stone Cold Steve Austin's dogs.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.411
And the reason you
shouldn't pick your butt

03:30.478 --> 03:33.180
is not because
there's an eel living in there

03:33.247 --> 03:34.548
and he might
bite your finger off.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.850
It's just because
you shouldn't pick your butt.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.085
I forgot about that one.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.787
I noticed.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.121
And you're not really
allergic to fruit.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.756
What?

03:42.823 --> 03:46.260
That was a lie that got
a little out of hand.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.995
When you were little,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.530
you really liked fruit.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.300
And every time we had any
in the house,

03:52.366 --> 03:53.734
you'd just gobble it all up

03:53.801 --> 03:55.736
before any of us had
a chance to have any.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.338
So I told you

03:57.405 --> 04:00.674
you were allergic to it,
and you stopped.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.776
So basically, I spent my
whole life getting punked?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.312
She lied to you, not me.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.414
I've always been very strict
about telling you the truth.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.382
But you never
told me the truth.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.117
Because I promised
I'd keep her secrets.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.852
I'm also very strict
about keeping secrets.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.753
As you can see,

04:12.820 --> 04:14.021
it's been my own private hell.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.222
Private hell!

04:15.289 --> 04:17.057
This is all so messed up.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.225
And that's
exactly why

04:18.292 --> 04:19.760
I'm not destroying Lucy's tapes.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.663
I'm learning the truth now,
and one day, Hope will, too.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.633
Do not compare
me to Lucy.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.435
Those videotapes are
way more disturbing

04:27.501 --> 04:29.102
than anything
I ever did.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.237
Oh, I'm pretty disturbed.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.805
I am sorry, Jimmy,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.507
but this is one of
those horrible secrets

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
a parent can never
tell their kids.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.911
Wait. Is there some bigger
secret you're not telling me?

04:37.978 --> 04:40.348
Nope.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.615
Oh, there is.
There is.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.750
What is it?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.618
I'm not telling you.
That's the point.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.086
Weren't you
listening just now?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.355
Well, just tell me.
I can handle it.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.823
Please. You just got
freaked out over fruit.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.291
I'm not telling
you squat.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.233
I don't...

05:00.300 --> 05:01.469
It's been a private hell.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.937
Private hell!

05:04.004 --> 05:06.006
(bubbles popping)
(Maw Maw laughing)

05:13.581 --> 05:16.517
Oh, I can't believe

05:16.584 --> 05:18.051
I've been missing out
on this my whole life.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.521
Fruit is delicious.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.756
Oh, by the way,
I'll pay for this later.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.558
I'm saving the pits
so I know what I ate.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.828
Oh, good. Yeah. 'Cause
I was super concerned.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.996
And get this.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.564
Apparently,
there's some other bigger secret

05:30.631 --> 05:31.665
she says I can't even handle.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.700
Really?

05:32.766 --> 05:33.867
She wouldn't tell
you what it is?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.369
Nope.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.837
Well, you got to find out.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.373
I mean, what if you were born
with both male and female parts,

05:39.440 --> 05:40.374
but they sewed up
the female parts?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.575
(gasps)

05:41.642 --> 05:43.877
Oh, my God.
I figured it out.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.414
I think I'm gonna do
a little more research.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.150
I don't feel right
about this, Jimmy.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.352
Come on, Just a few more.
You're not telling me.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.954
You're just
answering questions.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.527
Uh, Is our family
really 1/16 Pequot Indian?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.194
That one is true.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.731
When I was four, did I really
choke on a potato chip

06:03.797 --> 06:05.833
and when I coughed it up,
it had Jesus' face on it?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.501
I thought it looked more
like Kris Kristofferson,

06:07.568 --> 06:08.936
but yes, that one is true.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.304
Is it true that I had a twin
that I killed in the womb?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.573
That one's unclear.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.176
Is my grandmother,

06:16.243 --> 06:17.678
mom's mom,

06:17.745 --> 06:19.980
really a missionary in Africa
who helps sick kids?

06:26.186 --> 06:27.555
Nice, Burt.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.590
He guessed it.
I didn't say anything.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.192
Fine. It's
about my mother,

06:32.259 --> 06:33.594
but we're not
telling you

06:33.661 --> 06:35.663
what happened,
so you're up a creek.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.433
(chuckling
and bubbles popping)

06:39.500 --> 06:41.201
JIMMY:
And then, I realized

06:41.268 --> 06:42.470
who I could get to tell me

06:42.536 --> 06:43.737
my mother's secret.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.972
(chuckling
and bubbles popping)

06:45.038 --> 06:46.073
Maw Maw.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.175
She's my mom's
mother's mother,

06:48.241 --> 06:49.610
so she knows my grandmother.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.378
See, I made you
this chart.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.846
This is you.
That's me.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.048
That's Mom, and that's
Mom's mom Louise

06:55.115 --> 06:56.917
who didn't really die
as a missionary.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.085
This one,

06:58.151 --> 07:00.387
Maw Maw, can tell
us what happened.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.156
There's a catch.
She's bananas.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.392
Which, by the way,
are amazing.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.695
The best way to talk to Maw Maw
when she's lucid

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
is to wake her
out of a deep sleep.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.700
(gasps)
Who the hell are you?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.101
And where's the gun
I keep under my pillow?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.002
I'm your great-grandson,

07:15.068 --> 07:17.738
and we had to take that
away from you.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.806
You're my great grandson?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.173
But you're fully grown.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.511
That must make me...

07:25.012 --> 07:26.647
Oh, dear God.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.948
Listen, while you're lucid,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.550
I got to talk to you
about something.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.619
Unfortunately, once she's up,

07:31.685 --> 07:32.753
she's only reasonable
for a short time

07:32.820 --> 07:35.155
then she goes back
to being crazy.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.991
Porter, why the hell
has this train stopped?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.727
It takes some
trial and error.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.197
Thing is, you can't try
waking her up again

07:44.264 --> 07:47.868
until you find a way
to soothe her back to sleep.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.070
So this is Mom,
and this is you.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.040
So the question
is about this one here.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.742
The map looks good,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.744
but once we get
down in the bunker,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.946
which one of us
kills Hitler?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.113
(sighs)

08:00.180 --> 08:02.482
(soft snoring)

08:02.550 --> 08:04.785
But eventually,

08:04.852 --> 08:06.386
if you're fast,

08:06.453 --> 08:08.822
you can almost always get
what you need out of her.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.123
That's you. That's me.
That's my mom.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.158
That's her mom...

08:11.224 --> 08:12.392
Who is my daughter Louise.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.527
Right, right, right.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.862
That's your daughter
Louise. Fantastic.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.630
So all I need for the final
piece of this puzzle

08:16.697 --> 08:18.732
is for you to tell me
what happened to her.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.402
Your mother lied to you
for a reason.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.572
Stop digging around.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.610
(groans)

08:31.211 --> 08:33.714
I'm telling you, Hope,
we've got a situation here.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.383
Your grandma wants
to hide your mom's stuff.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.952
Your Boy Scout of a father wants
everything out in the open.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.554
Of course I'm stuck in
the middle like a third nipple.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.955
And on top of it all,

08:42.022 --> 08:43.824
we're talking about
your mom's dying wish.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.693
What if-what if they
throw all this stuff away,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.861
and you never get
a chance to see it?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.863
Oh.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.464
You'll never get to see

08:51.531 --> 08:53.500
these serial killer
trading cards.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.203
Bundy, DeSalvo, Dahmer.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.771
All the great ones are here.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.507
You'll never see this
stack of magazines

09:00.574 --> 09:02.976
with everybody's
eyes cut out.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.211
And look.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.913
She made a voodoo doll
of the warden.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.982
Or Al Roker. I don't know.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.450
I can see why
she'd be mad at both.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.685
Roker bugs me, too.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.153
Thinks he's better
than everybody

09:13.220 --> 09:15.723
'cause he lost weight and
knows when it's going to rain.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.660
Here.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.430
Your mama wanted
you to have this.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.632
You sleep tight with that.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.168
But not so tight
you snap its neck.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.838
People need to know when
to bring an umbrella.

09:37.845 --> 09:38.712
SABRINA:
It's called a star fruit.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.047
We were out of stock

09:40.113 --> 09:42.616
when you went on your
fruit binge the other day.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.218
Oh, my God. This is delicious.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.720
Usually you don't eat
the sticker,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.555
but you seem to be on
kind of a roll, so...

09:48.622 --> 09:50.590
Oh, hey. I found out
my big family secret

09:50.658 --> 09:51.692
has something to do
with my dead grandmother.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.460
Really? Maybe
she's royalty.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.095
Or a spy.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.429
Maybe she's the
"Where's the beef?" lady.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.665
You kind of look like her.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.701
Oh, ask me where the beef is.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.169
Um, I don't think
that's it.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.871
And no one's telling me
anything, so I'm stuck.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.338
Oh, come on. You're
not a giver-upper.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.607
Yesterday, you chased
a grape underneath

10:07.675 --> 10:09.076
a pile of shopping carts
and fished it out

10:09.142 --> 10:10.343
with a mop handle and ate it.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.647
Tell me you at least
checked the Internet.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.982
Uh, we don't have
an Internet thing.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.717
I wanted to get one
in high school, but it's pricey.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.018
Plus, Mom said
the Internet tubes

10:18.085 --> 10:19.953
don't stretch
to this side of town yet.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.321
(sighs)

10:23.423 --> 10:25.959
Stupid lying Mom!

10:26.026 --> 10:27.861
Another thing you need
to know, little princess,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.397
is how to dance sexy.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.165
(beatboxing)

10:43.744 --> 10:44.845
(videotape whirring)

10:49.216 --> 10:50.984
(continues beatboxing)

10:58.859 --> 11:01.361
The Internet tubes
do come here.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.733
You lied about
the Internet tubes.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.734
Shh. The baby's sleeping.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.801
Well, guess what.

11:07.868 --> 11:08.969
It's only a matter of time

11:09.036 --> 11:10.203
before I learn everything
about your mom.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.239
Sabrina says she can find
anything online.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.808
Stupid Internet.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.444
Why can't you kids
leave well enough alone?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.147
Everything was fine until
you started digging around.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.314
(chuckles)

11:21.381 --> 11:23.350
You sound like
a Scooby Doo villain.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.618
And I thought I told you
to destroy those videotapes.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.721
(slurring):
They don't belong to you.
They don't even belong to me.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.422
They're Hope's and she deserves
to know her mother...

11:29.489 --> 11:31.591
What the hell's going on
with your tongue?

11:31.658 --> 11:32.659
I don't know.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.362
My mouth is itchy
and tingly.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.463
Is it because I ate this?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.565
Aha!

11:38.631 --> 11:40.467
You are allergic to a fruit.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.770
See? I was
protecting you.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.805
And if you hadn't gone looking
under rocks for the truth,

11:44.872 --> 11:47.674
you wouldn't have eaten that
thing, and you'd be fine.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.043
Stop digging around.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.979
Too late. Sabrina's gonna
find out the truth

11:52.045 --> 11:53.480
whether you like it or not.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.681
God, this itches!

11:54.748 --> 11:56.449
Fine! You want the truth?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.921
Your grandmother
was killed by a duck.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.626
You just said my grandmother
was killed by a duck?

12:06.693 --> 12:07.928
Yes.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.430
(sighs)

12:11.598 --> 12:13.600
I was two years old.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.869
And there was a beehive
under the eave of the house.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.471
My mother, your grandmother,

12:18.538 --> 12:21.842
got it into her head
that she wanted fresh honey.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.011
She knew there was danger.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.612
So she did
what anyone would do.

12:25.678 --> 12:26.914
She tied

12:26.980 --> 12:28.849
a sealed plastic bag
around her head.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.851
To keep the bees
off her face.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.520
She couldn't get any air.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.022
She got dizzy.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.090
But she didn't think
to take the bag off her head.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.195
So she fell over.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.198
And that's when her head
hit the duck.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.035
Happy?!

12:48.101 --> 12:50.570
Your grandmother was a moron!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.739
As a kid, all the
neighbors would look at me

12:52.806 --> 12:54.875
and whisper, "Poor child.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.710
Her mother
was such an idiot."

12:57.777 --> 12:59.746
I wanted to shield you
from that.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.815
But now you know.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.084
We come from idiot stock.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.085
Happy?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.054
I'm starting to
not be able to breathe.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.094
Oh, it's you.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.063
Barney thought he saw
a homeless lady stealing

13:16.129 --> 13:17.164
on the security camera.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.498
You might want
to get a haircut.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.100
No, see, the star fruit
makes my tongue swell up,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.134
so I have to chase it
with antihistamine.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.569
Good system.
Mm.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.237
Oh, hey, check it out.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.206
Found some stuff on your
grandmother on the Internet.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.308
Turns out, she's got
a fairly decent credit score.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.810
And she bought some
really funky necklaces online.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.179
My grandmother's still alive?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.181
Yeah. She lives in Hillsboro.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.116
Oh, and according to
her last status update,

13:36.183 --> 13:38.285
Salad Plantation just ran out
of Thousand Island.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.086
Frowny face.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.353
What about the bees?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.754
The bag?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.590
The duck?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.825
Oh, son of a bitch.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.160
Mom lied again.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.330
(scoffs)

13:50.397 --> 13:52.065
Where you going
in such a hurry?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.366
You want to know
where I'm going?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.668
Why don't you ask the eel
that lives in my butt.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.538
You had pinworms, smart-ass.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.679
(whispers):
Okay, coast is clear, baby.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.649
Let's look at some more
of your crazy mom's stuff.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.218
Here are some

14:11.284 --> 14:14.854
Polaroids of men sleeping.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.858
Here's your mom's
press clippings.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.028
That's her right here.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.934
"Dear Princess Beyonce..."

14:27.000 --> 14:28.401
That's what she named you.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.603
I miss it. I thought
it was spunky, but...

14:30.670 --> 14:31.939
Anyway.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.174
"Here's my
makeup bag.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.843
"Everything is cruelty free.

14:36.910 --> 14:41.348
Nothing was tested on animals,
because that's mean."

14:41.414 --> 14:44.151
Every time I think this girl's
gonna zig, she zags.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.220
"Do not use any of this
makeup until you're 14,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.522
"or earlier if you're fat.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.458
Love, Mommy."

14:51.524 --> 14:53.160
See, if they throw
all this stuff away,

14:53.226 --> 14:54.694
you'll never get to use this.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.729
And no offense,

14:56.796 --> 14:58.398
but you are a little chunky.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.976
For the record, I don't think
you need all that stuff,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.111
but it's what your mom wanted.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.048
(techno music
playing faintly)

15:15.115 --> 15:17.450
What do you think
my grandmother's gonna be like?

15:17.517 --> 15:20.653
Judging by the music, a
very in-shape gay dude.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.688
(chuckles)

15:22.922 --> 15:24.291
WOMAN:
Who is it?

15:24.357 --> 15:27.860
Uh, we're looking for
Louise Thompson.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.796
That's me.

15:29.862 --> 15:30.998
Wow.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.865
Great to see
some young people.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.567
You look familiar.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.936
Weren't you at that swingers
party in Lake Lucille last year?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.272
(chuckles):
Oh.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.709
Or maybe you don't remember me
from this angle.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.579
(mouthing)
Uh, I think you're
my grandmother.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.480
What?!

15:47.547 --> 15:49.016
I'm Virginia Thompson's son.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.283
You're my grandmother.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.818
Am not.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.986
No.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.688
No, I am not
anybody's grandmother.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.328
How's the crowd in there?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.430
Not too many old farts, I hope.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.874
I don't want to hear it!
Grandma, can we just
talk for a second?

16:14.941 --> 16:15.842
No, no, no.
Grandma, please.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.277
Grandma, I just-- Grandma!

16:17.344 --> 16:19.046
Stop calling me that!

16:19.112 --> 16:21.014
It's who you are.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.649
I was 20 years old,

16:22.715 --> 16:24.717
and I wanted to give Virginia
up for adoption.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.087
As you can see, I'm not
the mothering type.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.555
But Maw Maw
wouldn't hear of it.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.057
She wanted me
to keep Virginia.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.358
We had a fight.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.493
I said, "Fine,
raise her yourself,

16:33.560 --> 16:36.096
but make up a story so she
doesn't come looking for me."

16:36.163 --> 16:37.430
SABRINA:
Your mom didn't
lie to you.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.399
She really believes the
falling on the duck story.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.035
About a woman
going after honey?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.636
With a bag on her head?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.373
I can't believe she
used that story.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.475
That was in
a Reader's Digest we saw.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.843
You know, we're still
at the same house.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.280
You should come and visit,
get to know your daughter.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.982
I'm sure she'd be
cool with your...

16:56.049 --> 16:57.384
hobby.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.286
I chose this for my life.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.121
I don't want
to change anything.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.922
I'm sorry, kid.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.126
This is all the family I need.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.995
I have a whole
new understanding

17:09.062 --> 17:12.099
of why grandmothers cover
their furniture in plastic.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.634
Stop it!

17:16.269 --> 17:17.504
Unbelievable.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.072
I'm sorry he did
this to you.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.874
Oh, I had a bad night, too.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.743
I don't even know
what's up anymore.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.280
I've been so mad at mom
for keeping secrets from me,

17:27.347 --> 17:28.781
but, you know,
she just thought

17:28.848 --> 17:30.750
she was protecting me
from an ugly truth.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.853
And that truth
was a lie Maw Maw told,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.223
because she was protecting Mom
from an even uglier truth:

17:36.289 --> 17:38.758
that Louise
had abandoned her.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.461
Maw Maw figured it was better
for Mom to think

17:41.528 --> 17:43.663
Louise had passed away
than to find out

17:43.730 --> 17:46.399
she had a mom who left home
and didn't care.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.368
I don't want us to have secrets
in our family,

17:48.435 --> 17:50.303
but what's the point
of being honest

17:50.370 --> 17:52.705
if it breaks
someone's heart?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.441
(toilet flushes)

17:54.507 --> 17:55.808
Oh, looky who's back.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.579
Where'd you run off to, anyway?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.548
I, uh...

18:03.483 --> 18:05.918
Sabrina, uh, told me they got in
something called a kumquat,

18:05.985 --> 18:07.687
and, you know,
I had to try it.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.156
For four hours?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.823
They're really good.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.092
I ended up eating all of them.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.461
See why I lied?

18:14.527 --> 18:17.464
You hog all the damn fruit.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.831
(sighs)

18:21.000 --> 18:22.302
Hey, man.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.537
You didn't
tell her that I did

18:24.604 --> 18:25.838
all the makeup
or anything, did you?

18:25.905 --> 18:29.409
No, your secret's safe with me.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.011
All the family secrets
are safe with me.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.347
Thanks.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.483
It's a private hell, isn't it?

18:36.549 --> 18:37.817
It's a private hell.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.561
VIRGINIA:
Are you sure this is
suitable for kids?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
Oh, Sabrina helped me
transfer it to a computer

18:50.697 --> 18:52.599
and fiddled with it.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.002
JIMMY (voice-over):
Dear Hope,

18:56.068 --> 18:57.870
this is a video
from your mother.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.272
She thinks a lot of you.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.907
My beautiful,
beloved daughter...

19:00.973 --> 19:03.376
JIMMY:
She wanted you to have
a record of her love.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.444
LUCY:
And maybe with luck,

19:04.511 --> 19:06.679
a few nuggets of my wisdom.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.181
JIMMY:
Like any good mother,

19:08.248 --> 19:09.816
she cared about
your education...

19:09.882 --> 19:12.552
I want you to understand
the importance of books.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.388
In here, a book saved my life.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.556
JIMMY:
...your health...

19:16.623 --> 19:19.926
Oatmeal is so good for you.
(chuckles)

19:19.992 --> 19:22.094
JIMMY:
And she wanted you to learn
the basic moves required

19:22.161 --> 19:23.630
for doing hula hoop.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.932
(beatboxing)

19:27.800 --> 19:30.237
Amazing, Jimmy!

19:30.303 --> 19:31.771
Thanks.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.173
If you edit out all the
violence, cursing, threatening,

19:34.241 --> 19:37.344
and graphic lesbian sex,
Lucy's actually kind of sweet.

19:39.212 --> 19:42.249
(humming light melody,
snapping )

19:45.752 --> 19:49.088
* You're the apple in my eye *

19:49.155 --> 19:52.825
* You're the peaches in my pie *

19:52.892 --> 19:57.029
* You're the blue in my sky *

19:57.096 --> 20:00.433
* You're everything to me *

20:00.500 --> 20:04.371
* You're the icing on my cake *

20:04.437 --> 20:07.774
* You're the smile
when I awake *

20:07.840 --> 20:11.244
* You're everything to me *

20:11.311 --> 20:13.413
(humming light melody)

20:22.622 --> 20:27.059
* You're everything to me *

20:27.126 --> 20:29.028
I still can't believe
you hit that, Jimmy.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.298
Thanks, Dad.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.973
*

21:04.163 --> 21:05.598
CHILD: Thanks for watching.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.899
(laughs)
