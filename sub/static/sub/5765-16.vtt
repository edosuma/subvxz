WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.291
Well, let's start
with soft targets.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.662
These are reductions
you can make

00:06.700 --> 00:08.998
without further layoffs
or reorganization.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.307
(remote clicks, monitor beeps)

00:13.340 --> 00:14.500
Is one of them IT?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.144
Why don't you just tell us?

00:16.180 --> 00:18.148
Certainly. Annually,

00:18.180 --> 00:20.341
you spend $10,000
on paper products.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.143
Cups.
You're kidding.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.248
We would suggest moving

00:23.290 --> 00:25.019
to a self-policing
hydration policy.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.579
You spend $38,000

00:28.620 --> 00:30.759
on season tickets
to the Chicago Cubs.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.599
Yeah, but that's good business.

00:32.630 --> 00:33.756
We entertain clients.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.153
We would suggest
season tickets

00:35.200 --> 00:36.792
for a less expensive
sport franchise,

00:36.830 --> 00:38.718
the Chicago Red Stars.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.590
The...?

00:40.640 --> 00:41.664
Professional women's soccer.

00:42.740 --> 00:45.061
We got to cut somewhere.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.634
CONSULTANT:
The floral budget for
the firm is $28,000.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.171
Yup. Cut somewhere.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.643
We would suggest moving

00:50.680 --> 00:51.772
to perennials
or going artificial.

00:51.810 --> 00:55.268
We also suggest you no longer
validate for parking.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.788
The self-policing

00:57.820 --> 01:01.415
hydration policy would
be presented as going green

01:01.460 --> 01:02.859
with fact sheets
posted next to coolers

01:02.890 --> 01:04.755
on reducing landfills.
(sighs)

01:04.790 --> 01:06.826
(phone ringing)

01:06.860 --> 01:09.226
(woman talking indistinctly
in background)

01:10.300 --> 01:12.188
Hello.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.798
Oh, it's...

01:13.840 --> 01:15.432
Uh, hi. Is, uh...?

01:15.470 --> 01:18.530
Uh, no. Alicia left her phone
at home.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.629
Oh.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.773
You want to leave a message?

01:23.810 --> 01:26.119
No. She's with another lavwer.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.141
I'll try him. Thanks.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.516
Okay.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.279
(dialing phone)

01:38.690 --> 01:40.157
Good morning.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.258
Dorfman & Associates.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.825
Sorry, we don't have our
phones in yet, Mr. Gardner.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.825
Let me tell Alicia.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.667
Mr. Gardner wants you
to start without him.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.861
DORFMAN:
Thanks. Can you get us coffee?

01:48.900 --> 01:51.334
Partners offices here.

01:51.370 --> 01:52.735
Conference room there.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.735
Waiting room.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.169
I think this is some kind
of flowing thing.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.347
What is it?

01:57.380 --> 01:58.540
WOMAN:
A glassed-in
waterfall.

01:58.580 --> 01:59.717
My daughter's
the designer.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.240
We have the drwNall
in next week.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.783
Wow. No longer a mom-and-pop
operation, huh?

02:03.820 --> 02:05.219
Last time we saw you,
it was in a storefront.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.150
Not quite Stern, Lockhart,
but we're on our way.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.316
You're walking
through a wall.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.622
Oh. Sorry.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.218
WOMAN:
We heard Stern, Lockhart
was in trouble.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.557
Tammy.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.397
No. We've had a few layoffs,
but we're steady now.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.920
Where's all the money
coming from?

02:15.960 --> 02:17.359
DORFMAN:
Insider trading.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.662
Dad's joking.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.190
New corporate clients and

02:20.240 --> 02:22.231
a depressed
retail market.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.407
CARY:
What's this?

02:23.440 --> 02:26.705
The world's 14 highest peaks.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.504
Annapurna, Broad Peak, Makalu.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.574
You climbed these?

02:30.610 --> 02:31.747
Two left.
Dad's hobby.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.179
I don't know how
it happened--

02:33.220 --> 02:35.245
the outdoorsman sired
a homebody.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.349
(laughs)

02:36.390 --> 02:38.244
So, shall we join suits?

02:38.290 --> 02:40.281
I'm all right
if we combine lawsuits,

02:40.320 --> 02:41.480
but we really need to combine.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.657
No stabbing in the back.

02:42.690 --> 02:43.918
You represent

02:43.960 --> 02:46.258
the union employees,
we represent the nonunion.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.494
Yeah.
You have something
written up?

02:47.530 --> 02:48.656
Over a handshake.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.826
That's how I do everything.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.269
We're junior associates.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.562
We do everything in writing.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.862
(laughing):
Okay.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.231
MAN:
Federal agents!

02:55.270 --> 02:56.737
Put your hands on your head now!

02:56.770 --> 02:58.431
MAN:
All right, spread out.
Everything goes--

02:58.470 --> 03:00.301
computers, files,

03:00.340 --> 03:02.479
every box.
DORFMAN:
Come on, Rivers.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.841
This is harassment.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.370
No, Eric. This
is an arrest.

03:05.410 --> 03:06.616
DORFMAN:
For what?

03:07.720 --> 03:08.812
RIVERS:
Maybe you didn't hear.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.841
Hands on
your head.
Ma'am.
Hey!

03:10.890 --> 03:11.879
Come on. These are my lawyers.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.456
They'll have me
out in 24 hours.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.809
RIVERS:
Not this time.
Okay, okay.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.259
What's the charge
this time, Rivers?

03:16.290 --> 03:17.325
First degree murder.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.622
(handcuffs clicking)

03:18.660 --> 03:19.957
Who did I kill?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.456
Kelli Gerber Smith.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.797
Oh, come on, you lost a case.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.593
When I lose a case,
I don't go pee on your lawn.

03:24.630 --> 03:25.995
She was innocent,

03:26.030 --> 03:28.191
and you gave her over
to that scum.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.477
Hey, that's ours.

03:32.510 --> 03:35.479
Sir, we are lavwers with Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.000
We are not employees
of this firm.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.506
And we do not grant
you permission

03:38.550 --> 03:39.676
to confiscate
our work product.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.642
Well, given
that I can't distinguish

03:41.680 --> 03:43.011
between work product
in the field,

03:43.050 --> 03:44.586
I'll segregate the files, and

03:44.620 --> 03:46.679
you can get a court order
to have them returned.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.688
Well...
No.

03:52.530 --> 03:53.792
(indistinct voices on video)

03:53.830 --> 03:54.990
WILL:
What's his name?

03:55.030 --> 03:56.019
CARY:
AUSA Rivers.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.391
It's federal.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.261
I don't know the cast
of characters.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.961
DORFMAN:
These are my lavwers.
They'll have me out in 24 hours.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.365
What's he saying?
ALICIA:
He telling them

04:02.410 --> 04:03.206
that we're his lawyers,

04:03.240 --> 04:05.333
and we will get him
out in 24 hours.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.473
Uh, you led him to believe that?

04:06.510 --> 04:07.636
CARY:
No.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.648
No. We were there
on the furlough lawsuit.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.342
The metro suit.
We decided to marry union

04:12.380 --> 04:13.517
and nonunion.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.744
So why did Dorfman
get arrested

04:14.780 --> 04:15.815
for murder?

04:15.850 --> 04:16.987
Well, Dorfman was defending

04:17.020 --> 04:18.783
a drug dealer,
and there was this witness

04:18.820 --> 04:20.048
testifying for the prosecution,

04:20.090 --> 04:21.887
a Kelli Gerber Smith.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.023
Supposedly,
Dorfman gave her name

04:23.060 --> 04:25.779
to his client, the drug dealer,
who then had her killed.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.397
Who was the drug dealer?

04:28.430 --> 04:29.795
LeMond Bishop.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.898
Bishop's one
of Dorfman's clients?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.034
Uh, he wanted us to take
over his ongoing cases,

04:38.070 --> 04:39.537
just while he's being held.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.377
He doesn't have his
staff lined up yet.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.446
He also wants us to
argue for hIS release.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.711
He can pay us.
WILL:
It's a drug case.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.014
First things the Feds will do
is freeze his assets.

04:50.050 --> 04:53.679
He can pay us when
they're unfrozen.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.021
He seemed good.

04:59.060 --> 05:01.995
Yeah. We'll _take it
under reVIew.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.128
What was that about?

05:05.170 --> 05:07.934
Either they don't like him,
or the rumors are true--

05:07.970 --> 05:11.030
Stern, Lockhart's
going down.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.608
Oh, damn it.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.404
And I have
student loans.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.418
COURTNEY:
Alicia?

05:19.450 --> 05:20.041
Your husband.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.547
Yeah, at least

05:21.580 --> 05:23.582
you have someone
to fall back on.

05:24.820 --> 05:25.946
No, no. No, it's nothing.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.617
I just can't find
the tax returns.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.718
And why do you need them?

05:28.760 --> 05:29.727
You know Eli.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.681
He needs to look

05:30.730 --> 05:32.618
into anything
that can be used against us.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.797
Uh-huh. Uh,

05:33.830 --> 05:35.354
under my bed

05:35.400 --> 05:37.095
in a box marked,
I think, house files.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.461
Good. Thanks.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.058
How are you doing?

05:40.100 --> 05:42.409
Well, I was almost got arrested
this morning.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.702
You... What?

05:43.740 --> 05:45.503
Do you know
an AUSA named Rivers?

05:45.540 --> 05:46.677
Yeah.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.769
Very intense guy.
Out to save the world.

05:48.810 --> 05:49.947
Why, what happened?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.174
He was arresting
this other lawyer...

05:51.210 --> 05:53.440
It's a long story, but I almost
got caught up in the sweep.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.412
He's a zealot.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.042
Never look a zealot in the eyes.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.616
How are you?

05:57.650 --> 05:58.947
Good.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.457
I made a BLT.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.549
I'm very proud of myself.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.421
You know, this is the closest

06:04.460 --> 06:05.882
we've had _
to a normal conversation.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.852
Yeah. I like it.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.391
Maybe we should talk
on the phone more.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.496
Speaking of which,
you left your cell phone here.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.996
Will called.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.463
Yeah.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.728
He already got in touch.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.442
Okay, back to work.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.448
Back to work.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.120
(sighs)

07:05.790 --> 07:08.452
I say judges are skins
this time.

07:14.830 --> 07:15.956
Hello.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.195
Mr. Gardner,
AUSA Rivers.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.494
That's okay. We won't
hold it against you.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.859
Suit up.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.162
You phoned.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.768
You wanted your
work product back.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.539
Yeah, but at my office.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.979
This is a friendly County game.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.570
You're thinking about
taking the Dorfman case.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.714
We would advise
against It.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.547
(players chattering
indistinctly)

07:35.980 --> 07:38.141
Mr. Gardner, you're
having money issues.

07:38.190 --> 07:40.818
You can't afford troubles
with the federal courts.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.725
(laughs)

07:42.760 --> 07:44.580
Wow.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.598
This is like the movies.

07:46.630 --> 07:49.497
You have to threaten me
with an audit or something.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.020
Oh, that's the IRS.

07:51.070 --> 07:54.494
It would be a federal crime
to influence the IRS.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.838
Guys, I'm being threatened
over here.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.167
Can you believe it?

07:58.210 --> 08:00.508
Ooh...
Poor baby.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.668
Mr. Dorfman is in trouble.

08:03.710 --> 08:07.043
He is guilty,
and his assets are frozen.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.048
It would be a mistake

08:09.080 --> 08:11.048
to represent him.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.751
Too late. I already am.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.758
As of when?

08:14.790 --> 08:16.587
As of ten seconds ago.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.029
Congratulations, Rivers.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.221
You just won Dorfman
an attorney.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.593

CBS TELEVISION

08:39.620 --> 08:41.576
ELI:
This is how it works.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.111
Germs enter
the political bloodstream

08:44.150 --> 08:45.879
via anonymous
Twitter accounts.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.218
These are picked up
by political blogs that...

08:48.260 --> 08:50.649
I'm going
to drop that metaphor.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.897
Why? No. No. Keep going.
See where it takes you.

08:52.930 --> 08:56.661
There's an anonymous Twitter
account out there-- Upriser7.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.066
It's saying things
about you and Alicia.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.900
Well, isn't that, uh,
to be expected?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.766
Some of them are true.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.937
Like what?

09:08.980 --> 09:12.245
"Saint Alicia, as she's called
behind her back, is despised

09:12.280 --> 09:14.339
"because of her close_ connection
to boss, WIll.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.940
Widely hated,
she's given all best cases."

09:16.990 --> 09:18.582
Are we saying that's true?

09:18.620 --> 09:21.316
"Alicia and Peter sleep
in separate rooms.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.225
"He is in maids quarters.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.683
She's in the master.
Not even a real marriage."

09:27.660 --> 09:30.663
So, the danger is that it'll be
picked by a political blog,

09:30.700 --> 09:31.826
and then move
into the mainstream.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.361
ELI: I mean, I can reduce
the damage by flooding the zone

09:34.400 --> 09:36.630
with bogus tweets
that say the opposite.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.638
Any search engine
will be overwhelmed by both.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.137
Wait a minute.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.968
Who knew
that we are In separate rooms?

09:45.880 --> 09:48.314
There's also stuff
about Mrs. Florrick's work,

09:48.350 --> 09:49.840
her competition
for a job,

09:49.890 --> 09:51.380
and her connection
with her boss.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.751
What did that one say?

09:52.790 --> 09:53.984
You don't want
to read it.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.180
That she's sleeping
with him.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.668
All right.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.294
Let's find out
who's sending these tweets.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.179
Thank you, Mr. Gardner.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.178
My father is
just so thankful.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.643
No problem.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.704
We'll see what we can do.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.674
(indistinct chatter,
woman laughing)

10:20.720 --> 10:22.017
(chattering, laughing)

10:22.050 --> 10:24.382
WILL:
Yup.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.785
Not my playground.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.412
BAILIFF:
All rise.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.280
(whispers)

10:29.320 --> 10:31.686
Mr. Rivers,
what do we have today?

10:31.730 --> 10:33.220
Several motions on Eric Dorfman,
Your Honor.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.989
And I'm sorry to hear
about your accident.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.861
Thank you.
I got your card.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.688
I imagine you're seeking
detention pending trial?

10:40.740 --> 10:41.434
Yes, Your Honor.

10:41.470 --> 10:42.232
Mr. Dorfman,
in our opinion,

10:42.270 --> 10:44.101
released a witness list
to a killer,

10:44.140 --> 10:45.664
and given that there will be

10:45.710 --> 10:47.007
vuln_erabl_e witnesses
mmmwm,

10:47.040 --> 10:48.735
we ask for
pretrial detention.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.340
WILL: Your Honor, this is
a simple case of harassment.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.178
AUSA Rivers failed to convict
LeMond Bishop on RICO charges

10:54.220 --> 10:55.778
and is now going after

10:55.820 --> 10:56.980
his lawyer as
retribution.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.749
In your opinion?

10:58.790 --> 11:00.758
Excuse me?

11:00.790 --> 11:01.711
In your opinion?

11:01.760 --> 11:02.954
Yes, in my opinion.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.458
He's trying to subvert the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.129
RIVERS: Mr. Gardner is prone
to hyperbole, Your Honor.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.765
Kelli Gerber Smith offered
to testify against

11:10.800 --> 11:13.098
one of the most dangerous
kingpins in this country,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.437
and in our opinion,

11:14.470 --> 11:15.937
was brutally tortured
and murdered

11:15.970 --> 11:18.404
for her troubles.
Your Honor,

11:18.440 --> 11:20.738
the prosecution's evidence
is thin at best.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.749
Generic carpet fibers
found on the body,

11:23.780 --> 11:26.749
access to a witness list.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.338
That hardly makes Eric Dorfman
suspect number one.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.449
In your opinion.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.948
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.481
I thought it was obvious,
when I speak, it's my opinion,

11:34.520 --> 11:35.851
and when he speaks, it's his.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.085
CARY:
Oh, boy.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.085
Mister. . .?

11:39.130 --> 11:40.791
Gardner, Your Honor.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.821
It is equally obvious
that I'm a judge,

11:42.870 --> 11:44.963
and yet you continually
refer to me as "Your Honor."

11:45.000 --> 11:47.764
All I ask is that you do
the same with your opinion,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.802
and remind yourself
and the court

11:49.840 --> 11:50.807
that it is in fact your opinion.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.141
RIVERS: Your Honor,
if I could return to the facts.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.977
Mr. Dorfman was one of four
people to hold the wntness list

12:00.020 --> 12:02.170
that was sealed
under a court order.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.347
There were carpet fibers
found on the tarp

12:04.390 --> 12:05.379
covering Ms. Smith's body

12:05.420 --> 12:08.480
that came directly
from Mr. Dorfman's law firm.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.853
And in our opinion, he was the
only one with anything to gain

12:11.890 --> 12:13.118
if her name got out.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.957
This is a vindictive
prosecution

12:15.000 --> 12:16.968
and should be treated as such.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.365
In my opinion.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.765
The court disagrees,
Mr. Gardner,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.859
and orders pretrial detention.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.765
I'll see you both back here
on Wednesday

12:23.810 --> 12:25.505
at 9:00 am.
for pretrial motions.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.838
(gavelbangs)
DIANE:
It's their courtyard,

12:27.880 --> 12:29.871
you play by their rules.
They're so coclq.

12:29.910 --> 12:30.672
It's just another
courtroom,

12:30.710 --> 12:32.871
and they treat it
like St. Peter's.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.945
No, we agreed to cut
the flowers and paper cups.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.117
The least I can do
is take the cases I want.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.549
You sure this
Isn't pride?

12:40.590 --> 12:42.080
Of course, it's pride.
What's wrong with pride?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.326
Pride built the pyramids.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.089
And Watergate.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.098
God, those do look fake.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.121
Those are the
real ones.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.394
Okay, four people had access
to that witness list.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.432
Find out who they were,
where it went.

12:54.470 --> 12:56.563
Rivers, the court clerk,
Dorfman, the judge.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.532
Good.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.209
Now, did they or anyone
around them leak it?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.879
Also let's look at the
prosecution's assumptions:

13:02.910 --> 13:04.798
the witness in this
original case...

13:04.850 --> 13:05.748
Kelli Gerber Smith.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.509
Are we sure she was even
actually murdered

13:07.550 --> 13:08.744
due to the case?

13:08.780 --> 13:10.816
And if she was, did the killers
really need the witness list

13:10.850 --> 13:12.010
to know she was going
to testify?

13:12.050 --> 13:13.551
How do we find that out?

13:13.590 --> 13:14.887
Go to Bishop.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.926
You want to go ask
a drug kingpin

13:18.960 --> 13:21.121
whether he really needed
a witness list to kill somebody?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.560
Well, there's probably
a better way to put it.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.818
But in theory, he wants
his lawyer out, too,

13:25.870 --> 13:27.565
and if he could help steer us
towards evidence

13:27.600 --> 13:29.295
that would exonerate
Dorfman, that'd be good.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.205
You up for it?

13:31.240 --> 13:32.901
Sure.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.217
KALIN DA:
Uh, excuse me.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.047
Mr. Bishop?

13:46.090 --> 13:49.355
So you're my
lawyer's lawyer?

13:49.390 --> 13:51.085
Actually, she is.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.279
MAN:
Arms out, ladies.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.922
It's all right.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.188
The lawyers are on our side.
Didn't you hear, Tony?

13:55.230 --> 13:56.527
When we were picking sides,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.960
they got the cops;
we got the lavwers.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.467
Beautiful horses.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.967
They're not mine.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.500
Rich people need places
to board them.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.508
One of your legit
businesses?

14:06.540 --> 14:08.474
Hey, I'm all legit
these days.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.501
Isn't that right?
TONY:
It IS.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.903
So you wanted help with Dorfman?

14:11.950 --> 14:13.110
Good.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.310
I like him.

14:14.350 --> 14:15.647
Did he show you his
rock collection?

14:15.680 --> 14:16.886
I think he just picked

14:16.920 --> 14:18.114
those rocks up off the street.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.289
Guy has these rocks from the
top peaks from around the world.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.311
Everest?
No, not that
one yet.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.981
Mountain climbing never
made much sense to me.

14:26.030 --> 14:28.157
Bunch of idiots
who just need something to do.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.896
But he's a
good lavwer.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.124
And lucky.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.468
We didn't even have to go to
trial with that witness dying.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.491
You mean being murdered.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.003
Mr. Dorfman
has been accused

14:43.050 --> 14:44.506
of leaking
the witness's identity,

14:44.550 --> 14:46.040
allowing you
to murder her.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.048
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,

14:50.090 --> 14:52.308
he didn't do that
because I didn't do that.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.988
Right.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.351
But if you could steer us

14:55.390 --> 14:56.982
in the direction
of what really happened,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.622
I think that could help
Mr. Dorfman.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.025
"What really happened"?

15:02.130 --> 15:03.666
Is there some evidence

15:03.700 --> 15:06.965
that points to the murder
happening for other reasons?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.468
Reasons that didn't
reqUIre the Witness list.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.001
_ I own a chain
of SIX sporting good stores,

15:14.040 --> 15:16.508
four restaurants,
ten dry cleaners.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.700
I am a businessman.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.706
So I don't want you making
the same mistake

15:19.750 --> 15:20.978
as the government,

15:21.020 --> 15:24.945
thinking that, because of the
color of my skin, I sell drugs.

15:24.990 --> 15:28.551
Because that would be racism,
wouldn't it?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.627
Well, this is an exciting day.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.662
You wanted to come.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.725
So...

15:39.770 --> 15:41.965
here's the thing.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.967
I won't say much,

15:43.010 --> 15:44.409
I won't answer questions,

15:44.440 --> 15:46.601
but Bishop likes
Mr. Dorfman,

15:46.640 --> 15:48.631
thinks he got
a raw deal.
We do, too.

15:48.680 --> 15:53.014
Rivers found the black SUV
that carried this dead witness.

15:56.050 --> 15:59.281
so it may not be as clean
as one would hope.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.948
Was Dorfman ever in this SUV?

16:04.790 --> 16:07.998
Again, if there is
any attempt to subpoena

16:08.030 --> 16:11.420
or question myself or
Mr. Bishop, we will deny this.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.734
But Rivers found the SUV
two weeks ago,

16:13.770 --> 16:16.534
right after the murder, and he's
kept it under wraps ever since.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.208
Why?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.605
Keep it out
of your hands.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.608
Surprise you at trial.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.245
We would advise you
to fight its inclusion.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.271
Talk about a pact
with the devil.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.187
We're taking trial advice
from killers.

16:30.220 --> 16:31.380
Objection, Your Honor.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.389
This SUV was kept from
us intentionally.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.081
The only reason the court
knows about it at all

16:36.120 --> 16:37.257
is because
we brought it up.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.780
It should be thrown out.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.127
I'll give you some leeway,
Rivers. Go ahead.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.594
RIVERS:
In addition, Your Honor,

16:42.630 --> 16:44.222
we discovered
an impre55ion

16:44.270 --> 16:46.693
made on the console
from a hastily written note--

16:46.730 --> 16:48.095
"Gerbre."

16:48.140 --> 16:49.198
This of course

16:49.240 --> 16:50.366
was the middle name
of the victim,

16:50.410 --> 16:53.629
and as you can see the last
two letters were inverted.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.604
This clearly matches

16:56.640 --> 16:59.074
the accidental inversion
made on the witness list.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.247
We submit it into evidence.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.747
Objection!

17:01.780 --> 17:03.714
Again, Your Honor,
this evidence

17:03.750 --> 17:05.445
was intentionally
withheld from us,

17:05.490 --> 17:07.310
summarily removed
from all exhibit lists,

17:07.360 --> 17:09.180
and should be excluded.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.323
In your opinion.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.782
Yes, in my opinion.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.798
While Mr. Gardner
and his white-shoe firm

17:13.830 --> 17:16.719
may have the resources to
process evidence expeditiously,

17:16.760 --> 17:19.126
in our opinion, Your Honor,

17:19.170 --> 17:21.161
the federal government does not.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.363
Not according to your
own lab's time stamp.

17:24.410 --> 17:27.504
In my opinion,
Mr. Rivers was holding on

17:27.540 --> 17:29.508
to this key discovery evidence
for weeks, Your Honor,

17:29.540 --> 17:31.804
lying to this court about
its very existence.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.579
Mr. Gardner is working
with old information,

17:33.620 --> 17:35.417
in our opinion.

17:35.450 --> 17:36.849
I would submit
this reVI5ion

17:36.880 --> 17:38.643
of the evidence room
stamp.
Objection.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.385
I'll accept.
Continue, Rivers.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.388
Thank you.
I would like to name...

17:42.420 --> 17:43.853
Excuse me, Your Honor,
I objected.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.152
Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner,

17:45.190 --> 17:47.351
and I accepted
Mr. Rivers' evidence.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.197
Yes, but you failed to rule.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.562
My ruling is implicit,
Mr. Gardner.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.828
Now, sit down.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.235
No, it isn't, Your Honor.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.795
And I will sit down
when you rule.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.877
Would you like to be held
in contempt, Mr. Gardner?

18:01.910 --> 18:02.808
No, I would not, Your Honor,

18:02.840 --> 18:04.876
but I would like a ruling
on my objection.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.844
You are trying my patience...

18:06.880 --> 18:09.872
I understand that, Your Honor,
but we both know

18:09.920 --> 18:11.319
if you don't use the proper

18:11.350 --> 18:12.886
form of "sustained"
or "overruled,"

18:12.920 --> 18:14.319
the matter can't later
be appealed.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.112
And I was surprised

18:16.160 --> 18:17.855
in reviewing
your past court cases,

18:17.890 --> 18:20.358
how often you encouraged lavwers
to move on

18:20.400 --> 18:22.652
without actually ruling,
therefore avoided having

18:22.700 --> 18:24.361
your nonrulings
overturned on appeal.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.565
In my opinion.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.158
Mr. Gardner, I have

18:30.210 --> 18:32.633
never been quite so offended

18:32.670 --> 18:34.809
in all my years
on the bench.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.707
I understand that, Your Honor,
but I still want a ruling.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.240
A ruling I can appeal.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.210
Your Honor,

18:43.250 --> 18:45.343
this evidence is necessary
for our prosecution.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.881
A conviction is necessary
for your prosecution.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.353
That doesn't make it
a worthy argument.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.823
JUDGE:
One hour for lunch.
Your Honor...

18:50.860 --> 18:52.725
I said, one
hour for lunch.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.227
(gavelbangs)

18:58.270 --> 19:00.238
RIVERS:
What the hell was that?

19:00.270 --> 19:02.261
Do you have a map?
Do I have a what?

19:02.300 --> 19:04.165
A map so I can show
you where you live.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.269
That, my friend,
was a Chicago defense.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.676
Get used to it.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.384
Even if the judge
kicks the SUV,

19:22.420 --> 19:23.626
which given my courtroom
performance,

19:23.660 --> 19:24.729
isn't all that likely...

19:24.760 --> 19:26.819
ALICIA:
Although fun.
...we still need to undercut

19:26.860 --> 19:28.748
the carpet fibers
from Dorfman's office.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.462
That's the only thing
that ties him to the body.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.798
Dorfman's carpet
is US Taupe Dream.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.899
It's one_ of the most
common in the country.
Good.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.498
Anything on the witness list?
KALINDA:
Yeah.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.861
Two other prosecutors in Rivers'
office had access to it.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.434
They were listed
on the initial ﬁling

19:41.480 --> 19:42.833
before Rivers
took over the case.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.973
I'm data-mining
them now to find

19:45.010 --> 19:46.739
any connection
with Bishop's crew.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.271
All right, Cary,
you stay on the carpet.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.685
And, Kalinda,
you stay on the data-mining.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.779
And, uh...

19:52.820 --> 19:54.811
I'll go back to my office.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.659
Yes, I do have a home.
Good.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.225
Maybe you should try
using it.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.464
Interesting case?

20:07.500 --> 20:08.660
Yes.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.406
May I help you, Mr. Gold?

20:11.910 --> 20:14.538
"Saint Alicia is not just
sleeping with her boss, she is

20:14.580 --> 20:16.275
also using him
to get promoted."

20:16.310 --> 20:18.244
Upriser7-- a tweet.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.339
About, uh, two hours ago.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.371
About me?
Yes. And Peter.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.785
But mostly you.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.310
At first,

20:25.350 --> 20:27.386
I thought it was intended
to derail

20:27.420 --> 20:28.819
Peter's campaign,
butthen

20:28.860 --> 20:32.023
I realized, no...
it's about you.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.255
We're just
collateral damage.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.824
This is on the Internet?
Yes.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.364
And Ben Smith just linked to it
as part of a remainder item,

20:39.400 --> 20:41.493
so it may get
wider play.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.462
Please excuse the melodrama,

20:43.510 --> 20:47.469
but do you think there's anybody
here who's got it out for you?

20:50.040 --> 20:53.419
Young guy, 12:00?

20:53.450 --> 20:55.270
But would he know that

20:55.320 --> 20:57.584
you and Peter are
in separate rooms?

20:57.620 --> 20:58.882
That's in here?

20:58.920 --> 20:59.841
Even mentions the name

20:59.890 --> 21:02.256
of the moving company
that put the bed in.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.385
"Saint Alicia"
doesn't sound like him.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.295
That's the thing
about the Internet.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.491
Nobody sounds like they seem.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.732
(laughter)

21:13.770 --> 21:15.328
Hi.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.997
Want to make a call,
Mrs. Florrick?

21:17.040 --> 21:18.928
No, um, Ijust...

21:18.970 --> 21:21.438
It's...

21:23.850 --> 21:25.147
You know the movers

21:25.180 --> 21:28.343
who came_ out last week
to put in the bed?
Your apartment? Yes.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.610
Is there any way Cary
could've heard about that?

21:30.650 --> 21:33.312
Heard the movers
put in another bed?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.749
Yes.
No.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.348
No, I don't mean on purpose.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.994
I'm discreet, Mrs. Florrick.
Yes, of course.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.827
It's not... it's just, you know,
the Bluetooth.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.361
Sometimes you can be

21:44.400 --> 21:46.925
near someone. . .

21:46.970 --> 21:48.289
Never mind. Forget it.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.902
(door closes)

22:16.160 --> 22:18.628
(sighs)

22:18.670 --> 22:22.436
Yes, hello. Um, can you stop
Mr. Gold from leaving?

22:22.470 --> 22:24.461
I think he left...

22:26.010 --> 22:28.001
My mistake.
Uh, never mind.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.428
Kalinda.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.471
What's up?

23:03.510 --> 23:04.602
(whispers):
Can you come into my ofﬁce?

23:07.050 --> 23:08.517
Certainly, ma'am.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.415
Can you look inside that bag?

23:15.090 --> 23:17.081
Wow.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.929
Where did that come from?

23:18.960 --> 23:20.951
I have no idea.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.039
$200,000 and the vague whiff
of marijuana.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.637
(sighs)

23:32.670 --> 23:34.433
What did you say to him?
ALICIA:
Bishop?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.072
Nothing. We just asked
about the murder.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.134
What's up?

23:37.180 --> 23:39.501
And why does it smell like
a frat house in here?

23:39.550 --> 23:40.778
Oh.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.042
Bishop?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.443
Our best guess.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.481
I'll make the call.

23:49.090 --> 23:50.648
It's your retainer.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.487
DIANE:
I didn't know
you were hiring.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.020
I'm not.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.425
I need new lawyers.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.897
Don't you already have
representation?

23:59.930 --> 24:01.966
In jail.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.638
I need someone now.

24:03.670 --> 24:04.864
Business is piling up.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.639
WILL:
This is a bit unorthodox.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.501
We represent
your current lawyer.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.679
Yes. My experience is
lawyers are good

24:10.710 --> 24:13.144
at making the unorthodox
orthodox.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.511
Why us?

24:15.280 --> 24:17.510
One of my aides
saw him in court.

24:18.550 --> 24:21.018
I was off-script.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.152
Nice touch bringing
the black guy.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.583
For your information,
I'm an equity partner.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.518
Where you from?

24:27.560 --> 24:29.152
None of your business.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.519
I have a corporation,

24:32.570 --> 24:35.038
a large one,

24:35.070 --> 24:36.537
with a lot of employees.

24:36.570 --> 24:38.709
And they sometimes get
into trouble.

24:38.740 --> 24:41.038
I need a firm to look after
their interests and mine.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.230
Help me make the
best financial

24:43.280 --> 24:45.703
and legal decisions.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.571
I pay well.
I pay on time.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.918
And I help those who help me.

24:54.090 --> 24:57.287
You have a DUI involving
the Baja Fund CEO.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.629
I could tell you
things that would

24:59.660 --> 25:01.594
help you
with the arresting officer.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.561
(door closes)

25:11.910 --> 25:13.707
I met your husband once.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.276
Taller than I expected.

25:15.310 --> 25:17.744
Yes, he is tall.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.702
Electronic monitoring's
a bitch, isn't it?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.718
TONY:
They don't validate.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.149
How can they not validate?

25:23.180 --> 25:24.283
They're going to
argue about this,

25:24.320 --> 25:25.719
then they're going
to say "yes."

25:25.750 --> 25:27.854
Maybe.
No. No "maybe."

25:27.890 --> 25:31.587
Money makes things predictable,
so here's your signing bonus:

25:32.630 --> 25:35.849
This Rivers--
I have something.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.629
It isn't the same
as Sheffrin-Marks.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.695
You don't even
believe that.
How's it different?

25:39.730 --> 25:42.563
You know how many kids died
from their asthma medicine?

25:42.600 --> 25:44.238
Oh, my God, the sophistry here
is just blinding.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.261
Sheffrin-Marks has
white employees in suits.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.800
Bishop's crew has
African-American men...

25:47.840 --> 25:49.899
Don't try to sell this
on the back of racism!

25:49.940 --> 25:51.942
Sheffrin-Marks didn't set out
to murder anyone.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.175
Shane Marx, Paul Din,

25:54.220 --> 25:55.915
Johnathan Graham--
all murderers.

25:55.950 --> 25:57.269
Accused murderers.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.083
Now who's the sophist?

25:59.120 --> 26:01.611
We're not in_a court
of law, Diane.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.809
It's just you and me.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.589
We represent murderers.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.756
We get them off.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.758
No. We keep the courts honest.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.155
And why shouldn't the courts
be kept honest about Bishop?

26:10.200 --> 26:11.667
Everybody deserves
representation.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.668
Does that stop suddenly
when it comes to...

26:13.700 --> 26:14.439
A criminal organization

26:14.470 --> 26:16.597
whose sole purpose
is to sell drugs

26:16.640 --> 26:18.699
and to murder
to control territory?

26:18.740 --> 26:21.038
Sure. Put it any way you want,
it's still a true statement.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.071
(sighs)

26:24.880 --> 26:26.700
We're doing this for the money.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.978
Of course we are.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.339
We're not a charity.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.679
We do this or we lay off
half of Acquisitions.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.358
That's ten lawyers
and ten families.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.051
Not to mention
your season tickets.

26:38.390 --> 26:41.188
I'm sorry.

26:41.230 --> 26:44.620
He gave a parting piece
of information about Rivers.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.591
What?

26:45.630 --> 26:48.133
Rivers was sleeping
with Kelli Gerber Smith,

26:48.170 --> 26:49.967
the murdered witness.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.071
Objection, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Overruled.

27:00.110 --> 27:02.317
How's that, Mr. Gardner?
Do you approve of that?

27:02.350 --> 27:03.886
I do. Thank you,
Your Honor.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.945
So, if there are no more
pretrial motions

27:05.990 --> 27:07.651
maybe we can move this along.

27:07.690 --> 27:09.180
Actually, the defense

27:09.220 --> 27:11.120
requests that AUSA Rivers
be disqualified

27:11.160 --> 27:12.855
as prosecution's
representative.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.027
On what grounds?

27:14.060 --> 27:15.857
That's my question, Mr. Rivers.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.221
Yes, Your Honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Gardner?

27:18.270 --> 27:21.865
Your Honor, this is a signed
affidavit from the clerk

27:21.900 --> 27:25.404
at the Lake Avenue Motel
saying that Mr. Rivers

27:25.440 --> 27:27.032
spent the night with
Kelli Gerber Smith

27:27.070 --> 27:29.129
on nine occasions.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.239
Uh...

27:31.280 --> 27:33.441
(stammering, clears throat):
Relevance, Your Honor?

27:33.480 --> 27:35.812
Your Honor,
do I even need to respond?

27:35.850 --> 27:37.442
Is this true,
Counselor?

27:37.480 --> 27:40.040
Uh, Your Honor...

27:40.090 --> 27:42.183
Answer the question, Mr. Rivers.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.950
Yes.

27:44.990 --> 27:48.027
But_I assure Your Honor
that it Will in no way affect

27:48.060 --> 27:50.767
my ability
to prosecute this case.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.222
Motion denied,
Mr. Gardner.

27:52.270 --> 27:53.828
However,

27:53.870 --> 27:56.896
I am reconsidering
the SUV.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.099
How did you find that out?

28:02.140 --> 28:03.744
How? Inside source.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.099
Too bad it didn't
disqualify Rivers.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.971
We didn't want it to.
It undercut the judge's
trust in Rivers

28:08.020 --> 28:10.011
and got her to
kick the SUV.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.482
Cary.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.851
Do you have a second?

28:13.890 --> 28:15.357
Sure. What's up?

28:16.390 --> 28:18.426
Are you tweeting about me?

28:19.460 --> 28:21.155
Am I tweeting about you?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.088
Are you Upriser7?

28:23.130 --> 28:24.495
What are you talking about?

28:24.530 --> 28:27.294
Someone's gossiping
online about me.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.194
And you thought it was me?

28:31.240 --> 28:33.231
Yeah.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.704
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's good
to be working with you, too.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.488
Hello?

28:44.520 --> 28:46.886
ELI:
In here, hon.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.081
How was work?

28:50.120 --> 28:51.326
Where's...?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.827
In the shower.
Kids are in bed.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.088
I let them watch a little TV.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.018
Have you ever seen
When a Stranger Calls?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.298
The movie?

28:59.330 --> 29:02.231
A long time ago.
Hmm.

29:02.270 --> 29:04.135
We just traced
the IP address

29:04.170 --> 29:05.398
for the last anonymous tweet.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.328
And?

29:07.370 --> 29:09.235
It's coming
from inside the house.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.475
No, just a bit of an emergency.

29:13.510 --> 29:16.070
Rivers found another way
to get the SUV in.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.542
Through the GPS.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.014
So I'll need you
to come in. Sorry.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.187
No, it's all right.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.380
Um, I'll probably be
half an hour.

29:22.420 --> 29:23.557
Great. Thanks.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.785
No problem.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.921
Is that Will?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.326
Yes. I have to go back in.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.123
So what do you think?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.296
I don't know.

29:35.070 --> 29:36.958
Maybe one of them is angry.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.809
Either about me
running again or...

29:38.840 --> 29:41.331
Or me at work.
Yeah.

29:41.380 --> 29:45.043
Do you really think
it's possible that our
children would do that?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.048
It's crazy, Peter.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.049
Maybe someone was using our
Wi-Fi without us knowing?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.048
Eli's checking it.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.512
But we still have
to talk to them.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.484
I'll do it.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.283
Tomorrow.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.492
All-nighter?

30:04.530 --> 30:06.259
No, just a few more hours.

30:09.270 --> 30:11.830
I found condoms
in your bedside table.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.578
I was looking for
your letter opener.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.419
I thought maybe they
belonged to Zach.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.315
You know, you found
them in his room.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.318
But then I thought,
you wouldn't take them.

30:25.350 --> 30:28.319
You'd have a sensible
conversation with _him
about responSIbility.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.316
So then, I thought
they were yours.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.555
But that didn't make sense
because you have an IUD.

30:32.590 --> 30:34.899
I had it removed.

30:35.930 --> 30:37.329
Oh, really?

30:37.360 --> 30:38.896
So condoms do make sense?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.363
They do.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.391
For who?

30:52.450 --> 30:54.270
Check it, Peter.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.016
I said I was looking
for your letter opener.
I have other drawers, too.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.039
Did you check these ones?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.183
I said that I was looking...
How about over here?

31:00.220 --> 31:02.654
Did you check this drawer?
What is it you need
to hear from me?

31:02.690 --> 31:04.157
I will never touch_
another woman again.

31:04.190 --> 31:06.454
What do you want,
a prize, Peter?

31:06.490 --> 31:08.321
_It_seems to be _ _
the minimum prereqUISIte.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.918
For both of us.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.467
Then trust me.

31:16.070 --> 31:18.129
Then don't go to work tonight.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.942
(keys jangle)

31:32.990 --> 31:34.981
Trust me.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.389
But the GPS isn't the same
as the SUV in our opinion.

31:44.430 --> 31:45.362
It's contained in the SUV

31:45.400 --> 31:47.459
in my opinion.
RIVERS: But the data is separate

31:47.500 --> 31:49.365
and tracked through
satellite imaging...
Which is only accessed

31:49.400 --> 31:51.334
through the SUV,
which was thrown out!

31:51.370 --> 31:53.338
RIVERS:
Your Honor, the GPS shows

31:53.370 --> 31:55.531
this SUV drove right
from Mr. Dorfman's office

31:55.580 --> 31:57.138
to the site where
the body was dumped

31:57.180 --> 31:58.408
on the night
of the murder.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.406
You have no proof
my client was in the SUV

32:00.450 --> 32:02.111
or at his office at those times!

32:02.150 --> 32:04.311
This isn't_ about Mr. Dorfman
pulling the trigger.

32:04.350 --> 32:05.942
We don't need to prove
that, Your Honor,

32:05.990 --> 32:07.389
in our opinion.
This is about

32:07.420 --> 32:09.411
whether or not he was
compIICIt in the Witness' death.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.486
And the inference is that...
Was the GPS factory installed?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.452
RIVERS:
What? I don't know.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.195
How is that relevant,
Mr. Gardner?

32:16.230 --> 32:19.028
If the GPS was installed
at the factory, it should
be considered

32:19.070 --> 32:22.096
part of the automobile
regardless of whether
or not the tracking

32:22.140 --> 32:23.732
information was pulled
from satellite technology.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.408
RIVERS:
The GPS was manufactured

32:25.440 --> 32:27.203
by Botheon, Incorporated,
Your Honor.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.309
Not General Motors.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.035
A separate
corporate entity

32:30.080 --> 32:31.342
that uses _
separate satellites

32:31.380 --> 32:32.472
that gather information.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.341
Therefore, we should
be able to introduce

32:34.380 --> 32:36.109
this information
into eVIdence.

32:36.150 --> 32:37.378
Overruled, Mr. Gardner.

32:37.420 --> 32:39.445
The GPS data is allowed
into evidence.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.515
ALICIA:
We're still looking for ways
to undercut the GPS,

32:43.560 --> 32:45.380
but we need to know:

32:45.430 --> 32:47.489
Were you at your law office
that night?

32:47.530 --> 32:49.395
The night of the murder? Yes.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.523
CARY:
But you didn't

32:51.570 --> 32:53.595
talk to _or see
any of the Bishop crew?

32:53.630 --> 32:55.598
No.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.437
Then why were they
at your office?

32:57.470 --> 32:59.631
Because this GPS
has them at your office.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.331
I don't know.
They could've been

33:01.380 --> 33:02.369
parked there for all we know.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.469
All "we" know? Who's we?

33:04.510 --> 33:05.704
TAM MY:
We.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.548
Dad and me.

33:08.580 --> 33:09.444
You were there?

33:09.480 --> 33:11.448
Yes.

33:13.490 --> 33:17.449
Okay, we'll try to do
what we can to undercut the GPS.

33:17.490 --> 33:20.323
Thanks.
Mrs. Florrick.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.998
Could you stay a minute?

33:22.830 --> 33:24.718
No, Tammy. We're fine.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.431
(door opens, closes)

33:35.640 --> 33:37.471
Your daughter had

33:37.510 --> 33:40.399
access to the witness list
and she leaked it to Bishop.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.576
Why?

33:42.620 --> 33:44.315
To win the case?

33:45.350 --> 33:47.443
I had a struggling firm.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.412
She wanted to show Bishop
we could handle his business.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.155
And you, you knew?

33:52.460 --> 33:54.599
Well, then that's your defense.
No.

33:54.630 --> 33:57.554
You even think of using her
to free me, and I'll confess.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.329
She's not my client.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.463
I am your client
and I will confess.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.261
Eric, this...
I don't think you understand.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.131
With that information,
Bishop will kill her.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.444
No. He knows if
he moves against her,

34:11.480 --> 34:12.640
I'll tell Rivers everything.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.814
I've got some files socked away,

34:16.850 --> 34:19.182
and attorney-client privilege
be damned.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.450
Then what are you going to do?
Because if I found out

34:21.490 --> 34:22.787
your daughter leaked
the witness list,

34:22.820 --> 34:24.526
Rivers can't be far behind.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.160
Will you take a message
to Bishop for me?

34:44.450 --> 34:46.304
ALICIA:
It's not a big deal.

34:46.350 --> 34:48.375
I won't have a talk.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.547
No scolding, no mothering,
just...

34:50.580 --> 34:52.184
I want to know.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.687
Well, I don't tweet.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.824
Y-you guys think that...?

35:00.390 --> 35:01.550
Mom, this is stupid.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.658
ALICIA:
Don't say "stupid."

35:02.700 --> 35:05.260
There were two
IP addresses used:

35:05.300 --> 35:08.337
the Internet at your school
and here.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.598
I can't believe this.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.789
This is like
a police state.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.262
Don't be melodramatic.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.732
I'm asking you a question.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.806
No, you're not.
You're not saying "no."

35:15.840 --> 35:17.273
Grace, don't.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.200
You didn't do this?

35:20.250 --> 35:21.672
You didn't write these things?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.449
Mom!
What?

35:23.480 --> 35:25.243
Let's at least pretend

35:25.290 --> 35:26.917
we know what happened here
the last six months.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.918
That was different.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.609
We didn't tell you
about the pictures,

35:30.660 --> 35:33.151
because they were
trying to hurt you.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.657
It was a lie, Zach.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.327
And not one.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.669
It was over and over again.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.589
But a lie like
lying about having
Jews in your basement.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.709
You know, like,
with the Nazis.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.435
(sighs)

35:49.480 --> 35:50.629
Let's trust each other again.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.844
My defenses are down.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.314
Let's go. Just tell me.

35:57.350 --> 35:58.647
I told you.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.355
(door closes)

36:05.390 --> 36:06.652
GRACE:
He did it.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.749
That's the way he and Becca
talk all the time.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.637
Uh, not really
how I wanted it to, but...

36:15.670 --> 36:17.695
Yeah, I know
what you mean.
I don't know...

36:17.740 --> 36:19.605
Becca?

36:19.640 --> 36:20.834
She's still in class.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.908
Will you excuse us,
ladies?

36:24.950 --> 36:27.771
It's okay.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.341
(sighs)

36:34.820 --> 36:36.458
Have you got a problem?

36:36.490 --> 36:38.424
That depends, Upriser7?

36:40.430 --> 36:42.489
Oh, so what are you,
like, the Internet police?

36:42.530 --> 36:43.554
No, just an interested

36:43.600 --> 36:46.569
bystander who wants to protect
his six-ﬁgure income.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.397
So, you and Zach talk a lot.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.396
He talks a lot about
his parents, is that it?

36:51.470 --> 36:52.960
Oh, no.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.706
Have I been a bad girl?
No,

36:55.740 --> 36:58.641
dear Becca,
because that would only

36:58.680 --> 37:00.705
make you want to do it again.
(laughs)

37:00.750 --> 37:03.014
You know what you've been?

37:03.050 --> 37:05.541
Gum on the bottom of my shoe.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.855
Spoiled little brat
who will get pregnant at 17,

37:08.890 --> 37:10.619
have an abortion at 18

37:10.660 --> 37:13.424
and meet some sweaty
frat boy over spring break,

37:13.460 --> 37:16.349
and work as a dental hygienist
until the day you die.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.369
And you...

37:19.400 --> 37:20.719
you're a perv.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.738
(laughs)

37:23.770 --> 37:25.362
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

37:26.840 --> 37:29.377
(screams)

37:29.410 --> 37:30.570
(all gasping)

37:33.050 --> 37:35.018
You better get your
story straight, perv.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.580
Oh, Mr. Gold. I'm sorry.

37:41.620 --> 37:42.814
Don't worry, Officer.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.009
Just a daughter
of a friend of mine.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.584
She's all right now.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.621
Aren't you, Becca?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.791
(quietly):
I'm good.

37:55.670 --> 37:56.932
See, I have
a lot of friends,

37:56.970 --> 38:00.838
I'm sure you do, too,
but only difference is,

38:00.870 --> 38:02.929
my friends are not
in homeroom.

38:02.980 --> 38:06.541
So I want you
to listen to me.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.002
Stop tweeting.

38:08.050 --> 38:09.711
If you tweet,

38:09.750 --> 38:11.547
I will know you tweet
and I will...

38:14.050 --> 38:16.848
Have you seen Drag Me to Hell?

38:16.890 --> 38:18.778
It will be just like that.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.821
Do you understand?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.363
I want to hear the words.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.460
I understand.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.866
Good. And enjoy high school.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.505
It really is the best time
of your life.

38:36.540 --> 38:38.542
(elevator bell dings)

38:42.080 --> 38:43.570
This way, gentlemen.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.781
My name is Tony Gurstelle,
and I am guilty

38:45.820 --> 38:47.845
of the murder of Kelli Gerber...
WILL:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

38:47.890 --> 38:50.552
He's surrendering
himself freely!
Get out of my way!

38:50.590 --> 38:53.423
I acted alone and with no
consultation from anybody else.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.724
I had no access
to the witness list

38:55.760 --> 38:58.058
or any other information
other than my own.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.898
I don't have anything
further to add...

39:00.930 --> 39:03.660
What kind of deal
did you make?
You got your murderer.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.930
Come on, what kind of deal
did you make with Bishop?

39:05.970 --> 39:08.404
Do you expect an answer? Really?

39:08.440 --> 39:10.704
What kind of deals
do you make every day?

39:10.740 --> 39:12.401
With drug dealers, killers?

39:12.450 --> 39:15.840
I am in pursuit of the good.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.142
You're in pursuit
of your own sanctity.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.817
Take your suspect.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.954
He killed your girlfriend.

39:22.990 --> 39:24.981
You won.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.726
You wake up with
fleas, Counselor.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.458
You pay your rent,

39:31.500 --> 39:34.628
you go to your restaurants,

39:34.670 --> 39:37.434
but you still
wake up with fleas.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.669
I'm firing you.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.915
No reflection
on your work.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.657
I just feel more comfortable
with Dorfman.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.817
And keeping the evidence
he has on you secret?

39:57.860 --> 39:58.656
Well, that doesn't hurt.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.681
Good work on his defense,
by the way.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.721
WILL:
Good work on your deal.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.921
Dorfman keeps everything
he knows under wraps

40:04.970 --> 40:06.892
and you turn over the murderer.

40:06.930 --> 40:10.388
Well, we only ended up there
because of your defense.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.777
Look, we can work with Dorfman
and share your business.

40:14.810 --> 40:16.072
No, thanks.

40:16.110 --> 40:17.771
I need an up-and-comer.

40:17.810 --> 40:18.879
Someone who's hungry.

40:18.910 --> 40:21.708
You don't think we're hungry?

40:21.750 --> 40:23.843
Not like Dorfman.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.882
Guy's a mountain climber.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.911
Sorry it didn't work out.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.027
(Diane laughing)

40:39.070 --> 40:41.959
So, I'm pitching our firm
to this drug dealer.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.592
(laughing)

40:43.640 --> 40:46.063
I'm telling him we'll validate
for parking again.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.829
(both laughing)

40:49.880 --> 40:51.848
They don't teach you that
at law school.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.074
And he said, no.

40:53.110 --> 40:55.874
(laughing)

40:55.920 --> 40:57.069
(sighs)

40:57.120 --> 40:59.247
He said he looked
at our financials

40:59.290 --> 41:01.611
and he thinks we
have a year left.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.651
(laughing)

41:09.860 --> 41:11.498
So what are we going to do?

41:11.530 --> 41:12.861
I don't know.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.788
Lay off Acquisitions?

41:14.840 --> 41:15.932
Or split up.

41:15.970 --> 41:18.029
Do you want that?

41:18.070 --> 41:19.560
It's an option.

41:19.610 --> 41:22.101
I take my people,
you take yours.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.571
Or we could shop
for another drug dealer.

41:25.610 --> 41:27.009
(both laughing)

41:28.750 --> 41:31.116
Hey, they're the only ones
making money these days.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.051
Or find a third partner.

41:39.590 --> 41:40.727
How does that work?

41:40.760 --> 41:42.022
Find a replacement
for Stem.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.618
Bring him in as equal partner.

41:43.660 --> 41:47.061
Somebody with a client list,
some equity.

41:47.100 --> 41:48.590
You're okay with
giving up a third?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.892
Of what, a sinking ship?

41:50.940 --> 41:52.908
Sure.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.204
We'll kill each other
if we don't find a referee.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.004
A third partner?

41:58.040 --> 42:00.099
Someone neutral,
someone we both agree on?

42:08.150 --> 42:10.983
An optimism
fills the void.

42:11.020 --> 42:13.227
I think that's alcohol.
Just as good.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.251
(both laugh)

42:18.000 --> 42:19.991
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

42:24.840 --> 42:26.831
You sure?
Yeah.

42:26.870 --> 42:29.873
Come on. Let's go
before I change my mind.

42:29.910 --> 42:31.605
Just wait.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.901
Come on. Let's go.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.076
Just one second.

42:34.110 --> 42:35.611
I need to get
something of mine.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.782
(siren wails in distance)

43:08.950 --> 43:10.918
