<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Number 83 on my list...</i>

00:04.060 --> 00:07.290
<i>was "Never took the time</i>
<i>to teach Randy how to blow a bubble. "</i>

00:09.000 --> 00:11.360
- That was closer.
- This is impossible.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.370
Come on now. I know you can do this.

00:13.470 --> 00:16.400
I've seen you do it once before. Remember when
you were dating that Camdenite girl?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.700
Whatever happened with that Camdenite girl?

00:18.810 --> 00:21.300
I thought you two were gonna be a item.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.580
I accidentally killed her.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.410
- <i>[Bell Rings]</i>
- <i>[Man] Order up.</i>

00:28.520 --> 00:30.420
Oh. Okay.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.180
That's uh-That's cool, I guess.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.020
I'm kidding.
She is dead though. Terrible car wreck.

00:40.130 --> 00:41.890
They never did find her head.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.930
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.500
I'm just kiddin'.

00:51.610 --> 00:54.900
- We just broke up. She's in truck driving school.
- Randy, you never told me that.

00:55.010 --> 00:56.910
You just told me the car wreck thing.

00:57.010 --> 01:00.240
I've been thinking she was dead and headless
for the last five months.

01:00.350 --> 01:03.780
Yeah, sometimes I like to let my jokes age
like a fine wine.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.550
Did Uncle Roger really get killed
by a bear last year?

01:09.660 --> 01:11.560
Wait for it.

01:11.660 --> 01:14.220
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

01:19.130 --> 01:21.400
That was better.
You didn't fall off your stool this time.

01:22.870 --> 01:25.070
Now, you go stand and face the claw machine...

01:25.170 --> 01:27.770
and think about what you've done.

01:32.610 --> 01:35.080
- What was that all about?
- Blatant disrespect.

01:35.180 --> 01:37.910
I specifically told that boy
to stay away from Eugenia's daughter Tiffany...

01:38.020 --> 01:41.110
and I come home from getting a mole burned
to find the two of them...

01:41.220 --> 01:44.120
sitting on top of the Andersons' old fridge,
holding hands.

01:44.220 --> 01:47.250
Oh, come on, Joy.
He's got a girlfriend. That's sweet.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.990
No son of mine is gonna date
something that fell out of Eugenia's devil chute.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.120
That woman is evil. If there is a Lord above...

01:53.230 --> 01:56.460
he'll sucker punch her with double eye cancer.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.130
We have reason to believe
Eugenia's been stealing our Valu-Paks.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.400
<i>[Spits, Groans]</i>

02:01.510 --> 02:03.140
What if I want my closets remodeled?

02:03.240 --> 02:07.010
Custom blinds,
air duct cleaning, concrete resurfacing?

02:07.110 --> 02:09.170
Hell, we might want to take
the family to the dentist.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.150
Do you know how expensive
that is without a coupon?

02:13.450 --> 02:14.920
Damn it!

02:15.020 --> 02:17.050
Who gave him a taco?

02:17.160 --> 02:19.490
There are no tacos in time-out!

02:19.590 --> 02:22.360
I feel bad for Dodge.

02:22.460 --> 02:25.590
It's probably for the best. That little girl...

02:25.700 --> 02:27.670
will just break his heart anyway.

02:27.770 --> 02:31.030
Build him up full of hope
with her sweet little smile...

02:31.140 --> 02:33.070
and pretty little eyes...

02:33.170 --> 02:35.570
and then pull the rug of love
out from under him...

02:35.680 --> 02:41.210
send him crashing to the floor
with nothing to catch him but the cold, cold world.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.450
Bitches. Little 10-year-old bitches.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.620
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Randy was a little bitter.</i>

02:46.720 --> 02:50.350
<i>His first love wasn't as great</i>
<i>as the '80s power ballads made it out to be.</i>

02:50.460 --> 02:52.290
<i>One summer, as punishment...</i>

02:52.390 --> 02:55.660
<i>our parents sent us to the lake</i>

02:55.760 --> 02:59.990
Boys, when you're finished with my laundry,
I need you to get in here.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.030
I feel a rash creepin' on.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.700
<i>I need one of you boys to hold up my back skin...</i>

03:04.810 --> 03:07.500
while the other one
gives me a good once-over with the fan.

03:07.610 --> 03:09.870
I call the fan.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.640
<i>[Earl Narrating] After we finished our chores,</i>
<i>we went out and spent our allowance.</i>

03:15.750 --> 03:18.550
<i>Unfortunately, Aunt Gail paid us in rocks.</i>

03:21.590 --> 03:23.990
<i>Randy was a master at skipping rocks.</i>

03:26.660 --> 03:29.090
<i>And I stunk at it.</i>

03:29.200 --> 03:31.390
<i>[Ducks Quacking]</i>

03:31.500 --> 03:33.490
My cousin wanted me to bring you this note.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.500
Oh, sweet.
She must have noticed I'm growing out my 'stache.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.570
It's for the Skipper.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.660

04:49.110 --> 04:51.300
She says she's gonna
let me kiss her tonight on the bridge.

04:51.410 --> 04:54.350
I'm gonna try and go under
the shirt and over the bra.

04:54.450 --> 04:57.010
I bet she stuffs her bra
with some really nice tissue.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.050
<i>[Earl Narrating] Randy waited on the bridge</i>
<i>for three hours that night...</i>

05:00.150 --> 05:02.120
<i>but Pinky never showed up.</i>

05:21.010 --> 05:24.100
I looked for her for the rest of the summer,
but she was gone.

05:24.210 --> 05:26.110
I never saw her again.

05:26.210 --> 05:28.700
You know, you should look Pinky up,
find out what happened to her.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.550
Can we, Earl? Can we find Pinky?

05:31.650 --> 05:34.820
That was 20 years ago.
You don't even know her real name.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.320
So what? Remember that guy I found sleeping
in the back of the El Camino the other morning?

05:39.430 --> 05:41.790
I didn't know his name, and he was easy to find.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.490
Randy, it's a bad idea.
It'll end badly. I know it.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.530
But knowing something's
gonna end badly has never stopped us before-

05:47.630 --> 05:49.970
like driving with our feet
or drinking an entire fish aquarium.

05:50.070 --> 05:52.100
- Randy-
- Earl...

05:52.210 --> 05:54.300
Pinky was the only girl who ever loved me.

05:54.410 --> 05:57.840
Now, it might be crazy, but Darnell's right.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.640
I should try and find her. Please?

06:03.650 --> 06:05.910
Fine.

<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>It only took us 45 minutes to get to the lake...</i>

06:08.790 --> 06:11.760
<i>but it felt like three hours,</i>
<i>'cause Randy changed the lyrics...</i>

<i>of every song on the radio</i>
<i>to "Pinky, Pinky, Pinky, Pinky."</i>

06:19.730 --> 06:22.070
Boy, that's a long time ago.

06:22.170 --> 06:26.110
In 1984, I could lift both arms over my head.

Anyway, her-her name was Pinky,
and she called me Skipper.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.520
We rented a boat here once.
She used her father's credit card.

06:44.620 --> 06:50.030
Well, I guess I can check the old receipts for you,
see if I can find somethin'.

06:50.130 --> 06:52.830
Oh, and she had pink hair.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.620
I've got your best pair of underwear on...

07:18.730 --> 07:21.290
and we're gonna find my first love again.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.730
Randy, that old guy's
been looking through receipts for six hours.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.490
Just promise me you won't get your hopes up.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.730
Even if we find her, which I doubt...

07:29.840 --> 07:31.930
she could be married or not even remember you.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.060
I won't get my hopes up.

07:34.170 --> 07:37.010
But I'm sure we'll find her,
and of course she's gonna remember me.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.170
And if she's married, she'll get a divorce...

07:39.280 --> 07:43.580
so we can move to Connecticut and live together
in a little yellow house on Maple Street...

07:43.680 --> 07:46.520
with our three children, Brett, Tyler and Lizzy.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.590
How's that not gettin' your hopes up?

07:49.690 --> 07:52.120
Lizzy has cerebral palsy, Earl.

07:54.190 --> 07:56.820
- Well, I found her.
- Seriously?

07:56.930 --> 08:00.630
Yeah. Uh, it took a few phone calls...

08:00.730 --> 08:03.200
but I got ahold of her a few hours ago.

08:03.300 --> 08:06.200
I told her a guy named... Skipper...

08:06.310 --> 08:09.640
was looking for her, and she got all excited.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.040
She remembers me. Earl, she remembers me.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.310
- I heard, Randy.
- Oh, yeah. She- She's on her way.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.710
Said she could be up here around 4:00...

08:18.820 --> 08:24.050

to meet her on the bridge.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.360
What did she sound like?

08:40.470 --> 08:46.140
Oh, she sounded like a real ride on the "A" train.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.510
Not that I could do anything about it now.

How could you do that? She was my first love.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.850
<i>Love? Please.</i>

12:16.960 --> 12:19.750
<i>It was chilly on the lake,</i>

12:21.390 --> 12:24.190
- Randy-
- Don't. Don't.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.320
It was 20 years ago. L-I was a kid.

12:27.430 --> 12:30.890
I had to hold Aunt Gail's back fat all by myself.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.700
- It was slippery. I needed you!
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:42.710
- Can I have a ride?
- Whatever.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.220
So I've been dreaming about
kissing Randy all these years?

12:46.320 --> 12:49.650
Now I'm questioning my taste in everything.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.160
Like, is Darnell really hot?

12:52.260 --> 12:54.520
Are Christians really the best?

12:54.630 --> 12:56.990
Maybe I don't even like Sinbad.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.400
Oh, God. I feel sick.
[Groans]

13:10.410 --> 13:13.610
- What are you doin'?
- I'm not sleeping next to you anymore.

13:13.710 --> 13:17.670
And good luck cutting your own toenails
and clipping your own nose hairs from now on too.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.280
[Laughs] I can't wait to have
a front row seat to that train wreck.

13:21.390 --> 13:23.620
Come on, Randy. You're being crazy.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.990
Oh, oh, oh. You think I'm crazy?

13:26.090 --> 13:28.030
[Laughs]
I'll show you crazy.

13:28.130 --> 13:31.460
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy!
Brother. Remember, you're my brother.

Same mom.
I'm the only one who knows how to write a check.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.140
I've read your list, Earl. Sometimes I take it...

13:38.240 --> 13:40.830
in the bathroom when there are no comics,
and this isn't on it.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.430
Now, why would you spend so much time trying to
teach me how to blow a stupid bubble...

13:44.540 --> 13:46.210
when you could have been making up for this?

13:46.310 --> 13:49.010
Because I was too ashamed to put it on the list.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.110
B-But look. It's on here now.

13:51.220 --> 13:54.240
Number 277- broke up Randy and Pinky.

13:54.350 --> 13:57.220
And I'm not gonna do another list item
until I make up for this.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.790
Look.

14:00.890 --> 14:04.230
Let's figure this out. How can I make this right?

14:04.330 --> 14:06.700
I wanna make out with Pinky.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.860
Randy, you can't really want to make out with Joy.
She's horrible to you.

14:10.970 --> 14:15.500
You took away my opportunity to share a kiss
with the one girl that ever loved me.

14:15.610 --> 14:19.010
Now, I know on the outsideJoy looks mean,
and on the inside she is mean...

14:19.110 --> 14:21.270
but somewhere inside that is Pinky.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.580
And I wanna touch that part
of her with my tongue.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.910
Now, if you want to cross me off your list,
you need to make it happen.

14:29.490 --> 14:31.390
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Getting Joy to make out with Randy...</i>

14:31.490 --> 14:33.720

14:34.890 --> 14:37.160
<i>But out of respect, before I even asked her...</i>

14:37.260 --> 14:39.730
<i>the first thing I had to do</i>
<i>was get permission from Darnell.</i>

14:39.830 --> 14:42.230
It's fine with me.
Skipper was part ofJoy's prenup.

14:48.710 --> 14:51.870
Oh, my God. Yes. Yes.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.610
Yes!

14:53.710 --> 14:56.880
I will spend the rest of my life with you,
Darnell Turner.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.510
Okay. Let's figure out our freebies.
Mine's my first love. Guy named Skipper.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.880
- What's a freebie?
- We each get to pick one person...

15:01.990 --> 15:04.080
we can still have sex with if we get the chance.

15:04.190 --> 15:07.280
And anything goes. You don't even have to use
a condom if you don't want to.

15:07.390 --> 15:11.300
Oh, my God. We're getting married!

15:12.570 --> 15:15.130
I still can't believe her freebie is Randy.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.430
Makes me feel better about
picking Anna Nicole Smith.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.060
Yeah, she got pretty fat, didn't she?

15:21.170 --> 15:24.080
- She's dead.
- No.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.410
She's dead, man.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.410
Come on. You're-You're kiddin'.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.880
You're trying to get me back for me and Randy
messing with you about the Camdenite girl.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.320
I'm not kidding.
She's dead. Couple years now.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.220
Wow.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.650
To Anna Nicole. One of the good ones.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.060
Damn straight.

<i>[Earl Narrating] With Darnell's permission,</i>
<i>I was clear to try and seal the deal.</i>

15:52.340 --> 15:54.310
You gotta be outta your mind.

Come on, Joy. It's just one kiss.

15:57.210 --> 15:59.180
What's the big deal? Darnell's cool with it.

15:59.280 --> 16:03.680

16:15.230 --> 16:18.130
he can't hang out with Eugenia's daughter,
the more time he spends with her.

16:18.230 --> 16:20.130
Of course he's not gonna listen to you.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.130
No kid takes dating advice from their parents.

Fine. You break up my son

- Hey, Randy.

Skipper.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.820
So, I thought we'd start
with a little orange soda-

17:51.920 --> 17:53.860
your favorite, if I remember correctly.

17:53.960 --> 17:58.120
Then I thought we'd listen to a little Bobby Brown.
Also your favorite, if memory serves.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.130
And I thought we could play tic-tac-toe.

18:00.230 --> 18:03.230
I believe our record stands
at Pinky, 87, Skipper, zero.

Randy, it's been 20 years.

<i>I traded in orange soda</i>
<i>for strawberry wine when I was 13...</i>

18:08.370 --> 18:11.810

he started picking doody out of Whitney Houston.

- It's called mouthwash.
- I know what mouthwash is.

We used to drink it

That's not mouthwash.

18:27.690 --> 18:31.090
Nope. It's rubbing alcohol,
bleach and green food coloring.

I didn't think Scope alone
would kill whatever lives inside...
