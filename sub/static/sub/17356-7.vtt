00:07.508 --> 00:10.509
- ¶

00:10.511 --> 00:16.315
- Okay, "a" plus "b" equals...
"c" ya later, homework!

00:17.451 --> 00:19.451
- Good day, m'lady.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.052
- Gideon.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.720
If you're coming over
to talk about dating me

00:21.722 --> 00:24.223
or my mother,
please move along.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.225
- Goodbye, m'lady.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.194
- Oh, look, you're doing
the math homework.

00:29.196 --> 00:29.962
- [phone camera clicks]

00:29.964 --> 00:32.331
- It's nice to have
my own personal nerd.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.333
- Max, stuff like that
makes me wonder

00:34.335 --> 00:36.468
if you're really over
your evil phase.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.471
- Allison, I've told
you a hundred times.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.339
Why can't you trust me?

00:40.341 --> 00:42.474
- 'Cause you were the only
ten-time cover model

00:42.476 --> 00:44.643
of "Evil Teen" magazine?

00:45.780 --> 00:47.212
- Look, I've changed.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.181
I am no longer evil.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.151
And I was on that
cover 11 times.

00:53.387 --> 00:57.289
- Hey, you guys.
We have an announcement.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.757
Oyster asked me out.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.459
We're a couple!

01:00.461 --> 01:01.627
- Cue the screams.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.129
- OTHERS:
[screaming]

01:05.099 --> 01:05.731
- Really, dude?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.333
- What? Why should
I hide my jewelry?

01:09.070 --> 01:12.304
- I'm so happy for you guys.
Come, sit!

01:13.607 --> 01:15.407
Whoa!
- [heavy thud]

01:15.409 --> 01:16.775
- Oops.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.110
- Ow, heh-heh.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.411
Guess these booths
are kinda small.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.480
Um, no worries.
I'll go grab a chair.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.649
- CHERRY: Should we tell them
the best part about our dating?

01:23.651 --> 01:25.784
- OYSTER: Oh, you tell 'em.
- CHERRY: No, you tell 'em.

01:25.786 --> 01:29.254
- Okay, the best part is
our new name is Choyster!

01:29.256 --> 01:33.125
Get it? I matched "Cherry"
and "Oyster" together.

01:35.129 --> 01:39.098
- Way better than mine--
Cheroystererry.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.268
- Hey, if you guys
are Choyster, that makes us...

01:43.270 --> 01:45.637
Mallison!
- MAX: Oh?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.808
- We should totally
double-date some time.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.777
- What are you guys
doing tomorrow night?

01:51.779 --> 01:54.680
- CHERRY, OYSTER, MAX, ALLISON:
[chattering]

01:54.682 --> 01:55.581
- Would you look
at the time.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.684
Um, it's half-past
I don't belong here anymore.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.384
Uh...

01:59.386 --> 02:04.223
so, I'll just, uh, excuse myself
before this gets awkward.

02:04.692 --> 02:08.360
- OTHERS:
[continue chattering]

02:10.431 --> 02:14.500
- ¶

02:14.502 --> 02:17.603
- Okay, here's another
doggie, Chloe.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.173
- This dog is
missing a leg.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.509
- It's way better
than my worm.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.911
- You're holding
it upside down.

02:25.913 --> 02:30.249
- Oh, now I see it.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.585
- Kids, your cousin Blobbin
is coming over for dinner.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.320
It's time to get ready.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.823
Honey, are you still
upset about your friends?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.191
- It's gotten
even worse, Mom.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.160
They entered a doubles
tennis tournament

02:41.162 --> 02:42.828
on tandem bikes
and then rode them

02:42.830 --> 02:46.398
to get double-scoop
ice cream. Look.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.000
- I've seen those.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.336
I follow Choyster
and Mallison on Chirper.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.640
- Now my options are to either
miss out on everything,

02:54.642 --> 02:56.842
or tag along and be
a fifth wheel.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.442
- Yeah.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.311
- I mean, literally,
I tried to catch up

02:59.313 --> 03:01.180
with them on a unicycle.

03:01.415 --> 03:05.317
- I know. I also follow
Unicycle Fails on Chirper.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.319
Honey, you're gonna be fine.

03:07.321 --> 03:11.623
Just take the time to
focus on yourself and...

03:11.625 --> 03:13.625
whatever this is.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.228
- Or...

03:16.230 --> 03:20.599
I'll focus on making
a balloon boyfriend.

03:20.601 --> 03:26.338
Choyster, Mallison,
prepare to meet...

03:26.340 --> 03:28.574
Ballonbe!

03:28.576 --> 03:31.243
Hey, I'm actually getting
pretty good at this.

03:31.245 --> 03:35.380
"You sure are, Phoebe.
I'd never ditch you."

03:35.549 --> 03:38.617
What? I wasn't
doing anything weird!

03:39.587 --> 03:40.786
What have you guys
been up to?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.621
- Oh, we just went
couples' beekeeping.

03:42.623 --> 03:46.458
- We collected honey
with our honeys.

03:46.794 --> 03:50.262
- Bae, make me the luckiest
broseph in the world

03:50.264 --> 03:53.232
and take a photo of me at
the Heart Tree tomorrow.

03:53.234 --> 03:56.401
- Yes, I will, Choyster!

03:56.971 --> 03:59.838
- No, Choyster is
a mixture of the bo...

03:59.840 --> 04:01.373
Never mind.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.408
- Oyster, you're so sweet.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.445
Hey, Max, how come
we've never done that?

04:06.447 --> 04:08.814
- Because I used
to be evil.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.515
- What's your excuse now?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.451
- I just don't wanna.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.286
- You will go
if you wanna prove to me

04:14.288 --> 04:15.654
that you're not
evil anymore.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.023
Or we can go to
the Break-up Tree.

04:18.025 --> 04:18.957
- Is that real?

04:18.959 --> 04:19.958
- You wanna find out?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.694
- Heart Tree,
here we come.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.830
- Oh, sweetcious!

04:24.832 --> 04:25.998
But we've gotta be ready.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.568
Crazy Farmer Ted doesn't like
kids trespassing on his farm

04:29.570 --> 04:30.669
to get to the Heart Tree.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.905
So, he booby-trapped
the whole place.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.441
- Rumor has it,
if he catches you,

04:36.443 --> 04:39.311
he'll feed you to
his man-eating pigs.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.912
[oinking]

04:41.081 --> 04:43.582
- Wow! Friends, fun,
and the possibility

04:43.584 --> 04:46.051
of Max being eaten by
a man-eating pig?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.486
I am in!

04:47.488 --> 04:50.322
- You're coming to
the Heart Tree? With who?

04:50.324 --> 04:53.425
- Phoebe, do you
have a new bae?

04:53.427 --> 04:57.362
- I mean, yeah.
- Oh, not more screams.

04:57.364 --> 05:01.366
- OTHERS: [screaming]

05:01.368 --> 05:04.736
- I can't wait to meet him.
- PHOEBE: Ha. Ha.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.805
Me, neither.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.508
- ¶

05:09.510 --> 05:10.609
¶ What you see ¶

05:10.611 --> 05:11.810
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:11.812 --> 05:15.480
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:15.482 --> 05:16.948
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:16.950 --> 05:18.383
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:18.385 --> 05:19.918
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:19.920 --> 05:21.620
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:21.622 --> 05:23.488
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:23.490 --> 05:25.457
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:25.459 --> 05:26.758
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:26.760 --> 05:28.493
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:28.495 --> 05:30.362
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

05:30.364 --> 05:31.797
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:31.799 --> 05:32.898
¶ Just your average family ¶

05:32.900 --> 05:36.535
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

05:36.537 --> 05:40.806
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

05:43.777 --> 05:44.543
- ¶

05:44.545 --> 05:47.112
- ...and when I woke up,
we were somewhere over Guam.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.080
[laughing]

05:48.082 --> 05:51.683
That's the last time I let
my dog fly my helicopter.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.784
[laughs]

05:52.786 --> 05:55.854
- It's even funnier
the fifth time you tell it.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.690
- Speaking of time,
I bet you need to get going.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.058
- Oh, yeah, we know how
you trillionaires

06:00.060 --> 06:02.794
have other places to be
that aren't here.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.530
- Actually, I have
nowhere to be.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.198
- HANK:
Oh...

06:06.200 --> 06:09.067
- I'm out. My baby
has to go night-night.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.236
- Oh, she's so cute, Chloe.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.237
May I see her?

06:12.239 --> 06:15.741
Oh, I bet she has
a nice little bed,

06:15.743 --> 06:17.976
with a nice, big dollhouse.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.613
And a nice roof over
her pretty little head.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.848
[sobbing]

06:22.850 --> 06:24.282
- Uh, are you okay,
Blobbin?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.852
- [sobbing]
No, I'm not okay!

06:27.254 --> 06:29.688
I lost all my money.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.455
- How?
- What happened?

06:30.457 --> 06:33.225
- I wanted to fit my entire
fortune into my wallet.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.762
So, I cashed everything
for a trillion dollar bill.

06:36.764 --> 06:40.098
But then I lost my wallet.
[sobbing]

06:40.100 --> 06:44.269
I have no money
and nowhere to go.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.904
Unless I can stay here?

06:45.906 --> 06:49.040
- Ho, ho, I don't think
that's a great idea.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.642
- [sobbing]

06:50.644 --> 06:54.079
- Okay, okay, you can
stay in the yard.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.047
- [sobbing loudly]

06:56.049 --> 06:57.716
- The garage.
- [sobbing loudly]

06:57.718 --> 06:59.117
- All right, fine,
the house.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.154
- Okay, but only
because you begged.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.224
- Speaking of begging...
[laughing]

07:06.794 --> 07:09.361
Doggin, they said
we can stay!

07:11.832 --> 07:16.268
- Great! Now we have two
houseguests that slobber.

07:17.171 --> 07:21.239
- ¶

07:21.241 --> 07:23.008
- You know, I've always
felt we had,

07:23.010 --> 07:25.076
like, a special
connection.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.112
- I move here yesterday.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.648
- It was an instant
connection.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.285
So, uh, are you gonna go
to the Heart Tree with me?

07:33.287 --> 07:36.288
- Crazy Farmer Ted's
Heart Tree?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.391
- Coward!

07:40.127 --> 07:43.795
- Hey, Phoebe, that guy who
ran away from you in fear--

07:43.797 --> 07:47.232
that's your new boyfriend?
[laughing]

07:47.401 --> 07:50.635
Please don't tell Allison
I was mean to you.

07:52.406 --> 07:56.041
- Hey, Micah.
You, me, Heart Tree?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.075
- No!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.177
I wanna live!

08:00.347 --> 08:02.113
- Dang it. Isn't there one
boy in this school

08:02.115 --> 08:05.884
who's desperate enough to risk
his life for a date with me?

08:05.886 --> 08:07.819
- Good day, m'lady.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.423
- Good day, m'Gideon.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.826
- ¶

08:14.828 --> 08:17.329
- Blobbin is the worst
houseguest in the world.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.330
He keeps ruining our stuff.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.333
- We had to replace our
toothbrushes, robes,

08:21.335 --> 08:23.034
Nora's beach ball and--

08:23.036 --> 08:24.102
- What'd he do to
my beach ball?

08:24.104 --> 08:27.339
- [laughing]
Oooh, you do not wanna know.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.342
- So what if Blobbin
messes up our stuff

08:30.344 --> 08:32.377
and Doggin farts a lot.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.746
- So many farts.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.315
- I'm with Billy.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.117
Blobbin's not that bad.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.386
- [high-energy
music playing]

08:41.388 --> 08:44.990
- What a great Blob-kwon-do
workout, right, Doggin?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.391
- [Doggin barks]

08:46.393 --> 08:48.994
- [martial arts shouting]

08:48.996 --> 08:51.029
Ah!
- [glass shatters]

08:51.031 --> 08:52.364
- [barking]

08:54.167 --> 08:57.435
- He killed our TV.
He's gotta go.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.005
- Nora's right. It's time
to ask him to leave.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.975
- You're making a mistake,
knuckleheads.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.244
- What are you doing
out here, Colosso?

09:06.246 --> 09:09.481
- Who do you think
fertilizes your flowers?

09:10.017 --> 09:13.852
Now, listen, you're all about
to fail the rich guy test.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.786
- What test?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.754
- Blobbin's not broke.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.923
He wants to see if you'd
still care about him,

09:17.925 --> 09:18.757
even if he had no money.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.227
And if you pass, he'll
share his riches with you.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.762
- The rich guy test.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.730
I saw it in
a cartoon once.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.765
His story checks out.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.201
- It did seem weird that he
cashed in all his money

09:30.203 --> 09:32.037
for a trillion dollar bill.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.872
- If Colosso's right
about this,

09:33.874 --> 09:35.173
then we could
buy a new TV.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.409
- Nora, Blobbin's
a trillionaire.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.744
We could buy two TVs.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.515
- Show me the money, baby!

09:44.051 --> 09:45.483
- Okay, let's get in there

09:45.485 --> 09:48.853
and show Blobbin
how much we love him.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.427
- I'm not sure
how this happened.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.797
- That's fine, Blobbin.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.132
Give us a hug!
- Okay!

10:01.134 --> 10:03.268
- [object shatters]

10:03.537 --> 10:05.537
- BARB: Ohhhh...
- NORA: Oh!

10:05.539 --> 10:08.206
- PHOEBE:
[laughs]

10:08.208 --> 10:10.508
Max, what ya doin'?

10:10.510 --> 10:13.445
- I'm gonna use these night
vision goggles to scope out

10:13.447 --> 10:16.915
booby-traps and lead us
safely to the Heart Tree.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.184
- [garbage can clattering]

10:21.355 --> 10:24.456
- Technically,
that was not a booby-trap.

10:24.925 --> 10:29.494
- Phoebe, when's your
new bae getting here?

10:29.496 --> 10:31.463
- Howdy, boo!

10:33.100 --> 10:34.099
- OTHERS:
Gideon?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.001
- Yep, I recently realized

10:36.003 --> 10:37.869
that Gideon would
do anything for me,

10:37.871 --> 10:42.173
and that's the kinda guy that
I really, really needed.

10:42.876 --> 10:47.045
- Oh, my gosh,
you're Gidephoebedeon.

10:47.547 --> 10:52.117
- That's right and we're gonna
have the best night ever.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.518
Achoo!

10:53.520 --> 10:56.388
My sinuses are exploding!

10:57.391 --> 11:00.225
- He's even more
pitiful in night vision.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.861
- I've gotta say--for
a booby-trapped farm,

11:02.863 --> 11:05.263
owned by a deranged old man,
this isn't so bad.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.534
- It's what you don't see
that should scare you.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.339
Duck!
- OTHERS: [gasping]

11:16.476 --> 11:18.043
- See? I told you
I've changed.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.613
The evil Max would let you all
take a tire to the face.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.282
Follow me.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.950
- [owl hooting]

11:25.952 --> 11:27.919
- Look at all of us
hanging out together,

11:27.921 --> 11:32.023
just us couples,
a nice even number of wheels.

11:32.025 --> 11:36.561
- Actually, I think your wheel's
lookin' a little wobbly.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.229
- [groaning]

11:39.199 --> 11:40.899
- I'm sure he's fine.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.901
- Help me, boo!

11:43.136 --> 11:47.972
- Go ahead, Gidephoebedeon
will catch up with you guys.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.109
- Dude, why didn't you tell me
you were allergic to everything?

11:51.111 --> 11:54.045
- I wanted to be mysterious.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.949
- You can do it. Put one foot
in front of the other and--

11:57.951 --> 12:00.885
- [rope whipping]

12:03.023 --> 12:06.057
- --get caught in a booby-trap.
[blows hair]

12:06.059 --> 12:07.559
- The good news
is I'm so scared,

12:07.561 --> 12:08.593
my allergies have
cleared up.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.930
- Awesome. That means you'll
be nice and snot-free...

12:11.932 --> 12:14.299
when the pigs eat us!

12:20.006 --> 12:22.040
- Oh, we've gotta find a way
to get off this fence,

12:22.042 --> 12:25.610
and catch up with everybody
before Farmer Ted finds us.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.681
Hey, is that a possum?
- I hope not. I'm allergic.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.683
- [blowing frosty air]

12:32.252 --> 12:37.689
- Besides, the only beady-eyed
creature I wanna look at is you.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.125
- Thanks?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.794
- Okay, I may not be
smooth with my words,

12:42.796 --> 12:45.497
but I am smooth
with my beats.

12:45.499 --> 12:49.534
[beatboxing,
sputtering]

12:49.703 --> 12:52.437
- Why did I pop
my balloon boyfriend?

12:54.508 --> 12:56.608
- [owl hooting]

12:56.610 --> 13:01.212
- MAX: All right,
there's the Heart Tree.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.147
- It's amazing.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.215
- This'll be way better
than the selfie

13:04.217 --> 13:06.084
we took at Butt Creek.

13:06.253 --> 13:10.221
- You know, they really
shouldn't let people swim there.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.058
- Let's do this.
- [quiet click]

13:14.060 --> 13:17.095
- ALLISON: [gasps]
- OYSTER: Oh!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.329
- Thanks, Max.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.331
- I'd never let a lady
get hit with cow poop.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.067
[laughs] Hey,
maybe it hit Phoebe.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.335
Phoebe?

13:24.337 --> 13:26.738
- She went back a while
ago to help Gideon.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.740
She said they
would catch up.

13:28.742 --> 13:29.607
- Huh.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.775
Something's not right.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.711
- I know. That cow
poop was humongous.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.581
What are they feeding
these things?

13:36.750 --> 13:39.517
- No, I mean Phoebe
should be here by now.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.386
I've gotta go back.
I'm worried about her.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.421
- Really? A minute ago,
you were hoping

13:43.423 --> 13:46.524
she got hit with
a flying turd.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.394
- 'Cause that's funny.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.497
- Okay, it is kinda funny.
- MAX: [laughs]

13:52.499 --> 13:53.298
- But it's also evil,

13:53.300 --> 13:55.400
like pretending you wanna
take a Heart Tree selfie,

13:55.402 --> 13:56.801
and then bailing
at the last second.

13:56.803 --> 14:00.271
- Okay, fine. Follow me
and you'll see I'm right.

14:00.273 --> 14:05.276
Plus, I am the only one who
knows how to get outta here.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.645
- [garbage can clattering]

14:07.814 --> 14:11.482
- Why don't these things
see garbage cans?!

14:12.819 --> 14:17.355
- ¶

14:18.425 --> 14:20.692
- Time to get rid
of these bunions.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.262
[lasers zapping]
- BLOBBIN: [laughing]

14:24.431 --> 14:26.731
- I got your favorite--
jelly beans!

14:26.733 --> 14:28.433
- Oh, yay!
[clapping hands]

14:28.435 --> 14:30.435
Jelly beans!
[chomping]

14:30.437 --> 14:31.836
I don't wanna
seem ungrateful,

14:31.838 --> 14:34.439
but why are you guys
being so nice to me?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.174
- Money.
- HANK: [laughing]

14:36.176 --> 14:40.578
What he means is we feel bad
that you lost all your money.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.579
- Not that it
matters to us

14:41.581 --> 14:44.716
because we love you
whether or not you're rich.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.551
- BLOBBIN:
Oh...

14:46.853 --> 14:48.820
- That goes double
for me, ma dawg.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.723
Dogs share everything.
Am I right?

14:51.725 --> 14:54.759
- [Doggin farts]
- Ugh!

14:54.761 --> 14:57.161
Smells like roses.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.164
- I'm just glad you're
not annoyed with me

15:00.166 --> 15:02.467
for overstaying my welcome...
[laughing]

15:02.469 --> 15:06.304
and for what I did
to your car.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.474
- That's fine, Blobbin.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.744
- We just wanna do
what makes you happy.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.847
- So, you'll do
anything I ask?

15:15.849 --> 15:17.215
- ALL:
Anything.

15:17.217 --> 15:22.487
- Well, in that case,
how about some nice, relaxing...

15:22.489 --> 15:25.590
Blob-kwon-do!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.358
Looking good, fam.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.559
Five, six, seven, eight...

15:28.561 --> 15:30.461
kick and shimmy
and punch and--

15:30.463 --> 15:33.598
- [heavy thud]
- BARB: [screaming]

15:35.335 --> 15:36.801
- I'm okay.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.671
Still love you, Blobbin.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.909
- Chicka, chicka, chicka!
[fluttering lips]

15:46.579 --> 15:48.212
- Now to spit
some romantic rhymes.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.882
- Dude, I think you've
spit enough for one night.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.954
- Aha! I knew you guys
got yourselves trapped.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.990
- Max, you came back for us.
- We're saved, boo.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.627
Some day we'll tell this
story to our little "Giddies."

16:03.897 --> 16:06.898
- ALLISON: Max, get those
dimples back here!

16:08.702 --> 16:11.636
Oh, they are in trouble.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.673
- That's right and you
didn't believe me.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.875
Bet you feel pretty silly.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.544
- [lever clicks]

16:19.546 --> 16:20.912
- CHERRY:
[gasps]

16:22.682 --> 16:24.816
- [heavy thud]

16:24.818 --> 16:27.285
- Now we all feel
pretty silly.

16:27.287 --> 16:27.986
- Okay, don't panic.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.954
We just need to get
out of here before--

16:29.956 --> 16:32.557
- [pigs oinking]

16:32.792 --> 16:38.463
- And cue terrified screams.
- [screaming]

16:38.999 --> 16:40.798
- And three and four
and chop, chop, chop!

16:40.800 --> 16:42.533
Three and four and chop,
chop, chop!

16:42.535 --> 16:45.970
Feel that burn,
you guys?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.841
- I can't feel anything.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.976
- My bad.
[laughs]

16:51.978 --> 16:55.813
Sometimes I "pop"
when I should "shimmy."

16:56.583 --> 16:57.548
- But I have
something special

16:57.550 --> 17:01.786
that's gonna make you
feel like a million bucks.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.554
- I bet it's
a million bucks.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.858
- Yes, we passed
the rich guy test.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.961
- You're welcome, dummies.

17:10.930 --> 17:11.929
- You know,
when I first got rich,

17:11.931 --> 17:14.465
it was hard to tell if people
were being nice to me

17:14.467 --> 17:16.000
just 'cause they
wanted money.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.735
But I know you're
being nice to me

17:17.737 --> 17:19.303
because you truly love me.

17:19.305 --> 17:24.842
Oh, you truly, truly,
truly, truly love me.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.444
Truly.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.782
- Why does almost being
rich feel so terrible?

17:30.784 --> 17:32.483
- Because we're awful people.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.320
And, plus, we probably
have internal injuries.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.322
- To show my appreciation,

17:38.324 --> 17:40.425
I would like to
present you with--

17:40.427 --> 17:42.560
- Blobbin, wait!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.562
We have to tell
you the truth.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.464
- Don't you do it!

17:46.466 --> 17:47.665
- We only did
those sweet things

17:47.667 --> 17:50.501
because we thought
you'd give us money.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.336
- You did it.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.673
- We should have been nice
because you're family,

17:55.675 --> 17:56.908
not because you're rich.

17:56.910 --> 17:57.842
- But I'm not rich.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.077
I told you,
I lost my wallet

17:59.079 --> 18:00.945
with a trillion dollar
bill inside.

18:00.947 --> 18:04.015
- Then what were you
about to give us?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.484
- I fixed your
family portrait.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.552
- BARB:
Oh.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.021
- So, there's no such thing
as a rich guy test?

18:10.023 --> 18:13.925
- I let that dog give me
a tongue bath for nothin'?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.626
[growling]

18:16.863 --> 18:18.796
- We're sorry, Blobbin.

18:18.798 --> 18:23.434
- Oh, lucky for you my other
superpower is forgiveness.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.369
I still love you guys.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.637
- Oh, we love you, too.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.672
- And even if you
did have money,

18:27.674 --> 18:30.942
we'd never ever even
consider taking it.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.810
- [Doggin barfs]
- [object splats]

18:32.812 --> 18:34.979
- [Doggin woofs]

18:34.981 --> 18:37.615
- Cool, Doggin barfed.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.951
- My wallet!

18:39.953 --> 18:43.387
[gasps]
Doggin, you ate it.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.424
- [gasps]
- Your trillion dollar bill!

18:46.426 --> 18:50.428
Blobbin, you're rich again.
- Oh, I totally am!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.029
But don't worry,
I'll honor your wish

18:52.031 --> 18:55.933
and never ever give
you a dime of my money.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.470
- That's fine, Blobbin.
Right, Hank?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.538
- [sobbing]
Yeah.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.108
These are tears of joy.
[sobbing]

19:05.712 --> 19:09.981
- ¶

19:09.983 --> 19:10.615
- [pigs oinking]

19:10.617 --> 19:13.151
- Guys, it was my allergies
that led to this.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.687
When the pigs come,
let them eat me first.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.122
- Cool.
- Works for me.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.091
- Sounds good.
- You got it.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.426
- With any luck,
they'll choke on my bones

19:22.428 --> 19:24.095
and spare my beloved Phoebe.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.698
Your only crime was
falling for a bad boy.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.735
- All right, Gideon...

19:30.737 --> 19:34.172
I may have actually committed
a few other crimes tonight.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.873
I only pretended
I wanted to date you,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.042
so I could come out
with these guys tonight.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.844
- What?
- I know, I know, it's horrible.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.847
I just...I didn't
wanna be a fifth wheel.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.715
I really missed hanging
out with my friends.

19:44.717 --> 19:49.520
- Aw, Phoebe, we didn't even
realize we were leaving you out.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.988
- I did.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.059
- You were taking advantage
of my feelings?

19:55.061 --> 19:55.927
Well, that's okay,

19:55.929 --> 19:58.763
'cause I was taking
advantage of yours, too.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.330
- Excuse me?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.165
- I was only dating
you to get close to--

20:01.167 --> 20:04.702
- Don't you dare!
- --your mom.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.337
- Barb is so--

20:06.339 --> 20:09.173
- We're gonna stop
talking immediately.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.875
- [pigs oinking]

20:10.877 --> 20:14.178
- Oh, no, here comes Farmer Ted
and his man-eating pigs!

20:14.180 --> 20:17.949
- [pigs oinking]
- [corn rustling]

20:17.951 --> 20:19.884
- Hey, kids!

20:20.920 --> 20:23.487
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry
I was a stinker

20:23.489 --> 20:25.790
and caught you up
in my booby-traps.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.892
Couples who come take
pictures of the Heart Tree

20:27.894 --> 20:30.561
never stop and say hi.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.963
Hi!!!

20:32.699 --> 20:33.231
- ALL: Hi.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.534
- Ooh, doggies, now that's
what I'm talkin' about.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.203
- Wait, so you're not gonna feed
us to your man-eating pigs?

20:39.205 --> 20:41.205
- Oh, heck, no.
I don't even have any pigs.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.709
No, just some cows
on a high-fiber diet.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.045
- That explains the poop.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.947
- But we heard pigs.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.848
- Yeah. No, that was me.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.184
Yeah, I do enjoy
doing pig impressions.

20:53.186 --> 20:54.619
[clears throat]

20:54.621 --> 20:56.220
[oinking, snorting]

20:56.222 --> 20:56.954
[laughing]

20:56.956 --> 20:59.290
See, that there, that was
a Wisconsin pot-belly.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.093
- Oh, that is so impressive.
Can you do teacup pigs?

21:02.095 --> 21:02.927
- Oh, sure, sure.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.897
Now the trick is to be real
teeny with your voice.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.966
- Hey, pig pal,
can we wrap this up?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.067
- Right. Sorry.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.671
Um, Farmer Ted, could you
free me and my friends?

21:13.673 --> 21:17.041
- And her mom's
future boyfriend?

21:18.011 --> 21:20.077
- You can free him last.

21:21.547 --> 21:27.118
- ¶

21:27.120 --> 21:28.185
- [phone camera clicks]

21:28.187 --> 21:31.022
- There you go.
Proof I am no longer evil.

21:31.024 --> 21:34.258
- I knew you weren't evil
the moment you helped Phoebe.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.894
You actually seemed
concerned for her.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.331
- I know.
It's a new feeling.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.333
I hope it goes away.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.735
Let's head back.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.737
- [metal clanks]

21:47.140 --> 21:48.606
- Oh, no, we're trapped.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.940
Why would he put
one out here?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.943
- [laughing] Couples
who come to the Heart Tree

21:52.945 --> 21:54.879
never stop and say bye.

21:54.881 --> 21:55.880
Bye!!!

21:55.882 --> 21:58.115
Oh, ho.
[laughing]

21:59.886 --> 22:01.585
[continues laughing]

22:01.587 --> 22:04.121
- BOTH:
Bye?

22:04.123 --> 22:08.059

22:10.730 --> 22:26.711
