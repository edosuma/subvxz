WEBVTT

00:03.097 --> 00:05.866
No. So I... all... When I was
growing up, I thought pea meant

00:05.900 --> 00:08.302
please pass the salt so
I... But there's no salt,

00:08.336 --> 00:10.304
so then my mother's like,
yeah, the S is shut up,

00:10.338 --> 00:12.873
so I never got salt anyway.
Thank you very much, Michelle.

00:12.907 --> 00:14.942
Oh, now this is a
cheeseburger! Look at this!

00:14.976 --> 00:16.910
- Am I right?
- It's a nice sports bar.

00:16.945 --> 00:18.912
Sports bar? Oh no, my friend.

00:18.947 --> 00:21.414
This is no mere sports
bar. This is a "gastropub,"

00:21.449 --> 00:23.383
all right? This is an
establishment where fine cuisine

00:23.417 --> 00:27.587
and top flight libations merge
in a feast for the senses.

00:27.655 --> 00:29.255
- It's cool.
- Sure.

00:29.289 --> 00:31.391
- Cocktails are amazing, right?
- Speaking of which,

00:31.425 --> 00:33.326
see this? This is Jason right here.

00:33.361 --> 00:36.896
He was voted the top concoctor
of all things alcoholic

00:36.964 --> 00:41.468
- 2 years in a row.
- I love it, Oz. Really. I do.

00:41.502 --> 00:44.604
Hey. Hold on here. What are you guys up to?

00:44.672 --> 00:46.639
- You guys are acting funny.
- Funny?

00:46.674 --> 00:48.908
Why do you care about this
Jason guy and the drinks?

00:48.976 --> 00:53.145
Why do I care? Because...

00:53.213 --> 00:55.314
- OK, just tell them.
- I bought the place!

00:55.382 --> 00:57.083
- What?
- Ha! Ha! Right?

00:57.150 --> 00:59.485
I mean, I didn't buy...
I bought into the place,

00:59.552 --> 01:01.653
not the whole... It's my
cousin's place. You know,

01:01.688 --> 01:03.655
he's a great chef, top of
his class at culinary school,

01:03.723 --> 01:05.657
but he's not really into
the business side of it

01:05.725 --> 01:08.594
- so that's where I come in.
- Sandy, you're good with this?

01:08.661 --> 01:11.063
Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?

01:11.131 --> 01:13.266
- What about your hospital job?
- I'll do both.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.901
- You'll do both?
- Yeah, it's what I said.

01:14.968 --> 01:17.236
- You said you'll do both.
- Not worried about me, are you?

01:17.304 --> 01:19.305
- No, no.
- Oh, I see. You're worried

01:19.373 --> 01:22.073
that I'm gonna not have enough
time for you, is that it?

01:22.141 --> 01:24.842
Look at the little crinkle
in his wolf blue eyes.

01:24.911 --> 01:27.379
He's afraid he'll be looooonely.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.414
- Oh, my gosh!
- Looooonely!

01:29.448 --> 01:31.950
No, no, no. I'm not worried about me, Oz.

01:32.018 --> 01:34.319
The two of you, I mean you
barely see each other as it is

01:34.353 --> 01:36.288
and how are you gonna make this work?

01:36.322 --> 01:38.290
Oh, it's gonna work out
just fine. Am I right?

01:38.324 --> 01:40.758
Of course. Where there's
a will, there's a way.

01:40.793 --> 01:43.128
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

01:43.195 --> 01:46.164
- Cheers to you, my friend!
- And cheers to you!

01:46.198 --> 01:49.166
What's your forecast
for the future, Alphonse?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.135
The Titans are playing hot. We're in shape.

01:51.202 --> 01:53.065
Our heads are good.

01:53.091 --> 01:54.972
So, you're feeling good about
the quarterfinals on Monday?

01:55.006 --> 01:56.974
Well, this is one of the biggest games

01:57.008 --> 01:58.943
in university football
and we're ready for it.

01:58.977 --> 02:01.045
I gotta give a lot of
credit to our defense.

02:01.112 --> 02:03.004
They've really been bringing it all season.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.007
And as long as we don't
lose that momentum...

02:05.050 --> 02:07.318
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey,
hey! They've got me, right?

02:07.352 --> 02:11.221
Huh? So we don't have to
worry about losing momentum.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.789
Ha! Ha!

02:12.824 --> 02:14.658
We won't lose against the Dragons.

02:14.692 --> 02:16.526
Thanks, Alphonse. We're
all cheering for you.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.362
- Good luck on Monday.
- Thank you.

02:18.396 --> 02:21.231
OK, feed's down.

02:21.299 --> 02:24.368
What? You got a problem?

02:24.402 --> 02:26.303
No, no, no, no.

02:26.338 --> 02:28.839
- Do you got a problem?
- Come on, man.

Stop! Move! Move back!

No, it... it's the bottle on the shelf,

03:01.337 --> 03:04.839
not in the door. They're
dated for a reason, OK?

03:04.874 --> 03:06.908
You just need to look at the schedule.

03:06.942 --> 03:09.010
I know. I'm sorry.

03:09.044 --> 03:11.846
Of course, you can handle it.

03:11.881 --> 03:15.516
OK, you too. Yeah. Bye.

03:17.552 --> 03:18.952
Hey!

03:18.987 --> 03:22.189
Mmm. Hey.

03:22.257 --> 03:24.024
So? Any news?

03:24.058 --> 03:26.159
I was gonna ask you guys the same thing.

03:26.227 --> 03:28.428
No. I mean, they've gotta
make a decision soon, right?

03:28.462 --> 03:30.430
Klein's been gone a month.

03:30.464 --> 03:33.033
Klein wrote you an amazing
recommendation. Job is yours.

03:33.101 --> 03:35.903
Yeah. From what I hear, they interviewed,
like, 10 top-notch candidates.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.705
- A mere formality.
- Well, until we hear otherwise,

03:38.773 --> 03:41.641
I guess it's, what, business as usual.

03:44.979 --> 03:47.246
- Thanks a lot.
- Becker?

03:47.281 --> 03:49.449
Brian Becker.

03:49.483 --> 03:52.285
Until recently, I was an
inspector at the Metro Major

03:52.352 --> 03:54.954
Crimes Unit. Superintendent
Parker wanted to come down and

03:55.022 --> 03:59.392
do this himself but I figured
I'd save him the hassle.

03:59.460 --> 04:02.495
I'm the new head of the unit.

04:05.198 --> 04:08.635
From Metro to IIB, that...
that's quite a promotion.

04:08.702 --> 04:11.905
Well, I'm quite a cop.

04:11.972 --> 04:15.007
Sergeant McCluskey.
You've got a lot of fans.

04:15.075 --> 04:16.517
I'm looking forward to working with you.

04:16.543 --> 04:18.336
Corporal Clark, I've heard
great things about you.

04:18.378 --> 04:20.846
Looking forward to it too. And Toby Logan,

04:20.914 --> 04:23.749
well, you've come a long way, huh?

04:23.817 --> 04:26.852
From freelance face reader to
Special Consultant at the IIB.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.989
You two know each other?

04:30.023 --> 04:31.991
You got the wrong idea about me.

04:32.059 --> 04:33.926
What I got is my own
agenda and you're on it.

04:33.961 --> 04:35.995
You set one foot inside my department,

04:36.063 --> 04:37.896
I swear to God...

04:37.965 --> 04:40.333
I'll snap your scrawny little neck.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.734
Yeah, we, uh...

04:42.769 --> 04:44.670
Well, I, uh...

04:44.737 --> 04:47.373
helped out a partner of his at Metro.

04:47.441 --> 04:49.236
Who'd have guessed we'd
be working together, huh?

04:49.262 --> 04:51.310
Not me.

04:51.345 --> 04:54.279
- I guess we should, uh... give you the tour.
- Yeah.

04:54.313 --> 04:56.514
Maybe in a bit. We got a case!

04:56.548 --> 04:59.684
Last night, 200,000

04:59.718 --> 05:03.321
in US bills, it fell out of the
ceiling in the Titans' locker room.

05:03.389 --> 05:06.124
No prints, no leads as
of yet. Here, take a look.

05:06.158 --> 05:08.994
- That's college ball, right?
- Yeah.

05:09.061 --> 05:11.629
Interesting, but not something
the IIB usually handles.

05:11.663 --> 05:14.499
Well, what if I told you that that money
was taken out of the Metro evidence lockup?

05:14.533 --> 05:16.667
That could put every case
- pending trial in jeopardy.

05:16.702 --> 05:18.835
Think it's an IIB-worthy case now?

05:18.870 --> 05:21.138
That money was marked.

05:21.172 --> 05:25.075
It was originally confiscated during a high
profile drug bust. Los Sangres drug cartel.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.411
- That was a big bust.
- Go to trial next week.

05:27.479 --> 05:29.413
Metro is losing their minds
because if this gets out,

05:29.447 --> 05:31.581
every single criminal who's
waiting for a court date is

05:31.616 --> 05:34.918
- gonna be gunning for a mistrial.
- So this is not only damaging,

05:34.952 --> 05:37.121
it could potentially be
extremely embarrassing as well.

05:37.155 --> 05:39.123
We got a gag order on the press.

05:39.157 --> 05:41.091
God knows this is gonna come out.

05:41.126 --> 05:43.060
When did Metro realize
that this was missing?

05:43.094 --> 05:46.030
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
If that money hadn't fallen out

05:46.064 --> 05:48.297
of the ceiling in the Titans' locker room,

05:48.332 --> 05:50.233
no one ever would have known
that it was missing. Thank you.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.101
Well, we'll get on it right away.

05:52.136 --> 05:54.237
Great. McCluskey, with me.
We'll do the evidence lockup.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.407
Corporal Clark, Logan, I want you
to take the dressing room. Thank you.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.576
Actually, Toby and I usually
go out in the field together.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.511
Klein would stay here

06:01.546 --> 06:04.781
- and just hold down the fort.
- Klein was a lawyer, I'm a cop.

06:04.815 --> 06:07.651
I don't hold down forts. Hey!

06:09.620 --> 06:12.188
- Catch up.
- How's Toby supposed

06:12.222 --> 06:14.456
to use his power when we've got Mr. Metro,

06:14.490 --> 06:17.026
"I don't hold down forts" golden
boy watching our every move?

06:17.060 --> 06:20.195
I can't believe this is happening.
You should've gotten the job, Michelle.

06:20.229 --> 06:22.097
Ah, everything happens for a reason.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.199
What's the history between you two?

06:24.267 --> 06:27.202
It's a long story. Fill you in later.

06:39.782 --> 06:41.915
According to the computer...

06:41.917 --> 06:42.816
that money's just where
it's supposed to be.

06:42.884 --> 06:44.986
Logged in to the system

06:45.053 --> 06:47.021
and sitting on shelf 115,

06:47.089 --> 06:49.556
but instead of cash...

06:49.624 --> 06:52.693
it's filled with cell
phones and electronics.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.363
Do you guys have
surveillance cameras in here?

06:55.430 --> 06:58.299
Yeah. There and there.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.501
We're gonna need to see those recordings.

07:00.568 --> 07:01.995
How far back?

07:02.021 --> 07:03.229
Everything since the money
was logged into evidence.

07:03.271 --> 07:06.072
I also want polygraphs for every
clerk who worked during that time.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.408
You think one of my guys
stole from the lockup?

07:08.476 --> 07:10.410
- You're crazy.
- Money didn't walk away,

07:10.478 --> 07:12.646
sunshine. Get me their
names and schedules, please.

07:12.714 --> 07:14.481
How do you normally process the evidence?

07:14.549 --> 07:16.449
Well, through the pick-up windows.

07:16.518 --> 07:18.886
That one's for civilians
picking up items that have been

07:18.920 --> 07:21.855
cleared for release.
The other one's for cops

07:21.923 --> 07:23.824
picking up evidence to convey to a trial.

07:23.892 --> 07:25.792
How do you keep track of all these boxes?

07:25.827 --> 07:28.896
Well, every box has a tracking number.
It's scanned in and out of the system with

07:28.963 --> 07:31.431
- officer's badge number and name.
- So the only way it could

07:31.465 --> 07:34.100
get out of here is if a
police officer authorizes it.

07:34.135 --> 07:37.237
- That's right!
- No, it's not a police problem.

07:37.304 --> 07:39.339
These clerks...

07:39.373 --> 07:42.608
they're all civilians. Our best
bet is one of them just took it.

07:42.676 --> 07:46.179
We're also gonna need all the logs. I
wanna know everyone who came in here,

07:46.213 --> 07:49.115
what they signed out, what they
signed in, everything you got.

07:49.150 --> 07:51.751
- Mm-hmm.
- Becker.

07:51.818 --> 07:54.554
Theresa.

07:54.588 --> 07:56.956
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.858
- How ya holding up?
- Great.

07:59.926 --> 08:02.727
Detective Theresa De Souza... Thank you.

08:02.762 --> 08:04.729
Meet Sergeant Michelle McCluskey.

08:04.797 --> 08:07.533
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.
- Theresa was a supervising

08:07.567 --> 08:10.469
- officer on the Sangres bust.
- I can't believe this is happening

08:10.503 --> 08:14.639
My whole case is in jeopardy. Yeah, I got
a confession, but the money disappearing

08:14.674 --> 08:17.008
has broken the chain of evidence.

08:17.043 --> 08:21.146
- Their lawyers are gonna rip into me hard.
- This has to be an inside job.

08:21.181 --> 08:23.747
We should look into janitorial
and maintenance staff.

08:23.782 --> 08:25.816
All those folks had
access to the lockup too.

08:25.850 --> 08:28.319
Wouldn't be impossible
for Los Sangres to fake

08:28.345 --> 08:29.620
a background check and get a mole in here.

08:29.654 --> 08:31.655
- OK. Will do.
- Thanks.

08:31.690 --> 08:34.158
Yeah.

08:34.193 --> 08:37.828
- That should be all of it.
- Thank you.

08:37.861 --> 08:40.097
We're gonna need a work-up
of every single clerk

08:40.131 --> 08:42.400
in the department, looking
for connections to Los Sangres.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.335
We should get Toby on this.
He can be really helpful

08:44.369 --> 08:46.270
when we're questioning potential
suspects. It helps us bypass

08:46.305 --> 08:48.239
- a bunch of unnecessary work.
- If one of these clerks

08:48.273 --> 08:50.575
is involved, we don't need a face reader,

08:50.609 --> 08:55.078
we need background checks.
But I appreciate the input.

08:57.348 --> 09:00.217
So who steals money from a police lockup

09:00.251 --> 09:02.785
only to hide it inside
a football locker room?

09:02.820 --> 09:04.787
If it came from the Los Sangres case,

09:04.855 --> 09:06.823
could they be crazy enough
to try to steal it back?

09:06.857 --> 09:09.926
Well, maybe one of the players
is linked to the Los Sangres.

09:09.994 --> 09:12.129
Thanks.

09:12.163 --> 09:14.931
Hey. I'm Dan Cuddy. I'm
the trainer for the Titans.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.767
Dan, we've got a few questions
for you about the money.

09:17.801 --> 09:20.035
- Yeah.
- Have any of your players

09:20.103 --> 09:22.004
been known to have substance abuse issues?

09:22.071 --> 09:23.972
Of course not. No. These
guys are smarter than that.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.376
They'd lose their scholarships,
get kicked out of school, no.

09:27.410 --> 09:30.579
JJ's clean now.

09:30.614 --> 09:33.715
What about JJ? Is he still using?

09:33.750 --> 09:36.918
Look, guys, I'm bound by
that confidentiality clause,

09:36.953 --> 09:39.488
so I can't... I can't say anything.

09:39.556 --> 09:41.290
Who has access to the locker room?

09:41.324 --> 09:43.592
Uh, well, the team alone, that's like 40,

09:43.660 --> 09:47.296
and, uh, then there's the team
trainers, team doctors, reporters.

09:47.364 --> 09:51.232
Heck, even the marching band comes in
here so it's, like, at least a hundred.

09:51.267 --> 09:54.670
OK. I'm gonna need the video
surveillance for the facility.

09:54.704 --> 09:57.238
Well, there's no cameras in
the locker room. Privacy issues.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.575
But there is a camera
just outside the entrance.

10:00.643 --> 10:04.146
OK. That'll do. That'll let me know
who came in and out of the locker room.

10:08.835 --> 10:11.236
Corporal, where are we with the lockup?

10:11.303 --> 10:13.138
I checked the clerks, cleaning
staff and court officers,

10:13.206 --> 10:15.039
but so far there's nothing suspicious.

10:15.107 --> 10:17.241
- What about the dressing room?
- I'm going through the footage

10:17.308 --> 10:20.811
trying to identify everyone who entered with
a bag big enough to hold that amount of cash

10:20.879 --> 10:23.748
and checking the entire period since
the money was booked into the lockup.

10:23.815 --> 10:25.582
Once you got the list to
get names together, just

10:25.650 --> 10:27.985
start working. How about the
money? Was that all recovered?

10:28.053 --> 10:30.420
All but 1500 of the 200K.

10:30.488 --> 10:32.456
It was a free-for-all
when the money fell.

10:32.523 --> 10:34.558
Maybe one of the players grabbed the cash.

10:34.626 --> 10:37.928
All the TV cameras kept rolling. Anything
that fell from the ceiling was recovered.

10:37.963 --> 10:40.131
So the 1500 was taken
before the money was stashed.

10:40.165 --> 10:42.332
We find the money,
hopefully we find our guy.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.334
We've got a lead on JJ Jones.

10:44.369 --> 10:46.603
He's the running back. He
was brought in 2 years ago

10:46.638 --> 10:49.038
on scholarship but he
missed a semester last year,

10:49.073 --> 10:50.974
because he was on the disabled list.

10:51.008 --> 10:53.143
The truth is that he was in rehab

10:53.210 --> 10:55.779
for a drug addiction. But
random drug testing shows

10:55.846 --> 10:57.781
that he's been clean ever
since he started back at school.

10:57.848 --> 11:00.617
However, he still has a
reputation as being a party boy.

11:00.652 --> 11:02.686
He's been known to hang out
at a club called Remney's,

11:02.754 --> 11:05.255
which happens to be a haven
for Los Sangres members.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.458
OK. Good work, Corporal.

11:08.493 --> 11:12.862
- Let's bring him in. McCluskey?
- Yeah.

11:22.673 --> 11:25.441
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:31.581 --> 11:34.350
- I know it must be tough.
- What's that?

11:34.384 --> 11:36.786
Having a family, demanding job.

11:36.820 --> 11:39.655
What are you trying to say?

11:39.690 --> 11:42.123
Nothing.

11:44.092 --> 11:46.628
Look. Yes, you are our new boss,

11:46.662 --> 11:48.630
but you're joining our unit,

11:48.664 --> 11:51.666
and we have our routines
and our procedures,

11:51.701 --> 11:54.202
and it's worked for us.
Our, our record proves it.

11:54.236 --> 11:56.304
So if you come in here
and you start messing

11:56.339 --> 11:59.073
with the way we operate, it
is going to affect our results.

12:01.877 --> 12:03.978
I have issues with Toby Logan

12:05.681 --> 12:08.550
- That doesn't concern you.
- If you have an issue with

12:08.584 --> 12:10.552
one of us, you have an issue
with all of us. We're a team.

12:10.586 --> 12:13.221
I am well aware of that. Thank you.

12:13.255 --> 12:16.691
So what's your problem with Toby?

12:16.726 --> 12:19.660
He got one of my best detectives killed.

12:21.596 --> 12:23.731
She trusted him and it cost her.

12:23.765 --> 12:26.300
- Charlie.
- He told you?

12:26.368 --> 12:29.203
- Yeah, we're a team.
- Well, Charlie was my team,

12:29.238 --> 12:31.472
and he got her killed.

12:36.278 --> 12:38.246
There's our guy.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.814
Let's go.

12:43.118 --> 12:45.753
- Sure. Yeah. No problem.
- JJ Jones!

12:45.820 --> 12:49.656
A little busy, man.

12:49.724 --> 12:51.558
Hello, gorgeous.

12:51.593 --> 12:53.960
Hello back.

12:54.028 --> 12:56.363
OK, what's the problem?

12:56.431 --> 12:59.466
- I've been clean all semester.
- We're not the drug squad, JJ,

12:59.501 --> 13:01.435
we're the IIB and you need to come with us.

13:01.469 --> 13:03.637
- You can't take me away.
- Actually, we can.

13:03.671 --> 13:05.787
You missed your last
parole meeting. Let's go.

13:05.813 --> 13:07.565
Yeah but I didn't do anything.

13:07.608 --> 13:10.743
That's what we're gonna find out. Let's go.

13:13.107 --> 13:15.275
Where did you get the money, JJ?

13:15.343 --> 13:17.311
Hmm?

13:17.378 --> 13:19.746
Who took it out of the evidence
lockup? Who you working for?

13:19.814 --> 13:22.082
I don't have a job.

13:22.150 --> 13:24.851
I'm in school and I'm the
running back for the Titans.

13:24.919 --> 13:26.986
What's your connection to Los
Sangres? You're dealing for 'em?

13:27.054 --> 13:29.322
- The drug cartel?
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.389 --> 13:32.559
Do you think I'm crazy? I
got a death wish or something?

13:32.593 --> 13:36.128
Is this a game you want to play? Really?

13:36.196 --> 13:38.498
It's fine by me 'cause,
you know, we got all night.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.668
Don't you have a playoff curfew?
They don't take that stuff

13:42.702 --> 13:46.072
- lightly, do they?
- Yeah.

13:46.106 --> 13:48.274
If you're willing
to get suspended from playing

13:48.342 --> 13:50.876
in that quarterfinal
game, well, that's, uh...

13:50.944 --> 13:54.646
I... I can't get anything. He's
not asking the right questions.

13:54.714 --> 13:56.882
Well, we'll figure it out,
right? We'll work around him.

13:56.916 --> 14:00.686
- You should be running this unit, Michelle.
- It's fine, OK? I'm a big girl.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.990
Of all the people, for him
to walk in and to take over...

14:07.327 --> 14:09.362
He talked to me about Charlie.

14:09.429 --> 14:12.898
Toby, get out of here!

14:12.932 --> 14:15.300
Charlie! Charlie, stay with me.

14:17.303 --> 14:21.172
Yeah, well, whatever he said,

14:21.240 --> 14:23.774
he was right. I let that
guy get the drop on her.

14:23.809 --> 14:25.843
- I should have seen it coming.
- There's nothing

14:25.911 --> 14:28.213
you could have done, Toby.
That guy was a trained killer.

14:28.247 --> 14:31.416
Well, this guy is never gonna believe it.

14:31.484 --> 14:33.518
You know you've been photographed

14:33.552 --> 14:35.520
with known associates
of Los Sangres, right?

14:35.554 --> 14:37.688
I get my picture taken with
a lot of people I don't know.

14:37.723 --> 14:39.590
When did you put the
money in the ceiling, JJ?

14:39.625 --> 14:41.592
I didn't...

14:41.627 --> 14:44.429
You're looking at the wrong guy, man.

14:44.463 --> 14:46.431
You know, I think he knows who hid

14:46.465 --> 14:48.726
the money, but Becker's
never gonna go there.

14:48.752 --> 14:50.225
Let me see what I can do.

14:56.408 --> 14:59.109
Someone hid that money, JJ.

14:59.144 --> 15:01.278
I don't think you did it,

15:01.312 --> 15:03.713
but I do think you know who did.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.917
I may not like everybody on my team...

15:06.951 --> 15:09.520
but I ain't no snitch.

15:17.362 --> 15:19.796
JJ's coming off clean.
He suspects who did it,

15:19.830 --> 15:21.864
but he's not gonna rat on one
of his teammates. He's loyal.

15:21.898 --> 15:24.133
- So you read who's responsible?
- Alphonse Reid.

15:24.201 --> 15:26.135
- The quarterback?
- That's right. He saw Alphonse

15:26.203 --> 15:28.171
in the locking room
alone looking suspicious.

15:28.205 --> 15:30.173
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- What about Becker?

15:30.207 --> 15:32.241
We can't tell him we're
working off one of my reads.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.343
So we don't.

15:38.482 --> 15:41.517
That can't be right.

15:41.552 --> 15:43.619
You ever look at numbers and
they make no sense to you?

15:43.687 --> 15:46.288
Hey! Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

15:46.389 --> 15:49.224
Hey. Yeah. Um, I just wanted
to come by before my shift

15:49.258 --> 15:52.027
and get some accounting done here.
Jason, can you give us a second, please?

15:52.095 --> 15:54.429
- Thanks.
- Well...

15:54.497 --> 15:58.200
You know, they don't pay their suppliers,
they're 3 weeks behind on wait staff wages.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.235
And you want to talk
about working to a budget?

16:00.269 --> 16:02.705
They might as well be heating
the pizza oven by burning money.

16:02.772 --> 16:05.808
Wow! They are
very lucky to have you here.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.943
- Well, we'll see.
- Um...

16:09.011 --> 16:10.945
Are you OK?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.915
You just, you sounded
all stressed on the phone.

16:13.983 --> 16:16.417
Yeah, yeah. I just, um...

16:16.485 --> 16:19.621
- I did want to talk to you about something.
- OK.

16:24.059 --> 16:26.861
Look, my life's been kind of in a bit

16:26.929 --> 16:29.463
of upheaval lately, right?
I mean, between this place

16:29.498 --> 16:31.699
and just trying to take control of my life,

16:31.734 --> 16:33.701
and I was thinking

16:33.769 --> 16:37.438
we could take our relationship to the...

16:37.506 --> 16:41.842
next level, you know... what I mean?

16:43.778 --> 16:47.314
- I don't, I don't know if I do.
- Well, I just, I thought maybe we could,

16:47.382 --> 16:49.983
you know, take control
of this relationship,

16:50.051 --> 16:52.253
you know, move it to the next plateau,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.321
- the next stratus, the next echelon.
- Oz, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:54.356 --> 16:57.391
OK. Just... What, what are you asking here?

16:57.459 --> 17:01.094
Well, Sandy, uh... will you...

17:01.163 --> 17:03.764
- I don't know...
- move in with me?

17:03.831 --> 17:05.932
- What?
- Oh, thank gosh!

17:05.967 --> 17:08.202
You don't know what? What?

17:08.270 --> 17:10.170
Oh, I thought...

17:10.237 --> 17:12.405
I just, I thought you were...

17:12.473 --> 17:14.574
I thought you were gonna pop the question.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.742
- Oh, no. No, no, no. No, no.
- 'Cause we're not ready for that.

17:17.778 --> 17:21.012
- Yeah. Absolutely not. Agreed.
- I mean, things are great

17:21.080 --> 17:23.383
- between us, right?
- Yeah! Things are great.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.886
I mean... if you don't think

17:26.920 --> 17:28.555
about the fact that we won't
be able to see each other

17:28.589 --> 17:30.557
for the foreseeable future,
then things are great.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.792
OK so, so why,

17:32.826 --> 17:35.562
why mess with something
that ain't broke, you know?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.564
OK, so we'll just, just...

17:37.598 --> 17:39.632
keep things the way they are now.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.901
- Yeah.
- OK.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.704
- Yeah. Yeah. It's good.
- OK. I should get back to this then.

17:44.738 --> 17:47.940
- Yeah. I gotta um... Oh, crap, I gotta go.
- OK.

17:47.974 --> 17:51.310
- Uh, so but we're, we're good?
- Great. Totally good.

17:51.344 --> 17:54.780
- Uh... OK.
- OK.

17:54.815 --> 17:57.783
- Bye.
- All right. Have a good shift.

18:05.158 --> 18:08.293
Wow!

18:08.328 --> 18:12.097
There he is. Hey, Alphonse.

18:12.131 --> 18:14.333
You're gonna have to go through
the coach if you want an interview.

18:14.367 --> 18:17.068
- IIB.
- What do you know about the money

18:17.136 --> 18:21.172
- that fell from the ceiling?
- I already gave the cops a statement.

18:21.207 --> 18:24.409
I thought I was in the clear...
Sorry but, uh, I gotta go

18:24.444 --> 18:26.712
- to the shower.
- The money. You were saying?

18:26.779 --> 18:29.080
I wasn't.

18:29.115 --> 18:31.516
- Who gave it to you, Alphonse?
- And why the ceiling?

18:31.551 --> 18:33.585
I mean, that seems like such a
risky place to put that much money.

18:33.653 --> 18:36.821
I guess there was nowhere else
to put it, huh? When JJ saw you,

18:36.889 --> 18:40.424
- he suspected something.
- He said that? He's crazy!

18:50.035 --> 18:52.837
So if I look in your jacket right now,

18:52.905 --> 18:54.973
I won't find the cash?

19:00.780 --> 19:02.813
Argh!

19:09.187 --> 19:12.689
- Yeah.
- You're under arrest.

19:12.757 --> 19:15.392
I'm gonna need to talk to my lawyer.

19:24.936 --> 19:27.369
You've got to be kidding me.

19:27.437 --> 19:29.538
- Logan.
- Yeah?

19:29.572 --> 19:32.655
- What the hell's he doing here?
- We followed another line of investigation.

19:32.681 --> 19:35.269
You didn't think about
clearing that with me first?

19:35.412 --> 19:38.981
We're trying to keep this investigation
under wraps because of the hell storm

19:39.049 --> 19:42.151
that will surely explode if anyone finds
out Metro evidence lockup was breached,

19:42.219 --> 19:45.321
and you two are running around
arresting star quarterbacks? On what?

19:45.355 --> 19:47.389
- One of your little hunches?
- Alphonse is our guy.

19:47.457 --> 19:50.326
No. JJ's the prime suspect.

19:50.393 --> 19:53.162
He is the one with the contacts.
He is the one with the background.

19:53.197 --> 19:55.764
That is where you focus your energies.

19:55.832 --> 19:59.267
You two are just wasting department
time and energy on an innocent man.

20:01.037 --> 20:02.705
He had this.

20:12.852 --> 20:16.287
$1000 in marked $20 bills.

20:16.322 --> 20:18.923
It's from the same stash of money
that was found in the ceiling

20:18.957 --> 20:22.360
of the Titans' locker room.
And that money was stolen

20:22.394 --> 20:25.396
from police evidence lockup.

20:27.466 --> 20:30.768
I don't know anything
about the police lockup.

20:30.802 --> 20:32.770
I took the money when it fell.

20:32.804 --> 20:35.406
See, we have a video
showing that all the money

20:35.441 --> 20:37.775
that fell out of the ceiling was recovered.

20:37.809 --> 20:40.911
So... where did you get it?

20:44.850 --> 20:47.918
Quarterfinal against The
Dragons... 20-point spread.

20:50.722 --> 20:53.724
And in college ball, the
only time that money like that

20:53.759 --> 20:56.193
is flying around is when someone's betting

20:56.227 --> 20:58.696
on the outcome. You
know, I was just thinking

20:58.764 --> 21:00.817
that if someone were to cook the upcoming

21:00.843 --> 21:01.632
quarterfinal games, they
could make a killing.

21:01.667 --> 21:04.135
- Oh, yeah.
- That is a baseless accusation.

21:04.202 --> 21:06.336
We know you did it, OK? What
we're trying to understand here

21:06.371 --> 21:08.305
is why would you throw
away your scholarship?

21:08.373 --> 21:11.909
I told you. I didn't do anything.

21:11.943 --> 21:13.911
Mom's got nobody else...

21:13.945 --> 21:16.513
How am I gonna pay for the doctors now?

21:16.548 --> 21:18.515
Look, you're a good kid.

21:18.550 --> 21:22.352
You wouldn't do something like this
unless you were desperate, right?

21:22.420 --> 21:25.689
So I'm trying to figure it out
here. Is it someone you know

21:25.723 --> 21:28.124
was in trouble or...?

21:28.159 --> 21:30.660
Is it someone that you love? Are they sick?

21:30.695 --> 21:33.496
- Yeah?
- You took a payoff, but I'm guessing

21:33.530 --> 21:35.965
you didn't even know who
the money was stolen from.

21:38.368 --> 21:41.971
I just hope that someone's taking care
of your mother when you're in prison.

21:49.613 --> 21:52.281
- Hey. I've gotta talk to him.
- My client's willing to talk.

21:54.484 --> 21:57.720
In exchange for immunity.

22:02.959 --> 22:04.893
We're listening.

22:04.961 --> 22:08.030
I'm all my mother's got.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.866
And if I don't get her to this...

22:10.934 --> 22:13.802
experimental chemo clinic

22:13.870 --> 22:15.871
in Ohio,

22:15.939 --> 22:17.873
she's gonna die.

22:17.941 --> 22:20.275
I had...

22:20.309 --> 22:22.477
met this guy at the club

22:22.511 --> 22:24.847
a few times.

22:24.914 --> 22:26.849
He overheard me talking about

22:26.916 --> 22:29.284
how my mother needed surgery...

22:31.387 --> 22:35.056
And he said that...

22:35.090 --> 22:37.892
he'd pay high dollars

22:37.960 --> 22:41.563
if I just fix the point
spread in our next game.

22:41.631 --> 22:42.830
Who is this guy?

22:42.898 --> 22:44.932
Jim.

22:46.869 --> 22:49.070
Never got a last name.

22:58.347 --> 23:01.449
Logan. I wanted to ask you a question.

23:01.517 --> 23:04.252
How'd you figure out about
Alphonse Reid's mother?

23:04.286 --> 23:06.687
Well, Alphonse looked down

23:06.721 --> 23:09.456
and to the right when I asked
him why he wanted the money.

23:09.491 --> 23:11.525
So looking down and to the right,

23:11.559 --> 23:13.527
that's sick mother?

23:13.595 --> 23:17.331
And I also gave him the intel on the mom.

23:17.365 --> 23:20.668
I looked into Alphonse's
background and I found

23:20.735 --> 23:23.805
that he was going back and
forth between his hometown so...

23:25.740 --> 23:28.876
- It was that.
- OK.

23:28.911 --> 23:32.279
Looks like I gotta make a call. Alphonse
Reid's gonna miss the playoff game.

23:34.882 --> 23:37.984
- Good save. That was close.
- I got something.

23:38.019 --> 23:41.021
Someone hacked into the Metro police
computer system in the past hour

23:41.055 --> 23:43.790
using an anonymous IP address.
They erased the login history

23:43.825 --> 23:45.826
from Metro's evidence lockup subsystem.

23:45.860 --> 23:49.139
So someone knows we're onto
them. Covering their tracks.

23:49.165 --> 23:51.331
Exactly. But I was able
to access the memory dump

23:51.365 --> 23:53.333
from the backup server and
retrieved the deleted files.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.435
Our perp recoded some
of the tracking numbers

23:55.469 --> 23:57.737
- from the evidence boxes.
- It's a virtual break-in.

23:57.771 --> 24:01.341
So no one physically entered Metro's
lockup to steal the cash. It was all done

24:01.375 --> 24:03.343
- through the computer.
- Each evidence box is assigned

24:03.377 --> 24:05.378
a tracking number, printed
from the evidence log.

24:05.412 --> 24:09.081
See, the tracking number
originally assigned to the 200,000

24:09.115 --> 24:11.718
from the Sangres bust was switched

24:11.752 --> 24:14.854
- with this box.
- It's just a bunch of cell phones

24:14.888 --> 24:18.190
and electronics junk. It's evidence in
a burglary case already gone to trial.

24:18.258 --> 24:20.393
It's scheduled to be released
to the original owners.

24:20.427 --> 24:23.162
Right. So this is how someone
was able to walk in, grab the cash

24:23.230 --> 24:26.131
- without any questions being asked.
- Which is why no one from Metro

24:26.199 --> 24:29.234
knew that the cash was missing until
it fell from the Titans' ceiling.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.202
That's...

24:31.237 --> 24:33.171
that's solid work, Alex.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.574
I know.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.142
Bye.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.181
- Dev.
- Huh?

24:45.951 --> 24:47.786
Right. Uh, now that we
know the actual number

24:47.854 --> 24:52.123
of the box with the cash, we
can see who checked it out.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.125
The true owner of the
box with the cell phones

24:54.193 --> 24:56.193
was a Murray Boone.

24:56.261 --> 24:59.029
But whoever broke into the
system changed the owner's name.

24:59.097 --> 25:01.932
It was signed out at 10:14 AM.

25:01.966 --> 25:04.201
The same day it fell from the
ceiling in the Titans' locker room.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.236
And if you give me a minute...

25:11.109 --> 25:14.244
This is the civilian
who checked out the box.

25:14.312 --> 25:16.580
That is definitely not
the man that Alphonse met.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.549
Thank you. Any progress?

25:18.617 --> 25:20.484
Actually, yeah.

25:20.552 --> 25:23.920
We got video of the person that
checked out the box from the lockup.

25:23.987 --> 25:26.222
- ID?
- Just give me a second.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.224
"Cindy Grant."

25:28.258 --> 25:30.159
"26 years old. No fixed address.

25:30.193 --> 25:32.862
- Multiple counts of possession."
- So you're telling me that a low level junkie

25:32.897 --> 25:35.665
managed to figure out how to
break into Metro's evidence lockup?

25:35.733 --> 25:39.135
It is possible she's working
for whoever paid off Alphonse.

25:39.202 --> 25:41.037
I'll ask around,

25:41.071 --> 25:43.540
see if the guys in drug squad
know her. Clark, you're with me.

25:45.509 --> 25:48.812
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

25:51.848 --> 25:53.849
You know, when Klein formed the unit

25:53.883 --> 25:55.984
was the first time that
I could really be myself.

25:56.018 --> 25:57.986
I didn't have to lie

25:58.020 --> 26:00.388
or make excuses for
what I knew about people.

26:02.391 --> 26:05.160
I just hope that I'm not
back at the beginning.

26:05.194 --> 26:07.763
And you're sure you don't want
to bring Becker into the fold?

26:07.797 --> 26:10.866
The last time I saw this guy, 4 years ago,

26:10.900 --> 26:13.335
he was threatening my life
'cause I got his partner killed.

26:13.402 --> 26:15.704
He's the last guy

26:15.738 --> 26:18.106
I want to share this secret with.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.776
- Toby, look at me.
- Yeah?

26:25.881 --> 26:29.084
You are the key to that unit's success.

26:30.819 --> 26:33.054
And who knows? Becker
works with you long enough,

26:33.089 --> 26:35.056
he might come around.

26:35.091 --> 26:38.726
- People can be more accepting
than you think. - Mm-hmm.

26:45.601 --> 26:48.736
- Your guy's sure she's here?
- It's one of her hangouts.

26:48.770 --> 26:50.838
She'll show up sooner or later.

26:50.873 --> 26:53.208
I feel like this is officially later.

26:58.347 --> 27:00.947
What's that?

27:04.685 --> 27:08.655
- Looks like your guys are on the money.
- Bingo.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.503
- Cindy Grant.
- I'm off duty.

27:22.570 --> 27:25.172
- I close at 10:30.
- IIB.

27:25.206 --> 27:27.341
What?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.808
What the hell do you
want? I didn't do anything.

27:29.843 --> 27:31.944
Sure did. But we got pictures.

27:31.978 --> 27:34.147
Let's talk about this downtown.

27:43.157 --> 27:45.158
McCluskey, you're with me.

27:45.225 --> 27:48.894
You know, actually, I... I
think Toby should be in there.

27:48.962 --> 27:52.256
No offense, but I think I
know how to make a junkie talk.

27:52.282 --> 27:54.098
Right. Talking is one thing, but
Toby knows how to get at the truth,

27:54.167 --> 27:57.235
which is not so easy
with a junkie. No offense.

27:59.272 --> 28:02.307
Fine. Logan, you're with me.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.842
- This should be fun.
- Yeah.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.717
We have you on video, Cindy.

28:12.785 --> 28:16.421
We know you signed out the cash
from Metro's evidence lockup.

28:16.489 --> 28:18.690
- So where'd you take it?
- What cash?

28:20.659 --> 28:23.527
You signed out an evidence
box from Metro Police, right?

28:23.595 --> 28:25.563
Oh, yeah. Cell phones or something.

28:25.630 --> 28:28.432
No, it wasn't cell phones,
Cindy. It was $200,000 in cash.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.501
What? 200,000!

28:30.569 --> 28:34.105
Only gave me 500... That lying jerk...

28:34.173 --> 28:36.195
Who asked you to do it?

28:36.221 --> 28:38.101
I don't know. Some guy
asked me to do him a favour.

28:38.143 --> 28:40.311
Well, some guy who paid you.

28:42.214 --> 28:46.150
- We need to see that money.
- I don't have it anymore. I spent it, OK?

28:53.558 --> 28:55.526
You know, you shouldn't lie to us, Cindy.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.628
We know you got the money on you.

29:04.769 --> 29:08.171
That's all that's left, I swear.

29:11.676 --> 29:14.077
What exactly did this guy ask you to do?

29:14.112 --> 29:16.480
All I had to do was sign out a box.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.216
My name was already there.
I didn't ask any questions.

29:19.284 --> 29:22.152
- What was his name?
- I don't know. I never saw him before.

29:31.695 --> 29:34.964
Cindy...

29:36.900 --> 29:39.302
I think you can do better than that.

29:39.336 --> 29:41.337
Hey, Dev.

29:41.372 --> 29:43.439
You isolate any suspects
from the locker room footage?

29:43.474 --> 29:46.309
Yeah we got statements
from 164 out of 168 people

29:46.343 --> 29:48.311
that entered the room.

29:48.345 --> 29:51.180
- OK. How about the other four?
- I just printed the photos.

29:51.214 --> 29:53.682
Yeah.

29:53.716 --> 29:56.050
These are the only four
that I can't yet identify.

29:59.955 --> 30:01.623
OK, thanks.

30:06.128 --> 30:08.096
Is the guy who paid you

30:08.130 --> 30:11.533
in one of these photos?

30:11.567 --> 30:14.135
Take a look, Cindy.

30:16.038 --> 30:18.873
You know, we're happy to send
you back to jail, right, Cindy?

30:18.908 --> 30:21.542
Him. He's the guy!

30:21.576 --> 30:23.844
This is the guy who organized everything.

30:23.878 --> 30:26.280
He paid Cindy to get
the money out of lockup

30:26.315 --> 30:28.282
and then gave it to
Alphonse to throw the game.

30:28.350 --> 30:31.652
- We just don't know who he is.
- Well, I've run the photo

30:31.687 --> 30:33.654
through every level of facial recognition.

30:33.689 --> 30:35.856
- And?
- And...

30:35.890 --> 30:38.258
nothing 'cause the guy's
not in the criminal systems.

30:38.293 --> 30:40.260
OK, well, let's, let's bring in Alphonse,

30:40.295 --> 30:42.262
show him the photo and
maybe he can ID the guy.

30:42.297 --> 30:45.898
Alphonse was telling the truth.
He didn't know who the guy was.

30:45.933 --> 30:48.868
- What about the money?
- No. We fingerprinted

30:48.902 --> 30:50.903
everyone who touched the
money in the locker room,

30:50.938 --> 30:53.906
including Alphonse. And the rest
were just from the original drug bust.

30:53.974 --> 30:55.942
Not the money from the locker room.

30:56.009 --> 30:58.678
The money our mystery man paid Cindy.

30:58.746 --> 31:01.381
Let's see if Alex can pull a print.

31:01.449 --> 31:03.450
I found 2 sets of prints on this bill.

31:03.517 --> 31:06.686
One is Cindy's and the
other... is running now.

31:06.754 --> 31:09.322
- Let's hope he's got a record.
- I set the search wide

31:09.390 --> 31:11.657
to include all government
agencies that collect prints.

31:16.128 --> 31:18.731
Looks like we got a match.

31:18.798 --> 31:20.866
It's from the American Border Services.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.502
He was printed while crossing
the border. Our guy is one...

31:23.570 --> 31:25.604
"Anthony De Souza."

31:25.672 --> 31:28.940
As in Detective Theresa De Souza?

31:29.008 --> 31:31.076
The detective who busted the Sangres gang?

31:31.143 --> 31:33.545
Should be seeing as Anthony is her brother.

31:39.424 --> 31:41.392
OK, so this is just a theory right now,

31:41.426 --> 31:43.361
but all along we were thinking
it was Los Sangres who stole

31:43.395 --> 31:45.463
the money back. Well now,
it's looking like it was

31:45.531 --> 31:47.499
the officer who booked
it in the first place.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.467
- Theresa De Souza.
- Yeah.

31:49.502 --> 31:51.469
No. I've worked cases with
her. She's solid police.

31:51.504 --> 31:53.471
That may be, but her
brother is well connected.

31:53.506 --> 31:55.473
Doesn't mean she is.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.441
Dev found out that she
was logged into the system

31:57.509 --> 31:59.576
at the same time the box was recoded.

31:59.611 --> 32:02.779
- Coincidence.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

32:04.983 --> 32:07.951
OK.

32:07.986 --> 32:11.489
Couldn't it just have been Theresa's
brother doing all this without her knowledge?

32:11.556 --> 32:14.225
Maybe he got access to her passwords,

32:14.259 --> 32:16.227
logged into her account,
and he recoded the logs,

32:16.261 --> 32:18.195
and she had nothing to do with any of this.

32:18.230 --> 32:20.096
Yeah, I guess anything is
possible, but I still think

32:20.164 --> 32:22.098
that we should bring her in.

32:22.133 --> 32:24.100
Look, I know this is your
first case with the IIB,

32:24.135 --> 32:26.537
and this could blow back
on you. It is a big risk.

32:29.407 --> 32:31.374
OK.

32:31.409 --> 32:33.376
Bring her in. Let's talk to her.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.879
She'll be here in 2 minutes.

32:41.452 --> 32:44.187
What's going on, Becker?
What am I doing here?

32:44.221 --> 32:47.457
Theresa, we have evidence that connects
your brother to the stolen cash.

32:47.491 --> 32:51.861
What? No. That can't be.

32:51.895 --> 32:55.765
Listen. You come in, you talk to someone.

32:58.702 --> 33:01.671
We got him on camera, Theresa.

33:01.738 --> 33:03.739
He's got someone on the
inside helping him out

33:03.774 --> 33:05.808
He hired someone on the
outside to pick it up

33:05.842 --> 33:10.612
and he contacted the football player
to make the deal to throw the game.

33:10.646 --> 33:12.409
You're his link in the force.

33:12.435 --> 33:14.216
Are you trying to say I had
something to do with this?

33:14.250 --> 33:16.185
Listen, if I can fix the game,

33:16.252 --> 33:18.120
everything I owe them will disappear, OK?

33:18.188 --> 33:20.255
Theresa, I need this.

33:22.325 --> 33:25.694
You find out he was in trouble
so you... you help him out?

33:25.728 --> 33:29.565
- No. I already told you.
- Alphonse was suspended.

33:29.599 --> 33:31.800
The game's in the fourth
quarter. The Titans are winning.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.436
The guys that your
brother owed the money to,

33:34.504 --> 33:36.472
they've already placed bets.
They're gonna lose everything.

33:36.506 --> 33:38.307
Your brother's a dead man walking.

33:38.374 --> 33:41.209
Letting us help you is his only chance

33:41.243 --> 33:44.980
of getting out of this alive.

33:45.047 --> 33:47.616
Theresa, you have to start talking to us.

33:55.124 --> 33:57.058
The bookies he owed,

33:57.126 --> 33:59.060
Guns and Gangs have been
building a federal case

33:59.128 --> 34:01.162
against them for 18 months.

34:01.230 --> 34:03.364
They weren't gonna throw away
the case on some two-bit bust.

34:03.398 --> 34:05.333
I couldn't get them arrested.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.669
What? So you come up with
this idea of giving them

34:07.737 --> 34:10.070
- the money from your bust?
- You act like this was

34:10.139 --> 34:13.873
an easy decision. To throw away
my life like this, my career?

34:13.908 --> 34:15.943
You think I wanted to do any of this?

34:16.011 --> 34:19.147
- Then why?
- Because he's my family, that's why.

34:19.214 --> 34:22.250
I had no choice.

34:22.284 --> 34:25.520
I had to make a move or Tony...

34:25.587 --> 34:28.623
They would have killed Tony.

34:28.657 --> 34:32.092
So I took the money out of lockup.

34:32.127 --> 34:34.629
I knew it wouldn't kill the case.

34:34.696 --> 34:36.964
I already had the confession
from the drug dealers.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.900
It was just icing on the cake.

34:39.967 --> 34:41.902
It was a victimless crime.

34:41.936 --> 34:45.472
So you recoded the evidence boxes.

34:45.540 --> 34:48.775
Tony owed close to 500 grand.

34:48.810 --> 34:50.777
200 grand wasn't gonna cover it.

34:50.812 --> 34:52.946
So he paid off Alphonse,

34:52.981 --> 34:54.782
and they gave the tip to the bookies.

34:54.815 --> 34:58.451
He was gonna double his money.

34:58.486 --> 35:00.821
Tony would have been free and clear.

35:00.855 --> 35:06.060
Where is Tony now?

35:06.094 --> 35:09.462
Our uncle died a few months ago.

35:09.497 --> 35:13.500
He had an old auto body
shop that we can't sell.

35:26.980 --> 35:29.316
McCluskey, go around the side.

35:29.350 --> 35:32.551
Logan, you're with me.

35:35.288 --> 35:39.024
IIB! Open up!

35:39.058 --> 35:41.527
Go.

36:18.597 --> 36:21.698
Hey, Becker! He's got a gun! He's in there!

36:28.173 --> 36:30.241
Give me the gun!

36:34.146 --> 36:36.546
You don't want to do this, Tony.

36:36.581 --> 36:38.548
You don't want to shoot a cop.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.684
Drop it! Now!

36:52.396 --> 36:55.832
- How did you know he had a gun?
- Gut instinct.

36:55.900 --> 36:58.201
I... I didn't know you were cops.

36:58.269 --> 37:01.370
- I thought you were here to kill me.
- Lucky for you, we're not.

37:01.438 --> 37:03.206
I got a feeling they are.

37:03.274 --> 37:05.441
- Get him to the car.
- Go running on left.

37:18.016 --> 37:20.050
Becker?

37:24.856 --> 37:27.057
Take him. I got this.

37:33.698 --> 37:35.900
- Ah!
- Face down! Face down!

37:35.967 --> 37:38.468
You're still breathing?

37:38.503 --> 37:40.204
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Good.

37:40.238 --> 37:42.672
Get up! Up!

37:48.645 --> 37:51.114
- You OK?
- Yeah.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.793
She was a good cop.

38:03.827 --> 38:05.962
Just throw it all away like this, huh?

38:05.996 --> 38:07.930
Well, she was trying to save her brother.

38:07.964 --> 38:09.831
People do anything for their family.

38:09.899 --> 38:11.633
Yeah.

38:11.667 --> 38:15.404
Good job back there,
you guys. You too, Logan.

38:15.438 --> 38:18.273
Yeah, well, we're just doing our jobs.

38:18.308 --> 38:21.609
- Welcome to the team, Becker.
- Thank you.

38:21.644 --> 38:23.845
Now if it's OK, I am going home.

38:23.879 --> 38:26.281
Me too.

38:28.684 --> 38:30.885
Get some sleep.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.896
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:42.931 --> 38:44.966
Thanks.

38:50.638 --> 38:52.506
McCluskey,

38:52.540 --> 38:54.842
I know you were up for the job.

38:56.911 --> 38:59.513
Yeah and I should have gotten it.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.548
I was next in line,

39:01.583 --> 39:04.818
I was ready, but I didn't because...

39:07.255 --> 39:09.323
because I'm a new mom and they're afraid

39:09.358 --> 39:12.492
that I'll put the job in second position.

39:12.526 --> 39:15.862
Maybe that was part of
it. You'll never get anyone

39:15.896 --> 39:17.864
to admit it if that's
what you're looking for.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.100
You have a different take?

39:22.036 --> 39:23.970
Look...

39:24.005 --> 39:27.507
sometimes this job is just
not about being a great cop,

39:27.541 --> 39:30.676
it's about being a great politician.

39:30.711 --> 39:33.179
And which are you?

39:35.349 --> 39:37.384
I'm both.

39:41.755 --> 39:44.556
Hey, thank you so much.
Sorry for the wait. Enjoy.

39:44.624 --> 39:46.858
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.027
Oh, my god.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.396
OK. I just learned

39:50.430 --> 39:52.531
the definition of a "dinner rush."

39:52.598 --> 39:55.134
Ooh! It's going well though, eh?

39:55.201 --> 39:57.136
Yeah. No, it's going really well.

39:57.203 --> 39:59.138
- How ya doing?
- Good. I, um,

39:59.205 --> 40:02.041
I can't really stay that long
though. I'm... I'm exhausted

40:02.108 --> 40:04.076
and I have to be up early
for my shift tomorrow so...

40:04.144 --> 40:06.378
Another glass of wine? Let
me get you some food at least.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.346
- No. It's OK.
- Hey, some sweet potato fries.

40:08.414 --> 40:11.049
- No, it's, it's OK.
- You'll love 'em.

40:11.116 --> 40:13.518
- See you tomorrow night?
- Well, not if you don't come by

40:13.586 --> 40:15.587
after your shift. I
mean, I gotta work again.

40:17.557 --> 40:19.457
Can we play it by ear?

40:19.525 --> 40:21.125
Yeah, of course. OK.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.397
Hey, why are we both so relieved...

40:26.465 --> 40:28.567
to not be getting married?

40:30.469 --> 40:32.503
We've been together 3 years.

40:32.572 --> 40:34.573
Right? And it took me a long time

40:34.607 --> 40:37.641
to get you to even go out with me.

40:37.709 --> 40:41.712
After all we've been through,
shouldn't we want more?

40:44.382 --> 40:46.784
You're right.

40:46.851 --> 40:49.053
- So what's wrong with us?
- Nothing is

40:49.087 --> 40:51.455
wrong with us. We're just...

40:53.458 --> 40:56.526
not...

40:56.561 --> 41:01.098
We're just not ready to
move forward, it's all.

41:03.802 --> 41:08.005
* And I see your pain *

41:08.039 --> 41:10.540
Do you think that we'll ever be ready?

41:10.575 --> 41:15.111
* All the memories, bye *

41:15.145 --> 41:17.446
Hey!

41:17.481 --> 41:20.249
* The lake and sunrise *

41:20.283 --> 41:22.351
I don't know, Oz.

41:25.155 --> 41:27.289
I don't know.

41:29.326 --> 41:32.962
Do you think maybe it's... time?

41:37.434 --> 41:41.604
* We are strangers, love *

41:44.642 --> 41:47.542
* We are strangers, love *

41:53.016 --> 41:54.983
Is it getting any better at work?

41:55.018 --> 41:57.886
You know, I am not entirely sure

41:57.954 --> 42:00.689
it's gonna get any
easier with Becker around.

42:00.723 --> 42:02.791
Well, you know what? Give it time.

42:02.825 --> 42:04.760
You guys are a unit, and they're
not gonna let some new guy

42:04.827 --> 42:07.495
- come in the way of that.
- You're right.

42:07.563 --> 42:10.431
You are right.

42:10.499 --> 42:12.500
I don't know what I'd do without you.

42:12.535 --> 42:14.969
Hmmm...

42:15.003 --> 42:18.072
Hey, come on in, Oz!

42:19.641 --> 42:22.977
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:23.045 --> 42:24.979
You're all right?

42:25.047 --> 42:27.081
Umm...

42:29.017 --> 42:31.552
Sandy and I just broke up.

42:31.619 --> 42:34.388
One minute we were talking about

42:34.422 --> 42:36.623
moving in together, and the next...

42:36.658 --> 42:40.161
it's over. Finito. Kaput.

42:40.228 --> 42:42.629
- Just like that.
- Well,

42:42.664 --> 42:46.099
everything happens for a reason, right?

42:46.167 --> 42:48.235
You're gonna be all right.

42:50.938 --> 42:53.640
Sandy's not gonna be in my life anymore.

42:56.777 --> 43:00.347
What am I supposed to do now?

43:00.415 --> 43:02.549
You just take life one day at a time

43:02.617 --> 43:05.885
- * We are strangers, love *
- You move forward.

43:07.888 --> 43:11.491
I can't believe that
happened. It was so fast.

43:11.559 --> 43:13.594
She thought I was proposing
to her, which really...
