00:51.560 --> 00:53.483
<i>Everyone gambles.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:56.088
<i>They may call it
something else,</i>

00:56.360 --> 00:59.364
<i>like the stock market,
or real estate.</i>

00:59.520 --> 01:01.249
<i>But make no mistake.</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:04.131
<i>If you're risking something,
you're gambling.</i>

01:05.160 --> 01:06.525
<i>And if you're gambling...</i>

01:06.680 --> 01:07.727
Hey.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.002
<i>...then I'm the guy
you want to see.</i>

01:10.760 --> 01:13.525
Do you ever
follow up a mistake

01:13.680 --> 01:17.048
with another
wretched mistake?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.842
I hate the expression
"I hear you."

01:21.000 --> 01:23.651
Because what it usually means
is, "I'm ignoring you."

01:23.800 --> 01:26.280
But, Professor Hornstein,
I hear you.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.767
It's just that
I was planning

01:28.920 --> 01:31.685
on taking my wife skiing in
Vermont on break, and now...

01:31.840 --> 01:33.888
And now, the online sports
book has your money.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.326
The poker site
has some of it, too.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.522
I was hoping, perhaps, you
could get it back for me.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.600
I can't get you back
what I don't have.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.491
I gave you a coupon for
discounted play on the site.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.246
You used it.
Lost. That's it.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.521
You got all the answers,
don't you?

01:53.040 --> 01:54.087
Of course you do.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.681
Okay.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.406
Professor, you ever heard
of Rush Street Capital?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.130
Yeah.
I worked there.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.408
One year away from becoming
a Portfolio Manager

02:02.480 --> 02:03.606
and a seven-figure bonus

02:03.760 --> 02:06.570
when the meltdown happened
and the firm blew up.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.801
But I learned
two things from it.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.167
Hard work alone doesn't
protect your downside

02:11.440 --> 02:13.727
and nobody plays
for free.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.849
<i>What do
college campuses have in common</i>

02:15.920 --> 02:17.649
<i>with Las Vegas
and Atlantic City?</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:20.565
<i>Gambling is now so prevalent
among college students,</i>

02:20.720 --> 02:23.485
<i>it's creating serious problems
with few easy answers.</i>

02:23.800 --> 02:26.804
<i>Worldwide, online
gambling has reached epidemic proportions.</i>

02:26.880 --> 02:28.803
<i>Four years
ago, the big Nevada casinos</i>

02:28.880 --> 02:30.803
<i>thought of online gaming
as the competition.</i>

02:30.920 --> 02:33.287
<i>Now, they're realizing that with
their brand name recognition,</i>

02:33.440 --> 02:35.727
<i>they can maybe get a big
piece of the online action.</i>

02:35.920 --> 02:38.651
<i>With access to high-stakes
gambling just a mouse click away,</i>

02:38.760 --> 02:41.923
<i>teenagers are the latest group
to fall into the gambling web.</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:43.604
<i>With
reports of revenue in excess</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:45.762
<i>of thirty billion
dollars a year.</i>

02:45.920 --> 02:47.331
<i>Anyone
with access to the Internet</i>

02:47.400 --> 02:48.845
<i>can gamble away
their life savings</i>

02:48.920 --> 02:50.922
<i>without stepping foot
out of their home.</i>

02:51.000 --> 02:52.411
<i>Department
of Justice has indicted</i>

02:52.480 --> 02:55.006
<i>the top 3 major offshore
online poker sites.</i>

02:55.160 --> 02:56.650
<i>Players are
convinced that a cheater</i>

02:56.720 --> 02:58.131
<i>can somehow see
his opponent's hand.</i>

02:58.440 --> 03:00.329
<i>Department
of Justice officials announce</i>

03:00.480 --> 03:04.280
<i>that Ivan Block has become a major
target of federal investigation</i>

03:04.440 --> 03:05.521
<i>and continues to
operate outside</i>

03:05.600 --> 03:06.806
<i>federal jurisdiction
in Costa Rica.</i>

03:06.960 --> 03:08.610
<i>With no
legal recourse whatsoever.</i>

03:17.960 --> 03:20.611
<i>At Princeton,
you're either bred for it</i>

03:21.000 --> 03:22.047
<i>or you bleed for it.</i>

03:24.840 --> 03:26.888
<i>And I can't seem
to stop bleeding.</i>

03:26.960 --> 03:29.566
<i>My general
concern, Mr. Furst,</i>

03:29.640 --> 03:33.122
is that you are promoting
gambling on campus.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.210
My more pressing concern,

03:35.280 --> 03:38.523
the one expressed to me
by Mr. Arnaud's father

03:39.200 --> 03:42.682
is that you are
encouraging Paul to gamble.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.490
You told
your dad that, Paul?

03:44.840 --> 03:46.365
It's his credit card.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.488
The point is,
Mr. Furst,

03:48.640 --> 03:52.042
Mr. Arnaud did not send his
boy 3,500 miles from home

03:52.200 --> 03:55.249
in order to start him
on the road to perdition.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.244
You are supposed to be earning
your Masters of Finance

03:58.400 --> 04:01.370
and serving as a graduate
teaching assistant.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.845
Instead, you are running
some kind of virtual casino.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.008
Gambling is forbidden
on campus.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.050
Bookmaking is forbidden
on campus.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.210
And if you don't
change your tune,

04:14.360 --> 04:17.523
you're going to be forbidden
on campus as well.

04:17.680 --> 04:23.210
Now, if you'll excuse us,
I'll finish with Mr. Furst alone.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.446
Paul. Thanks, man.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.763
Looked at your transcripts.
Spoke to your professors.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.521
Even read some
of your papers.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.602
You have a real gift.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.251
I want you to make
this place proud.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.964
But you've got your hands in
your fellow students' pockets.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.283
I've never stolen
anything from anyone.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.564
Dean, I'm not eligible
for financial aid

04:54.640 --> 04:56.722
because my past
income is too high.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.564
But that money
is basically gone.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.564
I owe $21,000 tuition,
due next week.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.042
Sixty-grand, total, before I get my degree.
And that's if I don't eat.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.730
Welcome to
the real world.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.168
It doesn't mean you can
live by your own rules.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.482
I'm not a bookie, okay?

05:11.640 --> 05:14.610
My official title is
"Affiliate for Online Gaming."

05:14.760 --> 05:16.649
I steer traffic to the website,
they pay me a commission.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.245
Hands off.
Arm's length.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.243
I get a small fee for
each player I sign up.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.448
I'm not living some
elaborate lifestyle, here.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.284
It's how I'm paying my way
through this university.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.446
What we touch touches us,
too, Mr. Furst.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.160
Dean, I'm in marketing.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.685
As am I.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.766
And what I market
is this university.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.925
You will close up shop,
effective immediately,

05:41.280 --> 05:43.726
or you won't have
a school to pay for.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.723
<i>The thing about
this game is you can't win</i>

06:07.800 --> 06:09.131
<i>unless you're ready
to risk it all.</i>

06:10.560 --> 06:12.961
<i>So, there it is.</i>

06:13.920 --> 06:15.331
<i>Everything I have.</i>

06:23.320 --> 06:25.482
That is a lot of
your bankroll in play.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.801
All of it, Craigger.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.564
What do you say, we shut
it down real quick?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.849
it must be really nice
to have your education paid for,

06:31.960 --> 06:34.201
but the rest of us still have
to grind for our Masters.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.442
Is your plan just to gamble
for your tuition money?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.523
Whoa, whoa, it's not like
I'm shooting craps

06:38.600 --> 06:39.681
or playing blackjack
or something.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.847
You're playing poker,
Richie.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.924
I'm playing poker against fish, Craig.
It's a big difference.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.761
And $17,000 means
zero to me right now.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.571
This is my shot, okay? And
statistically, it's the right play.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.285
Look, I've been
three-tabling.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.486
I find a guy on the fourth,

06:53.600 --> 06:56.763
who's acting like it's his life's
mission to give all his money away.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.010
Hold up.
Why did you just raise?

06:59.160 --> 07:00.730
Non-weighted game theory.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.850
Because it'll outperform the EV of
flatting and he'll spaz in anyway.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.207
Look. See his starting hands
and betting patterns?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.561
This guy is
a weak player.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.200
This is the type of sucker
you find once a year, maybe.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.681
Okay, what are we at?

07:11.840 --> 07:13.046
Fifty.
Fifty. Fantastic.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.005
Hey, Richie, it's me, Craig. I'm
a very good friend of yours.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.281
You cracked 50?
What do you say

07:17.360 --> 07:18.441
you just pull back
some of that cake?

07:18.600 --> 07:21.046
Fifty doesn't get me
to graduation, Craig.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.601
What did I tell you? This
is the one you wait for.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.330
No,no,no, you gotta be kidding me.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.050
How did you know to fold?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.247
We got the next one.
Here we go, baby.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.209
Richie, let's go. Stay in it.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.886
Come on,
don't bet at that. Fold!

07:34.360 --> 07:36.124
Shit, how did you know
to bet at that?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.406
How did they know
eight-high was good?

07:37.600 --> 07:40.080
<i>If you're a poker
player, a real poker player,</i>

07:40.240 --> 07:41.605
<i>there is no
such thing as luck.</i>

07:41.760 --> 07:42.807
Richie, you got
to stop, man.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.645
I can't let short-term variance slow me down.
That's the sucker play.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.882
This guy plays too bad
for me to stop.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.884
<i>If you lose over the
long term, there is a reason.</i>

07:51.040 --> 07:53.566
<i>And this guy was too bad
to be the reason.</i>

07:53.720 --> 07:56.041
<i>He never showed his cards,
he'd just raise or fold.</i>

07:56.240 --> 07:59.562
<i>Raising when I was weak,
folded when I was trapping.</i>

08:00.320 --> 08:03.085
<i>That's not good,
that's great.</i>

08:04.080 --> 08:06.003
<i>And this guy wasn't great.</i>

08:07.240 --> 08:11.006
<i>When you get beat straight-up,
it hurts like hell.</i>

08:11.160 --> 08:12.844
<i>When you get hustled,</i>

08:13.560 --> 08:15.562
<i>it's a fucking dagger
in the eye.</i>

08:22.240 --> 08:24.527
You were right.
See this right here?

08:24.680 --> 08:26.808
This is way outside
the norm.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.450
I knew it. That's why
I brought it to you.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.443
I compared it against
thousands of players, right?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.364
With at least 2,500
recorded hands.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.330
Look how far outside the normal win
rates the guys who beat you are.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.164
What's that, like, over a
million to one?

08:38.320 --> 08:41.529
Dude, it's like winning
Powerball four times in a row.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.963
<i>Richie?
What the hell?</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:52.602
<i>Christ, I haven't seen you
in what? Four years?</i>

08:52.800 --> 08:54.768
<i>I don't know, Dad.
I stopped counting.</i>

08:54.920 --> 08:57.048
<i>You stopped counting,</i>
<i>I count</i>

08:57.360 --> 08:58.805
You, uh, got a minute?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.371
Oh, yeah.
Come in, sit down.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.884
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you okay?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.371
I'm fine.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.571
What do you need?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.724
Have you got any connections
in Costa Rica?

09:12.880 --> 09:14.644
Why? Are you going down
to Costa Rica?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.201
Are you gonna gamble? Are you
a chip off the old block now?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.691
No, I'm not.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.250
I always thought you
were an action guy.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.651
I'm not looking to gamble.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.040
Oh.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.009
Well, what then?

09:25.600 --> 09:29.446
I was hoping you knew somebody who
could get me close to Ivan Block.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.526
No. I don't know
anybody like that.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.003
That's out of my league.
Way out.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.925
He started that site, and
he had a dozen competitors.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.684
I know. You're sure?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.729
There's nobody from all
the years at the tables?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.564
No, there's nobody.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.250
All the chits are going
the other way now, son.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.049
Now, wait a minute. Where
the hell are you going?

09:51.200 --> 09:54.807
Come on. Stick around,
play a little bit.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.291
Here.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.362
Richie. Richie, you're
not even listening to me.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.601
Richie, what about
finals, huh?

10:06.680 --> 10:07.761
I got extensions.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.405
Okay, but
where are you going?

10:09.560 --> 10:10.641
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.846
Did you get your shots?

10:11.920 --> 10:12.967
Because there
are monkeys there.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.121
Monkeys that bite
you with disease.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.045
Odds are, the monkeys will
be the least of my worries.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.720
Do you have any idea
how crazy this is?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.968
Look, Block is
a businessman.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.361
It's bad business
to defraud your customer.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.925
If anything,
I'm doing the guy a solid.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.923
"A solid." This isn't
about Block, though.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.401
It's about you.
You don't know how to lose.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.649
You ever heard of Meyer Lansky?
Yes, I know Meyer Lansky.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.246
Right. One thing
he wouldn't allow

10:37.320 --> 10:39.721
is a bent table
at any of his casinos.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.448
Every flip, every spin, every
roll of the dice had to be legit.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.568
Because he understood
what gambling is about.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.722
So, what's gambling all about?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.405
Everybody gets a fair shot.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.244
Whether you have one dollar
on the line or a million.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.890
Let's think this through
for a second.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.088
You're about to jet off to a
country you've never been to,

10:56.240 --> 10:58.083
with a language
you do not speak,

10:58.240 --> 11:00.607
bluff your way into
Ivan Block's posse,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.723
somehow call him out in front
of everybody he knows,

11:02.880 --> 11:04.723
and you expect him to just give
you your money back and say,

11:04.880 --> 11:07.281
"Oh, that's my bad, dude.
My fault."

11:07.440 --> 11:09.408
This school, this degree,

11:09.560 --> 11:11.210
what that means in the world...
Mmm.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.606
This isn't my second chance, Craig.
This is my last chance.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.648
Welcome to Costa Rica.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.529
<i>There are hundreds
of affiliates already</i>

11:46.640 --> 11:48.404
<i>down here for
the gaming convention.</i>

11:48.600 --> 11:51.285
<i>And they run the gamut. From
the guys with all the money</i>

11:51.480 --> 11:52.925
<i>to the guys trying
to get some.</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:55.447
Hey, hoss. If you're looking to
gamble in your hotel room later.

11:55.640 --> 11:56.766
I'm all right, man.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.082
You're Pet!
I'm Richie Furst.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.401
I steer players
to your sites.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.289
Richie. Dude.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.130
Andrew C.
Hey, Richie F.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.321
Nice to meet you.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.561
Are you here for the expo?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.962
Yeah, I'm hoping to get face
to face with Ivan Block.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.167
Do you know him?

12:11.280 --> 12:13.248
The man is like
the Wizard of fucking Oz.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.771
And no one gets
behind the curtain.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.001
No one.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.162
All right, man. We gotta go.
Take it easy.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.287
Good luck.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.167
Yeah, you too.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.203
We understand
you're homesick.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.210
It's not
that I'm homesick.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.283
I'm not away at camp.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.962
It's an issue
of freedom.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.767
You know what Napoleon said he missed
the most when he was in exile in Elba?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.881
Pussy.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.324
You know what
he missed second?

12:43.480 --> 12:44.561
Paris.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.530
Now, myself, I don't
give a fuck about Paris.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.411
And I got a whole grip
of pussy down here.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.688
But I can't walk down
Michigan Avenue.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.330
I can't walk down Broadway.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.925
I can't walk down
Art Rooney Avenue

12:56.000 --> 12:58.048
and have a Primanti's
Kolbassi and cheese.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.044
You know what that's like
for a lifelong Steelers fan?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.168
I can only imagine.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.322
We can raise it
in committee.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.802
The table's ready.
Who's first?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.800
Okay.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.969
Look, guys, we all know
what's going on.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.485
You're about to get
the kind of blowjob

13:17.560 --> 13:19.642
your wife hasn't
given you in 30 years.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.961
And that's great.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.282
I want to help our vaunted
leaders let off a little steam.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.642
That's why we're lucky,
because you got me down here.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.487
Enjoy your massage.

15:18.320 --> 15:23.326
<i>Welcome, affiliates,
to the 2013 Midnight Black Expo.</i>

15:25.160 --> 15:29.848
<i>Please join us poolside
for poker and blackjack.</i>

15:31.840 --> 15:36.641
<i>Affiliates, please go to the lower
deck to redeem your vouchers.</i>

15:38.360 --> 15:42.729
<i>Super affiliates, please meet in the
poker pavilion on the lower level.</i>

15:47.200 --> 15:49.521
Five minutes. I'm just looking
for five minutes with Mr. Block.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.842
And I'm looking to be on
the cover of Italian Vogue

15:52.000 --> 15:53.490
but it's not gonna happen
for either of us.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.806
It could.

15:54.880 --> 15:55.927
Maybe for me.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.241
Why don't you
give me your card?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.731
I'll put you on
the call list.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.280
on.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.210
Triage this for me,
best you can.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.447
Great dress,
by the way.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.521
Thank you.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.681
You're gonna have to like it

16:07.760 --> 16:09.205
because I'm gonna be in it
for the rest of the night.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.169
No time to breathe,
much less to change.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.249
I know. I'm buried with party
requests for tomorrow night.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.244
It's going
to be amazing.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.323
I've just been over all
the details with Ivan.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.161
Excuse me, Ms. Shafran?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.641
Oh, God, I haven't been called that
since the last time I was deposed.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.245
It brings back bad memories.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.481
It's Rebecca.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.085
Rebecca,
I'm Richie Furst and...

16:27.240 --> 16:28.571
You smell like
an affiliate.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.401
Not anymore.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.164
But you want something.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.404
Okay, so there's a couple of
ways I could respond to that.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.688
I could say "yes,"
and you walk away.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.042
I could say "no," but then
you'd know I was lying.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.804
And I walk away.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.929
But you haven't
walked away yet.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.844
Don't try to con me.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.082
Just tell me straight up
what you want.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.931
Okay.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.568
I need to come to that
party tomorrow night.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.610
There. How easy was that?

18:43.680 --> 18:47.162
Hey, you!
Get down. Now.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.848
All right, fellas.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.561
Let's go.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.730
Is this the guy?

18:59.880 --> 19:02.360
Okay, you got in.
What do you want?

19:02.520 --> 19:03.726
My name is Richie Furst.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.564
I was cheated on your
site, Midnight Black,

19:05.720 --> 19:08.007
and I'm guessing by the look on
your face you don't even know it.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.084
If I had a dollar for every bad
gambler who lost money on my site,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.561
and turned around and claimed they
got cheated, I wouldn't need a site.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.842
Mr. Block, Iran a multimodal
sample distribution

19:15.920 --> 19:18.161
at the Plasma Physics Lab
at Princeton.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.924
These numbers
are negative-3 sigma.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.169
That means they fall substantially
below the standard deviation.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.411
I could have gone to the
Internet forums, chat rooms,

19:30.600 --> 19:32.443
exposed the whole thing,
but I didn't.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.204
I brought it to you.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.001
Well, I appreciate that.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.924
Thank you very much.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.366
Have a good night.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.931
Sir?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.121
Hey. Come on aboard.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.645
It's not gonna
make you sick, is it?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
No,no,no.
I'm fine.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.121
Good.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.720
I'm a big believer
in being the person

20:12.800 --> 20:14.404
who kills what
they eat, you know?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.961
The Indians had
that figured out.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.890
And not a whole
hell of a lot else

20:18.960 --> 20:20.564
until the casino racket
in the mid '80s.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.484
Let's try this part again.
My name's Ivan.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.647
Richie Furst.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.921
It's a pleasure, Richie.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.411
Welcome aboard.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.085
This is The House.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.080
I never in a million years thought
I'd have something like this.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.447
Just got to the point where me and
my old partner, Alex Maynard,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.807
looked in the ATM account and
realized we had so much money

20:36.000 --> 20:39.004
that it was morally incumbent
on us to buy something.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.322
So, we ordered
a set of these boats.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.245
We had a good time.
A lot of fun.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.324
Is he still involved?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.683
No. Alex, um...

20:52.160 --> 20:54.686
You know, this life
has a lot of temptation.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.286
And it just gets
a hold of some people.

20:57.480 --> 21:01.530
Alex died of a drug overdose a
little more than three years ago.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.289
He was a good guy.
He was my...

21:05.440 --> 21:07.522
He was my best friend.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.771
<i>Why The House?</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:11.763
Because the house
always wins.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.162
Which is why we don't
have to cheat people.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.205
We have the greatest
business model in the world.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.206
50,000 players, three cents
a second, average rake.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.010
That's just poker, okay?

21:24.160 --> 21:27.482
The rest of the site we're doing
$1.2 to $1.9 million a day.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.730
That translates into
$750,000 net profit per day.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.646
But the math is right.
Am I missing something?

21:34.880 --> 21:37.201
No, you didn't
miss anything.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.645
We missed something.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.730
We had a couple
of our programmers

21:41.880 --> 21:43.530
who decided
it would be a good idea

21:43.600 --> 21:45.250
to write a backdoor
into the code

21:45.400 --> 21:47.402
so that they could
see player's hole cards.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.244
And they cheated you.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.243
And they cheated
other players.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.243
And I'm really sorry
and I'm embarrassed.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.811
And that has nothing
to do with what

21:54.880 --> 21:56.564
this company
and what this site stand for.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.165
You saw it.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.404
The donkeys in Compliance
missed it.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.721
This is why
they're on airplanes

22:01.920 --> 22:04.890
to wherever the fuck donkeys
from Compliance come from.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.326
But you came to me.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.766
You didn't tell
anybody else.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.410
Because you know rumors
of cheating and bullshit

22:09.560 --> 22:11.483
can affect these sites
like fucking bedbugs

22:11.680 --> 22:12.920
and you can never
get rid of it.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.401
That took a lot of balls.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.602
Honestly, I couldn't get
to you any other way.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.401
Regardless,
I'm very grateful.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.769
I am nothing if not world-class
at showing my gratitude

22:22.920 --> 22:25.526
so we have checked you in
to one of our company's

22:25.600 --> 22:27.284
executive luxury
penthouse suites

22:27.880 --> 22:29.689
and your account
has been credited

22:29.760 --> 22:31.285
with the amount of
money that you lost.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.364
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.521
Thank you.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.489
Just do me a favor
and don't try to win

22:36.560 --> 22:38.130
your tuition
online again, okay?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.281
How do you know
about that?

22:40.600 --> 22:42.250
How do you think
I know?

22:44.040 --> 22:47.123
Studying my player history, ran
it through your algorithm,

22:47.280 --> 22:49.044
saw that I was playing
way above my mean.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.201
No, none of that shit.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.806
We bribed your roommate,
Craig.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.762
Look, Richie, I understand
why you did what you did.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.805
I know about what happened
with that job on Wall Street.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.122
You were trying to get rich, and
you were trying to be respectable.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.248
And you would have, if you
had another year and a half.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.961
Those people
took your labor...

23:06.120 --> 23:07.121
And my fucking money.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.890
And your fucking money,
and they burned it all up.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.041
And now you're fucked.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.600
Because Wall Street's a different place.
The rules have changed.

23:12.960 --> 23:16.487
The odds of getting a job at a
good hedge fund on Wall Street

23:16.640 --> 23:18.802
are roughly the same
as hitting runner-runner flush

23:19.000 --> 23:20.286
in a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.167
You probably know what the odds
of hitting a runner-runner flush

23:25.320 --> 23:26.845
in Texas Hold 'Em are,
don't you?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.605
Roughly four percent.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.002
Roughly four percent.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.640
Well, listen,

23:33.720 --> 23:35.245
I put a little something extra
in here for your troubles.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.448
That will get you
through your Masters.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.325
I think that ends
our business here.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.491
Unless, of course, you
feel like sticking around

23:43.640 --> 23:46.120
and taking a shot
at a real business.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.529
Guaranteed seven figures
in the first 18 months.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.320
Guaranteed eight figures
in the first three years.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.488
I have met very few
people in my career

23:55.640 --> 23:58.803
who I think can be really,
really exceptional at this.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.281
And you are one
of those people.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.205
The most important rule in the world
is that nobody gives you shit.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.489
You want to do something in this
fucking life, you go out and build it.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.810
What do you say?

24:10.040 --> 24:13.328
Is it Newark, or you stick
around here with me?

24:15.360 --> 24:16.885
What do you think?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.249
I think any question
that starts with

24:19.320 --> 24:21.004
"Either are you back
to Jersey or 'X' ",

24:21.160 --> 24:22.525
the correct answer is

24:28.200 --> 24:32.046
<i>I was in. And I took
to it like a gambler's son.</i>

24:32.800 --> 24:35.041
<i>He gave me
the full run of the place.</i>

24:35.240 --> 24:37.891
<i>I started right in tuning
up the affiliate business.</i>

24:38.080 --> 24:41.687
<i>I learned about payment
processing, off-shore banking.</i>

24:45.200 --> 24:47.362
<i>He even let me bring in
my own people.</i>

24:49.080 --> 24:52.402
<i>They needed some Princeton
math, so I gave it to them.</i>

24:53.840 --> 24:57.083
<i>Thirty billion
in online gambling</i>

24:57.240 --> 24:59.083
<i>and I was there to make
sure we got our piece.</i>

25:02.240 --> 25:05.164
<i>Three months went by
like a weekend in Vegas.</i>

25:06.160 --> 25:08.561
<i>Suddenly I have
everything I want.</i>

25:09.680 --> 25:11.091
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

25:17.680 --> 25:19.603
This is
a good one to bet on.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.762
His name is Ojo Rojo.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.126
Mister Herrera.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.683
Paid in total.
With dollars, as you wanted.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.529
What was once paid in full
is now only half.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.082
Next time bring 500.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.610
Here we go.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.405
You might find
this hard to believe

25:38.560 --> 25:40.403
because of how welcoming
my country can be,

25:40.600 --> 25:42.921
but some of my colleagues
in the legislature

25:43.080 --> 25:46.448
believe your kind
is ruining Costa Rica.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.965
Me doing damage?

25:50.200 --> 25:53.409
I'm a fountain of money
in this shithole.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.968
I put millions into your economy.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.171
I give employment to
hundreds of people,

25:59.240 --> 26:01.720
with better salaries
than you can pay.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.006
I understand, that's
exactly what I tell them.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.286
But they go on and on

26:06.440 --> 26:09.011
about how the <i>gringos</i> and
their online gaming money

26:09.160 --> 26:14.246
attracts undesirables, breeds
prostitution, even drugs.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.288
How much did I give you already?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.845
Who knows?

26:21.880 --> 26:29.287
If I give someone 5.7 million dollars
in three and a half years,

26:29.640 --> 26:30.289
I notice it.

26:30.760 --> 26:36.085
And in return, I expect more
than advice on a horse.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.811
I want stability.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.241
Listen to me.
You have stability and you know it.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.204
We've been a democracy
for over 50 years

26:45.360 --> 26:48.523
because we don't give the
people a reason to unseat us.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.367
And the people of this country
would love nothing more

26:51.520 --> 26:54.364
than to haul an American in
as the face of corruption.

26:54.520 --> 26:58.605
So, that's why it's gonna
cost you more money.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.810
Good luck with the horse.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.801
<i>All I had to do was
make sure the numbers added up</i>

27:17.960 --> 27:20.361
<i>and maybe shave the player
edge here or there,</i>

27:20.520 --> 27:24.730
<i>0.8 for blackjack, 0.6 for craps
and 3.4 for poker,</i>

27:25.480 --> 27:26.891
<i>everybody was happy.</i>

27:27.080 --> 27:28.889
Hey.
There he is.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.366
Ivan.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.567
Thanks for having me, man.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.721
What do you think?

27:32.800 --> 27:34.040
Uh, crazy.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.731
It's a little over the top,
but what are you gonna do?

27:36.920 --> 27:38.206
I invited your buddies, too.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.566
I just can't catch
a fucking break.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.330
What are you crying about?
You dropped three grand.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.084
You'll pick it up
later tonight.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.685
It's like they
want me to lose.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.410
Yeah, that's why
they build casinos.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.602
No roll. Shooter,
you can't slide the dice.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.240
No roll?
Fuck you, pay the bet.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.361
Sir?

27:55.440 --> 27:56.771
Pay the bet,
you fucking greaseball.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.446
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.011
The stickman is just
trying to do his job.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.441
He fucks up again, he's gonna
have that stick up his ass.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.841
Why don't you
let me take over?

28:08.280 --> 28:10.362
Ladies and gentlemen,
the point is still eight.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.284
Get your hard ways in while
the dice are in the middle.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.568
Oh, that's great,
Zorro, work the stick.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.882
Guess you don't have
the stones to play.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.087
How about this?

28:18.200 --> 28:19.406
I'll fade your action.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.608
Just me,
or the whole table?

28:23.560 --> 28:25.050
The whole tub.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.645
Huh?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.451
How about that?

28:28.720 --> 28:30.290
If this goes bad,
I may need some credit.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.728
Will 30K cover it?
We'll call it an advance.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.602
Hey, shooter,
try to hit that back wall.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.450
Believe me,
she'll appreciate it.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.685
What shot Jesse James? A 45.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.361
Centerfield.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.648
Press it.
All the hard ways.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.450
Shooter wants
to press it.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.041
Shooter, shooter.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.608
Six, the hard way.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.810
If he doesn't roll
a seven and crap out,

29:03.880 --> 29:05.325
this is gonna
cost you 100 grand.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.845
The house can't
sweat the money.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.731
Hey, shooter,
do me a favor.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.844
I'm thinking of a number.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.040
That's the number.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.811
Let's go.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.644
Thanks for playing.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.122
You know what?
You forgot the eternal truth.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.049
The house always wins.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.929
That was pretty impressive.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.721
That was pretty lucky.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.570
Thanks for backing me.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.771
It was business.
No thanks needed.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.089
This is a single malt.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.208
It's really good.
You should try it.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.042
You know, I'm more of a
pizza and beer guy myself.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.886
Baked potato with cheese
and baked beans.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.528
And look at us now.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.449
Look at you.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.721
Wow.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.365
You really do wear it.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.686
Is this how you worked Ivan over?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.490
I didn't work him over.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.447
You know, part of my job

30:27.600 --> 30:28.886
is getting close
to the people

30:28.960 --> 30:30.883
who are close
to my employer.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.602
So, that's it?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.922
Just checking me
out professionally.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.931
Pretty much.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.242
"Pretty much."

31:12.880 --> 31:14.609
Good luck, sir.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.528
It's the casino toss.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.489
You know how at the casino
when they give you chips

31:22.640 --> 31:24.847
they say "Good luck, sir"?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.809
They don't tell you

31:26.960 --> 31:30.726
that "sir" means "dummy", and
"good luck" means "fuck you".

31:32.960 --> 31:35.964
Holy shit. Those are
fucking crocodiles.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.400
Yeah.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.803
This guy wants me to invest in a
crocodile farm for their skin.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.570
He sent me
these as samples.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.331
Ivan...
Mmm?

31:45.480 --> 31:48.324
I appreciate the invite, man.
Tonight was a blast.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.403
Good. You had fun.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.924
You should have fun.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.890
I didn't have fun, I fucking hated it.
I don't know why.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.690
It used to be fun.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.207
Started out, it was fun.
Fuck.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.567
Started out, it was the
greatest thing in the world.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.051
It's like everything
you ever thought

32:04.120 --> 32:05.724
you wanted when you
were 13 years old.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.523
Listen, I got a guy, he's
coming in from London.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.081
His name is Brett Sheck.
We call him "Shecky."

32:14.280 --> 32:15.520
He's a super affiliate.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.808
His players would represent over
10 percent of our business.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.166
Okay.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.242
Currently, he's with these
pussies at Ultimate Bet.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.688
I think you can sign him.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.605
If you do,
it's gonna be on for you.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.967
Because you're going to commission
everything you bring in.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.408
And that's when the real exponential
money starts.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.882
And I'm excited
to see you spend it.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.286
You up for it?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.487
I'm on it.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.450
All right.  Good.
You want to throw one?

32:40.640 --> 32:43.723
What kind of question is that?
Of course I want to throw one.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.931
I love those
little slimy bastards.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.684
They remind me of everybody who
wants to take a piece out of me.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.602
Looks like somebody
made a new friend.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.368
- Yeah, I did.
- Well...

33:15.040 --> 33:16.405
Good.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.528
You want me
to stay away.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.326
No. I want you to
do whatever you want.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.049
God knows I do.
Hmm.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.168
You certainly do.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.883
Get some rest, yeah?

34:11.120 --> 34:13.043
You called him on cheating
you and got yourself a job.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.771
I think that deserves a round
of applause.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.809
What is this?
Who the fuck are you?

34:17.960 --> 34:20.645
If I un-cuff you, you're not gonna
do anything stupid, like run?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.449
Because I'll shoot you.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.766
The FBI is in the
kidnapping business now?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.001
I do whatever I want.

34:29.120 --> 34:32.043
Man, I'm in fucking Costa Rica.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.969
Look, I wanted
to get you alone

34:34.040 --> 34:37.089
and I didn't want your boss
to see us together.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.242
You should be thanking me.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.164
My name is Eric Shavers.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.525
Don't call me "Eric."

34:42.920 --> 34:44.922
Call me "Agent Shavers."

34:45.080 --> 34:47.081
And you work for me now.

34:47.239 --> 34:49.368
Can we just back up for
a fucking second here?

34:49.560 --> 34:51.483
Like I said,
you caught him cheating.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.085
But what about...

34:54.400 --> 34:56.164
What about bribing
an official?

34:56.560 --> 34:58.608
What about racketeering?

34:58.800 --> 35:01.246
What about stealing the player
list from his former job

35:01.400 --> 35:03.687
to start his new website,
Midnight Black?

35:04.280 --> 35:06.931
Now, there's rumblings that
he wants new territories.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.565
You are gonna be
my guy inside.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.449
I don't know what
you think I can do, man.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.204
I'm an independent
marketing consultant.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.964
Look, don't play me
for stupid!

35:14.600 --> 35:17.331
You're too smart for that.
I'm too smart for that.

35:17.480 --> 35:20.165
You could have worked
at any respectable place.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.810
Any legitimate casino.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.928
Caesars Palace.
That's a nice place.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.606
But you chose to sign up with Ivan Block.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.842
I'm not even a principal
in the fucking company.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.047
I can go wherever I want.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.690
You can't go
to New Jersey.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.087
Or any place that has
reciprocal arrangements

35:34.160 --> 35:35.685
with New Jersey,
like New York.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.605
What the fuck have
I done in New Jersey, huh?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.086
Or New York,
for that matter?

35:40.280 --> 35:42.248
You're not that bright
for a Princeton man.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.401
It's sad.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.006
I was talking to my
associate, Agent Mohr,

35:46.200 --> 35:49.249
and he has a sworn statement
from a Dean Monroe

35:49.400 --> 35:52.609
that says you were promoting
gambling at Princeton.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.485
Now, if you were my guy,
I could make it all go away.

35:55.640 --> 35:56.641
Wipe the slate clean.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.842
But if the sun comes up
tomorrow and you're still here,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.240
and you're not my guy

36:01.120 --> 36:03.282
then I pull the trigger.

36:03.480 --> 36:08.281
And you can forget about working on
Wall Street or any legitimate casino.

36:08.440 --> 36:11.762
Because you need a license for
that, and felons don't get them.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.251
See, I can stand here and say I'm
doing it because it's my job.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.966
Or I'm upholding the law,
blah-blah-fucking-blah.

36:18.120 --> 36:22.523
But the truth is, I'm doing
it because I enjoy it.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.090
Hmm?

36:24.200 --> 36:27.283
I love fucking
over Princeton guys.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.647
Because I went to Rutgers.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.244
Ivan!
Hey, it's important.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.085
Oh!
Ivan! I need to talk to you.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.200
What's up?

36:55.960 --> 36:58.122
Fuck, I'm so fucking
terrible at this game, man.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.051
They only let me play
because I own the team.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.321
I just fucking got
kidnapped by the FBI.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.211
Good.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.645
Oh, that's good?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.365
Oh, I knew they'd hit
on you sometime,

37:10.440 --> 37:11.805
I just didn't know
what you'd do.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.650
Now I do.
Is it that guy Shavers?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.245
Did he give you the line
about how I'm a bad guy,

37:15.320 --> 37:16.446
you gotta leave town,
all that shit?

37:16.520 --> 37:17.521
Yeah, he's threatened
me with jail.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.483
He said I'd be barred from
re-entering the country.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.843
Listen, you're not
gonna go to jail, okay?

37:22.960 --> 37:24.485
You got grabbed up
by the FBI.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.688
I get it.
That's really fucking scary.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.326
I was terrified the first
time it happened to me.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.561
I couldn't judge you
at all

37:30.680 --> 37:33.001
if you want to get on a plane and
just get the fuck out of here.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.843
Just ask yourself
one thing.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.764
Are you doing
something wrong?

37:37.840 --> 37:38.887
Are we?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.128
I make it possible
for a fat guy in Cleveland

37:41.200 --> 37:43.931
to play Omaha Hi-Lo in his
underwear in his living room.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.047
Shoot me.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.362
I mean, these fucking
shoe companies,

37:47.480 --> 37:49.209
they pay a Chinese
eight-year-old two nickels

37:49.320 --> 37:51.527
to hand-stitch these fucking
things till their fingers bleed,

37:51.640 --> 37:54.610
then they sell them in the ghetto
in the United States for 250 dollars.

37:54.680 --> 37:55.886
And I'm the fucking criminal?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.691
Then why is this guy all over me, huh?
Why is he fucking with me?

37:58.920 --> 38:01.366
Because he's jealous. He's
hating on you, that's why.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.204
He sees what you have, he
sees what you're gonna have,

38:03.360 --> 38:04.805
and he's plugging away
in a bad suit

38:04.880 --> 38:06.370
and heavy shoes
for chump change.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.284
Look, man,
even if it was a crime,

38:08.360 --> 38:10.089
there's nothing
they could do about it

38:10.200 --> 38:11.281
because they don't
have enough jurisdiction

38:11.360 --> 38:13.567
to write us a fucking
parking ticket down here.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.087
Richie, I look at you,
and I see myself.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.083
You got that same "fuck
you" look in your eye.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.406
You've been beat up,
you've been knocked down,

38:21.560 --> 38:23.767
you've been kicked around, you've
been told you weren't good enough,

38:23.880 --> 38:25.564
and you have
something to prove.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.528
Now is the time to do it.

38:31.280 --> 38:34.727
But let me know. Either way,
someone's got to deal with Shecky.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.121
Block is
a one man industry, Shecky.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.362
He figured out how
to take online gambling

38:47.520 --> 38:49.966
and make it sexy, with
the money and the women.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.600
Because that's the true
crave-able experience.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.250
Know what I crave?

38:54.400 --> 38:55.606
Name it.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.041
Thirty-three percent
rake-back on my poker players

38:58.200 --> 39:00.441
and cost per acquisition
on my casino gamers.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.201
We're at 30 percent
and rev-share.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.880
Well, I'm getting my terms at UB
and they're happy to have me, so,

39:06.600 --> 39:08.648
I think I'm gonna
stay where I am.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.729
Tell you what,
give me a day.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.406
I'll talk to him about matching,
we'll lock this thing up.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.721
All right,
I'll give you a day.

39:15.800 --> 39:16.926
But then
I got to get home,

39:17.240 --> 39:18.969
my wife and I are about
to have our first kid.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.840
Ah. Salud.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.249
Cheers.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.446
Ivan.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.285
I spoke with Sheck.
Yeah?

39:29.440 --> 39:31.124
A few little things
and we're pagando blackjack.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.964
What few little things?

39:33.120 --> 39:34.645
He wants an extra
three points rake-back

39:34.720 --> 39:36.131
and to stay at
cost per acquisition.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.520
I know it's not
the original deal,

39:37.600 --> 39:39.250
but, uh, we still
make a huge profit.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.446
No. Fuck him.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.568
If we give him that, every piker
who thinks he's an affiliate

39:42.640 --> 39:44.529
is gonna want
the same thing. No.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.006
Then I don't think
we get him.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.808
Well, then I guess that's it,
you don't want the bonus.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.121
You know what I mean?
Pack your shit.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.685
No,no,no.
Ivan, wait.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.171
I've got this.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.924
Tell me how much room
I have to negotiate.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.849
You have no room
to negotiate.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.610
You already
tried negotiating.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.841
Now, you try leverage.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.606
Everybody has something they
care about more than money.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.649
Find out what that is.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.809
Then you gotta do
the hard thing.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.289
That little voice in the
back of your head right now?

40:12.600 --> 40:14.170
It's not your conscience.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.325
It's fear.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.207
Hey, man.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.367
How you doing?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.369
Thanks for hanging in there,
giving me the day.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.211
How could I pass up
the chance for marlin?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.691
Are we good to go?

40:44.840 --> 40:46.842
Just got to wait
for the crew to board.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.891
Who's this guy?

40:50.160 --> 40:51.650
Oh, he drives the boat.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.563
Here comes your crew.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.684
Permission to come aboard?

41:05.840 --> 41:07.683
God, I love that accent.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.046
Permission granted.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.004
Come on, girls.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.722
Look, man.
Eat, drink, fish.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.564
Compliments of Ivan Block.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.404
He's not gonna match
the UB terms,

41:18.920 --> 41:21.287
but we do want you
to think of us as friends

41:21.440 --> 41:26.082
so, if you ever decide to switch,
we'll be your first call.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.210
Have fun.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.800
I'll try.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.161
Hi.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.765
Well, hi.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.604
I'm a fucking idiot.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.730
They are very good-looking.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.443
It's my own fault.

41:50.600 --> 41:51.965
I can't blame you,
you're nothing.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.447
I've got everything.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.086
I've got a great wife, a
baby on the way, a business.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.931
And I've got to come to Costa
Rica and act like an asshole.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.728
I'm sure Block's gonna
press the terms now.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.571
No, actually,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.480
the terms are the same
ones we offered you.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.965
Block wants you to feel great
about working with us.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.804
Question is, where am
I gonna be working?

42:15.080 --> 42:17.162
You can still work in London.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.927
Yeah, but will my checks be
coming from a Costa Rican bank,

42:23.080 --> 42:26.801
or Caymans, or Malta,
or somewhere else?

42:27.480 --> 42:28.606
I've heard the whispers.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.451
Block's not too popular
around these parts anymore.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.967
One of the reasons
I was gonna stay away.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.644
Player list.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.130
My man. You got it?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.326
Got it.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.680
You're a fucking genius.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.001
Come here, watch this.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.686
Wilson,
can you get 30 racks?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.684
500,000 new international players.
Right?

43:05.960 --> 43:07.962
Emails,
betting history.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.441
By Sunday, 200,000
of these penguins

43:10.520 --> 43:12.284
will be betting
football on our site.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.841
By the weekend, we'll
be doing nine million.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.001
We'll lose some of them,

43:16.120 --> 43:18.487
but luckily, we got Shecky out
there bringing them back for us,

43:18.640 --> 43:19.846
so, we're gonna
be all right.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.321
And this is
my thanks to you.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.562
It's a little bonus to show
how much we appreciate you.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.688
You're a fucking man and you
did what you had to do.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.361
Spend it all in one place.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.648
Knock yourself out.
Do some degenerate shit.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.370
Do it in my car.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.249
Which one?
Whichever one you want.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.721
Thanks, Richie.
You're a good man.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.890
Richie. Honestly, this is the
greatest night of my life, man.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.724
I can't thank you enough.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.607
You don't look like you're
having any fun.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.762
You know, we, uh,
can't do this.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.331
If you like me,
what's the problem?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.042
You know what
the problem is.

44:57.960 --> 45:00.884
You're right, I should
probably call you a car.

45:00.960 --> 45:01.961
Mmm.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.280
Immediately.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.044
Get you out of here.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.286
Mmm-hmm.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.728
I think
that's the best idea.

45:42.560 --> 45:46.770
My father described this place
as a gambler's paradise.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.489
But to be honest,
I never really put too much stock

45:49.680 --> 45:51.569
into what my father
had to say, ever.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.846
Especially about gambling.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.764
Well,
as a gaming professional,

45:54.920 --> 45:57.446
that's exactly the type of
customer I want in the world.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.840
You would love him then.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.843
But as your friend,
I'm sorry.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.682
As my friend?

46:04.160 --> 46:05.161
Let's just...

46:05.360 --> 46:06.566
No. No, you're right.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.449
Let's not get
too excited, okay?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.250
No,no,no.
Too strong.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.448
Um, wrong word.
"Colleague."

46:12.600 --> 46:13.681
Much better.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.444
I can work with that.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.523
How do you get
used to all this?

46:18.680 --> 46:20.045
Well...

46:20.200 --> 46:22.202
There was no "all this"
when we came here.

46:22.360 --> 46:25.125
We built it all,
Ivan and I.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.761
So, you two were together?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.363
It was a moment. Um...

46:32.720 --> 46:34.768
But it wasn't like this.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.684
Put your bags down.
No fucking way, man.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.444
I'm getting out of here and
you should do the same thing.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.449
Come on, man. The three amigos.
You gotta stay.

46:47.560 --> 46:48.561
What's up, boys?

46:48.640 --> 46:49.721
Hey, Richie.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.040
What a night, huh?

46:51.240 --> 46:53.242
Crazy.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.369
Yeah, fun ride, Richie.
I'm out.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.566
Out to where?

46:57.120 --> 46:59.088
Out to home.
I'm all the way out.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.244
What are you
talking about?

47:02.480 --> 47:04.448
Tell him, Pet.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.605
Just tell him.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.971
Tell me.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.446
I'm leaving
my girl's hotel room

47:10.520 --> 47:12.124
this morning when
this real hard-ass,

47:12.280 --> 47:15.204
Agent Whatever-the-fuck-his-name-is,
from the FBI,

47:15.360 --> 47:17.727
rolls up on me, tells me I'm
breaking U.S. fiduciary...

47:17.880 --> 47:19.041
I got braced, too.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.245
Same guy, same speech.

47:21.320 --> 47:22.651
You could tell him
to kiss your ass.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.051
He can't touch us down here.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.485
He said some scary
shit about Block.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.688
He's a government
functionary, Pet.

47:27.760 --> 47:28.841
That's what they do.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.367
Block is the biggest trophy that
Shavers could ever take down.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.646
Who gives a shit
what he says?

47:32.800 --> 47:35.326
He told me I could be barred
from re-entering the country

47:35.400 --> 47:36.526
if I didn't leave now.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.602
So, what are you gonna do,
try and re-open your skin?

47:38.760 --> 47:40.683
My brother owns a broker-dealer,
he offered me a job.

47:40.760 --> 47:41.807
Wall Street?

47:42.040 --> 47:44.725
I'll be rich, not super-rich.
I can deal.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.566
What the fuck?

47:49.160 --> 47:50.207
What?

47:50.360 --> 47:51.361
Oh.

47:51.440 --> 47:53.761
I hide it in there from the maids.
They hate bran.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.247
They eat everything else in the
kitchen, but they don't eat the bran.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.209
Do me a favor.
Invest it for me.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.725
I just don't have time to
spend it while I'm here.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.927
I'm in a basement all day.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.445
You should come with.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.604
No. I'm finally in the real
shit, optimizing the platform.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.091
That's where
the real money's at.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.328
To be honest,
super-rich works for me.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.729
Richie, I understand
the path you're on.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.161
But you should
pack it in, pal.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.884
I can't do it, hoss.

48:22.080 --> 48:23.650
My future is here.

48:30.200 --> 48:32.202
All right, hoss.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.211
See you.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.525
- Hello.
<i>- Young Richie!</i>

48:43.680 --> 48:45.205
I got something
I need you to do.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.846
It's gonna be a crash course
in client relations.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.046
Ivan.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.360
Excuse me, Richie.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.566
I'm sorry,
what's the problem?

48:51.640 --> 48:53.085
Send someone else.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.604
Why would I do that?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.841
You don't have any
personal feelings in this.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.041
Please.

49:02.080 --> 49:04.082
Okay, look, here's
what I need you to do.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.810
Meet Wilson at the casino.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.883
<i>Wilson will give you a key.</i>

49:08.040 --> 49:12.887
<i>You are gonna use that key to go
to the cage and open box 765.</i>

49:13.040 --> 49:16.362
<i>You are gonna remove
the contents of that box.</i>

49:16.840 --> 49:18.490
300 racks. Domestic.

49:19.240 --> 49:22.926
<i>I want you to give what's inside
that briefcase to Mr. Herrera.</i>

49:23.400 --> 49:26.768
<i>He's the gaming commissioner, which
makes him Caesar in this country.</i>

49:26.920 --> 49:28.968
<i>Without him,
we can't operate.</i>

49:33.920 --> 49:36.366
My friend.
How are you doing?

49:36.520 --> 49:38.443
Good, how are you?
I'm really great.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.125
Let's make a hug.

49:40.280 --> 49:44.046
I want you to meet
a magical unicorn.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.766
Very rare.

49:46.040 --> 49:47.929
Would you like to partake?

49:49.440 --> 49:50.680
I'm fine, thank you.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.127
Okay. Come have a seat.

49:58.920 --> 50:00.445
Sit. Sit.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.051
Let me show you something.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.202
Let's talk about the...
Right?

50:04.360 --> 50:05.361
It's something else.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.766
First class.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.281
Not coach. First class.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.201
It's a very nice gesture.
I'm good to go.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.284
Right here!

50:44.680 --> 50:47.001
Mmm?

50:53.120 --> 50:56.124
Is there somebody else
coming with the rest of it?

50:58.040 --> 50:59.371
The rest?

51:00.320 --> 51:01.560
The rest.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.651
No, that is
the entire selection.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.521
Well, maybe we have had
a misunderstanding.

51:09.680 --> 51:14.208
Or perhaps your boss is
trying to send me a message.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.321
Um...

51:22.040 --> 51:25.886
I'd be happy to let him know
that you're unhappy.

51:26.400 --> 51:29.165
Why don't I take care of your
tab for the evening, huh?

51:30.840 --> 51:32.080
It'd be my pleasure.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.610
Here. You know what?

51:42.840 --> 51:45.411
Thank you.
It's very generous.

51:45.560 --> 51:48.211
I will let Ivan know
about this misunderstanding.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.041
Okay.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.927
You think you can buy me

52:44.080 --> 52:47.402
with some cheap whores like
some fucking congressman?

52:48.080 --> 52:52.608
Tell your <i>puto gringo</i> boss
I'm sending a message.

53:04.720 --> 53:05.926
Ivan!

53:06.920 --> 53:08.285
Block!

53:09.320 --> 53:10.526
Did you get in a fight
with your kid sister?

53:10.600 --> 53:11.840
Funny guy.
Where is he?

53:11.920 --> 53:13.968
Richie, you were just a little too
good-looking for this racket.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.047
Why did you short him?

53:15.120 --> 53:16.451
I didn't short him.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.290
It's an ongoing negotiation.

53:18.440 --> 53:20.488
Then you got more than
an ongoing negotiation.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.608
You have
a fucking problem.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.331
Did he take the money?

53:24.480 --> 53:25.481
Yeah, he took it.

53:25.680 --> 53:27.603
Then what's the fucking
problem, Richie?

53:27.760 --> 53:29.603
I mean, it's the gambling
business in Costa Rica.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.921
Occasionally, you get
punched in the face.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.809
You let me walk
right into it, Ivan.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.611
This is your job.
You understand?

53:35.760 --> 53:37.808
If you want a safer job, go
work for the post office.

53:37.960 --> 53:40.122
You want a clear conscience?
Go start a charity.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.687
But if you want
your own fucking island

53:42.840 --> 53:44.968
and your boss says you gotta go
out there and take a beating,

53:45.120 --> 53:47.487
go out there, take it,
come back to work and say,

53:47.640 --> 53:50.325
"Do you need me
to do it again?"

53:52.480 --> 53:56.326
Because right now, lam giving
you the keys to the kingdom.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.289
How did you know I'd even
make it out of there alive?

53:58.360 --> 53:59.441
How did you know?

53:59.520 --> 54:01.329
Because you're a winner.

54:01.840 --> 54:03.171
Because I believe in you.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.322
And you got hurt.
I'm sorry.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.689
But if I'm telling the truth,
I'd do it again.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.729
What the fuck
you looking at?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.809
Did you see this coming?

54:23.000 --> 54:26.129
Six months ago, Herrera wouldn't
have touched anyone I know.

54:26.720 --> 54:29.246
And six weeks from now,
that could be me.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.845
Or it could be you.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.207
We're moving up the timetable.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.566
Okay?

54:41.360 --> 54:45.604
<i>When the wrong card hits the
board, you can go from a great hand</i>

54:46.080 --> 54:48.003
<i>to one that can't win.</i>

54:49.840 --> 54:51.808
<i>And if you're smart enough,</i>

54:53.640 --> 54:56.086
<i>you get out while you can.</i>

55:12.760 --> 55:14.410
Hey, what's going on?

55:19.360 --> 55:20.441
What is the...

55:22.960 --> 55:24.564
What the fuck?

55:30.760 --> 55:31.921
Hello.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.890
You have been selected because
of suspicion of drugs.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.365
I don't have any drugs.

55:37.560 --> 55:38.607
We'll see.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.808
"We'll see"? I don't
have any fucking drugs!

55:53.440 --> 55:56.205
I think the lab is going to test
positive for Mexican Brown.

55:56.360 --> 55:57.521
That's not fucking mine.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.727
Tar heroin.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.281
Come on, man.
You planted that!

56:02.160 --> 56:04.447
Pasaporte,
United States, huh?

56:04.600 --> 56:06.648
You're not going
to need this anymore.

56:06.720 --> 56:08.961
Oh, Richie, Richie, Richie.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.565
You're making me look bad.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.728
Shavers, look,
I believe you.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.769
Everything you said about
Block is true, okay?

56:15.920 --> 56:16.921
I'm trying to go home.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.367
You can't go home now.
Now that the fun's starting.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.005
Especially not without
your passport.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.446
And I know you
can't go home now

56:22.520 --> 56:23.885
that the sergeant
has his hands on you.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.650
He's been a bad boy.

56:26.760 --> 56:29.206
Now, Richie, this is what I'm
willing to do for you, man.

56:29.400 --> 56:31.641
So I'll talk to the sergeant and
have him wipe the slate clean.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.370
You'll never know this happened.
How about that?

56:33.520 --> 56:35.010
You want me to
do that for you, huh?

56:35.200 --> 56:36.440
Sergeant, can you do that?

56:36.600 --> 56:38.807
See that? Look at
that smile on his face.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.401
See, that's
the problem, Richie.

56:40.560 --> 56:44.246
I keep fucking doing for you, so
when are you gonna do for me?

56:44.400 --> 56:45.731
When's it gonna be my turn?

56:45.920 --> 56:47.126
When's it going
to be our turn?

56:47.280 --> 56:50.090
What are you, the only guy
here not on Block's payroll?

56:52.760 --> 56:54.728
- All right!
- Fuck, man!

56:54.920 --> 56:57.321
Why don't you just
fucking arrest him?

56:57.480 --> 57:00.086
You guys don't have jurisdictional
issues like the FBI!

57:00.240 --> 57:02.686
But if I walk him into a
station house or a courtroom,

57:02.840 --> 57:04.729
what do you think
he's going to do, huh?

57:04.880 --> 57:07.804
He's going to buy the judge a steak
dinner and I don't have a job!

57:07.960 --> 57:11.806
All you got to do is help us
and all this goes away.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.765
Otherwise, you better brush
up on your prison Spanish

57:14.920 --> 57:15.967
because they don't
take too kind

57:16.040 --> 57:18.486
to gringo drug
dealers down here.

57:31.280 --> 57:34.090
Richie. Jesus,
where the hell you been, man?

57:34.240 --> 57:35.446
What the fuck happened
to your face?

57:35.600 --> 57:37.921
Nothing. What did you
want to show me?

57:38.000 --> 57:39.206
All right.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.760
So they got me running these
credit card security protocols.

57:41.920 --> 57:43.285
And I get in there,
into the code,

57:43.480 --> 57:46.051
and I decide to freelance
around a little bit, right?

57:46.200 --> 57:48.965
So, I find there's nothing in the
individual players' accounts.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.166
What do you mean,
"nothing"?

57:50.240 --> 57:51.969
Nothing.
Practically drained, dude.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.610
They keep enough in there
to cover the floats.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.410
So if any given player
wanted to cash out,

57:55.560 --> 57:57.608
the software would find the
money and then pay him off.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.250
In the meantime,
Block's just using

57:59.320 --> 58:01.163
everybody else's
funds as his own.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.731
Wait. So,
what are you saying?

58:02.880 --> 58:04.450
This whole fucking thing
is a Ponzi scheme.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.011
Hey, Richie!

58:06.400 --> 58:08.004
Block's upstairs.
He wants to see you.

58:08.320 --> 58:09.560
All right.

58:19.440 --> 58:20.646
Hey.

58:20.840 --> 58:23.002
Come on in, Richie.
Have a seat.

58:27.800 --> 58:30.167
So, Richie,
here's the thing.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.287
People often make poor decisions
when they're desperate.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.487
You know what I mean?

58:36.640 --> 58:37.766
No.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.490
What do you mean?

58:39.760 --> 58:41.649
Let's say you're being
charged by a bear.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.210
You're supposed
to stand still.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.488
Most people run and they
end up getting killed.

58:45.640 --> 58:47.961
It's understandable, right?

58:48.360 --> 58:49.691
Let me show you something.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.126
I really have Wilson
to thank for this.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.805
He don't look like much,
but he's a dog

58:55.880 --> 58:57.450
with a bone when
he gets an assignment.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.968
This is some surveillance
footage he dug up.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.168
Would you look at that?

59:10.880 --> 59:14.362
Take a few years off him and the old guy
really does look like you, doesn't he?

59:14.520 --> 59:16.682
This is the Trop in AC.

59:18.960 --> 59:22.567
If I wasn't your friend, I'd
say your dad was a deadbeat.

59:23.640 --> 59:26.166
There isn't a casino,
a bookmaker, or shylock

59:26.320 --> 59:28.322
from Vegas to New York

59:28.480 --> 59:31.484
that the old man isn't into
for some serious wood.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.327
You owe money like that,
you get a reputation.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.689
That's how I knew
how to find him.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.122
And now hopefully
we can get him some help.

59:39.280 --> 59:42.170
And get you
some help, too.

59:43.360 --> 59:44.964
This is my favorite part,
right here.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.167
Look at this.

59:46.320 --> 59:49.164
That isn't just card counting,
that's passing a bobo.

59:49.320 --> 59:51.766
Turns out, the old man's been
kiting counterfeit bills

59:51.840 --> 59:53.046
from Tunica to Nevada.

59:53.640 --> 59:54.880
They were about
to arrest him

59:55.040 --> 59:56.690
before I grabbed him up.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.844
In fact, I have him over at
the Intercontinental Hotel,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.126
just down the street.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.640
Here's the thing, Richie.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.089
Your dad owes $187,000 to some
guys that don't fuck around.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.801
But you're my man, and you
took some hits for me.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.809
And I don't forget that.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.531
So this is what I did.
I bought the debt.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.530
I own the paper
on your father.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.523
The only person who can
do anything to him now

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.205
is me.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.848
Which is good news, because I would
never do anything like that.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.048
I hold the debt,
your dad stays healthy,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.521
and we can all go back
to exactly how it was.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.563
Okay?

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.204
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.845
I appreciate it.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.006
Richie?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.685
Uh, come in.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.360
Sit.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.131
See this?

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.526
What do you think?
This is where they put me.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.806
It's a real soft spot, huh?

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.961
It's real nice, Dad.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.042
Yeah, it reminds me of that suite we
were comped in Atlantic City once

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.645
when you were a kid.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.289
Are you talking about the time you
left me all alone in the hotel room

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.369
while you were
at the casino?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.401
Look, Rich, you know,

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.769
I wish I had a time machine, I'd
go back and I'd fix everything,

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.890
but I don't.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.407
We're here now.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.169
And where do you think
"here" is? Huh?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.607
Paradise?

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.764
Well, you know, it kind
of looks that way to me.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.004
Let's go out on the balcony.
Check out the view.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.450
Look, I know where I am,
all right?

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.322
And I knew exactly what was happening
the minute my debt got bought

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.289
and they offer me this trip.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.646
Come on.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.280
Been around gambling all my life,
and that would be a miracle.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.925
And miracles don't happen.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.650
So you know
Block owns the debt.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.807
Yeah.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.280
And I know that's worse than any
wise guys walking the boardwalk

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.530
because it isn't just me that
he's got under his hammer.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.964
Yeah, I know.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.322
Apparently this shit
runs in the family.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.050
It doesn't have to.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.161
I just don't want to see you
making the same mistakes I made.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.890
Going after this bullshit.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.530
Chasing the action.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.524
Come on, don't let them
use me to keep you here.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.484
Go. Run.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.364
Run, for Christ's sake.
Just run.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.528
Go back.
Go back to school.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.841
I mean...

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.208
I've been a dead man walking
for the last 15 years.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.083
Dad, try and sit tight.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.527
I'll figure a way to get
us both out of this.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.682
No, no, no. Come on.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.849
After all these years, you're
still worrying about me?

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.930
You're my dad.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.085
That's your mother talking.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.568
he raised you right, guess.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.005
<i>Payoffs are how the casino
business in Costa Rica works.</i>

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.968
<i>It's why this government
doesn't shut Block down.</i>

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.807
<i>But now it's time for me to
buy some goodwill of my own.</i>

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.367
Yeah?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.441
<i>Richie, it's me.</i>

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.967
<i>Agent Shavers was right about everything.
We should have left.</i>

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.122
Shavers? You said he
didn't even approach you.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.521
<i>Listen, after the players'
accounts, I found something else.</i>

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.409
<i>It's a way bigger scam than I thought.
We're screwed, man.</i>

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.443
Cronin, slow the fuck down.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.170
What are you trying to tell me?
<i>Just come see me.</i>

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.646
<i>I gotta show you
in person.</i>

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.130
Hey, Richie.
Where you going, babe?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.651
Going home.
Yeah?

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.881
Why don't you
do that later?

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.928
Come take
a ride with me.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.051
Wilson.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.327
Where are we going?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.171
Don't worry about it.
Enjoy the ride, man.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.481
So neither of you guys are gonna
tell me what the fuck we're doing?

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.050
Get off the boat.
Come on.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.080
Richie!

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.851
How you doing, bud?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.611
Fellas.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.888
Hey. Richie, remember, um,
that whole thing

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.445
I was telling you
about the Indians?

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.682
Not the casino thing, but the
respecting what you kill.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.042
Or whatever that
hokum shit was.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.125
All right,
here's the deal with this.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.043
The over-under
is 90 seconds.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.725
Bet is $10,000.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.609
Do I pay you guys enough
to jump in on 10 grand?

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.205
Yeah, I take the over.
How's that?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.486
What the fuck
you talking about?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.130
It's so fucking dark,
it's gonna be two minutes

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.565
before they even
get the fucking scent.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.802
I brought two idiots
to Latin America, Richie.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.328
It's like sand to the beach, but
what are you gonna do?

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.720
What the fuck is this?

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.481
This is where
the Rio Tárcoles lets out.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.607
Ivan...

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.884
Your problem is with
me, let him go.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.930
Hey, Herrera, if you hadn't
acted like an asshole,

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.565
you wouldn't be on
your knees right now.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.324
So don't try
to be noble.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.161
Basically, this place is
to crocodiles

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.766
what Goldman Sachs is to
pricks with skinny ties.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.968
There's just
a fucking ton of them.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.088
Cruise ships come down here, they
dump off their edible waste,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.810
the crocs have learned
to swim downriver

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.485
and they know to bite
whatever jumps in the water.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.167
This shit

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.921
is chicken fat.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.003
I don't know why,
but for some reason

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.605
these fuckers
really like poultry.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.921
All right, go ahead.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.763
All right, ready?
Ready to fire it up?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.365
Wilson, keep the clock.
Here we go.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.646
One, two...

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.444
Fucking Christ, Ivan!

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.646
Swim!

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.248
What do you want?!

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.441
You scared the shit
out of them.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.521
Can we fucking
pull them back in?

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.125
Hold on. Shh, shh.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.441
Do you hear them?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.489
I'm fucking talking
to you, motherfucker!

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.601
Ivan!

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.210
We got fucking money
on this, dude. Chill.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.361
You've scared
the shit out of them.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.965
Why don't you just
pull them back in?

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.281
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.566
Dude...

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.041
I'm doing this
for you, man.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.281
80 seconds.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.731
Would you
just pull them in?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.961
What do you need?

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.644
10 dimes. 90 seconds.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.847
Jesus Christ!

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.480
Fucking bullshit
local legend, I guess.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.966
Give me the fucking thing.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.321
All right, calm down.
Fuck me.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.882
It's just a little fun,
that's all.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.322
Come here. Hey, come here!

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.490
Oh, shit!

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.926
Now they fucking come!

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.161
Do something!

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.481
I got it.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.526
Are you all right?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.721
I'm not getting them out.
You get them out.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.841
Pull them in.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.770
Holy fuck, man.
Come on.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.321
Let's go.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.720
What are the odds?
I was kidding around.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.531
I didn't really think
crocodiles would come.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.081
We just
got lucky, I guess.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.690
Are you all right, Richie?

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.524
You seem a little worked up,
a little sweaty.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.761
Is it the hot night or...

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.365
Are you okay?

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.045
Yeah, I'm good.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.365
Okay, good.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.881
Terrific.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.520
All right, clean them up.
Let's get them out of here.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.966
Good luck. Hey,
how did that horse do?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.246
<i>Ojo Rojo.</i>

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.881
I'm fucking with you.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.087
I know
this isn't a good time.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.729
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.531
See you soon, Richie.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.765
Cronin?

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.169
Andrew?

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.290
Cronin.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.645
Fuck, man.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.488
What's happened?

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.447
Did Block send you?

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.846
No, he didn't send me.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.247
Something's happened
to Cronin.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.767
He was cooperating
with the Feds.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.126
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.970
I didn't.
Bullshit.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.640
Let me ask you a question.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.404
When I talk to you,
am I talking to Block?

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.608
Not anymore.
I wish I could believe that.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.841
You can.
You can trust...

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.240
No, I can't trust you.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:52.401
I did trust you!

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.845
I didn't know that he
was going to use you.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.361
Stop fucking lying to me!

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.848
Ivan is set to pull out
of this place in a week.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.490
We're moving to Antigua.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.721
And?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.451
And he's looking to
hang things on someone.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.726
A mark.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.321
Me.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.566
And when he's gone, all of those
people that we've crossed,

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.529
they're gonna come
looking for you.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.965
How long have
you known this?

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.565
I started wondering
after two years.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.131
By the third year,
when we left the Caymans,

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.845
I knew for sure
that he was stealing.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.128
But by that point
I was too far in.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.641
I'd signed a contract,
there was a paper trail.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.802
That's what Ivan
does to you.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.485
He figures out
exactly what you want

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.848
and he gives it to you.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.084
I'm sorry.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.729
I hope so.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.922
Because what I have to do

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.364
to get out of this,

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.764
I can't do it alone.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.729
<i>The payoff merry-go-round
has to keep spinning.</i>

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.844
<i>And I need operating cash
to buy my way out.</i>

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.203
<i>So it's less for them
and more for me.</i>

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.487
<i>I'm just hoping I'll be gone
before the hammer comes down.</i>

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.566
Boys.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.250
Gotta love this country.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.803
Yesterday you wanted to kill me
and today we're like brothers.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.609
We are not
fucking brothers.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.282
I need to talk to Herrera.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.324
He's gone, he left the
country early this morning.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.926
Then we need to talk.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.771
Esteban?

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.851
Esteban!

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.481
Where is he?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.490
<i>I put together a savings
account for this guy, El Capitan.</i>

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.448
<i>Yeah, that's his real name.</i>

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.284
Is this gonna work?

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.970
I guess we'll see.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.523
Where the fuck is Cronin?

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.569
You tell me. I thought he
was working for you guys.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.404
You don't understand
cooperation, do you?

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.005
You're supposed to keep
me posted on Block.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.770
Circumstances have changed.
What's changed?

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.285
Block has my father.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.044
Well, if you had told us,
we could have kept him safe.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.123
But you didn't. So where
the hell is Cronin?

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.281
I'm on the phone with him

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.930
and the next thing I know
he fucking disappears!

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.041
Shit.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.609
You know what? You guys
are so full of shit.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.609
You blackmail me! You
beat the shit out of me!

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.121
You say you can protect me,
protect my father.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.044
You can't even protect
the only source you had!

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.770
Fuck both of you. I'm done.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.240
You're going to fucking help us!
You understand me?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.606
I'm not doing shit!

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.091
You want to arrest me?
Fucking arrest me!

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.083
I'll fucking kill you!
I don't give a shit!

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.242
All right, let him up!

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.607
We went about this all wrong.
I'm sorry, are you okay?

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.120
I'm sorry.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.722
But I don't have time to fucking play with you.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.450
Take a picture with me.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.250
Happy smile, gringo.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.401
Here we go.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.806
Good.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.406
Now you have 48 hours to get
me what I need on Block.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.410
A piece of evidence that
will hold up in court.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.610
If you don't, he gets that picture
and your life goes to shit.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.165
Let's go.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.683
Come on, Cronin, what the
fuck did you do with it?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.169
<i>Cronin really got
his nose in it.</i>

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.244
<i>Layers and layers
of financial crimes.</i>

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.006
<i>Block using player accounts
as his own piggy bank.</i>

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.162
<i>Laundering money and, of course,
Block's contingency plan.</i>

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.449
<i>Me.</i>

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.726
on, my God.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.963
<i>There's enough evidence on
here to put Block or me</i>

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.561
<i>away for a long time.</i>

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.565
Have you been
booking travel?

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.210
I have.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.203
I put everything
I have into it.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.646
Planes aren't cheap.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.040
Thank you.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.046
Block has been siphoning
the player account money

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.091
and directly routing it to bank
accounts with my name on them.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.891
But when this goes public it's
going to look like I own them.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.050
All the bank account info, the
missing money, everything.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.288
Ivan's told me to pack.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.249
We leave in 48 hours.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.727
Everything's ready
in Antigua.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.168
You know
I'm with you.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.807
New love.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.846
What are you doing?

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.366
Uh, you know,
I was just leaving.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.363
I was gonna go
make the rounds.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.528
<i>One last
payoff to El Capitan.</i>

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.447
<i>This isn't poker, this is my life.
And I have one play left.</i>

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.162
<i>Push all my chips in
and hope to get lucky.</i>

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.883
Did you bring something for me?

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.410
I am a man of my word.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.649
Very good.
I'm also a man of my word.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.126
Hey,
where you going?

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.765
You know, for being
such a smart kid,

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.651
you make some dumb fucking
moves, you know that?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.686
You don't think
I know who that guy is?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.967
Where he works,
what he does? Hmm?

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.441
You don't think I know
what you're trying to do?

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.926
You're done, Richie.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.447
I think you should just walk
outside and get in my car.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.921
There's gotta be some kind
of deal you and I can make.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.082
Thank you, Richie,
but I'm well taken care of.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.601
I think you should
stop embarrassing yourself,

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.287
walk outside, and get in
the motherfucking car, man.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.771
You don't think
I'm taken care of, too?

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.207
<i>Richie Furst.</i>

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.281
Shavers.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.562
<i>We found Cronin beat half
to death, but he's alive.</i>

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.846
Thank God.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.803
<i>Where are you? Are you
bringing me evidence?</i>

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.122
No. I'm bringing
you something better.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.441
<i>Block
timed it perfectly.</i>

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.130
<i>He's out the door by the
time the bribes stopped</i>

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.362
<i>and the police
took everything down.</i>

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.361
Yeah?

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.528
Hey, Richie.
Where are you?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.962
At the office.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.687
Ivan, what the hell is going on?
The site's been frozen.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.723
<i>Listen, Richie, you're
about to get arrested, okay?</i>

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.161
<i>I'd love to tell you that I was gonna
come down to the police station</i>

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.447
<i>and bail you out but we
both know that's not true.</i>

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.931
Sorry it worked out
this way.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.287
I like you,
you're a good kid.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.010
But it is what it is.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.923
<i>Sorry, pal. Bye-</i>

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.003
You all right?
Yeah, set.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.561
You'll find another boyfriend
when we land at the next stop.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.563
Younger and
dumber next time.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.846
Dumber won't be easy.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.046
Where the fuck is Wilson?

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.571
I haven't seen him.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.129
Let's go. He'll have
to fend for himself.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.967
Do you mind? Sun.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.169
I love new beginnings.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.164
Any new industry,
the first 10 years,

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.083
it's like Russia
after Communism.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.288
It's all strength
and will.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.809
And now, it's time for a
little nuance and finesse.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.211
<i>Every player has
a leak in his game.</i>

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.964
<i>Even Block.</i>

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.645
<i>All you have to do
is find it.</i>

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.009
You really saw
me coming, didn't you?

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.010
The cars, the boats,
the money, everything.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.041
You handpicked me, and you
slow-played it perfectly.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.328
What did you expect
me to do, Richie?

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.566
Walk into my party,

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.250
accuse me of cheating
in front of all my friends.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.685
I can't let that go by.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.361
That's the problem
with your generation.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.970
You guys sat around
with your vintage T-shirts

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.326
and your participation medals

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.004
and you never did anything.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.561
And you got too big
and too greedy.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.851
Okay. What are you
gonna do about it?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.241
You don't think
I own this place, too?

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.805
And where exactly
do you think this is?

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.364
<i>Bienvenidos
a Puerto Rico,</i> Ivan!

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.247
Territory of the United
States of America.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.240
The Captain,
a man of his word.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.124
I knew deep down
you were just homesick.

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.411
You know what your biggest
problem is, Ivan?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.723
You talk and you talk, but you
don't actually hear yourself.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.887
Well, I did.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.207
And you're just like every other
gambler who comes onto your site.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.410
You press it, when you should
have folded and moved on.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.761
Later on,
when you're in prison,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.966
that voice you'll be
hearing in your head

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.202
isn't your conscience,

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.884
it's fear.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.009
Ivan Block, you're
under arrest, my friend.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.241
How's it going, fellas?

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.447
Better than you.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.131
Money laundering, racketeering, wire fraud.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.647
Look under your feet.
That's American concrete.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.206
Kiss it, because you'll be
sleeping on it for a long time.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.361
We'll see.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.887
That's the great thing about America,
we go soft on financial crime.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.163
Maybe eight months on a
farm, something like that.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.890
Maybe I'll see
you around, Richie.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.930
Good luck, sir.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.926
Get this piece
of shit in the car.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.081
What about him?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.730
Him? He's a cooperator.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.080
Yeah, don't worry
about him.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.447
Think about him banging your
girl while you're in jail.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.800
Now, here's the good part.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.888
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.203
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.408
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.761
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.969
a really fucked up one
will be provided for you.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:24.603
Listen, I want you
to get Richie Furst.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.967
I want to start
this debriefing ASAP.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.891
You don't think
he's on that plane?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.331
You got to be kidding me.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.086
Go with the ground crew!

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.003
Hey! Somebody stop
that plane!

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.685
We had a deal!

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.331
Shit!

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.643
Agent Shavers?
Yeah?

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.960
I have something for you.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.201
Thank you.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.210
He's a free man.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.570
Let's go!

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.524
<i>What would you do?</i>

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.200
<i>Back to Jersey, or...</i>

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.647
I've never even been on a
private plane before today.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.447
You get used to
it pretty quickly.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.326
<i>Maybe I already have.</i>
