00:31.114 --> 00:32.512
You get the money?

00:32.682 --> 00:36.243
I ain't got nothing.
She wouldn't give it to me.

00:37.754 --> 00:40.188
Told you she wouldn't do it, right?

00:41.191 --> 00:43.489
I made the connection.

00:46.262 --> 00:47.729
You hear me, nigga?

00:47.897 --> 00:49.455
Come on.

00:54.037 --> 00:58.235
You're wasting all this goddamn time.

00:58.408 --> 01:00.706
Now, we're gonna do it my way.

02:44.714 --> 02:47.649
Hey, I got a bat.
I got a bat here.

02:56.559 --> 02:59.426
- Be cool, now. Be cool.
- Okay.

03:49.712 --> 03:51.646
You want a blow?

03:52.582 --> 03:54.777
Are you gonna leave?

04:01.891 --> 04:03.586
Yep.

04:04.227 --> 04:06.718
I gotta make a pickup.

04:08.564 --> 04:10.759
Then I don't want any.

04:13.569 --> 04:17.528
Some things go better with coke.

04:43.232 --> 04:45.792
Will you be back soon?

04:55.144 --> 04:57.840
Are you coming back soon, Priest?

08:41.904 --> 08:43.496
- Are you with me or not?
- Yeah.

08:43.673 --> 08:46.870
Next motherfucker come in here, we off.
You got that shit?

08:47.043 --> 08:49.409
Good. Come on.
Motherfucking shit.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.551
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's happening?

11:14.724 --> 11:16.624
- How you doing?
- Okay, how you doing?

11:16.792 --> 11:18.521
Okay. Have a seat.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.168
Try some of this coke.

11:46.021 --> 11:47.454
Okay.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.284
What's happening?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.653
Fat Freddie, man.

11:51.827 --> 11:55.422
- What's the matter with the fat man?
- The dude ain't got your money.

11:57.566 --> 11:59.830
- Well?
- He's been all stretched out...

12:00.002 --> 12:02.937
...like he's coming in some money.
- That's his ass.

12:03.105 --> 12:06.506
He's good for it.
It's that bitch of his that's the problem.

12:06.675 --> 12:10.406
I got 50 men on the street. If they all
get bitch troubles, I starve?

12:10.579 --> 12:15.312
- Is that what you're trying to tell me, dude?
- Priest, do what you wanna do.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.452
I want his ass out working.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.047
Say, Priest, you know me, man.

12:21.223 --> 12:24.659
- You'll get your money.
- When? This ain't the first time for you.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.261
I've had to wait for as long
as a month on you.

12:27.430 --> 12:31.457
You're trying to take advantage of me,
Freddie. This time, you're going to work.

12:31.700 --> 12:35.500
Priest, all I do is sell coke.
I don't do violence. I don't mess with no...

12:36.338 --> 12:39.705
Don't argue with me, man.
I'm trying to give you a chance.

12:39.875 --> 12:44.471
You don't get me my money tonight,
I'll put that girl of yours on whore's row.

12:44.647 --> 12:48.242
- Listen, that's my wife you talking about.
- So what.

12:48.918 --> 12:51.910
Now, somebody's going
to work tonight, Freddie.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.123
You really shouldn't have fucked
with my money.

12:56.292 --> 12:57.782
You'll get your money, man.

13:06.669 --> 13:10.036
That thing we talked about
in New Jersey, you take him on it.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.573
Anything happens, the gun's
not marked, dump it.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.604
We'll make it, Priest.

13:15.778 --> 13:18.975
I told you, I don't deal
with no guns or no violence, man.

13:19.148 --> 13:22.675
- You don't listen, man.
- You meet me at Scatter's tonight.

14:07.296 --> 14:09.821
- Speak on it.
- It's Priest.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.660
That's cool.

14:29.985 --> 14:33.785
What do you mean, I ain't got six, baby?
These ladies do what I want.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.857
I'm the dude they're working for.
Come on, sugar.

14:37.026 --> 14:40.553
All right, coming out.
Here we go. Come on.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.822
- Six a winner.
- Give me the money.

14:42.998 --> 14:45.967
- Come on.
- Pay the man out. Come on, pay him out.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.502
All right, you've seen the dice.
Now, let me see your money.

14:50.739 --> 14:53.401
Look like rent money.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.477
It'll be your mother's rent money
before we're through.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.046
Did you want to double up
on that, my man?

15:00.215 --> 15:02.649
Come on, bet 500.
Bet 500 right here.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.410
Money in the bank.

15:04.587 --> 15:07.579
All right, give me the dice.
Come on, house. Damn.

15:07.756 --> 15:09.690
Give me a pair of dice, will you?

15:09.858 --> 15:12.156
All right, here we go.
Dice coming out.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.388
Here we are, coming out a new point.
Coming out, let it go.

15:15.564 --> 15:18.032
- There you go.
- All right. Here we go.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.533
- Coming out. Point.
- Come on. Shoot the dice.

15:22.705 --> 15:26.698
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Everything's cool.

15:26.875 --> 15:30.936
Goddamn, you wouldn't be coming down
here unless you wanted to talk to me.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.810
Come on, nigga, don't freeze the dice,
roll them. What you gonna do?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.286
- How long you gonna be?
- Don't pull me out now.

15:38.454 --> 15:42.049
This nigga's got a fistful of money,
and he's letting me double up.

15:42.224 --> 15:44.692
That's what I come down here for.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.923
Hey, come on. Take that number out.

15:49.098 --> 15:51.760
Here we go. Coming out.
Coming out. Hit.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.731
That's it.

15:53.902 --> 15:55.767
Hey, Priest.

15:56.672 --> 15:58.139
Wait a minute.

15:58.307 --> 15:59.706
I gotta go talk to my man.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.469
I'll give you a chance
to get your money later on.

16:02.645 --> 16:06.206
- Later on tonight, all right?
- What's this shit, man?

16:06.382 --> 16:09.510
Dude taps you on the shoulder,
my money walks out the door.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.653
Take that shit outside.

16:11.820 --> 16:15.256
Fuck that shit, man. What's so
important he's gotta leave now?

16:15.424 --> 16:18.416
I lost a lot of money here
and I want an answer.

16:18.994 --> 16:21.690
- We got business.
- What business?

16:24.366 --> 16:26.493
Answer me, you white-looking...

16:29.972 --> 16:32.964
Take it easy, baby. Take it easy.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.167
Just relax.

16:35.811 --> 16:37.142
Thattaboy.

16:37.312 --> 16:40.440
- Get your game going, house.
- Come on. We're here to gamble.

16:40.616 --> 16:42.709
Come on, give me a shoot
in the box there.

17:29.832 --> 17:34.064
- We got anything to eat, man?
- I don't know, man.

17:34.636 --> 17:38.663
You know,
I had to put Freddie out to work.

17:38.841 --> 17:41.969
You don't mean Fat Freddie.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.509
You didn't, man.

17:44.113 --> 17:48.812
Hey, you know, you're gonna give
that hard-luck nigga a heart attack.

17:49.518 --> 17:52.146
Okay, what's wrong with you, nigga?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.016
You think it's funny?

18:03.098 --> 18:06.932
Dragged me out of the crap game
to pull me up here. What is it, man?

18:10.539 --> 18:11.801
I'm getting out, Eddie.

18:11.974 --> 18:15.341
- Getting out of what?
- The cocaine business.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.979
Oh, sweet Jesus, man.

18:18.147 --> 18:21.674
Those junkies must've knocked
a hole in your head.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.614
You're gonna give all this up?

18:24.787 --> 18:28.245
Eight-track stereo,
color TV in every room...

18:28.423 --> 18:32.018
...and can snort a half a piece
of dope every day.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.425
That's the American dream, nigga.

18:35.597 --> 18:37.497
Well, ain't it?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.265
Ain't it?

18:39.434 --> 18:41.527
You better come on in, man.

18:49.444 --> 18:51.742
How much money we got, Eddie?

18:53.515 --> 18:56.541
About 300,000.

18:57.319 --> 18:59.947
That's 150 each.

19:01.256 --> 19:04.953
That's about enough to keep your
nose open for about a year.

19:07.663 --> 19:10.427
Look, I know it's a rotten game.

19:11.266 --> 19:13.928
It's the only one
the Man left us to play.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.969
And that's the stone-cold truth.

19:17.639 --> 19:20.164
Look, I'm gonna run a number.

19:20.342 --> 19:22.333
I'm getting out with a half-million.

19:22.511 --> 19:25.309
You are, man? And what about me?

19:25.480 --> 19:28.779
You're my partner, ain't you?
What I get, you get.

19:30.219 --> 19:33.916
Now, let me get this straight.
You talking about $ 1 million cash.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.556
Right.

19:35.724 --> 19:37.885
In just four months.

19:38.894 --> 19:44.628
Look, we're gonna take that 300,000,
and we're gonna buy 30 keys of coke, man.

19:44.800 --> 19:49.134
The best shit in town.
Rocks and lumps as big as marbles. No cut.

19:49.304 --> 19:53.468
With the family we got set up now,
we can deal 30 keys in four months.

19:53.642 --> 19:59.080
Then we're off the street for the rest of
our lives with a million in cash. The big one.

19:59.248 --> 20:01.580
How long this been in your head?

20:01.750 --> 20:04.651
Man, you don't do nothing overnight.

20:05.187 --> 20:07.314
I am your partner. You could've told me.

20:07.489 --> 20:10.117
I didn't want you shooting at it, Eddie.

20:10.292 --> 20:15.093
I didn't need anybody putting any doubts
in my mind. Anyway, I'm telling you now.

20:16.431 --> 20:20.993
Man, you're fucking out of your mind.
Where you gonna get 30 keys at that price?

20:21.169 --> 20:22.932
From Scatter.

20:23.105 --> 20:27.235
You crazy. Scatter said after that last deal
he wasn't gonna deal no more coke.

20:27.409 --> 20:30.537
He'll do it for me, man.
He'll do it one more time.

20:30.712 --> 20:33.203
Are you crazy?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.806
Bullshit.

20:40.689 --> 20:42.714
Look, Eddie...

20:42.891 --> 20:45.689
...this is a chance,
and I wanna take it.

20:45.861 --> 20:47.522
Now.

20:48.063 --> 20:50.827
Before I have to kill somebody.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.263
Before somebody ices me.

20:55.601 --> 20:57.694
Are you with me, Eddie?

21:02.208 --> 21:03.869
You got it.

21:05.478 --> 21:07.139
Solid.

21:24.097 --> 21:28.033
There he is. The little fat cat
who just came out.

21:28.935 --> 21:31.403
Oh, come on, man. This is crazy.

21:31.571 --> 21:33.937
Shut up. Just shut up, will you?

22:10.409 --> 22:12.900
If I blow this thing,
we'll both get in trouble.

22:13.079 --> 22:15.411
Let me have the money
so I can play this cat.

22:15.581 --> 22:17.446
Shut up! Just shut up, will you?

22:17.617 --> 22:20.085
And take this goddamn gun.

22:59.125 --> 23:01.389
Freeze! Come on with me, man.
Get over here!

23:01.561 --> 23:04.086
Keep your hands up.
That's right, keep them up.

23:04.263 --> 23:06.788
Get up against that. Come on, get up.

23:09.635 --> 23:11.762
All right, you know what this is.

23:13.506 --> 23:14.495
Give me that money.

23:14.674 --> 23:18.075
- You know what you're doing?
- Give me the money and stop talking.

23:18.244 --> 23:20.109
- What money?
- In your pocket.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.871
Give it up.

23:24.350 --> 23:27.114
- Give me the money before I kill you.
- I ain't got...

23:27.286 --> 23:29.754
Give me the money, guinea.
I don't wanna rap.

23:29.922 --> 23:31.913
Come on, give me the other one.

23:34.660 --> 23:36.855
Don't you move an inch.

23:37.029 --> 23:41.159
Hands up and keep facing that wall.
You look around, I'll blow your head off.

23:41.334 --> 23:43.199
Keep you hands up.

23:43.369 --> 23:45.269
You understand that?

23:58.150 --> 24:00.550
Cocksucker.

24:53.606 --> 24:55.972
Hello, darling. How are you?

24:56.676 --> 24:58.940
Hello, John, how are you?

24:59.378 --> 25:01.175
Good to see you. How's everything?

25:01.347 --> 25:05.044
Haven't seen you in a while.
You didn't square up on me, did you?

25:11.057 --> 25:13.048
Hey, Priest, what's happening?

25:13.225 --> 25:15.489
How you been? Good. Look here.

25:15.661 --> 25:16.923
Loretta, this is Priest.

27:17.283 --> 27:18.511
Yeah!

27:21.320 --> 27:23.083
Yeah, baby!

27:26.892 --> 27:29.918
With all that long bread he's got...

27:51.050 --> 27:53.348
How long you been here?

27:53.519 --> 27:55.180
That long?

27:58.691 --> 28:00.283
Give it to Scatter, now.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.887
Thank you, baby.

28:08.367 --> 28:10.858
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it, all right?

28:11.036 --> 28:13.698
I'm just asking you.
You know, I gotta find out.

28:13.873 --> 28:15.864
Hey, babe, how are you?

28:16.041 --> 28:19.442
Having a good time? Out of sight.
Hey there. Alrighty.

28:19.612 --> 28:21.637
Hey, baby. Nothing much.

28:21.814 --> 28:24.339
Hey, everybody's together here.
Have a good time.

28:24.517 --> 28:25.984
Right. Hey, love.

28:26.151 --> 28:28.244
Hey, come on back to the kitchen.

28:29.054 --> 28:32.717
Just lay off. This is not
the place to start, okay?

28:32.892 --> 28:35.360
Oh, shit! I've had enough of you.

28:35.528 --> 28:37.689
Get her off me!

28:50.809 --> 28:52.504
You want a blow?

28:52.678 --> 28:54.737
Now, that's what I need.

29:08.727 --> 29:10.592
That's cool.

29:12.898 --> 29:15.696
You white around the nose
as a Georgia mule.

29:15.868 --> 29:17.426
Ain't he?

29:18.070 --> 29:20.402
What you come to see Scatter about?

29:25.744 --> 29:28.611
I got something real heavy
to lay on you, man.

29:31.350 --> 29:32.977
Look here.

29:35.321 --> 29:38.757
I want to buy 30 keys of coke, man.

29:39.992 --> 29:44.190
Me and Eddie have put together
300,000 in cash.

29:48.767 --> 29:50.894
What you come to me for?

29:51.570 --> 29:54.437
I ain't dealing, and you know that, nigga.

29:56.342 --> 29:58.333
No, man, dig it. Man, look here.

29:58.510 --> 30:01.968
See, me and Eddie have put together
a family you wouldn't believe.

30:02.147 --> 30:06.345
Now, we're prepared to deal 30 keys
in four months, man.

30:06.518 --> 30:11.114
Only four months, and I'm off
the street for the rest of my life...

30:11.290 --> 30:14.657
...with a million in cash.

30:15.661 --> 30:17.526
Not through me.

30:18.631 --> 30:22.192
Those last 15 keys I laid on you
was all I had left.

30:22.668 --> 30:25.603
I gave you one scholarship, Youngblood.

30:26.105 --> 30:28.903
I caught myself giving you a break.

30:30.509 --> 30:33.342
Nobody ever gave me nothing.

30:34.246 --> 30:36.737
I told you that was all up front.

30:42.121 --> 30:45.022
Look, don't do this to me, man.
Now, look...

30:45.791 --> 30:47.315
...don't call ass on me, man.

30:47.493 --> 30:50.428
I can't get the price or the quality
anywhere else.

30:50.663 --> 30:52.858
Why do you come to me
with all this shit...

30:53.032 --> 30:55.193
...after all I've done for you?

30:55.367 --> 30:58.097
I done told you I'm getting out
of this business.

31:00.639 --> 31:03.540
I thought you'd do it for me, man.

31:05.377 --> 31:07.538
I've been washing your wheel.

31:07.713 --> 31:11.171
I've run errands for you
ever since I was a kid.

31:12.384 --> 31:13.908
You were always the man.

31:14.086 --> 31:16.611
Who the hell else could I go to?

31:18.490 --> 31:21.516
You were always my man, Scatter.

31:21.694 --> 31:23.924
My main man.

31:25.130 --> 31:27.860
What do you mean, nigga?

31:29.835 --> 31:34.499
That cocaine I laid on you,
you used to get that 300,000, huh?

31:36.442 --> 31:39.070
And I didn't ask you
for nothing up front.

31:39.244 --> 31:41.178
Got your ass started.

31:41.346 --> 31:45.043
Now, this is it. I'm retired.

31:45.751 --> 31:47.616
I ain't got no coke left.

31:48.387 --> 31:51.288
But your lines is still open.

31:51.457 --> 31:55.018
Oh, shit, you can get it, nigga,
if you want to get it.

31:55.194 --> 31:57.992
You know goddamn well you can get it.

31:58.297 --> 32:01.460
Talk that talk to me and you ain't got
a gun in your hand?

32:01.633 --> 32:06.127
Scatter, man, please. Now, hey, come on,
put the gun down. Please, man.

32:06.872 --> 32:09.363
I'll kill this nigga of yours.

32:11.543 --> 32:15.604
Scatter, we're just trying to get out, man.
Please, now, don't kill him.

32:15.781 --> 32:19.649
You know what it means
to try and get out, huh?

32:19.818 --> 32:22.218
Please, man, I'm sorry.

32:44.376 --> 32:46.606
What if your man get caught?

32:48.313 --> 32:50.781
You going to take that chance with me?

32:52.284 --> 32:54.684
It's all the time I got left.

32:56.655 --> 32:59.317
All I got left, Youngblood.

33:00.692 --> 33:04.184
Don't seem right to shoot it all
on one load for nothing.

33:07.533 --> 33:09.831
I don't need no money.

33:13.105 --> 33:14.470
Look.

33:15.207 --> 33:17.334
Look, I can do it, man.

33:18.310 --> 33:22.110
See, I wouldn't have to go through
the shit you went through.

33:22.314 --> 33:26.273
I'd still be young. I can get into
something else, get my head straight.

33:28.720 --> 33:33.282
Look, do it for me, man, and you can
depend on me the rest of your life.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.699
Then turn me on to your man.

33:51.877 --> 33:55.438
Turn me on, and you won't have to
take none of the weight at all.

33:57.049 --> 33:59.449
Honky would have me killed.

33:59.618 --> 34:01.950
I don't take nobody to him.

34:02.955 --> 34:05.651
He picks his own niggas.

34:13.165 --> 34:15.030
You got any coke left?

34:16.301 --> 34:19.565
Yeah, I got enough to hold me
until I can score.

34:21.340 --> 34:23.831
But you listen to me,
I'm gonna do it.

34:24.009 --> 34:28.139
It's gonna take me a lot longer,
but I'm definitely gonna do it, man.

34:29.248 --> 34:30.579
Well...

34:30.882 --> 34:34.683
...I got one key of my own.
It's my personal.

34:35.888 --> 34:39.688
You come around tomorrow night
and pick it up.

34:43.462 --> 34:46.295
You should always have more
on hand than you need.

34:50.235 --> 34:51.668
Here, nigga.

34:55.172 --> 34:57.164
Maybe I'll do it for you.

35:00.913 --> 35:02.938
But this is the last time.

35:04.716 --> 35:09.449
You fuck it up, Youngblood,
and you're on your own.

35:38.116 --> 35:40.641
Meet us at the after-hours place
in half an hour.

35:40.819 --> 35:42.650
You got it. Okay.

35:50.162 --> 35:51.424
Hey, man...

35:52.030 --> 35:54.931
...that number you just pulled
was something else.

35:55.100 --> 35:59.537
You crazy, nigga?
I knew what I was doing.

36:02.474 --> 36:07.878
You want that man to give up the little time
he got left and lay it on the line for you.

36:08.947 --> 36:12.314
And you know,
he wanted to do it for you.

36:14.419 --> 36:17.149
That Scatter's a cheap old man, baby.

36:17.322 --> 36:22.089
He's a crazy old man too.
He might have popped a cap on your ass.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.161
Not with you standing there.

36:25.764 --> 36:27.789
I hear you talking.

36:39.578 --> 36:41.569
Okay, man, I'll see you tomorrow.

36:44.649 --> 36:46.139
- Sweets.
- Yeah?

36:46.318 --> 36:50.379
- I want a nice, cold beer.
- You got it.

36:53.291 --> 36:54.849
Solid.

36:57.863 --> 36:59.592
What's happening, Priest?

37:01.633 --> 37:03.191
Thanks, man.

37:06.772 --> 37:10.333
- Where's the fat man?
- He had to go pick up his wife.

37:12.878 --> 37:14.675
Hey, Priest.

37:15.514 --> 37:17.744
Man, are you on my case tonight, or what?

37:17.916 --> 37:18.974
Looks that way.

37:19.151 --> 37:24.088
I was around at Scatter's when them ho's
went crazy on me, embarrassing me...

37:24.256 --> 37:26.918
...spilling that shit on me.
But I'll be all right.

37:27.092 --> 37:29.083
Crazy mothers, but I still love them.

37:29.261 --> 37:31.923
- See that white thing?
- The one with the ticket on?

37:32.097 --> 37:33.564
I don't care if there's 10.

37:33.732 --> 37:36.963
I ain't got to pay for it.
Somebody else got to pay for them.

37:37.135 --> 37:40.696
Look. Look at this. Look.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.807
- Hey, what's happening?
- I see you still got that stuff on.

37:44.976 --> 37:47.945
- I can't help it.
- And them shoes on top of your feet.

37:48.113 --> 37:50.206
Hey, you know my wife?

37:51.016 --> 37:52.950
Where you been all my life?

37:54.419 --> 37:57.616
Yeah. Still making my job hard, you is.

37:57.789 --> 37:59.416
Look here, I got to go.

37:59.591 --> 38:01.582
- Catch y'all later.
- I'll see you, man.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.285
- Take care.
- Y'all take care, you hear?

38:05.163 --> 38:07.324
Hey, anybody want a drink or something?

38:07.499 --> 38:10.832
- No, I'm cool.
- I'll have what you have.

38:11.002 --> 38:12.993
- I'm only having beer, baby.
- Okay.

38:13.171 --> 38:15.071
Two beers, Sweets.

38:15.340 --> 38:18.571
Listen, give me one of them joints, man.
Go ahead, light that.

38:23.748 --> 38:25.340
Where'd you get this, Cuba?

38:25.517 --> 38:30.580
Hey, man. That's $ 75 an ounce,
light ounces at that, but it's good.

38:30.755 --> 38:32.382
I hear you.

38:33.391 --> 38:38.192
- How did we do tonight, Freddie?
- Just beautiful, man. Here you go.

39:00.986 --> 39:04.114
Freddie, you made something
extra for yourself?

39:04.289 --> 39:06.757
Yeah, I sure did.

39:07.893 --> 39:10.384
I'll hold it for you, baby.

39:13.064 --> 39:15.123
Hang on to that real tight, will you?

39:17.302 --> 39:19.133
Why don't you go play the jukebox?

39:19.304 --> 39:22.865
- What do you want to hear?
- Just play anything.

39:29.714 --> 39:32.148
We didn't want to come down
on you, Freddie...

39:32.317 --> 39:34.979
...but coke costs money,
and somebody pays.

39:35.153 --> 39:37.053
Yeah, I know.
I have no beef, man.

39:37.222 --> 39:40.248
Well, that's enough of that shit tonight.
I'm celebrating.

39:40.425 --> 39:43.690
- What's going on, anyway, man?
- Nothing.

39:45.397 --> 39:47.228
Selling cocaine, as usual.

39:47.399 --> 39:50.891
I have a contact with weight.
What are you doing tomorrow night?

39:51.069 --> 39:53.594
I got a pickup about 1.

39:53.905 --> 39:58.171
- Well, if it's downtown...
- No, uptown. Scatter's.

39:59.644 --> 40:01.771
Say, give me another one
of those joints.

40:01.947 --> 40:05.280
- Only the best for the family.
- I hear you.

40:06.384 --> 40:09.319
Oh, Freddie, you're so sweet.

40:49.261 --> 40:51.889
You didn't have to do that
because of me.

40:52.197 --> 40:54.461
You made me feel guilty.

40:56.568 --> 40:58.001
Guilty?

40:58.570 --> 41:01.232
You don't look like you feel guilty.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.372
You look like you always look.

41:12.183 --> 41:13.582
Hey.

41:14.919 --> 41:17.854
Listen, Priest...

41:18.156 --> 41:21.819
...I know how you feel sometimes
when you come in here.

41:22.527 --> 41:25.553
I can feel from you
what it's like out there.

41:26.665 --> 41:28.599
I see what it does to you. I know...

41:28.767 --> 41:31.600
I know how dope helps hold
your head together.

41:32.437 --> 41:34.962
I don't want your privacy, baby.

41:35.674 --> 41:38.666
All I want to do is help
you share the weight.

41:40.312 --> 41:42.473
Priest, let me in.

41:43.214 --> 41:46.945
I just can't be somebody else
you gotta deal with.

41:47.218 --> 41:49.015
I love you.

41:55.126 --> 41:57.185
Oh, fuck you.

42:05.603 --> 42:07.730
Oh, Priest.

42:24.989 --> 42:27.014
Oh, Priest.

42:32.230 --> 42:34.630
Oh, Priest.

45:07.318 --> 45:08.717
Come on.

45:10.421 --> 45:12.184
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!

45:13.591 --> 45:15.218
Let go of me, man!

45:15.393 --> 45:17.190
- Get against the wall!
- Let go!

45:17.362 --> 45:19.557
Spread your legs apart! Let's go!

45:19.731 --> 45:22.529
I'm gonna kill that mother,
I swear to God.

45:25.336 --> 45:27.031
I'm gonna kill him!

45:27.839 --> 45:29.568
Let go of me, man.

45:30.375 --> 45:32.536
Nothing wrong, man.
I'm telling you.

45:32.710 --> 45:34.234
- Don't push me.
- I got him.

45:34.412 --> 45:37.210
- You call the station.
- Let go of me, man.

45:37.582 --> 45:38.674
Up against the wall.

45:38.850 --> 45:41.546
Leave me alone,
I'm gonna kill that fucker, man!

45:53.398 --> 45:54.626
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:54.799 --> 45:56.562
8-5 to Central.

45:56.734 --> 45:59.703
Broke up a fight, 54th and 2nd.
Better send an ambulance.

45:59.871 --> 46:01.964
One of the guys is pretty bad.

46:02.140 --> 46:04.165
Two male Negroes.

46:06.210 --> 46:09.202
Probably a dope dealer.
Yeah, cocaine.

46:09.380 --> 46:12.907
He's okay, we'll bring him in as soon
as the ambulance gets here.

47:25.390 --> 47:29.121
You're getting better, Priest.
Let's try it again.

47:29.293 --> 47:32.023
Okay. But this is it.
I gotta meet Georgia.

47:56.888 --> 48:00.654
You beat a man half to death
because he touched your wife's hand?

48:01.125 --> 48:04.617
He shouldn't have done it.
It means more than that to me.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.564
Give me that.
What about this, Freddie?

48:19.944 --> 48:23.277
If you were smart, we could put you
back on the street again.

48:23.448 --> 48:27.908
I don't wanna waste my time or the court's
money on a two-bit piece of shit like you.

48:28.086 --> 48:31.647
But with your record, nigger,
I can put you away for 20 to 25 years.

48:31.823 --> 48:33.757
I don't want you, I want your man!

48:33.925 --> 48:37.361
- Now, who do you work for?
- You know I can't tell you nothing.

48:37.528 --> 48:38.654
Who's your man?

48:39.197 --> 48:42.530
You know I can't tell you, man.

49:05.823 --> 49:07.222
Come here.

49:09.961 --> 49:13.192
Now I'll tell you why
I brought you out here today.

49:14.565 --> 49:17.693
I made me a deal last night
that'll bring in enough money...

49:17.869 --> 49:20.702
...to get us both out
of this whole scene.

49:20.872 --> 49:22.863
Both of us, baby.

49:26.878 --> 49:30.507
Now, this Priest,
does he work for somebody?

49:31.015 --> 49:34.246
He and his partner work independent.

49:34.886 --> 49:36.979
How big is the family?

49:37.755 --> 49:40.849
About 50 now, or better.

49:41.025 --> 49:42.583
Fifty?

49:44.061 --> 49:46.689
A year ago, they only had 10 or 15.

49:46.864 --> 49:49.697
This key you're picking up tonight,
what time?

49:50.034 --> 49:52.093
One o'clock.

49:53.070 --> 49:56.267
- All right, get him out of here.
- What should we do with him?

49:56.440 --> 49:59.841
- Take him downtown and book him.
- What's the charge?

50:00.011 --> 50:02.844
You read the arresting officer's report.

50:03.848 --> 50:05.907
I don't deal with shit like this.

50:06.083 --> 50:07.516
Get him.

50:07.685 --> 50:08.743
Get up!

50:31.542 --> 50:35.444
Look, maybe you should get out now,
before something really bad happens.

50:35.613 --> 50:39.071
I could be happy with a plain life,
a poor one, even, if you were.

50:39.250 --> 50:40.877
What would I do?

50:41.052 --> 50:45.079
With my record, I can't even work
civil service or join the damn Army.

50:45.256 --> 50:48.054
If I quit now, I took all this
chance for nothing...

50:48.226 --> 50:52.287
...and I go back to being nothing,
working some jive job for chump change...

50:52.463 --> 50:55.227
...day after day.
If that's all I'm supposed to do...

50:55.399 --> 50:58.368
...they gonna have to kill me,
because that ain't enough.

50:58.736 --> 51:00.033
Come on.

51:03.140 --> 51:05.301
Go on, you mother...

51:23.594 --> 51:25.494
What'll you do when you get out?

51:27.465 --> 51:29.057
I don't know.

51:29.934 --> 51:32.164
It's not so much what we do...

51:32.503 --> 51:34.368
...it's having a choice...

51:34.538 --> 51:37.405
...being able to decide
what it is I want...

51:37.575 --> 51:41.602
...not just to be forced into a thing
because that's the way it is.

51:41.913 --> 51:44.040
I'm gonna buy me some time, baby...

51:44.215 --> 51:48.151
...some time that isn't all fucked up
with things we gotta do.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.721
- Just to be free.
- And will that make you happy?

51:53.357 --> 51:56.622
I don't know.
I don't know.

51:57.595 --> 52:01.361
I just know I can't be happy
the way it is now.

52:02.066 --> 52:03.863
I never was.

53:25.149 --> 53:26.810
All right, freeze!

53:26.984 --> 53:30.613
Down the stairs, mother.
Hit the wall.

53:34.325 --> 53:35.815
Come on.

53:43.300 --> 53:44.665
All right, turn around.

53:46.404 --> 53:49.305
You just picked up a key
of cocaine from Scatter.

53:49.473 --> 53:52.169
- You work for Scatter?
- What is this shit?

53:52.343 --> 53:55.141
He's asking the questions.
Answer him.

53:55.312 --> 53:58.440
I know Scatter hasn't been
dealing direct for over a year...

53:58.616 --> 54:03.053
...but he managed to move 15 keys,
and he just ordered 30 more.

54:03.454 --> 54:07.390
- You Scatter's man?
- Are the 30 keys yours?

54:07.725 --> 54:09.124
Yeah.

54:10.327 --> 54:11.919
They ours.

54:12.163 --> 54:14.631
You don't have to cover for Scatter.

54:14.932 --> 54:16.866
He's looking to get out anyway...

54:17.034 --> 54:20.026
...and I'm looking for someone
to carry his weight.

54:22.506 --> 54:24.667
Why didn't you ask Scatter about us?

54:25.409 --> 54:27.741
I got my own ways of finding things out.

54:27.912 --> 54:32.076
Besides, when I heard how big you two
guys were, I wanted to meet you myself.

54:32.249 --> 54:34.945
- I don't go through Scatter.
- What we talking about?

54:35.119 --> 54:37.952
We're talking about 10,000 a key.

54:38.122 --> 54:42.582
You do all right on this,
you get an open line, plus credit.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.557
Any problems?

54:45.196 --> 54:46.925
No, man.

54:47.098 --> 54:49.862
One of my people will call you
and give you a number.

54:50.034 --> 54:54.528
You have any problems with police
or anything I should know, you call that.

54:56.540 --> 54:58.940
You deal direct with me
after a few days.

54:59.110 --> 55:03.137
You'll see that I'm good,
standup people. Come on.

55:18.095 --> 55:21.496
- What's wrong with you?
- Baby, what's the matter with me?

55:21.665 --> 55:24.998
We in! We got the main line.

55:25.169 --> 55:28.570
And that honky sound like he can even
keep the cops off our back.

55:28.739 --> 55:30.900
They got cats out there like that, baby.

55:31.375 --> 55:35.709
We gonna be bigger than Scatter
ever dreamed of being.

55:35.880 --> 55:38.610
You forgot what we're
in this for, Eddie.

55:38.782 --> 55:41.615
That was before what happened
tonight went down.

55:41.785 --> 55:46.085
If we can make a million in four months,
imagine what we can make in four years.

55:46.257 --> 55:48.452
Now, can you dig that?

55:50.628 --> 55:55.065
I went along with that thing of yours about
getting out because I had nothing else.

55:56.333 --> 55:59.131
When I get out,
what am I gonna do?

55:59.570 --> 56:02.505
I don't know nothing else but dope, baby.

56:02.673 --> 56:04.834
Taking it, selling it...

56:05.209 --> 56:08.940
...bankrolling some other
small-time pusher.

56:10.614 --> 56:14.812
You know, you got this
fantasy in your head about...

56:14.985 --> 56:20.548
...getting out of the life and setting
that other world on its ear.

56:21.425 --> 56:25.452
What the fuck are you
gonna do except hustle?

56:26.030 --> 56:28.294
Besides pimping?

56:29.266 --> 56:32.258
And you really ain't got
the stomach for that.

56:32.436 --> 56:35.064
Now, man, I ain't putting you down.

56:35.706 --> 56:40.666
If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't
be here. I'd be OD'd someplace.

56:41.712 --> 56:45.307
I'm just trying to make it real,
baby, like it is.

56:46.584 --> 56:49.917
I mean, maybe this is what
you're supposed to do.

56:50.087 --> 56:52.954
This is what you're growing to.

56:53.123 --> 56:55.455
I mean, just think about it.

56:56.160 --> 56:58.025
Don't throw it out.

56:58.796 --> 57:00.991
Just think about it.

57:01.298 --> 57:06.201
You know what?
I'm thinking about 30 keys.

57:06.804 --> 57:09.932
Well, let's get this shit
on the road, cut it...

57:10.107 --> 57:13.270
...sock it, sack it and go. Shit.

01:01:38.408 --> 01:01:40.273
Hey, man.

01:01:40.577 --> 01:01:42.670
We'd like to talk to you...

01:01:42.846 --> 01:01:44.370
...brother.

01:01:45.048 --> 01:01:47.278
We're waiting on some people now.

01:01:48.352 --> 01:01:51.048
Well, it won't take long.

01:01:51.255 --> 01:01:54.691
Besides, you got plenty of time
for your brothers.

01:01:54.858 --> 01:01:58.487
After all, black folks
been mighty good to you.

01:01:58.695 --> 01:02:01.528
And you owe those people
something too.

01:02:02.399 --> 01:02:04.333
No bet.

01:02:05.068 --> 01:02:07.798
Dig it, dope peddler.

01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:10.804
We're out here building
a new nation for black people.

01:02:10.974 --> 01:02:14.341
It's time for you to start paying
some dues, nigga.

01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:17.002
I ain't giving you shit.

01:02:18.715 --> 01:02:22.082
Now, I tell you what you do.
You go get you a gun.

01:02:22.853 --> 01:02:25.617
And all those black folks
you talk so much about...

01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:30.852
...get guns and return ready to go down,
and I'll be right down front killing whitey.

01:02:31.028 --> 01:02:35.556
Until you can do that, you go sing
your marching song someplace else.

01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:40.196
Now, we're through talking.

01:02:41.204 --> 01:02:44.640
Like I said before,
somebody's coming here to meet me.

01:02:44.841 --> 01:02:48.072
And don't let them
find you here when they come.

01:02:51.315 --> 01:02:53.283
We'll see you again...

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.544
...nigga.

01:03:11.468 --> 01:03:13.834
Ain't that a bitch, man?

01:03:32.022 --> 01:03:33.546
- How you doing?
- Gentlemen.

01:03:33.724 --> 01:03:35.282
What's happening?

01:04:03.153 --> 01:04:06.213
You always got some superfly shit.

01:04:08.225 --> 01:04:11.490
- How much you got?
- More than you need.

01:04:13.096 --> 01:04:15.291
What kind of cut can you take?

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:18.195
That snort you just had
was on a full.

01:04:19.302 --> 01:04:20.894
Damn.

01:04:21.204 --> 01:04:23.365
What kind of money
we talking about?

01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:31.308
- That much.
- Let's get it on.

01:04:48.498 --> 01:04:50.523
Okay, I'll see you later, man.

01:05:38.048 --> 01:05:41.381
Those friends of mine
want to buy a pound of coke.

01:05:44.788 --> 01:05:47.621
You know, baby, without being in it...

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:50.419
...you're about the best dealer I have.

01:05:51.428 --> 01:05:53.988
Oh, is that why you come up here?

01:05:54.164 --> 01:05:56.428
What kind of question is that?

01:05:56.767 --> 01:05:59.793
I mean it.
Why do you come here at all?

01:06:01.738 --> 01:06:05.230
- You know how I feel about you, Cynthia.
- No, I don't.

01:06:06.143 --> 01:06:07.633
I'd like to, though.

01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:10.678
I know exactly how I feel about you.

01:06:15.619 --> 01:06:17.314
All right.

01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:22.481
Look, I just finished
running down a fantastic number.

01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:24.593
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.025
I'm getting out of the life.

01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:30.222
You can't do that, Priest.

01:06:30.667 --> 01:06:32.532
You can't.

01:06:32.702 --> 01:06:35.364
You've got everything right here.

01:06:35.572 --> 01:06:38.598
I don't know what it has to do with me.
I have to get out.

01:06:38.775 --> 01:06:41.539
I have to change the way I live.

01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:44.771
Am I supposed to be part
of this big change?

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:48.083
All right, I'll lay it right on you.

01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:54.483
This whole number is something I thought
I wanted ever since I was a kid.

01:06:54.658 --> 01:06:57.252
My haul, my vines...

01:06:57.527 --> 01:07:00.018
...that wine you're drinking.

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:02.427
And a woman like you.

01:07:03.867 --> 01:07:06.563
Don't you feel that way anymore?

01:07:11.675 --> 01:07:13.472
I don't know.

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:22.810
Yes?

01:07:24.454 --> 01:07:28.185
Someone called "Scatter Man" downstairs.

01:07:32.028 --> 01:07:33.859
Send him up.

01:07:34.898 --> 01:07:36.798
Yes, send him up, please.

01:07:36.967 --> 01:07:38.457
Thank you.

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:50.209
When he comes, I gotta talk to
him alone, so go in the bedroom.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.282
- But this is my house.
- Just do what I tell you!

01:08:14.237 --> 01:08:17.104
- How'd you find this place?
- I don't mean to embarrass you...

01:08:17.274 --> 01:08:19.037
...but I'm running for my life.

01:08:19.209 --> 01:08:21.473
I need cash.

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:24.279
You're coming to me for bread, man?

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:29.212
You can't understand that shit, can you?

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:32.310
All the money Scatter done made?

01:08:33.089 --> 01:08:34.953
I owned that restaurant...

01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:37.593
...and damn near two square blocks.

01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:40.024
I caught myself getting late.

01:08:40.196 --> 01:08:42.926
Bank notes and mortgages.

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:46.666
Nothing but little pieces of paper.
Don't mean me no good now.

01:08:46.836 --> 01:08:48.394
What are you talking about?

01:08:48.571 --> 01:08:50.732
The man, he's trying to kill me.

01:08:50.907 --> 01:08:53.033
What man? You ain't making no sense.

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:56.939
The man you bought those keys from!

01:08:58.081 --> 01:09:00.140
He won't let me retire.

01:09:00.317 --> 01:09:02.649
And I trusted him.

01:09:05.154 --> 01:09:07.214
We came up together.

01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:12.256
I turned him on when he was nothing
but a rookie cop.

01:09:13.395 --> 01:09:16.694
He don't need me no more, man.
I know too much.

01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:18.390
Do you mean we both in trouble?

01:09:18.969 --> 01:09:21.767
Square up, nigga!

01:09:22.572 --> 01:09:28.602
You think if he's trying to kill me that he'll
let you out after you deal those 30 keys?

01:09:28.812 --> 01:09:30.973
He owns you now!

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:38.979
I don't know what you're gonna do,
Youngblood.

01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:46.560
What you gonna do?

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:49.325
Run.

01:09:49.698 --> 01:09:52.099
That's all I can do.

01:09:53.136 --> 01:09:56.970
- You let me have some money?
- Yeah, I got about 20,000 up at Georgia's.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.767
I can lay that on you.

01:09:58.942 --> 01:10:02.537
When you get somewhere, let me know.
I'll send you whatever you need.

01:10:02.712 --> 01:10:04.577
I'll need that 20,000 tonight.

01:10:04.748 --> 01:10:08.275
You meet me
at the East Side airline terminal at 2.

01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:10.180
Yeah, cool.

01:10:13.356 --> 01:10:15.847
This is all about the man.

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:17.820
Including his pictures.

01:10:17.994 --> 01:10:19.723
Now, his name is Reardon.

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:23.631
And there's some shit in there
about his family.

01:10:41.051 --> 01:10:42.882
Is he coming yet?

01:10:43.753 --> 01:10:45.448
Yeah, he's coming.

01:10:47.457 --> 01:10:49.482
He's coming, all right.

01:10:51.361 --> 01:10:53.659
Scatter, the skipper wants to see you.

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:57.994
- I ain't got time right now. I'm busy.
- Come on, let's go. We gotta talk.

01:12:04.334 --> 01:12:07.269
Look, my man, I mean,
the Scatter Man won't let you down.

01:12:07.437 --> 01:12:11.373
40,000, man! Please! Oh, don't kill me!

01:12:24.087 --> 01:12:27.420
Yeah, you motherfuckers did it,
didn't you?

01:12:27.724 --> 01:12:29.385
Yeah.

01:16:51.421 --> 01:16:53.355
What do you think
of Scatter OD'ing?

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:58.021
OD? Scatter didn't OD.
Somebody killed him.

01:16:58.194 --> 01:17:02.130
- Who do you think did it?
- Lot of people hated Scatter.

01:17:07.437 --> 01:17:09.667
How much stuff we got left now?

01:17:09.839 --> 01:17:12.467
About half a key
out on the street.

01:17:12.642 --> 01:17:16.806
- Let's take what we have now and split.
- Are you crazy?

01:17:16.979 --> 01:17:19.743
Now, you know damn well
who killed Scatter.

01:17:19.916 --> 01:17:22.749
Now, we fuck up, he'll kill us too.

01:17:23.519 --> 01:17:25.146
Besides...

01:17:25.321 --> 01:17:27.289
...we got it beat.

01:17:27.457 --> 01:17:29.254
We'll make a fortune.

01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:31.484
So don't rock the boat, man.

01:17:31.994 --> 01:17:34.986
It's worse now than it was before.

01:17:35.298 --> 01:17:38.825
Look, that man owns us.
You understand that, Eddie?

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:40.468
To him we're not real.

01:17:40.636 --> 01:17:42.934
He'll just use us and then kill us.

01:17:43.406 --> 01:17:46.898
Man, people been using me
all my life.

01:17:47.243 --> 01:17:48.540
Yeah.

01:17:48.711 --> 01:17:51.874
That honky's using me. So what?

01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:54.709
You know, I'm glad he's using me.

01:17:54.884 --> 01:17:58.376
Because I'm gonna make
a piss pot full of money.

01:17:58.554 --> 01:18:03.548
And I'm gonna live like a prince,
a fucking black prince!

01:18:03.759 --> 01:18:06.319
Yeah, this is the life.

01:18:06.596 --> 01:18:10.430
I could be nothing nowhere else.
And about his killing me?

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.830
Shit, I don't care.

01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:16.062
As long as he lets me live to be
an old motherfucker.

01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:20.141
And I ain't gonna do nothing
to make him kill me now.

01:18:20.743 --> 01:18:23.906
Suppose I could figure a way
out of this shit.

01:18:24.747 --> 01:18:26.544
I ain't going.

01:18:34.824 --> 01:18:36.553
Fill it.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:39.090
Why don't you fill it?

01:18:39.262 --> 01:18:43.494
Because I'm gonna keep my eye on you
every minute, Eddie.

01:20:46.155 --> 01:20:47.247
Right.

01:21:06.776 --> 01:21:08.403
He just left the apartment.

01:21:12.314 --> 01:21:13.804
Hold on.

01:21:15.051 --> 01:21:20.284
Lou, do me a favor. Send out a car right
now. I want you to pick up a guy for me.

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:33.593
- All his money's with him?
- I'm calling you, ain't I?

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.337
Get me the chief of detectives
on line two.

01:23:02.057 --> 01:23:04.218
185 to Central, K.

01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:10.295
<i>Lieutenant, one of our patrols</i>
<i>has picked up your male Negro suspect.</i>

01:23:10.466 --> 01:23:12.934
<i>And they got his briefcase too.</i>

01:23:15.638 --> 01:23:18.766
Good. Three detectives from my office
will go take custody.

01:23:18.941 --> 01:23:22.604
Have the patrolmen release
the prisoner to them. Get going.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.145
We'll hold him until then.

01:25:09.818 --> 01:25:11.615
Come on, let's talk.

01:25:15.925 --> 01:25:17.984
So you're Priest.

01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:22.588
I thought you were gonna be
the best dealer I ever had.

01:25:22.965 --> 01:25:26.093
What the hell
do you want to quit for?

01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:29.631
What else can you do?

01:25:29.805 --> 01:25:33.332
You're making more goddamn money
than you ever made in your life.

01:25:33.509 --> 01:25:37.536
You just wanna be
another two-bit black junkie.

01:25:44.787 --> 01:25:48.348
Well, I don't give a goddamn
where your head is.

01:25:48.657 --> 01:25:51.751
You're gonna work for me
until I tell you to quit.

01:25:51.927 --> 01:25:55.522
You don't own me, pig, and no
motherfucker tells me when I can split.

01:25:55.698 --> 01:25:59.156
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

01:26:00.269 --> 01:26:03.432
I'm talking to you, you redneck faggot.

01:27:07.202 --> 01:27:08.760
Freeze.

01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:15.299
You move a muscle, and I'll kill you.

01:27:15.477 --> 01:27:20.642
Kill me, Reardon. Kill me like you killed
Scatter, and you are one dead pig.

01:27:20.816 --> 01:27:22.647
What did you call me?

01:27:22.818 --> 01:27:26.276
Deputy Commissioner Reardon.
Yeah, that's right. I know your name.

01:27:26.455 --> 01:27:30.551
I know all about you. Your wife,
that big-legged daughter of yours...

01:27:30.726 --> 01:27:33.126
...and even that faggot son.

01:27:36.598 --> 01:27:38.828
Do it. Yeah, go ahead.

01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:41.128
I'm to the point I ain't afraid to die.

01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:44.170
But you kill me,
you and your whole fucking family die.

01:27:44.339 --> 01:27:47.570
- That's bullshit.
- I ain't bullshitting you, captain.

01:27:47.743 --> 01:27:53.443
I took a $ 100,000 contract
out on your life, your wife, everybody.

01:27:53.615 --> 01:27:55.674
You'll all be hit if I die.

01:27:55.851 --> 01:27:59.912
Yeah, if I choke on a chicken bone,
all the Reardons is dead.

01:28:00.556 --> 01:28:03.582
You ain't got $ 100,000.

01:28:03.759 --> 01:28:05.659
Not anymore.

01:28:21.343 --> 01:28:24.744
Offering to do my dirty laundry
ain't gonna help you.

01:28:25.948 --> 01:28:30.851
All them honky pig partners you got ain't
gonna be able to protect your ass, either.

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.881
Because...

01:28:33.055 --> 01:28:37.048
...case you think I'm pulling some
of that old-time nigga shit on you...

01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:41.754
...I think you ought to know something.
I hired the very best killers there are.

01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:44.660
White killers. White ones, baby.

01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.233
So you better take good care of me.

01:28:47.402 --> 01:28:52.806
Nothing, nothing better happen to one hair
on my gorgeous head. Can you dig it?

01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:22.779
