ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.958
ANY SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL EVENTS,
PERSONS, OR ORGANIZATIONS

00:10.041 --> 00:10.916
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:36.375 --> 00:39.833
Why did I have to leave
that box of cakes at Jaitham?

00:39.916 --> 00:41.083
You could have done it.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.916
That was just training.

00:44.625 --> 00:48.250
Now you know who your friends are
inside Jaitham, don't you?

00:50.291 --> 00:52.791
Was Jo working with Aod?

00:52.875 --> 00:55.541
Don't make stupid assumptions.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.166
Aod is a rookie.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.458
Jo was higher up. Same level as me.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.125
That's not true.

01:02.750 --> 01:03.958
Believe what you want.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.750
But one thing is for sure.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.541
You have to work for me.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.458
Can I ask you for a favor?

01:16.041 --> 01:18.083
Tell me to do whatever you want,

01:18.666 --> 01:20.916
but promise to leave my parents alone.

01:21.000 --> 01:21.833
My goodness.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.958
You're such a hero. I like you.

01:26.875 --> 01:27.708
Hold on.

01:32.041 --> 01:32.875
Look.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.875
<i>-How are you, Wanchai?
-Hi.</i>

01:35.958 --> 01:39.208
-<i>Wanchai.</i>
-Dad, Mom, are you okay?

01:39.291 --> 01:42.458
<i>We're fine. We're just eating.
Kiew bought food for us.</i>

01:42.541 --> 01:44.333
<i>Kiew has been good to us.</i>

01:44.916 --> 01:48.125
<i>We saw the news about you on TV.</i>

01:48.791 --> 01:50.583
<i>You're awesome.</i>

01:50.666 --> 01:53.875
-<i>I agree with that.</i>
-Hey, Kiew.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.125
<i>Yes?</i>

01:55.208 --> 01:57.666
Take good care of his parents,

01:57.750 --> 01:59.750
and don't forget
to wire the money tomorrow.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.041
<i>I'll do that.</i>

02:01.125 --> 02:02.750
I'm going now.

02:06.541 --> 02:07.375
See?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.541
Your life suddenly improved.

02:11.125 --> 02:14.708
Come on. You can pay off
your parents' debt in installments.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.875
You can rest easy now.
Kiew is taking good care of your parents.

02:34.583 --> 02:35.625
I'll see you later, honey.

03:19.083 --> 03:22.250
Please follow her inside.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.750
This way, please.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.125
Excuse me.

03:34.666 --> 03:35.583
Hello.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.708
How may I help you?

03:42.916 --> 03:45.208
Someone told me
to meet them here at this time.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.125
Please follow me.

05:02.000 --> 05:02.833
Have a seat.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.416
Why did you want to see me?

05:16.916 --> 05:18.291
Why did you send me a photo of Jo?

05:21.875 --> 05:24.333
Now I can see that you are Jo's brother.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.708
You have the same eyes.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.625
You're dirty like him from work too.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.541
You were at the funeral.

05:50.666 --> 05:52.041
What's your relationship with Jo?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.583
The night you arrived in Bangkok,

06:00.291 --> 06:02.541
Jo told me he was going to pick you up.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.041
Were you with Jo?

06:06.875 --> 06:10.166
Jo texted me that night
saying he needed help urgently.

06:10.791 --> 06:11.875
Do you know

06:12.625 --> 06:13.708
what the problem was?

06:19.666 --> 06:21.583
Thida, he's here.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.083
Excuse me.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.083
You asked me what Jo's problem was.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.458
I was Jo's problem.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.833
Thank you.

07:26.000 --> 07:26.833
What's up?

07:28.041 --> 07:29.500
How did you end up
as Hardcore's new gofer?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.250
My brother

07:32.583 --> 07:33.833
used to work with Hardcore.

07:36.125 --> 07:39.958
My family has money problems,
so I have to work for him.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.541
Let me give you some advice.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.166
For now, focus on earning a living.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.166
They're friends with the top brass.

07:50.250 --> 07:54.750
They have connections
with some powerful fucking people.

07:55.333 --> 07:59.250
Especially now that Hardcore says
there will be more frequent shipments.

07:59.833 --> 08:03.125
The more there is, the riskier it gets.
We need to help each other out.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.416
We're buddies, right?

08:09.416 --> 08:11.583
Come on.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.166
Fine.

08:32.666 --> 08:35.708
Here are the three
main principles of a rescue.

08:35.791 --> 08:36.708
Scene size-up.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.333
Assess the safety at the scene.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.291
Once we've evaluated the risk,

08:41.375 --> 08:43.166
we enter the second phase which is PPE.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.791
Most importantly,
we only have four minutes.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.250
Four golden minutes

08:48.333 --> 08:52.041
before the patient suffers a cerebral
infarction. We must save them in time.

08:53.750 --> 08:54.708
Wanchai.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.750
That's a good time.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.708
<i>Rescuing isn't just a job.</i>

09:04.291 --> 09:06.916
<i>Most people do it because they enjoy it.</i>

09:07.000 --> 09:09.583
<i>Also, everyone likes it
for a different reason.</i>

09:10.625 --> 09:13.333
<i>I like it because it gives
my life some value.</i>

09:13.416 --> 09:17.333
<i>I guess you could call it atonement
for the bad things I did in the past.</i>

09:20.250 --> 09:22.166
<i>As for the work with Hardcore,</i>

09:22.916 --> 09:26.916
<i>we distribute counterfeit money
from the source to different outlets.</i>

09:30.125 --> 09:33.083
<i>Hardcore is working
with the best manufacturers,</i>

09:33.708 --> 09:34.916
<i>making all sorts of currencies.</i>

09:35.458 --> 09:37.958
<i>For Thai banknotes,
the focus is on smaller notes.</i>

09:38.041 --> 09:40.208
<i>People don't really check them.</i>

09:40.291 --> 09:43.875
<i>This means quantities are huge.
We have to use large-capacity vehicles.</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:47.666
<i>Also, Hardcore does not
put all his eggs in one basket.</i>

09:48.583 --> 09:50.791
Keep moving. Move along.

09:50.875 --> 09:51.708
Shit.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.125
-Stop, please.
-Yes, sir.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.166
A rescue vehicle from a foundation

09:55.916 --> 09:57.833
isn't suspicious. Cops don't check them.

09:57.916 --> 09:59.916
Aren't you that hero, Wanchai?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.208
-It is you.
-You know him?

10:02.291 --> 10:05.458
-Take your time.
-Smile a little. One, two, three.

10:05.541 --> 10:07.833
-Have a safe journey.
-Thank you so much.

10:07.916 --> 10:09.041
See you.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.208
We do all this

10:16.291 --> 10:19.250
behind Sak's back.
What happens if he finds out?

10:19.333 --> 10:21.375
To be honest, he's like my dad.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.833
<i>I wouldn't do it if I didn't have to,</i>

10:24.916 --> 10:26.208
<i>but I have no choice.</i>

10:29.000 --> 10:31.833
<i>Mom, I've transferred
some money to your account.</i>

10:31.916 --> 10:33.083
How is Dad doing?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.583
He's having a beer with Kiew out front.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.125
You can't trust Kiew.

10:38.208 --> 10:41.666
<i>Have you thought it through
before getting involved in this?</i>

10:42.500 --> 10:46.041
You won't find a high-paying job
like this anywhere else.

10:48.708 --> 10:52.291
<i>I believe my brother's death
was suspicious.</i>

10:53.208 --> 10:56.333
<i>I'm determined to find out
what really happened.</i>

11:02.041 --> 11:05.791
ENTER PASSCODE

11:07.291 --> 11:12.583
Muay, please tell me
in my dream what your passcode is.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.166
"I'm not dead yet, Kat," says Muay.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.000
You were in the front?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.458
-It's okay.
-Hey.

11:25.541 --> 11:26.375
Mai.

11:27.583 --> 11:28.791
Are you okay?

11:28.875 --> 11:34.041
How am I going to pay
for my house and car this month?

11:34.666 --> 11:36.041
I'll help you.

11:36.625 --> 11:37.625
Give me a hug.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.375
Good luck, Mai.

11:40.458 --> 11:41.375
-Good luck, Mai.
-Good luck.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.375
Damn. Another one gone.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.375
Hey.

11:52.750 --> 11:53.583
See you.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.583
Let's go.

11:57.666 --> 12:00.333
MATIMUANCHON

12:01.958 --> 12:03.958
-I'm hungry.
-Me too. I want to eat--

12:04.041 --> 12:07.500
Chai, what brings you here?

12:08.000 --> 12:08.833
This.

12:09.833 --> 12:10.791
MS. NAPATSANAN JITMUNGMUN, REPORTER
EDITORIAL TEAM AT MATIMUANCHON

12:12.208 --> 12:13.583
That's my business card.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.000
Kat.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.583
Can you spare some time?

12:19.583 --> 12:21.958
I'm going out on a job.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.958
-Right.
-I…

12:26.041 --> 12:27.083
Do you want to join us?

12:30.083 --> 12:30.916
Chai.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.083
-Yes, please.
-Yes?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.166
Well.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.958
The job suddenly got interesting, right?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.000
So…

12:47.666 --> 12:50.625
Why don't we get going?

12:50.708 --> 12:54.625
-Let's get to work. Together.
-Okay.

12:54.708 --> 12:55.916
-Sure.
-Let's all go.

12:57.708 --> 13:02.041
Are you sure they're still in there?

13:02.666 --> 13:05.750
Hey, my contact at the checkout said

13:06.333 --> 13:09.833
they were wandering
around the shop hand in hand.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.125
How long does it take to buy condoms?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.666
You want to borrow a condom?

13:14.625 --> 13:16.791
-Shut up, asshole.
-What?

13:17.291 --> 13:18.416
Damn you.

13:18.958 --> 13:22.125
All right. You should
watch your mouth in front of Wanchai.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.041
I'm sorry.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.583
-You must be bored doing this.
-It's okay.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.916
This is a new experience.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.291
Actually, I don't know many celebrities.

13:39.291 --> 13:43.083
You two keep on chatting.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.250
Get cozy. I'll be right back.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.875
What are you talking about?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.750
Hey, where are you going?

13:58.958 --> 14:00.833
-Kat.
-Yes?

14:01.416 --> 14:02.708
About your colleague

14:03.416 --> 14:06.000
that had information on Ruampalangjai…

14:06.583 --> 14:09.375
Have you seen the word "Hard"

14:09.958 --> 14:11.833
or "Hardcore" in her files?

14:13.750 --> 14:14.958
It doesn't ring a bell.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.208
What does it mean?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.250
It's a person's name.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.875
That's strange. Someone at Ruampalangjai?

14:24.625 --> 14:25.791
Not really.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.458
I think there must be
lots of information on Muay's phone,

14:32.458 --> 14:33.750
but I can't get into it.

14:39.166 --> 14:40.375
Wanchai.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.958
If it were you, how would you
set your phone's passcode?

14:47.500 --> 14:50.833
When I was young,
I set all my passcodes to 1111.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.583
Why?

14:55.041 --> 14:56.083
My name is Wan.

14:59.958 --> 15:03.958
One, one, one, one. Chai.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.291
Right?

15:10.708 --> 15:12.458
-Really?
-Yes.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.250
That's cute.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.208
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.291
It's fine.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.375
Who on earth would know
someone else's passcode?

15:27.208 --> 15:28.750
Especially someone like Muay.

15:32.875 --> 15:33.875
My goodness.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.208
The sirens are ear-piercing.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.458
How do rescuers endure it?

15:43.625 --> 15:44.958
I'm getting used to it.

15:45.791 --> 15:47.791
It's like when I'm with the rescue team

15:47.875 --> 15:51.541
and we suddenly get a call
over the radio from 1669.

I got in.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.291
Right.

16:06.875 --> 16:07.875
I'm sorry.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.500
This is all thanks to you.

16:14.041 --> 16:14.958

Wow.

INFORMANT, NEWS, AWAITING RELEASE

<i>At least 20,000 casualties a year,</i>

<i>This number might sound
shocking and depressing,</i>

<i>but what's more depressing is</i>

16:44.750 --> 16:50.333
<i>these accidents and deaths

16:50.416 --> 16:55.416
<i>by rescue workers and volunteers such as

17:58.791 --> 18:02.750
taking a swipe
at Ruampalangjai Foundation.

18:05.416 --> 18:08.833
I feel uneasy about this news.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.166
My apologies, ma'am.

18:30.583 --> 18:31.500
TPR REPORTER:
WILL YOU GIVE ME THE INFO?

18:32.416 --> 18:33.416
Muay.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.708
I'm sorry

18:36.750 --> 18:40.333
for sharing your video
without your permission.

18:55.416 --> 18:56.583
I promise you

18:58.375 --> 19:00.916
I'll make sure the public
becomes aware of this.

19:01.958 --> 19:02.791
Shit.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.875
I'm sorry, Muay.

19:17.541 --> 19:21.250
<i>Sorry I've been silent.
I will have new information for you soon.</i>

19:24.291 --> 19:26.791
I tried to infiltrate the rescue team.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.375
I think I might have struck gold.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.291
Who is it, Muay?

19:38.166 --> 19:39.416
Okay, it's done.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.416
Let me test it first.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.833
It's sturdy.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.833
Thank you both so much for helping me.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.000
Thank you, everyone.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.375
I promise I'll practice walking.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.375
RESCUE TEAM JAITHAM FOUNDATION

19:56.041 --> 19:57.625
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.500
Use your legs.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.208
What? All right.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.916
-Take your time.
-Okay.

20:11.875 --> 20:12.708
He's here.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.791
-Mom, Gift is here.
-Hello, Phen.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.041
Hello.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.333
Hello, sir.

20:31.375 --> 20:35.375
What food did you buy, Cheep? I'm hungry.

20:35.958 --> 20:37.250
It's from your favorite place.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.541
Tom yum and stir-fried vegetables.

20:39.625 --> 20:40.833
Your favorites.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.250
It sounds delicious.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.916
You tell your son, Cheep,

20:47.541 --> 20:49.541
to stay away from my daughter.

20:56.791 --> 20:57.666
Have you any idea…

20:59.250 --> 21:01.041
how your getting involved with her

21:02.541 --> 21:04.333
affects me?

21:06.416 --> 21:08.291
I have a name, you know.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.708
Get her out of my house right now.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.958
This is my house and Mom's too.

21:13.833 --> 21:17.291
When you were in jail,
who took care of Mom?

21:17.375 --> 21:19.708
-Who took care of the house?
-How dare you say that?

21:19.791 --> 21:21.625
Shouldn't you at least thank me?

21:21.708 --> 21:23.250
Enough. Will you both calm down?

21:24.375 --> 21:26.250
If you won't stay away from her,

21:28.041 --> 21:30.916
don't come to the foundation
anymore. Get out!

21:32.083 --> 21:34.250
Let's go, Cheep.
We don't have to listen to this.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.500
You see this? My dad's

21:41.083 --> 21:42.416
love fades with time.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.458
He only cares about
himself and his damn pride.

21:46.541 --> 21:48.208
Cheep!

21:48.291 --> 21:49.458
-Cheep!
-Cheep!

21:49.541 --> 21:50.958
Leave and don't come back.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.166
Can I ask,

22:01.041 --> 22:02.791
do you have a problem with Pratheep?

22:08.250 --> 22:09.958
When I was being prosecuted…

22:18.125 --> 22:18.958
Sorry.

22:20.250 --> 22:23.541
I promised Phen that
I would stop bringing up the past.

22:30.375 --> 22:31.291
Are you okay?

22:38.041 --> 22:38.875
Excuse me.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.875
-Hello?
-<i>Sorry to bother you, Mr. Wanchai.</i>

22:46.958 --> 22:48.666
I'm Mr. Wat's secretary.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.083
What's the matter?

22:50.166 --> 22:53.666
<i>Mr. Wat would like to invite you
to join him on his hospital visit</i>

22:53.750 --> 22:56.416
<i>to see the victims
of the accident at the bus terminal.</i>

22:59.375 --> 23:03.583
<i>I plan to share
this information on social media</i>

23:03.666 --> 23:06.708
<i>because my employers
would never let me go this far.</i>

23:06.791 --> 23:08.375
-She's out of her mind.
<i>-I think</i>

23:08.458 --> 23:10.708
<i>the public needs to know about this.</i>

23:32.666 --> 23:33.791
Have a seat, Mr. Artorn.

23:39.541 --> 23:41.208
You know about the video, right?

23:41.875 --> 23:44.166
-I was just watching it.
-You were?

23:44.250 --> 23:47.416
-Good. I can spare you the details then.
-Yes.

23:49.416 --> 23:51.458
You told me you would control Kat.

23:52.916 --> 23:54.666
It's obvious you can't do it.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.083
Will you please inform Kat that

23:58.875 --> 24:00.500
she's suspended as of today?

24:01.083 --> 24:03.291
If her attitude doesn't change,
she needn't come back.

24:06.625 --> 24:07.500
Mr. Wee.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.333
We can't afford
any more damage to our image.

24:23.916 --> 24:25.000
You understand, don't you?

24:27.625 --> 24:29.416
Okay. Yes.

25:05.083 --> 25:09.541
A little something from Wattanakarn.
I'm Wattana. You can call me Wat.

25:09.625 --> 25:12.125
Good luck to both of you.

25:12.208 --> 25:15.541
-Next.
-The next patient is one of our staff.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.708
-His name is Ta.
-Ta? Okay, thank you.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.583
-Ta, it's Mr. Wat here. Hello.
-Hello.

25:20.666 --> 25:25.041
Don't worry about your work.
You can put it on hold.

25:25.125 --> 25:27.916
As for the expenses,
I'll take care of them.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.250
I'm really sorry this happened to you.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.041
Here's a little something
from Wattanakarn Company.

25:34.125 --> 25:35.291
-Mr. Wat.
-Yes?

25:35.375 --> 25:37.958
-Can we do an interview now?
-Of course.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.291
-Can we interview you?
-Yes.

25:39.375 --> 25:41.375
-Do I look okay?
-You're good.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.291
Okay?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.500
Gather around, please.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.666
Greetings to everyone from the press.

25:48.541 --> 25:51.500
I came here today on behalf
of Wattanakarn Company

25:51.583 --> 25:55.875
not only to offer help
and encouragement to the injured

25:55.958 --> 25:59.708
who have been hospitalized here
at Tawanvej Hospital,

25:59.791 --> 26:01.375
owned by Dr. Tawan,

26:01.458 --> 26:06.583
but I also have two surprises for you.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.166
The surprises I have for you…

26:10.750 --> 26:12.333
Speak of the devil.

26:12.416 --> 26:14.500
-My first surprise.
-This way, please.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.833
-Mr. Wanchai.
-He's here now.

26:16.916 --> 26:19.916
My reporter friends, you must
remember this young man.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
He was courageous and selfless

26:22.083 --> 26:26.000
during the recent fire.

26:26.083 --> 26:30.166
Please give a round of applause to welcome
our real hero, Mr. Wanchai Praisoong.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.708
It's people like Wanchai, dear press,

26:36.791 --> 26:40.416
that I truly believe
to be the heroes and the inspiration

26:40.500 --> 26:43.333
that our present society longs for.

26:43.416 --> 26:47.375
I'd like to ask Mr. Wanchai to say a few
words to the press. The floor is yours.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.791
Go ahead. Come closer.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.291
-What do you have to say?
-How do you feel?

26:52.375 --> 26:53.833
Do your best, Chai.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.500
-Please look at the camera.
-It was very recent.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.333
Please speak when you're ready.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.958
These people may think they ended up here

27:04.041 --> 27:05.666
in this condition

27:07.041 --> 27:08.041
because of my brother.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.125
I'm devastated by what happened.

27:22.583 --> 27:24.291
They all deserve justice.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.708
The wrongdoers should be punished.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.458
This also applies to my brother.

27:35.791 --> 27:38.125
I believe that my brother was innocent.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.750
Thank you, Wanchai.

27:39.833 --> 27:45.041
Excuse me, but I don't want
to take up too much of your time.

27:45.125 --> 27:48.583
Let's now discuss my special campaign.

27:48.666 --> 27:52.583
This campaign is focused
on reducing traffic accidents

27:52.666 --> 27:56.875
to prepare for the Seven Deadly Days
over the Songkran period.

27:57.458 --> 28:02.208
I'd like to take this opportunity
to present my final surprise.

28:02.291 --> 28:05.958
I would like to ask Mr. Wanchai Praisoong

28:06.041 --> 28:08.791
to be the face of this campaign.

28:08.875 --> 28:14.000
Please give a hand to the new face
of Wattanakarn, Wanchai Praisoong.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.833
Give him a round of applause.

28:16.958 --> 28:17.916
Let's have a picture.

28:19.541 --> 28:20.500
This way, Wanchai.

28:21.291 --> 28:22.791
-Doctor, come here.
-Okay.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.166
This camera please, Wanchai.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.000
-Over here.
-This camera, please.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.291
-Smile.
-Smile, please.

28:35.750 --> 28:40.208
<i>A total of 12 people died
and over 30 were injured.</i>

28:40.750 --> 28:43.125
<i>Today, at Tawanvej Hospital,</i>

28:43.208 --> 28:47.000
<i>Mr. Wat Auajitsamran
from Wattanakarn Company</i>

28:47.083 --> 28:49.166
<i>visited and donated money</i>

28:49.250 --> 28:53.250
<i>to the victims of the accident
that occurred at the bus terminal</i>

28:53.333 --> 28:56.416
<i>-before making a surprise announcement.
-Get well soon.</i>

28:56.500 --> 28:58.791
MILLIONAIRE WAT VISITS CAR CRASH VICTIMS

28:58.875 --> 29:02.833
<i>Please give a round of applause to welcome
our real hero, Mr. Wanchai Praisoong.</i>

29:15.125 --> 29:18.333
I saw the news about you
working for Wattanakarn.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.541
He caught me off guard.

29:26.916 --> 29:29.833
Are you thinking about your brother?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.083
I hadn't seen my brother for a long time.

29:37.875 --> 29:40.416
When I was a kid, he was my hero.

29:41.958 --> 29:45.000
I thought coming to Bangkok
would bring us closer.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.458
After the accident,

29:48.625 --> 29:51.791
I couldn't help wondering what kind
of person my brother really was.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.208
Was he still my hero?

29:58.250 --> 30:01.958
Since I found out
he worked for Ruampalangjai…

30:07.833 --> 30:09.333
Let's not jump to conclusions.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.875
People can change.

30:13.875 --> 30:18.416
But I believe that deep down
we are still the same person.

30:19.625 --> 30:20.458
Okay.

30:22.458 --> 30:27.333
Sometimes, people do things
that others can't understand,

30:29.041 --> 30:31.083
but I'm certain that Jo had a good heart.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.416
That would never change.

30:42.708 --> 30:47.583
<i>On the expanding horizon</i>

30:48.458 --> 30:52.500
<i>The city of our dreams</i>

30:54.708 --> 30:59.458
<i>Long hidden confusion</i>

31:00.291 --> 31:04.583
<i>It's a lively stream</i>

31:06.458 --> 31:11.083
<i>To reach the beauty</i>

31:12.125 --> 31:16.166
<i>You ask if I'm happy</i>

31:18.041 --> 31:22.708
<i>Carrying confusion, chaos</i>

31:23.541 --> 31:26.833
<i>Loaded with memories</i>

31:28.250 --> 31:31.083
By the way,
can I talk to you about something?

31:31.666 --> 31:34.791
If I wanted to create a webpage

31:34.875 --> 31:38.208
to expose the corruption
inside Ruampalangjai,

31:38.291 --> 31:40.083
as Muay set out to do,

31:40.166 --> 31:42.791
do you think I could do it?

31:43.375 --> 31:45.500
Why not? Of course, you could.

31:45.583 --> 31:46.541
Really?

31:48.416 --> 31:50.333
Will you help me?

31:51.166 --> 31:52.916
How can I help you? I…

31:53.833 --> 31:55.375
I'm no good with the Internet.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.375
It's okay.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.416
I'll show you an example.
What I have in mind is…

32:03.333 --> 32:06.166
What the hell?

32:07.458 --> 32:09.416
The battery is dead.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.166
Can I borrow your phone?

32:14.166 --> 32:15.166
Here you are.

32:16.875 --> 32:17.708
Thank you.

32:21.083 --> 32:25.291
THIDA: I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.
LET'S NOT CONTACT EACH OTHER AGAIN.

32:30.791 --> 32:31.833
You got a text.

32:37.208 --> 32:40.125
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.
LET'S NOT CONTACT EACH OTHER AGAIN.

32:54.458 --> 32:58.166
I'm snapping away.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.541
We might catch a love scene.

33:03.375 --> 33:05.666
-Speaking of ice cream…
-Mr. Wee is calling.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.375
I'll meet you in the car.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.791
Okay. I'll be right there.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.791
Hello. You should be happy

33:21.375 --> 33:25.333
because I'm now acting
like a paparazzi to get photos for you.

33:25.416 --> 33:28.791
<i>Kat, take a break from work for now.</i>

33:30.083 --> 33:32.416
Why? Do you have another job for me?

33:32.500 --> 33:36.000
No. I mean, take some time off.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.750
Mr. Artorn ordered it.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.541
<i>If you can't fix your attitude,
don't come back.</i>

33:45.833 --> 33:46.666
<i>Kat.</i>

33:47.750 --> 33:48.583
<i>Ka--</i>

33:59.041 --> 34:00.000
Damn it.

34:21.666 --> 34:25.125
I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.666
KAT: I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.750
WANCHAI: SOMETHING URGENT
CAME UP. I'LL CALL YOU.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.291
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

35:19.333 --> 35:20.166
Hurry up.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.791
Hey, quickly.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.541
This stuff is hot.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.166
What?

35:40.125 --> 35:41.166
Hi, guys.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.750
What are you doing in the dark?

35:46.208 --> 35:47.333
I forgot something.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.708
We're heading back to the underpass.

35:49.791 --> 35:50.750
-Right.
-Let's go.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.458
What do you have there?

35:54.666 --> 35:56.958
-What?
-There's no hurry.

35:57.041 --> 35:58.208
What?

35:59.666 --> 36:00.500
What?

36:01.375 --> 36:04.375
We're delaying your delivery, aren't we?

36:05.333 --> 36:07.666
What are you talking about?

36:07.750 --> 36:10.750
Let me see what's in your bag then.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.791
Hey, Pipo.

36:19.875 --> 36:21.708
This doesn't seem relevant to rescue work.

36:32.750 --> 36:33.750
Listen to me.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.916
You and Pipo can't join us.
It's too dangerous.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.916
You listen to me.

36:41.708 --> 36:45.333
Po and I need the money,
just like you two do.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.875
I know that Sak doesn't like it,

36:48.458 --> 36:50.250
but my family is in serious trouble.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.708
Same for Po.

36:52.291 --> 36:53.708
We both need the money urgently.

36:55.458 --> 36:57.458
I don't want to do this to Sak.

36:58.458 --> 37:01.291
We've agreed that we'll only
do it temporarily to make some cash,

37:01.958 --> 37:03.416
and then we'll quit.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.916
Why is it so damn hard
for you two to understand?

37:07.458 --> 37:10.541
The problem is the people we work for.

37:11.125 --> 37:13.708
You can't just tell them
how long you want to work for.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.500
It's not like you can just quit.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.583
Chai is right.

37:18.666 --> 37:21.250
Don't get involved with this shit.

37:22.125 --> 37:25.666
If Sak finds out what you two
have been up to, what will he say?

37:25.750 --> 37:27.666
Come on now.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.958
Are you blackmailing us?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.625
How about this?

37:40.458 --> 37:41.583
You stay out of it.

37:42.958 --> 37:43.958
You too, Pipo.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.708
Aod and I will split the money with you.

37:48.791 --> 37:49.625
Hey.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.541
Just promise me that you won't tell Sak.

37:55.250 --> 37:57.083
-I'm begging you.
-Come on, Chai.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.458
Deal?

38:03.125 --> 38:04.083
Come on.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.125
Fine.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.333
-Get out.
-What?

38:40.416 --> 38:41.541
Let go!

38:50.500 --> 38:51.333
Let's go.

39:00.750 --> 39:01.791
Chai.

39:03.750 --> 39:06.208
I hope you haven't
made a mistake involving those two.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.583
If there's a problem,
I'll take responsibility.

39:14.125 --> 39:17.500
-Let's go.
-Better step on it. We're late.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.125
Let go of me.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.875
Aod, pull over.

39:45.958 --> 39:48.833
-Chai, what are you doing?
-It's Kat's car.

39:48.916 --> 39:50.958
Don't. We'll be late, Chai.

39:51.041 --> 39:52.583
-You go ahead.
-What are you doing?

39:52.666 --> 39:55.750
-I'll be right behind you.
-Are you sure?

40:11.291 --> 40:14.458
Do you want to die?

40:36.291 --> 40:38.750
Fuck off, asshole.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.333
-Run.
-What the hell?

40:40.916 --> 40:41.791
Assholes.

40:43.833 --> 40:44.666
Kat.

40:57.875 --> 40:58.708
Kat.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.916
Kat.

41:03.416 --> 41:05.458
Don't be scared. You're safe now.

41:05.541 --> 41:06.958
It's me, Wanchai.

41:10.958 --> 41:12.458
You're safe now, Kat.

41:15.875 --> 41:16.875
The doctor said…

41:19.208 --> 41:20.458
you're not seriously hurt.

41:46.791 --> 41:48.833
Do you think I'm in over my head?

41:53.666 --> 41:55.375
It doesn't matter if you are or not.

41:59.375 --> 42:00.708
You're strong, Kat.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.791
Shit, I'm late.

42:24.666 --> 42:26.250
She can walk on her own now, Mom.

42:29.750 --> 42:30.666
Who's that?

42:32.166 --> 42:33.291
Oh, hey.

42:33.791 --> 42:34.625
Slowly.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.541
What is it?

42:40.958 --> 42:41.791
What's wrong?

42:42.541 --> 42:45.541
Come here. Sit down. What's wrong?

42:45.625 --> 42:47.375
Come and sit down.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.291
What's going on?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.583
Kat was attacked.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.791
We just came from the hospital.

42:58.708 --> 42:59.791
Don't tell me

43:00.666 --> 43:02.583
this was done by Ruampalangjai?

43:03.791 --> 43:06.458
How could they do something like that?

43:08.875 --> 43:10.833
I fear for Kat's safety.

43:10.916 --> 43:11.750
Right.

43:12.458 --> 43:16.125
We have a small room upstairs.
If it's okay with you,

43:17.250 --> 43:19.000
you can stay here tonight.

43:20.125 --> 43:21.791
It's safer here.

43:26.458 --> 43:28.916
Mom, I'm staying
at a friend's house tonight.

43:30.291 --> 43:31.666
I have a lot of work on.

43:33.833 --> 43:34.833
Be careful.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.875
Okay. Bye, Mom.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.166
The room is a bit small.

43:41.750 --> 43:42.583
Here.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.250
I just cleaned it up yesterday, though.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.500
Will you be okay?

43:50.166 --> 43:51.208
I'll be fine.

43:51.291 --> 43:54.666
Po actually sleeps here occasionally.

43:55.166 --> 43:59.041
There's a fridge
in the kitchen downstairs.

43:59.125 --> 44:03.208
There's water and food.
Take whatever you want.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.583
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

44:07.958 --> 44:10.291
-Make yourself at home.
-Yes, ma'am.

44:10.375 --> 44:12.166
-I'm going downstairs.
-Thank you.

44:34.833 --> 44:37.125
I'll go get your car for you.

44:40.666 --> 44:45.541
That car might be old,
but it's quite sturdy.

44:51.458 --> 44:52.541
Chai.

44:56.083 --> 44:57.375
I've made up my mind.

45:02.625 --> 45:04.041
I won't give up.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.333
Don't worry.

45:16.458 --> 45:17.500
For the time being,

45:19.000 --> 45:20.291
I'll help with the investigation.

45:22.125 --> 45:24.750
You should lie low in the meantime.

45:26.666 --> 45:28.291
But you'll be in danger too.

45:31.166 --> 45:34.833
Seeing your determination,
I'm willing to take the risk.

45:59.041 --> 46:00.208
Thank you.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.791
There are no two ways about it.

46:37.750 --> 46:41.083
The allegations my colleague
was planning to reveal

46:42.708 --> 46:44.375
seem to be well-founded.

46:50.833 --> 46:53.500
<i>They sent someone to threaten me today.</i>

46:55.750 --> 46:57.541
They were trying to scare me…

47:01.166 --> 47:03.500
into keeping my head down
and my mouth shut.

47:11.625 --> 47:13.333
<i>But today, I made up my mind.</i>

47:15.375 --> 47:16.416
<i>I</i>

47:17.625 --> 47:19.083
am going to stand up to them.

47:26.916 --> 47:27.875
We'll see,

47:29.041 --> 47:32.291
other than abducting a girl
and beating her up,

47:34.291 --> 47:35.458
what else they can do.

47:46.666 --> 47:48.375
Po, I can't see it.

47:49.583 --> 47:51.250
-I don't want glasses.
-Better?

47:51.333 --> 47:53.500
-That's too far.
-Here.

47:55.041 --> 47:55.875
Hey.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.083
What?

48:00.083 --> 48:01.833
I'm so pissed.

48:01.916 --> 48:03.958
What? Where's Chai?

48:05.458 --> 48:07.625
-I don't know.
-What the hell?

48:08.500 --> 48:09.625
Seriously.

48:11.041 --> 48:11.875
Here he is.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.875
What's wrong?

48:17.625 --> 48:19.583
I'm not delivering alone again.

48:20.166 --> 48:23.000
-I'm sorry.
-I almost didn't make it in time.

48:23.083 --> 48:24.833
Forget it. It's okay.

48:28.625 --> 48:31.625
INCOMING CALL FROM HC.

48:34.125 --> 48:37.291
-Hello?
<i>-Fucker. You were late with your delivery.</i>

48:39.666 --> 48:40.875
But I delivered it.

48:40.958 --> 48:43.916
<i>Because you were late, they had to hurry.</i>

48:44.000 --> 48:47.291
<i>You know what?
They crashed. The car's wrecked.</i>

48:47.375 --> 48:48.666
<i>Go take care of that.</i>

48:49.291 --> 48:50.958
<i>Get my goods back.</i>

48:52.083 --> 48:55.791
<i>Call for rescuers near the DBD.
A car has rolled. There are injuries.</i>

48:55.875 --> 48:56.708
We're fucked.

48:57.416 --> 48:58.833
Chai, wait. Hurry.

48:59.833 --> 49:01.250
Sak.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.041
Can I go with you?

49:07.875 --> 49:08.708
Hop in.

49:20.625 --> 49:21.875
My leg.

49:28.500 --> 49:32.166
MOBILE AMBULANCE CENTER

49:40.708 --> 49:44.375
Sir, I'm from the Jaitham Foundation.
You're okay now.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.916
Sir, stay with me.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.500
We are here to help you.

49:54.958 --> 49:56.000
We're here.

49:58.916 --> 49:59.791
I can't take it.

50:00.375 --> 50:01.750
Chai, hurry up.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.750
Wanchai!

50:05.083 --> 50:06.958
-Wanchai.
-Open the bag, Po.

50:07.041 --> 50:08.666
Bua, Pipo, check on the injured.

50:08.750 --> 50:10.541
Aod, ice bucket.

50:10.625 --> 50:12.916
-Yes, sir.
-Po, call for an ambulance.

50:13.000 --> 50:13.833
On it.

50:17.958 --> 50:19.000
I called.

50:20.916 --> 50:22.583
Can we stop the bleeding?

50:23.541 --> 50:24.416
One, two, three.

50:32.875 --> 50:34.541
Control, do you copy? Fifteen here.

50:34.625 --> 50:36.083
The victim is male.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.708
He's critical. Left leg laceration.
He's lost a lot of blood.

50:39.791 --> 50:43.541
We urgently need
an advanced ambulance at the scene.

50:43.625 --> 50:45.041
We're trying to stop the bleeding.

50:46.041 --> 50:47.083
Hold my hand.

50:48.708 --> 50:50.166
It's okay.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.708
Chai, let me.

51:22.791 --> 51:24.541
Prepare to swap. One, two, three.

51:24.625 --> 51:27.291
-Swap. Pipo?
-Down here.

51:33.500 --> 51:34.958
Go.

51:40.541 --> 51:41.458
The police are here.

51:42.041 --> 51:43.291
Take the team to check out that car.

51:45.416 --> 51:46.583
Let's go.

51:50.208 --> 51:51.333
Tell them to follow.

51:56.500 --> 51:58.666
He won't make it. We'll take care of it.

52:22.875 --> 52:26.708
<i>Chai, don't give up on your brother yet.</i>

52:45.916 --> 52:47.416
There are people on the scene.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.458
Come with me.

53:25.416 --> 53:26.791
We need to talk.

53:33.875 --> 53:35.166
Wanchai.

53:36.416 --> 53:37.458
Wanchai.

53:42.750 --> 53:45.083
Wanchai!

53:45.833 --> 53:46.750
Ready? Lift.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.500
Wanchai!

53:50.583 --> 53:51.541
Wanchai!

56:01.500 --> 56:06.500
