00:10.227 --> 00:12.403
Previously onOne Dollar...

00:12.447 --> 00:15.798
CHELSEA: I grew up with a liar.
So I'm just...

00:15.841 --> 00:19.628
done, you know, being a mark.

00:19.671 --> 00:22.065
You done creeping around
people's windows for the night?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.545
Decided to creep on me?

00:23.588 --> 00:25.242
What are you doing here?

00:25.286 --> 00:26.983
Maybe it's time I finally met
my granddaughter.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.680
That's not fucking happening.

00:28.724 --> 00:29.986
JULIE: I'm beginning to think
you're more interested

00:30.030 --> 00:31.466
in replacing his wife

00:31.509 --> 00:34.121
than figuring out
if maybe he murdered her.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.775
He didn't murder his wife.
Are you insane?

00:36.819 --> 00:38.038
And then, what,
stabbed six other people

00:38.081 --> 00:39.909
in the process
so nobody would suspect?

00:39.952 --> 00:41.693
BUD: What was I supposed to do,
leave him there?

00:41.737 --> 00:43.608
The cops shut us down for
more than a couple of days.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.088
The mill won't survive that!

00:45.132 --> 00:46.350
There was a cancellation
last minute.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.918
The specs on one of
the crates was off.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.181
Don't they check the specs way
earlier than the last minute?

00:51.225 --> 00:53.879
Like, before it's packed?JAKE: I had a good day.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.229
CASS: What's a good day
for a detective?

00:55.272 --> 00:58.101
Mm! Mm.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.103
The mystery order is back, baby.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.715
GARRETT: I got to, like,
live with that shit,

01:03.759 --> 01:05.108
the rest of my life.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.261
♪

01:51.328 --> 01:53.330
♪

02:23.360 --> 02:25.362
♪

02:58.482 --> 03:00.441
$9.67.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.151
Sh... I'm sorry, I'm short.Yeah, I...

03:15.195 --> 03:19.808
JENNY:
Here. Give me your four.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.244
Are you sure?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.898
: Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

03:22.941 --> 03:26.641
JENNY:
Of course.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.034
Looks like
it's going to a good cause.

03:30.688 --> 03:31.820
Yeah.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.909
Here you go.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.869
Thanks.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.353
And the prescriptions
they set aside.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.965
Thanks.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.793
ETTA: Got a new baby
coming next week,

03:48.837 --> 03:50.273
most likely.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.493
Etta, how are you
gonna manage a baby?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.408
The same way I managed
when you were here.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.236
Big ones help
with the little ones.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.628
How it's always been.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.891
So you tell mea story.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.850
Got a fella?

04:01.893 --> 04:05.027
Just cleaning. But I'm good.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.072
Uh, I start
a new place next week.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.031
Real big house. Five bedrooms.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.729
Some real estate guy.What?

04:11.773 --> 04:13.862
See, that makes me happy,
to see my kids

04:13.905 --> 04:15.690
doing good out in the world.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.692
And your education?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.868
Uh, I have some things
in the works.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.870
Mm-hmm.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.394
I need money for my lunch.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.961
Excuse me?Please.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.311
I need money for my lunch,
please, Miss Etta.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.052
What's wrong with the food
we got here?

04:30.095 --> 04:31.619
I'm out mowing lawns.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.316
I don't have time
to come home between.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.665
JENNY:
Can I give him a few?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.624
ETTA:
Lookie there.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.931
Miss Jenny want to give you
her hard-earned money.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.238
Well, I'm not going to let her.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.413
JEREMY:
Figures.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.936
ETTA:
"Figures"?

04:44.980 --> 04:46.634
You need to be working
on them math figures,

04:46.677 --> 04:48.592
instead of running
that sass mouth.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.421
Get out of here
before I wear you out.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.424
That's nice of you,
Miss Jenny.

04:54.468 --> 04:55.860
But that one there?

04:55.904 --> 04:58.341
He needs to learn
to do with less.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.517
He comes from money?

05:00.561 --> 05:02.998
No, he comes from alcoholics,
just like most of y'all.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.872
So the extra roll Bud canceled
the night of Seven Bloods

05:07.916 --> 05:09.221
is rescheduled for tomorrow.

05:09.265 --> 05:12.050
Hmm.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.009
I can't do that, Jake.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.837
Judge Richards is not
gonna give me a warrant

05:15.880 --> 05:18.056
to search on mill property.
Where does it go after that?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.320
I followed it.
It goes through a train depot,

05:20.363 --> 05:22.147
then straight on to Canada.

05:22.191 --> 05:25.412
Okay, well, we'll have
to find some other way, then.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.631
Oh, for fuck's sake. Tell the
judge a confidential informant--

05:27.675 --> 05:29.764
that's me, by the way...Let me finish.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.722
Why can't you ever let me
finish a goddamn thought

05:31.766 --> 05:33.637
before you jump down my throat

05:33.681 --> 05:35.378
Jesus Christ, I'm-a pass out
if I have to listen

05:35.422 --> 05:37.554
to every step
of your master fucking...Hey. I realize that

05:37.598 --> 05:40.557
you pride yourself on using
a fucking hammer for everything.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.820
But some things
require a scalpel.

05:46.998 --> 05:50.045
What?
Come on. Just like
old times, huh?

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
Man, fuck you.Mm, you know.

05:56.617 --> 05:59.228
Here's what I can do.

05:59.271 --> 06:03.232
I can go to the judge
and tell him a C.I. has told me

06:03.275 --> 06:05.234
that there's a connection
between mill activity

06:05.277 --> 06:06.670
and the night the blood
was found,

06:06.714 --> 06:08.193
and we need to search the mill.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
The shipment goes out at,
what, 10:00 p.m.?

06:10.413 --> 06:12.110
Uh So that means

06:12.154 --> 06:14.330
the shipment will be ready
in the mill by the afternoon,

06:14.374 --> 06:17.420
we show up at 3:00 p.m.
with a warrant, and...

06:17.464 --> 06:19.074
The roll is sitting there.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.946
The warrant covers the mill
and everything in it.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.253
Genius.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.299
Well, I'm still not sure Bud
Carl's involved, but I sure hope

06:27.343 --> 06:29.301
this shuts you the
hell up about it.Hmm. Hmm.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.825
So what's say I get a coffee
in here, or something?

06:30.868 --> 06:33.610
I can't seem to find my mug.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.545
BUD: It wasn't
just back there,

06:55.589 --> 06:57.373
there's one on
the front door, too.GOOT: All right.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.114
So you tell them
I don't need the threats.

06:59.157 --> 07:03.988
And if it's not them, I want
to know who the fuck it is.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.251
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
you were gonna be home.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.079
I'll get in touch with them.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.647
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Thanks.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.127
How you doing?Hmm.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.962
Sorry about that.

07:21.005 --> 07:25.619
I'm gonna be working home
most of the day, so, uh,

07:25.662 --> 07:27.751
no need to do the office.
I'll redd up in there.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.405
Okay.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.015
The laundries
are in a hamper,

07:31.059 --> 07:34.236
the-the soap and that you asked
for is on the counter.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.020
Thanks.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.724
One other thing.

07:51.079 --> 07:54.691
Careful.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.911
What happened?

07:56.954 --> 07:58.521
Going to work, come out here,

07:58.565 --> 08:00.958
there's blood all
over everywhere.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.394
Blood?Oh, no, no, no.

08:02.438 --> 08:05.659
It's... paint.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.965
What

08:08.009 --> 08:10.359
Well, it's a prank, you know?

08:10.402 --> 08:12.143
Environmental activist.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.363
Loons hate me
'cause I own a steel mill.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.147
It's happened before.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.366
Anyhow,

08:17.409 --> 08:19.629
I tried cleaning up
best I could,

08:19.673 --> 08:21.283
but nothing helped. You
think you can go over

08:21.326 --> 08:23.807
to Giant Eagle, get a
carpet cleaning machine?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.461
You know, take a pass?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.332
Course.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.033
Um...

08:32.076 --> 08:34.557
Yinz doing okay, these days?

08:34.601 --> 08:37.560
Yeah. Yeah, I, I signed up

08:37.604 --> 08:39.562
for that data processing class
I told you about.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.999
Ah, that's great.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.525
I hope you'll let me know
if you need anything.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.004
Seriously,
anything you need.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.243
Good morning, Elaine.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.984
Hey, Pete.
Hey.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.987
This is, uh, Toni Douglas,
recently joined the Braden PD.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.162
RICHARDS:
Pete.

09:14.205 --> 09:17.252
Come on in.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.737
RICHARDS: How are
Joan and the baby?

09:23.780 --> 09:26.087
Take a load off,
Officer Douglas.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.133
Thank you, ma'am.TRASK: Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Judge.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.744
RICHARDS:
Of course.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.528
Elaine said you have
something on the mill murders.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.139
TRASK:
Yeah, a confidential informant

09:35.183 --> 09:38.360
linked some mill activity to
the night the blood was found.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.102
RICHARDS:
Well, the mill's over here,

09:41.145 --> 09:42.407
murders are over there.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.409
Uh, what's the link
between the two?

09:44.453 --> 09:46.629
Well, my informant told me
a suspicious shipment

09:46.673 --> 09:49.676
will be in the mill tomorrow
and then it'll be gone.

09:49.719 --> 09:50.894
It's now or never.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.200
RICHARDS:
Okay, Pete, but, I mean,

09:52.243 --> 09:53.244
a blood trail
leading to the mill?

09:53.288 --> 09:54.637
TRASK:
I know,

09:54.681 --> 09:56.421
I know, but I need warrants
to search the mill

09:56.465 --> 09:58.815
and get DNA samples
from the employees.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.644
I expect us to find
the link then.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
:
I won't tell if you won't.

10:03.690 --> 10:04.908
RICHARDS:
Elaine!

10:08.085 --> 10:09.609
Need a warrant, Judge?

10:09.652 --> 10:12.481
Okay, people,
we're going in tomorrow.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.962
3:00 p.m. sharp
with the state CSI team.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.921
They'll do their black light
magic, but it's on us

10:17.965 --> 10:19.923
to ask for DNA swabs.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.143
Now Rook here,
fresh from the academy,

10:22.186 --> 10:24.536
is gonna explain the latest
rules on how to ask.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.887
Say what's on this card,
only what's on this card,

10:26.930 --> 10:30.412
and remember,
no matter what they answer...

10:30.455 --> 10:32.153
you say "thank you."

10:32.196 --> 10:34.285
Any questions?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.723
JAKE:
This is me.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.771
No "ta

10:41.815 --> 10:44.034
Ta-da.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.518
It's cute.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.259
I told you I didn't want
to come back here.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.565
:
I was being serious.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.045
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

10:55.089 --> 10:57.352
I could offer you
coffee, but, uh,

10:57.395 --> 11:00.834
I was thinking maybe we'd go up
the street for an iced coffee?

11:00.877 --> 11:03.706
You don't have
to offer me anything.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.447
Lunch was perfect.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.318
I thought it'd be
weird, going on a date

11:07.362 --> 11:08.929
in the daytime.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.931
But it was nice.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.889
It kind of felt like
we were skipping school.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.370
You know, bakers, we, uh,

11:15.413 --> 11:18.590
we do things just
the same as everyone else,

11:18.634 --> 11:21.071
we just do it
when the sun is up.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.117
Hmm.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.395
I wasn't sure if I was
reading you right.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.353
Oh, you were.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.148
Bedroom?Uh, that's my office.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.455
Uh, we're in the bedroom.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.196
You sleep on the couch?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.372
You making fun of me,
sleeping on the couch

12:01.416 --> 12:04.114
I don't really care
where you sleep.

12:04.158 --> 12:07.161
I just want to know
where you fuck.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.832
I got it.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.319
Hey, Elaine.

12:35.363 --> 12:38.409
Uh, sorry, Bud. I didn't mean
to come by unannounced,

12:38.453 --> 12:40.847
but the police chief came by
Judge Richardson's chamber.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.674
BUD: Why don't we get you
in out of the heat, okay?

12:42.718 --> 12:43.850
ELAINE:
Ah, thank you.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.634
I'm wilting.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.809
Are you, uh, thirsty?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.159
ELAINE:
Sure.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.639
BUD :
Um...

12:51.945 --> 12:53.642
Elaine, this is Jenny Ludlow.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.818
Jenny does some work for me
around the house.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.865
Uh, could you, uh, get Ms.
Carlton a glass of water?

12:58.908 --> 13:01.432
I recognize you from somewhere.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.826
Where do I know you from

13:05.306 --> 13:07.612
I clean a lot of places
around town.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.528
: Well, you
got a good one here.

13:10.572 --> 13:13.009
Bud pretty much singlehandedly
saved my family.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.011
All right, let's not
get into all that.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.534
ELAINE: He never
changes, does he?

13:16.578 --> 13:19.233
Mr. Carl's very humble.

13:19.276 --> 13:23.367
Um, let's talk in the office?

13:23.411 --> 13:25.195
Uh, nice to
meet you, Jenny.

13:25.239 --> 13:28.024
Nice to meet you.

13:28.068 --> 13:31.201
You know, I would
lose my job

13:31.245 --> 13:32.768
if the judge knew
I was here?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.118
Let's talk downstairs, okay?

13:40.036 --> 13:42.517
Uh, white noise machine.
And that

13:42.560 --> 13:44.736
sort of emits, like,
the right kind of light

13:44.780 --> 13:46.608
and sound waves and shit.

13:46.651 --> 13:50.133
Sounds like you doubt
the science.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.483
I got a sleep metronome.

13:52.527 --> 13:53.920
Self-cooling pillow.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.444
Earplugs.
Shit on my phone.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.751
Been to the doctors,
therapists, acupuncturists.

13:59.795 --> 14:00.970
When did it start?

14:01.014 --> 14:03.190
What do you mean, start?

14:03.233 --> 14:05.540
I mean, when was the last time
you slept well?

14:07.020 --> 14:08.717
About a year ago.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.285
What happened then?

14:16.290 --> 14:18.466
Do you have nightmares?

14:18.509 --> 14:20.642
You got to sleep
to have nightmares.

14:20.685 --> 14:25.299
I close my eyes and get, like...

14:25.342 --> 14:28.911
Did something terrible happen
in that bedroom back there?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.566
Man, you really want to see
what's in the bedroom, huh?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.220
All right.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.048
Go ahead.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.494
Is this all one case?Uh-huh.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.497
A missing little girl
named Abby Washington.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.935
You may be a
little... obsessive.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.068
Nah, I just
got drunk last night

14:55.111 --> 14:56.983
and wanted to make it look
like I'm a real detective.

15:09.343 --> 15:12.259
BUD:
It's always good to catch up.ELAINE: Yes.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.739
Let's not make it so long
between visits next time.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.220
You bet.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.526
Thanks, Elaine.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.615
ELAINE:
Buddy.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.780
Hey, it's me.

15:55.824 --> 15:59.567
You know that shipment
to Vancouver we talked about?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.873
Yeah.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.485
Hold it aside.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.618
There's something
I'm fixing to put in it.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.534
Yeah, thanks, Walsh.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.895
You want to talk about it?

17:06.938 --> 17:09.941
Are you stressed 'cause
of the Seven Bloods thing?

17:13.597 --> 17:15.208
I've been thinking
about how you told me

17:15.251 --> 17:18.298
all that stuff about your wife.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.517
About losing your wife.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.694
How much that
must weigh on you.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.522
I've been thinking
about you...

17:26.784 --> 17:30.484
...in this big house
by yourself.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.926
It's... roasting out here.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.233
Had the AC on

17:40.276 --> 17:42.931
full blast all day.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.587
Nothing helps.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.330
I like the heat.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.637
When I was in foster
care, we didn't have AC

17:53.681 --> 17:55.248
in the house.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.424
It'd be two, three of us
to a room,

17:57.467 --> 18:00.992
lying there late at night,
sweating in our little beds.

18:01.036 --> 18:04.474
One girl, little older
than me, she said

18:04.518 --> 18:08.478
we should pretend we were
lying on the beach,

18:08.522 --> 18:11.873
wearing suntan lotion.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.789
Pretty funny, 'cause none of us
ever seen the ocean.

18:17.008 --> 18:20.360
You ever do anything
like that?

18:20.403 --> 18:22.013
Like what?

18:22.057 --> 18:25.800
Imagine you're somewhere else?

18:25.843 --> 18:28.846
I don't.

18:31.022 --> 18:34.983
Not sure what would be here
once I got back, I guess.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.169
I didn't finish the upstairs,

18:47.213 --> 18:51.434
and I decided I'm gonna make
some meals for you.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.220
You don't have to do that.No.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.526
Got to eat something
home-cooked every now and then.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.788
I'll be back tomorrow.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.616
Okay if I leave my supplies out?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.662
Of course.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.754
Get some rest, Mr. Carl.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.515
Shit. You scared
the shit out of me.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.560
I'm sorry.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.439
So, what
are we watching?

19:39.482 --> 19:42.050
Oh, it's nothing. It's stupid.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.879
Yeah, you're-you're allowed

19:44.922 --> 19:46.489
to turn the sound on.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.709
I-I know.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.798
I, uh, I just don't
want to wake her up.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.844
No, she's out usually
until, like, 5:00.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.151
She wakes you up at 5:00?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.848
Sometimes.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.546
I don't know
how you do it.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.113
I mean, I'm tired
after a couple hours with her.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.377
You do it 24-7
by yourself.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.466
Well, it's not exactly 24-7.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.991
Uh... I work a lot.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.862
She, uh, she sleeps a lot.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.170
Um, you know,
I got the day care lady.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.172
I got...

20:17.216 --> 20:19.261
I got you.

20:21.394 --> 20:25.049
Um... can I ask you a question?

20:25.093 --> 20:27.051
Yeah, sure.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.140
Where's her mom?

20:31.142 --> 20:32.883
Oh, shit. I'm-I'm sorry.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.058
I really shouldn't
have asked that.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.277
That's, like, personal
and, you know.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.888
No, no, that's fine. Uh...

20:37.932 --> 20:40.717
I'm actually surprised this is,
like, the first time you're...

20:40.761 --> 20:42.284
you're asking me about it.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.286
Uh, I...

20:44.330 --> 20:45.809
Yeah, I, um, I had, like,

20:45.853 --> 20:46.984
a summer fling.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.290
Got a girl pregnant.

20:48.334 --> 20:51.162
Uh, she didn't tell me
she was pregnant.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.556
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't
really know about Carrie

20:53.600 --> 20:55.776
until she was, like, one.Shit.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.518
Mm-hmm. Once Carrie
started to walk,

20:58.561 --> 21:00.433
the girl decided
she didn't really want

21:00.476 --> 21:02.173
to be a mom anymore, so...

21:02.217 --> 21:05.394
So, what, she just, like,
gave you a call?

21:05.438 --> 21:07.222
She was like,
"Hey, so, um,

21:07.266 --> 21:08.354
"we have a kid.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.357
"Uh, I don't really want
to be the mom.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.967
"Uh, do you want her?

21:13.010 --> 21:16.318
Or else I'll just...
I'll give her up for adoption."

21:16.362 --> 21:17.928
And that was it?

21:17.972 --> 21:21.497
So she's just gone,
out of her life?

21:21.541 --> 21:23.151
Doesn't want anything
to do with her own kid?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.979
Yeah, she's
pretty fucked up.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.851
:
Yeah, sounds like it.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.984
And what's this all
gonna be like

21:30.027 --> 21:31.159
for Carrie
in a couple years?

21:31.202 --> 21:33.596
I don't know.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.948
You know, I,
you know, I-I really...

21:37.992 --> 21:40.168
I don't, um...

21:40.211 --> 21:41.691
I don't even know, like,

21:41.735 --> 21:43.563
what I'm gonna, like,
tell her, you know?

21:43.606 --> 21:46.566
Uh, so if-if it's
cool with you,

21:46.609 --> 21:49.003
we could just...

21:49.046 --> 21:52.354
you know, keep this
between me and you?

21:55.401 --> 21:58.447
Yeah, of course.Thanks.

22:01.145 --> 22:03.278
You know, she's gonna
wake you up at 5:00.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.019
I... should get going.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.804
Yeah.Good night.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.806
Good night.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.970
What's going on, Pete?

22:44.014 --> 22:46.930
I'm sorry about this.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.846
Y-You couldn't
give me a heads

22:49.890 --> 22:52.675
I said I'd cooperate.
Now you come in here

22:52.719 --> 22:54.155
with sirens blaring?

22:54.198 --> 22:57.550
I need you
to-to bank your furnace.

22:57.593 --> 23:00.596
It's-it's 3,000
degrees in there.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.206
What do you... what
do you expect to find?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.948
It's nothing personal,
but you said that you left

23:04.992 --> 23:06.950
at 10:00 p.m. that night, right?

23:06.994 --> 23:09.605
So how do you know what your men

23:09.649 --> 23:11.912
were up to after you left?

23:11.955 --> 23:13.914
Okay.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.481
I'm sorry.You got a job to do.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.526
Yep.

23:18.527 --> 23:22.270
You know, cops set for OT.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.837
My guys lose days of pay.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.534
That's on you, Pete.

23:25.578 --> 23:28.581
Walsh, give 'em
whatever they want.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.881
Uh, let's get all of yinz
lined up single file

24:07.924 --> 24:09.970
behind this guy over here.
Come here, sir.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.624
Let's get you over here.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.670
Come on, let's get lined
up single file behind him.

24:14.714 --> 24:17.020
Be back in a second.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.761
What do they
even think we did,

24:18.805 --> 24:20.415
killed seven people
from out of town?

24:20.459 --> 24:23.679
Ravens fans. They think
we killed seven Ravens fans.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.159
Now, that's a dumbass theory.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.508
It's summertime.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.075
In summertime,
we kill Cardinals fans.

24:30.599 --> 24:33.341
CHEWY: Okay, uh, we're
gonna get started now.

24:33.384 --> 24:34.473
TERRI:
Started with what?

24:34.516 --> 24:35.778
We'll explain, ma'am.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.998
"Ma'am." You hear that?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.261
You could use a little more
of that, Short Stack.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.524
Did she just fucking
call me Short Stack?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.570
Come in one at a time, please.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.006
All right, go with her, sir.

24:46.049 --> 24:49.618
Sir, you can come with me.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.099
Do you voluntarily consent
to provide a DNA sample

24:52.142 --> 24:54.057
for investigative purposes?
It is your right

24:54.101 --> 24:55.494
to say no, and if
you do say no,

24:55.537 --> 24:59.019
it won't be considered
suspicious or uncooperative.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.325
So I

25:01.369 --> 25:03.414
Yes, sir.

25:04.459 --> 25:05.721
Okay, yeah.

25:05.765 --> 25:08.855
Um, all right, let's do it.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.421
Um, you have to sign this first.

25:10.465 --> 25:13.076
Says you gave your consent
voluntarily.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.651
Thank you. Step forward.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.961
MAN:
Okay, sir...

25:29.484 --> 25:31.704
CHEWY:
Um, do you voluntarily consent

25:31.747 --> 25:35.142
to provide a DNA sample
for investigative purposes?

25:35.185 --> 25:37.623
It's your right to say no,
and if you do say no,

25:37.666 --> 25:40.234
it won't be considered
suspicious or uncooperative.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.541
Such bullshit.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.543
I mean, obviously,
if I say no,

25:44.586 --> 25:46.240
you're gonna say
that I'm guilty, right?

25:46.283 --> 25:48.895
I never said that, right?

25:48.938 --> 25:50.592
Like, I didn't make a face
at her or nothing, right?

25:50.636 --> 25:53.900
I just read the card.Jesus, calm down, big guy.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.902
I'm just fucking with you.

25:55.945 --> 25:59.079
So it's a yes, then?No.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.647
I'm saying no. It's my spit.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.779
Maybe I got plans for it later.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.303
Oh, he's fun.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.523
Good game, good game,
good game, good game, good game.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.524
Psych!Next.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.569
Good game, good game.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.453
Garrett!

26:44.515 --> 26:47.910
You know, they-they're down
there taking my fucking DNA.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.695
I know.

26:49.738 --> 26:52.654
I got a plan.
I'm working on it.

26:55.309 --> 26:58.007
You got every right
to be mad at me.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.792
I'm so sorry...

26:59.835 --> 27:01.924
for coming over
the other day unannounced.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.797
I've been wanting to say
those things for a long time.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.015
I chose the wrong moment.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.626
What are-- what are you
fucking doing?

27:10.716 --> 27:13.066
If this plan works,

27:13.109 --> 27:15.155
it's almost over.:
Yeah.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.636
Yeah, you-you keep...
you keep saying that.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.595
You think I want it to be
this complicated?

27:24.904 --> 27:27.297
Look, I need your help

27:27.341 --> 27:29.299
just once more.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.737
A little OT.The furnace
is banked.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.477
What the fuck
you want me to do?

27:33.521 --> 27:35.175
I need you to operate
a forklift tonight,

27:35.218 --> 27:38.004
put some rolls on
a boxcar at 11:00.

and searched the mill again?

I don't know.

41:47.069 --> 41:49.071
Maybe.

41:50.595 --> 41:54.642
You know, my grandpa...

41:54.686 --> 41:57.993
started Carl Steel
with a contract

41:58.037 --> 42:02.432
to make helmets
for the army.

42:02.476 --> 42:05.131
And he got us through
the D-Depression somehow,

42:05.174 --> 42:07.220
and then boom...

42:07.263 --> 42:11.050
World War II.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.356
And then he gave it
to my pop...

42:13.400 --> 42:17.056
and he made steel for...

42:17.099 --> 42:20.276
cars and skyscrapers,

42:20.320 --> 42:23.323
this town in the process.

42:23.366 --> 42:26.239
And then...

42:26.282 --> 42:29.590
the '80s came.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.724
He gave it to me.

42:32.767 --> 42:35.378
I feel like all I've
ever been able to do

42:35.422 --> 42:38.599
is foul off pitches, you know?

42:38.643 --> 42:41.384
