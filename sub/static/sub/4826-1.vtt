<i>This is O'Hare, California.</i>

01:08.835 --> 01:12.673
<i>Back then, it was nothing more
than a sleepy fishing village</i>

01:12.773 --> 01:14.640
<i>with a hill at the end of Main Street.</i>

01:18.011 --> 01:20.605
<i>Like you see in postcards.</i>

01:22.615 --> 01:25.386
<i>My story takes place on the home front,</i>

01:25.786 --> 01:28.253
<i>in the midst of World War II.</i>

01:30.657 --> 01:32.726
That's me...

01:33.026 --> 01:34.510
the little fella.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.430
Closer?

01:39.533 --> 01:42.698
Stop causing trouble, you midget.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.705
<i>Nobody in that town liked me much.</i>

01:51.411 --> 01:53.745
One, two, three.

01:55.298 --> 01:58.068
<i>I was eight years old.</i>

01:58.168 --> 02:01.753
<i>But the story really starts
the day I met my dad.</i>

02:03.089 --> 02:05.226
<i>My only friend.</i>

02:06.326 --> 02:08.195
<i>My partner.</i>

02:08.544 --> 02:09.812
He's a boy.

02:10.981 --> 02:13.784
- He's so...
- What? Little?

02:13.884 --> 02:16.253
Well, he'll grow.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.503
Right?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.342
I got you covered, okay?

02:33.225 --> 02:35.469
'Cause we're partners.

02:39.876 --> 02:42.613
<i>I wanted to be just like him.</i>

02:43.113 --> 02:44.646
<i>And do everything he did.</i>

02:48.451 --> 02:52.954
<i>And everything we did
became a great adventure.</i>

02:55.758 --> 02:59.796
Very proud of you, partner.
You handled the pain like a true hero.

02:59.896 --> 03:02.833
Actually, you remind me
of another hero...

03:03.133 --> 03:05.669
"Ben Eagle, The Magician."

03:05.969 --> 03:09.606
And Ben Eagle said to his sidekick,
"Do you believe you can do this?"

03:09.706 --> 03:14.259
<i>"Do you believe you can do this?"
That became our motto.</i>

03:21.218 --> 03:23.921
- Do you believe we can do this?
- Yes, I believe we can do this.

03:24.321 --> 03:26.788
Let's go, partner.

03:31.293 --> 03:34.798
- The mast is broken.
- Partner, do you believe you can do this?

03:34.898 --> 03:36.834
Yes, I believe I can do this.

03:37.734 --> 03:41.588
- <i>This is the police.</i>
- Partner, do you believe we can do this?

03:41.688 --> 03:43.738
Yes, partner.

03:44.138 --> 03:46.939
Pepper. Pepper Flynt Busbee,

03:47.039 --> 03:49.914
- I've been yelling for 20 minutes.
- <i>That's my mom.</i>

03:50.014 --> 03:52.182
Come on, we're in the middle
of a great story.

03:52.282 --> 03:54.918
<i>Always there to snap us back to reality.</i>

03:55.748 --> 03:57.786
It's time to go to bed.

03:59.555 --> 04:00.724
Come on.

04:02.202 --> 04:04.561
<i>And that's my brother, London.</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:08.599
<i>Finally old enough
to sign up for the fight.</i>

04:08.699 --> 04:12.100
- Bye, Mom.
- <i>All was good in the old Busbee home.</i>

04:15.752 --> 04:18.106
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

04:28.718 --> 04:31.224
The new "Ben Eagle"!

04:33.689 --> 04:37.294
- You gotta bring your quarter for a look-see.
- What are you having, your usual today?

04:37.394 --> 04:39.897
- Yeah, give me the usual.
- Me too.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.600
<i>The war was still raging.</i>

04:43.700 --> 04:46.169
<i>The enemy has infiltrated the USA.</i>

04:46.269 --> 04:49.184
<i>Stupid American,
you know not what Tokyo do.</i>

04:49.284 --> 04:52.639
<i>Not on my watch, little fella.</i>

04:56.245 --> 05:00.084
<i>Everyone was pitching in,
doing their part.</i>

05:01.184 --> 05:05.689
<i>Uncle Sam had all the teens
lining up, ready to fight.</i>

05:05.789 --> 05:07.823
Busbee, London.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.162
Sorry, son. 4F.

05:12.961 --> 05:15.532
Hoffman, William.

05:15.632 --> 05:18.035
Sergeant, sir?

05:18.135 --> 05:22.139
With all due respect, what do flat feet
have to do with killing Japs?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.576
That's just the way it is, kid.

05:25.476 --> 05:26.739
Thanks.

05:26.839 --> 05:29.388
Welcome to the US Army.

05:30.513 --> 05:33.481
Landry, Gene.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.455
How's the weather down there, "Midget"?

05:37.555 --> 05:39.297
Two vanillas.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.160
Hey, the world looks bigger
from down here.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.496
He sure is small.

05:45.896 --> 05:48.829
Hey, where's your cane, "Tiny Tim"?

05:56.472 --> 06:00.108
- You think you're gonna buy 'em this time?
- No, not today.

06:15.691 --> 06:17.692
Piece of junk!

06:21.263 --> 06:23.467
4F. Stupid war.

06:24.067 --> 06:27.004
I can't let you do this, Dad.
This is my fight.

06:27.104 --> 06:30.856
- But you always knew one of us had to go.
- It was supposed to be me.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.097
Come on, Lon.
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

06:46.922 --> 06:50.391
London's not going to war, right?

07:08.612 --> 07:12.416
Does that mean that...
you're going instead?

07:13.416 --> 07:15.157
Yes.

07:16.532 --> 07:18.753
He'll be back before you know it.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.628
- Why can't we stay together?
- Partner, I have to go.

07:25.228 --> 07:27.162
I don't want you to go.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.309
Time's up, privates.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.704
You got nothing to blame yourself about.

08:07.804 --> 08:10.005
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- All right.

09:40.495 --> 09:42.265
I'm not a midget, right?

09:42.765 --> 09:45.468
We shouldn't use that word.

09:45.568 --> 09:48.972
"Midget" is a mean word
for people with dwarfism.

09:49.072 --> 09:51.772
I'm afraid your son had something
to do with the nickname.

09:52.142 --> 09:54.011
- Mom!
- That's okay, Pepper.

09:54.111 --> 09:57.946
I will make sure Freddy
makes things right.

10:06.588 --> 10:08.559
Any news from James?

10:08.659 --> 10:11.995
He should be here on the 15th.
He said his tour would end by summer.

10:12.595 --> 10:15.529
That's what he said in his last letter.

10:20.135 --> 10:24.032
- Do I have dwarfism or what?
- You know what? Let's...

10:24.132 --> 10:27.844
just keep an eye on you. It's really
too soon to make any type of diagnosis.

10:27.944 --> 10:32.883
I will, however, suggest
we see each other regularly.

10:32.983 --> 10:37.117
But for now, Pepper,
let's just say you're a...

10:38.820 --> 10:40.188
little boy.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.367
Teacup!

10:50.617 --> 10:52.385
Come on, get up.

10:53.835 --> 10:56.774
Mr. Jones yelled at me yesterday.

10:57.574 --> 11:01.745
He really blew a fuse about his car.
He said you were a...

11:02.245 --> 11:05.612
- You want to know what he called you?
- No, I don't.

11:08.850 --> 11:10.718
Let's hear this baby hum.

11:28.803 --> 11:30.272
Why is this thing not working?

11:30.372 --> 11:33.243
The old one works fine.
Your dad was happy with it.

11:33.343 --> 11:35.245
What do you know?

11:36.144 --> 11:38.349
He's gonna love this.

11:38.449 --> 11:41.508
Now mind your own and get
the lousy Packard ready.

11:42.684 --> 11:44.905
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.972
- Don't need your pestering, either.
- And what about my money?

11:48.072 --> 11:50.271
- I don't have any.
- But mom told you.

11:50.371 --> 11:54.813
"But mom told you." This ain't time
to be spending money like that.

12:08.243 --> 12:10.278
What a waste.

12:20.390 --> 12:22.893
Dad's been eyeing these boots
for a long time, hasn't he?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.999
Yes, he has.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.548
Thank you.

12:33.269 --> 12:37.840
Hi, Jenny. Can I have two tickets
for the "Ben Eagle Show"?

12:37.940 --> 12:40.076
Does this mean your father's
coming back?

12:40.176 --> 12:43.611
Yeah, he should be here soon.
Bye, Jenny. Thank you.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.927
Good morning, Mrs. Busbee.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.201
On March 11th, your husband,

13:05.301 --> 13:09.272
James L. Busbee
was part of a tactical operation.

13:09.372 --> 13:14.275
His platoon was sent to secure Malabang,
a village in the Philippines.

13:28.790 --> 13:30.725
I can't wait to see him. He's the best.

13:32.829 --> 13:36.464
Hey, look. It's the midget
who ratted on me.

13:40.537 --> 13:43.704
- Come on, let's get him!
- Get him!

13:46.876 --> 13:48.063
Fight!

14:02.891 --> 14:07.104
Midget! Midget! Midget!
Midget! Midget! Midget...

14:09.732 --> 14:11.207
Stop!

14:12.031 --> 14:16.037
We can't call him "midget."
It could traumatize him.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.743
Gimme that.

14:33.655 --> 14:37.695
In the name of the freakiest thing
alive, I baptize you,

14:37.795 --> 14:39.130
"Little Boy."

14:43.403 --> 14:45.565
Okay. Okay.

14:46.830 --> 14:49.172
Is my husband dead or alive?

14:49.272 --> 14:52.909
We don't know, ma'am.
His body wasn't located at the scene.

14:53.009 --> 14:56.276
We believe he's been taken
as a prisoner of war.

15:01.885 --> 15:04.274
Good luck getting out.

15:36.276 --> 15:37.618
What's wrong?

16:38.113 --> 16:40.350
He's barely eaten all week.

16:41.582 --> 16:43.784
Just take him, would you?

16:46.988 --> 16:50.660
He got the extra ticket for your dad.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.574
Fine.

16:57.165 --> 17:01.171
<i>Elegant in his top hat
and floating cane,</i>

17:01.853 --> 17:03.596
<i>Ben Eagle, the magician...</i>

17:05.525 --> 17:07.529
<i>is in reality...</i>

17:09.578 --> 17:12.549
<i>a super crime fighter!</i>

17:13.848 --> 17:15.518
<i>In today's episode,</i>

17:15.617 --> 17:20.028
<i>is Tyra finally safe
from the clutches of Sir Pent?</i>

17:33.134 --> 17:35.371
Hey! Going for a drink.

17:35.904 --> 17:38.908
But the live show is next.

17:39.508 --> 17:44.714
<i>This is what happens
to Ben Eagle's precious interest.</i>

17:44.914 --> 17:46.266
<i>You'll never get away with it.</i>

17:46.366 --> 17:49.052
<i>What are we gonna do?
There are too many.</i>

17:49.152 --> 17:51.641
<i>Interpretation, Kid Falcon.</i>

17:51.741 --> 17:53.987
<i>I hope this works.</i>

18:03.932 --> 18:05.365
<i>Ben Eagle!</i>

18:07.052 --> 18:09.553
<i>Ben Eagle!</i>

18:15.410 --> 18:19.146
And now, the moment of truth.

18:21.717 --> 18:23.184
I am searching.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.155
Searching for the one

18:27.275 --> 18:31.918
who the High Lama of Tibet told me
would be in this very room.

18:33.795 --> 18:36.246
- The chosen one.
- Me!

18:38.767 --> 18:40.552
You.

18:44.939 --> 18:47.075
Look who's here.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.639
London.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.047
My boy.

18:52.148 --> 18:55.018
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, London. The usual?

18:55.818 --> 18:59.089
What you are about to see
is not an illusion.

18:59.189 --> 19:03.259
You will bear witness
to a profound experience.

19:03.359 --> 19:06.763
The movement of an inanimate object

19:07.163 --> 19:09.252
through inner power.

19:09.352 --> 19:11.019
But I'm not gonna perform it.

19:11.119 --> 19:13.867
My new colleague will.

19:41.196 --> 19:43.533
Now you have the power.

19:44.133 --> 19:47.868
It's up to you
to achieve the impossible.

19:51.739 --> 19:54.749
- But they're gonna make fun of me.
- Not if you move the bottle, they won't.

19:55.099 --> 19:57.513
You just do as I say.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.686
Raise your hands and point them
at the bottle. There.

20:03.886 --> 20:06.556
Get off the stage, runt!

20:06.656 --> 20:09.158
Ignore the world. Ignore the world.

20:09.258 --> 20:12.462
- Focus.
- Stand up, little boy.

20:12.562 --> 20:17.064
- He is standing.
- Get him a step stool.

20:26.107 --> 20:28.711
Do you believe you can do this?

20:29.211 --> 20:32.413
<i>Partner, do you believe you can do this?</i>

20:42.857 --> 20:45.462
Do you believe you can move it,
yes or no?

20:47.929 --> 20:50.867
Yes, I believe I can move the bottle.

20:50.967 --> 20:54.537
- I don't believe you.
- Yes, I believe I can move it!

20:54.637 --> 20:58.638
- Louder.
- Yes! I can move the bottle!

21:40.348 --> 21:44.320
That's the kind of faith that Moses had
when he parted the Red Sea...

21:44.420 --> 21:47.516
the kind of faith that little David
had when he defeated Goliath

21:47.616 --> 21:49.659
with a little stone.

21:49.759 --> 21:53.595
That's what we need, my friends,
in these difficult times.

21:53.695 --> 21:57.800
So like Father Oliver used to ask,
"What can we do?

21:57.900 --> 22:00.403
What can we do for our relatives at war?

22:01.803 --> 22:04.838
What can we do if we are here

22:04.938 --> 22:07.203
and they are there?

22:07.719 --> 22:08.990
And the answer is...

22:11.056 --> 22:15.050
if we have faith the size
of a mustard seed,

22:15.150 --> 22:16.452
we can move a mountain.

22:17.248 --> 22:21.157
If we can move a mountain,
then nothing will be impossible for us.

22:21.657 --> 22:24.471
Not even ending this war...

22:25.394 --> 22:28.127
and having our loved ones back.

22:32.967 --> 22:36.572
<i>I already knew someone
who could move a mountain.</i>

22:36.672 --> 22:41.709
<i>I wondered if the source of his powers
was the mustard seed.</i>

22:59.594 --> 23:03.162
<i>This was a source of unlimited powers?</i>

23:04.799 --> 23:09.035
<i>So if this was true,
this was all I needed to...</i>

23:14.575 --> 23:17.012
<i>And there he was...</i>

23:17.112 --> 23:18.984
<i>the enemy.</i>

23:20.015 --> 23:22.552
- London!
- What?

23:23.252 --> 23:26.678
There's a Jap at Gilliam's.

23:28.039 --> 23:31.944
<i>I couldn't understand how one of them
was free in O'Hare.</i>

23:32.094 --> 23:34.562
<i>After Pearl Harbor,
they put them all in camps.</i>

23:38.300 --> 23:41.070
<i>After years of internment,
the Army, in its wisdom,</i>

23:41.170 --> 23:43.806
<i>has decided to release
those of Japanese ancestry</i>

23:43.906 --> 23:46.829
<i>who have proven loyal to the US.</i>

23:48.210 --> 23:52.314
<i>They seem harmless, don't they?
But can we trust them?</i>

23:52.414 --> 23:57.784
<i>Well, I for one, remember Pearl Harbor,
so I say, "Remain vigilant."</i>

24:09.097 --> 24:11.536
Store doesn't serve Japs.

24:14.302 --> 24:16.970
Everything okay here?

24:22.676 --> 24:25.606
You forgot the onions, Hashimoto.
Put these on my tab.

24:25.706 --> 24:28.718
- Father, with all due respect...
- Now, Gilliam.

24:29.818 --> 24:32.955
- These too.
- Of course, Father.

24:33.055 --> 24:36.158
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing
again and again and again

24:36.258 --> 24:40.660
about Pearl Harbor and about how my son
"gave his life for his country."

24:41.863 --> 24:44.066
Because he didn't.

24:44.766 --> 24:47.567
Those Japs took his life.

24:49.038 --> 24:52.039
And they did it in the most
cowardly way you can imagine.

24:56.211 --> 24:59.191
We need to do something about that Jap.

25:01.516 --> 25:05.885
If I could, I would smash
every Jap with my bare hands.

25:35.783 --> 25:38.292
That's the rat's dump.

25:39.553 --> 25:42.416
You want to smash him
with your bare hands?

25:44.725 --> 25:46.574
Here you go.

25:47.074 --> 25:48.979
Have at him.

25:50.565 --> 25:52.662
Go on.

26:15.590 --> 26:17.682
There he is!

26:25.233 --> 26:28.067
Take that, dirty Jap!

26:32.273 --> 26:35.442
Maybe this'll let him know
that "slants" ain't welcome...

26:38.412 --> 26:43.250
<i>I finally understood why
they don't let flat feet into the Army.</i>

27:05.840 --> 27:10.329
Five groups of 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers."

27:10.429 --> 27:12.431
In Latin.

27:19.487 --> 27:22.797
Amen. Now you.

27:23.691 --> 27:25.653
In Latin?

27:27.295 --> 27:30.163
Thank God nothing happened to Hashimoto.

27:31.836 --> 27:34.771
- I've finished.
- Very good.

27:35.964 --> 27:36.906
Something else?

27:38.011 --> 27:40.842
The seed itself doesn't do anything.
What I said is...

27:41.042 --> 27:43.941
"If you have faith,
the invisible power"...

27:44.041 --> 27:47.714
- Like Ben Eagle's powers?
- "Ben Eagle"?

27:50.618 --> 27:54.086
Well, no, that's just fantasy.

28:01.129 --> 28:03.299
How can you say that?

28:03.399 --> 28:06.888
I met Ben Eagle and he showed me
how to move a bottle.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.339
He can also move a mountain,
just like you said.

28:10.439 --> 28:15.546
No, no, no. That's not the same thing.
That's not faith. Let's see.

28:15.646 --> 28:20.442
- If you have faith, "fides" in Latin...
- Crispin...

28:21.242 --> 28:23.305
I'll take it from here.

28:24.585 --> 28:25.891
I understand.

28:30.157 --> 28:31.344
Take a seat.

28:37.198 --> 28:41.701
Why don't you show me
how you moved the bottle?

28:42.270 --> 28:45.611
- You want to see?
- Yes, I do.

29:05.493 --> 29:08.331
I guess that was stupid of me.

29:15.236 --> 29:17.523
Why don't you try again?

29:51.471 --> 29:53.272
Again.

30:11.692 --> 30:13.462
There, it moved.

30:15.232 --> 30:19.902
- No, you moved it.
- Yes, because you moved me to move it.

30:20.002 --> 30:24.607
See, I moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much.

30:24.707 --> 30:29.008
And that, you could say,
is how faith works.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.867
At least some of the time.

30:32.547 --> 30:35.915
And this is as much as I need
to move a mountain?

30:39.186 --> 30:40.989
In theory, yes.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.293
But... it's up to Him.

30:44.693 --> 30:48.195
- He's the mover.
- How could I get bigger faith?

31:01.342 --> 31:04.713
The list, the ancient list.

31:04.813 --> 31:07.483
For centuries, people believed
that if you do this list,

31:07.583 --> 31:10.719
it'll make your faith... powerful.

31:10.819 --> 31:13.155
This is what you have to do.

31:13.255 --> 31:15.289
"Feed the hungry,

31:16.591 --> 31:18.727
shelter the homeless,

31:19.782 --> 31:21.830
visit those in prison,

31:22.930 --> 31:25.901
- clothe the naked."
- Naked?

31:26.001 --> 31:28.804
How is that supposed to...

31:28.904 --> 31:31.107
"Visit the sick,

31:32.127 --> 31:33.540
bury the dead."

31:37.778 --> 31:39.615
Oh, just one more thing.

31:39.715 --> 31:42.217
In order to make this list work for you,

31:42.317 --> 31:48.088
I'm gonna add one essential item.

31:53.093 --> 31:56.565
"Befriend Hashimoto"?! Are you crazy?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.600
It's your choice, Pepper.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.586
What does that Jap
have to do with anything?

32:02.137 --> 32:03.970
Everything.

32:05.439 --> 32:08.310
Your faith won't work

32:08.410 --> 32:11.458
if you have even the slightest bit
of hatred in you.

32:17.318 --> 32:22.821
Fine. I'll do it if that's what
it takes to bring my dad back.

32:23.758 --> 32:26.665
- Come again?
- Bring my dad back.

32:28.229 --> 32:32.167
Yes, but only if it's God's will.

32:32.267 --> 32:35.435
Why wouldn't God
want to bring my dad back?

32:40.007 --> 32:41.543
I don't know.

32:41.643 --> 32:46.478
But if I get enough faith,
nothing's impossible, right?

32:50.317 --> 32:52.052
Yeah.

33:49.077 --> 33:52.884
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry about the other day.

34:01.555 --> 34:02.891
So, were you nice to him?

34:02.991 --> 34:06.859
Yeah. How can anyone
be friends with a Jap?

34:08.295 --> 34:11.664
Take him a gift, as a peace offering.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.675
Hey, Jap.

34:26.179 --> 34:28.262
Want a soda?

35:15.831 --> 35:18.800
And all he did was
throw it in the trash.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.104
Oh, I think you'll be okay.

35:24.973 --> 35:27.843
- Hang out with him.
- Hang out?

35:27.943 --> 35:31.010
Yep. Just get to know him.

35:35.983 --> 35:39.489
Ollie, why are you getting me
involved in this?

35:39.589 --> 35:42.875
I just don't see how this helps anyone.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.402
Yes, yes, he did,

35:47.502 --> 35:51.442
but I don't even drink soda.

35:51.867 --> 35:56.101
Jeez. Just tell the kid to stop.

35:56.337 --> 35:58.125
Oh, no, he's back again.

36:02.176 --> 36:03.679
Hey!

36:04.379 --> 36:06.401
What are you doing
monkeying around my house?

36:06.701 --> 36:08.383
I want to hang out.

36:08.783 --> 36:10.952
Go hang out somewhere else.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.039
I meant with you.

36:28.569 --> 36:31.498
Okay. Let's "hang out."

36:37.344 --> 36:40.712
Come on, get in, "Little Boy."

36:42.316 --> 36:45.088
Bad nicknames travel fast in this town.

36:45.188 --> 36:49.248
My family knows where I am.
Especially London.

37:03.212 --> 37:05.305
Okay, let's hang out.

37:14.582 --> 37:17.035
Go ahead, I'll meet you inside.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.151
No, no.

37:20.109 --> 37:21.988
Okay.

37:26.727 --> 37:28.737
What's he doing here?

37:33.034 --> 37:34.832
Come.

37:48.115 --> 37:49.384
What can I get you?

37:49.484 --> 37:53.852
- I'll have a chocolate sundae with...
- Hey, I ain't talking to you, Nip.

37:59.593 --> 38:01.835
What do you want, Little Boy?

38:02.596 --> 38:04.364
Two scoops of vanilla.

38:13.307 --> 38:16.309
I haven't had ice cream in years.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.282
Why are you eating my ice cream?

38:21.382 --> 38:23.819
You can get ice cream anytime.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.607
Next time, try chocolate.

38:30.991 --> 38:33.995
Now are we finished hanging out?

38:34.095 --> 38:36.465
Then can I scratch you from my list?

38:37.578 --> 38:41.801
- What list?
- Father Oliver's "ancient list."

38:44.237 --> 38:46.172
No, Ollie.

38:47.741 --> 38:51.891
You told the boy that if he waves
a magic wand, he can bring his father back.

38:51.991 --> 38:54.060
- You don't believe that, do you?
- Maybe.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.349
Maybe not.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.184
If it's God's will, yes.

39:03.284 --> 39:07.162
He can do anything. He could turn you
into a rabbit if He wanted to.

39:07.262 --> 39:10.430
Have faith, Hashimoto.
You should try it.

39:12.409 --> 39:14.736
Not again.

39:14.836 --> 39:17.339
I do have faith.

39:17.439 --> 39:21.541
Faith in oneself.
Not in your imaginary friend in the sky.

39:25.045 --> 39:29.849
Let's hope this little game of yours
doesn't mess with the boy's mind.

39:32.586 --> 39:36.291
Two weeks? But what about the list?

39:36.391 --> 39:40.161
- I already finished with the Jap.
- Really?

39:40.261 --> 39:42.295
We're friends now.

39:43.964 --> 39:49.085
You continue with Mr. Hashimoto till
I can't see the hate in your eyes anymore.

39:51.071 --> 39:55.177
Go and visit a prisoner.
You already know one.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.617
I'll help you with the list
when I get back.

40:02.717 --> 40:04.666
I promise.

40:22.870 --> 40:27.208
Befriend that rat
in order to get dad back?

40:27.308 --> 40:30.211
By doing this stupid list?

40:30.311 --> 40:34.647
By befriending him,
all you're doing is betraying Dad.

40:47.387 --> 40:48.563
Hey!

40:48.663 --> 40:50.697
Where do you think
you're going, Little Boy?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.485
Come on.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.974
Jap lover!

41:24.564 --> 41:26.985
You can drop me off here.

42:49.916 --> 42:53.194
I don't have anyone
to help me with my list.

43:05.357 --> 43:07.067
Okay.

43:07.167 --> 43:11.965
First things first...
my name is not "Jap."

43:16.243 --> 43:17.859
It's Hashimoto.

43:29.323 --> 43:32.282
All right, come in.

43:56.416 --> 44:00.543
Okay, come. Show me what you got.

44:06.639 --> 44:08.897
Where do we start?

44:09.597 --> 44:12.166
"Visit those in prison."

44:12.686 --> 44:15.182
Why is this crossed out?

44:16.370 --> 44:18.239
My brother.

44:18.539 --> 44:21.170
At least that schmuck
was good for something.

44:21.270 --> 44:23.311
"Visit the sick."

44:23.711 --> 44:25.914
I can help you with that one.

44:26.719 --> 44:30.582
Okay, just wait for me over here.

44:33.553 --> 44:35.857
I'm here for my monthly check-up.

44:36.423 --> 44:38.635
Who's your friend?

44:42.462 --> 44:44.552
He's not my friend.

44:44.652 --> 44:46.528
Thank you.

44:48.769 --> 44:51.172
Pepper. Come on.

44:52.125 --> 44:54.440
He's "not his friend."

45:16.996 --> 45:18.728
Hi.

45:22.486 --> 45:24.093
I was just visiting.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.369
You can keep it.

45:44.591 --> 45:46.642
Thanks, kid.

45:50.397 --> 45:52.956
"Shelter the homeless."

45:53.601 --> 45:56.803
Is that one-eared oaf
still working at the shop?

45:56.903 --> 45:58.873
Teacup?

45:59.729 --> 46:01.908
<i>Yeah, he sleeps there.</i>

46:03.510 --> 46:06.422
Not quite a home, right?

46:07.022 --> 46:10.449
What about London's vacant bed?

46:16.089 --> 46:18.630
Hey, they fit.

46:18.730 --> 46:21.095
I've never worn one of these before.

46:22.210 --> 46:24.144
It feels...

46:24.244 --> 46:26.062
nice.

46:26.162 --> 46:29.000
Then I guess you can keep 'em, Teacup.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.676
The next one...

46:44.085 --> 46:46.799
"Clothe the naked."

46:50.438 --> 46:51.626
"Spider ladies."

46:52.246 --> 46:55.061
They "knit and bite" all day.

47:01.601 --> 47:03.704
Shouldn't you be somewhere,

47:03.804 --> 47:08.143
playing with sticks or something,
with your friends?

47:09.214 --> 47:11.820
He has no friends.

47:21.154 --> 47:23.639
You put these two...

47:34.201 --> 47:37.703
- I think the baby's gonna like it.
- Thank you.

47:40.707 --> 47:42.911
<i>With Hashimoto's help,</i>

47:43.511 --> 47:46.382
<i>I'd finished the list in no time.</i>

47:47.114 --> 47:50.649
<i>And maybe he wasn't so bad after all.</i>

47:52.419 --> 47:54.956
<i>Things were looking up.</i>

47:55.156 --> 47:57.465
Good afternoon, Mrs. Busbee.

47:58.526 --> 48:02.030
I took the liberty of stopping by
today because I...

48:02.130 --> 48:05.199
I heard about your husband and...

48:05.299 --> 48:07.534
get your hat off.

48:08.136 --> 48:12.110
Mrs. Busbee, I want you
to know if you need anything,

48:12.210 --> 48:13.742
you can count on me.

48:15.509 --> 48:17.545
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

48:17.945 --> 48:19.714
Yeah.

48:20.314 --> 48:23.242
Boy, it smells good in here.

48:23.342 --> 48:26.904
Is that a casserole I smell?

48:27.504 --> 48:30.456
- It is.
- Yeah, I thought I could...

48:33.259 --> 48:35.294
Would you like to join us?

48:38.331 --> 48:39.498
Yeah.

48:41.968 --> 48:44.338
Seems Dr. Fox always gets what he wants.

48:45.382 --> 48:46.907
Dr. Fox?

48:47.007 --> 48:49.360
This is great. Thank you so much.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.426
Here we go.

48:59.886 --> 49:04.807
Emma... Freddy and I
haven't eaten like this since...

49:06.446 --> 49:08.827
well, Clarice passed.

49:24.245 --> 49:28.316
- Thank you for getting me out of jail.
- No trouble at all, son.

49:29.116 --> 49:31.652
I would do anything for your mother.

49:31.752 --> 49:34.410
That's my dad's seat, you know.

49:37.574 --> 49:39.360
I can see why.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.527
Best view in the house.

49:44.697 --> 49:48.748
- May I be excused?
- Yes, you may.

50:14.461 --> 50:16.191
Hey!

50:16.691 --> 50:18.294
What are you doing...

50:18.394 --> 50:21.836
I heard about your stupid "magic list."

50:22.639 --> 50:26.402
And if you want it back,
you're gonna have to get it from me.

50:48.595 --> 50:52.722
But that was the list...
the ancient list. I need that one.

50:52.822 --> 50:55.369
If you need it so bad,
take it back from him.

50:55.469 --> 50:58.206
How? He's bigger than me.

50:58.954 --> 51:01.692
Everybody's bigger than me.

51:08.214 --> 51:09.884
Okay, stand up.

51:10.284 --> 51:13.079
Let's see how small you are.

51:15.687 --> 51:17.425
Right.

51:17.525 --> 51:20.295
You're a very small boy, indeed.

51:20.795 --> 51:25.201
Toothpick arms, cricket legs...

51:25.301 --> 51:27.633
size of Masao Kume.

51:32.472 --> 51:35.250
- Who's Masao...
- Kume.

51:35.350 --> 51:37.876
- Samurai.
- What's that?

51:40.046 --> 51:42.994
You don't know what a samurai is?

51:45.985 --> 51:48.493
These are samurai...

51:48.593 --> 51:50.858
Japanese warriors.

51:50.958 --> 51:53.794
What one's Masao... Kume?

51:55.483 --> 51:57.148
This is Masao Kume.

51:57.248 --> 52:01.085
- He doesn't look like a warrior.
- He wasn't.

52:01.685 --> 52:03.451
Not yet.

52:13.412 --> 52:15.790
<i>Masao Kume was small.</i>

52:16.750 --> 52:18.766
<i>Powerless.</i>

52:19.253 --> 52:21.987
<i>Nothing but a servant.</i>

52:24.157 --> 52:27.161
But in every man's life,

52:27.261 --> 52:29.610
there comes a day of truth.

52:29.710 --> 52:35.957
And that day came
when the Mongols invaded Japan.

52:36.057 --> 52:38.286
Who are the Mongols?

52:38.386 --> 52:40.425
They were bullies.

52:43.022 --> 52:45.776
<i>Samurai tried to defend their land,</i>

52:45.976 --> 52:50.813
<i>but Mongols had "Bukha the Immense."</i>

53:28.525 --> 53:31.472
<i>The Mongols issued a challenge.</i>

53:31.572 --> 53:35.676
<i>If anyone could defeat Bukha in battle,</i>

53:35.776 --> 53:38.877
<i>they would leave Japan, never to return.</i>

54:10.460 --> 54:14.874
<i>Masao Kume believed
that nothing was more powerful...</i>

54:14.974 --> 54:16.748
<i>than the will.</i>

54:52.318 --> 54:55.387
The will to face one's fear...

54:56.990 --> 54:59.464
and to act.

55:06.766 --> 55:08.594
Stand.

55:10.303 --> 55:13.574
Now don't measure yourself
from here to the floor.

55:13.794 --> 55:17.462
Measure yourself from here to the sky.

55:19.532 --> 55:22.234
That makes you the tallest boy in town.

56:03.542 --> 56:07.744
Hey, Freddy. Look.
Someone's giving you the stink eye.

56:09.816 --> 56:11.802
Looking for something...

56:11.902 --> 56:13.737
Little Boy?

56:13.837 --> 56:17.558
Maybe this. It's a magic list, right?

56:17.658 --> 56:19.690
Give it back.

56:22.128 --> 56:23.995
Please?

56:35.840 --> 56:38.643
You fat motherless pig!

56:45.517 --> 56:48.872
- Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!
- This'll teach you to never mess with me.

56:49.272 --> 56:52.140
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy...

57:05.671 --> 57:08.122
I'm finishing you this time.

57:34.675 --> 57:36.871
"Invite a friend over."

57:37.671 --> 57:40.872
Feed the hungry also means
inviting a friend to eat.

57:59.510 --> 58:02.140
...whacked him so hard.

58:05.699 --> 58:07.642
I'll get it.

58:12.605 --> 58:15.246
Good day, Mrs. Busbee. I...

58:17.510 --> 58:21.048
I seem to have made a mistake.

58:22.110 --> 58:24.583
- Would you wait there a moment?
- Yes.

58:29.021 --> 58:32.423
I said for you to invite a friend.

58:33.558 --> 58:35.693
He is my friend.

58:42.468 --> 58:45.806
There's been no mistake.
Please come in, Mr. Hashimoto.

58:45.906 --> 58:48.439
Thank you, Mrs. Busbee.

58:57.115 --> 59:00.422
Do you have hot dogs
in Japan, Mr. Hashimoto?

59:01.483 --> 59:03.821
No, Mrs. Busbee.

59:08.927 --> 59:12.197
It's been 42 years
since I've been in Japan.

59:14.300 --> 59:16.652
Seems like a lifetime ago.

59:18.271 --> 59:20.273
And do you still have
relatives over there?

59:20.373 --> 59:23.424
All I have left
of all my relatives is a...

59:23.524 --> 59:26.200
photo of my two nephews...

59:26.300 --> 59:28.755
Takeshi and Koji.

59:33.252 --> 59:35.956
They probably live in my hometown still.

59:37.256 --> 59:39.757
Haven't heard from them since...

59:41.521 --> 59:43.873
The war changed everything.

59:46.232 --> 59:48.302
Yes, it has.

59:48.928 --> 59:50.423
For everyone.

59:53.472 --> 59:56.076
And did they send you away to the camps?

59:56.176 --> 01:00:01.479
- That is not the kind of question you ask.
- No, Mrs. Busbee, it's okay.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.086
It's simple.

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:09.083
I have the face of the enemy.

01:00:09.756 --> 01:00:12.692
Doesn't matter if this is my home.

01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:15.496
Doesn't matter if I love
this land, this country...

01:00:15.596 --> 01:00:20.098
Mom, where's that other set of keys?
That lamebrain Teacup forgot...

01:00:38.284 --> 01:00:42.353
- Maybe we should...
- Yes, I'll help you clean up.

01:00:42.922 --> 01:00:44.728
Thank you.

01:00:50.763 --> 01:00:52.660
Sorry.

01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:06.922
London?

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:10.017
London, what are you doing?
Put that down right now.

01:01:10.117 --> 01:01:12.853
London, put it down right now. Please?

01:01:12.953 --> 01:01:14.842
London, think about your dad.

01:01:14.942 --> 01:01:17.991
- Get out.
- London, think about what you're doing.

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.659
Please stop. Stop.

01:01:22.061 --> 01:01:23.773
Mrs. Busbee.

01:01:25.922 --> 01:01:26.970
Pepper.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:31.247
Get out now.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.672
Or I'll shoot you where you stand.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:39.565
Get out!

01:01:49.822 --> 01:01:53.596
A Jap will not eat at my father's table.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.829
This is all your fault!

01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:59.430
Dad had to go to war
because you couldn't!

01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:04.037
Listen to me. If I see you
hanging out with that rat,

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.905
- I will smack you in front of everyone...
- Enough!

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.899
- You need to stop this nonsense.
- Stop what?

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:18.985
Stop an eight-year-old boy from thinking
that he can do something to help his dad?

01:02:19.085 --> 01:02:21.521
Tell me, London,
what is so wrong with that?

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.574
Nothing.

01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:27.942
Except for when the day comes
to tell him the Japs killed his father.

01:02:29.095 --> 01:02:32.357
Stop saying your dad is dead.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.440
- Mom, I'm just trying to be prepared.
- Oh, shut up.

01:02:50.616 --> 01:02:52.578
Look at that.

01:02:59.024 --> 01:03:01.229
You should go home now.

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:04.097
Is this man bothering you?

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.132
No.

01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:07.568
He's my friend.

01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:11.571
Look, I have no business here with you.
All due respect, I'm going my way.

01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:14.639
With all due respect,
you're not going anywhere just yet.

01:03:16.508 --> 01:03:18.912
Am I a joke to you?

01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:22.119
Listen to me, if I see you around my brother
again, I will put a bullet in your head.

01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.213
- Do you understand me?
- That won't be needed.

01:03:24.313 --> 01:03:26.920
I think "Mr. Buddha-head"
here understands.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.788
You got one week to pack your crap
and get your yellow hide out of here.

01:03:32.691 --> 01:03:36.063
What, you don't believe me?
You stay and find out.

01:03:36.163 --> 01:03:37.840
Hey!

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.168
You want to do something for Dad,
then you stop palling around with this rat.

01:03:41.268 --> 01:03:43.687
Stupid priest filling your head
with a bunch of fairy tales.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:47.491
What if I can?
What if I can bring Dad back?

01:03:48.441 --> 01:03:50.276
Dad back?

01:03:50.376 --> 01:03:53.580
How? How are you gonna
bring Dad back, you idiot?

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.817
Like... like, with the mustard seed.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.938
You can "move a mountain."

01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:15.750
Fine.

01:04:19.538 --> 01:04:21.708
You want to move a mountain?
There's one. Go ahead.

01:04:21.808 --> 01:04:25.036
Move it. Move it!

01:04:27.313 --> 01:04:29.502
Move it for everyone!

01:04:29.602 --> 01:04:33.987
You don't have to do it.
He's just trying to humiliate you.

01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:37.630
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:40.026
Not now. No.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:41.614
Calm down.

01:05:11.098 --> 01:05:12.376
That's it.

01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:40.780
Do you know when Father Oliver's
coming back?

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.449
That's the little boy.

01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:45.767
This was much more
than just an earthquake.

01:06:45.867 --> 01:06:49.128
- What was it?
- It's a miracle.

01:06:51.524 --> 01:06:53.093
Let people believe what they want.

01:06:53.193 --> 01:06:57.264
They need crap like this to believe
that there's something bigger than them.

01:06:57.564 --> 01:07:01.332
Truth is, that earthquake would've happened
whether that boy was there or not.

01:07:03.336 --> 01:07:07.283
I've been walking to work for 35 years
and I'm telling you,

01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:10.844
that mountain was definitely...

01:07:11.344 --> 01:07:14.547
more to the right. Right?

01:07:15.081 --> 01:07:16.083
Father Oliver?

01:07:16.183 --> 01:07:18.685
What? What?
Yes, I heard about it on the...

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:22.287
- No, a boy moved a mountain.
- He moved a what?

01:07:52.351 --> 01:07:54.589
I figured it out!

01:07:55.388 --> 01:07:56.751
Hashimoto!

01:08:01.426 --> 01:08:05.765
Japan is practically straight
in front of us.

01:08:06.365 --> 01:08:09.269
Now if you point to where the sun
touches the sea,

01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:13.487
you'd be pointing directly at Japan.

01:08:17.908 --> 01:08:20.313
- Why the sudden interest?
- I need to end the war.

01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:23.590
My dad can't come back until it's over.

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:27.420
You mean doing this?

01:08:27.932 --> 01:08:29.189
Yes.

01:08:30.183 --> 01:08:33.075
All right, maybe it's time
I'm honest with you.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.161
I don't believe that you moved
any mountain

01:08:35.261 --> 01:08:37.464
or you had anything to do
with the earthquake.

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:40.399
You were there. How could you say that?

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.036
I just don't believe that anyone
in the world could do such a thing.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.975
Then are you saying I should stop?

01:08:54.747 --> 01:08:59.716
I would say do what makes sense for you.

01:09:14.032 --> 01:09:16.336
It's just a loan, for goodness' sake.

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:19.586
A loan from that Fox has enough strings
to start a puppet factory.

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:22.243
And what do you suggest, then?
Lose your father's shop?

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:27.279
We can pay him back
when your dad gets home.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:31.814
I think Dr. Fox is counting
on Dad never coming home.

01:09:33.118 --> 01:09:35.886
And his loan required you
to get all dolled up?

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:45.595
Today is me and your dad's
wedding anniversary.

01:09:57.175 --> 01:09:59.181
I'm sorry.

01:10:27.863 --> 01:10:30.441
What's Little Boy doing?

01:10:33.246 --> 01:10:36.751
I do believe men
can move mountains, Ollie.

01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:38.948
With dynamite.

01:10:40.419 --> 01:10:45.303
I believe that what happened to the mountain
can't be reduced to a game of chance.

01:10:46.859 --> 01:10:48.893
Much of life is a gamble, Ollie.

01:10:51.864 --> 01:10:54.500
You're advising a desperate child

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.137
who's ready to believe anything
that he is told.

01:10:58.237 --> 01:11:00.273
So tell me, Ollie...

01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:06.079
what happens when your imaginary friend
works in His mysterious ways...

01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:09.244
and his father dies?

01:11:10.082 --> 01:11:14.621
Then my "imaginary friend"
will also help him through it.

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:18.324
Tell the kid to stop.

01:11:18.424 --> 01:11:21.892
If he doesn't,
could lose faith in himself.

01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:24.929
That's what you should be
worrying about.

01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:51.548
- Said it in the papers.
- Little Boy.

01:12:52.851 --> 01:12:55.183
That's Little Boy!

01:12:58.456 --> 01:13:00.244
There he is!

01:13:00.344 --> 01:13:01.978
Little Boy's here.

01:13:02.328 --> 01:13:04.631
- You did it!
- You did it, son.

01:13:06.566 --> 01:13:08.602
Go on, go on, read it to him.

01:13:08.702 --> 01:13:10.638
Give me that.

01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:13.042
Listen to this, Little Boy.

01:13:13.142 --> 01:13:16.376
"The greatest power known to man
has been unleashed.

01:13:16.776 --> 01:13:19.412
Yesterday at 5:15 our time,

01:13:19.512 --> 01:13:23.433
Hiroshima was destroyed
by the force of the atomic bomb,

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.383
codename..."

01:13:27.718 --> 01:13:29.199
"Little Boy."

01:13:34.091 --> 01:13:36.379
- You did it.
- You did it.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:38.352
You did it.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.238
I did it!

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.971
My dad is coming home!

01:13:54.835 --> 01:13:56.713
I did it!

01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:03.653
- You did it, Little Boy.
- My dad is coming home.

01:14:08.761 --> 01:14:10.563
I did it!

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:13.325
My dad is coming home!

01:14:44.829 --> 01:14:47.545
Did they say when Dad's coming back?

01:14:54.839 --> 01:14:57.643
I wish things were that simple.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:02.515
Colonel Bob said that...

01:15:03.115 --> 01:15:06.452
the bomb may not be good
for American prisoners.

01:15:08.069 --> 01:15:09.556
What do you mean?

01:15:09.656 --> 01:15:14.691
It means that the Japanese may try to harm
your dad in revenge for the bomb.

01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:19.290
It wiped out an entire city.

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:01.739
Hello, Hashimoto.

01:17:04.803 --> 01:17:06.891
I warned you.

01:17:06.991 --> 01:17:09.402
But you dared stay.

01:17:11.343 --> 01:17:13.729
And looking on the bright side,

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.959
I...

01:17:16.059 --> 01:17:18.542
ended up doing you a favor.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:24.077
It's imprudent... to keep all these
traitorous Japanese souvenirs.

01:17:26.025 --> 01:17:30.565
Since we are at war against Japan.

01:17:31.329 --> 01:17:36.033
It was evil rats just like you
who cowardly murdered my son.

01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:47.744
The yellow fella
don't take a hint, does he?

01:17:55.353 --> 01:17:57.591
Doing this...

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:02.192
won't bring back your son.

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:18.800
Sam.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.372
Sam, that's enough, Sam!

01:18:27.883 --> 01:18:30.004
Let's get outta here.

01:18:30.265 --> 01:18:31.737
Now!

01:18:35.186 --> 01:18:36.963
Sam.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:40.166
Sam, we can't... we can't just
leave him in there. He's gonna die.

01:18:40.266 --> 01:18:43.736
If we're caught here and he dies,
we rot in jail. Do you understand me?

01:18:44.552 --> 01:18:48.261
Get in the truck. Get in the truck now!

01:18:54.712 --> 01:18:58.851
Okay, you wanna play the hero?
That's your choice.

01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:03.586
But you better be man enough
to face the consequences on your own.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.338
How is he?

01:19:42.126 --> 01:19:46.931
- His heart is very weak.
- But he's gonna be okay, right?

01:19:52.236 --> 01:19:54.302
I don't know.

01:20:39.388 --> 01:20:41.234
<i>You have to let one die.</i>

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.697
<i>Make your choice.</i>

01:20:59.404 --> 01:21:01.615
Hashimoto.

01:21:01.715 --> 01:21:03.910
Hashimoto?

01:21:10.548 --> 01:21:12.471
Pepper.

01:21:21.092 --> 01:21:22.895
Nurse!

01:21:22.995 --> 01:21:25.965
- Get the doctor.
- Dr. Foley!

01:21:26.565 --> 01:21:28.751
- I need oxygen.
- Right away.

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:33.253
Mr. Hashimoto, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

01:21:39.777 --> 01:21:41.958
He's stopped breathing.

01:21:44.782 --> 01:21:46.792
Please don't die.

01:24:25.993 --> 01:24:27.288
You're free.

01:24:27.388 --> 01:24:30.865
The Jap dropped the charges.
Says you saved his life.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:34.420
Whatever that means.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.853
Ma'am.

01:25:57.268 --> 01:25:59.362
It's time.

01:26:05.276 --> 01:26:09.479
<i>We were told my father
was laid to rest in the Philippines.</i>

01:26:12.116 --> 01:26:15.288
<i>My mother still chose to have
a memorial for him back home.</i>

01:26:15.388 --> 01:26:19.058
Let us commit James L. Busbee's
body to the ground,

01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:22.411
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:24.713
dust to dust,

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:27.660
in the sure and certain hope

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.070
of the resurrection to eternal life.

01:26:32.434 --> 01:26:35.841
In the name of the Father and of the Son

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:37.618
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:26:37.718 --> 01:26:39.615
Amen.

01:28:13.337 --> 01:28:15.836
You're my only partner.

01:28:57.548 --> 01:28:59.277
Do you mind if I sit here?

01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.906
You know, I...

01:29:21.006 --> 01:29:24.241
never got to say goodbye to my wife.

01:29:25.976 --> 01:29:28.914
By the time I got to the hospital,

01:29:29.014 --> 01:29:31.248
she was already in a coma.

01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:39.540
She died the next morning.

01:29:49.299 --> 01:29:53.441
I think it was stupid of me
to believe that a midget like me

01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:56.475
could bring my dad back
with some stupid list.

01:29:56.575 --> 01:29:58.277
It was not stupid.

01:29:58.877 --> 01:30:01.636
It takes courage to believe.

01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:07.884
Your father would be more
than proud of you.

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:15.616
All the love you have for him
was contained in that list.

01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:31.713
I did this for you.

01:32:05.602 --> 01:32:08.540
39 inches. Same as before.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.521
I'm afraid I still don't have a...

01:32:10.621 --> 01:32:13.512
a diagnosis
for his irregular development,

01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:16.548
but I do have some theories.

01:32:16.648 --> 01:32:19.301
Maybe I could come over the house...

01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:22.236
later and we could discuss them.

01:32:23.034 --> 01:32:24.809
Perhaps tonight?

01:32:24.909 --> 01:32:27.893
I really appreciate the help
you've given us.

01:32:27.993 --> 01:32:29.878
I really do,

01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:32.164
but right now,

01:32:32.264 --> 01:32:34.533
my family needs some time alone.

01:32:35.233 --> 01:32:39.295
- Maybe after some time...
- You're a good man, Dr. Fox.

01:32:39.395 --> 01:32:43.455
But I will always be Mrs. James Busbee.

01:32:47.311 --> 01:32:49.112
Come on.

01:33:54.479 --> 01:33:57.149
- I need more bandages!
- What's the name on this one?

01:33:58.205 --> 01:34:00.086
I got him, I got him.

01:34:00.186 --> 01:34:02.453
Get that on his head!

01:34:02.553 --> 01:34:07.456
"James L. Busbee... 39627771."

01:34:32.349 --> 01:34:35.351
You did it, you little runt. You did it.

01:34:42.192 --> 01:34:43.123
London!

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:08.451
<i>Father Oliver said God was responsible
for bringing my dad back.</i>

01:35:12.256 --> 01:35:16.294
<i>Hashimoto said it was
my father's will to live.</i>

01:35:16.994 --> 01:35:20.562
He survived an extremely severe trauma.

01:35:21.331 --> 01:35:23.153
<i>Me?</i>

01:35:25.302 --> 01:35:28.616
<i>Oh, I was holding on
to my mustard seed...</i>

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:32.845
<i>because the journey was not over yet.</i>

01:35:49.426 --> 01:35:51.460
Partner?

01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:57.818
I got the boots you really wanted.

01:36:15.552 --> 01:36:17.949
It's me, partner.

01:36:48.902 --> 01:36:50.765
Partner.

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:57.921
