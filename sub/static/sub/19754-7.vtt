WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.440
Her name is Melanie Jaswinsky.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.978
Single shot, small caliber,

00:11.979 --> 00:13.479
point blank to the throat.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.581
The last thing she saw
on God's green earth

00:15.583 --> 00:17.150
was her killer's face.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.851
I hope it was good-looking.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.987
Purse was found near the body.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.818
One of those big satchel jobs.

00:22.823 --> 00:23.963
Contents were gone.

00:23.964 --> 00:26.657
Lab found traces of cocaine,

00:26.660 --> 00:27.994
yellowish in color.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.725
The good shit.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.130
Drug deal went south?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.502
No prints, no witnesses,
no weapon.

00:33.503 --> 00:37.108
We got nothing but a pretty
girl with a hole in her throat.

00:37.109 --> 00:38.505
Kick it over to Narcotics.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.236
City controller
is busting my stones

00:40.241 --> 00:42.841
on all the overtime hours
logged last pay period.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.043
All right.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.788
Hey, out there in
radioland, you're listening

00:52.789 --> 00:54.286
to the best station in Stockton.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.657
Don't touch that dial.

00:55.658 --> 00:58.156
The station that makes
you want to listen.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.359
Here's what's happening.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.032
A 39-year-old unidentified man

01:04.033 --> 01:05.669
went berserk last night...

01:05.670 --> 01:07.396
- Where are you?
- Car broke down.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.171
What am I supposed to do
until you get here?

01:09.172 --> 01:10.370
You have to stall.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.439
Wilson, don't wait for Apex.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.870
I need you to get in your car...

01:13.874 --> 01:15.144
Too late. He's here.

01:15.145 --> 01:16.943
Stay on the line.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.750
Are not
releasing any information

01:18.751 --> 01:20.746
until they complete
their investigation.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.978
- You Apex?
- Got the money?

01:22.983 --> 01:24.253
It's on the way.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.064
Suspect's death.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

02:06.527 --> 02:08.426
Aah!

03:11.592 --> 03:14.261
Pernell! Wake up, man.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.262
- What?
- Goodbye.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.727
What are you, fucking nuts?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.374
Yeah, that's real funny
coming from you.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.940
- Yeah. Get out of my house.
- Hey...

03:26.340 --> 03:27.874
You gave me three fucking days.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.435
Well, I'm taking them back,
just like you took

03:29.443 --> 03:31.611
your support
for the name change, Judas.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.552
Judas?

03:32.553 --> 03:33.876
Judas Iscariot with a lariat.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.350
You hung me out to dry.

03:35.351 --> 03:36.649
"Anything for a friend," right.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.950
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.390
You think I fucking
want to be here?

03:40.391 --> 03:41.818
I got no place else to go

03:41.822 --> 03:44.122
since you told Crystal
about Olinari.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.794
That's what this is about?

03:45.795 --> 03:47.699
You big baby, you're going
to put that on me?

03:47.700 --> 03:50.425
You swore your silence.
Now she's God knows where.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.431
Because she got a buffoon
for a husband...

03:52.433 --> 03:55.067
An old man
on a messed-up acid trip.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.438
You drove her away, not me.

03:56.439 --> 03:59.007
I had a shot, Bobo.
You took that away.

03:59.008 --> 04:01.476
Look, no more talking,
all right? Just get out.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.882
Mind if I put
some fucking pants on?

04:05.883 --> 04:06.909
I don't care what you do.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.681
Ask Elvis or
Man In the Moon over there

04:08.682 --> 04:10.352
if they want to see
your pants on or off.

04:10.353 --> 04:11.720
You do whatever you want.

04:11.721 --> 04:13.319
I'm going to do
what the fuck I want.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.590
Yeah, yeah.
You can eat my food, right?

04:15.591 --> 04:17.589
You can leave your
pubic hairs on my soap.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.891
You can sit there
with your totem pole face

04:19.892 --> 04:21.062
in front of my TV.

04:21.063 --> 04:22.499
I don't care. But you know what?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.826
If I come home from work
and you're still here,

04:24.832 --> 04:27.972
I'll be calling 911 and telling
them I shot an intruder.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.902
Get the fuck out of here.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.519
Crystal?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.532
Honey, are you hurt?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
She's dead.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.029
Wilson's dead.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.800
It's a he.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.367
Wilson's dead.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.899
Okay, Crys.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.641
You got a little hickey
from the,

05:04.642 --> 05:06.568
from the air bag. Can you stand?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.841
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.442
I'm going to help you
stand, okay?

05:10.444 --> 05:12.084
Come on. Stand up, baby.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.181
Okay.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.452
Come on.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.818
I'm taking you home.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.787
I can't leave her.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.388
Him. Yeah, we can.
We're going to, okay?

05:23.391 --> 05:24.891
I'm going to call
Wildlife Control.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.062
You get in the car, okay?
I'll be right back.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.400
Trim's going to get
another coat.

05:30.401 --> 05:31.967
You're never satisfied, are you?

05:31.968 --> 05:34.395
We're almost there.
We're getting there.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.839
Just got a few little touchups.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.466
Gonna replace the strike plates,

05:37.471 --> 05:38.740
light switch covers.

05:38.741 --> 05:40.769
- Hey.
- It should be done today.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.409
It looks beautiful.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.480
S-So what are you going
to do with it?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.181
I'm going to put it
on the market.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.782
I'm sure it'll go pretty quick.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.622
This neighborhood's on the rise.

05:52.623 --> 05:54.320
So it's not going to be for you?

05:54.321 --> 05:56.761
I got my dream house
in escrow, KD.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.856
I don't mind if you stay
here until it sells.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.432
I appreciate that.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.104
Hey, I, um...

06:09.837 --> 06:11.704
This is for you.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.705
No. That wasn't the deal.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.237
- You know that.
- I know that.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.542
I know, but I thought about it,

06:16.544 --> 06:17.912
and you've got this place
looking better

06:17.913 --> 06:19.211
- than before the fire.
- I'm not...

06:19.212 --> 06:20.447
I think it's fair.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.618
I'm not taking your money.

06:21.619 --> 06:23.545
Put it towards a new truck.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.486
My truck... My truck fits me.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.287
It barely runs.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.288
But...

06:30.290 --> 06:31.830
Don't you want something nicer?

06:37.931 --> 06:40.731
When I first got out of prison,

06:40.734 --> 06:43.244
I went to the state fair
in Sacramento.

06:43.245 --> 06:45.536
Fairly cheap. The food was good.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.369
Lot of people smiling.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.684
It was good for an inmate
who taught himself not to.

06:50.685 --> 06:52.645
I'll bet.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.146
They were raffling off
this new Cadillac.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.478
5 bucks a ticket.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.194
The money was gonna fund
some youth center,

06:58.195 --> 07:01.585
so I bought two, and I won.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.055
Wow.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.116
So you're lucky.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.758
Well, I was that day.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.028
It was a compact one,
but it was real nice.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.497
What happened to it?

07:10.498 --> 07:12.828
Well, I drove it a lot.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.173
And I slept in it
a couple of times,

07:15.174 --> 07:16.836
and I played the stereo.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.737
It was the nicest thing
I ever owned.

07:18.739 --> 07:22.575
But about a month after
they brought it to me,

07:22.576 --> 07:24.646
I ran it into the back
of this Spanish guy's truck.

07:24.647 --> 07:27.045
Didn't mess it up too bad.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.416
I didn't have insurance,
and I was drunk,

07:31.418 --> 07:34.518
so I just traded him.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.022
Well, no wonder
you quit drinking.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.594
Drinking didn't have
much to do with it.

07:38.595 --> 07:40.692
I probably would have
given it away sober.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.797
I have a hard time

07:44.798 --> 07:46.698
holding on to nice things.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.241
And...

08:03.684 --> 08:05.854
- What?
- I need you to call Olinari.

08:05.855 --> 08:07.923
Say whatever it takes
to get him here.

08:07.924 --> 08:09.155
Okay.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.116
I'm serious.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.963
Okay, but you really
need to see this.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.766
Somebody do something!

08:19.767 --> 08:21.597
And no matter how hard you hit

08:21.602 --> 08:23.302
or how far you run,

08:23.303 --> 08:25.004
there's no escaping Him...

08:25.005 --> 08:27.874
Not for me, not for you,
not for anyone...

08:27.875 --> 08:30.135
Because you've been found!
You've been found!

08:31.779 --> 08:33.409
There he is.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.748
Worldstar sensation.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.684
I guess, like a half
million other people,

08:38.686 --> 08:40.216
he's already seen it.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.457
Tell me he's not going
to press charges.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.656
That's the least of my concerns.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.226
You mind?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.657
Judge Stanton
just denied our motion

08:49.663 --> 08:51.230
to postpone voir dire.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.400
But hey, all the evidence
is circumstantial.

08:54.401 --> 08:58.204
Me versus McCauley
on the likeability scale,

08:58.205 --> 08:59.465
no contest.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.742
I'm not making guarantees,

09:00.743 --> 09:01.941
but shit,

09:01.942 --> 09:05.011
I have pulled off
miracles before.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.512
But then...

09:07.514 --> 09:08.615
there's you.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.016
I've heard all this before.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.787
I'm going to be dancing
around sketchy DNA,

09:12.788 --> 09:14.886
poking holes
in witness testimony,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.518
but the jurors aren't
going to care

09:16.523 --> 09:18.492
because they're going
to be looking at you

09:18.493 --> 09:19.961
and thinking about the video

09:19.962 --> 09:23.395
where you punched
a preacher in the face.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.996
You think she loves me?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.168
- What?
- Crystal.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.836
I'm not exactly the guy

09:29.837 --> 09:31.297
you should be asking that
question to.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.774
Come on, Nick.
You know her. You talk to her.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.775
Love or not, she doesn't
want to be with you.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.178
I don't see that changing.

09:41.782 --> 09:45.222
I talked to Olinari.
He'll be here in an hour.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.188
We give them our data,

09:49.189 --> 09:52.189
and they make chains
that fit us better.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.265
I created Bathwater as an answer

09:59.266 --> 10:03.396
to help us break those chains.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.743
Coming in or what?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.437
If they can't track us,
they can't control us.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.576
Hey.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.807
If they can't control us...

10:11.812 --> 10:14.212
Uch. Fucking dog schmutz
is on everything.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.424
Where are you going?

10:15.425 --> 10:19.615
I just got to get out
of town for a little bit.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.919
I need to not...
Not be here, you know?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.891
J, what is that?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.760
That's PJ's manifesto. Sorry.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.430
Did Pernell ever see that?

10:29.431 --> 10:31.329
I don't know. I don't think so.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.267
What is it?

10:38.271 --> 10:40.211
Nothing.
It just sounds familiar.

10:42.810 --> 10:46.910
Well, it did explode online
after PJ died, so...

10:46.914 --> 10:50.482
Yeah. That's what it was.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.886
You... You okay
hearing PJ's voice?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.917
I don't know about okay,

10:55.923 --> 10:57.933
but that's the PJ
that I remember, you know,

10:57.934 --> 11:00.425
before everything...

11:00.427 --> 11:01.797
happened.

11:03.196 --> 11:08.866
He cared so much
about everything, and...

11:10.537 --> 11:11.737
that's the guy that I remember.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.439
That's the guy that surprised me

11:13.440 --> 11:14.809
on our first anniversary.

11:14.810 --> 11:16.177
I was having lunch with my mom,

11:16.178 --> 11:17.846
and he showed up
in a gorilla suit

11:17.847 --> 11:20.605
to tell me that he's
ape shit about me.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.282
Yeah, that was the PJ I knew.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.023
That's the PJ
that I thought I knew.

11:25.024 --> 11:27.887
I just think I need
to listen to that

11:27.888 --> 11:29.588
so I can remember who he was.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.019
I just need to hear it
over and over.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.794
Maybe that's because
you loved him, J.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.367
It was a little breakdown.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.078
What do you want, Pernell?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.219
I want my wife back.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.089
I was going to lie and say

12:07.094 --> 12:08.863
the blood didn't lift
from your blouse

12:08.864 --> 12:10.200
and keep it for myself,

12:10.201 --> 12:12.166
but since Bambi
fucked up your Beemer,

12:12.167 --> 12:14.225
I figured you could
use some good news.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.106
Mom, the cable's out.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.167
Hold on.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.079
Crystal, what are you
doing here?

12:24.080 --> 12:26.607
Pernell is following me around

12:26.613 --> 12:28.180
like a lost puppy.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.621
I just needed a break
from everything.

12:30.622 --> 12:32.417
This might cheer you up.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.619
PJ's manifesto,

12:34.621 --> 12:36.261
it's up to 400,000 views.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.387
You have any luck
finding Bathwater?

12:40.861 --> 12:42.294
No.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.225
What about that hacker
you told me about?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.201
Wilson. She couldn't help?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.839
All right. We're
going for a ride.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.108
Call the cable guy.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.210
And no smoking. Come on.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.850
Come on.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.559
I want to stop by
my dad's before lunch.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.026
I'll be ready in about 20.

13:12.027 --> 13:13.525
- You got it, sir.
- Thank you.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.768
You coming with me to
this museum thing, right?

13:22.769 --> 13:24.269
I might miss that, Pop.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.871
Why?

13:25.873 --> 13:28.307
Dad, you believe in God, right?

13:28.308 --> 13:31.008
It depends on who's asking.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.748
I mean, if it's the AMC Mafia,

13:32.749 --> 13:34.575
then hallelujah,
praise the Lord.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.921
Pass the blank check.

13:35.922 --> 13:38.786
I'm serious. Do you believe?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.489
- If there's a God.
- Yes.

13:41.490 --> 13:44.018
Sure. Because I still
can't figure out

13:44.024 --> 13:45.661
how the hell we got here.

13:45.662 --> 13:47.428
But do I wake up and pray? No.

13:47.429 --> 13:49.957
Do I believe
karma's a bitch? Yes.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.233
Do I live my life
based on the Good Book?

13:52.234 --> 13:54.901
Well, you know
the answer to that.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.372
Where's this coming from?

13:56.373 --> 13:57.399
I'm thinking.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.406
You know how I've been saying

14:00.407 --> 14:02.407
you should distance
yourself from Pernell...

14:02.409 --> 14:05.044
Mostly because his whole
religious trip

14:05.045 --> 14:06.745
had me thinking he had
gone off the deep end?

14:06.746 --> 14:08.114
He has.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.715
Yeah, but what if
there's something to it?

14:09.716 --> 14:12.184
The God thing, I mean.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.685
The man didn't just start
going to church, okay?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.056
He says he's having visions.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.287
Thinks God is telling him
to do shit.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.992
You always have
to boil the taste

14:20.994 --> 14:22.234
out of everything,
don't you, Dad?

14:22.235 --> 14:23.559
Now you sound like your mother.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.133
Well, maybe I should
go talk to her, then.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.368
About what?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.039
Damn, son, all right, come on.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.640
Pull back the curtain
and start the show.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.108
Do you remember a recording

14:37.110 --> 14:38.680
of Pernell speaking tongues
in a fountain?

14:38.681 --> 14:41.078
How can I forget?
We got that show on repeat.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.319
What Pernell was saying
on that recording, Dad,

14:43.320 --> 14:45.686
sounds a lot like
a manifesto that PJ made

14:45.687 --> 14:47.145
before he died, okay?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.192
It's different words,
but it's the s...

14:49.193 --> 14:50.758
Okay, enough of the bullcrap.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.187
You've been wanting
that gibberish

14:52.192 --> 14:53.592
to make sense from the start.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.760
Why, I don't know.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.201
Maybe your mom is,
guilt tripping you.

14:56.202 --> 14:57.226
But look, I don't care.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.965
If that...

14:58.966 --> 15:00.166
If that's starting
to make sense,

15:00.167 --> 15:01.527
it's because you want it to.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.074
So you say that without
even listening to it?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.379
I say that knowing
how people are.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.475
If you want something
to be true bad enough,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.250
you'll make it true
in your head.

15:16.251 --> 15:17.779
Dad, I'm telling you
what I heard

15:17.784 --> 15:19.524
and what I saw. That's real.

15:19.525 --> 15:22.754
Pernell heard voices
and saw signs in his head

15:22.755 --> 15:25.024
that told him,
if he did certain things,

15:25.025 --> 15:27.025
PJ would wake up.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.257
And he was a lot
more convinced than you.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.432
But I seem to remember
the two of us

15:31.433 --> 15:33.001
standing on a cliff at Big Sur

15:33.002 --> 15:36.168
while the Harrises
dumped PJ's ashes.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.599
That ring a bell?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.335
Damn it.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.631
You didn't name that
dead deer Wilson, did you?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.030
No.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.714
You... You kill Wilson, too?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.676
Like the deer?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.049
No.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.680
I didn't do it.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.587
I'm just responsible for it.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.466
Hi. I'm Gordie from TruCal.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.969
You called about your cable.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.239
- That was quick.
- We...

16:45.240 --> 16:47.408
We had a cancellation
down the road.

16:47.409 --> 16:50.237
Some guy must have
pounded on his cable box,

16:50.243 --> 16:53.212
and voilà, "Ice Road
Truckers" is back on.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.481
Okay. Well, come on in.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.352
All right.

16:56.353 --> 16:57.879
It's hot out there today.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.494
Toasty, toasty, scorcher.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.591
Does that actually work?

17:02.592 --> 17:03.719
What's that?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.223
Pounding on the box.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.095
It works. Just don't do it.
I'll be out of a job.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.232
Okay, well,
I'll be in the kitchen

17:11.233 --> 17:13.671
- if you need me.
- Okey-dokey.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.407
Hey, you want
something to drink?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.614
Dirty martini, three olives.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.975
Yeah, I wish.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.651
No, I'm good.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.452
Thank you.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.554
Can I use your bathroom?

18:08.555 --> 18:10.215
Yeah, sure. It's
just off to the left.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.357
T-To the left.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.828
Yeah. Right and then left.

18:32.312 --> 18:37.449
Hippocrates called it
the sacred disease.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.950
But a lot of scientists,
including me,

18:39.952 --> 18:43.689
believe that the prophets
and seers in the old days

18:43.690 --> 18:48.527
were actually people suffering
from temporal lobe epilepsy.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.528
They thought they were
having divine visions

18:51.531 --> 18:53.531
and... and hearing holy voices,

18:53.533 --> 18:56.668
but really it was
their brain in hyper mode.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.438
My visions revealed things
I never could have known,

18:59.439 --> 19:01.839
took me places I never
could have found on my own.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.309
It may seem that way,

19:03.310 --> 19:05.480
but then they wouldn't
call it sacred disease

19:05.481 --> 19:07.008
if it wasn't special.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.814
This wasn't just kooks.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.485
Sir Isaac Newton was said
to be afflicted by it.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.687
I believe that you were capable

19:15.688 --> 19:16.918
of seeing patterns

19:16.923 --> 19:19.533
and making connections
that normal people can't

19:19.534 --> 19:22.756
because your brain was
filling in the blanks

19:22.762 --> 19:25.764
between your subconscious
and the conscious.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.365
So...

19:27.367 --> 19:29.467
me and Isaac Newton?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.773
I can't remember
my fucking PIN code.

19:32.774 --> 19:34.005
There was...

19:34.006 --> 19:35.436
There was a kid.

19:35.442 --> 19:39.245
He would glance at a page
in the encyclopedia,

19:39.246 --> 19:43.515
and he would recite it
verbatim in seconds.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.516
One day I took him on a walk,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.248
and when we got back,

19:47.254 --> 19:49.888
he could tell me
the license plate

19:49.889 --> 19:52.119
of every car we passed,

19:52.124 --> 19:54.260
moving or parked.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.295
But, on the other hand,

19:56.296 --> 19:58.326
he wasn't able
to maintain friendships

19:58.331 --> 20:01.331
or function in school
or connect with his parents,

20:01.334 --> 20:04.169
and that is why
it is called a disease

20:04.170 --> 20:05.200
and not a gift.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.442
But you can fix it, right?

20:06.443 --> 20:07.708
I know you're excited,

20:07.709 --> 20:09.637
but try and stay still, Mr.
Harris.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.679
Yes. Temporal lobe epilepsy
can be controlled.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.780
Why didn't we think
about doing this earlier?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.720
Because it only makes sense now.

20:17.721 --> 20:19.086
You could have spared yourself

20:19.087 --> 20:20.515
a lot of grief and frustration

20:20.520 --> 20:22.760
if you had told me
about your God issues

20:22.761 --> 20:24.215
from the start.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.525
Honesty is our friend, judge.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.826
Now I have you hooked up
to a video EEG.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.059
As soon as
a hallucination kicks in,

20:32.064 --> 20:36.201
we will see the activity
here in your temporal lobe.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.571
Just relax.
This is only a formality.

20:39.572 --> 20:43.775
But we have to do it to make
the diagnosis official.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.636
All right?

20:44.644 --> 20:47.214
And then
we will make you better.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.581
I'll take those for you.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.627
- Hi, there.
- Hello, darling.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.194
There she was, my Kay,

21:03.195 --> 21:04.625
the darling of my heart.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.197
I couldn't yet believe

21:06.198 --> 21:07.528
she was a married woman.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.340
She still seemed
like a kid to me

21:09.341 --> 21:10.696
playing at keeping house.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.841
How are you?
You feeling all right?

21:12.842 --> 21:14.509
Feeling all right? Look at her.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.687
Why are you in here?

21:28.688 --> 21:32.558
The line runs through here.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.959
Just need to detect
for any issues.

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
You like gnomes.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.635
Right? My mom loved gnomes.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.707
Mother was a gnome addict.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.738
Gnome-atic.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.811
Had them all over the house.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.816
Guard gnomes to sneaky
little garden gnomes.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.617
Said they were for protection,

21:59.619 --> 22:01.589
but when I was a kid...

22:03.556 --> 22:06.426
they just used to freak me out.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.560
I always felt like I
was being watched.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.407
Here it is.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.906
Well, I should be done.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.412
I just need to...

22:28.415 --> 22:29.915
Yeah. We're good.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.746
Hopefully you don't have
to see me any time soon.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.290
You know, that poster was
actually a gift from my mom.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.726
Maybe he is spying.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.594
Put some tape on its eyes.

22:42.595 --> 22:46.425
That's what I used to do.
You'll be fine.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.737
Have a nice day.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.452
Does anybody else
know besides Pernell?

23:07.454 --> 23:08.820
Wilson.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.559
But that doesn't matter anymore.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.587
And you don't know
who killed her.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.260
We set up a meeting
with this guy

23:15.261 --> 23:17.231
who was supposed
to give us this key

23:17.232 --> 23:20.466
so we could decode
PJ's software.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.227
I never made it there.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.104
Okay, wait.
If you weren't there,

23:26.105 --> 23:27.465
how do you know she died?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.476
Because I was
on the phone with her

23:30.477 --> 23:31.477
when it happened.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.248
I heard the whole fucking thing.

23:33.249 --> 23:34.475
Jesus.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.951
And you don't know who did it?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.820
And now I don't know
if they're after me.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.999
Come on, baby.

23:59.071 --> 23:59.941
Come here, boy.

23:59.942 --> 24:01.609
Come here. Come here, come here.

24:01.610 --> 24:02.908
How are you, Moonlight?

24:02.909 --> 24:04.776
Yes, that's a good boy.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.577
I hope you're sure about this.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.079
I'm... I'm sure, I'm sure.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.580
I'm just happy
that he was still there.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.684
Mommy's really lucky, right?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.045
So is Moonlight.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.123
He was scheduled to be
euthanized this evening.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.387
Good boy.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.891
Does Pernell know about Wilson?

24:20.893 --> 24:23.033
Denise?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.898
I mean, you know, he's
a big mouth and an asshole,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.540
but he might be able
to help you with this.

24:29.541 --> 24:30.736
- He's not all there.
- Hey.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.137
Sorry for the wait.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.338
I'm Eric from TruCal.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.939
Called about your cable.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.775
It's fixed.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.376
You mean it's working now?

24:38.377 --> 24:39.547
Yeah, the guy was already here.

24:39.548 --> 24:41.046
What guy?

24:41.047 --> 24:42.377
As far as I know,

24:42.381 --> 24:43.721
I'm the only technician
in the area.

24:43.722 --> 24:45.686
Gordie, the one with the beard.

24:45.687 --> 24:47.245
Did he give you a work order?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.253
Denise?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.087
I don't think so.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.759
Well,

24:53.760 --> 24:55.829
maybe they dispatched
somebody else.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.098
As long as it's working,
have a great day.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.783
I didn't ask you to bug you

25:15.784 --> 25:17.382
or to, to hound you

25:17.383 --> 25:19.393
about giving me a second chance.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.485
I just want to let you know.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.488
I spoke to Olinari.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.590
The news couldn't be better.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.193
He says he can fix me.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.764
Turns out I'm not
the God Whisperer after all.

25:30.765 --> 25:33.364
I have temporal lobe epilepsy.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.234
- Pernell...
- No, listen.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.165
Before you speak,
just let me say something.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.106
Napoleon, Julius Caesar,
George Gershwin...

25:41.107 --> 25:42.607
They all had it.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.679
And...

25:45.244 --> 25:47.114
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.122
Concentrate, Pernell.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.915
Pernell.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.955
I'm pregnant.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.961
We're having a baby.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.660
My...

26:05.698 --> 26:07.668
My God.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.748
Pernell. Pernell.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.945
It's time.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.839
Congratulations.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.334
You said they didn't know
if they were after you?

28:17.335 --> 28:18.864
Look at these.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.895
They're after you.

28:20.900 --> 28:25.236
And whoever did this
heard everything we said.

28:25.237 --> 28:28.407
So I need to know
what you were thinking.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.676
I'm next. I know I'm next.

28:31.677 --> 28:34.577
Okay. Then you have got
to go back.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.780
You have got to go
to the police.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.304
I'm still trying
to wrap my mind around

28:50.305 --> 28:55.066
why you brought Shane Caldwell
in for questioning.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.797
Pernell asked a favor.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.109
I didn't know where
he was going to take me.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.605
So if you get
called in to testify,

29:00.606 --> 29:01.636
why can't you just say that?

29:01.640 --> 29:02.908
It's complicated.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.609
Yeah. I figured that.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.445
So I did a little digging,

29:07.446 --> 29:09.014
and I found this.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.515
The same day that Shane Caldwell

29:11.517 --> 29:13.147
was called in for questioning,

29:13.152 --> 29:16.988
an eminent domain order for
the Valco tract was signed

29:16.989 --> 29:19.089
by Pernell Harris.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.460
You needed that to go through

29:20.461 --> 29:21.889
for the Brooks deal, didn't you?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.232
You doing an interview
or a deposition?

29:23.233 --> 29:24.059
I'm just trying

29:24.063 --> 29:25.533
to do my job, Mayor Boston.

29:29.936 --> 29:33.966
Can we just give this "mayor fly on the
wall" thing a break for a few hours?

29:33.973 --> 29:37.313
Just be us? Bobo and Izzy?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.112
Okay.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.884
Stay there..

29:45.885 --> 29:47.585
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.716
Is that... Now you want
a backrub, like...

29:49.721 --> 29:51.361
I want you to rub something.

29:51.362 --> 29:53.724
Would you rub something?

29:53.725 --> 29:55.125
A little rub and tug.

29:57.596 --> 30:01.426
Today is a No Excuses day.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.101
I want you to make a list

30:03.102 --> 30:05.702
of all the things you ever
wanted to do in your life

30:05.704 --> 30:07.973
but have never got around to.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.214
And then I want you
to make a choice.

30:10.215 --> 30:12.809
Will this be a list of regrets,

30:12.811 --> 30:15.611
or will it be a list
of things to look forward to.

30:15.614 --> 30:19.784
Now, if you're a Christian,
you already know the answer.

30:19.785 --> 30:24.655
If you've been found,
you already know the answer.

30:29.795 --> 30:34.525
Wow. That was...
powerful. Really.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.595
Is that going to be
your thing now?

30:38.604 --> 30:39.871
YouTube videos?

30:39.872 --> 30:42.507
Whatever it takes
to reach people.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.408
Well, you hooked me.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.078
I saw your other one
on Worldstar...

30:47.079 --> 30:48.409
The one where you
took a beating.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.854
And it made you want
to come to church.

30:50.855 --> 30:52.617
It did.

30:52.618 --> 30:57.518
You know what my favorite
part about it was?

30:57.523 --> 31:00.291
The van in the background.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.730
You see, we've got this witness

31:01.731 --> 31:04.957
who saw Pernell Harris
dump Shane Caldwell's body.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.474
He said that our friend
was in a blue van

31:07.475 --> 31:08.996
with a bird on it.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.270
Now, I have to say
that I'm ashamed to admit

31:12.271 --> 31:14.041
that we couldn't figure it out.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.344
And then I saw the video.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.477
Connecting you to the van

31:20.479 --> 31:21.748
that Pernell was driving

31:21.749 --> 31:24.217
throws preacher confidentiality
out the window.

31:24.218 --> 31:26.586
So now, when we put you
on the stand,

31:26.587 --> 31:27.745
it'll be as an accomplice.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.263
We let our church members

31:29.264 --> 31:31.455
borrow that van all the time.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.263
Excuse me.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.234
Hey, Keith,
what are you doing here?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.265
I was... I wondered if I could
talk with Reverend Paul.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.009
He's working on
his sermon right now,

31:47.010 --> 31:48.436
and now is not
really a good time.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.540
Okay, Well, maybe
I could just ask you.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.542
Okay.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.676
Would it be okay if I
slept here for a while

31:57.683 --> 31:58.993
down in the basement?

31:58.994 --> 32:00.785
I... I could pay rent.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.316
I could do work here again.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.591
Yeah. No, I think that's a...

32:03.592 --> 32:06.057
- That's a wonderful idea.
- Okay.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.026
In fact, there's, um,

32:08.027 --> 32:09.827
the water heater
down in the basement

32:09.828 --> 32:11.228
could use some attention.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.000
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

32:13.001 --> 32:14.265
Thank you.

32:14.266 --> 32:18.066
I'm going to
bottom line it for you.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.470
If you don't testify,

32:19.471 --> 32:21.351
I'm going to arrest you
for accessory to murder.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.409
Take a day.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.210
Pray on it.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.421
My favorite kind of birds.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.424
The kind that can't shit on you.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.778
Why aren't you smiling?

33:02.048 --> 33:03.218
I think you broke it.

33:03.219 --> 33:04.575
Yeah.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.117
I wasn't that rough.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.548
It's been a long time.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.790
Hey.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.259
Yeah.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.727
Did you, you know,

33:16.728 --> 33:18.258
write this groundbreaking,

33:18.264 --> 33:21.399
powerful, in-depth
piece about me...

33:21.400 --> 33:24.170
Like Pulitzer material, right?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.712
- Ahem.
- Yeah?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.909
- Yeah?
- Okay, okay, when?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.710
I like when better.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.712
Okay. When.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.254
But what if publishing it

33:37.255 --> 33:39.317
would destroy my reputation?

33:39.318 --> 33:41.118
Would you go ahead and do it?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.820
Anything for a price.

33:43.822 --> 33:44.822
I'm serious.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.485
I need to know where you stand.

33:48.494 --> 33:49.504
You're going to have to choose

33:49.505 --> 33:52.095
between boosting your career

33:52.098 --> 33:53.628
or having to destroy me,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.466
what would you do?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.537
I mean, we all got
to make hard choices,

33:57.538 --> 34:00.366
like rolling the hard 6, right?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.140
Yeah.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.441
If I discover
something about you

34:04.443 --> 34:07.112
that I knew would destroy you,

34:07.113 --> 34:08.513
I wouldn't use it.

34:09.815 --> 34:10.815
Fuck it.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.493
But you'd never see me again.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.731
Keith. Food.

34:30.768 --> 34:31.768
Keith?

34:51.690 --> 34:55.530
I can't explain it.
I never saw this coming.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.601
So what are you saying, doc?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.472
That, while you have the visions

35:05.473 --> 35:06.640
and heard the voices,

35:06.641 --> 35:08.868
your brain activity
never wavered.

35:12.878 --> 35:16.414
No temporal lobe increase,

35:16.415 --> 35:18.845
no abnormal activity.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.818
- Maybe the machine just...
- No, I checked. It's fine.

35:33.599 --> 35:34.869
Good news.

35:39.205 --> 35:41.205
So you're going to
tell me it's God?

35:41.207 --> 35:45.437
What I'm saying is there is
no scientific explanation

35:45.444 --> 35:47.614
for what is going on
in your brain.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.216
There's got to be
an explanation.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.217
And it's not God.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.319
Maybe.

35:55.921 --> 35:56.987
Maybe not.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.256
Two years ago,

35:58.257 --> 36:00.527
a pair of German
computer scientists

36:00.528 --> 36:04.456
proved Kurt Gödel's theorem
on the existence of God.

36:04.463 --> 36:08.399
So you believe He exists.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.436
They proved the theorem,
not the existence.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.637
I already know He doesn't
exist. All right?

36:13.639 --> 36:15.639
So if you can't
tell me what's wrong with me,

36:15.641 --> 36:18.441
at least tell me you know
how to make it go away.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.519
I could give you drugs

36:24.520 --> 36:27.246
that will turn you
into a zombie.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.263
Or I can lobotomize you.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.428
I'm sorry.

36:36.295 --> 36:39.995
Now, look, this is not
the end of our journey.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.598
Okay? I need a little
time to regroup,

36:43.602 --> 36:45.270
figure out the next step.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.938
The next step is I'm alone...

36:47.939 --> 36:49.409
and in prison.

39:29.034 --> 39:34.004
I'm not going to think
about what You look like

39:34.005 --> 39:36.265
or how You listen...

39:36.274 --> 39:38.042
or where You are,

39:38.043 --> 39:41.953
whether You're
at the end of space or...

39:43.248 --> 39:44.918
on the head of a pin.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.618
I don't give a shit

39:47.619 --> 39:51.489
if You're eternal light or time

39:51.490 --> 39:53.690
in a long gray beard.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.464
I don't give a fuck.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.025
All right?

40:01.032 --> 40:02.772
Thank you, Jesus.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.105
Look at me, please...

40:09.374 --> 40:10.814
in Your way.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.450
Look at me.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.118
Some...

40:21.119 --> 40:22.949
Somebody took my son.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.763
Somebody took my wife.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.394
Somebody...

40:30.395 --> 40:31.825
took my job from me,

40:31.830 --> 40:33.970
and now somebody is about
to take my freedom.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.971
And I want to know if it's You.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.083
I want to know if it's You!

40:51.116 --> 40:52.776
If You're there,

40:52.784 --> 40:56.764
if you have love for
everything and everyone...

40:57.623 --> 40:59.463
then fix me...

41:03.562 --> 41:05.762
or I will fix myself.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.066
Dear God...

41:13.872 --> 41:16.642
let me see my name
on this paper.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.218
No.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.221
No.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.789
Keith, get the fuck out of here.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.431
Please don't do this,
Judge Harris.

42:45.432 --> 42:46.730
Judge.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.639
I'm not a judge.
I'm a defendant.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.465
I'm not a Solomon.

42:51.469 --> 42:54.469
I'm a curse that needs
to be destroyed!

42:54.472 --> 42:56.272
Now get the fuck out of here!

42:56.274 --> 43:00.244
Anyone who is among
the living has hope.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.345
Ecclesiastes.

43:01.346 --> 43:03.146
Ecclesiastes shit.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.278
Genesis to Revelations,
all shit!

43:05.283 --> 43:07.223
And these whom He
has predestined.

43:07.224 --> 43:08.686
He has also called.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.517
And these whom He has called.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.821
He has also justified.

43:11.823 --> 43:13.563
And these whom He has justified.

43:13.564 --> 43:16.188
He has also glorified.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.698
Don't.

43:21.132 --> 43:22.732
Keith!

43:23.935 --> 43:25.935
I'm not going
to let you do this.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.682
You stop moving,
or I will shoot you!

43:29.683 --> 43:31.135
So help me God!

43:31.142 --> 43:32.910
God will help you.

43:32.911 --> 43:35.011
He will if you just let Him.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.383
God is an evil,
sadistic son of a bitch.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.117
He promised to give me PJ back.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.787
I did everything...

43:42.788 --> 43:44.418
I did everything He asked.

43:44.422 --> 43:47.792
I made you do horrible things.
Don't you remember?

43:47.793 --> 43:50.227
He promised me my son.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.358
He laughed at me!

43:52.363 --> 43:55.303
You have a son.
Tessie's pregnant.

43:56.401 --> 43:57.701
It's a boy.

43:58.704 --> 43:59.704
It's your boy.

43:59.705 --> 44:01.365
You have a son.

44:12.718 --> 44:15.418
Gunther. Real motor head.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.089
Deals smack over on K Street.

44:17.090 --> 44:19.388
He gets pinched
for running a red light,

44:19.390 --> 44:20.958
and the cop catches him

44:20.959 --> 44:22.459
stuffing something in his mouth.

44:22.460 --> 44:23.800
Gunther says it's candy.

44:23.801 --> 44:25.725
Red Hots. Yeah, right.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.297
So Gunther,

44:27.298 --> 44:28.567
he's sitting in holding,

44:28.568 --> 44:29.866
waiting for his twink boyfriend

44:29.868 --> 44:31.168
to post bail for him,

44:31.169 --> 44:32.769
and then he's scot-free, right?

44:32.771 --> 44:34.104
Wrong.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.635
Gunther wants a milkshake.

44:37.909 --> 44:40.149
Says the, Red Hots
kind of stuck.

44:40.150 --> 44:41.505
Wow.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.522
"All right, sure, buddy,
whatever you want," right?

44:44.523 --> 44:45.775
So...

44:47.052 --> 44:48.092
We...

44:49.755 --> 44:51.255
we get Gunther a milkshake,

44:51.256 --> 44:54.825
and we dose Gunther's milkshake

44:54.826 --> 44:57.626
with laxatives.

44:57.628 --> 45:00.968
Later, we're watching him
through the one-way glass,

45:00.969 --> 45:03.934
and this guy is in pain.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.935
He is moaning like a cow
about to give birth.

45:06.938 --> 45:09.338
He starts pounding on the door.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.780
"I got to go to the can, man!
I got to go to the can!"

45:14.645 --> 45:16.345
But we can't hear him.

45:16.347 --> 45:17.647
Aww!

45:17.648 --> 45:18.916
So Gunther,

45:18.917 --> 45:21.185
he can't hold it anymore.

45:21.186 --> 45:23.786
Guy's eyes are bugging
out of his head.

45:23.789 --> 45:26.559
Shits out six balloons
of heroin in his pants.

45:29.861 --> 45:32.501
Gunther just had to have
that fucking milkshake.

45:33.631 --> 45:35.900
Talk about pulling
the wrong thread.

45:35.901 --> 45:38.168
- Wilson.
- Shh.

45:38.169 --> 45:39.536
It's not your fault.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.807
You just pulled
the wrong thread.

45:44.175 --> 45:45.605
Excuse me.

45:45.610 --> 45:46.880
Wait. Your purse.

45:48.446 --> 45:49.446
Thank you.

46:01.326 --> 46:02.526
Where's Mrs. Harris?

46:04.329 --> 46:06.299
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

46:11.136 --> 46:13.666
- Wilson.
- Shh.

46:13.671 --> 46:15.071
It's not your fault.

46:15.073 --> 46:16.543
You just pulled on
the wrong thread.

46:29.888 --> 46:31.218
My God.

46:37.495 --> 46:38.955
Hey.

46:39.865 --> 46:41.495
I brought...

46:41.499 --> 46:42.499
I...

46:43.305 --> 46:49.932
