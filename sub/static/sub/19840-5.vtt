WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.375
I know you are not going
to believe what I have to say.

00:02.753 --> 00:05.193
Yeah. Basie Skanks might not be perfect,

00:05.214 --> 00:07.114
at least he's not a false prophet.

00:07.149 --> 00:09.182
<i>Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:09.218 --> 00:13.219
<i>- Mae...
- Don't say anything, please.</i>

00:13.254 --> 00:15.388
I didn't come here
to cause you any trouble.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.793
<i>Does Jabari perform
with all his artists like that?</i>

00:21.829 --> 00:23.191
I think so. Why?

00:23.216 --> 00:24.850
Charity, is there something
going on between you two?

00:24.901 --> 00:27.267
- Kevin, are you crazy?
- It just seems like there is.

00:27.302 --> 00:29.169
I think I found a silver bullet

00:29.204 --> 00:31.805
for that werewolf Basie Skanks.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.418
Aaron's flying in from Nashville.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.618
- Lionel's son?
- Mm-hmm, our prayers have been answered.

00:36.654 --> 00:38.587
Come here, boy.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.455
I worshipped the ground
that man walked on,

00:40.491 --> 00:43.857
and all he ever had to do
was just say, "Good job, son."

00:43.893 --> 00:45.993
Instead what I get... "Gigi
would have done it better.

00:46.028 --> 00:48.762
I wasn't quite feeling
the Word today, Jacob."

00:48.798 --> 00:51.121
- All righty, here we are.
- It's nice.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.558
Do you have to go back
to work after this,

00:52.594 --> 00:54.321
- or can you stay out?
- What'd you have in mind?

00:54.346 --> 00:56.646
<i>Thought you might
wanna blow off some steam.</i>

01:20.289 --> 01:21.355
Morning.

01:24.327 --> 01:27.495
Hey, what are you doing up so early?

01:27.530 --> 01:29.263
Praying.

01:36.118 --> 01:39.252
Oh, brother.

01:39.707 --> 01:42.533
It says "flip the yellow switch."

01:42.561 --> 01:45.022
I just did that, Riss, twice.

01:45.665 --> 01:47.466
Let me see this thing.

01:48.633 --> 01:50.466
I just told you I already did that.

01:50.502 --> 01:52.034
I keep thinking this place
can't get any worse,

01:52.069 --> 01:53.719
and every day, I am proven wrong.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.507
- I'm calling Tasha.
- Don't call Tasha. I'll call Stan.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.776
We can't keep calling
your family's handyman

01:58.811 --> 02:00.811
every time something
goes wrong around here.

02:00.847 --> 02:02.613
Why not? He doesn't mind helping out.

02:02.648 --> 02:04.047
I mind.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.448
You don't think
your mother hears about it

02:05.484 --> 02:06.916
every time he comes over here?

02:06.952 --> 02:08.485
He might not charge us, but believe me,

02:08.520 --> 02:10.108
those courtesy calls
are anything but free.

02:14.726 --> 02:16.592
Pastor Skanks, good morning.

02:16.628 --> 02:18.561
Tell me you didn't know about this.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.397
I didn't know about this.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.165
- Tell him this place needs rewiring.
- Shh, shh.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.506
What don't I know about?

02:24.541 --> 02:26.804
This injunction your father's
filed against your church.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.508
Construction's been halted for 28 days.

02:29.773 --> 02:31.870
No, I didn't know about that.

02:31.895 --> 02:33.628
Didn't know what? What now?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.120
I'll be right over.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.295
No, don't come to Triumph.

02:37.497 --> 02:39.162
All right, well, where you wanna meet?

02:39.425 --> 02:40.555
Cavalry.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.420
- Cavalry Fellowship?
<i>- That's right.</i>

02:43.455 --> 02:45.888
We gonna settle this with
the bishop once and for all.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.512
So, are you gonna tell me or not?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.847
Cavalry filed an injunction

02:54.882 --> 02:56.493
to stop construction at the church.

02:56.724 --> 02:59.124
Basie's on his way over to
Cavalry right now to fight it.

02:59.149 --> 03:01.650
Good. And I'm gonna call Tasha.

03:01.675 --> 03:03.942
- Please don't bother her.
- If they thought this place

03:03.967 --> 03:05.867
was livable, they'd be living here.

03:05.892 --> 03:08.880
Life is a fight. Fight!

03:54.276 --> 03:58.078
Now, this balcony is the perfect place

03:58.113 --> 04:02.548
to unwind with a Bible
or take a leisurely breakfast.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.049
It's beautiful.

04:04.085 --> 04:06.419
Yeah, well, the view
isn't as picturesque

04:06.454 --> 04:08.926
as the one from the balcony of
your family's place in Captiva,

04:08.957 --> 04:12.625
I know, but it has
its countrified charm.

04:12.660 --> 04:13.893
I'll be out here every morning.

04:13.928 --> 04:16.361
Well, I hope that's true.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.733
Sometimes, I confess,

04:19.769 --> 04:21.834
I feel like I'm the only person here

04:21.870 --> 04:25.305
who still really appreciates
the beauty of this place.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.708
How Jacob was able to leave it behind

04:27.743 --> 04:30.754
as a thing of no value is beyond me.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.412
We'll get him back soon enough.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.548
Oh, I pray you're right.

04:36.583 --> 04:39.218
But in the meantime,
protecting this house

04:39.253 --> 04:42.191
is our first priority,
because if Calvary fails,

04:42.199 --> 04:44.465
we'll probably have to sell
this place to settle the books.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.234
I won't let that happen.

04:48.837 --> 04:52.472
Should I have Maricel bring
up some coffee and a newspaper?

04:52.508 --> 04:55.324
Because I know your father
loves his crossword puzzles.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.404
No, no, that's okay, Mrs. Greenleaf.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.540
I actually better get going.
First day on the job.

04:59.575 --> 05:01.374
I should get a jump on things.

05:01.410 --> 05:04.477
Well, all right, but first,
I want to show you the pool

05:04.512 --> 05:07.980
because, as I recall,
you are an avid swimmer.

05:09.551 --> 05:12.652
- Good morning, Kevie.
- Good morning, Ma.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.554
- All right.
- Beautiful as always.

05:14.589 --> 05:15.988
- Thank you.
- Hey.

05:16.023 --> 05:18.485
Okay. Thank you.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.369
Hey, so what'd they say?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.439
Oh, just, you know, it's probably viral,

05:24.474 --> 05:26.441
so antibiotics won't help.

05:26.476 --> 05:29.477
Even if they're right, I just
hate how judgy they are.

05:29.512 --> 05:32.486
Like me wanting my son to feel
better is a failing on me.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.998
I'm sure that's not what they meant.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.300
Kevin, are you busy this morning?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.668
I have a few appointments. Why?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.336
I'm supposed to meet Jabari

05:38.371 --> 05:40.070
to look at options for cover art.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.374
And then he's leaving,
so it's our last day.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.676
I can move some things around.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.546
Yeah, and I'll take him this afternoon.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.415
Yeah, yeah, but take your time.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.609
I wanna hang with him as much as I can

05:53.645 --> 05:55.714
before... you know.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.147
Who knows?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.350
You'll be able to see him
whenever you want.

06:00.385 --> 06:02.389
You know that. Divorce
isn't gonna change that.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.804
I know.

06:03.839 --> 06:06.439
Just we need to actually talk soon

06:06.475 --> 06:08.178
so we can figure out how this
all is gonna work out.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.267
I know, and we will tonight.

06:11.303 --> 06:12.602
I promise.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.504
You gonna go with Daddy?

06:14.539 --> 06:17.173
- Oh, let's go with Daddy.
- I got you, man.

06:17.209 --> 06:20.310
Oh, there you go.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.972
Thank you.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.207
Yeah.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.976
It's okay.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.274
This is your first wedding
since you came back, isn't it?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.777
Yeah, your granddad needed a break.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.412
Think you'll ever get married?

06:38.448 --> 06:40.848
It's not on my to-do list.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.399
Darius?

06:43.434 --> 06:44.968
Is just a friend.

06:45.003 --> 06:47.804
- With benefits.
- Excuse me?

06:47.839 --> 06:50.606
I'm not the one sneaking in
at 5:00 in the morning.

06:50.642 --> 06:53.442
Oh, no, no. I was trying
not to wake you up.

06:53.478 --> 06:54.811
And we're not sleeping together,

06:54.846 --> 06:56.546
not that that's any of your business.

06:56.581 --> 06:57.981
So, what do you two do all night?

06:58.016 --> 06:59.300
Well, we talk, mostly.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.669
Yeah, about what?

07:00.714 --> 07:02.614
Honestly?

07:02.649 --> 07:03.990
Yeah.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.707
How to put Mac away for good.

07:07.944 --> 07:09.371
Ever think...

07:10.639 --> 07:12.605
"Maybe I should just pray for him

07:12.641 --> 07:14.885
and give it to God?"

07:14.893 --> 07:16.592
No.

07:16.627 --> 07:19.328
And if I ever did,
I'd take one look at you

07:19.363 --> 07:21.063
and get right back on that horse.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.152
This isn't about punishment, baby.

07:25.169 --> 07:28.270
As long as he's free,
he's a danger to girls like you.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.860
And I can't have that.

07:31.956 --> 07:33.488
I'd better get going.

07:33.976 --> 07:35.522
Okay.

07:35.812 --> 07:37.444
Say "hey" to Pastor Ramona for me.

07:37.469 --> 07:39.703
Mm-hmm.

07:39.728 --> 07:42.087
- God is good.
- All the time.

07:42.506 --> 07:44.739
The Hicksons are in your office.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.960
I thought they were supposed
to meet me down here.

07:46.985 --> 07:48.651
- Wasn't that the plan?
- Well, I think there's an issue.

07:49.209 --> 07:51.009
An issue.

07:51.044 --> 07:52.107
The day before the wedding.

07:52.132 --> 07:53.897
That is when the issues come up.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.000
- Why is Sophia here today?
- New Believers Workshop.

07:57.035 --> 08:00.470
Oh, yeah, I saw she got
baptized during the revival.

08:00.506 --> 08:02.439
- Mm-hmm.
- You must be so proud.

08:02.474 --> 08:05.207
I'm definitely interested to see
what she's gonna do with it.

08:05.243 --> 08:08.010
Well, if she's anything like Vida
was when she got baptized,

08:08.045 --> 08:10.334
get ready for a season of righteousness.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.231
- It's already started.
- Wow.

08:12.267 --> 08:14.233
Oh, by the way, did you ask Vida?

08:14.269 --> 08:16.002
I did. I'm sorry.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.371
She just doesn't want to deal
with the police again.

08:18.406 --> 08:19.839
She wants to move on.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.091
Okay.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.628
- Thank you for trying.
- I'm sorry.

08:25.663 --> 08:27.196
You know, a phone call, you can ignore.

08:27.231 --> 08:28.792
A human being, you got to deal with.

08:28.828 --> 08:30.764
I'm just thinking barging
in like this without warning...

08:30.765 --> 08:32.827
The element of surprise
is working in your favor.

08:32.863 --> 08:35.263
You're much more likely
to get an undefended response.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.812
Anyhow, fortune favors the bold.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.251
Charge!

08:38.808 --> 08:40.708
Pastor Greenleaf.

08:40.744 --> 08:42.577
- Pastor Skanks.
- Mm-hmm.

08:44.347 --> 08:47.515
This is how the Bible says
to handle disputes anyways,

08:47.540 --> 08:49.674
Christian to Christian,
not rifling through

08:49.699 --> 08:51.532
Caesar's playbook for his poisons.

08:51.557 --> 08:53.623
I mean, seriously. Lawyers?

08:53.648 --> 08:55.413
Excuse me. Jacob, you...

08:55.438 --> 08:57.337
...just wouldn't get done.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.143
All the time.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.663
Bye now.

09:02.134 --> 09:04.868
- Jacob.
- I'm sorry, they walked right in.

09:04.904 --> 09:07.168
Well, they can just walk right on out.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.473
Unless they're here to surrender.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.106
Quite the opposite.

09:11.142 --> 09:13.242
Go on, speak your piece.

09:16.414 --> 09:17.547
Sorry, Pop, I, uh...

09:17.582 --> 09:19.849
Sorry? You have got to be kidding me.

09:19.884 --> 09:22.060
Give me that thing.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.661
What kind of a father
does this to his only son

09:24.696 --> 09:27.897
without salvation for all humanity
hanging in the balance?

09:27.933 --> 09:29.467
Did you break his toys
when he was a baby?

09:29.492 --> 09:30.973
'Cause something tells me you did.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.422
Jacob, take this creature outside.

09:33.457 --> 09:36.925
No, he's not going
anywhere, and neither am I, sir.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.160
Not until this matter is peacefully

09:39.195 --> 09:40.675
and spiritually resolved.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.138
Then post up

09:43.874 --> 09:46.074
because it's gonna take...

09:46.109 --> 09:48.277
28 days.

09:48.312 --> 09:50.179
At least.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.447
The most important
thing is that I love you.

09:52.483 --> 09:55.217
That is not
the most important thing, Preston.

09:55.252 --> 09:58.368
The most important thing
is whether you love God.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.654
- Corinthians II says...
- All right, hold on.

10:00.690 --> 10:02.623
Before we start waving around
our loaded Bibles...

10:02.658 --> 10:05.393
- I was simply...
- Can I just ask, how did this come up?

10:05.428 --> 10:07.065
- We were...
- We were...

10:08.377 --> 10:11.144
We were talking about schools last night

10:11.169 --> 10:13.303
- and where we should send our kids.
- Are you pregnant?

10:13.328 --> 10:15.523
- No!
- That's what I said.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.031
Why are we even talking about this?

10:17.067 --> 10:18.599
It's so early.

10:18.635 --> 10:21.535
Some of those waiting lists
are four years out,

10:21.571 --> 10:23.604
- sometimes five years out.
- She's not wrong about that.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.606
- Five years?
- And then he said he doesn't think

10:25.642 --> 10:27.685
that they should have
a Christian education.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.010
I just think that it
would be easier for them to make

10:30.046 --> 10:32.658
an informed decision if they
started in a secular school.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.608
What do they need to be informed
about besides the cross?

10:35.643 --> 10:38.844
Huh? Evolution? Oh, gay rights.
Oh! Abortion.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.561
- So you want...
- If I could just interrupt for a second.

10:41.586 --> 10:43.653
I don't want to be unequally yoked.

10:43.678 --> 10:45.912
Yes, I'm familiar
with that verse, but...

10:48.496 --> 10:49.924
Gosh.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.092
Something tells me
this is a bigger conversation

10:53.127 --> 10:55.784
than we can fruitfully have
in the six minutes we have left

10:55.785 --> 10:59.815
before this wedding rehearsal, so can...
can we just put a pin in this right now?

10:59.851 --> 11:01.644
We'll come back to it after.

11:02.553 --> 11:03.853
Yeah.

11:03.888 --> 11:05.398
Simone?

11:06.190 --> 11:07.789
Fine.

11:07.824 --> 11:09.496
I can see you love each other.

11:09.521 --> 11:11.054
This is gonna be all right.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.219
What do you think of that one?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.929
That's kind of gloomy
for a gospel record.

11:16.930 --> 11:19.258
It's not gloomy. It's soulful.

11:19.294 --> 11:22.028
It shows you're, like, for real.

11:22.063 --> 11:24.096
Well, you know best.

11:24.132 --> 11:26.698
Then we'll go with that one.

11:26.734 --> 11:29.402
And don't worry, you'll have a
chance to say no one last time

11:29.437 --> 11:30.860
- when we get the proofs back.
- No, no.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.509
This is it.

11:32.859 --> 11:33.958
I trust you.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.794
And I appreciate that. Immensely.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.165
You know, I know you did this record

11:41.200 --> 11:42.813
as a one-time thing for the church.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.861
You should be doing this
professionally full-time.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.530
Calvary pays me pretty well.

11:47.565 --> 11:49.667
No, no, no, I mean writing.

11:50.235 --> 11:52.834
I know people in Nashville
that make a million a year

11:52.869 --> 11:55.137
that can't write a song
like you by a long shot.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.437
I don't do it for money.

11:56.473 --> 11:58.873
I know, and that's why you're good.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.745
I got a publishing company.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.713
We can start out slow
with a deal to write songs,

12:03.749 --> 12:05.124
see where it leads.

12:06.284 --> 12:09.076
- Would I have to come to Nashville?
- Just a couple days a month.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.472
I'd line you up with other
songwriters, boom, boom, boom.

12:12.684 --> 12:14.901
It'd be fun, if nothing else.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.934
Let me pray about it.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.726
That's the right answer.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.999
Uh, well...

12:25.176 --> 12:26.641
see you at the release party.

12:26.666 --> 12:29.801
See you at the release party.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.617
You'll never know
how much this meant to me.

12:40.494 --> 12:43.121
You made me believe in myself again,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.362
my value.

12:46.318 --> 12:47.851
Thank you.

12:47.876 --> 12:49.309
It was my pleasure.

12:59.171 --> 13:00.338
Oh.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.174
Hey, Mom.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.102
Well, I hope I wasn't
interrupting anything.

13:08.137 --> 13:10.690
No, we were just saying goodbye.

13:11.107 --> 13:12.607
Is that a new jacket?

13:12.642 --> 13:14.907
No, I've had this for years.

13:14.943 --> 13:17.516
I'll, uh, put the final mixes

13:17.541 --> 13:19.541
in your Dropbox
and send you the layouts.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.533
Thank you.

13:21.616 --> 13:22.716
Ma'am.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.236
- Should I be concerned?
- About what?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.238
Well, that was quite an embrace.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.682
He's done a lot for me. I'm grateful.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.758
Grateful.

13:38.793 --> 13:40.361
Yes, grateful, Mama.

13:40.396 --> 13:42.680
Just grateful.

13:43.265 --> 13:45.131
Well, be careful.

13:45.167 --> 13:47.027
Take it from a woman who knows.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.436
Mama...

13:49.504 --> 13:53.272
I should probably tell you so
you don't get the wrong idea.

13:55.276 --> 13:56.443
What is it, dear?

14:00.129 --> 14:02.129
Kevin and I are breaking up.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.207
I'm sorry.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.595
You know we've been having problems.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.097
Yes, I know.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.565
But marriage?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.628
Marriage you can bend.

14:14.711 --> 14:17.344
You can bend it
until it's all knotted up

14:17.369 --> 14:20.210
like some seaweed from the swamp.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.168
But you break it...

14:22.458 --> 14:24.291
break it...

14:25.454 --> 14:27.054
and that's a loss.

14:29.018 --> 14:31.118
I don't think we can stay married, Mama.

14:31.143 --> 14:33.033
Well, I'm not saying you should,

14:33.039 --> 14:35.973
but I highly recommend
that you and Kevin

14:36.328 --> 14:39.018
just sit down with your father and me,

14:39.045 --> 14:43.147
and talk about it before
you make a final decision.

14:46.998 --> 14:48.413
Okay.

14:48.832 --> 14:52.087
You never want sadness like
this for your children,

14:52.141 --> 14:53.673
but it comes.

14:55.663 --> 14:57.396
Come here, baby.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.948
Hello, you've reached Aaron Jeffries,

15:24.984 --> 15:28.721
acting general counsel
for Cavalry Fellowship World...

15:29.422 --> 15:31.919
<i>If you are satisfied</i>
with your greeting, press...

15:31.954 --> 15:34.053
Basie Skanks just marched into my office

15:34.088 --> 15:37.516
like some angry baseball manager
hot out of the dugout

15:37.520 --> 15:38.942
in the bottom of the ninth
in game seven.

15:38.943 --> 15:40.104
What does he want?

15:40.139 --> 15:42.105
He says he wants to resolve this,

15:42.140 --> 15:45.074
but we know and he knows
there can be no resolution

15:45.110 --> 15:46.876
as long as this stunt is being pulled.

15:46.911 --> 15:48.211
So, then what is he doing here?

15:48.247 --> 15:49.912
I guess he's trying to put on

15:49.948 --> 15:52.249
some kind of shadow
puppet show for Jacob,

15:52.284 --> 15:53.983
doing whatever he can to draw that boy

15:54.018 --> 15:55.719
even further from me and this family.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.454
So, what do you want to do?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.217
You tell me.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.852
Do we call the police?

16:01.887 --> 16:03.754
No, no, you don't want that attention.

16:03.789 --> 16:05.388
Well, I'm not about to dignify

16:05.423 --> 16:07.423
this home invasion with a sit-down.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.203
- Can you wait him out?
- Hmm?

16:10.228 --> 16:13.363
My father says there's one thing
the devil can't brook,

16:13.519 --> 16:15.418
and it's being ignored.

16:17.742 --> 16:19.708
Hmm.

16:24.656 --> 16:27.623
Hmm.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.574
Hello, you've reached
Aaron Jeffries, acting...

16:35.379 --> 16:36.678
<i>If you are satisfied</i> with your
greeting...

16:36.713 --> 16:38.546
What is the Wi-Fi password?

16:38.582 --> 16:40.382
I can't find a signal to save my life.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.649
Look, let's just go back to Triumph.

16:41.685 --> 16:43.085
I'm sure there's a way around this.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.953
I don't wanna go around it.
I wanna go through it.

16:44.989 --> 16:47.588
- Behind you.
- Basie, this isn't gonna work.

16:47.623 --> 16:48.856
So what?

16:48.891 --> 16:50.757
This church, that church,
this injunction...

16:50.793 --> 16:52.493
that's not what this is about.

16:52.528 --> 16:54.628
This is about manhood, brother.

16:54.663 --> 16:56.797
It's about fighting to take hold of that

16:56.832 --> 16:58.536
for which Christ Jesus took hold of you.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.326
- Are you a pastor or not?
- I'm trying to be, yeah.

17:01.362 --> 17:04.060
Then fight for your church.

17:09.101 --> 17:11.135
What's the Wi-Fi password?

17:11.170 --> 17:14.137
I'm gonna have to
excuse myself this afternoon

17:14.173 --> 17:16.773
to attend a meeting with the deacons,

17:16.809 --> 17:20.065
so whatever effect you two think
this little sit-in is having

17:20.122 --> 17:22.756
after 4:00 PM will be wasted.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.892
Uh, that's a little FYI.

17:25.928 --> 17:28.362
May I speak to you privately?

17:28.396 --> 17:30.831
Of course, dear. What is it?

17:30.866 --> 17:32.899
Hey, mama. We were just...

17:32.935 --> 17:35.001
I know, Karine explained.

17:35.037 --> 17:37.236
So how's that hot water problem?

17:37.271 --> 17:38.647
Stan mentioned that it might require...

17:38.682 --> 17:41.374
Yeah, we fixed it. Thanks.

17:41.409 --> 17:42.975
Come on.

17:46.241 --> 17:48.208
What foolishness.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.951
What hot water problem?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.096
Nothing.

17:53.254 --> 17:54.821
It's nothing.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.685
What is your plan here, James?

17:59.720 --> 18:01.554
We have the deacon board coming later.

18:01.589 --> 18:04.423
We finally have a chance to
give them some good news

18:04.459 --> 18:06.058
after all of that drought,

18:06.094 --> 18:08.125
and I don't want those two
jokers here skulking.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.096
I know, I know. I'll see
what Aaron has to say.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.931
Now, we may have to negotiate.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.966
Whatever. I want them out.

18:15.002 --> 18:16.267
Can you imagine the hay

18:16.302 --> 18:18.202
that Fred Williams could make over this?

18:18.238 --> 18:21.106
Okay, I'll see that they're gone, dear.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.008
Now, what did you need me for?

18:23.043 --> 18:25.943
Come.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.403
Charity just told me that
she and Kevin are divorcing.

18:34.438 --> 18:35.804
I thought things were going well.

18:35.839 --> 18:37.683
Apparently not.

18:38.209 --> 18:39.923
What is the problem with those two?

18:39.958 --> 18:41.646
She wouldn't say.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.471
But I'm fairly sure
that it has something to do

18:44.507 --> 18:45.973
with that music man.

18:46.009 --> 18:47.441
Whatever it is,

18:47.476 --> 18:50.311
this family cannot take
another scandal right now.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.946
And whatever happens,
I want to make sure

18:52.965 --> 18:55.032
that we are fully protected.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.669
From what? Kevin?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.836
From whatever drama those two cook up.

18:59.871 --> 19:03.292
I mean, listen, you know
how messy those things can be.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.844
And, yes, if it comes to it, Kevin.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.399
All right, I'll...

19:10.856 --> 19:13.089
I'll check into it, okay?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.339
Hey, little man.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.341
I will never leave you.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.022
Then I'll do my spiel. So

19:44.266 --> 19:46.233
- And then you'll do your vows.
- Great.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.135
And since you chose to write your own,

19:48.170 --> 19:50.548
I'll say, "And now the couple
has written their own vows,

19:50.564 --> 19:52.383
which they will now share."

19:52.900 --> 19:54.927
Preston, you wanna go first?

19:56.269 --> 19:57.702
You want me to say the vows now?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.538
Yeah, unless you want to surprise her.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.240
Oh, no, let's make sure
that she's on board

20:02.275 --> 20:03.522
with everything that I'm gonna say.

20:03.547 --> 20:05.146
That sounds smart.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.959
It's not like I'm hard to please.

20:07.212 --> 20:09.275
Oh, no one said you were.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.700
You know what?
Why don't we just do the vows?

20:11.725 --> 20:13.692
And we can talk about the rest later.

20:13.717 --> 20:14.957
- All right?
- Yeah.

20:14.982 --> 20:16.915
- We're good. Okay.
- Okay.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.506
Go ahead. Go ahead.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.002
Simone...

20:28.277 --> 20:31.278
today I am glad
because I believe that God

20:31.313 --> 20:33.213
has ordained our love.

20:33.248 --> 20:35.782
I promise to love you
as Christ loved the church...

20:35.817 --> 20:37.884
I'm sorry, I can't. Just stop.

20:37.919 --> 20:39.818
Please, let's just get through this.

20:39.853 --> 20:41.620
- Do you believe what you're saying?
- Of course.

20:41.656 --> 20:43.422
But you don't, though. I can tell.

20:43.457 --> 20:45.724
Oh, maybe I can't...
I don't even know...

20:45.759 --> 20:47.250
- Simone, I think that you have...
- No. No. No.

20:47.285 --> 20:49.483
- Simone.
- I cannot do this.

20:49.518 --> 20:51.830
- Simone. Simone.
- I'm sorry.

20:51.865 --> 20:53.666
I'm s... I'm sorry.

20:53.701 --> 20:56.033
Simone, honey...

21:01.260 --> 21:03.127
Hey, K.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.196
I thought you were the electrician.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.131
Well, if you really need
one, we'll call one.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.534
But what's the issue now, princess?

21:10.570 --> 21:12.875
Well, the kitchen outlets.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.429
Well, have you tried
resetting the breaker?

21:14.465 --> 21:16.799
Yeah, yeah, but now
that whole wall is dead.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.400
Have you been running the heater again?

21:18.435 --> 21:20.102
I know you like it all cozy up in here.

21:20.138 --> 21:22.471
I have not been running the heater,

21:22.506 --> 21:25.908
but we should be able to have warm air
and a refrigerator at the same time.

21:25.943 --> 21:27.449
Okay, well, listen to you,

21:27.453 --> 21:30.020
sounding like the Israelites
in the desert whining to Moses.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.556
You wanna go back to Egypt, too?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.593
No, I just want a house that works.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.528
Okay.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.892
So serious.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.457
All right, let's see what we can do.

21:41.492 --> 21:44.025
Let's do... this should work.

21:46.797 --> 21:49.464
Okay, well, let me try one more thing.

21:49.499 --> 21:51.432
- Basie.
- Yeah?

21:51.468 --> 21:52.944
Let's go, man. Come on.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.577
No.

21:54.613 --> 21:56.012
Well...

21:56.047 --> 21:58.715
Wait, here. Check this out.

22:02.119 --> 22:03.619
Is that... who's that?

22:03.654 --> 22:06.822
That's my daddy, Darryl James.

22:08.986 --> 22:10.185
Handsome man.

22:11.896 --> 22:13.296
You played baseball, right?

22:13.451 --> 22:15.410
Yeah, almost went pro.
Should have, considering.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.900
Hush that noise. What position?

22:16.925 --> 22:18.359
First base. You?

22:18.384 --> 22:19.864
Shortstop.

22:21.215 --> 22:24.216
Baseball was the only thing
my daddy and I had in common.

22:24.252 --> 22:26.719
The year he died, PONY league
had just come around

22:26.754 --> 22:28.654
and he signed me up.

22:28.689 --> 22:31.323
I remember I came home.
I found a box on the bed.

22:31.359 --> 22:33.795
Inside of it was a brand-new uniform.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.812
The DeLancey Orioles, #24.

22:36.847 --> 22:39.715
I was so excited, I fell asleep
that night wearing it.

22:42.452 --> 22:45.514
In the morning, my mama woke me up.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.976
I knew something was wrong
'cause she brought me hot cocoa.

22:49.611 --> 22:52.412
I knew you only get hot cocoa
on special occasions.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.191
She... she sat me up,

22:55.765 --> 22:58.233
looked me in my eyes, gave me the mug,

22:58.258 --> 22:59.862
and said, "Basie...

23:00.370 --> 23:01.947
your daddy's gone.

23:03.399 --> 23:05.433
He got caught in a fire
last night at the church,

23:05.458 --> 23:07.057
and he didn't make it out."

23:14.101 --> 23:16.068
I know you think I'm crazy.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.171
And I won't deny it.
I got a streak of it.

23:19.207 --> 23:22.307
But that night,
something broke in my life,

23:22.342 --> 23:25.710
in my mama's life, in Bishop's
life, and maybe yours.

23:25.745 --> 23:29.725
And all I'm trying to do is put it
back together the way God told me.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.708
So God told you to drag my daddy down?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.103
No.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.946
He told me to lift you up.

23:37.691 --> 23:39.281
Would you gentlemen be so kind

23:39.316 --> 23:41.384
as to meet me in the conference room?

23:46.691 --> 23:47.823
See?

23:49.614 --> 23:51.413
The table's set.

23:52.203 --> 23:56.104
The only question now is
what are you serving?

24:03.181 --> 24:06.238
Bottom line, what I really
want to leave y'all with...

24:06.278 --> 24:10.378
and this should be a source
of comfort... is this.

24:10.414 --> 24:12.580
You can't take yo baptism back.

24:12.616 --> 24:14.862
The day you dipped yourself
in that water,

24:14.870 --> 24:17.904
you crossed a spiritual threshold.

24:17.939 --> 24:20.373
You might fall away. You might stray.

24:20.408 --> 24:23.461
I know people who've been
baptized 10 times.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.127
You might be one of those folks,

24:25.162 --> 24:28.576
always needing to get
their batteries recharged.

24:29.159 --> 24:33.594
What you'll never be again
is someone who wasn't baptized.

24:33.844 --> 24:36.278
You've passed the point of no return.

24:36.303 --> 24:39.304
Cherish that. Count on it.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.213
There's no going back.

24:44.132 --> 24:46.519
Praise the Lord,
you've reached Aaron Jeffries,

24:46.527 --> 24:48.594
- acting...
- General counsel?

24:48.629 --> 24:50.596
<i>If you are satisfied
with your greeting, press...</i>

24:50.631 --> 24:52.531
- How can I help?
- Could you meet me

24:52.567 --> 24:53.908
and Jacob and Basie
in the conference room?

24:53.951 --> 24:55.242
Of course. What's the strategy?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.669
Whatever it takes
to get them out the door.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.872
Is there any way possible

25:01.907 --> 25:03.341
that's there's some other reason

25:03.376 --> 25:04.641
why you're scared to get married

25:04.677 --> 25:06.743
and this drama is just an excuse?

25:06.779 --> 25:07.845
Drama?!

25:07.880 --> 25:09.981
Well, this issue with Preston.

25:12.531 --> 25:14.164
Can I be straight with you?

25:14.354 --> 25:15.785
Please.

25:15.820 --> 25:18.703
We wanted the bishop to do this wedding.

25:18.903 --> 25:21.037
He married my sister and her husband,

25:21.062 --> 25:23.662
and people still talk about that sermon.

25:23.687 --> 25:25.554
They're still quoting it on Facebook.

25:25.579 --> 25:26.878
He has a way with words.

25:26.903 --> 25:28.803
And a lot of other things, too.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.228
When we found out that
the bishop was unavailable

25:31.253 --> 25:33.520
and we would be getting you
instead, I lived with it,

25:33.545 --> 25:35.812
but you never would have been
my first choice, ever.

25:38.123 --> 25:39.309
Okay.

25:39.334 --> 25:43.403
Because I heard that you were a
preacher, and you just quit.

25:43.428 --> 25:47.530
And I'll never understand how a
real Christian could do that.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.652
I could walk you through it.

25:51.677 --> 25:52.753
Don't.

25:53.684 --> 25:55.083
I'm...

25:55.118 --> 25:57.973
I'm pretty sure
that whatever your reasons are

25:58.697 --> 26:00.730
won't hold up to much scrutiny.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.657
I'm sorry.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.993
Simone, baby, come on.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.129
I can't, Preston.

26:14.164 --> 26:17.265
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:17.301 --> 26:19.067
It's not your fault.

26:30.786 --> 26:34.721
All right, I'll talk to Basie
about getting DeMarco over here

26:34.746 --> 26:38.913
to rewire the house, although,
I honestly don't think

26:38.938 --> 26:41.542
that this is the right time
to be spending on luxuries.

26:42.124 --> 26:43.991
How is having two working outlets

26:44.016 --> 26:46.083
in a kitchen a luxury, Tasha?

26:46.108 --> 26:47.641
Well, it's... it's not.

26:47.666 --> 26:49.566
It's just the situation
Basie and I are in...

26:49.591 --> 26:51.058
What situation?

26:51.083 --> 26:53.383
I know about that high-rise
you guys live in.

26:53.408 --> 26:55.980
- Do all of your outlets work?
- They do.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.672
And, look, I don't need
you to yell at me.

26:58.697 --> 27:00.530
I'm just trying to explain that...

27:00.555 --> 27:02.922
No, this is not me yelling, Tasha.

27:02.947 --> 27:05.522
This is me being clear!

27:06.674 --> 27:08.707
I know you get some strange pleasure

27:08.732 --> 27:11.568
out of treating me like I
think that I am all that,

27:11.593 --> 27:16.226
but I have never suggested
that I think that I am all that!

27:16.251 --> 27:18.687
- I never...
- And I moved my children into this house!

27:18.712 --> 27:21.583
And all I am asking for on their behalf

27:21.608 --> 27:23.742
is a hot stove, safe food,

27:23.767 --> 27:26.735
and to not have blue fire
leaping out at me from the walls

27:26.760 --> 27:29.260
every time I go to plug something in!

27:29.285 --> 27:31.063
- I'm sorry.
- Does that make me a princess?!

27:31.088 --> 27:33.088
I said I'm sorry, Kerissa!

27:35.903 --> 27:39.671
I... I just don't know...

27:39.783 --> 27:41.916
I don't know where
we're gonna get the money.

27:42.686 --> 27:44.284
I don't...

27:44.319 --> 27:46.023
I don't know. It's...

27:46.788 --> 27:48.821
it's not... it's a mess!

27:48.846 --> 27:51.013
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

27:51.038 --> 27:52.804
All right. Okay, come on.

27:52.829 --> 27:55.530
Just come over here
and sit down, sit down.

27:55.555 --> 27:56.754
Sit down.

27:56.779 --> 27:59.247
- I'll get you some tea.
- Yes.

28:02.217 --> 28:04.184
I don't know what to do.

28:05.660 --> 28:07.860
Considering I've been
paying Stan's invoices

28:07.885 --> 28:10.284
for all the work he's
been doing at your house,

28:10.598 --> 28:12.431
whatever you can do to bring this

28:12.456 --> 28:15.177
to a hasty conclusion
would be appreciated.

28:15.991 --> 28:18.320
- You could lift this injunction.
- That's not gonna happen.

28:18.345 --> 28:20.140
Well, here we are.

28:20.868 --> 28:24.237
- Where's your little guru?
- He'll be here.

28:24.312 --> 28:27.647
Sorry about that. Potty break.

28:27.742 --> 28:28.817
TMI.

28:28.842 --> 28:31.067
As ministers of the gospel,
I think we should be able

28:31.092 --> 28:32.626
to settle this without
a lawyer, don't you?

28:32.651 --> 28:34.171
Brother, would you mind?

28:34.196 --> 28:36.463
- Here's what we're willing to offer.
- Guess not.

28:36.488 --> 28:39.356
If you leave the premises upon
the conclusion of this meeting,

28:39.381 --> 28:42.182
within seven days we'll agree
to enter binding arbitration.

28:42.207 --> 28:44.810
And if, in the judgment
of a court-appointed arbiter,

28:44.841 --> 28:48.006
the environmental concerns upon
which the injunction is based

28:48.031 --> 28:50.430
have been addressed or deemed
to be somehow frivolous,

28:50.455 --> 28:52.956
- we'll withdraw.
- So what you're wiling to offer

28:52.981 --> 28:55.035
- is a whole lot of doodly squat.
- It beats 28 days.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.860
The studies that would
have to be completed

28:56.885 --> 28:58.774
to satisfy that sophistry
you just dropped

28:58.799 --> 29:01.087
would take 28 days or more,
and you know it.

29:01.112 --> 29:02.627
How does it feel now, Pastor?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.225
Can I say something?

29:06.261 --> 29:09.429
It's his permission you need
to ask for, Jacob, not mine.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.865
This man's father is dead.

29:11.901 --> 29:13.944
- Don't make this about me.
- Pastor Skanks, please.

29:15.037 --> 29:18.038
When I found out that you,
supposedly a man of God,

29:18.074 --> 29:20.240
gave the order to burn
your own church...

29:20.275 --> 29:23.710
- I did no such thing.
- When I found that out,

29:23.745 --> 29:26.081
the you I thought I knew died, too.

29:26.655 --> 29:29.889
See, Pastor Skanks here
and I have that in common.

29:30.117 --> 29:32.379
We both lost our fathers that night.

29:33.181 --> 29:35.681
It just took me a little longer
to find out than him.

29:41.089 --> 29:42.255
And, Aaron?

29:42.937 --> 29:44.198
I know they drew you into this,

29:44.223 --> 29:46.685
and I still consider you
a friend, but I warn you,

29:47.216 --> 29:50.350
to get in the way of a church
that the Lord wants to build

29:50.375 --> 29:52.042
is a bad place to stand.

29:52.067 --> 29:53.365
Take care you don't say
something to us...

29:53.390 --> 29:56.791
Mama, I love you, but keep your peace.

29:56.816 --> 29:59.185
Because all these years
you've been taking my side

29:59.210 --> 30:01.382
with one hand in his pocket,
you're gonna pay for it.

30:01.407 --> 30:02.682
- You mind how you talk to your mother.
- Heavily.

30:02.707 --> 30:05.178
- James.
- Not as some sort of punishment.

30:06.127 --> 30:09.258
'Cause as... as we all know,

30:09.283 --> 30:11.416
God doesn't hate His children.

30:11.959 --> 30:15.514
But when you see what I can do
without any help from you,

30:15.722 --> 30:18.322
you're gonna mourn the pride
you could have felt in me

30:18.637 --> 30:20.338
when all you had was pity

30:20.363 --> 30:23.397
and some agitation for grace.

30:24.297 --> 30:26.064
And now I pity you.

30:27.481 --> 30:30.181
'Cause you can't raise me any higher.

30:30.206 --> 30:31.738
But I can still grow up.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.106
Looks like we're leaving.

30:45.531 --> 30:47.999
I can't say I'm disappointed.

30:48.024 --> 30:51.025
There's something antique
about this place.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.626
Airless.

30:53.631 --> 30:55.398
Like a tomb.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.502
I mean it and I don't use this word
lightly

31:06.531 --> 31:08.531
that was a miracle, a flat-out miracle.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.979
Check your shoes, my guess is

31:10.004 --> 31:11.453
they're two sizes bigger
than when you woke up.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.411
- Basie...
- Seriously, check 'em!

31:15.452 --> 31:17.452
Look, you don't have to apologize.

31:17.477 --> 31:19.682
I appreciate everything
you've done to lift me up,

31:19.707 --> 31:21.608
but we both know
this is not just about me.

31:21.633 --> 31:23.032
- It's not.
- All right, fair enough.

31:23.299 --> 31:24.766
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

31:24.791 --> 31:26.157
You should have seen this man.

31:26.182 --> 31:27.991
- The way he...
- Can you give us a minute?

31:28.758 --> 31:31.196
Oh, sure.

31:31.221 --> 31:33.220
See you tomorrow.

31:33.245 --> 31:34.512
Pastor.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.366
Why are you doing this?

31:38.849 --> 31:40.781
You know why. Can't preach here.

31:40.806 --> 31:42.968
So you're gonna preach across
the street from Daddy's church?

31:42.993 --> 31:45.352
Jacob, it's just...

31:45.377 --> 31:46.876
It's just what?

31:47.031 --> 31:48.896
It's just so childish.

31:49.072 --> 31:50.638
- Childish?
- Yeah.

31:51.340 --> 31:52.705
Okay.

31:55.205 --> 31:58.672
Grace, you left. Ran away.

31:59.301 --> 32:02.058
You knew what Uncle Mac was
doing to Faith, and you left.

32:02.083 --> 32:03.482
So who are you to say
anything to anybody?

32:03.507 --> 32:05.230
- I'm sorry?
- No, I'm sorry.

32:05.642 --> 32:07.242
I never wanted to say that.

32:08.731 --> 32:11.665
But for you to say
anything to me besides,

32:11.690 --> 32:13.957
"Thank you for not hating me
after I came home

32:13.982 --> 32:15.682
and stole your whole life
right out from under you,"

32:15.707 --> 32:17.707
is way out of line.

32:17.732 --> 32:19.033
Neither one of us is exactly
where we ought to be.

32:19.058 --> 32:20.457
That's life.

32:20.482 --> 32:21.880
But you don't blame people for that.

32:23.546 --> 32:24.945
Check yourself.

32:31.247 --> 32:33.647
Well, not that you need
any more commotion

32:33.672 --> 32:35.405
after all that donnybrook,

32:35.430 --> 32:37.564
but it's been given to me that...

32:38.999 --> 32:41.599
Kevin and Charity might be divorcing.

32:41.634 --> 32:44.202
Of course, we all still hope that
they find a way to work it out,

32:44.237 --> 32:47.605
but if they don't, we will
be seeking your guidance.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.940
I'll do what I can.

32:48.975 --> 32:50.641
We're so fortunate to have you.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.443
We are.

32:53.454 --> 32:56.120
Very good. Yes.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.693
I'm sorry I got so angry.

33:08.753 --> 33:11.686
Oh, don't be. I'm not a fool.

33:11.711 --> 33:13.878
I know this place isn't up to code.

33:13.903 --> 33:15.955
It's actually not up to code?

33:15.980 --> 33:18.847
Well, no, I mean figuratively.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.371
Ah.

33:20.396 --> 33:24.198
When anyone calls me serious,
it just sets me off.

33:24.249 --> 33:28.517
Well, I mean, you are kind of...
intense.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.076
I know.

33:32.126 --> 33:35.618
Kerissa, I... I really don't
know how all this is gonna end.

33:35.643 --> 33:36.758
How what's gonna end?

33:36.783 --> 33:39.410
All this mess with Triumph II and...

33:39.435 --> 33:40.923
How do you mean?

33:41.013 --> 33:43.846
All the money that Basie's
putting into this

33:43.871 --> 33:46.839
and all the side deals that he's making.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.557
What kind of side deals?

33:48.582 --> 33:51.116
What are you talking about?

33:51.141 --> 33:55.210
Nothing, you know, just the commitments.

33:55.235 --> 33:58.036
I'm sure he knows what
he's doing, but, you know,

33:58.061 --> 33:59.271
a woman worries.

34:00.377 --> 34:02.606
That's what we do, isn't it?

34:02.713 --> 34:04.846
The men folk hurry, and the women worry.

34:05.195 --> 34:07.495
I've never heard that one before.

34:10.393 --> 34:12.659
I'm gonna find the money from somewhere,

34:12.795 --> 34:14.795
and we're gonna get you all fixed up.

34:14.909 --> 34:16.371
Okay.

34:17.219 --> 34:18.851
Thank you.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.348
<i>At the tone, record your message.</i>

34:26.373 --> 34:29.080
Aaron... Jeffries,

34:29.210 --> 34:32.143
acting general counsel
for Calvary Fellowship World...

34:33.514 --> 34:34.981
<i>If you are satisfied
with your greeting...</i>

34:35.005 --> 34:36.973
Hey, Kevin, wait up!

34:36.998 --> 34:39.532
- Don't forget.
- All right.

34:39.556 --> 34:41.623
Hey. So, how you settling in?

34:41.648 --> 34:43.880
- Good, good, thanks.
- Good, good.

34:43.906 --> 34:46.139
Hey, listen, Lady Mae told me

34:46.165 --> 34:48.565
that you and Charity
might be getting a divorce.

34:49.042 --> 34:51.781
Uh... yeah.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.757
Yeah, we're talking about it. Why?

34:53.782 --> 34:55.014
Do you have a lawyer yet?

34:56.822 --> 34:59.391
I assume you don't
from the way that you're...

34:59.416 --> 35:00.582
No, I haven't done that yet.

35:00.607 --> 35:03.108
Hey, look, it's no rush.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.566
But here.

35:04.591 --> 35:05.927
When you get one, have him call me.

35:05.952 --> 35:08.384
Or her, whatever the case may be.

35:11.151 --> 35:14.586
And... I'm sorry.

35:16.008 --> 35:17.207
Thanks.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.581
Hallelujah!

35:26.616 --> 35:29.650
Now, before we get started,
I just want to give

35:29.686 --> 35:31.719
a role call of blessings so we all know

35:31.754 --> 35:33.950
- that Jesus is Lord.
- Amen!

35:33.965 --> 35:37.133
After an incredibly successful
fall revival,

35:37.168 --> 35:39.635
- Cavalry is back in the black!
- Amen!

35:39.670 --> 35:41.169
We've hired a new general counsel,

35:41.205 --> 35:42.537
Mr. Aaron Jeffries,

35:42.572 --> 35:44.439
the son of Pastor Lionel Jeffries,

35:44.474 --> 35:47.375
whose preaching we all
so enjoyed at revival

35:47.410 --> 35:50.331
and who has already proved
his value 10 times over.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.957
Most importantly,
with Mr. Jeffries' help,

35:52.992 --> 35:55.326
we have filed an injunction
with the court

35:55.362 --> 35:56.993
to halt construction on Triumph II

35:57.028 --> 35:58.629
for at least one month,

35:58.664 --> 36:01.431
and we have reason to believe

36:01.467 --> 36:03.267
that we can delay it indefinitely.

36:03.302 --> 36:05.569
Or at least until they get up
and run across town.

36:05.604 --> 36:07.304
Amen.

36:07.339 --> 36:10.840
Now, with that in mind,
let's get down to business.

36:10.876 --> 36:14.277
And let's keep it short
because I ain't gonna lie.

36:14.312 --> 36:15.944
I'm hungry.

36:15.980 --> 36:18.110
All righty, then. Item one.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.400
The Sunday school conference
that we have every year

36:20.436 --> 36:22.069
is coming up next month.

36:22.105 --> 36:24.371
You all have in front of you
an itemized...

36:24.406 --> 36:26.612
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

36:26.648 --> 36:28.019
Amen.

36:28.745 --> 36:32.411
It was either lights or dinner,
and I went with dinner.

36:32.447 --> 36:35.248
I like it. Romantic.

36:35.283 --> 36:38.051
Oh, and get this, tomorrow,
an electrician is coming by

36:38.086 --> 36:40.820
to put a bid together
to rewire the whole house.

36:40.856 --> 36:42.355
How'd you pull that off?

36:42.390 --> 36:43.990
I threw a fit.

36:44.025 --> 36:45.725
I knew I married the right woman.

36:45.761 --> 36:47.692
Thank you, Lord.

36:47.728 --> 36:50.662
But there was something that Tasha
said, Jacob, in the heat of it.

36:50.697 --> 36:55.000
What, she drop some of her
feng shui logic on you?

36:55.035 --> 36:59.138
No, it was about money and Basie.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.139
Hmm.

37:02.442 --> 37:04.142
Do tell.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.446
Knock knock.

37:09.482 --> 37:11.315
Come in.

37:11.350 --> 37:14.218
- I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, no, not at all.

37:14.254 --> 37:16.888
I was just about to go for a
run, but, please, stop me.

37:16.923 --> 37:20.857
I made something, just a little
gesture to say thank you.

37:20.893 --> 37:22.307
What is it?

37:23.162 --> 37:25.728
Well...

37:25.764 --> 37:28.364
your mother was such an original person.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.834
I... I always envied her so.

37:30.869 --> 37:36.807
And she used to make
this grapefruit pound cake.

37:39.376 --> 37:41.376
Well, now I have to go for a run.

37:41.412 --> 37:44.980
Oh, well, it won't be as good as hers.

37:45.016 --> 37:48.184
Oh, nonsense, just to try it.

37:51.122 --> 37:52.454
Let's see.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.226
I love it.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.229
Thank you.

38:01.264 --> 38:02.864
Oh, you're welcome.

38:04.767 --> 38:05.934
Mmm.

38:08.205 --> 38:11.972
Well, I guess I'll just leave you to it.

38:12.007 --> 38:13.874
- Mae.
- Hmm?

38:15.878 --> 38:18.278
I'll never tell anyone
about you and Dad.

38:18.863 --> 38:20.247
What would be the point?

38:24.320 --> 38:26.019
Thank you.

38:29.324 --> 38:31.724
Some people's testimonies were so heavy.

38:31.759 --> 38:34.793
I felt really blessed by
the time the workshop was over.

38:34.829 --> 38:36.295
Sounds like a good day.

38:36.331 --> 38:38.697
Yeah, it was. I really had fun.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.367
I'm glad, honey. That's good.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.369
Can I come to the wedding tomorrow?

38:43.404 --> 38:45.238
I have to write a review of a sermon,

38:45.273 --> 38:48.073
and I thought I'd savage yours.

38:48.108 --> 38:51.809
Well, I'd be happy to share
my notes with you, honey,

38:51.845 --> 38:56.047
but, um... the wedding's been canceled.

38:56.083 --> 38:59.351
- Seriously?
- Yep.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.319
Why?

39:01.355 --> 39:03.087
They just decided not to get married.

39:03.122 --> 39:05.722
That's terrible. Why?

39:05.758 --> 39:07.996
It's a long and, uh...

39:08.761 --> 39:10.832
confidential story.

39:11.797 --> 39:14.031
I hate that.

39:14.066 --> 39:16.733
Should we pray for them?
It's not too late.

39:16.769 --> 39:18.769
Let's do it. Let's pray.

39:18.804 --> 39:20.270
I don't think it'll help, honey.

39:25.877 --> 39:27.877
Then...

39:27.913 --> 39:29.312
let's pray for you.

39:29.347 --> 39:32.115
Seems like a pastor who doesn't believe

39:32.150 --> 39:35.184
in the power of prayer could use some.

39:39.423 --> 39:40.945
Okay.

39:42.059 --> 39:43.325
Let's do it.

39:46.397 --> 39:47.762
Mmm.

39:51.068 --> 39:55.836
Dear God, thank you so much for my mom.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.338
She works so hard

39:57.373 --> 40:00.975
and fights so hard to do what's right,

40:01.010 --> 40:03.760
but she needs some support right now.

40:04.847 --> 40:07.881
Please let her know
that You're there for her,

40:07.917 --> 40:10.251
waiting whenever she needs you

40:10.286 --> 40:13.978
and that no matter what happens...

40:15.324 --> 40:16.940
You love her.

40:17.426 --> 40:20.460
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
