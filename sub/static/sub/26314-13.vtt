Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:02.540 --> 00:03.580
You trust Tegan?

00:03.580 --> 00:06.500
She recently got an e-mail
that caught I.T.'s attention.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.830
Annalise:
Emmett's watching you.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.620
Clearly something weird
is going on right now.

00:09.620 --> 00:10.290
You haven't
seen this yet?

00:10.290 --> 00:12.960
Anchor: An anonymous tip
led to the discovery

00:12.960 --> 00:14.000
of an abandoned car.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.670
This was Nate?

00:15.670 --> 00:17.750
Annalise tried to adopt
Wes Gibbins.

00:17.750 --> 00:18.880
I heard Miller
on the phone

00:18.880 --> 00:20.960
talking to someone
about the adoption.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.790
Who?
Someone named Lynne.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.120
FBI agents
were just seen arriving

00:25.120 --> 00:26.290
at the Governor's mansion.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.330
Connor needs to call
his mom right now.

00:28.330 --> 00:29.250
She just posted
a photo of us.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.380
With Nate
and Miller, too.

00:43.830 --> 00:45.620
♪ Happy Christmas ♪

00:45.620 --> 00:48.210
It's starting to look
a lot like Christmas!

00:48.210 --> 00:50.040
How did you even
afford this crap?

00:50.040 --> 00:52.120
Credit card.
No expenses will be spared

00:52.120 --> 00:53.920
for my son's
first Christmas.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.380
Ohh.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.790
This side needs
more ornaments.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.580
I don't think Christopher's
gonna notice.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.330
Okay, so, when do we
get to, like,

01:01.330 --> 01:03.120
eat chocolate cookies
and watch Hallmark movies?

01:03.120 --> 01:05.250
Uh, when you stop complaining
and start decorating!

01:05.250 --> 01:07.670
How fun is this,
mi amor?

01:09.710 --> 01:13.210
Hello?

01:13.210 --> 01:15.120
Hello?

01:18.670 --> 01:20.120
Maman?

01:21.920 --> 01:24.420
Your mother?

01:24.420 --> 01:26.170
-Maman, c'est toi?
-Oh, my God.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.830
Was it her?

01:34.330 --> 01:36.170
I'm just
being paranoid.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.000
Oliver.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.250
That's upside down.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.620
I don't understand.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.170
What are we doing
in a hotel?

01:50.170 --> 01:52.250
This is my apartment,
Mamma.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.790
My, oh, my. Oh, my.

02:00.790 --> 02:04.580
If I don't feel
like I'm visiting

02:04.580 --> 02:06.670
Miss Winfrey herself.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.500
My baby done good!

02:12.880 --> 02:14.080
How 'bout a nap?

02:15.580 --> 02:18.040
Not until you tell me
what I'm doing here.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.120
It's Christmas, Mamma.

02:20.120 --> 02:24.540
You fly all the way home
just to pick me up, though?

02:24.540 --> 02:27.080
Celestine should see
this mansion, too!
I know,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.210
but I wanted you
all to myself.

02:29.210 --> 02:30.210
We can do
whatever we want.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.210
We could watch TV,
pig out.

02:32.210 --> 02:33.380
I'll do
all the cooking...

02:35.420 --> 02:36.790
Mamma,
what is it?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.290
Hm?

02:38.290 --> 02:41.000
My baby is living
her best life.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.210
I'm so proud of you.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.380
Proud.

02:48.380 --> 02:49.250
Just proud.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.000
Oh.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.290
What's the matter?
Phone.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.080
Give me a minute.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.420
Annalise: Hello?

03:03.420 --> 03:05.580
Agent Telesco: Ms. Keating,
Agent Telesco with the FBI.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.000
Are you free to come in
and answer a few questions?

03:09.420 --> 03:10.620
My mother's visiting.

03:10.620 --> 03:11.710
Listen.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.380
We know you tried
to adopt Wes Gibbins.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.330
What case are you
working here, exactly?

03:18.330 --> 03:20.210
Miller's
or my husband's?

03:20.210 --> 03:21.710
Let's have this conversation
in person.

03:21.710 --> 03:23.290
I'm hanging up --
We're prepared
to offer you

03:23.290 --> 03:24.960
complete immunity,
Ms. Keating.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.790
For what?

03:29.790 --> 03:32.960
All of it.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.250
Just come in.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.210
After the holiday.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.420
Not visiting your mom
for Christmas?

03:56.420 --> 03:57.670
Don't talk to me
about my mom.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.710
I'm here to make amends.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.960
Gabriel:
I told the Feds everything
Annalise wanted me to.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.500
Why are you here?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.620
To kiss and make up.
Just leave.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.250
I would've told Annalise
who you were months ago

04:15.250 --> 04:17.170
if I thought
you were a bad guy.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.080
But I didn't,
and now she hates me.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.880
Ain't that enough
for you?

04:21.880 --> 04:24.330
You wanna know
why I didn't go home?

04:24.330 --> 04:27.080
My mother would've asked me
a thousand questions,

04:27.080 --> 04:30.250
any of which I answer
with the truth

04:30.250 --> 04:31.790
would've sent her
on a pill binge.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.120
So you're
protecting her.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.380
No, I'm lying to her,
every day.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.210
And maybe you're okay
with doing that, but...

04:37.210 --> 04:40.960
she's a good person,
and she deserves better.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.120
She deserved better
than Sam, too.

04:44.330 --> 04:45.540
So did you.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.880
Sheila:
Ronnie wasn't just my son.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.920
He was my friend.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.330
He would come over
on weekends.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.000
We'd watch the Eagles --

05:00.000 --> 05:03.500
he'd make his famous
seven-layer dip.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.460
Maybe it's 'cause
he was my only child,

05:06.460 --> 05:10.880
but I always felt that
our connection was rare.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.290
It's my faith
that lets me know

05:14.290 --> 05:17.540
that Ronnie is not alone.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.920
He is with his father...

05:20.920 --> 05:24.540
who I know is
so very glad to see him.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.710
Thank you so much
for coming.

05:36.710 --> 05:37.920
Of course.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.330
Hello.
Um, Asher Millstone.

05:43.330 --> 05:44.920
I was
your son's intern.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.290
-Oh.
-He's my mentor,

05:47.290 --> 05:49.920
more than
he needed to be.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
Really believed
in my potential and...

05:54.080 --> 05:55.330
Um, I'll let you...

06:00.120 --> 06:02.620
-What have you heard?
-Just what's on the news.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.540
But you knew the Governor
was involved before we talked.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.790
How?

06:06.790 --> 06:09.170
I just heard
what the police told you.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.620
You know I couldn't
even see his body?

06:13.620 --> 06:16.790
They used bleach on him.
He was unrecognizable.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.670
I'm so sorry.
Listen, Bonnie.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.250
You need to catch
the people who did this

06:24.250 --> 06:26.500
and make sure
they get the death penalty

06:26.500 --> 06:28.750
so I can
watch them die.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.540
Reporter: Police have revealed
new information

06:32.540 --> 06:34.830
about the murder
of D.A. Ronald Miller --

06:34.830 --> 06:37.170
namely, that the bleach
and acid used

06:37.170 --> 06:39.040
in the disposal of his body

06:39.040 --> 06:41.580
match a previous murder
allegedly committed

06:41.580 --> 06:44.120
by an employee
of Moretti Construction.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.960
The Moretti Family
was a top donor

06:45.960 --> 06:48.290
in Governor Birkhead's
last campaign,

06:48.290 --> 06:49.620
therefore offering
one reason as to...

06:49.620 --> 06:52.170
-Nate is so smart.
-...why the FBI questioned

06:52.170 --> 06:54.380
the Governor about
the D.A. last --

06:54.380 --> 06:56.420
Hey!

06:56.420 --> 06:58.750
-No more murder.
-Great. My mom's almost here.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.330
Aw, she's gonna be sad that
Asher's not here to greet her.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.960
No more Asher jokes.
She's feeling very sensitive

07:03.960 --> 07:06.250
ever since I had her remove
that photo from Instagram.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.580
Why? Because she's
in love with him?

07:07.580 --> 07:08.830
No, because
she's ashamed,

07:08.830 --> 07:10.170
as she should be.

07:10.170 --> 07:11.290
So let's all
just act normal,

07:11.290 --> 07:13.000
and maybe
she won't notice

07:13.000 --> 07:14.670
that we're all terrified
about going to jail.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.120
Well, she didn't notice that her
husband was gay for 20 years,

07:17.120 --> 07:18.830
so I think
we're good.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.290
Normal and happy,
okay?

07:22.290 --> 07:25.290
Happy holidays!
Hi.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.830
-Hi!
-Hi!

07:26.830 --> 07:28.670
-Hi!
-Hey!

07:28.670 --> 07:31.580
-It's so good to see you.
-Honey! Oh, nice to see you!

07:32.920 --> 07:35.120
Ophelia:
There he is!

07:35.120 --> 07:38.000
Come wrap them
big arms around me.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.580
-Don't hurt him, Mamma.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.290
-How you doing, Miss Ophelia?

07:41.290 --> 07:43.040
Better than ever.
And your daddy?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.460
How's he doing?
Mamma...

07:45.460 --> 07:47.960
Please tell me he's coming
for dinner tomorrow.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.210
He's a little bit
under the weather,

07:49.210 --> 07:51.790
but maybe you can
see him next time.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.710
I understand.
But that's a promise.

07:54.710 --> 07:56.620
Of course.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.420
Mamma, let's get you
to bed now.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.040
-I'm not going to bed.
-Okay, Mamma.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.290
I don't need
to go to no bed.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.420
People go to bed
at nighttime.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.710
That's when people
go to sleep.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.250
-It's nice you invited her.
-It's selfish.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.620
She's keeping me from drinking
my way into the new year.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.210
Now, what's going on?

08:20.210 --> 08:22.880
Telesco wants me to come in
for an interview.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.250
Okay.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.750
That means your plan
is not working.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.120
The body already
led them to the Governor --

08:27.120 --> 08:28.620
Then why are they
offering me immunity?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.210
You gonna take it?
Stop --

08:33.210 --> 08:34.380
You have nothing
to do with this --

08:34.380 --> 08:35.920
So you think I should
sell you out,

08:35.920 --> 08:37.830
put you in jail?
You've done it before.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.170
This is what they want,
Annalise --

08:42.170 --> 08:43.420
turn us
against each other.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.620
That's the only way
this thing falls apart.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.580
There are a million ways
that this could fall apart.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.750
Listen to me,
right now.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.790
I can take care of myself,
and I believe I've done that.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.210
But if you feel like
that's too much,

08:54.210 --> 08:55.500
then maybe you should
take the deal.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.790
That's not
what I want.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.420
You say that now.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.000
Wait until the deal's
in front of you.

09:20.670 --> 09:22.210
Drinking again?

09:24.210 --> 09:26.250
Course not.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.250
I heard you and
Nathaniel talking.

09:31.420 --> 09:33.670
Now, what trouble
you got yourself in?

09:33.670 --> 09:35.210
None.

09:35.210 --> 09:38.420
Then what is this deal
you're thinking about taking?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.250
It's a legal matter,
Mamma.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.330
It's --
It's about my work.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.960
But it can hurt Nathaniel if you
take it -- ain't this right?

09:49.330 --> 09:51.580
Don't you dare do that.

09:51.580 --> 09:54.170
Nathaniel
is a good man.

09:54.170 --> 09:55.710
Not as good
as you think.

09:58.580 --> 09:59.580
Let's go
to sleep, Mamma.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.330
We got a big day
tomorrow.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.920
Smile!
Smile, Christopher!

10:20.920 --> 10:23.460
Ho, ho.
It's the beard.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.670
He can sense
I can't grow my own.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.540
Here, Mom. I'll take
a photo of you and Oli.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.210
Oh, love that.

10:29.210 --> 10:31.080
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh ♪

10:31.080 --> 10:32.620
Oh.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.120
Check there
aren't other photos.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.540
Why do you think I asked?

10:35.540 --> 10:36.830
Pam: What are you guys
whispering about?

10:36.830 --> 10:38.960
Oh, I was just
saying how jealous I am

10:38.960 --> 10:40.830
that Connor has you.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.330
My mother's idea of Christmas
is running a toys-for-tots scam

10:43.330 --> 10:44.750
to pay off
her gambling debts.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.120
Well, I guess that explains
why you're not spending

10:46.120 --> 10:48.170
the holidays
with your family.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.710
What about you, Laurel?
-Mom, don't be nosey.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.040
Ho, ho, ho.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.460
Can I talk
to you both?

10:55.460 --> 10:56.920
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh ♪

10:56.920 --> 10:58.830
♪ I hear... ♪

10:58.830 --> 11:01.210
♪ On the ceiling tonight ♪

11:01.210 --> 11:02.960
-Who is that?
-Mom, no.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.080
Gabriel's gonna spend
Christmas here with you guys.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.420
No, he's not.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.040
I already made Asher
invite him.
Why?

11:10.040 --> 11:12.330
Sad, lonely people
do stupid things.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.580
This is an easy way
to keep him on our side.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.500
Maybe just wear something
a little more form-fitting.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.920
-Frank --
-Did Laurel tell you she got

11:17.920 --> 11:19.500
a creepy call
from a mouth-breather?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.460
It was a blocked number,
and they hung up.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.880
She thinks
it was her mother.
I don't know that,
though.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.210
You'll tell us
if we're not safe?

11:24.210 --> 11:25.790
Just let me know
if it happens again.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.620
It's Christmas, okay?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.960
We can all afford to have
one nice day a year.

11:41.380 --> 11:42.790
Agent Telesco:
Ms. Price.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.500
This is my home.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
I wouldn't be here
if you'd return my calls.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.710
You are the one person who can
find out what Annalise knows.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.000
I was with her when the news
of Miller's body broke.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.500
She doesn't know
anything.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.960
Is that why you're okay
going to her Christmas dinner?

12:05.170 --> 12:06.960
Call me if you find out
anything.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.460
Hey.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.880
Why are you
working today?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.710
I wasn't invited
to Annalise's.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.170
Thought pie would be
better than booze.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.420
Oh.
Did you talk to them?

12:27.460 --> 12:28.830
Gabe's gonna be
at their house all day.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.170
We're good.
Okay.

12:30.170 --> 12:31.790
You okay?
God, I will be

12:31.790 --> 12:33.250
once my mother
is away from the stove.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.670
Mamma!

12:37.790 --> 12:39.880
There's the man.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.670
I gotta hand it to you.
I had my doubts,

12:41.670 --> 12:44.620
but copycatting the Moretti hit
was pure genius.

12:46.290 --> 12:48.380
Dude.
I'll fix that later.

12:48.380 --> 12:50.670
Quiet. I didn't want
to tell Bonnie,

12:50.670 --> 12:53.250
but the FBI's calling
Annalise in for an interview.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.920
They're offering
her immunity.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.670
She should take it.

12:57.830 --> 13:00.170
She's the only one of us
that hasn't actually...

13:00.170 --> 13:02.120
you know...

13:27.500 --> 13:29.460
What's wrong with you?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.500
What do you think?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.790
I told you not
to go to that funeral.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.210
Like I had a choice.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.580
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.170
Annalise...

13:42.170 --> 13:43.790
Emmett:
Nice to see you.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.500
Can you trust her?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
Can I trust anyone
at this point?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.330
-Hey.
-Hello.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.040
-Merry Christmas.
-Ooh, salsa partner!

13:54.040 --> 13:55.670
Emmett:
Merry Christmas.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.750
Asher!
Perfect timing.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.120
Take off
your shirt.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.710
-What?
-What? No, not for --

14:06.710 --> 14:08.830
Uh, I-I'm giving
everyone their presents.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.880
-Uh-huh.
-Ugly Christmas sweaters!

14:10.880 --> 14:12.670
-Ah.
-Here!

14:12.670 --> 14:15.920
Oh, Gabriel, I'm so sorry.
I-I don't have an extra.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.830
-I think I'll be okay.
-Ah.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.710
Hey, uh,
you can't be nice to her.

14:19.710 --> 14:21.250
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll just, uh,

14:21.250 --> 14:23.040
bring out the old
"hit it and quit it" Asher.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.250
You just
made it worse.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.420
Beer or wine?

14:29.420 --> 14:30.460
Beer.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.710
Thanks
for having me.
Thank Frank.

14:34.710 --> 14:37.000
He made us invite you.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.120
Oh, and, uh, no flirting
with Michaela.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
All right. Uh...
Thanks.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.330
Listen up.

14:49.330 --> 14:51.500
Annalise: Oh, no. We --
We are not doing toasts.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.620
Oh, you can handle
a few compliments, Annalise.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.380
To those I'm --
I'm just meeting,

14:56.380 --> 14:59.040
Mrs. Harkness, uh,
thank you for sparing me

14:59.040 --> 15:02.120
from having to, uh,
dine alone at an IHOP.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.380
To Annalise,
our lovely host,

15:05.380 --> 15:09.040
please know how grateful
I feel to be here today.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.670
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.710
Who are you?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.960
Mamma,
Emmett is my boss.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.960
Way you were talking,
I thought that you were...

15:18.960 --> 15:21.170
a new boyfriend.
Okay, let's eat.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.290
My baby
is generous, though.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.330
Although that's not the first
word that comes to mind

15:28.330 --> 15:29.830
when you mention
Anna Mae.

15:32.420 --> 15:34.790
-Anna Mae?
-First grade, I get a call

15:34.790 --> 15:35.790
from the principal...

15:35.790 --> 15:37.500
We're not
doing this, Mamma.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.580
No, no, we gotta
hear this.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.290
...wanting to know if everything
was all right at home,

15:42.290 --> 15:45.620
'cause Anna Mae never
had any lunch to eat.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.460
I started yelling
at that man.

15:50.460 --> 15:53.000
How dare you accuse me

15:53.000 --> 15:56.330
of neglecting my child?

15:56.330 --> 15:59.290
Turned out that Ms. Anna Mae
was giving her lunch

15:59.290 --> 16:01.830
to a homeless man
on her way to school.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.330
I didn't do that.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.710
Yes, you did.
You don't remember.

16:07.170 --> 16:11.040
That's why
you're a lawyer, baby.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.000
And that's why
you teach.

16:14.750 --> 16:20.420
You will always be
my generous baby girl,

16:20.420 --> 16:23.330
whether you like it
or not.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.380
-Are you finished?
-Yes, I am.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.120
Okay, then I order
all of you to eat

16:31.120 --> 16:32.750
so that your mouths
are full

16:32.750 --> 16:34.580
so that you won't be able
to talk about me.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.210
You have to got
to see this place, Mac Daddy.

16:49.210 --> 16:52.920
Anna Mae is
in the big money now.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.420
I miss you, too,
my Mac Daddy.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.420
And Anna Mae misses you --

16:58.420 --> 17:01.500
Yes, she does!
She said it right to my face.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.580
Hey.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.330
I miss that, too.

17:04.330 --> 17:06.080
That story up at dinner
about you and me?

17:07.580 --> 17:09.790
Hm?
You ought to behave yourself.
Shame on you.

17:09.790 --> 17:13.210
I think she heard us,
wants you to help me.

17:13.210 --> 17:16.540
That wasn't me
in the story.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.960
It was Celestine.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.080
No way in hell would I
ever give away my lunch.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.330
I miss you
kissing on me.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.790
I'm -- All right.
Back off, now.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.080
Don't get naughty.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.960
Don't get naughty on me.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.120
Bonnie?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.250
I haven't had a chance
to say this,

17:38.250 --> 17:41.670
but please accept
my condolences.

17:41.670 --> 17:43.330
I can't imagine
how hard this is.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.580
How did you know
we were together?

17:48.290 --> 17:50.710
Our friends
at the D.A.'s.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.540
Was it not
public knowledge?

17:54.540 --> 17:55.710
No.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.420
I'm not feeling well.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.620
-Everyone dig in.
-Mmm.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.170
Don't forget
your roughage.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.790
Oliver.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.540
Oh, come on,
Connor.

18:20.420 --> 18:24.080
Hey, Mom, why don't you
have something to eat?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.830
Don't you take
his side, Oliver.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.330
Take his side
about what?

18:27.330 --> 18:28.540
We don't need
to talk about it.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.460
-Asher and I had an encounter.
-Mom...

18:31.460 --> 18:33.500
It was not
my finest moment,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.920
but we're all adults
with needs.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.790
-Stop. I'm begging you.
-And if another adult

18:39.790 --> 18:42.830
with their own needs
wants to do something that,

18:42.830 --> 18:44.420
you know, nobody's done
for me in a very long time,

18:44.420 --> 18:46.250
he should be praised
for that.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.580
Right?

18:47.580 --> 18:49.500
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna
go to the restroom.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.120
Mmm. This mac and cheese
is really good, babe.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.210
Yeah, and let me remind you,
Connor Morgan,

18:54.210 --> 18:56.420
I was the mom who let
her teenage son

18:56.420 --> 18:59.210
have sex with a 23-year-old man
in her home.

18:59.210 --> 19:01.580
-That happened?
-None of you realize

19:01.580 --> 19:05.080
how much parents sacrifice
their own happiness

19:05.080 --> 19:07.420
for their children.
-Laurel has a child.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.460
Yes, well, then, she gets
how hurtful it would be

19:09.460 --> 19:12.460
if Christopher decided not
to spend Christmas with her.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.790
-You're here.
-I know, but the rest of you.

19:15.790 --> 19:18.580
Where are your parents?
W-Why aren't you calling them?

19:18.580 --> 19:21.120
Because I can guarantee you,
they're heartbroken

19:21.120 --> 19:23.380
none of you are choosing to
spend the holidays with them.

19:23.380 --> 19:26.000
Oh.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.330
Special Agent Telesco
from the FBI.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.420
Are you
Oliver Hampton?
Yes.

19:33.420 --> 19:36.500
And, uh,
your husband.
That's me.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.000
I have a warrant
for your wedding photos.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.540
Where's Tegan?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.710
Uh, she had -- had
to go see a friend.

19:58.710 --> 19:59.960
I'll call an Uber
just as soon

19:59.960 --> 20:01.790
as I get these leftovers
in order.

20:01.790 --> 20:03.620
Take them home.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.380
Yeah, to my, uh,
mini-fridge at the hotel?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.710
At least tell me that
they gave you a suite.

20:09.710 --> 20:12.420
Oh, yeah, so I have more room
to, uh, be by myself in?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.670
Well,
it works for me.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.170
Does it?
You know, I-I get it,

20:16.170 --> 20:18.170
'cause you have, uh,
a lot more than I do.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.080
What do I have
that you don't?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.330
You have
a great mother

20:24.330 --> 20:26.040
and friends
who admire you.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.460
That doesn't mean
they like me.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.880
Why don't you just
accept that we do?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.460
"We"?

20:31.460 --> 20:32.750
Yeah, we.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.420
Okay, well,
all I'm saying is,

20:37.420 --> 20:39.710
is that you have
this whole life that,

20:39.710 --> 20:41.750
you know, you don't
share at work.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.040
Today you did.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.830
And you made me
feel at home,

20:45.830 --> 20:48.920
and I haven't felt at home
anywhere in a really long time.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.540
So thank you
for that.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.250
Well...

21:06.000 --> 21:07.380
It's late.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.670
Yeah, I'll go.

21:12.670 --> 21:13.750
Mm.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.460
Sorry, precioso.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.710
No crying, okay?

22:06.210 --> 22:07.830
Do we need
to call your father?

22:07.830 --> 22:09.880
He does tax law.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.580
Why didn't you tell me
that District Attorney

22:11.580 --> 22:13.790
was at the wedding?
I didn't know.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.540
I guess Bonnie was dating him,
and he showed up.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.710
Well, I'm not drunk
anymore, Connor.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.250
And they're asking
for photos,

22:19.250 --> 22:20.540
and you had me
delete a photo.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.540
Yeah, because you hooked up
with my friend.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.830
Can I jump in?
Um...

22:26.670 --> 22:29.040
I'm an intern
at the D.A.'s office,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.210
and I know
the guy who died.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.080
It's a really sad
situation,

22:33.080 --> 22:35.790
so the FBI's
just doing their job.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.750
Connor just didn't want
your memories of the wedding

22:37.750 --> 22:38.830
to be ruined.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.880
Thank God you went to
the bathroom when you did.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.790
They already know
I'm on your guys' side.

22:55.790 --> 22:57.330
Are you?
I can leave

22:57.330 --> 22:59.120
if you all
don't trust me.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.620
Just take this peace offering
and entertain yourself.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.170
Let me ask you
something.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.330
This whole time,

23:06.330 --> 23:09.670
all anyone's ever told me
is that Sam's a bad guy.

23:09.670 --> 23:12.540
I told you,
we barely even knew him.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.540
Just tell me one thing
you remember about him.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.670
-Get off!
-Laurel!

23:16.670 --> 23:17.500
Aah!

23:17.500 --> 23:19.380
Aaaah!
Aaaah!

23:19.380 --> 23:20.210
Oh, God.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.250
I'm sorry.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.380
There's nothing
I can tell you.

23:25.380 --> 23:27.670
How do you not want to find
your birth parents?

23:27.670 --> 23:30.210
You looked for yours. You feel
good about what you found?

23:30.210 --> 23:33.250
-Actually, yeah, I do.
-How?

23:33.250 --> 23:35.460
He impregnated a student
and then murdered her.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.500
Well, at least
I'm not wondering anymore,

23:38.500 --> 23:40.330
walking around with
this whole abandonment complex.

23:40.330 --> 23:41.580
Well, there's where
we're different.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.710
I never felt abandoned.

23:42.710 --> 23:44.000
I don't believe you.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.330
Y-- Stop projecting
on me.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.880
You know what?
I'm taking my wine back.

23:51.670 --> 23:53.750
Connor: This isn't legal
under the 4th Amendment.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.420
Read the warrant
closer.

23:55.420 --> 23:57.330
-What's going on?
-They're now saying

23:57.330 --> 23:58.710
they have to take my laptop.
-What?!

23:58.710 --> 24:00.960
Ms. Castillo,
nice to see you again.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.000
You can't do this.
It actually says they can
take anything

24:03.000 --> 24:04.620
that might help with
the investigation.

24:04.620 --> 24:07.000
Okay, but why haven't you looked
into my father for this?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
He killed Denver --
he must've done this, too.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.500
The evidence isn't leading us
to your father.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.710
Well, where is it
leading to?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.540
Here, apparently.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.330
We'll be in touch.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.960
Some drama
after you left.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.000
The Feds raided the kids' house,
took Oli's laptop.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.330
Maybe you can ask
what they're looking for

24:32.330 --> 24:33.880
when you're back
in the office?

24:36.460 --> 24:37.880
Bon?

24:45.880 --> 24:49.000
I should've gone with you
to the funeral.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.420
I'm sorry.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.000
I'm a week late.

24:58.670 --> 25:02.580
I've been feeling dizzy
the last few days, too.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.290
And nauseous.

25:09.670 --> 25:12.620
You, uh...

25:12.620 --> 25:14.040
take a pregnancy test?

25:16.830 --> 25:19.500
I can't do this.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.620
Hey.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.830
You got me.

25:28.830 --> 25:31.420
No matter what happens,

25:31.420 --> 25:32.620
I'm here.

25:46.830 --> 25:48.210
Frank: Tell me there's nothing
they can find.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.330
Oliver: There's definitely
things they could find.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.920
They just won't.
-Are you sure?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.670
I'm the only one who can
get past my firewalls.
This is the FBI.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.420
As long as they don't have
my passwords, we're fine.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.380
We're not fine as long
as my mother's threatening

25:57.380 --> 25:59.790
to call my father.
It's my father
I'm most worried about.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.540
Maybe he's the one
prank-calling me.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.540
Then I'm not safe,
and neither is Christopher.

26:04.540 --> 26:06.920
So maybe I go to the FBI,
talk to Telesco...
What's wrong?

26:06.920 --> 26:09.330
...see if I can get her
to focus on my father instead.
It's just a bug.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.920
-Annalise?
-Hm?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.580
Do you think that I should
talk to Telesco about this?

26:12.580 --> 26:14.000
I'm already going
to talk to her,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.710
so don't do anything
until after.

26:15.710 --> 26:17.250
Why are you talking
to the FBI?

26:17.250 --> 26:19.170
They called me in
for an interview.

26:23.620 --> 26:27.420
We've escaped this long,
so why should that change?

26:33.460 --> 26:35.290
Hey.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.000
What are you
thinking?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.670
Nate told me
about the immunity.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.120
Did you tell Bonnie?

26:44.120 --> 26:45.380
No.

26:45.380 --> 26:46.750
Good.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.380
Why don't you just admit
you're here to babysit me?

26:54.380 --> 26:57.170
Oh, no.
Just to hang out.

26:57.170 --> 26:58.670
Yeah.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.710
I have a present
for you.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.540
From your father,
really.

27:09.460 --> 27:14.920
We started writing to each other
after the Supreme Court.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.920
And then he passed,

27:17.920 --> 27:21.000
and I thought you would like
to know how proud he was.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.540
Thank you.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.380
What's wrong?

27:32.380 --> 27:36.170
Why does something
always have to be wrong?

27:36.170 --> 27:37.880
-That's right,

27:37.880 --> 27:40.250
because both of you
always getting yourself

27:40.250 --> 27:41.620
in some kind
of trouble.

27:41.620 --> 27:42.880
Mamma, we're fine.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.960
You're not fine.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.170
You'd be fine
if you got married.

27:49.750 --> 27:54.880
So you wouldn't have to testify
against each other.

27:54.880 --> 28:00.000
Isn't that what you lawyers
call "spousal privilege"?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.420
Isn't that
what you call it?

28:01.420 --> 28:03.540
Huh?

28:03.540 --> 28:06.000
I don't know.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.540
I'm just saying it,
if you...

28:08.540 --> 28:11.120
I'm gonna mind my business.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.580
You left so you could talk
about what's going on

28:17.580 --> 28:18.790
without me hearing.

28:18.790 --> 28:21.380
Uh, it was just a boring
legal conversation.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.540
Yeah, it was so boring,
I wish I could've skipped it.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.170
Oliver,
you're a wonderful singer,

28:25.170 --> 28:26.750
but a terrible liar.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.880
Just give us a second.

28:37.790 --> 28:39.670
Tell me
the truth.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.170
Otherwise I'm packing you
in my suitcase

28:41.170 --> 28:43.710
and I'm taking you home.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.380
You can't tell Dad.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.500
Oh...
Promise.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.000
I won't.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.710
Um...

28:53.710 --> 28:56.290
This all involves
the Governor.

28:56.290 --> 28:58.250
I know. I-I read all about
that investigation online.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.960
Yeah, but what
you don't know

28:59.960 --> 29:03.580
is that the Governor's
been coming after Annalise.

29:03.580 --> 29:06.460
It's all because we won
our Supreme Court case.

29:06.460 --> 29:09.830
And now the FBI is working
with the Governor

29:09.830 --> 29:13.880
to try and scare us
into dropping clients.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.620
This is not making me
feel better.
Of course not.

29:16.620 --> 29:19.210
But that's...

29:20.830 --> 29:24.210
...the type of man that
you raised me to be --

29:24.210 --> 29:27.460
to live a life that's about
something bigger than myself.

29:30.170 --> 29:32.210
And that feels
really good.

29:32.210 --> 29:33.920
Even if it means the FBI

29:33.920 --> 29:35.790
has to show up
at my house sometimes.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.250
I hate all this.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.880
But I'm so proud
of you.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.540
Annalise: Mamma?

30:05.330 --> 30:09.080
You're sad
because I gotta go.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
So am I.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.620
Then stay.

30:15.790 --> 30:17.620
Your Daddy
wouldn't like that.

30:20.830 --> 30:24.960
I know that you're mad at me
still for taking him back.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.880
Oh, Mamma, I'm happy
if you're happy.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.750
Anna Mae, I'm happy
because I make myself happy,

30:30.750 --> 30:33.670
and I make myself happy
by loving him.

30:33.670 --> 30:36.620
Oh.

30:36.620 --> 30:40.420
God knows
I tried not to,

30:40.420 --> 30:43.580
just worrying about myself
and my children.

30:43.580 --> 30:47.120
Well, I worry about more
than just myself, Mamma.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.040
I know that.
Do you?

30:50.040 --> 30:52.290
'Cause it sounds like you want
me to be that little girl

30:52.290 --> 30:54.710
who goes hungry
so everyone else can eat.

30:54.710 --> 30:58.040
Nobody wants you
to go hungry, Anna Mae.

30:59.170 --> 31:02.250
You know that.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.750
We just want you
to be happy.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.540
Sam had a son.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.920
With his first wife.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.040
His name is Gabriel.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.040
I didn't know
until now.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.460
Sam lied
all that time.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.420
Bastard.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.420
Every man I ever loved
has hurt me, Mamma.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.330
And I'm not you.
I can't forgive and forget.

31:34.330 --> 31:35.920
I tried, but...

31:39.620 --> 31:41.000
And I don't want
to let anyone else in.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.330
I just want
to be alone.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.330
How in the hell are you alone
when I'm here?

31:46.330 --> 31:48.380
Because you're packing up
to go home,

31:48.380 --> 31:50.960
and I'm gonna be left here
to do what?

31:52.290 --> 31:54.420
Save everyone else,
even if it kills me?

31:56.920 --> 31:58.540
What about me
saving myself?

32:02.880 --> 32:08.080
Only by saving
everyone else...

32:08.080 --> 32:10.540
can you save you.
Oh.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.880
Loving your Daddy
was not for him.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.040
It was for me.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.880
Because that love
fills me up.

32:21.880 --> 32:27.880
Just like my love for you
fills me up.

32:30.040 --> 32:35.210
And, God Almighty, I wish
you knew what it was like

32:35.210 --> 32:40.620
for a mamma
to love her child,

32:40.620 --> 32:42.710
but you gotta
take what you got.

32:45.420 --> 32:51.040
And all you got right now
is Nathaniel.

32:51.040 --> 32:56.080
What about me
loving myself, Mamma?

32:56.080 --> 33:00.710
Doesn't that count
for anything?

33:00.710 --> 33:04.000
You'll never
love yourself

33:04.000 --> 33:07.250
if you hurt people,
Anna Mae.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.210
We both know that.

33:18.290 --> 33:21.500
We're all right,
baby.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.080
We're all right.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.250
Agent Telesco:
Hello?

33:57.250 --> 33:59.210
I can meet you tomorrow
at 3:00.

33:59.210 --> 34:00.620
Does that work?

34:00.620 --> 34:03.120
Of course.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.460
Should I prepare
immunity paperwork?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.080
I don't see why not.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.710
Well,
I'll see you then.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.920
You're offering
Annalise immunity?

34:14.920 --> 34:18.460
Unless you can give me a reason
why she doesn't deserve it.

34:36.330 --> 34:38.080
Agent Telesco
will be in shortly.

34:56.330 --> 34:58.830
Hey, Ma.

34:58.830 --> 35:02.210
You got the present
I sent you?

35:02.210 --> 35:05.080
See, I do pay attention.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.170
Yeah, I-I-I actually spent
the day with Michaela.

Of course.

I mean it, Claire.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.290
I've got no one.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.710
You've got me.

38:05.710 --> 38:08.460
You don't care about me.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.460
You work past 9:00
every night...

38:12.460 --> 38:15.580
never leave your house
on Sundays.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.460
Great.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.170
So you know I'm pathetic
and single.

38:20.170 --> 38:23.170
If that makes you
pathetic,

38:23.170 --> 38:24.540
so am I.

38:26.710 --> 38:28.920
You're single?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.960
You're surprised?

38:49.750 --> 38:50.920
Claire...

38:52.710 --> 38:54.540
Come here.

39:21.330 --> 39:23.080
Agent Lanford:
Did you feel coerced?

39:23.080 --> 39:24.710
Not at all.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.080
Claire and I both
share the blame

39:26.080 --> 39:27.920
for crossing
that line.

39:27.920 --> 39:32.210
But my personal safety
is still at risk,

39:32.210 --> 39:34.000
so I'd feel
more comfortable

39:34.000 --> 39:36.290
if I was reassigned
to a new agent.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.580
Agent Telesco:
You're overreacting!

39:37.580 --> 39:40.710
This has become a pattern
of misconduct.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.580
In the past month alone,
you've planted evidence...

39:42.580 --> 39:43.880
Annalise:
Now, as you can see,

39:43.880 --> 39:45.670
the agent
plants the evidence

39:45.670 --> 39:48.290
that the FBI can't find
in the first place.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.580
...you offered a deal
to a defendant

39:49.580 --> 39:51.000
without
his lawyer present...

39:51.000 --> 39:52.290
Gabriel: I'm not doing this
without my lawyer.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.710
So you don't want us
to drop the charges?

39:54.710 --> 39:58.170
...and now you have slept
with an informant,

39:58.170 --> 40:01.420
an act that could discredit
this entire investigation.

40:01.420 --> 40:03.710
This is Keating
playing us.

40:03.710 --> 40:06.380
All of our hard evidence
points to Birkhead.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.330
It's planted evidence --
We just got the report
on Miller's car.

40:09.330 --> 40:11.380
The dirt on his tires
matches the soil

40:11.380 --> 40:13.790
at the Moretti
construction site.

40:15.540 --> 40:18.420
Claire, no one has worked
harder on this than you.

40:18.420 --> 40:19.920
But I'm gonna have to
take you off Bonfire

40:19.920 --> 40:21.380
until further notice.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.420
I'm sorry,
Ms. Keating.

40:28.420 --> 40:29.500
We're going to have
to reschedule you.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.790
Why?

40:30.790 --> 40:31.960
I'm not
at liberty to say.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.040
Why are you
doing this?

40:44.040 --> 40:47.330
The same reason little Anna Mae
gave up her lunch.

40:47.330 --> 40:48.920
And don't relax too much.

40:48.920 --> 40:50.420
I just bought you time

40:50.420 --> 40:53.420
until Telesco's replacement
catches up.

40:53.420 --> 40:54.710
You can sleep
with that one.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.170
I don't know
what to say.

40:59.170 --> 41:00.460
Then that's all
you need to say.

41:19.830 --> 41:21.080
This is Annalise.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.380
I came here against
my better judgment.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.250
I'm glad you did.

41:40.750 --> 41:42.250
I want to end this,
Annalise.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.960
Then confess.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.040
We're in the right place
for it.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.580
None of this was me.

41:47.580 --> 41:49.000
D.A. Miller,
Nate Lahey Senior --

41:49.000 --> 41:50.750
You could've lied to me
over the phone.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.540
I know who killed
Nate Senior.

41:55.170 --> 41:56.500
You know him, too.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.750
Emmett Crawford.
