01:00.666 --> 01:02.668
- It's culs-de-sac. 
- No way!

01:02.740 --> 01:03.430
It is.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.643
The plural of cul-de-sac is culs-de-sac?

01:06.143 --> 01:07.557
That doesn't even sound like English.

01:07.675 --> 01:08.720
That's because it's French.

01:08.831 --> 01:09.661
You know what I mean.

01:09.886 --> 01:11.443
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

01:11.602 --> 01:13.511
Words should sound right to be right.

01:13.604 --> 01:14.592
That's not how it works.

01:14.679 --> 01:17.557
So, what, the plural of yo-yo is yos-yo?

01:17.889 --> 01:19.452
Yeah, 'cause that sounds so natural.

01:19.722 --> 01:21.064
As natural as culs-de-sac.

01:23.842 --> 01:25.979
Hey, when did Lane start working here?

01:26.240 --> 01:27.368
Oh, a couple of days ago.

01:27.577 --> 01:30.766
She filled out an application, and Luke brought her in for an interview and everything.

01:30.893 --> 01:32.225
An interview? So official.

01:32.542 --> 01:36.622
Yeah. They sat in complete silence for a full five minutes,

01:36.762 --> 01:38.414
then Luke said, "How ya doing?"

01:38.595 --> 01:40.469
and she said "Good," and then he gave her the job.

01:40.627 --> 01:41.728
So what do we get out of this?

01:41.913 --> 01:42.640
What do you mean?

01:42.757 --> 01:44.560
We got someone on the inside now, a friend of ours.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.773
And out of it we could get?

01:45.907 --> 01:47.063
The secret things he keeps back there.

01:47.181 --> 01:48.149
His showgirl costume.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.991
Extra jelly packets, butter, discarded day-old bread.

01:51.201 --> 01:52.854
But we get that when we go dumpster driving.

01:52.952 --> 01:54.016
This'll be easier on our shoes.

01:54.139 --> 01:55.429
- Hey, Luke. 
- Look at this.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.104
Who, Lane? She's super waitress,

01:57.232 --> 01:59.633
able to leap tall pancakes in a single bound.

01:59.797 --> 02:01.261
- Or is that pans-cake? 
- Very funny.

02:01.404 --> 02:02.336
It's not gonna work out.

02:02.502 --> 02:03.975
Oh. What, she's so good.

02:04.118 --> 02:05.829
-She's too good. 
- Oh, calm down.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.175
I'm not even sure why she took the job. I mean, I totally blew the interview.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.333
You were nervous.

02:10.493 --> 02:12.012
Hey, guys. You got this, Luke?

02:12.141 --> 02:12.817
Yeah, I got it.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.830
Caesar, I need that English muffin.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.675
When there was a lull, she cleaned the menus without being asked.

02:18.854 --> 02:20.359
- Do you mean mens-u? 
- Stop it.

02:20.481 --> 02:22.279
This isn't challenging enough. She's gonna get bored.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.148
- Buy her a chemistry set. 
- Or a foosball table.

02:24.317 --> 02:25.463
I should find something to do.

02:25.715 --> 02:27.077
Having help is stressing him.

02:27.204 --> 02:29.201
So, now, why do you have to get back to campus so early?

02:29.407 --> 02:30.784
Classes don't start for a couple of days.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.559
Yeah, I have a lot of stuff to do.

02:32.683 --> 02:34.224
And it'll be nice and quiet with no roommates around.

02:34.393 --> 02:35.493
Where are the rooms-mate?

02:35.648 --> 02:37.870
Janet's mountain climbing, Tanna's home,

02:37.955 --> 02:39.754
and Paris went skiing with her boyfriend.

02:39.872 --> 02:41.684
So you're just ignoring the plural thing now?

02:41.992 --> 02:44.925
You haven't mentioned Paris' boyfriend in awhile. Everything good there?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.869
What? Something's not right?

02:48.283 --> 02:52.185
Just the weirdness of them being really busy with school,

02:52.313 --> 02:54.811
and he's miles away at Princeton, but they're good.

02:55.082 --> 02:58.027
She called me from the slopes and they sounded like they were having a blast.

02:58.155 --> 02:59.045
Eggs scrambled, Caesar.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.175
- Luke, coffee in the corner. 
- Right, sorry.

03:01.458 --> 03:04.089
Boy, maybe this Lane/Luke team isn't gonna work out.

03:05.147 --> 03:06.690
Where do you think Luke will go?

03:06.896 --> 03:09.450
I don't know. Maybe a big chain will take him on.

03:09.568 --> 03:11.298
I wonder if he has a forklift license.

03:11.437 --> 03:12.809
He could redeem recyclables.

03:13.034 --> 03:14.268
You mean recycs-able?

04:10.056 --> 04:11.003
You promise?

04:11.075 --> 04:13.645
Yes. This is in and out, pick a molding for the public areas,

04:13.723 --> 04:15.315
- meeting adjourned. 
- No food sampling.

04:15.677 --> 04:16.676
It's not on the agenda.

04:16.788 --> 04:18.411
I have not seen Sookie once this month

04:18.483 --> 04:21.002
where she has not greeted me by shoving something in my mouth.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.393
Are you sure it was food every time?

04:22.493 --> 04:25.917
You can joke, but as long as super low rise jeans are in fashion for men,

04:26.077 --> 04:27.710
I must stay trim or I'll die.

04:31.135 --> 04:31.918
Come on in!

04:32.185 --> 04:34.320
- How low we talking here? 
- I've had to wax.

04:34.786 --> 04:35.630
Subject over.

04:40.757 --> 04:42.400
Ooh, this is nice.

04:42.507 --> 04:44.211
That's my favorite, too. A little pricey.

04:44.498 --> 04:46.486
It's amazing how we always pick the pricey.

04:46.607 --> 04:48.711
- So, do you guys want something to... 
- No!

04:48.815 --> 04:51.174
- ... drink? I made hot water for tea. 
- Tea?

04:51.288 --> 04:52.573
You like Earl Gray, right?

04:52.870 --> 04:53.811
If you have some.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.413
It's all ready. Earl Gray.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.412
Thank you.

04:57.723 --> 04:59.219
- And try this pizzelle. 
- I knew it.

04:59.321 --> 05:00.771
- Delight! 
- This is a tasting.

05:00.882 --> 05:02.178
I just need your opinion.

05:02.307 --> 05:04.935
My opinion is you're trying to fatten me out of a love life.

05:05.046 --> 05:06.936
- I thought you were celibate. 
- Not by choice.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.161
You woke up Davey, big mouth.

05:10.274 --> 05:11.419
Do you wanna go check on him?

05:11.518 --> 05:12.516
He'll be out here in a second.

05:12.654 --> 05:15.081
He's two months and already walking? I'm missing the big moments.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.929
- Tobin! 
- Tobin?

05:17.405 --> 05:20.395
Hi, and I'm high around this little thing.

05:20.759 --> 05:22.070
He's such an angel.

05:22.663 --> 05:26.561
Hello, little booby. Did that mean old Michel wake you up?

05:26.739 --> 05:28.695
I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.985
Isn't this great? We have the whole team back together.

05:31.091 --> 05:33.262
I'm ecstatic. Did you know about this?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.914
I knew that Tobin was back in town, but I didn't hear you were the...

05:36.012 --> 05:38.408
Davey's nanny? Just until something permanent comes along.

05:38.577 --> 05:41.476
Davey fell for this guy lock, stock and barrel.

05:41.593 --> 05:42.903
It was love at first sight.

05:43.232 --> 05:46.528
My whole life is kids. I have eleven nieces and nephews.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.883
How joyous for you.

05:49.020 --> 05:50.501
Now, Tobin, we'd heard you moved.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.392
Yes, right after the inn burned down.

05:52.590 --> 05:54.420
I moved to Utah because I heard there was

05:54.523 --> 05:56.886
lots of job opportunities for industrious Mormons.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.217
I didn't know you were a Mormon.

05:58.356 --> 06:01.253
I wasn't, so I became one. The paperwork took weeks.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.486
And I didn't know about the alcohol thing.

06:03.634 --> 06:05.954
- They famously abstain. 
- No coffee either.

06:06.128 --> 06:10.168
The choir is fabulous, but then there's the funny underwear. It didn't last.

06:10.281 --> 06:12.099
Then he called me from the road and suggested this.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.419
How wonderful.

06:13.628 --> 06:15.068
Oh, I see you're trying the pizzelles.

06:15.590 --> 06:18.294
Are they not pieces of heaven shaped like cookies?

06:18.437 --> 06:19.414
Wonderful.

06:19.548 --> 06:22.318
You know, they'd be perfect for breakfast, too, with cappuccino.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.857
I've never thought of them for breakfast. Great idea.

06:25.005 --> 06:26.091
It occurred to me.

06:26.234 --> 06:28.687
You know, you could serve them on that green platter we bought yesterday.

06:28.815 --> 06:30.433
The colors would juxtapose nicely.

06:30.536 --> 06:31.739
You went shopping together?

06:31.862 --> 06:35.328
Yes. I turned Sookie onto a place that sells hard-to-find kitchenware.

06:35.451 --> 06:38.461
Oh, and I found some websites I'd like to recommend to you, Lorelai.

06:38.593 --> 06:41.175
I spent a lot of time online when I was a Mormon.

06:41.365 --> 06:42.338
There wasn't much else to do.

06:42.475 --> 06:46.370
Excuse me, is this not an inn meeting for inn employees only?

06:47.083 --> 06:48.353
It's okay, little baby.

06:48.732 --> 06:51.220
I think your voice hits a pitch that hurts his ears.

06:51.338 --> 06:53.898
My voice has the same pitch as anyone else's.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.841
- Michel hates babies. 
- I do not hate babies.

06:56.954 --> 06:58.527
- Well, babies hate you. 
- They do not hate me.

06:58.659 --> 07:01.250
Look, all I'm saying is, we have limited time together,

07:01.331 --> 07:03.927
the three of us, and we cannot afford to waste it,

07:04.046 --> 07:05.541
the three of us, and he's cutting in.

07:05.678 --> 07:07.276
Michel, I'm not cutting in.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.073
But the fact is, wherever Sookie goes, the baby goes,

07:10.268 --> 07:13.175
and wherever the baby goes, I go. It's my job.

07:13.286 --> 07:16.032
We even made a joke earlier - the baby has a meeting today.

07:18.818 --> 07:21.603
- I love this. 
- We do, too.

07:21.721 --> 07:23.328
Would you like a cup of tea, Tobin?

07:23.589 --> 07:25.448
Just a little lapsing oolong, please.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.449
- You knew that? 
- Yes, I did.

07:31.557 --> 07:33.261
- Come on! 
- Everyone does.

07:33.517 --> 07:35.218
- Did you? 
- Of course I did.

07:35.346 --> 07:37.547
So everyone in the entire world knew the plural

07:37.629 --> 07:39.207
of cul-de-sac was culs-de-sac?

07:39.401 --> 07:40.641
- Yes. 
- Okay.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.698
So Mariah Carey is out with some friends

07:42.842 --> 07:45.894
and she's had a couple cocktails, she glances down from the roof

07:46.010 --> 07:49.094
and says, "Oh, look at all those culs-de-sac."

07:49.227 --> 07:50.225
Why are they on the roof?

07:50.409 --> 07:51.192
It's a rooftop bar.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.206
How have you been saying it?

07:52.324 --> 07:53.189
Cul-de-sacs.

07:53.291 --> 07:54.540
And no one ever corrected you?

07:54.668 --> 07:56.410
No, because that's the way it should be.

07:56.548 --> 07:58.725
Even if it isn't technically correct,

07:58.821 --> 08:01.704
- it should be pronounced that way. 
- Mom, Mom, just let it go.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.850
- I will never let this go. 
- Is there dessert?

08:03.987 --> 08:06.424
Yes, and we have a special surprise for you for dessert.

08:06.491 --> 08:07.551
We brought it back from Switzerland.

08:07.618 --> 08:08.698
We're getting a mountain goat?

08:08.805 --> 08:09.629
This is better than a goat.

08:09.732 --> 08:10.664
Let's go into the living room.

08:10.792 --> 08:11.950
Dessert from Switzerland.

08:12.103 --> 08:13.199
The land of chocolate.

08:13.286 --> 08:15.513
You two are going to love this.

08:15.616 --> 08:16.738
Is it as good as Toblerone?

08:16.885 --> 08:18.489
Oh, it's better than Toblerone.

08:19.906 --> 08:22.358
Whoa, what is that?

08:22.579 --> 08:23.663
It's marzipan.

08:23.982 --> 08:24.734
Marzipan?

08:25.636 --> 08:28.630
The finest marzipan in all of Europe.

08:28.897 --> 08:30.464
Made by cloistered nuns.

08:30.571 --> 08:33.177
We toured their cloister, it was right out of "The Sound of Music."

08:33.326 --> 08:34.344
What happened to the chocolate?

08:34.467 --> 08:35.073
What chocolate?

08:35.195 --> 08:36.981
You compared it to Toblerone - that's chocolate.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.352
You brought up Toblerone.

08:38.522 --> 08:40.626
I just said it was better than that because I think it is.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.609
Marzipan is candy. You like candy.

08:42.725 --> 08:43.918
Marzipan is not candy.

08:44.053 --> 08:47.887
It is a unique substance unto itself, like Velveeta or plutonium.

08:48.015 --> 08:49.074
You're not even going to try it?

08:49.188 --> 08:50.729
- I'll pass. 
- I'll try some, Grandma.

08:50.888 --> 08:53.009
- Take the one with the little pig on it. 
- Oh, thank you.

08:53.269 --> 08:56.321
We got the pigs for you and the bunny for your mother.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.379
You got me bunnies?

08:58.588 --> 08:59.843
They're for whomever now.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.464
Well, no, I'll try a bunny.

09:01.614 --> 09:02.675
Don't force yourself.

09:02.828 --> 09:04.578
I'm not. I want a bunny. Give me a bunny.

09:05.915 --> 09:06.842
Delicious.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.913
Those nuns kick you-know-what.

09:11.128 --> 09:13.263
- Now who can that be? 
- Ah, it's probably Jason.

09:13.396 --> 09:15.664
He said he might drop something by on his way back from the airport.

09:15.910 --> 09:18.045
- In the middle of dinner? 
- He won't be here long.

09:18.132 --> 09:20.534
He's probably exhausted. The flight from Australia is draining.

09:20.657 --> 09:22.044
Jason, welcome back.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.917
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your evening.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.243
Oh, oh, not at all. You look fit.

09:26.477 --> 09:28.663
- Look how fit he looks, Emily. 
- He looks very fit.

09:28.771 --> 09:30.184
- Hello, Jason. 
- Emily.

09:30.707 --> 09:32.023
You've met Lorelai and Rory.

09:32.232 --> 09:33.728
Yes, it's nice to see you again.

09:33.952 --> 09:34.665
Same here.

09:35.248 --> 09:38.209
Richard, here are the papers, and they do not need to be notarized.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.793
Oh, that's a huge help. Terrific.

09:40.943 --> 09:42.795
So, Mom, maybe our guest would...

09:42.985 --> 09:44.783
Oh, Jason, would you like some marzipan?

09:45.812 --> 09:48.157
Would I? I love marzipan.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.629
Take as much as you like, and put some extra into a napkin.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.434
Just not the one Lorelai spat her piece into.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.735
Mmm, delicious.

10:00.106 --> 10:02.558
I'll be going. It was good to see you all again.

10:02.747 --> 10:03.373
Oh, here.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.318
No, no, no, no, Richard, you don't have to see me out.

10:05.413 --> 10:06.266
All right. See you tomorrow.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.224
He must have been hiking the whole time. He looks wonderful.

10:10.869 --> 10:14.043
Excuse me, I just have to freshen up my... be right back.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.660
Have you swallowed your marzipan yet?

10:28.185 --> 10:28.979
Hello?

10:29.984 --> 10:31.166
So, you're back.

10:31.391 --> 10:33.480
I am no hologram.

10:35.611 --> 10:36.700
Australia was good?

10:36.769 --> 10:38.278
Very good. Hot.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.800
You tie your wallaby down, sport?

10:41.787 --> 10:44.415
No, I just drank a lot of beer

10:44.549 --> 10:46.731
and thought about you a lot.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.626
That's very sweet.

10:47.852 --> 10:49.039
So when are we getting together again?

10:49.213 --> 10:50.488
- When do you want? 
- How about now?

10:50.775 --> 10:51.733
Too spontaneous.

10:51.850 --> 10:52.895
How about Monday night?

10:53.007 --> 10:54.569
- For what? 
- Dinner, et cetera.

10:54.641 --> 10:56.387
- Sounds good, et cetera. 
- I'll call you.

10:56.494 --> 10:58.430
Okay. Hey, what are you gonna do with your marzipan?

10:58.533 --> 11:01.738
Oh, I don't know. I thought I'd dump 'em on the road,

11:01.821 --> 11:03.299
but is that environmentally sound?

11:03.407 --> 11:04.692
I don't think marzipan biodegrades.

11:04.774 --> 11:06.545
I'll just serve it to the clients I don't like.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.929
- Well, bye. 
- I'll see you Monday.

11:11.727 --> 11:13.350
Almost done with your radiator, young lady.

11:13.466 --> 11:14.292
Take your time.

11:14.665 --> 11:17.006
You were smart. You come back early, you beat the rush.

11:17.263 --> 11:18.878
I just wanted to get a jump on things.

11:19.253 --> 11:21.275
I like the campus when it's kind of empty like this,

11:21.373 --> 11:24.255
you know, all quiet. Snow's pretty, too.

11:24.619 --> 11:25.669
Yeah, very pretty.

11:26.211 --> 11:28.368
There's something very magical about this campus.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.637
I've been here 23 years come August and I've never been bored.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.895
You know, we've had presidents graduate from this school.

11:35.116 --> 11:36.324
- You okay? 
- What?

11:36.559 --> 11:37.411
You feeling okay?

11:37.751 --> 11:39.186
Yes. I...

11:40.052 --> 11:41.265
Yes. Thanks.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.090
- Rory. 
- Paris, hi.

11:47.209 --> 11:48.862
- You're back early. 
- You're back early.

11:49.047 --> 11:51.244
Just thought I'd get a jump on things. How was your trip?

11:51.469 --> 11:52.952
Great. I thought I'd come back early.

11:53.077 --> 11:54.439
Same here. Where's your stuff?

11:54.603 --> 11:56.138
- I got back early. 
- I know.

11:56.348 --> 11:59.015
Early this morning, so I unpacked and then I went to visit my mom.

11:59.168 --> 12:00.458
- Is she good? 
- She wasn't there.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.954
- Jamie says hello. 
- Oh, good. Hello back at him.

12:03.310 --> 12:05.896
- So, you guys have fun? 
- I told you that on the phone.

12:06.118 --> 12:07.391
I know. You have fun after that?

12:07.531 --> 12:09.000
Sure. The resort was beautiful.

12:09.137 --> 12:12.286
A little too star-studded. Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart were there.

12:12.410 --> 12:14.303
- They tongue kissed in public. 
- They're in love.

12:14.407 --> 12:16.783
Then she'd tickle his tummy and he'd giggle. It was foul.

12:17.212 --> 12:18.088
To each his own.

12:18.477 --> 12:19.537
I'll get out of your way.

12:19.670 --> 12:20.852
You're not in my way. I'll get out of your way.

12:20.991 --> 12:21.722
You're not in my way.

12:21.826 --> 12:22.721
I'll just stay here, then.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.423
Good.

12:37.177 --> 12:38.199
End scene.

12:39.034 --> 12:39.592
Shoot.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.810
- What are you doing? 
- Oh, God!

12:56.929 --> 12:58.464
Rory! Announce yourself!

12:58.573 --> 12:59.862
Were you brushing dirt under the sink?

12:59.944 --> 13:02.289
No, I am brushing crumbs under the sink.

13:02.391 --> 13:03.149
You're a pig.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.458
You're just learning that? Why are you here anyway?

13:05.644 --> 13:06.949
Oh, crabby and dirty.

13:07.071 --> 13:10.798
I thought you were going to hang at school for some alone time.

13:10.906 --> 13:12.447
Alone time suddenly included Paris.

13:12.579 --> 13:14.788
Oh. I thought Paris was skiing with Jamie.

13:14.925 --> 13:17.777
Paris is definitely not skiing, and Paris is definitely not with Jamie.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.031
Hm, meaning?

13:19.216 --> 13:21.490
There are little marshmallow Easter bunnies under here.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.531
No, no, what did you mean when you said Paris was not with Jamie?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.010
Paris is seeing somebody else.

13:26.241 --> 13:27.567
Really? A psychiatrist?

13:27.710 --> 13:28.538
A professor.

13:28.703 --> 13:30.019
- At Yale? 
- Yes.

13:31.498 --> 13:33.807
Lorelai Gilmore, you've been holding out on me.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.951
It's so weird. One minute, she's totally in love with Jamie

13:37.074 --> 13:40.126
and then the next, she's making out with a professor in a dark corner.

13:40.259 --> 13:41.145
You saw them making out?

13:41.293 --> 13:43.173
Apparently, the big game was big for everyone.

13:43.331 --> 13:46.603
Wow. I can't believe Paris is doing an older man.

13:46.731 --> 13:48.073
Who said doing? I didn't say doing.

13:48.155 --> 13:49.501
I just said kissing, that's it.

13:49.617 --> 13:52.194
Rory, come on. When you're dating an older man,

13:52.317 --> 13:54.806
- you're probably doing older-man things. 
- Oh, geez.

13:54.913 --> 13:56.848
So what age are we talking here, like 35, 40?

13:58.017 --> 14:01.999
- 45? 46? 47? 47½? 48? 
- Sixty!

14:02.101 --> 14:04.951
- What?! Shut up! 
- He went to school with Grandpa.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.975
- Sixty? 
- That's how they met.

14:07.175 --> 14:09.710
We were having lunch, he came by, Grandpa introduced them.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.454
She wanted to get an interview, and apparently, she got one.

14:12.582 --> 14:14.794
- Sixty? Like sixty-sixty? 
- Mom.

14:14.932 --> 14:16.120
I'm sorry, it's just...

14:16.216 --> 14:18.245
Now I know who Woody Allen's next leading lady's gonna be.

14:18.388 --> 14:20.795
And it's so annoying. I mean, she's hiding it from me,

14:20.887 --> 14:23.068
so I'm not supposed to know. I'm supposed to think that she's still with Jamie,

14:23.181 --> 14:24.722
- which she's not. 
- Are you sure?

14:25.009 --> 14:26.201
- No. 
- Intrigue.

14:26.309 --> 14:28.199
I don't like intrigue, I don't want intrigue.

14:28.347 --> 14:31.608
I like Jamie. He's a nice guy. He's a patient guy.

14:31.731 --> 14:33.635
I mean, Paris should not be treating him like this.

14:33.774 --> 14:36.415
Oh, honey, if she likes another guy, there's nothing you can do about it.

14:36.559 --> 14:37.951
Let us all remember Dean.

14:38.130 --> 14:41.106
This is not the same as Dean. I did not cheat on Dean with an old guy.

14:41.259 --> 14:42.186
Is the old guy married?

14:42.351 --> 14:44.638
He was. He has kids, grown kids. He's a writer.

14:44.752 --> 14:46.368
Well, what would the school say if they knew about this?

14:46.518 --> 14:49.099
Yes, what about that? This guy's risking everything -

14:49.236 --> 14:51.417
- his job, his reputation. 
- Yes, well...

14:51.632 --> 14:52.934
he'll always have Paris.

14:53.231 --> 14:54.813
How long have you been waiting with that one?

14:54.946 --> 14:57.218
I just had a feeling the opportunity would present itself eventually.

14:57.382 --> 14:58.784
Maybe it's a phase. It'll pass.

14:58.953 --> 15:00.726
Oh, yeah, or he will.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.635
Hello?

15:04.766 --> 15:06.742
What? Michel?

15:07.049 --> 15:10.495
Calm down. I can't understand you when you're not screaming hysterically.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.208
Okay, what are you...

15:13.428 --> 15:16.533
Okay! Okay, I'll be right there. Goodbye.

15:16.890 --> 15:18.712
- I gotta go. 
- Why? What's up?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.316
- Michel's spazzing. 
- Why?

15:20.463 --> 15:22.260
I don't know. Will you be here when I get back?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.122
If you don't mind. Paris was getting out her potter's wheel as I was leaving.

15:25.286 --> 15:27.412
Okay, I'll go pick up Chinese.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.835
Or we can just eat what's under the sink.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.421
- Ah, the wit. 
- Get egg rolls.

15:30.907 --> 15:33.464
All right, just watch out - old guys don't like 'em bossy.

15:33.771 --> 15:37.212
You took so long! Why? You need to charter an airplane?

15:37.334 --> 15:38.558
I came as quickly as I - ow!

15:38.686 --> 15:39.946
- Get in here. 
- What is going on?

15:40.171 --> 15:42.085
- Move quicker, please. 
- Is Sookie here?

15:42.285 --> 15:44.150
She and the farmer went to see a movie.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.316
Do they know you're here?

15:45.658 --> 15:46.783
Yes, they do.

15:46.993 --> 15:49.142
- And they're okay with that? 
- This way, please.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.326
Stop. What's going on? Why are we in the bedroom?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.656
- I offered to babysit. 
- I'm sorry, you did what?

15:54.810 --> 15:57.504
I heard Sookie talking to the potato man about wanting to go out,

15:57.604 --> 16:00.273
and there was no one to watch the baby, so I offered to watch it for her.

16:00.389 --> 16:01.978
- It? 
- Him. Watch him for her.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.862
- And she let you? 
- Yes, she let me.

16:03.985 --> 16:07.209
So I came over, and the minute that she left, it started to cry.

16:07.328 --> 16:08.460
- It? 
- Him, he started to cry.

16:08.617 --> 16:11.168
He wouldn't stop. I did everything. I did the jiggle and the bouncy

16:11.240 --> 16:12.935
and the airplane, and then I even picked it up.

16:13.043 --> 16:14.266
- It? 
- Him, dammit, him!

16:14.383 --> 16:17.076
I picked him up, but it didn't matter. He wouldn't stop crying.

16:17.190 --> 16:18.772
So finally I invented a game.

16:18.941 --> 16:20.902
- What kind of game? 
- I called it baby crepe.

16:21.039 --> 16:23.303
- I don't think I know that one. 
- Well, it's quite ingenious.

16:23.450 --> 16:27.568
You get down here on the floor and then you roll him up in a blanket

16:27.712 --> 16:30.328
and then you pull it back and forth and back and forth.

16:30.599 --> 16:34.516
He loved it. He did not cry, he smiled, he giggled.

16:34.655 --> 16:37.148
He was having the time of his life. And then...

16:37.316 --> 16:39.748
- Oh no. 
- I pulled back the blanket a little too hard.

16:39.829 --> 16:41.520
- What? 
- And he rolled under the bed.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.958
- What? 
- And he got stuck.

16:43.113 --> 16:44.182
Oh! Oh my God!

16:44.321 --> 16:46.475
I tried to get him out, but I couldn't get him to grab the string,

16:46.577 --> 16:48.688
and then he fell asleep, and I worried if I woke him up,

16:48.831 --> 16:50.127
the screaming would start again.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.389
I can't believe you rolled little Davey under the bed.

16:52.515 --> 16:54.423
- Davey? 
- Yes, Davey, Sookie's baby.

16:54.539 --> 16:56.097
Is that his name? I've been calling him Truman.

16:56.199 --> 16:57.735
- Why? 
- I thought that's what his name was.

16:57.843 --> 16:58.753
Where'd you get Truman from?

16:58.897 --> 17:00.110
I don't know, I heard it wrong, okay?

17:00.203 --> 17:01.309
Do you think he's gonna hold this against me?

17:01.483 --> 17:03.827
What, the man that rolled him under the bed? No, I think you're good.

17:04.950 --> 17:06.988
Oh, man, he really is sleeping. He looks so peaceful.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.518
See? I made him happy.

17:08.816 --> 17:10.357
We need to lift this bed and get him up.

17:12.306 --> 17:13.781
- What are you doing? 
- Taking off my shirt.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.161
What part of "lift the bed and get him out" translates to

17:16.252 --> 17:17.954
- you taking off your shirt? 
- This is an expensive shirt.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.448
No, no, no. I'm not lifting the bed with a naked you.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.906
I wasn't going to take off my pants.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.653
- Leave the shirt on. 
- It will wrinkle.

17:23.858 --> 17:25.946
Not as much as it will if Sookie comes home and finds Truman

17:26.050 --> 17:29.183
under the bed. Now, Lift up here, and I'll get him out.

17:29.638 --> 17:31.875
I can't hold this by myself. Are you crazy?

17:32.014 --> 17:33.333
Okay, you hold that. Are you ready?

17:33.349 --> 17:34.103
No!

17:34.789 --> 17:37.744
Hey. Hey, Davey. I gotcha.

17:40.749 --> 17:44.046
- You're snoozy, huh? Yeah. 
- How is he?

17:44.163 --> 17:47.169
He's just fine. He's just fine.

17:47.748 --> 17:48.982
There you go.

17:49.244 --> 17:51.435
Just kick back, wait 'til Mommy gets home.

17:53.585 --> 17:55.561
Now please tell me what is going on here.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.727
- Nothing. 
- Why are you babysitting?

17:57.880 --> 17:58.936
- I... 
- You hate babies.

17:59.095 --> 18:00.400
Not really.

18:00.508 --> 18:01.961
You do not babysit ever.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.506
And yet here you are wearing your super-low-cut jeans

18:04.609 --> 18:06.206
making up baby games, and I want to know why.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.909
I hate Tobin! He's a sniveling little sycophantic tushie kisser,

18:10.005 --> 18:11.214
- and I hate him! 
- Michel!

18:11.345 --> 18:14.552
He weasels his way into every area of my life.

18:14.696 --> 18:16.855
The only good thing about the Independence Inn burning down

18:16.953 --> 18:19.626
was that Tobin was gone, but yet, here he is, back.

18:19.698 --> 18:20.731
- He's like the cat. 
- What cat?

18:20.932 --> 18:22.754
The one that came back the very next day.

18:22.898 --> 18:24.843
You thought he was a goner, but the cat came back.

18:24.925 --> 18:26.113
He just wouldn't stay away.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.366
Michel, you do not have to be jealous of Tobin.

18:28.515 --> 18:30.260
He wants to replace me.

18:30.353 --> 18:31.843
- As what? 
- As everything.

18:31.949 --> 18:33.669
He wants to replace me in my entire life.

18:33.783 --> 18:37.132
He's going to keep worming his way in until you no longer find any reason

18:37.202 --> 18:38.893
- to have me around. 
- You're being silly.

18:39.005 --> 18:40.352
He's going to succeed.

18:40.582 --> 18:44.105
It doesn't matter that I have all the experience and the credentials and the history

18:44.247 --> 18:47.084
to run this inn. He likes the baby. He holds the baby.

18:47.177 --> 18:49.258
He doesn't roll the baby under the bed - he wins!

18:49.635 --> 18:51.370
Oh, he does not win.

18:51.775 --> 18:53.716
Michel, this rivalry is in your head.

18:54.197 --> 18:55.563
- It is, huh? 
- Yes.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.970
So you do not like Tobin better than me?

18:58.169 --> 19:00.320
No. We like Tobin.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.112
We're addicted to you.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.299
- You are? 
- Yes.

19:03.413 --> 19:06.244
We asked you to come with us to the Dragonfly, didn't we?

19:06.526 --> 19:10.156
We love you, Michel, and as long as you stay far, far away from little Davey,

19:10.253 --> 19:11.323
we will continue loving you.

19:13.093 --> 19:15.261
- I can do that. 
- Good.

19:16.311 --> 19:19.695
Okay, hold on.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.603
And... what do you think?

19:23.340 --> 19:24.333
It stinks.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.277
Well, it's a newspaper hat. It's not supposed to spark a trend.

19:29.885 --> 19:30.699
There.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.001
- How'd you do that? 
- Martha Stewart.

19:33.212 --> 19:34.823
Martha Stewart actually did a segment on

19:34.926 --> 19:36.386
how to make a hat out of newspaper?

19:36.534 --> 19:38.896
- Yes. 
- Oh. Well, it looks nice.

19:39.187 --> 19:42.961
Aah! What is this? Academically approved torture?

19:43.139 --> 19:45.146
Make your own hat - that's how you get on the paper?

19:45.229 --> 19:47.148
'Cause that has what to do with anything?

19:47.250 --> 19:48.664
- Relax, Glenn. 
- It's tradition.

19:48.823 --> 19:50.916
It's not tradition. It's hazing.

19:51.117 --> 19:54.869
Why don't they just handcuff us naked to a streetlamp wearing a sign

19:54.946 --> 19:57.891
that says, "honk if you like unbiased journalism"?

19:58.013 --> 19:59.334
I'm not doing it. They can't make me.

19:59.436 --> 20:01.193
You don't wear the hat, you're not getting on the paper.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.026
I need another sheet.

20:03.496 --> 20:04.700
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:04.951 --> 20:07.696
tonight represents a melding of the old and the new.

20:07.823 --> 20:10.527
For one night, identifying the two groups will be easy.

20:10.788 --> 20:12.841
The old will be the ones running around frantically

20:12.939 --> 20:14.947
trying to get out the latest issue of the Daily News,

20:15.088 --> 20:17.087
and the new will be the ones in the stupid hats.

20:17.235 --> 20:20.741
It's a much-beloved tradition that for one night, all night,

20:20.941 --> 20:24.085
you don a hat of your own making, wait on members of the paper

20:24.269 --> 20:27.213
while observing the inner working of the Yale Daily News.

20:27.987 --> 20:30.480
There's a lot of new, fresh talent sitting in this room tonight.

20:31.089 --> 20:34.940
Rory Gilmore, an unflinchingly honest reviewer who shows no mercy,

20:35.006 --> 20:36.991
but a great deal of dark wit in her pieces.

20:37.248 --> 20:40.376
Paris Geller, whose interview with Professor Asher Fleming

20:40.480 --> 20:42.824
was the most intimate and revealing portrait of a complicated man

20:42.906 --> 20:44.053
that I have ever read.

20:44.724 --> 20:48.267
Glenn Babble, whose cartoon commentaries on the American family

20:48.360 --> 20:50.910
prove that he was never hugged a day in his life.

20:52.092 --> 20:54.616
It's hard work being here, but it's an honor.

20:55.030 --> 20:57.207
You're working with the best of the best.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.977
From here, you can go to the New York Times, the Washington Post.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.921
You can even sell out your ideals completely like the cofounders

21:02.983 --> 21:05.116
of the Daily News did when they started Time magazine,

21:05.277 --> 21:08.604
which has basically become an overhyped, illustrated birdcage liner.

21:08.858 --> 21:11.817
News for the "Reader's Digest" bunch, I call it.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.531
The "just give us the gist of it" magazine masquerading as a real news outlet.

21:15.726 --> 21:18.720
I mean, let's face it - if it weren't for waiting rooms all over the world,

21:18.844 --> 21:21.973
there'd be absolutely no need for Time magazine... at all.

21:22.171 --> 21:24.409
I hate Time magazine! Cheryl, I need tea!

21:26.079 --> 21:28.106
You know, you never told me what you thought of my article.

21:28.352 --> 21:30.174
What article?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.289
My interview with Asher Fleming. Did you read it?

21:32.402 --> 21:33.180
I skimmed it.

21:33.380 --> 21:36.007
I have a copy in our room. I can give it to you tomorrow.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.573
You're a good writer. I'm sure it's good.

21:37.845 --> 21:39.498
Yeah, but still, I'd like you to read it.

21:39.775 --> 21:42.351
I trust your opinion, and I'd like to be able to discuss it with you.

21:42.611 --> 21:45.197
Look, we're supposed to be taking dinner orders, so...

21:47.154 --> 21:48.365
Hello?

21:49.749 --> 21:51.894
No phone calls while you're wearing the hat!

21:52.596 --> 21:53.333
Hold on.

21:54.254 --> 21:56.027
- I will be right back. 
- Where are you going?

21:57.469 --> 21:59.145
You're not supposed to leave while you're wearing the hat.

21:59.513 --> 22:00.365
I will be right back.

22:02.974 --> 22:06.394
It's a good thing high school had already beaten all the self-esteem out of me.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.062
How could you talk through an entire movie?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.167
Well, nothing else was happening.

22:14.356 --> 22:15.897
An entire movie was happening.

22:16.031 --> 22:18.724
There were people in costumes and horses.

22:18.811 --> 22:20.259
- Did you see the horses? 
- I did see the horses.

22:20.347 --> 22:21.262
I thought you liked horses.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.464
I do like horses, but they never let them talk.

22:23.679 --> 22:25.855
That's because this wasn't a talking-horse movie.

22:26.085 --> 22:27.919
- You want some wine? 
- Oh, I don't know.

22:28.036 --> 22:31.324
- You're vibing my movie-watching habits. 
- I am not vibing your habits.

22:31.432 --> 22:34.288
I'm merely saying that the large man in a wife beater

22:34.421 --> 22:37.114
sitting in front of us invited me into the lobby to discuss your habits,

22:37.217 --> 22:40.038
and had I accepted his charming invitation,

22:40.258 --> 22:42.864
- I might be in traction right now. 
- Oh, please.

22:42.989 --> 22:45.277
You could totally have outrun him. You're spry.

22:45.472 --> 22:46.173
Thank you.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.331
So, this is your place.

22:50.615 --> 22:51.500
This is it.

22:52.075 --> 22:53.796
Interesting. Very, very interesting.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.305
So, what's the verdict?

22:56.914 --> 22:58.512
You're not a tchotchke guy.

22:59.095 --> 23:02.895
Yeah, I don't like too many objects around that have no obvious purpose.

23:03.176 --> 23:05.556
The purpose of tchotchkes is to make you happy.

23:05.982 --> 23:07.144
They make you smile.

23:07.543 --> 23:09.340
They make a room seem fun and whimsical.

23:09.697 --> 23:13.063
I invite a clown over once a week to make the room feel fun and whimsical,

23:13.191 --> 23:14.787
so I feel all set in that department.

23:14.962 --> 23:16.421
- I thought you said you had a dog. 
- I do.

23:16.616 --> 23:17.763
- Where is he? 
- Over there.

23:19.483 --> 23:23.123
Oh. He's cute... and very still.

23:23.246 --> 23:24.517
Yeah, he's the best.

23:24.680 --> 23:25.842
- What is his name? 
- Cyrus.

23:26.451 --> 23:28.321
Cyrus, sure. Perfect name for a dog.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.657
Cyrus. Hi, Cyrus.

23:30.446 --> 23:31.418
Is he breathing?

23:33.619 --> 23:36.253
Cyrus was actually trained by the monks of New Skete.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.507
He's incredibly well-behaved. He was housebroken in an hour.

23:40.634 --> 23:44.018
He has a two-bark minimum for delivery guys, three for everybody else,

23:44.122 --> 23:46.634
but the best thing about him is he doesn't do any of the standard

23:46.716 --> 23:49.734
"sit and lie down" commands. I taught him very special commands

23:49.805 --> 23:51.777
- that only my dog could know. 
- Like what?

23:52.078 --> 23:55.473
Like... a little to the left.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.209
Shut up.

23:56.378 --> 23:58.411
Cyrus, a little to the left.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.467
What the hell's that good for?

24:02.569 --> 24:04.637
Well, what the hell is "sit" good for?

24:04.731 --> 24:05.920
When you sit, you get a cookie.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.611
When you move a little to the left,

24:08.735 --> 24:10.654
you get the satisfaction of knowing you are doing something,

24:10.740 --> 24:12.508
but you are not pandering for a dog bone.

24:12.630 --> 24:13.732
Can he move a little to the right?

24:13.885 --> 24:16.859
No, not yet. We just do a little to the left until he hits the wall,

24:16.915 --> 24:17.960
and then I turn him around.

24:18.969 --> 24:20.940
You and your dog are extremely weird.

24:21.118 --> 24:21.862
Thank you.

24:27.550 --> 24:28.334
Thank you.

24:34.539 --> 24:37.247
I'm not sure we're setting such a good example for Cyrus over there.

24:37.883 --> 24:40.028
Oh, you might be right.

24:40.550 --> 24:41.681
Cyrus...

24:45.358 --> 24:46.212
Okay.

24:47.211 --> 24:48.296
That one, I get.

24:54.098 --> 24:55.470
Every week, you argue with me.

24:55.572 --> 24:56.893
But Doyle, it's a perfectly good article.

24:57.021 --> 24:58.599
We don't do "perfectly good" here.

24:58.879 --> 25:00.851
You want to do "perfectly good," go to Harvard.

25:01.157 --> 25:02.033
Jackass.

25:03.145 --> 25:04.400
Can you beat him to death with that?

25:04.512 --> 25:05.843
I don't think so. It's soft serve.

25:07.056 --> 25:08.222
I got your ice cream. 

25:09.556 --> 25:10.922
What is this?

25:11.321 --> 25:12.904
- Strawberry ice cream. 
- It has strawberries in it.

25:13.406 --> 25:15.279
I don't even know how to respond to that.

25:15.397 --> 25:18.479
I wanted plain strawberry ice cream without chunks of strawberries in it.

25:18.622 --> 25:20.915
- This has chunks. 
- I see one.

25:21.059 --> 25:22.242
I can't eat this. Take it away.

25:22.406 --> 25:23.706
Would you like me to get you something else?

25:23.840 --> 25:24.787
No, just forget it.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.388
Fine. Bring it back.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.785
- Are you okay, Doyle? 
- Yes. Why wouldn't I be?

25:32.892 --> 25:35.334
I don't know. You just seem a little bit annoyed tonight.

25:35.447 --> 25:38.571
I have an issue to put out with a big hole on the back page

25:38.760 --> 25:41.879
because my editorial writers chose to be unopinionated today!

25:42.067 --> 25:43.132
And that's it?

25:44.483 --> 25:47.249
And I got rejected for a job as Yale's stringer to Time magazine.

25:47.469 --> 25:49.343
Ah, so, that explains it.

25:49.490 --> 25:51.022
This is a major blow to my career, you know.

25:51.140 --> 25:51.902
You're twenty.

25:52.021 --> 25:54.059
These things can follow you, Rory. One day you're feeling good,

25:54.161 --> 25:56.670
you're the fair-haired boy, and the next day you're Schleprock.

25:56.777 --> 25:57.940
You're not Schleprock, Doyle.

25:58.088 --> 25:59.003
Tell that to my dad.

25:59.419 --> 26:02.727
Okay, I just have to say how amazingly unfair it is

26:02.824 --> 26:06.746
that I have a rubber band working its way into my brain, and Paris gets to bail.

26:06.951 --> 26:08.481
- Paris isn't here? 
- No, she isn't.

26:08.655 --> 26:09.679
You didn't know she left?

26:09.864 --> 26:12.781
No, I knew that there was this thing with her family,

26:12.991 --> 26:15.337
that she was really concerned about.

26:15.501 --> 26:18.261
Well, you know she got that call, and her aunt is sick,

26:18.373 --> 26:20.872
and I heard her say something about going to the hospital

26:20.964 --> 26:22.674
so I think that's where she went.

26:22.868 --> 26:25.346
All right. Well, come get me the minute she gets back.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.370
I will.

26:33.416 --> 26:35.139
Hey, do you have a Cosmo lying around?

26:35.255 --> 26:37.184
'Cause I wanna see how many calories I just burned off.

26:37.292 --> 26:39.340
I've looked. It's 55.

26:39.457 --> 26:42.090
Oh, no, it's way more than 55.

26:42.488 --> 26:46.630
I know what 55 is, and that, my friend, was not 55.

26:46.986 --> 26:47.779
Thanks.

26:48.397 --> 26:50.040
Are you cold? I could turn up the heat.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.064
Oh, please, enough with the bragging.

26:52.898 --> 26:54.311
So, you're good?

26:54.582 --> 26:59.565
I'm good. I'm gonna fall asleep extremely happy tonight.

27:02.518 --> 27:04.234
- Hi. 
- Hi back.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.562
Are you thinking about joining me back here anytime soon?

27:07.838 --> 27:09.127
Joining you...

27:10.096 --> 27:11.443
- Well... 
- Jason?

27:12.286 --> 27:16.951
Okay, just remember, you like that I have little quirks.

27:18.561 --> 27:20.372
They're what make me me.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.198
You're not gonna ask to wear my dress, are you?

27:22.671 --> 27:25.272
No. I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind

27:25.349 --> 27:26.875
sleeping in the guest room tonight.

27:28.027 --> 27:29.118
Well...

27:29.835 --> 27:31.221
didn't see that one coming.

27:31.355 --> 27:34.205
I am the world's lightest sleeper. I have chronic insomnia,

27:34.278 --> 27:37.698
so I just, I toss and I turn like a crazy person,

27:37.795 --> 27:40.243
and I can't sleep in the same bed with another person.

27:40.356 --> 27:41.629
- You're serious? 
- Yeah.

27:41.799 --> 27:43.377
You want me to go in the guest room?

27:43.503 --> 27:45.640
It's a really nice room.

27:45.809 --> 27:47.437
You know, why don't I just go?

27:47.538 --> 27:50.268
Oh, no, no, no, please, I swear, I want you to stay.

27:50.365 --> 27:52.516
I want to see you in the morning. I wanna make you breakfast.

27:52.622 --> 27:53.990
I want you to be here when I get up.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.935
Well, not here... in there, but...

27:57.022 --> 27:59.447
You know, Jason, you don't have to go to all this trouble

27:59.592 --> 28:00.808
just to get me to leave.

28:00.908 --> 28:02.048
I don't want you to leave.

28:02.162 --> 28:03.611
I'm a big girl, I can handle the truth.

28:03.729 --> 28:04.547
This is the truth.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.410
It's fine, I have things I need to do tomorrow.

28:07.569 --> 28:09.443
I should probably go home anyhow.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.416
Please, just look at the room.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.872
Just one look. A peek.

28:17.005 --> 28:18.736
You don't even have to use both eyes if you don't want to.

28:20.583 --> 28:22.602
- One look. 
- That's all I ask.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.997
Well, that, and you get out of the bed very slowly.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.703
You know what, don't flirt with me.

28:29.825 --> 28:31.234
I'm finding you weird right now.

28:31.371 --> 28:32.457
Fair enough. Here you go.

28:36.245 --> 28:37.126
Here it is.

28:40.568 --> 28:41.417
It's okay.

28:42.031 --> 28:44.986
There are hundreds of great books in here,

28:45.164 --> 28:47.444
ranging from the classics - "Wuthering Heights" -

28:47.551 --> 28:50.289
to the real classics - "Valley of the Dolls."

28:50.428 --> 28:51.227
Nice taste.

28:51.371 --> 28:54.120
Fully loaded minibar - soda, candy, little bottles of hooch.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.843
A really great CD player,

28:57.135 --> 28:59.614
CD's down below, and a DVD library above.

28:59.762 --> 29:01.211
DVD's but no TV?

29:09.955 --> 29:11.877
Oh, come on, that is cool.

29:12.004 --> 29:14.482
Okay, fine, it's cool. The room is good.

29:15.082 --> 29:17.579
It's better than good. I would love this room.

29:17.866 --> 29:19.546
You do know you can have it, don't you?

29:19.715 --> 29:22.617
I can't have any distractions in my room or I won't sleep.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.893
- Really? 
- That's right.

29:25.741 --> 29:28.793
TV, reading material, unbelievably gorgeous woman.

29:29.730 --> 29:32.106
I should at least get billing over the TV.

29:32.357 --> 29:34.030
- It's plasma. 
- Oh, right.

29:34.409 --> 29:36.616
- So, what do you think? 
- Well...

29:37.441 --> 29:38.890
There's Kiehl's products in the bathroom.

29:39.509 --> 29:40.734
Jason, I promise,

29:41.547 --> 29:43.528
if I leave, it won't be that big a deal.

29:43.728 --> 29:45.750
It'll be a very big deal to me.

29:46.032 --> 29:48.316
Please. Stay.

29:50.532 --> 29:51.787
- Okay. 
- Yes?

29:52.765 --> 29:54.536
Yes. Freak.

29:54.910 --> 29:55.760
Thank you.

29:56.314 --> 29:57.819
Even for the "freak," thank you.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.257
There's a loofah in the top drawer.

30:09.657 --> 30:10.286
Good night.

30:11.024 --> 30:11.919
Good night.

31:13.383 --> 31:14.569
It's late.

31:15.859 --> 31:18.732
Late, late, late...

31:21.413 --> 31:22.607
Don't you wanna know where I was?

31:23.420 --> 31:24.532
No, I don't.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.322
I completely lost track of time.

31:28.264 --> 31:30.476
I guess I should remember to take a watch with me from now on.

31:32.812 --> 31:35.550
Man, when I got that call tonight, I had no idea it was gonna go this late.

31:37.774 --> 31:40.132
Yes, it was quite a night.

31:41.074 --> 31:41.828
Tonight.

31:44.622 --> 31:46.286
You're sure you don't wanna know where I was?

31:46.435 --> 31:48.345
No, I don't wanna know where you were,

31:48.447 --> 31:51.776
and I don't wanna know what you were doing or who you were doing it with.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.259
I had to cover for you when Doyle noticed that you were gone,

31:54.376 --> 31:56.987
so I told him that you were at a family thing, and as far as I'm concerned,

31:57.141 --> 31:59.296
that's where you were - at your family thing.

31:59.409 --> 32:02.425
And in the future, I want nothing to do with anything to do

32:02.512 --> 32:05.175
with what you were doing tonight or who you were doing it with,

32:05.344 --> 32:06.618
especially who!

32:07.084 --> 32:08.057
Now, go to sleep.

32:10.668 --> 32:12.067
I smell like pipe tobacco.

32:12.270 --> 32:13.618
Oh, jeez.

32:23.855 --> 32:24.800
Hi, Cyrus.

32:25.732 --> 32:29.439
Oh, good. Listen, would you still find me attractive if I were poor?

32:30.001 --> 32:31.687
Um, no.

32:31.897 --> 32:33.458
Ah, that's what I figured. Sleep good?

32:33.831 --> 32:35.695
I watched "The Daily Show,"

32:35.817 --> 32:38.097
fell into the best sleep I ever had, woke up,

32:38.281 --> 32:39.893
watched "Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"

32:40.109 --> 32:42.499
had a vanilla-scented jacuzzi bath.

32:42.797 --> 32:45.125
Ah, so that's what the look on your face is.

32:45.235 --> 32:46.443
I thought it was from sex with me.

32:46.607 --> 32:48.209
No, it's from the jacuzzi bath.

32:48.828 --> 32:50.093
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

32:51.563 --> 32:53.242
- Coffee's over here. 
- Thank you.

32:54.168 --> 32:55.500
The coffee smells good.

32:55.888 --> 32:59.452
Hey, can we... not sleep together again tonight?

32:59.612 --> 33:02.405
Absolutely. You want cheese in your eggs?

33:02.602 --> 33:03.364
Why not?

33:04.680 --> 33:06.215
Mm, good.

33:06.809 --> 33:08.407
I think we're ready to go.

33:13.789 --> 33:15.580
Wow, look what you've done here.

33:15.892 --> 33:17.464
Well, I am trying to impress you.

33:17.889 --> 33:19.778
Trust me, once you're completely mad about me,

33:19.968 --> 33:21.863
it is back to corn flakes and beer.

33:27.075 --> 33:28.994
- This is lovely. 
- You are lovely.

33:34.418 --> 33:35.181
Very good.

33:35.473 --> 33:36.777
Tomorrow I'll make blintzes.

33:37.686 --> 33:39.788
Listen, we should talk about what we're gonna do.

33:40.019 --> 33:40.833
About what?

33:41.012 --> 33:42.814
I mean, you know, what we're gonna...

33:43.808 --> 33:45.390
say to people about us.

33:45.641 --> 33:48.206
How about "yahoo"?

33:48.359 --> 33:50.832
No, I'm talking about what we're gonna say to my parents about us.

33:51.011 --> 33:52.379
Oh, well, I thought we'd say that we're having

33:52.485 --> 33:54.771
repeated sexual encounters out of wedlock continuously

33:54.939 --> 33:56.838
as catholic schoolchildren are walking by.

33:56.971 --> 33:57.666
Perfect.

33:57.806 --> 33:58.676
No, you know...

33:58.928 --> 34:00.299
we like each other, we're dating...

34:00.687 --> 34:02.087
pretty simple.

34:02.838 --> 34:05.030
Nothing is simple when it comes to my parents.

34:05.234 --> 34:06.336
Okay, what do you want to say?

34:06.535 --> 34:07.385
I'd like to say nothing.

34:07.871 --> 34:08.755
Nothing?

34:08.937 --> 34:11.471
I mean, it isn't really any of their business anyhow, is it?

34:11.722 --> 34:13.350
No, but we can't just say nothing.

34:13.493 --> 34:15.775
It'll cause too many problems if they know.

34:15.893 --> 34:18.536
In my experience, these things have a way of coming out.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.467
- How? 
- I don't know. Somebody slips up.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.237
I never slip up. I'm completely non-slip.

34:22.371 --> 34:24.331
I'm like one of those rubber mats you stick in the bottom of the tub.

34:24.482 --> 34:25.833
Why can't we tell your parents about this?

34:25.936 --> 34:27.313
I just think it's weird.

34:27.485 --> 34:29.714
You're in business with my father and he won't like this.

34:29.862 --> 34:30.646
He'll get used to it.

34:30.784 --> 34:32.324
My father has never gotten used to anything.

34:32.422 --> 34:34.425
He still misses diesel fuel, for God's sake.

34:34.558 --> 34:36.400
You don't find it exhausting, keeping secrets?

34:36.507 --> 34:37.914
You have to watch everything you say.

34:38.070 --> 34:41.795
I always have to watch everything that I say around my parents anyway.

34:41.904 --> 34:44.248
Okay, how about we just tell one of them, just to see how that goes?

34:44.393 --> 34:45.672
Please, Jason.

34:45.989 --> 34:50.471
We will tell them eventually, I promise, just not now.

34:50.782 --> 34:53.029
Okay. They're your parents,

34:53.138 --> 34:55.406
and if you feel that strongly, then we'll wait.

34:55.755 --> 34:56.399
Thank you.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.371
Hey, can I feed this to Cyrus?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.957
Sure. Hey, Cyrus, you want the bacon?

35:06.491 --> 35:08.217
That is one strange dog, Jason.

35:21.050 --> 35:23.550
Excuse me. Do you know how much longer it's going on?

35:23.956 --> 35:25.267
No...

35:27.556 --> 35:29.444
- Well, hello. 
- Are we too late?

35:29.577 --> 35:30.996
- No, of course not. 
- Good.

35:31.119 --> 35:33.074
- May I have your ticket, please? 
- I don't have a ticket.

35:33.196 --> 35:34.703
Well, you can't take the tour without a ticket.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.358
Excuse me, Dorrie, this is my daughter.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.743
Oh! Well, hello there.

35:39.239 --> 35:42.224
- Come in, Lorelai. 
- Okay. Bye.

35:43.801 --> 35:45.358
Mom, what is going on?

35:45.686 --> 35:48.455
We let the Historical Society use our house for a walking tour.

35:48.538 --> 35:50.641
It's for a good cause, and I am never doing it again.

35:53.579 --> 35:55.843
It was supposed to end at five o'clock, Emily.

35:56.003 --> 35:58.681
I know that, Richard. What do you want me to do, throw them out?

35:58.833 --> 36:01.523
This is not how it's done. This is not how proper charities work.

36:01.835 --> 36:05.259
You do not infringe on people's lives. You make a plan and stick to it.

36:05.413 --> 36:09.094
Oh, look. They hired actors to be the family. How clever.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.132
- We are not actors! 
- Richard, please.

36:11.245 --> 36:13.384
Oh no, folks, this is not part of the tour.

36:13.595 --> 36:14.512
Sorry, Emily.

36:14.676 --> 36:15.960
That's quite all right, Dorrie.

36:16.012 --> 36:17.071
It is not all right, Dorrie.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.171
Richard, just ignore it and pass the carrots.

36:19.606 --> 36:22.801
This is lunacy. I feel as if I was in a zoo.

36:22.954 --> 36:24.352
Well, Dad, you know what monkeys do

36:24.423 --> 36:25.862
when they don't like people staring at them in the zoo.

36:25.954 --> 36:27.606
- No, I don't. 
- And you don't want to.

36:27.696 --> 36:29.123
- How do you know? 
- I can just tell.

36:30.184 --> 36:32.641
Don't play that piano! Don't you see the sign?

36:33.316 --> 36:34.387
There was supposed to be a sign.

36:34.530 --> 36:36.358
- There is a sign. 
- It's not a very good sign.

36:36.558 --> 36:39.942
The house was built in 1906 by Stanford White.

36:40.034 --> 36:40.818
That's it.

36:42.042 --> 36:45.810
The house was built in 1907, and he was a protégé of Stanford White.

36:45.912 --> 36:46.880
I'm getting a migraine.

36:48.213 --> 36:50.074
So, you're a full-fledged newspaper-woman now.

36:50.183 --> 36:51.948
- Yes, I am. 
- Congratulations.

36:52.062 --> 36:52.774
Thank you.

36:52.947 --> 36:54.233
Now you gotta get yourself a nickname like

36:54.335 --> 36:55.881
Smitty and start talking really fast.

36:56.101 --> 36:57.141
Faster than I already do?

36:57.376 --> 36:58.400
Hey, whatever it takes.

36:58.554 --> 37:00.090
What where you going to do, hit the man?

37:00.351 --> 37:03.592
- He went into my desk! 
- He was 85 years old.

37:03.812 --> 37:05.527
It's never too late to learn a lesson.

37:06.178 --> 37:08.824
- This is it, Emily. I mean it. 
- I know you do, Richard.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.245
The next time you plan a function, we will rent a hall and do it properly,

37:12.358 --> 37:14.579
like the fibromyalgia function last night.

37:14.672 --> 37:16.351
That is the proper way to raise money.

37:16.603 --> 37:18.660
You went to a function last night, you had a function tonight...

37:18.742 --> 37:21.169
We didn't host the one last night. We were just guests.

37:21.262 --> 37:22.540
- Was it fun? 
- It was fine.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.041
It wasn't here. It was perfect.

37:24.231 --> 37:25.465
The food was terrible.

37:25.608 --> 37:28.736
The fact that people still insist on serving paella is simply beyond me.

37:28.932 --> 37:30.478
However, the room looked lovely.

37:30.601 --> 37:31.671
And the music was excellent.

37:31.799 --> 37:34.420
And the guest list was very good - a lovely group of people, except for...

37:34.522 --> 37:35.168
Emily!

37:35.322 --> 37:37.722
Would it have hurt the woman to buy an undergarment?

37:37.818 --> 37:38.818
Who?

37:38.931 --> 37:40.159
She was a very nice girl.

37:40.303 --> 37:42.376
I wouldn't request to see her thesis on anything,

37:42.474 --> 37:44.092
but she was charming and a good dancer.

37:44.210 --> 37:46.457
Who's the dumb girl without the underwear?

37:46.683 --> 37:47.854
Jason's date.

37:50.385 --> 37:51.838
Jason brought a date?

37:51.915 --> 37:53.606
And I had to sit next to her all night.

37:53.707 --> 37:55.371
Oh, the fascinating time we had.

37:55.448 --> 37:58.059
I know all the best places to get my acrylics filled.

37:58.202 --> 38:00.307
Your mother is a snob. She was quite beautiful.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.177
She was, huh?

38:01.315 --> 38:03.128
She's perfect for Jason, I will say that.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.345
So, how beautiful was she?

38:05.606 --> 38:08.207
Are we talking Catherine Zeta-Jones or the weird-looking Hilton sister?

38:08.392 --> 38:10.440
She looks like exactly the kind of gold digger

38:10.553 --> 38:13.133
who would latch onto an immature little con artist like Jason.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.046
My goodness, Emily, tell us how you really feel about the boy.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.217
But when you say gold digger,

38:18.364 --> 38:19.737
do you mean she was cheap-looking?

38:19.865 --> 38:20.741
- Yes. 
- No.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.082
So is he serious about this girl?

38:22.210 --> 38:25.364
Oh, who can tell? She looks like a perfectly fine first wife for him.

38:25.987 --> 38:28.212
Now the old man is just baiting me.

38:28.657 --> 38:30.771
What did I tell you about the piano?

38:31.042 --> 38:33.489
You know, we don't have to put the reception area over there.

38:33.633 --> 38:36.029
I just want to know where my office is going to be.

38:36.261 --> 38:38.334
Fonzie used the bathroom as his office.

38:38.507 --> 38:40.617
Yeah, what are you saying, that what's good enough for the Fonz

38:40.698 --> 38:41.938
- isn't good enough for you? 
- Yeah.

38:42.041 --> 38:43.735
Fonzie used that bathroom office only intermittently

38:43.827 --> 38:45.957
and not for any business for which he was paid.

38:46.295 --> 38:48.938
He had use of a private office at the auto shop he worked at,

38:49.151 --> 38:53.146
then access to the teachers' lounge where he taught night school part time.

38:53.269 --> 38:55.869
Oh my God, you're taking this Fonzie thing way too seriously.

38:56.014 --> 38:57.190
Lorelai, am I interrupting?

38:57.391 --> 38:58.732
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?

38:58.875 --> 38:59.797
I was on my way to New York,

38:59.914 --> 39:01.829
and I wanted to see this inn you're always talking about.

39:01.987 --> 39:04.553
- Oh, sure. 
- Hello, I'm Sookie.

39:04.688 --> 39:07.210
Sookie's my partner here.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.289
Hi, Sookie, I'm Jason Stiles.

39:09.535 --> 39:10.917
Yes, you are.

39:11.378 --> 39:13.148
Michel Gerard.

39:13.304 --> 39:15.131
And Michel is the manager of the Dragonfly.

39:15.290 --> 39:16.124
It's nice to meet you.

39:16.581 --> 39:19.114
Okay, so, I'm just gonna show Jason around.

39:19.222 --> 39:21.285
- Take your time. 
- Follow me.

39:23.579 --> 39:25.708
- Your friends seem really nice. 
- Oh, they're the best.

39:26.026 --> 39:27.723
So, who do they think I am?

39:28.202 --> 39:29.017
What do you mean?

39:29.237 --> 39:31.352
Did you tell 'em we're dating or do they think I make your hats?

39:31.648 --> 39:32.591
They know who you are.

39:32.949 --> 39:34.080
This place is really great.

39:34.321 --> 39:35.463
- Yeah, you think? 
- I do.

39:35.894 --> 39:37.045
Good, that's good.

39:38.182 --> 39:41.150
You seem a little distracted. Did I come at a bad time?

39:41.382 --> 39:43.727
- No, you came at a perfect time. 
- Perfect time for...

39:43.845 --> 39:45.351
I heard you went to a function the other night.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.768
Ah, fibromyalgia - a very dull disease.

39:47.869 --> 39:49.543
- I also heard you didn't go alone. 
- No, I didn't.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.805
- So, you brought a date? 
- Yes, I did.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.365
Okay, good. That's good, I'm glad.

39:55.565 --> 39:58.288
My mother said she didn't wear any underwear.

39:58.431 --> 39:59.573
Emily didn't wear any underwear?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.447
Your date didn't wear any underwear.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.675
Oh, I don't know that for a fact, but if Emily said so,

40:03.762 --> 40:05.138
far be it from me to call her a liar.

40:07.879 --> 40:10.499
Okay. Hey, you wanna see the stables?

40:10.709 --> 40:12.292
- Sure. 
- Well, there they are.

40:12.449 --> 40:14.207
Well, tour's over. Bathroom's to the left.

40:14.607 --> 40:16.249
You wanna tell me what you're bothered about?

40:17.534 --> 40:20.853
We're sleeping together, and you're taking bare-butted women to functions?

40:21.134 --> 40:22.563
Crystal is just a friend...

40:22.721 --> 40:24.831
A friend named Crystal?

40:25.092 --> 40:26.659
Who are you, Hugh Hefner?

40:26.792 --> 40:29.756
Wow, wait a sec. I would have much rather taken you to that function.

40:29.863 --> 40:32.382
Trust me, Crystal is very sweet, but the mocking of the sick

40:32.495 --> 40:34.492
is completely beyond her capabilities.

40:34.731 --> 40:38.316
But you told me in no uncertain terms that your parents were not supposed to know about us,

40:38.486 --> 40:40.953
and since this is a function your parents would be attending,

40:41.031 --> 40:42.853
I thought taking you would be out of the question.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.196
Well, you could've gone alone.

40:44.343 --> 40:45.879
You don't go to these things alone.

40:46.022 --> 40:47.841
There are two seats and you're expected to fill them.

40:47.963 --> 40:50.764
You could've told me so I wasn't blindsided by my parents.

40:50.964 --> 40:53.421
See, this is what I mean about keeping secrets. It never works.

40:53.522 --> 40:56.262
Let's just tell your parents, then we never have to have this conversation again.

40:57.184 --> 40:59.442
Lorelai, I am in a business where there are lots of functions.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.463
I have to go to those functions, and I don't want to take other people,

41:02.565 --> 41:05.320
but I'm gonna have to if you won't let me say something to your father.

41:06.052 --> 41:11.161
I have no interest in spending a second of my time with any other woman but you.

41:11.284 --> 41:12.268
And Eartha Kitt.

41:13.071 --> 41:13.982
Well, sure.

41:14.244 --> 41:15.196
So, what do you say?

41:15.647 --> 41:17.606
Can we end the madness and tell your parents?

41:18.678 --> 41:19.733
- No. 
- No?

41:19.851 --> 41:21.926
I know it's tricky to keep this a secret,

41:22.037 --> 41:24.705
but I just don't think it's time to tell them yet.

41:24.802 --> 41:28.340
And if that means that I have to adjust, then I have to adjust.

41:29.052 --> 41:31.684
And now that you've told me how you feel,

41:31.807 --> 41:35.678
I think it's fine if you take Crystal to these functions.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.489
Well, it's fine for you - you don't have to talk to the woman.

41:37.628 --> 41:38.509
Oh, sorry.

41:38.642 --> 41:39.415
Hey, maybe you don't understand.

41:39.513 --> 41:41.688
It's like beating your head against a wall with spikes.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.397
Wanna see the apple trees?

41:44.549 --> 41:46.613
She thinks that Babe can really talk.

41:52.307 --> 41:53.483
Contemporary Political Fiction?

41:53.730 --> 41:54.872
- Yes. 
- Oh, good.

41:55.666 --> 41:58.364
I swore this semester would be different. I would get to class on time.

41:58.461 --> 42:00.651
I would finish my assignments on time. I would do everything on time.

42:01.364 --> 42:02.532
I left my purse on the bench.

42:07.329 --> 42:08.856
I haven't started speaking yet.

42:11.618 --> 42:13.499
Asher Fleming is teaching this course?

42:13.616 --> 42:14.645
I know. Isn't it cool?

42:17.107 --> 42:20.738
Ah, Rory Gilmore.

42:21.286 --> 42:23.140
- We meet again. 
- Hello, Professor Fleming.

42:23.591 --> 42:25.449
- You're taking this class? 
- Yes, I am.

42:25.592 --> 42:27.236
Wonderful. I look forward to it.

42:27.799 --> 42:30.462
After all, it seems very natural, doesn't it?

42:30.620 --> 42:35.039
Especially since you and I have someone very important in common.

42:35.807 --> 42:36.970
Your grandfather.

42:38.572 --> 42:39.474
Good man.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.423
Yes, sir. Very good.

42:41.670 --> 42:43.338
All right, well, let's get settled.

42:44.199 --> 42:47.956
The class is Contemporary Political Fiction. I am Professor Fleming.

42:48.336 --> 42:50.618
All those in the wrong class, please leave.

42:50.742 --> 42:52.493
How do you know you're in the wrong class?

42:52.668 --> 42:54.844
If you do not enjoy a good argument,

42:55.059 --> 42:57.438
if you find it difficult to voice a differing opinion,

42:57.598 --> 43:01.510
and if you cannot appreciate an intelligently cloaked insult,

43:02.222 --> 43:03.855
then you're in the wrong class.

43:04.152 --> 43:08.156
If all of these things appeal to you, then you are in for an interesting semester.

43:08.391 --> 43:09.880
I'll be handing out the reading lists.
