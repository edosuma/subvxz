00:22.115 --> 00:22.948
Nick!

00:24.450 --> 00:26.452
Leave me the fuck
alone, go away!

00:45.271 --> 00:47.571
Hey, fellow believer here.

00:47.573 --> 00:48.841
I don't know if it's true.

00:50.309 --> 00:52.376
The Rudwick Forest, the Legend
of the Shapeshifting Witch,

00:52.378 --> 00:56.413
I don't know but I definitely
think it's worth checking out.

00:56.415 --> 00:59.516
Our son went missing from
Rudwick seven years ago.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.684
We're still hoping
out hope after

01:00.686 --> 01:04.688
all these years
because we heard him.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.590
It has to be the
Rudwick Forest.

01:06.592 --> 01:08.792
The missing persons
rate there is 10 times

01:08.794 --> 01:11.162
higher than any other
location in America.

01:11.164 --> 01:14.365
We used to go hiking
out there in those woods.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.835
We started seeing some
weird shit in that forest.

01:18.437 --> 01:20.939
Hearing some weird
voices, weird noises.

01:22.375 --> 01:25.278
People say there's a witch
up there too, I don't know.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.454
This is our mom and she went

01:37.456 --> 01:39.590
missing in the Rudwick Forest.

01:39.592 --> 01:43.394
The police stopped looking
for her but we never did.

01:43.396 --> 01:46.463
He was calling for
help, he sounded hurt.

01:46.465 --> 01:49.500
We tried to follow his voice
but we couldn't find him.

01:49.502 --> 01:51.737
He's still out there,
he's still alive.

02:01.514 --> 02:03.013
What's up, believers?

02:03.015 --> 02:05.816
It's your boy Jimmy coming to
you straight from the Creep

02:05.818 --> 02:08.985
Jeep here with some very
exciting news for you guys.

02:08.987 --> 02:10.523
Right now as we speak...

02:11.490 --> 02:13.090
- Put it down.
- Nick, relax.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.326
- I'm not gonna break it.
- Oh yeah.

02:15.328 --> 02:17.461
That's what you
said about the C100.

02:17.463 --> 02:18.695
But the people need to see

02:18.697 --> 02:21.098
my face in stunning
high definition...

02:21.100 --> 02:22.299
You're holding our entire

02:22.301 --> 02:24.067
production budget,
so please be careful.

02:24.069 --> 02:25.302
I'm always careful, Nick.

02:25.304 --> 02:27.438
Anyway as I was saying,
we have tallied all of

02:27.440 --> 02:29.640
y'all's innumerous votes
determining where our

02:29.642 --> 02:32.409
next haunted location
shall be and the winner

02:32.411 --> 02:34.813
in a unanimous
landslide victory is

02:36.415 --> 02:37.583
Rudwick Forest

02:39.318 --> 02:40.651
and we can't wait
to bring you guys

02:40.653 --> 02:42.853
along with us for more
paranormal activity.

02:42.855 --> 02:45.256
But if that news was
not exciting enough,

02:45.258 --> 02:47.126
Amy, should I tell them?

02:49.295 --> 02:50.561
- Yeah, let's tell 'em.
- Listen.

02:50.563 --> 02:53.832
Our deal with A&E
has been finalized.

02:55.168 --> 02:56.400
- Big leagues, baby.
- It's the big leagues indeed

02:56.402 --> 02:58.769
and that means you guys
can expect tons more

02:58.771 --> 03:01.838
heebie-jeebie shaking,
mind-tingling,

03:01.840 --> 03:06.845
goosebump-raising with our
quest into the great unknown.

03:07.713 --> 03:08.945
All right, you know what?

03:08.947 --> 03:10.013
I think it's time
to get my baby back.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.416
- Come on, gently, gently.
- Road trip.

03:16.455 --> 03:19.290
I don't think we're
gonna get any music today.

03:19.292 --> 03:20.459
Just scan it.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.376
Have we confirmed
times with both of 'em?

04:12.378 --> 04:15.848
Yeah, both the father
and the Ranger are booked.

04:18.384 --> 04:22.353
Oh, but the Ranger said he
won't come to the cabin.

04:22.355 --> 04:23.188
Why not?

04:24.957 --> 04:28.492
He said it's too
close to the woods.

04:28.494 --> 04:29.993
Great, well that's more

04:29.995 --> 04:32.095
money that we get
to spend on gas.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.130
Nick, relax.

04:34.132 --> 04:37.167
It'll be worth it, it'll
be a great interview.

04:37.169 --> 04:39.002
Oh Amy, your nose.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.504
What?

04:40.506 --> 04:41.705
Oh.

04:41.707 --> 04:43.507
Shit Jimmy, will
you get me a napkin?

04:43.509 --> 04:44.708
Yeah yeah, one second.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.311
- Come on Jimmy, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

04:47.313 --> 04:48.545
Put her seat
back, put her seat back.

04:48.547 --> 04:51.114
Shit, let me
put the camera down.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.183
There you
go, put it back.

04:53.185 --> 04:54.019
Grab her pillow.

04:55.954 --> 04:59.423
Come on
Ames, now come on.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.425
Here we go, I
got her, I got her.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.161
There we go, okay we're good.

05:05.063 --> 05:05.964
Here we go.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.565
I thought she
was taking these new meds.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.834
- Yeah, so did I man.
- You all right?

05:10.836 --> 05:11.868
I'm all right, you all right?

05:11.870 --> 05:13.236
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

05:13.238 --> 05:15.872
We're all good then,
we're all good.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.247
I still think we
should call Dr. Mathis.

05:24.249 --> 05:27.651
No baby, I'm fine,
I promise okay?

05:27.653 --> 05:32.090
I just hadn't taken my pill
enough for it to build up.

05:35.328 --> 05:36.161
Okay.

05:37.763 --> 05:39.129
Do you want
anything from inside?

05:39.131 --> 05:39.965
Yeah.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.600
- Can I get a Twizzlers please?
- Sure.

05:43.602 --> 05:46.603
And a King Size
Snickers for yours truly.

05:46.605 --> 05:50.140
Thank you very much,
also hey, Red Bull, Nick.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.310
Red Bull, bubble gum,
beef jerky, spicy.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.980
- Not teriyaki, I want spicy.
- You get one thing.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.215
One thing, I'm
the star of the show.

05:59.217 --> 06:01.952
- You get one thing.
- Cheap bastard.

06:01.954 --> 06:03.487
You had pick of the litter,

06:03.489 --> 06:06.156
pick of the litter and you
choose this cheap bastard.

06:06.158 --> 06:09.125
He means well, you
are just a mooch.

06:09.127 --> 06:10.796
That may be but, still.

06:14.533 --> 06:15.368
You okay?

06:16.535 --> 06:17.768
I don't think I've ever seen you

06:17.770 --> 06:19.603
seize up this early in
a trip before, Ames.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.507
Yeah, I'm fine,
I promise okay?

06:23.542 --> 06:24.875
Good.

06:24.877 --> 06:25.978
I'm glad to hear that.

06:27.913 --> 06:29.513
Hey, have you heard back from

06:29.515 --> 06:31.283
the executives
about our contracts?

06:33.085 --> 06:34.951
Yeah no they, I don't know.

06:34.953 --> 06:37.821
They said something about
checking with their lawyers,

06:37.823 --> 06:39.923
some lawyer shit they're
doing, I don't know.

06:39.925 --> 06:41.692
They said they would
make sure they're good.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.962
- Keep me posted, okay?
- Yeah yeah, I will.

06:48.701 --> 06:51.635
- Jimmy.
- Stop, I'm doing my hair.

06:51.637 --> 06:53.870
- Lock your door.
- Wait wait, look look.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.206
Some of my paparazzi
potentially.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.974
- Yeah, one of your fans.
- Yeah, do you blame 'em?

06:57.976 --> 07:01.077
Excuse me, is
that a camera I see.

07:01.079 --> 07:05.148
Yes, we are shooting for
our paranormal TV show.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.418
Does that mean y'all are
heading up to Rudwick Forest?

07:07.420 --> 07:08.885
- Yeah.
- Well let me tell ya,

07:08.887 --> 07:11.056
all the rumors about
that place are true.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.457
- Nice.
- Mm hmm.

07:13.459 --> 07:15.426
My second cousin Davis
went missing up in

07:15.428 --> 07:17.694
them woods and the police
never found the body.

07:17.696 --> 07:21.297
Mm mm, it's like it disappeared,
poof, into thin air.

07:21.299 --> 07:22.601
That is awesome.

07:26.705 --> 07:28.238
So thanks for talking...

07:28.240 --> 07:31.174
What channel did y'all say
this was gonna be on again?

07:31.176 --> 07:35.045
Well, this is
actually gonna be on A&E.

07:35.047 --> 07:37.047
- Yeah.
- That's right.

07:37.049 --> 07:38.649
- Oh my god.
- We are their newest stars.

07:38.651 --> 07:40.817
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV?

07:40.819 --> 07:42.185
You're gonna
be on TV a little bit.

07:42.187 --> 07:43.687
I'm gonna be on there a lot.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.155
You'll also see them on there
occasionally but not really.

07:45.157 --> 07:49.325
But yeah, hey would you want
to say our catchphrase with us?

07:49.327 --> 07:52.829
Oh my god, I would
love to, what is it?

07:52.831 --> 07:55.031
Three, two, one.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.935
I'm a believer!

07:58.103 --> 07:59.470
I can't believe
I'm gonna be on TV.

07:59.472 --> 08:01.707
My boyfriend's gonna
lose his damn mind.

08:12.017 --> 08:16.419
There is
nothing out here.

08:16.421 --> 08:18.522
Like literally nothing.

08:18.524 --> 08:21.357
Nick, are you sure we're
going the right way?

08:21.359 --> 08:23.560
- This does not look right.
- Yeah man.

08:23.562 --> 08:26.730
I mean if I could
get the GPS to work,

08:26.732 --> 08:28.298
then I could probably
tell you where we're at.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.734
- Here, let me try.
- You know,

08:30.736 --> 08:32.837
God forbid we ever go to

08:33.905 --> 08:35.871
a nice, exotic location

08:35.874 --> 08:39.809
to find these haunted
places, you know, like Fiji,

08:39.812 --> 08:40.645
the Maldives,

08:41.780 --> 08:42.981
Vegas.

08:47.119 --> 08:48.318
Yeah, it's still not working.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.153
How far did it say
last time you checked?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.022
I thought it said
just a couple of miles.

08:52.024 --> 08:54.825
Oh yeah, no big deal.

08:54.827 --> 08:55.994
Don't beat yourself up.

08:57.195 --> 08:59.563
You just got us lost
in a killer haunted

08:59.565 --> 09:02.768
forest with a witch, no
big deal, we're fine.

09:06.304 --> 09:07.773
Wait wait, is
that it up there?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.012
Well isn't
this just lovely?

09:15.814 --> 09:17.480
Not as bad as it
probably could be

09:17.482 --> 09:20.083
for being way out here
in the middle of nowhere.

09:20.085 --> 09:22.721
- We're on a budget, Jimmy.
- I know, we always are.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.390
Here we go,
these must be our guys.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.562
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

09:30.996 --> 09:32.262
I didn't know
the guys from Deliverance

09:32.264 --> 09:34.767
still rented cabins to
people, look at this.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.001
It's probably
fine, Nick is always

09:38.003 --> 09:40.771
really careful about
the places we stay.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.440
All right.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.313
All right,
come on, let's go.

09:49.347 --> 09:51.982
Watch your step there.

09:51.984 --> 09:55.185
Torch sticks we'll get to you.

09:55.187 --> 09:58.388
All right, the kitchen's on
the right, rooms in the back.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.757
There's a downstairs in case
you need some peace and quiet

10:00.759 --> 10:02.893
while you're working, it's
got a nice view of the woods.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.562
Great, did you
get the water hooked up?

10:05.564 --> 10:07.998
Yes sir, I got you hooked
up to the well out back.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.367
Now the AC acts up a
little bit but it works.

10:11.369 --> 10:13.269
- You guys are all set in here.
- Thank you.

10:13.271 --> 10:14.470
Thank you so much.

10:14.472 --> 10:16.640
What the fuck
are you looking at?

10:16.642 --> 10:18.609
What, what the
fuck are you talking about?

10:18.611 --> 10:21.146
Chase, go wait in the truck.

10:24.549 --> 10:26.218
Seriously?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.154
I apologize for my nephew.

10:31.156 --> 10:33.957
That's all right,
do we still have

10:33.959 --> 10:35.726
full access to the
woods like we discussed?

10:35.728 --> 10:37.360
Oh, yes sir.

10:37.362 --> 10:40.664
Did any of the people who
went missing stay in this cabin?

10:40.666 --> 10:42.599
I don't know about missing.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.002
Some of 'em have gotten lost.

10:45.203 --> 10:47.237
So you don't
believe in the witch?

10:47.239 --> 10:49.005
Look these tourists,
they're people who

10:49.007 --> 10:51.107
haven't been in the
woods their entire life.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.175
They come up here looking for

10:52.177 --> 10:54.177
the same haunted shit as you do.

10:54.179 --> 10:55.411
They go wandering off,

10:55.413 --> 10:57.582
they get lost in the
woods, plain and simple.

10:58.884 --> 11:00.118
You can quote me on that.

11:06.659 --> 11:08.224
What's up, believers?

11:08.226 --> 11:11.594
It's your boy Jimmy here, we
have arrived at the cabin.

11:11.596 --> 11:13.730
We've unpacked the
gear and now we are

11:13.732 --> 11:16.800
ready to begin our
quest into discovering

11:16.802 --> 11:20.238
the country's most
notorious haunted forest.

11:21.439 --> 11:24.908
With 43 disappearances
since the summer of 1968

11:24.910 --> 11:28.078
and no bodies recovered,
the authorities have

11:28.080 --> 11:30.781
no explanations to the
disappearances within the forest.

11:30.783 --> 11:32.048
That's right but
many locals believe

11:32.050 --> 11:36.452
it all began with this
woman, Greta Fullmer.

11:36.454 --> 11:37.988
In the summer of 1968,

11:37.990 --> 11:41.257
she abducted and killed 13
men, women and children.

11:41.259 --> 11:44.895
And the local police
found Greta dead

11:44.897 --> 11:47.664
in these woods surrounded
by her 13 victims.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.099
And next to the
gun that she killed

11:49.101 --> 11:51.902
herself with was a copy
of the Codex Gigas,

11:51.904 --> 11:54.437
otherwise known as
the Devil's Bible.

11:54.439 --> 11:56.106
Now ever since that summer,

11:56.108 --> 12:00.844
anyone who travels into these
woods alone is abducted.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.815
Brendan Wallows, age
30, missing June 1978.

12:04.817 --> 12:09.119
Maggie Andrews, age
25, missing March 1983.

12:09.121 --> 12:11.822
Justin Haverdie, November 1986.

12:11.824 --> 12:14.991
Colin Smith, Mary
Furrow, Jonathan Banks.

12:14.993 --> 12:18.328
Those disappearances span over
the course of five decades.

12:18.330 --> 12:22.032
Right but that all ended
about six months ago.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.002
Meet Nelson Morgan.

12:25.337 --> 12:27.838
Father of Casey Morgan.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.875
They were hiking together
when Casey was abducted.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.443
This is big because
this is the first

12:33.445 --> 12:37.781
and only documented case
of an abduction in Rudwick

12:37.783 --> 12:40.152
involving two
hikers, the only one.

12:41.119 --> 12:42.385
We're speaking with Mr. Morgan

12:42.387 --> 12:44.955
tomorrow to find out
just what happened.

12:44.957 --> 12:46.656
I cannot wait, I'm
not gonna be able

12:46.658 --> 12:48.391
to sleep tonight, I'm
so excited, oh my god.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.561
Well that is all we have for
now believers but remember.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.999
The
cameras are always rolling.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.825
What's that?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.626
Yo, shh.

13:56.661 --> 13:57.462
Oh.

13:58.430 --> 13:59.764
Right well,

14:01.566 --> 14:03.101
it would appear

14:04.669 --> 14:05.503
that

14:08.006 --> 14:09.341
we have

14:10.342 --> 14:11.309
a visitor.

14:14.279 --> 14:16.114
That was a huge bump

14:17.282 --> 14:18.383
that sounded

14:20.518 --> 14:22.687
like it came from
inside the cabin.

14:57.222 --> 14:58.056
Nick.

15:00.959 --> 15:01.793
Guys?

15:06.999 --> 15:07.832
Guys?

15:09.234 --> 15:10.700
Dude, what?

15:10.702 --> 15:14.137
I heard
something, it's outside.

15:14.139 --> 15:18.308
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, stay right here.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.811
I swear.

15:21.013 --> 15:22.780
I don't make this up.

15:33.158 --> 15:34.993
- You see anything?
- No.

15:44.436 --> 15:46.869
What was it you heard?

15:46.871 --> 15:49.405
A bump
and it woke me up

15:49.407 --> 15:52.408
and then I heard
a louder bump that

15:52.410 --> 15:55.111
sounded like it came
from inside the cabin.

15:55.113 --> 15:57.080
So, we're
outside the cabin.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.481
Yeah we're
outside the cabin,

15:58.483 --> 15:59.715
I already looked into that.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.084
Then you got me
out of bed for this.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.885
- I really appreciate it.
- You know the next time

16:02.887 --> 16:04.187
that we're in a haunted forest

16:04.189 --> 16:05.888
with a witch, I'll
let you sleep.

16:05.890 --> 16:08.658
We're not even
in the forest yet, man.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.460
It wasn't
the creak of the cabin.

16:10.462 --> 16:14.697
It was a deliberate
thud, a bump,

16:14.699 --> 16:15.533
two of 'em.

16:17.202 --> 16:18.703
Sorry to disrupt your slumber.

16:19.637 --> 16:21.704
How do you know it wasn't me?

16:21.706 --> 16:23.808
Because your
fat ass was asleep.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.645
Hey, did you leave this open?

16:28.746 --> 16:30.648
No, I didn't.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.092
Oh, that's real funny.

16:42.094 --> 16:44.027
That's hilarious.

16:44.029 --> 16:45.295
- Hey wait.
- Yeah.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.063
That's the sound I
was talking about.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.932
I told you, I
wasn't lying to you.

16:49.934 --> 16:51.701
- All right.
- Oh, now you believe me.

16:51.703 --> 16:55.840
Okay great, I'm glad I
earned your trust eventually.

16:57.542 --> 17:00.576
I'm telling you, I
know what I heard.

17:00.578 --> 17:02.812
That the same sound
that you heard before?

17:02.814 --> 17:04.415
Yes, yes.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.332
I don't see
anything down here

17:21.465 --> 17:24.368
and it sounded like
a goddamn wolf.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.773
I told you,
there's someone out here.

17:30.775 --> 17:34.044
I know we're running
into trouble.

17:34.046 --> 17:35.380
Do you?

18:00.638 --> 18:03.973
- Do you see that right there?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:03.975 --> 18:04.876
Get back!

18:06.878 --> 18:09.379
It's just a
fuckin' guy who's wasted.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.415
She's here.

18:11.783 --> 18:13.749
Jimmy, go get my
phone and we'll call his uncle.

18:13.751 --> 18:16.286
Hey, you
shouldn't be here.

18:16.288 --> 18:17.955
Yeah, okay.

18:20.692 --> 18:25.228
Hang tight, we're gonna call
your uncle to come get you.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.530
- Jimmy, what's going on?
- You see Nick's phone?

18:27.532 --> 18:28.998
Yeah, what's up?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.034
This redneck's drunk nephew,
he's drunk and he's here.

18:32.036 --> 18:34.706
All right Chase, hey, you
had a lot to drink buddy?

18:35.607 --> 18:38.441
You don't belong here!

18:38.443 --> 18:42.013
You shouldn't a
come, none of you!

18:44.082 --> 18:45.483
She might keep you.

18:53.658 --> 18:55.125
I'll keep you.

18:55.127 --> 18:57.026
All right man that's
enough, it's time to go.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.496
Don't you fuckin' touch me!

19:00.298 --> 19:02.767
She's in you, she sees you.

19:04.702 --> 19:06.771
She's here huh, you
shouldn't a come!

19:11.343 --> 19:14.744
You get out of here,
you get out of here!

19:14.746 --> 19:18.850
- You shouldn't have come.
- We got him, we got him.

19:32.130 --> 19:32.964
Dammit Chase.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.699
I'm really, really
sorry about this.

19:36.701 --> 19:38.701
My nephew sometimes overdoes it.

19:38.703 --> 19:41.003
Clearly, I mean we
could've called the police.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.339
And I appreciate
that you didn't.

19:43.341 --> 19:45.007
I'm gonna get him outta
your hair, all right?

19:45.009 --> 19:46.911
We'll be outta here, Chase?

19:48.380 --> 19:53.385
Chase, wake up man, we're
gonna go home all right?

19:54.586 --> 19:55.187
One foot in front
of the other here.

19:56.288 --> 19:58.221
- It won't happen again.
- You need help?

19:58.223 --> 20:00.792
- No, we're used to this.
- All right.

20:04.429 --> 20:07.563
- I told them...
- You told 'em nothing.

20:07.565 --> 20:08.933
That they should up
and leave the house?

20:11.636 --> 20:12.604
Get in the truck.

20:16.841 --> 20:17.742
You're shit-faced.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.817
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Patrick.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.005
Ooh wee.

20:50.174 --> 20:51.676
This smells like
straight gasoline.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.844
Should we find
another place to stay?

20:54.846 --> 20:56.111
It's not in our budget.

20:56.113 --> 20:57.647
Babe, he tried to
break into the house.

20:57.649 --> 21:00.616
He was drunk, his uncle
said it won't happen again.

21:00.618 --> 21:02.552
Look we're tired, it's late.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.154
Let's just go to bed and
we'll try again tomorrow.

21:05.156 --> 21:07.259
- We'll be fine, I promise.
- Wait,

21:08.560 --> 21:09.394
wait.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.331
- Do you guys not hear that?
- Hear what?

21:15.333 --> 21:17.533
- Seriously.
- What?

21:17.535 --> 21:18.370
Listen.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.879
You're such an ass.

21:33.851 --> 21:35.453
Got that.

21:40.358 --> 21:41.724
Yo.

21:41.726 --> 21:44.627
- The hell are you doing Ames?
- Good morning.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.128
Well,

21:46.130 --> 21:47.363
- look.
- Wow.

21:47.365 --> 21:49.732
Ooh, ah, and mom
said I had no talents.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.702
Well no, mom is completely
and totally wrong.

21:52.704 --> 21:54.470
Look at the eyes in the middle.

21:54.472 --> 21:56.173
- Hey!
- Perfect, oh it's perfect.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.074
Sorry but I was first
out here and that

21:59.076 --> 22:01.811
little guy, he's at the
bottom of the totem pole.

22:01.813 --> 22:04.113
Hey Jimmy, are you
ready for this interview?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.449
I really want you to
press this guy hard.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.385
Yeah man, that's what
I do, I always bring it.

22:09.387 --> 22:11.854
Trying to decide what
I wanna wear, you know?

22:11.856 --> 22:14.657
I'm thinking about going
a little skimpy, you know?

22:14.659 --> 22:17.092
- Showing a little leg.
- Get your foot off the table.

22:17.094 --> 22:18.294
It's what
the people want to see.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.895
People do
not want to see that.

22:21.366 --> 22:23.098
Sorry, I'm just
gonna give it to 'em.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.303
Hey real quick,
gimme some of that.

22:26.904 --> 22:29.307
Get your hands off,
get your own, mooch.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.414
What about you,
are you ready for this?

22:38.416 --> 22:41.784
Yeah, I've done
this a million times.

22:41.786 --> 22:43.786
Yeah, I know.

22:43.788 --> 22:46.656
I just, I really want to do
this one right, you know?

22:46.658 --> 22:48.891
We need to start this
series off with a bang

22:48.893 --> 22:52.895
and we really spent a lot
of money on this new camera.

22:52.897 --> 22:53.965
Babe, babe.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.402
We're gonna be great, okay?

23:13.885 --> 23:16.053
What time's this guy
supposed to be here man?

23:17.655 --> 23:19.223
Five minutes ago, so.

23:21.793 --> 23:23.959
You think he's
gonna be a no-show?

23:23.961 --> 23:28.533
I hope not, he's kinda
pivotal to our case.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.535
He probably would be,
probably he's pretty unreliable.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.337
Wait.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.441
Wait, I think that's him.

23:37.642 --> 23:38.908
- That's the guy?
- Yeah, over here.

23:38.910 --> 23:40.142
That's William?

23:40.144 --> 23:41.811
Yeah okay, so
this is the Park Ranger.

23:41.813 --> 23:45.016
He was the one that was
on duty for Casey, right?

23:46.518 --> 23:50.152
So how long were you
a Park Ranger then?

23:50.154 --> 23:50.988
Seven years.

23:52.123 --> 23:53.689
And what, you
just up and decided

23:53.691 --> 23:55.024
you wanted to quit
six months ago?

23:55.026 --> 23:56.826
- Oh yeah.
- That was around the same

23:56.828 --> 23:58.561
time Casey Morgan disappeared.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.329
That was the
last straw for me.

24:00.331 --> 24:01.864
I don't know what they're
trying to cover up

24:01.866 --> 24:04.066
with these woods but I don't
want to have any part of it.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.001
So you do
believe that Nelson's

24:06.003 --> 24:07.703
daughter was taken by
something supernatural?

24:07.705 --> 24:10.406
Uh-huh, I mean
look, I know Nelson.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.908
He's an absolute fuck-up,
that's undeniable

24:12.910 --> 24:14.176
but to think he
had anything to do

24:14.178 --> 24:16.412
with his daughter's
disappearance, no.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.081
I mean that little girl
was his whole life.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.616
Okay.

24:20.618 --> 24:23.686
Why then are the Park
Rangers going through

24:23.688 --> 24:25.855
so many lengths to cover
up these missing bodies?

24:25.857 --> 24:28.591
- I mean it doesn't make...
- It's the revenue.

24:28.593 --> 24:32.094
This place brings in
tourists, it creates jobs.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.329
I mean listen, when
I was first hired

24:34.331 --> 24:37.166
as a Park Ranger and I
went through training,

24:37.168 --> 24:40.572
they told me explicitly never
to patrol the woods alone.

24:42.574 --> 24:45.608
So you think
that that's because

24:45.610 --> 24:47.843
all the people who
disappeared, they were

24:47.845 --> 24:50.112
abducted while they were
hiking by themselves?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.413
Absolutely.

24:51.415 --> 24:52.748
Absolutely, my partner did not

24:52.750 --> 24:54.819
want to talk about it
but they were real.

24:56.854 --> 25:00.456
So did you hear
voices, did you see something?

25:00.458 --> 25:01.292
Once.

25:02.393 --> 25:04.095
What did you see?

25:05.663 --> 25:08.263
- My mother.
- Okay.

25:08.265 --> 25:11.002
You saw your mother
in the forest?

25:12.169 --> 25:13.703
What the hell did she
say, what'd you do?

25:13.705 --> 25:15.538
Did you chase after
her, talk to her, what?

25:15.540 --> 25:18.009
- No.
- Why the hell not?

25:23.781 --> 25:25.617
My mother's been
dead for 10 years.

25:33.758 --> 25:35.925
- Hey hey, Nelson.
- Hi.

25:35.927 --> 25:37.126
Hey, I'm Jimmy.

25:37.128 --> 25:38.794
Yep great, yeah.

25:38.796 --> 25:42.565
- This is my sister Amy.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

25:42.567 --> 25:45.167
Thank you for coming
to see us, Mr. Morgan.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.903
Up there, that's Nick.

25:47.905 --> 25:50.508
He's the fella you spoke
to on the phone, up there.

25:51.475 --> 25:53.745
So did you find the place okay?

25:57.248 --> 25:58.049
Okay.

26:00.552 --> 26:04.419
Okay well, we don't want to
waste your time Mr. Morgan.

26:04.421 --> 26:06.255
So why don't you
follow me into the room

26:06.257 --> 26:08.290
and we'll do the
interview upstairs, okay?

26:08.292 --> 26:11.495
- Just right this way.
- Yeah please, after you.

26:12.730 --> 26:15.831
Do I say my name into there?

26:15.833 --> 26:18.002
Yeah yeah, right there,
whenever you're ready man.

26:20.171 --> 26:22.672
My name is Nelson Morgan,

26:22.674 --> 26:26.678
I am 47 years old and I
am of sound mind and body.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.281
Yeah, that's perfect.

26:32.283 --> 26:33.916
Great Nelson, what
we'll do here today

26:33.918 --> 26:35.818
is we'll just talk
a little bit, okay?

26:35.820 --> 26:36.952
We'll get to know
you a little bit,

26:36.954 --> 26:38.623
ask you a few questions
if that's okay.

26:39.490 --> 26:40.324
Yeah, okay.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.525
Let's start with the morning
of Casey's disappearance.

26:43.527 --> 26:46.097
Now what brought you to
Rudwick in the first place?

26:48.132 --> 26:50.399
Casey loves nature.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.501
I get her one weekend a month,

26:52.503 --> 26:55.671
so we tend to spend a lot
of time outside together.

26:55.673 --> 26:57.439
You were recently
divorced, right?

26:57.441 --> 26:58.974
- Yeah.
- If you don't mind me asking,

26:58.976 --> 27:00.978
what was the cause of
the separation, Nelson?

27:02.880 --> 27:06.248
I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.585
Well we were just...

27:08.552 --> 27:10.121
You're the psychic.

27:11.623 --> 27:13.725
Psychic is a strong word.

27:15.192 --> 27:18.527
I was actually hoping that
you could help me find her.

27:18.529 --> 27:20.965
If you could contact
her, help me find her.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.370
That's not really
how it works.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.473
Listen Nelson, I
understand that this can be

27:31.475 --> 27:33.909
really painful to relive all
the details of what happened.

27:33.911 --> 27:35.110
However we do have a lot of

27:35.112 --> 27:37.579
questions that need
answering, okay?

27:37.581 --> 27:39.915
Now the first of which is this.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.284
The police report said
you waited eight hours

27:42.286 --> 27:44.820
to contact them after
Casey went missing.

27:44.822 --> 27:47.491
Nelson, why would
you wait so long?

27:48.893 --> 27:50.893
I was searching for her.

27:50.895 --> 27:52.327
She's my daughter, I'm not gonna

27:52.329 --> 27:54.429
leave her out there by herself.

27:54.431 --> 27:57.134
And the police report also
said that you were drunk.

27:58.402 --> 27:59.902
- I wasn't drunk...
- You weren't drunk with Casey

27:59.904 --> 28:01.103
or you weren't drunk
at the police station?

28:01.105 --> 28:04.473
- I'm confused.
- No, I wasn't drunk.

28:04.475 --> 28:07.176
I had been searching
for a few hours.

28:07.178 --> 28:11.781
I had a bottle of whiskey
in the trunk of my car.

28:11.783 --> 28:15.651
I had a few sips to
take the edge off.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.153
I was scared, I had
just lost my daughter.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.389
Sure I get that, now but do
you remember an incident six

28:20.391 --> 28:23.227
months ago when Child Services
were called to your house?

28:24.361 --> 28:28.397
I came here so you
could help me find her.

28:28.399 --> 28:31.166
Not for you to judge me based on

28:31.168 --> 28:33.836
one neighbor who couldn't
mind her business.

28:33.838 --> 28:35.104
I get that Nelson but you've

28:35.106 --> 28:37.339
gotta understand we
have a job to do.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.144
We have to check our due
diligence, you get that don't you?

28:42.113 --> 28:42.947
Yeah.

28:44.916 --> 28:45.850
I need your help.

28:48.152 --> 28:51.921
I need you to help me to
convince her to come home.

28:51.923 --> 28:54.726
Wait, what do you mean
convince her to come home?

28:55.727 --> 28:58.127
- She's still out there.
- Wait.

28:58.129 --> 29:01.030
You still think that
she's out there alive?

29:01.032 --> 29:04.335
I know she is, I talk to her.

29:08.072 --> 29:11.642
Nelson, where do
you talk to her?

29:20.752 --> 29:22.820
What do you guys think?

29:24.722 --> 29:25.556
I mean,

29:28.159 --> 29:29.925
he obviously believes in what

29:29.927 --> 29:33.464
he's seeing but he's
definitely troubled.

29:34.999 --> 29:36.465
Troubled?

29:36.467 --> 29:39.634
This guy is out of his fucking
mind, are you kidding me?

29:39.636 --> 29:42.471
Nick, you sure this
guy's reliable?

29:42.473 --> 29:44.173
- Are you shitting me?
- He seemed fine on the phone.

29:44.175 --> 29:47.476
Oh, on the phone
he seemed fine.

29:47.478 --> 29:49.311
Guys, he's not well.

29:49.313 --> 29:50.314
He's distressed.

29:52.183 --> 29:53.250
Distressed.

29:54.485 --> 29:56.051
I don't know, I think
he's hiding something.

29:56.053 --> 29:57.787
I just don't know what it is.

29:57.789 --> 30:01.490
I know what it
is, stars that bite.

30:01.492 --> 30:02.992
Stop it.

30:02.994 --> 30:07.029
I have a sixth sense about
this, this guy's fuckin' nuts.

30:07.031 --> 30:07.965
Hey, hey.

30:09.566 --> 30:13.168
This is where I usually see her.

30:13.170 --> 30:15.339
- Where, over here?
- Yeah.

30:18.142 --> 30:19.608
Okay.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.179
How long do you
normally wait for her?

30:24.715 --> 30:25.817
As long as it takes.

30:28.219 --> 30:31.787
As long as it takes,
well, we'll just wait.

30:31.789 --> 30:32.988
Got nothing else to do, right?

30:32.990 --> 30:34.423
We'll just wait as long
as it takes I guess.

30:34.425 --> 30:37.026
Today, tomorrow, it's
all the same, whatever.

30:37.028 --> 30:39.028
We gotta go, we
gotta get outta here.

30:39.030 --> 30:40.229
Jimmy stop, give him a chance.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.066
He lost his daughter,
he's distressed.

30:46.670 --> 30:51.040
We'll give it a little time
and then we'll go, okay?

30:51.042 --> 30:51.843
Casey?

30:53.811 --> 30:55.146
Casey baby, come on out.

30:58.449 --> 30:59.817
It's okay baby, come here.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.387
I've brought people
that are gonna help.

31:07.191 --> 31:08.292
I love you, baby.

31:12.629 --> 31:13.430
Casey!

31:15.833 --> 31:19.434
We gotta go,
we shouldn't push it.

31:19.436 --> 31:20.905
Come on out, baby.

31:22.373 --> 31:23.839
How much longer do
you want to stand out here?

31:23.841 --> 31:26.878
I just, I don't know
how to get him to leave.

31:28.045 --> 31:29.511
Casey I love you.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.046
I brought some people
that can help, okay baby?

31:31.048 --> 31:32.281
It's all right.

31:32.283 --> 31:33.715
Just tell
him we're leaving.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.553
Whatever it is he
thinks is out here isn't coming.

31:38.022 --> 31:39.989
Come on out baby,
daddy loves you, it's okay.

31:39.991 --> 31:40.824
Okay.

31:42.126 --> 31:42.927
Hey Nelson.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.695
- She's coming.
- I know but it's late.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.164
She's coming,
Casey it's all right baby.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.765
I'm right here, I'm right here.

31:50.767 --> 31:52.334
It's just
getting really late.

31:52.336 --> 31:53.570
Why don't we try

31:55.072 --> 31:57.506
tomorrow, okay?

31:57.508 --> 32:01.476
No I just, I want, I
want her to come out,

32:01.478 --> 32:05.948
I want her to come home but she
just, she just stands there.

32:05.950 --> 32:10.819
Okay, well we've
been out here for hours so...

32:10.821 --> 32:12.821
Casey baby,
I love you so much.

32:12.823 --> 32:14.456
Maybe we just
come back tomorrow and...

32:14.458 --> 32:16.758
- I can't do this anymore.
- Oh my god, no!

32:16.760 --> 32:19.428
No, oh my god Nelson,
Nelson please listen.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.964
Don't do that, don't
do that Nelson.

32:21.966 --> 32:23.798
- It's not gonna stop.
- But you don't know that.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.068
It's not gonna
stop, I do know.

32:26.070 --> 32:29.038
Nelson, look at me
Nelson, Nelson, Nelson, okay.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.906
Maybe I can help, okay?

32:30.908 --> 32:33.310
Hey Nelson, maybe I can help.

32:35.712 --> 32:38.247
Okay maybe I was wrong,
I was wrong earlier.

32:38.249 --> 32:41.250
Maybe I can help, can I
see the picture again?

32:41.252 --> 32:43.252
Please can I see
the picture again?

32:43.254 --> 32:46.455
- You can help?
- I think so.

32:46.457 --> 32:48.357
You can help, you
can bring her home?

32:48.359 --> 32:49.591
I need you to put
the gun down, okay?

32:49.593 --> 32:53.362
I can't, no no,
please, please Nelson.

32:53.364 --> 32:55.166
Nelson, gimme the gun.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.369
I can help if you
give me the gun, okay?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.306
No please, please no.

33:08.379 --> 33:13.215
I can't event hold this
anymore, please, please.

33:13.217 --> 33:16.318
I love you so much.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.722
I just want you to come home.

33:27.098 --> 33:28.897
Yeah I got him in
the car, we'll put him

33:28.899 --> 33:31.533
under a mandatory suicide
watch for the next 48 hours.

33:31.535 --> 33:33.602
Okay, does he have any family

33:33.604 --> 33:36.205
in the area, somebody
that could help him?

33:36.207 --> 33:38.473
No no, but we've dealt
with him in the past.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.242
He usually cools down
after a few days.

33:40.244 --> 33:43.412
- So he's done this before?
- Not to this extreme.

33:43.414 --> 33:45.047
But he's out here in the woods

33:45.049 --> 33:46.748
all the time, he's
usually drunk.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.020
He's one of our
regulars in the tank.

33:50.221 --> 33:52.221
But since you won't
be pressing charges,

33:52.223 --> 33:54.990
I think I have everything
I need from you.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.925
- Thank you, Officer.
- Thanks.

33:56.927 --> 33:58.395
- Y'all take care.
- You too.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.900
- I can't believe that.
- Yeah, I know.

34:05.902 --> 34:07.238
I got all that on camera.

34:08.905 --> 34:10.274
I did, what?

34:11.175 --> 34:12.009
What?

34:19.683 --> 34:21.284
Oh yo Nick, where's Amy?

34:25.322 --> 34:26.590
- What?
- Where's Amy?

34:27.524 --> 34:29.793
She's outside on the porch.

34:35.899 --> 34:38.132
I hate the bugs.

34:38.135 --> 34:40.502
Hey weirdo, what
are you doing?

34:40.504 --> 34:41.338
I'm

34:43.306 --> 34:45.809
just trying to wrap
my mind around today.

34:47.811 --> 34:50.246
Oh yeah, want some company?

34:51.215 --> 34:53.915
Are you my only option?

34:53.917 --> 34:56.420
Oh you're so funny, oh yeah.

35:01.092 --> 35:03.494
Let's set this thing up here.

35:07.531 --> 35:08.365
Thanks.

35:14.771 --> 35:16.571
Nah, I'm good.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.842
It's pretty much all
backwash now anyway.

35:27.118 --> 35:28.385
It's so creepy.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.655
You're like a paranormal
bloodhound or something.

35:33.557 --> 35:35.724
Do you remember
when we found that

35:35.726 --> 35:38.028
well in the woods
by grandma's house?

35:39.830 --> 35:40.664
Oh yeah.

35:41.832 --> 35:43.965
Oh yeah, I still am
trying to wrap my brain

35:43.967 --> 35:47.869
around how you convinced
me to go down there.

35:47.871 --> 35:49.838
- You were so scared.
- Yeah,

35:49.840 --> 35:54.075
I was so scared
because we got stuck

35:54.077 --> 35:57.346
in a well at night.

35:57.348 --> 36:00.751
We were like a real life episode
of Lassie, it's not funny.

36:11.195 --> 36:12.028
Oh my god.

36:16.099 --> 36:16.933
Do

36:18.034 --> 36:20.337
you remember what we saw?

36:23.006 --> 36:24.508
No one believed us.

36:27.844 --> 36:28.679
You know,

36:30.647 --> 36:33.550
sometimes I just wonder if
it's all in my head, you know?

36:35.919 --> 36:36.753
Oh my.

36:42.793 --> 36:43.694
I found something.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.266
I was reviewing some
of the footage of

36:51.268 --> 36:52.936
when we were out in
the woods with Nelson.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.069
- And?
- Put these on.

36:55.071 --> 36:57.105
- Okay.
- Okay, so you know how when

36:57.107 --> 36:59.941
he was calling for his daughter,
all we heard was crickets?

36:59.943 --> 37:02.479
- Yeah yeah, nothing at all.
- Listen to the audio.

37:08.285 --> 37:09.918
- What?
- Oh my god.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.586
- Yeah.
- What?

37:11.588 --> 37:12.889
- Here.
- Listen.

37:14.425 --> 37:15.924
- You heard it?
- Yeah.

37:15.926 --> 37:18.126
And you found this just
now reviewing the footage?

37:18.128 --> 37:21.332
- Mm hmm.
- Holy shit, are you serious?

37:22.599 --> 37:24.935
- You like that?
- Oh my god, this is insane.

37:26.136 --> 37:27.636
And it just continues
like that the whole

37:27.638 --> 37:30.772
time we were out there,
right up until we left.

37:30.774 --> 37:31.940
Can we plug this
into the camera?

37:31.942 --> 37:33.675
- Yeah man.
- Fuckin' do it.

37:33.677 --> 37:35.444
All right.

37:35.446 --> 37:38.012
All right guys, so we were
reviewing the footage from

37:38.014 --> 37:42.451
earlier today in the woods
with Nelson and we heard this.

37:42.453 --> 37:43.287
Casey.

37:46.122 --> 37:49.724
- Casey baby, come on out.
- Children.

37:49.726 --> 37:53.096
Fuckin' children
laughing in the woods

37:53.930 --> 37:56.064
the whole time.

37:56.066 --> 37:59.102
- It's okay baby, come here.
- Fuckin' unbelievable man.

38:01.204 --> 38:02.937
Hey non-believers, we are just

38:02.939 --> 38:05.440
getting warmed up,
I promise you that.

38:05.442 --> 38:07.075
- This is unreal.
- This is incredible.

38:07.077 --> 38:10.512
Yes, it's fuckin'
incredible, we found ghosts.

38:10.514 --> 38:12.914
We found some ghosts,
we're gonna be famous.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.317
I'm gonna be famous, that's
the most important part.

38:15.319 --> 38:16.353
I'm gonna be famous!

38:25.061 --> 38:30.066
What was that?

38:37.107 --> 38:37.941
Okay so,

38:40.644 --> 38:41.478
it's

38:42.513 --> 38:45.380
3:02 a.m

38:45.382 --> 38:47.217
and

38:49.320 --> 38:50.885
well,

38:50.887 --> 38:52.489
I just heard children

38:53.390 --> 38:54.858
laughing outside my window.

38:56.627 --> 38:57.461
Children.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.598
This place is fuckin'
creepy, I love it.

39:03.834 --> 39:06.169
All right, better get going.

39:12.008 --> 39:12.843
Here we go.

39:20.817 --> 39:21.652
So,

39:23.019 --> 39:24.455
it's pretty quiet now

39:26.490 --> 39:28.258
but I definitely
heard something.

39:50.714 --> 39:53.550
I swear I heard
something walking.

39:54.685 --> 39:56.687
How y'all doing tonight?

39:59.556 --> 40:00.791
- Jimmy.
- Ames?

40:03.293 --> 40:04.127
Ames?

40:05.462 --> 40:06.928
Are you out here?

40:06.930 --> 40:08.565
- Jimmy.
- What, Amy?

40:12.569 --> 40:13.404
Amy?

40:15.606 --> 40:17.173
What are you doing?

40:19.309 --> 40:20.143
Amy!

40:24.981 --> 40:26.114
Amy!

40:26.116 --> 40:26.950
Oh shit.

40:28.184 --> 40:30.253
What are you doing, Ames?

40:31.655 --> 40:33.855
What the fuck are you doing,
what are you looking at?

40:37.594 --> 40:39.663
What are you doing, your
nose Ames, are you okay?

40:40.597 --> 40:41.732
- I saw her.
- You saw who?

40:44.134 --> 40:44.935
Casey.

40:45.969 --> 40:47.170
What?

40:49.272 --> 40:50.073
Ames.

40:50.974 --> 40:52.042
Just take a seat here.

40:53.510 --> 40:54.310
Are you okay?

40:57.848 --> 40:59.614
- I'll go get Nick.
- No just,

40:59.616 --> 41:02.751
just get me a wet rag to
wipe the flood off my face.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.421
All right.

41:07.891 --> 41:11.793
Hey, how did you know the
daughter was out there anyway?

41:11.795 --> 41:13.462
I thought it was
a dream at first

41:13.464 --> 41:15.265
and then suddenly I was outside.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.800
I saw Casey and I blacked out.

41:18.802 --> 41:21.037
Nelson was right,
something else is out here.

41:25.842 --> 41:28.579
- Hey, don't tell Nick okay?
- What?

41:30.581 --> 41:31.813
Just he's got a
lot on his plate

41:31.815 --> 41:33.784
and I don't want him
to worry about me.

41:34.718 --> 41:36.217
We need to tell Nick.

41:36.219 --> 41:37.919
I mean he's gonna
see this footage...

41:37.921 --> 41:39.490
Just wait until after, okay?

41:40.657 --> 41:42.156
Every time I get like this,

41:42.158 --> 41:45.562
he freaks out and I don't
want to leave, do you?

41:46.930 --> 41:47.964
Are you kidding me?

41:50.133 --> 41:50.967
Hell no.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.607
This is it, I mean

41:57.841 --> 42:01.645
this is where we prove
that we're not crazy.

42:09.586 --> 42:11.888
You're not crazy.

42:25.301 --> 42:29.137
The camera lens and
the battery lights.

42:29.139 --> 42:30.739
There we go, check,
check, check.

42:30.741 --> 42:33.274
Got enough water and
food for three days.

42:33.276 --> 42:36.044
- Yep.
- And I have a flashlight.

42:36.046 --> 42:37.512
Let's go find ourselves a witch.

42:37.514 --> 42:38.849
Perfect, let's go.

42:50.193 --> 42:53.995
So what happens baby
sister when our show

42:53.997 --> 42:58.900
is a massive success and
the band breaks up because

42:58.902 --> 43:02.771
Nick back here can't handle
my rise in fame, what then?

43:02.773 --> 43:04.806
Is this gonna
be before or after

43:04.808 --> 43:07.043
you burn out on
drugs and booze, huh?

43:08.178 --> 43:11.212
Well if that was
to happen, it's fine.

43:11.214 --> 43:15.318
I'll just find me one of those
holistic rehab places and

43:16.753 --> 43:19.087
play with the horses and goats
and everything all day long.

43:19.089 --> 43:20.589
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

43:20.591 --> 43:23.291
Dream big baby bro, have
big goals for yourself.

43:23.293 --> 43:25.526
When are those execs sending
over the final contracts?

43:25.528 --> 43:28.765
- It's been almost two weeks.
- Yeah.

43:30.033 --> 43:31.666
Yeah their lawyers are looking

43:31.668 --> 43:33.167
over them, that's
what they said.

43:33.169 --> 43:36.137
They said that they had
to review the fine print.

43:36.139 --> 43:37.572
That's what
they told you is that

43:37.574 --> 43:40.341
they're having their lawyers
review the fine print?

43:40.343 --> 43:41.910
That's what they
said, you know

43:41.912 --> 43:43.413
how this lawyer shit goes man.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.815
No one really knows but
that's what they said.

43:46.817 --> 43:48.418
- So we'll hear something soon.
- Great.

44:22.953 --> 44:26.921
- You want Fritos, babe?
- Sure, thanks.

44:26.923 --> 44:28.591
Here you go Jimmy.

44:29.592 --> 44:30.593
Thank you.

44:33.897 --> 44:35.496
- Can I have some of that?
- Oh yeah, here.

44:35.498 --> 44:36.332
Thanks.

44:42.272 --> 44:43.606
Sun Chips, eh?

44:50.814 --> 44:52.446
Shit,

44:52.448 --> 44:53.383
shit, shit.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.151
What's wrong?

44:58.755 --> 45:00.590
I forgot my pills
back at the cabin.

45:01.591 --> 45:02.425
What?

45:04.227 --> 45:06.761
It's fine, I took
one this morning.

45:06.763 --> 45:08.730
It's just for one night,
we'll be back tomorrow.

45:08.732 --> 45:10.498
- No, we need to turn back.
- Yep, that's fine.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.432
- No, it's okay.
- No no no, fuck that.

45:11.434 --> 45:12.834
We are not going back.

45:12.836 --> 45:14.102
We've been walking for
hours, we are not going back.

45:14.104 --> 45:15.369
What if she has
another seizure

45:15.371 --> 45:16.805
out here in the
middle of nowhere?

45:16.807 --> 45:18.639
Will you guys stop please?

45:18.641 --> 45:21.175
I hate when you guys talk
about me like I'm not here

45:21.177 --> 45:26.114
and hey babe okay, I'm gonna
be fine, it's just one night.

45:26.116 --> 45:28.449
Like I said, I took
one this morning.

45:28.451 --> 45:29.951
It's fine.

45:29.953 --> 45:31.254
I've gone longer without
'em and been fine, okay?

45:32.622 --> 45:34.791
And you, thanks for looking
out for my well-being.

45:39.095 --> 45:41.029
Sorry.

45:41.031 --> 45:43.264
Yeah, I'm sorry.

45:43.266 --> 45:44.267
It's okay.

45:47.670 --> 45:50.106
I'm gonna be fine guys, okay?

46:13.396 --> 46:14.330
This is it.

47:12.155 --> 47:14.724
- Here you go.
- Ooh, thank you.

47:16.159 --> 47:17.725
All right, looks like
the GoPros are all set up

47:17.727 --> 47:20.228
and the motion capture
cameras are all ready to go

47:20.230 --> 47:23.932
around the campsite and we
have a full battery charge.

47:23.934 --> 47:26.167
Very good, let's just now hope

47:26.169 --> 47:29.005
that it doesn't turn
into another Connecticut.

47:31.007 --> 47:33.741
Temperatures dropped below
freezing like every night.

47:33.743 --> 47:34.943
Yeah that and plus

47:34.945 --> 47:37.011
we didn't get anything
the whole time.

47:37.013 --> 47:40.348
Hey, I tried to convince us
to go but you wouldn't listen.

47:40.350 --> 47:42.350
Yeah I know, I know.

47:42.352 --> 47:43.952
Let's just hope tonight's
a little different.

47:43.954 --> 47:46.422
Let's buckle up,
it's gonna be good.

47:56.066 --> 47:56.900
So it's

47:57.834 --> 47:58.668
3:00 a.m.

48:03.739 --> 48:06.910
Amy and Nick are already asleep.

48:11.781 --> 48:13.884
I haven't seen anything yet.

48:19.089 --> 48:22.425
I'm hoping tomorrow
is a different story

48:24.227 --> 48:26.829
and all this isn't for nothing.

48:45.148 --> 48:47.717
I think I just heard something.

48:54.424 --> 48:56.726
I don't know what it was but

48:59.329 --> 49:01.664
I definitely heard something.

49:04.234 --> 49:05.068
Holy shit.

49:07.870 --> 49:09.906
- What the fuck?
- Hey, we got something.

49:13.944 --> 49:15.912
- What is it?
- We're not sure yet.

49:17.513 --> 49:19.916
Motion sensor cameras
aren't picking anything up.

49:21.051 --> 49:23.151
Well all right, now
I got a picture.

49:23.153 --> 49:25.155
- Jimmy, you ready?
- Fuckin' ready, man.

49:32.128 --> 49:34.264
- Jimmy.
- Get over here.

49:35.765 --> 49:36.933
- What is it?
- Shh.

49:39.902 --> 49:44.038
Listen.

50:17.573 --> 50:18.408
Casey,

50:19.976 --> 50:21.111
Casey are you there?

50:27.450 --> 50:30.018
Casey, it's okay.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.955
We're here to help, we're
friends of your dad's.

50:38.394 --> 50:39.195
Casey?

50:45.135 --> 50:46.336
Damn, I think she's gone.

50:49.972 --> 50:51.239
Let's get this
footage uploaded to the laptop.

50:51.241 --> 50:53.574
What, I mean damn,
are you serious?

50:53.576 --> 50:56.810
Guys, she wants
to make contact.

50:56.812 --> 50:57.778
Hey Nick, how long's it gonna

50:57.780 --> 50:59.080
take to download this shit man?

50:59.082 --> 51:01.015
It should be ready
to go by morning.

51:01.017 --> 51:04.120
- I'm gonna need your SD card.
- Yeah yeah, hold on.

51:45.595 --> 51:49.530
So woke up this morning
after a great night's

51:49.532 --> 51:53.336
sleep to a little surprise
I guess you could say.

51:54.470 --> 51:57.773
These things are everywhere.

51:59.942 --> 52:01.911
I don't even know what
the fuck they are.

52:03.346 --> 52:07.515
Nick's reviewing the footage
to find out how they got here.

52:07.517 --> 52:09.783
Hopefully we'll see that but

52:09.785 --> 52:12.986
that's not the only
surprise we had.

52:12.988 --> 52:14.824
Ames, what the hell?

52:16.058 --> 52:17.325
What is this?

52:17.327 --> 52:19.760
It looks like an
upside down cross.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.464
Fuckin'
A-awesome it is.

52:22.598 --> 52:25.166
No no no, this
can't be happening.

52:25.168 --> 52:28.035
- What's going on?
- It's corrupted.

52:28.037 --> 52:28.969
- What is?
- The footage.

52:28.971 --> 52:30.671
All the footage from last night.

52:30.673 --> 52:31.507
What?

52:32.808 --> 52:35.743
- No, no, that can't be true.
- Yeah okay, okay.

52:35.745 --> 52:38.212
- Great time to joke...
- It's just black and static.

52:38.214 --> 52:39.480
Look.

52:39.482 --> 52:40.681
- Did you check both SD cards?
- Yes, I did.

52:40.683 --> 52:42.616
Wait wait wait,
what about the audio?

52:42.618 --> 52:43.817
There's nothing, it's like

52:43.819 --> 52:45.486
we didn't even turn
the cameras on.

52:45.488 --> 52:46.322
Fuck.

52:48.758 --> 52:49.957
- All right.
- Damn.

52:49.959 --> 52:50.760
All right.

52:51.961 --> 52:53.463
What's our battery
situation like?

52:55.265 --> 52:56.930
At 50%.

52:56.932 --> 52:59.233
Okay, so we can stay
out here another night.

52:59.235 --> 53:00.035
No.

53:01.204 --> 53:02.203
Why the
hell not, Nick?

53:02.205 --> 53:03.437
Amy doesn't have her meds.

53:03.439 --> 53:05.005
We don't have
enough footage, Nick.

53:05.007 --> 53:06.474
We have plenty of footage.

53:06.476 --> 53:08.242
- We can use what we got from...
- It's not fuckin' enough.

53:08.244 --> 53:09.810
- I'm telling you.
- Calm down.

53:09.812 --> 53:12.280
No listen, I'm calm, we
don't have enough Nick.

53:12.282 --> 53:14.248
Stop being a pussy,
let's stay another night.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.483
I'm not gonna
risk Amy's health

53:15.485 --> 53:16.984
for more footage, all right?

53:16.986 --> 53:18.919
We can go back to the cabin
and we'll come back out here.

53:18.921 --> 53:20.154
Oh yeah because this shit,

53:20.156 --> 53:21.422
this shit happens
all the time right?

53:21.424 --> 53:22.356
Hey, it is fine.

53:22.358 --> 53:23.957
No, it's not fuckin' fine Amy.

53:23.959 --> 53:25.261
Jimmy, what is going on?

53:27.563 --> 53:28.398
Look.

53:29.365 --> 53:30.633
The A&E contracts,

53:31.967 --> 53:34.735
they haven't been signed.

53:34.737 --> 53:38.472
Yeah because you said the
lawyers were reviewing them.

53:38.474 --> 53:41.875
No, it's because
they don't fucking exist.

53:41.877 --> 53:43.677
- What?
- Yeah.

53:43.679 --> 53:47.415
I mean the execs said that
they weren't signing off

53:47.417 --> 53:49.517
on any projects until
we got them a pilot.

53:49.519 --> 53:50.984
You said this was
a done deal, Jimmy.

53:50.986 --> 53:52.286
Yeah I know what
the fuck I said, Nick.

53:52.288 --> 53:54.655
- You lied to us?
- Yeah, I lied to us.

53:54.657 --> 53:56.089
But look we can get
this, all right?

53:56.091 --> 53:57.858
- And we can capitalize...
- You're fuckin' unbelievable!

53:57.860 --> 53:59.227
No, I'm not
fuckin' unbelievable Nick.

53:59.229 --> 54:00.694
Get off your high horse.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.162
I'm the reason we have this
opportunity in the first place...

54:02.164 --> 54:03.664
If you had told me that
this was contingent on

54:03.666 --> 54:06.133
a pilot being made, then we
could've rented this equipment

54:06.135 --> 54:08.536
instead of buying it and we
could've gotten better tents...

54:08.538 --> 54:10.538
Drag our feet, right?

54:10.540 --> 54:13.541
Drag our feet, slow down,
take our time, yeah.

54:13.543 --> 54:15.177
Okay, that's enough.

54:17.613 --> 54:21.715
Jimmy, that was really
fucked up what you did.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.218
You should have told us.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.720
Yeah, I should've
but I didn't okay?

54:26.722 --> 54:28.289
Yeah.

54:28.291 --> 54:29.492
That's where we're at.

54:30.826 --> 54:33.160
- Fuck.
- You know what, fine.

54:33.162 --> 54:34.995
I will go back to the cabin
and I will get the meds.

54:34.997 --> 54:36.830
No no no, I don't
want you going alone.

54:36.832 --> 54:38.566
- It's too dangerous.
- Okay yeah, so look.

54:38.568 --> 54:40.701
We all have a say
in this, right?

54:40.703 --> 54:41.837
Let's put it to a vote.

54:42.938 --> 54:44.472
- I say we stay.
- We need to leave.

54:44.474 --> 54:45.441
Of course you do.

54:46.742 --> 54:47.543
Ames?

54:54.584 --> 54:55.818
I think we should stay.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.994
Amy, this isn't
some easy project...

55:06.996 --> 55:09.632
I know that it's
not, hey, hey, please.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.268
I know that you're worried and

55:14.337 --> 55:16.406
I am fine.

55:18.308 --> 55:22.276
But Jimmy's right, this is the
only chance we have to prove

55:22.278 --> 55:25.047
ourselves, to prove that
we're not hacks, that I am...

55:29.419 --> 55:30.453
Please say something.

55:34.324 --> 55:35.858
This is what you want?

55:37.293 --> 55:38.127
Yes.

55:43.799 --> 55:44.800
All right.

55:45.835 --> 55:47.637
- All right.
- Thank you.

55:59.114 --> 56:00.350
Shit.

56:02.017 --> 56:02.852
Fuck.

56:06.556 --> 56:07.755
What do you
think you're doing?

56:07.757 --> 56:08.689
- Getting some water, man.
- No.

56:08.691 --> 56:09.623
Get some out of your own pack.

56:09.625 --> 56:11.058
I don't fuckin' have any, man.

56:11.060 --> 56:12.962
Then walk back to the cabin
and get some from there.

56:14.330 --> 56:16.364
- Real fuckin' mature.
- Yeah, real mature?

56:16.366 --> 56:17.831
You wanna talk about
real mature, Jimmy?

56:17.833 --> 56:20.167
How about all this shit that
you just pulled out here on us?

56:20.169 --> 56:22.636
- I said I was sorry...
- Guys please.

56:22.638 --> 56:24.073
Can we just stop?

56:25.074 --> 56:25.908
It's over.

56:31.514 --> 56:32.748
Are you okay?

56:36.519 --> 56:39.219
- Yeah, it's just my stomach.
- Do you need anything?

56:39.221 --> 56:40.588
Nick, did you get a chance to

56:40.590 --> 56:42.356
check those recorders
to make sure...

56:42.358 --> 56:45.094
Yeah they're fine Jimmy,
they were fine last night.

56:46.261 --> 56:47.428
Jeez, I don't
need an attitude.

56:47.430 --> 56:49.262
- Fuck you, Jimmy.
- There we go, blame me.

56:49.264 --> 56:50.197
- You always do.
- Yeah.

56:50.199 --> 56:51.432
Of course I'm gonna blame you.

56:51.434 --> 56:53.300
If you hadn't pulled
the shit you did,

56:53.302 --> 56:55.736
we wouldn't be in this
situation right now, all right?

56:55.738 --> 56:57.272
This is entirely your...

57:01.243 --> 57:04.680
It's okay, it's
okay, it's all right.

57:08.484 --> 57:09.719
Get it all out.

57:16.191 --> 57:17.192
You're okay.

57:21.196 --> 57:23.731
- I need to lie down.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:23.733 --> 57:24.567
Sure, sure.

57:26.869 --> 57:28.502
- Is she all right?
- You got it?

57:28.504 --> 57:29.605
Yeah.

57:33.342 --> 57:36.009
Is she okay?

57:36.011 --> 57:38.145
She's just bad off
those pills, man.

57:38.147 --> 57:41.150
Yeah it's not just the pills
man, it's this fuckin' place.

57:43.285 --> 57:45.285
Man, I'm sorry
about those contracts.

57:45.287 --> 57:46.656
I really am, it's my fault.

57:48.924 --> 57:50.493
Maybe someday you'll grow up.

58:00.470 --> 58:01.604
Here's to you, witch.

58:11.647 --> 58:12.482
Hey.

58:13.315 --> 58:15.250
Hey, did you hear that?

58:18.888 --> 58:19.722
She's here.

58:24.794 --> 58:27.561
Amy.

58:27.563 --> 58:28.998
Oh god Amy, okay.

58:49.351 --> 58:50.185
Jimmy.

58:53.422 --> 58:54.622
Is there
nothing we can do?

58:54.624 --> 58:56.759
There's nothing we
can do until it passes.

59:07.202 --> 59:08.401
It's been over an hour, man.

59:08.403 --> 59:10.339
It's never been this
long or this bad before.

59:11.841 --> 59:14.141
Maybe she just
needs some rest, you know?

59:14.143 --> 59:16.877
No, she needs her
meds, she needs her meds.

59:16.879 --> 59:19.046
- I'll go get her meds.
- You can't, man.

59:19.048 --> 59:22.883
It's like she said, it's
too dangerous to go alone.

59:22.885 --> 59:25.420
I know man
but she needs 'em,

59:27.256 --> 59:28.090
she does.

59:29.859 --> 59:31.091
You just go, you run,

59:31.093 --> 59:32.960
you don't stop for
anything all right?

59:32.962 --> 59:36.429
And then you just get those
pills and come right back here.

59:36.431 --> 59:37.667
Yeah.

59:53.683 --> 59:55.585
Fuckin' Monster Energy.

01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:16.970
Please Jimmy,
please help me.

01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:18.140
Amy?

01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:38.160
Please Jimmy,
please help me, hurry.

01:00:40.663 --> 01:00:41.731
She's coming.

01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:55.344
Come on
Jimmy, get it together.

01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:27.507
What the hell?

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:29.411
What the hell was that?

01:02:39.982 --> 01:02:42.282
Jimmy, Jimmy help.

01:02:46.756 --> 01:02:48.690
- Nick!
- Jimmy, please!

01:02:51.326 --> 01:02:52.394
Jimmy, Jimmy!

01:03:01.804 --> 01:03:02.637
Amy!

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:27.961
Nick!

01:03:27.963 --> 01:03:29.031
No, get away!

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.034
No!

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:38.238
Leave me the fuck
alone, get away!

01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:45.881
Leave me alone!

01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:00.560
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Jimmy!

01:04:00.562 --> 01:04:02.062
I need help, I need your help.

01:04:02.064 --> 01:04:03.396
- It's Nick.
- What happened?

01:04:03.398 --> 01:04:05.232
I need your help, I
can't carry him, please.

01:04:05.234 --> 01:04:07.469
Please Jimmy hurry, please!

01:04:11.106 --> 01:04:12.305
- Fuck.
- Jimmy, please.

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:14.374
- What the fuck?
- Jimmy hurry.

01:04:14.376 --> 01:04:15.544
Amy?

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:19.014
What the fuck, where's Nick?

01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:25.520
What the fuck
happened, where's Nick?

01:04:32.394 --> 01:04:35.728
You gotta be fuckin'
kiddin' me, man.

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:36.899
It's this way?

01:04:40.735 --> 01:04:41.570
Fuck.

01:04:43.272 --> 01:04:46.473
I can't see a goddamn
thing out here.

01:04:46.475 --> 01:04:47.309
Nick!

01:04:49.078 --> 01:04:50.610
Shit.

01:04:50.612 --> 01:04:52.447
This is not happening.

01:04:56.585 --> 01:04:58.487
Where the fuck is Nick?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:00.455
Fuck.

01:05:06.461 --> 01:05:07.296
Shit.

01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:11.133
Oh man, fuck, Nick, Nick!

01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:14.536
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:19.439
Oh fuck, fuck Nick no.

01:05:19.441 --> 01:05:20.275
No, Nick.

01:05:23.345 --> 01:05:25.147
What the fuck is
going on here, man?

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:30.750
What the fuck?

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:32.321
What the fuck, man?

01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:34.988
Come on, buddy.

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:37.159
What the fuck is going on?

01:05:38.727 --> 01:05:41.061
What the fuck, man?

01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:41.897
