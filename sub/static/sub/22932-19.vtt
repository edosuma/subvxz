00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:05.040 --> 00:06.540
My quinceañera
is coming up fast,

00:06.540 --> 00:09.500
so I'm all about planning
the most important stuff.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.420
My dress, my big entrance,
and of course, dessert.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.040
That's why I've created...

00:16.040 --> 00:17.880
the Sweets 16.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.460
Each dessert squares off
with another

00:19.460 --> 00:21.380
until there's only one left.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.710
We'll see who takes the cake.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.250
Not that I'm giving an unfair
endorsement to cake.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.580
-Harley!
-Whoa! Ellie!

00:28.580 --> 00:30.960
I didn't know you were coming
back from school this weekend.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.710
I have a big video project
due for filmmaking class.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.500
Are you making
desserts fight?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.960
Stay focused, Ellie!

00:37.960 --> 00:39.500
If I don't get an A on this,

00:39.500 --> 00:41.580
I'll have to stay over
break and redo it.

00:41.580 --> 00:42.750
Oh, that's a bummer.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.500
Listen, crepes or peach cobbler,
head to head, who wins?

00:46.500 --> 00:49.540
Break is during your party.
I'll miss your quinceañera.

00:49.540 --> 00:50.380
What?

00:50.380 --> 00:52.540
But my bestie
has to be there.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.380
I figured my best shot
to ace this project

00:54.380 --> 00:57.080
was to make it about something
I know really well.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.120
So I talked my teacher
into letting me

00:59.120 --> 01:00.380
come home to film...

01:00.380 --> 01:04.620
Harley Diaz,
Genius Girl Inventor!

01:04.620 --> 01:06.170
I'll give you an A
for the title.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.420
[laughs]

01:07.420 --> 01:08.960
Ellie, you're back!

01:08.960 --> 01:11.540
No time for chitchat.
We've got a video to make.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.710
Hey, are you busy?

01:12.710 --> 01:14.460
I can be camera-ready
in 10 minutes.

01:14.460 --> 01:17.670
No, I need you and Dad to choose
the dessert for my quince.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.670
Even better.
It took 18 years,

01:19.670 --> 01:21.500
but finally one of our kids
gave us a job we'll enjoy.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.540
[laughs]

01:23.540 --> 01:25.000
[sighs]

01:25.000 --> 01:26.710
Do you think I'm going
to get an A on this Harley?

01:26.710 --> 01:28.500
It'll be easy as pie.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.210
Ooh, pie.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.540
Mom, add pie to the chart.

01:32.540 --> 01:34.670
Okay, let's do this.

01:34.670 --> 01:37.170
And that's why I converted
this boxing dummy

01:37.170 --> 01:38.460
into the Robo-Roper.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.670
For him, swinging ropes
was a big upgrade

01:40.670 --> 01:42.080
from being hit
in the face.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.580
You never did thank me
for that, by the way.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.540
[no audio]

01:47.540 --> 01:48.620
It is a vacuum...

01:48.620 --> 01:51.670
[no audio]

01:51.670 --> 01:52.620
...louder than your phone...

01:52.620 --> 01:54.920
How did I invent
the H-2-Whoa?

01:54.920 --> 01:56.710
I asked myself,

01:56.710 --> 01:58.880
what's the best way
for a concertgoer

01:58.880 --> 02:00.670
to get sunscreen
and glitter?

02:00.670 --> 02:02.960
Because who says you can't
be skin-safe and glam

02:02.960 --> 02:05.000
at the same time?

02:06.670 --> 02:07.540
I think we should cut.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.540
Sorry, I was just
picturing myself

02:09.540 --> 02:11.620
using the H-2-Whoa
at a concert.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.750
Why are you on the floor?

02:14.750 --> 02:16.170
[sighs]

02:16.170 --> 02:18.040
This is worse
than I thought.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.580
If Ellie needs a good grade
to come to my quince,

02:20.580 --> 02:22.540
she'll never make it.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.670
Despite me looking
at the ceiling,

02:24.670 --> 02:26.580
things are not looking up.

about your first invention

was absolutely perfect.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.830
Sorry I didn't realize
the battery ran out.

03:26.830 --> 03:30.080
At least this time
you put it in.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.830
I'm going to miss
your quince.

03:32.830 --> 03:35.170
If only you could be in front
of the camera and behind it.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.620
What if you do your project
on someone else?

03:37.620 --> 03:39.080
I can't.
For the last two weeks,

03:39.080 --> 03:41.670
I've been selling
my teacher on...

03:41.670 --> 03:44.670
Harley Diaz,
Genius Girl Inventor.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.290
But he doesn't know
what I look like.

03:49.710 --> 03:51.620
Oh, hi, guys.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.040
Hey, Genius Girl Inventor.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.750
[clears throat]

03:59.750 --> 04:02.880
Ethan, Ethan,
you're a busy guy.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.290
You can't be troubled
with making your own sandwich.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.830
You need to hire...

04:06.830 --> 04:09.670
[all]
A Little Help.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.920
To touch my food?
I don't think so.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.830
Come on, we've run
into some unexpected debt.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.620
Poopy and Goon invited us
to their party,

04:17.620 --> 04:20.290
and now they say we owe them
$10 for the cake and drinks.

04:20.290 --> 04:23.120
What? It's an understood
social contract

04:23.120 --> 04:25.080
that refreshments are free
at a party.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.250
That's kind of the "party"
part of party.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.250
Poopy and Goon
make their own rules.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.920
Now we need 10 bucks
to get them off our backs.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.000
Tell them I said
to stop messing with you,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.670
or they'll hear
from your big brother.

04:35.670 --> 04:36.710
[all laugh]

04:38.080 --> 04:39.330
That's adorable.

04:39.330 --> 04:40.830
But these guys
will stop at nothing

04:40.830 --> 04:42.120
until we give them
what they want.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.750
Boy, it's weird to be
on the other end of that.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.880
Nice call smuggling these
goodies up here in a suitcase

04:53.880 --> 04:55.710
to keep them away
from the kids.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.710
I hope the brownies
don't taste like sneaker.

04:57.710 --> 04:58.880
I put them
in the shoe holders.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.880
[sniffs]

05:02.670 --> 05:03.880
You know, when Harley
first asked us

05:03.880 --> 05:05.920
to narrow down her quince
dessert, I was excited.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.250
But now, knowing I have to eat
16, it's kind of intimidating.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.750
Even for me.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.210
Oh, we don't have
to eat all of them.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.960
I mean, chocolate chip cookies
vs. rice pudding, that's easy.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.250
The obvious winner is...

05:15.250 --> 05:16.880
-rice pudding.
-Chocolate chip cookies.

05:18.290 --> 05:21.710
Come on, cookies have a whole
aisle in the supermarket.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.880
Rice pudding is on the bottom
dairy shelf

05:23.880 --> 05:26.040
next to cottage cheese,
where it belongs.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.710
Try it.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.960
It looks like something
you wipe off a baby's face.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.790
Whoa! This is delicious!

05:36.790 --> 05:37.790
Mm-hmm.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.830
I guess we can't count
anybody out.

05:39.830 --> 05:42.290
[sighs]
We've got 16 contenders.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.120
I'd better go put on
my pregnancy jeans.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.080
Thank you so much
for being me.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.330
And just a note,
I carry my invention bag

05:51.330 --> 05:53.040
on my other shoulder.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.170
You're so nitpicky.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.920
I'll use that.

05:56.920 --> 06:01.000
And now, my next invention
is the Pick-Me-Up.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.080
The Pick-Me-Up
does a lot.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.380
Whoa!

06:03.380 --> 06:05.750
Right now,
we have popcorn on the floor,

06:05.750 --> 06:06.750
and it's got to pick it up.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.000
That's its job.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.830
Hello, I'm Harley,

06:09.830 --> 06:12.040
and this is my invention,
the Floor Finder.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.750
Picks up a lot of stuff.

06:13.750 --> 06:16.880
Everyone will really like it,
and it's just fabulous.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.830
This is what I like to call
the Laundry Me.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.920
I love this invention, because
if you don't know how to fold,

06:22.920 --> 06:24.830
this is the invention for you.

06:24.830 --> 06:26.750
We live in a house
full of many messy people

06:26.750 --> 06:28.880
who need assistance
in folding.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.040
This will do the trick.

06:32.710 --> 06:33.710
[sighs]

06:33.710 --> 06:35.170
I don't want
to jinx anything,

06:35.170 --> 06:37.880
mostly because my mom
forbids jinxing,

06:37.880 --> 06:39.880
but I think we got
some great footage.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.210
My bestie came through again.

06:41.210 --> 06:44.120
It was all you.
I just got the ball rolling.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.920
You know, once those directing
juices started flowing,

06:47.920 --> 06:50.210
it actually was kind of easy.

06:51.330 --> 06:52.960
Easy for her.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.250
I ran a collision course

06:54.250 --> 06:56.210
and nearly broke my thumb
catching the camera.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.920
But it was worth it,

06:57.920 --> 07:00.750
because Ellie's going to be
at my quince.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.790
And I actually do think
she got better along the way,

07:02.790 --> 07:04.420
so everyone's a winner.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.250
Ow!

07:07.330 --> 07:09.120
[drone buzzing]

07:11.920 --> 07:13.290
What the...?

07:15.830 --> 07:17.040
[Ethan screams]

07:19.170 --> 07:21.460
Ooh. Mustard drone.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.380
That's Poopy and Goon's
calling card.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.880
"We want $10 now."

07:27.880 --> 07:30.120
Wow. Yellow and brown.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.210
Those guys really go
the extra mile.

07:32.210 --> 07:34.250
What's going on?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.250
Ooh, mustard drone.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.500
Makes sense.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.250
We told Poopy and Goon
you said not to pay.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.330
That's it.
I'm confronting these jokers.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.330
Regular mustard is one thing,

07:46.330 --> 07:48.170
spicy brown
is over the line.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.880
[sighs]

07:51.880 --> 07:52.880
You're a natural.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.920
You're definitely
getting an A.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.500
Hey, I've been thinking
about what special gift

07:57.500 --> 08:00.080
to get you for your quince,
and now I know.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.380
I'll be your videographer.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.040
You want to film
my quince?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.380
The party I've been planning
my entire life

08:07.380 --> 08:09.790
and definitely, definitely
want to show my children?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.170
And my children.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.960
They'll be watching it
together.

08:14.210 --> 08:18.210
You know, that is such
a nice offer,

08:18.210 --> 08:20.960
but you've gotten so good,
I can't ask a filmmaker like you

08:20.960 --> 08:23.120
to do a silly birthday party.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.500
Plus, there's no way
I could afford you.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.290
Oh, you don't have to.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.500
It's a gift.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.540
A gift I would like
to return.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.210
What am I going to do?

08:37.210 --> 08:39.040
I am not going to help Ellie
do the video

08:39.040 --> 08:40.460
while you play me
at my quince.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.460
So tell her she can't do it.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.460
And break her heart?
Come on, Georgie.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.000
So let her do it.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.500
And have it turn out awful?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.460
She'll feel horrible
she messed it up.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.540
And 10 times worse
she let me down.

08:51.540 --> 08:55.580
You know, helping you
is a lot of work.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.330
And so is filming a quince.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.420
I'm surprised
she'd even want to do it.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.080
What if she doesn't?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.880
What if she realizes
how hard it will be

09:07.880 --> 09:09.040
and decides not to
on her own?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.380
This is going to take
the rest of my day, isn't it?

09:17.210 --> 09:18.830
[sniffs]

09:18.830 --> 09:20.330
I smell skunk.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.080
Do you smell skunk?

09:22.080 --> 09:25.080
That's me.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.920
I went to the address you gave
me for Poopy and Goon's house,

09:27.920 --> 09:30.500
and before I got to the door,
I was stink-bombed.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.620
[coughs]
Ooh, those have bite.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.580
And when I got back
to my bike to escape,

09:34.580 --> 09:37.380
instead of my pedals,
I found these.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.460
[Daphne]
"10 dollars."

09:41.460 --> 09:44.580
Ooh, with frowny faces
on the O's.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.540
-They mean business.
-Mm-hmm.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.040
Better pay up. Stink bombs
are Poopy and Goon playing nice.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.920
Please end this while you still
have a nose to smell through.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.920
No. This is way too much.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.880
We're going to war.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.960
Right after I take
a scented bath.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.500
Use Mom and Dad's tub!

10:05.920 --> 10:07.960
Harley wants to hire
A Little Help.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.920
How much to make filming
a quince seem impossible?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.960
-Why does she--?
-Shh! Ten dollars.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.500
-Done.
-[all] Yes!

10:17.250 --> 10:19.040
[Suzy]
And the winner is...

10:19.040 --> 10:21.120
chocolate fudge cake.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.750
You got to hand it
to the lemon bar, though.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.330
It made it much further
than anyone thought.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.920
It's the Cinderella story
of this bracket.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.380
We'd better go
and tell Harley

10:29.380 --> 10:31.620
before my stomach realizes
what's headed its way.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.040
Oh, you've got a little fudge
on your shirt.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.960
Oh, that's going to stain.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.120
Wouldn't have happened
with the macaroons.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.120
Hold on.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.960
We didn't even consider
the stain factor.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.420
Harley's a scientist.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.000
She wouldn't have needed
a bracket

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
if it was as simple
as tasting.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.540
She believes
in full analysis.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.080
You're right.
Full analysis.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.120
Like, what would be slippery
if it got on the dance floor?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.920
Sure, flan's tasty,

10:55.920 --> 10:58.080
but it's also a broken ankle
waiting to happen.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.790
Reset the board.

10:59.790 --> 11:04.040
We need to redo the dessert
bracket in the name of science.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.710
Got a pair of pregnancy jeans
I could borrow?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.670
[exhales]

11:07.670 --> 11:11.040
Any quince is
an overwhelming experience,

11:11.040 --> 11:13.210
but a Diaz quince
is on a whole nother level.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.960
I want you to do great,

11:14.960 --> 11:18.040
so I set up something
to help you practice.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.620
Welcome to my...

11:19.620 --> 11:21.120
fake-ceañera.

11:22.540 --> 11:25.710
All right.
Remember, make sure to capture

11:25.710 --> 11:26.920
all the really big moments.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.120
I got this.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.040
Oh, the Easter Bunny's DJing.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.420
Fun.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.170
Oh, the headphones
are for show.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.170
His ears are too big.

11:37.170 --> 11:38.670
Don't worry.

11:38.670 --> 11:41.620
I'll be here for you
the whole way.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.040
Oh, here I come.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.580
I'm Harley,

11:46.580 --> 11:50.000
and I'm going to make
my entrance into the room.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.250
Hello, I am great Uncle Mario
from Omaha.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.080
You ever been to Nebraska?

11:55.080 --> 11:58.670
I've got many boring stories
about Nebraska.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.880
You missed the quince girl's
entrance.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.540
But don't worry,
you got this.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.960
I believe in you, Ellie.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.210
Oh, here comes Dad
with a speech.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.460
You have to get that.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.040
I am Dad Diaz.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.210
I wanted to be Harley,
but Georgie got that.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.380
Fake sandwiches!

12:13.380 --> 12:18.250
Get your tiny
fake sandwiches!

12:18.250 --> 12:20.580
Ellie, you're missing
the doll presentation!

12:20.580 --> 12:23.170
I'm missing everything!

12:25.040 --> 12:26.790
You know what I miss?

12:26.790 --> 12:28.170
Nebraska.

12:28.170 --> 12:30.250
Home of the Reuben sandwich.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.250
[laughs]

12:36.380 --> 12:38.170
What's wrong with s'mores?

12:38.170 --> 12:39.790
Really? S'mores?

12:39.790 --> 12:42.790
The dessert that's cooked
over an open flame?

12:42.790 --> 12:44.330
Oh! You're right.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.790
We'll burn down the venue.

12:45.790 --> 12:48.210
We'd have to do the family dance
in the parking lot.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.330
We're driving
ourselves crazy.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.170
Harley may be a scientist,

12:51.170 --> 12:54.080
but we fly by the seat
of our pregnancy pants,

12:54.080 --> 12:55.960
and it's worked out
just fine.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
Let's just pick something
at random.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.830
Yeah, it's a dessert for
a 15-year-old's birthday party.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.250
[scoffs]

13:02.250 --> 13:04.040
Cupcakes.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.040
Perfect.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.330
It's got cake,
frosting and sprinkles.

13:07.330 --> 13:10.250
That is three out of the four
dessert groups.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.620
Sold. Let's go tell Harley.

13:12.620 --> 13:13.880
[Harley]
Hey, don't miss this.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.040
Harley's doing
the big family dance.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.580
Fake crab cake?

13:19.330 --> 13:22.080
My quince is the most
important day of my life.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.250
Get the big moments, don't just
pick something at random.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.000
-Round three?
-Yup.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.330
Fake crab cake?

13:35.330 --> 13:37.210
Uncle Mario's
making a toast!

13:37.210 --> 13:40.040
Let me start with the day
Harley was born.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.580
No, let me start
before that.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.040
[laughs]

13:44.040 --> 13:45.120
Fake crab cake?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.330
[Harley] Dad's having
an emotional moment!

13:47.330 --> 13:50.080
This is so beautiful.
I am crying.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.380
I can't!

13:57.380 --> 13:59.250
[sighs]

13:59.250 --> 14:01.620
This is way harder
than I thought.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.420
If I can't film
a fake-ceañera,

14:03.420 --> 14:05.580
there's no way I'm ready
for the real one.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.210
Sorry.

14:07.210 --> 14:09.000
Don't be sorry.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.710
You gave your best shot.

14:10.710 --> 14:12.290
That's all that matters.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.710
I need to go home and put on
some fuzzy slippers.

14:14.710 --> 14:17.380
Which kind of remind me
of that scary bunny.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.420
I'll go put on
something else.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.710
A Little Help's work here
is done.

14:25.710 --> 14:27.290
Could we use you
as a reference

14:27.290 --> 14:29.830
if anyone else wants to crush
their best friend's dream?

14:31.080 --> 14:34.250
You make it sound like
I did something bad.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.000
So...

14:37.000 --> 14:40.290
is that a yes or a no
on the reference?

14:45.460 --> 14:48.580
I hope this is the last time
I need to play you today.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.960
I'm so deep inside your head,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.540
I'm starting to think
of inventions.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.080
Electric spoon.
Is that something?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.250
I should write that down.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.330
I'm not 100% proud
of the fake-ceañera,

15:00.330 --> 15:03.210
but at least Ellie's over
the idea of being videographer

15:03.210 --> 15:04.540
at my real one.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.500
And for once, A Little Help
was actually a lot of help.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.120
Don't tell them I said that.
They'll want more money.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.000
Hey.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.920
I thought about it,

15:14.920 --> 15:16.880
and I feel bad I quit
as your videographer,

15:16.880 --> 15:19.540
especially after
you helped me do my project.

15:19.540 --> 15:23.250
I helped, you quit,
who's keeping score?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.500
I am.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.330
Never give up.
I learned that from you.

15:27.330 --> 15:28.960
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.120
That doesn't sound like me.
Are you sure?

15:32.120 --> 15:33.290
It's you.

15:33.290 --> 15:35.330
And, with your inspiration,

15:35.330 --> 15:37.250
I cut together some footage
from the fake-ceañera,

15:37.250 --> 15:39.380
so you'll see the kind of job
I'll do at your real one.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.040
I'm back in.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.250
Can we get our $10 now?

15:45.250 --> 15:46.830
Not now. Go!

15:46.830 --> 15:48.540
We'll go when you give us
our 10 bucks.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.380
Fine.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.750
-Go.
-[door closes]

15:53.750 --> 15:56.620
Wait, are you giving them
$10 to pay off Poopy and Goon?

15:56.620 --> 15:58.620
I said we're not doing that.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.210
Hey.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.750
We earned that
for messing with Ellie

16:01.750 --> 16:03.960
so she wouldn't want
to film Harley's quince.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.750
What?

16:08.080 --> 16:09.670
I...

16:09.670 --> 16:11.380
I thought you were going
to have my back,

16:11.380 --> 16:13.290
not stab me in it.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.380
I did it for you!

16:17.380 --> 16:18.540
[door closes]

16:19.880 --> 16:21.290
Hey, that's ours!

16:21.290 --> 16:22.620
Not anymore.

16:25.170 --> 16:26.960
Thanks for blowing it
with Harley.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.380
We could've paid off
Poopy and Goon

16:28.380 --> 16:29.380
and been done with this.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.620
If you pay a bully,

16:30.620 --> 16:32.330
they're just going
to do it again.

16:32.330 --> 16:33.330
It's time to teach
bad people

16:33.330 --> 16:35.540
they can't take advantage
of good ones.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.080
I've laid out
a series of traps.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.330
[Lewie]
Broccoli marshmallows.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.830
TP balls soaked in fruit punch.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.380
Gravy hose.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.500
This is top-notch work.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.000
But wouldn't it just be easier
to pay the $10?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.330
Besides, you ever clean
marshmallow off a gravy hose?

16:55.330 --> 16:56.670
It's messy.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.920
Just get Poopy and Goon
over here.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.330
They're going to go straight
for this fake $10 bill,

17:04.330 --> 17:06.460
which is right
in the danger zone.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.330
Once they grab it,

17:08.330 --> 17:09.460
we are going to unleash

17:09.460 --> 17:12.170
a refrigerator's worth of terror
upon them...

17:13.460 --> 17:17.000
with the simple push
of a button.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.380
Is that the button
that shoots rainbows

17:18.380 --> 17:20.460
in the Snoozleberry
board game?

17:20.460 --> 17:22.540
No. It's the button
that shoots rainbows

17:22.540 --> 17:24.580
in the Snoozleberry
board game,

17:24.580 --> 17:26.880
with a skull sticker on it.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.210
Ellie's not answering her phone
or her door.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.170
Can't say I blame her.

17:37.460 --> 17:38.960
But if she had filmed
my quince,

17:38.960 --> 17:41.000
she would have messed it up
and felt even worse.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.500
Yeah, I know I keep
saying that,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.830
but I have to remind myself
why I did this.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.790
And if I ever start
to doubt myself,

17:49.790 --> 17:52.120
I could just watch
the fake-ceañera video she made.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.880
I'm sure it's terrible.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.500
[Ellie]
Harley's fake-ceañera.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.080
The party may have been fake,

18:05.080 --> 18:08.460
but when it comes to friends,
Harley's the real thing.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.500
You're going to crush
this next part.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.580
But don't worry,
you got this.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.460
I believe in you, Ellie.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.500
I'll be here for you
the whole way.

18:16.500 --> 18:20.080
[Ellie]
Harley put together this whole
practice run just to help me,

18:20.080 --> 18:22.000
which is why I want
to pay her back

18:22.000 --> 18:23.500
and film her real--

18:27.620 --> 18:30.000
Oh, I forgot to tell you
about my last trap.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.670
It's called "the final blow."

18:34.670 --> 18:37.500
You see, I was trying
to think of a secret weapon

18:37.500 --> 18:40.040
to beat Poopy and Goon
at their own game.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.670
And there's no better
ammunition

18:41.670 --> 18:44.670
than what you find
under Lewie and Beast's beds.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.960
Sadly, I didn't find
a weapon.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.040
But I did uncover
a secret.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
Suddenly, it all
made sense.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.830
Poopy and Goon didn't
do all that stuff to me.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.670
You did.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.290
The mustard attack.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.580
-[wet explosion]
-[Ethan screams]

19:11.580 --> 19:13.540
The stink bombs.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.000
-[loud pop]
-[Ethan] Ah! Ah! Ah!

19:17.120 --> 19:18.960
My poor, poor bike.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.250
You have quite
the imagination.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.750
Do I? Because I found
something else under your bed.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.210
Your yearbook.

19:36.580 --> 19:39.620
Poopy and Goon.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.580
Class pets.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.880
Game over.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.710
Okay, okay, fine.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.710
We made up Poopy and Goon
to get what we want.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.790
Extra cake at a birthday party?
Poopy and Goon need a slice.

19:56.790 --> 19:57.710
Don't want to do chores?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.670
Sorry, playdate
with Poopy and Goon.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.670
Need $10 for a dinosaur tooth?

20:02.670 --> 20:05.710
Tell your brother you owe
Poopy and Goon money.

20:05.710 --> 20:07.670
It's just what people do.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.670
No, it's not what people do.

20:09.670 --> 20:13.210
Luckily, I outplayed you
to get to this very moment.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.790
Oh? This moment?

20:14.790 --> 20:17.880
When we're about to spring
all your traps on you?

20:17.880 --> 20:19.920
We have the button.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.290
And you're in the danger zone.

20:21.290 --> 20:22.880
Goodbye, brother.

20:24.620 --> 20:25.750
[button buzzes]

20:31.170 --> 20:32.710
No.

20:32.710 --> 20:34.830
This moment,
where I reveal

20:34.830 --> 20:35.880
that that's not
the real button,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.790
and this isn't the real
danger zone.

20:40.670 --> 20:41.750
Like I said,

20:41.750 --> 20:42.920
it's time to teach
bad people

20:42.920 --> 20:45.960
that they can't take advantage
of good ones.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.960
[all scream]

21:06.830 --> 21:07.830
Aww.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.620
It looks like you guys
could use...

21:09.620 --> 21:11.750
A Little Help.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.750
I wanted to make sure
you opened the door.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.880
But I do have something
to deliver.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
An apology.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.210
I'm really sorry.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.830
I watched the video.

21:34.830 --> 21:37.080
You made a real jerk
look like a good friend.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.880
And anyone
that talented

21:39.880 --> 21:41.830
is more than qualified
to film my big day.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.880
Not that you'd want to anymore.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.710
I don't.

21:47.710 --> 21:49.380
Figured.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.790
You're still mad at me.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.920
Okay, well...

21:54.920 --> 21:55.920
[sighs]

21:55.920 --> 21:56.920
No.

22:00.330 --> 22:03.290
The fake-ceañera actually
did teach me something.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.000
If I'm behind the camera,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.290
I won't be a part of anything
that's happening in front of it

22:10.290 --> 22:13.040
with my best friend.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.880
[Harley]  Doing the right thing
isn't always easy.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.960
Sometimes it means making
the right decision.

22:20.330 --> 22:22.880
I think I've finally realized
how to make sure

22:22.880 --> 22:24.790
Harley gets
the perfect dessert.

22:24.790 --> 22:27.330
Get them all so we don't
have to pick?

22:27.330 --> 22:28.790
Dessert table it is.

22:28.790 --> 22:31.830
Sometimes it means
teaching the right lesson.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.830
What happened here?

22:37.830 --> 22:39.710
You will never
believe this.

22:42.170 --> 22:43.710
Poopy and Goon!

22:44.790 --> 22:46.120
[all giggle]

22:46.120 --> 22:47.920
Ugh, they're the worst.

22:50.380 --> 22:52.210
Thank you, Ethan.

22:52.210 --> 22:53.710
You're welcome.

22:54.830 --> 22:56.250
Now that'll be $10.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.040
[all laugh]

22:58.040 --> 22:59.790
All right,
back to work.

22:59.790 --> 23:02.880
-[all shouting]
-[Harley]  And sometimes...

23:02.880 --> 23:04.830
it means learning a lesson you
should have known all along.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.380
I could do something else
special for your quince.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.960
I've been taking
sewing lessons at school.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.210
I could make your dress.

23:11.210 --> 23:13.040
Friends matter most.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.420
That sounds great.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.830
-I'm kidding.
-Oh, thank goodness.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.040
[laughs]

23:20.880 --> 23:22.960
[both laugh]
