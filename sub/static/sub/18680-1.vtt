"We wove a web in childhood,
A web of sunny air.

00:07.958 --> 00:11.599
"We dug a spring in infancy
Of water pure and fair.

00:11.599 --> 00:13.640
"We sowed in youth a mustard seed,

00:13.640 --> 00:15.238
"We cut an almond rod;

00:16.320 --> 00:20.440
"We're now grown up to riper age -
Are they withered in the sod?

00:20.440 --> 00:23.719
"Are they blighted failed and faded,

00:23.719 --> 00:25.839
"Are they moulded back to clay?

00:25.839 --> 00:30.719
"For life is darkly shaded;
And its joys fleet fast away."

00:32.240 --> 00:33.679
What the hell is going on?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.560
Qui sont ces gens?!

00:38.560 --> 00:41.439
They'll tear us limb from limb.

00:41.439 --> 00:43.920
I've crossed the Arctic
and seen nothing like it.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.920
Down on them! Instantly! Run!

00:48.640 --> 00:52.439
Know you that I give into your
protection - but not for your own -

00:52.439 --> 00:55.359
these mortals whom
you hold in your hands.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.838
What's yours called? Wellesley.
This is Gravey.

00:58.838 --> 01:00.799
Because he looks a bit grave.
Mine's called...

01:00.799 --> 01:04.038
Waiting Boy. Is it? Why?

01:04.038 --> 01:07.879
Because he's a queer looking little
thing, Anne. Much like yourself.

01:07.879 --> 01:11.598
Look who's talking. This is Sneaky.

01:11.598 --> 01:15.158
Thou art under my protection.
I will watch over thy life,

01:15.158 --> 01:19.639
for I tell you all - one day...
you shall be kings.

01:19.639 --> 01:21.118

"Dear Ellen.
It was ten o'clock when I got home.

02:05.479 --> 02:06.718
"I found Branwell ill.

02:07.838 --> 02:11.319
"He is so very often these days,
owing to his own fault.

02:11.319 --> 02:14.599
"I was not therefore surprised at
first, but when Anne informed me of

02:14.599 --> 02:18.438
"the immediate cause of his present
illness, I was greatly shocked."

02:22.879 --> 02:25.640
Charlotte! How was the journey?
Pleasant.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.998
How was Miss Nussey? Well.

02:27.998 --> 02:29.159
Did my box arrive safely?

02:29.159 --> 02:32.998
In our room, we took it up,
me and Emily. What's...? Branwell.

02:32.998 --> 02:36.319
He's been drinking.
He's had a letter. From Mr Robinson.

02:36.319 --> 02:39.879
This last Thursday.
He's been dismissed.

02:39.879 --> 02:42.080
How does he do it?

02:42.080 --> 02:46.920
It's every job he's ever had.
I know, but this is different. How?

02:46.920 --> 02:50.319
Nothing was spelled out
in the letter. But he...

02:51.599 --> 02:52.998
Him and Mrs Robinson...

02:54.200 --> 02:56.718
I had reason to know
that they were...

02:56.718 --> 02:58.080
carrying on.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.879
With one another. And I don't know,
I can only assume,

03:00.879 --> 03:03.960
that Mr Robinson's found out,
and that's what it's about.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.278
Carrying on? How?

03:07.480 --> 03:10.920
Congress? Mr Robinson's wife?

03:10.920 --> 03:14.800
It's why I resigned.
I couldn't look people in the face.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
I've known for months.
Papa doesn't know.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.278
He just knows he's been dismissed,

03:18.278 --> 03:20.118
he doesn't know why.
Emily does. I told her.

03:20.118 --> 03:23.599
And of course we don't know
that IS the reason. Where is Emily?

03:23.599 --> 03:26.438
You must have some idea
what this is about!

03:26.438 --> 03:28.960
You think repeating the question
enough times, over and over,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.760
is suddenly going to make me
able to answer it?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.520
And if not then someone
must write to the man

03:32.520 --> 03:34.599
and ask for an explanation!

03:34.599 --> 03:38.200
He hates me! He's not going
to give any kind of an explanation.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.920
It's an excuse to get rid of me!

03:40.920 --> 03:45.599
He's a monster, he's a bully, he's
a law unto himself. He's an idiot.

03:45.599 --> 03:49.319
Why does he hate you? Why does
he need a reason to get rid of you?

03:49.319 --> 03:53.399
Because he's old, he's ill
and he's jealous of me!

03:53.399 --> 03:56.118
No, no, no.
That doesn't make any sense!

03:56.118 --> 03:58.800
There must have been
a misunderstanding.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.998
Has someone misrepresented you
to him?

04:00.998 --> 04:03.200
Just... GOD!

04:03.200 --> 04:08.438
This HOUSE! Just go to bed and stop
asking me fucking questions!

04:08.438 --> 04:10.399
If you don't like this house,
don't stay in it.

04:10.399 --> 04:12.879
There's none of us'll miss you,
not when you're like this.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.079
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!

04:17.920 --> 04:19.480
Tell him.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.680
Branwell's been at it.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.480
With his employer's wife.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.079
She was lonely.

04:29.759 --> 04:31.800
She was lonely!

course of myopic self-destruction,

for I imagine you and I might -
under better circumstances -

04:47.800 --> 04:51.319
have made very stimulating
company for one another!

04:51.319 --> 04:55.840
I despise everything you stand for!
Revolution is in the air!

04:55.840 --> 04:59.400
Only a fool like you, sir,
would ignore it!

05:01.240 --> 05:03.959
If the parson and your Aunt Branwell
were in,

05:03.959 --> 05:06.240
you'd noan make so much din!

has happened in Ireland.

the advice given them,

05:41.999 --> 05:45.119
"of abstaining from processions..."

05:45.119 --> 05:48.040
Yeah, I'm just...

"..conducting themselves

05:58.119 --> 06:00.920
Don't get up.
No, no. I'd like to see him.

06:05.519 --> 06:08.439
How are you today, John?
I'm very well, thank you, Mr Bronte.

06:08.439 --> 06:10.040
Good, good.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.400
Well, travel safely.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.600
Picked a fine day for it, eh?

06:18.559 --> 06:20.639
You, er, look after yourself.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.319
Thank you.

06:36.639 --> 06:37.920
Well...

06:37.920 --> 06:44.680
I think, with kindness
and understanding and prayer,

06:44.680 --> 06:47.400
we might still be able...

06:47.400 --> 06:52.759
in spite of his naivety
and...his nonsense...

06:54.999 --> 06:57.800
..be able to get him back
onto a proper path.

06:59.199 --> 07:01.800
Will you bring us all something
back from Liverpool, Father?

07:01.800 --> 07:04.639
You behave yersen.
And then we'll see.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.360
You dozy bastard.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.840
Getting caught.

07:21.079 --> 07:26.119
"Anne left her situation at Thorp
Green of her own accord, June 1845.

07:26.119 --> 07:27.720

"We are all in decent health
only that Papa

"has a complaint in his eyes

07:34.280 --> 07:37.160
"who I hope will be better

"I am seldom more ever troubled

07:40.720 --> 07:44.119
"and merely desiring that everybody
could be as comfortable as myself

07:44.119 --> 07:45.840
"and as undesponding of them,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.319
"we should have
a very tolerable world of it."

07:50.319 --> 07:51.720
They've set off.

07:53.199 --> 07:55.559
Good. Call me old-fashioned,

07:55.559 --> 07:58.720
but I think it's nice
having everybody back at home.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.319
In theory. What happened?

08:03.319 --> 08:06.360
You heard the shouting.
I had my pillow over my ears

08:06.360 --> 08:09.920
so I didn't catch the details.
Lucky you.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.680
So he's...been mucking about,

08:12.680 --> 08:14.119
and by way of punishment,

08:14.119 --> 08:16.920
he's packed off on holiday
for a week with Martha's father?

08:16.920 --> 08:19.840
Packed off on holiday for a week,
or got shot off for a few days.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.680
It's all a question of
how you might choose to look at it.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.079
Tabby. Well, if that's how you feel.

08:48.198 --> 08:50.958
Do you still write stories?
Sometimes.

08:52.558 --> 08:53.639
About Gondal?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.198
When we can.

08:57.919 --> 09:01.478
Emily as well? You've been here
with her more than I have, surely.

09:01.478 --> 09:03.358
We never talk about it.
Never?

09:16.198 --> 09:18.238
Do you? Write?

09:18.238 --> 09:20.238
Still? Not so much.

09:20.238 --> 09:22.318
What about the infernal world?

09:22.318 --> 09:24.598
I relinquished my pen.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.000
Why? Because it frightened me.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.558
Threatened to make
the real world seem...

09:30.558 --> 09:33.679
pointless.
And colourless and drab.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.159
And that way lies madness.

09:38.238 --> 09:41.238
You know, the real world is what it
is, but we must live in it, so...

09:41.238 --> 09:45.159
You should write, if it makes you
happy. I worry about my eyes.

09:47.159 --> 09:50.519
And I think, as well...
when I got that reply from Southey -

09:50.519 --> 09:53.958
"Literature cannot be the business
of a woman's life."

09:57.279 --> 09:58.759
At the time I brushed it off.

09:58.759 --> 10:01.799
But the longer I've dwelt on it,
the older I've got,

10:01.799 --> 10:03.238
the more I've thought...

10:05.438 --> 10:06.718
..what's the point?

10:09.120 --> 10:11.120
The point...for me...

10:13.919 --> 10:16.078
..I'm never more alive
than when I write.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.519
You're the same, surely.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.639
But with no prospect of publication?

10:23.279 --> 10:25.039
It's just playing at it, isn't it?

10:28.598 --> 10:30.399
Are we playing then, or what?

10:32.078 --> 10:35.039
Does it ever bother you
that we might be getting...

10:35.039 --> 10:36.838
a bit old? For that.

10:40.358 --> 10:43.078
You weren't saying that
two weeks ago in York. No, well...

10:44.039 --> 10:46.438
I didn't want to spoil things
in York.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.679
It's something
I've been thinking for a while.

10:52.438 --> 10:55.438
Well, what did you come out
with me for then? To talk.

10:55.438 --> 10:59.438
What about? Things. At home.
Do you never think about...?

11:00.598 --> 11:01.639
What?

11:02.639 --> 11:04.558
The future!

11:04.558 --> 11:06.438
What are we
without Papa and Branwell?

11:06.438 --> 11:08.879
Papa won't... He won't live forever.

11:08.879 --> 11:11.078
And he's blind,
and that house, our house,

11:11.078 --> 11:13.478
it belongs to
the Church trustees, not us.

11:13.478 --> 11:15.759
And Branwell! What's he doing?

11:15.759 --> 11:18.718
What's he thinking
that he has such a hopeless grasp

11:18.718 --> 11:21.078
on the realities of what comes next?

11:21.078 --> 11:23.759
Are we nothing to him?
Does he even see us?

11:23.759 --> 11:26.238
If we don't make
something of ourselves,

11:26.238 --> 11:28.639
and God knows we've been trying,

11:28.639 --> 11:29.838
I've been trying...

11:29.838 --> 11:33.198
I was a governess at that
ludicrous place for five years!

11:34.679 --> 11:37.799
What will we do, Emily?
What will...

11:37.799 --> 11:39.318
What will we be?

11:43.799 --> 11:46.478
It was when I came back
from Roe Head.

11:46.478 --> 11:48.919
And he was there, at home,
Branwell.

11:50.639 --> 11:52.438
And he wasn't supposed to be.

11:53.958 --> 11:56.838
You'd gone. You and Charlotte.
You'd gone off back to Roe Head.

11:56.838 --> 11:58.879
And he was supposed to be in London,

11:58.879 --> 12:01.598
trying to get his foot in the door
at the Royal Academy.

12:03.198 --> 12:06.598
That's when I knew
what a liar he was.

12:06.598 --> 12:09.198
Sharpers? Thieves! So what?

12:09.198 --> 12:12.919
They attacked you? You were robbed?
Four of them?! I think four.

12:12.919 --> 12:15.318
In broad daylight? That's...

12:15.318 --> 12:17.598
Well, surely someone saw
what happened?

12:17.598 --> 12:20.438
You didn't even get there? No!

12:20.438 --> 12:22.759
It was just after I arrived
at the coaching inn

12:22.759 --> 12:25.120
at St Martin Le Grand,
and I knew my way around.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.478
From the maps in my head.

12:26.478 --> 12:30.519
But London...the whole thing is
so much bigger than I imagined.

12:30.519 --> 12:34.039
And you didn't tell me
how big it was, did ya?

12:34.039 --> 12:37.318
And I didn't know who to turn to,
with no money. So, I came home!

12:37.318 --> 12:39.879
Well, er... Witnesses.

12:39.879 --> 12:42.238
Surely someone must have seen
what happened.

12:42.238 --> 12:43.438
There were no witnesses.

12:43.438 --> 12:45.879
Everyone just turned around
and went about their business!

12:45.879 --> 12:47.478
So all 30 shillings?

12:48.478 --> 12:50.399
Gone? YES!

12:53.639 --> 12:54.759
Oh!

12:55.799 --> 12:59.198
Then, when Aunt Branwell went to bed
and Papa went back to his study,

12:59.198 --> 13:00.759
I said to him, "You're lying."

13:00.759 --> 13:02.000
And he admitted it.

13:03.039 --> 13:04.598
He didn't even make it to London,

13:04.598 --> 13:07.318
never mind any business
at any Royal Academy.

13:08.598 --> 13:11.078
He said he was about to get on
the high-flier, in Bradford,

13:11.078 --> 13:13.198
with his paintings and his sketches.

13:14.519 --> 13:18.279
But then, when he was faced with the
reality of setting off for London,

13:18.279 --> 13:21.399
he realised that they just...
weren't that good.

13:23.159 --> 13:25.238
They might look well enough at home,

13:25.238 --> 13:27.799
but next to a Lawrence,
or a Gainsborough...

13:27.799 --> 13:30.838
So he fortified himself, he said,

13:30.838 --> 13:33.879
to get courage to get on the next
coach, which was his intention.

13:36.919 --> 13:38.198
But he didn't.

13:40.478 --> 13:41.838
He spent four days in Bradford.

13:41.838 --> 13:43.919
Drunk and miserable
and dreaming up some trash

13:43.919 --> 13:46.759
that he thought everyone at home
would be blown enough to believe.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.438
He spent 30 shillings on drink,
in four days?

13:49.438 --> 13:52.639
I could've cheerfully murdered him,
to start with. And then...

13:55.120 --> 13:56.838
Actually I felt sorry for him.

13:59.279 --> 14:01.759
They always expected so much of him.

14:02.838 --> 14:06.120
More, probably,
than he was ever capable of.

14:07.958 --> 14:11.120
And I just thought,
"Thank God I'm not you."

14:15.120 --> 14:16.759
It's disappointing, I know.

14:19.198 --> 14:22.759
And I'm angry with him too.
He humiliated me at Thorp Green,

14:22.759 --> 14:24.399
and he knew what he was doing.

14:25.679 --> 14:27.558
But we shouldn't give up on him,
should we?

14:27.558 --> 14:32.438
No, we shouldn't give up on him. But
we should see him for what he is.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.639
Not what he isn't.
It's not fair on him.

14:40.039 --> 14:44.558
I sometimes think
Charlotte despises him. Mm, well...

14:45.799 --> 14:47.718
Charlotte has her own demons.

14:49.438 --> 14:50.598
What demons?

14:53.519 --> 14:57.078
Look, you know how low she's been?
For months.

14:57.078 --> 14:58.879
To the point of making herself ill,

14:58.879 --> 15:01.000
and convincing herself
she's going blind.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Yes? Well, you know
when we were in Brussels?

15:06.399 --> 15:08.879
Monsieur Heger? Yes.

15:08.879 --> 15:12.919
Well...she was very...

15:12.919 --> 15:15.078
taken...with him.

15:16.318 --> 15:18.598
Not when I was there.
This was after Aunt Branwell died,

15:18.598 --> 15:19.958
when I stayed at home.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.639
She became...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.159
..obsessed with him.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.238
He was married.

15:28.838 --> 15:31.000
That's why she left. At finish.

15:51.598 --> 15:53.358
"My dear Leyland,

15:53.358 --> 15:55.120
"I returned yesterday

15:55.120 --> 15:58.639
"from a week's journey
to Liverpool and North Wales,

15:58.639 --> 16:00.679
"but I found, during my absence,

16:00.679 --> 16:04.358
"that wherever I went,
a certain woman, robed in black

16:04.358 --> 16:07.799
"and calling herself Misery,
walked by my side,

16:07.799 --> 16:09.879
"and leant on my arm
as affectionately

16:09.879 --> 16:12.120
"as if she were my legal wife.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.879
"Like some other husbands,
I could have spared her presence."

16:28.120 --> 16:30.718
For the food
we are about to receive,

16:30.718 --> 16:33.679
may the Lord make us
truly thankful. Amen.

16:39.358 --> 16:41.799
Is she feeding those dogs again? No.

16:41.799 --> 16:43.759
Chicken, please.

16:45.478 --> 16:47.120
More tea.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.838
Branwell...

16:48.838 --> 16:53.838
Yeah? Tell us something
about...Liverpool.

16:53.838 --> 16:57.120
All right. Well,
the docks were extraordinary.

16:57.120 --> 17:02.599
Uh-huh? We saw a black man.
A blackamoor, a Creole.

17:02.599 --> 17:05.798
He really was black. So dark, Papa.

17:05.798 --> 17:07.559
Ah? And I spoke to him.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.079
Didn't really understand
what he was saying

17:10.079 --> 17:13.278
and I don't think he understood
a word I was saying either

17:13.278 --> 17:15.359
but it was just...fascinating.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.640
I think he was something
on one of the ships.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.599
MUFFLED LAUGHTER

17:36.759 --> 17:39.120
CHUCKLING

17:47.320 --> 17:48.798
Yes?

17:54.759 --> 17:56.999
If you...

18:01.519 --> 18:03.719
If you don't...

18:03.719 --> 18:05.920
get on top of...

18:05.920 --> 18:08.320
of this habit...

18:08.320 --> 18:10.278
when things don't go right for you,

18:10.278 --> 18:13.199
if you can't exercise
some restraint,

18:13.199 --> 18:16.120
then it'll take over your life,
Branwell. Don't be ridiculous.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.640
I'm not being ridiculous.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.560
It'll destroy you. Mm.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.798
Potentially, you still have
so much to offer, Branwell.

18:25.798 --> 18:28.999
You need a plan.
I've got plans. Have you?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.600
And can you share them? With anyone?

18:33.600 --> 18:36.840
D'you know what I've realised? What?

18:38.479 --> 18:40.400
There's no money in poetry.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.479
Novels.
That's where the money is.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.759
Whilst the composition of a poem

18:50.759 --> 18:54.439
demands the utmost stretch
of a man's intellect...

18:56.278 --> 18:59.320
..and for what?
達10 at best.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.038
I could hum a tune
and smoke a cigar

19:06.038 --> 19:07.759
and I'd have a novel written.

19:07.759 --> 19:10.278
No-one will publish a novel
by an unknown author.

19:10.278 --> 19:13.400
I've had nine poems published
in the Halifax Guardian.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.920
It's only Halifax, I know,
but it is widely enough read.

19:20.038 --> 19:22.080
You'd need a good story for a novel.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.640
Oh, when was I ever
short of a story?

20:32.080 --> 20:35.798
Are you still thinking about going
to Paris? I don't think it's likely.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.199
At the moment.
Why? It might do you good.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.840
Are you still hell-bent
on making yourself poorly?

20:45.840 --> 20:48.999
I'm not...poorly.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.360
I'm just struggling to...

21:00.719 --> 21:04.038
Why is it that a woman's lot
is so very different to a man's?

21:04.038 --> 21:08.759
I've never felt inferior.
Have you? Intellectually?

21:10.920 --> 21:13.719
Why is it that we have
so very few opportunities?

21:13.719 --> 21:17.439
You or I could do almost anything
we set our minds to. But no.

21:17.439 --> 21:20.239
All we can realistically plan
is a school, a modest enough school,

21:20.239 --> 21:21.640
that no-one wants to come to.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.719
Why is it that the woman's lot
is to be perpetually infantilised...

21:29.920 --> 21:33.400
..or else invisible and powerless
to do anything about it?

21:36.880 --> 21:38.798
Did he never write back
to you, then?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.880
Heger?

21:50.038 --> 21:51.519
No.

21:58.199 --> 22:00.880
Anne says
you've written some poems.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.120
Have you ever thought about
publishing them? No.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.120
It's just the...

22:23.160 --> 22:27.400
The thing is, you see...
I've written some verses too...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.920
and if between us we could
accumulate enough material

22:29.920 --> 22:31.999
to think about publishing
a small volume...

22:31.999 --> 22:34.360
And have it pored over
and rubbished and ridiculed

22:34.360 --> 22:38.080
by anyone who might choose to waste
their money on it? Not likely.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.239
"He comes with Western winds,
with evening's wandering airs,

24:43.239 --> 24:46.880
"With that clear dusk of heaven
that brings the thickest stars.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.479
"Winds take a pensive tone,
and stars a tender fire,

24:51.479 --> 24:55.080
"And visions rise, and change,
that kill me with desire."

24:58.479 --> 25:02.239
"High waving heather
'neath stormy blasts bending,

25:02.239 --> 25:05.320
"Midnight and moonlight
and bright shining stars;

25:05.320 --> 25:08.160
"Darkness and glory
rejoicingly blending,

25:08.160 --> 25:10.920
"Earth rising to heaven
and heaven descending,

25:10.920 --> 25:14.120
"Man's spirit away from
its drear dungeon sending,

25:14.120 --> 25:16.719
"Bursting the fetters
and breaking the bars."

25:18.400 --> 25:23.080
"Then dawns the Invisible;
the Unseen its truth reveals;

25:23.080 --> 25:26.880
"My outward sense is gone,
my inward essence feels;

25:26.880 --> 25:30.880
"Its wings are almost free -
its home, its harbour found,

25:30.880 --> 25:34.560
"Measuring the gulf, it stoops
and dares the final bound."

25:34.560 --> 25:38.719
"O dreadful is the check -
intense the agony -

25:38.719 --> 25:41.600
"When the ear begins to hear,
and the eye begins to see;

25:41.600 --> 25:44.759
"When the pulse begins to throb -
the brain to think again -

25:44.759 --> 25:47.439
"The soul to feel the flesh,
and the flesh to feel the chain.

25:47.439 --> 25:52.999
"Yet I would lose no sting,
would wish no torture less;

25:52.999 --> 25:56.920
"The more that anguish racks
the earlier it will bless;

25:56.920 --> 26:01.320
"And robed in fires of hell,
or bright with heavenly shine,

26:01.320 --> 26:05.519
"If it but herald Death,
the vision is divine."

26:39.600 --> 26:41.719
BANGING

26:41.719 --> 26:44.560
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

26:50.120 --> 26:52.199
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

26:52.199 --> 26:53.880
Somebody has been in my room!

26:53.880 --> 26:56.080
Somebody?
Somebody has been through my things.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.920
And not had the wit,
when they put them back,

26:57.920 --> 27:00.519
to realise that everything was
in a certain order Well, who?

27:00.519 --> 27:02.239
We haven't, I haven't.
You haven't.

27:02.239 --> 27:03.880
You wouldn't. I know that.

27:03.880 --> 27:04.959
Branwell's in Halifax.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.759
It's safe to assume
Papa couldn't see to do it,

27:06.759 --> 27:08.320
and anyway why would he bother?

27:08.320 --> 27:11.278
Tabby's got better things to do
and Martha can't read that well.

27:11.278 --> 27:13.160
Yet, she also has too much dignity

27:13.160 --> 27:15.400
and respect
for other people's things!

27:15.400 --> 27:18.080
I shouldn't have...I know.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.798
But I'm not sorry.
I mean, I am sorry!

27:22.798 --> 27:24.479
Look, Emily.

27:24.479 --> 27:27.038
Your poems are...

27:27.038 --> 27:28.798
They're extraordinary.

27:28.798 --> 27:31.199
I know they're private,
I know they're personal -

27:31.199 --> 27:33.840
they're 1,001 things, but they're
not something to keep hidden.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.360
I admit it was curiosity,
but not idle curiosity, I hope,

27:39.360 --> 27:41.439
but something more...noble. Noble?!

27:41.439 --> 27:44.519
Going in people's bedrooms?
Going through people's things?

27:44.519 --> 27:47.798
No woman, no-one, has ever
written poetry like this!

27:47.798 --> 27:50.479
Nothing I've read,
nothing I can think of,

27:50.479 --> 27:52.999
nothing published, is its equal.

27:52.999 --> 27:55.479
Emily...they're exceptional.

27:55.479 --> 27:56.959
They're...astonishing.

27:56.959 --> 27:59.160
I couldn't breathe
when I was reading them.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.719
I know you're angry and
I know what I did is unforgivable.

28:04.719 --> 28:06.439
Except, please, see that it isn't.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.439
You...disgust me.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.719
You can't begin to imagine how much.

28:14.719 --> 28:17.600
You stay out of my room
and you don't speak to me.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.759
You don't speak to me generally and
you don't speak to me specifically

28:20.759 --> 28:24.519
about your misguided, tedious,
grubby little publishing plans.

28:26.199 --> 28:28.199
What on earth is the matter?

28:28.199 --> 28:31.600
She has been in people's bedrooms
going through people's things!

28:31.600 --> 28:33.400
I'm putting a lock on that door!

28:33.400 --> 28:35.840
She? What happened?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.320
Charlotte? Nothing.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.999
It was nothing.
I went in her bedroom.

28:41.999 --> 28:45.759
Oh!
HE SIGHS

28:47.920 --> 28:50.439
And, um, where is Branwell?

28:50.439 --> 28:53.360
Halifax. He's where? Halifax.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.120
Oh. And is he due in? Tonight?

28:57.439 --> 29:01.560
Or have we to lock the back door?
I imagine he's taken a key.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.959
Right.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.320
All right! I made a mistake.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.680
Except I didn't!

29:30.840 --> 29:32.120
They're...

29:33.360 --> 29:34.798
Have you read them?

29:34.798 --> 29:36.080
No.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.080
She's never asked me to.

29:43.239 --> 29:46.560
What did she mean about your
"grubby little publishing plans?"

30:11.278 --> 30:12.798
They're not without charm.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.160
It's not just the poems, you see.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.360
I'm writing this, too.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.798
It's a novel.

30:24.798 --> 30:27.320
It's not Gondal and Gaaldine.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.239
It's more about how things are
in the real world.

30:31.278 --> 30:33.600
It's about being a governess,
it's all...

30:33.600 --> 30:36.199
things I've seen and heard
and witnessed.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.920
The thing is, you see, I...
This is beautifully written.

30:44.519 --> 30:46.519
I would be ready.

30:46.519 --> 30:49.400
To try and publish.
I would be ready to risk failure.

30:49.400 --> 30:52.640
And who knows? This is what
we've done all our lives.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.199
Write. We've lived in our heads.

30:56.719 --> 30:59.278
I don't regard the attempt
to do something with it as venal.

30:59.278 --> 31:01.600
It's more venal selling ourselves
as governesses

31:01.600 --> 31:03.439
when we find it such a trial.

31:03.439 --> 31:06.880
So long as we approached
it carefully, wisely,

31:06.880 --> 31:10.600
and not make fools of ourselves,
then surely... The plan...

31:10.600 --> 31:14.400
would be to try to publish
a volume of poetry first.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.560
And, then, if that met with
a modicum of success,

31:18.560 --> 31:20.759
and something of a name
was established,

31:20.759 --> 31:23.080
then we could each risk
a work of fiction.

31:25.239 --> 31:28.400
I've toyed with writing
something about...Brussels.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.439
I mean, I don't even know
if that's the etiquette.

31:33.439 --> 31:36.719
But I could write to
a publishing house and find out.

31:39.759 --> 31:43.038
Your poems are competent...

31:43.038 --> 31:44.519
and charming.

31:44.519 --> 31:46.479
And I'm no great poet myself,

31:46.479 --> 31:50.560
but Emily's contribution could
elevate a small volume

31:50.560 --> 31:51.999
into something...

31:53.600 --> 31:56.080
..actually worth spending
a few shillings on.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.680
I feel sorry for her. Why?

32:06.120 --> 32:08.920
Same reason I feel sorry
for Branwell.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.759
So much is expected of her.
Being the eldest.

32:11.759 --> 32:14.439
And not even the eldest.
By accident the eldest.

32:14.439 --> 32:17.439
Bossiest. She was bossy when Maria
and Elizabeth were still alive,

32:17.439 --> 32:19.278
I remember it. Vividly.

32:20.759 --> 32:23.400
It's being so bossy
that's stunted her growth.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.920
She's ambitious.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.759
For all of us.

32:26.759 --> 32:28.880
And I can see
nothing wrong with that.

32:30.999 --> 32:34.400
I realise some people might think
it's vulgar, but, Emily,

32:34.400 --> 32:38.880
we were born writing, and if we're
cautious, if we're clever,

32:38.880 --> 32:41.880
and we are, and if we disguise
our real selves and our sex...

32:41.880 --> 32:43.719
Right, that's done.

32:43.719 --> 32:46.120
Tabby! I'm off down the...hill.

32:48.278 --> 32:52.120
It's wonderful how quiet they all
think she is in t'village

32:52.120 --> 32:53.920
and how loud she is at home.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.160
You can come with me, if you want.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.719
Have you ever thought about writing
something that's not Gondal?

33:04.719 --> 33:07.959
Something more...not princesses
and emperors, more just...

33:07.959 --> 33:09.759
what happens in the real world.

33:11.320 --> 33:15.160
You know when I worked in Halifax?
At that school at Law Hill.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.400
Yes. Miss Patchett, that ran it,
she told me this tale.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.160
And I've often thought
it'd make a story. A novel.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.320
What was it about?

33:22.320 --> 33:25.439
This man, this lad. Jack Sharp.
Have I never told you this?

33:25.439 --> 33:28.640
It serves us well enough, but it's
not an attractive building, I know.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.560
It has a rather curious history.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.719
It was built out of spite,
apparently, 60 years ago,

33:33.719 --> 33:35.439
by a man called Jack Sharp.

33:35.439 --> 33:37.400
So, there's this family,
the Walkers.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.038
They own Walterclough Hall,
this big house, just above Halifax,

33:40.038 --> 33:41.759
it's been in the family
for generations.

33:41.759 --> 33:43.999
They're woollen manufacturers -
aren't they all?

33:43.999 --> 33:47.120
Anyway, John Walker has four
children - two boys and two girls -

33:47.120 --> 33:49.239
and he's adopted this nephew,
Jack Sharp.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.560
Richard and John, the two sons,
were educated well,

33:54.560 --> 33:56.880
and they ended up
making their livings in London.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.278
Jack stayed at home with the girls,
Grace and Mary,

33:59.278 --> 34:01.840
and he was trained up
to take over the family business

34:01.840 --> 34:04.919
which suited everyone, because,
it seems, he'd always been

34:04.919 --> 34:07.318
old Mr Walker's favourite,
the truth be told.

34:07.318 --> 34:09.399
Then when Richard,
the eldest son, dies

34:09.399 --> 34:11.000
in some tragic accident somewhere,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.960
old Mr Walker decides to leave
the district and he leaves Jack

34:13.960 --> 34:16.358
in charge of his business
and Walterclough Hall.

34:16.358 --> 34:19.797
Eventually, some years later,
old Mr Walker himself dies,

34:19.797 --> 34:21.559
and the remaining son, John,

34:21.559 --> 34:24.398
in London, inherits everything
and gives Jack Sharp,

34:24.398 --> 34:28.119
who he'd never liked, notice
to vacate the property forthwith.

34:28.119 --> 34:30.480
But John Walker Jr
has the law on his side,

34:30.480 --> 34:33.239
and after enough wrangling,
in court, Jack Sharp has to

34:33.239 --> 34:35.679
vacate the property,
whether he likes it or not.

34:35.679 --> 34:39.239
But not before he'd trashed the
place and taken anything of value.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.277
Furniture...

34:40.277 --> 34:42.239
..the silver, the plate, the linen.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.960
You can only imagine
what they all went through.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.000
The anger and the bitterness.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.878
And then he built his own home,
a new house.

34:49.878 --> 34:51.277
Here, at Law Hill.

34:51.277 --> 34:53.719
The spot chosen very carefully,
people believed,

34:53.719 --> 34:56.039
because it looks down
on Walterclough Hall.

34:56.039 --> 34:58.960
And then he filled it with the stash
he'd purloined from the Hall.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.838
Like he was goading John Walker
to come and fetch it. If he dared.

35:01.838 --> 35:06.000
And did he dare? I doubt it.
But the worst thing Jack Sharp did,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.798
one of old Mr Walker's sisters
had a son,

35:07.798 --> 35:09.398
grown up by then, called Sam Stead.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.440
And Jack Sharp apprenticed him
in the trade,

35:11.440 --> 35:14.358
like he himself had been apprenticed
by old Mr Walker.

35:14.358 --> 35:17.480
And he cleverly,
calculatedly, bit by bit,

35:17.480 --> 35:20.559
indulged and degraded Sam Stead
with gambling and drink,

35:20.559 --> 35:22.918
and the lad was too feckless
to know any better.

35:22.918 --> 35:24.119
Why would you do that?

35:24.119 --> 35:26.358
He did it to cause as much misery
and humiliation

35:26.358 --> 35:27.639
to the Walkers as he could.

35:27.639 --> 35:32.440
That's... I know. All that anger.
It's so...rich.

35:34.838 --> 35:38.679
Anyway, if we're writing novels.
I imagine we'll need more paper.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.519
BELLS PEAL

35:45.519 --> 35:47.519
Of course we're not going to
use our real names!

35:47.519 --> 35:49.000
But must they be men's names?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.960
When a man writes something, it's
what he's written that's judged.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.398
When a woman writes something,
it's her that's judged.

35:54.398 --> 35:57.759
We must select the poems
we want to use and then...

35:57.759 --> 36:01.519
yes, if we're to be taken seriously
and judged fairly

36:01.519 --> 36:03.798
and make anything resembling
a profit...

36:05.239 --> 36:06.639
..we must walk invisible.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.278
What about names that are
neither men's nor women's?

37:02.639 --> 37:05.838
"Dear Ellen. I reached home
a little after 2 o'clock

37:05.838 --> 37:07.719
"all safe and right yesterday.

37:07.719 --> 37:10.358
"Emily and Anne were gone
to Keighley to meet me.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.878
"Unfortunately,
I had returned by the old road

37:12.878 --> 37:16.239
"while they were gone by the new,
and we missed each other."

37:30.318 --> 37:31.759
KNOCK ON DOOR

37:31.759 --> 37:33.079
I'm back home.

37:33.079 --> 37:34.440
Ah, Charlotte...

37:36.119 --> 37:37.358
Miss Bronte!

37:38.599 --> 37:40.119
Mr Nicholls.

37:51.679 --> 37:54.960
"I went into the room where
Branwell was, to speak to him.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.239
"It was very forced work
to address him.

37:57.239 --> 38:00.159
"I might have spared myself
the trouble as he took no notice..."

38:00.159 --> 38:01.440
Branwell?

38:01.440 --> 38:02.798
"..and made no reply."

38:02.798 --> 38:04.318
Branwell.

38:04.318 --> 38:06.519
"He was stupefied."

38:13.599 --> 38:15.239
What's this?

38:15.239 --> 38:17.159
Branwell? What's this?

38:17.159 --> 38:18.480
That's for you.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.599
I opened it by mistake.
It said "Esquire."

38:22.599 --> 38:24.039
Give me that.

38:24.039 --> 38:26.159
Proof pages!

38:26.159 --> 38:29.798
How much are you paying them for
the privilege of being published?

38:29.798 --> 38:32.039
I assume you're paying them.

38:32.039 --> 38:35.159
I assume you've all
clubbed together.

38:35.159 --> 38:37.559
I assume they're not paying you.

38:37.559 --> 38:39.398
You've been sick.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.039
I didn't confirm or deny,
I made no reply.

38:48.039 --> 38:50.198
I don't care about him knowing
we're paying them,

38:50.198 --> 38:52.119
it's a means to an end
as far as I'm concerned.

38:52.119 --> 38:53.519
I care about him talking to people.

38:53.519 --> 38:56.278
About us. Where's he got the money
from anyway? To get into that state?

38:56.278 --> 38:58.918
He screwed a sovereign out of Papa,
yesterday. He claimed to have

38:58.918 --> 39:01.519
some pressing matter, and Papa said
no. And the next thing you know

39:01.519 --> 39:03.918
he's given it to him. God knows how
or why and he's trotting off

39:03.918 --> 39:05.878
down the hill to get it changed
at the Black Bull.

39:05.878 --> 39:08.318
Perhaps, when he's sober,
he'll not even remember he's seen

39:08.318 --> 39:10.838
our proof sheets. I'll write to
Aylott and Jones and ask them

39:10.838 --> 39:13.198
to address our correspondence
differently in future.

39:14.318 --> 39:17.039
Was he angry, Branwell?
What can we do?

39:17.039 --> 39:19.559
We can't include him, the way
he is now! He's unmanageable!

39:19.559 --> 39:21.519
We'd never get anything
agreed or done!

39:21.519 --> 39:24.639
Anyway, why would Northangerland
want to publish with his sisters?

39:24.639 --> 39:27.000
He certainly couldn't afford
to contribute to the costs.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.440
We're doing the right thing, Anne.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.798
It's hard, it's tough,

39:30.798 --> 39:33.639
but I'm sorry, he'd drag us down
with him if we let him.

39:36.119 --> 39:37.679
Right, come on, you big oaf.

39:38.719 --> 39:40.559
That way. Shift.

40:19.679 --> 40:23.039
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

40:23.039 --> 40:25.798
HAMMERING

40:36.559 --> 40:38.039
Hello, Joe.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.519
Well, I never.

40:41.519 --> 40:42.559
Eh?

40:59.398 --> 41:04.878
How y'doing, lad? I've resolved
this morning to keep myself busy.

41:04.878 --> 41:06.119
Good.

41:08.119 --> 41:09.639
Good!

41:09.639 --> 41:10.918
Me too.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.559
I thought I'd go and see
John Frobisher.

41:16.559 --> 41:18.798
I thought I might write
something to set to music.

41:18.798 --> 41:22.119
And he'd be the man.
He is still here, isn't he?

41:22.119 --> 41:24.159
At the church?
So far as I know, yeah.

41:24.159 --> 41:26.519
Have y'not thought any more
about going abroad?

41:26.519 --> 41:29.159
Not... No...

41:30.480 --> 41:32.278
I haven't seen any vacancies,

41:32.278 --> 41:35.440
at least nothing, you know...

41:36.798 --> 41:39.440
Not with the way things are
at the moment.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.159
How are things at home?

41:47.639 --> 41:49.079
It's like living with people

41:49.079 --> 41:51.039
who don't speak
the same language as I do.

41:52.398 --> 41:54.719
Honestly, Joe.
I could be with some tribe

41:54.719 --> 41:56.878
from some far flung corner
of the globe

41:56.878 --> 41:58.679
for all I have in common with them.

41:58.679 --> 42:00.559
They despise me,

42:00.559 --> 42:01.719
and I...

42:03.639 --> 42:06.278
I only live there because
I'm such a fucking pauper.

42:08.039 --> 42:10.239
They need to get married,
those three.

42:11.398 --> 42:12.960
Only, who'd have 'em?

42:15.358 --> 42:17.278
Who'd have any of us?

42:18.318 --> 42:20.480
What a ridiculous set we've become.

42:23.599 --> 42:26.318
And we used to be
quite a nice little family.

42:38.159 --> 42:41.838
She...she does love me, you know,
Joe, Lydia.

42:44.358 --> 42:47.679
Yeah. Well...
You know, I don't know.

42:50.159 --> 42:51.759
I wasn't there, I can't say.

42:53.878 --> 42:55.798
I know everyone thinks I'm...

42:56.878 --> 42:59.639
God knows, but if you saw her,

42:59.639 --> 43:03.198
if only for a moment,
you'd get it, you'd see.

43:03.198 --> 43:05.079
What would I see?

43:05.079 --> 43:08.759
That she's the kind of woman
that can change a man's life.

43:08.759 --> 43:10.559
His whole...everything.

43:10.559 --> 43:13.198
You've got to look forward,
though, eh? Not back.

43:14.358 --> 43:15.918
We've talked about this.

43:20.239 --> 43:22.198
Am I boring you, Leyland?

43:22.198 --> 43:24.198
No, lad. No. You're not boring me.

43:28.918 --> 43:30.960
I worry that you're kidding yerself.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.358
Eh?

43:32.358 --> 43:35.198
A woman her age, in her position.

43:40.918 --> 43:44.239
My only hope is that he'll be dead
soon and I'll be asked back.

43:58.639 --> 44:00.239
Hello.

44:06.239 --> 44:07.878
Hello.

44:13.838 --> 44:15.398
Look.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.679
I know.

44:34.358 --> 44:36.440
Ahh, it's beautiful!

44:36.440 --> 44:39.559
The same moon that's shone down
since we were children.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Since our ancestors were children.

44:44.278 --> 44:45.719
We're so tiny, really.

44:47.519 --> 44:49.159
Aren't we? So...

44:50.198 --> 44:51.519
..so unimportant.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.440
All of us.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.119
That's right.

44:59.679 --> 45:02.039
DOGS BARK IN THE DISTANCE

45:05.318 --> 45:06.798
Bloody dogs.

45:08.759 --> 45:10.918
HE HOWLS

45:12.559 --> 45:14.278
SHE JOINS HIM

45:14.278 --> 45:18.398
A CACOPHONY OF HOWLING

45:19.798 --> 45:21.878
HE LAUGHS

45:21.878 --> 45:24.079
THEY CONTINUE HOWLING

46:02.119 --> 46:05.039
There's a fella in Black Bull
lookin' for thee. Who?

46:05.039 --> 46:07.639
He says he's from Thorp Green.

46:10.079 --> 46:11.519
Who?

46:14.159 --> 46:15.480
I'll get my coat.

46:26.358 --> 46:28.198
Shift!

46:37.440 --> 46:40.480
Is there a fella looking for me?
Aye, he's through there.

46:43.358 --> 46:44.838
Mr Bronte.

46:46.759 --> 46:49.838
Someone's dead. Mr Robinson.

46:51.480 --> 46:54.599
He passed away three weeks
this last Tuesday.

46:55.639 --> 46:56.759
Did you not know?

46:57.798 --> 47:00.119
No. How could I?

47:01.239 --> 47:02.719
Well, it's been in t'papers.

47:03.798 --> 47:05.519
We don't get the York papers.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.918
You're advised...

47:29.318 --> 47:30.918
..to stay away.

47:38.318 --> 47:42.079
Does she not...want me
to go to her?

47:44.878 --> 47:46.239
She didn't say that.

47:46.239 --> 47:47.679
No, it isn't her.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.918
It's Mr Evans.

47:50.918 --> 47:53.559
One of the trustees
of Mr Robinson's will.

47:55.318 --> 47:58.960
Apparently...he's said
if he sees you, he'll shoot you.

48:01.159 --> 48:02.398
Did he send you?

48:02.398 --> 48:04.119
No. No.

48:04.119 --> 48:05.719
She did.

48:07.039 --> 48:09.759
She was concerned you might turn up.

48:09.759 --> 48:13.278
And that Mr Evans might feel
obliged to do as he's threatened.

48:15.719 --> 48:18.878
But, as well as that,
you should know

48:18.878 --> 48:20.519
by the terms of the will...

48:22.119 --> 48:24.599
..that if she marries again,

48:24.599 --> 48:27.878
she'll forfeit any right
to her husband's fortune.

48:29.239 --> 48:30.759
What?

48:30.759 --> 48:32.079
Every penny.

48:33.639 --> 48:35.480
And the house.

48:39.639 --> 48:41.119
She...

48:50.719 --> 48:53.119
She asked me not to tell you
how wretched she is.

48:54.719 --> 48:56.719
You'd not recognise her, Mr Bronte.

48:58.198 --> 49:01.519
She's worn herself out these past
few months in attendance upon him.

49:01.519 --> 49:04.000
And then, the last few days
before his death,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.639
his manner was so mild, so, er...

49:08.759 --> 49:10.198
..conciliatory.

49:12.679 --> 49:15.358
It's a pity to see her,
kneeling at her prayers.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.719
In tears.

49:18.719 --> 49:20.878
I suppose we can only guess at

49:20.878 --> 49:23.918
what torments of conscience
she might be going through...

49:26.480 --> 49:27.759
..now.

49:32.239 --> 49:35.198
But...she sent you.

49:35.198 --> 49:36.519
Hm.

49:38.960 --> 49:43.000
To beg you to think of
your own safety, Mr Bronte.

49:44.719 --> 49:45.878
And her sanity.

49:47.159 --> 49:48.639
Which...

49:48.639 --> 49:50.798
below stairs,

49:50.798 --> 49:53.878
we fear hangs by a thread.

49:56.198 --> 49:58.719
I don't give a damn
about my own safety.

50:00.759 --> 50:01.838
No.

50:03.239 --> 50:05.119
But the thing is...

50:09.239 --> 50:11.918
..it's never going to happen,
Mr Bronte.

50:14.398 --> 50:16.159
Do you understand?

50:22.878 --> 50:24.679
You're advised to stay away.

50:50.878 --> 50:53.639
Mr Brown! Mr Brown!

50:54.679 --> 50:57.000
Mr Brown! What do you want,
you little bugger?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.878
You've to come! Mr Thomas at
Black Bull says you've to come!

51:07.039 --> 51:08.679
Now what? God knows.

51:08.679 --> 51:10.639
There were a fella here.

51:10.639 --> 51:13.278
Paddy? Come on, lad. What's up?
I sent for thee.

51:13.278 --> 51:16.000
Look at state he's in...
No, you've done right.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.198
Come on, lad.

51:17.198 --> 51:19.159
BRANWELL WEEPS

51:19.159 --> 51:21.398
Come on, you're all right.

51:22.599 --> 51:24.198
Nothing I do, John.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.198
You're just tired. Nothing I do.

51:28.198 --> 51:30.759
Let's get you home. Come on.

51:34.519 --> 51:37.440
Why are we going up here?
It's where you live.

51:37.440 --> 51:41.039
I don't want to go home,
I don't want to go home.

51:41.039 --> 51:43.559
Well, where d'you want to go, then?

51:43.559 --> 51:44.960
Keighley.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.759
I think meself
you'd be better off at home.

51:47.759 --> 51:50.440
No, no! I need to go to
Thorp Green, John.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.918
I need to go to Thorp Green.

51:51.918 --> 51:55.559
Fair enough, but not just now,
not today, not in this state.

51:55.559 --> 51:58.838
Yes, in this state.
This is the right state.

51:58.838 --> 52:01.878
Well, you can. I can't, obviously,

52:01.878 --> 52:05.198
it's two o'clock in the afternoon,
I've to get to work.

52:06.639 --> 52:08.159
Ah, Mr Nicholls.

52:08.159 --> 52:11.719
He's... He's had a bad do,

52:11.719 --> 52:13.679
he's had a bit of bad news.

52:17.639 --> 52:19.159
Down you go.

52:22.039 --> 52:23.559
Nearly there.

52:30.838 --> 52:32.440
Careful. Nearly there.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.599
BRANWELL SOBS

52:34.599 --> 52:37.719
Calm down. Get off me!
Please, keep your voice down.

52:37.719 --> 52:39.960
Shut up, I hate you!

52:39.960 --> 52:42.599
Tell me to calm down
in my own house!

52:42.599 --> 52:43.918
I want to kill you!

52:43.918 --> 52:47.559
Get your hands off me! Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.

52:47.559 --> 52:49.878
I don't want you
to tell me anything.

52:50.798 --> 52:52.159
My house!

52:52.159 --> 52:53.759
Nothing wrong with me.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.440
Look at them, all looking at me!

53:01.679 --> 53:03.480
They're always looking at me!

53:03.480 --> 53:06.119
With your stupid, empty faces!

53:08.079 --> 53:10.759
Please, stop looking at me!

53:10.759 --> 53:11.918
Just stop.

53:16.759 --> 53:18.278
And him!

53:22.198 --> 53:23.878
What do you want, eh?

53:25.239 --> 53:27.119
You've had everything!

53:27.119 --> 53:29.599
You've had everything
you're getting.

53:29.599 --> 53:33.440
You just stand there
staring at me all the time!

53:35.398 --> 53:37.159
I hate you!

53:38.798 --> 53:42.278
BRANWELL WEEPS
AND MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

53:48.398 --> 53:50.239
Come on upstairs, have a lie down.

53:52.358 --> 53:54.039
Have a few knock-out drops, eh?

53:55.159 --> 53:57.559
Eh? Come on.

53:57.559 --> 53:59.599
Ohh...I feel sick.

53:59.599 --> 54:01.398
Come on.

54:01.398 --> 54:04.878
Up we go. You heard him. Lift me up.

54:04.878 --> 54:06.838
I can do it!

54:20.599 --> 54:22.278
Sorry. Sorry.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.878
"Dear Ellen.

54:35.878 --> 54:38.798
"We have been somewhat
more harassed than usual lately.

54:38.798 --> 54:41.960
"The death of Mr Robinson has served
Branwell for a pretext

54:41.960 --> 54:44.798
"to throw all about him
into hubbub and confusion.

54:44.798 --> 54:47.159
"He's become intolerable.

"To Papa he allows rest

BRANWELL AND FATHER ARGUE IN ROOM

55:05.398 --> 55:08.239
Morning, Miss Bronte. Thank you.

55:08.239 --> 55:10.278
BRANWELL: Are you stupid
as well as blind?

55:10.278 --> 55:11.878
There's nothing out there!

55:11.878 --> 55:14.519
Not for someone
who's fit for nothing, like me!

55:14.519 --> 55:18.599
"He says Mrs Robinson is now insane,
that her mind is a complete wreck,

55:18.599 --> 55:21.679
"owing to remorse for her conduct
towards Mr Robinson,

55:21.679 --> 55:24.278
"whose end it appears was hastened
by distress of mind,

55:24.278 --> 55:26.278
"and grief for having lost him.

55:27.960 --> 55:30.719
"I do not know how much to believe
of what he says.

55:30.719 --> 55:34.079
"He now declares that he neither can
nor will do anything for himself.

55:35.719 --> 55:38.119
"Good situations have been offered
more than once,

55:38.119 --> 55:41.198
"for which by a fortnight's work
he might have qualified himself,

55:41.198 --> 55:44.278
"but he will do nothing except
drink and make us all wretched."

55:44.278 --> 55:46.079
BRANWELL: Just tell me where it is!

55:48.039 --> 55:51.719
BRANWELL AND FATHER CONTINUE ARGUING

55:51.719 --> 55:54.798
I beg you to recognise it -
you are ill!

56:01.719 --> 56:05.398
Two reviews. One from The Critic
one from The Athenaeum.

56:05.398 --> 56:09.358
Both anonymous,
but both really, really quite good.

56:09.358 --> 56:10.838
Especially about you.

56:12.639 --> 56:15.559
"Refreshing, vigorous poetry,
no sickly affectations,

56:15.559 --> 56:19.159
"no namby-pamby, no tedious
imitations of familiar strains."

56:23.239 --> 56:24.960
Are they still fighting?

56:29.838 --> 56:32.198
Are you going to be all right?

56:32.198 --> 56:34.679
When I go to Manchester with Papa?

56:34.679 --> 56:38.239
It's only three weeks. I'm more
concerned about when he comes back.

56:38.239 --> 56:39.759
He'll need rest and quiet.
Not...

56:39.759 --> 56:42.198
Oh, did you get what you wanted?

56:42.198 --> 56:44.599
Yeah, you!
Are you proud of yourself, eh?

56:44.599 --> 56:47.599
Wangling money out of a blind man?
A man practically in his 70s.

56:47.599 --> 56:51.918
Fuck off. Eh! Come back here and say
that. Yeah, go on. Have a go.

56:51.918 --> 56:53.639
See what happens. I haven't time.

56:53.639 --> 56:56.159
No? Just the blind and the elderly
then, is it?

56:56.159 --> 56:57.838
Otherwise I would.

56:57.838 --> 56:59.759
Course you would!

57:29.358 --> 57:30.918
It's nothing.

57:30.918 --> 57:32.198
Did he just hit you?

57:34.679 --> 57:36.039
Don't make a fuss.

57:48.278 --> 57:51.278
I'm still aiming to finish my story
by the end of this week.

57:52.440 --> 57:55.119
There's a handful of passages
I'd like to look at again,

57:55.119 --> 57:58.039
but then, depending on where
you and Anne are with yours...

57:58.039 --> 58:01.559
Oh, The Professor's finished.
As much as it ever will be.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.000
Perhaps we could aim to get them off
to a publisher

58:06.000 --> 58:07.878
before you set off for Manchester.

58:30.559 --> 58:31.960
Emily.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.440
Good luck.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.159
And you.

58:35.159 --> 58:36.878
Keep him wrapped up, see.

58:36.878 --> 58:39.440
All the bags on?
Everything's under control, Papa.

58:39.440 --> 58:42.519
Has she heard? Yes! I've heard.
Emily, Emily.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.599
You know where the gun is?

58:44.599 --> 58:45.918
Yes.

58:47.159 --> 58:48.719
We're all in. Thank you.

58:49.838 --> 58:52.719
I'll send you the address
as soon as we know what it is.

58:54.079 --> 58:55.480
DRIVER: Walk on!

59:04.960 --> 59:08.440
Branwell doesn't know
where the gun is. Does he?

59:08.440 --> 59:10.079
Not any more.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.599
Is he still abed?

59:12.798 --> 59:14.398
Daft question.

59:24.239 --> 59:25.480
You give him no money.

59:25.480 --> 59:27.719
Whatever sob stories
he comes up with.

59:28.838 --> 59:29.960
All right?

59:32.358 --> 59:34.079
He won't hit you.

59:34.079 --> 59:36.759
And if he hits me,
I'll hit him back. Harder.

59:47.960 --> 59:51.358
"Dear Ellen. Papa and I came here
on Wednesday.

59:51.358 --> 59:54.239
"We saw Mr Wilson, the oculist,
the same day.

"He pronounced Papa's eyes
quite ready for an operation

stay here a month at least.

"It will be dreary.

"...not able at present
to consider publication."

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:08.440
Do you think
they actually read them?

01:01:09.918 --> 01:01:12.079
Do they look like they've been read?

01:01:27.838 --> 01:01:29.278
Who's next on the list?

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:40.960

"..of taking a walk that day."

01:03:16.798 --> 01:03:21.159
Do you think it's wrong to write
about something very close to home?

01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:22.440
Like what?

01:03:24.398 --> 01:03:25.440
A woman...

01:03:27.639 --> 01:03:31.318
..forced to abandon her home.
A good, well-off home,

01:03:31.318 --> 01:03:33.519
to protect her child and herself,

01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:37.639
because of a change in her husband's
character when he sinks into...

01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:42.318
You know, addictive behaviour.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.798
And then forced to make her own way
in the world.

01:03:45.798 --> 01:03:48.398
No. I don't think it's wrong.

01:03:50.198 --> 01:03:51.918
I'd never have invented Hindley

01:03:51.918 --> 01:03:54.559

such a fine example at home.

01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:07.119
Have you seen Branwell today?
No.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:10.519
Have you heard him?

Come on, son, sit up.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.599
Let's get him in the house. Come on.

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:49.798
DOOR OPENS

01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:52.440
You know where I am. Yes, yes.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.119
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

01:07:56.318 --> 01:07:58.278
DOOR CLOSES

01:08:00.798 --> 01:08:02.278
There is hope.

01:08:03.759 --> 01:08:05.480
He's home, he's back with us.

01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:09.918
And, with nourishment
and abstinence,

01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:13.158
and prayer, and peace and quiet,

01:08:13.158 --> 01:08:15.838
we may yet hope for better things.

01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:21.279
His body has suffered the ravages
of gross neglect. And...

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.837
abuse.

01:08:24.078 --> 01:08:25.479
Self inflicted.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:30.479
And I cannot, in all conscience,

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.479
do other than blame that woman.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.520
That...sinful, hateful woman.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.759
Who, with her more mature years
and social advantages,

01:08:40.759 --> 01:08:43.759
surely should have shown
better responsibility.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.118
He has come very low.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:53.118
But, you know, sometimes
a man must sink to the bottom

01:08:53.118 --> 01:08:55.479
before he can turn his life around.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:09:01.078
And perhaps that's what's happened,
what's happening.

01:09:01.078 --> 01:09:02.719
Here. Where's he been?

01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:05.158
How's he been living?

01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:06.600
Does he want to abstain?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.038
Oh, he has to. He has to abstain.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.118
Halifax, I assume.

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:15.560
I don't know. That's where
John always imagined he was.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.078
Or where John knew
damned well he was.

01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:20.798
Have you talked to him?
About abstention?

01:09:21.959 --> 01:09:23.399
He's asleep.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:26.038
It'll only work if he's determined
to do it himself.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.759
Anne. Ssh!

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:42.600
I...

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.759
Anne.

01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:48.837
I should have done more.
At Thorp Green.

01:09:48.837 --> 01:09:51.759
I should have stopped him,
I should've told someone,

01:09:51.759 --> 01:09:53.118
I should've...

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.719
I'm...complicit in their sin.

01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:00.719
No, you're not.

01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:03.320
You were in an impossible position.
I let it happen.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.719
All I did was leave, in the end...

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.959
I was a coward.

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:14.480
A moral coward, before God.

01:10:22.079 --> 01:10:23.918
WOMAN LAUGHS

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.039
CHORUS OF LAUGHTER

01:10:52.119 --> 01:10:54.240
LAUGHTER BECOMES MORE RIOTOUS

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.039
Are you all right, lad?

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:37.200
Lydia.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.959
Wake up! Wake up! There's a fire.

01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:55.320
HE SHIVERS

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.520
I think I've put it out.

01:11:57.798 --> 01:12:00.480
Branwell! Branwell! Branwell!

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.959
Look at me.

01:12:01.959 --> 01:12:03.320
Branwell!

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.159
Delirium tremens.

01:12:05.159 --> 01:12:06.520
It's when someone

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.640
who's been drinking solidly
for weeks suddenly stops.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.560
Either through choice
or, more usually, lack of funds.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.640
The body doesn't know how
to respond, so it goes into spasm.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.719
Will it happen again?

01:12:25.959 --> 01:12:28.440
With care...no.

01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:32.640
But you do need
to keep an eye on him.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.878
He's lucky.
You could've been sending

01:12:34.878 --> 01:12:37.600
for the undertaker this morning,
Mr Bronte, not me.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.759
I think
rather than come back in here,

01:12:56.759 --> 01:13:00.759
he should stay
in my bedroom with me.

01:13:02.999 --> 01:13:04.560
For the time being.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.719
I wrote a rhyme for you.

01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:27.440
Did you?

01:13:28.918 --> 01:13:31.878
Well, I wrote it, and I was thinking
about you, after I'd written it.

01:13:31.878 --> 01:13:32.959
So...

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.918
It goes...

01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:38.959
D'you want to hear it?

01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:40.360
Yes.

01:13:42.759 --> 01:13:44.400
It starts, it's...

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.119
The first line is...

01:13:48.959 --> 01:13:50.719
It goes...

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:52.640
"No coward soul is mine

01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:57.360
"No trembler in the world's
storm-troubled sphere

01:13:58.759 --> 01:14:00.878
"I see Heaven's glories shine

01:14:00.878 --> 01:14:03.520
"And Faith shines equal
arming me from Fear..."

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.680
Take your time.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.480
"Oh, God, within my breast...

01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:14.640
"Oh, God, within my breast

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.360
"Almighty ever-present Deity

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.918
"Life

01:14:20.918 --> 01:14:24.280
"As I Undying Life,

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:29.759
"Vain are the thousand creeds

01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:33.600
"Unutterably vain,

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.640
"Worthless as withered weeds

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.560
"Or idlest froth

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.838
"To waken doubt in one...

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.320
"To waken doubt in one

"With wide-embracing love

"Thy spirit animates eternal years

"Pervades and broods above

"Changes, sustains, dissolves,

"Though earth and moon were gone

"And what thou art

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.640
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:48.560
Not for someone like you.

01:15:57.798 --> 01:15:59.240
I love you.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.440
Good.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.320
I love you.

01:16:15.959 --> 01:16:18.360
Who? Currer. Bell.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.560
There's no-one of that name here.
No, I know that, Mr Bronte,

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.440
only it's addressed to here, so...
That's a mystery.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.240
There's no-one of that name
in the entire parish,

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.878
as far as I'm aware.

01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:32.200
No, well, that's why I thought
happen a visitor.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.079
No, no. No visitors.

01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:36.719
Not at the moment.

01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:39.918
Fair enough, I'll take it back
to sorting office then.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:00.240
Ah, morning, Miss Bronte.
Did I hear the name?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360
Currer Bell? Yes.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:07.680
Good. That's not me. Obviously.
But if I could take it,

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.600
I can make sure it reaches him.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.878
Him.

01:17:13.159 --> 01:17:15.959
You see, he... Papa, he forgets.

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:20.838
He's... Mr Bell, he's not here.

01:17:20.838 --> 01:17:24.480
He was here. But now...he isn't.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.280
So, I can forward it to him.
I have his address.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.680
It's a funny name.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.999
Currer. I thought happen it were
summat to do wi' Mr Nicholls.

01:17:33.999 --> 01:17:37.079
Arthur Bell Nicholls. No.
No, no, no, that's... It's just...

01:17:37.079 --> 01:17:39.719
That's just coincidental.
Can I take it?

01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:42.918
Good! Well, that saves me filling in
a docket back at sorting office.

01:17:42.918 --> 01:17:45.560
I'm much obliged. And so will he be.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.798
How's your...brother? Is he...?

01:17:47.798 --> 01:17:49.079
Oh, he...

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.320
He's...you know.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.600
Till tomorrow, then! Miss Bronte.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.159
Bye! Bye. Bye.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.560
Where's Emily?

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.400
Kitchen. D'you want her?

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.759
Letter from a publisher.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.680
Emily!

01:18:53.039 --> 01:18:55.159
Thomas Cautley Newby

01:18:55.159 --> 01:18:58.200
is offering to publish
Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.680
His terms are steep,
but he's offering to publish them,

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.759
which is more than anyone else
has done, so...

01:19:02.759 --> 01:19:04.119
What about The Professor?

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.280
No.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.440
No, he's not offering
to publish that. Why?

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.959
So you need to think about how you
want to approach this. No, that's...

01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:14.560
We should publish them
all together or not at all. Surely.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.560
That's sentimental, it's kind,

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.440
but it's nonsense.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.918
This is a solid offer,
not a generous one, as I say,

01:19:21.918 --> 01:19:25.079
but I'll persevere in sending out
The Professor

01:19:25.079 --> 01:19:27.719
and with the other one
that I've been writing.

01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:30.798
But in the meantime, you've got
a choice to make. Read it.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.600
He's asking for you to provide
an advance of 達50

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.200
towards the cost of publication.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.320
But clearly he believes it's viable
or he wouldn't make the offer.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.838
This is addressed to Currer Bell.
Yes. That was interesting.

01:19:43.838 --> 01:19:47.520
You didn't...
Of course not! I had to...

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.640
..fib.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.079
達50.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:55.759
Perhaps that's normal. Perhaps
whoever undertook to publish it

01:19:55.759 --> 01:19:57.918
would ask for an advance
of that sort.

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:01.680
We're a risk, we're unknown, despite
the poems. Because of the poems.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.240
Two copies sold.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.878
You will...persist?

01:20:06.878 --> 01:20:08.759
Oh, yes.

01:20:28.999 --> 01:20:30.959
BANGING ON DOOR

01:20:38.119 --> 01:20:39.480
Yes?

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.719
I'd like to speak to Mr Bronte.

01:20:41.719 --> 01:20:43.119
The Reverend Bronte?

01:20:43.119 --> 01:20:45.039
Mr Patrick Bronte.

01:20:45.039 --> 01:20:47.159
What shall I say it's to do with?

01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:48.759
Is he in?

01:20:48.759 --> 01:20:50.400
Who wants to know?

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.119
I'm a bailiff of the county
appointed by Mr Rawson,

01:20:53.119 --> 01:20:54.798
the magistrate at Halifax.

01:20:54.798 --> 01:20:57.640
I'm here about an unpaid debt.
Is Mr Bronte in?

01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.999
I'll...

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.039
You'll just have to
give me a minute.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.280
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.320
Yes?

01:21:16.999 --> 01:21:19.838
The's a man at the door, Mr Bronte.

01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:23.240
He says he's here about
an unpaid debt.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.959
He says he's been sent
by a magistrate at Halifax.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.600
Now, then, gentlemen. How may I help
you? Mr Patrick Bronte? Yes.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.838
I'm appointed by the Magistrate
at Halifax to collect a debt of

01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:55.480
達14, 10s 6d,

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.480
owing to Mr Crowther of the
Commercial in Northgate, Halifax,

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.759
and now outstanding
for a total of eight months.

01:22:00.759 --> 01:22:04.360
What's going on?
Branwell, what's going on?

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.759
Branwell...

01:22:05.759 --> 01:22:07.959
Shift. Shift...

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.320
Not so fast, little fella.
Steady now!

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.999
You don't want me to hurt you.

01:22:18.999 --> 01:22:22.680
And you don't want to hurt me,
cos, if you do,

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.280
there'll be bother. Get off me!

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.999
I think it must be
my son that you want.

01:22:27.999 --> 01:22:31.480
Your son? Right, well,
where is your son, Mr Bronte?

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.440
I've got him, Mr Riley!

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.400
Emily! Get him off me! I can't
breathe, Emily! Stop wriggling!

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.240
Stop struggling! You're not going
anywhere! I've done nothing wrong!

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.719
You've got the wrong man!
What were you legging it for then?

01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:46.600
And why did you try and hit me,
you little twat.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.320
Get your hands off me!
Are you Patrick Bronte? Up!

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.240
Are you Patrick Branwell Bronte?

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.878
Answer the man!

01:22:55.878 --> 01:22:57.959
I have no idea who these people are.

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:02.798
You owe money
to some publican in Halifax.

01:23:02.798 --> 01:23:04.838
And if the debt isn't paid,

01:23:04.838 --> 01:23:07.400
they'll take you
to the debtors' prison.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.280
You'd best pay up then, eh?

01:23:13.079 --> 01:23:14.240
Take him.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.719
What?

01:23:15.719 --> 01:23:19.240
No! Papa, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.400
I didn't mean it! I'm sorry!
Charlotte! Emily!

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.039
We have money. We have money!
We have money, please stop them.

01:23:26.039 --> 01:23:27.440
Please. Hang on, boys!

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.079
Bring him back. If it's all right
with you, Reverend,

01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:43.480
my colleagues'll keep hold of him
until I've got the remittance.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.440
I shall require a receipt.

01:23:46.719 --> 01:23:48.320
I shall give you one.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.680
Come on.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.039
It's all right.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.119
"Gentlemen. I have received
your communication

01:24:44.119 --> 01:24:46.640
"of the 5th instant,
for which I thank you.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.600
"Your objection to the want of
varied interest in The Professor is,

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.838
"I am aware, not without grounds.

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:54.480
"I have a second narrative
in three volumes now completed,

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.119
"to which I have endeavoured
to impart a more vivid interest

01:24:57.119 --> 01:24:58.719
"than belongs to The Professor.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:02.440
"I send you per rail a manuscript,
entitled Jane Eyre,

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.280
"a novel in three volumes
by Currer Bell."

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.959
VOICES IN ANOTHER ROOM

01:26:23.959 --> 01:26:26.719
BRANWELL: One of us is not going to
leave that room alive!

01:26:26.719 --> 01:26:29.600
I will either kill you
or I will kill myself!

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.759
Do you want me to kill myself? Eh?

01:26:31.759 --> 01:26:34.440
Cos if I do, old man,
you can rest assured

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.480
that you'll have driven me to it

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.440
with your endless prayers
and your drivel!

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.159
Can you not understand,
can you not get the idea

01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:49.320
that the only...only respite I have
from the misery of my existence

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.918
is being allowed
a little bit of something to drink.

01:26:52.918 --> 01:26:55.320
I'm only asking for a shilling,
for God's sake!

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.079
Just...just take it.

01:27:17.039 --> 01:27:20.959
He'll just go on and on until
he gets what he wants anyway.

01:27:21.999 --> 01:27:23.240
And I just...

01:27:25.079 --> 01:27:27.640
..I don't always have the energy...

01:27:28.999 --> 01:27:30.039
..any more.

01:27:58.999 --> 01:28:02.280
I know this is contradicting
what I've said before, but...

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.878
..my second thoughts are,
occasionally,

01:28:05.878 --> 01:28:07.400
better than my first ones.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.119
I think you should tell Papa
about Jane Eyre.

01:28:12.878 --> 01:28:14.759
About how successful it's been.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.759
Why?

01:28:18.759 --> 01:28:21.280
I think it would help him to know

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.520
that we now seem to have found
a means of supporting ourselves,

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.680
possibly, in the event of...
whenever something happens to him.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.838
Why Jane Eyre?

01:28:31.838 --> 01:28:35.640
No, we'll tell him about everything,
but just...as a way in.

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:40.119
But then...he'll read it.

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.719
Now?

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.200
SHE KNOCKS

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.400
Hello?

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.039
Papa?

01:29:55.039 --> 01:29:57.159
Have you got a moment?

01:29:57.159 --> 01:29:58.719
Yeah, quickly.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.798
I've...

01:30:05.159 --> 01:30:07.440
I've...I've been writing a book.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.520
A book. And... Oh, well...

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.039
Would you like to read it?

01:30:13.039 --> 01:30:15.039
No, I can't.

01:30:15.039 --> 01:30:16.560
I don't have time.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.520
And you know, with your tiny,
little writing, I can't see it.

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.640
But well done.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.520
The thing is, you see...
it's published.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.200
It's been published,

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.918
it's a properly published...
it's a book in three volumes.

01:30:38.838 --> 01:30:40.560
Well, well!

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.119
Currer Bell.

01:30:46.119 --> 01:30:48.759
No, he's famous, he's...
No, that's me.

01:30:49.838 --> 01:30:52.480
That's you? What's you?!

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.719
That...

01:30:53.719 --> 01:30:56.360
I've published under a pseudonym.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.320
Currer Bell.
You see, it's the same initials.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.480
And the thing is, it's just about
to go into a second edition.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.119
It's...sold a lot of copies.

01:31:05.119 --> 01:31:07.878
It's been really
quite unusually successful.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.838
There's a stage play of it
in rehearsal as we speak

01:31:12.838 --> 01:31:15.838
at a theatre in...
the Victoria Theatre, in fact,

01:31:15.838 --> 01:31:17.200
in London.

01:31:18.759 --> 01:31:20.719
It's been so, um...

01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:23.039
hugely well received.

01:31:24.798 --> 01:31:25.999
But I...

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.320
So...you're...?

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.079
You're...?! Yes.

01:31:34.079 --> 01:31:36.680
And...I've made money.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.039
With the prospect of making
quite a lot more.

01:31:39.039 --> 01:31:43.320
And if we...if I continue
to work hard

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.079
and produce the kind of writing

01:31:45.079 --> 01:31:47.119
that people are prepared
to pay money for,

01:31:47.119 --> 01:31:50.759
then it should furnish us
with a comfortable existence.

01:31:54.918 --> 01:31:57.119
Would you like me to read you
some of the reviews?

01:31:57.119 --> 01:31:59.039
Well, I...

01:31:59.039 --> 01:32:01.159
HE LAUGHS

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:06.200
Why have you kept it such a secret?
To protect ourselves.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.959
We've been accused of
vulgarity and coarseness.

01:32:09.959 --> 01:32:13.079
I have "forfeited my right to be
called a member of the fairer sex"

01:32:13.079 --> 01:32:14.719
according to Lady Eastlake,

01:32:14.719 --> 01:32:17.480
who speculates that Currer Bell
might actually be a woman

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.480
and complicit in the revolutions
throughout Europe.

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.360
"We do not hesitate to say
that the tone of mind and thought

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.159
"which has overthrown authority
and violated every code -

01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:30.079
"human and divine - abroad,

01:32:30.079 --> 01:32:32.759
"and fostered Chartism
and rebellion at home,

01:32:32.759 --> 01:32:35.280
"is the same which has also written
Jane Eyre."

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.400
Jane Eyre.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.520
And why is it vulgar?
It isn't, Papa!

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.798
People are just squeamish about
the truth, about real life.

01:32:43.798 --> 01:32:46.798
Our work is clever.
It's truthful.

01:32:46.798 --> 01:32:50.838
It's new, it's fresh, it's vivid
and subtle and forthright.

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:56.240
But...more importantly,
the point is...

01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:59.719
..we didn't want Branwell to know.

01:33:00.798 --> 01:33:03.878
That's first and foremost
why we've kept it a secret.

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:06.079
It's not that he'd be scathing,
we can stand that.

01:33:06.079 --> 01:33:08.320
It's because it's what
he always wanted to do.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.079
And now it looks less and less
likely that he ever will,

01:33:11.079 --> 01:33:13.360
it'd be like rubbing salt
into a wound.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.640
No-one can ever know who we are.
We've agreed.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.039
We just didn't want you
to worry that we weren't

01:33:19.039 --> 01:33:22.200
doing anything with ourselves,
because we have been. We are!

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.999
So, who else knows, besides me?

01:33:25.999 --> 01:33:28.039
No-one. I've not even told Ellen.

01:33:28.039 --> 01:33:29.520
Tabby?

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.400
No-one. The publishers
don't even know who we are.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.959
They think we're three men.

01:33:33.959 --> 01:33:37.600
We'd like to keep it that way.
We just wanted you to know.

01:33:39.959 --> 01:33:41.600
HE SIGHS

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.918
Little Helen Burns.

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.999
That's your little sister, Maria.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.159
Maria was our big sister.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.240
Yeah. Of course she was.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.918
Of course she was.

01:34:03.719 --> 01:34:07.280
Not a day passes
when I don't think about her.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.878
And little Elizabeth.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.798
And your mother.

01:34:28.959 --> 01:34:31.400
I am very proud of you.

01:34:39.798 --> 01:34:41.878
I always have been.

BELLS CONTINUE RINGING

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.798
(Have you got a minute?)

01:37:05.959 --> 01:37:08.878
What?
We're going to have to go to London.

01:37:08.878 --> 01:37:12.320
Who is? We are. All three of us.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.680
When? Today.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.240
Why?

01:37:19.798 --> 01:37:21.878
Your...

01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:26.560
Mr Newby must've... I don't know...

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.200
sold the first few pages of
The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.520
to an American publisher
on the understanding

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.200
that it was written Currer Bell.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.600
Well, it's obviously
a misunderstanding.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.400
No. Will you...

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.159
please...see

01:37:39.159 --> 01:37:42.759
that this man is a con man.
A rogue!

01:37:42.759 --> 01:37:45.600
How many mistakes did
he print in Wuthering Heights?

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.360
Proofs that you painstakingly
corrected that he ignored,

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.119
and now this.
My publisher is livid

01:37:51.119 --> 01:37:54.360
that I could have sold my next novel
to another publisher.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360
They have first refusal
of my next two novels,

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.280
and now they think I'm some kind of
unscrupulous double-dealer!

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.838
Well, just write and explain. No.

01:38:01.838 --> 01:38:05.039
No, we have to go to London

01:38:05.039 --> 01:38:07.798
and give ocular proof
that we are three separate people,

01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:10.039
the novels are not all the work
of one person,

01:38:10.039 --> 01:38:12.400
and that this is absolute trash.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.039
Well, I'm not going.

01:38:14.039 --> 01:38:18.640
Why? Because you can write a letter
and explain all that,

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.320
and just say that Newby's made
a mistake. This is not a mistake!

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.878
This is a deliberate
and deceitful attempt

01:38:24.878 --> 01:38:27.119
to cash in on the success
of Jane Eyre. Sorry.

01:38:27.119 --> 01:38:29.079
It isn't! It is!

01:38:29.079 --> 01:38:32.320
Newby has made the mistake,
along with a lot of other people,

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.200
of assuming we're all one person,
that is all it is.

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.759
Why are you so obtuse?

01:38:37.759 --> 01:38:39.878
Why are you so melodramatic?

01:38:39.878 --> 01:38:41.119
Emily!

01:38:41.119 --> 01:38:44.079
I don't want The Tenant
Of Wildfell Hall promoted and sold

01:38:44.079 --> 01:38:46.878
on a deceitful...
misunderstanding, whichever,

01:38:46.878 --> 01:38:48.878
that it's by anyone other than me.

01:38:48.878 --> 01:38:50.838
We have to go to London.

01:38:50.838 --> 01:38:52.119
Now.

01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:53.759
Today.

01:38:53.759 --> 01:38:56.440
And explain to Mr Smith and Mr
Smith Williams what's happened.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.640
It's intolerable to imagine they
could think I could be so slippery.

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.079
But, wait, look, you can't.

01:39:01.079 --> 01:39:03.440
You can't go to London
and explain who you are

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.680
because they will see you.
That's the whole point.

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.119
Yes, and you promised -
you promised me -

01:39:08.119 --> 01:39:11.039
that we would never reveal ourselves
to anyone. Ever.

01:39:11.039 --> 01:39:12.560
Well...

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.719
I'm afraid because of
your...Mr Newby...

01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:21.280
..we now find ourselves in a...
situation.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.838
Emily...I think we should go.

01:39:23.838 --> 01:39:25.719
No! You're not going, either.

01:39:25.719 --> 01:39:27.520
No, I am! No, you're not.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.280
Newby's compromised my integrity
just as much as Charlotte's.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.360
I shan't publish with him again.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.159
If you won't come with us,
that's...that's your choice.

01:39:36.159 --> 01:39:38.918
We don't need to fall out
about this, Emily.

01:39:38.918 --> 01:39:41.280
It's about your novel -
and your name.

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.240
It's got NOTHING to do with me!

01:39:44.759 --> 01:39:46.360
Don't be like that, Em...

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.480
What's the matter?

01:40:08.918 --> 01:40:10.440
Emily.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.878
Yes, but you do know her bark's
worse than her bite, don't you?

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.918
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.878
Charlotte...

01:41:43.878 --> 01:41:45.400
Jane Eyre.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.959
Look.

01:42:04.039 --> 01:42:05.878
Can I help you, ladies?

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.959
Yes.

01:42:10.759 --> 01:42:12.480
Yes, I'd...

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.039
We'd like to speak to
Mr George Smith, please.

01:42:21.039 --> 01:42:22.520
Mr Smith?

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.200
Mr Smith's very busy.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.480
Yes...

01:42:28.079 --> 01:42:30.838
But the thing is, you see...
It's important.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.200
Can I tell him what it's about?

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.759
Just...

01:42:37.039 --> 01:42:39.320
Just that it's a matter
of importance.

01:42:40.798 --> 01:42:43.400
I'll, er... I'll see what...

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.240
I'll see if he's got a minute.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.560
Who should I say is asking
to see him? It's...

01:42:50.759 --> 01:42:52.039
That's delicate.

01:42:52.039 --> 01:42:53.680
He is a very busy man.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.440
We've been travelling
for 17 hours,

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.480
and we'll take up less than
one minute of his time.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.560
Sir, two ladies asking to see you.
What ladies?

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.480
Didn't give a name, sir.
What's it about?

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.159
The only thing I could prise out,
sir, is that it's important.

01:43:17.159 --> 01:43:21.039
To me or to them? They've asked for
no more than a minute of your time.

01:43:21.039 --> 01:43:24.280
They say they've travelled
for 17 hours.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.680
Ladies. How can I help you?

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.320
Am I addressing Mr George Smith?
Yes.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.200
It's a confidential matter.

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.400
We're...

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.200
We're here to address
a misunderstanding,

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.039
which, once accomplished,
will be to everyone's advantage,

01:44:01.039 --> 01:44:02.640
yours as much as ours.

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.680
And so we apologise
for what must be an interruption

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.119
to your morning's work.

01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:10.400
But perhaps if I gave you this,
it would clarify who we are.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.320
Where did you get this letter?

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.680
In the post. From you.

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.959
You sent it to me.

01:44:23.159 --> 01:44:26.159
I am...Currer Bell.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:29.159
C Bronte, that's me.

01:44:29.159 --> 01:44:31.039
And this is Acton Bell,

01:44:31.039 --> 01:44:32.480
author of Agnes Grey.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.119
The point is, author of
The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall, not me.

01:44:36.119 --> 01:44:40.280
And Ellis couldn't come.
Ellis didn't want to come.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.240
Ellis is... Anyway...the point is...

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.280
we are three sisters.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.039
I have not sold the first few pages
of my next novel

01:44:50.039 --> 01:44:53.320
to an America publisher, as claimed
by Mr Thomas Cautley Newby.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.878
That is not my novel, it's Acton's.

01:44:55.878 --> 01:44:59.999
I...Mr Smith, have nothing, exactly
nothing, to do with Mr Newby.

01:44:59.999 --> 01:45:02.959
And nor will my sister, now she has
seen him in his true colours.

01:45:02.959 --> 01:45:05.360
We are people of integrity.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.079
And probity.

01:45:07.079 --> 01:45:10.240
And that is why we are here.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.600
To set matters straight.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.719
Sorry, you're...

01:45:14.918 --> 01:45:17.079
You are Currer Bell?

01:45:17.079 --> 01:45:19.759
What makes you doubt it, Mr Smith?

01:45:19.759 --> 01:45:22.360
My accent? My gender? My size?

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.680
Oh, good heavens!

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:31.360
Oh, good Lord!

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.719
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

01:45:34.719 --> 01:45:38.719
I'm sorry, too,
we've caught you off-guard.

01:45:38.719 --> 01:45:41.798
But you see, we felt it best
to come and see you in person,

01:45:41.798 --> 01:45:44.079
given the tone of your letter.

01:45:44.079 --> 01:45:47.159
I wanted no room left for any
further misunderstanding or doubt.

01:45:47.159 --> 01:45:49.640
That's deeply, deeply appreciated,
Miss...

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.918
BOTH: Bronte.

01:45:50.918 --> 01:45:53.079
And a great relief, of course.

01:45:53.079 --> 01:45:55.878
Have you really been travelling
for 17 hours?

01:45:55.878 --> 01:45:58.999
Through the night. Such was
the tone of your letter that..

01:45:58.999 --> 01:46:00.440
You must be exhausted.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.440
Oddly, Mr Smith,
I feel extraordinarily awake.

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.759
Where are you staying?

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:08.680
We've booked into the Chapter
Coffee House. In Paternoster Row.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.999
Our father stayed there briefly
before he went up to Cambridge.

01:46:11.999 --> 01:46:17.560
And my sister and I,
my other sister, Ellis, did once,

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.838
before we travelled to Brussels.
You've taken my breath away.

01:46:21.838 --> 01:46:25.520
Miss Bronte.
Oh, you have to meet people.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.918
Have you any idea how many people
want to... Thackeray!

01:46:28.918 --> 01:46:32.440
Thackeray, Thackeray...
Thackeray will have to meet you.

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:33.680
Er...Kent, Kent.

01:46:34.759 --> 01:46:38.600
Kent! Fetch Smith Williams!
You have to meet Smith Williams.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.280
He...he is such an admirer
of...of...of...

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.600
He was...

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.280
..of your genius.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:51.240
He was the one that read...that read
The Professor, and saw instantly,

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.240
before Jane Eyre -
which is glorious, by the way -

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.400
um, he saw...

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.600
he saw, he saw, Miss Bronte.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.640
The whole of literary London -
the whole of London -

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.039
will fall over itself
to spend a minute

01:47:09.039 --> 01:47:10.959
in the company of Currer Bell.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:13.918
Um, somebody really needs

01:47:13.918 --> 01:47:16.759
to do something about this Mr Newby,
though, Mr Smith.

01:47:16.759 --> 01:47:19.039
Absolutely, indeed.
He will be dealt with.

01:47:19.039 --> 01:47:21.918
Please, please, come through
to my office.

01:47:21.918 --> 01:47:23.680
Ah, Smith Williams!

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.999
This...

01:47:24.999 --> 01:47:26.680
This is...

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.200
Currer Bell.

01:47:31.039 --> 01:47:32.878
Oh, how perfect.

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.079
How delightful.

01:47:39.079 --> 01:47:41.320
And this is Acton...Bell.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.878
Ellis couldn't come.
Do you like opera?

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.600
BRANWELL COUGHS

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.079
I'll see to him,
I'll sit with him.

01:48:10.838 --> 01:48:11.959
Are you sure?

01:48:11.959 --> 01:48:13.838
You go sleep in their bed.

01:48:13.838 --> 01:48:15.039
Branwell.

01:48:16.119 --> 01:48:17.600
I'm going to be sick.

01:48:18.878 --> 01:48:21.320
HE VOMITS

01:48:44.119 --> 01:48:46.400
You're back!

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.560
That was quick!
All the way to London.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.640
How were things here? Oh, well,

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.918
we've had sad work with Branwell.
But other than that...

01:48:56.918 --> 01:48:59.280
Good. Good.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.600
You're the last person in the world
I want to fall out with.

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.719
I know.

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:25.200
We only told Mr Smith
and Mr Smith Williams.

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.159
Well, and Newby, later.

01:49:27.159 --> 01:49:30.878
No-one else. We made it clear they
hadn't to tell anyone else either.

01:49:30.878 --> 01:49:33.200
They took us
to the Royal Opera House,

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.838
Mr Smith and Mr Smith Williams did,

01:49:34.838 --> 01:49:36.759
with Mr Smith's mother
and his sisters,

01:49:36.759 --> 01:49:38.918
and us with nothing to wear
but what we'd gone in.

01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:40.520
They'd no idea who we were!

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:43.240
Heaven alone knows what
they must have thought about us.

01:49:45.159 --> 01:49:46.600
He's...

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.039
What?

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.520
Branwell.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.878
He's been vomiting blood.

01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:11.520
"Dear Ellen,

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.200
"I received your letter informing us

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.918
"of the time of your arrival
in Keighley with great delight.

01:50:15.918 --> 01:50:18.719
"Emily and Anne anticipate
your long-delayed visit

01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:20.560
"as eagerly as I do, myself.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.878
"We will be outside the Devonshire
Arms promptly at two o'clock.

01:50:23.878 --> 01:50:26.200
"Wishing you a safe
and comfortable journey."

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.838
Anyone for Keighley?

01:50:32.079 --> 01:50:33.640
Ellen!

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.159
Charlotte!

01:50:36.838 --> 01:50:38.280
Emily!

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.240
Anne! Miss Nussey.

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:42.119
Which one's your box?
Is it this one?

01:50:42.119 --> 01:50:44.119
Yes, that one there.
How was your journey?

01:50:44.119 --> 01:50:45.200
Long, tiresome.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.918
We haven't seen you for so long.

01:50:46.918 --> 01:50:48.600
I know, I've missed you.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.240
Shall we go? Yes.

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:03.200
In the end I realised
we'd delay your visit forever

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.400
if we weren't careful.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.959
And he's so quiet now.

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:09.640
We barely see him during the day.
He just sleeps.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.878
I think more people have crosses
to bear than we realise.

01:51:12.878 --> 01:51:15.079
On the domestic side.

01:51:15.079 --> 01:51:16.640
On the quiet.

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.680
The oddest thing -
I think I told you -

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.360
The Robinson girls, you know the
youngest two, Elizabeth and Mary?

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.600
They've started writing to Anne.

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.878
About six months after
their father died.

01:51:29.878 --> 01:51:33.400
I mean, they're very fond of Anne,
more than she imagined.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.878
Then they wanted to visit. Here.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:40.200
So we let them,
and they came last week.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.878
Of course, Branwell knew
nothing about it.

01:51:42.878 --> 01:51:45.680
What were they like? Oh.

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.360
You know.

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.918
Pretty. Vacuous.

01:51:49.918 --> 01:51:51.959
Non-stop yak-yak-yak.

01:51:51.959 --> 01:51:53.878
Emily popped her head in,

01:51:53.878 --> 01:51:56.480
purely to satisfy her own curiosity,
of course,

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:59.200
and then, after approximately
four seconds, withdrew.

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.360
It's one of the few occasions
I've really enjoyed her surliness.

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:07.200
Anyway, the point is,
they told us last week...

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.640
..that their mother...

01:52:12.039 --> 01:52:13.759
What?

01:52:17.159 --> 01:52:18.918
..is going to marry...

01:52:18.918 --> 01:52:20.798
Sir Edward Scott.

01:52:20.798 --> 01:52:24.240
So much for contrition
and guilt and madness

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.400
and clauses in people's wills.

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.759
He's been very sadly used, Branwell.

01:52:30.119 --> 01:52:31.400
You didn't tell him?

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.999
What purpose would it serve?

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.999
I'm sorry to inflict
all this on you, Ellen.

01:52:37.999 --> 01:52:41.400
Charlotte, I'm your oldest friend.

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.918
You can tell me anything,
you know that.

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:46.480
Look!

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:52.680
What is that? It's extraordinary.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.079
It's three suns!

01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.680
What is it? It's beautiful.

01:53:01.079 --> 01:53:02.560
It's you three.

01:53:30.159 --> 01:53:32.400
You can go now.

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:53.719
You'll have to sit him up
to get his shirt off.

01:55:50.838 --> 01:55:54.999
'Tis a shame you're embarked on this
course of myopic self-destruction!

01:55:54.999 --> 01:55:57.079
'I despise everything you stand for!

01:55:57.079 --> 01:55:59.280
'Revolution is in the air!

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.440
'Only a fool like you, sir,
would ignore it!'

01:56:42.798 --> 01:56:45.280
..this is the famous
dining room table,

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:47.719
at which the sisters used to sit
and write.

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:40.798
Have you been inspired by the story
of the Bronte sisters?
