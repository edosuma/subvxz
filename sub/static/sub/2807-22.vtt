00:04.951 --> 00:06.828
What are you looking at?

00:06.995 --> 00:11.082
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.710
Wow! It looks really violent!

00:13.918 --> 00:16.254
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

00:16.421 --> 00:19.174
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

00:20.884 --> 00:24.762
- I cannot wait to see this.
- It's generating Oscar buzz.

00:24.971 --> 00:28.308
- I started that!
- I thought I did!

00:28.516 --> 00:30.602
I just talked to my agent...

00:30.852 --> 00:33.188
...and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

00:34.981 --> 00:36.983
- Will we take a limo?
- Sure!

00:37.442 --> 00:39.652
I love taking limos when nobody died.

00:41.362 --> 00:43.531
Well, I won't be able to come.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.494
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

00:48.703 --> 00:53.583
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

00:53.750 --> 00:58.046
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

00:58.213 --> 01:00.548
I'm looking forward
to the next part...

01:00.965 --> 01:03.468
...but I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.684
That's right. Still no baby.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.437
Come on, people, make some room.

01:14.604 --> 01:19.025
Uh, sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

01:20.193 --> 01:21.778
You.

01:24.531 --> 01:27.408
Like you haven't done enough.

01:28.576 --> 01:32.914
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

01:33.081 --> 01:35.208
I wish I were a sea horse.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.049
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

01:45.802 --> 01:49.556
And then also, um,
I'd be far away in the sea.

02:02.151 --> 02:03.778
God.

02:04.404 --> 02:09.658
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

02:09.908 --> 02:12.287
I know. I remember toward the end...

02:12.453 --> 02:16.416
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

02:18.334 --> 02:20.128
Oh...

02:20.295 --> 02:24.465
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

02:26.467 --> 02:28.636
Let's.

03:10.553 --> 03:13.473
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

03:15.850 --> 03:18.478
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

03:20.021 --> 03:23.650
- What are you doing here?
- They sent me home from work.

03:23.858 --> 03:27.362
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

03:27.528 --> 03:29.530
You know what? Screw them!

03:29.697 --> 03:32.533
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

03:34.535 --> 03:36.913
Or you could do volunteer work.

03:39.457 --> 03:42.168
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

03:42.377 --> 03:47.465
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

03:47.674 --> 03:52.470
- You told me I could have six tickets.
- I sold four on eBay.

03:54.597 --> 03:57.392
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

03:59.060 --> 04:02.355
So that's it?
I only get to bring one guest?

04:02.563 --> 04:05.733
Yeah. What time do you
want to pick me up?

04:07.110 --> 04:08.778
Hello?

04:09.612 --> 04:13.074
You hear that?
I only get one extra ticket.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.910
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

04:19.247 --> 04:22.792
- What about me?
- You said you didn't want to go.

04:23.084 --> 04:25.920
I would still like
to be acknowledged.

04:26.212 --> 04:29.841
- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
- Definitely not invisible.

04:33.261 --> 04:37.014
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

04:37.265 --> 04:41.060
- You snooze, you lose.
- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

04:41.269 --> 04:42.895
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

04:43.730 --> 04:49.068
And, Joey, not that this should, uh, affect
you at all, but, um, if you pick me...

04:49.277 --> 04:53.448
...I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress out down to here.

04:56.033 --> 04:58.703
- I haven't seen this dress.
- Star in a movie.

05:00.580 --> 05:05.460
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

05:05.626 --> 05:07.670
Phoebe.Phoebe.Phoebe.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.924
Well, uh...

05:14.552 --> 05:16.095
I think I want to take Chandler.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.015
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

05:22.602 --> 05:26.606
- You want to take me?
- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

05:26.814 --> 05:29.817
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

05:29.984 --> 05:33.488
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

05:33.654 --> 05:35.531
This will be my way
of paying you back.

05:36.616 --> 05:39.160
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

05:42.205 --> 05:46.501
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

05:46.667 --> 05:51.839
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

05:52.673 --> 05:57.303
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

05:57.512 --> 06:01.599
He read lines with me.
He went with me on auditions.

06:01.849 --> 06:05.102
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts.

06:05.311 --> 06:08.856
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

06:09.106 --> 06:12.235
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

06:13.402 --> 06:17.240
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

06:19.742 --> 06:22.370
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

06:24.247 --> 06:29.418
- I'm gonna go shave. Ahem.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go, uh, spit.

06:33.381 --> 06:35.925
Ugh, I have to pee.

06:36.092 --> 06:41.430
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

06:43.057 --> 06:46.602
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just...

06:47.979 --> 06:49.272
...Out of her.

06:50.898 --> 06:54.110
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

06:54.277 --> 06:57.822
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

06:57.989 --> 07:00.199
Hmm. Care to make it interesting?

07:01.701 --> 07:05.121
- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
- You're on.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.916
- Okay, how much?
- One hundred thousand dollars.

07:10.251 --> 07:13.713
- How about 50 bucks?
- I'll call Zurich and move some money.

07:15.423 --> 07:17.842
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

07:19.260 --> 07:22.096
Ahem, no one's here.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.808
Oh, damn it.

07:39.947 --> 07:45.161
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

07:45.620 --> 07:48.289
- A little tall.
- What?

07:48.539 --> 07:51.083
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

07:53.961 --> 07:56.297
There you go.

07:57.924 --> 08:00.676
It's just so glamorous.

08:04.055 --> 08:05.806
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

08:07.183 --> 08:08.601
And you're still pregnant.

08:10.311 --> 08:13.356
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.566
- You know what? You look great.
- Aw.

08:15.816 --> 08:17.234
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

08:20.196 --> 08:26.077
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

08:27.912 --> 08:31.499
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

08:31.874 --> 08:36.921
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

08:37.087 --> 08:39.340
All right, stop it.

08:39.548 --> 08:41.509
- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
- Fine.

08:41.676 --> 08:42.717
Okay.

08:42.927 --> 08:47.014
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp right there?

08:49.850 --> 08:53.521
- Rachel here? We have an appointment.
- In the bathroom.

08:53.688 --> 08:56.941
- Rach, we gotta go.
- In a minute!

08:59.068 --> 09:02.905
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

09:04.699 --> 09:06.784
All right, all right, let's go.

09:06.951 --> 09:08.577
Uh, do you want to go change first?

09:08.828 --> 09:11.747
The doctor's keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry...

09:14.083 --> 09:17.712
- No, I'm fine.
- You don't think that's inappropriate?

09:18.254 --> 09:21.507
- What?
- Good God, man. Don't anger it.

09:25.219 --> 09:31.058
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am...

09:31.225 --> 09:34.895
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

09:35.062 --> 09:37.064
Uh-uh, pal! Don't call me "Mommy."

09:37.356 --> 09:39.233
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

09:41.777 --> 09:44.155
I'm actually with her on this one.

09:51.579 --> 09:54.248
I thought I knew who the enemy was...

09:54.415 --> 09:57.585
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

09:59.420 --> 10:03.174
I'm fighting for every
man in the 82nd Ground Division.

10:11.599 --> 10:12.767
- Ross?
- Yeah?

10:12.933 --> 10:15.186
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

10:15.436 --> 10:19.440
- When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
- Mm-hm?

10:19.940 --> 10:21.692
...were you this irritating?

10:25.613 --> 10:26.614
- Wow.
- Excuse me?

10:26.781 --> 10:28.365
Uh, nothing. You're just, uh...

10:28.532 --> 10:33.788
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

10:33.954 --> 10:36.791
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

10:38.209 --> 10:42.671
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

10:42.922 --> 10:44.215
Okay.

10:48.636 --> 10:50.596
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

10:55.309 --> 10:58.395
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows...

10:58.562 --> 11:03.067
...how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

11:06.487 --> 11:08.322
- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
- Hello.

11:08.531 --> 11:09.573
You're nice to her.

11:09.824 --> 11:11.117
She has the drugs.

11:13.702 --> 11:16.038
- We'll do a quick check.
- Okay.

11:16.247 --> 11:18.374
- Eight days late, huh?
- Yeah.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.042
You must be getting uncomfortable.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.837
Yeah, just a tad.

11:23.712 --> 11:28.717
You're 80 percent effaced.
You're on your way. It still could last a while.

11:28.968 --> 11:34.056
- There are ways to help things along.
- Do them!

11:35.015 --> 11:38.853
Actually, they're things
you can do. Home remedies.

11:39.019 --> 11:42.857
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

11:43.023 --> 11:48.070
- Well, we are ready to try anything.
- There's an herbal tea you can drink.

11:48.237 --> 11:49.280
Okay.

11:49.488 --> 11:52.533
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

11:52.741 --> 11:54.535
We will do all of those.

11:54.785 --> 11:57.121
- Taking a long walk.
- Good. Done.

11:57.371 --> 12:01.000
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

12:07.047 --> 12:09.008
You've got to be kidding me.

12:24.315 --> 12:27.526
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

12:28.194 --> 12:31.447
- You liked it'? You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah!

12:31.655 --> 12:36.160
- Well, which part exactly?
- The whole thing! Here we go!

12:36.368 --> 12:38.746
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

12:38.954 --> 12:43.000
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

12:43.209 --> 12:48.255
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

12:49.298 --> 12:54.929
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

12:55.930 --> 12:56.931
You fell asleep!

12:58.432 --> 13:03.145
There was no kangaroo!
They didn't take any of my suggestions!

13:05.940 --> 13:10.694
- Thanks for coming. See you later.
- Don't go. I'm so sorry.

13:10.945 --> 13:13.989
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

13:16.367 --> 13:18.244
Or call an ambulance!

13:21.664 --> 13:22.957
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

13:23.123 --> 13:27.044
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

13:27.211 --> 13:30.673
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

13:30.839 --> 13:32.258
We tried them all.

13:32.424 --> 13:38.222
We went for a walk, uh, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

13:38.472 --> 13:40.808
There is one thing we didn't try.

13:40.975 --> 13:45.104
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

13:45.312 --> 13:49.149
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today...

13:49.316 --> 13:50.442
...I think you should do it.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.030
- It's sex.
- Do it!

13:57.157 --> 14:00.828
- Monica.
- It's been a really long time for you.

14:01.036 --> 14:04.832
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.545
Oh, I don't know about that.

14:10.879 --> 14:17.219
I think if the two of you had sex,
the repercussions would be catastrophic.

14:18.178 --> 14:20.431
All right, let's be practical.

14:20.639 --> 14:24.935
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

14:26.937 --> 14:29.064
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

14:31.442 --> 14:33.610
Monica, what is the matter with you?

14:34.611 --> 14:38.115
- I just want the baby to be born today.
- Why today?

14:39.158 --> 14:41.035
Okay, fine.

14:41.493 --> 14:46.290
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

14:46.749 --> 14:52.129
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

14:52.338 --> 14:55.257
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

14:59.136 --> 15:02.681
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

15:02.848 --> 15:06.352
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

15:07.102 --> 15:08.771
Can I get some of that action?

15:09.688 --> 15:12.024
I'm betting against all of you?

15:12.232 --> 15:15.194
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

15:15.402 --> 15:17.154
Okay.

15:23.410 --> 15:26.622
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

15:26.789 --> 15:31.001
Where have you been?
I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.

15:31.251 --> 15:34.838
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

15:35.631 --> 15:36.965
I'm so sorry.

15:37.174 --> 15:41.011
The reason I came over is
to settle things between us.

15:41.178 --> 15:45.349
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.851
- So how much do I owe you?
- What?

15:48.102 --> 15:51.688
- I don't want to owe you anything.
- You don't owe me.

15:51.939 --> 15:54.483
- I don't want your...
- Ah, ah, ah. We're doing this!

15:54.691 --> 15:57.528
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

15:57.903 --> 16:02.199
- I don't know, uh, $500.
- Okay, $500. What else?

16:02.408 --> 16:07.204
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

16:08.288 --> 16:12.543
Okay, so that's another 500.
That's 500 and 500. That's...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.925
- You want a calculator?
- Please.

16:21.176 --> 16:22.886
Here.

16:25.347 --> 16:27.224
Oh.

16:27.391 --> 16:28.809
All right, what else?

16:29.017 --> 16:33.939
Well, uh, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes...

16:34.148 --> 16:37.067
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

16:37.276 --> 16:41.738
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

16:41.905 --> 16:45.409
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

16:47.286 --> 16:48.704
What the hell are you talking about?

16:48.871 --> 16:51.832
The South will rise again, man.

16:55.544 --> 16:58.255
- Yes, money well-spent.
- Yeah.

16:58.464 --> 17:00.632
Okay, what else? Rent.

17:00.883 --> 17:05.554
Uh, two, three years of rent,
utilities, food...

17:05.804 --> 17:10.309
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for...

17:11.310 --> 17:17.357
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

17:17.608 --> 17:18.817
How do you clear this thing?

17:24.906 --> 17:26.950
Finish your enchilada.

17:27.117 --> 17:31.121
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

17:31.288 --> 17:34.625
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

17:35.709 --> 17:42.049
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

17:42.633 --> 17:46.929
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

17:49.681 --> 17:53.268
- I am feeling nothing.
- Oh...

17:56.271 --> 17:59.399
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that...

17:59.566 --> 18:01.610
...really makes me want
to have sex with you.

18:03.695 --> 18:07.241
- Stop it.
- Come on! Why are we wasting time?

18:07.407 --> 18:11.954
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

18:12.120 --> 18:18.001
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

18:18.168 --> 18:21.171
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

18:21.338 --> 18:24.091
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

18:24.758 --> 18:28.262
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.931
Make love'? What are you, a girl?

18:33.725 --> 18:37.020
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

18:37.229 --> 18:41.817
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

18:41.984 --> 18:45.696
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

18:48.699 --> 18:50.993
I love when you talk dirty to me.

18:52.619 --> 18:56.248
Oh, I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

18:56.456 --> 18:59.543
Oh, oh. Whoops.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.795
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

19:03.422 --> 19:05.882
Let me just bend over and get it.

19:13.348 --> 19:14.891
Oh, God!

19:17.894 --> 19:21.398
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.234
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

19:24.443 --> 19:26.403
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

19:28.864 --> 19:31.783
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

19:33.452 --> 19:36.622
- You know what?
- What?

19:36.913 --> 19:38.915
Forget it.

19:39.833 --> 19:43.128
What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?

19:43.295 --> 19:47.049
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

19:47.299 --> 19:48.925
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

19:53.597 --> 19:57.809
I You'd think the jalapeño would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

19:58.060 --> 20:00.646
That's not enough...
What are you doing?

20:00.812 --> 20:02.397
I'm getting that baby out of you!

20:10.489 --> 20:12.324
- Oh, God!
- I know.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.701
Oh, no, no, no.

20:15.452 --> 20:17.037
I think my water just broke.

20:18.914 --> 20:21.667
I am good!

20:23.001 --> 20:27.130
Okay, I got the pillow. Uh, I got the bag.

20:27.297 --> 20:30.509
- You got the keys?
- I got the keys. Okay.

20:32.719 --> 20:34.888
- Hey.
- Yeah?

20:35.222 --> 20:36.973
We're having a baby.

20:50.362 --> 20:55.325
I didn't, uh, have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time...?

20:55.534 --> 20:58.412
- Not so much.
- Okay, let's go.

21:03.417 --> 21:04.668
- Two hundred.
- Thank you.

21:04.835 --> 21:08.797
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

21:09.005 --> 21:10.215
Okay.

21:12.092 --> 21:13.760
Hello?

21:15.011 --> 21:19.725
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.

21:21.268 --> 21:23.395
I guess we could bet one more time.

21:24.813 --> 21:27.649
- Is Rachel having the baby?
- How did you know that?

21:29.609 --> 21:32.779
- Joey! Chandler! It's time!
- They're at the coffee house.

21:32.988 --> 21:34.406
You know everything!

21:35.741 --> 21:39.119
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

21:40.287 --> 21:44.040
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

21:44.249 --> 21:47.961
- We know it's a girl.
- I'll give you really good odds.
