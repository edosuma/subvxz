[ raspberries ]

01:09.869 --> 01:12.403
What's this country
coming to, anyhow ?

01:12.471 --> 01:15.006
What is it, Archie ?
Bad news ?
What else ?

01:15.074 --> 01:17.008
We get out of Vietnam
or somethin' ?

01:18.711 --> 01:21.112
Don't be
a wise guy, huh ?

01:21.180 --> 01:23.247
It's them tamale eaters
out there in Los Angeles.

01:23.315 --> 01:26.384
They're riotin'
and fightin' with
them poor cops again.

01:26.451 --> 01:28.553
What do them
people want, anyhow ?

01:28.620 --> 01:32.323
Well, for one thing,
they don't want to be
called "tamale eaters."

01:32.391 --> 01:34.893
Just look at
that picture there.
Look at them.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.496
Throwin' bricks
and bottles. It's like
a regular "insurruption."

01:38.564 --> 01:41.032
They like to be called
"chicanos," all right ?

01:41.100 --> 01:45.036
Aw, who cares ?
What's in a name,
anyhow, huh ?

01:45.104 --> 01:47.538
In my day, nobody went around
callin' themselves chicanos,

01:47.606 --> 01:49.674
Mexican-Americans,
afro-Americans.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.843
We was all Americans !

01:51.911 --> 01:55.847
After that, if a guy
was a jig or a spick,
it was his own business.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.051
What do you mean,
"it was his own business" ?

02:00.119 --> 02:02.053
Certainly it was
his own business.

02:02.121 --> 02:05.556
If he wanted to hang out
with his own crowd--
which most of them did--

02:05.624 --> 02:07.592
that's how you got
your chinatowns, your harlems,

02:07.659 --> 02:09.594
your little Italy,
all them other "grettoes."

02:09.661 --> 02:12.997
So it's their fault
that you call 'em those names ?

02:13.065 --> 02:15.600
It ain't my fault, meathead.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.837
What's on
the idiot box ?

02:18.904 --> 02:22.006
It's only an idiot box
if an idiot is watching it.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.343
So don't peek.

[ Tv announcer ]
A boy needs your friendship--

Ah.
Hi.

About time youse

Where youse been, anyhow ?

Oh, we got back in time.
He's still in one
of his good moods.

02:43.629 --> 02:45.563
No, I ain't.

02:45.631 --> 02:48.900
I wake up here
on a Saturday morning,
I'm all alone.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.736
There's no note,
there's no nothin',
there's nobody here.

02:51.804 --> 02:55.940
- Mike was home.
- Like I said,
there was nobody here.

02:58.277 --> 03:00.945
On top of that, there ain't
a scrap of food to eat
in the house.

03:01.013 --> 03:04.048
Oh, I made you
a liverwurst and cheese
with some potato salad.

03:04.116 --> 03:06.985
It was right in the icebox.

03:07.052 --> 03:10.521
Oh. Was that for Archie ?

03:12.091 --> 03:14.025
You know something,
Gloria ?

03:14.093 --> 03:16.795
This husband of yours,
he eats like
a government mule.

03:16.862 --> 03:19.864
All right, Archie,
I'll fix you
something to eat.

03:19.932 --> 03:23.334
But first Gloria has
some wonderful news.

03:23.402 --> 03:25.436
We went to the doc--
all right, Edith,
not now.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.438
The picture
just started, huh ?

03:27.506 --> 03:30.441
Oh, that one you've seen
a hundred times.

03:30.509 --> 03:34.012
That's the one
about the football coach,
knute acne.

03:36.148 --> 03:39.017
Rockne, Edith, rockne,
and I ain't seen it
a hundred times.

03:39.084 --> 03:41.452
I seen it maybe four times.
So leave me alone.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.589
But, Archie, Gloria has
something to tell ya.

03:45.657 --> 03:47.658
Oh.

03:47.726 --> 03:49.694
Michael ?
Yeah ?

03:49.761 --> 03:52.763
Mom and I went to
the doctor this morning.
For her or for you ?

03:52.832 --> 03:55.633
For me. Would you
please close that ?
I wanna talk to you.

03:55.701 --> 03:58.336
You know I can't
walk by a refrigerator
without gettin' something.

03:58.403 --> 04:01.105
I don't want you
to get something now.
Give me that celery.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.674
No, no, no.
Let's talk.
All right, what is it ?

04:03.742 --> 04:06.711
You went to the doctor,
and it was for you,
it wasn't for your mother,

04:06.778 --> 04:10.048
and you got
a big surprise.
The biggest.

04:10.115 --> 04:12.350
Michael...

04:12.417 --> 04:14.518
I'm gonna have--
wait.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.555
I think I know
what the big surprise is.

04:18.623 --> 04:21.524
Do you think you could
hold off telling me
for just a second ?

04:21.593 --> 04:25.230
But why ?
I'm trying to think if it
could be anything else.

04:28.734 --> 04:31.669
Like what ?
Like you found a purse
in the doctor's office...

04:31.737 --> 04:34.372
With $300,000 in it.

04:34.439 --> 04:38.076
Then you gave the money
back to the lady. She was
so happy, she gave you half.

04:38.143 --> 04:40.778
Is that it ? It's not it ?
Is it close ?
No.

04:40.846 --> 04:43.414
Please tell me it's close.

04:43.482 --> 04:47.151
Oh, gee, Gloria !
Oh, what a thing !

04:47.219 --> 04:50.154
Oh, what am I gonna do ?
I-I can't take care of you !

04:50.222 --> 04:52.857
I can't take care
of a kid.
I don't have a job.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.159
I'm in college !
I don't even have
an apartment !

- Well, Michael--
- I know. You don't have
an apartment either !

No, Gloria, it's--
it's not another event.

It's the same event.

It's a blessed event.
Here, sit down.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.481
I'm supposed to
tell you to sit down.

05:17.549 --> 05:20.618

a hundred times. They
always tell the per--

I'm making it worse.

05:22.988 --> 05:24.956
I'm sorry, Gloria.
I made you miserable.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.358
Oh, Michael.
Don't worry about it.

05:27.426 --> 05:32.230
I know we can make it. Lots of
other young couples have babies
while they're going to school.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.999
There'll be plenty of time
to support us later.

with what you were doing.

While I think of it,
I wanna move some things here.

- What are you doing, mom ?
- Some of these cleaning fluids
are poison.

05:53.652 --> 05:56.154
You gotta keep 'em
out of a child's reach.

Come on, huh ?

You got a station break,
a public service announcement,

you think, daddy ?

When I see you
smilin' that way with all them

it cost me for braces.

the same way, well,
I figure it's gotta be gas.

06:56.248 --> 06:59.783
As for this guy here, I think
his underwear's too tight.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.056
Wrong on all counts !

If you're through, daddy,

No, mom and I went
to the doctor--

Archie, what if I
was to tell you...

07:18.837 --> 07:22.540
That I think you're going
to have the little boy...

it's gonna be wonderful,
and so convenient.

to hear the baby cry.

too tired,

08:34.712 --> 08:37.148
why, I can
get up, huh ?

08:37.216 --> 08:40.818
You can just
knock on the wall.
You're so thoughtful, mom.

something to do.

08:59.338 --> 09:04.041

another refrigerator
for all the extra baby things.

plenty of room.

ain't it, Archie ?

09:18.757 --> 09:20.691
"A miracle" !

09:20.759 --> 09:24.728
You give my daughter a baby,
and you can't even support
a goldfish.

09:24.796 --> 09:28.899
Archie, my reaction
was the same as yours.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.135
It was, huh ?

09:31.203 --> 09:34.004
Well, when are you
gonna help me choke you ?

09:35.140 --> 09:37.074
I-I'm tellin' you, Archie.

09:37.142 --> 09:39.310
I'm as worried
about this as you are.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.712
That ain't good enough !
You gotta be worried more !

09:42.847 --> 09:44.848
When I married Edith,
when we had Gloria,

09:44.916 --> 09:48.486
I not only had
an apartment and a job
but 925 bucks in the bank !

09:48.554 --> 09:50.555
I know, I know,
but what do you want ?

09:50.622 --> 09:53.123
It's just one
of those things.
"Just one of those things."

09:53.192 --> 09:56.126
I might have known
it was gonna happen
the way you carry on !

09:56.195 --> 09:59.863
You're always pinchin'
and touchin' each other
like you was pickin' fruit !

09:59.931 --> 10:03.867
Your whole generation
does nothin' but think
with its glands !

10:03.935 --> 10:06.070
All right,
that's it, that's it !

10:06.137 --> 10:08.472
When I first
found out about it,
I was feelin' guilty.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.242
But after listenin'
to you, I'm startin'
to feel damn proud !

10:11.310 --> 10:14.245
"Proud" ? Can you
put <i>proud</i> in the bank ?

10:14.313 --> 10:16.780
How you gonna
support that baby ?
I can do it.

10:16.848 --> 10:19.483
I'm not set up to
'cause I'm in school.
I could be workin'.

10:19.551 --> 10:21.552
Workin' ? You ?
Yeah !

10:21.620 --> 10:25.223
I'll believe that
when the 59th street bridge
grows leaves.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.958
You start believin' it
right now, pal,

10:28.026 --> 10:29.960
because that's it,
I'm quittin' school !

10:30.028 --> 10:32.062
Quitting school ?
Michael, no !
No, no.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.398
I'm getting a job
and taking care
of you myself.

10:34.466 --> 10:37.635
I think I know where
I can get an apartment.
But you can't quit school.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.471
You've gotta get your degree.
It's important
to your future.

10:40.539 --> 10:43.241
Archie, you gotta put
a stop to that right now.

10:43.308 --> 10:46.310
I've heard
this song and dance before.
If they wanna go, let 'em go.

10:46.378 --> 10:50.914
But they can't leave.
The doctor says she ain't
gonna have an easy time.

10:50.982 --> 10:53.551
The doctor should have
told that to him !

10:53.619 --> 10:56.554
Oh, but, Archie,
we gotta stick by 'em,

10:56.622 --> 10:58.656
at least until
Mike graduates.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.425
A boy today
needs a degree...

11:01.493 --> 11:03.561
If he's gonna
get anywhere.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.264
I never had no degree,
and I always held up my end.

11:06.331 --> 11:09.634
Well, it might have been
higher with a degree.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.636
What ?
Your end.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.405
Stop torturing me,
will ya, Edith !

Oh, I-I thought
I knew you,
Archie bunker,

11:18.410 --> 11:23.046
but I never thought
you'd act this way
about your own grandchild.

11:23.114 --> 11:26.150
Come on, Edith.
Now, don't make me out
no monster, huh ?

11:26.217 --> 11:28.653
I'm tryin' to think of the way
they're hurtin' themselves.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.688
I'm tryin' to think of
the financials of this thing.

Oh, you know
what I think ?

I think you don't want
a baby around the house.

You don't like babies !

11:37.596 --> 11:39.764
That's a lie.

When Gloria was a baby
and cryin' in the middle
of the night, who got up ?

11:45.570 --> 11:48.773
I did.
I mean after that.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.542
When she was cryin'
four or five times
during the night.

11:51.610 --> 11:56.146
I did.
Well, who said, "Edith,
Edith, the baby's cryin'" ?

11:56.214 --> 11:58.916
That was you.

11:58.983 --> 12:03.721
All right,
that's what I'm sayin'.
I was up as often as you.

He did it ! He did it !
Michael got us an apartment !

12:07.926 --> 12:09.927
A friend of his
got transferred to Detroit,

12:09.994 --> 12:12.763
and we get the first
two months' rent free !

12:12.831 --> 12:16.300
And he's gonna get a job,
and he's going to night school,

I have triplets !

What brings you here
so early ?

13:00.311 --> 13:02.346
Oh, I just brought
something by for Gloria.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.749
Oh, how nice !

13:04.816 --> 13:06.751
When mom heard Gloria
was havin' a hard time,

13:06.818 --> 13:08.753
she figured this
would be just the thing.

13:08.820 --> 13:12.055
I thought I'd bring it by
on my way to school.
Smells like chicken soup.

13:12.123 --> 13:15.526
It is.
Mom's a great believer
in chicken soup.

doesn't that
strike you funny ?

No. Why ?
She ain't Jewish.

Well, I ain't Jewish,
and I'm a great believer
in chicken soup.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.076
You know,
I wonder how chicken soup
came to be theirs.

13:36.915 --> 13:40.651
Beats me. You know,
my dad often wonders how
pork chops got to be ours.

What are you
doin' here so early ?

Lionel's mother
heard that Gloria
wasn't feelin' too good,

13:52.297 --> 13:55.365
so she sent over
some food--
a nice pot of--

Hey, Archie,
did you switch from a brush
to a spray can shaving cream ?

14:17.388 --> 14:19.790
I did.
What's it to ya ?
Oh, nothin'.

14:19.858 --> 14:23.160
Except the spray can you bought
looked a lot like my deodorant.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.297
Oh, now don't tell me
that you--

14:31.703 --> 14:34.338
last week, I reached for
the liquid hair net,

14:34.405 --> 14:37.541
and I sprayed my head
with room deodorizer.

14:39.811 --> 14:44.448
All day long
I reminded myself
of the great outdoors.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.120
I told you
before, Edith.

14:50.188 --> 14:53.123
You gotta do somethin'
about all them spray cans
in that bathroom.

14:53.191 --> 14:56.159
I know.
This sounds
just like my house.

14:56.227 --> 14:59.463
Oh, yeah ? And how
do you people handle
a problem like that, Lionel ?

14:59.531 --> 15:01.499

15:01.566 --> 15:03.634
I mean, with eight people
usin' an apartment-- families--

15:03.702 --> 15:05.769
and 20 people
sharin' a bathroom now ?

15:05.837 --> 15:08.706
Oh, well, first,
it's only four families
to an apartment,

15:08.773 --> 15:11.642
and only 16 people
sharin' a bathroom.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.879
And, anyway, what we do
is we take all our spray cans...

15:14.946 --> 15:17.414
And shove 'em
onto special shelves.

15:17.482 --> 15:21.318
So, what you could do is...
Shove yours.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.501
You know, a guy could
take that two ways.

15:39.370 --> 15:43.340
Yeah, but knowin' Lionel,
I think he only meant it
one way.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.577
Oh, yeah.
He's a good kid.

15:49.180 --> 15:53.717

talk to Mike about stayin' ?
