00:16.750 --> 00:18.920
Based on real events

00:19.450 --> 00:21.530
1985

00:25.330 --> 00:27.500
Grab the Arab. I'll get the fag!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
So, you little fag...

00:36.160 --> 00:37.990
Where can you go now?

00:38.790 --> 00:40.580
What'll you do now?

00:41.370 --> 00:44.120
You made me run.
Why did you make me run?

00:47.330 --> 00:48.830
Shut up, dirty Ay-rab!

00:54.370 --> 00:56.870
- Where's the other fucker?
- He got away.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.380
Fuck.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.030
"Don't touch my pal" -
what a shitty motto!

01:03.200 --> 01:05.660
Look.
I'm touching you, aren't I?

01:06.450 --> 01:10.450
I'm touching you!
Where's your pal now?

01:11.290 --> 01:13.670
Stop it. We've done nothing to you!

01:16.040 --> 01:18.330
Shut your mouth, you fucking Arab!

01:19.830 --> 01:22.000
Look at this pile of shit.

01:27.830 --> 01:31.040
This is France. Do you understand?

01:33.290 --> 01:36.250
France is no place
for fags, Arabs and commies.

01:36.410 --> 01:40.200
Go tell your little friends.
France belongs to us.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.120
Let's get outta here.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.460
Down, Grand-Guy, down!

02:09.830 --> 02:11.080
Come here.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.580
Look at that.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.000
Fucker!

02:16.160 --> 02:18.120
Fuckin' Mandela!

02:20.950 --> 02:23.620
- I'm sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

02:23.790 --> 02:26.540
He walks straight into me.
What d'ya want?

02:26.700 --> 02:29.120
- Hey, Malcolm X.
- Black power!

02:29.290 --> 02:31.580
Get down! Down!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.420
On the ground!

02:33.580 --> 02:35.290
Here's your glasses.

02:35.450 --> 02:38.070
Take 'em and stick 'em up your ass!

02:38.250 --> 02:40.710
- Up your ass!
- Now scram.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.080
Scram!

02:49.290 --> 02:51.420
I'll smash your face in.

03:03.870 --> 03:05.490
Hi, folks!

03:06.620 --> 03:07.620
'Evening!

03:14.700 --> 03:17.780
Innkeeper, 3 beers!

03:31.120 --> 03:32.570
Look, guys...

03:34.000 --> 03:37.130
The beer's on me.
Drink it and be on your way.

03:37.790 --> 03:40.750
- I want no trouble.
- Is this the Salvation Army?

03:40.910 --> 03:42.240
Just go.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.620
We'll go when we feel like it.

03:46.830 --> 03:50.040
Can't we have a quiet beer here?

03:50.200 --> 03:53.530
- Are those Ay-rabs your family?
- They're customers.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.240
Drink up.
Look, there's no problem.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.290
Yeah, there's no problem.

04:19.829 --> 04:23.500
You speak French here, OK?
Stand up, you.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.540
Take your hat off.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.670
Up against the wall.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.830
We'll teach 'em a song we like.
Hands on hearts.

04:31.450 --> 04:33.660
Look proud. Grand-Guy...

04:33.830 --> 04:37.420
Arise, children of... Come on.

04:37.580 --> 04:42.170
Arise, children of the Fatherland

04:42.330 --> 04:43.830
Marco!

04:45.700 --> 04:49.320
What'll you do now? Cut my throat?

04:50.370 --> 04:52.370
Shut your mouth.

04:52.540 --> 04:54.130
Shut your fucking mouth!

04:54.290 --> 04:55.920
Want me to kill ya?

04:56.080 --> 04:58.630
- Stop it!
- Want me to kill ya?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.790
Marc!

05:33.580 --> 05:34.670
What?

05:36.700 --> 05:37.950
What?

05:43.450 --> 05:45.660
- Marc!
- What?

05:55.370 --> 05:57.950
Fuck, you're drunk again.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.540
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dad!

06:19.620 --> 06:22.450
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Get a towel.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.160
Where are you going?

08:22.950 --> 08:24.660
What the fuck are you doing?

08:25.450 --> 08:27.200
Are you wasted?

08:28.870 --> 08:31.030
Fuckin' beat it!

08:31.200 --> 08:34.200
- You a fag or what?
- He's no bother.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.240
He is to me.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.630
- You're no fun.
- No, I'm not.

09:05.910 --> 09:07.950
1988

09:10.580 --> 09:12.380
Stand down, Mitterrand.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.130
Socialism = Defeat.

09:27.620 --> 09:28.950
Hey, Grand-Guy...

09:29.910 --> 09:33.320
- Give us a hand.
- There's only 3 to put up.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.670
Want me to help you piss?

09:35.830 --> 09:36.960
Pain in the ass!

09:37.120 --> 09:38.160
Marvin!

09:38.330 --> 09:39.630
You're dead!

09:39.790 --> 09:41.790
Come on, you bastard!

09:59.830 --> 10:01.630
Want some more?

10:02.080 --> 10:04.710
You little commie, come to Daddy!

10:11.250 --> 10:14.880
This is our patch, d'ya understand?

10:19.200 --> 10:23.530
Tell Zipper we ain't gonna give up.
You won't have a patch soon!

10:24.120 --> 10:26.320
You're dead, you Nazis!

10:32.160 --> 10:34.320
Beat it or I'll kill ya!

10:40.450 --> 10:42.030
Victory!

10:45.120 --> 10:47.530
We gotta get outta here now.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.700
Move it, Marvin.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.030
- Don't we finish up?
- They'll do it tonight.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.250
Take the stuff.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.700
Ow, fuck!

11:39.700 --> 11:41.910
Were they the Archangel guys?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.420
I don't think so.

11:43.580 --> 11:47.670
That black bastard
is Mamath's kid brother, I think.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.080
Are you sure?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.460
Don't you listen?
I said I wasn't sure.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.670
Calm down, guys.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.910
Put your lights on!

12:17.370 --> 12:19.160
- Hey, Grand-Guy.
- Hi.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.780
- What happened?
- The Reds got us.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.410
We beat the fuckers up!

12:24.580 --> 12:25.830
- You OK?
- Yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.670
- Who did it?
- Reds.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.250
- Yeah, but who?
- Fuckin' Reds!

12:31.790 --> 12:34.630
- You're bleeding.
- Fuck, I know!

14:08.080 --> 14:11.380
The punks have showed up.
Come on!

14:20.410 --> 14:21.780
Sonovabitch!

14:30.700 --> 14:33.620
Beat him up, beat him up!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.500
Fuckin' Nazis!

14:37.660 --> 14:38.990
Jean-Mi!

14:42.620 --> 14:44.160
Fuck off, you!

14:44.330 --> 14:46.330
I'll kill ya!

14:48.040 --> 14:49.880
Zipper!

14:50.330 --> 14:51.380
Fuckin' skins!

14:51.540 --> 14:54.920
Call an ambulance! Quick!

15:00.250 --> 15:02.210
Look at me, look at me!

15:08.540 --> 15:09.920
Hey, Zipper!

15:16.790 --> 15:21.170
His mother won't let him live with me.
She says I'm too old for him.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.460
She's right, you are!

15:25.660 --> 15:28.240
Maybe in 20 years' time,
but who cares now?

15:32.580 --> 15:34.290
I'll be dead by then.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.250
Don't talk crap.

15:43.580 --> 15:46.380
Do you want to come live with me?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.040
I live above you.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.880
I mean, really live with me.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.380
What about Marvin?

15:55.910 --> 15:58.120
- How'd he take it?
- Badly.

15:58.910 --> 16:00.740
He's so jealous.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.500
You're a real pest!

16:04.250 --> 16:06.040
Behave. No.

16:06.750 --> 16:11.000
Hold him tight
Dirty, salty kisses.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.820
Falling onto the bed
It's a first.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.710
He loves madly In slow motion.

16:20.870 --> 16:23.530
He breaks taboos.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.990
- Stop it.
- Are you hard?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.410
- Go.
- Why?

16:28.580 --> 16:30.500
- Meet you at Zipper's.
- Why?

16:30.660 --> 16:32.070
Do as I say.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.700
Look who it is.

16:42.870 --> 16:44.320
What do you want?

16:45.290 --> 16:48.130
- Not so brave on your own!
- I'm not on my own.

16:48.290 --> 16:52.250
What's the problem? That little whore?
Is she your chick?

16:52.410 --> 16:55.820
- Not now...
- I'd love to fuck that little bitch.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.950
Or does she prefer being screwed
by Nazis like you?

17:00.830 --> 17:05.250
We don't want you lot. You don't deserve
to be called skinheads.

17:05.410 --> 17:09.160
- You finished?
- We'll never have finished with you!

17:11.200 --> 17:15.069
- We'll do this some other time.
- Stay here, bastard!

17:15.250 --> 17:18.000
- Stop it.
- Stay here, fucker!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.540
What do you want?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.790
What do you want?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.130
Is that what you want, you fucker?

18:56.450 --> 18:58.240
Police! Freeze!

18:58.410 --> 18:59.780
Freeze.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.790
Get in.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.960
Sit here.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.750
Sit down and take off your shoes.

20:28.370 --> 20:29.870
Is he dead?

20:31.830 --> 20:33.000
No.

20:36.290 --> 20:37.670
You're lucky.

20:40.450 --> 20:42.450
But you beat him up badly.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.710
He started it.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.040
What the hell do I care?

20:53.750 --> 20:54.790
Can I have a drink?

20:57.620 --> 20:59.620
Are you a butcher's apprentice?

21:01.750 --> 21:03.130
OK...

21:03.750 --> 21:07.080
What are you? What kind of skinhead?

21:08.120 --> 21:10.700
Which gang? Nazis or reds?

21:13.660 --> 21:15.780
We have better things to do

21:15.950 --> 21:19.120
than deal with assholes like you,
so what are you?

21:26.540 --> 21:27.580
Who's she?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.130
Do you know her?

21:30.830 --> 21:32.380
Is she your girlfriend?

21:32.660 --> 21:34.320
Did you fight over her?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.580
What's your problem?

22:35.750 --> 22:37.460
What're you looking at?

22:38.160 --> 22:38.870
What?

22:39.700 --> 22:42.410
Don't look at me! Fucker!

22:49.540 --> 22:51.170
What're you looking at?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.490
Look at your father!

23:10.830 --> 23:12.170
Get lost.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.070
Get lost!

23:14.450 --> 23:16.200
Filthy race.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.990
Get lost, go on, get lost.

23:30.330 --> 23:31.580
What?

24:21.660 --> 24:24.070
Excuse me, I don't feel good.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.710
What is it?

24:26.870 --> 24:28.070
I don't know.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.570
Have a seat.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.290
You're having trouble breathing?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.570
- Has it happened before?
- No.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.210
You don't have any allergies?

25:05.370 --> 25:06.820
I don't think so.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.460
Take this.

25:26.830 --> 25:28.080
More.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.290
Ah, Mrs. Duteil, I hadn't seen you
today. I missed you!

25:35.790 --> 25:38.040
What's your poison?!

25:45.410 --> 25:47.240
I'll get that for you.

25:50.450 --> 25:51.700
Come with me.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.080
Sit down there.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.920
Wait till it takes effect.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.820
It'll only take about 15 minutes.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.080
Relax.

26:29.040 --> 26:33.250
Read a magazine if you like.
If you don't feel OK, call me.

26:40.580 --> 26:41.960
OK, over to you.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.500
Have you eaten, son?

27:04.040 --> 27:07.750
I kept you some chicken
and peppers, your favorite.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.870
1992

28:43.250 --> 28:44.830
Got a light?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.620
We were waiting for you.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.080
- 'Evening.
- Welcome.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.540
Hello. Happy New Year.

29:02.330 --> 29:03.960
Everything OK?

29:05.540 --> 29:07.500
Was it this quiet last year?

29:07.910 --> 29:09.660
Yeah, I think so.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.540
Happy New Year!

29:12.200 --> 29:15.320
- Happy New Year, man.
- Happy New Year, lovebirds.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.540
- OK?
- Great.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.030
Happy New Year.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.120
Happy New Year.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.000
- Have fun.
- 'Night.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.580
I like them.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.820
Don't touch me!

29:35.750 --> 29:37.580
Who does he think he is?

29:48.830 --> 29:50.290
Asshole.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.450
'Evening, gentlemen.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.330
Hey now.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.460
It's a private party.
Do you have an invitation?

30:02.620 --> 30:04.320
We know Saïd. Let us in.

30:04.830 --> 30:07.790
I don't know Saïd.
You need an invitation.

30:07.950 --> 30:09.820
It's party time. Let us in.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.570
No, you'll have to leave, gentlemen.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.130
What do you want?

30:15.290 --> 30:17.460
You want an invitation?

30:18.250 --> 30:22.250
How's that for an invitation?
Is that OK for you?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.870
What's your problem?

30:26.370 --> 30:28.450
Why are you looking at me like that?

30:30.700 --> 30:32.200
It's OK.

30:33.450 --> 30:34.870
Just you try!

30:45.450 --> 30:47.370
Hello and welcome.

30:47.790 --> 30:49.290
Hey, fucker!

30:52.540 --> 30:53.960
Marco!

30:55.790 --> 30:57.250
Help!

30:58.410 --> 31:01.030
- What happened?
- I don't know.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.080
Oh, fuck!

31:04.250 --> 31:06.790
Call an ambulance. Calou!

31:07.500 --> 31:09.540
- It's OK.
- What is it?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.120
Press on it with your hand!

31:13.870 --> 31:15.120
Stop!

31:15.290 --> 31:17.080
Hold my hand.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.160
Alright, sonny?

31:35.580 --> 31:37.420
You gave me such a fright.

31:39.750 --> 31:41.750
It's OK, Mom, don't worry.

31:45.910 --> 31:47.740
It's alright, Mom.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.530
Is it a boy or a girl?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.670
What's that, sonny?

32:20.620 --> 32:21.870
Nothing.

32:36.950 --> 32:38.950
- Mom...
- Yes?

32:42.750 --> 32:45.880
Did you tell me bedtime stories
when I was little?

32:50.120 --> 32:51.200
Yes.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.210
I don't remember.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.080
Hello, ma'am.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.570
Hello, sir.

33:17.910 --> 33:19.160
So?

33:19.950 --> 33:21.030
How are you?

33:23.080 --> 33:24.330
Why are you here?

33:24.580 --> 33:28.040
The ambulance people called me.
You gave them my name.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.950
Really?

33:53.790 --> 33:55.500
Thanks for coming.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.830
Mom, can I have some water?

34:08.909 --> 34:10.409
Give it to me.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.710
But, in fact,

34:20.870 --> 34:23.120
ladies and gentlemen, the worst thing

34:23.449 --> 34:28.409
is not that this bunch of gangsters
and racketeers line their pockets.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.960
It's shocking for justice,

34:31.699 --> 34:33.320
but still...

34:33.500 --> 34:36.420
The worst thing is,
they're emptying ours.

34:37.250 --> 34:40.920
They leave us defenseless,
without social welfare.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.870
Our grandmothers are killed.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.540
Our storekeepers are murdered,
as happened near here a few days ago.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.239
Need I remind you?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.739
What'll happen if we don't do anything?

34:54.080 --> 34:58.040
How many murders will it take
for them to understand?

34:58.200 --> 35:03.030
Just to understand
that it's always the same people.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
It always is.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.950
I'm not afraid to say so.
It's always the blacks

35:09.120 --> 35:11.070
or the Arabs. Sorry, but it is.

35:11.250 --> 35:15.130
I know it's not the done thing
to say that at the moment.

35:15.290 --> 35:18.670
All those mayors who stop us
holding our meetings,

35:18.830 --> 35:22.750
like in Lyon with Michel Noir.
Black by name...!

35:23.700 --> 35:26.490
Or in Grenoble and elsewhere.

35:26.660 --> 35:29.370
All the mayors who claim that our ideas

35:29.540 --> 35:32.920
are crimes, not opinions.

35:33.080 --> 35:36.330
There'll soon be
50 million criminals in France!

35:42.750 --> 35:43.960
France

35:44.120 --> 35:46.780
has a history. So does our party.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.130
We don't have a short memory, us.

35:50.290 --> 35:53.330
France isn't Islam or the Koran.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.630
France isn't Africa.

35:56.790 --> 36:01.080
France is Charlemagne,
Charles Martel, Charles Maurras!

36:01.250 --> 36:05.960
France isn't François Mitterrand
or his prime minister Bérégovoy!

36:06.910 --> 36:10.620
The State has the nerve
to take Jean-Marie Le Pen to court

36:10.790 --> 36:14.000
for incitement to racial hatred.

36:14.450 --> 36:15.620
Imagine that.

36:15.790 --> 36:17.790
What does the State do

36:17.950 --> 36:23.370
when all those North Africans last week
in Nice marched and proclaimed

36:23.540 --> 36:29.040
that they would
"ruin our race and kill us all"?

36:30.450 --> 36:32.740
What can we do in return?

36:32.910 --> 36:35.780
Keep our heads down? Is that it?

36:35.950 --> 36:38.950
Say nothing? Let ourselves be insulted?

36:39.120 --> 36:42.990
Personally, I won't let anyone
insult my country.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.660
I won't let anyone insult our country.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.750
I won't let anyone insult France!

36:52.450 --> 36:56.700
A new order is underway.
The true French must stand up,

36:56.870 --> 37:00.740
as Marshall Pétain stood up,
and have the courage to tell the vermin

37:00.910 --> 37:03.030
that they've had their fun.

37:03.200 --> 37:08.120
It's time they go home or are
sent home with their barbaric religion.

37:08.290 --> 37:13.040
We French must tell them
that this is our home!

37:13.700 --> 37:15.160
Jean-Michel!

37:19.580 --> 37:21.130
My friends,

37:21.290 --> 37:24.380
we all thank
Jean-Michel Cayrol once more.

37:24.540 --> 37:28.880
Let's continue this discussion
less formally

37:29.040 --> 37:32.330
outside where refreshments
will be served.

37:55.370 --> 37:56.700
Excuse me.

37:57.250 --> 38:02.210
Do you think the voting recommendations
will be followed by everyone?

38:02.370 --> 38:03.870
Of course.

38:07.870 --> 38:12.280
Absolutely. Unless agreements
can be made.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.320
You know as well as I do

38:14.500 --> 38:17.920
certain things must be said
at the conference.

38:18.450 --> 38:19.570
For the press.

38:19.750 --> 38:23.830
But you won't consider
standing down for Jacquelin?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Never! I swear.

38:26.160 --> 38:30.280
Between you and me, if I get the chance,
I'll spit in his face.

38:30.450 --> 38:35.740
Like in nature, pests need stamping out.
But don't worry, I won't stand down.

38:35.910 --> 38:39.370
Let's hope so.
That swine should go.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.410
No, stop it!

38:46.700 --> 38:48.240
Stop it!

38:49.160 --> 38:50.370
Hello.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.740
I saw you looking at me.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.830
- I'm Corinne.
- I'm Marc.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.950
- Can you pour me a drink?
- Sure. Red wine?

39:04.120 --> 39:05.620
Yes, alright.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.950
Thanks.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.380
You're not having one?

39:14.540 --> 39:15.750
I am.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.420
Cheers.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.570
Is that for me?

39:29.580 --> 39:30.960
Are you local?

39:31.120 --> 39:33.780
Not really. I live in Corbeil.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.170
My uncle organized the meeting.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.160
This is his house.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.080
I see.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.290
'Scuse me.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.450
- Beautiful.
- Who is?

39:48.620 --> 39:49.820
The house.

39:50.370 --> 39:51.700
Yes, it is.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.000
I was thirsty.

40:01.830 --> 40:06.040
It's rare to find people
with convictions nowadays, isn't it?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.450
Yes, it is.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.660
- Is he your friend?
- Who?

40:11.830 --> 40:14.170
- Jean-Michel.
- Yes.

40:14.330 --> 40:15.580
Yes...

40:16.910 --> 40:18.240
We grew up together.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.030
My uncle likes him a lot.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.370
He has high hopes for him.

40:27.620 --> 40:28.780
Another?

40:28.950 --> 40:30.200
Yes, please.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.280
Cheers.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.620
- Everything alright?
- Everything's fine.

40:42.450 --> 40:44.160
Hey, you three!

40:45.290 --> 40:48.670
Take the ball and go behind the house!

40:50.620 --> 40:52.410
Thanks a lot.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.290
Hey, pay some attention to me!

41:01.080 --> 41:04.420
The creep has no education.
You couldn't find worse!

41:04.580 --> 41:06.460
You're talking about my pal.

41:06.620 --> 41:09.870
Go sober up, you drunk!
I'll talk how I like!

41:10.040 --> 41:13.670
I know him better than you,
so shut your trap, you jerk!

41:13.830 --> 41:16.080
Well, I like your pal!

41:16.250 --> 41:17.830
Oh, yeah?

41:18.200 --> 41:20.240
Hear me? I like you.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.910
Do you like me a bit?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.330
Sure I do.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.420
What do you think of me?

41:35.200 --> 41:37.780
You're pretty... Pretty.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.160
- Is he always like that?
- No, he's on form.

41:41.330 --> 41:44.250
Talkative even.
Usually he's more uptight!

41:44.540 --> 41:46.630
Oh, right!

41:46.790 --> 41:49.420
Don't listen to these females!

41:50.290 --> 41:53.290
- Save your breath.
- "These females"!

42:06.450 --> 42:08.780
Look what we found hanging around!

42:14.580 --> 42:16.210
Where was that ape?

42:16.370 --> 42:18.410
Drunk on a bench by City Hall.

42:19.660 --> 42:21.070
I'll fall off!

42:21.250 --> 42:22.880
Let's give him a drink.

42:26.330 --> 42:29.630
Show him we're not savages... us!

42:32.620 --> 42:36.370
Drink, drink, drink!

42:47.830 --> 42:49.670
Maybe something stronger?

42:52.200 --> 42:53.740
Pass the caustic soda.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.370
Guy! Don't be stupid.

43:11.540 --> 43:14.290
It's OK, don't worry.
It's just for a joke!

43:14.450 --> 43:15.530
He's had enough.

43:16.870 --> 43:18.320
C'mon, stop it.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.740
Drink, drink, drink!

43:32.450 --> 43:34.070
Get that outta here.

43:36.950 --> 43:40.200
I don't want that shit dying in my bar.
Get it out.

43:59.830 --> 44:01.580
Gimme a beer.

44:13.910 --> 44:15.910
Careful, that rock's loose.

44:21.410 --> 44:22.660
Thanks.

44:51.700 --> 44:53.660
Oh, shit!

45:52.700 --> 45:55.240
- So, what's it like?
- Great!

45:55.870 --> 45:58.200
- No, really?
- Freezing!

45:58.870 --> 46:00.160
You're insane!

46:00.910 --> 46:03.280
No, it does you good. Come on.

46:04.700 --> 46:06.240
- Come on!
- No.

46:26.790 --> 46:29.790
When I was young,
English shoes were in fashion.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.580
Not quite the same model though.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.820
Mine were easier to take off.

46:37.540 --> 46:39.330
I had a pair of Barker's.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.080
I don't know if it still exists.

46:43.330 --> 46:45.170
My wife gave them to me.

46:46.830 --> 46:51.000
Handmade brown and ostrich Puccinis.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.380
They were a bit flashy.
My wife liked them.

46:57.450 --> 46:59.160
I don't know where they are.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.780
I must've left them somewhere.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.120
What size are you?

47:08.040 --> 47:10.880
- 11.
- They should fit.

47:11.870 --> 47:13.870
If I find them, they're yours.

47:15.790 --> 47:17.380
Can I have a cigarette?

47:37.910 --> 47:40.990
You didn't look too good
the first time I saw you.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.460
True.

47:45.750 --> 47:47.750
People never look good

47:47.910 --> 47:49.320
when I first see them.

47:50.870 --> 47:53.780
Trembling, clutching their prescription.

48:00.910 --> 48:04.820
People are all the same:
They just want some relief.

48:05.870 --> 48:09.240
You thought you were dying
of a heart attack.

48:09.410 --> 48:11.200
Half a pill sorted you out.

48:13.830 --> 48:15.540
You just got a fright.

48:17.410 --> 48:19.320
People are nice, you know.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.790
They're nice when they're frightened.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.280
Or when they're in pain.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.380
Let's try what the doctor ordered.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.620
What's that?

48:45.290 --> 48:47.040
The wine, dummy!

48:48.620 --> 48:50.070
I'll open it.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.670
Listen to this.

49:03.830 --> 49:06.880
"Behind every man now alive
stand 30 ghosts,"

49:07.620 --> 49:10.030
for that is the ratio of dead to living.

49:11.910 --> 49:16.280
Since the dawn of time, 100 billion
humans have lived on this planet.

49:17.290 --> 49:19.330
Now this is an interesting number,

49:19.790 --> 49:21.330
for coincidentally,

49:21.500 --> 49:26.080
there are about 100 billion stars
in our local universe, the Milky Way.

49:27.120 --> 49:31.450
So, for every man who has ever lived,
a star shines in space.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.910
Every one of those stars is a sun,

49:39.290 --> 49:43.330
often far more brilliant
than the small nearby star

49:43.500 --> 49:45.290
we call the sun.

49:45.910 --> 49:49.410
Many stars in the Milky Way,
probably most

49:49.580 --> 49:51.920
have planets surrounding them.

49:52.540 --> 49:55.210
So, there no doubt exists
in the universe

49:55.370 --> 49:58.660
enough worlds to give
all humans, past and present,

49:58.830 --> 50:02.210
"his own private heaven or hell."

51:06.330 --> 51:08.170
- Here, my love.
- Thanks.

51:10.080 --> 51:12.130
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

51:41.620 --> 51:42.950
It's Bambi!

51:46.450 --> 51:49.320
Hello. Yes, speaking.

51:52.410 --> 51:55.490
I'm ashamed to see you in this state.

51:55.660 --> 51:57.370
Now look! Show me your arm.

51:57.540 --> 52:00.000
- Hey, cool it.
- Shut your trap, you.

52:01.620 --> 52:02.820
Fuck!

52:05.910 --> 52:07.450
Turn the music off.

52:07.910 --> 52:10.120
My friends, watch this.

52:10.950 --> 52:15.030
The 1995 presidential elections
have been relatively peaceful.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.700
The serious incidents
over the course of the campaign...

52:19.790 --> 52:21.290
Hey, beautiful.

52:23.790 --> 52:25.250
- You OK?
- Yeah.

52:25.950 --> 52:28.450
Ibrahim Ali, aged 17, was killed

52:28.620 --> 52:31.240
in February
by Front National activists.

52:31.410 --> 52:32.910
It's Bambi!

52:34.330 --> 52:37.170
He was shot
by 3 Front National militants.

52:37.330 --> 52:40.080
The 3 men were indicted for homicide.

52:40.250 --> 52:44.040
Deputy leader, Bruno Mégret
described it as self-defense.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.530
One of our members was
violently attacked by 15 Comorians.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.280
His 2 friends who were nearby

52:51.450 --> 52:55.070
came to his rescue
and acted in self-defense.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.490
Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen

53:00.120 --> 53:02.740
made this homicide
a political argument,

53:02.910 --> 53:05.660
but prefers to call it an accident.

53:05.830 --> 53:12.460
This accident
a few weeks ago in Marseille

53:12.620 --> 53:18.160
nevertheless had the advantage
of revealing to the people of Marseille

53:19.160 --> 53:22.280
who ignored this fact
that there are

53:22.450 --> 53:25.530
50,000 Comorians in Marseille.

53:25.790 --> 53:28.130
Now that's what I call news!

53:29.410 --> 53:32.910
Yesterday in Paris,
a young Moroccan drowned

53:33.080 --> 53:37.290
after being pushed in the Seine by
skinheads at the Front National march.

53:37.620 --> 53:40.950
Jean-Marie Le Pen
refers to it as an incident.

53:41.330 --> 53:45.540
No-one knows the cause
of this incident which was

53:45.700 --> 53:50.370
nothing to do with the Joan of Arc march
by the Front National.

53:50.540 --> 53:55.790
Some see these incidents,
accidents or murders as mere details

53:55.950 --> 53:58.030
in the Front National's history.

53:58.660 --> 53:59.990
Turn it off.

54:00.620 --> 54:05.910
I would like to raise my glass
to the health of our brave comrades

54:06.080 --> 54:09.670
who defended France's honor
by ridding us of that vermin.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.880
And I would like us to spare a thought

54:16.040 --> 54:20.170
for our friend and brother Grand-Guy
whom some of you knew.

54:20.330 --> 54:23.420
I think of him in these glorious times.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.540
To Grand-Guy.

55:02.410 --> 55:03.660
Marc!

55:05.830 --> 55:06.580
What's up?

55:08.250 --> 55:10.170
I need some air. Go back.

55:12.700 --> 55:13.910
What?

55:15.580 --> 55:16.750
Nothing.

55:21.830 --> 55:23.880
1998

55:35.120 --> 55:37.780
Coming through!

55:42.040 --> 55:45.040
What? What's wrong?

55:49.250 --> 55:51.250
Come on, you blues!

55:52.750 --> 55:58.330
Silence! The Marseillaise
is starting! Stand up!

56:01.910 --> 56:03.490
Marco!

56:37.250 --> 56:39.750
Have a drink.
Today's a special day.

56:39.910 --> 56:41.200
No, thanks.

56:41.370 --> 56:44.410
You'll bring us bad luck
with your crap!

56:44.790 --> 56:50.290
Folks, this round's on me. Then you pay.
You won't get free drinks all day.

56:50.450 --> 56:52.450
Unless we win!

56:54.410 --> 56:57.200
We're gonna win.
It's gonna cost you a lot!

56:57.370 --> 57:00.120
We'll give those drag queens
a kicking!

57:13.040 --> 57:15.000
Coming right up.

57:16.870 --> 57:19.370
- Marco, I don't have one.
- OK.

57:22.250 --> 57:23.830
Corner, corner!

57:36.370 --> 57:38.120
We scored!

57:42.580 --> 57:44.880
It's not over yet.

57:57.410 --> 57:59.820
I don't fuckin' believe it!

58:01.160 --> 58:05.780
We're beating Brazil
in the World Cup Final!

58:07.620 --> 58:10.200
I'll get the girls.
They have to see this.

58:24.370 --> 58:26.490
World champions!

59:03.950 --> 59:05.490
My darling...

59:06.500 --> 59:08.210
My darling!

59:09.040 --> 59:11.250
Dad's taking you to see it.

59:11.830 --> 59:17.130
A few years from now, you can say
you saw France become world champions.

59:17.290 --> 59:20.630
Just think, my darling.
World champions.

59:29.790 --> 59:31.380
Honey...

59:39.750 --> 59:42.250
Put something on.
People can see you.

59:51.200 --> 59:54.820
Did you hear?
France is winning 2-0.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.830
2-0 against Brazil.

59:57.330 --> 59:58.750
Yeah, I heard.

59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.910
An Ay-rab scores for France,
and you're happy!

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.210
France will win.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.990
France? Yeah, right!

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:10.700
Nothing but blacks and Arabs.
It's Algeria and Cameroon!

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.700
Aren't you starting a bit early?

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:23.530
OK, come on. Put on a nice dress.
I'll take you and Gwendoline.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.950
- Don't touch my daughter.
- Stop it.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:31.200
Why did you bring me here?

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:36.420
France is full of Arabs. Here, it's
blacks. I won't watch 'em on TV, too!

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.250
Please... I beg you. Not now.

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:40.820
Yes, now.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:46.700
Think of Gwendoline.
She should see it.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.030
She's a year old, asshole!
What does she care?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.070
- Stop drink...
- Don't touch me!

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.120
- Give me that glass.
- No.

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.670
Don't touch me!

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.740
- Fuck!
- Asshole!

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.950
Why bring me here?

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.950
You've got no balls.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:10.070
One day, I'll leave you.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.500
You'll never see your daughter again.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.530
You'll be left here
with all those niggers!

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.170
Fucking look at you!

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.790
A kid doesn't need a father like you.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.570
Better to have no father.

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:27.500
You useless shit!

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.200
Go on, say something.

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:33.660
Go on, stick up for yourself
for once. Be a man.

01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:38.250
Go on, react. Hit me. Go on.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.620
- Hit me!
- Stop it, dammit!

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:47.710
If you ever hit me, you'll never see
your daughter again! You hear me?

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:52.700
Yeah, get lost, asshole!

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.030
Marvin said you were back.

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:20.070
So, you have a daughter?

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:22.910
When did you last see her?

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.620
5 years ago.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.950
5 years is good.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.670
It's good.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.290
That nigger had 5 kids.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.040
I didn't mean to kill the fucker.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.570
You know that?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.950
Why didn't you tell 'em?

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.320
I did tell them.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.990
I didn't think the jerk would die.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.990
Why didn't you tell 'em
it was a joke?

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.950
It was just a joke.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.660
Because it wasn't funny.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.620
Calm down.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:12.200
Deep breaths.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.420
So?

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:22.530
How's it going?

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:29.170
Another 3 years, they say.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.500
Maybe I should stay inside.

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:34.250
What do you think?

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.130
I don't think anything.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.820
I don't know.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.170
Some say you've changed sides.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.630
I'm on no side.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.370
Oh, yeah?

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:54.880
Wasn't the fucker who knifed you

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.460
a dirty Arab?

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.030
Yes.

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.000
What of it?

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.070
- Don't you miss it?
- What?

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.000
- It was good.
- What?

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.290
All of it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.630
When we hit 'em.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:22.670
When we beat up the Reds
and the Green Berets.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.080
Those big bastards.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.450
Do you remember?

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.620
It was a real turn-on!

01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:32.630
Wasn't it?

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.620
I don't know.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.130
No.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.000
See all the weight I've put on?

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.410
I'm like a whale!

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.250
It's 'cause of the medicine.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.330
To calm my nerves.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:08.570
It mainly calms my cock.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.570
I can't get hard.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.000
In the morning,

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:18.660
it's all limp. Not a flicker.

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.790
I can't even jerk off
to the chick on TV.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.200
You know, the weather girl?

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:32.160
Yeah, you do. That whore.

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.490
- With her whore's dress!
- Calm down.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.370
Your wife went off with a black?

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.670
I can't stay here. Didn't they tell you?

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:50.130
What?

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.450
Nothing but fags in here.
Didn't they tell you?

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.240
Nothing but Ay-rabs and fags!

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.580
That one...

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.580
He's a big fag.

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:08.740
A big motherfuckin' fag!

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.620
Calm down.

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:12.080
Please.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:16.820
He's a big motherfuckin' fag!

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.040
Calm down.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.030
It's alright.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.370
They're trying to fuck me up,
but they won't succeed.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.500
These big motherfuckin' fags!
Big motherfuckin' fags!

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.320
Get off me, you big motherfuckin' fag!

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.540
- Calm down, Guy.
- Marco!

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:37.920
Calm down. Come on.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.160
2005

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.500
Again.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.210
- Still no alcohol?
- No.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.200
- No tobacco?
- No.

01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:42.660
No crack?

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:45.029
No!

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.240
That's good. You'll live to be 100.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:59.130
You know, for your tattoos,
there are laser removal techniques now.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.580
They do a good job.
They hardly leave any marks.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.990
You told me last time, Doctor.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.670
Yes.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.290
I see it went in.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.580
It's ridiculous.
You should have them removed.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.240
You can't keep
your mistakes of youth forever.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.500
OK... See you next year, then.

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.960
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.320
'Morning.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.990
'Morning.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.240
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:50.280
Know where
the paper plates and cups are?

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.450
- Down there.
- OK, thanks.

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:17.080
- So?
- Clean bill of health.

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:20.330
We did 12 points more yesterday.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.920
That's great.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.070
But the fish counter's in trouble.
Samir looks down. 22 points less.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.780
Can you do me a favor?

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:07.160
Can I help you?

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.210
Yes, Céline sent me.
This is from the store.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.450
Is that all?

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.240
Yeah.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.070
Put it over there.

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:34.210
Thanks.

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:59.740
Hey, pal, can you help me unload?
There are 14 more to do.

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:03.290
- OK.
- Thanks.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.380
God will repay you.

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.500
- Do you come here often?
- No.

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:03.780
I don't understand.

01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:09.030
I did everything.
There shouldn't be a problem.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.910
I know you're doing your best,
but I told you already

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.460
we've done everything we could.

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:18.040
Your criminal record didn't help.

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:21.910
I know you've changed, Marc.
I understand you're upset.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.630
But the kid refuses to see you.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:30.380
Can't I even call her? Talk to her?

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.630
No, don't. You have to wait
for her to grow up.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:40.670
We'll apply again next year
and the year after. She's only little.

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:46.450
I agree, her family environment
doesn't help,

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.780
but she'll soon be a teenager.
The judge might change his mind.

01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.830
You have to be patient.

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:02.530
Thank you, ma'am. Sorry.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.200
What do I owe you?

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:08.780
Nothing. I haven't done anything.
You owe me nothing.

01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:17.670
Mom...

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.790
Mom... Come eat.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:27.080
This morning, a 30-year-old man
was released due to lack of evidence.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.040
Now, politics.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.030
After a heated conference
before the European elections,

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.530
disagreement within the Front National
seems far from over.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:42.280
The far right is divided once again.
There are no holds barred.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.420
Here is our special report.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.380
The party has decided
to turn over a new leaf.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.790
Marc!

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.160
But I haven't forgotten.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:01.320
I know where we come from,
who we are and always will be.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.620
I'm not ashamed of my convictions.
I won't hide them or pretend,

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:12.070
like many of my comrades
who've let their hair grow

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:16.570
and who now wear suits and ties
in the Central Committee.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.920
But the voters aren't fooled,
believe me.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.540
I'm not a whore,
if you'll pardon the expression.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.070
Thanks, sonny.

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:27.580
I won't sell out to become mayor.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.080
After the announcement
of Jean-Michel Cayrol's suspension,

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:34.580
he made barely veiled threats.

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:36.710
But at party headquarters,

01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:39.820
there is talk of secret alliances...

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.540
Eat up, it'll go cold.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.880
A happy Sunday with Jérémie Kisling
and his "Rendez-vous Courtois"

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.630
from his latest album.
To forget the rain,

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:27.540
what better than a laugh
with the classic "Arab Cop" sketch?

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.780
Over to Coluche...

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.030
Gwendoline, can you get your brother?

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:44.780
Who is it?

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.200
It's Marco.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.960
He's come to see you.

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:56.460
That's good. I'm pleased.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.000
He can't see.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.960
They say he's dun for.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.040
You writing again?

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.290
No.

01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:10.750
She makes as many mistakes
as a 5-year-old!

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:12.660
So I see!

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.240
Cut it out!

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.620
Screw the pair of you!
You've ruined my life for long enough!

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.450
Sure it's a good idea?

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.040
What difference does it make?

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.950
You OK?

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.120
I'm good, don't worry.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.570
Is your job going OK?

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.880
Yeah.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:31.500
That's good. I'm pleased.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:37.660
My sister offered me a job
in a bar in Grenoble.

01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:10.130
You know...

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.290
I'm not scared...

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.320
I'm not scared.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.280
Sorry, it's time to wash him.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.040
No problem.

01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:35.280
I'll be back. I'll be right outside.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.960
- I'll help you.
- What did I tell you?

01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:41.750
That's nothing. Nothing at all.

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:44.820
Take that out.
It's not allowed in the rooms.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.830
I'll be back. I'll be right outside.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.920
- Here you are.
- Careful, it's hot.

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:44.030
Hey, handsome. You OK, Pascal?

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.870
How's it going?

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:49.380
Here.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.370
Let's set this up.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:00.280
1st, 2nd, 3rd generation.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.130
We're all pork eaters!

01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:08.000
1st, 2nd, 3rd generation.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.410
We're all pork eaters!

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.620
Come here.

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:21.120
Step right up. Don't be scared.
We're not here to be provocative.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.170
No, we're here, because some of you

01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:28.000
are sleeping rough,
some of you are hungry.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.280
Well, we've made you
a delicious, nourishing meal.

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.080
That's all.

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:39.630
Everything else
that people say about us is just lies.

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:45.000
In fact, the law courts allowed us
to serve this French soup.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.030
I don't see why
or on what grounds

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.370
a nationalist group like ours
should obey

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:56.000
the rules of the Muslim
or Jewish religions.

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.170
I seem to recall

01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:04.000
that Church and State are separate.
We won't be dictated to by Islamists!

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.870
Shame on you! Go away!

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.830
Who said that?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.790
Shame on us?

01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:13.120
For feeding people who are hungry?

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.240
Do you even know what pork soup is?

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:23.450
It's what French soldiers ate
in World War I for 4 years.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.660
Pork soup is part
of this country's history.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.080
What will happen to pork farmers?

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:35.460
Do we put them in camps
or exterminate them?

01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:43.950
Turn the camera off.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.040
Red, white and blue!
France for the French!

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:57.130
Why are you here?

01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:00.790
Same as you,
I'm giving out soup.

01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:05.540
I'll be right back.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.130
How can you look
at yourself in a mirror?

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:34.790
I heard you'd sunk low...

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.920
I wouldn't have believed it.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.000
I want you lot
to take your things and go.

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:45.700
- You giving me orders?
- No.

01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:48.120
Go away. They're hungry.

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.000
How could you?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.130
How could you betray us?

01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:58.990
You belong in front of a firing squad.

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.660
I want to smash your face in!

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:03.790
Go ahead. Then go.

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:07.920
I'm asking as a friend.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.320
A friend?

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:21.000
Stop it! They can see you!

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.080
Leave him alone.

01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.410
- Pack up and go.
- But...

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.710
Take all that!

01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:28.950
Let's go.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.320
C'mon, guys, let's pack up and go!

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.490
- OK, Marc?
- Yeah.

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.700
- We'll report it to the police...
- No need.

01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:51.700
- You're bleeding.
- It's OK.

01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:54.910
It's all over, it's alright.
Thanks.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.040
Ready, gentlemen?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.210
- We're gathered here for Yvette...
- Excuse me.

01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:43.570
There's no need. No-one's here.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.740
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:18.630
Sorry I'm late, kid.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.290
It doesn't matter.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.160
I'm pleased to see you.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.950
Gentlemen...

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.450
They've come from all over France
to say no to same-sex marriage.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:58.740
340,000 people according to the police,
a million according to the organizers.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:02.740
There were families
with up to 3 generations present.

01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:06.870
I'm pleased to be demonstrating
with my grandchildren

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.790
to defend the family.

01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:11.530
Children need a mother and father.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.570
It's only natural
we're demonstrating today.

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:18.040
A family is
a mother, a father, and children.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.240
3 processions converged
on the Eiffel Tower

01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:24.870
in a light-hearted mood
with carefully considered slogans

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.540
which avoided any homophobic messages.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
We have gay friends,
we adore them,

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.450
but you need a mother and father
to make a baby.

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:38.070
The demonstration of strength
was successful

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:42.420
with the crowd's support along the way.

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:45.960
The bells are ringing,
but it's not a religious event.

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.790
A 4th procession appeared uninvited.

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:53.240
1,000 hard-line Catholics

01:31:53.410 --> 01:31:58.120
whose presence was unwelcome
were kept away.

01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:12.830
Also kept away,
right and far-right politicians

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.170
came to demonstrate,
even though not all were present.

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.280
The latest polls show

01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:43.320
that over half the French are
in favor of same-sex marriage.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:55.250
France is at war
with terrorism in Mali

01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.160
to maintain our ally's security...

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.960
