dehydrated if you get hungry.

13:03.084 --> 13:05.034
[Door creaks]

13:05.963 --> 13:08.810
Damn if it doesn't
smell the same.

13:08.813 --> 13:12.139
We're back where
it all started, my friend.

13:12.140 --> 13:16.489
We were the behavioral
science unit back then.

13:17.515 --> 13:18.666
This is awesome.

13:18.668 --> 13:20.938
They called us
the B.S. unit.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.426
We were pretty organized.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.651
All right, I think
this is it.

13:29.707 --> 13:34.410
Salem, Virginia,
Roanoke County, 1978.

13:34.412 --> 13:37.642
Gideon was the lead
on this one.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.938
You know, we got enough
material here

13:48.940 --> 13:51.434
for one hell of a book.

13:51.435 --> 13:52.938
Don't you think?

13:52.940 --> 13:53.994
Huh?

13:53.996 --> 13:55.818
I said I'm gonna
write a book someday,

13:55.820 --> 13:59.178
use all our hard work,
take the credit for myself.

13:59.179 --> 14:00.585
Make a million bucks.

14:00.587 --> 14:02.538
That's nice.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.969
What are you looking at,
anyway?

14:04.971 --> 14:07.113
Birds.

14:07.116 --> 14:09.258
There's a third murder
without motive in Salem.

14:09.259 --> 14:13.705
A serial crime.
Let's get used to saying that.

14:13.707 --> 14:15.210
Every 3 months
like clockwork.

14:15.212 --> 14:17.066
So he's seasonal
like Zodiac?

14:17.067 --> 14:18.921
Yeah, but he's not
taunting us like Zodiac.

14:18.923 --> 14:20.393
He's too obsessed
with his own thing.

14:20.395 --> 14:21.865
What's his type?

14:21.867 --> 14:23.209
20-something, brunettes.

14:23.211 --> 14:25.737
He strangles them,
then leaves them in an open grave.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.241
But here's the thing.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.969
He puts dead birds
in their hands.

14:28.971 --> 14:30.377
What kind?

14:30.379 --> 14:31.561
Small, brown.

14:31.563 --> 14:33.065
They look like every
other bird I've ever seen.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.858
But it's gotta mean
something to him.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.482
Well, you got me hooked.
Let's take a trip to Roanoke.

14:37.484 --> 14:39.274
I want to talk
to these victims' families.

14:39.275 --> 14:41.226
Maybe there's a connection
between them.

14:42.635 --> 14:44.617
Did you catch him?

14:44.619 --> 14:46.378
No. There was never
a fourth body.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.042
So he wasn't obsessed
with the seasonal killing.

14:48.044 --> 14:49.642
Maybe you forced him
into hiding.

14:49.643 --> 14:51.721
He was to fixated
to stop cold turkey.

14:51.723 --> 14:55.401
We thought maybe
he was locked up or moved away.

14:55.403 --> 14:56.777
And you never saw
that signature again?

14:56.779 --> 14:59.081
No.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.841
But Gideon must have
seen something

15:00.843 --> 15:02.601
to make him leave
Florida early

15:02.603 --> 15:05.385
and drive directly
to Roanoke.

15:05.387 --> 15:06.729
[Ring]
Go ahead, Dave.

15:06.730 --> 15:09.449
Hotch, I think this is it,
but I need to fill everyone else in.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.265
The last thing Gideon
did was to shoot a bird painting.

15:12.267 --> 15:14.505
I think he was trying
to tell us that his killer

15:14.507 --> 15:18.056
is the same one from
a case we worked on in 1978.

15:18.059 --> 15:19.433
So it was someone
he locked up.

15:19.435 --> 15:21.257
No, those murders
went unsolved.

15:21.259 --> 15:22.953
So if this wasn't about
revenge on Gideon

15:22.954 --> 15:24.712
if he didn't lock the guy up,
then what was this?

15:24.714 --> 15:27.625
Maybe he went after Gideon because
he was back on the case again.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.864
The unsub was strangling
20-something brunettes.

15:29.866 --> 15:32.937
Garcia, were there any female bodies
found in Roanoke County

15:32.939 --> 15:34.216
in the past few days?

15:34.218 --> 15:35.880
Let me check
the crystal web ball.

15:35.882 --> 15:37.096
Uh...

15:37.098 --> 15:40.105
Yes. An unidentified
woman in her 50s

15:40.107 --> 15:43.048
was found in a shallow grave
just outside of Salem.

15:43.050 --> 15:44.201
Was she strangled?

15:44.203 --> 15:46.057
That's the mystery.
There was no foul play.

15:46.059 --> 15:47.529
Was there a dead bird
in her hand?

15:47.531 --> 15:49.641
What? Eew. None of that
fowl play either.

15:49.643 --> 15:50.889
What's the significance
of the bird?

15:50.890 --> 15:53.416
Those little brown birds
were the unsub's obsession.

15:53.418 --> 15:57.736
[Birds cooing and squawking]

16:27.625 --> 16:29.832
Kate: So how did Gideon
get back on the case?

16:29.834 --> 16:31.752
He saw the story
in a national paper

16:31.754 --> 16:33.256
and it obviously
piqued his interest.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.792
What are the chances
that the same woods

16:34.794 --> 16:36.392
and the same ritual
make headlines again?

16:36.394 --> 16:38.024
But the signature
was missing.

16:38.026 --> 16:39.560
That's why he drove
to Roanoke.

16:39.562 --> 16:41.736
He needed to make sure it wasn't
just a coincidence.

16:41.738 --> 16:42.825
Well, clearly it wasn't.

16:42.826 --> 16:45.192
And this woman would have
been in her 20s back then.

16:45.194 --> 16:46.568
Age-wise, that's his type.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.039
Gideon must have thought
the same thing.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.727
If she was a victim, then she was held
captive for 37 years.

16:50.730 --> 16:52.169
Who knows what he did
to her in all that time?

16:52.170 --> 16:53.991
What if he stopped killing
because he found the victim

16:53.993 --> 16:56.104
he really wanted
and held on to her?

16:56.106 --> 16:57.991
Her recent death could
have sent the unsub into a tailspin.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.392
He's probably gonna
want to find someone new.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.248
And if it's anything
like what he did before,

17:02.250 --> 17:04.424
he may hunt and kill
until he finds the right one.

17:04.425 --> 17:06.472
We'll meet you
in Roanoke, Dave.

17:08.551 --> 17:10.439
You need to stay here
with Garcia.

17:10.442 --> 17:11.560
I know.

17:11.561 --> 17:12.679
Ok.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.759
Hotch: We need to
retrace Gideon's steps.

17:30.761 --> 17:32.647
We know he arrived too late
to see the body,

17:32.649 --> 17:34.344
which is probably why
he stayed overnight.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.296
Maybe he looked at
the disposal site first

17:36.297 --> 17:37.703
and went to the M.E.
in the morning.

17:37.705 --> 17:39.239
Would he have gone
to the sheriff?

17:39.241 --> 17:41.415
Probably not, without
evidence to back up his theory.

17:41.417 --> 17:44.359
Oh. The Roanoke sheriff
just sent me the report

17:44.361 --> 17:45.895
and a crime scene photo.

17:45.897 --> 17:48.775
Gideon didn't have this photo,
but he still had a hell of a hunch.

17:48.777 --> 17:49.959
Wait a minute.

17:49.961 --> 17:51.304
Gideon had a picture.

17:51.306 --> 17:54.472
Search through his wallet.
There's a picture of a girl.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.967
Sir, he has a lot
of pictures in here.

17:56.969 --> 17:58.503
Well, look at one of
the older ones,

17:58.505 --> 18:01.063
like it was from
a high school yearbook.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.703
Tara Burnett, Roanoke High,
class of '76.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.016
That's her.

18:07.017 --> 18:10.406
It's gotta be. We met
her mother back then.

18:13.288 --> 18:14.888
How long has Tara
been missing?

18:14.889 --> 18:15.847
3 days.

18:15.849 --> 18:17.607
You told the sheriff?

18:17.609 --> 18:20.198
He doesn't believe
anyone kidnapped Tara.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.222
Why is that?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.047
She isn't much
of a looker.

18:23.049 --> 18:25.895
Like they think
no one would want her.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.223
But you know this crazy man
isn't taking the pretty ones.

18:29.225 --> 18:30.631
When you told the sheriff
your concerns,

18:30.633 --> 18:32.743
did he report Tara missing
to other jurisdictions?

18:32.745 --> 18:36.551
No. He told me
to make a flyer.

18:36.553 --> 18:38.503
That's it? Why?

18:38.505 --> 18:41.031
Because Tara ran away
when she was in high school,

18:41.033 --> 18:43.559
a few times.
She wasn't a bad kid.

18:43.561 --> 18:46.599
It's just...

18:46.601 --> 18:48.934
Her father's a real...

18:50.151 --> 18:52.103
And sometimes the cops
have come.

18:52.105 --> 18:54.919
So they think
she's run off again.

18:54.921 --> 18:57.575
But...

18:57.576 --> 19:01.607
Look, I might not be
the best mother,

19:01.609 --> 19:03.623
but I love her.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.566
And in my gut...

19:06.568 --> 19:08.742

really wrong.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.014
but they don't believe me.

You have to convince them to
file the proper paperwork.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.462

No one is listening to me.

just--can you please...

19:23.495 --> 19:27.078

thinking about Tara.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.453

19:56.455 --> 20:00.230
He still had Tara's
picture, you know.

20:00.232 --> 20:01.542
I know.

20:01.544 --> 20:03.590
He was a good man.

20:03.592 --> 20:06.086
What did you and Agent
Gideon talk about?

20:06.088 --> 20:09.926
He wanted to know if she had a butterfly
tattoo on her ankle.

20:09.928 --> 20:11.014
Did she have
that tattoo?

20:11.016 --> 20:12.422
Yes.

20:12.423 --> 20:15.174
And now you're
wanting to know, too.

20:15.176 --> 20:17.702
So what's going on?

20:18.791 --> 20:20.038
That ink's pretty faded.

20:20.039 --> 20:22.117
She must have got that
40 years ago.

20:22.119 --> 20:23.653
What was the C.O.D.?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.614
Cancer.

20:24.616 --> 20:25.574
Cancer.

20:25.576 --> 20:26.886
She was riddled with it.

20:26.888 --> 20:28.966
No evidence of tissue
damage from chemo or radiation.

20:28.968 --> 20:30.982
At first I thought her
severe muscle atrophy

20:30.984 --> 20:33.446
and bone loss
was a side effect of the disease.

20:33.448 --> 20:35.302
And she clearly
lost her appetite,

20:35.303 --> 20:36.742
because her stomach
shrunk to half its size.

20:36.744 --> 20:39.174
You said at first you thought
it was about the disease.

20:39.176 --> 20:40.326
What changed your mind?

20:40.328 --> 20:42.565
Well, I hadn't
finished the exam

20:42.567 --> 20:45.349
when I explained all of
this to the other one--what's his name?

20:45.351 --> 20:46.309
Gideon.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.781
Yes, him.

20:47.783 --> 20:49.830
Now that I've had time
to fully examine the body,

20:49.832 --> 20:51.557
it tells a different story.

20:51.559 --> 20:55.365
She's got ripped ligaments between
her pelvic girdle and femur bone,

20:55.367 --> 20:58.469
like her legs had been
dislocated multiple times.

20:58.471 --> 21:01.542
She's got calluses like she was
crawling around like a limp dog.

21:01.544 --> 21:02.982

seen that before?

Yes. On 3 young women

He took the time to bring
her all the way out here,

21:12.807 --> 21:15.492
but he didn't bury her.
It speaks to his remorse.

21:15.495 --> 21:17.573
Yeah, he probably
came here to visit.

21:17.575 --> 21:19.974
Want to bet this place has
emotional value to him?

21:19.975 --> 21:22.533
But leaving dead birds
in his victims' hands was his signature,

21:22.535 --> 21:23.813
so why abandon it now?

21:23.815 --> 21:25.413
Maybe he outgrew it?

21:25.415 --> 21:28.325
Keeping her for 40 years
became his new obsession.

21:28.327 --> 21:31.909
He's got to be comfortable here.
It takes some time to gather all this.

about getting busted.

24:54.024 --> 24:55.078
There she is.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.710
He likes that age.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.438
Hey, Hotch, there's
another missing woman.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.062
You need to get to the library
on Third and Main right now.

25:01.064 --> 25:05.798
Today's victim, Josie Behdart,
23, single, she walked to work.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.646
Local cops just found her cell phone
in a trash can and, surprise, no cameras.

25:08.648 --> 25:11.270
And all the original reports confirm
that each of the victims

25:11.272 --> 25:12.997
was taken within a mile
of this library.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.566
This guy's got a precise
comfort zone.

25:14.568 --> 25:15.878
It hasn't changed since '78.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.854
My guess is there's
another significance to this location.

25:18.855 --> 25:20.165
A library could be an ideal
hunting ground--

25:20.167 --> 25:21.893
a haven for the lonely.
Let me check it out.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.422
Gideon's plan on coming here was
to prove was to prove his hunch,

25:24.424 --> 25:26.406
so he would have gathered
enough to make a clean arrest,

25:26.408 --> 25:27.782
and that's when he
would have called us in.

25:27.784 --> 25:28.838
Except he didn't
get the chance.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.534
The unsub identified
him first.

25:30.536 --> 25:31.654
Where did he spot him?

25:31.656 --> 25:32.966
The places where
the unsub was hunting.

25:32.968 --> 25:35.334
Local hangouts. Where else would
Gideon have gone?

25:40.295 --> 25:41.958
What can I get you?

25:41.960 --> 25:44.358
Did you see a white man
in here yesterday, early 60s?

25:44.359 --> 25:47.205
He was wearing a striped shirt,
khakis, sneakers.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.326
Oh, sure. Yeah.

25:48.328 --> 25:49.894
I usually only
get regulars here,

25:49.896 --> 25:51.590
so it's easy
to remember him.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.861
He messed with
his hands a lot.

25:53.863 --> 25:55.877
I took his order,
and he sat at this booth

25:55.879 --> 25:58.213
breakfast to supper.
I gave him an extra piece of pie,

25:58.215 --> 25:59.429
he was here so long.

25:59.431 --> 26:01.349
Speaking of which,
let me get you gentlemen a slice.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.501
Uh, just coffee,
please.

26:02.503 --> 26:03.621
Sure.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.109
He knew this guy
was a local

26:07.111 --> 26:10.309
and creature of habit,
and this place screams both.

26:10.312 --> 26:12.454
Gideon stood out
because he's neither.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.757
That's how the unsub
knew who he was.

26:14.759 --> 26:16.198
And you know
he did something to make sure

26:16.199 --> 26:17.637
he got the unsub's
attention.

26:28.934 --> 26:31.333
I'm gonna do that to you.

26:31.335 --> 26:35.206
It takes a long time.

26:35.207 --> 26:37.413
[Gasps, sobs]

26:40.390 --> 26:42.789
The librarian remembers Gideon.
He got a temporary card,

26:42.791 --> 26:44.198
checked out these books
in the morning

26:44.199 --> 26:46.309
and left them in the drop box
on his drive home last night.

26:46.311 --> 26:48.133
He left the library
and came here to read books.

26:48.135 --> 26:49.797
It's classic Gideon
and classic profiling.

26:49.799 --> 26:51.684
He sat right here to let the unsub
know he was watching.

26:51.687 --> 26:52.709
And it worked.

26:52.711 --> 26:55.141
If Gideon was so sure
he lured the right guy,

26:55.143 --> 26:56.101
why didn't he tell us?

26:56.103 --> 26:57.701
It's like the unsub
was his white whale.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.269
He wanted to catch him
on his own,

26:59.271 --> 27:01.062
and his last move
was when the unsub targeted him.

27:01.063 --> 27:03.748
The age of the victims has stayed
the same as the unsub has aged.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.156
It speaks to his
arrested development.

27:05.158 --> 27:07.236
So the question's
what it's always been.

27:07.238 --> 27:08.804
Why them? Why now?

27:13.510 --> 27:15.781
And why now?

27:15.783 --> 27:17.509
Why them? Why now?

27:17.511 --> 27:20.837
It's called twitching
in England.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.597
Bird-watching.

27:22.598 --> 27:24.004
I understand
the appeal of it.

27:24.006 --> 27:25.253
It's like hunting.

27:25.255 --> 27:26.245
You hate hunting.

27:26.247 --> 27:27.589
I hate it so much.

27:27.590 --> 27:30.084
But bird-watching.
It's kind of like what we do.

27:30.087 --> 27:31.717
Everyone's got a name
and a lineage.

27:31.719 --> 27:35.749
But it's the behavior
that really distinguishes them.

27:35.751 --> 27:37.189
Like this one here.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.268
It builds courtship nests
in evergreen hemlock trees.

27:39.270 --> 27:41.061
A blue-headed vireo.

27:41.063 --> 27:42.501
Is there a quiz later?

27:42.502 --> 27:44.868
And this one here.

27:44.870 --> 27:48.196
A madly in love,
overworked Italian,

27:48.198 --> 27:49.924
who stops at every pay phone
to call his wife

27:49.926 --> 27:52.388
and buys an incredible
amount of postcards.

27:52.390 --> 27:53.700
It's a David Rossi.

27:53.702 --> 27:55.236
Not what you think.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.900
See, you're collecting
the kind of postcards you would collect

27:56.902 --> 27:58.052
if you had a kid.

27:58.054 --> 27:59.684
But you don't have a kid,

27:59.686 --> 28:01.604
which means...

28:01.606 --> 28:04.803
You and Carolyn
are expecting.

28:04.806 --> 28:06.724
Mazel.
We are.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.165
And according to my
mother and her old-world

28:08.166 --> 28:10.532
hang the needle and thread
over the belly trick,

28:10.534 --> 28:12.548
it's a boy.

28:12.550 --> 28:16.100
It's never been more important
to catch a guy like this.

28:16.102 --> 28:18.532
Everyone is someone's baby.

28:18.534 --> 28:19.780
Exactly.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.371
So, this book of yours,

28:22.373 --> 28:23.780
what does it say about
the kinds of birds

28:23.782 --> 28:25.028
he's leaving
in the victims' hands?

28:25.030 --> 28:26.084
Nelson's sparrow.

28:26.086 --> 28:28.036
You see, they're
secretive in nature.

28:28.038 --> 28:29.668
And get this.

28:29.670 --> 28:32.260
They don't listen to their own instincts
when they're in danger.

28:32.262 --> 28:34.980
Instead of flying off,
they scurry away by foot.

28:34.982 --> 28:37.924
These victims,
their self-esteem is so low,

28:37.926 --> 28:40.003
they ignore their own instinct
to fight or flight.

28:40.005 --> 28:42.147
So they wouldn't trust their gut enough
to scream or run away

28:42.150 --> 28:43.556
when danger's
smack in front of them.

28:43.558 --> 28:46.820
The person has to have
enough self-worth to want to cause a scene.

28:46.821 --> 28:48.227
Here you go.

28:48.229 --> 28:50.051
And this unknown
subject,

28:50.053 --> 28:52.643
he wants to claim
his kill.

28:52.646 --> 28:54.756
Yeah.

28:54.757 --> 28:56.131
He makes it unique
to him.

28:56.134 --> 28:59.236
The bird in the hand
is like...

29:02.245 --> 29:04.132
A signature.

29:04.134 --> 29:05.603
A signature. Yeah.

29:05.605 --> 29:07.716
I like that.
We should call it that.

29:07.718 --> 29:10.852
This is it.
Nelson's sparrow.

29:10.854 --> 29:12.196
It's what the unsub
left in their hands

29:12.198 --> 29:15.684
because its behavior
matched that of the insecure victims.

29:15.686 --> 29:17.988
So the unsub really knew his birds
and where to find them.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.227
Is there some kind of bird
lovers club in the area?

29:20.229 --> 29:23.523
Garcia, are there any nature centers
or bird-watching chapters in the area?

29:23.526 --> 29:26.020
There's an old-timey bird-watching
group called the Flappers,

29:26.021 --> 29:27.939
median age of like 89.

29:27.941 --> 29:30.147
They started
in the sixties.

29:30.149 --> 29:31.908
Most of the members
have gone extinct.

29:31.910 --> 29:34.116
And chances are
the unsub and his victims

29:34.117 --> 29:35.107
weren't a part
of that group,

29:35.109 --> 29:36.675
so where else
would he meet them?

29:36.677 --> 29:37.731
Tara was his ideal.

29:37.733 --> 29:39.332
Kate: What makes her
so special?

29:39.334 --> 29:41.155
Tara's mother said
she was broken.

29:41.157 --> 29:43.651
And he knew that because he spent
more time  watching her than the others.

29:43.653 --> 29:46.499
So he was able to study her, not just
glance as she passed by the window.

29:46.501 --> 29:48.099
She was a few years out of high school
when she disappeared.

29:48.101 --> 29:49.315
Maybe he knew her
from there.

29:49.317 --> 29:50.563
She wasn't very social.

29:50.565 --> 29:51.619
Well, neither was he.

29:51.621 --> 29:53.507
They were both in their 20s
when she was taken.

29:53.509 --> 29:55.619
If they weren't friends in high school,
maybe they worked together?

29:55.621 --> 29:58.020
Tara's mom said right out of school
she bagged groceries.

29:58.021 --> 30:01.410
I've got Tara working at Joe's on Main
summer of '76 through '77.

30:01.413 --> 30:02.947
Are there any employees
at Joe's supermarket

30:02.949 --> 30:04.579
who started in the seventies
and are still there?

30:04.581 --> 30:07.170
Well, that's nearly 40 years ago
in a galaxy far, far away

30:07.173 --> 30:08.579
that wasn't using
my magic binary boxes,

30:08.580 --> 30:10.371
but, yeah, the place
is still family owned and operated.

was her nephew

who inherited her farm

30:54.244 --> 30:56.226

in that house were his stressor.

36:14.345 --> 36:16.455
He's gonna do terrible things
and we won't find him,

36:16.456 --> 36:18.598
because there's so many of them and
there's only 3 of us.

36:18.601 --> 36:21.190
And we can't to it all.
We can't.

36:21.192 --> 36:23.526
Look at this.

36:23.528 --> 36:24.870
We didn't find her.

36:24.872 --> 36:27.462
This is someone's baby,
do you get that?

36:27.464 --> 36:28.774
Of course I get that.

36:28.776 --> 36:30.022
And you're right,
we need more help.

36:30.024 --> 36:31.174
We need an army.

36:31.176 --> 36:33.318
Then let's get back
and build our army.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.710
But we aren't gonna
get it with you screaming to the Gods.

36:38.471 --> 36:39.974
Ok.

36:48.199 --> 36:50.311
You know, if this writing
thing works out,

36:50.312 --> 36:51.782
you can buy us a plane.

36:51.784 --> 36:53.926
[Chuckles]

36:53.928 --> 36:55.526
Oh, sure. Yeah.

36:55.528 --> 36:58.566
I can see it now.

36:58.568 --> 37:02.535
You know, you've been
pretty edgy.

37:02.536 --> 37:04.294
What's really going on?

37:04.296 --> 37:06.566
You tell me, profiler.

37:06.568 --> 37:08.134
I like that.

37:08.136 --> 37:09.702
Profiler.

37:09.704 --> 37:14.726
So go ahead, tell me
why I'm so edgy lately.

37:14.728 --> 37:16.422
It's simple, really.

37:16.423 --> 37:19.334
It takes one to know one.

37:22.182 --> 37:23.813
You're gonna be
a father, too.

37:26.790 --> 37:27.909
You're very good.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.413
Not as good as me,

37:29.415 --> 37:32.389
but impressive, Agent.

37:37.479 --> 37:38.822
What's your middle name.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.966
Stephen. Why?

as he knew you would be.

38:21.063 --> 38:23.396
Thank you.

38:23.399 --> 38:25.573
He always said
you were his family.

38:25.575 --> 38:27.941
I get it.

38:27.943 --> 38:29.797
If you need anything,

39:16.902 --> 39:20.389
He loved watching
the seasons change from here.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.980
Couldn't wait
to get snowed in.

39:22.982 --> 39:25.956
So about 10 years ago,

39:25.958 --> 39:27.813
we're sitting on the runway
in Denver,

39:27.815 --> 39:30.309
and we're waiting for
the wings to be de-iced,

39:30.310 --> 39:32.357
and everybody's stressed out,

39:32.359 --> 39:34.213
and suddenly Gideon collapses

39:34.214 --> 39:37.604
in this fit of
uncontrollable laughter.

39:37.606 --> 39:39.396
You know, the crazy kind
where he ends up in tears.

39:39.398 --> 39:40.453
I know the one.

39:40.455 --> 39:42.725
And he says
that it reminds him

39:42.727 --> 39:44.837
of a case that you two
worked in a blizzard

39:44.839 --> 39:48.229
in upstate New York, and there were
no cars, so you had to take sleds.

39:48.231 --> 39:51.205
Lockport. The only time
it isn't snowing is on the fourth of July.

39:51.207 --> 39:52.805
So he says
that there was a dare...

39:52.806 --> 39:55.076
A double dare,
to take a sled

39:55.078 --> 39:57.764
down rattlesnake hill.

39:57.766 --> 40:00.549
There was the local kid.
Must have been 12.

40:00.550 --> 40:04.451
He dares us to go down
this incline that was legendary.

40:04.454 --> 40:07.332
Well, you know Gideon.
He's not about to turn down a challenge.

40:07.334 --> 40:08.612
Even from a 12-year-old.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.660
Of course. So he takes
this kid's sled

40:10.662 --> 40:13.156
and goes flying
down this hill.

40:13.158 --> 40:15.908
I mean, it was
like lightning.

40:15.909 --> 40:20.451
He jumps off right before
it smacks into a headstone.

40:20.453 --> 40:23.235
He said that was you.

40:23.238 --> 40:24.548
No.

40:24.549 --> 40:26.468
[Laughing]

40:26.469 --> 40:30.851
Yeah, well, he never let
the truth get in the way of a good story.

40:30.853 --> 40:33.316
Nope, he sure didn't.
