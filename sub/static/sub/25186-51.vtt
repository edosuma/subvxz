00:18.480 --> 00:21.799
Previously on Love Island.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.999
Relationships got back on track.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.759
<font color="#FFFF00">You make me want to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a better person.</font>

00:30.760 --> 00:32.598
<font color="#00FFFF">Give me a hug.</font>

00:32.600 --> 00:36.360
<font color="#11FF11">I would not want to be with any</font>
<font color="#11FF11">other person in here but you.</font>

00:37.960 --> 00:41.240
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you and want to be with you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I love you, too.</font>

00:51.760 --> 01:01.240
Tonight... the babies are back...

01:10.080 --> 01:14.479
..and two islanders must go.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.119
<font color="#FFFF00">The couple with the fewest votes</font>

01:16.120 --> 01:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">will be dumped from the island</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">tonight.</font>

01:40.480 --> 01:44.399
OK, boys and girls. Are we sitting
comfortably? Good. So I will begin.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.839
When a man and a woman love each
other,

01:46.840 --> 01:49.279
they sometimes share special cuddles.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.199
Special cuddles make you happy and
make you feel tummy tickles.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.679
And, nine months later,

01:54.680 --> 01:57.639
they make you wonder what the hell
you were thinking.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.160
# ARCTIC MONKEYS: Baby I'm Yours

02:04.520 --> 02:06.320
(BABIES CRY)

02:10.120 --> 02:14.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Please tell me I am still asleep.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">This must be a nightmare.</font>

02:14.760 --> 02:18.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Screaming babies, that is not ideal.</font>

02:18.600 --> 02:20.679
<font color="#00FFFF">I can hear babies.</font>

02:20.680 --> 02:24.039
<font color="#11FF11">I can hear some crying.</font>

02:24.040 --> 02:28.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Babies. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yay!</font>

02:28.520 --> 02:38.680
<font color="#11FF11">I can't wait, I can't wait.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I love kids. I love kids.</font>

02:46.800 --> 02:49.239
<font color="#11FF11">Jack Jr! Jack Jr!</font>

02:49.240 --> 02:55.279
They need to feed it, change its
nappies, look into good schools and

02:55.280 --> 02:57.999
bang on about it being on its iPhone
too much.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.640
Sorry, that is a bit later.
<font color="#11FF11">I love kids.</font>

03:02.800 --> 03:05.519
<font color="#11FF11">I love the fact there are loads of</font>
<font color="#11FF11">babies around.</font>

03:05.520 --> 03:09.279
<font color="#11FF11">They are crying a lot. They need to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">be changed, fed.</font>

03:09.280 --> 03:11.199
<font color="#11FF11">That is what it is all about.</font>

03:11.200 --> 03:14.600
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's go and see our baby!</font>

03:17.000 --> 03:21.040
<font color="#00FFFF">Excited to look after a crying,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stinking baby.</font>

03:24.200 --> 03:27.440
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God! A cot!</font>

03:33.520 --> 03:35.559
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

03:35.560 --> 03:38.679
<font color="#11FF11">I have always been broody, but I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">cannot have babies yet.</font>

03:38.680 --> 03:40.680
<font color="#11FF11">I need to wait at least three years.</font>

03:46.240 --> 03:48.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I cannot believe how excited Jack</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and Wes are.</font>

03:48.560 --> 03:51.079
<font color="#FFFF00">They sprinted out there.</font>

03:51.080 --> 03:54.680
<font color="#00FFFF">This is your baby.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That is your baby.</font>

03:59.640 --> 04:02.559
<font color="#11FF11">Mine is quite weird-looking.</font>

04:02.560 --> 04:05.919
<font color="#FFFF00">We have a girl.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">A girl? Brilliant.</font>

04:05.920 --> 04:08.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm still trying to work out,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as a man</font>

04:08.240 --> 04:11.840
<font color="#00FFFF">of science, how, without any</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">portions, I have a baby.</font>

04:13.040 --> 04:14.920
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like such a twat.</font>

04:17.959 --> 04:25.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God. Why are you holding it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Is it a girl?</font>

04:25.120 --> 04:28.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Yours is prettier.</font>

04:28.280 --> 04:32.400
<font color="#00FFFF">Josh's is crying.</font>

04:37.240 --> 04:45.359
<font color="#00FFFF">What's wrong with your baby? </font><font color="#11FF11"> We've</font>
<font color="#11FF11">already discussed names. Arabella.</font>

04:45.360 --> 04:51.880
<font color="#11FF11">I have lived in Dubai. Arab. Bella</font>
<font color="#11FF11">means beautiful. Arabella. Get it?</font>

04:54.080 --> 05:02.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, can you shut it up? Why is it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">making that noise?</font>

05:02.920 --> 05:11.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Here we go. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Unbelievable. It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">deafening. It goes through you.</font>

05:11.200 --> 05:15.679
<font color="#FFFF00">It goes through your head. It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like somebody has got a pool cue</font>

05:15.680 --> 05:17.999
<font color="#FFFF00">and stuck it straight through</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your earholes.</font>

05:18.000 --> 05:21.880
<font color="#00FFFF">We can't keep calling her 'it'.</font>

05:24.600 --> 05:32.160
<font color="#00FFFF">The baby is called Mia.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You are so proud. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

05:35.440 --> 05:41.159
She has lovely trainers. She's the
coolest kid in here, at the moment.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.879
<font color="#FFFF00">She is the babe.</font> What is the name of
your baby? <font color="#00FFFF">Arabella.</font> Arabella.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.479
That is cute, actually. <font color="#11FF11">I know.</font>

05:48.480 --> 05:52.719
Parenthood, what are the key
features? <font color="#FFFF00">Patience.</font>

05:52.720 --> 05:58.679
Haven't got much of that.
Love, isn't it? <font color="#FFFF00">Unconditional love.</font>

05:58.680 --> 06:01.799
She's going to be a bit sensitive to
the sun. Like her father.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.880
She will need factor 50. We should
put two layers of factor 50 on her.

06:06.960 --> 06:11.319
Ella Louise George. Isn't that
lovely? Lovely, isn't it?

06:11.320 --> 06:15.919
I would like her to be a doctor.
I hope so. <font color="#FFFF00">Your brains and my tan.</font>

06:15.920 --> 06:18.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Mate, it is going to be sweltering</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in that.</font>

06:18.200 --> 06:22.039
<font color="#11FF11">I just want to take pictures of you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">guys. You are so cute.</font>

06:22.040 --> 06:29.599
Be quick. <font color="#11FF11">This is Prince Cavanagh</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Joshua Denzel.</font>

06:29.600 --> 06:35.119
A very cute baby. He is just very
loud. Like his daddy. Very noisy.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Seriously, I would love a little boy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">called Vinnie. Oh, my God, please.</font>

06:39.360 --> 06:43.839
<font color="#00FFFF">No. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Please. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No because I do not like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that. That's not fair.</font>

06:43.840 --> 06:46.359
<font color="#00FFFF">That is like me being like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to call it...</font>

06:46.360 --> 06:49.679
<font color="#FFFF00">We can't have no surfer name like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Brett or Chad.</font>

06:49.680 --> 06:58.639
<font color="#FFFF00">What would you name a surfer?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I think Reef is cool. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Reef? Why?</font>

06:58.640 --> 07:04.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Just joking. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Why? It doesn't look</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a Reef, it looks like a Vinnie.</font>

07:04.480 --> 07:13.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Vincent. Say hello to our new baby,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Aubrey Crane Fowler.</font>

07:13.160 --> 07:17.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Aubrey is going to be a surfer when</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he grows up.</font>

07:19.360 --> 07:23.199
This is going to be our life one day.
Do you know what I mean?

07:23.200 --> 07:26.439
I will be sitting here like that.
<font color="#FFFF00">Bloated.</font>

07:26.440 --> 07:28.079
What do you mean, bloated?

07:28.080 --> 07:30.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Because you will be older.</font> Do I look
bloated now?

07:30.760 --> 07:33.239
<font color="#FFFF00">You look skinny and sexy now.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">When we have a baby...</font>

07:33.240 --> 07:36.360
You think I look bloated now.
<font color="#FFFF00">Shut up, Sensitive Sally.</font>

07:38.160 --> 07:42.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Her surname would be Fincham.</font>
Her name is Kimberly Fincham.

07:42.040 --> 07:47.919
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you want her middle name</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be?</font> Flo. <font color="#FFFF00"> But we call her Kiki.</font>

07:47.920 --> 07:52.039
Do we? <font color="#FFFF00">I do.</font> Kiki? No.
Let's not call her that.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.119
<font color="#FFFF00">I am, that is her nickname.</font> I will
call her Kimi.

07:56.120 --> 08:04.919
She such a little, cute baby. She's
called Kimberly now. She's so cute.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I looked like that when I was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">little!</font>

08:09.040 --> 08:12.679
NARRATOR: It is true, Dani did look
like that when she was little.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.279
She had a birthmark on her bum that
said 'Made in Taiwan'.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.239
Luckily, there is a doctor in the
house to offer postnatal classes.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.759
<font color="#FFFF00">The baby looks beautiful. I just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to make sure that</font>

08:21.760 --> 08:26.799
<font color="#FFFF00">there are no problems. The ears and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all that. A nicely formed nose</font>

08:26.800 --> 08:31.999
<font color="#FFFF00">and mouth. Beautiful. Lovely eyes.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's have a listen to the heart.</font>

08:32.000 --> 08:35.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Hopefully, it has a heart as big as</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her dad's.</font>

08:35.679 --> 08:39.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Nice, strong beating heart. Very</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good. Feel her tummy.</font>

08:39.039 --> 08:40.879
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you looking for here?</font>

08:40.880 --> 08:43.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Making sure that everything is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">formed nicely.</font>

08:43.520 --> 08:47.119
<font color="#FFFF00">No problems with her fingers,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her toes. The pulse is nice.</font>

08:47.120 --> 08:49.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Making sure that everything is as it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">should be.</font>

08:49.760 --> 08:54.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Very pleased, very pleased.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Brilliant.</font>

08:54.080 --> 08:58.839
<font color="#00FFFF">Aubrey, all good, mate. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Good to go.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I had a very busy morning.</font>

08:58.840 --> 09:00.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Health checks to do.</font>

09:00.440 --> 09:04.359
I think that was you running away
from responsibilities a little bit.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.679
However, however, I feel like you are
coming into your own.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.639
You are doing me very proud. <font color="#FFFF00">I am the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">one holding the baby. I know.</font>

09:11.640 --> 09:15.479
<font color="#FFFF00">What a beautiful child.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What is her name?</font> Kimberly.

09:15.480 --> 09:20.319
<font color="#00FFFF">Kimberly Flo Fincham. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I do not want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you to panic.</font>

09:20.320 --> 09:23.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We just want to make sure that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything is OK.</font>

09:23.960 --> 09:25.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Any concerns that you have?</font>

09:25.600 --> 09:29.639
She has been crying a lot, hasn't
she, babe? <font color="#00FFFF">Crying a lot, yeah.</font>

09:29.640 --> 09:36.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Is this her dad?</font> This is him, yeah.
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow. The baby is lovely and healthy.</font>

09:36.040 --> 09:40.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Doing very well. Any concerns, I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here 24 hours a day, at the moment.</font>

09:40.440 --> 09:45.439
<font color="#FFFF00">24 hours a day.</font> You must be working
hard. <font color="#FFFF00">If you need me, just shout.</font>

09:45.440 --> 09:48.799
Thank you very much. <font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations.</font>
Thank you.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.079
It is lucky that we have Dr Alex
with us.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.359
We feel like, if there are ever any
issues, we can go to him. <font color="#00FFFF">Perfect.</font>

09:56.360 --> 10:00.759
Paul and Laura already want another
baby. Think of the advantages.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.479
They will learn to share
and, best of all,

10:03.480 --> 10:06.239
batteries are cheaper
when you buy them in bulk.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I think one boy, one girl, it works.</font>

10:08.000 --> 10:10.519
<font color="#FFFF00">When you have a car,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">two kids in the back.</font>

10:10.520 --> 10:13.239
<font color="#FFFF00">When you go to theme parks, one of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the kids goes</font>

10:13.240 --> 10:14.999
<font color="#FFFF00">with the mum and one with the dad.</font>

10:15.000 --> 10:18.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Everyone wants a boy first before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the daughter.</font>

10:18.160 --> 10:21.199
<font color="#FFFF00">So he can look after his sister.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, that makes sense.</font>

10:21.200 --> 10:25.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I have two older sisters and I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happy. You learn a lot about girls.</font>

10:25.400 --> 10:28.279
<font color="#00FFFF">It is good. It is good for a boy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to have, like,</font>

10:28.280 --> 10:31.599
<font color="#00FFFF">loads of sisters</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and then you treat women well.</font>

10:31.600 --> 10:36.760
<font color="#FFFF00">This is a learning curve for all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of us. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> She has blue eyes like me.</font>

10:39.120 --> 10:43.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack seems to have taken to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fatherhood quite well. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He loves it.</font>

10:43.560 --> 10:48.439
<font color="#00FFFF">He loves kids.</font> Look at him laughing!
Put a little suncream on his head.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.479
He hasn't got a hat and we don't
want him to burn, do we?

10:51.480 --> 10:57.959
A little smudge. Rub it around here.
That is it. There we go.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.639
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

11:00.640 --> 11:05.079
I really love kids. I really, really
do. <font color="#FFFF00">I really love kids, as well.</font>

11:05.080 --> 11:09.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I just do not think that motherly</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing has come through yet.</font>

11:09.040 --> 11:12.959
Honestly, I can wait to be a dad,
but I can't wait to be a dad.

11:12.960 --> 11:18.199
Laura, how are you feeling about it?
<font color="#00FFFF">Chilled, mate. Chilled.</font>

11:18.200 --> 11:21.400
<font color="#11FF11">I wonder if we can take them</font>
<font color="#11FF11">swimming?</font>

11:23.680 --> 11:25.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I think everybody will do well.</font>

11:25.800 --> 11:29.439
<font color="#00FFFF">I think the boys will surprise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">themselves.</font>

11:29.440 --> 11:33.600
<font color="#11FF11">I think most dads do surprise</font>
<font color="#11FF11">themselves.</font>

11:34.920 --> 11:36.959
(LAUGHTER)

11:36.960 --> 11:40.359
<font color="#00FFFF">What did you do? Did you hit it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on the head?</font>

11:40.360 --> 11:42.160
I need to check something.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.679
I need to check something.
Who thinks they have a boy?

11:47.680 --> 11:50.679
<font color="#FFFF00">I had a boy and he has a willy.</font>

11:50.680 --> 11:55.479
<font color="#00FFFF">That is why it is crying,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">got the wrong clothes on.</font>

11:55.480 --> 11:59.559
Who has a boy? Does it have a willy?
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it has a willy.</font>

11:59.560 --> 12:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The girls have nothing, Jack.</font> I have
a girl! <font color="#00FFFF">You thought you had a boy?</font>

12:04.960 --> 12:06.479
I've got a girl.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.519
Dr Alex unfortunately forgot to check
the sex of the baby.

12:12.520 --> 12:18.159
Therefore, we were going along the
lines of a boy. It was a girl.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.039
I have paid for private healthcare
and for what?

12:23.040 --> 12:29.079
For him to give me a wrong
diagnostic? Diagnosis? Diagnosis.

12:29.080 --> 12:36.199
(CRYING) <font color="#FFFF00">I can't figure out if it is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yours or mine making the noise.</font>

12:36.200 --> 12:41.239
<font color="#00FFFF">Get away from my baby. Get your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">crying baby away from my baby.</font>

12:41.240 --> 12:44.759
<font color="#FFFF00">It is probably hungry. It is not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">burping. You haven't fed it.</font>

12:44.760 --> 12:46.720
<font color="#11FF11">I have just fed her. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, shit.</font>

12:52.320 --> 12:56.919
It was quite traumatic. <font color="#FFFF00">Really.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It gets louder, a lot louder.</font>

12:56.920 --> 13:03.559
<font color="#FFFF00">At first, it is like... and then...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and then... (SCREAMS)</font>

13:03.560 --> 13:12.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Bottle?</font> Oh, my God.
It is quite intense, isn't it?

13:12.240 --> 13:15.440
<font color="#00FFFF">They are like proper babies, crying</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all the time.</font>

13:21.680 --> 13:24.359
<font color="#11FF11">It is all right, babe. You stay</font>
<font color="#11FF11">there and look sexy, yeah?</font>

13:24.360 --> 13:30.680
<font color="#11FF11">You stay there, look sexy, you MILF.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I will deal with this. Yeah.</font>

13:32.200 --> 13:34.159
Why are you shaking your head?

13:34.160 --> 13:38.519
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just thinking, is this kid even</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mine?</font> Is this kid even mine?

13:38.520 --> 13:45.920
The cheek! You can see
his beautiful face. Sssh.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.360
Looks just like his dad.

13:52.600 --> 13:59.480
(CRYING)
<font color="#00FFFF">I have tried everything.</font>

14:05.560 --> 14:17.680
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, hell. I didn't do paediatrics</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for a reason. The screaming is why.</font>

14:20.320 --> 14:22.520
<font color="#00FFFF">I cannot do it!</font>
(CRYING)

14:26.760 --> 14:28.959
Jack plays the name game.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.599
<font color="#FFFF00">This is Aubrey. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Aubrey?</font>

14:31.600 --> 14:34.080
<font color="#11FF11">Audrey? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Aubrey. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> How do you not know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">your baby's name?</font>

14:42.640 --> 14:47.799
A load of whining brats are given the
task of looking after some babies.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.079
But how are they getting on?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.079
# THE RONETTES: Be My Baby

14:52.080 --> 14:54.880
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm your dad!</font>

14:56.600 --> 14:58.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Just take it off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and put it back on again.</font>

14:58.920 --> 15:01.839
<font color="#00FFFF">Why is it being such a little shit?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Calm down.</font>

15:01.840 --> 15:05.440
<font color="#11FF11">Ah, zabenya.</font>

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
Put his head over your shoulder.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Look at that fit bunch. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I love it.</font>

15:14.920 --> 15:16.920
<font color="#11FF11">You can't forget behind the ears.</font>

15:22.000 --> 15:27.639
Hello. <font color="#FFFF00">Hi, girlies. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> How do I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a headache already?</font>

15:27.640 --> 15:30.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I have not had one headache</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">since I have been here.</font>

15:30.160 --> 15:32.519
<font color="#00FFFF">A baby comes along,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I have a booming headache.</font>

15:32.520 --> 15:35.239
<font color="#11FF11">It is crying so loud, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Screams.</font>

15:35.240 --> 15:37.639
<font color="#00FFFF">What is the point of screaming</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">so loud?</font>

15:37.640 --> 15:40.159
Some babies do just cry a lot,
don't they?

15:40.160 --> 15:41.879
<font color="#00FFFF">Keep the babies as far away from me</font>

15:41.880 --> 15:44.199
<font color="#00FFFF">as possible, especially when they</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are crying.</font>

15:44.200 --> 15:47.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I think they will make good mums,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">some of them. It is what dads do.</font>

15:47.840 --> 15:49.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Sit there and and go, what a great</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mum she is!</font>

15:50.000 --> 15:51.559
<font color="#11FF11">That is actually what makes a dad.</font>

15:51.560 --> 15:54.519
<font color="#11FF11">You just go, she ain't half that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">good with the baby.</font>

15:54.520 --> 15:59.719
<font color="#FFFF00">You just hype your mum up.</font>

15:59.720 --> 16:03.679
Jack loves it. He said, I love kids.
I cannot wait to have kids.

16:03.680 --> 16:15.159
I was like, ooh. <font color="#FFFF00">I think me and you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">need to swap. Alex is like, no, no.</font>

16:15.160 --> 16:19.079
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes hasn't even eaten, drank</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nothing. He has been on it.</font>

16:19.080 --> 16:23.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Is anybody actually broody, though?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am so broody.</font>

16:23.560 --> 16:26.440
<font color="#00FFFF">It is when it does that scream.</font>

16:28.080 --> 16:31.439
I would like to have children, but I
think I would wait a few years.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I am 100% having kids. I can't wait</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to have kids. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I want to be like 30.</font>

16:35.080 --> 16:37.199
<font color="#11FF11">You say that but even when</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you are 30,</font>

16:37.200 --> 16:40.519
<font color="#11FF11">you will probably say you are not</font>
<font color="#11FF11">ready.</font> When are you gonna be ready?

16:40.520 --> 16:44.399
<font color="#FFFF00">Would you be ready? </font><font color="#11FF11"> If it were to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">happen to me now, I'd be fine.</font>

16:44.400 --> 16:48.160
<font color="#11FF11">Essentially, I would probably want</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to wait another couple of years.</font>

16:51.880 --> 16:53.919
<font color="#FFFF00">This isn't so bad.</font>

16:53.920 --> 16:57.079
Look at Wes go. If I ever have
a plastic child,

16:57.080 --> 17:00.280
I think I have found the ideal
plastic babysitter.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I honestly don't know how some of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my friends have had babies.</font>

17:08.880 --> 17:12.199
Up on the terrace, Josh is holding
the confession cushion and his

17:12.200 --> 17:15.398
confession is, he would rather be
holding a confession cushion

17:15.400 --> 17:18.118
than one of those stupid plastic
babies.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.279
<font color="#00FFFF">You have been running away. I do not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think you have held him once.</font>

17:21.280 --> 17:23.638
<font color="#FFFF00">I have held him a few times,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but he cries.</font>

17:23.640 --> 17:26.679
<font color="#00FFFF">You have been quite an absent</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">father. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, you know what?</font>

17:26.680 --> 17:30.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Absence makes the heart grow fonder.</font>
I enjoy the responsibility.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.999
<font color="#00FFFF">So, you are quite hands-on, then.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You can teach Josh a few things.</font>

17:36.000 --> 17:44.279
It is a she. <font color="#00FFFF">Audrey, yeah.</font> Aubrey.
<font color="#00FFFF">Sorry, sorry, sorry. Aubrey. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Audrey.</font>

17:44.280 --> 17:50.839
No, this is Aubrey. <font color="#00FFFF">Aubrey. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Audrey is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to surf. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Aubrey?</font> Aubrey.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.159
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you not know your baby's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">name?</font>

17:53.160 --> 17:56.359
<font color="#FFFF00">First of all, you do not know your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">baby's gender and then you do not</font>

17:56.360 --> 17:59.359
<font color="#FFFF00">know your baby's name and you are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">telling me you are hands-on!</font>

17:59.360 --> 18:01.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Good dangling a toy in front</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of its face. He? She?</font>

18:01.800 --> 18:03.439
Her name is Aubrey.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.079
<font color="#00FFFF">New Jack has really surprised me.</font>

18:06.080 --> 18:09.719
<font color="#00FFFF">He seems like this kind of player</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">type and very immature.</font>

18:09.720 --> 18:13.239
<font color="#00FFFF">But, as soon as he became a dad,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he has completely changed.</font>

18:13.240 --> 18:16.279
<font color="#00FFFF">It is nice to see that support</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from him.</font>

18:16.280 --> 18:21.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I guess some people just take to it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">better than others.</font> (CRYING)

18:21.520 --> 18:23.879
<font color="#00FFFF">Rock him.</font>

18:23.880 --> 18:35.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Why is he screaming more now?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I do not know how people do it.</font>

18:35.720 --> 18:38.200
<font color="#FFFF00">It has been half a day</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I am a broken man.</font>

18:40.800 --> 18:45.079
Look at these two. No-one is going to
mess with their kid at school.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.519
'My dad is harder than your dad!'

18:47.520 --> 18:50.279
'My grandad is Danny Dyer. End of.'

18:50.280 --> 18:52.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I think we are going to be really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good parents.</font>

18:52.400 --> 18:57.239
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I hope so. It is scary. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">scary, it is scary.</font>

18:57.240 --> 19:02.239
<font color="#FFFF00">The thought of, you have two people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to look after.</font>

19:02.240 --> 19:04.519
<font color="#FFFF00">I will be better at day shifts,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I reckon.</font>

19:04.520 --> 19:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought you wouldn't mind getting</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up in the night. Can we compromise?</font>

19:11.960 --> 19:15.799
<font color="#FFFF00">The thing is, though. If I have been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up four times in the night, right,</font>

19:15.800 --> 19:18.879
<font color="#FFFF00">feeding the baby, I then have to go</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to work, the breadwinner.</font>

19:18.880 --> 19:25.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to work. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I have to get up.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I need to earn...</font>

19:25.160 --> 19:27.799
<font color="#FFFF00">As a man, I need to pay the mortgage</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and that.</font>

19:27.800 --> 19:34.679
<font color="#FFFF00">How am I going to do that?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I do want to work.</font>

19:34.680 --> 19:37.399
<font color="#00FFFF">We cannot live in a world where only</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one person works.</font>

19:37.400 --> 19:39.439
<font color="#00FFFF">It is not like that. It is too</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">expensive.</font>

19:39.440 --> 19:41.879
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got quite traditional views</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on parenting.</font>

19:41.880 --> 19:45.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Even though, like, it was just me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and my mum the majority of the time,</font>

19:45.640 --> 19:47.839
<font color="#FFFF00">my grandad used to always instil</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in me,</font>

19:47.840 --> 19:51.239
<font color="#FFFF00">as soon as you can work, you go to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">work. I have grown up with that.</font>

19:51.240 --> 19:56.119
<font color="#FFFF00">When I have a kid, I want to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a really fun parent.</font>

19:56.120 --> 20:03.599
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to do so much fun stuff.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I want them to be so polite.</font>

20:03.600 --> 20:08.679
<font color="#00FFFF">I want her to be able to tell me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everything. Like I am with my mum.</font>

20:08.680 --> 20:11.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I want her to be able to, whatever</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she has done,</font>

20:11.640 --> 20:13.679
<font color="#00FFFF">just be able to confide in me.</font>

20:13.680 --> 20:16.839
<font color="#00FFFF">For me to be able to always give her</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the right advice.</font>

20:16.840 --> 20:18.359
<font color="#00FFFF">It is so important.</font>

20:18.360 --> 20:21.839
<font color="#00FFFF">You need to look at your mum and dad</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as your best mates, as well.</font>

20:21.840 --> 20:24.279
<font color="#00FFFF">My mum is stricter than my dad.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Really?</font>

20:24.280 --> 20:27.719
<font color="#00FFFF">My dad is more lenient with certain</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things.</font>

20:27.720 --> 20:30.759
<font color="#00FFFF">He has always been like that, more</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lenient than my mum.</font>

20:30.760 --> 20:35.079
<font color="#00FFFF">My mum is strict. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Bless her. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">brilliant with her.</font>

20:35.080 --> 20:37.319
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like I love him more.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't believe it.</font>

20:37.320 --> 20:39.359
<font color="#00FFFF">This morning, he wasn't warming</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to her</font>

20:39.360 --> 20:42.119
<font color="#00FFFF">as much as I wanted him to and now,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he doesn't leave her alone.</font>

20:42.120 --> 20:43.799
<font color="#00FFFF">He really loves her.</font>

20:43.800 --> 20:46.919
Josh went to write some name tags for
the babies clothes

20:46.920 --> 20:48.759
and he has been gone three hours.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.959
Bet he wishes he hadn't called him
Prince Cavanagh Joshua Denzel.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.639
<font color="#FFFF00">It is Daddy. You remember we exist!</font>

20:55.640 --> 21:01.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you remember that we exist?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You remember the name of your son?</font>

21:01.520 --> 21:05.480
Hello, man. Do you remember me?
<font color="#FFFF00">Doesn't even know who you are.</font>

21:10.280 --> 21:13.280
<font color="#00FFFF">I have got a text! </font><font color="#11FF11"> A text! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> A text.</font>

21:23.240 --> 21:25.759
Why is that fair?

21:25.760 --> 21:31.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Can someone please tell me, someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">please tell me, a break from what?</font>

21:31.640 --> 21:36.839
<font color="#00FFFF">Smug as Larry!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have had this the whole time.</font>

21:36.840 --> 21:41.439
<font color="#11FF11">It is all right, a bit of Daddy</font>
<font color="#11FF11">daycare.</font> Look at your face.

21:41.440 --> 21:45.559
I do not want to leave him with him.
<font color="#FFFF00">A well-deserved break.</font>

21:45.560 --> 21:50.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been such a hard-working mum!</font>

21:51.880 --> 22:00.559
I have put heart, soul into baby Mia.
I have spent twice as much time

22:00.560 --> 22:05.120
with her as Megan has.
They have been rewarded.

22:07.320 --> 22:13.679
<font color="#FFFF00">I love her. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I think it will be good</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for the boys. They need a bit of</font>

22:13.680 --> 22:15.239
<font color="#00FFFF">alone time with the babies.</font>

22:15.240 --> 22:23.359
<font color="#FFFF00">The DBS society has become the Daddy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Daycare Society. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I am not the</font>

22:23.360 --> 22:34.879
<font color="#11FF11">stay-at-home dad type.</font> Today, you
are. <font color="#FFFF00">I got this. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You lot look</font>

22:34.880 --> 22:44.399
<font color="#00FFFF">fabulous. Honestly. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Goodbye, guys!</font>
Mate, I miss them already. Hey,

22:44.400 --> 22:51.560
little man. <font color="#FFFF00">Girls, are you excited?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">MILFS on tour!</font>

22:56.120 --> 22:58.120
Alex comes a cropper.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.759
Here is your chance to get your own
taste of the Love Island lifestyle,

23:06.760 --> 23:10.959
with a massive £20,000 in tax-free
cash and an unforgettable seven

23:10.960 --> 23:17.439
night holiday in magical Majorca.
You and five mates will stay at this

23:17.440 --> 23:22.759
stunning five-star hotel. Nice! You
will not even have to touch that

23:22.760 --> 23:26.359
£20,000 prize money because breakfast
and dinner are included

23:26.360 --> 23:31.519
and we are chucking in E500 spending
money per person. Actually, I think

23:31.520 --> 23:34.040
I am free that week!
For your chance to win...

24:07.280 --> 24:11.399
Ladies and gentlemen. Love Island is
proud to present a question where

24:11.400 --> 24:15.879
the correct answer is, 'I have
delivered a few vaginal ones.'

24:15.880 --> 24:29.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Most of the ones I have done are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">C-sections. It is amazing.</font>

24:29.920 --> 24:33.519
<font color="#FFFF00">At that moment, by your actions, you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">were there when the baby</font>

24:33.520 --> 24:44.559
<font color="#FFFF00">came into the world.</font> What is a
C-section? <font color="#FFFF00">You make your incision</font>

24:44.560 --> 24:49.159
<font color="#FFFF00">based on where the baby is. You will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make a cut along the lower line of</font>

24:49.160 --> 24:55.439
<font color="#FFFF00">the tummy. You go through the fat</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">layer and then you go into</font>

24:55.440 --> 25:00.639
<font color="#FFFF00">the muscular layer. That is before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you get to where the womb will be.</font>

25:00.640 --> 25:04.119
<font color="#FFFF00">The uterus, basically.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You have to tear.</font>

25:04.120 --> 25:13.039
<font color="#FFFF00">You do not want to cut muscle. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to tear it. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am so glad that</font>

25:13.040 --> 25:17.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm a male. I have a lot of respect.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, I cannot commend women</font>

25:17.640 --> 25:23.079
<font color="#00FFFF">enough. The struggles they go</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">through. That sounds horrific.</font>

25:23.080 --> 25:29.639
<font color="#FFFF00">You make a cut along the uterus.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Unfortunately you have to tear that.</font>

25:29.640 --> 25:39.039
<font color="#FFFF00">You pull it apart until you open</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that. Fairly strong.</font>

25:39.040 --> 25:40.599
<font color="#FFFF00">You properly pull.</font>

25:40.600 --> 25:45.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Then you get to the sac which the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">baby sits in. As soon as you pop</font>

25:45.840 --> 25:51.679
<font color="#FFFF00">that, you stimulate the baby. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pop it and then pull that sack.</font>

25:51.680 --> 25:55.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Then you need to suction all of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fluid as it comes out. A bit of</font>

25:55.960 --> 26:01.199
<font color="#FFFF00">blood there. Hopefully, the head is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a nice position. Hand in.</font>

26:01.200 --> 26:04.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Scoop the baby out, pull it out.</font>

26:04.160 --> 26:09.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Then you give the baby to the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">midwife. Sometimes you lose litres</font>

26:09.200 --> 26:14.679
<font color="#FFFF00">of blood and there is a lot of blood</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coming out. </font><font color="#11FF11"> He has had his hands</font>

26:14.680 --> 26:23.039
<font color="#11FF11">in a person, not the other way.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have made it sound weird. He has</font>

26:23.040 --> 26:25.360
<font color="#11FF11">had his hands in people.</font>

26:26.800 --> 26:35.160
Girls, have some drinks.
Whatever it is, it is on me!

26:42.000 --> 26:51.040
<font color="#11FF11">Look at that view. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I want to dive</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Jump on one of those yachts!</font>

26:53.320 --> 27:06.359
<font color="#11FF11">Ladies, cheers. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is so nice.</font> We
deserve a nice little afternoon out.

27:06.360 --> 27:13.599
<font color="#FFFF00">It is 2018, the boy should be doing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">their bit, shouldn't they? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Jack is</font>

27:13.600 --> 27:18.559
<font color="#00FFFF">a bit of a party boy, very loud.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">As soon as you have the baby,</font>

27:18.560 --> 27:22.679
<font color="#00FFFF">he has been so kind and caring.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It is nice to see that other side</font>

27:22.680 --> 27:28.599
<font color="#11FF11">of him. He didn't want to put</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the baby down, just constantly</font>

27:28.600 --> 27:37.359
<font color="#11FF11">be around him. Make sure he is OK.</font>
I could see Alex has the fear of God

27:37.360 --> 27:47.039
in him. He was laying there with
the baby on his chest. Not really

27:47.040 --> 27:55.759
moving too much. Like it is a piece
of China. <font color="#FFFF00">The way he cuddles me,</font>

27:55.760 --> 28:02.119
<font color="#FFFF00">it is like, what is that, Alex?</font>
Tell him to do another role-play!

28:02.120 --> 28:12.039
<font color="#FFFF00">It makes you fancy them, I think. It</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is attractive to see that side. Wes</font>

28:12.040 --> 28:19.079
<font color="#FFFF00">is so natural. Oh, my God. It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so cute. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Paul is amazing. We were</font>

28:19.080 --> 28:25.879
<font color="#11FF11">talking about the names yesterday.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Going to be 32 this year. It makes</font>

28:25.880 --> 28:29.479
<font color="#11FF11">me feel a bit, I do not have to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">worry about skin. It is a weight</font>

28:29.480 --> 28:35.919
<font color="#11FF11">lifted off my shoulders. Being able</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to say exactly how I feel. He is not</font>

28:35.920 --> 28:42.119
<font color="#11FF11">running to the hills. I totally</font>
<font color="#11FF11">trust him. I think he was like, yes,</font>

28:42.120 --> 28:47.759
<font color="#11FF11">you can go. I do not need you.</font> I do
not feel the same as any of you. I

28:47.760 --> 28:56.039
have been looking after the baby all
day. There is no father bond there!

28:56.040 --> 29:04.159
Maybe some time alone with him and
Prince, he might seem inseparable

29:04.160 --> 29:09.559
with his son. <font color="#FFFF00">I reckon they are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">trying to take it seriously but I</font>

29:09.560 --> 29:12.599
<font color="#FFFF00">do not think they are,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have to be honest.</font>

29:12.600 --> 29:24.239
Back in the villa, Alec spent 30
minutes describing a colonoscopy.

29:24.240 --> 29:39.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Daddy yoga.</font> (CRYING)
<font color="#00FFFF">That will stop straight after.</font>

29:39.240 --> 29:47.799
<font color="#00FFFF">It is called the Simba.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You are amazing!</font>

29:47.800 --> 30:01.559
<font color="#00FFFF">You are going to be great! I love</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you! </font><font color="#11FF11"> Every baby started crying.</font>

30:01.560 --> 30:05.719
<font color="#11FF11">One baby heard one baby and then</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that one cried. Some people are just</font>

30:05.720 --> 30:12.640
<font color="#11FF11">not cut out to be fathers just yet.</font>
He is flying.

30:19.200 --> 30:28.520
Paul first. Three, two...

30:39.200 --> 30:45.200
My poor baby!
<font color="#11FF11">(CRIES)</font>

30:50.480 --> 30:54.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls, what on earth do you think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys are getting up to?</font>

30:54.240 --> 31:05.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I am actually scared. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Do not hold my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">baby. Did you actually fall over?</font>

31:07.640 --> 31:20.359
<font color="#11FF11">My leg! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am nervous.</font>

31:20.360 --> 31:24.119
I do not want him
to have changed her.

31:24.120 --> 31:38.520
<font color="#FFFF00">Mum! Didn't see you guys there.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Still alive?</font>

31:39.600 --> 31:45.959
<font color="#11FF11">Have you had a nice time?</font> We have
loved it. She hasn't cried, nothing.

31:45.960 --> 31:56.479
She has loved it. <font color="#FFFF00">Have you had a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lovely time? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> What the hell have you</font>

31:56.480 --> 32:09.239
<font color="#00FFFF">lot been doing? </font><font color="#11FF11"> A sock there.</font> We
were walking. We went on a stroll.

32:09.240 --> 32:18.679
<font color="#00FFFF">No, Alex. What on earth has been</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going on? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Alex tripped, fell. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> When</font>

32:18.680 --> 32:23.919
<font color="#00FFFF">you leave them unattended with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">no guidance and direction, shit is</font>

32:23.920 --> 32:26.239
<font color="#00FFFF">going to hit the fan.</font>

32:26.240 --> 32:34.159
Do not write in to Ofcom. These are
plastic babies, people!

32:34.160 --> 32:42.080
<font color="#FFFF00">Look at him.</font>

32:49.600 --> 33:02.600
<font color="#00FFFF">What? </font><font color="#11FF11"> His arm has come off. His arm</font>
<font color="#11FF11">has come off! His arm has come off!</font>

33:10.480 --> 33:12.760
<font color="#11FF11">His arm has come off!</font>

33:24.320 --> 33:28.679
The babies have been fantastic.
Let's give them a big hand!

33:28.680 --> 33:32.039
Actually, Prince needs a new elbow,
as well. And arm. Actually,

33:32.040 --> 33:34.079
the whole thing needs replacing.

33:34.080 --> 33:43.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Night night. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I love you, beautiful.</font>

33:43.120 --> 33:51.879
<font color="#00FFFF">I have really bonded with Kimberly.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">She was my little Kiks. It was nice</font>

33:51.880 --> 34:06.840
<font color="#00FFFF">to have a pretend baby. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Bye, Mia.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Goodbye, Arabella. We love you.</font>

34:12.159 --> 34:18.839
It is weird because she is only
a little doll. You connect to it

34:18.840 --> 34:23.199
because you've spent the whole day
making sure she is all right. <font color="#FFFF00">It is</font>

34:23.199 --> 34:31.478
<font color="#FFFF00">really emotional.</font> It was a bit sad.
I don't want to talk about!

34:31.480 --> 34:37.119
<font color="#00FFFF">Say goodbye to your son and tell him</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that you love him. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It has been</font>

34:37.120 --> 34:44.839
<font color="#11FF11">great, mate. I thought I would never</font>
<font color="#11FF11">see him again. Internally, I was</font>

34:44.840 --> 34:50.438
<font color="#11FF11">tearing up. I was very disappointed.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I had to hold it together as</font>

34:50.440 --> 34:52.239
<font color="#11FF11">a strong father would.</font>

34:53.520 --> 34:57.559
It is time to reveal who looked after
their baby the best.

34:57.560 --> 35:02.800
Josh, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.680
<font color="#00FFFF">I got a text!</font>

35:18.960 --> 35:27.480
<font color="#00FFFF">..Jack and Laura. Dani and Jack and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Paul and Laura also passed.</font>

35:30.040 --> 35:44.200
<font color="#00FFFF">The others have all failed.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What about little Prince?</font>

35:55.760 --> 35:57.719
It is time for a dumping.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.880
<font color="#FFFF00">The couple with the fewest votes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">will be dumped from the island.</font>

36:08.720 --> 36:12.239
After the baby test, the islanders
are discussing who is ready for

36:12.240 --> 36:17.279
parenthood. Jack, you should go for
it. Josh, have you thought about

36:17.280 --> 36:22.999
a vasectomy? <font color="#FFFF00">I am not saying I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">ready for a baby. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I think you are</font>

36:23.000 --> 36:29.919
<font color="#00FFFF">ready, mate. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I feel like you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">probably did the most work. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I love</font>

36:29.920 --> 36:40.799
<font color="#FFFF00">babies, I really, really do.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You look lovely.</font>

36:40.800 --> 36:47.839
This lot are having a party.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.920
(MUSIC PLAYING)

37:02.520 --> 37:07.680
<font color="#FFFF00">I loved the party tonight. The boys</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just wanted to show their moves.</font>

37:10.840 --> 37:17.279
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you know what, I am doing dad</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">dancing after a day</font>

37:17.280 --> 37:23.559
<font color="#00FFFF">of being a parent. </font><font color="#11FF11"> The party was</font>
<font color="#11FF11">really good. Had a little dance-off.</font>

37:23.560 --> 37:29.960
<font color="#11FF11">Girls vs boys. I was dancing off</font>
<font color="#11FF11">against Dr Alex who was loving it.</font>

37:35.800 --> 37:40.599
It has been a stressful few days.
I enjoyed the party, as did

37:40.600 --> 37:42.440
everybody else. It was great.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.959
The islanders are exhausted.
Looking after babies and making

37:53.960 --> 37:57.240
a dance montage in one day?
I am not surprised.

37:59.040 --> 38:12.679
<font color="#00FFFF">Texts. You are going on a date.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That was so long ago.</font>

38:12.680 --> 38:14.719
(TEXT ALERT)

38:14.720 --> 38:16.280
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got a text!</font>

38:20.640 --> 38:25.800
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, fuck's sake.</font>

38:32.560 --> 38:36.919
You lot have been voting for your
favourite couple. Now it is time

38:36.920 --> 38:39.120
to watch those islanders sweat.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
(TEXT ALERT)

38:55.760 --> 38:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The public have been voting for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">their favourite couple. The couple</font>

38:59.960 --> 39:03.040
<font color="#FFFF00">with the fewest votes will be dumped</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from the island tonight.</font>

39:21.320 --> 39:25.440
<font color="#00FFFF">The first couple at risk is...</font>

39:39.600 --> 39:41.480
<font color="#00FFFF">..Megan and Wes.</font>

39:55.280 --> 39:57.440
<font color="#11FF11">The second couple at risk is...</font>

40:14.600 --> 40:16.600
<font color="#11FF11">..Kaz and Josh.</font>

40:39.680 --> 40:41.880
The final couple at risk is...

40:57.880 --> 41:00.160
..Laura and Jack.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.599
<font color="#FFFF00">The couple with the fewest votes</font>

41:33.600 --> 41:35.880
<font color="#FFFF00">and therefore dumped from the island</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is...</font>

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
<font color="#FFFF00">..Laura and Jack.</font>

42:15.280 --> 42:17.480
Well done, guys.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.039
<font color="#00FFFF">Everyone in here now has had a bond</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and is close.</font>

42:34.040 --> 42:44.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Seeing anybody going now is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">horrible. </font><font color="#11FF11"> No matter how it turned</font>

42:44.200 --> 42:50.799
<font color="#11FF11">out, whoever left, it was always</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to be a shit situation. Their</font>

42:50.800 --> 42:58.679
<font color="#11FF11">relationship is blossoming and it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">has grown so quickly.</font> Every single

42:58.680 --> 43:02.519
dumping that goes on now cuts a bit
deeper. You look to your left and

43:02.520 --> 43:07.759
right. Megan and Wes, Jack and Laura.
It will be gutting for me to see

43:07.760 --> 43:17.880
any of these guys go. Unfortunately,
it was their time. <font color="#FFFF00">I need a beatbox.</font>

43:22.720 --> 43:27.040
<font color="#00FFFF">We are going to miss you, bro.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Laura wants to kiss you, bro.</font>

43:31.240 --> 43:39.999
<font color="#11FF11">Anyone that goes now, it kills you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We were a big part of each other's</font>

43:40.000 --> 43:49.599
<font color="#11FF11">journey in here. We always will be.</font>
I just want to say, I am happy.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I am happy that you guys are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">amazing. I am glad you are</font>

43:53.320 --> 43:58.759
<font color="#FFFF00">leaving with her. She is the best</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl ever. She is such a sweetheart.</font>

43:58.760 --> 44:04.040
<font color="#FFFF00">Him and Laura will do so well.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He has done good.</font>

44:12.080 --> 44:16.559
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't think I would ever have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">genuine feelings for somebody. That</font>

44:16.560 --> 44:23.839
<font color="#00FFFF">is all I could ask for. To also have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">friends like you guys, too. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You get</font>

44:23.840 --> 44:32.199
<font color="#11FF11">to leave with an amazing boy.</font> Do you
know what, I am going to miss him.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.440
I got my name back, so that is
a bonus. Every cloud.

44:50.440 --> 44:53.479
<font color="#FFFF00">What an experience it has been.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Unbelievable. It has happened so</font>

44:53.480 --> 44:58.319
<font color="#FFFF00">quickly. I have walked away with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this absolute rocket. I couldn't be</font>

44:58.320 --> 45:00.040
<font color="#FFFF00">happier. Couldn't be happier.</font>

45:06.320 --> 45:10.039
<font color="#00FFFF">Being dumped from the villa, a bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of a bittersweet. Made amazing</font>

45:10.040 --> 45:13.679
