00:01.215 --> 00:02.781
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.782 --> 00:05.004
Cami: Right now, people like me
are out there getting killed

00:05.005 --> 00:07.108
by people like you,
conveniently timed

00:07.109 --> 00:09.472
with the arrival of
your old acquaintance.

00:09.473 --> 00:12.719
So you came all this way
to deliver a warning.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.611
The life of
every vampire is linked back

00:14.612 --> 00:16.579
to the original
who begat the line.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.147
Kill an original,
wipe out an entire line.

00:19.148 --> 00:21.918
If you want to know what I'd do
about the dangers you now face,

00:21.919 --> 00:24.154
there is something
that you must see.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.255
Your ancient heart
beats strong, indeed,

00:26.257 --> 00:27.891
for someone in such danger.

00:27.892 --> 00:29.659
If you have a warning
to deliver, luv,

00:29.660 --> 00:30.960
best get on with it.

00:30.961 --> 00:33.129
Freya: His prophecy
is fulfilled.

00:33.130 --> 00:35.565
You will all fall...
One by friend,

00:35.566 --> 00:38.735
one by foe, and one by family.

00:38.736 --> 00:40.837
You've acquired
countless enemies,

00:40.838 --> 00:44.114
and with the sire lines at war,
you now have mine, as well.

00:44.115 --> 00:47.106
Anyone who would kill me
could now come after you.

00:47.107 --> 00:50.200
From now on, I am the only one
you can trust.

01:00.925 --> 01:02.525
Klaus, voice-over:
My memory of Lucien goes back

01:02.526 --> 01:05.128
to a time when
our family was happy.

01:05.129 --> 01:07.597
Things were good,
or as good as they can be

01:07.598 --> 01:10.266
for vampires hiding
in plain sight.

01:10.267 --> 01:12.602
Everyone in Marseilles
was held in the thrall

01:12.603 --> 01:16.005
of the count's
arrogant son Tristan

01:16.006 --> 01:19.008
and his sister...
The lady Aurora.

01:19.009 --> 01:20.710
In hindsight,
I could've done more

01:20.711 --> 01:24.981
to prevent what was to follow,
but then, even an endless life

01:24.982 --> 01:26.816
cannot be played in reverse.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.318
It's impressive work, milord.

01:28.319 --> 01:30.487
It's a trifle meant
to pass a dull day,

01:30.488 --> 01:33.456
but I'll take it along
with the word of a friend.

01:33.457 --> 01:36.059
It is as a friend
that I come to you now.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.627
There is something
I must ask of you.

01:42.266 --> 01:44.667
For the lady Aurora.

01:44.668 --> 01:46.302
If you would deliver
this to her in secret,

01:46.303 --> 01:48.303
I would be eternally grateful.

01:48.305 --> 01:51.007
Are these declarations of love?

01:51.008 --> 01:53.309
That's a bold move.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.912
Well, we shared affection

01:55.913 --> 01:57.680
for one another when
we were children,

01:57.681 --> 01:59.682
but since then,
my station in life

01:59.683 --> 02:02.918
has prohibited me from
declaring my intentions.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.921
If she would leave
this place with me...

02:04.922 --> 02:07.557
Not an idea I would advise.

02:07.558 --> 02:10.160
Besides, my family needs you.

02:10.161 --> 02:13.396
But your family staying here

02:13.397 --> 02:15.665
cannot last much longer, anyhow,

02:15.666 --> 02:18.401
not given your brother
Kol's decadence.

02:18.402 --> 02:19.869
The local religious believe

02:19.870 --> 02:21.571
they are beset by demons.

02:21.572 --> 02:24.174
Soon, you'll need to run.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.609
Aurora and I can run with you,

02:26.610 --> 02:28.778
aid you in your endeavors.

02:28.779 --> 02:31.581
Niklaus, please.

02:31.582 --> 02:33.383
I would give her
the note myself,

02:33.384 --> 02:35.251
but Tristan's jealousy
is tyrannical.

02:35.252 --> 02:37.453
I cannot go near her,

02:37.454 --> 02:41.924
but you... you need not
fear him or anyone.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.569
Klaus, voice-over:
Hoping to dissuade Lucien,

02:52.570 --> 02:55.104
I told him Aurora
would not accept his note.

02:55.105 --> 02:58.006
I thought the matter settled.

02:58.008 --> 02:59.842
How could I tell him that Aurora

02:59.843 --> 03:01.643
was already in love
with another?

03:06.450 --> 03:10.486
But Lucien was
a hopeless romantic.

03:10.487 --> 03:13.289
In his desperation,
he sought her out.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.058
No.

03:15.059 --> 03:17.260
You were not meant to see this.

03:17.261 --> 03:18.995
I trusted you.

03:18.996 --> 03:21.898
Quiet. I'm meant
to be in prayer.

03:21.899 --> 03:23.600
If anyone finds you here...

03:23.601 --> 03:26.102
It's too late.
The guards are coming.

03:26.103 --> 03:28.504
My handmaids must
have seen him enter.

03:28.505 --> 03:29.906
Well, if the guards know, then

03:29.907 --> 03:31.174
Tristan himself will be alerted.

03:31.175 --> 03:32.742
I will deal with them.

03:32.743 --> 03:35.078
No, Niklaus.
He's my brother.

03:35.079 --> 03:36.579
Do you think he cares?

03:36.580 --> 03:37.847
Do you not know what manner

03:37.848 --> 03:39.115
of man you are with?

03:39.116 --> 03:40.183
He is a beast.

03:40.184 --> 03:41.284
Lucien, my friend...

03:41.285 --> 03:43.052
We are not friends.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.621
Go now, please,

03:45.623 --> 03:48.024
please, by the window,
same as you came.

03:48.025 --> 03:51.027
Niklaus, go, please.

03:51.028 --> 03:52.929
Lucien.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.998
Lucien, go.
There is no time.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.498
Hurry.

03:58.669 --> 04:00.802
You.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.141
Take him.

04:05.142 --> 04:07.043
Klaus, voice-over:
And, given the circumstance,

04:07.044 --> 04:09.379
Lucien qualifies
as both friend and foe,

04:09.380 --> 04:11.114
and according to
Freya's prophecy...

04:11.115 --> 04:12.949
You have to beware of
both friend and foe,

04:12.950 --> 04:15.685
but let us not forget
family, Niklaus.

04:15.686 --> 04:17.387
Lucien's two out of 3.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.688
I say we put him down,

04:18.689 --> 04:19.988
just like old times.

04:19.990 --> 04:21.524
Just like old times?

04:21.524 --> 04:22.992
Brother, I wonder
who among our family,

04:22.993 --> 04:24.127
do you suppose, has the greatest

04:24.128 --> 04:25.728
predilection for betrayal.

04:25.729 --> 04:26.863
Brother, please.

04:26.864 --> 04:28.665
Now, before we murder Lucien,

04:28.666 --> 04:31.200
there are certain questions
that need to be answered,

04:31.201 --> 04:35.772
chiefly, what is he doing here?

04:35.773 --> 04:37.974
And the wolf venom.

04:37.975 --> 04:41.377
Why would he lie
to you, his sire?

04:41.378 --> 04:43.212
I'm afraid we might
have to resort

04:43.213 --> 04:45.747
to something deliciously
medieval here, brother.

04:45.749 --> 04:48.318
"We."

04:48.319 --> 04:50.486
I take it you will
lower yourself

04:50.487 --> 04:54.022
to associate with
your bastard brother, then.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.128
Have you finally forgiven me?

04:59.129 --> 05:01.029
I will consider it...

05:02.099 --> 05:03.566
When Hayley forgives you,

05:03.567 --> 05:05.568
Gia rises from the dead,
and hell freezes over.

05:05.569 --> 05:07.170
For now, however,
let's just hope

05:07.171 --> 05:08.771
your little friendship
with Lucien

05:08.772 --> 05:10.572
doesn't disrupt our mission.

05:15.545 --> 05:17.546
[knocks on door]

05:24.254 --> 05:26.222
Mr. Castle, detective Kinney,

05:26.223 --> 05:28.124
Nola pd.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.760
Was hoping to ask
you a few questions.

05:30.761 --> 05:34.063
By all means.
Your place or mine?

05:34.064 --> 05:36.699
Cami: Every one of the victims
has the same profile...

05:36.700 --> 05:39.135
Grew up rich, family
comes from old money,

05:39.136 --> 05:41.070
successful, educated,
white males

05:41.071 --> 05:42.805
living a playboy lifestyle.

05:42.806 --> 05:45.241
So it is one guy, not a copycat.

05:45.242 --> 05:46.642
Not just any guy.

05:46.643 --> 05:48.210
It's Lucien... I'd bet
my degree on it...

05:48.212 --> 05:49.779
Which doesn't excuse
your detective friend

05:49.780 --> 05:51.948
from stealing my laptop.

05:51.949 --> 05:53.282
[Beep]

05:53.283 --> 05:56.452
Oh, that's convenient.
It's Kinney.

05:56.453 --> 05:59.321
They got Lucien at the station.

05:59.323 --> 06:00.790
I should head down there.

06:00.791 --> 06:02.125
They might need the type of help

06:02.126 --> 06:03.326
a gun can't provide.

06:03.327 --> 06:04.827
I'll come with you.

06:04.828 --> 06:07.430
I want to hear
what he has to say.

06:07.431 --> 06:09.297
[Door opens]

06:14.822 --> 06:16.690
Hey! It's not jazz fest.

06:16.691 --> 06:19.091
Some of us have toddlers
who need to sleep.

06:22.263 --> 06:24.598
[Crying]

06:24.599 --> 06:26.398
Ugh...

06:27.568 --> 06:29.034
[Door opens]

06:31.639 --> 06:33.440
You all right?

06:33.441 --> 06:35.208
Oh, she was having
a really nice nap

06:35.209 --> 06:37.077
until that stupid
music woke her up.

06:37.078 --> 06:38.779
How...
how are we supposed to live

06:38.780 --> 06:40.147
with all this noise?

06:40.148 --> 06:42.448
You're just sensitive to it, ok?

06:42.450 --> 06:44.618
We spent 6 months
as wolves in the bayou.

06:44.619 --> 06:46.052
We've been back a day.

06:46.053 --> 06:48.121
I think it's ok to take
a minute to adjust.

06:48.122 --> 06:50.624
Easy for you to say.
You're not half vampire.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.592
Everything for me is heightened.

06:52.593 --> 06:53.960
It's not just the noise.

06:53.961 --> 06:56.596
I'm claustrophobic.
My skin is crawling.

06:56.597 --> 06:58.130
I'm irritable.
I'm hungry.

06:58.132 --> 07:00.667
[Hope cries]

07:00.668 --> 07:02.803
I wanted to be
with her so badly,

07:02.804 --> 07:06.072
and now I am,
and I just feel off.

07:06.073 --> 07:08.375
Well, you got to let it out.

07:08.376 --> 07:10.076
Well, if talking won't cut it,

07:10.077 --> 07:11.678
I have an idea that will.

07:11.679 --> 07:12.779
What are you doing?

07:12.780 --> 07:14.815
Calling Freya to baby-sit.

07:14.816 --> 07:16.817
See, this unpacking
can wait, all right?

07:16.818 --> 07:19.319
I'm taking mommy
out for the day.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.954
Long as this serial killer's
in the news,

07:20.955 --> 07:23.323
cops are gonna be all over
this city like a rash,

07:23.324 --> 07:25.859
so for now,
no feeding on tourists,

07:25.860 --> 07:28.028
and don't even think
about going near the locals.

07:28.029 --> 07:31.164
So what, then,
puppies and bunnies?

07:31.165 --> 07:32.833
Josh, you can talk
to our contacts

07:32.834 --> 07:34.601
at the blood banks
and hospitals.

07:34.602 --> 07:36.870
Let them know
you'll be coming by.

07:36.871 --> 07:39.840
For the rest of you,
keep everyone else in line.

07:39.841 --> 07:41.775
All we got to do is ride it out.

07:41.776 --> 07:43.743
Klaus and Elijah
will get it sorted out,

07:43.744 --> 07:45.812
and we'll be back
to business in no time.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.814
Woman: Somehow I doubt that.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.883
Your current dilemma
will get worse

07:49.884 --> 07:52.352
before it gets better.

07:52.353 --> 07:56.188
The good news is, I can help.

07:57.058 --> 07:59.526
I don't know who you are,

07:59.527 --> 08:02.195
but you definitely walked
into the wrong place.

08:02.196 --> 08:04.164
I'm Aya.

08:04.165 --> 08:06.733
Nice to meet you, Marcel Gerard.

08:06.734 --> 08:08.335
Now, are you going to be rude,

08:08.336 --> 08:10.237
or are you going
to offer me a drink?

08:10.238 --> 08:13.406
Hmm. I don't have time for this.
Get her out of here.

08:13.407 --> 08:14.640
A shame.

08:14.642 --> 08:16.776
I'd heard you were
more hospitable.

08:16.777 --> 08:18.445
What a disappointment.

08:18.446 --> 08:19.779
Uh!

08:19.780 --> 08:21.081
Uh!

08:21.082 --> 08:23.116
Uh!
[Crack]

08:23.117 --> 08:24.851
Uh...

08:24.852 --> 08:26.920
Thing is, I was instructed

08:26.921 --> 08:29.822
not to leave without
making you an offer.

08:31.025 --> 08:34.126
Will you hear my offer, or not?

08:35.395 --> 08:37.130
[Growls]

08:37.131 --> 08:39.499
Lucien?

08:39.500 --> 08:41.868
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.035
Alexis: I'm afraid
you missed him.

08:47.541 --> 08:49.275
Where is he?

08:49.277 --> 08:51.077
At the police station.

08:51.078 --> 08:53.880
A detective Kinney
had some questions for him.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.583
And he allowed himself
to be arrested?

08:56.584 --> 09:00.820
He has nothing to hide.

09:00.821 --> 09:03.088
Lucien's occupied.

09:03.090 --> 09:07.794
Perhaps we should entertain
ourselves right here.

09:07.795 --> 09:11.531
Oh.
Well...

09:11.532 --> 09:14.900
I've never been one
to turn down a snack.

09:22.576 --> 09:24.611
Kinney: Mr. Castle,

09:24.612 --> 09:27.079
thought you might
want to see this.

09:32.086 --> 09:36.121
I read about this.
Oh, those poor men.

09:38.125 --> 09:40.392
Oh, they were, in life,
anything but poor...

09:40.394 --> 09:42.896
Solid gold cufflinks,
Bulgari watches.

09:42.897 --> 09:44.798
Such ostentatious
displays of wealth

09:44.799 --> 09:46.199
no doubt attracted the attention

09:46.200 --> 09:47.934
of some vile, criminal element.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.369
You seem to know a lot
about the case.

09:49.370 --> 09:51.304
Big fan of true crime?

09:51.305 --> 09:52.906
[Chuckles]

09:52.907 --> 09:56.175
Look at my watch,
Mr. Kinney, my cufflinks.

09:56.177 --> 09:57.610
But for a twist of fate,

09:57.611 --> 09:58.979
one of those faces
might be mine.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.046
Well, you sound real frightened

10:00.047 --> 10:01.748
by the prospect.

10:01.749 --> 10:04.017
You know, in my experience

10:04.018 --> 10:05.652
people like you
don't believe in fate.

10:05.653 --> 10:07.520
They make their own luck,

10:07.521 --> 10:11.024
whether it's good or bad.

10:11.025 --> 10:14.160
Well, then I shouldn't
be here long.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.529
People like me tend to have
exceptional lawyers

10:16.530 --> 10:19.299
to get us out
of trouble like this,

10:19.300 --> 10:22.369
but while I'm here,
you should know

10:22.370 --> 10:26.006
that I do hate to be bored,

10:26.007 --> 10:28.541
and you bore me.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.143
I know that behind that mirror

10:30.144 --> 10:34.180
is Cami O'Connell,
and I would very much like

10:34.181 --> 10:37.249
to talk to her alone.

10:40.087 --> 10:42.755
[Exhales]

10:44.558 --> 10:46.859
[Door opens]

10:48.329 --> 10:49.661
[Door closes]

10:55.483 --> 10:58.688
[Creak]

11:00.688 --> 11:04.891
Pretty sure that Marcel
opened this place for vampires.

11:04.892 --> 11:07.159
Well, you said yourself,
you're part vampire.

11:07.161 --> 11:08.362
Figured it'd be a good place

11:08.363 --> 11:09.963
for you to blow off some steam.

11:09.964 --> 11:11.565
You might feel better
if you hit something,

11:11.566 --> 11:13.033
even if it's me.

11:13.034 --> 11:14.434
I can't cut loose
with you, Jack.

11:14.435 --> 11:16.203
You'll get hurt.

11:16.204 --> 11:17.738
I have an advantage,
being, you know,

11:17.739 --> 11:19.473
I'm dead.

11:19.474 --> 11:21.441
Here.

11:21.442 --> 11:23.410
You got muscle and a bad temper,

11:23.411 --> 11:26.913
but I'm pretty good
with one of these things,

11:26.914 --> 11:28.915
might make us even,

11:28.916 --> 11:31.584
at least enough
to get a workout in.

11:32.654 --> 11:34.855
I get what you're doing, Jack.

11:34.856 --> 11:36.590
I'm just... I'm really
not in the mood

11:36.591 --> 11:39.225
for some half-assed
sparing match, so...

11:39.227 --> 11:41.728
[Bo clatters]

11:41.729 --> 11:43.397
Are you gonna stand there
whining all day,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.331
or you gonna show me
what you got?

11:54.575 --> 11:55.908
Huh!

11:57.278 --> 11:58.545
Hah!

11:58.546 --> 12:00.112
Huh huh!
Huh!

12:01.282 --> 12:03.949
That's my girl.

12:10.058 --> 12:11.625
No. You're not going in there.

12:11.626 --> 12:13.660
Vincent, he's not
going to kill me

12:13.661 --> 12:16.830
in the middle
of a police precinct.

12:16.831 --> 12:19.832
[Door opens and closes]

12:21.903 --> 12:23.770
You asked to speak to me.

12:23.771 --> 12:25.772
Here I am, willing to listen,

12:25.773 --> 12:27.107
which, if I'm gonna be honest,

12:27.108 --> 12:28.607
is more than you deserve.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.377
I thought New Orleans had
the same burden of proof

12:30.378 --> 12:32.245
as the rest of the colonies.

12:32.246 --> 12:35.716
What is it? Ah, yes...
Innocent until proven guilty.

12:35.717 --> 12:39.052
Vincent: The murders started
the same day you got into town.

12:39.053 --> 12:41.221
All the victims match a pattern,

12:41.222 --> 12:44.623
wealth that, uh, you
yourself seem to exude,

12:44.625 --> 12:47.461
not to mention
we know what you are.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.296
Hmm.

12:49.297 --> 12:52.265
What I am is a ruthless,

12:52.266 --> 12:54.835
vicious, unstoppable killer.

12:54.836 --> 12:56.503
That's not to say I had anything

12:56.504 --> 12:59.306
to do with this, far from it.

12:59.307 --> 13:02.409
Why bother denying it
if you are what you say you are?

13:02.410 --> 13:04.644
Cami, you don't know me,

13:04.645 --> 13:06.179
but if you did, you would see

13:06.180 --> 13:08.682
that we were the same,

13:08.683 --> 13:10.951
all 3 of us, actually...

13:10.952 --> 13:12.519
3 souls caught in the orbit

13:12.520 --> 13:15.622
of family Mikaelson
yet somehow survived

13:15.623 --> 13:18.258
to tell the tale,
though each of us

13:18.259 --> 13:21.193
has our share of scars.

13:23.364 --> 13:24.898
[Crack] Aah!

13:24.899 --> 13:27.300
[Panting]

13:27.301 --> 13:30.470
Aah!
Ahh. Ahh...

13:30.471 --> 13:32.305
Have you two come to watch

13:32.306 --> 13:34.974
as Lucien receives
his punishment?

13:34.976 --> 13:36.910
I fear I'm being
a touch lenient,

13:36.911 --> 13:39.045
given his intentions
for my sister.

13:39.046 --> 13:41.548
Why torture a loyal servant?

13:41.549 --> 13:43.683
I'm sure this is all
a misunderstanding.

13:43.684 --> 13:46.286
One that remains
outside your concern.

13:46.287 --> 13:48.889
As son of the count,
I may discipline staff

13:48.890 --> 13:50.357
as I see fit.

13:50.358 --> 13:52.192
Should you take issue,
then I'll need

13:52.193 --> 13:55.227
to remind you
that you are a guest.

13:56.497 --> 13:57.764
Aah!

13:57.765 --> 14:00.600
Step away from him now.

14:00.601 --> 14:02.735
[Panting]

14:04.572 --> 14:06.373
I know what you are.

14:06.374 --> 14:08.241
Our house servants
speak of demons

14:08.242 --> 14:09.676
hunting in the night.

14:09.677 --> 14:12.179
I myself interviewed
one such maiden,

14:12.180 --> 14:14.080
quite pretty, thus far,

14:14.081 --> 14:16.049
the only survivor
of these attacks.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.118
I asked what manner of creature

14:18.119 --> 14:19.753
had hunted her.

14:19.754 --> 14:21.788
She said she was certain

14:21.789 --> 14:23.890
it was the lord Kol

14:23.891 --> 14:26.293
but with the face of a beast.

14:26.294 --> 14:28.862
Your entire family
sought refuge here

14:28.863 --> 14:30.697
claiming to be noblemen when,

14:30.698 --> 14:32.432
in fact, you are fiends.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.935
I can only surmise
that you are hiding,

14:34.936 --> 14:37.637
which means you're afraid.

14:37.638 --> 14:39.639
Somewhere out there, something

14:39.640 --> 14:42.408
is even more savage than you.

14:48.282 --> 14:49.649
Nngh! Agh...

14:49.650 --> 14:53.253
This is not going
to be pleasant.

14:53.254 --> 14:55.822
[Grunting]

14:55.823 --> 14:58.625
Do so at your peril,

14:58.626 --> 15:02.395
but should any
misfortune befall me,

15:02.396 --> 15:03.964
know that I have instructed

15:03.965 --> 15:05.599
my fastest riders to spread word

15:05.600 --> 15:07.434
of your presence here.

15:07.435 --> 15:09.436
Whomever seeks you

15:09.437 --> 15:11.071
would most certainly
hear the news.

15:11.072 --> 15:13.739
Niklaus, release him.

15:15.076 --> 15:16.809
Please.

15:23.017 --> 15:25.151
See? We're not so different,
after all.

15:25.152 --> 15:27.854
You wish to protect your family.

15:27.855 --> 15:31.824
I wish to protect mine.

15:34.962 --> 15:37.497
[Gasping]

15:37.498 --> 15:39.532
Aah!

15:39.533 --> 15:42.268
[Moaning]

15:47.508 --> 15:50.043
Even after all these years,

15:50.044 --> 15:52.345
you continue
to re-enact your trauma.

15:52.346 --> 15:54.814
You're choosing victims who are
the contemporary equivalent

15:54.815 --> 15:58.350
of the privileged son
who hurt you.

15:59.987 --> 16:01.821
[Exhales]

16:01.822 --> 16:04.724
I share a deeply
personal tale of woe,

16:04.725 --> 16:06.459
one meant to garnish sympathy

16:06.460 --> 16:09.362
and inspire kinship,
yet all you take away

16:09.363 --> 16:12.032
is an admission of guilt.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.067
Messed-up new guy comes to town,

16:14.068 --> 16:17.404
messed-up new guy is
responsible for murders.

16:17.405 --> 16:19.239
Uh, ok. Heh.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.474
Given that you seem
incapable of comprehending

16:21.475 --> 16:23.443
a sophisticated solution,
allow me to posit

16:23.444 --> 16:25.312
an equally simple one.

16:25.313 --> 16:28.515
These murders are an attempt
to disparage my good name,

16:28.516 --> 16:30.750
thus poisoning me
against the one person

16:30.751 --> 16:34.521
I came here to protect...
Niklaus himself.

16:34.522 --> 16:36.523
Now, if someone wants to weaken

16:36.524 --> 16:39.225
my ability to protect Niklaus,

16:39.226 --> 16:42.162
perhaps it's because
they themselves

16:42.163 --> 16:44.496
would like to see him dead.

16:48.569 --> 16:51.838
Aya: I have to say,
I'm impressed.

16:51.839 --> 16:53.239
Given that I'm 3 times your age,

16:53.240 --> 16:55.207
you held your own quite well.

16:55.209 --> 16:58.144
That's me.
Never know when to quit.

16:58.145 --> 17:00.245
Uh!

17:01.615 --> 17:02.582
Ah...

17:02.583 --> 17:04.084
I suspect we could go at this

17:04.085 --> 17:07.387
for quite some time,
but, as I said,

17:07.387 --> 17:09.789
I've been instructed
to make you an offer,

17:09.790 --> 17:11.358
and since you seem so intent

17:11.358 --> 17:12.726
on defending your humble abode

17:12.727 --> 17:14.127
and maintaining
your reputation in front

17:14.127 --> 17:16.061
of this motley retinue, we'll

17:16.063 --> 17:20.265
adjourn to somewhere
more appropriate.

17:21.102 --> 17:23.470
Ah! Uh!

17:23.471 --> 17:25.003
Uhh...

17:25.006 --> 17:27.071
[Panting]

17:28.075 --> 17:29.676

17:36.817 --> 17:39.118
Ohh...

17:43.557 --> 17:46.593
How much longer
is this going to take?

17:46.594 --> 17:49.029
Elijah and I can begin now,

17:49.030 --> 17:50.397
but just us.

17:50.398 --> 17:51.998
Sadly, I've already
shown you what visions

17:51.999 --> 17:53.832
of yours I've managed to divine.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.301
The warning
was for both of us...

17:55.302 --> 17:56.503
Friend, foe, and family.

17:56.504 --> 17:58.904
I'd like to see his, please.

18:00.841 --> 18:03.610
Since family is one
of your concerns

18:03.611 --> 18:05.311
and you two are brothers,

18:05.312 --> 18:08.148
are you so sure you want to see

18:08.149 --> 18:11.617
what I have to show you?

18:13.454 --> 18:17.122
Oh, I never could
resist a good spoiler.

18:39.513 --> 18:42.549
Well, at least
your visions were specific.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.785
It seems Lucien has
intentions for Camille.

18:45.786 --> 18:49.389
And what of Marcel,
family and friend?

18:49.390 --> 18:51.356
Where do his loyalties lie?

18:51.358 --> 18:52.659
Find him and question him.

18:52.660 --> 18:53.893
And where are you going?

18:53.894 --> 18:55.528
I'm going to eliminate
an old friend

18:55.529 --> 18:59.064
before he gets his teeth
into my therapist.

19:16.084 --> 19:17.547
Come on.
Focus!

19:18.332 --> 19:20.433
Every full moon,
every time I would

19:20.434 --> 19:22.602
turn human, I would
look at our pack,

19:22.603 --> 19:25.071
at you, and all I could
think about was...

19:25.072 --> 19:26.839
Blood. I get it.
No, Jack.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.807
You don't get it.
It wasn't just blood.

19:28.809 --> 19:30.442
It was...

19:32.246 --> 19:35.982
It was Klaus...
What he did to us,

19:35.983 --> 19:38.484
his gloating, Davina using us.

19:38.485 --> 19:40.787
If she blows out that candle,

19:40.788 --> 19:42.789
we're back to being wolves,

19:42.790 --> 19:44.023
and what if I'm holding hope?

19:44.024 --> 19:45.358
You ain't gonna hurt her.

19:45.359 --> 19:47.927
Every day, every day,
all I can think about

19:47.928 --> 19:50.163
is ripping everything apart.

19:50.164 --> 19:51.364
Ok. Well, come on, then.

19:51.365 --> 19:52.932
Get it out of your system,
all right?

19:52.933 --> 19:54.533
Are you gonna stand there
feeling sorry for yourself?

19:54.535 --> 19:56.636
[Growls]

19:56.637 --> 19:58.871
Uh! Uh!

19:58.872 --> 20:02.707
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to.

20:09.049 --> 20:11.918
Uh...

20:11.919 --> 20:14.219
You should go.

20:15.689 --> 20:17.689
I'm not going anywhere.

20:19.326 --> 20:22.662
I'm not afraid, Hayley.

Uh.

Ohh... God.

21:11.745 --> 21:14.614
Joshua...

21:14.615 --> 21:16.282
Would you kindly enlighten me

21:16.283 --> 21:19.385
as to what happened here?

21:19.386 --> 21:22.655
Ohh... God, this woman.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.624
What woman?

21:24.625 --> 21:26.692
I don't know.

21:26.693 --> 21:29.729
She walked in
like she owned the place,

21:29.730 --> 21:32.365
said she had to talk
to Marcel in private.

21:32.366 --> 21:34.567
We tried to get rid
of her, and, boom,

21:34.568 --> 21:37.003
smackdown city,
which, obviously,

21:37.004 --> 21:39.271
went quite well.

21:44.077 --> 21:47.413
Did this woman
happen to have a name?

21:47.414 --> 21:51.116
I don't know.
Um, Aya?

21:52.152 --> 21:54.086
Aya. Let me guess...

21:54.087 --> 21:57.156
5'7", built like a goddess,
vicious as a viper.

21:57.157 --> 21:59.525
So you know her.

21:59.526 --> 22:02.794
I sired her.

22:04.798 --> 22:07.098
[Sizzling]

22:10.904 --> 22:14.340
You're an intelligent man,
so I won't insult you.

22:14.341 --> 22:17.576
We both know that nothing
you say proves anything,

22:17.577 --> 22:20.813
so what I want to know
is why you asked to speak to me.

22:20.814 --> 22:22.949
Why tell me your story?

22:22.950 --> 22:24.850
Is it because I know Klaus
and part of you

22:24.851 --> 22:26.786
must still blame him?

22:26.787 --> 22:28.154
Maybe you want
to make him look bad

22:28.155 --> 22:30.222
in the eyes of a friend.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.425
Ha! I'm so...

22:32.426 --> 22:36.629
Oh, now I know why Klaus
is so taken with you,

22:36.630 --> 22:39.365
that delicious,
mortal mind framing

22:39.366 --> 22:42.735
every moment of
your meager life span.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.336
Huh?

22:45.872 --> 22:49.308
The truth is, I know
you have Klaus' ear,

22:49.309 --> 22:52.010
and I need him to trust me.

22:52.012 --> 22:53.779
As for your claim
that I blame him

22:53.780 --> 22:57.817
for my ancient wounds,
well, time heals all wounds,

22:57.818 --> 23:02.354
and my wounds healed
a thousand years ago.

23:05.225 --> 23:07.158
Uh...

23:07.995 --> 23:11.364
I brought you water.
Drink.

23:11.365 --> 23:12.999
Mm.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.266
[Slurp]

23:14.267 --> 23:16.535
Ugh...

23:16.536 --> 23:17.837
Oh...

23:17.838 --> 23:19.671
What did you do to me?

23:22.509 --> 23:24.275
Oh...

23:27.748 --> 23:31.250
I am sorry, my friend.

23:31.251 --> 23:33.119
[Panting]

23:33.120 --> 23:35.955
[Grunts]

23:35.956 --> 23:38.858
Are you mad?

23:38.859 --> 23:41.027
You know what I am.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.695
Uh!

23:42.696 --> 23:44.530
This rage is pointless.

23:44.531 --> 23:46.098
Aagh!

23:46.099 --> 23:48.868
You cannot hurt me!
Ah!

23:48.869 --> 23:51.002
[Panting]

23:55.275 --> 23:58.410
[Panting continues]

24:00.213 --> 24:02.714
[Panting continues]

24:09.156 --> 24:10.890
[Panting continues]

24:10.891 --> 24:13.926
My blood...

24:13.927 --> 24:16.127
Healed you.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.935
I am like you?

24:25.539 --> 24:28.374
Lucien, voice-over:
Of course, I wasn't, not yet,

24:28.375 --> 24:30.643
not that it would
have mattered, anyway.

24:30.644 --> 24:32.311
All I wanted was revenge.

24:32.312 --> 24:33.679
[Gasps]

24:33.680 --> 24:35.381
Tristan.

24:35.382 --> 24:39.317
How, by all that is damned,
are you free?

24:39.319 --> 24:40.453
Raagh!

24:40.454 --> 24:43.154
Rrgh!
Uh...

24:48.628 --> 24:51.596
Uh! Mm!

24:54.234 --> 24:58.137
And so I died
for a little while.

24:58.138 --> 25:01.340
Talk about trauma,
not the wounds themselves

25:01.341 --> 25:05.744
or even the execution,
but the humiliation

25:05.745 --> 25:08.981
of being judged by one's
supposed betters.

25:08.982 --> 25:12.183
I will never again stand
for such judgment...

25:15.822 --> 25:17.923
Though for you, Camille,

25:17.924 --> 25:21.427
I will gladly declare
my innocence.

25:21.428 --> 25:23.329
In fact, I can prove it.

25:23.330 --> 25:24.864
Prove it how?

25:24.865 --> 25:27.500
Well, if by nothing else,
then, perhaps, logic.

25:27.501 --> 25:29.668
Why should I undermine
my own safety

25:29.669 --> 25:32.138
by leaving behind
a trail of dead bodies?

25:32.139 --> 25:35.040
I mean, why commit myself
to these preposterous murders?

25:35.041 --> 25:38.377
Unlike my enemies,
I have nothing to gain.

25:38.378 --> 25:40.312
Your enemies?

25:40.313 --> 25:42.248
You really think someone
is trying to frame you for this?

25:42.249 --> 25:43.782
Who?

25:43.783 --> 25:45.985
Now, isn't that the question
we should be asking,

25:45.986 --> 25:49.555
and how fortunate
it's one I can answer?

25:49.556 --> 25:51.357
I'd have thought
your time with me would inspire

25:51.358 --> 25:53.425
a more careful selection
of company you keep.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.693
We're leaving.

25:54.694 --> 25:56.695
Klaus, he says he knows
who the killer is.

25:56.696 --> 25:58.063
Whatever Lucien's
said to you today

25:58.064 --> 25:59.698
has more certainly been a lie.

25:59.699 --> 26:01.567
Oh, come on, Nik.
Why should I lie?

26:01.568 --> 26:03.969
For the same reason you lied
about avoiding a werewolf bite

26:03.970 --> 26:06.272
when Elijah saw it
with his own eyes.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.007
This ends now.

26:08.008 --> 26:10.676
Then you're giving Tristan
the victory he seeks.

26:10.677 --> 26:13.244
He is the guilty one.

26:15.749 --> 26:18.884
I'm going to need
a word with Lucien

26:18.885 --> 26:20.351
in private.

26:21.555 --> 26:24.556
Vincent: Come on, Camille.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.694
Ah...

26:33.300 --> 26:36.268
Uh... uhh...

26:36.269 --> 26:39.038
What the hell did you do to me?

26:39.039 --> 26:42.240
Scratched you with a toxin
of my own devising.

26:42.242 --> 26:44.810
Kicks like a mule, doesn't it?

26:44.811 --> 26:47.713
Here. This should help.

26:47.714 --> 26:49.915
Plenty more where
that came from.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.383
My friends and I could help

26:51.384 --> 26:54.886
with your daylight ring
situation, as well.

26:56.890 --> 26:59.992
Ok. Now you have my attention.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.293
Marcel Gerard,

27:02.295 --> 27:04.430
you were turned by an original,

27:04.431 --> 27:06.432
yet you made yourself
in your own image.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.867
You built a vampire
community from ash,

27:08.868 --> 27:11.904
and this city thrived
under your rule.

27:11.905 --> 27:14.573
Let us help you
return New Orleans

27:14.574 --> 27:18.743
to what it should be
with you as its king.

27:20.614 --> 27:22.915
A great sales pitch, really.

27:22.916 --> 27:27.453
Just one thing...
Who's us?

27:27.454 --> 27:29.321
The oldest society of vampires

27:29.322 --> 27:31.257
this world has ever known.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.558
We are called The Strix.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.995
Elijah: Quite the prestigious
organization

27:35.996 --> 27:37.997
responsible for countless wars,

27:37.998 --> 27:39.999
numerous plagues,
assassinations.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.101
You have to break rules

27:42.102 --> 27:45.136
if you want to build
a new world.

27:46.640 --> 27:50.576
Hello, Elijah.
It's been a while.

27:50.577 --> 27:52.478
You two know each other.

27:52.479 --> 27:54.145
Intimately.

27:55.515 --> 27:56.815
Ugh...

27:56.816 --> 27:59.118
What ever you are doing here,

27:59.119 --> 28:01.086
I know you're not alone.

28:01.087 --> 28:03.188
Tristan: Let her go, Elijah.

28:03.189 --> 28:05.991
No need for this
to become vulgar.

28:05.992 --> 28:07.226
[Gasps]

28:07.227 --> 28:09.694
And... there he is...

28:11.298 --> 28:13.164
Tristan.

28:21.499 --> 28:24.000
[Aya gagging]

28:24.001 --> 28:25.402
You go left?
I go right?

28:25.403 --> 28:28.738
Why don't you stay
where I can see you?

28:28.739 --> 28:30.840
Tristan: It's been ages
since I've enjoyed

28:30.841 --> 28:34.243
a good scrap, but, uh,
it's not why I'm here.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.750
Mr. Mikaelson
and I require the room.

28:40.751 --> 28:42.017
Please leave us.

28:50.728 --> 28:54.431
Elijah, your sire line,

28:54.432 --> 28:56.366
your life is at stake.

28:56.367 --> 29:00.103
You want to hear
what I have to say?

29:00.104 --> 29:03.038
Marcellus, please...

29:04.675 --> 29:06.776
And you would do well
to be selective

29:06.777 --> 29:08.744
about the company
you keep in future.

29:10.714 --> 29:13.116
Maybe you should remember
who your friends are.

29:13.117 --> 29:15.884
It looks like
you're gonna need them.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.090
Klaus: What ever Tristan's role
in this charade may be,

29:20.091 --> 29:23.059
have no fear,
I will discover it.

29:23.060 --> 29:26.029
First, I'm going to
drain you of vervain.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.031
Then I'm going to ask
you a few questions,

29:28.032 --> 29:30.967
and once you've answered
if I'm feeling sentimental,

29:30.968 --> 29:33.203
perhaps I'll Grant you
a painless death.

29:33.204 --> 29:36.071
Please.
Enough posturing.

29:36.073 --> 29:37.774
Ask me anything you want.

29:37.775 --> 29:40.810
As I've said, I am only
here to protect you.

29:40.811 --> 29:44.080
And yet you lied about
your werewolf bite. Why?

29:44.081 --> 29:46.249
I simply didn't want
to bother you.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.784
Don't you have greater concerns

29:47.785 --> 29:50.819
than a little wolf bite
that I can cure on my own?

29:52.289 --> 29:55.391
Let's discuss
these absurd murders.

29:55.392 --> 29:57.794
If it were true that I was
scattering bodies about

29:57.795 --> 29:59.929
and scarring up faces,
then you'd be right

29:59.930 --> 30:02.632
to assume
I'm mentally unstable...

30:02.633 --> 30:06.136
I'm not, by the way...
But who would benefit most

30:06.137 --> 30:08.238
from you thinking that I am?

30:08.239 --> 30:10.106
Who else but Tristan?
Ah.

30:10.107 --> 30:11.774
Because if you don't trust me,

30:11.775 --> 30:14.144
if you kill me and are
forced to stand alone,

30:14.145 --> 30:16.745
wouldn't that benefit him?

30:19.083 --> 30:21.818
It's a very interesting theory,

30:21.819 --> 30:27.924
only I don't need
your protection.

30:27.925 --> 30:30.660
I'm quite capable
of protecting myself.

30:30.661 --> 30:32.962
Undoubtedly,

30:32.963 --> 30:35.030
but who looks after
your family, hmm,

30:35.032 --> 30:37.834
your friends, Camille,
for instance?

30:37.835 --> 30:40.770
Such associations
make you vulnerable

30:40.771 --> 30:42.905
and, thus, in need of me.

30:42.907 --> 30:45.474
[Sighs]

30:47.111 --> 30:48.978
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:48.979 --> 30:51.681
I'm Mr. Castle's legal consult,

30:51.682 --> 30:54.851
here to ensure justice
is served.

30:54.852 --> 30:56.786
Hmm. Well, your client's

30:56.787 --> 30:58.188
not gonna need you today.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.689
We found another body.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.291
This one's fresh.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.059
It couldn't have been you.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.361
You're free to go, Mr. Castle.

31:05.362 --> 31:07.964
Don't leave town.

31:07.965 --> 31:11.800
And, like a Phoenix, I rise.

31:13.771 --> 31:17.306
Do think about what I said, Nik.

31:23.080 --> 31:27.550
Elijah: You waltz into
my city unannounced

31:27.551 --> 31:30.319
with your flock of sycophants

31:30.321 --> 31:31.888
flaunting news of a threat.

31:31.889 --> 31:34.424
All the while,
your little lapdog Aya

31:34.425 --> 31:37.359
is conspiring with none
other than Marcel Gerard.

31:37.361 --> 31:39.662
"Conspiring." How grandiose.

31:39.663 --> 31:41.030
I thought I was the one

31:41.031 --> 31:42.098
with a flair for the dramatic.

31:42.099 --> 31:43.999
Watch your tongue.

31:46.870 --> 31:50.240
I am not the patient,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.709
fun-loving social butterfly

31:52.710 --> 31:56.079
you might recall.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.348
Your Marcel is
a potential recruit.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.782
He has nothing to do with

31:59.783 --> 32:01.317
the larger issue we face.

32:01.318 --> 32:03.286
The larger issue?

32:03.287 --> 32:04.921
You've no doubt
heard about the war

32:04.922 --> 32:07.257
between the sire lines.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.192
Well, as it happens, your line,

32:09.193 --> 32:11.127
thanks to my strix,
has wreaked all manner

32:11.128 --> 32:14.029
of havoc on Lucien
and his assorted interests.

32:14.031 --> 32:16.199
As a result, he's
desperate to exterminate

32:16.200 --> 32:19.201
the lot of us... me, Aya,
everyone you sired.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.803
Of course, the economical way

32:20.804 --> 32:22.338
to complete this task
would be for him

32:22.339 --> 32:25.341
to kill you.

32:25.342 --> 32:27.377
You don't believe me.

32:27.378 --> 32:30.079
Perhaps you underestimate
Lucien's ambition.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.614
While I doubt he'd have the gall

32:31.615 --> 32:33.483
to attack you directly,
I believe he might try

32:33.484 --> 32:35.952
and find someone else to do it,

32:35.953 --> 32:39.889
namely Niklaus.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.924
What makes you so certain
that Niklaus

32:41.925 --> 32:44.861
would select Lucien
over his own family?

32:44.862 --> 32:46.229
From what I hear,

32:46.230 --> 32:47.630
he tortured his friend Marcel,

32:47.631 --> 32:48.965
cursed the mother of his child,

32:48.966 --> 32:50.966
and burned your paramour
in front of you,

32:50.968 --> 32:52.869
all because he thought
it the logical way

32:52.870 --> 32:54.737
to defeat his enemy.

32:54.738 --> 32:56.839
With Lucien in his ear,

32:56.840 --> 32:58.808
how long before
the logical thing

32:58.809 --> 33:00.777
is to get rid of you?

33:00.778 --> 33:02.645
Well, how very fortunate,
indeed, then,

33:02.646 --> 33:04.681
Niklaus is on his way right now

33:04.682 --> 33:07.849
to put Lucien out of
our collective misery.

33:07.851 --> 33:09.152
You have to stop him.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.619
And why would I do that?

33:10.621 --> 33:11.854
Lucien's seer believes
there's an object

33:11.855 --> 33:13.790
capable of killing you.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.191
I'm well aware.

33:15.192 --> 33:16.426
Well, I don't have it.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.493
I'm quite certain my sister

33:17.494 --> 33:19.161
doesn't have it, either.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.496
Logically, then, one must assume

33:20.497 --> 33:23.031
that Lucien has it
or he knows where it is.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.501
If he dies, none
of us will find it,

33:25.502 --> 33:27.003
not until some other assassin

33:27.004 --> 33:29.872
attempts to use it against you.

33:29.873 --> 33:31.941
If you've any hope
of finding that

33:31.942 --> 33:33.976
which can kill us all,

33:33.977 --> 33:36.511
Niklaus needs to be stopped.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.201
For the record, Vincent
thinks you should kill him,

34:01.202 --> 34:02.736
but you can't execute someone

34:02.737 --> 34:04.371
without, you know, due process.

34:04.372 --> 34:07.107
Are we really going to have
a legal debate about this?

34:07.108 --> 34:09.076
He said something

34:09.077 --> 34:11.844
about rising like a Phoenix.

34:11.846 --> 34:14.246
What did that mean?

34:14.248 --> 34:17.384
Lucien has a taste
for hyperbole,

34:17.385 --> 34:21.053
although in this case,
he's rather on point.

34:31.766 --> 34:33.766
Do you really think
it was your blood

34:33.768 --> 34:35.034
that healed him?

34:35.036 --> 34:37.036
I saw it with my own eyes.

34:37.038 --> 34:40.473
When I found his body,
I tried to feed him more,

34:40.475 --> 34:45.745
and... nothing.

34:48.049 --> 34:50.250
So then we...

34:50.251 --> 34:53.453
We only heal the living.

34:53.454 --> 34:56.054
That's peculiar.

34:57.792 --> 35:00.359
I know this can't
be easy for you, brother.

35:04.766 --> 35:07.667
[Inhales]

35:07.668 --> 35:09.769
[Exhales]

35:12.140 --> 35:14.775
[Gasps]

35:14.776 --> 35:16.175
[Coughing]

35:21.082 --> 35:22.715
What...

35:27.880 --> 35:31.591
Cami: He's the first
person you ever turned.

35:31.592 --> 35:33.727
Is that why this is
so hard for you,

35:33.728 --> 35:36.929
because he's the first
of your sire line?

35:44.939 --> 35:47.140
Klaus, if he's not lying,

35:47.141 --> 35:49.443
if he is telling the truth,
if he is here to help you,

35:49.444 --> 35:51.945
you don't have to kill him.

35:51.946 --> 35:53.947
Camille, so eager to keep me

35:53.948 --> 35:56.750
from a mistake I might regret.

35:56.751 --> 36:00.753
It means more than you know.

36:06.794 --> 36:09.728
[Whoosh]

36:26.564 --> 36:27.881
We should talk.

36:27.882 --> 36:29.182
It's too late for that.

36:29.183 --> 36:30.851
Lucien has to die.
You said so yourself.

36:30.852 --> 36:33.352
I have new information.

36:33.354 --> 36:36.189
Brother, if you desire
any kind of reconciliation

36:36.190 --> 36:39.658
with me, stay your hand.

36:50.046 --> 36:52.181
[Slurping]

36:52.182 --> 36:54.683
Ahh...

36:54.684 --> 36:57.152
Ah... oh.

36:58.522 --> 36:59.989
Ha ha ha!

36:59.990 --> 37:03.025
Oh, you do not know
all that you are missing.

37:03.026 --> 37:06.162
Ahh... hoo!

37:06.163 --> 37:08.097
Ah... ah...

37:08.098 --> 37:10.699
I feel as though I have
left the fog of winter

37:10.700 --> 37:13.869
to enter the most
glorious springtime.

37:13.870 --> 37:16.672
Please. My family.

37:16.673 --> 37:19.308
Klaus: Lucien, no.

37:19.309 --> 37:21.544
Th... this will not
go unnoticed.

37:21.545 --> 37:23.012
Now we will have to leave.

37:23.013 --> 37:24.646
I know you despise me.

37:24.648 --> 37:26.982
Uh, no. Ha ha ha!
Not anymore.

37:26.983 --> 37:30.452
Ah, this change in me.

37:30.453 --> 37:35.524
We are as alike now
as brothers, are we not?

37:35.525 --> 37:39.662
It seems so.

37:39.663 --> 37:41.663
Then teach me, Niklaus.

37:41.665 --> 37:44.567
Uh...

37:44.568 --> 37:47.552
Teach me to be what we are.

37:51.675 --> 37:53.976
Gladly.

37:53.977 --> 37:57.746
[Hisses] Aah!

37:57.747 --> 38:00.415
And now I reap what I sowed.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.652
I should have killed him
in that chapel.

38:03.653 --> 38:06.755
Yet you played
right alongside him,

38:06.756 --> 38:08.524
succumbing to your savagery.

38:08.525 --> 38:10.725
He brought out the worst
in you, Niklaus.

38:10.727 --> 38:12.994
We brought out the worst
in each other.

38:14.497 --> 38:17.066
In some ways, we made
each other who we are.

38:17.067 --> 38:19.235
Well, the moment
we have that weapon,

38:19.236 --> 38:23.171
we will end him, he and Tristan.

38:24.374 --> 38:28.577
It is good to hear
that word again...

38:28.578 --> 38:31.614
"We."

38:31.615 --> 38:33.949
It's purely circumstantial,

38:33.950 --> 38:36.018
let me assure you, brother.

38:36.019 --> 38:38.227
This is not forgiveness.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.198
I've claimed righteousness

38:49.199 --> 38:53.576
in my actions towards
you and Hayley...

38:54.771 --> 38:56.472
But perhaps I did stray

38:56.473 --> 38:59.081
a little too far from
the shores of reason.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.079
Freya's prophesy speaks

39:04.080 --> 39:07.950
of family against family,

39:07.951 --> 39:10.718
and I want you to know...

39:15.825 --> 39:19.427
You will never fall by my hand.

39:48.959 --> 39:51.327
[Exhales]

39:51.328 --> 39:52.962
Dude, is it just me,
or is vampire blood,

39:52.963 --> 39:54.296
like, a thousand times harder

39:54.297 --> 39:56.264
to get out than normal blood?

39:59.235 --> 40:01.519
Hey, you ok?

40:02.605 --> 40:05.007
I'm not sure
what's more annoying,

40:05.008 --> 40:07.810
The Strix coming into my home

40:07.811 --> 40:10.486
or Elijah dismissing me
like some kid.

40:22.792 --> 40:25.494
So now what, back to square one?

40:25.495 --> 40:28.030
If Lucien isn't the killer...

40:28.031 --> 40:31.065
Then what the hell are
we really dealing with?

40:34.938 --> 40:36.905
[Indistinct conversations]

40:36.906 --> 40:41.944
[Police radio chatter]

40:41.945 --> 40:44.078
[Siren]

40:53.790 --> 40:56.257
[Cell phone vibrates]

40:59.529 --> 41:02.263
[Buzz]

41:04.675 --> 41:06.268
[Beep]

41:06.269 --> 41:08.103
Aurora: Tristan, it's me.

41:08.104 --> 41:11.573
I've been feeling
a little cooped up,

41:11.574 --> 41:13.776
so I've decided
to cut my stay short.

41:13.777 --> 41:16.289
I'll be in New Orleans shortly.

41:16.290 --> 41:19.638
Don't start the party
without me.
