every rebel camp in the Republic.

- Where?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.793
Rebel headquarters, downtown Annapolis.
To tell them about this.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.474
What if I was able to get the rebels
missile launchers?

00:21.640 --> 00:23.438
A guy I used to work with can help us.

- Hey, John.

- Flynn. Randall Flynn.

My senior officers.

Militia officers? Why should we trust
them any more than we trust you?

03:17.360 --> 03:20.159
Because when I tried
to assassinate Monroe...

...they were the guys that backed me up.

These guys can fight.
They can turn all these kids into fighters.

- Jim Hudson, for starters.

That is, if you can find him.

about two miles east of here.

Charlie, you can't go on a raid.
Listen to me.

This is too dangerous.
Don't do this. Not right now.

MONROE: Those are the pendants.
RANDALL: Two of them.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.673
And I think I can guess who's got them.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.159
So you can track them?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.397
When the pendants are turned on, yes.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.833
So every so often, I flip them on remotely,
give them a little ping to see where they are.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.719
Neat trick, right?
A woman named Grace taught me.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.309
And why haven't you collected
them before?

06:27.520 --> 06:33.471

I didn't have the resources.
