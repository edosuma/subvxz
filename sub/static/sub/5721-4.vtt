WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.862
Hello, loyal followers.
It's Alexa, back from Oregon.

00:03.910 --> 00:05.559
[laughs]

00:05.610 --> 00:08.477
Got to love the Beaver State.

00:08.530 --> 00:13.308
There's trees galore,
awesome hiking.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.480
But I went because

00:16.530 --> 00:20.091
of their physician-assisted
suicide law.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.051
This brain tumor,

00:23.110 --> 00:25.499
this glioblastoma multiforme--

00:25.540 --> 00:29.328
which sounds like
the worst IKEA piece ever--

00:29.370 --> 00:30.803
it, um...

00:30.850 --> 00:32.454
[Alexa snifï¬‚es, coughs]

00:32.510 --> 00:34.455
It just keeps getting
worse and worse.

00:34.510 --> 00:38.412
So... Ijust dined
on some applesauce du jour

00:38.470 --> 00:41.462
with broken-up
pentobarbital mixed in.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.728
My last supper.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.294
Some gallows humor.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.772
Ijust...

00:54.140 --> 00:56.608
_ I canft live
With the paIn anymore.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.619
I don't want to live with
only mIsery to look forward to.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.183
MAN:
You can see

01:03.230 --> 01:05.755
why I want this video
excluded from trial, Your Honor.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.574
It is intended
to bias the jury.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.359
CANNING: Bias is exactly what
I'm trying to avoid, Your Honor.

01:09.410 --> 01:12.584
The fully-abled have a bias
of-of the blessed.

01:12.630 --> 01:15.019
They can't fathom
what it would be like to have

01:15.070 --> 01:17.937
to make a decision like the one
Alexa Banner had to make.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.503
MAN:
And yet, sad

01:19.550 --> 01:22.769
as Ms. Banner's story is,
this video has no relevance...

01:23.770 --> 01:25.510
Sorry, Your Honor.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.248
It-it, uh...
it is merely an attempt...

01:31.910 --> 01:34.640
...to... ah.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.258
Here, I...

01:36.310 --> 01:37.607
Look, I can give...

01:37.660 --> 01:40.003
CANNING: Oh, thank you.MAN: Yes.

01:40.050 --> 01:43.008
[clears throat] Uh, the bottom
line is that what Doctors Pogue

01:43.050 --> 01:45.189
and, uh, Brinton did
is illegal.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.619
Hence, this wrongful death suit.
State law

01:47.670 --> 01:50.628
is very clear.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.013
Physician...

01:53.060 --> 01:54.618
Um...
[laughing]:
Your Honor.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.678
Uh...

02:00.030 --> 02:02.157
Uh, physician-assisted...

02:02.200 --> 02:04.589
Um...

02:04.640 --> 02:06.505
suicide.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.118
It's... _
[cane clatterIng]

02:08.170 --> 02:10.559
[clears his throat]
I, uh...

02:10.600 --> 02:12.295
JUDGE: You were talking
about state law,

02:12.340 --> 02:14.558
which you seem to
believe is very clear.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.862
MAN: Thank you.
Who's winning?

02:16.910 --> 02:18.992
CANNING: Um, my clients
can speak to Alexa's...

02:19.050 --> 02:21.302
Excuse me?
Between the two,
who's winning?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.910
Uh, I have no idea.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.440
I think you do.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.093
Do I know you?[cane clatters]

02:30.150 --> 02:32.186
Your Honor...
MAN:
I don't even think

02:32.230 --> 02:34.278
Canning needs
those canes.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.106
I think they're props.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.586
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but 1-1 have to focus on this.

02:39.630 --> 02:41.541
I know.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.150
I'm Mr. Dipple's
general counsel.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.760
Ethan Carver.

02:46.810 --> 02:51.509
Are you checking up on me?No. Him.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.948
The bottom line is that
this wrongful-death suit...

02:52.990 --> 02:54.423
That's why he's fired,

02:54.470 --> 02:56.199
and you're replacing him.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.125
[cane clatters]

02:58.170 --> 02:59.603
Mr. Dipple assured me

02:59.650 --> 03:02.084
that I would not have
to argue In court.

03:02.130 --> 03:05.566
What does "AW'I'I'W" mean
In a text?

03:05.620 --> 03:08.703
My role was to prep Mr. Oakman
and help him anticipate

03:08.750 --> 03:11.526
what the defense would argue,
that's all.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.797
"A word to the wise."

03:12.840 --> 03:15.274
Thank you.
God, I hate texts.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.629
It's the ugliest language
on the planet.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.274
Mr. Carver, I am not
arguing in court.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.106
You are, Ms. Lockhart.

03:21.150 --> 03:23.675
You've been prepping this
case for the last six months.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.108
But not to argue in court.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.025
_ This is _
an antn-euthanasra case.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.799
No, it's a
pro-parent case.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.896
The parents of a girl
who committed suicide...

03:30.940 --> 03:34.239
But Mr. Dipple wants to use this
in order to beat back advances

03:34.300 --> 03:36.245
in physician-assisted suicide,
right?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.734
I can't support that.
I am pro-euthanasia.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.681
Ms. Lockhart,
I hate being the bully here.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.776
I get very tense.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.730
Mr. Dipple compensates you
very well.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.133
If you don't take over
this case, we will lose.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.648
There is no one else who
knows It as well as you.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.656
As a devil's advocate.Yes, but

03:52.710 --> 03:55.486
who knows the advocate's
case better than the Devil?

03:57.360 --> 03:59.089
[loud chatter, baby crying]

03:59.150 --> 04:01.755
_ All ris_e! _
Court Is now In seSSIon.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.848
Let's get this show on the road.

04:03.890 --> 04:06.233
Gentlemen, good day.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.804
You have been arrested.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.761
It is our task today
to figure out whether

04:09.810 --> 04:12.415
you deserve bail and the amount.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.156
Think of it as the sorting hat
from Harry Potter.

04:15.210 --> 04:16.632
We're sorting you...

04:16.690 --> 04:17.941
So, where are we?

04:17.990 --> 04:19.981
I lead with 12,560 pounds.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.554
Come on, you do not.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.680
I got the last guy.
320 pounds.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.776
It was on his arrest report.So, who's second?

04:26.830 --> 04:28.991
We have a tie, Bernie, and...ALICIA: Good morning.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.779
Hello.
What'd I miss?

04:30.830 --> 04:32.650
We just got back from lunch,
and we're tied.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.827
LUCCA:
11,300 pounds: Alicia.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.610
11,250 pounds: Bernie.
A virtual tie.

04:37.660 --> 04:38.877
I'm sorry. What?
And Don

04:38.930 --> 04:40.579
brings up the rear.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.019
It's only 'cause
I get anorexic shoplifters.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.402
More sinned against
than sinning.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.408
Don at 9,650 pounds

04:46.460 --> 04:48.621
of anorexic shoplifters.ALICIA: Excuse me.

04:48.670 --> 04:50.809
But what are we
talking about here?

04:50.850 --> 04:52.192
"Perps by the Pound."

04:52.240 --> 04:54.242
LUCCA:
It's Shoplifting Day.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.724
Everyone with light fingers
gets processed today.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.499
And we're tied
at 11,300 pounds.

04:58.550 --> 04:59.983
LUCCA:
Virtually.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.817
Pounds of what?Perps. Clients.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.168
You clear enough cases,
you can beat Lucca.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.939
[laughs]
Are you guys serious?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.082
Yes, whoever wins

05:08.130 --> 05:09.904
gets first choice
of what days to work.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.781
You're competing over who
clears the most cases by weight?

05:12.830 --> 05:14.786
We'recompeting.0h, I'm not.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.788
Uh, you're in second place.
Yes, you are.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.001
SCHAKOWSKY:
Are we all understanding?

05:19.050 --> 05:20.529
None of you are indigent,
which means

05:20.580 --> 05:22.002
you must pay
for your own attorney.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.789
The Chicago Bar has provided us
with four bar attorneys.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.535
Please stand.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.105
They are available
for hire at your convenience.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.664
I want to be clear:
you do not need to hire them.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.938
If you do not hire them,
you will be pushed

05:32.980 --> 05:34.800
to the back of the
line, which means

05:34.850 --> 05:36.408
you will not be
sorted until tomorrow.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.711
Are we all
understandIng?

05:37.770 --> 05:40.591
Bully. Here we go. Ms. Quinn,

05:40.640 --> 05:42.983
you have males
98 through 117.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.941
Mr. Bukovitz,
118 through 135.

05:44.990 --> 05:46.719
Mr. Weingarten,

05:46.780 --> 05:49.248
136 to 151.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.211
And Mrs. Florrick,
152 to 170.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.216
Male number 118.SCHAKOWSKY:
All right, Matan...

05:53.260 --> 05:55.956
Male number 118.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.820
It's on your hand!
Look at your hand!

05:57.870 --> 06:00.486
SCHAKOWSKY:
Then the Class C felons,
and continuing on

06:00.530 --> 06:02.703
to the violent offenders.
We have to get through

06:02.750 --> 06:04.047
a third of these
before lunch.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.830
I've been appointed
your bond attorney...

06:06.880 --> 06:09.485
Male 98?
Where are you?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.531
Male 98?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.844
Too bad, Lucca.

06:13.890 --> 06:18.281
ALICIA:
Male 28, Daniel Rojas,
attempted shoplifting.

06:18.330 --> 06:22.938
Good. Good, yeah, keep Lucca
from winning. She always wins.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.026
I'm not playing.
Well, that's
fine with me.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.854
But what are you gonna
do, not clear his case?

06:26.900 --> 06:27.855
BUKOVITZ:
Do you speak English?

06:27.900 --> 06:29.640
WEINGARTEN:
Male 136.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.681
Male 152-- retail theft
in the amount of $45.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.163
What do you
got, Mr. Brody?

06:33.210 --> 06:34.859
A repeat offender.
Nine months probation.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.958
Mr. Mason pleads guilty,
Your Honor.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.956
SCHAKOWSKY
Good. Time served. Male 98!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.309
Good, wipe that cocky smile
off Bernie's face.

06:41.350 --> 06:44.569
I'm not playing.
I'm not!

06:44.620 --> 06:46.576
58, Ms. Brantley,
liquor store theft?

06:46.620 --> 06:49.441
[overlapping chatter]

06:49.490 --> 06:51.481
Uh, ma'am, over here.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.963
I'm innocent.
I really am.
BUKOVITZ:
Ma'am, thIs Is

06:54.020 --> 06:55.271
your first arrest.
The judge'll go easy on you,

06:55.320 --> 06:56.662
you'll get probation,
go home today.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.051
But I didn't
steal anything.

06:58.110 --> 07:00.419
It was a gift. I brought
it back so I could

07:00.460 --> 07:02.542
exchange it for something else.Look, there's no time for this.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.410
They're saying I was making
a false return, like

07:04.460 --> 07:06.416
I stole it so I
could get money.If you want to fight this,

07:06.460 --> 07:07.984
it'll take months of
your life and thousands

07:08.030 --> 07:09.634
of dollars
to defend yourself.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.021
You want to say I'm
guilty, but I can't.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.900
I can't look
at my kids and say...

07:12.950 --> 07:14.247
Look, there's no time
to discuss this.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.995
The state's attorney
might even add charges

07:16.040 --> 07:18.167
if you insist
on your innocence.He can do that?

07:18.220 --> 07:21.257
He can do whatever he wants.
He's a real son of a bitch.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.437
I don't care.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.005
I'm not guilty.
Okay.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.917
I'll talk to the prosecutor
and see what I can get, but

07:28.970 --> 07:31.438
you have to get yourself into
this new frame of mind, ma'am.

07:31.490 --> 07:33.219
You're under arrest.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.886
Sometimes it doesn't make a
difference if you did it or not.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.886
[baby crying]

07:37.930 --> 07:39.921
[sighs]

07:41.540 --> 07:43.019
You trying to guess my weight?

07:43.070 --> 07:46.062
Excuse me?

07:46.110 --> 07:47.805
I heard your friends laughing.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.933
You-you score points based
on your clients' weight, right?

07:50.990 --> 07:53.811
I'm not doing that, ma'am.

07:53.860 --> 07:56.465
Then what are you doing?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.428
He's lying.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.914
The prosecutor
can't add charges

08:07.960 --> 08:09.564
just because
you won't take a plea.

08:09.610 --> 08:12.431
[coughs]
Yeah.Hello. Um, Ms. Brantley,

08:12.490 --> 08:14.094
I'm Alicia Florrick,
and I'm a bar attorney...Okay, good news.

08:14.140 --> 08:16.313
Prosecutor's willing to play
ball-- probation, one year.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.873
No. You're fired.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.831
I want her.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.533
This is nothing more
than a ploy, Your Honor.

08:24.590 --> 08:26.535
This case should be tried
In Oregon, Your Honor,

08:26.590 --> 08:28.581
where my clients
have their practices.But Alexa Banner's

08:28.630 --> 08:30.939
suicide took place
here in Illinois,

08:30.980 --> 08:33.801
where physician-assisted suicide
is still illegal.Whoa.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.761
Mr. Canning, are you okay?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.629
Yeah, H... I will be in a
second. I just have to get...

08:38.690 --> 08:41.853
Your Honor,
um, Mr. Canning

08:41.910 --> 08:44.162
knows that an Oregon jury

08:44.210 --> 08:45.996
will be more
sympathetIc to NS case.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.166
This court...
How many?

08:47.220 --> 08:49.211
I got it.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.989
DIANE:
These doctors knew

08:51.050 --> 08:52.608
that the victim
was bringing drugs

08:52.660 --> 08:55.083
to Chicago
in order to kill herself.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.869
The trial should
take place here.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.968
I'm agreeing with Ms. Lockhart
on this one, Mr. Canning.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.534
[gavelbangs]

09:00.580 --> 09:03.879
CANNING:
Diane, why are
you doing this?

09:03.930 --> 09:06.057
You're fighting for a cause you
fundamentally don't believe in.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.055
Because you make me angry.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.324
Mr. Dipple has been very pleased

09:12.370 --> 09:14.543
with the work you've been doing
these last few months.

09:14.590 --> 09:19.857
So, keep it up... but keep
the billable hours down.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.686
[applause]We're happy to have
you here, Mr. Carver.

09:21.730 --> 09:23.686
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.778
I'm sure you're aware
the Illinois General Assembly

09:25.820 --> 09:27.902
is considering the Physician-
Assisted Suicide Act.

09:27.950 --> 09:30.646
Yes. The Medical
Coalition of Illinois

09:30.700 --> 09:32.088
recently dropped
their objections.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.734
That's a game-changer.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.087
And like California,

09:35.130 --> 09:36.779
it gives the governor
a path to approving it.

09:36.830 --> 09:39.264
I understand _
you know the governor's WIfe,

09:39.310 --> 09:42.131
Alicia Florrick.
You want us
to talk to her?

09:42.190 --> 09:45.000
Blocking physician-assisted
suicide is an issue

09:45.060 --> 09:46.357
Mr. Dipple feels in his gut.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.799
He wants to fight this
on every front possible.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.149
Alicia doesn't work here
anymore because

09:51.190 --> 09:53.624
Mr. Dipple didn't want her here.But let us see
what we can do.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.978
BUKOVITZ:
You're screwing me
out of my fee.

09:56.030 --> 09:59.067
You're trying to sabotage me
so you can take the day.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.190
You really think I care that
much about your little game?She was about

10:01.250 --> 10:03.548
_ to take the deal _
hi! you stuck your nose In It.What's g0Ing on?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.591
She's trying to screw
me out of my $135.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.722
No, your client is...Alicia, professional courtesy.

10:07.780 --> 10:10.419
We don't undercut each other, we
don't snake each other's fees.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.812
BUKOVITZ:
The Florricks apparently do.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.122
Need an election, just steal it.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.956
Go to hell, Bernie.
No.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.175
You want her and her 120 pounds
so much, fine. Go for it.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.394
SHERIFF:
130 to 140...

10:23.440 --> 10:25.226
SCHAKOWSKY:
Come on, female 42.
Retail theft

10:25.270 --> 10:26.999
in the amount of $899.
What's the offer?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.403
One year probation.Good. Defense?

10:29.450 --> 10:31.577
Uh, Your Honor, unfortunately
my client cannot allocute.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.712
Why?It's a good
offer, Judge,

10:33.760 --> 10:36.843
she stole a $899 sweater.He's right, ma'am.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.199
Your record could be sealed
SIX months after probatIon.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.798
But I didn't steal anything.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.155
Approach, Counselors.

10:48.030 --> 10:51.113
Sweeten the deal, Matan.
Now. It's her first arrest.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.866
I could live with six months.
But that's my basement.

10:53.910 --> 10:55.343
There. He did
his part.

10:55.390 --> 10:56.994
My client won't take it.Then do your damn job

10:57.040 --> 10:58.564
and sell it to her.

10:58.610 --> 11:00.089
And don't you dare
slow me down, Mrs. Florrick.

11:00.130 --> 11:03.691
I'll recall you in a
minute. Female 44,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.957
retail theft of $71.

11:06.010 --> 11:08.228
I can probably get her
to take six months

11:08.270 --> 11:09.919
with _a reducer
to a mIsdemeanor.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.312
No, I did my caving.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.009
I need a guilty plea.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.757
The prosecution is willing
to take it down to six months

11:16.800 --> 11:18.711
probation, but you'll
need to plead guilty.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.103
But all I did was
return a sweater.

11:21.150 --> 11:22.139
This is...

11:22.200 --> 11:24.156
I'm not admitting to anything.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.020
Maia, listen to me. You won't
serve one hour in jail.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.674
But it'll be
on my record.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.721
For six months, and then
you can have it sealed.

11:29.770 --> 11:32.238
Female 42.
Recalled.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.039
So, we, uh,
closing this out?

11:38.080 --> 11:40.162
My client pleads not guilty.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.860
Seriously? He offered you
six months. Six.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.911
Yes, but she cannot plead...Up here, Mrs. Florrick.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.139
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I tried.

11:51.180 --> 11:52.784
Give the rest of your
defendant sheets

11:52.840 --> 11:54.398
to the sheriff.
They're being distributed.

11:54.450 --> 11:55.872
What? Why?I know you
get paid

11:55.930 --> 11:57.147
by the case.
Call it

11:57.190 --> 11:58.532
quid pro quo for the time

11:58.580 --> 12:00.229
you're costing this court.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.009
Your Honor...You can sit on
that pew WIth your

12:02.060 --> 12:03.061
precious client until
preliminary hearings,

12:03.110 --> 12:04.759
for all I care.

12:04.810 --> 12:08.029
Female 65. Retail theft
in the amount of $93.

12:08.070 --> 12:09.844
Your Honor, this is unfair.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.858
Ma'am, when did you think
bond court was about being fair?

12:20.950 --> 12:23.032
What's going on?

12:23.090 --> 12:25.081
I'm being taxed.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.417
Remember me?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.508
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

12:52.550 --> 12:54.802
No, not at all.
Eli and I were just

12:54.860 --> 12:57.420
going over
the campaign scheduling.

12:57.470 --> 13:00.337
I like your office.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.985
Can't help but think of when
we started the firm here.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.818
So... I came to ask if you'd
lobby Peter on a bill.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.737
It's called the
Physician-Assisted Suicide Act.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.257
It'_|| hit Peter's desk
In a week or so.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.210
And you want me
to persuade him to sign it?

13:14.270 --> 13:16.261
No. Veto it.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.039
Really? Why is that?

13:18.100 --> 13:19.658
You wanted to return
to the firm.

13:19.710 --> 13:23.009
This could be
your ticket back.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.016
I don't understand.

13:25.060 --> 13:28.928
Well, Reese Dipple is the
reason you're not at the firm.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.323
You sway Peter
on this bill,

13:31.370 --> 13:34.100
and Dipple will
sprinkle rose petals

13:34.160 --> 13:35.969
as you step off
the elevator.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.374
No.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.636
I'm happy here, Cary.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.032
I like what I'm doing.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.251
It's not a lot of money.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.291
I know.

13:48.340 --> 13:51.161
Anyway, I ask
for something from Peter,

13:51.220 --> 13:52.699
he asks for something back.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.913
And I don't want to
be asked for anything.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.043
Especially not
physician-assisted suicide.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.569
WOMAN:
No mother should have to watch

13:59.620 --> 14:02.043
their child go through
what Alexa did.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.783
I just wish she could have
held on a little longer.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.398
But isn't that selfish?

14:05.450 --> 14:08.442
Why make her hold on if
she was in so much pain?

14:08.490 --> 14:10.663
Why not let her go?If she were terminal,
I could have let her go,

14:10.710 --> 14:12.314
but she wasn't.Objection, Your Honor,

14:12.370 --> 14:14.531
um, the witness
is-is not a medical expert.

14:14.590 --> 14:17.844
My clients can speak
to Alexa's condition.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.765
You'd be surprised what kind
of expert you can become

14:19.810 --> 14:21.368
when your child
gets brain cancer.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.854
Uh, ma'am, please.
Let me rule on the objections.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.591
Overruled.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.245
Mrs. Banner, the doctors here

14:29.300 --> 14:30.517
at the defense table said that

14:30.560 --> 14:31.424
your daughter wasterminal.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.074
They were wrong.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.860
A week before they
prescribed those suicide drugs,

14:35.910 --> 14:37.992
Duke University
announced a new treatment

14:38.050 --> 14:39.859
for glioblastoma
tumors.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.876
Let me help you
with those, Mr. Canning.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.310
And what was that treatment?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.009
The polio virus.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.449
It's introduced
into the tumorous brain cells

14:51.490 --> 14:53.629
so it won't reproduce
in the healthy ones.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.228
It destroys the tumor.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.407
And if your daughter
had been told

14:57.460 --> 14:59.883
that there was hope
in this treatment?

15:01.240 --> 15:03.242
She'd still be here.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.761
Would you like to take a minute,

15:05.810 --> 15:08.415
Mrs. Banner?No.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.166
If I knew about this treatment,
why didn't they?

15:11.210 --> 15:13.201
Why did they give her
drugs to kill herself

15:13.260 --> 15:15.330
instead of
giving her hope?

15:15.390 --> 15:17.608
That's not what doctors
are supposed to do.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.045
Mr. Crouse.

15:27.570 --> 15:30.130
Mrs. Florrick.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.090
You could've knocked.
My daughter's home.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.482
Didn't want to.

15:33.540 --> 15:34.962
I thought you found
another investigator.

15:35.020 --> 15:38.239
I felt rejected.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.010
Well... we were broke.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.972
Ah, so you found
a rich client now?

15:45.030 --> 15:47.021
We found a client.

15:47.070 --> 15:49.800
She's willing to pay for
three hours of an investigator.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.818
Really? How extravagant.
Starting now?

15:52.860 --> 15:55.943
Mm-hmm.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.719
She's telling the truth.
I bought the sweater

15:57.780 --> 15:59.998
for my daughter,
for her birthday.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.429
And do you have the receipt?No, I think I
threw it away.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.436
Do you know what day
you bought it, ma'am?

16:04.480 --> 16:05.515
Oh...

16:05.570 --> 16:07.822
Sunday before her birthday.

16:07.870 --> 16:09.132
August 16.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.000
Did you pay cash or credit card?Cash.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.393
Always cash.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.668
I'm guessing that's not good.It just makes it
more difficult

16:15.710 --> 16:18.019
for us to prove
that you bought it.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.051
You're not covering for your
daughter, are you, Mrs. Sachs?

16:22.150 --> 16:25.847
No. Have you ever shopped
at the store? At Salvatori's?

16:25.890 --> 16:27.676
No, ma'am.I have, a few times. Why?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.540
They don't want me
to shop there.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.899
They tend to make it
difficult for you.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.988
Not for you, but for us.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.986
Are you saying your daughter was
targeted because of her race?

16:36.030 --> 16:39.295
Yes. Actually,
I am saying that.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.511
My daughter is no thief.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.380
JASON:
Okay.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.478
Let me see what
I can find out.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.560
So this is your
new office?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.612
Yes, Jackie.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.174
It's not as big
as it once was.

16:55.230 --> 16:56.572
That's right.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.315
And you're dressing up more?

16:58.360 --> 16:59.531
No, these are my usual clothes.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.309
Are you sure?

17:01.360 --> 17:03.749
I don't remember you
showing so much cleavage.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.236
And you had a haircut.
It's very different.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.622
Yes.

17:08.670 --> 17:12.026
Many changes.
A world in transition.

17:12.070 --> 17:14.152
Mm.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.589
What is it you need
from me, Mr. Gold?

17:16.640 --> 17:20.076
Peter is being pressured
to take a stance on a bill

17:20.120 --> 17:22.463
legalizing
physician-assisted suicide.

17:22.510 --> 17:23.909
What? What stance?

17:23.950 --> 17:25.599
Against it.

17:25.650 --> 17:28.164
Against
physician-assisted suicide?Yes.

17:28.220 --> 17:29.642
But he doesn't believe that.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.602
That's probably true, but...

17:33.660 --> 17:35.651
the Catholic

17:35.700 --> 17:39.090
and conservative lobbies
have hIs ear.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.313
He'd probably want
to hear from you.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.089
A concerned member
of the family.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.756
But... only if you
have the time.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.489
I could make time.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.053
He has a new
campaIgn manager now.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.101
Ruth Eastman.

17:52.150 --> 17:54.106
She likes to limit
access to Peter,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.060
but just you tell her
you're his mother,

17:56.110 --> 17:57.634
and I'm sure
she'll make an allowance.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.853
MATAN: Judge, four different
times before, they found

18:01.900 --> 18:04.596
a client of yours guilty.ALICIA: Which prevents me from
mounting a proper defense.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.164
You know they're playing games.Objection.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.768
It's a perfectly reasonable
request, your Honor.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.424
Requests,
plural.

18:09.470 --> 18:11.518
She's asking for both
the SKU from the sweater

18:11.560 --> 18:13.039
and_the stor_e's
surveIIIance VIdeo.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.512
This is for
a lousy...What IS a SKU?

18:14.570 --> 18:16.219
A stock-keeping unit,
Your Honor.

18:16.260 --> 18:19.388
It's an electronic identifier
attached to every sales Item

18:19.440 --> 18:21.351
to keep it from
being stolen.Oh, God.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.651
Get up here, Mrs. Florrick.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.651
No, not you.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.966
This is not
To Kill a Mockingbird.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.238
This is not
Anatomy of a Murder.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.977
This is a constitutionally
mandated necessity.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.454
It is Lucille Ball
wrapping chocolates

18:38.500 --> 18:40.195
on an assembly line.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.153
Cases get processed, justice
is served for the greater whole.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.598
Not for you, not for her.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.198
For all people.

18:47.250 --> 18:51.380
And I will be damned if
I will allow you to gum it up.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.035
Motion denied.
Step the hell back.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.251
Then we request a continuance,
Your Honor.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.303
Preliminary hearings
are for the prosecution.

18:58.350 --> 19:01.217
Are you ready to
proceed, Mr. Brody?100%.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.488
Then call your first witness.Your Honor,
this is wholly unfair.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.088
Damn straight, Marie Antoinette.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.698
Because every other defendant
in this room

19:06.750 --> 19:08.399
and in that hallway isn't gonna
see their kids tonight,

19:08.450 --> 19:09.576
thanks to you.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.441
Now step back.

19:12.490 --> 19:14.310
You're on, Mr. Brody.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.496
DIANE:
You have

19:15.540 --> 19:18.145
glioblastoma multiforme,
is that correct?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.327
I had it.
Past tense.

19:20.370 --> 19:22.190
So your tumor-- the exact type

19:22.240 --> 19:23.673
that Alexa Banner
had-- Is gone?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.324
Yeah.

19:25.380 --> 19:28.986
Thanks to the Duke polio trial,
I am cancer-free.

19:29.030 --> 19:30.156
Elvis has left
the building.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.815
And when you were
ill, did you

19:32.860 --> 19:35.203
contemplate suicide?

19:35.260 --> 19:37.125
Every day for about a year.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.991
I didn't want
to go on.But then you found hope?

19:40.040 --> 19:41.302
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.306
Withdrawn.
Mr. Linklater,

19:43.350 --> 19:46.080
would you consider yourself
a medical miracle?Objection,

19:46.140 --> 19:48.176
miracl_es_ have no
baSIS In fact.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.790
Really?
I saw the '69 Mets.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.796
[gallery chuckles]

19:52.840 --> 19:56.094
How about a recess, Your Honor?

19:56.150 --> 19:57.663
What are you offering,
Mr. Canning?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.359
$1 million, no admission
of liability,

19:59.410 --> 20:02.015
and,uh,a
gag order.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.880
Okay. I will take that
to our client.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.157
Are you willing
to drop the gag order?

20:09.510 --> 20:11.671
No, that's-that's
non-negotiable.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.722
Then you can
expect a no.

20:18.730 --> 20:22.086
Dipple must be paying you
one hell of a retainer.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.904
That's a good offer
I made you in there.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.769
And our clients will hear it.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.172
This is such a farce.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.653
I mean, you
of all people support

20:28.700 --> 20:30.782
physician-assisted
suicide, Diane.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.264
When did you go mercenary?

20:33.310 --> 20:36.268
And who's paying your bills,
Louis?

20:36.320 --> 20:38.276
You win, more people
kill themselves,

20:38.320 --> 20:39.571
and the insurance
companIes save bIllIons

20:39.620 --> 20:41.235
on hospital
expenses.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.236
Yeah, sure,
I'm an insurance company shill.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.067
But they happen to be
on the right side of this issue.I'm not gonna

20:46.110 --> 20:47.498
_ ta ke_ lessons
In hypocrIsy from you.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.711
Carver and Dipple
don't care about your clients.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.453
They just want to raise
malpractice rates.

20:51.510 --> 20:54.673
Intimidate doctors
out of helping people die.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.630
Talk to your clients.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.239
See how much they really care
about gag orders.

21:05.170 --> 21:06.478
Mr. Gold, hi.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.033
Oh, my mom's not here.That's okay,

21:08.090 --> 21:09.569
I just came to drop
something off for her.

21:09.610 --> 21:11.305
This week's invitations.

21:11.350 --> 21:13.784
Women's group meetings
all over Iowa, bar functions.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.172
Any command
performances?

21:15.230 --> 21:17.004
They're tabbed red,
yellow, and green.

21:17.050 --> 21:18.312
Oh. Thanks.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.748
Actually, Grace,
do you have a minute?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.222
Sure, what's up?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.966
What do you think about
physician-assisted suicide?

21:25.020 --> 21:26.237
Why?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.589
You're still...

21:28.630 --> 21:30.234
Christian, right?

21:30.280 --> 21:32.157
Yeah, I'm still Christian.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.373
Well, I think your dad

21:34.420 --> 21:36.320
might need some advice

21:36.380 --> 21:41.374
from someone who is against
physician-assisted suicide.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.648
Edward Waller.
I'm a security officer

21:43.690 --> 21:45.942
at Salvatori's Department Store.MATAN:
And before that,

21:48.480 --> 21:50.562
training soldiers
in Iraq?Objection.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.089
Relevance.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.995
Oh, dear God. Are you serious?

21:54.050 --> 21:55.210
Overruled.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.568
Overr_uled.
Conhnue.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.088
I worked at Al Asad Air Base,
Anbar Province

22:00.140 --> 22:01.357
for two years.Mr. Waller,

22:01.400 --> 22:03.391
this is the report you filed

22:03.450 --> 22:05.133
on the theft by Maia Sachs.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.658
Does this accurately describe
the events of this past Tuesday?

22:07.710 --> 22:09.530
Sure does.
We see this ruse every day.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.276
Customer walks in
with an empty Salvatori bag.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.457
They rip the tags off some item,
drop the item in the bag,

22:14.500 --> 22:17.105
and pretend to
return it for cash.Thank you.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.673
Mr. Waller...We're done here, Mrs. Florrick.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.063
I... Excuse me?

22:21.120 --> 22:22.371
We're done here.
You can cross tomorrow.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.944
Factory whistle's blown.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.550
Your Honor, my-my cross
will only take a few minutes.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.386
SCHAKOWSKY:
Mrs. Sachs, you'll
be spending the night

22:28.430 --> 22:30.295
in the Cook County Jail
unless you choose to plead...

22:30.340 --> 22:33.696
Your Honor, this is...
this is blackmail.

22:37.390 --> 22:40.348
Plead or jail, Mrs. Sachs?

22:40.400 --> 22:43.437
I'm not pleading.Fine.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.219
Henry, would you please escort

22:45.270 --> 22:46.521
Mrs. Sachs to the
Cook County Jail?

22:46.580 --> 22:48.354
ALICIA:
Hang in there, Maia.
It'll be okay.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.139
SCHAKOWSKY:
And if it's not okay,
Mrs. Sachs,

22:50.190 --> 22:52.317
you can blame your attorney.

23:49.070 --> 23:51.334
Alicia, it's Jason.

23:51.380 --> 23:54.338
You ever argue a case
against racial profiling?

23:54.380 --> 23:55.642
ETHAN:
I'm optimistic.

23:55.690 --> 23:58.079
Wind's blowing our way.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.472
Is this a Trojan horse?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.124
Reese, may I call
you back?

24:01.170 --> 24:03.218
Trojan horse?

24:03.260 --> 24:05.399
To raise malpractice insurance.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.614
To make sure _no doctor
ever helps a dyIng patIent

24:08.660 --> 24:10.264
end his or her life?

24:10.310 --> 24:13.006
Yes, of course.
That's a secondary purpose.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.789
So this is the_ first
of many swts?

24:14.840 --> 24:16.660
Doctors are rarely moved
by ethical arguments

24:16.710 --> 24:18.223
against euthanasia.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.316
But they do understand money.

24:20.370 --> 24:24.329
Rising malpractice rates
tend to sharpen the mind.

24:24.370 --> 24:27.191
Do you know any terminally ill
people, Mr. Carver?

24:27.240 --> 24:29.982
I mean gravely ill
and in constant pain?

24:30.030 --> 24:32.635
Yes.And you don't think
that person has the right

24:32.680 --> 24:35.285
to end his
or her life?

24:35.340 --> 24:37.649
I don't think doctors should be
in the business of killing,

24:37.690 --> 24:39.555
if that's what you're asking.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.989
I know it's a strange concept.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.510
But I don't like
when categories get confused.

24:45.570 --> 24:49.267
_ When_a fireman starts fires _
Instead of puttIng them out. FahrenheIt 451.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.653
I thought you'd appreciate that.So you're fine

24:51.700 --> 24:55.352
with civilian volunteers helping
people die instead of doctors?No.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.448
But at least it would take
the veneer of medICIne away

24:57.490 --> 24:59.446
from it.I don't understand you people.

24:59.490 --> 25:01.833
We people?You want to get
government off our backs

25:01.890 --> 25:04.666
_ until it_ comes to issues _
lIke abortIon and euthanaSIa.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.359
A perfectly healthy woman
was allowed to kill herself

25:07.410 --> 25:09.549
at an assisted dying clinic
in Basel.

25:09.590 --> 25:11.546
She wasn't terminal,
she wasn't sick.

25:11.590 --> 25:13.808
Her only rationale was...

25:13.860 --> 25:15.725
she was afraid of getting old.

25:15.770 --> 25:17.818
And losing control.Doctors killed

25:17.860 --> 25:21.421
1,807 people last year
in Belgium.

25:24.430 --> 25:25.772
and if this were Belgium,
we would have something to argue

25:25.820 --> 25:27.776
about_...Do_minoes fall fast
In thIs country.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.161
Just ask gay couples

25:29.220 --> 25:30.699
getting married
in Alabama.Ouch.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.389
Ouch, my head is hurting

25:32.440 --> 25:34.135
from the
wrongness here.You ask anyone

25:34.180 --> 25:36.307
who survives a jump
from the Golden Gate Bridge

25:36.360 --> 25:37.918
what their last thought is...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.528
You've done a lot of that,
have you?

25:39.580 --> 25:42.538
...it's always this: what
a stupid mistake I just made.

25:42.580 --> 25:46.141
And that's why you would
take away their choice?I don't think this country

25:46.190 --> 25:48.442
should make_ it easier
for people to dIe.Not even

25:48.500 --> 25:50.058
the terminally ill?We should make it
easier

25:50.110 --> 25:51.759
to manage pain.
That should be the goal.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.198
Why not both?

25:54.850 --> 25:56.841
Do you want off this case?

26:01.860 --> 26:04.465
No.

26:04.510 --> 26:07.729
But I want it to be
about this case

26:07.780 --> 26:09.680
and not every case.

26:10.740 --> 26:13.868
Okay.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.865
Raptor is on-site.WOMAN:
It's Mrs. Florrick.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.343
MAN:
Copy that.
I've got eyes on Raptor.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.391
MAN 2:
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.090
RUTH:
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.404
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ruth Eastman,

26:26.450 --> 26:27.963
your son's
campaign manager.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.978
Oh, I love that purse.
It's very attractive.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.750
Thank you.
I need to speak to my son.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.325
Oh, he's in a meeting right now.
Why don't we talk for a minute?

26:36.370 --> 26:37.974
I was just pouring some tea.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.727
I'd love to. And maybe
after I speak to my son.

26:41.770 --> 26:44.682
Actually, I'm afraid
it's our standing staff meeting.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.982
Every Tuesday,
come hell or high water.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.292
Peter?

26:49.340 --> 26:50.944
Unfortunately, that won't work.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.604
O_ur aides
are Instructed:

26:52.650 --> 26:54.515
no interruptions,
no exceptions.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.562
Just give 'em 20 minutes.
Come on.

26:56.610 --> 26:58.737
Why don't we get
better acquainted in here?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.690
[phone rings]

27:00.740 --> 27:02.298
Oh, excuse me. Um...

27:02.350 --> 27:04.614
excuse me. Let me answer this,
and we'll talk.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.264
It'll just be a minute.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.743
Hello.

27:10.490 --> 27:14.108
[indistinct chatter]

27:14.150 --> 27:17.756
BRINTON:
Yes, I prescribed ten grams of
pentobarbital liquid to Alexa.

27:17.810 --> 27:20.278
And what steps did you take
before prescribing it?

27:20.330 --> 27:23.504
I examined Alexa and determined
she had a terminal illness

27:23.550 --> 27:25.598
that would likely cause
death within six months.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.768
And, of course,
I talked to her.About what?

27:28.820 --> 27:31.243
Whether this was voluntary.
Whether it was what

27:31.300 --> 27:32.517
she wanted. If
she was depressed.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.515
CANNING:
Sounds thorough.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.039
BRINTON:
I try to be.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.479
[phone buzzes]The law requires we
discuss every danger

27:36.520 --> 27:38.215
and issue before
we prescrIbe.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.251
But more than that, I thought
it was my responsibility.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.778
CANNING:
Thank you.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.617
Dr. Brinton, the law also says

27:45.660 --> 27:48.527
that patients need to be advised
of their alternatives.

27:48.570 --> 27:50.526
Did you tell Alexa
about the Duke study?

27:50.580 --> 27:52.832
That's not what the law means.
It means lIke hospIce care.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.757
So you didn't tell her
about the Duke study?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.313
BRINTON: _
No.But you knew about It?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.793
I knew it was in its
early stages, but the odds

27:58.850 --> 28:01.364
of success were very low.
At best, one in 20.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.366
I didn't want to
give her false hope.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.673
False hope?Yes.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.029
Patients look for any scrap
of good news from a doctor.

28:09.070 --> 28:11.118
But there was good news,
wasn't there?

28:11.160 --> 28:13.116
Not in my opinion.Don't you think

28:13.160 --> 28:15.333
the person who should have been
making that ultimate call

28:15.380 --> 28:17.769
was Alexa and not you?Objection.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.731
Badgenng.

28:19.780 --> 28:23.341
Pointed, yes. Badgering, no.
Overruled.

28:23.390 --> 28:24.698
BRINTON:
She did make
the ultimate call.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.651
Yes, but not with all
of the information.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.735
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

28:27.790 --> 28:28.825
You don't know that.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.050
I looked at the arrest records
out of the department store.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.965
It's almost
all African-Americans.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.750
_There's a racist
securIty guard?Or a spotter.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.756
What's a spotter?It's an undercover
shopper

28:43.800 --> 28:45.756
who keeps an eye out
for shoplifters.

28:45.810 --> 28:48.495
It's also possible the spotters

28:48.550 --> 28:50.848
are targeting African-Americans
just to...

28:50.900 --> 28:53.414
keep 'em away. It's like the
New York stores last year.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.676
Couple of 'em settled

28:54.730 --> 28:57.119
an attorney general's
investigation...

28:58.690 --> 29:00.203
What?

29:00.260 --> 29:02.820
That's her.

29:02.870 --> 29:04.679
That's one of the
ones they targeted.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.389
The goal is to get you
out of here.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.738
So your best move is
to plea and pay your fine.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.599
But I didn't
steal anything.Ms. Todd...

29:10.660 --> 29:13.743
Betty, you'll make your life a
lot easier if you do what I say.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.781
Let me talk to the prosecutor,
plead it out.

29:19.010 --> 29:20.796
Don't plead her out.What?

29:20.840 --> 29:21.920
Why?SCHAKOWSKY:
Female 62.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.278
I-I need 30 seconds with Matan

29:23.320 --> 29:25.276
on this one, Your Honor.You get 20.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.753
Salvatori's, the
department store,

29:26.800 --> 29:28.802
it's targeting
African-Americans.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.806
She didn't do it.Uh-uh, Alicia.
This isn't your case.

29:30.850 --> 29:33.102
Back the hell off.But I have a witness
who can testify.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.287
I don't care.
You're slowmg thIngs down.

29:35.330 --> 29:36.410
Can I change attorneys?

29:36.470 --> 29:37.414
Uh...

29:40.770 --> 29:43.079
[door opens]

29:43.120 --> 29:45.122
[indistinct chatter]

29:54.880 --> 29:57.826
Mom. I didn't _know
you were comIng In.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.223
I didn't realize
I needed an appointment.Oh,

30:00.270 --> 30:02.738
of course you don't.
No, please, sit, sit.

30:02.800 --> 30:06.839
I'd rather stand, Peter.
It's hard enough to...

30:06.890 --> 30:09.848
Uh, I came here

30:09.890 --> 30:13.678
intending to discuss an issue
of real importance to me,

30:13.720 --> 30:15.415
but now, uh...

30:15.460 --> 30:18.327
Well, your campaign manager,

30:18.380 --> 30:21.338
Ms. Eastman,
is not serving you well.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.598
And she's
disrespecting me.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.245
Now, whether you were
state's attorney or governor,

30:26.300 --> 30:28.768
I still always had access
to you.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.776
But now,
with this presidential run...

30:30.820 --> 30:32.253
Nothing's changed, Mom.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.824
...suddenly there's
a palace guard

30:33.870 --> 30:35.781
wearing a pantsuit
and cheap shoes,

30:35.830 --> 30:37.047
and she showed
no remorse...

30:37.090 --> 30:38.261
Mom, I think maybe...No, Peter,

30:38.310 --> 30:39.868
listen to me.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.876
She needs to get her priorities
straight,

30:41.920 --> 30:43.831
or you need to dismiss her.

30:45.320 --> 30:49.051
Okay, I will talk to Ruth.

30:49.100 --> 30:53.366
Do you want to now discuss this
issue of importance with me?

30:53.410 --> 30:55.366
[scoffs]

30:55.410 --> 30:58.368
No, I... I can't.
Not in this state.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.843
We'll have to talk about it
another time.Okay.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.629
Just so you know, I have
to go back to Iowa...

31:02.680 --> 31:05.945
Oh, Mrs. Florrick,
hi again...

31:08.080 --> 31:11.459
I just wanted to let you know
that your daughter stopped by,

31:11.520 --> 31:14.250
wanting to talk to you about the
physician-assisted suicide bill.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.904
ButI handled it.You what?

31:15.960 --> 31:17.769
What do you mean you handled it?

31:17.830 --> 31:19.730
First, you come
between a mother and her son,

31:19.790 --> 31:21.564
and now you feel comfortable
coming between a son

31:21.610 --> 31:22.952
and his daughter?

31:23.010 --> 31:25.399
RUTH:
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not what I mean.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.398
CANNING:
Is that why your wife wanted
to end her life,

31:28.450 --> 31:31.180
because
of the pain?Yes.

31:31.230 --> 31:34.973
Um, she was afraid she was
losing control over her life.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.796
CANNING:
Ms. Lockhart has
spoken a lot about

31:37.850 --> 31:40.364
this Duke brain tumor study.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.933
Would that have changed

31:41.980 --> 31:43.231
Alexa's mind
if she knew about it?Objection.

31:43.290 --> 31:44.939
Calls for speculation.Goes to state
of mind,

31:44.990 --> 31:46.287
Your Honor.Overruled.

31:46.330 --> 31:48.548
Alexa was beyond hope.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.592
She said she wanted to go out
on her own terms.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.200
CANNING:
Thank you.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.467
ALICIA:
Thank you for
coming today.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.387
And, Mr. Crouse, can you please
describe what you witnessed?

31:59.430 --> 32:02.957
Ms. Todd being
followed by a spotter

32:03.000 --> 32:06.470
and arrested, despite the fact
she didn't steal anything.

32:06.530 --> 32:08.259
Thank you.

32:11.050 --> 32:15.146
Mr. Crouse,
were you disbarred as a lawyer

32:15.190 --> 32:16.270
six years ago?

32:16.320 --> 32:18.538
I was.

32:19.930 --> 32:22.398
Because you punched a judge
after he found

32:22.460 --> 32:24.496
a client of yours
guilty.Objection. Relevance.

32:24.550 --> 32:26.108
Overruled.
Let's keep this moving.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.936
Yes.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.719
MATAN: And were you not
investigated by the bar

32:30.770 --> 32:32.112
four different
times before then

32:32.160 --> 32:33.377
for altering evidence,

32:33.420 --> 32:35.069
Objection!a|l in an effort

32:35.120 --> 32:37.554
to prove your clients
were innocent?This is beyond the pale.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.329
It's character
assassination 101.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.039
I don't care.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.469
Overruled.Why should we believe
your account

32:43.520 --> 32:44.862
of what happened
to Ms. Todd?Objection.

32:44.910 --> 32:46.992
Mr. Crouse's background
has no bearing

32:47.050 --> 32:49.951
on what he witnessed.And yet in my mind, it does.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.264
Why should you believe
my account?

32:53.310 --> 32:55.358
Because I'm telling the truth.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.448
Of course you are.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.182
BUKOVITZ:
No, no, I'm your lawyer.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.459
You can't change lawyers now.I don't want you.
I want thatlady.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.149
WOMAN:
Yeah. You should be
doing what sheis.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.974
Look, I don't care
what Mrs. Florrick is doing.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.634
The best way to get out
is to plead.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.285
Sure. If that's what you want.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.329
Congratulations.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.336
You've just stolen
another client.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.644
No, I didn't...
I wasn't...

33:34.750 --> 33:37.048
JACKIE: Grace, if you believe
in the sanctity of life...It's not a choice, Grandma.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.044
That's what the Bible commands.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.397
I went to Sunday school, dear.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.350
All right, I think
what Grandma's trying to say,

33:41.410 --> 33:42.832
Grace, is that,
when it come to euthanasia,

33:42.890 --> 33:44.664
there is possibly
a broader imperative.

33:44.710 --> 33:47.235
I can speak for myself,
thank you.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.454
Grace, all religions
preach respect

33:50.500 --> 33:51.842
for every human being.

33:51.890 --> 33:54.154
Which means respecting
their choices,

33:54.200 --> 33:55.758
including those
about end of life.

33:55.810 --> 33:57.505
But if there's
a higher authority...

33:57.550 --> 33:59.029
Then he wouldn't want someone

33:59.080 --> 34:00.593
with end-stage ovarian cancer

34:00.640 --> 34:02.164
[intercom beeps]to go on suffering.

34:02.210 --> 34:05.077
[over intercom]: Governor,
your wife is on the line.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.553
Grace, on this issue
I understand that...

34:07.610 --> 34:08.770
Alicia, hi.

34:08.820 --> 34:10.082
Oh.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.859
Veronica. Hello.

34:11.910 --> 34:13.912
They told me that...GRACE: No, but then,
all of a sudden,

34:13.960 --> 34:16.599
if we start-- if
that's something that
we have to decide...

34:16.660 --> 34:18.139
Uh, well, I appreciate it,
but I already have

34:18.180 --> 34:20.523
all _the research on _the _
phySICIan-aSSIsted SUIClde bIll.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.356
JACKIE:
We're talking about the doctors.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.140
Oh, well,
I have to go, Veronica,

34:25.190 --> 34:27.624
but I will tell Alicia
that we talked. Thanks.

34:29.890 --> 34:31.846
What the hell's going on today?

34:31.890 --> 34:33.938
When one family member
shows up, it's a surprise.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.800
When two do,
it's a coincidence.

34:35.850 --> 34:38.501
When three show up, it's Eli.

34:38.550 --> 34:40.108
He's messing with me,
Governor.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.593
I don't care.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.949
Do you hear me?
I don't give a damn.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.424
Your little skirmishes
are not my problem.

34:46.470 --> 34:49.644
I am running for the most
powerful office in the world.

34:49.690 --> 34:53.217
I need you to fix this, and I
need you to fix this right now.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.174
JACKIE: It's never
been our choice.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.656
[Grace and Jackie
continue arguing]

34:59.700 --> 35:02.009
One of our people
found it.

35:03.570 --> 35:06.698
They must have dug
pretty deep for this.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.571
Anything to help the cause,
Ms. Lockhart.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.881
Who is Karen Casavant?

35:14.800 --> 35:17.109
Mr. Stoke?She's my friend.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.139
Your girlfriend?Objection.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.100
Relevance.Goes to bias, Your Honor.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.889
Overruled.When did you
start seeing

35:21.940 --> 35:24.113
Ms. Casavant, sir?

35:24.160 --> 35:26.071
Seven months ago.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.817
So a month
before Alexa committed suicide?

35:33.130 --> 35:35.075
[heavy sigh]

35:35.130 --> 35:36.779
Oh.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.127
Sorry to scare you, honey.

35:38.170 --> 35:40.126
No, it's fine. Just...

35:40.180 --> 35:42.341
There are actually
over 60 different Bible verses

35:42.400 --> 35:44.482
that make it clear
how preCIous Me Is.

35:44.530 --> 35:47.784
Genesis 2:7.
Acts 17:25.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.707
Lutheran Church of Hope,
born and raised.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.969
I know where
you're comIng from.

35:54.020 --> 35:55.499
RUTH:
My nephew Andrew just joined

35:55.540 --> 35:57.053
the Marines right
out of high school.

35:57.110 --> 35:59.977
He could have been going
to an Ivy League college.

36:00.020 --> 36:03.194
Instead, he'll be doing push-ups
in the mud on Paris Island.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.379
But it's what he
needs right now.

36:05.420 --> 36:07.809
An ordering principle
for his life.

36:07.860 --> 36:08.986
Something to
believe in.

36:09.030 --> 36:11.555
I... H don't understand.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.113
Your granddaughter Grace.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.944
If they're not
idealistic at that age,

36:14.990 --> 36:16.901
when can they be?

36:16.950 --> 36:19.214
RUTH:
You're always gonna have
your dad's ear, Grace.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.036
And I promise you, you're
always going to have mine, too.

36:22.090 --> 36:24.081
We need you on this campaign.

36:24.130 --> 36:25.995
You're always going to have

36:26.050 --> 36:27.915
your boy's ear,
Mrs. Florrick.

36:27.960 --> 36:31.009
And I promise you you're
always gonna have mine, too.

36:31.050 --> 36:35.009
I'm realizing we need
you on this campaign.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.016
Yes. Thank you.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.096
And I'll tell you
something for nothing.

36:39.150 --> 36:41.789
The smartest men listen
to theIr women.

36:41.850 --> 36:44.842
And the smartest
women...

36:44.890 --> 36:47.632
are those with more
than a â€œthe experIence.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.456
Am I right?

36:50.510 --> 36:52.671
This is a list
of the clients I'm representing,

36:52.730 --> 36:55.460
all of whom were arrested
for theft at your store.

36:55.510 --> 36:57.239
_ You'll notice that
a dIsproportIonate number

36:57.300 --> 36:59.029
are African-Americans.

36:59.080 --> 37:02.072
This is the kind of thing
the Sun-Timeseats up,

37:02.130 --> 37:05.384
especially when there's
rumblings of a class action.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.217
On the other hand, if I could
see some security tape...

37:13.100 --> 37:15.318
[long sigh]

37:15.360 --> 37:18.136
The only thing more boring
than watching security footage

37:18.190 --> 37:20.704
is nothing.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.967
It's the best viewing
in the world.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.399
This gives you real insight
into human character.

37:32.070 --> 37:34.595
So you beat up a judge?

37:37.120 --> 37:38.633
I hit a judge.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.555
I wantedto beat
up a judge,

37:40.600 --> 37:43.034
but I got tackled
after the first punch.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.510
Hmm. Anger issues, maybe?

37:48.570 --> 37:50.822
I am the calmest,
sweetest man

37:50.870 --> 37:53.043
on the face
of the earth.

37:53.090 --> 37:55.217
But there are times...

37:55.270 --> 37:57.431
[chuckles]And there are people

37:57.490 --> 38:00.573
that sometimes just
don't listen to reason.

38:06.150 --> 38:09.142
Do I need
to worry about you?

38:10.940 --> 38:13.192
Yeah.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.060
Seriously, now.

38:15.110 --> 38:18.068
Why do you think
you got me so cheap?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.558
There's your client.

38:28.950 --> 38:31.168
ALICIA: Where is she going,
the register?

38:31.220 --> 38:32.869
Hard to tell
from here.

38:32.910 --> 38:36.175
Let's try a different angle.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.091
Well, that's unfortunate--
we can't see what she's doing.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.106
Wha-What are you doing?

38:50.150 --> 38:52.789
JASON: The day the mom
bought the sweater.

38:52.850 --> 38:54.363
ALICIA:
Smart.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.231
JASON:
That's her.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.804
Huh.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.248
Not what I expected.

39:12.610 --> 39:15.078
I don't believe this.

39:15.130 --> 39:17.086
The only way
to get you off

39:17.130 --> 39:20.782
is to show this video
to the judge.

39:20.830 --> 39:23.139
And she gets hauled
into court?

39:25.140 --> 39:29.099
And that judge calls her number
in front of all those people.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.882
Yes.

39:31.930 --> 39:34.103
[long sigh]

39:35.720 --> 39:38.280
I'll take the plea.

39:48.340 --> 39:52.117
What's next?Just closing statements
and crossing of fingers.

39:52.170 --> 39:55.515
I trust in good arguments,
not magical happenings.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.994
What?Why is he back here?

40:01.920 --> 40:04.343
CANNING:
Did your wife
have an account

40:04.400 --> 40:06.391
on the Web site
Scabbit?Yes.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.660
Can you see
that okay?

40:11.710 --> 40:15.350
Let's look at this posting
she made May 12.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.139
Can you read that?

40:17.190 --> 40:18.748
STOKE:
"Garbage."

40:18.800 --> 40:20.939
"Garbage"
with an exclamation point.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.936
Now let's just scroll up and see

40:22.980 --> 40:24.971
what thread
she was responding to.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.669
Now, you see that?

40:28.730 --> 40:30.243
Can you read that?

40:30.290 --> 40:32.758
STOKE: "Duke University
Brain Tumor Center offers hope

40:32.820 --> 40:35.072
for polio cure."So Alexa didknow

40:35.120 --> 40:38.123
about the potential treatment
and still made the decision

40:38.170 --> 40:40.775
that the slim chance of success
wasn't worth it.

40:43.390 --> 40:45.176
[door bangs into desk]

40:45.220 --> 40:46.528
Ruth. Come in.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.004
Oh. I don't want
to interrupt you, Eli.

40:49.050 --> 40:51.132
I just wanted to say thank you.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.569
I know you were trying
to make my life hell

40:53.620 --> 40:56.316
by siccing all
those Florricks on me.
But you know what?

40:56.360 --> 40:58.316
We worked through it.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.318
And it wound up bringing me a
lot closer to Jackie and Grace.

41:01.370 --> 41:03.452
So thank you.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.451
And just remember...

41:07.500 --> 41:09.456
I'm good at what I do.

41:09.510 --> 41:12.286
You want to get me,

41:12.330 --> 41:15.072
you'll have to bring
your "A" game.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.245
Open or closed?

41:19.300 --> 41:21.256
Or I guess it doesn't matter.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.818
It's really not as
bad as you think.

41:30.870 --> 41:34.089
You came in second in
perps by the pound.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.654
All the bar attorneys think
I'm a slimy bitch

41:36.710 --> 41:38.666
who poached their clients.

41:38.710 --> 41:40.439
Who cares
about them?

41:40.490 --> 41:42.833
I also gave up
a possible class action suit

41:42.890 --> 41:45.233
for some video footage
I couldn't use.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.010
[sighs] The way I see it,
you have two problems.

41:48.070 --> 41:51.619
One-- you spend too much
time on your cases.

41:51.680 --> 41:55.150
Which is why you'll always be
a disaster in bond court.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.246
[laughs]

41:56.290 --> 41:58.724
And two...

41:58.770 --> 42:00.328
Nope.

42:00.380 --> 42:01.859
One problem.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.946
What were you gonna say?

42:03.990 --> 42:07.118
No. You'll wear it
as a badge of honor.

42:07.170 --> 42:09.638
Oh, come on.
Now you have to say.

42:11.390 --> 42:13.346
You care too much.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.209
There.

42:15.270 --> 42:17.568
How's that? Happy?

42:17.620 --> 42:20.259
Not really.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.790
There's no glory in
this slog, Alicia.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.536
Shake the trees for
better-paying cases.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.937
What?

42:37.990 --> 42:39.412
Want to do it together?

42:39.460 --> 42:41.416
