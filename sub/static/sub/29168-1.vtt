00:00.935 --> 00:03.002
(silence)

00:14.715 --> 00:17.783
(suspenseful music)

00:18.753 --> 00:21.553
(woman sniffing)

00:29.530 --> 00:32.998
(bar patrons chattering)

00:35.469 --> 00:38.637
(soft ominous music)

01:09.703 --> 01:13.272
(sultry electronic music)

01:44.472 --> 01:45.704
- [Angela] So?

01:48.142 --> 01:50.042
You like what you see?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.413
- (sighs) Very much so.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.850
- [Angela] Good.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.822
You see.
- Frank.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.023
Frank.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.425
- [Angela] I like real men.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.527
- (snaps) Damn it, listen!

02:08.529 --> 02:10.028
- I'm listening.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.599
(sultry electronic music)

03:02.082 --> 03:03.482
- [Angela] Yes.

03:04.919 --> 03:05.817
- Frank.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.686
Frank.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.790
(snaps) Damn it, listen!

03:11.792 --> 03:13.492
- I'm listening.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.793
- Yeah.

03:14.795 --> 03:19.164
- There are too many people
who have claimed to see spirits

03:19.166 --> 03:20.999
for it all to be a fantasy.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.070
Either they're crazy,
or they're lying,

03:25.072 --> 03:28.340
or there's gotta be
some truth to it.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.341
(hand smacks)

03:29.343 --> 03:30.576
- This right here?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.244
(hand pounding)

03:32.246 --> 03:33.912
This I can believe in.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.549
All right, if I can't see it
or touch it,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.319
kinda makes it hard
to believe in.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.920
I don't have blind faith.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.523
- That's understandable.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.058
Most people think the
way you do.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.460
- And most people have
sense, which you lack.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.763
- I'm just tryin' to
plant a seed

03:51.765 --> 03:54.132
of possibility in your mind,

03:54.134 --> 03:57.135
just an iota of possibility.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.304
- And?

03:59.306 --> 04:01.373
- And that resurrection
is a fact.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.275
- That's it, next subject,
come on.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.610
- [Chuy] Christ, man.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.877
Well then there's some
truth to it.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.814
We could just argue about this
all night.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.915
- You son of a bitch.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.049
- What?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.951
- Wait, you wanna go out
and fuck her right now?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.087
Go ahead, I saw the way
you were lookin' at her.

04:15.089 --> 04:15.954
- What look?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.923
- If I wasn't here you'd
be out back

04:17.925 --> 04:19.258
fuckin' her by the trash.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.292
Wouldn't you? Admit it.
- Why the fuck

04:20.294 --> 04:21.126
do you gotta be a wench right
now, huh?

04:21.128 --> 04:22.294
- You fuckin' make me sick.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.228
- Hey!

04:23.230 --> 04:25.664
Not here, not again.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.500
- I'm gonna run to the
ladies room, boys, play nice.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.635
Whiskey?

04:29.637 --> 04:30.669
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.737
- All right.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.708
- She never gives up.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.976
- Hey, cutie.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.480
(bar patrons chattering)

04:43.317 --> 04:46.084
- I said stop!
- Excuse me.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.653
What do you think you're
doin' with my husband?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.388
(head thuds)
(Janie groans)

04:49.390 --> 04:50.222
- You bitch!

04:50.224 --> 04:52.991
(women grunting)

04:52.993 --> 04:54.092
(glass breaking)

04:54.094 --> 04:55.694
- I'll kill you,
you little whore.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.797
You know what, Chuy, fuck you!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.365
- Oh, come on.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.433
Seriously, Janie?

05:02.536 --> 05:04.569
- Yeah, seriously.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.306
- I'm out.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.474
- Life could be worse, Frankie.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.375
- Hey.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.383
I just needed some salt.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.618
(suspenseful music)

05:19.620 --> 05:21.019
- Come on, yeah, so what?
(camera beeps)

05:21.021 --> 05:22.070
She's good lookin'

05:22.071 --> 05:23.120
but she's not for me.
(camera clicking)

05:23.123 --> 05:24.489
You know what?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.856
This conversation is never
gonna work itself out.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.858
Understand, honey?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.461
(camera clicking)
- Oh.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.963
Fucking overloaded.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.131
Hey babe?
- Yeah?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.501
- How can you see in the dark?

05:36.503 --> 05:39.071
- How can you crawl up my ass in
the dark?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.275
- How many times do I have to
remind you

05:43.277 --> 05:45.777
to empty your fucking pockets?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.513
- I don't know, maybe
five or six?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.348
Maybe you'll get it at 10.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.417
- Yeah, oh, 10.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.219
What about this, huh?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.921
- Oh, my wallet.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.524
And you didn't take
anything out of it.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.093
I'm proud of you.
- No, I didn't, fucker.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.427
And next time I'll put it
in the wash.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.495
- Yeah, go for it.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.431
Hey, hey!

06:06.433 --> 06:08.533
Would you relax, please?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.702
Just go take a bath,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.904
take a really long hot bath.
- Oh yeah, sounds great.

06:12.906 --> 06:13.839
- Good.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.140
- Yeah, so what?

06:15.141 --> 06:16.440
She's good looking, but she's
not for me.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.443
You know what, this conversation

06:18.445 --> 06:20.011
is never gonna work itself out.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.346
If I tell you
I'm not interested,

06:21.348 --> 06:22.814
you call me a fuckin'
liar, and if I tell you

06:22.816 --> 06:24.983
I do wanna fuck her, you say,
I knew it.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.753
Baby, there's only room
in my heart for you.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.587
This is pointless.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.472
All right, just drop it.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.356
- Admit it, you just want a
hot slut to stick your dick in.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.659
- Whatever, wouldn't be the
first time.

06:34.661 --> 06:35.994
- [Janie] Excuse me?

06:36.964 --> 06:37.863
- You heard me.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.567
(suspenseful music)

06:42.569 --> 06:43.735
- [Janie] Now I'm gonna
hurt you.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.103
- Put the knife down, Janie.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.071
- [Janie] I'm only kidding.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.206
- [Frank] Yeah, right.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.340
I said put it down.
- I said I was only.

06:48.342 --> 06:49.174
- Janie.
- I was only--

06:49.176 --> 06:50.575
- Put it down now.
- Let go of me

06:50.577 --> 06:52.177
so I can put it down.
- I said put it down!

06:52.179 --> 06:53.745
- What the fuck?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.080
What's he doin'?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.048
(suspenseful music)

06:57.050 --> 06:59.217
(camera clicking)

06:59.219 --> 07:00.285
- Let go of me so I can

07:00.287 --> 07:01.553
put it down.
- I said put it down!

07:01.554 --> 07:02.820
- Let go of me.
- Janie, put the knife down.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.289
- Let go of me so I can.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.190
- Put it down I said put it

07:05.192 --> 07:06.191
down now.
- Frank.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.426
- Janie.
- Let go.

07:07.428 --> 07:10.328
(ominous music)

07:10.330 --> 07:13.231
(insects buzzing)

07:19.239 --> 07:21.907
(wind hissing)

07:23.977 --> 07:26.611
(somber music)

07:54.408 --> 07:56.975
(eerie music)

08:00.514 --> 08:04.149
(Janie breathing raggedly)

08:10.724 --> 08:13.892
(soft ominous music)

08:41.455 --> 08:44.189
(phone ringing)

08:47.528 --> 08:49.661
(clears throat) Hello?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.263
- Hey, Janie, it's Chuy.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.264
Is Frank there?

08:53.767 --> 08:54.766
- Yeah.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.518
- God damn it.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.269
He knows we have a big
shipment coming in today.

08:59.339 --> 09:03.041
- Yeah, he has a hangover.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.209
He's not feeling well.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.878
He has a really bad one.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.481
He's not gonna come in today.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.483
- You gotta get his ass in gear!

09:11.485 --> 09:13.652
Give him a water, an aspirin,

09:13.654 --> 09:15.954
or a shot of whiskey
for all I give a fuck!

09:15.956 --> 09:16.855
- Okay.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.324
- [Chuy] Just tell him to hurry!

09:20.127 --> 09:21.693
- Okay, bye.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.530
(phone bangs)

09:25.532 --> 09:27.065
- Frank still comin' in?

09:27.067 --> 09:27.966
- Yeah.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.636
- Ain't the same without
Frank here.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.938
- I know, Eddie!

09:32.940 --> 09:34.205
(cleaver bangs)

09:34.207 --> 09:35.757
Fuck!

09:35.758 --> 09:37.308
- I know that's your gravy
in the bathroom, fucker.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.910
- Just keep moppin', man!

09:38.912 --> 09:42.948
(speaking in foreign language)

09:42.950 --> 09:45.850
(buttons beeping)

09:47.254 --> 09:50.322
(telephone ringing)

09:55.095 --> 09:56.828
- Hello, Hair and Powder
Beauty Salon.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.063
(speaking in foreign language)

09:58.065 --> 10:00.432
- Hola, Ramona, it's Janie.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.667
(speaking in foreign language)
I can't make it in today.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.769
(speaking in foreign language)

10:04.771 --> 10:06.571
Can you cover for me?

10:06.573 --> 10:10.575
(speaking in foreign language)

10:12.646 --> 10:13.878
Cover one of my shifts
and I'll cover

10:13.880 --> 10:15.146
two of yours, por favor.

10:16.416 --> 10:20.418
(speaking in foreign language)

10:27.027 --> 10:28.360
(speaking in foreign language)
I'll cover

10:28.362 --> 10:29.427
four of your shifts.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.332
- No, no. (speaking in foreign
language).

10:36.069 --> 10:38.703
(speaking in foreign language)

10:38.705 --> 10:40.305
- Do this favor for me, please?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.441
- Okay, okay, (speaking
in foreign language).

10:43.443 --> 10:48.513
Okay. (speaking in foreign
language)

10:49.082 --> 10:51.683
Okay?
(phone beeps)

10:54.655 --> 10:57.389
(cleaver bangs)

10:58.458 --> 11:01.559
- It's gonna take me all
day, that lazy piece of shit.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.695
- (scoffs) I was gonna say.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.196
It's kinda late to still
be at home.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.264
- Yeah, I know, man.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.933
Can you start on one
of those for me?

11:08.935 --> 11:09.834
You remember how?

11:12.673 --> 11:13.805
- Sure.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.706
- Okay man.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.841
And all the ones that
I fucked up,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.176
you can take 'em
home if you want.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.044
(Eddie chuckles)

11:19.046 --> 11:19.944
All right.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.681
I'm sorry that I yelled before.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.685
Can you watch the shop for a
little bit?

11:26.687 --> 11:27.719
- Whatever you say.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.088
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.322
Put on a hairnet, okay?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.425
- Really?

11:33.427 --> 11:34.859
Okay, okay, yeah.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.760
- Thanks.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.133
- [Eddie] Aw man, I ain't, oh!

11:42.135 --> 11:43.768
Man, I ain't eatin' that shit!

11:53.914 --> 11:57.482
(suspenseful piano music)

11:58.952 --> 12:01.753
(doorbell rings)

12:08.128 --> 12:10.962
(doorbell rings)

12:13.867 --> 12:16.835
- [Chuy] Mornin', Janie, is
Frank here?

12:16.837 --> 12:17.736
- Uh...

12:18.905 --> 12:19.971
- Frank!

12:19.973 --> 12:20.905
You here?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.173
- [Janie] He's not here.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.911
- What the hell is that?

12:28.648 --> 12:31.483
- It's why we had an argument
last night.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.518
- Where the hell is he?

12:35.155 --> 12:37.122
- I don't know.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.957
He just took off.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.025
- (scoffs) Just like Frank.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.361
Finds the perfect time
to pull this bullshit.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.564
- Yeah, I know.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.199
He's got that fighting nature.

12:49.970 --> 12:50.869
- God damn it!

12:52.873 --> 12:54.305
Got any idea where he went?

12:55.675 --> 12:58.743
- [Janie] No idea, maybe he's
at that bitch Angela's house.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.979
- I seriously doubt that.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.884
- I don't think he's gonna
be coming back for a while.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.218
- Why would you say that?

13:09.055 --> 13:10.955
- It's just not like him
to run off.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.393
If you see him, tell him
to come home.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.532
Tell him I'm sorry and
I just want him back.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.301
- Of course, yeah.

13:27.974 --> 13:28.873
You all right?

13:29.709 --> 13:30.608
- Sorry.

13:31.912 --> 13:32.977
- You need anything?

13:34.981 --> 13:35.880
- Just drained.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.651
One too many fights, that's all.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.286
- Yeah, no, I understand.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.388
Look, if you see him first,

13:43.390 --> 13:46.090
just send him over
to the meat market.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.426
That's where I'll be at,
all right?

13:48.428 --> 13:51.796
So if you need anything, just
call down there, all right?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.865
- Okay, okay.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.633
- Get some rest, Janie.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.534
- Thanks.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.777
(suspenseful music)

14:15.388 --> 14:18.890
- Then I said, you just better
boogie on

14:18.892 --> 14:19.791
out of here.
- Say, Ned.

14:19.793 --> 14:20.992
How's it goin'?

14:20.994 --> 14:26.064
- Hey, I was just tellin'
Ned here about the time

14:28.235 --> 14:31.169
I caught my wife cheatin' on
me (chuckles) with a jockey.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.906
Little motherfucker he was.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.307
- What can I get you, Chuy?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.575
- Nothin'.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.676
Have you seen Frank?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.546
- Last time I saw him
was with you.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.348
Everything good?

14:43.350 --> 14:47.285
- It's fine, I just, I
thought he'd be here.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.821
(bluesy electric guitar music)

14:49.823 --> 14:51.322
- Hey.

14:51.324 --> 14:56.394
Sit your fat ass down and
have a drink with us, on me.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.965
- It's a little early for
me, I'ma take a rain check.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.135
(suspenseful music)

15:48.214 --> 15:51.015
(doorbell rings)

15:57.490 --> 15:59.023
- Good evening.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.859
I thought we could have
a drink together.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.861
- (chuckles) What?

16:03.863 --> 16:04.729
Shouldn't she be at home?

16:04.731 --> 16:05.630
- I don't wanna be at home.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.998
I'm not a fuckin' child.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.135
Let's have a drink.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.472
- And talk about what?

16:14.474 --> 16:18.543
- Well, I'd really rather
not say it out loud.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.981
- Well give it your
best whisper then.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.782
- I know about Frank.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.553
(ominous music)

16:29.556 --> 16:30.989
- Now's not really a good time.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.790
- Yeah, well, now's a
good time for me.

16:32.792 --> 16:37.295
(door bangs)
(Janie scoffs)

16:37.297 --> 16:39.230
I'll fix that for ya,
free of charge.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.567
So, invite me in.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.307
- Sit.
- What am I, your fuckin' dog?

16:49.309 --> 16:52.443
(suspenseful music)

16:58.585 --> 16:59.617
- What do you want?

16:59.619 --> 17:02.453
- I was watching last night.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.656
- What about last night?

17:05.658 --> 17:08.626
- It was a night of murder.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.927
(Dirk laughs)

17:09.929 --> 17:11.429
- Of murder?
- Yeah.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.064
- What the fuck do you
know about anything?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.465
- Lady, I don't have
time for fucking games.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.034
- The name's not lady, fuck you.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.803
- Ooh, why so testy, Miss?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.806
The name is Dirk, and it's a
pleasure to formally meet you.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.612
Oh shit, he's still here?

17:27.614 --> 17:28.663
Fuck!

17:28.664 --> 17:29.713
I'm sorry man, it's
not what it looks like.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.550
(Janie laughing)

17:39.626 --> 17:42.093
(fingers snapping)

17:42.095 --> 17:43.227
He's still here?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.262
- [Janie] What, are you worried?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.264
- That is fuckin' disgusting!

17:46.266 --> 17:47.765
- [Janie] What's it to you?

17:47.767 --> 17:50.001
- That's revolting,
that's fucking ghastly!

17:52.338 --> 17:53.337
Goddamn.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.040
Guess that's why it
stinks in here.

17:57.043 --> 17:57.942
- I know.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.215
- (chuckles) Tell ya the truth,

18:04.217 --> 18:06.818
I don't really give a shit that
he's dead,

18:06.820 --> 18:11.889
but I am gonna need something
in return for keeping quiet.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.393
- Well that's not very nice.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.461
(suspenseful music)

18:16.463 --> 18:19.864
- Well, I'm not a very nice guy.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.666
Ask my wife.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.335
- So what do you want?

18:31.945 --> 18:33.277
- A little bit,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.215
here and there.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.249
- A little what?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.384
- Let's not put it
into words now.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.254
- Why should I, hm?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.891
(Dirk chuckles)

18:48.962 --> 18:49.861
Hm?

18:52.665 --> 18:53.498
- Hm?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.234
(ominous music)

18:59.939 --> 19:04.142
That is not the only set.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.111
So if I die, the cops will
know where to find 'em.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.520
- So when, now?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.856
- Sure, all right.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.424
He can watch.
- No.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.361
No, not now.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.497
You need to let me think about.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.799
Just let me think about it.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.602
- Don't you take
too fuckin' long!

19:33.740 --> 19:36.908
(Dirk smacks a kiss)

19:39.279 --> 19:41.846
(door clicks)

19:44.284 --> 19:47.351
(suspenseful music)

19:57.063 --> 19:59.797
(phone ringing)

20:00.833 --> 20:02.300
- Mornin', Janie.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.835
- Have you heard from Frank?

20:04.837 --> 20:07.505
- No, what about you?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.473
- I'm startin' to get worried.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.108
- You think he went somewhere?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.978
- [Janie] I don't know, your
guess is as good as mine.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.214
- [Chuy] Maybe we should call
the police.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.516
- Well he hasn't been
missing for 48 hours yet.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.051
- Aren't you worried?

20:20.053 --> 20:21.852
Don't you want to find him?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.654
- I do, but why would we
make it public?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.456
I mean, what if he comes
back tomorrow night?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.158
We don't know.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.993
- At least check, you could
go ask

20:28.995 --> 20:31.128
a few places, I don't know.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.064
- Well suppose he
comes back after,

20:33.066 --> 20:35.833
after we let everyone know
that he's been missing?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.101
Everybody would go nuts.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.470
- I guess so.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.539
We'll wait.

20:41.541 --> 20:46.277
Okay, I'm runnin' late,
so I'll see ya later.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.511
- Okay, all right, bye.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.954
(chimes twinkling)

21:01.561 --> 21:04.128
- [Rodrigo] Ah, Chuy.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.131
What do you want to know now?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.800
- My brother, he's missing.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.872
His wife said they had a
fight and he just took off.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.478
That was yesterday morning,
and now I need your help.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.115
- Oh, okay.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.184
(suspenseful music)

21:35.194 --> 21:36.093
Okay.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.266
Picture your brother.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.905
Can you see him?

21:49.509 --> 21:50.408
- Yes.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.980
- The deck, cut the deck.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.400
(Rodrigo grunts)

22:16.402 --> 22:17.501
- What?

22:17.503 --> 22:22.573
- Sh, sh, sh.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.609
Ah.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.744
- What is it?

22:27.680 --> 22:31.716
- The cards don't
say he's missing.

22:34.087 --> 22:37.588
- Rodrigo, where is he?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.489
- Wait.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.627
Ah.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.628
- What?
- Wait.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.435
And don't be so uptight.

22:55.308 --> 22:59.910
Ah, it's all starting
to come together.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.147
- And?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.316
- It's the card,

23:11.524 --> 23:12.757
the card of...

23:13.993 --> 23:15.593
- The card of what?

23:15.595 --> 23:16.494
Tell me.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.897
Why the hell did I come here?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.532
Help me.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.600
- Calm down.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.106
Let's finish.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.413
- Fine.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.817
(chimes twinkling)

23:39.819 --> 23:42.887
(suspenseful music)

24:58.631 --> 25:01.432
(men chattering)

25:05.938 --> 25:08.672
(fist pounding)

25:11.811 --> 25:16.881
- I have a feeling this must
be the woman in question.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.619
- I'm Janie.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.821
- Yes, come on in.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.056
Sit down.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.461
(ominous music)

25:33.032 --> 25:36.600
I was in the middle of
a reading for Chuy.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.840
- I have something to tell you.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.844
Something important and I
really hope you believe me.

25:47.947 --> 25:48.846
- Well say it.

25:51.250 --> 25:55.052
(dramatic suspenseful music)

26:09.335 --> 26:10.534
- It can't be possible.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.270
- What else is there, murderer?

26:14.574 --> 26:16.941
- Stop, you already know
this is enough for me.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.144
- Rodrigo's told me things.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.512
(ominous music)

26:21.514 --> 26:22.479
- You wish.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.684
(Chuy wheezing)

26:27.920 --> 26:32.990
You will not remember, Chuy.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.028
- Aztec rituals.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.230
There's a book.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.434
So, who's to say?

26:50.776 --> 26:54.345
- Pick us up at 11, and
take care of my car.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.646
- I'll be here.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.089
(suspenseful music)

27:25.011 --> 27:27.244
- We'll grow old together.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.690
It's time to go, Frank.

27:49.035 --> 27:52.036
(Rodrigo chanting)

27:54.874 --> 27:57.574
- [Izel] What are you doing
sitting here in the dark again?

27:57.576 --> 27:58.475
- Shh!

28:03.382 --> 28:04.548
- What is it?

28:04.550 --> 28:05.849
- I don't know.

28:07.553 --> 28:08.919
- What's he doing?

28:08.921 --> 28:11.055
(Rodrigo chanting)
- Beats me.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.623
Maybe they're, like, Satanists.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.825
- It's probably just a prowler.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.194
I don't think there are any
Satanists here in these parts.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.095
And they're not evil.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.530
- What, are you fuckin' stupid?

28:19.532 --> 28:21.131
Of course Satanists are evil.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.299
That's why they're Satanists.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.717
- Then call the fuckin' police.

28:23.718 --> 28:25.134
- No, don't call the police,
okay?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.937
I wanna see what's goin' on.

28:28.107 --> 28:33.177
(Rodrigo chanting)
(playful suspenseful music)

28:42.288 --> 28:43.954
- Ya know, you shouldn't
snack after dinner.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.590
You know you don't sleep
good on a full belly.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.561
I'm gonna take a bath.

28:52.965 --> 28:53.964
See ya in bed?

28:55.501 --> 28:56.800
Hm?
- Hm?

28:56.802 --> 28:58.168
- See you in bed?

28:58.170 --> 29:01.105
- Oh, yeah, yeah, after
I finish my sandwich.

29:01.107 --> 29:04.074
You fuckin' psycho bitch.
(sighs)

29:07.646 --> 29:12.716
(Rodrigo chanting)
(playful suspenseful music)

29:43.415 --> 29:45.215
Who the fuck are you?

29:46.452 --> 29:49.419
(Rodrigo chanting)

29:54.059 --> 29:57.027
(chimes twinkling)

30:02.134 --> 30:05.202
(suspenseful music)

30:15.881 --> 30:18.782
(camera clicking)

31:27.720 --> 31:32.789
(crickets chirping)
(wind howling)

31:46.705 --> 31:49.606
(animals howling)

31:53.512 --> 31:56.146
(wind howling)

32:00.853 --> 32:04.588
- Janie.
(Janie screaming)

32:04.590 --> 32:05.455
- Janie, Janie!

32:05.457 --> 32:06.423
Are you all right?

32:07.826 --> 32:09.493
- Don't be alarmed.

32:17.069 --> 32:17.968
- Should I?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.707
- No, no, I want to.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.747
(somber music)

32:55.741 --> 32:58.976
- I don't understand why
she did this.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.612
Why didn't she try the chemo?

33:02.614 --> 33:03.680
- She couldn't have.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.084
Look, she ended it her way.

33:07.886 --> 33:08.919
All right, come on.

33:09.922 --> 33:11.355
- And the closed casket?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.624
We didn't even get to say
goodbye to her.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.027
- At least we know she's
not suffering anymore.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.998
- Come on, be strong,
little brother.

33:22.568 --> 33:23.867
She made a choice.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.836
Everything's about choices.

33:25.838 --> 33:29.239
Yeah, hers may hurt us, but
it was still hers to make.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.376
Come on.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.449
(Chuy crying)

33:39.451 --> 33:42.085
(somber music)

34:04.643 --> 34:09.279
(Rodrigo chanting in foreign
language)

34:22.094 --> 34:27.130
- Now we have to leave
it up to Mother Nature.

34:31.003 --> 34:35.539
I have done what I can do.

34:36.542 --> 34:40.110
Now all we can do is wait.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.417
- Yes.

34:48.987 --> 34:49.886
Let's go.

34:51.023 --> 34:51.922
Yeah.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.733
- Oh, you're amazing.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.203
Impressive.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.104
I love that.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.339
Mm-hm.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.741
(chuckles) Mm-hm.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.812
Okay, I'll see you soon.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.414
Soon, yes.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.124
What are you always doing
by the window?

35:27.126 --> 35:29.025
- What does it look
like I'm doin'?

35:29.027 --> 35:30.127
Nothin'.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.628
- Nothing.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.563
See anything interesting out
there today?

35:33.565 --> 35:36.233
- No, no, on my days off
I like to relax.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.235
- Mm, take a long, hot bath.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.870
- Yeah, I'll do that.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.106
- Well, have fun.

35:43.108 --> 35:45.275
I'm off to the salon.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.176
- Bye.

35:46.979 --> 35:47.878
- Bye.

35:49.615 --> 35:53.517
Bye. (chuckles)

35:53.519 --> 35:56.019
(door slams)

37:08.760 --> 37:11.728
- Not in the fuckin' kitchen.
(suspenseful music)

37:11.730 --> 37:13.964
Not in the stupid kitchen.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.700
Look at the flowers.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.268
Yeah, whatever.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.137
It didn't fuckin' matter to me.

37:21.139 --> 37:22.939
What do ya got?

37:22.941 --> 37:26.276
Ah, ya cheap fuckin' bastard.

37:27.613 --> 37:30.013
Maybe she killed ya 'cause
ya buy such shit beer.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.982
(can pops)

37:31.984 --> 37:32.882
Huh.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.987
Ah, cleaned up that bastard
pretty good, didn't they?

37:38.223 --> 37:41.524
Fuckin' dead bastard. (chuckles)

37:43.495 --> 37:45.962
(groans) Fuck.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.999
(suspenseful music)

38:17.796 --> 38:20.363
(Dirk grunts)

38:25.904 --> 38:26.803
Bitch.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.874
You ready to think
about my proposal?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.509
Just give it to me.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.419
- Hey, Eddie.

39:16.421 --> 39:17.454
- Hold on, hold on.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.257
- We're gonna shut down
early today, all right?

39:21.259 --> 39:23.293
You can go, I'll close
everything down.

39:24.429 --> 39:25.995
- All right, thanks.

39:25.997 --> 39:26.896
- No worries.

39:34.973 --> 39:35.956
Take care.

39:35.957 --> 39:36.940
- You, too,
I'll see ya tomorrow.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.007
- All right.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.883
(Chuy sighs)

39:46.885 --> 39:48.985
This place is a fuckin' mess.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.188
- Hey, Chuy.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.758
- What's up, man?
- Can I ask you somethin'?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.209
- [Chuy] Yeah.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.659
- Ya know, I've been workin'
here for a couple years now,

39:57.662 --> 40:00.930
and Frank's never missed
a day of work.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.265
You'd tell me if there
was something

40:02.267 --> 40:04.267
really wrong, wouldn't you?

40:04.269 --> 40:06.002
- Course, man, yeah.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.505
It's just the flu, so
don't worry about it.

40:08.507 --> 40:09.906
He'll be fine.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.208
- (chuckles) Right.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.144
Can ya tell him I said
to get better?

40:14.146 --> 40:15.478
- Will do, man.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.312
- All right, man.

40:16.314 --> 40:17.547
Hey, that shit was real today.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.549
- I know it.
- Even without Frank.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.284
- (chuckles) See ya tomorrow.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.119
- Gon' take a lime.

40:23.922 --> 40:24.921
- All right, Eddie.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.492
Oh shit.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.360
There we go.

40:30.362 --> 40:31.795
(ominous music)

40:31.797 --> 40:35.965
(sighs) Where the fuck
did I put my lighter?

40:39.304 --> 40:42.505
(bell dings)

40:42.507 --> 40:45.208
Sorry, man, we're closed
for the day.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.626
- Closed?
- Yeah.

40:46.627 --> 40:48.043
- I mean, it's a little
early for that, right?

40:48.046 --> 40:48.945
It's only four.

40:49.915 --> 40:53.883
- All right, you're my last,
then.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.285
- You'll like my business.

40:57.422 --> 40:58.588
- You're Frank's neighbor,
right?

40:58.590 --> 40:59.489
- Yeah.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.858
That's me.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.993
Hey man, I quit those
motherfuckers three weeks ago.

41:03.995 --> 41:08.531
Ever since I've been mean,
mean, mean. (chuckles)

41:09.835 --> 41:12.135
- So, what'll it be, man?

41:16.208 --> 41:19.108
- 10 pounds of sirloin, 10
pounds of boneless ribeye,

41:19.945 --> 41:25.014
10 pounds of your finest
venison, and (clears throat)

41:25.984 --> 41:27.917
what the fuck do they call
rabbit meat?

41:27.919 --> 41:31.087
(chuckles) Well, 10 pounds of
that, and I want it for free.

41:32.557 --> 41:33.823
- Excuse me?

41:33.825 --> 41:35.124
- Yeah.
(ominous music)

41:35.126 --> 41:40.296
I said, you'll give it to
me for free.

41:40.298 --> 41:41.498
- You fuck.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.066
- Yeah.

41:43.068 --> 41:47.570
Free meat, for quite some
time, and I'll stay quiet.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.405
- Who the hell do you
think you are?

41:49.407 --> 41:52.141
- Cops might like to know about
a certain missing citizen,

41:52.143 --> 41:53.443
asshole that he may be.

41:54.579 --> 41:58.381
But don't worry, the meat,
it's enough.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.183
You know, it's not like
you killed someone, right?

42:00.185 --> 42:02.085
But the one thing I
can't figure out

42:02.087 --> 42:05.655
is why are you closing early?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.257
I mean, it's gotta be pretty
hard running the business

42:07.259 --> 42:08.391
without your faggot
brother running around.

42:08.393 --> 42:09.259
- You fuckin' piece

42:09.261 --> 42:10.460
of shit.
- I wouldn't.

42:10.462 --> 42:11.327
I wouldn't.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.396
(suspenseful music)

42:13.398 --> 42:14.664
Murder doesn't suit you.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.934
(cleaver thuds)

42:17.936 --> 42:19.936
Okay good, good.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.170
This is good.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.423
(ominous music)

42:23.424 --> 42:25.675
So we'll meet tomorrow and
I can pick up my package.

42:26.611 --> 42:27.810
What do ya say?

42:27.812 --> 42:29.712
Here, six o'clock?

42:29.714 --> 42:31.414
Or should I just meet you
at the widow's?

42:32.350 --> 42:35.418
- Hold on, I got somethin'
to wet your beak.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.321
(suspenseful music)

42:38.323 --> 42:39.455
- Oh.

42:39.457 --> 42:41.824
(chuckles) Fuck.

42:41.826 --> 42:42.725
- It's fresh.

42:43.862 --> 42:44.827
- I like you, man.

42:45.797 --> 42:46.829
I like you a lot.

42:46.831 --> 42:48.698
- Get the fuck outta my shop.

42:50.735 --> 42:51.634
Fuck!

42:52.904 --> 42:54.971
You said you'd resurrect him.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.105
You lied to me.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.307
This is bullshit.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.577
- Watch your tone with me.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.478
I did my best.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.914
It was my first time.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.683
- Well figure it out.
(suspenseful music)

43:06.685 --> 43:08.785
You knew that Janie
killed my brother.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.520
That wasn't a wild
fuckin' guess.

43:10.522 --> 43:14.657
- The cards are a very minor,
minor skill

43:14.659 --> 43:16.426
compared to this.

43:16.428 --> 43:19.362
You should be glad I failed.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.364
I never should have tried.

43:21.366 --> 43:23.032
- Well you're gonna try again,

43:23.835 --> 43:25.635
and you're gonna
try your damnedest.

43:26.538 --> 43:31.574
- My wife said the book
works, so that means it works.

43:31.910 --> 43:36.446
It can be done,
and just not by me.

43:36.448 --> 43:40.316
- I paid you, so you're
gonna do it.

43:40.318 --> 43:44.220
Learn it again, make it work.

43:44.222 --> 43:48.891
- You're foolish,
so, so foolish.

44:15.453 --> 44:18.187
(ominous music)

44:51.489 --> 44:54.057
(Janie sighs)

44:55.193 --> 44:58.261
(suspenseful music)

language)

45:40.672 --> 45:45.742
(ominous music)
(Rodrigo chanting)

46:27.585 --> 46:28.918
- What's wrong?

46:29.988 --> 46:30.887
- Shh.

46:33.758 --> 46:36.726
(Rodrigo chanting)

46:45.436 --> 46:48.171
(Rodrigo gasps)

47:00.084 --> 47:02.819
(ominous music)

47:24.709 --> 47:25.708
- My darling.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.913
Geez, just wanted to
surprise you.

47:37.222 --> 47:38.120
Frank.

47:40.792 --> 47:42.191
Frank, you look real sick.

47:53.938 --> 47:56.072
Frank.

47:56.074 --> 47:56.906
Frank.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.642
(ominous music)

48:14.926 --> 48:17.760
Maybe it's just stress.

48:17.762 --> 48:21.297
You've been going through
so much stress lately.

48:23.701 --> 48:25.935
This can cause cancer,
you understand that?

48:27.672 --> 48:29.939
And can get you old real quick.

48:29.941 --> 48:31.540
- Quit your yappin' bullshit.

48:38.716 --> 48:41.350
(Angela sighs)

48:43.421 --> 48:44.453
- Oh my God.

48:50.862 --> 48:53.763
(sighs) Touch me.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.002
¶ Used to be ¶

49:00.004 --> 49:00.836
- Frank.

49:00.838 --> 49:03.072
¶ A dancing queen ¶

49:03.074 --> 49:04.173
¶ Now it seems ¶

49:04.175 --> 49:05.308
- Look at me.

49:06.511 --> 49:07.743
Look at me!

49:07.745 --> 49:12.548
¶ They say ¶

49:12.550 --> 49:17.053
¶ She's likes to listen
to her heart ¶

49:17.055 --> 49:19.989
¶ But she knows she is ¶

49:19.991 --> 49:21.891
- [Angela] Okay.

49:21.893 --> 49:23.192
Do you want me?

49:24.996 --> 49:25.895
Come on.

49:28.066 --> 49:28.965
Come on.

49:28.967 --> 49:31.367
Come on, pull my panties off.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.369
Come on, take them off.

49:34.539 --> 49:37.373
(couple sighing)

49:39.811 --> 49:41.410
Come on, let me see it.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.245
Let me see it.

49:43.247 --> 49:44.513
Oh,

49:44.515 --> 49:46.015
oh, come on.

49:46.017 --> 49:48.084
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

49:48.086 --> 49:49.618
- [Angela] Come on, you want it.

49:49.620 --> 49:50.553
- No, I just don't.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.621
- Come on, come on.
- No.

49:55.093 --> 49:55.992
I'm sorry.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.395
I can't do this.

50:03.468 --> 50:04.367
Fuck.

50:08.139 --> 50:11.574
¶ If the sun refused to shine ¶

50:11.576 --> 50:14.310
(ominous music)

50:17.982 --> 50:19.815
- I'm leaving with you, Frank.

50:21.219 --> 50:22.284
You hear me?

50:23.888 --> 50:25.688
I'm leaving with you.

50:39.704 --> 50:42.104
Frank, I'm leaving with you.

50:45.610 --> 50:46.675
You hear me?

50:50.048 --> 50:52.615
(Frank spits)

50:58.556 --> 51:01.123
- [Frank] You sure you
can handle a man like me?

51:09.767 --> 51:12.501
- [Angela] I'll make you scream.

51:14.505 --> 51:16.605
I'll make you scream.

51:16.607 --> 51:19.675
(suspenseful music)

51:30.421 --> 51:33.722
(soft acoustic guitar music)

51:33.724 --> 51:38.794
¶ How many days have I
been under this sun ¶

51:39.063 --> 51:44.133
¶ Holdin' onto life, I need to
hold on ¶

51:44.702 --> 51:47.269
¶ Now I have you ¶

51:47.271 --> 51:50.739
¶ Well I needed someone ¶

51:50.741 --> 51:55.311
¶ To criticize the things
you've done ¶

51:57.014 --> 51:58.080
(Angela groans)

51:58.082 --> 52:03.152
¶ You've really got a hold on
me, baby ¶

52:03.488 --> 52:08.557
¶ You got a hold on me now ¶

52:08.960 --> 52:14.029
¶ You really got a hold on me,
baby ¶

52:15.066 --> 52:20.236
¶ You got a hold on me now ¶

52:20.238 --> 52:25.174
¶ How many ways have
we tried to get along ¶

52:25.176 --> 52:29.378
¶ Tryin' to harmonize the
same old song ¶

52:31.082 --> 52:34.016
¶ Now I have you and I
tried to be someone ¶

52:34.018 --> 52:36.085
- [Angela] Frank.

52:36.087 --> 52:38.354
Frank? (crying)
- Leave me alone.

52:38.356 --> 52:43.425
- [Angela] (crying) Hey,
what the fuck?

52:45.930 --> 52:48.731
(Angela sobbing)

52:57.775 --> 52:59.041
- How many nights I gotta do it?

52:59.043 --> 53:00.509
- You heard him.
- Yeah, all right.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.844
(men chattering)

53:01.846 --> 53:02.678
- Hey, what's up, man?

53:02.680 --> 53:03.512
- Hey, hey.
- What's goin' on.

53:03.514 --> 53:07.483
(speaking in foreign language)

53:13.357 --> 53:14.190
- Later.

53:14.192 --> 53:17.493
(ominous music)

53:17.495 --> 53:21.497
(speaking in foreign language)

53:25.703 --> 53:28.170
- (speaking in
foreign language),
gimme your fuckin' money.

53:28.172 --> 53:32.241
(speaking in foreign language)

53:32.243 --> 53:33.275
What the fuck you lookin' at?

53:33.277 --> 53:35.177
I said gimme your fuckin' money,
man.

53:35.179 --> 53:39.515
(speaking in foreign language)

53:39.517 --> 53:44.587
(hood screaming)
(dramatic music)

54:08.946 --> 54:12.114
(soft ominous music)

54:15.052 --> 54:17.853
(doorbell rings)

54:30.034 --> 54:31.367
(Janie chuckles)
(suspenseful music)

54:31.369 --> 54:33.135
- I'm workin' late again.

54:33.137 --> 54:34.536
Have you made up your mind?

54:35.506 --> 54:38.641
- I have, come in, sit.

54:42.113 --> 54:43.212
- So, sounds like you

54:46.717 --> 54:48.617
may have finally come
to your senses.

54:49.854 --> 54:50.753
- Yup.

54:54.225 --> 54:55.124
You got me.

54:56.761 --> 54:58.827
- Might not be that bad.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.497
You might even like it.

55:01.499 --> 55:02.731
I know I will.

55:10.207 --> 55:11.106
- [Janie] When?

55:12.677 --> 55:13.575
- Now.

55:15.980 --> 55:20.182
- You do know that this is
highly, highly irregular, right?

55:24.255 --> 55:27.389
What do you say we start
with a glass of wine?

55:27.391 --> 55:28.223
- Yeah.

55:28.225 --> 55:29.958
Yeah, I'd like that.

55:30.728 --> 55:35.631
- And then you tell me your
deepest, darkest fantasy.

55:37.134 --> 55:39.968
- (grunts) Yeah.

55:50.081 --> 55:53.015
I've always had this fantasy,

55:53.017 --> 55:55.584
you're waiting at home for me.

55:58.122 --> 56:02.057
You're on the floor, you're
laid out and I take a shot--

56:02.059 --> 56:05.027
(frying pan thudding)

56:05.029 --> 56:07.129
- [Janie] You fucked with the
wrong lady.

56:07.131 --> 56:09.465
(Dirk groaning)

56:09.466 --> 56:11.800
Stay the fuck away from me, or
I'll knock you the fuck out.

56:12.937 --> 56:14.603
(furniture clatters)
(Janie gasps)

56:14.605 --> 56:18.440
- I'm not leaving 'til
I get what I came for.

56:19.477 --> 56:20.709
Drop it.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.277
Drop it!

56:22.279 --> 56:25.013
(ominous music)

56:26.751 --> 56:29.251
Get on your knees.

56:39.797 --> 56:42.664
You can't kill me,
'cause if you do

56:42.666 --> 56:43.932
you know what's left for you?

56:44.735 --> 56:47.970
The bars, and beyond that,
more bars.

56:50.107 --> 56:55.144
Just a gray, gray death for
your pretty little self.

56:55.146 --> 56:58.447
Now that's my ticket to what's
sweet between those legs.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.318
- What makes you think
I was gonna kill you?

57:05.489 --> 57:09.358
- You don't know how long
I've been waiting for this.

57:09.360 --> 57:13.629
- Please, please don't do this,
please.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.300
- You know what to do next.

57:19.937 --> 57:20.836
Huh?

57:29.413 --> 57:31.847
(playful music)

57:31.849 --> 57:33.081
(Janie chuckles)

57:33.083 --> 57:34.416
What's so funny?

57:35.653 --> 57:37.753
- You tiny, limp-dicked
motherfucker.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.223
Come on, let's just get this
over with.

57:41.225 --> 57:45.761
- Bitch, I have a real
fuckin' headache right now!

57:45.763 --> 57:48.230
- Oh yeah. (laughs)

57:48.232 --> 57:50.532
- (grumbles) No,
this isn't working.

57:50.534 --> 57:51.967
This isn't working, get
up, get up, get up, get up.

57:51.969 --> 57:52.935
- Okay.

57:52.937 --> 57:53.802
- [Dirk] We're gonna go
to the bedroom.

57:53.804 --> 57:54.736
- Okay.
- Go, go, come on!

57:54.738 --> 57:55.537
- [Janie] Okay.

57:55.539 --> 57:58.607
(suspenseful music)

58:13.157 --> 58:16.291
(suspenseful music)

58:26.003 --> 58:28.537
- I think you know how to
behave enough, don't you?

58:28.539 --> 58:29.438
Sit.

58:33.177 --> 58:37.079
All right, now it's time
for the fun to begin.

58:43.187 --> 58:44.319
Take off my pants.

58:46.357 --> 58:47.890
- Please hear me, just--
- Pull 'em down.

58:47.892 --> 58:49.491
- Please.
- Down!

58:49.493 --> 58:52.561
(suspenseful music)

59:06.110 --> 59:07.776
Now it's your turn.

59:11.015 --> 59:12.614
No, no, no.

59:12.616 --> 59:13.815
Leave the boots on.

59:15.119 --> 59:16.852
I like it when they're on.

59:16.854 --> 59:19.988
(suspenseful music)

59:21.592 --> 59:23.191
- Put the knife down.

59:23.193 --> 59:24.026
- [Janie] I'm only kidding.

59:24.028 --> 59:25.727
- [Frank] Put the knife down.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.296
- [Janie] Let me go so I
can put it down.

59:27.298 --> 59:28.797
- [Frank] Put the fuckin'
knife down, Janie.

59:28.799 --> 59:29.698
- I'm only--

59:29.700 --> 59:30.532
- Janie.
- I was only--

59:30.534 --> 59:31.366
- Put it down now.

59:31.367 --> 59:32.199
- Let go of me so I can
put it down.

59:32.202 --> 59:33.268
- [Frank] I said put it down!

59:33.270 --> 59:34.336
- Let go of me so I can.

59:34.338 --> 59:35.837
- Put it down, I said put it
down now.

59:35.839 --> 59:37.105
- Frank, let go.
- Janie.

59:37.107 --> 59:40.175
(suspenseful music)

59:44.582 --> 59:45.514
- Oh God.

59:47.217 --> 59:50.185
Okay, okay, this is gonna hurt,

59:50.187 --> 59:51.753
but I have to, okay?

59:51.755 --> 59:54.590
Okay. (breathing raggedly)

59:54.592 --> 59:56.992
- Come on, come on, come on.

1:00:04.535 --> 1:00:06.168
All right, now.

1:00:06.170 --> 1:00:08.070
Wasn't so hard, right?

1:00:08.839 --> 1:00:10.405
Right?

1:00:10.407 --> 1:00:13.475
Now it's time for the best part.

1:00:15.379 --> 1:00:18.880
Time to see those sweet
little titties of yours.

1:00:18.882 --> 1:00:19.915
- No.
- Yes.

1:00:19.917 --> 1:00:20.849
- No.

1:00:20.851 --> 1:00:25.921
(Dirk chattering)
(suspenseful music)

1:00:31.028 --> 1:00:32.327
- Oh good Lord.

1:00:39.003 --> 1:00:40.268
(door creaks)

1:00:40.270 --> 1:00:41.603
- You sick motherfucker.

1:00:41.605 --> 1:00:42.638
- Oh my God, Frank!

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.339
- I'm just here to
fix the locks.

1:00:44.341 --> 1:00:45.173
You're dead.

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:46.274
I saw her kill you.

1:00:46.276 --> 1:00:47.292
How can you be alive?

1:00:47.293 --> 1:00:48.309
- Oh my God, Frank.
- I saw her kill you!

1:00:48.312 --> 1:00:49.311
How can you be alive?

1:00:49.313 --> 1:00:50.145
I saw her kill you!

1:00:50.147 --> 1:00:52.881
(Dirk gurgling)

1:00:55.019 --> 1:00:57.753
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh my God!

1:01:01.925 --> 1:01:02.824
Oh my God.

1:01:05.262 --> 1:01:06.395
- Murderer.

1:01:06.397 --> 1:01:07.663
- Oh, no, Frank.

1:01:07.665 --> 1:01:08.664
No, Frank.

1:01:08.666 --> 1:01:09.931
Frank, I swear it was--

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:10.766
- You're next.

1:01:10.768 --> 1:01:12.467
- Frank, Frank, it's me.

1:01:12.469 --> 1:01:13.902
It's Janie.

1:01:13.904 --> 1:01:15.103
Baby, it's me.

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:16.872
Frank, it's Janie.

1:01:16.874 --> 1:01:18.240
It's me, baby.

1:01:18.242 --> 1:01:20.842
I would never hurt you,
I would never do anything

1:01:20.844 --> 1:01:22.010
to hurt you on purpose.

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:23.211
Don't you know that?

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:24.046
Don't you?

1:01:24.048 --> 1:01:25.313
Oh God.

1:01:25.315 --> 1:01:26.314
(Frank growls)

1:01:26.316 --> 1:01:29.785
(soft suspenseful music)

1:01:44.401 --> 1:01:45.667
(phone ringing)

1:01:45.669 --> 1:01:47.703
Come on, come on, come on.

1:01:47.705 --> 1:01:49.438
Chuy, where are you?

1:01:50.307 --> 1:01:51.273
- What's wrong?

1:01:51.275 --> 1:01:53.008
- It's Frank, he's back but
he's mean.

1:01:53.010 --> 1:01:54.643
- Oh my God.
- Meaner than ever.

1:01:54.645 --> 1:01:56.478
- I can't believe that it
actually worked.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:57.879
- He tried to kill me and he
killed Dirk,

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.114
that piece of shit.

1:02:00.317 --> 1:02:01.450
- Holy shit.

1:02:01.452 --> 1:02:02.718
- Where are you?

1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:04.086
- I'm at Rodrigo's shop.

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:05.887
- [Janie] Okay, stay
there, I'm coming to you.

1:02:10.828 --> 1:02:11.793
- You're a genius.

1:02:15.165 --> 1:02:17.866
(Janie panting)

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:26.942
- Gather yourself, Janie.

1:02:28.312 --> 1:02:29.945
Tell us what happened.

1:02:29.947 --> 1:02:31.246
- It was Frank.

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:35.050
He came home and it was
him, but it wasn't him.

1:02:36.653 --> 1:02:38.353
Oh God, he looked real bad.

1:02:39.656 --> 1:02:40.555
- Bad?

1:02:40.557 --> 1:02:41.456
Like how?

1:02:42.326 --> 1:02:43.792
- He wants to kill me, Chuy.

1:02:45.095 --> 1:02:48.296
Oh God, he still thinks I
tried to kill him on purpose.

1:02:48.298 --> 1:02:49.197
- And Dirk?

1:02:51.335 --> 1:02:52.968
- He's dead.

1:02:52.970 --> 1:02:54.503
Frank cut him up, he's dead.

1:02:54.505 --> 1:02:55.403
- Jesus.

1:02:55.405 --> 1:03:01.343
- There's a solution if you
feel he's a danger to you.

1:03:01.345 --> 1:03:02.444
(soft piano music)

1:03:02.446 --> 1:03:03.378
- What?

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:05.147
- Another spell.

1:03:05.149 --> 1:03:08.416
I'll need to remove his heart

1:03:09.219 --> 1:03:12.354
and reverse what we've created.

1:03:12.356 --> 1:03:15.824
It can work because he truly

1:03:15.826 --> 1:03:20.228
is not among the living,
not truly.

1:03:21.698 --> 1:03:26.768
And you, my dear, will
have to eat his heart.

1:03:29.173 --> 1:03:30.071
Go.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.240
Bring him back to me.

1:03:33.377 --> 1:03:34.209
Go!

1:03:34.211 --> 1:03:35.377
- Let's go, Janie, come on.

1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:37.212
- Okay.

1:03:37.214 --> 1:03:38.113
Okay.

1:03:42.653 --> 1:03:45.720
(suspenseful music)

1:04:12.282 --> 1:04:13.748
(door thuds)

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:16.451
(ominous music)

1:04:33.737 --> 1:04:36.771
(Rodrigo cries out)

1:04:39.543 --> 1:04:42.544
(Rodrigo gurgling)

1:04:47.150 --> 1:04:49.951
(Frank growling)

1:04:59.129 --> 1:05:02.097
(Rodrigo coughing)

1:05:14.745 --> 1:05:17.479
(Chuy grunting)

1:05:19.650 --> 1:05:21.216
- [Chuy] Ah, fuck.

1:05:27.224 --> 1:05:28.957
- [Janie] All right.

1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:31.459
- [Chuy] Oh fuck.

1:05:33.230 --> 1:05:35.530
(suspenseful music)

1:05:35.532 --> 1:05:36.932
- It's Frank.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.333
- [Janie] Shit, listen
we gotta get outta here.

1:05:38.335 --> 1:05:39.167
- Where? We need to get him.

1:05:39.169 --> 1:05:40.001
- Are you serious?

1:05:40.003 --> 1:05:40.802
He's tryin' to kill me.

1:05:40.804 --> 1:05:41.636
- You killed him!

1:05:41.638 --> 1:05:42.470
- You're not listening to me.

1:05:42.472 --> 1:05:43.471
- And you're full of shit.

1:05:43.473 --> 1:05:44.706
- Frank, fuck, listen.

1:05:44.708 --> 1:05:45.573
It was an accident.

1:05:45.575 --> 1:05:46.474
Tell him it was an accident.

1:05:46.476 --> 1:05:47.309
- Get the fuck outta here,

1:05:47.311 --> 1:05:48.710
Janie!
- No it wasn't!

1:05:48.712 --> 1:05:50.612
- Frank, just calm down, man,
it's me.

1:05:50.614 --> 1:05:52.013
- I'm not here for you.

1:05:52.015 --> 1:05:53.448
I'm here for that bitch.

1:05:53.450 --> 1:05:54.582
- She's your wife.

1:05:55.519 --> 1:05:57.786
- She's a fuckin' murderer,
Chuy.

1:05:57.788 --> 1:05:59.554
My skin is dying.

1:05:59.556 --> 1:06:01.556
My insides, I'm burning inside.

1:06:01.558 --> 1:06:03.124
I want her to feel
what I'm feeling.

1:06:03.126 --> 1:06:04.726
- We were trying to help you.

1:06:05.696 --> 1:06:07.028
- With the (speaking in
foreign language)?

1:06:07.798 --> 1:06:11.166
He put me in the dirt,
Chuy, like a fuckin' rat.

1:06:12.169 --> 1:06:13.134
Get out of my way.

1:06:14.504 --> 1:06:15.403
- What are you tryin' to do?

1:06:15.405 --> 1:06:17.305
- I said get outta my way.

1:06:18.108 --> 1:06:18.940
- Do it.

1:06:18.942 --> 1:06:21.576
- I'm sorry, Frank. (grunts)

1:06:22.946 --> 1:06:23.812
Frank, no.

1:06:24.715 --> 1:06:25.847
(Chuy screams)

1:06:25.849 --> 1:06:27.215
- Both of you, please get up.

1:06:27.217 --> 1:06:29.818
(Janie grunts)

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:31.219
(Janie coughing)

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:32.120
No.

1:06:33.357 --> 1:06:34.322
Frank.

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:36.858
(suspenseful music)

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:38.660
(Janie gasping)

1:06:38.662 --> 1:06:40.495
(Frank growls)

1:06:40.497 --> 1:06:41.830
- Frank.

1:06:41.832 --> 1:06:44.566
(Chuy grunting)

1:06:55.679 --> 1:06:56.578
Frank!

1:06:58.382 --> 1:07:03.451
(Chuy grunting)
(bat thudding)

1:07:10.093 --> 1:07:12.827
(ominous music)

1:07:19.336 --> 1:07:20.402
You're okay.

1:07:22.039 --> 1:07:24.472
You're all right, come on.

1:07:24.474 --> 1:07:26.074
Come on.
- Let's get him in the car.

1:07:26.076 --> 1:07:26.975
- Yeah.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:37.419
Come on.

1:07:46.329 --> 1:07:49.064
(Chuy grunting)

1:07:51.401 --> 1:07:52.300
Rodrigo.

1:07:53.236 --> 1:07:55.637
I was hopin' Frank just stole
your car.

1:07:55.639 --> 1:07:56.871
Fuck.

1:07:56.873 --> 1:07:58.940
- I'm not touching that
book of his.

1:07:58.942 --> 1:08:01.176
- I don't know, Janie.

1:08:01.178 --> 1:08:03.478
Let's do it without the book.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.046
- Okay.

1:08:05.047 --> 1:08:06.613
- [Chuy] We have to
cut his heart out.

1:08:06.616 --> 1:08:07.582
- No.

1:08:07.584 --> 1:08:09.350
- There's no time to argue.

1:08:09.352 --> 1:08:11.019
We have to do this.

1:08:12.122 --> 1:08:14.689
- I can't do it, I can't do it.

1:08:14.691 --> 1:08:17.525
- This is not Frank anymore.

1:08:17.527 --> 1:08:18.426
Help me.

1:08:20.030 --> 1:08:21.963
(ominous music)

1:08:21.965 --> 1:08:24.599
(Chuy grunting)

1:08:24.601 --> 1:08:26.801
(Janie cries out)

1:08:26.803 --> 1:08:29.237
(Frank growling)

1:08:29.239 --> 1:08:30.939
- [Janie] Oh God.

1:08:30.941 --> 1:08:31.840
Oh my God.

1:08:32.642 --> 1:08:35.210
(Chuy and Janie groan)

1:08:35.212 --> 1:08:36.644
Oh my God.

1:08:36.646 --> 1:08:37.545
Oh my God.

1:08:40.016 --> 1:08:41.850
- I don't believe it.

1:08:43.787 --> 1:08:44.619
(Frank growls)

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:45.453
- Oh my God.

1:08:45.455 --> 1:08:46.321
- Put me in a ship

1:08:46.323 --> 1:08:47.789
- [Janie] Oh my God.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:48.623
Oh my God.

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:49.791
- Janie, eat it.

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:51.092
- No.

1:08:51.093 --> 1:08:52.392
- [Chuy] Janie, eat the
fuckin' heart!

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:54.963
- Oh my God. (cries out)

1:08:54.965 --> 1:08:58.032
(suspenseful music)

1:08:59.603 --> 1:09:03.238
(Janie breathing raggedly)

1:09:07.277 --> 1:09:08.510
- [Chuy] Fuck.

1:09:09.346 --> 1:09:12.981
(Janie breathing raggedly)

1:09:20.957 --> 1:09:23.958
(soft piano music)

1:09:44.548 --> 1:09:45.380
- All right, forget it.

1:09:45.382 --> 1:09:46.481
You guys cheers.

1:09:46.483 --> 1:09:47.348
- All right, got it.

1:09:47.350 --> 1:09:48.750
- To bad livers.

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:51.619
- And good looks.

1:09:51.621 --> 1:09:53.821
- Aww, and to my husband.

1:09:53.823 --> 1:09:56.324
- [Frank] Now that's my girl.

1:09:57.260 --> 1:09:59.294
- Seriously, I'm right here,
guys.

1:09:59.296 --> 1:10:00.728
(Frank chuckles)

1:10:00.730 --> 1:10:03.865
(somber piano music)

1:10:14.377 --> 1:10:15.944
- Oh my God, this.

1:10:16.846 --> 1:10:17.745
I can't.

1:10:25.589 --> 1:10:27.322
- What's that about?

1:10:28.291 --> 1:10:30.592
- The way he looks at her.

1:10:30.594 --> 1:10:32.627
It makes me sick.

1:10:32.629 --> 1:10:35.930
(dramatic piano music)

1:10:54.784 --> 1:10:57.852
(suspenseful music)

1:11:26.483 --> 1:11:29.284
(dramatic music)

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:34.055
(suspenseful music)

1:11:57.981 --> 1:12:00.548
- It's as good a place as any.

1:12:01.851 --> 1:12:03.251
- Yeah, I guess.

1:12:05.855 --> 1:12:07.155
Let's dump 'em.

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:13.594
(water splashes)

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:21.602
(Janie groans)
(water splashes)

1:12:21.604 --> 1:12:23.971
- I don't think it fully worked.

1:12:23.973 --> 1:12:24.839
- Oh, don't say that.

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:27.909
(suspenseful music)

1:12:29.813 --> 1:12:32.413
Chuy, when are you gonna find
yourself a nice lady, huh?

1:12:33.383 --> 1:12:35.416
- [Chuy] That is the question.

1:12:36.786 --> 1:12:38.686
Nothin' long term for me,
though.

1:12:39.723 --> 1:12:43.458
I think I'll take my chances
with good old-fashioned lust.

1:12:46.296 --> 1:12:47.195
Frank.

1:12:48.365 --> 1:12:49.263
Frank.

1:12:50.767 --> 1:12:52.333
- Baby.
- No, sorry.

1:12:54.070 --> 1:12:56.904
I'm just wishin' we can get
away from here for a while.

1:12:58.174 --> 1:13:01.075
Sail down to South America,
Caribbean.

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:02.977
Doesn't matter where.

1:13:03.980 --> 1:13:09.050
Just you and the sea,
breeze and peace of mind.

1:13:10.587 --> 1:13:13.788
(ominous music)

1:13:13.790 --> 1:13:17.325
- This is where he would've
wanted to be anyway, by water.

1:13:18.395 --> 1:13:21.229
- I can't say he's too happy
about his company, though.

1:13:25.268 --> 1:13:26.868
Come on.

1:13:26.870 --> 1:13:27.769
Let's row.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.540
(Janie sighs)

1:13:32.542 --> 1:13:35.276
(ominous music)

1:13:52.962 --> 1:13:56.431
(soft suspenseful music)

1:14:47.450 --> 1:14:50.618
(ominous rock music)

1:15:47.977 --> 1:15:51.145
(ominous rock music)

1:16:49.105 --> 1:16:53.107
(bright acoustic guitar music)

1:17:07.690 --> 1:17:11.492
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:17:11.494 --> 1:17:16.430
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:17:16.432 --> 1:17:21.502
¶ I hear voices late
in the night ¶

1:17:25.241 --> 1:17:30.311
¶ The song they sing
echoing there ¶

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:34.448
¶ In the pale moonlight ¶

1:17:34.450 --> 1:17:38.753
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:17:38.755 --> 1:17:43.257
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:17:43.259 --> 1:17:47.561
¶ The ancients tell the story ¶

1:17:47.563 --> 1:17:52.166
¶ They tell it so well ¶

1:17:52.168 --> 1:17:57.238
¶ Deep inside the mountain
hides a secret carousel ¶

1:18:01.344 --> 1:18:05.513
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:05.515 --> 1:18:09.717
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:09.719 --> 1:18:14.388
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:14.390 --> 1:18:18.959
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:22.997
¶ The young and old have all
been told ¶

1:18:22.999 --> 1:18:27.668
¶ There's nothing to fear ¶

1:18:27.670 --> 1:18:32.206
¶ Sequester the jester ¶

1:18:32.208 --> 1:18:36.677
¶ As the night draws near ¶

1:18:36.679 --> 1:18:40.915
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:40.917 --> 1:18:45.386
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:45.388 --> 1:18:49.924
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:49.926 --> 1:18:52.493
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:18:59.168 --> 1:19:01.969
(car engine rumbles)

1:19:05.341 --> 1:19:07.908
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:09.979 --> 1:19:14.348
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶
(cow moos)

1:19:14.350 --> 1:19:18.819
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:18.821 --> 1:19:21.388
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:23.192 --> 1:19:27.862
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶
(fire crackling)

1:19:27.864 --> 1:19:31.899
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:31.901 --> 1:19:36.537
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:36.539 --> 1:19:39.373
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

1:19:39.375 --> 1:19:44.445
(wind whistling)
(footsteps crunching)
