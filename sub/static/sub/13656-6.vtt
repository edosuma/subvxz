40:20.293 --> 40:21.626
Yeah,
he's on the chess team.

40:21.661 --> 40:23.028
Really?

40:23.062 --> 40:24.796
Yeah, and... and now that
I'm out of emergency care,

40:24.831 --> 40:26.064
I could join
the chess team, and...

40:26.099 --> 40:27.266
and they could use me

40:27.300 --> 40:28.634
because they are terrible
right now.

40:28.668 --> 40:30.836
And I-I like
my history teacher and...

40:30.870 --> 40:33.105
and the laptop
they gave me and...

40:35.008 --> 40:37.676
I don't know. I-I thought
we were getting along.

40:37.711 --> 40:38.677
Aren't we?

40:38.712 --> 40:40.012
Yes, we are.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.346
Really well.

40:41.381 --> 40:43.916
Rusty,
listen, um...

40:43.950 --> 40:45.684
I'm just presenting you
with the facts

40:45.719 --> 40:46.752
as I promised I would.

40:46.786 --> 40:48.320
Meeting your
biological father...

40:48.354 --> 40:51.023
it's entirely up to you.

40:53.193 --> 40:54.960
Well, then,
I don't want to.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.830
He might not even
know about me,

40:57.865 --> 41:00.000
but I definitely
don't need to know about him.

41:01.936 --> 41:03.804
So, if...
if you really mean that

41:03.838 --> 41:05.939
and you don't mind me
hanging around,

41:05.974 --> 41:07.875
I-I think I'm happy
where I am.

41:11.012 --> 41:13.280
Well, then...

41:13.314 --> 41:16.183
Let's try
and keep it that way.

41:22.891 --> 41:25.192
