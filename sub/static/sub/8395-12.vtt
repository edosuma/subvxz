WEBVTT

00:02.650 --> 00:05.232
_ I'm not_ sure _about_ _
thlS operation thlng, MIIIIe.

00:05.350 --> 00:06.169
We'll talk about it.
We'll talk to the kids.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.487
We'll make the decision,
you and me.

00:08.590 --> 00:09.727
Okay.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.070
There's hope.

00:11.180 --> 00:12.511
We just have to do
a lot of work.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.245
Whatever it is,
we will work it out.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.422
- Okay?
- I will never leave you again.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.565
What are you telling me?
Are we getting married?

00:18.670 --> 00:21.730
Mm-hmm.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.774
The Luncheonette...I'm just
going over these numbers again.

00:23.880 --> 00:24.869
I thought we were
done with that.

00:24.990 --> 00:25.911
Jasmine came to talk
to me about it.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.499
I've changed my mind.

00:27.610 --> 00:31.296
Let's make The Luncheonette
sall once again.

00:32.410 --> 00:33.479
[Adam]
Crosby, come on,
can we not have

00:33.580 --> 00:35.309
another conversation
about mIXIng boards?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.401
- We have to talk mixing boards.
- Dude, you're high.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.476
- Huh? No, no, no, no, no.
You're low.

00:39.590 --> 00:41.103
- You need to raise yours.
- Lower it.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.030
- No, listen.
- Just lower it.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.314
Hey, there's a lot of gorgeous
models out in the marketplace,

00:46.420 --> 00:48.763
and I want to try one
before we commit.

00:48.870 --> 00:51.111
I don't want to just marry the
first girl I date like you did.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.289
She's not first girl I dated.

00:52.390 --> 00:53.288
Anyway, we shouldn't
be spending

00:53.390 --> 00:54.379
any money right now
on the studio.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.183
Why? We have
insurance money coming.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.211
[Adam]
'Cause we haven't gotten
the insurance check yet.

00:57.330 --> 00:58.399
Okay, well, the second
that check comes in,

00:58.500 --> 00:59.944
we got to restock
The Luncheonette so we can be

01:00.060 --> 01:01.391
operational and make sure--
- We will.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.398
We're got to make sure
that it's within our budget.

01:02.510 --> 01:03.431
We just have to get
a mixing board

01:03.540 --> 01:04.814
that's within
our budget, okay?

01:04.920 --> 01:06.194
Mr. Braverman, the sign

01:06.300 --> 01:09.997
on that side's a little lower
from that side.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.169
That's right.
It's a little low.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.259
[Adam]
You know what, Edgar?
We're on it.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.278
We're gonna lower
that other side.

01:13.380 --> 01:14.233
All right, well,
Mr. Braverman

01:14.350 --> 01:17.069
says that I need a mentor
for career week.

01:17.180 --> 01:18.727
- Right?
- Will you be my mentor?

01:18.830 --> 01:20.513
[Crosby]
Oh, you want to get
into the music business?

01:20.630 --> 01:22.484
I got to say, I noticed
a little rock and roll swagger

01:22.590 --> 01:23.591
when you walked out.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.112
Well, I kind of want
to be a French chef.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.289
[Adam]
Chef, that's great, Edgar.

01:27.390 --> 01:28.766
That's a great goal.
- All right.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.324
But you know what, we should
probably get you a real chef

01:30.430 --> 01:32.637
to be your mentor because
I'm a recording studio executive

01:32.740 --> 01:34.844
and to be honest, I don't know
that much about cooking.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.156
Well, that didn't stop you
from getting

01:36.260 --> 01:37.579
into the music business.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.717
Lack of knowledge.
- I want you, Mr. Braverman.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.503
It's got to be you.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.819
Edgar, it would be an honor
to be your mentor.

01:47.930 --> 01:49.511
All right.

01:49.620 --> 01:50.894
- I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.139
I won't let you down.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.558
Wasn't that nice?

01:54.660 --> 01:56.139
How are you gonna teach him
about French cooking?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.069
I will get a French cookbook.
I'll figure it out.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.215
Why don't you teach him
diesel mechanics

01:58.320 --> 01:59.662
or karate
or something like that?

01:59.770 --> 02:00.998
You don't think I can
figure out how to help him

02:01.120 --> 02:02.496
be a French cook?
- No, I do not.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.182
In fact, I have very serious,
serious doubts about the success

02:05.290 --> 02:06.461
of this school knowing
that you're gonna teach.

02:06.570 --> 02:07.468
Well, I can, my friend.
All right, all right.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.673
I'm gonna fix this sign and--

02:08.780 --> 02:09.599
[Crosby]
Great, great.

02:09.710 --> 02:11.086
You're going
the wrong direction

02:11.200 --> 02:13.122
with this one, Braverman.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.640
- So dad's moving back in?
- That's right.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.058
He's moving back in.
- Moving back in.

02:16.170 --> 02:20.448
It's gonna be just like it was.
- Finally.

02:20.550 --> 02:21.892
[Julia]
Oh, hey, Victor,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.468
I understand if this is a lot
to process. It's--

02:24.590 --> 02:27.445
You're moving back
in forever?

02:27.560 --> 02:29.585
Yes.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.100
It's permanent?

02:32.220 --> 02:34.359
Yeah.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.904
How can you be so sure?

02:36.010 --> 02:40.356
What--how do you know?

02:40.470 --> 02:42.324
Well, we talked about
that a lot, actually,

02:42.430 --> 02:45.843
and we wanted to make sure.

02:45.950 --> 02:49.841
_ And when it comes
right down to It, we just--

02:49.960 --> 02:51.848
we just love each other,

02:51.960 --> 02:53.541
and so--

02:53.650 --> 02:54.958
And we've always
loved each other, you know,

02:57.620 --> 03:01.340
So what happens
when the next problem comes up?

03:01.450 --> 03:02.894
What happens
when you guys fight?

03:03.010 --> 03:05.274
Then what?

03:08.420 --> 03:10.217
What about, like,
an outdoor ceremony, you know?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.662
I'm sure 'cause here--

03:11.770 --> 03:13.283
This fortune cookie will
tell me where we're haVIng--

03:13.400 --> 03:14.731
Here, it says Bruce Willis
did it at a poolside cabana.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.704
It's pretty nice.
- "You're a fun-loving person,

03:15.810 --> 03:17.220
and you will
find much happiness."

03:17.330 --> 03:19.366
I don't want
any lame cllch gazebo--

03:19.470 --> 03:20.812
[Sarah]
We're not gonna have a gazebo.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.150
Crap. You know what--
I mean, it should be special.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.646
- Like, a beach?
- But then, what do you picture?

03:24.750 --> 03:25.671
I don't understand.
- Or, like--|ike, an island?

03:25.790 --> 03:26.984
- I always thought,
like, a volcano.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.169
Maybe the--
I'm sorry, what?

03:28.270 --> 03:29.578
Yeah, a dormant volcano.

03:29.690 --> 03:30.896
- Did he say "volcano?"
- That doesn't sound crazy.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.785
I've always dreamed of having
my second wedding at a volcano.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.447
Not on the volcano,
but the base of it.

03:33.550 --> 03:34.790
You got to think
of it artistically.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.060
- I can see it now.
- That's not an omen

03:36.180 --> 03:37.340
or anything.
- Grandma tripping.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.485
- In Bora Bora, Mount Pelini...
- Mount Pelini?

03:38.590 --> 03:39.864
That's not a real mountain.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.073
- I don't want it at--
- How about there?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.386
There's a dormant volcano.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.457
I climbed it with this guy.
- This is pointless.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.697
How do you know
it's dormant though?

03:44.810 --> 03:46.118
What about a cave?

03:46.220 --> 03:47.255
No, I don't want
to get married in a cave.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.804
[Hank]
No, I'm dead serious.
I'm dead serious.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.184
- They're so scary.
- We won't make it scary.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.530
And they're moist,
and my hair will be terrible.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.846
It'll be frizzy and damp.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.679
That's what--contrast.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.463
That's what art is about,
contrast, photography.

03:56.580 --> 03:57.501
No, it's not.
Not when you're getting married.

03:57.610 --> 03:58.747
Yes, you have the beauty
of a wedding...

03:58.850 --> 03:59.885
Mom...Mom!

03:59.990 --> 04:01.025
- Mom, Mom!
- What, what?

04:01.130 --> 04:02.301
I think I'm having
a contraction.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.298
- What? Oh, my--oh.
- Ow, ow, ow.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.752
What are you doing?
Sit down.

04:05.860 --> 04:06.610
- Ow.
- Calm, calm.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.721
Just stay calm now.
Just stay calm.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.899
Are you sure?
I mean, does it hurt?

04:09.000 --> 04:09.614
[overlapping chatter]

04:09.730 --> 04:11.061
Everybody breathe
and stay calm.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.317
[Sarah]
I'm getting your bag,
I'm getting your bag.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.001
Get my car. Get my coffee.
Do you want ice chips?

04:14.110 --> 04:15.270
You want ice chips?
- She doesn't want ice chips.

04:15.390 --> 04:17.142
She's cold.
- That's with tonsils, right?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.285
[Sarah]
You always get cold when you
get a contraction. She's cold.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.459
Wait, where are my keys?
Where are the keys?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.141
[Sarah]
I don't know where the--
you're In charge

04:21.260 --> 04:22.659
of knowing where the keys are.
- Stay calm.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.840
I got-- you know, in the car,
I'll put on some pop music.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.156
- Excuse me, what is happening?
- I've got an Air Supply--

04:26.260 --> 04:27.295
[overlapping chatter]

04:29.820 --> 04:30.957
Come on, Zeek.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.197
We're almost there.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.608
Just a little bit more.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.268
Yeah, I'm coming, Millie,
coming.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.406
You know,

04:38.510 --> 04:40.614
we've heard about this view
for so many years,

04:40.720 --> 04:44.486
and we've never
gotten up here.

04:44.590 --> 04:46.239
Yeah, okay, we'll--
we'll see it all, Millie.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.386
- We'll see it. Yeah.
- Yeah, we will.

04:50.940 --> 04:55.309
Just a second.
I just need a breather here.

04:55.430 --> 04:58.593
Damn it.
Oh, God.

04:58.710 --> 05:01.395
Well, you know, this is--

05:01.500 --> 05:05.220
This is kind of
perfect right here.

05:05.330 --> 05:08.128
Look, I think
this is our spot.

05:08.230 --> 05:10.095
Really?

05:10.200 --> 05:13.954
Yeah, it's beautiful.

05:14.070 --> 05:15.856
Yeah, it is beautiful.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.961
Okay.

05:18.070 --> 05:20.379
Ah, man.

05:20.490 --> 05:24.142
Oh, Millie,
I'm so tired of this.

05:24.250 --> 05:27.071
Oh, God.

05:33.810 --> 05:37.086
I've been...

05:37.190 --> 05:39.124
I've been thinking
about what the doctor said,

05:39.230 --> 05:41.949
you know, about the operation.

05:43.750 --> 05:47.163
I don't want
to go through it again.

05:47.270 --> 05:51.821
I just want to
live my life, Millie.

05:51.930 --> 05:55.138
Enjoy every moment
I got left.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.032
Yeah.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.618
I don't want--I don't want
to go under the knife again.

06:02.740 --> 06:03.525
That's--

06:03.630 --> 06:06.451
I don't want to do that.

06:06.570 --> 06:10.609
Just--it's too much.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.889
I think this is
the right thing to do.

06:18.990 --> 06:24.166
I think it's what's--
what's best for us.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.611
Okay.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.386
You're with me?

06:35.740 --> 06:38.800
Of course I'm with you.

06:40.260 --> 06:43.184
I'm always with you.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.469
Yeah.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.680
[Bob Dylan]
May God bless
and keep you always

06:55.790 --> 06:58.338
And may your wishes
all come true

06:58.450 --> 07:00.475
May you always do
for others

07:00.590 --> 07:02.865
And let others do for you

07:02.970 --> 07:05.768
May you build a ladder
to the stars

07:05.870 --> 07:07.451
And climb on every rung

07:07.560 --> 07:09.972
And may you stay

07:10.080 --> 07:12.492
Forever young

07:12.600 --> 07:15.216
May you grow up
to be righteous

07:15.330 --> 07:17.639
May you grow up
to be true

07:17.740 --> 07:19.844
May you always know
the truth

07:19.950 --> 07:22.362
And see the lights
surrounding you

07:22.470 --> 07:24.779
May you always be
courageous

07:24.890 --> 07:27.051
Stand upright
and be strong

07:27.170 --> 07:29.161
And may you stay

07:29.270 --> 07:31.921
Forever young

07:32.030 --> 07:34.089
May you stay

07:34.210 --> 07:36.724
Forever young

07:38.180 --> 07:40.000
[Sarah] We're almost there.
[Hank] Breathe.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.384
Okay, calm, calm, calm.

07:41.490 --> 07:43.720
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just go. Ow, ow, ow.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.909
[Hank]
You're in the ocean.

07:45.010 --> 07:46.420
- You just--
- Stop it with the ocean.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.804
- Just drive.
- Okay, I'm driving.

07:47.910 --> 07:49.559
Hank, you're going so slow!

07:49.670 --> 07:51.012
We're not gonna get
into an accident now.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.257
Okay, well, I don't want to have
a baby in the back of a car.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.840
Hank, just go!
[groans] Drive!

07:54.950 --> 07:56.702
- All right, fine, fine, fine.
[horn honks]

07:56.820 --> 07:58.469
- Just stay calm.
- It's a red light!

07:58.580 --> 08:01.162
[both scream]

08:01.270 --> 08:02.294
We're in the ocean.

08:02.410 --> 08:04.435
Can't you just drive
like a normal person?

08:04.550 --> 08:05.642
- Stay calm, stay calm.
- Slow down.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.613
Slow down, slow down.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.893
[TV in background]

08:09.000 --> 08:09.989
[groans]

08:10.110 --> 08:12.749
Pregnant lady. Where do we go?
Pregnant lady.

08:12.870 --> 08:13.689
- Where's the baby?
- What are you doing here?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.552
- Her stomach, obviously.
- Ow!

08:15.660 --> 08:17.173
[Crosby]
No, you texted
that she has a baby.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.281
Why are we talking
about what I texted to you?

08:18.390 --> 08:19.732
Your whole text--
it said, "Baby,"

08:19.840 --> 08:20.738
three exclamation points,
"hospital."

08:20.840 --> 08:22.876
Uh, that means
the baby's coming.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.254
Get to the hospital
when you can.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.588
[overlapping chatter]

08:25.710 --> 08:26.938
- Where's the baby?
- Not here yet.

08:27.050 --> 08:28.119
- Coming.
- Right?

08:28.230 --> 08:29.299
[Hank]
Out of the way.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.288
Yeah,
that text was confusing.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.777
So you just got there?

08:33.890 --> 08:35.881
Okay, she just got there.
Good.

08:35.990 --> 08:39.027
Well,
how many centimeters is she?

08:39.130 --> 08:41.542
You don't--okay, good.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.094
There's no rush.
Good, I'll see you there.

08:43.210 --> 08:46.179
Okay, bye.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.455
Oh, let's clear this out
for you.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.766
You did
some undenNear shopping.

08:51.870 --> 08:55.761
Yup, went shopping.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.877
- It's different.
- Yeah.

08:59.980 --> 09:00.901
There we go.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.942
All right.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.785
And you put the TV in here.
I saw that.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.232
- Yeah, from the guest bedroom.
- Yeah.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.717
Nobody was watching in there,
and I'm alone in here, so--

09:13.820 --> 09:15.788
I'll put a wall mount up.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.299
It'll save us some space.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.924
Great.
That's a great idea.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.891
[Crosby]
Cootchie-cootchie-coo!
Goo-goo-ga-ga.

09:24.010 --> 09:25.659
What is it with hospital
gift shops? I don't get it.

09:25.770 --> 09:26.930
I want you to practice
holding the baby.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.667
They got nothing.
They got nothing here.

09:28.770 --> 09:30.146
Should we get
some of the bubblegum ones?

09:30.250 --> 09:31.899
- Ooh, get a royal carnation.
- Let's get a couple of these.

09:32.010 --> 09:32.908
I mean,
the bubblegum would be

09:33.020 --> 09:33.805
better than these
'cause these are--

09:33.910 --> 09:35.559
I'll tell you what, guys.
I'm buying.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.841
- These are nice.
- No, that's weak. Put it down.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.258
- That's horrible.
- I tell you, you know what?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.814
It's nice--we've been spending
so much time in hospitals,

09:39.920 --> 09:40.909
we finally have something
to celebrate.

09:41.020 --> 09:42.908
Let's get good ones.
Do you have Camachos?

09:43.030 --> 09:44.816
Camachos, the cigar.
You should have Camachos.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.887
If you're here,
why don't we get good ones?

09:45.990 --> 09:46.922
Hank, I think
these are the best they got.

09:47.030 --> 09:47.997
I think we're gonna
have to settle for these.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.306
The big-time wrestler?
You got Hector Camachos?

09:49.410 --> 09:50.820
- You're gonna have to suffer.
- Oh, they're horrible.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.852
- All right.
- Can you get through it?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.824
- We'll see.
- We can take it, I guess.

09:54.930 --> 09:55.965
You go troll the area
for some Camachos--

09:56.070 --> 09:57.344
No, it's all right.
Who cares, right?

09:57.450 --> 09:58.587
- And, you know...
- We're having a baby, right?

09:58.700 --> 09:59.348
The baby will be one
or two years old by the time--

09:59.460 --> 10:00.415
Get some
of the bubblegum ones.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.213
Can we get
some of the bubblegum ones?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.901
- I almost killed...
- I'm gonna hIt the crapper.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.045
- All three of us in the car.
- Okay.

10:07.810 --> 10:12.179
I'm so happy they worked
everything out, right?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.154
Isn't that great?

10:14.260 --> 10:15.192
Yay, Luncheonette.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.359
Yup.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.189
It's really great.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.813
So great.

10:21.930 --> 10:24.546
It's great.
So great.

10:24.650 --> 10:25.890
Something wrong?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.274
No, I mean,
if you're saying it's great,

10:27.380 --> 10:28.790
then it must be great,
I just--

10:28.900 --> 10:30.299
You don't really seem
like you're--

10:30.420 --> 10:31.751
I'm fine; I just wish
that you wouldn't have

10:31.870 --> 10:34.270
inserted yourself
into this situation.

10:34.390 --> 10:35.379
They had it all figured out.

10:35.490 --> 10:36.798
I didn't insert myself
into anything.

10:36.910 --> 10:37.831
Yes, you kind of did.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.874
You guilted my husband
into doing this.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.878
- I did what?
- You did. You guilted into--

10:40.980 --> 10:42.356
I didn't guilt him
into anything.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.087
Jasmine, they made a decision
to dissolve the business,

10:44.190 --> 10:45.805
and you talked to him, and you
guilted him back into this.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.944
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

10:47.060 --> 10:47.913
Kristina, he's a grown man.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.703
I didn't do--
make him do anything.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.844
The business is failing,
okay?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.086
- It wasn't failing.
- Yes, it was.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.224
And then he felt guilty
about it because of...

10:53.340 --> 10:54.546
And what's wrong
with me talking to him?

10:54.650 --> 10:55.617
I just wanted him to have
all the information.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.618
Crosby taking care of him
and everything else.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.948
That's it.
Wait, what?

10:58.070 --> 10:59.753
And you had to go
and talk to him and make him--

10:59.860 --> 11:00.997
And because he's a child,

11:01.100 --> 11:01.725
I guilted him into making
that decision, right?

11:01.830 --> 11:03.206
It's just--
the problem is,

11:03.310 --> 11:05.722
is he's taken care
of his family for so long.

11:05.830 --> 11:06.967
- It's not fair anymore.
- Kristina.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.172
- What's going on, guys?
- It's not fair.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.099
It's not fair
that he's always the one

11:09.220 --> 11:10.312
to be responsible
for the family.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.626
What's going--
what is this?

11:11.740 --> 11:12.934
No one said he's responsible
for the family.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.280
And I never would've gone
behind my husband's back

11:15.390 --> 11:16.357
- and talked to your husband
about this.
- Oh, but you did.

11:16.460 --> 11:17.631
Wait a minute,
what's going on?

11:17.740 --> 11:18.593
[Crosby]
You didn't do that. You--

11:18.710 --> 11:19.802
- I did.
- It's the truth.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.841
You went and talked to Adam
about our business?

11:20.950 --> 11:22.326
- Yup.
- Yes.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.886
- She didn't do anything wrong.
- When? Right before--

11:24.990 --> 11:26.912
- Right before you--
- What?

11:27.030 --> 11:28.509
Is that why
you changed your mind?

11:28.610 --> 11:29.747
Because my wife
went and talked to you,

11:29.860 --> 11:30.815
and then you pitied me?

11:30.930 --> 11:32.022
- No. It's--
- That's what--

11:32.130 --> 11:33.859
No, Crosby, it doesn't matter.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.609
- It's decided.
- It does matter.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.108
Please hold on a second here.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.347
Dad, it's all right.
I got this.

11:38.450 --> 11:39.792
Look, there's a lot
of reasons, Crosby,

11:39.900 --> 11:40.753
but you got what you wanted.
It's okay.

11:40.870 --> 11:42.383
Well, you don't need
to do me any favors.

11:42.490 --> 11:43.650
I don't need your charity.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.101
Crosby,
you're upsetting your father.

11:45.220 --> 11:46.380
- Is that what you think it is?
- Well, okay, great, good.

11:46.490 --> 11:46.979
'Cause I don't want to take care
of my little brother anymore.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.968
Oh, you were
taking care of me?

11:49.080 --> 11:50.047
Taking care of him?
What is that supposed to mean?

11:50.150 --> 11:51.947
I think I had the idea
for The Luncheonette,

11:52.050 --> 11:53.460
which gave you a job for three
years, not the other way around.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.879
- You're upsetting your father.
- Okay, I'm very sorry.

11:55.990 --> 11:59.539
[overlapping shouting]

11:59.640 --> 12:02.336
Hanging out with musicians,
I'm crunching numbers,

12:02.440 --> 12:03.407
and yeah, sometimes I don't
love it; sometimes I hate it.

12:03.510 --> 12:04.499
You were crunching numbers
at TNS.

12:04.620 --> 12:05.814
- That's life.
- You should leave.

12:05.930 --> 12:06.885
- That's having a job.
- 'Cause I quit.

12:07.000 --> 12:07.887
All right,
so there's no more Luncheonette.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.161
- Crosby, wait.
- Okay, go ahead, quit.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.834
What are you gonna do?

12:21.740 --> 12:22.934
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.768
- Oh.
- It was a false alarm.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.734
Yeah, you know?

12:26.840 --> 12:27.772
It was gas.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.916
- Huh.
- Great.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.338
[siren wails]

12:36.440 --> 12:39.785
Crosby. Crosby.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.233
Hey, you can't throw a tantrum
andleave.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.786
That's the second time
that you've gone behind my back

12:44.900 --> 12:46.106
after I told you something
in private.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.962
You went and told your mom
that I had financial issues,

12:48.070 --> 12:49.412
and then you go tell Adam that,

12:49.520 --> 12:51.579
and everyone knows but me,
and I look stupid?

12:51.700 --> 12:52.860
I'm sorry.
I was trying to help you.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.722
Oh, because I can't
help myself?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.149
- That's not why I did it.
- Listen to me.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.070
I can't be in business
with somebody

12:59.190 --> 13:00.521
who doesn't want
to be in business with me.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.084
I can't have a partnership
like that.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.634
Baby, I just went to Adam
'cause I knew

13:03.740 --> 13:04.672
how much The Luncheonette
means to you.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.839
That's why.
I'm sorry.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.747
It doesn't mean anything
to me now.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.909
What was special about it
was Adam and I.

13:11.030 --> 13:13.260
I don't have that now,
so it doesn't matter.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.101
Yes.

13:23.210 --> 13:24.245
Your chocolate chip pancakes
are so much better than Mom's.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.578
Thank you.
You're right. They are better.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.179
[laughs]
Wow.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.144
Come on, Mom.
You have to give it to him.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.319
- They're so much better.
- No.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.309
Victor,
tell them mine are awesomer.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.569
Well, yours are a little chevw,
but that's totally fine.

13:34.670 --> 13:35.773
- What?
- Okay.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.324
- But other--
- Oh, you guys are the worst.

13:37.430 --> 13:38.328
Other skills.

13:38.430 --> 13:39.180
[phone rings]

13:39.300 --> 13:42.292
Oh, this is work.
I'll be right back.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.435
- You guys want another one?
- Hi.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.223
[Julia]
Not a good time.

13:45.340 --> 13:46.409
Yup.

13:46.510 --> 13:48.307
Uh-huh.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.923
Is Mom is still taking us
to school?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.372
- Yup.
- Um...

13:51.480 --> 13:52.640
If we're late, Mrs. Reese
says I basically fail.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.307
_ _ Mrs. Reese_
is like a slave driver.

13:54.410 --> 13:57.038
Okay, let me ask her.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.448
Hey.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.653
Sorry, can you, um--

14:00.770 --> 14:01.907
Did you still want to take 'em?

14:02.010 --> 14:03.932
Chris, can I call you
right back?

14:04.050 --> 14:05.620
- Thank you.
- Okay, that was Chris?

14:05.740 --> 14:07.184
Yeah, it was Chris.
I'm sorry.

14:07.290 --> 14:09.258
I know, we have a case,
and he's gonna be calling.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.668
- You know, this is part of--
- Yeah, no, I know.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.668
Listen, I understand.
Let us just--

14:12.780 --> 14:15.601
Can it not be when we've having
breakfast with the kids?

14:15.710 --> 14:17.189
- It's our first breakfast...
- I know, and it's going great.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.153
And Victor's
finally opening up.

14:18.270 --> 14:19.498
I know.
It's going so well.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.475
We just--we had
to file this case by 9:00 am,

14:21.580 --> 14:23.434
and so it was getting close,
so I had to take the call.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.472
No, I know.

14:31.310 --> 14:32.174
[Julia]
I'm sorry that it's Chris,

14:32.280 --> 14:34.248
but, you know,
I slept with people.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.454
You slept with people.
It's just--who cares?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.481
Let's go.
Let's--

14:37.600 --> 14:41.457
Wait.
Wait, what?

14:41.570 --> 14:43.765
What do you mean, people?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.599
I mean, you slept with...

14:46.710 --> 14:49.429
Okay, I did not mean to have--

14:49.540 --> 14:51.849
_we don't have time
for this conversation right now.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.293
Okay, right, right,
but how many people?

14:55.410 --> 14:58.095
-JoeL
- Sorry.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.371
- It's--No, it's just--
- Okay.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.401
But just for the record,

15:00.520 --> 15:04.160
I didn't--
I didn't sleep with people.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.508
That's--

15:05.620 --> 15:07.269
All right, we're not having
this conversation right now.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.244
- I'm sorry I brought it up.
- Okay.

15:08.350 --> 15:09.271
_ We can have
this conversation later.

15:09.390 --> 15:12.279
[gentle music]

15:21.500 --> 15:22.808
[Hank]
There it is.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.535
- Oh, wow.
- There it is right there.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.460
Santillana del Mar.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.296
Ah, that's pretty.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.435
You got to--
you got to say it like that.

15:28.540 --> 15:29.746
[laughs]

15:29.850 --> 15:35.379
About ten years ago,
it was an assignment,

15:35.480 --> 15:39.610
and I thought,
"If I ever really get married"--

15:39.730 --> 15:40.719
you know, I didn't think
I was ever getting married--

15:40.830 --> 15:43.412
but I thought,
"Hey, if I ever do"--

15:43.520 --> 15:44.930
Right there.
Look at that photo, right?

15:45.040 --> 15:47.349
- If you--Hmm?
- Yeah.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.928
- Right?
-Hmm.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.974
That's not a gazebo,
that's for sure.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.490
- That'd be cool, wouldn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.532
Yeah.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.256
I mean, someday,
but that seems like a lot

15:59.370 --> 16:01.645
[clears throat]
right now to go

16:01.750 --> 16:03.126
someplace far away.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.538
Yeah, I know.
I know.

16:04.650 --> 16:05.878
No, I'm not gonna,
you know--

16:05.990 --> 16:08.299
- I get it. I--it's also--
- Yeah.

16:08.410 --> 16:10.640
No, I get it. I get it.
I know.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.136
- It's not that I'm not excited.
- No, I don't care.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.753
I'm not--there's no rush.

16:13.860 --> 16:16.795
I'm not pushing it.
I'm just...

16:16.900 --> 16:20.620
Don't worry about it.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.311
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your--

16:22.420 --> 16:24.285
the whole thing
with your dad.

16:24.390 --> 16:25.800
It's okay.

16:25.910 --> 16:29.391
Yeah, you know, I--

16:29.500 --> 16:33.391
just don't--don't know
what that experience is like,

16:33.500 --> 16:34.819
you know, thinking
you're gonna lose your dad.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.151
My dad, you know, my dad left
when I was a little kid,

16:38.270 --> 16:42.092
and I don't even really
know him, but, uh,

16:42.200 --> 16:43.679
I'm just glad you had him
for a long time

16:43.790 --> 16:47.237
'cause he's--
he's got to be a real good guy.

16:47.350 --> 16:49.272
You know,
'cause you're so good.

16:49.380 --> 16:50.449
You're--

16:52.490 --> 16:54.344
You're beautiful._
I mean, you're beautiful.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.836
To look at,
you're very beautiful.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.352
- [chuckles]
- I mean on the inside.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.111
You're--
that's where you're also--

17:02.330 --> 17:04.218
You're a beautiful person,
you know?

17:04.330 --> 17:06.423
And Ijust think, like,
your dad...

17:08.510 --> 17:12.025
He gave you...

17:12.130 --> 17:14.644
you know...

17:15.750 --> 17:18.548
A lot _of love
growmg up.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.547
Thank you.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.267
[groans]

17:44.370 --> 17:46.338
How much longer
do I have to do this?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.364
Oh, could you give me
just five more minutes?

17:49.480 --> 17:51.402
Yeah, ifI don't cramp up.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.714
[sighs]

18:01.800 --> 18:06.169
Um, I think we should

18:06.290 --> 18:08.315
tell the kids
what we talked about.

18:08.430 --> 18:13.356
About...
not having the surgery.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.432
Are you ready
to have that conversation?

18:25.510 --> 18:26.477
No.

18:29.550 --> 18:31.347
But I need to.

18:37.530 --> 18:41.216
So, I mean, we could have--

18:41.320 --> 18:42.423
we could have 'em
over to dinner, you know?

18:42.530 --> 18:47.012
Just the four kids,
and...

18:47.120 --> 18:49.395
we could tell 'em then.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.320
No grandkids,
no distractions,

18:51.440 --> 18:55.080
no...no running around
or anything.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.169
Just the...just us.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.546
Just the original six.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.962
We could tell them.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.822
What do you think?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.384
Okay.

19:17.530 --> 19:18.690
Okay.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.940
Then that's what we'll do.
That's the plan.

19:24.050 --> 19:27.122
[soft music]

19:42.800 --> 19:44.347
All right, Edgar.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.519
It's recipe selection day.
You ready?

19:45.630 --> 19:46.415
- Yup.
- Here's what I'm thinking.

19:46.530 --> 19:47.929
Something French,
something simple.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.553
An omelet.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.934
As your mentor,
what do you say, mentee?

19:52.050 --> 19:53.119
Well, oh, a camera.

19:53.220 --> 19:54.357
Oh, picture opportunity.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.496
Career week. Hey.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.114
- What are you doing?
- Posing for your picture.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.436
No.
I am documenting career week.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.394
- I am not taking selfies.
- Okay.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.262
Hank is my mentor,
and as my mentor,

20:04.370 --> 20:06.645
he has informed me
that we deplore static shots

20:06.750 --> 20:07.785
with fake smiles.

20:07.890 --> 20:09.369
- Okay.
- They literally make us sick.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.822
So don't do this or this.

20:10.930 --> 20:12.648
People don't normally do
those things in conversations.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.035
- Okay, yeah. Thanks, Max.
- I want to make a souffl.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.653
A souffl?

20:16.760 --> 20:18.648
I read in the cookbook
that a true chef

20:18.760 --> 20:22.833
is not a true chef
unless he masters the souffl.

20:22.940 --> 20:24.669
That's true, I'm sure,

20:24.770 --> 20:26.909
but I think that a souffl might
be a little challenging for us.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.181
It might be something
we want to work up to.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.565
- Maybe next year.
- Okay.

20:30.670 --> 20:31.876
Probably doesn't matter
what you cook

20:31.980 --> 20:33.538
since you're probably gonna
end up unemployed anyway.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.119
Max,
what are you talking about?

20:35.230 --> 20:37.460
Autism has
an 85% unemployment rate.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.400
[Adam]
No, that is
not necessarily true.

20:39.510 --> 20:40.579
This is good stuff.
This is raw emotion.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.476
It's not necessarily true,
Max.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.616
It absolutely is.
It is actually--

20:43.720 --> 20:45.403
No, well, it's not gonna
be true here at Chambers, okay?

20:45.520 --> 20:46.919
You guys are all gonna
be employed.

20:47.030 --> 20:48.657
Edgar, you're gonna be employed.
Max, you're gonna be employed.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.341
Dylan, Aaron Brownstein,
Kiara.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.519
Everybody's gonna
be employed, okay?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.485
Dylan might have a shot
because she has no diagnosis,

20:53.590 --> 20:55.478
but the rest of us
are ba5ically screwed.

20:55.590 --> 20:56.830
No, you're not screwed.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.248
You're not screwed.
Don't listen to him, Edgar.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.078
Listen to me.
Max, you're not screwed, okay?

21:00.180 --> 21:01.590
You all have great potential
to have great careers.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.450
- That's extremely subjective.
- And I'll tell you something.

21:02.570 --> 21:06.358
Edgan
we are making that souffl.

21:06.470 --> 21:07.391
I'll get started.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.398
- Dad, look this way.
- Souffl it is.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.539
We have declared it.
Souffl.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.504
Dad, this last photo of you
was terrible.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.430
[Adam]
Okay, that's all right.

21:16.550 --> 21:19.474
Go round and round

21:19.580 --> 21:24.062
Painted ponies
go up and down

21:24.170 --> 21:28.618
We're captive
on the carousel

21:28.730 --> 21:31.346
Of time

21:31.460 --> 21:33.792
Hey, you're playing our song.

21:33.910 --> 21:35.457
- Yeah_. Hi.
- Hi.

21:35.570 --> 21:37.424
What's your excuse
for coming by this time?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.464
I don't have one; I just
felt like coming by again.

21:39.570 --> 21:41.253
Wow. You look good.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.531
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.982
You okay? I'm headed
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

21:44.090 --> 21:46.536
- I'm fine. I have a phone.
- Ah, a phone.

21:46.650 --> 21:48.026
- I forget.
- Yes, it's a new invention.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.267
- I can call you.
- Okay.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.951
- I'll text you, I promise.
- You look good.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.119
- No aches or pains or--
- No. I feel great.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.617
All right, okay, well,
I'm just sticking my head in.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.584
That's all.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.998
Uh...

21:58.100 --> 21:59.442
What?

21:59.550 --> 22:01.654
I was just gonna say
you could stay

22:01.760 --> 22:03.648
and hang out for a minute
if you want.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.101
Oh, really?

22:05.220 --> 22:07.381
I would love to.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.492
You okay?

22:09.600 --> 22:12.319
Yeah.

22:12.430 --> 22:15.490
Just, like...

22:15.610 --> 22:17.293
thinking about stuff.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.561
Yeah.
[chuckles]

22:20.780 --> 22:23.362
Uh,

22:23.480 --> 22:27.439
I am feeling bad
because...

22:27.550 --> 22:29.711
the other day,
you know,

22:29.830 --> 22:31.343
when I thought I was gonna
have the baby...

22:31.450 --> 22:33.998
[chuckles]

22:34.110 --> 22:35.372
When I found out
that I wasn't,

22:35.490 --> 22:39.449
I felt so relieved.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.484
I mean, I have a job
that pays me nothing

22:42.600 --> 22:45.353
and that's probably not
gonna last much longer,

22:45.460 --> 22:49.396
and I have no idea even
how to take care of myself,

22:49.500 --> 22:51.604
and I just--

22:51.710 --> 22:54.577
Something shifts.
You just have to trust me.

22:54.680 --> 22:58.571
Something shifts,
and you'll figure it out.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.022
[sighs]

23:00.130 --> 23:02.507
But what if I don't?

23:02.620 --> 23:07.648
What if--what if having
this baby was a mistake?

23:13.530 --> 23:17.523
When you hold the baby,

23:17.630 --> 23:20.076
something happens,

23:20.190 --> 23:23.489
and I can
almost guarantee you

23:23.600 --> 23:26.706
you won't feel like
it's a mistake then.

23:29.090 --> 23:30.603
[chuckles]

23:30.710 --> 23:34.646
How can you hold this thing
with that stomach?

23:38.550 --> 23:39.335
You're my hero.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.169
[chuckles]

23:42.280 --> 23:44.168
Go on.
[chuckles]

23:46.660 --> 23:47.695
G?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.449
G.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.529
[laughter]

23:55.570 --> 24:00.155
Yesterday a child
came out

24:00.260 --> 24:03.149
Into wonder

24:03.260 --> 24:05.125
Wonder or wander?

24:05.230 --> 24:08.165
Caught a dragonfly

24:08.270 --> 24:10.852
Inside a jar

24:13.450 --> 24:15.725
Fearful when the sky

24:15.830 --> 24:20.551
Was full of thunder

24:20.660 --> 24:27.077
And tearful at the falling
of a star

24:27.180 --> 24:28.249
Everybody.

24:28.360 --> 24:32.467
[both]
And the seasons,
they go round and round

24:32.570 --> 24:37.257
And the painted ponies
go up and down

24:37.370 --> 24:38.701
- We're captive
- C.

24:38.820 --> 24:41.266
[both]
On a carousel of

24:41.370 --> 24:42.291
G.

24:42.410 --> 24:45.538
Time

24:45.650 --> 24:47.094
[both]
We can't return

24:47.200 --> 24:52.069
We can only look behind
from where we came

24:52.180 --> 24:58.312
And go round and round
and round in the circle game

24:58.420 --> 25:01.969
-JonL
-VVhoo!

25:02.080 --> 25:07.632
Round and round and round
in the Circle game

25:07.740 --> 25:08.946
You still got it.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.984
[laughter]

25:11.090 --> 25:13.399
- Thank you, Detroit.
- [laughs]

25:13.510 --> 25:14.886
You were the original
little sulky girl.

25:14.990 --> 25:16.434
Yes, right,
I think you sulked nonstop

25:16.540 --> 25:18.474
from about 1992
to '94 maybe.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.377
Okay, forgive me
for ten years ago.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.515
She perked right up

25:21.620 --> 25:22.951
when Frank Gangi
came on the scene though.

25:23.070 --> 25:26.585
Oh, Gangi,
what a beautiful hairdo.

25:26.690 --> 25:28.339
"Mrs. Braverman,
is Julia home?"

25:28.450 --> 25:29.929
- Julia.
- I remember the teeth, I do.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.450
[Crosby]
He had a transplant
with a horse, right?

25:31.560 --> 25:32.629
That's how he ended up
with those?

25:32.730 --> 25:34.311
I remember all of it
about my first boyfriend.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.489
[Crosby]
And then, yeah, you brought--

25:35.600 --> 25:37.875
_ Whose name
is not Gangrene or Ganges

25:37.980 --> 25:38.878
or whatever
you guys called him.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.709
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Ganges, is it?

25:40.810 --> 25:42.323
- That's--
- [laughs]

25:42.430 --> 25:46.321
"Exactly is your intention with
my daughter with those teeth?"

25:46.440 --> 25:47.190
Wait a minute,
I didn't do that.

25:47.300 --> 25:50.428
- Yes, you did.
- And with a name like Gangi--

25:50.540 --> 25:51.609
- Scarier than normal.
- Oh, yeah.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.948
That was the same day
that Adam

25:53.060 --> 25:55.335
tried to kill you with a knife--
with a Swiss army knife.

25:55.450 --> 25:56.610
The same day my eldest brother

25:56.720 --> 25:57.755
stabbed me
with a Swiss Army knife.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.543
- Yeah.
- That's right. Yeah.

25:59.660 --> 26:01.207
You stabbed yourself
in the neck.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.823
- I didn't--
- Oh, sure, that happens a lot.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.555
- People stab themselves.
- Sticking to that story.

26:04.660 --> 26:05.627
If you hadn't stolen my knife
in the first place,

26:05.730 --> 26:07.595
none of it
would've ever happened.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.281
I was eight years old.
I was looking at it 'cause
I was a curious little kid.

26:09.390 --> 26:10.357
I told you to give it back.
You wouldn't give it back.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.870
_ Could've been
a little more generous.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.561
No, you stole it.
I asked you to put it down.

26:13.670 --> 26:14.420
You didn't ask me
to do anything.

26:14.530 --> 26:15.497
Yes, I did.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.659
- Oh!
- It was stolen from me.

26:17.780 --> 26:18.565
You guys,
you're holding actual knives.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.669
- Put 'em down.
- So I grabbed--

26:19.780 --> 26:21.008
- I let go.
- No. No, you didn't.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.609
You grabbed the knife
out of my hand...

26:22.710 --> 26:24.359
[arguing fades out]

26:24.470 --> 26:25.789
[Luke Sital-Singh's Benediction]

26:25.890 --> 26:29.644
Is it war if you fight it?

26:29.760 --> 26:33.514
Is it love when you don't?

26:33.620 --> 26:36.965
There is more
when you let go

26:37.070 --> 26:41.484
Of the fear
that you can't

26:41.600 --> 26:44.933
As we burn in the fire

26:45.050 --> 26:49.521
Slowly learning to breathe

26:49.640 --> 26:53.633
Just keep calm
in the falling

26:53.750 --> 26:55.559
Always looking

26:55.680 --> 26:57.602
For an underneath

26:57.710 --> 27:01.578
Hi.
Yeah, I'm coming back.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.854
I just--I needed to rest
a little bit here.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.612
I'm sorry
we don't have forever

27:08.730 --> 27:09.890
Ooh

27:10.000 --> 27:11.888
[sighs]

27:12.000 --> 27:13.695
That dumb knife fight,
right?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.416
Look, Sarah,
there's so much yelling.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.486
- It's just--
- [chuckles]

27:18.600 --> 27:21.182
[sighs]

27:26.640 --> 27:30.394
Hey, so...
[clears throat]

27:30.510 --> 27:33.468
Um...

27:33.580 --> 27:38.688
Hank proposed to me,

27:38.790 --> 27:40.644
and we're gonna get married.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.820
[both chuckle]

27:46.210 --> 27:48.007
[laughs]

27:48.110 --> 27:51.102
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

27:51.220 --> 27:54.280
Oh, baby.

27:54.390 --> 27:58.394
Oh, I can hardly wait
to walk you down the aisle,

27:58.500 --> 28:01.947
you know?

28:02.050 --> 28:04.462
Me too.
I can hardly wait.

28:04.570 --> 28:06.879
Yeah.

28:06.990 --> 28:11.097
But, baby,
I'm so proud of you.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.781
Okay?

28:12.890 --> 28:16.269
I'm sorry
we don't have forever

28:16.380 --> 28:18.132
Thanks, Dad.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.138
You're the best.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.108
Ooh

28:23.210 --> 28:24.142
Okay?

28:24.250 --> 28:27.105
[vocalizing]

28:34.020 --> 28:35.419
[door opens]

28:37.570 --> 28:39.253
[Joel]
You're home late.

28:39.370 --> 28:41.019
Yeah.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.916
Traffic on the bridge
was horrendous.

28:43.030 --> 28:44.986
How was
the big sibling-only dinner?

28:51.100 --> 28:53.068
[sighs]

28:53.170 --> 28:56.628
Dad's not having the surgery.

28:56.730 --> 28:57.799
I don't know.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.973
He decided
it's too risky or something.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.968
[whispers]
I don't know.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.288
Maybe he'll change his mind.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.561
[sighs]

29:09.670 --> 29:10.534
I don't think so.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.768
Ah, Zeek.

29:13.890 --> 29:15.881
[Roo Panes]
Like I never run

29:15.990 --> 29:18.675
Try like I never tried

29:18.790 --> 29:19.677
Fight like I never fought

29:19.790 --> 29:21.576
We have to talk
about our stuff.

29:21.690 --> 29:24.853
We have to talk
about my job and Chris.

29:24.970 --> 29:28.417
Okay.
I just don't want 'em--

29:28.520 --> 29:29.930
You saw how upset Victor was.

29:30.040 --> 29:30.938
I don't want to argue.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.076
I don't want 'em
to hear us argumg.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.147
I just--

29:34.250 --> 29:36.241
Okay. I don't--
I don't know.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.453
We can't just let it fester.
We have to get it out.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.947
I don't want to argue.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.187
You understand?

29:45.300 --> 29:47.120
I don't want to--
I just moved back.

29:47.230 --> 29:49.221
I don't want to bring that back
into this house.

29:49.330 --> 29:53.027
I'm too--I'm too scared
to argue.

29:53.130 --> 29:56.429
Well, I'm too scared
not to argue.

29:56.550 --> 29:57.994
I'm always saying

29:58.100 --> 30:01.160
[Joel]
I just--
I hate--I hate

30:01.280 --> 30:02.861
that you still
work with that guy.

30:02.970 --> 30:03.959
[Julia]
Okay, but it's over.
It is like--

30:04.070 --> 30:05.697
I think
you think it's over.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.653
It is over for me--

30:06.770 --> 30:07.691
The guy is
a totally different beast.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.721
You have to trust me.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.727
Any time
you're in a situation like that,

30:09.840 --> 30:11.102
it's gonna keep coming up.

30:11.220 --> 30:12.005
You don't want to quit my job,
and we agreed to that.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.690
I'm not asking you
to stop being a lawyer.

30:13.810 --> 30:15.141
I was unemployed
for so long.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.046
That was so humiliating for me.
It was so--

30:17.160 --> 30:18.730
You can stay working
at this job

30:18.850 --> 30:19.703
while you look
for another job.

30:19.810 --> 30:20.947
- That's--
- [groans]

30:21.060 --> 30:23.949
Joel, so we have to reevaluate
everything right now?

30:24.060 --> 30:25.641
I'm getting adjusted
to this.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.024
- Like, I had no idea.
- This is--

30:27.130 --> 30:28.859
Several men sleeping in my bed
while I was gone.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.881
Zero. There were zero.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.160
I'm asking you
to be sensitive.

30:31.270 --> 30:31.998
If you found out that
I'd slept with multiple women,

30:32.100 --> 30:33.135
- and all of a sudden--
- [groans]

30:33.240 --> 30:35.401
Joel, I would be very hurt
by it, of course,

30:35.520 --> 30:36.964
but I trust you
because I love you.

30:37.070 --> 30:38.446
- Yes, and I love you.
- I know.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.312
[conversation fades]

30:40.420 --> 30:43.105
Made me want it

30:48.360 --> 30:50.976
- [knocking] Hey, buddy.
- Max?

30:51.090 --> 30:53.945
Can we talk to you
for a quick sec?

30:54.050 --> 30:56.257
What you reading?

30:56.370 --> 30:58.122
Hey, can we put
the book away?

30:58.230 --> 30:59.982
Oh.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.650
Max, let's just close that
for a second, okay?

31:02.750 --> 31:04.126
- It's kind of important.
- We're just gonna talk to you.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.789
Dad and I want to talk to you
about a couple things.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.926
So Dad actually told me
what you said

31:11.040 --> 31:13.065
about that stupid 85% statistic,

31:13.180 --> 31:14.169
which is just
a bunch of garbage.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.247
Statistics are neither stupid
nor smart.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.625
- Well, it's garbage.
- They're only accurate.

31:17.730 --> 31:20.005
And we want to tell you
what we see for your future

31:20.110 --> 31:21.907
because I think that's
a little bit more accurate,

31:22.010 --> 31:22.908
to be honest with you.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.329
You're not a number.
You're a person.

31:24.430 --> 31:26.898
It's impossible.
You can't see the future.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.807
In a way, we can, Max.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.674
We can
because we've watched you--

31:33.780 --> 31:36.123
we've watched you grow--
grow.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.198
Yup, and we're very proud
of what we see.

31:38.310 --> 31:40.813
And in so many amazing,
amazing ways.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.478
And you are so--

31:43.590 --> 31:45.444
you're so talented,

31:45.550 --> 31:47.029
and you're smart.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.131
- Mm-hmm.
- You're funny, and--

31:49.250 --> 31:50.729
And you're interested
in so many things.

31:50.830 --> 31:53.412
Passionate about history
and photography--

31:53.530 --> 31:54.451
- Beautiful photography.
- Photography work.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.869
In your extremely
subjective opinion,

31:56.980 --> 31:59.869
you believe
that someday in some capacity

31:59.980 --> 32:02.187
I will be employable
by someone somewhere.

32:02.290 --> 32:03.291
[chuckles]

32:03.400 --> 32:04.913
That's part
of what we're trying

32:05.020 --> 32:06.226
to say to you, absolutely.

32:06.330 --> 32:07.979
I think you're gonna be
more than employable, honey.

32:08.090 --> 32:08.954
- You're gonna be--
- You might be employing others.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.220
You're gonna be
a superstar.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.023
Open your own photography
studio--You already are.

32:12.130 --> 32:15.611
And Dad and I can't_wait
to go on this journey With you.

32:19.690 --> 32:21.134
Is this getting through, Max?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.377
You're not limited
by anything.

32:22.490 --> 32:25.209
Can I go back
to reading my book now?

32:25.320 --> 32:26.969
Yeah.

32:27.080 --> 32:27.933
I think you're gonna
be all right.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.553
We love you.

32:29.670 --> 32:32.070
We've got you, buddy, okay?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.532
I love you.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.914
I don't like this.

32:43.030 --> 32:47.262
I know, but sometimes
you got to suck it up.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.870
Look at you working away.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.218
What?

33:16.330 --> 33:20.027
Like, you're just giving them
such nice attention.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.745
Yeah, well, you got to.

33:21.860 --> 33:25.159
Um, that's what
the problem is.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.966
People don't, and it's like
throwing money out the window.

33:28.070 --> 33:32.029
Especially these--
these are--

33:32.140 --> 33:37.032
these are the top,
so you got to give 'em good--

33:37.150 --> 33:39.732
you can't just let 'em go.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.661
- Mm.
- That would be stupid.

33:48.710 --> 33:49.563
You okay?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.057
Mm-hmm.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.572
I've just been thinking.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.920
[sighs]

33:56.030 --> 33:57.054
I don't want you
to be disappointed,

33:57.170 --> 34:00.059
but I really just want
to get married here.

34:00.170 --> 34:03.298
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna be disappointed.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.411
We can get married around here.
You know the--

34:05.520 --> 34:08.967
in the Napa Valley area, there's
some good landscapes there that,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.456
you know, at the golden hour--

34:10.560 --> 34:12.528
But, Hank, you know,
I feel like

34:12.630 --> 34:17.738
I really want to do it
here in San Francisco and soon.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.013
Like, next week.
I just--

34:20.120 --> 34:20.870
- Next week?
- Mm-hmm.

34:20.980 --> 34:24.359
I...

34:24.470 --> 34:27.598
I just want
to make sure that, um...

34:33.070 --> 34:35.709
That my dad is there.

34:35.830 --> 34:36.751
[sighs]

34:39.110 --> 34:41.965
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.206
Yeah, we don't have
to go anywhere.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.620
No, I want your dad there too.

34:47.740 --> 34:49.048
We'll do it next week.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.833
Okay.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.874
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there.

34:54.980 --> 34:58.120
Don't worry about it.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.219
Don't cry.
I don't--

35:00.330 --> 35:04.983
I don't like
when you cry.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.055
We'll get pictures
of everybody.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.138
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.514
I can get rid of those.

35:17.630 --> 35:19.211
Don't.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.621
It's looking
really good, Edgar.

35:24.740 --> 35:26.423
- All right.
- You want to pour it in?

35:26.530 --> 35:27.497
All right.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.842
Is it really true
about the 85%?

35:30.950 --> 35:34.602
Oh, Edgar, I don't want you
to worry about what Max said.

35:34.710 --> 35:37.645
But what if
I suck at cooking?

35:37.750 --> 35:38.500
Then what?

35:38.610 --> 35:40.544
How will I find something
that I love?

35:40.650 --> 35:42.265
Well, you just
keep searching.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.472
Sometimes,
it's a long journey,

35:43.580 --> 35:46.037
and sometimes
your career finds you.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.653
You know, there are people
who figure out

35:47.760 --> 35:49.625
what they want to do at a really
young age like my brother.

35:49.730 --> 35:50.480
And other people are 45,

35:50.590 --> 35:52.148
still don't know
what they want to do.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.901
How'd you find your passion?

35:57.530 --> 35:59.566
You know, I'll let you know
when it happens.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.730
Okay.

36:02.850 --> 36:03.498
It looks good.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.602
- Ready to set that timer?
- Yup.

36:05.710 --> 36:06.802
All right.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.911
Timer set.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.784
All right, and now...

36:11.890 --> 36:14.097
- We wait.
- We wait.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.067
[timer ticking]

36:17.170 --> 36:19.991
[gentle piano music]

36:23.870 --> 36:32.801

36:44.090 --> 36:53.715
[Aaron Neville]
Ave Maria

36:57.280 --> 37:00.135
[singing in Latin]

37:50.090 --> 37:51.671
Oh, my God.

37:51.780 --> 37:52.599
Yes!

37:52.710 --> 37:54.291
- Shh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

37:54.410 --> 37:55.957
Easy, easy.

37:56.060 --> 38:09.724
Ave Maria

38:09.830 --> 38:12.697
[vocalizing]

38:28.890 --> 38:36.262
Amen

38:36.380 --> 38:38.723
[gaSPSI

38:38.830 --> 38:41.037
Oh, God.

38:41.140 --> 38:44.769
[groans]

38:44.870 --> 38:46.451
Oh, my God.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.666
[phone ringing]

38:53.770 --> 38:55.658
- Hi.
- Mom, it's happening.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.566
It's happening. It's real.
It's real this time.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.329
Okay, baby. Okay, I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.886
It really hurts. Mom, Mom, Mom,
don't tell anybody else, okay?

39:01.990 --> 39:04.367
Okay, I won't tell anybody,
and it'll be just me.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.674
Okay, just you and me.

39:05.790 --> 39:07.508
- Okay, please hurry, okay.
- Okay, I love you.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.167
- Keep breathing.
- I love you, okay.

39:09.270 --> 39:10.441
Okay, I got to go.
She wants just me.

39:10.550 --> 39:11.471
Just--yeah? All right.

39:11.590 --> 39:13.546
I'll be okay.

39:13.660 --> 39:16.128
Send me a picture
of the baby.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.205
[Jos Gonzlez]
Every age

39:17.320 --> 39:19.242
[breathing heavily]

39:19.350 --> 39:22.558
Has its turn

39:22.670 --> 39:28.779
Every branch of the tree
has to learn

39:31.610 --> 39:35.467
Find its way

39:35.580 --> 39:41.507
Make the best
of this short-lived stay

39:41.620 --> 39:44.544
Take the seed

39:44.650 --> 39:48.165
Take this spade

39:48.280 --> 39:54.207
Take this dream
of a better day

39:54.320 --> 39:57.380
Take your time

39:57.490 --> 40:00.971
Build a home

40:01.080 --> 40:02.399
Build a place

40:02.500 --> 40:05.731
Where we all can belong

40:13.300 --> 40:15.712
[screaming]

40:15.820 --> 40:18.539
Some things change

40:18.650 --> 40:22.234
Some remain

40:22.350 --> 40:26.821
Some will pass us
unnoticed by

40:28.700 --> 40:31.453
What to focus on

40:31.560 --> 40:35.382
To improve upon

40:35.500 --> 40:41.257
In the face
of our ancient tribes

40:41.360 --> 40:44.363
Feels so clear

40:44.470 --> 40:48.429
Feels so obvious

40:48.540 --> 40:54.137
To each one on their own

40:54.240 --> 40:57.038
But we live

40:57.140 --> 41:01.509
Together

41:01.630 --> 41:06.624
Reaping what time
and what we

41:06.740 --> 41:07.559
Have sown

41:07.670 --> 41:09.763
- Hel_lo.
- Hi.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.326
New mommy.

41:12.430 --> 41:13.567
- Amber's a mommy.
- He's pretty beautiful.

41:13.670 --> 41:16.423
[Amber]
Little goofball.

41:16.540 --> 41:17.359
[Camille]
[965%]
Oh, he's perfect.

41:17.470 --> 41:20.121
Oh, my God.

41:20.230 --> 41:25.645
I want you to meet
your great grandson, Zeek.

41:25.750 --> 41:31.757
We don't choose
in what pocket or form

41:31.860 --> 41:34.488
[chuckles]

41:34.590 --> 41:35.625
Learn to know

41:35.730 --> 41:37.516
- You want to hold him?
- Yeah.

41:37.630 --> 41:40.349
Ourselves on this

41:40.460 --> 41:42.428
Oh, hi.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.453
Take this mind

41:46.570 --> 41:47.491
Hi, Zeek.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.113
Take this pen

41:49.230 --> 41:50.879
Okay.

41:50.990 --> 41:56.337
Take this dream
of a better land

41:56.440 --> 42:00.262
You're beautiful.

42:00.370 --> 42:01.439
[mouths word]

42:03.930 --> 42:09.960
Build a place
where we all

42:10.070 --> 42:11.583
Can belong

42:46.320 --> 42:48.208
[dog barks]
