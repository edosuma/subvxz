00:03.843 --> 00:05.810
Ho, ho, ho!

00:10.960 --> 00:12.926
Happy birthday.

D'oh!

01:01.764 --> 01:04.065
Merry Christmas!

01:23.686 --> 01:27.221
Another Thanksgiving is in the books.

01:27.257 --> 01:29.624
Which means Christmas is starting.

01:29.659 --> 01:33.060
Say, Lis, I couldn't help but notice
you're holding a piece of paper.

01:33.096 --> 01:34.629
Oh, this piece of paper?

01:34.664 --> 01:36.998
Why, it's just my
Christmas list, is all.

01:37.033 --> 01:38.299
What a coincidence.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.835
I also have my Christmas list
right here in my hand.

01:40.870 --> 01:42.937
Oh, you selfish little gangsters.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.839
There's always another
shakedown, isn't there?

01:44.874 --> 01:48.242
What do you know, Bart? There's
only one present on my list.

01:48.278 --> 01:50.111
My word, that's reasonable.

01:50.146 --> 01:52.947
I, too, only found one present
to be list-worthy.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.283
Oh, give me the lists.

01:57.187 --> 01:58.819
We already have a TV.

01:58.855 --> 02:00.488
We've been through ten Super Bowls,

02:00.523 --> 02:02.757
XLIV through LIII.

02:02.792 --> 02:05.593
But our dumb TV is not a smart TV.

02:05.628 --> 02:08.996
And I just want one other
smart thing in this house.

02:09.032 --> 02:10.798
Yeah, well, we'll think about it.

02:15.305 --> 02:17.972
I want everything about
Christmas to be perfect,

02:18.007 --> 02:23.010
but that smart TV
the kids want is $2,400.

02:23.046 --> 02:24.612
That's ridiculous.

02:24.647 --> 02:27.815
Our TV may not be smart,
but it's street smart.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.484
It's Sprawl-Mart's
huge Black Friday sale.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.353
Jay-G headphones only $49.99.

02:32.388 --> 02:34.855
Two-piece sofa set only $249.99.

02:34.891 --> 02:39.827
And this GL50 9K Smart TV only $499.99.

02:39.862 --> 02:43.564
GL50 9K Smart TV.
Where have I heard that before?

02:43.600 --> 02:45.833
The kids are chanting it nonstop.

02:45.868 --> 02:48.803
GL50 9K Smart TV.

02:48.838 --> 02:53.140
- GL50 9K Smart TV.
- Knock it off!

02:53.176 --> 02:54.342
Supplies are limited,

02:54.377 --> 02:56.410
so be here when the doors open
at 6:00 a.m.!

02:56.446 --> 02:58.746
Black Friday: like The Purge,
but for bargains.

02:58.781 --> 03:01.148
That's how we get it. We have to go.

03:01.184 --> 03:04.151
Oh, old TV, you really are dumb.

03:04.187 --> 03:07.321
You just told us how to replace you.

03:07.357 --> 03:10.825
Why do we have an antenna on an HDTV?

03:10.860 --> 03:12.393
I thought it looked cool.

03:14.464 --> 03:16.931
So the customers
will be entering from here,

03:16.966 --> 03:18.232
here and here.

03:18.268 --> 03:20.668
Our biggest concern are the cutsies.

03:20.703 --> 03:23.537
- I hate those Nazis.
- I said "cutsies."

03:23.573 --> 03:26.507
- You think the Nazis didn't take cuts?
- Oh.

03:26.542 --> 03:29.944
I leave for Sprawl-Mart now,
getting us a good place in line.

03:29.979 --> 03:33.447
And I go to sleep now, waking up
in the middle of the night,

03:33.483 --> 03:35.349
rested and ready to relieve you

03:35.385 --> 03:37.051
- at 3:00 a.m.
- That's right.

03:37.086 --> 03:40.021
Godspeed, hot woman.

03:44.727 --> 03:47.928
I love you, too, Homie,
but I have to go.

03:47.964 --> 03:51.632
My tongue is frozen to your zipper.

04:00.243 --> 04:03.044
Aw, Marge, great to see you out here.

04:03.079 --> 04:05.646
You want a Cup O' Noodles
to chase away the chill?

04:05.682 --> 04:08.115
- How sweet.
- It's just water.

04:08.151 --> 04:09.750
I can't afford the real thing,

04:09.786 --> 04:12.053
but if you stare at the label
while you drink it,

04:12.088 --> 04:14.922
you'd swear there was real
chicken powder in there.

04:14.957 --> 04:18.492
Oh.

04:18.528 --> 04:21.228
What bargain are you busting
down the door for?

04:21.264 --> 04:24.799
I'm getting a Futon Friend
for my granddaughter.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.568
I want her to remember me
as more than just a grandpa

04:27.603 --> 04:28.769
who lives at the airport.

04:28.805 --> 04:31.105
The trick is to carry
a piece of empty luggage

04:31.140 --> 04:33.007
because then they... they...

04:45.621 --> 04:47.855
Sorry, Ralphie, it's just too cold.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.757
Even my blubber isn't helping.

04:49.792 --> 04:52.493
Cold in the winter, hot in the summer.

04:52.528 --> 04:55.296
Why did I grow you?

04:56.999 --> 04:59.934
Oh, your hands feel cold.
Let me look at them.

04:59.969 --> 05:03.771
Whoa, that's toasty! Am in Ipanema?

05:06.476 --> 05:08.342
Hmm? Hmm?

05:09.912 --> 05:11.946
I can do this. It's 2:30.

05:11.981 --> 05:13.781
Homer's gonna be here any minute.

05:20.423 --> 05:22.223
What?

05:26.596 --> 05:27.828
What the...?

05:28.898 --> 05:31.165
Ooh, got to relieve Marge!

05:41.511 --> 05:44.412
My hands are starting to freeze.

05:44.447 --> 05:46.480
I hope Homer gets here soon.

05:46.516 --> 05:48.682
Why are we standing?

05:48.718 --> 05:51.218
We still have hours
before the store opens.

05:51.254 --> 05:52.586
To keep out the cutters.

05:52.622 --> 05:54.555
Ow! You're punching me in the back.

05:54.590 --> 05:55.756
I ain't doin' it.

05:55.792 --> 05:58.025
It's the baby what's in my belly
thrashing about.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.894
If you go into labor,
I'll help you deliver,

05:59.929 --> 06:02.563
but then that baby has to go
to the back of the line.

06:02.598 --> 06:04.598
Yeah!

06:04.634 --> 06:08.035
I know how to hold a baby in.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.910
Have a safe Black Friday,

06:15.945 --> 06:18.913
and welcome to Thunderdome.

06:29.559 --> 06:32.059
My hands are frozen,

06:32.128 --> 06:36.096
which makes it easier to do this.

06:41.404 --> 06:43.237
The electronics department.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.738
I'm going to make it.

06:44.774 --> 06:46.307
I'm not gonna make it!

06:48.744 --> 06:52.713
Is there one drop of humanity
in this big-box store?

06:54.417 --> 06:56.550
Don't look, Marge.
At any other time of year,

06:56.586 --> 06:59.220
that man's life would be worth
more than a TV,

06:59.255 --> 07:00.821
but not at Christmas.

07:00.857 --> 07:04.458
Tell my granddaughter I existed.

07:33.022 --> 07:35.189
This will help raise the little one.

07:45.034 --> 07:46.600
You did it, Marge.

07:46.636 --> 07:50.104
You've given a poor old man
the greatest gift of all,

07:50.139 --> 07:53.040
- a grandchild's love.
- Well, that makes it all...

07:53.075 --> 07:54.508
I can't leave without one of those.

07:54.544 --> 07:56.176
I'll give you a hundred bucks for it.

07:56.212 --> 07:58.512
- Can't say no to that.
- Oh...

08:03.085 --> 08:07.788
Oh! Marge, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to let you down.

08:07.823 --> 08:10.958
I'm not mad at you. I won't
let myself be mad at you.

08:10.993 --> 08:14.194
This is Christmas, and Christmas
is great for our kids,

08:14.230 --> 08:16.363
and I vow on my life

08:16.399 --> 08:18.632
to make it a great Christmas.

08:18.668 --> 08:20.034
I totally agree.

08:20.069 --> 08:23.337
Now because you've been
through so much, let me drive.

08:27.610 --> 08:31.355
Let me call you an Uber.

08:37.671 --> 08:40.171
So I'm afraid you won't be getting

08:40.240 --> 08:42.207
the smart TV for Christmas.

08:42.241 --> 08:43.707
We figured.

08:43.744 --> 08:45.877
Never get your hopes up around here.

08:45.912 --> 08:49.848
But I promise you, Christmas
will be better than ever.

08:49.883 --> 08:51.750
I'll sweep that up, sweetie.

08:54.688 --> 08:57.255
Your mother froze her fingers

08:57.290 --> 08:59.057
trying to get a Christmas gift for you,

08:59.092 --> 09:00.825
and what were you going to give her?

09:00.861 --> 09:02.994
- Lanyard.
- Poem.

09:03.030 --> 09:04.429
I thought as much.

09:04.464 --> 09:07.242
Well, we're gonna make this
Christmas about your mother.

09:07.309 --> 09:09.742
- But Christmas is for kids.
- Her.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.945
Hi, guys, it's Monica here

09:11.980 --> 09:13.913
with five easy hacks for resetting

09:13.949 --> 09:15.582
your threshold Christmas caroler.

09:15.617 --> 09:18.985
Number one, locate the P.I.X.
input on the pressure strip.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.621
I already did that, Monica.

09:24.025 --> 09:25.358
I think I've got it.

09:25.393 --> 09:28.595
What if we take Mom on a Florida
vacation for Christmas?

09:28.630 --> 09:30.530
Hoy, hoy, hoy.

09:30.565 --> 09:32.432
I ride on a pig.

09:32.467 --> 09:35.702
Don't forget to leave me porridge!

09:35.737 --> 09:38.304
Ugh, I've got it set on Norwegian.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.039
Well, at least we're
not planning a vacation

09:40.075 --> 09:43.209
at the last second, we're
planning at the last minute.

09:43.244 --> 09:45.545
Can't afford Nine Flags Underwater,

09:45.580 --> 09:47.513
Yankees Fantasy Camp,

09:47.549 --> 09:49.482
Yankees Suck Fantasy Camp...

09:49.517 --> 09:52.151
Oh, my God, there's a place
we can afford.

09:52.187 --> 09:54.554
I've never heard of it.

09:54.589 --> 09:57.323
How can we be sure
it's what it seems in the ad?

09:57.392 --> 09:59.359
That's a good point.
On the other hand...

09:59.394 --> 10:01.060
only three rooms left!

10:01.096 --> 10:03.496
And 58 people are looking at them.

10:03.531 --> 10:05.632
All right, kids, let this be a lesson.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.134
You should never succumb to something

10:08.169 --> 10:09.802
just because you are pressured to...

10:09.838 --> 10:11.471
One room left!

10:11.506 --> 10:14.674
I got it! Full price,
nonrefundable! Boom!

10:17.912 --> 10:20.213
Christmas is on me. Christmas is on me.

10:20.248 --> 10:22.882
Marge, darling, remember when we agreed

10:22.917 --> 10:24.917
you should take it down a few notches?

10:24.953 --> 10:27.387
Yeah, the notches.
Always with the notches.

10:27.422 --> 10:29.022
Marge, have you considered

10:29.057 --> 10:31.324
that we could spend Christmas
somewhere else?

10:31.359 --> 10:32.425
Home.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.494
If it's not home, it's not Christmas.

10:34.529 --> 10:36.429
Home, home, home!

10:36.464 --> 10:38.431
We're gonna have to take her out cold.

10:53.581 --> 10:54.714
You're getting one little...

10:54.749 --> 10:56.349
sleeve and there you go.

10:56.384 --> 10:58.184
- Mom?
- Yes, Lisa? Yes?

10:58.219 --> 11:00.353
- That's not our cat.
- Damn it.

11:01.556 --> 11:04.524
Mom, we came to sing some carols.

11:04.559 --> 11:07.593
And I'll pour the tea.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.591
- We're in Tennessee.
- Tennessee?

11:38.626 --> 11:40.426
We packed all the luggage ourselves.

11:40.462 --> 11:42.261
After all that you've been through,

11:42.297 --> 11:45.264
this Christmas is about you.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.266
The warm air helped my hands.

11:47.302 --> 11:49.469
I like Tennessee.

11:49.504 --> 11:51.137
That's fantastic.

11:51.172 --> 11:52.772
However, we just entered Georgia.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.774
Change the bumper sticker, boy.

11:56.945 --> 11:59.612
Dirty Birds! You got that right!

11:59.647 --> 12:01.981
Yeah! Go, area team!

12:12.360 --> 12:14.761
Enjoying the sunshine?

12:14.829 --> 12:17.363
That's the Christmas gift
we get all year long.

12:17.398 --> 12:19.365
Can we please get to our room?

12:19.400 --> 12:22.435
We just drove 2,000 miles in four hours.

12:22.504 --> 12:24.137
Of course.

12:24.172 --> 12:27.540
And thank you for reminding me
why I never had kids.

12:27.575 --> 12:30.243
Let's go, shall we?

12:34.182 --> 12:37.049
All of us in this one little room?

12:37.085 --> 12:38.484
I call sleeping in the bathtub!

12:38.520 --> 12:40.153
I want to sleep in the bathtub.

12:40.188 --> 12:42.855
There's no bathtub.
Just a combo shower and toilet.

12:42.891 --> 12:44.323
We call it a shoilet.

12:44.359 --> 12:46.726
Well, the fun is outside.

12:48.029 --> 12:51.330
Ooh, that's gonna be a big one.

12:51.366 --> 12:55.368
Oh, I don't know how we're gonna
give you kids a Christmas.

12:55.403 --> 12:58.738
Dad, Bart, meet me in the shoilet.

12:58.773 --> 13:01.174
D'oh!

13:01.209 --> 13:03.342
Let me tell you something
about your mother.

13:03.378 --> 13:07.413
She is always as happy
as the saddest one of us.

13:07.448 --> 13:09.682
I'm not always the saddest one.

13:09.717 --> 13:12.552
Polar bears are dying.

13:12.587 --> 13:15.188
Oh, that's so sad.

13:15.223 --> 13:18.591
So, rain or shine, we will
all have smiles on our faces.

13:18.626 --> 13:21.861
Her mood will be based
on the signals we are giving.

13:21.896 --> 13:23.062
All hands in.

13:23.131 --> 13:25.431
Okay, three, two, one...

13:25.466 --> 13:27.333
Fake enthusiasm.

13:27.368 --> 13:29.068
What are you guys doing in here?

13:29.103 --> 13:30.703
Uh, having a great time.

13:30.738 --> 13:32.505
That's about to get better.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.208
Really?

13:35.243 --> 13:37.610
Who wants room service?

13:42.750 --> 13:46.018
This is cool. Cartoon characters
no one's ever heard of.

13:46.054 --> 13:49.722
That's Mulberry Mutt, Tremendous
Boar and Thelonious Skunk.

13:49.757 --> 13:52.425
- Does somebody want a hug?
- No.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.228
- Oh, I think you do.
- Really, I don't.

13:55.263 --> 13:56.963
Hug the bull, boy.

13:56.998 --> 14:00.967
That's right, kid. Legally,
you have to initiate it.

14:04.005 --> 14:06.806
That's so sweet.

14:16.184 --> 14:18.985
You know, they say whenever
you travel, it grows your brain.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.120
This place is fantastic.

14:21.155 --> 14:22.755
This place is a dump.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.057
I picked it!
If you criticize this place,

14:25.093 --> 14:26.626
you're criticizing me!

14:26.661 --> 14:28.728
Well, in that case,
this place is a loser

14:28.763 --> 14:30.496
with a gambling problem.

14:30.531 --> 14:33.232
That's the worst thing
the kids could possibly hear.

14:33.268 --> 14:36.102
I won once, when I met you.

14:36.137 --> 14:37.603
Aw...

14:37.639 --> 14:39.939
Come here.

14:41.943 --> 14:44.243
Oh, for God's sake. I'll stop this.

14:49.817 --> 14:53.286
Get this over with quick!
There's kids next door!

14:53.321 --> 14:54.954
There's kids in here, too!

14:59.727 --> 15:02.528
Makes you feel kind of
lonely, doesn't it?

15:02.563 --> 15:05.531
- Yeah.
- Well, it all starts with a hug.

15:05.566 --> 15:07.967
You want a hug?

15:10.305 --> 15:11.470
Aw...

15:25.477 --> 15:27.877
Oh, boy. You kids are up early.

15:27.912 --> 15:30.013
Bart and I are going
to engage in perhaps

15:30.048 --> 15:33.616
the most popular Florida tradition...

15:33.652 --> 15:36.386
complaining to the manager.

15:36.421 --> 15:39.856
Hey, come on in.

15:39.924 --> 15:43.092
This place is nothing
like it looked on the Internet.

15:43.128 --> 15:45.094
We can't compete with the big boys.

15:45.130 --> 15:48.731
Disney's already laying ground
for a new Family Guy World.

15:48.767 --> 15:51.134
♪ Lucky there's a family guy... ♪

15:51.169 --> 15:55.071
I was the "it" boy in 2006.

15:55.106 --> 15:57.194
I don't know when and I don't know how,

15:57.222 --> 16:00.823
but I am gonna get you.

16:00.858 --> 16:05.194
Well, at least something
in this place is clean now.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.164
That was the most horrifying ride

16:08.199 --> 16:09.832
I've ever been on.

16:11.669 --> 16:14.170
Where's Maggie?

16:23.448 --> 16:27.883
Oh, this is so much fun.
You know how I love history.

16:27.919 --> 16:32.054
It's like looking at a rogues
gallery of America's villains.

16:32.090 --> 16:35.591
According to the soundtrack to
Hamilton, you were a real jerk.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.362
Vice presidents rule!

16:39.397 --> 16:42.398
Aw. Are you really having a great time?

16:43.501 --> 16:47.036
Really? Because I sure as heck am not.

16:47.071 --> 16:51.407
No, I'm FaceTiming Milhouse
'cause it's more fun.

16:51.442 --> 16:53.042
Whassup?

16:53.077 --> 16:54.543
Milhouse, give me something.

16:54.579 --> 16:56.746
I'm trapped in The Hall
of Vice Presidents.

16:56.781 --> 17:00.283
Well, I'm kind of
the vice president of us.

17:00.318 --> 17:01.851
Got to go.

17:01.886 --> 17:04.353
And we've got to go. Back home.

17:04.388 --> 17:06.388
We can be in Springfield by Christmas

17:06.424 --> 17:08.958
if we can just get our money back.

17:08.992 --> 17:11.426
Leave that to me.

17:28.613 --> 17:30.946
I shot my best friend in the face.

17:51.636 --> 17:55.104
There it is, the first snow.

17:55.139 --> 17:57.473
It smells so clean.

18:20.865 --> 18:23.132
Oh, my God.

18:23.167 --> 18:26.469
Moe serves Christmas dinner
to the old and needy.

18:28.339 --> 18:31.540
Yeah, look, it's the one
nice thing I do. Ha.

18:31.576 --> 18:33.376
Guess old Moe's got a heart.

18:33.411 --> 18:36.645
Also, if I turn the rummy away,
they might wind up in church.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.047
That could turn their life around.

18:38.082 --> 18:39.882
That's bad for business.

18:39.917 --> 18:43.986
Moe, I never dreamed you were
capable of such a sweet thing.

18:44.021 --> 18:46.355
Oh, no... I beg you,
don't make a moment out of this.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.157
Oh.

18:48.192 --> 18:51.527
Ha. You missed my tongue there,
but, eh, that's all right.

18:54.332 --> 18:57.199
Everyone, please close your eyes.

18:57.235 --> 18:59.468
Boy, you do the honors.

18:59.504 --> 19:02.304
Dear Lord, we didn't get
the gift we wanted,

19:02.340 --> 19:04.106
a GL50 9K Smart TV.

19:04.142 --> 19:05.841
The place we went was a dump.

19:05.877 --> 19:07.877
But isn't Christmas really about

19:07.912 --> 19:10.379
being with your family
and your bartender?

19:10.415 --> 19:12.314
We have traveled many miles to learn

19:12.350 --> 19:15.151
there's no place like Moe's.

19:15.186 --> 19:17.653
Amen.

19:20.024 --> 19:23.392
If you're not going
to buy something, leave.

19:26.501 --> 19:29.688
Bart, I disrespected you and I'm sorry.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.703
I've refunded your money plus $2,400

19:32.739 --> 19:36.307
if you pledge to never come here again.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.043
And please tell
your sister she's pretty.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.679
Not Lisa, the baby.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.581
You can't win in Florida.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.583
Oh, my God, why don't
your batteries die?

19:45.618 --> 19:48.319
I have a solar head.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.022
Well, you'll be happy to know

19:51.057 --> 19:52.723
we've put the money to good use.

19:52.759 --> 19:57.595
Now, to celebrate Christmas
the way our ancestors did.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.000
You know, there's a real log
burning below it, right?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.603
Yeah, but is it HD?
