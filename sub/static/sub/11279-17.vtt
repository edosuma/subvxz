It's so good
seeing you, girl.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.151
You take care.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.619
You owe me
some Kleenex.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.388
See you later, thanks for
all the chicken and things.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.491
All right, and stay out
of them pretzels. Bye.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.826
So...

18:12.859 --> 18:14.260
[SIGHS]

18:14.294 --> 18:16.429
Did he say anything
before he died?

18:16.463 --> 18:17.797
Who, Daddy?

18:17.831 --> 18:19.399
No, Martin Luther King.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.302
Yes, your father.
Did he mention me?

18:22.335 --> 18:25.238
No, he just asked
for more pork chops.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.408
NARRATOR:
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>
<i>"She should have lied."</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:30.744
<i>But actually,</i>
<i>the truth was better.</i>

18:30.777 --> 18:32.212
Figures.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.281
I liked the flowers.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.418
You liked them?
I guess so.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.454
NARRATOR:
<i>I know that doesn't seem</i>
<i>like much of an apology</i>

18:41.488 --> 18:43.289
<i>after everything</i>
<i>that's happened,</i>

18:43.323 --> 18:45.458
<i>but here's what</i>
<i>she really meant to say...</i>

18:45.492 --> 18:48.661
Baby, I am
so proud of you.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.929
I know.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.798
You are doing
a wonderful job.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.266
I know!

18:53.299 --> 18:55.335
I wish my no-good son
would stand up for me

18:55.368 --> 18:57.537
the way your son
stood up for you.
I know!

18:57.570 --> 19:01.207
And your father--
Oh, he would be so proud of you.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.542
I know!

19:02.575 --> 19:04.644
Well, Mama,
why are you so damn mean?

19:04.678 --> 19:06.212
I don't know.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.915
And baby, your hair,
it don't stink.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.817
I know.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.253
See you around.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.855
Take care, Mama.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.191
[***]

19:19.826 --> 19:21.261
That's all of it.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.929
Oh, thank you, baby.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.765
I'm really going
to miss him, Mom.

19:25.799 --> 19:29.235
Me too, Chris.
Me too.

19:30.370 --> 19:34.240
Chris, get in here
and pick up this yo-yo!

19:34.274 --> 19:35.975
My father died,
for goodness sake,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.478
and now you're trying
to kill me too!

19:39.479 --> 19:44.751
<i>* Everybody hates Chris </i>

19:46.419 --> 19:48.521
[***]

19:49.956 --> 19:53.393
<i>* Aw, make it funky now </i>
