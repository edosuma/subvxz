WEBVTT

01:09.530 --> 01:10.531
Great shot, Chip.

01:12.886 --> 01:15.055
When I kill you,

01:15.080 --> 01:17.547
I want you to know it's me.

01:17.549 --> 01:19.816
Until then, Cayla.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.751
Sofia!

02:07.265 --> 02:08.098
Commander,

02:08.100 --> 02:12.369
are you gonna introduce
us to your new friend?

02:12.371 --> 02:14.706
I will explain once we get to base.

02:15.807 --> 02:19.175
But for now, he's our king reincarnated.

02:19.177 --> 02:20.012
Zahyian Crehin.

02:21.246 --> 02:24.116
The Zahyian Crehin,
the legendary Royal 4?

02:25.617 --> 02:27.584
So the crystal worked?

02:27.586 --> 02:28.618
It did.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.519
Cool.

02:29.521 --> 02:31.755
So hey, was he like married or?

02:31.757 --> 02:33.156
Hey, were you like
married or, you know,

02:33.158 --> 02:34.691
like have a girlfriend?

02:34.693 --> 02:36.226
Chip!

02:36.228 --> 02:38.864
So this is where the stone lead you to?

02:39.998 --> 02:42.768
This weak, pathetic species of a man?

02:43.935 --> 02:47.203
How could you be so sure the
stone did not lead you astray?

02:55.547 --> 02:59.049
You may be my second in command, Tenan,

02:59.051 --> 03:04.056
but don't think for one second
that I won't crush your skull

03:04.256 --> 03:06.823
if you dare put his life in danger.

03:06.825 --> 03:08.560
Don't address them other than sire.

03:09.861 --> 03:11.863
Blink twice if you understand.

03:14.099 --> 03:16.733
You may not fully realize it yet,

03:16.735 --> 03:19.571
but heed my words, he's your king!

03:21.173 --> 03:24.743
Now stop bullshitting,
everybody, let's go!

03:27.446 --> 03:29.848
You really need to work
on your people skills.

03:35.921 --> 03:40.523
When I kill you

03:40.525 --> 03:42.761
I want you to know it's me.

03:46.631 --> 03:47.566
Until then,

03:50.602 --> 03:51.436
Cayla.

04:00.645 --> 04:03.482
IL-Roserious, are you all right?

04:04.750 --> 04:09.185
Ten, Tenan, Tenan, why is he?

04:09.187 --> 04:11.054
Come on, let's go home.

04:11.056 --> 04:11.921
No, no.

04:11.923 --> 04:14.124
No, I need to go to the Q-temple, the Q-temple-

04:14.126 --> 04:14.958
- You're in no condition-

04:14.960 --> 04:17.660
- Cayla, I need, they need to know-

04:17.662 --> 04:18.495
- Fine.

04:18.497 --> 04:19.631
- I need to tell them,
- Fine.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.667
Make sure she gets to the temple.

04:24.669 --> 04:25.969
Yes, commander.

04:25.971 --> 04:27.339
And don't leave her side!

04:28.907 --> 04:29.741
Come.

04:42.788 --> 04:44.122
Come on, hair.

04:52.531 --> 04:54.464
That feels better.

05:28.233 --> 05:29.065
Fuck.

06:04.035 --> 06:04.968
Shit.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.272
Where is that little fucker?

07:09.067 --> 07:11.034
Move away, beast!

07:11.036 --> 07:12.435
We don't want to fight,

07:12.437 --> 07:13.436
just hand us the odd one

07:13.438 --> 07:16.239
and we'll let you go for today.

07:16.241 --> 07:18.241
No deal, you ugly fuckers,

07:18.243 --> 07:21.110
let's go, come on, come with it!

07:21.112 --> 07:24.047
A feisty one, I like feisty ones.

07:24.049 --> 07:27.383
Maybe I'll keep you around
after I kill the others, huh?

07:27.385 --> 07:29.952
Maybe we'll have a little fun.

07:29.954 --> 07:31.354
I'm gonna cut parts off of you

07:31.356 --> 07:34.359
that you didn't even know you
fucking had, you little bitch!

07:36.361 --> 07:38.063
Let's go, who's first?

07:51.843 --> 07:55.313
Commander Hayden, which one is this Sil?

07:56.181 --> 07:58.581
Neither one, sire,

07:58.583 --> 08:00.251
they are his guards.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.856
They should feel the
power of the Neptonian chant

08:05.890 --> 08:07.692
But hand to hand combat is more rewarding

08:09.094 --> 08:11.830
Let's see if anything's
changed in the last 2000 years.

08:13.732 --> 08:14.998
Who you supposed to be?

08:15.000 --> 08:15.832
You better be bringing

08:15.834 --> 08:17.302
something more than just white eyes.

08:50.301 --> 08:52.437
Where is your master, Sil?

08:53.938 --> 08:55.407
Fuck you, you ancient shit!

09:04.449 --> 09:05.283
Fuck!

09:07.886 --> 09:09.719
Your Cree technique is weak.

09:09.721 --> 09:12.188
This is what you meant to do.

09:23.001 --> 09:28.006
After all the centuries, you
monsters follow the misguided,

09:28.173 --> 09:29.839
the delusional souls

09:29.841 --> 09:33.910
that want nothing but to
spread evil unto our Mother.

09:33.912 --> 09:34.746
No more!

09:35.713 --> 09:40.149
I'm back, Lord Zhayian
Crehin, Lord of Murs.

09:40.151 --> 09:41.984
and I command you-

09:54.199 --> 09:59.204
No!

10:00.638 --> 10:01.473
Focus.

10:08.847 --> 10:09.781
QUIL-INSIN-FIREBIE

10:10.248 --> 10:11.113
QUIL-INSIN-FIREBIE

10:11.115 --> 10:12.851
BOI!

10:19.824 --> 10:20.923
What are you doing?

10:20.925 --> 10:22.060
He needs our help.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.098
Sofia, we have to save him.

10:29.100 --> 10:32.301
No, he needs to find his balance,

10:32.303 --> 10:33.771
between this age and his own.

10:34.472 --> 10:37.874
Commander, this is no time
for a lesson, he could die.

10:37.876 --> 10:40.243
This is a perfect time.

10:40.245 --> 10:41.444
You say you're King of Murs,

10:41.446 --> 10:44.048
so die like they have, in pain!

10:48.052 --> 10:49.220
Sire, focus!

10:50.655 --> 10:53.856
Find your strength, embrace the essence

10:53.858 --> 10:56.392
allow Eric to come with you,

10:56.394 --> 11:01.399
come together and find your balance.

11:09.073 --> 11:10.508
My turn!

11:35.900 --> 11:37.068
- Sire.
- Sire.

11:38.169 --> 11:39.802
Rise, my friends.

11:39.804 --> 11:40.838
I fight with you now.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.142
Commander Hayden, thank you
for talking me through it.

11:46.144 --> 11:48.477
It's my first realization

11:48.479 --> 11:50.046
and I see that it's best handled

11:50.048 --> 11:52.116
with the company of trusted companions.

11:53.718 --> 11:56.285
No, thank you, sire.

11:56.287 --> 11:57.288
Who are these two?

11:58.289 --> 12:02.358
Major Tenan Fy of Murs,
at your service, sire.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.126
It's a pleasure, Major.

12:04.128 --> 12:05.361
And you are?

12:05.363 --> 12:06.629
Chip.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.898
Chip, that's it, Chip?

12:08.900 --> 12:12.034
Yep, I mean, yes, sire.

12:12.036 --> 12:14.405
I am known as the Queen of
Thieves, at your service.

12:15.707 --> 12:17.375
I'm also very skilled fighter.

12:18.376 --> 12:20.245
She's an okay fighter, sire.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.116
I can get you whatever you want.

12:27.085 --> 12:27.919
I see.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.556
I mean, whatever you want.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.424
Chip!

12:35.259 --> 12:37.729
So sire, what did you do to that goon?

12:38.863 --> 12:40.930
I pulled his energy and essence

12:40.932 --> 12:42.500
and gave it back to our Mother.

12:43.368 --> 12:44.600
Why?

12:44.602 --> 12:46.571
So she can use it for something good.

12:47.939 --> 12:48.940
You're a bad sire.

12:51.242 --> 12:54.210
Sire, everybody, we've got to get going,

12:54.212 --> 12:55.680
Sil's guards will be here soon.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.137
Combine your strength

13:21.139 --> 13:22.238
Embrace the essence

13:22.240 --> 13:23.708
Find your balance

13:25.510 --> 13:27.443
Sa-Lum-Sa-Lum,

13:27.445 --> 13:29.414
Veir, Dah, Su-Mon!

13:35.987 --> 13:37.021
Commander Hayden,

13:38.289 --> 13:41.793
the keeper of the stone still lives

13:42.994 --> 13:44.829
and finds a Royal 4, no less.

13:46.064 --> 13:46.898
Hmm.

13:49.067 --> 13:52.537
And I assume you'll be
searching for the other three.

13:53.838 --> 13:55.106
Well, Commander,

13:58.042 --> 13:59.911
I, the Witch Athis

14:00.845 --> 14:04.582
have been following your journey
for quite some time, Sofia,

14:05.550 --> 14:07.985
and you've always been strategic,

14:09.320 --> 14:10.154
careful,

14:11.222 --> 14:12.156
until now.

14:13.291 --> 14:16.594
The power you have awoken
solidifies two things,

14:17.895 --> 14:20.131
The Kings must reclaim their Thrones

14:21.365 --> 14:24.001
and Yahzeel must be found.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.761
I don't have time for this.

14:51.763 --> 14:54.165
Get the fuck out of my way.

14:55.466 --> 15:00.471
The mighty Cayla Korvesian,
alone in the forest.

15:02.373 --> 15:03.975
This is our lucky day.

15:05.777 --> 15:07.476
Isn't it, Squim?

15:07.478 --> 15:09.680
Yes, it looks like
she needs some company.

15:11.149 --> 15:13.651
Yeah, it's dangerous for
her to be in these woods.

15:15.253 --> 15:17.052
I am your queen!

15:17.054 --> 15:20.625
You serve Sil's republic,
which means you serve me!

15:21.526 --> 15:25.795
So stand the fuck down!

15:25.797 --> 15:30.802
No, no, I don't listen to you!

15:31.035 --> 15:32.270
I listen to me.

15:33.304 --> 15:34.806
I was a Tyramglin,

15:35.773 --> 15:37.108
rich and strong,

15:38.409 --> 15:40.745
but now, nothing but a goon.

15:43.014 --> 15:47.316
Created by your master to
roam this forest forever,

15:47.318 --> 15:49.018
living off the dead.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.822
I don't give a shit.

15:52.056 --> 15:53.691
Get the fuck outta my way.

15:54.725 --> 15:58.527
Kill “The Daughter of Demons”
and be praised,

15:58.529 --> 16:00.865
show that we are the demons to be feared

16:01.999 --> 16:03.100
and be rewarded.

16:04.035 --> 16:06.904
Yes, yes.

16:08.239 --> 16:09.273
Do her slow,

16:10.875 --> 16:13.845
bring back pieces for us to taste.

16:18.482 --> 16:19.317
Yes.

16:20.184 --> 16:21.018
Yes.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.455
You goons are fucking delusional.

16:26.390 --> 16:28.893
But I see you want this to happen anyways.

16:30.995 --> 16:31.829
Fine.

16:33.164 --> 16:36.834
My blade will not be soiled
with your disgusting blood.

16:40.304 --> 16:41.839
I'm gonna break you by hand,

16:48.779 --> 16:49.614
painfully.

16:52.950 --> 16:56.921
Yes, yes, I can almost taste you.

17:00.892 --> 17:02.059
You're mine!

17:58.816 --> 18:01.586
You broke my arms!

18:34.285 --> 18:35.720
No, no, please!

18:42.326 --> 18:43.160
Please!

18:44.161 --> 18:45.696
Have mercy, my queen,

18:47.565 --> 18:48.866
I'll do whatever.

18:54.538 --> 18:56.173
Shhhhh.

18:56.974 --> 18:58.609
I understand.

19:00.578 --> 19:05.082
I understand Goon, living in these woods,

19:06.117 --> 19:09.887
it's terrible, I know, I know,

19:11.589 --> 19:13.422
you were just trying to do something

19:13.424 --> 19:15.092
to make you famous, right?

19:17.194 --> 19:20.698
Thinking Sil would give
you your life back?

19:23.034 --> 19:26.470
I respect a man who dares stand up to me.

19:30.074 --> 19:32.109
But you are no man.

20:08.345 --> 20:09.713
Commander, are you okay?

20:11.582 --> 20:12.850
- Whoa.
- Come on.

21:47.211 --> 21:49.011
Who's there?

21:49.013 --> 21:52.481
Hi, my name is Orin.

21:52.483 --> 21:53.815
Sorry to bother you, miss.

21:53.817 --> 21:55.450
I was just looking for some dry clothes

21:55.452 --> 21:57.419
and I heard the water running.

21:57.421 --> 21:58.387
Are you alone?

21:58.389 --> 21:59.590
Yeah, yeah, I'm alone.

22:00.524 --> 22:01.358
Are you sure?

22:02.393 --> 22:04.259
Yes, I'm alone.

22:04.261 --> 22:05.963
Just me, see?

22:07.331 --> 22:09.867
Okay, okay, you can
put your arms down now.

22:13.671 --> 22:15.673
So, Orin, are you taken?

22:18.008 --> 22:19.510
Uh, what was that?

22:20.811 --> 22:24.580
I asked, are you taken,
do you have a girlfriend?

22:24.582 --> 22:26.782
No, no, not right now.

22:26.784 --> 22:27.716
Maybe one day.

22:27.718 --> 22:31.220
Orin, relax, I'm just fucking with you,

22:31.222 --> 22:33.255
just wanted to be the
first to break the ice,

22:33.257 --> 22:34.089
that's all.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.091
Right, break the ice.

22:36.093 --> 22:39.430
Sorry, it's just been a long, long day.

22:40.397 --> 22:41.398
Quite sure it has.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.800
Hey, can you go in that closet over there

22:44.802 --> 22:46.869
and hand me a towel, please?

22:46.871 --> 22:49.404
Sure, anyone in particular?

22:49.406 --> 22:50.241
No.

22:52.443 --> 22:54.076
Hurry up, Orin, it's cold.

22:54.078 --> 22:55.577
Sorry, here you go.

22:55.579 --> 22:56.745
Thank you.

22:56.747 --> 22:58.380
Can I ask you something?

22:58.382 --> 22:59.314
Yeah.

22:59.316 --> 23:00.716
What's your name?

23:00.718 --> 23:03.518
Good question, Aressa.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.787
It's nice to meet you, Aressa.

23:05.789 --> 23:07.992
It's nice to meet you too, Orin.

23:11.996 --> 23:15.130
So, how did you survive in
this house during the invasion?

23:15.132 --> 23:16.865
There was an invasion, right?

23:16.867 --> 23:17.900
Yeah.

23:17.902 --> 23:21.169
Can you actually go over there
and get those clothes for me?

23:21.171 --> 23:22.304
Sure.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.646
Were those clothes always there?

23:30.281 --> 23:31.113
Of course they were.

23:31.115 --> 23:34.116
You stepped over them
earlier, don't you remember?

23:34.118 --> 23:36.251
How did you know what I just-

23:36.253 --> 23:38.253
Did I just say that out loud?

23:38.255 --> 23:39.288
You okay?

23:39.290 --> 23:41.990
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

23:41.992 --> 23:42.991
I guess.

23:42.993 --> 23:44.626
Thank you.

23:44.628 --> 23:46.728
You're quite a character, Orin.

23:46.730 --> 23:48.599
So how did you survive?

23:50.234 --> 23:52.100
By hiding in the sewer.

23:52.102 --> 23:53.302
Ugh.

23:53.304 --> 23:55.337
Yeah, it was terrible,

23:55.339 --> 23:58.473
but it ended up being the perfect place.

23:58.475 --> 24:01.345
Sil's goons never looked there
because it smelled so bad.

24:02.579 --> 24:04.646
What about your family?

24:04.648 --> 24:08.283
Taking as property or
killed before I could escape.

24:08.285 --> 24:10.185
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.687
How long ago was this?

24:11.689 --> 24:13.088
About three years ago.

24:13.090 --> 24:13.922
Three years!

24:13.924 --> 24:15.590
And you're still here?

24:15.592 --> 24:17.092
This is my home.

24:17.094 --> 24:20.162
This, this is my home, no one else's!

24:20.164 --> 24:21.096
I understand that,

24:21.098 --> 24:23.966
but there are still people
out there who can help you.

24:23.968 --> 24:24.802
Help me?

24:25.669 --> 24:28.670
Help how, exactly, Orin?

24:28.672 --> 24:30.839
There's nothing out there.

24:30.841 --> 24:32.541
If Sil's goons catch you

24:32.543 --> 24:34.643
you'll be either made to be a servant

24:34.645 --> 24:36.645
or turned into some mindless goon

24:36.647 --> 24:38.146
that feeds off of the dead

24:38.148 --> 24:39.715
and are used as target practice.

24:39.717 --> 24:41.585
No, not me!

24:43.988 --> 24:45.988
This is our world now.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.392
Kill when you have to,
survive however you can.

24:52.496 --> 24:53.362
I still can't believe

24:53.364 --> 24:56.633
that Mother has to fallen
to the devil himself.

24:58.535 --> 24:59.403
There is no hope.

25:00.371 --> 25:01.703
Of course there is, Aressa.

25:01.705 --> 25:03.472
We have to believe in something.

25:03.474 --> 25:06.208
If we don't, we might as
well be dead ourselves.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.209
Maybe we should be.

25:07.211 --> 25:09.611
Come on, don't think like that.

25:09.613 --> 25:11.146
Look, I'm sorry if I upset you.

25:11.148 --> 25:13.817
No, I should apologize.

25:15.219 --> 25:16.051
I didn't mean to snap-

25:16.053 --> 25:18.854
- No, no, I get it, I get it, it's fine.

25:18.856 --> 25:20.924
Things are not normal anymore, I know.

25:22.326 --> 25:25.127
Hey, I saw a symbol for the Resistance

25:25.129 --> 25:26.895
above a door when I got in,
do you know where they are?

25:26.897 --> 25:28.397
Yeah, those fuckers,

25:28.399 --> 25:32.868
they came in, took everything
that wasn't broken and left.

25:32.870 --> 25:34.136
Really?

25:34.138 --> 25:35.470
When was this?

25:35.472 --> 25:38.740
About a year ago, but I
wouldn't worry about them.

25:38.742 --> 25:40.110
They're nothing but thieves.

25:41.412 --> 25:43.178
In a way I don't blame them.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.646
Are you sure?

25:44.648 --> 25:46.481
I hear the leader was a former ambassador

25:46.483 --> 25:48.650
from one of the largest
regions in the north

25:48.652 --> 25:50.819
and then he fled when he found
other fellow world leaders

25:50.821 --> 25:52.687
were in cahoots with Sil

25:52.689 --> 25:55.891
and that his bond with
Mother, it's extremely strong,

25:55.893 --> 25:58.894
strong enough to keep the
Resistance hidden from anyone,

25:58.896 --> 26:00.162
even Sil.

26:00.164 --> 26:02.564
Well, I say, forget them.

26:02.566 --> 26:04.900
Should worry about keeping yourself alive.

26:04.902 --> 26:05.736
Excuse me.

26:07.504 --> 26:09.606
Was that jewelry always there?

26:11.108 --> 26:13.308
You know, you're looking a little tired.

26:13.310 --> 26:16.311
Why don't you have to take
a shower and get some rest?

26:16.313 --> 26:17.979
No, no, thank you.

26:17.981 --> 26:20.649
I can't, I don't have time right now.

26:20.651 --> 26:21.650
Time?

26:21.652 --> 26:25.487
What, are you on a secret
mission and someone's after you?

26:25.489 --> 26:26.321
What?

26:26.323 --> 26:28.090
Why don't you just
take your clothes off,

26:28.092 --> 26:29.991
hop in the shower.

26:29.993 --> 26:31.328
There's no one here but us.

26:32.362 --> 26:33.197
I don't know.

26:34.298 --> 26:36.798
No, I really should be getting going.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.634
Orin,

26:39.503 --> 26:41.103
you stink.

26:41.105 --> 26:43.805
Take off these rags, hop in the shower.

26:43.807 --> 26:46.007
I'll keep a lookout for you.

26:46.009 --> 26:48.210
Yeah, I think you're right.

26:48.212 --> 26:49.811
It would be good to wash it off.

26:49.813 --> 26:50.848
Sure it would.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.825
Wow, what a cut.

27:02.826 --> 27:05.329
It looks, beautiful.

27:07.164 --> 27:07.998
What was that?

27:11.535 --> 27:13.370
Come on, let me take my shower first.

27:17.875 --> 27:18.707
What are you?

27:18.709 --> 27:19.541
What do you want?

27:19.543 --> 27:22.212
I'm a scavenger, darling,
haven't you heard of us?

27:24.181 --> 27:26.848
We can see your deepest desires

27:26.850 --> 27:28.118
and you desire me!

27:29.153 --> 27:30.919
A scavenger?

27:30.921 --> 27:33.755
Relax, Orin, relax.

27:33.757 --> 27:35.926
I cannot feed until you concede.

27:36.860 --> 27:39.129
Be a good boy, and let me in!

27:41.331 --> 27:43.064
It's been such a long time

27:43.066 --> 27:46.468
since I've dined on bones such as yours,

27:46.470 --> 27:50.774
tight muscles, clean blood, I want you raw!

28:07.858 --> 28:10.360
I'M HUNGRY, I'M HUNGRY!

28:20.737 --> 28:22.339
Relax, dear, relax,

28:23.640 --> 28:25.774
accept your fate, darling.

28:25.776 --> 28:27.544
I cannot feed until you concede.

28:31.448 --> 28:34.618
Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod!

28:38.589 --> 28:40.524
So you're a Fusionite?

28:41.558 --> 28:43.558
I thought you were all dead.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.295
How did you survive, dear?

28:48.298 --> 28:51.034
Your artform doesn't work on me, boy.

28:51.969 --> 28:56.974
Concede to me, let me in.

28:58.542 --> 29:01.211
You wouldn't want to poison me now, do you?

29:02.846 --> 29:04.848
I'm going to kill you.

29:06.316 --> 29:08.318
I know you want to, dear Orin,

29:10.053 --> 29:12.420
but your muscles are getting weak,

29:12.422 --> 29:17.194
your breath is slowing
and you're losing blood,

29:18.862 --> 29:20.564
that sweet Fusionite blood.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.470
Give me the pleasure of feasting on you.

29:28.805 --> 29:29.640
Let go!

29:51.261 --> 29:52.863
Concede, to, me!

29:56.066 --> 29:57.734
Let, me, in!

30:33.570 --> 30:36.039
Don't die on us yet young man.

30:40.277 --> 30:42.477
Grab my arm and fuse.

30:42.479 --> 30:43.980
Please, help me.

30:45.515 --> 30:48.785
I am, boy, grab my arm and fuse, now.

30:55.659 --> 30:57.928
Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.181
Concede, to, me!

31:26.990 --> 31:30.894
BILISH-TICGOR-ROE-RAYTHUM!

31:56.420 --> 31:59.356
They can regenerate any part
of their body like a lizard.

32:00.724 --> 32:04.027
They're hard to kill, but
you did it, though, good job.

32:05.061 --> 32:05.896
You got a light?

32:06.763 --> 32:07.597
Who are you?

32:09.332 --> 32:10.467
Where are my manners?

32:12.068 --> 32:14.404
My name is Captain Rinshi Su Cora,

32:15.405 --> 32:17.707
a Croathian from the City of Kyzin.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.308
But you can call me Rinny.

32:20.310 --> 32:22.612
Okay, why didn't you help me?

32:23.680 --> 32:25.380
I thought I did.

32:25.382 --> 32:28.683
Yeah, you could've killed her yourself.

32:28.685 --> 32:32.789
With these powers, why didn't you?

32:34.324 --> 32:38.026
I needed to know if
you are, who I thought you were.

32:38.028 --> 32:39.794
What are you talking about?

32:39.796 --> 32:42.866
It's an honor to meet
you, Mr. Orin TiRosch,

32:43.733 --> 32:47.068
Son of the famous Fusionite
scientist, Braythin

32:47.070 --> 32:49.873
and Angelamare
TiRosch... yes?...

32:50.874 --> 32:52.507
How do you know about my parents?

32:52.509 --> 32:54.275
How do you know about me?

32:54.277 --> 32:56.044
I don't know you!

32:56.046 --> 32:59.249
I should just kill you right
here with your own powers.

33:00.350 --> 33:01.950
You may,

33:01.952 --> 33:03.585
but we both know my counter moves

33:03.587 --> 33:05.253
and the fight will take far too long

33:05.255 --> 33:07.322
to be worth the time we don't have.

33:07.324 --> 33:08.723
Who are you?

33:08.725 --> 33:09.693
Answer me!

33:11.027 --> 33:14.064
I'll tell you, but can I
please have my throat back?

33:20.737 --> 33:21.571
Thank you, sir.

33:22.472 --> 33:24.138
As I mentioned before,

33:24.140 --> 33:27.277
I am Captain Rinshi Su Cora
from the City of Kyzin

33:28.278 --> 33:29.377
and an ambassador

33:29.379 --> 33:31.980
for the very group you're
forced to look for.

33:31.982 --> 33:33.414
The Resistance?

33:33.416 --> 33:34.482
Yes.

33:34.484 --> 33:36.050
How do you know?

33:36.052 --> 33:39.220
It's hard not to, when "The
Daughter of Demons" herself

33:39.222 --> 33:40.822
recruits a new scout.

33:40.824 --> 33:42.225
It wasn't my choice.

33:43.593 --> 33:45.293
I know, young TiRosch.

33:45.295 --> 33:46.561
I also know that your parents

33:46.563 --> 33:49.497
and Commander Hayden
were very good friends.

33:49.499 --> 33:50.698
I believe they assisted her

33:50.700 --> 33:54.869
in rediscovering the ability
of bridging between worlds

33:54.871 --> 33:57.372
with use of the Stone of Essence.

33:57.374 --> 33:59.073
You know Commander Hayden?

33:59.075 --> 34:00.508
I do.

34:00.510 --> 34:02.045
I even knew her parents,

34:03.213 --> 34:07.448
Madielyyn and Sorkinston Hayden of
Murs,

34:07.450 --> 34:10.585
the most feared military
couple in the city.

34:10.587 --> 34:12.086
And they made sure their little girl

34:12.088 --> 34:13.988
earned the same recognition.

34:13.990 --> 34:15.823
Do you know where she is?

34:15.825 --> 34:17.725
Doing what she was meant to do,

34:17.727 --> 34:20.228
holding her pledge as
the keeper of the stone

34:20.230 --> 34:22.297
and searching for the Royal 4.

34:22.299 --> 34:23.831
The Royal 4?

34:23.833 --> 34:25.633
The myth about the 3 Kings and Queen

34:25.635 --> 34:27.635
who defeated an evil warlock named Yahzeel

34:27.637 --> 34:29.370
over 2000 years ago?

34:29.372 --> 34:31.105
That Royal 4?

34:31.107 --> 34:33.843
That is a mouthful,
but yes, that Royal 4.

34:34.878 --> 34:37.814
And I assure you, they are quite real.

34:38.782 --> 34:41.849
And they are presently living
in their reincarnated bodies

34:41.851 --> 34:43.086
that Sofia must find.

34:45.789 --> 34:48.289
When I was little, my
mother used to tell me

34:48.291 --> 34:50.124
about how the Royal 4
would be needed again,

34:50.126 --> 34:52.193
to defeat a great evil.

34:52.195 --> 34:56.264
But I always just thought it was a story

34:56.266 --> 34:57.400
to make me go to bed.

34:58.234 --> 35:00.403
I never thought it
would be something real,

35:01.338 --> 35:04.708
or if it was, it would
ever be in my lifetime.

35:05.775 --> 35:07.508
Your mother knew something was coming

35:07.510 --> 35:08.645
and wanted you to know.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.713
Come on, we need to go.

35:11.715 --> 35:13.715
Let's go see your brother.

35:13.717 --> 35:15.285
What did you say?

35:16.319 --> 35:17.852
My brother's dead.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.687
No, Orin, he is alive.

35:19.689 --> 35:21.189
Your brother survived.

35:21.191 --> 35:23.458
What kinda shit are
you trying to pull, Rinny?

35:23.460 --> 35:25.495
I saw him die myself during the invasion.

35:26.463 --> 35:29.797
What you saw was him
getting injured, not dying.

35:29.799 --> 35:30.634
What?

35:33.236 --> 35:36.838
We found him after the
invasion, barely breathing.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.240
Look Orin, I know this is
a lot to take all at once,

35:39.242 --> 35:42.710
but I promise to explain more later.

35:42.712 --> 35:46.481
We gotta get out of here now
before more scavengers arrive.

35:46.483 --> 35:50.518
Wait, wait, this isn't making any sense.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.520
I understand, but we need to go now,

35:52.522 --> 35:55.223
unless you want to fight another scavenger.

35:55.225 --> 35:57.692
Wait, so if what you're saying's true,

35:57.694 --> 35:59.462
tell me something about my brother.

36:01.865 --> 36:04.132
Your brother talks too damn much.

36:04.134 --> 36:06.636
He's consistently yapping
about all kinds of shit.

36:07.837 --> 36:09.139
The boy drives me crazy.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.976
Yeah, he does talk a lot.

36:35.565 --> 36:37.400
Ba-La-Ry-Ba-La-Tok,

36:37.767 --> 36:40.503
Myne, Kyne, Toh, Cross!

36:48.111 --> 36:49.677
Are you ready?

36:49.679 --> 36:50.713
What is this?

36:52.615 --> 36:55.685
Welcome to the Resistance, Young TiRosch.

37:06.863 --> 37:08.031
Right there.

37:09.532 --> 37:11.032
Where's Sofia?

37:11.034 --> 37:13.236
Upstairs, keeping an eye on things.

37:14.370 --> 37:15.171
Ah.

37:20.243 --> 37:21.311
That's about right.

37:22.245 --> 37:23.146
Damn, I'm good.

37:27.117 --> 37:28.349
So, sire?

37:28.351 --> 37:30.051
What do you think?

37:30.053 --> 37:33.721
Well done, Chip, well done.

37:33.723 --> 37:36.324
You have some great
skills with this device.

37:36.326 --> 37:37.558
I feel like a new man.

37:37.560 --> 37:40.361
Well, sire, you kinda already are.

37:40.363 --> 37:41.696
Yeah, good point.

37:41.698 --> 37:43.397
Did you learn this skill on your own?

37:43.399 --> 37:44.232
I did.

37:44.234 --> 37:45.066
You know, when you're an orphan,

37:45.068 --> 37:47.203
you learn to pick up a
thing or two on your own.

37:48.171 --> 37:49.737
Guess you would have to.

37:49.739 --> 37:51.405
Yeah, you do.

37:51.407 --> 37:54.144
So tell me, what is your name?

37:55.178 --> 37:56.177
What do you mean, sire?

37:56.179 --> 37:58.079
I mean, you know my name.

37:58.081 --> 37:58.915
But I don't.

38:00.383 --> 38:04.220
I noticed you were a Tyramglin
species, but who are you?

38:08.791 --> 38:10.091
Oh no, no, no, no, sire.

38:10.093 --> 38:11.759
It's me, Chip, remember?

38:11.761 --> 38:13.227
Are you Eric right now, maybe you're Eric.

38:13.229 --> 38:16.631
Like, I'm Chip, you know
what, I'm gonna go get Sofia.

38:16.633 --> 38:18.699
She knows exactly what to
do, just give me one second.

38:18.701 --> 38:19.969
Chip, it's all right.

38:21.271 --> 38:24.539
It's all right, my memory's just fine.

38:24.541 --> 38:26.941
I was just asking about
your real name, that's all.

38:26.943 --> 38:28.843
Oh, thank god.

38:28.845 --> 38:31.612
I thought Eric was coming
back out for a second.

38:31.614 --> 38:35.550
I was just thinking,
Chip, Queen of Thieves,

38:35.552 --> 38:37.253
doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

38:38.154 --> 38:40.056
I sense there's something more to that.

38:41.124 --> 38:42.225
It doesn't, does it.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.594
You know what, let me
properly introduce myself.

38:46.596 --> 38:50.965
My name is Mia Bello, Queen
of Thieves, at your service.

38:50.967 --> 38:54.437
Ah, Mia Bello, Queen of Thieves,

38:55.505 --> 38:56.973
now that sounds more like it.

38:57.874 --> 38:59.475
Pleasure to meet you Miss Bello.

39:00.510 --> 39:02.378
So where did the name Chip come from?

39:03.213 --> 39:07.415
Well, when I first met Tenan and Sofia

39:07.417 --> 39:10.084
I wasn't too pleasant or nor cooperative.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.452
I mean, why would I be?

39:11.454 --> 39:12.286
I just escaped

39:12.288 --> 39:15.489
one of the most horrific
experiences of my life,

39:15.491 --> 39:17.058
his killing campaigns.

39:17.060 --> 39:20.328
Everyone I knew was being taken,

39:20.330 --> 39:22.597
killed in front of my own eyes.

39:22.599 --> 39:26.234
That fucking monster
destroyed my everything.

39:26.236 --> 39:27.435
Sil.

39:27.437 --> 39:28.271
Yeah, him.

39:29.973 --> 39:33.808
Before all this I was the
Queen of the Underworld,

39:33.810 --> 39:36.412
the bitch everyone loved,
the bitch everyone feared.

39:37.247 --> 39:40.848
Hell, sire, I had princes

39:40.850 --> 39:43.684
and ambassadors offer me
things you can't even imagine

39:43.686 --> 39:45.388
just for one night with me.

39:47.590 --> 39:48.825
And then he came.

39:50.927 --> 39:51.928
And he took it all.

39:53.663 --> 39:54.697
And then I met Sofia.

39:56.299 --> 39:59.800
Well, she admired my
thieving skills and you know,

39:59.802 --> 40:01.504
my thirst to see Sil dead.

40:02.972 --> 40:05.039
You know what, one day she said to me,

40:05.041 --> 40:08.609
I like you, woman, you are survivor.

40:08.611 --> 40:11.381
You've got the fire in your
belly that burns so bright.

40:12.348 --> 40:13.881
And I like that.

40:13.883 --> 40:16.452
And you possess a strong
chip on your shoulder

40:17.320 --> 40:19.720
And I see that you don't hide yours.

40:19.722 --> 40:22.325
So, I think I'm going to call you Chip.

40:23.726 --> 40:24.560
Sofia's right.

40:25.962 --> 40:27.397
That edge, that chip,

40:28.298 --> 40:29.932
something you never want to lose.

40:31.134 --> 40:33.601
Well, sire, it's something
that's always been there

40:33.603 --> 40:35.036
and it always will be.

40:35.038 --> 40:36.940
Yes, I can see that.

40:38.942 --> 40:40.043
You know, Chip,

40:41.644 --> 40:44.378
I want you guys to understand

40:44.380 --> 40:48.182
that when I had Lord Yowan, Lord Gato,

40:48.184 --> 40:50.887
Queen Ki and myself cast
our essence into the stone,

40:51.754 --> 40:55.289
it was my intention is to
have our artforms die with us,

40:55.291 --> 40:57.927
never allowing it a chance
to be used for evil again.

40:58.795 --> 41:00.828
Well, shit happens, sire.

41:00.830 --> 41:01.664
Yeah.

41:02.565 --> 41:03.397
Well, these dark days

41:03.399 --> 41:05.435
were supposed to have ended with Yahzeel.

41:07.236 --> 41:10.104
What I can't seem to understand

41:10.106 --> 41:12.642
is why would Mother allow
a devil to be born again?

41:14.444 --> 41:16.145
Did we miss something so long ago?

41:18.715 --> 41:20.149
It's not your fault, sire.

41:21.217 --> 41:26.222
I mean, Mother can be an
unpredictable bitch at times,

41:26.556 --> 41:29.225
but if you look on the bright side,

41:30.293 --> 41:33.663
the Royal 4 is back,
they're here to save us all,

41:34.564 --> 41:37.433
and you're not some fairytale.

41:39.769 --> 41:41.469
What was that?

41:41.471 --> 41:42.905
Oh, Sofia didn't tell you?

41:43.873 --> 41:48.409
Well, species down here
tells it as a literary fable,

41:48.411 --> 41:50.344
that they tell the kids if they're bad

41:50.346 --> 41:51.712
the Royal 4 will come back

41:51.714 --> 41:53.214
and bury them in The Forest of SiKoran.

41:53.216 --> 41:54.548
That is preposterous.

41:54.550 --> 41:56.617
We, we do not murder children.

41:56.619 --> 41:58.419
We are Ressear's protectors.

41:58.421 --> 42:00.388
We are not monsters.

42:00.390 --> 42:02.456
I know that now, but sire,

42:02.458 --> 42:05.659
a story that as old as you
are kinda had a way of-

42:07.030 --> 42:09.497
No, that's outrageous.

42:09.499 --> 42:11.165
I know, right?

42:11.167 --> 42:11.999
Chip!

42:12.001 --> 42:13.034
Yeah?

42:13.036 --> 42:15.236
Have you done his sire's hair?

42:15.238 --> 42:16.437
Yeah?

42:16.439 --> 42:18.305
It's your turn to come up here.

42:18.307 --> 42:19.876
Yeah, coming.

42:26.182 --> 42:28.017
Really, a fairy tale?

42:28.985 --> 42:30.486
Well, not anymore, sire.

42:51.541 --> 42:53.474
Reagor, do you have the king?

42:53.476 --> 42:56.944
No, looks like
a bomb hit this place.

42:56.946 --> 42:57.980
Do you want me to-

43:12.428 --> 43:13.327
Hey, sire.

43:13.329 --> 43:14.962
How you feeling?

43:14.964 --> 43:16.265
A little taken back.

43:17.166 --> 43:18.801
Is it true we're a scary story?

43:20.369 --> 43:22.036
Chip told you, huh?

43:22.038 --> 43:23.571
Yes.

43:23.573 --> 43:26.275
This is why I told you
about Akinnis in the theater,

43:27.577 --> 43:28.411
do you remember?

43:29.779 --> 43:31.180
You were Eric at the time?

43:32.315 --> 43:34.417
I think so, it was a little foggy,

43:35.318 --> 43:36.450
but I believe you stated

43:36.452 --> 43:39.019
that he was the only one who
believed in me at the time.

43:39.021 --> 43:43.626
Yes, including a few
of us who knew the truth.

43:45.261 --> 43:47.130
Thank you, but why did you?

43:49.432 --> 43:51.932
I'll explain everything to you later.

43:51.934 --> 43:54.034
Right now we need to
begin to gather provision

43:54.036 --> 43:57.404
and prepare for base camp
as we sail down this river.

43:57.406 --> 43:58.239
Fine,

43:58.241 --> 44:01.275
but I expect to be briefed
on everything once we arrive.

44:01.277 --> 44:04.380
Of course, sire, Mother's my witness.

44:06.315 --> 44:08.115
Where are the clothes I got for you?

44:08.117 --> 44:09.550
What clothes?

44:09.552 --> 44:13.020
The clothes that Chip was
supposed to have given to you.

44:13.022 --> 44:15.155
She didn't give me anything.

44:15.157 --> 44:17.894
Oh, geez, that girl with men.

44:23.666 --> 44:24.798
Here, sire.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.867
Thank you, Commander.

45:28.831 --> 45:31.801
Istaaa-Gon-Rorrr.

50:06.642 --> 50:09.409
Well, you've done more
than enough today, Sofia.

50:09.411 --> 50:12.713
Why don't you get some rest and wash up

50:12.715 --> 50:14.882
and I'll do some catching
up with these guys

50:14.884 --> 50:15.716
in the meantime.

50:15.718 --> 50:18.521
That's a good idea, thank you.

50:19.855 --> 50:23.190
Now, try not to get in
trouble while I'm gone.

50:23.192 --> 50:25.194
I'm a king, it's what I do.

50:27.263 --> 50:28.764
Sofia, quick question,

50:30.165 --> 50:32.432
where did you find The Stone of Essence?

50:32.434 --> 50:34.169
I'm a woman, that's what we do.

50:39.074 --> 50:41.975
How the fuck can Tenan
Fy still be alive, Cayla?

50:41.977 --> 50:44.680
I thought you killed everyone
in Murs, especially him.

50:46.081 --> 50:48.782
It happens, IL-Roserious,

50:48.784 --> 50:53.186
some slipped out, some
died on the way out,

50:53.188 --> 50:55.257
in the end they all die by our hand

50:57.026 --> 50:58.861
or serve Sil of course.

51:00.195 --> 51:01.228
Cayla.

51:01.230 --> 51:06.135
Rah, baby, please, it's been a long day.

51:07.169 --> 51:09.870
Why don't you join me, huh?

51:09.872 --> 51:11.373
Relax a little.

51:16.312 --> 51:19.248
Fine, have some wine.

51:20.115 --> 51:21.150
No, Cayla.

51:26.188 --> 51:29.690
This is Tenan Fy, Cayla, not just

51:29.692 --> 51:32.826
some headstrong Croathian
you can simply manipulate.

51:32.828 --> 51:35.462
He's a prodigy, like me.

51:35.464 --> 51:38.498
He's a legend for what he
did amongst his species

51:38.500 --> 51:41.802
during the Murs invasion, your invasion.

51:41.804 --> 51:45.439
I know, he killed a lot all by-

51:45.441 --> 51:47.142
- Two hundred, Cayla.

51:48.210 --> 51:51.845
200 of your men by himself.

51:51.847 --> 51:53.082
I was there

51:54.016 --> 51:55.250
and Murs still fell.

51:56.251 --> 51:57.753
And this doesn't bother you?

51:58.654 --> 51:59.953
Really?

51:59.955 --> 52:03.056
Can't you see, if other
Croathians find out

52:03.058 --> 52:04.758
that their leader is still alive?

52:04.760 --> 52:07.561
That he still fights for them?

52:07.563 --> 52:09.863
This can cause problems in the Alliance.

52:09.865 --> 52:12.566
And on top of that, my Quensentian army

52:12.568 --> 52:15.068
consists of hundreds of
these headstrong brutes

52:15.070 --> 52:18.605
and I do not need to start
killing off pieces of my own.

52:18.607 --> 52:20.776
If so, so what, Rah?

52:21.844 --> 52:22.876
There's plenty of species

52:22.878 --> 52:25.180
that want to be part of
your Quensentian Order

52:26.048 --> 52:29.351
and wear those sexy-ass outfits.

52:30.319 --> 52:33.620
Yeah, well, I need a
certain amount of Croathians

52:33.622 --> 52:35.956
in my Order to maintain balance.

52:35.958 --> 52:37.524
I know.

52:37.526 --> 52:39.995
We have to be smart
about things and reset.

52:40.963 --> 52:43.664
We still have an ancient king to find,

52:43.666 --> 52:46.466
cities to prep for Yahzeel's return,

52:46.468 --> 52:48.971
and a Resistance to kill.

52:50.272 --> 52:53.909
So, c'mon, take off those
wet clothes and relax.

52:56.145 --> 52:59.212
I am just concerned
about SWA finding out

52:59.214 --> 53:01.348
that Tenan is still alive.

53:01.350 --> 53:03.784
You know, Lieutenant Kytan
is a Croathian himself,

53:03.786 --> 53:06.653
and he still holds reverence for him.

53:06.655 --> 53:08.355
Yeah, that's rich,

53:08.357 --> 53:11.060
he's the one that led most
of them to their slaughter.

53:13.962 --> 53:15.197
Baby, look,

53:16.832 --> 53:20.202
soon the Supreme World Alliance
will be a thing of the past.

53:21.203 --> 53:25.841
And once Sil finds Yahzeel,
our powers will be endless,

53:26.909 --> 53:29.443
our cities countless,

53:29.445 --> 53:33.582
and best of all, we will
be queens of everything.

53:36.518 --> 53:40.120
You know that I am yours and you are mine,

53:40.122 --> 53:41.190
we are his.

53:42.224 --> 53:44.157
Together we are shaping Ressear

53:44.159 --> 53:46.562
into a new world just for us.

53:47.596 --> 53:49.362
So fuck Tenan.

53:49.364 --> 53:51.198
Fuck 'em all.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.068
They'll be dead soon anyways.

53:56.472 --> 53:57.539
You're right, baby.

53:58.607 --> 53:59.441
I know I am.

54:00.943 --> 54:05.011
So come on, have the
servants take care of you.

54:05.013 --> 54:06.882
Take off those wet clothes.

54:07.750 --> 54:09.249
Not right now.

54:09.251 --> 54:10.450
I'm planning on meeting up

54:10.452 --> 54:11.918
with some of my top Quensentian soldiers

54:11.920 --> 54:16.156
tonight after Sil's
meeting to begin a search.

54:16.158 --> 54:18.258
You're relentless, Rah,

54:18.260 --> 54:19.728
that's what I love about you.

54:21.230 --> 54:23.330
Can I bring some of my soldiers too?

54:23.332 --> 54:24.831
Please do.

54:24.833 --> 54:26.933
I can't wait to see you
get your second shot

54:26.935 --> 54:28.401
at my former leader.

54:28.403 --> 54:29.505
Former leader?

54:30.706 --> 54:32.105
You know, Sofia?

54:32.107 --> 54:34.141
Of course, she was my commander

54:34.143 --> 54:36.843
when I was with the
Neptonian Special Forces,

54:36.845 --> 54:37.946
alongside Tenan.

54:39.014 --> 54:41.016
I didn't think she was
still alive, though.

54:43.819 --> 54:45.320
Why didn't you say anything?

54:47.956 --> 54:49.358
Why didn't she say anything?

54:51.260 --> 54:54.528
Sofia led several
divisions for many years

54:54.530 --> 54:56.296
so most of our orders

54:56.298 --> 54:58.798
were given to us secondhand
by our lieutenants.

54:58.800 --> 55:02.704
So she wouldn't know what
most of us look like anyway.

55:04.006 --> 55:05.874
She must've heard you though

55:06.108 --> 55:08.575
since you had a bounty
on your head for treason.

55:08.577 --> 55:10.510
Yeah, still do.

55:10.512 --> 55:13.713
But I doubt she even cared
anyway because that time,

55:13.715 --> 55:16.116
that was the beginning of Sil's invasions.

55:16.118 --> 55:19.452
So I was the least of her problems.

55:19.454 --> 55:21.590
But you could have
told me at some point.

55:23.058 --> 55:24.357
Yeah, I know,

55:24.359 --> 55:26.092
but I didn't want to give
away our new advantage.

55:26.094 --> 55:29.563
Besides, best she didn't know that I know.

55:29.565 --> 55:32.766
Well, I know she ran into the
southern part of the forest.

55:32.768 --> 55:35.502
That's where I sent SK10 to look for them.

55:35.504 --> 55:37.270
Oh, do you have a team following them?

55:37.272 --> 55:38.438
Good.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.207
Not anymore.

55:40.209 --> 55:42.711
Reagor informed me that
they were all slaughtered.

55:43.612 --> 55:45.581
Looks like the area got hit by a bomb.

55:47.082 --> 55:49.649
Looks like the king has been realized.

55:49.651 --> 55:50.485
Shit.

55:56.058 --> 55:57.059
The Ziltion River.

55:58.627 --> 56:00.927
That river leads to
that area of the forest

56:00.929 --> 56:03.997
and I know Sofia likes to travel by water,

56:03.999 --> 56:05.498
especially at night.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.833
Why is that?

56:06.835 --> 56:09.204
Her artform is stronger near water.

56:12.174 --> 56:14.774
You know, that river leads

56:14.776 --> 56:17.112
towards the site of Sil's first invasion.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.914
You think she'll show
using it as a hideout?

56:20.916 --> 56:22.249
I would.

56:22.251 --> 56:24.818
That place is like a blood filled tomb,

56:24.820 --> 56:26.353
no one would be able to stomach it

56:26.355 --> 56:29.625
for a long period of
time, except for Sofia.

56:31.727 --> 56:34.196
You are so fucking badass.

56:39.801 --> 56:40.869
Get me a phone!

56:47.609 --> 56:48.975
Lieutenant Kryst,

56:48.977 --> 56:52.178
have Killing Squad 3 search
south of The Ziltion River

56:52.180 --> 56:54.549
for a boat carrying
members of the Resistance.

56:55.918 --> 56:57.450
No,

56:57.452 --> 56:58.787
bring them all back alive.

57:00.188 --> 57:01.256
In any condition.

57:02.257 --> 57:03.892
No, now, Lieutenant.

57:07.362 --> 57:08.830
I need to give her a visit.

57:09.831 --> 57:12.467
I guess my search for Tenan may be over.

57:14.169 --> 57:15.370
Maybe.

57:16.471 --> 57:19.439
Soon Sil will have the King's head

57:19.441 --> 57:21.810
and I will have Sofia's
corpse on my plate.

57:22.844 --> 57:25.013
So Commander Hayden is the King's guard.

57:26.581 --> 57:27.414
My love.

57:27.416 --> 57:30.617
This explains why I could
only see the King and not her.

57:30.619 --> 57:32.519
You know Sofia?

57:32.521 --> 57:34.621
We were once closely aligned

57:34.623 --> 57:36.525
in a time nearly forgotten.

57:38.560 --> 57:39.559
It seemed, however,

57:39.561 --> 57:41.630
that she would rather hold her pledge to,

57:43.832 --> 57:47.000
you know, the Neptonian order.

57:47.002 --> 57:49.037
What is important is who she is guarding,

57:50.138 --> 57:52.005
Lord Zahyian Crehin.

57:52.007 --> 57:53.807
You can see who it is now?

57:53.809 --> 57:54.643
Oh, yes.

57:55.544 --> 57:56.843
SiKoran's essence is strong,

57:56.845 --> 58:00.513
it allows me to see and
feel things once obscured.

58:00.515 --> 58:03.550
I can feel his realization
growing in strength.

58:03.552 --> 58:05.585
Can you pinpoint his location?

58:05.587 --> 58:06.419
Not clearly.

58:06.421 --> 58:09.222
The cloaking chant Sofia
has surrounding herself

58:09.224 --> 58:11.257
is stronger than I remember.

58:11.259 --> 58:13.660
Well, we may have
found out where she is.

58:13.662 --> 58:17.530
I just sent KS3 south
of the Zilshin River.

58:17.532 --> 58:19.032
We believe Sofia may be headed

58:19.034 --> 58:21.501
towards the site of your first invasion

58:21.503 --> 58:23.837
to lay low because it's abandoned.

58:23.839 --> 58:25.107
True to her character.

58:26.074 --> 58:27.974
I'm curious, my love,

58:27.976 --> 58:30.076
why couldn't you see Sofia before?

58:30.078 --> 58:34.282
Sofia is strong in the
ancient arts, a true student,

58:35.550 --> 58:36.883
but no one is strong enough

58:36.885 --> 58:39.686
to fully conceal a King's essence,

58:39.688 --> 58:43.923
especially one like Zahyian Crehin.

58:43.925 --> 58:45.325
You admire her.

58:45.327 --> 58:46.928
Not enough to spare her life.

58:50.432 --> 58:52.834
I see you two have had
an intimate encounter.

58:53.702 --> 58:57.303
I was blindsided by
Tenan and Sofia is all,

58:57.305 --> 58:58.571
it's nothing.

58:58.573 --> 59:00.142
Tenan Fy is alive?

59:01.710 --> 59:03.877
And Mia Bello.

59:03.879 --> 59:05.512
The Queen of Thieves?

59:05.514 --> 59:08.314
She's the one who hit me
when I was up against the tree.

59:08.316 --> 59:09.851
She must have blindsided you.

59:10.786 --> 59:12.454
Mia is alive as well.

59:12.854 --> 59:14.654
That fucking
subterranean rodent.

59:14.656 --> 59:16.089
If you're right about where they are,

59:16.091 --> 59:18.992
KS3 should have no
trouble securing the King.

59:18.994 --> 59:21.728
His abilities are not
at full strength yet.

59:21.730 --> 59:24.264
In the meantime we need
to prepare for tonight.

59:24.266 --> 59:26.368
Our time of sovereignty is upon us.

59:27.335 --> 59:29.271
What's the urgency
for tonight's meeting?

59:30.372 --> 59:34.307
Wait, you found him, didn't you?

59:34.309 --> 59:35.310
Didn't you, my love?

59:36.511 --> 59:37.612
You found Yahzeel.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.748
Is that true?

59:41.316 --> 59:42.849
Maybe we should cancel tonight's meeting

59:42.851 --> 59:44.150
and begin the ritual to-

59:44.152 --> 59:45.153
- Be still, Cayla.

59:46.121 --> 59:47.789
We are carrying on as planned.

59:49.558 --> 59:50.757
Tonight's meeting must take place

59:50.759 --> 59:52.561
in order for us to take ours.

59:53.995 --> 59:55.628
And to answer your other question,

59:55.630 --> 59:58.598
Vowlen discovered his tomb not
far from where we were today

59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.099
in Sikoran.

1:00:00.101 --> 1:00:00.936
Sikoran?

1:00:01.870 --> 1:00:03.470
He's buried in Sikoran?

1:00:03.472 --> 1:00:04.938
He is.

1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:07.740
You knew he was buried
there this whole time.

1:00:07.742 --> 1:00:09.142
Why didn't you let us know?

1:00:09.144 --> 1:00:11.110
Because I needed you two to focus on

1:00:11.112 --> 1:00:13.613
finding the King and killing him

1:00:13.615 --> 1:00:16.017
so that we wouldn't be facing
the problem we have now.

1:00:16.952 --> 1:00:20.253
Vowlan contacted me while
I was on my way to you,

1:00:20.255 --> 1:00:22.188
informing me that Sikoran had awoken,

1:00:22.190 --> 1:00:25.158
unleashing the forest
native armies upon his camp.

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:28.328
That is why I needed to tame that thing,

1:00:28.330 --> 1:00:30.296
so that we can begin
excavation on Yahzeel's tomb

1:00:30.298 --> 1:00:32.100
without any interference from him.

1:00:33.502 --> 1:00:34.934
I'm still amazed

1:00:34.936 --> 1:00:37.971
that you were able to tame
an Immortal Wonder, my love.

1:00:37.973 --> 1:00:40.139
The ancient artforms
are far more powerful

1:00:40.141 --> 1:00:42.575
than today's chants.

1:00:42.577 --> 1:00:45.814
My "Poison Flower", my "Daughter of Demons",

1:00:47.015 --> 1:00:48.550
our time has arrived.

1:00:49.985 --> 1:00:54.055
You've worked long and hard
for this day, haven't we?

1:00:55.490 --> 1:00:58.326
The day when we can finally
say Yahzeel has arrived.

1:01:00.395 --> 1:01:01.596
Doesn't that sound good?

1:01:04.833 --> 1:01:07.536
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

1:01:09.304 --> 1:01:12.305
Those weak minded,
pretentious, bloated children

1:01:12.307 --> 1:01:14.741
we call the Supreme World Alliance

1:01:14.743 --> 1:01:18.011
never believed in the
threat of the Royal 4,

1:01:18.013 --> 1:01:19.447
nor the legacy of Yahzeel,

1:01:21.583 --> 1:01:24.219
but we did, didn't we?

1:01:27.055 --> 1:01:27.889
Yes.

1:01:28.757 --> 1:01:30.757
And tonight they will know what feels like

1:01:30.759 --> 1:01:32.894
to be on the other side of your blades

1:01:33.962 --> 1:01:35.263
Yes, my love.

1:02:15.036 --> 1:02:18.707
I see there is still
magic in these walls.

1:02:34.923 --> 1:02:37.192
Where are you, Mr. Orin?

1:02:40.795 --> 1:02:42.897
You couldn't gone far without.

1:02:51.339 --> 1:02:53.775
I wonder, has he come across?

1:03:07.989 --> 1:03:09.224
Thanks to Mother,

1:03:10.258 --> 1:03:12.925
someone has finally come to save me.

1:03:12.927 --> 1:03:16.798
Sir, I haven't eaten for so long

1:03:17.966 --> 1:03:18.867
and I'm so hungry.

1:03:20.368 --> 1:03:22.669
I've been hiding from Sil's goons for-

1:03:53.034 --> 1:03:55.234
Concede, baby,

1:03:55.236 --> 1:03:57.038
I can feel you want me.

1:03:57.939 --> 1:04:01.276
I want you, but I need
you to relax, darling.

1:04:02.210 --> 1:04:05.580
I want the pleasure of
hearing your screams

1:04:06.614 --> 1:04:08.183
as I dine on your flesh.

1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:14.589
I really hate you

1:04:16.224 --> 1:04:17.792
Scavengers!

1:04:33.241 --> 1:04:35.508
You scavengers are fucking disgusting.

1:04:35.510 --> 1:04:37.312
Tell me, where is the the boy.

1:04:39.114 --> 1:04:41.681
There is none boy here.

1:04:41.683 --> 1:04:43.585
But I know you, Juken Erstinrue.

1:04:45.220 --> 1:04:46.986
Get out of my head.

1:04:46.988 --> 1:04:48.423
Stop reading my thoughts!

1:04:49.624 --> 1:04:51.290
Tell me, where is he?

1:04:51.292 --> 1:04:52.694
I know he was here.

1:04:53.595 --> 1:04:55.797
There is no one here but me, baby.

1:04:57.065 --> 1:05:00.433
Relax, concede to me,

1:05:00.435 --> 1:05:03.471
I promise I'm gonna eat you quick.

1:05:05.073 --> 1:05:07.409
Did you kill him, tell me!

1:05:11.613 --> 1:05:15.683
Leave him alone, I'm
not finished with him yet.

1:05:24.259 --> 1:05:25.093
A Guard

1:05:29.063 --> 1:05:30.865
Hey, don't move.

1:05:41.609 --> 1:05:44.045
Keep pressure on it, you know the drill.

1:05:45.013 --> 1:05:46.445
Thanks.

1:05:46.447 --> 1:05:47.382
What's your name?

1:05:49.851 --> 1:05:51.918
Kavyian Sho, yours?

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:53.986
Juken Erstinrue.

1:05:53.988 --> 1:05:55.721
Who you assigned to?

1:05:55.723 --> 1:05:59.125
Lieutenant Kryst, a
Vampian from the west, you?

1:05:59.127 --> 1:06:00.295
Captain Tull,

1:06:01.296 --> 1:06:05.031
A Soul-Anger from the east, fucking coward.

1:06:05.033 --> 1:06:06.098
Where is he?

1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:07.667
I don't know.

1:06:07.669 --> 1:06:11.504
He ran off when a group of
scavengers jumped us from behind.

1:06:11.506 --> 1:06:13.973
He wouldn't have gotten far.

1:06:13.975 --> 1:06:15.107
How is it you survived?

1:06:15.109 --> 1:06:17.712
Scavengers are not known
to keep anything alive.

1:06:18.546 --> 1:06:20.246
It didn't.

1:06:20.248 --> 1:06:21.414
The female was about to feed on me

1:06:21.416 --> 1:06:23.182
until she heard you come in.

1:06:23.184 --> 1:06:25.051
So, thanks.

1:06:25.053 --> 1:06:27.288
You don't have to
worry about her anymore.

1:06:28.690 --> 1:06:29.722
Let me ask you something,

1:06:29.724 --> 1:06:31.357
did you see a young guy come through here

1:06:31.359 --> 1:06:32.892
with a green sweater?

1:06:32.894 --> 1:06:34.126
No.

1:06:34.128 --> 1:06:35.494
What is he, your mark?

1:06:35.496 --> 1:06:36.331
Yeah.

1:06:38.199 --> 1:06:39.434
Can you get up?

1:06:40.368 --> 1:06:41.436
I think so.

1:06:50.378 --> 1:06:54.614
Hey guys,
are you here to save me?

1:06:54.616 --> 1:06:57.049
I haven't eaten in days.

1:06:57.051 --> 1:07:00.455
Please help me, I'll do anything for you.

1:07:02.457 --> 1:07:04.090
Can you fight?

1:07:04.092 --> 1:07:05.827
Yes, I can fight.

1:07:07.795 --> 1:07:09.862
We know what you are, Scavenger.

1:07:09.864 --> 1:07:11.864
So why don't you go back into you hole

1:07:11.866 --> 1:07:13.968
or end up like your girlfriend over here?

1:07:18.106 --> 1:07:20.039
What format do you suggest?

1:07:20.041 --> 1:07:21.807
For this big bastard,

1:07:21.809 --> 1:07:24.479
let's do format 43, set 90.

1:07:31.719 --> 1:07:34.322
Let's change that, full 60, set 80.

1:07:35.823 --> 1:07:37.390
Yeah, agree.

1:08:38.486 --> 1:08:40.722
Juken, we need to end this.

1:08:42.857 --> 1:08:43.691
I know.

1:08:49.631 --> 1:08:52.133
I need time to build my chant.

1:09:01.909 --> 1:09:07.782
Bysaleen-Ro-Bythin-Ge-Ilstrin

1:09:10.418 --> 1:09:12.453
Ahhh!

1:09:28.403 --> 1:09:29.404
Die already.

1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:39.714
I'll tell you,

1:09:40.648 --> 1:09:42.848
these scavengers are getting
harder to kill nowadays.

1:09:42.850 --> 1:09:43.951
Yeah, they are.

1:09:45.319 --> 1:09:46.752
How you feeling?

1:09:46.754 --> 1:09:48.020
Tired.

1:09:48.022 --> 1:09:48.856
Me too.

1:09:50.258 --> 1:09:53.059
This is not the kind of day I had in mind,

1:09:53.061 --> 1:09:54.994
but thank you for helping me with this.

1:09:54.996 --> 1:09:56.462
Well, you did

1:09:56.464 --> 1:09:59.098
lure me away from the
female scavenger earlier.

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:01.169
Well, it worked out for the both of us.

1:10:02.837 --> 1:10:04.972
Hey, stay still, relax.

1:10:06.407 --> 1:10:07.973
Let me look around for something
to mend that wound of yours

1:10:07.975 --> 1:10:10.545
so you can get out of here
and back to base, huh?

1:10:11.679 --> 1:10:13.414
See if you can find some water too.

1:10:42.043 --> 1:10:46.013
Well boy, it seems you
found the Resistance.

1:10:55.356 --> 1:10:56.290
Hey, Croathian.

1:10:58.359 --> 1:11:00.860
Hey, sire, feeling better?

1:11:00.862 --> 1:11:02.428
Somewhat.

1:11:02.430 --> 1:11:04.930
Though much has changed
since I've been away,

1:11:04.932 --> 1:11:06.565
I've got much to catch up on,

1:11:06.567 --> 1:11:08.903
otherwise, feeling more in control.

1:11:09.971 --> 1:11:11.072
That's good to hear.

1:11:12.073 --> 1:11:14.173
You know, I wanted to thank you

1:11:14.175 --> 1:11:16.308
for what you did for me back there.

1:11:16.310 --> 1:11:17.910
If you didn't arrive when you did,

1:11:17.912 --> 1:11:19.814
those women would have surely killed me.

1:11:20.982 --> 1:11:22.681
Of course, sire, it's my duty.

1:11:22.683 --> 1:11:24.950
And I thank you for not
killing me back there

1:11:24.952 --> 1:11:26.320
for treating you like shit.

1:11:27.221 --> 1:11:29.688
It's all right,
Lieutenant, you didn't know.

1:11:29.690 --> 1:11:31.025
Shit, I didn't know either.

1:11:32.293 --> 1:11:34.727
You know, if it wasn't for Sofia,

1:11:34.729 --> 1:11:36.729
I'd still be creating spreadsheets

1:11:36.731 --> 1:11:39.000
and business plans while
my true world burns.

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:43.402
That's a good woman you
guys have there, Tenan,

1:11:43.404 --> 1:11:45.905
and you're fortunate to
have her as your leader.

1:11:45.907 --> 1:11:49.475
Yes, sire, we are, but
we all follow you now.

1:11:49.477 --> 1:11:51.977
And I appreciate that Lieutenant,

1:11:51.979 --> 1:11:53.946
but we are a team first

1:11:53.948 --> 1:11:55.383
and we follow what is right.

1:11:56.350 --> 1:12:00.021
What we must do now is bring
back balance to our Mother.

1:12:01.155 --> 1:12:05.658
And I promise you,
Tenan, we will win this.

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:09.228
I will find Sil and all of his followers

1:12:09.230 --> 1:12:11.030
and bathe in their screams

1:12:11.032 --> 1:12:14.068
as I feel their bones crush
in the palm of my hands.

1:12:15.169 --> 1:12:17.136
Do you hear me, brother?

1:12:17.138 --> 1:12:18.204
Yes.

1:12:18.206 --> 1:12:19.106
Blood for blood.

1:12:20.141 --> 1:12:21.042
Blood for blood.

1:12:23.211 --> 1:12:25.945
I see Croathians haven't
lost their thirst for battle.

1:12:25.947 --> 1:12:28.516
No, sir, we haven't.

1:12:30.618 --> 1:12:34.019
I've seen that look far
too many times, Lieutenant.

1:12:34.021 --> 1:12:34.855
When did she die?

1:12:36.123 --> 1:12:37.592
When did they die, sire.

1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:40.761
It was two years from yesterday.

1:12:42.730 --> 1:12:43.931
What were their names?

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.535
Tygan and Valada.

1:12:48.402 --> 1:12:49.237
What happened?

1:12:50.071 --> 1:12:51.806
When Sil's invasion began.

1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:55.140
I hid my family beneath
the royal building,

1:12:55.142 --> 1:12:56.544
in a room built for war.

1:12:57.612 --> 1:13:00.779
It was designed to house
over a thousand beings

1:13:00.781 --> 1:13:04.216
for up to a year, many
of Murs's top soldiers,

1:13:04.218 --> 1:13:07.555
doctors, and communication
specialists to look over them.

1:13:08.656 --> 1:13:09.957
I knew they were safe!

1:13:10.891 --> 1:13:15.361
So me, Sofia, 80,000 of our soldiers

1:13:15.363 --> 1:13:17.999
ran to the wall to face Sil's monsters.

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.103
We were ready to show them what
it meant to battle an army of Murs.

1:13:23.471 --> 1:13:25.740
After a few hours it
seemed as if we had won,

1:13:26.841 --> 1:13:29.141
the field was filled with smoke,

1:13:29.143 --> 1:13:30.878
the ground bled for miles.

1:13:33.114 --> 1:13:34.348
Many of us still stood.

1:13:36.851 --> 1:13:38.886
Then I hear Sofia yelling for me.

1:13:39.787 --> 1:13:43.122
I turned to see the back of
the royal building in flames.

1:13:43.124 --> 1:13:44.492
That is where the room was.

1:13:45.826 --> 1:13:48.027
Me and Sofia ran as fast as we could,

1:13:48.029 --> 1:13:51.196
over countless bodies of
our own people, to see.

1:13:51.198 --> 1:13:54.667
Somehow Sil's monsters
had ripped the door apart.

1:13:54.669 --> 1:13:56.869
We searched it, searched for survivors,

1:13:56.871 --> 1:13:59.273
but all we saw were
bodies laying everywhere.

1:14:01.275 --> 1:14:04.510
And there they were, my two babies,

1:14:04.512 --> 1:14:07.581
huddled together, covered in ash.

1:14:09.350 --> 1:14:11.350
I went over to touch them,

1:14:11.352 --> 1:14:15.856
and as I did they just
fell apart, to dust.

1:14:17.391 --> 1:14:18.357
Sil must've been using

1:14:18.359 --> 1:14:21.095
an ancient artform you couldn't
have been prepared for.

1:14:22.496 --> 1:14:24.131
You know, the scariest part is,

1:14:25.166 --> 1:14:28.135
there are times that I cannot
remember what they look like.

1:14:29.370 --> 1:14:31.470
What kind of husband and father am I

1:14:31.472 --> 1:14:34.340
that I can forget what
they fucking looked like?

1:14:34.342 --> 1:14:35.808
You will never forget, Tenan,

1:14:35.810 --> 1:14:37.511
you will never forget.

1:14:39.513 --> 1:14:42.550
They always live right
here and right here.

1:14:43.718 --> 1:14:45.619
See them and feel them.

1:14:47.455 --> 1:14:48.289
Let me show you.

1:14:51.092 --> 1:14:55.096
Kom-Bu-Lay-Fay-Veezin-His-Love.

1:15:01.035 --> 1:15:01.969
Hey guys.

1:15:03.437 --> 1:15:06.805
Damn, this salty air
really dries up a girl.

1:15:46.046 --> 1:15:50.217
Now you see, Tenan, you
haven't forgotten a thing.

1:15:51.619 --> 1:15:54.422
That image pulled straight
from your consciousness.

1:15:55.890 --> 1:16:00.292
That Croathian fire you
hold deep down in your soul,

1:16:00.294 --> 1:16:03.062
keeps the essence of your family alive.

1:16:03.064 --> 1:16:06.767
And you lose that and you'll
truly lose them forever.

1:16:07.902 --> 1:16:10.604
Yes, sire, I won't forget again.

1:16:11.972 --> 1:16:12.807
Good.

1:16:14.408 --> 1:16:16.877
Sire, Tenan, was that your family?

1:16:17.878 --> 1:16:19.511
Yes, it was.

1:16:19.513 --> 1:16:21.513
Oh man, sire, you
totally got to do me next

1:16:21.515 --> 1:16:22.981
because there's people I wanna see too.

1:16:22.983 --> 1:16:26.819
Like, oh, there was this prince,
oh my God, he was so fine.

1:16:26.821 --> 1:16:29.054
Oh, he can totally have me any time.

1:16:29.056 --> 1:16:31.091
But he, like, talked, like, all the time.

1:16:38.566 --> 1:16:40.801
Whoa, what have I missed?

1:16:41.735 --> 1:16:42.568
Oh, you know what,

1:16:42.570 --> 1:16:44.136
there was this fucking
tyrant that I killed

1:16:44.138 --> 1:16:45.571
from the city of Torbin,

1:16:45.573 --> 1:16:49.074
and then I stole all
his precious collection-

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:53.712
What was that?

1:16:53.714 --> 1:16:55.216
Sil's killing squads.

1:16:55.716 --> 1:16:58.152
So you want to fight an Neptonian king?

1:17:00.654 --> 1:17:01.555
BLADE TO FLAME!

1:17:03.657 --> 1:17:06.327
GWAR-ZOW-TO-BOR-NYE-TO-FLAME!
