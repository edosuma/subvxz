WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.604
- A Pop original series.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.508
[energetic brass music]

00:07.541 --> 00:09.077
*

00:09.110 --> 00:11.512
- Well, I did it.
I nailed Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.581
- Oh.
- She's on the show tonight.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.717
And it's not because
we look alike.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.556
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.459
We also have Jim Norton--
very funny, dirty comedian.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.527
- Good.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.596
- And, uh, Lip-Synch Kerfuffle.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.598
- [laughs] That Kerfuffle
is funny!

00:30.631 --> 00:32.766
- That Kerfuffle is just another
Fallon rip-off.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.203
- Um, what the hell
are you wearing?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.437
- Thank you, Marcus.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.672
I bought this dress on Goop.
- Ooh.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.641
Love it.
- Can I just say,

00:40.674 --> 00:42.810
I love how playful you've been

00:42.843 --> 00:44.478
lately with your wardrobe.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.280
- Thank you. Red belt.
- Lovin' it.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.183
- Uh, what am I doing here?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.784
- Oh. Ana. Yes.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.286
I think Marcus
is gonna need help

00:52.320 --> 00:53.621
with Gwyneth Paltrow's hair.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.123
- I only do Jimmy.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.425
- Yes, but Jimmy's hair
takes two minutes,

00:57.458 --> 01:00.294
and otherwise,
you don't do anything.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.296
- Read my contract.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.631
- I can do it.
- No.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.333
You will not touch
Gwyneth Paltrow.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.834
- I might.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.869
- Anyway, Gwyneth is bringing
her publicist Malik.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.471
[bangs on table]
I know, Penny.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.705
She's a bitch.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.607
But she's a powerful
uber-bitch,

01:13.641 --> 01:15.809
and she reps most of the stars
that come on the show,

01:15.843 --> 01:17.845
so can we not piss her off?

01:17.878 --> 01:19.713
- What are you guys doing?

01:19.747 --> 01:22.283
Is this a meeting?
- Yes, Phil.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.152
- Was I supposed to be
in this meeting?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.453
- Yes, Phil.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.820
- Well, good thing I'm here.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.123
- Well, and now that
we are all here,

01:29.157 --> 01:30.491
I have an issue to raise.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.794
There is a unidentified
piece of...

01:33.827 --> 01:36.864
fecal matter in the green room,

01:36.897 --> 01:38.699
and I cannot do my job

01:38.732 --> 01:40.501
and serve food until
someone cleans it up.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.137
- Yeah, I was wondering when
someone was gonna bring this up.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.906
- Okay, hold on: you both
saw the fecal matter,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.408
and you didn't do anything
about it?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.642
- Well, I wanted
to leave it for you.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.877
I know you love
solving problems.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.345
Isn't that your thing?

01:51.379 --> 01:52.880
- Randy, why don't you
pick up the poop?

01:52.913 --> 01:54.382
- I do sound, and that would be,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.284
like, a union issue.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.687
- Okay, well, somebody's
got to deal with this shit.

02:02.690 --> 02:06.427
announcer: From Studio 9B
in the heart of New York City,

02:06.460 --> 02:09.263
it's "Nightcap With Jimmy."

02:09.297 --> 02:11.565
Tonight: Goops,
she did it again.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.801
Gwyneth Paltrow.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.703
The bald and the beautiful
comedian

02:15.736 --> 02:17.838
Jim Norton.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.473
Everyone's favorite
late night game,

02:19.507 --> 02:21.942
Lip-Synch Kerfuffle.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.545
And now, the man who's
number five in the ratings

02:24.578 --> 02:26.680
but number one in our hearts,

02:26.714 --> 02:28.582
here's Jimmy!

02:28.616 --> 02:32.653
*

02:34.222 --> 02:36.890
- Well, that could be anything.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.193
- No, it's definitely feces,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.195
and it is definitely human.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.696
I've examined enough
human stool

02:42.730 --> 02:45.266
to know,
thank you, Dr. Oz.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.601
- You know, she's right.
That is human poop.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.638
It's actually homeless
Pan-Asian poop.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.473
- How could you possibly
know that?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.941
- Because a homeless
Vietnamese man

02:53.974 --> 02:55.643
used to live in my hallway.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.945
I'm sorry,
defecated in my hallway.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.413
- We only have two
Asian employees.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.814
We could just round them up.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.684
- Okay, FDR, we're not gonna
round up the Asians.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.619
- Or it could be a dog.
[dog groans]

03:05.653 --> 03:09.357
- Hey, there you are, buddy.
[laughs]

03:09.390 --> 03:10.958
- Um, Todd, who's this dog?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.560
- This is Monty.
This is Jimmy's dog.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.495
- What is Jimmy's dog
doing here?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.763
- Oh, he was
wreaking havoc upstairs.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.698
It was just, like,
a complete disaster.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.668
We called him "Hurricane Monty."

03:20.701 --> 03:22.770
It was just--I mean,
it was a mess.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.372
So during the day, he's gonna
be down here.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.839
- Oh, so he's just supposed
to destroy

03:25.873 --> 03:28.509
and shit on everything here
in my department?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.910
- Yeah, probably.
That's what he does.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.247
- Todd, where is this dog
supposed to stay?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.448
- Oh, they're building out
an office

03:34.482 --> 03:35.816
for him as we speak.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.785
- What office?
- The one across from you guys.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.987
- Penny and I have been sharing
the same office for months.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.623
You're telling me there's
another office on our floor?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.458
- Yeah, well, it's, uh,
occupied.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.526
By Monty.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.762
So, unavailable.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.032
- Anyway, here we are.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.734
- Fuck yeah.
This is nice.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.637
- Nicer than usual.
I see you took my notes.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.838
- Gwyneth, I've just got to say,

03:57.871 --> 03:59.373
we are so excited
to have you here.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.974
- That's so funny!

04:01.008 --> 04:02.643
- Oh. [laughs]

04:02.676 --> 04:04.445
It's a dress
I bought on Goop.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.780
- Yeah. It's a nightshirt.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.349
- Oh.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.850
- But it's cute.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.686
Oh, coffee.
Thank you so much.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.021
- Who else is on
this show tonight?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.457
- Um, Jim--Jim Norton.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.625
- Oh, yeah.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.527
He's that, like, um,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.061
little kind of pervy bald--

04:21.094 --> 04:23.063
that guy's hilarious.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.798
Wait, did I fuck that guy?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.568
- Not yet.
- Mm!

04:27.601 --> 04:28.869
I love that pillow.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.971
That would look so good
in my apartment.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.807
And that little candy dish too.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.709
That's really nice.
- Um...

04:35.743 --> 04:37.811
That pillow actually
goes with that couch.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.748
The couch that lives
in the office.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.815
- And I'm also gonna need

04:41.849 --> 04:43.784
a really warm washcloth, please.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.486
- Oh, God.
Do you have a headache?

04:45.519 --> 04:46.987
- Well, I just didn't
have time to shower,

04:47.020 --> 04:49.923
so I need, like,
whore's bath.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.559
- A whore's--
- Whore's bath.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.361
- If I might interrupt.
Ms. Paltrow.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.928
Excuse me.
- Food.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.499
I prepared your snacks today
from the recipes of Goop.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.868
- What is that shit?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.870
[sighs] Didn't you guys
read my rider?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.839
I can't eat that.
I need carbs, bitch!

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
- The one time I make an effort

05:07.575 --> 05:09.543
for this stupid, stupid show.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.011
- Oh, okay.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.381
And I'm gonna need
some hamburgers too, okay?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.849
Meat.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.586
Well--
well, let's take that tray,

05:18.619 --> 05:19.853
'cause it's really cute,

05:19.887 --> 05:22.756
and to throw it away
for no reason...

05:22.790 --> 05:23.857
- I'm so sorry about the chef.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.793
He's a angry little gnome.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.861
- [sighs]

05:27.895 --> 05:28.862
Oh, yeah.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.130
Um, do you have an outlet?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.832
'Cause I need to steam
my vagina.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.134
both: Oh.
- Yes.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.103
- And my nails might
still be wet,

05:36.136 --> 05:38.806
so can you unzip my pants?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.108
- Sure.

05:41.141 --> 05:44.845
- It's a back zipper.
both: Oh.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.147
- There you go.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.882
- Hey, Nate, I think
Jimmy'll want

05:48.916 --> 05:50.884
one of those paintings with
the dogs playing poker

05:50.918 --> 05:52.853
somewhere--I don't know--
right around there.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.423
- Yeah, the humor's gonna be
lost on the dog, though.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.890
- Wait, that painting's
supposed to be funny?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.559
- I did this, like,
very sort of

05:58.592 --> 06:01.128
modern, kind of Warhol-esque
portrait.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.796
He likes that much more.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.932
- I know, well then get her
cheddar cheese popcorn.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.167
Oh, wow. Wow.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.469
Nate!
- Hi.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.803
How are you?

06:09.837 --> 06:11.138
- Yeah, it's Nate Berkus.
- I know.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.607
- Yeah, from the Oprah.
- I know Nate.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.142
Hi.
- It's really good to see you.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.544
- Good to see you.
- How is everything?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.545
Uh, it's great.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.680
Um, what are you doing here?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.181
- I got the Monty job.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.651
- [gasps]
- I know. Unbelievable.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.785
Everybody in the design
community

06:24.818 --> 06:26.186
was angling for this.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.588
Michael Smith?
Hey dude,

06:27.621 --> 06:28.922
you might have done
the White House,

06:28.956 --> 06:31.124
but you're not doing
Monty's space--I am.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.461
There's absolutely
no budget limit.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.195
I mean, I can spend
anything I want.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.598
It's been a while since I've
been able to ship

06:37.631 --> 06:39.633
one side table from France

06:39.667 --> 06:41.802
and just, you know, whatever,
like, on a plane.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.971
Like, it cost more than the
table to even get it here,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.473
you--anyway, I'm boring you.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.708
How are you?
- I'm--I'm dumbfounded.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.577
I truly am dumbfounded.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.111
- Do you have a second?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.746
I know you're probably really,
like, swamped today.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.781
- Yes.
- You do. Okay.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.215
Just--it's one minute.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.717
Obviously, I've been spending
a ton of time

06:56.750 --> 06:58.686
with my client--hey, bud!

06:58.719 --> 07:00.120
We are so close now.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.689
It's really important, like,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.991
the decorator-client bond thing,
'cause like,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.126
people have to really feel
at one in their space,

07:06.159 --> 07:08.562
so I think he's a winter.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.531
What do you think about that?
That feels right, right?

07:10.564 --> 07:12.199
- Well, I feel like
he's a dog,

07:12.232 --> 07:14.568
but if he were to be
a season,

07:14.602 --> 07:15.869
I think yeah, he's somewhere--

07:15.903 --> 07:17.738
- Yeah, okay,
so he's a winter.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.807
We agree he's a winter.
I'm gonna go with this.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.776
- Uh, I'm gonna just go Krazy
Glue my desk back together--

07:22.810 --> 07:23.944
- Okay.
- It's good to see you.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.978
- Yes, you too, Nate.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.216
- So back to that painting.
Why is it funny?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.984
- Can you just go?
Seriously.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.723
- Welcome back to
"The Konspiracy Korner."

07:35.756 --> 07:37.224
- The podcast where we agree
with each other

07:37.257 --> 07:38.692
about conspiracies.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.927
- I am your host,
Randy Wolf.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
- I'm your host, Grady DuPont.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.064
Last time, we proved
without a shadow of a doubt

07:44.097 --> 07:47.935
that Jay Z and Beyoncé are the
leaders of the Illuminati.

07:47.968 --> 07:52.039
- This week: is Katy Perry
actually JonBenét Ramsey?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.141
- Oh, my God. Is she?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.843
- Yes. Yes.
She really is.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.611
Just look at the eyebrows.
They're identical.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.279
- Well, now we have
to stop recording

07:59.312 --> 08:01.148
because our listeners
are not familiar

08:01.181 --> 08:03.751
with someone's shrill voice
and it breaks the reality.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.985
- Sorry.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.587
- Why are you sitting like that?

08:06.620 --> 08:09.690
- I'm draining the toxins
from my feet and legs

08:09.723 --> 08:11.859
into my kidneys
so that they can filter out

08:11.892 --> 08:13.260
the negative energy.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.028
- There's no scientific merit
to that.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.565
- Maybe not, but the past
seven or eight years,

08:17.598 --> 08:20.167
I've just had
a string of bad luck.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.070
This morning,
I got on the subway,

08:23.103 --> 08:25.639
made eyes at
a handsome gentleman,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.808
and he masturbated at me.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.110
I inadvertently killed a pigeon,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.245
and I was hit by a car,

08:32.279 --> 08:34.682
and now they're suing.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.651
- That's really unlucky.
- That's a bad day.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.688
- Yeah.
- Penny, you know what you need?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.623
You need to rub
a hunchback's hump.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.292
- What?
I have never heard that before.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.127
- Yes, according to ancient
Jewish tradition,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.229
if you rub a hunchback's hump,
it brings good luck.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.164
- That's true. I'm half Jewish.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.633
- Does this really work?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.201
- Well, I rubbed
a hunchback's hump

08:54.234 --> 08:56.670
when my neighbor's cockatoo
had cancer,

08:56.704 --> 08:58.305
and it died three weeks later.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.608
- Oh.
So it doesn't work.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.175
- Oh, no. It worked.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.645
Worked very well.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.714
- I think you remember from
the last time you were here,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.582
for "Country Strong,"
Jimmy doesn't actually

09:08.616 --> 09:10.350
remember a lot of the things
he's gonna--

09:10.383 --> 09:12.886
- I'm just gonna wing it, okay?
- Okay.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.154
- Do you need me
to give you a minute

09:14.187 --> 09:15.689
to finish that fried chicken?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.190
- No. It's fine, dude.
I'm a pro.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.326
Just--let's do this.
- Okay.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.061
I got to tell you, I love

09:21.094 --> 09:22.663
your makeup line from Goop.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.332
That natural mascara?
Dead!

09:25.365 --> 09:27.034
- Goop has a makeup line?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.335
- Yup.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.370
You've been doing press
about it everywhere.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.371
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.040
- How about kids?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.675
Any funny story about the kids,
or is that off-limits?

09:34.708 --> 09:37.044
- She said she's gonna wing it.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
- Okay, I got the microwave

09:39.112 --> 09:40.748
that you liked
from our kitchen.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.650
I just ripped it out
from the wall.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.918
- Awesome, you can just set it
right over there.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.286
That's fine.
- I'm sorry.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.055
That's from our kitchen?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.356
- Oh, my God.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.391
Have you guys ever put
marshmallow Peeps

09:51.424 --> 09:52.726
in a microwave?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.361
They fucking explode!

09:54.394 --> 09:55.996
[sparse laughter]

09:56.029 --> 09:58.966
It's better high, but still.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.301
- Should we all get high?

10:04.872 --> 10:08.308
[lively trumpet music]

10:08.341 --> 10:10.644
- No, those are pantaloons.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.145
Trousers are fitted.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.413
- 'Cause I think I just
got pantaloons on--

10:13.446 --> 10:15.148
- Staci? Uh...

10:15.182 --> 10:17.217
Do you remember that sweet
brown leather jacket

10:17.250 --> 10:18.952
I wore when I was
coming in today?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.688
- Yes, it's all I've been
thinking about, Jim.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.689
- Really?
- No.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.223
- Why you being sarcastic?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.758
Because I'm a comic, right?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.359
Because you think
I can take it?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.829
'Cause you think I'm small
and disgusting?

10:28.862 --> 10:32.165
- Yes, but I do want to help you
find that leather jacket.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.402
- Well, it was in my dressing
room, and now it's gone.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.905
So, I don't want to be that guy,
but I think somebody stole it.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.940
- Okay, Jim, first of all,
you'll never be that guy,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.809
and second of all, we are going
to put the word out,

10:41.842 --> 10:43.243
and we'll find out
what happened to it.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.945
- All right. Thank you.
It's a men's petite.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.848
- Of course it is.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.950
- I think I know
who stole the jacket.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.284
- Well, it's kind of obvious.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.419
- Do you want to both say

10:52.452 --> 10:54.354
who we think it is
at the count of three?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.923
- Gwyneth Paltrow.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.725
- That's exactly
who I was gonna say.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.865
- So, this is an office
for a dog.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.800
- Well, it's not just--I mean,
it's a living

11:06.834 --> 11:08.268
and workspace for Montgomery,

11:08.301 --> 11:09.703
who happens to be a dog.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.705
- When I was little, I slept
in a cardboard box

11:11.739 --> 11:14.007
with my brother
for four years.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.242
- That's, like, the most
depressing thing

11:15.275 --> 11:16.243
I've ever heard.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.378
- But this--all of this--

11:18.411 --> 11:19.713
is for a dog.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.348
- Well, he's not just any dog.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.784
He's a rich man's dog.
[dog growling]

11:23.817 --> 11:26.053
- I wish I were
a rich man's dog.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.054
- Me too.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.288
Then I could pee on the street

11:28.321 --> 11:30.490
and no one would arrest me.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.159
[dog grunting]

11:32.192 --> 11:34.327
- I'm bored.
Jimmy's in his isolation room.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.729
What are you guys scheming?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.097
- We're trying to find
a hunchback.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.298
- Oh, to rub for good luck?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.968
- Yes. You've heard of this?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.803
- I'm foreign, not stupid.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.305
- I think we've, um,
found our hunchback.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.741
The, uh, gentleman over there.

11:47.775 --> 11:48.942
- You got this, Pen.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.011
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Do it.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.045
- You can do this, Pen.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.351
[both mouthing words]

12:00.988 --> 12:02.455
- I can't just touch it.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.091
- Yeah, we need to work
on your confidence first,

12:04.124 --> 12:05.458
and then we'll get you
back out there.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.394
Don't worry.
- Uh, no, it's not okay.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.996
She's a failure.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.431
And this is exactly why
I cannot respect you.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.969
- Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.304
Nobody respects her.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.809
- That's why I will never
trust a woman.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.211
- Hey, guys.
Uh, you seen a jacket?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.513
It's a brown jacket, got some
patches on the sleeves,

12:26.546 --> 12:28.515
a very stiff collar,
a lot of character.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.018
- Yes, actually I have seen
many brown jackets.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.252
- Oh, God damn it.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.021
Are you one of these
pompous jizz buckets

12:34.054 --> 12:36.456
who thinks it's kind of fun
to play little word riddle games

12:36.489 --> 12:37.524
because it makes you feel
superior

12:37.557 --> 12:38.992
about your own shitty life?

12:39.026 --> 12:41.194
- I am not a jizz bucket--
- You are.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.963
- My life is fine--
- It's not.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.933
- And I am morally superior--
- It's not worth it.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.400
- It's not worth it.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.036
- Are you looking
for a jacket?

12:49.069 --> 12:50.403
- Yeah.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.939
- I think I know
what happened to it.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.307
- Really?
Who are you?

12:54.341 --> 12:55.308
- Me?
- Yeah.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.810
- I'm Randy.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.211
- All right, what happened
to my jacket, Randy?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.546
- Gwyneth Paltrow stole it.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.148
- Um, all right.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.950
That's kind of a big,
weird accusation.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.184
What makes you say that?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.954
- I do sound. I hear things.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.989
And eavesdropping
is kind of my deal.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.457
- I understand that,
but why

13:10.490 --> 13:14.294
would Gwyneth Paltrow
steal a man's jacket?

13:14.327 --> 13:16.363
- Because she steals everything.
- Come on, man.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.999
If you listen to people,
every celebrity's a thief.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.869
- No, that's gay.
- Yes. Every celebrity is gay.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.972
- Are you sure Gwyneth Paltrow
took my jacket?

13:25.005 --> 13:28.208
- Jim, I am 100% sure.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.443
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- That's gonna be awkward.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.279
- Oh, an awkward,
shitty conversation.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.381
That'd be a real rarity
around here, wouldn't it?

13:34.414 --> 13:37.117
*

13:59.172 --> 14:01.074
- What are you doing?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.609
- I'm sorry.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.545
I was rubbing your hunchback
for good luck.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.614
- I'm not a hunchback.

14:07.647 --> 14:11.184
Oh. That's my hoodie.
It's inside out.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.987
- I can't find
a hunchback anywhere.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.123
And I'm not getting
back on that subway

14:16.156 --> 14:17.124
until I have better luck.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.525
- Look, young lady,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.360
I don't know
what you're talking about,

14:20.393 --> 14:23.931
but I hope you find the
hunchback you're looking for.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.265
- Thanks.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.266
High five?

14:26.299 --> 14:29.369
- No thanks.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.238
- I love that jacket.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.539
- Thank you.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.141
- Where'd you get it?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.442
- Um...

14:35.475 --> 14:38.078
I don't know. I just got it.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.546
- Okay, um,

14:39.579 --> 14:42.449
the thing is that
Jim Norton, uh,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.252
he thinks you might have
"Just gotten it"

14:45.285 --> 14:46.519
out of his dressing room.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.155
He says it's his jacket,
and it--

14:48.188 --> 14:51.291
it's kind of illegal,
and he wants it back.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.326
- Um...no. You know what?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.129
I got this jacket
from the air marshal

14:56.163 --> 14:58.665
that I blew on the way here.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.267
- Well, he's gonna
call the police.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.202
- The air marshal's gonna
call the police?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.536
That was a good blow job.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.073
I used my hands and everything.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.207
- I'm sure you did.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.276
Jim Norton is gonna
call the police.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.578
- Okay.
See, now you just set it off.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.346
- What--I did what--what?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.515
- Did you just throw shade
at my client?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.417
- I don't know--
- You better pick that shade up

15:17.450 --> 15:19.119
off of her and put it
onto yourself.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.287
Because you have no power here.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.654
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.690
You just run around here
looking all Busy Phillips,

15:23.723 --> 15:25.458
but this here, Ms. Paltrow,

15:25.492 --> 15:28.595
is a star,
and if she wants a jacket,

15:28.628 --> 15:30.998
then she gets the jacket.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.033
- What about Jim Norton?
- Oh.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.634
You can tell that pale,
sexually confused,

15:34.667 --> 15:36.636
neo-Nazi-looking motherfucker

15:36.669 --> 15:39.272
that if he says one word
to Gwyneth Paltrow,

15:39.306 --> 15:41.508
I will end him personally,
and he won't even

15:41.541 --> 15:43.110
be able to get a job
sweeping floors

15:43.143 --> 15:45.045
at the Mason County Chuckle Hut!

15:45.078 --> 15:46.346
You can go now.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.581
- Oh.
- Bye, Felicia.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.651
- Uh--
- Bye!

15:51.684 --> 15:53.653
*

15:53.686 --> 15:55.388
- We looked everywhere
for the jacket.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.224
- All over.
- We can't find it.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.491
- I know it's here.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.393
Gwyneth Paltrow took my jacket.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.029
- Well...
[sighs]

16:02.062 --> 16:04.464
Why do you think Gwyneth Paltrow
took your jacket?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.599
- Because your creepy
sound guy told me.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.101
- Okay, first of all,

16:08.135 --> 16:09.502
Randy is a compulsive liar,

16:09.536 --> 16:11.338
and you can't believe
anything he says.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.306
- Maybe not, but I can
believe my own eyes,

16:13.340 --> 16:16.376
and that dumb spindly bitch
posted it to Instagram.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.178
I knew she couldn't resist
taking a picture.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.546
White women
are very predictable.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.214
- We are very predictable.
It's true.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.716
- You follow Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Yeah, of course I do.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.585
How else is a guy like me
supposed to know

16:25.618 --> 16:27.520
where all the best spas
in Santa Fe are?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.556
- Well, if she did
have the jacket,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.524
it would maybe be
in a better place,

16:31.558 --> 16:33.360
on her beautiful back.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.328
- But it's my jacket--I know
it's not much to look at,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.097
it's kind of shitty and it's
stained and it's ripped,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.566
but it's mine, and that spoiled
bitch took it

16:39.599 --> 16:41.534
because she's used to getting
what she wants.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.036
Now, I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna rip it off

16:43.070 --> 16:44.504
her fuckin' Ichabod Crane body.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.607
- Jim Norton, don't go near
Gwyneth Paltrow.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.276
- Gwyneth Paltrow
stole my jacket.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.610
I'm going to get it.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.379
- If you even talk
to Gwyneth Paltrow,

16:52.412 --> 16:53.813
you will never come on
this show again.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
- Uch, who gives a shit?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.517
I'm only here today
'cause somebody cancelled.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.686
I make quite a good living
doing community colleges.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.222
- Fine, then you go out there
and do community colleges.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.057
- I'm not going anywhere.
It's my dressing room.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.658
You go.
- I...

17:05.692 --> 17:08.561
I'm going.
- Good.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.099
- I'm gone!

17:12.132 --> 17:13.633
- Want to see a picture
of my dick?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.602
*

17:20.673 --> 17:22.709
- So, wait. Who stole what?

17:22.742 --> 17:23.776
- [sighs]

17:23.810 --> 17:27.614
Gwyneth Paltrow
stole my jacket.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.848
- And why am I here?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.750
- Because you're security.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.820
- Oh, that's very flattering,
but I'm no detective.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.655
- Look, there's a serial thief
in the building,

17:35.688 --> 17:38.125
and she has my jacket,
and that idiot Staci

17:38.158 --> 17:39.826
is not helping me--
I need you.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.462
- I kind of don't want
any part of this.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.796
I wouldn't go in there.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.765
I'd just cut your losses
and go home.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.734
- Look, I don't have
a lot in my life.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.102
All right?
I'm not rich.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.703
I'm not particularly handsome.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.472
I'm not particularly tall.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.241
And my perpetually-limp dick

17:54.274 --> 17:55.842
leaves a lot to be desired.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.645
I have my pride,
and that jacket.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.447
And now I don't even
have that jacket.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.449
I have my limp dick,
and my pride.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.452
And I'm going to get my jacket.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.853
- I am trying to find you
some speedballs,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.622
but in the meantime, I need
to walk Jimmy's dog.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.558
He's a Mastiff, and he's got
a huge--

18:11.591 --> 18:12.725
- Cock?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.661
- Appetite, but yes,
probably that too.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.296
- Oh. [gasps]
- Gwyneth.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.865
- Jim Norton!
You fucking rock!

18:18.898 --> 18:20.567
- Don't try the
"I'm gonna compliment

18:20.600 --> 18:21.701
"the ugly little weird guy

18:21.734 --> 18:23.170
to get him on my side" shit.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.604
I'm not buying it.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.539
- You want to throw down, bitch?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.375
- No, I'm not gonna throw down.
I'm not a rapper in the '80s.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.243
I want my jacket.
- It's not your jacket.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.145
- Yeah, it is my jacket.
- No, it's not.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.880
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.416
- It is my jacket,
and you stole it.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.785
- Oh, no, I didn't.
This is my jacket.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.553
If this was your jacket,
you would be wearing it.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.222
I'm wearing it.
This is my jacket.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.557
- What are you, a sociopath?
That makes no sense.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.327
- Okay.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.162
You want a hand job?
- Yes.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.663
- Oh.
- You know what?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.599
Um, let's see if we can
make a deal here.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.900
- Thought we just
had a deal.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.636
- Aysha, what have we
got in the bag?

18:56.669 --> 18:59.439
Oh, we have a one-of-a-kind,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.741
signed guitar
by Bruce Springsteen.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.410
- Did you get that
from Jimmy's office?

19:03.443 --> 19:04.677
- Yeah.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.580
- All right.
So, the guitar and a hand job?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.749
- Just the guitar.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.452
Okay?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.854
- Well, I guess you got
yourself a deal, Paltrow.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.589
Enjoy my disgusting jacket.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.758
- Enjoy the guitar.
- No, I'm gonna sell the guitar.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.927
I would've enjoyed a hand job.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.497
[upbeat music]

19:24.531 --> 19:26.333
- So, I've got a car waiting
downstairs for you,

19:26.366 --> 19:29.669
so you can take your nap
before you get too cranky.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.671
- Oh, Gwyneth,
thank you so much.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.541
That was an amazing show.
- Thank you.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.909
Oh, my God.
Who is this?

19:36.943 --> 19:39.912
- This is Monty.
He's kind of the office dog.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.682
- Oh, my God. I love him.
- Oh, he...

19:42.715 --> 19:44.984
He loves you!
- Do you want that dog?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.686
'Cause we can take him
right now.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.389
- Oh, my God. No.
I mean, no!

19:49.422 --> 19:50.823
I'm not gonna take
the office dog, God.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.425
- Are you kidding?
He loves you!

19:52.459 --> 19:54.694
- I would never take something
that's not mine.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.862
But thank you.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.297
- Are you sure?
- Thank you so much.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.399
- I feel like
he wants to go with you.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.633
- [laughing]

20:00.667 --> 20:02.735
Well, shall we go? Okay.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.903
- Oh. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.973
Thanks, everybody.
Oh, bye, Monty.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.741
Bye, Felicia.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.443
- Oh, it's Staci, actually.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.813
- I don't give a shit.

20:13.846 --> 20:17.250
- If you can just...oh, God.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.452
All right. Come on, Monty.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.854
Don't you dare poop.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.957
Come on, gorgeous.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.827
Oh, Jesus, God!

20:27.860 --> 20:29.696
Oh, God.
