00:15.872 --> 00:17.973
(sobs)

00:17.975 --> 00:20.625
(shuddered breath)

00:24.431 --> 00:26.081
Are you okay?

00:26.083 --> 00:27.432
What?

00:27.434 --> 00:28.767
Who are you?

00:28.769 --> 00:30.185
I'm a police officer.

00:30.187 --> 00:32.771
Um, I mean, I'm off-duty,

00:32.773 --> 00:35.223
but here.

00:35.225 --> 00:36.474
Jamie Reagan.

00:36.476 --> 00:37.776
What's your name?

00:38.562 --> 00:39.811
Tina.

00:39.813 --> 00:41.313
Tina? Tina what?

00:41.315 --> 00:43.698
Look, I'm fine.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.734
The bruises on your face
say different.

00:45.736 --> 00:47.786
These are nothing. I'm just...

00:47.788 --> 00:50.655
Clumsy?

00:51.491 --> 00:53.124
Tina, listen,
if you talk to me,

00:53.126 --> 00:55.577
maybe I can help.

00:55.579 --> 00:58.296
Please.
He's watching me right now.

00:58.298 --> 01:00.465
Then point him out.

01:01.251 --> 01:02.500
I mean, he could be.

01:02.502 --> 01:04.169
I don't know, okay?

01:04.171 --> 01:05.503
What, is he your boyfriend?

01:05.504 --> 01:06.972
He's an ex-boyfriend?
What's his name?

01:06.974 --> 01:08.223
I can't tell you.

01:08.225 --> 01:10.809
If he finds out I said
even one word to a cop...

01:10.811 --> 01:13.561
Okay, that's all the more reason
we got to stop him, okay?

01:15.265 --> 01:17.232
You see that cop car over there?
He can take us

01:17.234 --> 01:18.600
right over to the 6-5 precinct.

01:18.602 --> 01:19.684
We can get you medical help,

01:19.686 --> 01:21.069
you can tell me the whole story.

01:22.439 --> 01:24.489
You'd do all of that
for a stranger?

01:25.359 --> 01:26.941
Yeah, it's my job.

01:26.943 --> 01:29.494
Besides, I don't think I could
run another ten feet.

01:29.496 --> 01:30.862
(laughs softly)

01:30.864 --> 01:33.031
I'll go flag him down.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.333
Okay?

01:35.335 --> 01:36.701
Just be a minute.

01:40.540 --> 01:41.623
(running footsteps)
MAN: I found you!

01:41.625 --> 01:44.192
(gasps)
(laughing)

01:47.180 --> 01:49.514
(indistinct conversation)

01:52.269 --> 01:53.585
(girl screams)
(gasps)

01:53.587 --> 01:55.387
Grandma.
Grandma, are you okay?

01:55.389 --> 01:56.888
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

01:56.890 --> 01:59.891
(gasps)

02:03.313 --> 02:04.896
I got a girl over here
who looks pretty beat up.

02:04.898 --> 02:06.281
Can I get her a lift
to the precinct?

02:06.283 --> 02:08.199
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, right over there.

02:08.201 --> 02:09.901
Where?

02:09.902 --> 02:11.252
Hold on.

02:11.254 --> 02:13.455
Tina?

02:26.887 --> 02:28.803
Morning, Pop.

02:28.805 --> 02:30.171
Francis.

02:30.173 --> 02:31.256
Coffee?

02:31.258 --> 02:33.758
Had mine.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.945
I can't find my bow tie
for the dinner tonight.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.764
Use mine; it's in my closet.

02:39.766 --> 02:40.932
Oh, another thing.

02:40.934 --> 02:42.400
Shoot.

02:42.402 --> 02:45.653
Are you sure they know
that I'm attending and not you?

02:45.655 --> 02:48.156
Absolutely.
Baker confirmed last night.

02:48.158 --> 02:49.774
Good, 'cause I hate that look
of disappointment

02:49.776 --> 02:51.609
when they're expecting you
and they get me.

02:51.611 --> 02:54.579
What do you mean?
What I said.

02:57.951 --> 03:00.452
Get that out of your head, Pop.

03:00.454 --> 03:03.088
Nobody's disappointed
when you show up.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.756
When I go,

03:04.758 --> 03:05.957
everybody's on their toes.

03:05.959 --> 03:07.459
When you go,

03:07.461 --> 03:09.544
everybody puts their feet up.

03:09.546 --> 03:11.646
You think?

03:11.648 --> 03:14.099
I don't think, I know.

03:14.885 --> 03:17.435
Just have fun, Pop.

03:18.271 --> 03:20.138
(chuckles)

03:20.140 --> 03:23.224
Here and here.

03:23.226 --> 03:24.943
Okay, and you'll get this
to the clerk,

03:24.945 --> 03:26.311
because I am late for court.

03:26.313 --> 03:27.645
Anything else?

03:27.647 --> 03:28.947
Nope, knock them dead.

03:28.949 --> 03:31.199
Okay, thanks.

03:32.152 --> 03:33.234
Miss Reagan, right?

03:33.236 --> 03:34.452
Yes, Tom...

03:34.454 --> 03:35.787
Yeah, Pincus,
Rutgers University.

03:35.789 --> 03:37.205
Of course, hi.

03:37.207 --> 03:38.873
This is Alicia.
This is Mr. Pincus.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.642
He interviewed Nicky last month.

03:40.644 --> 03:43.578
And was greatly impressed.
Great.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.047
I'm sure she'll have
a lot of great choices.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.883
But not Rutgers?

03:48.885 --> 03:51.753
That would be out of bounds
for me to discuss.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.471
I'm sure you understand.

03:54.591 --> 03:55.807
Nice to see you again.

03:55.809 --> 03:57.509
Tom, wait.

03:58.562 --> 04:01.729
Please, is there anything
you can say about Nicky?

04:01.731 --> 04:03.515
Let's just say

04:03.517 --> 04:05.650
the university hopes
that parents

04:05.652 --> 04:08.736
have a good handle on their
students' social media activity.

04:09.773 --> 04:11.823
Nice to meet you.

04:18.531 --> 04:21.499
(siren wailing)

04:21.500 --> 04:23.618
Female assault victim.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.203
And then some,
broken arm, broken rib,

04:25.205 --> 04:27.205
concussion,
probable internal bleeding.

04:27.207 --> 04:29.040
Doctor, this is my husband
and his partner.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.508
Hope you two can get her
to talk.

04:30.510 --> 04:32.927
Only thing she said so far
is she deserved this.

04:35.682 --> 04:36.881
I'm a detective
with the NYPD.

04:36.883 --> 04:38.600
Will you talk to us?

04:38.602 --> 04:41.236
Leave me alone.

04:41.238 --> 04:43.021
You're in good hands now, okay?
You're safe.

04:43.023 --> 04:44.722
Can you just tell me your name,
all right?

04:44.724 --> 04:45.890
Tina McDermott.

04:45.892 --> 04:46.975
Tina?

04:46.977 --> 04:50.195
Tina, tell me
who did this to you.

04:51.531 --> 04:53.364
I know you're afraid.

04:53.366 --> 04:54.616
I promise you,

04:54.618 --> 04:56.985
if you tell me who did this,
we will find him,

04:56.987 --> 04:59.404
and he will never
hurt you again.

04:59.406 --> 05:01.789
But he-he will.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.542
He'll kill me.

05:04.544 --> 05:07.795
And-and the other one
who tried to help.

05:07.797 --> 05:09.581
You spoke to the police already?

05:09.583 --> 05:12.000
That's why he did this.

05:12.002 --> 05:14.969
He has friends who'll help him
kill whoever.

05:17.507 --> 05:19.007
(machine beeping rapidly)

05:19.009 --> 05:20.391
She's coding.

05:20.393 --> 05:22.427
DOCTOR: Detective,
give us some room.

05:24.598 --> 05:26.431
WOMAN:
Need more hands here.

05:26.433 --> 05:28.349
Did I hear right?
Another cop tried to help her?

05:28.351 --> 05:30.401
Yeah, and now he's
on a hit list.

05:31.271 --> 05:33.855
We got to get a
name out of her.

05:33.857 --> 05:35.773
Clear.

05:35.775 --> 05:37.609
WOMAN:
She's unresponsive.

05:37.611 --> 05:40.161
Resuming compressions.

05:40.163 --> 05:41.329
Clear.

05:43.283 --> 05:44.708
I think I know
who the other cop is.

05:44.732 --> 05:45.334
What?

05:45.335 --> 05:47.619
And you know him even better.
DOCTOR: Clear.

05:49.873 --> 05:52.457
(flatline beeping)

05:53.877 --> 05:55.093
Clear.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.912
WOMAN:
Still no pulse.

05:57.914 --> 06:00.515

You're the last person

other than the guy who
offed her, of course.

06:37.496 --> 06:38.879
I can't believe
Tina's dead.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.163
Well, she is.

06:40.165 --> 06:41.832
Her full name's
Tina McDermott.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.384
She was so scared
her boyfriend was watching her.

06:44.386 --> 06:45.669
I guess he really was.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.170
Baez is looking
into who he is.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.805
In the meantime,
what I need from you

06:48.807 --> 06:51.225
is to tell me exactly what
happened this morning, okay?

06:51.227 --> 06:52.843
Yeah.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.678
I was running

06:54.680 --> 06:56.847
the Flatiron Plaza
about 8:35 a.m.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.600
I saw Tina sitting on a bench,
bruises on her left eye

06:59.602 --> 07:01.435
and her right arm,
and she was really spooked.

07:01.437 --> 07:02.903
Said somebody was stalking her,

07:02.905 --> 07:04.855
but she took off before
I could get her whole story.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.440
All right,
you didn't see no one else?

07:06.442 --> 07:07.574
No.

07:07.576 --> 07:08.942
But even if this guy
wasn't there,

07:08.944 --> 07:10.527
I think he was
way inside her head.

07:10.529 --> 07:11.662
Seems now he wants

07:11.664 --> 07:13.780
your head on a platter
for getting involved.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.415
Really?

07:15.417 --> 07:16.500
Yeah, really.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.201
He must have found your card
or something.

07:18.203 --> 07:19.753
Let him come find me.

07:19.755 --> 07:21.271
Jamie, I'm serious.

07:21.273 --> 07:23.457
What? Danny, perps threaten cops
all the time.

07:23.459 --> 07:25.375
Probably happens to you three,
four times a day.

07:25.377 --> 07:28.812
Which is exactly why
you should trust me on this.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.764
Look, yeah, I get it.

07:30.766 --> 07:33.133
Cops all want to play tough guys
and blow it off,

07:33.135 --> 07:35.435
and I'm probably as guilty
of doing that as anyone.

07:35.437 --> 07:37.271
But this is different;
you're my kid brother.

07:37.273 --> 07:38.655
And it's serious.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.440
Well, then I'll be

07:40.442 --> 07:42.142
extra careful, Danny,
all right?

07:42.144 --> 07:43.727
Besides, I got Janko
watching my back.

07:43.729 --> 07:44.945
Just do me a favor.

07:44.947 --> 07:46.980
Play house mouse at the precinct
a couple days,

07:46.982 --> 07:49.366
all right?
Danny, I'm on duty, all right?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.485
Look, I answered all
your questions.

07:51.487 --> 07:53.153
If you got any more,
just call me.

07:53.155 --> 07:55.372
Kid...

07:57.626 --> 07:59.660
He give you anything?
Yeah.

07:59.662 --> 08:00.662
Stubborn attitude.

08:00.663 --> 08:02.612
A Reagan? I'm shocked.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.665
It's different
with my kid brother.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.166
Well, maybe the fact
that you still call him

08:06.168 --> 08:07.584
your "kid" brother
has something to do

08:07.586 --> 08:08.835
with the stubborn attitude.

08:08.837 --> 08:10.170
Are you hear to bust my chops,

08:10.172 --> 08:11.421
or do you got something for me?

08:11.423 --> 08:13.640
I talked to our
dead girl's roommate.

08:13.642 --> 08:14.841
She didn't know Tina very well.

08:14.843 --> 08:17.010
She only moved in
a couple of months ago,

08:17.012 --> 08:19.846
but she did overhear Tina having
arguments with her boyfriend,

08:19.848 --> 08:21.098
a guy named Little G.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.933
Mm-hmm.
He works the door

08:22.935 --> 08:24.101
at a club downtown.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.686
Works at a club downtown.
Great.

08:25.688 --> 08:27.821
Then I guess
we're going out tonight.

08:31.827 --> 08:33.275
I am serious about this.

08:33.278 --> 08:35.412
You can't just put a boot
on their vehicles.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.863
Why not?
Seriously?

08:36.865 --> 08:38.332
MAN: Commissioner.
Carry on.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.448
I just said that.

08:39.451 --> 08:42.703
$300,000 in unpaid fines
calls for action.

08:42.705 --> 08:44.454
They're United Nations
diplomats.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.506
That says it all.

08:46.508 --> 08:47.841
Frank...
Commissioner,

08:47.843 --> 08:50.510
I just came from your office.

08:50.512 --> 08:52.629
And I wasn't there.

08:52.631 --> 08:53.964
Yes, right.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.432
I got a call about your son.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.633
Don't tell me.

08:56.635 --> 08:59.269
Without you at the 5-4,
Danny's taken over.

09:00.389 --> 09:01.555
Actually, Detective Reagan

09:01.557 --> 09:03.106
is the solution this time.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.641
He caught a homicide,

09:04.643 --> 09:07.661
and evidence suggests that
the as-yet-unidentified perp

09:07.663 --> 09:09.896
may be gunning
for a second victim:

09:09.898 --> 09:11.865
Officer Reagan. Jamie.

09:15.237 --> 09:17.821
Threat assessment notified?
Yes, sir.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.790
Parameters?
Because the killer claims

09:19.792 --> 09:21.575
he has, quote,
"friends that could help,"

09:21.577 --> 09:23.577
the thought is
that maybe it might be gang

09:23.579 --> 09:25.712
or drug cartel related.

09:25.714 --> 09:27.364
The officer's status?

09:27.366 --> 09:30.050
He declined
a restricted duty assignment.

09:32.304 --> 09:34.421
Any precautions
or modifications?

09:34.423 --> 09:36.256
There's an effort
to get him

09:36.258 --> 09:38.708
to give TARU access
to fortify his apartment, but...

09:38.710 --> 09:41.261
Then that's that.

09:42.347 --> 09:43.897
Sir, aren't you gonna
call Jamie in,

09:43.899 --> 09:45.849
try to convince him yourself?

09:45.851 --> 09:48.185
Would you be advising me to

09:48.187 --> 09:50.987
if the officer's name
were Tom, Dick or Harry?

09:50.989 --> 09:52.222
No, sir, but...

09:52.224 --> 09:53.690
One of my men made a decision

09:53.692 --> 09:56.526
based on his understanding
of facts on the ground.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.362
It is my job to back him,
not dissuade him.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.549
But that officer
is also your son.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.117
You're listening to me,
Sergeant,

10:04.119 --> 10:05.535
but you're not hearing me.

10:05.537 --> 10:07.254
Fix that.

10:11.376 --> 10:12.843
Garrett, what did I do wrong?

10:12.845 --> 10:14.428
Nothing.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.763
Five years in, I'm still trying
to crack the code

10:16.765 --> 10:17.931
regarding the offspring.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.132
Should I start packing again?

10:19.134 --> 10:20.600
No.

10:20.602 --> 10:22.135
I guess in about half an hour,

10:22.137 --> 10:24.471
he's gonna give Jamie a call
with a little fatherly check-in.

10:24.473 --> 10:25.856
But we just sit on our hands?

10:25.858 --> 10:27.641
Welcome to my world.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.276
Yeah.

10:29.278 --> 10:32.112
(sighs)

10:40.322 --> 10:42.072
(sighs)

10:42.074 --> 10:43.573
Tough day?

10:43.575 --> 10:45.158
Geez.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.376
Lurk much?

10:46.378 --> 10:48.011
Ran into
the guy

10:48.013 --> 10:50.297
who interviewed you for Rutgers.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.949
Small world.

10:52.951 --> 10:55.135
He was very...

10:55.137 --> 10:57.170
diplomatic.

10:58.073 --> 10:59.706
What's that mean?

10:59.708 --> 11:00.924
I gave a bad interview?

11:00.926 --> 11:01.975
No.

11:01.977 --> 11:03.844
On the contrary.

11:03.846 --> 11:05.846
Then he read what you tweeted

11:05.848 --> 11:09.483
about your teacher
at Blessed Heart, I'm guessing.

11:12.821 --> 11:14.020
Which one?

11:14.022 --> 11:16.156
Which one?

11:16.158 --> 11:18.909
Mrs. Wilson, Social Studies?

11:18.911 --> 11:21.027
The "bitch who might be

11:21.029 --> 11:23.713
"a good teacher if
she wasn't so busy

11:23.715 --> 11:25.248
"ramming her personal views

11:25.250 --> 11:26.550
down our throats all the time"?

11:26.552 --> 11:27.501
It's true!

11:27.503 --> 11:29.002
She picks on me every day.

11:30.038 --> 11:31.922
She hates anyone
even halfway related

11:31.924 --> 11:33.623
to law enforcement.
That is not the point.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.293
Then what is?
How you behave on Twitter.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.677
You think first

11:37.679 --> 11:39.262
and then you tweet.
Mom...

11:39.264 --> 11:41.748
Colleges are looking at you,
Nicky.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.433
You think they
want students

11:43.435 --> 11:45.802
who publicly flame
their teachers?

11:45.804 --> 11:47.721
(scoffs)
Like you did in high school?

11:48.557 --> 11:50.607
What?

11:50.609 --> 11:52.442
I respected my teachers.

11:52.444 --> 11:53.810
Really?

11:53.812 --> 11:55.729
Because in that
slam book of yours

11:55.731 --> 11:56.863
I found in storage,

11:56.865 --> 11:58.398
you said some pretty
mean stuff about them.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.483
That is different.

12:00.485 --> 12:01.868
How is it different?
How?

12:01.870 --> 12:03.987
Writing in a notebook
for a few friends

12:03.989 --> 12:05.322
is a lot different

12:05.324 --> 12:07.841
than tweeting on the Internet
for a few thousand.

12:07.843 --> 12:09.576
I only have 200 followers.

12:09.578 --> 12:11.928
Yeah, well, now you have
one less: Rutgers.

12:24.309 --> 12:25.759
I'm sorry.

12:27.512 --> 12:29.262
I just... I got so mad

12:29.264 --> 12:30.897
and I just started typing.

12:30.899 --> 12:34.651
This is exactly what
I warned you about.

12:41.109 --> 12:43.193
So, is this over now?

12:43.195 --> 12:45.779
Not quite.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.622
WOMAN:
Over here, Henry. Smile.

12:55.624 --> 12:57.924
MAN:
All right, smile everyone.

12:59.461 --> 13:02.596
Thank you so much for
coming tonight, Henry.

13:02.598 --> 13:05.882
Your words to our scholarship
honorees were very inspiring.

13:05.884 --> 13:09.102
Well, they seem like
a nice bunch of kids.

13:09.104 --> 13:10.971
I've just never
given a speech before

13:10.973 --> 13:13.356
and seen so many people
holding up their phones.

13:13.358 --> 13:14.858
(laughs)

13:14.860 --> 13:16.776
Well, in today's world,
that's a standing ovation.

13:16.778 --> 13:18.144
(chuckles)

13:18.146 --> 13:20.447
Now, can I count on you
for the winter fund-raiser?

13:20.449 --> 13:23.116
I'll clear my
busy schedule.

13:23.118 --> 13:24.451
(laughs)

13:24.453 --> 13:25.485
Thanks, Joan.

13:25.487 --> 13:26.653
Mm-hmm.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.076
(humming)

13:33.078 --> 13:34.411
Reagan...

13:34.413 --> 13:36.379
wet your whistle.

13:36.381 --> 13:37.580
Nah, I've had enough.

13:37.582 --> 13:40.750
Ah, come on, I paid 50 bucks

13:40.752 --> 13:41.885
to have this
suit let out.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.004
I gotta make my money back
with the open bar.

13:44.006 --> 13:46.806
Good point.

13:50.312 --> 13:51.561
So...

13:51.563 --> 13:54.464
how bad's this thing
with your grandson?

13:54.466 --> 13:55.732
How'd you hear about that?

13:55.734 --> 13:56.683
Oh, come on.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.935
A threat comes in,
word gets out.

13:58.937 --> 14:00.854
So?

14:00.856 --> 14:02.605
No comment.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.908
Since when did you not have
an opinion on something?

14:04.910 --> 14:06.326
(chuckles)

14:06.328 --> 14:08.111
Yeah.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.863
Why should I pussyfoot around

14:09.865 --> 14:12.782
when some son of a bitch
is going after my grandson?

14:12.784 --> 14:14.784
Damn straight.
Let's just put it this way:

14:14.786 --> 14:17.253
If I was still P.C.,

14:17.255 --> 14:19.372
this guy would
already be in cuffs,

14:19.374 --> 14:20.674
if not the morgue.

14:20.676 --> 14:22.258
(laughing)

14:24.046 --> 14:25.295
Back in the day,

14:25.297 --> 14:28.598
some dirtbag threatened
to murder one of my men.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.886
So I ordered every cop
in every precinct

14:32.888 --> 14:37.057
to grab their nightsticks
and hand out wood shampoos

14:37.059 --> 14:39.676
till someone
coughed up a name.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.479
An hour later, we had the creep

14:42.481 --> 14:45.315
and the cop he threatened

14:45.317 --> 14:48.485
never even knew
he was in danger.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.905
Reagan, I wish
you were still at One PP.

14:51.907 --> 14:53.990
HENRY:
You know...

14:53.992 --> 14:55.709
some days,
so do I.

14:57.579 --> 14:59.028
'Nother one?

14:59.030 --> 15:00.747
Why not?
(laughs)

15:00.749 --> 15:02.716
Nurse!

15:02.718 --> 15:04.918
(loud dance music playing)

15:06.054 --> 15:08.004
You're done, pal.
G, get him out of here.

15:08.006 --> 15:09.222
I just paid for a drink!
Get him out of here!

15:09.224 --> 15:10.306
There's your drink.

15:10.308 --> 15:12.342
DANNY:
Hey! Hey, you.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.810
Hey. Come here.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.845
Come here.
Get up against the wall.

15:15.847 --> 15:17.063
How can I help you?
Get up against the wall.

15:17.065 --> 15:18.264
Back up.
Police.

15:18.266 --> 15:19.733
DANNY:
Let me guess,

15:19.735 --> 15:21.401
Little G?

15:21.403 --> 15:24.270
Where were you today when
Tina McDermott was murdered?

15:24.272 --> 15:25.989
What?

15:25.991 --> 15:27.357
Come on,
don't act like

15:27.359 --> 15:28.525
you don't know what
the hell she's talking about.

15:28.527 --> 15:29.659
Answer the question.
I don't.

15:29.661 --> 15:30.910
I haven't seen
Tina in weeks.

15:32.447 --> 15:35.782
What... is she really dead?

15:35.784 --> 15:37.917
No, no.
Hey, hey!

15:37.919 --> 15:39.419
Hey. Come here.

15:39.421 --> 15:41.621
Come here. Settle down.

15:41.623 --> 15:43.540
Why haven't you
seen Tina in weeks?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.958
I broke up with her.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.793
I mean... not that I wanted to.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.628
But she wouldn't let me take
care of that son of a bitch.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.296
Look, I know it was him,
I know it was...

15:50.298 --> 15:51.598
I'm gonna kill him!
Okay, okay.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.466
I'm gonna kill that bastard!
Hey.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.135
Hey! Relax.

15:55.137 --> 15:56.853
(sobs)

15:56.855 --> 15:58.438
Who the hell you talking about?

15:58.440 --> 16:01.474
Tina had this ex-boyfriend,
all right?

16:01.476 --> 16:02.692
He started stalking her,

16:02.694 --> 16:04.477
and showing up
at every corner,

16:04.479 --> 16:06.663
saying-saying that if
he can't have her, no one can.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.114
I mean, the psycho even told her

16:08.116 --> 16:10.366
that... that he'd kill me
if I didn't let her go.

16:10.368 --> 16:11.601
So you did.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.236
Look, I wanted to beat his ass,

16:13.238 --> 16:17.157
but Tina wouldn't
tell me his name.

16:17.159 --> 16:18.958
You know,
and after a while of...

16:18.960 --> 16:22.328
of trying to help her, I just...

16:22.330 --> 16:23.880
I had to give up.

16:27.335 --> 16:29.502
(crying):
I can't believe she's dead.

16:30.505 --> 16:32.555
(sniffles)
Where were you today

16:32.557 --> 16:34.090
between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.?

16:34.092 --> 16:36.309
Same place I always am,
okay, the gym.

16:36.311 --> 16:37.994
Anyone confirm that for you?

16:37.996 --> 16:39.229
It's a 24-hour place.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.680
I can take you there right now.

16:40.682 --> 16:42.482
All right.

16:42.484 --> 16:43.900
Let's go tell your boss
you're gonna take a break.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.068
Come on.

16:49.524 --> 16:50.907
That's not our
guy, is it?

16:50.909 --> 16:52.859
My gut says no.

16:55.447 --> 16:56.746
JANKO:
<i>For the record?</i>

16:56.748 --> 16:59.165
This whole "being partnered
with a marked man" thing

16:59.167 --> 17:00.617
isn't really living up
to the hype.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.335
Yeah, quiet night.

17:02.337 --> 17:04.337
Are you scared?

17:04.339 --> 17:06.339
You sound like Danny.

17:06.340 --> 17:07.790
And your dad.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.592
Or do you think he just
called you out of the blue?

17:09.594 --> 17:11.294
I think everyone's overreacting.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.630
This guy stalked
and murdered a 90-pound girl,

17:13.632 --> 17:15.048
which makes him a coward
in my book.

17:15.050 --> 17:16.382
So I don't know what
I'm supposed to be

17:16.384 --> 17:18.718
afraid of.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.271
What is this,
a fender bender?

17:21.272 --> 17:23.640
Finally, some
excitement.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.892
(honks horn)

17:25.894 --> 17:27.060
(sighs)

17:27.061 --> 17:28.560
Go around!

17:28.563 --> 17:30.363
Here we go.

17:30.365 --> 17:31.731
(siren whoops)

17:33.235 --> 17:34.784
Wait.

17:34.786 --> 17:35.902
Wait, wait, Janko.

17:35.904 --> 17:37.070
It's a set-up.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.957
Ah! Ah!

17:40.959 --> 17:42.542
NKO:
Reagan!

17:43.128 --> 17:44.661
Get out!

17:44.663 --> 17:46.262
Get out of the car!

17:46.264 --> 17:49.549
Get out! Janko, get out!

17:49.551 --> 17:53.636
(both panting)

17:53.638 --> 17:54.804
Reagan!

17:54.806 --> 17:56.756
Reagan, come on.

17:57.592 --> 17:59.225
Come on, we got to move.

17:59.227 --> 18:01.394
(panting)

18:01.396 --> 18:02.729
Come on!

18:02.731 --> 18:04.564
(explosion)

18:08.236 --> 18:10.486
(grunting)

18:29.790 --> 18:30.972
(siren wailing)

18:30.974 --> 18:33.875
It was dark.

18:33.877 --> 18:35.760
You didn't see
a face, Jamie?

18:35.762 --> 18:38.246
No, the guy had
a hoodie on.

18:38.248 --> 18:39.914
Yes or no?

18:39.916 --> 18:42.517
Uh...

18:42.519 --> 18:44.185
I might have, I don't know.

18:45.105 --> 18:46.855
How's Janko?

18:46.857 --> 18:48.440
She's good-- not a scratch.

18:48.442 --> 18:50.225
At least now you'll take
this serious, right?

18:50.227 --> 18:52.894
Yeah, Renzulli's sending TARU
to my place to set it up now.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.112
Great, 'cause
that's where

18:54.114 --> 18:55.864
you're gonna be sitting
until we find this guy.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.532
Let's get to it.

18:57.534 --> 18:59.534
Hang in
there, Jamie.

18:59.536 --> 19:00.785
Hey, kid...
No,

19:00.787 --> 19:01.986
I don't know where Eddie is,

19:01.988 --> 19:03.838
so you can't ask her
to keep an eye on me.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.156
I'm gonna be fine,
Danny.

19:05.158 --> 19:07.725
I was just gonna tell you
not to eat the green Jell-O.

19:14.117 --> 19:17.919
Back in the day, some dirtbag

19:17.921 --> 19:20.805
threatened to murder
one of my men.

19:20.807 --> 19:25.477
So I ordered every cop
in every precinct

19:25.479 --> 19:27.262
to grab their nightsticks

19:27.264 --> 19:28.980
and hand out wood shampoos

19:28.982 --> 19:31.132
till somebody coughed up a name.

19:31.134 --> 19:33.685
GARRETT:
Frank, this is not that.

19:33.687 --> 19:36.020
Sir... (clears throat)

19:36.022 --> 19:38.523
I've seen it, Baker.

19:40.277 --> 19:42.994
The rest of the day. Sir.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.200
Thought that dinner
was off the record.

19:49.202 --> 19:50.418
(laughs)

19:50.420 --> 19:51.870
Is there such
a thing anymore?

19:51.872 --> 19:52.872
Wrong answer.

19:52.873 --> 19:54.506
Well, tell me what
the right one is,

19:54.508 --> 19:56.875
because my phone's been ringing
off the hook all morning.

19:56.877 --> 19:58.760
Local news,
national news,

19:58.762 --> 20:01.162
every cable outlet,
every newspaper.

20:01.164 --> 20:03.431
My only comment will be
no comment.

20:07.854 --> 20:09.938
So the current P.C.

20:09.940 --> 20:12.891
is biting his tongue
while the former P.C.

20:12.893 --> 20:14.642
runs his mouth to the world?

20:14.644 --> 20:16.277
That's what we're going with?

20:16.279 --> 20:19.197
He didn't know
he was being filmed.

20:19.199 --> 20:20.199
Doesn't matter.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.983
Well, you know how fast

20:21.985 --> 20:23.451
these things
rise up and die down.

20:23.453 --> 20:24.853
Not this
trifecta--

20:24.855 --> 20:26.070
viral video,

20:26.072 --> 20:27.405
police brutality,

20:27.407 --> 20:29.240
two generations
of P.C.s.

20:29.242 --> 20:30.625
You need to talk to Henry.

20:30.627 --> 20:31.960
Let's move on.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.711
No.
What?

20:33.713 --> 20:35.163
He needs to take accountability.

20:35.165 --> 20:37.248
Moving on.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.751
(thumps coffeepot on table)

20:50.730 --> 20:52.313
So...

20:52.315 --> 20:53.815
nothing on Tina's cell phone?
No.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.100
No threatening voice mails
or text messages

20:56.102 --> 20:58.770
and every outside call
came from a disposable.

20:58.772 --> 21:00.154
Well, Little G
did say this nutjob

21:00.156 --> 21:02.073
preferred to scare her in public.
Yeah.

21:02.075 --> 21:04.242
Stalking with a personal touch.

21:05.695 --> 21:06.744
Wait a minute.

21:06.746 --> 21:08.580
He knows Jamie

21:08.582 --> 21:10.198
from the business card.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.616
Then he would have to touch it

21:11.618 --> 21:13.918
or put his hands on it
to read the name, right?

21:13.920 --> 21:15.870
So if we get the card
from the property clerk

21:15.872 --> 21:17.255
and we run it for prints...

21:17.257 --> 21:20.425
We may be able
to I.D. our bad guy.

21:26.049 --> 21:28.266
Thank you again
for making time for us

21:28.268 --> 21:30.718
this morning, Mrs. Wilson.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.604
Always happy
to accommodate a parent

21:32.606 --> 21:34.555
we rarely see
at school functions.

21:34.557 --> 21:37.108
The curse of the
career, I'm afraid.

21:37.110 --> 21:39.160
You're a lawyer
if I recall?

21:39.162 --> 21:40.311
Deputy district attorney.

21:40.313 --> 21:41.296
That's right.

21:41.298 --> 21:43.781
The Reagans prefer
the home team

21:43.783 --> 21:46.367
when it comes to justice
in our society.

21:46.369 --> 21:48.202
Both sides need a voice.

21:48.204 --> 21:49.287
Oh, I'm only saying

21:49.289 --> 21:51.572
that it's puzzling
that for a family

21:51.574 --> 21:53.324
so committed
to respecting authority,

21:53.326 --> 21:57.045
we've had this problem
with Nicky.

22:00.250 --> 22:03.618
Mrs. Wilson, I'm sorry
for what I said about you.

22:03.620 --> 22:07.472
Sorry for the vulgarity you used
or sorry you got caught?

22:07.474 --> 22:09.057
Sorry that

22:09.059 --> 22:11.059
what I said was

22:11.061 --> 22:13.378
mean and disrespectful.

22:13.380 --> 22:15.480
So I deleted the tweet.

22:15.482 --> 22:16.981
And I promise I will never

22:16.983 --> 22:19.350
tweet anything
about school matters again.

22:19.352 --> 22:21.519
Well, it's a bit
like closing the barn door

22:21.521 --> 22:24.973
after the horse has
already escaped, but

22:24.975 --> 22:26.607
I accept your apology.

22:26.609 --> 22:27.659
(quiet laugh)

22:27.661 --> 22:29.494
Has God?

22:30.580 --> 22:33.998
You haven't been
to Confession yet.

22:35.285 --> 22:36.668
I will go later today.

22:36.670 --> 22:37.652
Like I said,

22:37.654 --> 22:40.672
thank you for making the time.

22:41.675 --> 22:44.258
We're finished?

22:44.260 --> 22:46.327
Aren't we?

22:46.329 --> 22:48.863
I thought you'd be offering
your own apology.

22:48.865 --> 22:50.631
You are responsible

22:50.633 --> 22:53.351
for teaching your daughter
to own up to her mistakes

22:53.353 --> 22:55.553
without having to
be dragged here.

22:55.555 --> 22:57.722
Right?

23:01.061 --> 23:04.562
You have a nice day, ma'am.

23:07.367 --> 23:09.701
You're not kidding.

23:21.247 --> 23:22.747
Garrett?

23:24.167 --> 23:26.751
Baker told me to
meet Frank here.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.137
But you got me.
Something wrong?

23:29.139 --> 23:30.722
What the hell were you thinking?

23:31.925 --> 23:34.308
Oh... the video.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.477
Were you drunk?

23:36.479 --> 23:38.396
That's none of your business.

23:38.398 --> 23:39.897
Actually, it is.

23:39.899 --> 23:41.899
It's been the business I've been
dealing with all morning.

23:41.901 --> 23:43.851
Including having
to drop it in the lap

23:43.853 --> 23:45.103
of the man who's
actually commissioner.

23:45.105 --> 23:47.155
I can't have an opinion
about a lowlife

23:47.157 --> 23:49.240
who's trying to
murder my grandson?

23:51.027 --> 23:52.777
Of course you can
have an opinion.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.495
If I shut up about it.

23:54.497 --> 23:58.032
'Cause I only said what every
cop in this town thinks.

23:58.034 --> 23:59.967
I know one who disagrees.

23:59.969 --> 24:03.438
Really? You always put words
in Frank's mouth?

24:03.440 --> 24:07.041
'Cause if you were my DCPI,
I'd fire your ass.

24:07.043 --> 24:09.143
And I would've
never taken the job.

24:09.145 --> 24:10.378
I'm not the bad guy!

24:10.380 --> 24:12.096
Excuse me, was someone else

24:12.098 --> 24:13.431
mouthing off on that tape?

24:13.433 --> 24:16.134
It's an illegal wiretap.

24:16.136 --> 24:19.303
Go find the guy who filmed it
and bust his balls!

24:19.305 --> 24:21.055
Henry, the world's changed.

24:21.057 --> 24:23.941
For you, me and everyone else.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.195
Try and keep up.

24:40.994 --> 24:42.877
...to a great start.
When we come back...

24:42.879 --> 24:44.796
...thousand,
you'll save hundred...

24:44.798 --> 24:45.997
(changing channels)

24:45.999 --> 24:49.133
(knocking on door,
turns off TV)

24:50.670 --> 24:52.470
Who's there?

24:52.472 --> 24:54.255
JANKO:
Eddie.

24:54.257 --> 24:56.808
(knocking)
Open up.

24:56.810 --> 24:59.010
Eddie?

25:00.513 --> 25:01.762
Hey.

25:01.764 --> 25:03.815
Hey, thanks.

25:03.817 --> 25:05.349
What are you doing here?

25:05.351 --> 25:08.269
Volunteered to cover
for Muldoon and Sanchez outside

25:08.271 --> 25:11.155
while they went
and grabbed lunch.

25:11.157 --> 25:13.074
I figured you needed some, too.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.775
Yeah, appreciate it.

25:14.777 --> 25:17.662
This is a nice place, Reagan.

25:19.032 --> 25:20.832
It could use
a woman's touch.

25:20.834 --> 25:22.316
Yeah, well, couldn't we all?

25:22.318 --> 25:24.218
Oh, you with the jokes!

25:24.220 --> 25:26.154
Grace under pressure.

25:26.156 --> 25:28.873
Nothing fazes the kid.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.292
So, did, uh, TARU

25:31.294 --> 25:32.760
set you up with
anything cool?

25:32.762 --> 25:33.961
Yeah, new locks.

25:33.963 --> 25:35.379
They, uh, gave me
this panic button

25:35.381 --> 25:36.797
wired directly
to the precinct.

25:36.799 --> 25:38.132
Sweet.

25:38.134 --> 25:40.184
Help yourself.

25:40.186 --> 25:43.104
I'm starving.

25:45.775 --> 25:48.493
You have ESPN in HD?

25:48.495 --> 25:50.695
Yeah.

25:56.486 --> 25:58.703
(saw grinding)

25:58.705 --> 26:00.288
Russell Price!

26:00.290 --> 26:01.822
Hey, you guaranteed this loan.
You back out on me now,

26:01.824 --> 26:03.491
you're gonna find out
what happens to people

26:03.493 --> 26:06.127
who betray me. You hear that?

26:06.129 --> 26:08.129
He'll call you back
in 15 to life.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.298
Who the hell are you?
A couple of people who want to talk to you.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.382
Yeah, why don't you
step over here?

26:11.384 --> 26:13.751
Get your hand off me, bitch!
Hey!

26:13.753 --> 26:15.369
(grunting)

26:15.371 --> 26:16.587
MAN: Hey, hey!

26:16.589 --> 26:17.972
How about my hands
on you, huh?

26:17.974 --> 26:19.307
MAN:
What's going on?

26:21.261 --> 26:23.978
Any of you want to take a
swing at a couple of cops?

26:25.148 --> 26:26.264
Back up!

26:26.266 --> 26:27.598
Hey, easy.

26:30.019 --> 26:31.102
This guy's got
a problem with women

26:31.104 --> 26:33.271
and a bunch of pals
whose got his back.

26:33.273 --> 26:34.989
I'd say we got
the right guy.

26:34.991 --> 26:36.607
So now the police
are hassling me?

26:36.609 --> 26:38.276
Just like the Taxi Commission

26:38.278 --> 26:39.944
and everyone else at City Hall?
Shut up.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.412
This is about
your fingerprint we found

26:41.414 --> 26:43.581
on a card of a cop
you tried to kill.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.449
Right after you killed
Tina McDermott.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.864
You cannot believe
I killed Tina.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.165
DANNY:
That's the easy part.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.868
The hard part's figuring
out why she'd pick

27:01.870 --> 27:04.004
a schmuck like you
in the first place.

27:04.006 --> 27:05.305
I'm an entrepreneur.

27:05.307 --> 27:07.958
Your car service
start-up thing?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.442
Yeah. GothamGo.

27:09.444 --> 27:10.961
Which I'm gonna
make happen except

27:10.963 --> 27:13.096
everybody in this stupid city's
trying to stop me.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.548
So, you're persistent?

27:14.550 --> 27:16.883
Right.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.184
Persistent like
how you stalked Tina.

27:18.186 --> 27:19.519
Tried to kill a cop.

27:19.521 --> 27:22.055
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.858
Really? It's pretty
obvious how you did it.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.643
You had one of your drivers tail

27:26.645 --> 27:28.194
his patrol car last night.

27:28.196 --> 27:29.896
And then you had
a couple more block

27:29.898 --> 27:31.181
his path with some fake argument

27:31.183 --> 27:33.066
so you could
throw the firebomb.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.935
Nah, I was at work
until midnight.

27:34.937 --> 27:36.286
You can ask my employees.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.622
Yeah, they'll alibi for you.
You're their boss.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.740
Yeah, and of course you're
gonna try to railroad somebody

27:40.742 --> 27:42.175
'cause you're the cop's brother.

27:42.177 --> 27:43.577
Yeah.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.245
I heard her call you Reagan.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.547
Same name that's on that card.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.217
So, you admit you saw it.

27:51.219 --> 27:53.553
Yeah, Tina showed
it to me. So what?

27:53.555 --> 27:56.423
"So what?" So you beat her
to death-- that's "so what."

27:56.425 --> 27:58.508
No. I loved Tina.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.594
Hmm.
And she loved me.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.896
BAEZ: And even with all of
that love floating around,

28:02.898 --> 28:04.364
she ended up trading in

28:04.366 --> 28:07.434
her entrepreneur
for that meathead Little G, huh?

28:08.937 --> 28:11.237
She was gonna come back to me.

28:11.239 --> 28:13.106
No, she wasn't.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.158
She blew you off, didn't she?

28:15.160 --> 28:17.777
Yeah. So you roughed her
up a little bit, huh?

28:17.779 --> 28:20.280
That's when you
got really pissed

28:20.282 --> 28:22.449
because she talked
to a cop about you.

28:24.252 --> 28:26.336
Then you gave her what
she deserved, didn't you?

28:26.338 --> 28:28.588
What do you want me to say, huh?

28:29.675 --> 28:31.958
You want me to tell you
getting dumped didn't hurt?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.628
Let me tell you something.

28:34.630 --> 28:38.114
People who care about people
get hurt the most.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.716
Right.
That doesn't mean

28:39.718 --> 28:42.052
I killed Tina.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.304
Or your stupid cop brother

28:44.306 --> 28:46.106
who stuck his nose
where it didn't belong.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.025
(laughing)

28:49.027 --> 28:51.361
Keep smiling, tough guy.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.146
BAEZ:
Remember not

28:53.148 --> 28:56.032
to lose it like that
in front of the jury.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.736
I'm not going on trial
for anything.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.121
DANNY: Sure you are.
You assaulted my partner.

29:01.123 --> 29:02.956
And that's just for starters.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.709
Well, then I want
my lawyer. Now.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.211
That's the smartest thing
you said all day.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.247
MRS. WILSON:
<i>...which is why educators</i>

29:11.249 --> 29:14.300
like Dewey thought
FDR's aims were critical

29:14.302 --> 29:17.303
in furthering progressivism
in the 1930s.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.174
Okay, I want to put
a pin in the New Deal,

29:21.176 --> 29:24.094
and talk about something
that's influencing society

29:24.096 --> 29:25.679
right now.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.347
Social media.

29:27.349 --> 29:31.351
Finally, something
that we care about.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.503
That's very funny, Steven.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.523
But the rise of Facebook,

29:36.525 --> 29:38.191
Twitter, Instagram

29:38.193 --> 29:40.493
and YouTube affects every aspect

29:40.495 --> 29:43.413
of our culture in ways
unheard of

29:43.415 --> 29:44.698
even ten years ago.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.366
But that's a good thing, right?

29:46.368 --> 29:49.119
I mean,
now everyone has a voice.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.453
It can be.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.005
It can also be a bad thing

29:52.007 --> 29:54.207
when certain
irresponsible voices

29:54.209 --> 29:56.760
use social media to lie

29:56.762 --> 29:59.012
or hurt.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.214
Who can given example?

30:01.216 --> 30:04.134
How about Miss Reagan?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.052
Why are you calling on me?

30:06.054 --> 30:08.555
Oh, you have
first hand experience.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.941
But... I apologized to you.

30:11.943 --> 30:14.894
Well, has your great-grandfather
apologized to anyone yet?

30:19.367 --> 30:21.117
I'm sorry. What for?

30:21.119 --> 30:23.903
For saying how much he would
like a police state

30:23.905 --> 30:27.457
where innocent people can be
rounded up and brutalized.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.510
That was...

30:30.512 --> 30:32.378
taken out of context.

30:32.380 --> 30:34.414
Well, why'd he even say it?

30:34.416 --> 30:36.750
Well, because obviously
he believes it.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.201
This is so unfair!

30:38.203 --> 30:40.837
Well, now,
thanks to social media,

30:40.839 --> 30:44.340
everyone knows how people
in power really think.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.559
(school bell rings)

30:48.597 --> 30:51.431
(indistinct chatter)

30:51.433 --> 30:53.933
I can't believe
she just did that to you.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.102
Are you gonna tweet
about her again?

30:56.104 --> 30:58.271
No, not her.

31:06.414 --> 31:09.699
All right, take your time,
both of yous.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.285
Tell me if any
of these guys looks like

31:12.287 --> 31:14.504
the one who threw
the Molotov cocktail.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.430
I guess it was too dark.

31:24.432 --> 31:26.466
Yeah, I-I can't
tell either.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.219
Sorry.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.804
Okay.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.305
Move them out.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.474
Come on.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.311
We tanked, huh?

31:38.313 --> 31:39.696
We'll nail him
another way.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.314
Partner's already
working on something.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.866
Just wish there was
something I could do.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.901
There is something you
could do-- you can go home,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.569
and you can stay there
and listen to me, okay?

31:46.571 --> 31:47.821
What the hell
are you doing?

31:47.823 --> 31:49.205
You're supposed to take
them out the other way.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.657
Workers got it
blocked off.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.075
Then put him back
in the lineup room!

31:52.077 --> 31:53.960
You don't walk
them out this way!

31:53.962 --> 31:54.994
I'm sorry, Danny.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.663
Yo, you heard
the man, let's go!

31:58.667 --> 31:59.916
Why is that guy
eyeballing me?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.885
What?

32:01.887 --> 32:04.170
Think the guy who tried
to kill me just I.D.'d himself.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.638
Hey, wait, wait--
bring him back.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.756
Were you
eyeballing me, buddy?

32:06.758 --> 32:07.924
You got something to say?
Whoa, whoa, stop.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.475
Was it you?
Hey!

32:09.477 --> 32:12.011
You kill your girlfriend? Do you
want to kill cops now, too?

32:12.013 --> 32:13.563
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.

32:13.565 --> 32:14.647
JANKO:
Hey, you listen to me.

32:14.649 --> 32:16.566
You want a piece of my partner,

32:16.568 --> 32:18.351
you got to go through me first.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.570
DANNY: Come on.
JANKO: ...kill you.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.755
Come on!

32:22.757 --> 32:24.073
Think that's the guy.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.275
Yeah, well, it's
too late now.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.943
You didn't I.D.
him in the room.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.695
And you-- you don't jump
the leash in my squad.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.080
Go!

32:31.416 --> 32:32.448
Go.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.284
I take it the lineup
didn't go so well?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.785
It went terrible,
what do you got?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.370
Well, maybe the nail in Price's coffin.
What?

32:37.372 --> 32:38.621
The lab isolated
a partial print

32:38.623 --> 32:40.506
from a shard of glass
in the Molotov cocktail.

32:40.508 --> 32:42.375
Great, if we can tie
this print to Price,

32:42.377 --> 32:43.793
we'll get that
son of a bitch.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.211
Only if
your sister agrees.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.097
She better agree, he's
trying to kill our brother.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.386
Something smells good.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.555
Minestrone.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.474
I'd offer you some,

32:58.476 --> 33:01.728
but I know I'd have to check
with your DCPI first.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.731
I'm not following.

33:06.868 --> 33:08.851
Garrett and I had a chat today.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.738
Did you?

33:11.740 --> 33:14.240
More like an ambush, actually.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.409
Gave me an earful, too.

33:18.964 --> 33:22.782
Well, he wasn't speaking for me.

33:22.784 --> 33:26.085
So, you're fine with what I said
on the videotape?

33:26.087 --> 33:28.087
No.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.423
You were out of line, Pop.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.625
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

33:34.863 --> 33:38.431
I can't do the things
you used to do.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.234
Nor do I want to.

33:41.236 --> 33:44.654
Jamie would be safe by now
if you could.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.156
That's unknowable.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.158
At least I would've
got the message out--

33:49.160 --> 33:52.078
you screw with a cop,
you pay a price.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.247
Even if you have to tune up
some innocent people

33:54.249 --> 33:55.782
while you're at it?

33:57.953 --> 34:01.988
All that mattered was
that my men were safe.

34:01.990 --> 34:05.291
Even like the guy that I talked
about on the videotape.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.911
He had no idea that
he had almost been killed.

34:08.913 --> 34:11.130
You didn't want his thanks.

34:12.132 --> 34:15.301
I knew you'd be grateful.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.859
(sighs)

34:27.532 --> 34:30.099
JUDGE:
You follow football, Ms. Reagan?

34:30.101 --> 34:32.735
Lifelong Jets fan.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.288
So that's where you learned to
throw a Hail Mary like this one.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.290
Murder in the
second degree,

34:37.292 --> 34:39.292
attempted murder of
a police officer,

34:39.293 --> 34:41.293
assault on a police officer?

34:41.295 --> 34:43.129
Your Honor, we
will prove

34:43.130 --> 34:45.380
that Mr. Price killed
his former girlfriend,

34:45.382 --> 34:48.668
attempted to kill an officer
who went out of his way to help,

34:48.670 --> 34:51.587
and violently shoved
the investigating detective.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.723
Then I must have
the wrong document,

34:53.725 --> 34:55.341
because the facts
listed here are

34:55.342 --> 34:57.477
circumstantial and unconvincing.

34:57.479 --> 35:00.430
His fingerprint was on a piece
of the Molotov cocktail...

35:00.432 --> 35:03.599
Which proves he held that bottle
at some time in the past.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.985
Doesn't implicate him
in its assembly,

35:05.987 --> 35:07.353
or put him at the scene.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.855
Judge, I am innocent.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.140
Th-This whole family is trying
to railroad me...

35:11.142 --> 35:13.159
Mr. Price, you can shut up now.

35:13.161 --> 35:14.527
Your Honor...

35:14.529 --> 35:16.662
But he does have a point,
because it doesn't help

35:16.664 --> 35:17.864
to have your loved ones blabbing

35:17.866 --> 35:19.449
about this case
on a daily basis.

35:19.451 --> 35:23.453
My grandfather's opinion should
not influence this court.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.705
And your daughter tweeting
about what he said?

35:27.509 --> 35:30.176
My daughter's opinion should not
influence this court.

35:30.178 --> 35:33.696
The online waters are already
muddied, Ms. Reagan.

35:36.051 --> 35:40.186
If I were you, I'd recuse myself
and tell the ADA who takes over

35:40.188 --> 35:42.889
to build a better case
before coming back.

35:43.758 --> 35:44.891
(gavel slams)

35:44.893 --> 35:48.061
Mr. Price, you are free to go.

36:15.639 --> 36:18.023
DANNY: So, what'd you
do to this salmon?

36:18.906 --> 36:20.856
LINDA:
What? You don't like it?

36:20.858 --> 36:23.325
Well, I usually don't like
it, but now I do like it.

36:23.327 --> 36:25.243
A lot of lemon and salt,
a little bit of dill.

36:25.245 --> 36:27.279
DANNY:
Probably should remember that.

36:27.281 --> 36:28.747
LINDA: Of course I'm
gonna remember that.

36:28.749 --> 36:30.198
Good.
It's my recipe.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.366
Really tasty.

36:31.368 --> 36:32.751
Thank you.
You're welcome.

36:32.753 --> 36:34.670
Check mine for bones?

36:34.672 --> 36:37.172
No. Why?

36:37.174 --> 36:38.540
'Cause someone should
check mine for bones,

36:38.542 --> 36:39.841
'cause I could
choke on one.

36:39.843 --> 36:41.960
'Cause apparently
I can't look out for myself.

36:41.962 --> 36:43.128
Nobody thinks that.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.346
Well, except Danny.

36:44.348 --> 36:45.847
Yeah, well, maybe
I wouldn't think it

36:45.849 --> 36:46.915
if you weren't so pigheaded.

36:46.917 --> 36:48.483
Afraid I'll steal your crown?

36:48.485 --> 36:50.919
You were the one that was
almost roasted on a spit.

36:50.921 --> 36:53.789
At least you got family
on your case.

36:53.791 --> 36:55.991
I got a second-stringer,

36:55.993 --> 36:58.026
calling me senile.

36:58.028 --> 37:00.729
Nobody called you that.

37:00.731 --> 37:01.813
Okay, "dinosaur."

37:01.815 --> 37:03.565
Oh, cut it out.
You cut it out.

37:03.567 --> 37:05.867
We do have something
in common here, Pop.

37:05.869 --> 37:07.786
We do?
Yeah.

37:07.788 --> 37:09.154
Our obituaries are gonna
start the same way...

37:09.156 --> 37:10.322
Whoa, Dad!

37:10.324 --> 37:12.958
"Former New York City
Police Commissioner."

37:12.960 --> 37:14.743
So?
So?!

37:14.745 --> 37:17.496
For better or worse,
it defines us.

37:17.498 --> 37:20.582
So, respect the office, even
if you're not in it anymore.

37:20.584 --> 37:21.500
I do.

37:21.502 --> 37:23.418
Yes, he does.
Thank you.

37:23.420 --> 37:26.638
Not every issue begs
your opinion, Nicky.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.006
Okay, Mom.

37:28.008 --> 37:29.091
What does that mean?

37:29.093 --> 37:30.592
Yeah, why is she in trouble?

37:30.594 --> 37:35.147
Let's just say she takes
after her great-grandfather

37:35.149 --> 37:37.149
in the shooting-off-at-the-mouth
department.

37:37.151 --> 37:40.352
Yeah, and he has
to watch what he says

37:40.354 --> 37:43.488
because his opinion
still carries weight.

37:43.490 --> 37:46.491
I still think that some of
the old ways are the best ways.

37:46.493 --> 37:48.193
"The old ways are
the best ways"?

37:48.195 --> 37:50.412
That's like-- could Tyson beat
Ali in his prime?

37:50.414 --> 37:51.997
It's a non-starter.

37:51.999 --> 37:53.448
Anything else, Francis?

37:53.450 --> 37:55.033
Yes, one more thing.

37:55.035 --> 37:57.202
I love you, Pop.

38:07.715 --> 38:09.881
I do, I love you.

38:12.770 --> 38:14.720
Ah, cut it out.

38:29.153 --> 38:30.202
Good morning.

38:30.204 --> 38:31.153
Morning.

38:31.155 --> 38:32.120
You look like crap.

38:32.122 --> 38:33.739
Thanks,
I was up all night,

38:33.741 --> 38:35.240
trying to nail
a piece of crap.

38:35.242 --> 38:36.575
Yeah, me, too.
You get anything?

38:36.577 --> 38:38.243
I ran the names
of his drivers.

38:38.245 --> 38:40.328
Bunch of ex-cons,
no surprise there.

38:40.330 --> 38:42.214
Maybe we're lucky,
and one of them will flip.

38:42.216 --> 38:43.582
I combed
Price's Facebook.

38:43.584 --> 38:46.752
I found a classmate who said
he terrorized a girl in college.

38:46.754 --> 38:48.170
I'm gonna track down
her phone number.

38:48.172 --> 38:49.805
Great.

38:49.807 --> 38:52.841
You know, maybe we ought to
stalk the stalker a little bit.

38:52.843 --> 38:54.559
N-Nothing
illegal, just...

38:54.561 --> 38:55.677
Enough to let
Price know

38:55.679 --> 38:57.562
we got eyes on him
wherever he goes?

38:57.564 --> 38:58.597
Exactly.

38:58.599 --> 39:00.398
I think I know who
should be the first one

39:00.400 --> 39:01.767
out in front
of his place.

39:01.769 --> 39:04.152
Hey, how far away are you?
Roll call's in, like, a minute.

39:04.154 --> 39:06.104
Sorry, I'm dropping off
a gown at Pasolini's

39:06.106 --> 39:07.355
to be dry-cleaned.

39:07.357 --> 39:08.857
Gown?

39:08.859 --> 39:09.941
What'd you do, steal it?

39:09.943 --> 39:11.943
No, I didn't steal it.

39:11.945 --> 39:14.196
I have nice clothes, you know.

39:14.198 --> 39:15.864
And an active social life.

39:15.866 --> 39:17.365
You should try both some time.

39:17.367 --> 39:18.617
You...

39:19.703 --> 39:20.952
Eddie, you there?

39:20.954 --> 39:23.038
(dial tone sounds)
Eddie?

39:23.040 --> 39:24.339
(cell phone buzzes)

39:24.341 --> 39:25.791
Hey, Danny. What's up?

39:25.793 --> 39:27.592
Listen, we're gonna put
the screws to Price.

39:27.594 --> 39:28.627
You want in?

39:28.629 --> 39:30.428
Yeah, just as soon
as Eddie gets here.

39:30.430 --> 39:31.513
When's that gonna be?

39:31.515 --> 39:33.465
I was just asking her,
but the line went dead.

39:33.467 --> 39:34.467
Let me call her back.

39:34.468 --> 39:35.917
What do you mean,
the line went dead?

39:35.919 --> 39:37.018
I don't know.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.970
It made a weird sound,
then the call dropped.

39:40.307 --> 39:42.774
"People who care about other
people get hurt the most."

39:42.776 --> 39:43.975
What?

39:43.977 --> 39:45.360
I-It's what Price said to us.

39:45.362 --> 39:48.029
And then we came out of the
lineup, and Eddie went crazy

39:48.031 --> 39:49.815
and played mama bear
trying to protect you.

39:49.817 --> 39:50.982
You don't think
he went after her?

39:50.984 --> 39:52.567
I don't know,
but we better check.

39:52.569 --> 39:54.319
All right, she's outside
Pasolini's in the East Village.

39:54.321 --> 39:55.321
I'll meet you there.

39:55.322 --> 39:56.738
No. No, no, no.
He won't go there.

39:56.740 --> 39:57.989
It's got to be
somewhere private.

39:57.991 --> 39:59.825
He's got a, a garage
on Ninth Street, all right?

39:59.827 --> 40:01.710
Go there now.

40:06.166 --> 40:09.034
(muffled shouting)

40:09.036 --> 40:10.669
Shut up already.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.839
(laughing)

40:13.841 --> 40:16.024
That feel good?

40:16.026 --> 40:17.843
Hey, I'm almost there.

40:17.845 --> 40:19.594
Get that door open-- the
minute I pull inside,

40:19.596 --> 40:20.729
you shut it behind me.

40:20.731 --> 40:22.314
Make sure
the sign says "closed."

40:22.316 --> 40:23.398
Will do.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.151
It's almost over.

40:29.306 --> 40:31.573
Just a little bit farther.

40:54.214 --> 40:56.264
Let me see your
hands! Get 'em up!

40:58.452 --> 41:01.353
(grunts, coughs)

41:01.355 --> 41:02.604
JAMIE:
I got her!

41:02.606 --> 41:04.472
Jamie, don't move her,
I'll call a bus.

41:04.474 --> 41:06.608
(muffled talking)
Hey.

41:07.527 --> 41:09.110
(muffled talking)

41:10.781 --> 41:12.781
You got the right
to remain silent...

41:12.783 --> 41:14.032
(moans)

41:14.034 --> 41:15.183
You okay?

41:15.185 --> 41:16.234
Yeah.

41:16.236 --> 41:17.452
I'm okay.

41:17.454 --> 41:18.403
I'm a little bumpy.

41:18.405 --> 41:19.621
Okay.

41:21.124 --> 41:23.491
All right, just sit tight.
Oh, no.

41:23.493 --> 41:25.076
Don't move, just sit tight
No, I got to get out.

41:25.078 --> 41:26.598
until we get somebody
to check you out!

41:28.465 --> 41:30.715
Okay, all right.

41:30.717 --> 41:32.000
(grunts):
All right, sit down.

41:32.002 --> 41:33.585
Okay.
Okay.

41:33.587 --> 41:35.754
Okay, you all right?

41:42.012 --> 41:43.762
Two need any
help over there?

41:43.764 --> 41:45.580
No, we're all good.

41:45.582 --> 41:46.765
I think they're good.

41:46.767 --> 41:48.149
I'd say so.

41:54.324 --> 41:56.942
(distant siren wailing)
