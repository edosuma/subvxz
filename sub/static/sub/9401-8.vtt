i wrote "marry me"
in the sand, and then
i didn't tell you

because you said
you were leaving.

all right, haley,
i just wanted

to spend this weekend
with my son and my friends.

01:52.966 --> 01:54.267

this guy.

he's going.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.799
you're going.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.699
an entire weekend
in the woods --

01:58.766 --> 02:01.100
you realize i know nothing
about camping?

02:01.166 --> 02:03.333
what does this guy even know
about camping?

02:03.399 --> 02:05.267
he makes movies --

have always been girls.

than all the women you've had
in your pool in real life.

03:31.799 --> 03:34.000

with your dead wife...

03:34.066 --> 03:37.033

not so healthy.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.000
man, when i said
guys' weekend,

03:56.066 --> 03:59.066
i pictured us by the pool
at the bellagio,

03:59.133 --> 04:01.432
room and drinks comped
all 'cause we're rolling
with nathan scott.

04:01.499 --> 04:03.300
yeah, that's exactly
what i wanted --

04:03.367 --> 04:05.166
a weekend
in some casino sports book --

04:05.233 --> 04:07.532
50 tvs, 50 stations,
none of which will hire me.

04:07.599 --> 04:09.333
yeah,
but the damn woods,

04:09.399 --> 04:12.466
with hungry animals
and dudes with hockey masks?

04:12.532 --> 04:14.633
come on, man. camping's a great
way to forget your life.

04:14.699 --> 04:15.933
no tv, no internet,
no cellphones.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.466

no way to call for help.

it'll be all right.

hi, coach skills.

aw, chuck.

not the first day of school.

well, did you remember
to bring

04:39.866 --> 04:41.466
a little thermos
with the sippy cup?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.300
i got it covered.

04:46.532 --> 04:49.866
geez, eddie bauer!
did you buy the whole catalog?

04:49.933 --> 04:53.100

be prepared.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.833
i think.

first rule of camping --
travel light.

see them again?

05:22.133 --> 05:23.799
oh, i wouldn't worry.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.399
julian has enough equipment
to survive in the woods
for seven years.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.466
well, i hope you're ready
for girls' night,

05:29.532 --> 05:32.599
'cause quinn
made brownies.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.200
brownies!

05:34.267 --> 05:36.300
mmm.
they smell incredible.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.466
they should.
they're taylor's recipe.

05:38.532 --> 05:42.100
oh, sweet.
i love taylor's brownies.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.499
when hales was
in high school,

05:45.566 --> 05:47.566
she used get all stressed
about grades and tests,

05:47.633 --> 05:49.333
and we would always make
special brownies.

05:49.399 --> 05:50.966
special brownies?

05:51.033 --> 05:53.166
yeah, you know,
the usual --

05:53.233 --> 05:56.300
eggs, milk, brownie mix...
a little weed.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.066
does she know that?

05:58.133 --> 05:59.954
no.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.966
looks like the boys
aren't the only ones

06:03.033 --> 06:04.699
going on a trip tonight.

06:35.433 --> 06:38.333
who wants to get their
"go get me a beer" badge?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.733
i do!i do!

06:39.799 --> 06:41.166
nice.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.200
so, this is the same tent
the japanese climbers took

06:46.266 --> 06:48.467
to the top
of mt. everest.

06:48.532 --> 06:50.599
well, then you should
be good here,

06:50.666 --> 06:52.000
100 feet above sea level.

06:52.066 --> 06:55.367
if only the instructions
weren't also in japanese.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.033
well, i think
that looks pretty good.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.966
so, would you call that
a two-man tent?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.799
you might want to slow down
a little.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.408
That was the thing about
Taylor's brownies.

07:19.408 --> 07:20.833
the more i eat,
the hungrier i get.

07:20.866 --> 07:20.899
yeah, there's
a reason for that.

07:22.766 --> 07:27.066
it's girls' night, right --
all about spilling secrets?

07:29.632 --> 07:32.367
oh, no.
what'd you guys do?

07:32.433 --> 07:35.467
okay, taylor's recipe
calls for an eighth

07:35.532 --> 07:37.000
of granddaddy purple.

07:37.066 --> 07:38.733
what is that, some kind
of breakfast cereal?

07:40.499 --> 07:42.733
not exactly.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.400
pot?!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.200
i have to go throw up.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.433
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:51.499 --> 07:53.467
oh, relax, haley-bob.
you're about to, anyway.

07:53.532 --> 07:54.833
i do not believe,
all those years,

07:54.899 --> 07:56.166
you and tay were
getting me high.

07:56.233 --> 07:59.632
yeah, who knew tutor girl
was actually stoner girl?

07:59.699 --> 08:03.899
we never gave you the
full-strength recipe until now.

08:03.966 --> 08:05.899
i can't do this.
i have a child!

08:05.966 --> 08:07.699
who is away
for the weekend.

08:07.766 --> 08:10.632
you have had
a rough couple of months.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.100
it is perfectly acceptable
to mellow out a little.

08:15.499 --> 08:17.400
i'm so getting you back
for this.

08:17.467 --> 08:20.033
oh, come tomorrow,
you'll be thanking me.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.233
well, maybe i've built up
an immunity to these brownies.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.266
i mean, i've had two already,
and i don't feel anything.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.698
now, when they say they
represent the lollipop guild,

08:34.765 --> 08:36.366
do you think
that's a trade union?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.066
and if it is,
why did they unionize?

08:38.133 --> 08:39.532
did they need
shorter hours

08:39.599 --> 08:41.332
or longer sticks
or different flavors?

08:41.400 --> 08:43.799
look at their little suits.
they really crack me up.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.799
wow.
that didn't take very long.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.833
brooke, are you okay?

08:51.233 --> 08:53.467
will you please tell
that munchkin

08:53.532 --> 08:56.033
to stop looking at me?

08:57.733 --> 09:00.200
great. she gets chatty,
and you get paranoid.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.866
a classic
overcorrection.

09:20.566 --> 09:25.933
just give me something
simple, elegant, beautiful.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.733
you just described
everything i love about you.

09:30.799 --> 09:34.100
i thought you didn't believe
in love.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.699
isn't that what you told
that girl kylie?

09:37.766 --> 09:40.033
i meant...

09:40.100 --> 09:42.866
i could never love anyone
as much as i loved you.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.799
except for quinn.

09:44.866 --> 09:47.966
it's not like that
with quinn.

09:48.033 --> 09:50.566
i could always tell
when you were lying.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.733
the ratings are in.

09:57.799 --> 10:00.966
last week's show with renee
was our highest ever.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.066
i'm glad.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.899
we have momentum.

10:03.966 --> 10:05.632
we need something big
for sweeps,

10:05.699 --> 10:07.200
and then dr. phil
can suck it.

10:07.266 --> 10:09.933
well, maybe we can get lucas
to do a guest spot.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.966
it's not like
he's doing anything.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.766
hey, lena, beat it.
he's got enough eyeliner.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.866
okay.
what's going on?

10:19.933 --> 10:21.766
does this have anything
to do with the fact

10:21.833 --> 10:23.632
that nathan never called
to say thank you?

10:23.699 --> 10:26.899
of course not.
i never expected that.

10:26.966 --> 10:29.833
good, because we both know
that's not gonna happen.

10:29.899 --> 10:32.599
now get your head
in the game.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.300
we have an empire
to build.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.599
alex isn't that bad
once you get to know her.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.666
i'm just saying
i've known brooke a long time.

10:47.733 --> 10:50.233
i saw how hard it was for her
to get over a broken heart.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.300
well, nobody's gonna break
brooke's heart.

10:53.367 --> 10:57.100
well, good, 'cause if you do,
you'll answer to me.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.833
yeah, and i seen him naked.
he been working out.

11:00.899 --> 11:03.000
hanging with the guys
rules.

11:03.066 --> 11:04.367
so, how you doing,
chuck?

11:04.433 --> 11:06.766
my mom says
you can't marry miss lauren

11:06.833 --> 11:09.033
'cause you don't make
enough money.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.766
ah, well,
guess who just lost

11:10.833 --> 11:13.566
their "keep their
damn mouth shut" badge.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.866
so, over the last
few months,

11:14.933 --> 11:16.400
with everything
that's been going on,

11:16.467 --> 11:17.799
maybe you
were kind of scared?

11:17.866 --> 11:18.966
jamie:
not really.

11:19.033 --> 11:22.133
i knew grandpa dan
would save us again.

11:23.966 --> 11:26.733
so, can we
forgive him now?

11:29.632 --> 11:32.166
last week i helped
a confused young woman

11:32.233 --> 11:36.300
free herself from her tangled
web of lies and deceit.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.433
but tonight is about you.

11:43.499 --> 11:46.632
so tonight i ask you
to turn your gaze inward

11:46.699 --> 11:51.367
and confess the truth
inside yourself...

11:51.433 --> 11:54.300
to turn your gaze inward...

11:57.599 --> 12:00.333
...and confess.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.400
and confess --

12:12.467 --> 12:14.367
confess the tru--

12:20.200 --> 12:23.266
we should've saved that
for sweeps.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.533
that was awesome!

12:39.600 --> 12:41.333
one bravery badge
coming right up.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.233
whoa.

12:44.299 --> 12:45.767
it's your turn,
j. luke!

12:48.700 --> 12:50.500
it's so far down.

12:50.566 --> 12:53.066
this was my favorite part
of camping when i was your age.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.066
all right, jimmy-jam.
see what you got.

12:59.566 --> 13:01.767
i can't do it.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.966
[ chuckles ]
what are you talking about?

13:04.032 --> 13:07.166
it's -- it's too high.
i'm going back down the trail.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.433
i better go with julian.

13:10.466 --> 13:10.500
jamie, we've been talking
about this for weeks, man.

13:15.266 --> 13:17.433
but he might get lost.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.066
that's true.
i am directionally challenged.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.566
okay. well, i guess i'll see
you guys at the bottom, then.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.733
whew.
thanks, man.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.266
no problem.

13:31.966 --> 13:33.333
here.

13:36.666 --> 13:38.500
you're a genius,
you know that?

13:38.566 --> 13:39.966
i mean, who could miss
a single episode

13:40.032 --> 13:43.199
when dan scott could keel over
and die at any minute?

13:43.266 --> 13:46.466
i saw something
out there, rachel,

13:46.533 --> 13:47.999
in the audience.

13:50.666 --> 13:54.066
a boy --
he was bleeding.

13:57.032 --> 13:59.833
felt like my heart was
gonna burst out of my chest.

13:59.899 --> 14:01.932
you're crazy.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.500
your heart's fine.

14:06.433 --> 14:09.032
without a new heart,
you're gonna die.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.099
maybe i want to die.

14:14.266 --> 14:16.133
lon called
from putnam and pratt.

14:16.199 --> 14:18.767
he read the first three chapters
of the book.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.899
he says it's gonna be
a bestseller.

14:20.966 --> 14:25.366
think of all the good we'll do,
all the people we'll help.

14:25.433 --> 14:26.899
all the money we'll make?

14:26.966 --> 14:28.999
that too.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.800
how much is this heart
costing us?

14:33.867 --> 14:35.032
$5,000.

14:35.099 --> 14:37.566
that's very reasonable.

14:37.633 --> 14:38.767
it's a fortune
to these people.

14:40.633 --> 14:43.333
now get some sleep.

14:44.733 --> 14:47.433
tomorrow you're gonna be
a new man.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.600
sara, did you feel
any pain...

15:04.666 --> 15:07.466
when you died,
in that moment?

15:07.533 --> 15:09.433
no.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.099
well, i did.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.800
and i do, every day.
and it's not fair.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.833
life isn't fair, clay.

15:18.899 --> 15:24.666
but you being miserable
is never gonna change that.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.867
these leftovers
are incredible.

15:36.932 --> 15:38.533
i am such a good cook.

15:43.299 --> 15:45.932
what's going on with you
and the hot agent?

15:45.999 --> 15:47.199
clay?

15:48.999 --> 15:53.308
who are we talking about?
nathan's agent, clay.

15:53.999 --> 15:55.533
right.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.400
is something going on
with the two of you?

15:57.466 --> 16:01.199
no, but it's better
that way.

16:01.266 --> 16:04.233
my psychic told me to avoid
emotional entanglements.

16:04.299 --> 16:05.633
you have a psychic?

16:05.700 --> 16:08.066
she's not really mine.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.600
her name's zelda.

16:09.666 --> 16:12.066
oh, my god.
she does house calls.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.566
oh, my god.
we are totally calling her.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.366
no.
no, no. no.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.500
please, no creepy psychic --
i can't handle it right now.

16:19.566 --> 16:22.666
see if she can bring us
a pizza.

16:28.366 --> 16:29.932
we did this
in a movie i just produced.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.466
we just need one spark.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.500
all right, spielberg.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.299
why don't you produce us
some marshmallows?

16:45.266 --> 16:48.099
so, the girl say
she thinks she heard a noise

16:48.166 --> 16:49.999
scratching
on the car door, right?

16:50.066 --> 16:51.500
so she freak out.

16:51.566 --> 16:54.366
she tell the dude,
"take me home now."

16:54.433 --> 16:56.899
so of course
he get all mad

16:56.966 --> 16:59.333
because he know he's
not getting no action
tonight, right?

16:59.400 --> 17:00.899
so he drive the girl
all the way home.

17:00.966 --> 17:03.433
and get out the car to try
to help her out, you know?

17:03.500 --> 17:08.031
and there on the door handle
was a bloody hook.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.999
that story isn't scary,

17:10.066 --> 17:12.165
not when you have
a bravery badge.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.532
you want to hear something
really scary?

17:14.599 --> 17:17.098
bring it, julia.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.165
okay.

17:19.233 --> 17:21.532
well, this is a true story
about an old witch

17:21.599 --> 17:23.400
who used to live
in these very woods.

17:25.199 --> 17:28.266
her name
was drag-leg laura.

17:28.333 --> 17:31.299
and they called her that
because she had a wooden leg.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.566
and you could always
hear laura coming

17:33.633 --> 17:37.066
because she would drag it
behind her in the mud.

17:41.700 --> 17:45.433
well, the day
after laura died,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.533
some kids decided that
they wanted to dig up her body

17:48.600 --> 17:50.199
and steal the wooden leg.

17:50.266 --> 17:52.767
so they took it
back to their tent.

17:52.833 --> 17:56.466
and then, just about midnight,
on a night just like tonight,

17:56.533 --> 17:58.233
they heard it.

18:00.099 --> 18:02.867
laura was coming back
for her leg.

18:07.466 --> 18:09.166
wow.
that was fast.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.600
it's because
she's a psychic,

18:10.666 --> 18:12.400
so she probably knew
that we were going to call her

18:12.466 --> 18:13.700
and started heading
over here.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.166
this is so creepy.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.032
oh, i'm sure
she's not that creepy.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.433
okay, she's creepy.

18:31.167 --> 18:33.067
nice going, hollywood.

18:33.133 --> 18:36.033
you scared the piss
out of chuck.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.733
good thing his mama packed
extra underwear.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.833
drag-leg laura works
every time.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.733
i wasn't scared.
it's just a story.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.666
drag-leg laura,
zip-lines --

18:46.733 --> 18:48.666
we're all scared
of something.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.499
not my dad.

18:50.566 --> 18:53.466
all right, buddy.
i think it's time for bed.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.232
all right.
good night, guys.

18:55.299 --> 18:56.666
good night.
good night.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.499
dad, i'm sorry
i didn't do the zip-line.

18:59.566 --> 19:00.733
it's okay, buddy.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.800
maybe tomorrow,
if you want, huh?

19:02.866 --> 19:04.700
sure.
all right.

19:04.766 --> 19:06.499
come here. ah.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.533
a million dollars
for your thoughts.

19:19.599 --> 19:22.000
and i'll throw in
back-end points.

19:23.299 --> 19:25.433
just thinking
about sweeps.

19:25.499 --> 19:28.366
you're right.
we need something big.

19:30.133 --> 19:33.599
maybe i come clean, show them
all that i've got a new heart,

19:33.666 --> 19:35.800
that i'm not really living
on borrowed time.

19:35.866 --> 19:38.199
you do that,
and all this goes away.

19:38.266 --> 19:40.299
maybe not.

19:40.366 --> 19:42.533
maybe they've really
been listening to what
i've been saying,

19:42.599 --> 19:44.033
and maybe
they'll forgive me.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.966
no.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.100
they'll tolerate
a criminal.

19:48.167 --> 19:49.766
they'll look the other way
at murder.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.766
but if they find out
that behind the curtain

19:51.833 --> 19:53.766
oz is just a man,
they'll never forgive you.

19:53.833 --> 19:57.733
eventually that clock has to
stop ticking, rachel.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.933
does it?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.466
you've given these people
something to believe in.

20:05.533 --> 20:08.133
don't take it away
to quiet your own guilt.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.399
thanks.

20:22.232 --> 20:25.167
i never said thank you,
mouth.

20:25.232 --> 20:27.199
you don't have to.

20:27.266 --> 20:30.167
yeah, but you spoke up for me
when nobody else would.

20:30.232 --> 20:32.199
i'm really sorry
you lost your job, man.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.766
there any chance
they take you back?

20:38.133 --> 20:40.199
probably not.

20:40.266 --> 20:42.966
i committed the cardinal sin
of broadcasting.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.266
i told people
to turn the channel.

20:45.332 --> 20:47.399
networks don't
really like that.

20:47.466 --> 20:51.067
yeah, well, the whole
landscape of television
is changing anyway.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.900
yeah, but what's next?

20:52.966 --> 20:55.000
the internet --

20:55.067 --> 20:57.766
it's faster, it's cheaper,
and it's everywhere.

21:00.033 --> 21:02.833
is your career path pretty much
just laid out for you

21:02.900 --> 21:05.399
as soon as your parents
name you zelda?

21:05.466 --> 21:08.966
zelda. it's kind of like
if they call you bambi or oprah.

21:09.033 --> 21:12.133
what are your questions
for the universe, my child?

21:12.199 --> 21:15.700
i'm sorry.
okay.

21:15.766 --> 21:20.800
will nathan play for the bobcats
this season?

21:29.800 --> 21:32.232
prospects are hazy.
ask again.

21:32.299 --> 21:35.067
you sound like
one of those magic 8-balls.

21:35.133 --> 21:38.033
you sound like you've been
eating pot brownies.

21:42.733 --> 21:45.133
okay,
best sports movie ever.

21:45.199 --> 21:47.266
easy.
"field of dreams."

21:47.332 --> 21:49.000
i'm gonna go
with "coach carter."

21:49.067 --> 21:50.133
ooh, strong.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.466
"cool runnings."

21:55.332 --> 21:57.433
seriously?
yeah.

21:57.499 --> 21:59.533
what, all the sports movies
of all time,

21:59.599 --> 22:02.199
and you're gonna -- you're gonna
pick "cool runnings"?

22:02.266 --> 22:03.499
yeah. i like it.

22:10.133 --> 22:14.966
"hoosiers" -- hands down,
best sports movie ever made.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.433
you're right --
definitely "hoosiers."

22:16.499 --> 22:18.800
i know the guy who coordinated
the basketball for that movie.

22:18.866 --> 22:20.433
what's that?

22:20.499 --> 22:22.733
well, you know, the actors don't
just make that stuff up.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.232
there's a sports coordinator
on set

22:24.299 --> 22:25.466
who comes up
with all the plays.

22:31.167 --> 22:34.000
i'm sensing something.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.033
it's julian, isn't it?

22:36.100 --> 22:37.700
it's julian.

22:37.766 --> 22:40.199
and he's --

22:40.266 --> 22:42.366
conflicted
about something, right?

22:42.433 --> 22:43.733
exactly.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.866
it's --

22:44.933 --> 22:46.133
alex dupré?

22:46.199 --> 22:48.167
yes.

22:48.232 --> 22:50.199
it's alex dupré.

22:50.266 --> 22:51.633
i knew it.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.433
zelda, you're good.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.566
you're creepy as hell,
but you are good.

22:57.633 --> 23:00.633
let's talk about what alex dupré
look like naked.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.033
oh, let me guess --
chase adams.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.232
i thought bartenders

23:04.299 --> 23:05.933
were supposed to keep
their mouths shut.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.399
yeah, and they're also supposed
to make good drinks, too.

23:08.466 --> 23:11.666
all:
enjoy the buzz.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.499
so, that's what you meant

23:13.566 --> 23:14.966
by not that bad
once you get to know her.

23:15.033 --> 23:16.933
it was
a misunderstanding --

23:17.000 --> 23:20.133
a very brief, somewhat naked
misunderstanding.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.800
yeah, there ain't
nothing wrong

23:21.866 --> 23:23.933
with a little window-shopping,
either, right?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.900
yeah, well,
she's no brooke davis.

23:25.966 --> 23:28.232
but you guys have all seen her
naked on film.

23:30.266 --> 23:31.733
wait.
who we talking about?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.199
alex -- she's the only actress
in hollywood

23:34.266 --> 23:36.366
who insists
on doing nudity.

23:38.433 --> 23:40.067
yeah, alex -- that's --
that's what i thought.

23:43.866 --> 23:45.067
wait, who are you
talking about?

23:46.466 --> 23:47.299
skills.

23:51.366 --> 23:52.466
skills.
skills.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.332
nathan and brooke kind of made
a sex tape in high school.

23:58.633 --> 23:59.966
okay.

24:00.033 --> 24:01.299
good night.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.933
see you guys
in the morning.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.332
or maybe
just one of you.

24:21.167 --> 24:24.433
i never told nathan
we were married.

24:24.499 --> 24:25.966
why not?

24:28.199 --> 24:30.533
there was never
a good time.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.933
to mention
you had a wife?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.299
i know.

24:35.366 --> 24:37.399
it's just...

24:37.466 --> 24:38.866
people mean well,

24:38.933 --> 24:41.900
but they don't really know
what to say.

24:41.966 --> 24:44.366
they try, but just...

24:47.199 --> 24:50.366
...after a while,
it was just easier not to.

24:52.232 --> 24:56.266
for who -- you or them?

24:56.332 --> 24:58.800
i don't know.

24:58.866 --> 25:01.199
them?

25:02.800 --> 25:05.399
both, maybe.

25:07.499 --> 25:09.466
well, it might help you
to tell someone.

25:11.633 --> 25:15.167
and it might really help you
to tell the right someone.

25:18.599 --> 25:20.866
there's a man
in your life.

25:20.933 --> 25:23.433
he's suffered a great loss.

25:23.499 --> 25:25.067
he's struggling.

25:25.133 --> 25:27.199
my husband, david.

25:27.266 --> 25:30.100
no, it's not david.

25:30.167 --> 25:33.000
but whoever it is,

25:33.067 --> 25:36.167
i'm getting the strong feeling
that he needs you right now.

25:39.966 --> 25:44.000
ooh, magic 8-ball,
is zelda really psychic?

25:44.067 --> 25:46.766
what?
outlook not so good.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.033
i told you.
she's a total fake.

25:49.499 --> 25:53.666
magic 8-ball, is zelda standing
right behind us?

25:53.733 --> 25:55.033
you may rely on it.

26:01.599 --> 26:04.232
you're not alone
in this house.

26:04.299 --> 26:05.700
what?

26:05.766 --> 26:08.199
wait!
zelda, you can't do that.

26:08.266 --> 26:12.933
oryctolagus cuniculus.

26:15.499 --> 26:17.800
she just cursed us.

26:17.866 --> 26:21.800
quinn, your creepy psychic
just cursed us.

26:21.866 --> 26:24.199
okay.
on that note, i got to go.

26:24.266 --> 26:26.332
no, quinn, you can't --
the brownies.

26:26.399 --> 26:29.733
yeah, i didn't actually have
any brownies.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.133
someone had to keep an eye
on you two rookies.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.299
and you're gonna come down
any minute, i promise.

26:36.566 --> 26:39.067
i knew that woman would bring
a demon into your house.

26:39.133 --> 26:41.366
hey, that's kind of harsh.
she's still my sister.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.533
not quinn.
zelda.

26:43.599 --> 26:47.167
she said we're not alone.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.266
oh, stop it.
i'm sure we're perfectly safe.

26:59.467 --> 27:01.533
if there is an evil spirit
in this house,

27:01.599 --> 27:04.567
this is definitely the best way
to keep it from killing us.

27:04.632 --> 27:07.133
it's just a mass-produced
board game, dude.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.866
that doesn't matter,
dude.

27:08.933 --> 27:11.133
now, what did zelda say?

27:11.200 --> 27:14.233
oryctolagus something.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.899
oryctolagus...
cunniling--

27:18.966 --> 27:21.300
it wasn't that.
you're so bad.

27:21.366 --> 27:23.433
you're right.
i wouldn't be afraid of that.

27:24.833 --> 27:27.300
okay.
let's do it.
okay.

27:27.366 --> 27:29.766
oh, great ouija board,

27:29.833 --> 27:33.799
is there a mean spirit
in this house?

27:35.632 --> 27:37.200
you're pushing it.
i'm not, i swear.

27:37.266 --> 27:38.699
you totally are.
i'm not. okay, fine,
don't touch it.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.699
ouija board...

27:45.766 --> 27:49.632
is there anyone
in this house?

27:57.799 --> 27:59.999
so, let me
get this straight.

28:00.066 --> 28:02.533
you were on a break
from peyton --

28:02.599 --> 28:04.366
nathan: oh, come on.
it was eight years ago.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.467
i was so drunk,
i don't even remember.

28:06.533 --> 28:07.533
well, good thing
you got it on tape.

28:07.599 --> 28:09.033
just let it go.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.999
it's a nice tent.

28:14.066 --> 28:16.133
i have a lambskin sleeping bag.
i'm quite warm.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.966
don't change the subject.

28:19.033 --> 28:21.799
look, i get it.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.533
the idea of me and brooke
is weird for you.

28:24.599 --> 28:27.632
i lost my virginity
to my sister-in-law.

28:27.699 --> 28:29.133
you don't think
that makes thanksgiving

28:29.200 --> 28:30.467
a little awkward
from time to time?

28:32.599 --> 28:35.033
you still awake?

28:35.100 --> 28:36.933
yeah.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.866
what'd you think
about what julian said?

28:38.933 --> 28:42.266
i don't know.
maybe he's right.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.500
<i>maybe i could have my own
sports show on the internet.</i>

28:44.567 --> 28:46.200
then i could say
anything i want.

28:46.266 --> 28:50.066
call the website
something like raw mouth.

28:51.866 --> 28:54.066
i'm pretty sure
that's already taken.

28:56.033 --> 28:58.333
my father's new wife
is my age,

28:58.400 --> 29:01.899
and she hit on me after she
slept with my uncle cooper.

29:01.966 --> 29:03.300
yeah.

29:03.366 --> 29:06.266
don't even get me started
on my dad.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.300
yeah, your old man
and my old man

29:08.366 --> 29:10.233
should get together
and go bowling.

29:11.799 --> 29:13.166
"breakfast club."

29:13.233 --> 29:15.732
you really got to quit
with the movie quotes, man.

29:15.799 --> 29:17.999
i can quit that.

29:18.066 --> 29:20.799
but i wish i knew how to quit you.

29:20.866 --> 29:23.467
okay, so enough about
your new porn site.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.732
i'm talking
about the "hoosiers" thing.

29:25.799 --> 29:26.966
see, i was planning
on starting

29:27.033 --> 29:28.266
my own business
training athletes, right?

29:28.333 --> 29:30.100
but sports coordinating --

29:30.166 --> 29:32.599
i think i'd be good
at that.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.133
you'd be great at that.

29:39.599 --> 29:41.200
julian's cool.

29:41.266 --> 29:43.166
that's not cool, man.

29:43.233 --> 29:44.899
lighten up, francis.

29:44.966 --> 29:47.433
everybody loves a good
"brokeback mountain" joke.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.732
not when you're over there

29:48.799 --> 29:50.266
sleeping
in your lambskin condom.

29:50.333 --> 29:51.666
oh, you should talk.

29:51.732 --> 29:53.599
you're the one who showers
with dudes on a nightly basis.

29:55.233 --> 29:55.266
you think drag-leg laura
is real?

29:57.632 --> 30:01.333
<i>nah.
i can tell you a real story.</i>

30:05.166 --> 30:10.632
it's about this girl
named nanny carrie.

30:10.699 --> 30:14.200
and it
actually happened...

30:14.266 --> 30:15.866
to me.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.300
you're good with the kid,
you know that?

30:20.366 --> 30:23.433
i've had my moments,
believe me.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.100
yeah, but your dad
was a dick,

30:25.166 --> 30:27.766
and yet somehow you turned it
around for your own son.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.833
they should give a merit badge
for that.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.300
zelda said julian's conflicted
about something.

30:40.366 --> 30:42.966
i -- listen,
i realize the irony

30:43.033 --> 30:45.300
of the following
statement,

30:45.366 --> 30:49.300
but you can't take everything
zelda says too seriously.

30:49.366 --> 30:52.899
i feel it, haley.

30:52.966 --> 30:55.200
brooke,
that boy loves you.

30:55.266 --> 30:58.966
he would move mountains for you
if you asked him to.

30:59.033 --> 31:01.699
i don't know.

31:01.766 --> 31:04.632
what if the guy i want to spend
the rest of my life with

31:04.699 --> 31:06.567
doesn't feel the same way?

31:06.632 --> 31:09.133
that's just
the brownies talking.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.799
no, i think
they're wearing off.

31:11.866 --> 31:15.133
julian: i could see spending
the rest of my life with brooke,

31:15.200 --> 31:16.999
but i know she wants kids.

31:17.066 --> 31:19.567
and i don't know
if i'm ready for that.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.200
i don't know
if i'll ever be.

31:23.266 --> 31:25.300
jamie likes you.

31:25.366 --> 31:27.233
jamie likes
that i suck at stuff.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.666
what do you mean?

31:28.732 --> 31:31.300
i'm just saying when you have
superman for a father,

31:31.366 --> 31:33.599
sometimes it's nice
to hang around with clark kent.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.799
rain? really?

31:40.866 --> 31:42.300
i wouldn't worry.

31:42.366 --> 31:44.732
i hear lambskin is the safest
form of protection.

31:44.799 --> 31:45.699
you'll be fine.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.666
all right.
come on.

31:57.599 --> 32:00.033
you should've gone
on the camping trip.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.933
i wanted to spend time
with you.

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
you're not with me, clay.
you're alone.

32:06.732 --> 32:08.467
and i don't want you
to be.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.333
what can i say?
i'm good.

32:27.300 --> 32:28.966
let her in.

32:37.799 --> 32:38.732
hi.

32:38.799 --> 32:39.999
hey.

32:40.066 --> 32:42.366
look, i know this
is gonna sound weird,

32:42.433 --> 32:44.666
but are you okay?

32:44.732 --> 32:47.567
yeah. i'm fine.
why?

32:47.632 --> 32:50.766
well, it's just --
never mind.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.533
can i come in?

32:54.933 --> 32:56.500
no.

32:56.567 --> 32:59.300
when are you
gonna get it, quinn?

32:59.366 --> 33:01.833
you can't be here.

33:01.899 --> 33:03.599
you need to go.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.999
i'm sorry.

33:37.066 --> 33:39.133
i don't get it.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.833
i-i don't even know
what i'm doing.

33:40.899 --> 33:42.833
i mean, i don't know
what we're doing.

33:42.899 --> 33:43.966
are we even doing
anything?

33:46.233 --> 33:47.933
i like you, quinn.

33:47.999 --> 33:49.632
it -- it's just...

33:53.066 --> 33:54.666
her name was sara.

33:58.966 --> 34:00.866
and i loved her.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.467
she was my wife.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.799
but, um...

34:09.866 --> 34:11.998
she died.

34:14.065 --> 34:19.132
and i've never told anyone...
up until now.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.500
it was sudden.

34:35.467 --> 34:37.899
it was just one minute
she was there,

34:37.966 --> 34:39.833
and the next
she was gone.

34:42.266 --> 34:45.533
so that's when i just threw
myself into my work.

34:45.599 --> 34:49.233
but i learned that it doesn't
matter how fast you run.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.567
the pain will always
run faster.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.632
that's when my life

34:54.699 --> 34:57.866
just went completely
off the rails.

34:57.933 --> 35:01.366
and that's why your agency
sent you to tree hill.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.732
yeah.

35:03.799 --> 35:06.999
and that's also why i told you
to go back to david.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.166
i know what it's like
to lose the one thing

35:11.233 --> 35:13.732
that you love more than anything
in this world.

35:15.567 --> 35:18.666
i'm so sorry, clay.

35:18.732 --> 35:21.333
i wish there was something
i could do for you.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.632
you're doing it, quinn.

35:38.200 --> 35:43.156
you're alive, baby.
you have a new heart.

36:15.899 --> 36:15.966
rachel.

36:18.133 --> 36:19.999
where'd you get
the heart?

36:20.066 --> 36:21.999
what are you
talking about?

36:22.066 --> 36:24.133
it was a boy,
wasn't it?

36:24.200 --> 36:27.166
he was on life support.

36:27.233 --> 36:30.433
i paid his family the money,
and they pulled the plug.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.200
you paid them?

36:33.933 --> 36:35.599
he might have
gotten better.

36:35.666 --> 36:38.933
we bought his death.
we killed him.

36:38.999 --> 36:41.467
i did what i had to do
to save your life.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.699
i'm not a murderer, dan.

36:45.766 --> 36:47.533
that would be you.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.200
whoa, whoa, whoa.
what's going on?

36:56.266 --> 36:58.233
drag-leg laura!
listen!

37:00.333 --> 37:02.766
that's definitely
drag-leg laura.

37:02.833 --> 37:03.966
what are we gonna do?

37:04.033 --> 37:06.366
well, the only way
to get rid of her

37:06.433 --> 37:08.899
is to catch her in the eyes with
the beam of your flashlight.

37:08.966 --> 37:12.233
don't worry.
my dad will do it.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.866
what?
no. no.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.200
no way i'm going out there, man.
i'm way too scared.

37:22.666 --> 37:24.899
all right.
i'll go.

38:10.666 --> 38:12.666
hey, guys,
it's not drag-leg laura.

38:12.732 --> 38:14.433
it's just some
stupid old gate.

38:19.467 --> 38:22.433
wow, jamie.
that was awesome.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.233
jamie scott --
one bravery badge.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.333
yes.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.799
chuck, you might want to go
change your underwear again.

38:32.166 --> 38:33.766
all right, buddy.

38:37.766 --> 38:40.300
okay.

38:40.366 --> 38:42.732
if this is our last night on
earth, i just want you to know

38:42.799 --> 38:44.866
that i am really glad
we are spending it together.

38:44.933 --> 38:46.433
no, this is silly.
you are just paranoid.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.433
we weren't even hearing things.
it was just the brownies.

38:51.966 --> 38:53.599
it's coming
from the closet.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.500
whew.

39:01.233 --> 39:04.133
this is ridiculous.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.300
cuniculus.

39:06.366 --> 39:07.500
what?

39:07.567 --> 39:08.632
oryctolagus...

39:08.699 --> 39:09.632
cuniculus!cuniculus!

39:10.830 --> 39:12.632
that's what zelda said.

39:12.699 --> 39:18.057
the evil spirit...
in the closet.

39:19.366 --> 39:20.467
here i come.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.133
wait!

39:24.200 --> 39:26.500
oryctolagus cuniculus --

39:26.567 --> 39:28.100
the latin word

39:28.166 --> 39:29.899
for "bunny rabbit."

39:31.333 --> 39:34.666
that zelda's a bitch.

39:36.033 --> 39:39.599
kids are finally back asleep.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.200
how'd you know
about the creaky gate?

39:44.266 --> 39:47.166
oh, i--i just saw it
when i was out getting firewood.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.166
nice performance.

39:51.233 --> 39:53.966
julian.

39:54.033 --> 39:56.500
you knew
jamie needed that.

39:56.567 --> 39:59.066
oh, it was no big deal.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.400
hey, being a father
is 95% instinct.

40:01.467 --> 40:02.866
and you have good ones.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.333
when the day comes,
you'll be ready.

40:07.699 --> 40:09.133
thanks, man.

40:13.699 --> 40:17.166
you know, that was
my first-ever fist bump.

40:17.233 --> 40:18.699
don't overthink it.

40:27.166 --> 40:30.666
come back to bed, baby.
you need rest.

40:30.732 --> 40:34.467
you're right.
i do.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.899
in fact,
i've been thinking.

40:36.966 --> 40:38.999
maybe we need
a vacation.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.500
now, that's my boy.

40:42.567 --> 40:47.699
where do you want to go --
the bahamas, hawaii?

40:49.732 --> 40:51.400
tree hill.

40:51.467 --> 40:53.333
i want to go home.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.500
it's almost morning.
i should go.

41:00.433 --> 41:04.100
or, uh, you could stay.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.833
tell me more about sara.

41:15.866 --> 41:18.033
she would've
really liked you.
