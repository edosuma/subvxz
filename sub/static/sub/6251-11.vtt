12:20.449 --> 12:22.861
and send the samples
with the ball bearings.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.988
Well, there’s no striations
on the ball bearings
in this photo you sent,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.331
so there’s no evidence
that they were shot.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.371
Shotgun maybe?
Full of ball bearings.

12:30.459 --> 12:34.202
Well, the owner of the ranch
threatened us with a shotgun.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.753
[ Saroyan ]
Not so fast,
Dr. Brennan.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.831
I know you dislike flesh,
but I’m going to need you...

12:38.926 --> 12:41.633
to remove
the adipocere and organs
and send them to me.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.925
Ooh, Dr. Brennan
dealing with flesh.
Like a cat dealing with water.

12:45.015 --> 12:49.349
- Flesh is not my strength.
- You’re gonna need a hair dryer
and some cooking spray.

12:56.526 --> 13:00.895
Yep. I’ve caught
her trespassing on
my ranch a bunch of times.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.398
That’s El Crazerita.
El Crazerita.
You know her real name?

13:04.493 --> 13:07.155
Nope. I don’t make friends
with these nuts.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.156
Sheriff Bonds
says you’ve been charged
with misdemeanor assault...

13:09.247 --> 13:10.953
with a firearm
about three times.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.498
Someone cut through
this fence, Agent Booth.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.543
They were trespassers,
which is why I was
never convicted.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.628
Eventhough
you shot at them?
Salt.

13:18.757 --> 13:22.295
Salt?
Salt. Rock salt.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.549
Stings like a sumbitch.
Discourages trespassing.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.846
You ever use ball bearings
instead of salt?

13:27.933 --> 13:31.676
Ball bearings? Shoot.
That’d rip somebody apart.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.103
Hmm. Like when you
took a shot at, uh,
ol’ El Crazerita?

13:35.190 --> 13:37.772
You think I killed her?

13:37.859 --> 13:40.145
You think I’m dumb enough
to spend my life in prison...

13:40.237 --> 13:42.228
for killing
some alien-head nut...

13:42.322 --> 13:44.187
who spent all her time
shooting stupid videos?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.532
Videos? Videos of what?
Videos of everything.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.905
Looking for spacemen.

13:49.997 --> 13:54.457
You wanna know about her?
Ask Blaine Miller
at the Space Place Cafe.

13:54.543 --> 13:58.206
She was always
hanging out at his diner
with the other fruitcakes.

13:58.296 --> 14:02.881
Sure. Tell you what. I’ll take
a look at your shotgun and run
some tests just to make sure.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.015
Oh! I did it.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.688
- Very good, Dr. Brennan.
- Yes, it was.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.393
- Now remove the stomach.
- Oh.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.230
She was covered
in ethyl parathion
and aldicarb.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.406
it was all over
her space-age outerwear.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.405
it’s an insecticide.
it’s extremely illegal
in the U. 8.,

14:31.496 --> 14:33.532
but it’s still sold
south of the border.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.830
It explains
why the adipocere
dried so quickly.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.499
[ Saroyan ]
So our victim was using
a dangerous insecticide.

14:38.587 --> 14:42.546
Not unusual for someone
who’s a couple of tacos
short of a combo plate.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.585
Nice metaphor.
Thanks.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.008
/ found something.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.806
It’s a memory card...
tied to a string.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.134
It appears
to be dental floss.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.345
Check her teeth.
Any evidence of floss
still on her teeth?

15:01.693 --> 15:06.187
Yes. There’s a fragment tied
to the left second premolar.

15:06.281 --> 15:09.068
She was hiding the card.
It’s an old prison trick.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.572
She tied one end of the floss
to her tooth and the other end
to the memory card.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.404
So if she needed it,
she could use the floss
to pull it up.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.332
I’ll overnight the card
to Angela.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.504
My guess—
it’s important enough
to kill for.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.428
[ Wendell]
Hey, Hodgins.

15:35.519 --> 15:40.138
Hey, man. Did you hear?
Brennan ’s sending the Victims
SD card from Roswell

15:40.232 --> 15:43.065
Probably video on there
the government
wanted suppressed.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.149
Because at Area 51—
Right. Um—

15:45.278 --> 15:48.361
Look, do you have a second?
Sure. Yeah.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.313
Something wrong?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.984
We’re friends, right?
Yeah.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.412
I don’t lie or keep things
from my friends.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.206
Okay. All right.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.579
Angela and l—

16:02.671 --> 16:04.582
Oh.
[Laughs]

16:04.673 --> 16:06.629
You’re kidding, right?
[Laughs]

16:06.716 --> 16:09.253
Go ahead, kid.
Knock yourself out.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.300
Hey, good luck with that.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.255
Hodgins, what I’m trying
to tell you is that my luck
has already been good.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.595
Oh.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.927
I would never want you
to think that—

16:20.021 --> 16:22.148
Look, Wendell—
Wen-Wendell, stop. Stop. Stop.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.348
It’s been over between
Angela and me for a long time.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.275
I have moved on.
And you know what?
I’m happy for you.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.941
You know? And for her.
Really?

16:30.031 --> 16:31.987
Yes. Really.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.737
Dude, you’re both my friends.
Why wouldn’t I be happy for you?

16:34.828 --> 16:37.160
I don’t—
[ Chuckles ]

16:37.247 --> 16:39.863
Okay. Thanks, man.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.949
Of course. I’ll tell you what.

16:42.043 --> 16:46.002
Hey, why don’t the three of us
grab lunch together, huh?

16:46.089 --> 16:49.331
This is a good thing.
Wendell, this should not be weird for us.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.133
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Lunch.
That sounds great, man.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.131
Great. Good. Good.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.675
The stomach acid
ate away at the card,

16:59.769 --> 17:01.725
but Angela says she should
be able to pull something
off of it.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.145
Well, Vinton said
El Crazerita shot
a lot of video.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.765
Maybe she filmed
the real thing.
What, an extraterrestrial?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.226
Yeah. Look, you said
it was possible, all right?

17:09.321 --> 17:13.360
But they have big eyes
and big heads, you know,
for the super-smart brain.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.362
Well, it’s far more logical
if they had the eyes of flies...

17:16.453 --> 17:18.444
and the exoskeleton
of a cockroach.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.951
Insect people.
Insects can’t fly a spaceship.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.875
Well, the cockroach
is an evolutionary marvel.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.203
They can withstand radiation,
live without breathing
for almost an hour,

17:28.298 --> 17:30.539
go without eating
for weeks.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.502
Imagine that combined
with an intelligence that
evolved over many millennia.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.338
Plus, they do have
extra arms.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.807
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.228
[ Booth ]
Wow. Would you
look at this place.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.903
Wow. This is so cool.

17:52.989 --> 17:57.198
“U.F.O. Museum Research Center.”
Check this out. Look at those guns.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.118
No way. Bones, look at this.
Rocketsh/p 7.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.911
Hey, I used to watch that
when I was a little boy.

18:01.998 --> 18:05.286
The Sweetlys,
and there was Mr. Beeper
and Promo the Robot.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.789
Well, the way
this craft is designed,

18:07.879 --> 18:09.870
it could never leave
the Earth’s atmosphere.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.206
Hmm. Yeah. But according
to Dave Thomas
on Rocketsh/p 7,

18:12.300 --> 18:14.382
you would go
on adventures
like no other.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.676
You two looking for aliens?
The name’s Blaine Miller.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.716
Not exactly.
Oh.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.763
Oh, you’re here about that body
they found up at Vinton’s place.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.387
We never mentioned
a body, Mr. Miller.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.641
Nothing travels faster
than the speed of light
than gossip in a small town.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.894
Excuse me, sir.
Why are all
these radios on?

18:29.985 --> 18:32.021
Oh, well, this is some
of the original equipment...

18:32.112 --> 18:34.819
that picked up the signal
from the craft that landed
right here in Roswell.

18:34.906 --> 18:39.320
Dave, these are the radios
that heard the aliens.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.402
- [ Dave ] Oh.
- But that’s absurd.
Why would she believe you?

18:41.496 --> 18:44.738
Because they travel all the way
to Roswell to believe in aliens,
just like everybody else.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.370
Do you recognize
this woman, Mr. Miller?

18:47.460 --> 18:51.078
Sure. This is
Ursula Lapine.
She’s a regular.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.037
She the one
who’s dead?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.631
When was the last time
you saw her?
Maybe a month ago.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.335
She was having an argument
with another woman.
I had to tell her to keep it down.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.803
And who was this other woman?
I don’t know.
I never saw her before.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.801
African—American,
good looking, in a suit.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.974
This woman, Ursula,
she live around here .7

19:05.061 --> 19:08.724
Outside of town.
She’s in one of those
shiny, spaceship-type trailers.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.931
I think
I hear something.

19:11.026 --> 19:14.564
- I think
I hear a spaceship.
- [ Laughing ]

19:18.199 --> 19:20.235
She was serious?

19:23.330 --> 19:26.242
This must be the place.
Spacey-looking trailer.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.120
Oh, one of the windows
is broken.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.292
All right.
Stay behind me, Bones.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.588
[Bird Screeching ]

20:01.785 --> 20:06.404
- Bones, I think
you need to see this.
- And you need to see this.

20:06.498 --> 20:10.537
- There’s blood on it.
- Could’ve been what
busted her knees.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.834
You got to check this out.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.419
She seems
very thorough.
Hmm.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.501
[Booth ]
The word “loon y”
come to mind?

20:20.595 --> 20:24.713
This is a remarkably
well-researched wall
for a crazerita.

20:24.808 --> 20:28.266
Crazerita’s right.
How about this here? Look.
Check this out, huh?

20:28.353 --> 20:30.719
- Something was taken.
- Maybe that’s why
Ursula was killed.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.226
Well, the cinder block
was obviously used
in an assault.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.349
We have
to analyze the blood.
You know what?

20:35.443 --> 20:39.937
Maybe we can pull a print
off the block like this.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.486
[ Blowing ]

20:44.577 --> 20:46.693
All right. Watch this.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.699
This—

20:53.753 --> 20:57.211
That... is magic.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.799
Science.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.883
Did you have any luck?
Was the data damaged?

21:05.974 --> 21:09.182
A bit. There might still be
a few corrupted frames.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.972
So it’s video.
Yeah, but I think
it’s gonna play.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.019
[ Beeping ]

21:15.775 --> 21:18.562
[Ange/a ]
Oh, my God.
is that what / think it is?

21:18.653 --> 21:21.360
- And are those—
- No.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.613
lmp058/b/e.
This was doctored.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.612
No, it isn’t.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.365
This was verified
by the scanning software
at a pixel level.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.208
Are you saying our victim
might have stumbled on
a real U.F.O.?

21:48.224 --> 21:51.967
So assuming that the figures
in the hazmat suits
are of average height,

21:52.061 --> 21:56.020
then this structure here
must be about four
to five meters tall.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.850
- Why is the ground glowing?
- The light seems to be emitting
from a spilled liquid.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.977
U.F.O. fuel.
Uh—

22:02.071 --> 22:04.733
What are those two
humanoid shapes there...

22:04.824 --> 22:08.191
between the hazmat-suited
humans and the craft?

22:08.286 --> 22:10.402
Well, look, I’m gonna keep
working on this footage,

22:10.497 --> 22:15.161
but you guys have to admit
that this makes the hairs
on your arm stand on end, right?

22:15.251 --> 22:18.334
The hairs on my arm
are not reacting in any way.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.788
But thanks, Angela.
It’s not a spaceship.

22:21.883 --> 22:24.920
If it smells like a duck,
walks like a duck,
quacks like a duck—

22:25.011 --> 22:29.129
But then it would be a duck,
not a spaceship,
so your point escapes me.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.472
It’s just a metaphor—
Have you decided
to let me go?

22:31.559 --> 22:35.051
We have a few more questions.
You ever been out to
Ursula Lapine’s trailer?

22:35.146 --> 22:37.979
- No.
- Oh. We have evidence
that you’re lying.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.024
- Yep. You fell
into that one, Delmy.
- We have your fingerprints...

22:41.110 --> 22:43.852
on a cinder block
that was used
to break into her trailer.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.734
- Also, blood.
- And you took
something off her wall.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.911
If I give it to you,
will you drop the trespassing
charges and let me go?

22:52.997 --> 22:55.955
If you don’t hand it over, I’ll just
charge you with obstructing justice,

22:56.042 --> 22:58.954
and he’ll charge you with interfering
with a federal investigation...

22:59.045 --> 23:02.412
and maybe even murder, and you
will pray for the good ol’ days...

23:02.507 --> 23:03.963
where all you were
worrying about...

23:04.050 --> 23:06.792
were those silly little trespassing
and burglary charges.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.261
I find he’s very useful
in certain situations.
Very useful.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.680
So, gonna hand ’em over?

23:15.979 --> 23:17.970
Ooh.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.472
Holy cow.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.976
Pay dirt.
[ Brennan ]
Whoa.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.107
[Bonds ]
/ got to get better
at frisking.

23:27.198 --> 23:30.190
Wait a minute.
This is Ursula with Marvin.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.704
l’m gonna need a copy
for my article—

23:33.788 --> 23:37.622
“UFO-obsessed Woman
Dies in Alien Encounter.”

23:41.254 --> 23:44.963
[Beeps]
So the swab from the victim’s
damaged patellas...

23:45.049 --> 23:47.256
show traces of sediment,
but it’s not cement.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.254
So what hit her knees
wasn’t cinder block?

23:49.345 --> 23:54.055
No, the sediment is gypsum,
dating back to the Pleistocene
and Holocene eras.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.054
It’s probably from
the Tularosa or Estancia Basins.

23:57.186 --> 24:00.678
Mexico?
Yeah. Northern Mexico is
the closest occurrence of this rock.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.604
Now, here’s an interesting
conjunction possibility.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.775
The insecticide
that she was soaked in,
it’s called Tres Pasitos.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.773
It’s not available
in the United States.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.112
Is it available in Mexico?
Readily.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.190
Excellent.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.742
So I took
the information
that you gave me,

24:14.829 --> 24:20.540
and it looks as though
the projectiles first
impacted next to the juncture...

24:20.627 --> 24:22.868
between the frontal
and parietal bones.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.954
So the bearings
entered beneath her chin, then
richocheted around in her skull.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.914
Yeah. That seems
to make the most sense.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.967
But I’ve never heard
of any projectiles that
would enter at that range...

24:31.054 --> 24:33.045
and not fracture the skull.

24:33.139 --> 24:37.678
Well, what about, like,
slow-moving projectiles?
Maybe a paintball gun?

24:37.769 --> 24:41.978
A little more powerful
than that, but not much.

24:42.065 --> 24:44.727
- Time for lunch.
- Oh.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.773
To prove we’re all fine?

24:46.861 --> 24:48.772
Yeah.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.442
[Sighs]

24:52.658 --> 24:54.910
[ Booth ]
It looks like a spaceship.
It wasn’t.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.610
And those two shapes
on the ground—
those could have been aliens.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.783
[ Chuckles ]
They weren’t.
How do you know?

24:59.874 --> 25:03.241
There’s absolutely no reason
for an advanced civilization
to visit New Mexico.

25:03.378 --> 25:07.496
Desert is beautiful.
Say you grow up on a jungle planet
or an ocean planet.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.626
Wouldn’t you enjoy, like,
little change of scenery?

25:09.717 --> 25:11.708
No. Most planets
are basically desert.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.010
Why come this far
for more of the same?

25:14.097 --> 25:16.053
Neither one of you
know what you’re talking about.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.756
I told you before,
there are two types of aliens...

25:18.851 --> 25:21.012
in a power struggle
over our planet.

25:21.104 --> 25:24.221
There are the cold, heartless,
sou/less scientific aliens...

25:24.315 --> 25:26.226
who look at us
like we’re just experiments,

25:26.317 --> 25:29.059
and then there are
our secret allies
who want to help.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.769
They’re not as
technologically advanced,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.650
but they are wiser
and adaptable.

25:33.741 --> 25:37.950
Unlikely. A war between
two such disparate forces would
have ripped this planet apart.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.947
Wow. Kind of cool.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.255
[ Woman ]
Hey, Doc.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.931
You guys
can hold hands
if you want.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.009
Eat off
each other’s plates.

26:03.104 --> 26:07.268
I mean, any and all of that
kind of gooey romanticism
is completely fine by me.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.690
We know, Hodgins.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.564
I’m not really
the public display
kind of guy. [Chuckles]

26:12.655 --> 26:15.067
I’m just saying
you don’t need
to be afraid or—

26:23.332 --> 26:25.948
There. See?
My head did not explode.

26:26.043 --> 26:30.878
Um, I’m not really okay with being kissed
when it’s not about me.

26:30.965 --> 26:34.457
Sorry. Panicked,
but everything’s fine, right?

26:34.552 --> 26:37.760
- Everything’s fine.
- Everything’s not fine.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.511
This is a fraught situation.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.310
It’s important to face
these things head-on.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.355
I mean, we can see
why you’d think that.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.528
But we’re all fine.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.232
lam. I’m-I’m fine.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.491
[ Woman]
Lance, your order’s ready.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.072
Thanks.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.835
[ Breekman ]
Why are we here?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.834
We wanna know
what brought you out here
the night you found Ursula’s body.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.261
I told you. I was out
U.F.O.-spotting.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.339
And I told you I don’t believe
in that big of a coincidence.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.890
How long were you
and Ursula lovers?
Go ahead. Take a look.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.599
Oh, my God.

27:31.442 --> 27:35.185
Ursula understood.
Sh-She believed.

27:35.279 --> 27:37.440
My wife
thought I was crazy.

27:37.532 --> 27:42.071
What makes this patch of desert
any different to you than
any other patch of desert?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.777
This is where we were
when we first saw the lights.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.205
- Where did you see the lights?
- Beyond those hills.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.283
Hot spheres, very clear.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.253
Ursula and I
saw them together.
How far?

27:55.424 --> 27:58.712
- Maybe two kilometers.
- That would be Mexico.

27:58.803 --> 28:01.715
We were gonna
check it out together
next time I came through town.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.922
We— We’d meet
every few weeks.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.175
So you and Ursula
were true believers.
Not really.

28:07.270 --> 28:09.261
Ursula—
she was convinced...

28:09.355 --> 28:13.519
that if she could find proof
of alien visitation,
it would make her rich.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.521
What happened
to her, Marvin? Really.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.477
What do you think?

28:20.533 --> 28:23.570
I think she came
out here without me.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.744
Maybe she thought
I wanted half her money.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.948
She maybe saw all the lights
and crossed over,

28:30.042 --> 28:33.910
and they took her
and experimented on her,

28:34.005 --> 28:35.961
and then they dumped Ursula
in the desert...

28:36.048 --> 28:38.209
like the cold, heartless
scientists that they are.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.717
So the footage was
pretty rough, as you saw.

28:49.854 --> 28:54.393
So I ran an application to
counteract the motion of the
camera with opposite movement.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.769
Then I translated each pixel
of the infrared spectrum...

28:56.861 --> 28:59.648
into a pixel
of the visible color spectrum.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.355
Okay. Let’s see it.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.201
[ Beeping ]

29:12.293 --> 29:15.160
Well, that’s
a lot more terrestrial
than / expected.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.041
Two tanker trucks.
Some sort of digger.

29:19.634 --> 29:23.092
And this is a hose.
What do you think,
three inches ?

29:23.179 --> 29:25.716
That’s the source
of the glowing liquid

29:25.806 --> 29:28.798
But what about
the alien things?

29:28.893 --> 29:32.806
Fremontodendron mexicanum.

29:32.897 --> 29:35.354

Weird, glowing liquid
in the Mexican desert.

Oh! They must’ve been
dumping chemicals illegal/y.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.531
[ Saroyan ] Oop. She fell.
That must have been where
she fractured her knees.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.864
You guys
see what happened?

29:49.955 --> 29:52.742
She was out
looking for U.F.O.’s,
but found this instead.

29:52.833 --> 29:58.078
- These guys killed her.
- I think I liked this
all better when it was aliens.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.838
Sol was able to clarify
the chem/luminescent
signature. . .

30:08.933 --> 30:10.924
of the materials
being dumped in the video.

30:11.018 --> 30:14.476
Manganese and sodium borohydride.
Used in the manufacture of batteries.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.100
Can you get a specific
manufacturer from that?

I did. lnnatron.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.941

of extinction, right?

located smack-dab...

30:24.782 --> 30:27.114
in the middle
of the last remaining
flannelbush population—

30:27.201 --> 30:31.410
here in Juarez—
and they use manganese
and sodium borohydride.

of in the middle of—

You were right, Sweets.
Everything is not fine.

It’s not fine at all.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.281
This is a good time.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.949
I don’t know if I wanna
crawl into a hole and die or...

31:10.035 --> 31:12.242
run over Wendell and Angela
with a truck.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.536

to have those feelings.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.875
I’m a better man than this.

I mean, I—
I wanna be happy for them.
You know? I really do.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.754
Well, it’s easier
for us to accept loneliness...

31:23.841 --> 31:27.333
as long as the person
we were once with
is also alone.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.419
And when she finds happiness
with someone else,

31:29.513 --> 31:31.925
oh, man, it’s like being
stabbed in the heart.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.881
It’s the human condition.

and plays and songs and poems.

What do I do?

to figure out
what you want.

with anger...

a lot of alcohol.

would be together forever.

for a minute?

32:44.755 --> 32:47.121

you need.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.760
There is nothing
in this video...

33:00.855 --> 33:03.187
that indicates
what kind of weapon
was used to kill the victim.

33:03.274 --> 33:06.562
Yeah. It’s true.
It doesn’t look
like anybody’s armed.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.735
Now, I was able to salvage
some of the audio track.

and separated the different

with footage of an American...

with an African-American
businesswoman.
Huh.

34:31.278 --> 34:35.066
So we put together
a range of weapons which
might fire ball bearings...

at a velocity congruent with
the damage done to the inside
of our victim’s skull.

a paintball gun,

and filled with dense

antes de/ amanecer,
te arrepentiras.

37:05.599 --> 37:08.386
You were trying
to buy video footage
Ursula had taken of you...

37:08.477 --> 37:10.433
illegally dumping toxic waste.

37:10.521 --> 37:12.603
She thought she had
real footage of a UFO,

37:12.689 --> 37:14.680
so unfortunately for you,
she didn’t give it up.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.479
I work for a major corporation...

37:21.573 --> 37:24.610
that’s just signed a billion-dollar
deal with the Mexicans.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.953
You think you can
extradite me?

37:27.037 --> 37:29.028
Take your best shot.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.539
[Car Alarm Chirps]

37:40.217 --> 37:42.674
[Brennan ]
Here comes something.
[Booth ] What’s it say?

37:42.761 --> 37:48.506
Okay, it says that lnnatron
contracts its waste disposal
to an independent contractor.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.724
Is it owned
by a shell company?
Mm-hmm.

37:50.853 --> 37:53.640
Norte Domésticas, yes.
Well, you know,
we’ll get DC. on it.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.437
But I’m gonna tell you
right now, I already know
who owns that shell company.

37:56.567 --> 37:57.932
Rachel Adams?
Yep.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.937
lnnatron pays
the shell company...

38:00.028 --> 38:02.064
hundreds of thousands of dollars
to get rid of the waste,

38:02.156 --> 38:05.023
and Rachel and her crew, they
just dump it in the desert,
and they pocket the money.

38:05.117 --> 38:09.326
Well, Ursula Lapine
thinks she’s photographing
extraterrestrial contact.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.369
They catch her.
She ends up dead.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.993
Well, why would she turn down
the money in the diner,

38:14.084 --> 38:16.040
then agree to meet
out in the desert?

38:16.128 --> 38:18.995
Perhaps that’s where they agreed
to swap the video for the money.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.171
lguess.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.876
Oh, you say “I guess,”
but you mean “I don’t think so.”

38:24.970 --> 38:26.881
Well, Rachel lives in Juarez.

38:26.972 --> 38:31.466
I mean, she could get herself
an untraceable gun, what,
in, like, 15 minutes?

38:31.560 --> 38:34.643
Instead she shows up
with a homemade zip gun?
That doesn’t make sense.

38:34.771 --> 38:35.977
[ Beeping ]
Right?

38:36.064 --> 38:38.350
[ Ringing]
[ Beeps]

38:38.442 --> 38:40.353
Hodgins.
[ Brennan ]
Hodgins.

38:40.444 --> 38:43.936
- Oh, hey. Dr. Brennan.
- No. Hodgins, it’s not me.
It’s Booth.

38:44.031 --> 38:46.898
Okay, listen.
Hodgins, could we just
focus on the ball bearings?

38:46.992 --> 38:49.358
- Yeah, what about them?
- Could you trace them
to lnnatron?

38:49.453 --> 38:51.990
- No.
- Well, how can
you be so sure?

38:52.080 --> 38:55.538
Because they’re obsolete.
They were manufactured
in the ’40s and the ’50s.

38:55.626 --> 38:59.710
- For what?
- Roller skates, fishing reels,
yo-yos, turntables.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.787
Toys?

39:06.970 --> 39:10.383
Hey, I’m just closing up.
I turned off the grill
about a half an hour ago.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.465
- Oh, we, uh—
- No, we’re not here
to eat, Blaine.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.595
Any of these work
back here?

39:14.686 --> 39:17.018
[Blaine ]
Yeah. The disruptor
from Gamma-Gamma Six.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.437
Why isn ’t this
solar system working ?

39:19.524 --> 39:22.106
’Cause it’s 60 years old.
What is with you people?

39:22.236 --> 39:25.319
Well, we, uh—
You overheard Rachel
offering Ursula payoff money.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.112
- Didn’t you, Blaine?
- What? No, ldidn’t.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.862
You told us you had
to ask them to keep it down.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.576
How come you don’t
interrupt Bones?
I’m a gentleman.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.617
How much did—
How much did Rachel offer?
Ten grand? Twenty?

39:36.708 --> 39:40.121
But Ursula thought
that she had proof
of alien life.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.203
Now, how much
did she ask for?
A million bucks ?

39:42.297 --> 39:44.413
Hey, you can’tjust
take stuff like that.
You need a warrant.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.625
- Oh, I’ll get a warrant.
- Oh, no, no, no.
We don’t need a warrant.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.007
We’re just playing.
Yeah, like the sign says.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.589
/ ﬁgure what happens
is you told Ursula
you could get her mil/ions.

39:53.684 --> 39:56.096
- You arranged—
- Yeah, you arranged
to meet out in the desert,

39:56.186 --> 39:57.892
told her to bring the video,
you’d bring the buyer.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.392
- He’s trying
to take your credit.
- He’s just being talkative.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.598
Can you hand me
those ball bearings there,
will you?

40:02.693 --> 40:06.982
- Look at that.
They seem to fit perfectly.
- Come on, that’s just a toy.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.155
You couldn’t hurt
a flea with that.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.233
[Brennan ] Oh!
[Booth ]
Oh!

40:13.453 --> 40:16.035
Yes, that would be
the murder weapon.

40:17.916 --> 40:22.034
Hey, hey, I-I got my rights.
You got the right
to shut the hell up, Blaine.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.502
[Handcuffs Ratchet]
Killing that poor,
crazy woman for her video.

40:24.589 --> 40:29.299
Yeah, by the way, that video,
it was hid down her throat
on a thread of dental ﬂoss.

40:29.386 --> 40:33.345
- You moron.
- He is a moron.
You are definitely a moron.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.469
Well, not literally.
Figuratively.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.849
It’s very satisfying to use
an insulting colloquialism
even when it isn’t accurate.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.225
Right. It’s even better
when they resist arrest
and you get to hit them.

40:43.317 --> 40:46.354
I don’t know.
Yeah, I think so.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.321
[Chattering, Laughing ]

40:52.534 --> 40:54.866
So, do you feel better?

40:54.995 --> 40:57.111
Being open about
our relationship?
Yeah.

40:57.247 --> 41:01.160
Yeah. You bet.
You know, it’s over
between Hodgins and me.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.207
I mean, you
believe that now, right?

41:03.295 --> 41:06.537
I think everything is always
more complicated than it looks.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.916
I am telling you, mister,
it’s not.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.712
Like Dr. Brennan says,

41:14.806 --> 41:18.390
“No use jumping to conclusions
before all the evidence is in.”

41:41.291 --> 41:41.916
[Booth ]
Quite a show, huh?

41:41.917 --> 41:43.248
[Booth ]
Quite a show, huh?

41:43.377 --> 41:45.868
But shouldn’t we
be going home?
Come on, Bones.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.214
How many times
do you get a chance
to check out a desert sky?

41:48.298 --> 41:50.289
Well, I’ve been
in the desert many times.

41:50.384 --> 41:55.504
Though usually I’m digging
in the ground, not looking up.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.679
Now’s your chance
to look up.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.633
So look up.
[ Laughing ]

42:00.727 --> 42:04.891
But it’s ridiculous to think
that there’s anything
on this planet worth seeing...

42:04.981 --> 42:09.645
which merits crossing
what are literally
astronomical distances.

42:11.696 --> 42:15.735
Maybe aliens
are anthropologists.

42:15.826 --> 42:20.786
Maybe they just wanna study
our religion and sex...

42:20.872 --> 42:25.992
and... love and
our funny languages
and line dancing?

42:26.086 --> 42:28.919
That’s an interesting possibility
I hadn’t considered.

42:29.005 --> 42:31.747
Well, living creatures,
they like to reach out, Bones.

42:31.842 --> 42:33.958
Living creatures
like to reach out
and eat each other.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.043
Oh, so what are
you saying?

42:36.138 --> 42:39.926
That the aliens just
wanna come down here
and drink our spinal fluid?

42:40.016 --> 42:44.976
Well, if the aliens
are advanced enough
to fly faster than light,

42:45.063 --> 42:47.850
then they can probably
make spinal fluid.

42:47.941 --> 42:49.897
Really? You just said
that aliens are nice.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.771
I did not.

42:51.862 --> 42:55.821
You just basically said
that aliens are nice
anthropologists.

42:55.949 --> 43:00.818
I don’t think so.
You think
that aliens are you.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.073
[ Chuckles ]
You got me.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.121
You know,
l-l’m one of them.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.790
I was sent down
as an advance scout.

43:07.878 --> 43:09.789
[Laughs]
I knew it.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.836
No probing.
No probing.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.790
Hey, probing is a valuable way
to gather information.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.214
We know how you people
like to probe. Right.
[ Laughing ]

43:18.346 --> 43:20.302
Did you hear that?

43:21.808 --> 43:23.844
[ Buzzing, Chirping Stops]

43:23.935 --> 43:25.550
