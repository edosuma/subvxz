WEBVTT

00:17.952 --> 00:19.284
Maggie:
<i>We've met before.</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:20.986
Dandy:
I don't think so.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.455
I never forget a pretty face.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.958
Your voice sounds so familiar,

00:25.960 --> 00:28.360
I can almost place it.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.463
Is that enough to start?
(laughs)

00:31.465 --> 00:33.966
For five dollars,
you can ask me anything.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.668
I've had a few recent...

00:36.670 --> 00:39.972
Misadventures
with the fairer sex.

00:39.974 --> 00:40.973
You're a heartbreaker.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.808
That's not hard to see.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.644
I've hurt someone badly.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.981
And the person
i always counted on for help...

00:48.983 --> 00:51.884
Can't help anymore.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.887
And you're afraid
this time you'll have to pay.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.703
Avon calling.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.505
Is the lady
of the house available?

01:13.507 --> 01:16.008
Do come in.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.043
Mother would love
to have some company.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.411
Oh...

01:22.917 --> 01:24.983
(quietly impressed):
Oh...!

01:27.721 --> 01:30.089
(dandy humming "if you're
happy and you know it")

01:47.041 --> 01:49.308
Now you're my puppet mother.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.079
Let's play a game.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.116
Mother, you be dot.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.953
Avon lady,
whose name i don't know,

02:00.955 --> 02:04.890
You get to play the part
of bette!

02:04.892 --> 02:07.926
(dandy laughing)

02:07.928 --> 02:09.928
Maggie:
<i>You can rest easy.</i>

02:09.930 --> 02:12.898
The ball is clear as day.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.468
Your indiscretion will
soon be forgotten.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.070
What about, uh,

02:18.072 --> 02:20.005
Trouble from my past?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.743
Oh, there is someone.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.279
A dark cloud on the horizon.

02:27.281 --> 02:30.749
There will be rain,
but... It'll pass.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.085
And you'll go on
just like before,

02:33.087 --> 02:34.586
Breaking hearts.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.121
I can't tell you

02:36.123 --> 02:38.657
What it means
to hear those words.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.759
(dandy laughs)

02:40.761 --> 02:43.162
You are my savior.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.237
A hundred thank-you's,
esmeralda.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.274
Please...

02:55.276 --> 02:57.876
Come back for a reading anytime.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.948
You have true talent.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.184
It would be a shame

03:05.186 --> 03:07.953
To waste the powers
inside of you.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.022
(anxious laugh)

03:27.374 --> 03:30.142
Ima, i've never seen
anybody like anything

03:30.144 --> 03:32.477
More than you
and a mouthful of food.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.813
(both laugh)

03:34.815 --> 03:38.317
I want to see it again.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.552
Oh, you're
too good to me, jimmy.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.022
You find the twins yet?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.792
I see you been doing
a lot of looking.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.230
I've been busy feeding ima.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.364
Eat up, baby.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.565
If you want it long and hard,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.567
I need you soft and wide.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.536
(both laugh)

03:57.538 --> 04:01.406
Jesus, jimmy,
you are stinking drunk.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.442
(whistling nearby)

04:09.350 --> 04:12.351
Jimmy (shouts drunkenly):
You...!

04:12.353 --> 04:15.020
What'd you do
with the twins?

04:15.022 --> 04:16.855
Last i saw, they were with you.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.223
But if you see bette and dot,

04:18.225 --> 04:19.424
I'd be happy
to take them back.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.525
No questions asked.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.560
I would never let them near you.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.228
I know exactly who you are.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.264
You were behind that mask.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.699
You were the other clown.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.201
Are you with this drunk?

04:29.203 --> 04:30.702
Hey, come on, jimmy.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.070
Let's stand to one side,
let this...

04:32.072 --> 04:34.373
No! No!

04:34.375 --> 04:36.041
You're a murderer.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.876
(groans)
there's nothing worse

04:37.878 --> 04:39.444
Than an alcoholic
with bad hygiene.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.246
Such a waste.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.382
I'm gonna put you away if
it's the last thing i do!

04:43.384 --> 04:47.386
God, you're pathetic.
(jimmy groans)

04:47.388 --> 04:50.422
And if you hadn't stolen
the twins from me,

04:50.424 --> 04:53.292
I would leave you
here in your filth.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.228
But you took away my
last chance at happiness.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.297
And for that,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.632
I must have revenge.

05:02.236 --> 05:05.237
I'm your god, jimmy.

05:05.239 --> 05:10.142
And i've decided
that you need to suffer.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.911
I'm going to destroy you

05:12.913 --> 05:15.247
And everything you love.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.648
Oh...

05:17.751 --> 05:20.819
It will be so much fun.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.108
(persistent knocking on door)
bette:
<i>What do we do?</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:52.911
Oh,<i> meine liebchen!</i>

06:52.913 --> 06:54.546
Thank goodness
we have found you.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.248
But look at this.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.352
Living like animals.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.420
But how wise of ethel

07:01.422 --> 07:03.255
To have hidden you away.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.357
Where is ethel?
What's going on?

07:05.359 --> 07:07.058
There's a mob out there
hunting freaks.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.261
Yes. More than a mob,
the entire town.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.063
These floridian rubes have
finally turned against us.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.432
No freak is safe.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.201
Ethel was the first to go.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.202
Ethel's dead?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.937
They tore her head off.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.073
Imagine what a crazy mob
would do

07:22.075 --> 07:24.075
With your two heads.
How did you find us?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.445
It wasn't difficult.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.712
I have my connections.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.713
Stanley:
<i>Are you sure she left a note?</i>

07:28.715 --> 07:29.748
Elsa:
<i>Yes! Why would</i>

07:29.750 --> 07:30.782
<i>She make up such a thing?</i>

07:30.784 --> 07:33.351
She was about
to plug me good.

07:34.388 --> 07:36.888
Ah, here!

07:36.890 --> 07:40.459
A motor hotel
in west palm beach.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.294
That's where
she stashed the twins.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.629
She instructs jimmy
to go find them.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.401
Stanley:<i> We have to get you</i>
<i>someplace safe.</i>

07:49.403 --> 07:51.470
But not back to the camp.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.404
No, no, no, no.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.406
But we have a place and a plan.

07:54.408 --> 07:57.309
I don't believe you. Why should
i trust anything you say?

07:57.311 --> 08:00.111
Because i have done
what you asked.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.647
The surgeon you wanted,
the one who separated

08:02.649 --> 08:03.815
The brodie twins...

08:03.817 --> 08:05.417
He is on his way down here.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.919
Your every wish is about

08:07.921 --> 08:09.488
To come true.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.930
Maggie: We already
looked over here.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.932
All we did was call out
"bette and dot"

08:20.934 --> 08:22.501
A couple of times.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.503
Well, hello.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.470
Maggie:
Who are you?

08:25.472 --> 08:27.606
What do you want?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.108
I came to see miss desiree.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.644
The most beautiful woman

08:32.646 --> 08:35.514
In the world.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.516
Well, you come back
at show time,

08:37.518 --> 08:38.850
Like everyone else.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.652
Uh, but we have a rendezvous...

08:40.654 --> 08:42.621
You better scram, pal.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.956
Or you'll have a rendezvous
with a black eye.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.292
I'm a big girl, maggie.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.361
Go on.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.564
Oh.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.866
Mmm.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.502
I'm sorry, but i
could not stay away.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.304
Mm-mm.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.540
You better get
ahold of yourself,

09:01.542 --> 09:05.043
Angus t. Jefferson.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.049
Maggie:
<i>Who was that?</i>

09:11.051 --> 09:13.985
My beau.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.488
And you say anything, you gonna
be the one with the black eye.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.057
(passionate moaning nearby)
i wouldn't dream of it.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.562
(both laugh)

09:27.501 --> 09:29.634
Ain't that a sight?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.370
Are you... Serious?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.506
Really?

09:34.508 --> 09:36.174
Shit!

09:36.176 --> 09:39.010
Goddamn it, i was
so close to a nut!

09:39.012 --> 09:40.579
(laughs)

09:40.581 --> 09:42.514
Well, let's leave the pigs
to their rutting.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.516
Shall we?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.351
Sure knows how
to ruin a party.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.521
Ima: Let her go, honey.
You got me now.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.222
He'll put it in anyone!

09:51.224 --> 09:52.524
He's drunk!

09:52.526 --> 09:54.025
Leave her out of this!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.026
She's nice.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.728
And soft.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.430
(scoffs)

09:58.432 --> 09:59.531
No, don't go, don't go!

09:59.533 --> 10:02.367
Don't touch me,
you asshole!

10:02.369 --> 10:05.036
She begs me to touch her!

10:05.038 --> 10:06.738
Look at these knockers!

10:06.740 --> 10:10.208
And i swear, she tastes
like a lemon-lime lollipop!

10:10.210 --> 10:12.744
You keep your mitts off him
or i'll jump on your ass

10:12.746 --> 10:14.779
And i'll flatten you
like a cracker!

10:14.781 --> 10:17.549
(scoffs)
you're nothing!

10:17.551 --> 10:19.618
You could be a pillow!
A donut!

10:19.620 --> 10:20.552
A sock!

10:20.554 --> 10:23.655
Jimmy...?

10:25.592 --> 10:27.926
(retching, vomiting)

10:27.928 --> 10:30.562
Myrna:
<i>You did?</i>

10:30.564 --> 10:32.897
My goodness!
What-what did it taste like?

10:32.899 --> 10:35.400
I don't know-- like skin, but

10:35.402 --> 10:36.635
Softer and saltier, i think.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.571
You are so liberal.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.640
Well, all i know

10:41.642 --> 10:43.775
Is that someone got
a new stove delivered

10:43.777 --> 10:46.478
From sears and roebuck
this afternoon.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.680
(all laugh)

10:50.083 --> 10:51.950
Are you okay?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.652
He's drunk.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.454
He kept... Missing.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.657
I just paid him and left.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.827
Who's next?

11:04.598 --> 11:05.764
Goddamn starving.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.633
Ethel:
You're disgusting.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.902
I'm rolling over in my grave.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.373
Ma?

11:17.611 --> 11:19.678
I gave birth to you,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.179
Squatting by an oak tree.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.781
Nearly killed me.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.282
The worrying,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.451
The sacrifices,
and all for what?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.520
I'm sorry, ma.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.124
Why'd you do that to yourself?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.627
Why didn't you come
to me for help?

11:35.629 --> 11:37.295
I didn't have
much time left anyway.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.464
No one was gonna preserve
ethel darling

11:39.466 --> 11:41.666
And keep her around
past her time.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.802
How did you store leftovers
in your day, ethel?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.404
Leftovers?

11:47.708 --> 11:48.640
Is that what these are for?

11:48.642 --> 11:51.309
Keeping old food fresh?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.011
I'm confused.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.012
I need you!

11:54.014 --> 11:56.715
When you protect the past,

11:56.717 --> 11:58.483
You lose the future.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.684
(muffled sobbing)

11:59.686 --> 12:02.053
You're wasting
your life grieving over me.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.523
You were supposed
to redeem our sorry line.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.825
(chuckles)

12:06.827 --> 12:08.059
To think,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.328
I wasted all my hopes
and dreams

12:10.330 --> 12:11.329
On another

12:11.331 --> 12:13.665
No-good drunk,

12:13.667 --> 12:15.500
(whispering):
Like his father.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.735
Elaine:
Oh, ethel,

12:16.737 --> 12:17.736
You're a delight.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.170
Jimmy (muffled):
I'm so sorry!

12:19.172 --> 12:21.906
I'm so sorry.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.746
I think you need to leave.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.089
(sighs)

12:38.091 --> 12:40.391
¶ what a wonderful holiday ¶

12:40.393 --> 12:42.861
¶ with bells on every sleigh ¶

12:42.863 --> 12:46.898
¶ and voices full
of happy cheer ¶

12:46.900 --> 12:48.600
(muttering)

12:48.602 --> 12:50.368
¶ bringing all the good luck
and health ¶

12:50.370 --> 12:52.704
(lock clicks)
¶ you'd ever wish yourself... ¶

12:52.706 --> 12:55.540
I am so sorry, ladies.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.375
(doorbell rings)
maybe we should eat.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.444
(knocking on door)

13:01.281 --> 13:02.781
Should we call the police?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.583
No.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.119
It's okay.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.721
Hello.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.222
Am i interrupting?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.892
(sighs)
my, that dress is
a magical color.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.727
What is that, periwinkle?

13:15.729 --> 13:17.796
Lana lobell calls it
"spanish sky."

13:17.798 --> 13:19.597
That's remarkable.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.965
(chuckles)
i'm sorry.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.734
My car just broke down.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.069
Would you mind if i came in
and borrowed your telephone

13:25.071 --> 13:26.571
To call the auto club?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.739
I'm happy to pay you
for the call.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.774
(chuckles)
nonsense. Come in.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.876
Thank you.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.602
Bette:
Dot, look.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.937
Our diaries.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.805
I have so missed my writing.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.607
I thought you would.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.942
So i brought some
of your things,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.343
And, well, some of mine,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.645
To make the place
seem more homey.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.948
How long do you expect us
to stay here?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.649
Oh, not for long.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.685
Just until the doctor arrives.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.687
Well, i don't understand.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.856
He's gonna operate on us here?

14:17.858 --> 14:20.825
Bette:
Oh, god.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.494
Oh, no, i can't.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.029
No!
Elsa:<i> I can't.</i>

14:25.031 --> 14:27.365
No. I took those girls in.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.868
I promised to protect them.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.804
And now what? Murder?

14:32.806 --> 14:34.472
I love my monsters.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.807
I truly do.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.308
No, of course you do.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.143
A heart as passionate
as yours,

14:39.145 --> 14:40.979
That gives so much on the stage,

14:40.981 --> 14:44.649
Cannot help but feel empathy
for god's cast-offs.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.817
In fact,

14:45.819 --> 14:47.485
I came
to the same conclusion myself.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.987
What conclusion?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.822
I realized you were right
all along.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.891
The best way to send
those girls off in style

14:52.893 --> 14:54.993
Is to give them
exactly what they want.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.729
So i made a few calls
to hollywood.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.530
To hollywood?
Yeah.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.066
I was, uh, chummy with
greer garson's dermatologist.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.068
She happens to be close
personal friends

15:04.070 --> 15:05.870
With a chicago doctor,

15:05.872 --> 15:07.705
This guy who separated
the twins.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.675
I called him up
on the telephone.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.010
You called him?
Yeah.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.411
If the twins are separated,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.079
They can be
no more trouble to you.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.016
It's a win-win-win.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.884
We go off to california.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.421
The girls can stay here to live
their two separate lives.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.861
Elsa:
<i>What's this table doing here?</i>

15:29.863 --> 15:31.429
This is for
the initial examination.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.731
The actual surgery will
take place in the hospital.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.733
Dr. Sugar is seeing to all
the arrangements now.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.035
It's all very...

15:37.037 --> 15:38.770
(whispering):
Hush-hush.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.940
Uh, you'll be transported there
under cover of night,

15:41.942 --> 15:43.241
Of course.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.876
How much is this gonna cost us?

15:44.878 --> 15:45.944
Not a penny.
Since he worked

15:45.946 --> 15:47.111
With the brodie twins,

15:47.113 --> 15:49.047
Dr. Sugar is fascinated
by your case.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.381
One of those twins died.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.084
That's true,
but dr. Sugar assured me

15:53.086 --> 15:56.955
That that casualty was due
to a very rare infection,

15:56.957 --> 15:59.757
And he's now perfected
his technique.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.459
So we both can live.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.895
Well, just imagine it, bette.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.898
You can go to the movies
any time you want.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.901
Sing along to the radio
and dance all night.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.903
With one leg.
I explained to dr. Sugar

16:11.905 --> 16:14.739
That you each had
your own heart and lungs.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.808
He said there's no reason

16:16.810 --> 16:18.977
Why you can't be split
down the middle.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.412
(gasps)
bette, enough!

16:21.414 --> 16:24.415
After all these years together,
i want my freedom.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.616
A chance at love

16:25.618 --> 16:27.318
Like a normal woman.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.987
How can you
not understand that?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.421
No.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.956
No, i won't.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.758
I won't do it.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.793
It's barbaric.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.596
Nonsense.
They'll anesthetize you girls,

16:38.598 --> 16:40.498
So you won't feel a thing.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.633
Elsa:
Your sister's right.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.635
You need your own lives.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.005
Stanley: I have to go
to the train station.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.008
Our good doctor should
be arriving any minute.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.781
(door bangs shut)

16:56.783 --> 16:58.516
Man:
<i>Honey, i thought we agreed</i>

16:58.518 --> 17:00.785
To these parties if your friends
don't block the driveway

17:00.787 --> 17:01.986
With their cars.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.122
(record scratches, skips)

17:04.124 --> 17:06.624
I had to park halfway down
the street, for christ's sake.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.060
Sylvia?

17:11.131 --> 17:13.197
(record scratches, skips)

17:15.168 --> 17:18.102
(water sloshing gently)

17:29.015 --> 17:30.314
(screaming)

17:30.316 --> 17:33.051
(scream continues, muffled)

17:35.989 --> 17:37.155
(dandy humming a waltz)

17:37.157 --> 17:39.223
(squishing, sloshing)

17:51.171 --> 17:53.004
Regina!

17:53.006 --> 17:55.073
I knew you'd come back.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.008
I've been to the cops, dandy.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.844
I've asked them for help
in finding my mother.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.346
Regina...

18:02.348 --> 18:03.915
I killed your mother.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.983
(gasps)

18:09.189 --> 18:11.089
(panting)

18:11.091 --> 18:13.391
Is...

18:13.393 --> 18:14.859
Is...

18:14.861 --> 18:16.694
Is this hers?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.029
Is this my mother's blood?

18:18.031 --> 18:20.431
Oh, no, no, no.
We buried her weeks ago.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.033
Mother and i.

18:22.035 --> 18:24.202
Recently, i killed her as well,

18:24.204 --> 18:28.139
And that's when i discovered
the power of bathing in blood.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.077
This is fresh blood
from some lovely ladies

18:33.079 --> 18:34.946
I killed earlier today.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.115
(whimpers)

18:37.117 --> 18:39.117
Pay attention, regina!

18:42.055 --> 18:44.555
I cannot begin to tell you

18:44.557 --> 18:46.757
How it felt.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.560
The kind of control

18:49.562 --> 18:51.629
Over their lives.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.064
Their trust,

18:53.066 --> 18:55.066
Their fear,

18:55.068 --> 18:57.468
Their pain, their confusion.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.071
I believe i am living
my destiny.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.773
(chuckles)

19:02.775 --> 19:04.575
I'm finally happy.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.644
Regina?

19:09.082 --> 19:11.149
Well, good for you.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.485
They're not.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.753
My mother isn't.

19:15.755 --> 19:19.090
Take a bath with me, regina.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.759
Like when we were little.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.128
I have so many questions
for you.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.931
Like, when did you know?

19:26.933 --> 19:30.101
You must have had a sense,
at least,

19:30.103 --> 19:32.937
That i was destined to be...

19:32.939 --> 19:35.006
This.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.113
I am a god.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.949
A god who has chosen

19:44.951 --> 19:47.485
To walk among men.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.620
I have no interest
in killing you.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.190
You are the only one
in this house worth a damn.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.126
Stop acting
so scared of me!

19:55.128 --> 19:57.128
Get in the tub!

19:57.130 --> 19:59.997
I want to go.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.532
I want to leave now.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.901
I decide when you leave here.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.006
(scoffs)

20:09.008 --> 20:11.375
I thought you were
my special family.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.644
But you are just

20:13.646 --> 20:16.180
A hideous, predictable

20:16.182 --> 20:18.649
Bore.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.319
It's going to be lonely.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.054
I should've anticipated that.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.556
(screams)

20:25.558 --> 20:26.824
I'll get used to it.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.192
Get out.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.061
Go!

20:30.063 --> 20:31.662
Before i decide
to kill you, too!

20:31.664 --> 20:32.730
(shrieks)

20:34.167 --> 20:36.167
I'm above the law!

20:36.169 --> 20:37.868
Beyond the law!

20:37.870 --> 20:41.239
I am the law!

20:56.356 --> 20:58.122
You mad at me?

20:59.359 --> 21:01.192
I'm not dim, you know.

21:01.194 --> 21:02.860
Everyone thinks
you're the smart one,

21:02.862 --> 21:04.195
'cause you're so practical,

21:04.197 --> 21:05.763
But i pay attention.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.967
I know they can't
separate us fully.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.205
One of us can survive
that surgery, not both.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.906
That's not true.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.276
They've learned so much
from the brodie case.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.211
Oh, please, dot.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.580
Please stop lying to me.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.250
I am so tired of this life
of ours, bette.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.451
This infinite,

21:27.453 --> 21:30.288
Intolerable arranged marriage.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.524
Aren't you tired of it?

21:35.261 --> 21:37.261
And i don't want you dead.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.330
I don't.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.301
I just never dreamed
it might be possible

21:43.303 --> 21:46.237
For one of us to live
a normal life.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.440
Mother refused to buy us
lace-up shoes

21:49.442 --> 21:52.310
'cause she insisted we would
never be able to tie them.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.413
But we spent hours
working it out

21:55.415 --> 21:57.815
Till we finally cracked it.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.650
Same with needlepoint.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.920
There was nothing
we could not work through

22:02.922 --> 22:04.755
When we put our heads together.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.758
No one can
understand our burden.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.294
You and i have endured a life

22:10.296 --> 22:12.330
That would've driven
most people mad,

22:12.332 --> 22:16.267
But to me,
it's been a gift, really.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.269
We've been given
the opportunity

22:18.271 --> 22:22.340
To really love
another person.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.509
To love them as
you love yourself.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.112
And love...

22:28.114 --> 22:31.115
Is about sacrifice.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.183
It's answering the question

22:32.185 --> 22:34.352
How much would you give

22:34.354 --> 22:36.287
For the health and happiness

22:36.289 --> 22:38.356
Of the one you love?

22:46.332 --> 22:50.368
I have the same
longings as you.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.170
Same dreams of a normal life.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.039
You could never
survive without me.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.510
I know.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.579
I would like
to think i could.

23:04.317 --> 23:07.451
But i don't think i could
actually stand being alone.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.324
And we're not bad people.

23:13.326 --> 23:16.227
We're good people,
good girls,

23:16.229 --> 23:18.028
And we've seen
so much suffering.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.398
We deserve a chance.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.834
And i know now

23:23.836 --> 23:26.504
That neither of us
can have that

23:26.506 --> 23:28.406
If we stay like this.

23:30.209 --> 23:34.011
I would rather, one of us,
truly live...

23:34.013 --> 23:36.347
Than both of us
withering away together.

23:36.349 --> 23:37.848
What are you saying?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.350
Just that any man

23:39.352 --> 23:41.252
Would be lucky to have you.

23:43.356 --> 23:46.390
And the tattler sisters
will not be defeated.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.359
(sobs quietly)

23:48.361 --> 23:50.327
And if it comes to it...

23:52.765 --> 23:56.233
...If they had to make a choice,
during surgery,

23:56.235 --> 23:57.935
That only
one of us would live...

24:00.373 --> 24:03.140
...I want to give my life
to you, sister.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.243
I want to give

24:06.245 --> 24:09.013
My life so you can have one.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.822
(sniffling)

24:20.393 --> 24:22.593
I love you, bette.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.662
I love you, dot.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.484
<i>(pen scratching)</i>

25:04.470 --> 25:05.536
(pen scratching)

25:09.842 --> 25:11.509
(grunts)

25:31.964 --> 25:34.532
(engine idling)

25:45.511 --> 25:46.744
Going someplace?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.713
(slurring):
It's none of your business.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.916
(chuckling):
Oh... Oh, you're wrong.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.954
Everything you do from
here on out is my business.

25:59.492 --> 26:00.991
You weren't thinking
of heading back

26:00.993 --> 26:03.160
To the, uh,
high noon, were you?

26:03.162 --> 26:06.063
Word is that pretty
little hustler of yours...

26:06.065 --> 26:07.498
He ain't coming back.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
Some-something's happened
to andrew?

26:09.502 --> 26:11.001
You know that for a fact?

26:11.003 --> 26:12.169
Forget about andy.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.371
He's just gone.

26:14.373 --> 26:17.508
He forgot about you
a long time ago.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.343
(grunts)

26:19.345 --> 26:22.012
So pull
yourself together.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.615
You're acting like a man
who's guilty of something.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.885
Yeah, that's better.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.020
(chuckling)

26:30.022 --> 26:33.424
Can't have you
going around half-cocked.

26:34.527 --> 26:37.528
Me...

26:37.530 --> 26:39.630
I'm never half-cocked.

26:43.536 --> 26:44.535
Oh...

26:44.537 --> 26:47.237
Holy shit.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.039
See? See?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.608
You forgot
about andy already.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.543
Why, you're...

26:52.545 --> 26:53.777
You're a freak.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.313
You should see it
when it's angry.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.218
Want to touch it?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.219
(moans quietly)

27:02.221 --> 27:03.721
You're disgusting.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.256
No, no... If that's
what you want...

27:06.258 --> 27:07.257
(grunts)

27:07.259 --> 27:08.258
Go on...

27:08.260 --> 27:10.561
(grunts)

27:10.563 --> 27:12.563
It'll be our s...
Your secret shame.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.398
It'll be my secret shame.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.566
(breath trembling)

27:15.568 --> 27:17.568
It's fun...

27:17.570 --> 27:19.637
To have secrets...

27:21.240 --> 27:23.307
...Isn't it, dell?

27:42.628 --> 27:45.262
Sign it.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.697
(startled shout)

28:10.456 --> 28:12.723
¶ ¶

28:21.634 --> 28:23.600
(rope creaking)

28:25.304 --> 28:27.137
(sobs)

28:27.139 --> 28:28.906
Some strong man.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.943
Ethel...?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.314
You come here
to talk me out of it.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.716
You can't.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.683
I made up my mind.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.684
(ethel scoffs)

28:40.686 --> 28:42.553
Talk you out of it?

28:42.555 --> 28:43.821
Hell, i'm here to watch.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.056
Go on, do it.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.624
Coward.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.728
I am a coward.

28:52.364 --> 28:55.132
Just can't take
the shame of it no more...

28:56.335 --> 28:58.702
Being...

28:58.704 --> 29:00.404
(voice breaking):
What i am.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.742
A freak.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.246
As it turns out, yeah.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.750
I swear to christ, ethel,

29:12.752 --> 29:14.852
I don't know how you
and the others manage it.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.855
We manage it
because we have to.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.690
We wear our shame
on the outside.

29:19.692 --> 29:21.191
There's no hiding it.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.694
It's just who we are.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.763
Now, you...

29:25.765 --> 29:28.098
You carry your shame
on the inside.

29:28.100 --> 29:32.069
You keep it
trapped in there.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.071
It eats away at you,

29:34.073 --> 29:36.907
Feeding on you
like a living thing,

29:36.909 --> 29:42.279
Till there's nothing
left but the rot.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.415
I've been fighting it
for so long.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.719
I just don't have
any fight left in me.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.888
You never were
strong, dell,

29:50.890 --> 29:52.723
No matter how much
weight you could lift,

29:52.725 --> 29:57.094
Or how many steel bars
you could bend.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.730
You always been weak.

29:59.732 --> 30:02.633
Step up on that chair.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.902
This ain't
gonna take much.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.504
You're gonna let the weight
of your body do the work.

30:09.742 --> 30:13.811
Step up to that rope
and get it done.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.008
(chair creaking)

31:05.798 --> 31:07.664
(grunts)

31:07.666 --> 31:09.867
(gagging)

31:13.706 --> 31:16.540
(heart beating rapidly)

31:18.844 --> 31:20.444
(heartbeat slowing)

31:21.814 --> 31:23.046
(gags)

31:31.657 --> 31:32.723
(rope snaps)

31:34.827 --> 31:37.327
(wheezing, coughing)

31:37.329 --> 31:39.796
(heart beating steadily)

31:44.236 --> 31:47.504
(crying):
Oh, dell...

31:47.506 --> 31:48.505
Oh...

31:48.507 --> 31:50.540
(weakly):
I'm sorry.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.809
I'm so sorry...

32:00.853 --> 32:02.853
Hello, doctor.

32:02.855 --> 32:04.087
(chuckles)

32:05.257 --> 32:07.858
Ah, not yet, not yet.

32:07.860 --> 32:10.093
Pleasure comes first
from anticipation.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.095
Deh, deh, deh...
(inhales)

32:13.699 --> 32:16.033
All right, let's run
through this again.

32:16.035 --> 32:20.771
Dr. Sugar, tell me the names
of your most famous patients.

32:21.874 --> 32:24.942
Um...

32:24.944 --> 32:26.276
Shit, i forgot.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.546
Brodie. Okay.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.949
I wrote it in the first line
of the first page:

32:31.951 --> 32:34.384
Two boys, one name, brodie.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.286
Okay, just... Let's just,
let's keep this simple.

32:36.288 --> 32:41.391
There's only one line
you really have to land.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.895
We've learned a lot since
the... Brady case--

32:44.897 --> 32:47.064
Brodie.
Brodie case...

32:47.066 --> 32:50.267
And i feel confident
that the separation

32:50.269 --> 32:52.102
Will be a success
for the both of you.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.103
(clicks tongue)

32:53.105 --> 32:54.571
Wait...

32:54.573 --> 32:56.139
I don't really have
to cut them, do i?

32:56.141 --> 32:58.775
No! No one's going
to be cutting into anyone.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.944
We're just going to be
putting them to sleep.

33:00.946 --> 33:03.413
It's called euthanasia.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.815
Trust me, they'll
drift off peacefully.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.616
It's like putting down
a sad puppy

33:06.618 --> 33:07.951
Who's been hit by a car.

33:07.953 --> 33:08.919
We're doing these girls
a kindness.

33:08.921 --> 33:11.154
But i like puppies.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.423
Of course you do,
you sweet, innocent boy.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.827
Now, get over here
and suck my cock.

33:18.630 --> 33:22.165
Oh... Oh, oh, oh, oh...

33:23.936 --> 33:25.869
Ah...

33:27.639 --> 33:29.039
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

33:32.811 --> 33:35.345
Regina.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.947
You brought a guest.

33:36.949 --> 33:38.615
This is the police, dandy.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.117
I've told them everything

33:40.119 --> 33:41.952
And now
you're gonna pay.

33:41.954 --> 33:43.787
Detective colquitt,
jupiter pd.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.122
Mr. Mott,
this young lady

33:45.124 --> 33:46.790
Has made some
serious accusations.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.291
You mind answering
some questions?

33:48.293 --> 33:49.860
Come in.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.062
I have nothing to hide.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.033
My mother taught me
the importance of decorum.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.801
Offering an aperitif

33:57.803 --> 33:59.970
Is the first duty

33:59.972 --> 34:02.873
Of a gracious host.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.810
Colquitt:
And where is your mother?

34:06.812 --> 34:09.012
You killed her, and you
killed my mother, too.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.981
We can put all this to rest,
sir, if your mother

34:10.983 --> 34:13.316
Would just come down and
show us she's alive and well.

34:13.318 --> 34:14.651
Regina:
I already told you,

34:14.653 --> 34:15.652
They're dead.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.387
Just let the man talk.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.889
Believe it or not,

34:18.891 --> 34:20.557
Regina and i grew up together.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.993
We were childhood
best friends,

34:22.995 --> 34:24.694
Inseparable,

34:24.696 --> 34:26.229
Until the summer i turned nine

34:26.231 --> 34:28.698
And became aware of the
difference in our stations.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.001
But even though
we've grown apart,

34:31.003 --> 34:33.270
I've never known regina to lie.

34:35.007 --> 34:38.341
So... If she says i killed them,

34:38.343 --> 34:40.844
Then they must be dead.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.012
Regina:
I told you.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.213
He's a maniac.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.015
Who knows how many
people he's killed?

34:45.017 --> 34:47.017
You're gonna fry for
your crimes, dandy.

34:47.019 --> 34:49.886
But what she didn't tell you,
detective colquitt,

34:49.888 --> 34:52.022
Is the absolute conviction

34:52.024 --> 34:54.691
That i'm going
to get away with it.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.860
The mott family owns
the biggest brands

34:56.862 --> 34:58.929
Of frozen foods
across america.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.864
You'd be surprised
how much money can be made

35:00.866 --> 35:03.366
One block of spinach at a time.

35:03.368 --> 35:06.269
So, including this estate

35:06.271 --> 35:08.705
And the house in montauk

35:08.707 --> 35:12.375
And the stocks and bonds held
in trust from my grandfather,

35:12.377 --> 35:14.244
The fortune left to me

35:14.246 --> 35:16.913
Could easily sustain
a small country.

35:16.915 --> 35:20.217
But more importantly,

35:20.219 --> 35:22.786
I've been imbued with the light.

35:23.956 --> 35:28.058
I have seen
the face of god,

35:28.060 --> 35:29.559
And he is looking at me

35:29.561 --> 35:32.129
From the mirror.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.735
I can think of nothing
that can stop me now.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.738
You should stop talking, sir.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.640
You're digging yourself a hole.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.142
I have a better idea.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.577
You dig a hole.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.246
For her.

35:49.248 --> 35:54.151
You work for me, and i will
pay you $1 million.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.719
Cash.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.991
You got a shovel?

36:15.941 --> 36:18.008
Jimmy:
What are you doing?

36:19.011 --> 36:21.178
Did elsa put you
up to this?

36:21.180 --> 36:24.514
Put it back!

36:24.516 --> 36:26.082
Where it was!

36:27.119 --> 36:28.351
I said put it back!

36:28.353 --> 36:29.953
Jimmy...

36:29.955 --> 36:31.288
I'll do it myself.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.956
Jimmy...

36:32.958 --> 36:34.391
Leave me alone!

36:36.128 --> 36:38.395
No...

36:43.035 --> 36:44.201
(grunts)

37:10.729 --> 37:13.597
What are you
doing here?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.067
Where you been?

37:17.069 --> 37:19.002
We were about to do
something horrible.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.670
Not we.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.372
Me. I was.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.207
I thought i knew
what was best.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.609
But i was wrong.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.178
I thought
the only way

37:28.180 --> 37:31.181
I could be happy...

37:31.183 --> 37:33.183
The only way
i could feel whole...

37:33.185 --> 37:35.752
Was to be separated
from my sister.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.923
I thought bette
was the problem.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.694
But she wasn't.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.296
It was me.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.035
My sweet...

37:52.037 --> 37:55.372
Sweet sister is
the purest part of my soul.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.208
We're a family.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.277
We belong together

38:00.279 --> 38:02.078
And i know that now.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.215
Well...

38:05.217 --> 38:07.284
Even family leaves.

38:09.221 --> 38:10.987
Nothing stays.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.405
I was so terribly sorry

38:28.407 --> 38:30.473
To hear about your mother.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.411
You're in such pain.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.247
I can feel it.

38:37.249 --> 38:39.349
But you're not alone.

38:40.485 --> 38:44.087
And you never have
to be alone again.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.489
What do you mean?

38:57.135 --> 38:59.269
Jimmy darling...

38:59.271 --> 39:01.604
I have loved you

39:01.606 --> 39:03.707
Since the first moment
i set eyes on you.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.776
You were warm

39:06.778 --> 39:09.946
And you were kind.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.281
And you looked right at me.

39:11.283 --> 39:13.316
You didn't flinch,

39:13.318 --> 39:15.285
Not even a bit.

39:15.287 --> 39:18.321
And in that moment,

39:18.323 --> 39:21.191
I felt i could face anything

39:21.193 --> 39:22.726
With you by my side.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.139
You are the only man for me.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.774
'cause you're like us.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.310
Different...

39:40.312 --> 39:42.579
But special.

39:45.650 --> 39:49.319
Let me take your pain away.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.388
Replace it with love.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.392
Dot...

39:57.396 --> 39:58.895
I don't know
what to say.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.199
Bette...

40:03.201 --> 40:06.236
Uh, how do you feel
about all this?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.407
I support dot.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.409
And dot wants you.

40:12.411 --> 40:14.344
Well...

40:14.346 --> 40:16.579
Well, it's your body, too.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.847
I can give you privacy.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.682
(laughs gently)
close my eyes

40:19.684 --> 40:22.352
And disappear
for a while.

40:22.354 --> 40:25.255
We could make you
so happy, jimmy.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.057
Not many men can boast

40:28.059 --> 40:31.094
Of a blonde and
a brunette for a wife.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.616
(gasps)

40:56.221 --> 40:57.787
Well, didn't you like it?

40:57.789 --> 41:00.590
Two souls, two mouths,

41:00.592 --> 41:02.892
Devoted only to you.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.462
To pleasing you.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.630
It could be that way always.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.305
I care about you.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.476
Both of you.

41:21.746 --> 41:24.314
But i can't.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.726
(sniffling)

41:39.464 --> 41:40.663
The truth is...

41:42.434 --> 41:45.201
...I'm in love
with someone else.

41:54.479 --> 41:57.080
She's a very lucky girl.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.587
We have to go.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.217
(crying quietly)

42:38.657 --> 42:40.723
(yells, bottle smashes)

42:42.694 --> 42:43.993
(sobs)

42:43.995 --> 42:46.462
(sirens approaching)

42:53.338 --> 42:54.737
Jimmy:
What the hell do you want?

42:54.739 --> 42:56.673
Jimmy darling,
you're under arrest...

42:56.675 --> 42:57.574
What?!

42:57.576 --> 42:58.841
...For the murders
of sylvia mills,

42:58.843 --> 43:00.176
Myrna austen,

43:00.178 --> 43:01.678
Joanne miller,

43:01.680 --> 43:03.413
And elaine seymour.
Wait, what?!

43:03.415 --> 43:04.681
Wait, i don't even know
those ladies.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.015
We have evidence.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.183
You left your glove

43:07.185 --> 43:09.352
At the crime scene,
lobster boy.

43:09.354 --> 43:10.553
What kind of sicko

43:10.555 --> 43:11.888
Goes after a bunch
of sweet housewives

43:11.890 --> 43:13.756
Just looking to buy
some tupperware?

43:13.758 --> 43:15.525
Wait, wait, wait,
you got it all wrong.

43:15.527 --> 43:16.759
I didn't...
I didn't do anything!

43:16.761 --> 43:18.361
No, he has been here
all day with me!

43:18.363 --> 43:19.362
You need to
back up.
This has to be...

43:19.364 --> 43:20.863
Back up!
(screams)
hey!

43:20.865 --> 43:22.699
Jimmy:
Do not touch her!
Where?

43:22.701 --> 43:24.567
You can't take him!
He didn't do anything!

43:24.569 --> 43:26.402
Jimmy:
I didn't do anything! Come on!

43:26.404 --> 43:27.403
(engine starts)

43:27.405 --> 43:29.405
Jimmy:
Maggie!

43:29.407 --> 43:32.375
Maggie!
(yells angrily)

43:32.377 --> 43:34.777
I didn't do nothing!

43:41.620 --> 43:45.622
