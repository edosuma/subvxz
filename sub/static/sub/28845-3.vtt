WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:06.959
In my old life,
I was a professional-surfer-turned-thief

00:06.960 --> 00:08.619
with a soon-to-be ex-husband
who is FBI.

00:08.620 --> 00:09.829
I need your help.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.630
The last time you said that,
killed my career.

00:11.654 --> 00:13.539
No, marrying me
while you were undercover

00:13.540 --> 00:14.669
killed your career.

00:14.670 --> 00:15.829
But now I'm back...

00:15.830 --> 00:17.030
Your boyfriend's a cop, right?

00:17.054 --> 00:18.919
Wyatt is not my boyfriend.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.330
We are friends with benefits.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.329
And it looks like
I may stay awhile.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.250
The Governor would like
to put you on a retainer.

00:26.251 --> 00:27.001
Some problems, you need...

00:27.002 --> 00:28.289
A fixer?

00:28.290 --> 00:30.120
Works for me.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.879
Whoo!

00:39.880 --> 00:41.539
You got no chance, Denisa!

00:41.540 --> 00:42.670
Whoo!

00:46.170 --> 00:47.170
Give me a break.

00:47.171 --> 00:48.209
You're too fast.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.670
Slowpoke!

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.710 --> 01:06.579
Yo, check this out.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.329
What is it?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.999
It's from a wreck or something.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.539
Looks like it was
a pretty big plane.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.380
Hang on. I'm coming down.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.879
Whoa.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.250
Hey, come here.

01:45.580 --> 01:46.959
Hey, Petra.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.459
We heard you were crashing here.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.459
Not by choice.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.079
Kind of got my arm twisted.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.959
It's a long story.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.419
Your dad was
in Shorepound, right?

01:55.420 --> 01:56.669
Yeah.

01:56.670 --> 01:57.709
Told you.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.030
We thought you might
know someone.

01:59.054 --> 02:00.459
Yeah, I know a lot of people.

02:00.460 --> 02:01.580
What for?

02:08.710 --> 02:09.878
Is this real?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.379
That, or somebody buried
fake gold in the jungle.

02:12.380 --> 02:13.919
And you want me
to help you sell it?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.830
Can you?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.420
What's my cut?

02:43.250 --> 02:44.329
Hello, Doug.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.669
Freedom agrees with you.

02:45.670 --> 02:46.959
Always has.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.119
Why am I here?

02:48.120 --> 02:51.289
Just digging the moment...

02:51.290 --> 02:54.289
You coming back to see me,
face to face.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.879
Let's cut to the chase.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.999
What do you want?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.579
You used to like
a little foreplay.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.959
You used to not try to kill me.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
Every relationship
has its ups and downs.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.209
Okay. I don't have to play
your games anymore.

03:07.210 --> 03:08.249
Bye, Doug.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.169
Love and kisses to
the boys in D block.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.789
Jasper needs help.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.789
Things aren't so rosy in Oregon.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.879
He ain't doing good time
in Greenbriar...

03:15.880 --> 03:18.039
Beefing and bitching
and knocking heads,

03:18.040 --> 03:19.749
getting his skinny ass
thrown in the hole.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.959
Well, you should've
thought about that

03:20.960 --> 03:22.400
before you dragged him
into your gang

03:22.424 --> 03:23.789
and got him tried as an adult.

03:23.790 --> 03:27.669
My nephew needs to learn
how to survive inside.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.169
And I'm the only family
he's got.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.370
Yeah, well, send him a letter.

03:30.394 --> 03:32.709
Share your hard-earned wisdom.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.209
Seems we got ourselves

03:34.210 --> 03:35.749
some seriously
overcrowded conditions

03:35.750 --> 03:37.459
in an outmoded facility here.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.669
Federal judge wants to ship
a bunch of us stateside.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.169
Guess where. Greenbriar.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.919
I hear you're
some kind of fancy fixer

03:42.920 --> 03:44.119
for the Governor now.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.499
Doing for him
like you used to do for me.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.669
But having a lot less fun.

03:48.670 --> 03:50.459
No. You know what?

03:50.460 --> 03:52.079
I'm not gonna do this with you.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.329
Come on, Cat.

03:53.330 --> 03:56.039
You always
had a soft spot for the kid.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.959
Bought him ice cream,
taught him how to surf.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.329
I don't get on
the list to Oregon,

04:00.330 --> 04:02.829
Jasper ain't gonna make it.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.289
Get me on that list.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.330
I got to get to Greenbriar.

04:10.790 --> 04:11.999
I need your help

04:12.000 --> 04:14.079
to get Doug O'Casey
transferred stateside.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.459
Why would you even consider

04:15.460 --> 04:16.999
doing O'Casey a favor?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.459
It's not for Doug O'Casey.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.918
It's for his nephew, Jasper.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.999
You believe he's telling
the truth about his nephew?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.379
I don't know.

04:24.380 --> 04:27.119
But I do know Doug's
not a man to be ignored.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.209
And Jasper is a sweet kid

04:29.210 --> 04:31.539
who got pushed
into the family business

04:31.540 --> 04:33.499
by Doug and Doug's brother...

04:33.500 --> 04:35.669
Something I'll never understand.

04:35.670 --> 04:38.000
Is this Jasper kid
clouding your judgment maybe?

04:40.460 --> 04:42.379
I'll talk to the Governor
and the Warden,

04:42.380 --> 04:44.379
see if Doug is even
eligible for transfer.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.829
Great, thanks.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.170
Don't thank me yet.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.419
Let me deal with this guy, okay?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.420
He's a ripoff artist,
but he knew my dad.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.330
Hey, Frank! Open up!

05:05.830 --> 05:07.419
You weren't lying.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.619
You thought I was? Yeah.

05:09.620 --> 05:10.670
Wouldn't you?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.499
So, where'd you teenage
desperadoes steal this?

05:15.500 --> 05:16.780
We didn't steal it. We found it.

05:16.781 --> 05:18.341
Look, we just want
to know two things...

05:18.365 --> 05:19.884
Is it real and
how much is it worth?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.079
Freeze!

05:23.080 --> 05:24.210
Don't move!

05:26.710 --> 05:27.749
Frank, no!

05:27.750 --> 05:29.579
Go, go, go! Go!

05:29.580 --> 05:30.879
Aah!

05:30.880 --> 05:32.000
Drop it!

05:33.170 --> 05:34.750
Run! Run!

05:52.420 --> 05:53.579
I need your help.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.999
Well, that's a coincidence

05:55.000 --> 05:56.539
'cause I need yours.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.340
Do you remember
Doug O'Casey's nephew, Jasper?

05:58.364 --> 05:59.829
What? Why?

05:59.830 --> 06:02.169
Well, I just remember you had
a crush on him way back when.

06:02.170 --> 06:03.669
For like two seconds
when I was a kid.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.510
I'm not, like,
his prison groupie or something.

06:05.511 --> 06:07.470
Okay, I was just wondering
if you'd talked to him

06:07.471 --> 06:09.499
or seen him
or been in contact with him.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.500
Look, seriously, some people
I know are in trouble.

06:11.524 --> 06:13.419
I need your connections.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.579
What connections?

06:14.580 --> 06:15.749
I don't know.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.209
Big-shot connections.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.490
Get-out-of-jail type
connections.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.620
Where did you get this?

06:25.290 --> 06:27.169
Okay, either you start talking

06:27.170 --> 06:29.169
or you can find
another boathouse to crash in,

06:29.170 --> 06:30.459
and I'll go back
to my real life.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.329
The jungle. The jungle.

06:32.330 --> 06:33.499
Around Tiger's Eye.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.220
I took them to Frank Shih's
to check it out.

06:35.244 --> 06:36.119
Frank Shih?

06:36.120 --> 06:37.959
These two guys come in shooting.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.209
T-There was... We're lucky
Pet knew about the back door.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.039
You're doing business
with Frank Shih?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.460
No, I knew him from my dad.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.000
Did... Did Frank get shot?

06:48.501 --> 06:50.821
No, there... there was all this
smoke, and we were running.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.305
How much trouble are we in?

06:56.330 --> 06:57.709
Frank Shih's dead.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.999
If they were armed or pulled
any kind of bonehead move,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.240
there's really nothing I can do

07:01.264 --> 07:03.419
but recommend them
a good lawyer.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.380
Wait, do you know
where they are?

07:04.381 --> 07:06.169
No, I do not know
where they are.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.119
I'm starting to figure out
when you're lying.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.119
Anyway, it's not my case.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.459
Hines and Inoue caught it.

07:12.460 --> 07:15.169
Want to introduce me to them?
Not really.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.499
They already
give me the side-eye

07:16.500 --> 07:18.420
for being the brother
of the Lieutenant Governor.

07:18.444 --> 07:21.379
What? And you think that I,
your trouble-making hookup

07:21.380 --> 07:22.959
would be another black mark
against you?

07:22.960 --> 07:26.459
Well, holding you against me
sounds nice.

07:26.460 --> 07:27.829
No.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.919
I got to go meet
some police officers.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.670
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

07:33.170 --> 07:36.039
Why the hell does the Governor's
office care about this anyway?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.459
Well, come on, you know...

07:37.460 --> 07:40.169
"Couple Feral Youths Execute
a Downtown Businessman"

07:40.170 --> 07:41.749
is definitely not
a good headline

07:41.750 --> 07:43.119
for our tourist-based economy.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.209
It's not our problem.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.079
We work our cases the right way.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.789
Let the chips fall
where they may.

07:47.790 --> 07:49.999
Right. Right.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.960
Well, I'm just saying, you know,

07:50.961 --> 07:52.379
I knew Frank Shih.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.169
Not a bad guy for a criminal.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.539
Maybe I can help you guys.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.879
This is from across the street.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.119
Solid IDs on two of the three...

08:00.120 --> 08:02.579
Finn Webb and Denisa Taylor.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.329
With a third unidentified
person in a baseball cap.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.709
You want to help us with that?

08:06.710 --> 08:08.169
Tell me something.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.709
Do you really believe a couple
of kids shot Frank Shih?

08:10.710 --> 08:13.669
They're both in the system...
Shoplifting, DUI...

08:13.670 --> 08:15.630
Yeah, that's how Bonnie
and Clyde got their start.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.170
You know Petra Torrance?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.579
Webb and Taylor are both
South Shore surf punks.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.669
So is she.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.749
Could be Perp 3.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.579
You know, this was incredible.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.379
You guys are everything
I hoped for and more.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.860
I think we should be
Facebook friends.

08:30.884 --> 08:32.249
I really do.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.330
Check it out.

08:40.169 --> 08:41.919
Bring those divorce papers?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.708
No.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.329
Remind me to talk to my lawyer
about that.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.919
Hey, talk to your lawyer
about that.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.039
You hungry?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.919
No. No, I'm not hungry.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.249
What... What is that?

08:52.250 --> 08:54.079
This...

08:54.080 --> 08:56.380
is my yearly eval
from the Bureau.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.829
Screw 'em. It's not like I care.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.669
Yeah, I can see that.

09:02.670 --> 09:05.879
You look like hell, Jake.
What's going on?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.539
You know, this job used to be
for heroes and risk takers.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.829
Now it's for fat-ass
apple-polishers

09:10.830 --> 09:13.499
who would rat each other out
for a corner office.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.459
You think if they were around
back in the day

09:16.460 --> 09:18.620
that the Shorepound Syndicate
would be out of business?

09:19.920 --> 09:22.080
No. No.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.669
Who gives a damn? I'm just...

09:25.670 --> 09:27.620
playing out the string.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.959
So, maybe
I should pick your brain

09:33.960 --> 09:35.670
while I still can.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.039
You okay?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.329
You don't have to answer that.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.169
Alright, so there's
these two detectives,

09:43.170 --> 09:44.669
Inoue and Hines.

09:44.670 --> 09:45.829
You know 'em?

09:45.830 --> 09:47.879
Our paths have crossed...

09:47.880 --> 09:49.539
When I had a path.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.860
If I killed someone,
I wouldn't want them working the case.

09:51.884 --> 09:54.329
What if you didn't?

09:54.330 --> 09:58.209
Um, I'd rather take my chances
with a couple of eager beavers

09:58.210 --> 10:01.999
than some pretty boy who pulled
some strings to get his shield.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.419
Alright, thank you.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.669
Thank you for that insightful
and unbiased opinion.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.209
You're welcome.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.499
Can I borrow your car?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.669
No.

10:12.670 --> 10:13.670
Alright.

10:13.671 --> 10:16.169
I'm here if you need me.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.959
Hey.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.920
Send up a flare when you decide
to rejoin the human race, okay?

10:26.170 --> 10:27.500
Okay.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.879
Maeve, Maeve.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.379
You light up this dump

11:25.380 --> 11:27.540
like a chandelier
in a dog kennel.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.329
Thanks, doll.

11:30.330 --> 11:31.669
Join me in a Mai Tai.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.669
Absolutely.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.959
Who are we drinking to?
Frank Shih?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.709
I did teach him the damn ropes.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.829
Well, to Frank...

11:42.830 --> 11:46.040
The second-greatest fence
on the Reef.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.250
Frank. Frank.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.669
You hear any word
on the street about that?

11:57.670 --> 12:00.879
How maybe Frank
brought it on himself?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.119
I'm retired, doll.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.789
I don't hear anything
like that anymore.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.329
Well...

12:07.330 --> 12:09.170
I got something
that might pique your interest.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.920
It's real.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.079
Credit Luxe.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.459
Can you help me track
the batch and vintage number?

12:25.460 --> 12:26.920
I told you, I'm retired.

12:28.420 --> 12:31.119
You know, you've told me that
many times before,

12:31.120 --> 12:32.749
but you never really meant it.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.619
Any reason you're not going
through official channels?

12:35.620 --> 12:37.749
There's no use
in giving away information

12:37.750 --> 12:39.500
before you know what you got.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.669
There's the Cat I remember,

12:42.670 --> 12:45.460
with 24-karat larceny
in her veins.

12:48.750 --> 12:52.539
So, no, you can't
trace it for me?

12:52.540 --> 12:57.169
Honey, I'm just sitting here
having my Mai Tai.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.790
See you around.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.170
Come on. Come on.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.080
Bingo.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.419
Nice try, clown!

16:41.420 --> 16:43.290
You can't shoot for crap!

16:50.960 --> 16:52.959
What else can you tell us?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.480
Like I said, he was
covered in leathers

16:54.504 --> 16:55.709
and wearing a helmet.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.999
I didn't get a good look at him.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.249
Get a look at his hand when
he fired at you? Gloves.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.499
Could it have been Finn Webb?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.289
No, it couldn't
have been Finn Webb.

17:02.290 --> 17:04.378
Finn Webb is a kid.
This was a guy.

17:04.380 --> 17:05.789
Like, a guy.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.250
Recognize this?

17:09.079 --> 17:11.419
No.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.878
We pulled this picture
from Frank Shih's phone.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.499
Word on the street is that the
kids found it out in the jungle.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.079
Okay.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.378
Where some people think
Sonny Turner went down.

17:20.380 --> 17:21.579
Sonny who?

17:21.579 --> 17:22.789
You know...

17:22.790 --> 17:25.999
stole a plane full of gold bars
11 years ago,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.079
crashed it somewhere
in the South Pacific.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.619
Our own D.B. Cooper.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.080
Never heard from again.
None of the gold recovered.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.329
How have I never heard
of this guy?

17:35.330 --> 17:36.919
I mean, I've never heard of him.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.119
Is he still alive?

17:38.120 --> 17:39.840
You're gonna fall off the grid
and stay off,

17:39.864 --> 17:41.654
the Reef is a good place
to do it.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.249
That's why you guys
are so into this case.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.749
This is like
buried treasure, right?

17:47.750 --> 17:49.079
Like a treasure hunt.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.960
There's a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

17:50.984 --> 17:52.619
The gold bar...

17:52.620 --> 17:55.669
You still have it
in your possession?

17:55.670 --> 17:57.119
I never did.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.579
Can I keep this?

17:58.580 --> 17:59.670
No.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.250
Great.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.419
Nice of you to take a break

18:07.420 --> 18:09.300
while your pals were
giving me the third degree.

18:09.324 --> 18:10.669
They are not my pals.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.110
Yeah, and in case
you were wondering,

18:12.134 --> 18:14.459
they seem to think a guy
who disappeared 11 years ago

18:14.460 --> 18:16.220
rose up from the dead
and tried to kill me...

18:16.244 --> 18:16.919
Sonny Turner.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.919
Sonny Turner? Yes.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.539
You know, it seems to me

18:20.540 --> 18:23.579
they're more interested in hunting
for buried treasure themselves.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.709
What are you saying?

18:24.710 --> 18:26.829
I'm saying that
they were more interested

18:26.830 --> 18:29.039
in the actual gold
the kids were trying to sell

18:29.040 --> 18:30.750
than in who killed Frank.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.579
It's only a matter of time

18:36.580 --> 18:38.300
before those cops
come here looking for you.

18:38.324 --> 18:39.959
Not if you don't rat us out.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.749
I'm not gonna rat you out.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.879
I'm gonna talk to Jake,
get his help.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.959
Talk to a Fed is Step One.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.079
Step Two is turn rat.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.320
You know, you know an awful lot

18:48.321 --> 18:49.961
for someone who doesn't
know an awful lot.

18:49.985 --> 18:50.879
Right, sorry.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.039
In your case,
Step Two was marry a Fed.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.879
Step Three was turn rat.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.379
You forget...
I was around back then.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.039
I saw everything.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.419
And you forget...

19:00.420 --> 19:03.789
I'm the only help you've got.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.289
Speaking of which,

19:05.290 --> 19:08.539
you're on Doug O'Casey's
nephew's call list, right?

19:08.540 --> 19:09.829
Jasper?

19:09.830 --> 19:11.039
Get me on it, too.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.499
Have him call me.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.749
Why?

19:13.750 --> 19:15.960
Well, that's
none of your business.

19:17.710 --> 19:18.919
I see you got dressed today.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.619
What's the occasion?

19:20.620 --> 19:22.249
No occasion.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.540
Heard you went
for a swim last night.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.169
Anyway,

19:30.170 --> 19:31.959
glad to see that you're alright.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.360
What do you know
about Sonny Turner?

19:34.250 --> 19:37.709
His case is as cold
as this beer.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.749
Let's see, he was a cargo pilot,

19:39.750 --> 19:41.619
he saw his big shot,
and he took it...

19:41.620 --> 19:43.539
30 mil worth of gold bars.

19:43.540 --> 19:47.079
Last known contact was
Honolulu ground control.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.459
And then he vanished.

19:48.460 --> 19:49.959
People have speculated

19:49.960 --> 19:54.209
he went down anywhere between,
well, there and here.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.039
What if someone
could find Sonny Turner

19:57.040 --> 19:58.539
and prove it was really him?

19:58.540 --> 19:59.999
It's a career maker.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.120
Or a career rescuer.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.249
See this dot right here?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.459
That is Maeve Devlin's Caddy.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.419
You're tracking her car?

20:11.420 --> 20:14.249
If bars of gold moved through
this island 11 years ago,

20:14.250 --> 20:16.829
good chance is
they moved through Maeve.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.379
Jake.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.749
I have a gold bar
in my possession.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.419
So, you've got
one of Sonny's gold bars?

20:22.420 --> 20:24.340
I don't... I don't know
if it's Sonny's gold bar,

20:24.364 --> 20:25.419
but I took it.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.539
I showed it to Maeve.

20:26.540 --> 20:30.079
She went out of her way
to act not interested.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.079
But Maeve is an old-time hood.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.879
She will never do business
on the phone,

20:33.880 --> 20:35.619
so she's got to move sometime,

20:35.620 --> 20:38.040
and when she does,
we should follow her.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.710
Maeve's on the move.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.749
Come with me.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.919
Let's follow her.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.210
Are you in?

20:54.790 --> 20:55.919
Yes.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.750
Yes. Come on.

21:01.670 --> 21:02.789
Where's my car?

21:02.790 --> 21:04.619
RPD impounded it as evidence.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.329
Plus, all the work it needs.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.010
You know, there's water damage,
bullet holes, may need a new engine.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.499
What?! Hey,
I didn't order a hit on myself.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.209
Where'd you get this go-cart?

21:13.210 --> 21:14.289
Well,

21:14.290 --> 21:15.999
it was a seized asset,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.289
and Wyatt pulled some strings.

21:19.290 --> 21:21.539
I bet he did.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.959
There's my Kitty Cat,

21:22.960 --> 21:24.499
landing on her feet.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
Whoa!

22:07.540 --> 22:08.709
Nice try.

22:08.710 --> 22:09.749
What?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.119
She's not here on business.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.040
She's visiting
her grandkid in rehab.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.790
Here.

22:20.790 --> 22:22.500
Where are you going?

23:22.210 --> 23:24.170
Hey! Cheers.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.209
Techie Jane!

23:27.210 --> 23:28.579
The Steve Jobs of the Reef.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.119
I prefer Sheryl Sandberg.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.419
Fair enough.

23:31.420 --> 23:33.749
I need you to lean in
on something for me.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.879
Kinda on lunch.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.960
Yeah, it's on me.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.960
Ooh. Big spender.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.459
Detectives Hines and Inoue...

23:42.460 --> 23:44.960
Can you pull their
vehicle dispatch logs for me?

23:46.710 --> 23:48.959
Easiest free burger
I've ever had.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.669
Yeah, those...

23:51.670 --> 23:53.510
Those records...
What do they look like to you?

23:54.830 --> 23:57.419
Looks like some of these
have been edited.

23:57.420 --> 23:58.940
The car's destination
has been altered.

23:58.964 --> 24:01.419
Can you plug their plates into
the Vehicle Asset System?

24:01.420 --> 24:02.829
Let's see where
they've really been.

24:02.830 --> 24:04.579
Okay.

24:04.580 --> 24:07.080
Here's their most common routes
for the last few months.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.959
What are these locations?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.999
They're all national forests.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.329
You think they're having
secret jungle rendezvous?

24:16.330 --> 24:18.459
No. I think I found
my gold diggers.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.670
Thanks, TJ.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.789
I guess I made a wrong turn.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.329
Can you help me
get back to the highway?

24:38.330 --> 24:40.080
Well, that depends.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.789
Tell me everything you know
about Sonny Turner.

24:43.790 --> 24:46.289
Those sound like questions
for my lawyer.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.209
Well, they can be
if you want them to be.

24:48.210 --> 24:49.619
Hey, Jake.

24:49.620 --> 24:52.959
Are you picking on defenseless
little ladies again?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.379
Well, if I find one,
I'll have her call you.

24:55.380 --> 24:56.880
I'll see you around, Maeve.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.440
Well, I figure
there's a good reason

25:05.464 --> 25:06.709
you wanted her gone.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.039
You figured right.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.830
I don't need her anymore.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.919
A decade younger, beard,
full head of hair.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.210
Meet Sonny Turner.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.249
I am Bob Clark.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.119
I can show you
a driver's license,

25:23.120 --> 25:24.419
Social Security number...

25:24.420 --> 25:26.499
I bet you can.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.459
So, this...
church you've got going...

25:29.460 --> 25:31.999
The Golden Road InterFaith
Congregation. Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.709
An interesting name.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.209
Is that what you did
with the gold?

25:36.210 --> 25:37.499
The gold you stole, Sonny?

25:37.500 --> 25:39.669
Bob.

25:39.670 --> 25:44.959
Don't make me drag your ass out
of here in handcuffs, Sonny.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.830
Not in front of all these
impressionable young minds.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.790
I had this friend growing up.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.500
Walking home from school, he always
used to like to take the long way home,

25:58.524 --> 26:03.079
just so we could walk by
the armored car depot.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.289
Watch 'em roll in empty
and roll out loaded.

26:06.290 --> 26:09.119
"Just one," he used to say.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.289
"Knock off just one of those
trucks, and you're set for life."

26:12.290 --> 26:14.169
So, what happened
to this friend?

26:14.170 --> 26:17.709
He got into a few jams.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.879
Kid stuff, mostly.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.459
One day, the judge said,

26:21.460 --> 26:24.079
"Go to jail,
or join the Marines."

26:24.080 --> 26:27.209
So, Semper Fi, Your Honor.

26:27.210 --> 26:31.709
Bunch of years later,
he's a civilian, divorced,

26:31.710 --> 26:34.249
waking up
in another chain hotel,

26:34.250 --> 26:37.079
rolling out to
a cargo hangar in Oakland.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.419
That's where that plane
from Geneva landed,

26:39.420 --> 26:41.619
full of
Singapore-bound gold bars.

26:41.620 --> 26:44.079
So easy, it felt like a joke.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.459
And then a storm hit, didn't it?

26:45.460 --> 26:47.749
About an hour west of Kauai?

26:47.750 --> 26:50.499
Thing is, until you wake up
someplace in a jungle,

26:50.500 --> 26:52.789
alive when you should be dead,

26:52.790 --> 26:55.119
you just don't know.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.539
Would you backslide
into your old ways?

26:58.540 --> 27:03.039
Or would something click inside,
set you on a new path...

27:03.040 --> 27:04.789
Giving instead of taking?

27:04.790 --> 27:08.459
See, I-I've heard stories
like this before.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.999
They're called fairy tales.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.789
Yeah, well, this one
has a happy ending.

27:11.790 --> 27:14.879
See, he salvages
some of that gold,

27:14.880 --> 27:16.709
secures a piece of land,

27:16.710 --> 27:18.119
and starts building a place

27:18.120 --> 27:20.579
like... this one.

27:20.580 --> 27:24.999
A home for people
who have no home.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.119
Doesn't add up to $30 million.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.419
Where's the rest of the gold?

27:28.420 --> 27:32.499
Next time I hear from my friend,
I'll ask.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.209
A fence named Frank Shih

27:34.210 --> 27:36.249
was found murdered
on Thursday night.

27:36.250 --> 27:39.249
You want to know where I was?

27:39.250 --> 27:42.249
I think I do.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.619
Here, on the grounds,

27:45.620 --> 27:48.460
walking the path to my cabin,
which is right over there.

27:52.790 --> 27:54.459
Let me guess...

27:54.460 --> 27:57.169
You walk that path alone.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.120
Well, I have a lot
to reflect upon.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.379
You were uncharacteristically
quiet back there.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.879
Well, that's because I don't
think the church is a scam.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.289
For one thing,
there's no pay-off.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.959
Come on. The guy's
a thief and a liar.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.329
So am I.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.249
Didn't stop you
from marrying me.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.249
He's probably the guy
that shot at you.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.789
Okay, do you
really believe that?

28:18.790 --> 28:20.379
Come on, really?

28:20.380 --> 28:21.709
Or do you just want to be

28:21.710 --> 28:24.749
the guy who catches
the notorious Sonny Turner?

28:24.750 --> 28:27.169
Of course I like the idea.

28:27.170 --> 28:29.669
All they remember is when I was
wrong, not that I was good.

28:29.670 --> 28:30.999
So, yeah.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.999
Yeah, I'd be happy to
shove Sonny Turner

28:33.000 --> 28:34.709
right in their smug, fat faces.

28:34.710 --> 28:37.379
Okay, that's great,
but I don't believe he tried to kill me,

28:37.380 --> 28:39.119
and I don't think
he killed Frank.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
Based on?

28:40.121 --> 28:42.249
My gut.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.879
Okay, assuming
that you may be right,

28:44.880 --> 28:46.419
he's still Sonny.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.919
Dig into his
Golden Road financials

28:48.920 --> 28:51.249
and his phony documents.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.730
I'm back here with
a warrant tomorrow.

28:52.754 --> 28:54.674
Alright, tough guy.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.119
Yo, Tolan.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.169
You got a 20 on Hines and Inoue?

29:08.170 --> 29:09.669
Got a tip on
those fugitive kids.

29:09.670 --> 29:10.670
Went to scoop 'em up.

29:10.670 --> 29:11.670
Where?

29:13.120 --> 29:14.920
Thanks.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.289
Police! Freeze!

29:23.290 --> 29:24.460
They found us! Run!

29:28.670 --> 29:30.040
Police!

29:31.040 --> 29:32.160
Come out with your hands up!

29:33.670 --> 29:36.460
- Down on the ground!
- Get down!

29:37.750 --> 29:39.039
We're going downtown

29:39.040 --> 29:40.879
to book you all
for the murder of Frank Shih.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.289
Unless maybe you want to show us

29:42.290 --> 29:43.670
where you found that gold bar.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.579
Where are we going?

29:56.580 --> 29:58.300
I'm going to dinner
with potential investors

29:58.324 --> 29:59.364
in the new Harbor Complex.

29:59.388 --> 30:00.879
Exciting.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.209
Not for the Governor.

30:03.210 --> 30:04.579
Well, is the Governor
more excited

30:04.580 --> 30:06.499
by my request to get
Doug O'Casey transferred

30:06.500 --> 30:07.879
off the Reef?

30:07.880 --> 30:09.749
He did not say "no."

30:09.750 --> 30:11.829
So, is that a "yes"?

30:11.830 --> 30:14.749
Weir Street
might be faster, Eddie.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.249
What's your play here, Cat?

30:16.250 --> 30:18.119
There is no play.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.169
I mean, if I can help
Jasper survive Greenbriar

30:21.170 --> 30:23.039
and get Doug O'Casey
shipped off the Reef,

30:23.040 --> 30:24.379
it's a win-win.

30:24.380 --> 30:27.040
You're asking for help
for Doug O'Casey.

30:29.420 --> 30:30.959
Yeah, that makes
a whole ton of sense.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.379
I've definitely been playing
the long game all these years.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.329
Married an undercover FBI agent,

30:36.330 --> 30:38.959
got into a shootout with
half of Doug O'Casey's gang,

30:38.960 --> 30:42.999
and then turned
state's evidence on Doug.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.709
Seriously?

30:44.710 --> 30:47.620
Is this the Governor asking,
or is it you?

30:50.580 --> 30:53.419
The Governor's considering
a move back to the States.

30:53.420 --> 30:55.020
Thinks there's
a Cabinet position for him

30:55.044 --> 30:56.254
in the next election.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.709
He moves up, there's a space
for me to move up.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.749
For that to work,

31:01.750 --> 31:04.879
neither one of us needs to
be embarrassed right now.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.579
Did you really need to take
me on this long-ass car ride

31:08.580 --> 31:09.829
to tell me no?

31:09.830 --> 31:11.329
I needed to take you
on a car ride

31:11.330 --> 31:13.919
just to say
"Make sure you want a 'yes, '

31:13.920 --> 31:15.040
because I can get you one."

31:19.920 --> 31:21.420
Hey, Wyatt. What's up?

31:25.670 --> 31:27.459
Hines and Inoue have been
hunting that wreck for two years,

31:27.460 --> 31:28.619
on and off city time.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.879
Frank Shih must've called them

31:29.880 --> 31:31.829
about the kids coming in
with the gold bar,

31:31.830 --> 31:33.919
sent them a photo,
things went south,

31:33.920 --> 31:35.249
and they took Frank out.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.709
Now they need
Petra and her friends

31:36.710 --> 31:37.959
to show them where the gold is.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.249
I got to go.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.170
Wait, do you know
where they're going?

31:40.171 --> 31:42.329
I don't, but I know who does!

31:42.330 --> 31:44.709
Find Jake! I'll call you!

31:44.710 --> 31:46.330
Okay, just be careful.

31:54.710 --> 31:55.790
Come on.

31:58.790 --> 32:00.169
Moment of truth has arrived.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.329
The moment of truth?
Listen to me.

32:02.330 --> 32:06.039
A few kids found Sonny Turner's
wreck a couple of days ago,

32:06.040 --> 32:08.959
and now they are headed back out
there with guns to their heads,

32:08.960 --> 32:12.749
and the only person who can
help me find them and save them

32:12.750 --> 32:14.499
is Sonny Turner.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.579
So let's quit the game.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.710
Help me.

32:35.290 --> 32:37.750
You understand the deal, right?

32:40.460 --> 32:42.879
She comes up with the gold,

32:42.880 --> 32:46.289
or none of you ever walk out
of the jungle again.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.290
Ready to go?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.920
Come on. Let's go.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.539
- Up.
- Come on.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.209
Up. That's it.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.920
Move your dumb asses.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.499
Follow me.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.329
Are you sure this is the spot?

33:44.330 --> 33:45.670
Follow me.

33:52.460 --> 33:53.919
You know where we're headed?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.249
Wya 100 yards into the jungle

33:55.250 --> 33:56.770
from the south entrance
of Tiger's Eye.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.539
It's through here?

33:59.540 --> 34:00.669
Yes or no?

34:00.670 --> 34:01.920
Yes.

34:21.330 --> 34:22.879
She give you coordinates?

34:22.880 --> 34:25.289
No, but I got a vague bearing.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.500
Vague?

34:27.620 --> 34:29.668
This is a fool's errand.

34:29.670 --> 34:30.998
Up here.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.119
I think. You think?

34:33.120 --> 34:34.290
Hope we're not too late.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.379
No more games.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.539
We didn't come to
this rathole for junk.

35:04.540 --> 35:05.919
Where's the gold?

35:05.920 --> 35:08.000
I found it up there
behind the big rock.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.000
Keep an eye on them.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.209
Stay here.

35:24.210 --> 35:25.620
What do you see?

35:30.580 --> 35:31.790
Anything?

35:41.750 --> 35:43.120
There's nothing up there.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.120
Hey, genius!

35:56.040 --> 35:57.289
My God!

35:57.290 --> 35:59.540
Come on.

36:02.790 --> 36:04.379
Hey.

36:04.380 --> 36:06.500
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.079
Wya So, it looks like we can
tear up those murder warrants.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.379
They're free to go?

36:16.380 --> 36:18.499
Yeah, they still
have to testify.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.780
Now, come on.
Get out of my desk.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.329
Fine.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.789
See you later. Yeah.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.670
Yeah, we'll run with that.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.119
You really think
he's telling the truth?

36:33.120 --> 36:34.920
I think whatever he did
pull out of that crash

36:34.944 --> 36:36.854
he put to good use.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.119
My turn to tell a story.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.829
Well, I'm a good listener.

36:51.830 --> 36:53.879
About a guy I worked with.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.669
More of a grinder
than a superstar.

36:56.670 --> 36:59.249
Didn't always kiss
the right asses.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.829
So, later on,

37:00.830 --> 37:02.579
when this guy made
a few mistakes,

37:02.580 --> 37:03.999
they hung him out to dry.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.749
Career was hanging by a thread.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.119
Maybe it was just time
for him to move on.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.709
Yeah, maybe.

37:11.710 --> 37:15.960
Then one day, this case
just drops in his lap.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.879
One that would put him
in the history books,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.709
never mind back in the game.

37:22.710 --> 37:24.579
Thing is, though,

37:24.580 --> 37:29.580
in order to prove that he was
bigger than his past mistakes,

37:29.710 --> 37:32.289
he would have to lock up
a man who...

37:32.290 --> 37:34.040
had already proven just that.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.829
Anyway, this guy realized

37:37.830 --> 37:41.379
that he didn't give a damn
about the empty suits in D.C.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.960
He knew who he was.

37:47.170 --> 37:51.379
Turns out that...
case was never closed.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.000
That's the story
the guy told me.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.619
Heck of an ending.

37:56.620 --> 37:58.710
Let's make sure
it stays that way?

38:05.330 --> 38:06.999
Your boyfriend says I testify,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
or I'll get locked up
for obstruction or something.

38:09.024 --> 38:12.669
Okay, that's not gonna happen,
and he's not my boyfriend.

38:12.670 --> 38:13.879
No? No.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.800
I see him sneaking out
of the house all the time.

38:15.824 --> 38:18.079
What are you... Are you
spying on me or something?

38:18.080 --> 38:19.329
You're welcome, by the way.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.330
For what?

38:20.331 --> 38:22.670
Well, I saved your life.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.499
I took care of that thing
you wanted, with Jasper.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.330
Thank you.
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna owe you.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.419
Hey.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.539
You let him go.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.120
That's the man I knew.

38:51.210 --> 38:53.250
I'm still waiting on those
divorce papers, Cat.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.289
Hello?
You have received a collect call

39:22.290 --> 39:25.539
from an inmate at Greenbriar
Correctional Institution.

39:25.540 --> 39:27.999
To accept charges
for this call, press 1.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.039
To decline...

39:30.040 --> 39:31.169
Hello?

39:31.170 --> 39:32.789
Cat?

39:32.790 --> 39:33.919
You there?

39:33.920 --> 39:36.329
Hey, Jasper.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.289
It's good to hear your voice.

39:38.290 --> 39:40.039
I thought you forgot
about me, Cat.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.499
No, no, I wouldn't do that.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.999
How are you?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.329
I'm doing okay.

39:46.330 --> 39:48.379
Yeah?

39:48.380 --> 39:51.080
Your uncle said you were
having a tough time.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.959
You know, I spoke to Jasper.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.709
He says what's up?

39:58.710 --> 40:01.709
Turns out he's never been
in the hole, not even once.

40:01.710 --> 40:03.119
Got his GED.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.619
He's doing great time.

40:04.620 --> 40:07.539
He's gonna be eligible
for parole in two years.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.170
Seems I was misinformed.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.789
You're a lot of things, Doug.

40:14.790 --> 40:16.709
But you're not stupid.

40:16.710 --> 40:19.329
You knew I'd figure out
your story didn't hold up,

40:19.330 --> 40:21.209
which leads me to believe
you're lying to me,

40:21.210 --> 40:22.709
and you wanted to stay

40:22.710 --> 40:25.249
off the transfer list
to Greenbriar

40:25.250 --> 40:27.830
and stay right here on the Reef.

40:29.580 --> 40:31.619
See, this is what I miss.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.379
Playing chess with you.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.959
I miss it, too.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.709
The problem is,
both of us cheat.

40:39.710 --> 40:42.249
I'm gonna find out
whatever you're up to,

40:42.250 --> 40:45.289
and I'm gonna drive a stake
through you with it

40:45.290 --> 40:46.749
once and for all.

40:46.750 --> 40:47.880
I'm counting on it.

40:51.170 --> 40:52.620
I'm counting on it, Cat.

40:53.305 --> 40:59.531
