00:14.682 --> 00:19.687
[bell tolling]

00:28.629 --> 00:32.600
[cats meowing]

00:49.350 --> 00:52.320
Charlie?

00:52.353 --> 00:55.256
Ch-- Charlie, come on.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.263
Not going to the funeral?

01:02.296 --> 01:03.664
No, didn't
know her, really.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.533
Is that on credit?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.301
Unfortunately.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.204
Makes you think,
though. Huh?

01:10.238 --> 01:12.806
Certainly does.
Wonder what he'll
say at my funeral.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.477
Ah, something nice,
I'm sure.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.546
There you are.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.115
Sorry.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.387
[chirping]

01:26.420 --> 01:27.388
Good boy.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.624
That's it.
Good boy.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.893
That's it.
That's it.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.463
Come on.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.098
Here we go.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.335
No! No!
Charlie, no!

01:41.369 --> 01:42.836
Oh, no.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.808
Oh, you bloody bugger.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.646
Want some juice?

01:54.482 --> 01:56.350
How much did that cost?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.319
I don't know.
A few bucks.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.322
Yeah? Used every fucking
cent we got, Dale.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.558
Well, I'll put it
on my card, Ron.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.260
No.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.329
They can trace after us.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.531
Give me the cash.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.700
Let's do a runner, huh?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.535
They've seen
the car, Ron.

02:14.568 --> 02:18.606
Now give me the cash,
and I'll sort it out.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.375
It's only a few bucks.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.349
Listen, you either
pay me the right money,
or I'll call the cops.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.817
It's $4.50.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.220
Fine.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.588
Look, I hate to put you
in this situation.

02:34.622 --> 02:38.459
Is there anything
I could do

02:38.492 --> 02:41.229
that might
square things up?

02:46.867 --> 02:49.970
You'd be all right
until about nightfall.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.539
Here we go.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.459
[man moaning]

03:16.797 --> 03:18.566
[Dale]
Jesus, Ron!

03:18.599 --> 03:20.734
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.436
He was calling
the cops!

03:24.672 --> 03:26.907
You gave him a blow job?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.510
[no audible dialogue]

04:09.016 --> 04:11.919
[dog barking in distance]

04:14.888 --> 04:17.658
What was that back there?

04:17.690 --> 04:18.959
What the fuck
were you thinking?

04:18.992 --> 04:22.496
What is Joey doing
in the boot of the car?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.897
What'd you want me
to do with him,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.899
leave him in
the fucking car park, Dale?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.968
I'm trying to get you
out of that life, Dale,

04:28.001 --> 04:29.537
and the first
chance you get,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.539
you're giving
a blow to some servo
attendant for 4.50!

04:31.572 --> 04:33.374
It was a fucking
handjob, Ron.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.642
Pardon me.
Same difference.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.610
It's a big
fucking difference.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.480
One's with the hand,
and one's with the mouth.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.550
Shit. Shit, Ron.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.385
Fucking turn off!
Turn off!

04:44.418 --> 04:45.586
Just sit still and
stay calm, all right?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.354
Don't shoot anybody, Ron.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.655
Don't fucking shoot any--
Shut up!

04:47.688 --> 04:51.592
[siren]

04:55.496 --> 04:58.432
All right, we're
gonna dump the car.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.502
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

05:40.874 --> 05:44.445
Oh. That's nice.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.615
We should be able
to hot-wire it.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.054
Maybe the keys
are in the house.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.527
Come on.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.974
[muttering]

07:01.254 --> 07:02.456
Hey, Ron.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.065
What--

07:12.099 --> 07:13.867
Wh-what are you
doing here?

07:16.504 --> 07:17.638
No!
Ron, no!

07:17.671 --> 07:19.239
Please don't hurt me.
Shut up!

07:19.272 --> 07:20.941
What's your name,
asshole?

07:20.974 --> 07:22.743
Andrew.
Andrew?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.478
Asshole,
I was close wasn't I?

07:24.512 --> 07:26.480
Give me your wallet.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.548
Get it out!

07:31.084 --> 07:33.186
That's it?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.856
Where are your car keys?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.725
In the box
on the table over there.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.792
Get them, babe.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.496
Here, hold that.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.033
Get on your stomach.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.267
Come on!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.769
You alone?
Yes.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.508
All right?
Look for some cash
or something.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.843
All right.

08:15.563 --> 08:20.568
[tone beeping]

08:40.587 --> 08:43.591
[tone beeping]

08:55.002 --> 08:56.570
Shit.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.606
Oh, my God.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.608
Yeah!

09:00.641 --> 09:05.178
[tone beeping]

09:12.786 --> 09:15.656
Ah, yes.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.644
[Ron]
Hurry up, Dale!

09:36.677 --> 09:37.344
We're out of here!

09:42.015 --> 09:44.151
Here's the plan, And.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.286
You're going to drive
us up North.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.657
Dale is going to be in the boot
until we get out of Bowral,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.291
and I'm going to be
right behind you,

09:51.324 --> 09:54.261
with my shotty sticking
straight up your ass.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.296
When we get
to Queensland,

09:56.329 --> 09:58.398
you're going to pull
over to an auto teller,

09:58.431 --> 10:00.901
and you're going to
withdraw up to your limit.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.871
Now, I'm doing this
because, you see,

10:03.904 --> 10:07.174
my girlfriend,
she's got a soft heart.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.176
But if it was up to me,

10:09.209 --> 10:12.780
you'd be dead already.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.916
Am I getting through
to you, Andy?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.051
I-I can't.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.087
No, really, you can.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.955
No, you don't
understand, I'm--

10:21.989 --> 10:24.124
No, you don't understand.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.625
So?

10:27.427 --> 10:30.363
What do you think?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.398
Women.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.800
We need cash, Dale.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.101
There isn't none.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.937
God, you are
fucking killing me.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.812
No, please no!

10:44.845 --> 10:46.313
I can't go outside!
Please!

10:46.346 --> 10:47.347
No! Please!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.683
I'm afraid of open spaces.
I can't go outside!

10:49.717 --> 10:51.151
Yeah? Well, I'm afraid

10:51.184 --> 10:52.352
of enclosed spaces,
like jail!

10:52.385 --> 10:53.754
Please!

10:53.787 --> 10:56.223
No!

10:56.256 --> 10:58.792
Get out!

11:00.027 --> 11:01.895
Get up. Get up!

11:01.929 --> 11:04.464
You are being
a very bad hostage.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.767
Come on!
Get up now.
[helicopter hovering]

11:06.800 --> 11:08.035
Fuck!

11:08.068 --> 11:09.036
Coppers!

11:09.069 --> 11:10.871
Get back. Get back.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.377
Come back inside, Andy.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.447
Come back
in the house, Andy!

11:23.350 --> 11:25.886
Come in the house, Andy!

11:25.919 --> 11:27.454
Come on, Andy.

11:29.757 --> 11:30.991
[door slams]

11:34.327 --> 11:37.731
P-pills.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.332
[Andrew]
My pills.
What the fuck?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.935
Bathroom--
bathroom drawer.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.374
[whispers]
Shit.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.319
Servos, jumpers--

11:59.352 --> 12:00.921
We've got it.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.430
What the fuck
is the matter with him?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.865
He's agoraphobic.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.433
Agora what?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.103
I don't know, he says
he can't go outside.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.110
No, no!

12:23.143 --> 12:24.511
No!

12:34.587 --> 12:35.789
Please!

12:35.823 --> 12:37.124
He said he can't
go outside.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.158
He's outside now!

12:41.228 --> 12:43.763
[sobbing]

12:52.372 --> 12:53.440
Bloody human boomerang.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.916
[whimpering]

13:27.140 --> 13:29.409
[whispers]
Shit.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.250
All right--

13:37.284 --> 13:39.386
We just keep our
heads down for a bit.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.088
A day or so,
they'll call it off

13:41.121 --> 13:43.823
and then we can get
the hell out of here.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.560
[Dale]
Ron?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.398
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
Where is it?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.503
Fuck!

13:58.505 --> 14:00.140
Fuck!

14:02.542 --> 14:05.478
They got my face.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.618
If we just done a runner,
when I said so,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.486
we'd be halfway there,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.422
but no, you got
to sort it out.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.457
Well, we're fucking
sorted now, aren't we?

14:17.490 --> 14:20.160
Dead guy at the
service station,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.195
and our hostage is going
to go the same way.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.496
No, he's not.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.165
You're never killing him.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.499
You're right.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.535
It's about time you did
your own dirty work.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.537
You know how I promised,
remember?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.073
I'm not doing that.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.508
Bet you're not,
you lazy bitch.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.377
I'm not lazy.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.081
Hey, I'm not the only
one that says so, all right?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.415
I am not lazy.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.587
Come on, stop it.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.588
Don't touch me.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.057
Don't.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.392
Oh, babe, come on.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.361
Go then!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
Fucking hell.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
I won't forget this,
you prick.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.666
[tone beeping]

14:59.699 --> 15:01.601
[Ron]
Dale!

15:13.413 --> 15:15.548
I'm sorry.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.150
I'm not fucking
lazy, Ron.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.154
I might be a pig,
all right?

15:21.188 --> 15:24.357
I'm a fucking pig...

15:24.391 --> 15:25.658
that loves you.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.527
I just like you
the way you are.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.661
Huh?

15:28.695 --> 15:31.564
[tone beeping]

15:33.066 --> 15:36.269
Not dressed up
like a champion.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.404
Bitch.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.538
Bitch.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.573
You know?

15:42.709 --> 15:48.381
I want to do some nasty,
nasty shit to you.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.300
You're not wearing
any undies.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.570
You don't wear undies
in a dress like this.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.512
[clicks]

16:19.546 --> 16:24.384
[dial tone]

16:24.417 --> 16:26.519
[dialing]

16:27.520 --> 16:29.556
You're bloody
so fucking hot.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.533
Yeah? Do you want
me to fuck you?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.568
Yeah.

16:53.480 --> 16:59.419
[line ringing]

17:04.424 --> 17:06.226
You got a death wish, eh?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.794
Because I can grant it,
dickhead.

17:07.827 --> 17:11.364
No worries at all.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.800
I've thought of a way...

17:13.833 --> 17:16.103
I can get you $40,000.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.540
Say that again.

17:21.574 --> 17:26.445
I can get you $40,000
in two days.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.082
What are you doing?

17:29.116 --> 17:32.485
Our friend Andy
just made a proposition.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.157
This better be good.

17:37.190 --> 17:41.361
It's a trust fund
that my mother set up.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.562
That must be nice.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.733
And this just tops
up every fortnight.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.201
Bullshit!

17:48.235 --> 17:50.503
Look, all we have to do
is take the first check

17:50.537 --> 17:55.475
to the bank tomorrow, and
they will give you $20,000.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.844
Then when the account
is topped up overnight,

17:57.877 --> 18:01.548
you take the second
check in on the Tuesday.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.483
Look, the local bank
knows about my condition

18:03.516 --> 18:06.186
and they will call
here for a password.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.755
Once I speak to them,
they will pay out in full,

18:08.788 --> 18:13.493
and you will have
$40,000 in your hand.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.295
Who does this
for you normally?

18:15.328 --> 18:16.829
Lilly-- Lilly,
my housekeeper.

18:16.863 --> 18:21.568
Aw, as if they're going
to give us 20 grand in cash!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.304
They will if--

18:27.407 --> 18:29.176
If you become my fiancÃ©e.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.579
I don't look
nothing like her.
Let him finish.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.680
When I walked
in that first time,

18:33.713 --> 18:34.881
when I saw you
standing there--

18:34.914 --> 18:36.149
I'm not doing it.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.251
You were so just like--

18:38.285 --> 18:40.453
Look, Gabrielle's only been
to Bowral a couple of times.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.322
If you were to dye
your hair blonde--

18:42.355 --> 18:45.192
Where is this fiancÃ©e?
She's overseas.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.193
She's--
Ron!

18:46.226 --> 18:48.461
Babe!

18:50.363 --> 18:52.599
Is your fiancÃ©e really
as pretty as my Dale here?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.935
That dress is a perfect
fit, isn't it?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.471
I'm not doing it,
I'll get caught!

18:58.505 --> 19:01.774
Why am I the only one that
has to take a risk, huh?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.277
This is typical of you.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.579
Can't do a bloody thing.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.515
Just take a look at me.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.517
Now look around you.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.888
I could never be her.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.592
Ron, I really
don't think

19:19.626 --> 19:21.528
that's the way
to talk to her.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.432
Andy, I really
don't think

19:25.465 --> 19:26.799
that's the way
to talk to Ron.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.769
[Ron]
Dale?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.441
Hey, you.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.480
I'm scared.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.485
I know you are, babe.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.953
I'm scared, too.

[chatter on TV]

21:49.642 --> 21:51.043
Grow up, Andy.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.516
So what's she like,
this chick?

21:56.549 --> 21:59.085
Does she talk like you?

21:59.118 --> 22:00.620
I suppose so.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.428
You can look
at me, Andy.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.629
You never been
to a strip club?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.498
No, I haven't.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.567
So how long has
she been away?

22:14.601 --> 22:16.403
Six months.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.970
You don't worry
she got her legs

22:18.004 --> 22:19.639
wrapped around some
other guy by now?

22:19.672 --> 22:22.008
No. She's not like that.
Like what?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.743
Normal?

22:26.413 --> 22:27.414
Like you.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.117
Let me tell you
something, Andy.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.822
They're all like me.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.027
Well! What do you know?

If you even wink
at these pricks,

23:21.934 --> 23:23.570
you're fucked!
What's going on?

23:23.603 --> 23:25.171
Cops are
at the door.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.439
Oh, fuck!

23:29.942 --> 23:32.445
Say anything you want.
Just get rid of him.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.780
I've killed two people.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.549

Mr. Shepard?

23:47.627 --> 23:48.895
Yes?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.196
How can I help you?

23:50.229 --> 23:53.032
I'm Sergeant Widdens,
this is Constable Blarney.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.635
We're with the
Bowral Police.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.805

in touch with us.

been able to raise you.

Oh--

24:03.242 --> 24:05.478
You all right,
Mr. Shepard?
Yes, I'm fine.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.547
Would you prefer
if we came inside?

24:14.854 --> 24:18.591
I've been
overdoing it a bit.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.194
My fiancÃ©e rang
a few days ago.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.663

to pick up her things.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.738
Yeah, well--

24:31.771 --> 24:34.273
I know how these things
can get on top of you,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.142
but if you could call her,
I'd appreciate it.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.578
I'm really sorry
to have troubled you.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.114
Yes, I'm sorry, but
thanks for your concern.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.817
No, no, I was actually
really touched.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.785
No, I should have called.

25:52.819 --> 25:55.788
Listen, I, uh--

25:55.822 --> 25:57.890
If you-- I don't want
you to come in tomorrow

25:57.924 --> 25:59.058
if that's all right.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.761
No, next Tuesday
will be fine.

26:01.794 --> 26:05.364
You know, the usual
personal things, Lilly.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.634
All right, then,
well, next week.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.367
Okay.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.269

[phone beeps]

26:15.407 --> 26:17.644
You did good.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.780

a very good crim.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.715

26:22.749 --> 26:24.250
You have earned
yourself a shower.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.826
Frittata!

26:33.860 --> 26:35.094
How are you going
to live in Thailand

26:35.127 --> 26:36.663
if you can't eat
real food?

26:36.696 --> 26:39.766
I've had Thai, okay?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.334
This is just an omelet
for wankers!

26:42.368 --> 26:44.336
I reckon he's a poofter.

26:46.372 --> 26:49.241
Haven't you noticed?
He likes it when
I tie him up.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.913

You're so cute
when you're an idiot.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.756
Don't call me cute
all right?

27:06.693 --> 27:08.027
Kittens are cute.

from outside his club

29:01.407 --> 29:03.943

as armed and dangerous.

traveling with a woman

That's why I'm not
worried about you.

33:31.277 --> 33:32.278
So.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.247
How do I look?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.315
Gum.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.411
Don't, Ronnie.
My lipstick.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.344
Did a good job, Andy.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.280
I hardly
recognized her.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.549
Glad you approve.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.083
Oh, I didn't
say that, did I?

34:49.221 --> 34:51.456
So you enjoy
yourself up there?

34:51.489 --> 34:52.491
Huh?

34:53.492 --> 34:55.460
Dressing her up?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.396
Doing her hair?

34:59.298 --> 35:01.133
Hey, And,
you can admit it.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.335
She's hot. Right?

35:03.369 --> 35:04.570
She's very sweet.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.637
Come on, And!

35:05.671 --> 35:07.739
You've been checking her out
ever since we got here.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.375
No, no, no.
I haven't. I--

35:09.408 --> 35:11.477
You sayin'
she's a dog? Huh?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.579
No, no.
Of course I'm not.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.147
So you have been
checking her out.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.648
No, no, no.
She's your girl, Ron--

35:16.682 --> 35:18.517
That's right, And!

35:18.550 --> 35:20.819
That's right.
She's my girl.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.191
And you wanna fuck her.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.425
No, no.
It's not true.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.760
You think
she's hot, hmm?

35:28.794 --> 35:31.363
And you'd like
to fuck her.
No, Ron.

35:31.397 --> 35:32.564
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

35:32.598 --> 35:33.665
to fuck her.
No!

35:33.699 --> 35:35.567
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

35:35.601 --> 35:36.535
to fuck her!
No, Ron!

35:36.568 --> 35:38.304
You wanna fuck her,
don't ya? Yeah, Andy!

35:38.337 --> 35:39.405
Come on!
You wanna fuck her!

35:39.438 --> 35:40.772
Yes! Yes!
All right! Yes!
Ah!

35:40.806 --> 35:42.641
I'm only fucking
with you, Andy.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.147
But maybe I'm not.

36:19.545 --> 36:20.946
[Man]
Next, please.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.552
Next, please!

36:29.421 --> 36:31.390
I've got this check
for you to cash.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.465
I-- I've left--

36:39.498 --> 36:40.732
[footsteps departing]

36:43.001 --> 36:44.202
[whispers]
Shit.

36:50.809 --> 36:54.546
[doorbell chimes]

36:58.284 --> 36:59.618
[clattering]

36:59.651 --> 37:00.952
It's a lovely
piece, that.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.256
Dressed in porcelain
in Amalou.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.691
That's 1780.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.660
It's quite unusual.
Look.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.562
It's lovely.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.998
Are you after anything
in particular?

37:13.031 --> 37:15.501
No, just browsing.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.603
Of course.
Feel free.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.504
Do you live locally?

37:21.407 --> 37:23.375
Yes. Um--

37:23.409 --> 37:24.610
We're just out of town.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.712
Well, look, let me get
you one of my cards.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.381
I have contacts here
and overseas,

37:29.415 --> 37:31.583
so often, if you're after
something specific,

37:31.617 --> 37:33.519
I can source it
for you.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.754
But next time,
you might want to bring
your partner in--

37:36.988 --> 37:37.989
Or not.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.465
I have this check
for you to cash.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.933
Sure.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.447
[grunts]

38:05.851 --> 38:07.686
Now, your chick...

38:09.655 --> 38:10.789
She's hot.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.529
I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.630
No.
Good.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.366
Because I'd really
like to fuck her.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.903
I bet you she'd be
a goer, too. Huh?

38:28.407 --> 38:30.442
She like it hard
and fast?

38:30.476 --> 38:31.343
Am I right?

38:34.145 --> 38:36.081
She like a bit of
dirty talk, you know?

38:37.483 --> 38:39.485
She like it when
you call her a slut?

38:39.518 --> 38:42.688
Just when you're
into it? You know?

38:42.721 --> 38:45.457
Just before she comes?

38:45.491 --> 38:49.060
Give her a bit of,
"You slut."

38:49.094 --> 38:50.529
"You bitch."

38:50.562 --> 38:51.897
[chuckling]

38:51.930 --> 38:53.565
She'd love that,
wouldn't she?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.638
What's she like in the
rumpy department, And?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.675
She a moaner?

39:03.709 --> 39:06.745
Or a screamer?

39:06.778 --> 39:08.647
[whispers]
I bet you she's
a screamer.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.751
You're losing her, Ron.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.487
[chuckles]

39:15.521 --> 39:19.024
What?
She's bored already.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.159
Haven't you noticed?
Shut the fuck up.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.662
She's slipping away.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.668
How does that feel?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.040
Knowing that you're--

39:35.073 --> 39:38.444
not...quite...

39:38.477 --> 39:39.478
adequate?

39:42.548 --> 39:44.616
[grunting]

39:51.590 --> 39:53.459
[line ringing]

39:55.561 --> 39:57.028
[ringing continues]

39:58.497 --> 39:59.831
[phone ringing]

39:59.865 --> 40:02.100
[glass shattering]

40:02.133 --> 40:03.469
[shouting]
Come on!

40:03.502 --> 40:06.505
[ringing continues]

40:10.842 --> 40:12.578
[ringing continues]

40:13.945 --> 40:15.113
[ringing]

40:19.985 --> 40:22.921
[ringing]

40:26.558 --> 40:28.994
If the phone rings out,
you're dead.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.796
[ringing]

40:34.065 --> 40:35.534
Hello?
Andrew Shepard.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.535
Frank, yes.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.870
I need to verify
some I.D.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.506
Gabrielle
Elizabeth Martin.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.674
[panting]

40:42.708 --> 40:43.942
[stuttering]
Yes, it's my fiancÃ©e.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.176
Okay. And password.

40:47.746 --> 40:48.980
Restraint.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.448
All right.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.884
Good.
Yes.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.586
Thank you. Yes.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.621
We're gonna be doing
this again tomorrow.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.655
Is that all right?

40:56.688 --> 40:57.789
Yes. That's fine.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.698
Want your license back?

41:06.732 --> 41:08.567
We don't have
anything larger.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.636
So that's 10, 12, 14,

41:12.137 --> 41:13.972
16, 18,

41:15.306 --> 41:16.575
19, and 20,000.

41:21.813 --> 41:22.948
Thank you.

41:36.928 --> 41:37.863
Miss?

41:37.896 --> 41:39.197
Excuse me. Miss.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.169
This your car?

41:44.202 --> 41:46.204
It belongs to my fiancÃ©.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.243
The door was unlocked.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.781
I wouldn't do that
around here.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.850
Sorry.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.591
[engine starts]

42:18.236 --> 42:19.971
[bird whistling]

42:25.276 --> 42:27.212
[whistling continues]

42:27.245 --> 42:29.881
[sighs]

42:29.915 --> 42:30.949
[shouting]

42:30.982 --> 42:32.918
[laughing, muttering]

42:40.258 --> 42:41.693
Here's my money.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.666
[door closes]

42:47.699 --> 42:49.835
[Ron laughing]

42:49.868 --> 42:51.803
I did it.
I actually did it, Andy.

42:51.837 --> 42:54.773
It was extraordinary.
They believed everything
that I was saying.

42:54.806 --> 42:56.608
You know, they treated me
like I was someone special!

42:56.642 --> 42:58.343
That's what I'm
talkin' about, Andy.

42:58.376 --> 43:01.647
You feel alive, huh?
You did good, baby!

43:01.680 --> 43:04.215
[squealing]
You did good!

43:04.249 --> 43:06.618
I just felt
so comfortable.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.820
Just shows, when one makes
a little bit of effort

43:08.854 --> 43:10.321
with your appearance
and whatnot,

43:10.355 --> 43:12.223
and the attitude, darling,

43:12.257 --> 43:14.359
the attitude
of those around you
completely changes.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.628
Yeah, well, you can
drop the attitude now.

43:16.662 --> 43:18.263
She's amongst friends now,
isn't she, Andy?

43:18.296 --> 43:20.766
Sorry, darling. To what
attitude to you refer?

43:20.799 --> 43:22.200
[shouting]
The attitude, babe!

43:22.233 --> 43:24.335
The accent, all right?
It's not funny!

43:24.369 --> 43:25.771
[laughing]

43:25.804 --> 43:26.938
I knew you
could do it.

43:26.972 --> 43:29.007
You could
almost be her.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.176
Gold! Hoo-hoo!

43:31.209 --> 43:33.378
We are celebrating
tonight, my friends!

43:33.411 --> 43:38.049
[crickets chirping]

43:48.794 --> 43:50.662
You ever order in, Andy?

43:53.164 --> 43:54.399
I'm sorry?
You know.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.668
Whores.

43:56.702 --> 43:58.804
Hoochie mamas.

43:58.837 --> 43:59.938
You getting me?

44:01.206 --> 44:03.875
[chuckling]

44:03.909 --> 44:05.276
What?

44:05.310 --> 44:06.878
Six months
without a screw?

44:06.912 --> 44:09.314
No wonder you're
tropo, mate!

44:09.347 --> 44:12.250
Come on, And. You gotta
learn to live a little,
you know?

44:12.283 --> 44:13.885
I mean, look at that.

44:13.919 --> 44:15.020
Now that's a
disgrace, man.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.822
You've been on that
all night.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.796
No wonder.

44:27.899 --> 44:28.934
Hang on.

44:30.468 --> 44:31.770
I know what
you need.

44:33.805 --> 44:35.373
Now where's
the ice cream?

44:35.406 --> 44:37.308
In the chest freezer,
on the side.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.409
By the fridge.

44:40.812 --> 44:42.914
[clattering]

44:56.494 --> 44:59.731
Can I introduce you
to a titillating sensation?

45:02.300 --> 45:03.869
That a hundred dollars
a bottle, Ron.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.370
There's some cheap stuff
in the fridge--

45:05.403 --> 45:07.138
Fuck the cheap stuff.
We're celebrating, mate!

45:07.172 --> 45:08.439
[pops cork]
Woo!

45:10.475 --> 45:12.010
[chuckles]

45:17.348 --> 45:21.052
I give you...
the champagne spider.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.860
[sighs]

45:28.894 --> 45:31.062
It's like poetry.

45:31.096 --> 45:33.031
Come on. Give your
Master Tom a good swipe.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.199
I really don't
think it's my--

45:34.232 --> 45:35.934
Oh, and you haven't
even tried it!

45:37.202 --> 45:38.436
Come on.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.544
Well, I'll be damned.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.947
Isn't that some
gourmet shit?
[laughing]

45:48.980 --> 45:50.115
Drink up, lads!

45:57.455 --> 45:59.825
So what's with all
the paintings, mate?

45:59.858 --> 46:01.192
You an art dealer?

46:02.360 --> 46:05.563
I used to be.
I'm more of a collector now.

46:05.596 --> 46:06.564
Right.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.567
With your private income.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.269
That's right.

46:13.204 --> 46:14.505
I was also a dealer.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.278
Dad was a druggie.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.214
Your old man's
in mining, right?

46:25.851 --> 46:27.152
Among other things.

46:28.353 --> 46:30.555
Little tension between
you and the old man,
is there?

46:31.990 --> 46:33.925
[sighs]

46:35.060 --> 46:37.395
How about your mum?

46:37.428 --> 46:39.364
She died a few years ago.

46:44.435 --> 46:46.337
Sorry to hear it.

46:46.371 --> 46:48.439
Mine's still around.

46:48.473 --> 46:50.041
She breeds dogs.

46:50.075 --> 46:52.377
That's what
I'm gonna do, too.

46:58.416 --> 47:01.052
Back.

47:01.086 --> 47:03.321
Now what sort,
do you reckon?

47:03.354 --> 47:05.456
I have no idea, Ron.
Just have a guess.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.557
I don't know--
Go on, have a guess!

47:06.591 --> 47:08.894
I really don't know.
Have a guess!
Play the game!

47:10.261 --> 47:11.496
Play the game.

47:13.364 --> 47:15.500
Rottweilers?
Pit bulls?

47:18.236 --> 47:19.637
Poodles, mate.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.306
Miniatures.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.374
That's what I'm using
your money for in Thailand.

47:23.408 --> 47:24.943
I'm gonna start
my own kennel.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.979
Look anywhere in Asia now.
What do you see?

47:28.013 --> 47:30.115
Gucci. McDonald's.
Coca-fucking-Cola.

47:30.148 --> 47:32.150
You see, they get
to a certain level,

47:32.183 --> 47:33.985
and they all want
to be white.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.386
[chuckling]

47:35.420 --> 47:37.522
Jesus, Ron!

47:37.555 --> 47:39.124
You shut up, babe!
Look.

47:39.157 --> 47:42.160
Mercedes Benz.
Little bloody poodles!
[Dale laughs]

47:42.193 --> 47:44.395
Every little yellow
bastard is gonna want one,

47:44.429 --> 47:46.998
either as a pet,
or on the barbie.

47:47.032 --> 47:50.969
[laughing]

47:51.002 --> 47:52.503
What?

47:56.407 --> 47:57.542
I like it, Ron.

47:57.575 --> 47:59.410
I think it's
a very good idea.

47:59.444 --> 48:01.479
I knew you'd get it!
[laughing]

48:01.512 --> 48:02.480
[Dale]
What's this one?

48:02.513 --> 48:05.083
It's jazz.
New Orleans-style.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.384
How do you play it?
You don't.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.486
It's never been played.
It's a first edition.

48:08.519 --> 48:09.620
What's the point
of having a record

48:09.654 --> 48:11.489
if you're not
gonna play it?

48:11.522 --> 48:13.224
I just don't think
it's your type of thing.

48:15.426 --> 48:16.928
Put the fucking
thing on.

48:26.371 --> 48:27.538
You know nothing
about me.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.240
All right? Nothing.

48:36.014 --> 48:39.317
** [piano jazz]

48:39.350 --> 48:41.319
See, I like that.
Yeah!

48:43.388 --> 48:45.056
10 to 15 inches.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.358
See, that's your miniatures.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.527
Anything under that
is just a toy.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.529
Good water dogs.

48:51.562 --> 48:54.432
* You're
a voodoo lover *
[chuckling]

48:54.465 --> 48:57.468
* Gonna cast
your spell on me *

48:59.437 --> 49:01.372
* But what's
got me worried *

49:01.406 --> 49:03.374
* I don't want to be

49:03.408 --> 49:05.443
What are you laughing at?
* Set free

49:05.476 --> 49:08.513
Come on.
Get up here.
Come on, Andy.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.448
Go on.
Get up.
[laughing]

49:10.481 --> 49:12.283
Whoo!

49:12.317 --> 49:14.019
Shake your tail
feather, Andy !

49:14.052 --> 49:16.554
That's it.
Go on.
Aw.

49:16.587 --> 49:18.556
There he goes.
Whoo!

49:18.589 --> 49:20.658
[both laughing]

49:31.336 --> 49:33.338
* Well, a little birdie
told me *

49:33.371 --> 49:35.273
* Back in '32

49:35.306 --> 49:37.475
* A certain
crossroad stranger *

49:37.508 --> 49:39.444
* Made a pet of me

49:39.477 --> 49:42.147
* You're a voodoo lover

49:42.180 --> 49:43.781
* Gonna cast
your spell on me *
Come on.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.216
[mutters]

49:47.385 --> 49:49.320
You, too.
* And what's
got me worried *

49:49.354 --> 49:52.523
* I don't
wanna be set free *

49:52.557 --> 49:54.559
[chuckling]

[zipper unzips]

50:44.675 --> 50:46.577
[urinating]

50:52.750 --> 50:54.552
Never.
Listen to me.

50:54.585 --> 50:55.920
You will never make it
to Thailand.

50:55.953 --> 50:58.823
You won't even get a passport.
Ron's got friends
that can help us.

50:58.856 --> 51:01.392
But things are different now.
There's all sorts
of security checks.

51:01.426 --> 51:04.495
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Things have changed, Dale.

51:04.529 --> 51:09.434
Ron has murdered two people.
They're gonna catch up with you.

51:09.467 --> 51:11.402
[Dale]
Ron!

51:22.613 --> 51:25.716
Dale, listen to me.
Listen.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.353
You haven't done
anything wrong.

51:29.487 --> 51:32.423
Look at you. You're--

51:32.457 --> 51:34.592
You're beautiful.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.562
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

51:37.595 --> 51:41.766
You could turn yourself in
tomorrow and walk.

51:41.799 --> 51:44.835
Walk to what, Andy?

51:44.869 --> 51:47.238
Back to stripping?

51:48.473 --> 51:51.642
Ron-- He loves me
just the way that I am.

51:51.676 --> 51:53.478
But you don't love you

51:53.511 --> 51:55.413
the way you are.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.448
[Ron]
Boo!

51:57.482 --> 51:59.650
Found this outside, And.

51:59.684 --> 52:01.819
I thought you might
have lost it.

52:01.852 --> 52:05.690
Now, you reckon
an art critic did this?

52:05.723 --> 52:07.792
Or have you been up
to something naughty?

52:09.460 --> 52:10.928
She left me.

52:10.961 --> 52:12.463
Crap.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.533
She left me, Ron,
all right?

52:15.566 --> 52:17.502
Bullshit!

52:19.504 --> 52:22.307
She walked out
without any of her stuff--

52:22.340 --> 52:24.642
her clothes, her makeup.

52:24.675 --> 52:27.912
Now, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

52:27.945 --> 52:30.481
you show me a broad
that would do such a thing.

52:33.618 --> 52:36.754
She left me
because my father...

52:36.787 --> 52:39.824
paid her a great deal
of money to disappear.

52:41.292 --> 52:42.560
And she did.

52:42.593 --> 52:46.631
They met for lunch,
and I never saw her again.

52:50.568 --> 52:52.503
[clicking tongue]

52:52.537 --> 52:54.405
Fuck me dead.

52:54.439 --> 52:56.541
I thought my old man
was harsh.

52:56.574 --> 53:00.411
He always said
she was a gold digger.

53:00.445 --> 53:02.547
I guess she was.

53:07.585 --> 53:08.919
[imitates sobbing]

53:13.524 --> 53:15.593
[sighing]

53:15.626 --> 53:17.828
Well, this brought
the night

53:17.862 --> 53:20.631
to a rewarding end,
didn't it?

53:32.810 --> 53:36.314
[footsteps approaching]

53:39.650 --> 53:42.453
The way he keeps
all her stuff,

53:42.487 --> 53:43.554
it's fuckin' sicko.

53:43.588 --> 53:46.023
I think it's romantic,

53:46.056 --> 53:47.558
like Miss Havisham.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.560
Miss who?

53:51.329 --> 53:52.563
Forget it.

53:54.365 --> 53:56.734
I shot your boss's
fucking head off,
all right?

53:56.767 --> 53:58.969
I fucked up
my whole fucking life.

53:59.003 --> 54:01.372
Dale, have you ever
asked yourself once why?

54:01.406 --> 54:03.808
Because you owed
him money, Ron!

54:03.841 --> 54:05.510
I fucked him so you'd
have more time to pay.

54:05.543 --> 54:07.645
Yeah, and I killed him
to get you out of that.

54:07.678 --> 54:09.013
You want to get me
out of it?

54:09.046 --> 54:10.615
You could've just
paid him.

54:10.648 --> 54:13.484
Just paid him, Ron.

54:13.518 --> 54:15.586
[laughing]

54:15.620 --> 54:17.622
Is that right?

54:21.025 --> 54:24.895
You see, I seen you
talking on, Dale.

54:26.897 --> 54:28.799
And you know what?
I don't care.

54:31.636 --> 54:33.504
Because I know
you love me.

54:35.506 --> 54:36.407
Don't you?

54:40.478 --> 54:42.212
Do you love me, Dale?

54:46.083 --> 54:48.486
What do you think?

54:49.487 --> 54:51.689
I got to believe
you love me

54:51.722 --> 54:53.023
because if I don't,

54:53.057 --> 54:54.659
I might as well
shoot my head off

54:54.692 --> 54:56.694
right fucking now.

54:58.796 --> 55:02.367
Do you love me, Dale?

55:05.903 --> 55:07.572
[whispers]
Yes.

55:10.575 --> 55:12.042
Good.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.489
Instead of gawking
at this poor bitch,

55:24.522 --> 55:27.825
why don't you see
what's right in front
of your eyes? Hmm?

55:27.858 --> 55:29.494
What do you mean?

55:29.527 --> 55:31.929
[Ron]
What's around her neck?

55:31.962 --> 55:35.132
That must be
50 grand's worth.

55:35.165 --> 55:38.035
I reckon you could get him
to tell you where it is.

55:38.068 --> 55:39.504
You know?

55:41.672 --> 55:44.442
Turn him on
a little.

55:45.610 --> 55:47.378
Make him think
you're hot for him.

55:47.412 --> 55:48.546
Oh, Ron.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.548
What? You did it tonight
and you enjoyed it.

55:50.581 --> 55:52.517
We were just having
a bit of fun.

55:52.550 --> 55:53.884
Hey.

55:53.918 --> 55:55.753
I'm not saying
fuck him, Dale.

55:55.786 --> 55:58.923
I'm just saying,
you know,

55:58.956 --> 56:01.992
do what you did
every night at the club.

56:03.994 --> 56:06.864
Are you too good
for that now?

56:06.897 --> 56:09.834
Isn't that
what you wanted?

56:11.836 --> 56:14.439
[whispers]
Yeah.

56:14.472 --> 56:16.641
You're right.

56:18.643 --> 56:19.844
I'll just break
his fucking legs

56:19.877 --> 56:21.579
and he's gonna
cough it up soon enough.

56:21.612 --> 56:22.813
You fucking shit.

56:22.847 --> 56:25.550
And that way,
you can stay pure!

56:27.485 --> 56:28.586
I'll do it.

56:33.491 --> 56:35.760
[whispers]
That's my girl.

56:35.793 --> 56:38.128
Why are you
such an asshole?

56:40.130 --> 56:43.100
We're not
like him, Dale.

56:44.101 --> 56:46.103
We're different.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.988
Ron's going
to break your legs

57:04.021 --> 57:05.923
if you don't tell me
where her jewelry is.

57:08.626 --> 57:09.694
It's in the bank.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.597
How do I get it?

57:18.603 --> 57:20.505
I will tell you
on one condition.

57:20.538 --> 57:24.208
You get the money
and the jewelry,

57:24.241 --> 57:26.043
and then you call the police
and you disappear.

57:26.076 --> 57:29.580
[inhales, exhales deeply]

57:31.248 --> 57:33.183
You must think
I'm a bad person.

57:33.217 --> 57:36.554
We've all done bad things
when we're desperate.

57:36.587 --> 57:39.824
I'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

57:39.857 --> 57:42.493
How do I get it?
[whispers]
Promise.

57:42.527 --> 57:43.861
Ron will get it
out of you.
Promise me

57:43.894 --> 57:46.964
you'll take the money,
and you will go.

57:52.637 --> 57:54.271
Then I promise.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.508
[sighing]

under Gabrielle's name.

58:06.717 --> 58:08.586

No.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.734
Yep.

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:43.373
Your lipstick
should be lighter.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:44.842
It's fine.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.143
It's not right.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.678
It doesn't matter.

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:49.313
Gabrielle would never wear
that shade with that suit.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:51.716
As if they care
at the bank.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.351
I'll change it.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.986
Okay?

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.323

get it right.

Charlie some water?

I guess I don't have
to untie you now.

No.

Sit down.
No.

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:49.566
Sit the fuck down.
You're gonna kill me anyway.

Fuck you! Fuck you!
Sit down!

It's Frank Middleton.

Mr. Shepard?

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.475
All right, Frank.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.179
This will be the last time
that we do this.

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:37.848
Yes, Mr. Shepard.

01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:39.416
And your password,
please?

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:42.086
Restraint.
[phone beeps]

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.389
[drops phone]

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.424
Game's over, And.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.893
You don't have
to kill me.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.227
I got no choice.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.362
You don't have to do it.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:56.166
What about
if I told you

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.968
that I had
done something?

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:04.341
I've done things,

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.545
things that I can't
tell the police.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:15.452
So you have been
naughty, have you?

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:26.163
It's about my father.

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.234
He fucked her.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:31.401
What?

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:33.537
My father.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.640
Your father tumbled
your fiancÃ©e?

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.910
That's why he--

01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:43.013
he paid her off.

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:45.282
He wouldn't let us
get married.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:48.185
They were having
an affair.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:52.556
[laughing]

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.659
That's bad.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:58.662
I just don't know
if that's bad enough.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.965
I killed him.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.435
I killed my father.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.979
I paid a man

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:17.547
$100,000 in cash.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:21.418
They made it look
like an accident...

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:23.420
on his boat.

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:26.356
[chuckling]

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:30.360
He gave me a photograph.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.030
There's proof.

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:37.267
You could
take it with you,

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:40.304
and you wouldn't
have to kill me.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:43.040
You would always
have it over me.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.983
I'd like to see
this photograph.

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:54.651
[knocking]

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:57.654
Miss Martin to see you.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.524
Miss Martin.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.426
Come in.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.302
Just need you
to sign here.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:13.470
Sure.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.507
We've met before, I think.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.045
Have we?

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.780
Can't think where.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.482
It'll come to me.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.384
Always does.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.419
Come through.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.563
Let me know
when you're ready.

01:06:45.169 --> 01:06:46.570
Turn the light on.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.451
[Andrew]
This way.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:09.526
The photo's
behind those pipes,
under that brick.

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.828
Go get them.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.264
Can you untie me, please?

01:07:14.298 --> 01:07:16.400
[scoffs]

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:20.470
You see, I thought
we were becoming friends.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.406
But you fucked me over.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:26.443
So that'll be a no.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.747
Yeah?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.084
Well, I've been fucked over
my whole life.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:36.520
[Ron laughing]

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.488
[gunshot]

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.756
[Ron]
Shit!

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:42.359
Andy!

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:43.527
[muffled]
Andy!

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.529
[slams door]

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.797
Andy! Let me out!

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.135
Andy! Andy!

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:53.303
[Ron muffled]
Let me out! Andy!

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:06.316
Oh.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.532
[grunting]

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.453
[grunting]

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.937
You having
fun yet, Andy? Huh?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.439
I know I am!

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:21.758
[door closes]

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.930
Right.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:30.934
Okay, I forgive you.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.867
[Ron whistling]

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.704
[whistling]

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.584
You have been
a bad, bad boy!

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:24.988
[shouts]

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.693
[screaming]

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.728
[grunting]
Come here!

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.575
[gasping]
Oh, Mr. Shepard.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:47.644
Sergeant Widdens,

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.245
what a surprise.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.981
You all right,
Mr. Shepard?

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:54.017
Yes, sir.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.553
I've just been--
Sorry.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.289
Been cleaning up
out the back.

01:10:59.323 --> 01:11:00.390
Can I help you?

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:02.292
Well, uh,

01:11:02.326 --> 01:11:03.593
do you mind
if we come in, sir?

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:05.729
Uh, no, actually, as I
said to you yesterday--

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.464
I really think it's time
you let us inside, sir.

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:10.834
I-I appreciate that.
I would like to, but, um,

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:14.003
to be honest, I can't
have people in my home

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.505
because of my condition.

01:11:15.539 --> 01:11:17.073
All right.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.809
We came by because
two very large checks

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.878
have been drawn
against your account
in the last two days.

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.647
You aware of that?

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.516
Yes. Yes, um,

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.984
$20,000.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.520
Made out to cash.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.289
Yes, that's right.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:38.795
[Andrew]
Are you saying you
came by because the--

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:41.531
the bank contacted you?

01:11:41.565 --> 01:11:42.899
[Widdens]
They routinely
monitor these things,

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.370
and, uh, they couldn't
raise you on the phone.

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:52.308
[car approaching]

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.412
Shit. Shit.

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:07.457
[sets brake]

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:41.691
My fiancÃ©e,
Gabrielle Martin.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:43.593
Miss Martin.

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:46.062
Sergeant.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.932
Look at the state of you.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.602
Been cleaning up in the, um,

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:53.937
in the basement.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.740
Getting ready
for the painters.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.509
This place
is falling apart.

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:01.478
She's back for one day

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.846
and she's running
my life already.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.581
[Widdens]
I see.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:07.984
[Andrew]
Sometimes things
work out, don't they?

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.653
The, uh, cash withdrawals,

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:12.155
it's renovating money.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:14.991
Just want to make sure
you're all right, sir.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.627
Anyway,

01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:19.863
happy renovating.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.601
[both sighing]

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:27.837
[Andrew grunting]
Ron.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.873
[tape ripping]

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.933
Me and my old man,

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:59.135
we saw this big
fucking crash.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:03.172
Big semi just went right over
the top of a little Jap job.

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:05.675
There's a girl
stuck in the car.

01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:09.579
I would've been
about 15, I guess.

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.247
Car is so dead.
The ambos are on the way.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.816
And my dad,
he can't get in there.

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:14.484
So I says, "Hey, Dad.

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:15.819
I can fit,
I can get in there."

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:17.954
There's this
little gap, right?

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.056
I get in.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:23.259
Fuck me dead,
the girl's alive.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:27.497
I can just see her head,
her body's trapped in the car.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.634
She'd be about 25,

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:33.136
long, curly blonde hair,

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:35.972
pretty.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.574
She's got blood
on her forehead,

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:38.875
but she smiles, you know,

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:41.745
this big beautiful smile.

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:45.615
I said, "Are you okay?
Are you okay?"

01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:48.084
She's like,
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine."

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.987
So I keep her talking about
her dog and stuff, you know,

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.956
until finally,
we hear the sirens

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:56.225
and it's time
for me to get out.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.961
And she says to me,

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.264
she says, "Well, Ronnie,
my name's Sara.

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.899
"When I get out of here,

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:05.602
I'm going to give you
the best night you ever had."

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:09.072
Which to me, right,
I'm, like, 15,

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:11.307
so that's big news.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.110
So I get out feeling
pretty good, right?

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:17.547
Then finally, the firies,

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:18.848
they have the jaws of life,

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:21.918
and they open the doors,

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.253
and her body's not
connected to her head.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.624
Decapitated,
right?

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:31.260
After that, no one
looks me in the eye.

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:34.664
My old man, he just pretends
like it never happened,

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:37.567
like I'm crazy or something.

01:15:38.702 --> 01:15:43.640
Well, I knew her name
was really Sara.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:45.541
Isn't that spooky?

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:50.279
Anyway, Andy,
I'm telling you this story

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:53.349
because everything I ever had

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:56.920
has never been quite real.

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:58.655
It's just disappeared,
you know,

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:01.190
like-- like steam
off a grate.

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:06.663
Except for Dale.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:08.331
You see, she's real.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.334
[footsteps approaching]

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:19.676
[exhaling deeply]

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.845
I fucking love you.

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.650
Oh! We're on our way
to Thailand, baby!

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.754
Tell you what, though,
you had me worried.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:33.356
I thought the cops
might have picked you up.

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.759
Just took longer
than I thought.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:38.662
Now, be careful
with this, okay?

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:39.929
It's loaded.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.799
You don't want
to lose me at this point.

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:49.673
So you're just going
to leave him here?

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:50.807
[muffled screaming]

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.875
What are you doing, Ron?

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:53.409
Listen, Dale, it's
not a bad way to go.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.311
And pass me the tape,
will you?

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.846
Ron, you promised.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.148
I know, but that was
more of a little white lie.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:00.316
[muffled screaming]

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.285
You know that he had
his old man bumped? Huh?

01:17:02.318 --> 01:17:04.353
He's not just a babe
in the wood, Dale.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.222
Yeah, Gabrielle was
"writting" his old man,

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:07.824
so he had him
knocked off.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.759
How sick is that?
Now, the tape, Dale!

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:11.027
No!

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.261
Don't make me stand here.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:15.264
Let him go, Ron.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.903
Dale, we had no choice.

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:22.405
We have no choice.
We never did.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:24.708
[muffled groaning]
I don't want you to kill him.

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.409
You'd better make
a fucking choice right now

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:28.444
because there's gonna be
one dead prick in this room.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.413
Stop it!
Him or me, Dale?

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:31.748
Stop it, Ron!

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:34.250
Him or me, Dale?
Stop it!

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:36.085
[trigger clicks]

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.722

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.456
[panting]

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:17.927
Think of this as Dr. Ron's
instant phobia cure.

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:20.163
Now she's been in there
about five minutes.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.431
You get out there
and you turn that engine off,

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:26.770
or hell, we'll just pull her
to the house, won't we?

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.304
But if not,

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:30.306
well, you'll have
to live with that,
won't you?

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:34.778
The man who couldn't
walk across his own
backyard to save

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:36.279
[whispers]
his girl.

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:37.313
Go on, Andy.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:38.314
Come on, buddy!

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.483
Come on,
you pathetic prick!

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.185
Giddyup there, Andy.
Go on.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.419
Come on, Andy.
Go on.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.189
[grunting]
That's it!

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.490
Go on!
That's it, Andy.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:51.761
Go on, that's it.
That's it.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.898
You're nearly there, Andy.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.866
[groaning]
Aw, come on, And!

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.467
Get up!
[whimpering]

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:02.071
Don't you quit on me,
Andy, come on!

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.306
There we go!

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.274
[Ron laughing]
[grunting]

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:07.410
[grunting]
Oops!

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.379
Did I lock it?
Dale! Dale!

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:14.483
I'd make a bloody good shrink.
Don't you reckon, And?

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.086
Dale!

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.521
[grunting]

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:20.790
At least you tried.

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:23.292
Dale!

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:26.029
Hey, hey.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:11.307
Fucking love
this shit, Andy!

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:16.445
How long you reckon
she's got, buddy?

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:19.448
Three minutes or less?

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:20.984
She's dying, Andy.

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:25.588
You can run like
a bloody rabbit, Andy.

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:26.822
Hey!

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:33.930
Dr. Ron was spot on,
don't you reckon?

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.008
[tapping]

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.280
That's because
we're the same, Andy.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.385
Except...

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:58.521
I'm always
one step ahead.

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.556

Very good!

Come on, Andy!
[groans]

01:21:15.504 --> 01:21:18.041
Is that all you got, Andy?
You can do better--

01:21:22.946 --> 01:21:25.414
[laughing]

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.488
Put your back into it, Andy.

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:33.522
Do it.

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:38.361
[coughing]

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.896

the same, Andrew.

You gonna ring the cops?

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.379
I have to.

01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:12.715
I've got two dead bodies
on my property.

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:15.751
What about me?

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:20.556
I suppose you'll
do some time.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.591
You fucking shit.

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:24.560
It's not as if
the police aren't gonna

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:26.562
work out
what happened, Dale.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:28.497
I mean,
what are our options?

01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:31.434
I saved your life.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:33.469
Twice.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:42.545
Don't you mean
three bodies?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.182
Sorry?

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:48.484
What about your dad?

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:51.787
Isn't he buried out here?

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.590
Daddy's alive and well

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:57.560
and living in Melbourne.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:02.431
Wouldn't say we're exactly
on speaking terms, but...

01:25:02.465 --> 01:25:05.268
I didn't kill him.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.109
Say you love me...

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:21.617

would say it.

"I love you."

I love you.

I'm Dale, Andy.

Call me Andrew,
Gabrielle.

01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:59.388

Yes, but say it like
Gabrielle would say it.

Go on, say it.

01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:08.764
I...
Yes?

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:11.600
I want you.
Yes.

01:26:11.634 --> 01:26:13.369
I want you.
Yes.

01:26:14.537 --> 01:26:15.571
I want you.

[zipping]

01:26:37.593 --> 01:26:39.295
Do you know where she is?

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:42.665
No.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.300
Europe, I think.

01:26:46.502 --> 01:26:47.703
What if she comes back?

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:49.204
She won't.

01:26:50.373 --> 01:26:52.341
Doesn't she have family?

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.410
No, she lost touch
with them.

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:56.979
Do you know, I think she
even changed her name.

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:58.981
Don't worry.

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.550
She's gone.
