<i>In the criminal
justice system,</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:26.351
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:26.426 --> 00:28.894
<i>by two separate
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:30.862
<i>The police
who investigate crime,</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:33.660
<i>and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:33.733 --> 00:35.223
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:36.136 --> 00:38.434
Man, that toilet didn't
even have a guest list.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.234
Well,
those other people got in.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.570
Yeah, you come in a limo,
you get in.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.076
So, uh, we try the Milk Bar.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.238
I think I did the doorman.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.940
Well,
that's who he said he was.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.022
Whoever did it was in a hurry.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.154
Left his wallet.
Name's Nicolas lliescu.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.061
Lives on 28th St.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.123
What'd they kill him with,
a cheese grater?

01:08.201 --> 01:10.829
Dragged on the pavement.
High speed.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.333
Hit and run?

01:12.405 --> 01:13.838
Hit someone accidentally,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.102
you don't need to
shoot them twice in the head.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.269
<i>We got some witnesses?</i>

01:18.344 --> 01:20.107
Yeah.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.814
You girls see what happened?

01:29.322 --> 01:30.687
This car
just came out of nowhere

01:30.757 --> 01:32.384
with this guy
draggir alongside.

01:32.459 --> 01:33.790
Came from where?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.691
There.
Wrong way up 13th.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.627
It tore down here
and kept going.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.392
Did you get a look
at who was driving?

01:40.733 --> 01:42.860
White? Black?
Male? Female?

01:42.969 --> 01:44.129
No.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.899
How about the car?

01:46.172 --> 01:49.767
I don't know cars.
I mean, it wasrt real new.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.771
Was it a two-door
or a four-door?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.335
Light? Dark?

01:53.546 --> 01:54.604
Don't know.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.114
I'm gonna give you my card.

01:56.182 --> 01:59.674
If you remember anything,
I want you to call me, okay?

02:00.019 --> 02:01.111
What do you got?

02:01.187 --> 02:02.211
<i>Nada.</i>

02:02.322 --> 02:03.482
Could be the mob.

02:03.556 --> 02:04.853
Could be a carjacking.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.688
Could be a hack
who didn't like his tip.

03:31.644 --> 03:34.169
"Glass fragments from the
accident site inconclusive.

03:34.247 --> 03:38.183
"Autopsy shows two close
contact entry wounds to the head.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.049
"A 9-millimeter slug found at
the base of the skull."

03:41.120 --> 03:43.452
Lands and grooves
make it a Beretta. 92.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.616
Any ballistics match
on the computer?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.593
So with hot water and a shoe,
we could make soup.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.754
Okay. D.M.V. Shows
our Mr. Iliescu owned

03:51.831 --> 03:54.698
an '88 Pontiac Bonneville,
burgundy.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.727
It's hardly a color
won'th dying for.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.204
The wife is due at the morgue
in 15 minutes.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.332
Let's see what she knows.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.569
My family and I left
Hungary 30 years ago.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.342
We wanted to
get away of oppression.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.547
Nicolas and I left
Bucharest 10 years ago

04:12.619 --> 04:15.053
To get away of the violence.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.749
You said he was working late
on the books.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.382
Did he ever call?

04:19.459 --> 04:22.019
Yes, around, uh, 12:30.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.090
Leon doesn't sleep well.
He answered.

04:25.164 --> 04:28.759
I... I was too tired
to talk to him.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.564
All right, all right.

04:30.637 --> 04:31.968
What did your father say, Leon?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.539
He's not my father,
he's my uncle.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.837
He said he was on his way home.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.069
Just take a minute, all right?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.088
It's a mistake.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.487
Sometimes
you read about mistakes.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.990
I'm afraid it's not, ma'am.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.720
We found your husband's
ID on the body.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.818
No.

04:55.895 --> 04:56.953
I'm sorry.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.229
Car's been found.
Lower East Side.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.408
Piranas leave more.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.170
Piranas don't need
a daily C-note for crack.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.441
Were you able to
I.D. The car that did this?

05:15.515 --> 05:18.416
The paint pyrogram matched
a white acrylic enamel.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.951
Very widely used.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.953
The trunk was hit
pretty high, huh?

05:22.021 --> 05:24.319
Yeah.
Probably a truck or a van.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.550
It hits him.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.116
Before he even has a chance to
get out and check the damage,

05:28.194 --> 05:30.185
the bad guy comes in
the passenger side,

05:30.263 --> 05:33.061
and Mr. Iliescu is looking at
the business end of a Beretta.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.360
Bang bang.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.096
Autopsy says
one was a clear-through.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.298
We found the slug up here.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.500
It was right there.
We sent it to ballistics.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.669
Thanks.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.077
So he pushes Nick's body
out of the car

05:48.147 --> 05:49.739
and he drives off
with his prize.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.181
Yeah. Problem is,

05:51.250 --> 05:52.615
Nick gets caught
in the seatbelt

05:52.685 --> 05:54.949
and dragged for half a block.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.251
That's a lot of trouble,
for what?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.724
<i>Blue Book, this is $2,000,
minus a fencer's discount.</i>

06:00.793 --> 06:03.694
Hey, people get knocked off
for subway change.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.424
Maybe the guys
who stripped the car

06:05.498 --> 06:07.227
know how
it got into that alley.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.790
Yeah.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.031
Those seats have to be
in a chop shop somewhere.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.366
Yeah, all right.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.341
Well, thanks, anyway.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.002
Auto Crimes gave us a list

06:19.078 --> 06:21.376
of auto parts dealers
with priors.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.711
Must be over 400
auto body shops in New York.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.216
Any that didn't make the list?

06:25.284 --> 06:27.218
Pontiac Bonneville, '88.

06:27.286 --> 06:31.780
Yeah. No, no, not the 1-120s,
the 40-90s with the armrest.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.116
No? Thank you.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.524
Yeah, I'm looking for
a 1988 Pontiac Bonneville.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.893
Grey velour, driver's side
front bucket seats.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.693
Yeah,
model 40-90 with armrests.

06:39.766 --> 06:40.926
Is that too much to ask?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.366
Well, how about the seats?

06:43.436 --> 06:44.835
You do?

06:45.037 --> 06:46.527
Wait a second, are you sure?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.631
Because I called you
the day before yesterday,

06:48.708 --> 06:50.198
and you didn't have any.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.870
Just came in? I'm interested.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.674
I'm gonna be right down.
Thank you.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.873
What have you got?

06:55.948 --> 06:58.883
Morrie's Auto Wreckers,
107 East Fourth St.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.584
They also fit
the '86 and '87 models.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.350
Here, they're right over here.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.686
Came in this morning.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.125
Bring the vehicle in,
I'll install them cheap.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.693
How much to wipe off the blood?

07:11.764 --> 07:14.164
Blood? Come on.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.326
That's, uh, ice cream
or ketchup, uh.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.801
They had kids.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.395
Those kids would be orphans.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.599
Hey, the car was stripped
last night

07:22.675 --> 07:24.666
eight blocks from here.
The owner's dead.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.440
I knew you were blue
the minute you walked in.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.105
Be my guest. Take them.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.616
I'm gonna want some names.
Who'd you buy it from?

07:31.684 --> 07:33.845
I don't send these guys
Christmas cards.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.181
The deal's strictly
cash for parts.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.348
Listen,
you start poking around here

07:38.424 --> 07:39.721
or your deal's gonna be

07:39.792 --> 07:41.692
making license plates
for cigarette money.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.092
I don't know their names.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.823
They only come in
a couple of times.

07:44.897 --> 07:47.593
I worked on one guy's van.
Long hair.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.134
All right, come on, what else?

07:49.202 --> 07:50.863
You know, scars, tattoos, what?

07:50.937 --> 07:52.063
The other guy, uh,

07:52.138 --> 07:55.665
leather jacket with, uh,
safety pins and studs.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.178
On the back,
says "No Bozo Jam."

08:01.247 --> 08:02.942
<i>d Any situation d</i>

08:03.015 --> 08:04.915
<i>d Jump, you know what
I'm saying, boys d</i>

08:04.984 --> 08:07.976
<i>d Don't tell me
what you call your foursome d</i>

08:08.054 --> 08:09.851
<i>d That's your label,

08:09.922 --> 08:12.516
<i>d You're emotionally unstable,

08:12.592 --> 08:14.992
<i>d Your papa was a loser,
a stone-cold loser d</i>

08:15.061 --> 08:17.655
<i>d At least he
never kissed ass dd</i>

08:18.030 --> 08:20.123
I can hear it in my fillings.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.633
Doesrt anybody
jitterbug anymore?

08:23.603 --> 08:26.037
Hey, what's a guy do
to get served around here?

08:26.105 --> 08:28.096
Put a hole in his nose?

08:28.608 --> 08:32.135
Miss,
you ever hear of No Bozo Jam?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.643
This is the Dog and Razor Club.

08:34.714 --> 08:35.874
You like loser groups,

08:35.948 --> 08:38.246
try Tuesday amateur night
at Shriek.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.979
Uh, maybe from some,
uh, earlier gig?

08:43.322 --> 08:45.153
Here's their flier.

08:46.492 --> 08:48.653
Great.
Where do we find them?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.056
Oh, yeah.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.598
You know, Ronda used to
play sets with them.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.133
Where's Ronda?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.362
On percussion at The Hole.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.568
Dd

08:59.639 --> 09:01.573
You know,
I don't want it around

09:01.641 --> 09:03.165
that I played with No Bozo,

09:03.242 --> 09:05.107
because things
are happenir for me.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.475
<i>We'll try to keep it
out of Rolling Stone.</i>

09:07.647 --> 09:09.808
Two super dysfunctionals.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.511
They, uh, give a new meaning
to the word clueless.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.213
We want names.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.449
What about the guy
who wears the leather jacket?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.321
Skank. Wayne Jeffers,
the lead singer.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.526
Then there was, um...

09:23.129 --> 09:25.689
I... I don't... I don't remember.
He played bass.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.097
Any idea
where we can find them?

09:29.101 --> 09:31.467
Uh, if they haven't
won the lotto,

09:31.537 --> 09:33.437
they're squattir in
the Belmont Building

09:33.506 --> 09:35.667
over on Avenue D and Sixth.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.371
That's the same block
as where we found the car.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.467
Get your hands
behind your head!

10:06.539 --> 10:08.939
Lace the fingers together!
Spread your legs apart!

10:09.008 --> 10:11.101
Don't even think about it.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.402
Wayne Jeffers,
you're under arrest.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.707
What about the equipment?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.906
You're travelir light.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.642
No, he's not.
9- millimeter Beretta.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.085
Look, I told you.
The car was just there.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.145
We took what we could.
End of story.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.623
After you killed
Nicolas lliescu.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.957
I found the gun on the
front seat, passenger side.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.720
You found the gun
on the front seat

10:32.798 --> 10:35.426
and you didn't see his brains
splattered all over the dashboard?

10:35.501 --> 10:37.298
Yeah, yeah, I saw the
blood and the meat.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.462
It's a tough neighborhood.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.673
Someone ditched the car.
What do you want from me?

10:41.741 --> 10:44.471
We stripped the car seats and
the cassette decks for money,

10:44.543 --> 10:45.737
but we didn't kill anyone.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.439
Oh, sure.
And where did you get this?

10:48.881 --> 10:51.509
Come on, Skank, you can't
be as dumb as your haircut!

10:51.584 --> 10:53.745
We found this
in your pants pocket!

10:53.819 --> 10:55.719
It was under the seat.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.789
I thought it might
be good for something.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.518
Yeah, like grand larceny,

10:59.592 --> 11:02.083
which we're gonna add to
the theft and murder charge.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.788
How many times
I gotta tell you?

11:03.863 --> 11:06.559
We didn't kill anybody.
We just needed some cash.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.994
Slugs in the vic's skull
match the Beretta.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.333
His are the only prints on it.

11:13.539 --> 11:14.972
If I was gonna kill a guy,

11:15.041 --> 11:16.599
you think I'd do it
for a Bonneville?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.167
I think you'd do it
for a shoelace.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.946
Your buddy's prints
are on the gun.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.038
My guess is

11:23.115 --> 11:25.276
right now he's in the
other room rollir on you.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.909
That's a lie!

11:27.319 --> 11:29.651
I told you, we was performing.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.951
Let's try
a little remedial math, Skank.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.086
There's two of you,
but there's only one deal.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.062
Now, who's gonna get the deal,
you or him?

11:41.967 --> 11:44.595
Their alibi sings,
even if they can't.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.036
Uh, from midnight
to 6:00 a. m.,

11:47.106 --> 11:49.006
Moe and Larry
were poppir eardrums

11:49.075 --> 11:51.703
at a club called Dreck.
150 witnesses.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.007
Who would've thought these
clowns were tellir the truth?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.547
Hey, you're lookir for a patsy,

11:55.614 --> 11:57.741
what could be better than
dumpir the car and weapon

11:57.817 --> 11:59.148
in the middle of Junkieville?

11:59.218 --> 12:02.551
Yeah. The first vulture that
comes along gets booked for murder.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.111
The first vulture
without an alibi

12:04.190 --> 12:06.124
gets locked in a cage
for a very long time.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.420
These guys are smart.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.620
Well, but maybe
they werert so tidy.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.287
Righteous brother number one
claims

12:11.363 --> 12:13.024
he found this in the car.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.526
Mr. Brian Hollingswon'th.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.131
What, you think he was in a
hurry to get out and dropped it?

12:20.206 --> 12:22.106
So much for
leaving home without it.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.766
Check him out.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.381
Last week we came in low bid

12:29.448 --> 12:31.348
on office space
for a midtown law firm.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.748
Architect's dream.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.309
Bought a round of Stoli
at P.J.'s to celebrate

12:35.387 --> 12:37.116
and I paid for it with this.

12:37.189 --> 12:40.181
Yeah, well,
your name is also on this.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.993
That's my old number.
I had to cancel that card.

12:43.062 --> 12:45.121
Someone charged
$7,000 in merchandise.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.062
They said someone
had gotten my number

12:47.133 --> 12:48.464
and made a phony card.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.799
Have you ever heard of lliescu
Antique Furniture Store?

12:51.904 --> 12:54.304
Yes. My wife and I
bought a credenza,

12:54.373 --> 12:55.704
a French provincial,

12:55.775 --> 12:58.744
only our decorator said
it was actually Hungarian.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.369
And you bought it
with a credit card?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.708
No, they wouldn't take cards.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.043
I had to pay by check.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.707
I don't... I don't see
the connection.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.412
Nicolas lliescu, the owner,
was murdered

13:07.486 --> 13:10.011
and this card
was found in his car.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.025
Well, I'm not in
any kind of danger, am I?

13:16.495 --> 13:20.158
So he bought the credenza from
the guy who fakes his card?

13:20.666 --> 13:21.928
Yeah.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.492
But how did he fake the card
without seeir it?

13:25.771 --> 13:28.535
You know, I bought a
jacket two weeks ago,

13:28.607 --> 13:31.633
but my card was loaded,
so I wrote him a check.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.439
And you know what else?

13:33.512 --> 13:35.207
You had to give
two forms of I.D.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.182
Your driver's license
and your credit card.

13:40.619 --> 13:44.487
So we checked the bank that issued
Hollingswon'th's credit card.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.321
In the last six months,

13:46.392 --> 13:49.088
they had a dozen customers
complain of fraudulent charges.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.355
And of those 12,

13:50.429 --> 13:52.897
four of them bought furniture
from lliescu's store.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.057
All by check,

13:54.133 --> 13:55.862
and they all gave him
two forms of I.D.,

13:55.935 --> 13:57.300
one of which was a credit card.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.837
So lliescu copies the number,
prints up a phony card,

13:59.905 --> 14:01.566
and runs up a tab
all over town.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.540
What, you figure
the murder's related?

14:03.609 --> 14:05.736
Successful at one felony,
why not branch out?

14:05.811 --> 14:08.371
Could be he had a partner
and one of them got greedy.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.438
Okay, talk to his wife.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.046
Five years ago,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.951
we went back to Europe
for eight weeks.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.183
We sublet the apartment.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.260
Nickie wanted to declare
the income on our taxes.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.523
I said, "Who is gonna know?"

14:24.630 --> 14:26.359
He says, "I will."

14:26.866 --> 14:30.427
So there is no way
Nickie was involved in this.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.634
I know...

14:35.474 --> 14:36.907
I knew him.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.871
Did he gamble,

14:38.944 --> 14:40.502
or did he have
any other hobbies?

14:40.579 --> 14:43.241
He worked. He came home.
That's all.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.646
Ma'am, we do know

14:45.718 --> 14:47.743
the crime originated
in your store.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.653
Well, it was Nickie's store,
but other people worked there.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.883
Mrs. Iliescu,

14:53.092 --> 14:54.457
If you'd give us
your permission,

14:54.526 --> 14:56.824
uh,
we can look around the store.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.955
Nickie's brother, Alex,
should be there.

14:59.031 --> 15:01.465
Just tell him
I said it was okay.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.303
It was much easier
for the police in my country.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.398
Here, the police need things
like warrants.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.942
Well, we don't need one
when the owner consents.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.410
Ah, Karen.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.073
She's doing very well now,
under the circumstances.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.309
You worked for Nick for
a long time, didn't you?

15:18.384 --> 15:19.681
Mmm-hmm.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.817
You know,
I was like you in my country.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.489
A policeman.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.818
Now I fix chairs
for my baby brother.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.787
Detective,
there's a safe back here.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.164
Sometimes we are paid in cash.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.392
You mind?

15:34.466 --> 15:37.594
Tommy, open the safe
for these gentlemen.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.242
Tommy's a hard worker,
an honest man,

15:45.311 --> 15:48.439
something else you don't find
many of back home.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.239
Yeah,
there's not many here either.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.582
You really think
Nick was involved

15:53.652 --> 15:56.018
with this, uh,
credit card thing?

15:56.455 --> 15:57.683
Do you?

15:57.756 --> 16:00.623
Well, sometimes
business wasrt so great.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.556
See what I mean?

16:07.633 --> 16:10.124
What are these,
corporate ledgers?

16:10.202 --> 16:11.829
You're the cop.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.108
We checked the signatures

16:17.176 --> 16:18.768
on the time cards
in lliescu's store.

16:18.844 --> 16:19.902
And?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.412
That Jerry down the hall?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.574
He'll tell you a mars fingerprint
will divulge his entire personality

16:24.650 --> 16:26.811
You ask me,
that's a bunch of crap.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.183
Signature, that's
a horse of a different color.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.688
We just want to know
if any of these match.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.418
Well, look for yourself.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.221
See the "y" at
the end of Tommy?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.592
The angle of the upstroke
and how it's cut short?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.528
Now look at
the "y" in O'Malley.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.860
Close.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.332
You get that
close at the track,

16:42.401 --> 16:43.561
you retire early.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.229
So you're saying that
Tommy Zanescu forged these?

16:46.305 --> 16:47.294
Looks like it.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.307
Give me a full exemplar,
I'll know for sure.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.433
Thanks.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.374
Hey, we can pick him up now
on grand theft.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.413
And what, squeeze him
till he confesses to murder?

16:55.781 --> 16:57.009
Forensics says

16:57.082 --> 16:59.915
that lliescu's car
was rammed by a truck.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.078
Furniture stores
make deliveries.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.516
Are you kidding me?

17:05.590 --> 17:06.785
These guys are slave drivers.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.020
Me and Julio, sometimes
up to 10 deliveries a day.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.685
That's why I eat
so healthy, guys.

17:10.762 --> 17:14.392
A slice with some sausage is one
of your three basic food groups.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.093
Hey, you and Julio,
they don't make you

17:16.167 --> 17:17.692
lug pianos
uptown on your backs.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.863
Do me a favor. Don't give
them any ideas, all right?

17:19.938 --> 17:22.372
To save a buck, these guys'll
probably ditch the truck.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.136
What kind of truck, Hector?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.300
Ford. White.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.277
Anybody, uh, fix
the bumper lately?

17:27.346 --> 17:29.405
Hey, I haven't even seen
it in a couple of days.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.278
Tommy took it, um,
last Tuesday.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.318
And he never brought it back?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.114
Hey, do me a favor.
You find it,

17:35.187 --> 17:37.314
I'm in no rush, all right.
Know what I mean?

17:42.361 --> 17:47.321
O'Malley, Hollingswon'th,
Ford, Cohen.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.630
I don't know these people.

17:50.502 --> 17:51.799
That's funny,

17:51.870 --> 17:54.896
'cause you ran up
over $80,000 on their cards.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.407
I don't see my
client's name anywhere.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.410
Our handwriting expert tells us

17:59.478 --> 18:01.173
that he signed
every one of those.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.612
Handwriting expert?
What's next?

18:03.682 --> 18:05.115
Maybe you want
to read his palm?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.683
Or how about some tea leaves?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.777
I hear they're very good
for telling the future.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.185
Hey, you want to know
the future?

18:10.255 --> 18:11.483
Try 25 years in Attica.

18:11.557 --> 18:15.220
Hey, I don't know what F. Lee
Yahoo here told you, Tommy,

18:15.327 --> 18:18.490
but we got you for forgery
and grand larceny

18:18.564 --> 18:20.998
and that adds up to
a lot of years all by itself.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.795
And then when
you add murder two...

18:22.868 --> 18:24.927
You cannot tie me
to any murder.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.767
The delivery man told
us you took the truck.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.641
It's only a matter of
time until we find it

18:30.709 --> 18:32.176
and if we find any paint

18:32.244 --> 18:33.472
from Nick's car
on the bumper...

18:33.545 --> 18:35.308
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute, Lennie.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.780
Let Mr. Forrelli
here explain it to him.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.045
That's what you're
paying him for, right?

18:40.719 --> 18:42.653
We know there were two.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.722
Just tell us who
the other person was.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.122
Maybe we can work
something out here.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.786
I don't know if they
give out gold stars

18:50.863 --> 18:52.490
for loyalty in your country,

18:52.564 --> 18:55.328
but over here, all you get
is a set of striped pajamas

18:55.400 --> 18:57.834
and the word "schmo"
stamped on your forehead.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.770
The world's not as big
as you think it is, Tommy.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.607
We're gonna find your partner.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.839
The question you
have to ask yourself,

19:06.745 --> 19:08.906
will he be this loyal to you?

19:12.718 --> 19:14.345
You have authority to deal?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.113
We have the D.A.'s ear.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.051
Alex.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.817
Nick's brother?

19:25.464 --> 19:26.863
Nick found out.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.560
He searched the store,
found the forged cards...

19:29.635 --> 19:30.693
And you killed Nick

19:30.769 --> 19:32.361
to keep him from
going to the police?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.732
I thought we were just going
to get the cards back.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.173
I never thought
he'd kill his own brother.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.676
Where's the truck?

19:41.246 --> 19:45.444
In a rent-a-garage
on Corona, 108th St.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.053
You sure this is okay?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.622
The guy gave us the key,
didn't he?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.590
You know, I thought
something was wrong.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.456
Guy has a business in Manattan.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.290
Why does he want
a garage in Queens?

19:57.362 --> 19:58.989
White Ford van!

19:59.097 --> 20:00.689
Those two guys,
a guy could tell.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.790
You know what I mean.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.834
Yeah, thanks.

20:02.901 --> 20:03.959
Lennie!

20:08.307 --> 20:11.299
I wonder if he reported that
to his insurance agent.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.010
Burgundy paint.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.635
Just like
his brother's Bonneville.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.151
What's Romanian for
"You're under arrest"?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.625
This is a mistake.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.457
Sounds just like English.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.121
Alex lliescu,
you're under arrest

20:32.264 --> 20:33.856
for the murder of
Nicolas lliescu.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.559
You have the right
to remain silent.

20:35.634 --> 20:36.965
Anything you say can be used

20:37.035 --> 20:38.935
against you
in a court of law...

20:40.405 --> 20:42.771
"Docket number 651328.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.241
<i>"People v. Alexei Iliescu
on the charge</i>

20:45.310 --> 20:47.244
"of murder in
the second degree,

20:47.312 --> 20:48.506
"robbery in the first degree,

20:48.580 --> 20:50.445
and scheme to defraud
in the first degree."

20:50.515 --> 20:51.914
How does the defendant plead?

20:51.984 --> 20:54.179
I plead not
guilty to all counts.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.511
And the State's
response to Mr. Iliescu's

20:56.655 --> 20:58.714
sweeping
declaration of innocence?

20:58.991 --> 21:00.925
As a Romanian national, we feel

21:00.993 --> 21:03.461
Mr. Iliescu represents
a strong risk of flight.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.995
We ask he be held without bail.

21:05.063 --> 21:08.032
That's the message you send
to the emerging democracies?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.091
Bail is set at $500,000.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.227
Your Honor,
Mr. Iliescu struggles

21:12.304 --> 21:14.272
to earn a living in
a small furniture store.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.966
I appreciate his efforts

21:16.041 --> 21:17.372
in pursuit
of the American dream,

21:17.442 --> 21:19.876
but murder simply is
the wrong approach.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.617
I begged Nick not to let
Alex into the business.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.720
He could not
refuse his brother.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.825
This is how he repays Nick.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.861
I assure you, Alex will pay
for what he did.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.988
I read the papers, Mr. Stone.

21:40.332 --> 21:44.063
I see how difficult it is
to convict a criminal.

21:46.338 --> 21:47.362
I will help you.

21:47.439 --> 21:50.408
I will testify
on behalf of the State.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.901
But unless you have
specific evidence

21:52.978 --> 21:54.445
relating to the crime...

21:54.513 --> 21:57.380
My Nickie wasrt
the first he killed!

21:57.516 --> 21:59.643
You have knowledge
of other crimes?

21:59.718 --> 22:03.882
In Romania, Alex was
an officer in the Securitate,

22:03.955 --> 22:05.388
the secret police.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.189
He killed hundreds.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.384
I understand,

22:09.461 --> 22:12.055
but the court
may rule that inadmissible.

22:12.731 --> 22:13.891
Now, if Leon...

22:13.965 --> 22:15.865
Leon has nothing
to do with this.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.935
Nickie and I kept him away.

22:22.374 --> 22:26.310
We taught him
that here in America,

22:27.245 --> 22:29.577
the laws mean something.

22:30.882 --> 22:34.249
I hope we didn't taught him
wrong, Mr. Stone.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.421
Mrs. Iliescu,
please listen to me.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.122
In my opinion,

22:41.193 --> 22:43.991
we have sufficient
evidence to convict Alex.

22:51.636 --> 22:53.763
Hope you're not
making hollow promises.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.773
Kaplan just brought
this motion to suppress

22:55.841 --> 22:57.934
all the evidence
found in the garage.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.642
I'm a little surprised,
Mr. Stone. No warrant.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.216
It wasrt necessary, Your Honor.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.375
They had consent.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.612
From the wrong person.
You'll see on the lease

23:08.687 --> 23:10.587
Alex lliescu is the sole renter

23:10.655 --> 23:11.815
of the storage garage.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.085
Tommy Zanescu didn't have
authority to consent.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.786
They had joint authority,
Your Honor.

23:15.861 --> 23:17.761
I don't see any reference
to joint authority

23:17.829 --> 23:18.921
in this lease.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.295
Mr. Zanescu gave
the officers the keys.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.459
So what?
The janitor probably has keys

23:23.535 --> 23:25.469
to this office.
He can't consent to a search.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.472
Well, even if the officers
had made a technical mistake,

23:28.540 --> 23:32.636
<i>under Illinois v. Rodriguez
they still could search</i>

23:32.878 --> 23:35.506
with a good faith belief
that Mr. Zanescu

23:35.580 --> 23:37.673
had the apparent
authority to consent.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.274
If Justice Rehnquist conducted
the search instead of

23:40.352 --> 23:42.582
the New York Police,
you'd be right.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.485
But this state
requires some inquiry

23:44.556 --> 23:46.319
as to whether
the consenting party

23:46.391 --> 23:47.449
controls the property.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.323
So what should
the police have done?

23:49.394 --> 23:51.328
Reasonable inquiry
was easily available

23:51.396 --> 23:53.261
in a file cabinet
in the rental office

23:53.331 --> 23:54.593
just 100 feet away.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.724
Your Honor...

23:55.801 --> 23:57.962
Mr. Stone, I don't
much fancy the thought

23:58.036 --> 23:59.799
of the police searching my home

23:59.871 --> 24:01.429
because a suspected felon

24:01.506 --> 24:03.599
may give out
keys and a say-so.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.541
I'm declaring the truck
and all of the other evidence

24:07.612 --> 24:09.637
found in the garage
inadmissible.

24:09.714 --> 24:11.773
Thank you, Your Honor.
Considering

24:11.850 --> 24:13.681
the paucity of
evidence against my client...

24:13.752 --> 24:15.811
I'm one step ahead of you,
Mr. Kaplan.

24:15.887 --> 24:18.788
The case against
Mr. Iliescu is dismissed.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.355
I don't get it, Ben.
Don't you talk

24:23.428 --> 24:25.123
to our cops?
Apprise them of the law?

24:25.197 --> 24:26.289
They acted well

24:26.364 --> 24:28.195
within the boundaries
of normal procedure.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.826
They can't anticipate
the call of every judge.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.268
We still have Tommy Zanescu's
statement.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.771
The uncorroborated
testimony of a felon?

24:35.841 --> 24:37.900
Feeling masochistic this week?

24:38.109 --> 24:39.838
Judge Kleinfeldt is
not the only judge

24:39.911 --> 24:41.708
that likes
evidence in her courtroom.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.907
The manager of the garage
can ID Alex.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.012
Yes?

24:50.689 --> 24:51.815
When?

24:53.225 --> 24:55.022
Yes, they're in my office.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.123
Well, we're off the hook, boys.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.630
Alex lliescu has been called

25:00.699 --> 25:02.326
to answer before
a higher court.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.633
These three deep wounds
to the upper back

25:05.704 --> 25:07.069
should have been fatal.

25:07.138 --> 25:08.867
And the rest were just for fun?

25:08.940 --> 25:11.272
Man likes work, hard to get
him out of the office.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.901
This guy really got into it.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.605
Broken tip of the blade
was protruding

25:14.679 --> 25:16.044
from where it hit his rib.

25:16.114 --> 25:19.015
Looks like a boning knife
was the weapon of choice.

25:19.251 --> 25:22.482
You know, he might have took
a few swings with this.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.587
I want you to check
all the shards for prints,

25:25.657 --> 25:27.352
blood, whatever.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.861
It's obvious the man was
security conscious.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.729
Whoever got in was let in.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.062
Probably someone he knew.

25:37.135 --> 25:38.727
Kitchen knife.
Sounds domestic.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.675
Mrs. Iliescu,

25:46.745 --> 25:48.406
we'd like to ask
you some questions.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.914
It's about Alex lliescu's death.

25:55.954 --> 25:59.253
You promised us justice.
You released him.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.484
Aunt Karen.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.357
Leon, call the lawyer.
He's expecting it.

26:09.801 --> 26:10.768
Come on, Ben,

26:10.835 --> 26:12.803
let's share a little
responsibility here.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.202
Responsibility, Jonathan?

26:14.272 --> 26:15.364
I didn't stab anyone.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.668
Your life wasrt in danger

26:16.741 --> 26:18.902
from a stone-cold killer
that you released.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.569
He was killed in his apartment,

26:20.645 --> 26:22.545
not breaking into her house.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.481
<i>Texas, Ben. The Burning Bed.</i>

26:25.584 --> 26:26.778
The law has held that

26:26.851 --> 26:28.216
self-defense
can be pre-emptive.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.083
The danger doesn't
have to be imminent.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.487
For a battered wife killing
an abusive husband.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.184
Alex lliescu never
laid a hand on her.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.987
He made her a widow.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.824
They will also
hear how this woman

26:37.896 --> 26:39.989
pleaded with this
prosecutor for protection.

26:40.065 --> 26:43.228
Mrs. Iliescu,
if you were so afraid,

26:43.301 --> 26:44.768
why didn't you call us?

26:44.836 --> 26:45.928
You let him go.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.972
Why should I believe
you would have helped us?

26:48.039 --> 26:49.939
If you were so
anxious to help her then,

26:50.008 --> 26:51.703
help her now.

26:51.876 --> 26:54.344
Man two with
a suspended sentence.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.310
Man two,
she serves the maximum.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.877
She'll never serve a day, Ben.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.980
I'll see you in court.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.548
Unless they
rewrite the statute,

27:07.626 --> 27:09.560
self-defense
requires imminent danger.

27:09.661 --> 27:12.027
Juries deal in equities,
not statutes.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.894
This guy killed thousands.

27:14.199 --> 27:16.099
Shapiro will talk
the jury into thinking

27:16.167 --> 27:17.759
the killing was
a public service.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.202
We have a problem.
Karen lliescu's confession

27:20.271 --> 27:21.397
doesn't match the evidence.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.497
What evidence?

27:22.574 --> 27:25.304
The blood on the bottle
Alex used to defend himself

27:25.377 --> 27:27.174
doesn't match his or Karers.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.475
So she confessed to a crime
she didn't commit.

27:29.547 --> 27:31.276
She's protecting someone.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.579
Who's left? The boy.

27:35.620 --> 27:37.247
Call Briscoe and Logan.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.123
When we brought Leon
back from Romania,

27:45.230 --> 27:48.393
he lived with us like a son.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.728
I wanted him to have
a normal life.

27:53.738 --> 27:55.069
He deserved it.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.541
He murdered his father,
Mrs. Iliescu.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.703
In terms of a normal life,
he's off to a bad start.

28:00.779 --> 28:03.407
Take into account
what his father was,

28:03.481 --> 28:05.813
the fear his father
inspired in him.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.283
I'm going to
plead Leon not guilty

28:08.353 --> 28:09.877
by reason of mental defect.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.785
Insanity?
Come on, Jonathan.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.084
Based on what?

28:13.158 --> 28:15.490
His family, specifically Leon.

28:15.827 --> 28:16.987
He's been haunted,

28:17.062 --> 28:19.860
severely damaged by
a very terrifying past.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.789
Back to Romania.

28:23.802 --> 28:24.962
You were not there.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.936
You haven't seen
what I've seen.

28:27.005 --> 28:29.235
And what he saw,
the jury will see.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.707
And they'll know that Leon did

28:31.810 --> 28:34.506
what his life in Romania
conditioned him to do.

28:34.779 --> 28:36.474
It's cultural insanity.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.072
No judge is gonna buy that.

28:38.149 --> 28:41.243
Well, look, you're so sure,
make a motion to preclude.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.388
You think
he actually has a chance

28:50.462 --> 28:51.952
with this cultural
insanity defense?

28:52.030 --> 28:54.658
I think he has a knack
for creating things.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.695
There's nothing he likes better

28:57.769 --> 28:59.737
than making new law.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.271
But taken to the extreme,

29:01.339 --> 29:02.601
this defense would mean

29:02.674 --> 29:04.505
that nobody's
responsible for anything.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.477
Yeah, and that's exactly
where the law's heading.

29:07.946 --> 29:10.141
Something wrong,
someone to sue.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.682
That's civil law, not criminal.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.742
You think anyone knows
the difference or cares?

29:14.886 --> 29:16.513
Shapiro's raising the defense.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.352
Translation,
we take it seriously.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.551
Now, what about Liz?
She talk to the boy?

29:21.626 --> 29:22.854
No. This afternoon.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.555
Well, if she has any doubts,
cut a deal.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.765
I remember my mother.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.732
She take me to
the State Building.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.331
She, uh, has to see
the physician,

29:37.408 --> 29:40.969
so she, uh, leave me
with my father.

29:41.579 --> 29:43.274
He worked for the State.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.243
How old were you, Leon?

29:46.851 --> 29:48.842
Um, maybe 11, 10.

29:50.455 --> 29:54.551
The sergeant, he, uh,
take me to my father.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.424
He was in the quadrangle
outside the cell block.

30:00.765 --> 30:04.394
The prisoners, they were

30:04.469 --> 30:06.960
chained together at the ankles

30:07.272 --> 30:08.500
and they had to watch,

30:08.573 --> 30:10.040
or the guards would beat them.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.801
What did they have to watch?

30:13.478 --> 30:17.175
Another prisoner on the ground.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.509
He, uh...

30:20.051 --> 30:23.043
The guards stand on his arms

30:23.121 --> 30:25.021
so he cannot move.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.418
His feet are tied to a post.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.093
A big man,

30:33.264 --> 30:37.462
he is beating on the soles

30:37.535 --> 30:39.969
of the prisoner's
feet with a club.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.943
The big man turn around.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.572
It was my father.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.844
How did you feel about that?

30:53.084 --> 30:54.517
I was proud.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.444
Proud of his brutality?

31:02.193 --> 31:03.785
We got respect.

31:06.464 --> 31:10.332
We live well because of
what my father did.

31:12.470 --> 31:15.303
Every time
Ceausescu give an address,

31:15.807 --> 31:17.604
there is my father,

31:17.675 --> 31:19.939
the fourth man on his right.

31:25.083 --> 31:29.383
He said when I am grown,
that would be me.

31:32.123 --> 31:33.920
He was raised with
violence and brutality

31:33.992 --> 31:35.016
as a fact of life.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.082
It had to have an effect.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.991
I wasrt exactly invited
to the Queers tea

31:38.062 --> 31:39.086
when I was a kid.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.461
I didn't kill anybody,
and I don't think I'm insane.

31:41.532 --> 31:42.556
But figuratively,

31:42.634 --> 31:44.431
Leon was invited
to the palace ball.

31:44.502 --> 31:45.969
He saw his father's cruelty,

31:46.037 --> 31:48.096
and he also saw him
get rewarded for it.

31:48.172 --> 31:50.072
He became what his
culture prescribed.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.108
He couldn't reject
his father's life.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.144
So Shapiro's theory is valid?

31:54.212 --> 31:55.440
In theory, yes.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.811
What bothers me
is not so much what Leon says,

31:57.882 --> 31:59.543
but the way
in which he says it.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.278
He's reciting
a litany of horrors

32:01.352 --> 32:02.614
he experienced as a youth,

32:02.687 --> 32:04.484
but there's a weird enthusiasm

32:04.555 --> 32:06.523
as if he's describing
the actualization

32:06.591 --> 32:07.683
of some fantasy.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.283
Does he have a mental defect?

32:09.360 --> 32:10.827
I'd be able to testify that

32:10.895 --> 32:13.830
although he may have been
traumatized as a youth,

32:13.898 --> 32:15.297
he knew exactly
what he was doing

32:15.366 --> 32:16.765
when he killed his father.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.167
You will hear
a taped confession

32:23.241 --> 32:26.301
in which Leon lliescu describes

32:26.911 --> 32:31.314
plunging a knife repeatedly
into his father's back.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.717
And he doesn't say
that his act is justified.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.185
What he does say

32:36.254 --> 32:40.588
is that because of his youth
in a violent police state

32:41.259 --> 32:43.489
he cannot be held
legally responsible

32:43.561 --> 32:44.550
for his acts.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.561
He is legally insane.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.763
In short, Leon is saying,

32:49.834 --> 32:53.099
"I'm not guilty.
Society made me do it."

32:54.505 --> 32:55.972
I only ask that

32:56.040 --> 32:58.975
when you are confronted
with this mountain

32:59.043 --> 33:01.511
of psychoanalytic verbiage

33:02.413 --> 33:06.679
that you keep in mind
the real victim of this crime

33:07.251 --> 33:10.618
found on the floor
of his own apartment

33:11.122 --> 33:13.613
with the blade
of a boning knife

33:13.725 --> 33:15.784
broken in his back,

33:15.860 --> 33:18.055
murdered by his own son.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.130
Only then can you determine

33:22.600 --> 33:26.092
whether Leon
is the victim of society

33:26.237 --> 33:28.899
or society
is the victim of Leon.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.673
My father, God bless him,

33:33.945 --> 33:37.005
had a little tailor shop
right down here on Church St.

33:39.484 --> 33:40.781
When I was 5 years old,

33:40.852 --> 33:42.547
he made me sit behind a counter

33:42.620 --> 33:44.315
and talk to the customers.

33:44.422 --> 33:47.823
When I was 10, he taught me
to use the press.

33:48.893 --> 33:51.020
At 12, the sewing machine.

33:51.896 --> 33:54.831
To him, there would be
nothing greater in this world

33:54.899 --> 33:58.300
than to hang a sign,
"Shapiro and Son."

34:03.007 --> 34:07.239
You will see that it was
the same for Leon lliescu.

34:09.013 --> 34:12.176
Only his father made him watch
public executions.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.746
He taught him how to use
a pistol and a whip.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.178
The only path to
success for Leon

34:18.322 --> 34:20.347
was
State-sanctioned brutality.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.522
Then suddenly, he was brought
to this country.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.127
His aunt and uncle tried
to salvage

34:29.199 --> 34:30.724
the human being in him.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.460
They taught him that

34:32.536 --> 34:34.164
his father's way of life
was wrong.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.504
But then his uncle
was murdered by his father,

34:38.576 --> 34:40.942
and the State said it was okay.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.181
And something
inside of Leon went snap.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.514
He lived with us
the last seven years.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.687
Please describe
anything in Leors behavior

34:55.760 --> 34:59.196
that would lead you to believe
that he had a mental problem.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.060
He did not sleep well.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.463
And that's all?

35:02.567 --> 35:04.432
I don't want to
talk about Leon.

35:04.502 --> 35:06.299
I don't want to be here!

35:07.138 --> 35:09.197
Did any of his teachers...

35:10.808 --> 35:13.538
Did they complain
about his behavior?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.871
He had trouble in school.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.079
But I helped him.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.586
Mrs. Iliescu, that is not
an answer to my question.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.817
Did his teachers complain
about his behavior?

35:30.528 --> 35:32.359
Answer the question.

35:32.897 --> 35:33.955
No.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.329
And did he ever
get into any fights

35:36.400 --> 35:37.833
in the neighborhood?

35:39.370 --> 35:40.428
No.

35:41.038 --> 35:43.006
Was there anything
in his behavior

35:43.074 --> 35:44.336
that would lead you to believe

35:44.408 --> 35:46.433
that he needed
psychiatric treatment?

35:50.815 --> 35:51.782
No.

35:51.849 --> 35:52.873
Thank you.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.623
At what point
in the seven years

36:02.693 --> 36:04.058
that he lived with you

36:04.128 --> 36:07.791
did Leon begin to need help
with his schoolwork?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.858
He was a good student

36:11.836 --> 36:14.532
until his father
came over from Romania.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.229
Was that about the time

36:17.341 --> 36:18.808
he started having
trouble sleeping?

36:18.876 --> 36:21.674
Yes. He had nightmares.

36:22.613 --> 36:24.410
His friends would call,

36:24.482 --> 36:27.178
and he would not speak to them.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.987
Mrs. Iliescu,
you never consulted

36:31.055 --> 36:33.114
a psychiatrist
about Leors condition.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.920
Did you consult anyone?

36:37.495 --> 36:39.827
Yes, I spoke to Father Popescu.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.057
I begged Leon

36:44.402 --> 36:47.337
to come with me to church,
but he refused.

36:47.805 --> 36:51.138
He said he was cursed.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.010
God didn't want him.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.015
I would have done...

37:07.625 --> 37:09.354
anything for him.

37:12.163 --> 37:16.122
He lived with us
like our own son.

37:18.569 --> 37:22.903
But when Alex came,
I just felt him

37:24.308 --> 37:25.832
to... to slip away.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.139
He speaks of

37:31.215 --> 37:33.149
being almost constantly
at his father's side,

37:33.217 --> 37:35.242
of witnessing interrogations

37:35.319 --> 37:37.480
in which prisoners
were severely beaten.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.352
He saw executions.

37:39.490 --> 37:42.254
He also saw his father
rewarded for his actions.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.519
Unconsciously,
he equated cruelty

37:44.595 --> 37:47.189
with success,
achievement, and power.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.598
And in your expert opinion,
were these acts of violence,

37:50.668 --> 37:52.295
which he described vividly,

37:52.370 --> 37:54.702
were they the result
of his upbringing?

37:54.772 --> 37:57.002
His childhood
probably was traumatic,

37:57.074 --> 37:59.338
but it did not compel
him to kill his father.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.275
And does the defendant suffer
from any mental defect?

38:02.346 --> 38:03.370
No.

38:03.481 --> 38:06.609
So in your opinion
he is not legally insane?

38:06.717 --> 38:08.446
No, he's not.

38:08.519 --> 38:09.850
Thank you.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.495
Dr. Olivet.

38:19.330 --> 38:23.096
Would you, uh, consider
psychology an exact science?

38:23.167 --> 38:26.102
Psychological evaluation
offers a certain accuracy

38:26.170 --> 38:28.434
within certain parameters, yes.

38:28.506 --> 38:31.236
You described the effect
of Leors youth

38:31.309 --> 38:32.571
as traumatic, didn't you?

38:32.643 --> 38:34.804
I said it was
probably traumatic.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.578
Probably.

38:38.683 --> 38:42.642
In other words, it could be
as little or as much

38:42.720 --> 38:45.314
as anyone in your profession
cares to make it.

38:45.389 --> 38:49.223
No. We're not talking about
black magic, Mr. Shapiro.

38:49.293 --> 38:50.590
The evaluation process

38:50.661 --> 38:52.925
is based on
very specific criteria.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.555
I see.

38:54.632 --> 38:57.999
How many Romanians have you
evaluated in your career?

38:58.069 --> 38:59.195
None.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.067
How many sons
of mass murderers?

39:01.138 --> 39:02.435
Objection, Your Honor.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.768
We have already established

39:03.841 --> 39:05.638
Dr. Olivet's credentials
as an expert.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.042
I am not
challenging her expertise.

39:08.112 --> 39:10.478
I am questioning
the basis for her opinion.

39:10.781 --> 39:13.341
I'll allow it.
Answer the question.

39:14.585 --> 39:15.745
None.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.217
So tell us, Doctor,

39:19.290 --> 39:21.986
what in your past qualifies
you to form an opinion

39:22.059 --> 39:23.720
about the effect
of these horrors

39:23.794 --> 39:26.388
when you admittedly
have no experience?

39:26.464 --> 39:27.795
Objection.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.298
Withdrawn.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.797
It wasrt easy, Adam,
but I thought Liz

39:31.869 --> 39:33.632
held her ground
as best she could.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.264
Yeah. The problem is
juries go with the expert

39:36.340 --> 39:38.103
with the most letters
after his name.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.006
And Shapiro's putting
Dr. Melvin Diener

39:40.077 --> 39:41.101
on the stand.

39:41.178 --> 39:43.476
A curriculum vitae like
B.F. Skinner.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.777
The man coined
the term "cultural insanity"

39:45.850 --> 39:47.613
in his 500-page
treatise on the subject.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.518
And Jonathan Shapiro's
slick enough

39:51.655 --> 39:53.987
to beat you
through a revolving door.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.821
You actually think
a jury'll buy that?

39:55.893 --> 39:58.054
Well, if it does, we'll have
to triple the budget

39:58.129 --> 40:00.723
to prosecute all the
culturally-insane defendants.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.823
But if I cut
a deal with the boy now,

40:02.900 --> 40:04.731
it'll open the same floodgates.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.930
The boy says he's a product
of a screwed-up culture.

40:08.672 --> 40:10.105
Since when do we take

40:10.174 --> 40:12.574
the statement
of a known felon as gospel?

40:12.643 --> 40:14.634
The only way to get
a witness to discredit him

40:14.712 --> 40:16.612
is to fly one
over from Romania.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.671
I doubt the State
will spring for that.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.614
It may cost us only cab fare.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.311
Tommy Zanescu
hasn't been transferred

40:22.386 --> 40:23.910
out of Rikers yet.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.080
In my country,

40:25.156 --> 40:27.454
a can'ton of cigarettes
would get you a wool sweater.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.220
The problem is, I don't smoke,

40:29.293 --> 40:30.783
and I'm not cold.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.954
We are willing to
reduce the sentence.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.156
How much?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.165
That depends
on what you tell us.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.200
What do you want to hear?

40:39.470 --> 40:42.166
Enjoy the next 15 years
in jail, sir.

40:42.473 --> 40:46.136
Hold it.
I'll tell you what I know.

40:48.512 --> 40:52.380
Yeah, I knew Alex
back in Bucharest.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.111
I worked with him
in Securitate.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.210
I was what you people call
his right-hand man.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.811
Then you saw him around Leon?

40:57.888 --> 41:00.516
Hardly ever.
Alex had no use for Leon.

41:00.591 --> 41:01.956
He called him a mouse.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.220
How did Leon react

41:03.294 --> 41:05.285
when his father
brought him to the prison?

41:05.362 --> 41:07.887
The prison?
Is that what the boy told you?

41:07.965 --> 41:10.195
Alex wouldn't
bring him anywhere.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.800
When he was 5 years old,

41:11.869 --> 41:14.463
he sent him to the country
to live with servants.

41:14.538 --> 41:17.507
When Leon asked him to come
live with him in Bucharest,

41:17.575 --> 41:20.373
Alex shipped him off
to New York to his brother.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.537
So Leon always
hated his father?

41:22.613 --> 41:26.640
No. He was weak
and stupid and desperate.

41:26.851 --> 41:29.217
He'd do anything
to please Alex.

41:29.286 --> 41:30.344
What could he do?

41:30.421 --> 41:31.945
Alex didn't want to know him.

41:32.857 --> 41:34.722
But Leon still tried.

41:34.992 --> 41:38.155
You know, it was him
who told us that Nicolas

41:38.229 --> 41:41.096
was going to turn Alex in
to the police.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.894
Alex laughed and said,

41:42.967 --> 41:45.800
"See? You even
squeal like a mouse."

41:46.504 --> 41:49.166
By telling Alex that Nick was
onto the credit card scam,

41:49.240 --> 41:51.572
he was trying to buy his way
into his father's life.

41:51.642 --> 41:53.667
He knew Alex would do
something to stop his uncle.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.939
Which means the death of his
uncle wasrt traumatic.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.105
It was expected.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.240
This whole insanity
defense is a hoax.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.784
So call Shapiro
and set up a meeting.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.619
Zanescu is lying.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.490
He's lying.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.223
Um, Leon, did you
know Tommy Zanescu

42:13.297 --> 42:15.561
when you were both in Romania?

42:15.966 --> 42:18.400
He says he was your father's
right-hand man

42:18.469 --> 42:19.595
in the Securitate.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.433
He was just a chauffeur.

42:21.505 --> 42:23.939
My father had many chauffeurs.
Others who could tell you

42:24.008 --> 42:25.566
he wanted me to be with him,

42:25.643 --> 42:27.076
and none of them
would betray me

42:27.144 --> 42:29.374
or my father like
this Tommy Zanescu.

42:29.446 --> 42:32.244
Your father was not
an easy man to betray, was he?

42:32.316 --> 42:33.806
That's right.

42:36.253 --> 42:37.880
But your uncle?

42:41.425 --> 42:45.725
You found it easy to
betray him, didn't you?

42:46.530 --> 42:48.964
You went to your father,
and you told him

42:49.033 --> 42:50.967
that your uncle was
going to turn him in.

42:51.035 --> 42:55.028
No. Leon,
tell them you didn't.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.567
And you knew

42:56.640 --> 42:58.801
that your father killed
betrayers, didn't you?

42:59.343 --> 43:01.243
I didn't know
he would kill Uncle Nickie.

43:01.312 --> 43:05.248
You knew, Leon.
How could you?

43:05.416 --> 43:06.883
He was my father!

43:07.017 --> 43:08.951
But you loved Nickie!

43:12.122 --> 43:14.955
Yes. I loved him.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.889
If you had come to us,

43:17.962 --> 43:20.055
your uncle would
be alive today.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.164
After Uncle Nickie died,

43:29.573 --> 43:31.040
my father...

43:33.310 --> 43:35.676
he put his arm on my shoulder.

43:35.879 --> 43:38.939
He talked to me like a son.

43:39.717 --> 43:42.652
Until the charges
were dismissed against him.

43:45.923 --> 43:47.982
I went to his apartment.

43:48.425 --> 43:51.155
He was drinking,
celebrating. He...

43:52.596 --> 43:56.157
We talked about me
moving in with him.

43:56.233 --> 43:58.633
But he didn't want you, did he?

43:59.203 --> 44:00.261
He loved me.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.271
He didn't love you,
he used you.

44:02.339 --> 44:03.533
You don't know anything.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.438
I know he called you mouse.

44:11.415 --> 44:13.849
Is that because
you're a coward?

44:16.220 --> 44:18.211
I wasrt afraid of him.

44:24.728 --> 44:26.059
He was

44:28.899 --> 44:31.390
eating sausage like

44:33.170 --> 44:34.398
a pig.

44:37.875 --> 44:39.672
There was a knife.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.035
I pick it up.

44:45.749 --> 44:47.649
He just look at me

44:49.186 --> 44:50.676
and laugh.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.851
He call me a snitch

44:58.462 --> 45:00.521
and then he turn away,

45:01.899 --> 45:03.628
like I'm nothing!

45:09.306 --> 45:11.866
But I just keep stabbing

45:11.942 --> 45:14.103
until he doesn't move

45:14.745 --> 45:16.076
anymore.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.121
I'm not a coward.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.459
Extreme emotional disturbance,
Ben.

45:40.471 --> 45:42.462
Man one.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.582
Leon went a long way

45:57.688 --> 45:59.121
trying to win
his father's love.

45:59.189 --> 46:01.783
From the sound of it,
it wasrt won'th winning.

46:01.859 --> 46:03.588
They say a boy
doesn't become a man

46:03.660 --> 46:05.287
until his father passes away.

46:06.697 --> 46:09.495
Leon took care of it
in one fell swoop.
