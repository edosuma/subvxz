01:29.800 --> 01:33.793
Bud, you said tonight
was going to be special...

01:34.000 --> 01:37.356
...but all we've done
is watch bass fishing.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.514
April, this is special.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.598
This is Bassapalooza.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.159
Okay, I admit it.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.635
I had another reason
for asking you here tonight.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.955
Will you go with me
to the spring formal at Trumaine?

02:00.200 --> 02:02.350
- That'll be great.
- You don't have to apologize.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.630
I don't even know why--

02:05.680 --> 02:07.318
- You'll go?
- Yeah.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.157
Well, why?

02:11.680 --> 02:14.911
Bud, I've liked you from the first time
you walked up to my window...

02:15.120 --> 02:16.473
...at Mrs. D'Arcy's bank.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.069
You weren't one of those jerks
who carries quarters...

02:19.280 --> 02:21.271
...in their front pocket
just to impress me.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.753
How immature.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.557
One thing, though. Do not tell
Mrs. D'Arcy about the dance.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.832
Friday she's giving me
my final teller-trainee exam.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.190
If she hears I'm gonna ditch it,
she'll kill me.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.038
I won't say a word.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.869
- See you on Friday?
- Yeah.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.950
I did it, Buck. I got a date, boy.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.156
<i>You call that a date?</i>

03:07.920 --> 03:10.957
<i>Meet me and the Johnson's schnauzer
behind the 7-Eleven tonight...</i>

03:11.160 --> 03:12.991
<i>...and I'll show you a date.</i>

03:14.600 --> 03:17.478
Daddy, thank you for a great meal.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.518
Yep, I love the Beef Bistro.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.473
How many places are left
if you don't want the vegetable...

03:30.680 --> 03:33.069
...they substitute another steak?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.749
Now, Al, don't go to sleep.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.188
You know our deal.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.437
When you get beef, I get beef.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.870
Peg, when you get beef,
I get the heebie-jeebies.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.478
Mom, I have big news.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.716
I just asked April
to my spring formal.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.439
And she said no.

03:54.640 --> 03:58.235
Honey, you don't have to explain.
It's okay.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.955
What you need right now
is a nice hot cup of cocoa.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.357
Al, make the boy some cocoa.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.633
Well, I guess you're not getting
any cocoa...

04:13.880 --> 04:17.077
...but then again,
I'm not getting any beef.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.595
Mom, where you going?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.473
Upstairs to get
some Hamburger Helper.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.516
- This is Oliver Cole--
- And Mark Campbell.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.951
--here on the voice
of Trumaine College, W-H-I-P Radio.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.311
And for those of you on
the football team, that spells "whip."

04:38.840 --> 04:40.398
<i>This is The Mark and Oliver Show...</i>

04:40.600 --> 04:44.798
...where our motto is, "Together,
we're still not as fat as Rush Limbaugh."

04:46.280 --> 04:49.113
Now, remember, we're gonna be
giving away free limo service...

04:49.320 --> 04:50.992
...to this Friday's spring formal...

04:51.200 --> 04:54.590
...to the student with the most
pathetic reason for wanting it.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.909
You're on the air.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.510
<i>- Yeah, this is Bud Bundy, I'm trying--
- Bud Bundy?</i>

05:01.480 --> 05:03.516
We have our winner.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.308
Tune in Saturday for our informative
interview with Trumaine's new dean.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.994
Informative?
Hell, it's gonna be pure sleaze.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.310
We've dug up enough dirt
on this mystery man...

05:17.520 --> 05:20.353
...to make a luau pit
for Anna Nicole Smith.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.595
- We have?
- Yes. We have.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.878
Mark, you can't slander the dean
like this. You could get expelled.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.796
You're right. Where the heck would I be
without you, buddy? Thanks.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.873
Remember, folks, my partner Oliver
will be dissing the dean...

05:38.080 --> 05:40.116
...right after
the Trumaine basketball game...

05:40.320 --> 05:43.869
...featuring the debut of our Chechen
superstar center, Nickolai Pushkin.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.514
He's big. He's bad. He's a commie.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.797
Guess what. He's right here.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.718
Hey, Nickolai...

05:52.920 --> 05:55.388
...Mark didn't mean
anything by that commie crack.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.672
Guys, I need help.
I have painful female problem.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.196
I hear cranberry juice
will clear that little puppy right up.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.590
No, I mean,
I have trouble with girl I date.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.432
She is so cute.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.995
Such good teeth.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.397
- You said "teeth," right?
- Yes.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.195
Breasts are a dime a dozen.
Good teeth are hard to find.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.674
But I find out my girl
go to spring formal with other guy.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.869
What I should do?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.559
You should forget about her.
I mean, look at you, man.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.392
You're the biggest hunk in Chicago.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.354
You should be bagging more panties
than a clerk at Victoria's Secret.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.148
Or if you don't wanna be
popping penicillin for life...

06:35.360 --> 06:39.114
...you ask your special girl if she'll
go steady and hope she says yes.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.349
Oh, she will.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.393
Next time you see Nickolai,
he will be going steady with April.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.670
Later, radio dudes.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.997
Do they let everybody
into this country?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.593
Why, hello, Dean Rhoades.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.230
Hello, boys, I just heard your show.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.516
- You thought it was funny?
- Not remotely.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.555
Before I came here,
I looked up your grades.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.751
Now, that's entertainment.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.554
Look, this is gonna be my first
radio interview at this college...

07:20.760 --> 07:23.320
...and I don't want you future fry cooks
to screw it up.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.999
That's why I'm here.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.273
Well, that and the cheerleader tryouts
in the quad.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.428
So before they get
to the cartwheels...

07:34.640 --> 07:37.757
...I wanna give you the spontaneous
questions you'll be asking me.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.235
You want us to do a sham interview?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.874
We may only be students,
but we have principles.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.269
Me too. Never be late
for cheerleader tryouts.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.071
Oh, and it's windy too.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.394
All right.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.108
Say, "Toes."

08:06.320 --> 08:08.390
- Toes.
- Toes.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.234
Why toes?

08:11.480 --> 08:14.392
Well, in Wanker County,
that's where cheese comes from.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.428
That's our limo.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.792
April...

08:24.160 --> 08:26.196
...tonight you are my queen.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.358
And the man on the other side
of this door is our humble lackey.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.556
You're driving a limo?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.153
It was Marcie's idea.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.432
She promised I'd be rubbing
shoulders with major celebs.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.513
So far, it's just been a bunch
of horny college boys...

08:47.720 --> 08:50.075
...that think it'll help them get lucky.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.990
What a crock.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.516
- Does it work?
- Yep.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.312
Especially when they--
When they tip me to run out of gas...

09:00.520 --> 09:03.432
...just as a good Barry White song
comes on.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.153
Cool.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.997
April, tonight
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.113
Thank you, Mr. D'Arcy.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.873
Hey, remember our deal.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.594
You won't tell Mrs. D'Arcy
where I was tonight...

09:30.800 --> 09:34.793
...and I won't tell her you slow-danced
with the homecoming queen.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.992
Where am I?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.996
Is the dance over?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.716
It is for you.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.318
Did I have a good time?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.755
Sure, if you consider
having one beer...

09:55.960 --> 09:58.394
...and passing out in the refreshments
a good time.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.999
Bud...

10:02.200 --> 10:07.194
...while you were hurling picante sauce
into the ficus...

10:08.440 --> 10:11.273
...Nickolai asked me to go steady.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.117
Nickolai Pushkin?

10:14.360 --> 10:17.750
The basketball player
with the huge feet?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.790
I knew I'd never have a shot
at going steady with you.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.199
You wanna go steady?

10:26.880 --> 10:28.438
Yeah.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.358
Yeah, I do.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.032
So-- So, what do you say?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.598
I say...

10:35.800 --> 10:39.315
...before I commit to either of you
I need some time to think.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.918
Okay, I understand.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.680
We all have to be adults about this.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.077
By the way, Russians have tails,
you know.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.672
Look it up.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.555
Okay, boys, remember:

11:00.760 --> 11:03.513
Stick to my prepared questions
and you'll live to graduate...

11:03.720 --> 11:05.551
...and move back home
with your parents.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.039
Ready?

11:09.160 --> 11:12.357
This is Oliver and Mark,
live with Dean Rhoades.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.794
What up, collegians?

11:16.640 --> 11:18.790
So tell me, dean...

11:19.760 --> 11:24.550
..."how does it feel to be so powerful
and yet so damned good-looking?"

11:25.720 --> 11:28.393
Feels good. Feels damn good.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.389
April, before my post-game
radio program...

11:31.600 --> 11:34.433
...I must find a way to show you
how much you mean to Nickolai.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.396
Nickolai, you sent me flowers?

11:43.720 --> 11:47.554
Excuse me. Excuse me.
These flowers are from me, Bud.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.832
You see, the card reads,
"I love you truly."

11:51.080 --> 11:54.993
Not, "Nice kitty, rough tongue."

11:57.240 --> 11:58.832
Bud.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.435
April, I need to know.

12:02.640 --> 12:07.350
Do we go steady, or must I nail
many cheap sluts to forget you?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.713
April, I mean--

12:10.920 --> 12:12.433
April...

12:14.320 --> 12:15.469
...I need to know.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.999
Are we gonna go steady...

12:17.200 --> 12:20.909
<i>...or must I watch many cheap sluts
on Baywatch to forget you?</i>

12:22.120 --> 12:23.314
Well...

12:23.960 --> 12:26.349
There you are, young lady.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.548
You have been dodging my calls
since last night.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.228
Now, how do you explain
skipping the teller exam...

12:35.440 --> 12:37.271
...to go to a party with Bud?

12:37.520 --> 12:42.310
Well, I skipped the teller exam
to go to a party with Bud.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.152
Look, April, you cannot be
a successful banker...

12:46.360 --> 12:47.873
...if all you think about is men.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.915
You have to find yourself first...

13:00.120 --> 13:02.475
...and then you can look
for a boyfriend...

13:02.680 --> 13:04.159
...or Bud.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.591
Now, come with me,
I'll give you a makeup exam.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.030
Oh, my God, that's my ex-husband.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.478
That's Steve.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.473
For our next spontaneous question,
dean:

13:15.720 --> 13:18.393
"Was it your impressive résumé
that got you this job...

13:18.600 --> 13:20.272
...or your penetrating blue eyes?"

13:21.640 --> 13:25.872
It was a ragout of eyes and résumé,
with a dash of rapier wit.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.433
Please, I did some checking.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.672
Two months ago, you were
the chauffeur for the college president.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.916
How do you explain
your meteoric rise?

13:38.720 --> 13:41.518
That's not one
of the spontaneous questions.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.589
I don't suppose it had anything
to do with this picture you took...

13:45.800 --> 13:51.033
...of said president showing
his school spirit to the team mascot.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.158
This interview is over.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.157
Consider yourselves expelled.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.516
You will never
study in this town again.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.076
Steven Bartholomew Rhoades.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.756
Oh, no.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.357
I can't believe you are pushing
18-year-olds around.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.118
What will you do for an encore?

14:17.480 --> 14:21.359
I think I'll look at our wedding photos
and try to find your breasts.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.792
You're gonna have
to look pretty hard...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.390
...because they're hidden
under your gorgeous cousin's hands.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.710
You're not gonna let my ex
get away with this.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.071
Of course not. We're gonna go about
our lives as if none it happened.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.317
Hello, Starbucks?
You got any openings?

14:37.960 --> 14:41.430
Yeah, well, in the '60s, we would have
protested this kind of injustice.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.757
You know, bar the doors.
Seize the mikes.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.428
Tear the roof off this sucker.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.035
What do you say, Mark?

14:50.240 --> 14:53.198
I'm not sure. I might have to go
to coffee school in the morning.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.469
That's a yes.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.956
Well, what are we waiting for?
To the airwaves.

15:00.960 --> 15:06.478
Honest students
and scum-sucking administrators.

15:06.680 --> 15:11.196
Two righteous bros have been
expelled just for exposing the truth...

15:11.400 --> 15:12.833
...which we have proof of.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.237
So we have liberated this station
and we will broadcast non-stop...

15:16.440 --> 15:17.998
...until they are back in school...

15:18.200 --> 15:22.716
...and ex-limo flunky Steve Rhoades
admits he's a weenie.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.279
Steve Rhoades,
give in to our demands now.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.598
The students have been mobilized.
You are surrounded.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.430
So these are your radicals?

15:41.640 --> 15:42.993
Odd.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.239
I don't hear anyone chanting,
"Attica, Attica."

15:47.560 --> 15:49.516
Attica! Attica!

15:56.120 --> 15:57.678
One guy.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.631
Don't worry. They will come.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.358
One guy.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.113
Shall we discuss the terms
of our surrender?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.908
No, Mrs. D'Arcy, this is my fight.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.550
Well, actually it's your fight,
I just stupidly got caught up in it.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.877
But I'm ready to take it.
I'm gonna light up these phone lines.

16:23.080 --> 16:27.358
That's great. That gives me time
to get a gas mask and a mocha latte.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.678
Students, faculty,
people whose radio dials are stuck.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.277
Let me quote for you the bylaws
of our besieged radio station.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.109
In article B, section two:
"Procedures for Binding Arbitration."

16:43.360 --> 16:44.554
He's killing us.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.830
Yeah, well, you should
see him on a date.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.634
Why don't you stay here while I think
of a way to get our audience excited.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.398
Solid.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.992
I just don't know who to choose.
I mean--

17:03.400 --> 17:06.994
Nickolai, you're so strong...

17:07.240 --> 17:10.232
...and, Bud, you're so cute.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.511
Is Nickolai not cute?

17:14.520 --> 17:16.032
Oh, yes.

17:16.240 --> 17:20.028
And my body melts
from your searing kisses.

17:21.319 --> 17:25.790
--pursuant to FCC code 117-V,
paragraph six.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.031
<i>But I don't have to tell you that.</i>

17:28.280 --> 17:30.077
What about my kisses?

17:30.280 --> 17:31.508
They sear.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.597
You can ask anybody I've kissed.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.279
Ask--

17:35.520 --> 17:38.273
- Ask--
- Your mother?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.956
Let's do it, punk.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.518
I accept your apology.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.550
They have come.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.077
Get out of here.
What's the matter with you people?

17:52.600 --> 17:53.828
April.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.308
Before I met you...

17:55.520 --> 17:59.433
...a hot date was when my rubber woman
got her thigh stuck on the radiator.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.396
In Chechnya, we can't afford
rubber woman.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.478
We have to draw happy face
on inner tube.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.677
I don't blame you.
I've seen Russian women.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.029
As long as you say you're sorry.

18:19.720 --> 18:24.748
<i>April, I'm 21 years old
and I've only had sex four times.</i>

18:25.960 --> 18:28.599
You told me you've been involved
with hundreds of women.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.597
But they weren't real--

18:32.080 --> 18:35.868
--ly important to me. Like you are.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.075
Mr. Bud?

18:37.280 --> 18:40.078
Hey, you'll get your shot,
Hoop Dreams.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.712
April, please choose me.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.876
I'm tired of sitting home
Saturday nights...

18:45.080 --> 18:48.436
...moaning in two different voices
so my sister won't tease me.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.640
- Bud.
- What is it?

18:52.880 --> 18:54.518
We are on the air.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.470
Yes, you are.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.592
Of course.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.074
<i>You've been listening
to Hot Talk With...</i>

19:04.280 --> 19:05.952
<i>- April.
- ....April.</i>

19:06.160 --> 19:09.152
If you'd like to keep this program
on the air, call the station...

19:09.360 --> 19:12.511
...or better yet, come down here
and get in Dean Rhoades' face.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.439
April, will you take some calls
for us here?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.993
You're on the air with April.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.876
<i>Hi, my name is Sandy and I really
think you should choose Nickolai.</i>

19:25.120 --> 19:27.588
Thank you. Next.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.315
<i>Yeah, my name's Jill
and I think you should choose Bud.</i>

19:36.080 --> 19:37.832
Thank you.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.674
<i>You're on Hot Talk.</i>

19:39.880 --> 19:43.873
<i>Yeah, hi. My name is Kelly Bundy
and I think you should choose Nickolai.</i>

19:48.760 --> 19:51.672
Look, Nick, Bud,
I know you want my answer...

19:51.880 --> 19:53.871
...but it's such a hard choice.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.477
I mean, if I choose Nick, I would be
the envy of every girl in Chicago.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.438
If I choose Bud...

20:00.640 --> 20:03.632
...Nick would beat you
to a bloody stump.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.508
I wouldn't care.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.830
Oh, you would care.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.678
The people are with us.
We've raised their consciousness.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.553
Power to the people!
Power to the people!

20:14.800 --> 20:16.995
Take off your shirt!

20:20.800 --> 20:24.315
Well, guys, I think Mrs. D'Arcy
may just be right.

20:24.560 --> 20:28.838
I mean, maybe I need to find myself
before I find a boyfriend.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.196
- Do you understand?
- Perfectly.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.311
What did she say?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.075
She's dumping us both, man.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.794
- Let's go have a beer.
- Okay.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.629
But an O'Doul's for you, little friend.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.989
<i>Hot Talk! Hot Talk! Hot Talk!
Hot Talk! Hot Talk!</i>

20:47.840 --> 20:50.718
Well, it's working.
They're hanging the dean in effigy.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.515
That's not effigy.
They're really stringing him up.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.719
I've decided, out of my own sense
of decency, to give into your demands.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.593
Mark and Oliver are back at school
and on the radio station.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.156
But you have not heard
the last of me.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.953
April, I heard what you said
about me being right.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.799
So I guess this means
you want to be a banker?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.035
Not exactly.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.550
I wanna go to Trumaine
and work at this radio station.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.751
But you've only done that
for five minutes.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.468
And look, I'm really good at it.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.356
Fine. Then I'll just find someone else
to work under me.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.716
Oh, Nickolai!

21:34.120 --> 21:38.238
And the fact that Trumaine
is a land-grant college...

21:38.480 --> 21:40.516
...protects the station's
freedom of speech...

21:40.720 --> 21:43.314
- ...along with assembly...
- Oliver. Oliver.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.715
- ...religion--
- Oliver, you can stop now.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.797
Dean Rhoades has given in.

21:48.240 --> 21:53.075
You mean, I did it. I won. I moved
them with my compelling oratory?

21:53.320 --> 21:55.356
Yeah, you're the man.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.239
Guess what else?

21:57.440 --> 22:00.034
Our little radio station has found
an audience, my friend.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.549
You know what that means?
We are a hit.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.758
Well, this is great news.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.111
But now that we have power,
we must be careful not to abuse it.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.550
Oh, we won't.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.949
<i>- This is Mark Campbell.
- This is Oliver Cole.</i>

22:14.160 --> 22:15.718
<i>And this is April Adams.</i>

22:15.960 --> 22:18.952
Tune in tomorrow, when we'll make
surprise phone calls...

22:19.160 --> 22:22.072
...to wives of professors
who sleep with students.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.355
We have names.
We have numbers. We have...

22:27.960 --> 22:29.712
...arrived.
