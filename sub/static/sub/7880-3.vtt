Hey, Stan.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.538
You want to check out
this new jazz club tonight?

00:36.539 --> 00:38.466
The Jazzberry Beret?

00:38.467 --> 00:40.504
Wait, did Hot Jazz In Your Face close?

00:40.505 --> 00:42.545
Hot Jazz In Your Face closed
a while ago.

00:42.546 --> 00:45.500
People just stopped coming.

00:45.501 --> 00:47.500
(ding)

00:47.501 --> 00:49.538
Well, I can't go out
with you tonight, I'm booked.

00:49.539 --> 00:52.550
On Sunday and Tuesday nights, I
hang out at the CIA Chill Zone.

00:52.551 --> 00:54.488
- What's that?
- Oh, dude,

00:54.489 --> 00:56.555
it's this killer house that used
to be owned by a terrorist cell,

00:56.556 --> 00:59.487
but the CIA took it over,
Febreze-ed the hell out of it,

00:59.488 --> 01:01.508
and then turned it
into a kick-ass social club.

01:01.509 --> 01:02.542
It's wicked awesome.

01:02.543 --> 01:04.512
Come on, can't you blow it off?

01:04.513 --> 01:06.554
Sorry, babe, my Chill Zone
nights are sacred.

01:06.555 --> 01:08.494
Why don't you sign us up
for another night?

01:08.495 --> 01:09.546
I have drinks with Klaus tomorrow,

01:09.547 --> 01:11.474
but I can totally blow that off.

01:11.475 --> 01:12.463
(groans)

01:17.509 --> 01:19.500
Hey...

01:19.501 --> 01:20.551
what's going on in there?

01:20.552 --> 01:23.491
Oh, Stan and I used
to be best friends,

01:23.492 --> 01:26.554
but lately all he wants to do
is hang out with his buddies.

01:26.555 --> 01:28.542
Listen, Frannie, at a certain point

01:28.543 --> 01:30.550
a man needs to hang
out with other people

01:30.551 --> 01:33.466
and get away from his
wife because it's boring.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.479
I'm tired of talking to you,
and it's only been 20 seconds.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.525
I feel like talking to Klaus,
that's how bored I am.

01:38.526 --> 01:39.558
(groans)

01:39.559 --> 01:42.462
I know there are boring wives
out there,

01:42.463 --> 01:44.516
but I'm the fun wife.

01:44.517 --> 01:45.554
You know what?

01:45.555 --> 01:49.524
I'm gonna pick up some brewskies
and swing by Stan's Chill Zone

01:49.525 --> 01:52.538
to show him that I can be
just as much fun as his friends.

01:53.555 --> 01:55.516
Well, she's gone.

01:55.517 --> 01:58.483
Probably for at least half an hour.

01:58.484 --> 02:01.545
Should we fool around again?

02:01.546 --> 02:03.466
God, Klaus, no.

02:03.467 --> 02:05.538
I told you that was just
a 10-time thing.

ALL:
Boy Bomb!

03:01.496 --> 03:03.487
(explosion sounds)

03:03.488 --> 03:05.550
(giggles)

03:05.551 --> 03:08.466
(clapping) You kids did it.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.499
You blew me away.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.553
Lew Schneider, Snot's uncle.

03:10.554 --> 03:12.501
I've been in the
recording arts industry

03:12.502 --> 03:15.559
for 13 non-consecutive years.

03:18.463 --> 03:19.496
And we got everything we need

03:19.497 --> 03:21.520
to turn you guys
into a successful boy band.

03:21.521 --> 03:22.553
White kid who can sing.

03:22.554 --> 03:23.546
Relatable fat kid.

03:23.547 --> 03:25.466
Asian.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.551
And the pretty boy
with the gorgeous <i>punim.</i>

03:27.552 --> 03:31.550
I think you boys are ready to
make your first music video.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.551
- Yay!
- (giggles)

03:33.554 --> 03:35.524
I can't remember the last time

03:35.525 --> 03:39.479
someone else's uncle took
a video of me.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.559
(men laughing)

03:43.521 --> 03:44.558
Hey, Francine.

03:44.559 --> 03:46.558
Hey, Dick,
I thought I'd bring some beers.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.516
Back up! Back up!

03:48.517 --> 03:49.559
No women! Men only!

03:49.560 --> 03:51.483
Calm down.

03:51.484 --> 03:52.555
I said back your ass up!

03:52.556 --> 03:54.555
Okay, okay.

03:58.467 --> 03:59.508
No light beer!

03:59.509 --> 04:00.559
That's girl stuff!

04:00.560 --> 04:02.545
Girls are gross! (screams)

04:02.546 --> 04:04.521
- (gun clicking)
- Dick, it's cool.

04:04.524 --> 04:05.558
She's gone.

04:05.559 --> 04:07.533
There's no more girls, man.

04:07.534 --> 04:09.559
There's no more girls.

04:12.467 --> 04:15.491
And now I need you
to turn over on your side.

04:15.492 --> 04:16.553
Oh, my God.

04:16.555 --> 04:17.551
Oh, my God, wait.

04:17.552 --> 04:19.483
Okay, it's in.

04:19.483 --> 04:21.464
And now I'm going
to turn on the water,

04:21.466 --> 04:23.461
and you're going to feel
a little pressure.

04:23.462 --> 04:24.467
(machine clicking, water running)

04:24.468 --> 04:25.487
Yeah...

04:25.488 --> 04:26.541
It's good.

04:26.542 --> 04:28.466
Real good.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.517
(groans) You can turn it up a bit.

04:29.518 --> 04:30.541
All the way.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.491
This ain't my first butt blast.

04:33.492 --> 04:36.474
Ooh, you know what, Liddane,
turn it down just a little.

04:36.475 --> 04:38.495
What's the matter, Frannie,
you look troubled.

04:38.496 --> 04:40.512
Oh, they wouldn't let
me in the Chill Zone

04:40.513 --> 04:42.483
because it's men only.

04:42.484 --> 04:44.524
What on Earth is Stan doing in there

04:44.525 --> 04:47.479
that's so much more fun
than hanging out with me?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.479
Well, you could ask him,
but he'd have to lie.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.500
Men's clubs are shrouded in secrecy.

04:51.501 --> 04:53.470
(grunts, meowing)

04:53.471 --> 04:55.551
Aw, Puddin, you know you're
not allowed outdoors.

04:55.552 --> 04:57.551
Put her back in there;
she's an inside cat.

04:57.552 --> 04:59.466
What was I saying?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.558
Oh yes, men's clubs
are shrouded in secrecy.

05:01.559 --> 05:05.534
But luckily, I know a way around that.

05:08.463 --> 05:09.521
What do you want?

05:09.522 --> 05:10.550
I'm Frank.

05:10.551 --> 05:12.541
From the Chicago office.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.524
Hey, Frank, I'm Dick.

05:14.525 --> 05:16.551
Welcome to the Chill Zone;
let me get you a beer.

05:16.552 --> 05:18.551
- (men laughing and yelling)
- I told him.

05:18.554 --> 05:21.467
- (zippering)
- That is what I told him

05:21.470 --> 05:22.516
(beeps)

05:22.517 --> 05:25.558
Roger, you forgot to button
the top of my man costume.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.537
But it worked, I'm in.

05:27.538 --> 05:28.555
Sorry dude, wrong number.

05:28.556 --> 05:30.504
You sound hot.

05:30.505 --> 05:31.546
How old are you?

05:31.547 --> 05:34.512
No, Roger, it's me, Francine.

05:34.513 --> 05:37.479
You can't pretend to be a
runaway teen for one minute?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.534
After all I've done for you?

05:38.535 --> 05:40.558
I-I don't know what to say.

05:40.559 --> 05:43.550
It's easy, just say,
"Hi, my name's Tyler.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.516
"I'm 17, I'm lost and cold,

05:46.517 --> 05:48.490
"and my parents don't understand me.

05:48.491 --> 05:49.555
"Can you help me?

05:49.556 --> 05:52.462
"I just need a warm
bed for a few nights

05:52.463 --> 05:55.495
before I head to California
to become a surf model."

05:55.496 --> 05:56.558
Hello?

05:56.559 --> 05:59.474
It's still me, Francine.

05:59.475 --> 06:00.555
Oh, so you got into the Chill Zone.

06:00.556 --> 06:02.495
That's great.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.558
Hey, can you put Tyler back on?

06:04.559 --> 06:06.516
(sighs)

06:06.517 --> 06:08.479
Um, hello?

06:08.480 --> 06:09.559
Is this someone who can help me?

06:09.560 --> 06:10.559
(gasps)

06:17.513 --> 06:19.516
This is some place you got.

06:19.517 --> 06:22.508
As a man and not a woman,

06:22.509 --> 06:24.529
I feel really comfortable here.

06:24.530 --> 06:27.524
I have equipped you
with a mechanical voice box

06:27.525 --> 06:30.550
that will disguise your voice
and make you sound like a man.

06:30.551 --> 06:34.545
I've also given you a micropenis
like most Chicago men.

06:34.546 --> 06:38.550
I got to say, I'm having trouble
believing you're from Chicago.

06:38.551 --> 06:41.545
(giggles)
Yeah? Why?

06:41.546 --> 06:43.491
Because it's so exciting.

06:43.492 --> 06:46.516
Imagine that!
Chicago, Chicago!

06:46.517 --> 06:48.529
Cha-cha cha,
cha-cha cha cha.

06:48.530 --> 06:49.781
Chicago.

06:49.901 --> 06:51.339
Illinois.

06:58.219 --> 07:00.189
Hey, Stan.

07:00.190 --> 07:02.197
I'm Frank from Chicago.

07:02.198 --> 07:03.269
What's your name?

07:03.270 --> 07:05.285
Uh, you just said it.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.277
(laughs)

07:07.278 --> 07:11.235
Sounds like you know what
you're talking about, brother.

07:11.236 --> 07:13.236
I want to party with this guy.

07:14.190 --> 07:15.221
Welcome aboard, new guy.

07:15.222 --> 07:16.250
I'd shake your hand,

07:16.251 --> 07:18.248
but these wise guys
handcuffed me for a goof.

07:18.249 --> 07:20.231
They're goofing me good.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.282
Hey, what part of Chicago
are you from?

07:21.283 --> 07:24.227
Wh-What's with the third degree?

07:24.228 --> 07:26.247
You think I'm a woman in a costume?

07:26.248 --> 07:27.269
Is that what you think?

07:27.270 --> 07:30.235
Do I got to pull sausage on you?

07:30.236 --> 07:32.251
(zippering, thud)

07:32.252 --> 07:35.227
Whoa, I want some of that.

07:35.228 --> 07:37.239
(men cheering)

07:37.240 --> 07:38.265
DICK:
Attaboy, Sanders.

07:38.266 --> 07:40.235
Open wide.

07:40.236 --> 07:43.247
Oh, I see you've started
your fun without me.

07:43.248 --> 07:46.219
Thanks for waiting.

07:53.228 --> 07:55.243
Who-who are all these guys?

07:55.244 --> 07:57.235
I was up all night

07:57.236 --> 07:59.247
thinking about boys,

07:59.248 --> 08:01.281
and I realized something.

08:01.282 --> 08:03.251
12 boys, one stage.

08:03.252 --> 08:06.251
12 outfits,
each one bursting with boy.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.193
This is Boy Jam,

08:09.194 --> 08:11.239
and this is Boyz with Mouthz.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.260
But today I am combining
all three bands

08:14.261 --> 08:16.277
to form one super band called

08:16.278 --> 08:19.228
Boyz 12.

08:20.248 --> 08:22.244
Now, I've written one hell of a song.

08:22.245 --> 08:26.243
And I went to Express Men and
bought a ton of hot boy clothes.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.238
I'm willing to put
my reputation, time,

08:28.239 --> 08:29.269
and money on the line,

08:29.270 --> 08:32.231
but I need to know from all of you

08:32.232 --> 08:34.190
that you will bring it.

08:35.251 --> 08:38.206
Okay, loosen up those throats, boys.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.248
Let's warm up.

08:40.256 --> 08:43.280
(harmonizing)
♪ Boyz 12, Boyz 12... ♪

08:43.282 --> 08:45.251
I can do anything!

08:45.252 --> 08:48.214
I'm a million miles tall!

08:48.215 --> 08:50.239
Is your uncle on drugs?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.211
Probably.

08:54.215 --> 08:56.243
So...

08:56.244 --> 08:58.231
remind me again,

08:58.232 --> 09:02.218
why would we rather be here
than at home with our wives?

09:02.219 --> 09:04.211
'Cause here we can do
whatever we want.

09:04.212 --> 09:06.231
Wives don't let you drink
and play ping pong

09:06.232 --> 09:07.265
in the middle of the damn day.

09:07.266 --> 09:09.214
But dudes,

09:09.215 --> 09:11.286
maybe we should give our wives
the benefit of the doubt.

09:11.287 --> 09:14.239
Maybe they'd not only support our fun,

09:14.240 --> 09:16.272
but want to join in as well.

09:16.273 --> 09:19.189
You know,

09:19.190 --> 09:21.252
that sounds like something
a woman would say.

09:22.282 --> 09:24.281
I've also equipped your man suit

09:24.282 --> 09:26.214
with a fart machine.

09:26.215 --> 09:28.222
If you ever arouse suspicion, use it.

09:28.223 --> 09:31.282
Farts immediately calm men down
and reestablish their trust.

09:33.252 --> 09:35.252
(farts loudly)

09:38.236 --> 09:39.260
Hilarious!

09:39.261 --> 09:40.286
This guy gets it!

09:40.287 --> 09:43.269
Ah, that fart really calmed me down.

'Sup, mountain douche?

09:53.258 --> 09:55.251
Want to pound a cold one?

09:55.252 --> 09:56.285
Um, what?

09:56.286 --> 09:58.263
I was thinking
we were gonna have dinner.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.240
Why is there a ping-pong table
in here?

10:00.241 --> 10:03.218
Uh, so we can play beer pong.

10:03.219 --> 10:05.209
I don't understand
what's going on here.

10:05.210 --> 10:06.252
What's going on here is...

10:06.253 --> 10:07.281
Shots!

10:07.282 --> 10:08.261
Shots, shots!

10:08.262 --> 10:10.218
Shot-shot, shot-shot!

10:10.219 --> 10:12.201
Shots, shots,
shot-shot-shot!

10:12.202 --> 10:14.193
Shot, shot, shot-shot-shot!

10:14.194 --> 10:15.235
Everybody!

10:15.236 --> 10:18.247
Shot, shot, shot,
shot-shot-shot!

10:18.248 --> 10:19.264
So...

10:19.265 --> 10:22.239
wh-what time
is dinner gonna be?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
6:00.

10:25.286 --> 10:28.189
Why doesn't Stan want
to have fun with me?

10:28.190 --> 10:30.269
He wanted to do all this stuff
at the Chill Zone.

10:30.270 --> 10:32.277
Maybe he just doesn't
see you as a friend.

10:32.278 --> 10:35.243
But husbands and wives
are best friends.

10:35.244 --> 10:37.247
Ugh, that's just what stupid people

10:37.248 --> 10:39.281
say to each other in their
stupid wedding vows.

10:39.282 --> 10:41.231
Please, say that at your wedding,

10:41.232 --> 10:44.260
then play that ukulele version
of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

10:44.261 --> 10:46.277
Real original, Dave.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.277
Ooh, maybe you should get a dog

10:48.278 --> 10:50.244
the year before you have children,

10:50.245 --> 10:53.222
you know, for practice.

10:53.223 --> 10:57.264
Kill yourself Dave, your life's
been lived like a billion times.

10:57.265 --> 11:00.210
Francine, as a married woman,

11:00.211 --> 11:02.190
here are your choices for best friend:

11:02.191 --> 11:04.918
Fat woman, cat, gay guy, food.

11:05.008 --> 11:06.896
Wait a minute, I'm Frank.

11:06.897 --> 11:09.838
So when Stan's having fun with Frank,

11:09.839 --> 11:11.871
he's actually having fun with me.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.867
(gasps) That's it!

11:13.868 --> 11:16.900
I'll hang out with Stan as
Frank until we're best friends,

11:16.901 --> 11:19.855
and then I'll reveal myself to him,

11:19.856 --> 11:21.833
and he'll realize he's been married

11:21.834 --> 11:22.889
to his best friend all along.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.842
(gasps)

11:24.843 --> 11:27.821
Francine, you are the smartest,
most rational person I know.

11:27.822 --> 11:30.872
I don't see any way this plan
isn't going to end perfectly.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.821
Ah, this is great.

11:34.822 --> 11:37.884
Yep-yep-yep, just a
couple of guys in the tub,

11:37.885 --> 11:40.879
soft boilin' they eggs.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.913
Soft boilin' they eggs.

11:42.914 --> 11:44.896
Hey, check this out.

11:44.897 --> 11:46.839
Yo, Dick!

11:56.860 --> 11:58.888
(laughing)

11:58.889 --> 12:00.867
We sure have fun, huh?

12:00.868 --> 12:01.884
We sure do.

12:01.885 --> 12:03.896
Hey, I just heard the new joke!

12:03.897 --> 12:06.875
What's black and white
and red all over?

12:06.876 --> 12:08.892
Two nuns in a chainsaw fight?

12:08.893 --> 12:11.855
(laughter)

12:11.856 --> 12:12.855
Nuns!

12:12.856 --> 12:13.863
No.

12:13.864 --> 12:16.821
I wanted to do the joke.

12:16.822 --> 12:17.830
Well, we're laughing at ya.

12:17.831 --> 12:19.879
(laughter)

12:19.880 --> 12:21.871
Oh, God, shot at the boss!

12:21.872 --> 12:22.910
Frank, you're the best!

12:22.911 --> 12:25.821
(laughing)

12:25.822 --> 12:27.875
Uh, Frank, you're leaking.

12:27.876 --> 12:29.910
Your belly button is leaking...

12:34.856 --> 12:36.856
(extended farting)

12:42.893 --> 12:44.893
(farting fades into distance,
then returns)

12:47.822 --> 12:49.822
(fart continuing)

12:53.910 --> 12:56.826
(fart stops)

12:57.826 --> 12:59.835
(laughter, cheering)

13:00.860 --> 13:05.821
No one's that perfect
and farts that deep.

13:05.822 --> 13:09.842
Time to find out
who this Frank really is.

13:09.843 --> 13:10.839
(line ringing)

13:10.840 --> 13:13.892
MAN: Da CIA, Chicago,
how can I help you?

13:13.893 --> 13:16.829
This is Deputy Director Bullock
from Langley.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.834
I'm calling about Frank.

13:19.835 --> 13:20.897
MAN:
Yeah, just a sec.

13:20.898 --> 13:22.842
FRANK:
Dis is Frank.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.829
How are you there?

13:24.830 --> 13:25.883
You're in Virginia.

13:25.884 --> 13:27.856
FRANK: That's not true
because I'm in Chicago.

13:27.857 --> 13:30.884
I'm looking at you right now.

13:30.885 --> 13:32.864
FRANK: Well, then,
you must be in Chicago.

13:32.865 --> 13:36.829
No, you transferred to Virginia
and you're here now.

13:36.830 --> 13:37.841
FRANK (screaming):
I have heard enough!

13:37.842 --> 13:38.901
I am not going to stand here

13:38.902 --> 13:43.825
and let you tell me where I am
when I know exactly where I am!

13:43.826 --> 13:45.825
Chi... ca... go!

13:45.826 --> 13:46.839
WOMAN:
Frank, calm down.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.839
Ya heart!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.829
FRANK:
No! I will not calm down!

13:49.830 --> 13:50.833
MAN:
You tell him, Frank!

13:50.834 --> 13:51.914
FRANK:
Let me handle this, Gary!

13:53.872 --> 13:54.875
Smith!

13:54.876 --> 13:57.825
Would you join me inside for a moment?

13:57.826 --> 13:58.825
Whoa!

13:58.826 --> 13:59.824
I almost slipped.

13:59.825 --> 14:00.847
We gotta put some towels down.

14:00.848 --> 14:02.879
After doing some research on Frank,

14:02.880 --> 14:07.817
I've discovered that he is
not who he claims to be.

14:07.818 --> 14:08.868
What? Who is he?

14:08.869 --> 14:10.842
I don't know yet.

14:10.843 --> 14:13.846
I feel like his name might be Ricky.

14:13.847 --> 14:15.838
But what I do know for sure

14:15.839 --> 14:19.846
is that he has infiltrated a
CIA facility and must die.

14:19.847 --> 14:21.913
I can't believe Frank would do this.

14:21.914 --> 14:25.850
Yes, well, since you and
Frank are such besties,

14:25.851 --> 14:27.875
I thought you should kill him.

14:27.876 --> 14:30.850
Frank, can you come here?

14:30.851 --> 14:33.846
Frank, I want you and Smith
to go on a beer run.

14:33.847 --> 14:35.842
Alone.

14:35.843 --> 14:36.905
Awesome!

14:36.906 --> 14:38.914
I've been hoping to spend
some alone time with Stan!

14:41.826 --> 14:42.863
(phone rings)

14:42.864 --> 14:44.834
Go for Bullock.

14:44.835 --> 14:45.834
Oh!

14:45.835 --> 14:46.850
(groans)

14:46.851 --> 14:49.826
Why didn't I lay down some towels?

14:55.826 --> 14:57.031
This is fun, right?

14:57.151 --> 14:59.872
Just a couple buddies,
out on a beer run.

15:00.872 --> 15:01.897
(phone chimes)

15:03.872 --> 15:05.552
Hmm... what?

15:05.672 --> 15:09.247
I'm just saying, Bullock chose
us to go on the beer run.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.868
He must think we're best friends
or something.

15:17.578 --> 15:19.188
Hey, where are we going?

15:19.189 --> 15:20.516
I know the truth about you.

15:20.636 --> 15:22.168
You do?!

15:22.169 --> 15:23.168
So...

15:23.169 --> 15:24.198
what do you think?

15:24.199 --> 15:25.335
I'm shocked.

15:25.455 --> 15:26.510
I thought I knew you.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.155
Baby, it's still me.

15:29.156 --> 15:31.214
Don't you see how great
this is for us?

15:31.215 --> 15:32.218
Us?

15:32.219 --> 15:34.189
There is no us.
Not anymore.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.148
- But Stan...!
- The only "but" is the butt of my gun.

15:39.151 --> 15:39.852
What?

15:39.972 --> 15:42.131

19:46.718 --> 19:47.843
You sicko!

19:47.963 --> 19:49.592
Francine, you're alive!

19:49.712 --> 19:51.318
And you're inside Frank!

19:51.319 --> 19:53.322
Frank ate you?!

19:53.323 --> 19:55.339
Wait, no, no, what's going on...

19:55.340 --> 19:56.351
Why?

19:56.352 --> 19:58.339
Why did you do this?

19:58.340 --> 20:00.318
To spend time with you.

20:00.319 --> 20:03.843
I was worried you didn't
think I was fun.

20:03.963 --> 20:05.344
Baby, are you crazy?

20:05.757 --> 20:07.759
Just because I hang out
with other people

20:07.760 --> 20:09.777
doesn't mean I don't want
to spend time with you.

20:09.778 --> 20:12.319
Sometimes a man needs guy time.

20:12.439 --> 20:14.907
But all the time he needs his woman!

20:15.027 --> 20:16.777
Oh, Stan.

20:19.014 --> 20:21.688
Oh, my God!
What happened?

20:21.689 --> 20:22.746
D-D-Did he hurt you?

20:22.747 --> 20:23.769
Hey! She's fine.
We're fine.

20:23.770 --> 20:24.964
She doesn't look fine.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.735
Are you ready to die over this?

20:26.736 --> 20:27.738
Seriously?

20:27.739 --> 20:29.723
Is this how you want your hike to end?

20:29.724 --> 20:32.684
Hi, I'm Jon Hamm.

20:32.685 --> 20:35.688
Over a hundred percent
of all domestic disputes

20:35.689 --> 20:37.747
are just two people
trying to work stuff out.

20:37.748 --> 20:40.742
You getting involved isn't gonna help.

20:40.743 --> 20:42.254
You don't know what's going on.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.246
I don't care what you think you see,

20:44.366 --> 20:47.738
just keep your eyes down
and keep walking.

20:47.739 --> 20:50.705
