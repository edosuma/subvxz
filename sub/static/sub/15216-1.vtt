exterminating son

04:07.955 --> 04:12.584
strangling the breeze

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

04:19.507 --> 04:23.345
watching angels cry

04:23.429 --> 04:28.809
conquering the worm

04:52.124 --> 04:55.461
spreading from the fool

04:55.544 --> 05:00.007
Nowhere as you bleed

05:07.348 --> 05:10.976
Feast upon the cat

05:11.060 --> 05:15.272
Dying as you purr

05:32.873 --> 05:34.833
It's never quite that easy.

05:34.875 --> 05:38.420
You go through the door, and they're never 
just sitting there waiting for you...

05:38.504 --> 05:40.798
with a welcoming smile
on their face.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.925
Best you can do
is hope they fuck up...

05:43.008 --> 05:45.427
and do what you can
to be there when they do.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.138
And then blame yourself
for the killings ?

05:48.222 --> 05:51.225
Oh, no. I blame
the asshole who did them.

05:51.308 --> 05:54.103
This man's whole life
is about killing.

05:54.186 --> 05:56.855
He studies it.
He knows forensics.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.899
He understands
police procedure.

05:58.941 --> 06:02.778
He prepares methodically so as to not 
to leave any evidence at the scene.

06:05.739 --> 06:10.369
After he picks his target,
he'll watch her for weeks.

06:10.452 --> 06:13.122
He'll study every detail
of her routine--

06:13.205 --> 06:16.917
When she comes home.
When she goes to sleep.

06:20.170 --> 06:23.549
In the morning
before the sun comes up,

06:23.632 --> 06:26.844
he can walk
right up next to her.

06:26.927 --> 06:29.513
Even though the sun's still down,
no one perceives it as night.

06:29.596 --> 06:34.727
Women who are careful at midnight, 
walk around half-naked seven hours later.

06:34.810 --> 06:37.104
Finally,
he'll pick a day.

06:38.355 --> 06:40.858
Takes a kit of tools and props--

06:40.941 --> 06:45.112
duct tape, handcuffs, a weapon--
whatever he needs.

06:45.195 --> 06:47.114
He'll let himself in.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.201
That night,
she'll get home.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.246
Go about her business,
unaware that he's in the house.

07:46.590 --> 07:50.511
Oh... this is good.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.355
Shall we dance ? 

08:01.438 --> 08:05.150
No, don't play hard to get.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.152
This will be fun.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.248
Shh.

08:19.331 --> 08:24.003
Shh. It's over.
It's all right.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.213
Shh. 

08:26.296 --> 08:30.217
I said, "Shut... up."

08:38.726 --> 08:42.604
When she passes out...
from foreordain,

08:42.688 --> 08:47.192
he'll revive her
over and over again to--

08:48.569 --> 08:51.613
Um-- 

08:53.240 --> 08:55.159
What were you
going to say ?

08:59.913 --> 09:02.291
Time's up.

11:14.381 --> 11:16.300
Joel.

11:40.115 --> 11:42.785
Why did you turn
away from me ?

11:42.826 --> 11:46.121
Why was it so hard
for you to accept ?

11:46.163 --> 11:49.249
'Cause you know
I did it for you.

11:50.334 --> 11:53.545
You came so close to me
that night.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.757
I remember clearly what I felt
when I heard your footsteps following behind me.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.052
- Pride.

12:02.137 --> 12:04.515
I thought it would keep us
together forever.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.143
For me,

12:09.978 --> 12:12.147
it was our finest moment.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.484
I can still see the flames.

12:33.377 --> 12:37.047
Oh !

13:00.446 --> 13:02.948
Shit.
What the fuck ?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.013
Oh, fuck !

15:12.536 --> 15:14.455
I didn't see anything.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.175
Wanda, you wanna run that in to Sarge ?
Right on it.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.386
Hey, I'm Detective Mackie.
Welcome to my crime scene.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.971
Can I help you find anything ?

15:31.055 --> 15:34.641
I'm just going home.
I live upstairs.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.687
Did you not happen to notice that 
yellow police tape marked "Do Not Cross" ?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.191
If you're done with that, I'll just
take it and go home.- Do you know this woman ?

15:43.692 --> 15:45.361
I've never seen her.
What happened ? Is she dead ?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.988
Oh, I haven't made
any reference to homicide.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.990
Why would you hasten
to such a conclusion ?

15:50.074 --> 15:52.493
Well, you got half the block
taped off, and you got what,

15:52.576 --> 15:54.703
about a dozen cops in there,
fuckin' up your crime scene ?

15:54.745 --> 15:57.164
It just doesn't seem like
someone boosting stereos to me.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.626
Look here. Give me a call
if you think of anything.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.170
All right ?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.773
Hello. Yeah, this is Hollis.
Hello.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.069
This is Campbell.
I'm the guy-- We met last night.

17:14.241 --> 17:18.704
Yeah, Joel Campbell.
Our ex-F.B.I. friend from apartment 805.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.040
We did a little checking on you after you left.
What can I do for you ?

17:22.082 --> 17:25.919
I can hardly-- Are you busy ?
It sounds like you're in the middle of something.

17:25.961 --> 17:31.175
Yeah, some genius jacked a Honda a couple blocks ago.
That's an '86.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.178
- What, do you want me to call you back ?
- No.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.347
When did she die,
the girl ?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.766
Monday night.
Three days ago. Why ?

17:38.807 --> 17:41.769
'Cause I know who did it.
And how might you know that ?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.771
He mailed me a picture of her
still alive.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.564
I got it three days ago--
Monday morning.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.235
Hold on a minute, Campbell.
Teen hoodis on the run.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.798
Okay.
Sorry to keep you.

18:10.839 --> 18:15.094
Now... you wanna meet me
back at my office ? All right.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.100
Is it your custom to open your mail
four days after you get it ?

18:21.141 --> 18:24.770
Nope. Sometimes
it takes up to two weeks.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.315
Well,
this would appear...

18:28.399 --> 18:32.152
to answer any questions we had 
whether these two cases were related.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.989
Goodness gracious.

18:36.073 --> 18:40.285
Nothin' like a good serial killing
to kick off the holiday season.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.287
Right in here.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.498
Gimme a minute in that room.
Okay, Lieutenant.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.583
We got him sending
his pictures in the mail.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.752
Campbell, hell, we oughta get Bob Barker
in on this son of a bitch.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.171
It's a damn game show.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.134
His last alias was
David Allen Griffin.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.177
I worked the case for three and a half years
in Los Angeles.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.680
We attributed at least
11 homicides to him.

18:59.722 --> 19:05.561
- What's he doing in Chicago ?
- I assume he's still strangling young women with piano wire.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.565
All the victims were left partially unclothed,
 and all the swabs came back negative.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.234
Exactly.
No touchy, no feely.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.236
Have you ever seen
this guy ?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.238
No. No one's
ever seen him.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.824
Well, then we can't necessarily conclude
it's the same fella, can we ?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.826
Come on. He sent me
fuckin' pictures.

19:20.868 --> 19:24.747
Shoved the vic right up my ass
in my own fucking building.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.388
- Sorry.
- It's quite all right.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.390
You looked adorable.

19:45.392 --> 19:48.729
This film stock says
it's for exterior sunshine,

19:48.771 --> 19:50.939
but... how does it handle
in fluorescence ?

19:51.023 --> 19:54.026
Uh, I'm sorry.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.820
I just work here.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.993
- You do film processing here.
- Uh, yeah, one hour.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.038
- Do you mind ?
- Sure.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.795
- What are you doing ?
- I'm going to test it out.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.343
I'm gonna shoot some pictures,

20:19.426 --> 20:23.347
and you're going to
process them for me.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.738
Perfect.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.749
Yeah, chief of Chicago P.D.
already called.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.335
Not surprising,
I suppose, they're inviting us in on this.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.005
They're setting up a joint task force
as we speak.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.967
I'd like to know if you think
you can handle it on our end.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.885
I know that in L.A.--

21:01.969 --> 21:04.430
Oh, no, this isn't L.A.
It's not my job anymore.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.766
You know what ? The only reason 
that your burnt-out, messed-up ass...

21:07.808 --> 21:10.853
is standing in my office is because
you had a three-year head start on us.

21:10.936 --> 21:16.275
This perp is set on putting you
in the middle of this shit whether we like it or not.

21:16.316 --> 21:20.070
You're right.
The field office in L.A. has the relevant files.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.072
I can't tell you anything
that's not in them.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.660
I'm sorry.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.955
Mike. Excuse me.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.834
Mike, we got several sets of prints
off the FedEx envelope and the photo itself.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.170
I'm sorry. This is none of
my business, but, uh,

21:36.211 --> 21:38.172
you can run the prints.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.382
You're gonna get me,
the driver, three guys from the warehouse,

21:40.466 --> 21:44.636
Santa Claus...
a whole bunch of elves.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.805
Definitely not this guy.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.393
Who the hell is that ?

21:51.477 --> 21:56.065
Run it.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.068
Yes, sir.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.335
Ooh-ooh

22:58.419 --> 23:02.297
Can't anybody see

23:02.339 --> 23:04.925
Well, you're young.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.386
Do you plan to live on 
disability your whole life ?

23:09.471 --> 23:13.017
I take 200 milligrams of Seconal 
just so I can sleep two and a half hours a night.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.936
Twice a day, I take
400 milligrams of acebutolol...

23:15.978 --> 23:18.689
and 20 milligrams of lotensen
for high blood pressure.

23:18.772 --> 23:23.569
I self-inject migraine medicine
whenever the fuck I please.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.657
They don't...
mix well with work.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.784
Hmm.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.828
Maybe you're just afraid.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.830
Fuckin' right.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.708
I am afraid.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.170
Okay.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.298
Let's talk about that.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.803
I go places,
and I forget why I'm there.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.930
I miss exits on the freeway.

23:53.891 --> 23:57.227
I'm lucky to...
find my way home from the grocery store.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.564
And if I do, then...

24:00.647 --> 24:03.359
most of the time
I've forgotten my groceries.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.571
But yet, you make it
here every week.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.574
Twice a week.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.542
Yeah.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.420
You do.

24:26.006 --> 24:29.385
What if the next picture
that arrived was of your daughter ?

24:30.761 --> 24:33.931
Would you really want me
to be the one looking for her ?

24:37.643 --> 24:39.812
Yes.

24:42.356 --> 24:46.568
Yes... I would.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.780
From this moment

24:49.947 --> 24:52.574
How can it feel

24:52.658 --> 24:54.576
This wrong

25:46.378 --> 25:48.839
Hello.
Hi. It's me.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.841
Me ?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.057
Me who ?

25:58.140 --> 26:01.810
It's freaking cold here.
Why'd you move here ?

26:06.231 --> 26:08.150
What the fuck
do you want from me ?

26:08.233 --> 26:11.278
You hardly leave your apartment.
And when you do, it's to eat...

26:11.320 --> 26:14.490
at that same terrible Vietnamese restaurant
night after night.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.993
You seem so bored.
I was expecting a warmer welcome.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.580
I didn't fuckin'
ask you here, did I ?

26:21.663 --> 26:23.707
The guy they
replaced you with--

26:23.791 --> 26:27.670
I tried to make it work,
but we just didn't see eye to eye at all.

26:27.711 --> 26:31.799
I was going to quit the game entirely,
but then I thought, "Chicago's not so bad."

26:31.882 --> 26:34.593
At least you didn't move
to New Jersey, right ?

26:34.677 --> 26:36.595
Yeah.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.682
So, why don't you
grab a pen ?

26:39.765 --> 26:42.976
I'll give you the name and number of the...
agent that's on your case.

26:43.060 --> 26:47.815
You can... share your inner turmoil with him
'cause I don't give a shit.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.901
I know your job
is hard, Joel,

26:50.984 --> 26:54.947
so I'm willing to take steps
to try and make things work between us.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.951
- What are you talking about ?
- The photos, Joel.

26:59.034 --> 27:03.747
I'll send you a picture,
and you can have a day to try to find her.

27:03.831 --> 27:07.710
I'll give you till 9:00.
What do you say, Joel ?

27:07.793 --> 27:10.212
I say I should have moved
to New jersey, asshole.

27:10.254 --> 27:14.091
Good night, Joel.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.209
Are you all right ?
I think so.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.309
Shit !

28:18.864 --> 28:21.658
Who is it ?
 Flowers for Joel Campbell.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.953
You didn't answer the phone. The door downstairs was open,
so I thought I'd just bring--

28:27.998 --> 28:29.958
Put the flowers on the floor.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.213
Thank you.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.973
The photos, Joel.

28:45.057 --> 28:50.104
I'll send you a picture,
and you can have a day to try to find her.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.481
No, I've never seen her.
Is she dead?

28:52.564 --> 28:55.484
I haven't made any reference to homicide.
Why would you hasten to such a conclusion ?

28:55.526 --> 28:58.445
Are you just afraid ?
Fuckin 'right. I'm afraid.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.365
What if the next picture that arrived
was of your daughter?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.992
Really want me to be the one
looking for her?

29:04.076 --> 29:06.412
Yes.
I'll send you a picture.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.747
You can have a day
to try to find her.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.004
I got this a half hour ago.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.006
I want the case.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.550
Can you handle it ?

29:21.468 --> 29:23.554
I guess we'll find out.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.391
What else did this asshole say last night ?

29:27.474 --> 29:29.393
That's everything.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.146
We already have a trap and trace
on that line and on your cell phone.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.773
What is that ?
What is that, a bird ?

29:34.857 --> 29:38.485
This is a poster.
Looks like it was shot inside.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.529
Could be taken anywhere.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.824
It was processed commercially.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.909
See if these numbers are traceable.
If not, get me a list...

29:45.993 --> 29:48.370
of every place in the city that prints
on this Kodak paper. You got it.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.372
Is that mine ?
Thanks.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.500
I'm sorry. I can't remember your name.
Mitch Casper.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.711
Mitch, get this in the computer
and blow it up.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.505
Find out what's behind her on the wall.
That thing right there.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.342
Find out what kind of earrings she's wearing,
what kind of blouse that is.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.178
- What's that on her glasses ?
- Reflection, yeah.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.472
Find out something
about her. Anything.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.099
Both girls are basically loners,
very little social contact.

30:09.183 --> 30:11.518
The last girl's parents
were deceased.

30:11.602 --> 30:15.147
No close friends as far as we can tell.
Is that his victim profile ?

30:15.230 --> 30:18.484
No. I mean, the victims
were always young women,

30:18.567 --> 30:20.486
but he's sending
pictures now.

30:20.569 --> 30:23.113
He's only gonna target loners.
You know, women people don't notice.

30:23.197 --> 30:25.574
He's not gonna send me
a picture of the prom queen.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.077
Yeah. Well, listen.
Before we go any further,

30:28.160 --> 30:31.205
we're gonna have to make a decision
as to whether to go to the press with this.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.415
We gotta make it now.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.670
Look. There's no decision to make. 
There is shit else we can do for this woman.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.172
Let's get him
in front of the cameras.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.549
They're gonna like him.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.759
All I can tell you
at this time is that...

30:43.759 --> 30:44.927
All I can tell you
at this time is that...

30:44.968 --> 30:49.056
we have substantial reason to believe
this woman's life is in serious danger.

30:49.139 --> 30:53.477
The Chicago Police Department
and the F.B.I. are working in concert...

30:53.519 --> 30:56.605
to try and locate her,
and we're gonna be grateful for any help...

30:56.647 --> 30:58.691
you guys can give us
in this endeavor.

30:58.774 --> 31:02.569
Every hour is critical.
That's all.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.199
This young woman is missing.

31:07.282 --> 31:11.286
Authorities are frantically searching for her.
They fear for her safety.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.123
Any information on the whereabouts
or the identity of the woman...

31:14.206 --> 31:17.459
police are referring to as "Jane Doe,
"please call the number on your screen.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.753
This is the photograph
of an unknown young woman...

31:19.837 --> 31:23.549
who they say might fall victim to a murder
if she is not located by 9.:00.

31:23.632 --> 31:27.928
"What kind of earrings are those ?
What kind of blouse is that ?"

31:28.012 --> 31:30.889
What are you bitching about ?
Oh, come on, Diana.

31:30.973 --> 31:35.978
This was my case. Ibby opens the door
and in flies "Captain Barbiturate."

31:36.061 --> 31:38.105
You know, I don't care
how well he knows this creep.

31:38.188 --> 31:41.650
I say if his pupils don't dilate,
then we don't need him.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.321
Ma'am, there-- There hasn't
been a reward established,

31:46.405 --> 31:48.365
but I'm sure something can be done.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.412
Okay. Today ?
Was that today ?

31:53.495 --> 31:56.165
Okay, thank you.
We'll check it out.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.835
- Anything yet ? - Eighty-five, ninety calls
in the last fifteen minutes.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.754
I mean, lots of "maybes"
and "possibles."

32:01.837 --> 32:05.215
We're trying to sift through the shit,
but there's a lot of it.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.760
Despite a massive search
this afternoon,

32:07.843 --> 32:12.306
police still have not located the anonymous woman
whose photo was received this morning.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.976
They continue to rely on your help
in this frightening case.

33:13.117 --> 33:15.077
Mitch.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.999
What is that ? A sign ?
Uh-huh.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.461
- See ?
- Yeah, all right.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.215
I'll enhance the drum scan. We'll bring it
even closer, and we'll see what we got.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.217
All right ?
Fuck.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.219
Yeah.
The numbers are only relevant...

33:32.302 --> 33:34.555
if you find the location
where it was processed.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.182
- What about the paper ?
- The list is on its way.

33:37.266 --> 33:40.102
Eleven hundred locations.
Eleven hun-- What ?

33:40.144 --> 33:42.396
Do you know where there's
a Lou Mitchell's restaurant on Oak Street ?

33:42.479 --> 33:44.940
Yeah, it's in the Gold Coast area.
We'll take it. Let's run.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.535
Yep, I'm pretty sure
that washer.

33:56.618 --> 33:59.913
She was wearing a headband.
Was she alone or eating with someone ?

33:59.997 --> 34:03.083
Uh, she was alone.
When was the last time you saw her ?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.085
I don't know.
Sometime last week.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.296
Can you be more specific ?
What day ?

34:07.338 --> 34:10.841
No.
Not without making shit up.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.344
We don't want you to do that. I want every employee
that worked here in the last week...

34:14.386 --> 34:17.139
in the restaurant within the hour--
managers, cooks,

34:17.222 --> 34:19.058
dishwashers, cashiers.
That's gonna be hard.

34:19.141 --> 34:23.062
Life is hard. Pull every credit card
sale for the week.

34:23.145 --> 34:26.940
Eliminate men, married women, anyone over 40.
We need to call every one of them.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.109
Got it. I gotta be on the phone.
See if we can get some help.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.110
Okay.
Can you spare anyone ?

34:31.195 --> 34:33.112
I'll get you
all the help you want.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.991
Good. We'll fax them a list of names.
They need to start making calls.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.993
I'm on it.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.670
Okay. Thank you very much.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.380
Authorities are hoping
that as millions...

34:50.464 --> 34:54.677
return home from work and turn on the television,
that someone will recognize this young woman.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.638
They are taking this threat
on her life very seriously.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.935
What the fuck do you want me to say ?
It's five to 6:00, for Christ's sake.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.604
If they're not home,
call back in 45 minutes.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.606
They're getting home
from work.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.283
Excuse me.
Check this out.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.285
You were right.
It's definitely...

35:20.369 --> 35:23.664
"A-P" and the line
is an exclamation point.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.874
Does that mean
anything to you ?

35:27.418 --> 35:29.378
Add a "C-R" to it,
it spells "Crap."

35:29.420 --> 35:31.505
No. What do you
want me to say ?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.632
Yeah, that's true.
It spells "Crap."

35:33.716 --> 35:36.343
One of your waitresses
saw her here sometime last week.

35:36.427 --> 35:39.555
Look at the picture carefully
and tell me if you remember her.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.725
Sorry, man. I make it a point to pay
as little attention to the customers as possible.

35:42.808 --> 35:46.186
- Does it seem like
playtime to you ? - No.

35:46.270 --> 35:49.314
Take a look at the fucking picture
and tell me if you saw her.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.027
- I never saw her.
- You sure ?

35:53.110 --> 35:56.864
Yeah.
That's too bad.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.491
Thank you for coming in.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.912
Come on, darling.
Click on your television set.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.206
It's Thursday night, goddamn it.
"Must-see TV."

36:06.290 --> 36:09.626
Earlier today, we told you investigators
were combing the streets of Chicago...

36:09.668 --> 36:11.920
searching for this woman--
a woman they are...

36:11.962 --> 36:14.590
referring to as "Jane Doe. "
Put up the fuckin' number. Let's go. Come on.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.717
They are still in need
of your help.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.012
- Come on ! Don't take--
- The city council approves a new budget.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.974
If that's all the help they're gonna give us--
What was the time of death on the other two ?

36:24.016 --> 36:26.769
- What ?
- 9:00.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.898
It's done.
We're notgonna make it.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.900
We're not gonna make it.

36:35.319 --> 36:37.654
Okay. Good night, Ellie.
See you tomorrow.

36:46.372 --> 36:49.833
That was it. Third possible
sighting in Fox Pavilion Mall.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.835
Grab some backup.
You wanna come with ?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.879
You know me,
your hat's on backwards.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.881
Talk to you later. Bye.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.400
Guys, look.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.860
She's been sighted here on
three separate occasions, okay ?

37:16.902 --> 37:19.238
Everybody we see walking around here
is a possible witness.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.491
So, I want you to find out. I don't know
if she works here, if she lives nearby.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.035
Take these fliers.
Get them to everybody in the place.

37:25.119 --> 37:27.621
I wanna show 'em, okay ?
You guys come with me.

37:27.705 --> 37:29.623
Who spoke to
the most recent caller ? I did.

37:29.707 --> 37:31.792
You ? Let's go.
Take level three.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.465
Can you take a look
at these pictures, please ?

37:38.549 --> 37:41.593
Speak to the gentleman back here.
Take a look at that, please. Thank you.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.971
Take a look at that ?
Thank you.

38:12.541 --> 38:16.253
If you see her, please give us a call.
No, I've never seen her.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.864
Frank ?
Hey, Frankie !

38:43.947 --> 38:47.159
How was your day, hmm ?

38:47.242 --> 38:50.829
Oh, yeah ? That's nice.

38:50.913 --> 38:53.832
Mine ? Not so good.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.783
Excuse me. Are you
the person who saw her ? -Yeah.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.827
Is this her ?
Where ? Yeah, that's her.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.204
I saw her down there
in the food court.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.747
There ? Right there ?
Yeah.

39:33.831 --> 39:36.750
When ?
At 2:30 this afternoon.

39:36.834 --> 39:39.086
Excuse me.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.550
Hollis. Hollis !

39:46.135 --> 39:48.053
What do you got ?

39:50.222 --> 39:52.558
The photo store.

39:52.599 --> 39:55.602
Where ? Where ?
The photo store.

40:00.274 --> 40:03.068
Here. Right here.
This is where he shot it.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.112
See ? There's our
little bird. Hello ?

40:05.195 --> 40:08.282
- Hey ! Hey !
- Sorry.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.743
Do you know this woman ?

40:10.826 --> 40:13.287
Uh, yeah. She just
started working here.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.956
It's Ellie. I'll need her phone number
and last name. Right now.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.751
Get her number now.
Okay. I have to call my boss.

40:18.792 --> 40:21.211
- Do it. Do it !
- Okay.

40:22.671 --> 40:26.884
- Goddamn cows.

40:36.310 --> 40:38.437
Hello.

40:38.479 --> 40:42.441
Mom ? Calm down.
What is it ?

40:44.818 --> 40:48.238
No, I'm sure that
you're overreacting.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.949
Gimme a break.
Why are you saying that ?

40:52.785 --> 40:57.247
Look, Mom. I very much doubt that your pharmacist
is just trying to poison you.

40:59.333 --> 41:02.127
Can we not do this right now, Mom ?
I'm in the middle of a movie.

41:02.211 --> 41:05.005
Yeah, Mom, with a man.

41:05.089 --> 41:07.007
Yeah, he's cute.

41:07.091 --> 41:11.470
I-I don't know
if it's serious or not.

41:11.512 --> 41:15.015
Look. If I tell you his name,
will you let me get off the phone ?

41:15.099 --> 41:17.101
His name is Frank.
Good-bye.

41:22.064 --> 41:26.318
- Come on. Come on.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.497
Yes ?

41:38.580 --> 41:41.750
Uh, I need to speak
to Ellie Buckner immediately.

41:41.834 --> 41:44.003
Oh, she can't come
to the phone right now.

41:44.086 --> 41:47.506
No, no, please, please. Put her on the line
immediately. It's a life-or-death emergency.

41:47.589 --> 41:50.509
Not anymore it's not.

41:50.551 --> 41:54.680
Wasn't that fun ?
It hasn't felt that good for years.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.682
Wasn't it suspenseful ?

41:56.724 --> 41:58.684
Oh, yeah,
that was a blast.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.563
This way is much more fun.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.565
It's amazing, isn't it ?

42:04.648 --> 42:07.443
We're all stacked
right on top of each other,

42:07.526 --> 42:10.612
but we don't really notice
each other anymore, do we ?

42:12.239 --> 42:16.035
You notice me though,
don't you, Joel ?

42:16.118 --> 42:18.037
Yeah, I notice you.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.363
Ellie Buckner.

42:54.073 --> 42:56.909
Single, 24,
parents live in Florida.

42:56.992 --> 42:59.912
So far, no known boyfriend.

42:59.953 --> 43:04.291
She has a cat named Frank.
Apparently, he doesn't watch the news.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.961
Wonder what happened
to that cat ?

43:08.045 --> 43:11.048
Pull the phone records,
okay ?

43:11.131 --> 43:14.093
Diaries, journals,
letters, address book.

43:14.176 --> 43:17.096
See if he's in contact
with these girls.

43:28.232 --> 43:30.234
Hey, ma'am.
Can you spare some change ?

43:30.275 --> 43:32.444
Hey, guys.
Hey, Dad !

43:32.528 --> 43:34.446
Dad, don't you
recognize me ?

43:34.530 --> 43:36.448
Hey, sir. Can you
spare some change ?

43:36.532 --> 43:38.450
What are you
doing out here ?

43:38.534 --> 43:41.286
Spare changing, man.
What's it look like ?

43:41.370 --> 43:44.248
- Don't you have a job or anything ?
- Yeah, whatever.

43:44.289 --> 43:47.001
Look. Are you gonna give me
some money, or what ?

43:47.084 --> 43:50.963
- Only if you dance with me.
- Shut the fuck up.

43:51.005 --> 43:54.967
- I'm serious.
- There's no music.

43:55.050 --> 43:59.138
- I'll lead, you follow.

44:03.058 --> 44:07.312
And one, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

44:14.194 --> 44:16.655
Damn it. Having a tough time there,
aren't you, with that ?

44:16.739 --> 44:19.491
I need a damn garden rake
to eat this.

44:19.575 --> 44:21.493
It's all in the tool.

44:21.577 --> 44:24.038
I'm done with that
for sure.

44:24.121 --> 44:26.832
So, listen here.

44:26.915 --> 44:31.462
What's the skinny on that radiant vision
of loveliness down at the feds ?

44:31.545 --> 44:33.714
What's her name ?
Diana ?

44:33.797 --> 44:37.760
What I wouldn't give for 20 minutes with her
at a drive-in and a decent bowl of chili.

44:37.801 --> 44:41.263
Damn if you haven't found the worst
restaurant in the whole city of Chicago.

44:41.305 --> 44:43.766
A really fine restaurant. The other night,
Griffin was giving me...

44:43.849 --> 44:46.268
a hard time about it
too on the telephone.

44:52.149 --> 44:54.109
What's up ?
What's up ?

44:58.322 --> 45:01.367
What do you think the chances are
he's watching us right now ?

46:00.759 --> 46:03.595
Hey. Hey !
Get outta here.

46:22.740 --> 46:27.077
Murder suspect heading west on Commerce,
near the intersection of Lincoln.

46:27.161 --> 46:29.705
Blue, two-door sedan,
mid- '80s, maybe a Ford.

46:54.188 --> 46:56.106
Fuck !
Goddamn it !

46:58.817 --> 47:01.278
I'm standing outside
the apartment of Ellie Buckner,

47:01.362 --> 47:04.114
the woman who Chicago
has come to know as "Jane Doe."

47:04.198 --> 47:08.077
The harrowing search came
to a tragic end about 9:20 P.M.,

47:08.160 --> 47:11.622
when police discovered Buckner's
body at her Wicker Park apartment.

47:11.705 --> 47:14.249
It is a murder that has shocked
this quiet neighborhood.

47:14.333 --> 47:16.251
Right--

48:01.630 --> 48:04.008
See you later. Bye.

48:41.170 --> 48:43.088
Excuse me.

49:07.446 --> 49:10.240
I can't stay long.
I just wanted to come by...

49:10.324 --> 49:12.242
and tell you how much
I appreciate...

49:14.328 --> 49:17.706
what you...
said the other day.

49:17.790 --> 49:20.084
How have
the headaches been ?

49:20.167 --> 49:22.086
About the same.

49:23.170 --> 49:25.047
Are you sleeping ?

49:25.130 --> 49:28.550
Some.

49:28.634 --> 49:31.470
How's work ?

49:31.553 --> 49:36.308
It's great. I'm building an excellent
fan base with the homicidal set.

49:37.393 --> 49:39.728
How do you feel
about that,

49:39.812 --> 49:41.980
about this man
following you to Chicago ?

49:42.064 --> 49:43.982
Is it a vendetta ?

49:46.026 --> 49:47.945
That's a strange question.

49:50.114 --> 49:53.200
No, I don't think vengeance
has anything to do with it.

49:53.283 --> 49:56.245
I think there's a story,
a ritual that he follows.

49:56.328 --> 49:58.789
Over the years, I became
part of the story.

50:00.582 --> 50:03.460
It probably didn't
make sense without me.

50:05.129 --> 50:07.214
In other words,
he missed you.

50:07.297 --> 50:09.258
Odd, isn't it ?

50:09.299 --> 50:11.510
Did you miss him ?

50:13.178 --> 50:15.097
What the hell
does that mean ?

50:16.390 --> 50:18.350
Excuse me.

50:18.434 --> 50:20.477
Sorry.

50:20.561 --> 50:23.230
Campbell.

50:23.272 --> 50:25.774
We received another photo.
I'll be right there.

50:44.918 --> 50:46.879
Where is she sitting ?

50:50.591 --> 50:53.427
Let's get somebody
from the city up here.

50:53.469 --> 50:56.055
See if they can tell us something
about this section of sidewalk.

50:56.138 --> 50:58.849
Is this the "El" here,
you know ? Parking meters.

50:58.932 --> 51:00.851
Yep, I'm on it.

51:02.978 --> 51:05.022
Mitch, let's get her picture
in tattoo parlors.

51:05.105 --> 51:07.399
Got it.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.621
What's your name ?

51:26.377 --> 51:29.713
Well, usually,
Mr. Abraham,

51:29.797 --> 51:32.257
I do an introductory session,

51:32.341 --> 51:35.469
where we both explore what you
hope to get out of therapy.

51:35.552 --> 51:38.681
If we both feel I'm the person
to provide that for you,

51:38.764 --> 51:41.350
then we can decide
on a schedule together.

51:41.433 --> 51:45.854
And-- And I like
to record my sessions.

51:45.938 --> 51:47.856
But if you prefer--

51:47.940 --> 51:50.025
Is that something that you do
with all of your patients ?

51:50.109 --> 51:52.986
Yeah, with most of them.

51:53.070 --> 51:57.741
- Would you prefer that I didn't ?
- Yes, I'd rather you not.

51:57.825 --> 52:01.704
Okay.
That's-- That's fine.

52:04.248 --> 52:07.710
So, you say that you might need help.
In-In what area ?

52:09.253 --> 52:11.672
I'm not sure.

52:11.714 --> 52:13.674
What kind of help
do you provide ?

52:13.716 --> 52:17.428
Well, I-I work with patients
on many different issues.

52:20.055 --> 52:23.559
Do you think...
some of your patients...

52:23.642 --> 52:28.397
might pay to come and see you
because... you're very pretty ?

52:30.566 --> 52:34.069
Let's keep this focused on you,
rather than on me, Mr. Abraham.

52:37.531 --> 52:39.450
Sure.

52:51.378 --> 52:55.132
Nice trick.

52:55.215 --> 52:59.303
I'm gonna try it again though, okay ?
Yeah, whatever.

53:02.097 --> 53:04.183
A couple of years ago, they did
a neighborhood renovation...

53:04.266 --> 53:07.519
where they put those benches
around some of the trees downtown.

53:07.603 --> 53:09.730
Where downtown ?
Bring up the city.

53:10.939 --> 53:13.067
Basically the Broadway
and Belmont area.

53:13.150 --> 53:15.736
That's 15 to 20 city blocks.
Yeah.

53:17.780 --> 53:20.449
There are five million
people in this city.

53:20.532 --> 53:23.035
How can no one have known this person ?
Can you spare some change ?

53:23.118 --> 53:25.871
How can this happen
in the communication age ?

53:25.954 --> 53:27.915
Authorities have focused
the search for "Jane Doe #2 "--

53:27.998 --> 53:31.710
Hey, Dad. Dad, it's me. Don't you
recognize me ? Leave me alone.

53:31.794 --> 53:33.754
Come on, Pop.
I need you, man.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.927
The city of Chicago is on alert.

53:40.010 --> 53:45.516
Police are searching for a woman connected
to the photograph they have received.

53:45.599 --> 53:49.895
It appears the murder may be linked
to a serial killer in the Los Angeles area.

53:49.978 --> 53:52.690
At this point, the woman
police are calling "Jane2"...

53:52.773 --> 53:55.109
has not yet been located...

53:55.192 --> 53:59.822
-and all those involved are very
concerned about her well-being.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.121
Yeah. We've got Jane Doe's
mother on the phone.

54:07.162 --> 54:09.123
I'll be right there.

54:42.406 --> 54:45.534
You know what ? Get a picture at every
skateboarding place and guitar shop...

54:45.617 --> 54:47.536
that's anywhere near that
Broadway and--

54:47.619 --> 54:49.663
Belmont.
Belmont. Exactly.

54:51.290 --> 54:53.292
Wish I could find some letters.
There aren't any.

54:53.375 --> 54:55.502
She never wrote anybody.

54:55.586 --> 54:59.340
She called three times.
Did she say where she was calling from ?

54:59.423 --> 55:03.177
She said all kinds of things. I never knew
what to believe. She has a new boyfriend.

55:03.218 --> 55:07.181
- So tell me about the boyfriend.
- He's a lawyer. Yeah, right.

55:07.264 --> 55:10.100
Can you remember anything else about the calls ?
Anything might help.

55:10.184 --> 55:14.229
A few months ago, she called to announce
she's got a job at Seattle's Best Coffee.

55:14.313 --> 55:15.647
Seattle's Best ?

55:15.647 --> 55:16.899
Seattle's Best ?

55:16.982 --> 55:21.236
Not good news. She does not work, nor has she
ever worked at Seattle's Best.

55:21.320 --> 55:25.199
I don't care whether she works there or not,
she is sitting in front of a coffee shop.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.326
I don't know.

55:27.409 --> 55:30.537
It looks like a bench to me.
It could be anywhere. I'll be honest with you.

55:30.579 --> 55:33.540
Look at the photo.
There are seven people in the picture.

55:33.582 --> 55:36.043
Three of them are holding
the same kind of coffee cup.

55:36.085 --> 55:38.504
She's sitting in front
of a fucking coffee shop.

55:38.587 --> 55:40.714
Get someone into every
Seattle's Best in the city...

55:40.756 --> 55:43.967
and any place that sells coffee
in the Broadway Belmont area.

55:46.887 --> 55:49.765
Take a look at this.
Okay.

55:50.933 --> 55:53.560
Is that too fast ?

55:53.602 --> 55:56.230
Okay, okay.
Whoa !

55:56.271 --> 55:58.899
You wanna kill me, sweetie ? Come on, get on.
I thought you were gonna impress me.

55:58.941 --> 56:01.610
Yeah, yeah.
You're so tough.

56:03.070 --> 56:06.740
Hey, you mind posting these ?
Thanks.

56:06.782 --> 56:09.410
Ma'am, we're looking for this girl.
We're trying to contact her.

56:11.078 --> 56:13.539
Totally, dude.
She comes in here all the time.

56:13.622 --> 56:19.336
We found a kid that knows her.
Seattle's Best, Lincoln and Wisconsin. All right.

56:24.425 --> 56:26.593
Thanks.
I gotta go, jess.

56:26.635 --> 56:28.762
I'm sorry.
I'm so late.

56:28.804 --> 56:30.764
Can I sneak into your room ?
No.

56:30.806 --> 56:33.017
The last time we got caught,
my dad went ballistic.

56:33.100 --> 56:35.436
Don't be sad, Jessie.
Forget about it.

56:45.320 --> 56:49.199
Yeah, I let her use the bathroom, you know.
I told the other dudes.

56:49.283 --> 56:51.535
I don't give a shit what you told the
other guy. I wanna know where she lives.

56:51.618 --> 56:55.164
I wanna know where she is.
Dude, she lives on the street.

57:12.181 --> 57:15.309
As our light goes out

57:15.392 --> 57:18.312
There's nothing left to say

57:18.395 --> 57:23.150
There's nothing left
to say or talk about

57:24.735 --> 57:29.615
You can't say
anything I don't know

57:29.698 --> 57:31.909
I already understand

57:37.873 --> 57:42.169
We gotta find this woman. Call the police if
you find this woman. Help us out here.

57:42.252 --> 57:44.213
Somebody, help.
Look at this.

57:44.296 --> 57:48.133
Call the police if you find this woman.
Help us out here.

57:52.596 --> 57:54.556
Leave me alone.

57:57.601 --> 57:59.520
Hey.
Get back here.

57:59.603 --> 58:01.814
Look at the fucking picture, all right ?
Look at the picture.

58:01.897 --> 58:04.983
You seen this girl, huh ?
No.

58:05.067 --> 58:06.985
Excuse me.
Have you seen that girl ?

58:07.069 --> 58:08.987
Look at the picture
before you answer.

58:09.071 --> 58:11.323
You seen this girl ?
Thank you. No. Sorry.

58:11.407 --> 58:13.325
See that.
That's what I want, okay ?

58:13.409 --> 58:16.495
Excuse me.
You see this girl ? Huh ?

58:16.578 --> 58:18.497
No, I haven't.
All right, thanks.

58:19.748 --> 58:22.584
You seen her?
Have you seen that girl ?

58:22.668 --> 58:25.504
Sir, have you seen this girl ?
Have you seen that girl ?

58:25.587 --> 58:27.506
Hey, hey. Stop, stop.
But I didn't do anything !

58:27.589 --> 58:29.675
I never said you did. Just look at the picture.
Have you seen this girl ?

58:29.758 --> 58:31.719
She's about your age.
Fuck you, cop. I don't know shit.

58:35.556 --> 58:37.683
You can't say

58:37.766 --> 58:40.686
Anything I don't know 

58:40.769 --> 58:44.356
Hi.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.735
Hey.
That sounds great.

58:47.776 --> 58:50.529
Yeah ? You like it ?

58:50.654 --> 58:52.698
Absolutely.

58:54.575 --> 58:58.328
Then here,
let me turn it up.

59:26.023 --> 59:30.819
If you don't tell me where she is, your friend  Jessica
will be dead within the hour.

59:30.861 --> 59:33.447
All right.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.665
She stays
on the top floor, man.

01:01:14.256 --> 01:01:16.925
Please, God.
Please, please.

01:01:30.064 --> 01:01:33.984
Please, God.
Help me please.

01:02:08.894 --> 01:02:10.229
Just up the way there.

01:02:10.229 --> 01:02:10.854
Just up the way there.

01:02:10.938 --> 01:02:13.315
Get him out of here.
Come on, come on.

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:44.456
Campbell.

01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:47.710
Campbell, you okay ?

01:08:48.877 --> 01:08:50.837
Campbell, open the door.

01:08:53.381 --> 01:08:55.384
Open it.

01:09:05.644 --> 01:09:08.897
Campbell ? You here ?

01:09:09.982 --> 01:09:11.899
Joel ?

01:09:17.656 --> 01:09:19.950
He's freezing.
Mitch, call a paramedic. Shit.

01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:22.911
This morning investigators
are stilling search...

01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:27.082
for the serial killer responsible
for last night's rampage.

01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:30.586
Three policemen were killed
and one young woman was murdered.

01:09:30.627 --> 01:09:34.715
The F.B.I. agent in charge of the task
force has been hospitalized.

01:09:41.055 --> 01:09:43.265
Hi.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:47.310
Hey, hey. Come in.

01:09:47.394 --> 01:09:50.104
You didn't have to come here.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:53.567
Yeah, well. I didn't think you
could get to me.

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:55.944
So--

01:09:56.028 --> 01:10:01.283
Besides, I don't have that many patients yet,
so I really can't afford to lose one.

01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:03.952
Yeah.

01:10:06.538 --> 01:10:10.125
I've never seen you outside the office.
You look so different.

01:10:10.209 --> 01:10:14.296
Really ? Hmm.
'Cause you look exactly the same.

01:10:18.717 --> 01:10:20.636
Yeah.

01:10:23.222 --> 01:10:25.182
Have you eaten ?

01:10:25.265 --> 01:10:27.309
Do you need to eat ?

01:10:27.393 --> 01:10:29.645
All I got is jell-O.

01:10:29.728 --> 01:10:32.147
Okay.

01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:35.109
You wanna eat ?
Yeah, let's eat.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.778
Okay.

01:11:24.033 --> 01:11:27.995
In other words, he missed you. 
Odd, isn't it ?

01:11:28.037 --> 01:11:31.832
Did you miss him ?
What the hell does that mean ?

01:11:40.215 --> 01:11:44.845
In other words, he missed you.
Odd, isn't it ?

01:11:44.887 --> 01:11:49.683
Did you miss him ?
What the hell does that mean ?

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:56.482
Look, I'm sorry. I can't talk now.
I'll call you back, all right ?

01:11:56.523 --> 01:11:58.901
Excuse me, Agent Casper ?
This just came for Agent Campbell and I just--

01:11:58.984 --> 01:12:02.654
- How did you get this ?
- The post office forwarded it from his apartment.

01:12:02.738 --> 01:12:05.240
Thank you. Shit.

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:11.080
Good morning. Thank you
for your attention.

01:12:11.163 --> 01:12:13.415
My comments today
will be brief.

01:12:13.499 --> 01:12:15.751
Uh, as many of you
know already,

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:17.920
we have received
another photograph.

01:12:18.003 --> 01:12:19.880
No, no, no.

01:12:19.963 --> 01:12:22.758
I am not going to answer
any questions today.

01:12:22.841 --> 01:12:27.221
I just am here to pass out
this photograph...

01:12:27.304 --> 01:12:32.768
and to request that you continue to assist us
in this investigation.

01:12:32.851 --> 01:12:34.937
That's all. 
Police Detective Hollis Mackie...

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.774
informing us that this horrible game
of cat and mouse will continue today.

01:12:38.857 --> 01:12:41.276
Here is the photo
of the killer's latest target.

01:12:52.496 --> 01:12:54.707
You all right ? You sure ?
Yeah.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.793
I think so.
I'll be right back.

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:06.760
Help me. Help me.

01:13:44.006 --> 01:13:48.761
Help me!

01:15:05.796 --> 01:15:08.340
Hi, Joel.

01:15:10.009 --> 01:15:12.678
How's the heart, pal ?

01:15:19.226 --> 01:15:21.895
Here.

01:15:21.979 --> 01:15:23.939
You want a beer ?

01:15:26.358 --> 01:15:28.235
It would make it
feel better.

01:15:29.486 --> 01:15:32.072
Stop.

01:15:34.825 --> 01:15:36.952
Here.

01:15:41.165 --> 01:15:44.084
Tell me something.

01:15:44.168 --> 01:15:48.213
Did you move 2,000 miles to live
near this woman's grave ?

01:15:49.923 --> 01:15:52.217
You did, didn't you ?

01:15:53.844 --> 01:15:57.931
Man, you've gotta
get out more.

01:15:58.015 --> 01:16:01.393
I mean, is this
a satisfying relationship ?

01:16:01.435 --> 01:16:04.563
You know, she loves me.
She's decomposing.

01:16:04.646 --> 01:16:07.900
She loves me.
She's decomposing.

01:16:07.941 --> 01:16:13.280
What are we doing here ? What is this ?
You here to give yourself up ?

01:16:14.948 --> 01:16:17.659
Why didn't you tell anyone
you were fucking her ?

01:16:17.743 --> 01:16:19.745
Just 'cause she was married?

01:16:19.787 --> 01:16:22.915
We don't seem to be communicating.
Let me be clear with you.

01:16:22.956 --> 01:16:27.086
I have no problem with shooting you
dead where you sit.

01:16:27.127 --> 01:16:31.757
Well, you do
have one problem.

01:16:31.799 --> 01:16:33.759
If I'm dead,

01:16:33.801 --> 01:16:36.428
your friend Polly is going to meet
a rather gruesome fate...

01:16:36.512 --> 01:16:41.308
involving candlelight and quite
a large pool of kerosene.

01:16:45.312 --> 01:16:51.151
And you know something
about attractive women burning, don't you ?

01:16:52.778 --> 01:16:55.114
Tell me, what was it like ?

01:16:55.155 --> 01:16:57.199
Could you smell
her flesh burning ?

01:17:02.871 --> 01:17:05.874
You've already killed her.

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:09.545
Come on. You know me
better than that.

01:17:09.628 --> 01:17:12.381
That's not even her blood.

01:17:12.464 --> 01:17:14.383
Take me to see her then.

01:17:15.634 --> 01:17:19.054
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:17:19.138 --> 01:17:22.307
Can't we just sit here for a little
while and talk, Joel ?

01:17:22.349 --> 01:17:24.226
We'll talk once I see her.

01:17:24.309 --> 01:17:28.397
I just need to know
if there's anything to talk about.

01:17:30.441 --> 01:17:33.235
Go on, take it.

01:17:33.318 --> 01:17:36.905
I just need to see that she's all right,
then we'll talk.

01:17:38.574 --> 01:17:40.909
Well, fine.

01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:45.247
Let's go.

01:17:49.835 --> 01:17:53.756
It's good to see you, Joel.
It really is.

01:17:55.424 --> 01:17:59.762
Wow, it's loaded.

01:18:10.397 --> 01:18:14.860
We're going to make it
through this, aren't we, Joel ?

01:18:14.902 --> 01:18:17.529
I think that's more
up to you than it is to me.

01:18:19.073 --> 01:18:21.033
You look older
since you were in L.A.

01:18:24.912 --> 01:18:27.581
You're a good friend.

01:18:27.664 --> 01:18:29.583
You're like a brother to me.

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:31.835
Did you know that ?

01:18:31.919 --> 01:18:33.879
Do you have any real
brothers or sisters ?

01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:37.007
What the fuck
What is that ?

01:18:37.049 --> 01:18:39.176
I'm trying to have
a real conversation,

01:18:39.259 --> 01:18:42.221
and you're psychoanalyzing me.

01:18:42.262 --> 01:18:45.265
- What are you, Dr. Polly now ?
- I was just curious.

01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:47.851
Look at me when I talk to you.

01:18:47.935 --> 01:18:51.522
You're trying to control this situation.
Stop trying to control this situation.

01:18:51.605 --> 01:18:55.693
Can't you just leave your job
out of this ?Just this once ?

01:18:55.776 --> 01:19:00.948
I'm telling you. I think you're spending
too much time with that Polly bitch.

01:19:01.031 --> 01:19:03.534
What do you need ?

01:19:04.993 --> 01:19:08.997
I want you to think
about what you need.

01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:11.667
It's up to me to try and get that
and make an exchange.

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:14.253
Anything you need
for Ms. Beilman's safety.

01:19:16.922 --> 01:19:20.884
What I need is you.

01:19:26.265 --> 01:19:28.851
Hold on.

01:19:28.934 --> 01:19:30.853
Hello.

01:19:30.936 --> 01:19:32.855
I knew if I just came here
and talked to you in person,

01:19:32.938 --> 01:19:36.358
you'd understand me
better, Joel.

01:19:36.442 --> 01:19:38.861
Fuck me, he's got
Campbell ! Trace it !

01:19:40.529 --> 01:19:44.700
You were the only one
who thought about me,

01:19:44.783 --> 01:19:47.202
who really knew me.

01:19:49.955 --> 01:19:52.207
For a long time,

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.293
I was the only one you had.

01:19:56.545 --> 01:19:59.089
And then you met Lisa.

01:19:59.173 --> 01:20:00.841
Pull in here.

01:21:11.578 --> 01:21:13.664
Give me a second.
Give me a second.

01:21:13.747 --> 01:21:18.002
Okay, he's about 20 miles
north of the city.

01:21:18.085 --> 01:21:20.045
Yeah, you're gonna have
to do better than that. Now come on.

01:21:20.129 --> 01:21:23.590
No shit ! Give me another minute and
we'll have his exact location.

01:21:24.883 --> 01:21:28.178
I got him ! I got him.
He's right on the water.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:49.533
Come on in.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.456
Polly, Joel.
Joel, Polly.

01:22:35.287 --> 01:22:40.584
She freak out at a damaged life
like a jailbait in the park

01:22:40.626 --> 01:22:45.589
A teenage wolf and a bloody knife
going down in the dark

01:22:45.673 --> 01:22:47.925
How to make a monster baby

01:22:47.966 --> 01:22:50.427
How to get it on

01:22:50.469 --> 01:22:52.971
How to make a monster baby

01:22:53.013 --> 01:22:55.432
How to get it on

01:22:55.474 --> 01:23:00.771
Go, go, Zombie
Go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:23:05.859 --> 01:23:10.864
Go, go, Zombie
Go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:23:36.306 --> 01:23:40.728
Roots in hell and time will tell
if your baby is insane

01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:45.733
A child bride with bloody eyes
and Satan on the brain

01:23:52.156 --> 01:23:55.701
Wakey, wakey, Joel.

01:23:55.784 --> 01:23:58.912
That hurts, doesn't it ?

01:23:58.996 --> 01:24:02.416
I've heard that flashing lights
and migraines don't go together at all.

01:24:05.419 --> 01:24:07.379
You're no fun.

01:24:10.758 --> 01:24:14.386
- Oh, no, Polly. No, no,
I'm not gonna kill him.

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.389
We need each other.
We define each other.

01:24:17.473 --> 01:24:22.895
We're... yin and yang,
black and white.

01:24:22.978 --> 01:24:27.107
- Isn't that right, Polly ?

01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:31.070
Polly ?

01:24:31.111 --> 01:24:36.075
I said, "Isn't that right ?"

01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:39.453
I don't understand
the question.

01:24:39.536 --> 01:24:41.705
Did you or did you not,
in your professional opinion,

01:24:41.747 --> 01:24:47.378
reach the conclusion that Joel and I need
each other in order to give meaning to our lives ?

01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:51.256
Yes. Yes, but I--

01:25:01.892 --> 01:25:04.353
See ?

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.081
Take your fucking
hands off her.

01:25:24.164 --> 01:25:26.250
I said take your
fucking hands off her.

01:25:30.295 --> 01:25:32.965
Sit down, Joel.

01:25:33.048 --> 01:25:35.342
Sit down.

01:25:39.138 --> 01:25:43.267
I'll sit here and listen to you talk all night.
Just take your hands off her.

01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:48.105
Come on, put the fucking gun down.
We both know you're not gonna do it.

01:25:48.188 --> 01:25:51.108
And why do we know that ?

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:53.777
Because you can
only kill her once.

01:25:54.987 --> 01:25:56.155
He's right.

01:25:56.155 --> 01:25:57.114
He's right.

01:26:16.508 --> 01:26:18.677
Upsy daisy.

01:26:23.724 --> 01:26:26.185
How's this for deja vu ?

01:26:26.226 --> 01:26:28.187
We've got the fire.

01:26:28.228 --> 01:26:30.731
We've got the pretty girl.

01:26:30.773 --> 01:26:33.692
Only instead
of bringing us together,

01:26:33.734 --> 01:26:35.819
you move to Chicago.

01:26:35.903 --> 01:26:38.322
The guilt must
have been unbearable.

01:26:39.573 --> 01:26:41.658
Or something like that.

01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:47.039
Is that what
you want me to say ?

01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:51.543
I feel guilty a woman is 
dead because I made a terrible mistake.

01:26:51.627 --> 01:26:53.879
No.

01:26:53.921 --> 01:26:56.048
No, no.
That wasn't the mistake.

01:26:56.090 --> 01:27:01.345
The mistake was turning back
instead of pouring all you had into us.

01:27:01.428 --> 01:27:05.474
What do I want you to say ?
I want you to say thank you.

01:27:05.557 --> 01:27:09.186
I want you to say thank you for coming here
and saving your pathetic life.

01:27:11.397 --> 01:27:16.735
David, do you know how many serial killers
are active in Chicago right now ?

01:27:16.819 --> 01:27:21.990
Five.
In the Midwest, at least a dozen.

01:27:22.074 --> 01:27:25.327
I could work on any one of them
without even packing a bag.

01:27:25.411 --> 01:27:29.665
You get hit by a bus on a Thursday, 
I'm working on a new guy on Monday.

01:27:29.748 --> 01:27:33.043
You're my job.
You're paperwork.

01:27:40.426 --> 01:27:43.512
I can't believe you still don't know
who you're talking to.

01:27:45.597 --> 01:27:47.933
No, no, no !

01:27:48.017 --> 01:27:51.437
No, please don't--

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.897
I have to do this.
He's not going to understand anything else.

01:27:53.981 --> 01:27:57.735
You heard him. "Paperwork. "

01:27:57.818 --> 01:28:00.696
Thank you.

01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:05.409
- What did you say ?
- I said, "Thank you."

01:28:13.167 --> 01:28:15.252
Tell me again.

01:28:16.378 --> 01:28:18.714
I said, "Thank you."

01:28:58.712 --> 01:29:00.339
Get out of here.

01:29:21.402 --> 01:29:24.697
Let's go !
Run, run !

01:29:26.198 --> 01:29:29.034
Joel !  Joel !

01:30:03.235 --> 01:30:06.822
Give me your hand !
Reach for it !

01:30:06.905 --> 01:30:11.076
Ready ? Reach.

01:30:33.807 --> 01:30:35.768
Here you go.
You all right ?

01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:44.568
Give me that blanket.

01:30:44.651 --> 01:30:46.904
Where's the girl ?
Is she all right ?

01:30:46.987 --> 01:30:48.906
She's right over there.

01:30:50.491 --> 01:30:52.409
Let's get the fucking body out.
Okay.

01:31:12.429 --> 01:31:14.682
It's never quite that easy.
You go through the door.

01:31:14.765 --> 01:31:19.687
They're never just sitting there waiting for you
with a welcoming smile on their face.

01:31:22.773 --> 01:31:27.361
The best you can do is hope they fuck up 
and do what you can to be there when they do.
