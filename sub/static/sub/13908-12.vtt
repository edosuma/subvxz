22:51.020 --> 22:54.003
THERE'S JUST...
SOMETHING
MISSING.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.019
SEE HOW THEY FLY?

22:55.021 --> 22:57.012
I'M CRYING.

22:57.014 --> 22:59.019

I'VE GOT A FEELING,
A FEELING
DEEP INSIDE.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.021
A FEELING

23:23.023 --> 23:24.020
OH, NO.

23:24.022 --> 23:25.028
OH, YEAH!

23:26.000 --> 23:29.003
YOU'RE FINISHED, MOJO,
AND SO ARE THE BEAT ALLS.

23:29.005 --> 23:30.011
I DON'T NEED THEM.

23:30.013 --> 23:32.006
NOW THAT
I'VE FOUND MOKO,

23:32.008 --> 23:38.004
OUR EVIL

23:41.026 --> 23:43.013
SHE'S FROM
THE TOWNSVILLE ZOO.

23:43.015 --> 23:44.007

24:01.022 --> 24:02.023
SHE LIVES
AT THE ZOO,

24:02.025 --> 24:05.022
AND SHE AGREED
TO HELP US STOP YOU.

24:05.024 --> 24:06.019
AGREED?

24:06.021 --> 24:07.028
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU

24:08.000 --> 24:10.008
OR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
ALWAYS DESTROYING TOWNSVILLE.

24:10.010 --> 24:12.026
SHE SAID YOU'RE
GIVING MONKEYS A BAD NAME.

24:12.028 --> 24:14.006
[CHATTERING]

24:14.008 --> 24:17.012
SO, SHE'S NOT
A PERFORMANCE CRIMINAL?

24:17.014 --> 24:19.020
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT CRIMINAL...

24:19.022 --> 24:21.023
BUT SHE IS
A PERFORMER.

24:21.025 --> 24:23.002
SHE PLAYS PIANO.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.002
BUT REMEMBER, GIRLS,

24:24.004 --> 24:27.022
SOMEDAY MONKEY WON'T
PLAY PIANO SONG,

24:27.024 --> 24:29.013
PLAY PIANO SONG.

24:29.015 --> 24:30.015
SEE YOU, GIRLS!

24:35.009 --> 24:37.010
BUT YOU TOOK
MY LOVE AWAY.

24:37.012 --> 24:39.005
WELL, IT'S LIKE

24:39.007 --> 24:41.005
THE LOVE YOU TAKE

24:41.007 --> 24:42.018
EQUAL TO--HMM...

24:42.020 --> 24:43.017
OH, WHO CARES?

24:43.019 --> 24:45.004

DUMB OLD BAND, ANYWAY.

24:45.006 --> 24:47.016
Narrator: WELL, I DON'T
REALLY WANT TO STOP THE SHOW,

24:47.018 --> 24:49.019
