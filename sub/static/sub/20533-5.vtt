WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:02.836
Previously on 90210:

00:02.878 --> 00:04.463
I told you,
I slept with you in Vegas

00:04.505 --> 00:05.881
because I thought Dixon
and I weren't together.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.382
It's not gonna happen again.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.759
I've got one shot to
make a name for myself,

00:08.801 --> 00:10.135
and I have to knock it
out of the park.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.637
A guy in a leg brace
does not scream

00:11.679 --> 00:12.805
"kick-ass opening act."

00:12.847 --> 00:14.890
ANNIE:
Whoa!

00:14.932 --> 00:15.933
Where did that come from?

00:15.975 --> 00:17.601
PENNY:
Want to feel sexy?

00:17.643 --> 00:18.811
Try dancing in front of
a live audience.

00:18.853 --> 00:19.979
There's nothing like it.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.980
You know where I could sign up?

00:21.062 --> 00:23.064
ALEC:
You and Max are a mistake,

00:23.106 --> 00:25.400
and I am not gonna let you
ruin his life.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.986
Max, Alec set me up.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.280
He kissed me and had someone
take photos of us.
He was trying to prove that

00:30.322 --> 00:32.240
you had cheated on me once,
and that you would do it again.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.492
How was your fantasy weekend?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.787
Max and I
hit a bit of a speed bump.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.497
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.585
♪ ♪

00:48.883 --> 00:50.425
Hey. Liam.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.969
Is Navid around?

00:52.011 --> 00:54.889
He has been after me for days to
come see what he is doing here.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.265
I'm not really sure where
he... where he is, so...

00:57.307 --> 00:59.476
Okay.
Well, I'll just come back.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.770
I only had
a few minutes anyway.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.147
Hey.
How are you doing?

01:04.188 --> 01:06.608
Uh, with the whole...
baby-making thing?

01:06.650 --> 01:09.486
Sorry, this is kind of weird
for me to ask, but are you...?

01:09.528 --> 01:10.654
Pregnant? No.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.864
Not yet.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.073
But it is still surprising

01:13.114 --> 01:14.909
that I am disappointed
to say that at 20.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.118
Yeah.
What's up with you?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.747
Oh, just... shooting this
frontal lobotomy of a movie,

01:19.788 --> 01:21.790
and, uh, actually
giving school a go.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.417
Good for you.
Yeah.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.919
I thought a business class
could really help

01:24.960 --> 01:26.253
in expanding the bar.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.255
Teacher really knows her stuff.
I could learn a lot.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.924
Except she's got it in for me.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.133
A teacher doesn't
like Liam Court? No!

01:32.175 --> 01:33.802
Yeah.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.470
Yeah, she thinks
I'm some dumb actor,

01:35.512 --> 01:37.598
wants me to drop her class.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.600
Hey, you were always
a teacher's pet.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.476
I was always a good student.
There's a difference.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.937
Meh...
Yeah.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.897
No, for real, though.
What do you think I should do?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.815
I mean, I spent all this time
making this business plan,

01:46.857 --> 01:48.316
and she won't even read it.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.235
Successful businessmen don't let
anything stand in their way.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.987
They either go
around the obstacle

01:52.029 --> 01:53.614
or just plow right
through it, right?
Yeah.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.991
Human bulldozer
really isn't my style.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.201
Well, sometimes you
got to switch it up.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.661
You might even
surprise yourself.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.789
I am glad we're talking again.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.164
I really miss it.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
Me, too.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.092
Sorry, I didn't realize

02:13.133 --> 02:14.885
you were both here.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.596
Hugging. Uh...

02:17.638 --> 02:19.807
Place is starting to look
like something again, huh?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.058
Yeah. It really is.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.059
Good job, you guys.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.393
Yeah, it's been, like, 24/7.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.729
Need it ready for the Pop Up,
it's gonna be huge.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.982
Uh, oh, I think I'm getting...
I really want to hear
about all of this,

02:28.023 --> 02:30.734
but I don't have time right now.
I have an appointment.
Oh...

02:30.776 --> 02:33.112
It's another one of those
doctor/baby things.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.280
It's endless.
Um, let's catch up later?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.824
Uh, yeah.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.075
Okay. Bye.
LIAM:
See you.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.913
Hey, uh...

02:42.955 --> 02:44.205
Liam, to be honest, uh,

02:44.247 --> 02:47.208
I'm not cool with how you
handled the whole Dixon thing.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.919
It's not gonna be good
for anyone if he bombs.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.921
Well, I think he
deserves a shot.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.255
Well, the Pop Up
is kind of my thing.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.674
Okay? Well, mine and Taylor's.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.009
It's our event.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.928
Yeah, at my venue.
Okay, but I spent
a lot of time and cash

02:57.970 --> 02:59.178
to get this place ready.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.555
I need to be able
to make decisions...

03:00.597 --> 03:02.557
Okay, look, look, Navid.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.309
I know that I've been
a little half-assed

03:04.351 --> 03:05.602
about this place sometimes,

03:05.644 --> 03:07.270
but I'm taking it
more seriously now.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.188
And as long as
I own the place,

03:09.230 --> 03:10.816
I have some say
in what goes on.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.233
You know, maybe
we should have

03:12.275 --> 03:14.277
a little bit more of
a formal agreement.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.403
No, dude,
dude, we're friends.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.571
I know, I know.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.657
It's better to hammer
this stuff out now,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.617
and just avoid
misunderstandings later.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.119
So... what?

03:22.161 --> 03:23.996
You want to hire a lawyer?

03:24.997 --> 03:26.331
Yeah.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.624
Yeah, I think I do.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.334
Actually, I know
the perfect one.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.342
You two are the most important
people in the world to me.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.594
Which means,
from here on in,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.055
you're gonna get along.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.849
No more mind games,
and no more underhanded jabs.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.308
Do I make myself clear?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.144
Absolutely.
100%.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.147
Okay, then. Group hug.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.440
Come on.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.483
Come on, all together.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.776
(cell phone chimes)
Uh-oh.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.947
The coders are stuck again.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.448
I got to go. Um... we good?

04:00.490 --> 04:01.449
Right?
Absolutely.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.160
Of course.
Okay.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.539
My husband wants us
to get along;

04:07.581 --> 04:08.874
I want what he wants.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.500
Do you actually plan on
putting an effort in for real?

04:10.542 --> 04:11.626
Of course.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.005
Max won't be aware
of any discord.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.382
(laughing):
Okay.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.009
If you're taking this
underground, Alec,

04:19.051 --> 04:20.886
make no mistake:

04:20.928 --> 04:22.721
I'll meet you there.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.606
Colin, I have to say
I'm kind of enjoying this.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.482
What do you mean, "kind of"?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.693
I really like
spending time with you.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.905
(knocking at door)

04:39.947 --> 04:41.406
Oh, well.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.575
Kissing while eating Mexican's
kind of dicey anyway.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.872
Where's Dixon?

04:48.914 --> 04:50.624
Hmm. Well, hello
to you, too, Riley.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.667
Dixon's not here.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.377
Well, I think I'll wait.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.088
Come on in.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.006
Colin, this is Riley,
Dixon's physical therapist.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.050
Hey, man.
You like mole?

05:00.092 --> 05:02.010
No, I'm not really
a fan of Mexican.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.595
Oh, this is Oaxacan.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.430
Which is in Mexico.
Right, I just meant

05:05.472 --> 05:07.474
that particular region
has really great food.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.227
Even people who don't
like Mexican like Oaxacan.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.519
Not to mention the tequila.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.564
We're talking the authentic
stuff, with the worm.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.523
Wow.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.817
Did Dixon say
when he'd be back?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.318
No, he didn't.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.403
But, you know, you don't have
to wait if you don't want to.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.447
I know, but I will.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.038
TAYLOR:
Pop Up at the Offshore

05:30.080 --> 05:32.624
this Saturday.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.252
Invitation only,
surprise guest, one night only.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.544
I want you to be there,

05:36.586 --> 05:38.880
and trust me...
you want to be there.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.133
DIXON:
What's up, guys?
How's it going?

05:41.175 --> 05:43.468
It's going over the top.
How's it going with you, my man?

05:43.510 --> 05:45.428
Uh, you know, getting stronger.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.763
Uh, setting up, getting ready.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.183
How about you, Navid?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.851
Hey, Taylor,
can you give us a sec?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.853
You bet.
Thanks, man.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.230
Look, Dixon,
I-I didn't mean to be a jerk.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.564
You didn't?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.317
Oh, man, that means you just
hit it out of the park

05:58.357 --> 05:59.776
without even trying.
Hey.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.945
Just, this Pop Up has been
a huge amount of pressure on me.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.071
I can handle pressure.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.447
Yeah, you can.
It's me I'm worried about.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.158
I really need
this thing to take off.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.618
It's something I'm good at,
I could really be a player,

06:08.660 --> 06:10.078
get noticed.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.121
(laughs)

06:11.163 --> 06:12.122
By Silver.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.874
By everyone.
Mostly by Silver.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.125
Well, yes, fine.
It wouldn't suck

06:15.167 --> 06:16.335
if Silver happened to
see what she was missing.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.461
I... it's okay, I get it.
You do?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.462
Hey.
Hey.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.672
Sorry.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.882
Uh, Navid, Megan.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.924
Hi.
Hey.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.260
Uh, we-we met in-in, um...

06:25.302 --> 06:26.720
In our support group

06:26.761 --> 06:28.596
for people who are totally
messed up in the head.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.890
Yeah.
Ah.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.059
Actually, Dixon's the only
one keeping me together.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.643
Well, and the drugs.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.437
Hi. Kidding.
Oh.
(laughs)

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
That was a good one.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.690
Uh, Navid's actually
throwing the Pop Up

06:38.732 --> 06:40.317
that I'm playing at.
Cool.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.111
Yeah, invite only,
surprise guest, one night only.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.403
I want you to be there,

06:44.445 --> 06:46.114
and trust me...
you want to be there.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.407
Then I guess
I should be there.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.784
Uh, you know what,
I got to go.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.036
My English lit professor

06:51.078 --> 06:52.996
makes us recite Shakespeare
when we come in late.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.413
Uh, well, hey, take a few more,
spread the word.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.166
Yeah, sure. Later.
Thanks.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.625
Good call, man.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.044
She's hot.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.462
Hey, Dixon.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.548
Do you want to...
Pop Up?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.466
Offshore. Invitation only.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.344
Thanks, but my boyfriend
already invited me.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.097
Hey, uh, Dixon, do you want
to go grab some lunch?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.723
Uh, I'm not really
that hungry.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.934
Actually, I got to start
planning my set list.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.269
ADRIANNA:
Okay. Don't forget,

07:15.310 --> 07:16.603
you have physical
therapy later.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.314
Okay?
Yeah, I know I have
physical therapy, okay?

07:19.356 --> 07:21.149
It's not like I can forget.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.402
I'm... babe, I'm sorry.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.778
Uh, it's just...

07:24.819 --> 07:26.487
it's just, everybody's been
on my back about it lately,

07:26.529 --> 07:27.864
you know, so...

07:27.906 --> 07:29.157
It's fine.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.201
I will stay out of your way.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.914
Girls.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.129
Well, we're just thrilled
that you're on board, Mr. Court.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.047
Welcome.
Well, I look forward
to getting to work.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.715
Great.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.050
Lindsey.
Thanks for joining us.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.344
I wanted you
to meet a new client.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.389
New client?

07:52.431 --> 07:53.848
Yes. Liam Court.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.183
Mr. Court has retained the firm,

07:55.225 --> 07:56.684
and specifically asked
to work with you.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.353
Oh, I know who he is.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.063
He's a student of mine at CU.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.357
Really?
Unfortunately,
that's a conflict for me.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.817
Good news.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.861
Remember how you wanted me
to drop your class?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.905
Great! Then the first
order of business

08:08.947 --> 08:10.782
is an employment agreement.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.034
Uh, someone at his bar
is looking to get some equity.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.163
So I'll let Liam
fill you in on the details.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.332
Mr. Court, pleasure.
Hey.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.541
See you soon.
All right.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.085
Good guy.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.629
Do you even know what equity is?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.840
Don't you remember the
return on equity projections

08:26.881 --> 08:29.843
in the business plan that
I submitted for your class?

08:29.884 --> 08:32.679
Gee. Must not have read
it very carefully.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.054
I probably didn't get to it

08:34.097 --> 08:36.140
because I was prioritizing
the work of real students.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.851
Well, now that I'm
a paying client,

08:37.892 --> 08:40.937
I guess you will have to make me
a priority, won't you?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.651
(theme music playing)

09:03.751 --> 09:05.795
Alec's meeting ends at 7:00.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.130
I just need you

09:07.172 --> 09:09.299
to bump into him, ask him
if he wants to have a drink,

09:09.341 --> 09:10.884
and keep him busy long enough

09:10.925 --> 09:12.260
for me to poke
around his office.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.138
If Max wants you to
stop feuding with Alec,

09:15.180 --> 09:16.515
then why don't you?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.850
Because he's trying
to break up our marriage.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.311
Besides, if I could just
get something on Alec,

09:21.353 --> 09:23.313
then maybe, just maybe,

09:23.355 --> 09:25.815
I'd be able to neutralize him.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.442
Wow, "neutralize."

09:27.484 --> 09:28.735
That is very CIA of you.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.154
Okay. Yeah, fine.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.448
Then "blackmail."

09:33.490 --> 09:35.116
Either way, we both know

09:35.158 --> 09:37.285
I could kick his ass
if that doesn't work out.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.328
SILVER:
All right, look.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.413
I am only doing this because

09:39.454 --> 09:40.788
I know that you'll
harass me until I do,

09:40.830 --> 09:41.873
and I don't have
time for that.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.167
Really, what else
do you have to do?

09:44.209 --> 09:47.837
Or rather, who do you
have to do?

09:47.879 --> 09:50.006
Silver, are you finally

09:50.048 --> 09:51.632
giving up your
tortured art girl look?

09:51.674 --> 09:53.260
It's from Halloween.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.511
Uh-huh.
Last year.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.970
Oh, right,
when you were a hot dog?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.138
Who is he?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.432
We know you've been
sneaking around with someone.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.058
If you want me to
go and do this,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.351
then I have to go
and do this.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.937
NAVID:
Hello! I come bearing gifts!

10:03.978 --> 10:06.356
Hey. Invites to the Pop Up...
okay.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.359
Uh, here you are, Naomi.
And here you are, Silver.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.528
You were my next stop.
Thanks, I already
got one from Liam.

10:11.570 --> 10:12.820
Oh, okay.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.988
Uh, uh, you're coming, right?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.365
Definitely gonna try, yeah.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.908
What, "try?"
Well, you have to come.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.119
Nelly Furtado's performing,
one night only.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.371
Navid, chill out.
We will be there,

10:21.413 --> 10:23.164
but right now,
we have to go.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.416
Where you going?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.460
Girl stuff.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.128
But we will be there
at your event with bells on.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.046
Ta!
Uh...

10:30.088 --> 10:32.799
ADRIANNA:
Dixon has been
so touchy lately.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.385
Yeah, he lashes out
at me, too,

10:35.427 --> 10:37.471
but it's normal, considering
what he's going through.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.973
Yeah, I guess.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.433
I don't know, I just,

10:41.475 --> 10:43.268
I feel so far away
from him right now.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.187
I don't know if it's him,
or if it's me...

10:46.229 --> 10:47.897
It's definitely
not you, Ade.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.065
You love him.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.442
Yeah, of course I do.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.819
I just want to feel
close again, you know?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.821
And it's like we can't get
back at it.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.492
We don't connect,
we don't have sex.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.785
Sorry, you didn't have
to hear that.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
(chuckles)
Oh, it's fine. I...

11:02.329 --> 11:04.414
Yeah, I so didn't
need to hear that.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.166
Sorry.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.419
Just, I don't know if it's me,

11:09.461 --> 11:11.546
or the injury,

11:11.588 --> 11:14.257
or maybe I'm expecting something
that he can't do.

11:14.299 --> 11:17.302
It's not like I can just
come out and ask him,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.304
not with everything else
going on.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.765
I just feel so stupid.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.559
Oh.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.814
LINDSEY:
If you want to give
Navid Shirazi

11:29.856 --> 11:31.608
equity in the business,
this contract

11:31.650 --> 11:33.401
has a vesting schedule.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.903
Do you know what that means?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.367
I appreciate your expertise,
but I could do

11:40.408 --> 11:42.494
without the patronizing
and condescension.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.078
Patronizing and condescension
are redundant.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.746
Well, I thought
I would use both

11:45.788 --> 11:48.291
to best indicate the scale
of your attitude.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.877
Look, I know what I want.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.295
So here's an idea--

11:52.337 --> 11:53.712
how about you
actually listen to me?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.674
I'm trying to expedite
this process

11:55.714 --> 11:57.384
and save you expensive
attorney fees.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.386
What's this?

11:59.427 --> 12:00.595
That's my business plan

12:00.637 --> 12:01.720
that you wouldn't read.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
I don't recall reading this

12:03.181 --> 12:04.765
being part
of the retainer agreement.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.725
Mmm, well, if you had read
the retainer,

12:06.767 --> 12:08.603
you would have seen
the definition on page four

12:08.645 --> 12:11.189
under miscellaneous business.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.233
That's funny, though.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.901
I thought attention to detail
was your thing.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.571
Don't presume to know
what my thing is.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.197
I want your notes by Saturday.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.241
You can drop them
by the Offshore.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.867
I have plans Saturday.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.035
Oh, well, I thought

12:24.077 --> 12:25.579
your boss assured me
that all services

12:25.620 --> 12:27.163
were client-centered.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.874
Do I need to call him
to clarify?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.838
See you.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.783
♪ ♪

13:20.049 --> 13:21.426
(door opening)

13:21.468 --> 13:23.553
Oh, crap.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.122
You really should
have a cleaning crew

13:51.164 --> 13:52.290
come in here more often.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.708
If you're trying
to take me down,

13:53.750 --> 13:57.128
you'll have to do better than
that drinks with Silver ruse.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.505
Oh, that was Silver's idea.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
She thinks you're hot,
bless her heart.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.675
Save it, Naomi.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.551
You're way out
of your league.

14:03.593 --> 14:07.013
I'll always be one
step ahead of you.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.683
So why not maintain what
little dignity you have left

14:09.724 --> 14:11.850
and give up?

14:11.892 --> 14:13.770
(chuckles) Because, Alec,

14:13.812 --> 14:16.648
I never give up.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.954
Sorry to ruin your movie date.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.582
I'm back early. Silver is going
to get a piece of my mind.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.544
She couldn't keep Alec
away for one hour. 'Scusie.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.170
My bad for thinking
we could get

14:39.212 --> 14:40.672
a little peace and quiet here.
That's okay.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.964
It was nice while it lasted.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.591
(exhales)

14:43.633 --> 14:44.967
What happened?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.303
(groans)
I was just getting started

14:47.345 --> 14:49.848
when Alec showed up
and knew exactly where I was.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.349
Wait, he knew exactly
where you were?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.226
Yeah, it was freaky.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.977
Give me your phone.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.229
Let me check your
network settings.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.606
Okay.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.233
(beeps)

15:04.195 --> 15:05.655
Yeah, look right here.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.074
He's been using your GPS
to track your location.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.326
He hacked her?
God.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.203
Now, I assume you'd like
to reverse this pathway

15:12.245 --> 15:15.540
and get full access
to his phone, so you open

15:15.582 --> 15:18.167
this window here
and you have access

15:18.209 --> 15:19.836
to his e-mail account.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.880
Oh!
Oh, my God.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.798
You are the best thing ever.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.800
Do not mess this up.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.470
Oh, boy, you just gave kerosene
and matches to a pyromaniac.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.347
Boring, boring, boring.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.141
God, his e-mails are even more
boring than his personality.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.935
Whoa! E-mails to Madison.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.437
A ton of them.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
So? She was gonna marry Max.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.732
It's not like they
didn't know each other.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.191
They're about me.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.903
He was pressuring her to hire me
to plan her wedding.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.905
Why was he invested in
having me plan the wedding?

15:46.946 --> 15:47.988
He knew I would ruin it.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.324
Oh, my... (laughs)
This is awesome.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.951
How are you gonna tell
your husband this?

15:51.992 --> 15:54.788
"Oh, I just happened
to be tapping Alec's phone."

15:54.829 --> 15:57.665
Annie, you are such
a wet blanket today.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.334
I'm gonna have Madison do it.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.378
Why would she ever?

16:02.420 --> 16:05.381
Clearly, you forget
how charming Naomi can be

16:05.423 --> 16:07.216
when she wants something.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.302
Thank you, little geek.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.098
(applause)

16:16.100 --> 16:17.393
Beautiful.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.686
You're a natural.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.939
A natural, yeah. It's like
I was born in this thing.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.816
All you need to do is get
your own distinctive persona,

16:22.857 --> 16:25.735
starting with a stage name.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.487
Is that the thing where
you take your dog's name

16:27.528 --> 16:29.238
and add it to the
street you grew up on?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.115
No, honey, that's for porn.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.659
This is an actual art form.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.743
You've got a great first name.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.411
Thanks. It's, um...
it's my last name,

16:35.453 --> 16:37.622
but I don't want to use
any of my real name.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.416
You know, I just wanted to
try this thing out on my own

16:40.458 --> 16:42.502
without any pressure,
no gossip, no anything,

16:42.543 --> 16:44.337
so I haven't told
any of my friends.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.298
I get it.
It really is your alter ego.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.300
Though it's weird,
hiding it from everyone.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.427
I mean, they know
I'm up to something.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.846
Then tell someone.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.013
They'll love it.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.807
Yeah, I know someone who would.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.016
Yeah, friend, boyfriend?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.142
Complicated,

16:58.184 --> 17:01.270
but we're just starting
to become friends again.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.692
See you tomorrow.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.570
Dude, I'm so excited
for tonight.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.906
I just made
some minor tweaks and...

17:14.701 --> 17:16.493
(groans)
Man, you okay?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.744
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.747
I-I looked it up online,

17:19.789 --> 17:22.208
and it said it's probably
just nerves waking up,

17:22.249 --> 17:23.501
and that's good news, right?

17:23.542 --> 17:26.546
Yeah, yeah, or it could be
more neuropathy,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.089
which means you should probably
see a doctor.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.216
No, not until after tonight.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.718
I talked my way into this,
and...

17:31.759 --> 17:33.260
there's no way in hell

17:33.302 --> 17:34.888
I'm letting anything get
in the way of this.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.015
Okay.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.518
Hey, Dixon.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.728
Riley.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.770
How's it going?

17:42.812 --> 17:43.980
How's what going?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.399
I don't know,
whatever you guys were doing.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.317
Uh, great. Everything's...
everything's great.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.944
I'm great,
Riley, you're great, right?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.111
Always.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.947
All right.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.825
Okay.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.869
Yeah.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.287
Hey, uh, can I ask you
a question?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.789
I can't promise I'll answer.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.333
Yeah.
Okay, well, um,

18:04.375 --> 18:07.921
all right,
if-if someone is injured,

18:07.962 --> 18:11.215
are there any, um,

18:11.257 --> 18:14.928
limitations with...

18:14.969 --> 18:18.014
I don't know, um, intimacy?

18:18.056 --> 18:21.893
Are you asking me what it's like
to bonk a guy in a wheelchair?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.352
No! No.
Uh-huh.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.646
Well, yeah, a little bit,
a little bit,

18:25.688 --> 18:26.898
but not for me.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.358
Just 'cause I'm asking
for a friend.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.069
Okay, well, um,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.320
the mechanics
are pretty straightforward.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.156
I mean, it depends
on the injury, you know.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.951
Sometimes the parts work,
sometimes they don't,

18:37.992 --> 18:40.160
but, um, like, for instance,

18:40.202 --> 18:41.996
I don't have any feeling
below my waist,

18:42.038 --> 18:43.081
but I have a lot

18:43.122 --> 18:44.498
above my waist,
so my pleasure comes

18:44.540 --> 18:46.000
from giving
my partners pleasure.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.961
Riley, I didn't mean to...
No.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.087
No, it's, uh...

18:49.128 --> 18:50.254
it's no sweat.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.465
You know, it is what it is.
I was asking

18:52.506 --> 18:54.884
about Dixon for Adrianna.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.428
They're, um...

18:57.470 --> 19:00.347
She is, uh, having a hard time.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.557
Right, uh, well,

19:01.599 --> 19:04.351
Dixon's injuries
are less severe than mine,

19:04.393 --> 19:06.479
so my guess is that his parts
probably work,

19:06.520 --> 19:08.606
but not... not that I'm looking

19:08.648 --> 19:10.024
into his business
or anything. (laughs)

19:10.066 --> 19:11.275
Nope, nope, me, neither.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.319
Annie, you know,

19:13.360 --> 19:16.572
sex isn't just about the parts.

19:16.614 --> 19:20.409
I mean, one thing
that I learned from...

19:20.451 --> 19:22.745
from my experience is that,
um, you know, these injuries,

19:22.787 --> 19:24.956
they don't suddenly
make you a new person.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.707
Whatever problems
you had before,

19:26.749 --> 19:29.627
whether it's with yourself
or with your partner,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.462
they don't disappear.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.591
You know, you can't blame it
on the injury.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.845
Thank you, Riley.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.471
Yeah.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.974
It's no sweat.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.266
Hey, by the way,

19:44.308 --> 19:46.102
if you do want
to buy me dinner sometime,

19:46.144 --> 19:47.520
you still might get lucky.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.647
(chuckles)

19:51.565 --> 19:55.361
Um, yeah, well, we've got one
installed here, and then, uh,

19:55.402 --> 19:56.570
another one over here.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.864
Here, I'll just show you.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.532
This way.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.159
(phone chirps)

20:01.200 --> 20:03.703
Hey, Liam, your phone's buzzing.

20:20.178 --> 20:23.389
Have you noticed anything
between, uh, Silver and Liam?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.683
(laughs) No.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.602
I can't keep track
of all the drama in your crew.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.312
Why are you so hung up

20:30.354 --> 20:31.564
with that one girl?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.566
This is L.A.
You have a club.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.276
Girls are low-hanging fruit.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.611
LIAM:
Guys, please be careful

20:37.653 --> 20:38.821
with those extra lights.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.031
Oh, and the fire inspector said

20:40.073 --> 20:41.157
we can't use the generator.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.867
Yeah, well, this place
has to look good.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.618
It's not, like,
some janky amateur hour.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.537
Dude, we're on the
same team here.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.664
We just got to play
by the rules, okay?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.010
Madison?

21:01.052 --> 21:03.888
Naomi? What are you doing here?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.472
This is a place of
rest and beauty,

21:05.514 --> 21:07.100
and you are a...

21:07.141 --> 21:08.642
A well-intentioned victim
of circumstance

21:08.684 --> 21:10.061
come to make things right?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.771
(exhales)
I know, I suck.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.773
I'm sorry. You have every right
to hate my guts,

21:13.814 --> 21:16.776
but I just so happened
to see you here.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.902
I'm genuinely sorry

21:17.944 --> 21:19.779
for how everything went down

21:19.820 --> 21:21.447
with Max and the wedding,
I really am.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.365
Got it. Now, go away.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.409
I have finally found happiness
with someone else,

21:25.451 --> 21:27.036
and I don't want you
ruining that, too.

21:27.078 --> 21:30.164
Oh, my God,
I'm so happy for you.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.832
(sighs)

21:31.874 --> 21:34.127
It's almost as if

21:34.168 --> 21:35.878
it all happened for the best.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.713
Still, I suck, I know.

21:37.755 --> 21:38.839
I'm sorry.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.008
Nothing excuses the fact
that you are vulgar

21:41.050 --> 21:42.426
and hateful,

21:42.468 --> 21:44.678
but my newfound happiness
does help me to forgive.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.805
Well, that's awesome.

21:45.846 --> 21:49.725
And since we're past that,

21:49.767 --> 21:51.936
(chuckles)
I was wondering about Alec.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.062
(groans)

21:53.104 --> 21:55.022
Alec. What about him?

21:55.064 --> 21:57.483
Did he pressure you into hiring
me as your wedding planner?

21:57.524 --> 21:59.944
Alec barely acknowledged Max
and I were even getting married.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.404
Well, until my first planner
fell through at the last minute,

22:02.446 --> 22:05.199
and then all the other people
I tried were unavailable.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.660
Then Alec suggested you.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.289
So, Alec ignores you,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.540
and then, suddenly,

22:13.582 --> 22:15.084
rushes in and saves the day,

22:15.126 --> 22:17.253
finding you
a new wedding planner,

22:17.295 --> 22:18.921
who happens to be
Max's ex-girlfriend

22:18.963 --> 22:20.089
and love of his life?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.132
No offense.

22:21.174 --> 22:25.219
And you think that's, um,

22:25.261 --> 22:26.428
coincidence?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.765
Well, maybe not.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.349
But what do you care?

22:31.391 --> 22:33.186
You got what you wanted--
you got Max.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.562
Yeah, and I got
Alec along with him.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.564
He's gunning for me now.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.774
Madison, I would

22:38.816 --> 22:42.528
not expect you to say yes
to this, but my friend Navid

22:42.569 --> 22:44.404
is throwing a Pop Up
at the Offshore.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.866
Max and Alec will both be there.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.910
Maybe you could
come down and help me get

22:49.952 --> 22:52.621
the truth out finally
into the open?

22:52.663 --> 22:55.333
Show Max what kind of person
his business partner

22:55.373 --> 22:56.374
really is.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.793
Why would I ever...
No.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.129
Not for me.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.255
For Max.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.341
You're a forgiving,

23:03.381 --> 23:07.178
kind, beautiful soul
and you loved him once.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.056
I mean, if his best friend
is dead set on sabotaging

23:10.097 --> 23:11.349
all of his relationships,

23:11.389 --> 23:13.893
don't you think Max
deserves to know?

23:13.934 --> 23:17.813
Don't you think Max deserves
a chance at happiness, too?

23:27.823 --> 23:30.868
♪ ♪

23:41.587 --> 23:45.258
Okay, so I still can't
believe that I did this,

23:45.299 --> 23:48.594
but I had a talk
with Riley about things.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.180
Not "things" literally.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.682
Well, actually kind of literally
if you really think about it.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.226
You talked to Riley about sex?

23:55.268 --> 23:58.562
Yeah, but he was surprisingly
cool about it all.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.855
First, Dixon

23:59.897 --> 24:01.274
is probably fine.

24:01.315 --> 24:04.360
I mean, physically with...
you know.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.443
Um, and...

24:05.485 --> 24:08.572
with Riley,
it's a little more complicated.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.616
Not that you
needed to know that.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.076
Not that I needed to know that.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.452
Even though I think he wanted me
to know that, which is weird.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.705
So?
So,

24:16.747 --> 24:19.375
Riley said that sometimes
in these situations,

24:19.417 --> 24:23.670
people blame their problems
on an accident

24:23.712 --> 24:25.881
or disability,
but a lot of the time,

24:25.923 --> 24:27.758
the problems already existed.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.051
What are you saying?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.804
I guess I'm saying that...

24:31.845 --> 24:35.308
maybe the real question is:

24:35.349 --> 24:37.517
How was your relationship
before the accident?

24:55.702 --> 24:57.079
Hey.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.998
Hey, you made it.

24:59.039 --> 24:59.999
Why you acting so surprised?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.208
You think I can't dance?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.877
Oh, I didn't think you were
the club kind of guy.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.422
Well, I'm not. No, I was
actually just here to, uh,

25:06.464 --> 25:08.132
check out the ramps.
Good incline.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.050
Sailed right up it.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.760
Nice.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.221
So, where's your man,
the world traveler?

25:14.263 --> 25:15.181
Colin is stuck at work.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.682
Okay, well, if you
want, I can, uh...

25:16.723 --> 25:18.434
I can sit here
and just spit out

25:18.476 --> 25:20.769
some crap I read
in Travel and Leisure for you.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.646
Hey, remember yesterday
when you were not a dick

25:22.688 --> 25:25.107
for like five minutes?
Can we do more of that?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.860
It depends. You going
to ask me more sex questions?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.321
Okay, I'm sorry.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.031
That was a joke. Ha, ha.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.531
And actually,

25:33.573 --> 25:36.910
truth be told, I kind of
enjoyed not being a dick

25:36.952 --> 25:38.912
for five minutes and just
talking to you, so...

25:40.538 --> 25:42.041
Want to get a drink?

25:42.082 --> 25:44.835
Yeah, let's do that.
Yeah.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.391
Per your request.

25:58.432 --> 26:01.435
A quick approval
would be appreciated.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.397
You're not in the least bit
interested in seeing the place?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.023
Why would I be?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.274
And what do you care?

26:07.316 --> 26:09.026
I don't.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.154
I... I just thought that,
you know, since you're working

26:12.196 --> 26:14.948
for me, it might be nice
for you to actually experience

26:14.990 --> 26:16.409
the business described
in the business plan.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.868
It's not that complicated.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.827
None of this is.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.704
You got me all
figured out, don't you?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.373
Unless there's nuances
beyond the good hair

26:22.415 --> 26:24.083
and "I'm gonna blow
your brains out."

26:26.960 --> 26:29.171
You saw my movie.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.881
So what?

26:30.923 --> 26:33.551
I just find it interesting
that you're so put off by me,

26:33.591 --> 26:35.553
yet you took the time
to see Corporate Invaders.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.887
It's not interesting, Liam.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.138
I had a coupon.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.848
Now, will you sign off
on the revision

26:39.890 --> 26:41.225
so I can go?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.185
Sure.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.396
After I read and review them.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.856
So, sit down, relax,
have a drink.

26:49.567 --> 26:50.608
(laughs)

26:50.650 --> 26:52.111
Or just stand there with
that look on your face.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.237
Whatever floats your boat.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.249
Dixon, hey.
Hey.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.750
All the world's a stage,

27:06.792 --> 27:09.378
and all men and women
merely players.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.464
Shakespeare.

27:11.505 --> 27:15.175
I was late for class, but I
thought it sort of applied.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.385
This place is really cool.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.844
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.388
Oh, no, no, I'm just glad...

27:19.430 --> 27:20.638
Are you okay?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.057
Mmm.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.101
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, it's...

27:24.143 --> 27:27.645
It's just nerves,
literally.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.565
Uh, I'll see you
after the show, huh?

27:29.607 --> 27:31.066
Yeah, I'll be,
uh, the groupie

27:31.108 --> 27:32.943
waiting around to
meet the rock star.
Ah.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.571
See you.
All right.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.739
Hey, I wanted to
wish you good luck.
Hey.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.366
I know how important
tonight is.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.494
Yeah, thank you.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.829
Hey, Dixon, when
this is over,

27:43.870 --> 27:46.706
do you think we could
talk about stuff?

27:46.748 --> 27:47.707
Talk about what?

27:47.749 --> 27:48.917
Well, I've been thinking.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.836
Before the accident,
our relationship was...

27:50.877 --> 27:52.838

Hey!

28:02.139 --> 28:04.224
Our relationship
is important to me.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.977
Yeah, and my career's
important to me, all right?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.273

Madison.

Hi.
Hi.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.719
This is a surprise.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.802
Madison and I ran

29:22.844 --> 29:23.970
into each other at the spa.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.599
And, in the spirit
of putting things behind us,

29:26.640 --> 29:27.766
I invited her here tonight.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.435
I'm so glad you decided to come.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.064
Madison came here tonight
because she wanted

29:34.106 --> 29:35.482
to tell you
something.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.317
Madison, how nice to see you.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.612
Yeah, you, too.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.114
Anyway...
Uh,

29:42.155 --> 29:43.574
gosh, I hate
to duck out, but, uh,

29:43.616 --> 29:44.617
there's something
going on at work.

29:44.658 --> 29:45.576
Um, I'll be right back,

29:45.618 --> 29:47.536
and... and we'll talk, okay?

29:47.578 --> 29:51.206
Oh. Hmm.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.295
What are you doing?

29:56.336 --> 29:59.256
I'm not doing anything.

29:59.298 --> 30:03.009
Madison is dying to tell Max
about how you pressured her

30:03.051 --> 30:06.513
into hiring me
as her wedding planner.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.847
Madison,

30:07.889 --> 30:10.601
I'm so sorry that Max
had to step away,

30:10.643 --> 30:13.353
but I really think
it's unfair to subject you

30:13.395 --> 30:16.356
to the droning of Alec's voice,
so would you like to dance?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.857
Oh, with you?

30:17.899 --> 30:20.402
(laughs) Honey, it's time
to get your swerve on.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.712
You okay?

30:38.754 --> 30:41.840
Not really.

30:41.881 --> 30:46.011
I guess the problems Dixon and I
were having before the accident

30:46.052 --> 30:47.429
never really went away.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.598
Did you think
they ever really did?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.017
Wishful thinking?

don't even know why anymore.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.742

Okay, what was all that about?

38:59.378 --> 39:00.297
Celebrity sex tape.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.882
My club just
hit the big time!

39:02.924 --> 39:05.260
Oh, God...

39:05.302 --> 39:07.262
Who is that?

39:07.304 --> 39:08.638
It's Liam!

39:10.431 --> 39:13.310
Who's he with?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.895
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say a yoga instructor.

39:15.937 --> 39:19.482
No, wait.
Is that his teacher?

39:19.524 --> 39:21.359
This guy is unbelievable.

39:25.613 --> 39:29.326
Liam, this has to be way,
way on the down low.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.036
C.U. does not look
kindly on professors

39:31.077 --> 39:34.413
who consort with students,
even ex-students.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.874
My firm would not be
thrilled, either.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.543
Don't worry, Professor.
My lips are sealed.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.426
Honey, thank you!

39:47.468 --> 39:50.347
And call me when you get
back on your feet!

39:50.388 --> 39:52.557
(sighs)

39:52.598 --> 39:56.895
Recruiting Madison
was a real act of desperation.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.938
So fitting.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.108
I'm actually glad I did it.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.986
I've been unearthing all kinds
of interesting things, Alec.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.238
Great.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.031
Be sure to tell Max
how you got it.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.034
NAOMI:
Max!

40:11.076 --> 40:12.785
You're not gonna believe
what I found out.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.620
Come here.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.497
Max?

40:16.539 --> 40:18.917
We've been hacked.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.459
What?

40:20.501 --> 40:22.921
Look, we still don't know
the extent, but...

40:22.962 --> 40:25.090
someone who really knew
what the hell they were doing

40:25.131 --> 40:26.341
hacked into our secure server.

40:26.383 --> 40:30.011
That's where everything
was stored, Max. Everything!

40:30.053 --> 40:32.138
I...

40:32.180 --> 40:34.266
This could sink us.

40:34.307 --> 40:37.352
How the hell could something
like this happen?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.690
I am so sorry.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.734
That was just psycho.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.236
I feel bad for the guy.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.737
After what
he said to you?

40:47.779 --> 40:49.197
It's not about what he said.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.949
He's clearly got
a thing for you.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.658
Maybe, but...

40:52.700 --> 40:54.160
Look, cut him
some slack, okay?

40:54.202 --> 40:55.578
You're pretty irresistible.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.205
And with all
he's got going on.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.124
I mean, you and I
can never imagine

40:59.165 --> 41:00.333
the obstacles
these guys face.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.627
You are such a nice guy, Colin.

41:02.668 --> 41:06.214
(cell phone ringtone plays)

41:06.256 --> 41:09.675
Annie, I'm so sorry.
Uh, business emergency.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.552
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.179
Don't worry about it.
My friends are here.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.223
Great. You're the best.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.403
Have you seen the specs?

41:28.445 --> 41:31.530
We got everything we need
to get out in front of them.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.741
I hacked into the wife's
mobile phone.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.079
Candy from a baby.
