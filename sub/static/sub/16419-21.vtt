00:25.367 --> 00:28.199
Twerk it!
Twerk it!

00:28.200 --> 00:31.932
Put it down, flip it,
and reverse it!

00:31.933 --> 00:33.366
- Uh, I'm starting to get tired!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.566
- Yeah... can we quit dancin'
before we have heart attacks?

00:35.567 --> 00:40.033
- I just need about five
more seconds at full tempo.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.899
- Go guys! Come on,
just five more seconds!

00:47.900 --> 00:48.767
Go! Dance!

00:48.768 --> 00:51.300
Come on!
Go go go go!

00:57.500 --> 01:00.766
Oh, now that was fun to watch.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.066
You guys want some water?

01:02.067 --> 01:03.766
- Oh yeah. Yes please.
- Uh-huh.

01:03.767 --> 01:06.832
- Oof!
- Ah!

01:06.833 --> 01:08.066
- So? How great
is our new game?!?

01:08.067 --> 01:10.966
- It's good, it's fun,
but I think I'm gonna die.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.499
- Nice game,
good times, can't breathe.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.866
- Yeah, I think the people
from Games In Motion

01:13.867 --> 01:15.799
are gonna love it.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.133
- All right guys...
that's enough water.

01:21.933 --> 01:24.766
- Why would you take away

01:24.767 --> 01:27.066
our sweet, wet water?

01:27.067 --> 01:29.066
- Because
the Games In Motion people

01:29.067 --> 01:30.299
are gonna be here any minute.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.966
You guys gotta go get dressed.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.166
- We are dressed.

01:33.167 --> 01:35.666
- Yeah, why can't we just
wear what we're wearing?

01:35.667 --> 01:40.132
- Because.
You're sweaty and stinky.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.766
- Wait, which one am I?

01:41.767 --> 01:44.866
- Both.
You're both both.

01:46.767 --> 01:49.899
- Ohh! Ahhh!

01:49.900 --> 01:51.866
- We got a problem!

01:51.867 --> 01:54.866
- Hey! Dad!
What happened, what's wrong?!?

01:54.867 --> 01:56.832
- Ahhhh...

01:56.833 --> 01:59.066
Gone...

01:59.067 --> 02:01.632
Oh, Sebastian is gone...

He's gone.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.433
Gone too sooooon!

02:11.933 --> 02:13.799

02:13.800 --> 02:16.066
- My dad's pig.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.799
- Wait, his pig?

02:20.833 --> 02:23.332
- This is him.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.066
- Awwwwwwww.
- Ohhhh, so cute.

02:25.067 --> 02:28.066
- That's a hot pig.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.832
- I loved him so much.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.932
He was like a son to me...

02:32.933 --> 02:35.067
like the son I never had.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.233
Awwwwwww whyyyyy?!?

02:44.733 --> 02:46.266
- Hey Dub...
- What?

02:46.267 --> 02:49.632
- I can tell you
loved Sebastian a lot.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.366
- I did.

02:51.367 --> 02:53.567
- Well, then can I suggest
that we have a barbecue?

02:57.300 --> 02:59.066
'Cuz... what better way
to honor Sebastian...

02:59.067 --> 03:00.567
Than by eating him?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.432
- Okay, I just need you
to walk over there.

03:05.433 --> 03:07.333
- And do what?
- Doesn't matter.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.732
- Listen Dub,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.166
we all feel terrible that
your pig passed away...

03:14.167 --> 03:16.399
but you kinda have to go.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.499
- Dude...
he's really upset.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.899
- I know, but the people
from Games In Motion

03:19.900 --> 03:22.066
are gonna be here any minute.

03:22.067 --> 03:25.066
- Yeah Dub, you gotta go.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.866
- I don't wanna.
I don't wanna!

03:27.867 --> 03:29.166
- Hey, you guys, help us!

03:29.167 --> 03:30.766
- Step aside!

03:30.767 --> 03:32.467
- We got this.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.832
Let's go Dub!

03:35.833 --> 03:39.767
- Ahhhh!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

03:44.333 --> 03:46.566
- Ya gotta admit...
sometimes it's pretty great

03:46.567 --> 03:50.132
to have Bunny
and Ruthless around.

03:50.133 --> 03:52.333
- They took our couch.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.067
- Woo!
- Yeah!

03:58.068 --> 04:01.066
- Come on, start off
with a good one!

04:05.300 --> 04:08.667
- Go Babe!
- Woo!

04:12.067 --> 04:13.467

04:15.067 --> 04:17.832
- Woo!

04:17.833 --> 04:19.932

04:19.933 --> 04:22.099

we made for you!

04:22.100 --> 04:23.932
- Yeah, what'd you guys think?

04:23.933 --> 04:26.432
- Young lady...

04:26.433 --> 04:30.132
you realize that our company,
Games In Motion,

04:30.133 --> 04:31.067
is the third biggest
mobile game company,

04:31.068 --> 04:34.666
East of the Mississippi?

04:34.667 --> 04:36.132
- Y-yes sir.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.433
- So, we ain't easily impressed.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.633
- But danged if ya didn't do it!

04:44.500 --> 04:45.067
- Hi-yo!

04:45.068 --> 04:47.432
Honey, I swear,

04:47.433 --> 04:49.966
that's gotta be the best
dancin' game we ever saw.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.832
- Oh! So, you love it?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.566
- Shoosh yeah.

04:53.567 --> 04:56.367
It's more fun than a hot
pickle in a bucket of spit.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.532
- Well, um, we're thrilled

05:06.533 --> 05:08.132
that you guys are so
pumped about the game.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.567
- Yeah!
When are ya gonna pay us?!?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.599
- Trip.
- Geez dude.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.066
- Ah now, that's all right.
That's all right.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.632
- Our assistant Lou Anne

05:17.633 --> 05:20.199
she'll write y'all a check
for the full amount.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.466
- Great, that'd be perfect.

05:21.467 --> 05:24.667
- The full amount.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.066
- Now, this game y'all made
for our company...

05:35.067 --> 05:37.466
whaddaya call it?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.632
- Oh, well we haven't
picked a title yet.

05:39.633 --> 05:42.066
- Well, I don't care
what we call it

05:42.067 --> 05:43.732
as long as it has
the most dances

05:43.733 --> 05:45.053
that any mobile game
has ever had.

05:50.967 --> 05:54.932
- Okay, well the game's got
fifty different dances, so...

05:54.933 --> 05:59.199
- So, is that the most dances
that any dance game's ever had?

05:59.200 --> 06:01.466
- Umm... no.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.566
That would be "Dancetopia"
with sixty dances.

06:03.567 --> 06:06.332
- Ho ho ho hold up,
hold up there.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.499
- So you're sayin'
that there's another game

06:07.500 --> 06:11.199
has ten more dances than
the one y'all made for us?

06:11.200 --> 06:15.066
- Well, I mean...

06:15.067 --> 06:18.533
if you believe in math,
then yeah.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.066
- Heyyy, where's Lou Anne
with the check?

06:22.067 --> 06:24.466
- Aww, naw naw naw...

06:24.467 --> 06:26.566
- I think you Game Shakers

06:26.567 --> 06:28.087
are gonna need to add
some more dances.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.632
- Well, uh, gentlemen...

06:33.633 --> 06:34.732
you never told us
that our dance game

06:34.733 --> 06:37.699
had to have the most dances
of any game ever.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.967
- Oh, well...
now we told ya.

06:46.833 --> 06:50.599
- Okay, well how many dances
do you want in the game?

06:50.600 --> 06:53.332
- Well, if we gotta beat sixty,
then let's say...

06:53.333 --> 06:54.632
Seventy.
- Eighty.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.932
- I mean seventy is better.
- I know better than...

06:57.933 --> 06:58.966
- Hey hey!

06:58.967 --> 07:01.833
What do you say we
make it an even hundred?

07:02.133 --> 07:06.532
- That's a great idea!

07:06.533 --> 07:08.199
I like this stupid kid.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.732
- Uh... um...

07:10.733 --> 07:13.532
Well, I guess we could
do a hundred dances.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.399
- But... we're gonna need
two more weeks to finish it.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.766
- Ah, naw naw.
- No ma'am.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.399
- See, we've already announced
that we're releasin'

07:19.400 --> 07:21.132
this game in three days.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.366
- And we can't change that.

07:23.367 --> 07:25.166
- Well, how are we supposed
to add fifty more dances

07:25.167 --> 07:27.266
in three days?

07:27.267 --> 07:28.067
- That's not possible.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.599
- Y'know...

07:30.600 --> 07:34.899
Folks keep telling us
things ain't possible...

07:34.900 --> 07:37.833
'til we show 'em the case.

07:46.467 --> 07:50.332
- Whoooaaaa, look at that.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.700
- It's... it's so beautiful.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.332
- So... y'all think you can add

07:56.333 --> 07:58.266
fifty more dances to the game
by Sunday?

07:58.267 --> 08:02.299
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Oh yeah, yes we can.

08:04.933 --> 08:08.166
- Oh uh, sorry about that.

08:08.167 --> 08:11.067

there's no way we can add
fifty more dances to our game

08:52.167 --> 08:54.099
in less than three days.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.199
- Hey...

08:56.200 --> 08:58.232
You're being negative.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.166
That's not cool.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.699
- Can I have my french fry back?
- Will you be positive?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.600
- Yes.
- Then you may open your mouth.

09:06.333 --> 09:09.266
- Now, Kenz...
go...

09:09.267 --> 09:10.932
- Okay...

09:10.933 --> 09:13.932
We have 61 hours
to add 50 dances to the game.

09:13.933 --> 09:16.532
- Challenging but do-able.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.799
- Now...
If we take 61 hours...

09:18.800 --> 09:21.099
then subtract 15 hours
for sleeping...

09:21.100 --> 09:22.499
90 minutes for eating...

09:22.500 --> 09:24.266
and one hour for bathrooming...

09:24.267 --> 09:27.232
- That's bathroom as a verb...

09:27.233 --> 09:29.399
that leaves 43.5 hours

09:29.400 --> 09:32.499
for the four of us
to add 50 dances to the game!

09:32.500 --> 09:33.566
I'm tellin' ya!

09:33.567 --> 09:35.199
That's not possible!

09:35.200 --> 09:36.733
Ya don't have enough time!

09:38.233 --> 09:40.699
- I'm sorry, what?

09:40.700 --> 09:43.600
- Ach. The haggis is
in the fire for sure.

09:46.267 --> 09:49.599
- Okay, so are we
really gonna go for this?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.732
- Yes!
There's four of us.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.166
If each one of us
learns about twelve dances,

09:53.167 --> 09:54.232
that'll get us to fifty.

09:54.233 --> 09:56.566
- Okay people!

09:56.567 --> 09:58.066
Let's hurry back
to Game Shakers and get started!

09:58.067 --> 10:00.067
- All right!
- All right, let's move, guys!

10:02.800 --> 10:03.767
- Ma'am?

10:03.768 --> 10:06.567
May I please see a dessert menu?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.066

10:11.067 --> 10:11.833
- Come on!
- What, no...

10:11.834 --> 10:13.566
- No ordering that pudding.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.366

pudding, you get strong.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.733
- Come on Huds.
- Come on!

10:24.067 --> 10:25.566

10:32.700 --> 10:33.533

10:33.534 --> 10:36.299

11:55.967 --> 11:59.399
- Stanky a-chickens.
Stanky a-chickens.

12:05.300 --> 12:09.766
- Uh, what's going on?

12:09.767 --> 12:10.932
- Babe sent me a text

12:10.933 --> 12:12.899
sayin' she wanted us
to bring your couch back.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.432
- And Dub didn't wanna
get off of it...

12:15.433 --> 12:16.599
on account of his depression!

12:16.600 --> 12:19.167
- Ahhhh!

12:20.633 --> 12:22.566
- Awww... poor Dub.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.333
You still missin' your dead pig?

12:23.334 --> 12:26.432
- Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

12:26.433 --> 12:29.366
- Uh, actually Dub...

12:29.367 --> 12:30.333
I'm glad you're here.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.633
Go get it.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.699
Now...

12:36.700 --> 12:38.666
here, just let me
put this on you...

12:38.667 --> 12:40.832
- Ah, what are you doin'?
I can't see.

12:40.833 --> 12:43.099
- I know.
We have a surprise for you.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.667
- Oh, I can feel my tears.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.066
Oh!

12:50.067 --> 12:51.167
- Shh!

12:54.067 --> 12:56.632
Okay Dub...
here comes your surprise.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.267
- It better not be a new pig.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.132
- Wait... what'd you say?

13:04.133 --> 13:07.932
- Once when I was little,
my cat died...

13:07.933 --> 13:10.566
my mom and dad "surprised" me
with a new baby kitten.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.399
- Well, that sounds nice.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.666
- Pish!!!

13:14.667 --> 13:15.799
- I hated that new baby kitty,

13:15.800 --> 13:20.766
for tryin' to replace
my beloved Meow Meow.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.167
I hated my parents
for two years after that!

13:29.900 --> 13:31.900
Hey, so what's this surprise
you all wanna give me?

13:38.900 --> 13:40.300
- Uhhh...
we got you... this!

13:44.300 --> 13:44.800
- A sandwich?

13:44.801 --> 13:48.200
- Surprise.

13:50.867 --> 13:53.399
- That's a Cuban sandwich.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.699
- A Cuban sandwich?

13:54.700 --> 13:56.066
What type of meat is on there?

13:56.067 --> 13:58.666
- Oh, a Cuban sandwich is
made up of ham, pork, pickles...

13:58.667 --> 14:00.532
- Wh... ham and pork?!?

14:00.533 --> 14:03.667
- Yeah... the same stuff your
dead pig Sebastian was made of.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.699
- Double G!
Please don't eat me!

14:09.700 --> 14:11.432
I love youuuu!

14:11.433 --> 14:15.532
- BAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

14:15.533 --> 14:17.267
- Wait Dad, don't go!

14:20.600 --> 14:22.400
- Wow.
Dub must hate Cuba.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.933
- Hey, I'll eat
this Cuban sandwich!

14:30.400 --> 14:31.832
What?

14:31.833 --> 14:33.967
I never really cared
about that pig.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.899
- We'll see you guys tomorrow
at Sebastian's funeral.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.799
Wait...
We can't go to a funeral!

14:40.800 --> 14:43.066
We have dances to dance.

14:43.067 --> 14:46.633
Hey, c'mon... Dub's our friend,
and he's really upset.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.799
- Hey Bunny...

14:49.800 --> 14:50.533
you think if we all show
up at Sebastian's funeral,

14:50.534 --> 14:52.432
that'll cheer my dad up?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.099
- Nope!

14:55.100 --> 14:56.332
The only thing that'll
cheer Dub up

14:56.333 --> 15:00.899
is if somebody brings
a dead pig back to life!

15:00.900 --> 15:03.399
- True...
- Yeah...

15:03.400 --> 15:04.566
- Now hang on

15:04.567 --> 15:05.467
while I take another bite
of this Cuban sandwich.

15:05.468 --> 15:08.632
Mmmmmm.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.666
- Hey, hey...
I'll be back in five minutes.

15:10.667 --> 15:14.232
- Where are you going?
- To call Bobby Dong.

15:14.233 --> 15:17.566
- Dude. Bobby Dong can't
bring an animal back to life!

15:17.567 --> 15:18.966
- I know, but...
- Hey!

15:18.967 --> 15:21.333
Time for another bite!

15:47.067 --> 15:50.066
- Hey, I gotta talk to you.
- Yeah? What's up?

15:50.067 --> 15:51.632
- Do you realize
it's five-o-clock?

15:51.633 --> 15:53.332
- So?

15:53.333 --> 15:55.299
- So we were already
at the church for two hours.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.732
And now we've been standing
around here for 45 minutes!

15:57.733 --> 15:59.332
- Well whaddaya want me to do?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.366
I don't know how to
speed up a pig funeral.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.066
- We're way behind schedule
on our dances!

16:04.067 --> 16:05.299
- So we'll catch up tonight.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.067
- But we're running out of time!

16:08.833 --> 16:10.766
- Chickee-boo...

16:10.767 --> 16:12.066
- Oh hey, Bobby Dong.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.866
- Hm. It is done.

16:14.867 --> 16:15.733
You take this.

16:15.734 --> 16:19.499
- Oh this is it?
Cool.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.067
Hey lemme check
this out for a sec...

16:26.900 --> 16:29.132
Oh yeah, yeah.

16:29.133 --> 16:32.267
My dad is gonna love this...

16:34.867 --> 16:37.732
Bobby?
Bobby?

16:37.733 --> 16:40.732
- Attention...

16:40.733 --> 16:41.866
- B-Bobby?

16:41.867 --> 16:43.732
Attention, please...

16:43.733 --> 16:46.067
Everybody take your seats.

16:51.733 --> 16:54.132
Thank you.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.866
Most of you know...

16:55.867 --> 16:56.767
that I was a good friend
of Sebastian...

16:56.768 --> 16:58.932
our beloved pig...

16:58.933 --> 17:00.799
- Oh God, this is
gonna take forever.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.732
- Shhhhh!

17:03.733 --> 17:05.432
- And now, at this time,

17:05.433 --> 17:08.132
I'd like to call up
Sebastian's best friend

17:08.133 --> 17:09.832
in the whole world.

17:09.833 --> 17:13.632
My boss,
and my friend... Double G.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.199
- Ah. Okay.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.132
- C'mon y'all!
Make some noise for him!

17:19.133 --> 17:21.799
Double G in the spot!
Woooooo!!!

17:21.800 --> 17:23.799
- Hey...
hey... Ruthless!

17:23.800 --> 17:25.099
- What?!?
- This is a funeral.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.799
You don't ask people to
"make some noise" at a funeral.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.699
- Oh.
Sorry everybody!

17:31.700 --> 17:34.932
You all did the right thing!
By not makin' some noise!

17:34.933 --> 17:37.533
Imma go sit down now!

17:40.067 --> 17:43.132
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon!

17:43.133 --> 17:47.366
I've been tryin' to come up
with the right words, ya know?

17:47.367 --> 17:52.132
To express how I feel
about Sebastian.

17:52.133 --> 17:55.266
And then I realized...

17:55.267 --> 18:00.299
the rap musical genius
that I am...

18:00.300 --> 18:04.199
I need to write words...
And poems...

18:04.200 --> 18:06.066
That inspire emotion.

18:06.067 --> 18:10.232
So, to express how I feel
about Sebastian...

18:10.233 --> 18:14.966
I decided to write
this long poem.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.532
- Well, that's it.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.066
We're never gonna
make that deadline.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.799
- Okay.
We're gonna make it.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.532
Just whip out your laptop.
- Why?

18:22.533 --> 18:24.466
- So you can record
my dance moves.

18:24.467 --> 18:26.132
- You can't dance at a funeral!

18:26.133 --> 18:28.366
- Why not?
- 'Cuz it's disrespectful!

18:28.367 --> 18:29.932
- Well the pigs not gonna know.
He's already dead.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.067
Now hurry!

18:35.867 --> 18:40.067
- Sebastian!
Sebastian!

18:40.933 --> 18:42.800
I remember you,
in my swimmin' pool...

18:45.233 --> 18:48.966
when you were splashin'.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.266
Splashin' Sebastian

18:51.267 --> 18:52.466
- Okay, I'm synced up.

18:52.467 --> 18:55.299
Ready to record
The Nutty Fudger.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.832
Please forgive me for tarnishing

18:56.833 --> 18:58.799
a pig's final moments on Earth.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.799
- Just start the music.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.132
- What! What!

19:06.133 --> 19:08.066
What are you doing?!

19:08.067 --> 19:11.799
Um....The Nutty Fudger?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.599
- Fudge... What? Hey!

19:13.600 --> 19:15.299
Why are you dancing
with those balls?

19:15.300 --> 19:19.200
- Just keep reading,
it's a beautiful poem.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.266
- I remember that time
Ruthless got hungry,

19:26.267 --> 19:28.499
and wanted you as a snack.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.666
But I scared him off real good,
cuz I got your piggy back.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.400
- Dance faster.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.399
- She's disrespectin'
my pig's funeral!

19:45.400 --> 19:47.166
Stop dancing along with her!

19:47.167 --> 19:49.533
- Hard not to.
Her moves are turnt.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.466
- I'm sorry, Dub.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.700
I wanna stop, but my
body won't say no!

19:56.233 --> 19:57.899
- You all are heartless!
Heartless!

19:57.900 --> 20:00.932
You'll never understand the love
between a man and his pig.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.832
I mean Sebastian's gone...

20:03.833 --> 20:05.899
Gone forever.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.100
And I'm never gonna
see him again.

20:23.067 --> 20:24.199
- Sebastian!

20:24.200 --> 20:26.433
- What the pork!?

20:27.567 --> 20:29.299
- He's a zombie pig!

20:29.300 --> 20:30.999
He's come back
to get revenge on all of you

20:31.000 --> 20:32.633
for disrespectin' his funeral!

20:34.433 --> 20:37.066
- Dad, he's not a zombie pig.

20:37.067 --> 20:40.032
I had Bobby Dong
turn Sebastian into a drone.

20:40.033 --> 20:43.432
- You mean to tell me you
stuffed my dead pig

20:43.433 --> 20:47.432
and turned him into some
type of flyin' swine?

20:47.433 --> 20:49.999
- Uh... kinda.
- Why'd you do that?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.566
- So you wouldn't
have to say goodbye...

20:53.567 --> 20:55.032
I mean, you've been
so upset since Sebastian died.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.567
And now, you can play
with him forever.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.732
- That's messed up.

21:02.733 --> 21:04.966
- No it's not.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.266
It's beautiful.

21:06.267 --> 21:08.132
I love you, Trip.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.766
- I love you too, Dad.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.199
You know, tomorrow
I was thinking we could...

21:12.200 --> 21:13.667
- Shut up and gimme that remote!

21:19.167 --> 21:21.266
Ha ha! Sebastian!

21:21.267 --> 21:24.732
He's alive!

21:24.733 --> 21:27.066
How do I make it
attack Babe and Kenzie?

21:27.067 --> 21:30.932
- Here, I'll show you.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.932
- Yeah! Go piggy piggy!

21:32.933 --> 21:34.767
- Uh, Babe...
Incoming pig!

21:35.967 --> 21:38.832
- Go get her, Sebastian!

21:38.833 --> 21:43.132
Nobody dances at your funeral.

21:43.133 --> 21:44.566
Hey, that thing
got missiles on it?

21:44.567 --> 21:46.833
- Not yet,
but I'll call Bobby Dong.

21:49.067 --> 21:54.066
- This is the best
Bar-Mitzvah ever.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.533
Crank that music!

22:03.100 --> 22:05.566
Mmm.
