No, apparently,
both Aaron and Luca

19:34.170 --> 19:36.960
have real feelings
for me.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.120
Well, that's, like,
a good thing, though, right?

19:40.120 --> 19:43.290
No. Because now I have to
choose between both of them.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.290
I don't really
get you, Zoey.

19:47.290 --> 19:48.750
I mean, were you
planning on just

19:48.750 --> 19:50.420
tossing your line out
into the water

19:50.420 --> 19:53.210
and hoping that just one of 'em
wasn't gonna bite?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
Maybe.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.000
Is that so awful?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.960
So, then, you were wanting
one of these guys

19:59.960 --> 20:03.830
to basically make
your decision for you.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.250
Girl!

20:05.250 --> 20:07.380
But you can't fall into
a relationship with someone

20:07.380 --> 20:08.580
by default.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.750
That's the thing.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.670
Nomi, I have real feelings
for both of them.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.170
Okay, so, then,
stop playing games

20:15.170 --> 20:17.830
and take control.

20:17.830 --> 20:20.420
It's time to make
a grown-up decision,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.790
even if that means
losing one of them.

20:30.710 --> 20:33.710
Zoey: It was time for me
to grow up and make a decision,

20:33.710 --> 20:36.380
but that could wait
'til the morning.

20:36.380 --> 20:39.420
My head was spinning, and
I just needed to sleep on it,

20:39.420 --> 20:43.880
and maybe tomorrow things would
feel a lot less complicated.
