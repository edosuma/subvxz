WEBVTT

00:00.344 --> 00:02.021
Last season on "Batwoman"...

00:02.024 --> 00:03.982
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:03.984 --> 00:06.401
Kate, don't leave me! Don't leave me.

00:06.403 --> 00:08.507
I want her very, very dead!

00:08.509 --> 00:09.922
If you want Kate dead so badly,

00:09.924 --> 00:11.234
why don't you just shoot her?

00:11.236 --> 00:13.296
No. Her betrayal deserves a reckoning!

00:13.298 --> 00:14.399
Where did you get that?

00:14.401 --> 00:15.782
A friend gave it to me for safekeeping

00:15.784 --> 00:17.618
in case she ever lost her way.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.593
Oh, goody. It's Tommy Elliot.

00:19.595 --> 00:21.001
What about me?

00:21.003 --> 00:23.581
I'm the guy that taught Bruce
Wayne everything he knows,

00:23.583 --> 00:25.294
so where's my recognition, Doc?

00:25.296 --> 00:26.631
I must admit, Tommy.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.690
I made all your dreams come true.

00:28.692 --> 00:30.361
You made me Bruce Wayne.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.698
I need you to strut through
the doors of Wayne Tower

00:32.700 --> 00:34.374
and get me that shard of Kryptonite

00:34.376 --> 00:37.244
from your dear cousin Kate.

00:57.295 --> 00:59.162
I think you'll like it here.

00:59.164 --> 01:01.231
There's plenty of room for your stuff,

01:01.233 --> 01:04.132
and your plants will
have their own balcony.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.919
Yes, I said balcony, and look!

01:06.921 --> 01:09.774
Only two locks. We are a
two-lock household now, Mom.

01:09.776 --> 01:11.173
Ooh. Aren't we fancy?

01:11.175 --> 01:12.376
And your little girlfriends will have

01:12.378 --> 01:14.179
an easier time sneaking in and out now.

01:14.181 --> 01:15.649
Okay. Can we not? You are my mama.

01:15.651 --> 01:17.251
You're not supposed to
know about that stuff.

01:17.253 --> 01:18.599
Rent's due on the first.

01:18.601 --> 01:22.284
My office is next to the laundry.

01:22.286 --> 01:24.720
- Are you ready for our new life?
- Mm-hmm.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.730
I did not just see that!

01:43.898 --> 01:45.407
Holy...

01:45.409 --> 01:47.277
Okay. This is freaky.

01:47.279 --> 01:49.423
Apparently Gotham's raining jet parts.

01:49.425 --> 01:51.216
- Already on it.
- Is Kate there?

01:51.218 --> 01:52.635
She hasn't checked in since she landed

01:52.637 --> 01:54.287
in National City yesterday.

01:54.289 --> 01:56.256
Batcave to Batwoman. You online?

01:56.258 --> 02:00.762
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello?

02:00.764 --> 02:03.565
Hello?

02:03.567 --> 02:06.503
Can anybody moan or something?

02:15.107 --> 02:18.343
Oh. Ohh!

02:27.892 --> 02:29.292
The suit's GPS is off.

02:29.294 --> 02:30.861
So is her phone.

02:30.863 --> 02:33.355
What about calling her
old-school, Bat-Signal?

02:33.357 --> 02:35.124
Can we flip it on remotely?

02:35.126 --> 02:36.617
We could till the Crows

02:36.619 --> 02:38.639
pulled it offline in their
war with Batwoman.

02:38.641 --> 02:41.296
Now anyone who touches
the thing loses a hand.

02:41.298 --> 02:43.833
- Want to try the hold-up?
- Already calling.

02:47.994 --> 02:49.695
Wake up!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.668
Come on. Live!

02:53.670 --> 02:55.277
Live!

02:56.480 --> 02:59.548
Come on! Wake up! Live, please!

02:59.550 --> 03:00.783
Come on!

03:03.888 --> 03:05.589
Why isn't she answering?

03:05.591 --> 03:07.125
Maybe she's already at the scene.

03:07.127 --> 03:08.188
With her comms off?

03:08.190 --> 03:11.891
You sure she flew in from
National City this morning?

03:11.893 --> 03:13.526
Checking.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.895
Hey, hey.

03:15.897 --> 03:17.731
You're gonna be okay, okay?

03:17.733 --> 03:19.499
You're gonna be okay.

03:28.777 --> 03:31.644
Wayne Enterprises tail number GC9K23

03:31.646 --> 03:35.081
was set to depart at 10 A.M.
from National City.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.451
Delayed for weather.

03:36.453 --> 03:37.752
So maybe she's still in Nat. City.

03:37.754 --> 03:39.503
Tail number GC9K23

03:39.505 --> 03:42.059
actual departure time...

03:42.061 --> 03:43.951
9:35 P.M.

03:43.953 --> 03:45.752
So she's en route.

03:45.754 --> 03:48.889
Explains why she hasn't
gotten any of our calls.

03:48.891 --> 03:51.793
Except she was set to
land 20 minutes ago.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.774
Hello?

04:07.776 --> 04:10.243
Okay. GC9K23 departed at 9:35 P.M.

04:10.245 --> 04:12.779
At 10:15, 10,000 feet, 400 knots.

04:12.781 --> 04:16.116
At 10:45, 450 knots, 8,500 feet.

04:16.118 --> 04:18.819
At 10:50...

04:18.821 --> 04:21.255
What?

04:21.257 --> 04:23.191
10:50 what?

04:24.760 --> 04:26.594
What, Luke?

04:28.731 --> 04:31.231
Luke?

04:31.233 --> 04:33.534
Where is Kate's plane?

04:49.184 --> 04:51.185
Oh, my God.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.041
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

05:23.686 --> 05:26.453
Why don't you guys start there?

05:26.455 --> 05:28.472
Okay. Kane's here. Uh, listen.

05:28.474 --> 05:32.125
Go now that way and
check in with me later.

05:32.127 --> 05:33.204
What have you found?

05:33.206 --> 05:35.230
Sir, I don't think you should be
anywhere around here right now.

05:35.232 --> 05:36.966
This was my daughter's airplane.

05:36.968 --> 05:39.024
Tell me what you have.
Have you recovered anyone?

05:39.026 --> 05:42.122
Not yet, but trust me, Kane, go home.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.303
We'll call you if we find anything.

05:43.305 --> 05:45.447
I am not leaving here
without my daughter.

05:45.449 --> 05:47.708
Sir.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.610
We'll look together.

05:52.748 --> 05:54.382
Come on.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.921
You two, with me.

06:08.397 --> 06:10.997
What do you mean Julia
couldn't find the Batsuit?

06:10.999 --> 06:13.224
Julia said she was one of the
first to arrive at the crash site,

06:13.226 --> 06:14.227
searched everywhere,

06:14.229 --> 06:15.856
meaning if Kate was wearing
it she could've survived.

06:15.858 --> 06:17.425
No, but Kate would
have called us, though.

06:17.427 --> 06:18.594
Not if she's unconscious,

06:18.596 --> 06:20.030
so when the suit wakes
up, we'll find her.

06:20.032 --> 06:21.366
I get that it's a supersuit,

06:21.368 --> 06:23.460
but 10,000 feet is still
a hell of a freefall.

06:23.462 --> 06:25.116
Yeah, but the cape's nanotech
is more advanced

06:25.118 --> 06:26.203
than a NASA parachute,

06:26.205 --> 06:29.454
and the suit's shock-absorbing
properties are unlike anything...

06:29.456 --> 06:31.356
No way.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.926
- Bruce.
- I came as soon as I heard.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.296
It's been 4 years, Bruce.
Where have you been?

06:42.298 --> 06:44.533
If only the answer was as simple
as the question, Mini Fox.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.935
Complicated's fine. We're smart.

06:46.937 --> 06:48.769
I know. Let's find Kate,

06:48.771 --> 06:50.679
and then I'll tell you 3 all about it.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.442
It's my dad.

06:52.444 --> 06:54.918
I should check in, but I
really don't want to leave.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.453
No. He needs you, Mary.

06:56.455 --> 06:59.322
You should go. We'll stay in touch.

06:59.324 --> 07:01.859
If anyone can help us, it's you.

07:05.464 --> 07:06.831
Barely changed the place.

07:06.833 --> 07:11.434
Heh. Uh, you should
probably see the Batcave.

07:11.436 --> 07:14.237
Yeah, I probably should.

07:14.239 --> 07:15.840
Want the honors?

07:17.509 --> 07:20.210
Not sure we have time
for a Proust read-along.

07:20.212 --> 07:23.013
Hilarious. You can go right ahead.

07:26.451 --> 07:28.985
You okay?

07:28.987 --> 07:34.357
Ahem. You've been the man of
the castle for sometime now.

07:34.359 --> 07:36.126
Lead on.

07:36.128 --> 07:38.562
Oh. Okay.

07:45.704 --> 07:47.905
Just like old times, right?

07:56.548 --> 07:59.149
So, Ryan. What's new?

07:59.151 --> 08:01.818
Anything I should I know about?

08:01.820 --> 08:04.053
Actually, um,

08:04.055 --> 08:07.857
I stumbled on something pretty sick,

08:07.859 --> 08:09.559
kind of a game changer.

08:09.561 --> 08:10.960
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

08:10.962 --> 08:13.062
Was it housing?

08:13.064 --> 08:16.199
No. Um, it was not housing.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.535
Okay. What about employment?

08:18.537 --> 08:20.670
All those years teaching martial arts,

08:20.672 --> 08:23.840
surely there's a dojo
that will hire you.

08:23.842 --> 08:25.375
Still looking.

08:25.377 --> 08:28.442
Tell me you paid your court fines.

08:28.444 --> 08:31.280
You make it sound like
these are all my choices.

08:31.282 --> 08:34.448
They are your choices, Ryan.

08:34.451 --> 08:38.352
You have the power to turn this around.

08:38.355 --> 08:41.356
You want to know why
I haven't paid my fines?

08:41.357 --> 08:43.357
Because I can't find a job

08:43.360 --> 08:45.085
because I don't have a home

08:45.087 --> 08:47.674
because no landlord wants
to rent to an ex-con

08:47.676 --> 08:49.031
on post-release.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.499
You see how this works?

08:50.501 --> 08:52.367
No one cares that the dope wasn't mine

08:52.369 --> 08:53.945
or... or that the Crows were dirty

08:53.947 --> 08:56.972
or that I'm actually a decent human.

08:56.974 --> 09:00.208
I am a file in your cabinet.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.920
That is not having power.

09:01.922 --> 09:05.748
That is the very definition
of powerless.

09:14.089 --> 09:17.091
Mind if I join you?

09:17.093 --> 09:20.028
I'd prefer it.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.397
Any news?

09:22.399 --> 09:23.833
Nothing.

09:25.736 --> 09:28.704
- How you holding up?
- I'm not.

09:28.706 --> 09:32.040
The basement vending machine can attest.

09:34.044 --> 09:36.311
We're not finding her alive, are we?

09:36.313 --> 09:37.846
Oh, I'm not giving up yet.

09:37.848 --> 09:39.714
Investigators said the plane was flying

09:39.716 --> 09:41.516
with a recalled engine part.

09:41.518 --> 09:44.052
I heard the same thing.

09:44.054 --> 09:47.090
Do you believe that?

09:47.092 --> 09:49.900
Clear skies, the pilot's
psych eval checks out.

09:49.902 --> 09:52.080
Because a few days ago,

09:52.082 --> 09:53.780
you showed me photographs of us

09:53.782 --> 09:56.865
being tailed by some mysterious
woman named Safiyah.

09:56.867 --> 10:00.369
You two had drama, and I
ended up in her crosshairs.

10:00.371 --> 10:01.371
What are you saying?

10:01.373 --> 10:04.406
I'm saying you and Kate were close, too.

10:04.408 --> 10:08.610
Who's to say she didn't have
the same photographs of her?

10:08.612 --> 10:11.013
Julia, if you know something

10:11.015 --> 10:12.216
about Kate's plane being targeted...

10:12.218 --> 10:14.019
I know what you know.

10:14.021 --> 10:17.089
But, sir, we've barely
started our search.

10:17.091 --> 10:19.731
I can send more men.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.481
This is my daughter, Commissioner.

10:22.483 --> 10:24.618
I am not giving up.

10:35.606 --> 10:37.205
That sounded awful.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.708
They I.D.ed the pilot.

10:39.710 --> 10:42.411
His hand washed up in the harbor.

10:42.413 --> 10:43.980
They think Kate's in the river.

10:43.982 --> 10:46.803
But they're guessing. They
don't... know anything.

10:46.805 --> 10:49.421
They've shifted the search
from rescue to recovery.

10:49.423 --> 10:52.546
Who? The same people who convinced you

10:52.548 --> 10:54.923
to stop looking for Beth
when she went missing?

10:54.925 --> 10:57.961
Dad, we can't listen to them.

10:57.963 --> 11:01.832
How is this happening all over again?

11:01.834 --> 11:03.268
Hey.

11:10.174 --> 11:12.316
You and I, we both know

11:12.318 --> 11:15.110
that crazier things have happened.

11:15.112 --> 11:16.778
I'm not gonna lose hope,

11:16.780 --> 11:19.782
and I'm not gonna let
you lose it either.

11:26.356 --> 11:29.024
Okay. For the record,
Kate found it all on her own,

11:29.026 --> 11:30.325
and Batwoman was her idea.

11:30.327 --> 11:31.818
Well, Kate's not the type to sit idle

11:31.820 --> 11:35.130
while her sister's upending Gotham.

11:35.132 --> 11:38.201
Wait. Hold up. You know Alice is Beth?

11:39.515 --> 11:44.339
Of course. They are my cousins.

11:44.341 --> 11:45.908
Red accents are a choice.

11:45.910 --> 11:47.679
Bruce, come on.

11:47.681 --> 11:49.916
Why didn't you call or... or write

11:49.918 --> 11:51.829
or answer one of my 3,000 texts?

11:51.831 --> 11:53.899
Because for every Alice
Kate had, I had 20,

11:53.901 --> 11:55.601
all trying to find a way to kill me

11:55.603 --> 11:57.069
and everyone I cared about.

11:57.071 --> 11:59.439
Protecting you meant not letting you in.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.869
Sticky bomb launcher.

12:05.871 --> 12:09.181
Ohh.

12:09.183 --> 12:11.450
Oh. Your old man knew what he was doing,

12:11.452 --> 12:13.053
although I would have preferred

12:13.055 --> 12:14.631
the suit stay fully impenetrable.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.468
Trust me. That makes two of us.

12:18.759 --> 12:23.262
In fact, this is why Kate
flew to National City,

12:23.264 --> 12:25.365
to ask Kara Danvers if we could destroy

12:25.367 --> 12:26.653
one stupid piece of Kryptonite

12:26.655 --> 12:28.835
before it got into the wrong hands.

12:35.576 --> 12:37.509
The only material on earth strong enough

12:37.511 --> 12:40.946
to penetrate the Batsuit.

12:40.948 --> 12:42.315
I should probably hold onto this.

12:42.317 --> 12:43.457
Look. I wanted it gone, okay?

12:43.459 --> 12:45.578
I... I... I thought I could protect her.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.114
Hey, hey, hey.

12:48.510 --> 12:51.145
We'll find her, okay?

12:56.825 --> 12:58.593
Wait. Where's the suit?

13:07.544 --> 13:09.078
Never again.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.815
- Unh!
- Ugh!

13:16.317 --> 13:17.917
Huh!

13:45.213 --> 13:47.118
Time to be powerful.

13:59.265 --> 14:01.300
Hey! Show yourself!

14:03.002 --> 14:04.635
Boo!

14:04.637 --> 14:06.371
Unh!

14:08.041 --> 14:09.974
I did not think that through.

14:11.511 --> 14:14.012
Whoo-hoo!

14:23.723 --> 14:25.289
Hoo hoo! Ha ha!

14:25.291 --> 14:28.459
I'm bulletproof, bitches!

14:28.461 --> 14:30.062
Wait. What the?

14:36.236 --> 14:38.069
Kate.

14:38.071 --> 14:41.506
Ha ha! What is this, some wannabe?

14:41.508 --> 14:43.574
Agh! Agh! Ohh!

14:43.576 --> 14:45.904
Sorry. Legit didn't mean that.

14:45.906 --> 14:48.579
Sorry? You freaking shot me!

14:48.581 --> 14:51.015
Look. I'm looking for someone.

14:51.017 --> 14:54.051
Figure the False Face
Society knows things.

14:54.053 --> 14:57.089
So who's gonna point me
in the right direction?

15:10.837 --> 15:13.771
I have no idea what this button does.

15:13.773 --> 15:16.040
You want to figure it out together,

15:16.042 --> 15:17.409
or you want to help?

15:36.356 --> 15:38.189
Blech.

15:41.595 --> 15:45.363
_

15:45.365 --> 15:47.966
Not for long.

15:47.968 --> 15:50.135
I got to hand it to you, Tommy.

15:50.137 --> 15:51.770
What the hell are you doing here?

15:51.772 --> 15:56.341
I gave you the face,
but you nailed the voice,

15:56.343 --> 15:59.978
and now Gotham's most
eligible bachelor's

15:59.980 --> 16:01.904
playing find the tan lines

16:01.906 --> 16:06.785
while I... flail... aimlessly.

16:06.787 --> 16:10.089
Can't say I didn't hold up
my end of the deal, hmm?

16:11.928 --> 16:14.763
The only thing stronger
than the Batsuit,

16:14.765 --> 16:18.133
which Mini Fox is in the
process of retrieving,

16:18.135 --> 16:21.669
and very soon, the world
will call me Batman.

16:21.671 --> 16:25.607
Oh. Do you want a parade?

16:25.609 --> 16:27.798
Because I'm pretty sure my sister

16:27.800 --> 16:30.212
is in the large intestine
of a great white.

16:30.214 --> 16:32.681
Oh, is that what this is?

16:32.683 --> 16:34.149
Are you in mourning?

16:34.151 --> 16:35.351
You wanted her dead.

16:35.353 --> 16:37.421
Wanted to kill her myself!

16:37.423 --> 16:39.704
Not to say, "I told you so",

16:39.706 --> 16:42.740
to a... belligerent psychopath.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.984
You could have shot her months ago

16:44.986 --> 16:46.353
when she was out of the suit.

16:46.355 --> 16:51.226
Heh heh. When did I say
I was going to shoot her?

16:51.228 --> 16:55.031
I said I wanted her dead.

16:55.033 --> 17:00.658
Ehh. You..."Cousin Bruce"...
procured the Kryptonite.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.996
I was going to ensure
Commander Kane found it.

17:04.998 --> 17:07.108
A scene would bring them together.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.901
Batty would get caught
in his crosshairs.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.929
Then bang! As she went down,

17:12.931 --> 17:14.768
he would pull off her cowl,

17:14.770 --> 17:17.138
to discover in sinking horror

17:17.141 --> 17:20.612
that he had killed his own daughter.

17:22.648 --> 17:26.173
Alas... mechanical failure.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.108
Hey, Bruce. There's no steam

17:28.111 --> 17:30.045
coming out of the steam shower.

17:33.947 --> 17:35.614
What the hell did you do that for?

17:35.616 --> 17:38.786
No reason at all because
reason doesn't matter.

17:38.788 --> 17:40.122
She's got a friend upstairs.

17:40.124 --> 17:41.224
You want her to call the cops?

17:41.226 --> 17:44.468
I tried being reasonable once.

17:44.470 --> 17:47.772
I... was tethered to reason.

17:47.774 --> 17:52.468
I was calculated, precise, planned,

17:52.470 --> 17:54.679
and look where that got me.

17:54.681 --> 17:56.781
Sharing a roof with Bruce lame.

17:56.783 --> 18:00.141
On what planet do I agree
to live with a woman

18:00.143 --> 18:03.222
who just told me her plan
to have her father kill her twin

18:03.224 --> 18:04.724
like it was some kind
of April Fool's joke.

18:04.726 --> 18:06.657
On my planet

18:06.659 --> 18:11.610
because on my planet
you are still Tommy Elliot,

18:11.612 --> 18:14.092
and if I so much as breathe a word,

18:14.094 --> 18:16.434
Bruce Wayne goes from being the meat

18:16.436 --> 18:17.969
in a top model sandwich

18:17.971 --> 18:20.739
to the guy with a steak for a face!

18:22.742 --> 18:25.009
Trust me, Tom-Tom.

18:25.011 --> 18:28.246
An Alice with a goal is so much sweeter

18:28.248 --> 18:30.415
than an Alice unmoored.

19:07.393 --> 19:10.762
Fancy seeing you here.

19:10.764 --> 19:12.215
Figured I'd look around to see

19:12.217 --> 19:13.899
if Kate had been getting
any death threats.

19:13.901 --> 19:15.936
And what did we deduce from that jumper?

19:15.938 --> 19:17.805
Is it dangerous?

19:19.999 --> 19:21.532
What are you doing here?

19:21.534 --> 19:23.142
Before she left, Kate said that

19:23.144 --> 19:24.471
if anything ever happened to her

19:24.473 --> 19:25.803
that I should check her safe.

19:25.805 --> 19:28.640
Okay. Where is it?

19:28.642 --> 19:31.704
She also asked that I not tell anyone.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.140
Pretty sure she didn't mean me.

19:33.142 --> 19:36.244
Why? Some sort of unrequited
soul mate clause?

19:37.917 --> 19:40.584
Because I think Kate has been
targeted for some reason,

19:40.586 --> 19:44.356
and she knows I won't stop
until I find the truth.

19:58.972 --> 20:03.140
Uh, GPS says it's this way.

20:07.513 --> 20:09.981
Kate? Kate!

20:09.983 --> 20:11.483
You're alive!

20:14.988 --> 20:17.488
No.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.156
Guess you're in on it, too.

20:19.158 --> 20:21.759
I saw her plane go down,
put two and two together.

20:21.761 --> 20:24.128
I'm really sorry.

20:25.531 --> 20:27.829
Well, the suit has GPS,

20:27.831 --> 20:30.969
so you might as well just
give it back now, Miss...

20:36.309 --> 20:40.678
Wilder, Ryan, and I'm
not done with it yet.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.781
That suit is meant for a hero,

20:42.783 --> 20:44.148
not the lost and found.

20:44.150 --> 20:45.683
You tell that to the bored billionaire

20:45.685 --> 20:47.286
who found it in Batman's lost box?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.088
You don't know the first
thing about Kate Kane,

20:49.090 --> 20:51.722
and you sure as hell don't know
anything about that symbol.

20:51.724 --> 20:53.991
Trust me, I know I'm not a symbol

20:53.993 --> 20:55.893
or a name or a legacy.

20:55.895 --> 20:58.396
Exactly, so why do you think
you're worthy of wearing it?

20:58.398 --> 21:00.197
Because I'm a number.

21:00.199 --> 21:04.185
I am the 327th baby of a black woman

21:04.187 --> 21:06.504
who died during childbirth that year.

21:06.506 --> 21:09.874
I'm a $20 a day check to a group home.

21:09.876 --> 21:12.559
I'm inmate 4075, serving 18 months

21:12.561 --> 21:15.379
for a crime I didn't commit,

21:15.381 --> 21:16.961
but I can live with all those numbers

21:16.963 --> 21:19.016
because the mama who adopted me,

21:19.018 --> 21:21.252
I was her number one,

21:21.254 --> 21:23.700
but it turns out she's just one

21:23.702 --> 21:25.970
of a quarter million
murders in this country

21:25.972 --> 21:28.092
who have not seen justice,

21:28.094 --> 21:31.896
and that is a number I can't live with,

21:31.898 --> 21:33.697
so you can have this damn suit back

21:33.699 --> 21:35.599
when her killer is dead.

21:35.601 --> 21:37.135
Uh...

21:49.453 --> 21:52.220
Ha!

21:52.222 --> 21:53.955
Bruce Wayne.

21:53.957 --> 21:56.558
I take it they're out
of cocaine in Belize.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.126
Missed you, too, Uncle Jake.

21:58.128 --> 21:59.228
You know, believe it or not,

21:59.230 --> 22:01.162
I came home to help
find my favorite cousin.

22:01.164 --> 22:02.303
You want to help?

22:02.305 --> 22:04.136
You stay out of my way
and let me do my job.

22:04.138 --> 22:06.390
That's why I'm here...
to eliminate distractions.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.671
I have a lead on Gotham's
most elusive terrorist.

22:09.673 --> 22:11.840
Batwoman? I scared her away.

22:11.842 --> 22:13.676
I'm referring to Alice.

22:13.678 --> 22:15.610
How? You just got home.

22:15.612 --> 22:17.846
Exactly. She's squatting in my house.

22:17.848 --> 22:20.048
She must have figured
I was gone for good.

22:20.050 --> 22:21.583
Now look. Before you barge in there

22:21.585 --> 22:23.318
and start mucking up all my furniture,

22:23.320 --> 22:26.321
I'd prefer not to end
up on her kill list.

22:26.323 --> 22:28.224
You didn't hear this from me.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.933
Bruce?

22:38.935 --> 22:41.603
- Oh!
- Julia Pennyworth.

22:41.605 --> 22:43.638
Oh! Luke told me you were back.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.340
Yeah. I meant to call, but, um...

22:45.342 --> 22:47.302
No. We've all been so worried about you.

22:47.304 --> 22:49.777
I'm here, I'm healthy,

22:49.779 --> 22:51.880
and I'm late for a
meeting actually, so...

22:51.882 --> 22:53.716
did you ring The Eagle?

22:53.718 --> 22:55.403
Eagle?

22:55.405 --> 22:58.907
The Eagle. Daddy practically raised you.

22:58.909 --> 23:00.822
I think he thinks you're dead.

23:00.824 --> 23:04.025
Good point. Um, yeah,
I'll clear that up.

23:04.027 --> 23:05.727
Well, he's at home in Glasgow,

23:05.729 --> 23:07.362
same little cottage in the woods.

23:07.364 --> 23:08.865
I'll buzz him ASAP.

23:08.867 --> 23:10.634
Good seeing you, Jules.

23:12.969 --> 23:14.769
Look, Mary, there's no point.

23:14.771 --> 23:16.505
Okay. She figured out
how to turn off the GPS.

23:16.507 --> 23:20.008
I know, but if I learn more
about this Ryan Wilder chick,

23:20.010 --> 23:22.710
maybe I can narrow down her circles

23:22.712 --> 23:24.614
and figure out where she lives.

23:24.616 --> 23:27.216
"The Kane family has
turned their 56th-floor

23:27.218 --> 23:30.586
riverside penthouse into a
search party headquarters".

23:30.588 --> 23:33.307
Hmm. That would be nice. 56 floors up.

23:33.309 --> 23:36.357
Talk about optimal sunlight.

23:36.359 --> 23:37.692
Don't look at me like that.

23:37.694 --> 23:39.694
Her mom died in childbirth,

23:39.696 --> 23:41.930
father died before she was born.

23:41.932 --> 23:43.731
"Following her father's footsteps,

23:43.733 --> 23:46.100
Kate attended Point Rock Academy".

23:46.102 --> 23:48.102
In and out of group homes,

23:48.104 --> 23:51.172
teen runaway, high-school dropout.

23:51.174 --> 23:53.642
Oh. Wait a minute. This is juicy.

23:53.644 --> 23:57.080
"Kate was dishonorably discharged
weeks before graduation.

23:57.082 --> 23:58.547
In her statement, Kate said,

23:58.549 --> 24:00.105
'It's paradoxical to fight on behalf

24:00.107 --> 24:02.650
of an institution that sees...

24:02.652 --> 24:06.854
my sexual orientation as the enemy.'"

24:06.856 --> 24:09.457
Okay. That's kind of badass.

24:09.459 --> 24:13.294
Arrested for possession and intent.

24:13.296 --> 24:16.598
Insisted the drugs weren't hers

24:16.600 --> 24:18.504
and served 18 months.

24:18.506 --> 24:20.979
"Under Pride Real Estate,
she donated millions

24:20.981 --> 24:23.204
to inner city housing projects.

24:23.206 --> 24:25.406
Most recently, she opened The Hold-Up,

24:25.408 --> 24:27.777
a gay bar that she called a safe haven

24:27.779 --> 24:29.544
for anyone looking for their family".

24:29.546 --> 24:31.381
At her sentencing, the judge said that

24:31.383 --> 24:32.815
Ryan had been on the right track

24:32.817 --> 24:34.818
thanks to the woman who adopted her.

24:34.820 --> 24:38.037
Ryan graduated high
school, she found a job.

24:38.039 --> 24:40.655
Everything fell apart after.

24:40.657 --> 24:42.056
Oh, my God.

24:43.628 --> 24:46.254
Apparently when Ryan and
her adoptive mom walked

24:46.256 --> 24:48.129
into their new apartment,

24:48.131 --> 24:50.598
they startled a bunch of squatters,

24:50.600 --> 24:52.567
and a fight broke out.

24:52.569 --> 24:53.901
The building's landlord

24:53.903 --> 24:56.171
and Ryan's mom were killed.

24:58.341 --> 24:59.841
What the hell is this?

24:59.843 --> 25:01.776
Who are these people?

25:01.778 --> 25:03.712
I don't know. They just showed up.

25:03.714 --> 25:05.849
We need to get out of here now!

25:07.917 --> 25:09.417
The squatters were linked

25:09.419 --> 25:12.021
to the Alice in Wonderland gang.

25:17.994 --> 25:21.162
That's why she wants the suit,

25:21.164 --> 25:24.032
to go after Alice

25:24.034 --> 25:26.602
because Alice's gang killed her mom.

25:26.604 --> 25:30.838
3, 4, 5, 6! Come on, Mommy! Live!

25:30.840 --> 25:33.207
Wake up! Please!

25:34.844 --> 25:37.546
Wake up, please, Mama!

25:42.952 --> 25:46.087
Kate's a hero...

25:46.089 --> 25:48.456
in the suit...

25:51.227 --> 25:54.495
I'm sorry, Mama.

25:54.497 --> 25:56.598
and out of the suit.

26:12.182 --> 26:14.649
They're right, Mama.

26:14.651 --> 26:16.719
What am I doing wearing
the suit of a hero

26:16.721 --> 26:18.953
when I couldn't even save you?

26:18.955 --> 26:21.222
I mean, I get it.

26:21.224 --> 26:24.193
Her mom died in her arms.

26:26.101 --> 26:28.135
She wants justice.

26:31.735 --> 26:34.369
Hey.

26:34.371 --> 26:35.770
We're gonna find Kate.

26:35.772 --> 26:39.273
She needed the suit to survive.

26:39.275 --> 26:41.376
Miracles happen. I mean...

26:41.378 --> 26:42.910
It's my fault.

26:42.912 --> 26:46.681
I was the one hell-bent on
destroying the Kryptonite.

26:46.683 --> 26:49.283
She didn't even want
to do it, and I pushed.

26:49.285 --> 26:51.462
Luke, that is not what happened.

26:51.464 --> 26:53.588
I'm the reason she got on that plane.

26:53.590 --> 26:56.491
Kate's dead...

26:56.493 --> 26:57.960
because of me.

27:00.530 --> 27:01.997
Luke.

27:04.267 --> 27:08.737
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

27:11.274 --> 27:12.808
Yeah.

27:17.914 --> 27:19.648
Look at me.

27:22.089 --> 27:24.224
What would Kate say if she knew

27:24.226 --> 27:25.820
you were blaming yourself?

27:25.822 --> 27:29.323
I don't know. Things
are usually her fault.

27:29.325 --> 27:34.529
She'd tell you that there'd be
no Batwoman without Luke Fox

27:34.531 --> 27:39.500
and to put your pain into
something worth changing.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.558
Come get your suit back.

28:05.061 --> 28:07.129
He didn't remember our
codename for my father.

28:07.131 --> 28:08.998
The Eagle? He made it up.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.501
Yes. I told him to ring Daddy at home

28:10.503 --> 28:12.003
at his cottage in Glasgow.

28:12.005 --> 28:13.239
Bruce didn't blink an eye.

28:13.241 --> 28:15.108
Alfred lives in a flat in London.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.578
I smelled alcohol on his breath.

28:16.580 --> 28:18.347
I saw he had a drink in
the commander's office,

28:18.349 --> 28:19.583
ran the glass for prints.

28:19.585 --> 28:21.920
Please do not say what I
think you're about to say.

28:21.922 --> 28:23.923
I'm really sorry, Luke.

28:23.925 --> 28:25.925
_

28:26.760 --> 28:29.027
I think Alice made him a new face.

28:29.029 --> 28:33.314
No. No. They carried Tommy Elliot
out of Arkham in a body bag.

28:33.316 --> 28:35.567
Or they wanted us to believe as much,

28:35.569 --> 28:37.485
and who better to masquerade
as Bruce Wayne

28:37.487 --> 28:40.556
than the person who's been
obsessed with him his entire life?

28:40.558 --> 28:43.093
_

28:47.096 --> 28:49.664
How did I not see this?

28:49.666 --> 28:52.067
Bruce is my friend, and Tommy...

28:52.069 --> 28:54.104
Tommy Elliot killed my dad!

28:54.106 --> 28:56.470
Luke, you wanted Kate back,

28:56.472 --> 28:58.305
and if the miracle arrival
of Bruce Wayne

28:58.307 --> 29:01.677
could help find her,
then why question it?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.809
I showed him the Batcave.

29:08.221 --> 29:10.189
Where is it, Brucey boy?

29:18.814 --> 29:20.915
I know it's here somewhere.

29:29.259 --> 29:30.626
There she is.

30:01.771 --> 30:04.806
- He's going after Ryan.
- Ryan? Why?

30:04.808 --> 30:06.643
For the suit

30:06.645 --> 30:08.479
so he can be Batman.

30:43.376 --> 30:45.043
I know what a watermelon looks like

30:45.045 --> 30:46.846
when it falls from a great height.

30:46.848 --> 30:48.619
That's your sister you're talking about.

30:48.621 --> 30:50.817
And now she's gone,

30:50.819 --> 30:53.454
which is probably your cue
to move on with your life,

30:53.456 --> 30:57.458
maybe remarry, find a new
daughter to replace her with.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.690
I'm not making the same
mistakes I made with you.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.960
I will not stop looking
until she's found.

31:01.962 --> 31:03.463
It's over, Alice...

31:03.465 --> 31:05.666
Kate Kane is Batwoman!

31:09.068 --> 31:11.635
And I'm the Joker. Arkham's waiting.

31:11.637 --> 31:15.406
Use your brain, Commander.

31:15.408 --> 31:17.574
A lesbian superhero

31:17.576 --> 31:21.512
who could have killed me
a dozen times but didn't?

31:21.514 --> 31:25.816
Hmm. I wonder who that could be.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.285
That's preposterous.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.621
Kate would have told me.

31:29.623 --> 31:31.491
You rejected her

31:31.493 --> 31:36.583
over and over to the world, to her face.

31:36.585 --> 31:40.488
Hee hee! You wanted her dead.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.935
- You're wrong.
- Am I,

31:44.937 --> 31:50.344
or did you spend your last
precious moments together

31:50.346 --> 31:53.677
firing a gun at her?

31:53.679 --> 31:56.581
You got your wish, Daddy.

31:56.583 --> 32:01.285
Batwoman is dead,

32:01.287 --> 32:04.723
and she died knowing
that her father hated her.

If you don't believe me,
turn on the Bat-Signal,

32:14.233 --> 32:16.334
see if she comes.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.711
Uh, Batcave to R-Ryan.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.234
Is Batman actually chasing me right now?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.327
It's not Batman. It's Tommy Elliot.

32:56.329 --> 32:57.330
He looks like Bruce Wayne,

32:57.332 --> 32:58.805
but he's actually a psychotic
Arkham escapee

32:58.807 --> 33:00.144
who will kill anyone in his path.

Are you kidding me? What was that?

33:24.071 --> 33:25.505
He wants the suit.

33:25.507 --> 33:27.407
He can have it. I'll
toss it out the window!

33:27.409 --> 33:28.743
- No!
- No! If he gets that suit,

33:28.745 --> 33:30.446
he becomes the most
dangerous person in Gotham.

33:30.448 --> 33:31.948
- You need to outrun him.
- Outrun him?

33:31.950 --> 33:35.299
Look at his car. I don't
even have hubcaps!

33:42.276 --> 33:44.577
Here's a sentence
I've never said before.

33:44.579 --> 33:46.190
Can you hack the Batmobile?

33:46.192 --> 33:47.826
I'll try. Until 10 minutes ago,

33:47.828 --> 33:49.495
I didn't even know it was in here.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.972
I'm in.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.284
Come on!

34:17.380 --> 34:19.114
Well, that bought her some time.

Tommy from getting the suit.

36:28.416 --> 36:30.168
Hey. We're just lucky
we got the Batmobile back

36:30.170 --> 36:31.237
before the cops showed up.

36:31.239 --> 36:34.475
My point is we may
have been a little judgy

36:34.477 --> 36:35.944
when we first met her.

36:35.946 --> 36:37.634
She did a good job filling in today.

36:37.636 --> 36:39.550
Kate is Batwoman, Mary.

36:39.552 --> 36:42.120
I know. Uh...

36:46.990 --> 36:48.957
It's not bulletproof, FYI.

36:55.702 --> 36:58.502
Is this from the Kryptonite?

36:58.504 --> 37:02.006

37:10.184 --> 37:12.583

37:22.900 --> 37:25.268
What... what about your mom?

37:25.270 --> 37:29.826
That suit, it's bigger than me.

37:29.828 --> 37:31.429
It's one thing to put it on,

37:31.431 --> 37:33.665
and it's another thing to wear it.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.602
Like you said, Kate was a hero.

37:35.604 --> 37:37.204
I'm not.

37:50.690 --> 37:53.858
Are you still in love with Kate?

37:53.860 --> 37:57.094
Where did that come from?

37:57.096 --> 37:59.063
Because I know how you used to feel,

37:59.065 --> 38:00.533
that if you could do it all over again

38:00.535 --> 38:02.900
you would have jumped on her bike
and left Point Rock in your dust.

38:02.902 --> 38:05.736
How do you even know that?

38:05.738 --> 38:07.690
The question is...

38:07.692 --> 38:12.143
did you still feel that
way two days ago?

38:12.145 --> 38:14.146
I don't know.

38:17.450 --> 38:20.017
This is what Kate left in her safe.

38:20.019 --> 38:22.420

tell you this in person.

38:57.323 --> 38:59.657
I'm Batwoman.

38:59.659 --> 39:02.493
Though part of me thinks you always knew

39:02.495 --> 39:07.099
even when I did a damn good
job of convincing you otherwise,

39:07.101 --> 39:09.360
I'm telling you this because I know

39:09.362 --> 39:11.134
you'll figure it out eventually,

39:11.136 --> 39:13.404
and I want you to know that lying to you

39:13.406 --> 39:15.673
was the hardest thing I've ever done,

39:15.675 --> 39:21.078
but I lied because I love you,

39:21.080 --> 39:23.081
because I wanted to protect you,

39:23.083 --> 39:26.784
and because I was scared
that you would push me away,

39:26.786 --> 39:28.319
so that's the truth.

39:28.321 --> 39:31.489

a good job for our city,

40:22.875 --> 40:26.076

40:26.078 --> 40:29.580

40:29.582 --> 40:32.416
and now there's no Batwoman to stop it.
