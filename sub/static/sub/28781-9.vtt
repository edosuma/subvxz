WEBVTT

00:02.120 --> 00:04.030
<i>Wegthor, and the
home of our resistance.</i>

00:04.200 --> 00:05.910
<i>Why does Zod have
such a chub for this moon?</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:07.270
Wegthor's a mining colony

00:07.480 --> 00:09.110
<i>home to a compound
known as Stellarium.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.350
<i>Zod is processing it to fuel
the interstellar fleet.</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:15.710
<i>It is time for Krypton
to take its rightful place</i>

00:15.880 --> 00:17.590
<i>in the universe as conquerors.</i>

00:17.760 --> 00:21.670
The colonization of
alien planets is our future,

00:21.840 --> 00:24.030
<i>Doomsday is our path
toward it.</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:25.630
<i>Amidst my travels
in the future</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:27.470
<i>I encountered the Black Mercy.</i>

00:27.640 --> 00:29.390
<i>Administering
Black Mercy toxin.</i>

00:29.560 --> 00:31.270
- The toxin's working.
- Mother, stop!

00:31.440 --> 00:32.310
Please don't do this!

00:32.479 --> 00:33.590
You're gonna have
to make a choice.

00:35.120 --> 00:35.830
Kem.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.220
Tagging along on another
mission, huh, buddy?

00:37.400 --> 00:39.670
- <i>I'm leading the mission.</i>
- Well done, Commander.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.670
- <i>Lyta-Zod died on Wegthor.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

00:43.840 --> 00:45.310
I'm sorry, Mother,
but you left me no choice.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.660
<i>I crafted her replacement</i>

00:46.840 --> 00:48.060
from a Somatically
Reconditioned clone.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.100
- Mother?
- Lyta?

00:52.320 --> 00:53.070
<i>The real Lyta.</i>

00:53.280 --> 00:54.950
Oh, I'm never letting go
of you again.

00:55.320 --> 00:55.950
Good.

00:56.120 --> 00:56.950
We're moving up the launch

00:57.160 --> 00:58.630
and ending
this resistance now.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.670
When this is over, there will
not be a soul left on Wegthor.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.230
Why would he do this?

02:26.080 --> 02:29.590
He couldn't have me
openly challenge his authority.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.110
He created a mother
who was more receptive

02:34.680 --> 02:36.630
to his ideology.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.950
He said he was doing it
out of love,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.030
for the person
he knew I could be.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.710
If this is what he does
to those he loves,

02:44.880 --> 02:46.200
I can only imagine
what he has planned

02:46.360 --> 02:47.310
for the rest of the galaxy.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.510
There's no need.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.630
I know exactly
what he intends to do:

02:52.480 --> 02:56.590
use Doomsday to destroy
any alien civilization

02:56.760 --> 02:58.350
that refuses his rule.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.990
And once he takes Wegthor and
gets the Stellarium he needs,

03:02.200 --> 03:04.390
nothing will be able
to stand in his way.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.830
We have to get to Wegthor--
warn my grandfather that--

03:07.040 --> 03:08.150
That's not possible.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.550
The space elevator base
has been destroyed

03:10.720 --> 03:13.470
and all communication
with Wegthor is down.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.310
There's no way to reach him.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.750
Actually, there might be.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.180
A smuggler on Wegthor
who Kem introduced me to

03:20.360 --> 03:23.670
modified a skimmer
for short-range space travel.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.110
I took it when I deserted.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.230
It's a death trap, but if
the Sagitari haven't found it,

03:28.400 --> 03:29.350
it might still be there.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.950
Well, it's worth a shot.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.590
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.830
You'll be safer here.
You're in no shape--

03:38.000 --> 03:39.710
- You need--
- He's right.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.590
You'll be of no use to him
up there.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.670
There'll be
other battles, Lyta,

03:43.840 --> 03:46.350
and we'll need you
at full strength to fight them.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.710
I'll go.
I know the tunnels.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.150
You'll never be able to find
the Stronghold without me.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.550
<i>All right.</i>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.280
<i>Let's just hope we can get
there before Dru's warships.</i>

03:57.560 --> 04:00.950
<i>The attack on our fleet
has been thwarted.</i>

04:01.120 --> 04:04.710
The Rebels had hoped
to stall our mission--

04:04.880 --> 04:07.630
to sow confusion and dissent--

04:07.800 --> 04:09.390
but they have failed.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.350
All their treachery has done
is strengthen our resolve

04:14.560 --> 04:16.870
and seal their fate.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.430
The war on Wegthor

04:19.600 --> 04:21.430
ends today.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.270
Soon, we will have control

04:25.440 --> 04:26.660
of the Stellarium.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.790
Soon, we will fulfill
our destiny.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.630
And soon, the entire galaxy

04:32.800 --> 04:35.670
will learn to fear us.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.960
We launch today.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.310
For Krypton!

04:41.480 --> 04:43.190
For Krypton!

05:09.960 --> 05:10.830
What's wrong?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.430
While you were under
the control of the Black Mercy,

05:16.600 --> 05:18.950
did it really give you
the life of your dreams?

05:25.160 --> 05:26.710
It must have been hard
to give that up.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.430
It was.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.750
But it gave me clarity

05:32.280 --> 05:34.310
about what I truly want.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.230
What was that?

05:37.840 --> 05:38.870
You.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.960
It showed me what's
possible between us...

05:46.320 --> 05:49.030
and it is a life and a love...

05:49.240 --> 05:51.150
worth fighting for.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.670
Seg, are you ready?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.870
- I'll just wait outside, yeah?
- Nyssa, wait.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.030
Seg told me
what happened to Jor.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.830
I'm so sorry.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.390
I'll do everything I can
to bring him back.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.430
Thank you.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.470
How you holding up?

06:30.040 --> 06:31.070
Fine.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.190
No, you're not.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.430
You've barely said a word
since we got back here.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.710
I'm sorry.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.190
I'm happy for you, Seg.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.470
I am.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.110
You and Lyta
get another chance.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.030
It's a miracle.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.710
I didn't believe in them
till now.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.870
Me neither.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.950
She's the love of your life,
isn't she?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.270
Why are you asking me this?

07:04.480 --> 07:05.470
Because I'm terrified

07:05.640 --> 07:07.590
that you might be
the love of mine.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.070
Don't say anything.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.230
It was selfish of me
to say it, but...

07:14.280 --> 07:15.710
seeing you and Lyta...

07:16.880 --> 07:17.950
old habits die hard.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.310
According to Dev, the skimmer
should be somewhere around...

07:40.080 --> 07:40.790
here.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.380
What are you doing?

07:48.880 --> 07:52.270
Either I'm hallucinating
or this skimmer is cloaked.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.790
We have a spaceship.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.630
A really,
really shitty spaceship.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.630
Please don't do this.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.390
There may not be enough
Black Mercy toxin in his system

08:10.560 --> 08:11.750
to keep him under control.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.990
Then I suggest you pray to
whatever gods you believe in.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.309
Kneel.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.070
How's she doing?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.270
Running a fever.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.510
That parasite must have left
some kind of residual virus

09:19.680 --> 09:20.630
in her system.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.310
Is it serious?

09:22.640 --> 09:24.190
I don't think
she's in any danger,

09:24.360 --> 09:26.710
but we need
to get her temperature down.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.150
The nearest med bay
is in Kandor

09:28.320 --> 09:30.310
and we're not exactly
welcome there.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.110
What about Hantha root?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.070
We used it on Wegthor
to fight infection

09:35.240 --> 09:37.430
when our medical supplies
went short.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.790
That could work.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.310
I'm pretty sure they have
a stash in the Public House.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.390
I'll see if I can find it.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.910
How can you look at me
like that after what I've done?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.910
- Lyta, we don't have to talk--
- I failed you.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.670
I dishonored myself
and our name.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.110
You did what you were taught.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.760
I raised you to be a warrior,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.310
ruthless and loyal
at any cost.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.670
No.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.230
I won't let you blame yourself.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.510
That day in the tunnels,

10:51.280 --> 10:53.070
I had a choice:

10:53.480 --> 10:55.470
his life or yours.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.190
I made the wrong one,

10:57.360 --> 10:59.590
and I have to live with that.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.150
What's done is done.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.270
We've both made mistakes,

11:05.440 --> 11:08.670
and fate has given us
a second chance.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.510
If we can bury
the past together,

11:11.680 --> 11:13.590
we can help rebuild Krypton

11:13.760 --> 11:17.350
and forge a new legacy
for House Zod.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.510
We can be remembered for more
than bloodshed and death.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.350
I'm sorry, Mother.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.900
Do you forgive me?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.150
There is nothing to forgive.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.190
You are my daughter.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.790
I love you.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.550
You are, and always will be,

11:48.720 --> 11:51.390
the best part of me.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.470
If we can establish
a new position

12:06.640 --> 12:08.230
on the other side
of the Leestan Crater,

12:08.600 --> 12:09.740
then we might have a chance
of offering

12:09.920 --> 12:11.550
some kind of resistance.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.470
Grandpa!

12:23.760 --> 12:25.910
I knew you'd find your way
back home.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.230
Well, we have Adam Strange
to thank for that.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.070
I've missed you, my boy.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.830
I'm sorry you had
to come back to this.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.350
There's so much
I need to tell you!

12:36.080 --> 12:37.830
So many things
you need to know.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.180
We don't have any time.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.950
Grandpa, Zod's fleet...

12:43.120 --> 12:43.950
it's on its way.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.910
Where did you get
this information?

12:48.840 --> 12:51.590
The last time we acted
on intel you provided,

12:51.760 --> 12:54.140
a lot of good men and women
lost their lives.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.590
Zod...

12:57.720 --> 12:59.070
he played me.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.030
Look, you don't have
to trust Nyssa.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.830
Trust me.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.110
Zod's fleet of warships
is coming,

13:05.280 --> 13:07.950
and, if we don't act now,
we're all dead.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.030
We'd already begun making
preparations for an attack,

13:12.200 --> 13:13.790
but, because of
the communications blackout,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.750
we had no idea
it would come this soon.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.660
We're still vulnerable.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.910
But now they've lost
the element of surprise.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.590
Gives us a tactical advantage.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.910
They won't expect us
to be ready.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.870
Take as many of our troops
as we can spare

13:28.080 --> 13:30.030
and fortify our trench
positions on the surface.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.880
I'll deal with securing
all points of entry.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.150
Dak, Ver, Kaz,

13:42.320 --> 13:44.110
you'll reinforce
our defensive positions

13:44.280 --> 13:46.270
in the upper tunnels
at Access Five and Six.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.470
The rest of you, same thing,
Access Two and Three.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.710
- Nobody gets in, you understand?
- Copy that.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.230
Force barriers
that Val ordered

13:54.400 --> 13:55.540
at the choke points are active.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.860
Had a team stay behind.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.110
Offer a second line of support
just in case they're breached.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.590
Well, look at you

14:01.760 --> 14:03.510
sounding like
a real soldier, huh?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.910
You know, I'd be into it
if it wasn't for all the rules

14:06.080 --> 14:06.950
and crappy food.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.550
- Long hours, killing.
- Killing.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.910
- Blood.
- Blood.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.220
Mostly the killing
and the blood.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.580
Yeah, well,
you can't really escape--

14:12.760 --> 14:14.630
Okay, ow, ow, ow.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.150
That really hurts.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.310
Surprise.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.750
Oh, by the light of Rao,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.590
it is good
to see your ugly face.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.150
- I missed you too, brother.
- Oh, man.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.310
Oh, let's bring it in.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.910
- Yep.
- Don't fight it.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.470
- We're in.
- This feels good, doesn't it?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.030
- Something's in.
- Three of us buddies just...

14:32.200 --> 14:34.550
getting close.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.780
- Yeah.
- A little too close.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.070
- Your hands were everywhere.
- Look at you.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.830
- Proper military man.
- Huh?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.190
I'm impressed.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.990
They even let me carry a gun
and order people about.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.350
It is crazy.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.870
You know what
my grandfather said?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.870
He said that you and Adam
have been invaluable

14:50.040 --> 14:50.870
to the Resistance.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.990
That's a true story.
You should have seen him.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.710
- Crushing ass.
- You've been crushing ass?

14:55.880 --> 14:58.030
- Well done.
- Val-El needs to see you all.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.590
He said it's urgent.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.350
Now what was it
you said to me

15:02.520 --> 15:03.510
after you killed me
in the Outlands?

15:03.680 --> 15:05.390
- Oh--
- Oh, yeah.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.120
- "Heroes don't take days off."
- That's right.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.110
Let's do it.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.030
Wait, when you said
"crushing ass," is--

15:11.200 --> 15:13.430
do you mean--wait.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.270
Adam?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.950
Why is there only one
of them?

15:43.160 --> 15:44.630
Because that's all he needs.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.150
One ship is big enough

15:46.320 --> 15:48.700
to fit five battalions
of Sagitari.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.230
Commander Lux, have we got
a visual on the craft?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.230
Affirmative.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.350
But it's too far away for our
artillery to be effective

15:59.560 --> 16:00.750
<i>against its shielding.</i>

16:00.920 --> 16:02.550
<i>We have to let them come
to us.</i>

16:03.160 --> 16:05.150
Is anyone else seeing
what I'm seeing?

16:06.920 --> 16:09.150
Some strange
thermal signature.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.070
- That doesn't make sense.
- <i>We have movement.</i>

16:14.760 --> 16:15.980
Look alive, people!

17:06.200 --> 17:06.829
What is it?

17:07.040 --> 17:09.069
<i>General,
Doomsday is in position.</i>

17:09.240 --> 17:10.589
<i>We await your orders.</i>

17:12.359 --> 17:13.680
Kill them all.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.020
Hold your fire.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.230
Wait until whatever
that thing is gets closer.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.910
Now give it all you've got!

17:53.080 --> 17:54.030
Fire!

18:15.640 --> 18:17.670
Hold fire!

18:21.640 --> 18:23.270
<i>Commander Lux, report!</i>

18:33.400 --> 18:34.390
I think we got him.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.950
We got him!

18:54.680 --> 18:56.710
<i>Commander Lux,
are you reading me?</i>

18:58.480 --> 18:59.620
<i>Commander?</i>

19:01.280 --> 19:02.950
What's happening out there?

19:04.360 --> 19:05.470
Commander Lux?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.550
<i>All troops retreat!</i>

19:16.320 --> 19:17.710
Hold your position, soldier.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.470
<i>Are you reading me?
Retreat!</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:21.590
Hold your positions, damn it!

19:22.960 --> 19:23.910
<i>All troo--</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:26.590
There will be
no falling back.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.310
No retreat.
We stay and fight!

19:30.280 --> 19:32.510
We cannot let that thing
get to our base!

19:32.720 --> 19:34.590
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.750
- I said, are we clear?
- Yes!

19:36.920 --> 19:40.030
Then follow me!

19:58.120 --> 19:59.070
Come on!

20:33.440 --> 20:34.550
They're gone.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.470
They're all gone.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.790
What was that?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.670
It's Doomsday.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.230
He's in the tunnels.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.790
If he reaches us,
then everything we lived

20:56.960 --> 20:58.910
and died for will be lost.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.590
The force barriers
are slowing him down

21:00.760 --> 21:02.150
but they can't
keep him out forever.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.580
There has to be something
we can do.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.670
- Maybe--
- There isn't.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.710
No matter how hard we fight
or where we hide,

21:06.880 --> 21:08.100
that thing will not stop
until it murders us

21:08.280 --> 21:09.750
and everyone on
this goddamn rock.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.350
I cannot accept that, Adam.
There has to be--

21:11.480 --> 21:13.390
You don't get it!
There is no other way!

21:13.560 --> 21:15.190
What part of
"unstoppable killing machine"

21:15.360 --> 21:16.430
do you not understand?

21:16.520 --> 21:18.110
The only one person

21:18.200 --> 21:20.580
who's ever stopped Doomsday
in the universe

21:20.760 --> 21:21.900
doesn't exist anymore.

21:22.080 --> 21:22.830
Well, great, Adam.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.030
What are we supposed
to do then?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.420
Just sit around and wait
for him to kill us?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.670
No!
We run like we stole something!

21:28.840 --> 21:30.030
That's what we do!

21:30.200 --> 21:31.270
And we live
to fight another day.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.630
We have to get off this moon.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.390
That is
a beautiful idea, Adam.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.470
But you forget
that the space elevator

21:36.640 --> 21:38.110
has had its ass crushed!

21:38.280 --> 21:39.750
And not all of us
have a Zeta-Beam.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.430
Maybe we don't need
a Zeta-Beam.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.550
There is a perfectly good ship
sitting up there on the surface

21:44.720 --> 21:45.990
and it is more than big enough

21:46.240 --> 21:47.590
to fit the rest
of our fighting force

21:47.760 --> 21:49.510
as well as every civilian
we can find on it.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.870
We'll never be able
to take it,

21:51.040 --> 21:52.510
and it's full of Sagitari.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.590
Is it?

21:53.920 --> 21:55.590
That heat signature
we saw earlier.

21:56.160 --> 21:56.830
It was very faint.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.950
Now, initially I thought that
maybe the sensors were being

21:59.120 --> 22:00.870
blocked by the armor.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.630
But if Doomsday really is
as unstoppable

22:03.840 --> 22:06.480
as Adam says he is,
then Zod wouldn't need

22:06.640 --> 22:08.350
to send more Sagitari.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.870
- Maybe a skeleton crew at best.
- And what if you're wrong?

22:12.040 --> 22:13.870
Well, then we're dead anyway.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.870
But at least this way
we have a chance.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.420
Listen, if this is gonna work,
we have to do it now.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.820
We need someone
to lead a strike team

22:20.000 --> 22:21.140
to take the ship.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.950
- God damn it, I'll--
- I'll do it.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.430
You can trust me, Val.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.950
All right.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.950
Adam, I need you to oversee
evacuation procedures.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.350
Get all of our troops
and every civilian available

22:35.520 --> 22:37.190
to the surface
and onto that ship.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.150
The three of us, we will try
to slow down this monster.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.870
Buy them some time.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.430
May Rao's light shine
on all of us.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.300
Right, let's get to it.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.390
you want to collapse the mines.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.550
All except the mine
in Access Three.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.390
Once you and Seg get there,
all you have to do

22:58.600 --> 23:01.670
is reposition the explosives
onto a vein of raw Stellarium.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.870
Once that's done,
you'll head for the surface.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.270
I'll detonate the bombs
remotely and meet you there.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.910
I think that sounds
incredibly dangerous.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.590
Why--why are we doing this?

23:10.760 --> 23:12.510
It is incredibly dangerous,
but the chain reaction

23:12.680 --> 23:14.510
should collapse
the entire tunnel system.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.100
Doomsday will be trapped,
and that will give us

23:17.280 --> 23:20.030
all the time we need
to get everyone onto that ship

23:20.560 --> 23:22.150
and off this moon.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.430
Right.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.350
This is where I leave you.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.710
Contact me
if there's any trouble.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.100
Oh, hey,
don't worry about us.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.110
- We'll be in and out in no time.
- Yeah.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.830
You just get everyone
on the ship, okay?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.190
Yeah.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.670
See you soon, my boy.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.950
Okay, Val.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.390
Your grandfather's insane.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.030
Are we--
are we really doing this?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.700
No, yeah.
Be just like old times, mate:

23:58.880 --> 24:00.310
you, me,

24:00.480 --> 24:01.830
ripping off knuckle-headed
labor guildsmen

24:02.040 --> 24:03.390
in the gaming pits
at the Rankless.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.790
It's nothing like that
at all.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.430
- No, no.
- Even a little bit.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.160
But hey, could be fun, maybe.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.750
You had me at "maybe."

24:13.120 --> 24:16.110
Come on, everyone, suit up.
We've got an ass to crush.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.750
Drink this.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.840
Make you feel better.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.030
That tastes awful.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.580
Like the inside
of a Rondor's ass.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.830
If I told you that before,
you wouldn't have taken it.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.510
And how do you know

25:03.680 --> 25:06.510
what the inside
of a Rondor's ass tastes like?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.350
I've been on many
exciting adventures

25:09.520 --> 25:10.870
since leaving the Sagitari.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.350
What was she like?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.710
My clone.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.910
What was she like?

25:40.960 --> 25:43.950
She was exactly the same
as you in every way.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.550
The same memories.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.350
The same light in her eyes
when she laughed.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.870
The only difference
was her unwavering allegiance

25:56.040 --> 25:56.870
to your son.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.670
There was one other thing.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.540
We became involved.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.110
You needed some--

26:13.040 --> 26:16.030
she needed someone
to fill the void Seg left

26:16.200 --> 26:19.150
after he disappeared,
and I was more than willing.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.390
Always thought we were destined
to be together, Lyta,

26:23.200 --> 26:26.230
that being with you would fill
the empty places inside me.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.310
Then it became a reality.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.910
I finally got what I wanted.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.750
Imagine my shock
when I realized

26:38.920 --> 26:40.350
the emptiness still remained.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.350
They found us.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.790
Let's check over here.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.910
Follow some movement.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.820
On your knees.
On your knees!

27:10.720 --> 27:12.190
Lose the helmets.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.870
Now, does anyone else know
you're here?

27:19.040 --> 27:21.030
We're not telling
you traitors shit.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.070
Then this will be
a very short conversation.

27:23.280 --> 27:23.950
Stop.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.070
How is this possible?

27:32.240 --> 27:35.390
- We saw you killed.
- General Zod deceived you.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.790
He created a clone,

27:37.960 --> 27:41.910
Somatically Reconditioned her,
and allowed her to be executed

27:42.080 --> 27:44.430
as a result
of his own treachery.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.870
If he isn't stopped,

27:48.040 --> 27:50.470
many more Kryptonians will die

27:50.640 --> 27:52.550
for his twisted vision--

27:52.720 --> 27:55.100
Kryptonians that you
as Sagitari

27:55.240 --> 27:57.470
swore an oath to protect.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.150
My son is a man with no honor.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.870
He is not worthy
of your loyalty.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.110
Why should we believe you?

28:06.280 --> 28:08.740
Sagitari Thur, isn't it?

28:10.440 --> 28:13.000
Your brother and I
were cadets together.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.870
He saved many lives
at the Battle of Muri,

28:16.040 --> 28:17.390
mine included.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.950
As Primus,
I made it my business

28:19.120 --> 28:20.790
to learn everything I could

28:20.960 --> 28:24.310
about the brave men
and women serving Krypton.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.430
Primus Zod.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.310
How may we serve?

28:38.520 --> 28:40.430
Now, listen very carefully...

28:40.600 --> 28:43.270
and do exactly as I say.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.080
We've lost signal.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.070
Try rerouting power
through auxiliary systems.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.270
The couplings
aren't responding.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.670
He must have damaged
the main grid.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.470
We're bleeding power!

28:58.600 --> 28:59.990
Seg!

29:00.160 --> 29:01.480
Seg, can you hear me?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.790
Seg, report!

29:05.960 --> 29:07.910
- Listen, you should go.
- Val--

29:08.080 --> 29:09.870
Just get out of here.
Be safe, please.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.270
I'm--I'm not leaving
without you.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.900
Just go.
I'll be following shortly.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.030
- Please.
- You'd better.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.030
Seg?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.150
- <i>Seg?</i>
- Fan out.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.750
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

29:29.960 --> 29:31.470
- <i>Please, respond!</i>
- Grandpa?

29:31.680 --> 29:34.030
Grandpa?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.340
All right,
you three down there.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.070
- <i>Hear me?</i>
- Grandpa?

29:37.240 --> 29:38.790
- <i>Seg?</i>
- Grandpa, what is it?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.070
- What's wrong?
- <i>Listen.</i>

29:41.240 --> 29:43.310
<i>The power grid...
destroyed...</i>

29:45.040 --> 29:47.950
<i>I can't detonate...
explosives!</i>

29:48.120 --> 29:50.270
<i>You and Kem need to get
to the surface!</i>

30:05.320 --> 30:07.030
Seg, can you hear me?

30:07.400 --> 30:08.390
You need to get out
of there, Seg!

30:08.880 --> 30:10.390
- Val! Val!
- Seg!

30:10.560 --> 30:12.350
What are you still doing here?

30:12.520 --> 30:13.630
Seg and Kem are in the mine.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.710
I need to get them out
of there.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.150
You're supposed
to get to the surface!

30:16.320 --> 30:17.390
I have to get them out
before I go!

30:17.560 --> 30:19.230
- Val, we're out of time.
- He's my grandson!

30:19.400 --> 30:21.270
Val, hey.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.950
There's nothing more
you can do.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.910
We have to go.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.780
All right.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.150
Quickly, team.
We're on the clock here.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.780
After you've set your charges,
I need you to clear the area.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.870
- Understood?
- Copy that.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.390
Hey.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.030
What are you doing?

31:07.120 --> 31:08.440
What does it look like
I'm doing?

31:08.600 --> 31:10.190
It looks like you're
synching those bombs

31:10.360 --> 31:12.070
to a short-range detonator,
but I know that's not possible

31:12.240 --> 31:14.070
because that's not part
of the plan.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.870
Plan's changed, Kem.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.950
What are you talking about?

31:19.120 --> 31:21.270
Something's happened
to the power systems.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.910
Val can no longer
remotely detonate.

31:24.080 --> 31:24.950
Oh.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.510
So...

31:29.280 --> 31:31.660
Look, you need to
get your guys topside, okay?

31:32.240 --> 31:34.110
I'm gonna wait for as long as
I can before I set these off.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.550
It'll give you time
to clear the tunnels.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.750
What, I'm--I'm just supposed
to let you die?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.190
Seg, that's not gonna happen.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.990
I am not gonna--

33:32.160 --> 33:33.670
Adam?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.590
Adam, where are you?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.740
Adam!

33:54.080 --> 33:56.150
Please, don't do that again.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.950
I'm an old man.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.389
All right, then.
Come on.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.350
Naptime's over.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.909
Come on.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.550
- I can't.
- What is it?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.270
I c--

34:28.679 --> 34:30.870
I can't--I can't feel my legs.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.380
Try again.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.230
I'm not letting you go, Adam.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.659
Not now, not ever.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.800
What happened?

35:06.320 --> 35:08.030
Doomsday happened.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.430
The squad?

35:28.240 --> 35:29.790
Shit.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.230
What?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.040
Shit!

35:35.720 --> 35:37.430
I lost the detonator.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.110
Shit, I must have dropped it
in the mine.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.990
I gotta go get it.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.150
No, no, no.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.700
I can't--I can't let you
do that.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.820
It's not your choice,
brother.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.270
It's mine.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.580
Listen...

35:55.040 --> 35:56.830
If I don't do this...

35:57.520 --> 35:59.470
the Resistance will fall

36:00.120 --> 36:01.950
and countless people will die.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.190
I can't let that happen.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.710
You understand?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.230
Yeah, I do.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.030
Kem.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.910
It's no use.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.750
Now why would you go and do
a stupid thing like that?

36:36.960 --> 36:38.470
I think it's pretty obvious,
isn't it?

36:38.640 --> 36:41.750
I've got a death wish
and, uh, you needed saving.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.110
No.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.840
Kem, this is my responsibility.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.140
It's my responsibility,
not yours.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.150
Why, because you're an El

36:48.320 --> 36:49.910
and you want live up
to your name?

36:50.080 --> 36:51.710
Or because Zod is your son

36:51.880 --> 36:53.270
and you think this whole thing
is your fault?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.710
But it's not.
Everyone has a responsibility.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.980
You can't save everyone, Seg.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.870
You can't.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.750
Others have to step up.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.150
It is the only way
to save Krypton.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.110
And besides, there's a...

37:10.480 --> 37:12.510
there's a lost child who...

37:13.480 --> 37:15.030
who needs his father.

37:19.880 --> 37:20.590
Kem, don't do this.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.510
Hey...

37:23.520 --> 37:26.230
Remember when we used to pull
those scams in the Rankless?

37:28.520 --> 37:31.630
It was so stupid.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.950
But now it's my turn
to take the beating.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.580
No, you stay.
You stay with me, Kem.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.950
Please stay.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.990
I-I love you.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.910
Kem?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.470
Kem!

37:57.360 --> 37:58.110
Kem!

41:53.160 --> 41:55.270
- Adam, are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.350
Val.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.630
What happened?

42:00.800 --> 42:02.510
The--the tunnel collapsed.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.670
- What? Where's Seg?
- I don't know.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.150
- What's happening?
- It's the Stellarium.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.070
Seg and Kem must have managed
to detonate it.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.670
I thought the reaction would be
localized but it's spreading!

42:15.880 --> 42:17.150
What are you saying?

42:21.720 --> 42:23.630
The moon is ripping apart.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.140
It's all my fault.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.790
No, we've gotta
get out of here.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.710
Seg?

42:30.400 --> 42:32.750
- Seg!
- Val, we've gotta go!

42:33.320 --> 42:35.310
Seg...

42:55.000 --> 42:55.870
Come on.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.150
Come on!
