WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:05.080
We are interested in a book in
the possession of Edward Kelley

00:05.240 --> 00:08.200
And does this book
concern the Philosopher's stone?

00:08.360 --> 00:11.160
Some of this information dates back
to the 13th Century

00:11.320 --> 00:14.120
It's everything I know,
about the Book of Life.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.920
There are witch trials
spreading all across here.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.520
-The book might as well be on Mars.
-I must discharge my duties.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.160
<i>My father commands me</i>
<i>to return to Sept-Tours.</i>

00:22.320 --> 00:24.840
I will escort you to the beach in
Mont Saint-Michel, but no further.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
My father died at
the hands of the French.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.920
The journey will take months.

00:29.080 --> 00:33.160
I'm the only one connected to the book.
You need me.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.640
A witch? You spoke civilly to one,
I'd be concerned, but married?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.960
I expect you to take me
at my word.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.160
You think if we go,
you get your Matthew back.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.800
I have wit enough to know
that he has never been that.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.840
You know what I mean.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.840
I am nothing without Diana!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.960
And if you can't accept that,
then you are no friend of mine.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.280
<i>This could bring the whole</i>
<i>De Clairmont Dynasty</i>

00:56.440 --> 00:58.680
<i>crashing to its knees.</i>

00:58.840 --> 01:00.600
Blood-rage is back.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.760
The disease lives in our blood.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.800
In 1,500 years,

01:04.960 --> 01:07.240
Matthew has never mated.
It's forever.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.160
On this moment,
we will always be one.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.320
You are my beloved son
and you are now my daughter.

01:14.480 --> 01:18.200
In this suitcase of clothes,
your mother added this. It's her ring

01:18.360 --> 01:21.480
Philippe always puts
a coin in the wax.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.640
I know seeing him again
will re-open old wounds,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.880
and maybe it will heal them too.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.160
Not before making them
worse, I assure you.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.200
We have to tell someone
we're here?

02:03.360 --> 02:05.760
They already know.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.000
Philippe's men?

02:08.160 --> 02:11.400
Seems he has sent
a welcoming party.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.880
Are they friend or foe?

02:14.040 --> 02:16.800
That's a complicated question.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.480
He hasn't sent them
to protect us?

02:18.640 --> 02:21.680
That is certainly
what he will claim.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.840
Gallowglass, my father waits
for no man, say your farewells.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.080
This is as far
as I can go with you.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.080
-Thank you for getting us here.
-The pleasure is all mine.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.760
I will travel ahead
to Krivolklat.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.840
Rudolph's favorite palace
awaits me.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.720
God willing,
I will meet you there.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.200
Just follow the trail
of vanquished enemies

02:45.360 --> 02:47.400
and satisfied women.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.400
My lady.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.080
Do not lose him.
Or yourself.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.240
And when Philippe
asks after you?

03:06.400 --> 03:08.680
Tell him I am my father's son.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.120
Apologies, Sir.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.760
My apologies.

05:00.080 --> 05:04.480
But you should know by now
that I find mornings most objectionable.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.320
Good Lord, man.
No manners?

05:32.960 --> 05:34.840
Do you hear me, man?
It's daylight.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.240
Take the whore back
to your lodgings.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.600
Best not be here
when I come back

05:43.480 --> 05:45.160
Kit?

05:47.720 --> 05:49.520
Louisa!

05:51.360 --> 05:52.840
What brings you to London?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.360
A need to escape
the tedium of Venice mainly.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.560
So, I came to see my brother,

05:58.720 --> 06:01.640
but it seems Matthew
isn't at home.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.520
Yes. He is away to France.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.480
Summoned by our father,
no doubt.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.320
And why aren't you with him?
Aren't you two joined at the hip?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.640
Not these days.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.840
It seems I am surplus
to requirements.

06:20.960 --> 06:26.120
Come.
We have much to discuss.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.800
<i>-Mon seigneur, madame.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

06:34.960 --> 06:37.440
I take comfort knowing
the French revolution

06:37.600 --> 06:40.960
is a mere two hundred years
from now.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.120
If only the sexual revolution
was a little earlier.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.320
Although I have to say.
I am looking forward

06:49.480 --> 06:51.360
to seeing Ysabeau
in these times again.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.080
Imagine she'd stand for it.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.280
She won't be there.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.880
As I recall, she spent most
of this year in Trier.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.000
At the witch trials...

07:03.440 --> 07:05.880
This is the woman who'll
accept me into her family

07:06.040 --> 07:08.840
and give me
her cherished ring?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.720
A lot can happen in 400 years.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.280
A witch?

07:21.840 --> 07:24.200
It must be
some sort of enchantment?

07:24.360 --> 07:28.600
Surely it's the only way
Matthew would suffer a witch.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.680
Seem that
he has been enchanted,

07:32.880 --> 07:34.760
but by love

07:36.160 --> 07:37.640
not sorcery.

07:41.720 --> 07:46.320
And so it seems I am in London
without my brother to chaperone me.

07:46.480 --> 07:51.760
How will I ever
amuse myself?

07:54.480 --> 07:56.200
I have a notion.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.160
I appreciate
the sentiment...

07:59.320 --> 08:02.640
The sentiment has nothing
to do with it.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
Well, this is unprecedented.

08:11.480 --> 08:15.800
Broken,
and yet it still beats for him.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.440
Does he know?

08:21.480 --> 08:23.720
Oh, poor Kit.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.880
Seems I have arrived too
late to save my brother

08:28.040 --> 08:30.720
from the clutches of his witch.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.280
But I'm just in time to save you
from melancholy.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.440
What did you have in mind?

08:41.560 --> 08:43.880
Where are we?

08:44.040 --> 08:46.000
We are now
in the province of Anjou.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.120
A region which refuses
to acknowledge

08:48.280 --> 08:50.160
the Protestant King's claim.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.520
As you know, these are
dangerous times, Diana.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.720
Who's side is Phillipe on?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.400
My father doesn't care

08:59.560 --> 09:03.240
for the subtleties
of the Christian schism.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.920
He's just trying to stop France
from being torn apart by it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.640
He's right to do that.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.880
Thousands of people
who'd prefer to starve

09:11.040 --> 09:13.000
than to bow
before a Protestant king.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.840
Rather reasons that my father
thinks that humans

09:16.000 --> 09:20.960
can't be trusted to sort out the mess
they find themselves in.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.520
Well, history has proved him right
time and time again.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.560
All the more reason for us
to be careful.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
Thankfully, we have
an armed guard.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.520
Well, our escort isn't
the fatherly gesture

09:34.680 --> 09:36.640
of kindness and concern.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.800
I thought they're here
to make sure we go straight

09:38.960 --> 09:42.240
to Sept-Tours without
diversions or delays.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.360
It isn't just that.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.520
They're a reminder that
the closer I get to Phillipe,

09:48.680 --> 09:50.320
the less freedom I have.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.400
We must present ourselves
to him or our path to Bohemia

09:53.560 --> 09:58.120
and the book will be blocked,
but I wish it wasn't so.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.080
Your turn.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.440
I'm not distracting you, am I?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.560
Not in the slightest.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.480
-Not in the slightest.
-Oi!

10:40.640 --> 10:44.040
You're waking up the whole
of the Blackfriars!

10:44.200 --> 10:45.840
What do you two think
you're up to?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.320
Nothing that may concern you.
Move along.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.440
It's my concern
that you're out past curfew.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.400
So, you and your little whore
better make yourself scarce.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.720
That's the second time
someone has called me a whore.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.520
I don't like it.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.000
Tell me, am I better company
than my brother?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.040
Infinitely.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.440
Good morning,

11:44.600 --> 11:46.200
The weather has turned
for the worst

11:46.360 --> 11:49.320
and we need to make up
good ground today.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.920
Give me a minute.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.560
I always underestimate
a warmblood's need for sleep,

11:55.720 --> 11:58.440
not that you haven't earned it.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.080
This is not an easy journey.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.120
Especially, if you have to ride
side saddle.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.160
Yeah, I noticed.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.000
I'll make sure Pierre has some
hot food for you

12:09.160 --> 12:11.400
before we set off, alright?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.400
Thank you.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.160
Well, there's one more thing
I'm afraid.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.880
I love you entirely.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.640
Now, off you get.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.280
A scout reported soldiers in the area.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.080
Ride ahead.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.880
-We need to check for survivors.
-No, we need to keep moving.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.120
The soldiers that did this
could be nearby.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.640
Diana?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.080
Diana?

14:18.080 --> 14:19.880
Diana?

14:25.840 --> 14:28.640
Ah, you decided
to join us again, have you?

14:28.800 --> 14:32.720
I only closed my eyes
for a second.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.520
It's my fault

14:34.680 --> 14:37.640
I should have never put
you through this.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.120
Wherever you go, I go.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.680
Come. Let's get you by the fire.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.760
Come and get warm.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.880
That's it.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.560
-Yeah.
-Oh.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.320
You need your strength
for Sept-Tours.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.720
You should get some sleep.
Best be rested for what is ahead.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.960
You as well

15:10.360 --> 15:12.440
I get it, Pierre.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.800
No one can hide
the truth from Philippe.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.760
No one.
No matter how hard they try.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.080
I'm sorry.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.640
It's just everything that
Matthew and I have been through,

15:31.800 --> 15:34.160
all that we have endured,

15:34.320 --> 15:36.960
I'll be damned
if I'm going to allow his stepfather

15:37.120 --> 15:40.320
to be the one thing
that gets between us.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.080
Surely he wants Matthew
to be happy.

15:43.240 --> 15:47.120
To be with someone he loves.
Someone who loves him.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.320
All I know is that Milord
will need you at Sept-Tours.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.000
You must be his guiding light.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.360
My Lord!

16:05.880 --> 16:07.760
Let's get you to bed.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.040
This journey

16:22.200 --> 16:25.960
is so much harder than I ever
thought it would be.

16:26.120 --> 16:30.640
Hmm. Yes.
I'm sorry.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.800
I know it's just
as hard for you.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.880
You know,
but no matter what,

16:52.640 --> 16:54.960
I'm always yours.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.520
And I am yours.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.440
Then let me have you.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.120
Not yet. Not now.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.760
In time.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.560
Something you'd like to say?

19:31.720 --> 19:34.520
Nothing at all,
Mistress Roydon.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.240
-Comfortable?
-Yes.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.440
I believe this is
where I leave you, Milord.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.840
-If that is still what you wish.
-Yes, it is.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.320
Find us lodgings in Bohemia

19:48.480 --> 19:51.160
and we'll be with you
as soon as we can.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.240
Don't look at me like that.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.120
Someone has to keep
an eye on Gallowglass.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.600
I'm quite sure he will already
have got himself into trouble

19:59.760 --> 20:01.600
by the time you arrive.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.320
Mistress Roydon.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.160
If we don't waste time,
we'll be at Sept-Tours by nightfall.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.640
I wish I could prepare you
for whatever is about to happen.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.760
Do not try and read Philippe.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.800
I spent centuries with my father

21:10.960 --> 21:13.280
and I could never tell
what he's thinking.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.480
Ysabeau didn't exactly
welcome me with open arms.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.720
Neither did I.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.600
It's you I'm worried about.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.240
I can see how hard
this has been.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.960
When we lose someone we love
we'd give anything

21:37.120 --> 21:40.560
to have them back,
even just a moment.

21:42.440 --> 21:47.040
But the reality of that
is quite different.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.840
Yes.
I've lost so many people.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.640
I've always found a place
for them in my heart.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.080
But it's the wound
that never heals.

22:02.240 --> 22:07.040
And when I see Phillipe again,
that wound will get ripped open.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.120
-Leave us.
-Thank you, sir.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.440
It seemed so empty
last time we were here.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.360
Even when it echoes with
voices, it can still feel lonely

24:35.640 --> 24:37.560
Matthew.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.320
Explain yourself.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.960
Well?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.880
I'm here.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.760
As commanded.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.040
And that is your explanation?

25:51.200 --> 25:54.200
I'm sure your spies have told you
everything else you need to know.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.760
You should have told me
yourself about your witch.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.360
-Diana.
-And yet she is still a witch.

26:05.360 --> 26:09.360
I'm not just a witch.
I'm a weaver.

26:11.880 --> 26:15.560
Do you think
I am impressed by that?

26:17.320 --> 26:22.880
There is nothing new
under the sun

26:23.040 --> 26:24.880
for me.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.760
I have lived a long life.

26:29.920 --> 26:35.120
I've seen things that you've
only read about in history books.

26:35.280 --> 26:40.280
Really? I've seen things that aren't
even in the history books...

26:40.440 --> 26:42.160
-Diana.
-...yet.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.800
No.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.160
Yes.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.280
Ah, yes, I see.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.320
Hmm.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.760
Hubbard told me
that you are a changed man.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.840
So, Hubbard was your informant?

27:05.000 --> 27:09.240
Yes, not that I should have
to rely on a messianic fanatic

27:09.400 --> 27:11.560
for news on one's own family.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.800
And yet...

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
...he only told me half the story.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.640
You seem...

27:22.800 --> 27:26.480
You seem out of place...

27:26.640 --> 27:28.400
Matthew.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.960
You're a time-walker

27:33.120 --> 27:35.560
and you've come to
this time for a reason.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.760
We were in serious danger.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.280
So? You're a weaver.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.520
-You have great power.
-That's what people keep telling me.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.200
I was spellbound as a child.

27:53.360 --> 27:56.640
I needed to find a teacher,
one I couldn't find in my own time.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.840
Hmm. Complication
upon complication.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.600
I do not disagree with you.

28:02.760 --> 28:07.360
If I can offer any clarity
it is this...

28:07.520 --> 28:11.120
I love Matthew
and he loves me.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.000
Please don't doubt
my feelings for Diana.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.600
Surely you are the one
with doubts.

28:21.560 --> 28:27.320
If this relationship
truly meant something to you...

28:27.480 --> 28:30.040
Please don't!

28:30.200 --> 28:33.440
...you would have
consummated it

28:34.400 --> 28:36.560
by now.

28:36.720 --> 28:41.880
Did you really expect me
not to know?

28:42.040 --> 28:47.600
You both have
very distinct scents.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.080
And as you know,
if you were mated...

28:52.240 --> 28:53.680
That's enough.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.240
You're tired.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.600
Your rooms should be ready.

29:07.840 --> 29:12.800
I do hope you don't
expect to share a bed?

29:26.720 --> 29:29.600
He knew before I even
opened my mouth. Didn't he?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.440
-And you lied to me.
-It wasn't a lie.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.040
As far as I'm concerned,
we are mated.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.120
-Everything I do is to protect you.
-I don't need your protection!

29:39.280 --> 29:41.000
I knew there was something.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.520
You are all that I could ever want.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.160
Then why
are you holding back?

29:46.320 --> 29:48.600
-It's complicated.
-Is it?

29:48.760 --> 29:51.800
Oh, your father
doesn't seem to think so.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.320
Or maybe you should bed him!

30:04.160 --> 30:06.520
Get out!

30:36.200 --> 30:39.360
I will not insult you by pretending
I did not hear all that.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.520
I assume that was
the desired effect.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.120
Of what?

30:45.280 --> 30:49.440
Of your unwelcome intervention
into my relationship with Diana!

30:49.600 --> 30:52.560
Unwelcome? Perhaps.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.960
Necessary?
Without question.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.520
How long do you think it would have
been before your lie was discovered?

30:59.680 --> 31:02.800
I have never lied to her!

31:04.880 --> 31:09.400
The sin of omission, Matthew.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.800
And you are still sinning.

31:11.960 --> 31:17.200
That's between myself and Diana.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.360
If only that were true.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.360
When did you last feed?

31:27.520 --> 31:29.200
What?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.240
Well, it's a long journey,

31:32.400 --> 31:35.280
probably had
little opportunity to hunt.

31:37.440 --> 31:41.800
Are you actually asking me
if I'm eating enough?

31:43.240 --> 31:47.320
Am I not allowed
to be concerned

31:47.480 --> 31:49.520
for my son?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.720
Oh, I see.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.040
What do you think you see?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.640
There is a schism

32:02.920 --> 32:05.360
between us in your time.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.040
Don't.

32:10.200 --> 32:15.240
You bear ill will towards
something I am yet to do?

32:22.800 --> 32:26.920
Ah, and the matter is closed.

32:27.080 --> 32:33.880
On the proviso that,
in the morning, you hunt,

32:34.040 --> 32:36.280
you feed.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.440
As you wish.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.480
Good morning, Milady.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.480
-If you are ready?
-No, I'm not ready.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.760
Excuse me?

34:05.280 --> 34:09.480
I'm not ready to get dressed.
I'll do it myself.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.880
You're excused.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.200
Ugh, fine.

34:37.120 --> 34:42.160
Good morning.
I trust you slept well.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.600
Yes.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.560
The bed was perfectly adequate.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.680
If a little empty?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.760
Have you spoken to Matthew
this morning?

34:54.920 --> 34:58.480
I believe he's in the stables
as he plans to hunt today.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.840
I don't think
they've ridden out yet.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.960
Would you like me
to show you the way?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.800
No, thank you.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.720
I'm not sure I'm ready
to talk to him just yet.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.440
Oh, my fault, I'm afraid.

35:10.600 --> 35:17.280
I do hope you understand why I couldn't
allow you to share your bed with him.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.560
Your home, your rules.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.600
Quite right.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.400
Oh, and...
On that matter...

35:25.560 --> 35:29.920
In my wife's absence you are the
highest-ranking woman in Sept-Tours.

35:30.080 --> 35:34.160
-So these are yours.
-And what do they open?

35:34.320 --> 35:37.560
The food store,
the bakehouse, the laundry...

35:37.720 --> 35:39.720
Ah!

35:39.880 --> 35:44.120
I won't be here long enough
to take charge of your domestic matters.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.360
Oh, I had hoped that

35:46.520 --> 35:51.040
you would accept these
as a gesture.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.360
As mark of my respect.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.360
Which one opens the library?

36:01.800 --> 36:05.520
Oh, we do not lock up
books in this house.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.560
Reading seldom leads
to bad behavior.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.200
Oh, you'd be surprised.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.640
Please.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.320
Take anything you like.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.040
I'll leave you to your reading.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.520
Shh!

37:37.680 --> 37:40.560
A witch?
Haven't we enough?

37:40.720 --> 37:42.920
He was most insistent.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.360
Monsieur Andre Champier, Milord.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.840
Thank you for seeing me,
Sir Philippe.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.800
I need to speak to you
on a matter of some urgency.

38:04.640 --> 38:08.160
You're fortunate
my wife isn't at home.

38:08.320 --> 38:12.000
You would've encountered
a far different reception.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.360
My apologies for the intrusion.

38:58.520 --> 39:01.920
A matter of
some urgency has arisen.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.200
Allow me to introduce
Monsieur Andre Champier.

39:05.360 --> 39:08.800
Monsieur Champier claims that

39:08.960 --> 39:11.760
he was summoned here by you.

39:11.920 --> 39:16.040
I sensed a great power.
It seems I was right.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.400
-He asked to see you immediately.
-And you immediately obliged?

39:20.560 --> 39:25.160
It's not for me to interfere
in the business of witches.

39:25.320 --> 39:29.240
And you say she has no recollection
whatsoever of her past?

39:29.400 --> 39:31.240
No.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.160
I was most fortunate
my son found her when he did.

39:34.320 --> 39:38.640
-That's not true.
-Please, I'm here to help.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.000
-I don't need help.
-Fear not.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.640
There are ways to unlock
painful memories.

39:52.360 --> 39:55.280
There are deep wounds here.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.360
-Who has been feeding from you?
-Nobody.

40:04.520 --> 40:07.040
-Traitor.
-No.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.760
-You are the traitor!
-We shall see.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.400
-What is this?
-Nothing.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.400
Sir Philippe, I'm afraid you
have a traitor in your house.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.280
-No!
-A traitor who keeps secrets.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.680
But they are secrets
I can easily extract.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.880
This woman is not
who she pretends.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.280
Your potential is
of great interest to me.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.000
You will thank me, my dear.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.480
I will remove
all that haunts you.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.080
What are you talking about?

40:41.240 --> 40:45.200
Your memories.
Give them to me.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.560
They're mine!

40:54.360 --> 40:56.400
Just let me in.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.840
Why... Why are you doing this?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.880
Free yourself.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.520
That's it.
Just a little further.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.680
A little deeper. Yes!

41:13.360 --> 41:15.360
No!

41:23.720 --> 41:26.800
I said no!

41:30.960 --> 41:34.040
Diana. Enough!

41:56.840 --> 41:58.400
This minor's life, why?

41:58.560 --> 42:02.480
Lives will be lost
because of your union.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.160
<i>She knows too many</i>
<i>of our secrets.</i>

42:05.320 --> 42:08.200
And I do not take risks
with my family.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.560
There's something wrong
with the witches.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.920
Something strange is happening.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.960
Whatever it is, it's focused here,

42:18.120 --> 42:19.960
in this room.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.920
I need to know that
Matthew and Diana are safe.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.480
This map,
do you know what it is?

42:31.640 --> 42:36.720
It is names of witches
and placement of covens.

42:36.880 --> 42:41.600
Madame de Clermont relies on these
maps to guide her witch hunts.

42:47.520 --> 42:51.240
This is why we can
never be truly mated.

42:52.240 --> 42:57.400
Do you really think that I
would ever walk away from you?
