WEBVTT

00:11.432 --> 00:13.932
My marriage was a sham.

00:14.422 --> 00:17.703
I'm with Interpol, Serious
Financial Crime Agency.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.820
Your husband had the copy made for
some oligarch to put on his yacht.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.032
I see it in you now.
That look.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.420
What look?
Revenge!

00:30.595 --> 00:33.211
They were laundering money
on a massive scale.

00:35.681 --> 00:38.334
You know, you learn so much more
about people after they're dead.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.331
I found him.
I found John Brandeis.

00:48.306 --> 00:49.817
Choosing a blind man?

00:51.254 --> 00:53.816
That is the Constantine Clios touch.

00:54.682 --> 00:56.322
A blind art dealer?

00:57.759 --> 01:01.242
There is no John Brandeis.
It was just Constantine.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.462
Moving money around.
We don't know that, Georgie, we

01:04.492 --> 01:06.251
We don't know Constantine's side.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.752
He wasn't the only one using
the Safe Room, Christos was too.

01:09.782 --> 01:13.290
No one is who they seem, are they?
Christos is an addict.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.526
Do you think he's capable of this?
There is no John Brandeis.

01:18.571 --> 01:20.543
You're right!
I have to talk to Christos.

<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

01:34.436 --> 01:38.177
<i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist</i>

01:38.207 --> 01:41.916
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

01:41.946 --> 01:45.196
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

01:45.226 --> 01:49.010
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

01:49.510 --> 01:52.514
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

01:52.544 --> 01:58.960
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

02:00.025 --> 02:03.578
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:03.608 --> 02:06.943
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:06.973 --> 02:14.539
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:14.569 --> 02:18.509
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:18.539 --> 02:22.003
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:22.033 --> 02:29.658
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

03:09.534 --> 03:09.932
Allo!

03:11.141 --> 03:14.635
Hi! Yes, this is Georgina Clios.
I'm here to see Christos.

03:14.932 --> 03:16.407
He isn't here, I'm afraid.

03:16.437 --> 03:18.854
Can you tell him, again,
that I am trying to reach him?

03:19.311 --> 03:20.888
Of course. Goodbye.

04:45.891 --> 04:47.203
Hey, thanks for meeting me here.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.222
Well, I thought we
better speak face to face.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.687
Why, what is it?
I checked the Brandeis account.

04:52.941 --> 04:55.462
And?
The Manovich money, the 30 million...

04:55.846 --> 04:57.526
It was in the account
until a few days ago.

04:57.556 --> 04:59.354
What do you mean?
It's gone.

05:01.039 --> 05:05.225
Gone! But that means that
someone had to take it.

05:05.432 --> 05:07.230
After Constantine died.

05:07.584 --> 05:08.822
All of it?
Yes.

05:09.578 --> 05:11.509
If Constantine didn't take it, then...

05:13.441 --> 05:17.554
Christos! He's the
only one who had access to it.

05:18.088 --> 05:21.170
What do you want to do?
I'm going to get some answers.

07:05.507 --> 07:07.512
Ok, cash or card?
Cash.

07:07.955 --> 07:09.178
Wouldn't want
my husband to find out.

09:16.545 --> 09:19.390
No, those are going in the back.
You take all of those in the back.

09:20.890 --> 09:23.499
This is good, good, good.
I like all this.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.252
You know bushes,
it's here is the important part.

09:26.282 --> 09:30.748
It's like, here,we want them,
this is what they see, the rest is...

09:31.249 --> 09:33.062
Who looks back here?
No one, right?

09:33.747 --> 09:36.799
That's where people come in.
That what people see.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.777
No, this is the wrong...
It's 0-3.

09:39.807 --> 09:42.253
That's not 0-3. You're pretty.
You have a pretty mouth.

09:42.283 --> 09:44.244
All the pretty girls
in the hallway, you know?

09:44.274 --> 09:46.822
And you can come with me.
It's good. You look good.Who the fuck?

09:59.795 --> 10:00.591
Who the fuck?

10:01.903 --> 10:03.068
It's gonna be a long day.

12:02.047 --> 12:02.593
Nadia!

12:08.930 --> 12:10.404
I look awful.

12:11.038 --> 12:12.218
Can we try something new?

12:12.409 --> 12:14.252
What kind of statement
would you like to make?

12:15.004 --> 12:16.198
Something that says...

12:17.481 --> 12:18.601
don't fuck with me.

12:22.013 --> 12:22.662
Fuck!

12:26.038 --> 12:26.583
Shit!

12:56.242 --> 12:56.994
Perfect.

13:13.823 --> 13:17.258
Just sprucing up for
some marathon shmoozing.

13:17.288 --> 13:19.307
Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring.

13:19.646 --> 13:22.241
I think you look perfect as you are.
Very funny.

13:26.088 --> 13:26.913
It's nice.

13:28.078 --> 13:28.962
It suits you.

13:31.704 --> 13:34.697
Is it new?
You don't remember?

13:37.275 --> 13:38.690
I was wearing it
the night we met.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.371
the opera.

13:40.401 --> 13:43.172
Oh, yes. Of course.
How could I forget!

13:44.216 --> 13:45.734
You looked very handsome that night.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.700
And I remember thinking: wow...

13:50.953 --> 13:53.842
my new stepmother's about
10 minutes older than me!

14:23.588 --> 14:24.856
Whatever's going on,

14:25.888 --> 14:27.775
whatever trouble
he's left us with,

14:30.989 --> 14:31.682
I'm here.

14:36.941 --> 14:38.194
Is it that obvious?

14:41.717 --> 14:42.926
You're not alone, you know.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.454
It's all so confusing.

15:02.341 --> 15:03.255
You smell like him.

15:06.843 --> 15:08.082
I feel like him.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.726
No, Adam!

16:25.384 --> 16:26.371
Well, hello!

16:47.861 --> 16:48.569
Hi!

16:49.262 --> 16:50.957
Sophie, you came!
Yeah.

16:52.416 --> 16:55.645
Sophia, if you see your brothers,
send them my way.

16:56.047 --> 16:57.005
Yes, Mother.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.160
So nice to see you.

18:04.087 --> 18:06.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Georgina!

18:08.845 --> 18:10.422
Hey, Georgina!

18:11.631 --> 18:12.427
Georgine!

18:21.238 --> 18:23.007
Chris, where the hell is Christos?

18:23.037 --> 18:25.174
Someone needs to be in
the Main Room and the Hall.

18:25.351 --> 18:28.049
Originality thrives in a
non-commercial setting.

18:28.079 --> 18:30.216
It's the fire that the elite depends on.

18:30.392 --> 18:33.222
Resistance on the anti-institution,

18:33.252 --> 18:34.829
it's a beutiful symbiosis.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.060
We feed off them;
commodifying and using them

18:39.491 --> 18:43.147
And then, turn up at
splendid balls like this.

18:56.446 --> 18:57.905
Madame, pleased to...
Thank you

18:57.935 --> 18:58.790
...wonderful to be here.

18:59.306 --> 18:59.763
Excuse me...

19:04.002 --> 19:07.127
Wow, you could have
made an effort, Georgie.

19:07.157 --> 19:08.395
Kill me now.

19:11.809 --> 19:13.504
Hey! Oh, hey!

19:15.391 --> 19:17.691
Funny little dress.
Such a little bitch, though.

19:20.589 --> 19:24.805
Ok, who wants to get high?

19:26.033 --> 19:27.876
That's not very much for 3, is it?

19:29.011 --> 19:30.190
Uh, we're gonna do blowbacks.

19:31.414 --> 19:32.681
Blowbacks? What, what?

19:33.212 --> 19:34.922
Blowbacks.
What is that?

19:36.456 --> 19:38.520
Who's got a light?
I've got a light.

19:51.989 --> 19:55.129
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you for coming.

19:55.419 --> 19:56.952
Everyone...

19:58.692 --> 20:00.888
Thank you for supporting the Foundation.

20:01.522 --> 20:06.122
As you all know well, this auction
is part of the Clios heritage.

20:06.650 --> 20:12.502
And we are so glad to see the
same familiar faces every year.

20:12.532 --> 20:15.937
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you and of course,

20:17.965 --> 20:22.417
we thank Georgina for the
pleasure of this beautiful location,

20:22.933 --> 20:25.838
which is very dear to my heart.

20:26.313 --> 20:29.040
Let's celebrate our
beloved Constantine

20:29.070 --> 20:31.546
by having a good time tonight.

20:32.596 --> 20:36.208
Adele LeTissiet, leading light
of the international opera scene.

20:53.889 --> 20:54.508
Georgie?

20:57.648 --> 20:58.444
Is everything...

20:59.624 --> 21:00.184
Georgie?

21:09.722 --> 21:10.710
What is this?

21:14.213 --> 21:15.747
Is this live?

21:16.484 --> 21:19.034
Oh, my God,
you are fucking hardcore!

21:19.240 --> 21:22.145
How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!

21:42.421 --> 21:42.864
Adam...

21:49.230 --> 21:52.429
The auction is about to start.
Christos hasn't turned up

21:53.554 --> 21:54.257
What an idiot.

21:56.296 --> 21:57.180
What's he playing?

21:58.124 --> 21:59.347
You have to run the auction.

22:00.074 --> 22:00.678
Me?

22:02.919 --> 22:03.376
Yes.

22:04.747 --> 22:06.442
Fuck! Christos!
Are you serious?

22:07.035 --> 22:10.603
Yes! You're the oldest.
It has to be a Clios, naturally.

22:10.883 --> 22:12.446
That's the way things are done.

22:12.476 --> 22:15.969
This night, this gala might affect
the situation of every one of us.

22:16.702 --> 22:17.174
Great.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.568
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.782
This is all very impressive.

22:29.812 --> 22:31.256
That's very kind of you.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.736
A vision!
Oh, forgive me...

22:33.766 --> 22:37.142
I had a few things I had to tie up.
Please, not another word.

22:39.564 --> 22:40.920
So impressive of you, I thought,

22:40.950 --> 22:43.868
to hold such an event so
soon after your terrible loss.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.451
I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't...
No, not at all!

22:47.985 --> 22:50.594
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.

22:53.749 --> 22:57.936
This is the center of the collection.
You'll find this in the Main Room.

22:58.385 --> 23:00.596
All the artworks are to be removed

23:00.626 --> 23:02.896
and all of them handled
with the utmost care.

23:03.117 --> 23:06.007
You'll enter the property at midnight,
on my command. Is that clear?

23:06.037 --> 23:08.046
Yes, sir!
Alright.

23:16.221 --> 23:17.224
Good evening.

23:18.418 --> 23:19.597
Good evening, everyone!

23:23.681 --> 23:27.262
Ok, let's not stand on ceremony, let's

23:28.854 --> 23:30.711
jump straight in with

23:32.126 --> 23:38.159
item number one in your catalogue:
"A drive around the circuit in Monaco",

23:38.513 --> 23:40.031
beginning bidding at...

23:44.318 --> 23:47.723
50 thousand! Now don't be shy,
do we see 50 thousand?

23:47.944 --> 23:51.600
50! Do I see 55?
55! I see 55...

23:52.108 --> 23:53.803
Do I see 60?

23:54.127 --> 23:57.149
Your hand up? Do we see 60?
Is that 70, sir, or...

23:57.179 --> 23:59.552
...wonderful hair. 70!

23:59.582 --> 24:01.166
That's gone to you.
Thank you very well!

24:01.196 --> 24:04.173
Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.
Yes!

24:04.697 --> 24:07.145
I believe the last time
you and I saw each other,

24:07.175 --> 24:09.017
we were bidding on the Malevich.

24:09.695 --> 24:12.923
You won that one, I guess.
Have you still got that Mondrian:

24:12.953 --> 24:14.508
"Study In Composition number 2"?

24:14.538 --> 24:17.416
Red and Blue! Yes, of course,
that's one of our favorites.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.188
Constantine hung a
Rauschenberg next to it

24:20.350 --> 24:23.225
and would talk about the
unbroken tradition between the two.

24:23.377 --> 24:25.337
Yes, your son was
saying a similar thing.

24:25.367 --> 24:26.015
Stepson!

24:27.667 --> 24:29.288
I didn't realize that
you two were close.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.984
We were talking about the collection.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.549
I was interested, of course.

24:33.904 --> 24:36.071
100,000 Euros,up...
Sorry?

24:36.867 --> 24:38.061
I was just saying...

24:39.417 --> 24:41.142
no matter.
Georgina!

24:41.172 --> 24:42.911
Have you seen Dawn and Sophie?
I've lost them.

24:42.941 --> 24:46.275
No, sweetheart, I haven't.
I'm sorry, you were interested...

24:51.788 --> 24:54.000
Are you ready to talk?
You can't do this!

24:54.030 --> 24:55.619
Christos...
You're psychotic!

24:55.649 --> 24:57.344
Maybe.
Give me the bloody key!

24:57.374 --> 24:59.894
First, tell me...
Tell you what? Give me the key.

24:59.924 --> 25:01.353
Give me the fucking key!

25:02.404 --> 25:04.321
Christos...
What is it, what do you want?

25:04.674 --> 25:07.225
Ok, for starters, I have
Jeffrey Anderton upstairs

25:07.255 --> 25:09.864
eyeing out my collection
like it's a fucking yard sale.

25:09.894 --> 25:11.858
Anderton! Is that what this...

25:13.436 --> 25:16.163
Fucking idiot, it's called
evaluation and you're insane!

25:16.193 --> 25:18.522
Those are my paintings.
Give me the fucking key!

25:18.688 --> 25:20.148
I met John Brandeis.

25:21.755 --> 25:24.895
Oh, good for you.
Not really what I expected.

25:25.145 --> 25:26.428
Well, who is, huh?

25:27.622 --> 25:30.040
You, for example. No one
had you down for such a cunt.

25:32.841 --> 25:33.548
I see.

25:40.445 --> 25:44.838
90,000 Euros for this gentleman here,
95! 95 thousand Euros here!

25:44.868 --> 25:48.686
Now, do I see
one hundred thousand Euros?

25:48.716 --> 25:50.857
Get it out!
One hundred thousand Euros!

25:51.539 --> 25:54.561
One hundred thousand Euros!

25:54.591 --> 25:56.654
Gone to the man in the fine spectacles

25:56.684 --> 25:59.500
and now to the most
coveted soprano in the world!

26:20.362 --> 26:23.060
You got him to talk yet?
It won't be long now.

26:28.692 --> 26:29.591
Mrs. Clios...

27:50.984 --> 27:51.928
Are we nearly there?

27:51.958 --> 27:54.375
We'll wait until
the Service gates open.

27:54.596 --> 27:56.807
Enter the property from both sides.

28:11.163 --> 28:12.018
Hello.

28:15.851 --> 28:17.723
Are you crying?
No.

28:26.992 --> 28:30.000
So? Boy trouble?
Not exactly.

28:30.563 --> 28:32.804
Why don't you
come back to the party?

28:33.084 --> 28:35.502
Your brother's doing a very fine job.

28:35.532 --> 28:38.494
I just lost out a dance
with a beautiful woman.

28:39.515 --> 28:42.596
Maybe, I could have one with you.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.308
No, thank you.
Hmm.

28:45.647 --> 28:48.889
Well, surely there is something
we can do to cheer you up.

28:49.213 --> 28:52.648
A wee little thing like you
should be enjoying yourself.

28:54.255 --> 28:55.861
Do you like to get high?

28:58.828 --> 29:03.885
Mm, naughty girl.
I only have this much.

29:05.963 --> 29:08.882
Uh, we can do blowbacks.

29:13.321 --> 29:17.242
Oh, it's been a while
since I've had that...

29:17.982 --> 29:21.166
but I don't think so.
Do you have a light?

29:21.845 --> 29:22.759
Hm, sure!

29:25.029 --> 29:26.798
I knew I would be of some use.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.709
Stupid fucking bitch!
You don't know anything.

29:53.739 --> 29:56.510
Isn't it time you fucked off?
Back to Wisconsin

29:56.540 --> 29:58.397
or whatever fucking hole
you came from!

29:59.902 --> 30:01.848
Brandeis was a front, obviously...

30:03.101 --> 30:04.796
to launder money, right?

30:05.135 --> 30:07.155
So what, your Dad
didn't think he had enough?

30:19.694 --> 30:22.922
The Bank was fucked.
Dad compartmentalized.

30:22.952 --> 30:25.222
He was trying to save the ank.
How?

30:27.669 --> 30:28.687
How?

30:41.222 --> 30:41.959
Elena.

30:44.097 --> 30:44.952
Who is she?

30:52.192 --> 30:54.241
You're missing a fantastic party.

31:02.021 --> 31:03.303
What are you doing?

31:04.895 --> 31:07.107
Oh, relax, Mom!

31:10.368 --> 31:11.695
Marcello, go back outside.

31:12.049 --> 31:14.172
Irina, hold on...
Don't she's a child!

31:14.202 --> 31:15.130
I'm not a child.

31:15.793 --> 31:17.610
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:17.640 --> 31:20.632
Adriana!
I'm just trying to be normal for once

31:20.662 --> 31:23.787
but you ruin everything! You
fucking live to fucking embarrass me!

31:24.130 --> 31:26.695
You don't need any help with that!
Whoring yourself!

31:35.034 --> 31:35.757
No...

31:37.496 --> 31:39.428
because I learned from the very best

32:00.177 --> 32:04.438
Why you never strike me
as the jealous type, Irina.

32:06.162 --> 32:08.565
How dare you!
What?

32:08.864 --> 32:12.343
She was crying. I just sat next to her.
She's my daughter!

32:14.510 --> 32:18.240
I don't want you anywhere near her.
Oh, what makes you so upset?

32:19.603 --> 32:22.772
You were never the most trivialist mother.
It doesn't suit you.

32:23.922 --> 32:25.057
I think you should leave.

32:26.664 --> 32:29.465
I'd like that very much, Jakob.
Leave?

32:30.162 --> 32:31.430
Yes, leave.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.496
I'm sorry for our misunderstanding.

32:45.016 --> 32:48.510
Beautiful piece of work,
kindly donated by Lorenzo Quid...

32:48.540 --> 32:50.033
with the added bonus

32:50.063 --> 32:53.748
that he will personally
hand deliver it to your home!

32:54.750 --> 32:56.003
and maybe stay for dinner.

32:57.195 --> 33:00.659
Ezcellent, let's start the bidding
at 90. Do I have any advances on 90?

33:08.827 --> 33:10.906
So, any advances on 90?

33:12.439 --> 33:15.196
Thank you, Madame!
Do I see 95?

33:36.725 --> 33:37.786
Why did you do that?

33:38.689 --> 33:39.250
What?

33:39.766 --> 33:41.962
Dominique...
I didn't do.

33:41.992 --> 33:44.232
You know what I mean.
Well,

33:44.262 --> 33:45.932
where'd you come up
with that creepy old guy?

33:45.962 --> 33:47.406
To get back at you!

33:49.499 --> 33:52.919
Sorry.
Oh, fuck! I'm so high!

33:59.560 --> 34:00.975
You're so beautiful.

34:01.653 --> 34:04.351
You don't know what it feels like
to be outside of everything.

34:05.716 --> 34:06.821
I think you're scared.

34:09.489 --> 34:11.554
Duh, under it all, you're boring,

34:12.496 --> 34:13.735
like everyone else.

34:48.237 --> 34:49.860
Sophie's phone, leave a message.

35:16.194 --> 35:17.049
What are you doing?

35:18.265 --> 35:20.830
My job.
What are you doing here?

35:20.860 --> 35:24.088
My daughter, she's inside.
What's happening?

35:24.500 --> 35:26.948
Why am I not informed?
I have a warrant.

35:27.437 --> 35:29.030
We're seizing the Clios collection.

35:29.575 --> 35:33.172
Sold to the gentleman in the back
for 2 hundred thousand Euros.

35:33.202 --> 35:35.413
Thank you all very much
nd goodnight. Thank you.

35:44.265 --> 35:46.241
Christos! Christos, stop it!

35:46.938 --> 35:47.690
Stop it!

35:51.700 --> 35:52.201
Fuck!

36:20.045 --> 36:22.728
There's water,
there's water under the bed.

36:23.052 --> 36:24.335
Would you fucking get it!

37:21.399 --> 37:22.770
Please! Please!

37:23.595 --> 37:24.583
Neck!

37:25.983 --> 37:27.281
Just find a vein!

37:31.541 --> 37:33.723
Just fucking do it!
Just fucking do it!

37:34.386 --> 37:36.598
Please! Come on!

37:36.922 --> 37:37.644
Come on!

37:59.307 --> 38:00.163
Elena...

38:01.957 --> 38:03.873
Elena.
Who is she?

38:06.217 --> 38:09.063
No, it...
It's a file.

38:15.515 --> 38:16.724
Where is it?

38:18.331 --> 38:23.372
I think... Panama papers...
International fucking dangerous men...

38:23.856 --> 38:26.097
Heads of state... Elena...

38:27.306 --> 38:29.532
isn't fucking around.
Blackmail?

38:29.709 --> 38:31.729
Dirt right up to the Kremlin.

38:32.587 --> 38:36.611
Dodgy dealings, corruption, lies...

38:36.641 --> 38:39.751
Christos, where is it now?
At the bottom of the ocean.

38:39.781 --> 38:44.148
Smithereens, with Father and files

38:44.576 --> 38:47.952
and lies.
What about the bank account?

38:49.931 --> 38:50.948
The bank account?

38:51.198 --> 38:54.044
The Brandeis account,
the 30 million dollars!

38:54.235 --> 38:55.179
Do you have it?

38:56.804 --> 38:58.160
I don't have any money.

38:59.457 --> 39:00.607
Is there money?

39:01.728 --> 39:02.819
I don't know what you thought.

39:03.688 --> 39:04.263
Fuck!

39:05.691 --> 39:06.354
Chlorise!

39:08.595 --> 39:09.863
Where's I?lena

39:52.613 --> 39:53.143
Adam!

40:26.086 --> 40:28.209
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

40:30.093 --> 40:32.805
I was trying to save the Bank.

40:33.321 --> 40:37.346
I was trying to fix it but
Dad made so much mess.

40:39.795 --> 40:41.078
I fucking hated him.

40:44.173 --> 40:45.309
That's why I hated you.

40:55.471 --> 40:57.373
Ok, gents, let's go.

41:02.138 --> 41:03.936
You coming?
Of course I'm coming.

41:16.137 --> 41:17.169
Police! Good evening!

41:17.199 --> 41:19.661
We are the police. Please stay calm
and remain where you are.

41:22.315 --> 41:24.055
Move away from the art

41:28.360 --> 41:29.863
Where is the lady of the house?

41:30.364 --> 41:31.765
Stand aside, police!

41:31.795 --> 41:33.663
We have a warrant for the art.

41:36.110 --> 41:39.486
We are the police,
stay where you are.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.683
Thank you for your cooperation.

42:52.466 --> 42:54.692
What's going on?
Madame Clios...

42:55.528 --> 42:58.698
by order of Interpol,
all the art is seized

42:58.934 --> 43:00.806
and you are to stay
exactly where you are.

43:30.970 --> 43:33.417
Fucking awful night.

43:45.975 --> 43:49.101
What doesn't kill you, et cetera...

43:51.297 --> 43:53.464
Monsieur!
What now?

44:07.587 --> 44:11.081
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

44:11.118 --> 44:14.751
<i>Sparking fires,\
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

44:14.786 --> 44:22.229
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>
