WEBVTT

00:07.656 --> 00:09.391
WHOA.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:09.459 --> 00:11.009
I HAVE TO PUT
A LOAD OF LAUNDRY IN.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.044
NO. NO. WE'RE
IN THE PERFECT POSITION.

00:13.112 --> 00:14.412
I CAN SEE THE TV.
YOU CAN BREATHE.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.881
THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

00:15.948 --> 00:17.515
LOOK, DOUG,
I'LL DO THE WASH,

00:17.583 --> 00:19.684
AND THEN WE'LL GET RIGHT BACK
THE WAY WE WERE, I PROMISE.

00:19.752 --> 00:22.921
YOU'RE-YOU'RE DREAMING.
IT'LL NEVER BE THE SAME.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.856
I HAVE TO DO THIS, OK?

00:24.924 --> 00:26.892
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE
WORK WEEK, AND ONCE AGAIN,

00:26.959 --> 00:31.729
YOUR UNDERPANTS HAVE ME
AGAINST THE ROPES.

00:31.797 --> 00:33.765
AND I APPRECIATE
THE EFFORT,

00:33.832 --> 00:36.034
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M COMFY.

00:38.354 --> 00:39.488
SHH-SHH-
DOUG!

00:39.555 --> 00:41.756
EASY. EASY. EASY.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.192
YOU SEE, THE MORE YOU
STRUGGLE, THE MORE I SQUEEZE.

00:44.259 --> 00:45.293
I'M LIKE AN ANACONDA.

00:45.361 --> 00:47.161
OK! ALL RIGHT! OK!

00:47.229 --> 00:48.262
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

00:48.330 --> 00:49.931
ALL RIGHT.

00:55.404 --> 00:57.205
THAT'S MY HOT POCKET.
IT HAS TO BE ROTATED.

00:57.272 --> 00:59.040
EXCUSE ME.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.013 --> 01:40.615
SERIOUSLY, IS OUR MAILMAN
A BOY OR A GIRL?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.885
BECAUSE I'M LEANING
TOWARDS BOY AGAIN.

01:43.952 --> 01:45.553
YOU KNOW WHAT? I
- I REALLY CAN'T FOCUS ON THAT RIGHT NOW,

01:45.620 --> 01:49.257
'CAUSE I'M STILL SITTING
HERE WITH DRY COCOA PUFFS.

01:49.325 --> 01:50.892
MY DAD'S NOT BACK
WITH THE MILK YET?

01:50.960 --> 01:52.493
THE MARKET'S
3 BLOCKS AWAY,

01:52.561 --> 01:53.661
AND NOW
WE'RE COMING UP ON...

01:53.729 --> 01:56.064
AN HOUR AND A HALF.

01:56.131 --> 01:57.965
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO TRY THE SKIM MILK?

02:02.471 --> 02:05.756
JUST TRYING TO THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

02:05.824 --> 02:07.141
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

02:07.209 --> 02:09.526
I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING COULD'VE HAPPENED TO HIM?

02:12.364 --> 02:14.866
DOUG!
NO, NOTHING HAPPENED.

02:15.884 --> 02:17.502
I'M BACK.

02:17.569 --> 02:18.837
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, WHERE'S THE MILK?

02:18.904 --> 02:20.071
OH, I'VE
GOT SOMETHING

02:20.139 --> 02:22.774
MUCH BETTER
THAN MILK.

02:27.813 --> 02:31.683
A PING-PONG TABLE!

02:31.751 --> 02:32.950
DAD, WHAT HAPPENED?

02:33.018 --> 02:34.952
WELL, I WAS HALFWAY
TO THE MARKET

02:35.020 --> 02:37.789
WHEN I CAME UPON THE
BETCHERS' GARAGE SALE.

02:37.856 --> 02:40.058
LUCKILY, DOUGLAS
HAD GIVEN ME A 50,

02:40.125 --> 02:42.160
AND THIS LITTLE HONEY

02:42.228 --> 02:46.731
WAS CALLING TO ME
LIKE A FRENCH WHORE.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.801
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOLD HIS LEGS,

02:49.868 --> 02:53.338
'CAUSE I'M
GONNA MILK HIM.

02:56.158 --> 02:59.010
OH, HEY, DID YOU HEAR
THAT DENISE GOT PROMOTED

02:59.161 --> 03:00.729
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY?

03:00.796 --> 03:01.463
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

03:01.530 --> 03:02.947
THAT'S GREAT.

03:03.014 --> 03:05.800
YOU KNOW, WITH HER,
UH, MAKING MORE MONEY,

03:05.867 --> 03:08.670
WE CAN FINALLY AFFORD
TO GET A NICE PLACE TOGETHER,

03:08.737 --> 03:10.371
AND I CAN...

03:10.439 --> 03:12.440
FINALLY ASK
THE BIG QUESTION.

03:12.508 --> 03:14.275
WHAT? "CAN I TOUCH 'EM?"

03:15.344 --> 03:18.029
ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GO
SURPRISE HER AT WORK.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.131
SEE YOU LATER
- AND THIS WAS FUN. ALL RIGHT.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.334
I SEE THE TABLE
HAS QUICKLY BECOME

03:23.402 --> 03:26.036
THE RECREATIONAL HUB
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:26.104 --> 03:27.772
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.139
SO...

03:29.207 --> 03:31.409
YOU UP FOR A GAME?

03:31.477 --> 03:33.244
YOU WANT TO PLAY ME?

03:33.312 --> 03:34.812
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.015
OF ALL MINIATURE PADDLE GAMES,

03:37.082 --> 03:39.684
THIS IS MY FORTE.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.519
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

03:41.587 --> 03:43.822
HERE. YOU CAN SERVE.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.911
OK, GRAMPS, ANY WAY WE CAN SPEED
THINGS UP HERE A LITTLE BIT?

04:23.979 --> 04:25.213
ALL RIGHTY.

04:31.136 --> 04:32.620
THAT'S 11-ZIP.

04:32.688 --> 04:34.956
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET THE PADDLE
OFF YOUR SHOULDER THAT GAME.

04:35.023 --> 04:36.607
YOU'RE NOT BETTER
THAN ME, OK?

04:36.675 --> 04:39.043
I JUST KEEP LOSING THE BALL
IN THE WHITE OF YOUR LEGS.

04:39.228 --> 04:40.695
OH, NO. YOU'RE SOFT
FROM PLAYING

04:40.763 --> 04:43.464
IN YOUR COZY, SHAG-CARPETED
REC ROOMS.

04:43.532 --> 04:45.566
I LEARNED PING-PONG
ON THE STREETS!

04:45.634 --> 04:47.735
YOU EITHER GOT GOOD
OR YOU DIED!

04:47.803 --> 04:50.521
JUST SERVE.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.093
WASN'T READY.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.822
OK, FELLAS, THAT'S
2 BUD LIGHTS AND NACHOS,

05:07.889 --> 05:10.758
SO, THAT'S... 9.70.

05:10.826 --> 05:11.892
OUT OF 10.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.895
KEEP IT.

05:13.962 --> 05:16.030
THANKS!

05:17.766 --> 05:20.034
OH, HI!
HEY, SWEETUMS.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.503
UM, IS THIS
THE BIG PROMOTION

05:22.571 --> 05:23.737
YOU WERE
TELLING ME ABOUT?

05:23.805 --> 05:24.972
YOU'RE A COCKTAIL
WAITRESS NOW?

05:25.040 --> 05:26.691
YEAH. IT ALL
HAPPENED SO FAST.

05:26.758 --> 05:29.878
IT DOESN'T EVEN
SEEM REAL TO ME.

05:29.945 --> 05:31.646
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:31.714 --> 05:32.530
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

05:32.598 --> 05:34.915
ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA?

05:34.983 --> 05:36.784
YEAH. WHY NOT?

05:36.852 --> 05:41.723
WELL, I-STRANGE MEN
AND LIQUOR...

05:41.791 --> 05:43.257
QUICK-DRAW
LOTTO MACHINE.

05:43.325 --> 05:46.127
THIS IS A FASTER LIFESTYLE
THAN YOU'RE USED TO.

05:46.194 --> 05:49.063
HONEY, IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO DO THIS,

05:49.131 --> 05:51.833
THEN I WON'T, BUT THE ONLY
REASON I TOOK THIS JOB

05:51.900 --> 05:52.800
WAS SO I COULD
MAKE ENOUGH MONEY

05:52.868 --> 05:55.236
TO START
A REAL LIFE WITH MY...

05:55.303 --> 05:58.239
MIDNIGHT SWORDSMAN.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.393
HEY, SWEETHEART, WHERE
ARE THOSE HOT WINGS?

06:02.461 --> 06:05.763
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:07.132 --> 06:10.568
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
SOME HOT WINGS TO GET.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.038
YEAH. HOW DO YOU LIKE
THAT, OLD MAN?

06:31.106 --> 06:32.190
WHAT? ARE YOU
GETTIN' SCARED?

06:32.257 --> 06:33.724
YOU GETTING SCARED?

06:33.792 --> 06:36.594
UM... I AM.

06:36.661 --> 06:38.029
HEY.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.280
WHAT'S GOING ON, BABY?

06:39.348 --> 06:41.015
IF I COULD JUST
DEVELOP A KILLER SERVE,

06:41.082 --> 06:42.450
HE'LL NEVER HAVE
A CHANCE TO DO HIS SLAM.

06:42.518 --> 06:44.652
THAT'S ALL THE OLD MAN'S
GOT. THAT'S IT!

06:44.719 --> 06:45.503
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT,

06:45.571 --> 06:47.921
MY DAD BEATING YOU
AT PING-PONG?

06:47.989 --> 06:49.257
YEAH.
IT'S VERY ANNOYING.

06:49.324 --> 06:51.359
HOW CAN I BE BEAT BY ANYBODY
WHO EATS SOUP LIKE THIS?

06:54.746 --> 06:56.314
DOUG, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

06:56.382 --> 06:58.649
I MEAN, YOU'RE BIGGER
AND SMARTER

06:58.717 --> 07:01.786
AND LIVE IN THE ABOVEGROUND
PART OF THE HOUSE.

07:01.853 --> 07:04.956
CAN'T YOU JUST LET HIM
HAVE THIS ONE THING?

07:05.024 --> 07:06.641
COME ON, JUST PLAY WITH
ME. PRACTICE. COME ON.

07:10.629 --> 07:11.562
FINE.

07:27.896 --> 07:29.213
CAN WE STOP NOW?

07:29.281 --> 07:30.631
LET'S JUST
FINISH THIS RALLY.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.137
OK.

07:39.124 --> 07:40.792
COME ON!

07:40.859 --> 07:43.127
LOOK ALIVE!

07:43.195 --> 07:44.379
THIS IS REALLY FUN,

07:44.446 --> 07:46.497
BUT I THINK
I SHOULD BE GOING.

07:46.565 --> 07:48.549
ALL RIGHT. WOULD YOU
AL LEAST HIT ONE BACK?

07:48.617 --> 07:50.401
WILL YOU STOP?!

07:50.468 --> 07:53.371
THIS IS JUST LIKE
DODGEBALL ALL OVER AGAIN!

07:56.541 --> 07:58.159
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER?

07:58.510 --> 08:00.461
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S JUST A MESS IN GENERAL.

08:00.629 --> 08:02.913
HEY.
HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER?

08:02.981 --> 08:05.583
YOU HIT THE CAR PRETTY
HARD ON MY LAST SLAM THERE.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.618
IT'S FINE.

08:07.686 --> 08:08.786
WELL, JUST COVER IT UP
BEFORE YOU GO TO WORK.

08:08.938 --> 08:10.738
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO
THINK I SMACK YOU AROUND.

08:13.675 --> 08:16.044
OK.

08:23.902 --> 08:26.003
HELLO, DOUGLAS.
HEY.

08:26.071 --> 08:28.673
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU
"SOFT SERVE"?

08:29.959 --> 08:31.275
YOU SEE THE DOUBLE MEANING?

08:31.343 --> 08:33.378
YOU CLEARLY LOVE
YOUR SOFT ICE CREAM,

08:33.445 --> 08:35.046
AND IN PING-PONG YOUR-

08:35.113 --> 08:38.215
OH, GOD.

08:38.283 --> 08:39.650
I'M SORRY.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.519
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE SO
SENSITIVE ABOUT ME BEATING YOU.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.138
IT'S NOT YOU.

08:44.206 --> 08:45.006
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:45.073 --> 08:46.257
I'M OVER LOSING TO YOU.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.226
YOU? YOU'RE
A FREAK OF NATURE.

08:48.293 --> 08:52.463
YOUR HANDS ARE 5 TIMES
THE SIZE OF A NORMAL MAN'S.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.198
IT'S CARRIE.

08:54.266 --> 08:55.215
OHH.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.019
SO, SHE'S BEEN
CHEATING ON YOU?

08:58.086 --> 09:00.521
IS IT PEDRO?
NO.

09:00.588 --> 09:02.556
SHE'S NOT
CHEATING ON ME.

09:02.624 --> 09:04.424
SHE'S BEATING ME
AT PING-PONG.

09:04.492 --> 09:06.544
OHH.

09:06.611 --> 09:08.779
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T FOLLOW.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.481
IT'S JUST...

09:10.548 --> 09:12.149
I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING
WHEN I MARRIED CARRIE.

09:12.217 --> 09:14.886
SHE'S... IN CHARGE.
SHE RUNS THE SHOW...

09:14.953 --> 09:16.754
AND I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
IT'S JUST...

09:16.821 --> 09:19.673
SPORTS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MY THING, YOU KNOW?

09:19.741 --> 09:22.359
AND NOW THAT SHE CAN BEAT ME AT
A GAME AS STUPID AS PING-PONG,

09:22.427 --> 09:23.895
IT'S LIKE...

09:23.963 --> 09:29.734
LIKE YOU MIGHT AS WELL PULL UP YOUR
TESTICLES LIKE A VENETIAN BLIND?

09:31.286 --> 09:33.421
SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, YEAH.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.309
I MEAN, HOW THE HELL
DID SHE GET SO GOOD, ANYWAY?

09:38.377 --> 09:40.244
HOW DO YOU THINK?
I TAUGHT HER.

09:40.312 --> 09:42.613
THEN TEACH ME.

09:42.681 --> 09:43.798
WHAT?

09:43.866 --> 09:45.916
I WANT YOU TO TRAIN ME...
TO BEAT HER.

09:45.984 --> 09:48.753
I HAVEN'T TRAINED
ANYONE IN YEARS.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.756
COME ON. I NEED YOU.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.992
OK, BUT REMEMBER
THIS, DOUGLAS:

09:55.060 --> 09:56.527
IF I TRAIN YOU,

09:56.595 --> 09:58.596
WE'RE GOING TO BE
DOING THINGS MY WAY.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.733
I KNOW,
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.352
RIGHT.

10:08.306 --> 10:11.959
HERE WE GO.
2 BEERS AND...

10:12.027 --> 10:14.111
ANOTHER VODKA...

10:14.179 --> 10:16.046
FOR "MR. GROPEY."

10:18.283 --> 10:19.984
OK, UM,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

10:20.051 --> 10:22.086
I REALLY DON'T
LIKE YOU WORKING HERE.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.922
SPENCE, I TOLD YOU.
I'M DOING THIS FOR US.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.624
OH, YEAH. THAT'S WHY YOU LEANED
OVER RIGHT IN THOSE GUYS' FACES

10:27.692 --> 10:31.062
AND PUSHED
YOUR PLUMPIES TOGETHER.

10:31.129 --> 10:34.498
IT'S CALLED
"THE LEAN AND SQUEEZE."

10:34.566 --> 10:36.801
IF YOU WERE IN THE INDUSTRY,
YOU'D KNOW THAT.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.803
WAIT. WAIT.
SO, YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.654
IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING?
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:40.722 --> 10:44.007
FAIR ENOUGH, BUT I THINK
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

10:44.075 --> 10:45.008
THAT IF YOU'RE
GOING TO KEEP

10:45.076 --> 10:48.446
LETTING STRANGE MEN
PAW ALL OVER YOU,

10:48.513 --> 10:50.881
I MAY HAVE TO GET
OUT THERE MYSELF.

10:50.949 --> 10:54.668
THERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN LINED
UP TO RIDE SPENCE MOUNTAIN.

10:54.736 --> 10:58.105
WELL, I HOPE THEY ENJOY
A SHORT, BUMPY RIDE.

10:58.172 --> 11:00.057
EXCUSE ME.

11:05.897 --> 11:07.431
COME ON! AT LEAST
PUT SOME WOOD ON IT.

11:07.498 --> 11:09.934
I'M PLAYING WITH A SPOON!

11:10.001 --> 11:10.734
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

11:10.802 --> 11:12.152
IF YOU PRACTICE
WITH A SPOON,

11:12.220 --> 11:15.189
THEN THE PADDLE WILL SEEM
LIKE THE SIZE OF TEXAS.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.125
OK. THAT'S IT.
YOU KNOW, I'M-I'M DONE.

11:18.192 --> 11:19.443
DOUGLAS...

11:19.510 --> 11:22.546
I'M VERY CLOSE TO GIVING
YOU ANOTHER 10 LAPS.

11:22.613 --> 11:25.349
NO, I'M NOT RUNNING AROUND
THE PING-PONG TABLE ANYMORE.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.835
ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.
YOU'RE HYSTERICAL.

11:27.902 --> 11:29.437
LET'S GET BACK
TO BASICS.

11:29.504 --> 11:32.023
JUST SHOW ME
YOUR STROKE.

11:34.927 --> 11:35.993
OK...

11:36.061 --> 11:39.030
THAT WAS
A TRAIN WRECK.

11:39.097 --> 11:40.665
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

11:40.732 --> 11:42.232
COME HERE.

11:44.069 --> 11:46.571
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:46.638 --> 11:49.807
I'M MAKING MYSELF
ONE WITH YOU.

11:49.875 --> 11:54.078
OHHHH.

11:54.145 --> 11:56.814
CAN YOU MAKE YOURSELF
ONE WITHOUT GYRATING?

11:59.618 --> 12:01.986
THAT'S IT.
NICE AND EASY.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.222
LIKE YOU'RE SPANKING
AN UNRULY CHILD.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.642
YOU'RE TOO TENSE.
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.094
RELEASE.

12:11.162 --> 12:12.463
RELEASE INTO ME!

12:12.531 --> 12:16.266
OK, THAT'S IT!
STOP IT! STOP!

12:16.334 --> 12:19.403
NO! NO! YOU WERE
JUST RIGHT THAT TIME.

12:19.471 --> 12:25.175
NOW, PUT DOWN THE SPOON
AND PICK UP THE PADDLE.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.918
WOW. THAT WAS-
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.719
MAYBE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:35.787 --> 12:38.839
YOU BET YOUR BIPPY I DO.

12:38.907 --> 12:42.009
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE A LIGHT MEAL,

12:42.076 --> 12:45.112
LISTEN TO THE TAPES
I MADE YOU,

12:45.180 --> 12:46.830
IN BED BY 9:30,

12:46.898 --> 12:48.783
AND OBVIOUSLY...

12:48.850 --> 12:51.752
NO SHIMMY SHAM.

12:58.776 --> 13:00.311
HEY, BABY.
HI.

13:00.378 --> 13:01.678
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

13:01.746 --> 13:03.147
JUST LISTENING
TO SOME TUNES.

13:06.317 --> 13:12.923
BE THE PADDLE.

13:17.428 --> 13:18.829
IS SOMEONE
GONNA GET THAT?

13:18.897 --> 13:20.330
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.871
HELLO?

13:26.938 --> 13:29.072
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YES, I HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY

13:29.140 --> 13:31.041
WITH MY LONG-DISTANCE
PROVIDER.

13:38.149 --> 13:40.217
HEY, BABY.
HI, HONEY.

13:40.284 --> 13:41.485
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR DINNER?

13:41.553 --> 13:43.287
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE MAIN COURSE,

13:43.322 --> 13:44.388
BUT FOR THE APPETIZER,

13:44.456 --> 13:45.789
ARE YOU UP
FOR A LITTLE...

13:45.857 --> 13:49.660
PING... PONG?

13:49.727 --> 13:54.732
OK, NOT SURE IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT SEX OR THE ACTUAL GAME.

13:54.799 --> 13:55.716
COME ON. PING-PONG.

13:55.783 --> 13:57.868
UH... NAH,
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

13:57.936 --> 13:59.737
JUST ONE GAME
BEFORE DINNER.

13:59.805 --> 14:00.905
NAH.

14:00.972 --> 14:02.539
WHY NOT?

14:02.607 --> 14:05.409
BECAUSE, DOUG, YOU DON'T
LIKE LOSING TO ME, OK?

14:05.477 --> 14:08.245
AND I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BECOME A PROBLEM BETWEEN US.

14:08.313 --> 14:10.530
PROBLEM?

14:10.598 --> 14:11.832
I'M A 38-YEAR-OLD MAN.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.817
I DON'T GET
MY SELF-WORTH

14:12.884 --> 14:14.135
FROM BEATING A GIRL
AT PING-PONG,

14:14.202 --> 14:17.138
NNNKAY?

14:17.205 --> 14:21.525
REALLY? IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
TRAINING WITH MY DAD FOR 2 WEEKS?

14:21.593 --> 14:24.828
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:24.896 --> 14:29.399
DOUG, ALL MY WOODEN
SPOONS ARE GONE.

14:30.218 --> 14:32.503
AND IT WORKED! I CAN
BEAT YOUR ASS NOW!

14:32.570 --> 14:33.504
DOUG...

14:33.571 --> 14:35.189
IF WE GO OUT THERE
AND PLAY,

14:35.256 --> 14:36.457
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA LOSE AGAIN,

14:36.524 --> 14:37.657
AND THEN WHO ARE YOU
GOING TO GET TO TRAIN YOU?

14:37.725 --> 14:39.659
MR. MIYAGI?

14:39.727 --> 14:41.745
MEET ME IN THE GARAGE...

14:41.812 --> 14:43.413
IF YOU GOT THE PLUMS.

14:51.573 --> 14:52.823
YEAH! OH, YEAH!

14:52.891 --> 14:55.609
THAT'S 20 TO 12,
ADVANTAGE DOUG HEFFERNAN.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.913
NOTHING SHORT OF A MASSIVE
STROKE CAN DENY HIM VICTORY.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.365
WELL, THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN
WHEEZING, I LIKE MY CHANCES.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.100
NOW SERVE. LET'S GO.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.351
COMING RIGHT UP.

15:06.188 --> 15:07.555
OH! OH!

15:07.622 --> 15:10.924
OH! OH! OH!

15:10.992 --> 15:12.726
OH-HO HO HO!

15:14.612 --> 15:18.382
OH! OH!

15:18.450 --> 15:19.383
WINNER!

15:19.451 --> 15:21.485
LOSER! OH!

15:26.958 --> 15:28.976
GLAD YOU COULD TAKE ME UP
ON THE INVITATION.

15:29.044 --> 15:32.429
OH, I REALLY NEEDED
A NIGHT LIKE THIS.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.531
OH, UM...

15:37.618 --> 15:39.836
MMM-MMM.

15:42.491 --> 15:44.358
AND HOW ARE YOU FOLKS
THIS EVENING?

15:44.509 --> 15:45.542
UH, WE'RE GOOD,

15:45.610 --> 15:48.545
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
UH... DENISE,

15:48.613 --> 15:50.731
MY LADY FRIEND AND I
ARE IN KIND OF A RUSH,

15:50.798 --> 15:52.016
TRYING TO CATCH A MOVIE.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.801
OH, WELL,
THEN WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

15:54.869 --> 15:55.936
I'LL HAVE
A HEINEKEN ON TAP,

15:56.004 --> 15:58.105
AND, HOLLY,

15:58.173 --> 15:59.907
I PEG YOU AS
A BRANDY AND SODA GIRL,

15:59.975 --> 16:00.908
AM I RIGHT?

16:00.976 --> 16:03.143
WELL, YES,
BUT NO SODA

16:03.211 --> 16:04.811
AND MAKE THAT
BRANDY GIN.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.614
YOU'RE DELIGHTFUL.

16:07.682 --> 16:10.084
OK, BE BACK IN A JIFF.

16:10.151 --> 16:11.635
HMM.

16:14.439 --> 16:15.639
VODKA ON THE ROCKS.

16:15.707 --> 16:17.074
THANKS.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.309
YOU KNOW, IT'S, UM...

16:18.376 --> 16:19.676
SO WARM IN HERE TONIGHT.

16:19.744 --> 16:21.345
UM, DO YOU MIND?

16:21.412 --> 16:23.747
HUH?

16:23.815 --> 16:25.549
OH, YEAH!

16:25.616 --> 16:26.834
OOH!

16:26.901 --> 16:28.986
OH, THAT'S
SO MUCH BETTER.

16:29.054 --> 16:30.654
OOH!

16:31.740 --> 16:33.357
THANKS.

17:07.842 --> 17:09.442
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:09.510 --> 17:11.528
WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU'RE
OVER THERE WITH BLONDIE!

17:22.339 --> 17:24.140
UH, SPENCE,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

17:25.694 --> 17:27.676
HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.730
IS THAT TRUE?

17:29.798 --> 17:31.532
PRETTY MUCH.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.233
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST BEING NICE TO ME

17:33.301 --> 17:35.202
TO TRY TO
GET IN MY PANTS.

17:35.269 --> 17:37.237
WELL,
GOOD NIGHT TO YOU!

17:48.916 --> 17:50.868
YEAH!

17:50.935 --> 17:52.119
ONCE AGAIN...

17:52.270 --> 17:53.737
VERY CUTE.

17:53.804 --> 17:54.805
AND, YOU KNOW, TO CELEBRATE MY VICTORY,

17:54.872 --> 17:56.590
I'VE DECREED
A NIGHT OF SEX...

17:56.658 --> 17:59.793
<i>AND GEORGE FOREMAN
ON BIOGRAPHY.</i>

17:59.861 --> 18:01.395
WELL, LET ME KNOW
HOW THAT TURNS OUT.

18:01.462 --> 18:03.063
OH.

18:03.131 --> 18:04.732
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
DOESN'T LIKE LOSING SO MUCH.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.617
I'M FINE WITH IT,
BUT JUST DO ME A FAVOR

18:06.684 --> 18:09.953
AND BACK DOWN THE OBNOXIOUS
THING A SCOOCH, OK?

18:10.021 --> 18:14.491
BUT I HAVE SO MUCH
TO BE OBNOXIOUS ABOUT.

18:14.559 --> 18:16.710
NOT REALLY.

18:16.778 --> 18:18.679
WHAT?
NOTHING.

18:18.746 --> 18:20.214
YOU SAID, "NOT REALLY."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:20.282 --> 18:21.682
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

18:21.749 --> 18:22.883
IT'S GOTTA MEAN
SOMETHING.

18:22.950 --> 18:24.935
ALL RIGHT. IT MEANS
I LET YOU WIN, OK?

18:26.187 --> 18:29.189
YOU LET ME WIN?

18:29.257 --> 18:31.224
WOW!

18:31.292 --> 18:35.912
I JUST BEAT YOU LIKE
A GRAND CANYON MULE,

18:35.980 --> 18:37.781
AND YOU CAN'T
GIVE ME MY PROPS.

18:37.849 --> 18:39.450
VERY SAD.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.300
OK, DOUG,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

18:40.368 --> 18:42.953
YOU BEAT ME.

18:43.021 --> 18:45.822
I DID.

18:45.890 --> 18:49.226
YOU DID.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.595
I WHIPPED YOUR BUTT.

18:51.662 --> 18:52.896
AND I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.

18:52.964 --> 18:53.847
I KNOW YOU'RE AGREEING
WITH ME. I'M JUST TALKING.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.232
I'M ALLOWED TO TALK
IN MY OWN HOUSE, OK?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.384
YES, YOU ARE.
I KNOW I AM. THANK YOU.

18:59.954 --> 19:02.272
ONE MORE GAME.
RIGHT NOW.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.278
OK, 21 TO 3.
THAT WAS DECISIVE.

19:08.346 --> 19:10.347
I BEGGED YOU
NOT TO DO THIS.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.232
I JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS. I MEAN...

19:12.300 --> 19:14.501
I- I TRAINED FOR 2 WEEKS.
I CALLED IN SICK TWICE.

19:14.569 --> 19:16.036
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

19:16.104 --> 19:17.804
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SO IT'S OVER NOW.

19:17.872 --> 19:19.840
CAN WE
JUST GET PAST IT?

19:19.907 --> 19:20.924
I DID HAVE THAT ONE SLAM.
YOU ALMOST DIDN'T RETURN THAT-

19:20.991 --> 19:22.576
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
YOUR GAME HAS IMPROVED.

19:22.644 --> 19:24.027
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT HAS.

19:24.095 --> 19:28.014
NOW, I BELIEVE THAT YOU
DECREED A NIGHT OF...

19:28.083 --> 19:31.385
SEX AND, UM, SOMETHING
ABOUT GEORGE FOREMAN.

19:31.453 --> 19:33.270
THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT
I WAS CHAMPION.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.840
WELL, I'M THE CHAMPION
NOW, SO I DECREE IT.

19:53.441 --> 19:55.392
CAN-CAN I DO
SOMETHING HERE?

19:55.459 --> 19:57.127
WHAT?

19:57.195 --> 19:58.795
I MEAN, YOU'RE DOMINATING EVERYTHING!

19:58.863 --> 20:00.530
GOSH, FIRST IT'S
PING-PONG, NOW IT'S SEX.

20:00.598 --> 20:04.134
IT'S OFFICIAL!
I AM THE WOMAN!

20:04.202 --> 20:05.869
WILL YOU STOP IT?

20:05.937 --> 20:07.570
I CAN'T, OK?!

20:07.638 --> 20:09.823
WHY IS THIS
SUCH A BIG DEAL TO YOU?

20:09.890 --> 20:10.957
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S
A BIG DEAL, BUT IT IS,

20:11.025 --> 20:13.092
AND IT'S GONNA
RUIN EVERYTHING!

20:13.160 --> 20:14.845
OK-OH, ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:14.913 --> 20:18.949
SOME MARRIAGES, THEY BREAK UP
OVER MONEY, OR SOMEONE CHEATS.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.985
I MEAN, IS OUR THING
REALLY GOING TO BE PING-PONG?

20:22.053 --> 20:23.537
LOOKS THAT WAY.

20:23.605 --> 20:24.771
OH, OK.

20:24.839 --> 20:25.723
WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S A GOOD REASON.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.991
THAT'LL BE FUN
CALLING YOUR FOLKS.

20:28.059 --> 20:28.842
BELIEVE ME,
THEY'D UNDERSTAND.

20:28.909 --> 20:29.927
THEY ALMOST
GOT DIVORCED

20:29.994 --> 20:32.295
<i>OVER A QUESTION
ON CARD SHARKS.</i>

20:32.363 --> 20:33.830
NOW, COME ON.

20:33.898 --> 20:36.533
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO HERE.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.685
<i>THERE IS. I HAVE TO BEAT
YOU AT PING-PONG FOR REAL.</i>

20:38.753 --> 20:41.555
AND I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

20:41.622 --> 20:45.292
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN.

20:45.359 --> 20:47.394
RIGHT.

20:47.462 --> 20:49.446
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE?

21:03.477 --> 21:06.413
YEAH! WHOO!
WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!

21:07.849 --> 21:10.150
IT'S 12-9.
