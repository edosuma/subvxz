<i>Let's call American Express.</i>
<i>You lost your card,</i>

00:25.858 --> 00:27.917
<i> and you don't know</i>
<i>what the number of it is.</i>

00:28.027 --> 00:29.007
<i>That's a great one.</i>

00:29.228 --> 00:30.217
<i>Do the old lady.</i>

00:30.329 --> 00:32.524
<i>I lost my card.</i>

00:33.733 --> 00:35.598
<i>Your... Your accent went in</i>
<i>and out on you sometimes.</i>

00:35.701 --> 00:36.963
<i>I went</i>
<i>southern and then...</i>

00:37.069 --> 00:38.536
<i>American Express.</i>
<i>I'm Danille, how may I help you?</i>

00:38.638 --> 00:40.833
<i>I certainly need some assistance.</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:44.239
<i>I'm sorry to call you</i>
<i>in such a frenzy,</i>

00:44.343 --> 00:48.473
but I'm very shook up.
I got my American Express card stolen.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.283
<i>Okay, can I have</i>
<i>your last name, please?</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:52.351
Yes.

00:52.985 --> 00:54.145
<i>What's your last name?</i>

00:54.253 --> 00:55.345
Right.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.219
<i>Okay, can you give me your name
so I can look up your account?</i>

00:58.324 --> 00:59.348
Yes. Helen.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.790
<i>What's your</i>
<i>last name, please?</i>

01:00.893 --> 01:02.087
Easafawn.

01:03.095 --> 01:04.062
<i>What?</i>

01:05.230 --> 01:08.029
Helen Easafawn.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.694
E-A

01:11.938 --> 01:16.068
S-A-fawn.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.373
<i>Jerry's Famous Deli.</i>
<i>This is Cindy. May I help you?</i>

01:19.479 --> 01:23.074
Hi. I have no legs.
May I speak to the manager?

01:26.819 --> 01:31.688
Now, if I get a bill and
it's something, like, for...

01:37.396 --> 01:41.765
But two times in a row I eat
the damn roast beef and I'm...

01:42.835 --> 01:46.396
I can't stop going to the bathroom!

01:46.506 --> 01:49.168
<i>Well, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but there's nothing I can do for you.</i>

01:49.275 --> 01:50.503
Ma?

01:51.277 --> 01:53.438
And my son thinks I'm crazy.

01:53.546 --> 01:54.945
Ma, who you calling?

01:55.047 --> 01:57.174
It's Jerry's.
And don't tell me not to call them.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.342
Jesus Christ, get off
the fucking phone!

01:59.452 --> 02:00.419
Don't talk to me that way!

02:00.520 --> 02:02.420
Get off the fucking phone!

02:02.522 --> 02:03.489
What's going on?

02:03.589 --> 02:04.851
<i>Same thing as the last time.</i>

02:04.957 --> 02:06.219
Did she...
What'd she call you about?

02:06.325 --> 02:07.485
The roast beef?
<i>- Yes.</i>

02:07.593 --> 02:09.561
All right, she just
puked in the kitchen.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.028
<i>That's all right. I suggested
that she doesn't eat roast beef</i>

02:12.131 --> 02:14.031
<i>if it doesn't</i>
<i>agree with her.</i>

02:17.003 --> 02:23.408
I... I appreciate your suggestions,
but I love roast beef.

02:23.509 --> 02:24.999
It's delicious!

02:25.745 --> 02:27.178
Go clean up the mess!

02:27.280 --> 02:30.511
I can't. Get off of me!

02:30.950 --> 02:32.417
You son of a bitch!

03:18.197 --> 03:19.186
George?

03:25.938 --> 03:27.132
Hi, Mr. Simmons.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.501
Ladies.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.002
George Simmons, man!
Can I get a picture?

03:33.412 --> 03:35.937
Yeah, yeah. You got it ready?
All right, hit me, baby, all right.

03:36.048 --> 03:37.879
Get a little tittie in there.
Come on.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.415
How are you?
You're really funny.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.042
Thank you. You're funnier.

03:43.823 --> 03:44.949
Hello.
- Hi!

03:45.057 --> 03:46.581
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Hey, what's up?

03:46.692 --> 03:48.159
Hey.
How are you?

04:02.174 --> 04:03.664
Hey, handsome.
- Doctor.

04:03.776 --> 04:04.743
How are you, kid?

04:04.844 --> 04:05.811
How are you, baby?

04:07.613 --> 04:09.137
The Lunestas are working, baby.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.546
Those are smooth. No hangover.

04:11.651 --> 04:16.281
Fall asleep, bam. Fucking what
was the deal with the Restorils?

04:16.389 --> 04:19.983
Why did you give me those?
You trying to fuck with me or something?

04:20.091 --> 04:23.755
George, we got the results back from
the follow-up of your blood count

04:23.863 --> 04:26.457
and it's not what we hoped for.

04:26.565 --> 04:30.194
As I mentioned earlier,
the CBC was abnormal.

04:30.302 --> 04:35.103
Your white blood cells were four
times the size that they should be.

04:35.207 --> 04:38.973
And very low hemoglobin,
seven grams per deciliter.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.137
I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.738
Can you speak
how people speak?

04:44.350 --> 04:47.251
You have a very serious disease.
It's called AML.

04:47.353 --> 04:52.052
It's a form of leukemia and I can't
predict how this will play out,

04:52.158 --> 04:55.753
but I feel you have
a rough road ahead of you.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.328
That's George Simmons,
right here.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.733
George! George!
George Simmons!

05:04.837 --> 05:07.237
Hey, man! How, how you
doing, man? I'm a big fan of yours.

05:27.193 --> 05:31.459
I'm sorry to say we're past the
point where traditional structures

05:31.564 --> 05:35.227
like chemotherapy and radiation
would be effective at all.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.929
<i>And I think it's best for
us to pursue an experimental course.</i>

05:45.411 --> 05:46.810
Here you go, ma'am.
Your tamales.

05:46.912 --> 05:48.311
Thanks for shopping at Otto's.
- Yo, Chuck,

05:48.981 --> 05:51.040
I'm going up at the Comedy
& Magic Club doing stand-up.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.344
You should come watch me.

05:52.451 --> 05:54.919
Don't let him suck you in.
He's not funny.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.619
Nah, he's right, man. No way,
man. That shit was painful.

05:57.723 --> 05:59.714
I mean, it was hard
watching you suffer up there.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.452
I had fucking
nightmares after that.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.027
That was a long time ago.
That was months ago.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.289
I've gotten a lot
funnier since then.

06:04.396 --> 06:05.522
Then you bored
my wife to sleep.

06:05.631 --> 06:06.962
I couldn't get no
pussy that night, man.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.557
Don't blame me
for your pussy issues.

06:09.668 --> 06:11.158
Are they gonna pay you?
- Pay me? No!

06:11.270 --> 06:13.170
That's just how it starts.
You don't get paid in the beginning.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.365
You gotta, you know, work
your way up through the ranks.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.338
My nigger, how the fuck
you in show business

06:17.443 --> 06:18.842
when you got no
business to show?

06:18.944 --> 06:20.206
I'm supposed
to be writing jokes.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.506
I'm supposed
to be doing comedy.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.775
I'm not supposed to be
making macaroni salad.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.579
I hate it, man. It's depressing.
Otto's sucks!

06:26.685 --> 06:28.778
You don't know about no
motherfucking hard time, man.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.085
I'm a ex-convict, man. Otto's the
only place that would hire me.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.283
You too good
for Otto's now?

06:33.392 --> 06:34.381
I'm not too good for it.

06:34.493 --> 06:35.653
I just don't...
It's not for me, you know, I'm sorry.

06:35.761 --> 06:36.750
See that bridge?
1,200 bucks.

06:38.810 --> 06:39.799
Okay.

06:39.911 --> 06:42.607
On the house, man!
Otto, man! Otto's my lotto.

06:42.714 --> 06:45.239
Come on, man, look.
I can't work here anymore, all right?

06:45.350 --> 06:47.045
What, you gonna be on TV
or some shit like that?

06:47.152 --> 06:49.017
I am gonna be on TV.
The chunky guy on <i>Survivor</i> or some shit?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.553
No, I'm gonna
be like Seinfeld.

06:50.655 --> 06:52.384
Get the fuck
out of here, man!

06:52.824 --> 06:53.791
You ain't gonna be like Seinfeld.

06:53.892 --> 06:55.860
Seinfeld's my motherfucking man!

06:55.960 --> 06:57.257
Now Kramer,

06:57.362 --> 07:00.058
Kramer gets a pass from me
'cause Kramer's my nigger.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.190
Well, very forgiving of you.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.427
Look, as a friend, man,
let me tell you something.

07:04.536 --> 07:06.003
You're not funny.
- I think I'm funny.

07:06.104 --> 07:08.231
I got new jokes, man,
and they're good.

07:08.339 --> 07:09.499
Let me hear one
of your new jokes.

07:09.607 --> 07:11.632
Okay, I got one like,

07:11.743 --> 07:14.211
I'm really good at <i>Guitar Hero,</i>
you know, on PlayStation,

07:14.312 --> 07:17.008
and I was so good at it, I thought,
like, "Maybe I should get a guitar."

07:17.115 --> 07:19.015
Then I thought like, "I'm really
good at <i>Grand Theft Auto,</i>

07:19.117 --> 07:20.982
"maybe I should start
beating up hookers."

07:21.753 --> 07:23.345
Okay, that got me.
That was humorous.

07:23.454 --> 07:24.751
I thought you'd like that.

07:24.856 --> 07:26.221
But, yo, I ain't got no dough, man.

07:26.324 --> 07:27.655
For real, if I had
some dough, I would go.

07:27.759 --> 07:28.726
I'll pay your cover charge.

07:28.827 --> 07:29.953
That's the night
I take my wife out also,

07:30.061 --> 07:31.050
so you gotta pay
for my bitch, too.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.943
Okay, I'll do it. Okay.
- If you come and laugh. Laugh loud.

07:36.154 --> 07:37.178
Like that?
- That's good. Perfect.

07:37.288 --> 07:38.255
I'll see you Saturday then.

07:38.356 --> 07:39.345
Okay, good.
Thank you.

07:39.457 --> 07:41.687
<i>Craig, listen to me.</i>
<i>I'm doing the best I can, okay?</i>

07:41.793 --> 07:46.355
<i>I wiped your ass our entire childhood.</i>
<i>Now it's your turn, buddy!</i>

07:46.464 --> 07:48.659
<i>Well, you're the one that asked
the wizard to make you young again.</i>

07:48.766 --> 07:50.097
<i>I didn't mean this young!</i>

07:51.769 --> 07:53.532
<i>Last time I had a suit on,</i>
<i>at my bar mitzvah.</i>

07:53.638 --> 07:55.333
<i>My bar mitzvah,</i>
<i>it was the last...</i>

07:55.439 --> 07:57.066
<i>And now I got the same suit.</i>
<i>It's the same suit.</i>

07:57.175 --> 08:00.508
<i>I think it looks good. The bar mitzvah
was a good day in my life.</i>

08:00.611 --> 08:02.977
<i>I made more money that day than
I think I'll ever make again.</i>

08:04.148 --> 08:07.276
<i>You know, it's really sad.</i>
<i>To peak at 13 is a weird feeling.</i>

08:07.385 --> 08:08.352
<i>This is indicative</i>
<i>of the kind of...</i>

08:08.452 --> 08:10.010
<i>Yo. Yo. Shoot that.</i>
<i>Look at that!</i>

08:10.121 --> 08:13.352
<i>Both those girls just go,</i>
<i>"That's the guy from MTV."</i>

08:13.457 --> 08:16.017
<i>I swear on my life, those two girls,
they were just going,</i>

08:16.127 --> 08:18.561
<i>"That's the guy."</i>
<i>It's the second time it happened.</i>

08:18.663 --> 08:22.963
<i>I got off a... I got off,</i>
<i>I got off the bus, and...</i>

08:23.067 --> 08:24.967
<i>I mean, the train.</i>
<i>I'm walking out...</i>

08:59.604 --> 09:03.904
<i>Me and Ann traded shifts.</i>
<i>My family's in from Green Bay.</i>

09:04.008 --> 09:06.943
<i>You know, come to see how their
daughter's doing in the big city.</i>

09:07.044 --> 09:09.137
<i>You know, wait,</i>
<i>you went to school here, right?</i>

09:11.515 --> 09:12.482
<i>Hello?</i>

09:12.583 --> 09:15.780
Hey, Laura, it's George.

09:15.887 --> 09:19.550
How's the northern side
of California going?

09:20.424 --> 09:22.119
<i>What do you</i>
<i>want, George?</i>

09:22.894 --> 09:24.862
I was wondering if
you had a few minutes.

09:24.962 --> 09:27.954
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

09:28.432 --> 09:32.892
Actually, I don't.
I was just walking out the door.

09:33.004 --> 09:36.098
Is it okay if I get your number
and I'll give you a call back later?

09:36.807 --> 09:38.775
<i>I know I'm not</i>
<i>supposed to call you.</i>

09:38.876 --> 09:41.344
I just wanted
to let you know that,

09:42.914 --> 09:46.179
that I really am so
sorry about everything.

09:48.319 --> 09:50.310
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

09:52.356 --> 09:54.256
<i>Too bad you didn't realize
that back then, but</i>

09:54.358 --> 09:57.623
anyway, I gotta go.
Do you want me to call you back?

09:58.663 --> 10:01.530
<i>No, you don't have to call me back.</i>
<i>I know you're not going to,</i>

10:01.699 --> 10:05.032
but I just wanted to let you
know I was sorry one more time.

10:05.136 --> 10:08.037
<i>Okay. Well, all right.</i>
<i>Okay, good luck, George.</i>

10:08.139 --> 10:09.197
Okay.

10:15.570 --> 10:18.937
You know, so, like, I have this joke
about how, like, you never see, like,

10:19.040 --> 10:22.532
a very attractive, blonde,
big-breasted homeless woman.

10:22.644 --> 10:26.136
You know, like, someone will take
care of that person no matter what.

10:26.248 --> 10:28.113
That woman's gonna be fine.
All right, so here's the joke.

10:28.216 --> 10:30.582
You can be attractive and
stupid and make it in the world.

10:30.685 --> 10:31.652
Yeah.

10:31.753 --> 10:32.913
And you could be
unattractive and smart

10:33.021 --> 10:34.181
and make it in the world.
- Yeah.

10:34.289 --> 10:37.554
But it's the ugly, dumb
people who are really screwed

10:37.659 --> 10:39.320
'cause they're ignorant
and an eyesore.

10:39.427 --> 10:40.394
That's funny, man.

10:40.495 --> 10:41.894
That's pretty funny.
I think that'll work.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.259
I was thinking of doing
this thing where, like,

10:43.365 --> 10:44.889
I'm not good-looking
and I'm not bad-looking.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.399
I'm kind of, like, right
in the middle, you know.

10:46.501 --> 10:50.096
Like... Like, if I had a good personality,
I could get any chick in the world,

10:50.205 --> 10:52.105
but I don't.
- Yeah, it doesn't work.

10:52.207 --> 10:54.038
I auditioned for Budd
Friedman at the lmprov.

10:54.142 --> 10:55.131
He okayed me
and made me a regular.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.023
Budd won't even
look me in the eye.

10:58.133 --> 11:01.125
Man, that's...
Good for you, man. Congratulations.

11:01.236 --> 11:03.101
You shouldn't have lost
all that weight, man.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.763
There's nothing funny
about a physically-fit man.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.670
I know. It's lame, right?
- Yeah.

11:06.775 --> 11:08.675
No one wants to watch
Lance Armstrong do comedy.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.005
Oh, God.

11:10.112 --> 11:11.272
Hey, Ira.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.543
Oh, hey, Mark. Can you do me a
favor and never leave a paycheck

11:14.650 --> 11:17.118
from your shit sitcom on my
pillow ever again, please?

11:17.219 --> 11:20.347
That is so rude of me
to accidentally leave my paycheck

11:20.455 --> 11:24.152
for $25,000 on your pillow.
I'm sorry.

11:24.259 --> 11:25.226
It's a dick move.

11:25.327 --> 11:26.692
It's just,
they keep coming,

11:26.795 --> 11:27.989
you know,
week after week.

11:28.096 --> 11:30.121
It's getting a little bit hard
to keep track of them all.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.756
You know what?
Becoming marginally famous

11:31.867 --> 11:33.459
has really turned
you into an asshole.

11:33.569 --> 11:37.699
Now listen, I'd love to stay here and
chat with you, but we have company.

11:37.806 --> 11:39.967
You know that girl comedian
who lives across the street?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.702
The one with the dark hair
and the bangs?

11:41.810 --> 11:42.868
Daisy, yeah.
Daisy, right.

11:42.978 --> 11:46.175
Well, I bumped into her
outside and I invited her in,

11:46.281 --> 11:48.841
and she's sitting in our
living room right now.

11:48.951 --> 11:50.248
She's out there
right now?

11:50.352 --> 11:53.185
She's hot and she's mousy,
but kind of like...

11:53.288 --> 11:55.620
She's mousy like a mouse you
want to stick your dick in.

11:55.724 --> 11:57.624
Yeah, you've gotta get
out there and talk to her.

11:57.726 --> 11:58.693
Why would you do that?

11:58.794 --> 12:00.125
What do you mean,
why would I do that?

12:00.229 --> 12:01.196
I'm trying to hook you up.

12:01.296 --> 12:02.456
Well, I'm laying
groundwork, man.

12:02.564 --> 12:04.498
I got a three-month plan.
You can't just throw me into this.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.727
I'll give you 10 days
on your three-month plan.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.393
No, I need 80
more days than that!

12:08.503 --> 12:12.530
Okay, I do this because I care
about you. I do this to motivate you.

12:12.641 --> 12:16.509
But I will fuck that girl
in 10 days. I promise.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.273
Come on, dude,
I'm not cute like you.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.679
I don't look like Jackson Browne.
I look like Jon Favreau!

12:21.783 --> 12:24.251
Don't do this to me.
Don't make me fuck her.

12:24.353 --> 12:25.615
Well, then just
don't fuck her!

12:25.721 --> 12:28.053
Don't you put me in this corner
where I have to fuck my way out.

12:28.156 --> 12:31.057
He'll do it, too. He'll do it.
I've seen him do this before.

12:31.159 --> 12:34.151
I'm gonna go out there and warm
her up. I'll see you out there.

12:34.496 --> 12:35.861
<i>Kanye.</i>
<i>Kanye!</i>

12:35.964 --> 12:37.022
<i>No. T.I.</i>
<i>T.I.</i>

12:37.132 --> 12:38.565
<i>Lil Weezy.</i>
<i>It's all about Common.</i>

12:38.667 --> 12:40.191
<i>Eminem.</i>
<i>- But do you guys know</i>

12:40.302 --> 12:42.532
<i>who the greatest</i>
<i>rapper of all time is?</i>

12:43.038 --> 12:46.599
<i> William Shakespeare!</i>

12:47.876 --> 12:51.175
I know it's silly, but it's fun.
You know, people like it.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.440
Yeah.
- You know?

12:52.547 --> 12:55.015
It's just cool that
you're on TV. I mean...

12:55.117 --> 12:57.017
I can't believe you
haven't seen this before.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.521
Yeah, I can't believe
it's gotten by me.

13:00.622 --> 13:04.456
Is it on a kids channel? WB?
A teen channel or something?

13:04.559 --> 13:05.526
No. It's on NBC.

13:05.627 --> 13:06.594
Really?

13:06.695 --> 13:08.492
Ira, this is Daisy.
- Oh!

13:08.597 --> 13:09.825
Daisy, Ira.
- Hi.

13:09.931 --> 13:10.955
How are you? How's it going?
- Good.

13:11.066 --> 13:12.090
Actually, I have a cold,
so I shouldn't...

13:12.200 --> 13:13.189
Oh!

13:13.702 --> 13:14.669
Air shake.

13:16.438 --> 13:18.872
I've actually seen you do comedy
at the lmprov a couple times.

13:18.974 --> 13:20.874
Yeah, you're really...
You're really, really funny.

13:20.976 --> 13:22.637
Oh, thanks.

13:23.445 --> 13:25.174
You know, Ira
just lost 20 pounds.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.009
Oh, congratulations.

13:27.115 --> 13:29.083
Yes, I did.
All from my cock.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.414
Um... So...

13:32.354 --> 13:36.290
So, this episode right here
is actually a two-parter.

13:36.391 --> 13:39.451
Great, so does that mean we're
gonna watch both parts right now?

13:39.561 --> 13:41.324
Oh, shoot. Oh, God.

13:41.430 --> 13:42.727
You need some help
with that, Ira?

13:42.831 --> 13:44.093
No! No, it's...

13:44.199 --> 13:46.326
It's okay, I got it.
I got it. I got it.

13:46.802 --> 13:47.860
Mmm.

13:51.073 --> 13:53.769
I'm joking.
I'll get a rag.

13:54.142 --> 13:56.007
See you in nine days, Ira!

13:57.212 --> 13:58.506
<i>I went to a place recently</i>

13:58.613 --> 14:01.514
<i>I'm convinced is the most</i>
<i>fucked up, crazy place</i>

14:01.616 --> 14:07.077
<i>I've ever been to. It's a little
place called Cold Stone Creamery.</i>

14:07.189 --> 14:08.656
<i>Now, the thing</i>
<i>at Cold Stone is...</i>

14:08.757 --> 14:11.282
I can't believe this
is what people like.

14:11.393 --> 14:17.923
<i>The sizes are "like it,"
"love it" and "gotta have it!"</i>

14:18.300 --> 14:21.167
<i>What kind of crackhead</i>
<i>terminology is that?</i>

14:21.269 --> 14:22.327
<i>"What size you want, man?"</i>

14:22.437 --> 14:24.405
<i>" I don't know, man,</i>
<i>I just gotta have it!</i>

14:24.506 --> 14:26.838
<i>" Put some ice cream in a cup</i>
<i>with some sprinkles!</i>

14:26.942 --> 14:29.672
<i>" Put your dick in a Butterfinger</i>
<i>and fuck it for me, please!</i>

14:29.778 --> 14:33.179
<i>" Put it in the cup! I need it!</i>
<i>I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!</i>

14:33.281 --> 14:35.875
<i>" I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!</i>
<i>I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!</i>

14:35.984 --> 14:37.975
<i>" I'm tweaking!</i>
<i>I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!"</i>

14:38.086 --> 14:41.078
<i>That's how it's done, son!</i>
<i>That's how it's done, son!</i>

14:41.990 --> 14:43.753
Killed it, man.
Crowd was crazy.

14:43.859 --> 14:45.759
Is it always that wild
on a Wednesday?

14:45.861 --> 14:47.488
No, they were...
They seem pretty good out there.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.563
I'm really stepping up my game.

14:48.663 --> 14:51.291
These bitches gotta
start paying me for this.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.801
Can't get no more free Randy.
I just fucked that crowd in the ass.

14:54.903 --> 14:55.870
Yeah.

14:55.971 --> 14:57.939
Just awesome.
Just fucking bam!

14:58.039 --> 15:02.237
Crowd, me, bam! Crowd, me...
My stand-up's my dick.

15:04.179 --> 15:06.204
You know?
I'm gonna do the same thing.

15:07.149 --> 15:09.947
Bullshit! Let's get some
M&M's and chips going.

15:10.051 --> 15:11.040
Yellow!
- Ira!

15:12.558 --> 15:14.651
Hey. Kevin Rooney didn't show up,

15:14.761 --> 15:16.160
so you're gonna do
10 minutes after Leo.

15:16.863 --> 15:18.490
Really? Okay.
Thanks. Yeah.

15:18.598 --> 15:20.498
"Yeah,
thanks, yeah."

15:27.774 --> 15:30.402
Hey.
Did he just tell you you're going on next?

15:30.510 --> 15:32.410
Yeah, I'm on next.
Okay. Well, I'm on after you,

15:32.512 --> 15:34.810
and if you go long, this is
going to die in my pocket.

15:36.015 --> 15:38.483
That wasn't a joke.
I'm not a comic.

15:38.751 --> 15:41.083
Okay, when you get the light
that means one minute.

15:41.187 --> 15:42.154
Okay.

15:42.455 --> 15:44.514
<i>The other night, I heard my
balls and my dick talking.</i>

15:44.624 --> 15:45.613
<i>And my balls were like,</i>

15:47.477 --> 15:48.637
<i>"Are you okay?</i>

15:51.714 --> 15:53.204
<i>"Is he hurting you?"</i>

15:53.983 --> 15:56.008
<i>And my dick's like,</i>
<i>"You don't know him like I do.</i>

15:56.119 --> 15:58.280
<i>" He's a great guy.</i>
<i>He loves me. "</i>

15:59.756 --> 16:01.280
<i>There's always one guy that</i>
<i>laughs way too hard in the...</i>

16:01.391 --> 16:03.018
Hey. George Simmons
just showed up.

16:03.126 --> 16:05.253
He wants to go on,
so you are bumped.

16:05.395 --> 16:06.862
Okay, how long does he do?

16:06.963 --> 16:07.952
How the fuck should I know?

16:08.064 --> 16:09.656
He hasn't been here in five years,
but you gotta be ready.

16:09.766 --> 16:10.755
Okay.
Okay.

16:10.867 --> 16:13.165
<i>Thank you, guys!</i>
<i>It's really nice to be here!</i>

16:14.838 --> 16:16.533
See that? I fucking killed out there.
- Yeah, that was good.

16:16.639 --> 16:17.901
Watch out, Leo, watch out.
All my new shit worked.

16:18.007 --> 16:18.996
Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.804
I was supposed to go on after you.
George Simmons showed up.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.241
Now I'm gonna go on after him.

16:22.345 --> 16:23.869
George Simmons is going up right now?
- Yeah.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.277
I just opened for George Simmons?

16:25.381 --> 16:26.609
Yeah.

16:26.716 --> 16:28.183
That's fucking awesome, man!

16:29.819 --> 16:31.616
<i>Yeah!</i>

16:32.255 --> 16:34.450
<i>All right!</i>

16:36.359 --> 16:38.327
<i>Yeah, all right,</i>
<i>I'm scared.</i>

16:38.428 --> 16:40.692
<i>I'm scared</i>
<i>for all of you guys.</i>

16:40.797 --> 16:44.733
<i>You need me! You need me.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna be here forever.</i>

16:45.568 --> 16:49.629
<i>Who's gonna amuse you?</i>
<i>It's so simple.</i>

16:49.739 --> 16:50.899
<i>You just look at
each other and say...</i>

16:53.009 --> 16:53.998
<i>Everyone's laughing.</i>

16:55.737 --> 17:00.470
<i>You people are so unamusing</i>
<i>you have to pay another person</i>

17:00.575 --> 17:03.908
<i>to come and amuse you.</i>
<i>What do you do at home?</i>

17:04.012 --> 17:05.912
<i>Just sit, fucking antsy,</i>
<i>all day long,</i>

17:06.013 --> 17:08.505
<i>" When are we gonna get</i>
<i>to that amusement place?</i>

17:08.617 --> 17:11.915
<i>"Amuse me." You should be
thanking me for those movies.</i>

17:12.186 --> 17:14.280
<i>" Oh! Finally, a movie.</i>
<i>Let's watch it together. "</i>

17:14.388 --> 17:15.946
<i>That's the beauty</i>
<i>of movies, by the way.</i>

17:16.058 --> 17:17.820
<i>You go in there and you don't
have to talk to each other.</i>

17:17.925 --> 17:19.757
<i>And it's fun.</i>
<i>You could stare at the screen.</i>

17:20.162 --> 17:23.723
<i>And, " Maybe we don't hate each
other 'cause we both like this movie.</i>

17:24.933 --> 17:27.527
<i>" We are connecting on that.</i>

17:28.069 --> 17:30.766
<i>" Hey, we're still together.</i>

17:30.872 --> 17:33.841
<i>"All these years later,</i>
<i>we still love each other, right?</i>

17:33.942 --> 17:37.503
<i>" During the movie, yes. When the
movie's over, 'You fucking bitch.</i>

17:38.847 --> 17:43.147
<i>" 'W hy am I still with you?</i>
<i>We have nothing in common.</i>

17:43.251 --> 17:45.116
<i>"'Something's missing. '"</i>

17:45.253 --> 17:47.483
<i>Anyways, I have no religion.</i>

17:47.589 --> 17:49.580
<i>My parents did not</i>
<i>believe in God.</i>

17:49.691 --> 17:51.318
<i>That was great.</i>
<i>They passed that along.</i>

17:51.426 --> 17:52.518
<i>I didn't even have</i>
<i>a fucking choice.</i>

17:52.627 --> 17:55.255
<i>They were like,</i>
<i>"Nope, don't do it."</i>

17:55.364 --> 17:57.798
<i>" Really? So, when Grandpa</i>
<i>dies he goes to heaven?"</i>

17:57.899 --> 18:00.333
<i>" Nope, he'll be in the ground. "<i></i></i>

18:00.435 --> 18:02.630
<i>" Thanks, Dad.</i>
<i>Should I sleep now? 'Cause I...</i>

18:02.738 --> 18:04.467
<i>"There's no way I'll have</i>
<i>a nightmare tonight. "</i>

18:04.573 --> 18:07.406
<i> " Fuck you.</i>
<i>I don't believe in nightmares, either.</i>

18:08.043 --> 18:09.442
<i>" Fags have nightmares.</i>

18:10.979 --> 18:13.004
<i>" If there was a God, why would there
be a Holocaust? Go to bed, Son.</i>

18:14.806 --> 18:15.534
<i>"Pleasant dreams."</i>

18:15.640 --> 18:16.607
Simmons is getting
a little dark.

18:16.708 --> 18:17.868
What is he doing?

18:19.845 --> 18:22.405
<i> When you hear</i>
<i>the waitress's footsteps</i>

18:23.348 --> 18:27.614
<i>that's when you know</i>
<i>you're not doing well.</i>

18:31.556 --> 18:33.456
<i>Oh, boy,</i>
<i>it's quiet in here.</i>

18:37.129 --> 18:38.221
<i>You hear that?</i>

18:41.032 --> 18:43.159
<i>I think I can</i>
<i>hear the freeway.</i>

18:44.503 --> 18:46.471
<i>Hello! I'm Ira Wright.</i>

18:47.672 --> 18:51.073
<i>I'm not good-looking</i>
<i>and I'm not bad-looking.</i>

18:51.176 --> 18:52.609
<i>I'm kind of right</i>
<i>in the middle.</i>

18:52.711 --> 18:55.111
<i>So, like, if I had</i>
<i>a good personality,</i>

18:55.213 --> 18:57.147
<i>that might make it so</i>
<i>girls really liked me,</i>

18:57.249 --> 18:59.217
<i>but I don't. So...</i>

18:59.551 --> 19:01.246
<i>Um... Uh...</i>

19:02.587 --> 19:05.249
<i>Okay. George Simmons. Wow.</i>

19:05.957 --> 19:07.390
<i>Now what do we do?</i>

19:07.959 --> 19:10.860
<i>He seems unhappy with his money.</i>
<i>Give it to me, I'll...</i>

19:10.962 --> 19:13.522
<i>I could really spend that.</i>

19:15.700 --> 19:17.691
<i>If he's depressed with his life,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.</i>

19:17.803 --> 19:19.998
<i>I live on my friend's</i>
<i>pull-out couch.</i>

19:21.072 --> 19:23.131
<i>So, anyway, I...</i>
<i>Wait, did you hear that?</i>

19:23.241 --> 19:26.574
<i>Yeah, George Simmons just shot
himself in the face backstage.</i>

19:26.678 --> 19:28.976
<i>It's sad knowing</i>
<i>MerMan's crying inside.</i>

19:29.247 --> 19:30.407
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

19:30.816 --> 19:33.046
<i>Is he organizing a mass suicide?</i>
<i>Is that where you're going?</i>

19:33.151 --> 19:34.709
<i>Are you joining him?</i>

19:34.820 --> 19:37.380
<i>Save some Kool-Aid for me.</i>
<i>Just do it.</i>

19:37.823 --> 19:41.657
<i>Don't worry, the next guy who's coming out
has a dove hidden up his asshole, so...</i>

19:41.760 --> 19:43.853
<i>And then Robin Williams</i>
<i>is gonna slit his wrists out here.</i>

19:43.962 --> 19:45.293
<i>So, that's nice, also.</i>

19:45.897 --> 19:49.196
<i>I am Ira Wright, everybody. Thank you,
very much. Have a good night.</i>

19:54.239 --> 19:55.638
Give me a break.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.841
Yo! Hey! Hey!

20:08.653 --> 20:10.052
This fucking guy.

20:12.023 --> 20:13.251
What's up?

20:13.358 --> 20:16.384
Hey. I'm sorry.

20:17.229 --> 20:20.357
I'm parked right on the other
side of you and I can't get in.

20:20.465 --> 20:22.933
What, you come here to make
some jokes to my face now?

20:23.034 --> 20:24.433
You're hard to follow.
I didn't know what to say.

20:24.536 --> 20:25.867
I'm sorry about that.
- No, don't be.

20:26.171 --> 20:28.731
I would've done the same.
You had to comment on it.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.234
Yeah, you had some funny shit.

20:32.344 --> 20:33.368
You're a good writer.

20:33.478 --> 20:34.445
Thank you.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.548
Your friend... Is that your friend?
The fatter version of you?

20:39.651 --> 20:41.881
He's my roommate.
- Yeah, he's really funny.

20:41.987 --> 20:44.455
You got good stuff.
You're gonna be all right.

20:44.956 --> 20:46.924
Wow, that is so nice
of you to say, man.

20:47.025 --> 20:48.515
That's so...
I appreciate it. Hey!

20:48.627 --> 20:50.925
You know, well, I've been a
really big fan of yours. All of us.

20:51.029 --> 20:53.463
We kind of grew up on your shit
and, you know, incidentally.

20:53.565 --> 20:56.033
So, that's so nice of you
to say, man. Thanks.

20:57.636 --> 20:58.796
Thank you!

21:00.038 --> 21:01.164
Nice to meet you, man!

21:02.374 --> 21:04.433
You're gonna die!

21:06.478 --> 21:09.003
And I'm gonna kill you!

21:12.817 --> 21:14.614
Man, that was awesome.

21:25.597 --> 21:26.564
Cats.

21:27.933 --> 21:29.594
Can you dig it?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:29.701 --> 21:30.963
Just a bunch of cats.

21:31.636 --> 21:33.069
Then me doing stuff.

21:33.672 --> 21:35.697
Then back to the cats doing stuff.

21:36.641 --> 21:39.769
You've gotten 700,000 hits
in four days from this?

21:39.878 --> 21:43.746
Yep. If you put "cute kitten" in
the title of your YouTube video,

21:43.848 --> 21:45.315
you're gonna get a million hits.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.941
And then I link
that to my website

21:47.052 --> 21:49.577
and you can see my stand-up
on my website. It's genius.

21:49.688 --> 21:52.657
Why don't you just call it like,
"Megan Fox Blows Someone"?

21:52.757 --> 21:55.123
And then more people
would google that.

21:55.226 --> 21:58.286
Hi. I've got two girls coming
over here in a little bit.

21:58.396 --> 22:00.830
Can you fold up your bed,
please, into the couch?

22:00.932 --> 22:02.900
I don't want the place to look
like a mess when they get here.

22:03.001 --> 22:03.968
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was watching this thing.

22:05.136 --> 22:06.398
All right? Okay.

22:09.074 --> 22:10.234
Hello?

22:10.675 --> 22:12.302
<i>Hey, this is George Simmons.</i>

22:13.845 --> 22:15.904
Fuck you, Craig.
What's happening, man?

22:16.014 --> 22:19.006
<i>It's not your dumb-ass friend Craig.</i>
<i>It's George Simmons.</i>

22:20.385 --> 22:21.374
Oh!

22:21.486 --> 22:24.284
I'm sorry. Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?

22:24.389 --> 22:27.358
Hey, hey, good job last night.
You guys were pretty funny.

22:27.459 --> 22:30.428
You and the triple-XL
version of you.

22:30.996 --> 22:34.796
Oh. Yeah. Thank... Thank you. That's...
I... Well, I appreciate that.

22:34.899 --> 22:36.958
<i>You guys are all right.</i>
<i>Good job. I...</i>

22:37.335 --> 22:40.827
I'm doing this corporate
gig for MySpace

22:41.406 --> 22:44.500
and I'm gonna need
some jokes and shit.

22:44.609 --> 22:47.203
I was thinking maybe you guys
would want to write me some.

22:49.247 --> 22:52.842
You know, he's kind of
a flaky guy, but I'm...

22:52.951 --> 22:54.316
I've got nothing going on, man.

22:54.419 --> 22:57.786
I would... I'd love to do that.
Sure. Totally. I'm in.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.450
<i>What kind of jokes</i>
<i>do you need?</i>

22:59.858 --> 23:02.952
Just shit about them or
computers or whatever they like.

23:03.061 --> 23:06.121
<i>When you sprinkle a little lemon
there, they get excited, you know.</i>

23:06.264 --> 23:08.129
<i>That's no problem.</i>
<i>That makes sense.</i>

23:08.233 --> 23:10.497
So, you want to be held accountable,
come watch me do them tomorrow?

23:10.602 --> 23:12.035
<i>I'll take you to the gig.</i>
- Okay, cool, yeah.

23:12.137 --> 23:14.795
How should I... How should I...
How should I get them to you?

23:15.707 --> 23:18.437
I can give you my fax
number and my e-mail.

23:18.543 --> 23:19.635
What's your e-mail?

23:19.744 --> 23:21.939
My e-mail?

23:22.047 --> 23:28.282
It's irasexira@yahoo.com.

23:30.588 --> 23:33.056
Wow. I'm just... I'm starting
to reconsider asking you.

23:33.158 --> 23:35.524
<i>Don't do that. It's from
high school. It was funny then.</i>

23:35.627 --> 23:36.924
Yeah, you should change it.

23:37.028 --> 23:38.757
<i>It's, like, 13 years old.</i>
<i>Okay, I will.</i>

23:38.863 --> 23:40.125
I mean change it now.

23:40.231 --> 23:42.358
Okay, I'll change it,
I'll change it ASAP.

23:43.435 --> 23:45.130
<i>Okay, don't say</i>
<i>"ASAP," either.</i>

23:45.236 --> 23:49.070
<i>And don't say "I'm chilling"</i>
<i>or "It's all good" or any of that stuff.</i>

23:49.174 --> 23:52.200
<i>Okay, I don't.</i>
<i>I don't chill anyway, so I won't.</i>

23:52.310 --> 23:54.505
<i>And it's not all good,</i>
<i>so don't worry.</i>

23:54.612 --> 23:56.102
Okay, Ira.
<i>- Okay.</i>

23:56.247 --> 23:57.976
All right, Ira.

24:01.653 --> 24:04.918
Guys, that was
George Simmons on the phone.

24:05.023 --> 24:06.422
He saw me do stand-up.

24:06.524 --> 24:08.890
He thinks I'm funny!
He wants me to write jokes for him!

24:08.993 --> 24:10.460
What?
- Yep!

24:10.995 --> 24:11.962
Why?

24:12.063 --> 24:13.553
Why? He thinks I'm funny!

24:13.665 --> 24:15.155
This doesn't make
any sense at all.

24:15.266 --> 24:16.233
No?

24:16.768 --> 24:18.429
Jeez, I gotta get started.

24:19.737 --> 24:20.704
What is happening?

24:20.805 --> 24:21.999
You forgot about the bed!

24:24.609 --> 24:27.134
Friends. Friends on MySpace.
Nerds.

24:27.245 --> 24:29.713
Nerds... Nerds have
no friends in real life.

24:29.814 --> 24:33.272
The more friends on MySpace, the
less friends you have in real life.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.318
"How does the softball
team at MySpace work?

24:35.420 --> 24:38.253
"Does everyone get picked last?"
That could be funny.

24:38.356 --> 24:40.790
At some point, you should have
George say, "Fuck Facebook!"

24:40.892 --> 24:42.519
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

24:43.962 --> 24:47.796
So, like, that's funny.
- All right, tell George I wrote that, okay?

24:47.899 --> 24:48.888
Totally. Totally, man.
You gotta be like,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.592
"Leo wrote that."
- Yeah, no, no, no, totally.

25:04.582 --> 25:06.243
Hey, Ira,
I think this is him!

25:10.388 --> 25:11.787
He's got a limo!

25:11.890 --> 25:12.879
Can we go out and meet him?

25:12.991 --> 25:14.117
No, no, no.
You can't say hi to him.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.159
Just let me get in
with him a little more

25:16.261 --> 25:17.523
before I introduce
people to him.

25:17.629 --> 25:19.028
Don't kiss his ass
too hard, all right?

25:19.130 --> 25:21.223
Stars hate it when you
kiss their ass too hard.

25:21.332 --> 25:23.163
I hate it when people kiss my ass too hard.
- You do?

25:23.268 --> 25:24.565
You hate it when people
kiss your ass too hard?

25:24.669 --> 25:25.966
I hate it.

25:34.179 --> 25:35.146
Man!

25:35.246 --> 25:38.044
Hey. I feel like
we're going to prom.

25:38.149 --> 25:41.676
Okay, well, we're not.
Okay, let's hit it!

25:43.488 --> 25:45.217
This is good.
I like this one

25:45.323 --> 25:49.054
about the guy from MySpace and the guy
from Craigslist getting into a fight.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.320
That's funny.

25:50.428 --> 25:51.827
You're excited.

25:51.930 --> 25:52.897
I am excited.

25:52.997 --> 25:54.123
Yeah, that's good.
It's good to be excited.

25:54.232 --> 25:55.460
I used to be excited.

25:55.567 --> 25:57.728
Well, it's awesome.
It's exciting.

26:05.310 --> 26:06.709
Wow!

26:14.852 --> 26:16.114
Thank you!

26:26.831 --> 26:27.957
Yeah!

26:29.567 --> 26:31.967
Brought the nice legs
with you. Good job.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.697
Hello, hello.
Good to see you, sir.

26:33.805 --> 26:35.067
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

26:35.173 --> 26:36.162
The name's Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

26:36.274 --> 26:37.298
We may hit a few bumps up there,

26:37.408 --> 26:38.602
nothing too crazy.
We'll get you there.

26:38.710 --> 26:39.699
Okay, cool!
All right.

26:39.811 --> 26:41.745
Hope you enjoy Chinese food.
- I love it!

26:41.846 --> 26:43.746
Very good. Enjoy your flight.
- Thank you.

26:44.616 --> 26:45.583
Wow!

26:50.722 --> 26:52.849
You guys were a little late, so we
had to put up James Taylor first.

26:52.957 --> 26:55.892
<i>Karen, she's a silver sun</i>

26:55.994 --> 26:59.555
<i>You'd best walk her way</i>
<i>and watch it shine</i>

27:00.798 --> 27:04.097
<i>Watch her watch</i>
<i>the morning come</i>

27:06.704 --> 27:13.337
<i>A silver tear appearing now</i>
<i>that I'm cryin', ain't I</i>

27:13.811 --> 27:18.248
<i>I'm going to Carolina</i>
<i>in my mind</i>

27:18.349 --> 27:19.543
How'd you guys get him?

27:19.651 --> 27:20.777
Everybody's got their price.

27:20.885 --> 27:23.410
Last year, we had Roger Waters
doing <i>Dark Side of the Moon.</i>

27:24.489 --> 27:27.083
<i>That love's</i>
<i>the finest thing around...</i>

27:27.225 --> 27:30.194
Okay, I thought it could
be funny if you just go,

27:30.295 --> 27:32.229
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

27:32.330 --> 27:34.958
All right. Hey, you do five
minutes before I go up there.

27:35.667 --> 27:39.034
What? No. No, I can't follow <i>Fire and Rain.</i>
Are you kidding me, man?

27:39.137 --> 27:41.332
I can't follow it, either.
That's why you're going up there.

27:41.906 --> 27:48.778
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

27:52.583 --> 27:54.312
<i>Thank you, MySpace!</i>

27:57.455 --> 27:58.888
<i>Fuck Facebook!</i>

28:01.559 --> 28:03.424
I can't believe that.
He did the Facebook joke!

28:03.528 --> 28:05.189
Yeah!
He did the Facebook...

28:05.296 --> 28:07.321
I can't follow this, man.
I can't go on right now.

28:07.432 --> 28:11.129
Give me this shit.
Get up there. Be a man.

28:13.237 --> 28:14.932
<i>This is a pretty big room.</i>

28:17.475 --> 28:18.464
<i>Lot of people here.</i>

28:19.981 --> 28:23.075
<i>Let's have another round of applause
for James Taylor, everybody.</i>

28:30.191 --> 28:32.682
Yeah, do you
actually use MySpace?

28:33.861 --> 28:36.762
No, no, no. I fuck girls, Tom.
I don't have time for that.

28:37.532 --> 28:40.797
<i>I wonder if Tom and Craig from Craigslist
would ever get in a fight with each other.</i>

28:42.003 --> 28:44.631
<i>Who would win that fight?</i>
<i>That's what I want to know.</i>

28:49.110 --> 28:51.203
<i>Tom or Craig,</i>
<i>who's tougher?</i>

28:51.913 --> 28:55.076
<i>Tom has more friends,</i>
<i>so that's probably good.</i>

28:55.183 --> 28:57.048
<i>Craig has weirder</i>
<i>friends, though.</i>

28:58.719 --> 29:02.553
<i>Craig has friends that are willing to
do a lot more for cash. I will say that.</i>

29:08.930 --> 29:09.919
Eh?

29:10.031 --> 29:10.998
What the fuck was that all about?

29:11.098 --> 29:12.622
You did all the jokes
you wrote for me.

29:12.733 --> 29:15.031
Oh, man, I know. I'm sorry.
I panicked. It's all they wanted.

29:15.136 --> 29:16.535
They just wanted MySpace jokes.
They didn't want...

29:16.637 --> 29:17.865
That's why I hired you
to write me MySpace jokes.

29:17.972 --> 29:19.234
I know, I'm sorry.
That one, I didn't tell that one.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.329
That one will work.

29:20.441 --> 29:21.408
I guarantee you.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.477
It better work.
They're paying me 300 grand.

29:23.578 --> 29:25.341
<i>Mr. George Simmons!</i>
- Really?

29:29.650 --> 29:33.711
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>All right, Tom, thank you.</i>

29:33.821 --> 29:37.416
<i>Good evening, nerds! Yes!</i>

29:37.525 --> 29:40.892
<i>What about Ira, everybody?</i>
<i>How'd you feel about Ira Wright? Yeah.</i>

29:40.995 --> 29:42.690
<i>That guy, man.</i>

29:42.797 --> 29:46.392
<i>He is such a fucking nerd, I can't believe
he doesn't work with you people.</i>

29:47.869 --> 29:51.100
<i>Tom started MySpace just
to get friends, I know it.</i>

29:51.873 --> 29:53.864
<i>So, they say the more friends</i>
<i>you have on MySpace,</i>

29:53.975 --> 29:57.877
<i>the less friends you have in real life.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

29:57.979 --> 30:00.641
<i>"I have 100,000
friends on MySpace!</i>

30:01.215 --> 30:02.682
<i>" Yes!</i>

30:03.885 --> 30:07.753
<i>" Isn't that great?</i>
<i>I have so many friends on the computer. "</i>

30:08.556 --> 30:09.523
<i>"What are you doing tonight?"</i>

30:09.624 --> 30:11.421
<i>" I'll be on the computer.</i>

30:12.293 --> 30:13.920
<i>"That's what I do."</i>

30:17.665 --> 30:20.600
<i>I hate the new generation</i>
<i>of coolness out there.</i>

30:20.701 --> 30:24.967
<i>You just never get any information out
of people you talk to, the youngsters.</i>

30:25.072 --> 30:27.199
<i>"Hey, what are you doing?"</i>
<i>"Just chilling."</i>

30:27.708 --> 30:30.336
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I know, you're chilling.</i>

30:31.412 --> 30:35.849
<i>"What're you doing tonight?"</i>
<i>"Things." "Okay."</i>

30:35.950 --> 30:38.214
<i>I like dumb people, you know.</i>
<i>They like to talk to you.</i>

30:38.319 --> 30:40.787
<i>"Hey, what's going on?"</i>
<i>"I like lollypops."</i>

30:42.323 --> 30:43.290
<i>"Good."</i>

30:46.827 --> 30:49.421
<i>" My favorite color</i>
<i>is butterscotch. "</i>

30:50.431 --> 30:55.528
Do you ever get tired of singing the
same songs, you know, over and over?

30:56.404 --> 30:59.100
Do you ever get tired
of talking about your dick?

31:00.207 --> 31:02.641
<i>Yeah, I don't like...</i>
<i>I don't like blowjobs very much.</i>

31:02.743 --> 31:04.506
<i>I don't like...</i>
<i>A lot of guys like the blowjobs,</i>

31:04.612 --> 31:08.139
<i>I don't love them. I never know what
to do with my hands. You know?</i>

31:08.249 --> 31:10.046
<i>I'm always like...</i>

31:12.520 --> 31:16.980
<i>You can either go hands on
the hips or the salute is fun.</i>

31:20.962 --> 31:22.429
<i>Yeah, it's always shocking</i>
<i>when a girl blows you.</i>

31:22.530 --> 31:24.657
<i>You're like, " Really?</i>
<i>You want to do it? All right. "</i>

31:25.232 --> 31:26.893
<i>I got some advice</i>
<i>for the ladies out there.</i>

31:27.001 --> 31:31.404
<i>When you are performing that
act on a fellow don't ever say,</i>

31:31.505 --> 31:34.565
<i>" You know, you're the first guy I ever
got the whole thing in my mouth.</i>

31:36.477 --> 31:41.710
<i>" Normally, normally, I get, like, halfway
down and I just start fucking choking,</i>

31:42.216 --> 31:47.085
<i>" but with you,</i>
<i>I got a ball in my mouth!</i>

31:47.288 --> 31:49.153
<i>" That's never happened!</i>

31:50.424 --> 31:56.090
<i>" Look, I have him in my mouth right
now, and I'm speaking perfectly clear.</i>

31:57.698 --> 31:59.791
<i>"Normally I have a stutter."</i>

32:01.669 --> 32:04.661
That wasn't a pee, that was a shit.
That took too long.

32:04.772 --> 32:06.763
Here's 1,000 bucks.
Good job.

32:06.874 --> 32:08.637
Thank you so much, man.

32:08.743 --> 32:10.973
I've never made this much money
doing anything, man. Thank you.

32:11.078 --> 32:14.377
Good. I'm thinking about
doing a lot more stand-up.

32:14.482 --> 32:15.449
Okay.

32:15.549 --> 32:17.813
And my assistant
got pregnant.

32:17.918 --> 32:20.250
I didn't even know she...
I thought she was a fucking lesbian

32:20.354 --> 32:21.321
the whole time, but...

32:21.422 --> 32:22.650
They can get pregnant, too.

32:23.791 --> 32:25.156
That's nice. That's very nice.
- Yeah.

32:25.259 --> 32:28.751
So, you want to kind
of assist me, you know?

32:28.863 --> 32:29.955
Yeah! Yeah.
I mean, not, not...

32:30.064 --> 32:31.292
I mean, you can write
jokes for me, too,

32:31.399 --> 32:32.388
but get me sodas...

32:32.500 --> 32:33.467
Whatever you need, man!

32:33.567 --> 32:35.228
...and, like, clean my shit up and...
- Yeah.

32:35.336 --> 32:36.826
How much money you make now?

32:36.937 --> 32:38.370
It depends on how many hours.

32:38.472 --> 32:39.734
Usually, I can get about...

32:39.840 --> 32:41.569
I'll give you 1,500 bucks a week.

32:41.676 --> 32:43.303
That's amazing, man.
Thank you so much.

32:43.411 --> 32:44.810
You want to fuck these two girls?

32:46.313 --> 32:48.781
Hey, the JT.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.044
George. That was the best.
You killed them.

32:51.152 --> 32:52.119
Ira.

32:52.219 --> 32:54.380
Hello. Yes, Mr. Taylor.
Yes, hello.

32:54.789 --> 32:55.813
You wanna fuck these girls?

32:55.923 --> 33:00.019
I filled my quota
in 1982, I believe.

33:00.127 --> 33:01.253
All right, I'll have
to figure this shit out.

33:01.362 --> 33:02.351
I know those girls.

33:02.463 --> 33:04.158
You do?
Do you want to meet those girls?

33:04.265 --> 33:06.790
Will you fucking settle down?
Yeah, talk to them. Be gentle.

33:07.001 --> 33:10.129
You're twitching like a fucking
madman. That guy in porno?

33:10.638 --> 33:12.196
No. I would know.
- No?

33:16.091 --> 33:18.025
Mandy. Well, hi there.

33:18.127 --> 33:20.152
You're still swimming?
Get the fuck out of there.

33:20.262 --> 33:21.957
I'm ready for you.

33:22.064 --> 33:23.395
Yeah. Oh, my God.

33:25.801 --> 33:27.598
Oh, God. Feel that stomach.
Oh. Yeah.

33:27.703 --> 33:29.227
I like that thing.
Good. Well, go for it.

33:29.338 --> 33:30.771
It's hard. Bam!

33:33.475 --> 33:34.772
This house is crazy.

33:34.877 --> 33:36.139
Oh, yeah, you got
to see the whole thing.

33:36.245 --> 33:37.974
Come here.
It came furnished.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.069
Really?

33:40.249 --> 33:43.480
That's my man, Ira. He wrote a
lot of good jokes for me there, honey.

33:43.585 --> 33:46.383
Make sure he shows you his cock.
It's very, very thick.

33:47.589 --> 33:49.056
See you, George.

33:54.763 --> 33:57.254
Hey, wanna have a contest to see who
can hold their breath the longest?

34:10.279 --> 34:11.906
You didn't go under.

34:13.681 --> 34:16.014
Nothing's gonna
happen between us.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.984
I can't believe I'm having
sex with George Simmons.

34:21.255 --> 34:23.520
Yeah, he can't believe it, either.

34:23.859 --> 34:26.259
My dad loves your movies.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.989
Yeah, that's the best when
you talk about your dad.

34:38.739 --> 34:41.300
<i>Dad, this won't</i>
<i>bring Mom back!</i>

34:41.409 --> 34:44.402
<i>I have nothing else!</i>

34:44.513 --> 34:47.277
<i>You're a champion, Dad!</i>
<i>You're a champion!</i>

34:53.255 --> 34:55.018
Oh! You're still here.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.816
I know that asshole.

34:58.961 --> 35:00.826
You two were just fucking, huh?
How'd that go?

35:00.929 --> 35:04.194
No, I have a boyfriend.
We already talked about it.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.058
Yeah. John.
Yeah.

35:06.602 --> 35:09.162
Your friend took off.
She thought you left, so...

35:09.271 --> 35:10.238
Really?

35:10.339 --> 35:11.567
That's what happens
in a big house.

35:11.673 --> 35:12.970
It's called "the big
house problem."

35:13.075 --> 35:15.669
Your friend actually left
her purse down the hall.

35:15.777 --> 35:17.210
You want to go get it with me?

35:17.312 --> 35:18.279
Oh. Okay.

35:23.585 --> 35:25.246
Don't you leave on me, Ira.

35:25.787 --> 35:26.947
Fuck me like MerMan!

35:27.055 --> 35:30.354
Come on! Do MerMan!
Do the MerMan call!

35:30.726 --> 35:31.693
Come on!

35:31.793 --> 35:34.694
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Oh, God!

35:39.768 --> 35:41.133
Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

35:41.737 --> 35:43.830
Sorry about the chick, man. I...

35:43.939 --> 35:46.339
You weren't getting it done,
so something had to happen.

35:46.441 --> 35:48.500
Oh, that's... No, she...
I wasn't even trying.

35:48.610 --> 35:50.339
She told me
she had a boyfriend.

35:50.746 --> 35:53.340
Oh, yeah. She told me
she had a boyfriend, too.

35:53.448 --> 35:56.212
<i>When she</i>
<i>was sucking my cock!</i>

36:00.789 --> 36:02.780
What the fuck are you doing
with that big dick of yours?

36:02.891 --> 36:06.054
You gotta use it! You gotta
share Thickie with the world.

36:06.161 --> 36:07.822
I don't... It's normal.

36:07.930 --> 36:11.263
You want to go upstairs, man?
Talk to me while I try to fall asleep?

36:12.201 --> 36:14.669
Okay, if...
Yeah, if that's what you want me to do.

36:15.737 --> 36:20.037
Yeah, yeah. Sit down, man.
That was a fun night.

36:20.609 --> 36:21.598
That was a good night.

36:21.710 --> 36:22.677
Yeah, that was crazy.

36:22.778 --> 36:23.745
Yeah.

36:23.845 --> 36:26.609
So, you slept with
both those girls, man.

36:27.549 --> 36:28.709
How did you do that?

36:29.218 --> 36:30.913
How did I do that?
There's this...

36:31.019 --> 36:34.978
Girls like famous guys. It's a story
for them, I guess. I don't know.

36:35.090 --> 36:36.785
I take advantage
of it, though.

36:36.892 --> 36:38.985
Believe me, they always
leave disappointed.

36:39.595 --> 36:41.529
That's amazing.

36:43.832 --> 36:46.494
Yeah, yeah, so let me hear
about this name, Ira Wright.

36:46.602 --> 36:48.467
That's not your real name, right?

36:49.137 --> 36:50.263
How could you tell?

36:51.506 --> 36:53.531
You're hiding some Judaism.

36:53.642 --> 36:55.507
No, my real last name is Wiener.

36:55.611 --> 36:57.340
It's Ira Wiener and everyone...

36:57.446 --> 37:01.382
It's spelled the same as "wiener" and
I just got tired of correcting people.

37:01.483 --> 37:03.781
So, that's what led you
to the path of comedy.

37:03.885 --> 37:06.945
Being humiliated every day.
First day of school,

37:07.055 --> 37:09.046
"Is Ira Wiener here?"

37:09.157 --> 37:10.124
And you were in the back.

37:10.225 --> 37:13.786
"Wiener. My name's Wiener."

37:13.895 --> 37:16.295
You little fruit.
What were your parents like?

37:16.398 --> 37:19.367
What are the older
"Wieners" or Wieners like?

37:20.369 --> 37:21.393
My parents are divorced.

37:21.503 --> 37:26.338
They hate each other.
My mother thinks my father's the devil.

37:27.676 --> 37:29.837
I don't know what that
makes me, technically, but...

37:30.279 --> 37:32.372
So, you'll never
be as funny as me.

37:32.481 --> 37:33.470
Why not?

37:33.582 --> 37:36.574
Your generation has the
divorces, which is cute-funny,

37:36.685 --> 37:42.248
but my generation has the, "Oh, my God,
my father's about to hit me with a bat!"

37:43.425 --> 37:48.863
I just... You gotta break out the funny a
lot quicker than your little faggy childhood.

37:50.899 --> 37:52.423
Are you serious?

37:52.534 --> 37:55.935
I spent my whole childhood
trying to make my father laugh.

37:56.605 --> 37:59.438
I still haven't succeeded,
but we'll get there.

38:05.013 --> 38:08.779
Don't bail on me yet.
Keep it coming.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.543
When's the first time
you fingered a girl?

38:11.653 --> 38:14.918
I was at summer camp, Jewish
summer camp, on the sports field.

38:17.693 --> 38:22.426
And her name
was Sharon Mizrahi.

38:23.198 --> 38:26.429
I didn't know what to do.
I got really scared.

38:26.535 --> 38:30.266
She reached down and
grabbed my penis really hard,

38:30.372 --> 38:32.203
like she was just
trying to murder it.

38:42.517 --> 38:43.848
Morning.
- Yeah, baby.

38:43.952 --> 38:46.819
It took me three hours, but
I think I found your kitchen.

38:47.322 --> 38:49.119
Am I in the bathroom still?
Is that it?

38:49.224 --> 38:51.590
No, no.
You're good. You're safe.

38:51.727 --> 38:52.694
What do you got there?

38:52.794 --> 38:54.955
This is medicine, Ira.
I'm sick.

38:55.063 --> 38:57.725
One of those girls have chlamydia?
I thought she smelled funny.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.460
Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

39:00.001 --> 39:05.029
I have a weird blood disease.
AML. It's a form of leukemia.

39:05.774 --> 39:08.470
This is experimental
medicine from Canada.

39:09.211 --> 39:14.171
There's an 8% chance
of it working. So, fuck me.

39:14.616 --> 39:16.982
Well, that's not true
'cause if it was,

39:17.085 --> 39:18.712
I would've read about it
or heard about that.

39:18.820 --> 39:19.912
You didn't hear
about it because

39:20.021 --> 39:23.013
I didn't fucking run out and tell
<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

39:23.125 --> 39:24.956
Well, why would you tell me?

39:25.060 --> 39:26.857
'Cause I don't
really know you, Ira.

39:26.962 --> 39:30.090
I think you're not gonna
get too weird about this.

39:30.198 --> 39:33.531
I don't want to start getting
treated like the guy who's gonna die.

39:33.835 --> 39:37.931
So, anyways, this shit's
got a lot of caffeine in it.

39:38.039 --> 39:40.974
They say that's good for you.
Let me take the medicine.

39:41.076 --> 39:42.600
Why are you telling
me this, George?

39:42.711 --> 39:45.544
'Cause I want you
to possibly do me a favor.

39:45.647 --> 39:46.841
Okay. Yeah. What?

39:47.649 --> 39:48.741
Kill me.

39:49.518 --> 39:50.485
What?

39:50.585 --> 39:51.711
Nobody knows
we know each other.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.380
You're a stranger.
You can get away with this.

39:54.489 --> 39:57.617
I got a gun in the other room.
It's untraceable.

39:57.726 --> 40:00.718
I'll give you $50,000.

40:00.829 --> 40:06.859
Don't make me suffer.
Please, kill me, Ira. I'm begging you.

40:07.169 --> 40:09.160
Can you at least give me,
like, a night to think about it?

40:09.271 --> 40:10.397
Ha!

40:10.505 --> 40:12.496
Think about it?
You would do it!

40:12.607 --> 40:15.269
Oh, I hate you, man.
- Oh, no!

40:15.377 --> 40:21.043
Ira, I misread you.
You're sick! You're a murderer!

40:21.149 --> 40:22.138
Screw you, man.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.239
You wanted to do it!

40:23.351 --> 40:25.842
What would you have done for $100,000?
Chop my head off?

40:25.954 --> 40:27.421
You would still want to do it!

40:27.522 --> 40:29.251
That wasn't even
good acting over there!

40:29.357 --> 40:30.654
What the fuck?
- That was good acting.

40:30.759 --> 40:32.750
Daniel Day-Lewis would've
crushed that speech.

40:32.861 --> 40:35.455
I bought that, man. Wow!

40:35.564 --> 40:38.795
Ira, you don't have to kill me,
but I am gonna die.

40:39.201 --> 40:41.032
George, look. Honestly, I'm like...
Don't get close, Ira.

40:41.136 --> 40:42.626
...a really gullible guy.
Don't do this.

40:42.737 --> 40:44.068
Look, my friends, they
trick me all the time.

40:44.172 --> 40:45.833
One of my roommates told me
he was Joe Pesci's son.

40:45.941 --> 40:48.432
I believed him for three
years. I still get shit for it,

40:48.543 --> 40:50.477
so just, please,
level with me, man.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.877
Are you serious?
- I am serious, Ira.

40:53.415 --> 40:55.383
Don't tell anybody about
this though, all right?

40:55.484 --> 40:57.042
I want it to be our secret.

40:57.152 --> 40:59.712
Now, you're gonna make me
some eggs. Okay, murderer?

41:00.255 --> 41:01.222
Don't say that.

41:01.323 --> 41:03.223
Just try not to kill
any of the staff

41:03.325 --> 41:06.021
while I'm gone, okay?
They have families.

41:06.795 --> 41:08.353
Well, he actually tricked
me first, but then he showed...

41:08.463 --> 41:09.657
I mean, he's taking medicine.

41:09.764 --> 41:12.255
He's getting this special
medicine from Canada.

41:12.567 --> 41:14.432
Oh, my God, that's the
saddest thing I've ever heard.

41:14.536 --> 41:18.063
Yeah. I think I'm the
only person he's told.

41:18.173 --> 41:21.142
That's what he said. I mean, he's
really... He likes me, in a weird...

41:21.276 --> 41:23.904
I think he's, like, taken
a shine to me, you know.

41:24.012 --> 41:26.003
Not enough to let you in
on that two-on-one.

41:26.114 --> 41:27.411
Come on, that's not appropriate.

41:27.516 --> 41:28.949
I don't want that anyway.

41:30.785 --> 41:32.776
I just don't know.
I mean, it's...

41:32.888 --> 41:34.788
It's really scary.
I've never even...

41:34.890 --> 41:37.188
I don't think I've known
anyone who's, like, sick,

41:37.292 --> 41:39.760
you know, in like a major way
before. I don't... I just...

41:39.861 --> 41:42.694
George Simmons.
He's been around my whole life.

41:42.797 --> 41:44.765
It's like Snap, Crackle
and Pop dying, you know?

41:44.866 --> 41:45.833
I know.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.526
Can we not talk
about this right now?

41:47.802 --> 41:49.929
I'm not really good
with the whole death thing.

41:50.038 --> 41:51.369
Is that all right?

41:51.473 --> 41:53.805
I need to talk about it, man.
I work for this guy now.

41:53.909 --> 41:56.036
I can't... I mean, that's all
I'm... It's all I'm thinking about.

41:56.144 --> 42:00.046
I'm gonna tell you this story that
makes me feel all right with death.

42:00.982 --> 42:03.712
When I was younger,
my grandfather died

42:03.818 --> 42:05.376
and we were all
gathered around him

42:05.487 --> 42:08.684
and there was this one
candle next to his bed.

42:08.790 --> 42:13.989
And right after he died, the candle started
flickering and then it just went out.

42:14.462 --> 42:15.486
Wow.
- Yeah.

42:15.597 --> 42:18.361
And we looked around,
and there were no windows.

42:18.934 --> 42:21.459
Like, nothing in that room.

42:22.203 --> 42:24.728
And it sounds crazy,
but we all thought

42:24.839 --> 42:27.171
it was him going
to heaven, you know?

42:27.275 --> 42:29.505
You don't pass through
fire to get to heaven.

42:29.611 --> 42:30.578
I think he went to hell.

42:31.780 --> 42:33.338
What'd you just say?
- I just...

42:33.448 --> 42:35.143
I think your grandfather
probably went to hell.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.184
Don't do it.
Are you kidding me right now?

42:37.285 --> 42:38.877
I'm... I'm sorry
to break it to you.

42:38.987 --> 42:40.113
You're gonna make
fun of me right now,

42:40.221 --> 42:42.246
just after I opened up
to you guys like that?

42:42.357 --> 42:44.052
It's not my fault your
grandfather's in hell.

42:44.159 --> 42:45.217
It's not a big deal.
Some grandpas go to hell.

42:46.694 --> 42:47.683
Come on.
Don't be a jerk to me

42:47.795 --> 42:49.353
just because I make
more money than you guys.

42:49.464 --> 42:50.431
How much do you make again?

42:51.866 --> 42:54.835
You guys are just projecting
all your hatred onto me.

42:54.936 --> 42:56.335
Okay, and don't be
super bummed out

42:56.437 --> 42:59.338
'cause your grandfather's playing
backgammon with Hitler right now.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.930
Shit, dude, don't.

43:04.646 --> 43:06.273
I gotta get rid of this stuff.

43:07.549 --> 43:10.074
Man, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it.

43:11.119 --> 43:13.644
The more money you make, the
more free shit they give you.

43:13.755 --> 43:18.215
It makes no sense. I don't see
any jet skiing in my near future.

43:18.326 --> 43:19.987
All this shit was free?

43:20.094 --> 43:21.061
You want a TV, Ira?

43:21.162 --> 43:24.427
I got, like, three flat screens
laying around in there somewhere.

43:24.532 --> 43:27.695
Sure, I can... Yeah, I can just take
this stuff to Goodwill if you want or...

43:27.802 --> 43:30.532
You know what? Don't even
worry about this stuff. Let's...

43:30.638 --> 43:33.038
I got some cars in storage
you could sell for me

43:33.141 --> 43:35.166
and just give
that money to charity.

43:35.276 --> 43:36.243
I can do that, yeah.

43:36.344 --> 43:37.368
I'm gonna write a list out for you,

43:37.478 --> 43:39.412
give you a bunch of
things I want you to do.

43:39.514 --> 43:40.640
What size sneaker are you?

43:40.748 --> 43:41.715
Eleven and a half.

43:41.816 --> 43:44.910
You got that thick cock,
don't you? I want to see that thing.

43:45.019 --> 43:46.714
Come on, pull the cock out.

43:46.821 --> 43:47.810
I'm not gonna show it to you.

43:47.922 --> 43:48.889
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

43:48.990 --> 43:50.218
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

43:50.325 --> 43:52.190
I just want to know
what I'm dealing with.

43:52.293 --> 43:53.351
If you give me an iPod.

43:53.461 --> 43:54.758
You asshole.

43:54.862 --> 43:56.295
All right, you can
have anything in here,

43:56.397 --> 43:58.297
but you gotta take
the <i>MerMan</i> poster.

43:58.399 --> 44:00.333
No, I want...
I love <i>MerMan!</i>

44:00.435 --> 44:01.732
I knew you loved <i>MerMan.</i>

44:01.836 --> 44:03.770
You and five-year-olds
love <i>MerMan.</i>

44:04.439 --> 44:05.633
It's a smart movie.

44:07.609 --> 44:12.069
So, which, specifically, of the
cars belong to George Simmons?

44:12.714 --> 44:14.238
Which one?
- Yeah.

44:14.349 --> 44:15.543
All of them.

44:16.017 --> 44:17.348
All of them?
- Yeah.

44:17.452 --> 44:18.817
Well...

44:19.354 --> 44:21.322
How would I go about selling?

44:22.257 --> 44:23.815
Selling them?
- Yeah.

44:24.259 --> 44:26.989
Well, I don't know about selling
them but I can make a few disappear.

44:27.095 --> 44:28.426
You know what I'm saying?

44:29.397 --> 44:30.728
I don't want to do that.

44:30.832 --> 44:32.800
I don't want to do that, either.

44:33.034 --> 44:34.467
Just kidding.

44:40.775 --> 44:43.539
Scene D is up!
Let's go on a bell. <i>Yo Teach!</i>

44:44.746 --> 44:45.940
And action!

44:46.047 --> 44:47.947
All right now...
Bradford!

44:48.049 --> 44:49.676
Yeah?
What is this?

44:51.768 --> 44:53.030
Bo's English test.

44:53.136 --> 44:54.467
Well, there's a mistake.

44:55.405 --> 44:57.066
Well, yeah, there
are lots of mistakes.

44:57.173 --> 44:58.800
That's why there's an F on it.

44:58.908 --> 45:02.400
You know, if Bo doesn't pass,
he can't play in the big game Friday.

45:02.512 --> 45:04.139
<i>Either you</i>
<i>make this right,</i>

45:04.247 --> 45:09.082
<i>or you'll be spending the summer
teaching driver's ed. Honk, honk!</i>

45:10.387 --> 45:11.615
Shit.

45:11.721 --> 45:13.018
I can't be a part of this.
I'm not...

45:13.123 --> 45:14.351
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

45:15.759 --> 45:17.283
This is just so painful,
though, isn't it?

45:17.394 --> 45:19.692
Yes, I want to kill myself.

45:20.597 --> 45:23.088
So, where are you from, originally?
You just moved here, right?

45:23.199 --> 45:24.860
Yep. Delaware.

45:24.968 --> 45:27.869
Delaware! Our first
state in the Union.

45:27.971 --> 45:29.438
Yes, it is.

45:29.739 --> 45:31.866
That's great.
No sales tax in Delaware, right?

45:31.975 --> 45:33.636
Yeah, there's not.
That's weird.

45:33.743 --> 45:35.643
You know so much
about Delaware.

45:35.745 --> 45:37.337
You fucking Joe Biden?

45:37.447 --> 45:39.415
He's from Delaware.
- See? I knew that.

45:40.517 --> 45:42.849
<i>Bo, you're a smart kid.</i>
<i>I've seen you rap.</i>

45:42.952 --> 45:44.078
<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>- All right?</i>

45:44.187 --> 45:46.678
<i>Now, I am willing to give you a
makeup exam on this, all right?</i>

45:46.790 --> 45:48.052
Do you like music?

45:48.158 --> 45:49.420
Did you just ask me
if I liked music?

45:49.526 --> 45:52.290
Yeah. That... I'm... I'm aware
that that's a weird question.

45:52.395 --> 45:54.158
It's like asking me
if I like food.

45:54.264 --> 45:56.255
That was my next question.

45:56.499 --> 45:57.864
Yes.
- Good.

45:57.967 --> 46:01.562
Wilco. Do you like Wilco?
Wilco's playing at the Greek Theatre.

46:01.671 --> 46:04.139
And I was just wondering if
you maybe wanted to go with me.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.504
Yeah. I'll go. I'd be
into that. I like Wilco.

46:06.609 --> 46:07.598
Great.

46:07.710 --> 46:12.147
Okay, great, great. So, I guess
we will go to the show together.

46:12.248 --> 46:13.613
Not anymore.

46:14.717 --> 46:15.945
You serious?

46:16.820 --> 46:18.515
No, I'll go.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

46:18.621 --> 46:19.610
Just don't say that ever again.

46:19.722 --> 46:20.689
Okay. I won't.

46:20.790 --> 46:22.280
<i>Yo, Teach!</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

46:23.359 --> 46:24.417
<i>Thanks.</i>

46:25.028 --> 46:25.995
<i>Word.</i>

46:26.596 --> 46:32.662
<i>Do-ra-mi, wiener</i>

46:32.769 --> 46:36.330
<i>My name is Wiener</i>

46:36.940 --> 46:40.034
<i>My name is Wiener</i>
<i>My name is Wiener</i>

46:40.143 --> 46:41.838
<i>Don't call me wiener</i>

46:42.212 --> 46:45.511
Whatever.
You got any jokes for me, dum-dum?

46:45.615 --> 46:47.674
Got some good ones,
I think, actually.

46:48.051 --> 46:51.543
I have a thing about how,
like, you're rich, you know,

46:51.654 --> 46:52.780
and so you bought
a private jet,

46:52.889 --> 46:54.049
but you're afraid of flying,

46:54.157 --> 46:55.124
so you just drive in it.

46:55.225 --> 46:56.419
Oh, that's funny.

46:56.526 --> 46:58.858
You just go to
drive-throughs and car washes.

46:58.962 --> 47:01.624
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll come up
with the ending, but that was good.

47:02.232 --> 47:05.793
I thought it could be funny about
your balls, you know, about how, like,

47:05.902 --> 47:09.338
you're getting older and you found
the first gray hair on your balls.

47:09.439 --> 47:11.669
And it really worried you, but
then you realized it was good

47:11.774 --> 47:14.140
'cause it made your balls
look distinguished and smart.

47:14.244 --> 47:17.702
Like, if you gave your balls a little tweed
jacket with elbow pads and a little pipe,

47:17.814 --> 47:21.944
your balls could be like a character
Kevin Kline would play in a movie.

47:22.051 --> 47:25.043
Yeah, that's funny,
that's funny. I could do that.

47:25.155 --> 47:26.179
What else you got?

47:26.289 --> 47:29.918
Actually, this just
kind of happened.

47:30.994 --> 47:33.428
I'm making you
an iTunes playlist.

47:33.530 --> 47:35.464
For what?
- Sometimes, when I'm upset,

47:35.565 --> 47:39.001
music makes me feel a little
better, so I thought maybe...

47:39.102 --> 47:40.626
Oh, it's a
cheer-me-up thing?

47:40.737 --> 47:41.897
I was gonna just
put it on your iPod.

47:42.005 --> 47:43.267
I don't have to
play it right now.

47:43.373 --> 47:45.204
For what? For when I go out
jogging? I don't need to...

47:45.308 --> 47:48.937
Let me hear it. I don't jog
anymore. Let me hear my playlist.

47:57.253 --> 48:00.313
Ira! Ira!

48:01.324 --> 48:03.155
Okay, you don't have
to make fun of it.

48:03.259 --> 48:05.022
No, Bob Marley!

48:05.128 --> 48:08.825
Yes. Everything is gonna be all right.
You're right, Ira.

48:08.932 --> 48:11.958
Bob Marley had cancer.
Everything wasn't all right for Bob Marley.

48:12.068 --> 48:13.399
He dead now.

48:13.503 --> 48:14.936
What else
you put on there for me?

48:15.038 --> 48:16.437
I really don't want
to do this, George.

48:16.539 --> 48:17.972
Can we just... I'll...
Just forget I did this.

48:18.074 --> 48:19.473
Ignore it.
I'll erase it, okay?

48:19.576 --> 48:23.535
No, no, no, don't do that. Let's hear
what's gonna cheer me up! This is good.

48:23.646 --> 48:25.136
Come on. What else you got?

48:25.248 --> 48:26.579
Okay, here's the next one.

48:27.750 --> 48:33.245
<i>Now I've had</i>
<i>the time of my life</i>

48:33.356 --> 48:36.154
<i>No, I never felt</i>
<i>like this before</i>

48:36.259 --> 48:37.658
I don't know what
to say to that one.

48:37.760 --> 48:41.355
That's... That's just...
That's just fifth grade and...

48:41.931 --> 48:44.900
Showing me your cock was embarrassing,
but this is okay?

48:45.001 --> 48:46.798
Oh, God.
That's a good song.

48:46.903 --> 48:50.066
Yeah, what else?
Give me more. This is... This is unbelievable.

48:50.173 --> 48:51.868
You sure you want
to hear another one?

48:51.975 --> 48:52.964
I don't...
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

48:53.076 --> 48:55.044
This is fun to be cheered up.

48:55.144 --> 48:56.133
I'm sorry...

49:01.317 --> 49:05.686
<i> Shadows are falling</i>
<i>And I'm running out of breath</i>

49:06.823 --> 49:09.792
<i>Keep me in your heart</i>
<i>for a while</i>

49:11.594 --> 49:16.361
<i>If I leave you, it doesn't
mean I love you any less</i>

49:17.634 --> 49:20.694
<i>Keep me in your heart</i>
<i>for a while</i>

49:22.372 --> 49:27.400
<i>When you get up in the morning</i>
<i>And you see that crazy sun</i>

49:28.411 --> 49:31.403
<i>Keep me in your heart</i>
<i>for a while</i>

49:33.383 --> 49:36.318
Just write me some jokes,
you stupid, fucking idiot.

49:36.419 --> 49:37.977
Okay, I'm sorry.

49:39.188 --> 49:42.180
<i>Keep me in your heart</i>
<i>for a while</i>

49:43.426 --> 49:45.792
<i>So, I'm not married.</i>
<i>I don't think I'm ever gonna get married.</i>

49:45.895 --> 49:47.920
<i>I just... I can't find</i>
<i>a reason to do it, you know?</i>

49:48.031 --> 49:49.430
<i>Like, I got friends, like,</i>

49:49.532 --> 49:51.329
<i>" You gotta get married.</i>
<i>My wife.</i>

49:51.501 --> 49:53.332
<i>" My wife is a...</i>
<i>She's the best cook.</i>

49:53.436 --> 49:54.664
<i>"My wife's the... You gotta."</i>

49:54.771 --> 49:57.137
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"My cook's the best cook."</i>

49:59.475 --> 50:01.534
<i>" But my wife,</i>
<i>she's my best friend. "</i>

50:02.412 --> 50:04.710
<i>" Yeah, my cook's actually</i>
<i>a pretty good guy. " You know?</i>

50:05.648 --> 50:07.479
This could be funny.

50:07.583 --> 50:11.417
Like, your dad didn't like you, so
he named you and your dog George.

50:11.521 --> 50:13.512
<i>He'd be like,</i>
<i>"Hey, George, come in here!</i>

50:13.923 --> 50:15.618
<i>"Not you, the dog."</i>

50:16.159 --> 50:18.525
"George, I... Look at this
awesome book I just got!"

50:18.628 --> 50:20.118
And then you come in, it's like,
"Not you, the dog."

50:20.229 --> 50:21.218
That's funny.
- Yeah.

50:21.331 --> 50:23.925
<i>" Hey, George, I made a nice steak for you. "
<i>- "Hey, thanks, Dad."</i></i>

50:24.033 --> 50:25.967
<i>"Not you, the dog."</i>

50:26.069 --> 50:27.969
<i>" Hey, George, I just put some peanut
butter on my balls. Come lick it up. You. "</i>

50:32.239 --> 50:33.706
<i>Fuck him.</i>

50:33.807 --> 50:39.143
<i>I miss the dry hump as a concept
in my life. It just doesn't...</i>

50:39.246 --> 50:43.080
<i>I miss the dry hump 'cause you don't
need a big dick to be a good dry humper.</i>

50:43.183 --> 50:46.175
<i>You just need a big thigh,</i>
<i>that's all you need.</i>

50:46.287 --> 50:49.222
<i>Be able to get your thigh</i>
<i>in there real good.</i>

50:49.323 --> 50:52.190
<i>I can thigh</i>
<i>the hell out of a girl.</i>

50:52.293 --> 50:56.389
<i>Sexually, I'm completely terrible,
but I could do this all day.</i>

50:57.097 --> 51:02.034
<i>I'm very rich, by the way. I know that
makes you fee good about your life.</i>

51:02.136 --> 51:03.296
<i>I got so much.</i>

51:03.404 --> 51:06.032
<i>"You have so much. Why not me?"</i>

51:06.140 --> 51:08.870
<i>I have people stop m on the
streets sometimes, just go,</i>

51:08.976 --> 51:13.072
<i>"You have so much!"</i>
<i>"Yes, yes." "Why not me?"</i>

51:13.180 --> 51:14.147
<i>Like, "I don't know."</i>

51:14.248 --> 51:19.015
<i>"Why you? I came out
here to do what you do. "</i>

51:19.119 --> 51:20.086
<i>"Well, you're not doing it."</i>

51:20.187 --> 51:22.018
<i>" No, I'm not!</i>

51:22.122 --> 51:25.956
<i>" Fuck you!</i>
<i>I want all your money and all your whores. "</i>

51:27.094 --> 51:29.085
<i>Airplanes are</i>
<i>the last public place</i>

51:29.196 --> 51:31.664
<i>where you can fart as loud

51:32.099 --> 51:34.033
<i>'Cause they don't... It's loud.</i>
<i>There's engine noise.</i>

51:34.134 --> 51:35.123
<i>They just don't</i>
<i>know it's you.</i>

51:35.235 --> 51:37.863

<i>and be sitting this</i>
<i>far away from them</i>

51:46.747 --> 51:49.181
<i>" Yeah? Where's</i>
<i>your grandson from?"</i>

51:49.283 --> 51:52.013
<i>My asshole's been open this whole time.</i>
<i>It's just still...</i>

51:54.221 --> 51:57.987
Hey, can you help me with some of my
jokes when I... When I drop you off later?

51:58.092 --> 51:59.491
Help you with some of your bits?
- Yeah.

51:59.593 --> 52:01.527
No. I'm not gonna help you, man.

52:01.628 --> 52:04.028
No one helped me when I started.

52:04.131 --> 52:06.429
Fucking, I'm not paying to help
you, I'm paying you to help me.

52:06.533 --> 52:08.398
No, okay.
You're right, you're right.

52:08.502 --> 52:12.097
<i>There is always the one girl out
there, though. The one that got away.</i>

52:12.206 --> 52:17.109
<i>Guys have that and serial killers
have that. The one that got away.</i>

52:17.211 --> 52:22.376
<i>" I had her, the trunk was
lined with garbage bags</i>

52:22.483 --> 52:24.383
<i>"and then she got away."</i>

52:26.353 --> 52:28.753
<i>I'm sick of rap songs</i>
<i>telling me what to do.</i>

52:30.124 --> 52:33.423
<i>" Bend over. Slap your ass, girl.</i>
<i>Drop it like it's hot. "</i>

52:35.221 --> 52:36.347
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna</i>
<i>write a song back.</i>

52:36.455 --> 52:40.858
<i>I'm gonna be, like,</i>
<i>"Boy, brush your teeth!</i>

52:40.960 --> 52:46.330
<i>" Yeah, boy, bump that jacket off
your back. I'm fucking cold as shit!"</i>

52:47.767 --> 52:49.132
<i>I masturbate so much</i>
<i>with hand cream,</i>

52:49.235 --> 52:52.830
<i>I forget people use it for
shit other than masturbating.</i>

52:52.939 --> 52:55.134
<i>Literally when I'm in public and
I see someone pull out hand cream,</i>

52:55.241 --> 52:57.971
<i>I'm like, " This guy's</i>
<i>about to jerk off!"</i>

52:58.177 --> 52:59.201
Can I ask you something?

52:59.312 --> 53:03.544
Is your act just designed to make sure
no girl will ever sleep with you again?

53:03.649 --> 53:06.846
All you fucking talk about
is jacking off and farting.

53:06.953 --> 53:08.648
You think a girl's gonna
come up to you after the show,

53:09.055 --> 53:11.922
"Could you just jack off for
me and then fart in my face?"

53:12.024 --> 53:14.925
It's fucking insane!
Do you want to get laid, ever?

53:24.570 --> 53:29.473
<i> How will you</i>
<i>people live without me?</i>

53:31.043 --> 53:35.742
<i>Who will bring you joy</i>
<i>when I'm gone?</i>

53:37.717 --> 53:41.710
<i>'Cause I'm one funny man</i>

53:42.021 --> 53:45.149
<i>I bring the comedy</i>

53:45.258 --> 53:50.025
<i>I am the one you go to,</i>
<i>to get cheered up</i>

53:52.198 --> 53:55.895
<i>Put in my movies</i>

53:56.002 --> 54:02.134
<i>Escape, if you will</i>
<i>To a land of loveliness</i>

54:05.144 --> 54:08.113
<i>He doesn't have patience</i>

54:08.214 --> 54:14.642
<i>He hates so many people</i>
<i>He's mad when others do well</i>

54:14.920 --> 54:21.223
<i>He hates himself</i>
<i>Fuck George Simmons</i>

54:21.661 --> 54:24.858
<i>He has a medium-sized penis</i>

54:24.964 --> 54:29.833
<i>He fucked so many girls</i>
<i>And yet no one remembers</i>

54:30.303 --> 54:33.397
<i>When he's done fucking them</i>

54:33.639 --> 54:37.040
<i>The girl just</i>
<i>lays there and says</i>

54:37.143 --> 54:42.046
<i>I should have fucked
Jean-Claude Van Damme instead of you</i>

54:42.982 --> 54:48.045
<i>Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah!</i>

54:49.722 --> 54:54.182
<i>George Simmons</i>
<i>soon will be gone</i>

54:57.296 --> 55:00.561
<i>And he will not</i>
<i>miss you people at all.</i>

55:02.034 --> 55:05.492
<i>Our relationship has</i>
<i>always been strained.</i>

55:05.604 --> 55:10.473
<i>You always wanted too much
from me, and I'm very mad at you.</i>

55:11.377 --> 55:15.871
<i>Leave me alone.</i>
<i>Don't visit my grave, cocksuckers.</i>

55:17.450 --> 55:18.576
<i>Peace!</i>

55:32.531 --> 55:33.998
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>it's George Simmons!</i>

55:34.900 --> 55:37.425
What are you doing here?
What's happening?

55:37.536 --> 55:41.304
I couldn't sleep.
I want to get the Cavaliers game.

55:41.407 --> 55:42.999
I can't get this
thing ever to work.

55:43.109 --> 55:47.273
I was up all night, man. I had a
terrible sleep. I was sweating my ass off.

55:47.380 --> 55:49.848
I'm fucking hot one second
and cold one second

55:49.949 --> 55:52.816
and the <i>alc</i>
don't work for shit.

55:52.918 --> 55:55.944
It's always going
up to the roof.

55:56.055 --> 55:57.249
What time is it?

55:57.356 --> 55:58.846
It says 3:00.

55:59.692 --> 56:04.288
It's 3:00? God damn it!
I can't fucking waste time. I gotta...

56:06.599 --> 56:09.090
All right,
let's start my goddamn day.

56:10.069 --> 56:11.502
I don't got time for this shit.

56:11.604 --> 56:14.198
Let me have that
stupid clicker. Come on.

56:16.742 --> 56:18.937
They keep telling me that
I gotta dial an extension.

56:19.044 --> 56:22.912
I don't even have the fucking number
to dial for the fucking extension!

56:23.015 --> 56:24.039
Do you want me
to try calling them?

56:24.283 --> 56:25.750
You should have
fucking called them!

56:25.851 --> 56:28.081
Where the fuck
were you last night?

56:28.454 --> 56:29.478
You'll call them.

56:29.588 --> 56:30.987
I'm sorry, man.

56:31.090 --> 56:32.751
Just tell me what you need,
I'll get it done, okay?

56:32.858 --> 56:35.918
You pay for all of this stuff
and none of it ever works!

56:36.028 --> 56:38.895
Nothing!
I don't even think I'm sick!

56:38.998 --> 56:41.831
These guys are trying
to fucking kill me!

56:42.601 --> 56:45.832
I want to go to the doctor.
I gotta see this guy.

56:45.938 --> 56:48.304
What the fuck is happening?

56:49.809 --> 56:53.142
This medicine does not work.
It makes it worse!

56:53.245 --> 56:55.338
Okay. I'll call them right now.
I'll tell them we're coming, okay?

56:55.448 --> 56:57.040
Now. We gotta go now.

56:57.149 --> 56:58.241
I'll call them
right now, okay?

56:58.350 --> 57:00.250
Yeah.
I'll meet you downstairs.

57:08.894 --> 57:13.456
Please put away the video game.
Don't do that. Don't be rude.

57:13.566 --> 57:14.533
I'm sorry.

57:14.633 --> 57:15.600
Fucking playing <i>Centipede?</i>

57:15.701 --> 57:17.032
What the fuck were you playing?

57:17.136 --> 57:18.899
Just a driving game.

57:20.539 --> 57:21.528
Hello, Mr. Simmons.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.607
Hey, yeah, Doctor, good to see you.

57:22.708 --> 57:23.766
How are you?
I brought my friend.

57:23.876 --> 57:28.006
This is my... Well, my lover,
my life partner, my everything.

57:28.113 --> 57:30.638
How are you? What's
going on? How we doing?

57:30.749 --> 57:33.809
Well, your immune system is in the
middle of a very serious battle.

57:34.386 --> 57:36.251
The medicine is trying
to combat the disease,

57:36.355 --> 57:38.755
but in the process
it destroys healthy tissue

57:38.858 --> 57:41.156
and disrupts healthy
functioning of your organs

57:41.260 --> 57:43.728
and multiple
lymphatic systems,

57:43.829 --> 57:45.956
so you're getting
attacked on two levels.

57:46.298 --> 57:48.232
And we hope the disease
is vanquished

57:48.334 --> 57:51.235
before it and the medicine does
damage which cannot be contained.

57:51.670 --> 57:53.262
Okay.

57:53.372 --> 57:54.999
Your accent is very thick.

57:56.542 --> 57:57.839
You ever notice your accent

57:57.943 --> 58:01.470
makes things sound worse than they...
Than they actually are?

58:01.981 --> 58:04.176
You could give good news,
and I'd still be like,

58:04.283 --> 58:05.978
"What happened?
Am I still dying?"

58:06.919 --> 58:08.352
I'm just trying to help you.

58:08.754 --> 58:11.052
I know you sound like a
regular Joe where you come from,

58:11.156 --> 58:17.026
but here I keep thinking you're
gonna be torturing James Bond later.

58:17.129 --> 58:21.031
I'm sure your sense of humor will
serve you well in this situation.

58:21.433 --> 58:26.029
There he goes again. All so terrifying
because it came out of your mouth.

58:26.539 --> 58:28.370
You are a very funny man.

58:28.474 --> 58:30.738
Are you mad that you died
at the end of <i>Die Hard?</i>

58:31.176 --> 58:33.610
I don't understand
the reference.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.241
He kind of looks like those two guys
in the second <i>Matrix</i> movie.

58:38.851 --> 58:40.978
I assure you I was
not in <i>The Matrix.</i>

58:41.086 --> 58:44.112
Why did you eat Björn Borg?
What did he do to you?

58:44.223 --> 58:47.989
If you have no other questions,
I do have other patients.

58:48.093 --> 58:52.029
You have other patients that you have
to frighten by the end of the day?

58:52.131 --> 58:53.598
How many patients
do you frighten a day?

58:53.699 --> 58:56.566
And I am slowly getting
a little bit annoyed

58:56.669 --> 59:00.366
by these humorous
activities from you guys.

59:01.173 --> 59:02.140
So, I think you and...

59:02.241 --> 59:03.765
We have discussed
this and I am very,

59:03.876 --> 59:06.310
very sympathetic
to your recovery,

59:06.545 --> 59:09.946
and I hope we will succeed
with what we are doing.

59:10.049 --> 59:12.574
I've been trying to build this
cabinet I bought from you guys

59:12.685 --> 59:14.846
for, like, six months
and I gotta...

59:14.954 --> 59:16.819
IKEA? That's very funny.

59:27.232 --> 59:29.132
Hey. Yo, Teach.
- Hey.

59:30.936 --> 59:32.631
How's... How was the taping?

59:32.738 --> 59:35.502
Great. Great, yeah.
I'm happy with it.

59:35.608 --> 59:37.200
I think the ending
really murdered.

59:37.309 --> 59:40.107
Was it a very
special episode?

59:41.814 --> 59:44.248
You remember
Daisy, right?

59:44.350 --> 59:45.578
Yeah, of course.

59:46.085 --> 59:47.109
Hey.

59:47.219 --> 59:48.481
I'm sorry.

59:48.587 --> 59:50.214
I didn't know you'd
be coming home tonight.

59:50.322 --> 59:53.018
I thought maybe you'd be spending
the night at George's and...

59:53.125 --> 59:57.061
Guess it's been
more than 10 days, huh?

59:57.162 --> 01:00:00.723
Yeah,
I gave you an extra 11.

01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:01.959
What are you guys
talking about?

01:00:02.067 --> 01:00:03.898
Nothing. Doesn't matter.
It's cool.

01:00:04.003 --> 01:00:06.164
Don't give a shit.
Totally fine.

01:00:11.076 --> 01:00:13.271
Hey. I saw the new
<i>Harry Potter</i> movie.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.969
Harry's getting old.

01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:17.048
He's, like, older than my dad.

01:00:17.149 --> 01:00:18.616
They should call
him Harold Potter.

01:00:19.485 --> 01:00:21.578
That Hermione's got
some big, old titties.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:26.685
Whoa!

01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:30.728
Did you two just bone?
I'm getting a little vibe here.

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:33.730
This is exciting.
Think I'm getting a quarter chub.

01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:36.665
Why is Ira so upset?

01:00:36.769 --> 01:00:39.135
It's been, like, way after 10 days.

01:00:39.238 --> 01:00:42.298
He can't call dibs
on every girl he meets.

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:45.166
We were supposed to go out
on a date together.

01:00:45.277 --> 01:00:47.905
We are going out on a date.
- I thought so.

01:00:48.013 --> 01:00:49.173
We're not anymore! No!

01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:50.270
Really?

01:00:50.382 --> 01:00:54.478
'Cause after you fuck my roommate
that kind of ends it with me!

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.588
What are you talking about?
Don't treat me like that.

01:00:57.089 --> 01:01:00.286
Just so you know how I'm
seeing you? You're a starfucker.

01:01:00.392 --> 01:01:02.690
You're a girl who met
a star and then fucked him.

01:01:02.795 --> 01:01:04.456
And he's not even
that famous!

01:01:04.563 --> 01:01:07.726
What if like a real good-looking
celebrity was my roommate?

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:11.792
What if I lived with, you know,
James McAvoy or Jude Law or something?

01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:14.635
I don't know. I probably would
fuck both of those people.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.707
Don't say that.

01:01:15.808 --> 01:01:17.400
I'm sorry!
Lower the bar a little bit.

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:19.200
I can't believe that!

01:01:20.913 --> 01:01:26.146
If a hot girl walked over here, naked,
and was like, "Do my body," you would.

01:01:26.285 --> 01:01:27.650
You would have sex with her.

01:01:27.753 --> 01:01:30.119
No, I'd feel really uncomfortable.

01:01:30.255 --> 01:01:32.553
And then I might ask
her to a Wilco show.

01:01:32.658 --> 01:01:37.027
Okay, then you're the first guy in the
world that I've ever met that's like that.

01:01:37.529 --> 01:01:40.089
I thought you were the kind of
girl that would wait two months

01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:41.223
and then have
sex with a guy.

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:42.300
I didn't think
you would just...

01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:44.460
I'm an independent woman.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.038
I'm allowed to fuck people.

01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:50.400
Well, if I had known that, I would
have scheduled our date a lot sooner!

01:01:52.111 --> 01:01:54.545
Give me a break.
I don't even know you.

01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:57.682
This is the longest
conversation we've ever had.

01:02:03.555 --> 01:02:08.424
Don't be mad at me.
I said I'd give you 10 days.

01:02:08.527 --> 01:02:10.017
I gave you three weeks.

01:02:13.432 --> 01:02:14.660
I thought you were joking, man.

01:02:14.767 --> 01:02:17.235
I'm gonna be honest with you.

01:02:17.336 --> 01:02:20.134
We... We... We want to fuck
every girl that we meet.

01:02:21.507 --> 01:02:22.474
That's how it works.

01:02:22.574 --> 01:02:25.600
If I didn't sleep with every girl
you wished you could sleep with,

01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:27.303
I wouldn't sleep with anybody.

01:02:27.412 --> 01:02:29.937
It's a communication breakdown.
We can fix this.

01:02:30.482 --> 01:02:32.279
I don't care.
The fact that you had sex with her...

01:02:32.384 --> 01:02:36.718
I can never do anything
like that with her.

01:02:36.822 --> 01:02:41.122
So, you're really not gonna chase
this girl just because I was with her?

01:02:41.226 --> 01:02:42.284
Yeah.

01:02:43.028 --> 01:02:44.086
Huh.

01:02:44.963 --> 01:02:47.090
It's kind of
insulting, on some level.

01:02:49.935 --> 01:02:52.267
Wanna go to Wilco with me?

01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:56.097
I wish I could, but I'm
going with Tobey Maguire.

01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:58.802
I might play his little
brother in this movie.

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.474
I hope I get it.

01:03:10.522 --> 01:03:14.014
Give me something. You didn't get
rid of them. What did you get rid of?

01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:15.855
Well, I, you know,
I got a few good offers,

01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:18.395
but honestly, I don't know how
much each car is worth and I...

01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:20.362
They keep on wanting
to buy all of them

01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:21.864
and it's hard for me to...
Don't make it a big deal.

01:03:21.967 --> 01:03:24.800
Don't get a stomach-ache over it.
Just sell them.

01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:26.097
Give it to a charity.
Move on.

01:03:26.205 --> 01:03:27.172
Okay.

01:03:27.339 --> 01:03:28.533
I just want to be
happy about

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.664
giving something
away, you know.

01:03:29.775 --> 01:03:30.742
Okay.

01:03:30.843 --> 01:03:31.810
So...

01:03:33.445 --> 01:03:36.039
There's something I've really
been wanting to tell you, George.

01:03:36.148 --> 01:03:37.240
Uh-oh.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.278
Yeah.

01:03:39.384 --> 01:03:43.878
I feel as though you need to tell someone
other than me about your condition.

01:03:45.557 --> 01:03:47.024
I don't want to do that.

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:48.558
George, people care about you.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.628
You have to let
them be there for you.

01:03:51.597 --> 01:03:55.397
I tell somebody, then it's all gonna
change, and you can't get it back.

01:03:56.201 --> 01:03:58.032
Everything's already
changed, George,

01:03:58.136 --> 01:04:02.300
and the truth is soon you're
gonna start getting very sick

01:04:02.407 --> 01:04:04.466
and you are gonna want
someone other than me there.

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.205
I mean, have you...
Have you even told your parents yet?

01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:09.405
My parents are in their mid-70s.

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:12.176
They would drop dead
if they heard about this.

01:04:12.284 --> 01:04:14.081
Friends. You must want
to tell your friends.

01:04:14.186 --> 01:04:16.211
I don't really
have any friends.

01:04:16.321 --> 01:04:18.619
I have people I shoot the
shit with and fuck around with,

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.521
but there's nobody
I'm really close with.

01:04:20.626 --> 01:04:22.059
I've got showbiz friends.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.596
Andy Dick isn't a friend.
He's just a guy you know.

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:28.165
You're my closest friend,
and I don't even like you.

01:04:29.368 --> 01:04:31.427
You have to tell someone
other than me, man.

01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:33.197
I can't be the only one who knows.

01:04:33.305 --> 01:04:34.738
I've never dealt
with anything like this.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.206
All my grandparents are alive.

01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:40.676
Listen, this is not your job to cry.
Your job is to not cry.

01:04:40.779 --> 01:04:43.714
I'm just trying to talk
to you man-to-man, George.

01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:45.817
As a man, you are
crying right now.

01:04:45.918 --> 01:04:46.907
I'm not crying.

01:04:47.019 --> 01:04:49.283
People are gonna think we just
broke up or something, Ira.

01:04:49.388 --> 01:04:51.049
Stop doing what you're doing.

01:04:51.156 --> 01:04:52.145
Okay, I'll stop.

01:04:52.257 --> 01:04:56.159
You're causing a scene.
You're making crazy faces now, Ira.

01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:59.253
Open your eyes.
Stop crying.

01:05:00.465 --> 01:05:02.865
You're making noises now?
You look like the Incredible Hulk.

01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:05.934
Jesus, you're
spitting on my shrimp,

01:05:06.038 --> 01:05:07.437
you asshole.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:08.807 --> 01:05:09.774
God, I'm sorry.

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:10.864
Come on.
Wipe it off.

01:05:11.677 --> 01:05:13.235
Jesus Christ.

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:16.544
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

01:05:16.648 --> 01:05:17.945
This is the worst.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.518
Why didn't I just get hit
by a fucking foul ball?

01:05:21.586 --> 01:05:23.645
You ruined The Palm,
you fucking ass.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:29.124
This could have been
the best meal, ever.

01:05:30.295 --> 01:05:31.728
Should I get you
ice chips or something?

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:33.661
No, I'm good.

01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:35.798
You never had any kids, huh?

01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:37.425
No. No.
We didn't get to that.

01:05:37.536 --> 01:05:39.026
I have three.

01:05:39.137 --> 01:05:40.104
I know.

01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:42.298
Three kids to carry
on the Dick legacy.

01:05:42.407 --> 01:05:46.571
How the hell did you have any kids
with all the penises you've blown?

01:05:46.678 --> 01:05:50.307
I sucked my own dick and
spit it into their vagina.

01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:54.681
I mean, knowing that. Most people
just go through life asleep anyways.

01:05:54.786 --> 01:05:56.879
Some of those people don't even
wake up until they get, you know,

01:05:56.989 --> 01:05:58.354
the Dr. Death call, you know.

01:05:58.457 --> 01:06:01.255
"This is Dr. Death! You're going to die."

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.225
"Don't be afraid, George.

01:06:03.328 --> 01:06:08.129
"It's just Death calling.
Cheer up, motherfucker!"

01:06:08.734 --> 01:06:10.258
Yeah. Fuck negativity.

01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:12.963
Fuck it in the ass
with a Chinese monkey!

01:06:13.905 --> 01:06:15.896
I wish I wasn't so fucking
angry with you right now.

01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:18.939
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I wasn't a good brother.

01:06:19.044 --> 01:06:20.409
You were a terrible brother.

01:06:20.512 --> 01:06:21.911
You just left us and
you didn't care.

01:06:22.014 --> 01:06:23.914
You didn't give a shit about us.

01:06:24.016 --> 01:06:25.881
You don't even give a...
You moved to Kansas.

01:06:25.984 --> 01:06:27.918
Am I supposed to visit you in Kansas?
- Yes.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.511
I thought that's why you moved
there, so you didn't get visitors.

01:06:30.622 --> 01:06:31.953
You're so fucking selfish.

01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:33.046
I know.

01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:36.251
You've only seen my son,
like, three times.

01:06:36.361 --> 01:06:39.159
I send him fucking
DVDs all the time.

01:06:39.264 --> 01:06:41.255
He doesn't want your DVDs.

01:06:41.366 --> 01:06:42.924
He wants you to be
a part of his life.

01:06:43.035 --> 01:06:45.026
He wants to be a part of yours.

01:06:45.137 --> 01:06:47.571
Wow. This has been great.

01:06:47.672 --> 01:06:51.506
I want to call Dad now and
just have more family time.

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.679
What did we ever do to you?
I'm not Dad.

01:06:57.049 --> 01:06:59.381
You are right.

01:06:59.484 --> 01:07:03.648
You're very, very nice, and
I'm sorry I don't know your son.

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:06.724
I'm sorry I don't
know you anymore.

01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:09.019
I'm glad you
don't know me.

01:07:09.127 --> 01:07:10.219
I wish I did.

01:07:11.763 --> 01:07:14.630
You'd be let down,
believe me.

01:07:22.774 --> 01:07:24.571
Oh, man.

01:07:30.515 --> 01:07:32.005
Oh, God.

01:07:35.187 --> 01:07:36.779
Who's that?

01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:38.788
That's the girl
I was gonna marry...

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:42.320
...but then she smartened up.

01:07:43.195 --> 01:07:45.629
So, she's 10 and she's six.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.096
So cute.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.259
Jeez, she looks like you,
the little one, huh?

01:07:50.368 --> 01:07:51.357
Yeah.

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.303
What's the matter?
Your guy doesn't have any DNA in him?

01:07:54.406 --> 01:07:56.966
That's all Laura.

01:07:57.142 --> 01:07:58.871
They fight a lot,
but they're cute.

01:07:59.377 --> 01:08:03.143
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming here.

01:08:03.715 --> 01:08:04.977
I wanted to come.
I wanted to see you.

01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:06.277
You didn't have
to come here.

01:08:06.384 --> 01:08:09.080
You didn't have to.
I know it's stressful for you.

01:08:09.521 --> 01:08:11.921
I'm just... I'm just...
I'm so sorry.

01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:14.755
I'm so sorry about
everything I did.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.022
You don't have to be sorry.
That was 12 years ago.

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:19.961
Everything worked out
for the best.

01:08:20.064 --> 01:08:22.225
It's good. Look at your
life. This is great.

01:08:22.634 --> 01:08:28.197
Yes. It's the best life.
I hate it. I hate it all.

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:29.466
I haven't been...
You don't hate it.

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:32.475
I'm addicted to it, I guess.
I keep doing it.

01:08:32.911 --> 01:08:35.812
Hello, Wayne. This is Ira.
I'm calling to say

01:08:35.913 --> 01:08:39.077
I don't think today is a good day
for you to come by and see George.

01:08:39.384 --> 01:08:42.410
Maybe tomorrow. So, I'll give you a call
when I know what the schedule looks like.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.785
Thank you.
I'll talk to you soon.

01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:48.386
You have a family now.
You have a family now.

01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:51.256
I'm so happy. You did the
right thing. You moved on.

01:08:51.363 --> 01:08:53.456
You got a good life.

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:56.693
And... And I just got
nothing, Laura. I hate that.

01:08:56.801 --> 01:08:59.361
I hate that it could
have been me with you.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:00.631
Don't do that, please?

01:09:00.738 --> 01:09:02.366
I'm sorry. I just fucking...

01:09:02.474 --> 01:09:04.840
You... I could have
had those kids with you.

01:09:05.844 --> 01:09:09.473
How could you cheat on me?
I was so hot.

01:09:09.581 --> 01:09:11.104
You were. You were
so hot. I don't know.

01:09:11.216 --> 01:09:12.513
I was hot!

01:09:12.617 --> 01:09:15.484
I don't even know what
the fuck I was doing.

01:09:15.587 --> 01:09:20.115
I was just a stupid idiot.
I don't remember anybody else.

01:09:20.225 --> 01:09:21.817
What was wrong with you?
I don't remember anybody else.

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:23.587
I only remember you.
I don't know.

01:09:23.694 --> 01:09:26.630
I don't even know who they were,
who fucking ruined us.

01:09:26.731 --> 01:09:29.928
They're not in my brain, ever.
It's like it didn't happen.

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:31.899
The only thing
that happened was us.

01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:34.698
And you ran away
'cause you had to.

01:09:34.805 --> 01:09:36.603
I had to go.

01:09:36.707 --> 01:09:39.939
At the time, I just
couldn't do it anymore.

01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:42.240
Yeah.
But you know what I realized?

01:09:42.346 --> 01:09:43.974
I love my husband,

01:09:45.383 --> 01:09:48.045
but it's just not the same.

01:09:49.087 --> 01:09:52.716
And I loved you
so much and...

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:56.453
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

01:09:56.561 --> 01:09:59.792
I have the same thing.
I have the same thing.

01:09:59.898 --> 01:10:02.492
Don't feel bad.
Don't feel bad.

01:10:02.634 --> 01:10:05.762
I love you. I love you.
I always loved you.

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.362
And the crazy thing is
he cheats on me, too.

01:10:09.474 --> 01:10:10.441
I hate...

01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:12.203
He's like an Australian you.

01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:16.913
I fucking hate this guy.
Is he crazy?

01:10:17.015 --> 01:10:20.212
It's just that
you were the one.

01:10:20.318 --> 01:10:25.654
Just you are...
Were... Are the love...

01:10:28.526 --> 01:10:32.360
Love of my life.
And I just love you.

01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:43.271
Yeah, the hug was a
mistake, wasn't it?

01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:48.738
You're not sick, are you?

01:10:48.847 --> 01:10:51.907
You're just doing that
to get me down here, huh?

01:10:54.853 --> 01:10:56.377
There are those
hands again.

01:10:56.488 --> 01:10:57.955
My big hands.

01:10:58.089 --> 01:10:59.954
Always made
my penis look small.

01:11:01.159 --> 01:11:03.650
Thank you, hands,
for that complex.

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:08.164
Yes. Jeez.

01:11:08.266 --> 01:11:13.738
The two of them together,
it was a guaranteed dwarfing.

01:11:13.739 --> 01:11:14.227
Okay.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.038
Yeah.

01:11:25.183 --> 01:11:26.810
That was worth it.

01:11:27.252 --> 01:11:29.152
<i>We're into overtime now,</i>
<i>just so you know.</i>

01:11:29.254 --> 01:11:31.119
<i> Jeez,</i>
<i>that came quick.</i>

01:11:31.222 --> 01:11:33.190
<i>I wish that you guys</i>
<i>were really my friends</i>

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.919
<i>and I didn't have to
pay you to jam with me.</i>

01:11:37.429 --> 01:11:40.398
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so let's keep going then.</i>

01:11:53.645 --> 01:11:57.274
<i> All my little</i>
<i>plans and schemes</i>

01:11:59.351 --> 01:12:03.617
<i>Lost like some</i>
<i>forgotten dream</i>

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:06.284
<i>Seems like all I...</i>

01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:08.018
Diego.
- Yes, George?

01:12:08.126 --> 01:12:09.855
The roses look terrific.

01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:11.553
Thank you.
They sure look beautiful.

01:12:11.663 --> 01:12:15.292
Only a guy with a big cock like
you could make roses this beautiful.

01:12:16.735 --> 01:12:20.501
<i>Don't need to be alone</i>

01:12:22.574 --> 01:12:26.340
<i>No need to be alone</i>

01:12:29.381 --> 01:12:34.614
<i>It's real love</i>
<i>It's real</i>

01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:37.085
<i>Yes, it's real love</i>

01:12:37.188 --> 01:12:38.655
You doing stand-up at all?

01:12:38.757 --> 01:12:41.248
This is actually the first time
I've left the house in three years.

01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:42.849
But I will sometimes,
in my house,

01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:45.087
in front of my kids,
I'll do five, six minutes.

01:12:45.196 --> 01:12:47.562
Not good stuff. It's a lot
of "Where you from?" You know.

01:12:47.665 --> 01:12:48.893
But, you know,
all kidding aside,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.331
I know you're in a
terrible situation,

01:12:50.435 --> 01:12:53.029
but even with that, you
look so much better than him.

01:12:57.542 --> 01:13:01.808
<i> The Kingdom</i>
<i>of Heaven is, is in your hands</i>

01:13:02.947 --> 01:13:07.543
<i>I don't expect for you
to awake from your dreams</i>

01:13:07.652 --> 01:13:09.552
We watched your
last movie on video.

01:13:09.888 --> 01:13:12.254
A man who is funny
doesn't have to work blue.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:14.585
You don't... You don't have
to do trash to be funny.

01:13:14.692 --> 01:13:16.091
I'll tell you who was
a great comedian.

01:13:16.194 --> 01:13:17.559
Please say me. Who?

01:13:17.662 --> 01:13:18.629
Jackie Gleason.

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:19.856
Yeah, of course.

01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:22.057
You like him 'cause you
look like Art Carney.

01:13:24.936 --> 01:13:28.030
Gleason was terrific.
And you ain't so bad.

01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:30.107
All right. Thank you, Pop. I know.

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:31.835
<i> It's real</i>

01:13:31.976 --> 01:13:35.503
<i>It's real love, oh, yeah</i>

01:13:37.315 --> 01:13:42.048
<i>It's real love, yeah</i>

01:13:43.054 --> 01:13:48.253
<i>It's real love</i>
<i>It's real</i>

01:13:52.464 --> 01:13:55.228
I think I played it all wrong, Ira.

01:13:56.468 --> 01:13:58.299
I played it all wrong.

01:14:04.242 --> 01:14:07.234
Okay. He's here. We saw each other.
- Let me answer it. Mark.

01:14:07.345 --> 01:14:09.506
Stop. Let me answer it.
Mark, man.

01:14:10.048 --> 01:14:11.481
Move, bitch!

01:14:11.583 --> 01:14:12.641
Hey, George Simmons. Hey.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.115
Hey, what's up?

01:14:14.219 --> 01:14:15.709
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hey!

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.185
Mark.
Leo is the name I got.

01:14:17.322 --> 01:14:18.789
How are you?
- Yeah, yeah. <i>Yo Teach!</i>

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.824
That's right!
- Yeah, right.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:22.759
Oh, boy.

01:14:22.894 --> 01:14:26.193
That movie's the best 'cause
you're a man then you're a baby

01:14:26.297 --> 01:14:28.925
and then you learn to be a
man once you be... You need...

01:14:29.033 --> 01:14:31.297
It takes becoming a baby
to learn how to become a man.

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:34.700
Yeah. Can we get you
a drink or some food?

01:14:34.806 --> 01:14:37.138
No, no, no. Let me just walk
around and go through your shit.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.702
Hey, I'm Bo.

01:14:40.812 --> 01:14:42.245
What's up, Bo?
I'm an actor, so...

01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:45.145
Oh, good, good, good,
good, good, good.

01:14:46.951 --> 01:14:47.975
I've seen your act a lot.

01:14:48.086 --> 01:14:49.246
Really? Where?

01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:53.484
Schmira, he has that... What's that,
the YouTubey thing that, that...

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:54.780
- The YouTube.
- Yeah.

01:14:54.893 --> 01:14:57.657
George and Daisy are here?
How the hell did that happen?

01:14:57.829 --> 01:15:00.161
I didn't think George would
come, and who invited Daisy?

01:15:00.265 --> 01:15:01.391
I invited her.

01:15:01.499 --> 01:15:03.023
Are you still sleeping with Daisy?

01:15:03.134 --> 01:15:04.601
No, I'm not sleeping with Daisy!

01:15:04.736 --> 01:15:07.967
I have a new girlfriend now.
I'm dating the girl who plays Mrs. Pruitt.

01:15:08.072 --> 01:15:09.061
Her name's Carla something.

01:15:11.165 --> 01:15:12.996
Can I sit next to George at dinner?

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.034
Sit wherever the hell
you want to sit, man, why?

01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:18.161
I feel like if I can just
make George crack up once,

01:15:18.572 --> 01:15:19.971
it'll do huge
things for me, like...

01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:21.336
What, you wrote
jokes for Thanksgiving?

01:15:21.442 --> 01:15:22.568
I didn't write jokes.

01:15:22.676 --> 01:15:24.405
I just wrote down
my funniest anecdotes

01:15:24.512 --> 01:15:25.706
and punched them up
here and there.

01:15:26.213 --> 01:15:30.513
Okay, I can't hide in the
kitchen all afternoon. I'm going.

01:15:31.752 --> 01:15:33.515
My man. The Schmira.

01:15:33.621 --> 01:15:35.054
Thanks for coming, man.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.919
This is the best.
Where's your bedroom?

01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:39.816
Well, get ready for a hike,
'cause you're standing in it.

01:15:39.927 --> 01:15:41.827
No.
It's... Yeah, it's pretty lame.

01:15:41.929 --> 01:15:43.260
Did you go to that Wilco show?

01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:44.353
Yeah, did you?

01:15:44.465 --> 01:15:47.332
No, actually, I didn't.
I scalped the tickets.

01:15:47.802 --> 01:15:48.791
I made 100 bucks profit, so...

01:15:48.903 --> 01:15:49.892
Oh. So, you owe me 50.

01:15:53.356 --> 01:15:55.984
Okay, I guess I do.
Rain check, okay?

01:15:56.092 --> 01:15:57.059
Money order.

01:15:57.226 --> 01:15:58.352
Money order? That'll work.
Yeah.

01:15:58.461 --> 01:16:00.258
PayPal? Are you on PayPal?
Yeah, PayPal it up.

01:16:00.363 --> 01:16:02.923
Look at that, back and
forth, like a cute couple.

01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:05.432
You're like Marc Anthony and J. Lo.

01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:09.464
You know, we actually had a date,
but then I had sex with that guy,

01:16:09.572 --> 01:16:11.005
so Schmira broke it off.

01:16:11.107 --> 01:16:12.096
You kidding me?

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:15.371
Don't worry, Ira. You know you're a
better lover than Pete Rose over there.

01:16:15.478 --> 01:16:17.309
Look at him. He's got
the length and the width.

01:16:17.413 --> 01:16:19.142
Imagine that dong of his.

01:16:19.248 --> 01:16:21.409
I saw the tip of it one time.
Even that was too big for me.

01:16:21.517 --> 01:16:23.178
No, it's very normal.
- Yeah.

01:16:23.285 --> 01:16:24.513
So, you like big penises?

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.180
Well, you know, I have a
really skinny vagina, so...

01:16:27.289 --> 01:16:29.086
If it's skinny, you should
try feeding it carbs.

01:16:30.893 --> 01:16:32.485
Yeah.
All right, well, jeez, you know what?

01:16:32.595 --> 01:16:34.529
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, huh?

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:35.597
Yeah, okay.

01:16:35.698 --> 01:16:36.790
I'm falling in love
with the both of you.

01:16:36.899 --> 01:16:38.127
Let the awkwardness begin!

01:16:38.234 --> 01:16:39.223
Love your work.

01:16:39.335 --> 01:16:42.168
Yeah? Thank you
for shopping at Ralphs.

01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:45.297
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology.
It's really weird what I did.

01:16:45.408 --> 01:16:49.401
I basically yelled at you for cheating on me
before we had even had a real conversation.

01:16:49.545 --> 01:16:52.571
So, I'm aware of that.
I know that's weird, and I'm sorry.

01:16:52.681 --> 01:16:54.478
Well, it's not as weird
as getting drunk

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:57.279
and having sex with the guy
from <i>Yo Teach!</i> So...

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.783
It's okay. When I first moved
here, I blew Mr. Belvedere.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:02.753
So, everyone does that.

01:17:03.159 --> 01:17:04.285
He's walking.
George is walking to us.

01:17:04.393 --> 01:17:06.691
Hello, ladies.

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:10.459
So, Leo? What's the excuse
for not writing me jokes?

01:17:11.133 --> 01:17:12.998
What?
You could have made money.

01:17:13.102 --> 01:17:15.730
I told both you guys to write jokes
for me, and you decided not to.

01:17:15.838 --> 01:17:19.433
What, did you have to go
to LensCrafters that day?

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:22.136
I was just joking.
I like your glasses.

01:17:23.612 --> 01:17:26.740
He wanted both of us to write jokes
for him, and you didn't tell me?

01:17:26.849 --> 01:17:29.545
I apologize. It's not worth,
like, losing your shit over, man.

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:30.744
What, you don't
think I like money?

01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:32.150
You don't think
I like private jets?

01:17:32.254 --> 01:17:35.018
You don't think I want a cool
job writing for George Simmons?

01:17:35.124 --> 01:17:36.148
I just think
you're doing well.

01:17:36.258 --> 01:17:38.886
You know, you're getting gigs
at the lmprov all the time.

01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:40.461
You're gonna have
people writing for you.

01:17:40.563 --> 01:17:43.361
You don't need to be writing
for other people, you know.

01:17:43.466 --> 01:17:44.899
I know, I'm just...
I'm sorry, I just...

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.400
I wanted something for
myself and I just, you know...

01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:50.199
It's just, you know,
fuck you, Ira!

01:17:50.773 --> 01:17:52.263
Just 'cause you go
into faggy-apology mode

01:17:52.374 --> 01:17:54.638
doesn't mean I'm gonna
forgive you right away!

01:17:54.777 --> 01:17:58.838
Fuck you, man. Look, I did the exact same
thing you've been doing this whole time.

01:17:58.948 --> 01:18:00.540
You're being competitive.
You do that all the time.

01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:01.877
I'm doing it now, okay?

01:18:01.984 --> 01:18:03.713
I didn't make it competitive!
- Yes, you did.

01:18:03.819 --> 01:18:05.650
Have you ever had
to work for money? No.

01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:07.312
You didn't work
at a coal mine, Ira!

01:18:07.423 --> 01:18:10.187
You worked at a deli!
Stop crying about it!

01:18:10.326 --> 01:18:12.954
I was only supposed to be on that
pull-out couch for six months!

01:18:13.062 --> 01:18:15.053
And we were supposed to trade!
And we never did!

01:18:15.164 --> 01:18:16.597
Yeah, we never did
switch after six months.

01:18:16.699 --> 01:18:17.666
Yeah. Exactly.

01:18:17.766 --> 01:18:19.256
You know why?
'Cause I pay rent, Ira!

01:18:19.368 --> 01:18:20.801
You don't pay rent.
Your parents pay rent!

01:18:20.903 --> 01:18:22.427
Why don't they move in?
It's your fault.

01:18:22.538 --> 01:18:28.306
Hey, hey, hey. Pilgrims, Indians,
can we please stop fighting?

01:18:28.444 --> 01:18:31.208
It's Thanksgiving. We have
guests inside. Please stop.

01:18:31.313 --> 01:18:34.077
I'm not fighting anymore.
I'm done fighting.

01:18:34.183 --> 01:18:36.083
Thank you.
- You called Daisy a starfucker?

01:18:36.185 --> 01:18:37.618
Why don't you go cup
George Simmons' balls

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.587
while you talk him to
sleep every night, Ira?

01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:42.281
Leo.

01:18:42.691 --> 01:18:43.658
Sorry.

01:18:44.193 --> 01:18:47.720
I would let you do that, too.
My balls are for everybody.

01:18:49.865 --> 01:18:53.460
Okay. It's starting to feel
like Thanksgiving around here.

01:18:54.203 --> 01:18:55.295
Let's eat some food.

01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:03.906
I can't believe you
screwed Daisy, man.

01:19:05.414 --> 01:19:06.472
What?

01:19:07.449 --> 01:19:10.748
So, does anybody want
to say grace or anything?

01:19:10.853 --> 01:19:13.048
Leo's a good writer, apparently.
Come on, get up there.

01:19:13.155 --> 01:19:14.679
Yeah, Leo.

01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:16.155
- Leo!
Do it, Leo.

01:19:16.258 --> 01:19:17.225
I'm okay,
I'm okay.

01:19:17.326 --> 01:19:19.590
All right, let me go.
I'll do it for us.

01:19:19.695 --> 01:19:21.754
Let me get it done.

01:19:21.864 --> 01:19:26.665
Okay, so first let's give thanks
to our families not being here.

01:19:27.836 --> 01:19:30.737
It's always easier, always
easier without the family.

01:19:31.574 --> 01:19:35.442
It's funny, I see you guys and you
are just so much younger than me.

01:19:35.578 --> 01:19:38.809
And I had no idea I was the old
guy until I looked at you guys.

01:19:40.382 --> 01:19:42.543
It was like when I was
growing up, I had a big nose.

01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:45.916
I had no idea until I went to the
Gap and saw a three-way mirror,

01:19:46.021 --> 01:19:48.489
and I was like, "Wow, I
didn't know I had that thing."

01:19:49.692 --> 01:19:53.150
Yeah. No, it's a...
It's good to be young.

01:19:53.262 --> 01:19:55.992
It kind of sucks being old,
so just enjoy this.

01:19:56.098 --> 01:20:00.091
Enjoy time. Time slips
away, I promise you.

01:20:00.202 --> 01:20:03.660
I had a dinner
like this 20 years ago

01:20:03.806 --> 01:20:07.867
with guys that we just, like,
lost touch with each other.

01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:11.174
I never talk to them anymore.
Some of them are dead.

01:20:12.014 --> 01:20:16.383
So, yeah, you don't...
Things slip away.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.946
If you love somebody,
don't let them slip away.

01:20:22.157 --> 01:20:24.022
I swear to you,

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:26.651
this will be your most
memorable Thanksgiving,

01:20:26.795 --> 01:20:29.457
the one that you'll want the rest
of your life, the one that you say,

01:20:29.565 --> 01:20:32.193
"Man, it was never
as good as that night."

01:20:32.301 --> 01:20:36.704
So, let this night be great.
Enjoy the taste of Leo's balls.

01:20:38.507 --> 01:20:39.531
Rock 'n' roll!

01:20:40.843 --> 01:20:44.472
Jesus, every time I'm near you
I feel like fucking Danny DeVito.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.310
Everybody feels like Danny DeVito
when, you know, they walk by me.

01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:48.713
Yeah. You're a giant.

01:20:49.885 --> 01:20:51.512
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, yeah.

01:20:52.154 --> 01:20:53.246
Um...

01:20:53.822 --> 01:20:54.789
I don't want
to get your hopes up.

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:55.879
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:55.991 --> 01:20:59.483
We put you on this experimental
medication without much optimism.

01:20:59.595 --> 01:21:03.793
About 8% of all the people that we put
on this medication get positive results.

01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:04.888
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.333
You actually belong to these 8%.

01:21:08.437 --> 01:21:09.904
I looked through
your blood work,

01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:12.940
and I couldn't find
any traces of the disease.

01:21:13.942 --> 01:21:16.274
I don't want
to speak too soon,

01:21:16.378 --> 01:21:17.902
but we may have
beaten this thing.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.488
Are you fucking with me
'cause I fucked with you?

01:21:23.589 --> 01:21:26.888
So, that's the good news, Mr. Bond.

01:21:29.328 --> 01:21:31.990
So, this is, this is...
This is good news.

01:21:33.165 --> 01:21:35.133
Like my accent now?

01:21:35.234 --> 01:21:36.997
Now I like your accent, yeah.

01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:40.467
I was excited all morning
to tell you this news.

01:21:40.973 --> 01:21:43.339
So, what happens now?
What do I... What do I do now?

01:21:43.442 --> 01:21:47.173
Maybe you can make another funny
movie that I could laugh about.

01:21:47.312 --> 01:21:52.579
Yeah. Wow. I wasn't
expecting this to really work.

01:21:52.684 --> 01:21:54.015
I was getting
used to being sick.

01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:57.020
I was actually thinking
I was pretty good at that.

01:21:57.122 --> 01:21:59.056
Get back to your life.

01:22:07.266 --> 01:22:09.632
<i>Hey, this is Ira.</i>
<i>I'm not in. Leave a message.</i>

01:22:10.869 --> 01:22:16.535
Ira, I have a secret
to tell you. It will make you happy.

01:22:35.527 --> 01:22:37.518
Hi. Bonita?

01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:38.596
George.

01:22:41.934 --> 01:22:45.097
I was sick, you know that.
And I just went to the doctor's.

01:22:45.204 --> 01:22:47.399
He said I'm not sick anymore.

01:22:47.506 --> 01:22:49.406
Oh, congratulations.

01:22:52.744 --> 01:22:56.202
I found the pants you're looking for.
They are in the closet.

01:22:58.484 --> 01:23:00.076
Thank you.

01:23:01.186 --> 01:23:02.175
Bye, George.

01:23:03.989 --> 01:23:06.287
George! Is it true?

01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:08.423
It's true.
- Yes!

01:23:08.527 --> 01:23:10.154
It's all right. All right, go ahead.
- Yeah!

01:23:10.262 --> 01:23:11.229
All right.

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:14.299
Oh, God! Yeah!

01:23:14.399 --> 01:23:15.491
All right, baby.

01:23:15.601 --> 01:23:18.832
All right, all right.
Now what the fuck do we do?

01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:23.099
Hey, congratulations, George.
That's awesome, man.

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:24.869
Thank you.
You got cured of AIDS.

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.238
I didn't have AIDS.

01:23:26.345 --> 01:23:27.437
Hey, let me get you a cocktail.

01:23:27.546 --> 01:23:29.070
Hey, not an AIDS cocktail.
A regular.

01:23:29.181 --> 01:23:30.671
No, I don't want a drink.
I'm good.

01:23:30.782 --> 01:23:33.376
I'm gonna get one
of them ribbons.

01:23:33.986 --> 01:23:35.283
You're alive?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:35.387 --> 01:23:38.481
Unbelievable!
This guy. This guy, man.

01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:42.526
You got the women, you got the
fame, and you can't fucking die!

01:23:42.628 --> 01:23:44.823
Did you suck the devil's dick?
What is it, man?

01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:45.988
I wanna know the secret.

01:23:46.098 --> 01:23:47.793
I actually told a bunch
of people we did have sex,

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.299
so if you could
go along with that.

01:23:49.401 --> 01:23:50.561
You did?
- Yes.

01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:54.901
Everybody wants to fuck me,
but it's better that I don't

01:23:55.007 --> 01:23:56.372
because you don't want...

01:23:56.475 --> 01:23:58.636
The mystery is definitely
more flattering...

01:23:58.744 --> 01:23:59.711
Yeah?

01:23:59.811 --> 01:24:02.541
...and the reality
is so, like, flobbety.

01:24:02.648 --> 01:24:04.343
Like not the word, but...
Floppety? Yeah, lippety.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.684
Yeah, I look like this.
Like a sandwich.

01:24:06.785 --> 01:24:08.548
Like a... There's,
like, meat coming.

01:24:09.755 --> 01:24:11.814
That would have been...
I could get...

01:24:11.924 --> 01:24:13.585
Look at that!

01:24:14.226 --> 01:24:15.921
"Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker!"

01:24:16.028 --> 01:24:18.690
Shit! Shit! I didn't know you
had energy like that. Jesus...

01:24:20.494 --> 01:24:22.985
How did he...
Like, how did he know he had it?

01:24:23.731 --> 01:24:27.861
He was saying... He said that he was, like,
dizzy and tired and he went to the doctor,

01:24:27.968 --> 01:24:30.937
and then he just got...
It was in his blood work.

01:24:31.038 --> 01:24:33.370
That sucks 'cause
I get dizzy and tired.

01:24:33.474 --> 01:24:34.441
Really?

01:24:35.342 --> 01:24:37.902
Anybody... Anybody gets sick,
I think I'm going to get it.

01:24:38.012 --> 01:24:40.105
Now, is it contagious?
It's not contagious?

01:24:40.214 --> 01:24:41.203
No.
- Can you get it, like...

01:24:41.315 --> 01:24:44.648
I hope not. I don't think so.
I've been around him a lot. I feel...

01:24:44.752 --> 01:24:46.185
I feel...
I hope not, too, because

01:24:46.287 --> 01:24:48.847
when you were talking, a little
bit of your spit hit my lip, so...

01:24:48.956 --> 01:24:50.321
It did?
- Yeah. Not that you got it,

01:24:50.424 --> 01:24:52.358
but he spits on your lip, you
spit on mine, next thing you know

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.826
I'm dead and my wife's
fucking George Lopez.

01:24:55.196 --> 01:24:56.754
But I think the best thing
for you would be, you know...

01:24:56.864 --> 01:24:58.525
The best cure,
besides the real cure,

01:24:58.632 --> 01:25:02.363
is to get back to work
and do what you do.

01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:04.738
There are stacks of offers
on my desk for you.

01:25:04.839 --> 01:25:07.740
I mean, you can't swing a dead cat
without hitting an offer for you.

01:25:07.842 --> 01:25:09.332
Oh, good.
Yeah, you ready for this?

01:25:09.443 --> 01:25:11.468
Paul Rudd wants to do
a bromance with you.

01:25:11.579 --> 01:25:14.639
I think I might... I just might
even not work for a little while.

01:25:14.749 --> 01:25:16.239
I was thinking maybe just,
like, taking time off,

01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:20.013
try to get myself in a
relationship with, like,

01:25:20.121 --> 01:25:21.884
another human being,
a normal one.

01:25:21.989 --> 01:25:23.047
Just see if I can
handle that.

01:25:23.157 --> 01:25:24.454
Funny you should say that.
I've... 'Cause I invited someone.

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.343
Brought... Invited this woman here
today that I think you'd really like.

01:25:28.452 --> 01:25:29.441
I think you'd really
hit it off with her.

01:25:29.553 --> 01:25:31.987
She's... She's great.
She's something new for you.

01:25:32.089 --> 01:25:34.284
A real person.
She's not a waitress.

01:25:34.392 --> 01:25:35.586
She's not an actress.

01:25:35.693 --> 01:25:36.660
All right, thanks.

01:25:37.161 --> 01:25:41.029
You know, the Internet dating thing
actually... Actually kind of works.

01:25:41.432 --> 01:25:42.399
That's good.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.899
I've actually been
on a couple of JDates.

01:25:44.001 --> 01:25:44.968
No way. What's that?

01:25:45.069 --> 01:25:46.400
Yeah... What's a JDate?

01:25:46.504 --> 01:25:48.495
What, is that an Internet
thing I should know about?

01:25:48.606 --> 01:25:50.164
I'm not...
I don't do that shit.

01:25:50.274 --> 01:25:53.368
It's a website where Jewish
people can find each other.

01:25:53.477 --> 01:25:55.707
Really? A whole list of Jewish people?
- Yeah.

01:25:55.813 --> 01:25:59.010
I didn't think Jewish people
liked to be on lists.

01:26:00.584 --> 01:26:02.552
Because of the Holocaust.

01:26:04.255 --> 01:26:05.813
Wow.

01:26:05.923 --> 01:26:07.185
How's this going,
by the way?

01:26:08.492 --> 01:26:10.585
It's been great to meet you.

01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:15.027
You know what?
I think you fucked up.

01:26:16.634 --> 01:26:17.601
How's that?

01:26:17.702 --> 01:26:19.499
I think you fucked up.
I think...

01:26:20.738 --> 01:26:22.569
I don't think you should
have took that medicine.

01:26:22.673 --> 01:26:23.867
Why not?

01:26:25.242 --> 01:26:28.211
I don't know. Personally, I think
you should have just let yourself die.

01:26:28.346 --> 01:26:30.041
Honestly, man, what are...
What are you gonna do now?

01:26:30.147 --> 01:26:32.240
Make another bullshit movie?

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.545
Fuck another chick
who doesn't like you?

01:26:34.652 --> 01:26:36.745
You know? That was
your way out right there.

01:26:36.854 --> 01:26:38.378
Hmm.
Now you're fucking stuck.

01:26:38.489 --> 01:26:39.478
Yeah.

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.251
You're stuck just like me.

01:26:41.359 --> 01:26:42.826
Can't go to fucking
Chuck E. Cheese.

01:26:42.927 --> 01:26:45.452
I can't go to Target,
I can't go to Best Buy.

01:26:45.596 --> 01:26:47.291
I can't go to fucking
Wal-Mart, Kmart.

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:49.059
You fucking name it,
I can't go there.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.189
Yeah, that's true.

01:26:50.301 --> 01:26:52.462
Everyone in this fucking room
is either staring at us,

01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:54.060
wanting to take a fucking picture.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26:54.672 --> 01:26:55.934
Yeah. Got it.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.029
E-mail that to me.

01:26:57.141 --> 01:26:59.234
I will. That's awesome.
Yeah.

01:26:59.343 --> 01:27:03.211
Who the fuck is that guy right there?
That fucking guy right there.

01:27:03.414 --> 01:27:05.575
What? Ray Romano's bothering you?

01:27:05.683 --> 01:27:06.945
Who? Ray, Ray who?

01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:09.519
Ray Romano, the guy from
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:10.712
I don't give a fuck
what show he's on.

01:27:10.821 --> 01:27:12.652
I'll fuck this
motherfucker up, man!

01:27:12.757 --> 01:27:14.884
Hey.
- Hey, Ray!

01:27:14.992 --> 01:27:15.959
Hello, Marshall.

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:17.459
Fucking problem here, buddy?

01:27:18.396 --> 01:27:21.422
Would you like to fuck me?
Is that what this is?

01:27:21.532 --> 01:27:22.590
I don't get it, man.
What's going on?

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.794
Would you like me to fucking
bend over for you right now?

01:27:25.903 --> 01:27:27.495
Say no.
- No, man.

01:27:29.106 --> 01:27:30.596
I just gotta always
be on my toes, man.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:31.675
You know?

01:27:31.776 --> 01:27:33.141
I see that,
but not with Ray Romano.

01:27:33.244 --> 01:27:34.871
This is why I don't
go out of the house.

01:27:34.979 --> 01:27:37.243
I thought everybody loved you.

01:27:38.682 --> 01:27:43.381
So, now that you got this, this second
chance, man, like, what do you want?

01:27:43.487 --> 01:27:45.318
I kind of don't want anything.

01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:48.321
So, then what are we celebrating?

01:28:00.838 --> 01:28:01.805
Clarke?

01:28:01.906 --> 01:28:02.873
<i>Yes, it's Clarke.</i>

01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:06.409
It's Clarke and I...
I'm calling to check on you, matey.

01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:08.805
Yeah.

01:28:08.913 --> 01:28:13.782
<i>I'm back from the sea.</i>
<i>It's fun to play with my didjeridu!</i>

01:28:13.884 --> 01:28:16.250
You sound
a little bit like a pirate.

01:28:16.353 --> 01:28:19.789
<i>Do I sound Australian?</i>
<i>Is this what Clarke sounds like?</i>

01:28:19.924 --> 01:28:22.358
That's a terrible
Australian accent.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.449
What are you doing, Laura?

01:28:23.561 --> 01:28:25.028
Am I bothering you? Is he there?
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:26.858
Am I supposed to hang up?
What's going on?

01:28:27.064 --> 01:28:29.259
<i>Clarke's away</i>
<i>for business in China.</i>

01:28:29.366 --> 01:28:32.028
Ah! Sent him out
for egg rolls again?

01:28:32.136 --> 01:28:34.604
Are you guys all right?
What's going on?

01:28:35.005 --> 01:28:36.905
Mable has her
recital tomorrow.

01:28:37.007 --> 01:28:38.406
She's singing
<i>Memory</i> from <i>Cats.</i>

01:28:38.509 --> 01:28:39.498
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:40.804
<i>You know that song,</i>
Memory?

01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:42.776
Yeah. I wish I could
be there to see that.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.847
<i>You can come.</i>

01:28:43.948 --> 01:28:45.916
I can come?
All right, I'm coming.

01:28:46.016 --> 01:28:47.142
<i>Your daughter will be</i>
<i>all right with that?</i>

01:28:47.251 --> 01:28:49.378
<i>That I'm sitting right next
to you holding you tight?</i>

01:28:49.487 --> 01:28:52.081
Stop. How are you feeling?

01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:54.054
I'm doing good. I'm doing...

01:28:54.158 --> 01:28:55.989
It is what it is. I...

01:28:56.093 --> 01:28:57.617
<i>So, what happened</i>
<i>with your tests?</i>

01:28:58.262 --> 01:29:00.423
Laura, let's not
talk about all that.

01:29:00.531 --> 01:29:01.657
<i>What did</i>
<i>the doctor say?</i>

01:29:02.266 --> 01:29:06.396
<i>The Swedish Nazi?</i>
<i>He never has good news.</i>

01:29:06.504 --> 01:29:09.200
<i>It is what it is.</i>
<i>I don't want to talk about it.</i>

01:29:10.241 --> 01:29:12.607
Come on,
let's just talk about you.

01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:15.110
<i>What are you doing, Laura?</i>

01:29:15.212 --> 01:29:16.907
Do you want me
to talk you to sleep?

01:29:17.381 --> 01:29:19.349
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>You remember.</i>

01:29:20.985 --> 01:29:22.247
<i>You want me</i>
<i>to do that for you?</i>

01:29:22.353 --> 01:29:23.843
You will talk to me
while I try to go to sleep?

01:29:23.954 --> 01:29:26.821
I'll put you on speakerphone.
That will be the best night of my life.

01:29:26.924 --> 01:29:30.189
Let's not go to sleep yet, though, please.
Just talk to Laura.

01:29:31.695 --> 01:29:32.719
<i>Hello?</i>

01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:34.024
Hi, Ira.

01:29:34.131 --> 01:29:35.120
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

01:29:35.699 --> 01:29:37.326
Ira, you're my best friend.

01:29:37.434 --> 01:29:38.992
<i>I like you, too.</i>

01:29:39.136 --> 01:29:40.899
You're my best friend.

01:29:41.005 --> 01:29:42.734
You sound like you're
in a good mood, man.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.308
I'm in a great mood
because we're setting sail today.

01:29:45.409 --> 01:29:46.899
We're gonna do a gig together!

01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:48.376
Ira and Georgie, finally
on the road!

01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:53.511
Oh, we're setting sail, are
we? Where, where are we going?

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:58.024
<i>We're going to the Port of San Francisco.
We set sail on the morrow.</i>

01:29:58.125 --> 01:29:59.490
How much time
am I supposed to do?

01:29:59.593 --> 01:30:04.053
Oh, they've booked you to do a minute
for every inch of cock you have.

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:06.725
<i>You'll be doing two and
a half to four minutes,</i>

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:09.394
<i>depending on your mood,</i>
<i>little Ira.</i>

01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:14.534
<i>I was invited to a...</i>
<i>Or I was able to go to a fundraiser</i>

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.133
<i>for Barack Obama,</i>
<i>when he was running for president.</i>

01:30:17.778 --> 01:30:22.147
<i>And you could walk</i>
<i>right up to him and I did.</i>

01:30:22.249 --> 01:30:26.151
<i>And I prepared a smart
question and I was like,</i>

01:30:26.253 --> 01:30:32.817
<i>" Senator Obama, when you were a student
in Boston, did you encounter any racism?"</i>

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:38.888
<i>And he said something really,</i>
<i>really interesting. He said...</i>

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.127
<i>He said, "I'm Kanye West."</i>

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:50.001
George, you have a visitor.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.237
Oh.

01:30:52.012 --> 01:30:53.912
Hi.
Whoa!

01:30:54.014 --> 01:30:55.038
Hello.
Wow.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.514
Hey, hi!
- Hey!

01:30:56.650 --> 01:30:58.015
All right.
How are you?

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.086
I'm good.

01:30:59.186 --> 01:31:01.017
I'm so psyched you came.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.022
Wow, you look amazing!
- Thank you.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:04.887
Beautiful.
- I think I overdressed.

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.220
No way.
You look incredible.

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.316
I just...

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.918
Where... Where is he?
Where is the Clarke?

01:31:10.719 --> 01:31:14.348
The Clarke? He's out of town.
I was gonna bring my friend Betsy with me,

01:31:14.456 --> 01:31:16.549
but her son started
throwing up, so...

01:31:16.658 --> 01:31:19.388
The husband's out of town,
baby's vomiting. Rock 'n' roll.

01:31:19.495 --> 01:31:22.953
I like it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:23.065 --> 01:31:24.396
Anyway, I don't
want to keep you

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.524
or get in the way.

01:31:25.634 --> 01:31:27.158
No, don't run away.
Come on, Ira, say hello.

01:31:27.269 --> 01:31:28.236
Hey, Ira.

01:31:28.337 --> 01:31:29.361
Hey, how's it going?

01:31:29.471 --> 01:31:32.065
So, I'll let you go.
I just wanted to say hi.

01:31:32.174 --> 01:31:33.971
No cursing.
Don't curse so much.

01:31:34.076 --> 01:31:36.169
Okay, all right! Nothing
dirty. I don't know how.

01:31:36.278 --> 01:31:39.304
You just cut my set in half, but
that's fine. All right, see you, kid.

01:31:39.414 --> 01:31:40.381
Okay, good luck.

01:31:40.482 --> 01:31:42.109
Thanks for coming.

01:31:44.186 --> 01:31:47.451
You gotta tell her I'm better
at intermission, all right?

01:31:47.556 --> 01:31:49.046
You haven't told her
that you're better?

01:31:49.158 --> 01:31:50.853
No, I'm not good
at stuff like that.

01:31:50.959 --> 01:31:53.052
Just... She'll be cool
with it. She'll be...

01:31:53.162 --> 01:31:56.290
You're giving her good
news, she'll be happy.

01:31:56.398 --> 01:31:57.695
We're gonna go by her
house tomorrow, too.

01:31:58.901 --> 01:32:00.926
Yeah, we're just visiting her.
I just want to say hi,

01:32:01.036 --> 01:32:02.970
see how she's doing, where
she lives, that kind of thing.

01:32:03.272 --> 01:32:05.740
Why did you guys break up
in the first place?

01:32:06.475 --> 01:32:07.840
I cheated on her.

01:32:07.943 --> 01:32:09.774
Why would you
cheat on her?

01:32:09.878 --> 01:32:13.041
It's easy not to cheat when no one
wants to fuck you, you judgmental prick.

01:32:13.148 --> 01:32:14.172
Okay.

01:32:15.644 --> 01:32:20.707
<i>I have a theory that Tom Cruise,
David Beckham and Will Smith</i>

01:32:20.816 --> 01:32:22.807
<i>have mooshed the heads</i>
<i>of their penises together.</i>

01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:26.349
<i>I think that</i>
<i>this has happened.</i>

01:32:26.455 --> 01:32:28.082
<i>I don't think it happened
in a gay way.</i>

01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:29.521
<i>I think it just happened</i>
<i>out of boredom.</i>

01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:31.593
<i>I think just</i>
<i>rich-dude boredom.</i>

01:32:31.694 --> 01:32:35.130
<i>Just like, "What have we not done,
guys? We've done everything!"</i>

01:32:35.264 --> 01:32:37.732
<i>" I'll tell you</i>
<i>one thing we haven't done. "</i>

01:32:37.833 --> 01:32:41.269
<i>And I bet when it happened, it was
an epic occurrence. It was huge.</i>

01:32:41.403 --> 01:32:42.495
<i>I think of it all the time.</i>

01:32:42.605 --> 01:32:44.903
<i>I think first, you know,</i>
<i>David and Tom touched dick heads.</i>

01:32:45.007 --> 01:32:49.171
<i>And it was easy, just zoonk.</i>
<i>Because there was a magnetic field to it.</i>

01:32:49.378 --> 01:32:51.141
<i>And then Will Smith started</i>
<i>approaching with his dick</i>

01:32:51.247 --> 01:32:53.112
<i>and, like, wind started</i>
<i>blowing in his face,</i>

01:32:53.215 --> 01:32:57.982
<i>and paper started flying everywhere</i>
<i>and he just couldn't do it.</i>

01:32:58.087 --> 01:32:59.679
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>"Come on, Will, get it in there!"</i>

01:32:59.788 --> 01:33:01.153
<i>"I can't do it!"</i>

01:33:01.257 --> 01:33:02.224
<i>Beckham yells,</i>

01:33:02.324 --> 01:33:05.350
<i> "Don't cross the streams!</i>
<i>It's like</i> Ghost Busters!"

01:33:05.628 --> 01:33:07.960
<i>And then he does it and</i>
Flash <i>by Queen starts playing.</i>

01:33:08.063 --> 01:33:09.428
<i>It's just, Flash! Ahhh!</i>

01:33:09.832 --> 01:33:14.326
<i>Light shoots into the sky!</i>
<i>That's how stars are born, I think.</i>

01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:19.068
<i>Anyway, I'm Ira Wright. Have a good
night. Thank you, all, very much.</i>

01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:27.378
Hey.
How's it going?

01:33:27.483 --> 01:33:28.745
That was so good!

01:33:29.485 --> 01:33:31.112
You seem so surprised.

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.380
Well, you looked
so nervous before.

01:33:32.488 --> 01:33:33.614
I was, actually.

01:33:33.722 --> 01:33:34.746
That was good.
That was really good.

01:33:34.857 --> 01:33:36.324
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

01:33:36.425 --> 01:33:39.826
And the ball cleavage thing,
that was hilarious.

01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:43.398
Classic stuff. Thank you.
Glad you're having fun.

01:33:45.868 --> 01:33:47.836
George says that he's known
you for a while. How did...

01:33:47.937 --> 01:33:49.768
Yeah.
How did you guys first hook up?

01:33:49.872 --> 01:33:52.340
I was the hat-check girl at
the lmprov and I was an actress.

01:33:52.675 --> 01:33:53.801
So, you kind of...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33:53.909 --> 01:33:57.003
That's good. What, were you
in anything I might've seen?

01:33:57.112 --> 01:34:01.845
I did those, like,
<i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>90210.</i>

01:34:01.951 --> 01:34:02.918
Awesome.

01:34:03.018 --> 01:34:04.076
I always played the bitch.

01:34:04.186 --> 01:34:05.346
I wasn't that good, actually.

01:34:05.454 --> 01:34:06.751
No, you must be a great actress,

01:34:06.855 --> 01:34:08.413
'cause you're not
at all bitchy, so...

01:34:09.692 --> 01:34:10.750
Thanks, Ira.

01:34:10.859 --> 01:34:15.660
Okay, look, I'm not...
Honestly, I'm not supposed to be telling you

01:34:15.764 --> 01:34:18.460
what I'm about to tell you because George...
He doesn't want to jinx it.

01:34:18.567 --> 01:34:22.867
It's not 100%, but the last
time that he went to the doctor,

01:34:22.972 --> 01:34:26.965
they couldn't find any trace of the
disease in his blood work anymore,

01:34:27.076 --> 01:34:29.636
so it seems like
he might be better.

01:34:29.745 --> 01:34:30.734
What are you talking about?

01:34:30.846 --> 01:34:32.074
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:34:32.181 --> 01:34:33.512
We think he might be okay.

01:34:33.616 --> 01:34:35.709
<i>... George Simmons!</i>

01:34:46.962 --> 01:34:48.259
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:34:48.364 --> 01:34:51.959
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you. Yeah.</i>

01:34:54.103 --> 01:34:55.934
<i>It's great to be here.</i>

01:34:57.239 --> 01:35:00.072
<i>It's great.</i>
<i>It's great to be alive!</i>

01:35:01.677 --> 01:35:04.612
<i>Yeah, man. Thank you.</i>
<i>Right on. Okay.</i>

01:35:04.713 --> 01:35:05.805
Thank you for coming, George!

01:35:05.914 --> 01:35:06.938
<i>Thank you. All right.</i>

01:35:07.049 --> 01:35:09.711
<i>That's very nice.</i>
<i>Man, oh, man.</i>

01:35:10.452 --> 01:35:13.751
<i>Any other 40-year-olds</i>
<i>out there tonight? In their 40s?</i>

01:35:13.856 --> 01:35:15.118
<i>It's funny.</i>
<i>In your 20s you're like,</i>

01:35:15.224 --> 01:35:17.317
<i>" Fuck you, man.</i>
<i>Fuck that shit.</i>

01:35:17.426 --> 01:35:19.860
<i>" Fuck my parents.</i>
<i>I don't need none of that shit. "</i>

01:35:19.962 --> 01:35:21.657
<i>In your 30s you're like,</i>
<i>"Fuck the President.</i>

01:35:21.764 --> 01:35:24.096
<i>" Fuck that guy,</i>
<i>that fucking asshole. "</i>

01:35:24.199 --> 01:35:26.429
<i>In your 40s you're like,</i>
<i>"I'm hungry.</i>

01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.761
<i>" What do we have</i>
<i>in the fridge?"</i>

01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:37.005
<i>So, yeah, I'm fucking</i>
<i>famous and rich, and it's crazy.</i>

01:35:38.013 --> 01:35:40.277
<i>It's... You know why?</i>
<i>'Cause I hate rich people.</i>

01:35:40.382 --> 01:35:41.906
<i>Fucking I'm rich</i>
<i>and I hate rich people.</i>

01:35:42.017 --> 01:35:44.178
<i>I hate everything</i>
<i>I fucking do now.</i>

01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:45.378
<i>I go to Hawaii, I'm like,</i>

01:35:45.487 --> 01:35:49.787
<i>" You fucking snotty cocksucker,</i>
<i>going to Hawaii. "</i>

01:35:50.392 --> 01:35:54.328
<i>Buy a new car, " La-di-da,</i>
<i>look who's got a new car. "</i>

01:35:54.997 --> 01:35:58.398
<i>You know, I thought about</i>
<i>giving all my money, just giving it away,</i>

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.765
<i>but then I was like,</i>
<i>"What a rich-guy thing to do.</i>

01:36:04.006 --> 01:36:05.633
<i>"Mr. Charitable."</i>

01:36:07.042 --> 01:36:09.442
Well, why didn't you tell me?
I was just here.

01:36:09.545 --> 01:36:12.139
Laura, if I told you, you might not
have talked to me anymore, so I...

01:36:12.247 --> 01:36:13.976
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

01:36:14.083 --> 01:36:15.948
I knew you forgave me
because I was sick

01:36:16.051 --> 01:36:17.814
and there was no other way
you would forgive me.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.217
I know,
but it's different now.

01:36:19.321 --> 01:36:21.585
We've been talking...
What are you... No!

01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:22.657
Really?

01:36:22.758 --> 01:36:24.885
This is...
So, what are you... So, did the...

01:36:25.294 --> 01:36:27.228
The doctor said I'm good.
I'm better for now.

01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:28.626
I don't know what
the hell's gonna happen,

01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:29.720
but for now the guy
said I'm good.

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:35.582
I'm so happy.

01:36:35.692 --> 01:36:36.886
You are happy?

01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:40.259
Mmm-hmm.
- God, thank you. Thank you.

01:36:50.941 --> 01:36:53.000
All right. Yeah.

01:36:58.415 --> 01:36:59.541
You okay, man?

01:36:59.649 --> 01:37:01.082
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:37:02.519 --> 01:37:03.508
I hope they got some food.

01:37:05.956 --> 01:37:06.980
Hey, hey.

01:37:07.123 --> 01:37:08.784
Hi!
- Hi.

01:37:08.925 --> 01:37:12.292
I'm so glad you guys came.
Hello. Hi.

01:37:12.395 --> 01:37:13.953
Good to see you. Wow.
Hi. How's it going?

01:37:14.064 --> 01:37:15.031
Hello, Ira.

01:37:15.131 --> 01:37:17.531
Oh! Thank you.

01:37:18.702 --> 01:37:20.693
Jeez. Beautiful house!

01:37:20.804 --> 01:37:21.771
Thank you.

01:37:21.905 --> 01:37:23.964
How long have
you guys been here?

01:37:24.074 --> 01:37:26.167
We've been here
about five years now.

01:37:27.377 --> 01:37:28.344
What's up?

01:37:28.445 --> 01:37:31.346
This is my friend, George.
And this is Ira.

01:37:31.448 --> 01:37:32.608
This is Ingrid.

01:37:32.716 --> 01:37:35.981
Wow! George didn't mention
you had a daughter.

01:37:36.853 --> 01:37:38.252
Have you seen any of my movies?

01:37:38.355 --> 01:37:40.846
I saw the movie where
you had a baby body.

01:37:40.991 --> 01:37:44.051
So, you saw <i>Re-Do.</i>
Can you do the face?

01:37:52.369 --> 01:37:54.200
Hey, that's a good impression.

01:37:54.571 --> 01:37:56.232
Don't leave me
in the playroom!

01:37:56.339 --> 01:37:58.739
This is my daughter, Mable.
She just got braces.

01:37:58.875 --> 01:38:00.103
Oh, yeah?
Let me see them.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:03.875
You mind if I eat a little bit
of that sandwich right there?

01:38:05.582 --> 01:38:07.311
Ira?
- I'm... I'm full.

01:38:07.417 --> 01:38:09.351
Do you guys want to play
the peanut-butter game?

01:38:09.452 --> 01:38:11.545
It's fun.
You want to play?

01:38:11.655 --> 01:38:13.054
Let's do it!
Ira?

01:38:13.156 --> 01:38:14.316
Yeah, I like peanut butter, yeah.

01:38:14.424 --> 01:38:15.550
Let's do the peanut-butter game!

01:38:15.659 --> 01:38:16.785
All right!
Hooray!

01:38:16.893 --> 01:38:19.953
Peanut-butter game!
Peanut-butter game!

01:38:20.163 --> 01:38:21.255
Okay, just put a little bit.

01:38:21.364 --> 01:38:22.388
- Okay.
- What's she doing?

01:38:22.499 --> 01:38:23.466
A little bit.

01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:26.391
Okay, okay.
I think that's good.

01:38:26.503 --> 01:38:29.370
This is what you guys do
in your free time? Okay.

01:38:29.472 --> 01:38:30.803
- There he is!
- Oh, boy.

01:38:30.907 --> 01:38:31.874
Come on.

01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:35.039
He got her.
He got her.

01:38:38.081 --> 01:38:40.345
Oh, so, you're supposed
to do it on the ears.

01:38:40.483 --> 01:38:42.280
George's turn!
Yeah! George's turn!

01:38:42.385 --> 01:38:43.579
No. I don't want to do that.

01:38:43.687 --> 01:38:45.211
Yeah, George's turn!
No, Ira will go. Let Ira go.

01:38:45.322 --> 01:38:46.687
No, no, George.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:48.155
Come on.
- Okay, all right!

01:38:48.758 --> 01:38:50.623
I just washed
my hair this morning.

01:38:50.727 --> 01:38:52.388
George! George!
George! George!

01:38:54.664 --> 01:38:56.757
Oh, God!

01:38:58.868 --> 01:38:59.857
No!

01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.959
Just not the...

01:39:01.071 --> 01:39:02.038
Look at this.

01:39:02.138 --> 01:39:03.605
That's not the game!

01:39:09.579 --> 01:39:13.174
And we have a pond
with a Buddha and...

01:39:13.283 --> 01:39:14.250
Wow!

01:39:18.254 --> 01:39:19.619
Does that hurt?

01:39:19.723 --> 01:39:22.521
So, what... Who is a good...
You're a good guy, you're a bad guy?

01:39:43.647 --> 01:39:47.310
Now I go.

01:39:47.417 --> 01:39:48.816
And now I go.

01:39:48.918 --> 01:39:51.054
You can't move.
You're stuck.

01:39:51.154 --> 01:39:52.143
Ira.
- Hey.

01:39:52.255 --> 01:39:54.951
Hey, Laura asked if we want
to eat dinner here tonight.

01:39:55.725 --> 01:39:58.785
Oh. Thank you.
What... We...

01:39:58.895 --> 01:40:00.021
It's like an
eight-hour drive back.

01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.758
We won't get home till like
5:00 in the morning that way.

01:40:02.866 --> 01:40:03.890
We'll figure something out.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.697
So, we're gonna go to the grocery
store and get some food so I can cook.

01:40:07.804 --> 01:40:09.669
Home-cooked meal. Perfect.

01:40:09.773 --> 01:40:11.604
Okay. So, you're okay
to watch the girls?

01:40:11.708 --> 01:40:13.403
Yeah, definitely.
I'm good with kids.

01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:16.411
I was a... I was a Jewish summer
camp counselor for five years.

01:40:17.981 --> 01:40:20.381
But I'm good with
non-Jewish kids, too.

01:40:20.483 --> 01:40:22.781
Okay, so we'll be right back.
It's around the corner.

01:40:22.886 --> 01:40:24.183
Very good.

01:40:32.028 --> 01:40:34.861
Should I have worn my jogging shoes?
Where are we going?

01:40:47.077 --> 01:40:48.942
You sure? You sure
you want to do this?

01:40:49.045 --> 01:40:50.034
Mmm-hmm.

01:40:50.146 --> 01:40:51.977
Wherever my husband is, he's
probably doing the same thing.

01:40:52.082 --> 01:40:53.071
Mmm-hmm.

01:40:53.183 --> 01:40:54.241
Okay.

01:40:55.952 --> 01:40:56.919
Jesus.

01:41:00.223 --> 01:41:01.781
Echo, echo, echo.

01:41:06.696 --> 01:41:07.788
You know, when
I broke up with you,

01:41:07.897 --> 01:41:11.799
I tried to find somebody who
was the exact opposite of you.

01:41:14.437 --> 01:41:16.905
But Clarke
is exactly like you.

01:41:18.408 --> 01:41:21.809
It's like I'm programmed
to find the same person,

01:41:22.846 --> 01:41:26.282
like there's some lesson I'm
supposed to learn from it all.

01:41:27.884 --> 01:41:30.352
How many times
did you cheat on me?

01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.989
I don't want
to paint a picture.

01:41:34.090 --> 01:41:38.220
I was young and stupid, but
I changed, I swear to God.

01:41:39.496 --> 01:41:41.987
How exactly
have you changed?

01:41:42.132 --> 01:41:46.330
I got a peek at something most
people only get to see once.

01:41:48.471 --> 01:41:50.996
You know, I went to a
psychic who told me that...

01:41:51.107 --> 01:41:55.510
That you and I would get
back together when we were 70.

01:41:55.612 --> 01:41:58.012
And she also said
not to eat any chicken.

01:41:58.748 --> 01:42:00.238
Well, we couldn't wait.

01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:01.476
Mmm-hmm.

01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:04.982
You loved me before
anybody loved me.

01:42:05.088 --> 01:42:06.055
I know.

01:42:11.795 --> 01:42:15.162
This is the only place
that I ever wanted to be.

01:42:16.132 --> 01:42:18.623
When is George gonna die?

01:42:18.735 --> 01:42:20.726
George is gonna die?

01:42:22.772 --> 01:42:24.933
No. Why would you guys say that?

01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:28.204
I heard my mom talking to her friend
on the phone, and she was crying.

01:42:28.311 --> 01:42:30.074
I don't want George to die.

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:31.807
Why do you care?
You just met him.

01:42:31.915 --> 01:42:32.904
Shut up.

01:42:33.016 --> 01:42:34.881
You shut up!
Okay, okay, guys, guys, guys.

01:42:34.984 --> 01:42:36.383
George is not gonna die.

01:42:36.486 --> 01:42:40.320
George, he was sick,
but he went to the doctor

01:42:40.423 --> 01:42:41.947
and they gave him
different types of medicine

01:42:42.058 --> 01:42:43.525
until they found
one that worked.

01:42:43.626 --> 01:42:45.253
And now he's gonna
be just fine.

01:42:45.361 --> 01:42:47.329
He's gonna live a really,
really long time.

01:42:47.564 --> 01:42:49.555
I think my mommy loves him.

01:42:50.733 --> 01:42:53.793
Well, you know,
we all love him.

01:42:53.903 --> 01:42:55.370
He's made a lot
of great movies.

01:42:55.471 --> 01:42:57.996
I think she loves him,
like, loves him.

01:42:58.107 --> 01:43:00.166
Love.
Love, love, love.

01:43:00.276 --> 01:43:03.973
<i>Love, love, love</i>
<i>They're gonna have a baby</i>

01:43:04.214 --> 01:43:08.981
<i>They're gonna have a baby</i>
<i>Baby, marriage, love</i>

01:43:09.719 --> 01:43:12.483
They're gonna have
a little MerMan baby.

01:43:17.327 --> 01:43:20.990
You saved my acting reel?
I was wondering where this was.

01:43:21.097 --> 01:43:22.428
Why didn't you give this to me?

01:43:22.532 --> 01:43:23.794
'Cause I was watching it.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:26.664
<i>You know, I always get the feeling
that you think I'm stupid or something.</i>

01:43:26.769 --> 01:43:28.930
Look at my hair!
I look like a leprechaun.

01:43:29.038 --> 01:43:30.130
<i>No.</i>

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.264
<i>I am stupid.</i>

01:43:31.374 --> 01:43:33.535
Ooh! Is my voice
still that high?

01:43:33.643 --> 01:43:36.908
No! No, no, no, no. No, but they
need you back in Munchkinville.

01:43:37.013 --> 01:43:38.674
They miss the mayor.

01:43:38.781 --> 01:43:40.009
Shut up!

01:43:40.416 --> 01:43:42.782
That was the best time in my life.

01:43:43.253 --> 01:43:45.847
I got something else for you.
You might remember these.

01:43:46.689 --> 01:43:48.816
Please tell me you do!

01:43:49.726 --> 01:43:51.125
Are these my favorite butt jeans?

01:43:51.227 --> 01:43:52.592
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:53.696
Really?

01:43:53.796 --> 01:43:54.763
Yeah, you can have them back.

01:43:54.864 --> 01:43:56.126
I'm so excited!
- Yeah.

01:43:56.232 --> 01:43:57.699
Do you think they still fit me?

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.789
I guarantee it.

01:43:58.902 --> 01:43:59.960
I'm so happy!

01:44:00.069 --> 01:44:02.697
I guarantee it.
Get in those.

01:44:02.805 --> 01:44:04.636
These used to kill me.
Oh, my God, they're so faded.

01:44:04.741 --> 01:44:06.231
Oh, shit!

01:44:06.342 --> 01:44:07.331
They fit!

01:44:07.443 --> 01:44:08.808
They look good!
- Really?

01:44:08.912 --> 01:44:10.436
Yeah, that's the same ass!

01:44:10.546 --> 01:44:14.607
Fucking ass is perfect. Minus
that camel coming out the back.

01:44:14.717 --> 01:44:16.844
<i>Bump and groove it</i>

01:44:16.953 --> 01:44:19.717
<i>To the left now</i>
<i>To the right, y'all</i>

01:44:19.822 --> 01:44:20.789
<i>Slap that shit!</i>

01:44:23.293 --> 01:44:25.420
Look at that!
They're like Mom jeans.

01:44:25.528 --> 01:44:29.055
Oh, yes. If Mom needed
to get banged again.

01:44:29.165 --> 01:44:30.132
Thank you.

01:44:30.233 --> 01:44:31.598
Yeah, get over here.

01:44:35.638 --> 01:44:38.129
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

01:44:43.713 --> 01:44:46.307
Oh! Hey, guys,
what took you so long?

01:44:46.416 --> 01:44:48.907
We were checking out the town, man.
- Beautiful!

01:44:49.018 --> 01:44:50.144
Where are the groceries?

01:44:50.253 --> 01:44:53.313
We decided that eating
in might be more fun.

01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:55.958
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:44:56.059 --> 01:44:57.993
How could you do that, man? No.

01:44:58.328 --> 01:45:00.193
I didn't do anything, Ira.

01:45:00.296 --> 01:45:01.923
No, I know you did it.
I know you did.

01:45:02.065 --> 01:45:04.431
All that's missing is your Popsicle.
Come on.

01:45:04.534 --> 01:45:06.365
Ira, are you cranky right now?

01:45:06.469 --> 01:45:07.663
Do you need food in your belly?

01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:08.737
No.

01:45:08.838 --> 01:45:10.471
Come on, we're gonna
order in a pizza.

01:45:11.107 --> 01:45:14.167
<i> Of course,</i>
<i>Mr. Peters.</i>

01:45:14.277 --> 01:45:15.244
<i>I'll be at the...</i>

01:45:16.579 --> 01:45:17.876
<i>Lunch meeting.</i>

01:45:18.915 --> 01:45:21.213
<i>You're serving seafood?</i>

01:45:23.853 --> 01:45:25.718
<i>I love seafood!</i>

01:45:26.389 --> 01:45:28.152
<i>Okay, see you there!</i>

01:45:30.293 --> 01:45:31.783
Pizza's here!
- Yeah.

01:45:31.894 --> 01:45:33.293
I'll be right back.
- Yes.

01:45:33.396 --> 01:45:35.091
I'm the pizza monster!

01:45:39.002 --> 01:45:40.970
Hi, honey!

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:42.635
Clarke.
Hi, sweetie.

01:45:42.739 --> 01:45:44.934
Hi. What are you doing here?

01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:46.736
Decided to surprise you.

01:45:46.843 --> 01:45:49.607
The guy I was meant to have the
meeting with had a heart attack

01:45:49.712 --> 01:45:50.974
while I was waiting
in reception for him.

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.513
It was unbelievable.
- Wow.

01:45:52.615 --> 01:45:54.242
Next minute, this Chinese
George Clooney guy

01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:55.612
comes running past
with, like, the...

01:45:56.185 --> 01:45:57.413
What's it called?
A defibrillator?

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.817
Starts zapping him.
Right. Yeah, I've seen it.

01:45:58.955 --> 01:46:01.287
It was like an episode of
<i>ER,</i> but with Chinamen.

01:46:01.391 --> 01:46:03.382
I missed you.

01:46:08.498 --> 01:46:09.465
I know you.

01:46:09.565 --> 01:46:10.830
Yes.

01:46:12.168 --> 01:46:13.362
How you doing?

01:46:14.003 --> 01:46:15.265
This is George Simmons.

01:46:15.371 --> 01:46:16.895
He had a big comedy
concert last night.

01:46:17.006 --> 01:46:17.973
Oh, okay.

01:46:18.241 --> 01:46:21.039
And so, I asked him
to pop by and come visit.

01:46:22.311 --> 01:46:23.835
Hope that's good. I...

01:46:23.946 --> 01:46:25.413
I love the
stand-up comedy.

01:46:25.748 --> 01:46:27.340
Yeah, yeah.
How'd it go?

01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:31.648
They didn't... They didn't boo me
off the stage, so that was a plus.

01:46:31.754 --> 01:46:34.917
Yeah, they're a bunch of
bloody cheese eaters up here.

01:46:35.024 --> 01:46:36.753
Yeah. No, they were
very nice. Yeah.

01:46:36.859 --> 01:46:39.350
You have a...
You have a very nice family, man,

01:46:39.462 --> 01:46:40.929
and a great, great home.

01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:42.463
Thank you.

01:46:42.565 --> 01:46:43.964
Well, it's good
to have you home.

01:46:44.067 --> 01:46:45.591
The kids are dying
to see you if...

01:46:45.701 --> 01:46:48.602
Ira's hungry for...

01:46:48.704 --> 01:46:49.693
G'day. Clarke.

01:46:49.806 --> 01:46:51.467
Good day, I'm Ira.

01:46:51.574 --> 01:46:53.132
Your husband's here.
- Yeah. Yep.

01:46:53.242 --> 01:46:56.700
Ira is George's opening act.
He's really funny.

01:46:56.813 --> 01:46:58.644
Really?
He looks funny!

01:46:59.615 --> 01:47:00.582
Thank you.

01:47:00.683 --> 01:47:02.116
How'd you go last night?

01:47:02.218 --> 01:47:04.743
You know, they didn't boo
me off or anything, so...

01:47:04.854 --> 01:47:06.185
I just said that one.

01:47:06.289 --> 01:47:08.086
It was great.
- Yeah.

01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:10.386
They just popped by, I gave
them a tour of the house.

01:47:10.493 --> 01:47:12.188
We were gonna have
dinner, but it's not...

01:47:12.295 --> 01:47:14.354
It's probably better
that we do family dinner

01:47:14.464 --> 01:47:15.590
since you're only
in town a few days.

01:47:15.698 --> 01:47:16.756
No, stay.
- That's a great idea.

01:47:16.866 --> 01:47:18.060
The more the merrier.

01:47:18.167 --> 01:47:19.327
Okay. Let's do that.

01:47:19.635 --> 01:47:21.125
Thank you.
- Great.

01:47:21.237 --> 01:47:22.204
I'm gonna go
say hi to the kids.

01:47:22.305 --> 01:47:23.772
Okay.
Okay.

01:47:23.873 --> 01:47:25.340
That's hilarious.

01:47:25.441 --> 01:47:27.636
You can't tell him that
you're better, okay?

01:47:27.743 --> 01:47:30.007
He'll know that something
happened between us.

01:47:30.113 --> 01:47:31.171
I won't.
Okay?

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.578
'Cause I've been married for
12 years now and I have kids.

01:47:33.683 --> 01:47:35.913
And I can't just throw
it away this second, okay?

01:47:36.185 --> 01:47:40.451
Hey, we'll be fine. I'm a good
actor. You're a great actress.

01:47:40.556 --> 01:47:43.548
Right. He hated you until he
found out that you were sick.

01:47:43.659 --> 01:47:47.527
And if he knows that you were here and
that you're feeling better, he's gonna know.

01:47:47.663 --> 01:47:48.721
So, don't say anything.

01:47:48.831 --> 01:47:50.230
Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:47:50.333 --> 01:47:52.096
Of course. Sure.
I'll do that.

01:47:52.702 --> 01:47:55.034
People never thought China would
do that much business with the US,

01:47:55.138 --> 01:47:57.663
but I never saw it as a big deal.
You look at it like this.

01:47:57.773 --> 01:47:58.865
You've got a billion people.

01:47:58.975 --> 01:48:00.442
We make all kinds of cool shit.

01:48:00.543 --> 01:48:02.738
They find out about the cool shit,
like, on the Internet and stuff.

01:48:02.845 --> 01:48:03.812
And they're gonna
want the cool shit.

01:48:03.913 --> 01:48:05.676
Cool shit's universal.

01:48:05.781 --> 01:48:08.011
China's been good, but I'm trying
to get into North Korea now.

01:48:08.117 --> 01:48:09.641
That's the next...
That's, like, the next frontier.

01:48:09.752 --> 01:48:11.481
Wow. Wow. North Korea?
- North Korea.

01:48:11.621 --> 01:48:14.055
Those people would
blow you for a Wii Fit.

01:48:14.157 --> 01:48:15.351
There you go.

01:48:15.458 --> 01:48:17.221
This is really good pizza.

01:48:17.326 --> 01:48:19.089
You know, they say, like,
New York has the best pizza

01:48:19.195 --> 01:48:21.060
and I always thought
pizza in LA was only okay,

01:48:21.164 --> 01:48:22.188
but who would have
thought, you know,

01:48:22.298 --> 01:48:26.928
Marin County is where they were
really hiding the good pizza pies.

01:48:32.875 --> 01:48:34.775
Clarke speaks fluent Chinese.

01:48:34.877 --> 01:48:37.778
Really? Do you speak
Cantonese or Mandarin?

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.110
Oh, well played, Ira.
Mandarin.

01:48:40.216 --> 01:48:41.911
Well gayed, Ira.

01:48:42.018 --> 01:48:44.486
It's a bloody hard language,
though, George. Jesus.

01:49:01.771 --> 01:49:03.602
That was like a scene
from <i>Deer Hunter.</i>

01:49:06.909 --> 01:49:09.173
Girls, you can go and watch TV.

01:49:09.812 --> 01:49:12.474
Go on.
Whatever you want to watch.

01:49:13.583 --> 01:49:16.609
So, George, how's
the fight going, mate?

01:49:16.719 --> 01:49:17.686
How is it?

01:49:17.787 --> 01:49:22.281
Clarke. This is not something that
he wants to talk about right now.

01:49:22.391 --> 01:49:25.792
He has to think about
it every day of his life.

01:49:25.895 --> 01:49:28.728
And he's taking a
break from it right now.

01:49:28.831 --> 01:49:35.600
It's such a shame that
somebody who has brought so much joy

01:49:35.705 --> 01:49:38.401
to so many people
has to go through this.

01:49:39.342 --> 01:49:42.175
Shit. Shit.

01:49:42.278 --> 01:49:43.267
I'm sorry, mate.

01:49:43.379 --> 01:49:47.406
Laura. Laura.
We don't need to speak in code.

01:49:47.516 --> 01:49:49.643
I'm sick. I think
about it all the time.

01:49:49.752 --> 01:49:50.980
Mate,
I don't know how you do it.

01:49:51.087 --> 01:49:53.578
I would be crying
in my panties if I was you.

01:49:53.723 --> 01:49:55.714
I worship guys
like you, that attitude.

01:49:55.825 --> 01:49:57.292
Have you considered
Eastern medicine?

01:49:57.393 --> 01:50:00.226
Well, I don't know if this is
considered Eastern medicine,

01:50:00.329 --> 01:50:02.422
but I've been eating
a lot of rhino cock.

01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:06.365
If Clarke thinks it's the right
thing to do, let me chew some.

01:50:06.469 --> 01:50:08.403
For the last time,
stop calling me Rhino.

01:50:11.574 --> 01:50:13.371
George Simmons in my house!

01:50:13.476 --> 01:50:17.537
Clarke took an herb once, and he
had heart palpitations and diarrhea.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.113
No, it's true.
I shit myself, mate,

01:50:19.215 --> 01:50:20.614
and I had a boner
at the same time.

01:50:23.252 --> 01:50:25.550
I want to take an herb that
makes me as good-looking as you.

01:50:25.655 --> 01:50:27.247
Jesus Christ!

01:50:27.356 --> 01:50:29.551
If I were you I'd be at home
all day fucking myself.

01:50:29.659 --> 01:50:30.626
That's what I do!

01:50:32.495 --> 01:50:34.690
All right! All right!
We're cooking.

01:50:35.131 --> 01:50:36.655
He's really funny.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50:36.899 --> 01:50:38.491
I don't know why his movies
aren't funny, though.

01:50:38.601 --> 01:50:40.091
That's weird, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50:40.202 --> 01:50:41.692
He should put some of that
on the silver screen.

01:50:41.804 --> 01:50:43.066
So, just one drink,
okay?

01:50:43.172 --> 01:50:45.732
This isn't someone I want
to spend a lot of time with.

01:50:45.841 --> 01:50:47.741
This?
This is the Australian me?

01:50:47.843 --> 01:50:49.470
I'm so much better
than this fucking idiot.

01:50:49.578 --> 01:50:50.806
He seems like
the nicest guy, ever.

01:50:50.913 --> 01:50:52.710
He's trying to cure you
with herbs for God's sakes.

01:50:52.815 --> 01:50:54.874
I can't leave her alone here.
I have to save her.

01:50:54.984 --> 01:50:57.009
Save her from her beautiful
house and lovely husband

01:50:57.119 --> 01:50:58.245
and delightful kids?

01:50:58.354 --> 01:50:59.912
Her husband's a skipping,
cheating psycho.

01:51:00.022 --> 01:51:01.546
You said nothing was
going on between you two.

01:51:01.657 --> 01:51:03.522
The dog could tell
that you banged her.

01:51:03.626 --> 01:51:04.854
And I'm getting nauseous
and sweaty. I can't...

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:08.020
Get away from me! Get away
from me! Go play with the kids.

01:51:10.199 --> 01:51:12.827
<i>Tim, are you</i>
<i>asking me out on a date?</i>

01:51:12.935 --> 01:51:14.368
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>it to be a date?</i>

01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:16.267
<i>Hey, bro,</i>
<i>so your doctor called</i>

01:51:16.372 --> 01:51:19.671
<i>and he said it is contagious, but
only when inflamed, so you're cool.</i>

01:51:20.876 --> 01:51:22.309
<i>Also, I was trying</i>
<i>to do the laundry,</i>

01:51:22.411 --> 01:51:24.777
<i>but I think I need to get some</i>
<i>industrial-strength detergent.</i>

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.246
<i>What's up with all the skid
marks, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.?</i>

01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:29.978
<i>Wow, I think</i>
<i>I have a class.</i>

01:51:30.086 --> 01:51:31.383
You guys like this show?

01:51:31.487 --> 01:51:32.613
No!

01:51:32.722 --> 01:51:34.815
It's the worst show, ever.

01:51:34.924 --> 01:51:35.891
Good.

01:51:36.692 --> 01:51:38.626
Here you go.
We're finished with the French shit.

01:51:38.728 --> 01:51:40.286
We're into <i>española!</i>

01:51:40.396 --> 01:51:41.920
All right.

01:51:42.765 --> 01:51:44.426
China, man.
- Wow.

01:51:44.533 --> 01:51:47.297
And you guys never see each
other, huh? That must be rough.

01:51:47.403 --> 01:51:48.563
Right? Rough on the kids.

01:51:48.671 --> 01:51:51.834
It's not ideal, but the
kids like to eat, so...

01:51:53.576 --> 01:51:56.501
You ever see this girl act before?
She was quite the actress.

01:51:56.612 --> 01:51:58.477
Well, she's very good at
pretending she still loves me,

01:51:58.581 --> 01:52:00.173
so she's pretty
good then, isn't she?

01:52:00.282 --> 01:52:01.840
Yeah. I am.

01:52:03.018 --> 01:52:05.953
Can't say I watched much
of that <i>Melrose Place</i> stuff, though.

01:52:06.055 --> 01:52:07.750
Although I did see the <i>Party
of Five</i> episode you were in.

01:52:07.857 --> 01:52:09.825
It wasn't really
for me, you know.

01:52:10.025 --> 01:52:15.019
Well, it was down to me and Cameron Diaz
for the lead part in <i>The Mask.</i>

01:52:15.131 --> 01:52:17.224
Cameron Diaz!
That's my girl.

01:52:17.333 --> 01:52:19.301
She's a bloody top
actress, isn't she?

01:52:19.402 --> 01:52:22.132
Hey, what was that film she was in
with the bloody spuff in her hair?

01:52:22.304 --> 01:52:23.430
<i>Something About Mary!</i>

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.541
I love that movie!
She's so funny!

01:52:27.643 --> 01:52:29.440
Just about shit my
panties in that one.

01:52:29.645 --> 01:52:30.805
No, no, no, there's
not too many girls

01:52:30.913 --> 01:52:34.440
that are this beautiful
and sexy and funny and...

01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:35.812
She had the whole deal.

01:52:35.918 --> 01:52:41.322
Yes, but Cameron Diaz, fuck!
I mean, come on.

01:52:42.525 --> 01:52:43.583
See, if you had've
done that movie,

01:52:43.692 --> 01:52:45.216
you could have had the
bloody spuff in your hair.

01:52:45.327 --> 01:52:46.294
Look out.

01:52:46.395 --> 01:52:47.362
What are you giving
me the evil eyes for?

01:52:47.463 --> 01:52:48.589
You're such
a dick sometimes.

01:52:48.697 --> 01:52:49.755
I'm not... Why?

01:52:49.865 --> 01:52:50.854
Because.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.833
I'm just saying you had
your crack, you had your go at it.

01:52:53.936 --> 01:52:55.767
I feel like I didn't
reach my potential that...

01:52:55.871 --> 01:52:57.133
Oh, please!

01:52:57.239 --> 01:52:58.206
Oh, please, what?

01:52:58.307 --> 01:52:59.433
I didn't reach
my potential, either!

01:52:59.542 --> 01:53:00.839
I could have been
playing footie!

01:53:00.943 --> 01:53:01.932
You weren't that good

01:53:02.044 --> 01:53:03.170
at playing footie.
I was.

01:53:03.279 --> 01:53:04.246
You weren't.

01:53:05.247 --> 01:53:08.648
You should thank me, George.
I took a bullet here for you.

01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:11.686
All right, on that note, I'm
gonna head back to Los Angeles.

01:53:11.787 --> 01:53:12.776
No, come on, stay.

01:53:12.888 --> 01:53:13.855
No, it's fine.
I'll split.

01:53:13.956 --> 01:53:14.980
It's early.
I've been here too long.

01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:16.284
Schmira! We just started a bottle.

01:53:16.392 --> 01:53:19.259
Nah, nah, nah. You guys
have been the best. Schmira!

01:53:19.361 --> 01:53:21.921
Thank you so much
for having us, guys. Oh!

01:53:22.064 --> 01:53:23.725
Shoot.
- Uh-oh! Look out.

01:53:23.833 --> 01:53:24.800
God, I'm sorry, guys.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:25.867
Someone's
had too much to drink.

01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:28.993
Oh, man, no. No, I just kicked your
pot by accident, that's all. I...

01:53:29.338 --> 01:53:31.203
Hold it together there,
Schmira. I'm just a... Oh, God.

01:53:31.307 --> 01:53:32.274
It's okay.

01:53:32.374 --> 01:53:33.534
You're staying here.
You're not driving.

01:53:33.642 --> 01:53:36.236
No way. We got a guest house,
two spare beds. Done.

01:53:36.345 --> 01:53:37.937
You two, plenty of room to stay.
- No, no. Ira can drive.

01:53:38.047 --> 01:53:39.412
He... You're fine
to drive, right, Ira?

01:53:39.515 --> 01:53:41.312
I am. I just kicked
your begonias, that's all.

01:53:41.417 --> 01:53:44.443
No way! I'm not having America's favorite
funnyman dead on the side of the road

01:53:44.553 --> 01:53:46.111
'cause Schmira here's
had too much to drink.

01:53:46.222 --> 01:53:47.348
George, you can
drive, right?

01:53:47.456 --> 01:53:49.481
Bullshit!
You're staying here.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:53.186
Plus, there's a game of Aussie-rules
footie on the dish tonight.

01:53:53.295 --> 01:53:54.660
Semi-final.
Saints versus Maggies.

01:53:54.763 --> 01:53:56.924
Not that American shit.
I want you to see it.

01:53:57.032 --> 01:54:00.058
One condition. You Aussie
pussies got any beer around here?

01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:01.796
Yes, it's on...

01:54:03.172 --> 01:54:04.196
Yes!

01:54:04.807 --> 01:54:06.798
Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're
a small fucker or a big fucker,

01:54:06.909 --> 01:54:09.070
you can play this game because
the small fuckers go in barreling

01:54:09.178 --> 01:54:11.009
and they can get the ball over
and the boys are scrambling.

01:54:11.113 --> 01:54:12.410
Now watch. The little
fuckers down there go.

01:54:12.515 --> 01:54:14.449
There they are.
Big fuckers smack them.

01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:16.984
Little fucker. Little fucker.
Off to a big fucker.

01:54:17.086 --> 01:54:20.681
Now he's gonna go down to another
big fucker. I hate that big fucker.

01:54:20.789 --> 01:54:21.756
Where are the black guys?

01:54:21.857 --> 01:54:23.290
This is...
There's a couple out there.

01:54:23.392 --> 01:54:24.791
I hate this team.
- Oh, yeah?

01:54:24.894 --> 01:54:26.361
Magpies.
Hate the Maggies!

01:54:26.462 --> 01:54:30.398
They're like... I don't know
what the equivalent in the NFL...

01:54:30.566 --> 01:54:35.003
No helmets. No fucking helmets
'cause they're real men. See?

01:54:35.104 --> 01:54:38.562
Love you. Just explaining the
game to them. They're loving it!

01:54:46.582 --> 01:54:48.072
Yeah, we gotta get
going, you know.

01:54:48.183 --> 01:54:50.151
Are you sure
you can't stay?

01:54:50.252 --> 01:54:51.810
We can't stay.
We can't stay.

01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:54.890
Yeah, it's my... It's my
grandmother's 85th birthday.

01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.957
We got family
coming in from all over.

01:54:56.058 --> 01:54:57.025
That's right.

01:54:57.126 --> 01:54:59.617
She just had a stroke.
In her leg.

01:54:59.728 --> 01:55:00.990
So, you know,
we gotta get back.

01:55:01.096 --> 01:55:02.063
Yeah.

01:55:02.164 --> 01:55:03.791
That's too bad
you guys can't stay.

01:55:03.899 --> 01:55:05.196
It is too bad.

01:55:05.401 --> 01:55:07.733
Well, I wish I could say I was
gonna see you again, George,

01:55:07.836 --> 01:55:09.770
but I can't really
say that, can I?

01:55:09.872 --> 01:55:12.170
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you can't.

01:55:12.274 --> 01:55:13.241
You don't have
to do that, honey.

01:55:13.342 --> 01:55:15.640
No, I do have to do
this, honey. I do.

01:55:15.744 --> 01:55:16.870
You know what, mate?

01:55:16.979 --> 01:55:20.346
If there's one thing I've learned
from my Buddhist friends, the Chinese,

01:55:20.449 --> 01:55:23.941
is to keep an open heart
and to speak the truth.

01:55:24.053 --> 01:55:27.955
So, what I want to say to
you, George, is thank you.

01:55:28.958 --> 01:55:32.792
Thank you for playing such
a big role in my wife's life.

01:55:34.396 --> 01:55:36.364
It's been great
getting to know you.

01:55:36.465 --> 01:55:41.368
And I wish you a peaceful journey from
here on in and over to the other side.

01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:42.630
Come here, mate.

01:55:42.738 --> 01:55:45.206
Okay, we're gonna
do this.

01:55:46.575 --> 01:55:48.634
Thank you. Thank
you for everything.

01:55:48.744 --> 01:55:49.711
All right.

01:55:49.812 --> 01:55:50.938
Thank you.

01:55:51.046 --> 01:55:53.276
All right,
I appreciate your having us.

01:55:53.382 --> 01:55:56.613
Don't worry, Daddy.
He's not sick anymore.

01:55:56.719 --> 01:55:57.947
Ira told us.

01:55:58.053 --> 01:55:59.213
I didn't say that.

01:55:59.321 --> 01:56:00.288
Yes, you did.
Yeah, you did.

01:56:00.389 --> 01:56:02.323
When we were coloring.
- No.

01:56:02.424 --> 01:56:03.448
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:56:03.559 --> 01:56:04.583
That's not true, girls.

01:56:04.693 --> 01:56:06.024
No, that's not true.
- I did not say that.

01:56:06.128 --> 01:56:07.425
I don't know what
they're talking about.

01:56:07.529 --> 01:56:08.757
Liar.

01:56:08.864 --> 01:56:10.729
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

01:56:10.833 --> 01:56:13.097
They were freaking out.
They were worried about George.

01:56:13.202 --> 01:56:15.295
I just said it so they wouldn't
be scared. It was just...

01:56:15.404 --> 01:56:16.803
Kids, go inside.

01:56:16.905 --> 01:56:18.839
Can we watch <i>Borat?</i>
- Yeah, you can.

01:56:18.941 --> 01:56:20.340
I don't wanna watch <i>Borat.</i>
- Yes, you... Come on.

01:56:20.442 --> 01:56:21.875
See you guys.

01:56:23.145 --> 01:56:26.171
What is going on around
here? Is that true?

01:56:26.281 --> 01:56:28.511
I never said that
he was feeling better.

01:56:28.617 --> 01:56:31.108
He just took some medicine
and it's looking good for him

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.619
because they can't
detect it in his blood,

01:56:32.721 --> 01:56:35.189
but that doesn't mean
that he's better.

01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:36.757
These things
are very tricky

01:56:36.859 --> 01:56:39.987
and he didn't want to tell anybody
because he didn't want to jinx it!

01:56:40.095 --> 01:56:41.460
Is that true that you
didn't want to jinx it?

01:56:41.563 --> 01:56:43.588
Yeah. No, no, no, I...
Yeah, I'm very superstitious.

01:56:43.699 --> 01:56:44.688
Mmm-hmm.

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.324
You're a terrible liar.

01:56:46.435 --> 01:56:51.338
No, nothing's going on around here!

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.874
It's completely innocent.

01:56:53.976 --> 01:56:55.409
I left me ring...
- What accent is that?

01:56:55.511 --> 01:56:57.445
...on the side table.
- Jamaican?

01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.873
Don't mock me.
I don't appreciate it.

01:57:00.382 --> 01:57:02.543
Lots of people
go to massage parlors.

01:57:02.651 --> 01:57:05.279
That doesn't mean I was
getting a rub-and-tug.

01:57:05.387 --> 01:57:10.791
Those hairs on me jacket must've
fallen off the waiter's pussy.

01:57:11.293 --> 01:57:12.885
What the hell has
gotten into you?

01:57:12.995 --> 01:57:15.225
I was at a footie game!

01:57:15.330 --> 01:57:16.922
Are you taking
the piss out of me?

01:57:17.032 --> 01:57:21.765
I would never lie
to you, mate. Oi?

01:57:22.771 --> 01:57:23.738
I'm not playing
this game with you.

01:57:23.839 --> 01:57:26.307
This is stupid.
What a stupid game!

01:57:27.176 --> 01:57:29.906
Clarke, let's tell
each other the truth.

01:57:30.879 --> 01:57:31.846
Just come clean with me.

01:57:31.947 --> 01:57:33.107
There's nothing to tell.

01:57:33.215 --> 01:57:34.204
There's nothing to tell?

01:57:34.316 --> 01:57:35.283
There's nothing to tell.

01:57:35.384 --> 01:57:39.081
You will never tell me the truth.
That is a pussy move!

01:57:39.188 --> 01:57:40.678
You know what?
I'm not doing this.

01:57:40.789 --> 01:57:43.986
I'm not being put on a cross
for something I didn't even do!

01:57:44.093 --> 01:57:45.253
Enjoy each other!

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.657
Go fuck your whores!

01:57:47.362 --> 01:57:49.830
"Go fuck your whores"?

01:57:57.673 --> 01:58:01.735
So, it's good that he left, and
this is a huge relief for me.

01:58:01.844 --> 01:58:03.869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:58:03.979 --> 01:58:08.541
I don't need to be in a marriage
that is like that, so I'm fine.

01:58:08.650 --> 01:58:11.949
I'm not worried about that.
I just want you to be okay.

01:58:12.054 --> 01:58:13.180
I would be scared
if I was you right now.

01:58:13.288 --> 01:58:14.277
Are you kidding me?

01:58:14.389 --> 01:58:15.515
This is what
needed to happen.

01:58:15.624 --> 01:58:17.057
I would run away.

01:58:17.159 --> 01:58:18.126
No, I'm staying here.

01:58:18.227 --> 01:58:19.194
Are you gonna run away?

01:58:19.294 --> 01:58:21.990
Where am I running to?
Only if you come with me.

01:58:22.097 --> 01:58:24.588
I really need
you around right now.

01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:25.689
Yeah. Yeah.

01:58:25.801 --> 01:58:26.859
Can you stay till Monday?

01:58:26.969 --> 01:58:28.266
Absolutely.

01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:30.770
Can't we just go and, like,
come back later, you know?

01:58:30.873 --> 01:58:32.864
I mean, if this is
meant to be, it'll be.

01:58:32.975 --> 01:58:34.567
We don't have to be
here right this second.

01:58:34.676 --> 01:58:35.643
Can't we just go?

01:58:35.744 --> 01:58:37.336
Man, I don't... I see...

01:58:37.446 --> 01:58:40.711
Jesus Christ, every instinct in my
body is telling me to leave here, too.

01:58:41.083 --> 01:58:42.050
Good.

01:58:42.151 --> 01:58:43.550
But that's what led me
to this shitty life.

01:58:43.652 --> 01:58:47.986
I gotta stay here. I gotta do
the right thing. I love her.

01:58:48.090 --> 01:58:52.618
Right now, her husband is gonna
come back and murder us, man!

01:58:52.728 --> 01:58:54.628
Did you see his arms?
They look like legs!

01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:56.220
Shut up.
Don't be an idiot.

01:58:56.331 --> 01:59:00.859
I'm not being an... Imagine that
you are a gigantic Australian man

01:59:01.003 --> 01:59:03.767
and someone came into your
home and fucked your wife.

01:59:03.872 --> 01:59:06.841
You would murder him and then you
would make a hat out of his skin

01:59:07.009 --> 01:59:08.840
'cause that's what
Australians do. Let's go!

01:59:09.077 --> 01:59:11.841
Ira, this is deep shit.
People get divorced.

01:59:11.947 --> 01:59:15.474
They make mistakes,
they change their lives.

01:59:16.718 --> 01:59:20.176
It's not that big of a deal.
She's married to an asshole.

01:59:20.289 --> 01:59:22.257
She seems like
a crazy actress, man.

01:59:22.357 --> 01:59:23.756
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

01:59:23.859 --> 01:59:25.486
Am I not allowed
to be happy or something?

01:59:25.594 --> 01:59:28.893
I've been living alone and
alone and alone. That's my life.

01:59:28.997 --> 01:59:30.430
This is the only girl
I've ever loved

01:59:30.532 --> 01:59:32.124
and I'm not supposed
to do anything about this?

01:59:32.968 --> 01:59:34.299
When am I supposed
to be happy?

01:59:34.403 --> 01:59:37.167
Why does everyone
else get to be happy?

01:59:37.272 --> 01:59:40.173
Look, George, I'm just gonna
tell you this, as a friend.

01:59:40.943 --> 01:59:43.639
From where I'm sitting
it seems like your happiness

01:59:43.745 --> 01:59:46.612
might be coming at the cost
of destroying this family.

01:59:47.583 --> 01:59:50.074
Okay, let me respond
to that, as your friend,

01:59:50.185 --> 01:59:52.517
and let you know
you're not my friend.

01:59:52.621 --> 01:59:54.555
You fucking work for me!

01:59:54.656 --> 01:59:59.116
I didn't ask for your advice! You're
overstepping your boundaries, man!

01:59:59.228 --> 02:00:01.389
Now go get me
a fucking Diet Coke!

02:00:01.496 --> 02:00:04.090
And remind yourself
that's what you do for me!

02:00:04.199 --> 02:00:05.461
Now get the fuck
out of here!

02:00:05.567 --> 02:00:06.534
Fine.

02:00:07.536 --> 02:00:10.437
Don't fucking leave! Sit down here!
I don't want to be alone.

02:00:10.539 --> 02:00:12.268
Okay, fine.

02:00:14.877 --> 02:00:15.844
<i>This is Mark.</i>

02:00:15.944 --> 02:00:17.502
Hey, Mark, it's Ira.
How's it going, man?

02:00:17.946 --> 02:00:20.847
Not too good. I didn't get the
part in the Tobey Maguire movie.

02:00:20.949 --> 02:00:23.247
<i>That doesn't matter. I have
a problem. I need help, okay?</i>

02:00:23.352 --> 02:00:24.478
<i>Where have you been?</i>

02:00:24.586 --> 02:00:27.316
I'm in Marin County.
Northern California.

02:00:27.422 --> 02:00:30.118
Listen, I...
I have to tell you something.

02:00:30.392 --> 02:00:32.053
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.127
Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

02:00:34.162 --> 02:00:35.527
The other night
I went out to drinks

02:00:35.631 --> 02:00:36.620
with the producers
of my show

02:00:36.732 --> 02:00:38.461
and Leo met up with us.

02:00:38.567 --> 02:00:40.762
And they were enamored by him and
they thought he was really funny.

02:00:40.869 --> 02:00:43.702
And they offered him a part on
<i>Yo Teach!</i> and he took it.

02:00:43.805 --> 02:00:46.239
I saw the episode.
I know that that happened.

02:00:46.341 --> 02:00:47.501
<i>You watched it?</i>
- I watched it.

02:00:47.609 --> 02:00:48.576
<i>Did you love it?</i>

02:00:49.311 --> 02:00:51.176
Yeah.
He was great, right?

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.180
<i>It was fine!</i>
<i>I have no problem with Leo, okay?</i>

02:00:53.282 --> 02:00:54.374
<i>Tell Leo, if he's</i>
<i>got a problem,</i>

02:00:54.483 --> 02:00:56.781
<i>to stop being a baby</i>
<i>and to just get over it!</i>

02:00:56.885 --> 02:00:57.909
Why don't you
tell Leo yourself?

02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.045
'Cause Leo's been surveilling
this whole conversation.

02:01:00.355 --> 02:01:01.413
You dick.
<i>- Fucking asshole.</i>

02:01:01.523 --> 02:01:03.320
<i>Leo, get off the phone!</i>
Screw you, Leo. Screw you.

02:01:03.425 --> 02:01:04.790
Hey, man what have
you been up to?

02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:06.190
Sucking George
Simmons' balls?

02:01:06.295 --> 02:01:08.559
That's cool. I've been on
<i>Yo Teach!</i> living it up.

02:01:08.664 --> 02:01:10.154
I'm sorry, Leo.
<i>Yo Teach!</i> sucks.

02:01:10.265 --> 02:01:11.357
<i>Go lose some</i>
<i>more weight, Ira!</i>

02:01:11.466 --> 02:01:12.490
<i>You look fucking</i>
<i>weird skinny!</i>

02:01:13.068 --> 02:01:14.399
<i>Leo, calm down!</i>

02:01:14.503 --> 02:01:16.767
You know what, Ira? I want to
put my eyeglasses on your asshole

02:01:16.872 --> 02:01:19.705
so it looks like you're blowing me when
I'm fucking you in the ass, you jerk!

02:01:19.808 --> 02:01:20.775
<i>That doesn't even make sense!</i>

02:01:20.876 --> 02:01:23.174
<i>You're gonna put glasses</i>
<i>on my ass? What?</i>

02:01:23.278 --> 02:01:27.180
Ira, we will find something
for you to do on the show, okay?

02:01:27.282 --> 02:01:28.749
Teach can have
more than one friend.

02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:30.078
Can we talk
about this later?

02:01:30.185 --> 02:01:32.983
I am in a serious problem. I just
need some advice, okay? Please?

02:01:33.088 --> 02:01:36.580
Just listen to me for two minutes and
tell me what I should do right now, okay?

02:01:36.692 --> 02:01:37.784
Will you do that?

02:01:37.893 --> 02:01:40.589
All right. If it's serious,
I'm sorry. I will listen.

02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:44.030
Okay. Here's what's happening.

02:01:44.132 --> 02:01:45.929
<i>I'm witnessing</i>
<i>a slow-moving train wreck,</i>

02:01:46.034 --> 02:01:48.059
<i>but if I do something,</i>
<i>I will lose my job.</i>

02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:49.137
Are you serious?

02:01:49.237 --> 02:01:50.636
<i>So, what</i>
<i>I don't know, is...</i>

02:01:50.939 --> 02:01:53.032
Screw you.

02:01:54.576 --> 02:01:55.570
Higher!
Higher!

02:01:55.677 --> 02:01:56.666
I can't. I... I can't.
- Yes, you can.

02:01:56.778 --> 02:01:58.245
You, you have to go
down a little bit then

02:01:58.347 --> 02:02:00.042
through the middle.
- Be careful. Don't let him fall on you.

02:02:00.148 --> 02:02:01.115
Where do I put my hand?

02:02:01.917 --> 02:02:06.820
I spoke to Clarke. He's gonna be at the
airport tonight heading back to China.

02:02:06.955 --> 02:02:09.515
I'm gonna go tell him
that when he comes back

02:02:09.758 --> 02:02:12.192
he should find
another place to live.

02:02:12.294 --> 02:02:13.522
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. What...

02:02:13.628 --> 02:02:16.392
You... Yeah? Good. Good. Yeah.

02:02:16.832 --> 02:02:17.821
You're gonna tell him?

02:02:17.933 --> 02:02:19.298
I just don't want
him coming back here.

02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:20.663
You don't need him.
- No.

02:02:20.769 --> 02:02:22.828
That'll just
get you sick.

02:02:22.938 --> 02:02:25.805
Good, you gotta tell him.
So, when are you doing that?

02:02:25.907 --> 02:02:26.874
Tonight?
- Yeah.

02:02:27.009 --> 02:02:27.976
Okay, okay,
I'm coming down.

02:02:28.076 --> 02:02:29.043
Jump!

02:02:29.978 --> 02:02:31.002
I talked to a girlfriend of mine,

02:02:31.113 --> 02:02:33.172
and she has somebody
who could show us

02:02:33.348 --> 02:02:35.441
some houses down
in Los Angeles.

02:02:35.817 --> 02:02:37.011
And we'll get that
whole thing going.

02:02:37.119 --> 02:02:41.556
And then I was thinking about
taking the kids out of school now,

02:02:41.656 --> 02:02:44.750
but we should probably let them
finish up because it's December.

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:46.384
And I don't want
to mess everything up.

02:02:46.495 --> 02:02:48.292
They have to finish
the whole year here.

02:02:48.397 --> 02:02:49.796
Yeah, that makes sense to
me. So, if we just go down

02:02:49.898 --> 02:02:51.195
at the beginning
of the summer,

02:02:51.299 --> 02:02:52.630
let them kind of transit.
I'm supposed to do

02:02:52.734 --> 02:02:54.258
a little two-week
tour this summer.

02:02:54.369 --> 02:02:56.667
I'm supposed to do it,
but I don't need to do it.

02:02:56.838 --> 02:03:00.274
No pressure on you. Look at
you! There's no pressure on you.

02:03:00.375 --> 02:03:04.505
I need to work and I want to
get my acting career going again.

02:03:04.613 --> 02:03:06.342
Good.
- Yeah.

02:03:06.448 --> 02:03:09.008
She's whupping you, Ingrid!
Good job there, Lulu.

02:03:10.285 --> 02:03:11.980
So, she's gonna go
to the airport tonight

02:03:12.087 --> 02:03:14.988
and tell Clarke that she wants
him to find a new place and...

02:03:16.258 --> 02:03:18.249
What do you
think of that?

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.521
I don't want to tell
you what I think about that

02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:22.153
'cause I don't want
to get yelled at, George.

02:03:22.264 --> 02:03:23.754
Oh, God.

02:03:23.865 --> 02:03:26.527
I'm just nervous about the kids
and, like, who's gonna get them

02:03:26.635 --> 02:03:28.796
and does he get one
and Laura gets one,

02:03:28.904 --> 02:03:30.496
or am I gonna
have both of them?

02:03:30.605 --> 02:03:32.630
'Cause I love the little
one, we kind of click.

02:03:32.741 --> 02:03:36.507
But the older one is, like, you
sense the period's coming soon.

02:03:36.611 --> 02:03:38.272
I think she would
probably get the kids.

02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:39.369
All right, yeah.

02:03:39.481 --> 02:03:41.574
I don't think you can
have two girls in China.

02:03:41.716 --> 02:03:43.183
What are you gonna do now?
Look at this crew.

02:03:43.285 --> 02:03:44.547
Why so close?
Really?

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:47.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:03:47.489 --> 02:03:49.116
You okay, little girl?
You okay?

02:03:49.224 --> 02:03:50.623
Oh, man.
Are you okay?

02:03:50.759 --> 02:03:52.351
Okay. I'm gonna show
you Mable singing...

02:03:52.461 --> 02:03:53.450
Mom, you make
everybody see...

02:03:53.562 --> 02:03:55.723
No, <i>Memory</i> from <i>Cats.</i>
Come on! It's...

02:03:55.897 --> 02:03:57.524
No. I hate that you
show it to everyone.

02:03:57.632 --> 02:03:59.122
I'll just show
them the end part.

02:04:01.103 --> 02:04:03.469
I'll just show you
the ending. Okay.

02:04:17.752 --> 02:04:23.748
<i> Burnt-out ends</i>
<i>of smoky days</i>

02:04:24.626 --> 02:04:30.496
<i>The stale cold smell</i>
<i>of morning</i>

02:04:31.933 --> 02:04:38.634
<i>The streetlamp dies,</i>
<i>another night is over</i>

02:04:39.141 --> 02:04:44.306
<i>Another day is dawning</i>

02:04:46.748 --> 02:04:49.308
<i>Touch me</i>

02:04:49.484 --> 02:04:55.912
<i>It's so easy to leave me</i>
<i>All alone with the memory</i>

02:04:56.625 --> 02:04:59.651
<i>Of my days in the sun</i>

02:05:01.029 --> 02:05:05.125
<i>If you touch me</i>
<i>You'll understand what happiness is</i>

02:05:08.703 --> 02:05:14.664
<i>Look, a new day has begun</i>

02:05:22.551 --> 02:05:23.518
That was unbelievable!

02:05:23.618 --> 02:05:25.279
Isn't that good?

02:05:26.922 --> 02:05:28.856
That was insane!

02:05:28.957 --> 02:05:32.825
That was like just seeing a little
person sing an old person's song.

02:05:32.928 --> 02:05:34.759
That was hysterical!

02:05:34.896 --> 02:05:38.696
I got a friend who takes...
He takes a lot of acid.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:41.394
If he saw that,
he would shit himself!

02:05:43.004 --> 02:05:44.232
That's not supposed
to be funny.

02:05:44.339 --> 02:05:45.306
I know, I know,
I know. I'm...

02:05:45.407 --> 02:05:47.568
No, I think that's
why it's funnier.

02:05:47.676 --> 02:05:48.643
It was so amazing.

02:05:48.743 --> 02:05:49.710
Wasn't that good?

02:05:49.811 --> 02:05:51.472
I think I started
crying a little bit.

02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:54.549
Me, too. I cry
every time I see that.

02:05:56.651 --> 02:05:59.313
That shit was funny up there.

02:05:59.421 --> 02:06:03.255
Okay. Wow, these guys are not
gonna take no for an answer.

02:06:04.092 --> 02:06:06.219
Yeah. They want me to do
another baby movie.

02:06:06.328 --> 02:06:08.956
They keep bumping up
the gross on the DVDs.

02:06:09.097 --> 02:06:11.725
I just...
There's no way I'm doing it.

02:06:18.406 --> 02:06:19.703
Okay. Bye.

02:06:24.879 --> 02:06:26.938
Hey, George.

02:06:27.048 --> 02:06:28.379
Yeah.

02:06:28.483 --> 02:06:30.212
I'm going to...
I'm gonna go to the store

02:06:30.318 --> 02:06:31.478
and grab some
cigarettes, okay?

02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.712
I'll be back soon.

02:06:32.821 --> 02:06:35.085
What? What do you
need cigarettes for?

02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:36.680
'Cause I'm addicted to them.

02:06:36.791 --> 02:06:38.759
Why? 'Cause you look like
the Fonz when you smoke?

02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:41.556
I've always smoked. I just didn't do
it in front of you 'cause you were sick.

02:06:41.663 --> 02:06:43.187
And now that you're better...

02:06:43.298 --> 02:06:45.892
Hurry up, though, man.
I'm running out of gas with the kids here.

02:06:46.001 --> 02:06:47.229
Okay. I'll hurry up.

02:06:48.036 --> 02:06:53.736
<i>Memory,</i>
<i>all alone in the moonlight</i>

02:06:55.677 --> 02:06:58.908
<i>I can't wait</i>
<i>till the morning</i>

02:07:09.724 --> 02:07:12.090
Are my parents getting a divorce?

02:07:15.096 --> 02:07:17.564
Why... Why...
Why do you ask that?

02:07:18.199 --> 02:07:21.862
Just, like, I can tell.
They're always fighting and...

02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:23.997
How does that make you feel?

02:07:24.105 --> 02:07:26.232
Well, he's already away a lot,

02:07:26.341 --> 02:07:30.539
so it doesn't really
matter that much, but...

02:07:30.979 --> 02:07:32.537
Uh-huh.

02:07:32.647 --> 02:07:34.581
That wouldn't be fun.

02:07:34.683 --> 02:07:37.413
Maybe it would be better
if they were separated.

02:07:37.519 --> 02:07:38.508
Mmm-mmm.

02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:39.917
No?

02:07:40.021 --> 02:07:41.454
That's not good.

02:07:41.556 --> 02:07:42.523
Right.

02:08:04.379 --> 02:08:05.539
Clarke?

02:08:07.415 --> 02:08:11.511
Laura, what are you doing here?

02:08:11.619 --> 02:08:13.450
I don't know.

02:08:13.955 --> 02:08:17.755
<i>Mr. Way Chen, you need to get to
the information desk. Thank you.</i>

02:08:20.729 --> 02:08:21.696
<i>You've reached Ira.</i>

02:08:21.796 --> 02:08:22.888
<i>Please leave me a message.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:08:24.099 --> 02:08:25.828
Where are you?
You gotta come back here.

02:08:25.934 --> 02:08:28.869
I think I'm getting...
I'm getting lonely here.

02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:31.939
<i>I need some help.</i>
<i>Just, seriously, hurry up.</i>

02:08:32.907 --> 02:08:36.638
I don't trust you.
Am I imagining things?

02:08:38.179 --> 02:08:40.374
You're not imagining
anything, honey.

02:08:41.649 --> 02:08:44.641
Two times.
That's all I did was two times.

02:08:44.753 --> 02:08:47.221
And I don't want to ruin everything
just 'cause of two fucking times.

02:08:47.322 --> 02:08:48.949
She couldn't even speak English.

02:08:53.027 --> 02:08:55.018
Look at our life.
You're driving the kids to school.

02:08:55.130 --> 02:08:57.064
You're picking them up.
You're like a single mother.

02:08:57.165 --> 02:08:59.963
And you're not a single mom.
You're my wife. You're my baby.

02:09:00.068 --> 02:09:02.730
I shouldn't be in China

02:09:02.837 --> 02:09:06.102
trying to sell Oreos to people who
don't want to fucking talk to me.

02:09:06.207 --> 02:09:09.199
I'm gonna get a normal job.
I'm gonna be just around the corner.

02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:11.972
It's just gonna be
you, me and the kids.

02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:15.008
All I want is a fresh start.

02:09:15.116 --> 02:09:16.083
Yeah.

02:09:23.825 --> 02:09:25.224
Oh.

02:09:25.326 --> 02:09:26.293
Yeah.

02:09:30.365 --> 02:09:32.959
The George Simmons thing
was just a flirtation.

02:09:33.067 --> 02:09:37.026
It was nothing. He really
was sick. He just got better.

02:09:38.072 --> 02:09:39.903
I'm so fucking glad.
- Yeah.

02:09:40.008 --> 02:09:43.239
I really like him. I do.
I don't want to hate him.

02:09:44.245 --> 02:09:46.042
I fucking love you.

02:09:54.322 --> 02:09:55.346
Ira!

02:09:57.826 --> 02:09:59.521
Hey!

02:09:59.627 --> 02:10:00.594
What are you doing here?

02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:04.294
I'm going back to Los Angeles.

02:10:05.099 --> 02:10:06.066
LA?

02:10:06.167 --> 02:10:07.395
Yeah.

02:10:07.502 --> 02:10:09.561
You're in the Great China Air
First Class Lounge, mate.

02:10:09.671 --> 02:10:10.638
What are you doing?

02:10:10.738 --> 02:10:14.037
Oh. Shit, this is a
confusing airport.

02:10:14.175 --> 02:10:16.905
I thought this
was Panda Express.

02:10:17.011 --> 02:10:19.707
Well, it's good to
see you guys, though.

02:10:19.814 --> 02:10:22.908
What's going on?
Laura?

02:10:23.017 --> 02:10:26.145
What the hell is going on?

02:10:26.254 --> 02:10:27.744
Uh... Ask her.

02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:30.720
I was so mad at you for the
way that you've been treating me

02:10:30.825 --> 02:10:33.851
that I was on my way
here to tell you tonight

02:10:33.995 --> 02:10:35.963
to find another place
to live when you got back.

02:10:36.064 --> 02:10:37.292
But then...
I came here to stop her.

02:10:37.398 --> 02:10:38.422
Shut the fuck up.

02:10:38.533 --> 02:10:41.525
I slept with George once,
but it's over.

02:10:41.636 --> 02:10:44.230
It's done.
And it was no big deal.

02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.001
We didn't even have sex.
He just went down on me.

02:10:49.110 --> 02:10:50.577
That's worse.

02:10:50.678 --> 02:10:51.667
Crikey.

02:10:51.779 --> 02:10:54.247
He manipulated me
with his disease!

02:10:56.050 --> 02:10:58.644
Where is he?
George, where is he?

02:10:58.753 --> 02:11:00.186
He's at your house.

02:11:00.288 --> 02:11:02.916
He's at our house?
With our kids?

02:11:03.625 --> 02:11:05.252
Please don't get
that look on your face.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:06.691
Please don't get
that look on your face.

02:11:06.794 --> 02:11:07.818
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna kill him.

02:11:07.929 --> 02:11:10.022
No, no, no, no, no.

02:11:10.131 --> 02:11:11.598
I'm sorry.

02:11:11.699 --> 02:11:12.688
You're sorry?

02:11:12.834 --> 02:11:14.062
I came here to stop...
Who are you?

02:11:14.168 --> 02:11:15.294
I don't know.
Who are you?

02:11:15.403 --> 02:11:17.030
What are you doing here?

02:11:17.138 --> 02:11:18.503
I was trying to help you.

02:11:18.606 --> 02:11:20.073
Get the fuck out of my life!

02:11:20.174 --> 02:11:21.835
Okay.

02:11:21.943 --> 02:11:26.642
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:11:26.748 --> 02:11:32.709
Where is it? Where is it?
Oh, God, where is it?

02:11:32.954 --> 02:11:36.856
So stupid! Stupid shit!

02:11:40.461 --> 02:11:43.825
<i>I wanted to tell you I miss you.
I miss your kisses.</i>

02:11:43.932 --> 02:11:47.595
<i>I miss your short skirts.</i>
<i>And I miss your smell.</i>

02:11:50.805 --> 02:11:52.295
<i>Get the BabyBjörn.</i>

02:11:52.407 --> 02:11:54.898
<i>We're gonna go find that wizard.</i>

02:11:55.009 --> 02:11:57.773
Hey, girls.
You look so cute.

02:11:58.846 --> 02:12:00.438
You, outside.

02:12:00.548 --> 02:12:01.515
Is he in trouble?

02:12:01.616 --> 02:12:02.742
Yes.

02:12:09.557 --> 02:12:11.115
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.

02:12:11.225 --> 02:12:12.556
What do you think I did?

02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:13.649
Oh, shit!

02:12:13.761 --> 02:12:15.592
Your friend sold you out, mate!

02:12:15.697 --> 02:12:16.686
No, no, no, Clarke!

02:12:16.798 --> 02:12:18.493
You think this is a game?
Stop it!

02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:19.567
What'd you think
you were gonna do?

02:12:19.667 --> 02:12:21.498
Come in and just
fuck up my family?

02:12:21.603 --> 02:12:23.332
- Stop it!
- Is that what you thought?

02:12:23.438 --> 02:12:24.427
Stop it. Stop.
No, no, no, no!

02:12:24.539 --> 02:12:26.370
I didn't fucking do anything!
This sort of shit I kill for!

02:12:26.474 --> 02:12:27.771
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!

02:12:27.875 --> 02:12:29.365
You stupid shit!

02:12:29.477 --> 02:12:30.444
No!

02:12:30.545 --> 02:12:31.534
Fuck, man!

02:12:31.646 --> 02:12:33.273
Come here!
Run, George!

02:12:33.381 --> 02:12:35.508
Don't hurt him, you maniac!

02:12:36.684 --> 02:12:37.946
Cut the shit, guys!

02:12:38.052 --> 02:12:39.019
Stop it!

02:12:40.388 --> 02:12:43.551
Run, George! You're cornering
yourself! Go that way!

02:12:43.658 --> 02:12:44.989
Get away from me!
Take it like a man, George!

02:12:45.093 --> 02:12:46.958
Get away from me,
you fucking crazy asshole!

02:12:47.061 --> 02:12:49.791
You fucking asshole!
Get away!

02:12:51.099 --> 02:12:52.589
Oh, my God.

02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:54.691
She's not happy with you!

02:12:54.802 --> 02:12:57.566
No one who's married
is happy, you idiot!

02:12:58.406 --> 02:13:00.738
Get in a ball, George!
Get in a ball!

02:13:00.842 --> 02:13:02.469
Fight like a man!
Get on your feet, would you?

02:13:02.577 --> 02:13:05.546
I don't know how to fight!
I'm a comedian, you fucking asshole!

02:13:05.647 --> 02:13:06.614
Should I jump in?

02:13:06.714 --> 02:13:08.409
No! No! Don't jump in!

02:13:08.516 --> 02:13:10.484
Just get away from me, man!
You traitor!

02:13:10.585 --> 02:13:12.644
Go get more cigarettes,
you liar!

02:13:12.754 --> 02:13:13.982
I accomplished nothing!

02:13:14.088 --> 02:13:15.988
They made up
before I got there!

02:13:17.225 --> 02:13:19.193
Where's your
helmet now, Yankee?

02:13:19.293 --> 02:13:21.761
Let's talk! Clarke!

02:13:21.863 --> 02:13:23.455
Clarke, no!

02:13:23.564 --> 02:13:25.395
Come on, pussy!

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:26.467
Help!

02:13:27.535 --> 02:13:28.729
All right!

02:13:28.836 --> 02:13:29.825
Stop!

02:13:29.937 --> 02:13:31.666
I got him! I got him!
You don't want this, Schmira.

02:13:31.773 --> 02:13:33.502
You don't want
a piece of me, Schmira!

02:13:33.608 --> 02:13:35.269
I am gonna love this!

02:13:36.844 --> 02:13:38.209
God!

02:13:38.312 --> 02:13:40.940
You son of a bitch! I knew
you didn't want me to be happy!

02:13:41.049 --> 02:13:44.143
What are you doing, man?
Look at this! You fucking suck!

02:13:44.252 --> 02:13:45.685
You've gone crazy!
You're a lightweight...

02:13:45.787 --> 02:13:46.913
Get away from me, man!

02:13:47.021 --> 02:13:49.489
...named Ira Wiener!
Ira Wiener!

02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:51.524
You should have died!
Well, I ain't going nowhere!

02:13:51.626 --> 02:13:53.184
I'm never gonna die!
I hope you die!

02:13:53.294 --> 02:13:55.023
I'm never gonna die, baby!
- Die!

02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:56.323
Boys, stop it!
- I hope you die! I hate you!

02:13:56.431 --> 02:13:57.864
I know what you're trying
to do, the pair of you!

02:13:57.965 --> 02:13:59.933
You're trying to distract me
so I won't hit him!

02:14:00.034 --> 02:14:01.331
Lackey! Lackey!

02:14:01.436 --> 02:14:02.425
Wait!

02:14:02.537 --> 02:14:04.505
Oh, shit, Clarke! Dude!

02:14:04.605 --> 02:14:05.833
Are you okay, George?

02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:07.737
Where's your stunt man now, hey?

02:14:07.842 --> 02:14:08.809
Stop it!

02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:11.344
Will you stop hitting me?

02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:15.040
I'm better now,
but it can come back!

02:14:16.751 --> 02:14:19.185
Laura, tell him.
Tell him what you told me.

02:14:19.721 --> 02:14:23.157
Tell him that you love me more
than you love him. Tell him!

02:14:23.391 --> 02:14:24.517
Yeah, when she
told you that,

02:14:24.625 --> 02:14:26.752
did she think
you were dying, huh?

02:14:27.495 --> 02:14:30.020
Tell him. Tell him.
Is it me or him?

02:14:33.067 --> 02:14:34.398
Him.

02:14:34.502 --> 02:14:38.836
What? Come on!
Are you serious?

02:14:39.807 --> 02:14:42.867
He's my husband.
We have a family.

02:14:43.778 --> 02:14:45.245
I love him.

02:14:45.713 --> 02:14:48.978
And you didn't even cry
when Mable sang <i>Cats.</i>

02:14:49.584 --> 02:14:51.142
What's the matter with you?

02:14:51.853 --> 02:14:54.219
I didn't want to lie.
I don't know.

02:14:54.322 --> 02:14:56.654
I've seen it
on Broadway before.

02:14:57.992 --> 02:14:59.960
It wasn't as good as it.

02:15:01.596 --> 02:15:03.826
What are you guys
doing on the lawn?

02:15:03.931 --> 02:15:05.489
I'm hungry!

02:15:06.234 --> 02:15:09.294
Nothing. We're just...
We're just mucking around.

02:15:09.403 --> 02:15:11.428
Come on. Go back inside.

02:15:17.779 --> 02:15:21.840
Sorry, George.
I'll always love you.

02:15:22.884 --> 02:15:25.079
But what are we gonna do?

02:15:25.186 --> 02:15:26.653
I love you.

02:15:27.555 --> 02:15:29.887
I'm sorry I came up here.
I shouldn't have come.

02:15:31.058 --> 02:15:32.685
No, I'm glad you did.

02:15:33.928 --> 02:15:35.623
Maybe when we're 70?

02:15:37.965 --> 02:15:40.092
I hope you find
a way to be happy.

02:15:40.635 --> 02:15:43.570
Shit. He's coming back.
He's coming back. Let's go.

02:15:44.272 --> 02:15:45.637
Clarke.

02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:49.506
You know what? I've just worked
out why all this shit has happened.

02:15:49.610 --> 02:15:51.805
In the East,
they call this karma.

02:15:51.913 --> 02:15:56.077
And I have brought all this
shit upon us with my misbehavior.

02:15:56.184 --> 02:15:58.277
That's why all this
shit has happened.

02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.581
This had to happen.

02:16:01.355 --> 02:16:03.619
But some good shit's
gonna come from this.

02:16:04.091 --> 02:16:06.559
We have to learn from this,
you know, all of us.

02:16:06.661 --> 02:16:08.595
There's a good lesson here.

02:16:10.031 --> 02:16:12.591
Underneath anger is hurt,

02:16:13.668 --> 02:16:17.001
but underneath hurt is love.

02:16:17.738 --> 02:16:19.137
You feel it?

02:16:22.343 --> 02:16:23.571
Okay?

02:16:23.678 --> 02:16:24.702
Yeah. Thank you.

02:16:24.812 --> 02:16:25.801
I'm sorry about this.

02:16:25.913 --> 02:16:28.848
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

02:16:44.866 --> 02:16:45.889
Do you want me to drive?

02:16:47.101 --> 02:16:50.228
No, you don't have to drive me.
I'll drive myself.

02:16:51.239 --> 02:16:55.471
In fact, you're never gonna have to
drive me again because you're fired, Ira.

02:16:55.877 --> 02:16:58.107
You're the only person
that I've ever heard of

02:16:58.212 --> 02:17:00.305
that learned nothing from a
near-death experience, George.

02:17:00.414 --> 02:17:02.005
You went backwards.
You're worse.

02:17:02.116 --> 02:17:04.311
You know what I am?
A good friend.

02:17:04.418 --> 02:17:07.876
I would never run to the
airport and rat somebody out.

02:17:07.989 --> 02:17:11.652
I don't have that in my DNA.
That's not a friend, man.

02:17:11.759 --> 02:17:14.091
A friend tells you.
A friend comes up to you and says,

02:17:14.195 --> 02:17:16.322
"Hey, you're in a heap of shit.
You better not do it."

02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:19.422
He doesn't run
and tell the fucking girl.

02:17:19.532 --> 02:17:20.557
Well...
- Wow.

02:17:20.668 --> 02:17:22.727
Good. Fire me. I don't want
to be around you anymore,

02:17:22.837 --> 02:17:24.964
'cause you are
fucking contagious!

02:17:25.072 --> 02:17:27.302
You think I can't
get another assistant?

02:17:27.407 --> 02:17:29.968
I can't get someone else
to write jokes for me?

02:17:30.076 --> 02:17:33.911
You think I'm gonna lay in my bed
going, "Aw, I miss my Schmira"?

02:17:34.482 --> 02:17:37.450
You're a fucking no-thought.
That's the beauty.

02:17:37.550 --> 02:17:40.246
Once you're gone it never
comes back in my brain.

02:17:40.353 --> 02:17:41.878
You think getting Laura
would have made you happy?

02:17:41.989 --> 02:17:43.820
I know so. You think if
you had a family right now,

02:17:43.924 --> 02:17:45.187
you would be happy?

02:17:45.293 --> 02:17:48.490
You'll never be happy, 'cause you're
always gonna be stuck with yourself!

02:17:48.596 --> 02:17:51.656
Unless somehow you can
get away from you,

02:17:51.766 --> 02:17:54.200
you're always gonna
be miserable, George.

02:17:54.302 --> 02:17:56.326
You are not funny.

02:17:56.437 --> 02:17:58.530
Well, if that means
I'm less like you,

02:17:58.638 --> 02:18:00.937
then good, I don't
want to be funny, okay?

02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:03.477
Mission accomplished, Ira.

02:18:04.978 --> 02:18:06.537
Bad career choice.

02:18:07.214 --> 02:18:10.308
Comedy usually
is for funny people.

02:18:10.418 --> 02:18:11.646
Gotcha.

02:19:11.111 --> 02:19:13.602
<i>Chances are you've got a lot of stuff
stuffed in your drawers and closets</i>

02:19:13.714 --> 02:19:14.702
<i>that you don't really need.</i>

02:19:14.815 --> 02:19:17.511

02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:30.822
Good morning. Hi.

02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:35.164
I think I'm gonna
forgive him today.

02:19:35.269 --> 02:19:36.600
What? Really?
- Yeah.

02:19:36.704 --> 02:19:38.865
Great!
That's great news!

02:19:38.973 --> 02:19:41.532
He's just gonna be so jealous that
I'm on <i>Yo Teach!</i> You know?

02:19:41.642 --> 02:19:43.575
I just figured it'd
be a cool thing to do.

02:19:43.677 --> 02:19:46.611
Well, maybe we could
find something for him.

02:19:47.114 --> 02:19:51.175
You know, if it comes up organically,
definitely, but we shouldn't force it.

02:19:51.285 --> 02:19:52.479
You know?
- Right.

02:19:52.586 --> 02:19:54.577
I don't want to be
on <i>Yo Teach!</i>

02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:57.382
It's okay.
I forgave you, you know?

02:19:57.491 --> 02:19:58.583
Thank you.

02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:03.560
So, how'd everything go
up there this weekend?

02:20:04.265 --> 02:20:09.293
I think I did the right thing, but George
fired me and punched me in the face.

02:20:11.272 --> 02:20:12.864
You want to talk about it?

02:20:12.973 --> 02:20:13.940
No.

02:20:15.443 --> 02:20:18.810
I kind of wish you would.
It sounds like the greatest story, ever.

02:20:20.548 --> 02:20:22.880
Wake me up at 2:00.
I'll tell you about it.

02:20:23.951 --> 02:20:26.545
Well, we're glad you're back.

02:20:26.654 --> 02:20:27.951
Glad you're home.

02:20:28.055 --> 02:20:30.580
I can't believe I have
to start all over again.

02:20:31.759 --> 02:20:34.353
Hey, man, how you doing?

02:20:34.695 --> 02:20:35.923
Hey, how you doing?
Heard you were sick.

02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:37.827
You feeling better now?
- Over here!

02:20:37.932 --> 02:20:40.423
George, second lease on life.
What are you gonna do now?

02:20:40.534 --> 02:20:41.592
Hey, guys, come on.
Come on, I heard rumors

02:20:41.702 --> 02:20:43.067
about another baby movie.
What do you got, huh?

02:20:43.170 --> 02:20:45.161
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna shoot that.
That should be good.

02:20:45.272 --> 02:20:47.206
Gonna start that in a little bit.
Let me get by you, though.

02:20:59.587 --> 02:21:01.214
It's nice up here, huh?

02:21:01.322 --> 02:21:03.415
Yeah.
How'd you find it?

02:21:04.625 --> 02:21:07.423
Me and my friends, we hike
up here and I always thought,

02:21:07.528 --> 02:21:08.654
"You know, that'd be
a great place to take

02:21:08.762 --> 02:21:11.253
"a woman if you...
If you knew one."

02:21:12.466 --> 02:21:13.524
Well, now you know one.

02:21:13.634 --> 02:21:14.658
Good.

02:21:30.251 --> 02:21:31.275
Hey, I'm gonna give him the light.

02:21:31.385 --> 02:21:32.352
Thanks, Mark.

02:21:34.255 --> 02:21:35.916
Bailey, you're number two.

02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:44.661
Hey, Ira.
How you doing?

02:21:44.765 --> 02:21:45.732
Good. How you doing?

02:21:45.833 --> 02:21:46.891
Wassup, big money?

02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:48.127
You guys know each other?

02:21:48.235 --> 02:21:50.669
Yes. I've seen this
young Jewish comedian.

02:21:51.238 --> 02:21:52.899
Randy, what's happening?

02:21:53.007 --> 02:21:56.170
I saw this cat down at Otto's
yesterday. Made me a little panini.

02:21:57.111 --> 02:21:59.636
Grilled chicken pesto.
Shit was nice.

02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.241
Yeah, I'm working at Otto's again.

02:22:03.217 --> 02:22:04.616
So, you're going up?

02:22:04.952 --> 02:22:07.546
Yeah, I'm about to go up now.
See you guys.

02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:10.416
Later!

02:22:12.226 --> 02:22:14.490
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

02:22:14.595 --> 02:22:18.053
<i>My friends are very sexually
aggressive, which is hard for me.</i>

02:22:18.165 --> 02:22:19.962
<i>You know, we'll watch
television and they'll just see...</i>

02:22:20.067 --> 02:22:21.967
<i>A hot girl will come on</i>
<i>and they'll just be,</i>

02:22:22.069 --> 02:22:25.527
<i>" Man, I wanna fuck the shit</i>
<i>out of that girl, man!</i>

02:22:25.639 --> 02:22:27.334
<i>" I'm gonna</i>
<i>fuck that girl!"</i>

02:22:27.441 --> 02:22:28.601
<i>And I, like,</i>
<i>can't even say that.</i>

02:22:28.709 --> 02:22:30.199
<i>I can't even pretend</i>
<i>I would do that.</i>

02:22:30.311 --> 02:22:31.676
<i>I see a hot girl</i>
<i>on TV and I'm like,</i>

02:22:31.779 --> 02:22:35.112
<i>" Man, I would friend</i>
<i>the shit out of her!</i>

02:22:36.317 --> 02:22:41.118
<i>" I'd friend her all night!</i>
<i>I would be her girlfriend!</i>

02:22:41.622 --> 02:22:44.591
<i>" I would drive her</i>
<i>to the airport, man!</i>

02:22:45.926 --> 02:22:49.862
<i>" I would hold her purse while
she shopped, all over her tits!"</i>

02:22:56.804 --> 02:22:58.101
Thank you.

02:22:59.106 --> 02:23:02.598
Hi, I need a pound of turkey and a
half-pint of macaroni salad, please.

02:23:04.845 --> 02:23:06.938
Um...
Yeah, I'll just be one sec, okay?

02:23:07.047 --> 02:23:08.480
Okay, thanks.

02:23:09.483 --> 02:23:11.280
The last time I came here,

02:23:11.385 --> 02:23:14.980
the roast beef you gave me
had the string still around it

02:23:15.089 --> 02:23:19.788
and I was unaware of this and fed
it to my husband, and he choked.

02:23:23.364 --> 02:23:24.956
How's it going, George?

02:23:26.333 --> 02:23:29.825
You get a break or anything
where you can talk?

02:23:29.937 --> 02:23:33.532
Okay, yeah. Sure.
Chuck, I'll be one sec, okay, man?

02:23:35.409 --> 02:23:36.774
Shit.

02:23:49.123 --> 02:23:51.614
So, you had to get
your job back here, huh?

02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:57.321
Yeah. You know, I figured I
could use a little job stability.

02:23:57.865 --> 02:23:59.628
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:03.233
I get health insurance.
It's pretty good.

02:24:03.904 --> 02:24:10.173
So, I thought a lot about
what you said in the car to me.

02:24:11.145 --> 02:24:14.842
A few of those things
might have been accurate.

02:24:15.749 --> 02:24:19.583
You tried to help me and I'm sorry I
put you in the middle of all that stuff.

02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:22.984
I'm better in my body.

02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:26.821
My brain has a ways to go, though.

02:24:29.029 --> 02:24:31.623
How are you doing, though?
You're doing okay?

02:24:35.502 --> 02:24:36.969
I don't know, Ira.

02:24:41.508 --> 02:24:42.475
I...

02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:46.477
I caught your whole set
the other night, Ira. Nice.

02:24:47.147 --> 02:24:48.808
Yeah, yeah, no,
you're getting a rhythm.

02:24:48.916 --> 02:24:53.012
You're starting to be the Ira
I like in real life onstage.

02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:55.816
Thanks. Yeah, I've been getting up
a lot lately, so it's going well.

02:24:55.923 --> 02:24:59.017
Yeah, you were funny,
and it was a fart-free set.

02:24:59.393 --> 02:25:03.295
I wrote some stuff down that
night that... Some jokes.

02:25:03.397 --> 02:25:05.160
You want to hear it?

02:25:05.265 --> 02:25:06.960
You what?

02:25:07.067 --> 02:25:10.332
I couldn't stop thinking of jokes
for you last night. It was bizarre.

02:25:11.038 --> 02:25:14.030
I'm not saying they're
good jokes, but I try.

02:25:16.043 --> 02:25:17.442
You actually wrote them down!

02:25:17.544 --> 02:25:20.138
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My fucking memory's horrible.

02:25:20.848 --> 02:25:24.784
That thing you did about the
Wii Fit thing. What's that?

02:25:24.918 --> 02:25:26.852
Oh, like, "My video game..."
- Yeah.

02:25:26.954 --> 02:25:28.717
"My video game told me I'm fat?"

02:25:28.822 --> 02:25:30.619
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"The ultimate betrayal." Yeah.

02:25:30.724 --> 02:25:35.320
Right, right. You could maybe say, "I mean,
that's like my pot telling me I'm lazy."

02:25:35.496 --> 02:25:36.656
Oh, that's really funny.

02:25:36.764 --> 02:25:38.732
"And the Wii is similar
to my grandmother.

02:25:38.832 --> 02:25:40.629
"She used to tell me
I'm getting chubby

02:25:40.734 --> 02:25:43.760
"and then bring me chicken parmesan
and say, 'Why are you so fat?"'

02:25:45.038 --> 02:25:46.198
That's really funny!

02:25:46.306 --> 02:25:49.434
It's true. The video game made me
fat and... It is like my grandmother.

02:25:49.543 --> 02:25:50.567
All right.
"Why are you so fat?

02:25:50.677 --> 02:25:52.440
"Here's four gallons
of chocolate milk."

02:25:52.546 --> 02:25:54.013
That's good!
She would always do that.

02:25:54.114 --> 02:25:55.979
That's good.
I got one I've been afraid to tell,

02:25:56.083 --> 02:25:59.883
kind of, about, like, Viagra.
It's like, "My grandfather takes Viagra

02:25:59.987 --> 02:26:02.922
"and he thought he was
tittie-fucking my grandmother..."

02:26:03.023 --> 02:26:04.513
Yeah?
- "But then he realized he was tittie-fucking

02:26:04.625 --> 02:26:05.592
"his own balls."

02:26:07.594 --> 02:26:08.891
That's funny!
You got to do that!

02:26:08.996 --> 02:26:10.258
That's pretty funny, huh?

02:26:10.364 --> 02:26:13.026
You got to say that the thing...
That when you're that old

02:26:13.133 --> 02:26:15.567
and you have a boner that there's
not a good position, you know?

02:26:15.669 --> 02:26:16.829
That's funny!
That's really...

02:26:16.937 --> 02:26:18.461
You do it doggy-style,
your knees hurt.

02:26:18.572 --> 02:26:20.437
You get water on your knee.

02:26:20.541 --> 02:26:22.304
"I can't even hold myself up in..."
- Exactly.

02:26:22.409 --> 02:26:24.274
"What would an old man do?"
- Yeah...

02:28:36.743 --> 02:28:38.370
<i>Let's do another bad one then</i>

02:28:38.478 --> 02:28:42.073
<i>'cause I like it when the
blood drains from David's face.</i>

02:30:39.766 --> 02:30:40.733
<i>Okay.</i>

02:31:08.695 --> 02:31:15.066
<i> Burnt-out ends</i>
<i>of smoky days</i>

02:31:15.168 --> 02:31:20.936
<i>The stale cold smell</i>
<i>of morning</i>

02:31:22.476 --> 02:31:28.779
<i>The streetlamp dies,</i>
<i>another night is over</i>

02:31:29.449 --> 02:31:35.081
<i>Another day is dawning</i>

02:31:36.857 --> 02:31:42.227
<i>Touch me</i>
<i>It's so easy to leave me</i>

02:31:42.796 --> 02:31:49.292
<i>All alone with the memory</i>
<i>Of my days in the sun</i>

02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:57.007
<i>If you touch me</i>
<i>You'll understand what happiness is</i>

02:31:58.211 --> 02:32:02.671
<i>Look, a new day</i>

02:32:02.783 --> 02:32:07.482
<i>has begun</i>
