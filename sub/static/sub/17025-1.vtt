01:48.675 --> 01:50.142
[Screams]

02:37.524 --> 02:40.459
My firm's done a tremendous
amount of market research.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.152
We've discovered two things:

02:42.262 --> 02:46.756
One, most Americans feel
that Christmas is a time for family.

02:46.866 --> 02:51.098
Two, most Americans feel that in order
to stand being around their family,

02:51.204 --> 02:52.603
for even one or two days,

02:52.705 --> 02:56.732
they need to swill as much
alcohol as humanly possible.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.074
Now, I'd like you
to meet the Noggertons.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.114
They're a classic American family.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.979
They're together on Christmas,
they're fat-free,

03:05.084 --> 03:06.847
and 10 percent alcohol
by volume.

03:06.953 --> 03:11.322
Enjoy our family, so you can
enjoy your family.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.789
What do you think?

03:12.892 --> 03:17.090
So, you're suggesting we tell people
the only way to get through the holidays

03:17.197 --> 03:19.597
is to drink spiked egg nog?

03:19.699 --> 03:22.224
I'm suggesting the only way
to get through the holidays

03:22.335 --> 03:25.896
is to buy your farm-fresh, fat-free,
pre-spiked egg nog in a bottle.

03:27.974 --> 03:32.206
- Take care. All right.
- It's all good. How do you do it?

03:32.312 --> 03:34.974
I'm very excited.
I look forward to it.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.708
It went pretty well, huh?

03:36.816 --> 03:38.113
I'm a genius.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.812
I feel like I could sell
whale steaks to Greenpeace.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.251
Nice image.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.347
- Here are your tickets to Fiji.
- Ah.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.259
[Drew] Missy, we've been
dating a while.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.735
Let's take our relationship
to the next level.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.806
[Missy] I've hoped you would say that.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.535
[Drew] I got you a little
pre-Christmas Christmas gift.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.304
[Missy] Yeah?

04:05.411 --> 04:10.405
I want you to open it now
because it involves our future.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.679
The future of you and me together.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.687
It's kind of for both of us,
in that way.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.750
[Gasps]

04:20.860 --> 04:22.487
[Breathless] Okay.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.436
Tickets to Fiji?

04:31.537 --> 04:33.869
Yes. First class.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.531
Drew, on Christmas?

04:35.642 --> 04:38.338
Christmas is the family holiday.

04:38.444 --> 04:42.346
I mean, what are we doing? What is this?
I mean, what is going on?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.882
Where is this relationship headed?

04:45.918 --> 04:48.546
Fiji. First class.

04:48.655 --> 04:52.284
- Missy?
- Uh-uh. Okay.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.553
Here's an example
of one of our problems.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.495
You never introduced me to your family.
You never mentioned your family.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.963
Do you even have a family?

05:00.066 --> 05:04.526
How can you be serious about me,
if you're not serious about your family?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.197
You need to get some
serious help, Drew.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.172
I think you're missing the point.

05:09.275 --> 05:13.075
If I told you everything about me,
there'd be no more sense of mystery.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.578
Nothing left to discover.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.377
With nothing left to discover,
a relationship dies.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.781
You don't want this to die, do you?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.286
It just did.

05:24.424 --> 05:27.120
Come on. Don't be like that.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.524
You're gonna be like that?
Go ahead. Go.

05:29.629 --> 05:32.029
I'm going to spend Christmas
with my family.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.122
You can spend Christmas alone.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.329
[Drew] Missy.

05:58.591 --> 06:03.858
Kathryn, I need you to get
a Cartier bracelet to send to Missy.

06:03.963 --> 06:06.955
Something expensive,
a lot of diamonds, very flashy.

06:07.066 --> 06:10.695
- Include a personal note from me.
- What exactly do you want it to say?

06:10.803 --> 06:14.534
Something personal that shows
the depth of my feelings, my emotions.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.701
- You're good. That's why I hired you.
- Okay, but it's not gonna work.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.410
My man.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.278
Oh, Dougie!

06:29.389 --> 06:31.380
Doogan. Doog-ray.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.322
Douglas.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.326
It's Drew.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.191
Drew Latham.
[Chuckles]

06:37.296 --> 06:39.025
Yeah. What's up, man?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.930
What are you up?
Ah, nothin', nothin'.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.265
Hey, man,
what're you doing for Christmas?

06:45.371 --> 06:48.465
Family? Nice. Nice call.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.304
Uh, you got room for one more?

06:52.345 --> 06:55.576
Well, I think we are that close.

06:57.683 --> 07:01.483
I love Jewish Christ...
I'll light candles, spin the dreidel.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.114
It'll be great,
a matzo ball soup and baklava.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.887
All right, well, that's Greek.
Fine, whatever. I'm just...

07:08.995 --> 07:10.121
You still there?

07:11.631 --> 07:14.532
I know you have a baby.
I'm just saying, like, you know,

07:14.634 --> 07:17.899
they just lie there
and crap themselves, right?

07:18.004 --> 07:20.472
After a while,
how interesting is that?

07:20.573 --> 07:23.565
No, I'm not saying anything bad.
I'm just sayin'...

07:23.676 --> 07:25.405
Huh?

07:25.511 --> 07:28.275
Well, maybe, your wife
doesn't have to come, man.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.349
Maybe it's me and you
for Christmas.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.974
You ever think about that?

07:34.921 --> 07:38.857
Would you mind if I came by
to your house and spent Christmas?

07:38.958 --> 07:43.054
It's like one or two, three days, tops.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.323
[Pen scratching]

08:33.145 --> 08:35.578
[Sighs] All right.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.275
Merry Christmas.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.686
[Jet engines roaring]

08:44.924 --> 08:47.654
[Man] Okay, right over here.
Everybody stay together.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.456
All real good.
Okay, you've got Tu-Tu...

08:50.563 --> 08:53.532
[Drew] Doctor Freeman!
Thank God, I found you.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.123
[Freeman] Sir, sir...

08:55.234 --> 08:58.601
I gotta spend Christmas alone.
I'm having a panic attack.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.832
- You gotta help me. Please!
- Who are you? I don't know you.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.171
I'm the boyfriend
of one of your patients.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.904
- You are?
- Missy Vangilder.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.776
[Laughing] You're Drew.
You're Drew. Oh, God.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.372
- What does that mean?
- I'm not allowed to say.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.214
- How did you find me?
- I bribed a woman at your service.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.721
She should raise her standards
or you gotta fire her.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.518
She totally caved for 200 bucks.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.490
- Whatever.
- I need a few minutes.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.960
[Freeman] Backpacks on the belt.
Game Boy too.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.294
You gotta help me out.
I don't wanna spend Christmas alone.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.628
If you would just please!

09:28.734 --> 09:30.634
She's gotta put
the bear on the belt.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.226
Can't she walk it through?

09:32.338 --> 09:34.067
She's got to put it on the belt.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.164
- It's a puppy!
- I know it's a puppy.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.175
Put Tu-Tu on
and she'll go for a ride.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.609
- My Tu-Tu!
- I need one second.

09:40.713 --> 09:41.975
If you could just please!

09:42.081 --> 09:45.517
- Okay, gimme the puppy.
- Sir, I need you to step here.

09:45.618 --> 09:50.214
- [Drew] You're abusing your child.
- Can you see I've got my own problems?

09:50.323 --> 09:53.258
- Whoa, whoa, now.
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

09:53.359 --> 09:57.420
Okay. Okay.
Hey, I know.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.794
- Heard it on the radio once.
- All right.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.834
Write down your grievances
about your family on paper.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.596
- All your grievances.
- Right.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.502
Go someplace that reminds you
of your childhood,

10:07.607 --> 10:10.167
at sunset and light
that piece of paper on fire.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.871
As the last shred of paper
is burning away, you whisper,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.208
"I forgive you."

10:15.314 --> 10:17.282
- "I forgive you."
- Mm-hm.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.578
- And it burns up.
- That's it.

10:19.685 --> 10:20.879
I like it.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.955
- Oh, thanks so much!
- Whoa! All right.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.683
- Have a good vaca.
- Where's my daughter?

10:25.791 --> 10:26.883
- [Beeping]
- Sir?

10:26.993 --> 10:28.517
Huh? Oh, there she is.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.461
Whoa! Hey! Come on out!
Come out for Daddy!

10:44.377 --> 10:46.777
My grievances.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.989
Okay, buddy, here we go.
That'll be $ 72.50.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.792
My God!

11:06.899 --> 11:08.594
That's it!

11:08.701 --> 11:10.669
That's the house I grew up in.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.830
How's the $ 72.50 comin'?

11:13.939 --> 11:16.931
Good. It's comin' good.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.908
Keep the meter running.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.603
- [Tom] Almost out of salami.
- [Christine] No.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.331
Well, thank you for telling me.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.135
- I don't wanna run out, that's all.
- God forbid.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.175
- Did Brian eat?
- I don't know.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.711
[Shouting] Get down here
and eat your dinner.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.475
- I'm not hungry!
- [Tom] Yeah, you are!

11:56.582 --> 11:59.278
[Christine] Stop yelling at me.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.943
[Tom] I'm not yelling at you.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.212
Brian!

12:06.525 --> 12:07.992
[Shouting] Brian!

12:08.094 --> 12:12.155
Get down here please, so your father
can stop not yelling at me!

12:12.264 --> 12:14.129
I'm busy!

12:14.233 --> 12:16.463
We shouldn't have put
the computer in his room.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.469
He's gonna spend
all his time there.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.869
Oh, Tom.
Welcome to the future, dear.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.440
He's advancing his skills.

12:22.541 --> 12:25.669
One day that computer's
gonna get our baby a good job.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.769
[Beeping]

12:27.880 --> 12:30.440
[Music plays, woman's voice]

12:32.752 --> 12:35.448
Trust me. What he's doin',
nobody's gonna pay for,

12:35.554 --> 12:38.352
'cause if they did,
I'd have retired at 17.

12:42.528 --> 12:45.520
- [Tom] What?
- There's a guy out there.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.565
Who the hell is that?

12:59.178 --> 13:01.942
[Drew] All right. Alone on Christmas.
I can do this.

13:02.047 --> 13:07.508
[Sighs] I rid myself
of all my grievances.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.747
Be gone, grievances.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.687
What the...

13:16.996 --> 13:18.156
I forgive you.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.401
Holy Moly. This joker.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.266
[Tires screeching]

13:48.060 --> 13:50.722
What are the neighbors gonna think?

13:50.830 --> 13:54.391
Unless they want to get hit, they
shouldn't be burning crap in my yard.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.195
Is he still breathing?

13:58.204 --> 14:00.468
Dear God, Tom.
You've killed the man.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.598
Oh, shit! He's still alive!

14:02.708 --> 14:05.677
[Groaning] Hello.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.272
[Whimpers]

14:10.883 --> 14:14.250
My name is Drew Latham.
[Chuckles]

14:15.621 --> 14:18.089
I grew up in this house.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.318
That's why you came back and
tried to burn it down, Pyroboy?

14:21.427 --> 14:23.486
- Brian, call the cops.
- Oh, no, no, no!

14:23.596 --> 14:27.191
That won't be necessary. That's fine.
I was just outside burning,

14:27.299 --> 14:29.824
someone told me to burn
a list of my grievances

14:29.935 --> 14:33.393
outside of the home of my birth
to help me with loneliness issues.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.871
- So, it's all fine.
- Oh.

14:35.975 --> 14:39.934
Any-hoo, apologies
and I'm gonna go.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.378
Would you mind terribly
if I took a look-see around the house?

14:43.482 --> 14:45.882
- I'll give you a tour.
- [Drew] Oh, thank you.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.385
Hold on.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.149
- You got any more matches?
- No. No, no, no.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.656
Are we done with all that?

14:52.758 --> 14:54.123
Yes. The burning. Yes.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.786
It's completely done.
I'm actually better.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.261
I'm watching you.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.666
Wow. I can't believe it!

15:04.770 --> 15:07.398
This is amazing!
It's exactly how I remember it.

15:07.506 --> 15:11.875
- You mean it was always a shithole?
- No. No, it's great.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.511
[Squeak]

15:19.618 --> 15:22.485
- Did you hear that?
- [Squeaking]

15:22.588 --> 15:24.886
That stair squeaked.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.652
Do you know what we
used to call that squeaky stair?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.820
"The squeaky stair."
[Laughing]

15:30.930 --> 15:34.127
- [Squeaking]
- [Laughing]

15:42.541 --> 15:46.272
Wow. My old room.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.777
My God.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.077
Hey, look at that!
I can touch the ceiling.

15:51.183 --> 15:54.550
It's much smaller than I remember it.
Did you do something?

15:54.653 --> 15:57.349
Yeah. We had it reduced.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.914
Cost a lot, but yeah,
I think it was...

16:01.026 --> 16:02.459
I think it was worth it.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.756
Man, this is great.
Man, this is the best.

16:04.863 --> 16:08.299
You guys sittin' around
eatin' dinner like a family.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.335
I always wanted that.
This is really wonderful.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.233
[Brian] Wonderful.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.467
So, what's for dessert?

16:16.575 --> 16:19.203
- Kitchen's closed.
- Aw.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.302
- Yeah, I got things to do.
- Ah, boy.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.779
Tom, why don't you
see the man out?

16:23.882 --> 16:26.476
I didn't want to let him in.
I'll call you a cab.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.519
Is that necessary?

16:28.620 --> 16:29.882
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.514
But you know, man,
I gotta tell ya,

16:32.624 --> 16:35.149
all these years I've been
avoiding Christmas,

16:35.260 --> 16:39.458
and I just realized,
this is what I've been longing for.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.830
A real family, you know?
In a true home.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.563
That's why I'm thinking

16:45.671 --> 16:48.572
it might be a good idea
if I lived with you.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.801
- [Drew grunts]
- [Door slams]

17:22.974 --> 17:25.671
[Drew knocking] Tom! Tom!

17:27.079 --> 17:29.445
Tom, please!
Please let me stay here!

17:29.548 --> 17:30.515
No.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.517
- I'll pay you.
- My family's not for sale, pal.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.315
Tom, I'll pay you $250,000.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.615
Welcome home, son.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.193
[Splashing]

17:42.294 --> 17:43.818
Mom.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.531
Tom, that guy is still here.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.401
- Yeah, I know.
- Why is he still here?

17:56.208 --> 17:59.803
He's givin' us $250,000
to be his family for Christmas.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.143
And you agreed to this?
Without asking me?

18:03.248 --> 18:06.877
Of course I did.
He's giving us $250,000.

18:06.985 --> 18:10.045
How would you like it if I
agreed to this without asking you?

18:10.155 --> 18:13.124
Well, that would depend.
Would we be getting $250,000?

18:16.361 --> 18:18.955
Okay. What exactly
did you agree to?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.262
[Sighs]

18:30.342 --> 18:32.207
It's a big day for this family.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.142
- Very well.
- All right.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.114
Mr. Latham agrees
to pay the sum of $250,000

18:38.217 --> 18:43.746
to the Valcos for services rendered
until 11:59 pm on Christmas Day.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.620
And for said sum, the Valco family

18:46.725 --> 18:50.024
will aid Mr. Latham in recapturing

18:50.129 --> 18:53.189
those childhood Christmas memories,

18:53.298 --> 18:55.960
- including, but not limited to,
- [sighs]

18:56.068 --> 19:00.664
All due festiveness, celebrations,
various and sundry merriments,

19:00.772 --> 19:02.865
and yuletide glee.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.034
Agreed!

19:05.144 --> 19:07.044
Agreed, right?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.376
Fakin' it anyway.
Might as well get paid.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.244
Will there be anything else?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.545
Oh, yeah. I gotta sleep
in Brian's room.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.644
What? No.
Where is this going here?

19:16.755 --> 19:19.952
Like it says in the contract.
I get to sleep in my old room.

19:20.058 --> 19:23.960
Oh, come on. Creepy grievance guy
wants to sleep in my room?

19:24.062 --> 19:27.930
If I wanted that, I'd use a bus ticket
those guys send me on the Internet.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.968
I just wanna sleep in my room,
like it says in the contract.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.162
Brian, you're in the guest room.

19:33.272 --> 19:37.333
My computer's not in the guest room.
How am I supposed to... study?

19:37.442 --> 19:39.307
Use your imagination.

19:39.411 --> 19:42.107
Well, I'm gonna
catch some shut-eye.

19:42.214 --> 19:46.275
Who wants to go Christmas tree
shopping with me in the morning?

19:49.121 --> 19:51.646
Apparently, you all do.

19:51.757 --> 19:51.857
[Birds chirping]

19:51.857 --> 19:54.018
[Birds chirping]

19:57.896 --> 19:59.761
[Yawns]

20:12.244 --> 20:14.041
I'm home.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.056
Oh!

20:30.128 --> 20:32.153
[Christine] Brian? Brian!

20:32.264 --> 20:34.095
[Brian] I didn't do it.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.393
[Drew] It's all right.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.334
[Chuckling] I'll fix it.
I'll fix it. Ow.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.079
[Tom] Well, that should do it,
assuming no other idiot...

20:55.787 --> 20:57.152
Is he eatin' my salami?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.383
That's what it looks like.

21:01.293 --> 21:05.627
- It's 9:00 in the mornin'.
- Oh, I know. It's not breakfast food,

21:05.731 --> 21:08.063
but it was lookin' good.
I had to dog some.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.726
Yeah, it is good.

21:10.836 --> 21:13.964
- Is that the last of it?
- Yep.

21:26.051 --> 21:29.043
Oh. You didn't want some, did ya?

21:29.154 --> 21:31.816
No. It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.413
Ah.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.394
[Drew] Kathryn, I hope
you're checking messages.

21:38.497 --> 21:41.159
Should anyone need to reach me,
they can call my cell.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.790
If you need to send anything,

21:42.901 --> 21:47.463
the address is 2 Edgewood Road
in Lincoln Wood, Illinois.

21:47.572 --> 21:49.506
Stayin' with my family.

21:50.776 --> 21:51.902
Hey, Dad?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.145
He's talkin' to you, genius.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.517
Yeah, Drew?

22:02.120 --> 22:06.113
Would you do me a kindness?
Put this hat on.

22:06.224 --> 22:09.455
My dad used to wear a Santa hat
when we went Christmas tree shopping.

22:09.561 --> 22:10.585
[Laughter]

22:10.696 --> 22:12.493
- In public?
- Yeah.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.121
That would be no.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.463
And in private,
that would be no, too.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.196
Please wear the hat.

22:20.372 --> 22:22.567
No. I'm not wearing the hat.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.801
Tom, you gotta wear the hat.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.310
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- Wear the hat, Tom.

22:27.412 --> 22:30.176
Now get it away from me
before I shove it up your ass.

22:32.651 --> 22:36.212
Tom, are you familiar
with the phrase "breach of contract?"

22:40.926 --> 22:44.362
- Give me the hat.
- All right.

22:44.463 --> 22:48.797
$250,000. $250,000.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.028
- $250,000.
- [Brian chuckling]

22:52.137 --> 22:53.570
You're lookin' good, Dad.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.435
- [Christine] Tom!
- Shut up!

22:55.540 --> 22:57.371
Eyes on the road.
On the road. Dad.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.034
- Gimme your leg.
- [Screeching]

22:59.211 --> 23:01.076
[Drew] No.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.680
Nope.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.480
Oh, wait a minute.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.487
This could be it.
This could be it.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.887
Yep. This is it.
This is the one.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.221
[Drew] You're good.
Excuse me, folks.

23:16.228 --> 23:21.131
Dad, you wanna lift that up,
have respect for the tree? No?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.861
It's gonna be in our house, so...

23:23.969 --> 23:26.665
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are we going with this?

23:28.173 --> 23:31.233
All right. Let's get that baby up there,
hoist that up.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.777
- Get that on the roof.
- [Tom grunts]

23:33.879 --> 23:35.608
All righty.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.616
[Drew] That's pretty good. All right!
You got it. There you go.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.277
[Drew] That's pretty good. All right!
You got it. There you go.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.249
Get around it.
Get around on it.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.547
[Tom straining]

23:42.654 --> 23:46.055
Brian, get your skinny little ass
out of the car!

23:46.158 --> 23:47.921
[Drew] You got it, Dad.
You got it.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.550
You got it.

23:49.661 --> 23:53.324
Nice one. All right, I think it's good.
I think it's good like that.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.401
Whoo! Christmas time.

24:01.473 --> 24:04.909
- [Drew] How's it look?
- [Brian] It could trigger a seizure.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.535
I know.
Wait till you see it lit up.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.943
I thought it was lit up.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.173
Oh no, no, no.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.809
<i>We gotta sing Christmas Tree first.
Tom, you take the lead.</i>

24:14.653 --> 24:17.451
- You want me to sing?
- Yeah.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.616
Do I have to?

24:20.725 --> 24:22.022
Yeah.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.286
Would it make any difference
if I didn't want to?

24:25.397 --> 24:26.489
Not really.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.731
Come on.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.796
<i>Oh, Christmas tree</i>

24:34.906 --> 24:37.374
Christine, you wanna
help me out here a little?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.444
No, you're doin' great.

24:39.544 --> 24:43.503
You're doin' good, Dad.
Come on. You can do it.

24:46.918 --> 24:50.718
<i>[Both] Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

24:50.822 --> 24:54.258
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

24:54.359 --> 24:56.156
<i>You are as green</i>

24:56.261 --> 24:58.092
<i>- As winter snow
- As summer snow</i>

24:58.196 --> 25:00.460
<i>- Winter snow.
- Winter snow</i>

25:00.565 --> 25:04.092
<i>As in summer's brightest glow</i>

25:04.202 --> 25:09.435
<i>Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

25:09.541 --> 25:14.706
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

25:14.813 --> 25:16.508
<i>Ahhh</i>

25:16.615 --> 25:17.843
That was great.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.440
- [Drew] That was good.
- [Tom] That was, yeah.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.519
All right.

25:21.620 --> 25:26.421
Without further ado, let's fire it up.
Ready? One, two...

25:26.525 --> 25:28.755
- [knocking]
- [Groans]

25:28.860 --> 25:31.260
All right, people.
Take five. I'll deal with this.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.194
Thank Christ.

25:34.799 --> 25:36.164
Can I help you?

25:38.303 --> 25:40.794
Yeah. Who are you?

25:40.906 --> 25:42.533
Um, who are you?

25:42.641 --> 25:44.336
[Christine] Alicia!

25:44.442 --> 25:46.672
Hey, Mom. Hi. Who's this?

25:46.778 --> 25:48.973
Mom, who is this?

25:49.080 --> 25:50.775
Okay, what's going on?

25:50.882 --> 25:54.147
Dad's rented us for the holidays
to this eccentric millionaire.

25:54.252 --> 25:57.619
[Drew] You have a daughter?
Since when do you have a daughter?

25:57.722 --> 26:00.987
- It's her terrible secret.
- This is gonna ruin everything.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.560
- The whole bit doesn't work.
- Ruin? Know what?

26:03.662 --> 26:07.530
Shh. Will somebody say something
that makes some sense right now?

26:07.632 --> 26:09.896
Well, around Christmas,
I get anxiety...

26:10.001 --> 26:12.333
No, no. You stop talking. Mom?

26:12.437 --> 26:15.634
Drew wants a family Christmas,
so we're gonna be his family.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.503
- That's insane.
- Tell me about it.

26:17.609 --> 26:20.339
I never had a sister,
so this is bullshit right here.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.970
Okay. You are my
illegitimate love child.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.447
- Mom!
- And you had no idea about her.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.450
That could be good.
You know what?

26:27.552 --> 26:29.850
- She could be the maid!
- Okay. Enough.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.684
Hey, my baby's home.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.621
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you, Lissi?

26:33.725 --> 26:36.990
Hi. I'm good.
You've obviously lost your mind.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.620
Can I talk to you
in the dining room, please?

26:39.731 --> 26:40.857
You knew about this?

26:40.966 --> 26:43.457
- Stay away from my daughter.
- Okay, Mom?

26:43.568 --> 26:45.593
- This guy is obviously crazy.
- I know.

26:45.704 --> 26:48.002
So, I'm gonna go upstairs,
and take a bath,

26:48.106 --> 26:51.371
and when I wake up in the morning,
he's gonna be gone, right?

26:51.476 --> 26:52.704
Maybe.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.439
I'm not gonna be a good sport
about this, Mom.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.015
Oh, darling, we'd never
expect you to be.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.109
Thanks.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.779
[Drew] Come on, Mom!
It's tree time!

27:08.560 --> 27:09.754
[Drew] Okey-dokey.

27:09.861 --> 27:12.227
All right.
We're back on track.

27:16.401 --> 27:17.663
Yeah.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.964
Okay.

27:21.072 --> 27:25.236
Here we go.
One, two, three!

27:27.812 --> 27:30.303
[Drew] Now it feels like Christmas.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.883
[Brian] I can smell
my eyeballs burning.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.976
[Drew] Very important.
Don't look directly at the tree.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.712
[Dog barking]

27:45.930 --> 27:47.261
- Brian!
- What?

27:47.365 --> 27:49.299
Wake up!
It's your brother, kind of!

27:49.401 --> 27:51.699
It's snowing outside!
It's a snow day!

27:53.071 --> 27:54.504
Why are you waking me up?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.972
I don't want you
to miss the fun, man!

27:58.410 --> 28:00.002
What fun?

28:00.111 --> 28:04.309
[Drew] Oh! Facial! Iceball!
Whoo! Ha ha!

28:04.416 --> 28:06.441
Look out! Oh!

28:06.551 --> 28:08.212
Right in the nuts!
In the nuts!

28:08.319 --> 28:10.287
- I can't feel my toes.
- Here he comes.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.482
The look of vengeance.
Eye of the tiger.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.456
Oh, oh.
Now he's getting furious.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.391
Whoo! Whoo!

28:18.530 --> 28:20.930
- Whoo!
- [Door closing]

28:23.601 --> 28:26.661
- What's up, Tom?
- Brian, go inside.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.504
See you later, Bri.
It was fun.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.473
You like throwing snowballs?

28:32.577 --> 28:34.841
I was just havin' a good time.
You know.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.141
Yeah. Throw one at me.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.512
That's cool.
Don't worry about it.

28:39.617 --> 28:41.141
We're kinda finished now.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.379
Come on.
Like you said, it'll be fun.

28:43.488 --> 28:46.286
It's getting a little chilly.
I don't wanna bother.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.224
- Don't worry about it.
- Ah, come on. Throw it.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.992
All right, I'll throw one,
I'll throw one.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.402
Good one.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.439
Now it's my turn.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.709
No!

29:11.883 --> 29:13.475
That was great.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.746
Any time you wanna do that,
let me know.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.754
We said no iceballs, man.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.619
Oh, did we?

29:20.859 --> 29:22.292
Morning, Mom.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.020
Freak.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.856
You know what?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.228
We may have gotten off
on the wrong track.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.633
We should start over.

29:32.737 --> 29:34.568
- Here you go, Drew.
- Thanks, Mom.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.572
- Mmm.
- Problem?

29:36.674 --> 29:40.201
My real mom puts marshmallows
in the hot chocolate.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.405
Know what I was thinking?
If you don't wanna play my sister,

29:43.515 --> 29:46.507
maybe you could be, like,
a wonderful, mysterious

29:46.618 --> 29:49.416
Ecuadorean cleaning lady.
You know?

29:49.521 --> 29:52.388
Or Swedish cleaning lady.
The ethnicity's not important.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.084
But cleaning lady's good.
Oh. Mmm.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.660
What?

29:56.761 --> 29:59.821
My real mom used the
mini-marshmallows. Sorry.

29:59.931 --> 30:04.527
Speaking of your mom, why aren't you
annoying your own family?

30:04.636 --> 30:07.605
That's not really your business,
is it, Consuela?

30:14.412 --> 30:16.573
[Drew] Ho, ho, ho!

30:16.681 --> 30:19.912
All righty.
Welcome, everyone.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.382
- Here you are.
- What is this?

30:23.488 --> 30:26.980
These are what we
in the business call scripts, Tom.

30:27.091 --> 30:29.821
- Excuse me?
- You don't have to worry about it.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.953
Your role is what we call "small."

30:32.063 --> 30:35.692
Well, you're what we
in real life call "a jackass."

30:35.800 --> 30:38.769
I don't know about that,
but I do know that my being here

30:38.870 --> 30:41.839
may have caused some awkwardness
within the family.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.408
- You think?
- [Drew] I do, Tom. Seriously.

30:44.509 --> 30:48.104
And it's even possible
that some of it could potentially be

30:48.213 --> 30:50.443
in some small way
partly my fault.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.914
Which part wasn't your fault?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.451
Bop, bop, bop, bop.
I'm talking. Okay?

30:55.553 --> 30:58.818
So what I've done is I went
ahead and wrote a sequence,

30:58.923 --> 31:02.051
so you guys can get a sense
of what I'm going for here.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.062
And we're all gonna
read this aloud.

31:04.062 --> 31:04.721
And we're all gonna
read this aloud.

31:04.829 --> 31:08.128
- I feel like I'm insane.
- That's why you have no lines.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.861
- Mom, I believe you go first.
- Okay.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.834
"Oh, look at us.

31:12.937 --> 31:16.771
I sure hope you like the meal
I so lovingly prepared

31:16.875 --> 31:18.809
for the people I love.

31:18.910 --> 31:22.209
She smiles at Tom."
Oh, she's...

31:23.081 --> 31:25.845
[Drew] Have you acted?
You've acted before.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.713
- A little theater.
- I can tell.

31:27.819 --> 31:31.277
<i>- I see it. It comes out.
- You were in Pippin in high school.</i>

31:31.389 --> 31:33.880
You played Wind.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.324
Tom, you have the next line.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.122
Uh...

31:38.229 --> 31:41.630
"Say thank you to your mother
for all her hard work cooking for us."

31:41.733 --> 31:44.065
"Thank you."

31:44.168 --> 31:46.636
"Oh, I don't work nearly
as hard as you, dear."

31:46.738 --> 31:48.000
Well, that's true.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.132
Tom, let's stay on book, please.
Brian, go ahead.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.905
"Gee, Mom, I love you
like the dickens.

31:55.013 --> 31:56.981
Should we pray?"

31:57.081 --> 32:00.448
Gee, Beav, do you think Wally's
gonna give you the business?

32:00.551 --> 32:03.019
Oh, there you are, Consuela.

32:03.121 --> 32:06.750
<i>Five waters for everyone, please.
Gracias.</i>

32:06.858 --> 32:09.952
[Clears throat] Brian,
you were about to say grace.

32:11.663 --> 32:15.497
- "Dear God..."
- Brian. We hold hands at grace.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.527
[Brian] "Dear God,

32:20.638 --> 32:22.003
thank you for this meal.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.131
Thank you for blessing us
with a family.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.869
Not everyone has a nice family.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.638
And also we, O Lord,

32:27.745 --> 32:31.078
are so lucky to have Drew
in our lives."

32:31.182 --> 32:32.877
Amen.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.515
"An emotional moment."

32:36.621 --> 32:38.486
Sorry, I keep doing that.

32:38.589 --> 32:42.081
"Brian, if you eat it all up,
I will let you sleep with me

32:42.193 --> 32:45.321
like I never did
when you were little."

32:47.665 --> 32:49.963
An awkward moment.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.968
Skip ahead.
That doesn't work.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.971
- That's not supposed to be there.
- What does this mean?

32:55.073 --> 32:57.064
"Doo-Dah enters
in his bathrobe."

32:57.175 --> 33:01.111
Sweet Jim Jiminy!
Cold corn in the mornin'!

33:01.212 --> 33:05.706
- This weather is killin' my joints.
- Brian, go get the shovel.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.617
[Drew] Listen to me. When Alicia came,
she totally ruined everything.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.155
Everything was so normal
up until that point.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.587
<i>Silencio, por favor.</i>

33:13.691 --> 33:16.956
So I realized what I had to do
was expand the family.

33:17.061 --> 33:19.825
I had to find my grandpa.
So I went and found my Doo-Dah.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.092
Here he is. My Doo-Dah.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.863
<i>Your Doo-Dah looks exactly like the guy
in Christmas Carol. Scrooge.</i>

33:25.970 --> 33:28.234
That's right.
I do community theater.

33:28.339 --> 33:31.331
And this Christmas night,
I'm reprising my role as Scrooge

33:31.442 --> 33:34.036
in the Lincoln Wood
Theater Group's production

33:34.145 --> 33:36.875
<i>of A Christmas Carol.
I hope you all can make it.</i>

33:36.981 --> 33:39.506
Please stay in character, Saul, okay?

33:39.617 --> 33:41.380
"I'm so glad that you came here.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.182
You're gonna stay for
the whole Christmas holiday."

33:44.288 --> 33:47.348
Whoa, no, he's not.
I agreed to let you in the house,

33:47.458 --> 33:50.256
- not Doo-Doo over here.
- Doo-Dah.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.693
- Nobody's talkin' to you.
- [Groans] Look.

33:52.797 --> 33:54.560
I'll give you $25,000.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.426
How you doin', Doo-Dah?

33:58.536 --> 34:00.265
You can stay in the living room.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.669
No, Dad, I'm sleeping
in the living room.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.173
Not anymore.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.835
Where am I gonna sleep?

34:06.944 --> 34:08.935
[Dog barking]

34:11.815 --> 34:14.045
Ow.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.983
I hate these people.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.755
<i>[The Waitresses:
Christmas Wrapping]</i>

34:17.755 --> 34:18.652
<i>[The Waitresses:
Christmas Wrapping]</i>

34:30.635 --> 34:33.502
Everybody get some presents,
get your shoppin' done,

34:33.603 --> 34:37.335
and then we'll meet at 4:00
at Santa's Village to take pictures.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.306
Kids, don't lose track of time.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.639
Mom, you wanna stick
with Doo-Dah?

34:41.746 --> 34:45.079
- Why me?
- He's your father.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.208
- [Doo-Dah] How come you never call?
- Tom! Tom! Tom!

34:48.319 --> 34:49.911
Yes, Drew?

34:50.021 --> 34:52.819
Aren't you forgettin' something, T-Bone?

34:54.292 --> 34:57.489
Here you go, Lenny.
Happy holidays to you.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.392
- [Lenny] You too.
- Hey, Tommy!

34:59.497 --> 35:01.488
[Laughing] Nice hat.

35:01.599 --> 35:05.365
- How's the holidays?
- Considering I got a pain in my ass

35:05.470 --> 35:07.495
about six feet tall
in my house, all right.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.095
Oh, relatives, huh?

35:09.207 --> 35:11.198
- Kinda.
- Oh, your wife's family.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.506
They hang around your house
all day and drink your beer.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.438
They eat your salami.

35:18.483 --> 35:22.078
- Hey, guys! Wait up!
- [Alicia sighs]

35:22.186 --> 35:23.653
- [Screeching]
- [Honking]

35:23.754 --> 35:26.348
[Man] Asshole!

35:26.457 --> 35:28.823
<i>[Santa Claus is Comin' to Town]</i>

35:46.210 --> 35:48.440
[Drew] All right, there we go.

35:48.546 --> 35:49.945
Excuse me.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.182
All of you?

35:59.090 --> 36:00.284
Mom, this sucks.

36:00.391 --> 36:02.416
Tell your father.
He made the deal.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.461
Everybody say "Merry Christmas."

36:04.562 --> 36:07.998
- [All] Merry Christmas!
- [Santa and Drew] Ho, ho, ho!

36:11.502 --> 36:13.993
Doo-Dah, interest you
in a Christmas cookie?

36:14.105 --> 36:15.595
I can't. I'm diabetic.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.731
That dog won't hunt, my friend.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.367
Doo-Dah wasn't diabetic.
Go ahead and take one.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.309
Look, kid, I get that.

36:22.413 --> 36:25.211
But if I eat this thing,
I can't act not dead.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.874
- [Tires screeching]
- Hey!

36:26.984 --> 36:28.975
Slow down.
The roads are icy.

36:29.086 --> 36:32.817
- I don't want you to kill your family!
- [Drew] Perfect, Christine.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.358
That's what my mom
would've said. Good improv.

36:35.459 --> 36:38.758
Before your father
threw her out of the car.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.387
[Door squeaks]

36:40.498 --> 36:43.296
Ah, the old carriage house.
Brings back memories.

36:43.401 --> 36:45.335
- What's going on?
- Brian, go inside.

36:45.436 --> 36:47.836
What? Come on! Dad.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.533
I'm in my pajamas.
You want me to sleep outside?

36:50.641 --> 36:51.972
Go.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.811
Fine.

36:55.813 --> 37:00.079
I can't go in my room, I get...
You know, when I become a serial killer

37:00.184 --> 37:01.378
don't act surprised.

37:01.485 --> 37:03.453
Think positive, Bris-eye.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.546
Use your positive mindset.
That's not what we talked about.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.557
It's hard to get through to him.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.456
So what's goin' on?
What's up?

37:10.561 --> 37:12.256
You gotta go.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.695
- What?
- We can't do this no more.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.762
What do you mean?
What can't we do?

37:17.868 --> 37:21.827
Christine and I,
we're thinkin' about breakin' up.

37:23.207 --> 37:26.973
What? Why?
Is it my fault? Something I did?

37:27.078 --> 37:30.070
Is it the hat? Forget it.
Wear whatever you want, Tom.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.274
It's not you.
It's nothin' to do with you.

37:32.383 --> 37:36.683
It's been goin' on for a long time.
We're just... It's not workin' out.

37:36.787 --> 37:40.689
We were gonna wait till after
the holidays to tell the kids,

37:40.791 --> 37:42.486
and you know, with you here,

37:42.593 --> 37:46.256
and with your Christmas cheer crap,
it's making it worse.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.731
Tom, first of all,
I wanna reward you for opening up

37:49.834 --> 37:52.496
with a big "thank you,"
that deserves some credit.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.367
Second, let me tell you
what you need to do.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.407
If I was you
and comin' into some money,

37:57.508 --> 38:01.376
I'd do somethin' big, somethin'
you always wanted your whole life.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.413
Somethin' that makes you happy.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.678
I want the money. I really do.
It's Christine, she keeps...

38:07.785 --> 38:10.276
All right. Let me worry
about Christine, okay?

38:10.388 --> 38:12.117
I'll worry about Christine.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.249
You worry about Tom,
'cause it's Tom time.

38:15.359 --> 38:19.056
- [Knocking] Christine?
- Yes, dear?

38:19.163 --> 38:22.155
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course, dear. I'm your mother.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.166
You can talk to me
about anything.

38:24.268 --> 38:25.462
Great.

38:25.569 --> 38:28.902
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

38:29.006 --> 38:32.442
You sure? 'Cause you just put
a bra in Brian's sock drawer.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.170
Oh, well, that's your brother.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.338
15. Likes to experiment.
We still love him.

38:38.783 --> 38:43.686
Look, Christine, I know what's going on
with you and Tom,

38:43.788 --> 38:46.518
and first of all,
I just wanna say that

38:46.624 --> 38:49.787
I'm feeling a little ripped off here,
you know?

38:49.894 --> 38:52.727
I thought I was getting a real family.
This is bullshit.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.799
Well, it's time you grew up
and faced facts, isn't it?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.926
Mommies and daddies
fall in love, make babies,

38:59.036 --> 39:02.494
pay bills, get mad,
and stop touching each other!

39:05.943 --> 39:08.207
Second of all,

39:08.312 --> 39:11.873
I was thinkin' I could do something
to help you, make you feel better.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.950
How about just me and you
go shopping?

39:14.051 --> 39:17.282
- For what?
- I don't know. Just go shopping.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.856
You know what I mean?
It's fun just to buy shit.

39:19.957 --> 39:24.223
Listen, I know all the best
makeup and hair people.

39:24.328 --> 39:27.297
The best fashion photographer
in Chicago owes me huge!

39:27.398 --> 39:28.865
So?

39:28.966 --> 39:31.366
You don't see it, do you?

39:31.469 --> 39:35.030
You don't see what
a beautiful woman you are.

39:35.139 --> 39:39.633
You have grace and kindness
and sensuality,

39:39.744 --> 39:41.905
and this incredibly striking,

39:42.012 --> 39:45.209
kind of offbeat beauty that's...

39:45.316 --> 39:48.410
You look in the mirror, and don't
see it. We're gonna show you.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.953
How would you like me
to arrange your very own,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.819
very hip, very sexy, yet tasteful,

39:53.924 --> 39:56.757
very elegant, very modern,
very expensive

39:56.861 --> 39:59.227
photo shoot, just for you?

40:02.166 --> 40:03.394
[Sobbing]

40:03.501 --> 40:05.969
Or not.
I mean, whatever...

40:06.070 --> 40:11.064
Oh, Drew, you've made
your mama so happy.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.938
[Chuckles] Great.

40:14.678 --> 40:18.774
- Oh, Mom.
- [Christine chuckles]

40:25.055 --> 40:27.489
[Drew] Hey, Alicia.
Want to go tobogganing?

40:28.926 --> 40:32.054
Oh, I'm sorry, Drew.
Have I been sending you mixed signals?

40:32.163 --> 40:35.462
[Chuckles] I just thought
maybe instead of sitting around

40:35.566 --> 40:38.535
bickering and hating me,
you might like to have some fun.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.570
No, thanks.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.662
[Drew] Ah, I see.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.832
I get it.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.911
You're afraid of fun.
You don't like having fun.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.810
What the hell does that even mean,
"I don't like fun"?

40:50.915 --> 40:52.405
Of course I like fun.

40:52.516 --> 40:55.212
Everybody likes fun. It's fun.

40:55.319 --> 40:58.049
All right, so then why
won't you go with me?

40:58.155 --> 41:00.248
Because it would be with you.

41:00.357 --> 41:03.155
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid.

41:03.260 --> 41:06.058
I think you're afraid
that you will go, and have fun,

41:06.163 --> 41:08.723
and you might enjoy yourself,
and you'd be with me.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.393
What would that say about you?
That's what I think.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.766
- Really?
- [Drew] Mm-hm.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.536
Let's go.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.544
- [Alicia] All right.
- [Drew] Ready, Freddie.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.943
- Well, hello there, youngsters.
- Hi.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.777
- Tobogganing?
- Breakneck Hill.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.214
- Fun.
- [Drew] Yeah.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.785
Oh, what do you know?

41:28.886 --> 41:32.219
Back in my day, we couldn't
afford fancy toboggans.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.416
Are you smoking pot?

41:34.525 --> 41:35.492

[Rock music playing]

41:43.267 --> 41:44.564
What do you think?

41:44.668 --> 41:46.135
Nice.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.671
Yeah. This'll keep you
from dying, Dad.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.637
Had one of these
when I was single.

41:50.741 --> 41:52.436
I bet.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.943
Know what happened to me
on the way over here?

41:55.045 --> 41:57.036
- What?
- Got propositioned by a hooker.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.138
- Did you?
- The blonde with the big cans?

41:59.250 --> 42:02.014
Hey, watch your language
around my daughter.

42:02.119 --> 42:05.247
Brian, take a look at your father's
new automobile here!

42:05.356 --> 42:07.415
Yeah, what do you think?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.288
It's old.

42:09.393 --> 42:11.327
[Alicia] All right.
Hey, Bri, come on.

42:11.428 --> 42:15.057
- We're gonna go tobogganing.
- That's great.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.104
She's ready.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.501
Hi. I'm Christine.

42:27.144 --> 42:29.442
I feel so pretty.

42:36.687 --> 42:39.588
- What are you doing?
- Modeling.

42:41.091 --> 42:42.558
[Heinrich] Here.

42:44.795 --> 42:49.357
Chad, have you ever
seen me so elated?

42:49.466 --> 42:52.629
It must be this woman. Yes.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.536
Isn't she sexy? Erotic.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.540
- Speak!
- Absolutely, Heinrich.

42:58.642 --> 43:01.839
- She's got that special quality...
- Get out now.

43:01.946 --> 43:05.438
- But I'm agreeing with you.
- You hesitated.

43:05.549 --> 43:08.677
Yeah, you heard him.
Get out! Beat it!

43:08.786 --> 43:11.311
Get out! Beat it!

43:11.422 --> 43:15.256
[Chuckling] Uh-oh.
He thinks we're serious.

43:15.359 --> 43:18.089
We were serious.

43:18.195 --> 43:20.561
Very serious.

43:35.646 --> 43:36.977
Oh, more!

43:37.081 --> 43:39.447
Lick the lollipop! Yeah!

43:39.617 --> 43:41.482
[Brian] I do not want to do this.

43:41.585 --> 43:43.450
Ah, you say that now.

43:43.554 --> 43:48.048
Once you get going, you'll run and jump
and squeal with joy.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.557
- [Drew] Okay?
- [Alicia] Let's do this.

43:50.661 --> 43:52.288
[Drew] Here we go.
Hunker down.

Breakneck Hill!

43:59.536 --> 44:02.437
Whoo! Whoo!

44:02.539 --> 44:05.440
That was crazy!
Did you see him fly down the hill?

44:06.377 --> 44:08.937
I made a mistake.
It was scarier when I was younger.

44:09.046 --> 44:11.276
- Can we go home now?
- No, we can't go home!

44:11.382 --> 44:14.874
We are gonna risk permanent paralysis
or die trying!

44:20.858 --> 44:23.884
That one! Land!

44:26.664 --> 44:30.964
[Drew] Yes, sir! Whoo!
Gonna be some serious fun!

44:31.068 --> 44:34.196
[Brian] Sure, in a Sonny Bono
kind of way.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.836
What's that I hear?
A little chicken?

44:37.941 --> 44:39.238
[Clucks]

44:39.343 --> 44:42.335
- Chicken.
- Yeah. And very much so.

44:42.446 --> 44:43.913
I'm gonna go home now.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.177
- Seriously? You're leaving?
- [Brian] See ya at the chopper.

44:47.284 --> 44:51.414
Wow. Never thought I'd see the day
that taunt would lose its power.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.888
What about you?
Chicken with broccoli?

44:53.991 --> 44:57.222
Actually, part of me thinks
that it's incredibly stupid,

44:57.327 --> 44:59.488
and the other part is in agreement.

44:59.596 --> 45:01.496
- There you go.
- You're chicken.

45:01.598 --> 45:03.031
- Know what I think?
- What?

45:03.133 --> 45:07.160
I think that you had no intention
of going down this hill.

45:07.271 --> 45:11.401
I think that you dragged us up here
because you knew we wouldn't go down it.

45:11.508 --> 45:14.966
I think you were showing off.
That's what I think.

45:15.079 --> 45:16.637
Wait. You think I'm chicken?

45:16.747 --> 45:18.544
- I'm chicken?
- [Alicia laughs]

45:18.649 --> 45:22.380
Let me give a little clue here, okay?

45:22.486 --> 45:25.046
You think I'm chicken?
I'll show you.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.645
You see me?
I'm ready to go.

45:26.757 --> 45:29.351
Where are you?
Nowhere to be seen. Chicken.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.950
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

45:31.061 --> 45:32.653
- You're getting on?
- Yeah.

45:32.763 --> 45:34.731
- No!
- Come on, push off.

- Sorry.
- That's cool. It's okay.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

46:42.432 --> 46:45.868
- It's my fault you got sick.
- [Sniffling] It's not your fault.

46:45.969 --> 46:48.904
We even might have gotten sick
without tobogganing.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.474
It didn't help walking home

You look different.

- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

48:01.178 --> 48:04.079

Didn't somebody we know
have one of these?

48:08.385 --> 48:11.479
Yeah. Us.

48:11.588 --> 48:14.386
Maybe this'll help.

48:18.662 --> 48:22.098
Yeah. I remember.

48:37.948 --> 48:41.509
- So what's your deal anyway?
- My deal.

48:41.618 --> 48:44.587
I mean, sometimes you have
these moments of lucidity,

48:44.688 --> 48:46.849
but then other times

48:46.957 --> 48:50.051
it's just not so much normal.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.119
I don't understand, I mean,
I don't wanna be alone on Christmas.

48:54.231 --> 48:55.823
You've never been alone.

48:55.933 --> 48:59.494
On Christmas, it's not like
being alone. It's alone alone.

48:59.603 --> 49:02.094
This wouldn't be
one of those lucid moments.

49:02.205 --> 49:05.038
- I wasn't going for that.
- Okay, I see.

49:05.142 --> 49:07.906
All right, little Miss Grinch.

49:08.011 --> 49:10.571
I know you're a sophisticated,
modern woman

49:10.681 --> 49:14.947
that's very jaded and nothing
gets to you, and you have no emotions.

49:15.052 --> 49:17.020
But I'd be willing to bet
that even you,

49:17.120 --> 49:19.748
before you got old...

49:19.856 --> 49:21.721
...- er than you are now,

49:21.825 --> 49:26.159
but still as young, attractive,
smart and beautiful...

49:26.263 --> 49:28.163

49:28.265 --> 49:29.459
I don't know, like,

49:29.566 --> 49:34.128
some moment in your childhood
before everything got complicated,

49:34.237 --> 49:35.465
when you were happy.

49:35.572 --> 49:37.563
You must have some moment in your life

49:37.674 --> 49:40.939
that you'd like to go back and relive.

in the middle?

50:02.332 --> 50:04.732
It was completely frozen.

It was just...
It was incredible.

It completely stopped me
in my tracks.

I remember standing underneath it

pretending that I was a princess
in a magical crystal palace.

hold on to her.

55:37.233 --> 55:40.964
and pay her a quarter so she
could show us her goodies.

55:42.238 --> 55:43.569
How does this work?

55:43.673 --> 55:47.404
Oh, well. Here, let me...

55:47.510 --> 55:50.206
[Brian] What are you into?
Hot Cheerleaders,

55:50.313 --> 55:52.076
- Three-Way Fun.
- Uh-uh.

55:52.182 --> 55:54.946
- Middle-Aged Hotties.
- You're talkin' my language.

55:55.051 --> 55:59.920
Old enough to know how it's done,
young enough to still want to do it.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.491
- That's gross.
- Ooh.

56:02.592 --> 56:04.287
[Doo-Dah] Come to papa.

56:04.394 --> 56:06.624
[Brian] That's not bad, right?

56:09.666 --> 56:12.294
Dude, it's your mom!

56:12.402 --> 56:13.528
Oh, my God.

56:15.004 --> 56:17.370
Hey, can you print that for me?

56:18.975 --> 56:20.772
Mom, Dad, listen.

56:20.877 --> 56:22.469
Please, Drew has to go tonight.

56:22.579 --> 56:25.377
I cannot spend one more second
in this house with him.

56:25.482 --> 56:27.575
- Well, yeah?
- Yeah? So what?

56:27.684 --> 56:30.084
So he's making fools of us!

56:30.186 --> 56:31.915
- Of all of us!
- [Drew] Alicia?

56:32.021 --> 56:34.819
[Sighs] All right, look,
I'm gonna take the car,

56:34.924 --> 56:37.256
and when I get home,
I really hope he's gone.

56:37.360 --> 56:40.693
- Alicia.
- Be careful with the car.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.526
Can't we talk about this?

56:42.632 --> 56:44.623
No.

56:47.904 --> 56:50.134
- What the hell happened?
- [Drew] Nothing.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.073
I think she's right. It's stupid.

56:53.176 --> 56:54.541
This is a mistake.

56:54.644 --> 56:57.613
I've imposed on you folks
and I'm sorry.

56:57.714 --> 56:59.238
I'll write you a check.

56:59.349 --> 57:02.011
I'll spend Christmas...

57:02.118 --> 57:04.484
I'll spend Christmas somewhere.

57:04.587 --> 57:08.387
No. We don't want your money.

57:08.491 --> 57:12.393
In cash.
Check'll be just fine.

57:12.495 --> 57:14.861
- I'll get you a pen.
- [Phone rings]

57:14.964 --> 57:17.159
- What's wrong with you?
- Hello?

57:17.267 --> 57:19.667
<i>- Merry Christmas to you too.
- Missy!</i>

57:19.769 --> 57:22.738
The bracelet is amazing, Drew.
Thank you.

57:22.839 --> 57:26.036
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

57:26.142 --> 57:31.205
- How'd you know my favorite is Cartier?
- Lucky guess. How did you find me?

57:31.314 --> 57:35.273
I talked to your secretary and she said
you were with your family.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.647
Oh, Drew!

57:36.753 --> 57:40.245
I am so happy for you.
And for us.

57:40.356 --> 57:42.381
<i>- For us?
- I know what this means,</i>

57:42.492 --> 57:44.460
<i>reaching out to your family.</i>

57:44.561 --> 57:46.756
You want to be
more serious about yourself,

57:46.863 --> 57:48.990
and more serious about me.

57:49.566 --> 57:51.796
I wanna meet your family, Drew.

57:51.901 --> 57:54.631
I'm sure you will,
and they wanna meet you one day.

57:54.737 --> 57:56.295
Oh, great.

57:56.406 --> 57:58.636
Then we can go to Fiji.

57:58.741 --> 58:01.403
How about tomorrow?

58:01.511 --> 58:04.378
Fiji? Tomorrow?
You're kidding.

58:04.481 --> 58:07.575
That's fabulous, actually.
That's perfect.

58:07.684 --> 58:12.587
Then tonight we can spend Christmas Eve
together with our families.

58:12.689 --> 58:14.680
Ah...

58:14.791 --> 58:17.988
That's gonna be hard
to pull off, you know?

58:18.094 --> 58:22.758
It's very short notice, and we...

58:22.866 --> 58:28.236
One of the family members
is challenged, and...

58:28.338 --> 58:31.933
[clears throat]... requires
a lot of time to put on

58:32.041 --> 58:34.271
- the proper headgear...
- Oh. No problem.

58:34.377 --> 58:36.572
- [Seatbelts unlatching]
- We're here.

58:36.679 --> 58:39.045
- You're here?
- Look outside!

58:46.956 --> 58:49.186
Oh, my God!
You're here?!

58:50.560 --> 58:54.394
I mean, oh, my gosh!
You're totally here!

58:56.366 --> 58:58.163
My girlfriend's family is here!

58:58.268 --> 59:00.759
You have to help me!
Pretend for a couple hours!

59:00.870 --> 59:02.997
We'll leave by midnight.
I'm begging you!

59:03.106 --> 59:05.438
Read paragraph three.
You bailed, it's done.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.978
- You write the check and get out!
- What? No! Wait a minute!

59:09.078 --> 59:11.342
Okay, look, I wanna go!
I'm dying to go!

59:11.447 --> 59:13.915
I gotta have a life to go back to!
This girl is it!

59:14.017 --> 59:16.144
I can't tell her I rented a family.

59:16.252 --> 59:18.447
I'm sure she already knows
you're crazy.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.615
- It kinda shows.
- A deal's a deal. That's it.

59:21.724 --> 59:24.887
- Unless you sweeten the pot.
- That's extortion, Tom!

59:24.994 --> 59:27.462
- I think I hear the doorbell.
- No! No, no! Wait!

59:27.564 --> 59:30.863
No, no! I'll give you
another 75 grand. Okay?

59:30.967 --> 59:32.992
But you gotta do it good,
you gotta try.

59:33.102 --> 59:35.195
Or else I'll be so mad
at you guys!

59:35.305 --> 59:36.704
- [Doorbell]
- Come on.

59:36.806 --> 59:39.240
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- [Drew] Fine! Sure!

59:40.476 --> 59:42.774
- Missy!
- Hey, Drew.

59:42.879 --> 59:44.710
Mrs. Vangilder. Captain.

59:44.814 --> 59:45.838
Come on in.

59:45.949 --> 59:48.247
Merry Christmas.
Honey. Merry Christmas.

59:48.351 --> 59:50.376
Welcome to my childhood home.

59:50.486 --> 59:51.817
[Chuckling] Come on in.

59:51.921 --> 59:53.013
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:53.122 --> 59:55.352
I'm Drew's father,
and this is his mother.

59:55.458 --> 59:56.482
- Christine.
- Mom.

59:56.593 --> 59:57.651
Letitia. Horace.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.388
And he's our son.
There's no doubt about that.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.555
[Drew chuckling] That's for sure.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:02.765
[Awkward silence]

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:05.097
[Awkward silence]

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.810
Oh!

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:18.847
I would love to see pictures of Drew
when he was small.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.917
Oh, we're not gonna bore everyone,
that's embarrassing.

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.883
Good idea.
Bath time for baby.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.318
- Oh.
- [Chuckling]

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:28.288
- Thanks, Mom.
- Look at him.

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:29.983
Drew, are you sure that's you?

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.425
Oh, that's me all right.
I remember it well.

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.826
That was in autumn
and the photographer...

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:38.867
No, I don't think so.
There's no little dingle.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.698
- Nope.
- No.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.931
[Drew] Yes. It's there, but it's not...

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.704
You can't see it, because it was
so long that Mom had to tuck it back

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.904
when she gave me a bath.
It got tangled.

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.811
- You remember, Mom.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:55.145
From the moment he was born, it was...

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.516
...freakishly long.
- [Chuckling] Right. Yes.

01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.952
- [Knocking]
- I'll get it.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.353
No, no, no!

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.550
I'll get it, son.
You stay right there.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.628
[Chuckling] Thanks, Dad.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.719
- So, here we are.
- Yeah.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.425
So are we keeping you folks
from dinner plans, or...

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.263
No, we don't have any plans.

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.064
We couldn't possibly impose.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.071
[Horace] We just got here.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.698
Oh, okay.
Who was that, Dad?

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:22.810
Doo-Dah.

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.312
Doo-Dah.
Doo-Dah's my grandpa.

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:27.781
- He'll tell us stories...
- I wanna meet him.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.909
...about the 1800s.
I know you do.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.283
We don't usually
leave him outside.

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.356
We usually let him in, Dad.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.425
- Let's talk, son.
- [Drew] Okay.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.323
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.658
This guy says he's Doo-Dah's understudy.

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:43.698
- He's not white.
- That's fine, just let him in.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.324
They don't know he's not right.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.596
- They don't know him!
- Want me to let him in?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.796
- Fine!
- Please, Tom.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.430
This is my grandfather, Doo-Dah.
Here he is.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.135
Sweet Jim Jiminy,
cold corn in the mornin'!

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.835
Ooh. Who are you?

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.505
I'm Saul's understudy.
I just came to help out.

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.206
<i>[Understudy] Feliz navidad.</i>

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:03.080
- Is he black?
- Yep.

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.786
I can't do it.
I cannot do it.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:11.348
My family's this close to 350.
You're not gonna weasel out now!

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.793
Put some maple syrup
on the ham.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.364
- Drew?
- Huh?

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.066
Ah! Ah!

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.677
I'm sorry!
Oh, Jesus!

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.111
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:35.207
I'm gonna leave right away.
I don't want to cause problems.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:37.980
- Drew, listen.
- I'm in a bit of a jam now.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:41.386
- Drew, Drew, wait.
- What? Yes?

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:45.222
I came back here because
I wanted to apologize to you.

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:48.729
Yes, the thing in the park
was a bit garish and obnoxious,

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.458
but that's you.

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.534
Not that you're garish and obnoxious,

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.865
it's just that you
do things in a big way.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.529
Yes, I do, I do.

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:59.199
And I'm touched.

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:02.903
- Thank you. That means...
- And thank you.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:16.188
You smell like fear.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.230
- There have been some developments...
- I have a gift for you.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.321
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.228
No! Hi!

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.929
[Laughing] Hi, honey.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.405
Your mom sent me in here
to get a cheeseball.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:36.968
- What's that?
- This is a cheeseball.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:40.947
Let's play a game where you don't
come back till they eat the whole thing.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.781
[Chuckling] This is great.
Your family isn't what I expected.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.855
I'm glad you wanted to introduce me.

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.856
- It's all I ever wanted.
- Me too.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.153
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. All right.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.955
Yes. I know.
I love you. Okay.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:56.930
- Fiji's gonna be great.
- It will be great. Fiji time!

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:06.100
That's what this was about?
You put us through this for a girl?

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.507
No, no, no.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.203
Just...

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.049
- Can I open my present now?
- Sure.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.948
I thought this was because
you had a painful childhood.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.457
I'm sorry. You said you
never wanted to see me,

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.618
so I accepted that.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:29.664
I was broken up with her, but she
showed up and wanted to meet my family.

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:32.529
I couldn't tell them
it was a rented family.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:36.537
I know you hate me. I hate me.
I hate my own guts.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.472
I know this is horrible,
but would you just please,

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:41.839
could you help me,
so I can get through this?

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:44.845
You'll never see me again.
Just take a ride for an hour.

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:47.142
Your parents will call you
when it's clear.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:51.414
[Christine] Drew,
your dad wants more salami!

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.782
They're playing along?

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.223
Your parents, they're crazy.
They think it's fun.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:59.089
I'm sorry.
Okay? I gotta go.

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.095
I'll see you.
I miss you. Thank you.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.495
You're welcome. See ya.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.697
They think it's fun, huh?

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:14.700
Maybe they're right.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:14.911
Your tree, Christine, it's so colorful.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.539
Your tree, Christine, it's so colorful.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:20.207
You know, it reminds me of Mexico.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.753
Not the better hotels, but the colors
of the simple people.

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:27.152
It's so bright and vulgar.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.419
- [Chuckles]
- Mom! Dad! I'm home!

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:34.929
[Christine] Alicia, you're back.
You're back, Alicia.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.862
Oh, you're back.

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:40.265
This is our daughter, Alicia.
This is Mrs. Vangilder.

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:42.428
Please. Letitia.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:45.098
I'm so pleased to meet you. Really.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:47.107
And this is our little Missy.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:50.303
Oh, Missy, Missy.

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:55.716
Oh, gosh. I've just heard
so much about you from Drew.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.218
God, you're gorgeous.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:01.984
And you are so not fat.
Drew! What's the matter with you?

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.683
I'm sorry?

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.624
- Drew, I'm not fat.
- No.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.697
- I was just thinking that.
- You must be Mr. Vangilder.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.891
- I would never say that.
- Don't mind us.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.365
We're a bunch of kidders.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.299
I like the family.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.963
Oh, well, you obviously
haven't met Brian.

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:20.042
By the way, where is Brian?

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.444
[Whimpering]

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.213
Here.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.449
Your mom's startin' to like
your grandfather hittin' on her.

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:38.254
There's one you don't often hear
on Christmas Eve.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.453
[Missy laughing]

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.429
It's unbelievable.
Poor thing. Poor thing.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.658
- Excuse me.
- It's true.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:47.258
What's happening over here?
What's going on?

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.931
- I'm learning so much from your sister.
- Oh, you are. Great.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.338
I didn't know you were
a baton twirler.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:56.502
Yeah. Gave away the big secret,
I guess, didn't you?

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:59.012
Oh, not the big one,
so don't push me.

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.515
Let's go talk to Doo-Dah.
He's telling stor...

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.642
I want you to see
the bracelet Drew got me.

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:06.654
Ooh, Cartier, huh?

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.951
Wow. Look at that.
That's just beautiful.

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.185
Well, that's my brother.

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.694
Just never afraid to put
a price tag on his feelings.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.994
Yeah. That's my sister.
Never understanding there's love,

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.466
you can care and
want to show it in a big way,

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:23.868
and you shouldn't be put down
and mocked, and made hurt feelings.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:27.932
When you love somebody,
you don't have to show it in a big way.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.707
So you were slumming when you
were making out with me in the kitchen?

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.550
It's a very, very affectionate family.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.817
- We show our love.
- Italians.

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.756
We're just very warm.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.385
Red hot, even.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:50.829
All right, that's it.
Give me this. Get up.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.662
- Sit down!
- [Christine] Okay!

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.463
Who wants a tour of the house?

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:57.733
- What you're using are stairs.
- [Squeaking]

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.070
We like these for going up.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.337
This is the bathroom.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.443
- What are you doing to me?
- What?

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:10.041
- You're killing me.
- No, I'm just playing along, brother.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:12.677
I think Missy likes me.
She thinks I'm funny.

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:15.484
This was little Drew's room.
Now, it's Brian's.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.649
Aw.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.386
Brian, don't be rude.
We have guests.

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:22.862
He'd live in front of the screen
if we'd let him right, Tom?

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.593
It's that insatiable appetite
for knowledge.

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.225
Oh, shit!

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:29.395
Brian, what have you done?!

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.269
- Tom, I don't know what that is.
- I do.

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:36.140
It's my wife shooting a "V"
for victory with her legs.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.679
It's been a while,
but that's what it looks like.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.682
- [Letitia] Honestly.
- That's my little girl.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.514
- Horace, get our coats.
- What's going on?

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.679
You have no idea.
Missy, get your coat!

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.848
- There's ham!
- [Missy] We're not going.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.983
- We'll stay.
- [Christine] Lighten up.

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:54.062
It's just a picture.
I had pictures taken for fun.

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.290
Where would you get
that stupid idea?!

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:03.399
Coats! Someone say coats?
Get the coats. Gotta get coats.

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.001
[Missy screams]

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.633
[Chuckles] Oh.

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:16.743
Some things cannot be unseen.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:19.479
Brian? Brian?

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:22.716
[Tom] Great.
Just great, Christine.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.264
I'll be at the Travel Lodge.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.732
[Door slams]

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:41.839
- Merry Christmas.
- Mom? Mom?

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:44.879
- Oh, dear God.
- Wait a minute!

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:46.810
There's more of Mom's buffet.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:50.283
If you think we're staying
after that display, think again.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.082
[Letitia] Trollops who
pose for dirty pictures,

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.953
various incestuous overtones

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:58.686
and old, unexplained men.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.592
This is without a doubt
the worst Christmas I've...

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:04.222
Oh, shut up, Letitia!

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.494
What?

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:10.470
I'll tell you what. I've put up with
your high and mighty act for 25 years,

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:11.904
but they don't have to.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.999
I don't remember you being superior
when you got knocked up

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:18.637
by Skippy Altsheller
and then tricked me into marrying you.

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:23.646
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry, Missy.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:28.018
Missy, darling, it's not true.
You were premature.

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.523
Oh, come on, Letitia!

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:34.995
Tell your mother thanks, Drew.
And Merry Christmas.

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.831
Missy, we'll wait for you in the car.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:42.267
[Grunts] You know, really.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:45.865
Yuletide's a bitch, ain't it?

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:48.205
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:52.076
Okay! Fiji.
Let's go to Fiji right now.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.809
You're right, Drew.
Just screw family.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.784
All we need is each other.
Just take me away.

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:02.023
I'm sorry, Missy. I can't.

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:06.083
Just go home, okay?
I'm sorry about all this.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.655
I'll spend Christmas alone.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.300
Oh, fine.

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:18.964
[Sobbing] Okay.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:22.769
Well, then...

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:25.972
...the only thing
I have left to say to you

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.140
is I am keeping this bracelet.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:34.956
I feel bad drinking liquor
you're gonna need.

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.422
I better go.

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:39.585
- Merry Christmas.
- All right.

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:43.027
[Letitia] Missy, get in the car!

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.895
My God!

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.164
Have you lost your mind?
Did you just lose it in there?

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.840
You know, I have to ask,

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.974
just how bad is your real family

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.282
that you would rather
spend your Christmas like this?

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:20.624
There was no real family.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.799
What do you mean,
"there is no family"?

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.431
You must've had a family.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:29.943
I mean, you must've had
a Doo-Dah, right?

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.843
I had a friend whose grandfather,

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:35.974
was called Doo-Dah.
I always liked that.

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:41.981
My dad walked out on us on Christmas

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.683
when I was four.

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.192
It was basically
just me and my mom.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:52.325
She was a waitress
at the 24-hour coffee shop.

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:56.928
She didn't have a lot of money,
so when Christmas came around,

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:01.567
it was an opportunity for her
to take a double shift. She did.

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:06.114
And, you know,
my Christmases were,

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:10.675
basically, I just kind of
sat around the house, you know?

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.981
Then at night,
I'd walk down there,

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:17.491
and Mom would always buy me
a grown-up stack of pancakes,

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:21.085
and I would sit by myself
at the end of the counter

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.754
and eat 'em.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:28.064
I did that for Christmas every year
until I turned 18.

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.139
I haven't been able to walk
in a coffee shop since, though.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.003
Where's your mom now?

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:36.236
Mom died when I was in college.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.543
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.712
[Alicia] You know what?

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:46.720
There's nothing that you can do
about those Christmases.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:49.347
But the one that you
can do something about,

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:54.589
the one that's here and now, you just
spent that destroying my family.

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:57.563
Alicia, just for the record,

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.861
I didn't destroy your family.

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.027
What are you talking about?

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.628
Your parents are splitting up.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.106
It's obvious.
Brian knows it.

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:11.168
That's why he spends all his time
in his room on his computer.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.511
You just didn't wanna see it.
I can understand that.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.842
I'm gonna go get my dad.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.443
Lock up when you leave.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.805
Well, all right.

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:23.378
I forgive you.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:47.229
<i>No! No, Spirit! No!</i>

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:51.397
<i>I will honor Christmas in my heart
and try to keep it all the year.</i>

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.770
[Knocking]

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:56.105
No one's home!

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:57.542
[Knocking]

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.113
[Groans]

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:02.514
What?

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.983
[Knocking]

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.951
I hear you.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.316
- Are you gonna hit me?
- No.

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.951
Are you gonna do something else
that still hurts?

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:18.230
No. You gonna invite me in?

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.597
You just stopped by
to hang out and catch up?

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:23.933
- Reminisce?
- You owe me money.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.934
Right. The money.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.944
Okay, come on in.
I'll get my checkbook.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:48.088
You rented my place
when you could've been staying here?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.867
Well, I gotta admit, this is nice.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.301
Thanks.

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.507
You still splitting up with Christine?

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:03.806
[Tom] Yeah. I guess.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:07.411
That would be a shame.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.074
[Laughs]

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.985
What are you laughing at?

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:15.921
Nothing. It's just ironic.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:18.458
I paid all that money
to be part of your family.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.290
You're giving it away for nothing.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.492
[Drew] Look at this.

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:27.363
That's the ticket to Doo-Dah's play.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.334
Yeah. I got mine too.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:43.848
[Tom] I'm not very good at apologizing.
I don't know if they're in there.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.943
[Drew] Come on.
What do you have to lose?

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:51.683
[Doo-Dah] What do you want with me?

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.556
[Marley] Much.

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.220
[Doo-Dah] Who are you?

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.890
In life, I was your partner...

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.125
See anybody?

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.134
That's Doo-Dah right there.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.067
What is the reason
for this visit?

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:05.731
It is getting late
and I've been hard at work.

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.172
He's not that bad.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.072
[Marley] To warn you, Ebenezer.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.270
He's not that good either.

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:13.279
I'm gonna find Christine.

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:16.282
[Marley] Learn from me.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:21.980
My spirit never walked
beyond our counting house.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:28.552
It never roved beyond
our money-changing hole.

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.790
So I am condemned

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.834
to wander through the world

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.961
to see what I might have
shared on Earth,

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:40.371
then turned to happiness.

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.510
What are you doing here?

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.080
[Doo-Dah] You were always
a good businessman.

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:48.672
Doo-Dah's family, right?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.149
Brian. It's me, move over.

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:57.623
No, man. Go find one
of the other empty seats.

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.887
Move over, Bri. Come on.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.459
- Where's your sister?
- [Both] Shh.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.902
- Dear Brother!
- Fanny!

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.602
Christine...

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:20.845
If I were to leave,
I wouldn't even know where to go.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.545
Then why leave?

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:27.250
That's what I'm sayin'.
I don't wanna leave.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.448
Then don't.

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:35.391
- All right, I won't.
- Okay.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:39.901
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.969
It's good.

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:54.138
Bri, that girl...
She's kinda cute for you.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.807
- Talk to her.
- Stop it.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:59.011
- She's gonna hear.
- I saw you looking at her.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.917
- Stop.
- I can tell you like...

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.512
I can hear you.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:06.020
[Chuckling]

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.424
That's embarrassing.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.724
That's our grandfather.
This is Brian.

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:14.063
There, Brian.
You're all set.

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.899
I'm sorry.

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.668
Is that your brother?

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.647
Yeah.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:30.240
How do we travel exactly?

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:33.844
Through the air. We fly!

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:35.681
Not so hard!

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.917
- Wedgie! Wedgie!
- [People laughing]

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.673
[Drew] Alicia?

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:03.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:06.519
Were you in there
the whole time?

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:09.317
No. I was just here
to pick up my mom.

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:15.319
She's in there with your dad.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.593
They're kinda making out
in the third row.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.998
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.364
- That's good.
- Look.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:28.306
I don't expect you to want
to talk to me or anything,

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:33.245
so I'm not gonna bother you
and give you a hard time,

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:36.840
camp outside your place
and stalk you and you know.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.943
But I do want to say that I'm sorry

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:42.581
for what I put you through

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.750
and say thank you.

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:56.769
So who are you renting
for New Year's

01:22:56.871 --> 01:23:00.204
'cause you know, us Valcos,
we book up kind of fast.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.208
[Drew] I see that.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.108
And I'd get on it if I were you.

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:09.149
I'm lookin' for a family
with maybe a bearded,

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.845
irascible dad
with a heart of gold.

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:19.382
A brother who stays in his room
all the time by himself,

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:23.760
and a sister who is...

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:29.801
...wonderful and smart,

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:33.797
and really beautiful.

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:38.675
Because I think that's
the kind of person that...

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:43.675
...I could fall in love with.

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:47.653
You know anybody like that?
I know it's tough.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:48.882
Let me think.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.083
Not offhand,
but I'll get back to you.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.126
Let me know.

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:56.197
<i>[Judy Garland: Have Yourself
A Merry Little Christmas]</i>

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:12.336
- [Horace] I hear you, dear.
- [Missy] Daddy, stop the car!

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:14.547
Oh, my God!

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.644
Oh, my God!

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.819
He's kissing his sister.

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:24.616
- [Letitia] That is open-mouth.
- 'Tis the season to be jolly.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:28.059
- [Letitia] Get us out of here!
- [Horace] They're tryin' to keep warm.

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:30.222
[Letitia] Come on!
