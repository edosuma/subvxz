Know where I belong.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.866
You've always wanted control
over your power.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.936
Don't throw it away
because...
(BEEPING)

13:57.938 --> 13:59.671
(RED HULK GRUNTING)

13:59.673 --> 14:01.873
He's gaining on us!

14:05.845 --> 14:08.279
He's not going to stop.
He won't.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.949
Not until he's
destroyed everything.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.851
Avengers, we're headed
for the Tower.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.353
Do whatever you can
to hold him here.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.556
Don't take too long.
(GRUNTING)

14:18.558 --> 14:19.858
(GROANS)

14:19.860 --> 14:22.026
Or take as long as you like.

14:22.028 --> 14:25.496
I'm beginning to enjoy this.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.733
BLACK WIDOW: You think
you can control yourself?
Time to find out.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.035
IRON MAN: So, yeah,
this'll get you there.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.871
You sure you're up
for the trip?

14:32.873 --> 14:35.506
We can find another way
to stop Red.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.141
You don't have to do this.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.878
How many cities will turn
to ash while we search?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.046
This is the fastest way.

14:44.850 --> 14:45.917
(POWERING UP)

14:52.224 --> 14:55.226
FRIDAY: <i> Incoming message</i>
<i>from Captain America.</i>

14:55.228 --> 14:57.095
Red's moving east
toward New York.

IRON MAN: <i> What happened</i>
<i>to your Hulkbuster suit?</i>

14:59.032 --> 15:01.900
They were good
while they lasted.
How we looking?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.835
Just waiting for a go
from the big guy.

15:06.372 --> 15:07.939
Do it.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.943
Here goes... Something.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.982
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

15:24.390 --> 15:26.557
Gamma levels to 200%.

300%. 500%.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.996
(GROANING)

15:33.565 --> 15:36.100

No!

15:58.425 --> 16:01.125
We created
another monster!

(GROWLING)

16:05.397 --> 16:08.599
(GROANING)

16:08.601 --> 16:11.135
(GRUNTS)
Don't hurt him!

16:11.137 --> 16:14.005
Probably not
gonna be an issue.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.142
(GROWLING)

16:18.144 --> 16:21.179
Get control!
I know you're still in there.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.115
We need you.
The world needs the Hulk!

16:24.117 --> 16:28.019
BRUCE BANNER: This is it.
This is why you came back.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.621
Focus. Control.

Show 'em what we got,
big guy.
BLACK WIDOW: Big Guy?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.530
Snap out of it, Hulk.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.369
(SIGHS) Widow?
You good?

16:44.371 --> 16:48.439
Yeah. Hulk is...
I'm good.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.541
What is it?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.111
Banner says we could use this
to power him down.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.180
Says you'd know what to do.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.683
Siphoning his gamma power
into you.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.685
Uh, yeah.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.955
That could actually work,
if you can handle it.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.790
Just get ready.
Only one shot at this.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.526

No matter how hard you try,
you can't win.

Wanna know why?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.922

the Avengers!

Turn it on, Widow.

what he's doing.
He does.

Be strong and end this.

Now maybe... A nap.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.750
(SNORING)

20:28.360 --> 20:31.362
Apologies
for my rash methods.

20:31.364 --> 20:36.267
A good leader doesn't leave
his men in the field
to fend for themselves.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.102
"Leader"?
"Men"?

20:38.104 --> 20:41.239
I'll be out of action
while the docs clear me.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.907
But at least
you'll have a Hulk

20:42.909 --> 20:45.676
to deal with threats
as big as me.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.579
All right.
Get him out of here.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.415
Proud of yourself?
Yeah. Pretty much.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.352
You were useful...
This time.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.021
Only when a threat
this massive presents itself.

20:57.023 --> 21:01.025
However, we don't need
a nuclear weapon
when dynamite will do.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.327
You can collar him, Stark.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.603
