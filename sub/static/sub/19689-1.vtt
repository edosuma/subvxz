WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:01.901
Previously on Underground...

00:01.933 --> 00:04.908
I think I found it,
the way to the promised land.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.234
It's-it's a song.

00:06.268 --> 00:08.837
The map may be hidden in the words.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.838
It's gonna be the slaves
left behind that's gonna

00:10.872 --> 00:13.251
- pay the price.
- Don't act like you care about nobody else.

00:13.275 --> 00:14.509
You only care about yourself.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.376
That's why I don't mean
to be left behind.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.281
Mama, you ever
think about another life?

00:20.314 --> 00:23.051
Yes. I've imagined
thousands of different lives.

00:23.084 --> 00:24.764
You think you're better
than me, don't you?

00:27.770 --> 00:29.130
We have to go. Now.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.258
We gotta run!

00:31.910 --> 00:32.779
Run!

00:32.812 --> 00:34.581
I've never had a runaway before.

00:34.614 --> 00:36.599
If my paddy rollers haven't
retrieved them by nightfall,

00:36.623 --> 00:38.017
consider yourself hired.

00:38.050 --> 00:41.020
Do whatever it takes to get her free!

00:41.053 --> 00:42.021
These are papers,

00:42.054 --> 00:43.589
for you and your daughter.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.066
You can't trust nothing that woman says.

00:45.090 --> 00:46.913
There gonna be catchers on their heel

00:46.947 --> 00:48.595
every step of the way.

00:48.627 --> 00:51.297
There's a price
on your head, dead or alive.

00:51.331 --> 00:53.266
Calling y'all the Macon 7!

00:53.298 --> 00:55.816
I killed her.
I protect my babies.

00:56.502 --> 00:58.724
We suspect there might be
someone aiding runaways

00:58.749 --> 00:59.617
in the area.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.642
Hyah!

01:00.672 --> 01:03.104
Slave catchers are flooding the area,
looking for the high reward.

01:03.128 --> 01:06.113
There's nothing stopping me
from putting you on the block.

01:06.442 --> 01:07.410
What do you want?

01:07.442 --> 01:08.611
I want to be counted!

01:08.644 --> 01:11.213
It's our hands that built this country.

01:13.455 --> 01:15.025
Noah the one
that brought us the freedom.

01:15.049 --> 01:17.736
But he gave up his freedom for me.

01:17.769 --> 01:20.757
Wherever he is, he's still fighting.

01:21.477 --> 01:23.759
All that's behind you now.

01:23.791 --> 01:25.236
No, it ain't.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.796
I'm going back.

"Sol..."

03:46.534 --> 03:48.203
"d..."

03:48.235 --> 03:51.806
"Sol... di..."

03:54.443 --> 03:56.745
Sol...

03:56.777 --> 03:59.213
"Soldier." Soldier.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.748
Soldier.

04:27.074 --> 04:29.153
Move! Towards the water!

04:29.185 --> 04:30.478
Go!

04:57.506 --> 04:58.941
Hold! Make another move,

04:58.973 --> 05:00.408
and I'll shoot your head clean off.

05:00.442 --> 05:02.911
I could say the same.

05:04.211 --> 05:07.348
My arms are mighty tired,
and I aim to end this quick.

05:07.382 --> 05:08.860
It's gonna be over quick you don't shut

05:08.884 --> 05:10.501
your mouth, put them weapons down.

05:10.533 --> 05:11.873
Ain't nobody got to die today.

05:11.906 --> 05:13.659
Not over no hurt nigger.
Ain't that right?

05:13.692 --> 05:15.285
Gonna be more trouble than it's worth,

05:15.298 --> 05:17.467
trying to get a man who
can't walk to collect a reward.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.902
Anybody can see his ankle broken.

05:18.935 --> 05:20.514
So how's about we make
a sale right here?

05:20.538 --> 05:22.073
I's give you five dollars for him.

05:22.105 --> 05:24.995
Same as y'all would've got,
and five for your hassle.

05:25.029 --> 05:27.200
We got three runaways,
you want to pay us for one?

05:27.877 --> 05:29.903
You ain't got nothin' yet.

05:31.151 --> 05:34.351
Ten dollars or two bullets,
it's your choice.

05:34.716 --> 05:37.055
I ain't scared of no nigger bitches.

05:40.391 --> 05:42.672
And ain't nobody scared of you.

05:44.295 --> 05:48.432
My daddy taught me how
to carve up a tree real good.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.554
I imagine your skin would be
a bit easier to handle.

05:53.137 --> 05:56.007
Now, you heard me say my arms is tired.

05:56.906 --> 05:58.865
So what's it gonna be?

06:06.324 --> 06:10.137
Every injury includes
a violation of a right.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.539
This is as true today

06:11.571 --> 06:14.187
as it was when Justice Wilson
said it 60 years ago.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.845
Justice Wilson also stated
that property is a right...

06:17.878 --> 06:22.049
and lawful power,
which a person has to a thing.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.718
Objection. How does this
apply to a murder case?

06:24.751 --> 06:26.263
The crime is not murder.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.987
It is theft.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.523
The accused is, himself,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.893
stolen property, above all,
and must be extradited south.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.739
- For the love of God, John, you're an abolitionist.
- My political beliefs

06:35.763 --> 06:38.065
do not trump my vow to uphold the law.

06:38.097 --> 06:41.795
And they certainly don't trump
my familial ties, Mr. Crane.

06:41.828 --> 06:44.104
Mr. Hawkes, the accused
is a runaway who...

06:44.138 --> 06:45.904
Your Honor, under
the Fugitive Slave Act,

06:45.938 --> 06:48.576
the accused is still
the property of Suzanna Macon.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.761
What he did in Ohio, while...

06:50.795 --> 06:52.679
reprehensible...

06:52.713 --> 06:55.469
is secondary to the property crime.

06:55.503 --> 06:57.171
Therefore, Noah Macon

06:57.205 --> 06:59.015
- must be returned to Georgia.
- Objection, Your Honor!

06:59.039 --> 07:00.207
Overruled.

07:00.241 --> 07:02.176
His argument is not without merit.

07:02.648 --> 07:04.020
However, I'm well aware
of the stall tactics

07:04.044 --> 07:05.356
that you're referencing, Mr. Crane.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.775
Mr. Hawkes, I woke up to yet another

07:07.808 --> 07:09.873
stack of papers...
would you care to summarize?

07:09.905 --> 07:11.852
My client fears that while we wrestle

07:11.885 --> 07:13.197
over semantics in this courtroom,

07:13.221 --> 07:14.656
what is rightfully hers

07:14.688 --> 07:15.818
is rotting away.

07:16.524 --> 07:19.560
He's been in there the north
side of five months, Your Honor.

07:19.594 --> 07:21.262
Who knows what kind of state he's in?

07:44.449 --> 07:46.213
Chow time!

08:03.538 --> 08:05.941
We do it tomorrow
or we can't do it at all.

08:05.974 --> 08:07.676
The guards got guns.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.411
That's why we're
gonna get our own weapons.

08:09.443 --> 08:11.912
- Maybe we hold back a bit.
- We can't.

08:11.945 --> 08:14.448
Two days' time, they gonna
roll us back to Tennessee.

08:14.481 --> 08:16.183
Maybe massa won't punish.

08:16.217 --> 08:18.053
Remember what happened to Renwick?

08:18.085 --> 08:19.853
Of course I remember Renwick.

08:19.887 --> 08:21.690
We ain't gonna end up like him.

08:51.312 --> 08:53.154
It's my fault they caught us.

08:53.186 --> 08:54.788
Sometimes we just get unlucky.

08:54.821 --> 08:56.991
Bad luck's been going around.

08:57.025 --> 08:58.627
Pastor Grant, the GrimkÃ© sisters.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.996
Everybody's running into patrols
across the river.

09:01.028 --> 09:03.897
They ain't follow us.
Moses paid 'em off.

09:03.931 --> 09:05.834
Really?

09:06.336 --> 09:08.239
You'd be surprised
how many times it's worked.

09:09.231 --> 09:12.506
They just want the money,
not the trouble.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.943
Some of them want the trouble, too.

09:14.975 --> 09:16.440
Remember that.

09:16.777 --> 09:19.080
It's feeling mighty cold in here.

09:19.113 --> 09:21.550
I'll get some more wood on the fire.

09:27.961 --> 09:29.757
Harriet gonna
want to keep movin'.

09:29.791 --> 09:32.426
- He can't travel.
- You might have to stay here, too.

09:33.169 --> 09:34.907
We had a good day in court today.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.097
I think the judge is seriously
considering my motion

09:37.131 --> 09:38.466
to send him back south.

09:38.498 --> 09:39.600
- When?
- Could be soon.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.168
They've granted my request to...

09:41.201 --> 09:43.637
inspect Suzanna's property.

09:44.081 --> 09:46.206
But there's gonna be guards
with us the whole time.

09:49.042 --> 09:52.012
I haven't seen him in so long.

09:52.046 --> 09:53.425
I know.

09:54.181 --> 09:56.316
What if this don't go our way?

09:56.349 --> 09:58.686
Then I'll keep filing motions,
prolong the process,

09:58.719 --> 10:00.854
keep stalling this trial
till we figure out

10:00.887 --> 10:02.423
a way to get him back.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.489
Got a lot of night left.
With a bit of rest.

10:35.522 --> 10:37.658
Food in their bellies.
We ought to push on.

10:37.691 --> 10:39.594
Well, Valentine's break is bad.

10:39.627 --> 10:41.429
Infection might be settling in.

10:41.461 --> 10:43.097
I figured as much. I told Miss Elizabeth

10:43.131 --> 10:45.500
to wire ahead, let 'em know
the cargo gonna be light.

10:45.532 --> 10:48.235
Mary can get him some medicine
from the hospital,

10:48.268 --> 10:49.375
help him heal faster.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.986
I suppose that means
you stayin' behind, too.

10:53.641 --> 10:55.944
John say they may move Noah soon.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.512
This plan of yours is dangerous.

10:58.546 --> 11:00.849
Everything we do is dangerous.

11:00.882 --> 11:03.084
There's a world of difference
between you stealing away

11:03.117 --> 11:05.386
with somebody in the night
and stealing them

11:05.419 --> 11:07.330
from an armed chain gang headed south.

11:07.888 --> 11:10.591
The Lord sent you to me
to get your family back.

11:11.210 --> 11:14.061
You ain't gonna be able to do
that you-you dead or in chains.

11:14.094 --> 11:16.431
Noah is my family.

11:16.464 --> 11:18.747
He gave up his freedom for Boo and me.

11:18.781 --> 11:20.268
He ain't blood.

11:21.102 --> 11:23.059
And hearts change.

11:25.839 --> 11:28.209
I know John hurt you,
but this ain't like

11:28.242 --> 11:29.739
when you went back for him.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.986
Road you got ahead of you, 600 miles.

11:35.018 --> 11:36.383
Deep South.

11:36.416 --> 11:37.893
Stealing yours from the hell

11:37.926 --> 11:39.793
you barely escaped, then 600 miles

11:39.826 --> 11:41.789
back through enemy territory.

11:41.823 --> 11:43.489
You did it with your kin.

11:43.522 --> 11:46.128
Maryland ain't Georgia. You got
to keep your head straight.

11:48.028 --> 11:50.073
This rescue gonna be the
toughest thing you ever done.

11:50.097 --> 11:52.433
And Noah gonna be able to help.
I'll get him back.

11:52.465 --> 11:54.882
Together, we're gonna get
the rest of my family.

13:56.791 --> 13:57.959
All up now!

14:29.990 --> 14:31.258
All up now!

14:46.556 --> 14:47.709
All up now!

14:59.954 --> 15:01.955
All up now! All up now!

15:20.874 --> 15:23.543
Hair and nails are a good
indication of health.

15:23.576 --> 15:25.112
Teeth, as well.

15:25.146 --> 15:26.546
No rot.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.982
That's a good sign.

15:28.014 --> 15:31.051
Turn around. Lift up your feet.

15:31.084 --> 15:32.552
Higher.

15:32.585 --> 15:35.022
- No sores.
- If the judgment falls

15:35.056 --> 15:36.724
my client's way, she'd like him

15:36.757 --> 15:38.459
on the first transport back to Georgia.

15:38.492 --> 15:40.570
Well, there's something heading
that way tomorrow evening,

15:40.594 --> 15:42.296
hauling back two
runaways from Tennessee.

15:43.749 --> 15:45.166
Back around.

15:48.169 --> 15:50.040
Take a look at his eyes.

15:52.672 --> 15:54.984
- What am I supposed to be seeing?
- Not a speck of yellow.

15:55.008 --> 15:57.244
No jaundice. He's in good shape.

15:57.892 --> 15:59.479
Yeah, I'd like to keep it that way.

15:59.512 --> 16:01.525
You're not taking him across
the Red Creek bridge, are you?

16:01.549 --> 16:04.085
That thing looks like a devil's
grin. It's falling apart.

16:04.117 --> 16:05.653
I just put 'em in
chains and on the wagon.

16:05.677 --> 16:07.355
Want to know the route,
talk to the marshals.

16:07.379 --> 16:10.491
I will. And it gets cold down by
the riverbank when the sun sets.

16:10.523 --> 16:11.993
Could you scare him up a blanket?

16:12.810 --> 16:14.328
All right, let's wrap up here.

16:15.203 --> 16:16.931
My niece is down from Canada.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.590
She's excited to reunite with
the rest of her family.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.046
Papers?

16:32.079 --> 16:33.575
Yes, sir.

16:35.748 --> 16:37.128
What's your name?

16:37.161 --> 16:38.503
Mary.

16:45.593 --> 16:47.795
Excuse me, you with the broom?

16:47.828 --> 16:49.764
That bed has just been vacated.

16:49.796 --> 16:52.200
Attend to the dirty sheets, please.

17:04.277 --> 17:06.279
Hold him down. Hold him down.

17:06.313 --> 17:08.248
Hold him down. Nurse?

17:08.281 --> 17:09.383
Take my keys.

17:11.618 --> 17:13.621
And get the ether
from the supply closet.

17:13.653 --> 17:16.825
Steady... steady.

17:41.134 --> 17:42.519
Sorry.

18:40.173 --> 18:41.173
Hello.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.108
Can I help you with something?

18:44.245 --> 18:46.447
I'm Elizabeth Hawkes.

18:53.149 --> 18:56.223
A-a friend of a friend sent me?

19:08.415 --> 19:10.371
Frederick Douglass.

19:10.403 --> 19:11.746
Lucretia Mott.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.544
Cassius... Marcellus Clay.

19:16.576 --> 19:17.804
I always have trouble

19:17.838 --> 19:19.546
pronouncing that last one, as well.

19:19.579 --> 19:21.742
I've heard so much about
you and your husband

19:21.776 --> 19:23.403
from Mr. Still's letters.

19:23.436 --> 19:26.621
It's nice to finally put a face
with the name. I'm Georgia.

19:26.653 --> 19:29.056
For a moment there, I thought
I was in the wrong place.

19:29.088 --> 19:30.757
Mr. Still told me the code.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.693
Red cloth for a meeting,
the address is on the card...

19:33.727 --> 19:36.897
And the number of eggs denotes
the time. You got it right.

19:36.930 --> 19:39.400
When you didn't respond to the eggs...

19:39.432 --> 19:41.368
Well, I've just never had anyone

19:41.402 --> 19:44.104
bring them back before,
much less as a snack.

19:44.138 --> 19:46.382
It was thoughtful, and we could always

19:46.414 --> 19:48.142
use the food around here.

19:48.174 --> 19:50.683
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the other ladies.

19:50.717 --> 19:53.314
Arthur believes the rednecks
have gotten word of the rally

19:53.346 --> 19:55.148
and intend to make their presence known.

19:55.181 --> 19:56.416
I welcome their attendance.

19:56.450 --> 19:57.793
Perhaps they will learn something.

19:57.817 --> 19:58.823
- Amen.
- Of course,

19:58.857 --> 20:00.399
there'll be law enforcement
there to keep the peace.

20:00.423 --> 20:02.041
We'll need 'em if
those boys from Lawrence

20:02.065 --> 20:03.491
stampede into town in time.

20:03.525 --> 20:05.227
Well, let us all pray they don't.

20:05.261 --> 20:07.830
Ladies, meet Elizabeth. This is Anne,

20:07.863 --> 20:09.265
Abigail, Sally,

20:09.299 --> 20:11.969
and the one eating all
my award-winning jam is her

20:12.002 --> 20:13.645
- sister Emily.
- It really is fantastic jam.

20:13.669 --> 20:16.138
Hence the award.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.975
So, did everyone bring their kits?

20:18.007 --> 20:19.309
Yes.

20:28.551 --> 20:29.986
Not exactly what you expected?

20:30.020 --> 20:32.022
I didn't know what to expect,

20:32.054 --> 20:33.856
but I did think there
would be some sewing.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.622
We do that, too.

20:35.656 --> 20:38.528
Occasionally.

20:38.561 --> 20:40.830
Welcome to the sewing circle.

21:07.310 --> 21:08.780
Hey, chow time!

22:14.976 --> 22:17.359
You got any idea what you just done?

22:17.392 --> 22:19.361
That plan of yours
was gonna get you killed.

22:19.395 --> 22:20.897
How the hell you know that?

22:20.929 --> 22:22.398
That gate made of cast iron.

22:22.432 --> 22:24.710
Keyhole on the other side.
By the time you pushed it over,

22:24.734 --> 22:27.404
that guard on the other side of
the wall would've shot you down.

22:27.436 --> 22:28.804
What guard?

22:28.838 --> 22:30.906
You see that ash on that window?

22:31.340 --> 22:34.311
He come by every day
right after the slop brought in.

22:34.343 --> 22:36.322
He share one of them cigarettes
with some of the others.

22:36.346 --> 22:38.315
Probably the guy that opens that gate.

22:38.348 --> 22:41.118
Y'all notice he smell like smoke?

22:41.594 --> 22:42.995
Now, maybe if you made
your move at dinnertime,

22:43.019 --> 22:44.630
you'd've got past the gate.
But you'd've ran right

22:44.654 --> 22:46.556
into the marshal's office
across the street.

22:46.589 --> 22:48.792
How you know
where the marshal office is?

22:48.824 --> 22:50.562
You ever hear of the Macon 7?

22:53.763 --> 22:56.002
All the same, why you
care we get ourselves kilt?

22:56.027 --> 22:57.141
I don't.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.237
But if you try and you fail,
you might compromise my escape.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.680
Now, this time tomorrow, all three of us

23:01.704 --> 23:03.639
gonna be put on a transport wagon.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.642
We gonna be pulled
across the Ohio River,

23:05.675 --> 23:08.145
past this rickety bridge,
looks like a devil's grin.

23:08.177 --> 23:10.847
As soon as the sun sets,
the wagon gonna be stopped.

23:10.879 --> 23:12.415
- Stopped by what?
- Spooked horse,

23:12.447 --> 23:13.749
fallen tree. It don't matter.

23:13.782 --> 23:16.285
We just need to be ready
when my friends arrive.

23:16.319 --> 23:19.089
If you trust me, by this time tomorrow,

23:19.121 --> 23:21.290
we gonna all be free men.

23:32.001 --> 23:33.493
Line it up!

23:38.808 --> 23:41.875
Master Roe wants that
western patch cleared.

23:41.907 --> 23:43.879
How long you figure that's gonna take?

23:43.913 --> 23:45.348
I say about three weeks.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.449
Well, I want it in four days!

23:47.483 --> 23:49.615
Got to trench and drench it
in time for the harvest.

23:49.647 --> 23:52.455
A-A lot of trees
in that stretch there, sir.

23:52.919 --> 23:54.356
Twice as much as we been doin',

23:54.711 --> 23:56.724
and we a man down...

23:57.659 --> 24:00.162
- What's that, boy?
- Sorry, sir.

24:00.196 --> 24:02.565
You keep your mouth shut!

24:12.213 --> 24:15.145
The humiliation suffered
by those in bondage is real.

24:15.177 --> 24:16.478
It is raw.

24:16.512 --> 24:18.748
No one is talking about it honestly.

24:18.781 --> 24:21.318
We all just read
a narrative about a man

24:21.350 --> 24:24.521
so badly beaten
he can no longer lift his arms.

24:25.808 --> 24:27.489
Father Henson's Story.

24:27.523 --> 24:29.091
Have you come across it, Elizabeth?

24:29.125 --> 24:30.827
I-I can't say that I have.

24:30.859 --> 24:35.064
Well, it's a harrowing read, but
a necessary tool for the cause.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.366
How so?

24:36.398 --> 24:38.234
Do you know what struck the final blow

24:38.267 --> 24:39.835
against the British slave trade?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.538
It was an article.

24:41.571 --> 24:43.740
"Description of a Slave Ship."

24:43.976 --> 24:46.275
The intolerable image
it conjured in the mind

24:46.309 --> 24:47.944
is what turned the tide overseas.

24:47.976 --> 24:50.679
Well, the best literature
has a way of forcing yourself

24:50.713 --> 24:52.882
into a stranger's skin.
It demands empathy.

24:52.915 --> 24:55.144
- Most-most people don't read.
- That's true.

24:55.177 --> 24:57.553
- They don't.
- And to be honest, even those who do,

24:57.587 --> 24:59.888
given the choice, might be reticent

24:59.921 --> 25:02.758
to steep themselves
in the horrors of slavery.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.561
You make a good point.

25:05.594 --> 25:08.931
It may be time to move past
just the catalog of violence

25:08.965 --> 25:10.500
that most narratives portray.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.301
But the fact remains,

25:12.334 --> 25:14.303
the silence around slavery

25:14.337 --> 25:16.606
is an extension of its brutality.

25:16.638 --> 25:19.109
And we aim to put the issue
into every Northern home

25:19.141 --> 25:21.443
that refuses to see
what's really happening.

25:21.897 --> 25:24.139
Well, the narratives raise awareness.

25:24.173 --> 25:26.116
And the rallies. And the bake sales

25:26.148 --> 25:28.984
to raise funds, and abolitionist
prints like The Liberator.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.786
All forms of disruption.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.223
I have to believe
that a true understanding

25:33.255 --> 25:35.124
of what the Southern Negroes
are enduring

25:35.157 --> 25:37.584
will incite good people to action.

25:42.098 --> 25:44.001
All rise!

25:48.171 --> 25:49.539
You may be seated.

25:52.108 --> 25:54.811
Both the defense and the
prosecution have made some

25:54.843 --> 25:57.013
compelling arguments.
While the murder charges

25:57.045 --> 25:58.685
should be treated
with the utmost respect,

25:59.047 --> 26:01.007
Mr. Hawkes is technically correct.

26:01.324 --> 26:03.893
By federal law, the accused
should be taken back to Georgia.

26:07.045 --> 26:09.191
However, this is my courtroom,

26:09.225 --> 26:11.261
- and I can't abide it.
- Your Honor,

26:11.293 --> 26:14.206
- the Fugitive Slave Act is very clear...
- The accused shot a U.S. marshal

26:14.230 --> 26:16.599
on my side of the river,
after he and his Macon 7

26:16.631 --> 26:17.866
ran up the Eastern Seaboard,

26:17.899 --> 26:20.068
terrorizing law-abiding citizens.

26:20.252 --> 26:21.653
I'd like to file a motion.

26:21.687 --> 26:23.640
No, we're well past motions, Mr. Hawkes.

26:23.673 --> 26:25.550
I will not allow you to waste
any more of this court's time.

26:25.574 --> 26:26.948
As an agent of Ohio law...

26:26.981 --> 26:28.445
Quiet, Mr. Hawkes,

26:28.477 --> 26:29.796
or I will find you in contempt.

26:29.829 --> 26:32.607
As an agent of Ohio law,
I am allowed to file a motion!

26:32.641 --> 26:34.291
As the highest agent of Ohio law,

26:34.323 --> 26:36.151
I am allowed to deny said motion.

26:36.185 --> 26:38.321
This is a miscarriage,
and you know it, Your Honor!

26:38.353 --> 26:39.781
Consider yourself in contempt. Bailiffs.

26:39.805 --> 26:42.125
You cannot ignore federal law!

26:42.157 --> 26:43.292
I just did.

26:43.671 --> 26:45.253
This court has ruled.

26:45.307 --> 26:47.343
The accused is guilty of all charges,

26:47.375 --> 26:48.811
and he will hang for what he did.

26:54.651 --> 26:56.486
You says, "Trust me."

26:56.518 --> 26:58.263
You says you can make the law
work in our favor!

26:58.287 --> 27:00.090
How was I supposed
to know that this judge

27:00.123 --> 27:02.124
would just bypass
the entire legal system?

27:02.158 --> 27:04.227
You open your eyes.

27:04.259 --> 27:05.996
This happen all the time.

27:06.028 --> 27:08.330
In the North, in the South,
it don't matter.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.602
Rules don't apply to black folk.

27:15.470 --> 27:19.142
We have to figure out
a way to save Noah.

27:22.612 --> 27:25.114
Gettin' him sent back ain't work.

27:31.019 --> 27:32.922
You were right.

27:33.989 --> 27:38.116
Ain't no way to steal him
till he outside of them walls.

27:38.578 --> 27:40.696
We'd have to get him at the gallows.

27:40.729 --> 27:43.878
A hanging in the middle
of the city would draw a crowd.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.919
We would need one hell

27:45.952 --> 27:47.166
of a distraction.

27:47.339 --> 27:49.397
Maybe Mary
can help us out there.

27:49.579 --> 27:52.077
He is gonna be guarded until the moment

27:52.110 --> 27:54.713
he is handed to the executioner
on that platform.

27:54.745 --> 27:56.648
We'd have no chance to get him

27:56.681 --> 27:59.202
until that noose was around his neck.

28:01.419 --> 28:03.961
I know some of the workers
who built that gallows.

28:04.008 --> 28:05.373
Maybe they can help.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.587
And once we have him,
then we have to escape with him.

28:09.026 --> 28:11.243
And there's only three of us.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.666
Against every marshal

28:13.698 --> 28:15.551
in that square.

28:15.934 --> 28:18.270
There are more than three of us.

28:18.302 --> 28:20.305
We're part of a movement now.

28:20.613 --> 28:23.211
We can do this.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.945
If any part of this go wrong,
we all end up in jail.

28:26.977 --> 28:29.047
Well, then we're all going to jail.

28:31.748 --> 28:34.485
Yes, and my brother,
he kept on about Canada.

28:34.997 --> 28:36.754
Sayin' there's this town over there.

28:36.787 --> 28:37.922
All black folk.

28:37.956 --> 28:39.091
Yeah, I thought

28:39.123 --> 28:40.591
it was too good to be true.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.261
So now I know.

28:42.293 --> 28:44.095
I'm gonna get over there,
I'm gonna find it.

28:44.129 --> 28:46.098
I heard Canada's a big place.

28:46.130 --> 28:47.498
That's all right.

28:47.532 --> 28:49.268
See, my brother, he a big man.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.803
Well, I'm gonna get on a boat.

28:51.837 --> 28:53.772
Cross that big wide ocean.

28:53.804 --> 28:54.939
What's over there?

28:54.973 --> 28:56.508
A place called France.

28:56.541 --> 28:58.444
Gonna get me a look at that Mona Lisa.

28:59.460 --> 29:02.046
You seen them giant murals massa
have brought in every year.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.149
He brag one 500 years old.

29:05.183 --> 29:07.152
But over there, they 1,000 years old.

29:07.644 --> 29:09.572
I want to see something that old.

29:10.755 --> 29:12.123
How about you?

29:12.157 --> 29:14.126
Where you going when you free?

29:15.291 --> 29:17.228
It don't matter.

29:17.597 --> 29:19.948
Ain't about a place no more.

30:01.372 --> 30:03.574
Let us prosper and be fruitful

30:03.608 --> 30:05.935
in the presence of all good spirits.

30:05.967 --> 30:07.379
- Amen.
- Yes, yes.

30:07.411 --> 30:08.947
Guide us to be faithful and true.

30:10.916 --> 30:12.751
Give we wisdom
for whatever path we want.

30:12.783 --> 30:14.320
Hey!

30:20.550 --> 30:23.195
Your union strengthen all we.

30:23.227 --> 30:24.718
The love we honor

30:24.751 --> 30:27.638
make all we heart gladdy. For truth.

30:27.672 --> 30:28.966
For truth, for truth...

31:25.755 --> 31:27.524
Where you at?

31:31.648 --> 31:33.264
Nowhere.

32:36.759 --> 32:38.892
And this is the one that Tom gave you.

32:40.063 --> 32:42.411
He told me to save it
for a special occasion.

32:42.485 --> 32:44.094
Last time I talked to him.

32:45.388 --> 32:46.672
Which...

32:47.457 --> 32:49.660
felt like the last time.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.391
Even though I didn't know it would be.

32:54.855 --> 32:56.632
He was your brother.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.135
It's okay to miss him.

33:01.871 --> 33:03.039
I tried to draw a line

33:03.073 --> 33:05.039
between family and politics.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.278
But when he hung that man,

33:10.264 --> 33:13.146
Rosalee's brother,
his daughter's brother...

33:13.178 --> 33:14.584
You couldn't do it anymore.

33:14.616 --> 33:15.786
And why should I?

33:16.231 --> 33:17.566
Tom didn't.

33:22.997 --> 33:25.382
The system was built with
the best of intentions,

33:25.415 --> 33:28.754
but those in power have
found ways to corrupt it.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.891
Rosalee's right.

33:32.993 --> 33:35.441
I cannot keep my eyes closed anymore.

33:36.771 --> 33:38.741
John.

33:38.775 --> 33:41.465
Seeing a problem isn't enough.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.042
The system isn't going anywhere.

33:46.476 --> 33:48.185
We have to figure out a way

33:48.218 --> 33:49.968
to disrupt it.

33:51.049 --> 33:52.323
I think that I have.

34:00.376 --> 34:03.104
There is an open seat
on the Court of Commons.

34:03.632 --> 34:04.801
We go down to the courthouse

34:04.834 --> 34:06.672
and we put my name on the ballot.

34:07.607 --> 34:10.908
And then I can start making
rulings that'll help the cause.

34:16.058 --> 34:17.619
What do you think?

34:26.056 --> 34:28.513
I think it's brilliant.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.817
The goddamn ferryman
dumped the crates in the marsh

36:01.850 --> 36:03.285
east of the indigo plantation.

36:03.319 --> 36:05.893
You got to go fish 'em out.

36:06.656 --> 36:08.491
Make sure they ain't
takin' too much of that.

36:08.524 --> 36:10.160
Once I trade 'em, I ain't got no control

36:10.192 --> 36:11.660
over what they do with 'em.

36:14.531 --> 36:15.981
Figure it out.

36:16.351 --> 36:19.561
I want 'em docile, not dead.

36:20.203 --> 36:23.261
You see, this here arrangement, boy,

36:23.705 --> 36:25.510
don't make us friends.

36:26.154 --> 36:27.890
You think about that

36:28.143 --> 36:31.491
next time you feel like talking
out of turn in my fields.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.294
Old buckra.

36:58.740 --> 37:00.610
Sick of rice.

37:02.493 --> 37:03.819
You don't got to eat it.

37:36.317 --> 37:38.453
So this your life now?

37:46.170 --> 37:47.438
Today

37:47.472 --> 37:49.474
the men that stand before you

37:50.360 --> 37:52.784
are guilty of the unspeakable.

37:53.277 --> 37:57.081
They are proven to be a danger
to peace in the state of Ohio,

37:57.114 --> 37:58.782
and society at large.

37:58.815 --> 38:00.752
Only they can know their truth.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.169
Only they can pay for their crimes.

38:03.954 --> 38:05.322
It is our duty

38:05.856 --> 38:09.179
to meet their crimes with retribution.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.039
Citizens will rest at peace tonight

38:11.228 --> 38:12.931
knowing that these murderers

38:12.963 --> 38:16.172
have faced true justice and punishment

38:16.197 --> 38:17.633
for their actions.

38:20.170 --> 38:21.338
Noah Macon,

38:22.406 --> 38:24.341
you have been found guilty as charged

38:24.375 --> 38:25.543
of the crime of murder,

38:26.238 --> 38:29.374
of which the penalty
is death by hanging.

38:30.148 --> 38:32.017
Do you have any last words?

38:42.559 --> 38:43.795
Saul Freeman...

39:22.132 --> 39:26.370
as stipulated by
the laws of the state of Ohio.

39:26.404 --> 39:30.675
Which speaks as clearly today
as it did in the days of old.

39:33.043 --> 39:38.083
Deserves decisive answers.

40:02.773 --> 40:04.108
Noah, get in, get in!

40:07.144 --> 40:09.913
- Noah! Come on!
- Let's go, come on!

40:14.485 --> 40:15.654
Hyah!

40:35.210 --> 40:36.612
They're coming!

40:36.645 --> 40:38.246
How'd they get on us so fast?

40:38.279 --> 40:39.681
They don't look like marshals.

40:58.232 --> 40:59.868
Hyah! Hyah!

41:10.511 --> 41:12.013
Noah!

41:23.424 --> 41:26.681
Death been
followin' you all around.

41:27.161 --> 41:29.518
And you thought you could beat it.

41:30.699 --> 41:32.581
Sacrificed your dignity,

41:32.914 --> 41:34.516
me,

41:34.541 --> 41:35.727
even your children

41:35.752 --> 41:37.878
at the altar of your privilege.

41:39.133 --> 41:41.053
But that the white in you.

41:42.415 --> 41:46.053
The black ain't never
gonna stop huntin' you.

41:47.252 --> 41:48.843
Tried to forget,

41:48.876 --> 41:51.712
and look what forgettin' got you.

41:52.528 --> 41:54.417
Little girl ran away.

41:55.190 --> 41:57.790
Little boy don't belong to you no more.

41:59.221 --> 42:00.455
And Sam...

42:02.342 --> 42:03.342
well...

42:04.445 --> 42:08.396
he swung from the porch of that
big house you thought you owned.

42:09.565 --> 42:12.140
You sad, pretty, little thing.

42:12.533 --> 42:16.165
I bet you told yourself
you was being tough.

42:17.317 --> 42:19.787
All them pieces you cut out to keep on.

42:20.905 --> 42:23.544
But just 'cause you survived,
don't make you strong.

42:23.729 --> 42:26.447
If you was, you'd just do it.

42:29.206 --> 42:30.608
It's what you want, ain't it?

42:31.164 --> 42:32.909
Ever since you hung massa.

42:34.090 --> 42:35.730
When you gave up.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.782
Just do it.

42:37.815 --> 42:39.323
'Cause this,

42:39.370 --> 42:42.407
you sittin' around waitin'
for him to do it for you,

42:42.440 --> 42:43.609
to beat you to death...

42:43.641 --> 42:45.222
this pitiful!

42:49.348 --> 42:51.319
Just kill yourself.

43:00.524 --> 43:01.860
John?

43:04.395 --> 43:05.464
John!

43:13.839 --> 43:15.774
Where's Noah?

43:15.806 --> 43:16.942
Where's Noah?!

43:16.975 --> 43:17.976
They took him.

43:18.009 --> 43:19.178
The marshals?

43:19.210 --> 43:21.350
Those men were not marshals.

44:23.621 --> 44:25.257
John Hawkes!
