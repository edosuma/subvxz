WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:03.169
MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

00:03.211 --> 00:04.462
FOR 7 YEARS, I HAVE FOUGHT
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL--

00:04.504 --> 00:05.964
TO SAVE MY CITY,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.590
BUT NOW A NEW THREAT
HAS EMERGED,

00:07.632 --> 00:09.217
A DANGER SO SEVERE,
IT HAS FORCED ME

00:09.259 --> 00:11.177
TO LEAVE MY FAMILY
IN ORDER TO FACE IT,

00:11.219 --> 00:13.680
AND IT WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR ME
TO JUST BE THE GREEN ARROW.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.348
TO PREVENT THE CRISIS
THAT'S COMING,

00:15.390 --> 00:17.517
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME
SOMEONE ELSE.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.978
I AM GOING TO HAVE
TO BECOME...SOMETHING ELSE.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.689
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

00:22.731 --> 00:24.482
EARTH-2 IS...GONE.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.067
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THAT EARTH WAS

00:26.109 --> 00:27.861
A NECESSARY SACRIFICE.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.989
MAR NOVU IS NOT TRYING TO
PREVENT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:31.031 --> 00:33.033
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA BE
WHAT CAUSES IT.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.577
JOHN DIGGLE IS
MY ADOPTIVE FATHER.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.746
-THANKS, MR. DIGGLES.
-CALL ME DIG.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.331
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT
THE DEATHSTROKES.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.208
[GASPS]

00:42.250 --> 00:44.377
MIA: ZOE!
CONNOR: JJ!

00:47.464 --> 00:48.923
[SOBBING]

00:55.180 --> 00:56.556
DAD?

00:58.808 --> 01:01.561
MIA: DAD?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.480
WILLIAM:
OH, MY GOD. DAD!

01:07.400 --> 01:10.236
W-WILLIAM? WILLIAM?

01:10.278 --> 01:11.946
[WILLIAM CRYING]

01:11.988 --> 01:13.490
HEY.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.539
MIA?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.333
DAD!

01:23.374 --> 01:25.293
WELL, YOU'RE
SO YOUNG.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.879
DAD?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.589
WHAT IS THIS?
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

01:29.631 --> 01:31.508
I--I DON'T KNOW.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.221
THOSE ARE MY KIDS.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.389
DINAH: YOUR KIDS.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.934
ARE YOU--ARE YOU OK?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.977
H-HOW IS THIS REAL?

01:43.019 --> 01:44.938
RENE: GOOD QUESTION.
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,

01:44.979 --> 01:48.149
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN ADULT DAUGHTER
OR ANY DAUGHTER.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.069
WE HAD A DAUGHTER...

01:51.111 --> 01:53.321
AND WE NAMED HER MIA.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.324
FELICITY GAVE BIRTH
A FEW MONTHS AFTER WE
LEFT STAR CITY.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.994
HOW? I--I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.371
OLIVER: WE DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.414
WE WANTED TO KEEP HER
OFF THE GRID

02:03.456 --> 02:05.375
TO PROTECT HER.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.168
THAT WAS ONLY
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

02:09.753 --> 02:11.673
THIS IS NOVU.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.091
YOU CALLED ME DAD.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.051
YOU ADOPTED ME.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.845
REMEMBER?
IT'S CONNOR.

02:16.886 --> 02:22.058
NO. NO. I--I--
I HAVEN'T.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.938
HE HASN'T BECAUSE
HE HASN'T YET.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.524
LOOK. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:29.566 --> 02:31.359
I THINK WE'RE
IN THE PAST.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.903
-THAT IS INSANE.
-LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.197
IT'S NEW,
AND THEM!

02:36.239 --> 02:37.866
NO GRAY HAIR,
NO WRINKLES,

02:37.907 --> 02:41.452
AND WE ARE STARING
AT OUR DAD ALIVE

02:41.494 --> 02:43.329
INSTEAD OF
AT HIS TOMBSTONE.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.331
I'M SORRY.
WHAT YEAR IS THIS?

02:45.373 --> 02:49.752
2-2--UH, IT'S 2019.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.213
WHAT YEAR IS IT
SUPPOSED TO BE?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.673
2040.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.185
JOHN: WAIT. SO AN HOUR AGO,
I WAS JUST WITH BEN TURNER'S
6-YEAR-OLD CHILD,

03:05.226 --> 03:07.103
AND NOW HE'S AN ADULT,
AND NOW I'M HIS FATHER?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.314
AT LEAST YOU
DIDN'T THROW UP
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.815
JUST SAYING.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.900
I'M GENUINELY SORRY
THAT BOTH OF YOU

03:11.941 --> 03:14.027
FOUND OUT THIS WAY,

03:14.068 --> 03:17.947
ABOUT MIA,
ABOUT THE MONITOR.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.866
FELICITY AND I WANTED
TO TELL YOU.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.534
OLIVER, AS FAR
AS EXCUSES GO,

03:21.576 --> 03:23.953
A COSMIC BEING ASKING YOU
TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE

03:23.995 --> 03:27.498
TO SAVE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
IS A...PRETTY GOOD ONE.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.793
LOOK. THOSE KIDS
HAVE 20 YEARS OF
STUFF WE DON'T KNOW.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.962
WHEN ARE WE GONNA
BE ABLE TO ASK THEM
WHAT HAPPENS?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.547
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE
THEM THEIR SPACE,

03:34.589 --> 03:36.925
AND WHEN THEY'RE READY,
THEY'LL OPEN UP.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.260
OK. LAUREL'S ON HER
WAY TO STAR CITY.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.055
DINAH: I CAN'T BELIEVE
HER ENTIRE EARTH
IS JUST GONE.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.515
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DIDN'T THE MONITOR
BRING HER HERE?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.184
OR GROWN-UP JJ
OR ZOE?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.435
WHAT GAME IS
HE PLAYING?

03:47.477 --> 03:50.313
I DON'T KNOW,

03:50.355 --> 03:51.606
BUT WE HAVE
TO STOP HIM.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.317
HOW DO WE STOP
A GOD?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.236
I'M WORKING ON IT.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.614
OK. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.450
WELL, IT IS.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.744
HEY. ARE YOU OK?

04:04.786 --> 04:07.497
I'M FINE. YEAH.
JUST PLEASE TELL ME

04:07.538 --> 04:09.791
THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO GET JJ.

04:09.832 --> 04:14.170
I HAD HIM,
AND I WAS GONNA...KILL HIM,

04:14.212 --> 04:17.632
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M--I'M HERE.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.259
SO HE'S STILL
OUT THERE.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.386
YOU MEAN, OUT THERE
20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE

04:21.427 --> 04:22.971
UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CURRENT JJ,

04:23.012 --> 04:24.430
WHO'D BE, LIKE, WHAT, 5?

04:24.472 --> 04:27.642
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
THWICK HIM.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.103
MIA?

04:30.144 --> 04:32.021
NO, I'M NOT, OK?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.731
HOW DOES THIS
EVEN WORK, ALL RIGHT?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.900
BECAUSE MY DAD DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM,

04:35.942 --> 04:37.777
AND IF HE FINDS OUT
ABOUT JJ, WHAT HE DID,

04:37.819 --> 04:41.489
WHAT I--WHAT I
ALMOST DID,

04:41.531 --> 04:43.032
HE WON'T WANT TO.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.952
SO DON'T TELL HIM.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.037
DON'T TELL
ANYONE ANYTHING.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.540
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-SHE'S RIGHT.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.500
THIS IS ORIGINAL
TEAM ARROW WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.335
THEY ARE GONNA KNOW
SOMETHING'S UP.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.296
DO YOU WANT TO
TELL RENE HIS
DAUGHTER'S DEAD

04:56.337 --> 04:59.632
OR TELL JOHN THAT
HIS SON'S THE ONE
WHO DID IT?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.050
WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

05:07.265 --> 05:11.853
WILLIAM: WOW. THIS PLACE
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DID

05:11.894 --> 05:13.980
WHEN I WAS 13,

05:14.022 --> 05:17.942
WHICH MAKES SENSE
BECAUSE I GUESS
I STILL AM.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.652
SORRY ABOUT
THE BOXES.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.487
FELICITY AND I LEFT
PRETTY SUDDENLY

05:21.529 --> 05:22.905
TO GET
TO THE CABIN,

05:22.947 --> 05:24.782
AND WE
HAD PLANNED TO

05:24.824 --> 05:27.744
COME BACK HERE
WITH BOTH OF YOU
AT SOME POINT.

05:27.785 --> 05:32.248
YEAH. THAT, UM,
DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.625
BECAUSE I DIED?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.586
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.671
YOU JUST SORT OF
DISAPPEARED.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.178
SO DID, UH--LOOKS
LIKE THE TWO OF YOU

05:45.219 --> 05:49.223
GOT A CHANCE TO--
TO GROW UP
WITH EACH OTHER.

05:49.265 --> 05:53.853
UM...ACTUALLY, UM,
MIA AND I

05:53.895 --> 05:56.689
JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT EACH OTHER RECENTLY.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.608
I NEVER SAW FELICITY
GROWING UP,

05:58.649 --> 06:01.694
AND--AND AFTER
I LEFT HERE,

06:01.736 --> 06:03.946
I NEVER SAW YOU AGAIN.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.866
YEAH. AFTER YOU DIED,
IT WAS, UM,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.576
JUST ME AND MOM
AT THE CABIN.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.082
I'M SORRY THAT
I WASN'T THERE
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.042
HOWEVER, WE ARE
HERE NOW.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.586
UM, WHY DON'T WE
SIT DOWN,

06:18.628 --> 06:21.339
AND YOU GUYS CAN
CATCH ME UP
TO SPEED OR--

06:21.381 --> 06:23.633
ON 20 YEARS?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.094
IT DOESN'T REALLY
WORK THAT WAY.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.346
EVEN IF IT DID,
I'M JUST--I'M TIRED.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.891
I WANT TO SLEEP,
AND I--YOU KNOW?

06:31.933 --> 06:36.562
YEP. WELL,
THE BEDROOM IS
RIGHT THERE.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.356
JUST PLEASE MAKE
YOURSELF AT HOME, OK?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.899
YEAH. SURE.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.444
NIGHT.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.786
THIS IS GONNA BE...
INTERESTING.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.162
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.875
FELICITY. SHE NEEDS
TO KNOW THAT

06:57.917 --> 06:59.127
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE BACK.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.129
-YOU CAN'T.
-WHY?

07:01.170 --> 07:04.424
LOOK. I'M NOT EXACTLY
HOW SURE THIS
TIME TRAVEL THING WORKS.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.218
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T...
BRING MOM INTO THIS

07:07.260 --> 07:08.845
UNTIL WE HAVE
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

07:08.886 --> 07:11.431
OF WHAT...THIS IS.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.057
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.186
WILLIAM, TELL ME
SOMETHING GOOD

07:17.228 --> 07:20.022
ABOUT THE FUTURE,
PLEASE.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.526
WELL...YOU KNOW
THOSE COMPUTER PROJECTS

07:23.568 --> 07:25.820
THAT I WOULD WORK ON
IN MY ROOM

07:25.862 --> 07:27.947
WHEN I WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU?

07:27.989 --> 07:30.825
-YEAH.
-I TURNED THAT TEEN ANGST

07:30.867 --> 07:34.912
INTO A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR
TECH EMPIRE.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.956
-WHAT?
-KIND OF A MOGUL.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.251
THAT'S PHENOMENAL.
THAT'S, UM--

07:40.293 --> 07:43.379
I GET THE FEELING
I'M GONNA BE REALLY--

07:43.421 --> 07:47.133
REALLY, REALLY PROUD
OF HOW YOU TURNED OUT.

07:47.175 --> 07:53.848
YEAH. WELL, UM...
I DIDN'T JUST
TURN OUT.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.185
UM...THERE'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD TELL YOU.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.482
I'M GAY.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.030
YEAH, BUDDY.
I KNOW.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.867
-YOU KNOW?
-YEAH.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.577
FELICITY AND I KNEW,

08:14.619 --> 08:17.788
AND WE JUST, UM--

08:17.830 --> 08:21.250
WELL, WE HOPED THAT
YOU WERE GONNA

08:21.292 --> 08:23.794
COME OUT TO US WHEN
YOU WERE COMFORTABLE.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.880
YOU CLEARLY DIDN'T
GET THAT CHANCE,

08:25.922 --> 08:30.927
AND THAT'S ON ME,
SO...I'M SORRY.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.013
DAD, WE ALL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER NOW.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.347
IF YOUR SISTER
WILL LET ME.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.683
MIA WILL COME AROUND.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.144
YOU KNOW, SHE CAN BE
A LITTLE BIT--
A LITTLE BIT STUBBORN

08:40.186 --> 08:43.313
AND...HARD TO REACH
SOMETIMES.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.982
SHOCKER. WHERE'D SHE
GET THAT FROM?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.985
-MOM, I GUESS.
-HA HA HA...

08:55.701 --> 08:58.120
MY HUSBAND
NEEDS HELP.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.039
UM, DID YOU CHECK IN
AT THE DESK?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.750
WE'RE DONORS HERE.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.335
HOLD THIS.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.045
[MOANING]

09:06.087 --> 09:07.755
I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE A LOOK.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.423
[MOANING]

09:09.465 --> 09:11.509
RUN! BOMB!

09:11.551 --> 09:13.094
[BEEPING]

09:29.068 --> 09:30.903
BETHANY SNOW: STARLING GENERAL
WAS ATTACKED LAST NIGHT

09:30.945 --> 09:33.114
AFTER A BOMB WAS FOUND
INSIDE ARCHROYAL CAPITAL CEO

09:33.155 --> 09:34.824
MACMILLAN FAIRFIELD.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE
THE INFAMOUS TERRORIST

09:36.826 --> 09:39.745
DEATHSTROKE ORCHESTRATED
THE ATTACK.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.498
PLEASE TELL ME THE CITY'S
BETTER IN THE FUTURE.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.000
YEAH, YEAH,
DEFINITELY.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.918
-YOU THINK THIS IS SLADE?
-NO. NO, NO.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.295
I HAVE A.R.G.U.S.
KEEPING TABS.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.879
HE'S CURRENTLY
IN BUREDUNIA,

09:48.921 --> 09:50.256
WHICH IS NOWHERE
NEAR STAR CITY.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.674
NEITHER IS HIS SON,
KANE WOLFMAN.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.342
SO THIS IS
SOMEONE NEW?

09:53.384 --> 09:55.219
YEP. SOMEONE HAS CO-OPTED
THE DEATHSTROKE MASK,

09:55.261 --> 09:57.138
AND THEY'RE USING IT
TO TERRORIZE THE CITY.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.015
WE NEED MOTIVE.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.558
WELL, THE VIC
IS SOME RICH
WALL STREET TYPE,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.643
AND THOSE GUYS
ARE EASY TO HATE.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.854
WE'RE NOT ALL BAD.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.772
-HE'S A BILLIONAIRE.
-SAY WHAT?!

10:06.814 --> 10:09.567
PLEASE TELL ME ZOE IS, TOO.
HOW IS ZOE?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.069
I MEAN, ARE YOU GUYS
STILL FRIENDS?

10:12.111 --> 10:16.574
YEAH. SHE'S...
YOU'D BE PROUD.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.951
CURTIS: HEH. HELLO, BUNKER!

10:18.993 --> 10:22.246
OH, IT FEELS SO GOOD TO
BE BACK. WAIT. ARE THOSE
THE KIDS FROM THE FUTURE?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.123
THOSE ARE DEFINITELY
THE KIDS FROM THE FUTURE!

10:24.165 --> 10:25.791
OH, MY GOD, AND EXCUSE ME.
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME

10:25.833 --> 10:27.251
ABOUT THIS, COUNCILMAN RAMIREZ?
THIS IS SO COOL.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.253

20:21.511 --> 20:23.013
WHICH IS HOW HE
SEDUCED JJ.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.598
ANY MORE SPECIFICS?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.433
GRANT'S HOME BASE
JUST GOT BLOWN UP.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.352
THAT--THAT NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.771
WE'RE IN NEW TERRITORY NOW.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.106
HOW LONG TO
ACCESS THE DRIVE?

20:33.148 --> 20:36.818
UH, MORE THAN A FEW,
LESS THAN A YEAR.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.612
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON RENE.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.076
WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE
DOING SOMETHING.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.994
WE WILL BE
ONCE WE KNOW

20:46.036 --> 20:47.913
GRANT WILSON'S PLAN.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.089
ARE YOU CRAZY?
HOW CAN YOU NOT
LIKE MINT CHIP?

20:57.130 --> 20:59.341
IT TASTES LIKE
TOOTHPASTE.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.135
AUNT DINAH? I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.222
HEY, KIDDO.
GIVE ME A SQUEEZE.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.060
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO MY DAD, HUH?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.478
-I'LL GO START SCOOPING.
-HEY, HEY.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.563
DON'T EAT ALL
THE ICE CREAM.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.707
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
WAKE UP EVERY MORNING

21:31.748 --> 21:34.209
KNOWING HOW MANY DAYS
WE HAVE LEFT TOGETHER?

21:35.961 --> 21:39.256
BY TRYING TO CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENS,

21:39.298 --> 21:42.009
TRYING EVERY SINGLE DAY.

21:47.806 --> 21:51.810
WE SHOULD TALK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:51.852 --> 21:53.770
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
BOMB SITE.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.314
MAYBE DINAH
MISSED SOMETHING.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.399
-MIA.
-I'M NOT GONNA STAND AROUND

21:57.441 --> 21:58.942
AND WASTE TIME.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.652
LOOK. I KNOW WHAT'S
DRIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.321
YOU LOST A TEAMMATE.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.697
I--I--I'VE BEEN THERE.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.532
I--I CAN HELP.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.868
YOU KNOW, I SURVIVED
MY WHOLE LIFE
WITHOUT YOU.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.619
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO PLAY DAD NOW.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.788
HEY. I'M NOT PLAYING DAD.
I AM SIMPLY TELLING YOU

22:11.830 --> 22:13.582
THAT IT IS NOT
TACTICALLY WISE
TO GO OUT THERE

22:13.623 --> 22:14.875
BY YOURSELF...

22:14.916 --> 22:16.168
FINE. I'LL TAKE LAUREL.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.502
WHEN YOU ARE LETTING
YOUR DECISIONS

22:17.544 --> 22:19.629
BE DRIVEN
BY YOUR EMOTIONS.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.298
TRUST ME. I'VE BEEN THERE.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.883
YOU DON'T GET A SAY.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.259
YOU GAVE UP THAT RIGHT
WHEN YOU LEFT

22:24.301 --> 22:27.929
ME AND MOM ALONE
IN THAT CABIN.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.681
HOW COULD YOU JUST
ABANDON US?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.391
BECAUSE I CHOSE TO
KEEP YOU SAFE,
AND I CHOSE RIGHT.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.518
YOU JUST WANTED
TO BE A HERO,

22:33.560 --> 22:37.522
SO YOU PUT YOUR MISSION
ABOVE YOUR FAMILY.

22:37.564 --> 22:41.860
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL
LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT
ME PRETTY EASY

22:41.902 --> 22:43.653
JUST LIKE I LEARNED
TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.239
AHEM.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.742
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO
OUT THERE.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.578
NYSSA AL GHUL
TRAINED ME.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.163
YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW WELL?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.831
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU.
I'M YOUR FATHER.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.875
REALLY? BECAUSE
FROM WHERE I STAND,

22:56.917 --> 22:58.710
YOU'RE JUST SOME GUY
IN MY WAY.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.339
LAUREL: MIA...

23:04.758 --> 23:06.468
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.725
LET'S GO.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.110
UH...DAD, I KNOW
THIS IS BAD TIMING,

23:23.151 --> 23:24.486
BUT YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.904
IT'S LIVE.

23:28.448 --> 23:32.327
GRANT: 6 YEARS AGO,
MY FATHER RAINED TERROR
DOWN ON THIS CITY.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.038
HE WAS SHORT-SIGHTED, FOOLISH.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.040
THIS CITY HAS A CANCER,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.709
THE 1% WHO CONTROL INDUSTRY.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.212
I WILL EXCISE IT.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.924
OUR SIEGE OF STAR CITY
BEGINS TONIGHT.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.844
WILLIAM: THIS MIGHT BE
HOW IT STARTS.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.929
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE FUTURE.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.227
WHY WOULD GRANT GIVE
US ADVANCE WARNING?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.520
IT SEEMS TOO EASY.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.063
THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.690
LOOK. GRANT MAY BE
PLANNING AN ATTACK,

24:01.731 --> 24:03.567
BUT IT WON'T BE
ON THE RICH.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.318
THAT VIDEO'S A MISLEAD.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.697
THIS KIND OF DECEPTION IS
A DEATHSTROKE SPECIAL.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.240
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.950
I WAS UNDERCOVER
WITH THEM FOR A WHILE,

24:11.992 --> 24:14.703
A LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT
TO GET THROUGH TO JJ.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.998
OK. SO IF THIS IS
A BAIT AND SWITCH,
WHAT'S THE SWITCH?

24:18.039 --> 24:19.458
WHAT DO YOU THINK
GRANT'S PLANNING.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.209
SOMETHING
A WHOLE LOT BIGGER.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.170
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT EXACTLY.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.255
EVERYTHING HAPPENING
WITH THE DEATHSTROKES

24:25.297 --> 24:27.090
IS DIFFERENT NOW.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.633
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME
GOOD NEWS.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.677
I MANAGED TO EXTRACT
THE DATA FROM THE DRIVE,

24:30.719 --> 24:32.596
BUT, SURPRISE, SURPRISE,
IT'S ENCRYPTED,

24:32.637 --> 24:34.264
AND SINCE I'M NOT
AN EXPERT

24:34.306 --> 24:36.057
IN EARLY 21ST-CENTURY
DECRYPTION ALGORITHMS,

24:36.099 --> 24:38.935
I'VE CALLED IN
SOMEONE WHO IS--CURTIS.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.896
GREAT. NOW WHAT ABOUT
MIA AND LAUREL?

24:40.937 --> 24:43.106
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON TRACKING
DOWN GRANT.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.650
FELICITY'S SEARCH
ALGORITHM SHOULD STILL
BE ON THE COMPUTER.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.319
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.945
WOW. MOM REALLY LIKED
PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE

24:48.987 --> 24:50.947
WITH
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, HUH?

24:50.989 --> 24:53.283
YEAH.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.285
ANY CHATTER
FROM A.R.G.U.S.?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.704
NO. NO, NO, NO.
THEY SAID THEY'LL
KEEP US POSTED.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.292
HEY. I SPOKE
TO RENE, BY THE WAY.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.711
WELL, I'M QUITE SURE
HE'S NOT WILLING
TO TALK TO ME.

25:04.753 --> 25:08.340
NO, BUT I DO KNOW
SOMEONE WHO IS.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.762
[JOHN SIGHS]

25:16.806 --> 25:19.100
ARE YOU AVOIDING HIM?

25:19.142 --> 25:20.435
NO.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.069
[SIGHS]

25:29.110 --> 25:30.570
MAYBE.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.534
I'VE NEVER DEALT
WITH ANYTHING LIKE
THIS BEFORE.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.953
MY HEAD IS STILL
SPINNING.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.830
I--I--I WANT
TO BLAME SOMEONE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO.

25:42.999 --> 25:46.044
JOHN, WE ALL FAILED
TO SAVE THIS CITY.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.588
YEAH, DINAH,
BUT I'M HIS FATHER,

25:48.630 --> 25:50.465
SO IT'S ON ME.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.509
SO YOU DID PICK
WHO TO BLAME.

25:56.096 --> 25:59.683
ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT JJ GOT ME

25:59.724 --> 26:03.019
THINKING ABOUT ANDY,
HOW I FAILED HIM,

26:03.061 --> 26:07.524
SO YEAH, THE BLAME IS
DEFINITELY ON ME.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.235
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE SAME THING
I TOLD RENE

26:10.277 --> 26:13.989
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME
THING I'VE BEEN
TELLING MYSELF.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.074
KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENED

26:16.116 --> 26:20.662
CAN EITHER DESTROY US
OR SAVE US.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.248
WE'VE SEEN OUR WORST.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.667
NOW LET'S BE OUR BEST.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.798
LAUREL: IN THE FUTURE,
DO THEY STILL USE

26:31.840 --> 26:34.426
THE PHRASE
"WILD GOOSE CHASE"?

26:34.467 --> 26:35.885
IF YOU'RE BORED,
YOU CAN GO.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.304
I DON'T NEED
A BABYSITTER.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.889
NO, BUT YOU MIGHT
NEED BACKUP

26:39.931 --> 26:42.142
WHEN YOU TRY AND KILL
GRANT WILSON.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.521
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

26:46.563 --> 26:49.399
OH. WELL, CLEARLY
NO ONE HAS INFORMED YOU

26:49.441 --> 26:51.901
THAT I USED TO PLAY
FOR TEAM VILLAIN,

26:51.943 --> 26:55.822
AND I CAN SPOT
A MURDEROUS INTENT
A MILLION MILES AWAY.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.283
SO WHAT, ARE YOU
GONNA TRY AND TALK
ME OUT OF IT NOW,

26:58.325 --> 27:00.327
TELL ME TO LISTEN
TO MY DAD OR--

27:00.368 --> 27:04.706
OH, GOD, NO. I WOULD
NEVER TELL ANY ONE
TO LISTEN TO OLIVER QUEEN.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.541
NO OFFENSE,

27:06.583 --> 27:10.337
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY
A VERY BIG FAN
OF YOUR FATHER'S.

27:10.378 --> 27:14.049
HE'S KIND OF A DICK,
BUT YOU ARE A GROWN WOMAN,

27:14.090 --> 27:18.637
AND IF YOU WANT TO
KILL THIS GUY,
THEN HAVE AT IT,

27:18.678 --> 27:21.097
BUT I JUST WANT TO
KNOW WHY.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.017
BECAUSE LOCKING HIM
UP ISN'T GONNA
CHANGE ANYTHING.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.436
HE ESCAPES
EVERY TIME.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.647
IT'S WHY HE IS
SUCH A CULT HERO

27:28.688 --> 27:30.565
AMONG ALL THE WORST
HERE IN STAR CITY.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.985
-INCLUDING FUTURE JJ.
-EXACTLY.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.113
LOOK. GRANT HAS TO DIE
SO ZOE CAN LIVE.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.157
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CHANGING TIMELINES,

27:39.199 --> 27:42.369
BUT I AM SOMETHING
OF AN EXPERT ON VENGEANCE,

27:42.410 --> 27:45.705
AND GETTING IT,
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

27:45.747 --> 27:47.957
BUT CAUSE YOU MORE PAIN.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.085
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE
AN EXPERT ON TALKING
PEOPLE OUT OF MURDER?

27:50.126 --> 27:52.003
KIND OF.

27:52.045 --> 27:56.549
I HAD TO WHEN FELICITY
WANTED TO TAKE DOWN
RICARDO DIAZ.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.176
MY MOM TRIED
TO KILL SOMEONE?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.720
NO, BECAUSE I TALKED HER
OUT OF IT.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.055
AND, LOOK, I GET IT.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.224
YOU AND YOUR MOM,
YOU'RE BOTH WOMEN

28:04.265 --> 28:06.101
WHO WON'T ALLOW THEMSELVES
TO BE TALKED OUT OF ANYTHING,

28:06.142 --> 28:09.229
AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

28:09.270 --> 28:15.026
BUT FELICITY, SHE NEVER
REGRETTED CHANGING
HER APPROACH,

28:15.068 --> 28:18.321
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY DOING
THINGS DIFFERENTLY, TOO.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.037
[SIGHS]

28:31.376 --> 28:33.503
THERE YOU ARE.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.255
MIA'S BACK.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.508
YOU CRACK THE DRIVE?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.593
CURTIS ALMOST
HAS IT.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.303
GOD, YOU KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF ANNOYING
HOW GOOD HE IS.

28:42.345 --> 28:46.725
PLUS HE'S GOT THIS
PERFECT HUSBAND/LIFE,

28:46.766 --> 28:49.978
NOT THAT I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.567
LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S
DONE, OK?

28:55.608 --> 28:58.445
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN TOLD
BY SEVERAL EX-BOYFRIENDS

28:58.486 --> 29:01.406
THAT I DO THIS
MOODY, BROODY THING

29:01.448 --> 29:03.950
WHEN I'M PROBLEM-SOLVING.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.453
GUESS IT MUST BE
GENETIC.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.079
IT'S MIA, RIGHT?

29:08.121 --> 29:10.248
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GO OUT THERE.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.041
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
HAVE MADE HER STAY?

29:12.083 --> 29:14.043
WHAT, PUT HER
IN TIMEOUT?
SHE'S AN ADULT.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.004
YEAH, AND LIKE AN ADULT,
SHE MAKES MISTAKES.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.298
LOOK. SHE'S RIGHT.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.301
I CHOSE TO GO
WITH THE MONITOR.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.928
I ABANDONED HER.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.889
I HAVEN'T EARNED
A SAY.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.558
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN SHE DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO HAVE ONE

29:28.600 --> 29:31.519
OR--OR THAT YOU SHOULDN'T,

29:31.561 --> 29:35.356
AND I'M SAYING THAT
FROM EXPERIENCE.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.858
YOU HAVE KIDS
IN THE FUTURE?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.735
OH, GOD, NO.
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.779
KIDS ARE A MIRACLE
OR...WHATEVER,

29:40.820 --> 29:43.448
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
REFERRING TO

29:43.490 --> 29:46.534
WHEN I LEFT YOU TO GO
LIVE WITH GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.870
YEAH. THAT ONE'S
STILL PRETTY FRESH
FOR ME.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.330
RIGHT.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.207
I--I--I...

29:52.248 --> 29:54.000
I THOUGHT YOU
HATED MY GUTS.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.002
I HATED YOU
FOR ABANDONING ME.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.879
-I TRIED.
-TRUE,

29:57.921 --> 30:01.257
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO TRY HARDER,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.384
PUSH A LITTLE MORE.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.137
I THINK THAT'S ALL
ANY CHILD WANTS
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

30:10.683 --> 30:13.144
I'M SORRY.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.064
IT'S OK.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.275
DAD, I AM GLAD THAT
YOU'RE IN MY LIFE

30:19.317 --> 30:24.072
THEN AND NOW,

30:24.113 --> 30:25.782
AND MIA WILL BE, TOO.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.621
UM, I HATE TO
INTERRUPT FATHER-SON TIME,

30:31.663 --> 30:34.165
BUT WE GOT SOMETHING.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.668
SO GRANT IS TRYING TO
ONE-UP HIS FATHER.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.545
THE SIEGE VERSION 2.0
IS TONIGHT,

30:38.586 --> 30:40.171
AND THIS TIME,
MIRAKURU IS OUT,

30:40.213 --> 30:41.881
AND COORDINATED
BOMB ATTACKS ARE IN.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.050
OLIVER: HOW MANY?
LAUREL: LOTS,

30:44.092 --> 30:47.053
AND GRANT HAS THEM
ALL CONNECTED TO
A REMOTE DETONATOR,

30:47.095 --> 30:48.596
PROBABLY A PHONE.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.807
THE GOOD NEWS IS--
AND USE THAT TERM

30:50.849 --> 30:54.894
VERY LOOSELY--IS THAT
HE SET UP A RELAY DEVICE
UNDERNEATH DOWNTOWN.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.313
SO WE DISABLE
THE RELAY DEVICE,
WE TURN OFF THE BOMB.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.648
MIA: OK. WHAT ABOUT GRANT?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.149
