WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.878
- LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.846
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.683
I'M A REVIEWER, BUT I DON'T
REVIEW FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.685
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.020
VIVA LA REVOLUCION!

00:20.054 --> 00:23.224
[cheering]

00:23.257 --> 00:25.659
[taser crackling]
AAH! AAH!

00:25.693 --> 00:28.662
[fanfare music]

00:28.696 --> 00:33.167
*

00:33.201 --> 00:35.002
WELCOME TO REVIEW.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.571
I'M FORREST MACNEIL, PERFORMING
AN IMPORTANT SERVICE TO SOCIETY

00:37.605 --> 00:39.707
BY REVIEWING LIFE EXPERIENCES.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.776
AND I AM ABLY ASSISTED,
AS ALWAYS, BY A.J. GIBBS.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.178
- HI, FORREST.
- HI.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.913
LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT, SHALL WE?
- YES!

00:45.946 --> 00:47.515
- WHAT'S MY FIRST REVIEW?
- ALL RIGHT, FORREST.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.949
THIS NEXT QUESTION COMES TO US

00:48.982 --> 00:51.685
FROM OLIVIA, IN SWARTHMORE,
PENNSYLVANIA.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.954
- MY BOYFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN
DATING FOR SEVEN YEARS,

00:53.987 --> 00:55.956
AND HE'S STILL NOT READY
TO GET MARRIED.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.425
BUT I DON'T GET WHY
IT'S TAKING SO LONG.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.360
I MEAN, IF YOU'VE FOUND
THE RIGHT PERSON,

00:59.393 --> 01:03.964
WOULDN'T IT BE JUST AS GOOD TO
MARRY THEM THE DAY YOU MET THEM?

01:03.997 --> 01:06.434
- OH, MY GOD, FORREST,
ARE YOU GONNA MARRY SOMEONE?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.602
- UH, YES.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.037
- I THINK I'M GONNA CRY.
- REALLY?

01:10.138 --> 01:11.305
- OH, YEAH,
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU,

01:11.339 --> 01:12.940
'CAUSE YOU SEEM LONELY.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.675
- I SEEM LONELY BECAUSE
I AM, YES.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.444
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M INCREDIBLY LONELY.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.045
- YEAH.
- SO, YEAH.

01:18.146 --> 01:22.616
TO THIS REVIEW, I SAY, "I DO."

01:22.650 --> 01:25.819
HANDSOME, ATHLETIC,
AND COMPLETELY NORMAL

01:25.853 --> 01:28.889
MEDIA PROFESSIONAL
SEEKS WIFE TODAY.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.192
I HADN'T TRIED TO REENTER
THE DATING POOL

01:31.225 --> 01:33.194
SINCE DIVORCING MY WIFE,
SUZANNE.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.729
WAS I ABOUT TO FIND A WOMAN
WHO WOULD MAKE ME

01:35.763 --> 01:38.399
FORGET ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF
MY FIRST MARRIAGE?

01:38.432 --> 01:41.235
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE, BUT I WAS
WILLING TO BE PROVEN WRONG.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.305
WITH A PINK CARNATION IN
MY LAPEL,

01:44.338 --> 01:48.876
I WILL BE PREPARED TO MARRY
THE FIRST WOMAN WHO JOINS ME.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.679
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EXCITEMENT
I FELT AS I WAITED

01:51.712 --> 01:55.316
FOR MY NEW WIFE
TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

01:55.349 --> 01:59.187
BUT AS 6:00 BECAME 7:00...

01:59.187 --> 02:01.589
AND THEN 7:30,

02:01.622 --> 02:03.724
I BEGAN TO CONSIDER
DIFFERENT APPROACHES,

02:03.757 --> 02:07.461
SUCH AS TARGETING UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANTS OR CLOSETED LESBIANS.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.631
AND THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.235
- [sighs]
THANK GOD, YOU'RE STILL HERE.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.937
- OH, MY GOD.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.273
UH, YES, HELLO.
- HELLO.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.074
- UH--[laughs]

02:21.108 --> 02:22.210
I'M--I'M FORREST.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.245
- HI, I'M ELIZA.
- ELIZA.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.846
WOW, OKAY.
- WOW.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.748
- UH, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.417
- THANK YOU. [laughs]
- OKAY.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.320
ELIZA EXUDED A SENSE OF WONDER
ABOUT THE WORLD

02:32.353 --> 02:34.288
THAT WAS POSITIVELY INFECTIOUS.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.824
- IT'S GONNA SOUND CRAZY,
BUT I FEEL LIKE

02:36.857 --> 02:39.927
THE HAND OF THE UNIVERSE IS
ALWAYS GUIDING US IN WAYS THAT

02:39.960 --> 02:42.129
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.
- HUH.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.598
- AND ALL WE CAN DO
IS JUST NOT FIGHT IT.

02:44.632 --> 02:48.101
- I HAD NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE
HER BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.503
- AMAZING.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.873
SO I'M NOT A BIG DREAM PERSON...
- HMM.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.775
- BUT I DO HAVE
THIS RECURRING DREAM THAT

02:54.808 --> 02:56.143
I LIVE ON A SUBMARINE.
- [chuckles]

02:56.244 --> 02:57.545
- IT'S--I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.513
BUT IT'S--IT'S A DREAM.
- YEAH.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.416
- SO, I WAS ON THE INTERNET
TODAY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:02.450 --> 03:04.418
IF I COULD MAYBE VISIT
ONE SOMETIME,

03:04.452 --> 03:06.086
JUST FOR FUN.
- MM-HMM.

03:06.119 --> 03:10.123
- AND THEN, A FEW CLICKS LATER,
I'M STARING AT YOUR AD.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.760
- [clicks tongue] WOW.
- I FEEL LIKE, WHEN TWO PEOPLE

03:12.793 --> 03:14.962
ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER...
- MM.

03:14.995 --> 03:19.267
- THE UNIVERSE JUST FINDS A WAY
FOR THEM TO FIND EACH OTHER.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.534
- YEAH.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.769
- MAYBE THIS IS WRITTEN
IN THE STARS.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.872
- IN THE STARS?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.307
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.775
- [laughs]

03:27.808 --> 03:29.677
- 'CAUSE STARS ARE KIND OF
MY THING.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.945
[both chuckling]

03:31.979 --> 03:33.814
THIS IS GONNA SEEM CRAZY...

03:33.847 --> 03:35.616
WHEN ELIZA FIRST SAT DOWN,

03:35.649 --> 03:39.320
I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO MARRY HER
TO DO THE REVIEW I HAD GOTTEN.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.556
NOW, TO MY ASTONISHMENT,
I REALIZED

03:42.590 --> 03:46.794
I NEEDED TO GET THIS REVIEW IN
ORDER TO MEET AND MARRY ELIZA.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.163
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

03:50.197 --> 03:51.565
- YES.
- YES?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.401
- YES!
- YOU WILL?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.436
[laughs]
- YES. YES! [laughs]

03:57.971 --> 04:01.074
- WELL, LET'S--
- [sighs]

04:01.108 --> 04:03.477
- YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.847
- AND JUST LIKE THAT,
MY LONELINESS WAS OVER.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.151
FOR THE SECOND AND LAST TIME,
I HAD FOUND MY SOUL MATE.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.853
[all talking]

04:12.886 --> 04:14.988
THIS IS AMAZING!
[laughter]

04:15.022 --> 04:16.424
COME ON.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.328
LET'S FIND A PLACE TO HAVE
A HONEYMOON.

04:20.328 --> 04:24.197
ELIZA AND I WASTED NO TIME
STARTING OUR NEW LIVES TOGETHER.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.400
WE MOVED INTO HER HOUSE,
A MANSION THAT SHE SHARED

04:26.434 --> 04:27.901
WITH SEVERAL FREE-SPIRITED
HOUSEMATES.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.070
- TAYLOR AND SARAH, HI!
- HELLO.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.440
- TOBY.
HE USED TO BE MY KID.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.208
- THAT'S A CHILD--"USED TO BE"?
- HI, GUYS. [laughs]

04:35.242 --> 04:37.010
THIS IS THE SEX TRUCK.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.779
- I'M SORRY, THIS IS
THE SEX TRUCK?

04:38.812 --> 04:41.048
- DR. ERICSON!

04:41.081 --> 04:43.717
- EVERYONE HERE SEEMED
TO HAVE SIGNED ON TO A LIFE

04:43.751 --> 04:45.753
LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.122
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT THESE WERE MY PEOPLE.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.124
[laughter]
OH, MY.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.961
- I GOT MARRIED!
[laughter]

04:53.994 --> 04:56.464
- OH, YEAH.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.798
- PRETTY BIG NEWS.
- YEAH.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.134
- MAZEL TOV, MAN.
- I SMELL LENTILS.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.371
- THERE WAS A FIRE IN YOUR ROOM.
- FIRE?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.439
- YOUR STUFF'S OUT IN THE YURT.
- COOL.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.140
- OH, STUFF'S OUT IN THE YURT.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.542
GREAT.
SURE.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.210
LOOK AT THAT.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE I FOUND

05:10.243 --> 05:13.213
THIS STUFF ON THE STREET?
- YES, I CAN.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.615
[dog barking]

05:14.648 --> 05:16.784
AS WE SETTLED IN
TO OUR NEW LIFE TOGETHER,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.388
I WAS FILLED WITH A SENSE
OF ANTICIPATION FOR THE FUTURE

05:20.388 --> 05:22.390
I HADN'T FELT SINCE MY YOUTH.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.133
- [sighs]

05:33.166 --> 05:36.737
- OH, UM...

05:36.770 --> 05:39.673
- [sighs]

05:39.707 --> 05:41.575
- SWEETHEART?

05:41.609 --> 05:44.177
- [snores]

05:44.211 --> 05:46.914
- THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR
SPOUSE WHEN YOU GET MARRIED,

05:46.947 --> 05:49.550
THE MORE WONDERFUL SURPRISES
REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED

05:49.583 --> 05:51.084
AS YOU BUILD A LIFE TOGETHER.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.421
UH, BUT BEFORE WE GO
ANY FURTHER,

05:53.421 --> 05:55.322
I WANT TO BRING YOU--
WILL YOU COME OUT HERE, PLEASE?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.857
COME ON OUT.
- OKAY.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.592
- YES, COME UP ON STAGE.
I WANT YOU HERE FOR THIS.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.160
A.J...
- OH.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.462
- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET
MRS. ELIZA MACNEIL.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.896
- HELLO. [laughs]
- OH, HI.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.164
- AM I YOUR CO-HOST
OR SOMETHING?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.435
- [laughs]

06:07.468 --> 06:08.669
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WITH THIS.
- OKAY.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.170
- WILL YOU DO THIS WITH ME?
- YEAH.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.839

06:15.843 --> 06:18.011
both: FIVE STARS!

06:18.045 --> 06:20.581
[laughter]

06:20.614 --> 06:22.282
- FIVE STARS.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.817
- AND I GIVE FIVE STARS
TO NOTHING.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.852
- [laughs]
- I MEAN, I'VE HARDLY GIVEN

06:24.885 --> 06:25.853
FIVE STARS TO ANYTHING,
SERIOUSLY.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.887
- YOU!
[laughter]

06:30.157 --> 06:33.794
[fanfare music]

06:33.827 --> 06:35.696
- WHAT A GLORIOUS SHOW THIS IS.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.798
WHAT A GLORIOUS LIFE!
- HMM.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.100
- I CANNOT WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHAT MY NEXT REVIEW IS.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.702
GO, A.J.
DO IT, DO IT.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.370
- OUR NEXT REVIEW COMES TO US

06:43.471 --> 06:46.306
FROM PRESCOTT IN BATON ROUGE--

06:46.339 --> 06:48.576
- LOUISIANA!
[laughs]

06:48.609 --> 06:49.777
- THAT'S RIGHT.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.311
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- YEP.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.146
GOOD POINT.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

06:53.180 --> 06:59.152
HE WRITES...

06:59.186 --> 07:00.654
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
WOW.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.190
"WHAT IS IT LIKE TO RUN FROM
THE LAW"?

07:03.223 --> 07:05.058
[scoffs, laughs]

07:05.092 --> 07:06.694
WOW, OKAY.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.562
I GUESS I'M ABOUT TO GO
ON THE RUN.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.064
- I GUESS WE'RE ABOUT TO GO
ON THE RUN.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.200
- WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.002
- SURE, I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING
TOGETHER FROM NOW ON.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.070
- MY GOD.
ALL RIGHT.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.706
[kiss]

07:18.739 --> 07:20.574
- TRY NOT TO GET SHOT!

07:20.608 --> 07:21.975
both: THANK YOU!
- YEAH.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.244
[laughter]
NO PROBLEM.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.747
- OH.
- LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.516
- TOLD YOU.
COPS LOVE THIS PLACE.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.150
- LET'S DO THIS.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.354
- [laughs]
[both moan]

07:34.387 --> 07:36.957
- YOU'RE AMAZING.
- YOU'RE AMAZING.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.162
HERE WE GO.
- GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.098
- OH, BOY.
OKAY.

07:45.132 --> 07:49.102
THE PLAN IS THAT I'M GONNA THROW
THIS BRICK THROUGH THE WINDOW

07:49.136 --> 07:50.704
AT THOSE POLICE OFFICERS.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.405
THIS OUGHT TO GET
THEIR BLOOD BOILING.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.842
NOW, THE IDEA OF COMMITTING
AN ACT AGAINST THE POLICE

07:54.875 --> 07:56.944
IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.945
[gunshot]

07:57.978 --> 07:59.547
OOH!
[all screaming]

07:59.547 --> 08:01.181
- ALL RIGHT, ANYBODY MOVE
AND THIS COP DIES!

08:01.214 --> 08:02.983
- NO!
- LET'S GO.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.284
- ELIZA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.553
GET IN THE CAR.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:05.553 --> 08:07.020
- GET IN THE CAR!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

08:07.054 --> 08:09.122
- GET IN THE CAR!
- WHERE ARE WE TAKING THIS MAN?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.423
- WE'RE KIDNAPPING THIS GUY!

08:10.457 --> 08:12.560
- NO!
I WAS JUST GONNA THROW A BRICK!

08:12.560 --> 08:13.761
[sirens approaching]
- GET IN THERE!

08:13.794 --> 08:14.962
- ALL RIGHT.
- GET IN THE CAR!

08:14.995 --> 08:15.963
- OKAY.
- I SWEAR TO [bleep] GOD,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.364
I WANT TO KILL YOU!

08:17.397 --> 08:19.432
I WOULD LOVE TO KILL YOU!

08:19.466 --> 08:20.634
GET IN, GET IN!
- OH, GOD.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.169
WHAT DO I DO WITH THE BRICK?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.170
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
THE BRICK--OH!

08:23.203 --> 08:24.471
- GO!

08:24.572 --> 08:25.472
DRIVE! DRIVE!
- WE HAD A PLAN!

08:25.573 --> 08:27.340
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD PLAN!

08:27.374 --> 08:28.809
- NOBODY'S GONNA CHASE US IF YOU
THROW A BRICK THROUGH A WINDOW.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.477
- OH, GOD.
DON'T SHOOT US!

08:30.578 --> 08:32.345
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD.
- STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!

08:32.379 --> 08:35.215
- SO FAR, BEING ON THE RUN IS
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.185
DON'T DO IT!
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.053
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.655
ALTHOUGH I WAS
AT FIRST CONCERNED

08:41.689 --> 08:43.190
WITH HER ZEALOUSNESS...

08:43.223 --> 08:45.125
SWITCHING CARS.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.861
ELIZA'S HELP IN EXECUTING THIS
REVIEW WAS PROVING INVALUABLE.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.897
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SETTING THIS CAR ON FIRE!

08:49.930 --> 08:51.298
- THAT'S JUST SELTZER WATER.
HEY, HEY, HEY!

08:51.331 --> 08:52.800
- THEN HELP ME...
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

08:52.833 --> 08:53.967
HE'S RUNNING AWAY!
- DESTROY THE EVIDENCE.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.035
- WHERE DID YOU GO?
HEY!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.036
WHERE DID YOU GO?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.037
I DON'T KNOW.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.038
DID YOU SEE WHERE HE WENT?

08:58.071 --> 08:59.607
HEY, HEY, HEY!

08:59.607 --> 09:01.141
- WHERE IS HE?
- HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.375
HE'S HERE. HEY, STOP IT!
- [shouting]

09:02.409 --> 09:03.443
- GET BACK HERE!
- I SWEAR TO GOD,

09:03.476 --> 09:05.112
I WILL KILL YOU.
- HEY, STOP IT!

09:05.145 --> 09:06.814
- I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL KILL YOU!
- STOP, STOP, JUST STOP.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.415
CAN YOU PUT THE GUN DOWN PLEASE?
- OKAY, YOU THINK THIS IS

09:08.448 --> 09:10.217
THE FIRST TIME I'VE KIDNAPPED
A COP BEFORE?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.985
- OKAY, NOPE--WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M MRS. FORREST MACNEIL!

09:12.019 --> 09:14.121
NOW GET IN THE CAR!
[bleep] AMATEURS!

09:14.154 --> 09:16.156
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST GO.
[engine revs]

09:16.189 --> 09:18.191
YOU'RE IN NEUTRAL.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.294
- OKAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS,

09:21.328 --> 09:24.064
SENDING THIS TAPE TO THE POLICE
AND ASKING FOR A RANSOM?

09:24.097 --> 09:27.300
- WHAT?
WE DON'T WANT MONEY.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.802
WE JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE

09:28.836 --> 09:30.470
TO BE ON THE RUN FROM THE COPS.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.505
- LIKE A BONNIE AND CLYDE
KIND OF THING?

09:32.539 --> 09:35.308
- YOU THINK THIS IS A MOVIE?
THIS IS REAL LIFE.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.443
- BONNIE AND CLYDE WERE
REAL PEOPLE, ACTUALLY.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.146
- YES, BUT IT'S A MOVIE FIRST.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.115
- NO, IT WAS REAL PEOPLE FIRST.
- SHUT UP!

09:42.149 --> 09:44.451
- FEELINGS OF INTENSE FEAR
AND PARANOIA

09:44.484 --> 09:46.486
SEEMED TO BE CLOUDING
OUR JUDGMENT.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.956
[water running]

09:48.989 --> 09:51.258
- OKAY.
- [sighs]

09:51.291 --> 09:53.927
- OKAY, GREAT.
NOW CHANGE CLOTHES.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.096
- I--WHY--I-I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS,

09:56.129 --> 09:57.497
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
- SWEETIE,

09:57.530 --> 09:58.966
THE COPS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR A GUY

09:58.999 --> 10:00.333
THAT LOOKS LIKE IGOR DID
THIS MORNING.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.202
- RIGHT.
IGOR?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.203
- THAT'S HIS NAME.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.371
- OKAY.
- HELLO.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.372
- AND PUT THE MOUSTACHE ON.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.774
I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.809
- NONE OF THIS MAKE SENSE,
BUT FINE, OKAY.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.947
I WAS PREPARED FOR THIS REVIEW
TO BE FULL

10:13.981 --> 10:16.216
OF UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.451
SOME FRIGHTENING, SOME EXCITING.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.954
BUT THE TWISTS OF THIS DAY
WERE WEIRD,

10:20.988 --> 10:24.725
AND THE TURNS COMPLETELY
TERRIBLE.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.460
I WAS READY FOR SLEEP.
[cackling on tv]

10:27.494 --> 10:30.698
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TURN OFF THE TV
AND GET SOME SLEEP, OKAY?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.565
- NO, I'M WATCHING IT.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.367
- YOU'RE NOT WATCHING,
YOU'RE JUST FLIPPING AROUND.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.669
- OH, IT'S BONNIE AND CLYDE.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.238
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS.
- MM.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.809
- OH, THAT'S SO WEIRD.
- IT'S THE UNIVERSE.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.844
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- ELIZA, PLEASE.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.414
I'VE GOT TO GET TO SLEEP.
- I HAVE TO WATCH THIS.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.317
- AS I DRIFTED OFF TO SLEEP,
I TRIED TO SOOTHE MYSELF

10:50.350 --> 10:51.985
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
NO MATTER WHERE

10:52.019 --> 10:53.921
THIS TERRIFYING JOURNEY TOOK US,

10:53.954 --> 10:57.657
ELIZA AND I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHER.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.693
AND THEN, WE DIDN'T.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.434
WHERE ARE THEY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:07.467 --> 11:08.936
OH, NO.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.071
OH, THE CAR IS GONE.
OH, GOD.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.007
HE MUST HAVE OVERPOWERED HER.
OH, NO.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.777
I'VE GOT TO FIND HER.
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.145
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GONNA GO,
OR EVEN HOW I'M GONNA GET THERE,

11:18.178 --> 11:19.246
IF THE CAR IS GONE.
- FORREST.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.748
- WHAT'S THA--OKAY, WHAT--

11:20.781 --> 11:22.615
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES, OF COURSE.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.085
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.654
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
- YES?

11:27.755 --> 11:31.591
- WE GOT MARRIED.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.261
- ELIZA AND ME.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.528
- WE JUST GOT
TO TALKING LAST NIGHT.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.964
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- AND WE JUST--

11:36.997 --> 11:38.631
- YOU CAN'T--WHA--
YOU JUST MET HIM!

11:38.665 --> 11:40.500
- I JUST MET YOU!
- COME ON.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.369
- HEY, YOU CANNOT MARRY TWO MEN.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.772
- WHAT IS THIS, THE 1800s?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.340
LISTEN, YOU ARE MY HUSBAND...
- YES, I THOUGHT--

11:47.374 --> 11:51.178
- AND I-I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.414
- YEAH.
MM.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.352
OKAY.
OKAY.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.658
- AND I LOVE IGOR,
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.461
GOING ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW

12:08.495 --> 12:11.131
CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE
IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.234
SOME OF THEM ARE EXCITING,
AND SOME OF THEM ARE TERRIBLE.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.970
- AND SOME OF THEM ARE COSMIC.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.140
- WELL, I GIVE BEING ON THE RUN
FROM THE LAW A HALF--UH--

12:22.009 --> 12:25.278
A HALF A--AND ONE--
AND ONE STAR.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.480
[laughter]

12:34.855 --> 12:36.423
- WHAT DO YOU DO,
JUST PRESS THIS THING?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
- YEAH. I PRESS THAT THING.
- OH, THERE IT GOES.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.260
GREAT, UH--
I USUALLY STAND UP HERE.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.594
DO YOU WANT TO COME...
- OKAY.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.695
- STAND WITH ME?
- GOOD, I'LL STAND HERE.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.131
- OKAY. YES.
- OKAY, YEAH.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.967
THIS ONE COMES FROM
@LAWRENCEONINTERNET

12:47.000 --> 12:49.236
IN DEFIANCE, OHIO...

12:54.041 --> 12:56.877
- "JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE TO BE
THE LIFE OF A PARTY."

12:56.910 --> 12:58.846
- I SEE, OKAY.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.213
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.615
I'M GONNA GO BE
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.351
- LOVE IT, LOVE IT.
- HERE WE GO.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.353
- [laughs]
- I HAVE PLANS, SO I'M--

13:06.386 --> 13:08.021
I'M NOT GONNA GO TO THE PARTY.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.890
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT NIGHT
THE PARTY IS HAPPENING.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.292
- I DON'T--
YEAH, I DON'T CARE.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.862
- MY EX-WIFE WAS THROWING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

13:14.862 --> 13:16.463
FOR OUR SON THAT WEEKEND.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.632
HEY THERE, STRANGER!
WHAT TIME'S THE PARTY ON SUNDAY?

13:19.666 --> 13:23.971
BUT ANY CLOWN COULD BE THE HIT
AT A CHILDREN'S AFFAIR.

13:24.004 --> 13:27.040
FOR THIS REVIEW, I WOULD BE
THE LIFE OF MY OWN PARTY,

13:27.074 --> 13:29.877
IN MY NEW HOME WITH
MY NEW FAMILY.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.411
OH, I--EXCUSE ME.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.147
CAN YOU PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS
FOR TONIGHT?

13:34.181 --> 13:38.418
PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.552
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
- NOPE.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.088
- HOW COULD I BE MORE CLEAR?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.123
MY PRESENCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A LIVELY ADDITION

13:43.156 --> 13:45.225
TO ANY SOCIAL GATHERING,
BUT BEING

13:45.258 --> 13:46.894
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
WAS DIFFERENT.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.130
I'D HAVE TO BE
THE FUNNEST PERSON IN THE ROOM,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.999
AND I'D NEED SOME HELP FROM
MY OFFICE STAFF.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.234
IF AT ANY TIME TONIGHT
YOU SEE ME FLOUNDERING--

13:54.267 --> 13:56.069
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
OR WHAT TO SAY, OKAY?--

13:56.103 --> 13:57.670
I NEED YOU TO VERY DISCREETLY

13:57.704 --> 13:59.672
READ ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
ON THESE CARDS.

13:59.706 --> 14:03.810
YOU WILL BE PROMPTING ME TO
TELL SOME OF MY BEST ANECDOTES.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.979
- MR. MACNEIL,
YOU GOT A PACKAGE.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.081
- OH, THIS HAS GOT TO BE
MY NOVELTY ITEMS.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.349
- OH.
- YES, YES! [laughs]

14:09.382 --> 14:11.584
THIS IS JUST A BOX FULL OF FUN.
[laughs]

14:11.618 --> 14:14.087
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
"THE BALD MEN'S COMB."

14:14.121 --> 14:16.523
- BUT THERE'S NO--

14:16.556 --> 14:18.525
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO FUNNY.
- YEAH.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.427
THERE'S NO COMB IN THERE.
- HEY.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.929
both: HELLO.
- OUT FIRST GUESTS!

14:21.929 --> 14:23.530
- HEY.
- [laughs] OH, MY GOODNESS.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.932
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.033
IGOR, I GOT IT, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.200
LET ME WELCOME OUR FIRST GUESTS.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.668
WELCOME!
HEY, I HOPE YOU'RE READY

14:28.701 --> 14:33.406
TO GET YOUR PARTY ON!
[laughs]

14:33.440 --> 14:34.541
OH.

14:34.574 --> 14:38.545
UH--[clears throat].
SO...

14:38.578 --> 14:40.347
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S
A TYPICAL PARTY IN MOST WAYS,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.082
UH, THAT WE HAVE PLANNED.

14:42.115 --> 14:46.019
- HAS ANYONE HERE EVER LEARNED
TO SMOKE THEIR OWN SALMON?

14:46.053 --> 14:48.521
- I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
HOW ARE YOU?
AS MORE PEOPLE ARRIVED,

14:50.257 --> 14:53.293
I DID MY BEST TO MAKE MEANINGFUL
CONNECTIONS WITH EVERYONE.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.062
REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT
THE ARMY,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
AND HOW YOU WERE NEVER IN IT,
BUT ENJOY THE JACKET.

14:57.564 --> 15:02.169
HOW ARE YOU?
ARE YOU A COUPLE? [laughs]

15:02.202 --> 15:03.170
ALL RIGHT, I CAN SENSE THAT
YOU'RE NOT

15:03.203 --> 15:04.537
AND I MADE IT AWKWARD.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.805
SHOULD WE SHAKE HANDS?

15:05.838 --> 15:07.707
I'M DOING FINE.
I'M DOING FINE.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.543
ANY ENTERTAINER WILL TELL YOU,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE

15:10.577 --> 15:12.545
ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.015
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.317
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO SUCCEED.
MY FRIEND!

15:17.350 --> 15:20.453
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
[laughs]

15:20.487 --> 15:22.855
LOOK AT THE LABEL.
IT'S A BALD MAN'S COMB,

15:22.889 --> 15:24.124
AND THE BOX IS EMPTY.

15:24.157 --> 15:28.128
[claps]
[laughs]

15:28.161 --> 15:29.296
SEAN, RIGHT?

15:29.329 --> 15:30.497
- NO.
- NO?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.165
WHO WANTS SOME MILK?
[laughs]

15:32.199 --> 15:33.366
OH, LOOK AT THIS!

15:33.400 --> 15:34.634
MILK COMES RIGHT OUT OF
THE BOOB.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.036
- WHY WOULD I WANT MILK
IN MY BEER?

15:36.069 --> 15:37.570
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT MILK
IN YOUR BEER?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.706
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S FUNNY!

15:39.739 --> 15:41.074
[laughs]
AS THE EVENING PROGRESSED,

15:41.108 --> 15:43.743
I ATTRACTED PLENTY OF ATTENTION
TO MYSELF.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.745
BUT I ALSO ATTRACTED
COMPETITORS,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.747
AND THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE
LIFE OF THE PARTY.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.184
HEY, WHOA, LOOK AT THIS GUY.
OH, FANTASTIC.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.253
OH, MY GOSH.
OH, THAT'S--OH, SHOOT.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.222
NO ONE COULD BE MORE FUN
THAN ME.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.358
- WHOO-HOO!
- AH!

15:58.391 --> 15:59.592
- CAN I PLEASE TALK TO YOU GUYS?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.094
HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.329
- WHAT YOU WERE JUST DOING
IN THERE

16:02.362 --> 16:03.730
WAS BEING THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.465
I'M TRYING TO BE
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.933
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE FOR
THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.502
AND HE HAS TO GO.
GET--GET HIM OUT OF--

16:09.536 --> 16:10.837
GET HIM OUT.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE, GO.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.272
- OKAY.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.940
- BEING THE LIFE OF
THE PARTY WAS HARD,

16:14.041 --> 16:16.276
AND I FOUND THAT NOT ALL OF
MY EFFORTS

16:16.309 --> 16:18.045
WERE APPRECIATED BY MY GUESTS.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.313
HOW'S THAT FOR AN ENTRANCE?
[laughs]

16:20.347 --> 16:21.914
[sings gibberish]

16:21.948 --> 16:24.284
- * GET LOW, GET LOW
MOVE SIDE TO SIDE *

16:24.317 --> 16:26.586
BUT I HAD ONE LAST TRICK UP
MY SLEEVE

16:26.619 --> 16:28.355
TO MAKE THIS PARTY A SENSATION.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.123
COME, UP, UP.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.326
IT ALL CAME DOWN TO THIS.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.732
PERFECT.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.604
FOUR, AND FIVE.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.373
[sighs]

16:46.406 --> 16:49.276
[bleep], YEAH.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.511
[claps]
[thump]

16:51.544 --> 16:55.448
AND THEN, TRAGEDY STRUCK.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.884
UH...

17:01.454 --> 17:04.224
[clicking]

17:05.258 --> 17:07.960
HELLO!

17:07.994 --> 17:09.896
SOMEONE IS STUCK IN
THE BATHROOM!

17:09.929 --> 17:12.799
GENTLEMAN IN THE INDIAN
HEADDRESS, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

17:12.832 --> 17:15.535
I'M IN THE BATHROOM OVER HERE!

17:15.568 --> 17:16.803
[banging]

17:16.836 --> 17:19.539
SOMEONE IS STUCK IN
THE BATHROOM!

17:19.572 --> 17:21.274
I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA COME
AND LOOK FOR ME.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.443
I MEAN, THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
IS STUCK IN THE BATHROOM.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.478
THEY'RE GONNA WONDER WHERE I AM.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.218
I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.222
THE IDEA THAT OUR GUESTS,
AND ESPECIALLY MY DARLING ELIZA,

17:35.255 --> 17:38.825
WERE HAVING HOURS OF FUN
WITHOUT ME WAS DEEPLY UPSETTING.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.361
SOMEONE IS STUCK IN
THE BATHROOM!

17:49.336 --> 17:51.538
IF THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
IS STUCK IN THE BATHROOM

17:51.571 --> 17:54.474
FOR 3 1/2 HOURS, IS HE STILL
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.743
[door opens]

17:56.776 --> 17:59.146
OH.
- OH! GOD, YOU SCARED ME.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.747
THERE YOU ARE.
- YES.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.549
I'VE BEEN LOCKED IN HERE
ALL NIGHT.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.917
- LISTEN, I'M GOING.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.553
- YOU'RE GOING?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.620
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOING?
YOU LIVE HERE.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.821
- NO, I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.490
- YOU DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
- I HAVE THIS FEELING,
AND I JUST HAVE TO

18:12.159 --> 18:13.726
GO WITH IT RIGHT NOW.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.162
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.596
- AND THIS FEELING IS OUTSIDE OF
THE HOUSE.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.064
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

18:18.165 --> 18:19.266
- I HAVE THIS FEELING,
AND I NEED TO FOLLOW IT.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.267
- WHAT FEELING?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.901
- I NEED TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.304
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'RE MARRIED.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.474
- ARE WE?
- YES! WE GOT MARRIED!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.642
- WELL, I WANT
TO MARRY RODERICK.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.811
- I--
[sighs]

18:31.844 --> 18:34.181
WHO IS RODERICK?
- RODERICK!

18:34.181 --> 18:36.349
[car horn beeps]
- I BEEPED THE HORN!

18:36.383 --> 18:38.618
- [laughs]

18:38.651 --> 18:40.753
HE LIVES IN A SUBMARINE.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.789
- [sighs]
- [imitating explosion]

18:42.822 --> 18:47.327
- YEAH, NO, I MEAN--YEAH.
THAT'S--

18:47.360 --> 18:51.063
- FORREST, GOOD LUCK WITH
YOUR WEIRD SHOW.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.567
BYE.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.213
- SWEETHEART--

19:06.246 --> 19:08.248
- OH, MY GOD.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.526
I AM NEVER, EVER GONNA
FORGET YOU.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.129
- I'M SO GLAD
THE UNIVERSE MADE US MEET.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.232
- YOU BASTARD.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.102
[car horn beeps]

19:30.136 --> 19:32.839
WHOO-HOO!
[car starts]

19:42.081 --> 19:45.318
- THAT'S A REALLY RAD COAT.
- THANK YOU.

19:45.352 --> 19:49.422
- HAS ANYONE EVER ACCIDENTALLY
HAD THE WRONG TOOTH PULLED?

19:49.456 --> 19:52.292
- YEAH!
NO, I DID!

19:52.325 --> 19:55.328
OH, MY GOD, IN HIGH SCHOOL!
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.497
I HAD LIKE THE WORST PAIN
IN MY MOUTH,

19:57.530 --> 20:00.400
SO I WENT TO MY FAMILY'S
DENTIST, DR. MORRIS,

20:00.433 --> 20:01.834
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY FACE."

20:01.868 --> 20:03.303
I CAME OUT OF SURGERY
AND THEY WERE LIKE,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.338
"WE DID THE WRONG TOOTH."

20:05.372 --> 20:08.441
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE NO HOPE
OF BEING THE LIFE OF A PARTY

20:08.475 --> 20:10.943
THAT YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
ATTENDING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.013
IN ORDER TO MEAN SOMETHING TO
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU,

20:14.046 --> 20:17.116
YOU FIRST HAVE TO KNOW WHERE
YOU BELONG.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.756
HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING?

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
I HAD COME TO REALIZE
THAT WINNING OVER ADULTS

20:26.326 --> 20:28.428
CAME DOWN TO DUMB GIMMICKS--

20:28.461 --> 20:31.264
A HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE,
A SUBMARINE.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.934
THERE WAS NO SKILL IN THAT,
AND NO SOUL.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.304
BUT TO WIN OVER CHILDREN,

20:37.337 --> 20:40.440
THAT WAS A SIGN
OF SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY,

20:40.473 --> 20:44.377
SOMETHING BETTER, AS I THINK
ALMOST ANYONE COULD SEE.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.313
- YEAH!
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.048
- I WANT TO WAIT FOR
ALL THE KIDS TO HAVE ONE.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.385
- BEING THE LIFE OF THE PARTY,
3 1/2 STARS.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.559
I THINK YOUR PRESENCE
IS NO LONGER NEEDED HERE.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.831
- [clicks tongue]
[sighs]

21:14.374 --> 21:17.810
- RABBI!
LET ME OUT OF THE BATHROOM!

21:19.779 --> 21:22.582
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING
TO THE BATHROOM?

21:22.615 --> 21:23.683
WHAT, ARE YOU JUST PEEING

21:23.716 --> 21:27.354
INTO CUPS OUT THERE?
ANIMALS!
