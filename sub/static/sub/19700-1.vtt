WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.138
WOMAN: I wish we had
the usual problems,

00:04.172 --> 00:07.541
but if there's any slip,
it's gonna get worse.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.911
ANNOUNCER: The Americans,
all new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.981
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.788
*

00:50.418 --> 00:53.421
*

01:21.282 --> 01:24.017
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

01:35.196 --> 01:36.464
(bell rings)

01:40.033 --> 01:42.035
(indistinct conversations)

01:46.940 --> 01:49.510
OLIVIA de HAVILLAND: There was
never a rivalry like theirs.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.414
For nearly half a century,
they hated each other,

01:53.447 --> 01:56.517
and we loved them for it.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.654
You know, Joan's real name
was Lucille LeSueur.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.957
The poor thing, she was raised
in utter squalor.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.593
I mean literally.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.728
Scrubbed toilets before
coming to Hollywood.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.831
At the peak of the Depression--

02:10.864 --> 02:13.801
that's when
I first started out--

02:13.834 --> 02:17.705
she was the woman
every man wanted

02:17.738 --> 02:20.040
and every woman wanted to be.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.975
Many think of her

02:22.009 --> 02:25.145
as the greatest star
of all time.

02:25.179 --> 02:29.149
Now, my dear friend Bette...

02:29.183 --> 02:31.118
well, she, quite frankly,

02:31.151 --> 02:34.688
was the greatest actress
Hollywood had ever known.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.291
During the war,

02:37.325 --> 02:41.562
she played all the best roles,
and she played them with a...

02:41.595 --> 02:43.231
I-I don't know how to say this,

02:43.264 --> 02:47.034
but with a ballsy intensity
that none of us,

02:47.067 --> 02:50.070
actor or actress,
would have dared.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.807
You know, they only made
one film together.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.376
And how that happened

02:55.409 --> 02:58.646
and what happened afterwards,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.180
well...

03:00.214 --> 03:02.683
well, that was a story

03:02.716 --> 03:04.885
and a feud

03:04.918 --> 03:07.521
of biblical proportions.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.523
What was behind their feud?

03:09.557 --> 03:12.426
Why did they hate
each other so much?

03:12.460 --> 03:16.129
Feuds are never about hate.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.367
Feuds are about pain.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.573
They're about pain.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.341
ANNOUNCER: Please welcome
to the stage, tonight's winner,

03:27.375 --> 03:29.009
Miss Marilyn Monroe!

03:29.042 --> 03:30.744
(sweeping orchestra music plays,
cheering and applause)

03:40.454 --> 03:42.055
I've got great tits, too,

03:42.089 --> 03:43.924
but I don't throw them
in everyone's face.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.293
All right, darling.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.196
MARILYN (giggles):
Gee.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.400
Gosh, I just sure
didn't expect this.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.603
You know, I always said that,
if I was the star,

03:55.636 --> 03:58.872
it was because the people
made me a star, and...

03:58.906 --> 04:01.041
You know,
when I was a girl,

04:01.074 --> 04:04.211
I used to look out into
the Hollywood sky and think,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.780
"Gosh, I just want to be
a movie star," you know?

04:06.814 --> 04:08.048
(chuckles)

04:08.081 --> 04:09.817
And now I'm
part of you.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.219
So, thank you
so much.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.788
Gosh, I should try to
thank some people, huh?

04:14.822 --> 04:17.325
I'm just so bad at
remembering names.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.626
(car door closes)

04:21.429 --> 04:23.331
(doorbell rings)

04:23.364 --> 04:24.998
Hedda Hopper for Joan.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.267
Miss Crawford
is occupied.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.337
She's had enough time
to sleep it off.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.938
Announce me.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.447
Is there anything we can do
about these lines?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.450
I'm afraid I'm gonna be served
for Thanksgiving dinner.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.318
The best you can do
for this? High collars.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.186
Turtle neck
for turkey neck.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.622
Christ, Nonah,
can't you give me some hope?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.123
Ugh. You know
how it is.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.859
Men age, they get character.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.461
Women age, they get lost.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.162
(knocks on door)
What?

04:55.195 --> 04:56.997
I'm sorry, Miss Joan.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.199
Hedda Hopper's
downstairs.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.470
(quietly):
Oh, Jesus.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.343
Hedda.
(chuckles)

05:09.377 --> 05:12.145
You know I never receive
unscheduled guests,

05:12.179 --> 05:13.447
not even my children.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
(both chuckle)
But here you are.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.787
Well, you ran out of
the Globes last night

05:19.820 --> 05:21.355
before I could
get a quote.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.223
Did I?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.359
Mamacita? Coffee.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.998
Well, it was a
marvelous event.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.800
I do so appreciate
the foreign press.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.802
They've been so
very kind to me.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.838
I didn't come here for
the boilerplate, Joan.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.241
From what I hear, you stumbled
out of there in a drunken fit.

05:41.274 --> 05:44.344
JOAN:
I'm gonna go back inside.
MAN: Baby...

05:44.378 --> 05:47.415
Well, you know how those
award dinners can be.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.317
Stop it!

05:50.350 --> 05:53.353
I must've eaten something
that disagreed with me.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.354
Crow?

05:54.388 --> 05:55.889
(grunts)

05:55.923 --> 05:57.758
HEDDA: Had to have been
pretty galling,

05:57.791 --> 06:01.929
watching the foreign press
fawn all over Monroe like that.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.433
JOAN: Hedda, you know, when I'm
out in public events like that,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.267
I only drink Pepsi-Cola.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.903
I am the brand
ambassador.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.572
I don't know why
you keep plugging

06:11.605 --> 06:13.607
that shitty sugar water.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.208
Word is, since Al died,

06:15.242 --> 06:16.877
the board isn't paying
your bills anymore,

06:16.910 --> 06:19.079
and you're having
to sell your custom

06:19.112 --> 06:21.449
Billy Haines furniture
piece by piece

06:21.482 --> 06:23.584
just to keep the lights on.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.919
You wouldn't print
those lies.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.421
Got to print something.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.858
All right.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.593
Then print this:

06:34.662 --> 06:38.365
Joan Crawford, after mourning

06:38.398 --> 06:42.402
the passing of her husband,
the beloved

06:42.436 --> 06:44.304
Alfred Steele,

06:44.337 --> 06:47.641
is ready to get back to work.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.209
Oh, come on, Joan.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.111
Give me a quote.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.380
You know my readers
would be fascinated

06:53.413 --> 06:56.149
with hearing the thoughts
of yesterday's it girl

06:56.183 --> 06:57.485
about today's.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.957
There can only be room
for one it girl.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.593
Is that right?

07:05.626 --> 07:08.496
Well, men built the pedestal,
darling, not me.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.932
There's only room for
one goddess at a time.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.801
Well, men may have
built the pedestal,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.504
but it's the women who
keep chipping away at it

07:16.537 --> 07:18.572
until it comes
tumbling down.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.641
So what's it
gonna be, honey?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.943
A quote on Monroe,

07:22.976 --> 07:25.245
or am I gonna have to
write about how a valet

07:25.278 --> 07:28.215
saw you stumble
into a Cadillac?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.027
All right.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.065
(chuckles)
Good.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.371
I think that Marilyn Monroe
and the vulgarity

07:51.404 --> 07:53.774
of her clothing and pictures

07:53.807 --> 07:57.545
is ruining this great industry
that I love.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.348
People don't want to see stars
like Monroe in pictures.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.051
They want their stars
to be wholesome,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.820
with good morals.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.190
Like me.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.226
That's not the only difference
between you and her.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.563
She's getting roles.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.800
What's this about?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.334
This, my friend,

08:21.368 --> 08:26.006
is the Academy Award for
Best Actress I won in 1945

08:26.039 --> 08:27.407
for Mildred Pierce.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.910
And I would like another one.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.445
And do you know what I need,
Marty, to make that happen?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.783
A great script.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.187
I want to work
now that Al's dead.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.155
I want to work, Marty.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.724
I need to work.

08:43.757 --> 08:46.159
I sent you a great script
four months ago, Joan.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.095
You did it, and you
were wonderful in it.
No.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.396
It was a pilot.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.164
I had to do
my own makeup,

08:51.198 --> 08:53.734
and it wasn't even
picked up to series.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.236
Joan, how about this,

08:56.269 --> 08:58.706
let me read everything
that's out there,

08:58.739 --> 09:00.240
send over
the highlights.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.675
You go through the pile

09:01.709 --> 09:04.044
and find something
that excites you.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.079
*

09:13.220 --> 09:15.055
MARTY:
Joanie!

09:15.088 --> 09:17.424
JOAN:
I can't play
Elvis' grandmother.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.126
I won't do it.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.861
Maybe you better send me
some other scripts.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.195
That's all I have, Joan.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.364
That's all they're making.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.033
Marty,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.802
I am an actress, I want to act.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.938
I'm at the top of my game
right now.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.606
Then you need to find
a project yourself,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.241
'cause the roles
just aren't out there.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.621
May I help you?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.489
I need books.

09:49.522 --> 09:53.293
Was there a particular title
you were interested in?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.362
Anything with ladies
on the cover.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.905
(door opens)

10:04.938 --> 10:05.906
(sighs)

10:05.939 --> 10:07.174
(door closes)

10:09.276 --> 10:11.611
Oh, Mamacita. Good.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.981
That's all they had.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.415
I could try
Encino next.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.117
Unless you found
something you like.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.786
Everything written
for women seem to fall

10:18.819 --> 10:21.021
into just three categories:

10:21.054 --> 10:23.523
ingГ©nues, mothers, or gorgons.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.792
So where does that leave you?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.629
We'll find something.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.401
No, no, Mamacita,
nothing Sapphic.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.137
I ran into
the gardeners outside.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.605
They want to know when
they'll get paid.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.440
We owe them two months.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.142
What did you tell them?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.311
That it was an honor to
prune Miss Crawford's bush

10:44.344 --> 10:45.578
and to shut up.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.987
(sighs)

10:54.021 --> 10:55.956
These are lean times, Mamacita,

10:55.989 --> 10:58.491
but we'll get through them.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.799
This one is about a baby.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.835
Which pile, "mothers"?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.409
(sighs)

11:25.452 --> 11:27.054
(soundstage bell rings)

11:27.087 --> 11:28.588
ROBERT ALDRICH:
And action!

11:31.925 --> 11:33.927
Cut! Cut! Plywood.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.162
You get them
plywood in there...

11:35.195 --> 11:36.563
Plywood.
Plywood.
Plywood.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.832
Dad, you're needed
in the control center, pronto.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.033
Plywood.
Plywood!

11:40.067 --> 11:41.368
If I make another
sandal saga,

11:41.401 --> 11:43.603
put a bullet in my head.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.742
Eva Braun's on the horn.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.945
I told her you're busy,
but she keeps calling back.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.683
Gretchen, my love.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.419
How's my little strudel?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.956
What? No, no, you can't
come down here today.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.892
Why? Because my kids are
working on the set,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.226
that's why.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.429
What if word got back
to my wife?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.365
Yeah.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.967
I'll call you back.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.268
Christ.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.804
She wants to be
in the movie now.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.806
Well, that's because
she knows the only time

12:18.839 --> 12:20.440
you really pay attention
to a woman is when

12:20.473 --> 12:21.975
she's in front
of your camera.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.615
This movie we're
making, Pauline,

12:28.648 --> 12:30.650
it is a piece of crap.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.319
Hey, what about
that espionage script?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.653
Oh, no, stinko.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.455
I know who did it
on page three.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.826
But... this one...

12:38.859 --> 12:41.261
This one has potential.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.463
Horror/thriller,
two broads,

12:43.496 --> 12:44.798
former movie stars.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.334
A cripple and her crazy sister

12:47.367 --> 12:49.136
battling it out
in their Hollywood home.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.572
(sighs):
A horror picture?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.640
Hitch just did it
with Psycho.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.142
Still raking it in.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.345
But even better,
Baby Jane has one set.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.413
It's a very small cast.
You can have final cut.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.082
You can produce this yourself.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.985
Face it, Bob, Ben-Hur
has already been done.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.486
Where'd you get this?

13:06.519 --> 13:10.457
Oh, it came by messenger,
special delivery.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.128
Along with this.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.711
BOY: Miss Crawford?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.314
Yes?

13:36.683 --> 13:38.285
Special delivery.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.719
("Autumn Leaves"
by Nat King Cole playing)

13:39.752 --> 13:42.255
(engine starts)

13:44.391 --> 13:46.393
(car door closes, car departs)

13:51.598 --> 13:55.068
* The falling leaves *

13:56.536 --> 13:58.705
* Drift by the window *

13:58.738 --> 14:00.040
She's expecting you.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.977
* The autumn leaves *

14:04.011 --> 14:06.713
* Of red and gold *

14:06.746 --> 14:08.415
She's expecting you
on the patio.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.219
* I see your lips *

14:12.252 --> 14:16.156
* The summer kisses *

14:16.189 --> 14:19.927
* The sunburned hands *

14:19.960 --> 14:22.429
* I used to hold *

14:22.462 --> 14:23.763
Joanie.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.032
Bob.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.000
Tea?
If we're gonna
talk business,

14:27.034 --> 14:28.902
I'm gonna need
a real drink.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.738
Sally, dear, will you
go in the house

14:31.771 --> 14:35.508
and see if Mamacita
needs any help?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.110
One of your fans?

14:37.144 --> 14:39.212
Well, if they're going
to hang around all day,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.448
I'm going to
put them to work.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.387
* Most of all, my darling *

14:47.420 --> 14:50.823
So, are we gonna
make this picture?

14:51.891 --> 14:55.128
* Start to fall *

14:55.162 --> 14:57.630
If you can satisfy
my demands.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.399
Can anybody, Joanie?

14:59.432 --> 15:01.101
We did pretty well
the last time.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.569
Autumn Leaves
made millions.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.903
It would have made
a million more

15:03.937 --> 15:05.038
if you'd gotten off
your goddamn high horse

15:05.072 --> 15:06.473
and let me
mess you up a little.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.141
It would have made
$2 million more

15:08.175 --> 15:09.476
if you'd gotten me Brando.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.378
Now, you listen to me
on this picture.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.746
I'll get you
the perfect costar.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.649
Who do you have
in mind?

15:16.683 --> 15:20.653
* Start to fall. *

15:31.264 --> 15:34.501
MAN: I didn't know the patrona
had turned to a widow,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.669
a sort of bright
widow spider.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.705
(applause)

15:48.715 --> 15:50.450
Cocktails, anybody?

15:50.483 --> 15:53.520
(laughter)

15:53.553 --> 15:55.122
No, thank you,
Mrs. Faulk.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.356
I don't believe
we'll have any.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.824
MAN: They don't
serve cocktails

15:57.857 --> 16:00.493
between the fish
and the entree, Maxine, honey.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.429
WOMAN: Mercilessly accurate,
Mr. Shannon.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.031
MAN:
But when I asked you for one,

16:04.064 --> 16:06.499
you offered it to me
without a sign of reluctance.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.967
WOMAN:
Aren't you making a large point

16:08.001 --> 16:09.302
out of a small matter?

16:09.336 --> 16:10.837
MAN: Just the
opposite, honey.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.172
I'm making a small point

16:12.205 --> 16:14.874
out of a very
large matter.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.777
Where'd you learn how
to light a match in the wind?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.046
WOMAN:
Oh, I've learned lots of useful

16:19.079 --> 16:20.280
little things along the way.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.449
I only wish I'd
learned some big ones.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.716
MAN:
Such as what?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.818
WOMAN: How to help you,
Mr. Shannon.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.354
MAN: Now I know why
I've come here.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.688
WOMAN: So you can meet someone
who knows how

16:28.721 --> 16:29.956
to light a match in the wind?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.992
(applause)

16:38.565 --> 16:40.567
*

17:04.857 --> 17:07.160
(knocking)
What?!

17:07.194 --> 17:09.396
There's a lady here to see you.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.563
Who is it?

17:10.597 --> 17:13.032
Joan Crawford.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.270
You're fucking kidding me.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.605
Bette.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.207
Lucille, what the hell

17:20.240 --> 17:21.208
brings you to the theater?

17:21.241 --> 17:22.909
Well, you, of course.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.211
Oh, you were
wonderful tonight.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.012
You lit up the stage.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.248
I can't believe you
didn't get better reviews.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.050
New York critics, they
don't like us Hollywood people

17:31.084 --> 17:33.052
coming in, taking over
their town.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.088
I say screw 'em.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.257
Make it quick, Lucille,
I've got a car waiting

17:37.290 --> 17:38.458
to take me to the country.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.728
Guess what, Bette.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.297
I have finally found
the perfect project

17:44.331 --> 17:46.032
for the two of us.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.735
It's always been my dream
to work with you.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.903
Do you remember how
I begged Jack Warner

17:50.937 --> 17:53.039
to put us together
in Ethan Frome?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.541
With Mr. Gary Cooper.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.143
You do remember.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.077
You wanted to play the pretty
young servant girl,

17:58.111 --> 18:00.046
and I was to play
the old hag of a wife.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.047
Forget it.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.284
But this is different.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.818
These are the parts
of a lifetime.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.120
No, thanks, Lucille.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.955
I've got plenty
of better offers.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.923
(chuckles):
Bullshit.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.326
I know what kind
of offers you've been getting.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.828
Exactly none, because
the same is true for me.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.298
They're not making
women's pictures anymore.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.233
Not the kind we used to make.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.434
It's all cyclical.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.435
They'll come back
in fashion.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.137
But we won't.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.805
If something's
going to happen,

18:25.838 --> 18:27.474
we have to make it happen.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.777
No one's looking
to cast women our age.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.013
But together,

18:34.046 --> 18:36.616
they wouldn't dare
say no.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.321
We need each other, Bette.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.493
So what the hell happened
to her anyway, Baby Jane?

18:46.526 --> 18:50.463
Read it.
Find out.

18:50.497 --> 18:55.902
Oh, I-I'm offering you
the title role.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.472
The lead?

19:02.175 --> 19:04.477
You can call it that.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.427
* In the evening *

19:23.330 --> 19:25.898
* In the evening, people *

19:25.932 --> 19:29.269
* When the sun goes down *

19:32.171 --> 19:34.907
* Don't your heart feel
mighty empty? *

19:34.941 --> 19:36.142
Thank you.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.144
* When your baby's not around *

19:38.177 --> 19:40.847
B.D.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.882
*

20:23.089 --> 20:26.926
* If I could holler *

20:26.959 --> 20:30.797
* Just like a mountain jack *

20:30.830 --> 20:34.434
* Then I would go
way up on the mountain *

20:34.467 --> 20:37.904
* And call my baby back *

20:37.937 --> 20:41.908
* In the e... *

20:51.418 --> 20:52.819
* Evening... *

20:52.852 --> 20:54.654
* In the evening *

20:54.687 --> 20:57.657
* When the sun goes down *
(telephone rings)

20:57.690 --> 21:00.393
(receiver picks up)
BETTE:
Did you fuck Joan Crawford?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.829
No, I did not fuck her.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.431
Not that I didn't have
ample opportunity.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.665
We all know
what special relationship

21:05.698 --> 21:07.900
Joan has with her directors.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.901
Oh, come on, Bette.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.403
William Wyler?

21:10.437 --> 21:13.072
Oh, I see someone has been
a good little boy

21:13.105 --> 21:14.507
and done all his homework.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.176
Bette, listen, here's the deal.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.512
Crawford's name on the marquee
gets us distribution.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.914
I need her to get the picture
made, but I need you

21:21.948 --> 21:23.516
to make the picture great.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.851
Keep talking.

21:24.884 --> 21:25.852
Bette, listen,
I've made my share

21:25.885 --> 21:27.153
of steaming piles of shit,

21:27.186 --> 21:28.488
but every now and again
I get a chance

21:28.521 --> 21:29.922
to work with an artist like you.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.758
Someone who isn't afraid
to leap off a cliff.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.361
Most people are terrified
to go anywhere near the edge.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.828
Now, that gets me excited.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.931
I-I'm a kid again.
Everything's possible.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.700
Bette, I promise you
this is gonna be

21:40.733 --> 21:43.135
the greatest horror movie
ever made.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.204
And Baby Jane's the greatest
part you'll play

21:45.237 --> 21:46.806
since Margo Channing.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.675
All right, answer this question,

21:48.708 --> 21:51.010
and don't lie--

21:51.043 --> 21:52.479
why this picture?

21:54.246 --> 21:56.983
Honestly?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.018
I'm not being offered
anything else.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.688
(chuckles)

22:01.721 --> 22:05.191
You're too big
for Broadway, Bette.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.395
Come back to Hollywood,
where you belong.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.666
I'll get back to you, Bob.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.406
(rain falling outside)

22:21.107 --> 22:23.776
(thunder rumbles)

22:31.451 --> 22:33.420
*

22:33.453 --> 22:35.455
(indistinct conversations)

22:39.426 --> 22:41.227
STUDIO EXECUTIVE:
It's a socko script, Bob,
just socko.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.896
We ran the numbers and it
looks doable, very doable.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.097
Fantastic.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.433
We feel like
Crawford and Davis

22:46.466 --> 22:47.934
may be a little
long in the tooth.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.536
Why don't we go just
a little bit younger?

22:49.569 --> 22:51.404
How about Hepburn
in the Blanche role?

22:51.438 --> 22:53.372
Well, Katherine Hepburn's
the same age as Davis.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.874
I think she's a year older.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.577
Audrey Hepburn and
Doris Day as Baby Jane.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.345
STUDIO EXECUTIVE 2:
Are you kidding?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.448
We love Davis and
Crawford for this.
Oh, that's terrific.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.049
Now, the character of
the sexy neighbor girl,

23:03.082 --> 23:04.517
have you thought about that?
Not really.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.786
I-It's a small part.
Yeah. Let's beef that up.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.522
In fact, we want to tell the
story from her point of view.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.257
You know, like Hitchcock
did with Rear Window.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.892
It's not really a story
about a sexy neighbor girl.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.527
We want to make it about her.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.962
We've been looking for
something for Natalie Wood.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.229
STUDIO EXECUTIVE 3:
It's not gonna work here, Bob.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.699
No, I-I won't take no
for an answer, Ed.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.267
These two women are legends.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.202
They've got millions of fans
across the globe

23:23.235 --> 23:24.804
who would pay good money
just for the chance

23:24.837 --> 23:26.573
to see them together on-screen.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.075
I agree, but it's not Davis
and Crawford we don't want,

23:29.108 --> 23:30.610
it's you, Bob.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.779
They're just not willing
to get into bed with you.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.214
Not after Sodom.
No offense.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.617
Bromo.

23:42.321 --> 23:44.223
Would you fuck 'em?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.292
I don't know.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.961
(chuckles) It's a very
simple question, Bobby.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.931
Would you give either of those
broads a toss in the hay?

23:51.964 --> 23:53.600
* Catch a falling star... *
Would you fuck 'em?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.234
(laughs)
Yes.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.503
What?

23:56.536 --> 23:59.639
(chuckling):
Bullshit.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.674
It's a no, Bobby.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.409
Sorry.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.912
So every other studio passed
on this project, huh?

24:05.945 --> 24:07.980
And you come to me
as the last resort?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.016
I find that disrespectful.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.152
No. Not last,
Jack... inevitable.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.354
It's kismet that we
make the movie here.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.690
Warner Brothers is the studio
where both Davis

24:17.724 --> 24:20.527
and Crawford worked when they
were still under contract.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.261
I-It'll be like a homecoming.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.763
You know, I can see
the headlines.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.331
They're still big stars.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.933
Big has-beens, you mean.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.968
All right, that's good.
That's enough, that's good.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.670
And big pains in my ass.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.304
Both those women made
my life a living hell

24:32.338 --> 24:33.706
when they worked for me,

24:33.740 --> 24:35.808
because they thought
that I worked for them.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.009
(spanks)
Ooh.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.648
More perks,
more perks, more perks.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.650
And always questioning
the material

24:43.683 --> 24:45.952
that I wanted them
to do, always.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.387
Oh, come on, Jack.
No. It's true.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.856
And you know what
the worst part is?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.223
The ingratitude.

24:51.257 --> 24:54.226
I created goddesses, Bobby.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.828
I created goddesses.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.898
I was Zeus and they were
a couple of Aphrodites.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.299
But you know what happens
to Aphrodite

25:00.332 --> 25:02.168
when her tits start to sag

25:02.201 --> 25:04.370
and her pictures
start losing money?

25:04.403 --> 25:06.573
Or Venus, who should just look
pretty and keep her mouth shut,

25:06.606 --> 25:08.507
and she starts having
an opinion about everything--

25:08.541 --> 25:10.309
you know what happens to her?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.478
Zeus picks up a lightning bolt

25:12.511 --> 25:15.047
and he hurls it right at her
head and he splits it open.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.448
That's what happens.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.820
I need a lunch thing.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.756
And my clothing.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.858
You've got a pretty short
goddamn memory, Bobby.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.595
What does that mean?

25:28.628 --> 25:32.198
That bitch Davis sued me in 1936
to get out of her contract.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.833
She literally sued me.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.935
Bobby, I was so upset
about that,

25:35.968 --> 25:38.671
that I got an ulcer
and hemorrhoids from it.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.907
I still have them.
I'll show them to you.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.042
And you know what else?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.612
I won that suit,
I won it.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.279
And she was ordered
to come back to work for me...

25:47.313 --> 25:49.381
She just wanted better parts,
Jack.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.683
A say in her own destiny.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.284
Yeah, okay, fine.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.587
But because of her selfishness
and her bullheadedness,

25:54.621 --> 25:58.290
the entire studio contract
system came crashing down!

25:58.324 --> 26:01.093
The whole thing because of her!

26:01.127 --> 26:03.630
She's the one who put the crack
in the levee,

26:03.663 --> 26:05.397
and you want me
to work with her again?

26:05.431 --> 26:06.966
Are you fucking crazy?!

26:06.999 --> 26:08.434
Never!

26:08.467 --> 26:09.636
Never again.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.971
Never. That cunt!

26:12.004 --> 26:15.708
* Save it for a rainy day *

26:15.742 --> 26:19.646
* Save it
for a rainy day *

26:19.679 --> 26:22.915
Her unemployment
is my long-simmering revenge.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.619
* Save it for a rainy day *

26:30.657 --> 26:33.092
You're gonna
make my picture, Jack.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.561
I'm s-sorry?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.164
You need it.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.000
Television is kicking your ass.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.903
Oh...
And the movies you're
making, they're all bombs.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.639
Crowded Sky? Bomb.
Bad title.

26:46.673 --> 26:50.109
Fever in the Blood-- you
couldn't even give tickets away.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.344
And you know why?
You got no stars.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.980
I got stars.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.315
I got a great script
that I wrote myself,

26:56.348 --> 26:57.784
a script I believe in.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.852
And I've got a genre

26:59.886 --> 27:03.455
television isn't doing, Jack--
horror.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.629
Hmm.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.632
No.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.635
We got most of our financing
from Seven Arts.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.271
Yeah. Seven Arts, yeah, yeah.
I just need you to release
the picture in your theaters.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.340
You'll be the single largest
profit participant.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.843
Yeah.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.183
I'll pay you first.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.890
(camera shutters clicking)

27:37.924 --> 27:40.492
(photographers clamoring)

27:40.526 --> 27:42.628
REPORTER:
Miss Davis,

27:42.661 --> 27:44.630
how do you feel
about Baby Jane Hudson?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.165
We hear she's pretty mean.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.668
She's full of venom
and doesn't mince words.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.004
We have nothing in common.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.840
JOAN:
Which is wonderful
for me, Jimmy.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.876
Usually, I play the bitch,
but this time,

27:56.909 --> 27:59.411
I can sit back
and watch Bette do it.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.913
(laughter)

28:02.581 --> 28:05.551
I told you, together
they're an event.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.691
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

28:12.725 --> 28:15.394
(Warner sighs)
PHOTOGRAPHER: How about signing
some contracts, ladies?

28:18.197 --> 28:20.332
Who do you think's gonna grab
the chair on the left?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.567
What do you mean?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.002
Whoever gets there first
gets top billing

28:23.035 --> 28:24.636
right underneath the caption
in tomorrow's paper.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.741
Why, thank you, Lucille.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.948
How about one
with the two of you

28:35.982 --> 28:37.249
signing your contracts?

28:43.122 --> 28:44.556
Oh, man, that's great.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.628
*

29:03.675 --> 29:06.345
PHOTOGRAPHER:
And one more.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.719
Get the car, Mamacita.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.754
ROBERT: Joan, you didn't
sign the contract.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.724
JOAN: You know, I expected more
from you, Bob, I truly did,

29:18.757 --> 29:20.159
though why I don't know.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.828
Starting with my no-good father,

29:21.861 --> 29:24.330
who ran off with a stripper
from Galveston,

29:24.363 --> 29:27.299
to Louis B. Mayer,
I have been lied to

29:27.333 --> 29:30.669
and cheated on
by men my entire life.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.304
I don't know why you
should be any different.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.772
What are you talking
about, Joan?

29:38.277 --> 29:42.514
She's getting 600
more dollars a week

29:42.548 --> 29:44.516
in expenses than I am.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.919
Now, I cannot go
into this project

29:46.953 --> 29:49.588
feeling resentment
for my costar.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.457
Not after it was my idea

29:51.490 --> 29:53.792
to throw this party
in the first place.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.696
I bet you never treated
Kirk Douglas like this,

29:57.729 --> 29:59.298
did you, on The Last Sunset?

29:59.331 --> 30:01.667
It's an oversight, Joan.
I'll take care of it.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.036
I promise.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.878
You understand, don't you, Bob?

30:11.911 --> 30:15.848
It's not about the money.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.618
It's about trust.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.687
Of course.

30:31.097 --> 30:34.600
I want $1,500.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.376
JOAN BLONDELL:
The 1950s and early '60s

30:44.410 --> 30:47.313
were tough times
for all us mature gals.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.016
The studio system
was dying out big time,

30:50.049 --> 30:51.750
and the only women who were
getting hired were--

30:51.783 --> 30:53.652
well, they had big chests
and small brains.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.321
(laughs)

30:55.354 --> 30:56.722
Say, is this documentary
gonna be about

30:56.755 --> 30:58.357
all of us or just Joanie?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.858
Is it like
That's Entertainment?

30:59.892 --> 31:01.360
ADAM:
Um, I'm not sure.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.996
Well, honey, I'm sure
both people who see it

31:04.030 --> 31:05.898
are gonna love it.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.100
Can somebody get this girl
a drink here?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.669
Thanks, honey.
Well, what were we
talking about?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.538
ADAM:
How tough it was for women
in the '50s.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.706
Right. But not for Joan.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.242
Wow.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.210
She was really something.

31:18.244 --> 31:21.880
She barreled through that decade
like a freight train.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.918
Thanks.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.954
Hmm.

31:29.788 --> 31:33.092
Who cares if her costars were
getting younger and younger?

31:33.125 --> 31:34.726
She was still Joan.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.030
Still ambitious as hell.
And making hits

31:38.064 --> 31:41.900
till she got
the best offer of her career:

31:41.934 --> 31:43.269
A proposal from a widower,

31:43.302 --> 31:46.105
Al Steele, CEO of Pepsi-Cola,

31:46.138 --> 31:48.774
and one of the wealthiest men
in the country.

31:48.807 --> 31:52.378
With all that money, after 40
years of working her ass off,

31:52.411 --> 31:54.646
and sweating over
every goddamn dime,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.483
she could finally exhale
and live the high life.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.718
Al, you may kiss the bride.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.988
(giggles)
Come to Mama.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.755
Oh, yeah!

32:03.789 --> 32:05.224
BLONDELL:
Bette...

32:05.257 --> 32:07.493
well, she was
a different story.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.096
After All About Eve,
she was on top of the world.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.132
And she thought she'd be
swamped by offers,

32:13.165 --> 32:17.503
but her biggest comeback turned
into her biggest letdown.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.272
So Bette decided to throw
herself into the one role

32:20.306 --> 32:23.242
she'd never gotten right:
wife and mother.

32:23.275 --> 32:27.013
She married her All About Eve
costar, Gary Merrill.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.314
(door opening)

32:28.347 --> 32:32.118
Bette was, to say the least...

32:32.151 --> 32:35.154
miscast.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.163
*

32:59.511 --> 33:02.681
Hello, wife.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.186
Make yourself useful for once.

33:07.219 --> 33:11.290
So I've been reading
about you and Crawford.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.292
Start shooting next week?

33:13.325 --> 33:16.128
Day five I get to kick
her right in the head.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.030
I can't wait.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.398
So what brings you

33:19.431 --> 33:22.134
crawling back to Hollywood?

33:22.168 --> 33:25.003
Another guest shot
on Wagon Train?

33:25.037 --> 33:26.872
Twilight Zone, actually.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.374
Oh. Well, that
should be easy for you.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.143
Our whole marriage
was a Twilight Zone.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.212
You went to bed
with Margo Channing

33:33.245 --> 33:35.314
and you woke up with me.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.749
So why did we stop living
together again?

33:39.085 --> 33:40.819
You wanted me
to starch your shirts

33:40.852 --> 33:42.054
and greet you at the door

33:42.088 --> 33:43.555
with a martini
in hand and ask,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.757
"How did your day
at work go, darling?"
Mm.

33:45.791 --> 33:49.161
I'm the one that needed a wife.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.829
I brought you something.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.798
You've wanted it
for a long time.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.208
(sighs)
Here it is.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.243
It's all there.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.515
I gave you everything:
houses, kids, bank accounts,

34:09.548 --> 34:11.683
even the broken china.
You goddamned prick!

34:11.717 --> 34:13.352
Oh, admit it.
You don't want me,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.087
but you can't stand
the idea of me being

34:15.121 --> 34:16.688
with anybody else.
Who would have you,

34:16.722 --> 34:18.790
you broken-down has-been?
You viper.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.659
You drunk.
Takes one to know one.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.063
(both laughing)

34:39.811 --> 34:42.381
BLONDELL: You know
why they really broke up?

34:42.414 --> 34:44.550
Well, it wasn't
his performance in bed.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.552
It was his performance onstage.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.221
God, was Gary a stiff.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.090
Just when Bette realized her
marriage was about to close,

34:52.124 --> 34:54.993
she took it on the road.

34:55.026 --> 34:57.263
GARY: "Let the lights
of Broadway spangle

34:57.296 --> 34:59.298
"and splatter-- and the taxis

34:59.331 --> 35:01.500
"hustle the crowds away
when the show is over.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.935
"Let the lights of Broadway
spangle. The girls wash off

35:03.969 --> 35:06.572
"the paint and go for
their midnight sandwiches--

35:06.605 --> 35:08.807
"let 'em dream in the morning
sun, late in the morning,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.576
"long after the
morning papers,

35:10.609 --> 35:13.145
and dream as long as they want
to in June somewhere..."

35:13.179 --> 35:15.314
BLONDELL: You know,
she fired him from the tour.

35:15.347 --> 35:18.150
Her own husband. And replaced
him the very next day

35:18.184 --> 35:19.685
with Barry Sullivan.

35:19.718 --> 35:23.121
*

35:23.155 --> 35:26.658
* I... *

35:26.692 --> 35:30.662
* Love all *

35:32.030 --> 35:35.201
* The many charms about you *

35:39.671 --> 35:43.542
* Above all *

35:47.012 --> 35:50.716
* I want my arms *

35:50.749 --> 35:53.585
* About you *

35:57.923 --> 36:01.860
* Naughty, naughty baby *

36:01.893 --> 36:04.162
* Come to mama *

36:04.196 --> 36:07.433
* Come to mama do... *

36:10.202 --> 36:12.504
When Bette had to choose,

36:12.538 --> 36:16.074
she always picked the
professional over the private.

36:16.107 --> 36:20.646
JOAN: She actually claimed
she coined the term "Oscar."

36:20.679 --> 36:22.080
Can you believe that?

36:22.113 --> 36:23.515
Back when she nabbed the award

36:23.549 --> 36:25.183
for Dangerous in '35,

36:25.217 --> 36:26.585
she told the press that

36:26.618 --> 36:28.354
its posterior reminded her

36:28.387 --> 36:30.589
of her first husband's ass.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.823
His middle name was Oscar.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.859
No one ever called him that.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.495
(scoffs) It was just more
of her bullshit.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.498
His name was Harmon.
Everyone called him Ham.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.766
Joanie,

36:40.799 --> 36:43.034
do you have to keep doing that?

36:43.068 --> 36:45.604
What? It keeps my elbows supple.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.607
I wasn't talking about that.
Do you realize from the time

36:48.640 --> 36:51.277
we got in the car tonight,
all through dinner, and now

36:51.310 --> 36:53.379
all you've done is complain
about Bette Davis?

36:53.412 --> 36:55.013
Oh, that is not true.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.849
It is. And I'll be honest,
I don't understand it.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.252
You two have so much in common.
More than any two other people

37:00.286 --> 37:03.255
on the planet. Why
can't you just get along?

37:03.289 --> 37:06.592
Oh, don't you think I've tried?

37:06.625 --> 37:09.094
Back when she won that Oscar,
I was the first person

37:09.127 --> 37:13.064
to send a congratulatory note
and a bouquet.

37:13.098 --> 37:16.101
And you know
that I never heard back.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.936
Not a word. Radio silence.

37:17.969 --> 37:21.573
And this after she tried
to screw my boyfriend.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.242
Franchot was her costar
in that picture, you know.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.746
Yes, you mentioned it at dinner.

37:27.779 --> 37:31.417
She knew he was mine. That's
why she tried to take him away.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.753
But he rejected her advances,
of course.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.154
Told me everything.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.990
So then I married him,

37:39.024 --> 37:42.227
out of spite.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.397
Do you realize
that Bette Davis is responsible

37:45.431 --> 37:48.233
for one of my failed marriages?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.235
Personally responsible.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.004
And yet you still wanted her
to do this picture with you.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.173
I think it's because
you two survived all that

37:55.206 --> 37:57.343
and you realize that
you really should be friends.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.110
Friends?

37:59.144 --> 38:00.979
You think it's friendship

38:01.012 --> 38:02.280
I want from her?

38:02.314 --> 38:03.582
Is that what
you think?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.283
You're wrong. It's respect.

38:05.317 --> 38:08.153
It's the only thing I have
ever wanted from her.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.656
Or any of them, for that matter.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.091
And it's the one thing
I've never gotten.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.261
It took me until Mildred Pierce

38:16.294 --> 38:18.964
to be taken seriously
as an actress.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.099
And when I
won my Oscar,

38:21.132 --> 38:24.336
do you think I received
any congratulatory notes

38:24.370 --> 38:26.805
or bouquets?
No.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.208
Mm. But I did.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.977
From men.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.180
Men whose admiration
I already had

38:35.213 --> 38:38.550
and whose respect
I never craved.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.986
But not the women.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.722
None of the bitches
in this town.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.157
Least of all Queen Bitch,

38:46.191 --> 38:48.727
who always thought
she was better than me,

38:48.760 --> 38:52.431
more talented than me.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.867
You admire her.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.236
(exhales)

38:58.269 --> 39:00.238
(chuckles)

39:00.271 --> 39:04.209
I admire her talent

39:04.242 --> 39:07.713
and her craft.

39:07.746 --> 39:11.483
And I will have her respect.

39:11.517 --> 39:15.086
Even if I have to kill
both of us to get it.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.932
*

39:47.653 --> 39:50.088
(alarm ringing)

40:00.298 --> 40:02.734
(sighs)

40:17.148 --> 40:18.617
Keep practicing.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.351
Could be faster.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.757
(indistinct conversations)

40:29.961 --> 40:32.964
(indistinct conversations)

40:32.998 --> 40:35.734
(quietly):
Billy. Billy.

40:35.767 --> 40:39.070
Billy, how is
that new baby?

40:39.104 --> 40:40.806
(chuckles)

40:40.839 --> 40:44.576
Fred! Oh, looks
like you've lost some weight.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.745
Pablo.
Mother not so good.

40:46.778 --> 40:50.148
Pablo, how is your mother, dear?

40:50.181 --> 40:53.184
Dave.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.820
(chuckles)
Miss Crawford.

40:54.853 --> 40:58.924
How lovely to see you again
after all these years.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.359
(chuckles)

41:07.365 --> 41:09.735
It's small.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.575
And dirty.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.247
Okay, Mamacita,
let's go to work.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.561
Christ, she's at it again.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.228
Sucking up to the goddamn crew

41:37.262 --> 41:39.230
so she gets better lighting
and props.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.867
Maybe she's just
being nice, Mother.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.420
(exhales)

42:27.445 --> 42:30.281
Before noon, Lucille?

42:31.282 --> 42:34.285
Got enough for two?

42:50.468 --> 42:52.437
To us.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.706
Together at last.

42:54.740 --> 42:57.475
At last.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.885
Nervous?

43:06.918 --> 43:08.286
Terrified.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.722
I haven't done
a film in...

43:10.756 --> 43:11.990
Three years, Joan.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.358
You haven't worked
in three years.

43:15.493 --> 43:18.496
(laughs)

43:21.499 --> 43:23.401
You know,

43:23.434 --> 43:26.504
when I drove on the lot
this morning,

43:26.537 --> 43:29.274
saw the crew
bustling about,

43:29.307 --> 43:32.678
sets being built,
the smell of sawdust...

43:32.711 --> 43:37.082
It's magic
what we do, isn't it?

43:37.115 --> 43:38.416
All right,

43:38.449 --> 43:41.853
let's cut through
the bullshit.

43:41.887 --> 43:43.689
I don't like you,
you don't like me.

43:43.722 --> 43:45.657
But we need this picture
to work.

43:45.691 --> 43:48.426
Both of us. All I
ask is that you do

43:48.459 --> 43:50.295
your best work. Try.

43:50.328 --> 43:52.597
Because when
you're good, Joan,

43:52.630 --> 43:54.900
goddamn it, you're good.

43:58.904 --> 44:02.107
Do you really think so?

44:02.140 --> 44:04.275
Oh, Christ, you're
not going to cry.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.678
Yes, I really
think so.

44:06.712 --> 44:09.547
I've always thought so.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.820
Oh, one
last thing.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.856
Lose the
shoulder pads.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.658
I beg your pardon?

44:20.692 --> 44:22.728
And cut back
on the lipstick.

44:22.761 --> 44:25.063
You're playing a recluse
who hasn't seen the sun

44:25.096 --> 44:27.532
for 20 years,
for Christ's sake.

44:38.509 --> 44:42.347
You have a perfect face for
the movies, Miss Crawford.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.816
There are no bad angles.

44:44.850 --> 44:47.252
Thank you, Jimmy.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.254
(Aldrich and Bette
arguing indistinctly)

44:49.287 --> 44:51.890
Look, just give me
a chance to talk to her.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.659
We can work
this out...

44:54.692 --> 44:57.695
Are you talking about me?

44:57.729 --> 44:59.697
No.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.867
Yeah. I'm just
offering some ideas.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.869
Don't tell me
how to play my character

45:03.902 --> 45:05.737
before I've even shot a scene.

45:05.771 --> 45:09.007
I have done a lot
of hard work and preparation,

45:09.040 --> 45:11.276
and you are just trying
to throw me.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.677
I'm trying to help you.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.112
You want me to look bad,

45:14.145 --> 45:15.546
but I won't do it.

45:15.580 --> 45:19.117
My fans show up
to a Joan Crawford picture

45:19.150 --> 45:22.053
expecting to see Joan Crawford.

45:22.087 --> 45:23.721
This is not
a Joan Crawford picture.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.126
Mr. Aldrich,

45:28.159 --> 45:31.362
will you please
escort Miss Davis

45:31.396 --> 45:32.697
back to her dressing room

45:32.730 --> 45:35.133
so she can work
on her character?

45:35.166 --> 45:38.870
Or shall I get out of this
wheelchair and walk off the set?

45:38.904 --> 45:40.705
I'll handle it. Bette, please.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.707
BETTE:
Did you see her?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.776
She's ridiculous, Bob.
She's got falsies

45:44.810 --> 45:46.912
on under there.
Bette,

45:46.945 --> 45:49.714
it's the first day, okay?

45:49.747 --> 45:52.550
May I remind you I took out
a second mortgage on my house

45:52.583 --> 45:54.986
to make this picture? So don't
look at me as if I don't care.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.123
I've got to handle her
very carefully. She's nervous.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.724
And we got a lot
of work to do today.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.726
We haven't even decided
on your look yet,

46:01.759 --> 46:03.628
and your first scene
is straight up after lunch.

46:03.661 --> 46:05.630
I've got to get that right.

46:05.663 --> 46:09.034
Fine. Handle it.

46:15.540 --> 46:18.376
(bell rings)

46:24.515 --> 46:25.616
(man coughs)

46:25.650 --> 46:27.518
Scene 11, take one.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.328
(sighs)

46:37.362 --> 46:39.197
Joan?

46:39.230 --> 46:42.467
Joan, now,
in this scene,

46:42.500 --> 46:43.869
Blanche is looking at

46:43.902 --> 46:46.504
one of her early pictures on TV.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.406
There's your mark right there.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.211
Okay.

46:53.244 --> 46:54.379
Ready?

46:54.412 --> 46:57.548
Yeah.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.550
Camera's rolling.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.752
(whirring)

47:03.821 --> 47:05.823
And action.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.796
(woman on TV):
Everything.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.199
We were gonna be married.

47:16.935 --> 47:19.737
This girl, Dolly Merrick.

47:19.770 --> 47:23.408
Oh, Jack,
please try to understand.

47:23.441 --> 47:26.077
I married you because I was...

47:26.111 --> 47:29.247
We should've held
that shot a little longer.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.249
I told him that
when we were rehearsing,

47:31.282 --> 47:33.551
also when we shot it.

47:33.584 --> 47:36.687
But he wouldn't listen.

47:36.721 --> 47:39.690
I can't think of anything else.

47:39.724 --> 47:43.328
Still...

47:43.361 --> 47:47.565
it's a pretty good picture.

47:47.598 --> 47:50.401
(camera whirring)

47:50.435 --> 47:51.836
Cut.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.405
(chuckles)

47:54.439 --> 47:55.840
That's great work, Joan.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.109
Yeah?

47:58.143 --> 47:59.744
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

48:02.580 --> 48:04.549
Let's do another one, Bob.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.284
Right away.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.054
I'm just getting warmed up.

48:10.655 --> 48:12.290
(exhales)

48:12.323 --> 48:15.460
(whirring)

48:15.493 --> 48:18.063
These are wrong.
I want her to look demented.

48:21.166 --> 48:22.800
This one.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.702
Wigs.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.437
Funny fact for you, Bette.

48:26.471 --> 48:27.905
Joan wore this one

48:27.939 --> 48:31.276
in some early 1930s
MGM melodrama.

48:31.309 --> 48:34.645
And from the looks of it,
it hasn't been touched since.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.253

48:49.160 --> 48:52.597

beauty mark.

(chuckles)

48:56.701 --> 48:58.269
(chuckles)
Mm.

48:58.303 --> 49:01.806
My God, Mother, is that
how you really want to look?

49:04.042 --> 49:06.111
Just wait.

49:08.046 --> 49:10.648
No, I just think there are

49:10.681 --> 49:13.351
too many words
in this section, Bob.

49:13.384 --> 49:15.786
God, I miss
the silent pictures.

49:15.820 --> 49:18.523

She can't be serious.

Hello, Daddy.

50:28.726 --> 50:30.595
All right, all right!

50:30.628 --> 50:32.830
Everybody back to work!
Back to work.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.865

50:51.048 --> 50:53.784
ROBERT: Action.
BETTE: Blanche,

50:53.818 --> 50:56.787
you aren't ever gonna
sell this house.

50:56.821 --> 51:00.125
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it...

51:00.158 --> 51:02.260
either.

51:02.293 --> 51:03.694
(beep)

51:03.728 --> 51:06.231
ROBERT:
And... action.

51:07.265 --> 51:09.734
Blanche,

51:09.767 --> 51:12.603
you aren't ever gonna sell
this house.

51:12.637 --> 51:14.405
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.073
Bob,

51:16.107 --> 51:19.577
isn't that lighting
unnecessarily harsh?

51:19.610 --> 51:22.813
Oh, we haven't balanced the
footage yet, Joan. Don't worry.

51:22.847 --> 51:24.749
Don't worry about it.

51:24.782 --> 51:26.151
Blanche,

51:26.184 --> 51:29.987
you aren't ever gonna
sell this house.

51:30.020 --> 51:34.259
And you aren't
ever gonna leave it...

51:34.292 --> 51:36.261
either.

52:33.083 --> 52:37.822
* Soon he will open the door *

52:37.855 --> 52:40.825
* Don't think because *

52:40.858 --> 52:44.629
* There's a ring
on your finger *

52:44.662 --> 52:48.466
* You needn't try anymore *

52:48.499 --> 52:50.701
* For wives *

52:50.735 --> 52:54.305
* Should always be lovers, too *

52:54.339 --> 52:57.007
Welcome to the house
that fear built.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.409
Come on in.

52:58.443 --> 53:00.511
* He comes home to you *

53:00.545 --> 53:02.847
* I'm warning you *

53:02.880 --> 53:05.683
Just the two of us?
The three of us.

53:05.716 --> 53:08.686
Oh, didn't I specify that
in my invitation?

53:08.719 --> 53:12.089
I suppose you expected one
of my legendary dinner parties.

53:12.122 --> 53:14.392
No, Gloria and Jimmy Stewart

53:14.425 --> 53:16.561
and the Fondas are on Wednesday.

53:16.594 --> 53:18.863
Tonight it's just us gals.

53:18.896 --> 53:21.866
Sit down, please.
The sofa's comfy.

53:21.899 --> 53:25.736
* You may not see him again *

53:25.770 --> 53:27.772
*

53:32.477 --> 53:35.580
Can I get you ladies
something to drink?

53:35.613 --> 53:37.415
Scotch.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.784
Just a glass.

53:39.817 --> 53:41.952
I take it that's
not Pepsi-Cola.

53:41.986 --> 53:43.721
Vodka. 100 proof.

53:43.754 --> 53:46.724
I say if you're going to drink,
drink something you like.

53:46.757 --> 53:48.125
I'll be right back.

53:48.158 --> 53:49.226
Dining room's through there.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.696
I hope you gals brought
your appetites.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.064
* Ready *

53:54.098 --> 53:55.966
It's an ambush.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.402
She's out for blood.

53:57.435 --> 53:59.036
You gonna give it to her?

53:59.069 --> 54:00.771
Are you?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.542
BETTE:
Fish Jell-O.

54:04.575 --> 54:07.378
Goody.
No, it's aspic, darling.

54:07.412 --> 54:08.979
It's all the rage.

54:09.013 --> 54:10.581
I thought it'd be
the perfect dish

54:10.615 --> 54:13.418
for our little tГЄte-Г -trois.

54:13.451 --> 54:15.920
Something substantial,

54:15.953 --> 54:17.755
but transparent.

54:17.788 --> 54:19.424
* So alone *

54:19.457 --> 54:20.991
All right, ladies.

54:21.025 --> 54:23.494
You know what I need,
and you know what the fans want.

54:23.528 --> 54:27.398
So feel free to let 'er rip.

54:27.432 --> 54:30.067
* Alone *

54:30.100 --> 54:34.138
* Watching lovers passing by *

54:34.171 --> 54:37.742
So, who gets top billing?

54:37.775 --> 54:40.144
Oh, Bette, of course.
I mean, she plays

54:40.177 --> 54:42.112
the title role.
It only makes sense.

54:42.146 --> 54:46.083
Both roles are
tremendously important.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.486
You know, Hedda,
I have been wanting

54:48.519 --> 54:51.088
to work with Bette since 1944,

54:51.121 --> 54:54.492
when I first went
to Warner Brothers.

54:54.525 --> 54:57.928
And when I found What Ever
Happened to Baby Jane?,

54:57.962 --> 55:00.765
I sent it to Bob Aldrich
and told him

55:00.798 --> 55:03.501
in no uncertain terms that this

55:03.534 --> 55:06.771
was for Bette
and me only.

55:06.804 --> 55:10.975
I was thrilled. Think of
it, Joan Crawford was

55:11.008 --> 55:13.878
a big star when I arrived
fresh off the boat.

55:13.911 --> 55:16.514
Such a lovely thing to say.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.516
Fascinating.

55:18.549 --> 55:22.487
* I want to be wanted *

55:22.520 --> 55:24.522
* I want someone *

55:24.555 --> 55:26.957
Ah.

55:26.991 --> 55:30.561
Oh, how lovely.
(chuckles)

55:30.595 --> 55:33.063
What are you serving
for dessert?

55:33.097 --> 55:34.799
HEDDA:
We're skipping dessert.

55:34.832 --> 55:38.202
I'm already getting diabetes.

55:38.235 --> 55:40.471
* I want to be wanted *

55:40.505 --> 55:42.907
Dateline: Los Angeles.

55:42.940 --> 55:46.877
Stars of the night sky
tend to keep to fixed orbits

55:46.911 --> 55:49.246
and never interfere
with one another.

55:49.279 --> 55:52.683
Things sometimes operate
that way in Hollywood, too.

55:52.717 --> 55:55.019
Bette Davis and Joan Crawford,

55:55.052 --> 55:57.021
stars of equal magnitude

55:57.054 --> 56:00.858
who ruled in motion pictures
during the fabulous '30s,

56:00.891 --> 56:02.860
never got to know one another.

56:02.893 --> 56:06.030
Now, in the Indian summer
of their careers,

56:06.063 --> 56:08.433
they're about to.

57:36.353 --> 57:39.356
Lose the shoulder pads
and cut back on the lipstick.

57:39.389 --> 57:43.260
You're playing a recluse
who hasn't seen the sun
for 20 years, for Christ's sake.

57:43.293 --> 57:47.498
Poor Bette.
So dreadfully overweight.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.437
It's gonna take an hour
at this time.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.006
Wow, look at Stan's yard.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.175
Someone's been busy.
(laughs)

57:58.208 --> 58:01.345
Clearly not in ours.
Maybe Henry can do
some work today.

58:01.378 --> 58:03.347
Yeah.

58:03.380 --> 58:05.816
I forget your back
is always bad
this time of year.

58:05.850 --> 58:07.518
Only when
there are leaves--

58:11.856 --> 58:13.824
When did you
wash this last?

58:14.859 --> 58:16.460
The Americans.

(voices overlapping)

58:25.703 --> 58:27.705
Don't touch me!

58:31.175 --> 58:32.877
Legion.
DAVID: Is this real?

58:32.910 --> 58:35.680
All new Wednesdays at 10:00.
On FX.

58:37.214 --> 58:39.717
What kind of a clown
do you think you are?

58:39.750 --> 58:42.319
You know, the sad clown,
the distraught clown.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.388
More like
a dead-inside clown.

58:47.424 --> 58:50.394
-What are you doing? Chip!
-I'll pick those up.

58:50.427 --> 58:52.663
Oh, God!
